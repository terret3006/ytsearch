remember that those words being

403.319 --> 408.44
used I mean programming language is its

406.12 --> 408.44
own

410.639 --> 417.36
thing it has been for a long

414.319 --> 421.40000000000003
time and probably developed a lot since

417.36 --> 421.40000000000003
I last like really checked it out

431.4 --> 437.52
[Music]

435.199 --> 443.08000000000004
right who's

437.52 --> 443.08
Bill what oh Bill n signs

445.759 --> 451.319
here yeah he's been here for a long time

457.0 --> 463.52
right also my prayers go out to uh

462.039 --> 468.0
skeptic

463.52 --> 470.31899999999996
936 he got into an accident again

468.0 --> 472.879
unfortunately it's been very unlucky in

470.319 --> 472.879
the last

473.36 --> 478.319
year right but anyway hope he'll make a

477.199 --> 481.2
speedy

478.319 --> 484.269
recovery

481.2 --> 484.269
[Music]

497.3 --> 500.689
[Music]

502.36 --> 507.52000000000004
uh what was kind of funny is that I was

505.44 --> 510.28
at uh

507.52 --> 513.36
Nathan's who's been like uh playing all

510.28 --> 516.159
kinds of premieres over the

513.36 --> 520.519
weekend and my backup account or wian

516.159 --> 521.959
bear did got a wrench there I I never

520.519 --> 526.6
yeah that was

521.959 --> 526.5999999999999
new that's kind of cool I

529.2 --> 533.9590000000001
guess and barely any whining and

534.44 --> 539.399
complaining about me in the chat so yeah

538.04 --> 540.959
that was nice maybe they were all all

539.399 --> 542.32
gone or something I don't know exactly

540.959 --> 547.56
what it was

542.32 --> 547.5600000000001
but yeah it was doable

548.04 --> 553.519
again also

551.04 --> 556.3199999999999
yeah I've just been thinking about this

553.519 --> 560.04
whole gifts and go

556.32 --> 562.2
thing and the ultimatum that I made and

560.04 --> 563.64
it is it has really turned out to kind

562.2 --> 566.2
of be a

563.64 --> 568.12
fiasco I've talked to Adam mein about

566.2 --> 571.6800000000001
this also over

568.12 --> 574.399
Skype like it was

571.68 --> 576.959
just it was something I did in anger and

574.399 --> 576.959
it's really

577.72 --> 582.72
stupid and this is a problem this is

580.64 --> 585.92
like a personal problem it's a problem

582.72 --> 588.8000000000001
that led me to like a pretty messed up

585.92 --> 590.279
situation this Saturday even as I

588.8 --> 594.399
mentioned

590.279 --> 597.64
yesterday and like yeah I need to to

594.399 --> 601.12
like really work on this or it'll get me

597.64 --> 601.12
into more trouble

603.68 --> 609.0
it's kind of weird because like it has

605.92 --> 612.68
to do with the whole rage stuff in the

609.0 --> 615.2
past I always bottled it up I would just

612.68 --> 617.3199999999999
like be completely stoic about it be

615.2 --> 619.44
feel sick

617.32 --> 623.0790000000001
maybe but it would keep me out of

619.44 --> 625.7600000000001
trouble but I shouldn't yeah that was

623.079 --> 628.5999999999999
actually the better way to do it might

625.76 --> 630.24
not be the most glamorous way to go

628.6 --> 633.88
about

630.24 --> 637.9590000000001
but like that rage is potential if I

633.88 --> 639.519
unleash it it's just dangerous for

637.959 --> 641.8389999999999
me

639.519 --> 646.16
and

641.839 --> 646.1600000000001
yeah I want to do something about

653.399 --> 656.399
it

656.6 --> 662.2
h right but yeah I I've been just kind

660.04 --> 664.76
of like wondering what you guys would

662.2 --> 664.76
think about

666.519 --> 674.44
it cuz it's not like I'm super eager to

669.92 --> 674.4399999999999
get back to Fed but I do kind of

675.0 --> 682.04
like want to fix this situation like the

678.519 --> 682.04
gifts and go is not really

687.44 --> 693.5600000000001
moving and like I'm not expecting you

690.92 --> 695.76
guys to fill it up I think that you guys

693.56 --> 696.8
are probably just fine with me being on

695.76 --> 699.8
my own

696.8 --> 700.56
here and I've been fine being on my own

699.8 --> 703.3599999999999
I

700.56 --> 707.2399999999999
mean shows in the last month have just

703.36 --> 709.9590000000001
been fine better actually just got more

707.24 --> 709.9590000000001
room and all

710.16 --> 715.6
that but yeah I was just wondering what

712.44 --> 715.6
do you guys think about

717.959 --> 720.959
that

723.56 --> 727.76
or maybe you really don't care at all I

725.56 --> 727.76
don't

728.24 --> 732.8
know oh man my neck is

747.88 --> 750.88
just

751.48 --> 755.5600000000001
or nothing nothing at

755.82 --> 758.999
[Music]

768.639 --> 775.279
all but uh yeah it seems to that I got a

771.959 --> 780.7199999999999
mission I mean I already kind of

775.279 --> 784.76
like addressed it but I mean I must

780.72 --> 787.72
must deal with it better even better I

784.76 --> 789.6
kind of like Unleashed it and now I need

787.72 --> 791.32
to like it's not really going to be

789.6 --> 793.48
completely in back in the bottle again

791.32 --> 796.6800000000001
but I must

793.48 --> 796.6800000000001
somehow do

804.639 --> 812.16
it hey Richard G good to see

807.76 --> 812.16
you want to see you ruin your

812.32 --> 817.6800000000001
friendship

814.0 --> 820.959
Burn whiches yeah but I'm not burning

817.68 --> 823.8
bries even back then it's like I just

820.959 --> 825.92
made sort of an ultimatum and with the

823.8 --> 829.12
rage I just thought like yeah that could

825.92 --> 829.12
work and

829.759 --> 834.8000000000001
no instead what I should have done is

832.48 --> 837.759
just like without the stupid ultimatum

834.8 --> 840.7589999999999
and just keep going and say

837.759 --> 840.759
hey

841.519 --> 847.04
like I'll just take a break for a month

843.72 --> 850.72
or something cuz I kind of was going to

847.04 --> 853.959
need that anyway but yeah I mean on the

850.72 --> 856.48
other hand it was a kind of an

853.959 --> 859.04
Abrupt

856.48 --> 861.9590000000001
situation where I was kind of like

859.04 --> 864.36
leaning on things and then like I had to

861.959 --> 868.0
let it go and I kind of like

864.36 --> 870.04
moved maneuvered in the other direction

868.0 --> 871.6
to like get guantee that I wouldn't like

870.04 --> 874.639
try to latch back

871.6 --> 876.72
on I needed to like distance myself a

874.639 --> 879.0
bit and and that's what I did and hey

876.72 --> 881.6700000000001
it's turned out fine I mean the show is

879.0 --> 884.639
just doing fine wouldn't you

881.67 --> 888.199
[Music]

884.639 --> 891.04
say and yeah I hello

888.199 --> 894.3199999999999
AI I am going to keep doing what I

891.04 --> 896.8389999999999
do you don't need to go back at fed yeah

894.32 --> 900.36
but I do also like Miss the guys

896.839 --> 904.0400000000001
there like I guys from the G+ we used to

900.36 --> 906.36
like have conversations and all that and

904.04 --> 906.36
I don't

908.0 --> 912.839
know I mean I feel like I'm probably not

910.959 --> 915.5189999999999
even going to be all that active even if

912.839 --> 915.519
I did go

922.32 --> 925.5600000000001
back a

927.6 --> 930.6
glitch

932.6 --> 935.3190000000001
they real

935.44 --> 940.72
friends that

938.44 --> 942.5600000000001
that's that's a kind of weird thing to

940.72 --> 945.399
say

942.56 --> 949.7199999999999
clutch have I spoken to Nathan since I

945.399 --> 952.92
left no but I really didn't speak to

949.72 --> 955.839
Nathan before I left either

952.92 --> 957.5999999999999
so there's not nothing really changing

955.839 --> 960.48
about

957.6 --> 962.639
that

960.48 --> 965.399
like Nathan and me never really spoke in

962.639 --> 968.6
all these years

965.399 --> 971.0
like like the amounts that were just

968.6 --> 973.839
like a direct one-on-one communication

971.0 --> 976.639
is like two

973.839 --> 980.759
times in eight years or

976.639 --> 982.92
something right but the guys on the G+

980.759 --> 985.1990000000001
panel yeah I'm always talking with them

982.92 --> 987.519
and then after the shows end then we're

985.199 --> 990.519
still talking a lot of the

987.519 --> 990.519
time

992.639 --> 997.92
right and I have still spoken with Adam

994.8 --> 1001.37
but Adam is also kind of I don't know

997.92 --> 1004.789
acting weird I think it feels

1001.37 --> 1004.789
[Music]

1005.16 --> 1009.88
weird like it's kind of being cryptic or

1011.56 --> 1017.1199999999999
something does Nathan talk to anyone

1013.92 --> 1021.16
else on his panel outside fed

1017.12 --> 1025.48
no no he never really did that much he's

1021.16 --> 1025.48
always been too busy so to

1029.56 --> 1034.1799999999998
[Music]

1042.24 --> 1049.679
speak reach out to the G+ guys yeah well

1046.24 --> 1052.72
drose is a G+ guy he called in yesterday

1049.679 --> 1054.3600000000001
so it's not like they're all like oh

1052.72 --> 1056.76
distancing themselves from me or

1054.36 --> 1058.77
anything it's just that we don't really

1056.76 --> 1064.16
have a lot of opportunity to

1058.77 --> 1068.0
[Music]

1064.16 --> 1068.0
talk and I do miss

1077.4 --> 1080.4
that

1085.6 --> 1090.32
you find my channel when I was talking

1087.52 --> 1090.32
[Â __Â ] to Sean

1090.4 --> 1095.799
Hawkins all

1092.559 --> 1095.799
right that's

1107.32 --> 1110.32
funny

1111.36 --> 1115.3999999999999
what was the reason I left well it was

1113.64 --> 1116.64
because of like how Nathan just talked

1115.4 --> 1120.8400000000001
to

1116.64 --> 1124.7990000000002
me on the live show that's that's it cuz

1120.84 --> 1126.36
like that's I don't want that again but

1124.799 --> 1129.72
then again there's a good chance that

1126.36 --> 1131.9599999999998
even if I'd go back like I'm just like

1129.72 --> 1136.559
not going to speak

1131.96 --> 1139.44
up during like the live show it just

1136.559 --> 1143.76
no I'm not really going to like try to

1139.44 --> 1149.4
interrupt yeah like that thing is

1143.76 --> 1149.4
yeah I'm not entirely sure like what

1149.64 --> 1153.48
like what I'd even be

1159.33 --> 1163.6789999999999
[Music]

1160.76 --> 1165.8799999999999
doing right oh not good for my mental

1163.679 --> 1168.96
health well it's really only the issues

1165.88 --> 1172.3200000000002
like with Nathan

1168.96 --> 1174.1200000000001
when he acts out something right that's

1172.32 --> 1176.72
the part that's not really good for my

1174.12 --> 1179.7199999999998
mental health but only when I'm like on

1222.36 --> 1229.36
smart and cool and like I can like

1229.36 --> 1233.9189999999999
they'll just get

1231.0 --> 1235.84
it like I don't need to I don't need a

1233.919 --> 1238.24
bunch of flunkies around me that'll just

1235.84 --> 1240.9189999999999
like praise me and not really understand

1238.24 --> 1245.24
me that's

1240.919 --> 1245.24
lame that's not much of a

1249.039 --> 1255.679
friendship right and fed team was kind

1252.0 --> 1260.12
of like opportunity for me also to like

1255.679 --> 1260.1200000000001
figure out detailed things

1260.84 --> 1263.84
okay

1285.799 --> 1291.44
no all right anyway it's just has been

1288.4 --> 1291.44
on my mind a bit

1292.159 --> 1298.64
and also because like I'm not I yeah I'm

1296.2 --> 1302.88
kind of in a Restless State since this

1298.64 --> 1305.6000000000001
weekend and that makes me like just want

1302.88 --> 1310.0
to have that opportunity to be able to

1305.6 --> 1310.0
talk with people just to get my mind of

1311.159 --> 1317.0800000000002
things I'll put you on the map yeah

1315.48 --> 1320.4
right and there's a lot of people that

1317.08 --> 1323.12
find me through fed as

1320.4 --> 1326.96
well right although

1323.12 --> 1328.36
like I mean I feel I can definitely

1326.96 --> 1331.32
handle

1328.36 --> 1333.08
it like it's not like oh my God I really

1331.32 --> 1337.84
need to go back

1333.08 --> 1342.559
to the FED because oh I'm I'm declining

1337.84 --> 1342.559
or anything I just kind of miss the

1346.96 --> 1349.96
guys

1362.03 --> 1365.42
[Music]

1367.55 --> 1374.1699999999998
[Music]

1376.44 --> 1383.1200000000001
all right so yeah Gavin be like nah like

1380.32 --> 1383.12
that's not going to

1385.99 --> 1389.17
[Music]

1397.679 --> 1405.2
work Fe EB

1402.0 --> 1405.2
[Music]

1406.88 --> 1409.88
what

1417.6 --> 1421.76
righted give it a short amount of

1422.919 --> 1427.3600000000001
time I'm not entirely sure what you mean

1425.52 --> 1429.72
with that I mean I've already given it

1427.36 --> 1429.7199999999998
like a

1436.679 --> 1443.159
month the my point of matters that's

1440.679 --> 1444.279
fine I know you're a glober and I know

1443.159 --> 1447.0800000000002
you're

1444.279 --> 1448.88
not you're not trying to drive me apart

1447.08 --> 1450.36
on purpose and I know that I've been

1448.88 --> 1452.48
doing

1450.36 --> 1454.84
fine with my own

1452.48 --> 1459.24
show getting higher viewers and

1454.84 --> 1459.24
everything so I'm I'm well aware of

1466.799 --> 1469.799
that

1505.36 --> 1509.76
I didn't know man I it's it's kind of

1507.48 --> 1514.44
hard to figure out how all of it is even

1509.76 --> 1514.44
happening really and I wonder

1516.44 --> 1521.559
like like maybe I've just been not doing

1519.88 --> 1525.1200000000001
very well

1521.559 --> 1526.6789999999999
personally like seem to have more nerves

1525.12 --> 1529.6789999999999
and

1526.679 --> 1529.679
more

1530.0 --> 1534.96
restlessness as since but it's it's

1533.039 --> 1537.559
really I think just the overall

1534.96 --> 1537.559
financial

1538.32 --> 1544.6399999999999
situation like it's not great and I'm

1541.64 --> 1546.7990000000002
like I'm really struggling to keep up

1544.64 --> 1548.96
financially I mean the show's been going

1546.799 --> 1552.44
fine and I do get support from you guys

1548.96 --> 1555.2
and I do keep managing somehow to get

1552.44 --> 1555.2
through things

1555.76 --> 1562.0
but it's just I feel overall under more

1559.08 --> 1564.84
pressure and it's not because of

1562.0 --> 1566.679
people because of fed it's just it's

1564.84 --> 1569.76
been like that for a

1566.679 --> 1572.44
while and I'm having trouble with

1569.76 --> 1577.039
it and it makes me

1572.44 --> 1577.039
overreact which is like extremely

1579.63 --> 1582.729
[Music]

1586.6 --> 1589.6
inconvenient

1593.76 --> 1596.76
what

1597.48 --> 1602.76
no I mean I could go on other people's

1599.919 --> 1606.64
shows but like what I have to offer is

1602.76 --> 1607.8799999999999
just talking and subjects and my

1606.64 --> 1611.3600000000001
expertise

1607.88 --> 1614.1200000000001
arguably that's it like I'm not an

1611.36 --> 1616.1999999999998
editor I mean I could do some moderating

1614.12 --> 1619.6
but I mean there's always people have

1616.2 --> 1619.6000000000001
moderators so

1620.159 --> 1625.0
professional helper yeah what do you

1622.0 --> 1625.0
think like I

1626.0 --> 1632.48
already I got social worker I am having

1629.6 --> 1634.76
an appointment with him talking about it

1632.48 --> 1634.76
but I

1636.88 --> 1642.48
mean it doesn't really change the

1639.799 --> 1642.48
overall

1646.32 --> 1649.52
conditions what

1650.08 --> 1654.36
okay Nathan's going live

1660.44 --> 1668.3600000000001
early yeah expertise that's

1664.24 --> 1668.36
right subject

1676.519 --> 1679.519
expertise

1696.919 --> 1702.3200000000002
Fe you running the same issues with fed

1699.399 --> 1704.4399999999998
yeah well that's a good point AI yeah

1702.32 --> 1706.48
that could very it could run into the

1704.44 --> 1708.48
same issues I mean it's been a repeating

1706.48 --> 1710.679
issue for a while it's part of the

1708.48 --> 1712.44
reason why I just

1710.679 --> 1716.1200000000001
left

1712.44 --> 1716.1200000000001
because I was sick of

1724.32 --> 1727.76
it right but I

1728.08 --> 1733.519
mean I could try to just if I go back

1731.96 --> 1736.679
manage it

1733.519 --> 1739.159
differently and just say like okay some

1736.679 --> 1741.0
days I'll just not going to join fed

1739.159 --> 1743.919
like when it's all grouchy and [Â __Â ] and

1741.0 --> 1747.12
then like I'll just stay out of it just

1743.919 --> 1750.3200000000002
do something else then right the problem

1747.12 --> 1752.2399999999998
was also on my part that it was just

1750.32 --> 1755.9189999999999
like it was something I would just do

1752.24 --> 1757.3990000000001
every day every time so it it was like a

1755.919 --> 1761.159
real

1757.399 --> 1763.9189999999999
habit and it literally drained all the

1761.159 --> 1763.919
time in my

1766.32 --> 1769.32
day

1770.0 --> 1776.48
and to be fair since I'm not part of fed

1773.399 --> 1780.5189999999998
anymore I've had more time to

1776.48 --> 1780.519
just work things out

1782.96 --> 1787.039
Etc do things at my own

1796.32 --> 1799.32
pace

1800.97 --> 1804.19
[Music]

1830.399 --> 1835.84
right by the way I don't really know

1832.039 --> 1839.519
what you mean with nonprofessional

1835.84 --> 1841.8799999999999
help I mean I have

1839.519 --> 1845.6
friends that I can call over the phone

1841.88 --> 1848.159
I'm pretty good with my roommates like I

1845.6 --> 1848.1589999999999
talk with

1849.64 --> 1853.8400000000001
them could talk with my dad I can talk

1852.039 --> 1856.36
with my healer I can

1853.84 --> 1860.799
talk make an appointment with my social

1856.36 --> 1864.8799999999999
worker and friend in so there is people

1860.799 --> 1864.8799999999999
that I contact and that I talk

1865.36 --> 1874.6
with like for support emotional support

1869.76 --> 1878.8799999999999
and all that and just to work things out

1874.6 --> 1878.8799999999999
so like that's not really an

1881.72 --> 1889.159
issue person support groups

1886.159 --> 1889.159
really

1894.88 --> 1901.88
what now I'm not going to go to

1897.6 --> 1906.04
rageaholics Anonymous or something okay

1901.88 --> 1909.13

yeah just sharing it here it's like it's

2647.0 --> 2652.52
interesting this is an old guy like it's

2650.119 --> 2655.0
not about fed but I mean it's fairy

2652.52 --> 2655.0
telling

2655.04 --> 2663.16
though like this problem with people and

2659.4 --> 2667.28
consensus science is just not not just

2663.16 --> 2673.04
limited to like the

2667.28 --> 2673.0400000000004
Earth it's all kinds of uh

2674.119 --> 2679.96
fields and this little video really

2677.2 --> 2679.96
emphasized

2681.559 --> 2685.6400000000003
that so I want to share

2685.68 --> 2691.0
that also yeah there is a weird thing

2688.44 --> 2693.2000000000003
going on out there apparently like

2691.0 --> 2697.92
Richard G yesterday had this comment

2693.2 --> 2700.1189999999997
about lethal elect El cars or whatever

2697.92 --> 2702.2000000000003
and then that got deleted

2700.119 --> 2704.1600000000003
mysteriously apparently that sort of

2702.2 --> 2706.839
thing is happening out there there's

2704.16 --> 2709.8799999999997
like censorship about dangers of

2706.839 --> 2712.0
electric cars like on on Twitter too

2709.88 --> 2714.6400000000003
like David Ike had a

2712.0 --> 2717.88
post where he tried to upload a video

2714.64 --> 2721.0789999999997
about it and then it just refused to

2717.88 --> 2722.15
upload about that subject that's like

2721.079 --> 2724.88
very

2722.15 --> 2727.88
[Music]

2724.88 --> 2727.88
odd

2731.49 --> 2734.5899999999997
[Music]

2750.16 --> 2757.319
looks

2751.52 --> 2759.72
BR well it maybe

2757.319 --> 2763.72
but I mean Elon Musk it does not have

2759.72 --> 2766.319
power over YouTube so it can't be just

2763.72 --> 2766.319
him it's

2767.04 --> 2773.319
[Music]

2769.64 --> 2775.4
weird what the video yesterday Professor

2773.319 --> 2780.2799999999997
saying black holes are not

2775.4 --> 2780.28
science and he lost his sture

2783.68 --> 2788.16
wow yeah it's all about story

2786.359 --> 2791.359
consensus you

2788.16 --> 2795.359
don't say that the story is science yeah

2791.359 --> 2795.359
then you are not a scientist

2804.2 --> 2807.1
anymore anyway good to see you slow B

2829.079 --> 2832.8
also what was kind of weird yesterday

2831.04 --> 2835.16
that my comment section was getting all

2832.8 --> 2839.96
filled that's nice I I like it that

2835.16 --> 2839.96
there's more non-roll [Â __Â ]

2841.0 --> 2846.559
commenters called kicked him out yeah no

2843.64 --> 2848.52
doubt well Richard like

2846.559 --> 2852.2000000000003
n g

2848.52 --> 2856.72
Richard apparently had a real beef with

2852.2 --> 2859.16
me saying that VR is

2856.72 --> 2861.8799999999997
dangerous cuz he's apparently really

2859.16 --> 2863.839
into it and just kept asking it's like

2861.88 --> 2866.2400000000002
how is it dangerous how is it dangerous

2863.839 --> 2866.24
like

2866.52 --> 2871.2
yeah he didn't like that that was

2874.559 --> 2879.6800000000003
weird right but I mean yeah I mean you

2877.079 --> 2880.6400000000003
can't really compare the dangers of VR

2879.68 --> 2884.8799999999997
like

2880.64 --> 2887.4
with exploding cars or anything or brain

2884.88 --> 2890.52
chips that create scarring Etc it's not

2887.4 --> 2893.52
the same class but it will aggravate

2890.52 --> 2894.68
social isolation like it definitely will

2893.52 --> 2898.28
do

2894.68 --> 2900.0789999999997
that just like mobile phones

2898.28 --> 2903.079
have

2900.079 --> 2903.079
right

2904.64 --> 2907.64
uh

2916.24 --> 2921.8799999999997
I don't Kevin B I don't really know who

2919.839 --> 2925.0789999999997
those people

2921.88 --> 2925.079
[Music]

2931.24 --> 2936.9199999999996
are techs are all friends so yeah maybe

2935.04 --> 2940.16
maybe it is is like a a plan thing I

2936.92 --> 2944.4
mean electric cars is not just Elon

2940.16 --> 2947.839
Musk it is a technocratic

2944.4 --> 2949.64
plan so maybe they did like just agree

2947.839 --> 2950.79
to like censor that sort of thing I

2949.64 --> 2959.569
don't

2950.79 --> 2959.569
[Music]

2959.92 --> 2967.52
know Peter PayPal

2964.52 --> 2967.52
okay

2970.16 --> 2976.2799999999997
vaguely remember that name but yeah it's

2973.359 --> 2979.48
from PayPal sure oh PayPal's not giving

2976.28 --> 2983.079
me any trouble I'm very thankful for

2979.48 --> 2985.359
it cuz I wouldn't really know what to do

2983.079 --> 2985.3590000000004

[Music]

3008.64 --> 3015.2799999999997
H hydrogen fuel cell is superior

3012.28 --> 3015.28
technology

3016.96 --> 3021.599
maybe I

3018.68 --> 3024.44
mean it's better than just a giant

3021.599 --> 3027.44
hauling around a giant battery all the

3024.44 --> 3027.44
time

3027.68 --> 3033.319
mean electric cars are really not not

3030.839 --> 3035.24
that great at all and they tend to just

3033.319 --> 3038.599
cost more

3035.24 --> 3043.24
electricity like more actual energy than

3038.599 --> 3043.2400000000002
regular fuel consuming cars

3049.0 --> 3054.119
so and hey the hydrogen fuel cell

3051.599 --> 3056.319
technology was even there in the 90s in

3054.119 --> 3059.1600000000003
the Netherlands

3056.319 --> 3061.88
and like all these buses going on

3059.16 --> 3063.96
them but then like they were just like

3061.88 --> 3066.4
getting all hyped at oh danger it was

3063.96 --> 3068.359
even though it literally never went

3066.4 --> 3072.76
wrong not one

3068.359 --> 3075.5989999999997
time did it ever explode not one damn

3072.76 --> 3077.44
time and they still like phased it out

3075.599 --> 3080.1600000000003
because it was so dangerous so they

3077.44 --> 3083.04
obviously

3080.16 --> 3086.16
like it was just top down decided like

3083.04 --> 3088.359
oh no we're going to go for electric

3086.16 --> 3092.92
so all those other things that work no

3088.359 --> 3092.92
that we're not going to promote that

3102.24 --> 3106.799
anymore

3103.799 --> 3106.799
at

3114.359 --> 3117.359

3127.799 --> 3133.88

3144.28 --> 3147.28
great

3167.799 --> 3172.119
all right but one thing I want to

3170.079 --> 3173.96
address is that I'm really hearing it

3172.119 --> 3176.88
around more and more it's kind of funny

3173.96 --> 3179.48
Owen Benjamin addressed it a while ago

3176.88 --> 3182.0
but all these anarchists and like even

3179.48 --> 3184.799
Eric debay is like being like that and

3182.0 --> 3188.119
I'm like you guys are really [Â __Â ]

3184.799 --> 3191.2
stupid like that's really

3188.119 --> 3192.92
dumb like oh Anarchy oh everybody just

3191.2 --> 3196.799
gets their plot of

3192.92 --> 3200.839
land I mean that video he

3196.799 --> 3206.68
posted that was a really dumb video like

3200.839 --> 3209.2799999999997
really really dumb did anybody see that

3206.68 --> 3211.72
that was embarrassing like oh everybody

3209.28 --> 3214.799
gets a plot of land oh really and then

3211.72 --> 3217.0
what is to prevent your neighbors from

3214.799 --> 3219.88
just teaming up and then just killing

3217.0 --> 3222.079
you and taking your land like that's

3219.88 --> 3224.96
legal

3222.079 --> 3226.92
then right oh it's it's not legal oh

3224.96 --> 3228.64
really who's going to enforce that how

3226.92 --> 3230.599
are they going to enforce that oh oh you

3228.64 --> 3233.16
need some kind of body to help you

3230.599 --> 3235.44
protect your rights so you can safely

3233.16 --> 3238.24
keep your plot of land without all

3235.44 --> 3242.88
that's just trying to steal yeah what is

3238.24 --> 3245.359
that called H uh government yeah that's

3242.88 --> 3245.359
what that's

3246.72 --> 3253.2799999999997
called it was so

3250.48 --> 3255.92
stupid like just because governments are

3253.28 --> 3257.92
acting really bad and are just being

3255.92 --> 3259.2400000000002
predatory doesn't mean that we don't

3257.92 --> 3264.0
need

3259.24 --> 3264.0
it it just don't need it to be like

3264.079 --> 3267.079
this

3273.799 --> 3277.52
FL slowly becoming a reality for so many

3275.92 --> 3279.16
people yeah well they're getting a lot

3277.52 --> 3281.44
of people are getting used to it they're

3279.16 --> 3284.1189999999997
not necessarily being outspoken about it

3281.44 --> 3287.0
but people are getting used to Flat

3284.119 --> 3289.799
Earth out there that is a

3287.0 --> 3293.839
fact like if you bring up Flat Earth

3289.799 --> 3293.839
nobody's going to be truly shocked about

3294.079 --> 3301.3590000000004
it now well 10 years ago yeah they would

3297.76 --> 3304.1600000000003
have been like what are you talking

3301.359 --> 3306.96
about now it's like oh oh you're a flat

3304.16 --> 3306.96
earther

3309.16 --> 3314.2

3312.04 --> 3317.119
globe believer they might still get very

3314.2 --> 3321.5989999999997
triggered or something but on average

3317.119 --> 3321.599

yeah many an don't know how to garden or

3358.839 --> 3364.0
butcher or yeah there's a lot of things

3360.96 --> 3366.4
you need to do but I mean it's not even

about

3366.44 --> 3371.599
[Music]

3367.92 --> 3374.48
self-sufficiency like it's

3371.599 --> 3379.319
about rights

3374.48 --> 3381.2
yeah there's no rights in Anarchy that's

3379.319 --> 3383.88
an

3381.2 --> 3388.5589999999997
illusion you could think of there being

3383.88 --> 3390.799
rights but there aren't rights are

3388.559 --> 3393.48
enforced if they're not enforced then

3390.799 --> 3396.44
it's just it just people agree on it

3393.48 --> 3398.88
until somebody doesn't and then they'll

3396.44 --> 3400.799
just like kill everybody and what are

3398.88 --> 3402.599
you going to do then nothing maybe

3400.799 --> 3405.72
defend yourself well it's going to be

3402.599 --> 3407.4
hard if you defend yourself and there's

3405.72 --> 3412.1189999999997
a group just bigger than you that's

3407.4 --> 3412.119
storming you and [Â __Â ] it's totally

3413.88 --> 3417.7200000000003
idiotic

3415.96 --> 3421.68
like the best you could do is just have

3417.72 --> 3423.9599999999996
a very small government small but it

3421.68 --> 3425.9199999999996
still has to be there and you're still

3423.96 --> 3428.92
going to have to have some taxes and

3425.92 --> 3431.96
then you can have a relatively

3428.92 --> 3434.799
self-sufficient life and all

3431.96 --> 3438.96
that right big government is not good

3434.799 --> 3441.599
for anything except like draining

3438.96 --> 3445.2
people and attracting

3441.599 --> 3449.76
scammers but like no government at all

3445.2 --> 3449.7599999999998
it's just idiotic like it doesn't

3462.88 --> 3467.359
work people believe in the globe is

3465.72 --> 3469.24
because they don't want to believe that

3467.359 --> 3472.359
mainstream science can be

3469.24 --> 3475.319
wrong maybe clearly maybe it is like the

3472.359 --> 3476.0389999999998
fear of stepping outside of

3475.319 --> 3479.24
the

3476.039 --> 3483.119
norm it's it's certainly a fear with

3479.24 --> 3483.1189999999997
certain people a lot of

3486.72 --> 3492.319
them right but those people are not

3490.319 --> 3496.4
curious in

3492.319 --> 3499.599
nature they just want to hide in a

3496.4 --> 3501.64
group so they don't really care about it

3499.599 --> 3502.52
either way they just want to side with

3501.64 --> 3506.64
the

3502.52 --> 3510.88
winner right those people don't matter

3506.64 --> 3510.8799999999997
at all because they don't really

3511.359 --> 3516.359
care like if things really shifted

3514.44 --> 3518.76
around and it's not probably not going

3516.359 --> 3520.839
to then those same people would suddenly

3518.76 --> 3524.3590000000004
like no we were always flat earthers yes

3520.839 --> 3526.2
of course because they don't really care

3524.359 --> 3532.5589999999997

3564.0 --> 3568.559
to ignore it and is like oh no no I'm

3566.16 --> 3570.359
going to be outraged here then get ready

3568.559 --> 3574.6400000000003
to get

3570.359 --> 3578.2
banned right Gavin B up to

3574.64 --> 3581.72
you you're here to be triggered I'll

3578.2 --> 3581.72
I'll gladly kick you

3584.76 --> 3588.3790000000004
[Music]

3593.64 --> 3596.64
out

3607.599 --> 3613.039
what is England musks endgame who the

3610.16 --> 3613.0389999999998
hell knows

3623.559 --> 3626.559
man

3635.68 --> 3641.96
I don't know I think Elon Musk just

3637.48 --> 3645.039
mostly just wants to be like a a

3641.96 --> 3647.96
Cornerstone technocrat that like oh

3645.039 --> 3650.28
everybody uses my tech stuff he just

3647.96 --> 3653.44
want his stuff to be standardized and

3650.28 --> 3655.1600000000003
then make a lot of money doing it so

3653.44 --> 3657.7200000000003
that that's what I feel about about him

3655.16 --> 3660.0
I don't know exactly where I don't even

3657.72 --> 3661.7599999999998
know if he has like a long-term deeper

3660.0 --> 3664.57
plan with it too

3661.76 --> 3667.889
much I don't

3664.57 --> 3667.889
[Music]

3683.44 --> 3686.44
know

3703.559 --> 3710.48
man for what though

3706.839 --> 3713.0
Clary I mean he is a front man for his

3710.48 --> 3715.119
team I mean he is not the guy that's

3713.0 --> 3718.319
doing everything he's just the face he's

3715.119 --> 3718.319
the face of the company

3718.799 --> 3725.599
and like he doesn't make up all the

3723.119 --> 3728.359
ideas he has a lot of people that are

3725.599 --> 3728.3590000000004
like his think

3740.279 --> 3745.359
tank or he used to maybe he like

3743.119 --> 3747.7200000000003
replaced it all with AI or something I

3745.359 --> 3750.7599999999998
don't even know exactly what he is doing

3747.72 --> 3750.7599999999998
in that

3751.52 --> 3756.72
regard geospatial technology

3773.359 --> 3776.359
okay

3803.319 --> 3806.7599999999998
slightly better that's

3833.279 --> 3836.279
good

3836.64 --> 3840.839
all right anyway I hope you guys are

3838.279 --> 3840.839
enjoying the

3845.63 --> 3848.82

3851.119 --> 3855.48
show man I tried to like download some

3853.96 --> 3857.88
game

3855.48 --> 3859.96
yesterday it looked really interesting

3857.88 --> 3863.2000000000003
with interesting music and then it turns

3859.96 --> 3865.48
out oh you need Windows 10

3863.2 --> 3867.839
ah

3865.48 --> 3867.839
what a

3884.119 --> 3888.7200000000003
bummer

3886.079 --> 3891.6800000000003
sa join all the breakdowns of the

3888.72 --> 3895.279
mainstream videos yeah no I like it when

3891.68 --> 3899.0
like Nathan reviews like

3895.279 --> 3899.0
saine Hassen Felder or

3902.0 --> 3908.16
something like those are interesting

3904.599 --> 3911.1600000000003
breakdowns and yeah I I liked it when I

3908.16 --> 3914.2
was part of that I don't like it when

3911.16 --> 3917.48
they just go after really gross anti

3914.2 --> 3920.0
flat earthers though I do not like that

3917.48 --> 3920.0
it's very

3921.039 --> 3926.079
annoying like Logan Paul

3930.079 --> 3933.8390000000004
why petol

3934.92 --> 3940.079
guy

3937.079 --> 3940.079
what

3942.52 --> 3945.57
[Music]

3950.72 --> 3956.0789999999997
that I don't know who that is

3958.56 --> 3966.66
[Music]

3983.0 --> 3986.0
what

4008.039 --> 4013.48
merging Technologies like lar allow us

4010.48 --> 4014.68
to create a realtime model of our world

4013.48 --> 4018.48
yeah that would would be very

4014.68 --> 4018.48
interesting to actually

4018.559 --> 4024.7200000000003
see some of some of that what you're

4021.2 --> 4024.72
talking about clear but

4025.68 --> 4033.16
uh because why yeah maybe lar could help

4029.599 --> 4035.799
us to like give us the

4033.16 --> 4038.0789999999997
layout of the Equator right because

4035.799 --> 4039.599
there's still that mystery like how is

4038.079 --> 4043.079
the

4039.599 --> 4045.4
equator is it a circle like this Earths

4043.079 --> 4047.48
think it is or is it a straight line or

4045.4 --> 4050.079
or an arc or something like what is it

4047.48 --> 4052.68
how is the orientation of everything

4050.079 --> 4055.6800000000003
well if there's a possibility of a full

4052.68 --> 4057.0
scan of the whole thing in one go that

4055.68 --> 4060.5989999999997
could really

4057.0 --> 4060.599
help clear that

4072.92 --> 4075.92
up

4087.2 --> 4095.3999999999996
hey Steven Jarvis okay arguing with him

4091.599 --> 4095.4
yeah I'm sure he is about

4102.64 --> 4107.4400000000005
what oh is a a maholic yeah well a lot

4106.359 --> 4109.92
of them

4107.44 --> 4112.5199999999995
are yeah as soon as you think that math

4109.92 --> 4114.839
is reality then all this space nonsense

4112.52 --> 4117.839000000001
also becomes reality if it's just if

4114.839 --> 4119.92
there's a math for it it must be real

4117.839 --> 4122.92
yeah there a lot of nonsense math for a

4119.92 --> 4122.92
lot of nonsense Globe

4132.799 --> 4142.51
claims

4134.38 --> 4142.51
[Music]

4147.239 --> 4154.3589999999995
eat and some oh yeah whatever I mean

4150.319 --> 4154.359
it's not much of a discussion

4162.719 --> 4168.199
though

4165.679 --> 4170.56
but I mean to be fair it is we're living

4168.199 --> 4173.678999999999
in a situation that is really much more

4170.56 --> 4175.52
complicated than we've been told

4173.679 --> 4177.1990000000005
concerning like the sun and its

4175.52 --> 4178.759
influence and the light from the

4177.199 --> 4181.48
celestials I

4178.759 --> 4186.52
mean there's mechanics behind that that

4181.48 --> 4186.5199999999995
we literally like don't fully

4186.56 --> 4191.96
understand like the knowledge we have

4189.319 --> 4193.759
about light really like that's been

4191.96 --> 4197.04
worked out in engineering and all that

4193.759 --> 4198.719
that's all based on man-made

4197.04 --> 4202.08
lights

4198.719 --> 4205.159
yeah so there's

4202.08 --> 4208.08
just there's just

4205.159 --> 4210.159
assumptions about the celestial lights

4208.08 --> 4212.4
that they are that and that that's works

4210.159 --> 4215.12
just like man-made light and it's just

4212.4 --> 4215.12
always being

4222.64 --> 4225.64
assumed

4233.6 --> 4239.56
right but it's just like how can you

4235.84 --> 4242.52
even regard the sunlight when it's kind

4239.56 --> 4245.0
of obvious that it doesn't have a source

4242.52 --> 4247.400000000001
point of

4245.0 --> 4248.84
origination so could you think of it

4247.4 --> 4250.36
more like

4248.84 --> 4254.360000000001
a

4250.36 --> 4257.759999999999
microwave thing it's like it's just

4254.36 --> 4260.28
there manifesting just just heating it

4257.76 --> 4265.360000000001
up whatever it

4260.28 --> 4268.719
touches is it more like a a microwave

4265.36 --> 4268.719
thing like a

4272.199 --> 4279.0
field it's so

4274.88 --> 4281.56
weird and yeah I lack the concentration

4279.0 --> 4285.56
right now to really get deeper into that

4281.56 --> 4285.56
it's always been very complicated

4285.679 --> 4289.36
yeah sunlight seems different from

4287.159 --> 4293.239
ordinary light because it

4289.36 --> 4295.759999999999
is ordinary light doesn't create

4293.239 --> 4298.199
rainbows that are

4295.76 --> 4300.08
Prismatic and that move with you

4298.199 --> 4302.919999999999
sunlight

4300.08 --> 4307.0
does it's a completely different class

4302.92 --> 4310.719
of light and it's not at rested it's not

4307.0 --> 4313.0
address in physics it just isn't I mean

4310.719 --> 4316.0
it's like oh yeah we got the output the

4313.0 --> 4320.0
Spectrum of what is absorbed at Ground

4316.0 --> 4323.08
they got that part but they're not like

4320.0 --> 4324.88
even saying or suggesting that it might

4323.08 --> 4330.28
be a light of a completely different

4324.88 --> 4330.28
nature entirely which it is

4331.48 --> 4338.4
obviously how many kinds of light there

4333.92 --> 4338.4
are oh wow that's quite a

4342.48 --> 4347.159
mission

4344.199 --> 4351.5599999999995
yeah I know what work gy bear but that's

4347.159 --> 4351.5599999999995
arguably like the daylight right the

4352.12 --> 4358.12
daylight was created first and then the

4354.88 --> 4359.96
sun was placed alongside the stars and

4358.12 --> 4363.88
the

4359.96 --> 4363.88
planet but yeah light was

4368.4 --> 4375.44
first sun is just an energy source

4372.44 --> 4375.44
manifest

4375.639 --> 4382.36
no now that's

4379.639 --> 4384.2390000000005
that's that's already like a physical

4382.36 --> 4388.88
assumption that it's an assumption that

4384.239 --> 4388.879999999999
it's a thing that is actually physically

4389.44 --> 4395.4
there I mean sure there's

4392.44 --> 4397.839999999999
energy but the sun is not the source

4395.4 --> 4400.679
like what we see as the sun is like an

4397.84 --> 4405.360000000001
apparition a side

4400.679 --> 4405.36
effect of the angular manifesting

4405.92 --> 4409.92
light like it's not a

4410.0 --> 4416.679
source whatever causes this sun

4414.159 --> 4419.879999999999
Apparition and the energy and the light

4416.679 --> 4422.4800000000005
coming over here being absorbed like we

4419.88 --> 4424.92
don't know what is causing that the

4422.48 --> 4427.718999999999
closest I could imagine is

4424.92 --> 4429.88
like like we're in a microwave and it

4427.719 --> 4431.679
just like the microwave gives a very

4429.88 --> 4435.92
specific

4431.679 --> 4438.12
pattern of energy influx that you would

4435.92 --> 4440.0
see like there's a sun manifesting or

4438.12 --> 4442.44
something right like

4440.0 --> 4445.0
that angular manifesting light is

4442.44 --> 4447.759999999999
interesting yeah I know I I literally

4445.0 --> 4447.76
coined the

4449.0 --> 4453.679
term I never thought of it as much but

4451.44 --> 4456.719
it is kind of like yeah it is a term

4453.679 --> 4461.8
that I coined angular manifesting

4456.719 --> 4464.56
light yeah sun and all the celestials

4461.8 --> 4467.4400000000005
are angular

4464.56 --> 4472.120000000001
manifesting

4467.44 --> 4472.12
light that is non-local

4472.88 --> 4478.6
holographic so it's not really there it

4475.32 --> 4482.08
moves with you so every person has a

4478.6 --> 4484.76
unique array of celestial light

4482.08 --> 4487.5199999999995
influences in their

4484.76 --> 4491.84
surrounding nobody sees the

4487.52 --> 4493.4400000000005
same light patterns nobody not it's

4491.84 --> 4495.400000000001
always slightly different because you're

4493.44 --> 4497.159
in a different position as

4495.4 --> 4499.32
you're

4497.159 --> 4501.679
observing the

4499.32 --> 4503.92
celestials and the celestials may even

4501.679 --> 4505.84
have a different manifestation pattern

4503.92 --> 4508.08
because of that as I explained earlier

4505.84 --> 4510.08
like yeah you can see corpuscular Rays

4508.08 --> 4512.76
maybe through the clouds from one

4510.08 --> 4516.48
position and then somebody else on a

4512.76 --> 4519.360000000001
mountain is looking at you with

4516.48 --> 4522.44
binoculars and they won't see those

4519.36 --> 4524.28
corpuscular rays in front of your feet

4522.44 --> 4526.48
from their f vage point because from

4524.28 --> 4529.4
their vantage point the sun isn't in the

4526.48 --> 4531.799999999999
correct position to cast those

4529.4 --> 4534.599999999999
crepuscular

4531.8 --> 4537.2390000000005
Rays yeah angular manifestation

4534.6 --> 4537.2390000000005
non-local

4540.08 --> 4544.719
hologram what then what does angular

4542.44 --> 4547.28
manifestation means it means that

4544.719 --> 4547.28
something

4547.4 --> 4554.239
manifests with a specific

4550.88 --> 4557.639
angle it comes in angular so it's

4554.239 --> 4559.759999999999
like this angle it just comes in it just

4557.639 --> 4562.679
doesn't come from anywhere it just

4559.76 --> 4565.2390000000005
manifests it's not o there's a thing

4562.679 --> 4569.1990000000005
there it shines and that's why it's the

4565.239 --> 4572.36
angle no there's nothing there it just

4569.199 --> 4575.159
manifests out of nothing arguably I mean

4572.36 --> 4579.799999999999
the energy must come from somewhere but

4575.159 --> 4584.4
how we don't know it's not coming from a

4579.8 --> 4588.8
lamp or a giant ball of gas or anything

4584.4 --> 4588.799999999999
so that's why I call it angular

4598.88 --> 4603.36
manifestation there could be a different

4601.28 --> 4607.08
light yeah well there could be all kinds

4603.36 --> 4607.08
of things we don't get to see it

4612.08 --> 4615.92
though

4614.199 --> 4619.239
How can there be nothing and something

4615.92 --> 4622.679
at the same time there is something it's

4619.239 --> 4626.759999999999
just specific to The

4622.679 --> 4630.56
Observer and I don't know

4626.76 --> 4630.56
why so very

4638.4 --> 4643.5199999999995
mysterious right there is something it's

4641.0 --> 4646.239
just not a thing

4643.52 --> 4648.96
that cast a light like a

4646.239 --> 4650.839999999999
lamp but there's something it's just not

4648.96 --> 4653.6
a that it's not

4650.84 --> 4655.4400000000005
that and whatever it is it results in

4653.6 --> 4656.39
this angular manifestation of the

4655.44 --> 4665.71
celestial

to make people think or

4790.84 --> 4794.84
wonder yeah

4798.42 --> 4802.05
[Music]

4806.43 --> 4810.009
[Music]

4821.76 --> 4824.76
yeah

4831.94 --> 4837.5199999999995
[Music]

4875.84 --> 4881.12
like to see Brian Co explain it well

4877.76 --> 4884.639
Brian's not on with me in that he has

4881.12 --> 4884.639
his own ideas

4890.8 --> 4896.04
like all at fed all of them like do

4893.719 --> 4900.8
realize that none of them are actually

4896.04 --> 4904.08
like really on board with me there at

4900.8 --> 4906.84
all so this is not my problem though I'm

4904.08 --> 4908.72
just I don't need them to be on board

4906.84 --> 4911.639
with

4908.72 --> 4914.639
[Music]

4911.639 --> 4914.639
it

4914.9 --> 4918.12
[Music]

4942.08 --> 4947.36
okay thanks for that out

4944.36 --> 4947.36
condo

4948.679 --> 4954.6
true and this realization about the

4952.04 --> 4958.12
celestials I do consider that one of my

4954.6 --> 4961.4400000000005
more genius insights so not that I'm

4958.12 --> 4965.28
always a genius with everything but this

4961.44 --> 4969.599999999999
one was like that was a real

4965.28 --> 4969.599999999999
killer when I started to see

4971.56 --> 4975.52
that

4973.61 --> 4977.88
[Music]

4975.52 --> 4980.4400000000005
and it also was accompanied by the

4977.88 --> 4983.0
psychological realization of physicality

4980.44 --> 4983.0
assumption

4983.48 --> 4989.0
bias what realization the title duper

4987.28 --> 4992.32
what we've been talking about in the

4989.0 --> 4992.32
last 15

5001.48 --> 5004.48
minutes

5005.18 --> 5013.899
[Music]

5023.65 --> 5026.929999999999
[Music]

5031.48 --> 5036.718999999999
for

5034.18 --> 5038.08
[Music]

5036.719 --> 5040.32
all right

5038.08 --> 5044.199
anyway hope you

5040.32 --> 5046.32
guys can support me a little bit today

5044.199 --> 5049.759999999999
maybe not I mean I'll survive I'm not

5046.32 --> 5049.759999999999
really eating all that much

5053.6 --> 5060.639
anyway maybe I'll

5056.32 --> 5060.639
just kind of fast for the

5060.92 --> 5067.76
next three

5063.199 --> 5067.759999999999
the six days I don't

5078.04 --> 5086.76
[Music]

5083.8 --> 5088.04
know without getting out of the Dome how

5086.76 --> 5091.360000000001
would you know it's

5088.04 --> 5094.44
true how would you know what is

5091.36 --> 5097.5199999999995
true that the celestial lights we see

5094.44 --> 5099.96
are non-local holographic angular

5097.52 --> 5104.88
manifestations we don't need to get out

5099.96 --> 5104.88
of the dome which might not be a

5105.04 --> 5111.199
dome there might not be any outside of

5108.639 --> 5113.28
the container duper you realize that

5111.199 --> 5116.5199999999995
there simply may not be any more

5113.28 --> 5120.159
available space in physical existence

5116.52 --> 5124.159000000001
Beyond The Realm that we are

5120.159 --> 5127.638999999999
in yeah

5124.159 --> 5130.719
and despite well wherever you want to be

5127.639 --> 5133.32
it doesn't take away the fact

5130.719 --> 5135.44
that the celestial non local holographic

5133.32 --> 5139.08
angular manifestations are just there

5135.44 --> 5141.08
doing what they do and yeah you go up

5139.08 --> 5143.96
Stars

5141.08 --> 5145.5599999999995
disappear try to follow the moon it's

5143.96 --> 5148.28
going to bend away it's going to keep

5145.56 --> 5150.639
its distance no matter what and same

5148.28 --> 5154.28
with the sun arguably although I haven't

5150.639 --> 5156.4800000000005
seen elaborate tests nobody's really

5154.28 --> 5158.92
done an Icarus test to this day which is

5156.48 --> 5164.36
kind of a bummer because that would

5158.92 --> 5164.36
really help me figure out

5168.119 --> 5173.839999999999
more right because if there's any form

5171.0 --> 5175.88
of angular size increase in the sun's

5173.84 --> 5178.719
observation as you go up if you like

5175.88 --> 5179.400000000001
approach it that would change things

5178.719 --> 5183.28
that

5179.4 --> 5185.5199999999995
would potentially nullify

5183.28 --> 5185.5199999999995
my

5186.199 --> 5192.4
theory the point is is that there's none

5189.639 --> 5195.6
no evidence whatsoever of

5192.4 --> 5197.638999999999
that celestials always seem to keep

5195.6 --> 5202.08
their apparent distance and so they

5197.639 --> 5205.32
can't be physical objects emanating

5202.08 --> 5208.719
light moving outside of the realm is not

5205.32 --> 5208.719
going to change those

5211.199 --> 5214.199
facts

5215.28 --> 5220.239
a small scale test how the hell would I

5217.719 --> 5221.639
do that duper I don't know how to create

5220.239 --> 5225.718999999999
non-local

5221.639 --> 5225.719
Holograms how the hell would I do

5228.92 --> 5234.52
that maybe ask NASA I'm sure they're

5232.0 --> 5234.52
working on

5236.239 --> 5242.959999999999
it but we can see the sun under the

5239.0 --> 5245.199
clouds No you can't see it under

5242.96 --> 5247.76
anything it's an angular manifestation

5245.199 --> 5250.638999999999
doesn't have a position under the under

5247.76 --> 5255.08
the clouds above the CLS behind the

5250.639 --> 5258.159000000001
clouds in front of the clouds it isn't

5255.08 --> 5261.36
anywhere it isn't

5258.159 --> 5265.199
anywhere it doesn't have a position it

5261.36 --> 5265.199
just appears like that

5265.84 --> 5271.28
apparent

5268.32 --> 5273.719
yeah it's a non-local hologram it will

5271.28 --> 5277.159
appear where wherever it will appear

5273.719 --> 5277.159
it's not actually

5280.17 --> 5284.8
[Music]

5282.0 --> 5288.32
there not physically it's not physically

5284.8 --> 5290.719
in that location in ukian space that you

5288.32 --> 5293.199
go to that location and then it's there

5290.719 --> 5295.88
really big or whatever no it isn't

5293.199 --> 5299.879999999999
anywhere wherever it may appear to be

5295.88 --> 5299.88
it's not actually literally

5301.04 --> 5305.199
there

5303.119 --> 5310.4
we need an instrument that can detect

5305.199 --> 5310.4
what this why what how would you do

5313.66 --> 5321.32
[Music]

5318.119 --> 5324.04
that no no that doesn't help at all

5321.32 --> 5326.119
duper you're making massive

5324.04 --> 5328.56
presuppositions hey you want to back

5326.119 --> 5330.32
engineer something to create the same

5328.56 --> 5332.6
effect as the celestial nonlocal

5330.32 --> 5336.799999999999
holographic angular manifestation

5332.6 --> 5336.8
and some model by all

5339.199 --> 5344.96
means I don't really have any Ambitions

5341.92 --> 5348.56
to try to create a model to mimic it

5344.96 --> 5348.56
like I don't even know where to

5356.199 --> 5363.919999999999
start Cham no I'm not I don't care about

5359.719 --> 5363.92
some short name tomonoid

5368.96 --> 5375.28
it shouldn't be shorter it should be

5371.48 --> 5378.28
long because it's something really weird

5375.28 --> 5381.5599999999995
it's something very unique and

5378.28 --> 5382.92
unusual and mindboggling it should be a

5381.56 --> 5387.0
long

5382.92 --> 5389.2390000000005
title because otherwise people might get

5387.0 --> 5392.199
an idea and like oversimplify it in

5389.239 --> 5394.839999999999
their mind and then get it wrong they

5392.199 --> 5398.5599999999995
need to know it is something that is

5394.84 --> 5402.4800000000005
quite mysterious and unique like really

5398.56 --> 5406.0
unique physics unique like you don't

5402.48 --> 5408.28
know even how to tackle this yeah that

5406.0 --> 5410.6
level of unique it's something really

5408.28 --> 5410.599999999999
really

5411.0 --> 5418.0
unique anything shorter it would just

5414.4 --> 5420.92
make people just think that oh it's not

5418.0 --> 5422.92
understand it and then just like do the

5420.92 --> 5424.8
same thing over again

5422.92 --> 5428.08
go with the physicality assumption bias

5424.8 --> 5430.88
they would misunderstand it it has to be

5428.08 --> 5434.199
long because it's really complicated and

5430.88 --> 5438.119
we don't know how we don't know what it

5434.199 --> 5441.28
is how it works why it works that way so

5438.119 --> 5441.28
it should be very

5443.719 --> 5448.28
long nonlocal R done it if it's

5446.52 --> 5451.96
Celestial no it is non local it's

5448.28 --> 5453.92
nonlocal holographic like a hologram

5451.96 --> 5455.719
like a hologram that you would create

5453.92 --> 5458.88
with light right you see it in front of

5455.719 --> 5460.119
you some Crystal thing or whatever

5458.88 --> 5462.400000000001
pyramid

5460.119 --> 5465.759999999999
thing but the thing is that those

5462.4 --> 5467.96
Holograms are local which means that you

5465.76 --> 5470.719
walk up to that thing in which the

5467.96 --> 5474.8
Hologram is created and it becomes

5470.719 --> 5478.04
bigger it its appearance has an actual

5474.8 --> 5480.360000000001
location that when you approach the

5478.04 --> 5483.639
angular size become bigger becomes

5480.36 --> 5486.159
bigger so it's not non-local it's a

5483.639 --> 5488.56
local hologram it's something that

5486.159 --> 5492.119
appears to be there you go up to it it

5488.56 --> 5495.119000000001
it becomes bigger to you yeah the

5492.119 --> 5501.239
celestial lights specifically don't do

5495.119 --> 5504.92
that and we or I don't know how the hell

5501.239 --> 5508.159
like yeah there something we see we

5504.92 --> 5510.76
can't recreate that yeah it's that

5508.159 --> 5513.5199999999995
simple you can't recreate

5510.76 --> 5515.360000000001
it

5513.52 --> 5518.360000000001
it's one of those things you need to get

5515.36 --> 5521.199
over yeah you need to get over the

5518.36 --> 5522.5599999999995
control freakishness that oh you have to

5521.199 --> 5526.119
understand everything you see in your

5522.56 --> 5528.4800000000005
life yeah well guess what you don't you

5526.119 --> 5530.44
can delute yourself into thinking you

5528.48 --> 5532.599999999999
can understand everything that you see

5530.44 --> 5534.4
though all you have to do is lie about

5532.6 --> 5537.76
it yeah the

5534.4 --> 5540.719
heliocentric model is very good for that

5537.76 --> 5542.4400000000005
sort of thing it will tell you exactly

5540.719 --> 5545.119
what everything is you see it's

5542.44 --> 5547.159
completely wrong but at least it will

5545.119 --> 5549.92
have a claim like you can know

5547.159 --> 5549.92
everything that you're

5553.1 --> 5557.280000000001
[Music]

5554.84 --> 5564.159000000001
seeing

5557.28 --> 5564.159
no a Holo projected from no just

5570.639 --> 5573.639
no

5582.159 --> 5586.239
can you create a sun that gets bigger

5584.08 --> 5588.48
when it goes

5586.239 --> 5590.48
away

5588.48 --> 5594.199
what it

5590.48 --> 5597.4
doesn't get bigger when it goes away and

5594.199 --> 5599.638999999999
it doesn't go away it doesn't have a

5597.4 --> 5601.28
position over Earth in order for you to

5599.639 --> 5603.88
make the claim that it goes away it

5601.28 --> 5605.84
doesn't have any position you could

5603.88 --> 5609.96
presuppose that it have a position Like

5605.84 --> 5611.8
A Flat Earth discer and be wrong you

5609.96 --> 5614.28
could do that

5611.8 --> 5616.84
duper give into your physicality

5614.28 --> 5616.84
assumption

5619.4 --> 5623.719
bias if you can't do

5621.59 --> 5627.2390000000005
[Music]

5623.719 --> 5630.08
it yeah why it appears that the sun

5627.239 --> 5632.239
becomes bigger at the Horizon is not

5630.08 --> 5634.8
because it's moving away or doing

5632.239 --> 5637.159
anything it's just whatever you're

5634.8 --> 5640.04
seeing that manifestation is going

5637.159 --> 5641.799999999999
through thicker air and so you could

5640.04 --> 5645.0
argue there's a lensing

5641.8 --> 5647.0
effect of the angular manifestation that

5645.0 --> 5649.6
is nonlocal it doesn't have an actual

5647.0 --> 5651.88
position but the angular manifestation

5649.6 --> 5655.719
does go through thicker air so that

5651.88 --> 5657.52
perhaps might magnify the apparent on

5655.719 --> 5660.88
local

5657.52 --> 5662.040000000001
manifestation that's it it's as far as

5660.88 --> 5666.719
you can take it

5662.04 --> 5668.639
CU you can't check test VAR manipulate

5666.719 --> 5671.52
anything about

5668.639 --> 5674.52
it because we don't know what the sun is

5671.52 --> 5674.52
in order to do

5675.239 --> 5680.599999999999
that you could only compare it to light

5678.48 --> 5682.36
from an object and then see like oh yeah

5680.6 --> 5685.719
would you do that oh yeah it might lens

5682.36 --> 5689.239
a bit but it's not

5685.719 --> 5694.04
that the sun isn't an

5689.239 --> 5694.04
object so it's all just

5708.94 --> 5712.589999999999
[Music]

5720.4 --> 5723.4
speculation

5724.76 --> 5729.0
well mood working going to no doubt I

5730.32 --> 5735.84
mean like I've speculated quite wildly

5733.4 --> 5737.759999999999
about what it is why is it nonlocal like

5735.84 --> 5740.679
yeah well maybe the celestials are

5737.76 --> 5742.280000000001
actually local in the fourth dimension

5740.679 --> 5745.6
but in the third dimension they just

5742.28 --> 5747.639
stay a backdrop effect that follows you

5745.6 --> 5749.2390000000005
around I mean that logically kind of

5747.639 --> 5752.719
makes sense to

5749.239 --> 5757.36
me just expanded dimension

5752.719 --> 5757.36
thinking but I mean yeah you can't prove

5758.0 --> 5763.52
it you might technically be able to

5760.88 --> 5766.2390000000005
calculate it with math but I mean what's

5763.52 --> 5766.2390000000005
the point of it

5771.32 --> 5777.799999999999
all and the fact it remains is we don't

5775.08 --> 5780.719
know and we don't know how to recreate

5777.8 --> 5784.2390000000005
any of it I don't know maybe somebody

5780.719 --> 5784.2390000000005
out there is working on it who

5791.84 --> 5795.529
[Music]

5810.28 --> 5813.28
knows

5843.97 --> 5850.39
[Music]

5870.199 --> 5873.199
for

5895.04 --> 5902.92
right anyway yeah that was interesting

5898.4 --> 5906.0
subject typical or Winan staple

5902.92 --> 5908.0
subject but unfortunately it does always

5906.0 --> 5911.28
eventually amount to like yeah we just

5908.0 --> 5914.44
don't know so can't really do anything

5911.28 --> 5918.36
about that could just try to explain it

5914.44 --> 5920.759999999999
more clearly what I've observed and

5918.36 --> 5920.759999999999
figured

5921.08 --> 5926.92
out yeah we know duper you don't have to

5924.56 --> 5926.92
say

5928.96 --> 5933.4
that again I we

5936.88 --> 5941.159000000001
know I've seen the sunset

5943.26 --> 5947.780000000001

for

6054.56 --> 6060.599
optical illusion really changing angular

6057.28 --> 6060.599
size yeah do

6060.88 --> 6066.56
anoid I mean technically yeah that is

6069.159 --> 6076.4
true I think I'm not entirely

6073.159 --> 6076.4
sure but I

6076.679 --> 6082.599
mean there is like illusions of the eye

6080.48 --> 6084.04
like how the ey represents things so

6082.599 --> 6086.400000000001
that does

6084.04 --> 6088.679
exist it might have something to do with

6086.4 --> 6088.679
it

6089.32 --> 6092.32
but

6109.84 --> 6112.84
whatever

6139.76 --> 6142.76
for

6164.84 --> 6170.4800000000005
what like yours yeah it's all nonsense

6168.44 --> 6172.879999999999
the M this but yeah they have their own

6170.48 --> 6174.199
answer answers the things it's funny

6172.88 --> 6178.639
though that they're saying like yeah the

6174.199 --> 6178.638999999999
angular size doesn't change

6180.639 --> 6184.84
H light your no they

6185.199 --> 6190.839999999999
don't and the whole term is complete

6187.8 --> 6194.4400000000005
nonsense because light doesn't have a

6190.84 --> 6197.0
speed so light isn't going to take a

6194.44 --> 6199.239
year to travel any distance it's

6197.0 --> 6202.679
complete nonsense it's all science

6199.239 --> 6202.678999999999
fiction mumbo jumbo

6229.679 --> 6232.679
for

6234.0 --> 6237.68
you yeah I am the citation get the [Â __Â ]

6236.52 --> 6240.89
out of here

6237.68 --> 6240.89
[Music]

6243.56 --> 6246.749000000001
[Music]

6247.679 --> 6253.96
[Â __Â ] yeah there's no measured speed

6250.159 --> 6256.04
of light at all it's presupposed yeah

6253.96 --> 6258.52
the speed of light is just

6256.04 --> 6261.5199999999995
presupposed based on the Assumption of

6258.52 --> 6264.080000000001
like oh there's all this Spectrum

6261.52 --> 6266.92
alteration internally and oh that must

6264.08 --> 6269.48
be because the speed of it is changing

6266.92 --> 6272.1990000000005
yeah but they never actually measured

6269.48 --> 6276.08
the speed they only just presuppose it

6272.199 --> 6276.08
and that's how it all is put

6287.64 --> 6292.56
[Music]

6289.56 --> 6292.56
together

6297.44 --> 6303.239
wait

6299.599 --> 6306.599
what why didn't

6303.239 --> 6306.598999999999
say that's

6319.48 --> 6322.48
weird

6328.679 --> 6336.0
right [Â __Â ] this is weird like it's not

6332.92 --> 6336.0
showing this

6344.119 --> 6347.119
stuff

6349.239 --> 6357.638999999999
see huh huh that's

6353.44 --> 6360.0
odd so Google Chrome doesn't show the

6357.639 --> 6362.159000000001
moderator

6360.0 --> 6366.48
texts like

6362.159 --> 6366.48
hidden it doesn't show that that's

6369.93 --> 6372.969
[Music]

6379.4 --> 6382.4
weird

6386.04 --> 6390.599
who else says light has no speed uh

6388.92 --> 6395.159
Ryan's

6390.599 --> 6395.159000000001
logic has done some videos about

6403.11 --> 6410.4
[Music]

6407.679 --> 6414.04
that I mean it's been widely discussed

6410.4 --> 6416.5599999999995
on fed like a year ago or something and

6414.04 --> 6419.32
more but yeah I don't really want to get

6416.56 --> 6422.4400000000005
into it I definitely don't want to try

6419.32 --> 6424.799999999999
to counter a bunch of gamas then insist

6422.44 --> 6425.839999999999
on it because it's so important to them

6424.8 --> 6428.8
because

6425.84 --> 6430.719
like a quarter of all science fiction

6428.8 --> 6432.599
works is based on the nonsense

6430.719 --> 6436.52
Assumption of a speed of

6432.599 --> 6439.08
light like it's so widely manifested

6436.52 --> 6441.040000000001
unbelievably wide so yeah of course

6439.08 --> 6442.48
people don't like to hear hey speed

6441.04 --> 6445.08
doesn't actually light doesn't actually

6442.48 --> 6447.5199999999995
have a speed they don't like to hear

6445.08 --> 6449.76
that cuz then nothing works in their

6948.599 --> 6951.599
e

6978.52 --> 6981.52
e

7007.599 --> 7011.4800000000005
and I'm back

7020.599 --> 7026.599
oh we's talking the pondering pengs

7024.36 --> 7030.48
okay

7026.599 --> 7030.4800000000005
uh nobody

7031.28 --> 7036.5199999999995
yeah with the same conclusion what are

7033.92 --> 7036.52
you talking

7036.679 --> 7041.28
about experiments really what's the

7039.8 --> 7043.599
independent variable what are you

7041.28 --> 7043.599
talking

7046.84 --> 7051.28
about this is

7049.079 --> 7054.36
[Â __Â ] yeah there's no measured speed

7051.28 --> 7056.96
of light you can presuppose it you can

7054.36 --> 7059.639
do a bunch of tests and then claim that

7056.96 --> 7061.8
that proves the speed of light you don't

7059.639 --> 7061.8
it

7062.0 --> 7067.159
isn't there's no actual measured speed

7064.92 --> 7067.159
of

7067.28 --> 7071.4
light it's just presupposed

7076.44 --> 7081.079
post so by the way you're using the word

7079.199 --> 7083.0
experiment I'm pretty damn sure that you

7081.079 --> 7085.679
don't know what an experiment is nor

7083.0 --> 7085.679
what science

7092.0 --> 7099.52
is yeah you can do all the tests in the

7096.04 --> 7102.5199999999995
world it's not going to prove light has

7099.52 --> 7102.52
the speed it

7128.32 --> 7131.32
doesn't

7158.239 --> 7161.239
for

7168.52 --> 7172.599
all right passing the 2hour mark uh

7171.079 --> 7175.199
anything else otherwise I'm probably

7172.599 --> 7177.56
going to round out the show I

7175.199 --> 7181.159
mean

7177.56 --> 7182.719
already elaborated on the main subject

7181.159 --> 7184.4
anyway I don't really want to get into

7182.719 --> 7186.4
the speed of light nonsense it just

7184.4 --> 7188.5199999999995
gives me a

7186.4 --> 7189.96
headache especially if there's like

7188.52 --> 7193.2390000000005
multiple people people that are just

7189.96 --> 7193.2390000000005
going to keep whining on about

7197.199 --> 7202.719
it now you want to figure it out just go

7200.0 --> 7206.28
over to Brian's

7202.719 --> 7209.159
logic he's way more patient with that

7206.28 --> 7209.159
sort of thing than I

7218.159 --> 7224.199
am shut up them with a citation what

7222.32 --> 7227.04
shut them up with a citation what the

7224.199 --> 7227.04
[Â __Â ] are you talking

7230.079 --> 7237.679
about like why would that matter who the

7233.48 --> 7237.678999999999
[Â __Â ] would I why would I need to site

7245.679 --> 7251.84
anybody who am I supposed to be sting

7248.4 --> 7251.839999999999
like this doesn't make any

7278.04 --> 7283.239
sense

7280.44 --> 7284.839999999999
I could just frecking try but this is

7283.239 --> 7287.799999999999
pointless I don't even know why I'm

7284.84 --> 7287.8
entertaining any of

7290.78 --> 7296.3099999999995
[Music]

7305.0 --> 7308.0
you

7308.04 --> 7311.04
wow

7313.04 --> 7318.719
yeah there's just ridicule

7316.0 --> 7321.96
everywhere

7318.719 --> 7325.04
space.com yeah it's all because it's a

7321.96 --> 7327.92
vested interest in light having a speed

7325.04 --> 7327.92
it's part of their

7332.36 --> 7338.598999999999
system so it's not going to be out there

7335.44 --> 7340.598999999999
like but it's not been measured though

7338.599 --> 7344.52
yeah I mean you immediately get a bunch

7340.599 --> 7348.360000000001
of Einstein nonsense when you Google it

7344.52 --> 7348.360000000001
so it's really no

7355.159 --> 7361.44
point light doesn't propagate

7358.119 --> 7363.5199999999995
forever it gets absorbed but it's

7361.44 --> 7367.96
instantaneous it doesn't have

7363.52 --> 7370.96
a time interval

7367.96 --> 7370.96
between

7372.679 --> 7378.32
between where it starts manifesting to

7375.679 --> 7382.079
where it gets absorbed it's

7378.32 --> 7386.0
instantaneous speed is all

7382.079 --> 7386.0
theoretical it's just

7397.88 --> 7400.88
presupposed

7418.639 --> 7424.639
what cons of ideas

7421.8 --> 7427.88
oh oh so you're just all here to troll

7424.639 --> 7430.36
me okay I got I can fix

7427.88 --> 7434.32
that

7430.36 --> 7439.679
yeah get the [Â __Â ] out of

7434.32 --> 7439.679
here and you [Â __Â ] off too

7440.4 --> 7447.36

[Music]

7476.28 --> 7482.96
yeah I mean clearly the space Oh it's

7479.92 --> 7485.079
space it's a an endless vacuum and we're

7482.96 --> 7487.8
supposed to sit there right next to it

7485.079 --> 7490.5199999999995
with gas pressure that we're breathing I

7487.8 --> 7492.599
mean this is is it just comes down to

7490.52 --> 7495.92
all the

7492.599 --> 7498.92
same Globe nonsense and I don't like

7495.92 --> 7501.079
getting into that but it'll just Tri

7498.92 --> 7506.0
trigger all these [Â __Â ] fundies and

7501.079 --> 7506.0
I'm I'm very glad to be rid of

7552.32 --> 7557.84
all right I think I'm going to round out

7554.239 --> 7557.839999999999
I'm kind of running out of steam

7560.8 --> 7567.96
anyway unless anybody else has a request

7563.719 --> 7567.96
that doesn't involve supposed speed the

7577.599 --> 7580.599
light

7590.199 --> 7595.199
nope all right then thanks everyone for

7593.04 --> 7597.04
