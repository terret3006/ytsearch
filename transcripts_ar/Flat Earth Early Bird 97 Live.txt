4.04 --> 11.61
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

8.189 --> 17.72
early-bird number 97 I'm your host

11.61 --> 20.41
Arwen and today is something else

17.72 --> 24.04
it's

20.41 --> 26.46
so incredibly clear and so sunny and

24.04 --> 30.299999999999997
bright it's just an entirely different

26.46 --> 33.160000000000004
sensation like this you know I'm seeing

30.3 --> 37.03
planes flying over nothing is being left

33.16 --> 37.69
behind it's how it seems so check this

37.03 --> 42.239000000000004
out

37.69 --> 44.68
I went out for some groceries because

42.239 --> 47.82
everything seemed to come together and

44.68 --> 47.82
look at this

67.43 --> 70.48
and yeah

76.28 --> 83.72
a few good

78.29 --> 86.98
but yeah maybe yeah maybe almost a

83.72 --> 92.15
little bit overboard it's such a weird

86.98 --> 94.64
switch around from the last few days so

92.15 --> 97.18
I'm just gonna eat my dad's morning and

94.64 --> 102.41
just calm down

97.18 --> 105.11000000000001
don't let the mania take me over also

102.41 --> 106.61
yeah I managed to reach that 1100

105.11 --> 110.12
subscribers whoo-hoo

106.61 --> 114.17
and it's even only halfway month at the

110.12 --> 122.12
month so nice thank you all

114.17 --> 124.9
thanks all the new subscribers but yeah

122.12 --> 124.9
it's funny that

125.79 --> 131.19
just a combination of it all just gave

128.07 --> 133.95
me this incredible burst of strength and

131.19 --> 141.45
confidence in with it come some

133.95 --> 145.26
crazy-ass ideas it's weird like makes me

141.45 --> 147.63
want to do extreme things that I'm

145.26 --> 150.66
obviously not really gonna do because

147.63 --> 153.63
it'd be overboard but makes me want to

150.66 --> 157.74
do that and that is typically what mania

153.63 --> 162.63
does it's the exact opposite depression

157.74 --> 166.08
and you want to overdo everything so

162.63 --> 168.18
yeah no intro yet though yeah yesterday

166.08 --> 173.42000000000002
I came to this point where I was just

168.18 --> 173.42000000000002
sick of it all these unfinished things

174.23 --> 180.48
so I said okay I'm gonna do it all all

177.24 --> 183.35000000000002
of it it's all of it immediately guess

180.48 --> 188.60999999999999
maybe that was the start of the mania

183.35 --> 192.48
the damn breaking through and well I

188.61 --> 196.20000000000002
have installed a lot of things and I got

192.48 --> 198.92999999999998
back to Chris but song he made for my

196.2 --> 201.92999999999998
interest song and haven't gotten it yet

198.93 --> 204.78
but as soon as I do as soon as I get

201.93 --> 206.519
that mp3 I am gonna make an intro and

204.78 --> 209.88
maybe not even with a title screen

206.519 --> 214.23000000000002
because hey yeah I offered my audience

209.88 --> 217.23
the people out there now months ago yeah

214.23 --> 219.66
could somebody make a title screen

217.23 --> 222.04999999999998
that's kind of fitting an animated title

219.66 --> 224.94
screen and then I can do the intro well

222.05 --> 227.16000000000003
nobody really seems to have the time for

224.94 --> 229.98
that or whatever so I'm just gonna do it

227.16 --> 233.91
without or do something crappy and if

229.98 --> 237.06
you don't like that then maybe that

233.91 --> 241.04999999999998
dislike will drive you to actually do a

237.06 --> 243.66
better job instead of just not noticing

241.05 --> 247.29000000000002
there's nothing there and just not

243.66 --> 257.33
anything so that's gonna be what I'm

247.29 --> 261.81
gonna do I also notice some things

257.33 --> 264.45
really annoying actually not twice that

261.81 --> 266.94
yeah I've had these new gloves that were

264.45 --> 269.07
pretty damn cheap but really

266.94 --> 272.4
good-looking now and I found out where

269.07 --> 275.96999999999997
the Chiba is because apparently there's

272.4 --> 278.7
just the worst cheap-ass shoe polish in

275.97 --> 282.27000000000004
those gloves I've ever come across

278.7 --> 284.94
because yeah if I'm rubbing my eyes or

282.27 --> 287.90999999999997
what it whatever with him yeah I get

284.94 --> 289.89
these these very obvious black stains

287.91 --> 292.44
that makes no damn sense I didn't put

289.89 --> 296.84999999999997
anything on there but they rub off

292.44 --> 302.7
terribly so yeah sometimes apparently I

296.85 --> 306.0
go around half blackface and nobody even

302.7 --> 308.49
tells me today again I did groceries and

306.0 --> 310.95
at the very very last stop somebody said

308.49 --> 314.19
hey you got something black there oh

310.95 --> 316.38
thanks all the three other shops where

314.19 --> 318.68
people just didn't say anything thanks

316.38 --> 318.68
for that

319.65 --> 323.78
but anyway I guess that

323.889 --> 327.06
nothing cheap

328.02 --> 337.44
ya can ever be that good it's just rule

332.52 --> 339.9
of thumb and cheap is also relative

337.44 --> 346.02
because ya the money isn't not really

339.9 --> 350.96999999999997
worth that much anyway to compare these

346.02 --> 353.34
prices to like 20 or 30 years ago those

350.97 --> 357.3
would have been the expensive versions

353.34 --> 360.84
and you could get really really cheap F

357.3 --> 364.169
as versions that were so dirt cheap

360.84 --> 365.48999999999995
that's embarrassing and then they would

364.169 --> 367.32
get the problems and now they've

365.49 --> 369.0
switched it around apparently because if

367.32 --> 372.3
you want to get the expensive versions

369.0 --> 375.0
it's so astronomical the prices you'd

372.3 --> 376.62
you'd have to be middle-class or you

375.0 --> 381.409
couldn't you couldn't even get yourself

376.62 --> 381.409
to consider it so yay

384.279 --> 395.579
euro the euros is doing [ __ ] really

391.179 --> 403.029
and I've also noticed price raising

395.579 --> 405.42900000000003
everywhere like very note to sleep now a

403.029 --> 409.569
minor adjustment it's just not a good

405.429 --> 415.50899999999996
sign economically but whatever it's

409.569 --> 419.67900000000003
gonna be what its gonna be and I'll live

415.509 --> 422.97900000000004
through it yeah also a great relief was

419.679 --> 424.95899999999995
that seems that most of my back problems

422.979 --> 433.209
have now been resolved to this night

424.959 --> 435.459
because I woke up I can just know the

433.209 --> 439.709
muscles are still a little bit sore it

435.459 --> 443.039
seems to be like a type of workouts or

439.709 --> 447.789
because they have been very tense very

443.039 --> 451.449
persistently for a few days yeah half a

447.789 --> 453.669
week so that makes sense but think it's

451.449 --> 456.879
finally over and all that [ __ ] is

453.669 --> 459.93899999999996
finally over and very symbolically the

456.879 --> 462.699
Sun broke through today and I've noticed

459.939 --> 465.72900000000004
a couple of flowers like early spring

462.699 --> 470.48900000000003
flowers popping up here and there very

465.729 --> 470.489
very encouraging to see

472.3 --> 481.3
yeah yesterday night yeah this is it's

479.59 --> 484.33
really something else now with YouTube

481.3 --> 487.51
because I've noticed yesterday and

484.33 --> 491.32
probably the days before that there were

487.51 --> 496.27
just live streams from the moment I wake

491.32 --> 504.04
up to the moment I go to sleep numb stop

496.27 --> 507.06
just non-stop constantly so yeah it's a

504.04 --> 507.06
real life catcher

509.69 --> 520.18
it's not much time for other things that

512.03 --> 520.18
way I'm a part of it so

520.99 --> 528.29
yeah I got a really nice shoutout from

525.32 --> 531.0200000000001
Patricia steer and Nathan Oakley and

528.29 --> 534.23
Anthony Riley on the uncursed show

531.02 --> 538.28
yesterday I really appreciated that it's

534.23 --> 541.87
very nice of them very flattering so

538.28 --> 541.87
yeah shout out to them as well

551.7 --> 560.11
all right Jessa Conda well it is

555.46 --> 565.87
education is human education trying to

560.11 --> 569.34
show what it is to be me and there's

565.87 --> 572.68
definitely some psychological and

569.34 --> 575.26
conceptual education going on here so I

572.68 --> 577.78
completely disagree with you and yeah

575.26 --> 582.37
anything is entertainment depending on

577.78 --> 587.86
the perspective so that's that's not the

582.37 --> 590.79
right category is education yeah may not

587.86 --> 595.77
be university education although in some

590.79 --> 600.8399999999999
fragments it kind of is because I don't

595.77 --> 606.6999999999999
abide to a curriculum that is dictated

600.84 --> 613.0500000000001
to be the correct education now I go by

606.7 --> 616.6600000000001
my own understanding what I figured out

613.05 --> 621.3299999999999
and what works because yeah I went

616.66 --> 621.3299999999999
through all this [ __ ] and I didn't

622.02 --> 631.39
didn't even once like consider whether I

626.68 --> 634.5699999999999
should call my doctor or anything no

631.39 --> 636.1
just I know what this is I'm gonna sit

634.57 --> 639.7600000000001
through it it's gonna suck I'm gonna

636.1 --> 641.4
need some support other people got it

639.76 --> 648.28
very thankful for that

641.4 --> 650.74
we feel very warm and welcomed and now

648.28 --> 654.55
I'm getting through it and yeah no

650.74 --> 659.5600000000001
doctor nothing no don't need that

654.55 --> 661.93
maybe yeah some wise words maybe some

659.56 --> 665.4
ethereal healing your and air about

661.93 --> 665.4
barely even barely

665.86 --> 672.24
and yeah good

684.81 --> 688.91
there's so much happening out there and

689.21 --> 694.1600000000001
I am getting distracted by everything

704.31 --> 707.31
yet

707.57 --> 717.44
Nick hm Lottie says be Lu et over

714.47 --> 718.72
Michael Daniel feels bilgey furious

717.44 --> 720.8290000000001
punch

718.72 --> 730.8100000000001
Randy flutters how you could see you

720.829 --> 730.81
just kinda wells Andrea browning so

732.79 --> 738.68
Nick seems to be continuing his sudden I

736.7 --> 743.26
don't know where flip-flopping of being

738.68 --> 748.4799999999999
a globe troll into a flat earth troll so

743.26 --> 751.93
righty dokie that is whatever it is I

748.48 --> 751.9300000000001
don't really care

756.68 --> 762.8599999999999
I rarely make friends by flip-flopping

759.7 --> 764.8900000000001
from whatever side your flip-flopping

762.86 --> 764.89
from

767.43 --> 770.7199999999999
hello voyage

771.279 --> 773.939
yeah

779.27 --> 786.16
I've just just right across the street

781.88 --> 786.16
that's just this amazing place

789.89 --> 795.17
it's just one of those details and yeah

792.47 --> 799.01
now more than ever I can appreciate and

795.17 --> 803.899
I have enjoyed them like even when

799.01 --> 806.51
things seem bleak from the emotions that

803.899 --> 808.459
color what you see there's just

806.51 --> 811.16
sometimes these things that pop out of

808.459 --> 813.6199999999999
nowhere very unexpectedly that are just

811.16 --> 815.899
extremely beautiful like the little

813.62 --> 816.519
light in the shadow and one of these

815.899 --> 823.579
things

816.519 --> 827.48
well chickens I love them and I used to

823.579 --> 829.91
hate like throwing hands when I was a

827.48 --> 831.8000000000001
kid maybe because my mother had hated

829.91 --> 834.769
them because they always would awake her

831.8 --> 836.3599999999999
at a time that's inconvenient to her but

834.769 --> 844.93
I kind of loved the sound of them now

836.36 --> 844.9300000000001
and yeah there's like this chicken house

845.05 --> 851.8599999999999
at the bottom floor of this very flat

848.52 --> 854.5889999999999
this apartment building and yeah it's

851.86 --> 857.589
always it sound so enthusiastic I just

854.589 --> 862.24
love it and right across the street yeah

857.589 --> 864.4300000000001
there's this house it's fancy garden and

862.24 --> 868.39
the guys obviously doing very well or

864.43 --> 870.31
spending a lot of money the expensive

868.39 --> 873.399
car so he's probably doing good business

870.31 --> 875.6199999999999
and he also has chickens and he just

873.399 --> 876.959
lets them walk around and they just

875.62 --> 880.149
cross the street

876.959 --> 882.67
whenever they think yeah whenever they

880.149 --> 885.399
want to and then they just go walking

882.67 --> 891.779
around in whatever's left of that forest

885.399 --> 891.779
over there and I just see them like I

893.37 --> 897.99
don't know scanning for bugs and

898.21 --> 905.6700000000001
and it's one of the most amazing things

901.0 --> 911.38
I just love seeing that it's like

905.67 --> 915.279
chickens walking around being chickens

911.38 --> 916.779
in a small patch of forest and it's just

915.279 --> 921.3389999999999
one of the most beautiful things I've

916.779 --> 927.93
ever seen it so basic yet so

921.339 --> 927.9300000000001
miraculously so yeah yes I am bit manic

929.61 --> 932.61
but

932.69 --> 944.5600000000001
I thank God that that is also there

938.62 --> 944.5600000000001
throughout every mood a person can be in

950.98 --> 960.91
yeah and when I grow up when yeah I

958.33 --> 964.2700000000001
would love to have them myself have

960.91 --> 967.18
chickens and really kind of make them

964.27 --> 969.37
into a project trying to get them really

967.18 --> 969.76
totally organic well shouldn't be too

969.37 --> 973.87
hard

969.76 --> 978.01
and that's right

973.87 --> 979.87
see if I can basically eat off their

978.01 --> 982.45
eggs because I will do that absolutely

979.87 --> 990.46
it's part of this setup part of the

982.45 --> 993.2700000000001
demand how that will work out that would

990.46 --> 993.27
be very cool

995.63 --> 1006.3
right so yeah let's just talk about a

1000.55 --> 1010.199
crazy idea that popped in my head that

1006.3 --> 1013.75
obviously don't recommend anyone doing

1010.199 --> 1016.149
but yeah maybe they will do it anyway at

1013.75 --> 1019.99
some point or maybe at some point it is

1016.149 --> 1021.85
almost naturally mandated I don't know

1019.99 --> 1024.539
but it's a crazy idea and it just

1021.85 --> 1027.13
thought like yeah I'm gonna be so

1024.539 --> 1030.189
freakin controversial and everything

1027.13 --> 1032.6200000000001
gonna be so against the official

1030.189 --> 1033.8190000000002
narrative which yes doesn't make any

1032.62 --> 1037.6589999999999
sense anymore anyway

1033.819 --> 1041.1399999999999
just gonna shave part of my mustache and

1037.659 --> 1043.449
then go make like a freakin Hitler

1041.14 --> 1046.949
speech in public and say everything

1043.449 --> 1051.46
that's wrong but still in a somewhat

1046.949 --> 1055.21
can't just be totally totally offensive

1051.46 --> 1057.13
and just like yes screw that all like

1055.21 --> 1060.76
I'm gonna say everything that we're not

1057.13 --> 1063.2800000000002
supposed to say everything and be very

1060.76 --> 1067.03
demonstrative and very riling up and

1063.28 --> 1069.19
also yeah just share like yeah what's

1067.03 --> 1073.24
the elite actually doing with us what

1069.19 --> 1077.02
are we letting them do with us it's

1073.24 --> 1083.559
crazy it's a crazy idea never I I'm not

1077.02 --> 1086.679
gonna do that would look stupid and I

1083.559 --> 1090.58
love my moustaches grown attached to it

1086.679 --> 1091.45
or it has grown attached to me one could

1090.58 --> 1095.62
say

1091.45 --> 1102.64
and yeah I'm surprised that I could even

1095.62 --> 1107.59
have one and I don't want to go out and

1102.64 --> 1110.4
be all hit three and [ __ ] stupid people

1107.59 --> 1110.3999999999999
won't get it

1113.8 --> 1119.95
or maybe they will and but would

1116.74 --> 1124.06
shouldn't get it I don't know just

1119.95 --> 1127.39
that's what mania does sometimes pushes

1124.06 --> 1130.1499999999999
you on the edge to do crazy stuff that

1127.39 --> 1133.93
normally you would be too reasonable to

1130.15 --> 1136.48
do or too fearful to do or whatever it's

1133.93 --> 1139.6000000000001
almost like yeah mania makes you

1136.48 --> 1143.85
actually take that crazy crazy steep

1139.6 --> 1146.6499999999999
path that's probably gonna end up lethal

1143.85 --> 1152.73
that's typically what mania does makes

1146.65 --> 1155.68
you do crazy things so yeah but maybe

1152.73 --> 1161.79
maybe 20 years ago I would have actually

1155.68 --> 1167.28
done that being that crazy but now I got

1161.79 --> 1167.28
responsibilities I gotta be consistent

1167.4 --> 1176.7900000000002
it's I have no choice I must be

1171.33 --> 1178.6499999999999
consistent it's critical because if you

1176.79 --> 1181.86
just throw everything loose and be crazy

1178.65 --> 1185.99
all the time then that's not gonna end

1181.86 --> 1188.7299999999998
up anywhere nothing can be built upon

1185.99 --> 1192.21
inconsistency and I have a youtube show

1188.73 --> 1196.2
and I have an audience I have a lor I

1192.21 --> 1201.63
have colleagues that can respect me

1196.2 --> 1203.79
I guess and I respect them and yeah if

1201.63 --> 1207.63
you do that it's kind of crazy thinks

1203.79 --> 1209.04
you're gonna disrupt things one way or

1207.63 --> 1214.5500000000002
the other it's just gonna cause more

1209.04 --> 1219.6299999999999
polarization and yeah it's let's just

1214.55 --> 1222.08
enjoy the life and smell the flowers for

1219.63 --> 1222.0800000000002
a moment

1227.46 --> 1238.5900000000001
and just enjoy it not get crazy hmm

1235.22 --> 1240.65
yes steady I am feeling better a lot

1238.59 --> 1240.6499999999999
better

1242.12 --> 1250.549
yeah you all want to see me through this

1244.94 --> 1252.38
of course dads are whedon you never

1250.549 --> 1255.559
really know what he's gonna do next

1252.38 --> 1260.5390000000002
gonna do crazy voices are gonna get all

1255.559 --> 1265.46
over emphasizing or angry seemingly

1260.539 --> 1272.6
irrationally loud like yesterday on the

1265.46 --> 1276.14
debates I just got really like and I

1272.6 --> 1280.9699999999998
made good points but yeah I was already

1276.14 --> 1284.929
like hurt because yeah there was this

1280.97 --> 1287.84
guy didn't really know him but he was a

1284.929 --> 1291.169
flat earther and he was arguing for the

1287.84 --> 1293.0
locality of the Sun so that's exactly

1291.169 --> 1297.14
down my life my lane

1293.0 --> 1299.33
I was like no no you can't look at a

1297.14 --> 1303.74
flashlight which you know to be a

1299.33 --> 1305.779
physical object causing light see how

1303.74 --> 1308.75
that works on its environment and then

1305.779 --> 1311.96
say see it is it looks exactly like the

1308.75 --> 1315.35
Sun so the Sun must be a flashlight in a

1311.96 --> 1317.39
literal location and he kept holding on

1315.35 --> 1322.1589999999999
to them kept even getting more pissed

1317.39 --> 1325.279
off so I would just Ram that down his

1322.159 --> 1330.409
throat like no physicality assumption

1325.279 --> 1334.159
bias so so difficult that whatever's out

1330.409 --> 1337.22
there you can't always just assume it is

1334.159 --> 1339.8300000000002
like something you actually know to be

1337.22 --> 1342.2
physically there in front of you even

1339.83 --> 1344.23
though you want it so much makes it so

1342.2 --> 1344.23
easy

1345.909 --> 1351.0390000000002
just like with spatial non-linearity so

1351.73 --> 1362.59
hard it's never gonna be easily proven

1358.399 --> 1362.59
in the small-scale never

1394.03 --> 1397.03
[ __ ]

1404.66 --> 1407.23
yeah

1414.49 --> 1417.21
yeah

1422.39 --> 1427.46
you're not gonna comment and keep

1425.149 --> 1431.3799999999999
deleting it because if I do if you do

1427.46 --> 1431.38
that then I'm gonna ban you

1440.57 --> 1448.519
right so yeah let's go into that earth

1445.07 --> 1450.9189999999999
for a moment this idea has been creeping

1448.519 --> 1455.029
up on me and it's an idea it's just

1450.919 --> 1460.8500000000001
another concept it's actually a concept

1455.029 --> 1463.85
quite different and not rectangular

1460.85 --> 1466.279
looping so yeah I deal with Cosmo

1463.85 --> 1472.029
Jeannie and I deal with all the options

1466.279 --> 1475.879
I take every form of presupposition that

1472.029 --> 1481.039
is potentially possible and then I

1475.879 --> 1485.509
explore it so what I figured out

1481.039 --> 1486.44
it's and I got messages from a long long

1485.509 --> 1489.85
time back

1486.44 --> 1495.8300000000002
the dark world everything all just

1489.85 --> 1500.36
fitting pieces and I'm thinking you all

1495.83 --> 1504.98
know the picture that I that I use many

1500.36 --> 1508.6689999999999
times or that's been part of my YouTube

1504.98 --> 1511.7
page for a long time the locator map

1508.669 --> 1514.0200000000002
with the islands at the North Pole

1511.7 --> 1517.14
supposedly

1514.02 --> 1520.23
and descriptions of these lands that are

1517.14 --> 1523.8000000000002
there supposed to be a very big

1520.23 --> 1525.51
continent and yeah one of the first

1523.8 --> 1528.21
Clues like you know but doesn't fit

1525.51 --> 1530.73
there in the disk you know special

1528.21 --> 1533.58
non-linearity doesn't fit so is land

1530.73 --> 1537.23
beyond or is it a mountain or what is

1533.58 --> 1544.1599999999999
this is the central thing in a disk or

1537.23 --> 1552.75
is it just not there is it actually a

1544.16 --> 1557.7900000000002
big big reverse around fake clue to lead

1552.75 --> 1561.69
us off because how many maps even

1557.79 --> 1564.87
ancient maps have any kind of clue of

1561.69 --> 1568.1100000000001
this place being there and now I'm not

1564.87 --> 1573.6599999999999
saying that it doesn't exist I'm just

1568.11 --> 1578.309
saying it may not be there specifically

1573.66 --> 1581.5700000000002
there think about it because yeah what

1578.309 --> 1586.32
what have we heard of Mount Meru and

1581.57 --> 1589.6699999999998
landmass giant rivers supposedly flowing

1586.32 --> 1591.84
up the mountain so they say four rivers

1589.67 --> 1597.0600000000002
kinetic mountain

1591.84 --> 1603.54
well then there's the whole thing and

1597.06 --> 1607.47
some maps other maps and look I might be

1603.54 --> 1610.92
wrong okay I this is purely speculative

1607.47 --> 1614.19
pure speculation but it just made me

1610.92 --> 1616.44
think it's very contrasting from what

1614.19 --> 1619.8600000000001
Martin littke seems to think but we seem

1616.44 --> 1622.65
to be contrasting a lot so fine not

1619.86 --> 1625.25
gonna take any hostilities from it and I

1622.65 --> 1632.3700000000001
hope he doesn't either

1625.25 --> 1637.61
what if and arctica is actually that

1632.37 --> 1642.1799999999998
land so they put it in the North Pole

1637.61 --> 1645.7099999999998
maybe it is actually Antarctica the

1642.18 --> 1645.71
South Pole and

1647.18 --> 1649.93
bear with me

1650.82 --> 1661.079
there is a saying that the earth is like

1654.509 --> 1665.279
a disk in a square and the four corners

1661.079 --> 1669.299
of the world are the pillars on which

1665.279 --> 1672.509
the world rests now that's very

1669.299 --> 1677.1589999999999
mysterious sounding but yeah if you

1672.509 --> 1680.009
think about a special nonlinear elements

1677.159 --> 1681.8290000000002
can be looping in some way or in another

1680.009 --> 1686.719
way

1681.829 --> 1691.579
like for example that globe would be

1686.719 --> 1697.44
yeah fee very much specially nonlinear

1691.579 --> 1701.6989999999998
but what if the earth were the disk

1697.44 --> 1705.329
shape after all and that disk would be

1701.699 --> 1709.679
inside a square those would be

1705.329 --> 1714.719
considered the four corners well what if

1709.679 --> 1721.5790000000002
those four corners would actually meet

1714.719 --> 1721.579
at the corner turning into a big cross

1722.7 --> 1729.69
and maybe there's rivers there as well

1726.389 --> 1732.4799999999998
now probably frozen over so what if

1729.69 --> 1735.6490000000001
Mount Meru is actually the combined

1732.48 --> 1741.84
corners of the square of the earth and

1735.649 --> 1747.619
maybe in ancient times it wasn't frozen

1741.84 --> 1752.6
and there would flow rivers up up to the

1747.619 --> 1752.6
to the corner point of it all

1758.27 --> 1763.9
it sounds very weird I don't know but it

1760.64 --> 1766.49
just feels like this may be something

1763.9 --> 1769.67
there's so much we don't really know

1766.49 --> 1775.21
about Antarctica how big it is it's

1769.67 --> 1778.13
definitely big as far as assumed but

1775.21 --> 1780.02
yeah maybe the earth is kind of the

1778.13 --> 1784.2800000000002
continents are kind of laid out like a

1780.02 --> 1787.61
disc but there's not really a barrier or

1784.28 --> 1795.46
a dome as it were at Antarctica but

1787.61 --> 1799.9399999999998
there may just be corners more land and

1795.46 --> 1805.6000000000001
where the end point is the corners they

1799.94 --> 1805.6000000000001
meet with the other three corners

1815.17 --> 1820.39
just just think about it for a moment

1818.32 --> 1824.29
it's almost like a folding puzzle that

1820.39 --> 1828.46
way disc earth yet the corners corners

1824.29 --> 1830.9099999999999
actually fold inwards and meet at the

1828.46 --> 1830.91
center

1831.94 --> 1836.8500000000001
is it like one of those paper folding

1834.37 --> 1836.85
thingies

1840.27 --> 1845.429
right so yeah Nathan is on 24 hours a

1843.96 --> 1847.44
day almost I don't know if you've

1845.429 --> 1849.929
noticed but he's doing so many premieres

1847.44 --> 1854.73
all the time he's pretty much on

1849.929 --> 1857.5800000000002
constantly so yeah he's on at the same

1854.73 --> 1862.79
time as every damn one okay everyone

1857.58 --> 1862.79
just doesn't mean anything

1864.89 --> 1867.46
yeah

1885.89 --> 1893.3200000000002
and you just find it all inspiring how

1889.64 --> 1893.3200000000002
blue this guy actually is

1898.22 --> 1904.4
still get gets a bit greyish brownish at

1902.06 --> 1909.3799999999999
the horizon because it is mostly just

1904.4 --> 1913.43
City territory after all but still the

1909.38 --> 1915.6000000000001
blue starts up pretty close to the

1913.43 --> 1919.94
horizon gets really

1915.6 --> 1919.9399999999998
really clear it's beautiful

1933.57 --> 1939.75
right

1935.19 --> 1944.49
who John Watson knows listen guys John

1939.75 --> 1948.75
Watson that troll he knows he knew it

1944.49 --> 1951.6
all always so listen to John Watson

1948.75 --> 1955.32
because he actually has the secret

1951.6 --> 1959.61
knowledge of what is totally real and he

1955.32 --> 1962.58
can just with great John Watson

1959.61 --> 1968.27
certainty declare what's wrong you're

1962.58 --> 1968.27
right brilliant

1988.01 --> 1998.21
right the Shadowcat funny isn't it

1991.73 --> 2001.2
yeah connected like a global yeah guess

1998.21 --> 2001.2
what it's all flat

2001.32 --> 2009.1899999999998
how many months or years do I need to

2006.64 --> 2011.0700000000002
keep sharing this I've been doing it for

2009.19 --> 2017.38
two years

2011.07 --> 2023.049
space is not linear it was in my

2017.38 --> 2031.21
freaking icon and I'm still the only one

2023.049 --> 2039.49
saying it how hard is it to realize it

2031.21 --> 2043.0
that when space is not linear the

2039.49 --> 2044.86
surface of the land and the sea and

2043.0 --> 2050.56
everything or everything on the plane

2044.86 --> 2053.609
the flat plane can be yeah almost

2050.56 --> 2060.129
anything you can conceptualize whatever

2053.609 --> 2066.81
the realm allows it to be so yeah it can

2060.129 --> 2071.379
be a flat globe or a flat globe you lead

2066.81 --> 2074.0499999999997
whatever weird shape could be dice

2071.379 --> 2077.679
shaped it doesn't really matter because

2074.05 --> 2080.25
it is all flat no matter the shape it's

2077.679 --> 2080.25
flat

2082.779 --> 2088.99
right it's all about the flat geometry

2098.37 --> 2104.85
oh yeah and I'd love for some more

2101.34 --> 2107.4300000000003
people out there in every chat to ask me

2104.85 --> 2110.24
where is your flat map where is your

2107.43 --> 2117.18
flat map well guess what

2110.24 --> 2123.02
all maps are flat the earth is flat so

2117.18 --> 2125.1
yeah all maps are flat earth maps and

2123.02 --> 2130.71
they're flat as well

2125.1 --> 2132.98
can't get more flat than maps in every

2130.71 --> 2132.98
sense

2148.3 --> 2157.4700000000003
Nik we are all flat earthers whether we

2153.97 --> 2157.47
realize it or not

2176.52 --> 2179.869
a chocolate same

2180.72 --> 2183.72
constants

2202.96 --> 2207.3
dan Winfield and Orthodox

2212.99 --> 2217.7
lotty

2215.25 --> 2225.64
and what

2217.7 --> 2225.64
you smoke the globe which part of it

2238.089 --> 2241.089
maruge

2243.53 --> 2248.9
all right truth seeker mafia now why

2247.43 --> 2252.35
would I need to kill the globe

2248.9 --> 2256.46
if the Flat Earth turns out to be a

2252.35 --> 2258.61
globe shaped Flat Earth you know seems

2256.46 --> 2258.61
like

2263.23 --> 2269.67
why would I want to do that I add much

2266.38 --> 2275.23
rather focus on just what is feeding the

2269.67 --> 2280.119
misconceptions like physicality

2275.23 --> 2282.91
assumption bias the inability to accept

2280.119 --> 2286.839
or even understand that space may not be

2282.91 --> 2288.97
linear the realization that everything

2286.839 --> 2293.29
we see in the heavens that is light

2288.97 --> 2297.339
based is light based and probably

2293.29 --> 2300.0099999999998
holographic or most likely holographic

2297.339 --> 2304.7799999999997
so seemingly so far ends just at the

2300.01 --> 2307.03
edge of our vision and that and that

2304.78 --> 2311.01
obstruction we see at the horizon is

2307.03 --> 2314.1090000000004
actually a part of optics optical slant

2311.01 --> 2317.26
it's just inherits to sight and it has

2314.109 --> 2320.74
nothing to do with a literal geometrical

2317.26 --> 2323.7700000000004
shape because that shows different types

2320.74 --> 2325.74
of elements small scale and on the

2323.77 --> 2330.22
larger scale

2325.74 --> 2333.22
so yeah all of this it's always been

2330.22 --> 2337.0299999999997
more about psychology and the response

2333.22 --> 2345.0299999999997
of humans to information than it is

2337.03 --> 2345.03
about some literal shape really

2357.22 --> 2360.8999999999996
good

2358.89 --> 2363.7999999999997
let the door hit you in the way out just

2360.9 --> 2363.8
condom

2381.06 --> 2384.17
old wanker

2391.97 --> 2397.6899999999996
Collegium geometry

2394.73 --> 2397.69
what is that

2443.26 --> 2446.26
okay

2448.79 --> 2453.25
oh there's something else

2460.75 --> 2466.29
all right projecting the sphere into a

2463.87 --> 2466.29
being

2471.81 --> 2475.999
yeah

2473.39 --> 2477.859
well look if the earth is yeah if the

2475.999 --> 2481.1899999999996
Earth's surface is interconnected like a

2477.859 --> 2483.22
sphere but in actuality is flat yeah

2481.19 --> 2487.9700000000003
there would definitely be a need to

2483.22 --> 2491.66
learn how to pray how to show the

2487.97 --> 2493.8489999999997
surface of the earth in a flat way so

2491.66 --> 2496.569
that makes perfect sense that would

2493.849 --> 2496.569
always arrive

2513.06 --> 2515.63
yeah

2543.22 --> 2550.1499999999996
well you know when it comes to pitch

2546.31 --> 2550.99
shouting out people I tend to absolutely

2550.15 --> 2554.02
not

2550.99 --> 2557.9799999999996
shout out anyone that calls for a

2554.02 --> 2564.43
shout-out in my chat doesn't really

2557.98 --> 2566.41
matter who you are in that sense alright

2564.43 --> 2571.1499999999996
yeah dan dan Winfield I will absolutely

2566.41 --> 2573.2799999999997
if I can and we'll try to get to that

2571.15 --> 2576.69
Amsterdam conference it would be very

2573.28 --> 2576.69
cool to see

2580.01 --> 2588.76
what's Issa are you criticizing my

2584.42 --> 2588.76
English are you serious

2607.91 --> 2610.8689999999997
oh really

2611.17 --> 2616.78
are you gonna do that Lottie

2613.6 --> 2620.02
are you gonna bring get some prostitutes

2616.78 --> 2623.4700000000003
and then walk in and start to have sex

2620.02 --> 2630.1
in public is that your real life porn

2623.47 --> 2631.6
bombing plan that's gonna be awkward but

2630.1 --> 2634.5299999999997
I think you'll just get arrested by the

2631.6 --> 2634.5299999999997
police if you do that

2651.72 --> 2663.839
I hope I didn't give anyone any crazy

2654.48 --> 2668.54
ideas here yeah it is still illegal to

2663.839 --> 2668.54
do that just remember even in Amsterdam

2694.17 --> 2705.079
yep yeah they got all kinds of things in

2700.079 --> 2705.079
Amsterdam they yeah

2705.18 --> 2713.3999999999996
Amsterdam was always like trying to be

2708.779 --> 2715.859
the most provocative the most sex and

2713.4 --> 2721.89
prostitution oriented thing in the world

2715.859 --> 2725.22
in its own way and yeah there are some

2721.89 --> 2727.23
weird things going on like I've even

2725.22 --> 2730.23
this is like a long time ago but there

2727.23 --> 2734.369
were even like gothic parties which yeah

2730.23 --> 2737.22
again just modest and regular and then

2734.369 --> 2740.13
they'd have like the other section right

2737.22 --> 2744.8289999999997
next to that where there's just like

2740.13 --> 2749.789
really weird fetish [ __ ] going on and

2744.829 --> 2752.52
disgusting dark groups and yeah so that

2749.789 --> 2754.2000000000003
was an Amsterdam I think it was even a

2752.52 --> 2756.869
regular thing I'm not entirely sure I

2754.2 --> 2759.799
don't really care but there's all kinds

2756.869 --> 2759.799
of things and there's like

2762.83 --> 2770.2999999999997
even like all that like special markets

2767.09 --> 2775.4500000000003
for anything sex related kind of items

2770.3 --> 2777.86
there like like huge it's crazy

2775.45 --> 2780.16
whatever they come up with they just do

2777.86 --> 2785.9500000000003
it there and just they screw it

2780.16 --> 2789.29
literally anyway

2785.95 --> 2790.0699999999997
look it's really not that interesting to

2789.29 --> 2793.58
me

2790.07 --> 2799.4
you know never been much of their any of

2793.58 --> 2802.94
that I don't need it no I think just

2799.4 --> 2805.48
humans are sexy enough when they're

2802.94 --> 2805.48
normal

2817.25 --> 2822.71
and at the end of the day many of the

2820.22 --> 2827.5099999999998
fetish people and everything they have a

2822.71 --> 2830.96
lot of lack of empathy not because they

2827.51 --> 2835.4
want to because they just don't connect

2830.96 --> 2837.92
well emotionally anymore that's why they

2835.4 --> 2842.54
then dive into the fetish stuff in the

2837.92 --> 2846.35
first place it's actually kind of sad in

2842.54 --> 2852.82
a way not trying to poopoo you can be a

2846.35 --> 2852.8199999999997
lot of fun I guess but I don't know

2853.67 --> 2859.73
think real relations and some of these

2857.269 --> 2863.5589999999997
people even do have real relations and

2859.73 --> 2866.42
they do it a copy whatever yeah why

2863.559 --> 2874.73
thanks for bringing that up den you

2866.42 --> 2876.859
again you always do that [ __ ] you know

2874.73 --> 2879.41
what I'm just gonna time you out for

2876.859 --> 2881.98
that gonna time you out for making me

2879.41 --> 2881.98
talk about

2889.43 --> 2895.1499999999996
keep your dirty mind to yourself be ill

2907.01 --> 2913.4700000000003
but yeah the Flat Earth conference which

2910.47 --> 2915.24
has absolutely nothing to do with

2913.47 --> 2918.87
anything that I talked about in the last

2915.24 --> 2924.6899999999996
few minutes yeah I want to be there and

2918.87 --> 2929.16
I want to meet these people face to face

2924.69 --> 2933.84
and actually get tangible proof that

2929.16 --> 2938.12
they are not a sentient experimental

2933.84 --> 2942.33
mind control programs virtual characters

2938.12 --> 2945.0299999999997
to drive us all insane I wanna touch

2942.33 --> 2948.09
them I want to touch them and it's like

2945.03 --> 2950.0400000000004
do you feel that what do you feel

2948.09 --> 2952.92
describe to me what you feel when I

2950.04 --> 2955.89
pinch your arm and do it right

2952.92 --> 2958.53
immediately no no contemplating no Reese

2955.89 --> 2959.7599999999998
no Google searches in the mind you gotta

2958.53 --> 2963.1800000000003
say to me immediately

2959.76 --> 2965.4
what are you feeling gotta prove to me

2963.18 --> 2971.94
that you're a real person I'm not gonna

2965.4 --> 2974.6
make you bleed to prove that but I want

2971.94 --> 2974.6
to know you're real

2978.85 --> 2987.43
and I want you to know that I am real as

2981.49 --> 2991.24
well because yeah so far it's not a lot

2987.43 --> 2995.68
of people on the seat on YouTube that

2991.24 --> 2996.4599999999996
have come from me to be a person in

2995.68 --> 2999.3999999999996
person

2996.46 --> 3002.16
except for yeah a few Dutch people like

2999.4 --> 3004.17
the other day so yeah there is some

3002.16 --> 3007.2599999999998
proof out there that I am actually a

3004.17 --> 3014.16
real person and though the CGI generated

3007.26 --> 3020.25
a I driven character although yeah in

3014.16 --> 3024.5099999999998
the end may turn out that everyone every

3020.25 --> 3027.8
single human being in the world was

3024.51 --> 3031.4700000000003
partially or maybe completely I driven

3027.8 --> 3034.59
whether we knew or not it's one of those

3031.47 --> 3041.5099999999998
things you know something becomes so

3034.59 --> 3041.51
powerful so transcendent then

3041.83 --> 3048.69
how would it not become part of

3045.91 --> 3055.7999999999997
everything and influence everything

3048.69 --> 3055.8
whether everything knows it or not right

3056.28 --> 3064.9900000000002
yes yes globe lovers busted I am a

3061.26 --> 3069.01
science I college achill operation and

3064.99 --> 3074.9799999999996
that psychological operation is based on

3069.01 --> 3078.5400000000004
awakening psychology studies learning

3074.98 --> 3083.02
about the nature of being human and

3078.54 --> 3088.5299999999997
feelings and the more hidden inner

3083.02 --> 3095.28
workings of psychology and dreams and

3088.53 --> 3100.02
our long long lost ethereal skills and

3095.28 --> 3100.02
that is my psychological operation

3105.59 --> 3111.7000000000003
sigh all beat artists rights right

3144.52 --> 3147.09
okay

3170.97 --> 3176.0
oh damn time has flown I guess I'm

3174.839 --> 3183.17
having fun

3176.0 --> 3183.17
sheesh that was fast almost an hour

3187.75 --> 3196.23
wait did mine ban you no way they timed

3192.79 --> 3196.23
you out right

3209.62 --> 3212.7599999999998
what like what

3215.69 --> 3218.38
it's ridiculous

3240.6 --> 3245.7599999999998
oh right by the way it's still

3242.64 --> 3251.39
referencing to be the SIA

3245.76 --> 3257.0
okay what I said is I am a sigh of

3251.39 --> 3257.0
does it mean that I am performing a SIA

3263.24 --> 3271.0989999999997
but sometimes I do feel like whatever I

3268.43 --> 3273.23
am what I've become through everything

3271.099 --> 3277.7200000000003
I've seen and went through that it is

3273.23 --> 3277.72
almost like a psychological experiment

3278.02 --> 3289.46
it's kind of creepy to me makes me feel

3284.02 --> 3294.14
like a puppet though but a puppet that

3289.46 --> 3299.41
is free except yeah you're only free to

3294.14 --> 3304.94
do what you are able to do and that is

3299.41 --> 3308.0
just how it works and yeah are you gonna

3304.94 --> 3311.2400000000002
do anything more than you ever wanted to

3308.0 --> 3317.42
do for example or see you're always

3311.24 --> 3320.72
contained by what you are so and also

3317.42 --> 3323.23
yeah where you allow yourself to go and

3320.72 --> 3323.23
change

3324.0 --> 3327.41
but the

3330.07 --> 3337.3
I'm not trying to do anything except

3333.07 --> 3339.82
just put out my ideas hold on to them

3337.3 --> 3346.48
when my intuition tells me okay this is

3339.82 --> 3348.73
right you know and it's a weird bit of a

3346.48 --> 3352.69
weird comparison but there are somebody

3348.73 --> 3358.18
else out there that is also doing it in

3352.69 --> 3362.7000000000003
his way and not trying to compare myself

3358.18 --> 3365.5
directly but yeah that's PJ because PJ

3362.7 --> 3368.0499999999997
also has a couple of concepts and

3365.5 --> 3370.87
everybody's completely drowned in them

3368.05 --> 3372.3700000000003
and they have become memes by themselves

3370.87 --> 3378.22
that is of course

3372.37 --> 3382.45
Aristarchus and de lodo but yeah I also

3378.22 --> 3384.6699999999996
referenced that yet in the end the joke

3382.45 --> 3387.2799999999997
may be on all of us because he may have

3384.67 --> 3391.48
been right in some way he's just too

3387.28 --> 3392.98
goofy to properly show how he might

3391.48 --> 3395.17
actually be right and he's always

3392.98 --> 3399.64
fooling around and getting into idiotic

3395.17 --> 3402.4300000000003
social behavior so but in a way he's

3399.64 --> 3405.19
doing the same thing just taking that

3402.43 --> 3407.77
one concept and just continuing you know

3405.19 --> 3410.2000000000003
now on the other hand I've been doing

3407.77 --> 3415.59
that with much more technical aspects

3410.2 --> 3417.6099999999997
and concepts spatial non-linearity

3415.59 --> 3422.3500000000004
holographic globe of the heavens at the

3417.61 --> 3426.6400000000003
edge of vision optical slant but I don't

3422.35 --> 3429.4
see people repeating this a lot although

3426.64 --> 3434.77
he had the trolls have to try and make

3429.4 --> 3437.98
fun of it like stupid sound silly

3434.77 --> 3440.74
optical sled every time I was somebody

3437.98 --> 3446.95
or somewhere in some hangout then

3440.74 --> 3451.9399999999996
trolls would appear see like it was a

3446.95 --> 3457.9199999999996
joke and guess who the joke

3451.94 --> 3459.9900000000002
ended up on eventually but yeah it's my

3457.92 --> 3463.44
intuition it's just what I see

3459.99 --> 3466.29
it's how everybody responds and I just

3463.44 --> 3468.4500000000003
feel this very clear it's not even a

3466.29 --> 3477.63
voice it's just a frequency it's just

3468.45 --> 3481.1699999999996
God saying like yep that's it and I

3477.63 --> 3485.9700000000003
think special non-linearity is a very

3481.17 --> 3488.76
very heavy heavy critical obstacle to

3485.97 --> 3491.6099999999997
overcome psychologically and I don't

3488.76 --> 3496.59
even have really have a conception of

3491.61 --> 3498.9300000000003
what will happen once that starts to

3496.59 --> 3502.31
actually sink in beyond anyone but

3498.93 --> 3505.44
myself I have no idea what will happen

3502.31 --> 3507.7799999999997
we like there's the thing every time

3505.44 --> 3509.85
somebody awakens to a concept to a

3507.78 --> 3515.1200000000003
realization they change in a way

3509.85 --> 3516.33
everything they do just becomes

3515.12 --> 3520.68
recrystallized

3516.33 --> 3522.5099999999998
re manifested slightly altered by the by

3520.68 --> 3525.24
the concept by the new depth by the

3522.51 --> 3528.3900000000003
information and this is a big one

3525.24 --> 3531.0
because it changes everything everything

3528.39 --> 3537.27
everything we understand about what we

3531.0 --> 3539.64
are living on about it shows the

3537.27 --> 3543.21
psychological needs to literal eyes

3539.64 --> 3545.37
things all that what's gonna happen once

3543.21 --> 3548.9
people actually start to figure out that

3545.37 --> 3548.9
there's really something to this

3550.15 --> 3557.059
and probably at that point I'll be doing

3554.42 --> 3559.76
other [ __ ] that's the weird part about

3557.059 --> 3562.849
it like I'm probably not even gonna be

3559.76 --> 3565.0690000000004
on YouTube anymore not saying that that

3562.849 --> 3568.28
will absolutely inevitably happen but

3565.069 --> 3572.63
saying that it's likely that once that

3568.28 --> 3575.119
really start to hits people and people

3572.63 --> 3577.9100000000003
start to like figure it out do their

3575.119 --> 3579.98
thing with it and make presentations and

3577.91 --> 3583.0389999999998
all that [ __ ] and I'll probably be doing

3579.98 --> 3587.44
something else like oh yeah yeah I've

3583.039 --> 3587.44
actually moved on to getting a real life

3588.64 --> 3594.74
and then who knows maybe people will

3592.43 --> 3597.89
come to me like oh look I wrote a book

3594.74 --> 3600.1699999999996
about your concept will you sign it for

3597.89 --> 3604.7889999999998
me or something I don't know maybe this

3600.17 --> 3606.77
is just the mania giving me all this all

3604.789 --> 3608.2990000000004
this hope or something false hope I

3606.77 --> 3613.42
don't know I don't really care at this

3608.299 --> 3616.4
moment I'm just enjoying the beautiful

3613.42 --> 3619.46
sunlight and all this clear sky that

3616.4 --> 3622.94
just stays clear just keeps clear and

3619.46 --> 3626.049
see even a plane flying right there it's

3622.94 --> 3626.049
not leaving anything

3626.68 --> 3637.21
that's how it should be that's a comm

3632.35 --> 3641.31
trail there and evaporates pretty

3637.21 --> 3641.31
quickly that's normal

3643.46 --> 3651.2
shouldn't leave behind stuff that fades

3647.869 --> 3656.029
out in a feather and then just becomes

3651.2 --> 3664.16
these weird natural-looking cloud

3656.029 --> 3666.38
formations can somebody please help me

3664.16 --> 3672.049
out with the damned trolls on getting

3666.38 --> 3676.4500000000003

3676.45 --> 3682.3089999999997
it's this one one a half full guy he is

true and he's constantly responding

3682.309 --> 3688.029
sucks oh please help me out and just

3684.47 --> 3688.029

3706.69 --> 3712.18
no not making anybody else involved not

3711.13 --> 3714.25
yet anyway

3712.18 --> 3716.91
although there are some people I am

3714.25 --> 3716.91
considering

3723.8 --> 3730.46
hmm anyway yeah I think I'm gonna be

3727.78 --> 3733.84
pretty much rounding out the show since

3730.46 --> 3733.84
the debates have already started

3749.19 --> 3755.28
it's hilarious when when trolls try to

3753.329 --> 3758.789
be annoying but they are actually

3755.28 --> 3765.0890000000004
incredibly heartwarming the hilarious

3758.789 --> 3768.42
instead ah no don't do that I love that

3765.089 --> 3769.799
sock things he is amazing or she or

3768.42 --> 3774.4700000000003
whatever it's supposed to be

3769.799 --> 3778.589
representing know that Sokka is allowed

3774.47 --> 3780.6299999999997
unless he starts being disgusting now

3778.589 --> 3782.91
just a one and a half fault guy because

3780.63 --> 3786.27
he's constantly responding sucks don't

3782.91 --> 3789.48
worry don't worry I get it but yeah

3786.27 --> 3792.42
again the fist rule only trolls that are

3789.48 --> 3795.569
really trolling and being obvious

3792.42 --> 3798.15
obnoxious pieces of sh it's not just a

3795.569 --> 3801.0589999999997
any troll name unless they are really

3798.15 --> 3804.2400000000002
like you know the typical disgusting

3801.059 --> 3807.119
troll names yeah you could ban disease

3804.24 --> 3809.7599999999998
but somebody gets a goofy name

3807.119 --> 3813.77
that's Arwen related I'm fine with that

3809.76 --> 3817.25
as long it is creative and not to

3813.77 --> 3817.25
revoltingly vile

3819.59 --> 3827.6600000000003
nope no Dungeons and Dragons tonight I

3822.41 --> 3831.1099999999997
think wait let me check might be wrong

3827.66 --> 3838.58
actually now it should be you had the

3831.11 --> 3840.56
17th no this Sunday I'll talk to you do

3838.58 --> 3843.0099999999998
the real you and not the sock that

3840.56 --> 3855.17
pretends to be one of my D&D friends

3843.01 --> 3859.01
talk to them soon hmm yeah thanks

3855.17 --> 3865.04
everyone for coming and seeing another

3859.01 --> 3868.0400000000004
side again more more energetic inspired

3865.04 --> 3869.96
manic side I guess which has its own

3868.04 --> 3874.43
danger than they even explained it so I

3869.96 --> 3876.89
hope I hope you remembered that I I was

3874.43 --> 3880.1
telling you that when I was actually not

3876.89 --> 3882.65
doing very well like yeah mania is

3880.1 --> 3889.16
probably even more dangerous than

3882.65 --> 3890.609
depression and I am doing my best not to

3889.16 --> 3894.3289999999997
go

3890.609 --> 3896.279
too crazy although I am just like I'm

3894.329 --> 3898.4990000000003
holding back when I am depressed

3896.279 --> 3902.279
I am also holding back when it said

3898.499 --> 3904.799
constant at the same time yeah the light

3902.279 --> 3907.95
fills me up and really feeds me

3904.799 --> 3910.38
nourishes me and it's just like trying

3907.95 --> 3914.22
to make me push to do Fralick II crazy

3910.38 --> 3917.339
things and just have to hold back that's

3914.22 --> 3921.4399999999996
all so it's it's much more comfortable

3917.339 --> 3924.72
than being pushed by depression but yeah

3921.44 --> 3927.96
it's much more seductive to actually do

3924.72 --> 3932.45
do over-the-top crazy things and I don't

3927.96 --> 3935.279
do that so yep don't do anything bad

3932.45 --> 3944.3089999999997
it's also my recommendation for all of

3935.279 --> 3949.289
you don't be bad yeah Voynich yeah in a

3944.309 --> 3952.829
way manic-depressive yeah that is sort

3949.289 --> 3955.309
of the nature of it but it's yeah as I

3952.829 --> 3958.5890000000004
said it's relatively mild and the way

3955.309 --> 3961.3190000000004
the symptoms express themselves with me

3958.589 --> 3964.2
seem to be uniquely balanced with all

3961.319 --> 3967.95
these weird extra things like when I'm

3964.2 --> 3969.8799999999997
depressed I conserve leave like look in

3967.95 --> 3971.77
the darkness and all that

3969.88 --> 3976.11
and I guess when I manic I seem to be

3971.77 --> 3979.96
extra creative or more comedic Oh

3976.11 --> 3981.85
inspired I don't know what that is but

3979.96 --> 3983.23
yeah there's people with manic

3981.85 --> 3985.2999999999997
depression out there that are just

3983.23 --> 3988.09
totally over the top

3985.3 --> 3990.67
those are officially classified

3988.09 --> 3992.7400000000002
medically as manic depressive and they

3990.67 --> 3993.34
get really really bad when they get

3992.74 --> 3996.0099999999998
depressed

3993.34 --> 3998.3700000000003
they are suicidal and when they get

3996.01 --> 4002.01
manic they go completely apeshit

3998.37 --> 4004.02
literally sometimes just go completely

4002.01 --> 4010.32
over-the-top do crazy things do

4004.02 --> 4013.14
incredibly dangerous things like yeah

4010.32 --> 4016.32
that's real manic depression and what I

4013.14 --> 4022.8599999999997
have is you can't even compare it to

4016.32 --> 4026.01
that but I do have something and it does

4022.86 --> 4028.4700000000003
influence me and that's what has also

4026.01 --> 4032.67
been trying to just openly demonstrate

4028.47 --> 4035.37
and that it's not bad necessarily

4032.67 --> 4038.4
and I think that just so many people out

4035.37 --> 4042.2999999999997
there are in some way or sometimes

4038.4 --> 4044.94
touched by these elements it kind of

4042.3 --> 4048.9300000000003
gives more Flair it it's a bit of a

4044.94 --> 4052.12
swing of the pendulum and it gives it

4048.93 --> 4056.1499999999996
gives a little bit more Flair

4052.12 --> 4060.65
what would be all this positivity worth

4056.15 --> 4063.17
if you didn't have a lack of it in the

4060.65 --> 4069.23
first place to show you how valuable it

4063.17 --> 4074.09
really is you know without the darkness

4069.23 --> 4077.75
the lights doesn't seem so bright so

4074.09 --> 4083.9
yeah it's all part of it it's McLeod's

4077.75 --> 4085.52
feeling frolic is [ __ ] good so yeah I'm

4083.9 --> 4089.6800000000003
