it's not windy and it's not that moist

223.84 --> 228.64000000000001
uh it's a little a little cold still

227.36 --> 231.59900000000002
though but

228.64 --> 232.48
in combination with the sun it's really

231.599 --> 234.56
nice oh and

232.48 --> 236.64
there's the sickle of the moon by the

234.56 --> 238.64000000000001
way i don't know if this webcam can pick

236.64 --> 241.83999999999997

238.64 --> 241.83999999999997
right over there

252.4 --> 260.079
so let's see who's in chat james mason

255.76 --> 263.28
first psychics traveler

260.079 --> 263.919
yeah good morning to you it's friday the

263.28 --> 269.84
19th

263.919 --> 269.84
of march 2021

272.32 --> 277.919
and i'm still kind of waking up i got up

275.12 --> 279.919
pretty late today

277.919 --> 282.24
but yeah i did go to bed pretty late as

279.919 --> 283.919
well so it's not too surprising lots of

282.24 --> 287.52
stuff

283.919 --> 291.75899999999996
going down hello

287.52 --> 297.84
ores oh a vitajian

291.759 --> 297.84000000000003
what hello

299.199 --> 304.08000000000004
two opposite celestial spins proof the

302.4 --> 307.35999999999996
earth is not spinning

304.08 --> 309.28
it doesn't prove that

307.36 --> 311.84000000000003
but yeah the earth is not spinning

309.28 --> 315.039
that's correct

311.84 --> 325.84
it's just something else spinning

315.039 --> 325.84
all right

328.88 --> 336.96
yeah yesterday yesterday's show

333.68 --> 340.40000000000003
was pretty good i thought

336.96 --> 343.68
didn't watch it back though but

340.4 --> 346.79999999999995
yeah the the flat earth debate man

343.68 --> 349.52
sheesh like nathan was uh

346.8 --> 350.0
in is kind of a mood too and like he

349.52 --> 353.28
went

350.0 --> 353.6
pretty hard at added especially towards

353.28 --> 356.63899999999995
ken

353.6 --> 361.199
wheeler and his

356.639 --> 364.319
apparent dynward bias now

361.199 --> 366.319
not entirely sure of what ken wheeler if

364.319 --> 370.0
he literally says that

366.319 --> 372.24
might be he's a glober you know people

370.0 --> 376.24
especially on the flat earth side tend

372.24 --> 376.24
to overlook that for some reason

377.199 --> 383.84000000000003
but yeah nathan went at it

381.039 --> 384.479
especially in the after show that lasted

383.84 --> 387.19899999999996
three

384.479 --> 389.039
or the total show yeah the after show

387.199 --> 391.12
lasted two hours the total thing was

389.039 --> 395.84
like three and a half hours

391.12 --> 395.84000000000003
so it's pretty intense

398.4 --> 401.59999999999997
hello jaja light

402.8 --> 409.44
how does it turn can twist a bar

406.84 --> 412.479
what yeah

409.44 --> 416.08
this don't know

412.479 --> 416.08
about that psychics traveler

416.4 --> 422.88
but yeah that was pretty heavy and it

419.44 --> 426.639
was apparently the theme of the day

422.88 --> 430.15999999999997
later in the evening my friend

426.639 --> 430.16
from naimeh called again

432.8 --> 437.84000000000003
and that was yeah that was good

441.28 --> 450.55999999999995
right a yeah and after that

446.08 --> 454.15999999999997
yeah bob indeed did go live

450.56 --> 457.199
and me and the guys were kind of like

454.16 --> 458.0
watching that and having some fun

457.199 --> 461.199
commenting

458.0 --> 462.08
among ourselves since we were all banned

461.199 --> 465.28000000000003
from the chat

462.08 --> 469.12
over there surprise surprise but

465.28 --> 469.11999999999995
yeah it was kind of hysterical

470.8 --> 475.599
because what bob was basically doing was

473.52 --> 478.31899999999996
going through the entire thing

475.599 --> 480.4
his i guess i guess you could call it a

478.319 --> 484.8
standard presentation

480.4 --> 484.79999999999995
of if preponderance of concepts

484.96 --> 492.08
but this time he just like every

488.8 --> 495.28000000000003
minute or so he would reference and the

492.08 --> 497.919
other guys that shall not be named

495.28 --> 498.71999999999997
who don't like it who don't like my

497.919 --> 500.87899999999996
ideas

498.72 --> 503.28000000000003
it was constantly doing that it was

500.879 --> 503.28000000000003
really

505.039 --> 512.159
it was just hysterical it was really

508.319 --> 513.2
really funny and we were having a lot of

512.159 --> 516.24
fun with it

513.2 --> 516.24
from beginning to end

516.56 --> 523.3599999999999
and yeah i made notes just for reference

521.44 --> 524.6400000000001
with the guys i'm not even look i'm not

523.36 --> 527.6800000000001
gonna

524.64 --> 530.399
analyze the entire thing what happened

527.68 --> 535.8389999999999
here on my show

530.399 --> 535.839
but so many silly things were said

536.32 --> 543.2
and those all those pokes all the time

539.36 --> 543.2
it was just like

546.08 --> 552.08
it was so telling it was just funny

552.32 --> 559.6800000000001
because yeah when it came to the

556.0 --> 561.76
the actual arguments there was just no

559.68 --> 563.68
update whatsoever it's just the same

561.76 --> 567.68
thing it's just the same thing

563.68 --> 569.76
except this time periodic insertions of

567.68 --> 573.04
being very complaining about how some

569.76 --> 573.04
people don't like it

573.279 --> 579.399
but like he even like i'll note this

577.2 --> 581.36
spent like half an hour praising the

579.399 --> 584.399
gravimeter

581.36 --> 588.5600000000001
for its downwards acceleration

584.399 --> 588.56
measuring capability serious

588.72 --> 591.839
so yeah it just

592.0 --> 596.64
doubled down on everything

598.64 --> 602.16
and it kind of felt like what ballers do

601.44 --> 605.839
anyways

602.16 --> 608.88
like go away just every argument

605.839 --> 611.6
is being addressed done just then just

608.88 --> 613.519
complain about it get at homie

611.6 --> 619.839
and then start from the beginning square

613.519 --> 619.839
one like it was 2015 all over again

621.36 --> 627.519
just doing the same thing over and over

624.32 --> 627.519
again from scratch

627.839 --> 630.0790000000001
it's

630.959 --> 647.8389999999999
it was just i can only just describe it

634.88 --> 647.8389999999999
as really freaking funny at this point

649.12 --> 654.079
okay you don't have to caps that jaja

651.76 --> 654.079
light

656.0 --> 662.64
right but our kinds

659.2 --> 666.32
you have to better define that though

662.64 --> 669.68
because i consider my kinds to be people

666.32 --> 673.44
that would get real and stay

669.68 --> 678.0
real and not

673.44 --> 678.0
act in pseudoscientific kind of ways

678.24 --> 684.88
and just stick to factual descriptions

682.24 --> 687.12
and conceptual descriptions and separate

684.88 --> 687.12
them

687.76 --> 695.36
and not try to reify anything about that

691.76 --> 696.88
beyond the experiment actual experiment

695.36 --> 699.279
at some test

696.88 --> 701.76
not oh look this guy that does a lot

699.279 --> 704.8
he's the master of

701.76 --> 708.399
electro blah blah blah oh he

704.8 --> 711.519
says this is it this vague

708.399 --> 713.279
notion about how everything works and

711.519 --> 717.04
since he said it and we think he's so

713.279 --> 718.8
freaking awesome we're just going to

717.04 --> 724.079
accept it

718.8 --> 727.68
like a consensus decision

724.079 --> 728.079
and yeah that all those types of actions

727.68 --> 731.1999999999999
that's

728.079 --> 732.88
we all the flat earth debates are

731.2 --> 736.32
against that

732.88 --> 738.959
it's that simple it's like

736.32 --> 741.519
why we don't even have to get personal

738.959 --> 745.04
anymore it's just

741.519 --> 748.32
just pointing at every every second as

745.04 --> 748.3199999999999
it is transpiring it

748.8 --> 754.399
right i mean

752.48 --> 757.2
everybody that has followed flat earth

754.399 --> 760.639
debates like even the ballers themselves

757.2 --> 762.8000000000001
they should be seeing this they should

760.639 --> 762.8
be

767.36 --> 773.839
and i think they are so yeah

775.76 --> 779.279
it's yeah it's just not having the

777.92 --> 783.5999999999999
influence i think

779.279 --> 785.519
he has yeah he has

783.6 --> 787.519
not getting out of my words today it

785.519 --> 789.92
doesn't have the influence he thinks

787.519 --> 789.92
it has

791.839 --> 795.839
because i don't think people are falling

793.76 --> 798.3199999999999
for that anymore we've been all been

795.839 --> 798.32
trained

799.12 --> 802.32
with keeping it real the scientific

801.839 --> 805.44
method

802.32 --> 809.519
and how do you source things

805.44 --> 812.0790000000001
how do you avoid consensus accepting

809.519 --> 815.839
of concepts that have not been

812.079 --> 815.8389999999999
empirically validated

821.279 --> 830.16
what blue brine

824.48 --> 830.16
sold what what are you talking about

834.0 --> 837.68
right yeah neil i totally agree there

836.72 --> 840.88
that's

837.68 --> 842.8
i'm not angry see i'm not angry i'm not

840.88 --> 845.519
frustrated about it

842.8 --> 846.56
i literally just had a great time

845.519 --> 851.36
yesterday it was

846.56 --> 854.7199999999999
really funny with the guys in the chat

851.36 --> 857.839
it was it was literally hysterical

854.72 --> 860.9590000000001
that's why i hang around like

857.839 --> 860.9590000000001
i guess normally

861.199 --> 864.4799999999999
it'd be more boring

865.519 --> 868.5600000000001
and then i just wouldn't pay that much

867.36 --> 871.76
attention but

868.56 --> 873.5189999999999
it was just so funny yesterday that yeah

871.76 --> 875.6
just had to keep watching from beginning

873.519 --> 876.079
to end and just with the guys in the

875.6 --> 879.279
chat

876.079 --> 879.279
and yeah

880.0 --> 885.76
it was just very amusing i i don't feel

882.639 --> 889.76
threatened or

885.76 --> 889.76
or aggravated in the slightest

890.24 --> 896.9590000000001
will that be in the after show no no

893.279 --> 897.36
it was not not recorded now the after

896.959 --> 900.959
show

897.36 --> 903.36
was the situation with this guy daislo

900.959 --> 905.3599999999999
who basically was trying to defend ken

903.36 --> 908.8000000000001
wheeler

905.36 --> 913.12
some diagram that had literally had an

908.8 --> 915.68
arrow downward with mass slash gravity

913.12 --> 917.36
and nathan was just yeah doing what he

915.68 --> 920.0
does

917.36 --> 921.6
and the guy was squirting all over the

920.0 --> 923.92
place to the point where he was

921.6 --> 927.839
literally threatening nathan with

923.92 --> 927.8389999999999
physical violence

928.48 --> 934.16
instead of just conceding so yeah that

931.68 --> 934.16
happened

934.399 --> 939.199
so definitely check out saturday's flat

937.279 --> 941.92
earth debate premiere because it's

939.199 --> 942.24
it's going to be a blast too but that's

941.92 --> 944.88
not

942.24 --> 945.839
the the thing we did in the skype chat

944.88 --> 948.88
with guys

945.839 --> 949.2790000000001
watching glowbusters yesterday that's

948.88 --> 952.399
not

949.279 --> 955.279
recorded but i'm pretty sure

952.399 --> 956.959
that it's going to be talked about on

955.279 --> 960.0
friday and today's

956.959 --> 964.6389999999999
flat earth debate shows

960.0 --> 968.639
with neil yeah already discussed like if

964.639 --> 969.839
if we want to prevent us from talking

968.639 --> 972.72
about

969.839 --> 976.8000000000001
globe busters over at flat earth debate

972.72 --> 976.8000000000001
then we're going to have to ban neil

sorry neil we have no choice you can't

980.56 --> 986.16
come on the flat earth debate today

982.16 --> 986.16
because otherwise it's guaranteed

995.6 --> 1011.839
but yeah that's that's a joke

998.639 --> 1011.839
i hope you caught that

1013.04 --> 1016.7199999999999

1216.0 --> 1222.159
an episode based short stories

1219.44 --> 1223.679
and it's really cute it's really nice

1222.159 --> 1227.2800000000002
and it's really cultural

1223.679 --> 1231.039
so like really a lot of japanese culture

1227.28 --> 1235.44
is inserted in it and it's just

1231.039 --> 1239.28
very nice and sensitive

1235.44 --> 1242.559
and yeah i had i had fun with that

1239.28 --> 1245.9189999999999
like the first few episodes

1242.559 --> 1249.84
it's like this book of

1245.919 --> 1249.8400000000001
very cute short stories

1253.6 --> 1263.84
that's pretty much it still went to bed

1257.039 --> 1263.84
pretty late

1269.919 --> 1273.1200000000001
yeah blue brine i don't know what the

1271.52 --> 1277.84
hell you're blabbering about but it's

1273.12 --> 1277.84
all nonsense

1285.6 --> 1291.84
i'm a man of culture well i do

1288.159 --> 1291.8400000000001
appreciate culture

1295.52 --> 1301.12
and yeah this was just very

1298.96 --> 1302.64
very like very serious this series is

1301.12 --> 1306.2399999999998
just very personal

1302.64 --> 1310.7990000000002
up and close into

1306.24 --> 1314.559
yeah japanese japanese characters

1310.799 --> 1314.559
so i just yeah i just like that

1315.2 --> 1318.799
and it's also nice to watch something

1317.2 --> 1321.679
that isn't about

1318.799 --> 1323.28
extreme drama and death and violence and

1321.679 --> 1326.0
[ __ ]

1323.28 --> 1327.28
or just over excited nonsense it's just

1326.0 --> 1330.559
very

1327.28 --> 1331.84
simple and nice and cute not something

1330.559 --> 1334.48
that's over exciting

1331.84 --> 1338.72
so yeah the series is something you

1334.48 --> 1338.72
could also watch to really calm down

1344.84 --> 1350.24
so

1346.72 --> 1361.84
okay yeah you're get out stop wasting my

1350.24 --> 1361.84

okay neil cosentino james mason said

1512.08 --> 1515.6
that

1513.2 --> 1518.32
i still don't know what exactly you're

1515.6 --> 1518.32
referencing

1519.039 --> 1529.84
something in the 70s i guess

1530.08 --> 1535.76
wait are james mason are you referencing

1532.96 --> 1538.159
dr gonzo's

1535.76 --> 1539.679
iss supposedly flying over is that what

1538.159 --> 1542.3200000000002
you mean

1539.679 --> 1544.72
otherwise i literally can't i don't know

1542.32 --> 1547.2
what you're talking about

1544.72 --> 1547.2
otherwise

1548.0 --> 1551.039
the size of a plane obviously is much

1550.559 --> 1554.48
higher

1551.039 --> 1557.84
okay okay fine we'll see

1554.48 --> 1557.84
or not

1567.36 --> 1571.84
hey julia up heaven good morning

1591.679 --> 1599.8400000000001
hey amanda young good to see you

1624.84 --> 1627.84
do

1628.4 --> 1641.8400000000001
hey tara 306 good to see you

1652.84 --> 1655.84
right

1664.64 --> 1669.8400000000001
fantasy island okay

1672.48 --> 1675.2
daniel

1679.679 --> 1684.3200000000002
yeah that's definitely not from my

1681.679 --> 1684.3200000000002
generation

1692.08 --> 1695.6789999999999
but i think it might also be just kind

1694.96 --> 1698.96
of

1695.679 --> 1701.159
very usa i don't think like the

1698.96 --> 1705.039
netherlands was being

1701.159 --> 1711.8400000000001
particularly exposed by that series

1705.039 --> 1711.84
like all that came later

1715.6 --> 1723.1999999999998
it's really during the late 70s

1719.2 --> 1726.64
early 80s that america started to really

1723.2 --> 1730.559
basically export its

1726.64 --> 1733.6000000000001
tv shows and everything over here and

1730.559 --> 1737.279
so i grew up in a period where a lot of

1733.6 --> 1739.84
united states series were very popular

1737.279 --> 1739.84
here in the netherlands

1742.48 --> 1749.76
but this series before that time

1747.039 --> 1751.279
they just kind of stayed over there in

1749.76 --> 1755.76
the united states and not

1751.279 --> 1759.039
everything was exported to europe though

1755.76 --> 1759.039
like roughly half of it

1762.799 --> 1767.44
so i don't think like my parents would

1765.039 --> 1772.32
have seen

1767.44 --> 1772.3200000000002
fantasy island but i have heard of it

1774.799 --> 1777.76
whatever anyway

1778.84 --> 1782.9599999999998
uh name some

1788.32 --> 1795.36
it's just that like all the typical

1791.44 --> 1799.1200000000001
series like the a and knight rider

1795.36 --> 1800.399
and air wolf and all those types of

1799.12 --> 1803.76
series like they

1800.399 --> 1805.12
definitely unrolled here and were very

1803.76 --> 1809.679
popular

1805.12 --> 1812.32
as well you know the typical 80s that's

1809.679 --> 1815.919
really when the united states start

1812.32 --> 1815.9189999999999
start getting popular abroad

1817.35 --> 1823.1999999999998
[Music]

1819.84 --> 1825.6
yeah man a team

1823.2 --> 1827.1200000000001
a team's popularity has been very

1825.6 --> 1830.1589999999999
long-standing

1827.12 --> 1830.4799999999998
they kept replaying that [ __ ] and it's

1830.159 --> 1832.3990000000001
like

1830.48 --> 1833.52
every time somebody put that up it would

1832.399 --> 1836.08
always be funny

1833.52 --> 1836.8799999999999
it would always be amusing battlestar

1836.08 --> 1839.36
galactica

1836.88 --> 1841.6000000000001
yeah yeah all the sci-fi stuff too all

1839.36 --> 1841.6
that

1847.76 --> 1855.44
oh my god yes oakley is a real flat

1852.32 --> 1857.9189999999999
earther that's right alex d

1855.44 --> 1860.24
gotta be pretty damn stupid to think at

1857.919 --> 1863.279
this point that he isn't

1860.24 --> 1865.84
really really stupid

1863.279 --> 1868.24
because he literally declares it in the

1865.84 --> 1872.08
heat of the argument

1868.24 --> 1875.1200000000001
right now you got to be really

1872.08 --> 1879.36
really stupid at this point to think

1875.12 --> 1882.2399999999998
that nathan oakley is not a flat earther

1879.36 --> 1882.24
just so you know

1882.96 --> 1889.279
yeah neil yeah the a team is basically

1886.24 --> 1892.24
famous and infamous for like the

1889.279 --> 1893.279
the massive use of guns and explosive

1892.24 --> 1896.96
everywhere

1893.279 --> 1896.96
but nobody ever got hurt

1929.919 --> 1935.8400000000001
yeah you ain't getting me on a plane

1956.08 --> 1961.039
hmm little house on the prairie well a

1959.36 --> 1964.24
little house on the prairie is also

1961.039 --> 1966.72
popular but that series is just

1964.24 --> 1967.6
has been very popular among christian

1966.72 --> 1969.84
groups

1967.6 --> 1971.6789999999999
including in the netherlands you know

1969.84 --> 1975.1999999999998
house on the prairie is very

1971.679 --> 1978.88
well widely known in the world and

1975.2 --> 1991.8400000000001
it's a it's a really decent series

1978.88 --> 1991.8400000000001
it's really good

1995.12 --> 2005.84
i went to heaven i don't know that one

2018.72 --> 2022.32
the leader of our crew

2029.279 --> 2034.159
i wouldn't know about that neil but he's

2032.72 --> 2037.76
definitely the

2034.159 --> 2037.7600000000002
driving force

2038.08 --> 2044.96
that does bring us together

2041.76 --> 2044.96
leader i don't know

2045.44 --> 2052.079
i think we all have our own leadership

2049.04 --> 2055.119
and we just think that nathan

2052.079 --> 2057.52
is really doing a good job and he's

2055.119 --> 2059.2000000000003
like he's a hard ass too about it but

2057.52 --> 2062.72
with subtlety

2059.2 --> 2065.7599999999998
and that's just a quality that all of us

2062.72 --> 2067.839
appreciate and so

2065.76 --> 2069.599
it's not really a leader he doesn't tell

2067.839 --> 2072.24
us what to do

2069.599 --> 2075.839
except like on his show when he's trying

2072.24 --> 2075.839
to direct the conversation

2076.079 --> 2082.96
but other than that no

2079.839 --> 2088.639
we're all pretty much free to just do as

2082.96 --> 2090.639
is natural and sensible

2088.639 --> 2091.679
did you get to watch the old hulk series

2090.639 --> 2103.839
yeah yeah that one

2091.679 --> 2103.839
was on television here too that's right

2121.2 --> 2126.16
shazam no i don't know that one

2127.2 --> 2134.0789999999997
i think shazam was america only

2130.72 --> 2135.5989999999997
i think nobody else really cared

2134.079 --> 2138.0
i'm not sure though i don't know i've

2135.599 --> 2145.839
never seen it

2138.0 --> 2145.839
on television that is

2150.72 --> 2161.04
discovery of alien life that's no

2155.28 --> 2161.0400000000004
no it wouldn't there is no such thing

2161.28 --> 2165.0400000000004
there's a lot of life sure

2165.119 --> 2169.2000000000003
and there's a lot of undiscovered life

2167.28 --> 2170.0
it's not alien life though that's

2169.2 --> 2172.7999999999997
ridiculous

2170.0 --> 2173.28
there is no other place there is no

2172.8 --> 2176.7200000000003
other

2173.28 --> 2180.32
ecosystem everything that's alive

2176.72 --> 2182.48
is tied in to the terrestrial

2180.32 --> 2184.88
ecosystem one way or the other there

2182.48 --> 2188.64
might be giant

2184.88 --> 2191.04
inhospitable regions separating it

2188.64 --> 2194.56
but technically there is no separation

2191.04 --> 2194.56
there's direct air connection

2195.2 --> 2201.839
so every life is going to be part of

2198.32 --> 2205.6800000000003
the same original design this

2201.839 --> 2209.44
yeah the idea of completely separated

2205.68 --> 2215.16
alien formed life is a science fiction

2209.44 --> 2218.32
idea based on separated land masses

2215.16 --> 2229.839
conceptualized as planets

2218.32 --> 2229.839
it's just not true just isn't

2234.72 --> 2243.839
stop wasting my time guys

2263.44 --> 2272.2400000000002
oh what neil what the hell

2267.599 --> 2272.2400000000002
i think that's just nathan saying that

2272.64 --> 2275.68
for the fun of it

2278.56 --> 2286.7999999999997
like david is nobody's leader

2282.0 --> 2286.8
he's just getting out there and doing

2287.04 --> 2290.24
a lot of work representing flat earth on

2289.92 --> 2293.839
a

2290.24 --> 2294.3199999999997
on a very very decent level compared to

2293.839 --> 2296.4
most

2294.32 --> 2299.839
and i think that nathan respect him for

2296.4 --> 2299.839
that a lot

2300.64 --> 2304.16
and a bit joking about it

2304.8 --> 2309.6800000000003
about how he's the leader and the secret

2307.28 --> 2314.4
instructions and blah blah blah

2309.68 --> 2314.3999999999996
but that's just a joke to get the troll

2324.839 --> 2327.839
squirting

2339.28 --> 2344.96
yeah yeah bobby steals yeah david weiss

2342.32 --> 2347.2000000000003
is legit he's put himself out there big

2344.96 --> 2347.2
time

2350.48 --> 2356.16
right and hey do buy his app

2353.92 --> 2357.119
you know if you got a mobile phone i

2356.16 --> 2360.8799999999997
don't not

2357.119 --> 2363.599
not one that can carry apps like that

2360.88 --> 2365.2000000000003
but if i'd have one i think that getting

2363.599 --> 2369.839
david weiss's app would

2365.2 --> 2369.839
probably be one of the first things i do

2370.16 --> 2374.16
because i think it's a really good app

2374.24 --> 2386.4799999999996
and it's just good to have

2382.72 --> 2386.48
you know you got a reward quality

2395.44 --> 2402.32
oh yeah yeah it is accurate actually

2398.8 --> 2402.32
in convenient truth it is

2405.92 --> 2408.96
and there's plenty of people south of

2408.16 --> 2412.24
the equator

2408.96 --> 2424.48
that download his app because it is

2412.24 --> 2427.52
accurate it's accurate enough

2424.48 --> 2429.52
yeah so uh yeah everybody go and buy

2427.52 --> 2432.64
david weiss's app

2429.52 --> 2434.96
for three dollars she said james mason

2432.64 --> 2437.5989999999997
one-time pay of three dollars yeah

2434.96 --> 2440.2400000000002
that's that's a great

2437.599 --> 2441.04
that's a great price for an app like

2440.24 --> 2453.1189999999997
that

2441.04 --> 2455.359
it's awesome do it

2453.119 --> 2457.839
how would you know well i i would know

2455.359 --> 2461.119
it through other people

2457.839 --> 2464.72
and through this supposed issue

2461.119 --> 2467.28
you have nobody actually mentioning it

2464.72 --> 2467.7599999999998
ever not complaining about it you're

2467.28 --> 2470.6400000000003
just

2467.76 --> 2472.7200000000003
trolling right now you're just being

2470.64 --> 2475.1189999999997
nitpicky about something that you don't

2472.72 --> 2478.839
know anything about

2475.119 --> 2480.1600000000003
you're just making a claim just like

2478.839 --> 2482.56
that

2480.16 --> 2484.7999999999997
it's not based on anything though

2482.56 --> 2487.92
because if there was a legitimate

2484.8 --> 2490.96
issue and things did not work out

2487.92 --> 2491.599
then people would tell him that would

2490.96 --> 2494.4
become an

2491.599 --> 2496.1600000000003
issue that he would address and try to

2494.4 --> 2500.7200000000003
fix

2496.16 --> 2500.72
no that's a big assumption you're making

2502.16 --> 2507.04
did you download the app inconvenient

2505.76 --> 2512.1600000000003
truth

2507.04 --> 2515.359
did you did you download it

2512.16 --> 2517.359
did you download it did you pay the

2515.359 --> 2519.7599999999998
three dollars and then download it and

2517.359 --> 2520.64
then tested it to see hey this is not

2519.76 --> 2523.92
accurate

2520.64 --> 2526.64
did you or didn't you download it

2523.92 --> 2527.76
and you literally just made this [ __ ] up

2526.64 --> 2530.56
right on the spot

2527.76 --> 2531.3590000000004
to be a troll piece of [ __ ] inconvenient

2530.56 --> 2534.88
truth

2531.359 --> 2538.24
which one is it did you download it

2534.88 --> 2538.2400000000002
or didn't you download it

2538.56 --> 2543.68
oh yeah yeah you didn't download it did

2542.319 --> 2546.8
you

2543.68 --> 2547.7599999999998
so how would you know then how would you

2546.8 --> 2552.4
have tested it

2547.76 --> 2552.4
if you didn't even download it [ __ ]

2557.599 --> 2561.44
you got 30 seconds to respond

2562.0 --> 2566.319
oh you did okay well thanks thanks for

2565.359 --> 2569.5989999999997
donating

2566.319 --> 2569.599
that three dollars then

2569.92 --> 2573.359
send a complaint email to david wise and

2572.079 --> 2576.5600000000004
tell him how the sun

2573.359 --> 2579.839
position is not accurate south of the

2576.56 --> 2579.839
equator go ahead

2582.56 --> 2586.64
maybe do a hangout about it you know

2584.64 --> 2588.96
maybe do a complete live stream about it

2586.64 --> 2593.04
about how david weiss's app is not

2588.96 --> 2596.079
entirely accurate

2593.04 --> 2599.599
because hey if it is actually correct

2596.079 --> 2600.5600000000004
what you're saying then yeah i agree

2599.599 --> 2604.2400000000002
there should be

2600.56 --> 2607.04
something some detail changes to it

2604.24 --> 2610.8799999999997
in order to correct that if there is

2607.04 --> 2610.88
indeed a mistake like you suggest

2612.319 --> 2616.079
but yeah it must be pretty tough to

2613.92 --> 2619.6800000000003
point it out so why don't you just

2616.079 --> 2623.2000000000003
do a hangout about the app

2619.68 --> 2627.2799999999997
and then point out exactly

2623.2 --> 2629.4399999999996
how and where it is mistaken

2627.28 --> 2630.3190000000004
maybe give a suggestion on how to

2629.44 --> 2633.68
correct it

2630.319 --> 2637.44
right since the whole thing is just

2633.68 --> 2641.68
utilizing a map projection anyway

2637.44 --> 2644.56
right it's a projection

2641.68 --> 2644.56
the whole thing is

2646.079 --> 2650.7200000000003
now neo it's not about the map

2651.28 --> 2654.8
this guy is claiming that the sun

2653.28 --> 2658.88
positions is not

2654.8 --> 2658.88
accurate that is what he's claiming

2659.92 --> 2677.839
on the the based map representation

2699.76 --> 2705.6800000000003
all right yeah james mason i know

2702.8 --> 2706.4
i'm just laying out all the directions

2705.68 --> 2709.1189999999997
letting him

2706.4 --> 2711.28
pick from whatever double think

2709.119 --> 2711.6800000000003
perspective is convenient to him at the

2711.28 --> 2714.4
time

2711.68 --> 2716.319
and just let it unroll let it unroll

2714.4 --> 2716.8
everywhere he's like that's what i just

2716.319 --> 2720.4
did

2716.8 --> 2722.8
and he fell for it so

2720.4 --> 2725.359
then i addressed hey you actually have a

2722.8 --> 2726.4
legitimate concern about accuracy about

2725.359 --> 2728.319
this app

2726.4 --> 2730.8
or why didn't you actually do something

2728.319 --> 2730.8
about it

2730.839 --> 2733.839
huh

2734.88 --> 2739.52
instead of whining and others people's

2736.8 --> 2739.52
chat about it

2740.88 --> 2743.119
right

2744.079 --> 2750.8
right so either yes you drop

2747.119 --> 2753.44
the whining about that thing

2750.8 --> 2755.28
that you downloaded yet you say you

2753.44 --> 2759.599
didn't and now you say you do

2755.28 --> 2762.7200000000003
and whatever right

2759.599 --> 2763.92
you drop it and just start talking about

2762.72 --> 2766.0789999999997
something that is

2763.92 --> 2767.2000000000003
more interesting and that i might be

2766.079 --> 2775.8390000000004
able to communicate

2767.2 --> 2775.839
about you know talk about or i kick you

2780.8 --> 2788.7200000000003
well if you don't like people

2785.119 --> 2791.119
lying about what you say then don't

2788.72 --> 2791.1189999999997
lie

2791.92 --> 2795.119
and then pretend like you didn't say

2794.0 --> 2797.839
things right

2795.119 --> 2800.079
it's all here it's all on record right

2797.839 --> 2805.04
here

2800.079 --> 2805.04
right here in chat everything's set and

2815.68 --> 2821.1189999999997
oh it's definitely the answer for you

2818.48 --> 2831.839
neon boots

2821.119 --> 2831.839
definitely the answer that i got for you

2856.64 --> 2861.5989999999997
now inconvenient truth i'm not saying

2858.88 --> 2861.599
you're a liar

2861.76 --> 2866.0
kind of mixed it up like it's become

2863.839 --> 2872.7999999999997
right but you are here basically

2866.0 --> 2875.599
trying to slander somebody

2872.8 --> 2876.48
and you will drop it right now and if

2875.599 --> 2879.6800000000003
you're going to

2876.48 --> 2887.839
whine and complain about it some more i

2879.68 --> 2890.96
will ban you

2887.839 --> 2893.599
so go and do something about it make

2890.96 --> 2896.16
your own little video explaining exactly

2893.599 --> 2897.119
how it is technically wrong once you

2896.16 --> 2899.2
help them out

2897.119 --> 2900.319
right but you actually help correct

2899.2 --> 2903.5989999999997
something

2900.319 --> 2904.16
instead of whining and complaining how

2903.599 --> 2906.559
about

2904.16 --> 2907.5989999999997
everything is wrong all the flat

2906.559 --> 2909.28
earthers are wrong

2907.599 --> 2910.8
everything is wrong and just whine about

2909.28 --> 2914.3190000000004
that all day long

2910.8 --> 2916.2400000000002
yeah if it's so important to you and you

2914.319 --> 2920.0
did pay for the app

2916.24 --> 2920.0
then just make the video

2922.4 --> 2929.839
and shut the hell up whining about this

2926.839 --> 2929.839
[ __ ]

2934.64 --> 2939.359
a recommendation no recommendation

2937.04 --> 2941.2799999999997
against it

2939.359 --> 2943.2
yeah that's why you felt you need to

2941.28 --> 2946.079
speak up

2943.2 --> 2946.0789999999997
yeah well

2947.76 --> 2952.48
please find some other place to vent

2950.8 --> 2957.8390000000004
your grievances

2952.48 --> 2957.839
then all right

2982.839 --> 2985.839
so

3001.92 --> 3006.96
yeah that's right christopher newton it

3003.839 --> 3010.839
isn't the right place to play victim

3006.96 --> 3012.96
not unless you can actually make a good

3010.839 --> 3016.64
point

3012.96 --> 3020.16
i am not i am not your free

3016.64 --> 3023.359
online lawyer for your grievances

3020.16 --> 3025.68
okay i'm here to

3023.359 --> 3026.72
talk about things explain things answer

3025.68 --> 3030.16
questions

3026.72 --> 3033.359
you know i'm not your freaking lawyer

3030.16 --> 3038.16
you get it not

3033.359 --> 3042.24
you got a problem do something about it

3038.16 --> 3044.319
don't nag to me about it

3042.24 --> 3047.4399999999996
and not do something about it yeah i'm

3044.319 --> 3055.839
not your freaking lawyer

3047.44 --> 3055.839
get your own

3084.079 --> 3088.6400000000003
yeah mark collard i i know the pattern

3086.24 --> 3091.7599999999998
too but i'm just going to ban

3088.64 --> 3094.0789999999997
those out right you know

3091.76 --> 3095.0400000000004
because at some point when that happens

3094.079 --> 3098.079
i will just

3095.04 --> 3101.52
instantly ban whoever knew pops in

3098.079 --> 3105.119
instantly if i don't recognize you oh

3101.52 --> 3108.88
right when i ban something you get in

3105.119 --> 3110.079
quickly okay you're just in a waiting

3108.88 --> 3112.4
road to get banned again

3110.079 --> 3114.0
because if you are indeed going to pick

3112.4 --> 3117.2000000000003
up

3114.0 --> 3120.4
where the banned person left off i'm

3117.2 --> 3125.04
just going to very quickly ban you

3120.4 --> 3128.64
yeah i am not your

3125.04 --> 3128.64
online experiment

3129.2 --> 3133.7599999999998
yeah i am my own online experiment i do

3132.319 --> 3139.839
the experimenting

3133.76 --> 3139.8390000000004
not you in chat get it

3161.359 --> 3164.72
yeah i think it's stupid christopher

3163.119 --> 3166.48
newton

3164.72 --> 3168.24
there's no upward bias and there's no

3166.48 --> 3170.559
downward bias

3168.24 --> 3172.4799999999996
there is no directional bias there's

3170.559 --> 3175.52
just

3172.48 --> 3178.16
vertical passive displacement caused by

3175.52 --> 3182.0
relative density this equilibrium

3178.16 --> 3184.5589999999997
and that's all we need despite somebody

3182.0 --> 3187.04
rambling on for an hour about how that

3184.559 --> 3187.92
is not sufficient and then double speak

3187.04 --> 3190.64
his way through

3187.92 --> 3192.88
how it is but it still it isn't and then

3190.64 --> 3193.7599999999998
completely replace it by something else

3192.88 --> 3195.28
outdated

3193.76 --> 3199.28
mechanics that has been have been

3195.28 --> 3199.28
utterly disproven all that yeah yeah

3201.599 --> 3209.04
but it is just that

3204.64 --> 3212.4
relative density disequilibrium

3209.04 --> 3216.16
of densities of medium and object

3212.4 --> 3219.2000000000003
causing a force passive displacement

3216.16 --> 3223.2
because it always happens

3219.2 --> 3224.8799999999997
it just happens there have to be no

3223.2 --> 3228.16
other influences

3224.88 --> 3231.359
the passive displacement just happens

3228.16 --> 3234.7999999999997
it goes up and down or it stays still if

3231.359 --> 3234.7999999999997
there is no disequilibrium

3235.2 --> 3238.24
and that's how it works

3238.96 --> 3242.7200000000003
and hey if you want to fantasize about

3241.68 --> 3245.839
some

3242.72 --> 3246.72
cause as to why things divide up that

3245.839 --> 3248.48
way

3246.72 --> 3250.72
that's really nice why didn't you write

3248.48 --> 3252.48
a science fiction book about it

3250.72 --> 3253.7599999999998
because as long as you're not going to

3252.48 --> 3256.079
actually

3253.76 --> 3257.76
prove it through empiricism and

3256.079 --> 3260.1600000000003
experiment

3257.76 --> 3262.4
it's just going to be a concept just a

3260.16 --> 3264.5589999999997
fantasy on oh what causes relative

3262.4 --> 3268.079
density this actually

3264.559 --> 3270.079
yeah that's really really cute

3268.079 --> 3272.079
it's no use though there's no use

3270.079 --> 3275.119
actually

3272.079 --> 3275.119
latching on to that

3275.68 --> 3282.799
because if you can't prove it

3279.359 --> 3293.839
and if it disagrees with experiment

3282.799 --> 3293.839
it's wrong

3297.68 --> 3307.839
all right

3309.52 --> 3312.64
was also kind of i will address this for

3312.079 --> 3315.599
a second

3312.64 --> 3316.24
i thought it was very funny that bob at

3315.599 --> 3318.48
one point

3316.24 --> 3319.9599999999996
started to say like oh how dare we say

3318.48 --> 3321.68
that electrostatics and

3319.96 --> 3323.76
[Music]

3321.68 --> 3327.359
and all that doesn't have influence on

3323.76 --> 3330.1600000000003
gases look at this highly charged

3327.359 --> 3332.4
voltage charged person displacing the

3330.16 --> 3332.3999999999996
air

3332.559 --> 3336.2400000000002
and yeah well we never claimed that it

3335.119 --> 3339.28
did not have any

3336.24 --> 3340.799
influence it's just that the influence

3339.28 --> 3344.48
is extremely

3340.799 --> 3348.079
local right it requires a

3344.48 --> 3351.68
solid connection

3348.079 --> 3352.6400000000003
because the gas might be pushed around

3351.68 --> 3355.68
by it

3352.64 --> 3356.319
might cause pressure differentials but

3355.68 --> 3359.9199999999996
it doesn't

3356.319 --> 3362.96
reach through the air electrostatics

3359.92 --> 3365.599
doesn't have a grip over a distance

3362.96 --> 3366.559
unless the energy is just vastly

3365.599 --> 3369.92
increased

3366.559 --> 3370.799
and guess what this world that's not the

3369.92 --> 3373.359
case

3370.799 --> 3374.48
because we're not all just static balls

3373.359 --> 3376.64
of fuzz

3374.48 --> 3378.079
getting shocked and [ __ ] all the time

3376.64 --> 3381.839
right so

3378.079 --> 3385.04
that that affect the electrostatics is

3381.839 --> 3386.88
definitely not what is causing the

3385.04 --> 3391.2
relative density this equilibrium

3386.88 --> 3393.599
situation and the passive displacement

3391.2 --> 3396.799
so it's very easy to refute i try to do

3393.599 --> 3398.799
this every now and then it's just that

3396.799 --> 3401.359
it doesn't seem to matter how many times

3398.799 --> 3403.28
i try to point out these things the

3401.359 --> 3406.5589999999997
difference

3403.28 --> 3409.52
especially just the the local nature

3406.559 --> 3410.6400000000003
of magnetism and electrostatics of all

3409.52 --> 3413.7599999999998
these electric

3410.64 --> 3416.24
based force influences

3413.76 --> 3417.2400000000002
how it's all local it all decreases over

3416.24 --> 3420.9599999999996
distance

3417.24 --> 3421.68
dramatically right so oh oh you're going

3420.96 --> 3425.599
to

3421.68 --> 3428.319
model how that all works

3425.599 --> 3429.04
in the realm in the entire realm with

3428.319 --> 3430.96
the heights

3429.04 --> 3433.839
that the container has and all that

3430.96 --> 3433.839
really that works

3434.0 --> 3439.44
but wouldn't the energy input

3437.2 --> 3441.2799999999997
of the entire setup have to be so

3439.44 --> 3444.4
absurdly dramatic

3441.28 --> 3447.76
in order to have that kind of a reach

3444.4 --> 3449.359
that just to imagine that that would be

3447.76 --> 3450.96
the case in this realm is already

3449.359 --> 3453.119
preposterous

3450.96 --> 3455.599
because we're not constantly in being

3453.119 --> 3461.839
electrified all over the place like that

3455.599 --> 3461.839
it's not what's going on

3472.48 --> 3477.68
a legitimate publication oh we have to

3475.44 --> 3478.64
publicize it we have to write it in a

3477.68 --> 3482.319
paper and then

3478.64 --> 3484.8799999999997
people prolific people that have a lot

3482.319 --> 3486.88
of papers and are respected they have to

3484.88 --> 3489.839
put their stamp on it otherwise it's not

3486.88 --> 3489.839
science you say

3491.04 --> 3497.7599999999998
no science

3494.16 --> 3501.1189999999997
is established through experimentation

3497.76 --> 3504.4
utilizing a hypothesis to

3501.119 --> 3507.92
establish the cause of a natural

3504.4 --> 3507.92
phenomenon effect

3508.16 --> 3514.24
right and it has to be repeatable and

3511.2 --> 3517.2799999999997
anybody should be able to do it

3514.24 --> 3518.64
the simpler the setup the easier to

3517.28 --> 3521.6800000000003
prove it

3518.64 --> 3522.96
the the more solid it becomes as a

3521.68 --> 3526.3999999999996
scientific concept

3522.96 --> 3528.16
as a scientific theory right who gives a

3526.4 --> 3530.4
[ __ ]

3528.16 --> 3531.5989999999997
who wrote it down in the paper and how

3530.4 --> 3535.28
many stickers of

3531.599 --> 3538.319
approval it got the only approval

3535.28 --> 3541.3590000000004
required is that you can personally

3538.319 --> 3544.5589999999997
repeat it and confirm

3541.359 --> 3547.92
or disprove the hypothesis of the

3544.559 --> 3547.92
scientific experiment

3552.64 --> 3556.64
if you don't publish results you're not

3554.559 --> 3559.0400000000004
following the scientific method no

3556.64 --> 3561.359
no that's not true you can literally

3559.04 --> 3564.16
demonstrate it on the spot

3561.359 --> 3565.52
you don't have to publish it you can

3564.16 --> 3568.72
just do it

3565.52 --> 3572.16
yeah scientific method is

3568.72 --> 3576.0
not dependent on

3572.16 --> 3578.96
paper or communication medium

3576.0 --> 3579.28
the only thing that matters is that

3578.96 --> 3582.96
there

3579.28 --> 3583.8390000000004
is an empirical experiment to prove the

3582.96 --> 3586.88
cause of an

3583.839 --> 3590.4
effect a natural phenomenon

3586.88 --> 3594.2400000000002
that anybody could repeat

3590.4 --> 3597.52
to confirm or disprove it

3594.24 --> 3600.9599999999996
you don't require any type of medium

3597.52 --> 3602.799
or like a storage space in some way

3600.96 --> 3604.559
somewhere in the world for it to be

3602.799 --> 3608.64
science you just

3604.559 --> 3610.88
require the experiment and hypothesis

3608.64 --> 3614.0
to be repeatable so that other people

3610.88 --> 3617.359
can do it

3614.0 --> 3620.96
and that can all be verbally relayed

3617.359 --> 3622.64
you don't need paper you don't need a

3620.96 --> 3625.68
book

3622.64 --> 3626.48
you don't need it to sit somewhere in a

3625.68 --> 3630.0
library

3626.48 --> 3633.28
for it to be science it just has to have

3630.0 --> 3634.4
a empirical nature you have to have an

3633.28 --> 3636.96
experiment so that

3634.4 --> 3637.839
you can very manipulate the independent

3636.96 --> 3641.28
variable

3637.839 --> 3642.0
in order to prove or disprove the cause

3641.28 --> 3657.8390000000004
of the effect

3642.0 --> 3657.839
from the hypothesis

3668.839 --> 3671.839
hmm

3686.48 --> 3693.52
oh guys dude notice my rapid balding oh

3690.64 --> 3696.799
my god i'm balding so quickly

3693.52 --> 3699.119
i mean i've been like this for over 20

3696.799 --> 3701.2
years and i'm balding oh no

3699.119 --> 3702.559
why my hair is gone where's all my hair

3701.2 --> 3705.839
oh wait it's right there

3702.559 --> 3708.2400000000002
yeah i know so

3705.839 --> 3708.24
scared

3709.119 --> 3713.04
man i'm so bald it's just terrible look

3711.52 --> 3716.16
at this

3713.04 --> 3727.839
look at this it's terrible

3716.16 --> 3727.839
so intimidated oh

3735.28 --> 3739.039
right mark collard well those women will

3737.359 --> 3755.839
have to go and look for those

3739.039 --> 3755.8390000000004
somewhere else because that ain't here

3758.0 --> 3761.839
hello christopher newton have i

3759.92 --> 3762.88
successfully woke up anyone in your life

3761.839 --> 3766.839
yeah

3762.88 --> 3768.1600000000003
i woke up my dad woke up my friend in

3766.839 --> 3771.2799999999997
america

3768.16 --> 3773.839
and it's just

3771.28 --> 3776.079
slowly taking root because if somebody

3773.839 --> 3778.72
actually has the capacity to really

3776.079 --> 3780.559
figure out the bigger implications

3778.72 --> 3782.0
i've learned that it just takes a lot of

3780.559 --> 3784.559
time if you try to

3782.0 --> 3786.72
ram it in there basically try to

3784.559 --> 3787.76
concession break somebody when they're

3786.72 --> 3789.68
still

3787.76 --> 3792.6400000000003
figuring it out in themselves and

3789.68 --> 3795.0389999999998
especially the emotional parts about it

3792.64 --> 3796.799
that doesn't really work it'll have an

3795.039 --> 3800.4
elastic effect but if you just

3796.799 --> 3803.359
slightly slowly let it seep into them

3800.4 --> 3804.799
fragment by fragment doesn't even have

3803.359 --> 3806.64
to be about

3804.799 --> 3808.48
yeah the geometric orientation of the

3806.64 --> 3810.5589999999997
earth at first you start

3808.48 --> 3812.16
elsewhere you start just with the world

3810.559 --> 3814.1600000000003
you start with the media you start with

3812.16 --> 3816.3999999999996
the proven double speak and lies

3814.16 --> 3818.3999999999996
you start with psychology of people

3816.4 --> 3820.319
defending

3818.4 --> 3822.48
the lies they believe even though you

3820.319 --> 3826.079
could prove it to them their lies

3822.48 --> 3830.2400000000002
start with that and then

3826.079 --> 3831.6800000000003
slowly their foundation their mental

3830.24 --> 3838.8799999999997
foundation

3831.68 --> 3842.16
will prepare itself

3838.88 --> 3844.7200000000003
and yeah it will become viable

3842.16 --> 3846.48
for moving beyond into the bigger

3844.72 --> 3848.24
mechanical picture

3846.48 --> 3849.839
and the realization that the earth is

3848.24 --> 3852.319
flat

3849.839 --> 3853.92
so it just takes a long time really with

3852.319 --> 3857.0389999999998
the important ones

3853.92 --> 3859.92
not just random people you meet

3857.039 --> 3860.7200000000003
it takes time and they will definitely

3859.92 --> 3863.76
resist

3860.72 --> 3866.24
even just instinctual and that's normal

3863.76 --> 3868.559
it just takes a long time so yeah i've

3866.24 --> 3870.8799999999997
definitely woken up people

3868.559 --> 3873.3590000000004
and people have told me they have woken

3870.88 --> 3875.839
up because of me

3873.359 --> 3875.839
as well

3878.4 --> 3882.0
that i played a part in that very proud

3880.72 --> 3885.9199999999996
of it right

3882.0 --> 3889.68
but it's always going to be outnumbered

3885.92 --> 3894.559
by the amount of people that are

3889.68 --> 3896.64
really just never going to wake up

3894.559 --> 3899.76
and that spend a great deal of energy

3896.64 --> 3899.7599999999998
and time resisting

3900.48 --> 3905.039
they're always going to outnumber the

3903.119 --> 3908.319
ones that actually get it

3905.039 --> 3909.2000000000003
because when you get it first thing you

3908.319 --> 3912.319
usually do

3909.2 --> 3915.1189999999997
is kind of retract in silence and just

3912.319 --> 3915.119
let it sink

3915.599 --> 3923.92
because the wisest people out there

3920.16 --> 3928.24
will learn they should have learned that

3923.92 --> 3931.6800000000003
arguing with fools is a waste of time

3928.24 --> 3934.319
and then when you find out a very big

3931.68 --> 3936.24
part of the world is very foolish and

3934.319 --> 3938.72
you figure out how

3936.24 --> 3940.799
then silence is really the only response

3938.72 --> 3944.5589999999997
that is sensible

3940.799 --> 3948.64
until you find a way to basically

3944.559 --> 3952.4
get a grip over those people through

3948.64 --> 3955.68
their lies through their the illusions

3952.4 --> 3956.0
you got to basically figure out how to

3955.68 --> 3958.72
get

3956.0 --> 3959.68
in their world of delusion and then help

3958.72 --> 3962.72
them

3959.68 --> 3963.1189999999997
direct things and then that way you

3962.72 --> 3967.5989999999997
could

3963.119 --> 3967.599
still steer it in some directions

3972.0 --> 3975.039
but all that takes time and you gotta

3974.0 --> 3978.96
have the will

3975.039 --> 3981.5200000000004
to do that

3978.96 --> 3984.7200000000003
you gotta have the will to basically go

3981.52 --> 3987.599
up against people

3984.72 --> 3988.5589999999997
and face all their inner demons and

3987.599 --> 3992.2400000000002
their hidden

3988.559 --> 3994.559
childish psychology that is normally

3992.24 --> 3994.5589999999997
hidden

3995.2 --> 3999.359
on the surface and that's yeah that's

3998.079 --> 4007.8390000000004
quite a task

3999.359 --> 4007.839
not everybody's up to that

4018.839 --> 4021.839
so

4035.039 --> 4041.6800000000003
ah that bobby stills don't don't

4038.48 --> 4046.72
pry like that

4041.68 --> 4050.319
no creation is perfect it is perfect

4046.72 --> 4054.0789999999997
is there consciousness that is

4050.319 --> 4056.64
the issue we can't handle the truth

4054.079 --> 4058.96
it's always the issue there's something

4056.64 --> 4061.1189999999997
we can't handle it's usually because we

4058.96 --> 4063.359
can't handle the truth

4061.119 --> 4064.48
and then people can spend their entire

4063.359 --> 4067.92
lifetime

4064.48 --> 4069.92
time trying to fend off the realization

4067.92 --> 4071.2000000000003
that they've limited themselves because

4069.92 --> 4075.28
they can't handle

4071.2 --> 4077.9199999999996
anymore and they become very proficient

4075.28 --> 4082.079
at building very gratifying to listen to

4077.92 --> 4085.119
stories that justify why they should not

4082.079 --> 4085.119
ascend further

4088.64 --> 4091.839
yeah but tear it awareness is not of

4090.96 --> 4097.12
this world

4091.839 --> 4102.48
don't you get it that's the whole point

4097.12 --> 4105.2789999999995
the creation the design it is perfect

4102.48 --> 4107.12
it's the awareness the fragment the

4105.279 --> 4107.839000000001
fragment of god's consciousness that i

4107.12 --> 4110.88
think we all

4107.839 --> 4113.44
are that is the imperfection

4110.88 --> 4115.92
because it was made as an imperfection

4113.44 --> 4118.48
that was the whole point

4115.92 --> 4120.319
that was the whole point of this giant

4118.48 --> 4123.199
terrestrial

4120.319 --> 4126.319
linear time-based experiment that we're

4123.199 --> 4126.3189999999995
all experiencing

4128.08 --> 4147.839
it is to face the imperfections

4132.239 --> 4147.839
of ourselves

4163.12 --> 4176.64
how the time has flown

4174.56 --> 4179.04
are you the independent variable in the

4176.64 --> 4184.400000000001
experiment

4179.04 --> 4186.319
well i don't know

4184.4 --> 4188.48
maybe calling in an experiment is a

4186.319 --> 4190.319
little complicated

4188.48 --> 4192.239
because i don't know i don't think god

4190.319 --> 4192.799
is trying to establish the cause of an

4192.239 --> 4196.799999999999
effect

4192.799 --> 4199.92
with the creation but maybe i'm wrong

4196.8 --> 4199.92
this is who knows

4200.08 --> 4206.47
hold on be right back

4203.41 --> 4206.47
[Music]

4298.84 --> 4301.84
ugh

4304.32 --> 4311.36
right yeah james mason i get that

4308.48 --> 4311.36
it sounds cool

4313.12 --> 4318.32
but yeah we don't really know what the

4315.44 --> 4318.32
independent well

4320.8 --> 4324.159000000001
the thing is with this experiment though

4322.719 --> 4326.08
is that

4324.159 --> 4327.679
god has to very manipulate the

4326.08 --> 4329.44
independent variable now if the

4327.679 --> 4333.6
independent variable would be

4329.44 --> 4335.759999999999
our conscious spirit

4333.6 --> 4338.4800000000005
then one could argue that he is very

4335.76 --> 4341.76
manipulating us

4338.48 --> 4345.36
in a vast fast

4341.76 --> 4347.6
complex hypothesis so that's kind of

4345.36 --> 4351.36
funny now that i'm thinking about it

4347.6 --> 4351.76
again yeah maybe maybe you could call

4351.36 --> 4356.88
this

4351.76 --> 4360.159000000001
god's experiment

4356.88 --> 4365.12
there is definite hints and

4360.159 --> 4367.759999999999
beliefs one could state that god is

4365.12 --> 4369.12
doing things with us giving us ideas

4367.76 --> 4372.8
contacting us

4369.12 --> 4375.28
responding to prayer so if god does not

4372.8 --> 4376.400000000001
physically intervene in the material

4375.28 --> 4380.5599999999995
things

4376.4 --> 4384.08
he does seem to manipulate

4380.56 --> 4388.080000000001
the the consciousness through people

4384.08 --> 4388.08
so yeah it is arguable

4390.159 --> 4398.96
that maybe creation is god's experiment

4394.0 --> 4401.36
when you think about it like that

4398.96 --> 4404.4
but unfortunately it's going to be god's

4401.36 --> 4408.159
experiment because no man could

4404.4 --> 4411.679
basically repeat the experiment you see

4408.159 --> 4412.96
we can't do that so yeah when it comes

4411.679 --> 4415.12
to scientific method

4412.96 --> 4417.28
the repeatability is kind of critical

4415.12 --> 4419.76
and since no man can basically repeat

4417.28 --> 4422.96
god's experiment

4419.76 --> 4425.76
it's not really a valid experiment by

4422.96 --> 4441.84
earthly standards at least

4425.76 --> 4441.84
but it is interesting to think about

4452.84 --> 4455.84
uh

4461.04 --> 4464.96
uh well bobby steals we can't help that

4463.28 --> 4468.0
you you just refuse

4464.96 --> 4470.96
opening your eyes at every corner

4468.0 --> 4470.96
every time you just

4472.0 --> 4477.6
lie laugh respond

4475.36 --> 4478.4
that's literally you closing off your

4477.6 --> 4482.64
spirit

4478.4 --> 4485.839999999999
do not do not absorb

4482.64 --> 4488.719
so yeah if you close your eyes you're

4485.84 --> 4488.719
not gonna see it

4489.92 --> 4493.1990000000005
do you don't want to see it you don't

4492.159 --> 4497.839999999999
want to let it in

4493.199 --> 4497.839999999999
yeah it's not gonna exist to you

4498.32 --> 4511.84
whatever you're talking about i know

4500.08 --> 4511.84
it's widely applicable

4536.48 --> 4540.718999999999
yes andrew that's that's hilarious

4568.48 --> 4573.44
hmm no fireline but can i never heard of

4571.199 --> 4573.44
that

4578.84 --> 4581.84
hmm

4588.8 --> 4595.52
i did kind of uh

4593.04 --> 4596.159
i didn't read it but there was a movie

4595.52 --> 4598.8
once

4596.159 --> 4601.36
very very long movie about the

4598.8 --> 4604.88
mahabharata

4601.36 --> 4604.88
that i saw when it was pretty young

4604.96 --> 4610.08
i totally didn't get it back then

4608.0 --> 4612.96
like really didn't it actually creeped

4610.08 --> 4616.239
me out but it was fascinating

4612.96 --> 4618.0
the whole thing seemed like a a dream

4616.239 --> 4621.199
vision experience

4618.0 --> 4621.199
it's very intense

4621.6 --> 4637.84
but that book that you're referring to

4623.84 --> 4637.84
i've never heard of that

4657.04 --> 4659.44
hmm

4660.32 --> 4665.84
fifth canto of leather stuff okay

4665.92 --> 4668.2390000000005
well

4669.12 --> 4673.44
i am not much of a reader as you all

4672.159 --> 4675.679
know

4673.44 --> 4679.839999999999
but maybe at some point i will check

4675.679 --> 4679.84
that out

4686.239 --> 4690.639999999999
i don't know i've read so little i think

4688.32 --> 4694.239
that i'm like saving up the reading

4690.64 --> 4696.400000000001
of everything maybe until i'm like 50 or

4694.239 --> 4699.919999999999
60 or something

4696.4 --> 4701.199
because i have postponed and discarded a

4699.92 --> 4703.4400000000005
lot of reading

4701.199 --> 4705.28
i just want to superficially sample it

4703.44 --> 4708.159
and then basically extract the whole

4705.28 --> 4711.679
thing out of people's mind

4708.159 --> 4715.199
is i just assimilate

4711.679 --> 4715.1990000000005
information in another way

4716.88 --> 4721.6
because reading tends to just distract

4719.679 --> 4735.84
me a lot

4721.6 --> 4735.84
it's too linear

4746.84 --> 4749.84
uh

4751.28 --> 4753.5199999999995
oh

4757.04 --> 4763.84
okay more colored

4764.88 --> 4768.08
i hope you'll be all right

4772.4 --> 4778.799999999999
if yeah if you want to share about it

4775.6 --> 4781.679
over skype i'm up for a chat i'll keep

4778.8 --> 4787.1990000000005
it private if you want

4781.679 --> 4787.1990000000005
of course i will but yeah

4787.6 --> 4791.84
yeah stay strong

4809.92 --> 4819.84
where's that coming from

4854.719 --> 4860.32
ot old testament right new testament oh

4858.56 --> 4861.360000000001
that's been too much disconnected from

4860.32 --> 4863.679
it right

4861.36 --> 4866.32
well wrote for sen hobbit it's it's

4863.679 --> 4867.12
really complicated every time that [ __ ]

4866.32 --> 4870.48
comes up

4867.12 --> 4872.8
and the issues and all that but yeah old

4870.48 --> 4875.839999999999
testament to me

4872.8 --> 4879.92
is almost like a puzzle book

4875.84 --> 4882.96
because it seemed there

4879.92 --> 4888.32
is just a lot of testing of the

4882.96 --> 4892.4800000000005
reader going on like to see

4888.32 --> 4895.04
are you getting what's going on here

4892.48 --> 4895.839999999999
do you understand what this really is

4895.04 --> 4898.56
despite

4895.84 --> 4900.56
how it's being described and how the

4898.56 --> 4903.679
involved parties think about it

4900.56 --> 4904.719
right it's like this giant puzzle test

4903.679 --> 4908.159
to see

4904.719 --> 4911.44
whether you have the natural

4908.159 --> 4913.04
god spirit of recognition in you the

4911.44 --> 4916.239
true essence

4913.04 --> 4919.199
that is the real reflector

4916.239 --> 4919.5199999999995
i i've always felt the old testament is

4919.199 --> 4923.5199999999995
a

4919.52 --> 4923.52
big test for the spirit

4924.88 --> 4929.28
because if you have issues with your

4928.159 --> 4933.28
spirit

4929.28 --> 4935.199
then that will reveal itself when

4933.28 --> 4937.12
you go through the old testament because

4935.199 --> 4940.159
certain things

4937.12 --> 4940.719
you won't recognize you won't recognize

4940.159 --> 4944.0
like

4940.719 --> 4946.88
this is wrong or this is actually

4944.0 --> 4948.159
the overarching situation happening

4946.88 --> 4951.28
because i can

4948.159 --> 4954.719
see that this is not entirely com

4951.28 --> 4958.239
this is not correct like

4954.719 --> 4961.6
old testament to me is a puzzle book

4958.239 --> 4964.638999999999
it's a giant test test of the spirit

4961.6 --> 4964.639
and that's how i see it

4968.719 --> 4972.159
like i think you could actually use the

4971.28 --> 4978.159
old testament

4972.159 --> 4978.159
as a as a test book

4978.239 --> 4982.718999999999
make somebody read it see how they

4981.199 --> 4984.719
reflect upon it

4982.719 --> 4986.639
have to be pretty well studied in it to

4984.719 --> 4988.4
see every part of it you have to already

4986.639 --> 4989.84
know what are the where are the pitfalls

4988.4 --> 4990.879999999999
what are people typically going to

4989.84 --> 4994.8
respond with and

4990.88 --> 4995.76
why and then you can literally let them

4994.8 --> 4997.76
read it

4995.76 --> 4999.52
talk to you about it and then you can

4997.76 --> 5002.08
size them up based on

4999.52 --> 5003.679
how they reflected upon the old

5002.08 --> 5006.88
testament

5003.679 --> 5015.84
i think that this is the most valuable

5006.88 --> 5015.84
application of it

5026.08 --> 5031.199
are the elites taking our test and

5028.159 --> 5034.32
punishing if we don't learn

5031.199 --> 5037.919999999999
maybe are they doing it

5034.32 --> 5042.32
or are they just going by the system

5037.92 --> 5044.2390000000005
that actually kind of enforces that

5042.32 --> 5047.04
and they're just doing as they're kind

5044.239 --> 5047.04
of instructed

5048.0 --> 5057.84
it's tough to say

5059.04 --> 5064.639
okay okay that's a

5062.32 --> 5066.4
a pretty dramatic conclusion there

5064.639 --> 5069.76
completely overlooking

5066.4 --> 5070.638999999999
everything i just said glad you just

5069.76 --> 5074.8
revealed that

5070.639 --> 5077.84
you certainly don't have that spirit

5074.8 --> 5079.92
system in you to recognize it

5077.84 --> 5081.84
otherwise you wouldn't have said this

5079.92 --> 5085.84
this is a very superficial

5081.84 --> 5085.84
interpretation of the whole thing

5097.12 --> 5102.96
uh no clutch bears no

5100.4 --> 5102.96
it's not

5104.639 --> 5115.4400000000005
again another trap see you're

5112.4 --> 5115.44
you're trying to

5116.32 --> 5122.159
make a universal purpose out of it it's

5119.04 --> 5123.199
a test book it's a test book for you to

5122.159 --> 5127.36
recognize

5123.199 --> 5130.5599999999995
what is what

5127.36 --> 5132.08
it's not about the struggle between

5130.56 --> 5136.2390000000005
bloodlines

5132.08 --> 5139.44
or the nephilim or

5136.239 --> 5142.718999999999
what is god when is it not god

5139.44 --> 5145.5199999999995
it's about distinguishment

5142.719 --> 5149.199
from the spirit in reflection upon the

5145.52 --> 5149.1990000000005
story that's my opinion about it

5150.639 --> 5155.84
can you recognize the essence

5165.36 --> 5169.599999999999
right because it's all also about things

5168.0 --> 5173.12
about

5169.6 --> 5176.2390000000005
corruption stuck within glory

5173.12 --> 5180.84
glory stuck within corruption

5176.239 --> 5184.08
all these multi-tier

5180.84 --> 5186.96
complications where the spirit can be at

5184.08 --> 5187.84
from several perspectives that is the

5186.96 --> 5190.2390000000005
real puzzle

5187.84 --> 5193.28
in my opinion that's over the long run

5190.239 --> 5193.28
what i got out of it

5193.52 --> 5200.4800000000005
you can't just say this is the right one

5196.96 --> 5202.8
that is the bad one it doesn't work like

5200.48 --> 5202.799999999999
that

5203.36 --> 5206.159
that's the point

5209.04 --> 5225.84
at least that's how i see it

5234.08 --> 5236.4
right

5237.199 --> 5241.5199999999995
i'm glad you're you're starting to it's

5239.92 --> 5244.8
starting to

5241.52 --> 5247.76
seep through it is a very

5244.8 --> 5249.92
i call it a multi-dimensional book for a

5247.76 --> 5253.12
good reason

5249.92 --> 5254.0
i i it's not just a fancy word i found

5253.12 --> 5256.08
to

5254.0 --> 5257.84
basically tag it with and sound all

5256.08 --> 5260.159
special and all that no

5257.84 --> 5260.88
i call the bible a multi-dimensional

5260.159 --> 5264.839999999999
book

5260.88 --> 5267.84
i mean multi-dimensional

5264.84 --> 5267.84
book

5268.4 --> 5275.199
really not just

5271.76 --> 5278.320000000001
a conceptual description

5275.199 --> 5280.48
or a metaphor something really

5278.32 --> 5281.599999999999
deep about it and i see the old

5280.48 --> 5284.879999999999
testament as a

5281.6 --> 5287.52
reflector of the spirit

5284.88 --> 5289.1990000000005
it's a test it's the first test you read

5287.52 --> 5292.0
the old testament it's the first

5289.199 --> 5293.44
test how much of god's spirit do you

5292.0 --> 5296.239
really have in you

5293.44 --> 5297.36
oh you're going to cross-reference it

5296.239 --> 5300.08
with the rule

5297.36 --> 5302.08
said there well then you're already gone

5300.08 --> 5305.92
wrong you've already gone astray

5302.08 --> 5305.92
it's about the pure response

5306.96 --> 5311.6
not according to rules given to you the

5309.76 --> 5316.159000000001
pure response

5311.6 --> 5318.96
the unspoken rules the spirit the real

5316.159 --> 5318.96
real spirit

5321.04 --> 5337.84
well that's how i take it anyway

5348.0 --> 5351.84
if i didn't want an awakening you

5350.08 --> 5354.08
probably wouldn't know about flat earth

5351.84 --> 5354.08
yet

5355.36 --> 5364.88
well i would potentially be a baller

5361.36 --> 5367.28
can you imagine that me being

5364.88 --> 5367.92
like a baller hanging around with flat

5367.28 --> 5372.08
earthers

5367.92 --> 5375.1990000000005
ridiculing them on arwin level

5372.08 --> 5377.199
because i couldn't handle that the

5375.199 --> 5378.638999999999
belief i like to hang on about the earth

5377.199 --> 5379.599999999999
being a ball in outer space and

5378.639 --> 5382.639
spaceships and

5379.6 --> 5384.4800000000005
futurism that i couldn't handle the

5382.639 --> 5385.12
notion that that might be purely

5384.48 --> 5389.839999999999
fictional

5385.12 --> 5389.84
in in our collective minds gathering

5390.08 --> 5394.4
yeah i might be a baller just like some

5393.199 --> 5396.879999999999
of these guys

5394.4 --> 5397.759999999999
that like to come over in my chat and

5396.88 --> 5399.84
hang around

5397.76 --> 5402.159000000001
with the flat earthers even though they

5399.84 --> 5406.2390000000005
will never let go of the ball

5402.159 --> 5408.799999999999
they're trying to find out

5406.239 --> 5411.12
that they're trying to find out like how

5408.8 --> 5413.6
can these people

5411.12 --> 5415.12
not believe it's a ball then they face

5413.6 --> 5417.6
the arguments

5415.12 --> 5420.32
face their responses their rebuttals and

5417.6 --> 5422.08
then their inner mechanic goes

5420.32 --> 5423.92
and then they forget about it again and

5422.08 --> 5426.08
they just red herring into something

5423.92 --> 5427.679
else or start nitpicking about some

5426.08 --> 5429.92
mechanical detail deep in their

5427.679 --> 5432.84
presupposition

5429.92 --> 5434.88
and that's what happens i would be like

5432.84 --> 5438.96
that

5434.88 --> 5442.639
i'm very glad i'm not i used to be that

5438.96 --> 5447.12
i used to be that before the internet

5442.639 --> 5447.12
yeah i used to be that

5447.199 --> 5450.879999999999
very happy i didn't became that on the

5450.159 --> 5454.5599999999995
internet

5450.88 --> 5459.1990000000005
very very happy i swore

5454.56 --> 5459.1990000000005
off that kind of behavior before

5461.6 --> 5465.360000000001
yeah before that ever took place

5474.8 --> 5478.639
what would an arwen baller be doing

5476.639 --> 5481.84
right now i think i would be writing a

5478.639 --> 5482.32
whole bunch of science fiction books to

5481.84 --> 5485.92
try and

5482.32 --> 5486.5599999999995
spellbound everybody in my conception of

5485.92 --> 5489.92
how the

5486.56 --> 5491.52
heliocentric model is which is extremely

5489.92 --> 5495.28
elaborate

5491.52 --> 5498.0
which is revolutionary

5495.28 --> 5500.5599999999995
as in me as i'm kind of still doing as a

5498.0 --> 5502.0
flat earther correcting heliocentric

5500.56 --> 5504.639
garbage assertions

5502.0 --> 5506.639
trying to fix the dream i'd be doing

5504.639 --> 5508.0
that and i'd be publicizing all over the

5506.639 --> 5511.4400000000005
place

5508.0 --> 5511.44
because what else can you do

5513.04 --> 5518.0
and i'd be hating on nathan oakley

5516.239 --> 5520.32
i'd be like i don't like this guy he has

5518.0 --> 5522.239
no respect for the integrity of what i'm

5520.32 --> 5524.4
doing

5522.239 --> 5525.5199999999995
he's only interested in pointing out

5524.4 --> 5527.599999999999
it's not a ball

5525.52 --> 5533.84
i can't do anything with that that would

5527.6 --> 5533.84
be my attitude if i was a baller

5537.44 --> 5547.839999999999
but i'm not

5552.159 --> 5560.4
i think he's insane because of cognitive

5555.04 --> 5562.88
dissonance what

5560.4 --> 5565.92
i wouldn't be the rumpus for sure well

5562.88 --> 5568.400000000001
not like the rumpus

5565.92 --> 5571.28
i'd be embarrassed for the rumpus from

5568.4 --> 5571.28
that perspective

5573.36 --> 5577.92
but i might actually do something

5575.44 --> 5577.919999999999
similar

5578.0 --> 5583.28
and probably scatter gun the [ __ ] out of

5581.12 --> 5584.4
the place with a whole bunch of

5583.28 --> 5589.84
arguments that

5584.4 --> 5589.839999999999
haven't even hit hit the scene yet

5590.159 --> 5597.04
because i'm very good at making

5593.199 --> 5597.36
up heliocentric reifying just so stories

5597.04 --> 5599.84
i'm

5597.36 --> 5600.48
really good at it i used to be extremely

5599.84 --> 5603.360000000001
good at it

5600.48 --> 5605.5199999999995
it was a huge obstacle to overcome

5603.36 --> 5607.44
because i was so good at it i could not

5605.52 --> 5610.88
believe

5607.44 --> 5612.96
that it could be anything else

5610.88 --> 5614.159000000001
because i could literally just fill it

5612.96 --> 5616.08
in and it would work

5614.159 --> 5618.4
it would work better than others

5616.08 --> 5620.32
people's explanations and conceptions

5618.4 --> 5631.839999999999
about the ball earth

5620.32 --> 5631.84
i'm just a better baller than you

5642.84 --> 5645.84
um

5656.84 --> 5659.84
hmm

5670.88 --> 5677.36
right well mark-colored science

5674.08 --> 5678.96
is a religion for a lot of people

5677.36 --> 5680.4
it's the religion that they are in

5678.96 --> 5684.96
denial of is

5680.4 --> 5687.199
is a religion it's a mystery religion

5684.96 --> 5688.56
what is a mystery religion a mystery

5687.199 --> 5691.5199999999995
religion

5688.56 --> 5692.159000000001
is a religion that people that believe

5691.52 --> 5696.639
in it

5692.159 --> 5698.239
don't realize it's a religion

5696.639 --> 5700.0
there's always mysteries there's

5698.239 --> 5703.36
unresolved things there's more

5700.0 --> 5706.0
to come so in a way it is based

5703.36 --> 5707.759999999999
on the same thing that makes

5706.0 --> 5709.76
storytelling appealing

5707.76 --> 5711.119000000001
you hear a story you get into the story

5709.76 --> 5712.56
then the story ends

5711.119 --> 5714.239
and people are like oh i want to hear

5712.56 --> 5717.84
the rest of the story

5714.239 --> 5719.5199999999995
that fantastical enthusiasm about what

5717.84 --> 5723.04
twist is to come

5719.52 --> 5726.400000000001
is what keeps people bound

5723.04 --> 5728.32
into the mystery religion right

5726.4 --> 5730.4
it's a storytelling that just saw

5728.32 --> 5732.719
stories and more to come

5730.4 --> 5735.119
that is what makes it appealing and that

5732.719 --> 5739.52
is also what makes it

5735.119 --> 5739.5199999999995
effective as a religion

5740.239 --> 5743.678999999999
because there is satisfaction to be

5743.04 --> 5747.44
gained

5743.679 --> 5750.719
by following it within fantasy

5747.44 --> 5750.719
within the imagination

5754.8 --> 5757.92
that should be my slogan better baller

5757.36 --> 5760.639
than you

5757.92 --> 5763.4400000000005
that's hilarious julio patton it's a

5760.639 --> 5765.36
little aggro though

5763.44 --> 5766.799999999999
i i wouldn't really want to advertise

5765.36 --> 5771.119
with that

5766.8 --> 5785.84
even though it's true

5771.119 --> 5785.839999999999
oh look what i'm doing

5796.84 --> 5799.84
hmm

5811.44 --> 5817.759999999999
right i think i'm gonna round out the

5814.56 --> 5817.76
show it's a little early

5818.08 --> 5825.199
but i still wanna

5821.76 --> 5831.280000000001
do some other stuff and yeah i think i

5825.199 --> 5831.28
put down a whole lot of conversation

5832.96 --> 5836.0
i think that i'm probably gonna have to

5834.719 --> 5840.4800000000005
watch back to figure

5836.0 --> 5842.48
yeah to remember everything i said

5840.48 --> 5843.919999999999
because i put down pretty heavy

5842.48 --> 5845.839999999999
structures and ideas

5843.92 --> 5848.159
and then i kind of forget about it right

5845.84 --> 5848.8
after because it's not something that i

5848.159 --> 5852.0
want to

5848.8 --> 5853.84
uphold in place in my mind constantly

5852.0 --> 5855.6
i don't need it to because i'm not

5853.84 --> 5858.96
afraid of losing

5855.6 --> 5860.88
it it is there it is there for me to

5858.96 --> 5864.159
automatically bump into and

5860.88 --> 5865.76
realize once again whenever the time is

5864.159 --> 5868.08
there

5865.76 --> 5870.4800000000005
so i typically forget about a lot of the

5868.08 --> 5872.48
things that i say

5870.48 --> 5875.04
because it's not something i keep

5872.48 --> 5877.919999999999
memorized in my head in order to

5875.04 --> 5880.32
reference every time no it's just

5877.92 --> 5880.84
something i see as a natural fact it

5880.32 --> 5884.08
just

5880.84 --> 5887.52
manifests it manifests because it

5884.08 --> 5890.639
is true and that's how i come

5887.52 --> 5892.4800000000005
back to the same ideas not because i

5890.639 --> 5894.4800000000005
memorized them because i got it written

5892.48 --> 5897.44
down somewhere but because i just

5894.48 --> 5898.5599999999995
come to the same conclusions naturally

5897.44 --> 5900.799999999999
every time

5898.56 --> 5903.04
that's what i'm relying on i'm not

5900.8 --> 5906.0
relying on my memory

5903.04 --> 5906.639
in order to attain knowledge i'm relying

5906.0 --> 5910.8
on my

5906.639 --> 5915.1990000000005
insight and my ability to in the moment

5910.8 --> 5917.679
figure things out for my knowledge

5915.199 --> 5920.5599999999995
that is the source of my knowledge not

5917.679 --> 5920.56
memorization

5923.36 --> 5927.44
and it's working out great i never

5926.48 --> 5931.5199999999995
thought it would work

5927.44 --> 5934.719
so well like 20 years ago i did this

5931.52 --> 5937.119000000001
but i was stumbling around a lot

5934.719 --> 5938.0
i had a lot of ego issues that would get

5937.119 --> 5940.08
in the way

5938.0 --> 5941.84
of the natural formation of these

5940.08 --> 5945.04
insights

5941.84 --> 5948.159000000001
and now it's working so much better it's

5945.04 --> 5953.84
it's becoming second nature

5948.159 --> 5953.839999999999
maybe first nature i'm very happy with

5964.84 --> 5967.84
that

5969.6 --> 5978.08
no no it's not knowledge is not memory

5973.84 --> 5982.159000000001
knowledge is inside knowing

5978.08 --> 5985.84
not not memorizing not memory

5982.159 --> 5989.04
knowing understanding

5985.84 --> 5990.159000000001
when does knowing happen in the moment

5989.04 --> 5992.719
of realization

5990.159 --> 5994.719
when does understanding happen upon

5992.719 --> 5998.719
moment of confrontation

5994.719 --> 6002.639
it's a moment it's not something i store

5998.719 --> 6004.159
actively cycles to be repeated over and

6002.639 --> 6007.04
over again so it becomes all

6004.159 --> 6009.119
railroaded just doing things

6007.04 --> 6011.5199999999995
automatically do is does that over time

6009.119 --> 6011.5199999999995
anyway

6011.76 --> 6017.679
now knowledge is understanding knowledge

6014.88 --> 6017.679
is insight

6020.32 --> 6025.599999999999
memorization is well

6023.679 --> 6027.36
memory becomes really useful when you

6025.6 --> 6029.92
have to dig into something really

6027.36 --> 6032.5599999999995
complex especially for the first time

6029.92 --> 6033.679
because then you do need your memory for

6032.56 --> 6035.76
all these things

6033.679 --> 6036.8
that are kind of fresh to you kind of

6035.76 --> 6038.4800000000005
new

6036.8 --> 6040.2390000000005
and then it's good to have them all

6038.48 --> 6042.959999999999
memorized in that moment and

6040.239 --> 6045.599999999999
i do feel the strain when i ate that one

6042.96 --> 6048.56
of the reasons why i don't really

6045.6 --> 6050.2390000000005
oh look at this new book i'm immediately

6048.56 --> 6052.2390000000005
going to read this new book no

6050.239 --> 6055.44
you know why because then i would have

6052.239 --> 6057.28
to utilize much more

6055.44 --> 6060.4
it's much more of a strain to me to dig

6057.28 --> 6060.4
into new materials

6061.199 --> 6064.719
because i have not specifically trained

6063.52 --> 6068.159000000001
it i've trained my

6064.719 --> 6070.639
insight my clarity

6068.159 --> 6071.839999999999
sharpness that's my training not

6070.639 --> 6075.679
memorization

6071.84 --> 6078.88
and that's why basically i'm like a

6075.679 --> 6081.679
word cook

6078.88 --> 6082.719
kind of like midnight dinner i can make

6081.679 --> 6085.36
anything

6082.719 --> 6086.88
if you have the ingredients just bring

6085.36 --> 6089.92
it i'll make it

6086.88 --> 6092.639
it'll work that's my style

6089.92 --> 6094.88
that's what i do i don't have this

6092.639 --> 6097.119
library of books that i consider

6094.88 --> 6098.08
this is my precious knowledge that i

6097.119 --> 6100.639
have to

6098.08 --> 6101.679
know by heart and then it reflects my

6100.639 --> 6105.119
value

6101.679 --> 6106.32
no that's not what i do take whatever's

6105.119 --> 6108.239
coming

6106.32 --> 6110.48
and then i do something with it right

6108.239 --> 6113.28
there right then

6110.48 --> 6114.799999999999
that's my style that's my ability that's

6113.28 --> 6117.5199999999995
where i've grown my skill

6114.8 --> 6117.52
to do that

6119.28 --> 6123.759999999999
right so i am gonna round out now thanks

6122.48 --> 6125.678999999999

6174.32 --> 6178.639
explained

6174.96 --> 6181.199
way before it literally helps

6178.639 --> 6182.0
immediately it helps in my energy level

6181.199 --> 6185.5199999999995
literally

6182.0 --> 6187.6
like yeah giving me money is like

6185.52 --> 6190.080000000001
literally increasing energy level

6187.6 --> 6193.52
palpable sounds a little silly but it's

6190.08 --> 6196.159
true so keep that in mind increased

6193.52 --> 6199.6
performance if that's what you want

6196.159 --> 6201.119
it's gonna have to be finances but

6199.6 --> 6203.679
yeah you guys have been great and i
