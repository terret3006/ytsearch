[Music]

40.0 --> 48.29
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

44.0 --> 50.269
early-bird number 187 I'm your host

48.29 --> 52.22
Arwen and before we start the show

50.269 --> 55.4
please don't forget to share it on any

52.22 --> 57.14
platform you see fit and if you haven't

55.4 --> 58.91
already subscribe to my channel and hit

57.14 --> 60.559
the bell notification so you know when

58.91 --> 65.39
I'm going live which is normally 2:00

60.559 --> 71.33
p.m. amsterdam time so today the weather

65.39 --> 73.789
is it's nice it's it's really warmed but

71.33 --> 77.69
it's kind of cloudy as well but it's

73.789 --> 79.729
still warm despite the clouds and the

77.69 --> 82.729
Sun comes through every now and then and

79.729 --> 86.06
then it's like really summer warm it's a

82.729 --> 90.28
nice day there's like kids playing

86.06 --> 92.57000000000001
outside they're now on a break

90.28 --> 96.38
frolicking around down there playing

92.57 --> 104.38999999999999
with stuff running and screaming all

96.38 --> 109.15899999999999
over the place so yeah it's been a lot

104.39 --> 113.21000000000001
of trolls in chat let's see what real

109.159 --> 115.369
people are here a righteous force was in

113.21 --> 118.25
the early and yeah I gave him a wrench I

115.369 --> 128.079
think he deserved it Steve

118.25 --> 128.079
ATM over Mukul Major Tom glacier Steve

130.04 --> 140.25
x3 20 yeah good to see you all

136.98 --> 143.88
I have no Casas or anything today I do

140.25 --> 147.33
have tea I kind of did have tumeric

143.88 --> 152.46
coffee but I kind of drank it all

147.33 --> 155.34
it was too good I made it let's say 20

152.46 --> 157.83
minutes before the show started but I

155.34 --> 160.49
just took a sip and it was too good I

157.83 --> 167.28
did what I said that I did yesterday

160.49 --> 170.91
that I was gonna do yesterday I put in

167.28 --> 174.0
the coffee maker in between the two

170.91 --> 179.07
scoops of coffee powder I put like a

174.0 --> 183.0
pretty big spoon of turmeric powder in

179.07 --> 186.66
between the scoops and then made coffee

183.0 --> 189.84
with that and it worked out exactly as I

186.66 --> 191.46
thought it would it's amazing the weird

189.84 --> 196.49
thing is you didn't even see it

191.46 --> 196.49
it just had like a spicy flavor to it

196.76 --> 202.38
very interesting and the funny thing is

200.1 --> 207.06
normally when I drink coffee and this is

202.38 --> 210.81
almost every single time I it it has a

207.06 --> 213.63
pretty big impact on my stomach not

210.81 --> 217.29
painfully so but I feel it and this time

213.63 --> 221.51
with the tumeric extract in it it's part

217.29 --> 224.04
of the coffee I didn't get that at all

221.51 --> 229.48999999999998
so this was a very interesting

224.04 --> 232.41
experience and I like this kind of thing

229.49 --> 234.33
experimenting with the basics basic

232.41 --> 237.959
things you do and then see if you can

234.33 --> 242.01000000000002
like add some healthy herb or spice some

237.959 --> 244.5
way things that you never thought of

242.01 --> 250.04
before it might work out Mike the taste

244.5 --> 250.04
might go together well so

250.349 --> 257.699
oh dear ten sugars with your coffee you

255.569 --> 261.44
mean you have some coffee with your

257.699 --> 267.15000000000003
sugar that's not very healthy dude

261.44 --> 270.12
that's like pure nicotine and sugar

267.15 --> 276.06
combined is just terrible it's very

270.12 --> 278.25
aggressive to your system I do have to

276.06 --> 284.099
admit that I do use sugar in my coffee

278.25 --> 289.02
but it's organic it's not so refined

284.099 --> 293.099
it's not white at all and I just take

289.02 --> 298.90999999999997
like two small scoops that two more

293.099 --> 301.919
small spoons not teaspoons but yeah I

298.91 --> 306.949
used to take a lot more and I loved it

301.919 --> 310.25
like oh yeah sugar rage basically but I

306.949 --> 314.33000000000004
can take as much sugar as I used to

310.25 --> 314.33
it's just not good for me

322.44 --> 329.25
right so hello Billy Wazza I know you

328.18 --> 332.44
know I know

329.25 --> 337.81
captain caps-lock or cat Payne caps lock

332.44 --> 346.84
of course David Reed Obama clad gator

337.81 --> 349.56
fish so yeah yesterday I had the game

346.84 --> 352.65999999999997
although unexpectedly it wasn't

349.56 --> 357.52
downstairs here after all it was still

352.66 --> 360.36
over it one of my gamers place where we

357.52 --> 364.0
go most of the times it's a very nice

360.36 --> 366.61
broad room with the white table and and

364.0 --> 368.47
cats always like that but they

366.61 --> 372.19
apparently are gonna move to some new

368.47 --> 374.08000000000004
location so kind of stuff going on

372.19 --> 378.94
apparently that I just found out

374.08 --> 380.91999999999996
yesterday talking and I wonder what

378.94 --> 383.62
their new place is gonna be like I hope

380.92 --> 386.5
it's gonna be good but the game was good

383.62 --> 389.17
very much combat it's weird because

386.5 --> 392.14
eventually you had the the gamers were

389.17 --> 394.72
almost kind of bored with it that's

392.14 --> 396.94
because they were yeah they just kept on

394.72 --> 401.05
talking and one of the players who was

396.94 --> 404.92
actually there like was not involved in

401.05 --> 408.22
the combat so I guess that but it was

404.92 --> 410.68
still very good and things did work out

408.22 --> 412.21000000000004
interestingly and yeah they're getting

410.68 --> 417.37
out of hand because they basically

412.21 --> 420.58
overplayed their hand against the force

417.37 --> 425.02
which at which with with which they

420.58 --> 427.51
technically are at a stalemate and they

425.02 --> 430.57
did get somebody killed from the other

427.51 --> 433.36
side in their devious exploration

430.57 --> 437.02
attempt and it's gonna be revenge

433.36 --> 439.03000000000003
against that and the game yesterday

437.02 --> 440.79999999999995
pretty much ended at that that they were

439.03 --> 445.21
back in the tavern escaped with a

440.8 --> 449.2
teleport and then outside things started

445.21 --> 449.95
to explode so yeah that's very promising

449.2 --> 452.34999999999997
for next

449.95 --> 456.03
it's gonna be fun for me as a game

452.35 --> 456.03000000000003
master because I can wreak havoc and

458.13 --> 465.43
make things more interesting because

462.54 --> 468.25
usually in their city or in their

465.43 --> 470.53000000000003
village things are super stable because

468.25 --> 473.74
everybody knows that they're there and

470.53 --> 477.94
they're crazy like my players as

473.74 --> 481.75
characters are pretty extremists in

477.94 --> 485.44
their principles which is pretty chaotic

481.75 --> 487.9
neutral can even get evil at times it's

485.44 --> 494.05
their very dubious characters but

487.9 --> 496.45
they're control freaks it's it's a weird

494.05 --> 498.49
chaotic and predictable dynamic group

496.45 --> 502.36
and they're very powerful and they grow

498.49 --> 506.5
very quickly so everybody's just like oh

502.36 --> 509.08000000000004
well we got the champion so everything

506.5 --> 511.48
will be all right you know somebody dies

509.08 --> 513.97
then they could probably even be

511.48 --> 515.5
resurrected through the priests power of

513.97 --> 520.8100000000001
one of the characters it was just very

515.5 --> 523.69
strong by now can do that and but yeah

520.81 --> 527.6199999999999
these elves these dark elf the drow are

523.69 --> 532.0600000000001
very strong as well they're like yeah on

527.62 --> 536.35
par the champions on the on the drow

532.06 --> 538.63
side the the Queen and the mages they

536.35 --> 539.53
are stronger on average than the players

538.63 --> 542.74
aren't right now

539.53 --> 545.62
they're real Deb hi champions like the

542.74 --> 547.27
biggest ones on the board on the youth

545.62 --> 551.14
on the continent are pretty much all

547.27 --> 553.63
level 20 and yeah if the players keep on

551.14 --> 556.24
going they will to become on that level

553.63 --> 559.42
and then like really freaky [ __ ] starts

556.24 --> 563.74
to happen into dimensionals and Souren

559.42 --> 565.42
esque events or like big dark forces

563.74 --> 568.03
start to get involved because otherwise

565.42 --> 570.2099999999999
it's just no challenge anymore it has to

568.03 --> 570.2099999999999
happen

572.139 --> 578.99
but yeah it's good and they're gonna

575.899 --> 583.029
deal with some very serious strategical

578.99 --> 587.54
combatants with Wizards that cast spells

583.029 --> 590.72
in a smart way and then that don't that

587.54 --> 593.899
are not sitting duck targets and very

590.72 --> 597.94
very refined skilled fighters that could

593.899 --> 601.579
just deal insane strategical blows and

597.94 --> 603.44
that so yeah and so do the players by

601.579 --> 606.5889999999999
the way like seriously the fighters we

603.44 --> 609.5600000000001
have left like these amplified power

606.589 --> 614.75
swords that just do these insane

609.56 --> 616.399
critical hits that you could compare it

614.75 --> 618.98
to basically when they hit like that

616.399 --> 622.93
they've with one blow they just chopped

618.98 --> 627.8290000000001
down a huge tree it's that powerful

622.93 --> 630.62
yeah the heavy heavy magical radiating

627.829 --> 632.649
powerful stuff it's very high magic and

630.62 --> 636.5
they have it they and they paid for it

632.649 --> 639.079
millions millions of gold worth of

636.5 --> 639.589
treasures and [ __ ] which is all over the

639.079 --> 642.709
place

639.589 --> 645.0790000000001
from the old Empire of course because

642.709 --> 653.2399999999999
the entire world is just basically a

645.079 --> 657.189
giant pile of gold anyway yeah D&D it

653.24 --> 657.189
was fun had a lot of fun

661.6 --> 667.5400000000001
oh and yes I did kind of take a brain

664.57 --> 670.63
force not today but before the game

667.54 --> 672.55
yesterday and that did really help that

670.63 --> 675.31
was funny because I tend to get very

672.55 --> 677.74
distracted just from the players talking

675.31 --> 681.1899999999999
and me trying to keep oversight and

677.74 --> 683.35
being just yeah comedic stuff

681.19 --> 685.2700000000001
distracting me and the brain force did

683.35 --> 687.4300000000001
actually helped me a little extra to

685.27 --> 692.04
keep things on track it was very useful

687.43 --> 694.9599999999999
I might try that again and to be fair I

692.04 --> 698.9499999999999
always said brain forces for something

694.96 --> 703.0300000000001
when you really need big attention big

698.95 --> 705.6700000000001
focus and when I do the game especially

703.03 --> 709.17
in more complex combat situations where

705.67 --> 711.8199999999999
I have to overlook several smart

709.17 --> 716.77
strategical people basically do a

711.82 --> 719.5600000000001
virtual chess game yeah that that does

716.77 --> 723.28
definitely qualifies for using that so I

719.56 --> 726.1899999999999
might actually use it for that and if

723.28 --> 729.1899999999999
I'd use it like I did then I'll be able

726.19 --> 733.2600000000001
to use it for the next two years because

729.19 --> 740.7700000000001
there's that many capsules in the bottle

733.26 --> 744.1
I'm gonna take one every be two weeks or

740.77 --> 756.39
something yeah could do very long time

744.1 --> 756.39
anyway yeah what else happened

759.53 --> 767.72
I got a lot of trolls I had the whole

764.72 --> 768.9200000000001
Brenda situation yesterday yeah what did

767.72 --> 772.64
you guys think about the Hangout I

768.92 --> 775.25
thought it was really cool I totally

772.64 --> 778.97
caught Brenda so red-handed many many

775.25 --> 782.69
times and it really played out nicely

778.97 --> 785.78
was very satisfied about it and I got a

782.69 --> 788.57
lot of good comments also for a change

785.78 --> 791.06
so I might do something like that again

788.57 --> 795.8900000000001
I think that if ballers think they can

791.06 --> 798.29
take me on I'll do it like I have be

795.89 --> 800.87
polite but if things get like really

798.29 --> 803.4499999999999
devious I will eventually become a

800.87 --> 808.49
little shouty just like Nathan does but

803.45 --> 812.7800000000001
I'll try to only do it really on the

808.49 --> 815.45
right moment to truly emphasize the the

812.78 --> 817.37
idiocy in the error and not just yeah I

815.45 --> 819.38
know where this is going so I'm already

817.37 --> 828.32
gonna get pissed which is what Nathan

819.38 --> 830.33
often does but yeah anyone else that

828.32 --> 833.6
wants to come on you know Ruth wants to

830.33 --> 836.69
give another go sometime and then he's

833.6 --> 839.33
welcome to try it do the same thing I

836.69 --> 841.49
said last time tried to be a little bit

839.33 --> 845.87
more polite unless he gets again really

841.49 --> 848.86
devious which he also does comes a real

845.87 --> 848.86
sneaky bastard

854.31 --> 862.03
so yeah there's no there's not a lot of

857.29 --> 864.28
activity on skype so I don't know if I'm

862.03 --> 869.68
gonna have any panel members today I'm

864.28 --> 874.11
open for it though so we'll just figure

869.68 --> 874.1099999999999
out as time passes

889.6 --> 891.6
ah

892.82 --> 899.69
fast furious ok if you want to be like

896.339 --> 905.73
that then just got a discard because

899.69 --> 908.9100000000001
this is might be slightly obvious here

905.73 --> 911.85
due to the title of the show and my past

908.91 --> 915.5699999999999
activities but this is on the flatter

911.85 --> 919.41
side so this is not a Kaos open debate

915.57 --> 923.1
situation here as with Nathan who

919.41 --> 924.779
literally lets anything in or while

923.1 --> 927.14
depending on his mood but he usually

924.779 --> 930.899
lets everything in in the chat at least

927.14 --> 933.48
that's not the case here so if you're a

930.899 --> 937.31
baller you're you want to defend that

933.48 --> 943.41
that's fine but there's we don't accept

937.31 --> 945.3299999999999
just trolling and mockery you know can

943.41 --> 947.31
be a little snide or anything if you

945.33 --> 949.5
like and that's no problem but if you're

947.31 --> 954.3599999999999
just gonna be like if letter earth is a

949.5 --> 958.38
retort ya know that's just a waste of

954.36 --> 961.2
space it's no need for that and to be

958.38 --> 965.48
fair I don't really like it when

961.2 --> 965.48
flat-earthers do that to ballers as well

965.6 --> 971.66
like if you're gonna criticize ballers

968.459 --> 976.41
then just turn it into a proper analysis

971.66 --> 983.52
don't simplify oversimplify it and

976.41 --> 986.1
become like like a ya don't dumb

983.52 --> 989.43
yourself down to really mock the other

986.1 --> 992.7900000000001
it's that's because yeah you can do it

989.43 --> 996.06
it's very easy but it kind of degrades

992.79 --> 999.779
you as well I I never do that unless

996.06 --> 1002.06
somebody unless it's like unless I'm

999.779 --> 1003.98
trolling it's like some comment I I

1002.06 --> 1007.1899999999999
might make like a single comment like

1003.98 --> 1009.11
that somewhere where everybody's baller

1007.19 --> 1011.75
and thinks it's a safe space just

1009.11 --> 1013.88
because it's poking really hard but

1011.75 --> 1015.8
normally if I'm really ready to engage

1013.88 --> 1018.5
in conversation with people I'm never

1015.8 --> 1020.89
gonna do that I don't like it when

1018.5 --> 1026.41
others do it and I don't do it

1020.89 --> 1031.81
so I prefer if flat earthers in here

1026.41 --> 1034.3290000000002
don't ya

1031.81 --> 1042.04
don't go Oh ball toward ball toward you

1034.329 --> 1044.5
know not too much at least just and I've

1042.04 --> 1052.0
got a venue or time you out for it but

1044.5 --> 1055.12
it's just I'm still trying to have

1052.0 --> 1059.19
somewhat an open chat where ballers and

1055.12 --> 1062.1399999999999
flat-earthers can still hang around and

1059.19 --> 1065.98
try to get into discussion debates and

1062.14 --> 1071.23
it does happen I like that but just try

1065.98 --> 1073.8600000000001
to tone it down on average don't get all

1071.23 --> 1073.8600000000001
trolley

1083.71 --> 1086.92
[Music]

1088.05 --> 1098.3899999999999
right and the baller is not an insult

1095.48 --> 1101.39
although it does sound a little

1098.39 --> 1105.63
derogative but the same goes for when

1101.39 --> 1108.51
ballers talk about flat earthers just

1105.63 --> 1112.14
the energy they give to it when they say

1108.51 --> 1114.36
it so it's all a matter of perspective

1112.14 --> 1116.5800000000002
at that but baller is simply a

1114.36 --> 1119.04
designation it is a way to differentiate

1116.58 --> 1121.74
between it's flat earthers and ballers

1119.04 --> 1123.86
there's no real insult it's just a

1121.74 --> 1128.49
technical thing it's all about how you

1123.86 --> 1132.03
use the word with what energy that makes

1128.49 --> 1134.45
it a common thing or into an insult so

1132.03 --> 1140.66
it's all about the intention behind

1134.45 --> 1143.88
behind it of the one that's using it and

1140.66 --> 1149.91
this can sometimes be misinterpreted as

1143.88 --> 1151.5600000000002
well by opposing sides I think you're

1149.91 --> 1155.0
being insulted when it's actually not

1151.56 --> 1155.0
meant as an insult

1163.32 --> 1170.73
no Sam Bovie

1166.179 --> 1170.73
no that's not true

1172.049 --> 1180.279
Goodwin / Mukul no Sam Buffy the thing

1177.34 --> 1182.32
about that conceptualization of a

1180.279 --> 1186.22
supposed son being above a flat earth

1182.32 --> 1189.37
disc is that you already assume that it

1186.22 --> 1191.89
is a giant ball of fire that would bend

1189.37 --> 1194.52
light of the entire disk that's where

1191.89 --> 1197.3200000000002
you start the error the miss

1194.52 --> 1200.02
conceptualization of it because that is

1197.32 --> 1203.559
not what the disc flat earthers presume

1200.02 --> 1208.57
I think it's more like a local

1203.559 --> 1214.649
flashlight basically that's how that

1208.57 --> 1220.3899999999999
works out so there's a reach to it and a

1214.649 --> 1222.4599999999998
narrow focus and it still presumes that

1220.39 --> 1224.7
it's if coming from a specific place

1222.46 --> 1227.529
over the disc that's the preceptor knows

1224.7 --> 1233.919
presupposition or system of the the disc

1227.529 --> 1238.809
model that still yeah not not entirely

1233.919 --> 1241.75
correct in my opinion though because I

1238.809 --> 1249.279
don't think that the Sun is anything

1241.75 --> 1255.49
that is in a specific location I think

1249.279 --> 1261.19
it's just an apparition that all all

1255.49 --> 1263.47
sight gets to see oh yeah at the

1261.19 --> 1266.02
epicenter of where daylight comes from

1263.47 --> 1269.08
which is a in this very specific order

1266.02 --> 1273.779
in direction a relation to the position

1269.08 --> 1275.799
of the earth and that's just how it

1273.779 --> 1279.1
manifests and I don't think it's coming

1275.799 --> 1281.44
from any object at least not where we

1279.1 --> 1284.11
see the apparition of the Sun it's

1281.44 --> 1285.6100000000001
manifesting somehow and there

1284.11 --> 1287.77
theoretically it could be reflected

1285.61 --> 1292.36
somehow and then you could bring in a

1287.77 --> 1294.22
dome theory or a ceiling but I'm it

1292.36 --> 1297.03
doesn't in my opinion that doesn't even

1294.22 --> 1297.03
need to be the case

1297.39 --> 1306.72
it can simply just manifest the light

1302.74 --> 1310.56
just manifests through the potentially

1306.72 --> 1314.38
high atmospheric electrical activity

1310.56 --> 1316.27
like a side effect of all that

1314.38 --> 1319.0600000000002
electrical activity and it's just

1316.27 --> 1320.62
naturally like this for some reason of

1319.06 --> 1324.28
which the origins would have to be

1320.62 --> 1329.35
figured out of course to confirm any of

1324.28 --> 1331.87
that but that's yeah that's as far as my

1329.35 --> 1335.1699999999998
reasoning about it goes without just

1331.87 --> 1340.12
directly intertwining interdimensional

1335.17 --> 1343.24
elements which is also very weird I find

1340.12 --> 1348.1
the interdimensional relations to really

1343.24 --> 1350.35
solidify is even much weirder to me than

1348.1 --> 1353.9199999999998
for example the conceptualization of

1350.35 --> 1358.6899999999998
looping space which is not really that

1353.92 --> 1360.16
difficult to me to understand yeah but

1358.69 --> 1362.6100000000001
when you get in there dimensional then

1360.16 --> 1370.6200000000001
everything just becomes really weird and

1362.61 --> 1370.62
yeah impossible to confirm so

1372.85 --> 1386.57
hmm that was a very elaborate answer to

1376.16 --> 1390.14
that all right what are the more

1386.57 --> 1397.0
Northern Lights well from what I've

1390.14 --> 1401.7800000000002
gathered the Northern Lights are like

1397.0 --> 1405.71
it's plasma being electrified by

1401.78 --> 1408.94
atmospheric electricity so apparently

1405.71 --> 1414.43
there is at some region there is plasma

1408.94 --> 1414.43
naturally forming I think

1425.11 --> 1434.02
probably has something to do with them

1428.23 --> 1434.02
with magnetics in this case North Pole

1434.47 --> 1444.65
but I'm not sure I just figured out that

1440.81 --> 1448.28
the lights elements to it it just very

1444.65 --> 1452.6000000000001
it seems very reminiscent of yeah

1448.28 --> 1455.2
electrical electrified gases plasma that

1452.6 --> 1455.1999999999998
kind of thing

1463.81 --> 1472.58
particles from the Sun the particles

1469.96 --> 1478.75
particles from the Sun that's two

1472.58 --> 1482.27
presuppositions in one that's just great

1478.75 --> 1486.53
but hey I'm not denying the I the

1482.27 --> 1492.08
ionizing effect of sunlight on gases for

1486.53 --> 1495.17
starters so I think yeah as I said the

1492.08 --> 1498.83
Sun is very like the sunlight daylight

1495.17 --> 1503.68
is as ionizing effects it's electrical

1498.83 --> 1510.52
in nature very likely in some way yeah

1503.68 --> 1510.52
interaction with gases wasn't it

1511.95 --> 1520.13
yeah during electricity can like

1517.35 --> 1531.0
lightning storms can ionize the air

1520.13 --> 1533.75
create ozone for example and Sun did

1531.0 --> 1533.75
something else

1534.21 --> 1541.679
[Music]

1544.44 --> 1549.8200000000002
but yeah whatever causes the Northern

1547.419 --> 1552.69
Lights it's to me very obviously

1549.82 --> 1552.6899999999998
electrical in nature

1581.94 --> 1590.55
right well Sam Bovie I said this many

1585.78 --> 1595.28
times on the debates there is no

1590.55 --> 1599.99
confirmed measured distance to the Sun

1595.28 --> 1599.99
because we only see the apparent Sun

1601.67 --> 1608.88
from which the daylight comes and it's

1605.43 --> 1612.15
different depending on your location on

1608.88 --> 1616.25
the earth and your position right or has

1612.15 --> 1616.25
an influence on the apparition

1649.76 --> 1658.79
Oh hold on Ronnie Brent for it yes

1654.65 --> 1662.51
electrical nature but to say the region

1658.79 --> 1666.11
of sky isn't safe for digital aircraft

1662.51 --> 1669.2
that why would you say that who says

1666.11 --> 1670.2099999999998
that it has to be known that type of

1669.2 --> 1674.92
frequency

1670.21 --> 1679.49
okay electricity has a wide range of

1674.92 --> 1681.91
frequencies and types this is just more

1679.49 --> 1688.73
to electricity than just straightforward

1681.91 --> 1691.76
what we know and I don't know maybe

1688.73 --> 1694.48
really high up where probably this

1691.76 --> 1697.24
atmospheric electricity is coming from

1694.48 --> 1699.8600000000001
planes wouldn't even be able to go

1697.24 --> 1705.17
because the atmosphere relatively would

1699.86 --> 1707.81
be too thin for it or maybe they have

1705.17 --> 1711.8200000000002
been properly fair a Faraday cage in

1707.81 --> 1714.59
order to not be affected by it or even

1711.82 --> 1717.02
this is all fully integrated already and

1714.59 --> 1721.82
they just have receivers to actually use

1717.02 --> 1727.87
it to basically help propel them to feed

1721.82 --> 1727.87
the engines so who knows I don't know

1754.399 --> 1757.399
right

1763.09 --> 1766.48
we do now

1767.32 --> 1770.51
[Music]

1771.95 --> 1782.3400000000001
right yeah the hashtag me fat cap I met

1779.19 --> 1784.44
somebody today I was also into clothes

1782.34 --> 1787.58
making talked about it

1784.44 --> 1791.8400000000001
they say it's probably pretty easily

1787.58 --> 1794.549
ordered on the internet if I look around

1791.84 --> 1797.37
even in the Netherlands they said so I'm

1794.549 --> 1799.53
gonna check it out maybe just right now

1797.37 --> 1802.32
and see if I can get it for like 25

1799.53 --> 1807.3799999999999
euros because they said it that that's

1802.32 --> 1807.3799999999999
doable so let's see

1808.63 --> 1811.8090000000002
[Music]

1816.67 --> 1822.279
[Music]

1819.279 --> 1822.279
huh

1827.13 --> 1830.13
well

1848.57 --> 1862.1
all right well there is a lot of this

1851.48 --> 1866.33
around huh yeah I think this is very

1862.1 --> 1869.2099999999998
doable and there's some really cheap

1866.33 --> 1877.61
prices here as well as this specific

1869.21 --> 1879.32
random website that's Dutch I think so

1877.61 --> 1880.61
yeah I'm definitely yeah I'm gonna do

1879.32 --> 1882.98
this after the show otherwise I'm just

1880.61 --> 1888.25
gonna be silent and just checking all

1882.98 --> 1891.35
this out it's not really worth this show

1888.25 --> 1893.21
but yeah I could just look it I'm always

1891.35 --> 1895.1299999999999
such a guy that just think yeah you have

1893.21 --> 1898.16
to go into the city and talk to somebody

1895.13 --> 1899.96
and like figure it out how it works I

1898.16 --> 1901.43
really like that setup I like stores

1899.96 --> 1906.1100000000001
that way because you can really go to

1901.43 --> 1908.69
the the person in the store and they

1906.11 --> 1911.6899999999998
will know stuff about all the products

1908.69 --> 1913.88
sometimes they know a lot and that way

1911.69 --> 1916.04
you can really fine-tune what you're

1913.88 --> 1917.8700000000001
looking for and I like that yeah through

1916.04 --> 1920.57
the internet that's not really the case

1917.87 --> 1922.6
you you really have to get a proper

1920.57 --> 1925.49
interface and be sure that you're

1922.6 --> 1926.99
ordering the right details and that it

1925.49 --> 1928.46
and I just hope it's gonna work out

1926.99 --> 1931.61
brains base ik Aliso that's the

1928.46 --> 1933.65
disadvantage of it but you had allowed

1931.61 --> 1935.87
these prices that was just really cheap

1933.65 --> 1939.74
so I am gonna check that out and maybe I

1935.87 --> 1944.11
can even get a hashtag meifa cap really

1939.74 --> 1944.11
cheaply and that will be really cool

1949.159 --> 1959.2990000000002
right kids are back making lots of noise

1975.88 --> 1978.5100000000002
yeah

1985.2 --> 1993.43
yeah it's kind of fun to look at but

1989.55 --> 1995.74
there yeah one thing I noticed is that

1993.43 --> 1998.8300000000002
they're really easily distracted like

1995.74 --> 2000.69
every 10 seconds they would just like oh

1998.83 --> 2002.55
yeah this run towards it

2000.69 --> 2004.1100000000001
nothing like oh and then somebody else's

2002.55 --> 2006.51
although I want to do this and then

2004.11 --> 2008.4299999999998
everybody wants to do that it's like

2006.51 --> 2013.77
every 10 seconds they keep on getting

2008.43 --> 2020.3100000000002
distracted but I think they're really

2013.77 --> 2025.44
young like between four and six or eight

2020.31 --> 2027.4199999999998
something like that yeah yeah and they

2025.44 --> 2030.0900000000001
have a lot of toys all draped all over

2027.42 --> 2035.27
the place down there so yeah they're

2030.09 --> 2035.27
just having a nice fun afternoon

2045.93 --> 2051.989
yep

2048.88 --> 2051.989
[Music]

2053.22 --> 2058.9289999999996
yeah and the funny thing is also like

2055.99 --> 2061.75
there's this logos thing go and that is

2058.929 --> 2064.0
that just I really I'm learning more and

2061.75 --> 2067.48
more to appreciate the sound of children

2064.0 --> 2071.109
it's weird because when I was a teenager

2067.48 --> 2073.54
I couldn't stand it like really hated it

2071.109 --> 2078.24
yeah well yeah totally went into the

2073.54 --> 2080.98
liberal angle of that and just be

2078.24 --> 2084.7
overpopulation I totally bought into all

2080.98 --> 2090.22
that back then but now I just feel like

2084.7 --> 2093.04
damn I gotta get me some of those and I

2090.22 --> 2097.27
just like the sound of even when they're

2093.04 --> 2101.17
being a bit Yeley yeah they're of course

2097.27 --> 2103.5099999999998
also kids just go over the top and start

2101.17 --> 2106.53
screaming that some of them really loud

2103.51 --> 2112.8390000000004
that is annoying but other than that

2106.53 --> 2116.829
yeah I appreciate the enthusiastic

2112.839 --> 2120.869
squeals of children and I'm just fooling

2116.829 --> 2123.94
around with no easily I kind of like it

2120.869 --> 2125.829
unless you can't hear yourself in the

2123.94 --> 2129.2400000000002
process so when Paul does it on the

2125.829 --> 2138.76
debates and like you visually hear a

2129.24 --> 2140.91
pile of children crawling by children

2138.76 --> 2149.76
avalanche

2140.91 --> 2149.7599999999998
yep that can be a bit annoying

2160.66 --> 2163.8599999999997
[Music]

2165.89 --> 2182.49
hey Noel Oh cheeky cheeky magpie Simon

2182.01 --> 2185.03
Dan

2182.49 --> 2185.0299999999997
where is he

2188.5 --> 2197.609
all right you just wanted to do a shout

2191.77 --> 2197.609
out right that makes him exist

2198.18 --> 2206.49
somebody says his name so he's not dead

2201.22 --> 2206.49
yet even though he's already a ghost

2223.28 --> 2231.9700000000003
of course Renny Branford you know I

2226.57 --> 2231.9700000000003
answer questions ask away

2239.09 --> 2245.7400000000002
Oh Agron wells ultra-hd music

2254.58 --> 2257.58
okay

2277.73 --> 2290.76
where is Effy heading well it's going

2284.82 --> 2299.34
all over the world it's just gonna be a

2290.76 --> 2302.46
new grassroots thing it's that's just

2299.34 --> 2306.75
what it is it's happened before it's

2302.46 --> 2310.11
almost like a in a way you could

2306.75 --> 2313.71
consider it like a pagan grassroots

2310.11 --> 2321.81
rebound like how that could be

2313.71 --> 2325.86
considered versus the old theocracy of

2321.81 --> 2330.9
the Catholic Church and everything this

2325.86 --> 2335.34
Flat Earth is just a grassroots like

2330.9 --> 2337.55
counter movement like no no we know this

2335.34 --> 2341.88
is [ __ ] so we're gonna do our thing

2337.55 --> 2346.65
it's almost like a Protestantism but

2341.88 --> 2350.4900000000002
it's much more opposing when with

2346.65 --> 2352.2000000000003
Protestantism it's just a minor or minor

2350.49 --> 2353.8799999999997
it's just a few philosophical

2352.2 --> 2355.71
differences and detailed differences

2353.88 --> 2358.4100000000003
that make a huge difference in the

2355.71 --> 2362.79
overall culture but with us it's just

2358.41 --> 2369.3599999999997
totally true opposing it's just

2362.79 --> 2371.82
completely in the opposite but it's

2369.36 --> 2376.1400000000003
gonna be there and this whole it's gonna

2371.82 --> 2378.4500000000003
stay like it's something that the that

2376.14 --> 2381.75
the flat earthers the ones that do do

2378.45 --> 2383.6099999999997
grasp it even if they do it

2381.75 --> 2386.31
superficially at the start eventually

2383.61 --> 2387.8700000000003
they figure it out just from all the

2386.31 --> 2391.02
pressure that comes with it they just

2387.87 --> 2395.96
harden up and they sharpen and they know

2391.02 --> 2398.85
like this is really really important and

2395.96 --> 2403.23
Devils are going to be chasing you over

2398.85 --> 2407.19
it probably for a very long time it

2403.23 --> 2408.71
makes everything different but it's not

2407.19 --> 2411.29
gonna go away

2408.71 --> 2412.9700000000003
it might just stay in the under layer

2411.29 --> 2414.829
it's gonna be like okay this is the

2412.97 --> 2417.2
mainstream it mainstream pretends it's

2414.829 --> 2420.71
the only thing there is then there is

2417.2 --> 2423.68
the sub mainstream the alternative media

2420.71 --> 2426.8
which the mainstream still approaches

2423.68 --> 2428.7799999999997
talks about as in it exists but then

2426.8 --> 2430.9700000000003
discourage it and people will definitely

2428.78 --> 2434.9300000000003
latch on to it and then there is Flat

2430.97 --> 2441.02
Earth beyond it and nobody basically

2434.93 --> 2443.45
addresses it or maybe jokingly and it's

2441.02 --> 2445.97
gonna stay like that probably for a long

2443.45 --> 2448.04
time but it is yeah while it's gonna

2445.97 --> 2450.8799999999997
stay under the scope in the meantime it

2448.04 --> 2453.92
is gonna be spreading basically like

2450.88 --> 2456.02
pamphlet pamphlets of resistance would

2453.92 --> 2458.03
be spread in secret among the people

2456.02 --> 2460.7599999999998
even though official evening almost

2458.03 --> 2463.6400000000003
nobody knew about it everybody would

2460.76 --> 2465.98
know about it and that's what is gonna

2463.64 --> 2469.8489999999997
happen it is happening whether it is in

2465.98 --> 2473.27
open view for everyone or not and it

2469.849 --> 2478.4900000000002
will stay because it is just routed in

2473.27 --> 2481.42
awareness of the mind control of of the

2478.49 --> 2484.7299999999996
government system and all its tentacles

2481.42 --> 2486.7400000000002
it's a very direct awareness with very

2484.73 --> 2493.46
direct in your face proof of it and not

2486.74 --> 2497.2
just fake suggestions that's what also

2493.46 --> 2500.089
makes it so hard to let it sink in

2497.2 --> 2504.23
because it changes everything it just

2500.089 --> 2508.569
turns everything around what was once

2504.23 --> 2508.569
trusted can no longer be trusted

2510.67 --> 2520.89
[Music]

2511.89 --> 2527.0989999999997
I can barely hear myself over his jounin

2520.89 --> 2533.3689999999997
here right now X 320 if you want snacks

2527.099 --> 2537.3900000000003
then you can donate to my paypal and if

2533.369 --> 2542.13
you do that and I see it's you then I

2537.39 --> 2544.2
will definitely get a castle or a

2542.13 --> 2550.23
loominatee croissant from it the next

2544.2 --> 2553.109
day so as that I'm open for the food

2550.23 --> 2555.619
entertainment business because that is

2553.109 --> 2555.619
what you like

2558.89 --> 2562.0499999999997
[Music]

2562.53 --> 2568.42
and it'll be guaranteed to be enjoyed

2566.02 --> 2573.22
so I take it that's part of the the

2568.42 --> 2580.03
enjoyment of it so anyway just justice

2573.22 --> 2583.12
just a suggestion all right wait

2580.03 --> 2585.1600000000003
there was somebody asking or gonna ask

2583.12 --> 2591.94
me a question before I answered that

2585.16 --> 2598.99
other question said Ronny Brett for it

2591.94 --> 2607.9900000000002
right where's your question Ronny uh you

2598.99 --> 2617.41
haven't asked it all right okay x3 20

2607.99 --> 2620.4599999999996
that's fine so am i don't tell me what

2617.41 --> 2620.46
to do mark doxy

2627.93 --> 2630.93
where

2641.31 --> 2644.45
oh wait

2650.77 --> 2655.96
all right Ronny Brad yeah indeed you did

2654.04 --> 2658.93
ask the question it's a good question

2655.96 --> 2661.0
Ronny Bradford asked every flat earther

2658.93 --> 2663.58
has an event a turning point that made

2661.0 --> 2669.73
them turn on globe earth what was your

2663.58 --> 2672.369
moment well my moment was 2015 thanks to

2669.73 --> 2675.43
mark Sargent and the YouTube the just

2672.369 --> 2678.04
arriving Flat Earth YouTube community

2675.43 --> 2680.14
there was like springing up people were

2678.04 --> 2684.67
suddenly it was suddenly growing quickly

2680.14 --> 2688.24
and that made me realize yeah there is

2684.67 --> 2693.16
gonna be a permanent group of people

2688.24 --> 2696.1
with which I can go and talk about this

2693.16 --> 2698.41
for real and really get to the more

2696.1 --> 2701.29
intricate details of it without just

2698.41 --> 2703.33
bashing into the first obstructions and

2701.29 --> 2705.4
fights and all that [ __ ] happening which

2703.33 --> 2711.7599999999998
I did experience every time before that

2705.4 --> 2716.859
when I tried that so 2015 I just knew

2711.76 --> 2720.76
okay I can do it now and not basically

2716.859 --> 2723.85
choke myself into a permanent isolation

2720.76 --> 2729.0400000000004
and that's why I decided to do that

2723.85 --> 2732.0099999999998
because there was a group that would be

2729.04 --> 2733.84
mine that I would be a part of without

2732.01 --> 2738.19
that group I probably would have never

2733.84 --> 2742.71
done it and like many others this was

2738.19 --> 2745.96
even talked about like even back then in

2742.71 --> 2747.84
2015 like Mark Sargeant knew a lot of

2745.96 --> 2751.75
people that did know about it

2747.84 --> 2755.369
but that were just admittedly in secret

2751.75 --> 2758.02
not not with their names but immediately

2755.369 --> 2760.06
didn't want to show their faces they

2758.02 --> 2762.19
were very interested they kind of did

2760.06 --> 2766.99
believe it but they were afraid to come

2762.19 --> 2770.32
out with it now now it's different now

2766.99 --> 2771.85
all these people really do want to come

2770.32 --> 2773.7400000000002
out with it because they know there are

2771.85 --> 2775.75
so many more there's all these people I

2773.74 --> 2777.9399999999996
cannot talk with it and it's gonna stay

2775.75 --> 2781.9
it is has been there for a long time

2777.94 --> 2784.16
we've all seen how everybody's develop

2781.9 --> 2790.4990000000003
and that it's real it's now

2784.16 --> 2792.359
it's not some stupid stage act so that's

2790.499 --> 2797.16
very encouraging to those that were

2792.359 --> 2799.68
before too shy to do it or uncertain and

2797.16 --> 2802.0789999999997
now there's still just a lot of people

2799.68 --> 2804.18
out there that might believe it but are

2802.079 --> 2807.6600000000003
just not outspoken about it and that's

2804.18 --> 2809.729
like the the new layer it's a very wide

2807.66 --> 2812.519
layer just like a lot of it pretty

2809.729 --> 2815.9399999999996
indifferent neutral people out there in

2812.519 --> 2818.9689999999996
the Western world not everybody is

2815.94 --> 2822.029
really on one side a lot of people can

2818.969 --> 2825.299
entertain a lot of ideas very flexible

2822.029 --> 2828.509
and they won't be picky about it they

2825.299 --> 2830.369
usually are more happy to just have an

2828.509 --> 2832.7690000000002
interesting conversation about whatever

2830.369 --> 2835.92
there's a lot of people like that in the

2832.769 --> 2837.2389999999996
Netherlands at least I don't know how

2835.92 --> 2839.4300000000003
that is in America maybe is like

2837.239 --> 2841.0190000000002
everybody's totally politically

2839.43 --> 2842.7
polarized there and all that kind of

2841.019 --> 2845.3089999999997
[ __ ] I don't know but in the Netherlands

2842.7 --> 2847.019
I've met a lot of people that don't

2845.309 --> 2850.619
really mind one way or the other they're

2847.019 --> 2856.2889999999998
just very flexible almost a little bit

2850.619 --> 2858.869
too flexible you'd say and you can talk

2856.289 --> 2863.489
to them about Flat Earth and they won't

2858.869 --> 2865.6800000000003
be pissed off or anything they won't

2863.489 --> 2867.39
have a response to them that usually

2865.68 --> 2870.9489999999996
they've many people already heard about

2867.39 --> 2874.999
it like almost every time it comes up

2870.949 --> 2877.7090000000003
the person that I'm bringing it up with

2874.999 --> 2881.339
definitely has heard of it before I've

2877.709 --> 2884.3689999999997
never met anyone for a long time that I

2881.339 --> 2887.029
started introducing it that has no that

2884.369 --> 2891.569
had never heard of it before it nobody

2887.029 --> 2892.17
it hasn't happened in years so yeah it's

2891.569 --> 2895.64
spread

2892.17 --> 2895.64
it absolutely spread

2901.37 --> 2904.44
[Music]

2916.28 --> 2918.9100000000003
yeah

2919.46 --> 2925.349
that's interesting isn't it Sam Bovie

2922.549 --> 2928.619
why does how does the share the Sun

2925.349 --> 2930.869
shadow works work that's the weird thing

2928.619 --> 2934.0190000000002
about it usually when you when the Sun

2930.869 --> 2936.2400000000002
is at the horizon that horizon lights up

2934.019 --> 2938.609
and then you get to see extremely far

2936.24 --> 2940.3489999999997
thanks to the holographic phenomena of

2938.609 --> 2943.819
the Sun because a certain day light is

2940.349 --> 2948.9900000000002
coming from that direction and certainly

2943.819 --> 2950.16
makes it better visible because of

2948.99 --> 2952.7099999999996
shadow works and all that it's

2950.16 --> 2957.019
interesting but you have to realize that

2952.71 --> 2961.65
these things are so far away so far away

2957.019 --> 2963.5989999999997
right that if you'd be in that location

2961.65 --> 2966.539
that you actually see there on the

2963.599 --> 2968.25
horizon you would if you would be there

2966.539 --> 2971.7000000000003
anymore if you would have somebody that

2968.25 --> 2973.74
would be literally there where they

2971.7 --> 2978.2
would be the Sun would be in a different

2973.74 --> 2983.0
position it would not be at Horizon and

2978.2 --> 2986.64
thus from their angle the sunlight is

2983.0 --> 2989.22
coming from a different location costing

2986.64 --> 2994.97
different types of shadows and that's

2989.22 --> 2998.549
how things are really surreal that's

2994.97 --> 3002.1499999999996
again more mystery and more indication

2998.549 --> 3004.13
to me that some like daylight and the

3002.15 --> 3008.349
sudden apparent Sun position is a

3004.13 --> 3012.4700000000003
holographic phenomena and not a literal

3008.349 --> 3014.119
position not an object because of all

3012.47 --> 3019.7
these weird light and shadow workings

3014.119 --> 3022.099
and I think that it's just one person in

3019.7 --> 3024.95
one location may experience the daylight

3022.099 --> 3028.789
coming from one direction specifically

3024.95 --> 3030.89
and in another location even though they

3028.789 --> 3034.2200000000003
could technically potentially see each

3030.89 --> 3035.96
other that other person will have the

3034.22 --> 3041.6899999999996
daylight come from a different direction

3035.96 --> 3044.289
and thus witness different shadow

3041.69 --> 3044.289
workings

3046.509 --> 3057.949
yeah think about that yeah anyway it's

3055.009 --> 3061.089
it's interesting to try it out sometime

3057.949 --> 3061.089
and we could do it

3061.269 --> 3066.979
be sure to have like really good zooming

3064.489 --> 3069.079
cameras and then just get these fast

3066.979 --> 3072.049
distances away from each other

3069.079 --> 3074.239
potentially with mountainous areas to

3072.049 --> 3077.18
get a more direct line of sight with

3074.239 --> 3080.449
each other from a mountaintop to

3077.18 --> 3086.4489999999996
somewhere in a valley very far away if

3080.449 --> 3088.67
but if possible and then see what it

3086.449 --> 3091.549
looks like over at each other and then

3088.67 --> 3094.449
compare footages let's see what how the

3091.549 --> 3097.339
shadows really are are those shadows

3094.449 --> 3101.509
that are seen by the other party really

3097.339 --> 3104.119
in the same location as the party being

3101.509 --> 3106.13
filmed or when they look around them are

3104.119 --> 3108.699
the shadows in different places what's

3106.13 --> 3108.699
going on

3115.66 --> 3121.1499999999996
anyway I got stuck in chat

3130.45 --> 3137.799
right Major Tom we've answered that

3132.97 --> 3140.74
question many times before technically

3137.799 --> 3143.5
yes but I wouldn't just go with some

3140.74 --> 3146.95
right I would have demands and those

3143.5 --> 3149.95
demands would never be fulfilled so it's

3146.95 --> 3153.79
probably never gonna happen because I'm

3149.95 --> 3158.319
not just gonna surrender to some group

3153.79 --> 3161.41
like yeah especially let's say it's

3158.319 --> 3163.99
gonna be the ultimate rocket launch to

3161.41 --> 3166.72
convince some certain flat-earthers

3163.99 --> 3170.14
the earth is not flat yeah and then the

3166.72 --> 3178.6299999999997
freaking rocket explodes you know oh it

3170.14 --> 3180.3689999999997
was an accident no thanks I wouldn't be

3178.63 --> 3184.0
surprised if at some point something

3180.369 --> 3186.25
like that would actually happened and I

3184.0 --> 3188.53
don't want to be part of that I don't

3186.25 --> 3192.4
have a longing to find some kind of

3188.53 --> 3194.77
mysterious proof of space you know I'd

3192.4 --> 3198.1600000000003
love to go into the vomit comet some

3194.77 --> 3203.14
time and actually fool around with what

3198.16 --> 3205.5099999999998
they call zero-g or perfect neutral

3203.14 --> 3209.8799999999997
disequilibrium with the relative

3205.51 --> 3209.88
densities and by the falling motions

3210.39 --> 3216.43
whatever you want to call it I would

3214.9 --> 3221.589
definitely like to experience that

3216.43 --> 3225.5789999999997
because I know exactly what that is it's

3221.589 --> 3227.5589999999997
not that dangerous so yeah there's

3225.579 --> 3229.6600000000003
things I want to experiment with and

3227.559 --> 3233.4700000000003
fool around with and just do tests of

3229.66 --> 3236.41
absolutely but I don't want to go on

3233.47 --> 3243.1299999999997
some freaking rocket or whatever -

3236.41 --> 3248.74
supposedly go to space no thanks I'd I'd

3243.13 --> 3252.309
rather risk doing some project like that

3248.74 --> 3255.25
completely on my own with just a team of

3252.309 --> 3258.6400000000003
why yeah really good engineers and

3255.25 --> 3260.14
flat-earthers and really a good budget

3258.64 --> 3262.089
you do require a good budget and

3260.14 --> 3263.56
actually get like okay we're gonna do

3262.089 --> 3266.25
something like

3263.56 --> 3270.85
what's his name again professor Picard

3266.25 --> 3273.91
and do some really heavy balloon stuff

3270.85 --> 3277.93
to see just how high you can go maybe

3273.91 --> 3280.5099999999998
other stuff added on top of that I don't

3277.93 --> 3282.58
know that deck would be awesome but I'm

3280.51 --> 3287.67
not gonna just go along with some

3282.58 --> 3291.21
weirdness outright absolutely not

3287.67 --> 3291.21
don't trust these people

3309.79 --> 3317.05
right density column test exactly it is

3313.86 --> 3320.05
another weird aberration that really

3317.05 --> 3322.8300000000004
supports the conceptualization of force

3320.05 --> 3325.8100000000004
this equilibrium being present and by

3322.83 --> 3329.38
basically creating a standard velocity

3325.81 --> 3333.0099999999998
in a certain way you counterman that

3329.38 --> 3337.8900000000003
apparent force and thus relative density

3333.01 --> 3341.2900000000004
laws within the materials in a relative

3337.89 --> 3344.74
moving state set becomes very weird at

3341.29 --> 3346.84
that yeah it's funny how then certainly

3344.74 --> 3348.66
the materials don't divide us they do

3346.84 --> 3350.71
and is just surface tension mostly

3348.66 --> 3352.54
things that you mix up that have

3350.71 --> 3355.12
different relative densities will just

3352.54 --> 3357.79
stay mixed up and only the surface

3355.12 --> 3360.64
tension will make the material be drawn

3357.79 --> 3362.56
to one another naturally that's very

3360.64 --> 3368.0499999999997
fascinating but it falls under the

3362.56 --> 3372.82
aberrations of gravity again so quiet

3368.05 --> 3375.78
I'm not quiet no way my volume is still

3372.82 --> 3375.78
at a hundred and eighty

3387.69 --> 3396.1
all right well Berta Charlie it's that

3393.52 --> 3402.46
direction the then that's just how the

3396.1 --> 3404.62
relative density spectrum is divided the

3402.46 --> 3408.01
heavier density seems to be going that

3404.62 --> 3410.56
way in relation to the lighter density

3408.01 --> 3413.11
with tends to go that way well however

3410.56 --> 3414.52
it is relative towards its an

3413.11 --> 3419.77
environment that seems to be the

3414.52 --> 3423.19
division it's just a side note though in

3419.77 --> 3426.78
the relative density theory the

3423.19 --> 3426.78
scientific proven theory

3435.57 --> 3439.179
[Music]

3445.98 --> 3450.05
[Music]

3451.479 --> 3458.68
yeah that's right I said scientifically

3455.18 --> 3462.14
proven relative density that's right

3458.68 --> 3464.39
independent variable the density in

3462.14 --> 3468.2889999999998
relation to its surrounding it works

3464.39 --> 3470.449
it's doable it can vary the independent

3468.289 --> 3472.69
variable and it is the cause and it

3470.449 --> 3472.69
works

3479.599 --> 3484.369
right yeah peanuts Clark I no longer

3482.119 --> 3487.009
really post the link in Skype I don't

3484.369 --> 3487.609
have a back panel I don't use Google for

3487.009 --> 3492.7690000000002
that anymore

3487.609 --> 3495.619
it's been mess functioning as in that

3492.769 --> 3499.3089999999997
sometimes in panels people can just not

3495.619 --> 3500.839
hear other panelists even though those

3499.309 --> 3503.8390000000004
panelists could hear them it's very

3500.839 --> 3507.019
weird this error happens and I've been

3503.839 --> 3508.94
porn bombed a while ago and a dot just I

3507.019 --> 3512.6299999999997
don't want to use that anymore so I just

3508.94 --> 3515.44
do Skype calls so if you want to be part

3512.63 --> 3517.789
of the panel you can Skype call me

3515.44 --> 3522.859
that's how it's going to be working from

3517.789 --> 3527.059
now on and has worked great so far

3522.859 --> 3529.489
skypes very reliable connection did have

3527.059 --> 3532.779
a little a few presentation problems

3529.489 --> 3537.349
though I was kind of sad to see with the

3532.779 --> 3540.529
last part with Randa I thought I was

3537.349 --> 3544.099
presenting stuff and I turned out not to

3540.529 --> 3546.019
be it had the wrong it had Brenda's icon

3544.099 --> 3548.69
basically presented and not my screen

3546.019 --> 3551.2389999999996
that was too bad but I did put out the

3548.69 --> 3552.9790000000003
link in chat so people could actually

3551.239 --> 3554.39
confirm what I was saying I was

3552.979 --> 3557.479
literally reading it out

3554.39 --> 3561.41
unfortunately the paper itself the text

3557.479 --> 3563.269
was not on screen oh well that's

3561.41 --> 3565.1299999999997
something I have to work out figure out

3563.269 --> 3567.9489999999996
how to do that maybe I can do it in

3565.13 --> 3573.44
another way new presentation through

3567.949 --> 3578.15
another screen I'm just working on it so

3573.44 --> 3580.099
I'm gonna round out the show I've been

3578.15 --> 3584.2690000000002
gone for an hour and nathan is going

3580.099 --> 3586.5190000000002
live so thanks everyone for coming I

3584.269 --> 3590.66
hope you enjoyed the show if you have

3586.519 --> 3592.0989999999997
please up fold it and forget that and if

3590.66 --> 3595.3089999999997
you haven't already subscribed to my

3592.099 --> 3596.869
channel and hit the bell notifications

3595.309 --> 3597.799
so you know when I'm going live which is

3596.869 --> 3601.2490000000003
normally 2:00 p.m.

3597.799 --> 3604.509
Amsterdam time also please support this

3601.249 --> 3610.8999999999996
show through the Super chats paypal

3604.509 --> 3613.31
patreon and also I have a GoFundMe for

3610.9 --> 3614.96
ap1000 all of it is in the

3613.31 --> 3619.04
description box below any support will

3614.96 --> 3621.86
be much appreciated also hashtag me if I

3619.04 --> 3625.9
indeed and I'm gonna check out if I can

3621.86 --> 3630.5
get a really unexpectedly cheap bright

3625.9 --> 3633.26
neon yellow hashtag me for hack through

3630.5 --> 3634.7
the internet I don't know how long

3633.26 --> 3636.8900000000003
that's gonna take out but it's gonna be

3634.7 --> 3638.0
I might be able to arrange it within a

3636.89 --> 3640.64
week that will be cool

3638.0 --> 3643.55
we'll see I'll keep you updated about it

3640.64 --> 3643.73
and I'll be back tomorrow with Flat

3643.55 --> 3648.6200000000003
Earth

3643.73 --> 3656.07
early-bird number 188 and until the next

3648.62 --> 3687.3689999999997
time keep it flat and have a nice day

3656.07 --> 3687.369
