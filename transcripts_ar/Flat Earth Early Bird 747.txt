157.12 --> 164.0
it was pretty active and

161.599 --> 165.28
yeah we had like this very long after

164.0 --> 168.879
conversation

165.28 --> 171.92
last day like really long switch to

168.879 --> 174.79999999999998
skype eventually like we

171.92 --> 177.04
we kept on chatting like until six

174.8 --> 181.04000000000002
o'clock or even past that

177.04 --> 184.4
seven o'clock i don't know what the guys

181.04 --> 184.4
my wizards council

186.959 --> 192.8
and yeah um benjamin's also live and it

189.76 --> 192.79999999999998
was just a lot of fun

196.84 --> 200.8
yeah a little sporadic

203.04 --> 208.72
uh right so that's it

206.239 --> 210.959
as far as my notes go i watched a lot of

208.72 --> 213.92
south park yesterday

210.959 --> 214.72
just had fun with that watch through the

213.92 --> 217.51899999999998
third season

214.72 --> 217.519
into the fourth

218.799 --> 222.239
i spent a lot of time that way didn't

221.68 --> 227.84
really

222.239 --> 227.84
watch any other videos

232.4 --> 237.36
right did i watch my own show back i

234.08 --> 242.64000000000001
don't think so i think i forgot

237.36 --> 242.64000000000001
yeah anyway i'm here now

243.84 --> 252.0
and i'm open for questions

247.76 --> 255.599
hey dark steve84 brand m

252.0 --> 257.84
in the shower okay and be careful with

255.599 --> 257.84
that

264.72 --> 269.84000000000003
so got some green tea with me

272.43 --> 276.6
[Music]

283.12 --> 285.44
right

288.4 --> 292.63899999999995
so how you guys and gals all doing

294.479 --> 298.08
snow halfway the month

299.28 --> 302.79999999999995
so i think it should be like one more

301.039 --> 303.759
week and then a lot of people will get

302.8 --> 306.88
their

303.759 --> 309.199
vacation times

306.88 --> 311.84
like the christmas holidays will start i

309.199 --> 311.84000000000003
think

313.6 --> 317.12
so maybe i'm catching that feeling it's

316.479 --> 319.28
weird like

317.12 --> 321.12
since a couple of days it's like grown

319.28 --> 324.4
like

321.12 --> 326.32
get a little tired

324.4 --> 330.32
even though like i'm pretty much doing

326.32 --> 330.32
exactly the same as three weeks ago

331.28 --> 335.919
i'm like almost like waiting in

333.6 --> 340.96000000000004
anticipation for something that

335.919 --> 340.96
in a feeling it's not really

341.68 --> 344.8
has had nothing really to do with

343.759 --> 353.84000000000003
anything that

344.8 --> 353.84000000000003
my life is like

355.6 --> 359.03900000000004
so i think i'm picking up on that

364.84 --> 367.84
right

370.479 --> 374.24
yeah this is by the way the first time

372.319 --> 376.72
since a whole row of

374.24 --> 380.0
early birds where i just could not think

376.72 --> 395.84000000000003
of a title

380.0 --> 395.84
it's weird

397.68 --> 403.6
anyway i'm up for

401.44 --> 406.0
talking about flat earth i'm up for

403.6 --> 409.03900000000004
talking about a lot of things

406.0 --> 411.68
don't you usually start yes yes i do

409.039 --> 411.68
that's right

415.44 --> 420.84
i used to start at 2 pm amsterdam time

417.84 --> 422.0
but now i've set it to 1 pm amsterdam

420.84 --> 424.63899999999995
time

422.0 --> 425.599
i don't know i'm it's a bit troublesome

424.639 --> 428.8
because

425.599 --> 431.44
more recently i've just grown to stay up

428.8 --> 434.08
late and then it it's a little difficult

431.44 --> 434.08
to start up

434.16 --> 438.24
because i usually get up around 12.

445.599 --> 449.919
and then sometimes it takes a little

447.68 --> 453.12
longer for me to just properly wake up

449.919 --> 454.79999999999995
even though i get coffee and everything

453.12 --> 456.479
and i don't know maybe it's also because

454.8 --> 457.44
of the weather it just makes me a little

456.479 --> 461.44
like

457.44 --> 461.44
i don't really want to hurry up

462.0 --> 468.479
it's all gray out there

465.44 --> 472.4
right anyway i would really appreciate

468.479 --> 473.919
some interaction with my chat today

472.4 --> 476.79999999999995
because i don't really have anything

473.919 --> 493.84
specific i want to talk about

476.8 --> 493.84000000000003
at the at the time being

513.839 --> 519.12
right or not just keep staring at the

517.599 --> 522.399
screen silently

519.12 --> 525.6
waiting for something to happen

522.399 --> 526.959
i hope that viewers aren't exactly doing

525.6 --> 530.0
the same because that's

526.959 --> 534.56
a bit of a waste of time

530.0 --> 537.76
but yeah i am open i'm like a can

534.56 --> 539.3599999999999
pressurized can ready to be open it's up

537.76 --> 543.04
to the viewers

539.36 --> 548.98
people in chat because i really don't

543.04 --> 552.1089999999999
have anything specific to talk about

548.98 --> 552.109
[Music]

555.36 --> 561.36
also thinking about like wait

558.959 --> 562.8
yeah maybe i do have a little bit

561.36 --> 564.9590000000001
something to talk about but it's going

562.8 --> 567.1999999999999
to be about me again surprise surprise

564.959 --> 567.1999999999999
so

567.279 --> 572.88
it's just that this two hours a day

570.8 --> 574.8389999999999
and with the ups and downs that

572.88 --> 578.959
typically accompany with

574.839 --> 582.399
me wondering if

578.959 --> 585.04
like maybe i should not do

582.399 --> 586.48
everyday show maybe i should like skip a

585.04 --> 590.16
day somewhere

586.48 --> 592.5600000000001
to kind of get me extra charged again

590.16 --> 594.56
because this was also a problem before

592.56 --> 595.3599999999999
with only the one hour show now of

594.56 --> 598.56
course it was

595.36 --> 603.12
a different type of

598.56 --> 603.1199999999999
way of being still drinking and all that

603.68 --> 611.12
well yeah if i ever like skip the show

607.76 --> 612.8
or or yeah whatever to go somewhere

611.12 --> 616.079
didn't do a show like the next day i

612.8 --> 618.079
usually be more energized

616.079 --> 619.279
and now that i'm doing two shows maybe

618.079 --> 621.4399999999999
that problem

619.279 --> 622.48
is gonna is coming back and it's gonna

621.44 --> 625.12
be worse

622.48 --> 627.6
and that's not nice i don't wanna be

625.12 --> 627.6
like half

627.68 --> 630.88
every few shows basically me not being

630.16 --> 632.8
able to

630.88 --> 635.519
figure out what to talk about that's

632.8 --> 635.519
kind of annoying

639.68 --> 647.8389999999999
219 what

643.519 --> 647.839
common cold right sure

648.079 --> 653.12
do you really think treated fairly on

650.88 --> 655.6
the flat of debates

653.12 --> 657.12
yeah well they do give me a hard time

655.6 --> 657.76
and they don't let me speak yeah but

657.12 --> 660.88
it's

657.76 --> 663.36
yeah that happens

660.88 --> 664.079
it's it's really on the mood sometimes i

663.36 --> 666.399
think that

664.079 --> 669.1999999999999
the guys don't really are they're not in

666.399 --> 669.2
the mood for me

672.0 --> 675.839
i don't know why

676.32 --> 681.6800000000001
but yes but these days if something like

679.44 --> 689.839
that happens i do absolutely speak out

681.68 --> 689.8389999999999
about it usually

693.76 --> 700.56
but i don't mind you know because

697.04 --> 704.24
everybody has urges to basically

700.56 --> 704.2399999999999
say things they've learned and

704.32 --> 710.72
like even though i have interesting

706.24 --> 710.72
ideas it's not always that relevant

711.2 --> 714.639
you know and i do have like when i

713.04 --> 716.8
typically break in often

714.639 --> 720.32
i have the tendency to either just

716.8 --> 721.8389999999999
explain the obvious very concisely

720.32 --> 723.6800000000001
to clarify the point that's being

721.839 --> 726.0790000000001
addressed or i

723.68 --> 728.2399999999999
bring in something completely new kind

726.079 --> 728.2399999999999
of

728.32 --> 733.0400000000001
sidetracking the conversation sometimes

731.44 --> 734.0790000000001
that's good and sometimes that's

733.04 --> 736.88
annoying

734.079 --> 738.0
so i'm just a different type of guy in a

736.88 --> 740.72
group

738.0 --> 744.24
than most and i guess that sometimes

740.72 --> 747.6
they just don't want me to break in

744.24 --> 750.8
and it's more intuitively so

747.6 --> 752.48
but it's just the way it is

750.8 --> 754.24
that's just the group dynamic there's

752.48 --> 756.399
nothing really i can do about it but

754.24 --> 756.399
just

757.76 --> 761.04
i don't know elbow my way through a

759.68 --> 762.88
little sometimes

761.04 --> 764.3199999999999
everybody constantly over over talks

762.88 --> 767.519
everywhere i'm just like no

764.32 --> 770.0
now i'm gonna talk no i'm gonna talk no

767.519 --> 771.519
don't overtalk me let me finish my point

770.0 --> 773.279
shut up

771.519 --> 774.88
because people get really rumpussy

773.279 --> 778.16
sometimes when i'm just

774.88 --> 778.16
trying to put something down

782.079 --> 790.399
but yeah what are you gonna do

786.959 --> 790.399
it's not always like that you know

792.94 --> 796.0790000000001
[Music]

797.44 --> 804.1600000000001
right yes michael jones i know

801.279 --> 805.279
it's just that kiwi should just never

804.16 --> 808.48
join

805.279 --> 811.6
the group on a call if he hasn't have

808.48 --> 813.44
is if he hasn't had breakfast because

811.6 --> 814.0
it's really annoying and for some reason

813.44 --> 817.12
he gets

814.0 --> 819.6
pissed off at my voice because he always

817.12 --> 823.12
starts yelling at me is it

819.6 --> 825.44
like yesterday i think

823.12 --> 827.279
after the show ended that happened too

825.44 --> 830.399
and i just

827.279 --> 832.399
just told him like dude like

830.399 --> 834.0
we've been having a conversation here

832.399 --> 836.959
for a long time very serious

834.0 --> 838.8
suddenly you come in and then break it

836.959 --> 839.76
all apart and start yelling at me again

838.8 --> 842.959
like

839.76 --> 844.26
like shut up you old coot

842.959 --> 846.4799999999999
i'll just leave then

844.26 --> 848.56
[Music]

846.48 --> 850.24
and then i did leave and then i went for

848.56 --> 852.0
groceries or something i came back and

850.24 --> 854.16
then he was gone again

852.0 --> 854.16
so

855.279 --> 858.56
like john just needs to get breakfast

857.36 --> 861.44
before he gets on

858.56 --> 862.2399999999999
like just don't don't get on until

861.44 --> 865.519
you've eaten

862.24 --> 865.519
because it's really annoying

869.199 --> 873.76
okay dark steve 84 welcome back

875.76 --> 882.72
i stray from the script

879.04 --> 899.8389999999999
george sanford what what script

882.72 --> 899.839
what is this script you're talking about

910.45 --> 927.839
[Music]

924.839 --> 927.839
hmm

930.72 --> 936.8000000000001
oh nathan hasn't qe has no

934.48 --> 938.0790000000001
not really well kiwi does stick to a bit

936.8 --> 941.3599999999999
of a script

938.079 --> 944.6389999999999
that's just what he's learned and then

941.36 --> 946.8000000000001
the problems that are in there

944.639 --> 948.0
he doesn't really want to address that

946.8 --> 950.8
so he just goes

948.0 --> 950.8
gets angry

951.839 --> 955.519
like with the light situation this is

954.0 --> 958.639
very obvious

955.519 --> 960.9590000000001
i'm just really trying to find new

958.639 --> 963.04
depths i'm just continuing the fractal

960.959 --> 964.959
digging

963.04 --> 967.519
so i don't really have a script my

964.959 --> 982.959
script is creation

967.519 --> 987.04
i'm just digging through it

982.959 --> 991.5999999999999
right yeah brandon what yeah

987.04 --> 994.56
well you know it's true

991.6 --> 994.5600000000001
i say something

995.6 --> 999.759
and then they kind of like shoved me to

997.759 --> 1001.839
the side don't really address it

999.759 --> 1004.0
i i noticed that a lot by the way that i

1001.839 --> 1005.519
just put in a point and then concisely

1004.0 --> 1007.759
and then people just

1005.519 --> 1009.44
continue on with something else like

1007.759 --> 1011.92
they didn't hear me

1009.44 --> 1012.72
i've noticed that happening too like

1011.92 --> 1015.68
that

1012.72 --> 1017.9200000000001
actually annoys me more than when people

1015.68 --> 1020.0
are just rumpaci

1017.92 --> 1021.68
and sometimes now i do like say like

1020.0 --> 1023.68
hello

1021.68 --> 1027.6
did anybody catch what i actually said

1023.68 --> 1027.6
you're just watching over it

1028.48 --> 1032.959
and then i get to hear like the person

1031.12 --> 1037.1989999999998
watching over it making excuse

1032.959 --> 1040.27
often 10th man everybody knows by now

1037.199 --> 1044.14
typically likes to do that

1040.27 --> 1044.1399999999999
[Music]

1046.319 --> 1052.96
okay it's my

1050.84 --> 1057.12
background

1052.96 --> 1062.24
occupation you in or currently i'm into

1057.12 --> 1062.2399999999998
social media i have a youtube show

1064.48 --> 1070.64
and most things that i do are basically

1067.52 --> 1073.76
in the realm of the mind so

1070.64 --> 1076.7990000000002
i'm a as you say colloquial theorist

1073.76 --> 1081.28
i like to think of myself as a

1076.799 --> 1083.6
very serious hobbyist physicist

1081.28 --> 1084.32
although yeah what when is a theory yeah

1083.6 --> 1087.4399999999998
is

1084.32 --> 1089.6
a physicist a hobbyist and when are they

1087.44 --> 1091.76
professional it's kind of difficult

1089.6 --> 1094.9599999999998
because i do teach

1091.76 --> 1097.2
people about what i've learned part of

1094.96 --> 1097.2
that

1098.32 --> 1102.799
and yeah in the past i've been a

1100.08 --> 1102.799
goldsmith

1103.039 --> 1106.48
that's yeah i that's really something

1105.679 --> 1108.72
that i did

1106.48 --> 1110.96
i'd would like to do it again sometimes

1108.72 --> 1112.96
but yeah goldsmithing too was kind of

1110.96 --> 1115.44
weird to me because it

1112.96 --> 1116.72
really depended on do i have inspiration

1115.44 --> 1120.4
do i have the resources

1116.72 --> 1122.559
do it and then after usually i finish

1120.4 --> 1124.64
the project i would be

1122.559 --> 1127.039
sometimes months where i just like

1124.64 --> 1129.5200000000002
really didn't feel like doing anything

1127.039 --> 1131.679
with goldsmithing because just i did not

1129.52 --> 1134.0
really have inspiration for anything

1131.679 --> 1136.4
and would then almost desperately try to

1134.0 --> 1138.4
figure out something interesting

1136.4 --> 1140.0800000000002
and then just drop it it's like ah this

1138.4 --> 1141.679
is too annoying i'll just

1140.08 --> 1144.1599999999999
start to do something else maybe

1141.679 --> 1148.8400000000001
eventually i'll get a new idea

1144.16 --> 1150.0
so as a profession it was not very

1148.84 --> 1153.36
effective

1150.0 --> 1155.52
now as a creative hobby it was great

1153.36 --> 1158.3999999999999
it's great to be able to make really

1155.52 --> 1158.4
amazing things

1159.12 --> 1164.0
and i would like to do that again but i

1161.84 --> 1166.3999999999999
never really made a living or anything

1164.0 --> 1166.4
with it

1168.4 --> 1171.52
yes like smelting down gold although i

1170.88 --> 1174.7990000000002
rarely

1171.52 --> 1176.48
did that casting gold i have done it

1174.799 --> 1180.799
though i made a

1176.48 --> 1183.76
special golden pendulum for somebody

1180.799 --> 1184.32
like that that was interesting because

1183.76 --> 1188.48
it was

1184.32 --> 1190.84
from uh what is it again yeah from

1188.48 --> 1193.84
a special ring from like their

1190.84 --> 1193.84
grandmother

1194.32 --> 1197.84
and they wanted a golden pendulum so i

1196.4 --> 1201.52
made

1197.84 --> 1204.6399999999999
melted melted that ring

1201.52 --> 1207.12
and then turned it into that pendulum i

1204.64 --> 1209.5200000000002
was loved doing that sort of thing

1207.12 --> 1211.4399999999998
and i did repairs a little but it was

1209.52 --> 1214.559
just as a favor like i'm not gonna

1211.44 --> 1216.64
i wasn't like trying to hoard money with

1214.559 --> 1218.32
my actions i was just trying to figure

1216.64 --> 1222.4
out how does this work how

1218.32 --> 1222.3999999999999
do people get happy and

1222.559 --> 1226.8799999999999
i would do orders but those orders were

1226.24 --> 1229.44
always

1226.88 --> 1229.919
a lot of hassle to me because i had to

1229.44 --> 1232.559
like

1229.919 --> 1234.24
get the money numbers right in order not

1232.559 --> 1237.6789999999999
to make a loss

1234.24 --> 1238.88
and to still still seem like a decent

1237.679 --> 1240.48
person

1238.88 --> 1242.3200000000002
and i've always thought that part was

1240.48 --> 1247.039
very difficult but i did have

1242.32 --> 1250.08
orders i made several rings

1247.039 --> 1253.6
like hangers pendants

1250.08 --> 1258.6399999999999
i mean and yeah

1253.6 --> 1260.8799999999999
bracelet and did a lot of repairs

1258.64 --> 1262.3200000000002
and beside that i just did my own bigger

1260.88 --> 1265.0390000000002
projects but i never sold

1262.32 --> 1265.039
anything like that

1273.36 --> 1277.84
somebody said why is this

1278.2 --> 1286.24
shillology oh that's

1281.76 --> 1286.24
really silly why would you study that

1287.28 --> 1293.12
that's like a complete waste of time why

1290.32 --> 1293.12
would you study

1293.52 --> 1299.12
shills that's really a waste of time

1296.96 --> 1301.28
because she'll the show is just so

1299.12 --> 1301.84
simple it's just basically a corporate

1301.28 --> 1305.6789999999999
action

1301.84 --> 1308.799
it's like a very simple acting job

1305.679 --> 1311.76
you know it's like

1308.799 --> 1312.6399999999999
advertisement chilling is very close to

1311.76 --> 1315.28
just

1312.64 --> 1317.039
an ad like an advertisement role that's

1315.28 --> 1320.0
it

1317.039 --> 1321.2
why would you study that and why am i

1320.0 --> 1324.48
taking some

1321.2 --> 1327.52
obvious global trolls serious

1324.48 --> 1330.24
because i'm bored i need subjects people

1327.52 --> 1333.76
for [ __ ] sake

1330.24 --> 1337.76
right j m l j m

1333.76 --> 1340.96
laylor i said yeah it was a good

1337.76 --> 1340.96
it was good to do that

1343.12 --> 1348.6399999999999
being a goldsmith i'm very happy that i

1345.2 --> 1348.64
have that in my skill range

1353.2 --> 1358.72
but i've always just been a big talker i

1357.039 --> 1361.919
always freaking talk

1358.72 --> 1364.159
like it's been a problem in the past

1361.919 --> 1365.76
where basically my friends i would

1364.159 --> 1367.919
always have to size up like

1365.76 --> 1368.96
how much are they interested in what i'm

1367.919 --> 1371.1200000000001
talking about

1368.96 --> 1373.44
because if they're not i'm gonna have a

1371.12 --> 1374.8799999999999
hard time basically shutting myself up

1373.44 --> 1378.4
constantly

1374.88 --> 1381.44
because it's going to piss them off so

1378.4 --> 1383.679
why not get a little bit more productive

1381.44 --> 1386.88
with my blabbering nature

1383.679 --> 1388.0
and just do a show where i just blabber

1386.88 --> 1391.2800000000002
on and then maybe that

1388.0 --> 1392.799
blabber tendency can find a bit of a

1391.28 --> 1394.48
place

1392.799 --> 1396.1589999999999
in a productive way where people

1394.48 --> 1397.76
actually expect you to keep on

1396.159 --> 1401.7600000000002
blabbering on

1397.76 --> 1404.24
and then hopefully it'll be interesting

1401.76 --> 1404.799
so that's why i'm doing this now hey and

1404.24 --> 1406.96
it this

1404.799 --> 1410.559
is actually working out much better than

1406.96 --> 1410.559
anything i've ever done before

1411.919 --> 1415.6000000000001
and that's why i say yeah this is kind

1414.32 --> 1417.76
of professional

1415.6 --> 1419.36
oh people on the global side especially

1417.76 --> 1420.64
are going to find this show and then say

1419.36 --> 1422.0
oh this is ridiculous

1420.64 --> 1424.48
you're wasting your time when did you

1422.0 --> 1425.919
get a real job well that's very funny i

1424.48 --> 1428.96
know but this is probably

1425.919 --> 1433.44
my most successful

1428.96 --> 1437.52
job exploit in my lifetime

1433.44 --> 1441.52
it's the longest running by far

1437.52 --> 1444.4
on a daily basis including sunday

1441.52 --> 1446.24
that's i've never done anything close to

1444.4 --> 1450.0
this

1446.24 --> 1452.559
so yeah i think this is my profession

1450.0 --> 1454.32
my main profession at least i'm trying

1452.559 --> 1456.96
to get around with it i'm getting better

1454.32 --> 1460.3999999999999
at it i have provable skills

1456.96 --> 1464.799
i have gathered a lot of good knowledge

1460.4 --> 1468.0
that is very usable in the field

1464.799 --> 1470.4
that i deal with so yeah

1468.0 --> 1472.08
this is my profession oh you don't like

1470.4 --> 1474.72
that profession you don't want to give

1472.08 --> 1478.3999999999999
recognition that it is actually a thing

1474.72 --> 1480.32
or too bad for you because

1478.4 --> 1482.0
i'm doing it i'm not going to stop

1480.32 --> 1485.039
because other people don't think it's a

1482.0 --> 1485.039
worthy profession

1485.12 --> 1488.9599999999998
because i think there's plenty people

1486.88 --> 1490.0800000000002
around that do think it's a worthy

1488.96 --> 1494.559
profession worth

1490.08 --> 1494.559
following sometimes on a daily basis

1495.76 --> 1502.72
so yeah too bad for you guys

1499.36 --> 1502.7199999999998
because i'm here to stay

1503.84 --> 1510.6399999999999
and i'm here to stay and make fun

1506.96 --> 1513.2
of the globe concept

1510.64 --> 1514.0800000000002
and how sloppy it is and how the

1513.2 --> 1516.559
psychology

1514.08 --> 1518.48
maneuvers around all the mistakes that

1516.559 --> 1521.6
it inherently has

1518.48 --> 1522.64
in order to make it to continue making

1521.6 --> 1526.0
it seem

1522.64 --> 1529.5200000000002
like it is a well founded

1526.0 --> 1529.919
whole thing that is complete which it is

1529.52 --> 1543.76
not

1529.919 --> 1547.52
by a long shot

1543.76 --> 1550.64
i'll debate for fun if you like

1547.52 --> 1552.72
what i want if anyone

1550.64 --> 1554.4
gets angry well i don't really need a

1552.72 --> 1556.24
baller

1554.4 --> 1558.48
i think there's plenty of ballers that

1556.24 --> 1562.24
are very eager to

1558.48 --> 1564.799
express their discontent with flat earth

1562.24 --> 1567.6
in my activities in chat

1564.799 --> 1568.72
that i don't necessarily immediately ban

1567.6 --> 1572.3999999999999
like this

1568.72 --> 1576.0
thirst for truth figure

1572.4 --> 1579.76
in my chat right

1576.0 --> 1582.88
and people like simon dan and all those

1579.76 --> 1584.48
silly people on the internet they're

1582.88 --> 1587.5200000000002
still welcome here it's just that

1584.48 --> 1590.48
you need to behave

1587.52 --> 1591.44
within a certain way and if you move

1590.48 --> 1593.6
outside of that

1591.44 --> 1596.88
yeah then i'm gonna just ban you because

1593.6 --> 1599.52
i don't really tolerate misbehavior

1596.88 --> 1600.0800000000002
you know you can have feelings you can

1599.52 --> 1602.24
have

1600.08 --> 1604.48
negative feelings and express them to a

1602.24 --> 1607.2
certain limit but if you're just gonna

1604.48 --> 1608.4
add home attack or get disgusting then

1607.2 --> 1613.8400000000001
yeah then it's over

1608.4 --> 1613.8400000000001
quickly and like especially don't

1614.159 --> 1620.64
disrespect me if we're in a

1618.24 --> 1622.96
conversation if i am responding to you

1620.64 --> 1625.039
and you eventually end up with just like

1622.96 --> 1626.0
oh screw you you're stupid or something

1625.039 --> 1630.4
that's

1626.0 --> 1630.4
well that's a really silly thing to do

1630.48 --> 1647.039
but anyway you gotta figure it out

1641.52 --> 1647.039
i know a good boy what

1647.919 --> 1653.2
make a pretty mean flat earth argument

1650.559 --> 1656.72
that's hard to argue with okay

1653.2 --> 1656.72
well what is that

1662.64 --> 1668.24
what don't be sorry i'm just asking

1666.08 --> 1669.6
you said you got a really good flat

1668.24 --> 1672.64
earth argument

1669.6 --> 1672.6399999999999
oh i'd like to hear it

1677.76 --> 1682.32
i made one yesterday or was it the day

1681.039 --> 1686.399
before

1682.32 --> 1690.1589999999999
i it was in the restream so

1686.399 --> 1692.7199999999998
that must have been friday

1690.159 --> 1694.88
about the helium balloon in the vomit

1692.72 --> 1697.84
comet setup

1694.88 --> 1701.3600000000001
something i realized should happen

1697.84 --> 1703.4399999999998
that's something that i brought forth

1701.36 --> 1705.039
so i come up with these ideas sometimes

1703.44 --> 1711.8400000000001
and then it's interesting to

1705.039 --> 1711.84
deal with that to to talk about it

1713.84 --> 1721.9189999999999
okay math against glo okay then now

1716.88 --> 1725.3600000000001
what oh wait you're a glower

1721.919 --> 1727.76
okay that's weird that's very very weird

1725.36 --> 1729.9189999999999
why would you be glober

1727.76 --> 1731.44
if you actually realize flat earth

1729.919 --> 1739.1200000000001
arguments that is just

1731.44 --> 1743.2
very odd

1739.12 --> 1747.6
i mean do you actually

1743.2 --> 1749.6000000000001
understand the flat earth

1747.6 --> 1750.8799999999999
because there's still problems with it

1749.6 --> 1754.799
among flat earthers

1750.88 --> 1754.7990000000002
in reifying a certain model

1755.039 --> 1759.2
not realizing the mistakes they make

1764.84 --> 1771.84
therein

1767.76 --> 1774.32
okay well could you explain to me why

1771.84 --> 1774.8799999999999
why you still think the earth is a globe

1774.32 --> 1778.559
after

1774.88 --> 1781.919
everything that's been discussed

1778.559 --> 1784.1589999999999
in the years why would you think that

1781.919 --> 1785.039
what makes you believe it is a globe do

1784.159 --> 1788.3200000000002
you think it's a

1785.039 --> 1791.52
literal geometrical sphere

1788.32 --> 1793.6
or are you a flat glober

1791.52 --> 1794.6399999999999
which is like the last best hope for a

1793.6 --> 1796.0
globe

1794.64 --> 1799.039
because it is flat the earth is

1796.0 --> 1802.08
absolutely flat but hey the realm

1799.039 --> 1804.24
the container of the rail may be quite

1802.08 --> 1805.36
not so straightforward as everyone would

1804.24 --> 1808.24
like to believe and

1805.36 --> 1809.4399999999998
who knows maybe these surfaces do

1808.24 --> 1812.08
interconnect

1809.44 --> 1812.48
as if it was a geometrical globe it's

1812.08 --> 1815.9189999999999
still

1812.48 --> 1823.84
flat though flat in every sense

1815.919 --> 1823.8400000000001
every evidence reveals that

1825.279 --> 1830.08
are we going to do this for fun well

1827.279 --> 1830.08
that depends

1830.48 --> 1836.24
i'm genuine genuinely inquiring here

1833.76 --> 1839.84
dark steve

1836.24 --> 1842.88
i'm asking you to dig inside and

1839.84 --> 1844.32
basically share with us why you think

1842.88 --> 1851.8400000000001
the earth is a glow

1844.32 --> 1851.84
do you really

1853.2 --> 1856.96
what you think that if you're going to

1855.2 --> 1859.1200000000001
be honest i'm going to punish you for

1856.96 --> 1859.1200000000001
that

1860.24 --> 1863.76
like i'm going to take your wrench away

1862.0 --> 1865.84
if you suddenly get all arrogant and

1863.76 --> 1868.96
annoying and

1865.84 --> 1870.72
whatever hey and if you if you're gonna

1868.96 --> 1872.32
say let's say like yeah it's all very

1870.72 --> 1873.679
cute but i'm basically acting and i

1872.32 --> 1876.8799999999999
think that everything is

1873.679 --> 1878.64
turned 180 degrees inside out and i'm

1876.88 --> 1879.44
just playing my role here well that's

1878.64 --> 1882.5590000000002
pretty damn

1879.44 --> 1884.3990000000001
silly if that was the case still not

1882.559 --> 1886.8799999999999
gonna take your wrench away for that for

1884.399 --> 1888.399
just being honest

1886.88 --> 1890.48
or you couldn't care what the shape of

1888.399 --> 1892.399
the earth is

1890.48 --> 1894.08
okay well if you don't care then why

1892.399 --> 1899.6789999999999
would you say the earth is

1894.08 --> 1899.6789999999999
not flat or a globe if you don't care

1900.399 --> 1906.32
like you not caring

1903.679 --> 1908.88
doesn't exactly give weight to your

1906.32 --> 1908.8799999999999
position

1909.84 --> 1913.279
that you've declared

1916.0 --> 1920.799
or you know it's about it by what and

1918.399 --> 1923.6789999999999
what is this knowledge you speak of what

1920.799 --> 1923.679
is this knowledge

1926.799 --> 1930.96
if you know it's a ball you have a

1928.96 --> 1934.32
telescope

1930.96 --> 1936.3990000000001
all right and so how does this telescope

1934.32 --> 1949.84
provide evidence that you're standing on

1936.399 --> 1949.84
a ball exactly

1954.08 --> 1957.279
but don't worry

1958.08 --> 1964.799
did i complain about your spelling

1961.44 --> 1968.3200000000002
no i didn't i i just

1964.799 --> 1971.12
i'd like to care for you being real

1968.32 --> 1973.039
in my chat if you're gonna say things

1971.12 --> 1977.1999999999998
i'm going to address it

1973.039 --> 1979.679
in every detail like

1977.2 --> 1980.24
you can't just slip things past me just

1979.679 --> 1983.44
saying

1980.24 --> 1985.279
you know that means that you think you

1983.44 --> 1986.96
might run into a point where you can't

1985.279 --> 1988.799
handle it

1986.96 --> 1990.88
and you don't want to go there then just

1988.799 --> 1993.279
say i don't want a debate

1990.88 --> 1994.3200000000002
but you did and you declared you thought

1993.279 --> 1996.32
the earth was a ball

1994.32 --> 1998.1589999999999
and i asked for your evidence for this

1996.32 --> 1999.9189999999999
you said telescopes and then i said okay

1998.159 --> 2000.88
so how does that actually provide the

1999.919 --> 2003.44
evidence

2000.88 --> 2004.0
i just want to know how this is working

2003.44 --> 2006.24
inside

2004.0 --> 2006.24
you

2013.679 --> 2019.8400000000001
you don't have to type fast

2025.2 --> 2029.76
oh so you don't think it is fun for me

2028.24 --> 2032.24
to basically inquire

2029.76 --> 2034.72
with you why you think the earth is a

2032.24 --> 2039.84
globe does that make you uncomfortable

2034.72 --> 2039.84
inquiring for your evidence

2041.679 --> 2045.039
you are noticing i'm not just

2043.2 --> 2048.96
straightforward attacking you

2045.039 --> 2049.839
right with the main absolute arguments i

2048.96 --> 2053.599
could do that

2049.839 --> 2056.0
but i'm not i'm just asking for you why

2053.599 --> 2058.639
what makes you really believe i'm making

2056.0 --> 2060.56
you question your own belief

2058.639 --> 2064.879
and the evidence on which that belief

2060.56 --> 2064.879
rests for you to contemplate

2066.32 --> 2071.04
right so that's cute but could you

2069.52 --> 2075.359
please

2071.04 --> 2078.96
respond to the question

2075.359 --> 2081.2799999999997
why do you think that your telescope

2078.96 --> 2082.8
provides how do you think that your

2081.28 --> 2085.2000000000003
telescope provides

2082.8 --> 2086.3990000000003
the evidence that the earth is a ball

2085.2 --> 2088.1589999999997
that you're standing on

2086.399 --> 2090.48
can you explain that to me how that

2088.159 --> 2090.48
works

2091.2 --> 2096.6389999999997
or if you can't what exactly was the

2094.56 --> 2102.13
moment that convinced you

2096.639 --> 2103.92
what exactly convinced you

2102.13 --> 2107.119
[Music]

2103.92 --> 2107.119
can you pinpoint it

2110.88 --> 2115.92
why is everything else a bow

2114.079 --> 2118.1600000000003
what makes you say everything else is a

2115.92 --> 2118.16
ball

2119.52 --> 2123.28
but not us what makes you say everything

2122.16 --> 2131.839
else is a ball

2123.28 --> 2131.8390000000004
dark steve

2134.16 --> 2139.2
you have seen personally what that

2137.359 --> 2145.68
everything else is a ball how did you

2139.2 --> 2149.52
see that

2145.68 --> 2151.839
now don't get in the way

2149.52 --> 2154.24
george stanford you have a huge

2151.839 --> 2157.68
telescope okay so you look

2154.24 --> 2160.72
at the sky probably at night

2157.68 --> 2163.7599999999998
and you saw the moon and you saw

2160.72 --> 2164.8799999999997
planets stars all these celestial

2163.76 --> 2169.3590000000004
phenomenon

2164.88 --> 2172.4
phenomena right and they were all

2169.359 --> 2174.96
like dots and discs

2172.4 --> 2176.079
and the moon yeah looks really weird i

2174.96 --> 2179.2
agree

2176.079 --> 2181.52
so how is that proof

2179.2 --> 2183.1189999999997
that they're all spheres exactly explain

2181.52 --> 2186.4
to me how that works you see

2183.119 --> 2186.96
something in the sky and then you say

2186.4 --> 2190.56
okay

2186.96 --> 2193.04
well i see they're all disks

2190.56 --> 2194.48
that's the visual literal thing that

2193.04 --> 2196.16
you're seeing about it that's the

2194.48 --> 2199.599
evidence you have you see these

2196.16 --> 2200.0789999999997
celestial light based things and then

2199.599 --> 2203.04
it's like

2200.079 --> 2204.6400000000003
yeah so they are all balls because you

2203.04 --> 2208.48
assume they are

2204.64 --> 2210.3199999999997
i guess and then because you assume that

2208.48 --> 2211.359
all these things you see in the sky are

2210.32 --> 2213.28
balls

2211.359 --> 2215.04
without any actual evidence by the way

2213.28 --> 2216.88
you just see something and then you

2215.04 --> 2219.44
assume it's a ball

2216.88 --> 2221.76
that means that this thing you're

2219.44 --> 2224.8
standing on must also be a ball

2221.76 --> 2226.1600000000003
seems kind of a jump to conclusions

2224.8 --> 2228.96
there because

2226.16 --> 2229.92
what evidence do you actually have to

2228.96 --> 2232.0
confirm

2229.92 --> 2234.16
any of the things you saw in the heavens

2232.0 --> 2243.839
were balls

2234.16 --> 2243.839
can you share that with me dark steve

2247.89 --> 2251.0099999999998
[Music]

2252.8 --> 2259.909
curve of the moon really

2256.23 --> 2259.909
[Music]

2261.28 --> 2265.44
so if you think that the moon is a ball

2263.52 --> 2267.28
then why does it look the way it does

2265.44 --> 2268.7200000000003
why does it have the shadows in the way

2267.28 --> 2273.0400000000004
it does

2268.72 --> 2276.7999999999997
when every evidence that we can

2273.04 --> 2279.839
actually try to yeah emulate this

2276.8 --> 2282.48
that assumption with here on earth shows

2279.839 --> 2285.2799999999997
that when you shine light on a ball

2282.48 --> 2285.599
it never looks like that not even close

2285.28 --> 2288.2400000000002
it

2285.599 --> 2290.6400000000003
never ever looks like that there's

2288.24 --> 2292.9599999999996
always a light to shadow gradient

2290.64 --> 2295.68
when you shine a light on a ball so

2292.96 --> 2295.68
explain that

2296.48 --> 2302.72
did you just assume

2300.24 --> 2305.2799999999997
that the moon is very special and that

2302.72 --> 2308.48
the shadows and all that

2305.28 --> 2312.8
that that is close enough

2308.48 --> 2315.119
because if you ever try to test

2312.8 --> 2316.1600000000003
that in the physical world right in

2315.119 --> 2319.119
front of you

2316.16 --> 2320.7999999999997
with a ball maybe you have a print of a

2319.119 --> 2323.839
moon on it

2320.8 --> 2325.8390000000004
and then you take a flashlight at a

2323.839 --> 2327.119
great distance at a short distance and

2325.839 --> 2329.839
you shine it onto it

2327.119 --> 2331.359
it never looks like that it never looks

2329.839 --> 2334.88
the way the moon looks

2331.359 --> 2337.04
ever there's no way to do that

2334.88 --> 2339.04
because there's always because it's a

2337.04 --> 2341.7599999999998
sphere there's always

2339.04 --> 2344.48
a shadow gradient there's no hard cut

2341.76 --> 2346.1600000000003
shadow line

2344.48 --> 2347.92
that never happens when you shine a

2346.16 --> 2351.1189999999997
light on a ball

2347.92 --> 2351.119
have you ever realized that

2353.2 --> 2359.5989999999997
title clock so you're not exactly

2357.2 --> 2368.64
addressing

2359.599 --> 2370.6400000000003
what i've been saying

2368.64 --> 2372.64
okay oh you're not really addressing

2370.64 --> 2374.48
what i've just said

2372.64 --> 2377.04
so you got different shots of the moon

2374.48 --> 2380.88
so do i got many interesting shots

2377.04 --> 2381.2799999999997
the p900 but yeah when you actually

2380.88 --> 2383.599
cross

2381.28 --> 2386.48
reference it with shining a light on an

2383.599 --> 2390.1600000000003
actual physical provable ball

2386.48 --> 2392.64
that you can approach it never looks

2390.16 --> 2392.64
like that

2395.2 --> 2399.1189999999997
yeah i know i know it's very easy to now

2398.32 --> 2400.96
reply to

2399.119 --> 2402.6400000000003
everybody else that gets in chat and

2400.96 --> 2405.28
tries to get involved in this very

2402.64 --> 2407.5989999999997
careful process that i'm engaging it

2405.28 --> 2409.599
effectively helping the person i'm

2407.599 --> 2410.48
talking with to get distracted thanks a

2409.599 --> 2413.599
lot

2410.48 --> 2417.28
right but i would still like you to

2413.599 --> 2420.56
address my question why do you think

2417.28 --> 2422.3190000000004
the moon is a ball when you take a ball

2420.56 --> 2423.68
shine a light on it and whatever

2422.319 --> 2425.92
distance it never

2423.68 --> 2426.96
looks the way the moon looks in any

2425.92 --> 2430.2400000000002
state

2426.96 --> 2430.2400000000002
so how do you explain that

2437.599 --> 2440.96
yeah sure they're very different but

2440.0 --> 2443.68
it's still

2440.96 --> 2445.599
light shining on things right if you

2443.68 --> 2447.9199999999996
take a ball and you let the sunlight

2445.599 --> 2449.3590000000004
shine on it it also doesn't look like

2447.92 --> 2453.76
that at all

2449.359 --> 2456.72
so that's not really an argument

2453.76 --> 2457.6800000000003
it's just light light shining on a

2456.72 --> 2461.359
sphere

2457.68 --> 2464.8799999999997
does not look the way the moon looks

2461.359 --> 2467.04
ever it doesn't look like that

2464.88 --> 2468.1600000000003
i know there's this weird supposed

2467.04 --> 2470.8
shadow play

2468.16 --> 2472.3999999999996
with the presumed to be craters on there

2470.8 --> 2475.44
it's very surreal

2472.4 --> 2478.56
right it's not

2475.44 --> 2481.68
actual proof of a physical ball

2478.56 --> 2484.96
that is being shown upon by light

2481.68 --> 2485.52
it's not it's just a surreal holographic

2484.96 --> 2488.48
play

2485.52 --> 2490.72
you get to see it's not proof of a

2488.48 --> 2493.68
sphere hanging there

2490.72 --> 2494.7999999999997
because when you actually take a

2493.68 --> 2497.2
confirmed sphere

2494.8 --> 2498.4
shine lights on it in whatever fashion

2497.2 --> 2501.839
it never

2498.4 --> 2509.839
looks that way there's never a hard edge

2501.839 --> 2509.839
shadow there isn't

2512.16 --> 2516.8799999999997
this is all very cute but you're not

2514.0 --> 2519.44
really addressing

2516.88 --> 2520.48
my statement here you're just making up

2519.44 --> 2523.68
excuses now

2520.48 --> 2526.2400000000002
just because you're not

2523.68 --> 2528.72
actually yeah i have a point there

2526.24 --> 2528.72
that's right

2529.04 --> 2536.24
so think about that it's just

2533.68 --> 2538.0
you want it to be a sphere and it's

2536.24 --> 2541.04
close enough

2538.0 --> 2541.68
to you not realizing what actually

2541.04 --> 2544.4
happens

2541.68 --> 2545.7599999999998
physically when you shine light on a

2544.4 --> 2548.079
sphere

2545.76 --> 2550.2400000000002
there's a light shadow gradient

2548.079 --> 2551.6800000000003
naturally because of the spherical

2550.24 --> 2555.359
surface

2551.68 --> 2558.3999999999996
it's very specific event that transpires

2555.359 --> 2562.72
with light shining on a sphere

2558.4 --> 2562.7200000000003
well the moon does not match it it just

2562.839 --> 2565.839
doesn't

2566.16 --> 2570.0789999999997
so think about that before you assume

2569.76 --> 2572.079
that

2570.079 --> 2574.0
everything we're looking at is a sphere

2572.079 --> 2574.8
so why would the earth be different then

2574.0 --> 2577.28
well

2574.8 --> 2578.7200000000003
because you just assume these celestial

2577.28 --> 2580.96
lights are a sphere

2578.72 --> 2583.1189999999997
because at some point you kind of

2580.96 --> 2586.4
thought like

2583.119 --> 2588.88
but what else is it if not a sphere

2586.4 --> 2590.96
even though it doesn't actually match

2588.88 --> 2593.92
light physics with spheres

2590.96 --> 2595.839
it doesn't match the same pattern but

2593.92 --> 2598.88
you went there anyway

2595.839 --> 2600.56
and then that means that you will just

2598.88 --> 2601.6800000000003
assume everything must be a sphere

2600.56 --> 2604.4
because the moon is

2601.68 --> 2605.68
close enough in your opinion to be like

2604.4 --> 2607.6800000000003
a sphere

2605.68 --> 2609.44
without any actual physical evidence

2607.68 --> 2612.16
mind you just the visuals

2609.44 --> 2613.44
just saying this is the train of thought

2612.16 --> 2616.24
that is your foundation

2613.44 --> 2618.96
i guess because you looked at it through

2616.24 --> 2618.9599999999996
a telescope

2619.68 --> 2635.839
and you can ask a question respectively

2622.64 --> 2635.839
if you like

2643.04 --> 2647.04
no rare opportunity no it doesn't

2647.599 --> 2652.48
you're a liar you can [ __ ] off

2658.64 --> 2663.2799999999997
auto wow okay well helicopter can easily

2661.839 --> 2665.92
do an audio rotation

2663.28 --> 2666.5600000000004
because of relative density it's very

2665.92 --> 2668.4
easy

2666.56 --> 2670.64
there is no gravity there's no need for

2668.4 --> 2673.76
gravity relative density

2670.64 --> 2675.52
perfectly describes the division

2673.76 --> 2678.1600000000003
of the dense and the less dense

2675.52 --> 2679.839
materials within the realms confine

2678.16 --> 2681.52
it perfectly describes it and it

2679.839 --> 2690.72
perfectly explains

2681.52 --> 2694.96
lift all that it's very easy

2690.72 --> 2694.9599999999996
right chandler bing you get it

2695.68 --> 2699.68
no not gravity is not a forces gravity

2699.2 --> 2702.56
just

2699.68 --> 2705.359
doesn't exist it's not required if you

2702.56 --> 2708.16
want an explanation why

2705.359 --> 2710.16
would you bring in gravity as a flat

2708.16 --> 2712.7999999999997
earther that's just

2710.16 --> 2714.72
it's a dumb approach because now you're

2712.8 --> 2716.5600000000004
gonna make the discussion about whether

2714.72 --> 2720.3999999999996
gravity is real

2716.56 --> 2721.839
when you can just say you don't need it

2720.4 --> 2724.48
there's something better that is

2721.839 --> 2727.2
actually scientifically provable

2724.48 --> 2728.2400000000002
and much more complete because it takes

2727.2 --> 2731.5989999999997
account

2728.24 --> 2732.0789999999997
for gases it does relative density

2731.599 --> 2734.319
actually

2732.079 --> 2736.319
includes gases within the model which

2734.319 --> 2739.2799999999997
gravity does not

2736.319 --> 2741.2799999999997
it doesn't and that stems from the old

2739.28 --> 2743.76
newtonian

2741.28 --> 2745.0400000000004
mechanical displacement based way of

2743.76 --> 2747.6800000000003
thinking

2745.04 --> 2748.319
he did not include gases people he never

2747.68 --> 2749.5989999999997
did

2748.319 --> 2752.48
it's not in there it's not even

2749.599 --> 2753.839
addressed it's not addressed within his

2752.48 --> 2757.52
physics

2753.839 --> 2759.52
you understand or you can prove me wrong

2757.52 --> 2761.599
if you can find some place in newtonian

2759.52 --> 2765.04
mechanics where he actually addressed

2761.599 --> 2766.48
gases at all be very curious to hear

2765.04 --> 2768.24
about that

2766.48 --> 2770.0
you gotta realize that every time

2768.24 --> 2772.72
gravity is brought

2770.0 --> 2773.119
into the mechanics of things to explain

2772.72 --> 2776.72
it

2773.119 --> 2778.6400000000003
it's incomplete it always was incomplete

2776.72 --> 2780.319
and then they even migrated into

2778.64 --> 2781.68
complete conceptual nonsense with

2780.319 --> 2783.92
einstein

2781.68 --> 2785.2
it's just not necessary because relative

2783.92 --> 2788.8
density perfectly

2785.2 --> 2792.8799999999997
explains every all passive motion

2788.8 --> 2792.88
that transpires within the realm all of

2796.2 --> 2799.3399999999997
[Music]

2800.839 --> 2803.839
it

2814.64 --> 2818.319
all right well this dark steve's at

2816.48 --> 2820.72
least

2818.319 --> 2821.44
very respectful i approac i appreciate

2820.72 --> 2825.2
that

2821.44 --> 2825.2000000000003
i will give you some credit for that

2828.839 --> 2831.839
hmm

2833.68 --> 2838.96
yeah i know you'd love to now deviate

2836.48 --> 2838.96
away

2840.48 --> 2845.359
i'm just addressing that you are you are

2843.76 --> 2849.2000000000003
aware that you are just

2845.359 --> 2852.48
at this point believing in a vision

2849.2 --> 2855.2
of heliocentrism that you don't have

2852.48 --> 2858.079
actual evidence for that

2855.2 --> 2860.0789999999997
and then does that make you feel

2858.079 --> 2865.6800000000003
uncomfortable

2860.079 --> 2868.319
why do you hold on have you not seen

2865.68 --> 2870.0789999999997
there is a whole not another way to deal

2868.319 --> 2872.8
with it

2870.079 --> 2873.2000000000003
and that it won't automatically make you

2872.8 --> 2876.0
turn

2873.2 --> 2877.359
into one of the weirdo attention drawing

2876.0 --> 2881.68
weirdos out there

2877.359 --> 2884.48
which are also there among flat earthers

2881.68 --> 2887.52
it's up to you if you go there what you

2884.48 --> 2888.96
are going to make yourself into

2887.52 --> 2891.119
what are you going to turn into a

2888.96 --> 2892.96
mockery of your former self or whether

2891.119 --> 2893.599
you're going to actually ascend and

2892.96 --> 2897.359
become

2893.599 --> 2899.04
greater than you were with the

2897.359 --> 2900.48
knowledge of what is real and what is

2899.04 --> 2902.8
not that you have attained

2900.48 --> 2906.16
for yourself for your spirit it's really

2902.8 --> 2907.76
all about the spirit awareness of

2906.16 --> 2911.5989999999997
are you following something that you

2907.76 --> 2911.599
cannot prove a belief

2913.119 --> 2919.76
why do you believe it because

2916.4 --> 2920.7200000000003
there are arguments for this is

2919.76 --> 2922.559
philosophy

2920.72 --> 2924.48
for believing in something you cannot

2922.559 --> 2929.44
prove if

2924.48 --> 2931.68
you have a good reason for it right

2929.44 --> 2933.68
there is there is things to say for

2931.68 --> 2934.72
believing in something that you cannot

2933.68 --> 2937.359
prove

2934.72 --> 2939.359
but not always if you don't have a good

2937.359 --> 2940.88
reason for it then why do you hang on is

2939.359 --> 2943.359
it because you fear

2940.88 --> 2944.0
is it because you are nostalgic because

2943.359 --> 2947.7599999999998
you

2944.0 --> 2950.64
are free yeah you don't want to feelings

2947.76 --> 2953.3590000000004
it is the reason feelings or do you have

2950.64 --> 2956.48
a really good reason

2953.359 --> 2957.2
that is grounded in philosophy that you

2956.48 --> 2960.0
could

2957.2 --> 2962.16
basically truly make people stave off

2960.0 --> 2964.079
that question because you gave a good

2962.16 --> 2967.2799999999997
philosophical reason as to why you

2964.079 --> 2969.44
believe it you know just like

2967.28 --> 2970.48
might trigger some people just like when

2969.44 --> 2974.0
people

2970.48 --> 2976.559
explain why they believe in jesus christ

2974.0 --> 2977.68
right it's very elaborate complex these

2976.559 --> 2981.92
days

2977.68 --> 2985.52
but yes like that

2981.92 --> 2987.92
that probably makes people understand

2985.52 --> 2989.04
i do believe and there's evidence

2987.92 --> 2991.92
definitely

2989.04 --> 2993.2
but there's also gaps there's always

2991.92 --> 2994.96
gaps

2993.2 --> 2997.1189999999997
i still choose to believe and have a

2994.96 --> 2998.0
very specific philosophical reason to do

2997.119 --> 3001.359
that

2998.0 --> 3003.599
right so i'm just wondering why

3001.359 --> 3004.88
in the face of lack of evidence would

3003.599 --> 3008.48
you believe

3004.88 --> 3010.079
the earth to be a ball what's making you

3008.48 --> 3012.8
hold on to that

3010.079 --> 3015.2000000000003
when you could move on now if you got an

3012.8 --> 3018.079
actual good reason for that

3015.2 --> 3018.96
then i'd say yeah yeah okay okay i get

3018.079 --> 3020.6400000000003
that

3018.96 --> 3022.16
if you don't however and it's just

3020.64 --> 3027.839
feelings

3022.16 --> 3027.839
then you got a choice to make

3034.72 --> 3041.839
all right

3050.24 --> 3057.7599999999998
[Music]

3055.04 --> 3058.48
no a rare opportunity you're a stupid

3057.76 --> 3060.88
baltard

3058.48 --> 3069.839
troll and a wanker get the [ __ ] out

3060.88 --> 3069.839
that's why now you're banned

3069.93 --> 3072.989
[Music]

3077.5 --> 3080.69
[Music]

3080.839 --> 3083.839
uh

3089.04 --> 3096.88
reason can be spiritual well yeah

3092.4 --> 3099.6800000000003
i get that so what is it

3096.88 --> 3102.1600000000003
present your philosophical foundation

3099.68 --> 3105.1189999999997
for your belief

3102.16 --> 3106.5589999999997
right do you have one or is it just

3105.119 --> 3108.559
feelings

3106.559 --> 3110.48
this is my question yeah it's a very

3108.559 --> 3113.52
deep very close to that

3110.48 --> 3114.96
sensitive point question it is the

3113.52 --> 3119.7599999999998
question

3114.96 --> 3119.76
everybody should be asking on every side

3121.599 --> 3126.2400000000002
if you've gotten to a point where you

3123.839 --> 3128.48
figure out that you don't have actual

3126.24 --> 3130.16
physical proof it doesn't even have to

3128.48 --> 3133.599
be scientific

3130.16 --> 3134.8799999999997
method standard just physical empirical

3133.599 --> 3137.44
proof or something

3134.88 --> 3138.0
yet you believe it why do you persist

3137.44 --> 3141.04
believing

3138.0 --> 3141.839
it what is your philosophical reason for

3141.04 --> 3143.68
doing

3141.839 --> 3146.0789999999997
that for believing in something you

3143.68 --> 3149.2799999999997
actually don't have evidence for

3146.079 --> 3153.119
is it feelings or is it an actual

3149.28 --> 3156.96
good reason this is important to do

3153.119 --> 3156.96
for every person out there

3158.8 --> 3163.119
spiritual and also scientific no that's

3160.64 --> 3166.24
not a contradiction at all

3163.119 --> 3169.6800000000003
if you think that's a contradiction then

3166.24 --> 3169.68
you've already got a problem

3171.28 --> 3178.6400000000003
you know because both spiritualism

3175.599 --> 3182.48
not talking yeah it did general version

3178.64 --> 3183.5989999999997
and science science are both about too

3182.48 --> 3187.28
specific

3183.599 --> 3190.2400000000002
one specific thing and that is the truth

3187.28 --> 3192.0
it's just a different angle of approach

3190.24 --> 3195.7599999999998
so they're not contradicting

3192.0 --> 3199.04
contradictions at all the truth

3195.76 --> 3202.2400000000002
is uniform

3199.04 --> 3204.8
and you can find it wherever you look if

3202.24 --> 3204.7999999999997
you look

3204.88 --> 3209.839
you can find it in an esoteric way with

3208.96 --> 3213.359
your spirit

3209.839 --> 3216.88
with your subconscious with

3213.359 --> 3220.88
things that move past your conscious

3216.88 --> 3224.319
cognition or you can mechanically

3220.88 --> 3227.44
derive it from putting physical things

3224.319 --> 3230.48
together and structures

3227.44 --> 3232.8
in the physical realm both approaches

3230.48 --> 3234.839
can yield the truth if that is what

3232.8 --> 3237.8390000000004
you're looking for and that is so

3234.839 --> 3237.839
important

3244.079 --> 3250.88
right so it's not a contradiction really

3247.119 --> 3253.48
i used to think it

3250.88 --> 3255.119
but that's before i found out that

3253.48 --> 3259.52
scientism

3255.119 --> 3264.079
the culture of science supposedly

3259.52 --> 3267.839
that that is actually all a giant lie

3264.079 --> 3267.8390000000004
held together by sophistry

3267.92 --> 3270.96
i didn't realize that at first because

3270.16 --> 3274.0
it's a very

3270.96 --> 3276.0
tough one because it's so big and when

3274.0 --> 3278.0
it's really big you just take it for

3276.0 --> 3281.04
granted and feel like at least there's

3278.0 --> 3283.28
so much more well

3281.04 --> 3284.48
that so much more turns out to be a lot

3283.28 --> 3289.76
of [ __ ]

3284.48 --> 3289.76
[ __ ] and that's a big disappointment

3290.839 --> 3296.319
but the truth in physics in the physical

3294.799 --> 3300.0
reality and the truth

3296.319 --> 3302.96
from within the spirit

3300.0 --> 3303.28
as you face it as you realize it both

3302.96 --> 3308.4
are

3303.28 --> 3310.88
the truth the truth is what it is

3308.4 --> 3313.76
cannot be altered what is true cannot be

3310.88 --> 3313.76
made untrue

3314.72 --> 3321.839
because if it was true then it was true

3317.359 --> 3321.839
that cannot change

3332.839 --> 3335.839
anyway

3336.64 --> 3341.68
yeah because i used to like to think

3339.76 --> 3343.76
that i'm going to build

3341.68 --> 3345.68
i'm going to fill in the gaps like

3343.76 --> 3347.3590000000004
there's so many issues with the spirit

3345.68 --> 3349.68
and consciousness

3347.359 --> 3350.64
and these unique abilities that i

3349.68 --> 3353.68
discovered

3350.64 --> 3356.799
i could do like lay on hands

3353.68 --> 3357.2799999999997
related things magnetizing all that just

3356.799 --> 3360.64
like

3357.28 --> 3363.6800000000003
i this is so palpably here why

3360.64 --> 3365.839
is there no scientific recognition for

3363.68 --> 3368.8799999999997
this at all

3365.839 --> 3371.0789999999997
that frustrated me very much so i set

3368.88 --> 3372.559
out i'm going to build a bridge between

3371.079 --> 3376.0
spiritualism

3372.559 --> 3380.1600000000003
and science i'm going to actually

3376.0 --> 3382.48
united that was like my virtual project

3380.16 --> 3385.92
for myself

3382.48 --> 3385.92
since i was 17

3386.559 --> 3392.7200000000003
and i kind of imprinted that idea

3390.4 --> 3393.76
into the concept of the universal

3392.72 --> 3397.359
pattern

3393.76 --> 3400.7990000000004
patternism that all

3397.359 --> 3403.119
inside all knowledge all of it

3400.799 --> 3403.839
all of reality is a singular pattern or

3403.119 --> 3408.079
could be

3403.839 --> 3408.0789999999997
translated into a singular pattern

3408.72 --> 3414.48
and the pattern would be as the word

3412.319 --> 3415.44
that's now my conclusion because back

3414.48 --> 3418.48
then

3415.44 --> 3420.559
i wasn't too preoccupied with god

3418.48 --> 3422.16
in the picture a creator in the picture

3420.559 --> 3424.079
i wasn't thinking too much about it i

3422.16 --> 3426.319
still believed in the possibility of

3424.079 --> 3427.2000000000003
evolution or that if god was there that

3426.319 --> 3428.48
he was completely

3427.2 --> 3430.24
outside of everything and he made a

3428.48 --> 3432.88
completely self-containing

3430.24 --> 3433.2799999999997
self-creating system i was thinking like

3432.88 --> 3438.4
that

3433.28 --> 3441.52
i would never like exclude god perfectly

3438.4 --> 3443.119
but i would place him as a in a

3441.52 --> 3447.839
non-active role as an

3443.119 --> 3447.839
outsider that just spurred it all forth

3451.599 --> 3464.6400000000003
hey mr salim

3461.839 --> 3465.359
oh yeah all that doctors uh asked about

3464.64 --> 3468.0899999999997
her you hear

3465.359 --> 3471.04
voices yes cute

3468.09 --> 3473.359
[Music]

3471.04 --> 3474.079
i always have to put you in a box like

3473.359 --> 3475.839
that

3474.079 --> 3477.3590000000004
because there's just no recognition for

3475.839 --> 3480.319
any of that and like why

3477.359 --> 3482.16
and how you know there's voices and then

3480.319 --> 3483.359
there's voices and then there's voices

3482.16 --> 3484.8799999999997
and all three are

3483.359 --> 3487.04
radically different have radically

3484.88 --> 3489.359
different influence on you

3487.04 --> 3491.68
now can you figure out how to

3489.359 --> 3494.64
differentiate between it

3491.68 --> 3496.0789999999997
it's kind of important if you wish to

3494.64 --> 3503.839
share

3496.079 --> 3503.8390000000004
that you do

3504.079 --> 3510.559
so i could basically state

3507.52 --> 3513.68
i hear voices but i don't

3510.559 --> 3517.8390000000004
actually hear voices i just

3513.68 --> 3517.839
hear spirit presence

3518.079 --> 3522.2400000000002
like i'm one of those people that really

3520.559 --> 3525.44
notices when somebody's

3522.24 --> 3527.1189999999997
staring at me is captivated in their

3525.44 --> 3528.319
spirit with me to be more precise

3527.119 --> 3530.96
because somebody can just

3528.319 --> 3531.839
stare at me like a dumb cow i won't pick

3530.96 --> 3533.44
that up but if

3531.839 --> 3535.599
i caught their attention and they're

3533.44 --> 3536.48
like really captivated they're trying to

3535.599 --> 3540.7200000000003
figure me out

3536.48 --> 3540.72
i feel it i feel it

3542.839 --> 3549.839
right

3545.68 --> 3549.839
so it's like a voice that's not a voice

3550.559 --> 3553.76
you don't i don't hear like

3553.92 --> 3561.839
i'd never never

3557.52 --> 3561.839
that [ __ ] only happens in dreams for me

3562.16 --> 3566.5589999999997
and then it creeps the [ __ ] out of me

3564.0 --> 3569.599
this is it's usually a sign that

3566.559 --> 3573.52
you're yeah that you are

3569.599 --> 3575.839
joined by outsider spirits

3573.52 --> 3577.2
and that's never really a good thing you

3575.839 --> 3581.04
can get rid of that too

3577.2 --> 3583.2
it's not it's not as dramatic

3581.04 --> 3584.319
as a lot of people are made to believe

3583.2 --> 3586.0
through movie

3584.319 --> 3588.0
excitement and all that dealing with

3586.0 --> 3590.24
spirits which is also dramatic and

3588.0 --> 3590.799
extreme and people die or go completely

3590.24 --> 3592.5589999999997
and say

3590.799 --> 3595.68
yeah yeah that's all very dramatic in

3592.559 --> 3598.96
reality it's actually

3595.68 --> 3600.0789999999997
a lot less extreme although yeah if a

3598.96 --> 3602.559
person really gets

3600.079 --> 3604.6400000000003
lost really gets lost like they can't

3602.559 --> 3607.52
handle anything anymore

3604.64 --> 3609.839
then yeah the darkness will possess them

3607.52 --> 3613.04
and will get pretty damn dramatic

3609.839 --> 3614.799
in order to ensure that the person stays

3613.04 --> 3617.68
hidden

3614.799 --> 3617.68
within their body

3618.96 --> 3622.48
but all these things are just ascribed

3621.28 --> 3624.6400000000003
to natural

3622.48 --> 3626.559
behavior or like oh this is just natural

3624.64 --> 3627.1189999999997
psychotic behavior but there's a pattern

3626.559 --> 3629.3590000000004
to this

3627.119 --> 3630.6400000000003
very specific and that's why i like to

3629.359 --> 3633.68
deal dabble

3630.64 --> 3637.52
into esoterism especially

3633.68 --> 3640.5589999999997
along the lines of rudolph steiner's

3637.52 --> 3644.24
legacy with the concept of lucifer and

3640.559 --> 3644.2400000000002
iron man and the path of christ

3646.88 --> 3653.2000000000003
staying in your body being you

3649.92 --> 3654.839
doing within your life what you are

3653.2 --> 3658.64
supposed to be doing

3654.839 --> 3661.7599999999998
lugos and

3658.64 --> 3664.64
finding your way back to that because

3661.76 --> 3666.7200000000003
everybody in their lives gets deviated

3664.64 --> 3668.48
gets severely distracted by something

3666.72 --> 3670.64
pulled away

3668.48 --> 3671.92
because it's a part of the challenge if

3670.64 --> 3673.7599999999998
that never happens

3671.92 --> 3676.16
then you never know the difference so

3673.76 --> 3678.96
it's like a spiritual challenge that

3676.16 --> 3682.16
everybody at some point faces

3678.96 --> 3683.44
because they have to understand what it

3682.16 --> 3686.64
is

3683.44 --> 3689.28
in order to not be distracted

3686.64 --> 3699.5989999999997
and pulled away from themselves when it

3689.28 --> 3701.52
really matters in the future

3699.599 --> 3702.88
oh that voice in your head every human

3701.52 --> 3706.24
has

3702.88 --> 3706.96
well look it can be a virtual voice like

3706.24 --> 3710.16
a literal

3706.96 --> 3710.64
auditive thing you hear i don't like

3710.16 --> 3714.3999999999996
those

3710.64 --> 3717.839
it's too raw there's a step

3714.4 --> 3721.359
before that when there is no

3717.839 --> 3722.4
verbal things going on it's just spirit

3721.359 --> 3725.2799999999997
instant

3722.4 --> 3726.0
it's just the spirit the frequency the

3725.28 --> 3728.7200000000003
resonance

3726.0 --> 3731.68
the recognition and then you can attempt

3728.72 --> 3735.52
to translate that yourself

3731.68 --> 3736.3999999999996
into words to make people understand

3735.52 --> 3739.2
verbally

3736.4 --> 3740.1600000000003
that's what i constantly try to do but i

3739.2 --> 3743.5989999999997
don't listen

3740.16 --> 3745.839
i don't i really try to listen with my

3743.599 --> 3748.48
spirit directly and not

3745.839 --> 3749.7599999999998
i try to receive some auditory

3748.48 --> 3752.839
information

3749.76 --> 3755.28
through the step beyond that in the

3752.839 --> 3758.96
mechanism of my brain

3755.28 --> 3758.96
because that can be done

3761.039 --> 3765.119
there's i've met mediums that

3763.119 --> 3769.039
specifically do it like that

3765.119 --> 3770.079
they hear voices like literally hear

3769.039 --> 3772.1600000000003
them

3770.079 --> 3773.3590000000004
it always makes me very nervous because

3772.16 --> 3776.64
it's like is that

3773.359 --> 3779.119
is that really the safest way to do it

3776.64 --> 3781.0389999999998
i don't like to do that i just like to

3779.119 --> 3783.359
just

3781.039 --> 3785.2000000000003
do it with my spirit just just like that

3783.359 --> 3787.7599999999998
it's just like screw this body screw the

3785.2 --> 3790.72
sensors i have my spirit

3787.76 --> 3790.7200000000003
that's what i do it with

3795.68 --> 3801.7599999999998
the inner voice well brent m that

3798.72 --> 3803.68
is i know what you refer to

3801.76 --> 3805.92
the study about the inner voice well

3803.68 --> 3807.2799999999997
that is something different that is the

3805.92 --> 3810.079
inner monologue

3807.28 --> 3812.2400000000002
i think you mean it's not a literal

3810.079 --> 3813.8390000000004
voice it's the monologue it's like the

3812.24 --> 3818.319
inner conscious talking

3813.839 --> 3820.24
to yourself which is just thinking

3818.319 --> 3822.4
the inner monologue and it was revealed

3820.24 --> 3823.4399999999996
that not everybody these days has an

3822.4 --> 3827.039
inner monologue

3823.44 --> 3828.16
they just follow instructions from the

3827.039 --> 3829.76
outside

3828.16 --> 3833.2
is that what you were referring to it's

3829.76 --> 3833.2000000000003
not exactly the same thing

3836.4 --> 3840.559
not every person is human yo yeah

3838.559 --> 3853.8390000000004
provide some evidence for that thanks

3840.559 --> 3853.8390000000004
jared sanford that's really cute

3863.76 --> 3869.6800000000003
thoughts give you

3866.799 --> 3871.92
it's a little raw approach andrew but i

3869.68 --> 3873.5989999999997
think i know what you mean

3871.92 --> 3875.76
the information definitely comes from

3873.599 --> 3878.96
god if you

3875.76 --> 3883.3590000000004
if your spirit listens tries to catch

3878.96 --> 3885.92
an idea it comes from god it comes from

3883.359 --> 3885.92
creation

3887.68 --> 3891.7599999999998
it's debatable whether it is like

3889.92 --> 3895.359
literally god on the throne

3891.76 --> 3897.76
sending down a message to you or whether

3895.359 --> 3900.96
that whole thing was accounted for by

3897.76 --> 3906.3190000000004
creation itself and you merely receive

3900.96 --> 3906.319
the echoes of god through creation

3906.839 --> 3909.839
so

3913.81 --> 3916.92
[Music]

3922.24 --> 3927.5989999999997
brandm provided evidence that what what

3925.2 --> 3927.5989999999997
do you mean

3930.88 --> 3937.92
oh what are you talking about roger

3935.2 --> 3939.68
lockdown i heard something about this i

3937.92 --> 3942.48
couldn't find anything though

3939.68 --> 3951.839
what is how does this work i can still

3942.48 --> 3951.839
go to a store right

3956.799 --> 3959.92
so roger if you don't mind could you

3959.039 --> 3963.599
please

3959.92 --> 3967.44
like really concisely summarize the new

3963.599 --> 3967.44
changes that are apparently here

3971.839 --> 3975.359
because i already knew like the one

3973.76 --> 3979.8390000000004
december situation what

3975.359 --> 3979.839
what now

3980.16 --> 3985.68
what's this lockdown [ __ ] what does that

3983.44 --> 3985.68
mean

3990.24 --> 3998.4799999999996
everything is closed

3993.44 --> 3998.48
really like everything everything

4001.92 --> 4007.839
like coffee shops even

4016.0 --> 4023.28
you can pick up okay

4020.96 --> 4023.28
that

4025.92 --> 4029.839
we're in the netherlands here dark steve

4030.799 --> 4035.68
pick up well

4034.079 --> 4039.599
then i don't really know what the

4035.68 --> 4039.5989999999997
difference is rajay i really don't

4040.64 --> 4044.16
okay tara 306

4047.44 --> 4053.599
okay don't call me marwyn please

4054.88 --> 4058.559
yeah lockdowns are stupid i know

4060.4 --> 4064.7200000000003
like there's people here that are just

4062.96 --> 4069.28
really getting fed up with

4064.72 --> 4069.2799999999997
current politicians like really fed up

4071.76 --> 4075.5200000000004
so what i originally said even here on

4074.16 --> 4077.44
this show

4075.52 --> 4079.359
it might not be too far off what's

4077.44 --> 4081.119
eventually going to happen

4079.359 --> 4082.4
although i don't think there's literally

4081.119 --> 4086.7200000000003
going to be

4082.4 --> 4089.52
like heads on spiked fences and [ __ ]

4086.72 --> 4091.52
they're going to be in trouble they i

4089.52 --> 4092.96
yeah at this point i don't think they're

4091.52 --> 4105.839
going to escape

4092.96 --> 4105.839
jail time

4117.199 --> 4124.879999999999
right anyway yeah i'll check it out

4120.64 --> 4128.88
when i go for groceries i'm gonna just

4124.88 --> 4132.64
go and see what's open

4128.88 --> 4133.359
still but i don't know man i don't know

4132.64 --> 4136.64
if it

4133.359 --> 4139.279
like if even

4136.64 --> 4146.56
everybody will be complying i really

4139.279 --> 4148.799000000001
don't know

4146.56 --> 4150.400000000001
also or not thing yesterday for the

4148.799 --> 4152.719
first time

4150.4 --> 4153.5199999999995
in the organic supermarket somebody

4152.719 --> 4157.92
asked me there

4153.52 --> 4160.56
like like why are you not wearing a mask

4157.92 --> 4162.0
non-aggressively and then he said like

4160.56 --> 4165.6
are you a conscientious

4162.0 --> 4168.88
conscientious objector said absolutely

4165.6 --> 4168.88
and then stopped bothering me

4169.44 --> 4177.759
well i'm still very happy

4174.239 --> 4179.599999999999
but yeah i went to another supermarket i

4177.759 --> 4181.199
explained about this and they just would

4179.6 --> 4185.279
not allow me in

4181.199 --> 4189.5199999999995
if i didn't wear a mask so it's weird

4185.279 --> 4191.759
it's very odd so i wonder like how much

4189.52 --> 4193.040000000001
is everybody still just even gonna

4191.759 --> 4195.679
comply because

4193.04 --> 4197.44
seriously i this is very tough on dutch

4195.679 --> 4200.0
people because

4197.44 --> 4201.44
oh they all want to comply and be the

4200.0 --> 4204.08
first and

4201.44 --> 4205.839999999999
we can tolerate anything right yeah yeah

4204.08 --> 4206.239
well what if everybody would just say

4205.84 --> 4208.96
hey

4206.239 --> 4210.639999999999
government go [ __ ] yourself we're not

4208.96 --> 4212.88
gonna comply we're not gonna pay your

4210.64 --> 4215.4400000000005
stupid fines

4212.88 --> 4216.0
nobody is we're literally gonna ignore

4215.44 --> 4217.599999999999
everything

4216.0 --> 4219.28
you do what you're going to send the

4217.6 --> 4222.4800000000005
army after everybody

4219.28 --> 4224.239
for just having normal lives

4222.48 --> 4227.599999999999
is army really going to do that do they

4224.239 --> 4227.599999999999
even have enough people for that

4227.76 --> 4231.679
then i think that if literally nobody

4230.32 --> 4233.599999999999
would comply anymore

4231.679 --> 4235.84
there would be very little they could do

4233.6 --> 4238.2390000000005
about it they would just be made to look

4235.84 --> 4241.4400000000005
a complete ass

4238.239 --> 4243.44
which is what they are by the way

4241.44 --> 4244.96
it's just embarrassing that people are

4243.44 --> 4247.28
complying

4244.96 --> 4247.28
to me

4250.48 --> 4254.32
this idea of oh you get a fine or this

4253.12 --> 4258.88
or that

4254.32 --> 4260.08
really so what obligates you to pay that

4258.88 --> 4261.96
fine

4260.08 --> 4265.28
when it's obviously based on an

4261.96 --> 4265.28
unconstitutional thing

4265.44 --> 4267.919999999999
you see

4268.96 --> 4274.96
that's my idea behind it but yeah again

4272.48 --> 4275.599999999999
if you have a business don't try that

4274.96 --> 4278.88
without

4275.6 --> 4282.0
at least consulting a lawyer i don't

4278.88 --> 4284.719
know for sure but i just feel like

4282.0 --> 4285.6
that yeah that should be a potential

4284.719 --> 4288.719
option

4285.6 --> 4290.400000000001
somehow to literally just ignore it say

4288.719 --> 4292.2390000000005
like no

4290.4 --> 4293.839999999999
no yeah that's a really cute all these

4292.239 --> 4297.04
fines i'm just not going to pay it

4293.84 --> 4300.56
it's illegal i reject

4297.04 --> 4303.199
your fine

4300.56 --> 4304.96
but i don't know if that can actually

4303.199 --> 4314.32
work

4304.96 --> 4316.4800000000005
i have to consult a lawyer

4314.32 --> 4319.36
a small business have closed doors it's

4316.48 --> 4319.36
ripped sad

4326.84 --> 4330.88
sick

4328.719 --> 4332.2390000000005
i hope that all these small business

4330.88 --> 4335.52
owners get together

4332.239 --> 4338.718999999999
and actually start to form a front

4335.52 --> 4339.360000000001
against the government and figure out

4338.719 --> 4343.04
what to do

4339.36 --> 4344.0
about the situation before everybody but

4343.04 --> 4348.4
the big america

4344.0 --> 4350.64
mega corporations goes completely bust

4348.4 --> 4354.96
and you're gonna end up begging

4350.64 --> 4354.96
government for a bunch of shackles again

4355.04 --> 4361.84
right dutch people business owners or

4358.159 --> 4365.199
oh you're so great you're so dutch

4361.84 --> 4368.88
maybe yeah

4365.199 --> 4371.36
a little bit more proactive against

4368.88 --> 4373.04
the situation instead of just complying

4371.36 --> 4375.44
the [ __ ] out of everything and then

4373.04 --> 4377.44
complaining afterward on the internet

4375.44 --> 4379.759999999999
with your elaborate beautiful

4377.44 --> 4381.44
letters over how unjustified this is

4379.76 --> 4384.0
it's really cute

4381.44 --> 4386.48
where's the action where's the actual

4384.0 --> 4399.84
non-compliance

4386.48 --> 4399.839999999999
this is getting embarrassing

4424.84 --> 4430.719
right

4426.719 --> 4430.719
right yes random explorer it's true

4431.12 --> 4434.96
if the small business is run by a

4434.08 --> 4438.48
passionate

4434.96 --> 4441.28
caring person

4438.48 --> 4443.759999999999
that's really into doing it right it's

4441.28 --> 4447.599999999999
much more efficient and clean than any

4443.76 --> 4447.6
automated mega corporation

4447.679 --> 4451.04
which just leaves a lot of junk and a

4449.76 --> 4454.159000000001
lot of people that

4451.04 --> 4455.199
are like they're drowned their

4454.159 --> 4458.799999999999
personality just

4455.199 --> 4458.799999999999
drowns into the machine

4459.44 --> 4462.799999999999
and yeah that does not make them as

4461.679 --> 4465.1990000000005
passionate

4462.8 --> 4467.12
it's just constant burden they just have

4465.199 --> 4468.239
to lift this burden constantly like a

4467.12 --> 4471.12
mule and

4468.239 --> 4473.44
yeah that's really annoying it's really

4471.12 --> 4475.36
it's really sucky to work for a big mega

4473.44 --> 4478.48
corporation

4475.36 --> 4480.239
like that it sucks

4478.48 --> 4482.08
so you never get the same kind of

4480.239 --> 4497.839999999999
passion out of that as a small

4482.08 --> 4497.84
personal business owner

4498.32 --> 4511.84
wow brandon that's crazy

4516.96 --> 4523.12
yeah but random explorer this blatantly

4519.44 --> 4525.44
obvious they're never going to do that

4523.12 --> 4526.48
because that was the whole freaking

4525.44 --> 4529.44
point

4526.48 --> 4530.32
it's a mega corporation conspiracy power

4529.44 --> 4533.44
grab

4530.32 --> 4536.159
that's what the lockdowns are it's the

4533.44 --> 4537.759999999999
only thing they really are

4536.159 --> 4539.199
and if you would lock down the mega

4537.76 --> 4542.400000000001
corporations then

4539.199 --> 4543.5199999999995
everybody will absolutely go bust like

4542.4 --> 4546.4
everything will just

4543.52 --> 4546.400000000001
grind to a halt

4546.8 --> 4550.719
if they too got locked down that's why

4548.88 --> 4554.32
they're not and they know that

4550.719 --> 4557.28
they planned ahead for this [ __ ]

4554.32 --> 4558.4
so it's just processed like the

4557.28 --> 4560.719
essentials of

4558.4 --> 4563.199
how do we still keep things running and

4560.719 --> 4567.84
still lock down everything

4563.199 --> 4567.839999999999
and they played into that

4580.0 --> 4584.32
but yeah the real problem is is that

4582.0 --> 4585.92
people are allowing their governments to

4584.32 --> 4589.04
pull this [ __ ]

4585.92 --> 4591.1990000000005
it really is a problem like hello

4589.04 --> 4592.8
everybody millions of people in my

4591.199 --> 4595.04
country the government is

4592.8 --> 4596.8
literally just us economically

4595.04 --> 4599.76
assaulting the public

4596.8 --> 4602.08
for no good reason it really isn't a

4599.76 --> 4605.6
good reason by any standard by

4602.08 --> 4609.679
any standard guys it's just an

4605.6 --> 4612.8
economic assault with [ __ ]

4609.679 --> 4615.28
so why exactly are is

4612.8 --> 4618.56
anybody going along with this why are

4615.28 --> 4623.84
these people still in function

4618.56 --> 4623.84
i don't understand

4629.76 --> 4634.2390000000005
like there should be serious revolutions

4632.56 --> 4636.719
happening

4634.239 --> 4637.5199999999995
around the world where it's just like

4636.719 --> 4641.76
yeah go

4637.52 --> 4645.76
[ __ ] yourself and your scam medical [ __ ]

4641.76 --> 4646.08
and yeah in certain regions that would

4645.76 --> 4649.6
get

4646.08 --> 4651.76
damn well bloody there'd be yeah a lot

4649.6 --> 4653.76
of doctors that are gonna die

4651.76 --> 4654.8
because they push that [ __ ] and

4653.76 --> 4656.56
government

4654.8 --> 4658.08
or some countries when the government

4656.56 --> 4660.400000000001
pulls off something like that

4658.08 --> 4661.84
they are all get murdered right not

4660.4 --> 4662.96
saying that's gonna happen over here

4661.84 --> 4666.0
because we're dutch

4662.96 --> 4666.88
we're so civilized right it should be

4666.0 --> 4669.52
happening

4666.88 --> 4672.719
there should just be revolutions going

4669.52 --> 4672.719
on because of this [ __ ]

4673.44 --> 4676.48
so where is it

4676.96 --> 4681.44
is this the final age where literally no

4680.8 --> 4685.76
country

4681.44 --> 4688.5599999999995
in the world is not completely enslaved

4685.76 --> 4690.719
it's just like what is the flavor of

4688.56 --> 4694.56
enslavement you choose

4690.719 --> 4697.199
at this point you want this flavor of an

4694.56 --> 4698.96
enslavement or that flavor which flavor

4697.199 --> 4700.239
of enslavement do you want where's the

4698.96 --> 4701.84
real revolutions

4700.239 --> 4704.5599999999995
where's the people literally standing up

4701.84 --> 4706.96
saying this is absolute horseshit we are

4704.56 --> 4708.320000000001
being economically assaulted for no damn

4706.96 --> 4710.64
reason

4708.32 --> 4711.92
other than just a giant corporate power

4710.64 --> 4715.4400000000005
grab

4711.92 --> 4721.84
conspiring with politicians

4715.44 --> 4721.839999999999
and media when is this going to end

4724.92 --> 4728.079
[Music]

4742.4 --> 4747.04
yeah see you around and think about what

4744.8 --> 4748.96
i said dark steve

4747.04 --> 4751.84
gotta test your beliefs and if you don't

4748.96 --> 4755.28
have proper philosophical reasons

4751.84 --> 4758.159000000001
for yourself to maintain these beliefs

4755.28 --> 4760.08
it's just emotions then you may be

4758.159 --> 4763.04
having a very big problem

4760.08 --> 4766.159
a personal problem so think about it

4763.04 --> 4766.159
think about it carefully

4767.679 --> 4777.84
all right i'll see you next time

4781.57 --> 4784.7
[Music]

4788.84 --> 4791.84
right

4802.84 --> 4805.84
um

4830.8 --> 4833.84
all right

4833.92 --> 4836.32
anyway

4839.52 --> 4847.84
yeah be right back it shows got another

4842.4 --> 4847.839999999999
half hour to go

4942.84 --> 4945.84
you

4961.199 --> 4966.0
and look at that this quarters have

4963.6 --> 4970.56
found the stream again

4966.0 --> 4970.56
oh how they love to downvote it oh

4970.84 --> 4977.12
oh

4973.76 --> 4977.12
thanks for all the votes

4981.199 --> 4987.199
don't really care never do

4984.8 --> 4988.639
still doing the show every freaking day

4987.199 --> 4991.5199999999995
every day

4988.639 --> 4993.76
every day never gonna stop not even with

4991.52 --> 4994.56
a million down votes i don't care nobody

4993.76 --> 4997.76
really cares

4994.56 --> 4999.679
it's just a bunch of squirters

4997.76 --> 5002.56
trying to think they're smart by just

4999.679 --> 5004.719
screwing around with a lot of nonsense

5002.56 --> 5005.679
that's not going to last because

5004.719 --> 5009.04
afterward

5005.679 --> 5011.12
youtube always deletes it again

5009.04 --> 5014.8
so it's just a bunch of squirters with

5011.12 --> 5018.8
no life

5014.8 --> 5021.679
not bother to get a life no they just

5018.8 --> 5023.84
try to go for something that shines too

5021.679 --> 5026.159
bright in their faces

5023.84 --> 5027.92
hurts them so they have to then [ __ ]

5026.159 --> 5028.96
over it to try and cover up that light

5027.92 --> 5032.4800000000005
from reaching their

5028.96 --> 5034.8
faces right so then they waste all their

5032.48 --> 5038.879999999999
time it's all a giant giant

5034.8 --> 5040.400000000001
waste like this is like the most

5038.88 --> 5042.08
embarrassing thing you could do with

5040.4 --> 5045.92
your life is

5042.08 --> 5049.28
try to rig people's shows

5045.92 --> 5051.4400000000005
with votes troll accounts and like that

5049.28 --> 5053.679
actually matters anything like these

5051.44 --> 5057.919999999999
fake statistics

5053.679 --> 5061.679
are in some way valuable

5057.92 --> 5064.2390000000005
it's so dumb it's so unbelievably

5061.679 --> 5064.2390000000005
pathetic

5065.04 --> 5070.96
and i don't give a [ __ ]

5068.239 --> 5072.0
you know i could just turn off the votes

5070.96 --> 5073.76
entirely right

5072.0 --> 5077.04
a lot of flat earth channels do that

5073.76 --> 5080.4800000000005
they just turn it off

5077.04 --> 5084.159
i don't want to because i'd like to

5080.48 --> 5088.5599999999995
remind people how [ __ ]

5084.159 --> 5091.599999999999
pathetic some people are out there

5088.56 --> 5095.4400000000005
how unbelievably sad and

5091.6 --> 5095.4400000000005
miserable they must be

5096.639 --> 5099.84
yeah my personal recommendation is

5098.48 --> 5102.08
suicide

5099.84 --> 5104.56
just so you know people that actually

5102.08 --> 5107.84
engage in that [ __ ]

5104.56 --> 5110.080000000001
they really don't have anything useful

5107.84 --> 5111.6
left for them to do in this world they

5110.08 --> 5116.8
should just

5111.6 --> 5119.92
finish it because nobody gives a [ __ ]

5116.8 --> 5123.4400000000005
about you what you do

5119.92 --> 5125.12
or yeah nobody thinks you're a special

5123.44 --> 5127.04
boy because you do that sort of [ __ ]

5125.12 --> 5130.639
even anonymously and just

5127.04 --> 5132.8
try to [ __ ] around

5130.639 --> 5135.28
drop giant piles of anonymous [ __ ]

5132.8 --> 5138.56
everywhere nobody gives a [ __ ]

5135.28 --> 5138.5599999999995
buddy nobody

5139.76 --> 5144.96
it's just pathetic just pathetic that's

5142.8 --> 5144.96
it

5153.76 --> 5158.320000000001
oh and it makes youtube look bad

5156.8 --> 5160.719
just so you know it literally makes

5158.32 --> 5163.679
youtube look bad

5160.719 --> 5164.2390000000005
that's why it's so pathetic that youtube

5163.679 --> 5167.1990000000005
just

5164.239 --> 5169.839999999999
allows this [ __ ] to happen as well they

5167.199 --> 5171.44
just

5169.84 --> 5173.28
this sort of thing is happening

5171.44 --> 5176.5599999999995
constantly for

5173.28 --> 5178.8
for years and they just don't give a

5176.56 --> 5178.8
[ __ ]

5180.719 --> 5184.08
so yeah i often wondered like is youtube

5183.36 --> 5187.44
actually

5184.08 --> 5189.44
in the hands of a few people that have

5187.44 --> 5193.44
only one purpose for it

5189.44 --> 5195.36
they want to destroy youtube

5193.44 --> 5197.5199999999995
but they can't do it too overtly because

5195.36 --> 5200.88
then they will basically break contact

5197.52 --> 5203.92
contract so they just try to

5200.88 --> 5207.12
make people as miserable and dumb as

5203.92 --> 5210.159
they possibly can it's like the ultimate

5207.12 --> 5212.36
small hat influence could it be could it

5210.159 --> 5216.08
be its jews

5212.36 --> 5216.08
jews doing that

5216.32 --> 5223.759999999999
could it be or

5219.6 --> 5226.96
just really lost pathetic idiots

5223.76 --> 5229.84
either way you know jews kind of

5226.96 --> 5231.44
railroad this sort of activity and then

5229.84 --> 5234.56
other people follow suit

5231.44 --> 5238.08
like a bunch of sheep and they know this

5234.56 --> 5241.120000000001
so often jews

5238.08 --> 5243.04
have to do very very little

5241.12 --> 5244.84
very little they just set the example

5243.04 --> 5247.36
and then a whole culture of

5244.84 --> 5250.08
unbelievable [ __ ] retards just

5247.36 --> 5254.0
follows suit and starts to imitate them

5250.08 --> 5259.199
before you know it it's the standard

5254.0 --> 5259.199
isn't it is that what you're doing

5262.8 --> 5267.84
hey julia pavin

5274.88 --> 5278.84
right i just like to say that i just

5278.08 --> 5281.84
like to say

5278.84 --> 5281.84
jews

5282.0 --> 5285.199
i just like to say it

5289.12 --> 5293.04
like in reality it's nothing really that

5291.28 --> 5294.96
excited about it

5293.04 --> 5297.36
as i said they barely actually do

5294.96 --> 5298.08
anything they just got mind control over

5297.36 --> 5301.199
the sheep

5298.08 --> 5301.84
that's all and that's all is actually a

5301.199 --> 5305.5199999999995
huge

5301.84 --> 5308.719
influence but is what it is so you can't

5305.52 --> 5310.96
actually even pinpoint that much to

5308.719 --> 5314.56
individuals it's just that yeah they're

5310.96 --> 5314.56
the arbiters of that design

5316.159 --> 5322.5599999999995
that's it it's just people doing it to

5320.84 --> 5325.6
themselves

5322.56 --> 5326.2390000000005
just taking the bad examples like

5325.6 --> 5329.679
complete

5326.239 --> 5333.12
slave retards that deserve

5329.679 --> 5337.12
everything that's going to come to them

5333.12 --> 5339.5199999999995
everything every miserable thing you can

5337.12 --> 5342.159
imagine

5339.52 --> 5343.040000000001
as they slowly squirt themselves to

5342.159 --> 5351.839999999999
death

5343.04 --> 5351.84
over their lifetime sometimes quickly

5355.76 --> 5365.84
all right so it's a whole hobby now

5370.719 --> 5377.76
anyway can we continue a conversation

5373.84 --> 5379.84
perhaps somebody else is willing to ask

5377.76 --> 5393.84
got some good questions in these last

5379.84 --> 5393.84
20 minutes

5428.0 --> 5437.6
oh really ah

5434.8 --> 5438.719
yeah you mean you are a bunch of

5437.6 --> 5442.0
pathetic

5438.719 --> 5443.92
gamma [ __ ] squirter trolls that think

5442.0 --> 5447.04
your special boys

5443.92 --> 5450.08
and it is your life tasks

5447.04 --> 5451.679
to make everybody to try and make

5450.08 --> 5454.719
everybody look bad

5451.679 --> 5458.159
i know it's your life task it's really

5454.719 --> 5458.159
unbelievably pathetic

5458.48 --> 5461.839999999999
and i hope that when you realize what

5461.04 --> 5463.04
you've done

5461.84 --> 5466.56
[Music]

5463.04 --> 5468.32
you will pay the price

5466.56 --> 5470.0
it's not something that's anybody here

5468.32 --> 5470.639
in the world's gonna do no it's gonna

5470.0 --> 5473.199
come

5470.639 --> 5475.4400000000005
straight from the top i'm gonna pay the

5473.199 --> 5477.36
price oh god

5475.44 --> 5479.599999999999
it's the one thing i can truly gloat

5477.36 --> 5484.719
about because i know

5479.6 --> 5488.2390000000005
how unbelievably punishing that is

5484.719 --> 5489.12
once you end the cycle of absolute

5488.239 --> 5491.919999999999
demonic

5489.12 --> 5494.32
misery you're unleashing on the world

5491.92 --> 5494.32
yeah

5496.48 --> 5500.879999999999
banned people well you mean people that

5499.04 --> 5502.56
misbehave because they're a bunch of

5500.88 --> 5504.639
squirting pieces of [ __ ]

5502.56 --> 5505.84
that need to [ __ ] get out of this

5504.639 --> 5507.679
world and stop

5505.84 --> 5509.679
bothering other people with their

5507.679 --> 5512.639
[ __ ] and retardation

5509.679 --> 5513.52
yeah banned people should [ __ ] off

5512.639 --> 5515.92
that's right

5513.52 --> 5520.4800000000005
get a [ __ ] life you piece of [ __ ]

5515.92 --> 5520.4800000000005
[ __ ] off how about that

5521.28 --> 5528.239
yeah i know i know mr

5524.8 --> 5532.4800000000005
special boy with a special name

5528.239 --> 5535.44
yeah ever thought of maybe living

5532.48 --> 5537.919999999999
in an example actually following suit

5535.44 --> 5541.36
what christ was doing instead of just

5537.92 --> 5544.4
anonymously persecuting people on the

5541.36 --> 5547.04
internet that are just doing their thing

5544.4 --> 5547.599999999999
feeling like you're such a special boy

5547.04 --> 5549.76
right

5547.6 --> 5552.08
you think that's what christ you think

5549.76 --> 5554.320000000001
he's proud of that

5552.08 --> 5555.28
think he gives a [ __ ] about your

5554.32 --> 5558.08
delusional

5555.28 --> 5559.28
[ __ ] behavior at this point i don't

5558.08 --> 5562.4
think so

5559.28 --> 5564.08
i think you're just really unbelievably

5562.4 --> 5567.599999999999
delusional

5564.08 --> 5569.5199999999995
and lame and annoying as [ __ ]

5567.6 --> 5572.0
is there anybody in this world that will

5569.52 --> 5573.84
actually respect you

5572.0 --> 5575.6
they just can slave usually follow you

5573.84 --> 5578.0
like a bunch of goblins

5575.6 --> 5579.84
because if you go against you then ooh

5578.0 --> 5582.4
then it's just angry time and apparently

5579.84 --> 5584.8
some people are really afraid of that

5582.4 --> 5586.96
they were afraid of somebody being mean

5584.8 --> 5589.52
to them

5586.96 --> 5590.96
so they won't just stand up and say you

5589.52 --> 5595.280000000001
are a pathetic

5590.96 --> 5598.4
scumbag [ __ ] and i don't give a [ __ ]

5595.28 --> 5600.719
about what you do what you say your vote

5598.4 --> 5604.48
rigging mechanisms like a pathetic

5600.719 --> 5604.4800000000005
scam artist scoundrel

5605.52 --> 5610.320000000001
huh oh you don't care well then you can

5608.08 --> 5613.5199999999995
[ __ ] off your [ __ ]

5610.32 --> 5615.12
you piece of [ __ ] kill yourself [ __ ]

5613.52 --> 5618.8
scumbag

5615.12 --> 5622.32
fake christian devil

5618.8 --> 5625.52
in sheep's clothes scumbag

5622.32 --> 5631.84
yeah get a [ __ ] life

5625.52 --> 5631.84
or just end it

5633.0 --> 5636.18
[Music]

5637.04 --> 5642.84
japanese nah he is just a scumbag i

5640.239 --> 5645.839999999999
think it's probably

5642.84 --> 5645.84
jason

5645.92 --> 5659.84
some [ __ ] creep like that

5660.8 --> 5665.4400000000005
uh what do you think of those strings of

5663.36 --> 5666.48
light people have reported seeing in the

5665.44 --> 5668.239
sky following

5666.48 --> 5673.839999999999
space accident i don't really think

5668.239 --> 5673.839999999999
anything about it

5683.52 --> 5689.360000000001
i don't know maybe

5687.199 --> 5690.799999999999
maybe he's figured out the holographics

5689.36 --> 5693.28
of the sky and he's just

5690.8 --> 5695.119000000001
got permission to screw around with that

5693.28 --> 5696.48
i think that a lot of it is basically

5695.119 --> 5698.08
celestial hologram

5696.48 --> 5699.678999999999
yeah back engineered celestial

5698.08 --> 5702.5599999999995
holographics

5699.679 --> 5704.4800000000005
that's happening just figured out how to

5702.56 --> 5705.92
manipulate the lights

5704.48 --> 5707.919999999999
yeah and then i have no proof of that

5705.92 --> 5710.88
but i've suspected that for a while

5707.92 --> 5712.4
and i called it two years back or more

5710.88 --> 5713.6
where i basically said yeah at some

5712.4 --> 5715.638999999999
point

5713.6 --> 5716.8
there probably is going to be

5715.639 --> 5719.6
advertisement

5716.8 --> 5721.76
visible in the stars because it is

5719.6 --> 5723.76
artificially made that way

5721.76 --> 5724.8
things like that that's like a science

5723.76 --> 5729.280000000001
fiction i guess

5724.8 --> 5731.6
prediction that i've seen coming

5729.28 --> 5734.719
after i realized the holographic natures

5731.6 --> 5734.719
of the celestial light

5734.96 --> 5742.4800000000005
so maybe spacex and young musk is

5739.28 --> 5745.679
screwing around like that or maybe

5742.48 --> 5751.04
it's drones or balloons

5745.679 --> 5751.04
it's just that it's all very attention

5754.84 --> 5757.84
grabby

5764.48 --> 5771.839999999999
all right

5791.44 --> 5795.199
cover for the changing sky you have any

5793.6 --> 5798.08
evidence for that

5795.199 --> 5798.96
what changing skies how's the sky

5798.08 --> 5801.44
changing

5798.96 --> 5803.679
it's just the same there might be some

5801.44 --> 5806.879999999999
celestial special phenomena

5803.679 --> 5809.119
happening but that's not changing at the

5806.88 --> 5812.159000000001
sky it's just celestial

5809.119 --> 5813.679
phenomenon conjunction that sort of

5812.159 --> 5816.159
thing

5813.679 --> 5827.84
so i don't see a change in the skies

5816.159 --> 5827.839999999999
george sanford

5830.88 --> 5838.88
oh moved and changed right

5834.96 --> 5842.0
no i don't think so but hey

5838.88 --> 5843.679
celestial lights stars they do just

5842.0 --> 5845.679
disappear sometimes

5843.679 --> 5848.08
another one might pop up yeah that

5845.679 --> 5848.08
happens

5848.639 --> 5853.119
because it's just celestial light i

5850.719 --> 5854.8
don't know why that happens exactly

5853.119 --> 5856.32
because i do not know understand the

5854.8 --> 5860.08
full

5856.32 --> 5868.4
system of the nature as to

5860.08 --> 5872.0
how they appear the way they do

5868.4 --> 5875.119
what's yeah causing it to

5872.0 --> 5878.239
manifest in the specific pattern as it

5875.119 --> 5880.4
does i don't know that

5878.239 --> 5882.239
i have suspicions as to what feeds the

5880.4 --> 5883.92
energy that manifests them but that

5882.239 --> 5886.638999999999
doesn't mean i understand

5883.92 --> 5887.52
why that exact pattern formation every

5886.639 --> 5897.84
time

5887.52 --> 5897.84
why that i don't know i just don't

5898.0 --> 5903.84
but i've conceived of that it can be

5900.48 --> 5906.08
manipulated perhaps

5903.84 --> 5907.119000000001
that similar patterns could be

5906.08 --> 5911.84
manifested

5907.119 --> 5911.839999999999
through man-made technology

5912.08 --> 5917.119
like as if you were drawing in the in

5914.719 --> 5918.88
the celestial skies

5917.119 --> 5922.48
i've conceived that that may be a

5918.88 --> 5922.4800000000005
possibility technologically

5923.28 --> 5927.5199999999995
but that's about it that doesn't in the

5925.84 --> 5931.28
least explain as to

5927.52 --> 5934.2390000000005
why the celestial stars

5931.28 --> 5935.119
the lights why it specifically manifests

5934.239 --> 5937.04
in the way

5935.119 --> 5939.839999999999
and the pattern that it does i don't

5937.04 --> 5939.84
know why

5946.84 --> 5949.89
[Music]

5990.63 --> 5993.8
[Music]

6006.84 --> 6013.84
hmm right michael jones interesting

6011.119 --> 6015.44
i don't know i think that celestial

6013.84 --> 6018.639
reification

6015.44 --> 6022.159
storytelling is as ancient

6018.639 --> 6024.88
as the

6022.159 --> 6025.679
as the ones that came down and basically

6024.88 --> 6029.679
gave us

6025.679 --> 6033.1990000000005
all this knowledge explained in several

6029.679 --> 6035.6
different ways throughout religions

6033.199 --> 6036.799999999999
i think that yeah knowledge just brought

6035.6 --> 6040.159000000001
these options

6036.8 --> 6043.28
like as soon as that knowledge became

6040.159 --> 6043.599999999999
present some would get it others would

6043.28 --> 6045.28
not

6043.6 --> 6046.96
and then for the first time it was

6045.28 --> 6049.119
realized like yeah they don't get it we

6046.96 --> 6050.719
can basically tell them whatever we like

6049.119 --> 6052.88
and they'll probably believe it because

6050.719 --> 6054.32
we do get it and they don't

6052.88 --> 6056.719
and i think that's really when it

6054.32 --> 6056.719
started

6057.52 --> 6062.56
or as you could say when the first jew

6060.0 --> 6062.56
arrived

6063.28 --> 6081.329
it's just kidding but probably true

6078.22 --> 6081.329000000001
[Music]

6085.29 --> 6089.3
[Music]

6100.639 --> 6103.04
right

6103.76 --> 6107.679
but yeah any priesthood that is going to

6106.56 --> 6109.92
create any kind of

6107.679 --> 6112.4800000000005
story tradition with the reification of

6109.92 --> 6115.04
the celestial bodies

6112.48 --> 6117.5199999999995
it's always about just understanding it

6115.04 --> 6120.239
you know understanding what it really is

6117.52 --> 6120.8
or at least understanding what it really

6120.239 --> 6124.879999999999
isn't

6120.8 --> 6126.88
and then partaking in the story creation

6124.88 --> 6127.92
and manipulation of the minds of the

6126.88 --> 6135.84
believers

6127.92 --> 6135.84
that's what it's always been always

6142.639 --> 6147.36
many religions have personified the sun

6145.119 --> 6150.639
well yeah

6147.36 --> 6154.08
well there are arguments for that

6150.639 --> 6156.8
on a spiritual level you know isn't it

6154.08 --> 6160.5599999999995
even like colloquially described that

6156.8 --> 6163.4400000000005
a radiant person has like a huge amount

6160.56 --> 6166.8
of energy in them confidence strength

6163.44 --> 6170.719
that when they enter the room that

6166.8 --> 6170.719
it would be described as like

6170.96 --> 6174.56
yeah like their light hits you like a

6172.96 --> 6178.96
sun and that

6174.56 --> 6178.96
it's comparable to a really bright

6179.04 --> 6184.56
sun hitting your face

6182.48 --> 6185.759999999999
like that comparison has been made many

6184.56 --> 6188.080000000001
times so

6185.76 --> 6191.04
it's not strange that people would have

6188.08 --> 6195.44
tendency to basically start personifying

6191.04 --> 6198.56
the sun as if it were was a person

6195.44 --> 6201.199
because the spirit might

6198.56 --> 6202.400000000001
have the tendency to compare it like

6201.199 --> 6218.0
that because of

6202.4 --> 6221.199
the effects the experiences see

6218.0 --> 6224.08
like all personification and all

6221.199 --> 6226.4
reification

6224.08 --> 6227.119
always happens for a reason it happens

6226.4 --> 6230.638999999999
because of

6227.119 --> 6234.639
tendencies because of the human nature

6230.639 --> 6234.639
that's why it's predictable and even

6244.84 --> 6247.84
repeatable

6249.199 --> 6252.96
yeah so really cute with the down quotes

6251.44 --> 6255.839999999999
it's not gonna stay

6252.96 --> 6257.679
it never does so it's just a pathetic

6255.84 --> 6260.56
waste of time

6257.679 --> 6262.719
it's literally people wasting their time

6260.56 --> 6263.6
squirting over a bunch of numbers that

6262.719 --> 6266.0
are going to disappear

6263.6 --> 6267.04
anyway you might have noticed i really

6266.0 --> 6269.36
don't care

6267.04 --> 6272.0
i i literally don't you realize that

6269.36 --> 6274.239
this shit's been going down for

6272.0 --> 6276.08
three years straight on a daily basis

6274.239 --> 6279.119
why would you think that i'm now going

6276.08 --> 6279.119
to care at this point

6279.679 --> 6284.32
it's like i'm not it doesn't matter if

6282.8 --> 6287.4400000000005
anything this [ __ ]

6284.32 --> 6289.28
just emphasizes more that people are

6287.44 --> 6291.36
squirting over me

6289.28 --> 6293.92
and when people squirt over you it

6291.36 --> 6296.0
usually has something to do

6293.92 --> 6298.0
with that they're being triggered by

6296.0 --> 6300.84
something

6298.0 --> 6302.0
and that can either be terrible

6300.84 --> 6305.84
misbehavior

6302.0 --> 6308.08
that you could dissect or

6305.84 --> 6309.1990000000005
it could be that the person in question

6308.08 --> 6311.5199999999995
is actually

6309.199 --> 6313.119
confronting them with very painful

6311.52 --> 6316.719
personal truths

6313.119 --> 6320.48
because of what he does so yeah

6316.719 --> 6325.6
it only helps it literally only helps me

6320.48 --> 6325.599999999999
you get it you get it you pathetic idiot

6326.4 --> 6330.799999999999
you want to go against me you're only

6329.04 --> 6334.08
helping me and it's not a bluff it's

6330.8 --> 6337.6
literally provably so

6334.08 --> 6340.719
you're probably helping me with your

6337.6 --> 6340.719
pathetic actions

6341.36 --> 6347.92
but you're probably too headstrong too

6344.719 --> 6351.44
dumb to even give in to such

6347.92 --> 6354.56
realizations and just keep on going keep

6351.44 --> 6359.839999999999
on going because that's gonna work right

6354.56 --> 6359.84
yeah no

6365.52 --> 6369.92
right it's totally sad because it's

6368.56 --> 6371.76
yeah i don't even have that many

6369.92 --> 6372.56
watchers so it's technically even

6371.76 --> 6374.400000000001
impossible

6372.56 --> 6375.679
it's like who's going to believe this

6374.4 --> 6379.04
you're only proving

6375.679 --> 6379.52
you are rigging a system what does that

6379.04 --> 6381.76
mean

6379.52 --> 6384.080000000001
it means you're a pathetic quarter and

6381.76 --> 6388.2390000000005
the system is kind of broken

6384.08 --> 6390.96
that's it it doesn't do anything

6388.239 --> 6391.919999999999
it's not gonna stay youtube's just gonna

6390.96 --> 6394.4800000000005
remove it

6391.92 --> 6395.679
afterward so what are you really

6394.48 --> 6401.839999999999
accomplishing

6395.679 --> 6401.84
nothing just wasting time

6404.719 --> 6408.719
maybe they like helping you i doubt it

6412.48 --> 6417.919999999999
if they would actually like helping me

6414.4 --> 6417.92
they would probably do the opposite

6418.08 --> 6423.6
because i'm much more vulnerable to the

6420.8 --> 6428.96
idea of that i'm liked

6423.6 --> 6430.639
than that i am to being disliked

6428.96 --> 6432.96
because if people hate me i'm just going

6430.639 --> 6435.52
to be more careful

6432.96 --> 6436.2390000000005
they'll like me i might be more inclined

6435.52 --> 6438.96
to believe

6436.239 --> 6439.759999999999
yeah to like let go of my attention span

6438.96 --> 6442.8
a little

6439.76 --> 6444.320000000001
because i feel so safe and like right

6442.8 --> 6446.400000000001
but they don't care they're all too

6444.32 --> 6448.88
obsessed they they just

6446.4 --> 6451.04
want me out of the picture i'm like that

6448.88 --> 6453.28
thorn in their eye

6451.04 --> 6455.28
and it just won't go away and that's

6453.28 --> 6457.28
right i won't go away you're gonna have

6455.28 --> 6460.4
to [ __ ] literally kill me

6457.28 --> 6462.4
face to face and risk dying yourself

6460.4 --> 6464.159
because i will freaking kill you if you

6462.4 --> 6466.719
try that

6464.159 --> 6468.719
yeah that's the only way you can do it

6466.719 --> 6473.28
i'm not gonna go away

6468.719 --> 6473.28
ever you hear me ever

6473.76 --> 6476.780000000001
