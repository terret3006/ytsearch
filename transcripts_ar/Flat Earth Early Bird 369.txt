I usually don't see that on Sunday but

87.429 --> 98.47
other than that yeah it's kind of wind

89.229 --> 101.039
still the Sun is still nice very

98.47 --> 101.039
peaceful

108.789 --> 113.179
man I gotta stop making these night so

112.579 --> 118.729
late

113.179 --> 127.46000000000001
but yeah yesterday was Friday so I could

118.729 --> 130.369
drive along very late yeah not as nuts

127.46 --> 132.379
ladies yesterday no huh

130.369 --> 140.38
I got Tamara coffee with me today and

132.379 --> 143.72
tea that's it so let's see was in chat a

140.38 --> 152.019
GM was first secret Asian man drunken

143.72 --> 165.859
wallet for 1 1 + ZD 20.0 Missouri bear

152.019 --> 172.75
Amanda young Robin Stanley sure MC yeah

165.859 --> 178.79000000000002
good CEO so man I was watching a video

172.75 --> 181.91
see from globe Buster's day I think it

178.79 --> 183.2
uploaded it somewhere evening let me

181.91 --> 188.0
check the list

183.2 --> 190.48899999999998
yes 7 hours ago Oh what's must have been

188.0 --> 194.18
very early in the morning then very late

190.489 --> 199.489
I don't know anyway it was a very

194.18 --> 204.859
fascinating video about yeah comets

199.489 --> 208.04
Cataclysm this is apparently part 6b so

204.859 --> 211.91
it must be huge series but just going

208.04 --> 215.09
through all of it and I'm not like I'm

211.91 --> 218.989
not taking some kind of deep trust to it

215.09 --> 223.94
just as of yet but it does seem like

218.989 --> 227.59
there's just very wide broad view a lot

223.94 --> 231.67
of things taking into account account

227.59 --> 237.76
I don't get the feeling anything is

231.67 --> 240.39999999999998
really being excluded and it is just

237.76 --> 243.60999999999999
fascinating all about cyclical nature of

240.4 --> 248.37
the realm and even it's fascinating

243.61 --> 248.37
about the rising islands rising realms

251.19 --> 257.2
it's fascinating idea like what would

253.87 --> 266.169
happen if that would happen man would

257.2 --> 272.68
there be like a land race and then makes

266.169 --> 273.35999999999996
me think again you know land races think

272.68 --> 280.63
about it

273.36 --> 282.91
okay so during the colonization age when

280.63 --> 286.71999999999997
everything went around and there's we

282.91 --> 289.62
have our own views to that now of course

286.72 --> 293.14000000000004
with yeah the Jesuits going around and

289.62 --> 296.289
changing religions and all that and then

293.14 --> 299.08
of course the more mainstream view about

296.289 --> 305.05
yeah we just conquered other nations

299.08 --> 311.729
basically genocide bla that yeah sure in

305.05 --> 314.919
a way but then it seems like why then

311.729 --> 318.84999999999997
why would they all start doing that that

314.919 --> 322.289
like a race well if suddenly just a

318.85 --> 326.59000000000003
giant continent popped up somewhere and

322.289 --> 328.57
somebody figured out about it right or

326.59 --> 333.60999999999996
has some definite proof and it leaks

328.57 --> 336.43
yeah well that would be a good reason to

333.61 --> 340.24
basically start militarizing in order to

336.43 --> 343.45
occupy the land and then the corruption

340.24 --> 345.37
and the imperialism starts bubbling up

343.45 --> 349.03
and that is how that goes

345.37 --> 355.21
think about it maybe during that period

349.03 --> 358.51
somewhere well the the fabled land with

355.21 --> 359.46999999999997
the four rivers supposedly presumed to

358.51 --> 361.19
be at the North Pole

359.47 --> 365.27000000000004
maybe that popped

361.19 --> 367.79
for a while maybe that it was drawn it

365.27 --> 372.91999999999996
was may have been one of the reasons in

367.79 --> 376.22
order for it to go out and try to occupy

372.92 --> 379.64000000000004
land and then it might have been gone

376.22 --> 380.81
away again said just then stuck yeah

379.64 --> 387.05
they were already in an imperial

380.81 --> 393.29
situation and just taking over the

387.05 --> 395.90000000000003
America and everything else anyway it's

393.29 --> 398.5
a bit of a loose thought on my side but

395.9 --> 401.0
it just makes you think look it there's

398.5 --> 404.45
if it is just possible with that

401.0 --> 407.84
hey do to frequency changes hey that

404.45 --> 413.84
maybe lands pop up or that maybe parts

407.84 --> 420.73999999999995
of a realm closed off or open up in that

413.84 --> 423.38
fashion and and just this cyclical I did

420.74 --> 428.38
the idea of cycles and the changing of

423.38 --> 428.38
the land during during those specific

428.59 --> 436.96999999999997
change points yeah it I guess that

433.97 --> 438.77000000000004
concept inspired me fastly now I'm

436.97 --> 441.37
thinking about it a lot like what could

438.77 --> 441.37
happen and

445.93 --> 454.79
like how do they even rise up what they

450.97 --> 459.11
where do they come from our world like

454.79 --> 460.91
for example talk about the islands talk

459.11 --> 463.52000000000004
about the islands right that are

460.91 --> 465.8
supposedly arising or maybe previous

463.52 --> 468.83
islands or if they had like weird

465.8 --> 472.55
creatures where would they come from

468.83 --> 477.65
what they perhaps come from caves that

472.55 --> 480.44
are part of that island that that open

477.65 --> 484.64
up and those caves were maybe originally

480.44 --> 487.93
connected to the realms beneath I know

484.64 --> 491.33
it sounds very fantasy like but like

487.93 --> 496.79
that concept could literally spawn new

491.33 --> 498.8
types of creatures or yeah if one would

496.79 --> 500.81
think perceived further who knows it

498.8 --> 503.69
could maybe even create a permanent

500.81 --> 505.76
connection in some kind of new land area

503.69 --> 511.34
that pops up you could go in all

505.76 --> 514.66
directions but yeah I don't know heavy

511.34 --> 514.66
inspiration from that video

519.85 --> 525.269
[Music]

526.62 --> 532.71
yeah I also found it fascinating by the

529.23 --> 535.77
way that that there was a lot of like

532.71 --> 537.87
spiritual parallel ideas being drawn

535.77 --> 541.13
from it now that is not that of course

537.87 --> 543.2
it's like that's you could say that that

541.13 --> 546.9
pseudoscience of approach

543.2 --> 549.09
it's like speculative derivatives it's

546.9 --> 552.0
reading signs it is in a way divination

549.09 --> 555.72
of the material but i-i've always said

552.0 --> 560.06
about the biblical story for example is

555.72 --> 563.76
that yeah there's a way that you need to

560.06 --> 568.56
understand it but that doesn't exclude

563.76 --> 571.77
it from being able to have the other

568.56 --> 577.0799999999999
effects as well including metaphorical

571.77 --> 581.97
and spiritual parallels I think I think

577.08 --> 590.63
at all stacks I think the Bible is just

581.97 --> 590.63
an incredible book anyway

591.08 --> 594.249
[Music]

595.07 --> 601.5400000000001
so are you guys and gals up to

622.949 --> 629.459
the idea that anybody thinks they can

626.79 --> 632.7199999999999
know when these things happen prior to

629.459 --> 632.7199999999999
any written account

637.91 --> 640.7199999999999
really

641.64 --> 645.23
why would you say that

692.41 --> 699.28
now good to hear misery bear but anyway

696.58 --> 708.22
yeah flat plane Oregon I kind of asked

699.28 --> 711.37
you a question I mean there there is

708.22 --> 717.73
just a huge preponderance of cross

711.37 --> 721.99
references and yeah it seems like they

717.73 --> 725.86
just put everything together and the

721.99 --> 729.7
thing about lies is that the more you

725.86 --> 737.65
see the more they start to light up and

729.7 --> 740.59
start to break down what they do so if

737.65 --> 744.5699999999999
you're gonna be like okay everything

740.59 --> 747.5500000000001
that that says that what I currently

744.57 --> 751.3000000000001
specifically believe for whatever reason

747.55 --> 754.0899999999999
is is that it must all be lies because

751.3 --> 758.02
it doesn't comply to the specific type

754.09 --> 762.94
of idea that I have right now about what

758.02 --> 765.75
is true then then you're mistaken the

762.94 --> 765.75
method is wrong

768.14 --> 775.88
in my opinion really I think that's it's

771.62 --> 780.43
not effective you got to figure out what

775.88 --> 783.86
the lies are nothing is 100% lies or

780.43 --> 786.26
only lies like if for example if some

783.86 --> 789.2
person is a pathological liar yeah

786.26 --> 793.459
that's really bad but that is so

789.2 --> 795.62
apparent you gotta go suspend your

793.459 --> 801.8
disbelief in order to not to see it

795.62 --> 804.29
eventually but any story yeah any story

801.8 --> 807.019
anywhere may for some reason contain

804.29 --> 810.4699999999999
lies whether it be the secret from a

807.019 --> 813.62
writer or a rewriter a caretaker

810.47 --> 815.72
sneakily or just the person telling it

813.62 --> 818.12
wrong because they have a slightly

815.72 --> 819.97
different opinion yeah that happens a

818.12 --> 823.01
lot actually

819.97 --> 827.69
well yeah some groups more than others

823.01 --> 831.23
so you got to figure out what the lies

827.69 --> 838.3100000000001
are and not just say okay this seems to

831.23 --> 842.0600000000001
disagree in some detail and some

838.31 --> 845.149
philosophical detail then yeah I got a

842.06 --> 850.8199999999999
it I just negated say it's all bad I

845.149 --> 852.38
don't think that's right anyway I don't

850.82 --> 856.149
know if that is what you were aiming for

852.38 --> 856.149
that's why I asked

859.5 --> 867.45
all right okay okay sorry I sometimes

864.57 --> 871.0200000000001
just take things too complicated you

867.45 --> 872.82
were probably just mentioning the what

871.02 --> 876.48
is it carbon dating there's issues with

872.82 --> 879.8000000000001
carbon dating they're severely off it's

876.48 --> 883.14
like the astronomical effect and of

879.8 --> 885.5999999999999
course dating by rock layers which is

883.14 --> 887.97
ridiculous because things can petrify

885.6 --> 890.45
very rapidly and the ways things are

887.97 --> 893.46
found found in rock layers and all that

890.45 --> 895.9100000000001
like upside down trees that makes no

893.46 --> 898.6500000000001
damn sense unless there was a flood

895.91 --> 903.4499999999999
situation some kind and flooding

898.65 --> 906.17
typically could cause rapid

903.45 --> 909.84
petrification and wouldn't take

906.17 --> 911.3399999999999
extremely long things would net

909.84 --> 914.25
especially if there was some shaking

911.34 --> 916.5300000000001
around while it still was fluid the mud

914.25 --> 918.69
and all that then things would even

916.53 --> 921.0
start to order themselves through

918.69 --> 924.9300000000001
relative density within the fluid medium

921.0 --> 928.13
yeah and then once it solidifies it

924.93 --> 931.0799999999999
stays stuck to that and then hey the

928.13 --> 933.9
archaeologists draw specific conclusions

931.08 --> 935.94
from that that must be in this age this

933.9 --> 942.7099999999999
happened in that day that's complete

935.94 --> 942.71
nonsense I totally agree to that

946.99 --> 952.4300000000001
yeah

948.26 --> 957.25
relative density so funny isn't it so

952.43 --> 957.25
funny how it works every single time

963.38 --> 966.58
[Music]

997.12 --> 1002.829
[Music]

999.699 --> 1007.7189999999999
how do they know the direction what's

1002.829 --> 1010.2289999999999
preset just is it's not an intelligent

1007.719 --> 1010.229
action

1019.24 --> 1028.71
it's very simple then sir

1022.9 --> 1028.71
goes down less-dense goes up

1034.16 --> 1038.029
[Music]

1038.53 --> 1042.51
low recognize Stephanie listen

1054.0 --> 1061.94
great but anyway I still step back to

1059.669 --> 1064.8600000000001
that video I was talking about earlier I

1061.94 --> 1068.22
thought I'm almost through it

1064.86 --> 1071.1
I still have Wow okay yeah I'm kind of

1068.22 --> 1076.549
through it just one minute left so I've

1071.1 --> 1080.01
pretty much seen the entire thing but

1076.549 --> 1083.6399999999999
yeah they mentioned the eventually it

1080.01 --> 1087.14
kind of an angle to it was that like it

1083.64 --> 1089.789
is important I thought it was very

1087.14 --> 1092.3400000000001
fascinating very very fascinating it was

1089.789 --> 1094.19
so much weight to that like serious I

1092.34 --> 1099.09
don't know if ever anyone could see that

1094.19 --> 1105.21
but the concept that if you know your

1099.09 --> 1108.809
history then like the wisdom of all of

1105.21 --> 1112.2
it reflects upon society and upon the

1108.809 --> 1114.78
lore but if history is erased and

1112.2 --> 1118.8500000000001
replaced with nonsense then everybody

1114.78 --> 1123.6
starts to grow insane and you get a

1118.85 --> 1129.26
Sodom and Gomorrah situation and it's

1123.6 --> 1132.23
just yes that is just true and in a way

1129.26 --> 1135.6589999999999
it made me realize as well that

1132.23 --> 1138.83
technically I yeah I like to think that

1135.659 --> 1141.75
I'm kind of wise for my age and

1138.83 --> 1148.9499999999998
hopefully smart probably not as smart as

1141.75 --> 1150.99
I hope I am well yeah you know what a

1148.95 --> 1160.23
smart smart usually comes from the

1150.99 --> 1163.32
result and whatever anyway it just made

1160.23 --> 1165.3600000000001
me realize like okay basically I really

1163.32 --> 1170.82
don't know for sure a lot of these

1165.36 --> 1176.1299999999999
things and that does give me also ya

1170.82 --> 1182.75
status of still being like a child in

1176.13 --> 1182.75
face of true knowledge really added

1196.45 --> 1205.04
and yeah most of us are that's not with

1201.92 --> 1209.3600000000001
a lot is just very apparent but like

1205.04 --> 1213.7
even the very smart ones that the wise

1209.36 --> 1213.6999999999998
is that most knowledgeable of people I

1214.51 --> 1221.36
wonder how much they really know or if

1218.9 --> 1228.2
they just know more about what is

1221.36 --> 1231.53
fabricated and maybe they even have an

1228.2 --> 1232.28
understanding as to how they could get

1231.53 --> 1234.77
it back

1232.28 --> 1237.98
I wonder even sometimes if it's like

1234.77 --> 1241.36
okay are the apps of the deepest

1237.98 --> 1246.46
controllers that are so remote to us

1241.36 --> 1250.52
never even heard of them are they like

1246.46 --> 1254.57
being blackmailed over true knowledge

1250.52 --> 1256.76
not even personal but just like okay we

1254.57 --> 1262.85
have the true knowledge we can restore

1256.76 --> 1267.07
the world but if we do it then they

1262.85 --> 1270.28
attack or something that kind of idea I

1267.07 --> 1270.28
wonder sometimes

1280.28 --> 1288.5
I I have no idea Ragnar Steffen Alderson

1284.09 --> 1293.54
but look as we go and as we continue it

1288.5 --> 1298.72
is absolutely inevitable that concerning

1293.54 --> 1301.55
every angle to what we stand for

1298.72 --> 1306.05
everything will probably at some point

1301.55 --> 1310.04
be taken up by by people that aren't

1306.05 --> 1313.22
lost then they just go crazy over it

1310.04 --> 1318.11
like become separate fanatics about it

1313.22 --> 1319.6100000000001
and and go just full [ __ ] and it's

1318.11 --> 1323.7199999999998
probably gonna happen with almost

1319.61 --> 1324.9299999999998
everything it's just people are still

1323.72 --> 1330.079
lost

1324.93 --> 1330.079
[Music]

1334.13 --> 1339.2
I don't know about young earth

1335.87 --> 1340.7299999999998
creationists really I don't know a lot

1339.2 --> 1343.94
about it

1340.73 --> 1343.94
[Music]

1366.59 --> 1370.72
I had a meeting good morning

1378.9 --> 1386.669
okay why doesn't sleeping warrior tell

1383.559 --> 1386.6689999999999
me himself then

1392.01 --> 1396.609
[Music]

1396.78 --> 1403.81
eh-eh what's now I just kicked myself

1402.31 --> 1405.28
out your hangout and then tried to get

1403.81 --> 1406.69
back in it boy to watch a load of

1405.28 --> 1411.34
adverts that I just couldn't evolved

1406.69 --> 1413.0800000000002
this sorry em I was having a

1411.34 --> 1415.6
conversation last night with them a ball

1413.08 --> 1416.8899999999999
earth believer in a facebook chat and he

1415.6 --> 1418.7199999999998
said to me and this is quite a

1416.89 --> 1420.76
reasonable challenge he said to me I

1418.72 --> 1422.29
tell you why he says I'll give you that

1420.76 --> 1424.45
you need a gas content you need a

1422.29 --> 1427.12
container to have a gas pressure he said

1424.45 --> 1429.25
if you can explain to me how the gas

1427.12 --> 1430.4499999999998
pressure at sea levels created so I

1429.25 --> 1432.16
started talking to him about the

1430.45 --> 1433.96
hydrological cycle and all the other

1432.16 --> 1436.6000000000001
cycles that go into the world and the

1433.96 --> 1438.7
creation of gas pressure at the ground

1436.6 --> 1441.37
level and one of the things I come

1438.7 --> 1443.38
across is we can explain where the

1441.37 --> 1444.76
oxygen that we breathe comes from we can

1443.38 --> 1446.74
explain where the helium and the

1444.76 --> 1448.9
hydrogen and a few other bits and pieces

1446.74 --> 1450.7
comes from but I want the one big one

1448.9 --> 1452.89
with it that I didn't get an answer to

1450.7 --> 1455.2
was where the nitrogen comes from no

1452.89 --> 1457.69
nitrogen is like 75% of the air the

1455.2 --> 1459.25
atmosphere that we breathe and like 25

1457.69 --> 1460.96
30 percent of its oxygen and then

1459.25 --> 1462.52
there's a bit of other trace gases that

1460.96 --> 1465.4
we also breathe but most of it is

1462.52 --> 1468.1
nitrogen if you try looking where does

1465.4 --> 1470.8600000000001
the nitrogen come from the a nitrogen

1468.1 --> 1473.8
cycle is the answer but it comes from

1470.86 --> 1476.32
bacteria and the bacteria that it comes

1473.8 --> 1478.23
from doesn't explain the the amount of

1476.32 --> 1482.26
nitrogen that's in what we breathe the

1478.23 --> 1484.39
75% of what we breathe so if the if the

1482.26 --> 1486.01
hydrological cycle creates the oxygen

1484.39 --> 1487.3300000000002
and that explains the 30 percent of the

1486.01 --> 1489.1
oxygen because it comes from the

1487.33 --> 1491.1699999999998
evaporation of water off the oceans and

1489.1 --> 1493.06
then the precipitation and rainfall that

1491.17 --> 1494.74
falls on the land that makes sense

1493.06 --> 1496.35
because you can account for where the

1494.74 --> 1498.93
oxygen gets generated at ground level

1496.35 --> 1502.27
but when you look into the hydrogen

1498.93 --> 1504.1000000000001
bacteria the nice created the hydrogen

1502.27 --> 1507.52
isn't creating anywhere near the very

1504.1 --> 1509.32
nice necessary nitrogen right sorry

1507.52 --> 1512.32
nitrogen yeah I get them too mixed up

1509.32 --> 1514.87
all the time this is bacteria that's

1512.32 --> 1516.76
creating nitrogen doesn't give us the

1514.87 --> 1518.86
volume of nitrogen that we actually have

1516.76 --> 1520.3
real world so the question is well we

1518.86 --> 1522.5089999999998
can explain where some of it comes from

1520.3 --> 1525.029
but why is the atmosphere got 75

1522.509 --> 1526.619
and nitrogen we breathe the other bits

1525.029 --> 1527.94
and pieces that's fine we can explain

1526.619 --> 1530.099
that but where did the nitrogen come

1527.94 --> 1531.69
from how is it created and there is no

1530.099 --> 1533.399
answer they don't know what they could

1531.69 --> 1535.769
they believe they claim it came from

1533.399 --> 1537.7189999999998
volcanic activity or from asteroids or

1535.769 --> 1539.729
whatever but there is no explanation in

1537.719 --> 1542.6090000000002
science so what's a really interesting

1539.729 --> 1544.409
topic is try and look at the creation of

1542.609 --> 1547.049
nitrogen where did it actually come from

1544.409 --> 1549.269
and there is no answer oh hold on hold

1547.049 --> 1551.9089999999999
on you said it's being created by

1549.269 --> 1553.019
bacteria right yeah but that doesn't

1551.909 --> 1554.0700000000002
account for the volume of noise yeah

1553.019 --> 1557.069
that doesn't matter

1554.07 --> 1560.129
so explain me more about those bacteria

1557.069 --> 1562.199
what where what what do they create do

1560.129 --> 1565.4089999999999
they create it in the soil do they

1562.199 --> 1567.269
create a gas what do they do yes it's

1565.409 --> 1570.209
the bacteria that's decomposing like

1567.269 --> 1571.619
matter so soil basically the bacteria

1570.209 --> 1573.269
that's in soil is supposed to be

1571.619 --> 1575.1899999999998
responsible for power of the nitrogen

1573.269 --> 1577.259
cycle but it doesn't create the volume

1575.19 --> 1582.509
that we see in the atmosphere does it

1577.259 --> 1585.719
create nitrogen gas or solid well it

1582.509 --> 1587.94
does it writes and nitrates and and I'm

1585.719 --> 1590.699
right it's about it's about so it's not

1587.94 --> 1592.769
a gas no it does create the gas it

1590.699 --> 1595.019
doesn't create the gas it's the only

1592.769 --> 1597.179
input of gas nitrogen gas back into the

1595.019 --> 1599.609
atmosphere but it doesn't account for

1597.179 --> 1601.739
the volume it accounts for maybe keeping

1599.609 --> 1603.9289999999999
the volume there but it doesn't account

1601.739 --> 1606.3890000000001
for this so I mean the amount of

1603.929 --> 1608.459
bacteria in soil that's creating

1606.389 --> 1610.829
nitrogen you could account for maybe

1608.459 --> 1613.319
five maybe eight percent of the

1610.829 --> 1614.399
atmosphere but if it's 75 percent of the

1613.319 --> 1616.529
atmosphere there's got to be something

1614.399 --> 1618.389
that's got a bigger effect than the

1616.529 --> 1619.979
hydrological cycle which is warming up

1618.389 --> 1621.6899999999998
the waters of the oceans and the lakes

1619.979 --> 1623.94
and the reservoirs and that and the

1621.69 --> 1625.529
rivers that's evaporated all that water

1623.94 --> 1628.199
to give us the hydrogen and the oxygen

1625.529 --> 1630.269
that I can understand but if that

1628.199 --> 1632.279
represents just 30% then what's the

1630.269 --> 1634.259
creation device for the other suddenly

1632.279 --> 1636.089
percent that's there's the nitrogen and

1634.259 --> 1638.069
if the answer that they give us is

1636.089 --> 1640.139
bacteria that's not giving us the volume

1638.069 --> 1645.529
to explain why we've got seventy four

1640.139 --> 1649.4089999999999
seventy percent maybe there's other ways

1645.529 --> 1652.859
that nature recycles the nitrogen gas

1649.409 --> 1655.1390000000001
that we're not aware of a couple of

1652.859 --> 1656.22
people on our side to ask them was there

1655.139 --> 1657.9289999999999
any other ways that

1656.22 --> 1660.929
you might be created in the atmosphere

1657.929 --> 1662.549
and the answer is no and what what is

1660.929 --> 1664.409
taught to kids is as far as they can

1662.549 --> 1665.76
tell where it comes from and I said but

1664.409 --> 1668.7
there's a massive scale issue here

1665.76 --> 1670.5
there's like um nitrogen but it's not

1668.7 --> 1671.82
being created by a source that gives us

1670.5 --> 1673.59
an abundance of nitrogen and mean

1671.82 --> 1675.21
bacteria in soil is gonna give us a

1673.59 --> 1677.07
little bit but it's definitely not gonna

1675.21 --> 1678.33
give us 70 percent of the atmosphere and

1677.07 --> 1679.83
he said this is one of the paradoxes

1678.33 --> 1681.6299999999999
with the model he said where did the

1679.83 --> 1683.25
nitrogen come from I said well what's

1681.63 --> 1686.22
the answer and he says they don't know

1683.25 --> 1689.28
well how about just a very long buildup

1686.22 --> 1691.83
of time and then eventually and who

1689.28 --> 1693.75
knows maybe when it was much less the

1691.83 --> 1697.4089999999999
growth would be more rapid for some

1693.75 --> 1702.87
reason okay just I'm just saying

1697.409 --> 1705.39
and it would build up over a long time

1702.87 --> 1708.1789999999999
and as long as there's yeah nothing

1705.39 --> 1710.0300000000002
really taking it back absorbing it it

1708.179 --> 1712.74
will just keep on growing and growing

1710.03 --> 1714.48
while at the same time it could be that

1712.74 --> 1716.429
there is some process out there that

1714.48 --> 1720.48
requires it creates a co mass of

1716.429 --> 1724.02
nitrogen to be of 70% in order for it

1720.48 --> 1727.28
whatever it is Rock a plant something to

1724.02 --> 1730.1399999999999
assimilate it into solid form

1727.28 --> 1732.0
we don't know it's all speculative

1730.14 --> 1735.45
conjecture and nobody really has an

1732.0 --> 1737.25
explanation or a click or thinking well

1735.45 --> 1739.44
it's not even a cycle there's just no

1737.25 --> 1741.69
everything else that we understand now

1739.44 --> 1745.559
about nature and even chemistry is

1741.69 --> 1748.6200000000001
cyclical so it's very likely there is a

1745.559 --> 1751.71
cyclical nature to it or it would be a

1748.62 --> 1753.1789999999999
design out of whack think about it the

1751.71 --> 1754.98
cyclical nature is explained with

1753.179 --> 1756.72
bacteria in soil which doesn't give us

1754.98 --> 1758.7
the volume but anyway I rank a couple of

1756.72 --> 1760.65
people to see what was I missing

1758.7 --> 1762.27
somewhere and then one person I rank

1760.65 --> 1764.64
I'll not say who doesn't matter who you

1762.27 --> 1765.45
just said that's that's one of two big

1764.64 --> 1767.5490000000002
key questions

1765.45 --> 1768.659
I saw what's the other question he says

1767.549 --> 1769.9189999999999
well if you're questioning where the

1768.659 --> 1771.7800000000002
nitrogen in the atmosphere come from

1769.919 --> 1775.0800000000002
where did the water of the oceans come

1771.78 --> 1776.94
from I don't know we'll try and try and

1775.08 --> 1778.02
find out the answer so then I spent half

1776.94 --> 1780.24
an hour trying to find out where the

1778.02 --> 1782.07
waters of the oceans come from and there

1780.24 --> 1783.51
is no answer it's either just been here

1782.07 --> 1785.7
or it has to have been put there by

1783.51 --> 1787.649
something otherwise known as a creator

1785.7 --> 1789.419
and obviously science is never going to

1787.649 --> 1791.789
accept that a creator might done it

1789.419 --> 1793.469
but I'm gonna ask people well where does

1791.789 --> 1794.94
the nitrogen in the air come from where

1793.469 --> 1796.6490000000001
does the oceans at what the waters of

1794.94 --> 1798.8990000000001
the oceans come from because these

1796.649 --> 1800.4589999999998
things are our reality and we expect

1798.899 --> 1802.049
science with all the money and all the

1800.459 --> 1803.19
technology and all the people they

1802.049 --> 1804.809
should have the answers for all this

1803.19 --> 1806.729
stuff where did the waters of the world

1804.809 --> 1808.109
come from did they come from God or did

1806.729 --> 1811.469
it come from somewhere else and how can

1808.109 --> 1815.519
you prove it I don't know even in the

1811.469 --> 1818.279
biblical story you know the waters were

1815.519 --> 1819.989
already there God simply related they

1818.279 --> 1823.859
split the waters from the waters

1819.989 --> 1826.169
and then I don't know he did actually

1823.859 --> 1831.299
create the land I guess or he made it

1826.169 --> 1835.44
rise not 100% clear on that and then

1831.299 --> 1837.089
proceeded to design life that's mostly

1835.44 --> 1840.419
it but the waters were already there

1837.089 --> 1842.009
very blatantly so well no he opened the

1840.419 --> 1844.1090000000002
vaults of heaven and the water felt the

1842.009 --> 1844.619
the oceans fell through didn't he that's

1844.109 --> 1848.6689999999999
later

1844.619 --> 1850.1689999999999
Oh in any event on the on the creation

1848.669 --> 1853.2
after realm that's what I'm talking

1850.169 --> 1854.5790000000002
about in any event there's got to be

1853.2 --> 1856.079
explanation on the heliocentric

1854.579 --> 1857.839
narrative for where the oceans come from

1856.079 --> 1862.469
because that's a whole lot of water

1857.839 --> 1863.759
that's come on I just found it

1862.469 --> 1865.8590000000002
astonishing that I haven't even

1863.759 --> 1867.629
considered the possibility that the

1865.859 --> 1869.789
waters of the oceans and the the

1867.629 --> 1871.619
nitrogen content in the air were not

1869.789 --> 1873.419
actually clearly explained on the model

1871.619 --> 1875.549
it's like well I'm on we have got these

1873.419 --> 1877.5890000000002
in real world where they come from Wow

1875.549 --> 1878.759
over where the gravity is a force or not

1877.589 --> 1880.499
what we've not really considered the

1878.759 --> 1884.3890000000001
bigger picture God you made me do it

1880.499 --> 1887.219
again started ridiculous comparison with

1884.389 --> 1889.559
heliocentric model but yeah originally I

1887.219 --> 1892.259
was kind of made to believe or maybe I

1889.559 --> 1895.859
made myself to believe this that the

1892.259 --> 1900.059
oceans were originally created from the

1895.859 --> 1904.259
hydrogen of the Sun turning to water and

1900.059 --> 1906.95
then being sprayed around and then most

1904.259 --> 1909.24
of it ended up on earth or something

1906.95 --> 1911.7
that's

1909.24 --> 1914.52
yeah that doesn't make a lot of sense I

1911.7 --> 1918.96
know that's what I used to think about

1914.52 --> 1920.22
it from a heliocentric perspective I've

1918.96 --> 1922.47
been having a back and forth that Danny

1920.22 --> 1927.059
Falconer huh no I found about lurking in

1922.47 --> 1928.679
a private group sorry on Facebook and

1927.059 --> 1930.36
he's in a private audience right so it's

1928.679 --> 1932.19
like limited to just fly if there's an

1930.36 --> 1934.049
ball earthers and there's no like normal

1932.19 --> 1936.8700000000001
normies in there that's for the like a

1934.049 --> 1938.27
questionnaire to get in there and do you

1936.87 --> 1940.6789999999999
remember when we in the night in like

1938.27 --> 1942.21
2016 we were arguing over where the mass

1940.679 --> 1944.46
attracted mass and we had the Cavendish

1942.21 --> 1946.6490000000001
experiments at least it gave us some

1944.46 --> 1948.059
experiment just to give us something to

1946.649 --> 1949.9189999999999
support the assertion that mass

1948.059 --> 1953.97
attracted maths you mean a machination

1949.919 --> 1955.3500000000001
yeah so it's manly however good or bad

1953.97 --> 1956.73
it was isn't really the point the point

1955.35 --> 1958.049
is that they gave us something right and

1956.73 --> 1959.88
then we could have an argument over what

1958.049 --> 1960.33
did it prove or whether it was science

1959.88 --> 1963.96
or whatever

1960.33 --> 1967.289
now since 2016 it's moved on right at

1963.96 --> 1970.83
some point in 2017 maybe 18 Einstein

1967.289 --> 1972.539
demonstrated or Einstein or suppose the

1970.83 --> 1974.1299999999999
effect of the curves of space-time and

1972.539 --> 1975.299
now we're currently all over that and

1974.13 --> 1976.919
we're saying well if gravity is not a

1975.299 --> 1978.779
force then what's causing this not a

1976.919 --> 1980.3700000000001
kneeler and the whole model falls apart

1978.779 --> 1982.44
but everybody still wants it to be a

1980.37 --> 1984.6299999999999
force and they still apply as a force it

1982.44 --> 1987.059
Han steins to current science well I've

1984.63 --> 1988.5
not got Danny Danny Falconer and I've

1987.059 --> 1990.299
got him pinned up against the wall and

1988.5 --> 1991.83
I'm pummeling him right and he's what's

1990.299 --> 1995.1589999999999
actually happening is he's getting

1991.83 --> 1996.6299999999999
bolder that like defenders doing his

1995.159 --> 1998.25
battling for him so that he doesn't

1996.63 --> 1999.5390000000002
really have to do anything and I keep

1998.25 --> 2000.919
saying look let me deal with Danny

1999.539 --> 2004.039
because Danny claims he's never come

2000.919 --> 2005.8990000000001
across on an argument that he couldn't

2004.039 --> 2007.46
refute and I'm saying that you can't

2005.899 --> 2009.4089999999999
have gas pressure gradients in a vacuum

2007.46 --> 2011.27
without some kind of container container

2009.409 --> 2012.919
is the demonstration that proves that

2011.27 --> 2014.87
you can't do it I wanted to demonstrate

2012.919 --> 2016.3990000000001
or provide evidence to support the

2014.87 --> 2017.9599999999998
assertion that he can and he keeps

2016.399 --> 2019.1
saying well just walk outside and I

2017.96 --> 2021.47
might not sound affirming the consequent

2019.1 --> 2023.4189999999999
I want a scientific demonstration that

2021.47 --> 2025.13
allows you to do this anyway he hasn't

2023.419 --> 2026.8090000000002
got it so now I'm getting an attack for

2025.13 --> 2028.8200000000002
why I'm challenging him and I'm saying

2026.809 --> 2030.86
but listen Danny Faulkner is challenging

2028.82 --> 2033.32
an attacking Eric Dubay all the time

2030.86 --> 2035.51
Eric debates Nadia to challenge him or

2033.32 --> 2038.09
defend himself I said so what and nobody

2035.51 --> 2040.25
says a word but now I'm here and I want

2038.09 --> 2043.28
one question answering and he hasn't

2040.25 --> 2045.47
answer or refuses to one and everyone's

2043.28 --> 2047.03
attacking me yeah all I'm asking for is

2045.47 --> 2049.34
the evidence I'm not making any claims

2047.03 --> 2051.379
I'm just saying that ministry this is

2049.34 --> 2053.36
true and I'm being attacked I'm being

2051.379 --> 2055.1
challenged and not Danny Danny's the one

2053.36 --> 2057.98
with the claim I'm just asking for proof

2055.1 --> 2059.6
read all the psychology of the group are

2057.98 --> 2061.1
all defending him slightly stand in

2059.6 --> 2062.6
front of him like shields like human

2061.1 --> 2064.1
shields so that he doesn't have to

2062.6 --> 2065.54
defend himself and I'm like listen I

2064.1 --> 2067.58
want to see the evidence please can you

2065.54 --> 2069.5299999999997
provide it or not now at least one we

2067.58 --> 2071.0299999999997
have Einstein give you now the bending

2069.53 --> 2073.159
space-time concept at least we've got

2071.03 --> 2074.57
bowling balls on bed sheets right well I

2073.159 --> 2077.03
want to see some experiment that

2074.57 --> 2078.679
quantifies or at least gives credibility

2077.03 --> 2080.1200000000003
there's a possibility that we might be

2078.679 --> 2082.639
able to have gas pressure gradients in

2080.12 --> 2084.35
in a vacuum with our container and I get

2082.639 --> 2085.81
me nothing so I want to see the

2084.35 --> 2088.159
bedsheets are we and what do you think

2085.81 --> 2091.27
well I don't want to see the bedsheets

2088.159 --> 2094.159
but yeah you're doing the right thing

2091.27 --> 2096.5
look even on my hangouts sometimes when

2094.159 --> 2099.29
I get into specific flat earth subjects

2096.5 --> 2101.6
or claims from the ballers and demand

2099.29 --> 2102.41
proof and all that yeah it's the same

2101.6 --> 2106.2799999999997
thing every time

2102.41 --> 2109.7599999999998
and then there's ballers that are just

2106.28 --> 2112.9100000000003
half the goal also to get all in our

2109.76 --> 2116.42
face and be like ha why don't you

2112.91 --> 2119.1099999999997
provide the evidence for our claim hmm

2116.42 --> 2121.85
if you think it's all not true that [ __ ]

2119.11 --> 2126.59
that's yeah they've been doing that with

2121.85 --> 2130.04
me every time so after I just addressed

2126.59 --> 2131.7200000000003
a claim of theirs I've got a guy let's

2130.04 --> 2133.37
go into this chart and he says hey flat

2131.72 --> 2135.4399999999996
earthers how do you explain this problem

2133.37 --> 2138.0499999999997
and therefore the problems quantified in

2135.44 --> 2140.35
a picture message it says the effective

2138.05 --> 2143.1200000000003
acceleration of gravity at the poles is

2140.35 --> 2145.46
980 centimeters per second per second

2143.12 --> 2147.38
well at the equator is just three point

2145.46 --> 2150.07
three nine centimeters per second per

2147.38 --> 2152.06
second oh it is three point three nine

2150.07 --> 2154.9100000000003
centimeters per second per second less

2152.06 --> 2156.83
due to the centrifugal force if you

2154.91 --> 2159.17
weighed 100 pounds at the North Pole on

2156.83 --> 2160.85
a spring scale at the equator you were

2159.17 --> 2163.9300000000003
only way ninety nine point six five

2160.85 --> 2167.48
pounds or five point five ounces less

2163.93 --> 2169.5499999999997
Isis Garces terraces can we see the

2167.48 --> 2171.31
evidence to prove the claim rather than

2169.55 --> 2173.63
just accept that the claim might be true

2171.31 --> 2176.029
specifically the fall rates at the north

2173.63 --> 2178.369
Paul and his response was well yeah you

2176.029 --> 2179.869
just need a precision balance so I says

2178.369 --> 2181.279
well so you don't actually have the

2179.869 --> 2183.0190000000002
evidence to present we have to go to the

2181.279 --> 2184.73
North Pole to measure ourselves do you

2183.019 --> 2187.549
see any problems with your evidence here

2184.73 --> 2189.23
right and and also if they really wanted

2187.549 --> 2192.799
to seriously prove that they would have

2189.23 --> 2195.109
to have a controlled room with pressure

2192.799 --> 2197.9
and temperature control to be perfectly

2195.109 --> 2200.15
equal otherwise there could yeah they're

2197.9 --> 2202.73
not isolating their independent variable

2200.15 --> 2205.4
properly I think the whole groups love

2202.73 --> 2207.259
in the application of the affirming the

2205.4 --> 2209.2400000000002
consequent narrative like if we're on a

2207.259 --> 2209.63
pole then the Sun will rise in the

2209.24 --> 2211.4599999999996
morning

2209.63 --> 2215.059
the Sun rises in the morning we must be

2211.46 --> 2217.46
on a ball oh my god yeah sticks in the

2215.059 --> 2218.48
ground it's quite nice actually because

2217.46 --> 2220.16
we're kind of it's kind of like going

2218.48 --> 2222.47
back into a time warp in the sense that

2220.16 --> 2223.7889999999998
on Nathan's debate now no one's allowed

2222.47 --> 2226.069
to beg the question anymore right he

2223.789 --> 2227.63
doesn't allow it so going into this room

2226.069 --> 2229.7889999999998
where it is seen it does seem to be

2227.63 --> 2231.109
encouraged and supported going into this

2229.789 --> 2233.7200000000003
room it's kind of like going back into

2231.109 --> 2235.0389999999998
Nathan's debate show from maybe 18

2233.72 --> 2244.1899999999996
months or when we were learning how to

2235.039 --> 2247.2200000000003
behave Mikey da o ru Sagan now you're

2244.19 --> 2248.66
talking about my hangout here no no I'm

2247.22 --> 2250.819
saying in this in this particular

2248.66 --> 2252.68
Facebook group oh right right the

2250.819 --> 2254.269
Facebook group sorry yeah it's like

2252.68 --> 2255.41
going back in time to where in the early

2254.269 --> 2257.8689999999997
days of Nathan's when they used to come

2255.41 --> 2259.64
in and say silly things like if I hop on

2257.869 --> 2262.069
my like for 30 seconds it means we must

2259.64 --> 2263.93
be on a ball I can hover my leg for 30

2262.069 --> 2265.759
seconds therefore it must be a ball it's

2263.93 --> 2268.279
like no but they're all doing it

2265.759 --> 2270.559
including Danny Faulkner he said I was

2268.279 --> 2272.029
Danny Falk and I said how is it that you

2270.559 --> 2274.3390000000004
can navigate on a flat plane

2272.029 --> 2275.63
um and I'm like what the same way that

2274.339 --> 2277.46
you do or not on a ball you use a

2275.63 --> 2278.839
sextant they work on both models because

2277.46 --> 2280.88
the difference between the two models is

2278.839 --> 2282.89
that negligible the human error covers

2280.88 --> 2283.309
it and he's like that's not answering my

2282.89 --> 2285.6189999999997
question

2283.309 --> 2287.3590000000004
and I'm like yes the answers your

2285.619 --> 2289.5190000000002
question is not what I want to see you

2287.359 --> 2291.3489999999997
never get on a flat plane I said oh my

2289.519 --> 2293.029
god Danny listen to what I've just said

2291.349 --> 2294.71
it works on both models because the

2293.029 --> 2298.039
human error and it covers both models

2294.71 --> 2299.48
--is the difference is too small I don't

2298.039 --> 2301.5190000000002
know I think what it is because it's a

2299.48 --> 2303.38
private group I think he's gone in there

2301.519 --> 2305.24
with the mindset of I'm gonna keep this

2303.38 --> 2307.1600000000003
a closed circuit so that I can preach my

2305.24 --> 2309.62
nonsense and the nav managed to get me

2307.16 --> 2311.7799999999997
in the slide like firing bullets against

2309.62 --> 2313.46
him and now the like [ __ ] we can't kick

2311.78 --> 2314.78
him out because he's not swore okay I

2313.46 --> 2316.9700000000003
kick him out because he's not overly

2314.78 --> 2318.59
personal he is on point he is asking a

2316.97 --> 2320.4199999999996
pertinent question he's asking for

2318.59 --> 2321.29
evidence and we don't know what to do

2320.42 --> 2322.79
with this guy

2321.29 --> 2325.43
so Danny's getting his head kicked in

2322.79 --> 2328.73
and he doesn't realize it yet right yeah

2325.43 --> 2331.64
and maybe Danny is a guy that picked up

2328.73 --> 2334.1
above upon a little about begging the

2331.64 --> 2336.7599999999998
question but instead of taking it as a

2334.1 --> 2341.23
warning he thought hey I can use this

2336.76 --> 2344.9900000000002
let's bag the code the the question in

2341.23 --> 2348.65
every detail where else can I beg the

2344.99 --> 2351.0699999999997
question maybe that is maybe it's just

2348.65 --> 2354.14
loving being a ball or too much

2351.07 --> 2355.31
well the honestly this it's interesting

2354.14 --> 2357.17
what I'm gonna do I'm not gonna go

2355.31 --> 2358.7599999999998
public with the group just yet because I

2357.17 --> 2360.35
want to I'm gonna put my feelers out to

2358.76 --> 2361.88
see what you can and can't get away with

2360.35 --> 2363.7999999999997
and see whether it's suitable for us to

2361.88 --> 2365.81
flood it because if it's suitable for us

2363.8 --> 2367.25
to flood it on our side we should all go

2365.81 --> 2369.08
in there flood it and just batter them

2367.25 --> 2370.49
all because it's full of these people

2369.08 --> 2372.7999999999997
like that stand in front of other people

2370.49 --> 2375.89
and make like human shields to protect

2372.8 --> 2377.15
the blobbies in there and I'm like you

2375.89 --> 2379.0699999999997
know I'm just one guy here but there's

2377.15 --> 2380.39
definitely some kind of weird military

2379.07 --> 2381.77
operation going on and they are all

2380.39 --> 2383.75
protecting each other and holding each

2381.77 --> 2385.49
other's Willie's kind of thing I'll just

2383.75 --> 2386.81
wait couple more days see how it is and

2385.49 --> 2389.7799999999997
then if it's as good as what I think it

2386.81 --> 2391.25
is I'll advertise it publicly I'll get

2389.78 --> 2392.57
all the fighters to go in there and

2391.25 --> 2393.83
we'll just go in there and run riots

2392.57 --> 2395.42
against all these balls that are begging

2393.83 --> 2398.68
the question it's great we'll go in

2395.42 --> 2400.33
there apply Nathan stuff and killable

2398.68 --> 2409.18
[Music]

2400.33 --> 2409.18
all right what's new are we new well

2409.81 --> 2415.36
good video from globe Buster's yesterday

2412.64 --> 2418.1299999999997
or this morning I guess really early

2415.36 --> 2420.32
would have been at 7 o'clock or

2418.13 --> 2422.65
something did you see it it wasn't

2420.32 --> 2422.65
upload

2426.37 --> 2439.6099999999997
what about comets Cataclysm it's a part

2432.92 --> 2442.54
six be uploaded seven hours it didn't

2439.61 --> 2445.3700000000003
you see that it well it's very

2442.54 --> 2448.7
alternative history and astrological

2445.37 --> 2453.38
even and about cyclical nature after

2448.7 --> 2457.0099999999998
it's fascinating very fascinating I I'm

2453.38 --> 2465.32
still thinking about it and other than

2457.01 --> 2468.5200000000004
that would be everything seems to be

2465.32 --> 2474.53
going fine now why I got through the

2468.52 --> 2476.72
financial dip of the last month and yeah

2474.53 --> 2482.63
doing great

2476.72 --> 2485.8599999999997
hoping to get a a what is it a arm form

2482.63 --> 2488.4500000000003
a microphone so I don't get this

2485.86 --> 2489.1400000000003
nonsense all the time which happens way

2488.45 --> 2491.7799999999997
too much

2489.14 --> 2498.83
I noticed afterwards I don't hear it as

2491.78 --> 2501.65
badly as you in YouTube so oh yeah and

2498.83 --> 2503.81
the and my what is it battery charge I

2501.65 --> 2506.63
need to get that thing in same time

2503.81 --> 2510.7599999999998
reading the Bible and I started at the

2506.63 --> 2515.92
Jesus part which is much more satisfying

2510.76 --> 2521.36
and I don't know yeah everything's just

2515.92 --> 2523.76
going as it does keeping tabs on roughly

2521.36 --> 2531.79
everything keeping up to date with

2523.76 --> 2531.7900000000004
sci-fi and movies as well right

2533.9 --> 2541.309
as for flat earth yeah I'm kind of like

2537.28 --> 2543.5890000000004
I've put down like very detailed options

2541.309 --> 2546.349
that could turn out to be true

2543.589 --> 2548.39
considering the looping model concept

2546.349 --> 2550.9900000000002
how for example equator could not be a

2548.39 --> 2553.7
perfect straight line but just a a

2550.99 --> 2556.339
curved line that kind of very confusing

2553.7 --> 2560.89
situation and beyond that there's really

2556.339 --> 2564.5299999999997
nothing new except for well maybe

2560.89 --> 2567.319
opening loops to other realms laterally

2564.53 --> 2569.119
not yeah in the in the movie of on globe

2567.319 --> 2570.829
busters they suggested that literally

2569.119 --> 2574.13
islands would come up out of the ocean

2570.829 --> 2577.069
that's super fascinating but yeah I've

2574.13 --> 2579.589
considered also that's simply spaces to

2577.069 --> 2583.64
other other more realm

2579.589 --> 2586.64
could also open up like a loop study

2583.64 --> 2588.29
being an yeah open up where before you

2586.64 --> 2591.109
would go there and you would literally

2588.29 --> 2593.99
come back where you came from because it

2591.109 --> 2595.94
seemed seemingly connecting or it is

2593.99 --> 2600.2299999999996
literally connecting and then suddenly

2595.94 --> 2602.2400000000002
that spatial loop opens up and then how

2600.23 --> 2605.299
everything interconnects just changes

2602.24 --> 2609.049
and it centrally connects to something

2605.299 --> 2612.079
else more space out there that might

2609.049 --> 2614.42
exist even to this day and is simply cut

2612.079 --> 2619.3390000000004
off from their vantage point in the same

2614.42 --> 2621.65
manner to our realm are we can I read um

2619.339 --> 2623.119
you know when I said this he has human

2621.65 --> 2625.7000000000003
shields that stands in front of him

2623.119 --> 2627.859
let me read you a comment back from one

2625.7 --> 2630.02
of his he might not be imposed by him

2627.859 --> 2631.79
but she's acting as a human shield her

2630.02 --> 2633.98
name is Diane and she says you really

2631.79 --> 2635.569
don't get out Daffy do sound do you can

2633.98 --> 2637.309
I ask what study you've done into any

2635.569 --> 2638.96
realm physics because it seems to me

2637.309 --> 2641.059
that you skipped over it at school level

2638.96 --> 2643.4
your questions are your questions have

2641.059 --> 2644.599
been answered over and over I directed a

2643.4 --> 2646.579
question at you because you threw that

2644.599 --> 2648.6800000000003
gauntlet to me about the Sun sighs have

2646.579 --> 2650.9
you given me your wisdom yet on that and

2648.68 --> 2652.549
I said Diane Allen answering questions

2650.9 --> 2654.4700000000003
is not what I'm asking for I've said

2652.549 --> 2656.15
repeatedly that I'm asked I'm asking for

2654.47 --> 2658.7
the experiment or the demonstration of

2656.15 --> 2660.38
gas pressure without a container not

2658.7 --> 2661.79
explanation do you understand the

2660.38 --> 2663.55
difference and then I said about

2661.79 --> 2665.5
condition balls on things

2663.55 --> 2667.03
and I'm just saying come we have all

2665.5 --> 2669.01
this she's come back to me and she said

2667.03 --> 2670.63
so if I asked you for an experiment to

2669.01 --> 2672.4900000000002
show how planes fly you could find one

2670.63 --> 2674.56
could you will get an explanation about

2672.49 --> 2676.7799999999997
aerodynamics and lift be adequate for

2674.56 --> 2678.22
you and I said yet its application of

2676.78 --> 2680.53
the Bernoulli effect would you like a

2678.22 --> 2681.73
video and then I won't get a video and I

2680.53 --> 2683.44
say there's a demonstration of the

2681.73 --> 2689.4900000000002
Bernoulli effect now I also want that

2683.44 --> 2691.96
gas pressure in a vacuum test nice yeah

2689.49 --> 2693.8199999999997
waiting to see what she says yeah you're

2691.96 --> 2696.7
doing this back and forth type - right I

2693.82 --> 2698.8300000000004
take it yeah in a Facebook group would

2696.7 --> 2702.22
be very difficult to put that out for

2698.83 --> 2703.99
ably like that that perfect yeah well

2702.22 --> 2704.9199999999996
done all right listen now and I'm gonna

2703.99 --> 2705.9399999999996
have to drop because it's gonna get

2704.92 --> 2707.35
noisy near now because there's a

2705.94 --> 2713.29
Christmas tree going out believe it or

2707.35 --> 2714.2799999999997
not well not even in December mmm listen

2713.29 --> 2715.5099999999998
I'm gonna have to go me I'll speak to

2714.28 --> 2717.67
you later cause it's gonna get noise

2715.51 --> 2720.5800000000004
yeah that's alright hey thanks for for

2717.67 --> 2723.42
coming on oh he's good Xena Bay right

2720.58 --> 2723.42
alright see you later

2724.58 --> 2733.19
[Music]

2737.56 --> 2747.54
I don't like like killing them you know

2742.83 --> 2751.12
for me I don't know why but just get a

2747.54 --> 2755.62
small tree that's actually in dirt in a

2751.12 --> 2758.56
big pot and then wheel it in and then

2755.62 --> 2760.15
after you're done wheel it out that

2758.56 --> 2763.2999999999997
would be a much better way to go don't

2760.15 --> 2767.88
kill it don't kill it for nothing for

2763.3 --> 2771.34
your for your holiday ritual you know

2767.88 --> 2773.4700000000003
anyway yeah but that's for every

2771.34 --> 2775.54
individual to decide and I don't have a

2773.47 --> 2778.12
lot of space here for a Christmas tree

2775.54 --> 2781.5
if you know what I mean even if I could

2778.12 --> 2781.5
if I want to do

2784.32 --> 2793.88
oh my god Brenda are you blabbering on

2791.31 --> 2793.88
about now

2803.58 --> 2814.17
[Music]

2810.82 --> 2817.8590000000004
you didn't even spell it right Brenda

2814.17 --> 2817.859
just ridiculous

2827.04 --> 2837.25
hilarious you think that that is a that

2832.75 --> 2840.91
is gas pressure without a container okay

2837.25 --> 2846.3
guys I got to show you this just like

2840.91 --> 2851.22
that I see something here in a corner

2846.3 --> 2856.5600000000004
wait let me show this more properly ooh

2851.22 --> 2856.56
that's great

2861.78 --> 2866.6600000000003
come on that's better

2868.9 --> 2876.2200000000003
yeah look see that Oh for the right that

2872.89 --> 2878.7889999999998
picture that is apparently well that is

2876.22 --> 2881.259
what it shows

2878.789 --> 2885.94
apparently this effect taking place so

2881.259 --> 2887.89
it's going to be their part yeah this is

2885.94 --> 2890.38
what it's supposed to approve the effect

2887.89 --> 2894.1299999999997
so I'm not even reading it at this point

2890.38 --> 2897.94
as to what it's supposed to be but what

2894.13 --> 2907.1800000000003
I see here is pretty conclusively a

2897.94 --> 2913.39
container and Brenda let me just let me

2907.18 --> 2917.3089999999997
emphasize that I see that I think that's

2913.39 --> 2917.3089999999997
a container Brenda

2921.62 --> 2928.23
[Music]

2923.61 --> 2928.23
I'm just just saying

2929.02 --> 2932.23
[Music]

2936.19 --> 2947.98
oh yeah in that thingy there was both

2943.789 --> 2951.44
gases and fluids as far as I could see

2947.98 --> 2953.9
yeah I didn't even look into what the

2951.44 --> 2956.18
effect supposed to be at just the

2953.9 --> 2959.39
outright claim that that's supposed to

2956.18 --> 2961.819
show pressure without a container while

2959.39 --> 2966.74
it literally being in a container it's

2961.819 --> 2969.369
just there it is Brenda it is brand

2966.74 --> 2969.3689999999997
after all

2983.21 --> 2989.66
yeah but Brenda it's in a container so

2987.16 --> 2994.25
you know whatever's going on there is

2989.66 --> 2997.91
very fascinating but it is in a

2994.25 --> 2999.68
container yes it is that glass thing are

2997.91 --> 3004.71
you saying that's not a container are

2999.68 --> 3007.24
you saying that that is just in the open

3004.71 --> 3015.9
I'm pretty sure that was a container

3007.24 --> 3019.8689999999997
Brenda do I need to show you again yeah

3015.9 --> 3020.53
that that kind of looks like a container

3019.869 --> 3025.4500000000003
to me

3020.53 --> 3028.8
let me just yeah

3025.45 --> 3028.7999999999997
pretty sure that's a container

3032.33 --> 3037.12
mm yeah container

3038.41 --> 3041.91
looks like it's contained

3049.4 --> 3052.65
[Music]

3063.77 --> 3070.319
ragnar Stefan hey listen I don't think

3066.99 --> 3073.2299999999996
the earth needs a dome to have gas

3070.319 --> 3081.839
pressure it just needs a limited amount

3073.23 --> 3084.0
of space and enough gas pressure to fill

3081.839 --> 3087.95
it in order for whatever we're

3084.0 --> 3092.069
experiencing here to manifest like that

3087.95 --> 3095.6699999999996
so either there is a huge amount of

3092.069 --> 3099.349
space above us and then it's all filled

3095.67 --> 3102.63
with certain degrees of gas pressure and

3099.349 --> 3104.46
then for some reason all the gradient

3102.63 --> 3106.799
here that would still be a mystery to me

3104.46 --> 3109.289
as to why the gradient would shaped like

3106.799 --> 3110.66
that it's not the logic of gradients but

3109.289 --> 3115.289
who knows

3110.66 --> 3117.8289999999997
but it can't be unlimited that doesn't

3115.289 --> 3117.829
make any sense

3126.61 --> 3133.63
so I am basically assuming there is at

3129.64 --> 3137.16
some point a flattop that is what I'm

3133.63 --> 3137.1600000000003
assuming at the moment

3146.46 --> 3155.609
what

3149.089 --> 3158.249
no no sorry to Cosentino as I said this

3155.609 --> 3164.8489999999997
space above us cannot be infinite it

3158.249 --> 3168.269
could be super vast beyond what we size

3164.849 --> 3172.319
it up it's never going to be as big as

3168.269 --> 3180.9889999999996
what the astronomers think it is but it

3172.319 --> 3183.269
cannot be unlimited that's illogical so

3180.989 --> 3193.829
it has to end somewhere it's a yeah I'm

3183.269 --> 3197.5789999999997
going for a flat top agree with are you

3193.829 --> 3199.619
serious Ragnar Steffen Alderson look

3197.579 --> 3203.969
there is no vacuum of space up there

3199.619 --> 3208.079
that can never be it's no design that

3203.969 --> 3213.2690000000002
will allow that in any fashion unless

3208.079 --> 3215.3390000000004
there is a literal separation you know

3213.269 --> 3217.709
and you can go all science fictiony

3215.339 --> 3219.959
about it I already did that I'm just

3217.709 --> 3221.64
wondering that even just indulging in

3219.959 --> 3223.3799999999997
presuppositional science fiction

3221.64 --> 3227.009
thinking at this point and finding

3223.38 --> 3230.719
clever solutions is just going to create

3227.009 --> 3233.64
more madness for many people that just

3230.719 --> 3237.2690000000002
are like desperately taking it as

3233.64 --> 3239.8089999999997
literal and that's never my that was

3237.269 --> 3245.1189999999997
never my intention in the first place

3239.809 --> 3249.0190000000002
because to me the model really is a game

3245.119 --> 3249.0190000000002
it really is to me

3254.76 --> 3261.75
right explain the atmospheric reading

3258.63 --> 3264.3900000000003
the fresher right well gradients yeah

3261.75 --> 3267.119
atmospheric well the atmosphere is gas

3264.39 --> 3270.45
right that's what we've been able to

3267.119 --> 3274.56
measure so far literally conformably

3270.45 --> 3278.1
measure right so there is a gradient to

3274.56 --> 3280.74
it and funnily enough when you size down

3278.1 --> 3281.0699999999997
a container size and you fill it up with

3280.74 --> 3284.1
gas

3281.07 --> 3287.46
there's also slight gradients forming

3284.1 --> 3290.16
and the smaller the container the more

3287.46 --> 3292.71
minut the gradient becomes so the size

3290.16 --> 3296.81
of the container matters for how much of

3292.71 --> 3300.7200000000003
a gradient will manifest within it and

3296.81 --> 3304.47
there you got a hint cuz you can test

3300.72 --> 3306.33
this not saying that I personally have

3304.47 --> 3308.73
but I'm pretty damn sure this is gonna

3306.33 --> 3311.13
work out and that is just get different

3308.73 --> 3313.67
sized containers and then test them all

3311.13 --> 3317.76
out with different types of pressure

3313.67 --> 3320.4900000000002
test what the exact pressure gradients

3317.76 --> 3322.92
in every location of those containers

3320.49 --> 3325.109
become and every different pressure

3322.92 --> 3327.27
situation and you'll learn the perfect

3325.109 --> 3329.79
nature of the gradient and how it

3327.27 --> 3331.92
manifests how it will always manifest in

3329.79 --> 3336.24
relation to container size and pressure

3331.92 --> 3341.04
and I'm pretty damn sure that it's going

3336.24 --> 3347.2799999999997
to be how to say in a graph put it in a

3341.04 --> 3350.57
graph it's going to be like this or the

3347.28 --> 3355.4700000000003
opposite like the bigger the container

3350.57 --> 3364.04
the higher the differential and the

3355.47 --> 3364.04
higher the pressure let's see

3365.91 --> 3372.89
right the higher pressure the more what

3369.33 --> 3379.08
is it emphasized the gradient will be

3372.89 --> 3381.9
but it's always gonna be yeah in a in a

3379.08 --> 3385.7999999999997
linear fashion maybe yeah it's never

3381.9 --> 3389.57
gonna be spiking up the gradient never

3385.8 --> 3395.01
forms with significant high pressure and

3389.57 --> 3396.81
then it keeps on going forever in a

3395.01 --> 3399.75
stable situation now of course the earth

3396.81 --> 3402.9
realm it also produces gases as

3399.75 --> 3406.08
ground-based there's some influence so

3402.9 --> 3409.13
that makes yeah in homogeneous mass of

3406.08 --> 3412.35
the content of the of the realm is tough

3409.13 --> 3415.77
the size are properly so yeah you can't

3412.35 --> 3418.08
include those factors so if you exclude

3415.77 --> 3419.37
them in such an experiment when testing

3418.08 --> 3422.04
the gradient I'm pretty sure you're

3419.37 --> 3425.3399999999997
gonna find out that it's gonna be pretty

3422.04 --> 3428.61
linear how the gradient always works and

3425.34 --> 3430.7400000000002
that means that it's not gonna be some

3428.61 --> 3433.56
part within the container it's gonna

3430.74 --> 3436.5
have like this significant amount of

3433.56 --> 3439.08
pressure and then suddenly go up up up

3436.5 --> 3441.03
up and then keep on getting smaller and

3439.08 --> 3444.87
smaller and smaller and credit to an

3441.03 --> 3447.8300000000004
incredible amount where the volume where

3444.87 --> 3451.68
the pressure is significantly less is

3447.83 --> 3454.47
much bigger in volume of the entire

3451.68 --> 3456.87
container that parts then that small

3454.47 --> 3460.95
layer of higher pressure that never

3456.87 --> 3463.38
works that way never pretty damn sure of

3460.95 --> 3465.8999999999996
it so there's the gradient is always

3463.38 --> 3468.75
going to be divided among the entire

3465.9 --> 3470.85
container in a certain fashion and now

3468.75 --> 3473.07
of course the earth is a dynamic system

3470.85 --> 3475.95
with gases also being produced at ground

3473.07 --> 3480.7400000000002
level and constant motion so that makes

3475.95 --> 3483.4399999999996
it a little more difficult but yeah

3480.74 --> 3486.81
that's never gonna be made easy for us

3483.44 --> 3488.7000000000003
but if you study gradients within gases

3486.81 --> 3492.04
I'm pretty sure you're gonna end up with

3488.7 --> 3495.1699999999996
what I just suggested

3492.04 --> 3495.17
[Music]

3495.69 --> 3501.099
yeah I am answering the question I am

3498.519 --> 3509.14
absolutely answering the question in

3501.099 --> 3510.46
every freaking detail Brenda why is

3509.14 --> 3514.749
there a gradients

3510.46 --> 3516.759
no I don't give a whatever I don't care

3514.749 --> 3518.8799999999997
why there is a gradient I all I know is

3516.759 --> 3525.88
is there is a gradient and it happens

3518.88 --> 3530.1400000000003
and I don't give a fleeting horse manure

3525.88 --> 3533.9500000000003
about whatever you want to demand that

3530.14 --> 3539.14
it must be causing gravity greatest

3533.95 --> 3541.21
cosmic reverie hmm I don't care don't

3539.14 --> 3543.46
care there is no proof or router you

3541.21 --> 3547.119
don't even know what it is it's a giant

3543.46 --> 3549.609
mess you cling on to a fantasy of mass

3547.119 --> 3552.609
attracting mass while at the same time

3549.609 --> 3556.72
the one originally coming out with that

3552.609 --> 3559.21
officially disclaims it being real by

3556.72 --> 3561.18
not claiming a hypothesis and yet

3559.21 --> 3564.729
everybody clings on and make the

3561.18 --> 3567.779
calculation mishaps they're mock-ups

3564.729 --> 3570.46
worse and worse and worse as they go

3567.779 --> 3572.94
yeah that is an answer to the question

3570.46 --> 3572.94
Brenda

3580.21 --> 3584.68
don't talk to me like that

3598.41 --> 3606.29
I would what stop unorthodox

3601.98 --> 3610.07
are you trying to be a smartass about I

3606.29 --> 3610.07
don't think it's gonna work

3617.88 --> 3623.09
[Music]

3623.36 --> 3630.56
now Karen B I was just timing her out

3625.79 --> 3632.87
because she's like caps so ludicrously

3630.56 --> 3634.79
she's trying to literally erupted us and

3632.87 --> 3639.85
I answered the question I answered every

3634.79 --> 3639.85
one of your ridiculous questions Brenda

3646.339 --> 3654.41
oh really that's incorrect Ragnar Stefan

3651.949 --> 3658.67
Alison you can have a pressure gradient

3654.41 --> 3662.3289999999997
within a closed pressurized system where

3658.67 --> 3663.439
do you come up with that [ __ ] are you

3662.329 --> 3666.65
insane

3663.439 --> 3674.2889999999998
yes you can provably so it's very easy

3666.65 --> 3674.289
to do especially if tanner is sizable

3674.589 --> 3684.529
gradients form can be closed it'll sail

3679.369 --> 3686.6890000000003
form so to claim that you can't have a

3684.529 --> 3689.349
gradient in a closed pressurized system

3686.689 --> 3693.489
that's just insane

3689.349 --> 3693.489
why do you get that [ __ ]

3711.68 --> 3722.45
yeah yeah I knew it see they claim the

3718.1 --> 3724.0099999999998
gradient exists because of gravity even

3722.45 --> 3726.5899999999997
though they don't even know what gravity

3724.01 --> 3729.0800000000004
is they have their fantasies about how

3726.59 --> 3732.6400000000003
it's supposed to do that or conceptually

3729.08 --> 3736.43
what should be going on the presupposed

3732.64 --> 3739.0099999999998
force this equilibrium field being

3736.43 --> 3742.46
applied to all things right that

3739.01 --> 3744.3500000000004
conceptual thing oh yeah that

3742.46 --> 3746.78
conceptually would definitely create

3744.35 --> 3748.88
that the problem is there is no grip

3746.78 --> 3750.4700000000003
there is no proofer and whatsoever there

3748.88 --> 3752.06
is a lot of proof or relative density

3750.47 --> 3755.27
though and yeah that leaves a lot of

3752.06 --> 3759.98
open questions that are not going to be

3755.27 --> 3762.44
answered get over it and have some

3759.98 --> 3764.18
patience maybe because yeah who knows at

3762.44 --> 3765.53
some point might be figured out what's

3764.18 --> 3768.0499999999997
actually causing it and we might

3765.53 --> 3770.75
actually know more about the confines of

3768.05 --> 3774.29
our realm that's all gonna be very

3770.75 --> 3776.45
helpful figuring out like yeah why but

3774.29 --> 3778.55
it's not freaking gravity you don't even

3776.45 --> 3783.0499999999997
know what gravity is you have no

3778.55 --> 3785.6800000000003
foundation it's all just fantasy and

3783.05 --> 3785.6800000000003
hearsay

3800.09 --> 3806.51
you don't know why it's cost and people

3804.6 --> 3811.71
like to think even who like it has to be

3806.51 --> 3815.09
the polarization and then yeah I would

3811.71 --> 3819.51
displace that like that and this force

3815.09 --> 3823.05
in magnet whatever is gonna yeah then it

3819.51 --> 3825.75
that has to be it because something has

3823.05 --> 3827.4
to cause the gradient and things to be

3825.75 --> 3829.2
the way they does right that's how

3827.4 --> 3833.1
everybody keeps on thinking instead of

3829.2 --> 3835.7999999999997
just noticing like hey has that ever

3833.1 --> 3839.81
changed yeah it's always like that that

3835.8 --> 3846.5
nothing seems to influence it well why

3839.81 --> 3849.54
would you then want to even figure out

3846.5 --> 3852.63
like what it is when you can create

3849.54 --> 3857.66
things to counter the effects of it

3852.63 --> 3862.17
apparently the electrostatics can do

3857.66 --> 3865.44
well a parent gravity neutralizing

3862.17 --> 3867.51
effects so suggested but that doesn't

3865.44 --> 3869.85
prove gravity it just proves there's a

3867.51 --> 3875.1600000000003
thing in technology out there whatever

3869.85 --> 3877.17
that just neutralized that effect that

3875.16 --> 3879.72
we don't know what it is and is

3877.17 --> 3881.78
popularly called gravity for no good

3879.72 --> 3881.7799999999997
reason

3881.98 --> 3885.309
[Music]

3888.02 --> 3890.8
what is that

3894.1 --> 3900.3399999999997
satlink Adam all right

3903.099 --> 3908.7090000000003
can we get a different pressure gradient

3906.249 --> 3912.279
in a sealed container from goodtimz row

3908.709 --> 3914.769
yeah that's a good video yeah you know

3912.279 --> 3923.199
what just to poke at everyone I'll show

3914.769 --> 3924.729
it I mean at the you know why not yeah

3923.199 --> 3930.849
you're not monitored yeah she would have

3924.729 --> 3932.9199999999996
permission to do that so hello everybody

3930.849 --> 3934.599
out there in your tube and good times

3932.92 --> 3937.869
for all exactly to Bob it here if you

3934.599 --> 3943.63
prefer in this video we're going to

3937.869 --> 3946.029
explain what we're doing here and this

3943.63 --> 3951.4590000000003
is just a very rough start folks what we

3946.029 --> 3953.529
have is a bucket of ice water okay this

3951.459 --> 3960.069
is a little too warm to be touching

3953.529 --> 3962.019
right now this is one of these turned

3960.069 --> 3965.859
over it has one of these in the bottom

3962.019 --> 3975.519
of it upside down in the ice it is held

3965.859 --> 3977.3489999999997
it hold its held open right now so and

3975.519 --> 3980.319
that hose is coming out right here and

3977.349 --> 3988.089
it runs up to this pressure reading

3980.319 --> 3992.68
gauge right here which as you can see is

3988.089 --> 3995.069
right at about three and this one is

3992.68 --> 3998.109
right at about it's under two and a half

3995.069 --> 4001.459
almost a two what I've done is I've

3998.109 --> 4003.69
taken this heating gun up to 800 degrees

4001.459 --> 4006.69
and then we have the bucket of ice water

4003.69 --> 4010.83
at the bottom and I'm changing the

4006.69 --> 4014.07
temperature hopefully at both ends

4010.83 --> 4018.24
we have the cold at the bottom and the

4014.07 --> 4021.7200000000003
heat at the top and what we're finding

4018.24 --> 4028.9399999999996
is that we're getting a little bit more

4021.72 --> 4031.5899999999997
pressure on the bottom just a hair

4028.94 --> 4035.31
possibly what we really need is another

4031.59 --> 4037.92
one of these gauges right here now in

4035.31 --> 4039.7799999999997
fact these gauges may not be 100%

4037.92 --> 4042.36
accurate they're old some of them are

4039.78 --> 4044.19
sticky so this is really just a rough

4042.36 --> 4045.9300000000003
start folks it may not actually be doing

4044.19 --> 4048.51
what it looks like it appeared to be

4045.93 --> 4058.02
doing but that one's it about you they

4048.51 --> 4063.32
need this one it appears that it's at

4058.02 --> 4063.32
about three so we have you know

4065.11 --> 4074.13
we need better equipment but I think we

4067.96 --> 4076.42
can get pressure change from one

4074.13 --> 4079.63
gradient to another inside a sealed

4076.42 --> 4084.31
container there is definitely a huge

4079.63 --> 4086.77
heat swings that we have here on earth

4084.31 --> 4089.08
as you go up it gets much colder and

4086.77 --> 4091.15
then the first getting warmer again it's

4089.08 --> 4094.2999999999997
a much much warmer the highest I've seen

4091.15 --> 4096.609
it still only gets like the seven

4094.3 --> 4098.9400000000005
degrees but it was negative 65 at one

4096.609 --> 4101.319
point and then it starts warming up so

4098.94 --> 4102.879999999999
so I started instead of doing the heat

4101.319 --> 4104.56
on the bottom and the cold on the top I

4102.88 --> 4110.26
did the heat on the top and the cold on

4104.56 --> 4113.47
the bottom and we're just this is trial

4110.26 --> 4115.96
number one you're seeing right here so

4113.47 --> 4118.299
I'm really just throwing this out here

4115.96 --> 4120.64
so on other people can you maybe try it

4118.299 --> 4123.04
or give me some ideas to make it better

4120.64 --> 4127.42
really I've shared this with the guys

4123.04 --> 4129.76
over at iron round talking about not

4127.42 --> 4132.609
here this weekend Friday maybe we'll do

4129.76 --> 4135.04
a live test see if we can maybe find

4132.609 --> 4137.9800000000005
some some other gauges or something like

4135.04 --> 4143.68
that and get this thing really dialed in

4137.98 --> 4145.419999999999
maybe get a bigger container video we

4143.68 --> 4155.589
had to weld that on there we walled it a

4145.42 --> 4157.299
couple washers so we could then put some

4155.589 --> 4161.5599999999995
threads in it so then we could screw

4157.299 --> 4165.13
that into it and then that now I'll show

4161.56 --> 4167.200000000001
you is that they're connected I'll show

4165.13 --> 4171.18
you right here I'm gonna open this and

4167.2 --> 4171.179999999999
it's still like three as you can see

4174.92 --> 4181.559
hard to call but as I open this and let

4178.799 --> 4183.71
this out this one's going to go down as

4181.559 --> 4183.71
well

4192.989 --> 4207.08
so that's a zero so a little bit of

4204.45 --> 4207.08
pressure in there

4207.95 --> 4214.11
where's that off yeah this one even

4212.73 --> 4216.9
hasn't gone to all the way down to zero

4214.11 --> 4222.719
either there's the zero there as you can

4216.9 --> 4224.37
see and then when we fill it up I'll

4222.719 --> 4230.43
show you real quick what I'm gonna do is

4224.37 --> 4232.82
blow hit air up into here hold on one

4230.43 --> 4232.820000000001
second
