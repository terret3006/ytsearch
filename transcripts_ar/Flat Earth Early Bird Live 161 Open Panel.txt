3.859 --> 12.509
okay my internet connection died now

8.849 --> 21.240000000000002
you're back you know I hope it's still

12.509 --> 24.18
oh no the video cut off Masen life of

21.24 --> 27.839999999999996
course oh my god I thought you were just

24.18 --> 33.93
having a job this is the early bird show

27.84 --> 36.03
every day always obviously what I call

33.93 --> 38.1
that something is you yeah all right

36.03 --> 40.95
oh it's been a good one then yeah well

38.1 --> 42.989000000000004
it's it's the open panel show I do this

40.95 --> 44.940000000000005
is Sunday because Nathan doesn't have

42.989 --> 48.059
his debates as usual so I just put out

44.94 --> 48.539
the panel open and take as long as I can

48.059 --> 54.539
handle

48.539 --> 56.370000000000005
although I am kind of hungry though but

54.539 --> 58.02
yeah my internet connection just broke

56.37 --> 60.449
down I don't know if the video is now

58.02 --> 65.01
still continuing or if it's gonna start

60.449 --> 71.24
a new one I hope not but you will see

65.01 --> 71.24000000000001
eventually but what are we talking about

71.72 --> 79.11
that oh sorry miss ano I think I did you

76.71 --> 82.5
get the whole thing about the New World

79.11 --> 85.14
Order not being unipolar there's no one

82.5 --> 87.54
single controller I explain the love of

85.14 --> 89.4
it I don't know how much was caught off

87.54 --> 92.49000000000001
I got it

89.4 --> 96.27000000000001
normal it was okay I will yeah I'd I'd

92.49 --> 98.579
wait on and I'd went on a what you call

96.27 --> 102.63
I just believe that it's an evil entity

98.579 --> 104.85
part of consciousness Oh evil is a part

102.63 --> 106.649
of it it's part of the methodology they

104.85 --> 110.30999999999999
use yeah and I think nothing creepy

106.649 --> 114.45
voice principal as it were yeah behind

110.31 --> 116.34
see that possibly as a conscious evil

114.45 --> 119.659
consciousness suit so you know what is

116.34 --> 122.04
doing and that's the very tool

119.659 --> 124.17
it's the methodology it's not a

122.04 --> 126.96000000000001
consciousness although the consciousness

124.17 --> 128.819
will change in accordance with the

126.96 --> 131.73
methodology that is used by the

128.819 --> 132.97
individuals that happens they turn to it

131.73 --> 135.54999999999998
they are corrupted

132.97 --> 138.27
the methods they use that's how it works

135.55 --> 141.34
that's how everything works

138.27 --> 142.9
so yeah they will yeah we do react to

141.34 --> 146.05
the environment I wouldn't read enough

142.9 --> 148.96
you know we do act you know we are yeah

146.05 --> 150.76000000000002
we react to other environment and our we

148.96 --> 152.98000000000002
think it's like I don't know it's a long

150.76 --> 155.26
discussion we always react our

152.98 --> 157.06
environment but the way we react is

155.26 --> 160.17999999999998
based on the principles and those

157.06 --> 164.05
principles will shape the consciousness

160.18 --> 167.35
of the person using those principles

164.05 --> 172.29000000000002
ya know imagine that you can create the

167.35 --> 174.60999999999999
environment then you get people to react

172.29 --> 176.709
then you've got control and that's

174.61 --> 178.66000000000003
what's basically happening oh yeah the

176.709 --> 181.09
control to position concept they

178.66 --> 182.43
definitely try to use it as much as

181.09 --> 184.59
possible even

182.43 --> 187.06
industrialize that you could consider

184.59 --> 189.16
well yeah they have done only

187.06 --> 192.58
industrialized already right and

189.16 --> 195.34
systematically apply it almost publicly

192.58 --> 198.36
saying like yeah we do this you can do

195.34 --> 204.76
this too trying to normalize it

198.36 --> 207.43
yeah yeah yeah right but yeah still the

204.76 --> 209.82999999999998
same concept stance it's all about the

207.43 --> 213.16
principles if you're gonna allow certain

209.83 --> 216.25
principles to to be assimilated in the

213.16 --> 219.43
way you do things even if just to engage

216.25 --> 223.66
with a group or a system then those

219.43 --> 225.19
principles will shape you whether you

223.66 --> 229.019
believe it or not whether you

225.19 --> 229.019
underestimate it or not

229.65 --> 236.29
it always does it always gets back at

232.209 --> 238.39000000000001
you everything has a price oh yeah good

236.29 --> 240.37
principles has a price and bad

238.39 --> 242.47
principles has a price it's all a matter

240.37 --> 245.23000000000002
of what price do you wanna pay and are

242.47 --> 247.78
you smart enough to be realistic about

245.23 --> 250.54
it ahead of time because it's very

247.78 --> 252.67
difficult usually at the time you make

250.54 --> 254.29
these types of principled choices to

252.67 --> 255.73
really size up what the actual

254.29 --> 259.69
consequences are because there's so many

255.73 --> 260.34999999999997
delusions about it in the world yeah

259.69 --> 265.63
exactly

260.35 --> 271.02000000000004
exam do you believe in karma karma

265.63 --> 274.51
oh yeah yeah see well not in a

271.02 --> 276.93
post-mortem Karma but I believe in a

274.51 --> 281.26
direct energy balance

276.93 --> 283.24
it's do you think juice and it can

281.26 --> 285.7
express itself like the consciousness

283.24 --> 288.94
already and express itself through the

285.7 --> 293.05
external world have you ever tried to

288.94 --> 295.33
manipulator you can never let me

293.05 --> 297.58
complete we can manipulate karma it's a

295.33 --> 300.84999999999997
side effect you can either cause it or

297.58 --> 302.83
not cause it yeah yeah I'll be playing

300.85 --> 303.70000000000005
with it more like it's billions but

302.83 --> 306.52
that's stupid

303.7 --> 308.97999999999996
yeah you can create [ __ ] you know you

306.52 --> 310.83
can do stupid mean things for no reason

308.98 --> 313.81
and then get the Karma for it yeah I

310.83 --> 317.03999999999996
literally experience all the ways I'm

313.81 --> 320.41
talking about doing good stuff to Oh God

317.04 --> 322.75
can flow Karma traditionally karma is

320.41 --> 326.07000000000005
considered to be a negative side effect

322.75 --> 328.36
it's very fluid oh yeah it is

326.07 --> 333.34
otherwise you're talking about Dharma I

328.36 --> 335.2
think right doing good things I don't

333.34 --> 336.54999999999995
know maybe I'm mixing it up yeah yep no

335.2 --> 339.58
no yup yup yeah yup

336.55 --> 341.59000000000003
if so that's what is called Dharma then

339.58 --> 344.68
all right that's when you doings like

341.59 --> 348.64
doing good alright doing God will be

344.68 --> 352.93
rewarded by energy by either energy from

348.64 --> 354.88
the inside by other positive resonance

352.93 --> 358.24
from the outside and the same goes for

354.88 --> 361.3
karma for the darkness now rightly so

358.24 --> 363.16
Karma's the bad and Damas a good right

361.3 --> 367.99
okay cuz I've been seeing Karma I've

363.16 --> 370.72
been coming throughout from the 80s on

367.99 --> 370.90000000000003
karma was always the word to use for

370.72 --> 373.51000000000005
that

370.9 --> 375.28
so it wasn't I go through a Western

373.51 --> 378.78999999999996
mistake that's been persisting for a

375.28 --> 382.75
very long time because yeah it is it

378.79 --> 387.46000000000004
really does route in the in the Hindu

382.75 --> 389.32
religion which is preaching to me I just

387.46 --> 391.78
thought it made what you put out there

389.32 --> 394.9
you go by anything

391.78 --> 396.4
the last Dharma is a yeah

394.9 --> 400.0
can you do

396.4 --> 404.26
indeed doing good little rewards from

400.0 --> 406.12
the inside or the out alright

404.26 --> 407.8
she lit up something new everyday line

406.12 --> 410.26
you're never too old to it well Marvin

407.8 --> 413.729
just remember how could you imagine that

410.26 --> 416.199
you were too old to learn Oh No

413.729 --> 420.19
then you'd either be like totally

416.199 --> 423.729
inwards once the old man that just can't

420.19 --> 426.04
remember anything or they'll be so

423.729 --> 429.43
freaking wise that nothing can teach you

426.04 --> 436.69
anything anymore you talking about the

429.43 --> 438.52
ball because that's what the that's what

436.69 --> 442.66
you were describing they'll immediately

438.52 --> 446.85999999999996
I mean well obviously balls in a way

442.66 --> 450.22
they are very young old men that's right

446.86 --> 455.289
yeah there's a new generation of old men

450.22 --> 457.56
they they're not old yet though but when

455.289 --> 462.18
they're old it'll probably fit perfectly

457.56 --> 462.18
there will be stereotyped characters

463.53 --> 467.85999999999996
anyway I hope I never lose

465.82 --> 470.229
I hope I never lose that enthusiasm and

467.86 --> 472.38
will always I was on a chart Leo it

470.229 --> 475.06
that's one album I asked that question

472.38 --> 477.07
there's a gang Charlie I think you know

475.06 --> 480.16
and a guy you met on slobs mascot so

477.07 --> 482.62
enemy and what talk then ask them

480.16 --> 485.74
equation assist like I said I've got a

482.62 --> 489.27
series question I do do what in one yeah

485.74 --> 492.52
I said if the force of gravity is 9.8

489.27 --> 494.94899999999996
meters per se they're all high yes an

492.52 --> 498.669
examination yeah it's not the force it's

494.949 --> 502.15000000000003
an acceleration it's just like what

498.669 --> 505.27
speed would it be doing you know if a

502.15 --> 508.12
police I've done like the police do if I

505.27 --> 510.58
if the object was falling is how fast

508.12 --> 513.4
would it be what what speed they be

510.58 --> 516.0989999999999
doing if I took a measurement of the

513.4 --> 519.37
speed II was doing after 10 seconds and

516.099 --> 521.979
you know you couldn't they wouldn't

519.37 --> 524.92
answer and that Charlie was given

521.979 --> 528.19
equations and stuff like I've been told

524.92 --> 530.27
or it'll be after ten seconds will be

528.19 --> 532.8800000000001
lovin it name to eat

530.27 --> 533.51
amiable sayings will come out of a

532.88 --> 536.6899999999999
bottle

533.51 --> 538.91
why screw ya because it's an

536.69 --> 541.46
acceleration rate it's exponential

538.91 --> 543.62
that's why it's squared yeah but what

541.46 --> 545.75
but they're still they're still the air

543.62 --> 548.27
friction though that'll stop it and I'll

545.75 --> 550.61
give it a maximum speed eventually if

548.27 --> 554.39
you square a number what are you doing

550.61 --> 556.37
with that you're creating an exponential

554.39 --> 558.5889999999999
growth factor about it well you're

556.37 --> 560.93
multiplying it by yourself but that's

558.589 --> 563.1800000000001
what an exponential growing factor it

560.93 --> 565.79
said it's an extract it's a mathematical

563.18 --> 567.9799999999999
extract that they explains the

565.79 --> 569.87
acceleration rate that's why that is

567.98 --> 574.22
it's a mathematical deduction based

569.87 --> 577.58
system exactly so therefore how can it

574.22 --> 583.4300000000001
be only traveling at 90 E or e mio

577.58 --> 587.089
spacings will after 10 C because from a

583.43 --> 589.67
steel standpoint it just takes a certain

587.089 --> 592.19
while to accelerate this just a skill in

589.67 --> 594.17
how much it will how much the speed will

592.19 --> 597.47
be over time and apparently that's

594.17 --> 600.4699999999999
ninety eight meters a second after ten

597.47 --> 602.839
days I don't know right yeah but okay

600.47 --> 604.61
that I did and it's not it's not that

602.839 --> 609.32
this is a genuine question I'm gonna

604.61 --> 611.9
answer you right as that if it's after

609.32 --> 616.5500000000001
one Finnegan is nine point eighty meals

611.9 --> 618.74
or six wheel so what can you square when

616.55 --> 621.5
it's two seconds do you square the

618.74 --> 623.529
Tuesday cancer is named for and then you

621.5 --> 627.08
multiply the nine point eight by four

623.529 --> 629.72
first to know the second squared is the

627.08 --> 632.99
stable factor it's the nine put eight

629.72 --> 635.9300000000001
meters you have also minded quite ain't

632.99 --> 638.63
meters and then after two seconds it

635.93 --> 642.079
falls nine point eight meters times nine

638.63 --> 644.65
point eight meters right exactly it

642.079 --> 647.18
should do that but they see it doesn't

644.65 --> 649.1
because night or maybe it's the second

647.18 --> 651.1999999999999
square maybe I'm turning it around now

649.1 --> 654.14
maybe although you have used you've

651.2 --> 656.63
you've said exactly haha who assumed it

654.14 --> 659.9
could be exactly you see exactly have it

656.63 --> 661.49
seems logical because if the second

659.9 --> 662.63
would be bigger than it would actually

661.49 --> 665.75
slow down

662.63 --> 671.75
but it's about the total velocity not

665.75 --> 676.97
about the distance that's being done now

671.75 --> 679.1
last I hate I hate math yeah why Howard

676.97 --> 682.13
you know why you're struggling with on

679.1 --> 684.649
is because without explaining it wrong

682.13 --> 686.509
because after two seconds according to

684.649 --> 687.889
Maya we'll be doing around a hundred

686.509 --> 695.42
meters per second

687.889 --> 698.1800000000001
yes no but not entirely true though

695.42 --> 700.069
because there it misses the air friction

698.18 --> 702.709
factor and it must be the more

700.069 --> 704.42
destructive that you can forget stop

702.709 --> 705.6099999999999
that don't stop but that's what they

704.42 --> 709.0999999999999
start

705.61 --> 711.5600000000001
it really does it excludes it it should

709.1 --> 714.259
it become it should be in a vacuum name

711.56 --> 717.29
right let's do it in a vacuum it doesn't

714.259 --> 719.3290000000001
right Falls really quickly in a vacuum

717.29 --> 721.819
compared to it really

719.329 --> 722.75
so there's no terminal velocity because

721.819 --> 725.18
of this it's

722.75 --> 727.31
oakley's determined not in a vacuum

725.18 --> 729.2299999999999
there's no terminal velocity in a vacuum

727.31 --> 731.63
what there is in the atmosphere yes

729.23 --> 733.759
there is right okay so let's let us one

731.63 --> 736.759
thing so let's go to my question again

733.759 --> 738.6800000000001
so in a vacuum an object falling out the

736.759 --> 741.74
speed of gravity or the acceleration

738.68 --> 743.7399999999999
speed the glass after to say and then in

741.74 --> 747.62
theory it should be going a hundred

743.74 --> 750.4300000000001
meters that's almost an a main point

747.62 --> 753.649
here is a bit ninety something

750.43 --> 755.8389999999999
it's nearly a hundred meals for steak

753.649 --> 756.949
and square that for two seconds bow is

755.839 --> 760.009
told is nayi

756.949 --> 764.0889999999999
point eight meters per second square

760.009 --> 767.089
that's 13 say and I don't understand why

764.089 --> 769.1
I had a boat Milan I think I was taught

767.089 --> 771.0790000000001
you scream when you square a number you

769.1 --> 775.6990000000001
multiply it by yourself but I'm I'm

771.079 --> 777.3499999999999
wrong that's why I will so so they have

775.699 --> 780.319
a problem with our it could have

777.35 --> 782.86
anything but you don't have to change

780.319 --> 786.05
shaking spoon unknowing miles an hour

782.86 --> 788.72
all right that's not bad you know I mean

786.05 --> 791.2299999999999
it's gonna beg non Boltzmann

788.72 --> 793.6700000000001
so I don't believe the acceleration crap

791.23 --> 794.99
no it's just a deduction

793.67 --> 798.89
it's a deduction

794.99 --> 801.5
tied in with the concept of gravity like

798.89 --> 803.54
with the presumed explanation of the

801.5 --> 804.38
aberration basically but it's only a

803.54 --> 808.2199999999999
deduction

804.38 --> 810.62
it's mathematics no no no it's a

808.22 --> 813.9100000000001
deduction and then a conclusion is drawn

810.62 --> 817.3100000000001
to that derived from it mathematically

813.91 --> 819.62
but it's just it's just an observation

817.31 --> 822.38
it's a deduction like Oh an acceleration

819.62 --> 825.05
rate why would that be why is it

822.38 --> 826.73
accelerating and then gravity

825.05 --> 828.68
it could be relative density of course

826.73 --> 830.39
it's the same concept it's just if you

828.68 --> 833.0889999999999
apply a force yeah I will accelerate

830.39 --> 836.959
that's how movement tends to work from a

833.089 --> 838.6400000000001
standstill point so apply forces and in

836.959 --> 842.06
the case of gravity you just don't

838.64 --> 845.6899999999999
assume gravity and you just displace the

842.06 --> 848.75
effect to the displacement caused by

845.69 --> 851.7790000000001
relative density and yep basically the

848.75 --> 854.0
same thing but scientific you know

851.779 --> 857.87
everything point over the mathematics is

854.0 --> 860.329
totally wrong as well right it's hogwash

857.87 --> 862.54
that's how you get away with it no give

860.329 --> 865.79
really you know D really looks at the

862.54 --> 868.25
the mathematics or finds little problems

865.79 --> 871.31
like that you know is it's a problem I

868.25 --> 874.01
still haven't had it explained to maybe

871.31 --> 875.9899999999999
three times in different ways and if

874.01 --> 879.17
these same mathematics is reality the

875.99 --> 880.399
last not bialy because that object what

879.17 --> 882.62
speed is it for now

880.399 --> 885.17
in the atmosphere of Galileo measure

882.62 --> 888.26
there is 60 people take when he dropped

885.17 --> 890.87
us assume bombs from the Tarot but she

888.26 --> 893.66
probably never done but these teenager

890.87 --> 897.68
veneral atmosphere least 16 forsaken

893.66 --> 900.73
objects for so it's about definitely

897.68 --> 902.959
named for ye well that's for the Vatican

900.73 --> 905.77
but they just make look they're just

902.959 --> 910.04
making this crap on it you know and this

905.77 --> 912.3199999999999
yeah people know know what these are all

910.04 --> 914.9499999999999
genuine things that are there it's just

912.32 --> 917.899
that they constantly funnel all these

914.95 --> 920.3900000000001
all these sightings all these elements

917.899 --> 922.339
all these observations and they funnel

920.39 --> 925.3389999999999
their presuppositional system through it

922.339 --> 928.37
like it like a sleight-of-hand trick

925.339 --> 930.32
like oh yeah and you assume that

928.37 --> 933.38
and just quickly bypass it so you are

930.32 --> 934.85
going on assuming band without even

933.38 --> 936.77
realizing it that's what they do

934.85 --> 939.2
constantly they trick you into

936.77 --> 941.5889999999999
presupposing without you realizing it

939.2 --> 944.6600000000001
but these things are real they're real

941.589 --> 947.4200000000001
observations they're real deductions

944.66 --> 949.67
that are solid the data is real it was

947.42 --> 953.17
just their conclusions are just being

949.67 --> 956.15
pre supposed to without openly saying

953.17 --> 960.5889999999999
well it's not it's not sneaking it's not

956.15 --> 963.14
sneak of course it's because I wasn't

960.589 --> 966.7700000000001
talking about I'm seeing it's late

963.14 --> 971.75
that sneaky one gravity right what they

966.77 --> 975.11
do is as the UC or if things like for

971.75 --> 978.26
objects take celery the force now are

975.11 --> 980.24
well agree if if you are throwing an

978.26 --> 982.4
object sideways or pushing it sideways

980.24 --> 987.529
or whatever maybe you can prove that

982.4 --> 989.6
force how you cannot prove that I'm a

987.529 --> 991.85
fat packing object off and late and that

989.6 --> 993.5600000000001
crap about what I'm hoping the force

991.85 --> 997.01
sent here button because I pick up

993.56 --> 1000.8499999999999
that's bollocks the fact is they cannot

997.01 --> 1002.83
prove that when I draw an object I'm

1000.85 --> 1004.45
putting a force on it was more force

1002.83 --> 1006.7900000000001
they can't prove those are force being

1004.45 --> 1009.25
examined up or not you can prove it for

1006.79 --> 1011.3199999999999
lift right up no but you can though

1009.25 --> 1014.05
yeah so what should know but yeah dari

1011.32 --> 1016.69
you carry them all on all you can

1014.05 --> 1019.99
definitely prove a force but you can

1016.69 --> 1022.4200000000001
prove that it is a force field a

1019.99 --> 1025.0
universal force field like gravity is

1022.42 --> 1028.1499999999999
just ascribing displacement caused by

1025.0 --> 1032.02
relative density true designed very

1028.15 --> 1034.6000000000001
simple you drop it the object they all

1032.02 --> 1035.679
hold on you let it go you let it go the

1034.6 --> 1038.3799999999999
object immediately

1035.679 --> 1041.5790000000002
now having maneuverability within the

1038.38 --> 1044.8290000000002
space is going to seek its equilibrium

1041.579 --> 1046.6599999999999
level for its relative density within

1044.829 --> 1049.1789999999999
the spectrum of all things it's going to

1046.66 --> 1053.44
do that immediately the erting is force

1049.179 --> 1057.16
to be caused in the moment because the

1053.44 --> 1059.3200000000002
relative density difference towards its

1057.16 --> 1061.24
equilibrium point and that's the force

1059.32 --> 1062.6499999999999
that is the force that's initiated

1061.24 --> 1065.49
wait a

1062.65 --> 1068.47
mess of force when it lands right

1065.49 --> 1070.15
mulberry is a surface tension force

1068.47 --> 1073.75
that'll prevent it from what singling

1070.15 --> 1076.24
one see but you cannot prove that there

1073.75 --> 1079.96
was a force opponent when I dropped it

1076.24 --> 1082.15
when I let go over four still with

1079.96 --> 1084.82
inherently its inherent to matter it's

1082.15 --> 1086.95
because of the relative density as long

1084.82 --> 1089.83
as the relative the object and its

1086.95 --> 1092.02
relative density is not in its

1089.83 --> 1095.23
equilibrium level for whatever reason

1092.02 --> 1098.44
once again Oh free rooms of course will

1095.23 --> 1100.24
be initiated this is already initiating

1098.44 --> 1102.3700000000001
but it's being stalked by mechanical

1100.24 --> 1105.28
things surrounding it preventing it from

1102.37 --> 1108.31
maneuvering yeah yeah but the thing is

1105.28 --> 1111.43
you can't prove up a force enough no but

1108.31 --> 1114.22
you don't have to put a force in it it's

1111.43 --> 1117.0700000000002
there it's always there it's inherent

1114.22 --> 1119.8
part of relative density it all just

1117.07 --> 1121.75
depends on its maneuvering ability and

1119.8 --> 1124.45
where it is in the relative density

1121.75 --> 1127.63
spectrum of all things the force is

1124.45 --> 1131.5
there inherently in the relative density

1127.63 --> 1132.22
disequilibrium but it's not a foursome

1131.5 --> 1134.74
yes it is

1132.22 --> 1137.41
because it causes displacement in

1134.74 --> 1137.71
accordance to acceleration ah there you

1137.41 --> 1140.3500000000001
go

1137.71 --> 1142.99
exactly and that's how forces are that's

1140.35 --> 1145.09
now forces are a fine now this is we and

1142.99 --> 1147.34
your average listen no that goes back to

1145.09 --> 1149.77
my point that was exactly back from upon

1147.34 --> 1152.5
your reference and the laws of

1149.77 --> 1155.59
acceleration overall or that law right

1152.5 --> 1158.53
but that law that law can only be proven

1155.59 --> 1164.61
if I'm gonna push something pull off

1158.53 --> 1164.61
through it not drop no and that's we are

1168.0 --> 1171.31
not sure it is not true and I meet my

1170.95 --> 1173.77
point

1171.31 --> 1176.6399999999999
it is not true it's not it's not true in

1173.77 --> 1179.47
your nice but usual don't have to use

1176.64 --> 1181.9
external or other things in order to

1179.47 --> 1183.7
initiate a force a force is there if

1181.9 --> 1186.0400000000002
there is displacement it's all about

1183.7 --> 1187.99
getting the cause of the force and if

1186.04 --> 1191.32
you presume it's gravity then you have

1187.99 --> 1194.05
no cause but that isn't a force it's not

1191.32 --> 1195.7
a force displacement is a force and if

1194.05 --> 1198.1599999999999
you caused by relative density

1195.7 --> 1201.04
which is provable by the scientific

1198.16 --> 1203.5
method yes it is it's a force there's

1201.04 --> 1206.05
inherent relative to me when it's not in

1203.5 --> 1209.83
its equilibrium point as long as it has

1206.05 --> 1212.9199999999998
maneuvering room it is it's their

1209.83 --> 1217.48
inherent to run displacement is caused

1212.92 --> 1219.63
by wait no wait wait is no awareness

1217.48 --> 1222.19
concept

1219.63 --> 1225.4
Wieters no no it's a gravity based

1222.19 --> 1229.27
concept no wheat wheat is a densities in

1225.4 --> 1233.5600000000002
my body based concept Ally oh and then a

1229.27 --> 1236.5
wheat is as all as a gravity based

1233.56 --> 1239.35
concept no yes it is

1236.5 --> 1241.96
don't argue me about gravity me study

1239.35 --> 1245.02
this [ __ ] after detail in three years

1241.96 --> 1248.14
Ally we I don't care how many years

1245.02 --> 1252.25
weeks as a quotient as a consequence

1248.14 --> 1256.3200000000002
what motto no it's a constant well it's

1252.25 --> 1260.32
a holy Taylor designed concept to apply

1256.32 --> 1263.5
gravity to mass if you have including

1260.32 --> 1265.1499999999999
weight it's another nice job based on

1263.5 --> 1268.63
graphs with you that's weights look it

1265.15 --> 1271.8400000000001
up if I don't need to look it up if you

1268.63 --> 1277.21
have wheat if you have matter you have

1271.84 --> 1280.1699999999998
wheat so Martha doesn't weigh anything

1277.21 --> 1282.64
then depends on the scenario it is in

1280.17 --> 1284.41
you what you're telling me I'll bet

1282.64 --> 1288.8500000000001
amount of doesn't weigh in it that's

1284.41 --> 1290.8300000000002
right matter is in freefall there's not

1288.85 --> 1294.58
gonna weigh the same thing because

1290.83 --> 1299.1899999999998
weight is relative it's a concept I have

1294.58 --> 1304.35
said wheat is a consequence of madam

1299.19 --> 1307.8400000000001
yeah that's not that's just incorrect

1304.35 --> 1310.6
well of course is it's not incorrect

1307.84 --> 1313.12
it's free isn't it no it's not much no

1310.6 --> 1315.1899999999998
if you didn't have matter you're missing

1313.12 --> 1317.4399999999998
something you're missing he didn't have

1315.19 --> 1320.29
matter you wouldn't have wheat you're

1317.44 --> 1323.43
asking something though no if you didn't

1320.29 --> 1327.37
have matter you would not have wheat

1323.43 --> 1329.41
exactly there is no way to confirm that

1327.37 --> 1335.4699999999998
because we have no proof of

1329.41 --> 1336.7900000000002
nonmatter existing see that is not true

1335.47 --> 1339.1000000000001
see that they'll that wasn't even Lance

1336.79 --> 1340.6299999999999
enough that is an answer yes that was

1339.1 --> 1341.5
like that was like being on steve

1340.63 --> 1344.3500000000001
McMissile

1341.5 --> 1348.4
no it's technically literally true

1344.35 --> 1350.8899999999999
don't be get pedantic with me okay no no

1348.4 --> 1353.17
I'm okay I'm not getting pedantic I'm

1350.89 --> 1355.42
seeing you you avoided you avoided

1353.17 --> 1358.1200000000001
something you can't you can't get wheat

1355.42 --> 1361.18
without matter therefore green is a

1358.12 --> 1363.2199999999998
consequence of matter it's not a

1361.18 --> 1366.01
consequence of matter it's a consequence

1363.22 --> 1370.0
of a combination you're completely

1366.01 --> 1373.66
missing out it is wait is it is a

1370.0 --> 1377.47
concept based on when forces are applied

1373.66 --> 1379.78
to matter and then weight can be

1377.47 --> 1383.17
registered it's just a way to measure

1379.78 --> 1386.11
that's force being applied and in the

1383.17 --> 1388.99
natural state without external forces

1386.11 --> 1391.12
applying then yeah there is also weight

1388.99 --> 1393.04
measurable but we can ascribe this to a

1391.12 --> 1395.1699999999998
relative density which is approvable

1393.04 --> 1400.8
concept where the force can actually be

1395.17 --> 1403.63
traced and varied I manipulated so yeah

1400.8 --> 1405.34
okay well well I created that for then

1403.63 --> 1406.66
I've got my own theory but you me tell

1405.34 --> 1411.22
you to in you've got yours in the

1406.66 --> 1414.5800000000002
mainstream well I try to not make it my

1411.22 --> 1417.34
theory but like literal scientific fact

1414.58 --> 1419.9499999999998
as much as I can and if I can't then I

1417.34 --> 1424.0
will say exactly on what level it is

1419.95 --> 1426.19
evidence so in this case no this but

1424.0 --> 1428.77
that's maybe the force within it all its

1426.19 --> 1431.17
that is real so you can't prove my

1428.77 --> 1435.79
theory wrong because you can't prove you

1431.17 --> 1440.6200000000001
need you need a tensor of course for an

1435.79 --> 1444.1
object to fall so ma ma ma theory can't

1440.62 --> 1447.4899999999998
be proven wrong so but it doesn't need

1444.1 --> 1448.75
to be external it can be internal yeah

1447.49 --> 1450.76
then you're going into the male physique

1448.75 --> 1453.04
wall and then you're beginning no in

1450.76 --> 1456.01
your so it's not metaphysical I'm not

1453.04 --> 1459.04
asking for the cause of relative density

1456.01 --> 1462.52
for a fact I'm just establishing it is a

1459.04 --> 1464.74
forced effect that is provably there

1462.52 --> 1468.82
really sick of this discussion with you

1464.74 --> 1472.75
man was your here's twirling around this

1468.82 --> 1474.7
for no damn reason no just try to get

1472.75 --> 1476.8
cloudy I'm giving you my opinion

1474.7 --> 1480.76
I'm just seeing it's not very clear

1476.8 --> 1483.22
you're making weird statements just what

1480.76 --> 1485.44
the week is a consequence of motto yeah

1483.22 --> 1487.3
it's not it's not just the consequence

1485.44 --> 1490.0900000000001
of matter you're you're ruling out a

1487.3 --> 1493.27
very critical factor that is before yeah

1490.09 --> 1496.1399999999999
your gravy your Gaddafi no not gravity a

1493.27 --> 1499.69
force applying it is ascribe to gravity

1496.14 --> 1501.97
standardized but it's for supplying and

1499.69 --> 1503.98
that force is then assumed to be gravity

1501.97 --> 1507.34
in a stationary situation that's how

1503.98 --> 1508.18
they conceptualize it yeah well that's

1507.34 --> 1510.1299999999999
not how I do it

1508.18 --> 1514.63
that's not how I do it either not

1510.13 --> 1518.68
anymore anyway I ascribe like - wrong is

1514.63 --> 1521.7700000000002
a-- what so your theories roll it right

1518.68 --> 1524.8
and yours is the absolute roman it is

1521.77 --> 1528.1299999999999
the most correct and scientifically

1524.8 --> 1530.32
founded theory dealing with this concept

1528.13 --> 1533.0500000000002
that i can conceptualize and explain at

1530.32 --> 1535.3899999999999
the moment yes that's correct not saying

1533.05 --> 1537.7
it is not a final answer but it is for

1535.39 --> 1541.8700000000001
now it's the best time is the science

1537.7 --> 1547.77
piece I understand his beast more really

1541.87 --> 1552.1599999999999
what's your independent variable of all

1547.77 --> 1555.43
for here science because I base my my

1552.16 --> 1557.65
evidence my scientific evidence on the

1555.43 --> 1559.99
relative density which is provable can

1557.65 --> 1562.0300000000002
be demonstrated very they manipulated

1559.99 --> 1564.1
the relative density will find its

1562.03 --> 1566.3799999999999
equilibrium and can all be their market

1564.1 --> 1571.81
right anyways and the force can be

1566.38 --> 1573.67
proven main is you see that's my last

1571.81 --> 1575.59
might have been really supportive the

1573.67 --> 1578.65
lots for your theory except for make a

1575.59 --> 1582.6999999999998
few statements and I'm seeing the

1578.65 --> 1585.64
dancing I'm seeing the weight is a

1582.7 --> 1588.06
consequence of matter without matter you

1585.64 --> 1591.25
won't have reached fine

1588.06 --> 1596.06
well that's logic to me that's good

1591.25 --> 1599.36
nice really cool so yeah

1596.06 --> 1601.4299999999998
I'll just not deny that even though I

1599.36 --> 1604.52
see lots of problems with it in the

1601.43 --> 1609.1000000000001
wider scale but sure sure where there is

1604.52 --> 1612.65
matter involved there can be weight and

1609.1 --> 1614.6299999999999
sure why not but the problem is you

1612.65 --> 1617.24
can't disprove it because she cannot

1614.63 --> 1619.16
measure things not matter that's the

1617.24 --> 1624.23
whole problem you can disprove it

1619.16 --> 1626.1200000000001
so it's unfair fireable well it's like

1624.23 --> 1626.66
it's like your theory a gravity then

1626.12 --> 1629.81
isn't it

1626.66 --> 1632.96
I have no theory of gravity I just know

1629.81 --> 1635.6599999999999
our gravity is and what it is not I

1632.96 --> 1639.5
ascribe the aberrations the effects of

1635.66 --> 1642.2
the suggestive nature of why people

1639.5 --> 1644.66
would believe in gravity because of all

1642.2 --> 1647.3600000000001
the aberrations combined I do not

1644.66 --> 1649.3100000000002
recognize it to be real it's an

1647.36 --> 1651.5
aberration I don't have a theory on

1649.31 --> 1654.77
gravity because I don't think it's real

1651.5 --> 1657.74
I think it's an aberration and I have a

1654.77 --> 1660.47
theory about why it is an aberration but

1657.74 --> 1662.33
I don't have a theory on gravity as a

1660.47 --> 1667.99
real thing because I don't think it is

1662.33 --> 1670.1299999999999
real I just know how the system works

1667.99 --> 1672.71
that's all well I'm glad you at least

1670.13 --> 1674.93
lesson and to like you I appreciate the

1672.71 --> 1678.41
unit all right yeah well this is good

1674.93 --> 1680.3
let's round it off anyway I gotta I

1678.41 --> 1685.91
gotta get some lunch I'm getting really

1680.3 --> 1691.58
ass right so I'm gonna round out the

1685.91 --> 1693.6200000000001
show thanks Ali B and n methi Matthias

1691.58 --> 1697.8799999999999
thank you very much for coming on the

1693.62 --> 1699.7099999999998
panel on the open panel today yeah I'll

1697.88 --> 1701.96
be back tomorrow by the way with another

1699.71 --> 1704.8400000000001
open panel show if you'd like to come

1701.96 --> 1706.6100000000001
back that would be great or anyone else

1704.84 --> 1708.5
that would like to join would also be

all right see you guys again Marcus

1723.52 --> 1729.23
so yeah that was pretty interesting

1726.669 --> 1731.5700000000002
gravity talk got a little annoyed here

1729.23 --> 1734.179
and there but I'm to happen at some

1731.57 --> 1738.32
point but to be rounded out in a good

1734.179 --> 1740.15
way I think pretty much agreeing what to

1738.32 --> 1742.3999999999999
agree on and what to disagree on

1740.15 --> 1745.01
even though seemingly who we were

1742.4 --> 1747.429
getting in each other's way now right

1745.01 --> 1750.2
hashtag MIFA let's not forget that one

1747.429 --> 1755.71
Thank You Obama Co for always reminding

probably gonna be on glutton

1805.19 --> 1813.049
