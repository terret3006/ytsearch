hot it's a very warm

96.159 --> 102.96000000000001
sunny day it's a bit of

99.2 --> 103.92
moist in the air making it extra warm

102.96 --> 109.119
and there's just

103.92 --> 113.36
no wind so yeah with the sun

109.119 --> 115.84
hitting my room currently it's quite odd

113.36 --> 115.84
in here

122.64 --> 132.879
no trails to be seen out there

128.72 --> 132.879
but it is slightly hazy

140.84 --> 143.84
right

144.959 --> 151.64000000000001
so it's

148.48 --> 157.83999999999997

rand m2 second

166.64 --> 171.83999999999997
it's exactly like yesterday

172.56 --> 185.84
green tea here

186.319 --> 189.11999999999998
it is warm

194.959 --> 202.0
so [ __ ] i just realized that maybe

199.12 --> 204.239
hot tea is not the best type of drink

202.0 --> 207.12
when it's this warm

204.239 --> 207.12
it is what it is

210.799 --> 216.31900000000002
man hey hello agm good to see you in

214.0 --> 216.319
chat

218.0 --> 223.28
so yeah yesterday was quite a eventful

220.959 --> 223.28
day

224.159 --> 231.2
was for me anyway i uh

228.799 --> 233.519
yeah a flat earth early bird show of

231.2 --> 233.51899999999998
course

233.76 --> 237.28
it's good enough i didn't watch it back

235.92 --> 240.55999999999997
this time

237.28 --> 244.159
uh yeah earth debate i was

240.56 --> 247.84
barely active there like really

244.159 --> 250.07999999999998
barely i think i at the start of it

247.84 --> 251.76
asked yeah got involved in the

250.08 --> 253.84
housekeeping questions and then i kind

251.76 --> 257.12
of dropped off because i started cooking

253.84 --> 257.12
dinner as i said i would

257.28 --> 263.28
and yeah that turned out to be

260.639 --> 264.8
really good so yeah i'm very happy with

263.28 --> 269.84
that

264.8 --> 269.84000000000003
very elaborate very tasty

270.88 --> 277.44
dinner that i had with my

274.32 --> 277.919
roommate and we also during dinner had

277.44 --> 282.0
just

277.919 --> 285.03999999999996
good conversation and good laughs about

282.0 --> 285.04
yeah i don't know

285.52 --> 288.96
about having dinner i guess uh with the

288.4 --> 292.4
family

288.96 --> 292.4
and what that's like

293.52 --> 300.0
going through old times this is

296.88 --> 302.639
because yeah try and do that right now

300.0 --> 303.12
but anyway yeah the it was very spicy it

302.639 --> 307.039
was

303.12 --> 307.039
like indonesian style so it was

307.12 --> 315.039
ginger explosion and

311.52 --> 318.24
a lot of sambal

315.039 --> 321.84
a lot of hot stuff in there as well in a

318.24 --> 325.199
separate thing with

321.84 --> 328.32
beans no wait how do you call that

325.199 --> 328.32
the green long things

332.56 --> 338.72
never been too good at separating the

336.24 --> 342.40000000000003
dutch names for food

338.72 --> 342.40000000000003
and vegetables with the english

343.22 --> 346.23900000000003
[Music]

348.16 --> 356.639
green beans right it's just great

353.6 --> 359.36
huh so but that was good also had the

356.639 --> 359.36
opportunity

359.44 --> 364.88
to basically confront the guy again very

362.72 --> 365.91900000000004
carefully and it seemed like he was

364.88 --> 369.12
prepared and

365.919 --> 369.12
halfway open to it

369.759 --> 373.199
but eventually when i started to

372.08 --> 376.479
basically

373.199 --> 380.0
press him on the

376.479 --> 383.919
uh well the vaccine because kind of like

380.0 --> 383.919
i was going to talk about that

384.0 --> 390.8
right and he he knew it but

387.52 --> 395.84
yeah i did basically identified why

390.8 --> 395.84000000000003
he did his things and it seems like he's

396.88 --> 401.28
i don't know maybe it's it's personal

403.36 --> 409.52000000000004
but he's kind of built this

407.52 --> 412.0
image for himself where he kind of like

409.52 --> 413.039
trusts god and is just not gonna worry

412.0 --> 415.44
about it

413.039 --> 416.8
it's just it's a it's a simple mechanism

415.44 --> 418.88
and i recognize it

416.8 --> 420.72
it's just very dangerous in these times

418.88 --> 422.71999999999997
and i i tried to explain it to him

420.72 --> 425.759
without ripping him out of it because he

422.72 --> 425.759
obviously had it

426.08 --> 431.12
as a defense mechanism to get around in

428.639 --> 431.12
his life

431.599 --> 436.24
but as soon as i basically started

434.0 --> 438.4
lifting the details

436.24 --> 440.479
about the vaccine how it's not actually

438.4 --> 442.31899999999996
a vaccine and it's a gene therapy that's

440.479 --> 444.15999999999997
when he kind of freaked out

442.319 --> 446.40000000000003
and asked to change the conversation

444.16 --> 449.52000000000004
which i obliged immediately

446.4 --> 452.0
because i'm not there to to mentally

449.52 --> 455.84
torture him i just had to try it

452.0 --> 459.44
and i'll hope that he remembers it also

455.84 --> 460.63899999999995
giving him the analogy that i did very

459.44 --> 466.0
roughly

460.639 --> 466.0
about god giving you three warnings

466.96 --> 471.68
so you're in trouble you ask for god to

469.84 --> 474.08
save you

471.68 --> 474.8
somebody comes by offers you help and

474.08 --> 477.75899999999996
say no

474.8 --> 479.039
god's gonna save me that story i

477.759 --> 482.08000000000004
basically laid it out

479.039 --> 484.96
very simple just like that as in like

482.08 --> 487.19899999999996
i'm trying to warn you but it's up to

484.96 --> 487.19899999999996
you

487.599 --> 493.28
and i think that i did actually like

490.879 --> 494.879
it did click somehow it's just i think

493.28 --> 496.63899999999995
he doesn't really know how to deal with

494.879 --> 498.40000000000003
it yet

496.639 --> 500.96000000000004
but at least he got the warning just

498.4 --> 504.0
don't do it again

500.96 --> 507.12
it seems like there's very little

504.0 --> 507.44
direct consequences of him taking the

507.12 --> 511.199
shot

507.44 --> 514.399
which i'm very happy about for him but

511.199 --> 517.44
yeah just don't do it again

514.399 --> 520.8
so yeah good

517.44 --> 524.08
good dinner good talk heartfelt and

520.8 --> 526.4799999999999
also just i kind of like he did offer me

524.08 --> 528.08
the room to completely be my pretty

526.48 --> 531.2
intense self

528.08 --> 534.32
and i even laid out some

531.2 --> 537.279
the well the more darker things

534.32 --> 539.2
from my past that i normally like never

537.279 --> 542.72
really talk about

539.2 --> 542.72
like on camera or anything

543.04 --> 548.0799999999999
i reference it i just don't really talk

545.76 --> 550.72
about it

548.08 --> 553.279
so to give him a better picture of why

550.72 --> 556.399
i'm under tension

553.279 --> 560.8
in general because of things in the past

556.399 --> 560.8
roughly the mechanics of how i work

561.36 --> 566.88
and i think that he like he does have

563.519 --> 570.9590000000001
the talent to actually grasp it

566.88 --> 570.959
and he's like

571.2 --> 576.0
we even got to the point where he

572.959 --> 579.1199999999999
started to explain himself

576.0 --> 581.04
as he started to pick up how i talk how

579.12 --> 582.0
i explain things and how i basically

581.04 --> 584.24
trust god

582.0 --> 586.08
for my information i don't consider it

584.24 --> 586.72
as mine and he definitely recognized

586.08 --> 590.08
that and

586.72 --> 593.12
had examples of where sometimes he would

590.08 --> 593.9200000000001
just be present in a conversation and

593.12 --> 597.2
then get

593.92 --> 599.36
got hit by sudden

597.2 --> 600.5600000000001
inspiration with mechanical details

599.36 --> 603.6800000000001
where he

600.56 --> 604.0
couldn't really grasp like where did i

603.68 --> 606.959
learn

604.0 --> 609.839
this where did this come from so he has

606.959 --> 609.8389999999999
kind of the same

610.72 --> 615.0400000000001
setup you could say he has the same

613.6 --> 617.279
talent

615.04 --> 619.12
i recognized one of my own talents

617.279 --> 622.24
within him and

619.12 --> 623.279
basically telling him it almost feels

622.24 --> 625.6800000000001
like

623.279 --> 626.959
a wizard approaching a potential student

625.68 --> 632.399
like yeah you could

626.959 --> 636.399
really get serious

632.399 --> 639.6
and maybe turn up the real

636.399 --> 640.64
like the real mission from god and try

639.6 --> 645.839
to help against

640.64 --> 649.1999999999999
this satanic mind control war

645.839 --> 650.24
no so i try to give him as much

649.2 --> 653.12
confidence

650.24 --> 654.88
like like i really see the telling him

653.12 --> 657.279
like you can do it

654.88 --> 658.56
you've been through [ __ ] like he didn't

657.279 --> 660.8
have to say that

658.56 --> 663.5999999999999
just by the way he responds it's just

660.8 --> 666.3199999999999
you know i know

663.6 --> 670.0
somebody going through some dark [ __ ]

666.32 --> 670.0
that they don't know how to deal with

670.64 --> 675.76
you can see that especially if you've

673.92 --> 677.76
been through it yourself you can see

675.76 --> 680.16
that on somebody even if they never talk

677.76 --> 680.16
about it

680.64 --> 685.68
right so yeah pretty intense very

683.76 --> 688.16
arwenian like that

685.68 --> 688.88
but at the same time good dinner very

688.16 --> 691.519
nourishing

688.88 --> 692.72
like ginger explosion and hey that's

691.519 --> 696.24
really good for the body

692.72 --> 698.0790000000001
to do that sometimes also we have plenty

696.24 --> 701.2
of garlic in there

698.079 --> 705.8389999999999
not raw garlic it was cooked and

701.2 --> 709.2
yeah all the pepper like an entire

705.839 --> 712.9590000000001
pot small pot of sambal i don't know

709.2 --> 717.839
what is that in english let me go do the

712.959 --> 720.16
go go translator again

717.839 --> 721.0400000000001
chili sauce it's just cold chili sauce

720.16 --> 723.36
okay

721.04 --> 723.36
this is

724.079 --> 731.8389999999999
right with green beans

732.56 --> 737.92
it's just that i don't know having

735.68 --> 739.519
touched on some indonesian culture and

737.92 --> 739.8389999999999
all that hey which is where this comes

739.519 --> 743.2
from

739.839 --> 744.0790000000001
right they like their peppers so just

743.2 --> 747.519
calling it chili

744.079 --> 750.6389999999999
sauce seems super oversimplified

747.519 --> 754.24
because it's not just chili sauce it's

750.639 --> 757.36
samo it's a specific combination

754.24 --> 761.44
with certain herbs and it's just

757.36 --> 763.6
it's just zombo anyway

761.44 --> 768.24
it was really good half elaborate dinner

763.6 --> 768.24
and intense conversation and i hope

769.2 --> 774.399
is taking the time to think about it and

772.0 --> 776.48
be a little bit more careful

774.399 --> 778.16
like take the mission from god which he

776.48 --> 781.12
did seem to have

778.16 --> 781.6
through his experiences he recognized it

781.12 --> 784.16
that there

781.6 --> 786.16
is basically a creation and a very

784.16 --> 789.04
superficial but spiritual set

786.16 --> 791.04
like sensible level at the same time

789.04 --> 794.16
kind of hidden within

791.04 --> 796.7199999999999
his own safety bubble of just

794.16 --> 798.48
everything has to be good like so he's

796.72 --> 798.9590000000001
kind of blinded to the darkness like

798.48 --> 802.5600000000001
that

798.959 --> 802.56
it's just very dangerous

804.24 --> 808.5600000000001
hopefully his intuition will carry him

806.32 --> 808.5600000000001
through

809.36 --> 819.519
anyway right that happened

814.959 --> 819.5189999999999
uh and after way later

819.68 --> 823.8389999999999
infowars is like completely going nuts

821.839 --> 824.48
about the border like these this last

823.839 --> 830.8800000000001
week

824.48 --> 830.88
like damn dudes piling it all on

832.88 --> 836.079
apparently there's all kinds of things

834.639 --> 836.9590000000001
happening with that over there in the

836.079 --> 842.6389999999999
u.s

836.959 --> 845.5189999999999
at the south right anyway brandon's

842.639 --> 845.519
later man

845.68 --> 849.519
i don't know if anybody picked up on

847.279 --> 849.519
that

849.76 --> 856.079
right by the way let me get back to chat

852.959 --> 860.399
i see there's a whole lot of people

856.079 --> 863.68
talking hello foul on buchanan

860.399 --> 863.68
earth is seriously flat

864.0 --> 868.839
okay there's a meeting teaching the

867.279 --> 871.8389999999999
children

868.839 --> 871.839
okay

873.6 --> 881.519
word of the day is scam damage

876.639 --> 885.839
right anti-covet measure activity

881.519 --> 885.839
that's good

886.56 --> 893.279
ah seeking star water

890.56 --> 898.0
what my warning still is resulting

893.279 --> 901.8389999999999
you're wearing a tin foil

898.0 --> 905.12
right well look seeking

901.839 --> 908.24
you what might help

905.12 --> 910.639
or it might really help is to kind of

908.24 --> 913.199
take these interactions as a

910.639 --> 915.6
multi-layered thing

913.199 --> 916.8
so even if somebody is going to

915.6 --> 920.5600000000001
basically

916.8 --> 921.4399999999999
scold you over telling them something

920.56 --> 925.1199999999999
that they can

921.44 --> 927.519
fit in that moment in their way of going

925.12 --> 930.399
about

927.519 --> 932.5600000000001
you know doesn't mean that they're not

930.399 --> 934.959
gonna think about it you know

932.56 --> 935.8389999999999
me i have a lot of memories of my own

934.959 --> 937.5189999999999
actions

935.839 --> 939.6
especially when i was young when i was

937.519 --> 942.88
young it was like incredible

939.6 --> 942.88
how how much it happened

943.279 --> 947.36
but when somebody reminded me of

945.04 --> 950.0
something that made me feel ashamed

947.36 --> 951.279
of myself for not being able to deal

950.0 --> 953.12
with it or knowing it

951.279 --> 956.0
i would attack the person for that

953.12 --> 958.399
verbally i would try to quickly

956.0 --> 960.8
pretty insidiously sometimes make them

958.399 --> 964.399
feel stupid about themselves

960.8 --> 968.24
and that's just clear-cut ego response

964.399 --> 972.16
right so even

968.24 --> 972.16
even though i did that

980.8 --> 984.24
even though i did that

984.56 --> 990.079
i had learned very young

987.6 --> 991.839
that even though i'm smart and our old

990.079 --> 993.68
people are smart everybody makes

991.839 --> 995.36
mistakes and the only real mistake is

993.68 --> 996.0
when you don't recognize a mistake and

995.36 --> 998.8000000000001
try to correct

996.0 --> 1000.16
it i learned that very young on an

998.8 --> 1002.4799999999999
intuitive level i

1000.16 --> 1004.079
would that was i rammed that into myself

1002.48 --> 1006.399
i recognized it as a

1004.079 --> 1009.04
very important tool when i was like

1006.399 --> 1009.04
really young

1009.12 --> 1015.839
say h5

1012.959 --> 1017.68
and just that that's a part of what i do

1015.839 --> 1018.8000000000001
so even though sometimes i would act

1017.68 --> 1022.0
like that

1018.8 --> 1024.72
get really offended

1022.0 --> 1026.4
and being able to smartly bend it

1024.72 --> 1029.52
towards the person

1026.4 --> 1032.16
that had informed me afterward i would

1029.52 --> 1034.4
always come back

1032.16 --> 1035.52
and kind of like halfway embarrassed say

1034.4 --> 1037.919
it like yeah okay

1035.52 --> 1039.039
yeah yeah actually it was a good point i

1037.919 --> 1041.199
just

1039.039 --> 1042.319
and then lay it out exactly why i

1041.199 --> 1045.76
responded like that

1042.319 --> 1047.28
basically trying to correct myself

1045.76 --> 1051.039
well there's a whole bunch of people

1047.28 --> 1055.44
unfortunately out there also that

1051.039 --> 1055.44
for some reason refuse to do that

1056.4 --> 1060.0800000000002
and then they retain tensions for a very

1059.12 --> 1062.9599999999998
long time

1060.08 --> 1063.9189999999999
sometimes resulting in even psychotic

1062.96 --> 1067.28
level

1063.919 --> 1070.96
social interactions

1067.28 --> 1074.799
one of those people very typical

1070.96 --> 1078.8400000000001
is bob

1074.799 --> 1080.32
so has anybody seen me yesterday over at

1078.84 --> 1083.6
brandon's

1080.32 --> 1088.08
i got in there pretty quickly

1083.6 --> 1091.6789999999999
and then there was a whole complaints

1088.08 --> 1092.559
situation about uh well mostly coming

1091.679 --> 1095.52
from

1092.559 --> 1097.84
mark doxie i recognize this voice

1095.52 --> 1100.24
complaining about

1097.84 --> 1102.3999999999999
about gravity and how we we shouldn't

1100.24 --> 1103.919
even use relative density because it has

1102.4 --> 1105.8400000000001
nothing to do with the shape of the

1103.919 --> 1109.039
earth

1105.84 --> 1109.52
right and later how nathan oakley is a

1109.039 --> 1112.32
cult

1109.52 --> 1114.8799999999999
and i'm a part of that called like even

1112.32 --> 1118.32
though i was right there

1114.88 --> 1122.64
and it got kind of annoying because

1118.32 --> 1126.559
at some point brandon like other people

1122.64 --> 1129.8400000000001
started rolling in like bob nodell

1126.559 --> 1132.6399999999999
right and he he got on he like got

1129.84 --> 1134.6399999999999
he just threw all the garbage right on

1132.64 --> 1137.679
the street just like that

1134.64 --> 1141.679
and then started complaining about me

1137.679 --> 1143.2
always bringing it up when he is the one

1141.679 --> 1147.679
that brings it up like

1143.2 --> 1150.559
every single time i hear him every time

1147.679 --> 1151.52
he brings it up when i did like a show

1150.559 --> 1154.8799999999999
about it

1151.52 --> 1156.96
one time and i pretty much don't even

1154.88 --> 1159.2
talk about it anymore

1156.96 --> 1161.3600000000001
he brings it up every single time it's

1159.2 --> 1165.3600000000001
crazy

1161.36 --> 1167.36
so i had to kind of stay polite

1165.36 --> 1169.6789999999999
as if i'm dealing with a very triggered

1167.36 --> 1172.7199999999998
insane person

1169.679 --> 1174.48
but be true to myself like i no i'm not

1172.72 --> 1176.799
gonna play along and i'm also not gonna

1174.48 --> 1179.28
be gaslit you're not gonna

1176.799 --> 1182.0
use the tension and the grief of the

1179.28 --> 1185.9189999999999
situation that i experienced

1182.0 --> 1189.28
to make me fuzz it up

1185.919 --> 1190.5590000000002
and replace it with your version that is

1189.28 --> 1193.28
a lie

1190.559 --> 1197.28
which he was doing very refined it was

1193.28 --> 1197.28
creepy as [ __ ] really to sit there

1197.36 --> 1200.3999999999999
as he was doing that

1200.88 --> 1207.2
right but anyway even

1204.159 --> 1209.0390000000002
as people attack the crew

1207.2 --> 1210.72
of nathan oakley which i'm a part of

1209.039 --> 1212.64
when i was there

1210.72 --> 1214.159
i didn't really get a lot of chance to

1212.64 --> 1217.039
defend it

1214.159 --> 1221.8400000000001
it's being rumpus a lot and eventually

1217.039 --> 1221.84
brandon even muted me

1222.559 --> 1230.24
like i couldn't insert counter arguments

1225.919 --> 1232.88
apparently so then yeah then i just left

1230.24 --> 1234.24
and i i heard from others that it just

1232.88 --> 1237.5200000000002
kept going on and on

1234.24 --> 1241.039
and on and like jose jg

1237.52 --> 1241.36
and got in there and then mark doxie and

1241.039 --> 1244.48
him

1241.36 --> 1245.039
started to basically publicly whack each

1244.48 --> 1247.3600000000001
other and

1245.039 --> 1249.84
jack each other off it's pretty

1247.36 --> 1249.84
repulsive

1252.559 --> 1256.0
anyway i dropped there but yeah went

1255.2 --> 1259.3600000000001
head-on

1256.0 --> 1262.4
or rather bob just came out of nowhere

1259.36 --> 1266.6399999999999
and like started to throw

1262.4 --> 1266.64
like really bad garbage around

1268.159 --> 1275.3600000000001
and well he did face me in that

1272.159 --> 1278.64
banana ankle state and

1275.36 --> 1280.8799999999999
i think i wow i defended

1278.64 --> 1282.3200000000002
well enough i don't know how how well i

1280.88 --> 1285.2800000000002
was hurt

1282.32 --> 1286.0
though and eventually i even got muted

1285.28 --> 1288.6399999999999
so

1286.0 --> 1290.24
also my internet just disconnected in

1288.64 --> 1295.1200000000001
the middle of it at some point like

1290.24 --> 1295.1200000000001
right perfect timing it's just freaking

1302.84 --> 1305.84
great

1309.36 --> 1314.0
yo i was speaking over brandon no but

1312.159 --> 1315.8400000000001
brandon broke in the middle of a

1314.0 --> 1319.12
conversation

1315.84 --> 1322.1589999999999
right after like two minute personal

1319.12 --> 1322.1589999999999
attack tirade

1322.64 --> 1327.919
and he didn't tell bob to stop

1326.0 --> 1329.679
and he didn't give me a chance to

1327.919 --> 1331.6000000000001
basically rebut that

1329.679 --> 1333.8400000000001
i don't appreciate being treated like

1331.6 --> 1333.84
that

1340.88 --> 1347.8400000000001
so yeah i don't like that brandon did

1342.88 --> 1347.8400000000001
that at all

1348.559 --> 1350.799
so

1352.48 --> 1356.24
like that's pretty disgusting really

1354.559 --> 1359.039
when you think about it

1356.24 --> 1360.799
just letting a person get heavily at

1359.039 --> 1363.76
home attack

1360.799 --> 1364.1589999999999
accused and then basically not allowing

1363.76 --> 1367.12
that

1364.159 --> 1370.0800000000002
to respond and of course i am gonna

1367.12 --> 1371.12
respond because it was i was right there

1370.08 --> 1373.52
pretty much in the middle of a

1371.12 --> 1376.7199999999998
conversation and somebody's just

1373.52 --> 1377.76
almost face to face attacking you and

1376.72 --> 1381.28
then i can

1377.76 --> 1384.1589999999999
then i have to just swallow that and and

1381.28 --> 1384.96
let the conversation calmly go to

1384.159 --> 1388.0
something else

1384.96 --> 1391.28
no that's unreasonable

1388.0 --> 1395.679
right that is

1391.28 --> 1399.12
unreasonable so getting muted

1395.679 --> 1403.2800000000002
at that time is just yeah made me

1399.12 --> 1405.9189999999999
uh doesn't help building respect

1403.28 --> 1406.48
for the way things are going over there

1405.919 --> 1410.7990000000002
but

1406.48 --> 1413.2
despite that yeah it was interesting to

1410.799 --> 1417.84
have that head-on confrontation with bob

1413.2 --> 1417.8400000000001
and him accusing me

1418.08 --> 1423.279
and and also in his way just laying it

1421.039 --> 1423.6
out on the table like he basically said

1423.279 --> 1427.039
no

1423.6 --> 1430.48
no i i disclaimed it's all

1427.039 --> 1432.799
just conceptual like i was

1430.48 --> 1434.64
defaulting it just getting you know and

1432.799 --> 1436.1589999999999
i told him like yeah that doesn't really

1434.64 --> 1440.0
matter

1436.159 --> 1440.0
certain things should not be said

1440.559 --> 1444.72
like doesn't matter if it's hypothetical

1442.4 --> 1448.159
there's some things you just don't say

1444.72 --> 1451.679
and if you do that's

1448.159 --> 1455.2
that's just bad that's pretty much it

1451.679 --> 1457.2
that that's i i didn't i didn't even go

1455.2 --> 1472.96
beyond that but he was just

1457.2 --> 1487.8400000000001
totally going nuts over it

1472.96 --> 1487.8400000000001
what are you on about

1489.2 --> 1493.279
i don't know who asked me three times to

1491.52 --> 1497.039
wait i didn't

1493.279 --> 1497.039
i could i don't know what you're talking

1497.17 --> 1501.8400000000001
[Music]

1498.84 --> 1501.84
about

1502.96 --> 1529.8400000000001
oh god

1515.76 --> 1529.84
it's just a great time for that

1547.039 --> 1550.799
well mazar slim could be that brandon

1549.36 --> 1553.12
said that

1550.799 --> 1554.48
it didn't come through also i was kind

1553.12 --> 1556.8799999999999
of locked into

1554.48 --> 1559.039
responding so yeah when i'm locked into

1556.88 --> 1561.8400000000001
a serious response

1559.039 --> 1562.64
i don't really listen to other people

1561.84 --> 1565.6789999999999
talking

1562.64 --> 1565.679
through me

1566.24 --> 1572.799
all right mazar saleem so

1569.52 --> 1575.039
yeah it could be that he did that sure

1572.799 --> 1576.08
it's just unreasonable that he did that

1575.039 --> 1579.76
i was

1576.08 --> 1583.12
basically being attacked and responding

1579.76 --> 1583.12
and then i'm the batman

1583.2 --> 1585.3600000000001
no

1590.159 --> 1592.88
right anyway

1597.6 --> 1602.799
overall i brought it up again today

1599.52 --> 1605.36
because it is an interesting situation

1602.799 --> 1608.1589999999999
i'm yeah i didn't really lose any sleep

1605.36 --> 1608.1589999999999
over this okay

1610.64 --> 1613.919
it's not the first time i'm being

1612.08 --> 1616.48
treated like this it's just that

1613.919 --> 1618.3200000000002
to me this is a clear cut sign like okay

1616.48 --> 1621.6
that's

1618.32 --> 1623.84
corruption it's not like financial or

1621.6 --> 1625.1999999999998
contractual it's just personal

1623.84 --> 1628.72
corruption and hey

1625.2 --> 1630.0800000000002
jose is that that's jose is like the

1628.72 --> 1634.72
worst with this [ __ ]

1630.08 --> 1637.36
it's only grown worse so

1634.72 --> 1638.559
it just it's very telling as to the

1637.36 --> 1641.84
level

1638.559 --> 1641.84
of what's going on in there

1647.52 --> 1653.44
right so yeah i don't know man i thought

1650.64 --> 1654.3200000000002
maybe it has it's it depends on who is

1653.44 --> 1658.0
there

1654.32 --> 1658.0
but this time it was just

1658.159 --> 1661.919
level was kind of shitty

1664.96 --> 1669.44
some other times it can be kind of

1667.12 --> 1672.9599999999998
interesting

1669.44 --> 1683.8400000000001
so i guess it depends on who's gonna

1672.96 --> 1683.8400000000001
crash in there

1686.96 --> 1691.76
right but yeah for the record

1691.84 --> 1698.399
every time bob

1695.44 --> 1699.279
brought up like i it's not even every

1698.399 --> 1701.4399999999998
time just

1699.279 --> 1702.399
bob was the one constantly bringing that

1701.44 --> 1704.72
[ __ ] up

1702.399 --> 1704.7199999999998
right

1705.6 --> 1708.6399999999999
samson's video

1709.44 --> 1713.8400000000001
and he literally put it on the table and

1712.0 --> 1715.12
i dealt with it as it was put on the

1713.84 --> 1717.9189999999999
table but

1715.12 --> 1718.1589999999999
i never brought it up i never bring it

1717.919 --> 1720.88
up

1718.159 --> 1722.159
i don't want to bring it up i'm repulsed

1720.88 --> 1725.2
by it

1722.159 --> 1729.3600000000001
but i'm not gonna forget

1725.2 --> 1729.3600000000001
and he just constantly brings it up

1730.72 --> 1739.84
right doesn't he constantly bring it up

1751.44 --> 1756.24
oh no mother salima didn't catch that

1754.399 --> 1759.36
was that happening later

1756.24 --> 1761.679
look after i got muted i kind of got out

1759.36 --> 1761.6789999999999
of there

1762.0 --> 1765.279
so and i think the the show still went

1764.159 --> 1769.0390000000002
on for like

1765.279 --> 1769.039
at least another hour after that

1769.6 --> 1774.08
but i wasn't really scouring for data if

1772.88 --> 1777.3600000000001
you know what i mean i was

1774.08 --> 1780.6399999999999
pretty much just there

1777.36 --> 1783.76
trying to form a decent counterweight

1780.64 --> 1787.679
against the accusations of

1783.76 --> 1787.679
the group that i am a part of

1789.76 --> 1794.399
all right now yeah master selena i

1792.0 --> 1809.84
didn't pick up on that i haven't seen

1794.399 --> 1809.84
i didn't really watch after that

1815.52 --> 1827.679
all right

1823.2 --> 1827.679
anyway yeah overall pretty intense day

1828.159 --> 1837.8400000000001
but still good

1838.24 --> 1841.52
managed to not go to bed as incredibly

1840.799 --> 1844.799
late as

1841.52 --> 1848.32
last last time so i also had a

1844.799 --> 1852.08
better sleep and it's hot

1848.32 --> 1852.08
so i'm very happy that i did that

1858.64 --> 1865.8400000000001
hello one big pond

1866.48 --> 1870.799
so what have you guys and girls been up

1876.84 --> 1879.84
to

1891.6 --> 1894.32
oh and

1899.679 --> 1907.8400000000001
what who whose leg

1902.88 --> 1907.8400000000001
got healed what

1918.84 --> 1924.24
hmm

1920.559 --> 1924.8799999999999
oh why thank you if that's directed at

1924.24 --> 1935.84
me

1924.88 --> 1935.8400000000001
one big pun

1938.799 --> 1942.8799999999999
huh all right em well you you're not the

1941.76 --> 1946.399
only one because

1942.88 --> 1949.1200000000001
there's just gardening work out there

1946.399 --> 1951.12
as well and oh god the sound is really

1949.12 --> 1963.84
annoying

1951.12 --> 1963.84
but i'll live with it

1969.039 --> 1973.039
all right wakey wakey broke it's like

1974.84 --> 1977.84
okay

1980.28 --> 1983.609
[Applause]

1991.679 --> 1995.519
he healed it himself all right

2000.78 --> 2005.84
[Applause]

2002.84 --> 2005.84
interesting

2020.88 --> 2033.8400000000001
any fe talk well sure

2024.0 --> 2033.84
i'm fine with that

2059.949 --> 2063.199
[Applause]

2086.839 --> 2089.839
hmm

2099.04 --> 2105.119
right george sanford

2103.04 --> 2106.72
what do i think causes pressure

2105.119 --> 2110.6400000000003
gradients

2106.72 --> 2110.64
gradients or the gradient

2111.359 --> 2114.7999999999997
well i think that what i suspect the

2114.32 --> 2119.04
most

2114.8 --> 2123.44
is that it is a constant temperature

2119.04 --> 2126.4
influence like i think that the the

2123.44 --> 2127.119
pressure differentials are caused by the

2126.4 --> 2130.48
different

2127.119 --> 2132.48
states of temperature

2130.48 --> 2135.28
so i think it's really cold up there it

2132.48 --> 2139.119
has a cooling influence

2135.28 --> 2141.599
and it's warm periodically down here

2139.119 --> 2142.56
and on average just a lot warmer and

2141.599 --> 2146.4
that's why there

2142.56 --> 2148.48
is more pressure down below

2146.4 --> 2150.88
so i think that it is in the end within

2148.48 --> 2154.16
the closed container it's the heat

2150.88 --> 2154.1600000000003
that causes the pressure

2155.2 --> 2159.839
down below

2184.96 --> 2201.839
what uh okay mr salim what

2206.079 --> 2211.44
sound how does that work super straight

2209.04 --> 2213.44
earther

2211.44 --> 2215.839
what does sound have to do with any of

2213.44 --> 2215.839
it

2219.839 --> 2223.599
for sure sound is just secondary to the

2222.32 --> 2225.599
material

2223.599 --> 2229.839
that are present you know it's it's a

2225.599 --> 2229.839
wave in the material

2245.86 --> 2249.01
[Music]

2268.839 --> 2271.839
hmm

2279.44 --> 2286.0
cool well hey look the

2283.28 --> 2288.32
waiki heal this leg and all that that's

2286.0 --> 2291.44
pretty cool

2288.32 --> 2295.599
does anybody have a link to it

2291.44 --> 2295.599
if you got a wrench you can put it in

2296.839 --> 2302.96
here

2299.2 --> 2302.96
sound and yeah but that's

2306.16 --> 2311.52
hmm well

2309.28 --> 2315.599
sound can do it through cymatics but

2311.52 --> 2315.599
that has to be a constant sound then

2322.079 --> 2325.28
you know just because it can doesn't

2323.839 --> 2329.839
mean that that is

2325.28 --> 2329.8390000000004
the gradiating influence in the realm

2330.96 --> 2334.56
yeah look it up now i've heard of it

2332.72 --> 2337.2
before the way you said it

2334.56 --> 2337.2
reminds me

2337.839 --> 2341.92
that that can cause gradation it doesn't

2341.119 --> 2355.839
mean that that

2341.92 --> 2355.839
is the gradient influence

2356.56 --> 2360.0
uh wait

2360.079 --> 2365.3590000000004
the gyro you're you're talking about

2365.52 --> 2369.839
the ring laser gyroscope right master

2380.839 --> 2383.839
slim

2391.68 --> 2400.8799999999997
right what is causing that uh

2397.359 --> 2403.92
the most simple way of describing it

2400.88 --> 2407.28
but it would be incorrect technically is

2403.92 --> 2407.28
the ether rotation

2408.4 --> 2415.44
there is perhaps a light

2411.8 --> 2418.0
influencing effect

2415.44 --> 2419.68
that causes light to rotate and maybe it

2418.0 --> 2421.839
has an influence on the

2419.68 --> 2423.5989999999997
holographic light manifestations of the

2421.839 --> 2426.88
globe of the heavens as well

2423.599 --> 2429.8
in a sense but

2426.88 --> 2431.599
that's just a very superficial

2429.8 --> 2434.6800000000003
correlatory grab

2431.599 --> 2438.1600000000003
basically as to this

2434.68 --> 2440.64
non-natural phenomenon because it is

2438.16 --> 2441.44
conjured in a device that is man-made

2440.64 --> 2444.72
you will never

2441.44 --> 2444.7200000000003
find that

2445.599 --> 2449.839
that phenomenon in nature right that's a

2448.56 --> 2453.2
bit of an issue

2449.839 --> 2455.2799999999997
but it is interesting

2453.2 --> 2457.9199999999996
right but it's not earth rotating

2455.28 --> 2460.3190000000004
because it's not a physical gyroscope

2457.92 --> 2464.0
it's not mechanical it's light based

2460.319 --> 2464.0
it's a ring laser gyroscope

2465.359 --> 2473.119
so it's definitely not coriolis effect

2469.119 --> 2476.4
that is causing the ring laser gyroscope

2473.119 --> 2476.4
to deviate like it did

2477.04 --> 2481.599
also yet the positioning would be an

2479.839 --> 2482.96
issue

2481.599 --> 2486.7200000000003
you know because if you're going to

2482.96 --> 2486.7200000000003
presume the earth is a sphere

2487.04 --> 2494.24
then the exact rotation should be

2490.4 --> 2497.28
directly showing

2494.24 --> 2498.8799999999997
um yeah in relation to where you are on

2497.28 --> 2500.5600000000004
the presupposed globe

2498.88 --> 2502.319
you know the rotation should be very

2500.56 --> 2504.88
specific and not just

2502.319 --> 2509.04
an axis straight up that it's rotating

2504.88 --> 2512.48
just in place where you stand

2509.04 --> 2515.2
that can't be coriolis deviation

2512.48 --> 2517.119
and hey if one thing is coriolis

2515.2 --> 2519.52
deviating like that because the earth is

2517.119 --> 2521.76
a ball spinning underneath it

2519.52 --> 2523.7599999999998
then everything should a physical

2521.76 --> 2525.6800000000003
gyroscope should too

2523.76 --> 2527.76
so it's not a proof that the earth is

2525.68 --> 2529.5989999999997
spinning

2527.76 --> 2532.079
now what is causing the ring laser

2529.599 --> 2534.7200000000003
gyroscope to deviate like it does

2532.079 --> 2536.7200000000003
i don't know it is an interesting

2534.72 --> 2539.359
phenomenon it's just not a natural

2536.72 --> 2539.359
phenomenon

2542.4 --> 2546.56
but it is an interesting thing to ponder

2548.839 --> 2551.839
on

2562.839 --> 2565.839
huh

2569.839 --> 2574.0789999999997
right yes super straight earther i've

2571.44 --> 2574.079
heard of that

2576.24 --> 2593.839
like they use very specific sound pulses

2581.2 --> 2593.839
that just carry incredibly far

2602.56 --> 2609.68
yeah mother so you may agree

2606.8 --> 2610.7200000000003
but it's definitely not measuring earth

2609.68 --> 2612.56
turn

2610.72 --> 2614.56
because if it were a measuring earth

2612.56 --> 2616.56
turn that means it would be coriolis

2614.56 --> 2619.119
deviation and then everything

2616.56 --> 2619.599
would be deviating just like that not

2619.119 --> 2635.839
just

2619.599 --> 2635.839
only the ring laser gyroscope

2650.31 --> 2656.88
[Music]

2652.24 --> 2660.3999999999996
okay hello oki

2656.88 --> 2662.4
oki asks temp temperature is the cause

2660.4 --> 2665.6800000000003
of atmospheric

2662.4 --> 2667.119
well just gas pressure gradient how does

2665.68 --> 2671.5989999999997
that work

2667.119 --> 2675.599
well it has been demonstrated

2671.599 --> 2678.88
that if you take a a gas

2675.599 --> 2682.6400000000003
a tank a cut-off space

2678.88 --> 2686.4
with gas in it and you put heat

2682.64 --> 2689.7599999999998
and cooling heating and cooling elements

2686.4 --> 2692.96
on both sides of this tank

2689.76 --> 2695.119
that's close closed system then yeah the

2692.96 --> 2698.48
cooling and heating influences will go

2695.119 --> 2700.319
straight straight through the tank

2698.48 --> 2701.839
even though the gas cannot move through

2700.319 --> 2704.88
it and affect

2701.839 --> 2706.0
the gas locally in those locations and

2704.88 --> 2709.2000000000003
they will respond

2706.0 --> 2711.68
exactly as to how temperature make

2709.2 --> 2713.2799999999997
the temperature temperature shift will

2711.68 --> 2715.68
make them respond

2713.28 --> 2718.1600000000003
so if it's cooling it will actually

2715.68 --> 2721.359
retract in place

2718.16 --> 2723.359
and decrease in pressure and then

2721.359 --> 2724.7999999999997
through the second law of thermodynamics

2723.359 --> 2728.64
the heat basically

2724.8 --> 2728.6400000000003
migrates through the whole thing

2729.839 --> 2734.24
right the heat comes and kind of evens

2732.48 --> 2736.319
it out but if there's a constant cooling

2734.24 --> 2739.1189999999997
influences then it will just be

2736.319 --> 2741.2799999999997
cooled again on the other side the heat

2739.119 --> 2743.76
does the same thing exact

2741.28 --> 2747.2000000000003
except the opposite it actually causes

2743.76 --> 2750.8
gas to expand and then

2747.2 --> 2752.8799999999997
the pressure there is locally it kind of

2750.8 --> 2754.4
shifts that's why there is hot air

2752.88 --> 2757.04
rising always

2754.4 --> 2761.6800000000003
no when there's heat in the daytime the

2757.04 --> 2765.599
air rises

2761.68 --> 2768.7999999999997
because it's heating up it's expanding

2765.599 --> 2768.8
the gas is expanding

2770.24 --> 2773.7599999999998
so if there's this constant heat

2772.0 --> 2775.599
influence

2773.76 --> 2777.119
and hey even during the evening if it

2775.599 --> 2780.1600000000003
has been warm and hot

2777.119 --> 2782.48
then the ground still it has a lot of

2780.16 --> 2783.68
yeah heat absorbed into it especially

2782.48 --> 2785.92
rocks

2783.68 --> 2786.72
and they will still give off that heat

2785.92 --> 2789.839
to the air

2786.72 --> 2789.839
for a while

2791.839 --> 2795.839
what about pressure gradients in the

2794.88 --> 2798.8
ocean well

2795.839 --> 2800.839
the pressure gradient in the ocean has

2798.8 --> 2803.8390000000004
to do

2800.839 --> 2803.839
with

2804.079 --> 2807.76
pressure gradient in the ocean well

2809.2 --> 2819.04
yeah how do you explain that is it the

2816.4 --> 2819.04
same effect

2819.119 --> 2824.079
not really well it heat and cold might

2822.48 --> 2825.52
have an influence especially in the

2824.079 --> 2827.92
ocean bottom it's going to be a lot

2825.52 --> 2827.92
cooler

2829.119 --> 2837.599
so the same influences might have effect

2832.8 --> 2837.599
in another setup but

2838.079 --> 2843.6800000000003
yeah it's just also just the pressure

2841.28 --> 2845.599
or as they say the weight of the whole

2843.68 --> 2848.7999999999997
thing

2845.599 --> 2848.8
on whatever's down there

2850.16 --> 2859.839
sound waves what

2884.0 --> 2887.839
uh what

2888.079 --> 2895.04
super straight earther you're

2891.359 --> 2895.04
i think you're mixing up two different

2898.839 --> 2901.839
things

2926.839 --> 2929.839
huh

2946.24 --> 2949.839
yeah that that might be true super

2948.319 --> 2951.68
straight after but

2949.839 --> 2954.319
doesn't really matter whether our

2951.68 --> 2956.5589999999997
hearing picks it up

2954.319 --> 2957.839
it has to be measurable and it has to

2956.559 --> 2961.2000000000003
correlate

2957.839 --> 2965.359
at least for starters

2961.2 --> 2968.8799999999997
with what's out there you know

2965.359 --> 2970.7999999999997
like influences like sound or

2968.88 --> 2972.4
any kind of electrical influences if

2970.8 --> 2974.88
they're supposed to be the cause of

2972.4 --> 2974.88
something

2976.96 --> 2981.04
it has to actually be in the range of

2980.079 --> 2983.92
what

2981.04 --> 2985.52
that effect can do it has to have that

2983.92 --> 2988.64
strength

2985.52 --> 2991.839
with all the consequences of it so if

2988.64 --> 2993.1189999999997
sound is indeed as you suggest causing a

2991.839 --> 2995.599
gradient

2993.119 --> 2997.119
then it would have to be enough sound

2995.599 --> 3001.52
measurable

2997.119 --> 3005.44
in order to bring that state about

3001.52 --> 3005.44
and if our ears can even pick it up

3007.76 --> 3017.3590000000004
then it's not very strong

3013.76 --> 3019.119
and hey cymatics like cymatic shifting

3017.359 --> 3021.04
and all that pressure

3019.119 --> 3024.2400000000002
rearranging through cymatics through

3021.04 --> 3028.96
sound yeah that's pretty loud stuff okay

3024.24 --> 3031.1189999999997
and that's just on a small scale so

3028.96 --> 3034.8
i think you're overestimating the

3031.119 --> 3034.8
ability of cymatics

3036.88 --> 3055.839
you can't have subsonic cymatics that

3039.76 --> 3055.8390000000004
doesn't make any sense

3067.28 --> 3072.96
what no

3070.8 --> 3072.96
i

3081.119 --> 3084.4
hello james mason

3090.079 --> 3094.8
oh yeah by the way thank you seeking

3092.559 --> 3111.8390000000004
star wars for posting that link

3094.8 --> 3111.8390000000004
in the chat i'll check it out later

3137.359 --> 3139.839
all right

3144.0 --> 3147.52
yeah what does sono mean in sono

3146.319 --> 3150.839
luminescence yes

3147.52 --> 3153.92
basically sonic

3150.839 --> 3157.44
sound right but that's a very

3153.92 --> 3160.559
specific thing

3157.44 --> 3167.839
that is created locally

3160.559 --> 3167.8390000000004
in a closed system

3205.28 --> 3210.3190000000004
right okay well

3208.319 --> 3211.44
dude super straight earther i don't know

3210.319 --> 3214.48
what you're on to

3211.44 --> 3217.599
like you've obviously

3214.48 --> 3223.76
dug deeply into this

3217.599 --> 3226.48
the sono luminescence thing

3223.76 --> 3228.0
and you think that it might cause or

3226.48 --> 3230.2400000000002
have an influence on the pressure

3228.0 --> 3231.92
gradient well look even if it's subsonic

3230.24 --> 3235.04
it's measurable

3231.92 --> 3237.76
so yeah this is how it always works if

3235.04 --> 3240.88
you're going to presume that that is a

3237.76 --> 3244.0
transpiring effect within

3240.88 --> 3246.319
the realm a natural effect you got to

3244.0 --> 3249.2
scale it up

3246.319 --> 3249.52
everything right because the realm is a

3249.2 --> 3252.24
big

3249.52 --> 3253.68
place right it's not that little tube

3252.24 --> 3258.319
thing

3253.68 --> 3260.96
so you scale it up then you basically

3258.319 --> 3262.64
figure out okay what is the strength of

3260.96 --> 3265.04
this

3262.64 --> 3266.4
subsonic sound effect going to have to

3265.04 --> 3270.079
be roughly

3266.4 --> 3272.8
in relation to the scale of the realm

3270.079 --> 3273.2000000000003
and then you start measuring is that

3272.8 --> 3276.2400000000002
here

3273.2 --> 3282.0
is that strength of that sound here

3276.24 --> 3282.0
right is it is it super straight arthur

3285.04 --> 3292.16
yeah but yeah that's very nice about the

3288.72 --> 3294.0789999999997
whale sound but that's a specific local

3292.16 --> 3297.839
thing that's like

3294.079 --> 3299.92
traveling at a great distance

3297.839 --> 3301.359
because of the nature of that sound and

3299.92 --> 3305.04
that sound definitely

3301.359 --> 3305.04
has an audible nature

3305.359 --> 3313.2
right it's accompanied with its

3309.359 --> 3316.48
vocal system so

3313.2 --> 3319.359
it's measurable we might not be able to

3316.48 --> 3319.68
carefully pick it up but it's measurable

3319.359 --> 3323.04
now

3319.68 --> 3325.1189999999997
you're assuming that that unhearable

3323.04 --> 3328.24
effect can cause some

3325.119 --> 3331.92
dramatic influence physical influence

3328.24 --> 3334.64
well then you have to scale it up

3331.92 --> 3336.319
get honest about the thing that this

3334.64 --> 3338.0
sound effect is supposedly

3336.319 --> 3340.799
going to achieve within the realm

3338.0 --> 3344.319
naturally and i have to see

3340.799 --> 3347.52
is that level of strength

3344.319 --> 3350.319
the presumed cause of this situation

3347.52 --> 3353.04
actually there are you picking it up is

3350.319 --> 3355.92
there a constant subsonic signal

3353.04 --> 3356.88
happening at all times in order to

3355.92 --> 3362.48
presumably

3356.88 --> 3364.6400000000003
cause a pressure gradient

3362.48 --> 3367.68
cosmic background radiation what has

3364.64 --> 3367.68
that got to do with it

3374.16 --> 3379.52
dude i'm i'm trying to take your idea

3377.68 --> 3382.24
seriously i'm sorry

3379.52 --> 3384.319
if you're not used to that i'm trying to

3382.24 --> 3388.319
take your idea seriously

3384.319 --> 3405.839
just telling you the natural steps

3388.319 --> 3405.839
but you seem to be just moving on

3446.0 --> 3450.3
all right yeah cmb is the sound that's

3448.4 --> 3451.76
very nice so is that sound

3450.3 --> 3455.6800000000003
[Music]

3451.76 --> 3458.2400000000002
correlating with the a presumed size of

3455.68 --> 3461.839
the realm a limited size of the realm

3458.24 --> 3461.839
and does it have that strength

3462.48 --> 3466.319
so that it could cause a pressure

3464.48 --> 3470.2400000000002
gradient

3466.319 --> 3473.599
i mean come on can you model this out

3470.24 --> 3476.799
or not are you gonna take this beyond

3473.599 --> 3476.799
just an idea

3476.88 --> 3480.559
or are you actually gonna try to figure

3479.76 --> 3489.8390000000004
out if it

3480.559 --> 3489.8390000000004
if there's something to this

3490.079 --> 3497.76
are you claiming cosmic background

3493.119 --> 3497.76
radiation sound is the cause

3498.079 --> 3503.8390000000004
for the pressure gradient is that what

3500.0 --> 3503.839
you're saying super straight earther

3505.28 --> 3517.8390000000004
do you have the metrics to back that up

3528.839 --> 3531.839
okay

3549.599 --> 3552.6400000000003
considering the effects from counter

3552.0 --> 3556.16
space

3552.64 --> 3559.839
what seeking star water

3556.16 --> 3559.839
what is that

3565.68 --> 3569.359
please do jump in okay

3569.57 --> 3572.2400000000002
[Music]

3570.64 --> 3574.24
like a super straight earther needs to

3572.24 --> 3576.24
think about this

3574.24 --> 3579.4399999999996
i think a lot of people have a lot of

3576.24 --> 3581.839
ideas and they're used to just

3579.44 --> 3584.0
juggling it about and they don't expect

3581.839 --> 3584.72
somebody to subtly build something out

3584.0 --> 3587.839
of it

3584.72 --> 3587.839
right in front of them

3588.559 --> 3601.8390000000004
so maybe just need some time to think

3590.72 --> 3601.839
about everything i just said

3613.28 --> 3617.2000000000003
right well super straighter third

3619.599 --> 3625.839
yes sound could be an influence but

3622.72 --> 3628.24
when we're talking about the realm i

3625.839 --> 3632.16
would like you to back that up

3628.24 --> 3635.5989999999997
because we can definitely measure

3632.16 --> 3636.48
heat differential and then directly see

3635.599 --> 3639.3590000000004
the results

3636.48 --> 3641.04
of its influence on the gas pressure and

3639.359 --> 3644.4
it causing a gradient

3641.04 --> 3647.52
now in order to prove that

3644.4 --> 3649.839
sound is indeed an influence too

3647.52 --> 3651.599
you have to kind of test that and i i

3649.839 --> 3653.7599999999998
just handed you

3651.599 --> 3657.599
a way to figure out whether that's going

3653.76 --> 3660.559
on or not

3657.599 --> 3663.2000000000003
yeah but now you're just reifying it you

3660.559 --> 3671.8390000000004
you didn't actually bring the metrics to

3663.2 --> 3671.839
back up your claim super straight arthur

3671.92 --> 3675.6800000000003
where's the data to prove this

3679.28 --> 3684.48
right just because sound can be a

3682.559 --> 3688.6400000000003
gradiating influence doesn't mean

3684.48 --> 3692.16
that it is the gradiating influence or

3688.64 --> 3694.96
a sizable contributor to it you have to

3692.16 --> 3699.839
bring the metrics to actually

3694.96 --> 3699.839
prove it right

3706.96 --> 3727.839
hey clutch bear what the seeking

3713.119 --> 3727.839
campers have a little counter space what

3738.839 --> 3743.599
like

3740.48 --> 3746.96
sound particles

3743.599 --> 3748.6400000000003
uh i think you got a little mixed up

3746.96 --> 3752.7200000000003
there buddy

3748.64 --> 3752.72
yeah sound is not a particle

3753.359 --> 3768.48
sound is definitely a wave

3757.44 --> 3771.92
it's not a particle

3768.48 --> 3774.16
weirder weakness equation what what's

3771.92 --> 3774.16
that

3777.2 --> 3783.839
yeah i know that here we go again

3799.039 --> 3811.2000000000003
what what is

3802.079 --> 3814.48
that got to do with it

3811.2 --> 3815.9199999999996
this that's just mathematics

3814.48 --> 3818.96
what does that prove where's the

3815.92 --> 3823.28
empirical data to back up your claim

3818.96 --> 3825.2
math is not it's conceptual

3823.28 --> 3827.8390000000004
if you're going to make a claim about a

3825.2 --> 3830.319
situation in the realm

3827.839 --> 3830.96
you got to bring some data you got to

3830.319 --> 3834.64
bring in

3830.96 --> 3838.0
the metrics and then use that

3834.64 --> 3840.0
to defend your case of the

3838.0 --> 3841.52
claim you made that sound has an

3840.0 --> 3844.88
influence on the gradient so

3841.52 --> 3848.16
is there however you're

3844.88 --> 3850.319
assuming that's going to be achieved

3848.16 --> 3851.2799999999997
where's the measurements of this

3850.319 --> 3854.96
subsonic

3851.28 --> 3854.96
sound i guess where is it

3856.48 --> 3862.16
what strength is it at how big

3860.079 --> 3864.4
does the realm need to be in relation to

3862.16 --> 3867.2
that strength in order to be able to

3864.4 --> 3870.7200000000003
achieve a gradating influence

3867.2 --> 3880.96
right modeling come on people

3870.72 --> 3885.52
it's not tough

3880.96 --> 3885.52
oh matter originates from counter space

3892.839 --> 3898.0
what

3895.119 --> 3900.0
metrics not with metrics i mean

3898.0 --> 3903.119
measurements

3900.0 --> 3906.64
measurement results the

3903.119 --> 3910.799
the the filling of the

3906.64 --> 3913.44
structural formula the suggestion right

3910.799 --> 3915.119
sound creating gradient how strong does

3913.44 --> 3916.2400000000002
that sound need to be where's the

3915.119 --> 3919.839
measurement

3916.24 --> 3920.9599999999996
come on how clear do i need to lay this

3919.839 --> 3923.599
out

3920.96 --> 3924.96
i mean are i would like to hear other

3923.599 --> 3926.559
people's opinion about this

3924.96 --> 3928.4
in chat if they've been paying attention

3926.559 --> 3930.48
like are you

3928.4 --> 3932.559
understanding what i'm trying to convey

3930.48 --> 3936.4
here

3932.559 --> 3937.92
am i being overly difficult

3936.4 --> 3939.839
i thought it was being pretty

3937.92 --> 3943.2000000000003
straightforward just like

3939.839 --> 3945.0389999999998
here it is if i was really interested

3943.2 --> 3951.839
in achieving this this is how i would

3945.039 --> 3951.8390000000004
try to do it

3958.4 --> 3960.64
no

3963.2 --> 3967.9199999999996
the pressure not pressure great yeah

3965.52 --> 3971.119
pressure gradients

3967.92 --> 3976.64
i already said yeah sure

3971.119 --> 3976.6400000000003
it sound can have an influence

3977.76 --> 3983.44
it's just that out here in the realm

3980.799 --> 3985.52
that's the case that i'm interested in i

3983.44 --> 3987.839
mean i'm because cosmogenist i'm trying

3985.52 --> 3989.92
to figure it out okay

3987.839 --> 3991.68
and yeah what causes the gradient has

3989.92 --> 3993.76
been a question that

3991.68 --> 3995.9199999999996
in previous times never really thought

3993.76 --> 3998.7200000000003
about it too deeply and i just kind of

3995.92 --> 4002.7200000000003
assumed like relative density would be

3998.72 --> 4005.52
the cause of it but yeah since i know

4002.72 --> 4006.5589999999997
more about the nature of gas through

4005.52 --> 4010.48
just

4006.559 --> 4012.4
theoretical exposure especially

4010.48 --> 4013.68
figured out like no that's not that's

4012.4 --> 4016.7200000000003
not the cause so now

4013.68 --> 4019.359
i am engaging it's figuring out yeah

4016.72 --> 4022.24
what does cause the pressure gradient

4019.359 --> 4023.359
because relative density is not it

4022.24 --> 4026.799
because gases do

4023.359 --> 4029.68
mix up now i have my own

4026.799 --> 4031.599
ideas about how that happens and i think

4029.68 --> 4034.96
that's like a you know

4031.599 --> 4038.4
in homogeneous mass and that

4034.96 --> 4042.319
perhaps the denser gases do

4038.4 --> 4044.2400000000002
kind of tend to mash out at the lower

4042.319 --> 4048.16
part

4044.24 --> 4052.16
of the container and the less dense gas

4048.16 --> 4055.2
then then tend to spread out

4052.16 --> 4057.2799999999997
mash out at the higher parts

4055.2 --> 4059.2
of the gas within the container but

4057.28 --> 4061.28
that's just a concept

4059.2 --> 4062.799
i haven't actually tested it it would

4061.28 --> 4065.3590000000004
make sense

4062.799 --> 4067.92
that that would be a relative density

4065.359 --> 4069.359
influence despite it being gas going in

4067.92 --> 4072.079
all directions

4069.359 --> 4072.96
right it's just an idea that's that's

4072.079 --> 4077.44
about it

4072.96 --> 4080.64
that's when it goes to the influence

4077.44 --> 4080.64
of the gradient

4080.96 --> 4084.16
so there's other influences and i think

4083.119 --> 4086.88
that it is

4084.16 --> 4088.0789999999997
temperature that is the main influencer

4086.88 --> 4090.2400000000002
for the gradient

4088.079 --> 4091.6800000000003
but hey maybe super straight earther is

4090.24 --> 4093.68
on to something with this

4091.68 --> 4097.5199999999995
sound based idea that there might be

4093.68 --> 4101.92
some kind of subsonic influence to also

4097.52 --> 4105.120000000001
cause a gradation formation

4101.92 --> 4108.56
on top of the temperatures

4105.12 --> 4111.759
well if you're going to say that and

4108.56 --> 4115.120000000001
really stand by it

4111.759 --> 4116.96
as to a cause of the gradient out there

4115.12 --> 4120.4
in the realm

4116.96 --> 4123.04
then measure it figure out

4120.4 --> 4125.92
how strong what is the setup that you're

4123.04 --> 4128.08
suggesting with this sound effect

4125.92 --> 4129.92
you know it's going to be like the

4128.08 --> 4130.64
little bottle it's going to be a small

4129.92 --> 4133.839
container

4130.64 --> 4136.400000000001
right so you then scale it up

4133.839 --> 4139.359
let's do it into how big you think the

4136.4 --> 4139.3589999999995
container might be

4139.44 --> 4146.08
you spot for the pressure

4143.12 --> 4147.3589999999995
the gradiating effects within the setup

4146.08 --> 4151.199
the presumed setup

4147.359 --> 4153.6
and then you well you measure out how

4151.199 --> 4155.599999999999
or you calculate how strong would that

4153.6 --> 4156.319
subsonic sound need to be in order to

4155.6 --> 4158.719
cause that

4156.319 --> 4160.56
within a much larger container which is

4158.719 --> 4163.839
the realm

4160.56 --> 4167.1990000000005
and then see okay is this subsonic sound

4163.839 --> 4167.759
active is it here can we pick that up is

4167.199 --> 4169.759
it

4167.759 --> 4172.319
the strength that it would need to be in

4169.759 --> 4175.839
order to have a gradating influence

4172.319 --> 4175.839000000001
well there you go

4199.19 --> 4204.96
[Music]

4202.159 --> 4207.599999999999
when do you go back what what are you

4204.96 --> 4207.6
talking about

4215.199 --> 4221.839999999999
do the research yourself just don't look

4218.32 --> 4225.679
dude you're the one that claimed

4221.84 --> 4228.719
or at least i thought you did claimed

4225.679 --> 4231.4400000000005
that subsonics is an influence in the

4228.719 --> 4234.56
gradation within the realm

4231.44 --> 4236.5599999999995
so then i asked okay why don't you bring

4234.56 --> 4238.0
the metrics why don't you bring the data

4236.56 --> 4241.120000000001
for that

4238.0 --> 4245.52
if you really stand by that claim

4241.12 --> 4248.5599999999995
but i guess you're catching on to that

4245.52 --> 4251.120000000001
action and you're retracting you don't

4248.56 --> 4254.400000000001
really claim

4251.12 --> 4256.159
with certainty that it is a

4254.4 --> 4258.4
basically a natural effect that is

4256.159 --> 4260.879999999999
happening out there all right i

4258.4 --> 4263.5199999999995
understand

4260.88 --> 4265.52
you know but i was kind of interested it

4263.52 --> 4267.52
at the notion

4265.52 --> 4271.4400000000005
just thought okay this guy is claiming

4267.52 --> 4271.4400000000005
that well you might be on to something

4271.52 --> 4276.4800000000005
here is how to figure it out how to kind

4273.76 --> 4276.4800000000005
of prove it

4278.719 --> 4287.84
just trying to help out

4314.96 --> 4321.36
right now but sound is not

4318.239 --> 4323.678999999999
a particle it vibrates the gases

4321.36 --> 4324.799999999999
and then causes pressure differential

4323.679 --> 4328.64
because of that

4324.8 --> 4331.1990000000005
because of its influence but it is a

4328.64 --> 4335.12
wave and it's not misleading to call it

4331.199 --> 4339.44
solely a wave it is sound is just a wave

4335.12 --> 4344.239
it's a pattern a pattern effect and

4339.44 --> 4344.239
pattern influence an effect a wave

4344.32 --> 4351.36
it's the matter that actually does

4347.92 --> 4354.64
the yeah that's being subjected to it

4351.36 --> 4357.92
and that is causing the effect

4354.64 --> 4360.400000000001
the influence the sound on the matter

4357.92 --> 4363.76
that is doing the things it's the matter

4360.4 --> 4363.759999999999
that in the end is doing it

4364.64 --> 4371.84
show me your data what no it's

4367.92 --> 4371.84
my data for what

4374.0 --> 4382.56
are you kidding me show me my data

4379.199 --> 4385.839999999999
that sound is not a particle in a wave

4382.56 --> 4385.84
are you kidding me

4391.84 --> 4400.88
i can be serious

4396.159 --> 4405.12
this is established fact from way back

4400.88 --> 4408.8
come on are you seriously trying to

4405.12 --> 4413.84
dispute that sound is a wave

4408.8 --> 4413.84
that's quite preposterous

4419.12 --> 4425.28
look dude i'm sorry if if i

4422.8 --> 4426.0
suggested that you made a claim of the

4425.28 --> 4429.12
nature of the

4426.0 --> 4430.32
realm with your sound influence i might

4429.12 --> 4433.199
have mistakenly

4430.32 --> 4435.759999999999
thought that you were making that claim

4433.199 --> 4438.879999999999
you don't have to

4435.76 --> 4440.08
get all nutty on me and then tell me to

4438.88 --> 4443.4400000000005
back data that

4440.08 --> 4447.36
sound is a wave i mean you're not gonna

4443.44 --> 4449.36
find any real data out there

4447.36 --> 4450.719
that's gonna say anything else because

4449.36 --> 4455.839999999999
sound is a wave

4450.719 --> 4455.84
this is really bizarre

4457.04 --> 4462.0
reject accept now it's

4462.08 --> 4468.719
it's not a belief sound is a wave

4466.4 --> 4471.199
it's been established through science

4468.719 --> 4475.04
for science for the scientific method

4471.199 --> 4475.04
it it can't

4480.48 --> 4488.239
that guy this is quite absurd

4484.61 --> 4492.159
[Music]

4488.239 --> 4494.799999999999
so is light no no light is actually

4492.159 --> 4496.799999999999
there's been extensive work to prove

4494.8 --> 4499.84
that light is not a wave

4496.8 --> 4503.04
just because it has wave

4499.84 --> 4506.8
like patterns

4503.04 --> 4507.92
patterns not really completely compliant

4506.8 --> 4510.56
with a wave

4507.92 --> 4513.28
though you know it has patterns this is

4510.56 --> 4513.280000000001
called again the

4515.679 --> 4523.12
the double slit yeah it has a

4519.44 --> 4525.759999999999
wave like pattern

4523.12 --> 4528.159
it's not a wave though that's been

4525.76 --> 4530.8
thoroughly tested so yeah there we go

4528.159 --> 4532.5599999999995
it's a weird it's an aberrant thing i'm

4530.8 --> 4533.76
not ready to declare it a complete

4532.56 --> 4536.400000000001
aberration but it just

4533.76 --> 4539.360000000001
for me how what my conclusion out of it

4536.4 --> 4543.36
was is like is just something else

4539.36 --> 4545.44
light is not a wave

4543.36 --> 4546.4
and i don't agree that it's a particle

4545.44 --> 4550.799999999999
either

4546.4 --> 4553.36
it it's not the idea of the particle

4550.8 --> 4555.6
it doesn't really abide by it you could

4553.36 --> 4557.839999999999
think of it as a particle

4555.6 --> 4558.64
it's not really a particle because i

4557.84 --> 4561.679
think

4558.64 --> 4565.280000000001
i'm personally convinced

4561.679 --> 4565.6
that light is like you can split light

4565.28 --> 4568.5599999999995
up

4565.6 --> 4570.8
indefinitely it's not a minimum sized

4568.56 --> 4573.360000000001
particle of anything it's just that

4570.8 --> 4575.04
the tools we have to register its

4573.36 --> 4578.88
existence

4575.04 --> 4581.92
are the limitation since we use matter

4578.88 --> 4584.08
to register light yeah

4581.92 --> 4585.76
light absorption is going to be bound by

4584.08 --> 4587.76
matter

4585.76 --> 4589.4400000000005
so if we're going to try to get some

4587.76 --> 4590.320000000001
kind of minimum it's always going to be

4589.44 --> 4593.44
the matter

4590.32 --> 4597.199
in the end that's going to be

4593.44 --> 4598.0
like the first response so you can't use

4597.199 --> 4601.04
really

4598.0 --> 4604.48
you can never use matter to prove that

4601.04 --> 4605.36
light is infinitely divisible but you

4604.48 --> 4609.28
could

4605.36 --> 4612.719
extrapolate it from effects

4609.28 --> 4614.88
out there it just

4612.719 --> 4617.28
takes your concept of sight and what

4614.88 --> 4619.1990000000005
must transpire it's like there's no way

4617.28 --> 4621.36
it's a particle

4619.199 --> 4623.839999999999
but at the same time it's not a wave

4621.36 --> 4623.839999999999
either

4624.48 --> 4628.159
so yeah light is weird

4629.84 --> 4633.84
and i have doubts about certain claims

4633.12 --> 4636.5599999999995
that are made

4633.84 --> 4637.76
about light too you know as a particle

4636.56 --> 4639.52
but then again

4637.76 --> 4640.96
there's not that many claims it's

4639.52 --> 4642.4800000000005
particles basically kind of a

4640.96 --> 4645.84
superficial stamp

4642.48 --> 4645.839999999999
to just classify it

4646.08 --> 4649.5199999999995
it's not really like matter though and

4648.8 --> 4652.400000000001
that

4649.52 --> 4665.84
is very well recognized like light is

4652.4 --> 4665.839999999999
definitely different from matter

4674.64 --> 4682.400000000001
get that out of here every time

4678.32 --> 4682.4
dude i've never crashed my bike ever

4684.8 --> 4689.92
i don't get into accidents i see that

4687.679 --> 4692.4
[ __ ] coming

4689.92 --> 4693.28
you know accidents are not caused by

4692.4 --> 4696.48
vehicles

4693.28 --> 4698.48
accidents are caused by people you can

4696.48 --> 4700.32
feel it

4698.48 --> 4701.5199999999995
through the people you can feel their

4700.32 --> 4704.96
trajectory

4701.52 --> 4705.679
you can feel their state now at least i

4704.96 --> 4708.56
can

4705.679 --> 4710.0
so no accidents i don't get into

4708.56 --> 4714.4800000000005
accidents ever

4710.0 --> 4717.199
ever doesn't happen it might

4714.48 --> 4718.718999999999
might happen if i'm completely flustered

4717.199 --> 4720.5599999999995
by basically

4718.719 --> 4724.159
having maneuvered myself into a

4720.56 --> 4726.400000000001
situation where i'm getting too many

4724.159 --> 4727.5199999999995
like upheavaling things all at the same

4726.4 --> 4730.719
time

4727.52 --> 4732.8
but guess what i freaking plan for that

4730.719 --> 4733.84
so it doesn't happen yeah i don't get

4732.8 --> 4736.159000000001
into accidents

4733.84 --> 4736.159000000001
ever

4740.159 --> 4744.159
it's very cute suggestion

4744.56 --> 4748.88
oh [ __ ] happens alright it just i'm not

4747.679 --> 4751.679
gonna be involved

4748.88 --> 4751.679
in that [ __ ]

4757.28 --> 4763.84
there's very little random factor

4760.4 --> 4763.839999999999
for me in it

4772.96 --> 4778.32
don't stand near what the hell why

4776.0 --> 4778.32
not

4786.88 --> 4791.84
why are you saying that james mason

4809.76 --> 4813.4400000000005
what the hell are you talking about

4814.96 --> 4833.84
yeah oh wow

4819.28 --> 4833.84
okay this you tried

4840.639 --> 4848.96
now i'm actually quite safe to stand

4843.92 --> 4848.96
near because i secure things

4855.6 --> 4861.84
try humor i i really don't get it sorry

4866.08 --> 4870.48
anyway yeah good show i appreciate

4868.88 --> 4873.12
straight arthur's input

4870.48 --> 4874.08
and getting it onto some cosmogeny i

4873.12 --> 4877.5199999999995
like that

4874.08 --> 4879.199
or indirectly getting it onto it

4877.52 --> 4880.56
i thought it was an interesting input

4879.199 --> 4884.799999999999
though like could

4880.56 --> 4886.400000000001
could sound be a gradiating influence

4884.8 --> 4887.360000000001
yeah it's an interesting thing to

4886.4 --> 4891.44
consider

4887.36 --> 4893.92
and so in that sense i thank you

4891.44 --> 4896.0
for bringing it up on the table and it

4893.92 --> 4899.1990000000005
was able to

4896.0 --> 4901.44
hand out a way to deal with it

4899.199 --> 4903.12
like what could you do if you really

4901.44 --> 4906.159
think sound is an influence

4903.12 --> 4909.599999999999
to the realm sk radiation

4906.159 --> 4911.599999999999
well what type of sound would you need

4909.6 --> 4913.04
what strength would it have to be in

4911.6 --> 4916.0
relation to the size

4913.04 --> 4918.08
of or presumed size rough estimated size

4916.0 --> 4921.28
of the realm in order to achieve

4918.08 --> 4922.48
the gradient that is present and all

4921.28 --> 4925.759999999999
that

4922.48 --> 4927.44
and then account for the heat influences

4925.76 --> 4929.280000000001
which are definitely measurable at

4927.44 --> 4932.719
ground level

4929.28 --> 4934.719
and size up what is probably the the

4932.719 --> 4936.4800000000005
cold influences up there

4934.719 --> 4940.32
and then you combine it in a complex

4936.48 --> 4943.599999999999
hypothesis might be quite a chore

4940.32 --> 4946.4
and it yeah even after you

4943.6 --> 4949.76
model it it might still not really abide

4946.4 --> 4949.759999999999
by the scientific method

4950.639 --> 4955.1990000000005
it might it's it's gonna be quite

4953.04 --> 4957.6
complicated to get real with that

4955.199 --> 4958.879999999999
but hey if you want to think about okay

4957.6 --> 4961.360000000001
maybe sound has an

4958.88 --> 4962.4800000000005
influence on the on the gradient in the

4961.36 --> 4965.28
realm

4962.48 --> 4967.12
then you could model it you could try to

4965.28 --> 4968.5599999999995
figure out okay what would that actually

4967.12 --> 4970.96
require

4968.56 --> 4975.04
are we picking that up because you can't

4970.96 --> 4975.04
measure sound even subsonic sound

4975.84 --> 4987.84
so just let's get real

5001.04 --> 5003.36
what

5007.159 --> 5015.12
acousto optics what

5010.88 --> 5017.52
all right well yeah

5015.12 --> 5017.5199999999995
could be

5018.48 --> 5022.08
if sound is loud enough you can

5020.159 --> 5026.839999999999
definitely start to see

5022.08 --> 5029.84
its influence but that's gotta be pretty

5026.84 --> 5029.84
loud

5031.52 --> 5035.52
and still it's like a more like a frac

5033.84 --> 5037.76
it's a wave

5035.52 --> 5040.159000000001
it's more going to be in a fractal-like

5037.76 --> 5040.159000000001
pattern

5040.239 --> 5043.839999999999
rhythmic pattern

5048.96 --> 5054.159
this research is not allowed what

5051.6 --> 5054.159000000001
research

5054.48 --> 5058.959999999999
dude whatever i get i gave you all the

5057.679 --> 5061.52
input i could

5058.96 --> 5062.8
i i really don't have anything more to

5061.52 --> 5071.52
it to contribute

5062.8 --> 5074.719
about the subject

5071.52 --> 5074.719
can you see pressure

5075.6 --> 5082.2390000000005
well with sound sometimes

5078.8 --> 5082.56
if it's really distinct like you can see

5082.239 --> 5086.239
as

5082.56 --> 5088.4800000000005
a shockwave from an explosion you can

5086.239 --> 5092.5599999999995
see that

5088.48 --> 5094.799999999999
because of its dramatic influence on the

5092.56 --> 5099.84
material it passes through

5094.8 --> 5099.84
you can see the material respond to it

5180.84 --> 5183.84
so

5201.76 --> 5211.84
all right

5223.44 --> 5225.839999999999
what

5236.719 --> 5253.84
i have no idea what you're talking about

5264.84 --> 5267.84
so

5278.84 --> 5281.84
hmm

5295.6 --> 5302.0
right so yeah i don't know

5299.679 --> 5303.4400000000005
what's going on here maybe you're all

5302.0 --> 5306.96
just getting

5303.44 --> 5310.159
be dwell by the summer or something

5306.96 --> 5312.639
but yeah this chat

5310.159 --> 5312.638999999999
i don't know

5319.04 --> 5326.48
right but anyway yes agm

5322.4 --> 5326.48
that sounds sensible enough

5326.639 --> 5337.84
i don't know who johnny

5330.48 --> 5337.839999999999
sierrucci is

5346.8 --> 5353.28
we looked into acoustic levitation

5350.0 --> 5353.28
well not very deeply

5357.36 --> 5364.48
but i've heard of the concept and

5360.88 --> 5367.679
that it was probably being used

5364.48 --> 5370.718999999999
in basically occult old

5367.679 --> 5370.719
building techniques

5374.08 --> 5379.84
it's an effect now that's something else

5390.84 --> 5393.84
dude

5418.84 --> 5421.84
so

5488.84 --> 5491.84
so

5502.84 --> 5505.84
right

5526.0 --> 5537.679
yeah clutch bear i know what you mean

5532.639 --> 5540.8
i don't know what it is maybe it's just

5537.679 --> 5541.76
this summer feel or something like i

5540.8 --> 5543.92
feel

5541.76 --> 5547.360000000001
in a way i'm okay with this just sitting

5543.92 --> 5550.8
here i'm pretty relaxed

5547.36 --> 5552.88
i'm doing fine but yeah

5550.8 --> 5555.6
i'm getting a bit of scattered input

5552.88 --> 5555.6
from the chat

5556.0 --> 5562.96
and i'm not overly fascinated with sound

5559.52 --> 5564.88
too much although yeah this guy did

5562.96 --> 5567.6
super straight earth or did bring up a

5564.88 --> 5572.56
couple of interesting

5567.6 --> 5572.56
things so i do appreciate the

5572.84 --> 5575.84
conversation

5586.84 --> 5589.84
so

5604.8 --> 5609.12
oh by the way yeah that's right yeah

5607.199 --> 5611.36
tony sleeping warrior had a pretty good

5609.12 --> 5615.5199999999995
video upload too

5611.36 --> 5618.08
from yeah somewhere before my show

5615.52 --> 5619.76
was pretty good so i recommend checking

5618.08 --> 5631.84
that out about relative density it's

5619.76 --> 5631.84
pretty good

5642.32 --> 5645.84
i did also watch tea time with gary and

5644.56 --> 5659.84
terry yesterday

5645.84 --> 5659.84
dude i forgot to make a note whatever

5664.639 --> 5668.08
who is that mowing the lawns i don't

5666.639 --> 5670.2390000000005
know it's just

5668.08 --> 5673.84
i think a company that mows the lawn

5670.239 --> 5673.839999999999
over there

5675.6 --> 5681.76
from the mormon church

5678.719 --> 5684.84
they have a lawnmower

5681.76 --> 5687.84
corporation that does that every now and

5684.84 --> 5687.84
then

5688.639 --> 5690.96
huh

5691.92 --> 5695.04
hey creation bear

5698.08 --> 5701.76
yeah clutch bear his yeah his talk on

5700.32 --> 5705.199
despair was spot on

5701.76 --> 5709.84
and sometimes like big bear is

5705.199 --> 5712.08
really like on the good point

5709.84 --> 5715.76
and sometimes it shocks me because i can

5712.08 --> 5718.96
get just really

5715.76 --> 5720.2390000000005
well a bit vengeful and it worries me

5718.96 --> 5723.04
sometimes

5720.239 --> 5723.599999999999
it's just i don't really act on it but

5723.04 --> 5726.8
it

5723.6 --> 5728.08
is in me and then like big bear

5726.8 --> 5731.76
definitely reminds me

5728.08 --> 5731.76
like that's not good

5740.56 --> 5743.84
but yeah

5754.8 --> 5759.4400000000005
when he's sleeping where he is next i

5757.04 --> 5759.44
don't know

5768.84 --> 5771.84
hmm

5788.56 --> 5799.84
all right james mason uh yeah i

5790.239 --> 5799.839999999999
appreciate the sentiment

5801.76 --> 5805.1990000000005
yeah i don't really even know what to do

5804.0 --> 5808.0
like with the

5805.199 --> 5810.159
wrath aspect that is a part of me

5808.0 --> 5814.0
because

5810.159 --> 5817.119
like it's not just gonna go away anyway

5814.0 --> 5820.4
because it's it's like yeah

5817.119 --> 5822.5599999999995
how do you make a guard dog stop

5820.4 --> 5824.719
barking in full alert when there's all

5822.56 --> 5828.080000000001
kinds of [ __ ] going down

5824.719 --> 5831.44
you don't and

5828.08 --> 5834.96
i realize that okay you can't

5831.44 --> 5834.96
yeah you can't just drop it

5836.0 --> 5841.84
so i'm just kind of like

5839.04 --> 5841.84
compacting it

5842.56 --> 5846.719
feels almost like i'm just a keeper of

5845.28 --> 5848.48
that spirit

5846.719 --> 5852.159
but at the same time carefully

5848.48 --> 5852.159
protecting it from outside

5852.84 --> 5855.84
pressure

5861.84 --> 5868.639
but yeah periodically

5865.84 --> 5869.52
it does kind of want to show itself like

5868.639 --> 5872.639
yeah

5869.52 --> 5874.719
i remember in the end it's gonna get

5872.639 --> 5879.1990000000005
real

5874.719 --> 5882.0
and i'm not going to be shushed by all

5879.199 --> 5882.799999999999
your little dreams and dream weaving out

5882.0 --> 5885.28
there

5882.8 --> 5885.28
system

5886.08 --> 5890.8
so periodically i am gonna show that i

5889.199 --> 5896.5599999999995
know it's real

5890.8 --> 5898.320000000001
and the consequences will be real too

5896.56 --> 5901.280000000001
for a lot of people out there that are

5898.32 --> 5904.08
just dancing with the beast

5901.28 --> 5906.719
and getting chained up by the beast in

5904.08 --> 5906.719
the process

5906.8 --> 5911.84
right back to that metaphor

5912.4 --> 5918.32
but i appreciate the prayer i'm in a

5915.52 --> 5918.320000000001
little bit of a

5918.639 --> 5924.159000000001
i don't know what kind of a face this is

5920.8 --> 5926.4800000000005
with my conception of god

5924.159 --> 5926.48
it's like

5932.8 --> 5939.76
like i take god extremely serious

5936.56 --> 5944.080000000001
like really really serious

5939.76 --> 5949.1990000000005
but at the same time my honesty

5944.08 --> 5949.199
is like the main power

5949.36 --> 5956.32
so my intellect has to basically also

5953.199 --> 5961.28
just face the higher

5956.32 --> 5961.28
com complications face it

5962.159 --> 5969.04
and that makes me just question or

5965.28 --> 5971.28
doubt certain elements

5969.04 --> 5973.44
concerning god not its existence is

5971.28 --> 5976.719
absolutely certain

5973.44 --> 5980.239
but just the nature of it all

5976.719 --> 5982.56
in relation to myself

5980.239 --> 5984.159
and sometimes i'm stuck a little bit

5982.56 --> 5986.88
more in the perspective of

5984.159 --> 5989.199
just myself and i tend to isolate other

5986.88 --> 5992.2390000000005
things you get more towards

5989.199 --> 5995.5199999999995
in an eager position

5992.239 --> 5997.839999999999
and other times i very much get it

5995.52 --> 6000.96
and then i'm like more easily

5997.84 --> 6004.0
relinquishing my self-hood

6000.96 --> 6006.4
within the oversight

6004.0 --> 6009.84
of the ethereal web of everything that's

6006.4 --> 6009.839999999999
going on

6012.96 --> 6022.0
dude the [ __ ] are you blabbering about

6018.08 --> 6025.76
make an apology to bob and merle get

6022.0 --> 6037.84

6025.76 --> 6037.84

6048.719 --> 6052.999

6049.89 --> 6052.999000000001
[Music]

6057.82 --> 6061.438999999999
[Music]

6065.19 --> 6068.259999999999
[Music]

6090.08 --> 6096.8
right well clutch bear you know

6093.679 --> 6107.84
yes we all have our own paths and we all

6096.8 --> 6107.84
have our own conflicts with creation

6108.96 --> 6121.84
our own tests

6132.32 --> 6135.84
what is this

6135.92 --> 6140.32
man people are triggered today or it's

6138.48 --> 6142.5599999999995

again

6146.84 --> 6149.84
whatever

6170.719 --> 6177.119

6217.679 --> 6233.84
get a life

6244.84 --> 6247.84
so

6261.52 --> 6266.88
so anybody real still out there

6264.639 --> 6269.1990000000005
i would like you to speak up in my chat

6266.88 --> 6272.56
right now

6269.199 --> 6274.48
that would be nice you know i'm here for

6272.56 --> 6278.159000000001
conversations with people in chat

6274.48 --> 6279.36
not the trolls in chat if you see that

6278.159 --> 6282.719
[ __ ] going down

6279.36 --> 6285.599999999999
it would be good of you to speak up

6282.719 --> 6286.84
so that i'm just not just dealing with

6285.6 --> 6289.84
trolls

6286.84 --> 6289.84
people

6293.28 --> 6297.44
thank you thank you tara 306 i'm glad

6295.76 --> 6302.719
you appreciate it

6297.44 --> 6305.678999999999
and iron fe you too

6302.719 --> 6305.679
a tiny wombo

6311.36 --> 6319.119
oh yeah did i mention that bob noddell

6315.52 --> 6322.639
literally threatened me with violence

6319.119 --> 6322.639
over at brandon's yesterday

6324.88 --> 6331.119
like he went pretty far again

6327.92 --> 6334.0
so i think that everybody's just

6331.119 --> 6334.96
echoing it out because they can't

6334.0 --> 6338.8
confront it

6334.96 --> 6342.32
he's their master psychologically

6338.8 --> 6345.52
they don't know how to deal with him so

6342.32 --> 6347.759999999999
everybody's squirting everybody's pissed

6345.52 --> 6350.080000000001
off and irwin's gonna get it oh

6347.76 --> 6352.320000000001
arwen has to be pressured into a corner

6350.08 --> 6352.32
oh

6353.6 --> 6359.1990000000005
because i was mean by

6357.04 --> 6360.719
reminding everybody of what a person

6359.199 --> 6363.839999999999
said one time

6360.719 --> 6364.8
being personally outraged about it then

6363.84 --> 6367.84
dropping it

6364.8 --> 6370.96
so in a response the person in question

6367.84 --> 6374.32
has to go everywhere

6370.96 --> 6376.4800000000005
and bring it up every [ __ ] time he

6374.32 --> 6380.08
comes on life somewhere

6376.48 --> 6384.239
and then face to face he complains to me

6380.08 --> 6387.28
to me why did you do this

6384.239 --> 6388.239
when i brought it up like once i don't

6387.28 --> 6391.36
even talk about

6388.239 --> 6394.4
what happened because i'm repulsed by it

6391.36 --> 6396.0
i'm kind of like just letting it go just

6394.4 --> 6396.48
reminding everyone yeah i know this

6396.0 --> 6398.239
happened

6396.48 --> 6400.638999999999
i know what's real i'm not gonna forget

6398.239 --> 6404.32
it we'll see

6400.639 --> 6407.6
and then he's the weirdo

6404.32 --> 6410.96
grabbler possessed person

6407.6 --> 6414.08
that just constantly brings it up

6410.96 --> 6414.8
like like it's this badge of honor that

6414.08 --> 6416.719
he

6414.8 --> 6419.6
is straw manning other people into

6416.719 --> 6423.119
accusing him of being a pedo

6419.6 --> 6425.280000000001
right and he brings it up

6423.119 --> 6427.759999999999
every single day he's obsessed with it

6425.28 --> 6430.96
and it's something he said

6427.76 --> 6434.08
and then he strawman's me into

6430.96 --> 6435.28
taking it out of context and i just

6434.08 --> 6437.36
addressed it

6435.28 --> 6439.28
and i said it and i'm very consistent in

6437.36 --> 6440.96
my response and i will not forget it and

6439.28 --> 6442.239
i was there live and it has nothing to

6440.96 --> 6444.4
do with any

6442.239 --> 6445.759999999999
argument in the field because it

6444.4 --> 6449.44
preceded it

6445.76 --> 6454.639
even though he constantly says that

6449.44 --> 6458.0
so yeah lots of people triggered

6454.639 --> 6461.04
move out the shock troops because the

6458.0 --> 6461.04
king is triggered

6462.08 --> 6467.5199999999995
he feels endangered that's why he's

6464.8 --> 6469.04
constantly bringing up his own damage

6467.52 --> 6471.040000000001
and then trying to shove it into

6469.04 --> 6472.8
somebody else's shoes that pointed it

6471.04 --> 6485.84
out once

6472.8 --> 6485.84
yeah brilliant

6489.28 --> 6492.32
of course he's watching

6493.44 --> 6499.839999999999
the guy's obsessed

6504.239 --> 6513.839999999999
yes it's it's the downward bias man

6508.0 --> 6513.84
that's right

6528.62 --> 6531.68
[Music]

6546.239 --> 6549.678999999999
but it's all fine you know

6550.239 --> 6557.04
at least he sort of

6553.36 --> 6559.119
face did head on and i think i

6557.04 --> 6563.119
well i dealt with it pretty well as far

6559.119 --> 6563.119
as i could before i got muted

6564.08 --> 6570.4
and yeah

6567.36 --> 6570.4
what's done is done

6571.04 --> 6576.0
and i'm gonna be fine i'm just gonna

6573.76 --> 6579.52
enjoy this nice weather

6576.0 --> 6579.52
have a good clear conscious

6580.239 --> 6585.759999999999
knowing that i've been doing my best in

6584.08 --> 6589.04
many many ways

6585.76 --> 6592.639
very successfully i realized

6589.04 --> 6594.0
the success of my actions and i'm very

6592.639 --> 6595.679
proud of that

6594.0 --> 6598.8
and there's nothing really anybody can

6595.679 --> 6598.8
do about that

6599.679 --> 6606.56
right there there's no entrance

6602.8 --> 6609.4400000000005
to damage i've got it covered

6606.56 --> 6610.8
but thanks for trying and revealing

6609.44 --> 6613.199
yourself
