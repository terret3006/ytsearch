83.52 --> 87.759
start the show please don't forget to

87.759 --> 92.24
and if you haven't already subscribe to

90.079 --> 94.39999999999999
my channel and hit the bell notification

92.24 --> 96.15899999999999
so you know when i'm going live which is

94.4 --> 98.24000000000001
normally 1 pm amsterdam time in the

96.159 --> 101.119
weekdays and 2 pm amsterdam time in the

98.24 --> 103.439
weekend and please also do support me

101.119 --> 105.52
through the paypal patreon super chat

103.439 --> 107.75899999999999
and the membership system join button

105.52 --> 110.72
they'll be much appreciated

107.759 --> 110.72
very much needed

111.119 --> 115.439
yeah

112.96 --> 117.83999999999999
to stock up on some supplements like

115.439 --> 119.83999999999999
fish oil

117.84 --> 124.07900000000001
that's kind of pricey

119.84 --> 127.28
so i could really use the paypal support

124.079 --> 129.2
or like unlike nathan's equipment i will

127.28 --> 131.76
just break down

129.2 --> 135.11999999999998
so it's kind of weird to

131.76 --> 137.51999999999998
start gofundmes for just me or my food

135.12 --> 140.239
or something

137.52 --> 142.72
but yeah it is the reality please

140.239 --> 144.08
support me through the paypal

142.72 --> 146.48
that'll be great

144.08 --> 149.04000000000002
anyway the weather today is quite

146.48 --> 149.04
beautiful

150.0 --> 153.36
it's just

151.04 --> 153.35999999999999
really

154.239 --> 160.879
nice and sunny no haze today at all no

158.56 --> 163.12
trails being left by planes that i can

160.879 --> 163.12
see

165.2 --> 169.28
it's

166.319 --> 172.16
very mild wind and it's overall just

169.28 --> 172.16
nice and warm

176.4 --> 183.20000000000002
some jackdaws starting to build a nest

180.0 --> 186.4
i just saw them carry some fluff over at

183.2 --> 186.39999999999998
the chimney over there

186.8 --> 191.04000000000002
so they are building a nest for sure

200.48 --> 203.35999999999999
it's

201.36 --> 205.68
really nice

203.36 --> 209.28
spring day almost seems like summer but

205.68 --> 209.28
it's not really that warm yet

210.319 --> 212.79899999999998
still

211.599 --> 214.72
nice

212.799 --> 217.44

249.04 --> 255.84
uh yeah it's 18 degrees celsius

253.12 --> 255.84

264.56 --> 270.16
hello gadfly 13

267.44 --> 272.4
jeff gas head

270.16 --> 272.40000000000003
oh

277.759 --> 284.47900000000004
what pacemaker fired off

281.68 --> 284.479
what does that mean

291.28 --> 297.08
did the programming like get scrambled

294.0 --> 297.08
or something

297.6 --> 303.24
but yeah

298.72 --> 303.24
glad you're still with us jeff gassen

323.919 --> 328.639
right so

325.36 --> 328.639
let's see what's been

328.8 --> 332.8
what have i been doing yesterday

332.88 --> 337.71999999999997
watching some infowars i think

339.039 --> 342.08
made by jim bob

344.16 --> 348.56
it was like just oh so

350.84 --> 357.67999999999995
good like he had a new

354.8 --> 359.84000000000003
little jordan peterson deep fake clip i

357.68 --> 360.8
love those

359.84 --> 363.039
i mean

360.8 --> 364.319
of all these clips it's like two-thirds

363.039 --> 366.71999999999997
of them are like

364.319 --> 367.84000000000003
really good and one-third of them are

366.72 --> 371.91900000000004
like

367.84 --> 371.919
oh okay i don't really get it

372.24 --> 374.319
but

373.039 --> 378.08
yeah

374.319 --> 378.08000000000004
last two were just excellent

378.8 --> 383.52000000000004
and yeah i like his live streams too and

380.96 --> 385.919
he gets people on he basically takes

383.52 --> 387.35999999999996
callers and they're usually pretty good

385.919 --> 388.96
callers

387.36 --> 390.0
have their old

388.96 --> 392.0
whole

390.0 --> 393.68
elaborate thing that they

392.0 --> 395.84
have to share

393.68 --> 398.40000000000003
so it's kind of an

395.84 --> 400.479
interesting show to sit through

398.4 --> 404.44
there's live shows

400.479 --> 404.44
hey slow mo moon buggy

408.639 --> 415.44
it detected a bad rhythm

411.36 --> 415.44
and shocked you seventh what

416.08 --> 420.4
a bad rhythm

418.639 --> 421.84000000000003
oh so you had like

420.4 --> 424.4
weird

421.84 --> 426.71999999999997
yeah hard to rhythm

424.4 --> 429.52
like heart rhythm fluctuations

426.72 --> 431.28000000000003
very typical for spring by the way

429.52 --> 433.599
it's weird that the

431.28 --> 435.19899999999996
that your pacemaker would shock you like

433.599 --> 436.4
that

435.199 --> 438.639
huh

436.4 --> 442.23999999999995
because i have been kind of having well

438.639 --> 443.759
i have a very sensitive heart

442.24 --> 445.36
i don't think there's like anything

443.759 --> 446.88
serious with it but

445.36 --> 450.72
i do have like

446.88 --> 453.759
weird kind of skipping beats effect

450.72 --> 456.47900000000004
relatively quickly it's kind of like

453.759 --> 459.199
i i get to figure out when i'm nervous

456.479 --> 460.71999999999997
or something very quickly because my

459.199 --> 461.599
heart starts to

460.72 --> 464.24
like

461.599 --> 466.24
weirdly skip beats like it's like kind

464.24 --> 469.039
of getting nervous

466.24 --> 470.72
but it's never it never really has been

469.039 --> 472.479
like super disruptive but it is

470.72 --> 475.84000000000003
distracting

472.479 --> 478.639
my mother had it too and she got like it

475.84 --> 480.96
really unnerved her

478.639 --> 482.24
like she couldn't handle it i can handle

480.96 --> 484.4
it

482.24 --> 487.84000000000003
i've no idea if my brother have has

484.4 --> 487.84
anything like that as well

489.44 --> 495.759
he might

490.84 --> 497.919
have but not like serious as well

495.759 --> 497.91900000000004
but

498.4 --> 502.56
yeah

500.08 --> 504.15999999999997
i take it you've had some serious stuff

502.56 --> 507.639
happening with your heart if you're

504.16 --> 507.639
gonna have a pacemaker

510.24 --> 515.839
had the flu in december

512.159 --> 517.8389999999999
at heart palpitations for a month

515.839 --> 520.08
well i get them

517.839 --> 522.9590000000001
pretty regularly to be honest i don't

520.08 --> 526.399
talk about it all the time right

522.959 --> 528.8
because it's like there's no point to it

526.399 --> 529.68
it's just a thing that i have personally

528.8 --> 533.959
it's

529.68 --> 533.959
yeah it's genetic i think

534.959 --> 538.64
or epigenetic or whatever

546.8 --> 551.12
so yeah sometimes i have that i just

549.04 --> 553.519
don't really mention it because it it

551.12 --> 556.0
happens with me pretty much on a daily

553.519 --> 556.0
basis

556.32 --> 560.1600000000001
not bad like it's just really

558.8 --> 562.399
distracting

560.16 --> 564.16
when i was younger i i got really

562.399 --> 565.839
nervous when i first started to notice

564.16 --> 567.36
it and i thought like oh something wrong

565.839 --> 568.72
with me oh no i'm going to get a heart

567.36 --> 571.04
attack or something

568.72 --> 574.0
like in my teens even

571.04 --> 575.92
and i at that time i consulted a doctor

574.0 --> 578.08
about it and they did some like

575.92 --> 580.0
listening and

578.08 --> 583.6800000000001
and they said like no

580.0 --> 583.68
it doesn't seem to be serious

585.36 --> 590.399
like it's not something that's going to

586.88 --> 591.2
lead to something extremely

590.399 --> 594.16
like

591.2 --> 594.1600000000001
nothing fatal

596.32 --> 599.44
so i kind of like

597.92 --> 602.24
took that to heart

599.44 --> 602.24
pun intended

602.8 --> 607.519
and i mostly ignore it

605.04 --> 609.12
although yeah when i like get it

607.519 --> 611.68
now for example

609.12 --> 614.72
when i get a panic attack and it really

611.68 --> 617.279
doesn't happen like that anymore

614.72 --> 619.6800000000001
then it always

617.279 --> 621.68
is a part of that right and it doesn't

619.68 --> 624.16
help like it because it makes you

621.68 --> 626.399
nervous or it makes me nervous when i

624.16 --> 628.8
get that sort of thing

626.399 --> 630.959
so yeah is it i always get to question

628.8 --> 633.519
myself like

630.959 --> 636.3199999999999
am i getting nervous because of that

633.519 --> 639.12
or is that the direct side effect of

636.32 --> 639.12
getting nervous

639.279 --> 644.56
right

641.04 --> 646.959
i don't think i'll ever really find out

644.56 --> 649.92
anyway i'm glad yeah you got it back

646.959 --> 649.92
under control again

651.2 --> 657.399
triple bart bypassed in your poof yeah

654.16 --> 657.399
that's heavy

667.519 --> 670.8
it's kind of funny that you mentioned

668.88 --> 673.76
that by the way slow mo moon buggy like

670.8 --> 676.24
december 2019

673.76 --> 678.399
i remember now thinking back that was

676.24 --> 680.48
around the time when i also went to the

678.399 --> 682.399
amsterdam conference flat earth

680.48 --> 684.5600000000001
conference

682.399 --> 686.399
well that was already kind of like very

684.56 --> 687.92
exciting to me because it was going to

686.399 --> 690.0
be the first time i was going to meet

687.92 --> 692.3199999999999
the flat earthers from online face to

690.0 --> 692.32
face

694.0 --> 698.079
and basically like

696.0 --> 700.72
get to the next step like

698.079 --> 703.1999999999999
is this real or is it like all an act

700.72 --> 705.44
and will that that be figured out when i

703.2 --> 706.5600000000001
meet face to face that they're basically

705.44 --> 707.7600000000001
going to be like

706.56 --> 710.16
yeah

707.76 --> 711.8389999999999
we're just doing this act together

710.16 --> 713.8389999999999
because that was still a thing in the

711.839 --> 716.0790000000001
back of my mind right

713.839 --> 718.399
before i had met any of them face to

716.079 --> 718.399
face

718.639 --> 722.399
like it could could all be an act i

720.88 --> 726.48
don't know

722.399 --> 728.88
but yeah when i got there it really

726.48 --> 730.8000000000001
turned out not to be the case

728.88 --> 733.279
and everybody's just

730.8 --> 736.639
doing their thing that that's what it is

733.279 --> 736.639
everybody's just doing the thing

740.32 --> 743.6
there's no real ill will

742.399 --> 746.16
it

743.6 --> 750.32
the big issue is just people kind of

746.16 --> 752.48
getting obsessed or having ego issues

750.32 --> 755.0400000000001
and the infighting that's the real issue

752.48 --> 757.36
in flat earth right there's no like

755.04 --> 759.12
secret cabal

757.36 --> 761.36
of flat earthers that are kind of

759.12 --> 762.399
scheming together in secret not like

761.36 --> 763.279
that

762.399 --> 765.12
i mean

763.279 --> 767.12
to be fair

765.12 --> 769.839
when it comes to the flat earth debate

767.12 --> 770.88
specifically

769.839 --> 773.6800000000001
we do

770.88 --> 775.8389999999999
scheme a little bit

773.68 --> 778.0
in the face of the anti-flat earthers

775.839 --> 780.1600000000001
but yeah that shouldn't be surprising

778.0 --> 784.079
right and by now

780.16 --> 786.7199999999999
right it's now three years later more

784.079 --> 789.04
we're actually

786.72 --> 790.9590000000001
just kind of talking about it right in

789.04 --> 791.92
the open because we figured out like

790.959 --> 794.079
yeah

791.92 --> 795.8389999999999
we can do that now because there's

794.079 --> 797.04
nothing they can really do about it

795.839 --> 800.48
anyway

797.04 --> 802.56
so we can just openly discuss our war

800.48 --> 803.6800000000001
psychological war plans just kind of

802.56 --> 805.4399999999999
openly

803.68 --> 807.76
because there's nothing they can do

805.44 --> 809.2
against it really except for what

807.76 --> 810.24
they've always been doing and that's

809.2 --> 813.76
just

810.24 --> 816.5600000000001
scatter gunning straw manning at homing

813.76 --> 816.56
as usual

819.68 --> 824.88
right but back then 2019

822.48 --> 826.88
i had a lot of in december i did have

824.88 --> 828.72
like heart palpitations and all that a

826.88 --> 832.959
lot as well

828.72 --> 832.9590000000001
and i got that really heavy flu also

837.44 --> 841.7600000000001
but i just thought that it was because

839.12 --> 843.839
of it was the exciting times i'm used to

841.76 --> 846.48
that

843.839 --> 846.48
right anyway

847.36 --> 851.839
you don't know what stress

849.44 --> 854.839
you have until you have heart problems

851.839 --> 854.839
right

856.079 --> 860.7199999999999
yeah the stakes do become a lot higher

858.959 --> 864.8389999999999
when you have more serious heart

860.72 --> 864.839
problems i realize that

872.639 --> 875.6
whoa

873.76 --> 877.68
panicking you lose your memory when you

875.6 --> 879.839
get a pan wow that's serious that's like

877.68 --> 881.68
a yeah that's a real panic attack i

879.839 --> 886.48
haven't had

881.68 --> 886.4799999999999
a real panic attack since i was like

886.639 --> 893.6
13 or 14 and then i yeah well it's weird

890.48 --> 895.1990000000001
to say i i remember losing my memory as

893.6 --> 897.1990000000001
well right even though that's

895.199 --> 900.7199999999999
technically

897.199 --> 900.7199999999999
a paradoxical but

903.92 --> 909.92
but when i say panic attack it's usually

906.56 --> 912.56
more preliminary it never like

909.92 --> 914.399
ah snaps it's never like it shoots

912.56 --> 917.92
through to the other side that doesn't

914.399 --> 917.92
happen to me thank god

918.959 --> 922.959
right it's just like

920.959 --> 925.1199999999999
when i say panic attack it's pretty much

922.959 --> 926.6389999999999
me getting really

925.12 --> 929.199
unnerved

926.639 --> 931.6800000000001
by like trains of thinking that i'm like

929.199 --> 935.199
unable to let go

931.68 --> 937.3599999999999
and that's what i call a panic attack

935.199 --> 939.4399999999999
right and i bet like if i would

937.36 --> 940.88
literally start to translate it to a

939.44 --> 942.8800000000001
person

940.88 --> 943.92
then they might get a panic attack from

942.88 --> 946.72
that

943.92 --> 949.199
because it is like it's just like out of

946.72 --> 949.1990000000001
control

950.959 --> 954.88
turning off the milling wheel and it

952.959 --> 956.399
just can't stop that's

954.88 --> 958.72
what i associate with that but it's

956.399 --> 961.04
never like very serious like really

958.72 --> 963.0400000000001
terror like

961.04 --> 965.199
you feel like you're gonna be jumped by

963.04 --> 967.36
a giant predator so not that sort of

965.199 --> 969.7589999999999
panic attack i haven't had one of those

967.36 --> 972.48
since

969.759 --> 972.48
93

977.6 --> 982.6800000000001
and i had to learn how to prevent that

982.8 --> 986.4799999999999
like

983.519 --> 989.92
being a scaredy cat

986.48 --> 993.279
is kind of dangerous for your health

989.92 --> 996.88
which i yeah i am like sensitive i'm an

993.279 --> 999.279
empath i've always kept those

996.88 --> 1002.0
abilities open

999.279 --> 1004.0
and so i also had to basically learn how

1002.0 --> 1007.519
to psychologically

1004.0 --> 1009.839
prevent myself from well shooting off to

1007.519 --> 1013.04
the other side

1009.839 --> 1015.36
completely losing it during a panic

1013.04 --> 1018.24
at the really train that from a very

1015.36 --> 1020.0
young age on and i guess that also being

1018.24 --> 1022.48
bullied and [ __ ]

1020.0 --> 1025.72
that really kind of forced me to train

1022.48 --> 1025.72
it also

1031.039 --> 1033.36
right

1036.16 --> 1040.4
like there were also times where

1038.4 --> 1041.679
like other kids or something would

1040.4 --> 1044.3190000000002
startle me

1041.679 --> 1046.4
like jump around the corner and make

1044.319 --> 1048.559
scare the [ __ ] out of me and

1046.4 --> 1053.1200000000001
that's really bad for me it's also my

1048.559 --> 1055.12
mother was really could not handle that

1053.12 --> 1058.1599999999999
like she could have a nervous breakdown

1055.12 --> 1058.1599999999999
from being startled

1059.2 --> 1065.039
so yeah with me that result if like if

1062.32 --> 1067.4399999999998
bullies caught on to that [ __ ]

1065.039 --> 1070.0
then i had to like really

1067.44 --> 1072.96
iron myself up and like

1070.0 --> 1076.96
become steel so that i just expect every

1072.96 --> 1078.799
second to be startled by some [ __ ]

1076.96 --> 1081.52
and then if it

1078.799 --> 1083.28
yeah if that worked and it deflected off

1081.52 --> 1085.44
me when they did it then they'd lose

1083.28 --> 1086.8799999999999
interest and stop doing it and then then

1085.44 --> 1089.52
i could finally

1086.88 --> 1090.48
gradually let that put that armor off

1089.52 --> 1092.8799999999999
again

1090.48 --> 1095.2
and that they really consciously prepare

1092.88 --> 1097.0390000000002
for like okay there are [ __ ] out

1095.2 --> 1098.96
here that are trying to startle me and

1097.039 --> 1101.76
because they think it's funny and yeah

1098.96 --> 1101.76
i'm sensitive

1101.919 --> 1106.0
so i learned that trick

1104.24 --> 1109.52
i mean being attacked when you're a

1106.0 --> 1113.52
sensitive person really and intelligent

1109.52 --> 1116.8799999999999
which helps really forces you to just

1113.52 --> 1119.039
create all these internal tactics

1116.88 --> 1120.0800000000002
you have to or you're gonna freaking get

1119.039 --> 1121.679
killed

1120.08 --> 1124.8799999999999
at a young age

1121.679 --> 1127.3600000000001
and not like blatantly it's you'll just

1124.88 --> 1128.88
be like oh look he's too weak you can't

1127.36 --> 1132.3999999999999
survive that's

1128.88 --> 1134.7990000000002
so you have to you must figure out like

1132.4 --> 1137.1200000000001
you must figure it out in nothing

1134.799 --> 1139.12
without people's suggestions

1137.12 --> 1141.84
how to

1139.12 --> 1143.52
deal with the situation

1141.84 --> 1146.32
because every time i would even back

1143.52 --> 1149.12
then as a kid try to talk to my parents

1146.32 --> 1151.2
about it i couldn't get it out

1149.12 --> 1153.1999999999998
and as soon as i would

1151.2 --> 1156.0
my parents would just

1153.2 --> 1157.76
try to help but they wouldn't really get

1156.0 --> 1160.08
it they wouldn't understand the

1157.76 --> 1162.0
seriousness of what was going on they

1160.08 --> 1163.36
would underestimate it

1162.0 --> 1165.679
they wouldn't pooh-pooh it but they

1163.36 --> 1168.08
would just not get it

1165.679 --> 1171.2
so i had to figure it out myself with

1168.08 --> 1173.9189999999999
very sparing advice from my parents

1171.2 --> 1175.919
usually had to resort to my own

1173.919 --> 1178.919
intuition

1175.919 --> 1178.919
right

1183.039 --> 1187.36
with my empath abilities am i able to

1185.28 --> 1188.799
draw pain and sickness away from others

1187.36 --> 1189.76
unto yourself

1188.799 --> 1192.4
yeah

1189.76 --> 1195.12
yeah i am

1192.4 --> 1196.48
although i you can't call it draw it

1195.12 --> 1198.3999999999999
away

1196.48 --> 1200.32
onto it's just that

1198.4 --> 1201.919
if i'm not careful

1200.32 --> 1204.32
especially when i was younger my

1201.919 --> 1207.679
empathic resonance would simply make me

1204.32 --> 1209.84
copy the condition temporarily

1207.679 --> 1212.159
and in a way that does really help to

1209.84 --> 1214.08
understand what's going on

1212.159 --> 1216.4
with the person really you could just

1214.08 --> 1219.4399999999998
like method act the [ __ ] out of the

1216.4 --> 1220.88
moment to analyze what they are like who

1219.44 --> 1223.8400000000001
is that person

1220.88 --> 1226.0800000000002
by basically temporarily becoming them

1223.84 --> 1228.559
through your empathy

1226.08 --> 1230.559
but then yeah if you get obsessed with

1228.559 --> 1232.32
it then you can't let it go and then you

1230.559 --> 1234.0
get all weird

1232.32 --> 1235.2
and that happened to me a couple of

1234.0 --> 1237.039
times

1235.2 --> 1239.6000000000001
but

1237.039 --> 1240.64
i have other abilities that can actually

1239.6 --> 1244.08
like

1240.64 --> 1245.8400000000001
absorb more physical

1244.08 --> 1248.0
energy elements

1245.84 --> 1250.8799999999999
not psychological

1248.0 --> 1252.88
with what i call magnetizing i basically

1250.88 --> 1255.2
tense up my muscles

1252.88 --> 1257.5200000000002
it does something and then i can it

1255.2 --> 1260.0
works even on my own body one part of my

1257.52 --> 1262.72
body can do it to another part

1260.0 --> 1264.72
tense it up and then it somehow i think

1262.72 --> 1267.2
it has something to do with the chakras

1264.72 --> 1268.96
in the hand because they are there

1267.2 --> 1271.1200000000001
it

1268.96 --> 1273.039
what are they nerve endings it's

1271.12 --> 1274.8799999999999
something it's something that was that

1273.039 --> 1277.2
we were designed with

1274.88 --> 1281.7600000000002
it's been explored it's been mapped

1277.2 --> 1284.32
i do it it literally absorbs the pain

1281.76 --> 1286.32
from that location away from that

1284.32 --> 1289.52
location into

1286.32 --> 1291.36
my hand and the muscles of my fingers

1289.52 --> 1292.559
which mostly is my

1291.36 --> 1293.4399999999998
underarm

1292.559 --> 1294.8799999999999
right

1293.44 --> 1297.919
and then

1294.88 --> 1300.64
as i've absorbed it i can even feel what

1297.919 --> 1302.5590000000002
kind of pain it is

1300.64 --> 1304.5590000000002
and that's the more fascinating part i

1302.559 --> 1306.72
can literally just feel

1304.559 --> 1309.2
this is the type of pain i'm absorbing

1306.72 --> 1312.96
here like oh this is

1309.2 --> 1317.039
muscle ache or oh this is a stretched

1312.96 --> 1319.28
muscle or oh this is like uh

1317.039 --> 1320.64
what is it the

1319.28 --> 1322.3999999999999
the like

1320.64 --> 1324.3200000000002
directly like the

1322.4 --> 1326.159
the membrane of your bone right has a

1324.32 --> 1326.96
very specific type of pain when that

1326.159 --> 1331.2
gets

1326.96 --> 1332.48
hurt bruised i can feel that

1331.2 --> 1335.28
i can feel

1332.48 --> 1337.919
exactly what type of pain like sounds

1335.28 --> 1341.36
weird i know

1337.919 --> 1344.0800000000002
what menstrual pain feels like

1341.36 --> 1346.32
yeah not through personal experience but

1344.08 --> 1348.24
because i've absorbed it and then like

1346.32 --> 1350.6399999999999
hey

1348.24 --> 1352.559
okay that's different

1350.64 --> 1354.48
and then cross-reference it in with

1352.559 --> 1356.8799999999999
other women

1354.48 --> 1359.3600000000001
basically with my girlfriends and then

1356.88 --> 1360.5590000000002
just i recognize it now

1359.36 --> 1363.76
so

1360.559 --> 1365.76
i don't have to like as sort of a doctor

1363.76 --> 1367.039
sort of a doctor not any

1365.76 --> 1369.2
official thing

1367.039 --> 1371.28
i can just like i don't have to do blood

1369.2 --> 1373.2
tests and [ __ ] i can just like okay let

1371.28 --> 1375.9189999999999
me feel you

1373.2 --> 1378.96
and then i can just oh i think you

1375.919 --> 1381.44
probably might have this and that

1378.96 --> 1384.32
and that's how i do

1381.44 --> 1384.3200000000002
my healer thing

1385.6 --> 1390.6399999999999
right gets even weirder when i start to

1388.159 --> 1392.96
say that i can sort of

1390.64 --> 1395.8400000000001
occasionally it's not really a con

1392.96 --> 1397.6000000000001
something i can just do on the fly

1395.84 --> 1401.039
when i choose to

1397.6 --> 1404.08
i can also do it remotely

1401.039 --> 1406.799
and i mean like with people on the other

1404.08 --> 1410.48
side of the world as long as there is a

1406.799 --> 1413.9189999999999
direct contact through telephone

1410.48 --> 1415.3600000000001
or even through a picture

1413.919 --> 1416.88
yeah

1415.36 --> 1418.08
that's when things get really weird

1416.88 --> 1421.0390000000002
don't they

1418.08 --> 1421.039
but it is true

1422.64 --> 1427.5200000000002
and well my healer can do it too you

1425.12 --> 1428.799
know i've met my healer face to face

1427.52 --> 1430.799
once

1428.799 --> 1433.279
and that's now like

1430.799 --> 1435.84
four years ago

1433.279 --> 1439.2
well he literally heals me over the

1435.84 --> 1441.76
telephone and i can he he starts

1439.2 --> 1443.919
basically chanting and it's not like

1441.76 --> 1446.96
chanting but it's like actually a

1443.919 --> 1448.4
mechanical spiritual action he does

1446.96 --> 1452.32
and he speaks when he does it to

1448.4 --> 1455.679
describe it and it can literally feel

1452.32 --> 1459.36
like things happening energy wise like

1455.679 --> 1461.6000000000001
energy strands rearranging themselves

1459.36 --> 1464.3999999999999
and all that i can feel that happening

1461.6 --> 1466.1589999999999
in my body as he is chanting on the

1464.4 --> 1467.76
other side of the phone

1466.159 --> 1468.96
so

1467.76 --> 1472.4
yeah

1468.96 --> 1473.44
like i really really don't have any

1472.4 --> 1475.6000000000001
message

1473.44 --> 1479.2
towards people that are like oh you're

1475.6 --> 1482.8799999999999
making it up oh it's all just [ __ ]

1479.2 --> 1485.52
yeah right yeah i have so much practical

1482.88 --> 1487.7600000000002
personal experience with this

1485.52 --> 1490.72
from the receiving and the

1487.76 --> 1492.24
distributing and i just don't care if

1490.72 --> 1495.76
people don't believe that that's

1492.24 --> 1499.64
possible i know it is

1495.76 --> 1499.64
from personal experience

1500.32 --> 1506.1589999999999
clients performing no no i don't i don't

1503.44 --> 1507.6000000000001
use my ability to make money it's an

1506.159 --> 1510.0
occasional thing

1507.6 --> 1511.9189999999999
that way it works the best

1510.0 --> 1515.039
i have considered

1511.919 --> 1516.64
multiple occasions to try to like set up

1515.039 --> 1519.679
an official

1516.64 --> 1521.039
thing with it and and do it for money

1519.679 --> 1525.1200000000001
i

1521.039 --> 1527.279
i i just can't do it

1525.12 --> 1530.4799999999998
i think if i do that something is gonna

1527.279 --> 1532.96
break inside of me i mean it

1530.48 --> 1535.44
to me these abilities are like

1532.96 --> 1535.44
holy

1536.64 --> 1541.8400000000001
whether people realize that or not and

1539.12 --> 1543.4399999999998
if you're gonna tie that in somehow with

1541.84 --> 1545.6
money

1543.44 --> 1547.279
the price of actually getting the money

1545.6 --> 1551.039
for it is bigger

1547.279 --> 1551.039
than just giving it away for free

1552.559 --> 1557.84
right so i just do what i do

1565.52 --> 1569.039
right

1567.6 --> 1571.6789999999999
and

1569.039 --> 1574.4
there are people

1571.679 --> 1576.48
that recognize my ability and they know

1574.4 --> 1579.52
this and they respect this

1576.48 --> 1582.159
so people basically even on an intuitive

1579.52 --> 1583.679
level sometimes come to me knowing that

1582.159 --> 1585.8400000000001
i can help them

1583.679 --> 1589.76
and then i just do that

1585.84 --> 1589.76
i don't even have to know who they are

1589.919 --> 1593.5200000000002
that's happened in the past too where

1591.679 --> 1596.0
just like i would go to parties or

1593.52 --> 1599.6
whatever and people would just see that

1596.0 --> 1601.6
i can do that and just walk up to me

1599.6 --> 1603.76
and they sometimes wouldn't even ask i

1601.6 --> 1605.76
would just see it in their eyes and then

1603.76 --> 1607.44
just like

1605.76 --> 1608.559
let me do this

1607.44 --> 1611.039
just

1608.559 --> 1613.279
never having not met the person before

1611.039 --> 1616.32
and just like looking in their eyes like

1613.279 --> 1619.279
okay i'm gonna do this

1616.32 --> 1622.08
and they'd like really thank me

1619.279 --> 1624.64
afterward like ecstatically

1622.08 --> 1624.6399999999999
sometimes

1625.36 --> 1629.9189999999999
right so

1627.36 --> 1632.32
yeah i just i can't

1629.919 --> 1634.72
financially exploit that ability i can't

1632.32 --> 1634.72
do it

1636.24 --> 1641.76
i mean i'm just like what i'm doing

1638.72 --> 1644.3990000000001
right here i'm open to receive money if

1641.76 --> 1646.72
somebody's like oh my god

1644.399 --> 1649.279
let me throw this pile of money on you

1646.72 --> 1651.679
or something

1649.279 --> 1653.279
i'm not gonna say no to that as long as

1651.679 --> 1655.3600000000001
it's unconditional and out of

1653.279 --> 1657.279
thankfulness and not some kind of trap

1655.36 --> 1660.399
to try to

1657.279 --> 1662.24
force me to utilize like the pudding

1660.399 --> 1664.399
rain like putting rains on a horse if

1662.24 --> 1666.72
somebody's giving me money like that

1664.399 --> 1669.6
that's different

1666.72 --> 1671.2
i can feel that right so i'm always like

1669.6 --> 1674.0
open

1671.2 --> 1677.76
for donations but i can't

1674.0 --> 1680.24
use my abilities for money if my

1677.76 --> 1683.12
thinking patterns start to adapt to that

1680.24 --> 1685.76
format

1683.12 --> 1689.399
bad things are going to happen

1685.76 --> 1689.399
i know they will

1696.559 --> 1698.96
anyway

1705.679 --> 1709.52
ah how much does my healer charge for

1707.919 --> 1711.8400000000001
sessions

1709.52 --> 1711.84
nothing

1712.48 --> 1715.52
he does it for free

1717.679 --> 1721.919
and he knows that i

1719.76 --> 1724.799
am like that too and

1721.919 --> 1726.5590000000002
i'm super like i am

1724.799 --> 1729.039
like

1726.559 --> 1731.279
in awe of that

1729.039 --> 1732.399
and by the way he does charge some

1731.279 --> 1735.039
people

1732.399 --> 1736.2399999999998
but those people that he charges based

1735.039 --> 1739.12
on just

1736.24 --> 1741.6
who somebody is and if he knows that

1739.12 --> 1743.1999999999998
they are going to exploit his his

1741.6 --> 1745.4399999999998
healing ability

1743.2 --> 1748.48
basically for more profit then he will

1745.44 --> 1750.799
ask for it right it's all yeah

1748.48 --> 1752.559
it's all about what are you doing with

1750.799 --> 1754.6399999999999
this disability

1752.559 --> 1757.76
and i'm trying to do what he does and

1754.64 --> 1760.159
i'm teaching he knows that and he

1757.76 --> 1761.6
he's very excited about me

1760.159 --> 1764.159
a lot of the time

1761.6 --> 1766.559
because he knows like i am somebody

1764.159 --> 1768.0800000000002
that's really carrying stuff

1766.559 --> 1770.24
here

1768.08 --> 1773.4399999999998
and he's told me a couple of times like

1770.24 --> 1776.159
you have like pretty

1773.44 --> 1778.3200000000002
powerful abilities really pretty unique

1776.159 --> 1778.3200000000002
too

1779.6 --> 1784.7199999999998
and as does he

1782.32 --> 1787.12
in his own right but different

1784.72 --> 1790.48
different powerful abilities and he uses

1787.12 --> 1792.6399999999999
them very well as well and we basically

1790.48 --> 1796.159
through our different talent ranges we

1792.64 --> 1798.48
can really connect and basically

1796.159 --> 1800.96
form some kind of a virtual unit

1798.48 --> 1803.52
together like that being healers of the

1800.96 --> 1804.799
world and he does it for free but he

1803.52 --> 1806.1589999999999
does charge

1804.799 --> 1808.24
people

1806.159 --> 1810.96
if they have a lot of wealth and he

1808.24 --> 1810.96
knows i don't

1812.0 --> 1815.279
but if i had

1814.0 --> 1817.6
i would

1815.279 --> 1821.279
because i think he's an awesome guy and

1817.6 --> 1823.12
he's he helped so many people right

1821.279 --> 1825.36
and he does it for free with a lot of

1823.12 --> 1827.76
people for

1825.36 --> 1830.24
decades he's known people that he's

1827.76 --> 1832.08
healed for decades for free

1830.24 --> 1834.159
because they're really great people and

1832.08 --> 1838.72
usually it's because like if he doesn't

1834.159 --> 1838.72
do it like a bunch of things just

1839.2 --> 1844.559
go to waste

1841.44 --> 1844.559
it's complicated

1844.88 --> 1848.7990000000002
but he's doing it is like his entire

1846.96 --> 1851.1200000000001
life

1848.799 --> 1853.279
and it really pays off for it's not like

1851.12 --> 1856.2399999999998
every time he does that he weakens from

1853.279 --> 1858.72
it it's he doesn't lose energy from it

1856.24 --> 1860.48
he only really you lose his energy from

1858.72 --> 1862.48
it if he gets

1860.48 --> 1864.32
caught up in it personally somehow but

1862.48 --> 1865.919
he's been training it for so long that

1864.32 --> 1867.6
he just doesn't

1865.919 --> 1870.0800000000002
he knows how to prevent that every

1867.6 --> 1873.6
single time

1870.08 --> 1876.0
i am not that good yet i do still get

1873.6 --> 1877.039
caught up in things

1876.0 --> 1880.24
when i

1877.039 --> 1883.519
apply healing skills and all that

1880.24 --> 1883.519
and yes the empathy

1884.24 --> 1889.679
he has the empathy skills too

1887.519 --> 1892.3990000000001
less detailed than me

1889.679 --> 1895.919
but very strong and he's been very good

1892.399 --> 1898.7199999999998
at basically always keeping the distance

1895.919 --> 1901.279
i don't keep the distance i use getting

1898.72 --> 1901.279
up close

1902.399 --> 1907.4399999999998
right and in that sense i always figured

1904.96 --> 1909.8400000000001
like i'm probably not gonna become a

1907.44 --> 1911.279
healer like him

1909.84 --> 1914.6399999999999
so my entire

1911.279 --> 1918.0
setup spiritual setup is just different

1914.64 --> 1918.0
i do something different

1919.36 --> 1923.1999999999998
but i can

1920.799 --> 1925.84
perform basic healing especially through

1923.2 --> 1929.6000000000001
magnetization

1925.84 --> 1931.76
that comes as a second nature to me

1929.6 --> 1935.76
and it's funny too because when i do it

1931.76 --> 1937.519
i actually build muscles

1935.76 --> 1939.44
it's like healing people it's like oh

1937.519 --> 1942.08
yeah give me your stress

1939.44 --> 1945.519
it's like getting a workout except

1942.08 --> 1945.519
it doesn't take all that time

1947.44 --> 1951.8400000000001
right

1949.84 --> 1955.279
anyway

1951.84 --> 1955.279
he'll win sure

1958.08 --> 1963.84
sean hawkins is going ballistic again

1961.2 --> 1963.8400000000001
is he

1965.039 --> 1969.279
he kicked john hawkins off the stream

1966.96 --> 1969.279
again

1970.72 --> 1973.919
oh god

1972.159 --> 1976.64
shawna sean

1973.919 --> 1979.8400000000001
if shawn must be filling the the bitter

1976.64 --> 1983.1200000000001
sting of the springtime again

1979.84 --> 1986.08
i mean sean is a very bitter person

1983.12 --> 1990.4799999999998
very bitter and bitter people

1986.08 --> 1992.8799999999999
do not respond well to the springtime

1990.48 --> 1994.88
i know from personal experience because

1992.88 --> 1996.72
i have been bitter

1994.88 --> 2000.3200000000002
to a degree

1996.72 --> 2000.32
in my teens a lot

2000.399 --> 2003.36
and even beyond

2003.44 --> 2007.2
and i always freaking hated the spring

2005.6 --> 2009.519
when i felt like that

2007.2 --> 2012.0
just made me more like ah just leave me

2009.519 --> 2012.0
alone

2012.159 --> 2016.48
but don't leave me alone

2014.0 --> 2019.84
let me whine to you about how you need

2016.48 --> 2019.84
to leave me alone

2020.24 --> 2024.32
right

2022.08 --> 2025.76
so i think sean's going through that

2024.32 --> 2030.039
probably

2025.76 --> 2030.039
he is a bitter old man

2046.32 --> 2052.72
this is sean hawkins and brenda

2049.76 --> 2055.599
a power couple damn it sounds more like

2052.72 --> 2058.5989999999997
a political team or something

2055.599 --> 2058.599
sheesh

2062.8 --> 2066.639
right anyway i got some good stuff again

2065.599 --> 2068.079
i

2066.639 --> 2070.159
need to make sure i don't really get

2068.079 --> 2071.44
addicted to this stuff but it's doing so

2070.159 --> 2074.44
much for me

2071.44 --> 2074.44
um

2075.119 --> 2081.8790000000004
i think it's a temporary ginseng

2078.879 --> 2081.879
need

2098.88 --> 2104.1600000000003
bags for money on the streets the bear

2101.92 --> 2105.119
bill nye the science denier that's just

2104.16 --> 2107.44
mean

2105.119 --> 2110.6800000000003
i'm pretty sure sean does not actually

2107.44 --> 2110.68
do that

2128.64 --> 2134.16
it sounds like a new high

2131.2 --> 2138.68
rising of those two couple up

2134.16 --> 2138.68
it's a it will be a terrible combination

2144.4 --> 2148.96
i mean sean hawkins is kind of

2147.839 --> 2151.68
he does

2148.96 --> 2151.68
remind me

2154.16 --> 2158.44
of jordan peterson a bit

2158.48 --> 2166.2400000000002
right he is like jordan peterson's

2162.72 --> 2166.24
[ __ ] older brother

2170.079 --> 2176.4
that he doesn't like to talk about

2173.28 --> 2179.0400000000004
and brenda i don't know what he she

2176.4 --> 2181.92
would even looks like but you know that

2179.04 --> 2184.16
with her marxist attitude and her like i

2181.92 --> 2186.64
don't give a [ __ ]

2184.16 --> 2188.56
she would just like she could just

2186.64 --> 2191.2
literally become

2188.56 --> 2193.7599999999998
a high paid politician in in this

2191.2 --> 2196.56
current american cabinet just like that

2193.76 --> 2199.8
you know she could

2196.56 --> 2199.7999999999997
you knew

2211.839 --> 2215.92
can i get it you know

2214.48 --> 2218.8
i can't do it

2215.92 --> 2218.8
it's so tough

2218.88 --> 2223.599
i bet jim bob's like

2221.28 --> 2225.44
tried that at least like 20 times before

2223.599 --> 2227.44
he got it right during the recording

2225.44 --> 2229.119
there's no way you can do a perfect

2227.44 --> 2233.119
vibrato you know

2229.119 --> 2233.119
in one go spontaneous

2234.48 --> 2239.599
it's so difficult

2236.48 --> 2243.32
i've actually tried it

2239.599 --> 2243.32
off off camera

2259.68 --> 2263.5989999999997
you feel bad for sean

2262.48 --> 2266.4
well

2263.599 --> 2268.96
don't feel bad for him just realize he

2266.4 --> 2273.359
feels bad

2268.96 --> 2273.359
and the st the thing is that

2273.599 --> 2277.599
he's just

2274.96 --> 2281.2
making things worse

2277.599 --> 2284.599
right he's just being incredibly unwise

2281.2 --> 2284.5989999999997
about everything

2285.119 --> 2288.7200000000003
because

2286.48 --> 2291.2
you know

2288.72 --> 2295.04
being bitter and demanding and

2291.2 --> 2297.7599999999998
complaining all the time time

2295.04 --> 2299.7599999999998
why would it seems to a person when they

2297.76 --> 2303.6800000000003
do that like they're trying to get rid

2299.76 --> 2305.5200000000004
of that state but the the fact remains

2303.68 --> 2308.64
and when you do that especially if you

2305.52 --> 2309.68
do that regularly it actually reinforces

2308.64 --> 2312.3199999999997
it

2309.68 --> 2313.2799999999997
it just makes it worse

2312.32 --> 2314.88
and

2313.28 --> 2318.48
most people

2314.88 --> 2320.6400000000003
figure that out as they grow older

2318.48 --> 2323.04
i do not think that sean is one of those

2320.64 --> 2323.04
people

2324.4 --> 2329.92
he really does seem like a like a young

2326.88 --> 2332.32
teenager that's just stuck

2329.92 --> 2334.7200000000003
in that mindset and you just can't move

2332.32 --> 2336.2400000000002
on he just can't figure it out that

2334.72 --> 2339.64
shouldn't do that that it doesn't

2336.24 --> 2339.64
actually work

2340.16 --> 2343.7999999999997
stuck in a loop

2360.8 --> 2365.6800000000003
no normal person could live with it what

2363.2 --> 2365.68
the hell

2366.96 --> 2370.8
okay yay

2369.2 --> 2374.16
door just

2370.8 --> 2374.1600000000003
opening up out of nowhere

2376.77 --> 2380.61
[Music]

2380.64 --> 2383.92
dude sometimes i think this place is

2382.4 --> 2387.28
haunted

2383.92 --> 2387.28
not in a bad way though

2387.599 --> 2392.2400000000002
i yeah but sometimes it's almost like

2390.48 --> 2396.2400000000002
drawers from

2392.24 --> 2398.0
like this cabinet just open up they

2396.24 --> 2400.16
don't open up all the way but they

2398.0 --> 2401.52
sometimes like open up a centimeter and

2400.16 --> 2402.72
i'm like

2401.52 --> 2404.72
that's

2402.72 --> 2406.48
crazy

2404.72 --> 2409.04
but hello

2406.48 --> 2411.44
hi there whatever you are

2409.04 --> 2413.599
don't feel really like you're super evil

2411.44 --> 2415.52
but it's distracting it's like a bunch

2413.599 --> 2417.2000000000003
of gremlins are just in that closet

2415.52 --> 2418.8
sometimes

2417.2 --> 2422.04
and it happens like in the middle of the

2418.8 --> 2422.04
night too

2424.56 --> 2427.44
the weird

2436.0 --> 2439.64
a dirt baller

2440.24 --> 2444.319
sean and brandester god

2445.359 --> 2453.359
oh god can you imagine that sean and

2448.8 --> 2457.079
brenda talking about politics

2453.359 --> 2457.0789999999997
oh jesus

2472.8 --> 2476.5600000000004
it's the ghost of the ball earth

2477.599 --> 2481.839
but that's

2478.64 --> 2484.24
i'm gonna be very pedantic and nitpicky

2481.839 --> 2486.16
but that's technically impossible there

2484.24 --> 2489.1189999999997
can't be a ghost of the ball because

2486.16 --> 2490.3999999999996
that suggests that the ball was alive at

2489.119 --> 2492.56
one point

2490.4 --> 2494.4
and actually existed

2492.56 --> 2496.88
right ghosts are like

2494.4 --> 2499.52
remnants after death well in order for

2496.88 --> 2501.92
something to have died it must have been

2499.52 --> 2505.7599999999998
alive at some point

2501.92 --> 2505.76
ball earth was never real

2512.88 --> 2517.28
it would be the greatest show on earth

2515.04 --> 2517.2799999999997
uh

2517.92 --> 2520.16
well

2520.72 --> 2524.9599999999996
maybe if they like

2522.56 --> 2527.359
as a team went on to joe rogan or

2524.96 --> 2527.359
something

2528.24 --> 2530.64
sorry

2530.8 --> 2534.4
oh [ __ ]

2532.64 --> 2537.839
can you yeah yeah you could probably

2534.4 --> 2537.839
imagine what that would be like

2538.56 --> 2542.4
it would not be one of joe rogan's best

2541.04 --> 2545.119
shows

2542.4 --> 2545.119
guaranteed

2547.92 --> 2552.0
but you know he has the ability to

2550.0 --> 2554.72
completely roll with it no matter how

2552.0 --> 2557.44
ridiculous they get right you know he

2554.72 --> 2557.4399999999996
could do that

2568.0 --> 2571.44
like what are we talking about here this

2570.0 --> 2576.319
is just

2571.44 --> 2576.319
the sean hawkins and brenda show

2577.52 --> 2581.599
or them appearing on joe rogan

2581.68 --> 2588.48
would be a dream come true

2584.56 --> 2588.48
to really you dream about that

2588.72 --> 2592.319
oh [ __ ]

2590.56 --> 2595.119
ugh

2592.319 --> 2595.119
oh my god

2596.88 --> 2600.8
it would be freaking hilarious

2605.44 --> 2611.319
but probably not in the way that they

2607.839 --> 2611.319
think it is

2622.319 --> 2627.599
i bet that if brenda and sean went on

2625.28 --> 2629.6800000000003
joe rogan's that rogan would like

2627.599 --> 2632.8
totally make them fall in love with him

2629.68 --> 2635.839
i mean he can do that he would probably

2632.8 --> 2635.8390000000004
do that

2641.2 --> 2645.839
because yeah brenda and rogan are just

2643.68 --> 2648.319
numpties they're very easily

2645.839 --> 2650.56
influenceable

2648.319 --> 2650.56
so

2651.599 --> 2655.04
he would probably literally start

2653.2 --> 2656.0789999999997
playing them like a fiddle with their

2655.04 --> 2658.56
crazy

2656.079 --> 2658.5600000000004
dreams

2660.079 --> 2664.96
start inserting dreams about maybe going

2662.64 --> 2666.56
to mars or something right

2664.96 --> 2668.96
because you know that will get them

2666.56 --> 2668.96
going

2669.839 --> 2673.04
you would hear a word for all the

2672.0 --> 2677.56
shouting

2673.04 --> 2677.56
oh you think sean is going to do ah

2680.8 --> 2683.599
probably not

2684.48 --> 2688.48
sean hawkins is an actor

2688.839 --> 2694.64
no

2690.8 --> 2698.0
if he's an actor he's the worst actor in

2694.64 --> 2698.0
in stage history

2698.24 --> 2702.839
no he is just an idiot

2705.599 --> 2709.2000000000003
like it

2706.8 --> 2712.079
just a crackhead boomer

2709.2 --> 2712.0789999999997
terrible figure

2713.68 --> 2719.9199999999996
he's not an actor he's not acting like

2716.48 --> 2722.48
he's stupid he really is stupid

2719.92 --> 2726.88
everything he does expresses exactly

2722.48 --> 2726.88
that level that frequency of idiocy

2727.28 --> 2731.599
and i've had plenty of emails from him

2731.68 --> 2735.9199999999996
to know that

2733.92 --> 2739.44
just the way that he talks the way he

2735.92 --> 2741.28
writes the way he formulates things

2739.44 --> 2746.119
makes him

2741.28 --> 2746.119
without any doubt an idiot

2748.8 --> 2752.0
hey what's that

2752.72 --> 2758.16
globe ghosts

2755.04 --> 2760.8
wouldn't leave a tail behind

2758.16 --> 2763.7599999999998
the earth as they detach from moving

2760.8 --> 2763.76
physical what

2768.56 --> 2773.56
why would they stay in the closet what

2776.64 --> 2779.44
i don't get it

2782.64 --> 2786.359
hello by the way geoshifter

2815.68 --> 2817.839
hmm

2823.359 --> 2826.56
man

2824.24 --> 2829.1189999999997
have you guys seen alex steen

2826.56 --> 2831.359
that guy is on a roll

2829.119 --> 2833.599
kind of a creepy role but yeah that's

2831.359 --> 2836.88
his thing

2833.599 --> 2839.839
because now he's like trolled some

2836.88 --> 2842.4
city council about enlisting in ukraine

2839.839 --> 2845.2799999999997
like in military gear but

2842.4 --> 2848.0
he's like like mega shilling for the

2845.28 --> 2848.0
wrong side

2849.2 --> 2853.52
he's like really doing this thing now

2851.28 --> 2856.2400000000002
he's he's found his thing

2853.52 --> 2858.72
have you seen it

2856.24 --> 2862.0
remember alex dean he was like

2858.72 --> 2862.0
on with jaren a lot

2863.839 --> 2869.7999999999997
well he's got the full attention of

2865.839 --> 2869.7999999999997
infowars these days

2876.559 --> 2879.559
so

2894.0 --> 2896.4
right

2897.839 --> 2904.7999999999997
so he's getting out there man i i would

2901.44 --> 2907.359
be jealous if i didn't realize like yeah

2904.8 --> 2910.4
that that does have a price

2907.359 --> 2910.4
in different ways

2910.64 --> 2915.7999999999997
like he will always be known for this

2912.8 --> 2915.8
now

2916.319 --> 2920.319
so he made it into his thing

2920.559 --> 2926.8
he is weird and american indeed

2924.4 --> 2928.64
he's a little he's a little goblin but

2926.8 --> 2930.7200000000003
not not a goblin more like a little

2928.64 --> 2934.72
leprechaun

2930.72 --> 2934.72
he really is like a little leprechaun

2935.839 --> 2941.72
and he's hilarious

2937.599 --> 2941.7200000000003
and he has a lot of energy

2945.92 --> 2953.04
creepy banker type 5 yeah but there's

2948.8 --> 2953.04
all kinds of weird vibes coming off him

2954.24 --> 2959.2799999999997
but you can't deny what he is

2956.24 --> 2959.2799999999997
effectively doing

2961.92 --> 2967.44
yeah he's playing a character role not

2964.559 --> 2968.96
being true yeah no [ __ ] matthew hall

2967.44 --> 2971.2000000000003
you think that that's

2968.96 --> 2972.48
literal

2971.2 --> 2974.5589999999997
like

2972.48 --> 2975.839
i don't want to be rough on you but come

2974.559 --> 2978.96
on man

2975.839 --> 2982.4
it's come on it's obvious he's playing

2978.96 --> 2987.119
and he's acting it's

2982.4 --> 2987.119
it's a giant uh the satire

2990.079 --> 2994.28
that's kind of obvious right

3003.2 --> 3006.8799999999997
what do i think of right to hand i don't

3005.04 --> 3009.2
know i haven't heard from him in a long

3006.88 --> 3009.2000000000003
time

3010.48 --> 3015.52
but yeah i will always remember how he

3013.44 --> 3017.44
got defeated by a girl

3015.52 --> 3020.0
when wrestling

3017.44 --> 3022.7200000000003
and that he he actually recorded that i

3020.0 --> 3025.2
will never forget that

3022.72 --> 3027.839
especially because he was really full of

3025.2 --> 3027.839
himself

3030.0 --> 3035.2
yeah but i've analyzed right to hand

3032.8 --> 3037.3590000000004
on occasion in the past here on the

3035.2 --> 3039.52
early word show i did yeah

3037.359 --> 3042.0789999999997
i don't know don't know how he's doing

3039.52 --> 3045.559
if he's better now or if he's worse than

3042.079 --> 3045.559
ever i don't know

3066.16 --> 3073.44
yeah but matthew i do agree

3068.64 --> 3073.44
yeah alex dean has something off but

3074.88 --> 3077.2000000000003
he is

3077.28 --> 3080.559
it's very odd

3081.76 --> 3085.119
in a way

3082.88 --> 3088.48
he

3085.119 --> 3091.2000000000003
has like spiritual fractures he's very

3088.48 --> 3093.92
sensitive person he's broken

3091.2 --> 3095.4399999999996
but then he's kind of just taken the

3093.92 --> 3099.52
damage and

3095.44 --> 3099.52
uses it against the world

3100.64 --> 3106.0
i've done that in the past

3103.76 --> 3107.92
but then eventually i found a better

3106.0 --> 3110.88
tactic to do things

3107.92 --> 3114.7200000000003
he seems to be holding on to it and has

3110.88 --> 3117.839
weaponized it into his main strategy

3114.72 --> 3117.839
into his thing

3120.4 --> 3123.76
so

3122.4 --> 3127.28
here's the thing

3123.76 --> 3130.48
he's supposed to be giving you an off

3127.28 --> 3132.4
vibe you're supposed to be like

3130.48 --> 3134.319
wait there's something really weird

3132.4 --> 3138.7200000000003
going on here with what he's doing right

3134.319 --> 3140.24
now you're supposed to feel that

3138.72 --> 3143.52
you understand

3140.24 --> 3145.52
it's part of the magic

3143.52 --> 3148.24
it's on purpose

3145.52 --> 3150.319
like really on purpose even if you're on

3148.24 --> 3152.7999999999997
the right track it's not just like to

3150.319 --> 3155.2
give you that feeling

3152.8 --> 3156.1600000000003
if you're like a numpty or if you're

3155.2 --> 3158.0
some

3156.16 --> 3159.2
reversed world

3158.0 --> 3161.68
psycho

3159.2 --> 3164.64
no if you're on the right track and if

3161.68 --> 3167.04
you're empathic you're supposed to feel

3164.64 --> 3168.48
that i've always felt that with him i've

3167.04 --> 3170.5589999999997
always picked up on that and when i

3168.48 --> 3173.119
first got to see him i was like

3170.559 --> 3175.2000000000003
okay he's kind of funny but this feels

3173.119 --> 3176.6400000000003
there's something off about him

3175.2 --> 3180.16
well

3176.64 --> 3183.5989999999997
that something off about him feeling is

3180.16 --> 3186.16
super persistent it's stable

3183.599 --> 3188.7200000000003
it's his thing it's part of the magic of

3186.16 --> 3188.72
what he does

3193.2 --> 3197.04
he misses the target often no

3197.599 --> 3201.04
missing the target

3199.2 --> 3202.24
is

3201.04 --> 3205.5589999999997
part

3202.24 --> 3205.5589999999997
of it

3209.28 --> 3211.599
right

3211.839 --> 3217.599
it's part of it

3214.24 --> 3217.5989999999997
it's part of the build up

3217.839 --> 3220.319
i don't know

3218.88 --> 3223.04
it yeah

3220.319 --> 3223.7599999999998
but i get it he gives me weird vibes too

3223.04 --> 3226.96
but

3223.76 --> 3229.28
he's very consistent

3226.96 --> 3231.559
and i'm very sure that all those things

3229.28 --> 3234.7200000000003
he does it on purpose

3231.559 --> 3236.96
subconsciously i don't think consciously

3234.72 --> 3238.48
but subconsciously he has a plan

3236.96 --> 3241.04
subconsciously

3238.48 --> 3244.0
he's doing something

3241.04 --> 3246.88
he's doing a very special unique alex

3244.0 --> 3248.319
teen dance as it were

3246.88 --> 3251.76
spiritually

3248.319 --> 3254.96
and he does it consistently and

3251.76 --> 3258.48
guided by principles

3254.96 --> 3258.48
that he doesn't really change

3260.64 --> 3265.7599999999998
so i kind of just see it like a dance

3263.119 --> 3268.079
it's just the alextin dance

3265.76 --> 3270.8
and it's really it is hilarious and it

3268.079 --> 3273.2000000000003
does draw a whole bunch of attention

3270.8 --> 3275.44
from people that are really smart to

3273.2 --> 3276.48
people that are kind of dumb

3275.44 --> 3279.119
it it

3276.48 --> 3282.4
it attracts all the attention and that's

3279.119 --> 3282.4
kind of part of it as well

3288.559 --> 3294.1600000000003
yeah he is a smart guy i know

3292.48 --> 3296.48
but he's also

3294.16 --> 3298.16
taken on the clown

3296.48 --> 3300.079
role

3298.16 --> 3302.3999999999996
that's his social role is to be the

3300.079 --> 3302.4
clown

3302.799 --> 3306.88
like kind of hyper active attention dr

3305.599 --> 3308.799
grabby

3306.88 --> 3311.599
funny

3308.799 --> 3311.599
light-hearted

3311.68 --> 3317.1189999999997
and like eccentric too like going too

3314.72 --> 3318.9599999999996
far getting carried away is like a part

3317.119 --> 3321.839
of that too

3318.96 --> 3321.839
it's just yeah

3325.68 --> 3328.64
it's alex dean

3331.2 --> 3335.5989999999997
and yeah he's

3333.68 --> 3337.68
a bit of a leprechaun

3335.599 --> 3338.7200000000003
but yeah

3337.68 --> 3340.799
i mean

3338.72 --> 3343.799
he's pretty awesome for a leprechaun i

3340.799 --> 3343.799
think

3353.2 --> 3359.1189999999997
i mean i myself am kind of leprechaun

3355.839 --> 3362.119
adjacent except yeah i'm an elf they're

3359.119 --> 3362.119
different

3366.48 --> 3371.359
you could call him an elf as well you

3368.48 --> 3374.799
know these terminologies are of course

3371.359 --> 3374.799
very flexible

3375.76 --> 3382.3190000000004
but yeah anyway yeah we got from the

3378.559 --> 3382.3190000000004
grave here squirty boy

3382.64 --> 3387.839
what the [ __ ] is he blabbering on about

3385.2 --> 3391.7599999999998
verification is

3387.839 --> 3394.319
belief of earth being

3391.76 --> 3395.76
yeah yeah it's indeed belief of earth

3394.319 --> 3398.5589999999997
being flat

3395.76 --> 3400.96
in its entirety without verification is

3398.559 --> 3403.28
a presupposition yeah the thing is

3400.96 --> 3403.28
though

3403.359 --> 3409.119
it's not without verification

3406.4 --> 3411.28
the verification is everywhere

3409.119 --> 3413.599
you see the earth is flat everywhere it

3411.28 --> 3416.0
has to be flat

3413.599 --> 3418.96
if the earth wasn't flat

3416.0 --> 3420.079
then your ball earth

3418.96 --> 3423.44
model

3420.079 --> 3427.599
wouldn't have worked

3423.44 --> 3430.079
because it's all based of a flat plane

3427.599 --> 3432.6400000000003
which is the antecedent

3430.079 --> 3437.44
for a functioning

3432.64 --> 3437.44
celestial exploration system

3440.319 --> 3444.16
which is kind of what the ball earth

3442.24 --> 3447.9199999999996
model is based on right it's based on

3444.16 --> 3451.359
the celestial globe the apparent globe

3447.92 --> 3454.4
versus mathematically versus the flat

3451.359 --> 3455.92
earth underneath it how it rotates

3454.4 --> 3459.599
consistently

3455.92 --> 3460.7200000000003
with the flat earth underneath it yeah

3459.599 --> 3463.3590000000004
that's

3460.72 --> 3465.68
where the ball earth model was derived

3463.359 --> 3465.68
from

3470.079 --> 3475.96
yeah making a claim without verification

3472.319 --> 3478.4
yeah oh yeah yeah but you're literally

3475.96 --> 3481.28
insinuating that

3478.4 --> 3485.04
out of nowhere when verification is

3481.28 --> 3485.0400000000004
literally all encompassing

3486.0 --> 3490.48
the natural antecedent for a globe earth

3489.28 --> 3495.52
model

3490.48 --> 3497.68
is a flat earth from the grave

3495.52 --> 3501.68
that's not a claim without verification

3497.68 --> 3504.5589999999997
that's an antecedent relationship

3501.68 --> 3507.44
yeah it's a mechanical

3504.559 --> 3512.079
necessity

3507.44 --> 3515.119
it's literally impossible without it

3512.079 --> 3517.8390000000004
yeah not a claim without verification

3515.119 --> 3520.4
it's an antecedent relationship

3517.839 --> 3524.0
can have a ball earth model without a

3520.4 --> 3524.0
flat earth to base it off

3524.319 --> 3530.599
you getting it yet squirt boy

3527.04 --> 3530.599
you getting it yet

3540.24 --> 3547.2
from the grave is shown up i don't care

3545.119 --> 3550.6400000000003
can be whatever you want

3547.2 --> 3550.64
i'm gonna tell it as it is

3555.04 --> 3559.119
but thank you slow mo move buggy for the

3557.2 --> 3562.64
uh

3559.119 --> 3567.359
for the yeah the intelligence update

3562.64 --> 3567.359
i always appreciate intelligence updates

3568.24 --> 3571.5989999999997
it's good to have somebody that's

3569.76 --> 3572.559
informed

3571.599 --> 3575.88
about

3572.559 --> 3575.88
these details

3596.16 --> 3599.359
measure

3597.599 --> 3601.2000000000003
part of my garden is being level and

3599.359 --> 3603.119
then claim that the entire garden must

3601.2 --> 3606.5589999999997
be level yeah

3603.119 --> 3610.2400000000002
well how about the ocean

3606.559 --> 3613.6800000000003
yeah the thing is about when you measure

3610.24 --> 3616.319
whether the ocean is level

3613.68 --> 3619.1189999999997
then to draw the conclusion that

3616.319 --> 3620.319
if what you measure of the ocean is

3619.119 --> 3623.599
level

3620.319 --> 3626.16
that the entire thing must be level then

3623.599 --> 3629.3590000000004
yeah that's different from

3626.16 --> 3631.839
your your garden right because dirt can

3629.359 --> 3635.119
kind of stack up in hills and all that

3631.839 --> 3636.48
yeah we know he's a very nice straw man

3635.119 --> 3638.4
right

3636.48 --> 3639.44
water however

3638.4 --> 3640.88
finds

3639.44 --> 3644.7200000000003
its level

3640.88 --> 3647.52
it doesn't heap up in hills

3644.72 --> 3648.799
yeah it doesn't form islands that stick

3647.52 --> 3651.92
out

3648.799 --> 3654.48
water finds its level so yeah if the if

3651.92 --> 3657.44
you do that same thing with the ocean

3654.48 --> 3659.839
and oh look it's all flat and level

3657.44 --> 3661.28
yeah yeah then you can definitely draw

3659.839 --> 3662.64
the conclusion

3661.28 --> 3666.96
that the rest

3662.64 --> 3670.359
is therefore also flat and level

3666.96 --> 3670.359
from the grave

3680.559 --> 3685.48
how does water find level

3683.28 --> 3688.48
uh through relative density

3685.48 --> 3689.359
disequilibrium yeah

3688.48 --> 3690.64
i mean

3689.359 --> 3691.7599999999998
water

3690.64 --> 3695.2
is

3691.76 --> 3695.92
denser than the air

3695.2 --> 3699.04
so

3695.92 --> 3701.52
if there's water sticking out in air

3699.04 --> 3703.52
surrounded by a medium of air

3701.52 --> 3706.079
then it's always going to be denser

3703.52 --> 3708.16
right unless it is in

3706.079 --> 3710.48
vapor form

3708.16 --> 3712.799
then it might hang in between there but

3710.48 --> 3717.2
as long as it's liquid which the ocean

3712.799 --> 3719.359
is right the the the actual liquid ocean

3717.2 --> 3721.52
well if it's sticking out

3719.359 --> 3724.0
it's going to be surrounded by gas that

3721.52 --> 3725.68
means it's going to be denser than that

3724.0 --> 3727.2
gas medium

3725.68 --> 3728.799
and then the relative density

3727.2 --> 3731.1189999999997
disequilibrium

3728.799 --> 3734.24
is going to force it down

3731.119 --> 3737.28
until it's surrounded by nothing

3734.24 --> 3738.839
but substance of the same density

3737.28 --> 3744.599
the rest of the

3738.839 --> 3744.599
water and that's how it finds its level

3765.28 --> 3769.76
but seawater is constantly changing

3768.0 --> 3772.24
level

3769.76 --> 3772.2400000000002
tides

3772.72 --> 3778.319
yeah well that's another influence isn't

3775.52 --> 3780.88
it i mean water isn't gonna find its

3778.319 --> 3784.16
level if you keep stirring in it

3780.88 --> 3786.48
with an angel spoon which is the cause

3784.16 --> 3788.5589999999997
of tides in the first place it's like a

3786.48 --> 3791.96
magnetic stirring

3788.559 --> 3791.96
what the [ __ ]

3805.76 --> 3811.7990000000004
[ __ ] kid must have found fireworks or

3807.839 --> 3811.799
something an ass

3815.839 --> 3820.48
right so yeah if you're gonna have

3817.2 --> 3822.72
another variable that's interfering

3820.48 --> 3824.559
like the tides yeah

3822.72 --> 3826.16
if you stir water it's not gonna find

3824.559 --> 3827.92
its level because there's a constant

3826.16 --> 3830.319
influence making it

3827.92 --> 3833.6800000000003
not able to find its level pushing it

3830.319 --> 3835.68
out of equilibrium again

3833.68 --> 3838.0
yeah but that

3835.68 --> 3841.2799999999997
doesn't really take away the fact that

3838.0 --> 3844.319
if there is no such stirring effect

3841.28 --> 3846.799
or when it's not there

3844.319 --> 3848.48
that water absolutely naturally finds

3846.799 --> 3851.44
its level

3848.48 --> 3853.44
it's demonstrable

3851.44 --> 3856.44
now it's not shotgun going off it's

3853.44 --> 3856.44
fireworks

3883.28 --> 3887.2000000000003
a relative density there's still an open

3885.839 --> 3891.68
yeah the

3887.2 --> 3891.68
p p j c net yes

3892.079 --> 3897.3590000000004
i i j sorry i don't see what the problem

3895.039 --> 3898.7200000000003
is with relative density there is an up

3897.359 --> 3901.839
and a down

3898.72 --> 3901.839
yeah there is

3905.039 --> 3909.44
yeah there's an up and a down in

3907.119 --> 3912.0
euclidean space concerning relative

3909.44 --> 3915.2000000000003
density

3912.0 --> 3917.839
yeah the disequilibrium

3915.2 --> 3919.4399999999996
will cause an object versus the medium

3917.839 --> 3922.48
to either go up

3919.44 --> 3924.7200000000003
or down depending on the nature of the

3922.48 --> 3926.319
density differential if it's less dense

3924.72 --> 3930.3999999999996
it's going to go up

3926.319 --> 3930.4
if it's denser it is going to go down

3930.799 --> 3936.2
in euclidean space and that's just how

3933.119 --> 3936.2000000000003
it works

3944.0 --> 3949.76
not sure the explains the why

3947.2 --> 3952.24
what you need

3949.76 --> 3956.2400000000002
who gives a [ __ ] why

3952.24 --> 3958.0
who gives a [ __ ] rubber digital why

3956.24 --> 3960.8799999999997
we know it does

3958.0 --> 3963.88
who cares why

3960.88 --> 3963.88
yeah

3964.48 --> 3967.119
who cares

3967.2 --> 3972.96
we know how it works

3969.68 --> 3975.2799999999997
who gives a [ __ ] why

3972.96 --> 3977.76
what you need some stupid conceptual

3975.28 --> 3980.559
unprovable reason as to why because you

3977.76 --> 3982.7200000000003
can't very manipulate anything about it

3980.559 --> 3985.119
you can't very manipulate the why we

3982.72 --> 3989.1189999999997
don't know why it doesn't matter what

3985.119 --> 3992.6800000000003
matters is that we know what

3989.119 --> 3992.6800000000003
and how

3996.16 --> 4002.24
oh i don't fully understand it oh so you

3999.2 --> 4005.1189999999997
assume that you can fully understand

4002.24 --> 4008.24
everything do you robert digital you do

4005.119 --> 4011.28
you think you can understand everything

4008.24 --> 4014.8799999999997
you seem to assume that you can attain

4011.28 --> 4018.48
godly oversight over everything

4014.88 --> 4021.7200000000003
which is extremely arrogant and idiotic

4018.48 --> 4021.72
and unrealistic

4026.559 --> 4030.079
we know how

4028.319 --> 4033.0389999999998
we know what

4030.079 --> 4036.96
who gives a [ __ ] why

4033.039 --> 4040.96
who gives a [ __ ]

4036.96 --> 4040.96
we know what and how

4042.48 --> 4046.76
more

4043.52 --> 4046.7599999999998
than enough

4050.319 --> 4055.2
yeah it's like who gives a [ __ ] about

4053.119 --> 4058.4
how you're gonna string a bunch of that

4055.2 --> 4061.2
together in some pattern so you can feel

4058.4 --> 4064.0
like you're god like you're the designer

4061.2 --> 4067.4399999999996
of everything you're not

4064.0 --> 4070.64
you're just a [ __ ] human being

4067.44 --> 4074.88
in the pale shadow of the designer and

4070.64 --> 4074.8799999999997
whatever he throws at you yeah

4075.28 --> 4081.44
you're not the designer

4078.88 --> 4084.96
you understand

4081.44 --> 4086.7200000000003
you don't have to know why you just have

4084.96 --> 4088.96
to know what

4086.72 --> 4091.9199999999996
and how

4088.96 --> 4095.44
that's what you need to know

4091.92 --> 4096.319
yeah that's data that's data that lives

4095.44 --> 4098.159
on

4096.319 --> 4100.88
forever

4098.159 --> 4103.2789999999995
and then in the future that data can be

4100.88 --> 4106.159000000001
used from another perspective because

4103.279 --> 4109.120000000001
it's still true because it's data yeah

4106.159 --> 4112.719
your conceptual vision and how it's

4109.12 --> 4114.64
going to tie together in your temporary

4112.719 --> 4117.12
position of view

4114.64 --> 4120.159000000001
is a pointless endeavor

4117.12 --> 4122.5599999999995
it's a pipe dream it's useless it's

4120.159 --> 4124.719
probably going to turn out to be wrong

4122.56 --> 4126.080000000001
especially if it's not empirical in

4124.719 --> 4127.199
nature

4126.08 --> 4130.96
yeah

4127.199 --> 4134.639999999999
it's useless it's a pipe dream

4130.96 --> 4135.839
why why why why yeah

4134.64 --> 4137.839
it's called

4135.839 --> 4140.4
whining

4137.839 --> 4141.44
you understand

4140.4 --> 4142.719
why

4141.44 --> 4146.5199999999995
ning

4142.719 --> 4146.52
that's what that is

4158.4 --> 4161.4
uh

4170.319 --> 4174.64
rename relative yet it doesn't have a

4172.48 --> 4177.919999999999
downward bias from the grave you

4174.64 --> 4177.92
ignorant [ __ ]

4178.159 --> 4182.96
why don't you stop

4179.679 --> 4186.88
[ __ ] strawmanning everything

4182.96 --> 4189.759
stop raping the meaning of words

4186.88 --> 4192.400000000001
stop inserting

4189.759 --> 4195.28
[ __ ] in there that doesn't belong there

4192.4 --> 4199.12
from the grave you ass

4195.28 --> 4202.48
it doesn't have a downward bias it isn't

4199.12 --> 4205.04
gravity you understand [ __ ]

4202.48 --> 4205.04
it isn't

4206.88 --> 4211.36
there is no downward bias

4210.239 --> 4212.959999999999
there is

4211.36 --> 4215.839999999999
an axis

4212.96 --> 4216.88
of relative density

4215.84 --> 4219.6
force

4216.88 --> 4223.1990000000005
influence directions

4219.6 --> 4226.8
not a downward bias

4223.199 --> 4228.799999999999
up and down depending on the relation

4226.8 --> 4232.719
between the density of the object and

4228.8 --> 4232.719
the medium and that is it

4232.8 --> 4240.1990000000005
not a downward bias not gravity you

4236.4 --> 4240.199
understand dick

4283.84 --> 4286.84
hey

4295.6 --> 4299.4400000000005
the one

4297.44 --> 4301.04
disadvantage of these drinks is that

4299.44 --> 4303.599999999999
they run out

4301.04 --> 4306.719
eventually

4303.6 --> 4309.679
it's such good stuff

4306.719 --> 4311.52
and it feels good on the stomach too

4309.679 --> 4312.84
even though it does have like

4311.52 --> 4316.719
carbon in

4312.84 --> 4316.719
it it is fizzy

4319.12 --> 4322.199
all right

4338.32 --> 4344.5599999999995
yeah so again from the grave not

4340.719 --> 4346.4
responding let's not rename it gravity

4344.56 --> 4349.679
because it isn't gravity and it doesn't

4346.4 --> 4349.679
have a downward bias

4350.239 --> 4354.08
like your false suggestion

4355.44 --> 4361.599999999999
yeah so stop straw manning

4359.199 --> 4364.0
physics and how it works

4361.6 --> 4365.679
actual physics that has an empirical

4364.0 --> 4369.48
nature it's not just

4365.679 --> 4369.4800000000005
conceptual assertions

4405.52 --> 4410.120000000001
is everybody on lunch break or something

4422.96 --> 4427.52
yeah etymology is great i love etymology

4426.159 --> 4431.599999999999
i use it

4427.52 --> 4434.080000000001
that's how i assign the word holographic

4431.6 --> 4436.159000000001
to the celestial lights

4434.08 --> 4438.84
yeah

4436.159 --> 4442.639999999999
i was able to determine

4438.84 --> 4446.0
that with relative precision

4442.64 --> 4449.84
thanks to being trained in etymology as

4446.0 --> 4452.08
a kid by my parents a lot constantly

4449.84 --> 4454.400000000001
constantly every time a freaking word

4452.08 --> 4456.64
came up it was always like hey where did

4454.4 --> 4458.159
that come from

4456.64 --> 4461.76
like what

4458.159 --> 4463.839999999999
language roots did that have how did

4461.76 --> 4466.2390000000005
they come up with it

4463.84 --> 4468.56
in what historical time frame

4466.239 --> 4472.159
was the word being used right

4468.56 --> 4474.0
constantly i don't remember the details

4472.159 --> 4476.239
as in like i'm not

4474.0 --> 4479.04
a memorization guy that can now like a

4476.239 --> 4482.799999999999
book work just say oh it's that word

4479.04 --> 4485.44
from that date and that country

4482.8 --> 4488.88
but i know it's there

4485.44 --> 4491.04
and i know it matters

4488.88 --> 4493.92
that's the difference

4491.04 --> 4497.239
and i have like a subconscious memory of

4493.92 --> 4497.2390000000005
all of it

4505.28 --> 4510.08
worth having a conversation with no no

4508.159 --> 4513.28
not really

4510.08 --> 4518.159
i mean a conversation does not entail

4513.28 --> 4518.159
inserting straw man assertions

4518.96 --> 4523.199
breaking models

4521.44 --> 4525.678999999999
of other people

4523.199 --> 4526.879999999999
and then inserting false suggestions

4525.679 --> 4528.64
yeah

4526.88 --> 4531.12
and that's not having a conversation

4528.64 --> 4533.280000000001
that's us responding to a

4531.12 --> 4536.679
psychological assault

4533.28 --> 4536.679
on your account

4539.36 --> 4543.32
that's not having a conversation

4562.64 --> 4567.8
besides they're still steamy travelers

4564.56 --> 4567.8
still here

4568.719 --> 4571.92
oh i had a pretty good question earlier

4570.56 --> 4574.4800000000005
that i forgot

4571.92 --> 4576.4800000000005
i overlooked that how do clouds stay up

4574.48 --> 4578.5599999999995
in the sky that always confuses me yeah

4576.48 --> 4580.5599999999995
it is confusing it's very complicated

4578.56 --> 4582.0
how that works

4580.56 --> 4583.6
has to do with the temperature

4582.0 --> 4584.96
differential

4583.6 --> 4587.360000000001
versus the

4584.96 --> 4589.6
condensation

4587.36 --> 4594.5199999999995
conditions

4589.6 --> 4594.52
and freezing conditions for water

4594.88 --> 4602.400000000001
it's meteorology and it's like really

4598.08 --> 4604.96
bizarre how elaborate it really is

4602.4 --> 4606.159
right so what's happening is

4604.96 --> 4607.84
water

4606.159 --> 4609.839999999999
on the ground level

4607.84 --> 4611.4400000000005
evaporates into

4609.84 --> 4613.679
moist

4611.44 --> 4615.678999999999
into water vapor

4613.679 --> 4618.719
it rises

4615.679 --> 4620.88
it will keep rising typically with by

4618.719 --> 4622.4
the way the rest of the air as well

4620.88 --> 4624.400000000001
mix in

4622.4 --> 4627.5199999999995
kind of hang in there

4624.4 --> 4630.48
and then at some point it might hit

4627.52 --> 4632.88
a temperature level up there

4630.48 --> 4636.5599999999995
where suddenly

4632.88 --> 4637.84
if there's enough percentage of moist in

4636.56 --> 4641.1990000000005
the air

4637.84 --> 4644.400000000001
dissolved into it as water vapor that it

4641.199 --> 4646.719
will kind of start to condensate in the

4644.4 --> 4646.719
spot

4647.199 --> 4652.48
right and turn back into well water

4650.0 --> 4654.0
droplets but the droplets will be so

4652.48 --> 4656.879999999999
small

4654.0 --> 4657.92
that they will effectively be

4656.88 --> 4658.96
carried

4657.92 --> 4661.4400000000005
by

4658.96 --> 4662.56
the natural heat rise so they will kind

4661.44 --> 4666.12
of be

4662.56 --> 4669.280000000001
super slowly falling while the air is

4666.12 --> 4670.8
simultaneously moving super slowly up

4669.28 --> 4672.48
and that's how they kind of stay in

4670.8 --> 4673.6
place

4672.48 --> 4675.28
right

4673.6 --> 4677.76
if they'd move

4675.28 --> 4680.0
down quicker because it was getting top

4677.76 --> 4683.280000000001
heavy and the droplets would be

4680.0 --> 4686.0
slightly bigger the micro droplets that

4683.28 --> 4688.639999999999
clouds could look basically are

4686.0 --> 4690.64
then if it moves slowly downward it

4688.64 --> 4694.88
would

4690.64 --> 4696.96
basically start to dissolve back into

4694.88 --> 4698.32
water vapor again

4696.96 --> 4701.6
because it

4698.32 --> 4702.639999999999
moves into the warmer part of the air

4701.6 --> 4704.84
and it then

4702.64 --> 4708.2390000000005
basically starts evaporating

4704.84 --> 4710.32
back and that's how it kind of stays in

4708.239 --> 4712.0
that specific region

4710.32 --> 4714.0
depending on the the temperature

4712.0 --> 4716.08
division in the air because that can too

4714.0 --> 4718.159
change right it can be pretty cold at

4716.08 --> 4720.8
ground level and then suddenly clouds

4718.159 --> 4722.799999999999
will literally form very low right so it

4720.8 --> 4726.0
all depends on how the temperature is

4722.8 --> 4729.12
divided in the current moment in the air

4726.0 --> 4731.199
where the cloud critical momentum where

4729.12 --> 4734.32
it will turn into water droplets and

4731.199 --> 4736.159
where it will turn back into water vapor

4734.32 --> 4738.5599999999995
right and that's completely separate

4736.159 --> 4740.96
from how rain forms which is even more

4738.56 --> 4742.4800000000005
complicated

4740.96 --> 4744.8
because then

4742.48 --> 4748.239
it'll have to get even colder

4744.8 --> 4751.4400000000005
start to form ice

4748.239 --> 4753.12
and then the ice which is heavy very

4751.44 --> 4754.32
heavy compared like it doesn't really

4753.12 --> 4756.719
matter

4754.32 --> 4758.719
it's much bigger than just the micro

4756.719 --> 4759.92
water droplets of which a cloud consists

4758.719 --> 4762.64
of

4759.92 --> 4764.96
can build up they will fall

4762.64 --> 4766.56
and then eventually hit the warmer

4764.96 --> 4769.199
temperature but it will still have

4766.56 --> 4771.52
momentum right because it's a solid then

4769.199 --> 4773.199
turns a liquid still has the momentum of

4771.52 --> 4775.6
falling

4773.199 --> 4778.08
so it doesn't really dissolve enough

4775.6 --> 4780.96
back into the air and that's how water

4778.08 --> 4784.08
droplets then reached the ground level

4780.96 --> 4787.76
it was actually a piece of ice

4784.08 --> 4790.4
that collected in a cloud fell down

4787.76 --> 4793.1990000000005
warmed up back into water and but not

4790.4 --> 4795.5199999999995
enough to basically make it evaporate

4793.199 --> 4795.5199999999995
again

4797.04 --> 4800.96
and then it hit the ground

4799.12 --> 4804.08
in

4800.96 --> 4805.84
yeah as water as a droplet so there you

4804.08 --> 4808.639
go what the [ __ ] are you doing why are

4805.84 --> 4808.639
you typing him out

4811.84 --> 4815.12
what are you doing canada bear

4816.159 --> 4820.799999999999
i was literally addressing something he

4818.639 --> 4822.639
said

4820.8 --> 4825.28
no i wasn't by the way i was addressing

4822.639 --> 4827.52
something what am i saying

4825.28 --> 4829.92
i was addressing

4827.52 --> 4831.679
steamy traveler

4829.92 --> 4834.719
but yeah

4831.679 --> 4836.719
don't do that

4834.719 --> 4839.28
oh hey the wrench works yeah there's a

4836.719 --> 4842.679
thing about it though can a bear

4839.28 --> 4842.679
there's rules

4847.6 --> 4850.719
and yeah

4849.6 --> 4853.76
use it

4850.719 --> 4856.32
only when pretty much there's no other

4853.76 --> 4859.12
option like somebody's like savagely

4856.32 --> 4861.679
spamming or getting super vile but i

4859.12 --> 4864.08
mean super vile not just

4861.679 --> 4865.52
being an annoying anti-flat earther like

4864.08 --> 4866.719
that's not enough reason to time

4865.52 --> 4869.280000000001
somebody out

4866.719 --> 4871.12
unless they're like very noticeably

4869.28 --> 4873.36
spamming

4871.12 --> 4876.96
so please

4873.36 --> 4879.599999999999
use your wrench very sparingly it's very

4876.96 --> 4882.88
disruptive if you time out anti-flat

4879.6 --> 4887.4800000000005
earther or globbers in my chat

4882.88 --> 4887.4800000000005
just because they're kind of an ass

4890.719 --> 4893.719
so

4915.28 --> 4917.84
yep

4932.08 --> 4936.8
there can a beard word

4934.159 --> 4940.199
please don't use the wrench on ballers

4936.8 --> 4940.1990000000005
in my chat

4953.84 --> 4959.0
all right anyway hello getting wisdom by

4955.92 --> 4959.0
the way

4964.96 --> 4969.88
got a whole bunch of people in this chat

4966.88 --> 4969.88
here

4972.56 --> 4978.719
even though according to the

4974.0 --> 4978.719
participants list it's three people

4979.52 --> 4983.88
it's just three people here

4987.12 --> 4991.679
i guess tara 306 is not a person

4997.44 --> 5002.32
slo-mo moon buggy is not a person

5000.48 --> 5005.28
wrath is not a person

5002.32 --> 5008.32
matthew hall isn't the person

5005.28 --> 5011.5199999999995
robert digital isn't that person

5008.32 --> 5011.5199999999995
the [ __ ] is up with that

5011.679 --> 5016.4
candy bear is not a person

5013.84 --> 5016.400000000001
according

5016.719 --> 5023.12
to the participant list in the chat

5020.639 --> 5027.0
oh canada bear is now a person

5023.12 --> 5027.0
oh a slo-mo moon buggy

5028.239 --> 5032.638999999999
it's yeah the participant list is like

5030.56 --> 5034.88
what the hell man what's the point of

5032.639 --> 5034.88
that

5036.48 --> 5041.36
like it only seems to just show anybody

5039.28 --> 5044.239
if they spoke up in like in the last

5041.36 --> 5044.239
minute or something

5053.84 --> 5057.679
what's the difference between a cloud

5055.6 --> 5061.6
and a fog

5057.679 --> 5061.6
well there isn't much difference

5062.32 --> 5067.599999999999
except that the cloud is usually in a

5064.56 --> 5067.6
colder temperature

5067.76 --> 5073.1990000000005
it has bigger droplets because a fog is

5071.92 --> 5075.4400000000005
basically a

5073.199 --> 5078.48
cloud to ground level but it's going to

5075.44 --> 5082.28
be in different conditions

5078.48 --> 5082.28
as a cloud up there

5089.6 --> 5094.400000000001
length of time what the [ __ ] from the

5092.08 --> 5096.719
grave i already said don't use the

5094.4 --> 5096.719
wrench

5097.52 --> 5103.84
length of time you can't set the length

5100.4 --> 5105.92
of a timeout from the grave it's five

5103.84 --> 5108.0
minutes there's nothing anybody could do

5105.92 --> 5110.8
to change that you can't regulate how

5108.0 --> 5113.84
long a timeout lasts

5110.8 --> 5113.84
the [ __ ] is

5142.159 --> 5146.638999999999
good point by the way those

5144.56 --> 5148.719
those spamming bots

5146.639 --> 5151.76
from those well what

5148.719 --> 5154.159
some people say are porn related sites i

5151.76 --> 5155.92
don't know i've never checked it once

5154.159 --> 5158.48
right because that's the only way you

5155.92 --> 5161.4400000000005
truly defeat it by literally not even

5158.48 --> 5164.638999999999
knowing what they're linking to

5161.44 --> 5166.48
yeah is just delete like never look

5164.639 --> 5169.36
never let it touch

5166.48 --> 5172.718999999999
any conscious surface just like

5169.36 --> 5172.719
you don't exist

5172.88 --> 5175.6
if you do that

5175.76 --> 5182.88
then it cannot influence you secretly

5180.159 --> 5185.199
but yeah people said their

5182.88 --> 5189.04
porn related website links and they have

5185.199 --> 5189.04
stopped they have stopped for a while

5193.12 --> 5199.84
i think in retrospect it was probably

5195.679 --> 5199.84
related to the whole ukraine hype

5200.0 --> 5203.52
is making people squirt

5204.159 --> 5209.5199999999995
sounds kind of silly like that but i

5206.08 --> 5211.76
think that it actually was related

5209.52 --> 5213.92
they never just unleash those types of

5211.76 --> 5217.159000000001
things without cause right without a

5213.92 --> 5217.159
good reason

5227.44 --> 5232.4
hackers trying to log onto your machine

5229.76 --> 5235.12
if you click the links

5232.4 --> 5235.12
probably

5235.679 --> 5240.96
i don't know

5236.88 --> 5240.96
i don't care i've never tried it out

5249.679 --> 5253.4800000000005
hello glad flobe

5264.48 --> 5271.28
russia banned facebook cool

5268.96 --> 5271.28
good

5272.159 --> 5277.44
in my personal opinion the entirety of

5275.04 --> 5279.199
facebook should be erased

5277.44 --> 5281.5199999999995
all of it

5279.199 --> 5285.759999999999
yeah because everything that's on there

5281.52 --> 5290.639
is like confiscated personal data anyway

5285.76 --> 5290.639
should just be deleted just full wipe

5291.52 --> 5293.76
bye

5293.84 --> 5298.0
yeah i know you've had really great

5295.76 --> 5300.320000000001
conversations it's really cute if it was

5298.0 --> 5302.48
actually worth it and not just a

5300.32 --> 5304.88
learning moment for you

5302.48 --> 5308.32
then you should have stored what was so

5304.88 --> 5310.2390000000005
valuable on your computer or reposted it

5308.32 --> 5313.36
somewhere else

5310.239 --> 5317.879999999999
facebook should be completely wiped the

5313.36 --> 5317.88
entire thing in my opinion

5322.8 --> 5327.1990000000005
and mark zuckerberg freaking arrested

5327.92 --> 5333.96
he's a sick little grabbler anyway what

5330.719 --> 5333.96
an [ __ ]

5340.08 --> 5344.76
it's a freaky little grabbler [ __ ]

5351.04 --> 5353.92
face back

5355.04 --> 5357.36
dude

5361.04 --> 5364.96
now

5363.199 --> 5368.32
i think it would be better if facebook

5364.96 --> 5368.32
was completely wiped

5368.48 --> 5372.959999999999
and then who knows maybe you could

5371.04 --> 5376.159
restart it

5372.96 --> 5378.4
with a more sensible policy where not

5376.159 --> 5381.759999999999
all the data is confiscated

5378.4 --> 5385.12
to do with whatever the owner wants

5381.76 --> 5387.92
the owner of the company right

5385.12 --> 5390.32
and yeah if facebook can re be

5387.92 --> 5391.36
reinvented like that then i'd be like oh

5390.32 --> 5393.12
well

5391.36 --> 5395.44
sure

5393.12 --> 5398.88
but the way it's set up and it has been

5395.44 --> 5402.48
set up the entire thing should be 100

5398.88 --> 5404.159000000001
data wiped just completely erased

5402.48 --> 5407.919999999999
like hard

5404.159 --> 5409.44
wipe you know you can wipe it a hard

5407.92 --> 5410.719
disk

5409.44 --> 5413.28
and then

5410.719 --> 5415.52
like it's just like no it's just set to

5413.28 --> 5417.759999999999
you can write over it whatever you want

5415.52 --> 5419.360000000001
the data's still there well i think that

5417.76 --> 5421.84
the entirety of facebook should be

5419.36 --> 5425.28
hardwired or literally like no every

5421.84 --> 5428.159000000001
part of data is like permanently erased

5425.28 --> 5428.159
that's what i think

5431.36 --> 5439.92
because oh it's just being abused it's

5434.48 --> 5443.879999999999
it's data abuse facebook is data abuse

5439.92 --> 5443.88
if there ever was any

5449.84 --> 5455.04
the data wipe is coming well with

5452.32 --> 5459.96
facebook it should but

5455.04 --> 5459.96
not necessarily with other things

5471.04 --> 5476.76
people who see facebook as the internet

5473.28 --> 5476.759999999999
yeah they're [ __ ]

5477.36 --> 5482.32
like those people are [ __ ] and it

5480.48 --> 5483.12
would be good for them to snap out of

5482.32 --> 5486.0
that

5483.12 --> 5486.0
once and for all

5488.159 --> 5491.839999999999
everything they do is going to be wasted

5492.48 --> 5497.12
it kind of already is right if it was

5495.04 --> 5498.32
that important again then you should

5497.12 --> 5500.96
have

5498.32 --> 5504.159
put it on your computer

5500.96 --> 5506.08
and perhaps repost it somewhere else

5504.159 --> 5508.48
that isn't facebook and if you haven't

5506.08 --> 5511.199
done that yeah then you deserve

5508.48 --> 5513.759999999999
how many of hundreds of thousands of

5511.199 --> 5515.759999999999
hours you spent on that

5513.76 --> 5518.92
and monies but you have you deserve to

5515.76 --> 5518.92
have that

5518.96 --> 5524.159
gone irrevocably forever because you're

5521.76 --> 5526.56
a [ __ ] idiot if you've done

5524.159 --> 5528.719
everything on facebook your entire life

5526.56 --> 5531.6
and nothing else

5528.719 --> 5533.76
you are an idiot i don't care what your

5531.6 --> 5537.2390000000005
age category is

5533.76 --> 5537.2390000000005
you're an idiot

5556.8 --> 5560.88
that makes no sense you're literally

5558.88 --> 5564.679
contradicting yourself in the same

5560.88 --> 5564.679
sentence from the grave

5582.88 --> 5588.4800000000005
do i have all my youtube videos back no

5585.92 --> 5590.96
no i don't most of it will be erased

5588.48 --> 5593.199
forever

5590.96 --> 5595.92
alright steamy traveler

5593.199 --> 5596.719
i can't back it up i refuse to back it

5595.92 --> 5598.639
up

5596.719 --> 5600.8
if somebody wants to back it up because

5598.639 --> 5603.04
they really think every every moment of

5600.8 --> 5605.1990000000005
what i've done is precious

5603.04 --> 5606.239
then i'd applaud that i'd be very

5605.199 --> 5611.919999999999
thankful

5606.239 --> 5614.32
i don't have the [ __ ] money to do it

5611.92 --> 5614.32
all right

5631.36 --> 5636.639
so yeah i got all my flatter talks

5634.32 --> 5638.159
and i got everything else i need right

5636.639 --> 5640.639
there

5638.159 --> 5642.638999999999
if it was completely wiped and youtube

5640.639 --> 5645.04
was completely erased well there would

5642.639 --> 5646.2390000000005
be more [ __ ] than just little old

5645.04 --> 5649.5199999999995
arwin

5646.239 --> 5652.0
the world would be [ __ ]

5649.52 --> 5653.84
if it's all white

5652.0 --> 5657.12
[ __ ] like

5653.84 --> 5660.32
absolutely [ __ ] beyond repair

5657.12 --> 5662.8
if youtube is completely wiped

5660.32 --> 5666.719
youtube is very different

5662.8 --> 5666.719
compared to facebook it is

5670.96 --> 5673.84
you can do that

5677.04 --> 5680.96
if you want

5678.8 --> 5682.2390000000005
but yeah you're not

5680.96 --> 5685.04
just do that

5682.239 --> 5686.959999999999
you know i don't care

5685.04 --> 5688.88
i mean pretty sure in the future like

5686.96 --> 5691.119
you can even edit [ __ ]

5688.88 --> 5694.159000000001
and then say oh look this is the

5691.119 --> 5696.639
original and then people can just like

5694.159 --> 5700.08
take your image that's edited and then

5696.639 --> 5702.8
literally get the original from it

5700.08 --> 5702.8
by that time

5704.08 --> 5708.239
so i don't care

5705.92 --> 5709.6
like i don't care if it's a race i don't

5708.239 --> 5712.959999999999
care if

5709.6 --> 5715.52
1200 early bird shows are deleted i

5712.96 --> 5718.96
don't care you hear me

5715.52 --> 5720.8
if that happens it happens i don't have

5718.96 --> 5722.4800000000005
the [ __ ] money

5720.8 --> 5724.56
to store that all

5722.48 --> 5727.5199999999995
and i can literally just

5724.56 --> 5729.92
do it all over again all of it

5727.52 --> 5732.0
spontaneously i've never planned

5729.92 --> 5735.04
anything out there's no

5732.0 --> 5738.08
hyper unique moments because it's all

5735.04 --> 5742.08
unique all of it is because the moment

5738.08 --> 5744.159
itself is unique and it becomes unique

5742.08 --> 5745.679
again

5744.159 --> 5749.04
yeah

5745.679 --> 5751.119
i could do it all over again all of it

5749.04 --> 5753.76
the only thing that really mattered

5751.119 --> 5755.119
anyway was the flat earth talks that's

5753.76 --> 5758.96
where the

5755.119 --> 5761.92
the the roots of the ideas sprung up for

5758.96 --> 5765.36
the first time in a raw form that's what

5761.92 --> 5768.96
really matters those episodes i have i

5765.36 --> 5771.119
have them all i have them burned to dvd

5768.96 --> 5772.8
even

5771.119 --> 5775.119
my computer like

5772.8 --> 5778.0
fries or something like those aren't

5775.119 --> 5778.0
gonna get lost

5778.639 --> 5784.56
but yeah i don't have room

5781.199 --> 5787.5199999999995
or the money for flat earth early bird

5784.56 --> 5788.56
archives i don't

5787.52 --> 5790.639
yeah

5788.56 --> 5793.52
if you want me to have that i'm gonna

5790.639 --> 5795.52
like need a couple of hundred more euros

5793.52 --> 5797.4400000000005
in donations each month

5795.52 --> 5799.84
yeah and then i could

5797.44 --> 5802.159
maybe maneuver to that position

5799.84 --> 5804.56
eventually

5802.159 --> 5809.32
right now i'm still concerned just about

5804.56 --> 5809.320000000001
eating that hasn't really changed

5829.04 --> 5834.159
yeah so it's up to you guys it's up to

5831.6 --> 5837.52
you how how valuable

5834.159 --> 5838.799999999999
you really think what i do is

5837.52 --> 5841.119000000001
you want

5838.8 --> 5843.52
all these early bird shows to be stored

5841.119 --> 5845.759999999999
and safeguarded for some

5843.52 --> 5851.040000000001
general internet wipe

5845.76 --> 5853.679
then you make it happen because i can't

5851.04 --> 5856.8
you understand i'm not in the position

5853.679 --> 5856.8
to be able to do that

5863.36 --> 5867.0
yeah kind of bear

5881.92 --> 5886.96
ai backs it up for free well i i hope so

5885.76 --> 5889.119000000001
wrath

5886.96 --> 5892.679
does it though

5889.119 --> 5892.679
that would be cool

5897.92 --> 5902.88
although i wonder what that actually

5900.159 --> 5902.879999999999
means though

5906.96 --> 5911.119
like where where is that going to be

5908.8 --> 5914.159000000001
backed up like there is too much

5911.119 --> 5915.36
information in existence to back it all

5914.159 --> 5918.638999999999
up

5915.36 --> 5920.799999999999
right it's exponentially growing

5918.639 --> 5922.96
every second

5920.8 --> 5925.679
you understand it's not linearly

5922.96 --> 5927.76
building it's exponentially building

5925.679 --> 5929.36
pretty much every second there's too

5927.76 --> 5933.04
much data

5929.36 --> 5936.5199999999995
in existence to properly record it all

5933.04 --> 5936.5199999999995
it's just this

5949.199 --> 5953.839999999999
yeah that could be sean but i don't care

5957.199 --> 5961.28
tech illiterate

5958.88 --> 5961.28
all right

5962.239 --> 5966.959999999999
the digital world is the future no it's

5964.88 --> 5970.2390000000005
not

5966.96 --> 5970.2390000000005
what an idiot

5974.96 --> 5982.32
just no no it's not

5979.04 --> 5985.28
yeah that's like saying oh man

5982.32 --> 5987.679
hard drugs dude that's the future

5985.28 --> 5989.599999999999
no it's not

5987.679 --> 5992.4
it's pointless it's just another

5989.6 --> 5996.96
distraction the only real future is the

5992.4 --> 5996.96
physical world is the physical skills

5997.36 --> 6004.5599999999995
the only

5999.199 --> 6006.719
real future is the roots that we have

6004.56 --> 6009.1990000000005
whatever is left of it that's the real

6006.719 --> 6013.199
future not the digital world the digital

6009.199 --> 6015.919999999999
world is just a communication device

6013.199 --> 6018.4
it makes information

6015.92 --> 6020.4800000000005
connect quicker yeah

6018.4 --> 6022.4
that information is still derived from

6020.48 --> 6024.718999999999
the physical world

6022.4 --> 6027.44
without the physical world

6024.719 --> 6030.4
the digital world becomes completely

6027.44 --> 6034.159
pointless and in an abyss

6030.4 --> 6037.44
yeah nothing a void

6034.159 --> 6041.96
it's not the future the future is the

6037.44 --> 6041.96
roots in the physical world

6059.119 --> 6064.239
how big is each file

6061.119 --> 6065.44
well i've stored some of my shows in

6064.239 --> 6066.959999999999
like

6065.44 --> 6072.04
what is it

6066.96 --> 6072.04
200 to 300 megabyte files

6080.08 --> 6084.8
so that yeah so that there is a proper

6082.32 --> 6084.799999999999
quality

6087.76 --> 6092.719
and who knows maybe you could do that

6090.239 --> 6095.5199999999995
super much more efficient yeah that's

6092.719 --> 6098.719
cute i can't

6095.52 --> 6101.119000000001
you want to do it do it

6098.719 --> 6103.199
and mail me the hard disk that would be

6101.119 --> 6104.96
great if you can get it all

6103.199 --> 6106.799999999999
fitted on one hard disk that would be

6104.96 --> 6109.04
epic

6106.8 --> 6110.8
i can't make it fit like that

6109.04 --> 6113.36
and i don't have the time or the

6110.8 --> 6116.639
patience to to do it manually the way

6113.36 --> 6118.5599999999995
i've done it like with the

6116.639 --> 6121.679
with the flatter talk shows right

6118.56 --> 6123.04
because that took me hours and hours and

6121.679 --> 6125.119
it sucked

6123.04 --> 6127.679
and had to redo a whole bunch because it

6125.119 --> 6129.04
just gave unexpected like oh we can't we

6127.679 --> 6131.52
just can't do it

6129.04 --> 6133.6
just like this episode yeah just doesn't

6131.52 --> 6136.2390000000005
work like why

6133.6 --> 6140.400000000001
no it just doesn't work oh great that's

6136.239 --> 6140.4
just great yeah unpredictable

6141.44 --> 6145.44
i don't want to do it

6143.6 --> 6146.719
it's too much

6145.44 --> 6150.239
it took me

6146.719 --> 6152.88
like hours and hours and hours

6150.239 --> 6155.36
to even do it with my

6152.88 --> 6159.28
flatter talk shows and that's what is it

6155.36 --> 6159.28
like 60 episodes or something

6161.679 --> 6164.719
let me see how much

6165.52 --> 6170.080000000001
letter talks all playlists

6171.84 --> 6176.119000000001
51 videos right

6181.28 --> 6184.28
so

6196.159 --> 6203.28
google drive can be oh yay

6200.239 --> 6204.638999999999
that's super cute

6203.28 --> 6208.08
i mean

6204.639 --> 6209.4400000000005
just give it into the hands of a mega

6208.08 --> 6212.239
corporation

6209.44 --> 6214.32
for free i mean mega corporations give

6212.239 --> 6215.759999999999
you things for free it's not like you

6214.32 --> 6218.799999999999
risk

6215.76 --> 6222.159000000001
getting influence in some unforeseen way

6218.8 --> 6222.159000000001
or anything right

6222.96 --> 6226.8
yeah if i wanted to start on google

6225.28 --> 6228.4
drive

6226.8 --> 6230.96
then

6228.4 --> 6234.239
makes no sense like it literally makes

6230.96 --> 6235.44
no sense like why would i do that

6234.239 --> 6238.239
i could just

6235.44 --> 6241.199
if i could just leave it on youtube

6238.239 --> 6243.04
right it's the same company

6241.199 --> 6244.96
what's the difference in like oh i gotta

6243.04 --> 6246.4
download it and put it all on google

6244.96 --> 6247.679
drive

6246.4 --> 6249.679
uh

6247.679 --> 6251.76
well i take it that if

6249.679 --> 6253.76
youtube's gonna get wiped it's a great

6251.76 --> 6256.159000000001
likelihood that google drive is gonna

6253.76 --> 6259.4800000000005
get wiped as well duh

6256.159 --> 6259.48
come on

6286.56 --> 6289.56
god

6290.8 --> 6295.119000000001
do you look directly into someone you

6292.8 --> 6297.1990000000005
don't literally by the words that you

6295.119 --> 6299.5199999999995
use it proves you don't know what the

6297.199 --> 6301.44
hell you're talking about from the grave

6299.52 --> 6303.280000000001
nice try though

6301.44 --> 6305.5199999999995
i do believe that at some point there

6303.28 --> 6308.4
will be a device

6305.52 --> 6310.56
that can read your brain and literally

6308.4 --> 6312.719
print out

6310.56 --> 6315.320000000001
a digital image

6312.719 --> 6318.56
based exactly on what you've

6315.32 --> 6322.08
envisualized in your brain

6318.56 --> 6322.080000000001
that part i do think exists

6329.04 --> 6333.76
yeah steamy traveler that's nice go and

6331.28 --> 6335.84

6333.76 --> 6337.679
you understand

6335.84 --> 6340.08
go do it

6337.679 --> 6341.84
i'm not

6340.08 --> 6343.5199999999995
stop telling me

6341.84 --> 6346.719
you go do it

6343.52 --> 6349.6
and you send it to me over the mail and

6346.719 --> 6351.36
i'll be thankful i will be thankful but

6349.6 --> 6354.0
i'm not gonna do that

6351.36 --> 6354.0
you understand

6355.52 --> 6359.92
and i

6356.639 --> 6362.639
kinda hope you're gonna drop it now

6359.92 --> 6364.96
unless you are going to do it yourself

6362.639 --> 6368.0
for me as a surface which i would

6364.96 --> 6368.0
greatly appreciate

6368.32 --> 6372.679
anyway i'll be right back in two minutes

6425.44 --> 6428.44
this

6432.32 --> 6435.32
so

6446.719 --> 6449.719
so

6479.52 --> 6485.119000000001
do i sit down to watch

6481.36 --> 6487.28
any of my old shows

6485.119 --> 6489.599999999999
no

6487.28 --> 6491.92
i'm lucky if i'm watching my show from

6489.6 --> 6494.96
the day before

6491.92 --> 6498.32
i mean sometimes when i feel like i've

6494.96 --> 6501.52
done something that's really good for me

6498.32 --> 6503.759999999999
or like a new level that i want to grow

6501.52 --> 6506.400000000001
towards then i'll watch it i have

6503.76 --> 6507.4400000000005
watched some of my shows

6506.4 --> 6510.638999999999
like

6507.44 --> 6510.638999999999
two or three times

6511.52 --> 6516.159000000001
because i was just really into it at the

6513.84 --> 6516.159000000001
time

6516.4 --> 6519.759999999999
but overall no

6520.08 --> 6524.96
like

6520.88 --> 6527.36
to me guys i don't really need to

6524.96 --> 6530.159
like it doesn't bring me anything to

6527.36 --> 6531.119
watch my old shows back because i'll

6530.159 --> 6532.32
just

6531.119 --> 6535.199
do it

6532.32 --> 6537.599999999999
out of nothing all over again

6535.199 --> 6539.599999999999
whatever needs to manifest i'll just do

6537.6 --> 6542.2390000000005
it right

6539.6 --> 6544.719
those things that were recorded exist

6542.239 --> 6547.839999999999
within me

6544.719 --> 6550.8
it's none of it almost none of it is a

6547.84 --> 6550.8
one-time thing

6550.96 --> 6556.32
i can literally just re-conjure it all

6553.92 --> 6560.84
out of nothing and it will be different

6556.32 --> 6560.84
but it will be different in a good way

6572.239 --> 6578.799999999999
right this is not like

6575.679 --> 6580.4
a hundred thousand hours of

6578.8 --> 6583.52
painstaking

6580.4 --> 6586.159
script reading acting work right it's

6583.52 --> 6588.159000000001
like oh my god i spent so many hours

6586.159 --> 6591.04
thousands and thousands of hours

6588.159 --> 6592.4
memorizing that [ __ ] i could never do it

6591.04 --> 6595.599
over again

6592.4 --> 6597.5199999999995
right because then i'd be like yeah yeah

6595.599 --> 6599.76
i get that that's

6597.52 --> 6601.599
you you want to keep that right

6599.76 --> 6606.2390000000005
i never did that

6601.599 --> 6607.04
i improvise everything everything i do

6606.239 --> 6609.28
so

6607.04 --> 6611.92
it doesn't have like

6609.28 --> 6613.44
thousands and thousands of painstaking

6611.92 --> 6615.1990000000005
hours of work

6613.44 --> 6617.839999999999
like that into it

6615.199 --> 6620.0
that i would need to do over again to

6617.84 --> 6621.52
accomplish the same yeah

6620.0 --> 6624.48
i can literally

6621.52 --> 6626.56
reenact every part of everything i've

6624.48 --> 6630.879999999999
ever done on youtube

6626.56 --> 6634.320000000001
you understand everything i can reenact

6630.88 --> 6637.4400000000005
nothing is lost forever

6634.32 --> 6640.239
it doesn't cost me any time

6637.44 --> 6642.879999999999
to basically re-manifest

6640.239 --> 6642.879999999999
any of it

6650.8 --> 6654.88
you gonna replicate in the future dude

6655.119 --> 6662.48
that's not my problem steamy traveler

6659.36 --> 6665.44
if you wanna think like that

6662.48 --> 6666.4
then yeah by all means record everything

6665.44 --> 6669.28
i do

6666.4 --> 6671.679
for people in the future

6669.28 --> 6673.84
do that yeah

6671.679 --> 6679.639
you do that

6673.84 --> 6679.639
don't try to manipulate me to do that

6701.36 --> 6704.36
do

6723.679 --> 6727.4400000000005
does the rattling of straight answers to

6725.76 --> 6729.76
all their questions in the super funny

6727.44 --> 6731.28
disposition thank you canaver thank you

6729.76 --> 6734.08
yes

6731.28 --> 6736.08
and i do appreciate that

6734.08 --> 6739.04
i appreciate that you take note of that

6736.08 --> 6739.92
yeah the thing is though it's a thing i

6739.04 --> 6743.36
do

6739.92 --> 6745.04
i could just do that right again

6743.36 --> 6747.5199999999995
just like that

6745.04 --> 6749.36
it kind of have to be in the mood for it

6747.52 --> 6751.1990000000005
i have to be like in a really high

6749.36 --> 6752.88
energy mood

6751.199 --> 6755.199
where suddenly

6752.88 --> 6757.1990000000005
troll negativity just bounces off me

6755.199 --> 6760.08
just like that very easily and then i

6757.199 --> 6760.08
could just do that

6761.44 --> 6766.799999999999
and i think that as time is passing i'm

6764.239 --> 6771.4
actually getting in that mood more

6766.8 --> 6771.400000000001
regularly than in the past

6782.4 --> 6786.0
i was the only one in the panel

6784.159 --> 6787.598999999999
basically at that point though yeah i

6786.0 --> 6789.44
know

6787.599 --> 6792.0
well you know like

6789.44 --> 6794.159
it shows that you mentioned 99 to 100

6792.0 --> 6796.32
that's a long time ago that's really at

6794.159 --> 6800.08
the start that's when it was fresh i've

6796.32 --> 6800.08
been doing that ever since

6800.239 --> 6805.04
i started doing that and i'm still doing

6802.88 --> 6810.56
that and now people are kind of used to

6805.04 --> 6813.679
it right just like i manifested ballwin

6810.56 --> 6816.8
which is an encounter part of myself it

6813.679 --> 6816.8
is me from the past

6817.36 --> 6820.96
and it's still there

6819.04 --> 6823.679
i started doing that everybody's like oh

6820.96 --> 6825.76
my god what are you doing and now

6823.679 --> 6828.96
there's other people that are doing it

6825.76 --> 6828.96
themselves like

6829.36 --> 6834.48
that like john

6832.32 --> 6836.0
refracted curvature is doing that for

6834.48 --> 6838.0
himself he's actually quite an

6836.0 --> 6840.639
enthusiast

6838.0 --> 6842.88
even brian brian's logic is doing that a

6840.639 --> 6842.88
bit

6842.96 --> 6848.159
adam meekin is doing it like but at

6845.199 --> 6851.119
first it was like oh my god it's arwin

6848.159 --> 6852.879999999999
stop doing that it's really

6851.119 --> 6855.04
like ugh

6852.88 --> 6857.28
it's gross

6855.04 --> 6859.76
and now they're kind of used to it

6857.28 --> 6861.119
right i started doing that

6859.76 --> 6863.280000000001
it's just the thing i do it's a

6861.119 --> 6866.0
technique on how to deal with it

6863.28 --> 6868.32
and they're now all kind of growing into

6866.0 --> 6868.32
that

6870.4 --> 6873.5199999999995
my puppet voices

6875.36 --> 6878.96
yeah i got many puppet voices

6880.32 --> 6884.719
gamma scored boy voices all of it

6884.8 --> 6888.4400000000005
grabbler voices

6908.0 --> 6913.92
evolving is my second favorite anti flat

6910.8 --> 6913.92
earther next to sean

6915.679 --> 6919.119
i hope there's quite a distance in

6917.76 --> 6921.280000000001
between

6919.119 --> 6923.36
though

6921.28 --> 6925.679
is like sean is not my favorite

6923.36 --> 6928.639
anti-flat earther he's just kind of the

6925.679 --> 6931.36
most annoying anti-flat earther

6928.639 --> 6935.4400000000005
i hope baldwin is not like that i mean

6931.36 --> 6935.44
barwin is kind of like an idealist

6940.8 --> 6946.719
he's like rumpus without the spite

6944.8 --> 6949.04
and egotism

6946.719 --> 6952.52
at least that's what i hope he's coming

6949.04 --> 6952.5199999999995
across as

6971.36 --> 6974.36
hmm

6977.119 --> 6980.96
yeah thanks

6978.639 --> 6983.599
yeah sean is not very funny

6980.96 --> 6984.96
like shawn hawkins is really only funny

6983.599 --> 6989.32
by accident

6984.96 --> 6989.32
he never intends to be funny

6991.76 --> 6998.159000000001
but i'll never forget the one time

6995.76 --> 6999.84
when it was recorded i was sitting there

6998.159 --> 7001.199
as it was happening

6999.84 --> 7003.28
on

7001.199 --> 7004.719
uh google

7003.28 --> 7005.679
google panel

7004.719 --> 7008.719
before

7005.679 --> 7011.679
the way that it works and right now

7008.719 --> 7014.0
the old days where also snipers and all

7011.679 --> 7016.4800000000005
that [ __ ] would happen

7014.0 --> 7019.36
when sean hawkins was like in a

7016.48 --> 7020.799999999999
conversation with rumpus and another guy

7019.36 --> 7022.799999999999
was it kosher

7020.8 --> 7024.8
and kosher or rumpus i think they were

7022.8 --> 7026.639
like having a conversation a technical

7024.8 --> 7029.360000000001
conversation

7026.639 --> 7031.28
and then sean hawkins who was also there

7029.36 --> 7034.159
wanted to get their attention but

7031.28 --> 7038.4
literally rompus and kosho were just

7034.159 --> 7038.4
ignoring him like he didn't exist

7039.119 --> 7042.88
even though

7040.88 --> 7044.8
they could not mute him effectively

7042.88 --> 7047.119
right if you're in the google you can't

7044.8 --> 7050.0
mute the other person even to yourself

7047.119 --> 7052.159
like for example in discord you could do

7050.0 --> 7054.88
something like that

7052.159 --> 7058.0
they didn't they just literally ignored

7054.88 --> 7059.92
him and he started yelling

7058.0 --> 7062.239
hey

7059.92 --> 7064.0
hey

7062.239 --> 7066.5599999999995
hey

7064.0 --> 7068.639
right as rumpus and kosho i think it was

7066.56 --> 7070.96
kosher were just like having a technical

7068.639 --> 7072.88
conversation right through it and they

7070.96 --> 7075.119
were just ignoring him it's one of the

7072.88 --> 7077.84
funniest moments i've ever

7075.119 --> 7079.679
experienced

7077.84 --> 7082.400000000001
relating to flat earth

7079.679 --> 7082.4
on the internet

7084.719 --> 7088.8
i think there's like a video like of the

7089.599 --> 7094.56
the funniest globe or moments or

7091.92 --> 7098.28
something where that is a part of it

7094.56 --> 7098.280000000001
that's in the list

7102.719 --> 7109.96
it was hilarious have you ever seen it

7105.119 --> 7109.96
slow mo moonbug it is quite hysterical

7117.52 --> 7122.0
yeah i'm appealed that's

7120.4 --> 7125.28
yeah it's always bit difficult with

7122.0 --> 7127.119
george with george sanford to be

7125.28 --> 7131.0
positive

7127.119 --> 7131.0

7143.36 --> 7148.239
oh what

7144.8 --> 7151.119000000001

7523.199 --> 7528.4
probably just show it on my show by now

7526.48 --> 7531.5199999999995
it's really freaking funny

7528.4 --> 7534.96
wait did i i think i've already actually

7531.52 --> 7536.719
shown it on an early bird show

7534.96 --> 7539.199
but that's quite a while ago though

7536.719 --> 7539.199
that's like

7540.32 --> 7546.88
like episode around 200 or something i

7544.159 --> 7549.119
don't know a long time ago it i mean it

7546.88 --> 7551.1990000000005
happened a long time ago

7549.119 --> 7553.44
but it is still in my memory one of the

7551.199 --> 7557.5599999999995
funniest moments that involved sean

7553.44 --> 7557.5599999999995
hawkins and rump is both

7581.199 --> 7585.04
you conquer

7582.719 --> 7585.04
why

7587.04 --> 7589.28
but

7587.92 --> 7594.4
i don't know where you're getting that

7589.28 --> 7594.4
from rufus and hobbins like seriously

7594.96 --> 7600.28
the [ __ ] is prophetic about what

7607.44 --> 7611.719
what the hell are you talking about

7629.44 --> 7635.678999999999
got to show it now what

7633.28 --> 7637.599
no i haven't found it yet

7635.679 --> 7641.119
jeff gassett

7637.599 --> 7641.92
i'm asking the guys over at skype if

7641.119 --> 7646.119
they

7641.92 --> 7646.119
if they have the video somewhere

7648.48 --> 7652.879999999999
but if i played it on the early bird

7650.88 --> 7655.52
show i'm pretty sure that i hadn't

7652.88 --> 7655.52
titled it

7656.639 --> 7662.2390000000005
like in a way that i could easily find

7658.88 --> 7662.2390000000005
it hold up

7662.32 --> 7667.199
it's worth a shot maybe i will find

7664.8 --> 7667.1990000000005
something

7670.32 --> 7675.4
playlist early bird show

7677.76 --> 7680.76
no

7688.56 --> 7690.8
dude

7692.56 --> 7695.8
this is

7726.88 --> 7731.28
man

7729.04 --> 7734.76
i didn't even title my shows

7731.28 --> 7734.759999999999
most of them

7745.52 --> 7748.52
hmm

7770.96 --> 7776.96
um no

7774.079 --> 7778.88
no if i've played it

7776.96 --> 7781.44
on the early word show then i'm pretty

7778.88 --> 7783.1990000000005
sure that i didn't title it

7781.44 --> 7785.678999999999
unfortunately

7783.199 --> 7788.239
to yeah to be able to find it back so

7785.679 --> 7791.88
i'm just gonna have to like refine the

7788.239 --> 7791.879999999999
original footage

7822.639 --> 7825.639
hmm

7828.32 --> 7830.639
whoa

7834.32 --> 7837.679
yeah i'm scrolling through it

7839.28 --> 7845.4
interesting things there

7841.44 --> 7845.4
that i'm reminded about

7868.079 --> 7872.88
yeah no i'm stopping

7871.04 --> 7875.679
this is just kind of wasting your time

7872.88 --> 7878.079
guys sorry about that i i hope that i

7875.679 --> 7880.8
could have found the video in the list

7878.079 --> 7880.799999999999
but i didn't

7881.36 --> 7885.36
uh

7882.719 --> 7887.679
let's see oh i'm already past two hours

7885.36 --> 7887.679
damn

7890.4 --> 7896.92
i think i'm gonna

7892.0 --> 7896.92
maneuver towards rounding out the show

7901.04 --> 7904.56
any title suggestions

7905.36 --> 7910.079
i think that would be in general hey oh

7907.92 --> 7911.28
what's that

7910.079 --> 7914.48
huh

7911.28 --> 7914.48
a horse and buggy

7915.599 --> 7919.119000000001
oh yeah it's kind of behind the treat i

7917.44 --> 7922.119
don't know you could probably barely see

7919.119 --> 7922.119
it

7931.44 --> 7936.919999999999
yeah that's always kind of an

7932.719 --> 7936.92
interesting site when that happens

7940.239 --> 7943.239
hmm

7959.36 --> 7964.32
slime ties

7962.4 --> 7967.199
very funny

7964.32 --> 7969.759999999999
very funny

7967.199 --> 7972.719
right so i think i'm rounding out the

7969.76 --> 7972.719
show was there anything

7975.44 --> 7979.04
that i really needed to see

7979.599 --> 7982.599
oh

7983.679 --> 7988.079
all right i i just noticed owen benjamin

7986.639 --> 7990.079
had a

7988.079 --> 7994.32
is the friday stream

7990.079 --> 7996.5599999999995
bananas republic's banana republics

7994.32 --> 7999.119
hmm interesting i think i'm going to go

7996.56 --> 8001.280000000001
watch that

7999.119 --> 8004.0
somewhere later today or tomorrow

8001.28 --> 8004.0
depending on

8006.48 --> 8011.759999999999
what i'm going to be doing

8008.48 --> 8014.879999999999
if any online marketing or advertisement

8011.76 --> 8014.88
for my what

8015.679 --> 8019.119
what the hell are you talking about

8022.84 --> 8027.76
no

8024.639 --> 8032.2390000000005
no i don't the pretty much the marketing

8027.76 --> 8034.8
that exists is through word of mouth

8032.239 --> 8038.159
through people sharing the show and also

8034.8 --> 8039.92
well a big factor is overall is nathan

8038.159 --> 8042.638999999999
oakley

8039.92 --> 8045.04
who's been very supportive also through

8042.639 --> 8046.639
word of mouth making mention

8045.04 --> 8047.599
through ball busters

8046.639 --> 8049.1990000000005
right

8047.599 --> 8051.360000000001
it's they're both

8049.199 --> 8053.678999999999
niche

8051.36 --> 8056.0
but yeah

8053.679 --> 8058.56
like how how would that work like the

8056.0 --> 8062.079
only way it could ever like try to get

8058.56 --> 8065.1990000000005
through to people is by literally just

8062.079 --> 8067.84
jumping into some random place where

8065.199 --> 8070.638999999999
it's probably all numpties and then just

8067.84 --> 8073.04
saying oh flat earth early bird huh

8070.639 --> 8075.1990000000005
you think the earth is a gl like start

8073.04 --> 8078.88
flat smacking advertising that would be

8075.199 --> 8081.839999999999
the only way pretty much to do that

8078.88 --> 8081.84
but

8084.4 --> 8089.5199999999995
i don't really see the point like would

8086.8 --> 8092.639
that really make my channel grow that

8089.52 --> 8095.360000000001
much i mean at this point

8092.639 --> 8098.639
would anything that i do other than just

8095.36 --> 8099.759999999999
my show really make my channel grow that

8098.639 --> 8103.28
much

8099.76 --> 8103.280000000001
just honestly ask yourself

8103.52 --> 8110.159000000001
would it really do that

8105.76 --> 8110.159000000001
when i am very widely known

8110.56 --> 8116.159000000001
i mean pretty much the big flat earthers

8113.52 --> 8118.400000000001
all know i exist

8116.159 --> 8120.48
they do

8118.4 --> 8121.679
i'm second wave

8120.48 --> 8124.799999999999
i've been

8121.679 --> 8127.04
at it for a long long time i've very

8124.8 --> 8129.28
widely developed ideas that have

8127.04 --> 8131.84
integrated into the wider flat earth

8129.28 --> 8131.84
community

8132.239 --> 8138.159
both technical and spiritual like yeah

8136.0 --> 8140.8
just because not everybody keeps saying

8138.159 --> 8143.28
my name all day long

8140.8 --> 8146.8
doesn't mean that i'm not

8143.28 --> 8146.8
widely known to be there

8148.32 --> 8153.44
talk to david why she's got it down okay

8151.04 --> 8156.4
about what

8153.44 --> 8158.5599999999995
about what david wise knows me

8156.4 --> 8160.799999999999
like he's the first flat earther i even

8158.56 --> 8164.1990000000005
talked to face to face

8160.8 --> 8164.1990000000005
over skype

8166.8 --> 8173.1990000000005
he knows i'm there i did you know that i

8169.44 --> 8175.28
was actually a comment moderator for his

8173.199 --> 8179.839999999999
personal channel

8175.28 --> 8179.84
like four or five years ago

8180.079 --> 8185.119
i had like

8181.679 --> 8187.1990000000005
login data to his youtube channel to

8185.119 --> 8189.119
because i offered to help moderate him

8187.199 --> 8191.119
because he got a lot of troll comments

8189.119 --> 8192.639
and [ __ ] and he didn't have the time to

8191.119 --> 8194.319
deal with that and i was like oh yeah

8192.639 --> 8195.92
let me at it i'll do that for you i want

8194.319 --> 8197.84
to help

8195.92 --> 8200.16
so

8197.84 --> 8202.719000000001
yeah i know david wise

8200.16 --> 8202.719
and he is

8204.84 --> 8210.16
awesome you just got to be a little bit

8207.76 --> 8212.16
cautious about the jew factor

8210.16 --> 8213.2
you know

8212.16 --> 8215.679
but

8213.2 --> 8217.84
yeah whether that's really a joke or

8215.679 --> 8220.84
whether it's not that's up for

8217.84 --> 8220.84
interpretation

8226.479 --> 8232.479
you told david weiss about turtle's

8228.8 --> 8235.479
connection with lunar calendar what

8232.479 --> 8235.479
okay

8243.84 --> 8247.880000000001
darth stole it from you

8250.24 --> 8254.96
all right can happen

8252.639 --> 8256.08
that could happen

8254.96 --> 8258.319
i mean

8256.08 --> 8258.319
yeah

8259.12 --> 8265.2
david wise hasn't really turned out to

8262.0 --> 8267.84
have stolen much of my ideas

8265.2 --> 8270.559000000001
i mean i wish he would but he just keeps

8267.84 --> 8275.08
not doing that he keeps on basically

8270.559 --> 8275.08
going a more reified route

8277.12 --> 8282.08
in many ways but that's his own

8279.2 --> 8282.08
prerogative you know

8283.28 --> 8287.2
but yeah i don't know if i heard a

8285.439 --> 8290.960000000001
really good idea and was really all

8287.2 --> 8293.679
about it i'd probably steal it too

8290.96 --> 8296.08
although me personally i take great care

8293.679 --> 8298.479
too if i got an idea from somebody then

8296.08 --> 8300.24
i'll mention who that is even if nobody

8298.479 --> 8302.0
knows who that actually is that doesn't

8300.24 --> 8304.559
matter but i will say

8302.0 --> 8308.559
that i got it from somebody if i got it

8304.559 --> 8308.559
from somebody other than myself

8317.519 --> 8320.479
yes he is a great guy doing great things

8319.599 --> 8322.880000000001
and

8320.479 --> 8324.719
reaching pretty high i mean he gets on

8322.88 --> 8326.719
freaking infowars

8324.719 --> 8328.479
with flat earth right

8326.719 --> 8330.559
i mean alex stein

8328.479 --> 8332.88
is getting on the info wars but not

8330.559 --> 8334.96
about flat earth but about poly

8332.88 --> 8338.0
political satire

8334.96 --> 8340.16
right david wise actually got on the

8338.0 --> 8342.0
alex jones shows

8340.16 --> 8344.479
multiple times

8342.0 --> 8346.96
about flat earth right now that's

8344.479 --> 8350.719
that's pretty heavy

8346.96 --> 8350.719
that they even allowed him in there

8352.399 --> 8354.639
so

8358.08 --> 8364.559
yeah he's he's a valuable asset for the

8360.319 --> 8364.559
flat earth community in my opinion

8371.599 --> 8375.84
my ideas go against his admiral yeah i

8373.519 --> 8375.84
know

8377.12 --> 8382.319000000001
there's a financial interest to keep the

8378.719 --> 8384.0
model inconsistent yes and i've even

8382.319 --> 8385.76
basically

8384.0 --> 8388.08
stated that

8385.76 --> 8389.359
like i don't mind if he does that i get

8388.08 --> 8391.28
it

8389.359 --> 8394.0
it's just that it

8391.28 --> 8397.0
annoys me out of principle

8394.0 --> 8397.0
right

8403.12 --> 8407.28
because it's not something that i

8405.04 --> 8410.080000000002
personally would do if it's like oh

8407.28 --> 8411.76
oh this idea that i figured out is

8410.08 --> 8413.52
absolutely true

8411.76 --> 8415.76
yeah it's not really going to work well

8413.52 --> 8418.399000000001
with people so i'm going to do something

8415.76 --> 8421.2
that's very close to it that will have a

8418.399 --> 8423.599999999999
wider range even though it's technically

8421.2 --> 8424.640000000001
incorrect yeah that's something you'll

8423.6 --> 8427.04
never

8424.64 --> 8429.519999999999
ever catch me doing

8427.04 --> 8431.6
maybe bowen would do that right about

8429.52 --> 8433.76
the globe model but yeah what choice do

8431.6 --> 8437.28
you have if you're going to defend that

8433.76 --> 8440.08
but me arwin about the reality of the

8437.28 --> 8442.08
realm and its nature i would never be

8440.08 --> 8443.76
caught doing that ever

8442.08 --> 8446.64
i would never

8443.76 --> 8448.399
do that like not even in in something

8446.64 --> 8451.039999999999
that is not even being recorded i would

8448.399 --> 8453.279999999999
just never do that

8451.04 --> 8455.12
but yeah david weiss doesn't seem to

8453.28 --> 8458.560000000001
have a problem

8455.12 --> 8461.52
with basically straying a little from it

8458.56 --> 8463.68
to be more effective and he's not the

8461.52 --> 8466.479000000001
first one to do it i mean mark sargent

8463.68 --> 8469.68
has been applying that too

8466.479 --> 8471.358999999999
it was widely discussed for a long time

8469.68 --> 8472.960000000001
like even on the flare of debates we

8471.359 --> 8474.479000000001
discussed that like why are they doing

8472.96 --> 8475.839999999998
that

8474.479 --> 8478.119999999999
it's wrong

8475.84 --> 8480.24
they're reifying things well

8478.12 --> 8482.160000000002
psychologically though it is a good

8480.24 --> 8485.439
stepping stone for those who are still

8482.16 --> 8488.319
in the pure globe mindset to snap out of

8485.439 --> 8489.52
it through a contrast of a reified flat

8488.319 --> 8492.479
model

8489.52 --> 8494.800000000001
it helps it helps them

8492.479 --> 8494.8
it's

8495.68 --> 8498.479000000001
let's see

8497.439 --> 8500.64
it's like

8498.479 --> 8502.96
uh

8500.64 --> 8506.0
there's certain drug addictions and then

8502.96 --> 8507.759999999998
they give another type of drug to get

8506.0 --> 8510.399
off that drug addiction and it works

8507.76 --> 8512.800000000001
really well but then you can still get

8510.399 --> 8514.24
addicted to that drug that you use to

8512.8 --> 8516.319
get off it right it's kind of a

8514.24 --> 8519.039999999999
situation like that like yeah it works

8516.319 --> 8521.279999999999
really well to get off the ball

8519.04 --> 8524.560000000001
but it's still not entirely correct and

8521.28 --> 8528.08
you can still get stuck in that

8524.56 --> 8529.84
reified flat disk model

8528.08 --> 8532.319
right but

8529.84 --> 8533.2
should you not use it because that could

8532.319 --> 8534.16
happen

8533.2 --> 8536.960000000001
you know

8534.16 --> 8539.28
or you're just gonna help people get off

8536.96 --> 8541.438999999998
that globe through a way that's not

8539.28 --> 8543.359
perfect but at least it's

8541.439 --> 8544.399
widely effective

8543.359 --> 8546.880000000001
right

8544.399 --> 8550.24
that's been reasoned out

8546.88 --> 8553.679999999998
and that's one of the reasons why i

8550.24 --> 8555.52
yeah pretty much support david weiss

8553.68 --> 8557.2
full-heartedly

8555.52 --> 8558.560000000001
but i will point out when he's just

8557.2 --> 8560.640000000001
technically wrong

8558.56 --> 8562.16
and i will try to rub it in his face out

8560.64 --> 8563.599999999999
of principle

8562.16 --> 8566.08
but i still

8563.6 --> 8568.800000000001
think he's doing good things

8566.08 --> 8570.96
even though he is entertaining

8568.8 --> 8572.399
reifications

8570.96 --> 8574.88
i know that

8572.399 --> 8577.68
right methodolo right yeah that's what i

8574.88 --> 8582.119999999999
was talking about yeah yeah

8577.68 --> 8582.12
thanks emma peel for looking that up

8588.64 --> 8593.119999999999
not sure it helps when they see the

8591.12 --> 8596.08
false model debunked yeah but it's not

8593.12 --> 8599.04
about people that are on the anti-flat

8596.08 --> 8600.88
earther level yeah because of course if

8599.04 --> 8603.6
you're like

8600.88 --> 8605.599999999999
flat earth is always wrong it must be a

8603.6 --> 8607.04
globe yeah you're going to point at the

8605.6 --> 8608.800000000001
reified

8607.04 --> 8612.319000000001
flat earth disc model and say look

8608.8 --> 8615.279999999999
what's wrong you're reinforcing

8612.319 --> 8618.319
yeah yeah we know yeah

8615.28 --> 8620.0
it's absolutely not a ball though if

8618.319 --> 8621.039999999999
that is the reason why you're pointing

8620.0 --> 8624.0
that out

8621.04 --> 8626.080000000002
you know right it's not meant for people

8624.0 --> 8628.56
like it's not meant for anti-flat earth

8626.08 --> 8630.0
it's not meant to pacify anti-flat

8628.56 --> 8632.319
earthers

8630.0 --> 8635.68
anti-flag earthers will not be pacified

8632.319 --> 8636.96
except by their own retardation

8635.68 --> 8637.76
and their own

8636.96 --> 8639.279999999999
just

8637.76 --> 8641.12
dementia

8639.28 --> 8643.12
when they're confronted with how they're

8641.12 --> 8645.439
absolutely wrong right

8643.12 --> 8648.319000000001
it does it's not for that it's for

8645.439 --> 8651.28
general public for basic conditioned

8648.319 --> 8653.76
people that just went through school

8651.28 --> 8655.68
were like shamed into believing it was a

8653.76 --> 8659.12
globe at a young age

8655.68 --> 8662.16
that have formed their mind in the wider

8659.12 --> 8664.479000000001
society thinking in that way

8662.16 --> 8667.039999999999
and then presenting the

8664.479 --> 8669.199999999999
slightly reified disc model as an

8667.04 --> 8670.800000000001
alternative to assist in the

8669.2 --> 8673.28
visualization

8670.8 --> 8676.399
transition process

8673.28 --> 8676.399000000001
that's what it's good for

8676.88 --> 8682.319
what the hell

8679.12 --> 8684.720000000001
freaking camera

8682.319 --> 8686.319
it's weird by the way it gave a little

8684.72 --> 8688.0
light

8686.319 --> 8691.119999999999
when it turned off

8688.0 --> 8691.12
is it doing it again

8695.2 --> 8700.880000000001
right but it's a visualization

8697.359 --> 8700.880000000001
processing assistant

8700.96 --> 8706.399
to basically draw in the reified

8703.76 --> 8708.84
flatter disk model as an alternative for

8706.399 --> 8710.399
the globe right it's to help you

8708.84 --> 8712.72
assist

8710.399 --> 8714.96
the transition which is mostly

8712.72 --> 8717.679999999998
psychological

8714.96 --> 8720.88
to just let go of the globe that it has

8717.68 --> 8723.359
to be a globe that's that's what

8720.88 --> 8725.119999999999
what if advice is model and mark

8723.359 --> 8727.2
sergeant and all what they've been doing

8725.12 --> 8729.12
that's what it's good for

8727.2 --> 8731.92
it's not going to help against anti-flat

8729.12 --> 8735.28
earthers because they will just think of

8731.92 --> 8735.28
anything they can say

8735.76 --> 8739.2
to

8736.88 --> 8740.72
yeah to negate whatever a flat earth is

8739.2 --> 8743.04
going to say

8740.72 --> 8745.119999999999
if they say it's not a globe they don't

8743.04 --> 8748.720000000001
really care they don't really care if

8745.12 --> 8749.68
whether it's a reification or not

8748.72 --> 8753.119999999999
right

8749.68 --> 8756.880000000001
they don't care

8753.12 --> 8758.240000000002
right anyway i'm gonna run out the show
