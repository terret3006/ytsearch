foreign

7.89 --> 37.769999999999996
[Music]

56.899 --> 64.799

60.48 --> 66.29899999999999
bird number 1409 I'm your host Arwin and

64.799 --> 68.34
before we start the show please don't

66.299 --> 70.68
forget to share it on any platform

68.34 --> 73.02000000000001
medium fit and if you haven't already

90.24 --> 94.5
please keep it coming

92.46 --> 98.22
that would be great

94.5 --> 100.259
right so whether today

98.22 --> 103.03999999999999
quite a turnaround

100.259 --> 103.04
look at this

104.7 --> 109.88
quite the turnaround

107.34 --> 109.88000000000001
so

110.1 --> 117.24
there's a lot of wind blowing

112.979 --> 121.38
it's a very windy day and the yeah look

117.24 --> 123.899
at this blue sky look at that

121.38 --> 126.78
so it's actually really nice and bright

123.899 --> 129.36
sunny but yeah the wind

126.78 --> 133.379
does get a bit in the way

129.36 --> 135.84
so it's probably great if you just

133.379 --> 137.7
sitting behind the window straight in

135.84 --> 141.379
that Sun so you can just

137.7 --> 141.379
absorb it without the wind

141.599 --> 147.48
but it's yeah it's quite beautiful very

144.14 --> 149.66
invigorating all that extra Sun for a

147.48 --> 149.66
change

159.92 --> 166.7
first in chat good to see you fiber oats

164.04 --> 166.7
welcome

167.34 --> 172.98
it is the 1st of November 2022.

174.0 --> 177.98
this is an interesting start of the

175.8 --> 177.98000000000002
month

179.819 --> 182.72
uh

185.58 --> 190.31900000000002
right

187.92 --> 192.05999999999997
so yeah I managed to drum up a little

190.319 --> 193.56
title

192.06 --> 196.56
for the show psychological

193.56 --> 196.56
environmentalism

197.34 --> 204.0
which yeah is kind of in response to

200.519 --> 206.64000000000001
like a moves out there again

204.0 --> 209.64
of this corporate

206.64 --> 209.64
environmentalism

209.879 --> 215.459
that is just completely hijacked and

212.22 --> 216.3
like rich people basically being flown

215.459 --> 219.599
in

216.3 --> 220.799
rich kids getting flown in over Jets and

219.599 --> 223.5
[ __ ]

220.799 --> 226.26000000000002
and then Guided by police perform

223.5 --> 231.5
vandalism

226.26 --> 231.5
right and then I was thinking well

231.78 --> 237.599
I'm kind of the opposite of that I'm a

233.879 --> 237.599
psychological environmentalist

237.9 --> 244.86
because I want to keep the psyche as

241.379 --> 247.07999999999998
clean as I can I mean that is really way

244.86 --> 249.72000000000003
of our going about for me in many ways

247.08 --> 252.239
even though I have a lot of

249.72 --> 254.159
extreme capabilities

252.239 --> 257.94
right

254.159 --> 260.59999999999997
I was working on just keeping it

257.94 --> 263.58
as clean as possible and as well

260.6 --> 265.56
truthful always but just keeping it

263.58 --> 268.74
under control keep it clean as possible

265.56 --> 271.8
but something's gonna happen then be

268.74 --> 275.28000000000003
honest about it and productive with it

271.8 --> 278.04
and correct mistakes

275.28 --> 281.15999999999997
learn from it right psychological

278.04 --> 284.639
environmentalism so basic title

281.16 --> 288.41900000000004
but interesting implications

284.639 --> 291.24
right because I I find this whole fake

288.419 --> 294.479
environmental movement really atrocious

291.24 --> 297.54
like it really offends me

294.479 --> 301.38
because I like the environment I like

297.54 --> 304.1
clean nature and all that and green

301.38 --> 304.1
everywhere

304.139 --> 308.52
right

305.52 --> 312.24
but they've taken it just overboard and

308.52 --> 314.82
it's it's just destructive it's Marxist

312.24 --> 317.52
it's not good for anybody if they just

314.82 --> 320.78
got their way fully with everything

317.52 --> 320.78
you know where it leads

321.06 --> 326.24
leads to eating the bugs and ownings and

324.0 --> 326.24
nothing

329.16 --> 335.82000000000005
right so that was on my mind a bit I was

332.759 --> 339.68
also watching Owen Benjamin

335.82 --> 339.68
from yesterday very interesting

344.4 --> 349.15999999999997
I like the way he's now deep diving

350.039 --> 354.71999999999997
like

352.02 --> 356.639
he had this one little bit where he was

354.72 --> 359.1
just

356.639 --> 361.5
trying to simulate having a conversation

359.1 --> 364.32000000000005
with his grandfather

361.5 --> 366.479
right and he took it so serious I mean

364.32 --> 369.96
the way he did that you even mentioned

366.479 --> 372.24
fractal thinking like yeah that was real

369.96 --> 374.75899999999996
the spiritual metadata absolutely

372.24 --> 377.16
confirmed that that is exactly what he

374.759 --> 380.40000000000003
was saying and he was simulating it's

377.16 --> 383.16
very interesting to see

380.4 --> 385.19899999999996
somebody else do it

383.16 --> 391.699
very similarly

385.199 --> 391.699
and so yeah I mean Big Bear is really

392.419 --> 399.44
growing from Just A sly barred into a

396.96 --> 399.44
proper King

400.8 --> 407.78000000000003
for at least weekend

402.66 --> 407.78000000000003
and yeah it's cool I'm liking it

407.94 --> 410.96
hey psych bear

414.6 --> 421.56
what I'm liking less however

417.6 --> 424.08000000000004
is however when I'm on a roll

421.56 --> 426.66
a lot of you guys tend to just shut the

424.08 --> 429.06
[ __ ] up all of a sudden

426.66 --> 432.36
now I don't like to be disrupted in my

429.06 --> 434.4
train of thinking totally right but

432.36 --> 437.639
there is something else you could do too

434.4 --> 441.539
and it's what I tend to do a lot when I

437.639 --> 444.8
watch other people's streams and that is

441.539 --> 444.8
just add to it

447.5 --> 451.919
[Music]

449.0 --> 453.84
if that helps if you're not too busy I

451.919 --> 456.599
mean a lot of you guys probably are also

453.84 --> 458.46
like working and [ __ ] it's a bit of a

456.599 --> 461.4
complication

458.46 --> 464.18
because of the time schedule for the

461.4 --> 464.17999999999995
early bird show

470.099 --> 475.08
like a night owl type setup does not

472.74 --> 478.979
have that issue right

475.08 --> 480.599
but it has other issues issues being

478.979 --> 483.0
I'm usually

480.599 --> 485.759
like more in a time when I tend to be

483.0 --> 489.74
intoxicated slightly

485.759 --> 492.36
and even though yeah it doesn't really

489.74 --> 494.699
disrupt me it's annoying when I get

492.36 --> 498.139
slurry and it just happens sometimes

494.699 --> 498.139
it's almost unpredictable

500.099 --> 506.34
uh

502.259 --> 508.44
and I don't really want to be like

506.34 --> 511.44
under influence when I stream it's also

508.44 --> 512.64
part of it right because yeah I do those

511.44 --> 514.44
things

512.64 --> 516.5989999999999
but I'm not

514.44 --> 521.12
like proud of it I'm not trying to like

516.599 --> 524.5200000000001
normalize that that's why I never smoke

521.12 --> 528.0
or drink alcohol

524.52 --> 530.1
on a live show except with one exception

528.0 --> 532.62
and that would be the New Year's Eve

530.1 --> 535.32
stream that I kind of started a

532.62 --> 538.019
tradition doing that's like the only

535.32 --> 540.0
stream in a year where you might see me

538.019 --> 540.9590000000001
actually drinking a beer and smoking a

540.0 --> 543.24
joint

540.959 --> 545.88
when I don't do that

543.24 --> 548.04
I hope you've noticed that

545.88 --> 550.74
it's very important to me because I

548.04 --> 554.64
don't want people to normalize that or

550.74 --> 554.64
to think that it's

555.12 --> 558.92
I don't want it to distract them

558.959 --> 564.18
to divert them away

561.0 --> 566.459
right if they if they're all with that

564.18 --> 568.26
then it's their business if they don't

566.459 --> 570.54
want to have anything to do with it well

568.26 --> 572.9399999999999
then I don't want to be that grabbler

570.54 --> 574.56
that's rubbing it in their face

572.94 --> 577.2
and either

574.56 --> 578.16
send them away which would be purely my

577.2 --> 581.1
loss

578.16 --> 582.6
or maybe even getting them addicted when

581.1 --> 585.5400000000001
they didn't want to

582.6 --> 587.1
so that's why

585.54 --> 590.0999999999999
part of the psychological

587.1 --> 590.1
environmentalism

590.7 --> 597.1400000000001
I don't

592.14 --> 597.14
I basically don't do drugs

597.54 --> 603.24
on on camera

600.6 --> 607.08
or if I'm if I would be like really

603.24 --> 610.38
typically influenced by something then

607.08 --> 614.36
I'll wait a bit until I feel that I can

610.38 --> 616.98
have enough control over my composure

614.36 --> 618.899
that it's not going to be distracting

616.98 --> 621.3000000000001
and going to be blatantly obvious like

618.899 --> 622.14
whoa this is under influence or

621.3 --> 624.12
something

622.14 --> 625.92
because I don't want to be

624.12 --> 628.32
seen like that

625.92 --> 630.06
which interestingly enough is also kind

628.32 --> 634.62
of a way that a lot of

630.06 --> 636.4799999999999
Muslims apparently deal with sins

634.62 --> 639.3
Owen Benjamin brought that up the other

636.48 --> 642.54
day I think two two days ago was the

639.3 --> 645.06
Saturday or the Friday stream

642.54 --> 647.579
and

645.06 --> 649.26
I think that's that that really is how

647.579 --> 651.0
they do it like they have sort of

649.26 --> 653.279
fetishes sometimes

651.0 --> 654.959
like some Bets with their car right and

653.279 --> 656.7
they even brought it up a bit with like

654.959 --> 660.779
the car washing they want their private

656.7 --> 664.0790000000001
time car washing was apparently

660.779 --> 665.88
some Arabs even like really strict

664.079 --> 668.399
Muslims have that

665.88 --> 671.459
but then they have to keep it a secret

668.399 --> 674.88
they have to keep it private they're not

671.459 --> 676.16
not turn it into porn right even with

674.88 --> 678.36
basic things

676.16 --> 682.14
[Music]

678.36 --> 685.019
and in a way I've tried to adapt that

682.14 --> 686.64
system because it's very sensible I mean

685.019 --> 687.72
everybody's going to deal with their own

686.64 --> 690.48
sins

687.72 --> 692.399
and if you just try to cut it off or

690.48 --> 695.04
squeeze it shut

692.399 --> 697.019
it's gonna have a very

695.04 --> 700.019
Wild

697.019 --> 701.76
of the negative influence on your entire

700.019 --> 703.92
being

701.76 --> 707.579
suppression pure suppression like

703.92 --> 708.54
witches leads to like denial right and

707.579 --> 709.8
then

708.54 --> 714.5999999999999
yeah

709.8 --> 718.019
it's better to find well then yeah

714.6 --> 720.9590000000001
better to stumble upon a sin like it and

718.019 --> 723.66
keep it under control and that actually

720.959 --> 727.5
means keep it under control

723.66 --> 729.3
not just keep it secret and let it grow

727.5 --> 730.8
more and more out of control very

729.3 --> 733.3389999999999
important

730.8 --> 733.3389999999999
right

734.519 --> 740.48
and that way you just have your own

737.22 --> 740.48
struggles in private

740.519 --> 747.3
well you yeah uphold the a proper public

744.12 --> 749.94
code as it were let's do not seduce

747.3 --> 752.519
people around you with sin sinful

749.94 --> 755.1600000000001
Behavior even if just minor

752.519 --> 757.74
and the awareness of all that and

755.16 --> 759.86
responsibility anyway yeah inspired

757.74 --> 762.36
inspired

759.86 --> 765.0600000000001
psychological environmentalism

762.36 --> 767.7
it's funny how just a couple of words

765.06 --> 771.779
can certainly like summarize a whole

767.7 --> 775.639
range of actions and up get principles

771.779 --> 775.639
that have basically been doing

776.1 --> 781.62
just for the principles not really

778.5 --> 784.5
seeing that much cohesion just trusting

781.62 --> 786.66
that there is something there it's what

784.5 --> 787.74
I'm supposed to do things will come

786.66 --> 792.139
together

787.74 --> 792.139
trust God because it really does

793.019 --> 798.54
right it's like

795.48 --> 801.3000000000001
you got a whole range of

798.54 --> 803.399
skills like really different skills

801.3 --> 805.3199999999999
right and you're all really good at that

803.399 --> 807.06
and you like doing them but they don't

805.32 --> 809.94
really fit together well are you then

807.06 --> 812.3389999999999
going to completely abandon some of them

809.94 --> 816.72
say like they don't fit so I'm gonna

812.339 --> 819.12
denounce that and or

816.72 --> 822.24
you just let it be

819.12 --> 824.16
and over time all of a sudden some

822.24 --> 826.62
situation arrives

824.16 --> 829.92
something big changes the energies

826.62 --> 831.24
change and then those things that you've

829.92 --> 833.8199999999999
always had

831.24 --> 835.86
might have a whole new perspective to

833.82 --> 839.1
you and you might subtly tie them

835.86 --> 841.38
together perfectly in some way or

839.1 --> 844.399
indirectly and then everything comes

841.38 --> 848.0
together falls into place like God

844.399 --> 848.0
prepared the road

851.04 --> 855.18
this is a

852.6 --> 857.5400000000001
a principle basically and I take it very

855.18 --> 857.54
serious

858.48 --> 864.779
right it's completely

861.959 --> 867.4799999999999
between you and God has nothing to do

864.779 --> 869.22
with any like contracts with worldly

867.48 --> 871.019
interests

869.22 --> 874.4590000000001
anyway

871.019 --> 874.4590000000001
hello Terry 306

877.019 --> 879.8

936.72 --> 941.88
have noticed but it seems like YouTube

938.519 --> 944.779
has undergone some kind of

941.88 --> 944.779
overhaul

945.18 --> 952.0999999999999
let me check the smileys

947.94 --> 952.1
are certainly loading quicker

953.579 --> 957.9799999999999
oh yeah I'm still stuck to a black thumb

962.04 --> 964.5799999999999
right but the visuals are slightly

964.079 --> 967.809
different

964.58 --> 967.8090000000001
[Music]

979.92 --> 983.3499999999999
oh still raining over there future

981.66 --> 985.38
Christian all right

983.35 --> 989.88
[Music]

985.38 --> 995.959
well it's it's just really blue sky

989.88 --> 995.959
here but also with a lot of wind

997.22 --> 1000.379
[Music]

1000.98 --> 1006.98
that's a 17 degrees Celsius

1004.639 --> 1010.899
it feels like it's more but that's

1006.98 --> 1010.899
probably because of the of the Sun

1016.88 --> 1020.42
right anyway

1025.22 --> 1028.22
foreign

1028.4 --> 1033.699
so yeah maybe

1030.919 --> 1037.5790000000002
Maybe by just throwing it out here

1033.699 --> 1040.5790000000002
psychological environmentalism

1037.579 --> 1043.1599999999999
might have a deep impact because it is

1040.579 --> 1045.62
like it's a Consciousness thing it's

1043.16 --> 1047.78
like hey look at what

1045.62 --> 1050.299
we do

1047.78 --> 1052.6399999999999
what you might do or what you might have

1050.299 --> 1054.32
become interested in and are developing

1052.64 --> 1056.9
a skill and you might not even really

1054.32 --> 1059.36
know what it has been

1056.9 --> 1062.3200000000002
just like these priorities then these

1059.36 --> 1062.32
things you end up doing

1062.9 --> 1069.14
keeping your mind Serene knowing how to

1066.5 --> 1071.299
learn things without it completely

1069.14 --> 1072.7
ruining your day and potentially your

1071.299 --> 1076.7
family

1072.7 --> 1076.7
psychological environmentalism

1082.059 --> 1088.6399999999999
now of course

1084.44 --> 1090.14
what would be kind of the opposite

1088.64 --> 1092.24
foreign

1090.14 --> 1095.0
would be

1092.24 --> 1096.98
like the

1095.0 --> 1099.02
the woke

1096.98 --> 1103.22
system

1099.02 --> 1105.74
because the work system is pretending to

1103.22 --> 1106.7
be psychological environmentalism isn't

1105.74 --> 1111.08
it

1106.7 --> 1113.72
has a methodology safe space you erase

1111.08 --> 1116.48
people's freedom to say certain things

1113.72 --> 1121.28
and you have to then mandate adaptation

1116.48 --> 1123.64
of somebody's Niche little fantasies

1121.28 --> 1127.16
well

1123.64 --> 1128.6000000000001
blatantly of course that is well exactly

1127.16 --> 1130.039
the opposite of psychological

1128.6 --> 1132.799
environmentalism it's actually

1130.039 --> 1137.12
psychological pollution and massive

1132.799 --> 1139.58
distraction and turns people deranged

1137.12 --> 1142.1
so

1139.58 --> 1145.6599999999999
in a way psychological environmentalism

1142.1 --> 1145.6599999999999
has already been hijacked

1146.419 --> 1153.1000000000001
right but sometimes the masses need to

1149.48 --> 1153.1
be subjected to

1154.64 --> 1160.039
to the opponents

1157.4 --> 1163.72
and their strategies before they take up

1160.039 --> 1163.72
arms to counter them

1164.66 --> 1171.02
and I'd say yeah the time has come for

1167.9 --> 1173.6000000000001
psychological environmentalisms

1171.02 --> 1176.86
to stand up

1173.6 --> 1176.86
and become a thing

1179.32 --> 1186.559
and basically counter the whole woke

1181.94 --> 1189.5
nonsense satanic inside our world woke

1186.559 --> 1191.66
supposed psychological environmentalism

1189.5 --> 1194.36
that's been ravaging the Western World

1191.66 --> 1197.6200000000001
especially in

1194.36 --> 1197.62
what is it now

1197.9 --> 1204.22
for a decade

1200.84 --> 1204.22
a little over a decade

1205.34 --> 1209.539
or a little bit maybe two decades I

1207.679 --> 1211.4
don't remember exactly when all that

1209.539 --> 1213.799
started but it was certainly like when

1211.4 --> 1215.9
Obama got in got a massive boom that's

1213.799 --> 1218.5
really when it hit off terrible

1215.9 --> 1218.5
influence

1218.96 --> 1221.8600000000001
uh

1222.2 --> 1231.4
when was that wasn't that 2012 was that

1225.74 --> 1231.4
2000 2008 and 12 wasn't it

1233.12 --> 1239.9189999999999
right 8 12 was Obama 16 was Trump

1243.44 --> 1247.8400000000001
so one and a half decade anyway

1248.059 --> 1251.539
do with it what you will whoever reads

1250.7 --> 1256.9
this

1251.539 --> 1256.9
I mean just as just like my uh

1257.419 --> 1263.24
my little Drive-In private space project

1263.66 --> 1269.059
it's not really copyright I mean I'd

1266.059 --> 1270.98
like the honor of being referenced

1269.059 --> 1273.559
in general

1270.98 --> 1275.6
but it's free for the world for the

1273.559 --> 1279.7
taking

1275.6 --> 1279.6999999999998
because I think the world needs it

1281.66 --> 1285.799
and yeah it's like

1283.82 --> 1288.08
you want to make the world a better

1285.799 --> 1289.7
place start with yourself and then

1288.08 --> 1292.22
become

1289.7 --> 1294.38
become the teacher of how you wish the

1292.22 --> 1297.46
world to be but you have to then

1294.38 --> 1297.46
actually be that

1298.419 --> 1304.1000000000001
anyways

1301.179 --> 1305.48
I don't know if I'm starting to bore you

1304.1 --> 1309.1399999999999
guys yet

1305.48 --> 1313.52
or maybe your mind is blown I don't know

1309.14 --> 1317.0200000000002
hey hello Felix C

1313.52 --> 1317.02
d x c

1318.14 --> 1322.3600000000001
apological environmentalism

1320.299 --> 1325.539
sprayed letter exactly

1322.36 --> 1325.539
appreciate that

1333.79 --> 1338.02
[Music]

1335.6 --> 1338.02
foreign

1341.29 --> 1345.369
[Music]

1351.1 --> 1357.559
if you say so but that might be a mobile

1353.84 --> 1360.98
thing because if I hover over

1357.559 --> 1364.58
the thumb up button or thumb down button

1360.98 --> 1367.88
it it there's a little micro pop-up

1364.58 --> 1368.84
under it that says I like this I dislike

1367.88 --> 1372.98
this

1368.84 --> 1374.9599999999998
but you don't stand at C like dislike on

1372.98 --> 1376.94
the screen itself

1374.96 --> 1379.6000000000001
so yeah there's been some interface

1376.94 --> 1379.6000000000001
changes

1379.82 --> 1386.289
it seems though cosmetic

1383.15 --> 1386.289
[Music]

1388.88 --> 1393.44
still of a damn black thumbs up stuck in

1391.88 --> 1395.96
my uh

1393.44 --> 1398.9
in my emoticon so

1395.96 --> 1401.799
wish they'd fix that

1398.9 --> 1401.799
whatever

1410.67 --> 1420.3490000000002
[Music]

1420.5 --> 1426.76
yeah BJC that yeah no I mean the thing

1423.679 --> 1426.76
though is that

1427.1 --> 1432.9189999999999
let

1429.02 --> 1435.32
if I if I had come out with the idea

1432.919 --> 1437.96
like psychological environmentalism in

1435.32 --> 1439.7
2012 and I think I actually even wanted

1437.96 --> 1443.1200000000001
to at the time I think I might have

1439.7 --> 1446.24
already reached that insight for a bit

1443.12 --> 1448.9399999999998
and then it hit me that the woke [ __ ]

1446.24 --> 1452.179
just completely drowned everything up

1448.94 --> 1455.5
and I did not have a the confidence to

1452.179 --> 1455.5
meet the world yet

1455.539 --> 1463.179
I kind of have now since I've been

1458.299 --> 1463.179
online for so long daily like

1463.28 --> 1467.72
and

1465.2 --> 1471.2
back then the work was all fresh so

1467.72 --> 1473.419
there were people like really militantly

1471.2 --> 1474.6200000000001
on board with that they were really

1473.419 --> 1476.7800000000002
fanatic

1474.62 --> 1479.2399999999998
it was kind of dangerous I mean people

1476.78 --> 1481.28
were even getting attacked and [ __ ]

1479.24 --> 1484.34
if they'd resisted

1481.28 --> 1487.1589999999999
if they spoke up against that in some

1484.34 --> 1489.5
places not over here not that I've seen

1487.159 --> 1492.2600000000002
anyway but yeah I've seen some videos

1489.5 --> 1493.4
out there it's it's kind of hard to tell

1492.26 --> 1496.76
but

1493.4 --> 1500.0590000000002
it was it was really like a it felt at

1496.76 --> 1503.6589999999999
the time like this is like a

1500.059 --> 1506.4189999999999
a brown shirt operation

1503.659 --> 1508.64
like they're recruiting

1506.419 --> 1510.38
basically felt like oh [ __ ] they're

1508.64 --> 1512.72
recruiting Nazis and they're doing it

1510.38 --> 1515.419
through work so we're gonna get like

1512.72 --> 1517.88
weird status

1515.419 --> 1520.1000000000001
or like reverse people that think

1517.88 --> 1522.7990000000002
they're it's everything just got so

1520.1 --> 1525.5
messed up psychological psychological

1522.799 --> 1528.52
wise and disoriented because when the

1525.5 --> 1531.86
woke broke out back then it was terrible

1528.52 --> 1534.679
but now everybody knows that like

1531.86 --> 1539.36
everybody

1534.679 --> 1542.179
is taken a lot of toll and a lot of time

1539.36 --> 1544.279
but I mean everybody hates woke like

1542.179 --> 1546.38
everybody there's nobody that really

1544.279 --> 1548.96
likes that anymore it's it's people that

1546.38 --> 1551.7990000000002
are like panicking only that would kind

1548.96 --> 1551.799
of resort to that

1552.799 --> 1557.779
because it weirdly has some weird

1555.039 --> 1560.0
accommodation psychologically important

1557.779 --> 1562.52
it's like it is a sort of Escapist

1560.0 --> 1564.44
system that is kind of reliable for an

1562.52 --> 1566.9189999999999
Escapist system which kind of makes it

1564.44 --> 1566.919
dangerous

1568.84 --> 1574.22
upon all on top of all the other things

1571.34 --> 1576.6789999999999
that make it dangerous but now yeah

1574.22 --> 1579.679
maybe now people are ready to actually

1576.679 --> 1581.96
just let that kind of shrivel and die

1579.679 --> 1585.5
since it's been completely identified

1581.96 --> 1587.419
for what it is Everybody Hates woke

1585.5 --> 1589.22
and now maybe psychological

1587.419 --> 1591.919
environmentalism

1589.22 --> 1593.72
can take its place

1591.919 --> 1597.26
so yeah and this is going to sound a bit

1593.72 --> 1600.279
weird maybe even corny but so that the

1597.26 --> 1603.58
social justice Warriors

1600.279 --> 1605.24
might actually become

1603.58 --> 1609.02
real

1605.24 --> 1610.299
social justice Warriors and actually do

1609.02 --> 1613.039
what

1610.299 --> 1615.94
the original vision for a lot of them

1613.039 --> 1615.94
probably was

1616.94 --> 1624.38
and not just be corporate Stooges and

1620.72 --> 1626.96
goons and just like weird psychological

1624.38 --> 1630.3400000000001
shock troops which is kind of How It's

1626.96 --> 1630.3400000000001
been used thus far

1630.62 --> 1634.8799999999999
right

1633.08 --> 1636.799
but yeah

1634.88 --> 1639.14
I mean there's a lot of people that have

1636.799 --> 1641.179
dropped out of movements like that that

1639.14 --> 1644.419
are very woke

1641.179 --> 1646.1000000000001
but they must still feel like wow what a

1644.419 --> 1649.5800000000002
disappointment

1646.1 --> 1652.6399999999999
but what if there could be something

1649.58 --> 1655.96
that was more real

1652.64 --> 1655.96
and more yeah

1656.9 --> 1662.9
yeah less corporate

1659.32 --> 1665.6
more like original communist I almost

1662.9 --> 1668.6200000000001
they're not talking about like freaky

1665.6 --> 1673.279
dictator scenarios with MAO and all that

1668.62 --> 1676.6999999999998
but just like what you do for your

1673.279 --> 1678.62
environment for your region

1676.7 --> 1680.9
for where you live for the people there

1678.62 --> 1682.58
like even if you don't even know them

1680.9 --> 1684.679
all that much or you don't like them

1682.58 --> 1686.6
that you just basically have that

1684.679 --> 1689.419
attitude of

1686.6 --> 1691.6999999999998
I want this place to be secure so I have

1689.419 --> 1693.5
to figure out like what everybody's

1691.7 --> 1695.539
dealing with even if they don't want to

1693.5 --> 1697.159
share it with me that doesn't mean spy

1695.539 --> 1699.02
on them get the actual information but

1697.159 --> 1701.24
just decide everybody of where they at

1699.02 --> 1703.34
how are they like how stable are they

1701.24 --> 1706.76
how will they respond to the Ebbs and

1703.34 --> 1708.1399999999999
flows of craziness in the world

1706.76 --> 1711.14
right

1708.14 --> 1713.0
I'd be yeah I'm taking it a little far a

1711.14 --> 1715.22
lot of people probably don't have the

1713.0 --> 1717.14
talent to do it like that but you should

1715.22 --> 1720.02
take it as far as you can

1717.14 --> 1723.74
and apply yourself to the the best pure

1720.02 --> 1725.6
abilities and then that way

1723.74 --> 1728.6
you'd actually be kind of a social

1725.6 --> 1731.539
justice Warrior except not inside out

1728.6 --> 1733.82
Marxist totally [ __ ] up and supported

1731.539 --> 1735.1299999999999
by corporations and Grapplers

1733.82 --> 1737.6
all right

1735.13 --> 1740.0200000000002
[Music]

1737.6 --> 1740.02
okay

1741.44 --> 1746.179
anyway

1743.48 --> 1749.679
low Christian

1746.179 --> 1749.679
sleep with one eye open

1751.1 --> 1756.1899999999998
first time seeing me live oh okay

1753.26 --> 1759.279
Christian oh welcome to the Stream

1756.19 --> 1759.279
[Music]

1763.21 --> 1766.339
[Music]

1767.299 --> 1771.98
watch people comment on some of this

1769.279 --> 1774.76
podcast what's the last look yeah

1771.98 --> 1774.76
deranged

1776.299 --> 1782.24
but that's that's the irony right

1778.279 --> 1785.419
there's this Universal key irony

1782.24 --> 1788.6
like it's philosophical that is

1785.419 --> 1791.779
those that think they know everything

1788.6 --> 1793.039
know nothing and those that know they

1791.779 --> 1796.539
know nothing

1793.039 --> 1796.539
end up knowing everything

1799.76 --> 1804.74
huh

1801.62 --> 1810.08
it's a little ex expounding upon the

1804.74 --> 1810.08
original saying was it Aristotle

1814.659 --> 1820.419
why do I have so many haters probably

1817.64 --> 1820.419
jealousy

1833.059 --> 1838.76
could be a whole range of things

1836.48 --> 1841.52
but it's probably routed in jealousy

1838.76 --> 1844.76
because I really kind of like built this

1841.52 --> 1847.82
unique form of doing things for myself

1844.76 --> 1851.539
and being brutally open

1847.82 --> 1854.6589999999999
with it on at the same time which is

1851.539 --> 1857.12
that's really unusual for people to do

1854.659 --> 1860.1200000000001
that with their lives

1857.12 --> 1862.34
and to actually have like a vision for

1860.12 --> 1864.7399999999998
that at a young age even though at back

1862.34 --> 1867.32
then it didn't make sense and then that

1864.74 --> 1870.26
it still works somehow

1867.32 --> 1873.559
and people are just jealous of that it's

1870.26 --> 1875.899
like yeah but but I [ __ ] to all this and

1873.559 --> 1879.9189999999999
this stuff and now I want

1875.899 --> 1883.059
now I want that but I'm stuck

1879.919 --> 1883.0590000000002
and become bitter

1884.24 --> 1889.82
jealous like why

1887.299 --> 1893.98
it's like must be nice

1889.82 --> 1897.3799999999999
even though I am practically just poor

1893.98 --> 1900.679
yeah well it's hard to say even poor I

1897.38 --> 1903.5200000000002
mean I'm not totally poor I mean I have

1900.679 --> 1907.5800000000002
you guys have a successful show

1903.52 --> 1909.74
relatively successful I mean right

1907.58 --> 1912.3799999999999
it's but

1909.74 --> 1914.6
yeah all these people the anti-flatter

1912.38 --> 1917.179
for example have all these giant

1914.6 --> 1919.8799999999999
channels and people throw Super Chat at

1917.179 --> 1924.6200000000001
them right they get a lot of stuff

1919.88 --> 1927.279
yet they still feel incredibly

1924.62 --> 1927.279
shitty

1927.62 --> 1932.299
than when they come and visit my channel

1929.899 --> 1935.1789999999999
and then they want me to feel miserable

1932.299 --> 1939.46
for having less than them but I don't

1935.179 --> 1939.46
and that aggravates them even more

1940.059 --> 1945.6789999999999
I think that a lot of these [ __ ] up

1942.919 --> 1947.6000000000001
socks that really just want to get under

1945.679 --> 1949.3990000000001
your skin I think that they a lot of

1947.6 --> 1950.6589999999999
them are actually

1949.399 --> 1953.299
like

1950.659 --> 1956.6000000000001
rich kids

1953.299 --> 1959.48
sons of Bankers sons of government

1956.6 --> 1961.9399999999998
people that are and they know their

1959.48 --> 1963.799
parents are totally [ __ ] up evil they

1961.94 --> 1965.72
don't know how to get out of it they

1963.799 --> 1967.52
don't feel the confidence to really step

1965.72 --> 1970.46
out and lose everything

1967.52 --> 1971.72
basically that they that they you that

1970.46 --> 1974.1200000000001
they're used to and it makes them

1971.72 --> 1976.7
incredibly miserable I've met people

1974.12 --> 1978.86
like that that literally told me that

1976.7 --> 1981.8600000000001
like in my school

1978.86 --> 1983.899
there was a kid there and I thought it

1981.86 --> 1988.76
was kind of cool but he definitely had

1983.899 --> 1993.9799999999998
issues and he was like the son of the

1988.76 --> 1997.34
uh the WWF the world wild Foundation

1993.98 --> 2001.72
that that big one he was the Sun

1997.34 --> 2004.299
and he was like really cursed by it

2001.72 --> 2007.1200000000001
and and you could feel it off him he

2004.299 --> 2009.76
wasn't like uh he wasn't being a

2007.12 --> 2013.059
Grappler but he was really like it sucks

2009.76 --> 2014.62
because that guy is insane my dad is

2013.059 --> 2019.84
insane

2014.62 --> 2023.6789999999999
right I bet that a lot of kids like that

2019.84 --> 2026.4399999999998
that don't manage to basically actually

2023.679 --> 2028.72
retain some kind of a life for

2026.44 --> 2031.799
themselves in the face of all that that

2028.72 --> 2035.26
they end up just being super envious

2031.799 --> 2037.779
miserable trolls

2035.26 --> 2040.96
that are like they have

2037.779 --> 2043.059
they need to get by

2040.96 --> 2044.98
but they just don't feel like they

2043.059 --> 2047.019
deserve it and

2044.98 --> 2049.659
they don't know how to get out and so

2047.019 --> 2052.379
they're just like angry

2049.659 --> 2055.659
and they just want other people to not

2052.379 --> 2057.8199999999997
feel so relieved for not having that

2055.659 --> 2060.2200000000003
life not being in that position

2057.82 --> 2062.44
right

2060.22 --> 2065.7599999999998
and that's how they then start poking in

2062.44 --> 2065.76
such a maniacal way

2072.04 --> 2078.399
yeah so it is it is jealousy actually it

2075.399 --> 2081.0989999999997
is actual jealousy

2078.399 --> 2083.46
that makes the really bad Trolls do what

2081.099 --> 2083.46
they do

2083.859 --> 2088.359
I'm not talking about people that re

2086.139 --> 2091.599
that think that they're self-appointed

2088.359 --> 2094.96
correction teachers for mechanics

2091.599 --> 2097.9
as they Envision it right self-appointed

2094.96 --> 2099.46
teachers in chat there's some trolls

2097.9 --> 2101.98
that are even like that

2099.46 --> 2104.619
that's slightly different

2101.98 --> 2108.28
those are not the nasty ones those are

2104.619 --> 2111.099
just the really annoying persistent ones

2108.28 --> 2111.94
and they do sometimes catch you out on a

2111.099 --> 2113.6800000000003
mistake

2111.94 --> 2116.38
sometimes

2113.68 --> 2118.96
so I actually consider those types of

2116.38 --> 2120.94
people a bit like sparring partners and

2118.96 --> 2122.7400000000002
some of them even just eventually turn

2120.94 --> 2125.94
into regular

2122.74 --> 2125.9399999999996
people in my chat

2127.42 --> 2131.44
because what I eventually just want is

2129.339 --> 2133.7799999999997
that everybody just comes out for who

2131.44 --> 2137.44
they really are

2133.78 --> 2139.119
also to themselves

2137.44 --> 2141.099
come out

2139.119 --> 2144.359
for yourself

2141.099 --> 2144.3590000000004
to yourself

2145.06 --> 2151.42
I am a real person I have a solid

2148.359 --> 2154.06
identity when my chat account pops up

2151.42 --> 2156.94
everybody will know it's actually me

2154.06 --> 2158.92
because I don't keep changing my name I

2156.94 --> 2160.78
don't keep getting myself banned and

2158.92 --> 2163.78
making up new names

2160.78 --> 2166.7200000000003
and new accounts

2163.78 --> 2168.579
come out for yourself get some

2166.72 --> 2172.5989999999997
responsibility

2168.579 --> 2175.42
learn some basic manners figure out

2172.599 --> 2178.119
the social environment of a live stream

2175.42 --> 2180.2200000000003
and how to adapt

2178.119 --> 2182.52

2180.22 --> 2182.52

2205.26 --> 2210.5200000000004
I mean they'll just try to techno Babble

the [ __ ] out of you and they really

2210.52 --> 2214.72
think that they are winning when they do

2212.98 --> 2217.2400000000002
that

2214.72 --> 2219.8799999999997
so magical thinking it's literally like

2217.24 --> 2224.56
they're just performing Wizardry with

2219.88 --> 2228.3
technobabble and they make shortcuts

2224.56 --> 2228.2999999999997
and they really think it works

2230.14 --> 2236.52
right they don't actually take the time

2233.92 --> 2238.96
to take a look at the virtual

they don't actually do that

2247.3 --> 2251.6800000000003
if they did that then they would be more

2249.7 --> 2253.54
ballwinian

they don't do that

2258.94 --> 2264.16
they just build with the technobabble

2261.52 --> 2266.92
they make it work in their mind which

2264.16 --> 2269.2
has a lot of shortcuts and then they

2266.92 --> 2271.37
don't address that

the Flat Earth no they don't admit it to

themselves

2289.18 --> 2294.7
blank it out can't handle it

2292.359 --> 2296.859
or they can't deal with that right now

2294.7 --> 2298.72
that's really what happens they can't

2296.859 --> 2301.66
deal with it right now

2298.72 --> 2303.5789999999997
just put it on the long run and that

2301.66 --> 2307.06
eventually becomes this

2303.579 --> 2310.0
like this rolling what do you call it

2307.06 --> 2312.22
conveyor belt right into the trash can

2310.0 --> 2315.94

2323.32 --> 2326.56
out as like oh I can't deal with that

2324.64 --> 2328.68
right now and then they never deal with

2326.56 --> 2328.68
it

2329.5 --> 2333.16
they don't even have to say I can't deal

2331.359 --> 2336.5789999999997
with it right now they just

2333.16 --> 2340.0
do that that can it can feel it and it

2336.579 --> 2342.78
can see it spiritual metadata knowing

2340.0 --> 2342.78

2385.06 --> 2392.2
as to who is trolling not saying that

2388.24 --> 2396.0989999999997
every single kid of a rich person is a

2392.2 --> 2398.56
miserable [ __ ] I'm not saying that

2396.099 --> 2400.6600000000003

other

2405.339 --> 2410.14
family setups

2408.28 --> 2412.1800000000003

2410.14 --> 2415.2
Legends in the making in between there

2412.18 --> 2415.2
and it's like

2415.3 --> 2419.619
don't forget about the good ones if

2418.0 --> 2421.78
they're there you have to actually they

2419.619 --> 2425.079
have to actually prove that they're the

good ones by how they are

2425.079 --> 2431.8590000000004

some crazy bridge collapse in India

2457.24 --> 2464.2
that you take it out of that

2464.2 --> 2471.7
there were like over a hundred people

2468.16 --> 2474.04
got killed in that and [ __ ] crazy

2471.7 --> 2475.96
it's like this walking bridge

2539.38 --> 2542.76
it people talking about it

unless there are some pure

on to like figure out some puzzle for

some people right

2560.619 --> 2565.599
really interests me about it because

2562.18 --> 2567.52
like all that mechanic talk and like all

2565.599 --> 2569.92
this and that house is gonna have uh

2567.52 --> 2572.88

don't like people talking about it all

2626.44 --> 2629.859
the time

2627.7 --> 2631.96
I mean that'll just bore me

and but that pretty much happens with

2631.96 --> 2634.5
any sport

2636.48 --> 2640.72
I mean I think that at this point the

2639.04 --> 2644.079
only thing that could actually make me

2640.72 --> 2646.2999999999997
really like a sport if is if I'm like in

2644.079 --> 2649.6600000000003
love with a girl that's really into one

2646.3 --> 2653.8
sport then I'd probably really start

2649.66 --> 2656.2799999999997
getting into that sport because well you

2653.8 --> 2659.319
know why

2700.42 --> 2706.119
completely ruin

2703.599 --> 2708.9
like my week or something

2706.119 --> 2708.9
I don't know

2713.14 --> 2717.18
I guess that if I'd like really focus on

2715.66 --> 2720.5789999999997
it then

2717.18 --> 2722.68
proper but yeah proper financial backing

2720.579 --> 2726.1600000000003
for it and

2722.68 --> 2728.6189999999997
the right supplements really combining

2726.16 --> 2730.56
it with food then it probably will get

2728.619 --> 2734.579
right back into it but it's just like

2730.56 --> 2739.9
I'm near mind sports

2734.579 --> 2742.9
that's my field my field is mental

2739.9 --> 2745.98
I'm not a physical guy really except

2742.9 --> 2745.98
yeah no

2746.14 --> 2752.46
I mean I'm not throwing the physical

2747.94 --> 2752.46
away I still take care of it

2753.04 --> 2756.72
anyway oh God

2764.5 --> 2773.22
karate karate cool

2769.42 --> 2773.2200000000003
yeah I never got into karate

2773.56 --> 2777.66
but I didn't get into Taekwondo

2780.339 --> 2785.5
which is

2782.14 --> 2787.1189999999997
more performative really than it is

2785.5 --> 2790.18
like a

2787.119 --> 2792.4
more yeah a martial art well no it is a

2790.18 --> 2794.94
martial art but it's it really is more

2792.4 --> 2794.94
performative

2799.96 --> 2807.339
but yeah I got into it really to

2804.819 --> 2809.5
train my balance that's like that's

2807.339 --> 2811.7799999999997
that's the skill that I really ended up

2809.5 --> 2813.099
being able to train during Taekwondo was

2811.78 --> 2816.579
my balance

2813.099 --> 2819.7000000000003
because I have a very good balance

2816.579 --> 2822.2200000000003
because I train it all my life

2819.7 --> 2826.839
like because I was born I trained my

2822.22 --> 2830.2
balance all my life because I was bored

2826.839 --> 2832.92
so I'm really good at balancing

2830.2 --> 2832.9199999999996
like

2833.92 --> 2841.06
really good at it dare I say so good

2837.4 --> 2844.2400000000002
that even if I'm like pretty damn tipsy

2841.06 --> 2846.4
I'll still just I'll be able to

2844.24 --> 2849.9599999999996
perfectly walk that line

2846.4 --> 2849.96
with my eyes closed now

2853.119 --> 2858.78
I have in the past

2855.339 --> 2861.52
when I was like blatantly noticeably

2858.78 --> 2863.079
under influence and still of the balance

2861.52 --> 2864.64
like because I have a really good

2863.079 --> 2867.4
balance because I train it all my life

2864.64 --> 2870.52
because I was bored so much literally

2867.4 --> 2872.8
like bored as in like relatively young

2870.52 --> 2874.839
and I'm just like yeah there's people

2872.8 --> 2877.8390000000004
that doing the chatting is boring and

2874.839 --> 2881.14
I'm like what can I do I like how long

2877.839 --> 2884.56
can I stand on one foot

2881.14 --> 2887.2599999999998
right for example just one stupid little

2884.56 --> 2890.5
example just that sort of stuff I would

2887.26 --> 2894.119
do it out of boredom and it got really

2890.5 --> 2894.119
good because of it anyway

2894.16 --> 2898.54
and Taekwondo also assisted

2896.68 --> 2901.66
that's how I was able to do a very

2898.54 --> 2904.3
interesting things that I can never do

2901.66 --> 2907.2999999999997
again but like a

2904.3 --> 2911.02
what do you call that a backspin double

2907.3 --> 2914.2000000000003
kick with both legs

2911.02 --> 2916.839
which wasn't technically even a move in

2914.2 --> 2919.839
Taekwondo and I literally did that at an

2916.839 --> 2922.2999999999997
exam and everybody was like or like the

2919.839 --> 2923.7999999999997
judges were like that's not a registered

2922.3 --> 2929.099
move

2923.8 --> 2929.099
that's interesting that was it right

2935.8 --> 2937.92
yeah

2938.02 --> 2942.9
but yeah my Taekwondo days was pretty

2940.24 --> 2942.8999999999996
much between

2943.66 --> 2948.46
between 12 and 17 that's when I was

2947.319 --> 2952.839
really

2948.46 --> 2955.119
in the max in the optimal skill range

2952.839 --> 2957.96
for for those things

2955.119 --> 2957.96
anyway

2961.66 --> 2966.64
you'd probably be good at gymnastics

2964.24 --> 2969.5789999999997
well not so much anymore now I could

2966.64 --> 2971.74
still probably do a few things I would

2969.579 --> 2973.7200000000003
still seem very young I could make

2971.74 --> 2976.06
myself seem very young by still doing

2973.72 --> 2977.98
some stuff but I would never like try to

2976.06 --> 2979.839
push the boundaries again like that

2977.98 --> 2986.64
because it yeah

2979.839 --> 2986.64
but I used to love Jim I loved Jim

2990.52 --> 2995.579
except if I ate too much candy or had

2992.859 --> 2995.5789999999997
terrible sleep

2995.8 --> 2999.6600000000003
then I would not love Jim

3000.119 --> 3005.6400000000003
but I liked it because it was like it

3002.88 --> 3007.2000000000003
was that moment in the day where you

3005.64 --> 3009.72
could just like

3007.2 --> 3011.9399999999996
like [ __ ] it now I can finally switch

3009.72 --> 3012.5899999999997
off my mind for a second and just get

3011.94 --> 3013.98
physical

3012.59 --> 3017.359
[Music]

3013.98 --> 3017.359
right I like that

3033.72 --> 3037.3999999999996
would you attributed one

3037.68 --> 3044.06
would you would I attribute what for my

3041.22 --> 3044.06
strong mentality

3062.099 --> 3065.42
oh take one now

3066.9 --> 3072.42
in a way yeah

3069.359 --> 3074.52
I still have because I wasn't a really

3072.42 --> 3076.38
weird period that time where I was very

3074.52 --> 3079.14
confused

3076.38 --> 3082.98
and I still remember that at one point I

3079.14 --> 3085.14
was actually like getting a bit sgw

3082.98 --> 3086.04
like on one of the teachers just a

3085.14 --> 3087.9
little

3086.04 --> 3090.0589999999997
and I really thought I was doing the

3087.9 --> 3092.94
right thing and then he like totally

3090.059 --> 3094.8
disapproved and I was like a total

3092.94 --> 3097.339
shocker to me

3094.8 --> 3100.8
and I didn't go all like

3097.339 --> 3102.9
63 cents because well I've never even

3100.8 --> 3104.2200000000003
seen anybody do that and why the hell

3102.9 --> 3106.6800000000003
would I do that because I totally

3104.22 --> 3108.5989999999997
respected that teacher that's a pretty

3106.68 --> 3110.5789999999997
cool guy

3108.599 --> 3112.8590000000004
and he like did

3110.579 --> 3116.78
like more professional

3112.859 --> 3118.859
Taekwondo too I think even at some point

3116.78 --> 3120.8390000000004
participated in the national

3118.859 --> 3123.7999999999997
championships or something I don't know

3120.839 --> 3123.7999999999997
but

3124.44 --> 3129.54
I had a lot of like there were some

3127.02 --> 3132.0
really awesome role models

3129.54 --> 3135.359
that I met

3132.0 --> 3137.579
and could basically look up to it during

3135.359 --> 3142.04
my Taekwondo

3137.579 --> 3144.42
so it's funny in a way it kind of was

3142.04 --> 3146.7799999999997
my Cobra Kai

3144.42 --> 3146.78
time

3146.819 --> 3153.72
but there was no actual fighting or a

3149.819 --> 3156.3
day dude there had been occasions where

3153.72 --> 3159.0589999999997
fights had broken out and those people

3156.3 --> 3162.48
would like be kicked out forever so they

3159.059 --> 3165.8590000000004
were really very strict against people

3162.48 --> 3165.859
that would actually fight

3167.78 --> 3176.099
like outside of sparring or matches

3173.52 --> 3178.2
or that would break the rules so oh yeah

3176.099 --> 3180.42
PayPal I've completely forgotten

3178.2 --> 3183.74
Julio cabin you told me and then I got

3180.42 --> 3183.7400000000002
caught up I will check it

3189.9 --> 3194.819
all right so every time also when I see

3192.24 --> 3197.22
Cobra Kai I just it's like I really like

3194.819 --> 3199.819
the series overall but it's totally

3197.22 --> 3199.819
insane

3201.319 --> 3206.64
I mean it's crazy to me to see that [ __ ]

3204.599 --> 3208.6800000000003
happening it's like wow that's like

3206.64 --> 3210.54
totally out of control

3208.68 --> 3213.359
and it's someone yeah it's like funny to

3210.54 --> 3216.44
me because I've never seen anything like

3213.359 --> 3216.44
that happen in reality

3219.78 --> 3227.42
whoa thank you Julia

3222.839 --> 3227.42
Julio thank you very much

3227.819 --> 3230.24
it's pretty

3232.92 --> 3238.64
I really appreciate the support man

3235.8 --> 3238.6400000000003
thank you

3242.64 --> 3248.54
double quotes now

3245.94 --> 3248.54
come on

3266.24 --> 3270.9599999999996
anybody here that like our financial

3269.04 --> 3274.319
Minister here in the Netherlands is

3270.96 --> 3276.8
going to actually try to

3274.319 --> 3280.02
like

3276.8 --> 3281.52
mandate that

3280.02 --> 3286.5
that like

3281.52 --> 3289.14
transaction data above 100 euros with

3286.5 --> 3291.8
like Dutch banks have to be like

3289.14 --> 3291.7999999999997
registered

3292.02 --> 3296.94
pretty insane

3294.66 --> 3299.66
but I don't think it's to me personally

3296.94 --> 3303.059
not very problematic but that is like a

3299.66 --> 3305.5789999999997
insane privacy violation

3303.059 --> 3307.8590000000004
that's happening

3305.579 --> 3309.78
apparently

3307.859 --> 3313.0989999999997
keep the chat rolling indeed hey

3309.78 --> 3313.099
geoshifter good to see you

3336.78 --> 3342.02
everyone here is in good health I think

3339.42 --> 3342.02
so Julio

3344.16 --> 3349.5
I mean uh

3346.92 --> 3351.54
Robert constant of Rome

3349.5 --> 3353.579
has been through like a pretty risky

3351.54 --> 3357.119
operation recently but he seemed to have

3353.579 --> 3360.119
come out perfectly successful

3357.119 --> 3364.04
so yeah of course we're leaving I think

3360.119 --> 3364.04
everybody else here is uh is fine

3364.5 --> 3369.72
although all those people when was it

3367.02 --> 3371.94
last year and the year before that were

3369.72 --> 3373.3799999999997
all like you know I did I took the facts

3371.94 --> 3377.3
no problem

3373.38 --> 3377.3
haven't seen those back yet

3377.46 --> 3382.819
so I think that in a lot of my actual

3379.98 --> 3387.559
predictions at the time are rough

3382.819 --> 3387.5589999999997
judgments probably came true

3389.819 --> 3394.92
but yeah

3392.099 --> 3397.44
until they for some reason pop up but

3394.92 --> 3400.02
then again never got to see any of their

3397.44 --> 3401.76
faces anyway

3400.02 --> 3405.619
uh

3401.76 --> 3405.619
nice holiday here in Belgium okay

3405.839 --> 3409.4
holiday what holiday

3417.35 --> 3420.5099999999998
[Music]

3436.52 --> 3441.02
oh Belgium vacation

3443.88 --> 3450.119
they go visit the graveyard what okay

3447.44 --> 3452.04
well that's very Catholic

3450.119 --> 3454.92
then

3452.04 --> 3457.2799999999997
sounds that sounds like a very Catholic

3454.92 --> 3457.28
thing

3461.099 --> 3465.7200000000003
all the holy ones and then go visit

3463.38 --> 3468.059
graveyards because yeah graveyards are

3465.72 --> 3470.64
pretty Catholic

3468.059 --> 3473.1800000000003
right traditionally they would always

3470.64 --> 3473.18
bury

3474.24 --> 3477.859
hmm all right

3481.559 --> 3489.0
that's that's a bit weird by the way

3485.099 --> 3492.1800000000003
because that sounds very adjacent to

3489.0 --> 3494.46
Halloween right I mean it's pretty much

3492.18 --> 3498.0589999999997
on the date and why would you visit

3494.46 --> 3500.64
graveyards because maybe the dead are

3498.059 --> 3502.44
like closer to you so you could actually

3500.64 --> 3506.18
have a chat

3502.44 --> 3506.18
that you know what I mean

3506.88 --> 3511.859
I mean not

3508.38 --> 3513.75
super overt about it but it is kind of

3511.859 --> 3515.94
a funny coincidence

3513.75 --> 3519.0
[Music]

3515.94 --> 3521.7000000000003
I have the same holiday in Poland huh

3519.0 --> 3525.72
well Poland is traditionally super

3521.7 --> 3527.66
Catholic so that makes sense

3525.72 --> 3531.0
I guess that

3527.66 --> 3533.16
or the all holy

3531.0 --> 3535.4
I don't know how it would be called in

3533.16 --> 3535.3999999999996
English

3535.559 --> 3543.599
is just a uh is like the the Catholic

3540.9 --> 3546.299
Halloween it's like their Halloween

3543.599 --> 3548.4
thingy but instead of like the in

3546.299 --> 3550.5
elaborate stuff

3548.4 --> 3553.94
it's just no just

3550.5 --> 3553.94
everybody visits the grave

3554.819 --> 3559.319
and I mean it could be an interesting

3556.859 --> 3561.54
social opportunity but everybody did

3559.319 --> 3563.16
that and yeah you're gonna have like a

3561.54 --> 3565.5
lot of people around

3563.16 --> 3568.6189999999997
that are potentially gonna have stories

3565.5 --> 3571.619
about well bear loved ones that died and

3568.619 --> 3573.299
yeah I mean see it's kind of a communal

3571.619 --> 3577.319
opportunity

3573.299 --> 3580.2599999999998
to talk about some of that stuff

3577.319 --> 3582.0
so yeah

3580.26 --> 3583.92
I mean why not

3582.0 --> 3586.03
sounds more sensible to me than

3583.92 --> 3589.129
Halloween really

3586.03 --> 3589.1290000000004
[Music]

3597.24 --> 3602.4799999999996
glad blood test oh what

3605.28 --> 3609.0
okay

3606.599 --> 3610.92
all right yeah good luck

3609.0 --> 3613.94
thanks for being in the chat PJ Cru

3610.92 --> 3613.94
shank and see you tomorrow

3615.07 --> 3619.079
[Music]

3621.86 --> 3625.05
[Music]

3628.95 --> 3634.68
[Music]

3631.2 --> 3636.7799999999997
yeah well most of you might have noticed

3634.68 --> 3639.48
that I've not really did anything

3636.78 --> 3642.3590000000004
Halloween stuff because I'm just not

3639.48 --> 3644.46
really into Halloween because

3642.359 --> 3646.38
there is

3644.46 --> 3650.52
well let's just say it's because I'm an

3646.38 --> 3652.44
empath okay and I've seen freaky [ __ ]

3650.52 --> 3655.4
happen during Halloween

3652.44 --> 3655.4
not good

3657.24 --> 3661.6189999999997
I mean there's some

3659.22 --> 3664.5
weirdo people out there that sometimes

3661.619 --> 3666.2400000000002
that some of them go really they I've

3664.5 --> 3668.839
seen people become possessed and go

3666.24 --> 3668.839
berserk

3669.119 --> 3674.2200000000003
during Halloween

3671.28 --> 3677.1800000000003
totally out of nowhere like people that

3674.22 --> 3680.5789999999997
would never do that so

3677.18 --> 3681.839
I am very like you know Halloween you

3680.579 --> 3684.9
should probably be a little bit more

3681.839 --> 3688.5789999999997
careful and like not get all high on

3684.9 --> 3688.579
sugar right because

3688.68 --> 3693.24
sugar is just another form of spirits in

3691.38 --> 3695.52
that sense I mean it's not as dramatic

3693.24 --> 3698.16
as alcohol and of course kids you should

3695.52 --> 3699.72
never give them milk however

3698.16 --> 3702.8999999999996
but

3699.72 --> 3706.319
even sugar right it any type of

3702.9 --> 3708.9
substance that is addictive will have

3706.319 --> 3711.72
like that Spirits effect so you

3708.9 --> 3714.299
shouldn't be getting high on sugar on

3711.72 --> 3717.48
Halloween actually that would be very

3714.299 --> 3721.4
dangerous or well not very it would be

3717.48 --> 3721.4
more dangerous than average

3721.859 --> 3725.819
right

3723.24 --> 3728.819
all these things all just contribute to

3725.819 --> 3732.24
the possibility that well one of these

3728.819 --> 3733.92
dark Spirits from the other side not all

3732.24 --> 3736.68
of them are potentially dark but some

3733.92 --> 3740.2200000000003
might be might actually slip through and

3736.68 --> 3743.22
catch you possess you

3740.22 --> 3745.5589999999997
that's what I literally think

3743.22 --> 3748.319
about Halloween

3745.559 --> 3750.9
and I I still appreciate it in a way

3748.319 --> 3752.579
like oh yeah the the spooky themed

3750.9 --> 3756.599
things and

3752.579 --> 3759.1800000000003
and like a creepy crawly movies

3756.599 --> 3760.5
I do kind of appreciate them

3759.18 --> 3763.0789999999997
[Music]

3760.5 --> 3765.18
except when I feel really depressed and

3763.079 --> 3765.8390000000004
then I run away from them as much as I

3765.18 --> 3767.7
can

3765.839 --> 3768.359
because then it's really unhealthy for

3767.7 --> 3770.96
me

3768.359 --> 3770.96
but

3771.599 --> 3776.54
to me Halloween is kind of risky

3779.94 --> 3785.099
and now I'm not gonna go with oh it's

3782.4 --> 3788.1600000000003
all super spooky they used to sacrifice

3785.099 --> 3790.559
people and get like Ultra

3788.16 --> 3793.2
ancient paganism

3790.559 --> 3796.5
with human sacrifice [ __ ] I mean yeah

3793.2 --> 3799.22
that probably did happen some of it it's

3796.5 --> 3799.22
really [ __ ] up

3799.559 --> 3804.7200000000003
but that doesn't automatically make it

3802.02 --> 3807.78
that but yeah

3804.72 --> 3811.74
I mean the spirits of the Dead

3807.78 --> 3813.2400000000002
that might include people that did do

3811.74 --> 3815.52
that sort of [ __ ]

3813.24 --> 3817.9399999999996
so who knows what you could potentially

3815.52 --> 3820.4
attract

3817.94 --> 3824.04
including in your

3820.4 --> 3826.7400000000002
digging research online into like oh

3824.04 --> 3829.2599999999998
what kind of a theme am I gonna do now

3826.74 --> 3831.5989999999997
well you might stumble upon [ __ ] that's

3829.26 --> 3833.6400000000003
actually really [ __ ] up

3831.599 --> 3835.6800000000003
and then think like oh well that's

3833.64 --> 3838.94
creepy enough but who knows what you

3835.68 --> 3842.0989999999997
might unleash on yourself by even

3838.94 --> 3843.119
entangling with some [ __ ] up [ __ ] out

3842.099 --> 3845.6400000000003
there

3843.119 --> 3849.96
right especially if you have

3845.64 --> 3852.1189999999997
not a very stable moral sensor that you

3849.96 --> 3854.16
have slight psychopathy Tendencies

3852.119 --> 3856.02
because you just don't really see oh is

3854.16 --> 3859.14
this too far I don't really know for

3856.02 --> 3862.2
sure right well you can then also roll

3859.14 --> 3866.22
into some [ __ ] up [ __ ]

3862.2 --> 3866.22
foreign Halloween

3866.94 --> 3871.92
because there's like dark pranksters

3869.22 --> 3875.339
also during Halloween

3871.92 --> 3877.799
there's like evil warlock people that

3875.339 --> 3881.64
sounds funny to you maybe but they're

3877.799 --> 3883.94
out there and they do try to [ __ ] with

3881.64 --> 3883.94
people

3889.2 --> 3894.8999999999996
and I yeah being subjected to that a bit

3892.799 --> 3898.559
myself

3894.9 --> 3900.92
right and you're just lucky if they just

3898.559 --> 3904.1400000000003
really start all the [ __ ] out of you

3900.92 --> 3906.9
maybe give you a heart attack and not

3904.14 --> 3910.319
anything worse

3906.9 --> 3912.9
right anyway I'm not going to be easily

3910.319 --> 3915.98
scared now besides scaring me can be

3912.9 --> 3915.98
potentially dangerous

3917.28 --> 3925.559
I have like pretty serious reflexes

3921.839 --> 3927.7799999999997
for in case that's sadly somebody comes

3925.559 --> 3929.52
storming into

3927.78 --> 3934.1600000000003
to get me

3929.52 --> 3934.16
this yeah it's just it's there

3939.059 --> 3944.6600000000003
your kids refuse to wash your car and

3941.94 --> 3944.66
keep gaming

3945.0 --> 3949.74
you need a basement

3947.64 --> 3951.3799999999997
yeah or you just need control over your

3949.74 --> 3955.5
kids

3951.38 --> 3958.52
I mean who's owning the house

3955.5 --> 3958.52
Piero shifter

3961.319 --> 3969.96
shock collar okay

3965.22 --> 3969.9599999999996
over the edge there but uh

3970.799 --> 3976.46
wash the car yourself oh you're a

3973.859 --> 3976.46
terrible dad

3977.22 --> 3983.8999999999996
you're terrible

3979.92 --> 3983.9
you need to discipline your kids bro

3986.099 --> 3991.619
I mean not doing what you're saying

3989.4 --> 3996.38
because they're gaming is like the worst

3991.619 --> 3996.38
reason to disobey a parent ever

3996.92 --> 4002.38
and yes I've done that quite a few in my

4000.319 --> 4005.48
time my parents were very strict though

4002.38 --> 4007.579
and even though I was really pissed off

4005.48 --> 4009.619
at them for that at times

4007.579 --> 4011.3590000000004
afterward I'm kind of happy that they

4009.619 --> 4014.2400000000002
did because otherwise I might have

4011.359 --> 4017.0
become like a real gamer head that was

4014.24 --> 4020.9799999999996
just uh

4017.0 --> 4020.98
escaping in it Non-Stop

4022.66 --> 4025.8799999999997
[Music]

4026.9 --> 4031.64
I allow them every well okay

4029.539 --> 4034.42
I hope you're not proud of that because

4031.64 --> 4034.42
you shouldn't be

4036.26 --> 4043.1800000000003
yeah kids need guidance they need

4038.66 --> 4043.18
discipline or they'll get stuck in Loops

4044.2 --> 4050.359
yeah if kids don't learn discipline but

4048.5 --> 4051.859
they do get to spend a lot of time

4050.359 --> 4056.14
gaming you know what that's going to

4051.859 --> 4056.14
lead to focusing problems

4057.32 --> 4060.559
[Music]

4063.16 --> 4069.92
yeah you need discipline as a kid

4067.099 --> 4070.54
for your concentration ability you need

4069.92 --> 4074.48
that

4070.54 --> 4076.7599999999998
[Music]

4074.48 --> 4080.42
anyway I'll stop

4076.76 --> 4082.28
meddling with your private life Affairs

4080.42 --> 4085.04
now

4082.28 --> 4087.619
but I did feel I need to say that

4085.04 --> 4090.38
[Music]

4087.619 --> 4092.299
no it doesn't akumu virus and I'm not

4090.38 --> 4095.48
talking about gaming in general I'm

4092.299 --> 4098.239
talking about gaming

4095.48 --> 4101.12
and not discipline

4098.239 --> 4104.839
yeah so if you game and your parents

4101.12 --> 4108.5
just let you do that instead of actually

4104.839 --> 4112.4
well making you learn doing tasks

4108.5 --> 4115.339
responsibility building skill

4112.4 --> 4118.759
you need that if you don't they'll get

4115.339 --> 4122.0
focusing problems not it's not default

4118.759 --> 4124.42
the gaming it's the combination that

4122.0 --> 4124.42
does it

4125.92 --> 4131.359
what are you talking about your sentence

4128.239 --> 4134.3589999999995
don't come through yes they do

4131.359 --> 4134.359
foreign

4146.0 --> 4149.08
what are you talking about

4155.609 --> 4158.728
[Music]

4159.679 --> 4163.42
yeah I don't care a Como virus

4163.64 --> 4168.319
I know what I'm talking about

4166.64 --> 4170.839
yeah

4168.319 --> 4173.839000000001
I'm a gamer in a way

4170.839 --> 4176.6
but there's a time in your life

4173.839 --> 4178.8189999999995
when gaming is really just a distraction

4176.6 --> 4180.38
and you as a kid will use it for

4178.819 --> 4184.04
escapism

4180.38 --> 4186.799
and then even yeah if you got a parent

4184.04 --> 4189.679
that just doesn't make yeah doesn't have

4186.799 --> 4191.7789999999995
authority over you loses their authority

4189.679 --> 4195.819
over you and you just keep gaming it's

4191.779 --> 4195.819
gonna lead to concentration problems

4196.84 --> 4202.64
because you need

4199.94 --> 4203.78
that discipline especially when you're

4202.64 --> 4208.0
young

4203.78 --> 4208.0
can't always just do what you want

4209.29 --> 4213.5
[Music]

4210.52 --> 4215.900000000001
better would be altogether to not give

4213.5 --> 4218.44
them gaming stations

4215.9 --> 4218.44
at all

4219.02 --> 4226.6990000000005
until maybe they're like 15 or something

4223.58 --> 4228.62
serious yeah no my friends yeah yeah and

4226.699 --> 4231.799999999999

4233.3 --> 4236.360000000001
they were young in their mobiles yeah

4234.86 --> 4238.159
yeah guess what is going to happen with

4236.36 --> 4240.799999999999
them in 10 or 20 years

4238.159 --> 4244.219
you're gonna be [ __ ] retards and

4240.8 --> 4248.62
they're gonna have health problems

4244.219 --> 4248.62

4258.26 --> 4263.84
okay geoshifter well it's your business

RP 12 vacation what

4338.06 --> 4342.9400000000005
hello

4339.86 --> 4342.94
what are you talking about

4380.659 --> 4387.62
nothing okay great

4384.739 --> 4391.959999999999
just throw it out there don't tell me

4387.62 --> 4391.96
why what it has to do with anything

foreign

4397.08 --> 4403.72
[Music]

4410.36 --> 4418.179
okay so this guy Fox that you mentioned

4416.6 --> 4420.320000000001
he was

4418.179 --> 4423.5
anti-catholic I guess it was a

4420.32 --> 4427.04
Protestant he does look at the like

4423.5 --> 4428.3
and he joined in the 80 years war all

4427.04 --> 4430.96
right

4428.3 --> 4430.96
okay

4441.5 --> 4446.9
the RP 12 vacation it would be great

4444.199 --> 4449.178999999999
though if you could potentially make

4446.9 --> 4452.12
more cohesive sense in your

4449.179 --> 4454.89
communication as to like why you're

4452.12 --> 4458.089
bringing that up at all

4454.89 --> 4458.089
[Music]

4458.84 --> 4461.84
foreign

4491.719 --> 4494.679
foreign

4514.96 --> 4520.64
why are you talking about Druids now I

4517.699 --> 4524.5
mean I'm fine with that but

4520.64 --> 4524.5
I'm just wondering why

4526.1 --> 4529.06
it's because of

4530.719 --> 4533.9800000000005
the Halloween

4532.05 --> 4537.56
[Music]

4533.98 --> 4540.5599999999995
I did watch a video I mean I am kind of

4537.56 --> 4542.96
enjoying this channel

4540.56 --> 4544.3
who recommended it to me but a Hugo

4542.96 --> 4547.52
talks

4544.3 --> 4551.360000000001
interesting little videos

4547.52 --> 4553.4800000000005
I've been really enjoying them

4551.36 --> 4553.48
yeah

4553.6 --> 4559.9400000000005
I have this take pretty paranoid take on

4557.96 --> 4563.659
Halloween

4559.94 --> 4566.419999999999
very oh I'm we're so Christian

4563.659 --> 4568.699
type of angle of approach

4566.42 --> 4569.96
which to me is like getting kind of old

4568.699 --> 4571.5199999999995
but

4569.96 --> 4573.58
still yeah

4571.52 --> 4577.040000000001
I guess uh

4573.58 --> 4579.38
that The Druids were like evolved in

4577.04 --> 4581.9
really [ __ ] up rituals

4579.38 --> 4584.56
in ancient times and and really did go

4581.9 --> 4589.9
as far as to do just the human sacrifice

4584.56 --> 4589.900000000001
to attempt to appease the dark spirits

4590.179 --> 4594.04
which is [ __ ] insane

4602.9 --> 4609.86
but yeah then again maybe like were

4605.96 --> 4611.54
those really Druids why they're like

4609.86 --> 4615.259999999999
I don't know

4611.54 --> 4619.4
I still suspect that like those might be

4615.26 --> 4622.88
like the [ __ ] up Druids or their

4619.4 --> 4625.599999999999
grabblers or something I don't know man

4622.88 --> 4630.14
I don't really understand it's

4625.6 --> 4632.120000000001
Druids are kind of of a completely

4630.14 --> 4635.56
different era

4632.12 --> 4635.5599999999995
so I don't even know

4637.9 --> 4643.219
[Music]

4640.1 --> 4646.0
I mean to me it could just as well just

4643.219 --> 4646.0
be slander

4652.699 --> 4659.919999999999
I mean

4654.199 --> 4659.919999999999
the Beast system typically does do that

4659.96 --> 4666.9800000000005
right oh a real opponent okay well

4664.82 --> 4670.28
destroy them

4666.98 --> 4673.339999999999
then basically skin them and put their

4670.28 --> 4675.62
skin on and then you become it and then

4673.34 --> 4678.679
you ruin it and then you turn it into

4675.62 --> 4681.46
another evil satanic Rebel system

4678.679 --> 4681.46
underneath it

4683.5 --> 4686.56
all right

4690.8 --> 4697.46
I mean the secret society [ __ ] they also

4694.52 --> 4700.040000000001
love the reference Druids

4697.46 --> 4703.159
well that you cannot seriously think

4700.04 --> 4705.5
that that really has a legitimate

4703.159 --> 4708.799999999999
spiritual connection with the original

4705.5 --> 4710.96
Druids there is no way in hell that

4708.8 --> 4713.320000000001
those would ever approve anything about

4710.96 --> 4713.32
this

4715.58 --> 4722.179
unless they were just [ __ ] evil or

4719.48 --> 4725.0599999999995
some of them again they might have their

4722.179 --> 4727.58
evil possessed ones right I don't know

4725.06 --> 4731.06
what Druids were doing maybe they were

4727.58 --> 4734.48
like a bit Oracle like too and maybe

4731.06 --> 4736.34
they did like let Spirits possess them

4734.48 --> 4738.199
and some might be angels and some might

4736.34 --> 4741.14
be devils and

4738.199 --> 4743.178999999999
I don't know I have no idea what what

4741.14 --> 4746.06
they really did

4743.179 --> 4747.08
and neither does anybody because it's so

4746.06 --> 4749.4800000000005
long ago

4747.08 --> 4752.0599999999995
there's no original trace of it really

4749.48 --> 4754.718999999999
and it's very likely that all the

4752.06 --> 4757.820000000001
information we even get has been

4754.719 --> 4760.34
manipulated by the secret societies that

4757.82 --> 4763.54
have assimilated it

4760.34 --> 4763.54
to corrupt it

4764.9 --> 4769.179
that's what I really think about Druids

4770.12 --> 4772.84
anyway

4805.219 --> 4810.049
all right

4806.85 --> 4810.049
[Music]

4812.12 --> 4817.4
man this Winter's so freaking beautiful

4814.52 --> 4819.64
like I kind of want to stand outside for

4817.4 --> 4819.639999999999
a while

4820.3 --> 4824.92
you guys scuffle around in chat

4826.58 --> 4831.82
sometimes I wonder if you're even

4828.26 --> 4831.820000000001
listening to what I'm talking

4832.28 --> 4834.88
about seeing

4879.38 --> 4884.06
ah that was nice okay now I'm actually

4881.6 --> 4885.679
gonna take a two minute break be right

4884.06 --> 4888.679
back

4885.679 --> 4888.679
foreign

4925.58 --> 4928.0
foreign

4959.06 --> 4962.06
foreign

4984.44 --> 4988.849999999999
[Music]

4991.34 --> 4997.6990000000005
needed and break also it's just I I kind

4995.36 --> 5000.04
of want to absorb this sun

4997.699 --> 5001.299999999999
I'm I was just being drawn towards the

5000.04 --> 5003.699
Sun

5001.3 --> 5006.04
yeah I'm not bored with this Channel at

5003.699 --> 5008.58
all I mean I think I've had a really

5006.04 --> 5012.219
good show today

5008.58 --> 5015.28
especially at the start

5012.219 --> 5017.38
it's a great idea

5015.28 --> 5020.5
very focused

5017.38 --> 5022.900000000001
I think today is one of my better shows

5020.5 --> 5024.4
it's funny and what I wanted to say like

5022.9 --> 5026.679
it might be the best show of the month

5024.4 --> 5029.94
well it's the first show of this month

5026.679 --> 5029.9400000000005
the month of November

5031.96 --> 5035.219
so I'm doing great

5046.96 --> 5052.02
here's your phone to do yours

5050.199 --> 5054.159
or what you mean

5052.02 --> 5057.280000000001
this phone

5054.159 --> 5060.28
am I gonna use this phone

5057.28 --> 5062.5
to do a stream outside am I really

5060.28 --> 5065.08
really am I

5062.5 --> 5067.42
no

5065.08 --> 5070.08
this thing does not have live streaming

5067.42 --> 5070.08
capabilities

5070.42 --> 5074.7390000000005
or what

5072.219 --> 5076.84
no it has recording I could do actually

5074.739 --> 5078.759999999999
a little video recording but not a very

5076.84 --> 5080.26
long one that's what I could do with

5078.76 --> 5081.64
this at best

5080.26 --> 5084.84
so

5081.64 --> 5084.84
that's it dude

5102.76 --> 5109.5
oh

5105.1 --> 5109.5
it would be at first to stream on that

5122.14 --> 5126.54
kick Globes out why

5135.159 --> 5138.42
what did they do wrong

5143.56 --> 5149.860000000001
I mean just because they persistently

5146.58 --> 5151.719
religiously and fanatically unabatedly

5149.86 --> 5153.099999999999
believe in something that is completely

5151.719 --> 5154.96
[ __ ]

5153.1 --> 5156.52
doesn't mean that I have to kick them

5154.96 --> 5157.659
out

5156.52 --> 5160.06
it's just

5157.659 --> 5162.5199999999995
yeah little challenge right we're just

5160.06 --> 5163.360000000001
gonna have to deal with it and well why

5162.52 --> 5164.860000000001
not

5163.36 --> 5168.46
instead of

5164.86 --> 5171.159
bumping your heads in the fact that we

5168.46 --> 5173.38
could never get them to stop doing that

5171.159 --> 5174.46
and they might feel the same about us in

5173.38 --> 5177.46
that way

5174.46 --> 5180.159
we can at least just focus then on just

5177.46 --> 5182.92
good behavior why don't we just behave

5180.159 --> 5185.92
and then we could get go get along

5182.92 --> 5190.6
together to some degree

5185.92 --> 5193.12
under the guise of good behavior

5190.6 --> 5196.8
how about that

5193.12 --> 5196.8
that's what I want for my channel

5199.139 --> 5203.86
Globus added touch-up class that is

5202.36 --> 5207.88
hysterical

5203.86 --> 5209.4
that is absolutely hysterical

5207.88 --> 5211.96
thank you

5209.4 --> 5214.9
but they could

5211.96 --> 5217.4800000000005
if they know how to behave

5214.9 --> 5219.5199999999995
they know what you should and shouldn't

5217.48 --> 5221.98
do

5219.52 --> 5223.659000000001
then yeah they can definitely add it

5221.98 --> 5227.138999999999
touch a class

5223.659 --> 5230.32
I mean it feels pretty classy if I have

5227.139 --> 5233.139
like very overt globers

5230.32 --> 5235.659
for a long time and very over flat

5233.139 --> 5238.179
earthers for a long time

5235.659 --> 5239.5
like have a discussion together about

5238.179 --> 5242.679
things

5239.5 --> 5245.98
that they can then agree upon and feel

5242.679 --> 5248.38
like yeah you're not that bad after all

5245.98 --> 5251.08
that's something that I like

5248.38 --> 5253.4800000000005
because I really think it's just a

5251.08 --> 5255.639
philosophical struggle

5253.48 --> 5257.739
and it's not going to be actually solved

5255.639 --> 5260.139
because actually solving the struggle

5257.739 --> 5263.5
doesn't solve the struggle

5260.139 --> 5265.36
the struggle is there just to be

5263.5 --> 5267.1
and there's going to be people that are

5265.36 --> 5269.339999999999
drawn to that and that are going to do

5267.1 --> 5269.34
that

5272.08 --> 5277.42
so better to just deal with it learn to

5275.44 --> 5280.419999999999
deal with it

5277.42 --> 5280.42
foreign

5283.62 --> 5289.659
that's your cue to get the [ __ ] out

5286.719 --> 5292.2390000000005
[ __ ] [ __ ]

5289.659 --> 5297.239
that's one of those Rich piece of [ __ ]

5292.239 --> 5297.239
brat ass wipes that I mentioned before

5297.88 --> 5303.639
see the difference

5300.28 --> 5307.179
I mean this guy is not a glober

5303.639 --> 5308.4400000000005
this guy is an [ __ ]

5307.179 --> 5311.62
yeah

5308.44 --> 5314.678999999999
or a knuckle Womble is a Glover

5311.62 --> 5317.44
a kumu virus is a Glover

5314.679 --> 5319.719
I think even Aries 106 is a glober I'm

5317.44 --> 5320.62
not sure I keep forgetting but he might

5319.719 --> 5323.7390000000005
be

5320.62 --> 5326.5599999999995
and they don't behave like that

5323.739 --> 5328.299999999999
they know better

5326.56 --> 5330.6990000000005
right

5328.3 --> 5332.860000000001
that's why I don't think that people

5330.699 --> 5335.44
like that are actually globers they're

5332.86 --> 5337.78
just [ __ ] and they're probably very

5335.44 --> 5339.699
miserable with their life

5337.78 --> 5343.239
because

5339.699 --> 5348.12
it sucks and those that they should be

5343.239 --> 5348.12
looking up to are miserable evil people

5348.4 --> 5353.08
and they don't know how to get out

5351.82 --> 5356.0199999999995
and they don't know how to build

5353.08 --> 5359.26
confidence and so they end up just

5356.02 --> 5360.76
[ __ ] on perceived or chosen

5359.26 --> 5362.62
opponents

5360.76 --> 5365.139
so they probably people that act like

5362.62 --> 5368.08
that don't really care about philosophy

5365.139 --> 5370.6
about globe or flatter at all they just

5368.08 --> 5372.94
care about division and about wrecking

5370.6 --> 5376.02
people

5372.94 --> 5376.0199999999995
that's the difference

5380.02 --> 5384.179
they don't behave more disco that's not

5381.94 --> 5384.178999999999
true

5385.3 --> 5391.139
the people that I just mentioned do they

5388.659 --> 5391.138999999999
do babe

5394.0 --> 5398.199
they're right here they're here right

5395.86 --> 5400.0
now they're behaving

5398.199 --> 5402.699
right now of course if you're gonna just

5400.0 --> 5405.58
start kicking at them calling them Globe

5402.699 --> 5409.78
Tarts to their face in my chat

5405.58 --> 5412.78
right yeah you should be expecting an

5409.78 --> 5415.48
equal type of limited response at least

5412.78 --> 5417.4
I mean it's not a rule like oh you can't

5415.48 --> 5419.919999999999
defend yourself

5417.4 --> 5421.659
but

5419.92 --> 5423.639
yeah these people are still around

5421.659 --> 5426.638999999999
because they know

5423.639 --> 5428.7390000000005
that you don't let yourself go out of

5426.639 --> 5430.4800000000005
control and then start disturbing the

5428.739 --> 5432.04
peace

5430.48 --> 5435.82
and that's why they're here and that's

5432.04 --> 5438.719
why orinocobo has it has a wrench

5435.82 --> 5438.719
for example

5441.5 --> 5445.96
[Music]

5443.92 --> 5447.9400000000005
that's right our knuckle Womble and I

5445.96 --> 5449.44
really appreciate that you have that

5447.94 --> 5452.98
insight

5449.44 --> 5455.5599999999995
and that you also live by it I really

5452.98 --> 5457.299999999999
appreciate that and that's why you have

5455.56 --> 5459.580000000001
a wrench

5457.3 --> 5462.159000000001
even though we've had our bump ins a

5459.58 --> 5464.739
couple of times where I guess it would

5462.159 --> 5466.36
would be pushing on the globe a little

5464.739 --> 5469.239
hard

5466.36 --> 5471.339999999999
and then you annoyed me and but you

5469.239 --> 5475.0
still have the wrench

5471.34 --> 5477.400000000001
because you had it under control

5475.0 --> 5479.679
enough

5477.4 --> 5482.379999999999
because you get it you get what I'm

5479.679 --> 5485.82
trying to achieve here with this chap

5482.38 --> 5485.82
and I really appreciate it

5486.28 --> 5489.9
I mean I call that a success

5490.54 --> 5496.239
I mean my chat is not filled with like a

5493.3 --> 5498.54
50 globers that have wrenches and 100

5496.239 --> 5501.638999999999
flat earthers that have wrenches but but

5498.54 --> 5503.92
I mean at least you could call it a

5501.639 --> 5506.92
start you could call it a decent start

5503.92 --> 5510.76
and that makes me happy it means that it

5506.92 --> 5516.12
wasn't just all meant to be doomed or

5510.76 --> 5516.12
something right so yeah keep it up

5519.4 --> 5524.799999999999
yeah nakumovirus is not getting rich

5521.82 --> 5527.139
[Music]

5524.8 --> 5529.78
just needs to be periodically kicked out

5527.139 --> 5531.219
when he just gets in one of his weird

5529.78 --> 5534.219
moods

5531.219 --> 5537.159
and gets too much on my nerves

5534.219 --> 5539.92
but I always allow him back because I do

5537.159 --> 5543.099999999999
know that he eventually always just

5539.92 --> 5545.38
refers back to a more reasonable way of

5543.1 --> 5547.3
going about

5545.38 --> 5549.400000000001
right

5547.3 --> 5550.84
eventually

5549.4 --> 5554.46
right anyway

5550.84 --> 5554.46
oh man time is flying

5566.86 --> 5570.54
are you guys all enjoying the show

5572.679 --> 5577.29
always joking yeah not really akumo

5575.139 --> 5588.4890000000005
virus

5577.29 --> 5588.489
[Music]

5593.92 --> 5599.26
and so you are not sure that oh okay

5596.62 --> 5601.5599999999995
Orinoco are really you're not sure about

5599.26 --> 5601.56
that

5601.84 --> 5609.639
do I need to show you my block list

5604.96 --> 5611.44
dude I got like 600 plus people

5609.639 --> 5615.88
all socks

5611.44 --> 5615.879999999999
like custom-made socks

5622.36 --> 5625.32
okay okay

5630.159 --> 5634.179
right

5631.48 --> 5638.04
no worries

5634.179 --> 5638.04
10 more minutes and then

5639.84 --> 5643.649
[Music]

5649.44 --> 5652.5
[Music]

5657.639 --> 5663.76
anyway I could uh do a little feedback

5661.239 --> 5667.62
to where I started

5663.76 --> 5667.62
psychological environmentalism

5668.32 --> 5672.94
a realization that maybe this is what I

5672.159 --> 5674.44
do

5672.94 --> 5676.419999999999
maybe I'm a psychological

5674.44 --> 5678.04
environmentalist that maybe I've always

5676.42 --> 5680.26
been that

5678.04 --> 5683.08
or I was an environmentalist and then

5680.26 --> 5687.639
realized that the environment is pretty

5683.08 --> 5689.92
doing well actually in my opinion

5687.639 --> 5693.219
it's the psychological environment

5689.92 --> 5695.679
that's really getting worse and worse

5693.219 --> 5698.5
so to meet that challenge

5695.679 --> 5702.06
I develop skills to basically clean up

5698.5 --> 5702.06
some psychological pollution

5702.639 --> 5709.84
which of course is going to be very

5705.659 --> 5712.179
ironic and maybe even crazy

5709.84 --> 5714.639
to well globers

5712.179 --> 5717.639
let's see no it's the Flat Earth early

5714.639 --> 5721.179
bird show what Flat Earth but that is

5717.639 --> 5724.4800000000005
psychological pollution of course yes

5721.179 --> 5728.02
this is crazy you're a Marxist because

5724.48 --> 5730.718999999999
your flat earther and you can't be a

5728.02 --> 5732.9400000000005
psychological environmentalist

5730.719 --> 5735.4
right well when I say psychological

5732.94 --> 5738.599999999999
environmentalist that doesn't mean we

5735.4 --> 5743.138999999999
have to erase the globe

5738.6 --> 5745.42
no no there's not going away you see

5743.139 --> 5749.62
but we can

5745.42 --> 5751.659
just try to clean up a bit more inside

5749.62 --> 5756.58
our heads

5751.659 --> 5759.159
through discipline awareness

5756.58 --> 5761.5199999999995
politeness

5759.159 --> 5763.12
national awareness

5761.52 --> 5766.120000000001
and

5763.12 --> 5768.04
also yeah keeping ahead of the curve of

5766.12 --> 5771.4
psychological tactics

5768.04 --> 5774.1
through exposure and study and that is

5771.4 --> 5777.04
risky because yeah

5774.1 --> 5779.139
you might not really be good at it

5777.04 --> 5781.32
well then find people that are good at

5779.139 --> 5781.32
it

5782.5 --> 5784.98
anyway

5785.26 --> 5789.54
it's yeah if you just came in or you

5787.719 --> 5792.4
came in halfway it's definitely worth

5789.54 --> 5796.679
re-watching this show from the start

5792.4 --> 5796.679
because I had a whole roll out about it

5801.699 --> 5805.178999999999
what are my plans to combat

5803.5 --> 5807.04
psychological dumb and good question

5805.179 --> 5810.82
Aries 106.

5807.04 --> 5814.239
uh well the only way to combat

5810.82 --> 5817.9
psychological dumbing is to basically

5814.239 --> 5819.879999999999
ensure that you do not expose yourself

5817.9 --> 5822.78
to dumb things

5819.88 --> 5826.78
and dumb things does not mean to

5822.78 --> 5829.9
positions or philosophies that you do

5826.78 --> 5833.199
not agree to it's about quality of the

5829.9 --> 5835.0599999999995
structure the explanation rectal

5833.199 --> 5837.759999999999
implications

5835.06 --> 5839.8
to test basically the

5837.76 --> 5842.1990000000005
which you could call the sovereignty of

5839.8 --> 5844.96
a piece of information that comes out of

5842.199 --> 5848.379999999999
somebody like how much value does that

5844.96 --> 5852.34
information have how how long how long

5848.38 --> 5856.62
will it retain its spiritual value

5852.34 --> 5858.58
right well if it has very little

5856.62 --> 5860.5599999999995
longevity

5858.58 --> 5861.88
in its value and it's like yeah if you

5860.56 --> 5863.139
hear that in a week it's going to be

5861.88 --> 5864.88
completely pointless and you'll

5863.139 --> 5865.719
immediately shut it up well then it's

5864.88 --> 5868.78
dumb

5865.719 --> 5871.4800000000005
and then you shouldn't be caught up in

5868.78 --> 5873.099999999999
watching that sort of thing now if

5871.48 --> 5875.259999999999
something is really interesting keeps

5873.1 --> 5877.42
you focused keeps you sharp helps you

5875.26 --> 5879.639
too big oversight well then it's not

5877.42 --> 5881.7390000000005
dumbing

5879.639 --> 5883.6
and then

5881.739 --> 5886.0
yeah

5883.6 --> 5887.9800000000005
it can help you it's stimulating it

5886.0 --> 5890.92
keeps you sharp so you have to pay

5887.98 --> 5893.0199999999995
attention so what is something doing to

5890.92 --> 5895.38
you right it's just like you're gonna

5893.02 --> 5898.780000000001
watch some series for whatever reason

5895.38 --> 5903.34
Netflix or wherever

5898.78 --> 5905.5
and you're just starting to notice that

5903.34 --> 5907.42
as you're watching it you're just

5905.5 --> 5909.4
starting to feel a certain way and it's

5907.42 --> 5911.76
like this is something wrong about this

5909.4 --> 5914.5
I feel sick or

5911.76 --> 5916.6
uncomfortable in a weird way that I

5914.5 --> 5918.1
can't point out well then that means

5916.6 --> 5921.6
there's something slipping through

5918.1 --> 5921.6
that's not doing you any good

5921.82 --> 5926.62
to identify what is causing that to

5924.82 --> 5929.199
analyze the thing that you're watching

5926.62 --> 5930.12
and then realize how is this influencing

5929.199 --> 5931.9
me

5930.12 --> 5933.04
analysis

5931.9 --> 5936.759999999999
right

5933.04 --> 5939.639
so in a way you could all bend it back

5936.76 --> 5942.280000000001
into what is your Socratic score

5939.639 --> 5946.0
remember that episode

5942.28 --> 5947.139
yeah the way the universal way for a

5946.0 --> 5949.6
person

5947.139 --> 5953.32
as an individual to combat psychological

5949.6 --> 5955.06
dumbing is to be disciplined in the

5953.32 --> 5957.639
Socratic method

5955.06 --> 5961.6
keep asking questions keep being more

5957.639 --> 5963.639
specific figure out what is what

5961.6 --> 5967.120000000001
and then

5963.639 --> 5968.7390000000005
use that information to gain Insight on

5967.12 --> 5971.92
what is it doing

5968.739 --> 5974.44
is this smart is this dumb is this good

5971.92 --> 5976.9
for is it stimulating in a good way or

5974.44 --> 5980.0199999999995
is it stimulating in a bad way

5976.9 --> 5982.839999999999
and for what type of people because

5980.02 --> 5986.7390000000005
different people different levels of

5982.84 --> 5989.8
influence based on how they are how they

5986.739 --> 5992.138999999999
will their energies how they have their

5989.8 --> 5993.28
talents to account for things right the

5992.139 --> 5996.159000000001
balance is different for different

5993.28 --> 5996.88
people fractal Insight you gotta realize

5996.159 --> 5999.58
it

5996.88 --> 6002.46
and every time I do a show I think about

5999.58 --> 6004.199
a thousand different people that are

6002.46 --> 6006.2390000000005
completely different in ever in all

6004.199 --> 6008.5199999999995
kinds of ways and how are they going to

6006.239 --> 6010.919999999999
respond to seeing this it might be like

6008.52 --> 6014.46
a very remote response but I'll still

6010.92 --> 6018.2390000000005
think about it that that happens

6014.46 --> 6021.179
right anyways I got a bit enthusiastic

6018.239 --> 6024.0
about the fractal thinking again

6021.179 --> 6025.7390000000005
but yeah I hope I gave you something to

6024.0 --> 6028.82
think about in response to your question

6025.739 --> 6028.82
which was a good question

6042.36 --> 6045.86
I hope you took it to heart

6051.42 --> 6056.52
Aries 106. you're the one that asked the

6054.84 --> 6058.7390000000005
question right yeah you did it was a

6056.52 --> 6061.860000000001
good question don't know why you gave me

6058.739 --> 6064.94
the overheated face

6061.86 --> 6064.94
Smiley but

6071.76 --> 6077.280000000001
what yeah cathartic to watch dumb stuff

6074.159 --> 6079.739
yeah well a good example would be GI Joe

6077.28 --> 6082.5
the series the cartoon series or even

6079.739 --> 6085.08
the old Transformers although that has a

6082.5 --> 6087.42
special thing but especially GI Joe it's

6085.08 --> 6089.5199999999995
like oh so this is cool but then you

6087.42 --> 6092.1
watch it and then you see how freaking

6089.52 --> 6093.659000000001
dumb it actually is and if you just keep

6092.1 --> 6097.38
watching it and there's YouTube channel

6093.659 --> 6099.299999999999
just stream it 24 7. for some reason if

6097.38 --> 6101.04
you keep watching it you're really gonna

6099.3 --> 6104.179
notice that after just a few episodes

6101.04 --> 6109.04
you're gonna be real

6104.179 --> 6109.04
like that literally happens to me

6109.92 --> 6115.32
and then I'm like [ __ ] this [ __ ] I gotta

6113.28 --> 6117.78
wake up I gotta go outside look around

6115.32 --> 6120.42
and get moving because like this is

6117.78 --> 6121.98
making me [ __ ] even though in my

6120.42 --> 6123.3
memory it's always like Yeah Yeah Joe

6121.98 --> 6124.919999999999
it's kind of cool there's something cool

6123.3 --> 6129.119000000001
about it but then you watch it and it's

6124.92 --> 6131.88
actually oh this is really dumbing right

6129.119 --> 6133.5
be aware be aware if you're watching

6131.88 --> 6137.159000000001
something even if you have a

6133.5 --> 6139.199
preconceived idea about it be honest how

6137.159 --> 6140.879999999999
is it influencing you as you're watching

6139.199 --> 6144.119
that doesn't mean that you have to been

6140.88 --> 6146.82
completely not watch it and enjoy it and

6144.119 --> 6150.32
just be analytical about it but always

6146.82 --> 6150.32
keep like an eye

6150.84 --> 6156.360000000001
in the background like always don't over

6154.26 --> 6158.46
analyze but always have a little

6156.36 --> 6161.04
awareness of like yeah stuff you're

6158.46 --> 6164.4
watching is influencing you keep track

6161.04 --> 6166.619
you don't have to over focus on it but

6164.4 --> 6168.299999999999
try to keep track is better for you

6166.619 --> 6170.699
