177.599 --> 180.159
discord

180.72 --> 185.76
and conversation about calendars and i

184.08 --> 187.59900000000002

just link it up here as well

210.84 --> 214.48

214.48 --> 219.35999999999999
know i don't want to risk getting

216.08 --> 222.64000000000001
something and it's true yeah

219.36 --> 224.799
24 7 discord they don't seem to mind

222.64 --> 226.48
but yeah their channel isn't monetized

224.799 --> 229.12
so it shouldn't i guess it doesn't

226.48 --> 230.79899999999998
matter there

229.12 --> 231.92000000000002
right anyway this is

230.799 --> 233.76000000000002
yeah

231.92 --> 235.76
a song

233.76 --> 238.39999999999998
that's been my

235.76 --> 241.12
favorite electronic song for a long time

238.4 --> 243.519
it's super psychological all of

241.12 --> 245.04
his songs are

243.519 --> 247.28
because

245.04 --> 250.239
yeah

247.28 --> 252.48
i really loved it though it

250.239 --> 255.72
and it still applies hey

252.48 --> 255.72
good servant

261.919 --> 265.52
oh

263.199 --> 265.52000000000004
okay

266.639 --> 273.12
okay well thank you good servant i

270.479 --> 275.919
i kind of forgot what that situation was

273.12 --> 275.919
about though but

276.88 --> 280.4
i mean i've been very pokey

280.56 --> 284.32
towards you and your crowd

286.4 --> 292.67999999999995
so but it's okay

288.479 --> 292.68
as long as you're just doing all right

303.84 --> 311.84
but yeah apology accepted i guess

308.16 --> 311.84000000000003
asked me huh

311.919 --> 315.52
hmm

312.96 --> 317.919
all right all right

315.52 --> 320.56
well yeah that's pretty cool of you to

317.919 --> 322.639
admit that right even if just for

320.56 --> 325.919
yourself because i've kind of already

322.639 --> 327.52
forgotten the situation but yeah

325.919 --> 329.28
you know when you do those kind of

327.52 --> 330.4
things you're the one that's usually

329.28 --> 332.32
gonna

330.4 --> 334.23999999999995
like be sitting with the issue because

332.32 --> 336.4
you know

334.24 --> 339.28000000000003
if you weren't completely honest even

336.4 --> 343.12
though others might not pick up on that

339.28 --> 345.35999999999996
or kind of forget about it so

343.12 --> 348.16
it's supposed to be kirsten within right

345.36 --> 350.08000000000004
yeah it is it is an important noble

348.16 --> 353.6
trait indeed

350.08 --> 355.59999999999997
but hey admitting a mistake

353.6 --> 357.44
is also important

355.6 --> 360.08000000000004
so it's all right good servant don't

357.44 --> 360.08
worry about it

362.3 --> 367.08
[Music]

363.52 --> 367.08
and welcome back

381.759 --> 385.84000000000003
right so yeah what have you been up to

386.88 --> 392.15999999999997
i haven't really seen you

388.72 --> 392.16
do live streams in a while

392.8 --> 396.8
thank you for the 99 cent super chat

398.56 --> 404.24
right anyway i'm stocked up on stuff

401.36 --> 406.89
today green tea

404.24 --> 408.40000000000003
got some grapefruit juice still

406.89 --> 410.7
[Music]

408.4 --> 413.44
more blueberries

410.7 --> 415.52
[Music]

413.44 --> 416.96
and even a gusto i had one yesterday i

415.52 --> 420.56
didn't drink it

416.96 --> 420.56
i don't know if i'm gonna i just got

420.84 --> 426.0
these and it might or might not take

424.24 --> 427.759
them during the stream

426.0 --> 430.24
if not i'll just have something for

427.759 --> 430.24
tomorrow

431.36 --> 438.56
you do two streams a day what okay

434.96 --> 438.56
damn that's a lot

447.039 --> 455.039
right but yeah i don't really come by

451.84 --> 456.31899999999996
a lot anymore good servant because

455.039 --> 458.8
it's just that

456.319 --> 461.44
your crowd is like

458.8 --> 463.039
very different from mine

461.44 --> 465.84
and you know

463.039 --> 470.0
that i have a tendency to like if i see

465.84 --> 471.67999999999995
a toe sticking out i'm gonna step on it

470.0 --> 473.84
you know

471.68 --> 475.68
on purpose

473.84 --> 476.87899999999996
because it's part of what i do it's like

475.68 --> 479.12
yeah you gotta

476.879 --> 481.84000000000003
you gotta my you gotta have some toe

479.12 --> 481.84000000000003
awareness

482.0 --> 487.28
right robin's and all that you gotta

484.96 --> 490.15999999999997
have some toe awareness

487.28 --> 492.0
so yeah if somebody's gonna be weird and

490.16 --> 494.639
aberrant in their behavior i'm just

492.0 --> 496.479
immediately gonna step right on there

494.639 --> 499.36
and i even tend to do this on other

496.479 --> 499.35999999999996
people's dreams

500.24 --> 503.68
right and then

501.44 --> 505.68
a lot of the times they're just like oh

503.68 --> 508.639
he's being offensive or something and

505.68 --> 508.639
then i get banned

508.879 --> 511.12
right

511.199 --> 515.6800000000001
but yeah

512.719 --> 515.6800000000001
i'm not doing it

515.839 --> 519.2790000000001
just to

516.959 --> 521.1199999999999
hurt people or something i'm doing it as

519.279 --> 523.68
a

521.12 --> 526.839
like it's a corrective behavior

523.68 --> 526.8389999999999
it's confrontational

527.6 --> 534.5600000000001
because i don't have patience

530.32 --> 537.0400000000001
if i see somebody's toes sticking out i

534.56 --> 538.3199999999999
don't want to hang around there

537.04 --> 542.0799999999999
right

538.32 --> 544.0
without anybody addressing it

542.08 --> 544.8000000000001
it just like

544.0 --> 546.32
yeah

544.8 --> 548.3199999999999
how can you have a conversation when

546.32 --> 551.839
somebody's toes just sticking out like

548.32 --> 555.6
that all the time super distracting

551.839 --> 555.6
anyways metaphorical by the way

561.6 --> 566.5600000000001
but yeah i am glad that yours yours your

564.64 --> 567.519
streams are kind of finding a momentum

566.56 --> 570.0799999999999
you're

567.519 --> 574.5600000000001
you're a place of your own now

570.08 --> 574.5600000000001
and you got a crowd and you got subjects

575.279 --> 579.6
and hopefully you get some support too

580.08 --> 583.32
good servant

600.72 --> 607.48
you just want to help

603.279 --> 607.48
don't get paid okay fine

628.079 --> 632.279
right as long as you get by

633.279 --> 638.399
you guys deserve it all right

635.92 --> 640.4799999999999
well that's very selfless of you just

638.399 --> 642.8
realize that

640.48 --> 645.279
i consider people that

642.8 --> 648.0
just have

645.279 --> 650.16
like a good directive for themselves and

648.0 --> 651.92
they want to help people

650.16 --> 655.04
they kind of need to be reminded to

651.92 --> 656.88
stick up for themselves as well right

655.04 --> 659.519
because

656.88 --> 662.48
the selflessness can kind of get be

659.519 --> 664.64
self-destructive as well

662.48 --> 666.16
right

664.64 --> 668.3199999999999
it's like

666.16 --> 671.76
because it's metaphorically like a

668.32 --> 674.88
soldier that's like no i'll offer myself

671.76 --> 676.079
for you guys i'll take the i'll take the

674.88 --> 678.399
punishment

676.079 --> 681.1999999999999
but then it's like yeah but you're like

678.399 --> 682.64
really a valued person and we kind of

681.2 --> 685.76
want you to

682.64 --> 687.92
get the proper armor and weapons

685.76 --> 690.64
and if you're like but no i don't like

687.92 --> 691.4399999999999
oh no you need it more than i do i'll

690.64 --> 693.4399999999999
right

691.44 --> 696.399
at some point

693.44 --> 699.12
it's going to be self-destructive

696.399 --> 702.079
that's why i'm not embarrassed

699.12 --> 704.9590000000001
to basically ask for funding

702.079 --> 708.959
and what i do because i know that i have

704.959 --> 708.959
skill that requires

709.519 --> 714.16
yeah

711.04 --> 717.16
it requires some support to keep it out

714.16 --> 717.16
there

719.12 --> 723.12
right but if you're in a financial good

721.36 --> 726.72
balance in your life then yeah i guess

723.12 --> 726.72
you don't necessarily need it

728.079 --> 733.959
hey matthew hall clutch good to see you

747.76 --> 750.079
hmm

753.839 --> 757.8800000000001
hello t-bone jones

769.279 --> 772.56
right

770.88 --> 775.279
so yeah

772.56 --> 778.2399999999999
pretty much up for whatever anybody

775.279 --> 778.24
wants to talk about

779.68 --> 782.8
except maybe for that

783.279 --> 787.04
no

784.16 --> 790.3199999999999
no nobody saw that

787.04 --> 790.3199999999999
probably riley did

796.0 --> 800.72
i haven't heard him mention anything

798.32 --> 804.0400000000001
about it

800.72 --> 804.0400000000001
so far

815.2 --> 820.839
do i agree

817.12 --> 820.839
agree with what

826.25 --> 829.33

one of the guys that's also part of the

842.88 --> 845.8389999999999
flat earth debate team

850.16 --> 853.6
because ranty and riley used to be

852.48 --> 857.5600000000001
friends

853.6 --> 857.5600000000001
before ranty basically

858.079 --> 864.68
switched

860.32 --> 864.6800000000001
to become an anti-flat earther

876.24 --> 880.16
i have no idea what you're talking about

878.399 --> 882.16

[Music]

1032.72 --> 1039.16
right anyway

1035.12 --> 1039.1599999999999
what was i doing yesterday

1057.28 --> 1061.6
right

1059.36 --> 1061.6
just

1062.08 --> 1068.799
made by jimbo stream was amazing again

1065.039 --> 1068.799
like i really love his streams

1073.2 --> 1077.44
martin had a weird kind of panel show

1075.76 --> 1078.64
with

1077.44 --> 1081.1200000000001
uh

1078.64 --> 1085.2800000000002
with roxanne

1081.12 --> 1085.28
and like yeah her compadre

1085.52 --> 1091.679
that was i guess something i i didn't

1088.24 --> 1092.96
really follow most of it

1091.679 --> 1095.039
was kind of

1092.96 --> 1097.3600000000001
general talk

1095.039 --> 1097.36
uh

1098.96 --> 1102.08
what else

1100.08 --> 1104.48
right yeah i did watch my show back

1102.08 --> 1106.3999999999999
yesterday i watched my show yesterday

1104.48 --> 1109.84
back entirely

1106.4 --> 1109.8400000000001
that was really good

1110.64 --> 1114.1200000000001
i loved it

1122.559 --> 1128.799
even like the part with

1124.72 --> 1128.799
with john hawkins was just hysterical

1130.559 --> 1134.0
so yeah i ended up naming the show

1132.24 --> 1136.4
yesterday how to deal with a fiery

1134.0 --> 1137.679
spirit since that applied to pretty much

1136.4 --> 1139.76
every part

1137.679 --> 1141.919
first me as a fiery spirit and then

1139.76 --> 1144.96
afterwards sean

1141.919 --> 1148.3200000000002
basically being an out of control flame

1144.96 --> 1148.32
just burning wildly

1149.76 --> 1154.96
hey jeff gas head

1152.6 --> 1156.1599999999999
drunkenbullet411 hey it's been a while

1154.96 --> 1159.88
good to see you

1156.16 --> 1159.88
how are you doing man

1166.0 --> 1171.12
yeah quantum of conscience yeah

1169.36 --> 1174.12
now he is pretty

1171.12 --> 1174.12
interesting

1180.32 --> 1184.6399999999999
oh oh that's interesting that you say

1182.16 --> 1186.24
that terror 306 you can't even begin to

1184.64 --> 1187.919
imagine what goes in a ball tart

1186.24 --> 1190.4
malfunctioning brain

1187.919 --> 1192.7990000000002
well why don't you listen to the link

1190.4 --> 1194.799
that i posted

1192.799 --> 1196.799
at the start of this show you might

1194.799 --> 1198.799
still be able to scroll up and watch it

1196.799 --> 1200.8799999999999
it's a song

1198.799 --> 1202.24
it's called between worlds from mind in

1200.88 --> 1204.24
a box

1202.24 --> 1205.52
if you listen very carefully to the text

1204.24 --> 1207.6
you might be able to look it up

1205.52 --> 1208.84
somewhere

1207.6 --> 1211.84
that's

1208.84 --> 1213.6789999999999
exactly what goes on

1211.84 --> 1216.0
in their mind

1213.679 --> 1218.96
yeah and that's a song that i was

1216.0 --> 1218.96
listening to like

1219.44 --> 1222.48
12 years ago

1224.72 --> 1229.6000000000001
and also it's a really awesome electro

1227.039 --> 1232.0
song really awesome

1229.6 --> 1235.6
it's one of my favorite songs pretty

1232.0 --> 1239.84
much electro

1235.6 --> 1239.84
of all time also because of the text

1243.52 --> 1248.559
it to me

1245.12 --> 1251.9189999999999
at the time when i was listening it

1248.559 --> 1254.32
it the song was about me

1251.919 --> 1256.159
while i was still in the transition and

1254.32 --> 1258.24
i was literally trying to hang in

1256.159 --> 1260.5590000000002
between worlds

1258.24 --> 1263.44
so to me at the time listening to that

1260.559 --> 1266.0
was like magic it's like an outsider

1263.44 --> 1268.4
explaining to me exactly

1266.0 --> 1271.44
where my mind is at including the

1268.4 --> 1274.0800000000002
suspense of disbelief effects while i'm

1271.44 --> 1277.48
still in it and remain in it

1274.08 --> 1277.48
that's magical

1282.88 --> 1285.88
anyway

1290.799 --> 1296.72
your shout out for illuminati croissant

1294.4 --> 1298.799
thanks drunken bullet

1296.72 --> 1300.559
yeah i i actually take regular

1298.799 --> 1302.72
croissants these days

1300.559 --> 1304.24
illuminati croissants for some reason

1302.72 --> 1307.039
they

1304.24 --> 1309.2
kind of fall a bit hard on the stomach

1307.039 --> 1311.76
for some reason every time i've taken

1309.2 --> 1314.0800000000002
them in in the recent times

1311.76 --> 1316.72
regular croissants are better

1314.08 --> 1319.72
paypal your dude oh

1316.72 --> 1319.72
okay

1332.4 --> 1335.44
oh

1334.0 --> 1337.2
thank you man

1335.44 --> 1339.76
thank you for the paypal that's really

1337.2 --> 1339.76
appreciated

1340.32 --> 1346.84
i can definitely get like a whole bunch

1342.72 --> 1346.84
of croissants from that

1353.919 --> 1357.24
thanks man

1365.59 --> 1368.859
[Music]

1372.96 --> 1378.88
ah now it's such beautiful weather

1376.88 --> 1384.0800000000002
even if they do just

1378.88 --> 1384.0800000000002
send these freaking spray planes there

1384.32 --> 1389.4399999999998
see that

1386.4 --> 1391.039
i mean

1389.44 --> 1394.3200000000002
that's a pretty

1391.039 --> 1394.32
hefty trail there

1398.88 --> 1403.44
although yeah when you look at the back

1400.96 --> 1405.6000000000001
end of it it does kind of seem to

1403.44 --> 1407.919
evaporate but there's also just kind of

1405.6 --> 1410.6399999999999
like the

1407.919 --> 1411.76
first traces of a gray soup forming up

1410.64 --> 1415.96
there

1411.76 --> 1415.96
in between all that bright blue

1420.96 --> 1424.64
in a way if i had some kind of mobile

1423.52 --> 1427.279
setup

1424.64 --> 1430.64
i'd absolutely go outside and do my show

1427.279 --> 1433.2
because it's just amazing weather

1430.64 --> 1433.2
oh well

1437.76 --> 1440.559
hey crockett

1443.76 --> 1447.36
hey tony whitcomb good to see you

1447.44 --> 1451.039
they spray again it's relentless

1451.679 --> 1456.0
it's a program it's just

1454.159 --> 1458.24
it's what it is

1456.0 --> 1460.799
and i doubt that the people actually

1458.24 --> 1462.88
performing it consciously know what what

1460.799 --> 1465.8799999999999
they're doing they're just doing the

1462.88 --> 1465.88
program

1474.48 --> 1479.52
i mean i still don't know with any

1476.559 --> 1482.0
certainty like what's in that

1479.52 --> 1484.8799999999999
in order to actually

1482.0 --> 1487.76
get a reading by the way

1484.88 --> 1491.7600000000002
i think that the only real good way

1487.76 --> 1493.76
would be to go up there with a plane

1491.76 --> 1496.96
and kind of like

1493.76 --> 1498.799
catch the trails right

1496.96 --> 1501.679
like in a filter

1498.799 --> 1503.279
like scoop up trails as as they're still

1501.679 --> 1505.52
kind of cohesive

1503.279 --> 1507.44
and not dissolved yet

1505.52 --> 1510.48
scoop them up

1507.44 --> 1512.559
and then do a spectral analysis on that

1510.48 --> 1514.64
right

1512.559 --> 1516.3999999999999
now if you do that

1514.64 --> 1519.1200000000001
that's the second

1516.4 --> 1520.48
or the moment where you actually know

1519.12 --> 1522.3999999999999
exactly

1520.48 --> 1526.32
what it is they're spraying right it

1522.4 --> 1528.96
could be just kind of silicon dust

1526.32 --> 1532.1589999999999
for all we know

1528.96 --> 1534.159
because yeah spraying poisonous

1532.159 --> 1537.1200000000001
chemicals and all that

1534.159 --> 1539.3600000000001
tends to be very hazardous

1537.12 --> 1540.3999999999999
and they've been doing it

1539.36 --> 1543.52
for

1540.4 --> 1546.88
what is it 27 years now

1543.52 --> 1548.799
so and pretty persistently though like

1546.88 --> 1551.5200000000002
logically if the it's always been

1548.799 --> 1553.52
chemicals then

1551.52 --> 1557.039
let's just say things would not be as

1553.52 --> 1559.52
nice and green out there and blossomy

1557.039 --> 1562.0
like everything would kind of start to

1559.52 --> 1563.6
just die under the punishment of that

1562.0 --> 1564.88
after a while

1563.6 --> 1567.279
right

1564.88 --> 1571.679
so i've been suspecting that they aren't

1567.279 --> 1573.36
actually chemtrails but just trails

1571.679 --> 1574.96
geoengineering

1573.36 --> 1578.32
for sure

1574.96 --> 1582.8400000000001
it probably has an influence on it

1578.32 --> 1584.6399999999999
maybe even like weird pharmaceutical

1582.84 --> 1587.039
[ __ ]

1584.64 --> 1588.3200000000002
because of like government

1587.039 --> 1590.96
operations

1588.32 --> 1592.32
maybe that too but not just general

1590.96 --> 1595.52
poisoning

1592.32 --> 1595.52
that makes no sense

1597.039 --> 1604.08
you've seen the tanks inside the plane

1600.32 --> 1607.039
the plane or a plane i mean i've seen

1604.08 --> 1609.36
planes that were specifically

1607.039 --> 1610.8799999999999
designed to spray like without

1609.36 --> 1612.8799999999999
passengers and all the tanks in there

1610.88 --> 1615.919
yeah i've seen that that's like even

1612.88 --> 1617.2
from the early 2000s

1615.919 --> 1620.96
but

1617.2 --> 1623.3600000000001
are those is it ex these planes that do

1620.96 --> 1625.039
that are they are they actually those

1623.36 --> 1628.24
planes you see

1625.039 --> 1630.799
do you know for certain

1628.24 --> 1630.799
i don't

1634.08 --> 1638.039
hey seeking star wars

1640.24 --> 1642.32
right

1641.12 --> 1643.279
and i know

1642.32 --> 1644.6399999999999
that

1643.279 --> 1646.88
in america

1644.64 --> 1650.88
in certain period of time

1646.88 --> 1653.3600000000001
they did actually like spray aluminium

1650.88 --> 1656.159
and barium salts

1653.36 --> 1658.399
and some weird fungi [ __ ]

1656.159 --> 1660.64
and they did actually take ground

1658.399 --> 1663.6
samples so

1660.64 --> 1665.039
but that seems to be kind of a isolated

1663.6 --> 1666.799
incident

1665.039 --> 1668.96
it did it

1666.799 --> 1670.72
as a test perhaps

1668.96 --> 1672.24
it's not universal

1670.72 --> 1674.1200000000001
and that's where it all kind of got

1672.24 --> 1677.039
mixed in and hyped up and it was like oh

1674.12 --> 1677.9189999999999
everything is that is chemtrail is now

1677.039 --> 1680.24
that

1677.919 --> 1682.0
that's kind of the early

1680.24 --> 1684.64
conspiracy

1682.0 --> 1687.279
9 11 era

1684.64 --> 1689.919
opinion about it

1687.279 --> 1693.44
right but i think that's incorrect it

1689.919 --> 1696.48
makes no sense if it is like that

1693.44 --> 1699.76
except maybe in like california

1696.48 --> 1701.2
because they really seem to just spray

1699.76 --> 1704.24
like

1701.2 --> 1706.24
perhaps actual chemicals

1704.24 --> 1709.24
so i've heard but it's very region

1706.24 --> 1709.24
specific

1717.12 --> 1721.4399999999998
saint louis spring tenants

1722.08 --> 1725.12
hmm

1723.039 --> 1729.279
i vaguely recollect something about it

1725.12 --> 1729.279
was that like in the 50s or 60s

1732.24 --> 1735.76
yeah

1733.36 --> 1739.1999999999998
but yes there have been experiments like

1735.76 --> 1742.0
that including like mind control related

1739.2 --> 1744.88
and [ __ ] there's all kinds of weird

1742.0 --> 1747.12
little experiments that have been done

1744.88 --> 1749.3600000000001
that doesn't mean it's all

1747.12 --> 1749.36
what

1749.52 --> 1753.799
morris john what the hell

1755.279 --> 1757.6
what

1758.399 --> 1762.399
what's boris johnson have to do with

1760.159 --> 1762.3990000000001
that

1765.039 --> 1769.52
really boris johnson was like a

1769.679 --> 1773.0
spray plane

1770.98 --> 1774.88
[Music]

1773.0 --> 1776.559
experiment

1774.88 --> 1778.64
pilot

1776.559 --> 1780.559
the [ __ ]

1778.64 --> 1782.88
really

1780.559 --> 1782.8799999999999
god

1786.0 --> 1791.32
this guy just gets worse and worse

1788.0 --> 1791.32
doesn't he

1817.039 --> 1823.559
weird

1818.32 --> 1823.559
explains the hair this is

1850.32 --> 1855.279
seen youtube videos

1852.399 --> 1860.039
where they make the dust

1855.279 --> 1860.039
the yeah but what is the dust then

1888.03 --> 1891.109
[Music]

1908.88 --> 1912.64
okay

1911.2 --> 1913.44
right

1912.64 --> 1918.6000000000001
but

1913.44 --> 1918.6000000000001
from what time again tony whitcomb

1933.679 --> 1939.6000000000001
allegedly yeah but allegedly doesn't

1936.0 --> 1939.6
help anything at all

1939.84 --> 1945.039
because allegedly we'd already be dead

1942.559 --> 1949.2
if like everything

1945.039 --> 1951.44
that's like been potentially

1949.2 --> 1953.3600000000001
possible that they are doing if that was

1951.44 --> 1955.679
all true already all but everything

1953.36 --> 1958.7199999999998
would be dead there wouldn't be a single

1955.679 --> 1958.72
plant alive

1960.84 --> 1967.9189999999999
so i'm very skeptical

1965.519 --> 1970.0
i mean i'm almost thinking at this point

1967.919 --> 1972.88
that just the mere suggestion that

1970.0 --> 1975.84
they're spraying poison

1972.88 --> 1976.88
is almost like on purpose just to make

1975.84 --> 1979.279
us

1976.88 --> 1981.0390000000002
numb with fear like

1979.279 --> 1983.039
our government is so evil and

1981.039 --> 1984.559
overpowering they're just poisoning us

1983.039 --> 1987.36
and there's nothing we can do about it

1984.559 --> 1990.08
they won't even admit it right

1987.36 --> 1992.7199999999998
that seems kind of like a mind control

1990.08 --> 1995.76
scheme to trap you in

1992.72 --> 1999.44
because why would they actually do that

1995.76 --> 2000.96
like why would you just spray

1999.44 --> 2002.24
highly toxic

2000.96 --> 2004.88
substances

2002.24 --> 2007.76
over prolonged periods when it literally

2004.88 --> 2007.7600000000002
kills everything

2010.799 --> 2015.44
scoop it up to be sure right

2012.96 --> 2017.76
just like you could use like a personal

2015.44 --> 2019.919
airplane perhaps

2017.76 --> 2022.559
or well it would have to be able to go

2019.919 --> 2024.48
up high enough and then just like

2022.559 --> 2025.279
with the net filter

2024.48 --> 2027.3600000000001
just

2025.279 --> 2029.519
fly right into the trail when it hasn't

2027.36 --> 2030.6399999999999
evaporated yet when it hasn't like

2029.519 --> 2035.96
sprayed

2030.64 --> 2035.96
waved out and you can take a sample

2043.55 --> 2046.71
[Music]

2046.72 --> 2050.32
how do you know it's toxic

2050.8 --> 2055.8390000000004
well

2052.639 --> 2058.839
barium salts and aluminum

2055.839 --> 2062.56
aluminium are

2058.839 --> 2064.399
toxic as fine dust that's toxic it's not

2062.56 --> 2066.56
good for anything it's going to be a

2064.399 --> 2068.96
burden especially on the soil if that's

2066.56 --> 2070.879
just sprayed it's going to literally

2068.96 --> 2074.56
destroy

2070.879 --> 2076.3199999999997
like the the micro biological life

2074.56 --> 2078.879
that takes place

2076.32 --> 2081.3590000000004
in the soil that allows plants to

2078.879 --> 2081.359
flourish

2082.079 --> 2087.48
that's what it would do if it was

2083.919 --> 2087.48
exactly that

2094.96 --> 2099.119
said in delhi is the most yeah but tara

2097.2 --> 2101.04
that's because of not of what is sprayed

2099.119 --> 2104.079
in the sky is what is coming out of

2101.04 --> 2104.079
factories and [ __ ]

2105.52 --> 2111.7599999999998
it's just because the environmental

2107.599 --> 2114.0
regulations like it's so corrupted

2111.76 --> 2115.92
in india that they just like not just

2114.0 --> 2118.88
dump it in a river and just give him

2115.92 --> 2120.56
bribe and everything is alright

2118.88 --> 2122.32
that's the kind of [ __ ] that happens

2120.56 --> 2126.2
there

2122.32 --> 2126.2000000000003
and it's made it terrible

2140.4 --> 2148.359
i mean what would chemtrails do more

2142.96 --> 2148.359
here i i don't understand

2163.119 --> 2167.28
well yeah tony yeah but that's

2166.0 --> 2169.359
right

2167.28 --> 2170.96
that's just weather modification

2169.359 --> 2174.48
blocking the sun

2170.96 --> 2175.599
temporarily or like creating

2174.48 --> 2176.56
dust

2175.599 --> 2179.2000000000003
for

2176.56 --> 2182.56
water vapor to latch onto right to

2179.2 --> 2183.5989999999997
create rain etc that's just

2182.56 --> 2185.68
it's like

2183.599 --> 2186.96
weather engineering

2185.68 --> 2190.8799999999997
right that

2186.96 --> 2190.88
it doesn't have to be poisonous

2192.8 --> 2198.2400000000002
right that the whole poison thing

2196.32 --> 2200.48
is like a separate branch of thinking

2198.24 --> 2201.68
and surely they have done that in the

2200.48 --> 2205.04
past

2201.68 --> 2207.52
probably as a testing phase

2205.04 --> 2209.359
but that doesn't mean that that is the

2207.52 --> 2212.16
standard now

2209.359 --> 2214.4
because it's poisonous why would you

2212.16 --> 2216.16
just like just

2214.4 --> 2218.079
kill everything

2216.16 --> 2221.2799999999997
just like that don't even tell anyone

2218.079 --> 2223.04
just let it all slowly die and nobody

2221.28 --> 2225.0400000000004
even knows it's happening

2223.04 --> 2227.599
like why

2225.04 --> 2230.16
why would anybody

2227.599 --> 2230.1600000000003
do that

2230.48 --> 2236.56
and like wouldn't we notice

2234.079 --> 2238.48
wouldn't that be noticed like everywhere

2236.56 --> 2241.359
is like oh yeah

2238.48 --> 2242.96
oh man like every crop is just starting

2241.359 --> 2246.0
to fail now

2242.96 --> 2248.56
oh plants aren't even blossoming anymore

2246.0 --> 2250.88
like now half my trees are dying in the

2248.56 --> 2253.7599999999998
winter like yeah

2250.88 --> 2254.839
people would notice that [ __ ]

2253.76 --> 2258.0
big

2254.839 --> 2259.359
time okay

2258.0 --> 2263.119
and they're not

2259.359 --> 2263.119
it's not happening like that

2265.04 --> 2269.44
except maybe for very specific regions

2267.44 --> 2272.48
like in california where there is

2269.44 --> 2274.96
reports it's just really extreme

2272.48 --> 2278.0
spraying and that it even like smells

2274.96 --> 2280.56
and [ __ ] right which is a sure sign of

2278.0 --> 2280.56
chemicals

2280.96 --> 2287.359
and things are like

2283.599 --> 2287.3590000000004
it's pretty [ __ ] up there so yeah

2288.0 --> 2292.48
i have a suspicion there is actual

2290.079 --> 2294.6400000000003
chemical spraying in california where

2292.48 --> 2297.64
they're literally just trying to destroy

2294.64 --> 2297.64
it

2299.839 --> 2304.96
destroy the potential

2302.0 --> 2308.079
of the of the ground there

2304.96 --> 2310.32
and drive the people nuts

2308.079 --> 2311.44
make them unhealthier

2310.32 --> 2313.52
but

2311.44 --> 2317.56
that doesn't mean that it happens

2313.52 --> 2317.56
everywhere in the world

2362.88 --> 2365.2000000000003
right

2365.28 --> 2370.8
yeah look

2367.04 --> 2370.8
from the grave the whole thing about

2371.839 --> 2375.44
what

2373.359 --> 2377.68
about india and the pooping on the

2375.44 --> 2379.28
street and all that and i sometimes joke

2377.68 --> 2381.359
with it a bit

2379.28 --> 2383.92
but i'm pretty sure that doesn't like

2381.359 --> 2386.24
happen on main traffic roads that's more

2383.92 --> 2388.56
like just like the slums and there's a

2386.24 --> 2390.56
lot of them right that's where people

2388.56 --> 2393.68
shoot in streets

2390.56 --> 2397.839
not really like where the real

2393.68 --> 2397.839
industrial and the traffic areas are

2398.079 --> 2401.3590000000004
i mean if you do that police would

2400.16 --> 2402.56
probably just

2401.359 --> 2405.52
like

2402.56 --> 2405.52
yeah arrest you

2409.599 --> 2413.2000000000003
i think

2410.88 --> 2416.839
right territ

2413.2 --> 2416.839
am i anywhere close

2443.76 --> 2449.5600000000004
right

2445.92 --> 2449.56
that's what i thought

2459.119 --> 2461.359
uh

2462.319 --> 2468.16
yeah yeah tony it's terrible

2465.76 --> 2468.1600000000003
terrible

2472.319 --> 2477.119
i mean if they get any worse it's like

2474.8 --> 2481.48
the entire redwood forest that's still

2477.119 --> 2481.48
there is probably going to be destroyed

2483.44 --> 2487.359
like including the whole bohemian grove

2485.599 --> 2489.04
it's going to be like a

2487.359 --> 2491.2799999999997
wet desert

2489.04 --> 2494.319
eventually if they just keep this going

2491.28 --> 2496.5600000000004
they're literally destroying the land

2494.319 --> 2498.72
people that are organizing that should

2496.56 --> 2498.72
be

2499.359 --> 2502.64
just

2500.88 --> 2506.48
identified

2502.64 --> 2508.48
and then secretly disappear and

2506.48 --> 2513.0
gonna leave it to your imagination what

2508.48 --> 2513.0
should happen with them after that point

2529.2 --> 2535.52
right but california is rife with severe

2533.04 --> 2536.56
satanism like there's people there that

2535.52 --> 2539.2
are

2536.56 --> 2542.48
fully demonically possessed to a degree

2539.2 --> 2545.68
that we can't even like we don't want to

2542.48 --> 2547.44
know how bad that is we you really don't

2545.68 --> 2549.52
oh you think you're special or you think

2547.44 --> 2552.8
oh you've seen it no

2549.52 --> 2554.16
it's it's you don't want to know how bad

2552.8 --> 2557.2000000000003
that gets

2554.16 --> 2559.7599999999998
you really don't trust me on this

2557.2 --> 2562.72
right and they will probably just like

2559.76 --> 2565.6800000000003
yay we're going to absolutely destroy

2562.72 --> 2567.68
the land and everything on it forever

2565.68 --> 2569.7599999999998
make it a completely

2567.68 --> 2572.319
just a giant

2569.76 --> 2574.88
trash can wasteland and they'll be proud

2572.319 --> 2577.2799999999997
of it that's how [ __ ] up like some of

2574.88 --> 2578.6400000000003
those [ __ ] up satanist people could

2577.28 --> 2580.1600000000003
get

2578.64 --> 2584.64
and you don't know them those are not

2580.16 --> 2586.7999999999997
like the sjw makeup like oh i'm a devil

2584.64 --> 2586.7999999999997
no

2589.28 --> 2593.119
but they do all the actions that

2591.119 --> 2595.52
actually lead to the destruction of

2593.119 --> 2595.52
everything

2597.52 --> 2603.28
yeah that would be good if

2600.16 --> 2606.0
maybe a certain category of americans

2603.28 --> 2608.7200000000003
you know them as christians

2606.0 --> 2610.319
would actually just really do something

2608.72 --> 2612.9599999999996
about it

2610.319 --> 2615.2
as in like hey

2612.96 --> 2619.2
maybe the time to play the nice guy is a

2615.2 --> 2620.3999999999996
bit over now maybe you should actually

2619.2 --> 2623.7599999999998
get back to

2620.4 --> 2625.76
like what it's supposed to be

2623.76 --> 2628.7200000000003
an actual war

2625.76 --> 2630.4
against satan and not just oh being the

2628.72 --> 2632.7999999999997
nice one and just

2630.4 --> 2634.96
try to kill everybody's make them submit

2632.8 --> 2636.4
with kindness right that's a really cute

2634.96 --> 2640.079
strategy

2636.4 --> 2643.92
unfortunately at some point though

2640.079 --> 2646.96
devils are just going to ignore you

2643.92 --> 2649.28
and then you won't have an influence

2646.96 --> 2650.2400000000002
and you will literally see them carve

2649.28 --> 2652.4
out

2650.24 --> 2655.2799999999997
the land and destroy it right in front

2652.4 --> 2657.359
of you and do horrible things upon it

2655.28 --> 2660.48
and then you're going to be oh but if

2657.359 --> 2662.16
you just be nice they'll change no no

2660.48 --> 2668.119
they won't and that's why you have to

2662.16 --> 2668.1189999999997
transition to just inquisition war

2673.05 --> 2676.1690000000003
[Music]

2683.92 --> 2687.48
cow full of

2705.04 --> 2708.72
yeah borders boy that all depends on

2707.04 --> 2711.359
where you're getting it from right all

2708.72 --> 2712.72
that [ __ ] might be sort of legal in the

2711.359 --> 2717.52
united states

2712.72 --> 2719.839
thanks to your utterly utterly corrupted

2717.52 --> 2719.839
fda

2720.16 --> 2725.68
which is a mockery of what it's supposed

2722.64 --> 2727.2799999999997
to be it's a satanic organization per

2725.68 --> 2729.52
default

2727.28 --> 2730.8390000000004
based on what they've all done

2729.52 --> 2734.319
right per

2730.839 --> 2736.7999999999997
default in europe however it it's not

2734.319 --> 2739.2
like that

2736.8 --> 2739.2000000000003
at all

2742.72 --> 2749.1189999999997
i mean the the standard that is like

2745.52 --> 2750.64
legal here for food right the standard

2749.119 --> 2753.04
is pretty much

2750.64 --> 2756.4
what would be considered organic

2753.04 --> 2759.2799999999997
standard in the united states

2756.4 --> 2762.48
right because what you

2759.28 --> 2765.599
what like fda allows people to sell as

2762.48 --> 2768.56
food sometimes all the chemical garbage

2765.599 --> 2771.76
and all that like that's not even legal

2768.56 --> 2775.839
in europe at all that's like no

2771.76 --> 2775.8390000000004
you're not allowed to sell that

2790.96 --> 2795.599
all right so it's up to you you can

2792.96 --> 2799.44
either be like oh i'm just going to be

2795.599 --> 2802.7200000000003
a good boy under satan's cloak

2799.44 --> 2805.44
and i'll just not be mean

2802.72 --> 2808.319
while satan's literally ravaging and

2805.44 --> 2809.28
unraveling everything right around you

2808.319 --> 2811.68
or

2809.28 --> 2813.0400000000004
you could perhaps

2811.68 --> 2816.7999999999997
tell them

2813.04 --> 2819.839
and say hey we're done with being your

2816.8 --> 2821.76
[ __ ] slaves

2819.839 --> 2825.04
gonna appeal

2821.76 --> 2829.44
to the original divine rights

2825.04 --> 2831.52
and duty inscribed on our souls through

2829.44 --> 2833.359
the constitution

2831.52 --> 2837.68
of the founders

2833.359 --> 2840.0
and actually do something

2837.68 --> 2845.5589999999997
instead of just being good mind

2840.0 --> 2845.559
controlled slaves to satan all the time

2846.88 --> 2851.92
or not and then you all get slowly

2849.52 --> 2853.7599999999998
eradicated more and more over time and

2851.92 --> 2855.44
america will be even worse and worse and

2853.76 --> 2857.44
then at some point

2855.44 --> 2860.0
outsiders will be like

2857.44 --> 2861.599
yeah maybe we should just fire bomb the

2860.0 --> 2862.64
entire place

2861.599 --> 2864.4
i mean

2862.64 --> 2866.0789999999997
their lands already destroyed they

2864.4 --> 2868.7200000000003
already poison everything to death

2866.079 --> 2870.8
there's nothing left

2868.72 --> 2872.8799999999997
to protect there's no reason why we

2870.8 --> 2875.6800000000003
shouldn't bomb the [ __ ] out of the

2872.88 --> 2878.88
entire place it's already dead most of

2875.68 --> 2882.24
the good people are already dead anyway

2878.88 --> 2884.559
it's all just demonic freaks on poisoned

2882.24 --> 2887.2799999999997
dead land now

2884.559 --> 2889.44
let's just blow it up huh is that how

2887.28 --> 2891.76
you want to end

2889.44 --> 2895.8
is that is that what you want for your

2891.76 --> 2895.8
for your children and your grandchildren

2906.4 --> 2911.52
why do i like

2908.559 --> 2913.119
why do i talk like i am an american

2911.52 --> 2915.839
because i have

2913.119 --> 2915.839
deep sympathy

2921.76 --> 2926.0
i'm very much

2923.44 --> 2928.559
for american restoration also i think it

2926.0 --> 2932.079
is the main problem

2928.559 --> 2935.92
biggest problem in the world

2932.079 --> 2942.0
is the satanic system in america it's

2935.92 --> 2944.96
the biggest problem in the world

2942.0 --> 2947.28
that kind of makes me an american

2944.96 --> 2950.16
because it's my problem

2947.28 --> 2953.1600000000003
it's everybody's problem that that's

2950.16 --> 2953.16
there

2963.68 --> 2968.16
and for crying out loud americans at

2966.16 --> 2972.24
least they have

2968.16 --> 2972.96
still some ability to do something about

2972.24 --> 2974.8799999999997
it

2972.96 --> 2977.599
and they're just not

2974.88 --> 2977.599
doing it

2978.48 --> 2982.72
and that's

2979.68 --> 2984.96
just sickening to me it's sickening i

2982.72 --> 2988.48
don't understand

2984.96 --> 2990.0
i don't understand and it makes me hate

2988.48 --> 2993.04
americans

2990.0 --> 2995.28
it makes me hate you that you actually

2993.04 --> 3000.48
have the ability to do something about

2995.28 --> 3000.48
it and a duty contractually bound

3000.72 --> 3006.2
and you're just not

3002.72 --> 3006.2
doing it

3015.92 --> 3019.76
yeah yeah aries why do you think that

3018.4 --> 3021.92
yeah

3019.76 --> 3025.3590000000004
maybe it's because the founding fathers

3021.92 --> 3027.599
were an enormous inspiration

3025.359 --> 3030.72
for a whole

3027.599 --> 3033.28
class of people around the world not

3030.72 --> 3034.16
just america

3033.28 --> 3037.52
yeah

3034.16 --> 3040.72
just because oh it's nationalist

3037.52 --> 3041.599
oh that means everybody has to hate them

3040.72 --> 3045.04
no

3041.599 --> 3045.04
nationalism is good

3048.16 --> 3054.5589999999997
i want americans to be like that

3051.76 --> 3057.44
but yeah in order to be like that you

3054.559 --> 3060.2400000000002
gotta prevent devils from literally

3057.44 --> 3063.44
destroying everything

3060.24 --> 3068.839
including your own land and your own

3063.44 --> 3068.839
people and the life on it

3078.53 --> 3082.48
[Music]

3081.599 --> 3086.88
right

3082.48 --> 3089.04
i mean seriously americans need to stop

3086.88 --> 3089.04
just

3089.92 --> 3095.599
making themselves work slaves it's like

3092.64 --> 3097.1189999999997
it's all obsession over work work work

3095.599 --> 3100.8
and they don't realize like yeah what

3097.119 --> 3100.8
the [ __ ] are you working for

3101.119 --> 3104.4
where's the actual

3104.48 --> 3109.839
original soldiering spirit

3108.0 --> 3113.2
what's happened to this

3109.839 --> 3115.52
they all turn gay now

3113.2 --> 3117.7599999999998
and that means that if you have such an

3115.52 --> 3121.2
impulse that's a question to you have

3117.76 --> 3123.44
you turned gay now

3121.2 --> 3127.04
are you of the opinion that you're not

3123.44 --> 3127.04
supposed to give into that

3130.8 --> 3133.92
that you're not supposed to take

3132.88 --> 3136.559
like

3133.92 --> 3138.48
potentially fatal risk

3136.559 --> 3142.6400000000003
to band together

3138.48 --> 3142.64
and stop this madness

3145.2 --> 3148.5589999999997
it's

3146.2 --> 3151.4399999999996
contractually obligated in the

3148.559 --> 3154.2400000000002
constitution the only reason you have

3151.44 --> 3157.839
you even have guns is because of that

3154.24 --> 3160.24
piece of paper that obligates you to do

3157.839 --> 3160.24
that

3162.64 --> 3170.0789999999997
like guns are not just like trade

3166.0 --> 3173.599
resources like bars of gold or something

3170.079 --> 3177.559
you have them for a reason

3173.599 --> 3177.559
bound to the constitution

3189.68 --> 3194.319
yeah wrath that's that's really nice oh

3192.4 --> 3196.319
you can help every why don't you [ __ ]

3194.319 --> 3198.88
help yourself

3196.319 --> 3200.88
there's a demon there

3198.88 --> 3203.92
why don't you stop all then we can be

3200.88 --> 3207.2000000000003
nice to others what so the demon can

3203.92 --> 3210.16
abuse your slavish ignorance to help

3207.2 --> 3214.24
others to take the credit for themselves

3210.16 --> 3215.2
and [ __ ] everybody over with it

3214.24 --> 3218.16
oh

3215.2 --> 3220.0
yeah keep working to provide all those

3218.16 --> 3221.68
things for other people in other

3220.0 --> 3222.559
countries

3221.68 --> 3225.2799999999997
yeah

3222.559 --> 3227.44
or you could actually

3225.28 --> 3230.7200000000003
make your country

3227.44 --> 3232.2400000000002
unpossessed by the devil and get them

3230.72 --> 3234.9599999999996
out

3232.24 --> 3237.04
and guess what aid look at the freaking

3234.96 --> 3240.079
age that you could give

3237.04 --> 3241.68
if you'd actually do that after that

3240.079 --> 3243.76
yeah

3241.68 --> 3246.319
if you are able to surgically remove

3243.76 --> 3248.1600000000003
these corrupted demon worshippers out of

3246.319 --> 3249.68
there

3248.16 --> 3251.359
you think

3249.68 --> 3255.44
i think the aid

3251.359 --> 3257.44
would be significantly more effective

3255.44 --> 3258.64
after that point that you can give other

3257.44 --> 3262.119
people

3258.64 --> 3262.1189999999997
in other countries

3270.559 --> 3273.559
um

3286.96 --> 3290.839
it's all about nation built yeah but you

3288.799 --> 3295.28
can still do

3290.839 --> 3298.64
that just get rid of the demons in your

3295.28 --> 3302.2400000000002
own nation first

3298.64 --> 3305.2
dude if you accomplish that as america

3302.24 --> 3308.16
after that point people

3305.2 --> 3310.64
will be like eager they will be like oh

3308.16 --> 3312.5589999999997
america yeah get you oh can we can you

3314.0 --> 3318.16

3315.839 --> 3320.5589999999997
it used to be like that

3318.16 --> 3323.2799999999997
it can be like that again there's only

3320.559 --> 3324.48
one condition though you have to stop

3323.28 --> 3327.92
being

3324.48 --> 3330.16
represented and controlled by demonic

3327.92 --> 3333.359
freaks first

3330.16 --> 3335.839
who are ruining everything

3333.359 --> 3337.7599999999998

3335.839 --> 3339.359
america's help now

3337.76 --> 3340.7990000000004
right

3339.359 --> 3343.2799999999997
it's almost like a

3340.799 --> 3345.68
demonic trade-off at itself like a

3343.28 --> 3347.76
government might be like oh yeah come in

3345.68 --> 3350.16
they know america's gonna [ __ ]

3347.76 --> 3352.7990000000004
everything over it's like oh that means

3350.16 --> 3355.2
you have to do the gay [ __ ] now and this

3352.799 --> 3357.7599999999998
and that they're gonna try to ruin your

3355.2 --> 3360.3999999999996
culture oh but they'll still give money

3357.76 --> 3363.3590000000004
or something right enough printing press

3360.4 --> 3367.119
money to bribe [ __ ] with

3363.359 --> 3369.7599999999998
they always come to ruin things to ruin

3367.119 --> 3371.6800000000003
your culture it's what america does now

3369.76 --> 3373.44

3371.68 --> 3376.72
have taken over

3373.44 --> 3379.28
do something about it stop them

3376.72 --> 3382.319
and then countries will be eager

3379.28 --> 3384.1600000000003
to get your help again

3382.319 --> 3386.24
don't you want that

3384.16 --> 3388.319
don't you want that back

3386.24 --> 3390.64
if you do you're gonna have to do

3388.319 --> 3392.5589999999997
something for it and take potentially

3390.64 --> 3395.52
lethal risk

3392.559 --> 3395.52
in doing so

3397.28 --> 3402.079
otherwise it's just going to be the most

3399.92 --> 3404.7200000000003

because america's [ __ ] government is

3740.64 --> 3745.68
there

3741.92 --> 3747.44
to keep everything demonic around the

blaming the russians they're just doing

5188.48 --> 5194.08
it to their own and

5509.44 --> 5512.719
so i'm just

5515.92 --> 5522.88
oh this entire [ __ ] up situation if

5519.12 --> 5525.5199999999995
well thank god people are not like

5522.88 --> 5527.84
everywhere like

5525.52 --> 5530.84
on when i go out for groceries into the

5527.84 --> 5533.4400000000005
city like there's one place where i saw

5530.84 --> 5535.679
somebody it's not even like a store

5533.44 --> 5538.48
where they hung on a ukrainian flag

5535.679 --> 5540.96
because they're just a bunch of idiots

5538.48 --> 5543.919999999999
one right and i'm like oh god

5540.96 --> 5546.4800000000005
that's it so i'm like okay okay at least

5543.92 --> 5550.2390000000005
not everybody's all zealous about it

5546.48 --> 5550.239
thank god it's not that bad

5550.56 --> 5553.52
right

5551.84 --> 5556.159000000001
but when did you just think what

5553.52 --> 5557.76
everything that preceded this situation

5556.159 --> 5560.719
now with ukraine everything that

5557.76 --> 5562.639
proceeded in like the last

5560.719 --> 5565.6
decade

5562.639 --> 5567.52
it just makes me want to scream and cry

5565.6 --> 5569.6
at the same time and just

5567.52 --> 5572.56
like

5569.6 --> 5574.8
start choking people it's so annoying

5572.56 --> 5577.84
it's so wrong everything about it is

5574.8 --> 5577.84
just horrific

5579.04 --> 5584.4
so

5581.36 --> 5588.32
inside out everything they do is a lie

5584.4 --> 5591.28
and it's such a terrible atrocious lie

5588.32 --> 5594.0
it's beyond

5591.28 --> 5595.12
beyond all levels of sensibility it's

5594.0 --> 5597.36
just

5595.12 --> 5598.719
straight forward

5597.36 --> 5600.719
evil

5598.719 --> 5602.639
straight forward

5600.719 --> 5605.52
evil

5602.639 --> 5606.32
there's no excuse that can be made for

5605.52 --> 5610.679
this

5606.32 --> 5610.679
it's just evil

5616.8 --> 5619.8
okay

5624.0 --> 5627.689
[Music]

5636.639 --> 5642.32
so yeah i'm with russia

5639.36 --> 5645.199
i said it not taking it back

5642.32 --> 5648.799999999999
if you have a lick of sense

5645.199 --> 5648.799999999999
you'll take the same posture

5651.199 --> 5655.08
overt or covert

5658.639 --> 5664.92
do you only have a pirate flag

5661.199 --> 5664.919999999999
oh that's kind of gay

5676.719 --> 5680.639
unless you're like really into a

5678.32 --> 5683.5199999999995
reenactment or something

5680.639 --> 5685.1990000000005
i mean if you also have an actual iron

5683.52 --> 5687.1990000000005
cast cannon

5685.199 --> 5690.08
then i'd say okay then it's not

5687.199 --> 5692.32
necessarily gay

5690.08 --> 5692.32
right

5695.76 --> 5699.4400000000005
i mean if you have a real iron cast

5697.76 --> 5703.119000000001
cannon then at least you're not a butt

5699.44 --> 5703.119
pirate necessarily

5708.639 --> 5711.679
just that i don't know where i'm going

5710.159 --> 5713.679
with this

5711.679 --> 5717.28
i'm just kidding guys if you're into

5713.679 --> 5721.719
pirates like do you har matey

5717.28 --> 5721.719
i get it it's kind of fun

5733.67 --> 5736.959
[Music]

5738.719 --> 5741.719
r

5743.36 --> 5749.36
it's so funny now thinking about that r

5746.08 --> 5752.36
r like you mean a radius value

5749.36 --> 5752.36
r

5759.44 --> 5762.08
what is that

5767.119 --> 5771.839999999999
is that a russian flag or something

5772.88 --> 5776.639
hmm

5773.84 --> 5779.4400000000005
all right fine

5776.639 --> 5781.52
i'm okay with that

5779.44 --> 5783.839999999999
you know it's like almost the same as

5781.52 --> 5785.76
the dutch flag right the only difference

5783.84 --> 5788.2390000000005
is that

5785.76 --> 5790.719
the white and the blue are interchanged

5788.239 --> 5793.839999999999
that's all

5790.719 --> 5793.84
pretty much identical

5795.6 --> 5800.320000000001
no wait no

5797.44 --> 5803.199
red white blue

5800.32 --> 5808.84
white blue red right anyway

5803.199 --> 5808.839999999999
it's scrolled it's disgust flag

5812.239 --> 5816.48
it always did kind of stand out to me

5814.48 --> 5818.4
that like the colors of the flags they

5816.48 --> 5820.48
do matter it's weird

5818.4 --> 5821.679
like britain and the netherlands and

5820.48 --> 5823.678999999999
russia

5821.679 --> 5827.56
and america pretty much have the same

5823.679 --> 5827.56
flag color wise

5834.639 --> 5838.719
what did the pirates say when he crossed

5836.8 --> 5842.08
the equator

5838.719 --> 5845.119
you would need r for that

5842.08 --> 5845.119
that's a good one rh

5851.28 --> 5855.84
when is orange day

5853.6 --> 5855.84
what

5857.199 --> 5860.96
i don't think we have one

5861.92 --> 5867.04
we have a king's day though used to be

5864.639 --> 5869.1990000000005
queens day

5867.04 --> 5873.28
that's king's day

5869.199 --> 5873.28
and it is somewhere at the end of april

5874.0 --> 5878.719
and it's accompanied by some like uh

5879.28 --> 5883.44
yeah

5880.84 --> 5885.84
like free market

5883.44 --> 5888.32
thing where everybody basically can sell

5885.84 --> 5892.52
their junk on the market if they want

5888.32 --> 5892.5199999999995
and nobody has to pay taxes

5912.08 --> 5917.88
pirates are criminals running under

5913.679 --> 5917.88
maritime no no no it's privateers

5919.28 --> 5923.759999999999
right they might be criminals but they

5921.84 --> 5927.84
are operating as you said under maritime

5923.76 --> 5927.84
law so they're technically not criminals

5931.04 --> 5934.719
right there is

5932.48 --> 5936.159
there is a law it's just that if you're

5934.719 --> 5938.2390000000005
not caught

5936.159 --> 5940.4
doing it then there's literally nobody

5938.239 --> 5943.119
that can really enforce it

5940.4 --> 5946.239
so it gets kind of fuzzy

5943.119 --> 5946.239
it's a pirate's life

5948.239 --> 5952.4
but technically they're not criminals

5950.159 --> 5954.96
unless they start raiding

5952.4 --> 5957.679
nations right then they're in that

5954.96 --> 5961.44
nation they're a criminal

5957.679 --> 5961.4400000000005
but on the sea they're technically not

5962.4 --> 5966.159
doesn't mean that like those nations

5964.4 --> 5967.92
that they've looted that they're not

5966.159 --> 5969.92
gonna do anything about them they're

5967.92 --> 5971.84
still gonna send ships over on sea and

5969.92 --> 5973.36
then just go at them

5971.84 --> 5974.8
but

5973.36 --> 5976.239
yeah

5974.8 --> 5980.28
anyway

5976.239 --> 5980.28
talking about pirates now

5983.84 --> 5993.909000000001
hmm

5986.79 --> 5993.909
[Music]

5999.52 --> 6002.0
okay

6003.6 --> 6007.08
that's weird

6014.32 --> 6018.719
hmm that made me think borders boy

6016.8 --> 6020.8
that's weird

6018.719 --> 6022.56
if that's really the case and it's like

6020.8 --> 6026.2390000000005
very widely

6022.56 --> 6031.119000000001
then you could almost say that

6026.239 --> 6032.159
legally the flood never ended

6031.119 --> 6034.239
right

6032.159 --> 6035.759999999999
everything is under maritime law even on

6034.239 --> 6037.839999999999
the land

6035.76 --> 6041.56
then you could say that legally the

6037.84 --> 6041.56
flood never ended

6054.4 --> 6058.32
or that it kind of just started up and

6056.48 --> 6060.48
it's now it is maxim if everything is

6058.32 --> 6061.759999999999
now under maritime law even though there

6060.48 --> 6064.32
is

6061.76 --> 6066.2390000000005
plenty of dry land

6064.32 --> 6069.599999999999
and then they're acting like as if there

6066.239 --> 6072.0
is a flood because yeah

6069.6 --> 6072.0
weird

6072.239 --> 6075.5199999999995
but

6073.6 --> 6076.719
wouldn't it technically then be true

6075.52 --> 6081.52
that

6076.719 --> 6081.52
you could just reclaim law of the land

6081.76 --> 6086.08
out of nothing like literally just make

6084.0 --> 6089.199
the move and just declare law of land

6086.08 --> 6092.48
like this is land now

6089.199 --> 6094.0
it's not going to be like a sea

6092.48 --> 6097.599999999999
it's not going to be maritime law

6094.0 --> 6099.36
anymore we're like we basically declare

6097.6 --> 6100.320000000001
law of the land

6099.36 --> 6103.44
and then

6100.32 --> 6104.48
also stand by to enforce it right

6103.44 --> 6108.239
is that

6104.48 --> 6108.239
could that be done legally

6108.32 --> 6111.32
hmm

6122.159 --> 6126.32
okay from the do you ever think we'll

6124.159 --> 6129.599999999999
ever figure out a way to stop reverse

6126.32 --> 6131.5199999999995
aging of the body yeah it's called not

6129.6 --> 6136.88
sinning

6131.52 --> 6136.88
yeah that's how you do it stop sinning

6137.76 --> 6142.88
that's how you actually stop aging of

6140.159 --> 6142.879999999999
the body because

6143.04 --> 6146.84
i'm i'm kind of certain

6145.679 --> 6149.76
this is

6146.84 --> 6152.8
esoteric that age

6149.76 --> 6156.88
does actually come out of sin which can

6152.8 --> 6156.88
be in any form negligence

6157.28 --> 6162.0
even

6159.52 --> 6164.400000000001
or just like

6162.0 --> 6167.119
yeah any micro sin

6164.4 --> 6171.04
will burden you will weaken you

6167.119 --> 6175.32
will cause a strain on your overall body

6171.04 --> 6175.32
which ages you

6176.48 --> 6181.28
so yeah stop sinning

6179.92 --> 6183.6
and you'll

6181.28 --> 6188.84
if you actually accomplish that it's

6183.6 --> 6188.84
likely that you will age less

6190.159 --> 6192.4
right

6202.96 --> 6209.92
i mean the sin is even like through

6206.32 --> 6212.239
folklore is written on somebody's body

6209.92 --> 6215.1990000000005
right it's written the sin is written on

6212.239 --> 6215.199
the face why

6215.28 --> 6219.679
because sin

6216.88 --> 6221.679
changes you it strains on you and it

6219.679 --> 6224.08
forms you it chisels you it's the

6221.679 --> 6225.679
devil's chisel

6224.08 --> 6228.0
that shapes

6225.679 --> 6230.719
you partially

6228.0 --> 6233.199
so don't sin

6230.719 --> 6235.52
and then there will be no chiseling or

6233.199 --> 6239.199
barely any although there's always going

6235.52 --> 6241.84
to be some sin in some form right

6239.199 --> 6244.0
you can't be completely without it

6241.84 --> 6244.0
like

6244.08 --> 6249.159
yeah

6244.96 --> 6249.159
that's mechanically impossible

6284.159 --> 6289.0
sinning can't no

6286.0 --> 6289.0
no

6294.56 --> 6298.320000000001
no actual sinning isn't fun

6298.48 --> 6302.5599999999995
right

6299.44 --> 6307.119
fun can have a price

6302.56 --> 6308.0
if you don't do it as a sin

6307.119 --> 6309.28
then

6308.0 --> 6313.119
it's not

6309.28 --> 6317.84
like gonna have the weight of a sin

6313.119 --> 6320.639
sinning is actually not fun

6317.84 --> 6322.0
it's usually compulsive right

6320.639 --> 6324.8
it's like this

6322.0 --> 6326.48
if you're potentially an alcoholic right

6324.8 --> 6328.639
and you have a couple of drinks for the

6326.48 --> 6329.678999999999
first time it's going to be like whoa

6328.639 --> 6331.76
dude

6329.679 --> 6334.4800000000005
this is awesome and you feel free and

6331.76 --> 6335.679
you're like more courageous perhaps

6334.48 --> 6337.5199999999995
right

6335.679 --> 6340.639
well if you then

6337.52 --> 6342.159000000001
like can't let it go

6340.639 --> 6345.84
and you keep doing it and then you

6342.159 --> 6346.799999999999
become an alcoholic that's not fun

6345.84 --> 6348.96
you see

6346.8 --> 6353.04
sinning isn't fun

6348.96 --> 6355.92
the sin itself isn't fun it's a weakness

6353.04 --> 6359.28
it isn't enjoyed

6355.92 --> 6360.96
people that sin often try to do that as

6359.28 --> 6362.96
an escape

6360.96 --> 6364.96
right escaping the consciousness which

6362.96 --> 6367.96
is a sin by itself

6364.96 --> 6367.96
escapism

6373.6 --> 6377.679
sinning is not fun it's a weakness

6379.28 --> 6384.5199999999995
if it's just fun it's not sin

6386.32 --> 6391.36
if there's like

6387.679 --> 6393.4400000000005
the hurt in there or it's like

6391.36 --> 6396.0
yeah if there's damage

6393.44 --> 6398.239
then it becomes a sin

6396.0 --> 6400.4
if you're doing something

6398.239 --> 6403.36
because you're want to escape from

6400.4 --> 6405.599999999999
whatever you're feeling

6403.36 --> 6408.0
then it's not going to be fun you see

6405.6 --> 6411.04
it's just going to be numbing yourself

6408.0 --> 6413.84
down that's not fun

6411.04 --> 6417.36
then it becomes a sin

6413.84 --> 6420.2390000000005
if you naturally do something

6417.36 --> 6423.04
just because you want to enjoy something

6420.239 --> 6423.04
it's not a sin

6423.199 --> 6428.239
it's the intention

6425.199 --> 6430.879999999999
and the reason the context of why you're

6428.239 --> 6433.28
doing something that makes it a sin or

6430.88 --> 6436.0
not to you right this is not about

6433.28 --> 6437.92
judging each other this is about despair

6436.0 --> 6442.199
oh [ __ ]

6437.92 --> 6442.1990000000005
this is about the spiritual mechanics

6442.8 --> 6446.08
just

6444.08 --> 6450.199
ouch

6446.08 --> 6450.199
i almost cut myself there

6461.6 --> 6465.52
no robert titchell it's just gross

6467.92 --> 6473.1990000000005
and it's not fun that's

6470.48 --> 6476.239
literally delusion and a lie

6473.199 --> 6481.879999999999
to convince yourself that it's okay

6476.239 --> 6481.879999999999
it's not if it was a sin it isn't fun

6488.08 --> 6493.5199999999995
that's right tara 306

6490.4 --> 6495.759999999999
because the context and the angle of

6493.52 --> 6497.76
approach for your spirit is everything

6495.76 --> 6500.2390000000005
it is really the thing that determines

6497.76 --> 6504.0
whether it's a sin or not

6500.239 --> 6504.0
like why do you do it

6506.48 --> 6508.799999999999
right

6508.96 --> 6515.92
and it is palpable the results are there

6513.52 --> 6518.56
if you do one thing for a reason and

6515.92 --> 6519.52
it's just natural and you let it go it's

6518.56 --> 6522.320000000001
cool

6519.52 --> 6523.92
if you do it later

6522.32 --> 6525.5199999999995
because you're trying to hold on to

6523.92 --> 6527.4400000000005
something because you don't want to face

6525.52 --> 6529.6
the current development and the current

6527.44 --> 6531.28
energy that you're faced with

6529.6 --> 6534.320000000001
it's escapism

6531.28 --> 6536.08
that becomes a sin and then how hard do

6534.32 --> 6539.599999999999
you hold on to it determine the

6536.08 --> 6542.08
amplitude of the sin you see

6539.6 --> 6545.52
so it's not about taking that drink it

6542.08 --> 6549.5199999999995
is about why are you taking it

6545.52 --> 6552.080000000001
that is the real determining factor

6549.52 --> 6553.040000000001
that will

6552.08 --> 6555.599
let you

6553.04 --> 6558.8
predict how it's going to unroll and

6555.599 --> 6561.1990000000005
influence you how the the reaction

6558.8 --> 6563.360000000001
from within creation the punishment if

6561.199 --> 6564.96
you will for the sin

6563.36 --> 6566.0
[Music]

6564.96 --> 6567.36
right

6566.0 --> 6569.84
it's not a sin then there's no

6567.36 --> 6569.839999999999
punishment

6580.0 --> 6584.56
right and it's complicated because if

6582.48 --> 6586.879999999999
you literally don't have the centuries

6584.56 --> 6587.76
to even pick up

6586.88 --> 6591.04
sin

6587.76 --> 6591.84
or you somehow bypass its influence on

6591.04 --> 6594.48
you

6591.84 --> 6596.159000000001
like you don't feel any different you're

6594.48 --> 6598.959999999999
not getting burdened by it even though

6596.159 --> 6602.32
it's something that is technically bad

6598.96 --> 6604.56
then the sin response will manifest

6602.32 --> 6605.679
through others

6604.56 --> 6608.080000000001
right

6605.679 --> 6611.599
through others

6608.08 --> 6614.0
because others might see you doing that

6611.599 --> 6615.4400000000005
without any problem then they think

6614.0 --> 6617.599
you're psycho

6615.44 --> 6619.119
you're dangerous or

6617.599 --> 6621.28
like

6619.119 --> 6623.119
you're encouraging people to do bad

6621.28 --> 6625.36
things oh you can handle it but you're

6623.119 --> 6627.759999999999
bad you're you're treating it like it's

6625.36 --> 6629.44
no problem

6627.76 --> 6631.1990000000005
and other people might do that and then

6629.44 --> 6633.199
they'd get into trouble

6631.199 --> 6635.759999999999
so that way

6633.199 --> 6639.119
it still is a sin

6635.76 --> 6641.119000000001
just becomes indirect

6639.119 --> 6643.44
you see

6641.119 --> 6647.28
this is the

6643.44 --> 6650.5599999999995
the heavy complicated nature

6647.28 --> 6650.5599999999995
of spirit mechanics and

6650.84 --> 6658.04
sin i hope you guys are following me

6653.92 --> 6658.04
hello by the way nathan oakley

6673.76 --> 6677.4400000000005
right so

6675.679 --> 6679.119
basically

6677.44 --> 6682.799999999999
little sims

6679.119 --> 6684.48
like micro sins like micro aggression

6682.8 --> 6687.360000000001
micro sins

6684.48 --> 6691.119
also give you a bearing as to what is

6687.36 --> 6693.199
real and not right sometimes

6691.119 --> 6695.36
i like to do something that's out of the

6693.199 --> 6698.159
ordinary

6695.36 --> 6698.159
to test it

6700.239 --> 6703.919999999999
right i'm noticing like oh i'm doing

6702.239 --> 6705.5199999999995
this constantly in this setup and

6703.92 --> 6708.96
everything is like pretty much the same

6705.52 --> 6711.280000000001
okay let's change this and see if it's

6708.96 --> 6713.92
different

6711.28 --> 6716.5599999999995
it's like experimentary it's

6713.92 --> 6719.599
experimentation

6716.56 --> 6720.4800000000005
to notice is there a difference

6719.599 --> 6723.92
to

6720.48 --> 6726.48
figure out what's the influence of it

6723.92 --> 6731.56
is it actually sinful will i be better

6726.48 --> 6731.5599999999995
without it right that sort of thing

6736.4 --> 6741.5199999999995
if you mess up at work by mistake is

6738.8 --> 6741.52
that a sin

6742.88 --> 6748.639
that all depends on the the nature and

6745.119 --> 6748.639
the context of the mistake

6748.719 --> 6751.92
if

6749.52 --> 6754.159000000001
you made the mistake because you were

6751.92 --> 6758.4
negligent

6754.159 --> 6760.879999999999
and you allowed yourself to become

6758.4 --> 6763.28
in a situation where you would easily

6760.88 --> 6766.88
make the mistake you could have seen it

6763.28 --> 6769.599
coming then yes then it is a sin

6766.88 --> 6771.1990000000005
if despite you doing your best you can

6769.599 --> 6773.04
still make a mistake

6771.199 --> 6776.879999999999
and it can even ruin a whole bunch of

6773.04 --> 6779.36
[ __ ] but then nobody is going to be like

6776.88 --> 6780.639
well dude it's all your fault because

6779.36 --> 6783.598999999999
you

6780.639 --> 6785.36
you didn't do your best or you you just

6783.599 --> 6786.96
you're useless right no that people

6785.36 --> 6788.639
aren't gonna do if you actually do your

6786.96 --> 6790.8
best you can still make a mistake and

6788.639 --> 6793.52
then nobody's gonna really be like oh

6790.8 --> 6795.28
that guy right but if you're sloppy as

6793.52 --> 6798.0
[ __ ]

6795.28 --> 6799.759999999999
and you built up to those mistakes then

6798.0 --> 6801.76
they are gonna blame you

6799.76 --> 6804.76
because you didn't do your best

6801.76 --> 6804.76
right

6813.119 --> 6817.598999999999
all right and boss is being angry with

6815.44 --> 6820.08
you it doesn't automatically mean that

6817.599 --> 6822.159000000001
it's a sin that's just because he has

6820.08 --> 6824.5599999999995
responsibilities

6822.159 --> 6827.119
and if somebody makes a mistake then he

6824.56 --> 6829.1990000000005
has to basically take the hit of that

6827.119 --> 6834.5199999999995
and he might not be very happy about it

6829.199 --> 6834.5199999999995
has nothing to do with sin on its own

6838.48 --> 6842.5599999999995
right you might simply be frustrated

6845.52 --> 6850.719
hello

6846.84 --> 6850.719
psycbear a wrath

6854.08 --> 6858.5599999999995
oh wait i think you're already here for

6856.159 --> 6858.5599999999995
a while

6867.28 --> 6870.639
right so yeah just

6870.8 --> 6877.679
the way i address sin

6874.159 --> 6880.719
is not the same format as that it has

6877.679 --> 6881.76
become like through catholicism

6880.719 --> 6885.679
right

6881.76 --> 6887.76
i see that entire concept as a complete

6885.679 --> 6888.84
atrocity

6887.76 --> 6890.639
it is

6888.84 --> 6892.88
absolutely

6890.639 --> 6892.88
wrong

6896.08 --> 6899.92
because

6897.36 --> 6901.839999999999
yeah i go by spirit mechanics which is

6899.92 --> 6904.96
much more subtle

6901.84 --> 6907.679
and more complex

6904.96 --> 6910.32
it is more complex

6907.679 --> 6914.08
that way right you can't just have like

6910.32 --> 6916.719
10 rules and it's all yeah go just

6914.08 --> 6918.96
abide by those rules and oversimplify

6916.719 --> 6921.28
everything to a company

6918.96 --> 6923.44
to accommodate those right that's not

6921.28 --> 6926.5599999999995
what i do it's for me it's an analysis

6923.44 --> 6929.28
this is just a mechanism and sin is an

6926.56 --> 6932.56
effect it's something that happens that

6929.28 --> 6936.239
we can empirically deduce

6932.56 --> 6938.320000000001
through our actions and the way we think

6936.239 --> 6940.48
during those actions and the reason the

6938.32 --> 6942.88
context for those actions

6940.48 --> 6946.159
i think that is where the true nature of

6942.88 --> 6947.36
sin and the price that comes forth from

6946.159 --> 6949.199
it

6947.36 --> 6952.96
that's where we can find that and

6949.199 --> 6952.96
analyze that and figure it out

6955.92 --> 6959.28
right so

6957.04 --> 6963.679
way i talk about sin is it is a

6959.28 --> 6963.679
different definition from the classical

6964.0 --> 6966.719
sin

6965.36 --> 6969.96
that we know

6966.719 --> 6969.96
from catholicism

6974.08 --> 6979.92
if you don't believe in sin can you sin

6976.08 --> 6982.0
yeah you don't have to be aware of it

6979.92 --> 6983.28
it just happens

6982.0 --> 6984.8
right

6983.28 --> 6986.159
i mean

6984.8 --> 6988.96
if you're gonna

6986.159 --> 6991.04
steal a cookie from a jar

6988.96 --> 6992.719
and you don't know that stealing and

6991.04 --> 6996.239
you're not supposed to do that it's

6992.719 --> 6998.0
still gonna have the results right

6996.239 --> 7000.638999999999
the cookie is still gonna be missed the

6998.0 --> 7002.08
parents still gonna be pissed off

7000.639 --> 7004.0
now they might be also pissed off

7002.08 --> 7006.239
because they didn't tell you or they

7004.0 --> 7007.92
didn't expect it they didn't anticipate

7006.239 --> 7010.879999999999
but it's going to have an effect and

7007.92 --> 7010.88
that's how you know

7012.32 --> 7015.04
right

7013.28 --> 7017.84
recognize a sin

7015.04 --> 7022.639
by the response

7017.84 --> 7022.639
the response from the creation

7025.04 --> 7028.88
so yeah you can definitely sin without

7027.119 --> 7031.28
being aware of it

7028.88 --> 7034.400000000001
and you'll find out and

7031.28 --> 7037.28
it might even reinforce the sin if you

7034.4 --> 7040.799999999999
refuse to become aware of it

7037.28 --> 7044.92
if you basically deny that it is

7040.8 --> 7044.92
then it becomes even worse

7055.04 --> 7059.0
stop projecting sean

7059.76 --> 7063.84
like your first entry here is a pure

7061.599 --> 7065.92
projection i'm gonna ban you if you're

7063.84 --> 7069.04
gonna act like that i i was into that

7065.92 --> 7071.4400000000005
yesterday i'm not into that now

7069.04 --> 7073.84
i don't need your [ __ ] stains all over

7071.44 --> 7073.839999999999
my chat

7090.719 --> 7093.719

7100.719 --> 7104.159
oh hello by the way robert b

weather's way too beautiful for that

7130.48 --> 7133.879999999999
sort of nonsense

7159.84 --> 7164.719
don't ask him anything he's banned

7162.0 --> 7164.719
matthew hall

7165.92 --> 7171.84
don't ask people questions that just got

7168.159 --> 7171.839999999999
banned that's just rude

7177.84 --> 7183.639
hello this ousman nice

7180.4 --> 7183.638999999999
at home

7190.159 --> 7194.719
i mean yay nice

7192.48 --> 7197.44
piece of clothing that i've literally

7194.719 --> 7200.56
been wearing for what is it now four

7197.44 --> 7200.5599999999995
years pretty much

7201.44 --> 7207.759999999999
that you can see almost every day except

7204.719 --> 7210.08
maybe in like hot summer

7207.76 --> 7210.08
yeah

7210.159 --> 7215.4
great analysis tim osman great entry

7217.4 --> 7220.65
[Music]

7229.76 --> 7235.4400000000005
yeah that's right ares 106 you could be

7232.48 --> 7238.159
doing a sin and not realizing it

7235.44 --> 7241.44
you'll find out eventually because

7238.159 --> 7242.638999999999
a sin always has a consequence

7241.44 --> 7243.919999999999
right

7242.639 --> 7245.36
you might be

7243.92 --> 7248.159
in the

7245.36 --> 7250.159
idea the opinion that doing something

7248.159 --> 7252.08
which you've done all your life is just

7250.159 --> 7254.96
normal and okay

7252.08 --> 7256.239
but then at some point people

7254.96 --> 7259.599
might

7256.239 --> 7261.598999999999
become knowledgeable about that and then

7259.599 --> 7263.28
confront you like dude what the hell are

7261.599 --> 7265.1990000000005
you doing

7263.28 --> 7266.96
that's evil

7265.199 --> 7270.719
and then you might be like what what

7266.96 --> 7273.679
what right and then you get the choice

7270.719 --> 7276.32
upon becoming conscious are you gonna

7273.679 --> 7277.04
double down and defend it

7276.32 --> 7279.119
and

7277.04 --> 7281.119
merge with the sin

7279.119 --> 7283.199
like basically bind yourself

7281.119 --> 7285.04
contractually to it

7283.199 --> 7286.719
with the demon that comes with it that

7285.04 --> 7289.599
will take you

7286.719 --> 7294.04
or are you going to step away now that

7289.599 --> 7294.04
you've realized it is a sin

7298.88 --> 7302.400000000001
right but yeah

7300.55 --> 7305.04
[Music]

7302.4 --> 7307.679
doing a sin not knowing it

7305.04 --> 7309.5199999999995
i don't see why that's scary right all

7307.679 --> 7311.92
kids go through that

7309.52 --> 7314.320000000001
all kids they do things they don't know

7311.92 --> 7316.2390000000005
it's a sin

7314.32 --> 7319.28
it doesn't yeah

7316.239 --> 7320.4
we expect you have to like try things

7319.28 --> 7325.159
out

7320.4 --> 7325.159
even to find out if it is a sin

7331.04 --> 7336.0
i see why that's scary right because

7333.679 --> 7339.1990000000005
this sin is not the thing that's gonna

7336.0 --> 7341.44
take away your soul from into hell and

7339.199 --> 7343.678999999999
eternal damnation that's not what i'm

7341.44 --> 7345.919999999999
talking about you see

7343.679 --> 7347.76
i'm talking about spirit mechanics

7345.92 --> 7350.88
within the design

7347.76 --> 7353.599
of the physical realm that we are

7350.88 --> 7355.36
present in at this time that's what i'm

7353.599 --> 7359.400000000001
talking about

7355.36 --> 7359.4
not talking about afterlife

7371.86 --> 7376.159
[Music]

7374.159 --> 7378.879999999999
everyone said no

7376.159 --> 7381.598999999999
everybody apart from that that's not

7378.88 --> 7383.28
relevant

7381.599 --> 7387.4800000000005
and you don't know what's going on in

7383.28 --> 7387.48
the baby's mind it's not relevant

7397.679 --> 7402.88
but yeah effectively

7399.84 --> 7405.28
life is comprised of a giant chain of

7402.88 --> 7408.08
sins and how you deal with them

7405.28 --> 7411.759999999999
is the thing that matters right it's sin

7408.08 --> 7411.76
is all about the consciousness

7412.0 --> 7416.96
like how are you dealing with the

7414.639 --> 7418.400000000001
realization of what something is and

7416.96 --> 7421.119
does

7418.4 --> 7423.199
that's what really matters

7421.119 --> 7426.88
you're always gonna face in

7423.199 --> 7426.879999999999
throughout your life all the time

7427.84 --> 7433.0
that's how you respond to it that

7430.0 --> 7433.0
matters

7452.4 --> 7457.598999999999
yeah but innocent ares 106 is different

7458.0 --> 7462.159
because you're there just because you're

7459.599 --> 7463.52
innocent doesn't mean that you don't sin

7462.159 --> 7468.879999999999
right

7463.52 --> 7468.88
innocence is about not being aware of it

7468.96 --> 7472.2390000000005
doesn't mean that you don't sin

7471.04 --> 7474.8
right

7472.239 --> 7477.04
i mean as a little kid you could still

7474.8 --> 7479.119000000001
have like

7477.04 --> 7480.079
you want to slap your brother

7479.119 --> 7482.48
right

7480.079 --> 7484.32
because you feel like it does that make

7482.48 --> 7486.32
it a sin when you don't realize that

7484.32 --> 7488.5599999999995
that's actually sinful

7486.32 --> 7490.239
no until

7488.56 --> 7492.719
your parents tell you like hey don't do

7490.239 --> 7494.32
that that's mean

7492.719 --> 7496.8
that hurts your brother

7494.32 --> 7499.759999999999
think about him

7496.8 --> 7503.84
right and then they get to choose like

7499.76 --> 7505.76
am i gonna do i really like doing this

7503.84 --> 7507.4400000000005
am i not gonna give a [ __ ] that my

7505.76 --> 7508.2390000000005
brother hurts

7507.44 --> 7510.32
right

7508.239 --> 7512.959999999999
or am i gonna be like oh [ __ ] i didn't

7510.32 --> 7514.88
know that i don't wanna hurt him really

7512.96 --> 7518.2390000000005
it's just a weird impulse i'm gonna try

7514.88 --> 7518.2390000000005
to suppress it now right

7519.119 --> 7521.839999999999
that's how it works

7524.41 --> 7527.599999999999
[Music]

7545.76 --> 7550.320000000001
fight the flat earth realize they're

7546.96 --> 7550.32
using felicia's reasoning

7552.88 --> 7557.679
probably

7554.159 --> 7560.239
if they still know what actual sound

7557.679 --> 7563.28
reasoning even is anymore man on the

7560.239 --> 7565.28
edge they probably don't

7563.28 --> 7567.679
i think they've lost track over what

7565.28 --> 7569.04
basic sound reasoning is

7567.679 --> 7573.32
and therefore

7569.04 --> 7573.32
they think they're doing all right

7578.0 --> 7584.76
and just fully immersed in

7580.04 --> 7584.76
pseudoscientific way of doing things

7604.639 --> 7609.599
you've never seen you would just stay

7606.4 --> 7609.598999999999
baby forever right no

7610.88 --> 7614.599
no of course not

7619.84 --> 7627.92
no you can't stop the progression of

7623.36 --> 7629.92
growth in time it's just if you sin less

7627.92 --> 7632.159
you'll age less

7629.92 --> 7633.679
that's all i said you can't actually

7632.159 --> 7636.719
stop time

7633.679 --> 7639.1990000000005
right what we see as time you can't stop

7636.719 --> 7643.199
you are going to age you are going to

7639.199 --> 7645.44
die absolutely 100 guaranteed

7643.199 --> 7648.5599999999995
100 guaranteed right there's nothing

7645.44 --> 7649.839999999999
that's going to stop that

7648.56 --> 7651.76
but you could

7649.84 --> 7653.84
like stop

7651.76 --> 7655.360000000001
it from going faster

7653.84 --> 7658.32
by just

7655.36 --> 7661.719
not sitting by being smarter

7658.32 --> 7661.719
about it

7675.36 --> 7679.839999999999
but what

7676.48 --> 7679.839999999999
what kind of question is that

7680.56 --> 7685.679
and tara 306

7683.119 --> 7687.36
if you decide to be pure not sin are you

7685.679 --> 7689.04
rightfully king

7687.36 --> 7692.079
well no

7689.04 --> 7694.4
not in a legal way

7692.079 --> 7696.92
right and that is what a king is right

7694.4 --> 7700.4
in this context but spiritually

7696.92 --> 7702.4800000000005
esoterically yes

7700.4 --> 7704.079
you will be regarded

7702.48 --> 7706.718999999999
as such

7704.079 --> 7708.5599999999995
on a spiritual level because of it

7706.719 --> 7711.04
because of the purity

7708.56 --> 7714.4800000000005
people will

7711.04 --> 7714.48
want to do what you say

7714.96 --> 7719.52
people will admire you

7717.119 --> 7723.04
and in that ways on a spiritual level

7719.52 --> 7726.8
kind of see you as a king yes

7723.04 --> 7728.239
if you're completely or just like

7726.8 --> 7731.28
beyond

7728.239 --> 7733.5199999999995
or like how do you say that

7731.28 --> 7735.92
with so little sin that it's almost

7733.52 --> 7738.56
alien right

7735.92 --> 7740.32
that forces respect

7738.56 --> 7741.84
unless you're a demon and then it does

7740.32 --> 7744.84
the opposite

7741.84 --> 7744.84
right

7745.44 --> 7749.44
but yeah rightfully is tough word if

7747.679 --> 7750.88
you're gonna use that it's gonna be kind

7749.44 --> 7753.04
of legal

7750.88 --> 7756.400000000001
rightfully right

7753.04 --> 7759.199
but spiritually yeah you will become you

7756.4 --> 7760.5599999999995
will radiate like a king and people will

7759.199 --> 7763.919999999999
respect that

7760.56 --> 7763.92
it's a natural effect

7764.0 --> 7769.079
that explains brighton currency yeah no

7766.079 --> 7769.079
[ __ ]

7781.44 --> 7785.5199999999995
right yeah that's right man on the edge

7783.52 --> 7787.280000000001
yeah there is no infinity in physical

7785.52 --> 7790.56
reality

7787.28 --> 7792.88
infinity is a concept

7790.56 --> 7794.88
it only exists in math and in our

7792.88 --> 7797.84
imagination

7794.88 --> 7801.4400000000005
there is no infinity in physicality

7797.84 --> 7804.2390000000005
that's logically impossible

7801.44 --> 7806.638999999999
it can never be infinite amount of space

7804.239 --> 7808.32
infinite volume to be more precise and

7806.639 --> 7810.639
there cannot be an infinite amount of

7808.32 --> 7810.639
matter

7811.199 --> 7815.678999999999
energy however yeah well what energy is

7813.76 --> 7817.52
a concept by itself it's like a

7815.679 --> 7819.679
convention but

7817.52 --> 7822.159000000001
i don't know

7819.679 --> 7824.0
but when it comes to material substance

7822.159 --> 7826.48
and volume

7824.0 --> 7829.84
there can never be infinite amounts of

7826.48 --> 7829.839999999999
either never

7831.04 --> 7837.76
like i thought about that a lot

7833.92 --> 7837.76
i'd go into debates over that

7840.0 --> 7846.32
but maybe not now

7842.719 --> 7846.32
i think i'm gonna round out the show

7849.84 --> 7853.4400000000005
it's been a pretty good show actually

7854.48 --> 7862.44
there's some trolls but yeah

7857.92 --> 7862.4400000000005

7870.4 --> 7874.159

7950.56 --> 7955.1990000000005
like the more different subjects the

7953.04 --> 7957.92
more complicated it becomes to really

7955.199 --> 7959.839999999999
find a good unifying title
