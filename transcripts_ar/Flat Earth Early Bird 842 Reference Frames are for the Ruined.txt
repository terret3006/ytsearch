[Music]

78.0 --> 84.64
so today the weather's

81.439 --> 86.24
had a nice turnaround

84.64 --> 88.24
it's kind of very much like the

86.24 --> 92.15899999999999
background

88.24 --> 92.15899999999999
in the show right now see

92.64 --> 96.799
very very similar

97.6 --> 105.28
funny isn't that

101.68 --> 108.56
but yeah it's nice and sunny

105.28 --> 112.159
there's barely any kind of wind

108.56 --> 112.159
and the sun is nice and warm

112.84 --> 120.0
yeah a couple of hazy clouds up there

117.28 --> 122.64
it's not perfectly crystal clear blue

120.0 --> 125.36
and there's definitely some

122.64 --> 125.36
some trails

126.96 --> 131.76
but yeah it's nice turn around from all

130.479 --> 143.12
these cloudy days

131.76 --> 146.72
in the last week

143.12 --> 156.56
all right so

146.72 --> 159.519
it's wednesday the 24th of march 2021

156.56 --> 159.519
five minutes late

161.599 --> 166.56
roughly because like last minute i got

164.879 --> 169.76
really hungry

166.56 --> 170.239
i don't know why my system decided to

169.76 --> 172.239
wait

170.239 --> 174.16
right until i was gonna start the show

172.239 --> 176.239
to get really hungry

174.16 --> 179.519
but i thought okay i could be five

176.239 --> 182.159
minutes late and quickly get lunch

179.519 --> 184.0
or breakfast that would be for me or i

182.159 --> 186.239
could be hungry for two hours

184.0 --> 187.36
straight and then get lunch so i thought

186.239 --> 190.159
nah

187.36 --> 192.15900000000002
i'll just be five minutes late and i'm

190.159 --> 194.879
really happy i did because i feel a lot

192.159 --> 194.879
better right now

196.84 --> 199.84
also

200.959 --> 204.0
so i went to bed really early yesterday

203.68 --> 207.84
like

204.0 --> 207.84
really early before one o'clock

208.56 --> 213.12
and basically slept out as long as i

212.56 --> 217.12
could

213.12 --> 218.31900000000002
also to get my shoulder situation under

217.12 --> 221.04
control

218.319 --> 223.04
because it's been agitated and painful

221.04 --> 227.2
now for

223.04 --> 230.159
at least five days straight and

227.2 --> 230.879
yeah getting just this extra sleep i

230.159 --> 232.879
don't know

230.879 --> 236.79899999999998
i can it's hard to describe like the

232.879 --> 236.79899999999998
process things that happen but

236.879 --> 242.79899999999998
like it did really help but

241.12 --> 244.64000000000001
i think there's a very direct

242.799 --> 247.439
correlation

244.64 --> 249.2
maybe causation but at least correlation

247.439 --> 252.07999999999998
with the coffee

249.2 --> 253.11999999999998
and i've been drinking too much of it

252.08 --> 256.079
and that is like

253.12 --> 257.919
two oh my god two cups of coffee a day

256.079 --> 261.199
that's like

257.919 --> 262.88
so much man yeah

261.199 --> 265.28000000000003
i know i know right there's people

262.88 --> 270.24
drinking like 10

265.28 --> 270.23999999999995
20 on a day but for me

270.56 --> 276.88
yeah it always has had a

273.84 --> 279.67999999999995
pretty intense

276.88 --> 281.199
impact on my system and i'm just

279.68 --> 283.52
starting to feel it and i'm getting kind

281.199 --> 285.759
of sick of it

283.52 --> 287.35999999999996
like having a painful shoulder without

285.759 --> 289.91900000000004
actually doing sports

287.36 --> 292.8
in order to attain that painful shoulder

289.919 --> 296.71999999999997
or something you know

292.8 --> 299.04
people typically do get that

296.72 --> 300.08000000000004
like my brother had a lot of issues with

299.04 --> 303.6
his shoulder

300.08 --> 304.8
because of his climbing sport like got

303.6 --> 307.12
pretty serious

304.8 --> 308.88
oh i'm i'm not into climbing sports and

307.12 --> 312.16
i have a freaking painful shoulder for

308.88 --> 312.15999999999997
almost a week now so

313.759 --> 319.039
but i'll i'll get through it and i'm

316.479 --> 324.96
going to try to cut down on the coffee

319.039 --> 327.039
not get that extra second coffee anymore

324.96 --> 328.08
but it is kind of seducing in the

327.039 --> 330.71999999999997
evening

328.08 --> 330.71999999999997
to do that

333.84 --> 338.08
hello amanda young by the way first in

336.16 --> 341.68
chat tom parker

338.08 --> 343.75899999999996
good to see you so at least today i'm

341.68 --> 344.24
gonna feel better than i did yesterday

343.759 --> 347.91900000000004
because

344.24 --> 351.199
yesterday i really felt like [ __ ]

347.919 --> 354.88
and that's why for the entire show

351.199 --> 356.24
yesterday like 50 was just me not saying

354.88 --> 359.84
anything

356.24 --> 364.40000000000003
and i figured out why as well

359.84 --> 364.4
it was because i had a lot of like

365.68 --> 369.68
let's just say extreme frustration gamma

368.8 --> 371.44
impulses

369.68 --> 372.8
you know and when when you give that

371.44 --> 376.08
room

372.8 --> 376.88
only thing that comes out only thing is

376.08 --> 378.31899999999996
[ __ ]

376.88 --> 380.24
everything is [ __ ] everything that's

378.319 --> 381.68
gonna come out is only going to make

380.24 --> 384.40000000000003
things worse

381.68 --> 386.72
so i was just basically sitting there

384.4 --> 389.44
biting my tongue constantly

386.72 --> 391.199
preventing the idea from seeping through

389.44 --> 394.16
because i just didn't want to bother

391.199 --> 397.36
people with my nannying

394.16 --> 399.199
inside this is

397.36 --> 401.199
which i do have sometimes it's like

399.199 --> 403.91900000000004
extreme dissatisfaction and

401.199 --> 404.8
i don't dwell on it i like really try to

403.919 --> 408.0
prevent that

404.8 --> 412.72
most of the time

408.0 --> 416.88
and stick to more productive or ratings

412.72 --> 419.36
more creative more with a

416.88 --> 421.44
an angle to it that is productive that

419.36 --> 426.0
is building up

421.44 --> 428.08
so when that mechanism is no longer in

426.0 --> 430.479
place and i'm just dissatisfied

428.08 --> 433.039
just being like ah everybody is stupid

430.479 --> 436.639
everybody this everybody that

433.039 --> 440.4
yeah i'm just shutting up

436.639 --> 440.40000000000003
and i do it instinctively so

445.039 --> 452.71999999999997
because the best way to get out of that

449.52 --> 454.79999999999995
is to completely forget about it forget

452.72 --> 455.59900000000005
about the complaints forget about the

454.8 --> 458.16
issues just

455.599 --> 459.199
literally shove it all aside just like

458.16 --> 462.56
nope

459.199 --> 464.639
doesn't exist [ __ ] you world i'm not

462.56 --> 467.84
showing it

464.639 --> 470.879
it doesn't exist right then but yeah

467.84 --> 472.71999999999997
you don't get energy for it in its place

470.879 --> 474.96000000000004
because you're leaving all kinds of [ __ ]

472.72 --> 479.84000000000003
unresolved

474.96 --> 479.84
and that's why i become silent sometimes

486.56 --> 490.4
but anyway yeah the nice and sunny day

488.56 --> 492.479
is really helping

490.4 --> 493.919
me being able to get in my white shirt

492.479 --> 496.71999999999997
again

493.919 --> 496.71999999999997
i missed that

498.8 --> 502.639
hello gabrielle donato

504.84 --> 512.319
nordic

507.52 --> 512.319
oh wow so creative

519.44 --> 524.0
hello foul on buchanan oh yeah turret

521.919 --> 527.1999999999999
306 of course

524.0 --> 527.2
nice title yeah yeah

527.839 --> 533.6800000000001
that's a whole it i got a whole meme

531.6 --> 537.2
store ready with this sort of [ __ ]

533.68 --> 538.16
you know it's weird i do this all the

537.2 --> 541.6800000000001
time i don't

538.16 --> 543.92
even think about it anymore

541.68 --> 545.3599999999999
that i'm really good at that it's not

543.92 --> 549.12
something i have to focus

545.36 --> 551.76
it's like it just happens i just get

549.12 --> 552.64
mimi i just put the sentences together i

551.76 --> 554.72
just

552.64 --> 557.12
get exactly out of it what's supposed to

554.72 --> 557.12
be there

557.279 --> 562.48
and it's so automated i don't even

559.36 --> 563.76
freaking see it as a skill i see it more

562.48 --> 566.399
like a side effect

563.76 --> 567.76
like i can't help that [ __ ] but that

566.399 --> 577.839
also

567.76 --> 577.8389999999999
doesn't make me focus on it very awarely

579.04 --> 590.0
now look dude you can just go [ __ ] off

583.6 --> 593.36
you troll pieces of [ __ ] [ __ ] off

590.0 --> 596.64
i mean it it's nothing for you here

593.36 --> 599.279
this is not about you

596.64 --> 599.68
this is not about your inability to deal

599.279 --> 602.72
with

599.68 --> 604.399
people that just don't accept your

602.72 --> 608.0790000000001
garbage conditioning

604.399 --> 611.36
yeah this is not for you

608.079 --> 613.04
get the [ __ ] out go somewhere else go to

611.36 --> 614.48
a squirter room where they're whining

613.04 --> 616.0
and complaining all day about how

614.48 --> 619.04
everything is wrong because people are

616.0 --> 633.8389999999999
too stupid to believe the conditioning

619.04 --> 633.8389999999999
[ __ ] off

638.56 --> 642.56
i mean jeff's i don't know what jeff

i didn't really get involved too much

680.64 --> 683.8389999999999
not surprisingly

681.839 --> 687.12

933.279 --> 938.079
up

934.959 --> 938.079
you're getting stared

938.639 --> 944.32
in the pot chat trolls

942.32 --> 946.8000000000001
you don't even know how much of a person

944.32 --> 946.8000000000001
they are

952.88 --> 956.48
it worries me sometimes dude it really

955.68 --> 958.88
does

956.48 --> 959.759
and you're not even the worst of them

958.88 --> 969.4399999999999
people that

959.759 --> 972.48
do that it's like

969.44 --> 975.9200000000001
like on the long run the only thing

972.48 --> 979.839
it does the only thing it does to you

975.92 --> 979.8389999999999
it makes you less empathetic

980.399 --> 987.36
and just you stop holding back

984.32 --> 988.32
including when you absolutely should be

987.36 --> 991.44
holding back

988.32 --> 994.8000000000001
right that's what it does to you

991.44 --> 999.12
when you constantly engage

994.8 --> 999.12
and wrestle with chat trolls

999.839 --> 1006.639
they take things away from you

1003.199 --> 1010.959
do you understand so that eventually

1006.639 --> 1014.48
you end up completely out of control

1010.959 --> 1018.56
responding in ways to people that you

1014.48 --> 1022.0
shouldn't because you got used to it

1018.56 --> 1025.839
do you understand this is a serious

1022.0 --> 1025.839
warning to you guys

1042.48 --> 1046.959
if you say yeah i say so and it is

1050.84 --> 1054.799
happening

1052.48 --> 1055.919
i'm seeing others over the flatter

1054.799 --> 1061.039
debate in chat

1055.919 --> 1061.039
that are just completely out of control

1061.36 --> 1065.6789999999999
and then when you actually address them

1063.76 --> 1069.2
onto it

1065.679 --> 1069.2
they are offended

1069.44 --> 1077.2
like how dare you try to make me

1073.84 --> 1079.36
behave like a normal human being in that

1077.2 --> 1082.16
moment how dare you

1079.36 --> 1084.7199999999998
okay this is not a good sign this is not

1082.16 --> 1087.8400000000001
good for you

1084.72 --> 1088.559
you have to find another way this is not

1087.84 --> 1090.6399999999999
healthy

1088.559 --> 1092.48
it's not it's not going to go in towards

1090.64 --> 1095.2800000000002
a good place

1092.48 --> 1097.76
i'm worried about it and i have been for

1095.28 --> 1097.76
a while

1097.919 --> 1102.4
because it's not stopping like even as i

1101.36 --> 1106.0
try to do

1102.4 --> 1109.8400000000001
my thing in chat have you noticed

1106.0 --> 1109.84
i do it a very different way

1110.32 --> 1114.96
right not getting in these stupid

1112.96 --> 1117.44
dogfights always like oh

1114.96 --> 1118.32
i'm more of a smart ass to you i'm more

1117.44 --> 1123.8400000000001
of a smart it's

1118.32 --> 1127.4399999999998
so petty it's so petty

1123.84 --> 1137.84
stop it makes you look really

1127.44 --> 1137.8400000000001
stupid and petty

1138.72 --> 1142.4
and i don't want that because i know you

1140.88 --> 1144.48
got good stuff

1142.4 --> 1146.16
in you you got good insight you got

1144.48 --> 1150.4
skills

1146.16 --> 1154.559
don't let them drag you to that place

1150.4 --> 1157.3600000000001
when you feel it let it go

1154.559 --> 1157.76
don't let them drag you to that place

1157.36 --> 1160.7199999999998
it's

1157.76 --> 1162.32
really bad for you and it's gonna leave

1160.72 --> 1165.52
a mark

1162.32 --> 1168.559
over time it's gonna erode that mark

1165.52 --> 1172.08
in in you and then one day

1168.559 --> 1172.08
you'll never get it off again

1172.16 --> 1179.8400000000001
and i mean like never get it off

1190.84 --> 1193.84
right

1215.84 --> 1221.84
right so now that that is out now that i

1219.36 --> 1221.84
said it

1222.24 --> 1225.1200000000001
you can move on

1225.52 --> 1229.52
not gonna grill you over that like an

1227.52 --> 1232.0
entire show it's just that

1229.52 --> 1234.6399999999999
it's not just you tarik no you're

1232.0 --> 1236.799
actually a pretty cool guy but i do see

1234.64 --> 1249.8400000000001
you get caught up in this [ __ ] and not

1236.799 --> 1249.84
pull other people back and you should

1255.44 --> 1263.8400000000001
i don't know what that means dr gonzo

1280.799 --> 1291.84
all right

1292.0 --> 1299.28
so i'm not i'm not hitting any snares

1295.52 --> 1302.96
i'm not getting any feedback from you

1299.28 --> 1304.0
about this terra 306 am i just being a

1302.96 --> 1306.799
stick in the mud now

1304.0 --> 1308.48
is it all just fine and you can do

1306.799 --> 1311.6
anything you like it's

1308.48 --> 1314.799
totally free you can let your behavior

1311.6 --> 1316.8799999999999
go in any direction

1314.799 --> 1319.84
is that what i am am i sticking the mud

1316.88 --> 1319.8400000000001
right here

1327.2 --> 1333.8400000000001
hello julia pavin

1344.64 --> 1361.8400000000001
okay dr gonzo okay

1375.12 --> 1389.84
hello rich g from sc

1379.039 --> 1389.84
welcome to my chat

1404.08 --> 1408.32
right yeah by the way that title is just

1411.679 --> 1415.919
i don't know it's just a random title i

1413.76 --> 1419.039
i wasn't really planning to talk about

1415.919 --> 1422.3200000000002
coriolis effect or anything

1419.039 --> 1422.32
i could i guess

1426.4 --> 1433.6000000000001
it's just that yeah it's

1430.24 --> 1433.6
all the coriolis talk

1434.96 --> 1445.8400000000001
like what else could be said about it

1470.84 --> 1475.6
and

1473.279 --> 1479.039
all right oh yeah i was watching some

1475.6 --> 1479.039
quantum of conscious video

1479.44 --> 1483.2
before the show as well that was pretty

1481.279 --> 1486.32
good

1483.2 --> 1488.96
it was interesting it really did make me

1486.32 --> 1488.96
think a lot

1490.4 --> 1501.8400000000001
sometimes he's very good at that

1510.32 --> 1515.9189999999999
oh oh x y z

1513.44 --> 1517.919
why celestial sightings an angular

1515.919 --> 1519.76
difference

1517.919 --> 1523.44
well because there's an angular

1519.76 --> 1529.44
difference that is persistent

1523.44 --> 1531.44
over the confirmed flat plane

1529.44 --> 1533.1200000000001
yeah it is a good question it's a great

1531.44 --> 1536.0
question

1533.12 --> 1539.039
yeah why do is the angular sightings of

1536.0 --> 1543.36
the globe of the heavens

1539.039 --> 1546.4
it is visually there only

1543.36 --> 1548.3999999999999
why is it at a different angle

1546.4 --> 1551.44
yeah because it's at a different angle

1548.4 --> 1554.24
over the confirmed

1551.44 --> 1556.799
flat plane that does not have a

1554.24 --> 1560.72
geometric horizon

1556.799 --> 1560.72
why why that's why

1569.52 --> 1577.44
what is the sun right

1573.12 --> 1577.4399999999998
well the sun's just a side effect

1579.76 --> 1583.679
it's the side effect of the light coming

1581.919 --> 1585.8400000000001
from that direction in relation to the

1583.679 --> 1585.8400000000001
observer

1586.96 --> 1594.08
it's not a thing in a

1590.24 --> 1597.44
euclidean literal position

1594.08 --> 1601.9189999999999
that like a lamp is shining light off of

1597.44 --> 1601.919
it that's not the case

1602.32 --> 1605.6
it's more like a light is coming from

1604.4 --> 1608.96
that direction

1605.6 --> 1612.8799999999999
if you follow that path then the path

1608.96 --> 1615.279
changes and it doesn't really

1612.88 --> 1616.159
there is no source point there's no

1615.279 --> 1618.88
light coming

1616.159 --> 1621.0390000000002
from there it's only coming from that

1618.88 --> 1624.4
direction

1621.039 --> 1626.0
and as a secondary effect and i think

1624.4 --> 1627.44
that this works like that with all the

1626.0 --> 1630.64
heavenly bodies

1627.44 --> 1634.0
that we see the discs

1630.64 --> 1637.2
like a little hologram signature

1634.0 --> 1638.0
of the light of that specific type of

1637.2 --> 1641.44
light

1638.0 --> 1644.64
coming from that angle

1641.44 --> 1647.8400000000001
so the discs the sights

1644.64 --> 1649.76
the sun the moon even are side effects

1647.84 --> 1652.08
they're like side effects of looking

1649.76 --> 1654.0
towards that light

1652.08 --> 1656.96
it's not the source of the light it's a

1654.0 --> 1656.96
side effect of it

1657.6 --> 1669.84
that's how i've learned to see it now

1680.88 --> 1683.8400000000001
oh

1685.6 --> 1689.4399999999998
yeah why are you asking the same

1687.6 --> 1691.76
question again

1689.44 --> 1693.039
why is it the same angle when the sun

1691.76 --> 1696.559
sets at

1693.039 --> 1701.039
other positions on the flat

1696.559 --> 1703.84
earth with no geometric horizon

1701.039 --> 1704.559
yeah i know isn't it fascinating how how

1703.84 --> 1707.9189999999999
that all

1704.559 --> 1710.96
fits how these

1707.919 --> 1713.039
celestial lights basically orientate

1710.96 --> 1714.0
themselves in relation to the position

1713.039 --> 1717.279
on earth

1714.0 --> 1717.279
yeah it is fascinating

1718.48 --> 1721.1200000000001
and that's it

1723.52 --> 1726.559
there's nothing else to it it doesn't

1725.36 --> 1729.039
prove it's a globe

1726.559 --> 1731.44
because the earth is flat there is no

1729.039 --> 1736.64
geometric horizon

1731.44 --> 1736.64
there's no sphere it's all flat

1737.679 --> 1742.799
oh hey amanda you what you gave me a

1741.12 --> 1745.4399999999998
shout out when did that happen i

1742.799 --> 1745.44
didn't hear that

1746.72 --> 1754.72
where did you give me a shout out

1752.48 --> 1754.72
all right

1760.559 --> 1767.84
wait i think that was i almost forgot

1762.799 --> 1767.84
this i was on 24 7 discord too yesterday

1770.96 --> 1774.72
like really deep moments for

1775.12 --> 1781.84
for just like 15 minutes and then i kind

1777.84 --> 1781.84
of dropped again

1784.0 --> 1789.44
yeah on nathan show

1792.84 --> 1809.84
wait you were in the discord

1796.88 --> 1809.8400000000001
you actually came on the show

1820.84 --> 1824.9599999999998
oh

1822.96 --> 1828.48
steamy traveler boo that's a big

1824.96 --> 1828.48
question i i don't know

1828.559 --> 1837.84
i don't know enough about it

1851.76 --> 1856.72
hmm to be fair i didn't even know they

1853.919 --> 1865.8400000000001
had underground buildings and all that

1856.72 --> 1865.84
so i don't know why

1875.519 --> 1879.44
oh i was away from the mic yet that

1878.64 --> 1882.7990000000002
could be

1879.44 --> 1882.799
as i said i've been

1882.88 --> 1890.88
not very present yesterday i was

1886.159 --> 1892.88
yeah doing other things

1890.88 --> 1894.0800000000002
because i didn't feel all that great but

1892.88 --> 1896.64
thanks for the shout out

1894.08 --> 1907.84
i didn't know that it happened thanks so

1896.64 --> 1907.8400000000001
many young

1918.84 --> 1921.84
hmm

1928.799 --> 1933.679
i'll be sure to listen back when when

1931.679 --> 1949.8400000000001
the premiere

1933.679 --> 1949.8400000000001
is live thanks for the shout out

1974.84 --> 1977.84
hmm

1997.44 --> 2005.8400000000001
what the hell

2030.08 --> 2034.48
oh he did no i definitely did not pick

2032.64 --> 2047.8400000000001
up on that

2034.48 --> 2047.84
man i completely missed that i'm sorry

2050.8 --> 2061.8390000000004
thank you for the super chat by the way

2052.72 --> 2061.839
again amanda young thank you very much

2064.079 --> 2072.8390000000004
yeah i was an archaeologist what

2068.32 --> 2075.839
oh is that because what

2072.839 --> 2075.839
why

2075.919 --> 2080.96
why did i think i was an archaeologist

2078.72 --> 2084.399
is it because i just happened to know

2080.96 --> 2084.399
a couple of things about it

2084.8 --> 2089.8390000000004
just a few

2093.28 --> 2097.92
and i don't know i do have my ideas

2095.44 --> 2100.8
about the the pyramids and how they were

2097.92 --> 2105.04
constructed and all that

2100.8 --> 2108.0
but an archaeologist seems a little

2105.04 --> 2117.839
specific i i don't know where somebody

2108.0 --> 2117.839
would get that that i'm an archaeologist

2124.64 --> 2131.839
yeah dr gonzo yes they are

2127.839 --> 2131.839
yes they are

2154.48 --> 2163.52
wait they're arguing

2159.599 --> 2167.04
oh i think you're a troll

2163.52 --> 2169.44
are you that same troll that did that

2167.04 --> 2169.44
before

2171.119 --> 2174.2400000000002
sounds like [ __ ]

2177.04 --> 2181.2799999999997
like this is not the first this is like

2178.64 --> 2182.72
the third time some random person comes

2181.28 --> 2185.92
to my chat tells me

2182.72 --> 2188.24
oh look they're talking about arwen oh

2185.92 --> 2191.599
look they're getting in a fight

2188.24 --> 2194.0789999999997
oh look you're banned now

2191.599 --> 2194.079
oh look

2195.28 --> 2201.8390000000004
yeah don't play those shitty games with

2197.44 --> 2201.839
me dude

2230.599 --> 2235.6800000000003
radioactivity which radioactivity

2233.2 --> 2235.68
exactly

2239.68 --> 2244.16
i think radioactivity is something

2246.0 --> 2252.56
is it however as

2249.2 --> 2256.3199999999997
terrible as it's been laid out to be

2252.56 --> 2260.0
in all those ways

2256.32 --> 2261.04
i don't think so could be extremely

2260.0 --> 2262.88
dangerous though

2261.04 --> 2271.839
especially if you're in a really bad

2262.88 --> 2271.839
place in your mind

2305.599 --> 2310.88
uh well dr gonzo was it a hoax no i

2308.88 --> 2316.079
don't think so

2310.88 --> 2316.079
but it's a thriving place right now

2316.32 --> 2322.96
with like incredible wildlife and people

2319.44 --> 2325.44
living there like they were living there

2322.96 --> 2326.48
before the accident and they're still

2325.44 --> 2329.92
living there

2326.48 --> 2332.88
right now yeah

2329.92 --> 2333.92
so whatever you've been told about oh

2332.88 --> 2337.359
god

2333.92 --> 2339.28
radio active fallout and now

2337.359 --> 2341.2
everything is poison everything's gonna

2339.28 --> 2344.6400000000003
die yeah that's been

2341.2 --> 2347.7599999999998
damn well proven to be an absolute farce

2344.64 --> 2351.2799999999997
yeah that's not

2347.76 --> 2353.44
what happened oh it's a closed up so

2351.28 --> 2355.44
yeah except there's still people living

2353.44 --> 2357.04
there and there's freaking festivals and

2355.44 --> 2359.52
there's like a thriving

2357.04 --> 2362.96
natural scene there oh you've been there

2359.52 --> 2366.839
oh dude get the [ __ ] out of here dude

2497.839 --> 2503.839
i don't give a [ __ ] if he acquires

i'm not doing it for him i don't give a

2506.96 --> 2512.0
[ __ ] you people

2508.64 --> 2515.52
yeah you specific people that do that

2512.0 --> 2517.2
[ __ ] that stroll around with flat

2515.52 --> 2518.0
earthers trying to make our lives

2517.2 --> 2520.7999999999997
miserable

2518.0 --> 2523.359
you scumbags need to get the [ __ ] out of

2520.8 --> 2526.2400000000002
this world

2523.359 --> 2526.24
get a life

2526.72 --> 2532.7999999999997
[ __ ] get a [ __ ] life

2530.0 --> 2533.839
and leave us alone with your sick

2532.8 --> 2537.599
manipulative

2533.839 --> 2539.44
[ __ ] get a [ __ ] life or get the [ __ ]

2537.599 --> 2543.92
out

2539.44 --> 2547.2000000000003
done with you and your stupid fake

2543.92 --> 2551.839
gaslighting doctor acts

2547.2 --> 2551.839
[ __ ] you

2578.56 --> 2585.119
no ladies painted clock hands right so

2583.28 --> 2586.4
does that mean that they actually got

2585.119 --> 2589.52
into contact

2586.4 --> 2590.8
with the paint that would make sense you

2589.52 --> 2594.4
know

2590.8 --> 2597.119
those materials being technically

2594.4 --> 2597.119
poisonous

2604.839 --> 2607.839
right

2607.92 --> 2613.76
look nuclear bombs

2611.04 --> 2615.52
might be fake because nuclear fission

2613.76 --> 2617.5200000000004
isn't technically possible

2615.52 --> 2620.56
it's science fiction they rammed it

2617.52 --> 2622.96
through in the whole package

2620.56 --> 2624.24
doesn't mean that radioactivity like

2622.96 --> 2627.599
like there is no

2624.24 --> 2630.7999999999997
thing like that no there is it's just

2627.599 --> 2633.6800000000003
not what they told us it was

2630.8 --> 2635.6800000000003
everything about it is different there

2633.68 --> 2637.839
are effects and there is definitely a

2635.68 --> 2641.1189999999997
poison factor to it

2637.839 --> 2643.04
but there's i might my belief in what i

2641.119 --> 2647.44
figured out so far there's a big

2643.04 --> 2651.44
psychosomatic component to it big

2647.44 --> 2654.56
like spirit matters

2651.44 --> 2654.56
when you're confronted with

2660.839 --> 2663.839
radioactivity

2664.0 --> 2671.68
oh oh xyz you mean the the testing

2668.319 --> 2673.44
footage of the nuclear bomb explosions

2671.68 --> 2675.2799999999997
where everything including brick

2673.44 --> 2678.319
buildings is swept away

2675.28 --> 2681.2000000000003
but the camera is fully intact

2678.319 --> 2683.839
not being absolutely demolished

2681.2 --> 2688.0789999999997
pulverized by the shockwave

2683.839 --> 2688.0789999999997
those nuclear footages you mean

2689.52 --> 2693.119
yeah sure

2694.24 --> 2697.4399999999996
you think that's real

2697.52 --> 2705.839
and i got a moon landing to sell you

2708.079 --> 2712.0
do i doubt nuclear power plants no i

2710.4 --> 2714.48
don't

2712.0 --> 2715.28
i think nuclear power plants are real i

2714.48 --> 2717.04
never said

2715.28 --> 2719.599
radioactivity is not real and that

2717.04 --> 2722.8
radioactive material is not real

2719.599 --> 2724.56
yes they are absolutely there is such

2722.8 --> 2727.92
things

2724.56 --> 2727.92
and it does do something

2729.359 --> 2735.2
yeah nukes are fake yeah that's right no

2732.8 --> 2736.88
nuclear bombs all science fiction

2735.2 --> 2739.2799999999997
there's big bombs though

2736.88 --> 2740.8
you know just because there are no nukes

2739.28 --> 2742.6400000000003
doesn't mean that

2740.8 --> 2744.7200000000003
the world could not technically be

2742.64 --> 2748.0
completely

2744.72 --> 2751.04
just destroyed through cratering right

2748.0 --> 2755.28
not saying that's not possible

2751.04 --> 2761.839
just saying there's no nuclear bombs

2755.28 --> 2761.8390000000004
that's not how it works

2783.359 --> 2787.2799999999997
well why don't you tell it to them and

2786.0 --> 2790.48
they'll tell you

2787.28 --> 2793.2000000000003
they'll tell you what happened

2790.48 --> 2794.4
yeah they'll tell you the oldest ones

2793.2 --> 2797.52
that

2794.4 --> 2799.359
are not like super cocked

2797.52 --> 2801.839
they'll tell yeah they just fire bomb

2799.359 --> 2804.88
the [ __ ] out of him

2801.839 --> 2808.16
and it was horrible

2804.88 --> 2810.96
there's no nuclear explosion it just

2808.16 --> 2817.839
firebombed them

2810.96 --> 2817.839
yeah and it's pretty damn terrible

2851.04 --> 2857.44
right i think that nuclear power is like

2854.4 --> 2860.599
really easy i think that

2857.44 --> 2864.8
nuclear power plant system is so

2860.599 --> 2868.0
unbelievably efficient and easy

2864.8 --> 2870.48
that they literally made this giant

2868.0 --> 2874.0
[ __ ] up story surrounding it

2870.48 --> 2877.359
purely to gain control through

2874.0 --> 2880.4
evil and fear and mind control

2877.359 --> 2883.68
just to monopolize on it

2880.4 --> 2887.2000000000003
to make it a dangerous thing virtually

2883.68 --> 2890.96
to everybody to make it a threat

2887.2 --> 2894.96
in order to be some kind of agency grip

2890.96 --> 2898.2400000000002
on the entire thing worldwide to claim

2894.96 --> 2900.319
to be protectors whatever they made it

2898.24 --> 2904.72
into a giant threat

2900.319 --> 2910.319
when it was probably the most efficient

2904.72 --> 2910.319
energy source discovered up until that

2912.839 --> 2919.839
time that's why i think they did it

2915.839 --> 2922.0789999999997
because it was too good it was too free

2919.839 --> 2924.24
it's the same shitty story as what

2922.079 --> 2927.28
happened with

2924.24 --> 2928.8799999999997
with the hydrogen cars and the cars on

2927.28 --> 2932.1600000000003
water and [ __ ] it's that

2928.88 --> 2935.359
it's like nuclear power it was too easy

2932.16 --> 2937.359
it was too efficient they had to make it

2935.359 --> 2939.839
dangerous they had to make it poisonous

2937.359 --> 2942.0
they had to make it restricted

2939.839 --> 2945.04
otherwise everybody would just have

2942.0 --> 2945.04
unlimited power

2946.16 --> 2952.0789999999997
right radium heaters and they just

2949.2 --> 2953.2799999999997
didn't want the people to have that

2952.079 --> 2955.119
availability

2953.28 --> 2956.6400000000003
they didn't want the people to have it

2955.119 --> 2960.1600000000003
so they literally

2956.64 --> 2962.319
made a giant science fiction story

2960.16 --> 2965.92
to make it into extremely dangerous

2962.319 --> 2965.92
substances and all that and

2966.559 --> 2973.0400000000004
and then completely monopolize on it

2970.64 --> 2985.839
so that the general public would never

2973.04 --> 2985.839
again get a grip on that

2988.64 --> 2999.839
that's what i think they did

3025.28 --> 3030.6400000000003
more colored there would like those

3028.319 --> 3033.2
cities would not be cities

3030.64 --> 3034.16
they would it wouldn't have been rebuilt

3033.2 --> 3037.5989999999997
there would be no

3034.16 --> 3041.839
city there right now if if things were

3037.599 --> 3041.839
as the story is told

3066.839 --> 3069.839
right

3070.96 --> 3075.44
no clear bombs were first are you

3073.76 --> 3078.559
kidding me

3075.44 --> 3080.7200000000003
are you freaking kidding me that's total

3078.559 --> 3083.8390000000004
nonsense

3080.72 --> 3083.839
that's nonsense

3090.64 --> 3094.16
like this substance was already being

3093.44 --> 3098.8
used

3094.16 --> 3098.7999999999997
way before nuclear bombs became a thing

3101.599 --> 3111.839
that's just nonsense

3133.04 --> 3136.96
you check it for you oh you mean look it

3135.76 --> 3142.4
up

3136.96 --> 3142.4
look it up on wikipedia oh goody

3143.119 --> 3148.4
yeah no it makes no sense it makes no

3146.24 --> 3149.1189999999997
logical sense why don't you think about

3148.4 --> 3151.839
it

3149.119 --> 3152.559
yeah i don't have to look it up to

3151.839 --> 3156.5589999999997
realize

3152.559 --> 3160.559
that that makes no damn sense

3156.559 --> 3163.0400000000004
nuclear bombs first and then

3160.559 --> 3165.2000000000003
another way of actually using the

3163.04 --> 3166.88
material in some kind of mechanical

3165.2 --> 3170.48
setup like

3166.88 --> 3172.2400000000002
that makes no sense at all

3170.48 --> 3174.16
you think that material was just

3172.24 --> 3176.16
discovered out of nowhere

3174.16 --> 3177.68
and oh let's make a nuclear bomb out of

3176.16 --> 3180.8799999999997
it oh oh wait

3177.68 --> 3184.16
we could also make reactors out of it

3180.88 --> 3186.2400000000002
yeah that makes so much [ __ ] sense

3184.16 --> 3188.0
that's really how the things are done in

3186.24 --> 3191.7599999999998
the world

3188.0 --> 3194.8
no no that material was known

3191.76 --> 3197.8390000000004
and used

3194.8 --> 3200.88
on an industrial level

3197.839 --> 3200.88
for a long time

3202.16 --> 3206.3999999999996
way before freaking nuclear bombs

3204.8 --> 3209.44
supposedly arrive

3206.4 --> 3213.04
it's absolutely preposterous do you have

3209.44 --> 3215.68
no critical thinking left

3213.04 --> 3219.2799999999997
why don't you do your own research

3215.68 --> 3219.2799999999997
instead of being a wiki parrot

3220.48 --> 3237.839
what you think about it

3244.72 --> 3250.0789999999997
like i don't have to look it up to know

3247.28 --> 3255.44
that that makes no damn sense

3250.079 --> 3255.44
why why don't you see it

3260.319 --> 3265.119
like i lit you i i'm not gonna look it

3262.8 --> 3268.559
up i'm not gonna google it

3265.119 --> 3273.04
it makes no sense it makes

3268.559 --> 3273.0400000000004
no sense like that it just doesn't

3275.599 --> 3278.88
nuclear bombs first and then nuclear

3278.079 --> 3282.88
power plants

3278.88 --> 3285.119
yeah sure makes no sense

3282.88 --> 3286.1600000000003
yeah and i do know that they typically

3285.119 --> 3288.7200000000003
like to

3286.16 --> 3290.24
roll out the history chart in computer

3288.72 --> 3292.8799999999997
games like that as well

3290.24 --> 3294.72
and guess what in computer games it also

3292.88 --> 3297.92
makes no damn sense

3294.72 --> 3300.72
yeah i know some of my favorite games do

3297.92 --> 3303.839
that [ __ ] and it makes no damn sense

3300.72 --> 3307.04
what can you do about it nothing

3303.839 --> 3310.0789999999997
just play the game and remember

3307.04 --> 3313.119
it makes no damn sense don't let it be

3310.079 --> 3314.96
normalized don't let it overwrite your

3313.119 --> 3317.2000000000003
critical thinking ability

3314.96 --> 3319.119
that it makes no damn sense that it

3317.2 --> 3335.839
would happen in that order

3319.119 --> 3335.839
absolutely none

3338.799 --> 3341.44
no it doesn't

3344.079 --> 3348.1600000000003
maintaining a stable reactor is much

3346.72 --> 3351.359
riskier oh my

3348.16 --> 3354.8799999999997
god that's so stupid

3351.359 --> 3354.88
that's total nonsense

3360.319 --> 3364.5589999999997
seriously it makes no sense how would

3363.44 --> 3369.119
you even come up

3364.559 --> 3372.3190000000004
with the idea of creating a unique

3369.119 --> 3375.6800000000003
fusion reaction with a material

3372.319 --> 3376.5589999999997
that material has been around since

3375.68 --> 3380.0789999999997
antiquity

3376.559 --> 3383.28
since forever it was there

3380.079 --> 3385.76
can be used metal metallurgy

3383.28 --> 3386.559
has been around for a very long time you

3385.76 --> 3388.8390000000004
think that

3386.559 --> 3390.2400000000002
hasn't been utilized hasn't been

3388.839 --> 3393.7599999999998
isolated

3390.24 --> 3394.9599999999996
through the chemists alone makes no

3393.76 --> 3398.48
sense

3394.96 --> 3399.839
of course they knew radioactive

3398.48 --> 3402.16
materials

3399.839 --> 3404.16
before the freaking nuclear bomb of

3402.16 --> 3408.16
course they did makes no sense

3404.16 --> 3410.799
sense if they didn't none at all

3408.16 --> 3411.44
like even if they didn't understand why

3410.799 --> 3413.599
it did

3411.44 --> 3414.96
the things that it did they would have

3413.599 --> 3419.3590000000004
still figured out a

3414.96 --> 3422.319
way to use it of course they would

3419.359 --> 3422.64
makes no sense if they wouldn't it's

3422.319 --> 3426.4
like

3422.64 --> 3429.2799999999997
discovering fire not knowing why

3426.4 --> 3429.839
something burns and that it creates fire

3429.28 --> 3432.1600000000003
and then

3429.839 --> 3433.7599999999998
not using it even though you don't

3432.16 --> 3436.72
understand of course you're gonna

3433.76 --> 3437.599
[ __ ] try it out what can you do with

3436.72 --> 3439.9199999999996
this

3437.599 --> 3440.7200000000003
who gives a [ __ ] what causes it it's

3439.92 --> 3442.88
something

3440.72 --> 3444.72
what can you do with it it's human

3442.88 --> 3447.839
nature

3444.72 --> 3447.839
oh my god

3449.52 --> 3460.39
dude get the [ __ ] out of here you

3451.359 --> 3463.48
[ __ ] [ __ ]

3460.39 --> 3463.48
[Applause]

3468.4 --> 3471.599
i can't believe i i really have to say

3470.88 --> 3475.839
this stuff

3471.599 --> 3475.839
i can't believe it

3492.559 --> 3496.48
all right making a steam plant is much

3495.359 --> 3499.52
easier than a

3496.48 --> 3503.359
nuke of course it is and

3499.52 --> 3506.079
hey a nuke is supposedly a special

3503.359 --> 3506.72
critical mass reaction that doesn't

3506.079 --> 3509.599
happen

3506.72 --> 3511.2799999999997
how they would have to theoretically

3509.599 --> 3515.44
figure that out first

3511.28 --> 3517.2000000000003
well the actual just passive effects of

3515.44 --> 3520.4
the material

3517.2 --> 3524.0
it's present there at all times

3520.4 --> 3525.28
why wouldn't they utilize it the effect

3524.0 --> 3527.52
that is literally

3525.28 --> 3529.599
measurable at all times it makes no

3527.52 --> 3532.079
sense of course they did something with

3529.599 --> 3534.0
it first

3532.079 --> 3536.319
and now i'm even falling for this

3534.0 --> 3539.839
paradigm because there are no nukes it's

3536.319 --> 3543.119
science fiction that never happened

3539.839 --> 3545.44
they made it up to monopolize

3543.119 --> 3549.28
on the material and to ensure that

3545.44 --> 3549.28
people can't do anything with it

3550.799 --> 3556.88
because they were doing things

3553.92 --> 3558.319
with it in the century before that i'm

3556.88 --> 3561.44
pretty sure they were

3558.319 --> 3564.48
on an industrialized scale radium

3561.44 --> 3564.48
heaters everywhere

3567.119 --> 3573.839
come on

3598.72 --> 3605.1189999999997
right okay okay

3602.24 --> 3607.1189999999997
you knows maybe that's the first nuclear

3605.119 --> 3608.799
reactor that's been specifically

3607.119 --> 3612.48
utilized to create

3608.799 --> 3616.0
electricity you know that could be

3612.48 --> 3617.76
yeah it's not the only way you can use

3616.0 --> 3621.44
that type of material though

3617.76 --> 3626.079
right so yes maybe the first

3621.44 --> 3630.48
nuclear electricity power plant

3626.079 --> 3632.559
was like during that time period

3630.48 --> 3634.4
before that they still use it as a

3632.559 --> 3643.8390000000004
heater

3634.4 --> 3643.839
because it's just a passive thing

3665.52 --> 3670.0
god i'm so sick of these people [ __ ]

3668.72 --> 3673.2
xyz doctor

3670.0 --> 3676.24
gunzo you're all pieces of [ __ ]

3673.2 --> 3678.8799999999997
you're pieces of [ __ ] propagandists

3676.24 --> 3680.9599999999996
and you're [ __ ] i bet these [ __ ]

3678.88 --> 3685.52
are paid for this [ __ ]

3680.96 --> 3688.7200000000003
to get around and correct misinformation

3685.52 --> 3689.52
yeah who's paying you for that freaking

3688.72 --> 3694.48
google

3689.52 --> 3699.28
zuckerberg who the [ __ ] why are you here

3694.48 --> 3701.76
getting in the way reinforcing old [ __ ]

3699.28 --> 3702.559
that's being tested i'm so sick of these

3701.76 --> 3705.0400000000004
people

3702.559 --> 3706.079
you know if you're just a random guy or

3705.04 --> 3708.319
whatever or girl

3706.079 --> 3709.44
on the internet and you're like what the

3708.319 --> 3712.48
[ __ ] is this

3709.44 --> 3713.599
what nukes don't exist yeah i get it i

3712.48 --> 3717.039
get it of course

3713.599 --> 3718.559
it's weird it's like what yeah

3717.039 --> 3720.3190000000004
but if you're just going to keep

3718.559 --> 3723.039
doubling down forever

3720.319 --> 3724.88
when you're supposedly educated and

3723.039 --> 3727.76
you're actually being tested

3724.88 --> 3729.599
on the details of what you thought was

3727.76 --> 3731.5200000000004
true what you took for granted

3729.599 --> 3734.2400000000002
and then you keep doubling down and

3731.52 --> 3736.88
gaslighting and ridiculing afterwards

3734.24 --> 3739.1189999999997
then what what the [ __ ] is wrong with

3736.88 --> 3739.119
you

3739.839 --> 3743.68
some serious [ __ ] yeah you get the hell

3742.559 --> 3748.0
out of here too you

3743.68 --> 3748.0
freaking disgusting ugh

3752.0 --> 3755.839
get out

3759.359 --> 3763.359
otherwise it's just people gonna go

3760.799 --> 3769.839
squirting again

3763.359 --> 3769.839
just no you're not getting in here

3781.92 --> 3787.76
does a geiger counter detect alpha

3784.079 --> 3787.76
particles i don't think so

3787.839 --> 3794.4
didn't it only detect gamma particles

3791.599 --> 3794.4
supposedly

3794.839 --> 3797.839
god

3798.24 --> 3800.4799999999996
right

3809.76 --> 3813.599
it's been a long time ago since i looked

3811.76 --> 3816.4
into the details of that i did

3813.599 --> 3816.4
dig into it

3817.359 --> 3823.119
it's just that when i dug into it

3820.64 --> 3825.7599999999998
i was still very much anchored in

3823.119 --> 3828.48
history as a cross-reference now i'm

3825.76 --> 3828.48
figuring out

3828.559 --> 3833.6800000000003
like no like there's literally just a

3832.16 --> 3836.5589999999997
conspiracy there there

3833.68 --> 3839.2
it's not a theory it's not a theory it's

3836.559 --> 3843.6800000000003
a conspiracy it's a conspiracy

3839.2 --> 3845.9199999999996
to monopolize on nuclear materials

3843.68 --> 3847.2799999999997
make this giant boogeyman story

3845.92 --> 3849.44
surrounding it

3847.28 --> 3850.4
and then just taking it from the free

3849.44 --> 3853.44
public

3850.4 --> 3854.2400000000002
like you're not allowed to use that do

3853.44 --> 3857.359
you understand

3854.24 --> 3861.4399999999996
you are not allowed to use it why

3857.359 --> 3864.4
because a bunch of creepy [ __ ]

3861.44 --> 3866.44
made this giant hoax about freaking

3864.4 --> 3867.76
nuclear bombs and they're using it in

3866.44 --> 3871.119
geopolitical

3867.76 --> 3872.7200000000003
pressure [ __ ] and all that to scare the

3871.119 --> 3875.119
[ __ ] out of everybody

3872.72 --> 3876.16
and now you can't use that material

3875.119 --> 3879.52
anymore

3876.16 --> 3882.16
you understand it's not a theory it's

3879.52 --> 3882.16
right there

3886.16 --> 3890.48
and none of you have ever freaking seen

3888.0 --> 3895.599
a nuclear explosion ever it's just that

3890.48 --> 3898.4
stupid little fake video

3895.599 --> 3900.4
where everything shatters to dust except

3898.4 --> 3902.7200000000003
the freaking camera itself

3900.4 --> 3902.7200000000003
right

3904.48 --> 3909.839
none of it makes any damn sense

3911.039 --> 3914.88
oh steamy traveler asking tough

3913.52 --> 3916.64
questions

3914.88 --> 3918.559
what's the difference between alpha

3916.64 --> 3921.68
gamma particle there's alpha

3918.559 --> 3925.28
beta gamma particles uh gamma particles

3921.68 --> 3929.44
is like high frequency radiation it is

3925.28 --> 3929.44
like on the super high spectrum of light

3929.92 --> 3936.96
and it penetrates

3934.079 --> 3937.92
further through things that's also why i

3936.96 --> 3940.96
think they use

3937.92 --> 3945.359
something in that on that frequency

3940.96 --> 3945.359
level for what is it

3945.68 --> 3949.5989999999997
for scanning like medical scanning

3948.24 --> 3952.9599999999996
scanning through

3949.599 --> 3956.88
bones and [ __ ] so it's like

3952.96 --> 3956.88
it reaches further through

3957.2 --> 3963.839
it's ionizing or something and then

3960.48 --> 3964.799
the beta particles it penetrates less

3963.839 --> 3968.0789999999997
through

3964.799 --> 3970.319
but like it has a more toxic effect and

3968.079 --> 3972.48
then the alpha

3970.319 --> 3975.359
it's like super superficial but

3972.48 --> 3978.559
extremely toxic

3975.359 --> 3979.5989999999997
like very locally poisoning that that's

3978.559 --> 3982.88
roughly how i

3979.599 --> 3982.88
remembered learning about it

3985.52 --> 3993.839
i always found it kind of confusing

4006.319 --> 4009.599
yeah well seeking star water diamonds

4008.64 --> 4014.4
may not

4009.599 --> 4016.7200000000003
be rare they're not freaking illegal

4014.4 --> 4018.48
how about that this kind of another

4016.72 --> 4021.359
level wouldn't you say

4018.48 --> 4024.079
it's not illegal to have diamonds or to

4021.359 --> 4027.68
make them or to do stuff with them

4024.079 --> 4030.4
you know they're just more expensive

4027.68 --> 4031.5989999999997
you're not gonna get like swat team with

4030.4 --> 4034.559
people

4031.599 --> 4036.7200000000003
in hazmat suits if they find out you

4034.559 --> 4037.599
have some piece of radioactive material

4036.72 --> 4042.48
that's on the

4037.599 --> 4042.48
heavy prohibited list right that's the

4046.839 --> 4049.839
difference

4099.26 --> 4102.459
[Music]

4102.839 --> 4105.839
hmm

4147.12 --> 4154.96
yeah are you sure

4151.279 --> 4155.6
guns i was a nasa well i was a nasa fan

4154.96 --> 4157.759
boy no

4155.6 --> 4157.759
no

4158.88 --> 4163.12
not really like from the start i was

4162.719 --> 4166.0
always

4163.12 --> 4166.64
pissed off at nasa for not doing it

4166.0 --> 4168.4
right

4166.64 --> 4170.719
like from the start that happened like

4168.4 --> 4172.4
when i was freaking six

4170.719 --> 4174.0
it's like the first time immediately

4172.4 --> 4177.04
it's like oh wow this is so

4174.0 --> 4179.839
cool and then like what

4177.04 --> 4181.6
why are you saying something is stupid

4179.839 --> 4184.88
that's wrong why are you doing that

4181.6 --> 4185.6
are you are you testing me and then it

4184.88 --> 4189.839
just

4185.6 --> 4194.0
it turned out to always be that stupid

4189.839 --> 4195.44
so i loved the idea of space and

4194.0 --> 4199.12
everything and

4195.44 --> 4203.839999999999
what could be done the dreaming

4199.12 --> 4203.84
but no nasa always kind of sucked

4204.159 --> 4217.839999999999
in my experience

4241.36 --> 4245.839999999999
i've never used rhodium but i have used

4243.6 --> 4245.84
platinum

4248.08 --> 4259.84
one time

4261.12 --> 4265.92
it's not really my thing though i'm

4264.32 --> 4268.799999999999
really more into the gold

4265.92 --> 4268.8
varieties and

4269.04 --> 4273.84
gold is much nicer

4284.0 --> 4287.84
dammit what the hell

4298.84 --> 4315.84
man

4301.12 --> 4315.84
my arm is really hurting

4349.04 --> 4353.84
they use diamond chips to seat it oh

4351.28 --> 4357.36
that's brilliant

4353.84 --> 4359.360000000001
well that makes perfect sense

4357.36 --> 4360.5599999999995
because what they do with the diamonds

4359.36 --> 4364.5599999999995
is is just the

4360.56 --> 4364.56
high pressure force crystallize it

4364.719 --> 4368.4800000000005
so if you then use a piece of original

4367.52 --> 4371.120000000001
diamond

4368.48 --> 4372.32
and then provide the material then the

4371.12 --> 4375.12
pressure conditions

4372.32 --> 4377.199
like it's just gonna build on top

4375.12 --> 4379.199
crystallized right on top

4377.199 --> 4382.32
of the actual diamond fragment

4379.199 --> 4385.839999999999
crystallize around it

4382.32 --> 4385.84
that makes sense

4390.56 --> 4395.92
no i'm not gonna chat with freaking

4393.28 --> 4399.44
astronomers dude

4395.92 --> 4400.159
like they'll hate me just it's not gonna

4399.44 --> 4404.0
work

4400.159 --> 4407.679
peop astronomers come on

4404.0 --> 4410.84
this is people completely dedicated

4407.679 --> 4413.84
like they're never going to accept

4410.84 --> 4413.84
anything

4428.56 --> 4432.2390000000005
it's yeah but seeking star wars it's not

4430.56 --> 4435.6
just indoctrinated

4432.239 --> 4438.879999999999
they are completely submerged

4435.6 --> 4442.08
and dependent on it

4438.88 --> 4446.08
right it's not just really willful no

4442.08 --> 4446.08
it's completely dependent on it

4448.159 --> 4455.839999999999
you can't get them out

4480.84 --> 4485.92
okay

4482.32 --> 4488.159
is it this no that's astrophys i don't

4485.92 --> 4489.679
are astronomers even supposed to say

4488.159 --> 4494.4
anything

4489.679 --> 4496.96
about it aren't they just observers

4494.4 --> 4500.4
ones that stare at the heaven and then

4496.96 --> 4504.32
relay that information to others

4500.4 --> 4506.4
try to discover new sightings

4504.32 --> 4508.5599999999995
i think it's the astrophysicists that

4506.4 --> 4511.839999999999
really draw the conclusion of how things

4508.56 --> 4511.84
are supposed to happen out there

4527.199 --> 4532.879999999999
did astronomers observing diamonds

4529.6 --> 4532.88
raining on exoplanets

4533.76 --> 4539.4400000000005
i don't think so i think that was

4536.84 --> 4542.96
speculated

4539.44 --> 4544.159
like they would be like okay so we know

4542.96 --> 4547.44
what it looks like

4544.159 --> 4549.759999999999
at a distance now let's imagine

4547.44 --> 4552.0
what is going to be the spectrum of

4549.76 --> 4554.719
materials that are present in under what

4552.0 --> 4556.08
conditions temperatures pressures you

4554.719 --> 4558.08
know and then they just have this

4556.08 --> 4561.04
virtual

4558.08 --> 4562.88
well sandbox you could call it where

4561.04 --> 4563.76
they just speculate okay what's gonna be

4562.88 --> 4565.6
there and then

4563.76 --> 4567.679
somebody at some point comes up with

4565.6 --> 4569.1990000000005
like yeah they might just under the

4567.679 --> 4571.12
pressure conditions and all that there

4569.199 --> 4572.0
might be these diamond charts and then

4571.12 --> 4577.44
everybody's

4572.0 --> 4580.159
oh diamond shards people will like that

4577.44 --> 4582.239
that sound came to freaking diamond

4580.159 --> 4584.799999999999
charts that's the only reason it's like

4582.239 --> 4587.919999999999
somebody just randomly came up with that

4584.8 --> 4589.76
in the sandboxing mind experiment about

4587.92 --> 4591.04
what it what the planet or whatever is

4589.76 --> 4593.1990000000005
like

4591.04 --> 4594.96
and then somebody brought up diamonds

4593.199 --> 4598.96
and then everybody was like oh

4594.96 --> 4602.0
that's a good one people are like that

4598.96 --> 4609.84
that's it that's the only thing

4602.0 --> 4609.84
the only reason why it's there

4636.239 --> 4642.959999999999
right because yeah part of this

4639.36 --> 4644.48
room this dream room of heliocentric

4642.96 --> 4646.56
outer space

4644.48 --> 4647.759999999999
and everything that can be cited at a

4646.56 --> 4650.8
distance or

4647.76 --> 4654.64
is so claimed to be

4650.8 --> 4659.12
more like tea leaf reading in reality

4654.64 --> 4662.0
yeah it's a giant sandbox and

4659.12 --> 4662.88
it can be utilized to appeal to people's

4662.0 --> 4665.6
greed

4662.88 --> 4666.4800000000005
it's like oh look at all these endless

4665.6 --> 4669.4400000000005
treasures

4666.48 --> 4671.759999999999
endless amounts of gold endless amounts

4669.44 --> 4672.719
of diamond and less amounts of this and

4671.76 --> 4676.84
that

4672.719 --> 4678.08
out there oh if only we can develop the

4676.84 --> 4680.32
technology

4678.08 --> 4681.92
pump in a lot of money and stuff and

4680.32 --> 4685.36
give us everything

4681.92 --> 4688.56
then maybe maybe one day

4685.36 --> 4690.48
way after you're dead of course

4688.56 --> 4692.320000000001
we'll be able to get there and actually

4690.48 --> 4695.759999999999
retrieve some of that

4692.32 --> 4698.08
yeah it's part of their scam

4695.76 --> 4700.8
a bigger part it's it's one of the parts

4698.08 --> 4703.12
that actually keeps the financiering

4700.8 --> 4706.400000000001
going

4703.12 --> 4708.96
from the bigger players it's it's just

4706.4 --> 4714.0
as much a trap for industrialists

4708.96 --> 4717.44
that just wants more materials available

4714.0 --> 4720.719
want to take a risk yeah

4717.44 --> 4723.12
you can scam those into

4720.719 --> 4724.2390000000005
make convincing them if you pay us this

4723.12 --> 4728.08
much

4724.239 --> 4730.32
then we might be able to

4728.08 --> 4732.5599999999995
get to this thing and then mine it and

4730.32 --> 4737.199
bring it back and

4732.56 --> 4749.84
yeah and even very very very rich people

4737.199 --> 4749.839999999999
will fall for that [ __ ] they do

4794.159 --> 4799.44
yes yes mark collard i was referring to

4797.28 --> 4801.599999999999
that earlier actually

4799.44 --> 4803.599999999999
the old ladies that do live there even

4801.6 --> 4806.96
since before and they're just

4803.6 --> 4806.96
not going away yeah

4807.28 --> 4819.84
it is pretty awesome

4839.6 --> 4844.84
hey hey long time no see burning

4842.8 --> 4846.0
fat till my stomach is as flat as the

4844.84 --> 4861.84
earth

4846.0 --> 4861.84
good to see you

4872.84 --> 4876.96
hmm

4874.639 --> 4879.6
no but burn fat on stomachs as flat as

4876.96 --> 4882.8
the earth has been subscribed to me

4879.6 --> 4882.8
longer than most of you

4884.159 --> 4892.239
like i remember him even popping in my

4887.84 --> 4894.32
chat during the flat earth talks days so

4892.239 --> 4897.839999999999
yeah there is flutter oh wait no there

4894.32 --> 4903.84
is no flutter's debate that's right

4897.84 --> 4903.84
because it's nathan's wife's birthday

4942.84 --> 4945.84
hmm

4956.84 --> 4959.84
what

4970.84 --> 4973.84
man

4975.52 --> 4987.84
i don't know why my arm just keeps

4979.04 --> 4987.84
nagging me

5005.12 --> 5009.199
does helium go down in a vacuum no it

5007.199 --> 5011.199
goes in all directions but if it is

5009.199 --> 5015.839999999999
contained

5011.199 --> 5015.839999999999
separately then

5016.159 --> 5020.719
its average density combined with the

5019.36 --> 5025.04
container's density

5020.719 --> 5030.08
will be less dense than the very thin

5025.04 --> 5030.08
gas the vacuum that surrounds it

5033.199 --> 5038.32
but yeah if you just if a helium only

5036.639 --> 5039.12
it's just gonna go in all directions

5038.32 --> 5043.84
just like that

5039.12 --> 5043.84
very quickly

5065.679 --> 5070.2390000000005
look up what sudden left arm pain no

5068.08 --> 5072.719
it's not a freaking heart attack that's

5070.239 --> 5075.759999999999
ridiculous

5072.719 --> 5081.84
that's that's like it

5075.76 --> 5081.84
recognizable but my heart is very calm

5083.199 --> 5087.599999999999
it's more like the typical must muscle

5096.84 --> 5099.84
ache

5110.84 --> 5113.84
um

5124.639 --> 5130.2390000000005
all right well batman forever well

5128.0 --> 5131.76
yeah that was actually addressed

5130.239 --> 5134.799999999999
yesterday

5131.76 --> 5135.6
also you know the guys and i talked

5134.8 --> 5139.12
about it

5135.6 --> 5141.360000000001
after the show ended for a long time

5139.12 --> 5143.679
and it really might come down to that it

5141.36 --> 5146.719
is purely because

5143.679 --> 5150.2390000000005
the earth is being heated

5146.719 --> 5153.28
while at the top of the container

5150.239 --> 5156.799999999999
there may be a cooling element

5153.28 --> 5158.639
and that that heat that the temperature

5156.8 --> 5161.92
differential on either sides

5158.639 --> 5168.08
is what truly causes the the gradient

5161.92 --> 5169.76
the gas to form the gradient as it does

5168.08 --> 5172.239
because i think that it has been

5169.76 --> 5173.92
demonstrated to work like that even in

5172.239 --> 5177.199
the small scale

5173.92 --> 5180.2390000000005
again in a pressurized

5177.199 --> 5182.32
transparent tank and if you have a heat

5180.239 --> 5183.678999999999
and a cooling element on either sides of

5182.32 --> 5186.239
the tank

5183.679 --> 5187.04
that any gas you're going to introduce

5186.239 --> 5192.08
into that

5187.04 --> 5192.08
closed system is going to form a

5194.84 --> 5200.400000000001
gradient

5197.199 --> 5203.599999999999
so that might be the only true

5200.4 --> 5205.839999999999
reason might be

5203.6 --> 5206.639
why it is like this why there is a

5205.84 --> 5209.12
gradient

5206.639 --> 5211.84
of gas pressure in the realm the way it

5209.12 --> 5211.84
is

5217.679 --> 5221.28
you may need more potassium

5221.52 --> 5226.2390000000005
okay steamy traveler i i'm gonna test

5224.0 --> 5226.239
that

5227.76 --> 5230.96
it's funny because i had been thinking

5229.6 --> 5234.08
about bananas

5230.96 --> 5235.199
recently when i went through the grocery

5234.08 --> 5238.32
store and all that

5235.199 --> 5240.719
i might try that maybe it'll help thanks

5238.32 --> 5253.84
for the tip

5240.719 --> 5253.84
i haven't eaten bananas in a long time

5264.84 --> 5267.84
um

5272.32 --> 5275.679
well nathan yamaha warmer means less

5275.199 --> 5279.678999999999
dense

5275.679 --> 5283.04
opposite of the earth no

5279.679 --> 5287.36
no you could see it in a different way

5283.04 --> 5290.4
colder will shrink the gas

5287.36 --> 5294.239
causing locally

5290.4 --> 5297.36
less dense

5294.239 --> 5301.36
and then heat

5297.36 --> 5305.44
expands the gas locally creating more

5301.36 --> 5308.719
pressure you think about it like that

5305.44 --> 5310.0
as a constant influence in a dynamic

5308.719 --> 5312.96
system

5310.0 --> 5314.08
then yes a gradient could more or less

5312.96 --> 5323.84
stably form

5314.08 --> 5323.84
within it

5354.96 --> 5365.84
eat a pickle so why eat plenty of salt

5360.159 --> 5365.839999999999
nathan yamaha

5366.239 --> 5368.48
what

5377.199 --> 5379.839999999999
what

5426.56 --> 5435.84
uh mark no i don't know

5443.28 --> 5450.48
oh it just became light again

5446.48 --> 5450.48
in the flatter's early bird background

5451.36 --> 5456.5599999999995
it would be cool if there was a little

5453.199 --> 5459.759999999999
smoother transition of that

5456.56 --> 5463.84
but oh well i'm not gonna complain

5459.76 --> 5463.84
it's still a great background animation

5465.76 --> 5477.84
a gem

5479.36 --> 5487.5199999999995
to remove the densest air first

5483.199 --> 5487.5199999999995
uh no more colored

5488.84 --> 5493.6
that that doesn't really work that way

5494.96 --> 5503.04
it's a mash if it got to spread around

5499.52 --> 5504.080000000001
in all directions freely it's not it's

5503.04 --> 5508.56
not gonna

5504.08 --> 5512.32
separate it's gonna mash into everything

5508.56 --> 5516.4800000000005
you can't remove the thicker air first

5512.32 --> 5516.48
from a tank that's that that's

5516.84 --> 5519.84
impossible

5536.0 --> 5542.639
god too bad

5539.52 --> 5544.0
they can't play together why is that too

5542.639 --> 5545.92
bad

5544.0 --> 5547.84
i'm just glad we don't stick with

5545.92 --> 5551.12
pseudoscience nonsense

5547.84 --> 5553.360000000001
and just in your face fraud claims

5551.12 --> 5554.719
yeah and i'm not gonna get over very

5553.36 --> 5556.88
easily

5554.719 --> 5557.92
like every freaking person that stood

5556.88 --> 5562.08
behind those

5557.92 --> 5564.2390000000005
fraud claims i'm not accepting that this

5562.08 --> 5567.6
is not some political trickery

5564.239 --> 5570.48
this is supposedly science

5567.6 --> 5571.1990000000005
and i'm very heavily appalled by the

5570.48 --> 5573.599999999999
notion that

5571.199 --> 5575.199
any group whether they're supposedly

5573.6 --> 5577.92
flat earthers

5575.199 --> 5579.759999999999
or ballers or whatever are like on

5577.92 --> 5582.719
purpose

5579.76 --> 5583.96
showing fraud to try and make a point

5582.719 --> 5586.96
that's

5583.96 --> 5586.96
inexcusable

5587.12 --> 5591.84
inexcusable the thing where they

5589.84 --> 5595.12
supposedly claim that

5591.84 --> 5599.1990000000005
that gas is susceptible to magnetism

5595.12 --> 5602.719
by showing that gas in its liquid form

5599.199 --> 5605.5199999999995
yeah being repelled it's absolutely

5602.719 --> 5605.52
preposterous

5606.0 --> 5609.84
like that was a deal breaker for me that

5607.84 --> 5612.0
was big time you know before that it was

5609.84 --> 5615.12
kind of like an

5612.0 --> 5617.12
exciting challenge like two

5615.12 --> 5618.639
camps and they're like yeah whose

5617.12 --> 5621.84
philosophy is going to

5618.639 --> 5625.6
win this yeah when you literally

5621.84 --> 5631.84
involve freaking fraud

5625.6 --> 5631.84
it's just now it's not a game anymore

5631.92 --> 5634.719
this yeah

5635.44 --> 5638.799999999999
then there's a whole bunch of people

5636.96 --> 5642.84
that that got

5638.8 --> 5659.84
behind it let's still echo that [ __ ]

5642.84 --> 5659.84
i i'm just very glad i'm not them

5663.199 --> 5671.12
what is the frog the fraud is that

5666.56 --> 5674.4800000000005
gas can be like added at a distance

5671.12 --> 5677.199
influenced like this

5674.48 --> 5678.04
supposed electrostatics magnetism right

5677.199 --> 5680.638999999999
and yeah

5678.04 --> 5683.679
electrostatic charge can absolutely have

5680.639 --> 5686.96
a local influence

5683.679 --> 5688.96
you know it can create a pressure

5686.96 --> 5691.6
differential locally

5688.96 --> 5692.719
create some wind there locally guess

5691.6 --> 5697.280000000001
what

5692.719 --> 5701.52
it's not gonna do it from the ground up

5697.28 --> 5703.92
tens or maybe like hundreds of miles up

5701.52 --> 5705.76
at that distance it's not gonna have

5703.92 --> 5708.08
that same influence because it's always

5705.76 --> 5711.76
local

5708.08 --> 5711.76
and that was the suggestion made

5713.52 --> 5721.040000000001
doesn't do that ever

5717.36 --> 5724.4
it's always local

5721.04 --> 5725.199
with the dying reach further away it

5724.4 --> 5727.04
goes

5725.199 --> 5728.239
at some point it's not going to have any

5727.04 --> 5730.4
effect anymore at

5728.239 --> 5730.4
all

5735.679 --> 5739.4400000000005
right and magnetism just doesn't

5738.239 --> 5742.718999999999
influence gas

5739.44 --> 5744.5599999999995
at all right because what i just talked

5742.719 --> 5744.88
about that's electrostatics you have to

5744.56 --> 5747.76
be

5744.88 --> 5750.4800000000005
physically connected and then a charge

5747.76 --> 5754.96
can have a local repelling effect

5750.48 --> 5758.5599999999995
local not with reach magnetism

5754.96 --> 5763.52
none it does not influence gas ever

5758.56 --> 5767.119000000001
ever does not have an effect on gas ever

5763.52 --> 5770.56
right even though that was falsely

5767.119 --> 5775.44
suggested frauduly

5770.56 --> 5778.320000000001
reified within the defense of the

5775.44 --> 5779.759999999999
incoherent dielectric acceleration blah

5778.32 --> 5783.04
blah blah

5779.76 --> 5786.4800000000005
that thing but way back when was it

5783.04 --> 5789.92
brian was up against wits it over at uh

5786.48 --> 5789.919999999999
qe server

5790.96 --> 5796.84
it has been echoing ever since that

5793.28 --> 5799.44
assertion is still being made

5796.84 --> 5802.56
fraudulently

5799.44 --> 5806.08
that magnetism can influences gas

5802.56 --> 5808.320000000001
it can't ever never ever doesn't do that

5806.08 --> 5811.6
ever

5808.32 --> 5816.08
right liquid sure solid

5811.6 --> 5816.08
sure gas never ever

5825.28 --> 5830.48
all right and we're gonna say oh plasma

5827.679 --> 5834.2390000000005
yeah guess what plasma is not a gas

5830.48 --> 5836.799999999999
it's plasma not a gas

5834.239 --> 5837.759999999999
right so this is just straight down the

5836.8 --> 5841.679
lane of baller

5837.76 --> 5845.360000000001
arguments because before this dielectric

5841.679 --> 5846.32
revolution incoherent dielectric

5845.36 --> 5848.48
revolution

5846.32 --> 5849.44
came to the forefront ballers were

5848.48 --> 5851.44
arguing how

5849.44 --> 5855.839999999999
gas could stick to a ball and using the

5851.44 --> 5855.839999999999
same [ __ ] arguments

5874.159 --> 5881.599999999999
ah yeah guns are never owned

5879.199 --> 5882.32
now tenth man has done everything under

5881.6 --> 5885.1990000000005
the sun

5882.32 --> 5888.32
except cooking his own meals though

5885.199 --> 5890.4
don't think he's ever done that

5888.32 --> 5891.679
i think he was specially raised by his

5890.4 --> 5894.159
parents to

5891.679 --> 5896.32
to not do that and always let his wife

5894.159 --> 5911.839999999999
or daughter do it

5896.32 --> 5911.84
until he died so everything but that

5950.84 --> 5953.84
okay

5964.84 --> 5967.84
hmm

5978.84 --> 5981.84
ugh

6011.36 --> 6013.759999999999
what

6016.639 --> 6020.56
material uh

6021.28 --> 6025.199
what the hell are you just saying there

6025.76 --> 6030.320000000001
yeah gas is a material it is a material

6029.36 --> 6037.28
state

6030.32 --> 6040.32
actually quite provably so

6037.28 --> 6043.119
conflate natural law to air no natural

6040.32 --> 6047.199
applies to air

6043.119 --> 6047.199
natural law applies to all things

6049.04 --> 6051.84
this is weird

6064.08 --> 6067.679
all right see you later clutch bear

6074.88 --> 6080.08
you don't nathan yama don't mix those

6078.32 --> 6083.44
two things that's ridiculous

6080.08 --> 6086.88
serious just physics

6083.44 --> 6090.239
and religion or jesus's teachings

6086.88 --> 6093.84
come on this

6090.239 --> 6093.839999999999
gas mask

6095.52 --> 6107.84
gas has a density

6116.4 --> 6123.839999999999
uh steamy traveler i don't know

6121.52 --> 6126.8
dude there's there's just hostile

6123.84 --> 6128.88
corporate takeovers

6126.8 --> 6130.56
like on a scale never seen before

6128.88 --> 6135.119
happening

6130.56 --> 6137.1990000000005
like all these idealistic progresses

6135.119 --> 6138.32
that were potentially there in the past

6137.199 --> 6141.759999999999
and got halt

6138.32 --> 6144.0
none of that is gonna apply like if

6141.76 --> 6145.84
anything if they would drag it back such

6144.0 --> 6149.04
a concept they would only do it

6145.84 --> 6151.76
because they found a way to abuse it to

6149.04 --> 6153.5199999999995
the extreme level

6151.76 --> 6154.96
right because if you're going to be able

6153.52 --> 6157.360000000001
to transfer energy

6154.96 --> 6158.639
over a distance like that yeah then you

6157.36 --> 6163.04
could probably freaking

6158.639 --> 6166.2390000000005
weaponize it as well so

6163.04 --> 6169.76
like dreaming about these ancient

6166.239 --> 6171.5199999999995
or ancient the old past potential

6169.76 --> 6174.2390000000005
revolutions

6171.52 --> 6175.4400000000005
yeah anything that was dream dark back

6174.239 --> 6178.159
then

6175.44 --> 6180.08
anything that would was dreamed up can

6178.159 --> 6180.96
be used at this point as a weapon of

6180.08 --> 6185.04
some kind

6180.96 --> 6188.4
under control of these people so no

6185.04 --> 6191.679
nothing good is going to be created

6188.4 --> 6194.239
at this point until these control

6191.679 --> 6196.2390000000005
people that are doing all this [ __ ]

6194.239 --> 6205.839999999999
driving this forth

6196.239 --> 6205.839999999999
are just gone

6238.32 --> 6246.719
right also like the idea of

6242.239 --> 6248.36
electric transfer through the air

6246.719 --> 6250.08
it doesn't really coincide with

6248.36 --> 6251.679
telecommunication

6250.08 --> 6255.199
that's not going to work together well

6251.679 --> 6255.1990000000005
it's going to get in each other's way

6255.6 --> 6265.04
right whether you're sending out energy

6260.8 --> 6268.320000000001
or information it's going to occupy the

6265.04 --> 6270.48
airwaves as they say or the ether

6268.32 --> 6272.84
so whatever you're going to do with it

6270.48 --> 6274.159
that's what's going to take up that

6272.84 --> 6277.76
space

6274.159 --> 6279.28
so yeah with an information wireless

6277.76 --> 6281.360000000001
information revolution

6279.28 --> 6282.88
yeah wireless energy transfer that

6281.36 --> 6284.08
that's not really going to work well

6282.88 --> 6289.84
together

6284.08 --> 6289.84
can already predict that very easily

6290.32 --> 6292.639
dude

6300.84 --> 6305.04
okay i don't know why you needed to hide

6303.92 --> 6317.84
him for that

6305.04 --> 6317.84
it's a little silly of him but

6338.0 --> 6342.719
ice is colder than liquid water ice goes

6340.56 --> 6342.719
up

6343.28 --> 6350.8
well but ice only goes up because it's

6347.52 --> 6350.8
less dense than water

6350.96 --> 6354.2390000000005
because in its crystallized state it

6353.6 --> 6359.84
takes up

6354.239 --> 6359.839999999999
less space

6379.36 --> 6383.679
quantum entanglement oh god

6384.0 --> 6389.199
really that's what you're gonna use for

6385.84 --> 6393.04
your time traveling experiments

6389.199 --> 6393.04
i can already tell you it's not gonna go

6398.84 --> 6401.84
anywhere

6438.56 --> 6445.76
well more colored it's complicated

6442.96 --> 6447.28
technically it doesn't lose density it

6445.76 --> 6452.2390000000005
expands

6447.28 --> 6452.239
so it kind of remains the same amount of

6452.48 --> 6459.599999999999
mass let's get complicated

6456.239 --> 6459.599999999999
but it does expand

6460.96 --> 6470.08
so it doesn't actually lose density

6464.48 --> 6473.119
in the same volume it expands

6470.08 --> 6476.0
that's how it can literally just break

6473.119 --> 6476.0
stone apart

6476.56 --> 6480.4800000000005
getting water seeped in and then

6478.159 --> 6484.719
freezing the water and it will break

6480.48 --> 6488.08
the stone no matter how strong it is

6484.719 --> 6488.08
because it will expand

6491.04 --> 6499.84
that's why frozen pipes in your house

6492.719 --> 6499.84
can burst exactly

6507.6 --> 6512.159000000001
right so it doesn't lose density but it

6510.56 --> 6515.52
increases in volume

6512.159 --> 6518.239
but that's what it comes down to

6515.52 --> 6519.6
that effectively makes the mass of it

6518.239 --> 6527.839999999999
the total of it

6519.6 --> 6527.84
less dense volumetrically

6552.84 --> 6555.84
uh

6557.119 --> 6564.32
well matthew eastman it depends

6561.04 --> 6567.92
in your setup what the phenomenon really

6564.32 --> 6568.96
is that you're using for your experiment

6567.92 --> 6572.719
you know you can

6568.96 --> 6576.08
use equipment in an experiment

6572.719 --> 6580.4
it's just that the phenomenon

6576.08 --> 6584.0
has to happen it has to be a natural

6580.4 --> 6587.5199999999995
side effect this is where it has to be

6584.0 --> 6591.52
it has to be possible in nature

6587.52 --> 6591.52
yeah it's a little complicated like that

6591.679 --> 6595.04
but it really depends on the phenomenon

6593.679 --> 6611.84
you're trying to

6595.04 --> 6611.84
to experiment with

6650.84 --> 6653.84
hmm

6654.4 --> 6658.239
right i'm gonna round out the show guys

6660.719 --> 6666.08
it's been it's been decently interesting

6664.159 --> 6669.199
glad to get rid of some trolls that i'm

6666.08 --> 6669.199
not going to be missing

6670.719 --> 6676.32
right so thanks everyone for coming

6674.159 --> 6678.32
i hope you like this show if you did

so far

6706.0 --> 6710.88
right i will be back tomorrow flat earth

6708.239 --> 6714.879999999999
early bird number 843

6710.88 --> 6718.719
on the thursday edition

6714.88 --> 6722.2390000000005
hashtag mifa indeed amanda young

6718.719 --> 6726.159
yeah again no no flatters debates today

6722.239 --> 6730.0
as nathan's wife's birthday is the day

6726.159 --> 6731.04
so yeah you'll probably see me hanging

6730.0 --> 6735.119
around

6731.04 --> 6738.239
maybe 24 7 letter discord or brandon's

6735.119 --> 6750.37
i'll show up somewhere right so

6738.239 --> 6755.0
until the next video keep it flat

6750.37 --> 6755.0
[Music]

6757.57 --> 6760.759999999999
[Music]

6762.84 --> 6765.84
hmm

6767.32 --> 6774.94
[Music]

6777.84 --> 6779.92
you
