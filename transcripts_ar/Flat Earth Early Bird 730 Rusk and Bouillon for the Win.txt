right so yeah i'm back

125.6 --> 130.399
back to normal so what's uh

130.479 --> 133.84
seven days nah sixth day yeah i guess

133.44 --> 137.35999999999999
this

133.84 --> 140.72
i'm still not entirely back to normal so

137.36 --> 145.04000000000002
it's seven days seven days

140.72 --> 148.08
seven days right and i'm back to normal

145.04 --> 151.2
sort of i feel back to normal i

148.08 --> 154.48000000000002
just tried my first micro

151.2 --> 156.319
joint thing and you know why

154.48 --> 157.67999999999998
not because i was like oh man i can't

156.319 --> 159.44
wait but just

157.68 --> 161.28
i thought maybe it would stop the

159.44 --> 163.44
freaking saliva man

161.28 --> 165.92
i'm going nuts with the saliva it's

163.44 --> 169.599
still going it's like

165.92 --> 172.879
what is the cubic centimeter of saliva

169.599 --> 176.879
a minute it's crazy it just keeps

172.879 --> 177.599
pouring ugh but yeah that didn't really

176.879 --> 179.44
work

177.599 --> 181.51899999999998
what did work though is that it totally

179.44 --> 182.48
grossed me out so i had to immediately

181.519 --> 184.56
brush my teeth

182.48 --> 186.319
to try and get that disgusting taste out

184.56 --> 188.4
of there god

186.319 --> 190.39999999999998
i don't understand how i ever like this

188.4 --> 192.4
[ __ ] like the taste of it

190.4 --> 195.28
i really like the taste i i don't get it

192.4 --> 198.08
anymore it changed

195.28 --> 198.64000000000001
i feel like i've had a giant metabolic

198.08 --> 202.239
overall

198.64 --> 202.55999999999997
giant and also i i started to realize

202.239 --> 206.72
like

202.56 --> 208.799
holy [ __ ] i did not have any

206.72 --> 210.319
any kind of sort of distortion or

208.799 --> 214.08
feeling issue

210.319 --> 215.83999999999997
with my teeth at all the entire week

214.08 --> 217.12
even though i was like throwing up and

215.84 --> 218.959
[ __ ] first

217.12 --> 221.12
i was afraid like oh my god i'm gonna

218.959 --> 224.31900000000002
erode my teeth it's gonna go to hell

221.12 --> 228.159
well no i've

224.319 --> 231.35999999999999
i've never felt better in my

228.159 --> 231.84
gums and all that in the last week than

231.36 --> 236.15900000000002
i have

231.84 --> 238.239
in years it's crazy right

236.159 --> 240.07999999999998
anyway uh yeah it's good to be back it's

238.239 --> 241.439
saturday so it's gonna be one and a half

240.08 --> 243.36
hour show at least

241.439 --> 245.92
might be two hours or more i don't know

243.36 --> 246.72000000000003
i feel like doing a lot but here is the

245.92 --> 249.51899999999998
weather

246.72 --> 251.439
it's a little better it's not as gray it

249.519 --> 254.48000000000002
was a little gray this morning although

251.439 --> 255.12
yeah this is interesting little perhaps

254.48 --> 258.15999999999997
uh

255.12 --> 259.84000000000003
those flat fluffy clouds like a mattress

258.16 --> 262.96000000000004
is up there

259.84 --> 264.4
that's kind of funny and this morning i

262.96 --> 267.28
saw it when the sun came up

264.4 --> 268.32
it was all pink so it was like a pink

267.28 --> 270.63899999999995
cushion

268.32 --> 271.36
over here isn't that just pretty how it

270.639 --> 274.40000000000003
looks

271.36 --> 277.68
look at that almost like there's a oh

274.4 --> 281.03999999999996
there's an ice up there it's ice it's

277.68 --> 282.40000000000003
eyes of the dome if you fantasize about

281.04 --> 286.24
it

282.4 --> 289.35999999999996
see it's ice on the top of the dome it's

286.24 --> 291.84000000000003
so cold there's ice up there

289.36 --> 293.52000000000004
yeah of course it's clouds but it you

291.84 --> 294.84
yeah from a distance it kind of does

293.52 --> 297.59999999999997
look like

294.84 --> 299.84
ice like hold on let's see if i can do

297.6 --> 299.84000000000003
that

300.32 --> 305.199
right so doesn't it kind of look like

302.32 --> 308.08
you're overlooking over ice like this

305.199 --> 311.28000000000003
if you didn't know better right like

308.08 --> 313.19899999999996
you're looking on water

311.28 --> 316.08
tell me people in chat doesn't it look a

313.199 --> 318.88
little bit like ice

316.08 --> 318.88
frozen water

320.4 --> 325.84
come on

326.24 --> 329.039
say something

330.16 --> 335.03900000000004
yeah it does doesn't it cool

333.4 --> 337.44
[Music]

335.039 --> 338.88
so yeah this is very picturesque up

337.44 --> 341.68
there

338.88 --> 341.68
quite beautiful

344.32 --> 351.199
right it's safe to say i'm

348.16 --> 354.96000000000004
slightly less pissed off than yesterday

351.199 --> 354.96000000000004
on a more silly note i think

355.28 --> 360.88
yeah today

358.8 --> 363.52000000000004
50 minutes before the show not because

360.88 --> 367.44
of smoking before smoking

363.52 --> 371.12
i remembered oh wait i have an ass

367.44 --> 374.8
because i was like oh i have to poo

371.12 --> 376.56
that's what i haven't i literally

374.8 --> 380.0
haven't done that

376.56 --> 383.12
since like sunday morning

380.0 --> 385.919
that's weird to realize that man like

383.12 --> 386.96
what how does that even work how can it

385.919 --> 390.4
stay

386.96 --> 392.79999999999995
for that long and yeah

390.4 --> 394.96
kind of weird too much information yeah

392.8 --> 397.199
it's too bad because i just told you

394.96 --> 398.15999999999997
look this is for me almost like a

397.199 --> 400.0
medical report

398.16 --> 401.6
you don't have to fantasize about it

400.0 --> 403.68
it's disgusting i know

401.6 --> 404.72
but it's just it weirded me out like

403.68 --> 408.319
what i

404.72 --> 412.0
i literally didn't remember

408.319 --> 413.12
it was like oh wait oh yeah human beings

412.0 --> 414.83
poo

413.12 --> 416.16
what the [ __ ] i completely forgot

414.83 --> 419.19899999999996
[Music]

416.16 --> 421.759
so odd because it it just

419.199 --> 423.91900000000004
there was no more yeah i didn't have any

421.759 --> 425.36
kind of diarrhea or anything as i said

423.919 --> 427.52
my entire intestines have been

425.36 --> 429.52000000000004
completely fine during this whole time

427.52 --> 431.84
it was really only my stomach and the

429.52 --> 434.88
directly surrounding organs

431.84 --> 438.0
so yeah it had kind of laid still

434.88 --> 440.24
for a very long time and it's fine

438.0 --> 442.8
right also yeah i'm not gonna just talk

440.24 --> 446.24
about food and [ __ ] all day

442.8 --> 448.96000000000004
during this show so don't worry about it

446.24 --> 450.319
but uh how do i feel about yesterday's

448.96 --> 453.44
show i thought it was

450.319 --> 454.639
awesome i thought it was all that and

453.44 --> 457.759
that shocked me

454.639 --> 458.56
because i looked back yesterday like a

457.759 --> 461.68
bit after

458.56 --> 464.879
and i was like no no

461.68 --> 467.44
actually no i was

464.879 --> 469.28000000000003
i actually liked i actually stand by

467.44 --> 472.56
what i said

469.28 --> 474.31899999999996
and yeah it's rough it's very rough to

472.56 --> 474.72
say these things but then i thought yeah

474.319 --> 478.56
but

474.72 --> 480.8
that's the [ __ ] reality and i'm just

478.56 --> 484.639
calling it

480.8 --> 487.52000000000004
as it really is [ __ ] insane

484.639 --> 488.8
and what should be the insane counter

487.52 --> 491.919
consequences

488.8 --> 492.72
which i cannot envision happening it's

491.919 --> 496.4
just that

492.72 --> 499.03900000000004
it's driving everything insane but

496.4 --> 499.75899999999996
yeah that was very odd watching it back

499.039 --> 502.15999999999997
and then

499.759 --> 502.879
and actually not being repulsed at all

502.16 --> 506.47900000000004
at all

502.879 --> 508.639
i thought it was great

506.479 --> 510.639
i was almost like damn i wish i'd gone

508.639 --> 511.44
another hour or something because it was

510.639 --> 514.08
good i

511.44 --> 516.32
maybe i just missed doing it a lot and i

514.08 --> 519.839
had a lot of fresh energy

516.32 --> 519.839
saved up from a week doing it

520.32 --> 524.72
right anyway i got the green tea with me

522.479 --> 525.6
which is experiment because i haven't

524.72 --> 529.279
had literal

525.6 --> 529.9200000000001
green tea before this moment before this

529.279 --> 535.8389999999999
very sip

529.92 --> 535.8389999999999
this one's got to call them

539.2 --> 543.36
you must fight the demons oh well the

541.839 --> 545.9200000000001
thing is

543.36 --> 547.12
it's not look i'm not saying oh look

545.92 --> 549.12
what typically

547.12 --> 551.36
would happen what typically people would

549.12 --> 553.76
recognize is that somebody

551.36 --> 556.399
would bring up some kind of ruse to rile

553.76 --> 559.04
people up under some pretext

556.399 --> 560.16
and then actually do something horrific

559.04 --> 562.56
you know

560.16 --> 565.04
target specific people and then in

562.56 --> 567.5189999999999
retrospect it turns out oh wait that's

565.04 --> 568.64
actually my business plan or something

567.519 --> 572.16
right that's

568.64 --> 572.959
what nazis usually do that's their

572.16 --> 576.8
tactic

572.959 --> 579.8389999999999
it's like corporate statism it's

576.8 --> 580.16
well i don't have that plan at all never

579.839 --> 582.8800000000001
had

580.16 --> 584.3199999999999
i'm rather like look guys if you're all

582.88 --> 587.4399999999999
just sick of it

584.32 --> 587.9200000000001
i'm here i'll i'll make the decisions if

587.44 --> 590.0
you all

587.92 --> 592.4799999999999
feel too weak to do it and i'll do

590.0 --> 594.88
whatever is necessary

592.48 --> 596.9590000000001
but i don't have some ambition like oh i

594.88 --> 598.24
can't wait until the people all get too

596.959 --> 601.04
sick

598.24 --> 602.8
of it and then i can fool them into

601.04 --> 604.0
doing this and this to get all this

602.8 --> 606.399
[ __ ] power and

604.0 --> 607.839
control and money and [ __ ] because i

606.399 --> 611.12
literally don't give a

607.839 --> 611.839
[ __ ] about that i just want things to be

611.12 --> 614.64
better

611.839 --> 616.839
i really want it and i want the rest of

614.64 --> 618.56
the world to be better not just [ __ ]

616.839 --> 621.6
me

618.56 --> 625.1999999999999
and i guess that is really

621.6 --> 626.16
oh god ambo really and that is really

625.2 --> 629.2
kind of

626.16 --> 632.64
yeah what what

629.2 --> 634.32
did not make it feel the way that i

632.64 --> 635.92
thought it was gonna feel watching it

634.32 --> 640.24
back

635.92 --> 640.24
right anyway let's see who is in chat

640.399 --> 644.0
youtube is incredibly behind again as

643.2 --> 647.36
usual

644.0 --> 650.24

yeah good to see you all

666.7 --> 669.759
[Music]

669.839 --> 673.0400000000001
right so how are you guys and girls all

672.56 --> 675.04
doing

673.04 --> 677.12
i yeah besides the green tea i had a

675.04 --> 680.0
little experiment

677.12 --> 680.64
it's continuing this is sort of like

680.0 --> 683.12
yogurt

680.64 --> 684.72
with fresh fruit and originally i

683.12 --> 688.079
thought yeah i'm gonna make a fruit

684.72 --> 691.76
yogurt thing yay and then i realized

688.079 --> 692.8
hmm i don't know my my stomach doesn't

691.76 --> 695.92
really like

692.8 --> 698.4799999999999
the feeling of fruit in it it's weird

695.92 --> 700.24
because i've drink i drank two liters of

698.48 --> 702.0
bouillon yesterday

700.24 --> 703.839
like after like during the show i i

702.0 --> 705.839
think i drank like half a liter

703.839 --> 706.8800000000001
well i drank another one and a half of

705.839 --> 709.6800000000001
that there it like

706.88 --> 710.079
constantly kept chugging it i loved it

709.68 --> 712.56
no

710.079 --> 713.92
stomach problems whatsoever it's just

712.56 --> 717.04
nothing

713.92 --> 718.7199999999999
none it's like all the nausea is gone

717.04 --> 720.24
all the pain is gone and this morning i

718.72 --> 723.36
tried this

720.24 --> 724.8
and then it's like okay that's oh yeah

723.36 --> 727.92
that's a little too tough

724.8 --> 729.04
and i also chucked apple juice raw apple

727.92 --> 731.92
juice oh man

729.04 --> 733.68
raw apple juice and yeah that just no

731.92 --> 736.24
problem it's just a little raw

733.68 --> 737.5999999999999
and with this too so i then put it in a

736.24 --> 739.839
blender

737.6 --> 741.2
and then filtered all this yeah all the

739.839 --> 742.839
the stuff out

741.2 --> 746.72
and so it's kind of like a smoothie

742.839 --> 750.0
drink it's still a bit yes there's raw

746.72 --> 753.9200000000001
fruits in it put banana

750.0 --> 758.8
blueberries apple uh

753.92 --> 761.1999999999999
orange forget anything

758.8 --> 762.24
no that's it yeah that's in there and

761.2 --> 765.6
like really good

762.24 --> 767.76
organic high grade quality

765.6 --> 769.279
like fresh type of yogurt not sour

767.76 --> 771.519
yogurt the one that

769.279 --> 773.6
that tends to get a little lumpy it's

771.519 --> 774.079
really good stuff good for regenerating

773.6 --> 776.32
your

774.079 --> 779.12
flora although yeah my floor seems to be

776.32 --> 779.12
perfectly fine

781.68 --> 785.12
it is quite delicious though

785.2 --> 788.399
but again the the raw fruit element it

787.44 --> 791.7600000000001
just

788.399 --> 792.88
feels a little rough here i don't know

791.76 --> 794.72
why

792.88 --> 797.2
might take some more time before that

794.72 --> 797.2
stops

797.519 --> 804.639
so but yeah in the meantime

801.2 --> 809.44
rosk lots of rusk

804.639 --> 812.24
and lots of yeah bullion

809.44 --> 813.2
but i'm almost kind of sick i do i think

812.24 --> 816.72
i'm gonna try

813.2 --> 817.279
baked eggs after the show for the first

816.72 --> 820.9590000000001
time

817.279 --> 824.24
on some bread it's been a while

820.959 --> 825.1199999999999
but i think i can take it it really

824.24 --> 827.92
seems to be the

825.12 --> 829.04
the pure fruits the sour fruits that

827.92 --> 843.8389999999999
that do the

829.04 --> 843.8389999999999
the leftover hurting

845.12 --> 848.72
yeah hey michael jones yeah i did give

847.12 --> 856.399
you a wrench

848.72 --> 859.519
you're a good guy i think you deserve it

856.399 --> 861.68
and yeah it's general rule if you abuse

859.519 --> 864.079
it you immediately use it

861.68 --> 865.92
if you abuse it you immediately lose it

864.079 --> 868.8
so

865.92 --> 869.279
don't start poking around it's not funny

868.8 --> 871.92
yeah

869.279 --> 873.6
yeah about that strict thing that i do

871.92 --> 875.8389999999999
that i did yesterday

873.6 --> 879.0400000000001
i think i've kind of liked it i think

875.839 --> 879.0400000000001
i'm gonna do that more

879.279 --> 887.12
because i'm one thing that hasn't really

883.04 --> 887.12
changed since yesterday is that

887.279 --> 893.36
i am so sick of tolerance

890.32 --> 896.399
i am so [ __ ] sick

893.36 --> 899.1990000000001
of tolerance tolerance

896.399 --> 900.72
has destroyed this [ __ ] world and i'm

899.199 --> 904.079
done with it

900.72 --> 907.1990000000001
[ __ ] tolerance

904.079 --> 908.959
[ __ ] tolerance [ __ ]

907.199 --> 910.88
tolerance that doesn't mean that you're

908.959 --> 911.4399999999999
good oh time to be a complete [ __ ]

910.88 --> 913.36
and just

911.44 --> 914.5600000000001
pick fights with people like a [ __ ]

913.36 --> 916.0
[ __ ] no

914.56 --> 917.4399999999999
of course not now if you do that you get

916.0 --> 918.24
your [ __ ] face bashed in as you

917.44 --> 921.44
should

918.24 --> 922.88
but yeah this nonsense [ __ ] like oh

921.44 --> 924.72
you gotta do this you gotta do that

922.88 --> 928.079
because you're gonna be taller than this

924.72 --> 931.279
don't be mean because of this [ __ ] you

928.079 --> 932.959
[ __ ] i'll do whatever the [ __ ] i want

931.279 --> 936.639
and i'll say it exactly as i

932.959 --> 940.88
[ __ ] feel [ __ ] yeah

936.639 --> 944.8
that's what i'm gonna do more and more

940.88 --> 948.0
because i'm [ __ ] sick of tolerance

944.8 --> 948.0
it's the worst

948.16 --> 955.8389999999999
it's the worst i hate it

960.32 --> 965.44
yeah i don't give a [ __ ] paul kieran

963.68 --> 969.12
if you want to be a concaver that's your

965.44 --> 973.519
problem don't bother me with it

969.12 --> 975.519
there's no curvature it's flat

973.519 --> 978.72
if you say your concave that's a nice

975.519 --> 983.279
fantasy there's no curvature

978.72 --> 986.0790000000001
a chao yoon cat

983.279 --> 988.16
all right and i also st i was very proud

986.079 --> 989.4399999999999
actually listening back to how i summed

988.16 --> 992.16
up things

989.44 --> 992.72
about the pharisees and all the religion

992.16 --> 995.92
how i

992.72 --> 997.1990000000001
carefully separated my feelings for the

995.92 --> 1000.24
jews

997.199 --> 1002.959
well yeah whatever that means the hebrew

1000.24 --> 1004.0790000000001
and even muslims because yeah there's

1002.959 --> 1006.7199999999999
plenty of people

1004.079 --> 1007.279
muslims out here and you can see i can

1006.72 --> 1010.8000000000001
see

1007.279 --> 1014.56
when they are muslims it's like typical

1010.8 --> 1019.04
and they're just modest really

1014.56 --> 1020.88
serious people that are very

1019.04 --> 1022.88
they're very spiritually still and

1020.88 --> 1025.199
careful

1022.88 --> 1027.919
and then you have the youth then just

1025.199 --> 1027.919
[ __ ] around

1028.48 --> 1031.679
and some are like very passionate but

1030.4 --> 1034.959
that's that's like

1031.679 --> 1037.52
norm that's how you should damn well be

1034.959 --> 1038.959
and not like some disgusting greedy

1037.52 --> 1041.039
piece of [ __ ]

1038.959 --> 1042.64
or look i want a good power we can't

1041.039 --> 1045.12
wait to kill everybody just to get

1042.64 --> 1046.0790000000002
peer control and dictate everybody my

1045.12 --> 1049.36
[ __ ] will

1046.079 --> 1052.6399999999999
that sort of [ __ ] i'm so sick

1049.36 --> 1055.28
of this this constant mix in

1052.64 --> 1056.64
of everything that is good with

1055.28 --> 1059.2
everything that's evil

1056.64 --> 1059.919
and the media has done this like nothing

1059.2 --> 1062.64
else

1059.919 --> 1063.5200000000002
on every front alternative media

1062.64 --> 1067.1200000000001
mainstream

1063.52 --> 1067.84
they've done this this this was the new

1067.12 --> 1071.6789999999999
ground

1067.84 --> 1075.039
the division of everything the division

1071.679 --> 1079.3600000000001
of all culture all religion was

1075.039 --> 1082.48
the new ground in media

1079.36 --> 1083.36
that is what we have all together even

1082.48 --> 1087.3600000000001
grown on

1083.36 --> 1090.3999999999999
because flat earth globe

1087.36 --> 1094.559
christian against islam

1090.4 --> 1097.1200000000001
and then new world order gets

1094.559 --> 1097.9189999999999
whatever and it just never stops it's

1097.12 --> 1101.1999999999998
the [ __ ]

1097.919 --> 1103.76
division [ __ ]

1101.2 --> 1105.1200000000001
and i'm gonna go against this like no

1103.76 --> 1108.0
[ __ ] your division

1105.12 --> 1109.28
you go after the method you go after the

1108.0 --> 1112.4
spirit of it

1109.28 --> 1113.76
you go after what is in the person

1112.4 --> 1115.919
that's doing it

1113.76 --> 1118.16
that should be the target the only

1115.919 --> 1121.2800000000002
target traits

1118.16 --> 1124.0
actions that should be

1121.28 --> 1125.28
the target not some [ __ ] name

1124.0 --> 1128.16
religion

1125.28 --> 1129.2
belief race whatever the [ __ ] that even

1128.16 --> 1130.799
supposed to mean

1129.2 --> 1132.72
race isn't even a real thing it's a

1130.799 --> 1136.48
construct it's a fake

1132.72 --> 1138.4
construct now if you say oh okay well

1136.48 --> 1140.24
if you're gonna be real with race well

1138.4 --> 1142.48
what tribe are you from

1140.24 --> 1144.24
what region how long have they been

1142.48 --> 1146.16
there yeah do people even have this

1144.24 --> 1147.919
knowledge yeah that could be considered

1146.16 --> 1150.0800000000002
some sort of a race because then the

1147.919 --> 1152.96
genetics actually matters

1150.08 --> 1153.84
because this a superficial look is

1152.96 --> 1157.039
absolutely

1153.84 --> 1159.28
[ __ ] to call that race

1157.039 --> 1160.96
dumb and all the people that do that

1159.28 --> 1164.559
just i hate them i

1160.96 --> 1167.679
hate them i hate racist

1164.559 --> 1168.0
people and racist people are the ones

1167.679 --> 1171.1200000000001
that

1168.0 --> 1174.08
whine about other people being racist

1171.12 --> 1175.12
racist people whine about people being

1174.08 --> 1178.32
racist

1175.12 --> 1179.1999999999998
i hate them i hate people whining about

1178.32 --> 1181.4399999999998
racism

1179.2 --> 1182.4
shut your [ __ ] mouth you goddamn

1181.44 --> 1185.039
[ __ ]

1182.4 --> 1186.48
kill yourself get the [ __ ] out of here

1185.039 --> 1188.8799999999999
and act like a normal

1186.48 --> 1190.72
civilized human being with some [ __ ]

1188.88 --> 1194.3200000000002
respect for yourself and others

1190.72 --> 1194.32
you [ __ ] retards

1195.039 --> 1198.4
yeah yeah nathan oakley your kids

1197.44 --> 1201.44
shouldn't be watching

1198.4 --> 1203.76
this is obviously 12 plus

1201.44 --> 1205.2
the video is officially registered as

1203.76 --> 1207.44
such if you're gonna have your kids

1205.2 --> 1211.1200000000001
watching that's your own damn business

1207.44 --> 1214.21
but yeah so this is

1211.12 --> 1216.6399999999999
my narrative now

1214.21 --> 1221.8400000000001
[Music]

1216.64 --> 1221.8400000000001
all right cheers

1227.12 --> 1230.1589999999999
turn you down a bit

1230.559 --> 1235.84
spaced racist tolerance that's

1232.84 --> 1235.84
ridiculous

1240.64 --> 1245.679
oh you're poking me are you oh okay well

1243.919 --> 1249.8400000000001
then you're getting a timeout next time

1245.679 --> 1249.8400000000001
you're banned polk urine

1251.44 --> 1255.28
i don't like you poking people

1253.28 --> 1256.0
especially if you come out as a [ __ ]

1255.28 --> 1257.76
concave

1256.0 --> 1259.039
which is dumb because there is no

1257.76 --> 1262.08
curvature

1259.039 --> 1263.28
there is no curvature you [ __ ] [ __ ]

1262.08 --> 1265.9189999999999
it doesn't matter what you

1263.28 --> 1267.76
think the world is as a concave thing

1265.919 --> 1271.919
there is no curvature

1267.76 --> 1275.52
there is no curvature

1271.919 --> 1280.0
concave is not a realistic

1275.52 --> 1280.0
option stop being a [ __ ]

1285.2 --> 1291.8400000000001
all right

1292.12 --> 1299.4399999999998
[Music]

1295.44 --> 1299.44
that green tea is not working for me

1302.48 --> 1307.1200000000001
i don't know man my taste maybe it's

1304.72 --> 1309.679
also just because i smoked

1307.12 --> 1311.84
just everything changed it might taste

1309.679 --> 1313.76
so weird

1311.84 --> 1315.52
and now i also realize that this is

1313.76 --> 1318.48
actually kind of painful

1315.52 --> 1319.52
so i can imagine how i [ __ ] up after

1318.48 --> 1322.64
the sunday

1319.52 --> 1324.8799999999999
show was it sunday no monday show

1322.64 --> 1326.72
because i had green tea then i was

1324.88 --> 1328.7990000000002
sipping on it

1326.72 --> 1330.799
and i was probably so much in stress

1328.799 --> 1332.4
that i even didn't notice that it was

1330.799 --> 1334.6399999999999
not good for me

1332.4 --> 1337.2
because yeah afterward i had like

1334.64 --> 1341.2
immediately started throwing up and [ __ ]

1337.2 --> 1343.679
i did report on that later but

1341.2 --> 1344.64
now i realize like wow i should not have

1343.679 --> 1347.1200000000001
drunk i

1344.64 --> 1348.5590000000002
should never drink greek tea when i'm in

1347.12 --> 1351.4399999999998
this sort of state

1348.559 --> 1351.44
that's not good

1352.96 --> 1358.32
i'm just going to eat a bit of rusk damn

1355.919 --> 1360.48
roscoe is a rusk

1358.32 --> 1363.2
oh hey if you can eat it you can eat it

1360.48 --> 1365.3600000000001
oh maybe i'll get some bouillon oh

1363.2 --> 1366.88
i'm getting a bouillon addiction oh and

1365.36 --> 1369.6
i tried the chicken bouillon that was

1366.88 --> 1369.6000000000001
also pretty good

1369.679 --> 1372.88
who knows man i don't care if i can live

1371.76 --> 1375.6
a freaking rusk

1372.88 --> 1377.2800000000002
and bullion the rest of my life and feel

1375.6 --> 1380.24
this good

1377.28 --> 1380.799
i'm all for it but i am gonna try my

1380.24 --> 1384.48
chicken

1380.799 --> 1387.44
and broccoli treat this evening

1384.48 --> 1403.84
so maybe that'll change some more in in

1387.44 --> 1403.8400000000001
my system

1407.52 --> 1411.28
all right our ramen stone ramestan stone

1410.32 --> 1412.96
that's nice

1411.28 --> 1417.44
i don't know exactly what you mean with

1412.96 --> 1419.6000000000001
a friend in christ

1417.44 --> 1421.1200000000001
i follow the path of christ in my own

1419.6 --> 1423.9189999999999
way

1421.12 --> 1425.6
but i have rage i don't know if i can

1423.919 --> 1427.679
ever get rid of this rage within this

1425.6 --> 1430.0
lifetime because this rage is

1427.679 --> 1432.159
obviously in response to the [ __ ] up

1430.0 --> 1435.279
state of this world

1432.159 --> 1438.3200000000002
psychologically which

1435.279 --> 1442.48
the more you clear up the more you

1438.32 --> 1446.0
fine-tune your spirit the worse it gets

1442.48 --> 1449.76
and since i am having a goal in

yeah this is like yeah this standard

1523.039 --> 1526.799
of dumb questions i'm not gonna tolerate

1525.12 --> 1530.2399999999998

you may like me now you're not gonna

1548.0 --> 1552.159
like me

1549.2 --> 1553.919
anymore if you keep being this stupid if

1552.159 --> 1557.7600000000002
you're gonna ask a question

1553.919 --> 1559.919
don't enter at the first opportunity

1557.76 --> 1560.96
look at what you're typing and then

1559.919 --> 1563.1200000000001
think about

1560.96 --> 1564.24
what do you think i'm gonna say you

1563.12 --> 1567.84
don't need

1564.24 --> 1571.039
me to [ __ ] say anything

1567.84 --> 1572.559
to answer probably 95 of the standard

1571.039 --> 1576.48
questions that come up with you

1572.559 --> 1579.52
why don't you [ __ ] answer my question

1576.48 --> 1580.08
you i mean your question through me you

1579.52 --> 1582.96
know me

1580.08 --> 1584.799
you know what i should answer no i'm not

1582.96 --> 1585.2
calm down don't [ __ ] tell me to calm

1584.799 --> 1588.32
down

1585.2 --> 1588.32
ever ever

1588.64 --> 1592.159
because this is an issue and it's all of

1591.2 --> 1594.559
you

1592.159 --> 1596.48
oh except nathan nathan is probably the

1594.559 --> 1600.0
only one here that's not in

1596.48 --> 1602.08
intellectually inept because he's

1600.0 --> 1603.919
really [ __ ] sharp all the time it's

1602.08 --> 1605.6
probably because he never drinks alco as

1603.919 --> 1609.919
he says

1605.6 --> 1609.9189999999999
and he's just comes from a smart breed

1610.84 --> 1618.72
but what should i say

1613.76 --> 1620.8799999999999
well why why did you ask

1618.72 --> 1623.3600000000001
you asked if you looked into it do you

1620.88 --> 1626.48
want me to talk about astrology

1623.36 --> 1628.559
has something come up with you about

1626.48 --> 1629.6
astrology that interests you that you

1628.559 --> 1632.72
want to share

1629.6 --> 1634.8799999999999
why don't you just say that instead of

1632.72 --> 1637.279
asking a stupid

1634.88 --> 1639.279
ultimately over generalized question

1637.279 --> 1639.76
that of course yes i've looked into a

1639.279 --> 1641.76
strong

1639.76 --> 1644.559
who the [ __ ] in this world hasn't at

1641.76 --> 1644.559
this point man

1646.159 --> 1652.8400000000001
serious think about what you're typing

1649.52 --> 1654.399
when you're typing it before you click

1652.84 --> 1657.52
enter

1654.399 --> 1657.84
it helps your brain you need that you

1657.52 --> 1660.8799999999999
know

1657.84 --> 1663.36
stop being sloppy intellectually with

1660.88 --> 1663.3600000000001
yourself

1663.52 --> 1669.84
i'm trying to help you here

1679.039 --> 1683.84
so was there something about astrology

1686.159 --> 1689.44

1688.159 --> 1692.48
framework

1689.44 --> 1695.279
what you should have been doing so did

1692.48 --> 1697.6
that completely break you now

1695.279 --> 1700.559

1697.6 --> 1700.559
trigger you territ

1701.12 --> 1705.52
no not leave it i want to know why you

1703.679 --> 1707.6000000000001

1707.6 --> 1711.1999999999998
don't people

1708.559 --> 1712.96

of everybody else that is autopiloting

1727.36 --> 1731.279

1857.919 --> 1862.96
maybe i'm just maybe i've out maybe

1860.96 --> 1864.3990000000001
suddenly having escaped all the drugs

1862.96 --> 1866.799
and [ __ ]

1864.399 --> 1868.1589999999999
i just turned into an intolerable person

1866.799 --> 1868.559
because i just thought like what the

1868.159 --> 1871.519
[ __ ]

1868.559 --> 1873.519
is that it was so lame sorry like i like

1871.519 --> 1875.84
the guys i like the guys

1873.519 --> 1876.559
at iron i definitely love adam he's

1875.84 --> 1880.6399999999999
awesome

1876.559 --> 1893.84
but god damn it it's so lame

1880.64 --> 1893.8400000000001
ah there's like nothing happening there

1896.13 --> 1899.269
[Music]

1903.76 --> 1907.76
and i'm gonna say it exactly what it is

1905.6 --> 1908.24
i don't care what people say about it

1907.76 --> 1910.48
anymore

1908.24 --> 1911.36
feel about it if i think something sucks

1910.48 --> 1915.44
i'll just say

1911.36 --> 1917.039
it sucks and i'll say them what i think

1915.44 --> 1920.159
is good about it but i'll say it

1917.039 --> 1921.12
sucks and i thought that iron real media

1920.159 --> 1923.8100000000002
yesterday was so

1921.12 --> 1925.1999999999998
[ __ ] boring

1923.81 --> 1928.8799999999999
[Music]

1925.2 --> 1933.44
they were just all being stoned together

1928.88 --> 1935.44
wasting time ugh like what

1933.44 --> 1936.88
like couldn't you find interest more

1935.44 --> 1938.96
interesting things to talk about it was

1936.88 --> 1942.0
there no spark to do anything

1938.96 --> 1943.08
for [ __ ] sake man look at me i'm

1942.0 --> 1945.84
literally like

1943.08 --> 1946.6399999999999
electrified here bursting with [ __ ]

1945.84 --> 1949.279
energy

1946.64 --> 1953.2
where is your energy what have you done

1949.279 --> 1953.2
with yourself to become like this man

1958.399 --> 1963.84
crack is heroin butt crush wrong

1964.08 --> 1967.519
yeah see i i knew it nathan has never

1966.08 --> 1969.279
used crack because he doesn't even know

1967.519 --> 1973.76
what the [ __ ] it is

1969.279 --> 1976.72
crack is cocaine is processed cocaine

1973.76 --> 1980.08
it's very expensive it's more expensive

1976.72 --> 1980.08
than cocaine you get it

1980.88 --> 1986.48
so you're not gonna pay for [ __ ]

1982.64 --> 1986.48
crack that's ridiculous

1989.84 --> 1994.859
you'd probably not really like it anyway

1991.83 --> 1994.859
[Music]

1998.08 --> 2003.4399999999998
no i wasn't on irm i wat

2001.36 --> 2006.399

2003.44 --> 2006.3990000000001
just god

2009.679 --> 2013.6000000000001
now it's it's not always like it has

2012.24 --> 2016.08
been like that sometimes

2013.6 --> 2017.76
it's just like and they say like look

2016.08 --> 2020.799
we're here to just do

2017.76 --> 2022.72

2020.799 --> 2026.48
of that thing

2022.72 --> 2028.0
this arwen i i i don't have time for

2026.48 --> 2029.679
this [ __ ] anymore

2028.0 --> 2033.279
i want to get real i want to get

2029.679 --> 2035.919

2033.279 --> 2037.919
i want to get society building i want to

2035.919 --> 2040.96
go logos i want to refine

2037.919 --> 2041.44
god i want to find the magic of this

2040.96 --> 2043.679
realm

2041.44 --> 2045.44
because there is literal magic in this

2043.679 --> 2046.96
realm and one of the videos that

2045.44 --> 2048.96
reminded me of that

2046.96 --> 2050.0
which i did share on the flat earth

2048.96 --> 2053.44
early bird show

2050.0 --> 2055.52
was a video by quantum of conscious matt

2053.44 --> 2057.119
great guy he's not yeah sometimes he's a

2055.52 --> 2059.359
bit moo

2057.119 --> 2060.67
just rambles on but this time he had a

2059.359 --> 2063.04
full report

2060.67 --> 2067.76
[Music]

2063.04 --> 2071.52
about yeah monolithic megastructure

2067.76 --> 2074.7200000000003
a giant giant church in cologne

2071.52 --> 2076.879
and that thing is just unbelievable

2074.72 --> 2078.7999999999997
and the weird thing is i've seen it in

2076.879 --> 2079.52
person and it didn't even pay attention

2078.8 --> 2081.28
back then

2079.52 --> 2083.679
because i was too preoccupied with my

2081.28 --> 2085.3590000000004
goofing going here with my goofer and my

2083.679 --> 2086.96
60 60 girlfriend so

2085.359 --> 2089.04
literally nothing else in the world was

2086.96 --> 2090.879
visible to me except her

2089.04 --> 2092.96
like i was just like no i'm going to be

2090.879 --> 2094.96
your bodyguard

2092.96 --> 2096.56
i'm going to defend you with my life i'm

2094.96 --> 2098.48
never going to lose track of you with my

2096.56 --> 2100.24
eyes ever

2098.48 --> 2102.079
and yeah so i knew it's like whoa

2100.24 --> 2104.16
there's this really freaky big

2102.079 --> 2105.28
church here it was evening but i didn't

2104.16 --> 2109.7599999999998
really look at it because

2105.28 --> 2111.76
just i i refused to

2109.76 --> 2115.0400000000004
bend my eyes away from my girlfriend

2111.76 --> 2118.079
enough to really take a good look

2115.04 --> 2120.24
right but mind-blowing

2118.079 --> 2121.599
that thing and it really made me think

2120.24 --> 2124.9599999999996
about a lot of

2121.599 --> 2128.96
weird weird things in this world

2124.96 --> 2131.52
about just

2128.96 --> 2133.839
maybe magical thinking and this is also

2131.52 --> 2134.32
again getting really back into the dark

2133.839 --> 2137.52
world

2134.32 --> 2140.1600000000003
again getting back into the dark world

2137.52 --> 2145.28
remembering what i had seen

2140.16 --> 2148.16
was that mine was that my experience

2145.28 --> 2151.44
was it was suggested it was me because

2148.16 --> 2155.52
it was a cohesive non-stop experience

2151.44 --> 2158.0
but it was obviously grafted together

2155.52 --> 2159.68
so i've been just thinking my god how is

2158.0 --> 2162.96
this even possible

2159.68 --> 2166.64
they literally created a giant illusion

2162.96 --> 2170.079
from an interdimensional tape

2166.64 --> 2172.96
station or something of like everybody's

2170.079 --> 2173.92
experience in the entire history of

2172.96 --> 2177.28
mankind

2173.92 --> 2178.4
and they just plucked yeah who is this

2177.28 --> 2181.6800000000003
who is this

2178.4 --> 2185.04
the akashic librarians

2181.68 --> 2186.0
demons hariman i don't know man i don't

2185.04 --> 2188.96
get it i don't

2186.0 --> 2190.0
understand what the [ __ ] happened but

2188.96 --> 2193.04
they built this

2190.0 --> 2195.28
thing together for me and i saw

2193.04 --> 2196.4
all kinds of representations that they

2195.28 --> 2198.6400000000003
used

2196.4 --> 2200.079
and that i later recognized from was

2198.64 --> 2202.72
seeing things

2200.079 --> 2204.7200000000003
on videos and [ __ ] and it's just like oh

2202.72 --> 2206.9599999999996
my god

2204.72 --> 2208.9599999999996
it's all grafted together from all of

2206.96 --> 2211.28
this

2208.96 --> 2214.2400000000002
but also just personal to person

2211.28 --> 2218.4
experiences how is this possible and

2214.24 --> 2220.24
i thought it was me but it wasn't

2218.4 --> 2222.32
and it later it didn't make sense it was

2220.24 --> 2225.1189999999997
me it was like okay i feel like my

2222.32 --> 2227.599
spirit is unstuck in time and i'm just

2225.119 --> 2228.96
weirdly trying to survive in this spirit

2227.599 --> 2231.2000000000003
form

2228.96 --> 2232.7200000000003
that was kind of the the feeling that it

2231.2 --> 2235.7599999999998
got made me so

2232.72 --> 2235.7599999999998
terribly desperate

2236.88 --> 2240.8
but because i thought that at the end of

2238.96 --> 2244.56
it i would die i thought they would

2240.8 --> 2247.76
kill me after i came out of it

2244.56 --> 2247.7599999999998
i really thought that

2248.079 --> 2251.6800000000003
but i didn't understand i did not know

2250.8 --> 2253.8390000000004
anything

2251.68 --> 2255.44
about what the hell was going i think

2253.839 --> 2258.72
i've been subjected to this

2255.44 --> 2260.56
massive high level halo synergetic

2258.72 --> 2263.839
ritual or something

2260.56 --> 2266.56
just by the substance

2263.839 --> 2268.24
of a specific type it's not just regular

2266.56 --> 2270.64
ayahuasca you can meet yourself from

2268.24 --> 2274.0789999999997
some random stupid cacti or something

2270.64 --> 2277.2
no no this was something else and

2274.079 --> 2278.32
i literally it's like oh yeah yeah oh

2277.2 --> 2281.4399999999996
okay here's a

2278.32 --> 2284.32
newbie okay you're gonna get the the the

2281.44 --> 2287.2000000000003
arc druid level initiation

2284.32 --> 2289.839
literally completely unknowing that's

2287.2 --> 2292.7999999999997
kind of what i feel happened to me

2289.839 --> 2293.119
like what the [ __ ] man i was subjected

2292.8 --> 2296.96
to

2293.119 --> 2299.6800000000003
such heavy [ __ ] that was crazy

2296.96 --> 2301.44
but then again also i was foolishly

2299.68 --> 2303.52
eager so i did kind of

2301.44 --> 2304.96
call it over myself literally not

2303.52 --> 2305.839
understanding what the [ __ ] i was doing

2304.96 --> 2307.52
i was just

2305.839 --> 2308.96
lighting up that torch like yeah

2307.52 --> 2311.839
brighter man brighter

2308.96 --> 2313.599
ah i'm on fire now that's that's kind of

2311.839 --> 2318.48
what happened to me

2313.599 --> 2322.4
in my late teens yeah so yeah prometheus

2318.48 --> 2324.96
situation i almost set myself on fire

2322.4 --> 2326.48
in my spirit i almost completely burned

2324.96 --> 2328.32
myself up

2326.48 --> 2329.76
and i think that's probably what happens

2328.32 --> 2330.8
to more people and i think that they

2329.76 --> 2334.0
even

2330.8 --> 2336.88
intend for that to happen for some weird

2334.0 --> 2339.119
freaky mystical reason

2336.88 --> 2340.2400000000002
because people like me with too much

2339.119 --> 2342.6400000000003
spirit are

2340.24 --> 2343.839
incredibly dangerous to the stability of

2342.64 --> 2346.8799999999997
the spirit world

2343.839 --> 2348.32
and especially the control of the spirit

2346.88 --> 2350.56
world

2348.32 --> 2352.56
so i feel like i am like one of the

2350.56 --> 2354.48
number one enemies

2352.56 --> 2356.96
of all the darkness in the world now

2354.48 --> 2357.68
that's ooh secret king right who's so

2356.96 --> 2361.359
dramatic

2357.68 --> 2365.7599999999998
well what about just

2361.359 --> 2368.7999999999997
the experience aren't we technically

2365.76 --> 2372.0
all we're just too stressed

2368.8 --> 2375.04
out too overwhelmed too timid

2372.0 --> 2378.72
too modest to handle

2375.04 --> 2384.56
realizing that you are when you realize

2378.72 --> 2386.9599999999996
that you are and i realize that i am

2384.56 --> 2387.68
so who else is going to realize that

2386.96 --> 2392.7200000000003
they are

2387.68 --> 2392.72
the number one enemy of the darkness

2393.839 --> 2397.359
how many of you dare to actually go

2396.0 --> 2399.28
there actually go

2397.359 --> 2400.64
over those last thresholds where you

2399.28 --> 2403.0400000000004
thought no no no

2400.64 --> 2404.48
not this come on this is not reasonable

2403.04 --> 2408.64
you can't do that everybody

2404.48 --> 2413.359
no no everything everything all the way

2408.64 --> 2415.44
no holds still natural law applies

2413.359 --> 2416.7999999999997
and that seems to be a keystone natural

2415.44 --> 2419.76
law natural law is

2416.8 --> 2421.3590000000004
everything i think that every law every

2419.76 --> 2424.88
law religious

2421.359 --> 2428.7999999999997
state seafair

2424.88 --> 2433.04
can all be jettisoned and natural law

2428.8 --> 2436.48
is the only thing that is actually real

2433.04 --> 2438.64
that's what i feel no they're not

2436.48 --> 2440.079
clockwork elves i i have seen them at

2438.64 --> 2442.319
times but they are just

2440.079 --> 2444.6400000000003
clockwork elves are literally a side

2442.319 --> 2447.68
effect they're not entities

2444.64 --> 2450.8799999999997
they're hallucinogenic personifications

2447.68 --> 2453.1189999999997
of energy mechanisms

2450.88 --> 2454.8
you understand clockwork gnomes and

2453.119 --> 2456.56
things that's in a very typical

2454.8 --> 2458.8
hallucinatory state

2456.56 --> 2460.7999999999997
that's literally mind personification of

2458.8 --> 2467.6800000000003
energy and the energy is real

2460.8 --> 2469.599
it's just not really what you're seeing

2467.68 --> 2471.2799999999997
yeah poke urine well you believe the

2469.599 --> 2474.2400000000002
earth is concave so that doesn't

2471.28 --> 2474.2400000000002
surprise me at all

2478.24 --> 2483.359
you had a friend set in fire oh yes

2481.76 --> 2485.599
yeah in this case i was being

2483.359 --> 2488.24
metaphorical damn

2485.599 --> 2488.2400000000002
get out of there

2488.96 --> 2493.28
so i'm never forgetting this is called

2491.119 --> 2494.8
rusk ever again man i had so much

2493.28 --> 2496.4
trouble remembering that it's actually

2494.8 --> 2499.119
called rusk i have to look it up like

2496.4 --> 2499.119
six times

2499.2 --> 2501.9199999999996
it's rusk

2508.96 --> 2511.92
oh lizard people

2513.2 --> 2520.16
lizard people lizard spirit or

2517.24 --> 2523.52
lizardification of human

2520.16 --> 2526.16
which one did you see

2523.52 --> 2528.0
because there is like lizard spirits

2526.16 --> 2528.64
which are very similar to clockwork

2528.0 --> 2530.319
elves

2528.64 --> 2533.04
very similar it's just a different

2530.319 --> 2534.88
region actually it's regional bound

2533.04 --> 2536.16
it's not fascinating energies are

2534.88 --> 2538.8
different per region

2536.16 --> 2540.72
and so the hallucinogenic manifestations

2538.8 --> 2544.0
coming forth from these specific

2540.72 --> 2546.2799999999997
regional attuned energies also

2544.0 --> 2547.92
tend to display other types of

2546.28 --> 2552.1600000000003
hallucinogenics

2547.92 --> 2554.319
isn't that just absolutely fascinating

2552.16 --> 2555.52
right so have you seen lizard spirits or

2554.319 --> 2560.4
did you actually see

2555.52 --> 2562.88
like full-blown lizard spirit entities

2560.4 --> 2565.76
that you could like really communicate

2562.88 --> 2568.8
with

2565.76 --> 2572.8
and that like showed to be like living

2568.8 --> 2578.0
like procreation

2572.8 --> 2593.8390000000004
consumption all that

2578.0 --> 2593.839
what did you see brady

2597.52 --> 2601.52
oh it's all joking around again is it

2604.22 --> 2608.0
[Applause]

2605.52 --> 2608.96
okay i'll stop trying to piss everybody

2608.0 --> 2611.28
off but

2608.96 --> 2612.079
i'm this is not joking to me at all i'm

2611.28 --> 2615.119
not

2612.079 --> 2617.6800000000003
being funny everything i said is

2615.119 --> 2618.56
absolutely dead serious it's not a

2617.68 --> 2621.839
[ __ ] joke

2618.56 --> 2621.839
just so you know

2634.16 --> 2640.0789999999997
wrong you know who came up with that

2637.28 --> 2645.119
george sanford

2640.079 --> 2645.119
evolutionist so absolute [ __ ]

2646.839 --> 2649.839
[ __ ]

2650.16 --> 2655.2799999999997
it's not true just because they call it

2653.359 --> 2658.0789999999997
even the reptilian part of the brain is

2655.28 --> 2658.079
just nonsense

2661.28 --> 2665.119
it didn't develop it didn't grow

2663.44 --> 2668.079
gradually to become that

2665.119 --> 2671.44
no it's another design we have other

2668.079 --> 2674.8
elements to us yes of course we have a

2671.44 --> 2677.839
standard reflex system that's nothing to

2674.8 --> 2677.8390000000004
do with lizards

2678.88 --> 2683.6800000000003
i i yeah i just don't like that idea

2681.839 --> 2686.72
it's like a cultural trope that's just

2683.68 --> 2689.68
wrong it's just another evolution

2686.72 --> 2691.839
placement word placement to confuse us

2689.68 --> 2691.839
again

2701.44 --> 2706.16
people face shape into lizard-like

2704.319 --> 2709.599
structure yes ready

2706.16 --> 2709.5989999999997
yes i can imagine

2713.599 --> 2721.599
of other animal spirits uh

2719.2 --> 2723.04
i think that potentially everything

2721.599 --> 2726.079
absolutely everything even

2723.04 --> 2727.359
rock sounds ridiculous right every form

2726.079 --> 2730.4
of spirit

2727.359 --> 2732.96
is recycled everything now does it

2730.4 --> 2734.56
reincarnate as the same is reincarnation

2732.96 --> 2737.839
being the same

2734.56 --> 2740.24
i don't think so and

2737.839 --> 2741.7599999999998
who's to say the thing is if

2740.24 --> 2744.64
reincarnation is there

2741.76 --> 2745.5200000000004
you'll find it out there's absolutely no

2744.64 --> 2748.72
relevance

2745.52 --> 2748.72
to it whatsoever

2749.28 --> 2751.6800000000003
to me

2752.4 --> 2758.1600000000003
because the only idea i don't know like

2755.76 --> 2760.88
oh yeah your spirit is eternal that way

2758.16 --> 2763.2
or this way or

2760.88 --> 2765.6800000000003
like what is the only point to even

2763.2 --> 2765.68
thinking

2767.04 --> 2771.04
like that you yeah that you wouldn't be

2769.44 --> 2772.88
reincarnated

2771.04 --> 2774.24
like does it matter when you're dead

2772.88 --> 2776.8
physically you're dead

2774.24 --> 2777.2799999999997
that that thing that you are you were

2776.8 --> 2779.52
that's

2777.28 --> 2781.52
never gonna come back that's gone

2779.52 --> 2784.24
forever

2781.52 --> 2785.68
so does it really matter does it matter

2784.24 --> 2788.72
when you're dead you're dead

2785.68 --> 2790.8799999999997
it's over and hey if you come back good

2788.72 --> 2792.0789999999997
good on the world if you're a great guy

2790.88 --> 2794.56
or girl

2792.079 --> 2795.8390000000004
or if a dick will [ __ ] come back you

2794.56 --> 2798.96
know

2795.839 --> 2801.04
you don't know does it matter not really

2798.96 --> 2802.079
there's already too many shitty people

2801.04 --> 2804.88
and too many

2802.079 --> 2806.6400000000003
cool people too that it doesn't really

2804.88 --> 2808.56
matter anymore

2806.64 --> 2810.4
you can't control it you can't control

2808.56 --> 2812.16
reincarnation

2810.4 --> 2813.599
or maybe if you're the dalai lama if you

2812.16 --> 2816.8799999999997
believe that

2813.599 --> 2818.6400000000003
i i can't say i don't think that that is

2816.88 --> 2820.48
what it is i think that if anything the

2818.64 --> 2823.44
dalai lama gets

2820.48 --> 2824.0
well maybe like this weird yeah what i

2823.44 --> 2826.2400000000002
said

2824.0 --> 2827.52
this weird memory from other people

2826.24 --> 2829.7599999999998
implantation

2827.52 --> 2832.8
doesn't mean that he is that person he

2829.76 --> 2834.8
just gets the memories of that person

2832.8 --> 2836.0
okay that's very it's an alternative

2834.8 --> 2839.599
explanation that i

2836.0 --> 2841.76
literally now literally now this second

2839.599 --> 2843.52
figured out i didn't think of that

2841.76 --> 2846.079
before literally now

2843.52 --> 2846.88
comparing it to my own experience so did

2846.079 --> 2849.28
they just

2846.88 --> 2852.1600000000003
is that reincarnation receiving the

2849.28 --> 2855.44
memories of other peoples

2852.16 --> 2859.1189999999997
that are like bound to that thing

2855.44 --> 2860.96
you know to the dalai lama

2859.119 --> 2862.4
is he just receiving the memories of his

2860.96 --> 2864.8
predecessors

2862.4 --> 2866.64
or is it literally reincarnation it

2864.8 --> 2872.96
doesn't

2866.64 --> 2876.0789999999997
does it matter yes i got the shower

2872.96 --> 2876.079
fixed indeed i did

2876.319 --> 2879.599
i had to do it all myself

2881.63 --> 2884.659
[Music]

2884.96 --> 2888.16
when i still wasn't fully healthy but

2887.44 --> 2890.079
then again

2888.16 --> 2891.7599999999998
i had plenty of challenges to just go

2890.079 --> 2894.4
out and get stuff and

2891.76 --> 2896.7200000000003
i was very very active yesterday very

2894.4 --> 2896.7200000000003
active

2899.599 --> 2904.7200000000003
and uh yeah i got a completely new brand

2902.48 --> 2906.88
new great showers now so

2904.72 --> 2909.04
better than the one before even so

2906.88 --> 2910.8
actually that was kind of cool

2909.04 --> 2912.319
in retrospect like yeah i got a great

2910.8 --> 2913.76
shower now and because my landlord

2912.319 --> 2915.7599999999998
basically let me do it

2913.76 --> 2916.96
she said yeah you do give me the give me

2915.76 --> 2919.3590000000004
the

2916.96 --> 2920.88
the receipt i was like okay then i'll

2919.359 --> 2924.24
get the just the best

2920.88 --> 2927.28
thing there you go not to do the most

2924.24 --> 2929.839
expensive but just the best thing there

2927.28 --> 2930.6400000000003
for a price so yeah now i got that

2929.839 --> 2932.5589999999997
awesome

2930.64 --> 2934.0
didn't cost me a cent it only cost me a

2932.559 --> 2936.1600000000003
little effort and it was

2934.0 --> 2937.92
yeah i was actually kind of happy to be

2936.16 --> 2940.5589999999997
occupied because i got all this freaking

2937.92 --> 2940.559
energy now

2940.839 --> 2943.839
hmm

2957.28 --> 2962.079
well paul kiran maybe maybe it has

2959.359 --> 2964.96
something to do that i actually

2962.079 --> 2964.96
ate something

2965.2 --> 2968.8799999999997
that i actually drank two liters of

2967.04 --> 2972.0
bouillon

2968.88 --> 2975.2000000000003
for the first time in six days

2972.0 --> 2978.079
five days i think that might have

2975.2 --> 2978.0789999999997
something to do with it

2979.839 --> 2984.48
also i think that the the probiotics and

2982.72 --> 2987.04
the timing that i took it

2984.48 --> 2989.28
also did good it probably did help a

2987.04 --> 2989.2799999999997
little

2989.76 --> 2993.119
although again yeah my intestines didn't

2991.599 --> 2994.319
i didn't really have any trouble with

2993.119 --> 2998.8
them

2994.319 --> 3001.119
so but they probably also just help my

2998.8 --> 3001.119
stomach

3010.319 --> 3016.96
no crypto alert there is

3013.599 --> 3019.599
no that doesn't make any sense what is

3016.96 --> 3019.599
slavery

3020.48 --> 3027.839
what is slavery after death

3035.52 --> 3039.68
now it's simply if you literally abandon

3038.64 --> 3042.319
what you are

3039.68 --> 3043.359
then you will have nothing because you

3042.319 --> 3046.0
lost it all

3043.359 --> 3047.7599999999998
during life then you have nothing at the

3046.0 --> 3049.839
end

3047.76 --> 3051.28
if you actually held true to the

3049.839 --> 3054.16
purities and built

3051.28 --> 3056.7200000000003
then you have that you have what you are

3054.16 --> 3056.72
at the end

3057.68 --> 3062.3999999999996
and that is like that level of energy

3061.119 --> 3064.319
you build

3062.4 --> 3065.52
is the thing that will be available to

3064.319 --> 3068.64
your

3065.52 --> 3069.92
fantastical mega dream state which is

3068.64 --> 3072.96
heaven

3069.92 --> 3076.319
and and technically permanent

3072.96 --> 3078.079
but then again time is fluid it doesn't

3076.319 --> 3080.24
really matter anymore you can just do

3078.079 --> 3082.96
whatever you want will you do it however

3080.24 --> 3086.24
when it doesn't matter anymore see

3082.96 --> 3090.0
this is a complex introspective question

3086.24 --> 3090.0
that i've asked myself many times

3090.16 --> 3095.359
so that's like i think that people long

3092.559 --> 3097.119
for heaven when they are on earth

3095.359 --> 3099.2799999999997
and they are in heaven when they are in

3097.119 --> 3101.359
earth but when they die

3099.28 --> 3103.76
they let it all go it doesn't matter

3101.359 --> 3103.7599999999998
anymore

3104.72 --> 3107.839
if you've known heaven and you've known

3106.72 --> 3110.5589999999997
hell

3107.839 --> 3113.599
during your time on earth then at the

3110.559 --> 3115.599
end it doesn't really matter anymore

3113.599 --> 3117.76
and if it does then you'll probably have

3115.599 --> 3122.0
one final

3117.76 --> 3123.92
yeah final dream to resolve it all

3122.0 --> 3126.24
given to you by god through your pineal

3123.92 --> 3126.2400000000002
gland

3126.8 --> 3133.44
to resolve it to find that peace or

3130.24 --> 3134.0
be eternally tortured if that is really

3133.44 --> 3138.319
what you

3134.0 --> 3140.319
basically created for yourself

3138.319 --> 3141.359
if that is what you've held back like a

3140.319 --> 3143.2799999999997
lifetime of

3141.359 --> 3145.359
terror from the things that you've done

3143.28 --> 3147.0400000000004
on other people

3145.359 --> 3148.48
by holding that back now when you're

3147.04 --> 3151.359
gonna die that's

3148.48 --> 3152.0
all gonna face you and nothing's going

3151.359 --> 3154.16
to protect

3152.0 --> 3156.079
you you're all going to get it you're

3154.16 --> 3157.1189999999997
going to get every part of it and you're

3156.079 --> 3159.6800000000003
not going to be

3157.119 --> 3160.6400000000003
oh yeah but it was for good no no no

3159.68 --> 3163.68
nothing

3160.64 --> 3165.5989999999997
nothing will keep your feel

3163.68 --> 3168.16
and your gaze in every sense you have

3165.599 --> 3171.839
from feeling exactly what you did

3168.16 --> 3181.839
every [ __ ] thing so

3171.839 --> 3181.839
yeah good luck with that can't cheat god

3182.559 --> 3185.52
hey julio heaven

3186.4 --> 3190.96
[Music]

3188.64 --> 3190.96
okay

3193.119 --> 3195.839
all right

3197.599 --> 3202.559
well why would you have to would you

3200.48 --> 3204.96
have to have a heart attack

3202.559 --> 3206.0
was she kind of okay with it it all

3204.96 --> 3207.52
depends you know if

3206.0 --> 3209.28
look if you're an old person and you're

3207.52 --> 3210.16
getting like a heart attack too much old

3209.28 --> 3213.44
people's like oh

3210.16 --> 3215.92
there i go they're not like oh my god

3213.44 --> 3217.599
no not the end of my life because if you

3215.92 --> 3219.28
are like oh my god not the end of my

3217.599 --> 3221.119
life that's when your [ __ ] pineal

3219.28 --> 3222.96
glands start acting

3221.119 --> 3225.359
that's when you get the yeah that's when

3222.96 --> 3227.2
you get the heavy experiences

3225.359 --> 3228.96
that's why it always happens much more

3227.2 --> 3232.8799999999997
often to young people than it does to

3228.96 --> 3232.88
all people have you taken notice to that

3234.839 --> 3251.839
hmm

3237.44 --> 3251.839
right anyway load

3256.48 --> 3265.839
she was 40 hmm okay

3259.599 --> 3265.839
that's weird

3272.4 --> 3277.119
right by the way having your heart not

3275.119 --> 3278.799
beat for 10 minutes is technically not

3277.119 --> 3280.559
dead

3278.799 --> 3281.839
death is when your brain starts shut

3280.559 --> 3285.119
down

3281.839 --> 3286.72
that's really death it's also much

3285.119 --> 3288.559
harder to recover from

3286.72 --> 3290.16
usually people end up in comas when that

3288.559 --> 3292.48
happens

3290.16 --> 3294.72
so i'd say she wasn't technically dead

3292.48 --> 3294.72
then

3299.76 --> 3307.8390000000004
it doesn't always have to happen again

3302.16 --> 3307.839
it depends on the person

3318.839 --> 3321.839
so

3332.839 --> 3336.64
right

3334.05 --> 3338.88
[Music]

3336.64 --> 3341.2799999999997
well i would then by that said i would

3338.88 --> 3344.4
have to believe in an afterlife because

3341.28 --> 3346.559
half my living experience to me

3344.4 --> 3348.7200000000003
has been the dream world i've had so

3346.559 --> 3351.3590000000004
many lucid dreams

3348.72 --> 3351.359
intense

3352.559 --> 3357.0400000000004
i had a i didn't share that i think and

3355.44 --> 3359.68
i had a dream

3357.04 --> 3360.5589999999997
i forgot to share that on yesterday's

3359.68 --> 3363.9199999999996
show

3360.559 --> 3367.0400000000004
i had a dream about my old house

3363.92 --> 3369.119
from my mother from long ago where i

3367.04 --> 3373.7599999999998
lived with her my brother and my dad who

3369.119 --> 3376.96
later like yeah left

3373.76 --> 3378.0
and i was literally going through my

3376.96 --> 3380.96
papers

3378.0 --> 3383.359
like the ones i showed you remember with

3380.96 --> 3388.4
the building designs and things

3383.359 --> 3391.52
those and extra pages

3388.4 --> 3394.64
and these extra pages don't really exist

3391.52 --> 3395.359
but they were the same extra pages i had

3394.64 --> 3399.5989999999997
looked through

3395.359 --> 3402.0789999999997
in my dream previous times several times

3399.599 --> 3403.2000000000003
it's absolutely mind-boggling it's like

3402.079 --> 3405.6800000000003
wow look at these

3403.2 --> 3408.0
old literally existing in my dream dream

3405.68 --> 3411.359
pages that are exactly the same as like

3408.0 --> 3413.839
30 years ago isn't that amazing

3411.359 --> 3414.88
like exactly the same it like oh yeah

3413.839 --> 3418.0789999999997
that

3414.88 --> 3433.839
and it's not existing it's like

3418.079 --> 3433.8390000000004
wow unbelievable

3444.839 --> 3450.319
hmm

3447.76 --> 3450.3190000000004
yeah i got

3455.119 --> 3460.2400000000002
yeah i've got appetite back so who knows

3457.2 --> 3462.5589999999997
what i'm gonna

3460.24 --> 3464.16
let me chow down well i do know i'm

3462.559 --> 3468.3190000000004
gonna get my chicken broccoli

3464.16 --> 3468.319
in a few hours looking forward to that

3470.319 --> 3475.839
but even a bit of rusk tastes kind of

3472.799 --> 3475.839
good now

3479.359 --> 3483.04
i'm gonna add some drinking yogurt that

3481.68 --> 3489.04
i made myself

3483.04 --> 3503.839
with fresh fruit oh yeah huh

3489.04 --> 3503.839
licorice typical dutch

3522.559 --> 3530.0
surrounded by rady

3525.599 --> 3532.079
how do you know

3530.0 --> 3536.079
there's definitely no outer space that

3532.079 --> 3536.079
place only exists in the spirit realm

3541.359 --> 3544.88
and so do freaking planets but and then

3543.28 --> 3548.0
again

3544.88 --> 3549.599
that's where the originate the idea of

3548.0 --> 3551.2
heliocentria might have originally

3549.599 --> 3552.4
written in the originated form it might

3551.2 --> 3555.52
have literally been

3552.4 --> 3556.7200000000003
ideas based on the spiritual

3555.52 --> 3558.96
architecture

3556.72 --> 3560.5589999999997
of the cosmogeny of the spirit realm and

3558.96 --> 3564.0
the frequencies

3560.559 --> 3564.0
the hells in the heavens all that

3566.88 --> 3573.839
so yeah

3583.119 --> 3591.839

okay want to talk about flat earth

3780.839 --> 3797.839
technicals ask away

3804.72 --> 3807.75
[Music]

3824.079 --> 3827.9100000000003
oh by the way anybody see flat swords

3826.799 --> 3829.52
video

3827.91 --> 3834.319
[Music]

3829.52 --> 3834.319
in a video you uploaded what was it

3836.48 --> 3853.839
yeah this morning is really awesome i'll

3839.119 --> 3853.839
share it

3854.4 --> 3859.039
like he uses pretty awesome music too

3865.599 --> 3870.2400000000002
if we're in the middle of the night

3868.48 --> 3873.039
maybe not so much in the early morning

3870.24 --> 3873.0389999999998
when oh well

3878.839 --> 3881.839
hmm

3892.839 --> 3895.839
uh

3906.839 --> 3909.839
uh

3915.039 --> 3922.7990000000004
so ready what do you want me to explain

3918.799 --> 3926.559
an invisible dome no

3922.799 --> 3927.52
we don't know everybody loves to talk

3926.559 --> 3929.92
about a dome because

3927.52 --> 3930.96
then they can depict it then they can

3929.92 --> 3934.64
say oh it's

3930.96 --> 3936.16
this you don't know nobody in the

3934.64 --> 3940.48
[ __ ] world

3936.16 --> 3940.48
except for maybe a few weirdos

3940.559 --> 3944.1600000000003
that actually did real tests or

3942.319 --> 3947.2
something or sat on some

3944.16 --> 3950.0
super archaic data of an actual

3947.2 --> 3952.0789999999997
attempt to really like recordings of

3950.0 --> 3952.88
literally interacting physically with a

3952.079 --> 3955.52
dome

3952.88 --> 3957.52
or with a barrier yeah there's nobody in

3955.52 --> 3959.0389999999998
the [ __ ] world that really knows

3957.52 --> 3961.119
whether you think the earth is flatter

3959.039 --> 3964.48
around or whatever the [ __ ] you think

3961.119 --> 3967.359
nobody knows nobody knows there's only

3964.48 --> 3968.0
one thing we do know and that is gas

3967.359 --> 3971.119
pressure

3968.0 --> 3975.039
requires a container a specific

3971.119 --> 3978.079
specific limited volume

3975.039 --> 3981.119
right once you know that then you know

3978.079 --> 3984.88
this realm is contained

3981.119 --> 3987.119
it doesn't matter how just know it is

3984.88 --> 3988.4
because natural law there is gas

3987.119 --> 3990.799
pressure if it wasn't

3988.4 --> 3992.799
we would not have gas pressure there

3990.799 --> 3996.079
would not be anything so there has to be

3992.799 --> 3999.28
a limited volume

3996.079 --> 4001.6800000000003
after things cannot move so there is no

3999.28 --> 4005.28
volume beyond the limited volume

4001.68 --> 4006.16
whether that is tutu due to a barrier of

4005.28 --> 4009.119
some kind

4006.16 --> 4010.16
in some form which is out of our reach

4009.119 --> 4013.599
or

4010.16 --> 4016.64
due to space

4013.599 --> 4019.3590000000004
itself looping in on itself

4016.64 --> 4021.52
like a wormhole literally like a

4019.359 --> 4026.24
self-repeating portal

4021.52 --> 4026.24
and that is the space in which we exist

4026.319 --> 4031.0389999999998
and that is my conception of what the

4028.24 --> 4034.72
realm is like a looping rectangular

4031.039 --> 4037.28
realm it's literally a self-containing

4034.72 --> 4039.4399999999996
material space this is the space in

4037.28 --> 4042.6400000000003
which matter can exist

4039.44 --> 4045.839
there is no space or matter beyond

4042.64 --> 4047.0389999999998
this volume that is my conviction

4045.839 --> 4049.68
now there might be a lot of things

4047.039 --> 4052.7990000000004
beyond that but there is no

4049.68 --> 4056.0789999999997
material beyond it it's

4052.799 --> 4057.7599999999998
illogical there has to be a limited

4056.079 --> 4060.319
amount of volume

4057.76 --> 4062.3190000000004
and a limited amount of matter i don't

4060.319 --> 4065.2
know about the energy though

4062.319 --> 4067.359
this gets very complex with energy

4065.2 --> 4070.48
especially light

4067.359 --> 4074.319
but as for matter there is nothing

4070.48 --> 4077.839
beyond the volume that contains us

4074.319 --> 4077.839
this is absolute certainty

4116.839 --> 4119.839
oh

4129.199 --> 4133.839
wasn't that a lot quicker

4136.4 --> 4140.48
i've gotten the hang of it doing it

4138.799 --> 4142.4
quick

4140.48 --> 4143.599999999999
a vortex yeah if you like to call it but

4142.4 --> 4146.4
you have to realize that

4143.6 --> 4148.56
vortexes and all these things are all

4146.4 --> 4151.599999999999
devised

4148.56 --> 4153.759
within heliocentric fantasy

4151.6 --> 4155.120000000001
it's all mathematical conceptions to try

4153.759 --> 4158.64
and explain

4155.12 --> 4161.2789999999995
space and matter which do exist because

4158.64 --> 4165.279
we're here

4161.279 --> 4168.4800000000005
right so i'm basically taking it back

4165.279 --> 4172.2390000000005
taking the concepts back saying no this

4168.48 --> 4174.48
is what reality is and not all that

4172.239 --> 4176.799
other [ __ ] that you made up

4174.48 --> 4178.799
[ __ ] gravity [ __ ] it doesn't

4176.799 --> 4179.759
even exist it's not even a thing it's a

4178.799 --> 4181.839
concept

4179.759 --> 4183.839
it's not even a complete concept there

4181.839 --> 4186.5599999999995
is no way to even [ __ ] tell

4183.839 --> 4188.719
what it is it's just that people end up

4186.56 --> 4189.839000000001
believing it's the freaking newtonian

4188.719 --> 4192.159
gravity in the end

4189.839 --> 4193.199
because they have no answer to what it

4192.159 --> 4196.0
actually is

4193.199 --> 4198.159
it's just a bunch of sci-fi blabbering

4196.0 --> 4200.88
and conceptual models

4198.159 --> 4202.08
that nobody in the [ __ ] world

4200.88 --> 4206.0
understands how that

4202.08 --> 4210.48
actually ties into reality nobody does

4206.0 --> 4214.159
not even [ __ ] einstein himself

4210.48 --> 4217.599999999999
get it he didn't know

4214.159 --> 4220.48
how it actually

4217.6 --> 4221.1990000000005
was provable or tied into real it's all

4220.48 --> 4223.5199999999995
concept

4221.199 --> 4224.799999999999
all of it gravity is a concept it does

4223.52 --> 4227.52
not exist

4224.8 --> 4228.4800000000005
it's a reification fallacy it is not

4227.52 --> 4231.76
anything

4228.48 --> 4233.839999999999
magnetism is magnetism

4231.76 --> 4235.6
gravity doesn't exist magnetism is

4233.84 --> 4239.360000000001
magnetism

4235.6 --> 4243.4400000000005
now there is displacement going on

4239.36 --> 4246.719
vertically right well that's called

4243.44 --> 4247.678999999999
relative density or density density

4246.719 --> 4249.84
theory

4247.679 --> 4251.36
in physics they just call it density

4249.84 --> 4255.28
that's really what it is

4251.36 --> 4258.96
that's what has been scientifically

4255.28 --> 4262.159
with experiment proven to be the cause

4258.96 --> 4266.56
of the vertical displacement

4262.159 --> 4269.679
do you understand that is reality

4266.56 --> 4272.2390000000005
is no gravity gravity doesn't exist

4269.679 --> 4274.719
magnetism is not gravity magnetism is

4272.239 --> 4277.04
not relative density

4274.719 --> 4278.08
get your facts straight i'm sick of this

4277.04 --> 4280.239
discontortion

4278.08 --> 4281.6
stupidity how long have we been

4280.239 --> 4282.239
hammering on this with the flat earth

4281.6 --> 4287.1990000000005
debates

4282.239 --> 4289.599999999999
how long three years now

4287.199 --> 4291.839999999999
oh my god people how long does it take

4289.6 --> 4292.88
how long does it take for you to finally

4291.84 --> 4296.719
get

4292.88 --> 4298.8
how the way things really are and stop

4296.719 --> 4300.32
stop smearing all this [ __ ] like a bunch

4298.8 --> 4302.56
of kindergartens

4300.32 --> 4306.239
get it straight get it right get your

4302.56 --> 4306.2390000000005
exam right for [ __ ] sake

4313.36 --> 4316.639999999999
why does helium rise because it's less

4315.76 --> 4319.84
dense

4316.64 --> 4320.4800000000005
that's why it's less dense than the

4319.84 --> 4322.8
medium

4320.48 --> 4323.839999999999
it is in which will be other gases

4322.8 --> 4326.719
especially

4323.84 --> 4327.679
down to the ground other gases that are

4326.719 --> 4331.52
denser

4327.679 --> 4333.679
so that will cause the isolated gas

4331.52 --> 4334.96
if it is not con if it is contained that

4333.679 --> 4336.4800000000005
is because if it is not contained it's

4334.96 --> 4338.2390000000005
literally going to go in all directions

4336.48 --> 4340.879999999999
all directions

4338.239 --> 4342.0
just like that all directions right

4340.88 --> 4344.32
that's what always happens

4342.0 --> 4346.32
when gas is not contained if it is

4344.32 --> 4348.48
contained in some kind of balloon

4346.32 --> 4349.92
then the combined density of that

4348.48 --> 4350.718999999999
balloon which will be rubber or

4349.92 --> 4354.32
something

4350.719 --> 4357.6
and the helium will have

4354.32 --> 4360.719
a density factor relation with

4357.6 --> 4364.08
the medium it is in which will be oxygen

4360.719 --> 4365.44
nitrogen co2 you know all that works

4364.08 --> 4367.76
right that's down ground

4365.44 --> 4368.839999999999
well that combined is still denser than

4367.76 --> 4372.88
the balloon

4368.84 --> 4375.6
rubber and the helium inside of it

4372.88 --> 4377.12
volumetrically the volume of it right

4375.6 --> 4380.88
because that is what it is

4377.12 --> 4385.5199999999995
it's the density average

4380.88 --> 4388.96
which means the volume and the mass

4385.52 --> 4392.159000000001
combined that's the density versus

4388.96 --> 4395.679
the average volume

4392.159 --> 4396.239
density mass of the gases surrounding it

4395.679 --> 4399.28
that's

4396.239 --> 4400.5599999999995
relative density so it will go up if it

4399.28 --> 4402.5599999999995
is contained within

4400.56 --> 4404.080000000001
a container that will prevent it from

4402.56 --> 4406.79
expanding in all directions

4404.08 --> 4409.679
indiscriminately

4406.79 --> 4412.0
[Music]

4409.679 --> 4414.08
yeah we don't need to know what matter

4412.0 --> 4416.08
is and to know what it does

4414.08 --> 4418.48
it doesn't you don't need to know

4416.08 --> 4420.4
anything you just need to pay attention

4418.48 --> 4423.44
and learn how things work

4420.4 --> 4425.92
you don't need to know what it is

4423.44 --> 4427.44
stop getting into these introspective

4425.92 --> 4429.76
little getaway holes

4427.44 --> 4431.28
like a rabbit trail into nowhere digging

4429.76 --> 4433.6
your head in the sand

4431.28 --> 4436.5599999999995
like an ostrich thinking you're a rabbit

4433.6 --> 4439.280000000001
you're not a rabbit you're an ostrich

4436.56 --> 4440.96
you can't breed in a [ __ ] hole in the

4440.96 --> 4446.08
there

so stop thinking why why why

4446.08 --> 4450.64
no we just know it is we figured it out

4448.88 --> 4454.08
we know how it works

4450.64 --> 4457.12
get over it you'll never know

never never never

ever and you're 10 generations

4462.8 --> 4467.84
know

people will never know you can

4467.84 --> 4476.08
find out how it works okay

4472.0 --> 4478.56
get the [ __ ] over it to five-year-old

4476.08 --> 4479.28
get over it you will not know you will

4478.56 --> 4482.080000000001
only know

4479.28 --> 4483.12
how it works if you pay attention stop

4482.08 --> 4487.36
whining why

4483.12 --> 4490.719
why why doesn't matter why the [ __ ]

4487.36 --> 4493.12
it only matters you know how it works

4490.719 --> 4493.84
don't you get it that's science that's

4493.12 --> 4496.88
knowledge that's

4493.84 --> 4500.2390000000005
engineering that's actually controlling

4496.88 --> 4503.4400000000005
how things work by knowing but

4500.239 --> 4506.5599999999995
why why why why why why why why

4503.44 --> 4511.839999999999
why not it sounds wine wine wine wine

always does that every single time it's

his final trope

you'll never let go when directed

electrostatic blobly blows gravity i'm

4541.84 --> 4546.4800000000005
gonna call it gravity

no stop being a dumb boomer

it's not gravity gravity doesn't exist

it's a reification fallacy it's fiction

it's conceptual medium-based fiction

non-hypothesis

ancient theory it doesn't exist

there's only relative density that's

provably there

it's there

yeah magnetics are very very cute if you

4592.0 --> 4595.04
all

4592.239 --> 4596.239
presuppose the orientation of the

you don't know it's a disc i know you

love if it's a disc

4602.96 --> 4606.88
though the magnetics are so convenient

4605.12 --> 4610.4
then the models

4606.88 --> 4612.4800000000005
can play with my model of the model

4610.4 --> 4614.08
it's a reification fallacy you don't

4612.48 --> 4616.959999999999
know the earth is a disk

yourself

like a religious heart like a baller it

must be a disc because otherwise i can

absolutely nothing okay you did

something you tried

you're still doing it stop it stop

calling yourself a scientist

4667.52 --> 4673.679
scientists don't believe

scientists know the cause of an effect

black man dark matter right

dark matter is a concept do you even

it's invisible immeasurable

how can you even say i found it when it

you know why the thought is there

it has to be or their freaking gravity

4868.4 --> 4873.04
yeah i don't claim it is there it's just

4871.04 --> 4876.159
it has to be or everything is totally

4873.04 --> 4878.48
[ __ ] and hey

4876.159 --> 4881.12
it's not like the entire realm of

4878.48 --> 4884.48
science fiction has been addressing it

4881.12 --> 4885.92
for 40 years or more right so well

4884.48 --> 4889.28
they don't claim it's there it's just in

4885.92 --> 4893.12
all the freaking science fiction yeah

4889.28 --> 4895.44
sure let's get nitpicky on it

4893.12 --> 4895.44
huh

4899.36 --> 4903.839999999999
hey adam

4909.1 --> 4912.119000000001
[Music]

4915.199 --> 4921.44
yes dark matter is science fiction as is

4917.44 --> 4921.44
the rest of the entire heliocentric

4928.84 --> 4932.159000000001
fantasy

4930.08 --> 4933.92
in science fiction you're right yeah

4932.159 --> 4936.638999999999
yeah they talked about star trek

4933.92 --> 4938.4
addresses dark matter

4936.639 --> 4940.0
they actually had a place where dark

4938.4 --> 4942.239
matter was so thick

4940.0 --> 4943.28
at some point in star trek voyager that

4942.239 --> 4945.199
they would crash

4943.28 --> 4947.36
into it it would destroy distort their

4945.199 --> 4949.678999999999
warp fields very dangerous yeah yeah

4947.36 --> 4953.199
dark matter is in science fiction

4949.679 --> 4955.36
not just books in literally mainstream

4953.199 --> 4958.159
series that everybody in the freaking

4955.36 --> 4960.08
world knows yeah

4958.159 --> 4963.28
dark matter in science fiction maybe you

4960.08 --> 4963.28
should pay some attention

4964.0 --> 4973.84
pay attention to the world you're living

4965.679 --> 4973.84
in man

4982.159 --> 4986.159
yeah hey adam yeah i'm doing great i'm

4984.96 --> 4989.76
eating

4986.159 --> 4991.679999999999
a lot of rusk i tried some

4989.76 --> 4994.859
yogurt

4991.68 --> 4994.859
[Music]

4995.52 --> 5000.159000000001
with some fruit yogurt was great fruit

4997.679 --> 5003.04
not so much

5000.159 --> 5003.04
lots of bouyon

5012.4 --> 5015.679
you lose still love that [ __ ] i still do

5014.639 --> 5017.6
i still like it

5015.679 --> 5020.08
i just don't really like the new series

5017.6 --> 5020.08
too much

5020.159 --> 5023.44
i still like the old series it's still a

5022.48 --> 5027.44
science fiction

5023.44 --> 5031.919999999999
storytelling medium and i really liked

5027.44 --> 5031.919999999999
well they also just paid attention to

5032.32 --> 5040.48
just modernizing technically updating

5037.12 --> 5042.48
modulizing industry

5040.48 --> 5044.0
and i found that part extremely

5042.48 --> 5045.839999999999
fascinating especially that started

5044.0 --> 5048.4
really in star trek voyager where they

5045.84 --> 5052.159000000001
really start to systemize

5048.4 --> 5056.719
how it works and i like that picard

5052.159 --> 5058.799999999999
you thought picard was good

5056.719 --> 5071.84
god i didn't even finish watching that i

5058.8 --> 5071.84
thought it was horrific

5077.6 --> 5082.400000000001
that old git this time is gone he's a

5080.239 --> 5084.4
[ __ ] demon now

then i'll have to hurry hmm

5222.84 --> 5225.84
hmm

5231.41 --> 5234.58
[Music]

5236.48 --> 5240.08
farscape what is that what is that again

5239.76 --> 5241.679
that

5240.08 --> 5243.5199999999995
that's another science fiction series

5241.679 --> 5244.88
right it's been a while i said again

5243.52 --> 5248.400000000001
like

5244.88 --> 5253.84
is that the one with the really awesome

5248.4 --> 5253.839999999999
intro soundtrack

5256.4 --> 5261.04
australian american yes yes it was that

5259.76 --> 5263.92
one yeah yeah

5261.04 --> 5264.88
with the with the weird dwarf character

5263.92 --> 5266.639
and

5264.88 --> 5268.08
yeah i thought that season was pretty

5266.639 --> 5273.679
awesome too

5268.08 --> 5273.679
that a really interesting anime too

5273.92 --> 5279.36
like a darth vaderish

5276.96 --> 5280.56
skeletor figure but it was really well

5279.36 --> 5283.36
done

5280.56 --> 5286.320000000001
very impressive i remember it's been a

5283.36 --> 5288.639
long time since i've seen that

5286.32 --> 5289.759999999999
yeah it's it's registered as aussie

5288.639 --> 5292.88
american so

5289.76 --> 5309.84
don't be too happy about it

5292.88 --> 5309.84
unless that's a wiki error

5310.32 --> 5316.639
yeah that's very cute paul kiran but

5313.48 --> 5317.36
heliocentrism was there way before the

5316.639 --> 5321.1990000000005
big thing

5317.36 --> 5325.5199999999995
big bang right big bang is 60s

5321.199 --> 5325.5199999999995
you know that right 1960s

5327.92 --> 5332.159
it's not that old literally nobody

5330.719 --> 5335.04
conceived it

5332.159 --> 5335.839999999999
before that's like oh the original atom

5335.04 --> 5339.36
theory

5335.84 --> 5339.360000000001
just people didn't bother with it

5339.44 --> 5344.08
heliocentrism has been there for a long

5341.679 --> 5345.76
long time because it's very easy

5344.08 --> 5347.679
because all you have to do is basically

5345.76 --> 5349.679
reify those lights in the sky

5347.679 --> 5351.92
into physical objects like a bunch of

5349.679 --> 5355.679
balls and then you can play with that so

5351.92 --> 5358.4800000000005
that's been around for a very long time

5355.679 --> 5358.4800000000005
the big bang

5362.84 --> 5367.52
no

5365.12 --> 5368.32
big bang is roughly the same age as my

5367.52 --> 5371.280000000001
dad

5368.32 --> 5371.28
so no

5376.84 --> 5379.84
um

5391.04 --> 5394.8
all right yeah zapped happy you're right

5393.12 --> 5397.719
big bang theory has absolutely nothing

5394.8 --> 5400.88
to do with heliocentric model it's just

5397.719 --> 5402.56
describing the solar system nothing else

5400.88 --> 5405.679
no evolution just the solar system yeah

5402.56 --> 5409.04
yeah just that giant reification fallacy

5405.679 --> 5411.92
with second law thermodynamics violation

5409.04 --> 5415.92
and ridiculous claim of how things could

5411.92 --> 5415.92
be in physical space yeah we know

5419.52 --> 5423.360000000001
just the big bang just makes it all more

5421.199 --> 5425.5199999999995
asinine that's it

5423.36 --> 5426.96
just throws more trouble on top of it

5425.52 --> 5430.400000000001
like oh really so

5426.96 --> 5432.88
if it can't really get to that well how

5430.4 --> 5434.159
did it came to that point of not being

5432.88 --> 5435.92
able to be that

5434.159 --> 5437.36
which we claim it is right now that's

5435.92 --> 5449.84
the big bang theory

5437.36 --> 5449.839999999999
absolutely ridiculous

5460.84 --> 5463.84
so

5467.36 --> 5469.599999999999
hmm

5470.639 --> 5476.08
all right anyway wow

5473.84 --> 5478.96
those 90 minutes have flown and i'm

5476.08 --> 5478.96
almost out of rusk

5484.48 --> 5490.4
did everybody else flee by now

5488.08 --> 5492.639
not hearing a lot of people except for

5490.4 --> 5495.679
zepty paul curran and here we go again

5492.639 --> 5497.52
anybody else still in here are you

5495.679 --> 5501.6
actually enjoying me

5497.52 --> 5505.84
being very loud and quick and witty

5501.6 --> 5505.84
because i am i'm very sharp i know i am

5506.48 --> 5510.239
is anybody appreciating this because if

5508.719 --> 5511.52
everybody just keeps silent i just get

5510.239 --> 5514.0
the feeling i'm

5511.52 --> 5516.8
yeah chasing you all away by being too

5514.0 --> 5516.8
violent okay

5517.76 --> 5519.84
so

5521.76 --> 5528.639
excellent show okay thanks

5524.96 --> 5528.639
you enjoy my rants okay cool

5530.48 --> 5537.299999999999
don't pacify please because of it

5533.13 --> 5537.3
[Music]

5541.52 --> 5545.4400000000005
oh yeah that's a good one julio pavin

5544.4 --> 5547.92
just wondering

5545.44 --> 5548.48
what is your take on a full visible moon

5547.92 --> 5550.639
at night

5548.48 --> 5553.5199999999995
in a black sky with only a thin crease

5550.639 --> 5553.52
and lit up

5554.159 --> 5558.638999999999
what how is that oh wait you mean how do

5557.679 --> 5561.36
you see the

5558.639 --> 5562.88
dark side when it's still shimmering

5561.36 --> 5565.12
right

5562.88 --> 5566.4800000000005
yeah yeah how do you see it and why

5565.12 --> 5568.159
don't you see it the rest of the day

5566.48 --> 5570.159
yeah it makes no freaking sense why do

5568.159 --> 5571.92
you see it only when it's not perfectly

5570.159 --> 5575.36
black

5571.92 --> 5578.08
and yeah when it's how

5575.36 --> 5579.5199999999995
it doesn't make any sense to me i can

5578.08 --> 5584.48
think of a reason why

5579.52 --> 5586.8
it's lensing issues i don't know man

5584.48 --> 5588.32
i i don't yeah i don't think it's even a

5586.8 --> 5590.96
physical thing it's just

5588.32 --> 5594.96
a light apparition which does not abide

5590.96 --> 5598.639
standard rules of light apparitions

5594.96 --> 5601.199
because we can't even pinpoint a light

5598.639 --> 5603.04
source we can't even pinpoint where it's

5601.199 --> 5604.4
actually coming from we just know it

5603.04 --> 5606.719
manifests in specific

5604.4 --> 5608.239
angular relations in relation to the

5606.719 --> 5611.44
observer in a specific

5608.239 --> 5613.36
position on earth and that's it that's

5611.44 --> 5616.638999999999
the only thing we know about it

5613.36 --> 5617.5199999999995
so we can't figure out the lensing of a

5616.639 --> 5619.52
light

5617.52 --> 5620.96
which we can't even freaking trace the

5619.52 --> 5623.679
origin of

5620.96 --> 5623.679
so yeah

5629.12 --> 5634.719
earth shine oh sure

5632.239 --> 5634.718999999999
sure

5638.08 --> 5643.04
so why would that earth shine then not

5641.52 --> 5644.639
light up the dark side a little during

5643.04 --> 5647.199
the day

5644.639 --> 5648.88
when we are literally facing the sun and

5647.199 --> 5650.08
it should have the full reflective

5648.88 --> 5659.84
capability of this

5650.08 --> 5659.84
earth shine

5665.66 --> 5671.679
[Music]

5667.44 --> 5674.08
yeah here we go again yes but that's

5671.679 --> 5674.88
that's not because of lensing that's

5674.08 --> 5678.4
because of

5674.88 --> 5679.92
brain correction it's psychological

5678.4 --> 5681.44
what you're talking about black and

5679.92 --> 5683.28
white checkers floors

5681.44 --> 5685.199
join between black and white and kind of

5683.28 --> 5687.92
move yeah that's your mind

5685.199 --> 5688.719
trying to create order and what you're

5687.92 --> 5691.84
seeing

5688.719 --> 5694.719
to size up for you how

5691.84 --> 5696.96
it thinks your brain it will be the most

5694.719 --> 5699.6
hands

5696.96 --> 5700.8
handy usable to you straight so it's

5699.6 --> 5703.76
like

5700.8 --> 5705.119000000001
it's interpreting it strategically for

5703.76 --> 5708.0
you to engage with

5705.119 --> 5710.4
what it your subconscious brain part

5708.0 --> 5714.4
sizes it up for you

5710.4 --> 5716.799999999999
but since it is kind of yeah a natural

5714.4 --> 5719.36
that's also what zebras you why they

5716.8 --> 5721.119000000001
have it as a defense mechanism

5719.36 --> 5723.679
because it is optically kind of

5721.119 --> 5723.679
unnatural

5723.76 --> 5727.679
and then it yeah it typically creates

5726.48 --> 5731.28
aberrant

5727.679 --> 5743.84
conclusions so it will it will warp

5731.28 --> 5743.84
in your eyes if you focus on it

5744.08 --> 5746.8
oh so good

5750.639 --> 5758.96
no no that's not how it works

5756.159 --> 5760.5599999999995
now the circle is not even relevant it's

5758.96 --> 5763.199
literally visible it's visible on a

5760.56 --> 5766.639
camera too

5763.199 --> 5769.919999999999
the dark side is visible on camera

5766.639 --> 5770.96
when it is in yeah it is just not

5769.92 --> 5774.159
perfectly black

5770.96 --> 5776.4
stay the light outside

5774.159 --> 5777.92
when it's not perfectly dark then you on

5776.4 --> 5779.759999999999
the camera will pick it up too that's

5777.92 --> 5781.36
not psychological that's not your brain

5779.76 --> 5784.88
doing that that's literally

5781.36 --> 5788.5599999999995
the light the dark side is

5784.88 --> 5791.36
visibly there in this specific moment

5788.56 --> 5793.1990000000005
of the day it's true because cameras

5791.36 --> 5795.44
pick it up too and cameras don't have

5793.199 --> 5797.36
yeah auto yeah psychological uh

5795.44 --> 5799.839999999999
strategical autocorrect for you

5797.36 --> 5799.839999999999
so

5801.94 --> 5804.99
[Music]

5812.96 --> 5816.08
by the stars twinkle players do not oh

5815.199 --> 5818.08
god

5816.08 --> 5820.4
well certainly not because of the

5818.08 --> 5822.08
[ __ ] reasons

5820.4 --> 5824.839999999999
that we would get to hear from

5822.08 --> 5826.639
heliocentrist which is absolutely

5824.84 --> 5830.88
ridiculous

5826.639 --> 5831.84
why nathan thompson says it's because

5830.88 --> 5833.6
it's going through

5831.84 --> 5835.6
water through light look he's shining

5833.6 --> 5837.1990000000005
water through light so that means it

5835.6 --> 5838.639
kind of looks like that so it must be

5837.199 --> 5841.919999999999
that

5838.639 --> 5843.36
correlations is not causation right so

5841.92 --> 5847.1990000000005
yeah what i could say is

5843.36 --> 5851.04
okay stars the angular

5847.199 --> 5854.4
size of the light apparition of stars

5851.04 --> 5855.6
is always always smaller than every

5854.4 --> 5858.48
planet

5855.6 --> 5859.280000000001
sighting every planetary sighting it's

5858.48 --> 5861.919999999999
just the name

5859.28 --> 5863.36
wandering stars the specific ones

5861.92 --> 5865.1990000000005
they're always

5863.36 --> 5867.5199999999995
they always have a way bigger angular

5865.199 --> 5871.919999999999
size than any star

5867.52 --> 5874.88
so it might have to do with angular size

5871.92 --> 5876.159
that because it is the specific

5874.88 --> 5878.32
smallness

5876.159 --> 5881.04
not yeah the brightness is not even

5878.32 --> 5884.239
relevant just the angular size

5881.04 --> 5887.679
of the [ __ ] might be so small

5884.239 --> 5890.0
that we see it twinkle

5887.679 --> 5891.679
because it's not perfectly because

5890.0 --> 5894.239
literally both our eyes are

5891.679 --> 5895.04
not we don't we're not cyclops we don't

5894.239 --> 5897.04
see

5895.04 --> 5898.88
singular beams of light like that no we

5897.04 --> 5899.92
have two eyes to give us depth on the

5898.88 --> 5903.36
short run

5899.92 --> 5906.159
but they will also slightly efface

5903.36 --> 5906.48
any perfect straight beams as it were

5906.159 --> 5909.679
and

5906.48 --> 5910.638999999999
hey already said angular relations of

5909.679 --> 5913.4400000000005
the heavens are

5910.639 --> 5914.2390000000005
super specifically related to the

5913.44 --> 5917.199
position

5914.239 --> 5918.638999999999
of the observer on earth that includes

5917.199 --> 5921.199
each freaking eye

5918.639 --> 5922.88
a slightly different observer right so

5921.199 --> 5925.919999999999
if you see a twinkle

5922.88 --> 5926.56
it might be because the star is not

5925.92 --> 5929.679
perfectly

5926.56 --> 5933.280000000001
in phase for your site

5929.679 --> 5936.88
that's it's not the proven cause but

5933.28 --> 5939.679
it's my speculation about why

5936.88 --> 5941.36
and yeah you're not gonna see that with

5939.679 --> 5942.4
planets because their angular size are

5941.36 --> 5945.679
too big

5942.4 --> 5946.96
your eyes can face with that they're

5945.679 --> 5950.4
close enough

5946.96 --> 5952.32
to not have them twinkle maybe a whale

5950.4 --> 5954.159
man they probably couldn't even see it

5952.32 --> 5957.599999999999
but maybe a whale would see

5954.159 --> 5959.759999999999
the twinkling of planets too

5957.6 --> 5962.320000000001
right because their eyes are pretty damn

5959.76 --> 5965.76
far apart or an elephant

5962.32 --> 5968.799999999999
but yeah for us humans

5965.76 --> 5970.4800000000005
not so much that's my concept i can't

5968.8 --> 5971.679
even call it a theory but i think that

5970.48 --> 5974.799999999999
might be a part of it

5971.679 --> 5975.1990000000005
i relate it directly to the concept of

5974.8 --> 5977.119000000001
the

5975.199 --> 5978.638999999999
holographics of the heavens the

5977.119 --> 5981.5199999999995
celestial system

5978.639 --> 5982.96
which very specific angular relations to

5981.52 --> 5984.080000000001
the observer and the position on the

5982.96 --> 5988.4800000000005
earth

5984.08 --> 5988.48
and so i have a reason an explanation

5990.4 --> 5994.159
we close one eye will the twinkle go

5992.84 --> 5998.08
away

5994.159 --> 5998.08
that's a good point i don't know

5998.239 --> 6002.32
i guess that should happen then right

6006.159 --> 6011.44
or maybe it still goes in and out but

6009.44 --> 6013.44
when it goes in or out we'll still

6011.44 --> 6016.638999999999
determine on the specific angular

6013.44 --> 6019.199
relation of the observer anyway

6016.639 --> 6020.84
so i don't know and if it's yeah if that

6019.199 --> 6024.239
doesn't match

6020.84 --> 6025.52
anything then i just don't know i don't

6024.239 --> 6028.0
know dude

6025.52 --> 6029.6
i i don't even know how it's possible

6028.0 --> 6032.0
that there's light coming

6029.6 --> 6033.119000000001
from a non-object out there how the hell

6032.0 --> 6035.84
is that possible

6033.119 --> 6037.44
like isn't that more concerning than

6035.84 --> 6039.6
figure out why is it twinkling

6037.44 --> 6041.36
yeah of course we see it twinkling but

6039.6 --> 6042.400000000001
if you recognize what it actually is

6041.36 --> 6045.92
isn't that much more

6042.4 --> 6048.159
mind baffling like okay there's light

6045.92 --> 6050.0
visibly coming from that direction in a

6048.159 --> 6053.119
very specific

6050.0 --> 6055.84
regular order

6053.119 --> 6058.4
and we can't even trace where it's

6055.84 --> 6058.400000000001
coming from

6059.199 --> 6067.44
what the [ __ ]

6065.679 --> 6079.84
oh you could give me reasons could you

6067.44 --> 6079.839999999999
that's cute

6081.36 --> 6088.5599999999995
no that's nonsense happy

6085.36 --> 6090.0
stars also twinkle when it's absolutely

6088.56 --> 6093.360000000001
crystal clear

6090.0 --> 6095.28
in the clearest of desert nights

6093.36 --> 6097.28
so that's absolutely [ __ ] the

6095.28 --> 6097.759999999999
brighter the stars are the more visible

6097.28 --> 6101.599999999999
they are

6097.76 --> 6101.6
the more twinkly they also get

6102.8 --> 6108.88
so it's definitely not the dimming

6106.0 --> 6110.0
or obstruction of light planets can

6108.88 --> 6112.96
twinkle as well

6110.0 --> 6113.76
really that's the first time i'm hearing

6112.96 --> 6115.04
of that

6113.76 --> 6118.08
now you you got to show me a

6115.04 --> 6118.08
demonstration of that

6118.159 --> 6121.5199999999995
yeah i'm not letting you get away with

6119.52 --> 6122.400000000001
just stating that without some actual

6121.52 --> 6124.719
evidence

6122.4 --> 6127.5199999999995
i've never seen that i've never seen a

6124.719 --> 6127.52
planet twinkle

6128.96 --> 6135.84
and i've seen plenty of venus

6139.199 --> 6142.4
oh an example of an example that's just

6141.679 --> 6144.4800000000005
not true

6142.4 --> 6146.159
yeah that's great september i love your

6144.48 --> 6149.839999999999
examples that are just not true

6146.159 --> 6149.839999999999
that's great

6158.639 --> 6162.0
right but anyway i have definitely no

6161.6 --> 6164.719
solid

6162.0 --> 6166.719
answer for that i gave you a bit of

6164.719 --> 6168.08
speculation of the off phasing of the

6166.719 --> 6170.0
eyes and all that

6168.08 --> 6173.28
but in retrospect i don't even know if

6170.0 --> 6175.84
that makes any sense really

6173.28 --> 6177.44
especially if you're gonna say that was

6175.84 --> 6180.159000000001
my eye explanation spot on

6177.44 --> 6181.919999999999
oh really oh you're being sarcastic now

6180.159 --> 6183.119
you think you're a smart ass said that

6181.92 --> 6186.32
be

6183.119 --> 6186.32
you think you're being funny

6187.52 --> 6191.84
you think this is funny

6196.0 --> 6200.08
be careful with what you're going to say

6197.44 --> 6200.08
next buddy

6200.159 --> 6204.0
because i was being very serious i'm

6202.08 --> 6206.0
doing serious research here and i

6204.0 --> 6209.28
demand to be respected there's no more

6206.0 --> 6209.28
fooling around in this chat

6212.8 --> 6220.320000000001
this is not your hang around in cafe

6216.4 --> 6222.719
hour right understand

6220.32 --> 6224.0
this is school flat earth early bird

6222.719 --> 6225.76
channel is school

6224.0 --> 6228.4
you're here to pay attention and be

6225.76 --> 6228.400000000001
respectful

6229.52 --> 6235.4400000000005
and let me rant like a maniac whenever i

6233.04 --> 6235.44
need to

6235.6 --> 6247.84
that's the rules now

6250.159 --> 6254.48
and i already admitted that yeah i think

6252.239 --> 6257.119
that my own explanation which

6254.48 --> 6258.5599999999995
i've tried that before is probably not

6257.119 --> 6261.199
very viable

6258.56 --> 6263.6
but i have no real alternative because i

6261.199 --> 6266.879999999999
can even

6263.6 --> 6268.8
lay a groundwork claim as to where the

6266.88 --> 6270.4800000000005
light is actually coming from and how it

6268.8 --> 6273.679
is possible that light

6270.48 --> 6275.5199999999995
simply manifests without a physical

6273.679 --> 6278.32
pinpointable source

6275.52 --> 6279.040000000001
right that is the bigger mystery to me

6278.32 --> 6282.159
how that is

6279.04 --> 6284.48
even possible let alone why though some

6282.159 --> 6286.799999999999
of those lights twinkle

6284.48 --> 6288.08
how the hell should i know like how do

6286.8 --> 6289.679
how do you test

6288.08 --> 6291.679
yeah why does that like twinkle let's

6289.679 --> 6293.52
test it yeah but you can't use that you

6291.679 --> 6294.639
can't use a lamp you see because they're

6293.52 --> 6296.639
not lamps

6294.639 --> 6298.4800000000005
so you can't try that out yeah it's very

6296.639 --> 6300.96
cute you can get all effects with that

6298.48 --> 6302.159
but you can't use that because it's not

6300.96 --> 6305.44
coming from a source

6302.159 --> 6305.44
so how are you going to test it

6313.28 --> 6318.719
all right well septepi better pay

6316.239 --> 6318.718999999999
attention

6319.36 --> 6324.96
good you respect you i respect your

6323.119 --> 6325.719
ideas but they're silly to me oh well

6324.96 --> 6331.84
that's

6325.719 --> 6331.84
self-contradicting statement there

6332.56 --> 6336.320000000001
if you'd actually respect my ideas then

6334.719 --> 6338.4800000000005
you wouldn't think they're silly

6336.32 --> 6340.32
you might think i'd be wrong based on

6338.48 --> 6341.919999999999
certain arguments

6340.32 --> 6344.239
but you wouldn't say they were silly

6341.92 --> 6345.76
because i don't respect silly ideas

6344.239 --> 6349.199
when somebody has a silly idea i just

6345.76 --> 6353.280000000001
think it's lame and unproductive

6349.199 --> 6359.199
or wrong silly

6353.28 --> 6363.199
ideas that are silly are useless

6359.199 --> 6366.4
can't do anything with it can build can

6363.199 --> 6366.4
construct anything with it

6369.28 --> 6377.199
good do i have a telescope

6372.96 --> 6379.199
no i have a life okay that's not purely

6377.199 --> 6382.879999999999
fair statement because i don't really

6379.199 --> 6382.879999999999
have that much of a life but

6384.4 --> 6390.719
no i don't have a telescope

6387.84 --> 6392.32
i used to have a dnd player in my not

6390.719 --> 6394.4
this group the last one but the previous

6392.32 --> 6396.639
one that was really into astronomy

6394.4 --> 6396.638999999999
though

6396.88 --> 6400.2390000000005
he was also a vegan and i think he was

6398.96 --> 6404.4
also gay

6400.239 --> 6406.799999999999
but yeah he was into telescopes a lot

6404.4 --> 6410.32
and he got really sad-eyed when i told

6406.8 --> 6410.320000000001
him that i thought the earth was flat

6413.119 --> 6417.36
but he did listen though and he was also

6415.119 --> 6418.799999999999
very much into the lord of the rings

6417.36 --> 6422.4
but that's as far as it goes for

6418.8 --> 6424.8
telescopes nope no telescope

6422.4 --> 6426.96
i do have a p900 though but i barely use

6424.8 --> 6426.96
it

6427.28 --> 6432.32
especially because everybody it pisses

6429.92 --> 6435.84
off everybody that i don't use it

6432.32 --> 6437.44
that's why i don't use it right because

6435.84 --> 6438.8
randy gave it to me and then everybody

6437.44 --> 6441.28
thought oh now arwen's gonna

6438.8 --> 6442.0
go out all day long use that thing all

6441.28 --> 6446.08
day long well

6442.0 --> 6447.92
no no i'm not

6446.08 --> 6450.0
i did make a couple of cool shots with

6447.92 --> 6452.4800000000005
it

6450.0 --> 6454.32
but it kind of has a shitty battery and

6452.48 --> 6457.839999999999
i just have a lot of trouble working

6454.32 --> 6457.84
with it

6464.96 --> 6469.76
but it's still a good camera though and

6467.92 --> 6470.08
i understood absolutely guaranteed i

6469.76 --> 6471.679
will

6470.08 --> 6473.6
do things with it in the future

6471.679 --> 6475.04
somewhere if i'm gonna go someplace

6473.6 --> 6477.4400000000005
where it's gonna be interesting like

6475.04 --> 6478.159
let's say i would go to a city to film

6477.44 --> 6480.239
some

6478.159 --> 6483.119
super old building yeah damn well take

6480.239 --> 6485.839999999999
my p900 with me

6483.119 --> 6487.28
p900 is too heavy huh have you tried the

6485.84 --> 6491.6
p1000

6487.28 --> 6492.239
now that's heavy p 1000s are like twice

6491.6 --> 6494.639
the weight

6492.239 --> 6494.638999999999
at least

6495.6 --> 6499.84
yes i have a tripod

6503.52 --> 6506.96
but the problem also is yeah i don't

6505.199 --> 6510.4
really have a car

6506.96 --> 6512.4800000000005
so do i really want to yeah

6510.4 --> 6513.759999999999
carry all that [ __ ] with me when i go

6512.48 --> 6515.839999999999
somewhere you know

6513.76 --> 6518.639
if i had a car and i might have in the

6515.84 --> 6522.4800000000005
near future thanks to my company

6518.639 --> 6525.76
not google another company gti

6522.48 --> 6527.678999999999
i might have some really cheap rent car

6525.76 --> 6529.92
and then who knows what kind of

6527.679 --> 6532.159
opportunities will open up for me

6529.92 --> 6533.84
and i might just easily go everywhere

6532.159 --> 6536.239
even in the middle of the night

6533.84 --> 6537.04
to use my camera in good places i don't

6536.239 --> 6539.199
know

6537.04 --> 6542.639
we'll see anything can happen this year

6539.199 --> 6542.638999999999
this guy the next year i mean

6552.719 --> 6556.0
right well without a tripod a p900 is

6555.36 --> 6558.719
kind of

6556.0 --> 6560.0
just a big weight it's not that great if

6558.719 --> 6569.84
you don't have a good

6560.0 --> 6569.84
tripod for it

6574.159 --> 6578.5599999999995
what is a company gti it's a crypto

6577.04 --> 6581.119
company

6578.56 --> 6582.320000000001
that i've stuck with for six years and

6581.119 --> 6587.839999999999
have not invested

6582.32 --> 6587.84
in a single cent my dad has a lil

6588.96 --> 6594.88
and it's building stuff virtual stuff

6592.88 --> 6596.679
it's it's basically become some sort of

6594.88 --> 6600.0
a independent

6596.679 --> 6602.8
decentralized yeah

6600.0 --> 6603.199
investment financial investment system

6602.8 --> 6605.679
thing

6603.199 --> 6606.96
it's weird i don't understand it i just

6605.679 --> 6610.0
thought look i

6606.96 --> 6612.08
gotta try this because i'm not gonna

6610.0 --> 6613.36
lose anything from doing it lit

6612.08 --> 6616.32
literally and i need

6613.36 --> 6617.199
some option to get out of here

6616.32 --> 6619.44
financially

6617.199 --> 6622.96
at some point because i'm still right

6619.44 --> 6626.159
now living on social welfare

6622.96 --> 6627.92
and yeah i went out

6626.159 --> 6629.28
now of course at the same time i got

6627.92 --> 6631.599
this show and i got

6629.28 --> 6633.679
whoa a whole unexpected range of

6631.599 --> 6636.719
supporting

6633.679 --> 6637.28
visitors that donate to me and all that

6636.719 --> 6639.28

6637.28 --> 6641.119
really helps out well i didn't have that

6639.28 --> 6644.32

6645.36 --> 6649.92

6651.44 --> 6657.919999999999

6654.96 --> 6660.719
it's not a stock broken company nothing

6657.92 --> 6665.04
to do with that whatsoever

6660.719 --> 6668.56
it's different and i'm not gonna explain

6665.04 --> 6668.56
