seems to be less rainy still some clouds

101.36 --> 107.92
going around but also some nice blue

104.439 --> 107.91999999999999
spots with some

108.24 --> 113.52
sun the sun has been really

111.88 --> 117.67999999999999
nice

113.52 --> 121.039
so it's not not

117.68 --> 122.92
bad slightly more sunny

121.039 --> 126.799
slightly less

122.92 --> 130.039
windy than it has been the last few days

126.799 --> 130.03900000000002
look at that isn't that

141.4 --> 145.92000000000002
beautiful that looks amazing

151.08 --> 154.55
all

151.5 --> 154.55
[Music]

154.76 --> 160.159
right hello jug first in chat good to

158.519 --> 166.0
see

160.159 --> 166.0
you it is Sunday the 21st of April

166.8 --> 172.31900000000002
2024 I'm starting exactly on time how

169.959 --> 172.31900000000002
about

175.68 --> 181.48000000000002
that all

178.48 --> 186.67999999999998
right so hope you all are doing

181.48 --> 189.11999999999998
well I'm doing okay had a night all show

186.68 --> 191.84
yesterday and yeah even though it wasn't

189.12 --> 194.48000000000002
that long it was very intense

191.84 --> 199.159
and

194.48 --> 203.48
great lots of explaining my ideas

199.159 --> 205.72
and it's just a a great show nice energy

203.48 --> 208.439
I liked

205.72 --> 210.68
it Flats soid got in the chat and got

208.439 --> 214.959
all weird and trolly then I had to kick

210.68 --> 214.959
him out that was kind of

226.159 --> 231.35999999999999
unexpected

228.08 --> 235.48000000000002
right but uh yeah I might do that more

231.36 --> 237.20000000000002
often all depends I mean certainly for

235.48 --> 241.64
the energy level alone that was

237.2 --> 244.79899999999998
definitely worth it it was

241.64 --> 248.55999999999997
fun and afterward I hung around a bit

244.799 --> 252.28
with on Martin Le's stream just a bit

248.56 --> 252.28
goofy but I mean it's

257.199 --> 263.199
amicable right so yeah I got

260.68 --> 267.919
this new way of setting up the live

263.199 --> 267.91900000000004
streams pretty much under control

270.4 --> 276.63899999999995
and I think I'm I'll be doing this doing

273.52 --> 278.52
it this way from now on and hopefully uh

276.639 --> 280.8
yeah everybody will be able to benefit

278.52 --> 280.79999999999995
from

281.8 --> 287.36
that monthly thing or something yeah

284.44 --> 288.759
maybe jug maybe even weekly maybe I'm

287.36 --> 290.91900000000004
going to do that more often in the

288.759 --> 295.40000000000003
weekends I'm not

290.919 --> 295.4
sure how I'm going to rearrange

297.639 --> 303.0
things we'll see

300.44 --> 305.0
but for now like I'm I'm really more

303.0 --> 308.479
concerned about just like getting

305.0 --> 308.479
through this month and everything

309.96 --> 314.88
and getting my internet back to normal

312.84 --> 318.15999999999997
and then like trying to figure out like

314.88 --> 318.15999999999997
how to improve my

321.68 --> 328.0
situation ah you get a notification half

324.8 --> 332.28000000000003
an hour before it starts

328.0 --> 337.12
right yeah that that is an advantage I

332.28 --> 341.15999999999997
agree forgot about that right so

337.12 --> 344.12
yeah this is how I'm doing it and yeah

341.16 --> 344.12
hope you all enjoy

345.24 --> 349.88
that good time right

352.5 --> 355.629
[Music]

368.56 --> 374.72
uh right because I might be trying out

371.44 --> 374.71999999999997
all kinds of things out

376.08 --> 379.08
there

379.24 --> 382.24
cuz

382.759 --> 390.12
yeah seems like despite the channel

386.88 --> 393.88
doing fine

390.12 --> 397.24
it is still like yeah it's not really

393.88 --> 400.15999999999997
growing explosively in any

397.24 --> 402.8
direction and it's becoming on the long

400.16 --> 402.8
run just

403.639 --> 407.88
problematic because of my financial

408.319 --> 415.8
situation like I need to find a way to

413.12 --> 418.599
like grow out of

415.8 --> 421.919
this because I'm not going to like be

418.599 --> 423.639
able to just hang on doing it just for

421.919 --> 427.71999999999997
the sake of doing

423.639 --> 429.8
it but not for not forever at least I

427.72 --> 432.28000000000003
mean I definitely want to get to like

429.8 --> 435.68
the earra

432.28 --> 435.67999999999995
2000 but I

436.599 --> 443.639
mean I don't know maybe I'm just like

440.4 --> 446.56
pondering too much upon it because I am

443.639 --> 448.919
kind of feeble in this

446.56 --> 451.28000000000003
period and that doesn't exactly help

448.919 --> 454.28
makes everything look way more grim and

451.28 --> 457.19899999999996
everything but

454.28 --> 460.71999999999997
uh like I'm still thinking

457.199 --> 463.44
like I basically need to improve my

460.72 --> 467.759
living situation somehow

463.44 --> 469.52
and like potentially if all possible

467.759 --> 473.24
like get an

469.52 --> 476.84
apartment instead of just a

473.24 --> 479.039
room cuz like financially it's not

476.84 --> 482.479
really working out and I need to like

479.039 --> 485.08
some how manag to improve that situation

482.479 --> 487.44
but I mean there's no direct outlook for

485.08 --> 487.44
that at

488.919 --> 491.919
all

498.919 --> 503.0
unfortunately like not in my current

504.879 --> 511.24
predicament but uh I'm going to try to

507.56 --> 513.599
work as the jobs still not an option

511.24 --> 516.76
yeah it is an option party fish it is an

513.599 --> 519.0390000000001
option so you got any you got a job to

516.76 --> 519.039
offer

520.76 --> 525.959
me yeah I

523.399 --> 528.8
mean I know you're probably just trying

525.959 --> 532.3199999999999
to troll me

528.8 --> 534.4799999999999
but just telling me get a job like

532.32 --> 536.839
that's very cute you got you got one to

534.48 --> 536.839
offer

537.0 --> 543.6
me one that could actually help my

540.279 --> 543.6
benefit my financial

543.959 --> 548.92
situation

545.8 --> 552.959
right got a job to offer me then I'm

548.92 --> 557.24
willing to hear you out on that in

552.959 --> 557.2399999999999
private through Skype or whatever

557.72 --> 562.519
or and then sure but otherwise just

561.36 --> 566.36
telling

562.519 --> 571.36
me get a job or whatever is it it

566.36 --> 571.36
doesn't mean anything it's just nagging

578.92 --> 582.4799999999999
oh you're not an employer well

582.76 --> 590.48
then then maybe just don't say that then

587.2 --> 595.32
stop wasting my time party

590.48 --> 595.32
fish ever considered that

599.63 --> 602.769
[Music]

606.94 --> 610.019
[Music]

617.15 --> 625.04
[Music]

618.519 --> 625.04
Place yeah well I don't want to find one

629.56 --> 632.16
I'm doing

633.64 --> 639.639
this but I mean I think I'll be working

637.399 --> 639.639
on

643.399 --> 650.639
it yeah yeah it's very

646.839 --> 654.36
nice yeah so donate to my PayPal and

650.639 --> 655.639
make me doing this show financially

654.36 --> 660.2
worth

655.639 --> 660.2
it that that would help

664.24 --> 668.8
all right otherwise uh thanks for the

666.8 --> 672.7199999999999
advice but

668.8 --> 676.56
uh just stop

672.72 --> 679.9590000000001
okay the conversation is

676.56 --> 682.959
fine when I have a conversation that's

679.959 --> 687.76
cool don't tell me to get a job

682.959 --> 687.76
don't it's just no point

689.44 --> 694.36
right I'll be working on that all all

709.32 --> 716.0
myself right anyway I hope you enjoyed

712.16 --> 716.0
the uh the night ow show

716.88 --> 721.24
yesterday it was great

721.68 --> 730.3599999999999
and uh yeah I wish I could just do it to

726.36 --> 730.36
that level on this show right

730.56 --> 737.1199999999999
away yes party fish I get it now let's

733.88 --> 737.12
move on

772.24 --> 779.24
all right so yeah I got T coffee and

775.959 --> 782.1199999999999
Illuminati C on on standby

779.24 --> 783.36
I'm not super hungry right now so we can

782.12 --> 787.079
wait for a

783.36 --> 790.0790000000001
bit love to start a conversation

787.079 --> 790.079
though

796.69 --> 799.769
[Music]

802.399 --> 809.639
uh let's just hang around on Discord and

806.199 --> 811.4399999999999
the uh Earth Awakenings Channel that was

809.639 --> 816.72
kind of

811.44 --> 816.72
fun hearing people discuss things

849.079 --> 855.16
that's about Flat Earth or something

851.279 --> 855.16
yeah the Earth is flat

857.399 --> 862.32
definitely outer space is fake

871.199 --> 874.56
and the world seems kind of like a tough

873.36 --> 877.8000000000001
place right

874.56 --> 883.0
now I mean I've been keeping track and

877.8 --> 885.959
it's not just my slightly more feeble

883.0 --> 887.92
state that just things that are

885.959 --> 891.279
happening in politics are just getting

887.92 --> 891.279
really grim

899.6 --> 902.639
money is

902.92 --> 907.04
like just being

907.6 --> 913.88
thrown to the

911.04 --> 917.16
projects of the

913.88 --> 921.519
elitists and like

917.16 --> 923.0
blatant neglection of just the overall

921.519 --> 926.639
Financial

923.0 --> 929.04
decline of

926.639 --> 931.48
everybody it's just getting really

929.04 --> 935.519
seriously

931.48 --> 935.519
egregious in the Netherlands as

938.519 --> 945.16
well but not just the Netherlands it's

940.88 --> 945.16
in in more multiple countries

966.959 --> 969.959
that

990.399 --> 994.0
I just wonder like how long this is

992.279 --> 997.199
going to continue

994.0 --> 1000.079
on before everything just starts to

997.199 --> 1000.079
unravel at the

1003.279 --> 1009.959
seams like Society itself cuz it's just

1007.199 --> 1009.959
getting really

1017.839 --> 1021.8800000000001
tough for

1071.919 --> 1074.919
spe

1091.12 --> 1096.2399999999998
right but I mean yeah if you just want

1093.159 --> 1098.919
to talk about Flat Earth I

1096.24 --> 1100.679
mean I always wanted to say what's there

1098.919 --> 1103.159
to talk about but I mean there's plenty

1100.679 --> 1106.0800000000002
to talk about if there's some kind

1103.159 --> 1109.7600000000002
of discussion going on or if somebody

1106.08 --> 1111.9189999999999
has a question about it

1109.76 --> 1114.76
but I mean to me it's

1111.919 --> 1117.159
just very blatantly obvious that the

1114.76 --> 1117.1589999999999
Earth is

1120.64 --> 1126.0
flat and that a lot of things you get to

1124.76 --> 1129.24
learn in

1126.0 --> 1132.36
school that it is claimed to be physics

1129.24 --> 1134.84
is basically incorrect it's even

1132.36 --> 1136.799
admitted like for example about gravity

1134.84 --> 1140.0
Newtonian gravity they'll still teach it

1136.799 --> 1143.28
in school but at the same

1140.0 --> 1146.96
time they'll admit if you go to the

1143.28 --> 1146.96
university that it's basically

1147.0 --> 1154.24
outdated and if a school teaches it

1151.0 --> 1158.559
correctly they just call it Newtonian

1154.24 --> 1158.559
mechanics they won't claim it to be

1160.24 --> 1165.28
science

1162.28 --> 1165.28
right

1165.52 --> 1170.72
and there's just no evidence that the

1168.08 --> 1170.72
Earth is a ball

1173.72 --> 1176.96
like water Finds Its

1177.559 --> 1182.6789999999999
level can't have gas pressure without a

1180.0 --> 1184.52
container it violates Second Law

1182.679 --> 1187.76
thermodynamics so you can't have an

1184.52 --> 1189.9189999999999
outer space that is vast and then still

1187.76 --> 1193.72
have an open system

1189.919 --> 1200.039
here with gas pressure forming

1193.72 --> 1200.039
relatively stable like that can't work

1203.84 --> 1209.3999999999999
and the geometry of presupposed

1207.52 --> 1213.12
spherical Earth has already been

1209.4 --> 1216.3200000000002
violated plenty of times using

1213.12 --> 1218.9189999999999
observations to be able to yeah if you

1216.32 --> 1222.0
can see certain things at a distance

1218.919 --> 1224.0800000000002
without curvature of the presupposed

1222.0 --> 1230.559
spherical Earth blocking

1224.08 --> 1230.559
it then that geometry is just failed

1235.12 --> 1239.559
right I haven't heard anybody even say

1238.24 --> 1242.32
like something like terrestrial

1239.559 --> 1242.32
refraction in

1243.32 --> 1249.24
ages I wonder like have all the Ballers

1247.159 --> 1252.0390000000002
just

1249.24 --> 1254.559
gone have they all fallen asleep or

1252.039 --> 1258.2
become too occupied with their own

1254.559 --> 1259.76
trying to fix their own lives like a lot

1258.2 --> 1262.159
of people people probably out there

1259.76 --> 1266.08
because things in the world are getting

1262.159 --> 1270.0800000000002
worse financially

1266.08 --> 1273.3999999999999
societally people are

1270.08 --> 1274.9189999999999
getting more it's becoming more obvious

1273.4 --> 1277.76
that

1274.919 --> 1281.039
just people in control of governments

1277.76 --> 1283.4
are out of control and

1281.039 --> 1286.559
treacherous towards the

1283.4 --> 1289.5590000000002
people and they follow an

1286.559 --> 1292.24
ideology that basically makes them

1289.559 --> 1294.799
deprioritize the well-being of the

1292.24 --> 1297.48
people to the point

1294.799 --> 1302.1589999999999
where they will

1297.48 --> 1305.96
just roll Out programs that will

1302.159 --> 1309.0800000000002
knowingly deep up end up with the result

1305.96 --> 1312.3600000000001
of lower population

1309.08 --> 1315.32
depopulation through sheer

1312.36 --> 1317.7199999999998
Siege and social engineering

1315.32 --> 1320.36
tactics and yeah it might be that a lot

1317.72 --> 1323.159
of Ballers have that it's now caught up

1320.36 --> 1326.039
with them as well like yeah we

1323.159 --> 1329.44
uh we really don't have time to bicker

1326.039 --> 1331.559
about Flat Earth versus bow as much cuz

1329.44 --> 1334.159
I don't see them around as much like

1331.559 --> 1336.36
there's some of them out

1334.159 --> 1339.8400000000001
there

1336.36 --> 1344.1999999999998
but hey

1339.84 --> 1344.1999999999998
clutch what are you doing

1354.48 --> 1357.96
why you timing him

1362.799 --> 1367.4
out could you say hello

1372.32 --> 1377.84
perhaps anyway

1375.159 --> 1379.4
uh maybe that's part of the reason why

1377.84 --> 1382.9599999999998
globers

1379.4 --> 1382.96
don't really hang around as

1390.4 --> 1397.96
much do they still like hang around Flat

1394.559 --> 1400.799
Earth debate the same I mean I know

1397.96 --> 1403.799
there's like regulars anti flat earther

1400.799 --> 1407.4
regulars that do like like to hang

1403.799 --> 1409.44
around there and I have to say that I am

1407.4 --> 1411.3600000000001
kind of happy that

1409.44 --> 1413.3600000000001
they don't come rolling in all the time

1411.36 --> 1416.9189999999999
because they do give me a headache just

1413.36 --> 1420.6789999999999
with their tenacity and their

1416.919 --> 1420.679
stubborness it is kind of

1421.679 --> 1425.799
tiresome

1424.08 --> 1429.36
but

1425.799 --> 1431.6399999999999
yeah I think a lot of glob Believers out

1429.36 --> 1434.1589999999999
there in the world and on media social

1431.64 --> 1436.039
media they're figuring it out they're

1434.159 --> 1438.7990000000002
figuring out

1436.039 --> 1440.679
that that it's a belief that it is a

1438.799 --> 1444.36
religion I think they're really figuring

1440.679 --> 1449.52
it out subconsciously and they're not

1444.36 --> 1449.52
bragging as much as they used

1449.96 --> 1457.76
to oh okay clutch was by

1454.12 --> 1457.76
accident all right no

1459.679 --> 1464.48
worries good to have you in chat

1477.0 --> 1483.679
oh by the way

1479.2 --> 1483.679
clutch when are you going to do a show

1484.76 --> 1491.1589999999999
again hey carrots got banned good see

1487.44 --> 1491.159
you globers got

1492.799 --> 1497.279
bored

1494.44 --> 1499.679
maybe I mean they're not making any

1497.279 --> 1504.039
progress

1499.679 --> 1504.039
with their reasoning anymore much

1529.2 --> 1532.96
I mean the Earth is obviously

1533.0 --> 1541.159
flat and

1536.039 --> 1541.1589999999999
logically and historically recognized as

1545.279 --> 1553.52
flat in the ball Earth preet position is

1550.08 --> 1553.52
really really

1556.44 --> 1561.3600000000001
young yes party fish sh

1596.64 --> 1602.48
maybe not no it was just a 10sec time I

1599.559 --> 1604.76
would probably face you're still here so

1602.48 --> 1609.84
don't worry about

1604.76 --> 1609.84
it and it was accidental anyway

1615.97 --> 1619.13

2141.48 --> 2145.04
actually go to space

2146.119 --> 2149.119
right

2149.359 --> 2155.88
sure the alternative history if space

2152.599 --> 2155.88
were real

2156.64 --> 2165.0
yeah so basically that entire premise

2160.72 --> 2169.5989999999997
blames America for not going to space

2165.0 --> 2169.599
then for all of that not really

2171.599 --> 2175.599
happening ridiculous

2187.72 --> 2192.64
watch the video posted in

2189.64 --> 2192.64
Skype

2264.359 --> 2270.72
out it was a fun show very energetic

2267.72 --> 2270.72
great

2288.88 --> 2291.8
all right debatable

2293.0 --> 2297.839
D I'm sure they're not overtly blaming

2296.56 --> 2300.4
it's just

2297.839 --> 2302.72
that like none of that's actually

2300.4 --> 2306.599
happening none of

2302.72 --> 2307.7999999999997
it does not H yeah they might show you

2306.599 --> 2310.2000000000003
like oh that's happening in this

2307.8 --> 2313.599
alternative history well how about the

2310.2 --> 2313.5989999999997
real history there's nothing

2323.56 --> 2331.72
happening unless you want to include

2326.56 --> 2334.2799999999997
sending a Mars Rover in the '90s and

2331.72 --> 2338.16
that supposed helicopter

2334.28 --> 2341.2000000000003
thing but I mean people are are figuring

2338.16 --> 2341.2
out that it's all

2342.72 --> 2348.2799999999997
nonsense like that even if that's

2345.48 --> 2351.48
supposedly real that nothing is

2348.28 --> 2355.0400000000004
happening they're not taking it

2351.48 --> 2356.64
to NE they're not like none of those

2355.04 --> 2360.599
things are like

2356.64 --> 2362.92
tests to then when successful scale it

2360.599 --> 2364.2400000000002
up and really do something like it's

2362.92 --> 2368.079
just not

2364.24 --> 2371.839
happening why could that be well because

2368.079 --> 2374.079
it's fake that's why it can never really

2371.839 --> 2374.0789999999997
do

2388.48 --> 2395.4
it follow the Lander oh yeah there's a a

2392.96 --> 2397.68
car

2395.4 --> 2400.2000000000003
somewhere I think it was that they

2397.68 --> 2403.64
actually did that in Greenland not

2400.2 --> 2407.0
entirely sure or some other spot was

2403.64 --> 2407.0

5508.639 --> 5512.719
it's actually very good for my

5510.4 --> 5514.679
well-being it was very tough being a

5512.719 --> 5518.0
week without the internet

5514.679 --> 5521.56
because I couldn't do my show and I felt

5518.0 --> 5524.76
really cut off that was very bad for me

5521.56 --> 5528.88
yeah you don't get to judge that me

5524.76 --> 5532.119000000001
doing this show is bad for me it

5528.88 --> 5533.96
isn't I need doing this show for my

5532.119 --> 5537.88
mental

5533.96 --> 5540.76
health I just need to not take any more

5537.88 --> 5544.4800000000005
risks with trolls as I have I have kind

5540.76 --> 5546.4800000000005
of kept them out

5544.48 --> 5548.759999999999
consistently and it's been working out

5546.48 --> 5548.759999999999
just

5563.56 --> 5569.360000000001
fine de you're so freaking funny

5576.6 --> 5580.280000000001
right but uh

5583.3 --> 5586.399
[Music]

5588.8 --> 5592.52
yeah just going to move

5602.76 --> 5605.76
on

5632.719 --> 5636.76
e for

5683.6 --> 5688.119000000001
now that the dust is

5685.52 --> 5690.719
settled

5688.119 --> 5693.839999999999
yeah I mean that did kind of wake me up

5690.719 --> 5696.84
a bit

5693.84 --> 5696.84
all

5737.32 --> 5742.0
right and I hope everybody else is doing

5745.32 --> 5751.239
fine right

5747.84 --> 5755.119000000001
all a lot of us are having a bit of a

5751.239 --> 5757.159
tough time around this period

5755.119 --> 5760.4
from multiple

5757.159 --> 5764.119
fronts environmentally

5760.4 --> 5764.119
biologically and from

5764.48 --> 5770.599999999999
society and yeah it's mostly just like

5767.88 --> 5772.56
just keep holding on don't worry

5770.6 --> 5775.280000000001
yourself too much

5772.56 --> 5778.1990000000005
don't Ponder upon things you can't

5775.28 --> 5780.759999999999
really change anything

5778.199 --> 5782.879999999999
about that would be my

5780.76 --> 5785.56
recommendation just try to focus on

5782.88 --> 5785.56
things that are

5786.48 --> 5790.159
productive the best for you is the best

5788.719 --> 5794.28
way to get through

5790.159 --> 5794.28
it and I'm doing that

5798.239 --> 5805.36
myself all right but sometimes

5801.84 --> 5807.8
yeah and I mostly try to avoid that I

5805.36 --> 5810.08
mean I have been when is the last time I

5807.8 --> 5812.320000000001
really like yelled like that on my

5810.08 --> 5816.639
show that's a while

5812.32 --> 5816.639
ago but they don't really do that

5817.96 --> 5826.04
anymore why because I've really actively

5822.679 --> 5828.679
try to avoid it

5826.04 --> 5833.04
cuz getting angry like that is not

5828.679 --> 5836.04
healthy and it does just draw in more

5833.04 --> 5836.04
disgusting

5836.32 --> 5841.88
people which then feel motivated to get

5839.159 --> 5845.48
in my face and be all

5841.88 --> 5847.2390000000005
patronizing and I don't want them I I

5845.48 --> 5849.599999999999
don't I don't want to have anything to

5847.239 --> 5849.599999999999
do with

5855.199 --> 5862.32
them right and in that sense even just

5860.04 --> 5865.239
letting teret

5862.32 --> 5866.679
speak for a few minutes was a mistake

5865.239 --> 5869.919999999999
it's that

5866.679 --> 5873.639
bad but he just seemed kind of

5869.92 --> 5877.119
neutral like not being overtly offensive

5873.639 --> 5879.400000000001
so I was like hey hey ging wisdom good

5877.119 --> 5882.96
to see you welcome

5879.4 --> 5882.96
back I can see

5889.28 --> 5897.4
you so yeah I just thought like maybe

5894.32 --> 5900.5199999999995
maybe I could kind of like work things

5897.4 --> 5902.119
out shortly but then he just kept he

5900.52 --> 5905.0
basically

5902.119 --> 5908.4
kept it

5905.0 --> 5911.48
ignoring ignoring me and just piling on

5908.4 --> 5915.119
endless amounts of whiny

5911.48 --> 5917.678999999999
criticism and judgment and like

5915.119 --> 5920.5599999999995
yeah to the point where he just became

5917.679 --> 5923.56
very personal with his insults and like

5920.56 --> 5925.96
yeah that's exactly what I didn't

5923.56 --> 5927.84
want the guy is just you can't

5925.96 --> 5932.0
communicate with

5927.84 --> 5935.4400000000005
it he is mentally deranged

5932.0 --> 5938.48
provably and cyberstalker and he's been

5935.44 --> 5942.08
doing it for a long

5938.48 --> 5944.159
time on like a daily basis and there's

5942.08 --> 5946.28
just nothing I I don't know how to deal

5944.159 --> 5946.28
with

5946.52 --> 5952.4400000000005
it other than just like just kick him

5949.52 --> 5955.1990000000005
out every time permanently that's all I

5952.44 --> 5955.199
can really do with

5960.239 --> 5966.199
it ter when he says he has a Troll Army

5963.96 --> 5968.08
no not really but I mean he's connected

5966.199 --> 5970.678999999999
with all the other disgusting troll

5968.08 --> 5974.28
figures out there all the anti flat

5970.679 --> 5974.28
earther troller

5975.119 --> 5979.92
trolls I'm not even going to name them

5977.28 --> 5983.599
all but I

5979.92 --> 5987.84
mean those are his Troll Army

5983.599 --> 5987.84
supposedly that's it

5996.04 --> 6000.48
you doing b d

6020.39 --> 6023.439
[Music]

6024.0 --> 6027.079
[Applause]

6047.4 --> 6050.32
do I know who they

6050.52 --> 6055.2390000000005
are I know their internet

6055.52 --> 6060.119000000001
handles most of

6057.719 --> 6063.56
them but I kind of forget about their

6060.119 --> 6067.32
names anyway like I even

6063.56 --> 6067.320000000001
just mentioning

6068.4 --> 6073.719
them is like giving them too much credit

6075.32 --> 6079.28
really it's your first

6081.52 --> 6088.76
suck all right oh glad to have you here

6084.44 --> 6088.759999999999
getting wisdom good see you

6143.159 --> 6146.159
for

6209.08 --> 6216.599
H well good for you Gary I hope it stays

6212.159 --> 6216.598999999999
like that I mean they're very

6232.04 --> 6235.04
annoying

6262.04 --> 6266.08
for for

6298.84 --> 6304.360000000001
right anyhow uh yeah I've been going for

6301.639 --> 6307.88
hour 43 minutes

6304.36 --> 6310.96
let's hopefully move on to a bit of a

6307.88 --> 6313.400000000001
better conversation

6310.96 --> 6317.0
and

6313.4 --> 6317.0
this is not

6318.239 --> 6324.36
nice did all of you check my show from

6321.8 --> 6327.679
yesterday yes yesterday night the night

6324.36 --> 6332.799999999999
owl show number seven it went

6327.679 --> 6332.8
great it's a great show very happy about

6335.159 --> 6342.28
that how it went very nice and fluid

6339.04 --> 6345.08
fullon Technical and I like that like

6342.28 --> 6347.88
the opportunity to get all

6345.08 --> 6352.119
technical I guess in the evening people

6347.88 --> 6352.119
are more up for that

6381.92 --> 6385.88
all for

6440.96 --> 6446.76
chill out stream yeah yeah that was

6459.639 --> 6464.400000000001
great flat was live streaming it for a

6462.88 --> 6466.92
bit

6464.4 --> 6469.119
what oh when he came in there or

6466.92 --> 6471.679
something and acted like a complete

6469.119 --> 6474.159
troll [ __ ] and then I banned

6471.679 --> 6476.599
him yeah I bet he

6474.159 --> 6479.879999999999
did I mean what the hell's wrong with

6476.599 --> 6479.88
you flat soid

6492.159 --> 6499.4
seriously it's just ridiculous that you

6494.96 --> 6499.4
do that it really is

6521.199 --> 6525.28
right but it was nice to get all

6522.48 --> 6528.759999999999
Technical and everything

6525.28 --> 6530.92
and I don't know maybe at some point I

6528.76 --> 6534.159000000001
will like kind of like just stop the

6530.92 --> 6537.639
early bird show maybe because I will

6534.159 --> 6541.0
have some work to do or whatever I mean

6537.639 --> 6545.0
if I'm going to make money with

6541.0 --> 6545.0
it in an effective

6545.08 --> 6552.04
way then I can potentially like grow out

6548.8 --> 6552.04
of my situation

6552.28 --> 6559.36
here and that would certainly yield me

6555.599 --> 6561.28
to have more energy and when I then do a

6559.36 --> 6564.4
show which would then probably be a

6561.28 --> 6566.759999999999
night owl show or something

6564.4 --> 6570.48
periodically I think it would

6566.76 --> 6573.679
potentially go great just like like like

6570.48 --> 6575.119
we did yesterday would probably be like

6573.679 --> 6578.2390000000005
that every

6575.119 --> 6581.96
time I mean if my situation is improving

6578.239 --> 6581.959999999999
I yeah I don't see why it

6583.119 --> 6590.719
wouldn't but I mean it is pretty much

6586.0 --> 6593.56
conditional on that right I've been

6590.719 --> 6596.28
relatively hesitant to like oh just just

6593.56 --> 6598.2390000000005
get a job well is that actually going to

6596.28 --> 6601.119
financially improve my

6598.239 --> 6602.159
situation that's the real question will

6601.119 --> 6606.598999999999
it do

6602.159 --> 6608.0
that I mean if it would then yeah maybe

6606.599 --> 6610.8
it would be worth

6608.0 --> 6613.88
it if it doesn't then there's just no

6610.8 --> 6616.0
point in just me suddenly being occupied

6613.88 --> 6618.679
with having to do all these things and

6616.0 --> 6621.48
and me not improving because of

6618.679 --> 6626.2390000000005
that and not doing the early bir show

6621.48 --> 6630.48
anymore because I mean through you your

6626.239 --> 6630.48
support that helps me get

6634.28 --> 6639.0
by it's been very helpful talking about

6637.32 --> 6641.199
which please do support me through the

6639.0 --> 6646.28
PayPal and the patreon that would be

6641.199 --> 6646.28
great I can always use the support

6665.96 --> 6672.8
can't handle other people opinion I

6668.599 --> 6675.679
don't know Gary I mean I don't want any

6672.8 --> 6678.4800000000005
hostilities with flatso I just he

6675.679 --> 6682.04
just trolls me

6678.48 --> 6685.119
now I don't know why other than that

6682.04 --> 6688.239
he's just the troll baiter he

6685.119 --> 6692.0
just let trolls hang around too much and

6688.239 --> 6692.0
it's like infected

6694.0 --> 6700.28
him flat soid Hoards trolls now and

6697.719 --> 6702.4
plays their videos and all that

6700.28 --> 6706.599
ridiculing

6702.4 --> 6708.4
everybody so that's what he does now I

6706.599 --> 6711.679
don't want to associate with people that

6708.4 --> 6711.679
do that

6712.84 --> 6721.04
and the more that keeps happening

6716.36 --> 6723.199
the the less I will care for flat I mean

6721.04 --> 6725.88
I still sort of see him like a flat

6723.199 --> 6729.4
earther but I mean you can't

6725.88 --> 6732.32
really he's not really worth

6729.4 --> 6734.0
much compared to like a few years ago

6732.32 --> 6736.119
where he was just an interesting

6734.0 --> 6738.04
platform that delves into Flat Earth

6736.119 --> 6740.92
typically and then it's like oh yeah

6738.04 --> 6744.5199999999995
cool you can hang around that but now

6740.92 --> 6744.52
it's mostly troll [ __ ]

6745.88 --> 6750.56
like I don't want to have anything to do

6748.36 --> 6750.5599999999995
with

6751.52 --> 6756.76
that and I know that my shows aren't

6754.44 --> 6760.48
exactly like the

6756.76 --> 6765.079000000001
most tip of the toe riveting type

6760.48 --> 6768.36
streams out there I know I'm

6765.079 --> 6770.639
sorry you heard yeah yeah and I

6768.36 --> 6773.28
apologized for that party fish Hey

6770.639 --> 6776.400000000001
Nobody's perfect I literally apologized

6773.28 --> 6778.8
for that he accepted my

6776.4 --> 6784.119
apology there's nothing I can do after

6778.8 --> 6787.1990000000005
that point party fish yeah so why always

6784.119 --> 6787.199
keep bringing that

6787.32 --> 6790.32
up

6792.76 --> 6797.52
why yeah I mean what you're going to

6795.48 --> 6800.0
like roll out the list of everything

6797.52 --> 6803.360000000001
I've ever done wrong in my life going to

6800.0 --> 6805.88
keep doing that every freaking time

6803.36 --> 6809.88
does anything I've ever done wrong in my

6805.88 --> 6812.2390000000005
life justify why other people act the

6809.88 --> 6812.2390000000005
way they

6815.56 --> 6823.76
do really did you know that clutch was

6820.079 --> 6827.04
once kind of mean to me at some point do

6823.76 --> 6829.96
I continually every time he doesn't just

6827.04 --> 6834.159
do exactly what I want him to do do I

6829.96 --> 6837.0
every time remind him that maybe

6834.159 --> 6838.32
maybe still guilty for doing that thing

6837.0 --> 6841.119
back then

6838.32 --> 6843.36
no no I don't because it's totally

6841.119 --> 6845.96
pointless it's totally pointless to

6843.36 --> 6848.48
continually remind somebody of what they

6845.96 --> 6851.199
did wrong in the past I don't do it

6848.48 --> 6854.44
wrong now and I

6851.199 --> 6856.678999999999
apologize oh it's the only reason why do

6854.44 --> 6859.839999999999
you think there is a

6856.679 --> 6862.88
reason for a flat side to act like he

6859.84 --> 6865.92
does really so I said something about

6862.88 --> 6868.96
his kids and that's why he now

6865.92 --> 6871.92
continually has trolls hanging around on

6868.96 --> 6875.199
his channel reviewing Troll videos

6871.92 --> 6878.1990000000005
mocking me and other flat

6875.199 --> 6881.36
earthers really that's because I said

6878.199 --> 6881.36
something about his

6882.04 --> 6887.56
kid does that sound like sound reasoning

6885.36 --> 6887.5599999999995
to

6888.88 --> 6895.079
you you didn't hey why didn't you stop

6891.76 --> 6898.0
making excusing and bolting away from

6895.079 --> 6901.4
what I'm addressing right here

6898.0 --> 6905.36
yeah you're saying I this is the reason

6901.4 --> 6905.36
why I can think he's acting like that oh

6906.239 --> 6912.199
really when I have publicly apologize to

6915.199 --> 6922.5199999999995
him maybe the reason why he's acting

6918.119 --> 6924.88
like this is because he's a troll now

6922.52 --> 6928.96
have you ever considered party fish that

6924.88 --> 6932.4800000000005
maybe Flats soid is just a troll now

6928.96 --> 6935.36
yeah when you hang around with

6932.48 --> 6938.239
trolls you play Troll

6935.36 --> 6943.48
videos and you act like a

6938.239 --> 6947.959999999999
troll guess what you're a

6943.48 --> 6950.959999999999
troll yeah maybe that is the issue and

6947.96 --> 6955.079
not that I said something about his kid

6950.96 --> 6959.679
a year ago and apologized for it yeah

6955.079 --> 6961.92
maybe his current state has something to

6959.679 --> 6964.119
do with it and not the thing that

6961.92 --> 6966.92
happened a year ago have you ever

6964.119 --> 6966.92
considered

6972.079 --> 6977.759999999999
that you brought it up yeah well I'm

6974.88 --> 6977.76
telling you

6981.239 --> 6985.28
now for

7002.6 --> 7005.679
[Music]

7011.36 --> 7014.86
[Music]

7024.239 --> 7030.119
no that's not the response that's not a

7027.4 --> 7032.719
proper response why don't you just

7030.119 --> 7034.239
acknowledge what I just

7032.719 --> 7038.32
said

7034.239 --> 7042.638999999999
acknowledge what I said party

7038.32 --> 7048.799999999999
fish not dropping it not rolling on to

7042.639 --> 7048.8
some other thing acknowledge what I said

7095.28 --> 7098.28
good

7105.639 --> 7111.88
and hearing saying that you heard me is

7108.639 --> 7115.639
not acknowledging what I

7111.88 --> 7115.639
said it's giving

7115.84 --> 7121.159000000001
recognition to the argument that I

7121.239 --> 7126.44
brought like yes Arwin you have a

7127.44 --> 7133.4
point yeah what happened a year ago for

7131.199 --> 7135.759999999999
which I did a

7133.4 --> 7139.719
apologize

7135.76 --> 7142.4400000000005
unconditionally is not a reason for flat

7139.719 --> 7145.639
soy to be the way he is and do his show

7142.44 --> 7149.759999999999
the way he does right now

7145.639 --> 7149.76
yeah you can't connect that

7150.48 --> 7155.5199999999995
up and by the way back then he was

7153.4 --> 7158.638999999999
already kind of doing that he was

7155.52 --> 7161.400000000001
already like being overly tolerant to

7158.639 --> 7164.639
trolls and like playing their videos and

7161.4 --> 7166.96
giving them es like that was an issue a

7164.639 --> 7169.96
year ago

7166.96 --> 7169.96
already

7170.44 --> 7179.04
yeah so the problem for his behavior

7174.239 --> 7184.799999999999
right now and being a troll precedes my

7179.04 --> 7184.8
offense that I apologized for okay

7199.4 --> 7202.5199999999995
I mean I hope that's

7215.639 --> 7220.56
clear by the way debat I don't know what

7217.96 --> 7222.4800000000005
the hell you're talking about Sovereign

7220.56 --> 7225.92
Soul feature

7222.48 --> 7225.919999999999
like what

7257.81 --> 7261.079000000001
[Applause]

7289.88 --> 7292.88
for

7314.48 --> 7319.759999999999
yeah keep saying that dude keep

7317.36 --> 7323.0
repeating yourself party

7319.76 --> 7325.8
fish yeah I think too I think his kid

7323.0 --> 7329.639
should be protected too

7325.8 --> 7334.599
yeah can we move on

7329.639 --> 7334.599
now can can we address anything

7335.079 --> 7342.84
else could you just bring up anything

7339.159 --> 7345.44
else please and not all always [ __ ]

7342.84 --> 7345.4400000000005
bring that

7356.96 --> 7361.84
up Sovereign so unchain mind he was in

7360.36 --> 7365.5199999999995
oh

7361.84 --> 7368.1990000000005
right yeah well you seemed to be just

7365.52 --> 7370.400000000001
fine in my chat debatable D I mean just

7368.199 --> 7373.0
because somebody hangs around flat so it

7370.4 --> 7374.719
doesn't automatically mean that that

7373.0 --> 7376.48
they can't hang around me if they're

7374.719 --> 7380.0
just behaving

7376.48 --> 7380.0
fine then that's

7380.239 --> 7387.32
fine right as long as they're not like

7383.52 --> 7390.84
like really just nastily behaving in

7387.32 --> 7394.48
other people's chats [ __ ] all over

7390.84 --> 7394.4800000000005
me behind my

7396.0 --> 7403.56
back I said move on age go yeah yet

7400.119 --> 7403.5599999999995

7406.56 --> 7415.4800000000005
you you three minutes ago brought it up

7410.76 --> 7419.4800000000005
again yeah you brought it up again

7415.48 --> 7422.28
though so you stop bringing it up yeah

7419.48 --> 7425.119
you can't just say move on ages ago when

7422.28 --> 7428.28
3 minutes ago you literally brought it

7425.119 --> 7431.239
up again in the chat party fish that's

7428.28 --> 7432.28
not moving on that's you bringing it up

7431.239 --> 7435.0
3 minutes

7432.28 --> 7440.119
ago don't bring it up again if you want

7435.0 --> 7445.6
to move on move on you move on by not

7440.119 --> 7448.679
bringing it up again you got it

7445.6 --> 7448.679
[Music]

7463.36 --> 7469.28
I don't care party fish I don't [ __ ]

7469.92 --> 7474.599
care if if this is all you're going to

7472.599 --> 7478.159000000001
say I will just kick you out I don't

7474.599 --> 7481.4800000000005
want to do this I don't want some sock

7478.159 --> 7483.598999999999
account that's continually just going to

7481.48 --> 7485.839999999999
have pointless

7483.599 --> 7491.2390000000005
whining you've done nothing but

7485.84 --> 7491.2390000000005
pointlessly whine stop it

7522.119 --> 7527.0
but they were say no I'm not going to

7524.0 --> 7530.36
debatable I'm not going to watch flat

7527.0 --> 7533.0
soid stream to see how they were calling

7530.36 --> 7535.159
me disgusting things because they're

7533.0 --> 7538.199
just sick [ __ ] trolls I'm not going

7535.159 --> 7538.199
to do it debatable

7545.559 --> 7552.559
d right so that's all fine you want to

7548.88 --> 7558.36
be just a sick backstabbing scumbag that

7552.559 --> 7561.96
just gossips like a little whiny teenag

7558.36 --> 7564.598999999999
[ __ ] go ahead go hang around absolute

7561.96 --> 7566.28
scum and do that and talk [ __ ] about me

7564.599 --> 7569.84
all you want but if you do it in my chat

7566.28 --> 7569.84
I kick you out

7583.8 --> 7589.88
right and I mean people will take note

7586.599 --> 7592.679
of what you do and if you if you are

7589.88 --> 7596.04
caught talking [ __ ] behind my

7592.679 --> 7599.04
back about me being really

7596.04 --> 7600.88
disgusting that will downgrade my

7599.04 --> 7603.76
opinion of you and the way I'm going to

7600.88 --> 7603.76
treat you in my

7608.36 --> 7614.32
chat but usually people that do that

7611.199 --> 7617.0
they don't really even connect up that

7614.32 --> 7619.679
much they won't be more than just people

7617.0 --> 7621.8
that just happen to hang around anyway

7619.679 --> 7625.4800000000005
right you don't I don't bond with people

7621.8 --> 7625.4800000000005
that do that it can't

7625.84 --> 7631.679
work it's not even a matter of having

7629.36 --> 7634.199
attention or Consciousness about those

7631.679 --> 7636.88
actions it's just when people do that

7634.199 --> 7636.879999999999
you just don't

7636.96 --> 7642.28
bond it doesn't happen

7639.76 --> 7646.639
then so you just kind of to stay a

7642.28 --> 7646.639
backdrop character and that's

7650.119 --> 7658.28
it take my word for it about him sure de

7654.599 --> 7658.28
whatever sure that's all

7670.44 --> 7673.44
fine

7700.44 --> 7704.48
for e

7733.599 --> 7740.0
right I need a two-minute break we be

7735.599 --> 7740.0
right back take it easy everyone

7790.32 --> 7793.32
you

7820.32 --> 7824.28
for for

7895.76 --> 7902.079000000001
back

7898.079 --> 7902.079
nothing okay

7916.4 --> 7921.799999999999
fire on the bottom of the globe upside

7919.079 --> 7926.679
down how does that

7921.8 --> 7926.679
work well supposed gravity right

7927.76 --> 7934.360000000001
richy presupposition of

7930.88 --> 7938.559
gravity based on Newtonian

7934.36 --> 7941.759999999999
mechanics even though that doesn't work

7938.559 --> 7944.88
I mean water Finds Its level and

7941.76 --> 7944.88
all level is

7947.88 --> 7957.2390000000005
parallel and because level is

7951.96 --> 7957.2390000000005
parallel yeah there's no gravity

7958.88 --> 7966.4800000000005
that's moving things towards the center

7962.28 --> 7966.48
point it's just not happening

7976.719 --> 7982.76
there is no

7978.599 --> 7982.76
bottom we don't know that Gary

7992.079 --> 8001.799999999999
F gravity is

7995.679 --> 8003.76
weight uh now weight is weight

8001.8 --> 8006.04
but

8003.76 --> 8009.639
weight there is

8006.04 --> 8012.5199999999995
a structured way of reasoning that

8009.639 --> 8016.92
suggests that weight is caused by

8012.52 --> 8016.92
gravity can be calculated like

8017.239 --> 8024.04
that but weight is basically a derived

8020.96 --> 8024.04
concept A

8025.559 --> 8034.079000000001
convention you weigh one G

8030.04 --> 8034.079
what for

8055.41 --> 8059.139999999999
[Music]

8081.119 --> 8086.239
weightless objects are yeah but that's a

8084.159 --> 8088.239
presupposition though clear I mean what

8086.239 --> 8092.079
do you mean weightless objects there is

8088.239 --> 8092.079
no weightless object

8100.719 --> 8105.639
oh

8101.639 --> 8105.639
unaffected right

8123.0 --> 8127.689
oh

8124.58 --> 8127.689
[Applause]

8132.86 --> 8136.0
[Applause]

8180.38 --> 8183.619
[Music]

8185.32 --> 8189.558999999999
oh scan that's disgusting

8218.88 --> 8221.88
for

8247.96 --> 8251.839999999998
what I don't what are you talking about

8250.28 --> 8255.16
Gary if you have no idea what you're

8251.84 --> 8255.16
talking about

8283.559 --> 8287.009
[Applause]

8292.799 --> 8295.949
[Music]

8314.07 --> 8317.19

[Applause]

8568.12 --> 8572.439
laughs at it at what

8573.24 --> 8576.399
yeah I don't know who you're talking

8574.399 --> 8580.92
about Gary

8576.399 --> 8580.92
Fe something lightning I don't

8586.8 --> 8591.279999999999
know chat is quiet yeah a

8592.479 --> 8597.64
little that's okay I

8594.8 --> 8601.679999999998
mean well it's not okay it would be nice

8597.64 --> 8601.68
if you guys would uh

8602.359 --> 8608.279
have some more interaction and maybe I

8604.76 --> 8610.64
can address something as well in that

8608.279 --> 8614.52
yeah what was it called again pick up an

8610.64 --> 8618.72
object give it energy

8614.52 --> 8620.92
uh well that yeah you give it energy

8618.72 --> 8624.76
that's how it's described but I mean

8620.92 --> 8624.76
that that's in like force

8627.84 --> 8634.6
mechanics it's a way to reason things

8631.56 --> 8638.96
out not necessarily A system that I

8634.6 --> 8638.960000000001
really you find useful or

8642.72 --> 8648.76
anything there's a word for I don't

8645.08 --> 8648.76
remember I don't remember what that's

8654.04 --> 8660.160000000002
called Dell says it's

8657.64 --> 8664.96
BS yeah well Dell's probably a little

8660.16 --> 8664.96
bit right I never really respected that

8665.8 --> 8671.519999999999
reasoning it kind of predates relative

8668.52 --> 8671.52
density

8700.64 --> 8705.8
flat argued is against Dell that's

8706.399 --> 8710.88
silly but I mean Dell doesn't really

8709.16 --> 8712.92
have a point either with his point of

8710.88 --> 8716.199999999999
view he's just presupposing that the

8712.92 --> 8716.2
Earth is moving upward

8717.439 --> 8724.279
and it's not explaining anything either

8721.399 --> 8724.278999999999
it's just another

8724.319 --> 8731.56
presupposition me if you just hold tight

8728.12 --> 8736.319000000001
to relative density mechanics

8731.56 --> 8736.319
then that that actually works

8736.92 --> 8743.72
out despite Dell saying that it doesn't

8740.319 --> 8743.72
yeah it does

8773.479 --> 8778.92
oh that's it potential energy that's

8776.0 --> 8782.24
right yeah the

8778.92 --> 8782.24
potential good one

8790.88 --> 8798.399
clear he's only trying to solve

8794.399 --> 8798.399
a I didn't know g

8800.12 --> 8805.439
f i don't think he's really solving a

8803.0 --> 8810.6
problem he's just like really hang on

8805.439 --> 8810.6
hanging on to that one idea

8812.6 --> 8816.960000000001
it's kind of

8814.72 --> 8819.08
silly I mean he's not going to be able

8816.96 --> 8824.08
to prove the Earth is moving upward it

8819.08 --> 8826.279
just won't can't very manipulate it can

8824.08 --> 8829.12
only presuppose

8826.279 --> 8832.04
it it's

8829.12 --> 8835.0
just theory of special

8832.04 --> 8837.76
relativity but on a flat plane and

8835.0 --> 8837.76
that's all he's

8839.16 --> 8843.16
doing for

8878.16 --> 8881.16
for

8888.86 --> 8891.979000000001
[Music]

8894.45 --> 8897.519
[Music]

8904.88 --> 8909.88
potential low Ms what

8959.88 --> 8964.8
all right but I mean the reasoning I

8962.0 --> 8967.319
remember the reasoning behind potential

8964.8 --> 8972.199999999999
energy

8967.319 --> 8975.56
it's basically a way to point out

8972.2 --> 8977.76
how like even bypassing relative density

8975.56 --> 8981.199999999999
and then bypassing how there isn't a

8977.76 --> 8984.0
constant force being subjected to

8981.2 --> 8987.16
whatever is happening that's the idea

8984.0 --> 8990.359
behind it it's like oh something is

8987.16 --> 8992.399
falling because of gravity pulling it or

8990.359 --> 8996.04
because of the Earth rising

8992.399 --> 8999.039999999999
upward but then the argument is like

8996.04 --> 9003.359
no something is falling because it's

8999.04 --> 9006.04
been lifted off its resting

9003.359 --> 9007.800000000001
position and so the energy has been

9006.04 --> 9012.960000000001
introduced

9007.8 --> 9016.479
potentially that when then let go it

9012.96 --> 9019.759999999998
will try to go back to its original

9016.479 --> 9021.72
position that's the idea behind it so

9019.76 --> 9025.279
it's a piece of reasoning that's like

9021.72 --> 9028.438999999998
kind of primitive but serves

9025.279 --> 9030.68
to bypass the notion of any

9028.439 --> 9032.12
presuppositions about a force that's

9030.68 --> 9034.279
happening

9032.12 --> 9037.640000000001
somehow of

9034.279 --> 9040.640000000001
gravity or upward Rising

9037.64 --> 9044.519999999999
earth right but I mean technically

9040.64 --> 9049.199999999999
relative density Theory works way better

9044.52 --> 9049.2
and it it's scientifically valid

9053.319 --> 9059.039999999999
so

9054.6 --> 9061.960000000001
I I prefer relative density was used

9059.04 --> 9064.960000000001
within a rottal or an argument rather

9061.96 --> 9066.96
than potential energy because potential

9064.96 --> 9071.16
energy is just kind of conceptual and

9066.96 --> 9071.16
not really all that useful

9085.359 --> 9091.56
Things fall at 9.8 m per

9089.2 --> 9094.640000000001
second yeah but they don't really

9091.56 --> 9098.519999999999
exactly you know it's

9094.64 --> 9098.519999999999
not it's just an

9105.08 --> 9109.319
average I know Angel Rose it's not

9107.68 --> 9111.84
really about something moving back to

9109.319 --> 9111.84
original

9112.0 --> 9117.76
position it's just an argument to

9115.279 --> 9121.279
redirect where the force is coming from

9117.76 --> 9121.279
that that is all

9147.319 --> 9150.319
okay

9170.72 --> 9176.92
all right I'm thinking about a

9173.319 --> 9180.119999999999
title 2 hours 30 minutes in I'm just

9176.92 --> 9180.12
what am I going to call this

9184.64 --> 9189.72
thing why you think

9187.319 --> 9193.16
density

9189.72 --> 9193.16
uh cuz it

9193.319 --> 9198.24
is provably scientifically

9204.16 --> 9211.52
9.8 m/ second is just an average

9208.16 --> 9213.92
yeah I mean

9211.52 --> 9216.92
if like there's air

9213.92 --> 9216.92
friction

9217.08 --> 9226.0
right and if it's low enough then the

9222.12 --> 9226.0
acceleration yeah

9227.2 --> 9233.76
like the idea is 9.8 eight in a vacuum

9232.12 --> 9237.960000000001
is the fall

9233.76 --> 9240.52
rate and I think that probably holds up

9237.96 --> 9243.199999999999
but it basically just indicates like how

9240.52 --> 9245.52
much force is behind the density thise

9243.2 --> 9248.84
equilibrium the maximized density thise

9245.52 --> 9251.0
equilibrium possible and

9248.84 --> 9254.0
then the

9251.0 --> 9258.399
force that that this equilibrium

9254.0 --> 9258.399
subjects to the object

9261.2 --> 9267.52
right like with a helium balloon it

9264.68 --> 9270.319
would work the same the other direction

9267.52 --> 9273.560000000001
except for that helium balloon will be

9270.319 --> 9274.92
much more subjected by friction CU if

9273.56 --> 9278.8
you put it in a

9274.92 --> 9282.16
vacuum it's it will still want to go

9278.8 --> 9286.039999999999
downward not upward because well

9282.16 --> 9286.039999999999
everything is more dense than a

9288.16 --> 9294.039999999999
vacuum the word relative is

9291.279 --> 9298.04
Superfluous superf

9294.04 --> 9298.04
flowers Superfluous you

9298.12 --> 9302.08
mean not super

9303.08 --> 9310.12
flus but I know what you mean no but

9306.52 --> 9311.68
it's not relative density is the theory

9310.12 --> 9314.439
you could say

9311.68 --> 9317.319
density but relative density is just a

9314.439 --> 9320.6
little bit more

9317.319 --> 9324.0
specific right because the word density

9320.6 --> 9326.52
is also associated with density buoyancy

9324.0 --> 9328.92
which still has a gravity presupposition

9326.52 --> 9332.16
tied in with

9328.92 --> 9335.359
it so if like within the field of

9332.16 --> 9339.399
physics you just say density people tend

9335.359 --> 9342.479000000001
to then draw gravity in with

9339.399 --> 9345.399
it presupposition of gravity they still

9342.479 --> 9349.199999999999
do that you say relative density it's

9345.399 --> 9353.0
like more specifically pointing at the

9349.2 --> 9355.52
develop vment of the density Theory into

9353.0 --> 9358.359
relative density within the Flat Earth

9355.52 --> 9358.359
Community as a

9364.68 --> 9371.2
reference besides relative density is a

9367.72 --> 9373.8
way better way to describe

9371.2 --> 9376.0
it because it's all about the relation

9373.8 --> 9379.679999999998
of the

9376.0 --> 9381.52
density the density of the object and

9379.68 --> 9384.92
the density of the medium that object is

9381.52 --> 9384.92
in it's about that

9386.08 --> 9390.319
relationship that's what the theory is

9388.08 --> 9390.319
all

9390.64 --> 9395.56
about right just density doesn't do

9394.08 --> 9397.319
anything it's the relation of the

9395.56 --> 9400.08
density of the object with the density

9397.319 --> 9403.039999999999
of the medium that

9400.08 --> 9404.039999999999
determines through the disequilibrium

9403.04 --> 9406.960000000001
between

9404.04 --> 9411.479000000001
those how much force is subjected to the

9406.96 --> 9411.479
object and in what direction

9412.12 --> 9417.960000000001
all density is

9414.96 --> 9417.96
relative

9431.56 --> 9437.24
arguably he time night three could see

9434.24 --> 9437.24
you

9455.72 --> 9459.64
my relatives are dense yeah very funny

9459.72 --> 9465.84
clear all this instead of rapy doesn't

9462.92 --> 9468.12
make sense uh yeah it does besides you

9465.84 --> 9471.24
can't even properly define gravity

9468.12 --> 9473.76
within physics inad

9471.24 --> 9477.039999999999
anything other than pseudo scientific

9473.76 --> 9477.04
that's a fact Angel

9477.64 --> 9484.599999999999
Rose yeah Newtonian mechanics are not

9481.76 --> 9488.439
scientific Einstein gravity doesn't

9484.6 --> 9490.84
explain anything

9488.439 --> 9493.76
about the

9490.84 --> 9496.359
forces that objects are subjected to or

9493.76 --> 9500.439
anything

9496.359 --> 9504.52
so it is relative density

9500.439 --> 9506.84
is what people associate with

9504.52 --> 9509.439
gravity the things happening in this

9506.84 --> 9512.72
world the passive vertical displacement

9509.439 --> 9512.720000000001
yeah that's because of relative

9524.52 --> 9534.24
density why is less dense air higher up

9531.08 --> 9538.24
well that hasn't nothing to do with the

9534.24 --> 9540.68
density of the air necessarily other

9538.24 --> 9545.0
than

9540.68 --> 9548.720000000001
well helium and hydrogen are less

9545.0 --> 9553.439
dense than say carbon dioxide and

9548.72 --> 9556.92
oxygen and so they will have a tendency

9553.439 --> 9560.52
to go upward because they're less

9556.92 --> 9562.84
dense but I mean they're a it's air so

9560.52 --> 9565.439
it does move in all directions pretty

9562.84 --> 9568.12
much that's why it's an inhomogeneous

9565.439 --> 9571.439
mesh and not like layers of different

9568.12 --> 9574.6
types of gases that are keep

9571.439 --> 9576.800000000001
separate right but there's a gradient

9574.6 --> 9580.640000000001
happening not because of relative

9576.8 --> 9583.92
density that's not the cause of the

9580.64 --> 9587.519999999999
gradient there's another influence that

9583.92 --> 9591.04
is inevitably causing that

9587.52 --> 9592.76
and the suspicion for it that you can

9591.04 --> 9594.880000000001
argue is that it's because of

9592.76 --> 9597.76
temperature

9594.88 --> 9601.599999999999
influences if you subject a

9597.76 --> 9604.479
container to a cold and a heat element

9601.6 --> 9607.880000000001
in opposite sides of the container then

9604.479 --> 9610.72
the gas within that closed system is

9607.88 --> 9613.24
going to gradiate where there's going to

9610.72 --> 9618.08
be more

9613.24 --> 9622.16
pressure of air closer to the heat part

9618.08 --> 9625.52
the heated part and less pressure in the

9622.16 --> 9627.439
cooled part that's like how the density

9625.52 --> 9630.52
of the

9627.439 --> 9635.479000000001
gases how the pressure will arrange

9630.52 --> 9637.560000000001
itself within that micro dnamic

9635.479 --> 9641.599999999999
system

9637.56 --> 9644.119999999999
so yeah density doesn't have a direct

9641.6 --> 9648.68
causal relationship with why there is a

9644.12 --> 9648.68
gas pressure gradient within the realm

9652.359 --> 9657.439
that's most likely because of a

9654.88 --> 9657.438999999998
temperature

9657.52 --> 9663.640000000001
influence cold at the top Heat at ground

9660.64 --> 9663.64
level

9680.84 --> 9688.16
more dense air is

9683.6 --> 9688.16
higher what you mean

9688.439 --> 9697.359
c yeah water vapor as a gas is pretty

9693.0 --> 9698.84
dense so it has a tendency to not go up

9697.359 --> 9702.16
as

9698.84 --> 9704.319
high and when it does and it cools off

9702.16 --> 9707.68
it kind of condensates and you get like

9704.319 --> 9712.319
this in between state that we see as

9707.68 --> 9714.68
clouds cuz those are not gases they're

9712.319 --> 9716.519999999999
droplets they're basically in liquid

9714.68 --> 9719.04
state

9716.52 --> 9721.640000000001
suspended colloidal

9719.04 --> 9723.6
suspension and that's why we see clouds

9721.64 --> 9725.519999999999
that's water vapor that's not really

9723.6 --> 9728.56
Vapor anymore it's in an in between

9725.52 --> 9731.76
State between vapor and

9728.56 --> 9733.8
droplet there's like a a balance between

9731.76 --> 9737.24
them they're like a micro

9733.8 --> 9739.96
droplet that has water vapor kind of

9737.24 --> 9741.92
surrounding it and it can

9739.96 --> 9745.479
become bigger but if it does then it

9741.92 --> 9745.479
also starts dropping

9745.92 --> 9751.52
down so it's a kind of in between

9748.84 --> 9754.16
State and that's why we have clouds it's

9751.52 --> 9758.720000000001
pretty interesting how that

9754.16 --> 9758.72
works colloidal suspension

9775.8 --> 9779.84
sometimes harder than it's on the ground

9777.84 --> 9782.64
CU you're higher above I don't know

9779.84 --> 9782.64
about that Angel

9784.2 --> 9790.560000000001
Rose I have no I mean there might be

9786.64 --> 9790.56
more direct sun

9790.88 --> 9797.199999999999
heating up there if there's

9793.6 --> 9801.16
like if it's all clear sky and all that

9797.2 --> 9804.279
but I mean you will also cool off

9801.16 --> 9806.56
quicker so as a rule of fist it is

9804.279 --> 9809.84
colder when you go up compared to at

9806.56 --> 9809.84
ground level

9833.52 --> 9836.52
h

9867.72 --> 9870.82
[Music]

9944.279 --> 9947.279
okay

9949.08 --> 9952.84
got a title update

9984.359 --> 9989.12
hope you guys are enjoying the show

9985.76 --> 9992.24
please don't forget to Rogan it

9989.12 --> 9995.279
up got a bit of a hassle earlier which

9992.24 --> 9997.359
was not super nice oh eight thumbs up

9995.279 --> 10000.08
wow that's not

9997.359 --> 10002.279
bad please also do support me through

10000.08 --> 10005.479
PayPal and the patreon I can really use

10002.279 --> 10005.479000000001
this support

10025.16 --> 10028.16
on

10040.319 --> 10049.72
what that man who's it's not a man it's

10044.84 --> 10049.72
Icarus it's a myth of ioras

10083.64 --> 10090.399
okay Gary you will have the language of

10086.92 --> 10090.399
math in common

10091.16 --> 10094.16
uh

10096.16 --> 10100.16
right perhaps

10101.64 --> 10104.479
Cur was not a

10109.68 --> 10114.52
man I don't

10111.52 --> 10114.52
know

10115.8 --> 10120.358999999999
was I'm confused

10130.279 --> 10133.800000000001
a

10131.2 --> 10136.359
youth tempted to escape from Creed with

10133.8 --> 10141.278999999999
wings of wax and

10136.359 --> 10141.279
Feathers yeah I guess he was a man

10163.52 --> 10167.0
if aliens Vis it

10184.64 --> 10192.358999999999
no there's already plenty of aliens

10187.56 --> 10196.359
visiting the coming from outside of your

10192.359 --> 10196.359
country so

10226.439 --> 10229.04
a big

10234.8 --> 10240.72
cloud Pond

10237.2 --> 10243.52
jumpers oh here you go with a

10240.72 --> 10248.0
pond how do you know it's a pond I mean

10243.52 --> 10248.0
it's a realm for sure but

10253.72 --> 10257.76
Pond assumes that we're on a

10259.08 --> 10265.399
disc that the North Pole is at the

10262.0 --> 10268.96
supposed center of the dis that's what

10265.399 --> 10268.96
it supposes

10301.6 --> 10310.16
outer

10303.399 --> 10310.16
wonders yeah I mean I don't think so

10329.4 --> 10336.08
[Music]

10331.88 --> 10340.0
I mean northern realer south southern

10336.08 --> 10342.399
reals perhaps

10340.0 --> 10345.239
but this whole idea of Pawns it doesn't

10342.399 --> 10345.239
really make a lot of

10346.92 --> 10352.399
sense like how much ice sheet is out

10350.12 --> 10352.399000000001
there

10355.68 --> 10363.439
then and how are

10359.64 --> 10366.0
these ponds with the Suns in them even

10363.439 --> 10369.6
moving around right it it just doesn't

10366.0 --> 10369.6
make a lot of sense

10389.04 --> 10393.04
Co this one

10402.2 --> 10405.279
what you talking about

10407.88 --> 10415.64
Gary are you talking about the diala

10410.64 --> 10415.64
destiny antia machine golden

10420.64 --> 10428.84
disc from that last Indiana Jones

10424.84 --> 10428.84
film what

10429.319 --> 10437.199999999999
outter Darkness prohibits exploration

10433.16 --> 10437.2
why why does it prohibit

10441.72 --> 10449.278999999999
exploration I mean wouldn't you be able

10444.56 --> 10453.359
to figure it out with like a proper

10449.279 --> 10457.359
laser really big one you just

10453.359 --> 10457.359
fire horizontally

10459.84 --> 10466.8
and yeah figure out how far away you can

10463.8 --> 10466.8
get

10488.479 --> 10493.88
I mean if it's like completely darkened

10492.04 --> 10496.6
let's just say that there is a pond

10493.88 --> 10496.599999999999
flatter Earth

10497.2 --> 10502.68
system I

10499.8 --> 10504.92
mean if it's that bad then it's like the

10502.68 --> 10505.880000000001
ice will just keep piling up and up and

10504.92 --> 10509.479
up

10505.88 --> 10514.039999999999
and there would be giant ice barriers

10509.479 --> 10514.039999999999
but they would be gigantic then

10525.03 --> 10528.249
[Music]

10541.0 --> 10548.0
okay Gary he said

10543.04 --> 10548.0
it back to the future reference

10548.52 --> 10552.720000000001
all righty

10550.52 --> 10555.76
then wow can't believe we're almost

10552.72 --> 10555.76
reaching the three hour

10561.439 --> 10566.76
mark all right I'm going to take a two

10563.479 --> 10566.76
minute break and I'll be right

10577.239 --> 10580.239
back

10607.239 --> 10610.239
e

10637.16 --> 10641.16
e e

10684.17 --> 10687.239
[Music]

10691.8 --> 10697.92
maybe they did lie about the moon oh you

10694.92 --> 10697.92
think

10698.64 --> 10701.64
d

10739.16 --> 10743.6
think of how many people would have to

10741.04 --> 10743.6
be in on

10745.8 --> 10752.84
it now if you compartmentalize it not

10749.6 --> 10752.84
that many

10772.04 --> 10779.52
33 people at least already

10775.76 --> 10779.52
then people would have to

10784.52 --> 10790.04
be yeah hey good to see you fiber outs

10787.08 --> 10790.039999999999
by the way

10800.6 --> 10805.76
right hope everybody's having a a good

10802.6 --> 10808.16
time amicable time I mean earlier in the

10805.76 --> 10812.319
Stream I had kind of an angry Outburst a

10808.16 --> 10816.2
bit it's been a while and hopefully I

10812.319 --> 10818.56
can like prevent that from happening

10816.2 --> 10821.6
again I think I can I I mean I didn't

10818.56 --> 10825.399
really like go off my plate or anything

10821.6 --> 10825.399000000001
from it but it was just

10825.68 --> 10833.0
because I was hoping to

10829.08 --> 10835.96
fix a social situation and it really

10833.0 --> 10840.72
backfired and I just

10835.96 --> 10840.72
got it was my disappointment pretty much

10844.12 --> 10849.92
speaking right but I'm pretty sure I'm

10846.88 --> 10849.92
not going to let that happen

10851.52 --> 10857.0
again the individual in question will

10854.72 --> 10859.399
just continue to be

10857.0 --> 10861.84
banned like I'm not going to give him a

10859.399 --> 10861.84
chance

10871.92 --> 10877.88
again right but this

10874.56 --> 10880.0
conversation more General Flat Earth Rel

10877.88 --> 10882.72
related subjects and mechanics and all

10880.0 --> 10885.08
that yeah that's been nice and also

10882.72 --> 10888.239
thanks to your the input of the guys in

10885.08 --> 10891.279
chat here it's been interesting it's

10888.239 --> 10894.279
good to go through these things

10891.279 --> 10896.800000000001
again hope you all enjoyed it on this

10894.279 --> 10896.800000000001
Sunday

10901.84 --> 10905.84
stream what

10928.08 --> 10932.64
no I have no idea what you're talking

10932.96 --> 10943.039999999999
about I've never

10936.399 --> 10943.039999999999
been in a banned let alone banned Camp

10958.6 --> 10961.6
so

10962.16 --> 10970.8
what what are you talking about Gary I'm

10966.2 --> 10970.800000000001
not following for

11014.439 --> 11020.800000000001
does my Medallion amplify my Technique

11017.8 --> 11020.8
No

11053.08 --> 11057.72
do I know you California nightmare are

11055.239 --> 11060.96
are you do you happen to be aumu virus

11057.72 --> 11060.96
say something

11094.12 --> 11097.12
h

11123.479 --> 11130.72
new here okay that okay

11127.56 --> 11133.8
fine you can my technique need of

11130.72 --> 11133.8
healing you see

11142.84 --> 11147.319
okay in what sense

11148.439 --> 11154.800000000001
I mean I don't know you yet I might be

11151.96 --> 11154.8
willing to help

11155.52 --> 11159.560000000001
you although yeah I

11161.56 --> 11168.08
mean since I basically rolled out that I

11165.279 --> 11171.08
can apply the technique and all that

11168.08 --> 11173.72
I've kind of like Fallen to a lower

11171.08 --> 11177.56
energy state so I'm having a lot of

11173.72 --> 11177.56
problems personally

11185.439 --> 11191.64
and like it still does

11188.84 --> 11195.359
work it's just

11191.64 --> 11197.16
that it doesn't work as gloriously as it

11195.359 --> 11199.16
did when it was like

11197.16 --> 11203.119999999999
really more

11199.16 --> 11208.64
whole let's say a month

11203.12 --> 11208.640000000001
ago like then it worked really well

11213.439 --> 11216.92
but I mean I might be able to help

11231.8 --> 11237.119999999999
you but yeah I mean if you're really

11234.76 --> 11239.04
serious about it then contact me on

11237.12 --> 11241.640000000001
Skype if you

11239.04 --> 11245.0
can and then we could have a one-on-one

11241.64 --> 11248.08
conversation you could explain probably

11245.0 --> 11250.56
one yeah in private a bit more about the

11248.08 --> 11250.56
overall

11250.68 --> 11255.92
situation that you're in that you

11253.239 --> 11259.68
require healing for and then I I could

11255.92 --> 11259.68
maybe try it out

11277.319 --> 11280.8
definitely not fire is

11287.68 --> 11292.239
right uh prostate

11295.16 --> 11299.439
cancer technique can Cur me

11305.2 --> 11311.16
uh I don't know it's

11308.16 --> 11311.16
it

11311.92 --> 11318.88
maybe I mean I'm not like G to I'll

11315.52 --> 11322.279
contact you on Skype okay look

11318.88 --> 11324.72
it's it all depends on like what you're

11322.279 --> 11324.720000000001
doing

11325.88 --> 11331.199999999999
already and if you you're if you've

11328.439 --> 11332.319
undergone like medical procedures and

11331.2 --> 11334.08
all

11332.319 --> 11338.6
that

11334.08 --> 11342.12
right but I mean applying the technique

11338.6 --> 11344.52
will probably at least assist you cuz I

11342.12 --> 11349.279
mean any form of cancer is basically

11344.52 --> 11349.279
part of a body system to heal

11349.76 --> 11356.68
you and the more you basically use the

11353.96 --> 11358.199999999999
allopathic system to try to intervene in

11356.68 --> 11361.52
those natural

11358.2 --> 11364.08
processes the more you risk it basically

11361.52 --> 11367.76
becoming out of

11364.08 --> 11371.479
control and applying the technique will

11367.76 --> 11375.16
help you stabilize your body to slightly

11371.479 --> 11378.0
more optimal slightly to a more optimal

11375.16 --> 11380.439
function so it's certainly worth a try

11378.0 --> 11382.439
but I mean don't expect that me applying

11380.439 --> 11384.64
the technique is just immediately going

11382.439 --> 11387.68
to make the cancer disappear overnight

11384.64 --> 11390.92
it doesn't work like that but it could C

11387.68 --> 11394.359
help your body to just work things out

11390.92 --> 11395.399
better right like I'm not claiming I can

11394.359 --> 11397.399000000001
cure

11395.399 --> 11403.278999999999
cancer with the

11397.399 --> 11406.278999999999
technique but I can help the body to

11403.279 --> 11408.880000000001
restore a more op yeah to restore to a

11406.279 --> 11412.640000000001
more optimal state in order for it to

11408.88 --> 11416.438999999998
deal with cancer which is a natural

11412.64 --> 11418.319
process of the body to repair things to

11416.439 --> 11421.56
deal with it better

11418.319 --> 11421.56
so that's what I can do for

11428.84 --> 11436.880000000001
you wants it to try yeah I will sure I

11432.12 --> 11436.880000000001
will try sure I'll help you out

11452.479 --> 11456.679999999998
right but whatever you do I'd also

11455.319 --> 11462.08
definitely

11456.68 --> 11462.08
consider uh trying for example apricot

11466.439 --> 11473.52
seeds I well I try I I personally if I

11470.12 --> 11474.640000000001
had that situation I try a whole bunch

11473.52 --> 11478.359
of

11474.64 --> 11481.72
things like different type of

11478.359 --> 11485.479000000001
supplements that really helped rate

11481.72 --> 11490.239
and and things like apricot seeds which

11485.479 --> 11494.84
is like provably helping against

11490.239 --> 11498.199999999999
cancer and I avoid any type of surgical

11494.84 --> 11501.04
intervention and yeah the the regular

11498.2 --> 11503.84
treatments because those tend to make

11501.04 --> 11507.84
make basically make things

11503.84 --> 11507.84
worse what

11510.279 --> 11513.76
oh very funny Gary

11525.0 --> 11531.359
F physical contract no we don't need

11528.92 --> 11531.359
