131.76 --> 135.06
[Music]

133.98 --> 137.06
better

135.06 --> 140.22
than yesterday

137.06 --> 142.08
I think

140.22 --> 143.16
not too much better though

142.08 --> 144.44000000000003
[Music]

143.16 --> 149.09
foreign

144.44 --> 149.09
[Music]

154.14 --> 159.42
for groceries in this um yeah that took

157.44 --> 161.28
my umbrella with me which was the best

159.42 --> 163.48
idea ever

161.28 --> 171.05
and my camera's frozen again

163.48 --> 171.04999999999998
[Music]

172.8 --> 176.36
all right so it's still

204.78 --> 210.83
foreign

206.82 --> 210.82999999999998
[Music]

264.479 --> 267.25899999999996
foreign

267.979 --> 272.3
hello hello oh my God

276.0 --> 280.699
giving me a lot of hassle today

280.74 --> 284.18
right when I'm here

286.68 --> 294.12
hello dank first in chat

289.44 --> 296.94
LSG Mike sadunich territ 3006

294.12 --> 302.1
yeah good to see you

296.94 --> 304.199
it is Friday the 18th of November 2022

302.1 --> 306.72
and yeah I will be having a bit of a

304.199 --> 308.96000000000004
short show because I started kind of

306.72 --> 308.96000000000004
late

309.06 --> 313.32
oh

311.46 --> 315.0
because I went out for groceries and it

313.32 --> 317.46
was just like

315.0 --> 320.28
yeah I keep underestimating that like

317.46 --> 321.65999999999997
going out for groceries on my bicycle in

320.28 --> 323.75899999999996
this weather

321.66 --> 326.34000000000003
I kind of need a dry up period

323.759 --> 328.38
afterwards even if I do take my umbrella

326.34 --> 331.979
with me

328.38 --> 334.5
and yeah because there's no freaking way

331.979 --> 336.06
that if I just came back that I could

334.5 --> 338.22
start like the show in five minutes

336.06 --> 340.93
there's just no way it's incredibly

338.22 --> 343.62
unpleasant for a while

340.93 --> 346.699
[Music]

343.62 --> 346.699
but uh yeah

348.06 --> 352.62
I did actually have a really good rest

350.67 --> 355.68
[Music]

352.62 --> 359.6
but yeah yesterday and today I'm having

355.68 --> 363.0
like another one of these weird

359.6 --> 366.06
constantly slightly cramped down there

363.0 --> 368.88
days which is kind of annoying it's just

366.06 --> 371.16
like this slight pain and

368.88 --> 373.02
but it's not really that bad and I know

371.16 --> 375.84000000000003
it goes away

373.02 --> 378.71999999999997
it's just distracting and I have a bit

375.84 --> 382.979
of that too but yeah then yesterday

378.72 --> 384.96000000000004
night went under the shower just pretty

382.979 --> 387.12
much to heat up

384.96 --> 391.13899999999995
and that was really good took that

387.12 --> 396.259
shower went straight into bed afterward

391.139 --> 396.259
and yeah I do feel pretty rested

399.9 --> 402.44
right

407.52 --> 412.38
so how are you guys doing I hope the

409.8 --> 414.96000000000004
weather's kind of getting better where

412.38 --> 418.8
you're at compared to here

414.96 --> 421.44
I mean I have a pretty good few weeks up

418.8 --> 424.039
until like

421.44 --> 424.039
Monday

427.259 --> 429.86
ah

437.699 --> 441.5
snowed most of the day yeah yeah

441.78 --> 446.17999999999995
it's snowing in the shower you told me

452.22 --> 455.12
right

456.9 --> 462.23999999999995
anyway uh

459.18 --> 465.36
yeah yesterday Flat Earth debate went

462.24 --> 468.56
live for like two hours 40 minutes

465.36 --> 468.56
reviewing a video

478.199 --> 484.759
is 14 to 16 degrees Celsius normal for

481.5 --> 484.759
yeah I guess

485.28 --> 489.84
I guess it is

487.56 --> 492.72
I mean it doesn't really snow here

489.84 --> 495.02
anymore like it did like in the 20th

492.72 --> 495.02000000000004
century

498.3 --> 501.96000000000004
I really enjoyed the long shot yeah it

500.34 --> 505.28
was okay

501.96 --> 505.28
it was enjoyable

508.86 --> 513.779
but yeah that was on top of that and

511.259 --> 515.6
after show and yeah

513.779 --> 518.629
it's a lot of time

515.6 --> 518.629
[Music]

522.06 --> 527.399
but yeah it was a good show yesterday

524.64 --> 529.14
and here's to see what will happen today

527.399 --> 533.36
I kind of doubt it's going to be that

529.14 --> 533.36
long a show today though I mean

534.68 --> 539.8389999999999
but we'll see maybe it will be

540.74 --> 546.77
[Music]

546.24 --> 550.6800000000001
um

546.77 --> 554.3
[Music]

550.68 --> 554.3
let's see who else

556.2 --> 559.22
oh right

562.38 --> 568.279
wait did I show share that I think I

565.5 --> 568.279
shared that yesterday

569.22 --> 571.9200000000001
yeah about the video

570.49 --> 577.339
[Music]

571.92 --> 577.3389999999999
from mine unveiled at the photo trickery

579.72 --> 584.9590000000001
very interesting video

582.12 --> 584.9590000000001
uh

585.42 --> 589.2199999999999
let's see who else

597.56 --> 603.42
flat side again flat side's going live

600.42 --> 607.0999999999999
every day these days

603.42 --> 607.0999999999999
but yeah it's a fun show to be around

608.899 --> 613.32
the PGA Cruise shank really likes to

611.58 --> 616.4590000000001
hang around there

613.32 --> 616.4590000000001
I don't blame him

616.62 --> 619.519
uh

643.74 --> 650.5790000000001
all right yeah yeah no of course I mean

645.899 --> 651.54
I agree fpd is the best every yeah Flat

650.579 --> 657.0
Earth

651.54 --> 659.16
show in the world I I really agree

657.0 --> 662.12
I mean there might be really good video

659.16 --> 662.12
makers out there

662.64 --> 668.1
but

663.779 --> 670.62
the FED is the best Interactive

668.1 --> 672.0
Think Tank show you could basically call

670.62 --> 675.0
it

672.0 --> 678.56
where we're a little Think Tank and we

675.0 --> 678.56
stay on Flat Earth

679.5 --> 685.019
except for ball win but yeah you know

682.32 --> 687.9200000000001
what that means anyway

685.019 --> 687.92
I agree

691.32 --> 696.3000000000001
this is the best letter of the show okay

694.26 --> 699.4399999999999
fair enough

696.3 --> 699.4399999999999
not gonna complain

700.079 --> 705.41
I'd like to see that in in PayPal

702.42 --> 707.0999999999999
appreciation though but uh

705.41 --> 709.86
[Music]

707.1 --> 713.94
I do like my show I do like what I put

709.86 --> 717.48
down even though it is like

713.94 --> 719.6
a bit weird in its format meaning just

717.48 --> 722.339
me live every day

719.6 --> 724.32
including with just silent pauses me

722.339 --> 726.1800000000001
kind of staring at the chat figuring out

724.32 --> 730.019
what to talk about

726.18 --> 732.54
but hey once I once something hits off

730.019 --> 733.88
you know what happens I get really

732.54 --> 737.5999999999999
detailed

733.88 --> 737.6
esoteric everything

738.12 --> 742.68
so

739.26 --> 746.8199999999999
yeah I do appreciate my own shows

742.68 --> 749.16
but yeah since I'm doing them every day

746.82 --> 751.38
like it's kind of harder to be your own

749.16 --> 753.959
fan if you're just doing a show every

751.38 --> 758.6
day because I do not have time to watch

753.959 --> 758.5999999999999
my show back every day I just don't

766.8 --> 772.8
right yeah and Baldwin is very

770.16 --> 775.38
entertaining to be like

772.8 --> 778.019
although I do it does really stand out

775.38 --> 779.06
to me more that Nathan just has a lot of

778.019 --> 784.26
trouble

779.06 --> 787.26
distinguishing between Baldwin and Arwin

784.26 --> 789.72
I like every time I have to like point

787.26 --> 791.8199999999999
it out to them like I'm being Bowie now

789.72 --> 793.86
oh no I'm not being Baldwin now because

791.82 --> 795.1800000000001
it just seems to assume I'm always

793.86 --> 798.0600000000001
Baldwin

795.18 --> 800.6389999999999
maybe he thinks now that my actual Flat

798.06 --> 804.1199999999999
Earth our win position is like an

800.639 --> 805.139
undercover Act of Baldwin or something I

804.12 --> 806.76
don't know

805.139 --> 809.36
maybe it feels like that little

806.76 --> 809.36
sometimes

811.56 --> 814.459
but uh

815.16 --> 819.86
hey hello Nathan Oakley good to see you

823.32 --> 830.639
please let me officially tell you that

827.459 --> 832.079
our win is not an undercover Act of

830.639 --> 836.48
balwyn

832.079 --> 836.4799999999999
although he likes to think it is

836.519 --> 843.0
but it doesn't mean it actually is

840.06 --> 846.959
it's kind of like the kid who's

843.0 --> 849.779
imagining that his parents are actually

846.959 --> 851.16
his slaves and he is their boss that

849.779 --> 854.16
kind of a thing

851.16 --> 856.139
that might occur but I don't know I try

854.16 --> 860.459
to keep ball wins

856.139 --> 862.5600000000001
like territorial type like feelings and

860.459 --> 863.88
social behavior as much out of the loop

862.56 --> 866.16
as possible

863.88 --> 869.67
because it's just as

866.16 --> 872.88
complicated as our win's feelings

869.67 --> 875.519
[Music]

872.88 --> 879.36
right but I definitely do not give him a

875.519 --> 882.98
ground to to try and get Ohio mighty

879.36 --> 891.279
except if it's really funny in a moment

882.98 --> 891.279
[Music]

909.44 --> 915.36
developing multiple personalities

912.779 --> 918.54
okay

915.36 --> 921.36
fun side project yeah but the weird

918.54 --> 924.3
thing actually Aries 106 is that it is

921.36 --> 926.6990000000001
actually the main project

924.3 --> 929.8199999999999
you see it is like a microcosm

926.699 --> 934.199
simulation of the entire

929.82 --> 937.5
philosophical struggle predicament

934.199 --> 939.899
because everybody has these

937.5 --> 942.62
psychological mechanisms that I have

939.899 --> 942.62
basically

942.959 --> 948.8
like kept alive and then basically put

947.279 --> 952.079
on expose

948.8 --> 954.24
everybody has that in them

952.079 --> 959.3389999999999
but they let their

954.24 --> 962.339
their ego drive just overrule everything

959.339 --> 965.4590000000001
so they'll never admit it

962.339 --> 969.7
they'll never even show their sensitive

965.459 --> 975.4799999999999
side about it like Baldwin actually does

969.7 --> 977.279
[Music]

975.48 --> 979.26
right

977.279 --> 983.279
but

979.26 --> 984.72
even thinking back like 20 years ago

983.279 --> 987.48
and more

984.72 --> 992.1600000000001
it's just that

987.48 --> 992.16
Baldwin could have only survived

992.579 --> 997.3199999999999
if

994.019 --> 999.72
I admitted to myself that the Earth

997.32 --> 1004.36
isn't actually a ball and that it's just

999.72 --> 1004.36
a dream we're chasing together forever

1009.139 --> 1015.199
and that's really the condition that

1011.3 --> 1017.9799999999999
allowed me to basically develop these

1015.199 --> 1022.0
sub personalities of myself these

1017.98 --> 1022.0
simulacrums Within Myself

1022.279 --> 1028.939
in a stabilized fashion

1024.559 --> 1034.16
with productivity yeah because if I'd

1028.939 --> 1036.679
actually held a no no it is a globe

1034.16 --> 1039.919
I'm oh oh so I can't trust my senses

1036.679 --> 1042.02
will I [ __ ] my senses huh we see curve

1039.919 --> 1043.939
yeah if I'd gone there it would have

1042.02 --> 1047.66
been all the [ __ ] I would have been

1043.939 --> 1049.88
literally an unbearable maybe slightly

1047.66 --> 1051.38
more pretty and definitely more

1049.88 --> 1053.8400000000001
well-spoken fight the Flat Earth

1051.38 --> 1056.179
character okay but I would have been

1053.84 --> 1058.8799999999999
annoying as [ __ ]

1056.179 --> 1062.5
and it would not have been

1058.88 --> 1062.5
intellectually stimulating

1065.9 --> 1071.48
and by the way very miserable way of

1068.6 --> 1073.539
living in general which you'll be very

1071.48 --> 1076.7
good at denying that that's the case

1073.539 --> 1080.12
anti-flat earthers I know

1076.7 --> 1083.0
you spend all your time pretending like

1080.12 --> 1085.1599999999999
it's so great to be a baller so great to

1083.0 --> 1087.74
be part of the consensus

1085.16 --> 1090.22
just like the really [ __ ] up

1087.74 --> 1094.52
psychopath politicians

1090.22 --> 1096.8600000000001
always always have this veneer of like I

1094.52 --> 1099.44
am the best I'm so awesome everybody

1096.86 --> 1101.6599999999999
wants to be like me while in reality

1099.44 --> 1104.3600000000001
that's all an act and they're really

1101.66 --> 1106.039
[ __ ] miserable and like don't even

1104.36 --> 1107.84
feel human anymore

1106.039 --> 1109.76
inside

1107.84 --> 1113.059
that's what really happens to Flat Earth

1109.76 --> 1116.9
and what happens to a lot of like

1113.059 --> 1120.02
dark evil politicians

1116.9 --> 1125.02
well I didn't want to do that though

1120.02 --> 1127.4
because I actually liked the game

1125.02 --> 1130.76
like the ball

1127.4 --> 1132.98
cosmology game the imagination game I

1130.76 --> 1135.74
liked it I liked it as a kid

1132.98 --> 1138.5
it did Shine through it's not real it's

1135.74 --> 1141.799
just that on the long run

1138.5 --> 1143.96
it wasn't that the ball wasn't real

1141.799 --> 1148.6399999999999
that's the problem

1143.96 --> 1153.38
it was that Humanity would be trapped in

1148.64 --> 1157.46
a demonic Insanity to try and defend

1153.38 --> 1160.23
the ball from reality itself

1157.46 --> 1164.9
that was the real problem

[Music]

1164.9 --> 1171.46
that was the problem I couldn't handle

1168.679 --> 1171.46
the pressure

1174.5 --> 1179.48
because I wanted to just like can we now

1176.84 --> 1181.22
start talking about what the reality is

1179.48 --> 1184.28
because if we figure out what the

1181.22 --> 1186.8600000000001
reality is then we can better create our

1184.28 --> 1191.059
ball fantasies that everybody loves like

1186.86 --> 1193.76
that was my open my open attitude like

1191.059 --> 1195.6789999999999
20 years ago and it didn't work because

1193.76 --> 1199.039
some people would then come up to me and

1195.679 --> 1201.26
like like shut up like you need to shut

1199.039 --> 1204.1
up now or we're gonna like be really

1201.26 --> 1204.1
angry at you

1205.28 --> 1209.12
for even just opening the thoughts about

1208.039 --> 1212.539
it

1209.12 --> 1218.4299999999998
yeah that's what I faced back then

knowing the Earth is flat

1414.799 --> 1420.9189999999999
he is a priest

he is a priest that tells you yeah yeah

you can think of it as a ball

can we get the r value in order to

establish the radius of Earth in order

to get that r value yeah yeah

1509.72 --> 1513.679
yeah yeah

1510.58 --> 1516.4399999999998
so to actually Master the information

1513.679 --> 1519.5590000000002
you have to know what's real yeah I've

that's 10th Man Haiti no 10th man's

1824.539 --> 1829.0

sometimes he just thinks that I'm the

Antichrist or something or maybe doesn't

1833.899 --> 1837.5
think it but there certainly acts like

1836.0 --> 1840.44
that

1837.5 --> 1843.74
right because I'm not allowed to ever

1840.44 --> 1847.279
have any kind of fragility

1843.74 --> 1849.26
or outrage or social out spread of any

whining about why I shouldn't be part of

it

1866.38 --> 1875.179

1871.399 --> 1877.52
yeah so I mostly just ignore it

1875.179 --> 1880.279
and then it goes away again and then

1877.52 --> 1883.279
suddenly yeah I get out of it I get

1880.279 --> 1887.779
civil and then he's like oh my God he is

nice after all yeah tenth yeah yeah I am

you should know that now we've been

1913.039 --> 1918.08

a sextant

which is great love that you do that

from the start and I'm not gonna go away

1977.539 --> 1983.84
your idiot Christianity form yeah

1980.659 --> 1987.38
I'll just follow Christ and not some

stupid chant and definitely not

1987.38 --> 1993.5
some disgusting

1990.02 --> 1997.039
person that ever even met him

1993.5 --> 1999.679
who he warned about specifically

1999.679 --> 2004.419
would say that they see God yeah oh then

2002.26 --> 2006.46
it happened and now everybody believes

2110.75 --> 2116.719
[Music]

2124.599 --> 2131.92
you mentioned the vertical yeah

2127.66 --> 2134.7999999999997
well the thing was Welsh rice

2131.92 --> 2137.6800000000003
the thing was I wasn't even trying to be

2134.8 --> 2139.78
Baldwin about it it was just a technical

2137.68 --> 2143.14
a pure technical

2139.78 --> 2145.2400000000002
and that was later understood but when I

2143.14 --> 2147.5789999999997
was doing it everybody was like oh

2145.24 --> 2149.6189999999997
you're trying to escape from the

2147.579 --> 2152.5
realization that you need a flat Earth

2149.619 --> 2156.48
for absolutely everything which is true

2152.5 --> 2156.48
they were just over focused on that

2158.56 --> 2164.16
hey bro

2160.54 --> 2164.16
get the [ __ ] out

2169.3 --> 2173.82
I don't need your stupid commentary you

2171.579 --> 2173.82
hear

2174.16 --> 2179.74
if I want to say Welsh rights then I

2177.339 --> 2182.44
will say Welsh rice

2179.74 --> 2185.2
yeah I don't need somebody else to tell

2182.44 --> 2187.7200000000003
me that if he'd tell me that I'd listen

2185.2 --> 2191.3199999999997
because it's him it's his name

2187.72 --> 2193.8999999999996
yeah I don't need some [ __ ] outsider

2191.32 --> 2198.119
to try and tell me how things are you

2193.9 --> 2198.119
got it [ __ ] now [ __ ] off

2199.42 --> 2201.66
foreign

2203.78 --> 2211.039
[Music]

2213.74 --> 2217.3999999999996
[Music]

2218.8 --> 2223.3
right but yeah they were over focusing

2221.38 --> 2227.7400000000002
on

2223.3 --> 2230.1400000000003
oh you're trying to avoid the the in

2227.74 --> 2231.52
yeah the invocation of

2230.14 --> 2234.46
foreign

2231.52 --> 2237.099
of a flat plane needed and yeah

2234.46 --> 2240.0
but that wasn't my point my point was

2237.099 --> 2243.119
like purely like

2240.0 --> 2246.4
spiritlessly mechanical you understand

2243.119 --> 2249.52
spiritlessly mechanical as in any body

2246.4 --> 2252.1600000000003
could step in there because it's only my

2249.52 --> 2254.079
point was only technical only

2252.16 --> 2257.0789999999997
had nothing to do

2254.079 --> 2259.7200000000003
with oh I'm secretly trying to help the

2257.079 --> 2262.54
ball or something avoid

2259.72 --> 2265.839
needing that Flat Earth for their claim

2262.54 --> 2268.54
no no I wasn't I even like pretty much

2265.839 --> 2270.93
admitted that like yeah yeah I know I

2268.54 --> 2273.339
know but it's not about that

2270.93 --> 2275.859
[Music]

2273.339 --> 2277.96
but yeah the guys were just really like

2275.859 --> 2281.46
where are we gonna get him we're gonna

2277.96 --> 2281.46
get you this time Ballin

2283.18 --> 2288.2799999999997
and yeah Nathan was kind of rumpusy

2285.7 --> 2290.14
about it and that that really yeah when

2288.28 --> 2292.5400000000004
I just can't get my message out yeah

2290.14 --> 2294.0989999999997
then I get emotional in these types of

2292.54 --> 2296.7599999999998
moments when I'm like a little extra

2294.099 --> 2296.76
sensitive

2296.92 --> 2303.099
and then I have a burst outbursts and

2299.68 --> 2305.02
then everybody it's like I like I'm just

2303.099 --> 2307.48
moving by with a torch and just set

2305.02 --> 2312.18
everybody on fire because every time I

2307.48 --> 2312.18
do that everybody goes all nuts over it

2313.839 --> 2319.599
all right but these things just happen I

2317.8 --> 2321.6400000000003
just have these moments where I don't

2319.599 --> 2323.6800000000003
really understand why but I just get

2321.64 --> 2326.68
super over sensitive and have an

2323.68 --> 2329.98
overreaction there's literally nothing

2326.68 --> 2333.46
in the world that I can do

2329.98 --> 2335.859
to stop that from happening when it does

2333.46 --> 2339.339
especially because there is no way to

2335.859 --> 2342.04
see it coming I mean I could guess it

2339.339 --> 2345.2799999999997
but you never really know

2342.04 --> 2348.52
when that shit's gonna happen

2345.28 --> 2351.28
because if I see it if ahead of time I

2348.52 --> 2354.13
would anticipate and take it easy and

2351.28 --> 2357.38
all that right I do that plenty

2354.13 --> 2357.38
[Music]

2364.63 --> 2367.84
[Music]

2370.3 --> 2375.3390000000004
I did with my emotions control me like

2372.22 --> 2377.74
that yeah it is disruptive but that's

2375.339 --> 2381.96
why it's so critical that if you're

2377.74 --> 2388.1189999999997
gonna get disrupted you'll need a really

2381.96 --> 2390.4
good plan and principles to guide you

2388.119 --> 2392.32
that's the only thing in such moment

2390.4 --> 2395.32
that'll save you because if you don't

2392.32 --> 2398.26
you're [ __ ] then the emotions will

2395.32 --> 2400.3
literally start breaking the world into

2398.26 --> 2402.0400000000004
pieces around you

2400.3 --> 2404.619
the only thing that prevents that from

2402.04 --> 2407.74
happening in moments like that is

2404.619 --> 2411.099
strict rigid principles that no matter

2407.74 --> 2415.5299999999997
how you feel you will always follow them

2411.099 --> 2417.099
it needs to also be possible to do that

2415.53 --> 2419.32
[Music]

2417.099 --> 2423.7000000000003
doesn't work if you don't have a system

2419.32 --> 2425.28
that you cannot access when you're upset

2423.7 --> 2432.46
foreign

2425.28 --> 2434.5
[Music]

2432.46 --> 2437.56
but anyway that's the point of emotions

2434.5 --> 2439.66
you know emotions are there to overrule

2437.56 --> 2443.32
you

2439.66 --> 2446.8799999999997
they are a mechanism that prevents you

2443.32 --> 2449.92
from totally internalizing all stress

2446.88 --> 2452.859
and forcing yourself into a position of

2449.92 --> 2455.079
a robot where you will not be managing

2452.859 --> 2458.0789999999997
your stress anymore but instead only

2455.079 --> 2461.32
internalizing it then if you keep doing

2458.079 --> 2463.8390000000004
that your emotions will be like uh

2461.32 --> 2466.42
emergency emergency

2463.839 --> 2469.18
you're gonna have a heart attack if you

2466.42 --> 2471.88
don't if you don't act out

2469.18 --> 2472.66
yeah that's not a joke it's not that can

2471.88 --> 2474.88
happen

2472.66 --> 2478.48
that can happen

2474.88 --> 2481.6600000000003
right emotions are there to make sure

2478.48 --> 2485.22
that it's like getting the steam off to

2481.66 --> 2485.22
prevent the tank from blowing

2485.49 --> 2490.66
[Music]

2487.48 --> 2492.96
right so that you don't over roboticize

2490.66 --> 2492.96
yourself

2496.0 --> 2501.099
because roboticizing yourself means

2498.94 --> 2503.7000000000003
you're going to be internalizing

2501.099 --> 2503.7000000000003
stresses

2505.0 --> 2510.52
but if you then keep doing that in some

2508.0 --> 2512.8
kind of workaholic maneuver and you

2510.52 --> 2515.32
don't let go then it's going to build up

2512.8 --> 2517.54
to a critical mass and then literally

2515.32 --> 2520.599
give you a heart attack if you do not

2517.54 --> 2521.859
actively try to step out of it and get

2520.599 --> 2524.079
rid of that

2521.859 --> 2526.2999999999997
and a lot of people don't

2524.079 --> 2528.76
typical Workaholics for example don't

2526.3 --> 2531.3390000000004
they just don't do that

2528.76 --> 2533.5
and then at some point they either get a

2531.339 --> 2536.0789999999997
heart attack or they get into a massive

2533.5 --> 2537.3
fight with a friend or their spouse

2536.079 --> 2540.4390000000003
that's what happens

2537.3 --> 2540.4390000000003
[Music]

2546.02 --> 2551.98
[Music]

2549.52 --> 2556.54
right

2551.98 --> 2561.9
so yeah I learned that I do not [ __ ]

2556.54 --> 2561.9
internalize my stress for anyone

2562.06 --> 2566.92
don't do it

2563.859 --> 2569.92
so technically if I go somewhere I'm

2566.92 --> 2573.46
gonna like have a job of any sort even

2569.92 --> 2575.44
small in a way Nathan is my boss he is a

2573.46 --> 2577.66
boss in this job even though I don't get

2575.44 --> 2579.88
paid it is still effectively a team

2577.66 --> 2583.42
effort it is a job

2579.88 --> 2586.48
well I can handle being there because

2583.42 --> 2589.1800000000003
Nathan knows that I work this way and

2586.48 --> 2592.06
that I have these moments his experience

2589.18 --> 2594.22
like he's experienced that like 10 times

2592.06 --> 2596.14
now or something and at the first few

2594.22 --> 2597.339
times he was really like whoa what's

2596.14 --> 2600.5789999999997
going on

2597.339 --> 2604.319
like are like is he gone insane he

2600.579 --> 2604.319
didn't understand he gets it now

2607.78 --> 2613.44
right well I couldn't work

2610.9 --> 2616.42
in any kind of job

2613.44 --> 2618.96
that had a boss that would not

2616.42 --> 2618.96
understand

2619.42 --> 2623.859
because I'd be literally get into

2621.76 --> 2627.4
trouble that way first trying to

2623.859 --> 2629.619
internalize issues I have with everybody

2627.4 --> 2632.079
and then eventually stress building up

2629.619 --> 2634.2400000000002
and then crazy moments and then yeah

2632.079 --> 2635.7400000000002
they'll not have understanding and just

2634.24 --> 2638.7
like yeah you're not for this place

2635.74 --> 2638.7
that's what would happen

2646.26 --> 2652.96
safely then yeah but the problem is the

2649.9 --> 2655.3
only way to actually safely vent

2652.96 --> 2658.18
is to confront

2655.3 --> 2660.88
because yeah oh oh my boss is an [ __ ]

2658.18 --> 2662.56
well you can whine all day long to your

2660.88 --> 2664.9
wife about that

2662.56 --> 2666.46
or to your buddies we're probably not

2664.9 --> 2667.54
going to be your buddies for too much

2666.46 --> 2669.76
longer

2667.54 --> 2672.64
unless you like pay them beer or

2669.76 --> 2675.4
something right

2672.64 --> 2678.7
that's not actually helping you're gonna

2675.4 --> 2680.56
you're just you'll just keep sitting on

2678.7 --> 2683.7999999999997
it right because the only way to

2680.56 --> 2689.5
actually vent is to confront

2683.8 --> 2691.78
that's the only way yeah the only way to

2689.5 --> 2693.7
actually deal with it oh oh wait I'm

2691.78 --> 2697.2400000000002
gonna oh that's gonna make things harder

2693.7 --> 2700.54
and oh I might lose my job yeah oh too

2697.24 --> 2703.359
[ __ ] bad because that's how it works

2700.54 --> 2706.06
yeah you got stresses you're

2703.359 --> 2710.74
internalizing them well guess what the

2706.06 --> 2714.099
only way to deal with it is face it head

2710.74 --> 2715.06
on if you don't you're gonna be sitting

2714.099 --> 2720.04
on it

2715.06 --> 2720.04
having it drag you down forever

2721.51 --> 2737.7290000000003
[Music]

2744.46 --> 2749.2
you think a rigorous exercise has a

2747.46 --> 2752.88
similar effect instead of showing

2749.2 --> 2752.8799999999997
emotions to prevent health issues

2753.359 --> 2762.06
well exercise is a good way if you're

2757.24 --> 2762.06
not able to confront your issues head on

2762.88 --> 2770.98
then it's a symptomatic it's a symptom

2768.16 --> 2774.22
tactic you see Steam Traveler

2770.98 --> 2777.46
use sporting what it does is literally

2774.22 --> 2779.68
give your body more blood flow

2777.46 --> 2783.4
more distraction

2779.68 --> 2785.7999999999997
in order to kind of like undo some of

2783.4 --> 2787.96
the damage of this dress so it basically

2785.8 --> 2791.44
compensates you with like what is that

2787.96 --> 2793.9
body of euphoria of exercising

2791.44 --> 2797.26
and gives you blood flow to basically

2793.9 --> 2799.6600000000003
make to counteract the tightening the

2797.26 --> 2800.6800000000003
typical tightening of veins that stress

2799.66 --> 2804.7599999999998
causes

2800.68 --> 2807.64
so it is a symptom uh tactic

2804.76 --> 2811.2400000000002
to battle the symptoms but it it's not

2807.64 --> 2813.64
actually gonna get rid of the the root

2811.24 --> 2816.8799999999997
cause the only way only thing that does

2813.64 --> 2819.8799999999997
is is going at it head on

2816.88 --> 2822.819
the only way it actually can be resolved

2819.88 --> 2824.819
and like be rerouted where this stress

2822.819 --> 2827.98
energy that's just sitting there like

2824.819 --> 2831.339
can be

2827.98 --> 2833.7400000000002
and suddenly the energy isn't an

2831.339 --> 2836.2
obstruction no now it has a function and

2833.74 --> 2839.74
now it has a purpose and then it's all

2836.2 --> 2842.2799999999997
good the only way to achieve it is to go

2839.74 --> 2842.2799999999997
ahead on

2842.74 --> 2848.2599999999998
but if you just can't then yeah sporting

2846.46 --> 2853.18
is a good way

2848.26 --> 2855.2200000000003
to battle the symptoms of the stress

2853.18 --> 2857.2
it's not going to get rid of it though

2855.22 --> 2859.839
keep that in mind

2857.2 --> 2862.18
yeah a lot of people that are always

2859.839 --> 2865.72
supporting they're actually kind of

2862.18 --> 2867.7599999999998
Escapist they're usually like not very

2865.72 --> 2870.5789999999997
good at confrontation

2867.76 --> 2872.8590000000004
so they learn sporting to deal with it

2870.579 --> 2878.02
and not have mental breakdowns

2872.859 --> 2881.0989999999997
but yeah because that symptom tactic

2878.02 --> 2883.66
they actually need less

2881.099 --> 2887.319
less necessity

2883.66 --> 2889.54
in the moment to actually go at it

2887.319 --> 2893.079
add-on and face it and that's why they

2889.54 --> 2897.24
keep stuck so it's a tricky thing

2893.079 --> 2900.819
we use Sports to combat stress

2897.24 --> 2903.0989999999997
then yeah it's almost like using

2900.819 --> 2904.9
painkillers because you got some pain

2903.099 --> 2907.3590000000004
somewhere oh guess what you're gonna

2904.9 --> 2909.579
keep getting it

2907.359 --> 2911.56
and now the painkiller eventually then

2909.579 --> 2913.119
even like if you stop taking it you'll

2911.56 --> 2916.599
just get pain

2913.119 --> 2918.819
yeah well Sports may have a similar

2916.599 --> 2920.8
effect

2918.819 --> 2923.74
right

2920.8 --> 2926.26
but hey if you have acute stress and you

2923.74 --> 2928.66
have absolutely no way to deal with it

2926.26 --> 2931.5600000000004
you know then yeah of course you're

2928.66 --> 2934.72
gonna do sporting of course I mean

2931.56 --> 2937.14
like a weird weird example is like oh

2934.72 --> 2938.68
you have a family get-together

2937.14 --> 2941.56
and

2938.68 --> 2943.7799999999997
somebody is like in your family is like

2941.56 --> 2946.9
making your wife or your husband is

2943.78 --> 2949.6600000000003
making a total piece of [ __ ] ass of

2946.9 --> 2951.1600000000003
himself and they're humiliating you yeah

2949.66 --> 2954.04
well

2951.16 --> 2955.839
but yeah if you face that hat on you

2954.04 --> 2957.819
might just like oh boom there it goes

2955.839 --> 2961.619
you're married forever right

2957.819 --> 2965.8
or you could get out and like

2961.619 --> 2969.099
I'm gonna jog like [ __ ] right and just

2965.8 --> 2971.26
hope it gets better after that that's a

2969.099 --> 2973.1800000000003
reasonable act it's a reasonable

2971.26 --> 2975.099
decision to do that in such a moment

2973.18 --> 2976.18
right because otherwise it might blow to

2975.099 --> 2979.0
all hell

2976.18 --> 2982.06
right but if you're gonna keep doing

2979.0 --> 2984.339
that yeah and your spouse keeps doing

2982.06 --> 2986.2
that same action and then every time you

2984.339 --> 2987.819
have to go jog well now you got a

2986.2 --> 2993.04
problem because now you're basically

2987.819 --> 2993.04
taking a drug to escape confrontation

2995.7 --> 3002.2799999999997

what are they doing it for

3039.42 --> 3042.66
what are they putting in the back of

3041.579 --> 3044.7000000000003
their mind

3042.66 --> 3046.5789999999997
how consistently are they pulling

putting it in the back of their mind

3046.579 --> 3054.119
right how are they jogging because it

3049.619 --> 3057.42
tells a lot about what they're like

3054.119 --> 3059.96
what kind of a social person they are

3057.42 --> 3059.96

3165.24 --> 3169.9799999999996
dude Neil could be like the fittest man

3167.88 --> 3173.579
in the world

3169.98 --> 3178.26
if he'd be like jogging

3173.579 --> 3179.76
during fed because he's like I'm gonna

that's also why I turned the super chats

3202.5 --> 3206.88
off

3203.64 --> 3208.68
I mean if I get a lot more income then

3206.88 --> 3211.26
eventually I could kind of turn it back

3208.68 --> 3214.68
on again but right now like the whole

3211.26 --> 3216.3
thing is not enough for me to bypass

3214.68 --> 3219.7799999999997
like the

3216.3 --> 3223.26
my social welfare amount

3219.78 --> 3226.6000000000004
so any income I get directly from Google

3223.26 --> 3227.94

3226.6 --> 3229.88

3227.94 --> 3235.28

3477.0 --> 3484.14
Society migrates culturally more and

3481.319 --> 3486.24
more and more and more and more towards

3484.14 --> 3488.2799999999997
the Amish

3486.24 --> 3490.3799999999997

3488.28 --> 3493.1400000000003
not saying like everybody everything

3490.38 --> 3496.2000000000003
should be exactly like the Amish but I'm

3493.14 --> 3498.54
saying I want to see it migrate in that

3496.2 --> 3500.73
direction more and more

3498.54 --> 3507.909

3500.73 --> 3507.909
[Music]

3509.88 --> 3515.04

3515.04 --> 3519.0
something

3516.42 --> 3522.0
a moment or a place where people

3519.0 --> 3524.96
literally will be like yeah we don't use

3522.0 --> 3524.96
mobile phones

3562.559 --> 3568.6800000000003
that's ridiculous Aries that's literally

3565.339 --> 3573.74
self-contradicting traditionalism and

3568.68 --> 3573.74
futurism are literally counter opposite

3574.74 --> 3578.339
it's like

3575.94 --> 3580.619
the whole point of traditionalism is not

3578.339 --> 3584.18
to change the whole point of futurism is

3580.619 --> 3584.1800000000003
for everything to change

3585.9 --> 3591.63
you can't have a balance like between a

new series on Netflix and I'm almost

3687.059 --> 3691.619
already sorry since of course it had

3689.64 --> 3694.14
freaking gay in it

3691.619 --> 3696.299
but in this case I can't complain too

3694.14 --> 3699.9
much because it was kind of a gay in

3696.299 --> 3701.579
context since it was historical

3699.9 --> 3703.02
was sort of historical it was

3701.579 --> 3705.599
interesting

3703.02 --> 3706.74
but it's a new series by the same makers

3705.599 --> 3711.6800000000003
of dark

3706.74 --> 3711.68
that that time-based mystery

3712.619 --> 3719.46
sci-fi series from a while ago don't

3716.46 --> 3722.4
know if you remember it dark German it's

3719.46 --> 3724.619
like an exclusive German series well

3722.4 --> 3726.7200000000003
this series is multi-lang yeah that's

3724.619 --> 3729.2000000000003
right 1899

3726.72 --> 3733.3799999999997
multilingual

3729.2 --> 3736.4399999999996
and very interesting thus far like three

3733.38 --> 3740.339
episodes in but unfortunately they had

3736.44 --> 3743.28
to do on like full-on gay soft porn [ __ ]

3740.339 --> 3745.92
they hate it

3743.28 --> 3747.78
I hate that crap I don't want to know

3745.92 --> 3749.76
they could have cut that whole scene out

3747.78 --> 3752.4
and just be freaking innuendo like oh

3749.76 --> 3756.8590000000004
they're actually gay yeah good fine move

3752.4 --> 3756.859
on I don't want to [ __ ] see that

3757.64 --> 3767.52
even though yeah it's in context yeah

3761.339 --> 3770.099
Spain very very anti-gay so yeah yeah oh

3767.52 --> 3773.28
cool it's historical oh yeah you got

3770.099 --> 3776.88
actually got a reason to have gays oh

3773.28 --> 3780.48
cool for you now [ __ ] skip on the

3776.88 --> 3783.0
goddamn porn [ __ ]

3780.48 --> 3787.98
I hate that

3783.0 --> 3790.98
skip those scenes just delete

3787.98 --> 3794.099
like two seconds

3790.98 --> 3797.52
I mean look at them kiss or something

3794.099 --> 3799.319
and then click next scene people get it

3797.52 --> 3801.92
what's gonna happen they we don't wanna

3799.319 --> 3801.92
see it

3801.96 --> 3807.44
ah

3804.78 --> 3807.44
foreign

3808.099 --> 3813.059

3811.559 --> 3817.6800000000003
big mystery

3813.059 --> 3819.8390000000004
Ghost Ship historical piece and

3817.68 --> 3822.66
I mean these guys that make this series

3819.839 --> 3825.24
just like with dark they're very

3822.66 --> 3827.5789999999997
creative and very systematic and they

3825.24 --> 3829.5
always like to involve weird time [ __ ]

3827.579 --> 3832.26
for some reason they're really good with

3829.5 --> 3835.26
it I I can almost feel like how they're

3832.26 --> 3837.98
making it they make this puzzle it's

3835.26 --> 3840.48
like time is a puzzle they create these

3837.98 --> 3844.5
these stories

3840.48 --> 3846.72
through a non-time linear way and I get

3844.5 --> 3849.54
the feeling that I know like how they're

3846.72 --> 3853.5589999999997
doing it it's very weird

3849.54 --> 3857.2799999999997
but it's interesting and I really like

3853.559 --> 3859.1400000000003
main character in this series little

3857.28 --> 3861.3590000000004

3952.38 --> 3957.7200000000003
interesting but it also has gay in it

3955.68 --> 3960.5989999999997
and I did not like that

3957.72 --> 3961.5
I mean at least dark just didn't do that

3960.599 --> 3964.38
[ __ ]

3961.5 --> 3966.839
kept it very small

3964.38 --> 3968.88
this thing it's kind of like oh won some

3966.839 --> 3970.98
of the main characters is about their

3968.88 --> 3973.98
secret Gators

3970.98 --> 3973.98
uh

3974.099 --> 3981.059

3978.48 --> 3984.18
I hate that

3981.059 --> 3987.2400000000002
and even like watching this it makes me

3984.18 --> 3990.359
nostalgic for those times like oh God

3987.24 --> 3992.3999999999996
can we please go back to a time where

3990.359 --> 3994.68
it's just illegal again

3992.4 --> 3998.64
and people like that have to do it in

3994.68 --> 4002.2599999999998
secret please for the love of God

3998.64 --> 4002.2599999999998

4007.23 --> 4011.48
[Music]

4027.819 --> 4033.339

4033.559 --> 4040.809
why I mean I've watched some but

4036.23 --> 4040.809
[Music]

4046.66 --> 4052.7
no gays

4048.92 --> 4055.579
[Music]

4052.7 --> 4058.0989999999997
it's not entirely true they still have

4055.579 --> 4058.9
gaze it's just that John Wayne doesn't

4058.099 --> 4060.1400000000003
respect him

4058.9 --> 4063.26
[Music]

4060.14 --> 4065.799
or in character at least

4063.26 --> 4065.7990000000004
right

4065.92 --> 4069.099
[Music]

4069.619 --> 4073.819
no but I've come already to the

4071.96 --> 4076.7
conclusion that pretty much all of

4073.819 --> 4081.52
Hollywood movies all of movies since

4076.7 --> 4083.299
movies even started all have gays

4081.52 --> 4085.819
[Music]

4083.299 --> 4088.28
they all do

4085.819 --> 4091.4
I mean there's no movies out there

4088.28 --> 4093.92
without it I think like that that is

4091.4 --> 4095.78
actually extremely rare

4093.92 --> 4098.42
so there's always some freaking gay

4095.78 --> 4101.2390000000005
influence somehow somebody that's a gay

4098.42 --> 4103.04
that's acting not to be

4101.239 --> 4106.7789999999995
or

4103.04 --> 4106.7789999999995
it's just always in there

4114.14 --> 4120.08
I mean a bent old John Wayne movies have

4117.199 --> 4121.58
gays in them it's just they're gonna be

4120.08 --> 4125.0199999999995
disrespected

4121.58 --> 4125.0199999999995
they're still be in there

4125.54 --> 4128.0199999999995
right

4129.799 --> 4131.98
foreign

4135.819 --> 4141.799
if I have to name one movie that I I

4139.279 --> 4145.400000000001
think does not have any kind of gay

4141.799 --> 4148.58
characters in it it would be blueberry

4145.4 --> 4150.8589999999995
I mean there is literally none of it

4148.58 --> 4152.839
no character that I remember actually

4150.859 --> 4156.52
has

4152.839 --> 4156.5199999999995
anything like that

4166.4 --> 4175.04
all right anyway yeah that so 1899 I do

4171.259 --> 4177.38
like it it's very interesting it's a bit

4175.04 --> 4179.359
pretentious though I did not like the

4177.38 --> 4183.56
title music at all

4179.359 --> 4185.96
like really that's stupid it was in

4183.56 --> 4188.900000000001
Wonderland song again I mean oh my God

4185.96 --> 4192.02

4188.9 --> 4194.36
freaking fourth Matrix movie use that

4192.02 --> 4197.0
[ __ ] what made you think this is a good

4194.36 --> 4201.0199999999995
idea to use that song again

4197.0 --> 4203.12
I mean it almost like breaks down the

4201.02 --> 4205.280000000001
actual tension it's like it's two

4203.12 --> 4206.96
pretensions getting Rococo you need to

4205.28 --> 4211.16
step back you need to get back to the

4206.96 --> 4215.2390000000005
Baroque and do not enter the Rococo

4211.16 --> 4217.16
yeah that means less gays less overt

4215.239 --> 4220.759999999999
stop

4217.16 --> 4222.28
making mystery and Intrigue and

4227.179 --> 4232.4
go Rococo

4228.86 --> 4235.5199999999995
don't try to suit like the

4232.4 --> 4238.159
to do it for the retards yeah it's not

4235.52 --> 4241.4800000000005

4250.52 --> 4258.76
it's sinful it's stupid

4253.699 --> 4258.759999999999
go back to the Baroque and the gothic

4258.86 --> 4261.699
had a point

4262.699 --> 4265.239
foreign

4276.58 --> 4281.36
do you think was gay in the movie like

4279.56 --> 4285.4400000000005
Star Wars

4281.36 --> 4288.86
while Obi-Wan Kenobi was probably gay

4285.44 --> 4291.739
and I mean Luke Skywalker

4288.86 --> 4294.5199999999995
at absolutely no interest in women

4291.739 --> 4294.5199999999995

4295.28 --> 4298.179
literally

4298.219 --> 4303.52
that doesn't automatically make him gay

4300.38 --> 4303.52
but he could have been

4306.44 --> 4310.82
right and I mean throughout the entire

4309.08 --> 4312.5599999999995
Series so

4310.82 --> 4315.699
[Music]

4312.56 --> 4315.6990000000005

4317.739 --> 4322.94
I don't want to talk about that every

4320.36 --> 4326.299999999999
freaking movie ever is gay it's just

4322.94 --> 4328.46
that there is shitty little influences

4326.3 --> 4331.52
in there

4328.46 --> 4334.1
Luke was asexual yeah but that doesn't

4331.52 --> 4335.96
actually exist

4334.1 --> 4338.179
not this

4335.96 --> 4340.52
according to

4338.179 --> 4343.04
making it too complicated you know

4340.52 --> 4345.64
asexual of course does exist

4343.04 --> 4345.64

4349.64 --> 4352.659000000001

4372.199 --> 4377.719
that conversation at all thanks

4375.199 --> 4380.419999999999

oh which character in this movie was gay

4380.42 --> 4385.64
yeah how about we don't talk about that

4382.82 --> 4387.86
that would be great we don't talk about

4385.64 --> 4389.6
that because I don't like talking about

God damn it the show's already almost

4409.4 --> 4411.699
over

4415.82 --> 4420.58
he did until he realized the princess

4417.739 --> 4420.58
was his sister

4421.94 --> 4427.78
well

4423.56 --> 4427.780000000001
yeah it's funny but look

4428.84 --> 4433.64
I never got the feeling like he was like

4431.239 --> 4436.58
sexually or like that his character was

4433.64 --> 4439.12
even sexually attracted to Leia

4436.58 --> 4442.82
right you just

4439.12 --> 4445.64
he referred her was like whoa

4442.82 --> 4448.34
like that's a strong woman

4445.64 --> 4451.1
like that just

4448.34 --> 4453.62
admired her

4451.1 --> 4455.84
never really got any kind of feeling of

4453.62 --> 4458.42
sexuality

4455.84 --> 4461.08
even with the kiss I mean he was like

4458.42 --> 4466.0
whoa what's going on here and then

4461.08 --> 4466.0
what just happened right he wasn't like

4466.159 --> 4470.299999999999
no

so much detail in it

like Rogue one though I really did like

yeah it's not about the space that makes

4653.6 --> 4660.26

4779.48 --> 4786.5
like really beautiful art

4782.659 --> 4790.219
which is what like pictures of planets

4786.5 --> 4792.38
and Suns and nebulas really are it's art

4790.219 --> 4794.3
and it's an art that I've come to

4792.38 --> 4797.719
appreciate

4794.3 --> 4800.0
now when you think it's literally real

4797.719 --> 4803.199
it might have a very different way of

4800.0 --> 4803.199
arriving in your head

4803.3 --> 4808.400000000001
and you have other associations but once

4806.42 --> 4810.9800000000005
you snap out of that yes this giant

4808.4 --> 4812.96
disappointment like what it's all fake

4810.98 --> 4815.36
there's nothing out there

4812.96 --> 4818.84

4815.36 --> 4820.699
total bomber but after a while you

4818.84 --> 4821.78
realize yeah it's a total bummer but

4820.699 --> 4824.178999999999
look

4821.78 --> 4825.34
this [ __ ] has been produced and out

4824.179 --> 4828.5
there

4825.34 --> 4832.1
way before I was even born

4828.5 --> 4836.239
and it's probably gonna keep going after

4832.1 --> 4838.6
I I'm dead so it's just art it's just

4836.239 --> 4842.12
something people do

4838.6 --> 4845.179
why not have a look at it as art

4842.12 --> 4847.159
and then see hey do I like this is this

4845.179 --> 4849.6990000000005

4847.159 --> 4849.699

4859.46 --> 4863.8
feeling like I was stupid or anything

4863.9 --> 4870.62
it's just a mind trick

4867.92 --> 4871.6990000000005
that has been Incorporated in our

4870.62 --> 4874.219
culture

4871.699 --> 4877.58
and that inspires people to make art

4874.219 --> 4882.02
about it and a lot of money too for

4877.58 --> 4884.3
those that really believe it's real yeah

4882.02 --> 4885.620000000001
there's that

4884.3 --> 4888.92
but

4885.62 --> 4891.44
to me mostly it's just art it's just

4888.92 --> 4893.179
science fiction I mean when you when you

4891.44 --> 4895.5199999999995
watch Lord of the Rings you're not like

4893.179 --> 4897.4400000000005
oh this is not a real world this is not

4895.52 --> 4899.080000000001
real world this is a fantasy place it

4897.44 --> 4902.54
doesn't actually exist

4899.08 --> 4904.1
I can't watch this it's also not the

4902.54 --> 4906.62
real Earth man

4904.1 --> 4909.14
terrible I'm not gonna watch this is a

4906.62 --> 4910.94
fake land it doesn't exist damn it I

4909.14 --> 4913.6990000000005
mean are you gonna do that

4910.94 --> 4917.919999999999
no of course not

4913.699 --> 4917.919999999999
because you know it's fiction

4918.739 --> 4925.339999999999
you know that so what's the problem

4922.58 --> 4928.76
the only real problem with the whole

4925.34 --> 4931.58
Space belief and all that is that there

4928.76 --> 4932.96
is this struggle about the knowing and

4931.58 --> 4935.3
not knowing

4932.96 --> 4936.86
that is what the struggle is about about

4935.3 --> 4940.1
the ignorance

4936.86 --> 4941.42
about not letting other people know it's

4940.1 --> 4944.0
fake

4941.42 --> 4945.679
because you want them to believe it's

4944.0 --> 4948.02
real because it makes them more

4945.679 --> 4950.38
malleable and they'll look up to you

4948.02 --> 4950.38
more

4951.02 --> 4955.219
and if they do know then they just know

4953.179 --> 4958.04
you're just kind of being a wizard and

4955.219 --> 4960.94
playing on their ignorance

4958.04 --> 4960.94
that's the difference

4961.04 --> 4964.34
anyway

4962.42 --> 4966.4400000000005
I'm rounding out the show it's been

4964.34 --> 4970.0
short but I thought it was pretty good

4966.44 --> 4970.0
they're rambling on

4970.1 --> 4973.719
but I think I made some good points

4975.32 --> 4979.46
right I hope it was very inspiring to

4977.719 --> 4981.199
you guys I barely addressed the chat

4979.46 --> 4982.46

4981.199 --> 4984.379999999999
