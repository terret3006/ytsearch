GoFundMe and super chats that would be

102.93 --> 113.19000000000001
much appreciated

104.07 --> 115.83
so today it's an interesting day I think

113.19 --> 119.61
there's still some chemtrails going down

115.83 --> 124.47
but yeah so it's a bit hazy still trying

119.61 --> 126.72
to kind of sunny despite that and yeah

124.47 --> 129.179
people there's a lot of kids fooling

126.72 --> 132.959
around like more of them with fireworks

129.179 --> 135.45
so the group has been fooling around in

132.959 --> 138.57
a little park over there for like the

135.45 --> 140.7
entire morning so if you hear any

138.57 --> 148.5
crackling sounds or bangs that's usually

140.7 --> 153.0
them nice day I haven't gone out for

148.5 --> 155.489
groceries yet that's also because man

153.0 --> 159.989
I've been up record late that was

155.489 --> 164.01
totally crazy totally crazy but that's

159.989 --> 168.98000000000002
so much energy yesterday oh I literally

164.01 --> 171.98
stayed up until 7:00 in the morning it's

168.98 --> 171.98
because

172.47 --> 182.43
I don't know I I had trouble kind of

175.56 --> 185.13
like getting it you know I had certain

182.43 --> 186.62
ingredients had gotten spoiled for a big

185.13 --> 189.63
meal that I've kind of been postponing

186.62 --> 191.76
need to get some new stuff for that so I

189.63 --> 193.62
didn't really have a complete meal

191.76 --> 196.2
available so I just scrapped things

193.62 --> 199.56
together yesterday and kind of got me

196.2 --> 201.83999999999997
dissatisfied like yeah I want something

199.56 --> 204.9
I feel incomplete so I thought oh yeah

201.84 --> 215.67000000000002
wait I got this Christmas package from

204.9 --> 229.34
my stepmother with Lexi's oh this like

215.67 --> 233.54999999999998
wow so I looked through vitamist

229.34 --> 235.11
and selenium well my intuition was kind

233.55 --> 237.959
of right and after I took those two

235.11 --> 239.48000000000002
supplements which was it like two at

237.959 --> 244.35
night

239.48 --> 246.66
it felt like oh it's morning so I kind

244.35 --> 253.38
of accidentally gave myself a little bit

246.66 --> 255.65
too much energy staying up until 7:00 in

253.38 --> 255.65
the morning

257.91 --> 265.56
but yeah I got up what does it wanna

263.22 --> 266.49
clock something like that no I think

265.56 --> 269.79
yeah

266.49 --> 272.49
the half-past twelve so I still feel

269.79 --> 274.65000000000003
rested enough I don't even feel like I

272.49 --> 277.53000000000003
have a big hangover usually when I feel

274.65 --> 281.15999999999997
like that the next day I'm like oh no

277.53 --> 284.13
it's just like okay makes a bit of sense

281.16 --> 287.81
though because in the normal cycle of

284.13 --> 290.58
typically getting sick well generalized

287.81 --> 292.95
getting sick especially the

290.58 --> 298.14
psychosomatic aftershock effects with me

292.95 --> 300.93
like pain fever headaches maybe a cold

298.14 --> 303.09
and then it's gone and then after it's

300.93 --> 305.55
gone there's usually moments where I get

303.09 --> 308.4
so much energy that well I can't sleep

305.55 --> 311.58
like a day sometimes two days I've had

308.4 --> 313.77
it as bad as up to a week but then I

311.58 --> 316.10999999999996
would crash after that because if you

313.77 --> 318.0
just don't get enough sleep for a long

316.11 --> 320.01
time doesn't matter if you got that

318.0 --> 322.62
extra boost your body didn't get a

320.01 --> 324.53999999999996
proper chance to heal alongside of that

322.62 --> 328.38
and then you gotta get another problem

324.54 --> 330.81
temporarily so maybe it's it's a bit of

328.38 --> 334.34
that but I also think that the

330.81 --> 337.14
supplements kind of gave me the kick

334.34 --> 338.88
apparently I really needed that d3 and

337.14 --> 342.26
selenium has always had a very good

338.88 --> 342.26
effect on me so

345.71 --> 349.69899999999996
so yeah I'm kind of heights

356.57 --> 360.96999999999997
it's not yeah I got green tea with me

361.99 --> 369.13
let's go through Chet George Sanford is

365.84 --> 372.56
here I think it was first yeah a GM

369.13 --> 376.13
patchouli open the studio 68 Missouri

372.56 --> 380.09
Bear Martin Ellen good servant for

376.13 --> 386.09
McLeod Gator fish they lie Ohio bait 60

380.09 --> 388.63
our MC james mason michael roark Amanda

386.09 --> 391.52
young yeah good to see you all

388.63 --> 394.96999999999997
they'll probably be more leaking in it's

391.52 --> 398.51
Saturday and Friday is usually a long

394.97 --> 403.70000000000005
night for a lot of people the life was

398.51 --> 406.53999999999996
very interesting as well or watch the

403.7 --> 410.36
got [ __ ] the Owen Benjamin life again

406.54 --> 413.03000000000003
very happy to see him again and it was

410.36 --> 417.13
interesting added a bit of an issue with

413.03 --> 419.57
his back it's almost weird because I

417.13 --> 422.69
just remembered like even said in his

419.57 --> 426.21999999999997
chat like ah big people like very long

422.69 --> 429.05
large people especially the tall ones

426.22 --> 432.11
but just large people in general usually

429.05 --> 433.85
tend to get more back problems as they

432.11 --> 436.37
grow older and it's kind of weird that

433.85 --> 438.11
he then especially yeah specifically had

436.37 --> 443.75
an issue with his back that was kind of

438.11 --> 447.71000000000004
odd but he got a bit spooked about it he

443.75 --> 450.2
said and yeah turn out not to be as bad

447.71 --> 451.27
and just to me it seems completely

450.2 --> 455.21
logically

451.27 --> 457.13
psychosomatic after shock effect so yeah

455.21 --> 461.84
that will typically be very bothersome

457.13 --> 464.42
and then just go away again but it's not

461.84 --> 466.34
surprising that the psychos look the

464.42 --> 470.51
whole thing about psychosomatic after

466.34 --> 473.65999999999997
effects is that they typically arrive in

470.51 --> 476.3
spots that you will get to learn as your

473.66 --> 478.19
weak spot during your lifetime as you

476.3 --> 480.95
get older it'll get weaker yeah sorry

478.19 --> 483.95
young people it's it's really like we

480.95 --> 487.21999999999997
don't care we're too young well you know

483.95 --> 489.84
it starts off very very minor and you

487.22 --> 491.58000000000004
think that it's no issue at all

489.84 --> 493.10999999999996
just don't think about it and it's

491.58 --> 495.45
literally not there anymore

493.11 --> 498.33000000000004
well eventually that comes a bit harder

495.45 --> 500.69
and more elements at to it and all that

498.33 --> 504.3
so it's a bit of a life challenge and

500.69 --> 507.63
yeah when you get somatic aftershocks

504.3 --> 511.08
from heavy experiences like what I got

507.63 --> 513.3
on a regular basis well relatively

511.08 --> 517.76
irregular and I think Owen Benjamin had

513.3 --> 520.3489999999999
they typically arrive at at weak spots

517.76 --> 524.1899999999999
you got to always be careful with those

520.349 --> 526.1400000000001
spots it's like almost like a canary in

524.19 --> 529.32
a coal mine a bit that's how I see it's

526.14 --> 532.83
like my jaw is like the annoying sensory

529.32 --> 544.47
that tells me what's going on with the

532.83 --> 546.1800000000001
cycle a lot I used to be like this weird

544.47 --> 554.1600000000001
old thing I don't know if people still

546.18 --> 556.7099999999999
know I don't know Eden shamans or no

554.16 --> 558.75
maybe not challenged typically like

556.71 --> 560.97
which is like the generalized witches

558.75 --> 566.62
they typically complain about their

560.97 --> 569.96
ailments a lot people get sick of it

566.62 --> 571.76
well that's like a perspective on the

569.96 --> 573.2
things that I'm trying to explain from

571.76 --> 579.17
my ignorant perspective that doesn't

573.2 --> 581.5400000000001
really care but there's a lot to it you

579.17 --> 585.5899999999999
learn a lot about it anyway that was

581.54 --> 587.2099999999999
that think I'm mostly restorative my jaw

585.59 --> 592.49
is like not even numb anymore

587.21 --> 602.23
still have yeah no real headache still

592.49 --> 602.23
bit tired like still needs some time to

602.41 --> 613.13
to let it all slowly restore yeah

610.82 --> 615.5500000000001
especially headaches I'm not used to

613.13 --> 615.55
headaches

618.56 --> 621.6899999999999
[Music]

625.41 --> 629.81
right love subjec Oh

632.77 --> 636.67
I am by the way also thanks for

634.779 --> 643.6
followers that actually do leave

636.67 --> 646.74
comments sometimes because well I'm

643.6 --> 650.2
really happy that you do get active and

646.74 --> 653.14
well reflect your opinion also I'm just

650.2 --> 655.899
in the comment section because I really

653.14 --> 659.26
do appreciate when you engage in the

655.899 --> 661.209
material and I really take compliments

659.26 --> 664.93
and everything to heart if they're if

661.209 --> 667.42
they're heartfelt if it's meant consents

664.93 --> 673.149
that's I don't like people sucking up to

667.42 --> 673.779
me just so you know yeah but don't worry

673.149 --> 679.649
about it

673.779 --> 682.93
if it's all heartfelt it's all good and

679.649 --> 686.05
yeah these days I do get more people in

682.93 --> 688.81
my comment section that just yeah say

686.05 --> 696.49
nice things or really ask good questions

688.81 --> 700.3599999999999
or reflect back upon issues like because

696.49 --> 703.029
I do really it's very tough to really

700.36 --> 706.32
make out like whether something went

703.029 --> 708.7
right or what is something went yeah or

706.32 --> 710.8000000000001
something went really good about it and

708.7 --> 712.72
something went really bad but if you're

710.8 --> 715.0
just gonna get somebody to just hate you

712.72 --> 717.8100000000001
they're gonna maybe point out at a flaw

715.0 --> 721.149
but that's not really gonna reveal

717.81 --> 723.9699999999999
whether how much or how it was really

721.149 --> 728.23
wrong usually it's just usually aimed an

723.97 --> 729.07
energetic leaf attuned to just say no

728.23 --> 731.86
it's all bad

729.07 --> 736.98
so getting real criticism from people

731.86 --> 740.98
that actually care that's kind of needed

736.98 --> 745.2090000000001
don't underestimate that because I think

740.98 --> 747.5500000000001
I do have a good sensory and in how to

745.209 --> 748.0889999999999
interpret like okay how good is this how

747.55 --> 750.9399999999999
bad is that

748.089 --> 752.8800000000001
but still I yeah there's always blind

750.94 --> 755.399
spots for every individual no matter how

752.88 --> 757.99
fine-tuned or smart or whatever you are

755.399 --> 759.97
there's always blind spot this is just a

757.99 --> 765.279
unique condition from consciousness I've

759.97 --> 766.3000000000001
experienced so feedback genuine feedback

765.279 --> 770.43
is

766.3 --> 775.9599999999999
kind of necessary for me it helps a lot

770.43 --> 777.6999999999999
just as much as PayPal donations donate

775.96 --> 783.7900000000001
an arrest mate how my dad how much that

777.7 --> 793.5400000000001
helps every time but that's a yeah on

783.79 --> 796.51
the on the material level anyway yes

793.54 --> 798.87
here check oh I I have a some trouble

796.51 --> 802.83
with your jock sometimes you know it's

798.87 --> 806.44
when things like are on the edge of

802.83 --> 807.61
sarcasm joke ish and also borderline

806.44 --> 812.9200000000001
baller I

807.61 --> 814.9
I appreciate these the skill but I still

812.92 --> 818.14
kind of think it's trolling it's not

814.9 --> 821.56
really that funny but I guess that it is

818.14 --> 823.75
like mild and could still be sort of

821.56 --> 827.17
considered fought it among the baller

823.75 --> 831.52
perspective but there's an issue with

827.17 --> 835.36
that I really don't care I'm not

831.52 --> 840.04
interested I'm literally not interested

835.36 --> 843.22
in any comical inspiration that may be

840.04 --> 847.93
derived from my presence here on YouTube

843.22 --> 850.09
to ballers I literally don't care

847.93 --> 852.67
because it is all anchored in reversed

850.09 --> 855.52
world thinking and feeling anyway so

852.67 --> 858.4
there's just no viability in encouraging

855.52 --> 859.96
that at all really it's tough especially

858.4 --> 862.84
there for some people that are still

859.96 --> 868.96
ballers that's kind of a reality of it

862.84 --> 873.58
so yeah I'm I really I really do in in

868.96 --> 875.89
full honesty only appreciate kind of

873.58 --> 881.49
flattered perspective humor and it can

875.89 --> 881.49
go very deep and even fractal like

881.99 --> 886.67
because there's so many other types of

884.12 --> 889.22
scenarios that just look very similar to

886.67 --> 892.16
what we're dealing with in many

889.22 --> 894.71
different ways it's like the same

892.16 --> 904.79
painting with different times made by

894.71 --> 908.33
different painters it's kind of ironic

904.79 --> 910.31
considering all these poses the ancient

908.33 --> 912.59
depictions of earth it almost does look

910.31 --> 913.91
like the same painting painted by

912.59 --> 918.1
different painters so it's kind of

913.91 --> 918.1
ironic and I think about it

930.82 --> 936.649
gravity Oh God gotta get gotta get the

934.64 --> 940.399
gravity in that folklore it's so easy to

936.649 --> 943.1
burrow gravity into anything isn't it

940.399 --> 947.54
and that and they did it they really it

943.1 --> 950.87
tried to introduce gravity as a I guess

947.54 --> 953.18
a futurist based new modern folklore

950.87 --> 957.02
that would arrive because it's all based

953.18 --> 961.7199999999999
look the entire myth of gravity is all

957.02 --> 964.88
based on basic interactions and deriving

961.72 --> 969.62
mathematical approaches from that and it

964.88 --> 971.72
is so basic that even people that aren't

969.62 --> 974.18
it and yeah too smart

971.72 --> 976.7
with math can still kind of get that

974.18 --> 981.3499999999999
because it's so basic it's like the most

976.7 --> 983.63
basic thing it's but it's wrong now but

981.35 --> 986.9590000000001
because it's so basic it's so easy to

983.63 --> 989.39
end and grain within common speech

986.959 --> 991.6999999999999
culture it'll it'll start flowing itself

989.39 --> 994.58
and especially if you then put the word

991.7 --> 997.48
into cool contexts or funny contexts or

994.58 --> 1001.0
sounding smart context people will be

997.48 --> 1004.32
lured in by the the good appeal feel and

1001.0 --> 1006.64
then say yeah man every time that word

1004.32 --> 1008.98
intuitively every time you hear that

1006.64 --> 1010.93
word it is always a good feeling so if I

1008.98 --> 1012.16
use that word maybe that good feeling

1010.93 --> 1014.8
will rub off on me

1012.16 --> 1020.5889999999999
that's how it works that's how that's

1014.8 --> 1023.74
how they ingrained the word naturally it

1020.589 --> 1025.66
just put out a few speaking points give

1023.74 --> 1029.35
the the right coloring the right tone

1025.66 --> 1032.559
and people will start to perpetuate what

1029.35 --> 1033.9099999999999
is introduced themselves it's kind of

1032.559 --> 1037.569
the liberal system

1033.91 --> 1040.199
the original liberal system but it is it

1037.569 --> 1045.25
is prone to corruption as we've all

1040.199 --> 1048.76
experienced now last ten years in ten

1045.25 --> 1052.09
years or more well now it's different

1048.76 --> 1054.66
because before there were just it was

1052.09 --> 1057.28
considered okay the Liberals were just

1054.66 --> 1060.01
honest and good willing and there were

1057.28 --> 1062.03
some bad players omits but now yeah the

1060.01 --> 1064.94
the actual application

1062.03 --> 1067.22
of the liberal mechanisms are literally

1064.94 --> 1069.94
corrupted in their foundation so you can

1067.22 --> 1072.73
it's not the same scenario anymore

1069.94 --> 1076.64
there's no more pretense there's no more

1072.73 --> 1077.74
presupposition of a of a positive end

1076.64 --> 1081.8600000000001
result with it

1077.74 --> 1084.74
it's just delusion assuming that it will

1081.86 --> 1087.59
when all practical experience empirical

1084.74 --> 1094.7
data will show that it doesn't and it's

1087.59 --> 1098.1499999999999
actually detrimental so yeah migrated

1094.7 --> 1101.189
that the politics

1098.15 --> 1101.189
[Music]

1111.179 --> 1117.1190000000001
but yeah gravity I did it's also a

1114.989 --> 1121.469
reason why I love the word gravity so

1117.119 --> 1123.9289999999999
much I think it is probably because in

1121.469 --> 1131.539
my youth what encouraged me so much to

1123.929 --> 1135.5700000000002
get into English wash was English spoken

1131.539 --> 1140.279
cartoons in the early morning Saturday

1135.57 --> 1143.779
morning that but yeah it does that is

1140.279 --> 1148.08
the perfect target group for inserting

1143.779 --> 1150.509
the application of gravity in general

1148.08 --> 1153.33
culture to put that in there some way

1150.509 --> 1159.299
not necessarily to explain gravity but

1153.33 --> 1161.7289999999998
to just use that that word and and give

1159.299 --> 1164.6689999999999
it some weight give it some good feel

1161.729 --> 1167.46
for you to think that that is cool it's

1164.669 --> 1169.7990000000002
the best spot cartoons aimed at children

1167.46 --> 1172.739
now all the Saturday morning cartoons

1169.799 --> 1175.019
were really kind of dumbed down and I

1172.739 --> 1177.659
guess originally one would think yeah

1175.019 --> 1179.159
that's because it's like Maine aimed for

1177.659 --> 1182.5800000000002
really young children what doesn't

1179.159 --> 1185.5490000000002
doesn't seem to logical the really young

1182.58 --> 1188.7289999999998
children would probably not be that

1185.549 --> 1193.679
amused by that kind of stuff so the

1188.729 --> 1196.499
children that would get it they I don't

1193.679 --> 1200.519
know it does seem like it is

1196.499 --> 1203.749
unnecessarily dumbed down and we know

1200.519 --> 1205.889
now that children can very much adapt

1203.749 --> 1208.499
intellectually to material they are

1205.889 --> 1210.7389999999998
confronted with as a little child very

1208.499 --> 1210.739
easily

1214.379 --> 1220.6899999999998
but yeah that's what they did back then

1216.82 --> 1223.029
and I rolled into that as well probably

1220.69 --> 1225.8200000000002
rubbed off in a bad way as well but it

1223.029 --> 1228.999
did give me a lot of passion for English

1225.82 --> 1231.1589999999999
and also English just as an inspiration

1228.999 --> 1236.489
language so maybe in a way even these

1231.159 --> 1236.489
attempts a typical cultural manipulation

1237.059 --> 1244.47
that American culture is typically being

1240.369 --> 1251.049
subjected to kind of voluntarily almost

1244.47 --> 1255.1290000000001
that still appealed to me but yeah then

1251.049 --> 1257.739
later came aware that that it's

1255.129 --> 1261.369
different here it's more like there's

1257.739 --> 1264.46
the socialist and Marxist and communist

1261.369 --> 1267.22
thing going on the more east you go and

1264.46 --> 1270.729
we're in the middle of it and we're

1267.22 --> 1273.369
entangled with all and yet they do it

1270.729 --> 1279.779
too but they don't do it the same way

1273.369 --> 1279.779
they don't they don't bring joy with it

1280.679 --> 1287.5900000000001
that's what I have experienced so I yeah

1284.979 --> 1292.929
I don't know I don't know if any of this

1287.59 --> 1294.609
makes any sense to you probably does I

1292.929 --> 1296.669
just don't really know where to go with

1294.609 --> 1296.6689999999999
this

1323.63 --> 1327.74
okay see you guys are having a

1325.88 --> 1337.21
completely different conversation here

1327.74 --> 1340.46
oh okay I see flatter spaceman try to

1337.21 --> 1343.24
try to get his sister to Flat Earth he

1340.46 --> 1343.24
adds a tough one

1367.82 --> 1376.62
don't forget that siblings like

1372.26 --> 1378.51
spiritually and mentally because they

1376.62 --> 1381.27
grew up together and if they've spend a

1378.51 --> 1384.93
lot of time together and like special

1381.27 --> 1388.11
relationships they will grow up in a

1384.93 --> 1390.3300000000002
certain context and make them more

1388.11 --> 1392.82
resilient to change because they're like

1390.33 --> 1394.86
sparring partners spiritually and

1392.82 --> 1396.6299999999999
mentally naturally that's what siblings

1394.86 --> 1399.1399999999999
still like brothers or sisters brought

1396.63 --> 1401.3400000000001
as well as sister sister certain

1399.14 --> 1404.94
arrangement naturally certain energy

1401.34 --> 1411.11
setting depending on yeah what sex it is

1404.94 --> 1414.15
yeah it does matter and so your direct

1411.11 --> 1416.61
siblings what is it oh yeah your sister

1414.15 --> 1419.19
your brother those are the toughest

1416.61 --> 1422.6399999999999
because they are the most resilient

1419.19 --> 1424.68
naturally instinctively so to assume

1422.64 --> 1431.4
that you can just break it to them and

1424.68 --> 1434.43
they'll say oh wow no you what typically

1431.4 --> 1437.8200000000002
probably will happen is you either like

1434.43 --> 1440.88
give them to them a weapon against you

1437.82 --> 1443.55
like they will maybe comedic ly or

1440.88 --> 1445.8000000000002
whatever use that against you or they

1443.55 --> 1447.72
will literally be scared off by it and

1445.8 --> 1453.12
take distance in their heart yeah it

1447.72 --> 1456.63
happens because it's like nobody would

1453.12 --> 1461.2199999999998
do that it's because it's your brother

1456.63 --> 1463.8300000000002
yes it's it's difficult to explain like

1461.22 --> 1467.75
I'd never expect my brother to to go

1463.83 --> 1470.55
with Flat Earth but on the other hand I

1467.75 --> 1473.22
rather see it as just testing the water

1470.55 --> 1475.32
so I I just bring it up and not expect

1473.22 --> 1477.23
them to change and hey it might just

1475.32 --> 1480.3899999999999
turn out that at some point they just

1477.23 --> 1483.89
got into it themselves at their thoughts

1480.39 --> 1483.89
about it and

1485.1 --> 1493.4089999999999
yeah and who knows you don't necessarily

1489.24 --> 1495.509
have to like try to convert them at like

1493.409 --> 1501.45
this and edit that idea of literally

1495.509 --> 1505.13
trying to convert people it's I think

1501.45 --> 1508.23
it's not really I think it's like

1505.13 --> 1510.45
ideological I don't think it's real that

1508.23 --> 1515.07
you can really convince people but you

1510.45 --> 1517.97
can feed into their curiousness and you

1515.07 --> 1520.62
can to try to answer questions because

1517.97 --> 1523.23
that's what it's about like if they're

1520.62 --> 1524.4899999999998
if the other side doesn't have questions

1523.23 --> 1527.57
if they don't want to know there's

1524.49 --> 1527.57
really nothing you can do

1532.7 --> 1535.239
yeah

1537.65 --> 1545.8000000000002
Yeah right while James Mason that can

1542.57 --> 1545.8
definitely be tough as well

1561.67 --> 1566.96
yeah John of the house

1563.93 --> 1569.3
that's quite why why do you keep on

1566.96 --> 1573.3500000000001
asking that question or why do ballers

1569.3 --> 1574.76
keep on asking that question when is in

1573.35 --> 1579.29
hasn't that been answered

1574.76 --> 1581.89
time and again don't you know the answer

1579.29 --> 1586.3999999999999
to that question

1581.89 --> 1589.1000000000001
John uptown why don't you answer that

1586.4 --> 1591.3200000000002
question you know you can do it just

1589.1 --> 1594.8
take one of the thousands of responses

1591.32 --> 1597.35
from people in one way or the other try

1594.8 --> 1599.03
to take the more subtle ones and just

1597.35 --> 1604.8799999999999
play it off in your head and then type

1599.03 --> 1607.91
that down every time and I'm just saying

1604.88 --> 1614.69
hundreds of times people have said have

1607.91 --> 1617.0
given answer to that question it's a

1614.69 --> 1620.03
base subject that questions been asked

1617.0 --> 1623.51
since the beginning and it's been

1620.03 --> 1625.8999999999999
answered since the beginning and it's

1623.51 --> 1628.58
change and shift and independent and

1625.9 --> 1631.22
depends on kind of what's going down at

1628.58 --> 1634.6399999999999
that moment might shift a little but in

1631.22 --> 1636.3700000000001
general what it's about why it is

1634.64 --> 1639.26
important the shape of the earth well

1636.37 --> 1642.6799999999998
it's not even the literal shape but it

1639.26 --> 1645.35
is that we that there is a system to

1642.68 --> 1653.53
deceive us about it and that it's being

1645.35 --> 1657.23
being used against us and there's a big

1653.53 --> 1659.66
philosophical implications of of course

1657.23 --> 1662.99
also the nature of the realm the flat

1659.66 --> 1666.71
nature the impossibility of space the

1662.99 --> 1672.52
containment and the unknown factors of

1666.71 --> 1672.52
the actual size of the container

1677.02 --> 1686.2
these are all interesting things with

1684.1 --> 1689.559
wide implications as to and of course

1686.2 --> 1693.73
the inevitable nature of creation all of

1689.559 --> 1695.32
that literally ties in to that so that's

1693.73 --> 1698.6200000000001
why it matters it matters a lot it is

1695.32 --> 1701.6789999999999
it's a a part it's just a part but it is

1698.62 --> 1705.4289999999999
a a critical cornerstone part I say in

1701.679 --> 1707.26
the hourglass it's pretty much the

1705.429 --> 1711.0700000000002
middle part the middle piece that's

1707.26 --> 1715.809
unavoidable because so much rests on it

1711.07 --> 1718.51
on either side against it or for it it

1715.809 --> 1720.97
it is the reversed world it is the real

1718.51 --> 1724.0
world and the reversed world opposing it

1720.97 --> 1729.07
and Flat Earth is pretty much at the

1724.0 --> 1731.07
core that that centre of that all so you

1729.07 --> 1736.05
could say it is at the tip of the spear

1731.07 --> 1736.05
or at the crossroads

1742.74 --> 1748.6200000000001
then it cannot be any other place also

1749.49 --> 1755.44
because just my spiritual mechanically

1752.44 --> 1760.21
and knowledge mechanically and conscious

1755.44 --> 1762.94
mechanically it is at the dead center so

1760.21 --> 1766.8700000000001
much brings directly froth from that

1762.94 --> 1770.26
specific realization or from the

1766.87 --> 1773.07
cover-up of it so many options were

1770.26 --> 1775.57
opened when that was concealed even

1773.07 --> 1777.58
though it originally it must have seen

1775.57 --> 1780.9099999999999
it completely impossible because of the

1777.58 --> 1783.34
natural drawn conclusions from being

1780.91 --> 1787.0900000000001
used to not having a deception about the

1783.34 --> 1789.1899999999998
shape of the earth that would more

1787.09 --> 1791.05
naturally contradict the globe

1789.19 --> 1794.5900000000001
machinations from an instinctive

1791.05 --> 1796.75
perspective but because yeah all of

1794.59 --> 1799.8899999999999
those natural instincts were taken away

1796.75 --> 1802.66
when the globe was forced upon society

1799.89 --> 1804.91
because it was forced at first for

1802.66 --> 1809.22
schools and then also through government

1804.91 --> 1812.92
I'm pretty sure and media added in and

1809.22 --> 1817.27
so with that in doctrine ation comes the

1812.92 --> 1821.14
loss of the natural forming instincts

1817.27 --> 1823.24
and inside structures based upon the

1821.14 --> 1826.18
knowledge of the Flat Earth and what

1823.24 --> 1828.43
comes with that there's a loss in that

1826.18 --> 1831.6100000000001
and so people come become even more

1828.43 --> 1835.0
viable to more machinations based upon

1831.61 --> 1837.28
that cornerstone that that core peace

1835.0 --> 1841.14
the realization of the geometrical

1837.28 --> 1841.1399999999999
nature of our earth and the realm

1846.99 --> 1851.299
see it is at the car

1854.1 --> 1861.78
there's so much at the cord so much

1856.81 --> 1868.26
under pressure that even among ourselves

1861.78 --> 1876.19
like ideological attempts tend to get in

1868.26 --> 1878.74
like self-censorship yeah even people

1876.19 --> 1880.3
flat-earthers sake we're not gonna call

1878.74 --> 1882.58
it flat earthers because it's too

1880.3 --> 1886.03
controversial well why do you think that

1882.58 --> 1888.25
is because it is at the dead center it

1886.03 --> 1896.26
is at the energy web center of the

1888.25 --> 1899.02
entire system so they'll naturally

1896.26 --> 1903.1
they'll be more desperate to take on any

1899.02 --> 1905.02
kind of ability to relieve some of the

1903.1 --> 1906.58
tension that they're being subjected to

1905.02 --> 1909.52
because I think people highly

1906.58 --> 1913.33
underestimate just the tension you get

1909.52 --> 1915.57
subjected to by literally just assuming

1913.33 --> 1917.9399999999998
flatters talking about it and not being

1915.57 --> 1922.11
[Music]

1917.94 --> 1925.99
not being dissuaded being just opening

1922.11 --> 1928.8899999999999
with that because it drives a lot of

1925.99 --> 1928.89
people just nuts

1932.5 --> 1941.73
in a very irrational way it seems it

1936.04 --> 1949.51
seems kind of unnatural from a more

1941.73 --> 1952.0
short-short looking perspective so yeah

1949.51 --> 1953.68
so a lot flat earthers may even start to

1952.0 --> 1955.54
say okay well just not call it Flat

1953.68 --> 1958.9
Earth anymore but please just tell them

1955.54 --> 1962.04
down the pressure some way or give us

1958.9 --> 1968.3200000000002
some more room on the media system that

1962.04 --> 1972.46
actually it rests on the ball that all

1968.32 --> 1977.35
of that instead of returning to a pure

1972.46 --> 1982.51
esoterism which is the the the core

1977.35 --> 1984.99
approach it's the path of Christ set to

1982.51 --> 1984.99
the center

1992.5 --> 1995.68
[Music]

2038.62 --> 2047.6599999999999
[Music]

2060.56 --> 2063.159
me

2076.409 --> 2081.619
Wow

2078.53 --> 2085.3590000000004
seems by the way that it's minor

2081.619 --> 2089.71
ilmin I hope nobody even noticed that

2085.359 --> 2092.45
it's been around for like half a year

2089.71 --> 2094.28
it's like insanely long and it's like

2092.45 --> 2096.6189999999997
literally like a curse didn't make any

2094.28 --> 2101.8390000000004
sense but it's going away

2096.619 --> 2104.17
don't took half a year sheesh it's about

2101.839 --> 2104.17
time

2154.25 --> 2163.2
all right well you know bait 60 RMC I

2159.93 --> 2165.45
get the feeling I'm hearing information

2163.2 --> 2167.64
from other people do more digging

2165.45 --> 2171.24
research as always appreciate that

2167.64 --> 2173.8799999999997
because and when I get the feeling about

2171.24 --> 2179.43
Elon Musk is he's not as much a troll he

2173.88 --> 2182.4
is literally like a mercenary or private

2179.43 --> 2184.14
version of NASA so he's literally doing

2182.4 --> 2185.849
the same thing he is a spin doctor

2184.14 --> 2189.0299999999997
factory but he's like a private

2185.849 --> 2191.01
operation and he's being hired by the

2189.03 --> 2193.8
government and I don't know if the

2191.01 --> 2196.0200000000004
government is satisfied with what he

2193.8 --> 2202.1090000000004
does he does keep on getting that

2196.02 --> 2204.95
funding so but it Elon Musk's doesn't

2202.109 --> 2208.17
seem more stupid than what NASA does

2204.95 --> 2210.5
seems kind of at the same level don't

2208.17 --> 2210.5
you think

2213.859 --> 2219.24
even though yeah like the fumbles are

2217.23 --> 2222.66
that's unusual

2219.24 --> 2224.7299999999996
although NASA does fumble on camera as

2222.66 --> 2226.6499999999996
well but yeah even musk like fumbles

2224.73 --> 2229.26
with his own freakin product that that

2226.65 --> 2233.329
is kind of unheard of but then again

2229.26 --> 2233.329
NASA doesn't really sell products

2238.73 --> 2245.37
they may advertise for products but it's

2242.28 --> 2248.4900000000002
and that's yeah they don't I don't think

2245.37 --> 2253.3199999999997
NASA literally has like a company store

2248.49 --> 2255.2999999999997
thing or whatever I don't know how it

2253.32 --> 2259.25
works NASA's big probably I don't know

2255.3 --> 2259.25
what what everything is attached to it

2259.82 --> 2262.9390000000003
[Music]

2308.5 --> 2312.5
[Music]

2321.72 --> 2324.95
that really

2326.21 --> 2329.389
[Music]

2332.24 --> 2335.5
yeah that's pretty bizarre

2351.3 --> 2359.1600000000003
it's just odd I guess that in some way

2355.02 --> 2363.49
having the whole space and heliocentrism

2359.16 --> 2365.89
they just insisted the controller seemed

2363.49 --> 2369.3599999999997
to insist that be a part of Western

2365.89 --> 2372.8399999999997
society somehow because they keep on

2369.36 --> 2372.84
spreading that out

2441.73 --> 2452.41
I have no idea join up now Jordan well

2449.98 --> 2454.93
there's probably a couple of kids

2452.41 --> 2458.8489999999997
that'll be very very inspired or

2454.93 --> 2466.5989999999997
obsessed with it for us for a period you

2458.849 --> 2470.4100000000003
know but like continually I don't think

2466.599 --> 2474.19
so I don't think that any it's like yeah

2470.41 --> 2477.7
nobody's thinking about Santa Claus like

2474.19 --> 2481.859
every day of the year you know but at

2477.7 --> 2481.859
some point they people do think about it

2491.88 --> 2500.2200000000003
right yeah they do get inspired by

2494.19 --> 2503.76
Cowboys I know yeah but hey astronauts

2500.22 --> 2507.9599999999996
are definitely also in there and weirdly

2503.76 --> 2510.9
enough just as a self-standing concept I

2507.96 --> 2514.4900000000002
do kind of get the appeal it's the

2510.9 --> 2518.2200000000003
adventure in this dinosaur real a

2514.49 --> 2520.29
natural environment I find that very

2518.22 --> 2524.6699999999996
fascinating and I find it interesting

2520.29 --> 2534.66
and it is just like deep-sea diving but

2524.67 --> 2536.82
different in a way it's kind of the

2534.66 --> 2540.72
exact opposite instead of having more

2536.82 --> 2544.5
pressure you have super much less

2540.72 --> 2546.54
pressure yeah what is it so it is kind

2544.5 --> 2551.01
of like the outer space vacuum in a way

2546.54 --> 2556.92
is a reversed environment world of the

2551.01 --> 2560.82
ocean it is travel through like every

2556.92 --> 2565.28
sorry relation with space will always

2560.82 --> 2567.3900000000003
reflect eventually on things like

2565.28 --> 2569.6400000000003
colonization and the Renaissance and

2567.39 --> 2574.98
going out with ships on stories made

2569.64 --> 2579.72
with that because those are the the

2574.98 --> 2583.16
original experiences to reflect upon to

2579.72 --> 2586.68
give it a real feeling of being real so

2583.16 --> 2589.3199999999997
in a way outer space as the storytelling

2586.68 --> 2593.54
medium is the reverse of the reversed

2589.32 --> 2593.54
world version of the ocean

2596.77 --> 2605.28
hmm hey Randy morning afternoon I mean

2606.27 --> 2619.57
yeah yeah yeah Bates RMC I know we're

2611.83 --> 2621.8199999999997
talking about the fictional realm I know

2619.57 --> 2624.54
it's a lot to presuppose but that's why

2621.82 --> 2624.54
it's fiction you know

2642.54 --> 2646.16
a can be too

2647.17 --> 2654.85
ah just reminded me yeah you linked me

2653.17 --> 2660.7000000000003
up with the stream yesterday but I

2654.85 --> 2662.29
completely missed out on it it was too

2660.7 --> 2666.46
long a wait and then I got distracted

2662.29 --> 2669.13
and forgot about it was it any good

2666.46 --> 2676.54
is it still somewhere on YouTube so I

2669.13 --> 2678.7000000000003
can watch it back no it's no gunshots

2676.54 --> 2683.32
it's all fireworks you know this is the

2678.7 --> 2688.54
Netherland so pretty much the last five

2683.32 --> 2692.31
days and two days after after the new

2688.54 --> 2695.7599999999998
year like there's just people like

2692.31 --> 2703.89
lighting off fireworks constantly

2695.76 --> 2703.8900000000003
especially kids oh wait

2706.5 --> 2709.88
it's in five days

2712.6 --> 2717.8399999999997
okay so it wasn't in five hours in one

2715.12 --> 2717.8399999999997
in five days

2724.45 --> 2735.41
it's just kids goofing around with

2727.13 --> 2740.7200000000003
fireworks come on guys remember my new

2735.41 --> 2742.73
year's video right well there's a lot of

2740.72 --> 2747.8599999999997
fireworks going off in the Netherlands

2742.73 --> 2754.46
it's like we are especially fanatical

2747.86 --> 2758.15
about it I guess yeah kids with

2754.46 --> 2760.76
fireworks it is the worst idea ever but

2758.15 --> 2763.9100000000003
it kind of works like the amount of

2760.76 --> 2768.2000000000003
accidents that happen our are still

2763.91 --> 2772.12
really minimum but yeah just don't get

2768.2 --> 2772.12
fireworks or the little kids you know

2772.45 --> 2775.75
don't do it

2780.329 --> 2785.44
like not without making sure that they

2783.76 --> 2787.63
get the feel for it and know what

2785.44 --> 2790.7400000000002
they're doing and know how to avoid the

2787.63 --> 2790.7400000000002
the bigger risks

2791.67 --> 2796.299
don't get all overconfident in that

2794.26 --> 2803.4900000000002
nonsense because that typically leads to

2796.299 --> 2803.49
accidents okay it's not funny

2810.63 --> 2821.069
yeah the Netherlands is hilarious the

2819.45 --> 2823.8289999999997
fireworks have always been like that

2821.069 --> 2827.819
here it's like I guess we were firing

2823.829 --> 2830.099
firework enthusiasts and they I'm not

2827.819 --> 2833.22
complaining I loved fireworks as a kid a

2830.099 --> 2836.789
lot I got so I got obsessed with it that

2833.22 --> 2839.7
I even partially learned Commodore basic

2836.789 --> 2845.9700000000003
programming in order to make ASCII

2839.7 --> 2848.519
animations of my of my list of what I

2845.97 --> 2850.4399999999996
wanted to by next year in matter of

2848.519 --> 2852.8689999999997
fireworks and I would like make it six

2850.44 --> 2859.68
months ahead a sketch like I really

2852.869 --> 2863.239
freakin love fireworks as little kid got

2859.68 --> 2863.239
a bit obsessed about it sometimes

2888.91 --> 2891.7799999999997
mm-hmm

2892.14 --> 2901.3799999999997
oh yeah oh it's it's thankfully enough

2899.34 --> 2903.96
there is still like plenty of police

2901.38 --> 2908.1600000000003
going around and if people are if kids

2903.96 --> 2913.44
start to get all destructive or [ __ ]

2908.16 --> 2916.92
with fireworks then it's not like there

2913.44 --> 2918.9
it's it's full mayhem out there like

2916.92 --> 2921.36
kids know kind of they're goofing around

2918.9 --> 2922.4700000000003
there they're being on the edge but that

2921.36 --> 2924.1800000000003
that's just normal

2922.47 --> 2926.43
that's what kids do but they're not

2924.18 --> 2928.1699999999996
literally trying to just smash things or

2926.43 --> 2933.18
I think they're suddenly like some kind

2928.17 --> 2937.41
of terrorists or whatever that can do

2933.18 --> 2939.0299999999997
anything no because I think the police

2937.41 --> 2945.3199999999997
does definitely take care of that

2939.03 --> 2945.32
quickly to get that out of the way

2947.27 --> 2953.46
although yeah eventually in the new

2950.55 --> 2957.9
years a typical thing that I see is that

2953.46 --> 2960.9
a public trash cans do typically tend to

2957.9 --> 2962.9700000000003
get blown up but in the center city they

2960.9 --> 2966.03
have like a countermeasure they they

2962.97 --> 2967.98
close them up but yeah that's in the

2966.03 --> 2969.6000000000004
center in the more outskirts there's

2967.98 --> 2972.18
still some of these trash cans around

2969.6 --> 2973.94
and they typically not all of them every

2972.18 --> 2979.41
time but they typically get blown up

2973.94 --> 2988.4900000000002
damaged they always find something too

2979.41 --> 2988.49
so traffic signs are also favorite

3014.75 --> 3021.2
oh yeah go good servant I haven't really

3017.75 --> 3025.369
talked to John in in a week now I think

3021.2 --> 3031.22
so I usually only get to talk to him

3025.369 --> 3033.23
through the Flat Earth debates and he's

3031.22 --> 3035.7099999999996
hadn't had a live ball busters for a

3033.23 --> 3035.71
while now

3047.35 --> 3054.3399999999997
right yeah good servant yeah I I

3050.94 --> 3056.68
appreciate that you'd say I'm getting a

3054.34 --> 3058.78
bigger voice well I'm just having my own

3056.68 --> 3062.29
development and there's I got other

3058.78 --> 3064.0
people like in a way there's there's

3062.29 --> 3067.81
trouble about because everybody that

3064.0 --> 3070.51
does that they do tend to like get a

3067.81 --> 3072.69
little bit more defensive in in the new

3070.51 --> 3074.7400000000002
things that it's it's like almost like

3072.69 --> 3077.14
gold-digging and when you really find

3074.74 --> 3079.8399999999997
the Suites yeah you find new grounds

3077.14 --> 3083.14
that are for before being closed off you

3079.84 --> 3085.54
get a bit like more aggressive maybe

3083.14 --> 3087.31
more defensive I have it in my own way

3085.54 --> 3089.11
as well but I've been dealing with that

3087.31 --> 3091.39
from start pretty much because I've

3089.11 --> 3094.96
always been trying to afford pretty far

3091.39 --> 3097.87
things and asian' is doing is

3094.96 --> 3100.75
exploration with with transmutation now

3097.87 --> 3103.99
is very heavy that the impact the result

3100.75 --> 3106.69
the consequence is just it's it's tough

3103.99 --> 3110.83
to really oversee and so it brings a lot

3106.69 --> 3115.4500000000003
of hassle with it and friction and new

3110.83 --> 3118.21
dilemmas people saying even polarization

3115.45 --> 3120.52
concerning chemistry because yeah

3118.21 --> 3122.65
because of this there's just gonna be

3120.52 --> 3128.0099999999998
people say oh oh chemistry it's all fake

3122.65 --> 3128.01
it's all nose nothing like there but or

3128.43 --> 3137.02
people that are gonna say know it that's

3131.29 --> 3139.84
just wrong or just no way like there's

3137.02 --> 3141.52
another explanation or if you just look

3139.84 --> 3143.4700000000003
into quantum mechanics blah blah blah

3141.52 --> 3147.79
decide study that's actually kind of

3143.47 --> 3150.22
pseudo scientist eventually so that's

3147.79 --> 3153.46
the problem that polarization will

3150.22 --> 3155.1099999999997
arrive and Asian is already in these

3153.46 --> 3157.48
tendencies because that's where he's

3155.11 --> 3160.03
going in that they're in that area and

3157.48 --> 3161.95
I've tried to reach out for him a show

3160.03 --> 3165.34
like wait wait there's still the middle

3161.95 --> 3167.1099999999997
ground and he would almost immediately

3165.34 --> 3169.6000000000004
start slapping me like who are you doing

3167.11 --> 3171.82
this reading that because he's expecting

3169.6 --> 3173.29
a polarized response because that is the

3171.82 --> 3174.76
first thing that tends to happen when

3173.29 --> 3176.29
you go that just like when you first

3174.76 --> 3177.82
enter flattered at the polarized

3176.29 --> 3179.22
response the first thing you should be

3177.82 --> 3181.4300000000003
expecting

3179.22 --> 3184.7099999999996
deepers and it's another layer

3181.43 --> 3187.6189999999997
programming in a way of fixing the

3184.71 --> 3189.9
programming of fine chiseling leaving

3187.619 --> 3192.81
details out uniforming it with the

3189.9 --> 3194.55
bigger plan and the Asian is going there

3192.81 --> 3197.52
and I'm I'm going there with him and

3194.55 --> 3199.5
that helps a lot and the quantum

3197.52 --> 3202.349
mechanics issues comes right next to it

3199.5 --> 3213.3
it's probably part in the chain of as to

3202.349 --> 3215.4300000000003
how they did that and I'm very glad that

3213.3 --> 3219.3300000000004
he's there because he's one of the few

3215.43 --> 3222.14
guys that is not just talking the talk

3219.33 --> 3225.33
or knowing the knowledge but is actually

3222.14 --> 3227.9
doing it is actually going there

3225.33 --> 3230.609
mentally and now he's a very effective

3227.9 --> 3235.77
researcher he knows has his good sources

3230.609 --> 3239.19
and in and I'm not as good as that but I

3235.77 --> 3241.619
have a lot of sensibility fine-tune I

3239.19 --> 3246.869
fine-tuned my sensories my ethereal

3241.619 --> 3250.38
senses my my esoteric senses to a great

3246.869 --> 3253.71
degree and a further than him but he as

3250.38 --> 3256.08
so we're kind of like a good team at it

3253.71 --> 3258.26
together if we can synchronize properly

3256.08 --> 3263.0699999999997
and we know that we even discuss this

3258.26 --> 3268.349
because vision is extremely smart it

3263.07 --> 3270.3900000000003
really is not perfect though then every

3268.349 --> 3276.349
super smart person can make very dumb

3270.39 --> 3276.3489999999997
mistakes and they will I do

3283.28 --> 3288.02
[Music]

3284.65 --> 3290.96
but yeah it's it's very promising I

3288.02 --> 3294.77
think that we can go forward there may

3290.96 --> 3297.68
even be some hope for an um although yes

3294.77 --> 3301.34
Anand definitely dove into that Sivan

3297.68 --> 3306.56
yep it versus he let himself get super

3301.34 --> 3311.1200000000003
polarized against QE and it's yeah

3306.56 --> 3313.97
that's draining his potential away from

3311.12 --> 3316.04
what he can do so I hope you'll just

3313.97 --> 3320.8399999999997
stop doing that stop being a Sivan yet

3316.04 --> 3322.64
to QE and kind of let it all cool down

3320.84 --> 3326.09
and see what's there to work with

3322.64 --> 3329.54
because I think that Anan might be

3326.09 --> 3335.0
smarter than and he's looked then he's

3329.54 --> 3336.59
acted I dunno about and on that he does

3335.0 --> 3341.42
seem to have this like insatiable

3336.59 --> 3343.57
curiosity spirit and he's definitely

3341.42 --> 3348.83
very strong at that if we can just

3343.57 --> 3351.26
control control his is ego alongside

3348.83 --> 3353.84
that and not let himself get polarized

3351.26 --> 3356.1400000000003
so easily then then we got something to

3353.84 --> 3356.1400000000003
work with

3359.41 --> 3363.85
right yeah Nathan Oakley

3364.65 --> 3367.849
[Music]

3370.88 --> 3376.8900000000003
but at least he is willing to yeast has

3374.28 --> 3380.7900000000004
the curiosity and it kind of pushes him

3376.89 --> 3382.68
to keep on finding that border and see

3380.79 --> 3385.71
if he can widen find a way through and

3382.68 --> 3388.14
if you're then not letting yourself get

3385.71 --> 3392.01
polarized you won't get stuck and if you

3388.14 --> 3396.5099999999998
stay pure and keep on going the path of

3392.01 --> 3400.0800000000004
purity then eventually you'll get where

3396.51 --> 3406.28
dejeuner me are going you will be able

3400.08 --> 3411.95
to come with us and yeah work on this

3406.28 --> 3414.5400000000004
see if we can find a sensible replace

3411.95 --> 3419.22
structure it's almost like spiritual

3414.54 --> 3420.84
surgery in the body of knowledge like we

3419.22 --> 3422.7
know there's something wrong here

3420.84 --> 3426.03
there's things incomplete so this it's

3422.7 --> 3429.81
like a slight damage or inflammation how

3426.03 --> 3431.9100000000003
do you replace that how do you make sure

3429.81 --> 3436.2599999999998
that not everything just completely

3431.91 --> 3439.47
crumbles but that you can fit something

3436.26 --> 3442.32
in it that'll fix it and give it like

3439.47 --> 3444.83
room for growth so everything that's

3442.32 --> 3449.13
really there can manifest on top of it

3444.83 --> 3451.68
that's how it feels if you replace it

3449.13 --> 3454.92
then don't destroy it don't just destroy

3451.68 --> 3459.2
everything replace it so that what is

3454.92 --> 3462.9900000000002
missing you can find a way to grow

3459.2 --> 3466.08
getaway like carefully surgically remove

3462.99 --> 3471.1189999999997
the thing that is obstruction the

3466.08 --> 3473.869
natural growth of what is there in the

3471.119 --> 3473.869
body of knowledge

3474.68 --> 3478.999
it sounds kind of like wizardry doesn't

3476.93 --> 3481.97
it but it's we do it

3478.999 --> 3485.2099999999996
I do it in the name of of the light the

3481.97 --> 3500.569
act the actual light that not the dark

3485.21 --> 3503.529
light truth and I try to guide myself by

3500.569 --> 3503.529
love as I do it

3518.96 --> 3527.61
well a rockier life it's not necessarily

3523.29 --> 3529.89
true though if you're not being

3527.61 --> 3532.83
challenged doesn't mean you're not

3529.89 --> 3535.16
truthful it can also mean that literally

3532.83 --> 3538.38
nobody understands what you're saying

3535.16 --> 3540.06
because I had that like in the beginning

3538.38 --> 3543.4500000000003
are you kidding me

3540.06 --> 3547.88
when I showed my very first youtube apis

3543.45 --> 3551.22
ode it was kind of spread around what

3547.88 --> 3557.46
people just said yeah it was nicest but

3551.22 --> 3560.0299999999997
I people didn't really know there were

3557.46 --> 3562.77
just things about it that they just

3560.03 --> 3565.26
didn't know what to think about it like

3562.77 --> 3567.84
the the looping concept it just put like

3565.26 --> 3570.03
what I don't understand what you mean

3567.84 --> 3573.03
and even at the start like the

3570.03 --> 3576.21
holographic Sun people are like what

3573.03 --> 3578.07
that sounds very sci-fi ish or something

3576.21 --> 3580.68
but they just don't understand and if

3578.07 --> 3583.44
you don't understand it doesn't mean

3580.68 --> 3585.3599999999997
that your automatic owed them go like

3583.44 --> 3587.58
typical baller or savonius they look

3585.36 --> 3593.06
these crews these crazies dumb or that

3587.58 --> 3593.06
did happen but people were not just

3594.65 --> 3601.53
always it doesn't always mean that if

3598.29 --> 3603.93
you have can simply mean that the trolls

3601.53 --> 3606.3500000000004
haven't found you or that nobody gets

3603.93 --> 3606.35
you yet

3612.61 --> 3616.4500000000003
all right sir check oh okay yeah you

3614.92 --> 3618.58
asked that question yesterday it's only

3616.45 --> 3621.04
fair now that I bring up the looping

3618.58 --> 3624.31
model that you addressed that

3621.04 --> 3628.36
that's very tactically put well done sir

3624.31 --> 3634.14
check out all right well I don't know

3628.36 --> 3639.25
the nature of to what aspects the Earth

3634.14 --> 3641.3199999999997
may be looping because there's going to

3639.25 --> 3643.75
at least if there is any kind of look

3641.32 --> 3647.17
there's going to be a loop in two

3643.75 --> 3650.14
directions and that's East the West in

3647.17 --> 3654.55
some way maybe an incomplete arc but the

3650.14 --> 3659.44
loops gonna be in a sense is the West if

3654.55 --> 3661.78
it is looping if it's not a disc but yet

3659.44 --> 3664.54
I don't know about the other loops there

3661.78 --> 3666.9700000000003
could be a loop north to south at some

3664.54 --> 3669.58
point we don't know if ever it could

3666.97 --> 3673.6299999999997
also be a barrier and the same kind of

3669.58 --> 3674.98
goes for up and down I don't know it

3673.63 --> 3678.4300000000003
could be simply there's a cut-off

3674.98 --> 3681.16
there's no more volume for matter to

3678.43 --> 3685.0899999999997
expand into it just is cut off it's just

3681.16 --> 3687.2799999999997
the volumetric limit to the container or

3685.09 --> 3689.1400000000003
there could be some kind of knife it's

3687.28 --> 3690.94
probably more like that there may be

3689.14 --> 3693.1
physical barrier that's going to be cut

3690.94 --> 3701.38
in between eventually it's gonna be a

3693.1 --> 3704.41
volumetric end of the space and as for

3701.38 --> 3707.1400000000003
down oh it could be kind of the same

3704.41 --> 3709.42
I've proposed that if there is a loop up

3707.14 --> 3715.6
to down then we'd literally be looking

3709.42 --> 3717.91
at our own ceiling that the firmament

3715.6 --> 3720.2799999999997
may be the very bottom of the earth and

3717.91 --> 3726.37
I don't know how deep that is I have

3720.28 --> 3729.4
absolutely no idea could be like 300

3726.37 --> 3732.94
miles or something could be a thousand

3729.4 --> 3735.94
miles could be a hundred thousand miles

3732.94 --> 3738.52
it sounds crazy right I don't know how I

3735.94 --> 3742.27
have no idea it's probably not a hundred

3738.52 --> 3745.36
thousand miles though but we don't know

3742.27 --> 3746.319
we don't know if there's other layers

3745.36 --> 3750.6690000000003
maybe

3746.319 --> 3752.439
this realm has downwards and who knows

3750.669 --> 3755.89
upwards who knows what we're gonna find

3752.439 --> 3758.41
if we ever can reach that top maybe it

3755.89 --> 3760.779
is like a giant stack of levels and

3758.41 --> 3765.069
there's like 10 levels above us 10

3760.779 --> 3767.319
levels below us I I drew that in the

3765.069 --> 3770.65
original drawing of my very first

3767.319 --> 3772.779
episode it could be and you don't know

3770.65 --> 3775.2690000000002
if you can fit there might be a way to

3772.779 --> 3777.789
physically get there yeah exploration of

3775.269 --> 3780.279
all the levels yeah really plays into

3777.789 --> 3781.989
what we typically want to do now doesn't

3780.279 --> 3784.689
it it's very inspiring to think that

3781.989 --> 3788.489
it's absolutely no guarantee whatsoever

3784.689 --> 3792.219
that there is anything above or below us

3788.489 --> 3796.299
at some point though or below us other

3792.219 --> 3803.429
than just more rock but there could be

3796.299 --> 3804.699
there is at least legend of a sub realm

3803.429 --> 3808.2090000000003
yeah

3804.699 --> 3811.39
widely spread what's it called again the

3808.209 --> 3815.1989999999996
the the Inner Earth so there could be a

3811.39 --> 3817.8689999999997
lot our layer below us and who knows how

3815.199 --> 3819.64
deep that is what it's like there's

3817.869 --> 3822.13
probably stories about it I've heard Jay

3819.64 --> 3826.4089999999997
dreamers talk about that concept a lot

3822.13 --> 3830.0190000000002
and the Jay dreamers it's very much a

3826.409 --> 3831.88
layered realm enthusiast and I totally

3830.019 --> 3833.799
agree Rhett I just said yeah there's so

3831.88 --> 3835.989
much it typically plays it to what we

3833.799 --> 3837.969
like exploring the levels it's

3835.989 --> 3840.13
fascinating it's inspiring so yeah of

3837.969 --> 3844.7490000000003
course he would take that as he does

3840.13 --> 3848.7690000000002
love fantasy aspect and it's not shying

3844.749 --> 3852.0589999999997
away from that it's this choice and it

3848.769 --> 3856.14
comes with a lot of beautiful things

3852.059 --> 3856.1400000000003
beautiful stories and ideas

3857.51 --> 3863.84
but yeah I hope that kind of answers the

3860.49 --> 3863.8399999999997
question is your checker

3870.03 --> 3876.38
all right well search echo you know say

3873.96 --> 3880.65
something idiotic would happen and

3876.38 --> 3883.92
whatever there's going to be a hole the

3880.65 --> 3886.23
bottom if you could survive there

3883.92 --> 3888.1800000000003
because there's probably gonna be a lot

3886.23 --> 3890.79
of pressure there I think I'm not a

3888.18 --> 3892.71
hundred percent sure depends on what it

3890.79 --> 3895.98
is and who knows but I think if there's

3892.71 --> 3899.58
an absolute bottom and it's gonna be the

3895.98 --> 3901.92
volumetric end as to where space is I

3899.58 --> 3905.37
think I could describe it to you what it

3901.92 --> 3907.71
is I don't know it could be slightly

3905.37 --> 3909.66
flexible or non flexible could be

3907.71 --> 3917.82
perfectly rigid but it's just gonna be

3909.66 --> 3922.2
like a a perfect mirror or glass surface

3917.82 --> 3925.3500000000004
of black and above relating with the

3922.2 --> 3927.8999999999996
daylight cycle it would then just change

3925.35 --> 3930.6
color with the daylight but under us

3927.9 --> 3932.7000000000003
it's always going to be black so it's

3930.6 --> 3935.46
always just gonna be this black thing I

3932.7 --> 3937.1
don't know maybe you can literally just

3935.46 --> 3942.7200000000003
walk on it like it's a stone or glass

3937.1 --> 3947.43
floor or it's it might be some with some

3942.72 --> 3948.2099999999996
weird way flexible slightly it's just

3947.43 --> 3952.71
going to be black

3948.21 --> 3955.05
that's pretty damn certain if in in the

3952.71 --> 3956.9700000000003
entire existence of the realm however

3955.05 --> 3958.3100000000004
long it takes if that ever happens that

3956.97 --> 3961.97
is gonna be what its gonna be like

3958.31 --> 3961.97
that's what I predict

3968.32 --> 3974.77
now I'm talking purely about the

3970.55 --> 3974.77
physical aspect okay I don't know

3976.72 --> 3981.95
because I don't think there is a

3978.71 --> 3985.67
physical place like hell although there

3981.95 --> 3989.75
may be frequency effects that you might

3985.67 --> 3993.44
be subjected to when you literally go

3989.75 --> 3996.32
down when you physically go down because

3993.44 --> 3998.7200000000003
hey we know we're kind of being a JEP is

3996.32 --> 3999.7400000000002
subjected to energy fields right from

3998.72 --> 4004.2999999999997
the ether and all that

3999.74 --> 4006.3999999999996
well we already can see and measure that

4004.3 --> 4010.9900000000002
tensions are different at different

4006.4 --> 4013.78
heights so there's a design effect with

4010.99 --> 4015.7599999999998
Heights and orientations humid so who

4013.78 --> 4018.88
knows what the ether energy or whatever

4015.76 --> 4021.55
forces we are subjected to that we don't

4018.88 --> 4024.19
even see or don't know about yet what

4021.55 --> 4026.5
they're like really super at the bottom

4024.19 --> 4028.33
we don't know what it would be like as

4026.5 --> 4031.42
an experience to actually be there it

4028.33 --> 4033.79
might be unattainable might be

4031.42 --> 4036.33
psychologically unattainable that you

4033.79 --> 4040.12
would just get too stressed out for some

4036.33 --> 4042.43
mysterious reason or ethereal reason if

4040.12 --> 4045.31
you just go down deep and maybe that is

4042.43 --> 4048.1
where some legend of Hell being down

4045.31 --> 4049.57
comes from who knows this is pure

4048.1 --> 4051.58
speculation by the way don't take

4049.57 --> 4056.4700000000003
anything what I'm saying here is

4051.58 --> 4060.39
absolute don't know if there is but

4056.47 --> 4065.5299999999997
there could be so much we don't know

4060.39 --> 4067.0899999999997
about the realm when you presuppose

4065.53 --> 4068.9500000000003
things there's all kinds of directions

4067.09 --> 4070.9300000000003
you could go but there should be all

4068.95 --> 4073.6299999999997
kinds of things you should be taking

4070.93 --> 4075.81
into account for potentially bumping

4073.63 --> 4075.81
into

4077.89 --> 4091.5699999999997
Oh George opto let me answer that for

4089.47 --> 4093.24
you and don't don't don't go back and

4091.57 --> 4096.28
forth like that

4093.24 --> 4098.11
my dad please just filler yeah all right

4096.28 --> 4100.78
what what gives the sensation that we

4098.11 --> 4104.53
call sunburn I can tell you that it's

4100.78 --> 4107.95
daylight being absorbed by your skin and

4104.53 --> 4110.86
then transforming it in a certain way

4107.95 --> 4112.63
that's detrimental to your cellular

4110.86 --> 4114.91
structure because it's too much

4112.63 --> 4124.42
it's the daylight being absorbed by your

4114.91 --> 4126.19
skin that's causes sunburn that's where

4124.42 --> 4128.89
it happens it doesn't happen that it

4126.19 --> 4131.049999999999
happens here that's where you measure it

4128.89 --> 4136.02
that's where the interaction is that's

4131.05 --> 4136.02
your proof your empirical proof

4149.449 --> 4153.759
right that you're welcome to check off

4161.119 --> 4168.089999999999
hmm

4163.8 --> 4171.87
no I'm already talking for over an hour

4168.09 --> 4171.87
how time has flown

4188.449 --> 4197.33
yeah yeah you can janitor yeah you can

4191.449 --> 4201.11
take a mirror for example or subject

4197.33 --> 4204.13
yourself to artificial UV light from a

4201.11 --> 4204.13
self-made source

4241.369 --> 4249.159
yeah look space X says the Sun it's not

4247.489 --> 4253.459999999999
magic

4249.159 --> 4256.79
well it's magical especially because we

4253.46 --> 4258.38
don't understand even what it is but

4256.79 --> 4260.21
what we do know is that there is

4258.38 --> 4264.29
daylight coming from that direction

4260.21 --> 4268.25
where we see this blinding optical

4264.29 --> 4272.42
effect this apparent disk that if you're

4268.25 --> 4275.239
gonna mathematically bypass just to

4272.42 --> 4277.13
direct sight of it and start to approach

4275.239 --> 4279.11
it mathematically with some kind of

4277.13 --> 4281.4490000000005
presuppositional structure yeah then you

4279.11 --> 4284.839999999999
can imagine it must be this giant ball

4281.449 --> 4290.119
of fire or light source physical lamp

4284.84 --> 4292.67
thing but it's light it's light coming

4290.119 --> 4295.759999999999
from that direction and you see that

4292.67 --> 4298.219
very blinding disk effect at the

4295.76 --> 4303.08
epicenter of the direction the daylight

4298.219 --> 4305.81
is coming from it's you don't have proof

4303.08 --> 4306.739
it's an object it's just light coming

4305.81 --> 4308.84
from that direction

4306.739 --> 4311.119
you don't know how it's coming from that

4308.84 --> 4314.4800000000005
direction why you just know that it does

4311.119 --> 4317.259999999999
and you can predict because it does in a

4314.48 --> 4317.259999999999
cyclical way

4365.17 --> 4373.0
that well Jorge Sanford look our skin

4369.28 --> 4376.929999999999
adapts to the intensity of the daylight

4373.0 --> 4380.59
which does depend on the actual location

4376.93 --> 4382.6
on the surface of the earth there's a

4380.59 --> 4390.52
direct correlation with that day like

4382.6 --> 4392.950000000001
how strong it is so yeah but made to

4390.52 --> 4395.05
live in specific locations no but we

4392.95 --> 4397.63
have adapted to it and then if you keep

4395.05 --> 4401.95
adapting in a certain region and

4397.63 --> 4405.6
eventually that adaptation will start to

4401.95 --> 4410.92
migrate back and become epigenetic so

4405.6 --> 4415.75
the typical ideal level of skin tone

4410.92 --> 4418.6900000000005
will then naturalize in that society as

4415.75 --> 4421.78
long as it's not too open and too

4418.69 --> 4423.3099999999995
chaotic they're kind of closed off then

4421.78 --> 4424.929999999999
they will have time to adapt and they

4423.31 --> 4429.160000000001
will typically go into a certain

4424.93 --> 4431.47
direction their skin tone but the funny

4429.16 --> 4435.849999999999
thing is that technically even if you

4431.47 --> 4441.01
get like example more black people in to

4435.85 --> 4443.35
the group and then over a couple of

4441.01 --> 4449.05
generations over well maybe you've quite

4443.35 --> 4453.81
a few like say for the six eight there

4449.05 --> 4459.79
will be very little left of the original

4453.81 --> 4462.400000000001
look because that genetic group that

4459.79 --> 4464.95
then migrated will have been adapting

4462.4 --> 4467.29
over time as well and well typically

4464.95 --> 4471.0
because still human right it will then

4467.29 --> 4474.88
typically still go and favor the other

4471.0 --> 4478.11
more adapted types of that region I

4474.88 --> 4478.11
think that doesn't matter

4509.67 --> 4512.3
yeah

4513.3 --> 4516.3
yeah

4534.46 --> 4539.14
yeah that sucks more color

4556.27 --> 4559.359
[Music]

4559.88 --> 4572.43
that's it the hazard that's exactly kind

4569.64 --> 4575.58
of the the size and age I was when I was

4572.43 --> 4577.8
doing that stuff like it really gets

4575.58 --> 4581.73
interesting like after you're seven or

4577.8 --> 4584.1
eight if you're too small you're you're

4581.73 --> 4587.879999999999
not careful enough so it's just not that

4584.1 --> 4589.71
appealing because it's too dangerous but

4587.88 --> 4596.4800000000005
unless you're like a real natural thrill

4589.71 --> 4596.4800000000005
seeker they got firecrackers

4607.769 --> 4619.289000000001
what do you think SpaceX says that's can

4615.09 --> 4625.889
be serious an entire pretext of global

4619.289 --> 4632.34
warming is based on ya spherical earth

4625.889 --> 4634.71
nonsense literally so based on the

4632.34 --> 4637.7390000000005
premise that the heliocentric model is

4634.71 --> 4640.849
true in some way does everything about

4637.739 --> 4640.848999999999
it makes no sense

4653.8 --> 4658.579000000001
look we're in a container the only real

4656.75 --> 4663.92
thing that matters is that we don't

4658.579 --> 4667.159
balloon ourselves to death that's the

4663.92 --> 4671.36
only real environmental concern and we

4667.159 --> 4673.159
must prevent mind controller grab lers

4671.36 --> 4676.369
elites whatever you want to call them

4673.159 --> 4681.5599999999995
sadness from fooling us into believing

4676.369 --> 4684.679
that some kind of base life element or

4681.56 --> 4687.349
thing that that's really of no concern

4684.679 --> 4689.6900000000005
is a big concern and then everything

4687.349 --> 4694.76
must fall in line to exclude that that

4689.69 --> 4696.5599999999995
kind of like industrial censorship let's

4694.76 --> 4699.219
prevent that at all costs it's

4696.56 --> 4701.329000000001
ridiculous only thing that should be

4699.219 --> 4705.679
avoided is things that are actually

4701.329 --> 4710.719
toxic actually bring problems we must

4705.679 --> 4713.59
not let delusion have a grip on the

4710.719 --> 4716.719
determination of these things if we do

4713.59 --> 4721.09
then the whole world can do whatever

4716.719 --> 4723.17
think whatever they want it'll all die

4721.09 --> 4725.150000000001
because we're eventually gonna get

4723.17 --> 4727.7300000000005
polluted and the problem is the bigger

4725.15 --> 4732.219
the more pollution it's just nothing

4727.73 --> 4732.218999999999
that people can or even will do about it

4732.25 --> 4739.69
unless it's like in their direct

4734.27 --> 4742.820000000001
environment so it's critical take

4739.69 --> 4747.848999999999
environmentalism out of the hands of the

4742.82 --> 4751.09
Satanists that we give real

4747.849 --> 4753.9800000000005
environmentalist leftists genuine

4751.09 --> 4756.889
leftist like liberal not the insane

4753.98 --> 4760.5199999999995
demonic freaks of these days we give

4756.889 --> 4765.52
them a genuine reference frame a

4760.52 --> 4772.179
platform back in order to be that

4765.52 --> 4776.1990000000005
sensible reliable part that prevents

4772.179 --> 4781.7300000000005
humanity from polluting itself to death

4776.199 --> 4784.339999999999
it's critical take away environmentalism

4781.73 --> 4787.28
out of the hands of the Satanists out of

4784.34 --> 4791.92
the hands of the absolute liars

4787.28 --> 4791.92
and destroyers stories of truth

4801.369 --> 4803.88
yeah

4812.629 --> 4821.169
you're protecting the oil industry at

4814.669 --> 4821.169
all costs right yeah stop it

4823.31 --> 4832.34
look let the industry do what they do

4828.55 --> 4835.7300000000005
doesn't matter it's all a cover-up

4832.34 --> 4838.1900000000005
anyway the oil industry practically

4835.73 --> 4840.0199999999995
invented climate change they've been

4838.19 --> 4841.61
working everything on it it's their

4840.02 --> 4845.570000000001
control system that they will have the

4841.61 --> 4847.82
littlest burden up from in relation to

4845.57 --> 4850.429999999999
everything else and that's how they

4847.82 --> 4856.67
offset the actual value of what they've

4850.43 --> 4860.030000000001
done it's a huge world wide industrial

4856.67 --> 4863.93
financial scam one of the biggest

4860.03 --> 4867.5
financial industrial scams has ever been

4863.93 --> 4872.990000000001
subjected to this world and it's based

4867.5 --> 4876.26
on fooling the world public that one of

4872.99 --> 4880.15
the most critical components of life and

4876.26 --> 4880.150000000001
the life cycle is a poison

4884.58 --> 4892.5599999999995
it's like I I'm not even gonna say what

4887.61 --> 4895.46
I think that these people deserve but

4892.56 --> 4899.22
they need to be stopped

4895.46 --> 4901.79
true environmentalism needs breathing

4899.22 --> 4901.79
room

4906.89 --> 4910.299
[Music]

4912.969 --> 4919.83
no SpaceX says no and stop manipulating

4916.84 --> 4929.35
me are are you Allenby or something I

4919.83 --> 4932.469
don't like the way you ask questions why

4929.35 --> 4935.38
do flat earth is why would we need to

4932.469 --> 4941.4890000000005
link up with environment don't you get

4935.38 --> 4943.81
it that this point it's all just doing

4941.489 --> 4946.36
it's already corrupted all the

4943.81 --> 4949.360000000001
organizations are only about climate

4946.36 --> 4954.66
change [ __ ] or some micro local

4949.36 --> 4954.66
concern all of it

4956.98 --> 4962.709999999999
No there needs to be a reboot of

4960.51 --> 4966.34
environmental it literally needs to be

4962.71 --> 4968.38
reinvented and you can only do that from

4966.34 --> 4970.42
the grassroots by literally setting the

4968.38 --> 4973.63
example by telling it how it needs to be

4970.42 --> 4976.4800000000005
and then getting people that are still

4973.63 --> 4979.21
young and that's so ingrained in the

4976.48 --> 4981.16
financial or power hierarchies that come

4979.21 --> 4983.62
with these corrupted environmentalist

4981.16 --> 4985.57
organizations they really do care

4983.62 --> 4987.91
because all of them usually do really

4985.57 --> 4989.92
care about the environment as they enter

4987.91 --> 4992.05
it and those are the people that we

4989.92 --> 4996.91
desperately need to realize this

4992.05 --> 5000.89
specific message to how horrific Lee

4996.91 --> 5004.65
they are being fooled and abused like

5000.89 --> 5008.75
bitterly psychologically abused for

5004.65 --> 5011.849999999999
their good nature to literally attack

5008.75 --> 5015.12
that which not needs to be attacked

5011.85 --> 5017.01
- absolutely nullify the effectiveness

5015.12 --> 5020.19
of their goodness that they wish to

5017.01 --> 5024.18
insert into the world that myth that

5020.19 --> 5025.889999999999
message needs to be relayed on the young

5024.18 --> 5033.71
people that care about the environment

5025.89 --> 5036.33
like nothing else and I think that any

5033.71 --> 5043.95
political force that opposes it should

5036.33 --> 5045.48
be harshly dealt with I think there

5043.95 --> 5048.21
should be a lot of power a lot of

5045.48 --> 5054.379999999999
political force from any side to get

5048.21 --> 5058.08
them out of the way not saying like go

5054.38 --> 5060.57
super violent but just it needs to go it

5058.08 --> 5066.0599999999995
needs to get off the stage it needs to

5060.57 --> 5067.98
be erased from media that thing needs to

5066.06 --> 5072.3
be over it's done

5067.98 --> 5075.36
no more climate change [ __ ] arrest

5072.3 --> 5078.900000000001
Al Gore arrest him confiscate all his

5075.36 --> 5081.8099999999995
freakin property and redistributed to

5078.9 --> 5088.58
the countries that has been leeched for

5081.81 --> 5088.580000000001
taxes by this shitty shitty satanic scam

5126.69 --> 5135.098999999999
right so how do you defeat the oil

5130.48 --> 5137.678999999999
companies how do you do that by ending

5135.099 --> 5140.59
the climate change nonsense then

5137.679 --> 5143.4400000000005
exposing the oil companies for being the

5140.59 --> 5148.360000000001
literal founders and instigators of it

5143.44 --> 5151.619
and then arrest them arrest them for

5148.36 --> 5156.639
their their psychological societal

5151.619 --> 5160.65
monopolization their massive power abuse

5156.639 --> 5163.63
unheard-of power abuse to literally

5160.65 --> 5167.65
mind-control the world into a giant

5163.63 --> 5174.25
cultish scam the leech of their life

5167.65 --> 5181.058999999999
force arrest them arrest the

5174.25 --> 5185.619
conspirators and after that you leave

5181.059 --> 5190.84
the industry to their what it is you

5185.619 --> 5195.5199999999995
know because hey if if there's better

5190.84 --> 5197.079
ways then let it be let it transform let

5195.52 --> 5201.309
it become what it is I don't think we

5197.079 --> 5203.61
need to lose oil in its ways I don't

5201.309 --> 5206.139
think we do but I don't think that

5203.61 --> 5208.808999999999
anybody at this point still degrees that

5206.139 --> 5212.05
we are really dependent on it as a

5208.809 --> 5215.7390000000005
system because there's other ways and

5212.05 --> 5219.84
not talking about freaking solar panels

5215.739 --> 5222.94
or wind meals or even anything like that

5219.84 --> 5225.809
there's just better ways to do it

5222.94 --> 5228.07
completely different approaches and

5225.809 --> 5230.4400000000005
there's people would be all the free

5228.07 --> 5232.869
energy well yeah we could try it maybe

5230.44 --> 5234.5199999999995
but again there can be consequences for

5232.869 --> 5236.38
literally starting to tap energy out of

5234.52 --> 5239.679
the ether what if the freakin Sun starts

5236.38 --> 5242.53
to dim down like noticeably empirically

5239.679 --> 5248.38
measurably ok yeah it's not necessarily

5242.53 --> 5251.559
the solution but this this monopoly

5248.38 --> 5254.59
power of oil and the financialization

5251.559 --> 5258.639
and everything that has become it's just

5254.59 --> 5261.28
a huge detriment to societal development

5258.639 --> 5263.079
and they've kept it that way by control

5261.28 --> 5268.869
by creating a controlled opposition

5263.079 --> 5271.179
called manmade climate change and the

5268.869 --> 5274.119
only way to end it is to end the

5271.179 --> 5279.249
controlled opposition and then take them

5274.119 --> 5282.82
down and then let the corrupted be taken

5279.249 --> 5286.148999999999
out get out of the way arrested and then

5282.82 --> 5290.558999999999
let the thing settle an industry figure

5286.149 --> 5293.320000000001
itself out and hey why would we have to

5290.559 --> 5296.53
lose cars or diesel trucks I think that

5293.32 --> 5298.84
for example diesel trucks and diesel

5296.53 --> 5302.32
cars may have a very bright future with

5298.84 --> 5305.139
a very minimal consumption of substance

5302.32 --> 5307.268999999999
and the pollution could be less and less

5305.139 --> 5308.919
and less that's the whole thing it's

5307.269 --> 5312.099
just because of this climate change is

5308.919 --> 5314.349
not fixed it's not it's a drawing away

5312.099 --> 5316.78
of the attention of actual industrial

5314.349 --> 5319.57
progress that would take money away out

5316.78 --> 5322.3
of the the masses of oil and [ __ ] that

5319.57 --> 5325.148999999999
is needed from the oil producers in

5322.3 --> 5328.959
order to account for the non upgrading

5325.149 --> 5332.019
technology that's what that is okay in

5328.959 --> 5336.999
the street we got you we got you by the

5332.019 --> 5341.079000000001
balls you ain't you ain't gonna continue

5336.999 --> 5345.03
this scam anymore because that's what it

5341.079 --> 5350.59
is man-made climate change is an oil

5345.03 --> 5351.789
magnate oil an oil oil mega corporation

5350.59 --> 5354.729
scam that's what it is

5351.789 --> 5358.78
that's exactly what it is they created

5354.729 --> 5362.05
it they founded it maybe was fought up

5358.78 --> 5364.84
by some think-tank at the UN or whatever

5362.05 --> 5369.51
but they're the ones that literally took

5364.84 --> 5369.51
it into their hands and created it a

5372.179 --> 5375.78
really good servant

5381.65 --> 5390.49
they have any insight that contradict my

5384.89 --> 5390.490000000001
statements if so please enlighten me

5399.11 --> 5402.759999999999
[Music]

5403.81 --> 5414.410000000001
okay yeah yeah guys sometimes it's still

5412.85 --> 5418.9400000000005
tough you know when I do things very

5414.41 --> 5420.889999999999
seriously it's like I'm swinging my

5418.94 --> 5423.86
sword and sometimes somebody can say

5420.89 --> 5426.110000000001
something and it just seems off and I'm

5423.86 --> 5428.299999999999
almost like because I'm in the middle of

5426.11 --> 5432.17
hammering I'm almost like yeah maybe I

5428.3 --> 5436.900000000001
should do that and it just means it

5432.17 --> 5442.7300000000005
wasn't just it would be nice if

5436.9 --> 5449.2699999999995
everybody could ensure that but I know

5442.73 --> 5451.16
check communication is not ideal and

5449.27 --> 5454.42
there is of course a time delay problem

5451.16 --> 5457.3099999999995
you're getting the video material later

5454.42 --> 5459.71
because I really wish that I would just

5457.31 --> 5461.780000000001
see I would say something you would

5459.71 --> 5464.36
immediately hear it and you just type it

5461.78 --> 5467.66
down and I could see it so it would be

5464.36 --> 5472.3099999999995
like I could translate the literal chat

5467.66 --> 5473.93
into verbals on the spot as if you were

5472.31 --> 5477.38
communicating interactively but

5473.93 --> 5480.76
unfortunately there's a there's quite

5477.38 --> 5480.76
some delay for a lot of people

5483.92 --> 5490.5
yeah so sorry to my audience if I

5487.949 --> 5500.24
sometimes get a little a little rowdy

5490.5 --> 5503.37
like her but I know good serving is like

5500.24 --> 5503.37
[Music]

5505.25 --> 5511.969
there's no way that guy could have been

5508.23 --> 5516.2699999999995
a troll I know him too well

5511.969 --> 5522.5
and we shared some really personal

5516.27 --> 5525.150000000001
things as well so I've confidence in him

5522.5 --> 5530.28
but still you see even with that I can

5525.15 --> 5533.42
get kind of like her it's like it feels

5530.28 --> 5537.08
like I'm a bear and I'm getting poked

5533.42 --> 5537.08
that's what it feels like

5554.25 --> 5561.72
yeah I'm sure you do ignorance is bliss

5558.77 --> 5564.63
it's nothing more calm than literally

5561.72 --> 5568.95
knowing nothing less you get really

5564.63 --> 5576.09
bored though around crazy ideas can

5568.95 --> 5579.72
arrive you quite crazy yeah but yeah I'm

5576.09 --> 5581.7300000000005
pretty sure about chemtrails because I

5579.72 --> 5584.9400000000005
paid attention to the skies a lot when I

5581.73 --> 5593.45
was a kid and there were no chemtrails

5584.94 --> 5600.599999999999
before 1995 there were sometimes planes

5593.45 --> 5603.15
spraying things like on purpose I've

5600.6 --> 5612.63
seen plane plane spraying things like in

5603.15 --> 5617.0
industry what is it then is that with

5612.63 --> 5617.0
farming and everything spraying on land

5617.03 --> 5622.71
what are water fire extinguishing planes

5620.58 --> 5624.54
and whatever I just didn't see any

5622.71 --> 5627.42
chemtrails the way that they are now

5624.54 --> 5629.64
there were contrails there will never be

5627.42 --> 5633.66
the strife there will never be this this

5629.64 --> 5636.47
hazy crap before 95 because that's when

5633.66 --> 5636.47
they started it up

5655.239 --> 5660.79
yeah that's right so there's even more

5658.03 --> 5662.5599999999995
opportunities now for cam trailing that

5660.79 --> 5666.58
means that they can make it even less

5662.56 --> 5669.46
conspicuous because of all the options

5666.58 --> 5672.34
they don't have to maximize the output

5669.46 --> 5677.71
with every opportunity now in the system

5672.34 --> 5679.21
that they use to output it so they have

5677.71 --> 5681.52
a choice when to do it and they can use

5679.21 --> 5682.83
that to kind of cover up wait for it but

5681.52 --> 5686.56
that's why they don't necessarily

5682.83 --> 5690.73
chemtrail every single day because they

5686.56 --> 5695.7300000000005
got enough planes enough space to divide

5690.73 --> 5700.169999999999
the cam trailing in a more refined way

5695.73 --> 5700.169999999999
that's right turn up though

5705.29 --> 5712.91
now that's that's not even necessarily

5708.17 --> 5716.14
true more colored there is indications

5712.91 --> 5719.2699999999995
that there is stuff that it can be added

5716.14 --> 5721.64
but I've also just seen planes that have

5719.27 --> 5724.42
just these chemtrail exhausts is just a

5721.64 --> 5724.42
different exhaust

5736.889 --> 5743.849
why would I need a soil sample what this

5741.869 --> 5747.449
stuff happens every day

5743.849 --> 5751.999
what would a soil sample prove when it's

5747.449 --> 5754.499
gonna be pretty much everywhere and I

5751.999 --> 5756.659
don't even know what they're exactly

5754.499 --> 5761.059
spraying I just know how matter

5756.659 --> 5766.409
typically behaves and water does not

5761.059 --> 5770.7300000000005
spread out like a cloud of dust and form

5766.409 --> 5774.598999999999
like desert ripples now dust does that

5770.73 --> 5775.049999999999
water doesn't do that clouds don't do

5774.599 --> 5776.969
that

5775.05 --> 5779.909000000001
they don't spread out like that

5776.969 --> 5782.039
contrails don't do that that's that

5779.909 --> 5785.4
that's the difference I don't know what

5782.039 --> 5787.32
it is it could literally be dust I've

5785.4 --> 5788.969
even considered this I've said it I

5787.32 --> 5791.969
don't know if they're spraying chemicals

5788.969 --> 5794.82
they could but if they're gonna spray

5791.969 --> 5798.36
crema chemicals what's to say it's gonna

5794.82 --> 5800.82
be visible you know that it's visible

5798.36 --> 5802.768999999999
that it's dust is not an indication that

5800.82 --> 5805.86
it is some kind of poison now it just

5802.769 --> 5809.13
means it's not water and they could be

5805.86 --> 5811.409
doing geoengineering things based on

5809.13 --> 5815.249
just artificially introducing dusts

5811.409 --> 5817.98
which naturally before they used before

5815.249 --> 5821.999
they started geoengineering dust would

5817.98 --> 5824.489
have typical effects like dust from the

5821.999 --> 5828.989
Sahara would blow vast distances and

5824.489 --> 5831.928999999999
then have an influence so it could be

5828.989 --> 5835.53
they're just literally spraying a bunch

5831.929 --> 5838.13
of fine sand silicon I don't know what

5835.53 --> 5838.13
they're spraying

5839.619 --> 5847.989
Oh what so draw it up da so you're gonna

5844.71 --> 5850.78
take soil samples to detect if they are

5847.989 --> 5851.709999999999
sand in the soil join up though are you

5850.78 --> 5858.21
gonna do that

5851.71 --> 5858.21
it's brilliant it's a brilliant strategy

5861.28 --> 5864.599999999999
[Music]

5878.059 --> 5883.6990000000005
what does the chemtrail do then it

5880.19 --> 5885.919999999999
spreads out and becomes a cloud just

5883.699 --> 5889.039
like dust does its what fine

5885.92 --> 5892.67
particulates do in the high atmosphere

5889.039 --> 5894.7699999999995
and they have an effect on cloud

5892.67 --> 5899.2300000000005
formation because eventually water is

5894.77 --> 5902.42
drawn to that so it changes the the

5899.23 --> 5909.169999999999
hydrodynamic the high growth and the

5902.42 --> 5910.7300000000005
hydrodynamics it plays into that it's

5909.17 --> 5912.59
it's geoengineering

5910.73 --> 5914.75
that's what it is and hey there's

5912.59 --> 5918.039
admitted programs to this official

5914.75 --> 5922.309
programs engaged

5918.039 --> 5925.07
do you know join up now that it's

5922.309 --> 5928.070000000001
officially engaged geoengineering

5925.07 --> 5930.53
programs admit it they don't call it cam

5928.07 --> 5935.259999999999
truss they call it geoengineering it's

5930.53 --> 5935.259999999999
official did you know that Journal Dow

5944.55 --> 5953.37
oh the Aryan comes to fantasy goodie

5947.73 --> 5956.7
yeah well I'm not so worried I think

5953.37 --> 5960.15
that yeah the potent the potential to

5956.7 --> 5962.5199999999995
spray secret poison or whatever do

5960.15 --> 5965.7
something yeah I think that is mostly a

5962.52 --> 5967.950000000001
new spring forth of public fear porn

5965.7 --> 5969.8099999999995
fear of the secret of the Dark One's of

5967.95 --> 5970.71
the government I think it's mostly

5969.81 --> 5973.59
feared porn

5970.71 --> 5975.87
although the dead thing may actually be

5973.59 --> 5978.51
happening in regions but if it does it's

5975.87 --> 5980.73
going to be regional the entire world is

5978.51 --> 5983.01
not literally being chemically killed

5980.73 --> 5986.849999999999
off by chemtrails that was an original

5983.01 --> 5988.68
hype assertion which I am absolutely

5986.85 --> 5992.33
hundred percent certain that it is

5988.68 --> 5996.240000000001
absolute nonsense never was that

5992.33 --> 5998.82
nonsense because if it was twenty-five

5996.24 --> 6005.87
years later yeah half nature would be

5998.82 --> 6007.61
dead maybe some place it is I don't

6005.87 --> 6011.3
think so not over here anyway

6007.61 --> 6013.839999999999
but geoengineering is happening its

6011.3 --> 6013.84
admitted

6026.28 --> 6034.469999999999
yeah during opt-out I know because

6029.36 --> 6037.62
conspiracy scene has been infected by

6034.47 --> 6040.4400000000005
Savannah a complex it's not just flat

6037.62 --> 6043.08
earth everything everything everything

6040.44 --> 6046.0199999999995
can traverse it's also fun yes and what

6043.08 --> 6048.45
it does it's like a virus or bacteria

6046.02 --> 6051.120000000001
and this is metaphorical because I

6048.45 --> 6053.58
usually don't rely upon that in for my

6051.12 --> 6056.01
real wisdom anymore it's like an

6053.58 --> 6058.2
infection it's taken over and as long as

6056.01 --> 6059.55
it's there it's in flames there's

6058.2 --> 6061.98
nothing coming out of it because they're

6059.55 --> 6066.03
all preoccupied with polarization with a

6061.98 --> 6068.879999999999
pecking order with [ __ ] basic [ __ ]

6066.03 --> 6072.24
so they're just sitting in a research

6068.88 --> 6075.3
chair using it as some kind of kingly

6072.24 --> 6077.13
Authority rather than actually figuring

6075.3 --> 6079.56
out what is real and presenting that

6077.13 --> 6082.9800000000005
know that just trying to get influenced

6079.56 --> 6085.160000000001
and that's the huge societal problem

6082.98 --> 6088.919999999999
culturally that we're now dealing with

6085.16 --> 6091.65
the Savannah complex and it is taking

6088.92 --> 6093.24
over all of conspiracy theory and

6091.65 --> 6094.98
there's still genuine research but yeah

6093.24 --> 6097.71
there's a lot of savonius out there

6094.98 --> 6099.929999999999
tension whining grabby discouraging

6097.71 --> 6102.12
people that make everyone hate that

6099.93 --> 6103.5
subject and it's a natural complex it's

6102.12 --> 6104.01
being fed into that's why it's getting

6103.5 --> 6108.03
bigger

6104.01 --> 6114.02
it's the automated self-destruct if we

6108.03 --> 6118.23
let it get big enough we let it consume

6114.02 --> 6121.410000000001
all of media space and be the soul

6118.23 --> 6124.2
feeding into that it's like the

6121.41 --> 6127.849999999999
arrangement that potentially could come

6124.2 --> 6130.8
from it in the future can be staggering

6127.85 --> 6132.51
so I think that's a huge cultural

6130.8 --> 6135.33
problem Savannah complex and

6132.51 --> 6139.08
psychologically we need to fight against

6135.33 --> 6141.6
this everything we got and the ironic

6139.08 --> 6143.19
thing and that the very fighting process

6141.6 --> 6145.740000000001
even saying that it's kind of misleading

6143.19 --> 6148.98
because the way to do it is not to fight

6145.74 --> 6153.32
because the fighting is the problem the

6148.98 --> 6153.32
fighting is the problem

6162.46 --> 6165.09
yeah

6177.08 --> 6183.98
or how do you know they are they lie oh

6179.33 --> 6186.14
hi oh how do you know that they are if

6183.98 --> 6189.0199999999995
you got empirical evidence look if you

6186.14 --> 6191.27
got situation when it's like hey this is

6189.02 --> 6194.660000000001
something happening we don't see that

6191.27 --> 6196.820000000001
our very often huh in that evening ah I

6194.66 --> 6198.38
got giant allergic reactions it lasts

6196.82 --> 6200.09
for so long and then it's going away

6198.38 --> 6202.85
again you don't see the event again yeah

6200.09 --> 6204.71
that's a pretty empirical piece of data

6202.85 --> 6207.9400000000005
that you could could have gathered for

6204.71 --> 6210.5
yourself to say that it is an allergic

6207.94 --> 6211.759999999999
reaction to chemtrails but it doesn't

6210.5 --> 6214.52
mean that every time an allergic

6211.76 --> 6217.400000000001
reaction happens during chemtrails that

6214.52 --> 6219.38
you can then just say oh yes you see

6217.4 --> 6222.95
like correlation so it must be the cause

6219.38 --> 6227.93
no you don't know that it's more hype

6222.95 --> 6231.11
it's more safe Aigner extract panic hype

6227.93 --> 6234.62
Oh chemical reaction oh this or they're

6231.11 --> 6237.44
poison you're killing it all this panic

6234.62 --> 6239.21
please panic panic about the chemtrails

6237.44 --> 6240.86
we're all gonna die their mind

6239.21 --> 6247.96
controlling us they're gonna erase our

6240.86 --> 6247.96
minds mm-hmm it's dumb

6254.84 --> 6257.84
yeah

6260.81 --> 6265.6900000000005
sorry if that hurts your feelings by the

6262.85 --> 6268.700000000001
way I'm not excluding that no one ever

6265.69 --> 6272.839999999999
could have actually experienced some

6268.7 --> 6276.26
kind of spray because I did say earlier

6272.84 --> 6279.4400000000005
right yeah they can do that and they

6276.26 --> 6283.070000000001
probably have for example there was a

6279.44 --> 6285.25
thing about the Morgellons disease just

6283.07 --> 6287.929999999999
presumed to be an experiment in

6285.25 --> 6290.69
nanotechnology that damn well think that

6287.93 --> 6293.51
they did spray that it's very specific

6290.69 --> 6295.94
regions and there's like empirical data

6293.51 --> 6299.09
about that that I've seen at the time so

6295.94 --> 6302.179999999999
yeah they did spray things and they do

6299.09 --> 6305.27
and may in the future also spray things

6302.18 --> 6308.38
but it's not gonna be oh they're

6305.27 --> 6312.5
constantly know you just don't know you

6308.38 --> 6314.84
don't know they can't tell until you're

6312.5 --> 6316.55
affected or until your intuition just

6314.84 --> 6320.150000000001
tells you like there's something off

6316.55 --> 6323.54
there's something off I got a I gotta

6320.15 --> 6326.259999999999
take cover or get away but yeah if

6323.54 --> 6329.72
you're gonna be panicked all day like oh

6326.26 --> 6332.4800000000005
yeah you think you can distinguish from

6329.72 --> 6335.21
that instinct no that's exactly what it

6332.48 --> 6336.83
kills it kills the real instinct they're

6335.21 --> 6339.11
real dangerous you know the one that

6336.83 --> 6342.5
animals have they know what shit's

6339.11 --> 6344.36
coming because they're not panicking

6342.5 --> 6349.63
because they're not [ __ ]

6344.36 --> 6349.63
Savan yeas that drown in fear porn

6352.09 --> 6358.21
because if they did they die quick

6362.17 --> 6366.04
especially if they were prey animals

6364.68 --> 6369.26
[Music]

6366.04 --> 6372.88
nothing more important to prey animals

6369.26 --> 6375.62
than to have calmness and composure

6372.88 --> 6378.26
because predators smell that [ __ ] and

6375.62 --> 6380.72
the same goes for predators among the

6378.26 --> 6385.400000000001
humans this the grapplers they smell

6380.72 --> 6388.22
that [ __ ] so ya think they're not gonna

6385.4 --> 6390.32
Corral you so Vanya is you think you're

6388.22 --> 6394.070000000001
beating them they can't handle your

6390.32 --> 6396.0199999999995
truth no they're all corralling you in

6394.07 --> 6401.179999999999
the media they're corralling you like a

6396.02 --> 6404.330000000001
bunch of overconfident sheep corralling

6401.18 --> 6406.1900000000005
you I'll square a new output putting

6404.33 --> 6409.28
fences around you they got plans for you

6406.19 --> 6410.99
you bet you they have you're not gonna

6409.28 --> 6413.42
get out of it you're so stuck in your

6410.99 --> 6415.25
Stefania complex you can never get out

6413.42 --> 6417.41
of it it's so addicted you don't have

6415.25 --> 6419.99
any room to escape anymore eventually

6417.41 --> 6425.36
that's what happens when you allow

6419.99 --> 6429.44
yourself to indulge in insane darkness

6425.36 --> 6433.13
without any proper karmic guidance or

6429.44 --> 6436.25
purpose if it's just a winning strategy

6433.13 --> 6439.67
if it's a mechanical application for a

6436.25 --> 6442.79
financial gain or power all these

6439.67 --> 6445.7
motivations that drive it will take

6442.79 --> 6447.92
everything away you got that's really

6445.7 --> 6451.3099999999995
valuable and it allowed the Dark One's

6447.92 --> 6453.2300000000005
the grabbers to corral you to corral you

6451.31 --> 6456.1900000000005
in their way and you won't even see it

6453.23 --> 6459.19
you won't even care till it's too late

6456.19 --> 6459.19
yeah

6467.179 --> 6474.29
yeah so Vanya is a general it's a it's a

6470.449 --> 6477.65
new thing it's a new thing it started up

6474.29 --> 6481.25
as a meme Owen Benjamin forwarded it and

6477.65 --> 6486.07
he's used it to compare Eric Dubay with

6481.25 --> 6490.4
chiffonnier so funny--i is our

6486.07 --> 6495.799999999999
egomaniacs that thrive on fear porn

6490.4 --> 6500.179
tactics are mercilessly savage towards

6495.8 --> 6503.3
others a very sensitive toe so they

6500.179 --> 6505.909
easily get offended and they're just

6503.3 --> 6509.8
obsessed with dominating over others

6505.909 --> 6513.32
there are the the the primary

6509.8 --> 6518.54
expressions of gamma hood the gamma

6513.32 --> 6523.13
mindset and the gamma mindset is usually

6518.54 --> 6525.14
very passive-aggressive and secret King

6523.13 --> 6527.09
is you won't be on top of everything but

6525.14 --> 6530.2390000000005
you don't want to earn it you want to

6527.09 --> 6531.92
trick everything and and there's much

6530.239 --> 6534.349999999999
more to it I'm not the best expert to

6531.92 --> 6538.51
explain it so yeah it's a lot it's a

6534.35 --> 6542.4400000000005
it's a modern psychological societal

6538.51 --> 6542.4400000000005
conceptualization and it's a new thing

6542.59 --> 6550.52
Asif Anya is a new phenomena and it's

6547.04 --> 6553.969
come out of social media just like a

6550.52 --> 6557.780000000001
troll is everybody knows what a troll is

6553.969 --> 6560.39
right aren't you asking me huh hey Arwen

6557.78 --> 6565.009999999999
what what's this word troll you keep on

6560.39 --> 6569.4800000000005
using you know oh you know the world

6565.01 --> 6571.9400000000005
troll why is that is it because they've

6569.48 --> 6574.37
been around for a while like since the

6571.94 --> 6575.719
90s that's when it really started up

6574.37 --> 6579.949
that's when the trolls were still kind

6575.719 --> 6582.26
of interesting right but yeah it's more

6579.949 --> 6585.169999999999
than just trolls now trolls is is

6582.26 --> 6587.900000000001
another thing no savannas are not really

6585.17 --> 6590.75
like trolls they can troll but they have

6587.9 --> 6592.759999999999
like their personal agenda they want to

6590.75 --> 6594.469
be king they want to be on the top they

6592.76 --> 6595.9400000000005
want to be better than everyone else or

6594.469 --> 6597.469
want to trick everyone into believing

6595.94 --> 6600.349999999999
that they are but ever better than

6597.469 --> 6600.83
everyone else or just want to feel that

6600.35 --> 6603.71
they are bad

6600.83 --> 6607.82
than everyone else and that people will

6603.71 --> 6609.65
suck up to them that's what they want

6607.82 --> 6612.86
that's what drives them and they dig

6609.65 --> 6614.45
into little corners of supposed niche

6612.86 --> 6617.36
information they all want to be special

6614.45 --> 6619.7
boys and I want to have the secret

6617.36 --> 6621.7699999999995
mighty weapon of truth and then they

6619.7 --> 6623.57
start attacking everyone that deviates

6621.77 --> 6628.55
from that so they're all in their own

6623.57 --> 6632.21
way fanatics as well and everything they

6628.55 --> 6638.150000000001
do usually ends up in promoting fear

6632.21 --> 6642.02
porn and just active the encouraging

6638.15 --> 6645.639999999999
social misbehavior towards specific

6642.02 --> 6649.370000000001
groups creating a polarized situation

6645.64 --> 6651.2300000000005
that is sivanna that is just so funny a

6649.37 --> 6656.75
complex that is what happens that's what

6651.23 --> 6659.509999999999
they do that is what happens and it's

6656.75 --> 6662.27
kind of natural that it arrived but it

6659.51 --> 6665.33
is it is not good it's in like an

6662.27 --> 6668.330000000001
inflammation in a certain frequency in a

6665.33 --> 6671.03
certain category of people that will get

6668.33 --> 6673.4
there and not be prepared to handle what

6671.03 --> 6675.139999999999
will happen to them they will make poor

6673.4 --> 6677.12
choices because they arrived there

6675.14 --> 6680.33
through bad information even as they are

6677.12 --> 6682.16
trying to escape that bad information

6680.33 --> 6685.25
they do not realize yet how deep that

6682.16 --> 6687.2
bad information goes and then suddenly

6685.25 --> 6690.59
get trapped into another layer and

6687.2 --> 6693.349999999999
they'll never see it because they're

6690.59 --> 6696.62
fixated on attacking the misinformation

6693.35 --> 6698.3
in the layer above as they don't

6696.62 --> 6700.4
progress that's one of the more

6698.3 --> 6702.38
remarkable things about Savannah is is

6700.4 --> 6706.759999999999
that their actual research progress

6702.38 --> 6708.9800000000005
usually stagnates badly because they

6706.76 --> 6715.67
just get fixated on trying to attack

6708.98 --> 6717.919999999999
certain subjects and eventually they

6715.67 --> 6719.87
will migrate if because they're very

6717.92 --> 6723.14
trendy sensitive you know they want all

6719.87 --> 6725.39
the attention it's big part of it so if

6723.14 --> 6727.700000000001
somebody is said something and

6725.39 --> 6729.59
everybody's talking about they will talk

6727.7 --> 6732.83
about it will they talk about it better

6729.59 --> 6734.349
than everyone else they have no shame

6732.83 --> 6736.629
they want to be

6734.349 --> 6738.849
most whiny most attention grabby people

6736.629 --> 6742.599
that's usually what did they end up as

6738.849 --> 6744.28
if they they're ambitious enough they

6742.599 --> 6747.159000000001
have the connections too shameless

6744.28 --> 6748.509999999999
enough and if they have at least song

6747.159 --> 6754.329
based talent because they have no

6748.51 --> 6757.359
talents it's just yeah right well Amanda

6754.329 --> 6759.308999999999
young you can call it psychopath I don't

6757.359 --> 6761.649
know if it necessarily is I think it is

6759.309 --> 6762.689
more like an artificial psychopathic

6761.649 --> 6765.579000000001
side effect

6762.689 --> 6768.789000000001
it's a comp it's a complex it's a

6765.579 --> 6771.459
psychological effect you don't have to

6768.789 --> 6773.768999999999
be a psychopath to become a Savannah and

6771.459 --> 6778.989
the contrary I think it doesn't really

6773.769 --> 6782.1990000000005
work sociopaths is something else

6778.989 --> 6785.468999999999
Psychopaths no I don't think so although

6782.199 --> 6787.329
they could but they would not be as

6785.469 --> 6789.219
passionate like the one thing some

6787.329 --> 6794.969
onions do have they have a lot of ego

6789.219 --> 6794.969
passion they really care so much and

6795.599 --> 6802.929
real Psychopaths don't really they

6798.82 --> 6807.398999999999
rarely or some yeah often they just

6802.929 --> 6809.559
don't feel they don't feel about that

6807.399 --> 6811.780000000001
they don't really care they can act that

6809.559 --> 6815.459
they care that's the difference real

6811.78 --> 6815.459
Savannah is not a psychopath

6817.52 --> 6824.55
although they can be absolute demons but

6821.34 --> 6826.56
a demon and a psychopath is not

6824.55 --> 6829.2
necessarily the same thing the demon is

6826.56 --> 6832.110000000001
more about the frequency of what you're

6829.2 --> 6834.84
doing and the direct results and social

6832.11 --> 6837.99
implications psychopath is about the

6834.84 --> 6839.91
structure that is behind it is a certain

6837.99 --> 6841.95
way of functioning and misfunctioning

6839.91 --> 6846.36
it's a different category it's not the

6841.95 --> 6848.82
same thing yeah just like a nurse's is

6846.36 --> 6850.259999999999
also a psychological part it's it's in a

6848.82 --> 6853.44
different level it's not about the

6850.26 --> 6856.74
behavior the demonic the behavior can be

6853.44 --> 6861.66
demonic things you do intentions can be

6856.74 --> 6863.9
demonic but what drives a person that is

6861.66 --> 6866.91
something else

6863.9 --> 6870.48
although yeah if a person allows them

6866.91 --> 6873.66
demonic behavior inside they do have

6870.48 --> 6877.2
problem they always do it's always a

6873.66 --> 6881.94
problem it doesn't matter what you're

6877.2 --> 6884.07
trying to accomplish huh anyway I think

6881.94 --> 6887.669999999999
I'm gonna round out the show it's been

6884.07 --> 6890.87
almost two hours pretty intense
