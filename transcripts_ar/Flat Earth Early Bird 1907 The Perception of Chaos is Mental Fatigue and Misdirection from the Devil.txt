29.48 --> 37.74
this

30.12 --> 37.74
[Music]

62.199 --> 67.119
good morning welcome to Flat Earth early

65.68 --> 70.47900000000001
bird number

67.119 --> 72.28
197 I'm your host Arwin and before we

70.479 --> 75.24
start the show please don't forget to

72.28 --> 77.759
share it on any platform you deem fit

75.24 --> 80.0
and if you haven't already subscribe to

77.759 --> 82.2
my channel and hit the Bell notification

80.0 --> 84.439
so we know when I'm going live which is

82.2 --> 87.24000000000001
normally 2: p.m. Amsterdam time every

84.439 --> 89.27999999999999
day and please also do support me

87.24 --> 90.6
through the PayPal and the patreon that

89.28 --> 92.28
would be much appre appreciate it and I

90.6 --> 94.15899999999999
can always use the support so please

92.28 --> 98.28
keep it coming that would be

94.159 --> 102.56
great right weather today

98.28 --> 107.24000000000001
is mixed but it it just got

102.56 --> 111.04
Sunny just now look look at this look at

107.24 --> 111.03999999999999
this how beautiful that

111.119 --> 114.119
looks

115.68 --> 118.84
incredible cuz before it looked more

117.96 --> 120.83999999999999
like

118.84 --> 125.07900000000001
that

120.84 --> 128.799
but that moved away now and made way for

125.079 --> 128.799
this it's a nice

137.8 --> 140.8
Sun

147.44 --> 154.239
great right

151.48 --> 158.04
hello LSG first in chat good to see

154.239 --> 158.04
you it's raining over

158.08 --> 165.8
there uh right it is Thursday the 28th

163.159 --> 165.79999999999998
of March

172.68 --> 181.28
2024 temperature is 11°

177.12 --> 183.56
C oh it's a twirly line day

181.28 --> 186.56
apparently

183.56 --> 186.56
okay

188.2 --> 195.07999999999998
weird we'll see about

191.239 --> 195.08
that right now it's kind of

203.879 --> 212.28
sunny right so yeah don't have a title

208.76 --> 212.28
today for a

219.799 --> 225.799
change but I will have an Illuminati C

222.519 --> 227.72
on later so I'm looking forward to

225.799 --> 232.36
that and

227.72 --> 232.35999999999999
yeah talk about whatever we

237.159 --> 244.599
like listen to Info Wars for the first

240.12 --> 244.59900000000002
time yesterday oh okay

245.04 --> 250.72
wow yeah I was quite busy over Info Wars

248.799 --> 253.92000000000002
quite

250.72 --> 253.92
the the

256.44 --> 264.71999999999997
Ruckus Alex inviting the rabbi

261.24 --> 267.56
Shoon which is was like completely

264.72 --> 271.72
insane and then after that Owen Benjamin

267.56 --> 271.72
got a little segment of half an hour

271.919 --> 275.84
so yeah it was it was

276.0 --> 279.52
interesting and very

289.11 --> 292.399
[Music]

294.039 --> 301.639
typical but uh yeah I mean it was just a

297.8 --> 301.639
big Ruckus all of that

308.44 --> 313.919
right there's some

310.8 --> 316.12
people drilling or whatever they're

313.919 --> 318.44
doing downstairs they're like working in

316.12 --> 323.52
the house so there's like constant noise

318.44 --> 323.52
it it woke me up too this morning very

323.72 --> 328.639
annoying but uh yeah there's nothing I

326.12 --> 331.639
could do about

328.639 --> 331.639
that

338.0 --> 347.12
lellow fiber outs yeah I mean it's

342.16 --> 347.12
ridiculous the guy is like a blatant

357.6 --> 365.88
clown it's yeah is just there to ruffle

361.919 --> 369.52
feathers and to be as hypocritical about

365.88 --> 373.639
as about everything as humanly

369.52 --> 375.15999999999997
possible and yeah that's exactly what

373.639 --> 378.479
happened

375.16 --> 380.59000000000003
and Alex did keep his school a

378.479 --> 382.199
lot that was

380.59 --> 384.23999999999995
[Music]

382.199 --> 385.91900000000004
admirable what do you mean you can't

384.24 --> 386.8
really have a conversation with a man

385.919 --> 388.56
like

386.8 --> 391.56
that

388.56 --> 391.56
so

394.44 --> 399.039
interested in finding more about the red

396.28 --> 402.039
haer thing

399.039 --> 402.039
really

404.479 --> 411.56
okay you were surprised Alex was so

407.639 --> 414.56
amicable well he obviously had to be and

411.56 --> 414.56
he did so

416.919 --> 422.75899999999996
admirably I mean what else can you do

419.879 --> 424.36
just like get outraged that'll only make

422.759 --> 428.0
yeah that'll only just make him look

424.36 --> 430.72
weak so he did the best he could

428.0 --> 430.72
considering the

439.8 --> 444.28000000000003
circumstances hello man go good to see

448.52 --> 453.19899999999996
you hello clutch good to see

461.4 --> 466.75899999999996
you wow I got a lot of

464.479 --> 468.28
comments I deleted some of them because

466.759 --> 471.8
they got

468.28 --> 475.75899999999996
tedious but man there are some people

471.8 --> 478.84000000000003
that really really didn't like me having

475.759 --> 480.08000000000004
any opinion whatsoever about that bridge

478.84 --> 482.44
collapse

480.08 --> 483.96
how dare you Arwin I mean if you're not

482.44 --> 487.0
a structural

483.96 --> 490.68
engineer you can't make any

487.0 --> 491.8
comments about such a thing can't have

490.68 --> 494.96
like

491.8 --> 497.68
hey was it fell off there is something

494.96 --> 500.31899999999996
wrong about it just felt weird you can't

497.68 --> 503.039
say that how dare you Arwin how dare you

500.319 --> 505.72
say that it felt kind of weird I mean

503.039 --> 508.44
it's perfectly normal everything about

505.72 --> 511.11
it was perfectly

508.44 --> 514.309
normal

511.11 --> 514.309
[Music]

516.519 --> 520.0
right hello Lou

528.24 --> 535.12
elcott troll comments not it's not even

531.44 --> 538.9590000000001
troll comments it's just the more Global

535.12 --> 542.6
Watchers and they're like oh you oh you

538.959 --> 542.5999999999999
don't even know anything about

542.839 --> 547.399
engineering like I'm sorry did I make an

545.92 --> 550.959
engineering

547.399 --> 555.2
comment except for like Yeah from what

550.959 --> 560.64
I've learned steel is like very tensile

555.2 --> 565.24
and like should it really just like

560.64 --> 565.24
Snap in multiple sections like

566.519 --> 572.92
that I don't know what in the meantime

570.12 --> 574.92
people out there are now analyzing

572.92 --> 578.04
exactly what happened and was there a

574.92 --> 579.7199999999999
Cyber attack or is it all just because

578.04 --> 583.519
of diversity

579.72 --> 587.9590000000001
highes and but nobody's actually giving

583.519 --> 587.9590000000001
any attention to the bridge it's like

588.2 --> 594.519
uh did that seem just perfectly normal

592.0 --> 598.519
in a way I'd like to actually address

594.519 --> 601.16
Structural Engineers and even the the

598.519 --> 603.88
what seemed to be

601.16 --> 606.68
bards that are probably also into

603.88 --> 611.64
engineering and all that and

606.68 --> 614.88
architecture I'd like to kind of see a

611.64 --> 617.1999999999999
maybe a physics based simulation like a

614.88 --> 620.8
a simulation for the structural

617.2 --> 624.6800000000001
Integrity of that bridge to simulate

620.8 --> 627.519
based on the knowledge of how it was

624.68 --> 630.16
constructed like the original uh

627.519 --> 632.48
simulation for its design if if there

630.16 --> 635.399
was even made any I mean the bridge was

632.48 --> 637.279
probably made quite some time ago but

635.399 --> 640.36
You Could reconstruct that and then just

637.279 --> 644.16
see like yeah would it collapse exactly

640.36 --> 646.72
like that because maybe it would maybe

644.16 --> 647.8
it would just just like that you just

646.72 --> 650.8000000000001
take

647.8 --> 654.519
this the foundational

650.8 --> 656.8389999999999
pillar you bash it in and then it all

654.519 --> 658.5600000000001
just breaks apart snaps apart and falls

656.839 --> 660.639
down like that I'd like to see that I'd

658.56 --> 663.079
like to see it

660.639 --> 665.0790000000001
an Engineers simulation a computer

663.079 --> 666.12
simulation of the bridge and what would

665.079 --> 667.8389999999999
happen

666.12 --> 671.6
if

667.839 --> 673.36
well if what happened would happen in

671.6 --> 677.16
that simulation and let's see how the

673.36 --> 680.279
bridge goes down I mean that would be

677.16 --> 680.279
worth checking

688.24 --> 691.24
out

696.2 --> 701.639
what's that

697.399 --> 701.639
clutch Bridge construction

705.68 --> 711.959
simulation Twi wit hav't seen you for a

709.88 --> 714.68
while yeah we're lucky the same

711.959 --> 716.4799999999999
Engineers explain building collapse yeah

714.68 --> 719.4399999999999
yeah yeah exact

716.48 --> 721.839
yeah that's my problem there twit witht

719.44 --> 724.8800000000001
like I feel like there's something weird

721.839 --> 729.5600000000001
about it and I mean that's it yeah it's

724.88 --> 732.04
not an engineer's opinion yeah it's just

729.56 --> 734.3599999999999
that felt weird I thought Steel's

732.04 --> 738.519
supposed to be really tensile how is it

734.36 --> 741.9590000000001
just snapping apart at multiple sections

738.519 --> 744.6
like that why wasn't it just like yeah

741.959 --> 747.4399999999999
like sure pushed over and

744.6 --> 750.12
then like just hanging down like that

747.44 --> 753.839
why why did it all snap apart it just

750.12 --> 753.839
that part seemed

754.639 --> 761.0790000000001
weird wouldn't the bridge like fall over

758.959 --> 763.4399999999999
like it got bashed in one side wouldn't

761.079 --> 765.5999999999999
it then like topple over and then pull

763.44 --> 767.72
everything but no it like bashed into it

765.6 --> 772.48
and then kabang it just goes straight

767.72 --> 777.5600000000001
down like what it just felt weird that's

772.48 --> 779.519
all yeah it's not it's just felt weird

777.56 --> 781.6389999999999
how dare you Arwin how dare you say it

779.519 --> 783.88
felt weird you're not a structural

781.639 --> 786.48
engineer you can't have any feelings

783.88 --> 786.48
about Bridge

787.68 --> 793.7199999999999
collapses yes I can and I do and I will

791.16 --> 793.7199999999999
Express

794.519 --> 800.68
that in the meantime they live truth and

798.04 --> 803.959
made another video with more geometria

800.68 --> 806.959
and more numbers and that wasn't super

803.959 --> 808.1199999999999
helpful I mean I guess I'm glad he's on

806.959 --> 811.1199999999999
it

808.12 --> 811.12
but

813.519 --> 819.92
my point was that I felt like it should

817.199 --> 821.519
sure it should collapse but it should be

819.92 --> 824.56
like

821.519 --> 826.5600000000001
hanging by the steel structure and just

824.56 --> 829.4399999999999
like be

826.56 --> 832.92
hanging falling into the water and not

829.44 --> 835.9590000000001
just simultaneously all at the same time

832.92 --> 841.04
just snap snap snap and fall down as a

835.959 --> 841.04
whole like that just seemed like weird

844.24 --> 852.36
but maybe as I suspected how dare the

848.959 --> 854.8389999999999
non-engineer have another opinion about

852.36 --> 857.0
the bridge construction maybe there was

854.839 --> 860.519
some metal

857.0 --> 863.24
fatigue could it be maybe the steel

860.519 --> 865.36
quality wasn't really up to

863.24 --> 871.04
par I don't

865.36 --> 871.04
know all these questions should be

872.839 --> 877.2790000000001
answerable right so I'm just going to

874.68 --> 879.8389999999999
ask these questions from a non-engineer

877.279 --> 884.56
standpoint from

879.839 --> 886.9590000000001
a a bit of a Layman who has architecture

884.56 --> 892.88
adjacent

886.959 --> 892.88
interests yeah and so that's what I

894.51 --> 897.639
[Music]

898.04 --> 901.04
do

903.32 --> 905.6
how

914.399 --> 918.92
funny hello linear

919.079 --> 927.959
Vu critical facts with another

923.959 --> 930.959
ridiculous nonsense distraction

927.959 --> 930.959
comment

936.72 --> 941.759
simulations are models right what a

939.44 --> 945.1600000000001
simulation be accepted if they gave

941.759 --> 948.839
adequate explanation well I just want to

945.16 --> 951.36
see it based on normal default

948.839 --> 953.44
assumptions about its

951.36 --> 956.319
construction maybe they can do some

953.44 --> 960.1600000000001
background research on the source of

956.319 --> 961.399
Steel they used for the construction

960.16 --> 965.079
etc

961.399 --> 968.199
etc just to try and

965.079 --> 970.5999999999999
reconstruct the bridge as accurately as

968.199 --> 973.319
possible and then

970.6 --> 976.639
simulate the collapse simulate the

973.319 --> 978.959
bashing of into the pillar of the ship

976.639 --> 980.639
just a simulation just to see like what

978.959 --> 984.5189999999999
would it look

980.639 --> 987.6
like would it indeed based on the known

984.519 --> 990.079
conditions of the bridge just snap apart

987.6 --> 991.8000000000001
is it like The Logical consequence of

990.079 --> 993.6389999999999
that type of

991.8 --> 996.4799999999999
architecture this is the type of

993.639 --> 996.48
question I want to

996.88 --> 1001.959
know yeah I want to know

1000.279 --> 1005.399
that

1001.959 --> 1007.4399999999999
so that's it hey you Structural

1005.399 --> 1009.92
Engineers you got a lot of time on your

1007.44 --> 1011.6800000000001
hands and you're like outrageous how

1009.92 --> 1014.759
could anybody think that there was

1011.68 --> 1017.7199999999999
anything weird about that well why

1014.759 --> 1019.48
didn't you demonstrate that to us by

1017.72 --> 1022.1990000000001
making an archit

1019.48 --> 1025.559
tecture simulation in a computer and

1022.199 --> 1027.3999999999999
just show us what happened

1025.559 --> 1032.3999999999999
before yeah

1027.4 --> 1032.4
more 9911 uh

1032.76 --> 1038.28
Engineers that supposedly explain how

1035.919 --> 1042.5200000000002
jet fuel melted the steel beams and all

1038.28 --> 1046.16
that before they take care of it and

1042.52 --> 1047.84
obviously make a nonsense thing out of

1046.16 --> 1050.3600000000001
it you

1047.84 --> 1054.039
know

1050.36 --> 1054.039
oh my God everybody's so

1054.08 --> 1059.6399999999999
triggered comments with the troll

1056.36 --> 1061.4399999999998
comments because how dare Arwin actually

1059.64 --> 1064.72
have a suspicion that there might be

1061.44 --> 1069.64
something off about it that's just

1064.72 --> 1069.64
absurd quickly quickly troll

1077.52 --> 1083.8799999999999
comments right exactly DEA there might

1080.4 --> 1088.679
have been safety issues with the overall

1083.88 --> 1091.24
design and that is a potential outcome

1088.679 --> 1093.96
of the research of

1091.24 --> 1098.32
this and that's why I even said that

1093.96 --> 1100.919
yesterday like was it like built to

1098.32 --> 1105.8799999999999
dramatically collapse like

1100.919 --> 1110.76
this was it basically already kind of

1105.88 --> 1110.7600000000002
risky these are just questions

1117.0 --> 1119.24
yes

1120.32 --> 1126.76
clutch yeah the 911 buildings yeah they

1123.64 --> 1131.0800000000002
were designed they were

1126.76 --> 1131.08
insured they were insured

1131.159 --> 1137.72
specifically for exactly what happened

1133.88 --> 1140.72
and to not collapse it it was all

1137.72 --> 1140.72
crazy

1145.6 --> 1149.48
they were talking about 911 now the

1147.679 --> 1153.52
World Trade Center buildings they were

1149.48 --> 1157.44
specifically ensured to withstand being

1153.52 --> 1157.44
hit by a passenger plane

1157.76 --> 1166.64
and and yeah it's all bizarre right but

1162.72 --> 1170.159
I mean not saying that it is it will

1166.64 --> 1172.72
measure up equally to that event I'm

1170.159 --> 1175.3200000000002
just saying it just felt off how dare

1172.72 --> 1180.039
you Arwin the nonstructural engineer how

1175.32 --> 1183.12
dare you have a feeling about what

1180.039 --> 1184.84
happened you can't have suspicions you

1183.12 --> 1186.1589999999999
can only have a suspicion if you're a

1184.84 --> 1188.9599999999998
structural

1186.159 --> 1192.72
engineer no no I can definitely have a

1188.96 --> 1192.72
suspicion without being a structural

1194.64 --> 1200.64
engineer

1197.64 --> 1200.64
anyway

1213.679 --> 1216.52
oh Orin

1220.48 --> 1229.64
Bumble yeah Richard sure did it sure

1226.159 --> 1232.1200000000001
yes yeah Richard if if you actually

1229.64 --> 1232.1200000000001
believe

1234.679 --> 1243.039
that then uh My overall opinion about

1238.72 --> 1243.039
your opinions will be severely

1243.84 --> 1246.84
downgraded

1251.0 --> 1256.72
yeah I mean if those airplanes weakened

1254.76 --> 1258.4
the fuel weakened the structural

1256.72 --> 1259.559
Integrity of the steel it would have

1258.4 --> 1262.2800000000002
done so

1259.559 --> 1265.0
locally and the worst that could have

1262.28 --> 1268.9189999999999
happened is that the building would have

1265.0 --> 1272.279
like bent and toppled the bit maybe the

1268.919 --> 1275.279
top part might have snapped off

1272.279 --> 1275.279
but

1275.559 --> 1280.9189999999999
yeah did did the fuel burning weaken the

1279.52 --> 1284.279
steel

1280.919 --> 1286.919
structure all over the entire building

1284.279 --> 1291.679
including at the

1286.919 --> 1293.95
basement I don't think so it's all quite

1291.679 --> 1301.8200000000002
ridiculous but that's another

1293.95 --> 1301.82
[Music]

1302.84 --> 1307.9189999999999
story back to another container ships in

1306.2 --> 1311.52
70s which

1307.919 --> 1315.8400000000001
was yes or in a yeah I know I mean that

1311.52 --> 1319.8799999999999
ship definitely in my opinion was

1315.84 --> 1321.8799999999999
capable of bashing

1319.88 --> 1323.48
the support pillar over I mean I'm not

1321.88 --> 1326.7990000000002
saying like that could have never

1323.48 --> 1326.799
happened that's not what I'm

1327.159 --> 1333.24
saying yeah definitely a big ship like

1330.2 --> 1336.159
that yeah it could definitely crash the

1333.24 --> 1340.24
bridge it's just felt weird how it

1336.159 --> 1340.24
collapsed that is all that's

1341.08 --> 1346.08
all that's where my suspicions are it's

1344.36 --> 1349.1589999999999
like something weird about

1346.08 --> 1353.52
it but hey that could be helped

1349.159 --> 1356.679
very easily by showing a good Bridge

1353.52 --> 1356.679
simulation of the

1362.14 --> 1366.919
[Music]

1363.919 --> 1366.919
situation

1367.44 --> 1370.63
[Music]

1373.799 --> 1378.52
oh don't have enough characters to talk

1376.96 --> 1379.8400000000001
I don't really want to talk about the

1378.52 --> 1384.0
World Trade

1379.84 --> 1384.0
Center it's just a loose

1385.48 --> 1390.2
reference I mean I'm not even really

1387.679 --> 1390.2
comparing

1390.559 --> 1396.2
it

1393.12 --> 1399.52
right well Trade Center collapse was

1396.2 --> 1401.3600000000001
like aund times more suspicious there

1399.52 --> 1403.799
was so much wrong with

1401.36 --> 1408.6399999999999
it but I mean it's

1403.799 --> 1410.96
been dug delved into endlessly by so

1408.64 --> 1412.0
many researches this almost no point

1410.96 --> 1418.3500000000001
bringing it

1412.0 --> 1418.35
[Music]

1427.2 --> 1431.48
up you want to get banned Steve

1435.039 --> 1440.76
Bronson I mean your stupid ridicule

1438.039 --> 1443.0
remark aren't going to take away my

1440.76 --> 1447.6
suspicion nor are they going to convince

1443.0 --> 1449.76
me I should drop bringing it up all you

1447.6 --> 1452.8799999999999
bunch of dumb asses are doing is

1449.76 --> 1453.799
basically encouraging me more to hold on

1452.88 --> 1457.8400000000001
to

1453.799 --> 1461.799
it just because it seems to irritate

1457.84 --> 1464.6399999999999
you for no logically good reason cuz I

1461.799 --> 1468.0
mean why wouldn't you be

1464.64 --> 1470.159
suspicious you're just being idiots

1468.0 --> 1474.96
about it right

1470.159 --> 1474.96
now your ridicule is highly

1490.36 --> 1497.6789999999999
unfounded oh okay it's was just a joke

1493.799 --> 1500.32
oh yes sure it was sure it was just a

1497.679 --> 1500.3200000000002
joke

1507.12 --> 1513.039
right all right Richard and you don't

1510.32 --> 1517.32
have to be so freaking meticulous about

1513.039 --> 1519.48
every goddamn thing you bring up okay it

1517.32 --> 1521.96
didn't melt the steel beams well if it

1519.48 --> 1525.799
would have just weakened it it makes

1521.96 --> 1529.3600000000001
even less sense Richard it's that simple

1525.799 --> 1530.96
it makes even less sense then so keep

1529.36 --> 1534.8799999999999
bringing up more

1530.96 --> 1537.48
details to emphasize how little sense

1534.88 --> 1541.3990000000001
the 911 World Trade Center collapse made

1537.48 --> 1541.3990000000001
okay just keep doing

1543.44 --> 1548.64
it you haven't even seen the bridge

1545.919 --> 1553.039
collapse wow where the hell have you

1548.64 --> 1556.88
been I mean it was very very hard to

1553.039 --> 1559.72
avoid that since it was all over the

1556.88 --> 1562.3990000000001
place all over social media all over

1559.72 --> 1566.72
YouTube all over

1562.399 --> 1568.799
X everywhere everywhere that footage

1566.72 --> 1571.6000000000001
everywhere I mean how could you have

1568.799 --> 1574.8799999999999
missed it at this point that's just

1571.6 --> 1575.6789999999999
weird that you have like two days off

1574.88 --> 1578.3990000000001
the

1575.679 --> 1579.919
internet or something I mean that's the

1578.399 --> 1582.279
only way I could explain that you

1579.919 --> 1584.679
couldn't have noticed it because every

1582.279 --> 1587.24
single website ever had some kind of

1584.679 --> 1590.24
reference to

1587.24 --> 1590.24
that

1593.08 --> 1598.559
the World Trade Center made sense to me

1595.36 --> 1601.36
well then you're a [ __ ] freak Deb D

1598.559 --> 1604.52
because it didn't make any damn sense at

1601.36 --> 1604.52
all at

1617.24 --> 1622.24
all

1619.559 --> 1622.24
yeah that's right

1634.559 --> 1639.6
gutch yeah probably twit with I mean

1637.32 --> 1642.32
it's obviously programming surrounding

1639.6 --> 1642.32
it all

1644.52 --> 1649.08
that I just want to know like how the

1646.96 --> 1651.2
hell the bridge would CL colls like that

1649.08 --> 1654.12
that is all I mean it's just

1651.2 --> 1654.1200000000001
architectural

1656.08 --> 1659.1589999999999
curiosity I

1659.96 --> 1664.1200000000001
mean I don't think like a bridge

1662.2 --> 1668.559
collapse like this has ever been

1664.12 --> 1668.559
witnessed on camera like

1671.24 --> 1677.64
that I've seen one weird footage older

1675.399 --> 1681.84
footage of a rich collapse that was like

1677.64 --> 1684.44
getting all wobbly like that was freaky

1681.84 --> 1684.4399999999998
that was on

1684.919 --> 1689.679
camera but I mean you don't see a lot of

1687.919 --> 1692.5590000000002
bridge collapses on

1689.679 --> 1695.919
camera so and this was just fullon

1692.559 --> 1695.9189999999999
filmed from all

1707.12 --> 1710.12
sides

1712.0 --> 1719.32
you're one of those people are you Steve

1714.96 --> 1719.32
Bronson okay all

1723.22 --> 1726.319
[Music]

1737.039 --> 1740.039
right

1767.039 --> 1770.039
e

1772.0 --> 1777.32
Ste would be dragged of its fixtures to

1778.12 --> 1785.6
collapse yes debatable

1782.039 --> 1789.24
D that's right it would be dragged off

1785.6 --> 1793.039
and then would it be pulled on it but

1789.24 --> 1796.039
the whole point was it snapped in

1793.039 --> 1800.039
multiple segments it snapped and fell

1796.039 --> 1803.0
down and that was what I thought was so

1800.039 --> 1803.0
unusual about

1805.039 --> 1810.76
it the snapping in multiple segments

1809.24 --> 1813.24
pretty much

1810.76 --> 1815.799
simultaneously the only thing that I

1813.24 --> 1817.76
could that I know that could do that

1815.799 --> 1821.799
outside of some kind

1817.76 --> 1826.64
of purposeful sabotage or demolition

1821.799 --> 1831.0
would be metal fatigue on a massive

1826.64 --> 1831.0
scale I'm just just curious about

1856.919 --> 1859.919
it

1879.279 --> 1883.84
all right yeah that's cute or knuckle

1880.919 --> 1888.039
wumble I've seen the

1883.84 --> 1890.1589999999999
video it just still doesn't seem logical

1888.039 --> 1895.76
that it would

1890.159 --> 1895.7600000000002
snap clean off at multiple

1896.36 --> 1904.08
segments I expected that it wouldn't

1900.08 --> 1907.9189999999999
snap off and it would simply get dragged

1904.08 --> 1910.6789999999999
down because steel has a lot of tensile

1907.919 --> 1912.72
strength that's why they use it so

1910.679 --> 1915.279
that's what I expected to see I didn't

1912.72 --> 1917.44
expect it to just snap off and just

1915.279 --> 1920.639
multiple segments simultaneously fall

1917.44 --> 1922.24
down that is all how dare you Arwin

1920.639 --> 1923.4199999999998
you're not a structural engineer you

1922.24 --> 1925.559
don't know anything about

1923.42 --> 1931.24
[Music]

1925.559 --> 1931.24
this yeah well I just think it's

1932.76 --> 1935.97
[Music]

1936.6 --> 1942.559
weird oh come on could you just shut the

1939.519 --> 1945.44
[ __ ] up already about this I don't need

1942.559 --> 1949.2
you guys regurgitating the same [ __ ]

1945.44 --> 1952.0800000000002
over and over again get a [ __ ] life

1949.2 --> 1954.48
[ __ ] show me a [ __ ] simulation or

1952.08 --> 1957.48
shut the [ __ ]

1954.48 --> 1959.519
up don't want to hear the same crap over

1957.48 --> 1962.48
and over again there like already six

1959.519 --> 1964.799
people having said that you can stop

1962.48 --> 1967.6390000000001
regurgitating the same [ __ ] over and

1964.799 --> 1967.639
over again

1976.84 --> 1979.84
okay

1991.48 --> 1996.3990000000001
yeah it snapped once the weight pulled

1994.08 --> 1998.519
it down yeah well it should have snapped

1996.399 --> 2003.1589999999999
in one

1998.519 --> 2007.279
place and then after it snapped then the

2003.159 --> 2009.88
tensile force should be greatly reduced

2007.279 --> 2012.279
in order to prevent the rest of the

2009.88 --> 2015.279
segments from

2012.279 --> 2018.039
snapping it would probably then just

2015.279 --> 2018.039
drag

2018.2 --> 2024.799
it that's what I

2020.48 --> 2027.88
expected not for the whole thing to snap

2024.799 --> 2031.44
simultaneously at multiple

2027.88 --> 2031.44
Parts like it

2036.72 --> 2039.72
did

2052.77 --> 2058.0389999999998
[Music]

2066.72 --> 2069.72
for

2070.72 --> 2074.0
yeah clutch I

2079.76 --> 2083.8390000000004
agree nobody is responding to every

2082.28 --> 2085.8790000000004
anything I say either they're just

2083.839 --> 2088.679
regurgitating the same stupid

2085.879 --> 2091.0
explanation over and over again like oh

2088.679 --> 2095.599
once the support pillar is oh it it just

2091.0 --> 2099.64
snaps or really or should it snap at one

2095.599 --> 2099.6400000000003
part and then because it snap

2099.8 --> 2108.92
the uh tensile force is greatly reduced

2105.8 --> 2110.96
because it's snapped yeah I mean it's

2108.92 --> 2113.4
like you have an elastic you pull it

2110.96 --> 2115.599
apart really hard at some point it's

2113.4 --> 2117.4
going to snap right the tensile strength

2115.599 --> 2120.92
becomes too much the force becomes too

2117.4 --> 2123.44
much is it then going to break apart in

2120.92 --> 2126.96
multiple segment

2123.44 --> 2128.2400000000002
simultaneously yeah no it's going to

2126.96 --> 2130.0
snap at

2128.24 --> 2134.3999999999996
one

2130.0 --> 2136.24
segment and then the rest is relieved

2134.4 --> 2139.359
from the tensile

2136.24 --> 2143.68
force it will just be

2139.359 --> 2143.68
pulled yeah that's my

2146.16 --> 2150.7999999999997
issue you can't post a Linker or yeah

2149.2 --> 2152.52
well you can send me an email and then

2150.8 --> 2154.88
tell me you send me an email that's what

2152.52 --> 2154.88
you can

2156.64 --> 2159.64
do

2162.319 --> 2168.68
and I don't need generic links I want to

2165.359 --> 2171.44
see Structural Engineers computer

2168.68 --> 2174.24
simulation that's what I want to see

2171.44 --> 2176.319
don't want other people regurgitating

2174.24 --> 2178.4399999999996
the same [ __ ] that you guys are keep

2176.319 --> 2179.96
rolling out yeah that's what I don't

2178.44 --> 2181.599
want to see I don't want to see a

2179.96 --> 2183.96
structural engineer that is

2181.599 --> 2186.56
regurgitating the same [ __ ] that you are

2183.96 --> 2189.56
I want to see a

2186.56 --> 2189.56
demonstration

2192.68 --> 2198.0789999999997
all right wumble if you keep that up

2195.68 --> 2202.0
I'll just kick you the [ __ ] out yeah

2198.079 --> 2202.0
don't don't talk to me like

2205.079 --> 2210.96
that don't talk to me like that stop

2209.52 --> 2215.48
being a

2216.52 --> 2219.52
there

2222.04 --> 2226.96
hello duper what the [ __ ] are you

2224.24 --> 2226.9599999999996
talking about

2227.119 --> 2230.119

[Music]

2263.4 --> 2266.4
hello duper how you

2268.24 --> 2273.72
doing do you have any opinions on the

2270.96 --> 2273.7200000000003
bridge gaps

2276.44 --> 2279.44
duper

2291.68 --> 2294.64
not saying you have

2294.76 --> 2300.88
to you haven't looked into okay

2306.44 --> 2309.44
fine

2331.56 --> 2336.04
all

2332.92 --> 2338.599
right this program doesn't allow I don't

2336.04 --> 2340.7599999999998
know duper did you you have anything to

2338.599 --> 2342.77
do with the bridge

2340.76 --> 2347.449
collapse

2342.77 --> 2347.449
[Music]

2353.839 --> 2360.72
h i mean you did just get that secret

2357.88 --> 2360.7200000000003
military

2366.359 --> 2369.359
job

2370.64 --> 2376.8599999999997
n I'm just

2371.94 --> 2376.86
[Music]

2378.599 --> 2384.04
joking I'm sure you didn't have anything

2381.079 --> 2387.319
to do with the sudden power down that

2384.04 --> 2387.319
the ship experienced or

2390.88 --> 2396.319
anything you did it how dare you you

2393.8 --> 2399.319
Luna loves

2396.319 --> 2399.319
you

2409.8 --> 2413.0
were you working on that

2420.48 --> 2425.319
ship I mean it did seem like the

2422.88 --> 2429.319
engineering crew in on the ship

2425.319 --> 2429.319
certainly messed up

2431.92 --> 2438.28
somehow right but I

2435.319 --> 2440.52
mean look the whole

2438.28 --> 2443.28
thing it as a

2440.52 --> 2446.319
whole the scenario of the rich collapse

2443.28 --> 2448.44
it really does seem like it is a like

2446.319 --> 2452.04
it's almost designed as a giant

2448.44 --> 2456.2400000000002
distracting Factor cuz there's so many

2452.04 --> 2458.96
weird things and like loose ends to

2456.24 --> 2462.3999999999996
it

2458.96 --> 2464.76
like there's like tons of people that

2462.4 --> 2467.28
are going to be doing research about

2464.76 --> 2469.28
this and going back and forth and like

2467.28 --> 2471.079
there's so much research that has to be

2469.28 --> 2473.96
done just to figure out what the hell

2471.079 --> 2477.7200000000003
happened here almost seems like it was

2473.96 --> 2480.7200000000003
all just meant like a catastrophic

2477.72 --> 2480.72
failure

2484.04 --> 2490.7599999999998
distraction as a whole it was all

2486.68 --> 2494.0
engineering failure maybe maybe twit wit

2490.76 --> 2497.28
you don't know yet we don't know why the

2494.0 --> 2497.28
power went out on that

2502.44 --> 2507.0
chip and I haven't really I've heard

2505.16 --> 2510.839
some

2507.0 --> 2513.44
explanations about like from people that

2510.839 --> 2517.2799999999997
do work that are veterans working on

2513.44 --> 2519.599
like shipping containers like that and

2517.28 --> 2522.0
that didn't seem like very conclusive

2519.599 --> 2525.839
either like they just said like no like

2522.0 --> 2529.4
the way they stered after the power out

2525.839 --> 2532.56
during the power that was all weird like

2529.4 --> 2536.92
the whole thing just seemed very

2532.56 --> 2539.64
off so this just like this crazy puzzle

2536.92 --> 2541.76
that happened and we're all just here

2539.64 --> 2546.1189999999997
just trying to figure out what the hell

2541.76 --> 2550.1600000000003
happened that seems like a major

2546.119 --> 2550.1600000000003
distraction on the grand

2556.96 --> 2561.7200000000003
scale that failed you of engineering

2559.44 --> 2563.559
yeah on the bridge part perhaps but I

2561.72 --> 2568.4399999999996
mean what what was going on with the

2563.559 --> 2571.1600000000003
ship you know apparently that same

2568.44 --> 2574.0
freighter a few years

2571.16 --> 2576.16
earlier or don't know some time ago I

2574.0 --> 2578.96
don't know when exactly I don't remember

2576.16 --> 2584.96
apparently also had an accident in

2578.96 --> 2587.88
Belgium like ramming the coast ramming a

2584.96 --> 2592.52
harbor like crashing into it so there's

2587.88 --> 2592.52
like some issues with the ship and its

2596.64 --> 2602.16
Personnel also really really

2602.52 --> 2608.4
odd which is super correlator but I mean

2606.4 --> 2612.079
the timing

2608.4 --> 2615.2000000000003
dude I've been watching three body

2612.079 --> 2617.4
problem and I don't want to really spoil

2615.2 --> 2621.2799999999997
things but there's like a

2617.4 --> 2624.7200000000003
scene in the in the later episodes that

2621.28 --> 2627.6800000000003
is like quite brutal where there is a

2624.72 --> 2629.68
giant freighter type

2627.68 --> 2633.359
ship that

2629.68 --> 2633.359
gets totally

2633.68 --> 2640.839
destroyed like in a spectac

2637.68 --> 2646.16
terrifying way that is like a a new

2640.839 --> 2650.44
Hightech thing like some kind of DW type

2646.16 --> 2652.7999999999997
process not lasered not burning but it's

2650.44 --> 2657.839
terrifying and it's like what the [ __ ]

2652.8 --> 2661.6800000000003
was that like I saw

2657.839 --> 2663.96
that like the day before this accident

2661.68 --> 2668.16
happened and I mean three body problem

2663.96 --> 2673.119
has just been released like

2668.16 --> 2673.1189999999997
and a giant freighter just Rams into a

2677.52 --> 2680.839
bridge it's

2686.76 --> 2692.5200000000004
weird I mean in the three body problem

2690.04 --> 2695.7599999999998
the way that frater is destroyed is like

2692.52 --> 2698.319
way more D it is probably one of the

2695.76 --> 2700.96
most dramatic destructions of a

2698.319 --> 2703.5589999999997
freighter you'll ever

2700.96 --> 2707.16
see it on

2703.559 --> 2709.96
film it is like what the hell

2707.16 --> 2714.92
man like seriously you've never seen

2709.96 --> 2714.92
anything like that in any

2715.48 --> 2720.92
video that's as much as I'm going to

2717.48 --> 2720.92
spoil but that was also

2721.319 --> 2725.96
weird but I mean the ship type was

2724.48 --> 2730.04
almost the

2725.96 --> 2734.68
same it kind of looked like the same

2730.04 --> 2738.5589999999997
ship as in the series

2734.68 --> 2738.5589999999997
what it's all just

2746.559 --> 2754.2400000000002
weird where was the ship built no twit

2750.52 --> 2757.72
with it the ship was not it's not a

2754.24 --> 2760.52
super new ship it was an older type ship

2757.72 --> 2762.9199999999996
the the overall build was probably fine

2760.52 --> 2765.24
it's rather the maintenance of it that

2762.92 --> 2767.16
could have had issues and there are

2765.24 --> 2771.319
suspicions that there were

2767.16 --> 2774.72
some diversity High policies involved

2771.319 --> 2777.16
which would include the maintenance yeah

2774.72 --> 2781.839
so that could have been a factor as to

2777.16 --> 2785.5589999999997
its failure instead of like terrorism or

2781.839 --> 2787.72
something sabotage it's so we don't

2785.559 --> 2790.96
really know I I wouldn't blame the

2787.72 --> 2790.9599999999996
architect of the

2802.559 --> 2808.92
ship slide of hand is happening right

2805.04 --> 2811.119
now yeah it's just so many branches of

2808.92 --> 2813.0
different weirdness that are all coming

2811.119 --> 2815.76
together all these loose ends and people

2813.0 --> 2819.96
are like scrambling to try to figure it

2815.76 --> 2819.96
out but so many different

2822.28 --> 2827.96
directions like it's going to be a bit

2825.28 --> 2830.0
complicated to even figure out like uh

2827.96 --> 2831.839
was it really just

2830.0 --> 2833.44
incompetence like structural

2831.839 --> 2837.599
incompetence like maintenance

2833.44 --> 2837.599
incompetence or was there some

2837.839 --> 2844.0
weird like electric

2841.24 --> 2845.839
supression field or something happening

2844.0 --> 2848.0
that turned it all

2845.839 --> 2851.359
off

2848.0 --> 2851.359
like how what was it all

2853.0 --> 2859.96
happening yeah get the [ __ ] out of here

2856.04 --> 2863.2799999999997
don't don't you [ __ ] talk about my my

2859.96 --> 2863.28
wrenches about like that

2863.48 --> 2867.04
[ __ ] get the [ __ ]

2875.839 --> 2881.04
out

2877.52 --> 2883.64
EI generated social out of what the hell

2881.04 --> 2883.64
does that even

2899.28 --> 2905.0400000000004
mean the point is is

2902.119 --> 2908.48
that as far as I'm concerned there is

2905.04 --> 2912.04
still no certainty whether this was just

2908.48 --> 2914.559
an accident because of a Cascade of

2912.04 --> 2918.7599999999998
gross

2914.559 --> 2920.2000000000003
negligence yes or if there is some kind

2918.76 --> 2923.8390000000004
of

2920.2 --> 2928.72
deliberate sabotage or even

2923.839 --> 2928.72
like electric interference

2929.0 --> 2933.48
externally I

2930.88 --> 2935.4
mean it doesn't really seem like it

2933.48 --> 2938.079
because even as the lights on the ship

2935.4 --> 2942.319
go down the lights on the bridge didn't

2938.079 --> 2945.6800000000003
go down so there was probably not a

2942.319 --> 2949.119
electric suppression field type of event

2945.68 --> 2951.52
happening but I I mean the boat is still

2949.119 --> 2953.799
there it's not broken or burned down so

2951.52 --> 2955.599
they could definitely like look into it

2953.799 --> 2958.52
and just see like what the hell happened

2955.599 --> 2960.92
how did the electricity go

2958.52 --> 2964.359
down was there some

2960.92 --> 2967.319
sabotage or was it indeed just a a

2964.359 --> 2970.52
cluster [ __ ] of grow

2967.319 --> 2972.2
negligence and faulty maintenance that

2970.52 --> 2975.2
was the cause of

2972.2 --> 2975.2
this

2977.319 --> 2984.0
right accidents do happen yeah but this

2980.0 --> 2985.119
is kind of over the top though if it was

2984.0 --> 2987.4
an

2985.119 --> 2992.2400000000002
accident

2987.4 --> 2992.2400000000002
like gross negligence very

2993.64 --> 2999.5589999999997
serious right and it could also be

2997.28 --> 3002.0400000000004
gross negligence that's directly at the

2999.559 --> 3006.3590000000004
fault of the management very similar to

3002.04 --> 3010.359
how the the BP oil spill situation

3006.359 --> 3013.5989999999997
happened yeah cuz that was Al also gross

3010.359 --> 3015.72
negligence the management basically said

3013.599 --> 3017.48
no do this even though all the engineers

3015.72 --> 3019.2
said if you do that it'll blow up and

3017.48 --> 3022.4
they're like no you're going to do this

3019.2 --> 3026.359
right now or you're all

3022.4 --> 3028.799
fired like that is it could be something

3026.359 --> 3030.96
like that that although not to that

3028.799 --> 3032.079
scale

3030.96 --> 3034.119
[Music]

3032.079 --> 3037.28
though I

3034.119 --> 3040.2400000000002
mean management can be pretty freaking

3037.28 --> 3040.2400000000002
delusional out

3055.64 --> 3058.64
there

3063.04 --> 3066.88
yes swi I

3068.119 --> 3071.119
know

3074.2 --> 3080.319
well if a phoenix event is going to

3077.839 --> 3083.48
occur then there's a great likelihood

3080.319 --> 3083.48
there will be a a

3084.0 --> 3090.16
gigantic reconstruction event that will

3087.24 --> 3094.0
follow in the the years after or

3090.16 --> 3095.92
hopefully decades after it all depends

3094.0 --> 3098.96
if they did it

3095.92 --> 3101.599
right then they will be able to do that

3098.96 --> 3104.16
and then the United States could take a

3101.599 --> 3107.079
couple of decades to completely

3104.16 --> 3107.0789999999997
Revitalize

3108.64 --> 3112.1189999999997
everything that could

3112.76 --> 3118.8390000000004
happen although to be fair I don't think

3115.96 --> 3121.559
the chances are very high of that as I

3118.839 --> 3123.7599999999998
already said like Phoenix event most

3121.559 --> 3126.48
likely just going to be the new deep

3123.76 --> 3128.5200000000004
State taking over of the old deep State

3126.48 --> 3130.119
well it's still going to be the same

3128.52 --> 3132.24
systems there it's still going to have

3130.119 --> 3135.319
the military-industrial complex it needs

3132.24 --> 3140.72
to keep under control Etc and

3135.319 --> 3140.72
feed like an Ever hungry Beast

3145.52 --> 3148.52
so

3163.24 --> 3169.8799999999997
okay debility that's kind of funny

3167.2 --> 3171.5989999999997
ridiculous but funny but who knows who

3169.88 --> 3174.04
knows if they're even going to build a

3171.599 --> 3176.96
new bridge maybe they're just gonna

3174.04 --> 3178.92
leave it like that and just try to move

3176.96 --> 3181.68
everybody around with

3178.92 --> 3184.16
fairies and

3181.68 --> 3186.5989999999997
just ask

3184.16 --> 3189.799
huge yeah I mean that's going to cost a

3186.599 --> 3192.28
huge amount of money for like all the

3189.799 --> 3193.68
Travelers but like yeah they'll just do

3192.28 --> 3197.3190000000004
that

3193.68 --> 3197.319
perhaps I don't know

3201.64 --> 3207.0789999999997
man we'll see what they'll

3205.44 --> 3211.079
do

3207.079 --> 3211.079
no the eclipse is not the

3211.44 --> 3214.799
cause [ __ ]

3215.359 --> 3220.839
sake it's a Celestial event it's an

3218.2 --> 3224.24
astrological event it doesn't cause

3220.839 --> 3226.4
anything at all it's just

3224.24 --> 3229.3999999999996
correlator and the only thing that it

3226.4 --> 3231.28
does cause is energies energies that

3229.4 --> 3235.4
people pick up

3231.28 --> 3239.3590000000004
on energy that is what celestial events

3235.4 --> 3239.359
do it doesn't cause

3242.28 --> 3249.0
anything why I'm so mad at you because

3244.72 --> 3249.0
you're asking a lot of annoying stupid

3249.559 --> 3255.88
questions anyway I'll be right back I'm

3252.16 --> 3255.8799999999997
going to make my Illuminati

3265.359 --> 3268.359
coffee

3295.319 --> 3298.319
for

3325.319 --> 3328.319
e

3337.16 --> 3344.44
really you saw a car with brand named

3340.799 --> 3344.44
Eclipse cross what the

3345.4 --> 3348.799
hell really

3349.48 --> 3354.599
derer what brand that is

3354.88 --> 3359.6400000000003
bizarre sounds like some some

3357.799 --> 3361.44
industrialist

3359.64 --> 3365.1189999999997
anticipated that

3361.44 --> 3365.119
event that is just

3385.24 --> 3388.24
bizarre

Steve

3397.48 --> 3404.4
Bronson if you don't know the answer to

3414.88 --> 3422.2000000000003
you I mean

3417.96 --> 3425.76
how the hell why would you even ask do

3422.2 --> 3430.5989999999997
you think the eclipse will be the

3425.76 --> 3430.599
cause like what kind of a question is

3435.92 --> 3443.559
that who asks such a question that is

3440.2 --> 3443.5589999999997
just just

3445.16 --> 3448.16
bizarre

3456.16 --> 3461.7599999999998
like some sort of

3458.76 --> 3461.76
triangle

3465.079 --> 3471.32
okay right so it has a triangle logo but

3468.28 --> 3474.489
it's called Eclipse cross is

3471.32 --> 3474.489
[Music]

3475.119 --> 3480.6400000000003

3476.68 --> 3482.1189999999997
mitubishi Eclipse cross holy [ __ ] thank

3480.64 --> 3483.5989999999997
you seeking star where you actually

3482.119 --> 3486.599
found

3483.599 --> 3486.599
it

3489.68 --> 3492.68
wow

3501.319 --> 3508.119
damn I think somebody was just like

3504.28 --> 3508.119
looking for what is the

3509.0 --> 3514.599
like what is the thing now what is the

3510.96 --> 3517.48
thing now oh there's the a big Eclipse

3514.599 --> 3521.48
event okay well just call it Eclipse

3517.48 --> 3524.68
cross Tada I mean they do kind of like

3521.48 --> 3527.92
make decisions pretty rashly like

3524.68 --> 3531.319
that with these types of companies so

3527.92 --> 3531.319
but it's hilarious

3535.039 --> 3538.039
though

3542.359 --> 3547.359
I expected something a little bit more

3544.319 --> 3550.359
than just cars naming them their new

3547.359 --> 3552.7599999999998
cars the car brands naming their new

3550.359 --> 3556.5589999999997
cars after it though that expected a

3552.76 --> 3560.119
little bit more of response but I guess

3556.559 --> 3564.039
that's something something

3560.119 --> 3564.039
weird there's certainly

3565.039 --> 3568.039

3570.319 --> 3575.599
26,000

3571.88 --> 3579.1600000000003
sheep yeah that would a lot of newer

3575.599 --> 3583.88
type of cars can be made really

3579.16 --> 3583.8799999999997
cheap especially if they're still using

3584.76 --> 3592.4
gasoline then they can be made really

3588.44 --> 3595.079
cheap that's the whole advantage of this

3592.4 --> 3597.359
era the cars are going to be made like

3595.079 --> 3602.079
so much cheaper

3597.359 --> 3602.0789999999997

3624.96 --> 3630.52
that

3626.839 --> 3634.96
a crossover vehicle oh yes that explains

3630.52 --> 3637.64
it that's why it's called the eclipse

3634.96 --> 3642.039
cross it's because of something else or

3637.64 --> 3642.0389999999998

dude you guys are just incred you're the

3652.92 --> 3659.039
worst I mean is this just societal

condition doing this to people it's like

3659.039 --> 3666.119
oh something weird that's a weird

3661.96 --> 3668.16
coincidence oh no it has to it's not a

3666.119 --> 3670.1600000000003
coincidence it can't be a coincidence

3668.16 --> 3673.68
there are no

3670.16 --> 3677.319
coincidences it has to be something else

3673.68 --> 3681.52
it can never be some weird synchronicity

3677.319 --> 3684.0
ever like is society just conditioning

3681.52 --> 3686.799
people like you

3684.0 --> 3689.119
guys just to always always have that

3686.799 --> 3691.03

3704.4 --> 3707.52
I'm saying that's kind of

3714.52 --> 3724.079
ridiculous I'm saying that Eclipse

3719.68 --> 3724.0789999999997
cross is not a

3724.319 --> 3727.68
coincidence that's

3733.44 --> 3738.2000000000003
ridiculous I think everything is part no

3736.359 --> 3741.48
that's exactly the [ __ ] I'm talking

3738.2 --> 3741.48
about it's that

3744.839 --> 3749.599
attitude

3747.559 --> 3753.1600000000003
and what do you mean conspiracy it's

3749.599 --> 3756.279
it's a naming Department what a naming

3753.16 --> 3759.24
department is a conspiracy is it or is

3756.279 --> 3761.76
it just the naming Department that like

3759.24 --> 3763.9199999999996
hey there's this really prominent event

3761.76 --> 3766.4
happening everybody's talking about

3763.92 --> 3770.559
there's a lot of people anticipating

3766.4 --> 3774.839
this maybe if we name our new model

3770.559 --> 3776.6400000000003
after that we'll get more

3774.839 --> 3778.88
sales

3776.64 --> 3782.96
oh everything is part of a

3778.88 --> 3786.359
conspiracy like look at you look at you

3782.96 --> 3788.88
saying that can you can you see yourself

3786.359 --> 3788.88
saying

3790.119 --> 3798.7200000000003
that for the last seven years Oh you

3793.119 --> 3804.1600000000003
mean since when the first stripe on the

3798.72 --> 3807.7599999999998
cross was made s years ago yeah s years

3804.16 --> 3811.0389999999998
ago when the first stripe was made on

3807.76 --> 3815.6400000000003
the X which the second stripe is going

3811.039 --> 3815.6400000000003
to be the 8th of April

[Music]

3825.72 --> 3832.68
yeah yeah yeah no people

3829.88 --> 3835.839
actually a lot of people especially

3832.68 --> 3840.2
industrialists especially Bankers they

3835.839 --> 3841.72
they do really pay attention to

3840.2 --> 3845.96
astrological

3841.72 --> 3848.4399999999996
events they do hold them in

3845.96 --> 3850.039
importance unlike you when every

3848.44 --> 3852.599
everything is fake oh it's just

3850.039 --> 3855.5200000000004
ridiculous oh no no it's just a

3852.599 --> 3858.76
coincidence yeah there are no

3855.52 --> 3861.64
coincidences coincidences are for

3858.76 --> 3864.7200000000003
retards that don't have the faculties to

3861.64 --> 3866.24
see the patterns of what is obviously

3864.72 --> 3869.5989999999997
structured

3866.24 --> 3871.52
yeah chaos is for the weak of Mind there

3869.599 --> 3873.319
are no

3871.52 --> 3876.0
coincidences

3873.319 --> 3879.2
coincidence is what you reduce something

3876.0 --> 3882.72
to when you simply can't see the pattern

3879.2 --> 3882.72
of it and that's

3887.0 --> 3890.11
[Music]

3891.279 --> 3897.599
reality and yeah it is really making an

3894.039 --> 3899.559
X I mean it's all on yesterday show twit

3897.599 --> 3902.039
Wht just watch back the first segment of

3899.559 --> 3902.039
yesterday's

3902.119 --> 3907.52
show yeah you got to

3904.68 --> 3909.68
go good you go have an appointment with

3907.52 --> 3909.68
a

3922.079 --> 3929.6800000000003
wall bro I'm thinking that even Elon

3926.359 --> 3932.5989999999997
Musk renamed Twitter to X because of

3929.68 --> 3936.359
this astrological event okay at this

3932.599 --> 3940.599
point yeah that's

3936.359 --> 3943.16
right I think he renamed Twitter

3940.599 --> 3946.88
X in

3943.16 --> 3949.8799999999997
anticipation of this Celestial

3946.88 --> 3949.88

3976.2 --> 3983.2
yeah it's so funny yeah but I mean it's

3980.359 --> 3984.5589999999997
a reoccurring Celestial event that ties

3983.2 --> 3987.1189999999997
in very

3984.559 --> 3991.4
significantly even with the

3987.119 --> 3993.7200000000003
date of the establishment of the United

3991.4 --> 3997.52
States

3993.72 --> 4001.279
7076 you want to know more details about

3997.52 --> 4001.279
that then you have to

4002.76 --> 4009.2000000000003
watch the archaics

4006.359 --> 4012.16
video harbinger of the second seal the

4009.2 --> 4014.52
first part he explains that there is

4012.16 --> 4017.72
that connection yeah it it is all

4014.52 --> 4020.72
ridiculous but that connection is there

4017.72 --> 4023.1189999999997
it is astrologically

4020.72 --> 4027.16
significant very significant and is

4023.119 --> 4031.88
significant to the the

4027.16 --> 4035.2
creation of the post Colonial United

4031.88 --> 4038.4
States it is very significant to that to

4035.2 --> 4039.3999999999996
the creation of the United States you

4038.4 --> 4042.599
could say

4039.4 --> 4045.119
symbolically but it's there it's

4042.599 --> 4049.2400000000002
important to them might not be important

4045.119 --> 4055.079
to you you little dimwitted coincidence

4049.24 --> 4055.0789999999997
Believers yes yeah who think chaos

4062.0 --> 4065.599
exists yeah go watch archaics video

4064.76 --> 4068.599
about

4065.599 --> 4068.599
it

4074.44 --> 4077.44
yeah

4085.4 --> 4090.52
all right I'm going to get my coffee and

4086.799 --> 4090.52
Illuminati I'll be right

4104.44 --> 4107.44
back

4134.44 --> 4137.44
for

4164.359 --> 4167.359

all

4173.58 --> 4180.439
[Music]

4194.32 --> 4197.32

4198.87 --> 4202.0689999999995
[Music]

4204.36 --> 4207.839999999999
you know what x also

4209.76 --> 4213.360000000001
is you know what it

4213.4 --> 4218.08
is besides a

4216.75 --> 4223.6
[Music]

4218.08 --> 4227.92
gift it's also the the Roman numeral for

4223.6 --> 4227.92
10 like the 10

4233.08 --> 4237.76
star no not the Antichrist

4244.51 --> 4251.56
[Music]

4254.239 --> 4257.239
duper

4261.88 --> 4265.88
I don't think Antichrist has a

4267.28 --> 4271.719
number if it is 10 that's pretty

4272.88 --> 4282.159000000001
annoying cuz I think of 10 as the number

4277.84 --> 4282.159000000001
that is really my symbol it's my

4282.52 --> 4287.2390000000005
number it's the one and the zero

4288.159 --> 4292.08
or the

4289.679 --> 4295.12
X

4292.08 --> 4297.0
both but a one and a zero is like the

4295.12 --> 4299.96
perfect representation of the ying and

4297.0 --> 4303.76
the Yang or representation of the the

4299.96 --> 4306.76
two digits it's where the two digits

4303.76 --> 4310.56
start where one digit turns to

4306.76 --> 4312.4800000000005
two to me that's like pattern wise

4310.56 --> 4316.88
extremely

4312.48 --> 4320.239
significant also the 10 even in in

4316.88 --> 4320.2390000000005
grades in

4321.0 --> 4327.0
school I know you guys in the United

4323.4 --> 4333.599999999999
States and all that use uh the

4327.0 --> 4333.6
alphabet but here 10 is like a perfect

4335.76 --> 4344.159000000001
score so yeah 10 the number 10 is to me

4340.96 --> 4347.159
very important

4344.159 --> 4347.159
symbolically

4369.58 --> 4372.63
[Music]

4374.12 --> 4377.12
anyway

4378.239 --> 4386.12
yeah clutch now but it can't be none of

4381.6 --> 4389.400000000001
the X's everywhere and the eclipse cross

4386.12 --> 4392.8
car from seven years ago right after the

4389.4 --> 4396.92
first Mark was made of the celestial

4392.8 --> 4398.92
vent I mean none of that actually has

4396.92 --> 4401.88
anything to

4398.92 --> 4404.28
do with the celestial event that's like

4401.88 --> 4407.32
super significant to the the entire

4404.28 --> 4409.239
creation of the United States from an

4407.32 --> 4411.639
occult perspective of course that has

4409.239 --> 4413.638999999999
nothing to do with it it's all just

4411.639 --> 4417.6
totally random

4413.639 --> 4420.36
coincidences yes it's all just

4417.6 --> 4422.8
random because that's what a Ballard

4420.36 --> 4422.799999999999
thinks

4429.12 --> 4433.679
like yeah it's just all random

4431.719 --> 4437.52
coincidence I mean it's just random

4433.679 --> 4440.88
coincidence that they turn from a amoeba

4437.52 --> 4442.639
to a fish to a lizard to a monkey into a

4440.88 --> 4446.4400000000005
human being it was all just a bunch of

4442.639 --> 4448.639
coincidences right cuz balarts believe

4446.44 --> 4450.239
in coincidences so

4448.639 --> 4453.76
badly

4450.239 --> 4457.5199999999995
that there is no order there is only

4453.76 --> 4457.52
bizarre chaos and random

4463.159 --> 4469.239
coincidence I'm not talking about

4465.84 --> 4473.04

4791.239 --> 4799.879999999999
you Ste could you just stop nagging to

4795.08 --> 4802.0
clutch and hopefully clutch stop nagging

4799.88 --> 4804.159000000001
back a bit which is completely

4802.0 --> 4806.32
understandable cuz he's feeling the same

4804.159 --> 4808.159
thing I am it's just annoying tedious

4806.32 --> 4811.04
you guys are just

4808.159 --> 4813.4
always oh no it's all just a coincidence

4811.04 --> 4815.76
oh no oh it's ridiculous you see a

4813.4 --> 4818.0
conspiracy in

4815.76 --> 4822.280000000001
everything what that a

4818.0 --> 4826.199
car a car brand calls their car the

4822.28 --> 4830.48
eclipse cross starting 7 years ago when

4826.199 --> 4835.719
the first Mark of that cross eclipse

4830.48 --> 4840.12
occurs oh my god oh this can't possibly

4835.719 --> 4843.28
be on purpose it has to be a coincidence

4840.12 --> 4846.84
because car manufacturers always just

4843.28 --> 4849.96
name their cars completely random they

4846.84 --> 4851.76
just say give me a random name

4849.96 --> 4855.52
generator that's what we're going to

4851.76 --> 4859.0
call the new car they never involved any

4855.52 --> 4862.0
astrological significant events or other

4859.0 --> 4865.159
occultism into the naming of their cars

4862.0 --> 4867.679
or anything I mean what car company ever

4865.159 --> 4867.679
does

4868.159 --> 4873.44
that

4870.44 --> 4873.44
yeah

4880.44 --> 4886.36
sure I'm sure it's all just random just

4884.28 --> 4889.5599999999995
random R coincidence just like the

4886.36 --> 4893.5199999999995
random coincidence that allowed the

4889.56 --> 4898.320000000001
evolution the evolution of humanity from

4893.52 --> 4900.280000000001
a single celled organism that somehow

4898.32 --> 4902.32
came out of nothing from a lightning

4900.28 --> 4905.5199999999995
striking a puddle of

4902.32 --> 4909.159
ooze and then it turned into a

4905.52 --> 4910.96
fish and then that turned into a lizard

4909.159 --> 4913.32
and then that turned into a monkey and

4910.96 --> 4916.159
that turned into you it was all just a

4913.32 --> 4918.639
bunch of chaotic random

4916.159 --> 4921.719
coincidences I mean that makes perfect

4918.639 --> 4923.1990000000005
sense right that's logical it's not

4921.719 --> 4926.88
backed by

4923.199 --> 4930.799999999999
anything right but

4926.88 --> 4936.159000000001
people naming things

4930.8 --> 4938.8
products rich people Bankers like using

4936.159 --> 4943.638999999999
astrological events as a

4938.8 --> 4945.360000000001
reference as a point of attention no no

4943.639 --> 4949.0
that never

4945.36 --> 4951.639
happens oh yes no it's but evolution is

4949.0 --> 4955.48
all perfectly logical though right

4951.639 --> 4955.4800000000005
without any proof

4964.4 --> 4970.44
yes yeah and that's see that this is the

4967.28 --> 4973.44
kind of shitty comments

4970.44 --> 4975.799999999999
that that run out of

4973.44 --> 4978.879999999999
that

4975.8 --> 4980.639
aliens it was clearly the aliens

4978.88 --> 4983.08
spreading thisinformation who the [ __ ]

4980.639 --> 4983.08
claims

4984.239 --> 4993.839999999999
aliens hey hey [ __ ] ballart [ __ ] with

4989.12 --> 4996.5199999999995

nonsense cosmology

4996.52 --> 5004.96
yeah there are no

5000.8 --> 5006.8
aliens yeah those things you get to see

5004.96 --> 5011.96
that are called aliens you know where

5006.8 --> 5013.12
they exist on the other side yeah in the

5011.96 --> 5016.76
dream

5013.12 --> 5020.12
world there's Spirit beings not physical

5016.76 --> 5023.92
creatures on another ball of dirt

5020.12 --> 5026.159
endless distances away yeah that's where

5023.92 --> 5026.159
they

5028.199 --> 5034.599999999999
exist but I know it's it's lovely for

5031.08 --> 5037.36
you to point at us and then say Oh alien

5034.6 --> 5039.2390000000005
did cookie conspiracy theorist look at

5037.36 --> 5043.599999999999
who's the cookie conspiracy theorist

5039.239 --> 5043.599999999999

5076.84 --> 5082.88

5089.52 --> 5093.92

live with myself with a bunch of [ __ ]

5115.48 --> 5118.5599999999995
with

5116.679 --> 5121.719
balarts

5177.719 --> 5180.28
my show

5181.28 --> 5186.32
and and please pray for me because I

5184.04 --> 5189.0
just don't know how to live with myself

5186.32 --> 5192.719
with a bunch of [ __ ] with Ballers not

5189.0 --> 5197.04
believing what I say I

5192.719 --> 5201.2390000000005
mean if they don't become convinced that

5197.04 --> 5205.92
Arwin was right about these fundamental

5201.239 --> 5211.199
things then I'm doomed I'm

5205.92 --> 5217.6
doomed so please pray for The Bard

5211.199 --> 5221.159
[ __ ] so that they believe in in

5217.6 --> 5223.719
arianism it has to happen or I want

5221.159 --> 5227.159
survive

5223.719 --> 5231.32
somehow okay that's far

5227.159 --> 5231.32
enough yeah that's

5235.32 --> 5240.119
sarcasm our response is to be more

5237.52 --> 5243.679
condescending

5240.119 --> 5246.839999999999
dude I could take it further I can be

5243.679 --> 5250.1990000000005
even more more condescending yeah what

5246.84 --> 5253.719
you think that that Rabbi smie is the

5250.199 --> 5256.839999999999
only one that can be maniacally

5253.719 --> 5259.4800000000005
condescending no no I can be maniacally

5256.84 --> 5261.96
condescending too and I can take it

5259.48 --> 5263.718999999999
further and further and further and much

5261.96 --> 5266.52
much much

5263.719 --> 5271.28
further until you feel nothing but

5266.52 --> 5271.280000000001
needles in your heart I can do that

5273.119 --> 5277.679
too

5275.119 --> 5279.199
never said you were wrong about anything

5277.679 --> 5280.92
okay well that's fine you're not a

5279.199 --> 5284.5199999999995
baller that's cool steve

5280.92 --> 5284.52
Bronson it's good to

5298.52 --> 5301.52

[ __ ]

5306.07 --> 5309.2
[Music]

5321.08 --> 5324.0
let's alter that

5333.04 --> 5336.04
title

5339.8 --> 5342.2390000000005
ah come

5353.9 --> 5356.92
[Music]

5359.56 --> 5365.119000000001
on yes yes yes yes yes it it fits

5363.6 --> 5367.88
perfectly

5365.119 --> 5370.5599999999995
now right the perception of chaos is

5367.88 --> 5372.28
mental fatigue and misdirection from the

5370.56 --> 5375.2390000000005
devil there you

5372.28 --> 5378.44
go because it is a perception because

5375.239 --> 5382.638999999999
actual chaos is conceptual it doesn't

5378.44 --> 5385.4
exist because everything has order in it

5382.639 --> 5387.76
everything if you can't find the order

5385.4 --> 5391.28
in something that means that

5387.76 --> 5395.08
you're just not looking right because

5391.28 --> 5399.84
there is order in absolutely everything

5395.08 --> 5402.28
the order of the sub of the substantial

5399.84 --> 5403.119000000001
subsequent components of all things at

5402.28 --> 5406.44
every

5403.119 --> 5409.719
order there is order of

5406.44 --> 5412.678999999999
things in order for you to draw the

5409.719 --> 5416.56
false conclusion that there is no order

5412.679 --> 5419.04
and it's all chaos yeah the only way to

5416.56 --> 5422.360000000001
even perceive things is because there

5419.04 --> 5425.28
are levels of order it's all

5422.36 --> 5427.5599999999995
ridiculous there is no chaos chaos is a

5425.28 --> 5430.159
concept that is spawned by the

5427.56 --> 5430.159000000001
weak-minded

5440.6 --> 5445.4800000000005
anyway MIT is also called the car the

5445.76 --> 5452.92
eclipse yeah could be I guess it's a

5449.92 --> 5454.4400000000005
really popular thing why would that be

5452.92 --> 5455.6
why would they just keep calling the

5454.44 --> 5457.879999999999
cars the

5455.6 --> 5463.360000000001
eclipse could it be that they have some

5457.88 --> 5463.36
kind of interest in celestial

5476.159 --> 5481.879999999999
events anyway I'm going to take a bite

5478.6 --> 5485.92
of my Illuminati cons

[Music]

5563.08 --> 5569.88
right guys but I mean if there's going

5566.28 --> 5574.4
to be a phoenix event I'm sure that's

5569.88 --> 5575.88
going to be just a coincidence too right

5574.4 --> 5577.44
and that

5575.88 --> 5580.96
archaics

5577.44 --> 5583.4
called the nin

5580.96 --> 5586.159
Eclipse a phoenix

5583.4 --> 5588.96
event that a phoenix event is related to

5586.159 --> 5592.5599999999995
that completely separate from

5588.96 --> 5595.4
me yeah he made that video even before I

5592.56 --> 5597.8
called it I didn't even know he

5595.4 --> 5600.0
existed but I'm sure it's all just a

5597.8 --> 5603.52
coincidence that several different

5600.0 --> 5605.96
people just start to figure out the same

5603.52 --> 5608.320000000001
thing start to see the same

5605.96 --> 5611.119
patterns just completely separate from

5608.32 --> 5614.679
each other I'm sure it's all just a

5611.119 --> 5614.679
coincidence it's a

5620.98 --> 5624.049999999999
[Music]

5632.719 --> 5635.719
coincidence

5647.29 --> 5653.96
[Music]

5649.44 --> 5653.96
I love the smell of a coincidence in the

5659.679 --> 5662.679
morning

5662.719 --> 5666.84
right

5664.639 --> 5669.4800000000005
cuz that sun coming up in the morning I

5666.84 --> 5673.88
mean that's also a

5669.48 --> 5675.839999999999
coincidence because you could argue that

5673.88 --> 5677.679
it's just a coincidence that it comes up

5675.84 --> 5679.159000000001
every morning because one day it might

5677.679 --> 5683.52
just not come

5679.159 --> 5683.5199999999995
up so it's arguably a

5686.36 --> 5691.48
coincidence right it's just a

5688.199 --> 5695.4
coincidence that we just happen to be on

5691.48 --> 5698.48
a ball of dirt in an endless

5695.4 --> 5699.719
vacuum and we're just flying around this

5698.48 --> 5702.959999999999
fiery

5699.719 --> 5705.44
ball in this very specific cyclical

5702.96 --> 5708.719
pattern and it's just a coincidence it's

5705.44 --> 5711.44
just a coincidence yeah something could

5708.719 --> 5714.4
just suddenly shift something or a

5711.44 --> 5718.08
meteor hits us from the

5714.4 --> 5721.44
outside or the the Sun goes into like a

5718.08 --> 5724.239
super nova or something and then oh it's

5721.44 --> 5726.599999999999
just it's all just a coincidence

5724.239 --> 5726.599999999999
the

5752.639 --> 5755.639
coincidence

5756.239 --> 5759.5199999999995
there's no coincidence with the car good

5758.08 --> 5762.5599999999995
good to you Steve

5759.52 --> 5765.56
Bronson it's all

5762.56 --> 5767.400000000001
right I'm acting a bit weird today don't

5765.56 --> 5770.04
take it all super

5767.4 --> 5772.4
personal I probably shouldn't have watch

5770.04 --> 5775.04
the whole schoie interview yesterday

5772.4 --> 5778.32
with Alex nonstop from beginning to end

5775.04 --> 5778.32
that did kind of drive me

5780.639 --> 5785.56
insane anybody that's seen it

5812.52 --> 5815.52
nose

5827.0 --> 5833.88
the should be upheld in humanity oh

5829.679 --> 5833.88
thank you dwit I appreciate

5841.08 --> 5847.76
that unless they just talk

5844.4 --> 5847.759999999999
Perpetual nonsense

5847.84 --> 5853.0
though but then again people will still

5850.44 --> 5853.0
uphold

5854.04 --> 5860.5199999999995
that but these days a real theorist

5857.48 --> 5860.5199999999995
seems to be a

5860.84 --> 5866.639
person who

5862.88 --> 5870.4400000000005
presupposes disproven nonsense and then

5866.639 --> 5870.4400000000005
elaborates on the disproven

5871.96 --> 5877.679
nonsense and those

5874.199 --> 5877.678999999999
get endless

5879.8 --> 5887.84
praise and people trying to point out

5884.56 --> 5891.8
that it is based on disproven nonsense

5887.84 --> 5891.8
well they get shunned they're the bad

5892.56 --> 5897.92
people right and I know a lot of you

5895.159 --> 5900.239
[ __ ] wits in the chat right now are like

5897.92 --> 5902.04
screaming on the inside AR you're

5900.239 --> 5903.919999999999
projecting that's exactly what we're

5902.04 --> 5908.119
doing we're trying to find it's your

5903.92 --> 5910.32
disproven nonsense it's all disproven

5908.119 --> 5913.719
nonsense I know I know that's what

5910.32 --> 5917.759999999999
you're feeling I can't help you with

5913.719 --> 5917.76
that yeah you're just

5918.32 --> 5923.32
stuck you're stuck on the other side and

5921.28 --> 5927.239
once you get stuck there then everything

5923.32 --> 5929.44
flips inside out and it's like a perfect

5927.239 --> 5932.678999999999
mirror it's a perfect

5929.44 --> 5934.36
mirror when you're stuck in the exact

5932.679 --> 5937.96
opposite

5934.36 --> 5941.08
what I do then everything you see me do

5937.96 --> 5944.599
is like the perfect hypocrisy in every

5941.08 --> 5948.5199999999995
way but that perception is actually a

5944.599 --> 5952.1990000000005
perfect projection from your side that

5948.52 --> 5952.1990000000005
you are unwilling to

5954.0 --> 5960.159
see because when the light shines too

5958.119 --> 5962.36
bright for the

5960.159 --> 5966.119
darkness to

5962.36 --> 5971.44
absorb then everything becomes a

5966.119 --> 5971.44
projection which projection is like a

5971.88 --> 5977.04
deflection that's what projection is

5974.04 --> 5980.719
it's a deflection it deflects the

5977.04 --> 5980.719
incoming information

5981.679 --> 5987.599
perfectly that's what a projection

5984.639 --> 5991.0
is because if you project it then you

5987.599 --> 5992.08
deflect it fully and then none of the

5991.0 --> 5995.48
actual

5992.08 --> 5997.76
information will sink in it will all be

5995.48 --> 6001.119
deflected and that's the only way you

5997.76 --> 6002.76
can maintain your perfectly reversed

6001.119 --> 6006.839999999999
World

6002.76 --> 6009.599
position in the face of what I

6006.84 --> 6012.400000000001
say so I very much understand if you're

6009.599 --> 6014.2390000000005
all like boiling up on the inside

6012.4 --> 6016.119
thinking like oh my God he's such a

6014.239 --> 6018.4
hypocrite everything he's saying is

6016.119 --> 6021.32
exactly what he's what he is

6018.4 --> 6025.92
doing yeah that's because you're

6021.32 --> 6025.92
projecting and not I am I'm not

6028.679 --> 6032.08
projecting yeah have a great weekend

6030.48 --> 6035.04
sweet withit thanks for being there it's

6032.08 --> 6035.04
good it's good to see

6040.48 --> 6043.5199999999995
[Music]

6050.15 --> 6055.239
[Music]

6052.239 --> 6055.239
You'

6064.159 --> 6068.199
you see chaos

6065.84 --> 6069.159000000001
theorists have literally no ground to

6068.199 --> 6072.48
stand

6069.159 --> 6074.598999999999
on if you find a pattern in something

6072.48 --> 6077.28
that explains chaos

6074.599 --> 6081.1990000000005
then you undo

6077.28 --> 6084.96
yourself because chaos is the lack of

6081.199 --> 6087.638999999999
pattern so chaos theory is literally

6084.96 --> 6087.639
self-defeating

6102.36 --> 6108.96
and if

6105.44 --> 6111.839999999999
something has a pattern that you don't

6108.96 --> 6113.84
think is

6111.84 --> 6118.119000000001
relevant it's like oh it's just

6113.84 --> 6118.119000000001
coincidental pattern

6118.52 --> 6124.84
maybe it is probably not relevant to the

6122.4 --> 6126.638999999999
context of your Vantage Point of

6124.84 --> 6128.96
approach of the

6126.639 --> 6131.119
situation but is that the only thing

6128.96 --> 6133.52
that exist your your vantage point of

6131.119 --> 6137.44
the approach of the situation or are

6133.52 --> 6140.56
there a whole fractal Cascade of other

6137.44 --> 6144.5599999999995
things that involve themselves despite

6140.56 --> 6147.2390000000005
your narrowed attentions man your narrow

6144.56 --> 6149.84
focus of the

6147.239 --> 6153.08
situation do you not give recognition

6149.84 --> 6156.2390000000005
that things exist in fractal fashion

6153.08 --> 6156.239
outside of your own

6158.52 --> 6163.719
Consciousness CU that would be kind of

6160.56 --> 6163.719
solipsistic in a

6165.119 --> 6171.119
way as soon as you recognize that things

6168.28 --> 6173.88
exist outside of

6171.119 --> 6176.04
you outside of your

6173.88 --> 6179.639
Consciousness then you realize that

6176.04 --> 6184.08
chaos doesn't exist and it can't

6179.639 --> 6184.08
exist chaos is merely a

6192.25 --> 6195.42
[Music]

6198.64 --> 6201.839
[Music]

6202.119 --> 6205.119
perception

6205.92 --> 6209.01
[Music]

6227.599 --> 6232.04
a projection was attributing personal

6229.76 --> 6234.56
issue into someone

6232.04 --> 6237.679
else's

6234.56 --> 6237.679
now projection

6240.159 --> 6249.598999999999
is accuse technically as a communication

6245.84 --> 6252.679
form projection is accusing your

6249.599 --> 6254.92
opponent of what you do

6252.679 --> 6257.32
yourself that's a very typical

6254.92 --> 6261.0
application that is being used a lot out

6257.32 --> 6264.5199999999995
there it's like a political strategy a

6261.0 --> 6266.56
Marxist political strategy

6264.52 --> 6269.119000000001
you attack the opponent by accusing them

6266.56 --> 6269.119000000001
of what you're

6269.679 --> 6276.52
doing and to do that is like to First it

6274.28 --> 6279.599
so that you're pointing it

6276.52 --> 6282.159000000001
out and projecting it onto the opponent

6279.599 --> 6283.96
before they get a chance to point out

6282.159 --> 6287.759999999999
that that is what you're

6283.96 --> 6290.56
doing so they had the first go at

6287.76 --> 6292.280000000001
it right but yes I know that's what your

6290.56 --> 6295.0
post said you had that technically

6292.28 --> 6296.44
correct but projection also just happens

6295.0 --> 6298.719
in the

6296.44 --> 6301.0
mind when there's something that you

6298.719 --> 6301.0
can't

6301.88 --> 6309.679
handle and you're in direct opposition

6306.159 --> 6311.799999999999
for some personal reason

6309.679 --> 6315.76
philosophically

6311.8 --> 6319.679
then it's very easy to see what the

6315.76 --> 6324.679
person is describing in detail as a form

6319.679 --> 6327.4
of projection from their vantage point

6324.679 --> 6330.92
in the perception of your Vantage Point

6327.4 --> 6330.92
and that's a very typical thing that

6331.0 --> 6338.36
happens yeah when you're polarized to a

6335.36 --> 6341.5199999999995
like a very fine

6338.36 --> 6344.5199999999995
degree into exact opposites then

6341.52 --> 6347.679
whatever the opponent does you'll just

6344.52 --> 6349.0
immediately see it logically that's the

6347.679 --> 6351.2390000000005
craziest thing it's not just an

6349.0 --> 6354.92
assumption you see it you start to see

6351.239 --> 6354.919999999999
it logically as

6354.96 --> 6361.0
[Music]

6359.0 --> 6364.199
projection and that's the weird thing

6361.0 --> 6369.239
about projection too is

6364.199 --> 6370.638999999999
that projection may happen with a person

6369.239 --> 6373.44
but

6370.639 --> 6376.96
often they're not even aware that they

6373.44 --> 6376.96
are projecting when they do

6378.199 --> 6384.04
it that is very typical that people do

6381.0 --> 6386.239
project and not realize it

6384.04 --> 6390.119
[Music]

6386.239 --> 6392.959999999999
but then their opponents will think that

6390.119 --> 6396.679
they're doing it on

6392.96 --> 6398.8
purpose but it is a perception issue at

6396.679 --> 6402.4400000000005
it it's very bizarre how that works it's

6398.8 --> 6405.679
like it's the chemistry of the

6402.44 --> 6408.239
Consciousness in a polarized

6405.679 --> 6410.8
scenario and it

6408.239 --> 6414.44
happens it happens a lot it even

6410.8 --> 6416.1990000000005
happened a lot like but in like when I

6414.44 --> 6418.879999999999
was at the Flat Earth

6416.199 --> 6421.919999999999
debates and when we would go at an anti

6418.88 --> 6425.4800000000005
flat earther and they would go at

6421.92 --> 6429.84
us continual seeing of the projection of

6425.48 --> 6432.28
the other side and then just like

6429.84 --> 6435.719
assuming that's what they intend to do

6432.28 --> 6439.239
but they don't perceive it they don't

6435.719 --> 6441.52
perceive that they are

6439.239 --> 6443.959999999999
projecting because from their vantage

6441.52 --> 6447.280000000001
point it is all very very reasonable and

6443.96 --> 6449.679
they don't see how what they're accusing

6447.28 --> 6453.04
the opponent of is what they are doing

6449.679 --> 6456.8
they can't see that they don't judge

6453.04 --> 6459.239
their own actions like that and that is

6456.8 --> 6460.92
just a fascinating thing in general

6459.239 --> 6464.839999999999
wouldn't you

6460.92 --> 6467.52
say it's really a conundrum of the

6464.84 --> 6470.96
Consciousness if you have Consciousness

6467.52 --> 6474.52
in polarized opposition to one another

6470.96 --> 6477.639
then the perception of projection from

6474.52 --> 6480.84
the other side will dramatically

6477.639 --> 6481.679
increase will try to force itself upon

6480.84 --> 6485.2390000000005
your

6481.679 --> 6487.4
perception you will see how the other is

6485.239 --> 6490.919999999999
projection projecting you will be able

6487.4 --> 6494.119
to argue how the other is projecting yet

6490.92 --> 6496.92
the one you're telling you're accusing

6494.119 --> 6499.36
of projecting with what they're saying

6496.92 --> 6501.8
they can't see that and they certainly

6499.36 --> 6504.28
didn't consciously intend to a lot of

6501.8 --> 6506.28
the time

6504.28 --> 6508.719
although when

6506.28 --> 6512.28
analyzed it could be argued that they

6508.719 --> 6515.679
are projecting and this is really

6512.28 --> 6519.159
interesting this is like an interesting

6515.679 --> 6521.1990000000005
side effect of the Consciousness in a

6519.159 --> 6523.679
polarized scenario against another

6521.199 --> 6525.719
Consciousness it's like a natural thing

6523.679 --> 6527.56
that just starts to happen it's

6525.719 --> 6531.719
fascinating how it

6527.56 --> 6533.56
works and it is also probably a big

6531.719 --> 6535.4
part

6533.56 --> 6538.679
of what

6535.4 --> 6541.239
causes people that are in

6538.679 --> 6543.119
polarized scenarios against one another

6541.239 --> 6546.919999999999
philosophically or

6543.119 --> 6550.5199999999995
whatever to not be able to come to an

6546.92 --> 6553.36
agreement because they just keep seeing

6550.52 --> 6557.360000000001
how the other is projecting and taking

6553.36 --> 6561.5599999999995
that projection as a conscious

6557.36 --> 6563.48
decision which it usually isn't and that

6561.56 --> 6567.04
prevents the the

6563.48 --> 6569.44
forgiveness and the coming closer to an

6567.04 --> 6570.8
understanding it keeps the polarized

6569.44 --> 6574.32
situation

6570.8 --> 6576.96
polarized this might even be what is at

6574.32 --> 6580.5199999999995
the root cause of

6576.96 --> 6583.599
feuds between say families or mafia

6580.52 --> 6586.8
families or whatever opposing groups to

6583.599 --> 6590.28
keep lingering for so

6586.8 --> 6594.56
long because of this psychological side

6590.28 --> 6597.88
effect that you just start to see

6594.56 --> 6599.320000000001
naturally this is not a construct this

6597.88 --> 6601.159000000001
is not something that people

6599.32 --> 6605.719
artificially have to build it just

6601.159 --> 6609.799999999999
happens naturally you start to see the

6605.719 --> 6612.159
projection of the opp the opposing

6609.8 --> 6615.52
Factor even though they are not

6612.159 --> 6619.5199999999995
consciously seeing it

6615.52 --> 6619.52
so it's interesting isn't

6621.639 --> 6626.88
it

6623.71 --> 6626.88
[Music]

6628.36 --> 6634.839999999999
there side effect their side effect

6631.76 --> 6638.96
to the

6634.84 --> 6638.96
Consciousness perceiving and

6639.76 --> 6645.159000000001
analyzing Communications coming out of

6642.36 --> 6646.679
another Consciousness that is in a

6645.159 --> 6649.0
polarized

6646.679 --> 6650.96
opposition

6649.0 --> 6654.44
position to

6650.96 --> 6656.88
yours philosophic or argumentatively

6654.44 --> 6658.199
there that's that's a thing it's a thing

6656.88 --> 6660.8
that happens

6658.199 --> 6663.638999999999
naturally and it's very logical that

6660.8 --> 6667.88
when you start to perceive that you will

6663.639 --> 6670.92
have ideas that it is all on purpose

6667.88 --> 6672.92
that they're scheming against you with

6670.92 --> 6675.84
their

6672.92 --> 6678.4800000000005
projections but there's no actual

6675.84 --> 6681.679
tangible evidence for this a lot of the

6678.48 --> 6683.678999999999
time you might be able to test it though

6681.679 --> 6686.159
you might be if you're really wise

6683.679 --> 6689.159
really good with your subtle

6686.159 --> 6692.92
Communications and reading emotions then

6689.159 --> 6696.5599999999995
you can test the opponent whether they

6692.92 --> 6700.0
are consciously projecting onto the onto

6696.56 --> 6702.679
you or your their opponents or whether

6700.0 --> 6705.52
it is just coincidental they're not

6702.679 --> 6708.4800000000005
conscious of doing it it just happens

6705.52 --> 6712.079000000001
what I'm saying is it naturally

6708.48 --> 6713.718999999999
happens it naturally happens when a

6712.079 --> 6715.84
conscious

6713.719 --> 6718.2390000000005
is in polar opposition to another

6715.84 --> 6721.32
conscious within a philosophy or

6718.239 --> 6726.0
argument then the perception of

6721.32 --> 6728.96
projection starts to naturally occur and

6726.0 --> 6731.76
become argument you can argument it you

6728.96 --> 6734.32
can then build evidence for it even

6731.76 --> 6737.52
though the opposing Consciousness a lot

6734.32 --> 6740.199
of the times cannot be proven to

6737.52 --> 6745.0
actually be aware of it this is a

6740.199 --> 6745.0
naturally occurring psychologic IAL

6748.8 --> 6756.079000000001
phenomenon and I've been aware of it for

6751.199 --> 6756.079
quite some time and now I'm naming

6760.119 --> 6764.5599999999995
it and I am convinced that this

6762.719 --> 6769.04
naturally occurring psychological

6764.56 --> 6773.04
phenomenon is also what keeps

6769.04 --> 6775.28
feuds polarized against one another and

6773.04 --> 6778.84
make them

6775.28 --> 6782.8
last it is also a logical reason why

6778.84 --> 6783.679
Jesus his teachings are the resolution

6782.8 --> 6786.639
to

6783.679 --> 6787.88
it why you shouldn't why you should

6786.639 --> 6790.8
forgive your

6787.88 --> 6791.76
enemies you're going to perceive them as

6790.8 --> 6793.52
being

6791.76 --> 6796.76
more

6793.52 --> 6799.719
malicious and scheming against you than

6796.76 --> 6802.52
they might actually be and there's no

6799.719 --> 6804.36
way to break that perception other than

6802.52 --> 6806.88
to lay it

6804.36 --> 6810.96
down and

6806.88 --> 6814.400000000001
forgive as Jesus teaches and that breaks

6810.96 --> 6814.4
the cycle of

6816.28 --> 6821.96
polarization did you expect the

6818.239 --> 6821.959999999999
conversation to move towards

6822.079 --> 6826.719999999999
this I

6823.54 --> 6826.72
[Music]

6831.44 --> 6834.44
didn't

6853.0 --> 6858.48
right and here's another factor to it as

6855.28 --> 6862.4
well and that is that real

6858.48 --> 6865.28
projection is more likely to be a sub

6862.4 --> 6869.799999999999
conscious process because if you would

6865.28 --> 6874.44
be consciously aware of your actions of

6869.8 --> 6877.84
projection it would unnerve you because

6874.44 --> 6881.5599999999995
it's like a scary

6877.84 --> 6885.0
hypocrisy if you're aware that you are

6881.56 --> 6888.4400000000005
actively committing a projection like

6885.0 --> 6888.44
that that is

6888.599 --> 6894.400000000001
unnerving it's like being conscious of

6891.84 --> 6897.2390000000005
that that is what is effectively

6894.4 --> 6900.5199999999995
happening would

6897.239 --> 6903.199
disrupt the flow of it because naturally

6900.52 --> 6907.159000000001
if we're aware of it we don't want to be

6903.199 --> 6911.119
caught doing something that is that

6907.159 --> 6913.879999999999
hypocritical the awareness of a

6911.119 --> 6917.32
projection being engaged

6913.88 --> 6921.079
with is very likely in the moment of

6917.32 --> 6923.239
awareness to disrupt the process of that

6921.079 --> 6925.4
projection because because naturally we

6923.239 --> 6928.839999999999
don't want to be caught in such a level

6925.4 --> 6933.0
of hypocrisy like to be seen by God

6928.84 --> 6933.0
consciously doing that is

6933.92 --> 6939.88
scary on a subconscious level like it's

6937.56 --> 6942.639
scary once you realize that that is what

6939.88 --> 6942.639
you're doing it's

6943.84 --> 6950.84
scary so with all the projection that is

6948.599 --> 6953.56
happening out there in the world

6950.84 --> 6956.32
measurably we can only conclude that it

6953.56 --> 6961.92
is the polarization

6956.32 --> 6961.92
itself that causes the perception of

6962.04 --> 6967.32
projection

6963.92 --> 6970.599
naturally without the conscious of the

6967.32 --> 6974.04
polarized opposition being consciously

6970.599 --> 6977.04
aware of it because the awareness of the

6974.04 --> 6979.239
projection would disrupt the process of

6977.04 --> 6979.239
the

6980.76 --> 6986.09
projection what do you think

6982.91 --> 6986.09
[Music]

6998.32 --> 7002.36
isn't this interesting just dug up

7001.04 --> 7005.8
another

7002.36 --> 7008.679
gem I don't know how I even managed this

7005.8 --> 7010.159000000001
it just happens I just I just figure it

7008.679 --> 7012.88
out all of a

7010.159 --> 7017.96
sudden like this is really interesting

7012.88 --> 7020.96
this is like very tangible very useful

7017.96 --> 7023.44
information and I even got the resolve I

7020.96 --> 7026.76
mean this even explains Jesus

7023.44 --> 7030.719
methodology it even explains it it fits

7026.76 --> 7034.280000000001
this is amazing this is amazing gravy as

7030.719 --> 7038.76
Owen would say it I basically figured

7034.28 --> 7038.759999999999
out the mystery of perceived

7040.4 --> 7046.92
projection this is amazing

7043.719 --> 7052.159
I am really impressed if I say so

7046.92 --> 7052.159
myself it just all fit in

7056.32 --> 7062.159
place yeah there is no

7059.079 --> 7065.239
chaos chaos is mental

7062.159 --> 7068.839999999999
fatigue you don't see the pattern you

7065.239 --> 7074.119
just see chaos you can't see the

7068.84 --> 7074.119000000001
connection but if your mental fatigue is

7074.32 --> 7080.28
discarded or you

7076.44 --> 7083.28
accept that there has to be order then

7080.28 --> 7088.239
at some point that order may be revealed

7083.28 --> 7091.88
to you as it just did to me live in the

7088.239 --> 7095.049999999999
moment without any anticipation of

7091.88 --> 7095.05
[Music]

7101.119 --> 7104.119
it

7113.679 --> 7118.4800000000005
that's that's a very wise saying by the

7115.36 --> 7120.799999999999
way Steve Bronson yes we do hate our own

7118.48 --> 7122.959999999999
flaws and when you hate your own flaws

7120.8 --> 7125.2390000000005
you start to see those flaws in

7122.96 --> 7127.56
others and that's where your attention

7125.239 --> 7127.5599999999995
will be

7128.679 --> 7135.0
drawn that's a good

7131.04 --> 7135.0
point I'm glad you're still with

7136.48 --> 7141.159
us hello Turquoise Dragon good to see

7156.88 --> 7159.939
[Music]

7161.04 --> 7164.04
you

7165.1 --> 7171.88
[Music]

7172.04 --> 7177.5199999999995
so realize

7174.119 --> 7181.48
that the perception of

7177.52 --> 7185.96
projection is a natural side

7181.48 --> 7185.959999999999
effect of being within a

7186.84 --> 7192.92
polarized argumentative condition you're

7190.36 --> 7194.32
in with another consciousness you have

7192.92 --> 7197.56
an

7194.32 --> 7199.639
opposition within the argument that's

7197.56 --> 7202.320000000001
rooted especially if it's rooted deeply

7199.639 --> 7204.88
if it's like has to do with philosophy

7202.32 --> 7207.199
itself then it is only natural that

7204.88 --> 7209.159000000001
you'll start to

7207.199 --> 7213.0
see

7209.159 --> 7216.32
projection in what the opponent

7213.0 --> 7218.76
does that's a natural

7216.32 --> 7220.32
occurrence but even if you would point

7218.76 --> 7223.639
it

7220.32 --> 7225.599
out you should be able to see telltale

7223.639 --> 7227.52
signs from the response of pointing it

7225.599 --> 7229.8
out from the opponent whether that is

7227.52 --> 7231.56
real or not or whether they're like what

7229.8 --> 7235.88
what are you talking

7231.56 --> 7239.4400000000005
about like because actual

7235.88 --> 7243.04
projection is a highly hypocritical

7239.44 --> 7246.199
action that the

7243.04 --> 7247.96
Consciousness won't just gradually

7246.199 --> 7250.32
casually

7247.96 --> 7253.44
apply because it's very punishing so

7250.32 --> 7258.32
there must be a really really good

7253.44 --> 7261.239
reason to commit such a well sin

7258.32 --> 7263.88
consciously knowingly

7261.239 --> 7269.32
projecting can definitely be argued to

7263.88 --> 7273.159000000001
be a sin against God a very brutal level

7269.32 --> 7278.36
lie so to just casually automatically do

7273.159 --> 7278.36
it with the Consciousness should be very

7280.92 --> 7283.92
rare

7298.76 --> 7302.679
our reflection is what we try to

7303.4 --> 7309.159
avoid well it is the realization the

7306.679 --> 7313.0
consciousness of something knowing what

7309.159 --> 7315.638999999999
you do is when an act

7313.0 --> 7315.639
turns

7315.679 --> 7322.28
from unconscious autopilot

7319.079 --> 7328.04
Behavior or railroad Behavior default

7322.28 --> 7332.0
Behavior to a potential sin right sin

7328.04 --> 7333.88
against God requires conscious knowledge

7332.0 --> 7336.119
of what it is you're

7333.88 --> 7338.96
doing if you don't realize what you're

7336.119 --> 7341.679
doing then you can't commit a

7338.96 --> 7344.599
sin it's only when you know you're doing

7341.679 --> 7348.88
it that God's ey start staring you in

7344.599 --> 7352.8
the face basically like telling you like

7348.88 --> 7355.28
yeah you're committing a sin right

7352.8 --> 7361.4400000000005
now that's going to cost

7355.28 --> 7361.44
you and that's what people naturally

7361.679 --> 7369.4400000000005
avoid unless they're like

7364.76 --> 7374.4400000000005
really crazy or self-loathing and like

7369.44 --> 7374.44
willing to seek out destruction of

7393.679 --> 7397.8
themselves yeah don't worry about it

7395.599 --> 7400.4400000000005
clutch and don't worry about it Steve we

7397.8 --> 7404.320000000001
were all in a heated situation we were

7400.44 --> 7407.598999999999
Bas you guys clutch and me and Steve

7404.32 --> 7413.04
Ronson and the others out there we were

7407.599 --> 7413.04
finding ourselves in a polarized

7414.48 --> 7419.598999999999
argument

7416.88 --> 7422.0
right and when you find yourself in a

7419.599 --> 7423.8
polarized argument where one group is

7422.0 --> 7428.28
going to take one vantage point that

7423.8 --> 7430.84
directly opposes the other Vantage Point

7428.28 --> 7432.4
[ __ ] is going to happen and it's very

7430.84 --> 7435.079
hard to break out of it

7432.4 --> 7437.4
you're going to see negative

7435.079 --> 7441.199
intent

7437.4 --> 7443.48
and deception and Mis

7441.199 --> 7445.5199999999995
Direction in the other side and you're

7443.48 --> 7449.44
going to see it like they did it on

7445.52 --> 7452.040000000001
purpose this is a natural

7449.44 --> 7455.678999999999
occurence it's a natural side effect of

7452.04 --> 7455.679
the polarization within an

7455.84 --> 7461.76
argument but it's good if you afterward

7459.599 --> 7464.88
can realize that and and realize that

7461.76 --> 7469.1990000000005
like w maybe I pushed it a bit too far

7464.88 --> 7469.1990000000005
that's great that's the

7470.52 --> 7478.0
resolution or depolarization if you will

7474.199 --> 7480.4
and depolarization is exactly what Jesus

7478.0 --> 7480.4
is all

7490.639 --> 7495.899
about

7492.75 --> 7495.899
[Music]

7499.5 --> 7507.279
[Music]

7507.559 --> 7513.079000000001
hey thanks Phil yeah thank you I'm very

7510.84 --> 7514.0
happy about I did not expect that the

7513.079 --> 7517.599
show

7514.0 --> 7517.599
would become like

7520.639 --> 7525.599
this

7523.079 --> 7527.639
was like a lot of chaos and but

7525.599 --> 7531.0
apparently it just wrestle with the

7527.639 --> 7532.639
chaos and let it all happen and go back

7531.0 --> 7534.52
and forth and start pointing at

7532.639 --> 7537.679
psychological behavior and all of a

7534.52 --> 7539.4400000000005
sudden like holy [ __ ] I see order like

7537.679 --> 7541.88
I'm seeing what's happening I'm seeing

7539.44 --> 7545.159
the patterns I'm seeing like this

7541.88 --> 7548.28
projection thing and how that just I

7545.159 --> 7552.079
start to see the the spiritual metadata

7548.28 --> 7554.32
side this yeah the esoterics the

7552.079 --> 7557.079
psychological

7554.32 --> 7560.4
esoterics I'm just seeing

7557.079 --> 7564.84
it and I've been able to explain it and

7560.4 --> 7568.4
that's is yeah very interesting and

7564.84 --> 7571.04
definitely like worth watching

7568.4 --> 7575.839999999999
back I'm going to definitely download

7571.04 --> 7579.32
this show and watch back how I explained

7575.84 --> 7582.719
it and maybe tomorrow tomorrow show will

7579.32 --> 7586.0
have a title that directly reflects that

7582.719 --> 7586.0
the whole issue with

7598.559 --> 7605.84
projection this agreement has been

7601.44 --> 7608.678999999999
missing wow little alot uh seems like

7605.84 --> 7608.679
you didn't get

7610.52 --> 7613.52
it

7614.4 --> 7620.48
no it's not disagree like to say that

7618.48 --> 7624.159
you you apparently don't really

7620.48 --> 7626.799999999999
understand the the significance of these

7624.159 --> 7628.44
words yeah it's not disagreement that is

7626.8 --> 7631.159000000001
a sin it

7628.44 --> 7633.48
is

7631.159 --> 7637.0
misdirection which is includes

7633.48 --> 7637.0
projection that is a sin

7637.48 --> 7644.839999999999
knowingly lying basically misdirecting

7641.96 --> 7650.32
being conscious of it

7644.84 --> 7650.32
brings the eye of God on

7651.599 --> 7655.599
you and that comes with a

7656.04 --> 7661.96
price but if you're not consciously

7659.32 --> 7665.0
aware that that is what you're doing

7661.96 --> 7668.679
then it isn't a sin it is

7665.0 --> 7671.48
just natural behavior that is a

7668.679 --> 7673.52
responsive that is an autopilot is basic

7671.48 --> 7675.598999999999
basically without the Consciousness the

7673.52 --> 7678.079000000001
subconsciousness delivers you the

7675.599 --> 7680.360000000001
materials to respond but the

7678.079 --> 7684.88
Consciousness doesn't

7680.36 --> 7687.639
see the patterns of it in order for you

7684.88 --> 7690.119
to become aware that it is a sin that

7687.639 --> 7690.119
you're

7693.119 --> 7700.5199999999995
committing oh oh you disagree oh oh

7696.84 --> 7703.4400000000005
you're still insulted are you oh I'm so

7700.52 --> 7703.4400000000005
sorry

7705.079 --> 7711.239
I'm so sorry that you you couldn't enjoy

7708.239 --> 7714.32
the glory of these

7711.239 --> 7716.839999999999
insights and you took the C to now like

7714.32 --> 7718.96
now it's my turn now you're going to get

7716.84 --> 7720.1990000000005
it out dare you I dare you say these

7718.96 --> 7723.76
things about

7720.199 --> 7726.638999999999
me I'm sorry L

7723.76 --> 7728.360000000001
Alcott not really sorry I'm I'm sorry

7726.639 --> 7731.84
that you're taking this

7728.36 --> 7733.88
position I'm sorry that the glory of

7731.84 --> 7737.079
these insights are lost to you that's

7733.88 --> 7741.599
what I'm sorry about I'm very sorry for

7737.079 --> 7741.599
you not sorry for what I said or

7749.559 --> 7759.92
did guess not all

7752.8 --> 7759.92
are are meant to take the value of this

7760.36 --> 7763.36
insight

7767.57 --> 7770.759999999999
[Music]

7785.53 --> 7793.32
[Music]

7790.32 --> 7793.32
okay

7794.719 --> 7798.52
but at this point you really consider

7796.96 --> 7801.32
that it's kind of a miracle that I

7798.52 --> 7805.4800000000005
haven't kicked you out

7801.32 --> 7808.799999999999
yet with your overall

7805.48 --> 7811.28
attitude and your projection your

7808.8 --> 7812.76
continual scatter gunning projection

7811.28 --> 7815.92
about

7812.76 --> 7818.159000000001
condescending all that it's exactly what

7815.92 --> 7818.159
you're

7818.559 --> 7824.159000000001
doing I'm not adult enough to accept

7821.96 --> 7827.159
that other people don't always accept

7824.159 --> 7827.159
every notion they

7827.239 --> 7830.759999999999
hear that is a

7840.159 --> 7846.199
projection accepting a notion Oh you

7843.599 --> 7847.599
mean an Insight a structural Insight

7846.199 --> 7849.199
that is

7847.599 --> 7852.599
durable

7849.199 --> 7856.719
and fractally implic

7852.599 --> 7860.52
applicable yeah it's not about accepting

7856.719 --> 7864.599
a notion they hear it's about realizing

7860.52 --> 7867.119000000001
the inside of it but if you're too feely

7864.599 --> 7870.88
and touchy and if I hurt

7867.119 --> 7872.96
you yeah then you're not going to accept

7870.88 --> 7876.719
the grand gift of

7872.96 --> 7876.719
insight that I shared

7880.239 --> 7883.239
freely

7888.119 --> 7895.92
so I demand really another

7891.96 --> 7898.88
projection hey clutch do I demand 100%

7895.92 --> 7898.88
compliance to my

7899.96 --> 7903.199
ideas tell

7906.36 --> 7911.839999999999
me I mean I leave this [ __ ] with over

7909.599 --> 7913.9800000000005
here in my chat

7911.84 --> 7916.079
making ridiculous

7913.98 --> 7919.919999999999
[Music]

7916.079 --> 7922.92
statements does that mean that I demand

7919.92 --> 7926.76
100% compliance for my

7922.92 --> 7929.599
ideas I mean your very presence

7926.76 --> 7933.4800000000005
persisting in my chat Lou

7929.599 --> 7936.88
Alcott directly

7933.48 --> 7941.239
proves that your suggestion within your

7936.88 --> 7943.4400000000005
question is 100% wrong you don't even

7941.239 --> 7945.959999999999
seem to realize

7943.44 --> 7948.839999999999
that well you won't be insulted again oh

7945.96 --> 7951.559
so you're going to leave are you are you

7948.84 --> 7953.400000000001
going to leave then or are you going to

7951.559 --> 7956.76
accept

7953.4 --> 7959.4
that you already answered your own

7956.76 --> 7962.320000000001
questions your own stupid questions that

7959.4 --> 7962.32
are very

7962.44 --> 7967.96
obvious right it's very obviously that I

7964.96 --> 7971.52
do not demand 100% compliance to my

7967.96 --> 7972.559
ideas because you're still in my chat

7971.52 --> 7976.559
and

7972.559 --> 7981.28
you leaving because you feel insulted

7976.559 --> 7983.119000000001
doesn't then make your statement

7981.28 --> 7985.639
correct you

7983.119 --> 7988.239
see there's not a lot of things that you

7985.639 --> 7992.04
could do at this point to try to

7988.239 --> 7995.199
win your position from your polarized

7992.04 --> 7995.199
Vantage Point against

7999.84 --> 8003.76
me yeah

8002.199 --> 8006.919999999999
I don't need to

8003.76 --> 8010.1990000000005
delete what you

8006.92 --> 8012.96
said because everything you said only

8010.199 --> 8012.96
proves me

8015.559 --> 8021.92
right but apparently you're

8018.599 --> 8024.88
not capable at this point to find the

8021.92 --> 8029.1990000000005
way through to let it go to let the

8024.88 --> 8033.04
polarization go to see through it to

8029.199 --> 8033.04
laugh over what has happened

8033.48 --> 8038.0
laugh at your

8035.0 --> 8038.0
own

8038.76 --> 8044.400000000001
failure right which is

8041.48 --> 8046.879999999999
okay you can laugh at your own failure I

8044.4 --> 8051.04
laugh at my own failures when when I

8046.88 --> 8053.599
notice because you can't be

8051.04 --> 8055.5199999999995
perfect and actually admitting when

8053.599 --> 8059.079
you're wrong is

8055.52 --> 8063.040000000001
like enormously

8059.079 --> 8063.04
rewarding enormously

8065.679 --> 8069.8
rewarding so you're really missing out

8068.48 --> 8073.44
on that

8069.8 --> 8073.4400000000005
part that great

8080.96 --> 8084.2390000000005
reward oh

8089.199 --> 8093.759999999999
well all of you guys that are still out

8091.88 --> 8095.159000000001
there please don't forget the rogans up

8093.76 --> 8097.679
the

8095.159 --> 8100.48
show it's been very interesting very

8097.679 --> 8100.4800000000005
psychological

8104.32 --> 8108.88
today and yeah those are the shows that

8107.0 --> 8111.8
I find the most interesting especially

8108.88 --> 8113.36
when I find new developments new

8111.8 --> 8116.8
psychological

8113.36 --> 8118.32
insights and this was one hell of an

8116.8 --> 8120.52
insight

8118.32 --> 8123.32
about what the what happens to the

8120.52 --> 8124.719
conscious within a a polarized scenario

8123.32 --> 8128.119
with another

8124.719 --> 8130.88
Consciousness when there's a an

8128.119 --> 8133.598999999999
oppositional argument or philosophy

8130.88 --> 8136.639
playing out how the Consciousness

8133.599 --> 8140.079
perceives the behavior of the other side

8136.639 --> 8141.559
naturally but also the logic behind

8140.079 --> 8146.32
hypocrisy and

8141.559 --> 8150.4400000000005
projection how consciousness of such in

8146.32 --> 8153.759999999999
action like requires you to have like a

8150.44 --> 8155.4
big investment into wanting to achieve

8153.76 --> 8157.1990000000005
that conscious

8155.4 --> 8160.119
projection

8157.199 --> 8163.28
because if you just regularly do it the

8160.119 --> 8166.639
price would be too high it would be a

8163.28 --> 8170.159
sin so you would have to really do it

8166.639 --> 8173.2390000000005
for something big in order to be

8170.159 --> 8175.28
knowingly projecting out there would it

8173.239 --> 8178.959999999999
would have to be for something

8175.28 --> 8182.44
important you wouldn't just casually

8178.96 --> 8184.28
project stuff unless there's something

8182.44 --> 8187.04
you're really holding on to which you

8184.28 --> 8190.599
know like this is

8187.04 --> 8197.24
necessary or this will yield a reward I

8190.599 --> 8197.24
like I need to lie to get to that

8198.96 --> 8204.039999999999
point because

8201.24 --> 8207.639
projecting is very is like a pretty

8204.04 --> 8212.84
egregious sin it Ruffles feathers a

8207.639 --> 8212.839999999998
lot it creates despise

8217.2 --> 8222.359
so yeah casual accidental

8223.84 --> 8231.76
projection is very likely to happen

8229.16 --> 8234.119999999999
subconsciously Without You realizing

8231.76 --> 8236.92
that that is what you're doing because

8234.12 --> 8239.04
of the natural autopilot response

8236.92 --> 8242.84
dealing with the information from your

8239.04 --> 8242.84
Vantage Point within the PO

8244.719 --> 8251.039999999999
argument so people accidentally Project

8249.0 --> 8254.439
without even realizing

8251.04 --> 8258.160000000002
it and then the opponent May perceive

8254.439 --> 8261.76
such projection but then still be

8258.16 --> 8265.119999999999
inclined to think that it is on purpose

8261.76 --> 8268.28
that they lied on purpose basically and

8265.12 --> 8272.240000000002
that is a misjudgment a lot of the time

8268.28 --> 8275.08
you should test whether that is the case

8272.24 --> 8278.599
before jumping to a conclusion about

8275.08 --> 8280.84
it because it is logically more likely

8278.599 --> 8282.8
that it happened

8280.84 --> 8284.76
subconsciously because it is very

8282.8 --> 8286.719
punishing to

8284.76 --> 8289.479
knowingly

8286.719 --> 8293.479
project it's a grave

8289.479 --> 8296.199999999999
hypocrisy and God does not take kindly

8293.479 --> 8296.199999999999
to such an

8297.88 --> 8303.199999999999
action right but that's only if you're

8300.84 --> 8304.76
conscious about it when you do it CU if

8303.2 --> 8307.639000000001
you're not conscious about it's just

8304.76 --> 8310.719000000001
automatically happening then God doesn't

8307.639 --> 8314.518999999998
really get involved God is with

8310.719 --> 8317.518999999998
only involves thems when there's a

8314.519 --> 8317.519
sin

8327.8 --> 8332.719
oh

8329.719 --> 8332.719
uhoh

8342.2 --> 8347.969000000001
[Music]

8351.5 --> 8359.0

tomorrow

8611.84 --> 8615.479
uh there's a good chance tomorrow I

8614.08 --> 8619.52
won't have a

8615.479 --> 8625.438999999998
show an appointment at a very odd

8619.52 --> 8625.439

8649.439 --> 8654.880000000001
show depending on whatever I in a way I

8652.04 --> 8658.960000000001
could like use a bit of a break for a

8654.88 --> 8662.08
bit it's been a very intense week if you

8658.96 --> 8665.399
know what I mean

8662.08 --> 8665.399
right we'll

8668.08 --> 8673.24
see right but at least tomorrow I'm not

8670.72 --> 8675.679999999998
going to be uh doing my early word show

8673.24 --> 8679.52
