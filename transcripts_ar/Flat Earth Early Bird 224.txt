[Music]

41.08 --> 45.97
earlybird number 224 I'm your host

47.65 --> 51.43
platform you deem fit and also if you

50.02 --> 53.230000000000004
haven't already subscribed to my channel

51.43 --> 54.519999999999996
and hit the bell notification so you

53.23 --> 57.76
know when I'm going live which is

54.52 --> 60.88
normally 2:00 p.m. Amsterdam time also

57.76 --> 63.129999999999995
please support my show yeah through the

60.88 --> 68.10000000000001
various ways much appreciated

63.13 --> 76.3
when you do yeah the weather today is

68.1 --> 80.11
hot really really hot and yeah there's

76.3 --> 82.479
still some like a nice breeze what it's

80.11 --> 83.92
not constant and you have to be really

82.479 --> 90.28
in the shadow to be able to appreciate

83.92 --> 93.28
it and yet there is I don't know I

90.28 --> 95.71000000000001
it it kind of looked like chemtrails but

93.28 --> 100.03
with this heat it might really be

95.71 --> 104.11
contrails also because look at that that

100.03 --> 107.89
looks much more like sheep clouds then

104.11 --> 111.46
it was like chem chill wave feathers so

107.89 --> 115.39
I don't know I'm not sure it's just

111.46 --> 116.13
really freaking hot so yeah it's

115.39 --> 121.84
midsummer

116.13 --> 125.74
you know 24th of June hey thanks for the

121.84 --> 127.44
super chat donation grantee five pounds

125.74 --> 135.04
nice

127.44 --> 141.599
Thanks huh yeah I saw you on jaren

135.04 --> 144.069
yesterday that was really good man and

141.599 --> 147.28
yeah very impressive

144.069 --> 150.069
it-it-it that show really made it

147.28 --> 160.329
apparent just how much work you have put

150.069 --> 161.47
into all this yeah so I think you're the

160.329 --> 163.9
your show is going to be extremely

161.47 --> 166.42
interesting and I might have

163.9 --> 169.84
underestimated how much interest there

166.42 --> 177.94
would be in it I don't know maybe it

169.84 --> 179.98000000000002
because yeah because of the well the

177.94 --> 182.95
apparent infighting that might be

179.98 --> 187.72
starting or whatever the unrest among

182.95 --> 193.73899999999998
our ranks I have this with yeah a first

187.72 --> 193.739
slick and what was it slick

197.69 --> 202.43
this isn't now you're just confusing me

199.88 --> 206.06
yeah also yeah the heat okay the heat is

202.43 --> 208.13
just insane I have to marry a coffee

206.06 --> 210.14000000000001
although I have to be careful with it

208.13 --> 214.28
because it might actually aggravate the

210.14 --> 217.57
heat symptoms and T of course and I got

214.28 --> 220.61
a special treat blueberries

217.57 --> 224.89
organic blueberries like I I had to do

220.61 --> 228.89000000000001
that so I'm gonna enjoy that

224.89 --> 231.2
well yeah rant aflutter

228.89 --> 235.19
the thing is about the word slick it's

231.2 --> 237.64999999999998
been kind of like polluted to me but in

235.19 --> 240.749
a literal sense yes it was slick

237.65 --> 240.749
[Music]

244.69 --> 247.32
yeah

254.89 --> 260.72999999999996
oh sure it James Mason

264.71 --> 272.46
well in a way I have more than one

269.34 --> 275.76
agenda right and I've well been trying

272.46 --> 278.48999999999995
to be very open about what I really want

275.76 --> 280.65
to do where I want to go but that is

278.49 --> 287.48
basically just a different type of

280.65 --> 287.47999999999996
agenda that's not really weird isn't it

292.879 --> 297.97900000000004
unless you specifically want to imply

295.249 --> 304.58000000000004
like secret agendas because that that is

297.979 --> 306.83
something else of course right yeah

304.58 --> 309.649
Randy yeah I'm looking forward to it and

306.83 --> 314.56899999999996
I even had like kind of expanding ideas

309.649 --> 318.589
on it like how cool would it be if you

314.569 --> 320.599
could basically well this might require

318.589 --> 322.879
some expansion but you might have

320.599 --> 327.519
thought about it already yourself like

322.879 --> 332.629
eventually get basically a database of

327.519 --> 335.599
subjects and and specific presentations

332.629 --> 338.41900000000004
on that subject by all the different

335.599 --> 339.979
individuals voluntary they can fill it

338.419 --> 342.85999999999996
in and you could literally have a lookup

339.979 --> 344.479
database and just see several different

342.86 --> 348.769
explanations from several different

344.479 --> 350.779
people and they could potentially update

348.769 --> 356.899
it themselves so they could literally

350.779 --> 358.759
just say okay this is how I see it but

356.899 --> 361.069
then the old versions would remain and

358.759 --> 363.499
but they could add on new ones that are

361.069 --> 365.209
now their official representation that

363.499 --> 368.16900000000004
could be extremely interesting it would

365.209 --> 370.55
be like a micro YouTube specifically on

368.169 --> 374.779
flat flat earth and physics related

370.55 --> 377.119
subjects where instead of just being

374.779 --> 379.129
lucky that the search engine on YouTube

377.119 --> 382.03900000000004
is going to give you the right video you

379.129 --> 385.639
could literally have a direct click an

382.039 --> 389.589
answer or click an explanation type of

385.639 --> 389.589
setup how about that Randy

401.89 --> 411.86
yeah tops now it's a t-shirt

407.21 --> 414.77
Jean buff chest all right and I have

411.86 --> 419.84000000000003
like ten of them exactly the same are

414.77 --> 423.85999999999996
mostly the same I'm kind of yeah

419.84 --> 428.79999999999995
monotonous monotonous in my clothing

423.86 --> 428.8
style also because it's kind of cheaper

432.309 --> 443.199
I don't have a lot of room here to stash

434.829 --> 445.29900000000004
a lots of clothes you know but to be

443.199 --> 447.479
fair I'm already kind of longing for a

445.299 --> 450.339
new set of t-shirts because they are

447.479 --> 452.37899999999996
slowly wearing it's not like high

450.339 --> 457.299
quality brand t-shirts they're pretty

452.379 --> 462.189
basic and yet they do wear out yeah

457.299 --> 464.459
after a few years so everything in due

462.189 --> 464.459
time

479.84 --> 486.07
what what are you talking about right

483.83 --> 486.07
ahead

486.16 --> 492.41
why does that dude have implants wet

489.86 --> 499.76
which which dude are you talking about

492.41 --> 503.54
are you talking about me mm-hmm because

499.76 --> 511.639
I yeah I guarantee you I have not had

503.54 --> 514.25
any ocean offered Sean Sean offered but

511.639 --> 521.65
I i I've never I don't think I remember

514.25 --> 521.65
seeing him all right

527.15 --> 538.01
yeah you know I don't know if you guys

533.96 --> 541.46
have noticed but since I've came became

538.01 --> 543.47
yeah really got onto YouTube the only

541.46 --> 545.99
time I ever really like get into like

543.47 --> 547.7900000000001
troll fighting is when I'm at some

545.99 --> 550.37
hangout where I have something

547.79 --> 551.99
interesting to follow and and I then get

550.37 --> 554.51
caught up with freaking trolls or

551.99 --> 557.77
something that pisses me off okay but

554.51 --> 562.75
you might have taken notice that I never

557.77 --> 565.9399999999999
ever make videos about ballers or

562.75 --> 569.36
something [ __ ] they say like for

565.94 --> 575.839
example Riley loves to do that okay I

569.36 --> 578.45
never do that and I really try my best

575.839 --> 581.0290000000001
to totally ignore everything about them

578.45 --> 584.4200000000001
even though people literally try to

581.029 --> 587.21
attack me with trying to get my

584.42 --> 590.18
attention to them they do that there's

587.21 --> 593.9590000000001
trolls out there that do that I know how

590.18 --> 596.81
that works but I'm this is my policy I

593.959 --> 602.7199999999999
literally try to ignore them that is the

596.81 --> 606.4399999999999
worst I could do and it is really like

602.72 --> 611.5600000000001
an ignoring in an excommunication kind

606.44 --> 611.5600000000001
of way and I hold this policy with with

612.82 --> 619.36
with the other Shaun with Shaun rage

616.37 --> 622.36
Shaun you know who I'm talking about

619.36 --> 622.36
[ __ ]

622.68 --> 629.04
and yeah you noticed this on on Jose's

627.18 --> 631.05
hangout yesterday like he started all

629.04 --> 635.3
wise asking me and I'm like yeah I'm

631.05 --> 638.309
literally not gonna talk to you because

635.3 --> 643.05
anything I would do would be more than

638.309 --> 645.35
he would deserve and I know hundred

643.05 --> 648.7199999999999
percent sure that he would do nothing

645.35 --> 651.72
constructive with it and only try to use

648.72 --> 654.179
it to get to me more because he is a

651.72 --> 659.48
nasty person

654.179 --> 663.119
he is a taunter a natural born hunter I

659.48 --> 665.189
bet he probably used it militarily even

663.119 --> 667.0500000000001
because that could be very useful in

665.189 --> 675.209
certain setups so I wouldn't be

667.05 --> 676.74
surprised but I'm just gonna I'm gonna

675.209 --> 678.66
talk to the guy there's nothing

676.74 --> 681.779
constructive ever coming out of it I've

678.66 --> 687.649
never heard in anything say more than

681.779 --> 692.48
just like stories just stupid stories

687.649 --> 697.429
this is Satan I wouldn't go that far but

692.48 --> 697.429
I do really find him very pathetic

698.38 --> 703.75
[Music]

700.61 --> 703.75
it's like

704.49 --> 709.98
he's leaning on his supposed

707.33 --> 714.1800000000001
accomplishments and allowing himself to

709.98 --> 717.87
become a vile disgusting monster because

714.18 --> 719.88
like but yeah at least I have that so I

717.87 --> 725.82
could do anything that's that's what he

719.88 --> 729.51
does and it is nasty like I wouldn't

725.82 --> 731.94
want to get caught like at some point I

729.51 --> 734.52
hope sort of like it leads to accomplish

731.94 --> 737.82
a little bit more I had like I have in

734.52 --> 739.59
the past getting back to that that peak

737.82 --> 746.85
moment where I just do a lot of stuff

739.59 --> 750.3000000000001
and set up things and but I yeah I would

746.85 --> 752.0400000000001
never once I had so even now right I've

750.3 --> 755.6099999999999
been on the flatter see that I kind of

752.04 --> 757.86
I'm a second tier guy not the first wave

755.61 --> 761.1
but the second one that's where I came

757.86 --> 763.92
in very persistent very presence very

761.1 --> 769.71
outspoken my own ideas and I'm proud of

763.92 --> 774.3
that but I'm not gonna be like my god I

769.71 --> 781.38
am so much better at it you're not

774.3 --> 783.4499999999999
worthy because there's always something

781.38 --> 787.46
you can talk about if the other one is

783.45 --> 793.2900000000001
at least open-minded and able to take

787.46 --> 795.99
legitimate criticism even if brought

793.29 --> 799.14
harshly when I get really impatient with

795.99 --> 801.09
people then I will start every very mild

799.14 --> 803.0699999999999
with my criticism at first especially

801.09 --> 805.02
with people that are nice but when

803.07 --> 807.5400000000001
people start to act like [ __ ] more

805.02 --> 811.26
and more and I will become harsher with

807.54 --> 813.39
still legitimate criticism and that's

811.26 --> 815.49
just how I do things I don't know I it

813.39 --> 819.75
try to be as persistent with it as

815.49 --> 826.55
possible it is now

819.75 --> 831.0
hmm wow that was such a good idea

826.55 --> 836.55
well they're all sweet tiny little bit

831.0 --> 851.28
sour and nice fresh and good aftertaste

836.55 --> 852.7199999999999
lovely stuff anyway let's let's see Wow

851.28 --> 859.3199999999999
I've got a lot of people in chat by the

852.72 --> 865.14
way yeah had a tiring back 1/4 to Daniel

James Mason NASA to the moon okay I get

946.42 --> 950.74
a weird feeling I'm being visited by a

948.25 --> 954.43
couple of socks but fine as long as they

950.74 --> 957.61
behave theo Megawati hello Ragnar

954.43 --> 959.709
Stephan elderson no you're not still

957.61 --> 961.2090000000001
blocked and that's a stupid question

959.709 --> 962.89
if you want to find out if you're

961.209 --> 964.42
blocked you should just say hello and

962.89 --> 966.85
then look if you can see the three dots

964.42 --> 969.04
next to you if you don't then you're

966.85 --> 973.089
blocked otherwise you're just gonna look

969.04 --> 975.5699999999999
like an ass just say hey peanuts Clark

973.089 --> 975.57
good morning

976.95 --> 980.0490000000001
[Music]

986.88 --> 993.31
hmm

988.99 --> 996.52
oh look limited viewing angle answer

993.31 --> 1003.3
very look how big it is it's concealing

996.52 --> 1006.48
my head oh my god it's so big so small

1003.3 --> 1008.51
you can barely see it you can barely see

1006.48 --> 1008.51
it

1016.19 --> 1019.5500000000001
and it's gone

1028.11 --> 1036.0
a PC peanuts Clark I'm not gonna

1033.409 --> 1042.23
elaborate on the details don't want to

1036.0 --> 1042.23
give any hostile people ideas

1061.19 --> 1067.309
right nice nice Chris Matt exactly

1097.02 --> 1104.04
okay that's funny that's just as a funny

1101.76 --> 1106.26
remark there more more detailed the

1104.04 --> 1110.51
angular size of the Sun doesn't change

1106.26 --> 1115.2
as night falls hmm

1110.51 --> 1119.58
well technically you are correct but the

1115.2 --> 1120.99
thing is there's no some presence during

1119.58 --> 1123.71
nightfall at all

1120.99 --> 1127.49
so yeah there is no angular size

1123.71 --> 1127.49
basically in the night

1133.35 --> 1140.31
[Music]

1134.82 --> 1143.23
besides angular angular size is based on

1140.31 --> 1145.9299999999998
observation if it's not there for you to

1143.23 --> 1149.6200000000001
observe than anything that you assume

1145.93 --> 1152.1000000000001
will be based on presuppositional

1149.62 --> 1152.1
reasoning

1156.899 --> 1164.4699999999998
while NASA to the moon I don't know

1161.519 --> 1171.059
easier in chat or at least he was here

1164.47 --> 1176.47
in chat for a while but I don't know I

1171.059 --> 1180.269
think not I think that ranty might be

1176.47 --> 1180.269
even more sick of it than I am

1182.7 --> 1191.2
because look as people have been telling

1186.49 --> 1193.36
me yeah I have been basically been poo

1191.2 --> 1195.8790000000001
pooed and laughed at and scoffed at by a

1193.36 --> 1201.519
lot of other flat-earthers from the

1195.879 --> 1204.039
start well and I persisted okay because

1201.519 --> 1206.35
I knew I'm onto something I know I

1204.039 --> 1208.57
understand my mind I'm not gonna mistake

1206.35 --> 1213.9289999999999
my insight for some kind of illusion

1208.57 --> 1216.58
like everybody was suggesting and yeah

1213.929 --> 1223.1200000000001
but because of that process I'm just

1216.58 --> 1226.21
used to that [ __ ] and at the same time

1223.12 --> 1229.779
as I've talked about very elaborately on

1226.21 --> 1232.72
my show I recognise that flat earthers

1229.779 --> 1237.279
that engage with ballers a lot just have

1232.72 --> 1239.6200000000001
to deal with well at least it will be

1237.279 --> 1243.279
experienced to them as if dealing with

1239.62 --> 1245.529
lunatics and yeah whether they are

1243.279 --> 1248.11
literally lunatics is slightly up for

1245.529 --> 1253.779
debate it's very complex because it is

1248.11 --> 1255.9399999999998
societal so but because of that

1253.779 --> 1258.46
interaction that constant stress there

1255.94 --> 1262.1490000000001
is just a lot of need to lash out this

1258.46 --> 1264.1000000000001
is what eventually under long during

1262.149 --> 1268.4399999999998
pressure tends to cause sudden

1264.1 --> 1271.4499999999998
infighting it's like everybody feels up

1268.44 --> 1272.98
about issues with other people and then

1271.45 --> 1275.679
at some point they're just so sick of

1272.98 --> 1277.3890000000001
it's like now I'm done and that happens

1275.679 --> 1281.019
a lot

1277.389 --> 1282.9699999999998
quite often among flat earth also among

1281.019 --> 1286.509
the more baller channels by the way

1282.97 --> 1289.929
interestingly enough compared to yeah

1286.509 --> 1292.539
you tubers or Video Maker show how

1289.929 --> 1294.3990000000001
of other programs there's a lot more

1292.539 --> 1296.889
stress going on and that just causes

1294.399 --> 1300.34
this infighting so yeah one for example

1296.889 --> 1303.2199999999998
Nathan started shouting at me as he

1300.34 --> 1306.9399999999998
typically does are we and you know any

1303.22 --> 1309.97
and he's really been not doing that

1306.94 --> 1312.5800000000002
actively so I again take notice of that

1309.97 --> 1314.74
I appreciate that but at the same time I

1312.58 --> 1318.039
recognize that yeah the guys under so

1314.74 --> 1320.139
much pressure really because he's a busy

1318.039 --> 1325.149
guy as a family and he's doing this show

1320.139 --> 1327.7589999999998
and having to somehow yeah

1325.149 --> 1330.1
basically also take the steering wheel

1327.759 --> 1335.35
and exert a lot of energy and that

1330.1 --> 1338.1999999999998
really put down a like a king's worthy

1335.35 --> 1339.73
attempt to defend Flat Earth and attack

1338.2 --> 1342.3690000000001
the ball like he's really putting

1339.73 --> 1348.879
everything into it everything that he

1342.369 --> 1352.029
can and yeah I am NOT surprised that

1348.879 --> 1354.9599999999998
when I then typically like quickly get

1352.029 --> 1359.019
in between that yeah that will typically

1354.96 --> 1363.429
trigger like the tension from lashing

1359.019 --> 1365.519
out and that'll be me and yeah in a way

1363.429 --> 1368.019
I kind of deserve that

1365.519 --> 1371.23
it used to be a lot worse before I

1368.019 --> 1372.82
started the early bird show it's a very

1371.23 --> 1373.679
distinct difference you should check

1372.82 --> 1376.269
that out

1373.679 --> 1379.1190000000001
just look up when my first early bird

1376.269 --> 1381.039
show was and then before that time go

1379.119 --> 1384.039
and look at flat earth debates where

1381.039 --> 1387.369
while I was on you'll notice that it

1384.039 --> 1391.47
sadly my interruption and being a

1387.369 --> 1391.47
nuisance really dropped down

1406.93 --> 1415.46
okay right yeah yeah about that I have

1413.39 --> 1419.39
no idea what they actually discussed in

1415.46 --> 1421.73
detail but yeah it's one of the reasons

1419.39 --> 1427.4
I don't engage with John I've tried it

1421.73 --> 1433.39
sort of and the guys in tenable you can

1427.4 --> 1436.76
talk with him he's not up for for a talk

1433.39 --> 1439.94
so I'd I haven't tried for a long time

1436.76 --> 1443.11
and Randi did that kind of in a in a

1439.94 --> 1445.49
force move like an ultimatum move and

1443.11 --> 1448.37
yeah I knew of course if that's gonna

1445.49 --> 1450.71
happen yeah that's gonna happen I knew

1448.37 --> 1454.61
there was very yeah as soon as she told

1450.71 --> 1456.29
me I knew oh right of course that's why

1454.61 --> 1457.79
I don't do that even though John has

1456.29 --> 1461.03
tried to sort of challenge me and I just

1457.79 --> 1463.1
say didn't know it's I'm gonna say what

1461.03 --> 1466.16
I'm gonna say you can respond to it and

1463.1 --> 1468.9199999999998
then I'll analyze your response and he

1466.16 --> 1472.5400000000002
has sort of done that sort of up to some

1468.92 --> 1476.6000000000001
certain degree but I'm not gonna

1472.54 --> 1479.3
basically be subjected to his type of

1476.6 --> 1482.9199999999998
drill sergeants attitude and enforcing

1479.3 --> 1485.72
rules just with the mayor gesture

1482.92 --> 1488.51
because some of the rules are definitely

1485.72 --> 1491.33
true and I I do go with along with them

1488.51 --> 1494.93
but the others are like up for debates a

1491.33 --> 1496.76
very complex in in their routes I'm not

1494.93 --> 1501.22
just not going along with that [ __ ] I

1496.76 --> 1505.84
have something better to do and and

1501.22 --> 1505.84
that's why I don't directly engage John

1506.37 --> 1509.58
[Music]

1510.049 --> 1515.6
that's it

1511.409 --> 1515.6000000000001
anyway more blueberries for me

1522.01 --> 1531.33
not a CGI ranty and that will only

1526.63 --> 1531.3300000000002
happen if Nathan allows it

1537.74 --> 1544.159
because in the end there's basically an

1542.21 --> 1548.57
inevitable thing that will happen and

1544.159 --> 1550.46
that is and I don't know maybe already

1548.57 --> 1553.76
things like this already happened in the

1550.46 --> 1555.38
back I have no idea look I don't keep a

1553.76 --> 1558.679
lot of tabs on what Nathan's really

1555.38 --> 1561.919
doing I don't see where and how he chats

1558.679 --> 1563.8090000000002
a lot if he even does that it doesn't

1561.919 --> 1569.39
really chat a lot in the master be for

1563.809 --> 1571.97
example and inevitably it will end up

1569.39 --> 1573.6200000000001
that Nathan's just gonna say or is

1571.97 --> 1575.8990000000001
pretty much gonna do the same thing with

1573.62 --> 1578.87
QA as Randy and just say like yeah this

1575.899 --> 1580.1899999999998
can't work anymore yeah we have to you

1578.87 --> 1583.61
have to have a different attitude and

1580.19 --> 1588.169
then he will say okay that's fine I'll

1583.61 --> 1590.6
just leave and that's it there's there's

1588.169 --> 1593.8400000000001
just no other way because the guy is

1590.6 --> 1597.4399999999998
never gonna change might even be some

1593.84 --> 1600.559
kind of neuro traumatic thing that's

1597.44 --> 1601.21
keeping him like that I don't know what

1600.559 --> 1606.6399999999999
it is

1601.21 --> 1606.64
but he is utterly utterly inflexible

1612.87 --> 1618.4189999999999
yeah now when you really need a camera

1614.97 --> 1622.169
because Randy's gone yeah I do

1618.419 --> 1624.3600000000001
Oh that look Randy is not gum Randy has

1622.169 --> 1626.8200000000002
his own channel check it out subscribe

1624.36 --> 1632.1
to Randy Flat Earth it's a really good

1626.82 --> 1640.07
Channel and he just has these amazing

1632.1 --> 1641.34
videos and let me linking up him hmm

1640.07 --> 1645.559
yeah

1641.34 --> 1648.87
since Patricia left I I made Randy into

1645.559 --> 1653.1
replaced him as a favorite in the

1648.87 --> 1655.58
recommended list so yeah yes monk check

1653.1 --> 1659.6399999999999
it out subscribe to him he's still there

1655.58 --> 1665.73
and he's still actively yesterday he was

1659.64 --> 1675.45
on gerunds and and soon his new shows

1665.73 --> 1678.799
gonna start up so you know if I'm gonna

1675.45 --> 1682.529
stay with Nathan well sort of yeah I

1678.799 --> 1684.96
tagged along and when I feel like it I

1682.529 --> 1686.94
involve myself but hey there's been

1684.96 --> 1690.029
plenty of shows where I basically say a

1686.94 --> 1692.0700000000002
few words and then like make lunch and

1690.029 --> 1693.27
don't show up for half an hour and

1692.07 --> 1695.309
there's even been times where I

1693.27 --> 1696.6
literally joined get with the

1695.309 --> 1698.279
housekeeping then as soon as the

1696.6 --> 1700.799
housekeeping is over I go and get

1698.279 --> 1705.059
groceries and get back like an hour

1700.799 --> 1705.899
later so I don't know yeah I am a

1705.059 --> 1709.95
panelist there

1705.899 --> 1713.85
I still feel welcome also I'm getting to

1709.95 --> 1717.169
know really interesting new

1713.85 --> 1717.1689999999999
flat-earthers there

1718.559 --> 1726.279
and that's good enough for me

1722.799 --> 1732.46
yeah you know it's it's still worth my

1726.279 --> 1734.289
time but yeah when QE gets on and gets

1732.46 --> 1738.07
all involved with everything I usually

1734.289 --> 1741.269
kind of zone out when that happens yeah

1738.07 --> 1741.269
that's that's all up to Nathan

1741.83 --> 1746.1999999999998
[Music]

1752.27 --> 1757.04
you don't like I like how he treats me

1755.21 --> 1763.44
okay

1757.04 --> 1766.5
well speak out about it if you really

1763.44 --> 1773.16
feel that I'm not embarrassed if you do

1766.5 --> 1778.4
that but you have to understand it's

1773.16 --> 1783.03
just not wise to like openly defend or

1778.4 --> 1786.5700000000002
like say no to any of that [ __ ] because

1783.03 --> 1788.76
it's just gonna I kind of did that

1786.57 --> 1793.04
before and what happens is that Nathan

1788.76 --> 1795.39
then really gets ticked off with me and

1793.04 --> 1798.6599999999999
yeah that's not good for anyone it's not

1795.39 --> 1803.0400000000002
good for him not good for me you know

1798.66 --> 1805.5900000000001
and the worst I could do is but yeah the

1803.04 --> 1807.809
kind of sort of indirect punishment that

1805.59 --> 1813.809
I can inflict is just say okay fine I'm

1807.809 --> 1818.1
just not gonna get involved anymore you

1813.809 --> 1823.1399999999999
know I don't feel I nearly need to lash

1818.1 --> 1825.24
out or lash out back unless it is in a

1823.14 --> 1827.97
discussion where my actual intellect is

1825.24 --> 1830.309
getting involved with for I say for

1827.97 --> 1833.25
example baller maybe Brad now or

1830.309 --> 1835.6499999999999
whatever and then they are trying to

1833.25 --> 1838.94
trick we with semantics for example oh

1835.65 --> 1841.44
yeah I will get fired up about that

1838.94 --> 1843.75
because that is actually about

1841.44 --> 1846.26
intellectual honesty and dishonesty and

1843.75 --> 1848.79
that that is something where I

1846.26 --> 1855.24
definitely pay attention and let my self

1848.79 --> 1858.1499999999999
flare up in the moment but outside of

1855.24 --> 1860.52
that just with social dealings and the

1858.15 --> 1863.1000000000001
hierarchy the apparent hierarchy in the

1860.52 --> 1864.69
show there's not much I can really do

1863.1 --> 1868.559
about it you know I can't complain about

1864.69 --> 1873.179
it I have but sometimes I really don't

1868.559 --> 1875.73
even need to because yeah I've heard

1873.179 --> 1878.5500000000002
plenty of times where Nathan got kind of

1875.73 --> 1881.01
lashed out to me or whatever and then

1878.55 --> 1885.33
after a while or the next day he would

1881.01 --> 1891.669
like very gallantly apologized to me so

1885.33 --> 1894.25
see like he's not a like a merciless

1891.669 --> 1901.47
dick about it or anything so don't worry

1894.25 --> 1904.47
oh my god right now yes you do Randa a

1901.47 --> 1904.47
weasel

1906.9 --> 1910.029
[Music]

1919.779 --> 1926.119
all right qe

1923.69 --> 1928.1000000000001
yeah Ragnar Stefan Helder son says QE

1926.119 --> 1932.149
has taken over the show no he is only

1928.1 --> 1943.299
pushing young earth creation okay job

1932.149 --> 1948.529
maybe that's his thing you know it to me

1943.299 --> 1950.36
it's not even about what QE believes or

1948.529 --> 1955.309
his methodology

1950.36 --> 1961.2389999999998
it's his rigidity and inflexibility and

1955.309 --> 1965.539
just his demeaning punishing and

1961.239 --> 1967.8790000000001
merciless attitude and that is just that

1965.539 --> 1974.21
is it is really the social aspect about

1967.879 --> 1976.6999999999998
it because if he was just a a person

1974.21 --> 1979.489
that didn't put on his sergeant hat or

1976.7 --> 1981.409
whatever you know and just acted like a

1979.489 --> 1983.539
normal person then he could have these

1981.409 --> 1987.169
beliefs and I would debate them with

1983.539 --> 1989.749
them and I'd be very gallant but because

1987.169 --> 1993.8590000000002
of the way he acts it's just there's no

1989.749 --> 1995.08
use trying it and that is what I don't

1993.859 --> 1998.749
like about him

1995.08 --> 2000.4289999999999
and yeah I don't know if I haven't seen

1998.749 --> 2004.049
any sign that there is any change to

2000.429 --> 2004.049
that No

2012.61 --> 2023.6589999999999
and besides seriously how much influence

2018.529 --> 2030.049
does qyz beliefs really really influence

2023.659 --> 2033.5490000000002
everyone for real how much because yeah

2030.049 --> 2036.47
he is kind of good at sort of winning

2033.549 --> 2038.6589999999999
the situation although yeah a lot of

2036.47 --> 2044.809
people will just like snap from that and

2038.659 --> 2045.8600000000001
just say this is all [ __ ] but now I

2044.809 --> 2047.77
lost my point

2045.86 --> 2054.19
damn it too hot

2047.77 --> 2054.19
[Music]

2062.59 --> 2076.81
I said now I think I said enough about

2065.56 --> 2079.18
this man that's where the most delicious

2076.81 --> 2083.5
blueberries ever can't believe they're

2079.18 --> 2086.46
already done yes I could like eat three

2083.5 --> 2086.46
times more than that

2091.01 --> 2115.1600000000003
hmm oh yeah I got fridge cool - water

2094.25 --> 2120.91
also it's still cool anyway yeah I seem

2115.16 --> 2120.91
to be having a lot of Watchers 62 nice

2129.68 --> 2138.1699999999996
oh look a reckoner Stefan hey listen you

2133.97 --> 2140.2999999999997
have to understand that it's not so much

2138.17 --> 2143.78
a political statement or look it's just

2140.3 --> 2152.7400000000002
that he personally he doesn't like this

2143.78 --> 2155.9
and also look Randy is really a an

2152.74 --> 2158.27
expansion an expanding guy in the sense

2155.9 --> 2160.34
that he is really ambitious with this

2158.27 --> 2162.2
and he is really putting more he's

2160.34 --> 2165.92
becoming more and more professional

2162.2 --> 2167.6
about everything so technically yeah

2165.92 --> 2171.02
he's been learning a lot he's been doing

2167.6 --> 2173.86
a lot anything I I think for him it's

2171.02 --> 2179.95
just time to now really become his own

2173.86 --> 2179.9500000000003
show host he's like up for the next tier

2180.31 --> 2185.18
and in a way I think he's gonna be doing

2183.35 --> 2187.67
even much yeah he's going to be doing a

2185.18 --> 2190.52
lot better than me because yeah what I

2187.67 --> 2192.44
do it's kind of just turn out turning

2190.52 --> 2200.75
out to be just me talking and if I'm

2192.44 --> 2203.86
lucky a bunch of guests talking and that

2200.75 --> 2206.81
may be also because of the time slot

2203.86 --> 2210.92
because this is really kind of in a way

2206.81 --> 2214.88
the first show of the day so not

2210.92 --> 2218.06
everybody is in for the yea for in like

2214.88 --> 2219.9100000000003
you're heavy or more stressful back and

2218.06 --> 2222.5
forth

2219.91 --> 2226.04
maybe I mellow people out I don't know

2222.5 --> 2229.58
what it is I hope to basically wake

2226.04 --> 2232.04
people up on the long run but also try

2229.58 --> 2234.83
to like wake them up on the short run

2232.04 --> 2238.96
and like get their attention more

2234.83 --> 2241.859
focused that this is what I hope to do

2238.96 --> 2245.44
but yeah

2241.859 --> 2247.3289999999997
but yeah maybe you know I have also

2245.44 --> 2251.049
thought that like I might at some point

2247.329 --> 2256.539
chain change this show or rather kind of

2251.049 --> 2258.97
stop this show yeah on the other hand it

2256.539 --> 2261.4300000000003
feels like come on at least I have to

2258.97 --> 2265.8689999999997
like go for a year so maybe I'll go up

2261.43 --> 2270.3089999999997
to early bird number 333 and that'd be

2265.869 --> 2275.049
running for almost 1/2 year or four

2270.309 --> 2278.4990000000003
seasons and yeah then I might really

2275.049 --> 2281.44
change up the schedule and start to get

2278.499 --> 2283.5989999999997
a evening slot and really get change it

2281.44 --> 2286.66
over to the night owl show because that

2283.599 --> 2289.9
way I am absolutely guaranteed to get

2286.66 --> 2293.98
panelists would be much easier to do

2289.9 --> 2297.7000000000003
that but for now the early bird show is

2293.98 --> 2300.819
gonna go on for at least the rest of the

2297.7 --> 2307.6299999999997
year I'm pretty sure I see no reason to

2300.819 --> 2312.48
stop it yeah exactly - number 333 I

2307.63 --> 2312.48
think that is the perfect time

2317.29 --> 2333.68
[Music]

2318.47 --> 2336.569
you know I love those numbers but yeah

2333.68 --> 2338.97
you know every time I get people on I

2336.569 --> 2340.5
can have like good morning conversations

2338.97 --> 2342.3289999999997
like for example every time peanuts

2340.5 --> 2346.2
Clark come on it's really like a morning

2342.329 --> 2350.6090000000004
breakfast conversation I love it or yeah

2346.2 --> 2352.5589999999997
yesterday with Lisa um also well yeah

2350.609 --> 2359.04
not so much a morning breakfast but just

2352.559 --> 2363.5890000000004
a chill Sunday early afternoon kind of

2359.04 --> 2366.98
thing that was nice but the heat and

2363.589 --> 2370.68
that seems to be what this show is

2366.98 --> 2372.15
drawing in so this is not really the

2370.68 --> 2374.46
heated debate show and yeah although

2372.15 --> 2376.6800000000003
Brenda for example seems to keep

2374.46 --> 2385.17
offering herself like oh I'll come on

2376.68 --> 2386.6699999999996
the show she does that a lot but yeah

2385.17 --> 2388.7400000000002
I'm not always in the mood and besides

2386.67 --> 2390.079
mostly it just does the same thing every

2388.74 --> 2394.3489999999997
time

2390.079 --> 2397.559
what yeah in an evening show then at

2394.349 --> 2399.599
night I'll show and then well definitely

2397.559 --> 2402.2400000000002
at first if I when I start doing the

2399.599 --> 2404.069
night I'll show switch to that I'll

2402.24 --> 2406.319
first start out kind of doing is in the

2404.069 --> 2409.68
evening get it few guests on and then

2406.319 --> 2412.41
probably after a few episodes step over

2409.68 --> 2417.299
into a panel format thing I might even

2412.41 --> 2419.3999999999996
use the the the new system that Jose is

2417.299 --> 2424.23
also using it's it looks pretty

2419.4 --> 2427.6800000000003
interesting and if Google Hangouts kind

2424.23 --> 2429.18
of stops working it's already bugging or

2427.68 --> 2433.2
I've don't use it anymore I just use

2429.18 --> 2435.69
Skype now but that that other that new

2433.2 --> 2439.799
Google thing works pretty decently

2435.69 --> 2442.02
there's no sniping though so yeah once

2439.799 --> 2443.849
you have an open panel it it will turn

2442.02 --> 2448.13
into a [ __ ] show and that yeah I'll go

2443.849 --> 2448.13
we know that happens at Jose's

2450.56 --> 2455.34
or I might just keep on doing it through

2453.27 --> 2458.79
Skype hey I got a lot of people on the

2455.34 --> 2462.51
Skype and I mean a lot of people now I

2458.79 --> 2466.2599999999998
can't believe how many let's see

2462.51 --> 2469.82
contacts where's the where's a pan add

2466.26 --> 2469.82
up number four contacts

2474.69 --> 2478.88
Jesus okay that's

2479.72 --> 2489.77
that's like huh it must be almost 200 or

2483.26 --> 2493.69
something yeah anyway I think that the

2489.77 --> 2496.7599999999998
evening time since at least half

2493.69 --> 2499.4
everyone I kinda know concerning Flat

2496.76 --> 2502.5400000000004
Earth is American I think that for me

2499.4 --> 2508.119
the later slot would be much better for

2502.54 --> 2512.69
a more stable audience and participant

2508.119 --> 2520.67
list so yeah we'll see it's it's it will

2512.69 --> 2526.099
be there eventually yeah yeah thanks

2520.67 --> 2532.94
thanks for that so I wanted to work at a

2526.099 --> 2536.51
factory I I just go and do that but who

2532.94 --> 2538.25
knows maybe if I get desperate enough I

2536.51 --> 2541.3390000000004
might take you up on that offer

2538.25 --> 2544.819
but for now things are looking ok look

2541.339 --> 2547.22
my financial situation still is doing

2544.819 --> 2552.94
good relatively I just had a few

2547.22 --> 2555.89
setbacks that I explained in detail so

2552.94 --> 2558.589
and because of that I kind of lost my

2555.89 --> 2560.69
upward momentum that I was basically

2558.589 --> 2562.79
assuming that I could do that and I was

2560.69 --> 2564.8
wrong about it but that doesn't mean

2562.79 --> 2566.75
that my overall situation is in a

2564.8 --> 2569.05
downward spiral or anything absolutely

2566.75 --> 2571.49
not

2569.05 --> 2574.4900000000002
compared to say four years ago and doing

2571.49 --> 2577.04
a lot better than I do now financially

2574.49 --> 2581.24
as well as mentally and just my overall

2577.04 --> 2583.2799999999997
health condition oh yeah thankfully I

2581.24 --> 2589.0099999999998
also seem to be completely rid of now

2583.28 --> 2591.369
the last remnants of of the coughing and

2589.01 --> 2591.369
everything

2592.14 --> 2596.83
so we I can I just keep on doing the

2595.03 --> 2600.27
show I haven't even taken notice of like

2596.83 --> 2603.0699999999997
oh yeah wait it's gone mm-hmm

2600.27 --> 2607.99
it's probably gone for two full days now

2603.07 --> 2611.8
anyway so yeah I hope you guys like my

2607.99 --> 2619.8599999999997
idea of what I'm planning for may be in

2611.8 --> 2623.3100000000004
2020 2029 oh yeah 22 any night ow

2619.86 --> 2623.31
how about that

2650.14 --> 2653.0099999999998
mm-hmm

2665.74 --> 2676.06
oh by the way just a little side note

2671.33 --> 2678.98
note will was extremely annoying right

2676.06 --> 2681.41
most of you won't it's like the subject

2678.98 --> 2685.099
itself is not interesting but like I

2681.41 --> 2687.29
look at the infowar store again yeah

2685.099 --> 2690.59
last time I could I can't use it because

2687.29 --> 2691.27
it doesn't take the paypal or anything

2690.59 --> 2696.2000000000003
anymore

2691.27 --> 2699.53
as we all know but I try just to try

2696.2 --> 2702.29
that like okay and then I noticed that

2699.53 --> 2705.5800000000004
like the price of shipping has doubled

2702.29 --> 2705.58
like what

2706.45 --> 2713.33
it's crazy so technically if you'd order

2710.66 --> 2715.8489999999997
like something that would be worth a

2713.33 --> 2717.44
hundred dollars you'd be paying $50 on

2715.849 --> 2722.9300000000003
top of that just for shipping that's

2717.44 --> 2728.619
just maniacal so I guess that's because

2722.93 --> 2728.6189999999997
of tariffs or something and it sucks

2737.87 --> 2741.0499999999997
[Music]

2752.34 --> 2755.09
mmm

2755.28 --> 2762.0
yeah Trumpy kana did do it but on the

2759.78 --> 2765.3300000000004
other hand I do recognize that there

2762.0 --> 2770.73
yeah there is it is like a chess game

2765.33 --> 2773.73
and putting tariffs on is kind of like

2770.73 --> 2776.64
building laws financial walls and there

2773.73 --> 2779.46
is like a direct downside to it just as

2776.64 --> 2780.99
like free economic traffic is basically

2779.46 --> 2782.82
just walking straight for it solely

2780.99 --> 2785.3399999999997
there's walls and suddenly you have to

2782.82 --> 2786.27
go to specific doorways and [ __ ]

2785.34 --> 2789.86
maybe tolls

2786.27 --> 2793.56
that's super annoying for free trade but

2789.86 --> 2797.28
it will kind of enforce rearrangements

2793.56 --> 2797.88
of how things are set up and at that

2797.28 --> 2802.1400000000003
part

2797.88 --> 2804.69
I think there's I've seen analysis

2802.14 --> 2807.99
articles news articles just writing

2804.69 --> 2811.05
pieces that made that made me kind of

2807.99 --> 2814.1699999999996
mores understand like what the long term

2811.05 --> 2816.69
function is so yeah for me that's really

2814.17 --> 2818.73
annoying right now but on the other hand

2816.69 --> 2824.31
I don't have actually money to do it

2818.73 --> 2826.32
anyway but I just yeah there's

2824.31 --> 2828.81
definitely supplements and stuff he has

2826.32 --> 2830.7000000000003
that I would like to order if I could

2828.81 --> 2835.43
but yeah I don't have the money really

2830.7 --> 2835.43
and now that shipping costs on top of it

2838.13 --> 2846.62
yeah but yeah that happened

2846.739 --> 2852.989
and yeah it is due to the the trade wars

2850.14 --> 2860.239
the tariffs tariffs are like walls for

2852.989 --> 2866.359
the for trade and it is directly

2860.239 --> 2868.89
countering free trade but rather

2866.359 --> 2873.8089999999997
unrestricted free trade and that is

2868.89 --> 2877.859
basically globalism because it is the

2873.809 --> 2881.009
rules that are enforced are very weird

2877.859 --> 2883.14
it's very unbalanced everything is just

2881.009 --> 2885.239
out sourced by the most insane slave

2883.14 --> 2888.8089999999997
labor conditions and everything's okay

2885.239 --> 2891.2
that is what globalism is and the

2888.809 --> 2894.3590000000004
terrorists absolutely break that

2891.2 --> 2896.839
absolutely break it and that is good but

2894.359 --> 2900.509
yeah because everything has become so

2896.839 --> 2904.0389999999998
ultra dependent on the free didi yeah

2900.509 --> 2906.93
the insane globalism free trade

2904.039 --> 2908.67
that's why suddenly there's a direct

2906.93 --> 2911.549
economic lash back and that is just

2908.67 --> 2915.39
palpable and that's really annoying but

2911.549 --> 2919.759
it might eventually enforce that things

2915.39 --> 2922.2889999999998
rearrange themselves and localize that

2919.759 --> 2924.869
things are actually going to be produced

2922.289 --> 2928.17
locally rather than just some freaking

2924.869 --> 2931.4100000000003
slave country somewhere and then there's

2928.17 --> 2933.839
more direct product there guarantee the

2931.41 --> 2936.019
standards are much easier to enforce you

2933.839 --> 2938.729
don't have to deal with some mega

2936.019 --> 2941.999
corporate situation that has too much

2938.729 --> 2944.46
power necessarily because of the the

2941.999 --> 2949.8289999999997
yeah the financial advantages that have

2944.46 --> 2952.71
been bloating upon so on the long run

2949.829 --> 2955.8590000000004
this may be good if everything responds

2952.71 --> 2958.799
properly and that's gonna be the

2955.859 --> 2961.0789999999997
difficulty so yeah that is my story on

2958.799 --> 2964.529
top of the disappointment of freaking

2961.079 --> 2965.94
shipping costs doubling but yeah I think

2964.529 --> 2968.4
that on the long run it might do

2965.94 --> 2970.469
something good and in a way I really

2968.4 --> 2977.369
hope that in the Netherlands there will

2970.469 --> 2980.21
be more for example health product being

2977.369 --> 2984.109
made produced

2980.21 --> 2986.329
and yeah locally how about that that

2984.109 --> 2988.49
would be really awesome I'd like to see

2986.329 --> 2993.65
some of these these awesome health

2988.49 --> 2995.66
products being produced here not

2993.65 --> 2997.339
enhanced by a bunch of freaks that are

2995.66 --> 3001.24
just gonna pharmaceutical eyes it

2997.339 --> 3005.7599999999998
eventually so that might be something

3001.24 --> 3008.41
that I would be willing to try to do

3005.76 --> 3012.13
although yet to do it on that level

3008.41 --> 3018.3999999999996
requires pretty extreme finances so

3012.13 --> 3021.599
it'll be a late-term thing for me love

3018.4 --> 3028.329
to try it out because I love to like

3021.599 --> 3031.589
like be like a supplement tinkerer I

3028.329 --> 3034.809
love it love the idea of that love it

3031.589 --> 3041.2599999999998
with high-tech equipment will be so

3034.809 --> 3043.48
awesome and already have kind of ideas

3041.26 --> 3047.7700000000004
what I've doesn't even gonna say them

3043.48 --> 3049.9900000000002
public just gonna keep it to myself but

3047.77 --> 3056.95
who knows maybe I will start out with to

3049.99 --> 3059.6499999999996
wear a coffee hmm so anyway I must

3056.95 --> 3063.819
started yeah I did start a little late

3059.65 --> 3066.01
though oh well but I think I'm gonna

3063.819 --> 3068.64
round out the show anyway sorry for

3066.01 --> 3068.6400000000003
