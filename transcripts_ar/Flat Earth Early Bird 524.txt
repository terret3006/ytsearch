whether to put on the sweater or not I

141.379 --> 148.60999999999999
just went with no sweater because I

144.62 --> 150.14000000000001

167.9 --> 172.549

bear yeah good to see you all

207.88 --> 214.989
it's Thursday the 30th April 2020

217.0 --> 224.06
all right it's nice to see like people

220.849 --> 225.82899999999998
rolling into the membership system I'm

224.06 --> 227.78
not sure where it's gonna go yet but I

225.829 --> 230.329
think we're gonna have some fun together

227.78 --> 232.88
with it I'm going to try to do that

230.329 --> 234.739
anyway you're inside don't have don't

232.88 --> 236.91899999999998
you have eating yes I do have eating a

234.739 --> 236.919
bit

238.91 --> 243.82
that's the weird thing I kind did put on

242.51 --> 251.69
a heater

243.82 --> 256.15999999999997
and it's pretty Pleasant like this right

251.69 --> 259.81
anyway yeah I was on earlier in chat

256.16 --> 262.19
about it looks a pure breeze thing

259.81 --> 264.56
because rats to point out of me that

262.19 --> 268.82
it's like a discounted over it didn't

264.56 --> 272.21
for a war store oh no right but yeah I'm

268.82 --> 275.15
having some weird issues with them like

272.21 --> 276.85999999999996
technical issues like it it seems to run

275.15 --> 280.09999999999997
into a dead end when I try to order

276.86 --> 281.56
something so I'll I'll phone them later

280.1 --> 286.64000000000004
on and try again

281.56 --> 288.5
but yeah I'm it's basically because yeah

286.64 --> 289.4
that makes it so cheap that I could go

288.5 --> 295.64
for it right now

289.4 --> 300.79999999999995
and I guess it's not the the system that

295.64 --> 306.44
I kind of had in mind but yeah I think

300.8 --> 308.99
that it's I just need to get it and not

306.44 --> 311.0
try to aim for for the more expensive

308.99 --> 312.77
one because it's just not gonna work out

311.0 --> 315.74
I think it's too many other things

312.77 --> 317.59999999999997
involved too many other financial issues

315.74 --> 322.91
that are kind of now pressing on me from

317.6 --> 325.25
the other side it's still doing okay

322.91 --> 329.48
though but I could definitely use some

325.25 --> 336.74
more support get rid of these stupid

329.48 --> 340.82
bills sure water filtered yes it is

336.74 --> 343.43
Robin Stanley I got a a a big berkey

340.82 --> 348.46999999999997
water filter system from a long time ago

343.43 --> 352.79
in 2008 I bought that but I bought it

348.47 --> 355.1
from somebody that now it was the bare

352.79 --> 358.76000000000005
Coffelt system right it's the English

355.1 --> 361.58000000000004
system no wait it's not ah it's a weird

358.76 --> 364.46
situation back like 10 years ago 12

361.58 --> 367.15999999999997
years ago now there was somebody in the

364.46 --> 369.65
Netherlands that did buy up a lot of

367.16 --> 371.249
these systems and then like it became

369.65 --> 373.229
myself the

371.249 --> 376.97900000000004
tributary of them in the Netherlands and

373.229 --> 379.37899999999996
he had a big berkey system like was

376.979 --> 381.029
relatively expensive in the tough to get

379.379 --> 383.09900000000005
because there are only in America

381.029 --> 387.359
they're like really big tanks like

383.099 --> 389.549
bigger sized tanks I got one because I

387.359 --> 391.049
got two by the way the other one I gave

389.549 --> 392.81899999999996
it to my dad pretty much and he's

391.049 --> 395.669
enjoying that one it's it's the standard

392.819 --> 397.709
size small one that is the standard

395.669 --> 400.469
burqa felt that you can even buy from

397.709 --> 402.359
England because they have that model you

400.469 --> 407.039
know technically burqa kind of told

402.359 --> 409.349
their model from them it's a tank you

407.039 --> 412.61899999999997
know that's it it's just a tank so yeah

409.349 --> 414.80899999999997
copyright yeah I don't know I don't

412.619 --> 417.02900000000005
really care too much I'm using a burka

414.809 --> 420.689
felts tank a bigger one and I use

417.029 --> 424.55899999999997
special filters the it's a complex

420.689 --> 426.839
filter it's basically ceramics on the

424.559 --> 429.23900000000003
outside it has its impregnated with

426.839 --> 432.329
silver it has all kinds of thingies in

429.239 --> 434.219
in the middle and it's great and it's

432.329 --> 438.629
last forever practically so I've been

434.219 --> 441.449
using that for for over a decade and I

438.629 --> 446.03900000000004
never drink from a tap or cook with

441.449 --> 449.189
water from a tap never I don't even give

446.039 --> 452.489
my plants water from a tap I don't even

449.189 --> 455.84900000000005
get the birds water from tap no but

452.489 --> 458.089
because there's water aplenty with that

455.849 --> 458.089
thing

462.139 --> 472.259
delvis Watson what's the name of them

464.569 --> 475.53000000000003
well I think that the what is it in for

472.259 --> 478.259
words also has them but you can probably

475.53 --> 479.90999999999997
look a lot of Infowars products that are

478.259 --> 482.19
really good you can just go to the

479.91 --> 485.34000000000003
company directly and if you really don't

482.19 --> 491.9
want to buy it through Alex Jones I get

485.34 --> 491.9
it you know but hold on let me

507.499 --> 511.939
water and our filtration what is it

510.979 --> 515.36
what's it called

511.939 --> 517.519
yeah the it's also the same company I

515.36 --> 520.759
think the Alexa procure water filtration

517.519 --> 522.949
system it is a really good system and I

520.759 --> 524.839
think that they have like these short

522.949 --> 527.5089999999999
cups types of filters and they're

524.839 --> 529.5500000000001
effectively the same as the type of

527.509 --> 532.759
system I use they're probably even a

529.55 --> 534.4699999999999
little bit more efficient so I think

532.759 --> 538.129
that's a good one and it's really

534.47 --> 541.97
they're really cheap I'm looking at one

538.129 --> 544.009
right now it's to two hundred and forty

541.97 --> 547.1600000000001
dollars pretty much that comes with

544.009 --> 550.129
fillers so that's a good deal

547.16 --> 555.68
mine cost me like five hundred euros

550.129 --> 558.16
back then because it is yeah that wasn't

555.68 --> 563.4799999999999
a time that it was kind of like rare

558.16 --> 565.91
hard to get I'm still it was so much

563.48 --> 569.12
worth the investment because yeah this

565.91 --> 571.069
the tanks literally last forever unless

569.12 --> 573.589
you like to squash them or something by

571.069 --> 575.81
accident drive over them and that they

573.589 --> 579.61
literally just last forever and the

575.81 --> 579.6099999999999
filters last incredibly long as well

582.71 --> 585.339
right

592.96 --> 598.44
all right Missouri bear you can do that

606.08 --> 617.19
okay right anyway if anybody's out there

612.44 --> 620.1
that is willing to help me out again for

617.19 --> 621.6600000000001
the air filter system my plan is kind of

620.1 --> 624.66
adapted I still have to work on my

621.66 --> 626.28
GoFundMe to kind of change that oh yeah

624.66 --> 628.86
I'm not getting a lot of tension from my

626.28 --> 630.75
GoFundMe I don't know why I just put it

628.86 --> 633.0600000000001
out there just as a notice basically

630.75 --> 636.09
like this is a project I need financial

633.06 --> 640.64
help for and we're doing it through

636.09 --> 644.76
PayPal mostly I think ooh thank you wow

640.64 --> 652.04
dude but mine warped that's a lot of

644.76 --> 656.13
super chat but it's not gonna help me it

652.04 --> 661.56
please I try to explain it earlier the

656.13 --> 663.87
thank you sits thank you but it's gonna

661.56 --> 666.42
be detracted from my social welfare so

663.87 --> 671.1
I'm effectively not gonna get it it's

666.42 --> 679.14
gonna look good on my score but yeah but

671.1 --> 685.2
I still appreciate it man thank you very

679.14 --> 689.93
generous they must be doing good glad to

685.2 --> 689.9300000000001
see that how much will you get

691.46 --> 701.01
effectively well from that big donation

694.05 --> 704.91
maybe 20 of that maybe but it's gonna

701.01 --> 708.06
come kind of late see that's that's the

704.91 --> 710.9699999999999
issue it's just most of it yeah a big

708.06 --> 714.9
chunk goes to Google of course like 30%

710.97 --> 716.64
and the rest of it gets on top of the

714.9 --> 719.31
advertisement money and everything I get

716.64 --> 721.92
and then when I get that I have to

719.31 --> 723.6899999999999
report it to my government because I'm

721.92 --> 728.79
on social welfare and so one thing that

723.69 --> 733.5300000000001
it can yeah just I have to and then they

728.79 --> 736.06
take like 95 percent something out of it

733.53 --> 738.85
again it's

736.06 --> 747.64
it's the unfortunate consequence of my

738.85 --> 753.76
setup here yeah I know I saw I tried to

747.64 --> 756.97
tell you earlier like the if you really

753.76 --> 761.14
want to help me directly I know I know

756.97 --> 765.94
okay so for that probably get like 30

761.14 --> 768.01
but the thing is if you really want to

765.94 --> 771.25
help me in a direct way so that I can

768.01 --> 776.77
literally get all of it then send it to

771.25 --> 780.63
PayPal but I get it if you kind of if

776.77 --> 784.77
you ran out so don't worry about it

780.63 --> 784.77
don't worry about it thanks man

785.32 --> 788.359

832.329 --> 845.05
a weird situation here I don't really

834.49 --> 847.3290000000001
know I don't know maybe if I could

845.05 --> 853.4799999999999
refine it let me see if I can find

847.329 --> 857.4699999999999

867.31 --> 873.4799999999999

1106.409 --> 1112.019
apparently she deleted all her past

1108.6 --> 1112.23
videos again I don't know what she's up

1112.019 --> 1116.1200000000001
to

1112.23 --> 1119.73
with that I think it's just her thing

1116.12 --> 1122.25
but it was nice hearing her have a new

1119.73 --> 1125.34
stream and being their jet was a lot of

1122.25 --> 1130.37
fun I know I was like being around in

1125.34 --> 1130.37
their chat and the atmosphere is good

1131.309 --> 1137.7
oh and Benjamin also caught that pretty

1135.63 --> 1142.8300000000002
late though but that was also pretty

1137.7 --> 1145.8300000000002
awesome and right there was a lot about

1142.83 --> 1147.51
height supremacy and then like this mega

1145.83 --> 1154.01
synchronicity moment it was pretty

1147.51 --> 1156.899
special I think yeah must have been

1154.01 --> 1160.039
because he did technically like rip open

1156.899 --> 1162.539
the ladder but yeah he was talking like

1160.039 --> 1164.25
big bear and the check we're talking

1162.539 --> 1166.529
about the Rogen's and the Rogen's height

1164.25 --> 1168.48
and all that the silliness about that

1166.529 --> 1170.279
literally going through the old pictures

1168.48 --> 1172.5
taking a lot of time and effort to find

1170.279 --> 1175.2
the old pictures again of when that joke

1172.5 --> 1177.72
first started and then he opened up like

1175.2 --> 1181.6200000000001
a new letter and it was literally all

1177.72 --> 1184.799
about the Rogen's and about heights it

1181.62 --> 1187.0189999999998
was like what out of all the letters

1184.799 --> 1190.93
that could have arrived like that that

1187.019 --> 1193.57
was just it's hilarious

1190.93 --> 1195.73
and that kind of [ __ ] happens to me like

1193.57 --> 1201.76
constantly as well so I will study like

1195.73 --> 1203.74
yeah yeah I know the feeling man how's

1201.76 --> 1207.7
it crazy things how they come together

1203.74 --> 1210.55
like crazy I technically I could mention

1207.7 --> 1212.68
like synchronicity [ __ ] every day but I

1210.55 --> 1215.8
just don't do it anymore because it

1212.68 --> 1218.26
almost feels like there's things out

1215.8 --> 1220.3899999999999
there doing it to to be attention

1218.26 --> 1230.95
gravity they somehow figured out the

1220.39 --> 1235.63
trick hey hello hey that was an

1230.95 --> 1239.05
experiment how are you doing good oh

1235.63 --> 1242.1000000000001
yeah I'm doing okay

1239.05 --> 1247.8
oh yeah oh we like oh we love right now

1242.1 --> 1250.51
yeah I'm trying to cool her out how to

1247.8 --> 1253.27
how to get young and that's not working

1250.51 --> 1256.21
but anyway yours yes you're in the back

1253.27 --> 1259.33
there so listen that's okay man it's so

1256.21 --> 1261.76
good I hope you get more than what

1259.33 --> 1263.98
bloody Google take out of our gave me to

1261.76 --> 1266.8
turn but I hope you get more than that

1263.98 --> 1269.38
do you reckon that you only get 30 bucks

1266.8 --> 1272.83
earn about yeah probably

1269.38 --> 1274.99
sorry really yeah man cougar was a scam

1272.83 --> 1279.8799999999999
no no it's not even like that

1274.99 --> 1282.22
no it look it standard that they take 30

1279.88 --> 1285.94
percent outright everybody knows that

1282.22 --> 1288.64
yeah well because which is kind of weird

1285.94 --> 1291.97
because I'm on social welfare like that

1288.64 --> 1294.7900000000002
right it's it's just the truth but

1291.97 --> 1297.1000000000001
because of that they give me money but I

1294.79 --> 1302.5
have to report the income I get from

1297.1 --> 1305.7099999999998
Google okay right but I can I seem to be

1302.5 --> 1308.74
able to completely just get things

1305.71 --> 1309.49
through PayPal and yeah it's just

1308.74 --> 1312.19
working out

1309.49 --> 1314.38
I'd nobody said yeah I haven't gotten

1312.19 --> 1317.92
into trouble for it PayPal is kind of

1314.38 --> 1321.88
working along I try to just keep things

1317.92 --> 1323.5900000000001
tidy and yeah that's so good man but

1321.88 --> 1324.1100000000001
they take my live it out again

1323.59 --> 1328.1899999999998
it's

1324.11 --> 1329.9289999999999
like like if I get like say 200 euros in

1328.19 --> 1332.3300000000002
total from the Google because I had a

1329.929 --> 1334.4
lot of donations then they kind of like

1332.33 --> 1338.21
take a hundred and eighty euros out

1334.4 --> 1340.429
again Jesus really yeah no one ever

1338.21 --> 1346.46
loaded no it's because I'm on welfare

1340.429 --> 1348.47
and technically yeah until or because

1346.46 --> 1350.92
they just do that everyone that's crazy

1348.47 --> 1353.66
it's because I'm technically unemployed

1350.92 --> 1356.0900000000001
sort of this is like it's your great job

1353.66 --> 1358.88
and yeah they take it it's crazy and

1356.09 --> 1362.54
dusty that's a massive chunk really it's

1358.88 --> 1366.2900000000002
so I just gave the whole like a massive

1362.54 --> 1366.799
amount but okay it doesn't matter it

1366.29 --> 1368.87
doesn't matter

1366.799 --> 1371.21
oh I'll just give you money like through

1368.87 --> 1373.9399999999998
PayPal it's all good it doesn't matter

anything no this nice sound okay okay

1682.08 --> 1692.1589999999999
that's that's easier so basically what I

1687.96 --> 1694.82
did is I made this same observation from

1692.159 --> 1699.45
probably about eight minutes up about

1694.82 --> 1702.21
probably it would be about eight years

1699.45 --> 1703.529
ago and then a lot of globe is were

1702.21 --> 1705.269
saying oh can you please give me the

1703.529 --> 1708.0
coordinates and the temperature and

1705.269 --> 1710.49
stuff like that I wasn't able to do to

1708.0 --> 1716.37
do that so I went today and I redid the

1710.49 --> 1719.94
whole thing and this is what I got and I

1716.37 --> 1722.2199999999998
think I got even better start lower down

1719.94 --> 1726.3300000000002
I was about four meters above sea level

1722.22 --> 1730.3990000000001
I got even better stuff than I did when

1726.33 --> 1730.399
I was 8 and is above sea level nice

really really good stuff okay so this is

1734.19 --> 1740.22

clear as day which I shouldn't be able

2944.88 --> 2949.6400000000003
to see this is like 40 kilometers man

2950.81 --> 2963.06
that's crazy right

2953.42 --> 2965.58
maybe it is yeah sure he was here yeah

2963.06 --> 2970.0499999999997
but it's not even just that it's also

2965.58 --> 2971.91
just the whole see what let me tell you

2970.05 --> 2976.5
working on the Bureau of Meteorology

2971.91 --> 2978.45
like the the water is 22 degrees and

2976.5 --> 2984.33
guess guess what the air temperature is

2978.45 --> 2991.68
I don't know 22 degrees 22 degrees that

2984.33 --> 2995.43
so there is no Mirage effect okay no sir

2991.68 --> 3003.29
a mirage according to what well because

2995.43 --> 3007.25
there's no heat there's no so it's it

3003.29 --> 3010.16
was a cold day well it's it's not it's

3007.25 --> 3012.26
not so much a cold day but the the water

3010.16 --> 3016.8999999999996
temperature is the same as the air

3012.26 --> 3020.4500000000003
temperature right okay I get your point

3016.9 --> 3023.57
yeah exactly so when people say oh it's

3020.45 --> 3028.0099999999998
a mirage it's like refraction and stuff

3023.57 --> 3030.7400000000002
like that well no because they're the

3028.01 --> 3035.7400000000002
same right there's no temperature

3030.74 --> 3038.24
layering type of effects no no no less

3035.74 --> 3041.2999999999997
extreme if you want to have a look that

3038.24 --> 3044.72
good to be the bomb website which is

3041.3 --> 3048.44
beat ohem Golf Tour au which is the

3044.72 --> 3051.4399999999996
Australian Bureau of Meteorology

3048.44 --> 3053.839
and they can have a look today I filmed

3051.44 --> 3058.4900000000002
this and they can have a look that the

3053.839 --> 3062.99
the water around here was 22 23 degrees

3058.49 --> 3065.089
and that the air was 22 23 degrees as

3062.99 --> 3070.4599999999996
well all right

3065.089 --> 3073.2799999999997
you're interesting right yeah I'm sorry

3070.46 --> 3076.359
like fully take over you sure I didn't

3073.28 --> 3078.77
mean to do that now that's fine a little

3076.359 --> 3081.3489999999997
concentrated Flat Earth research being

3078.77 --> 3083.569
laid out there is is good you know I

3081.349 --> 3087.8590000000004
kind of appreciate I used to do this a

3083.569 --> 3090.95
lot but man I went so far out of my way

3087.859 --> 3093.52
because like I like I did this like

3090.95 --> 3096.109
every chillin fiddle video like probably

3093.52 --> 3098.869
man like six months ago

3096.109 --> 3100.5499999999997
but then I was getting like the crap

3098.869 --> 3102.38
torn out of me because people like oh

3100.55 --> 3104.329
you can't give him like the exact layout

3102.38 --> 3106.79
of the temperatures and stuff like that

3104.329 --> 3110.569
so I literally went out of my way today

3106.79 --> 3114.41
cuz I had the day of work and um I just

3110.569 --> 3118.7
so much like went out and did this and I

3114.41 --> 3119.99
was so getting bitten I really worked

3118.7 --> 3122.27
really hard for this

3119.99 --> 3125.8689999999997
what do you mean you're still getting

3122.27 --> 3129.74
bitten well because people still think

3125.869 --> 3133.04
it's BS but it's not I do that like I

3129.74 --> 3135.7099999999996
filmed this with my own camera it's just

3133.04 --> 3138.619
I went out of my way and filmed this

3135.71 --> 3140.48
thing yeah but what did I think yes I

3138.619 --> 3142.67
think they're just tricking themselves

3140.48 --> 3146.42
no it is I think that it's just possible

3142.67 --> 3148.339
to especially this issue yeah you can

3146.42 --> 3150.65
see the wind turbine right that's in

3148.339 --> 3154.359
peasant rotland silence should I see

3150.65 --> 3158.06
that from bloody 37 kilometres away

3154.359 --> 3164.0
Jesus tell me to say his name in vain

3158.06 --> 3166.43
but Jesus I shouldn't see the answers

3164.0 --> 3169.94
here's that tower that we were looking

3166.43 --> 3173.72
at that's what you suspect right this is

3169.94 --> 3176.2000000000003
the tower and this is it this is the one

3173.72 --> 3176.2
yeah

3176.42 --> 3188.19
that's the root eat sevens brothers away

3181.13 --> 3190.38
go to Street View again this is what it

3188.19 --> 3193.92
looks like up and they should see her

3190.38 --> 3196.079
when there's a your second so alright so

3193.92 --> 3200.849
this is what it looks like up close this

3196.079 --> 3204.7200000000003
is what it looks like up there yeah that

3200.849 --> 3206.94
kind of matches the proportions yeah in

3204.72 --> 3208.68
the dark part and you know what if you

3206.94 --> 3212.91
want to look like once my lights are

3208.68 --> 3214.44
stopped even see I think yeah but you

3212.91 --> 3216.06
know if you want to look up watch my

3214.44 --> 3219.119
black house from the ground from the

3216.06 --> 3222.599
base there with a yellow guy is thing

3219.119 --> 3223.38
just hard but at 30 meters above sea

3222.599 --> 3225.63
level

3223.38 --> 3229.17
okay see that she doesn't look yellow

3225.63 --> 3231.8900000000003
been there yeah you see that's there

3229.17 --> 3235.2000000000003
this is they always put lighthouses

3231.89 --> 3237.2
above luck on the highest point right of

3235.2 --> 3241.6189999999997
course because it makes sense because

3237.2 --> 3243.6899999999996
yet you have exactly on any concealment

3241.619 --> 3244.26
diffraction effect for as far as

3243.69 --> 3246.69
possible

3244.26 --> 3249.8
that's the whole function example that

3246.69 --> 3254.01
you have it's like the triangulation

3249.8 --> 3256.17
before before the technological age for

3254.01 --> 3258.63
ship fair that's what it'll be

3256.17 --> 3261.7200000000003
triangulation before the big GPS

3258.63 --> 3263.94
satellites but anyway we will screen

3261.72 --> 3266.6899999999996
tells you everything it wasn't there

3263.94 --> 3270.39
before stupid screens tell us I mean the

3266.69 --> 3272.7000000000003
triangulation is not in GPS but what's

3270.39 --> 3275.04
up about that another day but anyway not

3272.7 --> 3279.589
trained yes does kind of work with

3275.04 --> 3282.39
triangulation though but it is your

3279.589 --> 3284.52
triangulation get it that's what it's it

3282.39 --> 3286.819
yeah yeah exactly man that's what I'm

3284.52 --> 3286.819
saying

3288.71 --> 3300.359
just kidding right wait look get wrong

3297.51 --> 3303.9900000000002
with you shaven oh stop hijacking it's a

3300.359 --> 3306.48
what you news for you [ __ ] is it really

3303.99 --> 3310.9399999999996
alright well let's go to Nathan shoe and

3306.48 --> 3310.94
then C we need said

3311.24 --> 3315.0
now I love you

3313.02 --> 3318.66
yeah you like you're probably not the

3315.0 --> 3321.09
mother yeah I appreciate it

3318.66 --> 3323.94
I haven't paid it to attention to chat a

3321.09 --> 3325.77
lot so I ask sorry guys if you thought

3323.94 --> 3328.5
they was a they may be a little bit slow

3325.77 --> 3330.87
I'm not used to doing this anymore a lot

3328.5 --> 3333.84
I mostly was watching as Riley and

3330.87 --> 3336.27
Nathan and Randy were doing this kind of

3333.84 --> 3338.33
thing so for me yeah it's like the first

3336.27 --> 3340.44
time to figure out even how it works

3338.33 --> 3343.7599999999998
because I was never at the hell I'm

3340.44 --> 3346.44
doing that whenever we say sorry as well

3343.76 --> 3347.9700000000003
can I also apologize I didn't mean to

3346.44 --> 3350.28
hijack your show like if there would be

3347.97 --> 3354.93
one inside shot like honestly I'm so

3350.28 --> 3357.36
sorry okay no I appreciate it it's some

3354.93 --> 3359.0099999999998
good flat earth stuff just being laid

3357.36 --> 3360.63
out and I had a good opportunity to

3359.01 --> 3365.0400000000004
really compare the visuals and I

3360.63 --> 3367.17
appreciate that so it was another yeah

3365.04 --> 3369.27
and and again dude thank you for all the

3367.17 --> 3371.16
super chats and all that and really

3371.16 --> 3374.2799999999997
appreciate it

3371.79 --> 3380.22
notice I like how it I kind of turned

3374.28 --> 3381.78
out and yeah you know I'm circus off

3380.22 --> 3385.68
that cake you want to take so much for

3381.78 --> 3387.3
me man it's [ __ ] really no but yeah

3385.68 --> 3390.5099999999998
this this kind of stuff is good you know

3387.3 --> 3393.0
it is Flat Earth early bird so this type

3390.51 --> 3396.2400000000002
of thing it also has its place on my

3393.0 --> 3398.43
show so yeah you can you know ask one

3396.24 --> 3400.22
question before you shut down the show

3398.43 --> 3403.41
okay sure go ahead

3400.22 --> 3407.6899999999996
how much do Google really take from you

3403.41 --> 3407.69
if they're if someone gave me 200 bucks

3409.28 --> 3418.23
66 really yes 30% bloody bastards yeah

3414.99 --> 3420.54
that's Robbie man no you know what it's

3418.23 --> 3424.38
kind of like a corporate socialism type

3420.54 --> 3426.48
setup and I wouldn't technically mind it

3424.38 --> 3429.15
if they weren't also at the same time

3426.48 --> 3431.4
trying to manipulate everyone and censor

3429.15 --> 3434.31
[ __ ] and take functions away for no good

3431.4 --> 3436.56
reasons and let moderators go all

3434.31 --> 3438.9
political you know if they wouldn't do

3436.56 --> 3442.14
that then I wouldn't mind so much then

3438.9 --> 3444.69
it would be like yeah that's the AVI

3442.14 --> 3446.7599999999998
we have to pay to basically uphold the

3444.69 --> 3448.4700000000003
platform we're riding on well with all

3446.76 --> 3450.539
this hassle it becomes really annoying

3448.47 --> 3454.1699999999996
that it's like yeah I now don't really

3450.539 --> 3454.65
want to pay them you know but yeah it's

3454.17 --> 3457.9500000000003
what it is

3454.65 --> 3459.779
and the best I can do is just criticize

3457.95 --> 3461.43
all their flaws and their stupidities

3459.779 --> 3462.23
and hope that they'll do something about

3461.43 --> 3466.529
it

3462.23 --> 3468.63
you know sense then it then I'll leave

3466.529 --> 3472.2
eventually you know but I still have

3468.63 --> 3473.67
some hopes that there are plenty of sane

3472.2 --> 3476.0989999999997
people in the platform that are

3473.67 --> 3478.559
concerned about the bad developments in

3476.099 --> 3481.079
the politicization and and are trying to

3478.559 --> 3483.3590000000004
stop it from exploding because of these

3481.079 --> 3485.4300000000003
nutty people and I'm hoping you know

3483.359 --> 3487.68
what it is be able to manage that's a

3485.43 --> 3490.8289999999997
brilliant that's a brilliant segue

3487.68 --> 3493.5589999999997
people say let's head on to the debate

3490.829 --> 3496.17
and we'll see you there all right
