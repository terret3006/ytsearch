95.759 --> 98.0
least

99.119 --> 103.28
somewhere this night

100.88 --> 105.19999999999999
because it had been continually

103.28 --> 107.6
like that just the entire day in the

evening

108.32 --> 112.55999999999999

110.479 --> 114.479
wind

112.56 --> 116.96000000000001
and i bet there's still a lot of moist

114.479 --> 116.96
in the air

121.119 --> 125.68
including the moist that's coming from

123.119 --> 125.68
that vent

127.119 --> 129.84
right

130.08 --> 137.31900000000002

157.44 --> 160.16
good to see you

168.84 --> 174.8
huh right it is

172.0 --> 175.68
sunday the 28th

174.8 --> 178.48000000000002
of

175.68 --> 179.59900000000002
november 2021

178.48 --> 183.599
yeah

179.599 --> 185.51899999999998
and it was as i was starting this show

183.599 --> 188.39999999999998
i got an ad

185.519 --> 190.959
that kind of like

188.4 --> 194.239
it's pretty astounding i didn't have any

190.959 --> 195.84
sound to it but they just showed visuals

194.239 --> 199.84
and

195.84 --> 199.84
it was basically a political ad

202.8 --> 207.28
yeah against it was like

207.599 --> 213.67999999999998
i'm just perplexed by that i

211.12 --> 216.4
i don't know

213.68 --> 216.4
what to say

216.799 --> 223.36
it was against

219.519 --> 224.959
speaking therapy or something

223.36 --> 226.87900000000002
because

224.959 --> 229.92000000000002
you can't cure

226.879 --> 232.48
lgb yeah l

229.92 --> 236.0
gbt

232.48 --> 237.35999999999999
gayness basically but like what

236.0 --> 239.04
this is

237.36 --> 240.72000000000003
an actual ad

239.04 --> 243.12
and i get to see that

240.72 --> 243.12
thanks

247.68 --> 252.239
i'm just like what

249.68 --> 255.28
that's really an ad

252.239 --> 259.359
holy [Â __Â ]

255.28 --> 259.359
oh my god how dare i try to

259.44 --> 263.04
tell people that

261.04 --> 265.199
gay is a choice and that it has

263.04 --> 266.84000000000003
consequences and that

265.199 --> 270.40000000000003
it's not in the

266.84 --> 271.28
design like it's not optimal

270.4 --> 273.19899999999996
right

271.28 --> 274.79999999999995
that's pretty much it like i'm not even

273.199 --> 276.56
like oh

274.8 --> 278.08
yesterday i made a whole point about

276.56 --> 280.4
like yeah don't

278.08 --> 283.19899999999996
necessarily go after the gays but yeah

280.4 --> 284.63899999999995
there are some legal issues

283.199 --> 286.88
you know

284.639 --> 288.96000000000004
but here's the issues like basically

286.88 --> 290.88
freedom of speech so yeah they want to

288.96 --> 293.84
be all prancy and all that you can't

290.88 --> 295.44
stop them and now i get this ad like how

293.84 --> 298.71999999999997
dare you

295.44 --> 302.56
go after us like i

298.72 --> 302.56
actually try to sort of

304.08 --> 308.84
not go after you and then i get this ad

307.6 --> 312.72
like

308.84 --> 312.71999999999997
what okay

312.96 --> 317.68
hey

314.96 --> 317.68
michael khan

319.6 --> 323.96000000000004
snowing in raw jam hmm

327.759 --> 333.28000000000003
back as far 2017

330.24 --> 338.8
first interview with oakley ha

333.28 --> 341.67999999999995
i have no idea what i was like back then

338.8 --> 345.44
you mean the the first time

341.68 --> 345.44
like on my channel he came on

348.08 --> 352.32
i haven't seen that one back in a long

350.0 --> 354.56
time

352.32 --> 356.24
like a dude i have so much freaking

354.56 --> 360.0
material it's

356.24 --> 361.52
like i can't handle it it's too much

360.0 --> 363.68
also because

361.52 --> 365.919
well to me there's a lot of information

363.68 --> 368.639
in like every single moment it's so

365.919 --> 368.639
condensed and

371.52 --> 375.919
i can

372.56 --> 376.96
well i can zoom in on something

375.919 --> 379.12
you know

376.96 --> 382.31899999999996
but to just go through everything it's

379.12 --> 382.319
like oh my god

393.68 --> 397.52
hey seeking star wars good to see you

402.4 --> 409.4
anything against the bible what are you

405.52 --> 409.4
talking about jeff gassett

429.599 --> 432.71999999999997
we were very shy

434.4 --> 437.84
right but

437.919 --> 442.88
it's also because

440.16 --> 443.91900000000004
like nathan when he came on with me is

442.88 --> 444.96
not

443.919 --> 447.68
it's

444.96 --> 449.68
it's not the same role

447.68 --> 450.96
as when he's like

449.68 --> 452.24
yeah being

450.96 --> 455.599
nathan on

452.24 --> 458.72
fed you know it's different

455.599 --> 458.71999999999997
oh the advert what

459.36 --> 463.599
anything you're right yeah it did

462.16 --> 466.40000000000003
actually also

463.599 --> 466.4
draw that in

467.199 --> 470.8
it's

468.16 --> 470.8
very weird

474.639 --> 477.759
right but anyway yeah i'm stumbling a

476.479 --> 480.96
little

477.759 --> 480.96000000000004
i just like what

481.12 --> 486.16
kind of caught me a bit off guard like

483.68 --> 488.319
literally i was just like getting there

486.16 --> 490.0
get ready and suddenly i see that and

488.319 --> 493.759
it's just like what

490.0 --> 496.0
it totally caught me off guard

493.759 --> 498.40000000000003
ah

496.0 --> 498.4
anyway

500.0 --> 504.639
start of google hangouts it was all new

503.44 --> 505.52
yes

504.639 --> 509.12
and

505.52 --> 511.84
look he is still kind of like that

509.12 --> 515.2
especially if he had some

511.84 --> 520.12
like some breathing room

515.2 --> 520.12
because now he's kind of a busy guy

522.56 --> 525.1999999999999
it's different

527.36 --> 531.6800000000001
but i don't know even i think even that

529.519 --> 532.9590000000001
time i had him on with the early bird

531.68 --> 536.7199999999999
show

532.959 --> 536.7199999999999
like he's also like that

536.88 --> 541.36
it's just with fed he kind of takes on

539.839 --> 543.9200000000001
this role

541.36 --> 546.9590000000001
his function

543.92 --> 546.959
and it's different

547.68 --> 550.4799999999999
and so do i

550.88 --> 557.04
i'm very different

553.839 --> 560.6400000000001
when i'm participating in other shows as

557.04 --> 565.88
when i do my own thing

560.64 --> 565.88
a much less restrained on other places

587.6 --> 591.839
800 pounds towards the peanut

593.6 --> 596.16
inspector

597.04 --> 599.4399999999999
could be

600.72 --> 607.12
but like ruff

603.519 --> 608.9590000000001
is supposedly a very or allegedly a very

607.12 --> 612.0
wealthy man

608.959 --> 615.5999999999999
and he had also like before kind of

612.0 --> 615.6
supported flat earthers

616.0 --> 620.24
he was supporting a whole bunch of

617.519 --> 622.24
people out here

620.24 --> 624.32
like i think i might have even gotten

622.24 --> 626.9590000000001
some money from him in a paypal donation

624.32 --> 628.9590000000001
at one point

626.959 --> 631.8389999999999
so

628.959 --> 634.56
but yeah then after all that after that

631.839 --> 637.12
period yeah there was some weird stuff

634.56 --> 640.16
going on between ranty and ruff and a

637.12 --> 640.16
bunch of other people

641.2 --> 649.12
like right before he turned baller

644.839 --> 649.12
again or anti flat earther

649.2 --> 652.399
yep it's on

650.88 --> 654.72
that's okay

652.399 --> 654.72
huh

656.0 --> 658.959
i should re like does anybody have a

658.16 --> 660.7199999999999
link

658.959 --> 663.04
to bev's channel

660.72 --> 664.1600000000001
i don't think i'm subscribed

663.04 --> 665.92
but i should

664.16 --> 668.16
like it's been

665.92 --> 670.399
catching more attention i should take a

668.16 --> 670.399
look

670.48 --> 674.9200000000001
hey bax good to see you

675.839 --> 682.48
who feel fast food

678.88 --> 684.88
yeah that's dutch for how much fast food

682.48 --> 689.2
does are we eat well that depends on

684.88 --> 693.2
what you consider fast food because i

689.2 --> 693.2
only eat food that i prepare

697.12 --> 701.88
and it's all organic

698.88 --> 701.88
right

702.24 --> 706.64
i even

703.68 --> 709.68
for a time hoped there could be like

706.64 --> 712.3199999999999
fast food organic but like really

709.68 --> 714.7199999999999
organic not just oh it has some organic

712.32 --> 717.839
stuff but just full organic that that

714.72 --> 717.839
could be a thing but

718.639 --> 722.32
yeah with everything that's gone down

720.8 --> 725.4399999999999
now it's

722.32 --> 728.24
blatantly obviously senseless pointless

725.44 --> 728.24
to hope for that

729.839 --> 734.639
best answer

732.399 --> 734.639
okay

737.839 --> 743.32
thought you were trying to show me but

740.0 --> 743.32
that's fine

746.48 --> 751.04
but yeah ironically i do eat a lot of

748.8 --> 753.04
french fries and i do eat pizza these

751.04 --> 757.079
days so

753.04 --> 757.079
but i all make it myself

763.36 --> 767.2
and that that's a lot better

768.72 --> 772.639
because

769.76 --> 775.279
you know what you're

772.639 --> 776.9590000000001
frying in

775.279 --> 778.56
you know the sources

776.959 --> 781.1999999999999
you're literally checking out the

778.56 --> 783.5189999999999
product before it's been

781.2 --> 786.519
heated and all that so you know what it

783.519 --> 786.519
is

789.519 --> 791.839
anyway

792.32 --> 795.6800000000001
do you have fluoride in the water in

794.48 --> 796.5600000000001
that

795.68 --> 800.399
uh

796.56 --> 802.56
no i don't think so

800.399 --> 805.04
unless that suddenly changed but i don't

802.56 --> 805.04
think so

806.32 --> 810.32
there's some

807.839 --> 813.44
regions where there is chlorine

810.32 --> 813.44
in the water i believe

813.6 --> 816.5600000000001
certain

815.44 --> 819.2790000000001
the more

816.56 --> 821.92
the more density regions

819.279 --> 825.639
but no fluoride

821.92 --> 825.639
no sodium fluoride

828.16 --> 832.399
but despite that i still wow

840.959 --> 845.68
takes thousand year old

843.44 --> 848.1600000000001
okay seth

845.68 --> 849.8389999999999
you mean groundwater or something very

848.16 --> 852.079
filtered okay

849.839 --> 852.0790000000001
well

852.88 --> 857.92
i'm surprised at the quality of the

854.959 --> 860.6389999999999
water here for a city

857.92 --> 862.7199999999999
yeah it is pretty good compared to the

860.639 --> 864.72
other bigger cities

862.72 --> 866.24
very happy with that despite that i

864.72 --> 868.32
still use

866.24 --> 871.839
a water filter

868.32 --> 871.839
a ceramic filter

873.44 --> 879.36
and yeah well they're lasting very long

877.6 --> 882.0790000000001
over here right

879.36 --> 884.16
so that that kind of implies that the

882.079 --> 886.16
water quality is pretty good because if

884.16 --> 888.8
it was very dirty

886.16 --> 889.76
they would get saturated with

888.8 --> 892.959
with

889.76 --> 895.6
yeah rubble and dirt and all that and

892.959 --> 898.16
toxic stuff much quicker

895.6 --> 900.88
so

898.16 --> 904.76
best in the world okay

900.88 --> 904.76
that's a big claim

913.04 --> 917.68
okay did you just google that seth

915.519 --> 920.32
willis willowbrook

917.68 --> 920.3199999999999
how do you know

925.44 --> 928.399
near okay

929.6 --> 934.9590000000001
right well overall water quality

933.04 --> 935.68
in tap water quality in the netherlands

934.959 --> 939.3199999999999
is

935.68 --> 939.3199999999999
pretty high standards

942.56 --> 946.2399999999999
i mean there's like a whole government

944.639 --> 948.0790000000001
department

946.24 --> 950.639
government department

948.079 --> 954.68
specifically dedicated to

950.639 --> 954.6800000000001
water works of all sorts

955.6 --> 958.8000000000001
like geographical

958.88 --> 961.12
uh

960.079 --> 962.56
stuff

961.12 --> 965.839
dykes

962.56 --> 967.5999999999999
but also yeah just water management

965.839 --> 969.759
water levels

967.6 --> 973.9200000000001
pumps

969.759 --> 977.36
and i think they're also involved in

973.92 --> 980.0
in the water reserves for drinking water

977.36 --> 982.0
and water quality testing i don't know i

980.0 --> 984.16
think they're probably

982.0 --> 986.0
yeah

984.16 --> 988.0
they do a lot of work so the water

986.0 --> 989.6
quality here is pretty good i don't know

988.0 --> 991.519
if it's if

989.6 --> 994.519
it's like all because of that government

991.519 --> 994.519
department

996.0 --> 999.68
but overall i think

997.759 --> 1002.24
like water quality is just taken very

999.68 --> 1005.2399999999999
serious here

1002.24 --> 1005.24
anyway

1019.6 --> 1024.079
that white stuff

1021.6 --> 1027.319
chalk that's usually just like minerals

1024.079 --> 1027.319
and chalk

1042.4 --> 1048.88
it's like sediment effectively

1046.16 --> 1051.28
like especially when the water is like

1048.88 --> 1054.24
really saturated with a lot of minerals

1051.28 --> 1054.24
you get a lot of it

1055.44 --> 1059.3600000000001
right it's basically the same effect as

1058.16 --> 1062.559
with

1059.36 --> 1065.9189999999999
with caves stalagmites stalactites like

1062.559 --> 1068.24
dripping stones it's the chalk sediment

1065.919 --> 1071.039
now in the shower there's not

1068.24 --> 1071.039
it's different but

1071.36 --> 1074.559
that's why

1072.559 --> 1076.799
why it all gets all chalked up and all

1074.559 --> 1076.799
that

1077.28 --> 1082.72
hard water

1078.84 --> 1082.72
right saturated

1093.2 --> 1099.76
yes okay seth will are you like dutch

1097.039 --> 1103.52
like hey dude who are you

1099.76 --> 1107.64
you seem to know a lot about uh

1103.52 --> 1107.6399999999999
how things operate here

1117.919 --> 1120.919
ah

1142.24 --> 1146.039
hey psych bear

1150.559 --> 1156.32
right so yeah seth you mind if i

1154.0 --> 1157.52
inquire a little further on who you are

1156.32 --> 1162.2
like

1157.52 --> 1162.2
you live here in utrecht as well or

1164.0 --> 1166.24
like

1166.799 --> 1173.44
are you in government like do you work

1169.76 --> 1173.44
for some department like

1173.6 --> 1175.84
don't mind

1174.88 --> 1178.64
at all

1175.84 --> 1181.9189999999999
it's a very interesting actually

1178.64 --> 1183.5200000000002
if you were or you like a student or

1181.919 --> 1185.76
oh you live in zeus

1183.52 --> 1185.76
huh

1187.679 --> 1190.0800000000002
all right

1191.44 --> 1194.799
jobless

1192.4 --> 1199.4
all right

1194.799 --> 1199.4
can i ask like what's your age

1220.0 --> 1223.52
50 years old all right

1224.159 --> 1231.7990000000002
so you've lived in your insust

1228.0 --> 1231.799
all your life or

1250.72 --> 1253.679
huh

1252.4 --> 1254.5590000000002
all right

1253.679 --> 1257.44
well

1254.559 --> 1260.32
then i'm gonna ask you a question

1257.44 --> 1260.3200000000002
do you know me

1260.72 --> 1267.039
because i've lived in zeus for well most

1264.4 --> 1267.039
of my life

1267.36 --> 1271.76
now i'm very bad at people people's

1269.6 --> 1272.9599999999998
names

1271.76 --> 1274.72
but

1272.96 --> 1278.72
like well

1274.72 --> 1282.48
it's not like i look radically different

1278.72 --> 1282.48
oh i have a mustache now

1283.44 --> 1287.3600000000001
but i've pretty much always worn black

1285.76 --> 1288.84
for

1287.36 --> 1292.559
over 20

1288.84 --> 1294.72
years do you know me do you recognize me

1292.559 --> 1294.72
like

1294.799 --> 1298.1589999999999
how did you find this stream

1301.28 --> 1309.12
are you into flat earth or globe or

1304.72 --> 1309.1200000000001
seen you once or long black yeah

1309.679 --> 1313.1200000000001
there's a good chance that was me

1313.44 --> 1317.48
we don't know each other okay

1331.28 --> 1333.84
hmm

1337.12 --> 1342.8799999999999
see i'm not cgi i'm actually a real

1340.08 --> 1345.8799999999999
person somebody witnessed me

1342.88 --> 1345.88
ooh

1348.72 --> 1351.039
huh

1354.08 --> 1357.36
you like my musings

1358.559 --> 1361.559
okay

1363.52 --> 1367.859
wait

1364.78 --> 1367.859
[Music]

1375.919 --> 1378.919
right

1394.24 --> 1399.36
well anyway yeah

1396.24 --> 1399.36
welcome to the chat

1399.919 --> 1406.0
interesting to know somebody

1403.12 --> 1406.0
from my old town

1415.52 --> 1421.9189999999999
i mean like since

1417.12 --> 1425.039
i moved from there 2006

1421.919 --> 1426.96
i haven't been really back like i drove

1425.039 --> 1429.2
past my house a couple of times and

1426.96 --> 1431.039
that's it

1429.2 --> 1433.2
when i was roughly

1431.039 --> 1435.52
in the neighborhood just to take a look

1433.2 --> 1437.76
like hey what what is it now

1435.52 --> 1439.44
because they did change a lot

1437.76 --> 1440.32
pretty much like

1439.44 --> 1442.799
yeah

1440.32 --> 1446.72
murdered like all the wildlife

1442.799 --> 1446.72
all the trees terrible

1453.2 --> 1456.24
hey geoshifter

1456.559 --> 1462.76
but yeah that's what happens when you

1459.36 --> 1462.76
sell your house

1510.96 --> 1513.96
what

1515.6 --> 1518.7199999999998
like

1516.4 --> 1521.039
what are you talking about seeking star

1518.72 --> 1521.039
wars

1523.84 --> 1527.32
what's an ro

1549.919 --> 1552.24
oh

1553.36 --> 1556.9599999999998
right

1555.36 --> 1561.0
talking about the water filters again

1556.96 --> 1561.0
yeah yeah okay now i understand

1575.039 --> 1578.039
do

1590.72 --> 1594.64
did i listen to professor phil on

1593.2 --> 1599.4
mitchell's channel

1594.64 --> 1599.4
yeah i was there live when he came in

1601.44 --> 1604.96
yeah

1602.88 --> 1608.88
well you know at least

1604.96 --> 1608.88
at least they're sort of trying now

1609.919 --> 1615.44
i think that my baldwin act

1613.2 --> 1617.679
may have actually inspired them a little

1615.44 --> 1617.679
to

1618.88 --> 1623.279
to go for it

1620.24 --> 1623.279
even though it is all

1623.44 --> 1627.279
quite

1624.4 --> 1631.279
bizarre at this point

1627.279 --> 1631.279
but yet they're still kind of like

1632.08 --> 1637.4399999999998
they're still in the orienting phase of

1634.799 --> 1638.8799999999999
their machination

1637.44 --> 1640.88
so

1638.88 --> 1644.88
but it's starting to

1640.88 --> 1648.7990000000002
get somewhere virtually cohesive

1644.88 --> 1648.7990000000002
but it still has a long way to go

1650.88 --> 1656.5590000000002
yeah and it's never going to be more

1652.24 --> 1656.559
than virtually cohesive of course but

1659.52 --> 1663.52
right if baldwin can do it so can we

1665.52 --> 1668.72
yeah

1666.399 --> 1671.4399999999998
and that's a joke but it's also not a

1668.72 --> 1673.44
joke and that makes things

1671.44 --> 1677.3990000000001
weird

1673.44 --> 1677.3990000000001
that's the way i like it

1691.12 --> 1694.4799999999998
right but i don't want to like

1695.679 --> 1701.2
give the ballers like everything

1698.48 --> 1702.559
like it was already kind of

1701.2 --> 1704.3990000000001
burdensome

1702.559 --> 1706.559
going as far as i did

1704.399 --> 1708.6399999999999
with ballwin at certain moments like i

1706.559 --> 1710.48
really laid out basically the in the

1708.64 --> 1711.76
virtual infrastructure of trainer

1710.48 --> 1713.84
thinking

1711.76 --> 1715.36
that i've been seeing

1713.84 --> 1717.52
for a long time

1715.36 --> 1723.6399999999999
it's like a blossom

1717.52 --> 1723.6399999999999
of an idea that rumpus originally seated

1724.08 --> 1726.399
uh

1728.64 --> 1733.279
terrestrial refraction it's genius

1734.159 --> 1740.48
and it's not perfect but that makes it

1737.279 --> 1741.919
very tannable because look at all the

1740.48 --> 1743.3600000000001
other machinations within the

1741.919 --> 1744.96
heliocentric

1743.36 --> 1746.8799999999999
thinking

1744.96 --> 1750.3990000000001
those are

1746.88 --> 1750.3990000000001
on the same level they are

1750.48 --> 1756.159
like obviously not

1753.36 --> 1758.32
like solid they're not complete but they

1756.159 --> 1759.3600000000001
are somewhat cohesive to a certain

1758.32 --> 1761.6789999999999
degree

1759.36 --> 1764.32
like you can do things with it

1761.679 --> 1769.919
and terrestrial refraction

1764.32 --> 1771.52
i think is like the logical next step

1769.919 --> 1774.7990000000002
to avoid

1771.52 --> 1778.08
the the revolution in optics

1774.799 --> 1778.08
and tools for that

1778.159 --> 1781.8400000000001
they have to now basically concede you

1780.32 --> 1784.399
can't use

1781.84 --> 1787.399
optics to determine the geometry of

1784.399 --> 1787.399
earth

1800.96 --> 1803.96
so

1816.32 --> 1820.08
yeah i get to inspect yeah jim bob's

1818.159 --> 1824.7600000000002
doing great

1820.08 --> 1824.76
i i try to catch every stream

1843.12 --> 1845.36
what

1845.76 --> 1851.2
it launched five days ago will take 10

1848.159 --> 1851.2
months to get down

1852.0 --> 1855.0
okay

1894.72 --> 1898.159
a professor wouldn't talk to or be a

1897.12 --> 1900.799
troll

1898.159 --> 1903.1200000000001
well jeff gas had

1900.799 --> 1906.12
like of technically it would be

1903.12 --> 1906.12
unprofessional

1906.24 --> 1911.84
pun intended

1907.76 --> 1911.84
but also literal the way you like it

1913.2 --> 1917.279
it's kind of unprofessional for a

1915.279 --> 1918.84
professor a teacher

1917.279 --> 1921.039
to

1918.84 --> 1922.32
yeah to

1921.039 --> 1925.039
to

1922.32 --> 1927.6789999999999
to act like that

1925.039 --> 1930.399
like especially the the social

1927.679 --> 1933.2
peer pressure based tactics is just very

1930.399 --> 1936.1589999999999
unbecoming for a teacher

1933.2 --> 1936.159
that has class

1942.799 --> 1947.08
getting a crash helmet what

1953.12 --> 1957.32
this guy is falling what

1964.399 --> 1966.799
come on

1971.039 --> 1976.32
you know that like all the meteor talk

1973.36 --> 1978.0
it's all just make-believe right all of

1976.32 --> 1980.399
that

1978.0 --> 1982.64
i mean yeah sometimes

1980.399 --> 1984.8799999999999
visually

1982.64 --> 1985.919
we experience weird [Â __Â ] where there

1984.88 --> 1988.72
seems like

1985.919 --> 1988.72
some glitter

1988.88 --> 1994.3990000000001
like almost like fireworks glittery

1991.44 --> 1996.3200000000002
stone suddenly comes down

1994.399 --> 1998.799
sometimes really close

1996.32 --> 2000.48
sometimes really big and far away and

1998.799 --> 2003.2
explodes we've seen those videos

2000.48 --> 2005.679
although i've never seen it

2003.2 --> 2007.8400000000001
beyond those videos

2005.679 --> 2010.0
but i have witnessed plenty of like

2007.84 --> 2012.8799999999999
falling stars that

2010.0 --> 2015.36
are not just holographic effects and

2012.88 --> 2016.88
that's like really bizarre to me

2015.36 --> 2019.6789999999999
like what

2016.88 --> 2021.3600000000001
but that's about it all the talk of

2019.679 --> 2023.8400000000001
meteors

2021.36 --> 2026.24
big asteroids you know we have to do all

2023.84 --> 2029.1999999999998
this stuff

2026.24 --> 2030.96
let's reenact the movie armageddon

2029.2 --> 2033.8400000000001
that's all gonna be nonsense every

2030.96 --> 2033.8400000000001
single time

2034.0 --> 2040.799
it's just sci-fi busying therapy

2037.6 --> 2042.9599999999998
although yeah is it really therapeutical

2040.799 --> 2045.44
to be all worried about that

2042.96 --> 2047.519
and get all dramatic

2045.44 --> 2051.0
yeah

2047.519 --> 2051.0
it's a debatable

2078.96 --> 2085.52
level earth observer yeah

2081.839 --> 2085.52
i might subscribe to the guy

2087.2 --> 2091.3199999999997
kind of have seen him around

2104.24 --> 2106.4799999999996
yeah

2106.8 --> 2110.32
i am subscribed okay

2113.52 --> 2119.52
all right he has a video

2117.119 --> 2122.079
every half a week or something or every

2119.52 --> 2122.079
week so

2127.359 --> 2132.0789999999997
that's weird i don't remember seeing the

2129.599 --> 2135.04
notifications for those videos maybe it

2132.079 --> 2139.5600000000004
was like in a whole crowded

2135.04 --> 2139.56
moment and i just overlooked it

2154.0 --> 2159.32
his youtube is taken down what

2164.56 --> 2167.44
this short clip is

2169.92 --> 2175.079
right yeah that's

2171.76 --> 2175.079
his channel

2258.24 --> 2261.3999999999996
all right

2292.64 --> 2298.2
huh

2294.72 --> 2298.2
what's this

2308.64 --> 2311.96
all right

2318.8 --> 2324.4
right yeah i think that the guys

2321.04 --> 2326.64
are organizing like the fed guys

2324.4 --> 2328.48
which i'm a part of but i don't really

2326.64 --> 2331.1189999999997
get involved too much in like these

2328.48 --> 2334.0
mechanical arguments

2331.119 --> 2337.44
like the big moves against

2334.0 --> 2340.56
anti-flat earthers and all that

2337.44 --> 2343.28
i kind of like work on the other side

2340.56 --> 2346.24
as a sparring partner

2343.28 --> 2350.7200000000003
mostly but i think they're like making a

2346.24 --> 2350.72
a real move using the sexton and the

2351.44 --> 2355.839
yeah the whole angle argument

2356.24 --> 2360.0789999999997
they're really going for that and even

2357.839 --> 2363.52
though i've sort of virtually figured

2360.079 --> 2364.6400000000003
out a way beyond that like

2363.52 --> 2366.56
yeah

2364.64 --> 2368.16
if you don't believe in the machinations

2366.56 --> 2369.2799999999997
yeah then they're totally caught so

2368.16 --> 2372.96
anyway

2369.28 --> 2372.96
there's a move going on

2374.56 --> 2378.88
and we'll see what happens

2376.88 --> 2380.839
how are the ballers gonna twist their

2378.88 --> 2385.04
way around this

2380.839 --> 2385.04
one only time will tell

2387.04 --> 2390.72
i've already given my example

2403.2 --> 2406.2
so

2417.599 --> 2419.92
okay

2421.359 --> 2426.0789999999997
uh while seeking star wars the link of

2423.839 --> 2429.599
the channel you gave me is not the same

2426.079 --> 2429.599
link as guided inspector

2430.4 --> 2435.28
so we might be talking about

2433.2 --> 2438.68
a channel that is like roughly the same

2435.28 --> 2438.6800000000003
name or something

2454.48 --> 2459.96
hey boot working gunny bear good to see

2456.96 --> 2459.96
you

2496.4 --> 2498.7200000000003
huh

2499.119 --> 2504.7200000000003
okay what's he stop maybe that's like

2502.319 --> 2508.88
did he have multiple channels and that

2504.72 --> 2510.7999999999997
one happens to be banned

2508.88 --> 2514.04
i don't know

2510.8 --> 2514.04
this is

2523.68 --> 2530.0
oh yeah man

2526.319 --> 2530.0
jaron uploaded this video

2530.72 --> 2535.2799999999997
last night

2533.28 --> 2537.6800000000003
about how jake

2535.28 --> 2540.079
the [Â __Â ] got his name

2537.68 --> 2542.319
like oh man i'd forgotten about that

2540.079 --> 2545.319
that was just

2542.319 --> 2545.319
yeah

2561.68 --> 2565.839
hello professor phil bell

2587.28 --> 2591.96
oh yeah i was also watching a bit of

2588.96 --> 2591.96
dell

2595.119 --> 2600.079
beyond the imaginary curve i still find

2597.2 --> 2602.48
it very interesting sometimes

2600.079 --> 2605.599
like if you can attune to his frequency

2602.48 --> 2607.52
it's really interesting

2605.599 --> 2610.8
if you can't then it's just like what

2607.52 --> 2613.359
the hell is this scotsman babbling about

2610.8 --> 2614.88
but if you actually character tuned into

2613.359 --> 2616.72
his frequency then it's really

2614.88 --> 2619.7200000000003
interesting

2616.72 --> 2619.72
sometimes

2628.72 --> 2633.48
yeah exactly bill nye science denier

2634.319 --> 2639.44
yeah it it's it was

2636.4 --> 2639.44
very repulsive

2646.079 --> 2652.7200000000003
almost as disgusting as to be what

2650.319 --> 2652.72
okay

2659.599 --> 2663.1600000000003
hey good servant

2691.119 --> 2694.7200000000003
right yeah well george sanford it's not

2693.52 --> 2695.599
really

2694.72 --> 2697.839
fair

2695.599 --> 2698.7200000000003
to compare it right

2697.839 --> 2700.88
because

2698.72 --> 2704.9599999999996
i'm pretty sure that jake never

2700.88 --> 2707.28
apologized like overtly

2704.96 --> 2710.079
like he made a point that he was stood

2707.28 --> 2711.52
behind him being like that

2710.079 --> 2715.599
right

2711.52 --> 2717.04
pretty sure it's like his shtick

2715.599 --> 2720.1600000000003
but

2717.04 --> 2723.119
i'm also pretty sure that uh jaren and

2720.16 --> 2726.24
the guys have definitely addressed

2723.119 --> 2728.48
the situation and real enough given like

2726.24 --> 2731.9199999999996
admission that they realize like yeah

2728.48 --> 2734.48
that wasn't really our brightest moment

2731.92 --> 2738.28
so that's not the same it's not really

2734.48 --> 2738.28
fair to compare that

2747.359 --> 2750.359
um

2770.16 --> 2773.16
eh

2774.0 --> 2781.88
and wolfie is still at it is he

2777.44 --> 2781.88
oh dear oh dear oh there

2789.28 --> 2795.239
what about

2792.13 --> 2795.239
[Music]

2826.16 --> 2829.16
wow

2840.16 --> 2847.44
the math works all over the earth

2843.68 --> 2847.44
oh my god i have to show that

2855.92 --> 2861.48
oh my god that's so hilarious i gotta

2858.24 --> 2861.4799999999996
show this

2879.839 --> 2885.16
yeah that should suffice

2881.76 --> 2885.1600000000003
check it out

2886.0 --> 2889.119
that's in this video

2890.24 --> 2893.4799999999996
so hilarious

2901.44 --> 2904.44
hmm

2919.28 --> 2924.2400000000002
right for any

2922.0 --> 2927.2
eager flat earthers

2924.24 --> 2929.839
to go at it with wolfies

2927.2 --> 2933.5989999999997
latest video i think it's

2929.839 --> 2935.359
i think it's just the same typical

2933.599 --> 2938.2400000000002
garbage

2935.359 --> 2938.24
here's the video

2938.559 --> 2943.76
because a

2939.76 --> 2948.6400000000003
random baller brought it up

2943.76 --> 2948.6400000000003
thank you frank deb drebin

2948.72 --> 2954.319
for reminding us of

2951.119 --> 2956.079
wolfie's latest video from a day ago

2954.319 --> 2959.599
woohoo

2956.079 --> 2961.76
math2 complexes

2959.599 --> 2964.1600000000003
well usually when the math is too

2961.76 --> 2966.1600000000003
complex

2964.16 --> 2968.64
means

2966.16 --> 2972.5589999999997
it's overcompensating for systemic

2968.64 --> 2973.5989999999997
issues which means the premise is wrong

2972.559 --> 2974.96
yeah i

2973.599 --> 2978.0
don't have to be

2974.96 --> 2981.4
good at math to know that

2978.0 --> 2981.4
about math

2996.64 --> 2999.64
hmm

3013.2 --> 3017.9199999999996
right so anything else i'm not really

3015.04 --> 3019.119
gonna dig into the details unless frank

3017.92 --> 3022.319
drabin

3019.119 --> 3026.0
wants to share us the

3022.319 --> 3027.599
well the math i guess

3026.0 --> 3030.16
or it would better if he would be able

3027.599 --> 3033.28
to explain

3030.16 --> 3036.3999999999996
like describe it not literally

3033.28 --> 3036.4
show us formulas

3039.44 --> 3044.16
as in can you translate the math to a

3042.0 --> 3047.16
just a verbal description that would be

3044.16 --> 3047.16
great

3091.119 --> 3096.96
what opposite side of this what are you

3094.079 --> 3100.1600000000003
talking about opposite side of the sun

3096.96 --> 3100.16
woodworking gunny bear

3105.44 --> 3109.2000000000003
i didn't know the sun had sides

3109.28 --> 3117.7200000000003
that kind of implies a

3111.76 --> 3117.7200000000003
cartesian or euclidean position in space

3127.599 --> 3132.6400000000003
can the height of the sun be calculated

3130.319 --> 3136.16
well if you can confirm an actual

3132.64 --> 3138.8799999999997
euclidean position or cartesian

3136.16 --> 3141.359
yeah then

3138.88 --> 3143.359
then you might actually apply all that

3141.359 --> 3144.96
and you might calculate the actual

3143.359 --> 3148.5589999999997
height but

3144.96 --> 3151.76
first you have to establish that

3148.559 --> 3154.48
there is an actual position and that

3151.76 --> 3157.2000000000003
it abides

3154.48 --> 3160.48
by the laws of being a thing or an

3157.2 --> 3162.7999999999997
apparent thing in an actual position

3160.48 --> 3164.64
because as far as i've seen

3162.8 --> 3167.8390000000004
it's only an apparent thing in an

3164.64 --> 3167.839
apparent position

3168.16 --> 3172.96
not an actual position

3170.24 --> 3174.9599999999996
right originally even before i like

3172.96 --> 3176.48
really put down the whole holographic

3174.96 --> 3179.76
concept

3176.48 --> 3182.319
elaborated on it it was kind of like

3179.76 --> 3185.28
on the other edges debated like yeah but

3182.319 --> 3187.359
maybe it is just this

3185.28 --> 3190.48
apparent like this electrical light

3187.359 --> 3190.48
thing in a position

3190.559 --> 3194.4
like

3192.64 --> 3197.1189999999997
you can go through it

3194.4 --> 3199.6800000000003
it doesn't really do anything but

3197.119 --> 3201.92
it has that position like that wasn't an

3199.68 --> 3204.0789999999997
idea originally and i'm talking like

3201.92 --> 3206.48
2016

3204.079 --> 3208.88
on the fringes of the flat earther

3206.48 --> 3210.559
speculation in back rooms

3208.88 --> 3212.4
but

3210.559 --> 3214.3190000000004
yeah

3212.4 --> 3216.8
that kind of all

3214.319 --> 3218.319
dropped to the back

3216.8 --> 3220.7200000000003
for most people

3218.319 --> 3222.5589999999997
and i'm still not convinced that there

3220.72 --> 3225.52
is any kind of

3222.559 --> 3227.119
actual position to any of the apparent

3225.52 --> 3230.24
phenomena

3227.119 --> 3230.2400000000002
of the celestials

3234.0 --> 3240.48
path of the sun

3236.48 --> 3240.48
yeah but the path is only apparent

3243.359 --> 3248.839
it's not actually

3245.2 --> 3252.72
in a literal path which would

3248.839 --> 3256.92
require cartesian position over the flat

3252.72 --> 3256.9199999999996
earth that's not what's happening

3267.76 --> 3273.5200000000004
the height of what we see yeah but

3270.0 --> 3275.44
how do you know the height

3273.52 --> 3276.839
that would be assuming

3275.44 --> 3280.4
an actual

3276.839 --> 3283.599
location there is no height

3280.4 --> 3283.599
there's only an angle

3288.0 --> 3292.48
creepuscular rays

3290.0 --> 3293.2
and even crepuscular rays are part of

3292.48 --> 3295.359
the

3293.2 --> 3298.0
non-local effect

3295.359 --> 3299.7599999999998
it's like the holographic

3298.0 --> 3302.0
the holographics

3299.76 --> 3304.559
when unleashed on like physical

3302.0 --> 3304.559
obstacles

3305.359 --> 3310.0
well one person will see crepuscular

3307.599 --> 3311.52
rays coming through a cloud like right

3310.0 --> 3313.68
in front of them

3311.52 --> 3316.72
another person will look at the same

3313.68 --> 3319.44
cloud but the sun to them is not behind

3316.72 --> 3322.0789999999997
that cloud and he doesn't see the race

3319.44 --> 3322.079
coming through it

3324.48 --> 3327.76
not in the same way maybe some race but

3326.88 --> 3329.599
not

3327.76 --> 3332.88
on the same locations as the first

3329.599 --> 3332.88
person it's all holographic

3333.76 --> 3337.88
there is no actual position

3352.88 --> 3357.6800000000003
right so yeah you can use math

3356.24 --> 3360.0789999999997
just like the ballers do with their

3357.68 --> 3363.5989999999997
heliocentric conceptions you can use

3360.079 --> 3365.3590000000004
math to presuppose a very specific

3363.599 --> 3367.52
disc

3365.359 --> 3370.319
orientation

3367.52 --> 3373.2
which would correlate with roughly

3370.319 --> 3374.319
with the solar angles and

3373.2 --> 3377.52
then

3374.319 --> 3380.48
those can pan out to be

3377.52 --> 3382.96
in like this circle over a disk it's a

3380.48 --> 3382.96
model

3383.119 --> 3387.28
but

3384.24 --> 3390.9199999999996
the sun and the moon are not actually

3387.28 --> 3390.92
literally there

3391.44 --> 3396.88
like you can't go

3394.319 --> 3398.64
towards it and then literally approach

3396.88 --> 3401.44
this light

3398.64 --> 3401.44
it doesn't happen

3402.559 --> 3406.2400000000002
they don't have actual positions

3411.52 --> 3416.359
did my mic die no that's you

3469.359 --> 3474.5589999999997
right so i hope that clarifies some

3471.68 --> 3478.48
woodworking gunny bear

3474.559 --> 3481.3590000000004
i overall do appreciate your input

3478.48 --> 3483.119
but you are or you seem to be engaging

3481.359 --> 3485.119
in the

3483.119 --> 3487.52
speculation

3485.119 --> 3488.96
of actual sun and moon positions over

3487.52 --> 3491.28
the flat earth

3488.96 --> 3493.28
and well there's issues with that as

3491.28 --> 3495.28
i've been trying to describe i hope you

3493.28 --> 3499.3590000000004
understand my point

3495.28 --> 3500.8390000000004
not trying to punish you it's a very

3499.359 --> 3504.24
logical

3500.839 --> 3507.52
step to go through

3504.24 --> 3507.52
in figuring things out

3510.64 --> 3514.64
sun and moon are real yeah but what are

3513.44 --> 3518.96
they though

3514.64 --> 3521.5989999999997
they're real apparent lights in apparent

3518.96 --> 3523.68
locations

3521.599 --> 3525.28
they're real holographic phenomenon

3523.68 --> 3526.48
absolutely

3525.28 --> 3530.2000000000003
and we do

3526.48 --> 3530.2
absorb light

3531.119 --> 3535.52
indeed

3533.28 --> 3537.8390000000004
but you can't prove that the light has

3535.52 --> 3540.48
transversed a certain

3537.839 --> 3543.2
trajectory

3540.48 --> 3547.319
from a original source point that's the

3543.2 --> 3547.319
thing that's completely lacking

3560.079 --> 3564.799
who made the holograms oh my god

3563.2 --> 3566.8799999999997
suddenly they're holograms and now we

3564.799 --> 3569.7599999999998
have to know everything about it

3566.88 --> 3571.28
instantly because switching back to six

3569.76 --> 3574.079
year old mode

3571.28 --> 3577.0400000000004
now immediately have to know everything

3574.079 --> 3579.2000000000003
like i know who made it

3577.04 --> 3581.04
i think it's just part of the realms

3579.2 --> 3582.0
design

3581.04 --> 3583.52
it was

3582.0 --> 3584.96
design

3583.52 --> 3587.52
and

3584.96 --> 3591.119
there is a description

3587.52 --> 3595.52
roughly of the process in genesis

3591.119 --> 3595.52
so it has been addressed

3598.72 --> 3602.5589999999997
god

3599.76 --> 3602.559
the designer

3602.88 --> 3609.04
the designer of this place and the

3604.799 --> 3609.04
designer of all things in it

3609.119 --> 3612.559
all the life

3611.04 --> 3614.16
of the setup of the realm the

3612.559 --> 3615.119
architecture

3614.16 --> 3618.3999999999996
of its

3615.119 --> 3618.4
well its construction

3624.88 --> 3629.44
don't get annoyed if i ask about no no

3627.359 --> 3630.96
that's fine i'm just overreacting a

3629.44 --> 3633.119
little

3630.96 --> 3636.319
it's just that i've had those types of

3633.119 --> 3638.1600000000003
questions from trolls

3636.319 --> 3640.319
like in the past i've had those

3638.16 --> 3642.16
questions then i just honestly answered

3640.319 --> 3646.079
the question and then those people just

3642.16 --> 3648.3999999999996
get into massive gamma rages

3646.079 --> 3650.48
so having sort of like a

3648.4 --> 3653.52
delayed allergic response i think don't

3650.48 --> 3653.52
take it too personal

3654.96 --> 3658.88
they are good questions

3657.44 --> 3661.44
especially if you really want to

3658.88 --> 3661.44
understand

3664.24 --> 3668.2
definitely not a pro

3694.799 --> 3700.16
i like to chew up the meat and spit out

3696.799 --> 3702.72
the bones yeah that's a very sensible

3700.16 --> 3702.72
thing to do

3714.48 --> 3717.52
marine curves right

3717.599 --> 3723.119
i totally get it i like i have that

3720.799 --> 3726.119
instinct too it's what's driving me as

3723.119 --> 3726.119
well

3727.359 --> 3732.16
it's just that the more you learn you

3729.119 --> 3734.88
more you learn that

3732.16 --> 3737.0389999999998
like everything ever taken for granted

3734.88 --> 3740.7200000000003
is just all

3737.039 --> 3743.039
like manage managed delusions

3740.72 --> 3744.5589999999997
and mistakes that are just

3743.039 --> 3747.2000000000003
lost

3744.559 --> 3747.2000000000003
in the soup

3750.48 --> 3754.16
and that yeah

3752.16 --> 3757.1189999999997
actually figuring out it's just gonna

3754.16 --> 3759.7599999999998
give you constant opposition

3757.119 --> 3762.079
constantly people like ah

3759.76 --> 3764.1600000000003
why are you saying that

3762.079 --> 3767.119
like oh

3764.16 --> 3770.16
you're shaming this and that

3767.119 --> 3772.799
this lore this thing that we claim is

3770.16 --> 3772.799
reality

3778.799 --> 3783.68
phil is a

3780.839 --> 3786.0
huge um

3783.68 --> 3788.64
no george sanford he is actually a

3786.0 --> 3788.64
youtuber

3789.359 --> 3792.48
troll i don't know i don't see him as a

3791.52 --> 3794.64
troll

3792.48 --> 3797.64
anti-flat earther

3794.64 --> 3797.64
perhaps

3809.68 --> 3812.68
uh

3842.48 --> 3846.559
i agree there woodworking gummy bear

3851.76 --> 3856.559
i mean

3852.76 --> 3856.559
heliocentrism can be like

3857.24 --> 3861.2
distractions that kind of like make you

3860.079 --> 3862.88
think

3861.2 --> 3864.16
but

3862.88 --> 3867.2000000000003
yeah

3864.16 --> 3871.1189999999997
actually figuring out that the true

3867.2 --> 3873.68
and the surreal mysteries is

3871.119 --> 3876.96
much more exciting it's like scary like

3873.68 --> 3878.72
viscerally thrilling at times

3876.96 --> 3881.7200000000003
because you know like it changes

3878.72 --> 3881.72
everything

3882.24 --> 3888.0
and you start to see the mistakes

3885.44 --> 3888.0
everywhere

3888.48 --> 3891.68
now you have to deal with those mistakes

3890.24 --> 3892.839
that others

3891.68 --> 3895.7599999999998
do not

3892.839 --> 3897.92
see how do you do that how do you get

3895.76 --> 3900.92
through to people it's a challenge every

3897.92 --> 3900.92
time

3912.799 --> 3915.0389999999998
ah

3916.0 --> 3919.28
right yeah see you later woodworking

3917.359 --> 3920.64
gunny bear thanks for popping by always

3919.28 --> 3923.8390000000004
appreciate

3920.64 --> 3923.839
your input

3925.76 --> 3929.96
screw it i'm going to give you a wrench

3938.0 --> 3941.799
mind the rules though

3950.799 --> 3955.68
should be more thankful for the

3952.4 --> 3955.6800000000003
awesomeness well

3956.72 --> 3960.5589999999997
the more you do understand especially

3958.72 --> 3963.5989999999997
about the spiritual the more you get a

3960.559 --> 3967.039
feel for it it's nature

3963.599 --> 3969.52
you do realize that designers like

3967.039 --> 3970.48
really made it work

3969.52 --> 3972.96
like

3970.48 --> 3975.839
it even works even when you don't

3972.96 --> 3980.319
understand how

3975.839 --> 3980.319
and that's like a real like a

3980.799 --> 3986.44
designer's miracle

3983.119 --> 3986.44
in the pattern

4000.64 --> 4005.64
all right

4001.76 --> 4005.6400000000003
but yeah thankful

4006.64 --> 4012.52
for the awesomeness of reality and the

4008.88 --> 4012.52
challenge of it

4030.72 --> 4037.2
okay so professor phil well you're a

4032.88 --> 4037.2000000000003
lecturer then you you make lectures

4042.24 --> 4046.3999999999996
i mean

4043.52 --> 4048.88
if you're a teacher what people did you

4046.4 --> 4051.119
helped

4048.88 --> 4054.4
like name or one name

4051.119 --> 4058.0
did you have actual students that

4054.4 --> 4058.0
because of your exclusive

4059.839 --> 4065.44
information and teachings

4062.559 --> 4068.7200000000003
like graduated with some paper

4065.44 --> 4068.7200000000003
for something significant

4070.079 --> 4073.52
youtube

4071.28 --> 4076.559
well laugh laugh about it george sanford

4073.52 --> 4080.48
i am technically like that i mean i do

4076.559 --> 4080.48
not claim to have any degrees

4080.799 --> 4085.119
i try to

4082.319 --> 4087.52
just present the information as my

4085.119 --> 4087.52
degree

4089.28 --> 4092.559
i just deal in

4094.0 --> 4098.28
long-term valuable information

4105.6 --> 4111.6
but i try to compose myself in the

4108.159 --> 4111.599999999999
process as a teacher

4114.799 --> 4119.12
but it's more like an attitude thing

4116.88 --> 4121.279
it's not like oh that's my

4119.12 --> 4126.0
i'm not getting

4121.279 --> 4126.0
on the payroll for that literally

4129.04 --> 4132.04
supervised

4138.0 --> 4145.08
hey lsg good to see you

4141.44 --> 4145.08
one for the unit

4154.239 --> 4161.839
okay you supervise them so you

4158.239 --> 4161.839
you check their work

4162.0 --> 4172.44
are you like available for questions

4166.88 --> 4172.4400000000005
are you responsible for anybody's grades

4176.96 --> 4184.279
supervised is kind of vague

4180.08 --> 4184.2789999999995
could mean a lot of different things

4207.04 --> 4209.84
wait what are you talking about david

4208.719 --> 4213.08
hall

4209.84 --> 4213.08
low dx

4224.4 --> 4228.759999999999
they might supervise the candidate

4230.08 --> 4233.199
right or the hallway

4234.0 --> 4239.48
i mean i think it would probably make a

4235.92 --> 4239.4800000000005
great hall monitor

4255.76 --> 4260.96
i guess i'm not getting a

4258.8 --> 4262.8
an answer beyond that professor phil

4260.96 --> 4265.76
bell

4262.8 --> 4269.52
you are perfect you run lectures and do

4265.76 --> 4269.52
assessments of students work

4269.76 --> 4272.76
okay

4273.6 --> 4278.64
so what are these lectures is it like a

4275.92 --> 4278.64
specific

4280.4 --> 4283.4
curriculum

4291.76 --> 4295.0
what curriculum

4302.48 --> 4309.919999999999
supervisor research projects okay

4306.08 --> 4309.92
well that's kind of sounds interesting

4313.36 --> 4315.839999999999
maybe

4318.08 --> 4322.5599999999995
but yeah again

4320.32 --> 4323.759999999999
you run lectures and you do assessment

4322.56 --> 4325.84
so

4323.76 --> 4328.159000000001
what curriculum

4325.84 --> 4330.2390000000005
that sounds like a description of what

4328.159 --> 4332.96
involves a curriculum so what is the

4330.239 --> 4332.959999999999
curriculum

4337.199 --> 4342.839999999999
guys could you stop squirting please i'm

4339.04 --> 4342.84
trying to hear him out

4367.12 --> 4370.12
ah

4391.76 --> 4397.6
can't be expected

4393.76 --> 4399.84
now i can actually angel spoons

4397.6 --> 4402.320000000001
that's ridiculous i do

4399.84 --> 4402.32
actually

4403.36 --> 4408.08
i've always been fascinated by teachers

4405.76 --> 4412.2390000000005
my entire life

4408.08 --> 4414.5599999999995
i'm the kid that like oh

4412.239 --> 4416.879999999999
it's the break time

4414.56 --> 4419.84
and always like look like is the teacher

4416.88 --> 4422.32
like available for inquiry as does he

4419.84 --> 4423.28
like really need a break

4422.32 --> 4426.08
because

4423.28 --> 4429.36
i would be like okay can i have like the

4426.08 --> 4431.28
information now concerning like what

4429.36 --> 4433.92
like what i'm gonna need to know like in

4431.28 --> 4433.92
10 years

4435.76 --> 4439.76
and some of the teachers really

4437.52 --> 4442.0
appreciate that because i would like

4439.76 --> 4443.92
inspire them like somebody really wants

4442.0 --> 4444.88
to know others would be like oh leave me

4443.92 --> 4448.2390000000005
alone

4444.88 --> 4449.679
i just want to keep things simple

4448.239 --> 4453.44
so

4449.679 --> 4455.36
i'm just trying to figure it out here

4453.44 --> 4458.799999999999
structural engineering

4455.36 --> 4460.32
particle physics oh there orbit oh god

4458.8 --> 4463.52
so

4460.32 --> 4463.5199999999995
theoretical physics

4463.6 --> 4467.360000000001
and a bit of structural engineering i

4465.44 --> 4469.44
guess

4467.36 --> 4471.679
but that sounds like mostly theoretical

4469.44 --> 4472.879999999999
physics

4471.679 --> 4476.84
correct

4472.88 --> 4476.84
do you recognize that

4484.84 --> 4490.400000000001
aerodynamics really

4487.52 --> 4492.8
okay that is actually interesting

4490.4 --> 4495.12
like real aerodynamics is quite an

4492.8 --> 4497.84
extensive field of data

4495.12 --> 4497.84
to work with

4500.08 --> 4503.6
all of them require a container by the

4502.239 --> 4505.36
way

4503.6 --> 4508.360000000001
but i don't need to remind you about

4505.36 --> 4508.36
that

4518.56 --> 4523.76
anyway thank you for

4520.48 --> 4526.718999999999
for answering the questions

4523.76 --> 4526.719
i appreciate that

4534.159 --> 4537.28
right but you do realize that you are

4536.4 --> 4539.12
just

4537.28 --> 4541.679
basically teaching them

4539.12 --> 4545.44
mostly theoretical things

4541.679 --> 4545.4400000000005
it's not really engineering

4546.64 --> 4551.1990000000005
right because theoretical things

4551.28 --> 4555.12
is not the same as engineering

4552.8 --> 4558.88
engineering is like how do you make

4555.12 --> 4558.88
things happen physically

4559.44 --> 4564.08
not

4560.719 --> 4566.4800000000005
about like oh how how do you deal with

4564.08 --> 4569.5199999999995
like more information related things

4566.48 --> 4571.36
like orbital mechanics

4569.52 --> 4574.0
and

4571.36 --> 4576.96
particle physics that's like

4574.0 --> 4578.56
only that's info the only data you get

4576.96 --> 4580.64
to work with

4578.56 --> 4583.92
whether you believe it or not

4580.64 --> 4583.92
it's information

4584.48 --> 4589.199
it's just information so that's purely

4586.8 --> 4592.88
theoretical you're not actually engaging

4589.199 --> 4595.839999999999
in like structural engineering

4592.88 --> 4598.64
like okay let's build this thing let's

4595.84 --> 4601.04
like create a

4598.64 --> 4603.04
special i don't know i'm not

4601.04 --> 4606.159
super informed about electronics with

4603.04 --> 4609.5199999999995
like some electronic device

4606.159 --> 4612.4
right that's engineering building stuff

4609.52 --> 4612.400000000001
making it work

4618.8 --> 4624.719
get engineered okay well i hope they're

4621.92 --> 4626.4800000000005
not just exclusively getting your class

4624.719 --> 4627.6
because

4626.48 --> 4630.08
i mean

4627.6 --> 4633.92
yeah i take it they all like there's

4630.08 --> 4635.92
other teachers there too that

4633.92 --> 4637.52
teach actual engineering because

4635.92 --> 4639.52
otherwise yeah those degrees are not

4637.52 --> 4642.64
going to be all that useful if you just

4639.52 --> 4644.320000000001
learn about orbital mechanics and

4642.64 --> 4646.159000000001
all that nonsense

4644.32 --> 4649.5599999999995
it's purely information-based it's

4646.159 --> 4649.5599999999995
purely theoretical

4657.36 --> 4660.88
we do building projects

4662.48 --> 4665.48
fine

4684.8 --> 4687.76
that feels cool

4686.719 --> 4689.36
right

4687.76 --> 4692.4800000000005
well look

4689.36 --> 4694.639999999999
if you're gonna like graduate

4692.48 --> 4696.879999999999
as a

4694.64 --> 4700.0
theoretical physicist

4696.88 --> 4702.08
then you're like classified a theorist

4700.0 --> 4703.52
that's not an engineer

4702.08 --> 4707.5599999999995
so he's gonna they're gonna actually

4703.52 --> 4707.56
have to learn actual engineering

4708.159 --> 4712.639999999999
and a bunch of theoretical physics and

4710.159 --> 4713.92
then some kind of tests

4712.64 --> 4716.64
that you do

4713.92 --> 4718.96
to support those theoretical things

4716.64 --> 4720.64
that's not really engineering that also

4718.96 --> 4723.44
falls

4720.64 --> 4726.400000000001
under theoretical physics

4723.44 --> 4726.4
not engineering

4730.8 --> 4734.719
like just because you're like

4732.8 --> 4738.96
building stuff doesn't make it

4734.719 --> 4742.0
engineering engineering is like building

4738.96 --> 4742.0
complicated things

4746.239 --> 4751.36
like for example

4748.719 --> 4753.36
let's build a basic computer and that's

4751.36 --> 4755.599999999999
very much in the department of

4753.36 --> 4756.88
electronic engineering

4755.6 --> 4759.04
right

4756.88 --> 4761.1990000000005
that would be engineering

4759.04 --> 4764.48
electronics

4761.199 --> 4764.48
or like oh let's

4766.32 --> 4769.04
make a

4767.52 --> 4770.56
a new an

4769.04 --> 4771.5199999999995
engine

4770.56 --> 4775.679
that

4771.52 --> 4778.320000000001
that goes on a very unusual type of uh

4775.679 --> 4780.159
combustive material or something right

4778.32 --> 4781.36
like how do you fine-tune that and then

4780.159 --> 4783.28
you get

4781.36 --> 4786.719
engineering

4783.28 --> 4786.719
more mechanical engineering

4788.8 --> 4793.6
if it's just about theoretical things

4791.12 --> 4795.44
and you build a couple of tests to try

4793.6 --> 4797.679
to support those theoretical things

4795.44 --> 4799.678999999999
that's not really engineering that falls

4797.679 --> 4801.12
under theoretical physics

4799.679 --> 4803.36
just because you have some kind of

4801.12 --> 4806.0
physical demonstration

4803.36 --> 4809.599999999999
to support your theory

4806.0 --> 4809.6
doesn't make it engineering

4809.92 --> 4815.28
not really

4811.92 --> 4817.84
i mean if it's really serious it could

4815.28 --> 4820.08
like open up a door of engineering

4817.84 --> 4822.08
developments

4820.08 --> 4823.5199999999995
but that's different

4822.08 --> 4825.84
that doesn't sound like what you're

4823.52 --> 4827.76
doing

4825.84 --> 4830.400000000001
i mean there's not going to be like some

4827.76 --> 4832.88
engineering development rolling out of

4830.4 --> 4837.5199999999995
orbital mechanics where devices are

4832.88 --> 4837.52
built specifically for orbital mechanics

4837.679 --> 4840.4800000000005
like

4838.8 --> 4843.52
right it's all just going to be

4840.48 --> 4843.5199999999995
information based

4843.76 --> 4846.88
you're not going to build some device

4845.6 --> 4849.4400000000005
for that

4846.88 --> 4849.4400000000005
out of that

4855.04 --> 4858.04
ah

4864.48 --> 4869.199
the lay for person view of engineering

4869.92 --> 4874.84
faculty is called engineering okay

4875.84 --> 4879.719
construction aeronautics

4894.88 --> 4897.36
all right

4901.52 --> 4905.76
but yeah again

4903.36 --> 4908.08
that's not going to be uh those jobs are

4905.76 --> 4910.719
not going to be exclusively based on

4908.08 --> 4913.12
your teachings

4910.719 --> 4915.6
you have other teachers too right you're

4913.12 --> 4917.599999999999
not like the only teacher for these

4915.6 --> 4918.4800000000005
students i take it

4917.6 --> 4920.719
because

4918.48 --> 4923.28
everything you named

4920.719 --> 4924.639
that you teach that's not gonna

4923.28 --> 4927.199
yield them

4924.639 --> 4927.1990000000005
all that

4927.679 --> 4930.96
like especially the satellite part

4929.44 --> 4933.678999999999
you're gonna have to actually know

4930.96 --> 4933.679
electronics

4936.88 --> 4941.36
and with construction you're gonna

4938.32 --> 4945.0
actually have to have like

4941.36 --> 4945.0
structural engineering

4947.84 --> 4951.92
like architecture type

4950.639 --> 4955.639
engineering

4951.92 --> 4955.639
right anyway

4985.52 --> 4989.92
you have lectures under you all right oh

4988.239 --> 4991.599999999999
dude maybe you've built up quite a

4989.92 --> 4993.84
routine and

4991.6 --> 4995.92
you're good at it

4993.84 --> 4998.159000000001
right it's just

4995.92 --> 5000.56
like i'm satisfied from the way you've

4998.159 --> 5002.5599999999995
even presented the information that you

5000.56 --> 5006.2390000000005
probably do have some kind of a

5002.56 --> 5010.88
teacher's job but it all sounds more

5006.239 --> 5010.879999999999
in like theoretical physics department

5012.56 --> 5018.320000000001
which alone again would not really yield

5015.679 --> 5021.56
the full professions and all that that

5018.32 --> 5021.5599999999995
you imagined

5028.719 --> 5033.44
right but

5030.48 --> 5035.678999999999
like knowing those types of things don't

5033.44 --> 5037.839999999999
doesn't really super impress me because

5035.679 --> 5039.4400000000005
i know it's all theoretical i know how

5037.84 --> 5041.52
it works i know

5039.44 --> 5043.839999999999
it's mostly dealing with information and

5041.52 --> 5044.88
applying math

5043.84 --> 5048.12
right

5044.88 --> 5048.12
i know

5056.639 --> 5059.679
oh

5057.76 --> 5063.84
basically

5059.679 --> 5063.84
undergrad no no david hall

5068.48 --> 5071.919999999999
no and by the way pieces of paper have

5070.4 --> 5075.199
never really impressed me because

5071.92 --> 5077.679
they're basically just like a mark on

5075.199 --> 5079.04
what type of information they have gone

5077.679 --> 5081.12
through

5079.04 --> 5083.5199999999995
right it's just a bunch of information

5081.12 --> 5085.76
you have to know the details and now

5083.52 --> 5087.360000000001
you know how to deal with the details if

5085.76 --> 5089.679
you

5087.36 --> 5092.719
find cohesion in it

5089.679 --> 5092.719
she can get a grip

5092.88 --> 5097.92
but i kind of like know what type of

5095.679 --> 5100.639
information is available out there even

5097.92 --> 5103.92
though i don't know all the details i

5100.639 --> 5103.92
got a good feel for that

5105.04 --> 5110.4
i've spoken with people that have

5107.679 --> 5113.04
mastered certain insights

5110.4 --> 5114.799999999999
and then like hurt them out on their key

5113.04 --> 5116.48
expertise

5114.8 --> 5120.400000000001
like

5116.48 --> 5123.04
say something that's like really

5120.4 --> 5125.04
detailed and on point that you would

5123.04 --> 5127.92
share with like a

5125.04 --> 5129.6
like a really close colleague

5127.92 --> 5131.92
like challenge me

5129.6 --> 5134.08
and then i figure it out then i figure

5131.92 --> 5137.08
out okay that's what they do that's the

5134.08 --> 5137.08
frequency

5156.8 --> 5160.719
you don't know this nope i don't

5165.12 --> 5170.48
but then again look the lingo is very

5168.08 --> 5171.76
different i am not really familiar with

5170.48 --> 5174.5599999999995
like

5171.76 --> 5178.56
even the system set up

5174.56 --> 5180.88
like american school systems like i

5178.56 --> 5183.679
i have a trouble having a getting a grip

5180.88 --> 5186.96
even on like the

5183.679 --> 5189.84
like how it's laid out because it seems

5186.96 --> 5192.4
just very different from how it how i've

5189.84 --> 5194.32
learned it in the netherlands

5192.4 --> 5197.719
netherlands has also undergone a lot of

5194.32 --> 5197.719
changes but

5199.6 --> 5203.92
so yeah i don't know like all these

5201.52 --> 5203.92
words

5204.0 --> 5210.32
like oh this specific element of that or

5207.92 --> 5213.1990000000005
that degree that degree like i i'm not

5210.32 --> 5215.679
entirely sure like where on the scale

5213.199 --> 5215.678999999999
that is

5216.32 --> 5220.0
and i mix it up

5217.92 --> 5223.8
sometimes especially in the past i

5220.0 --> 5223.8
totally mixed it up

5236.48 --> 5243.5599999999995
beginning a specialization in a

5238.719 --> 5243.56
dissertation yeah that that makes sense

5274.88 --> 5280.52
astrophysics degree holder drive for

5277.52 --> 5280.52
uber

5281.44 --> 5284.5599999999995
right

5282.4 --> 5286.879999999999
because it's just a bunch of theoretical

5284.56 --> 5286.88
stuff

5288.0 --> 5294.12
but you can't really do anything with it

5290.159 --> 5294.12
except make stories

5319.96 --> 5324.08
[Music]

5321.36 --> 5327.199
yeah one for the unit it's not this is

5324.08 --> 5327.199
not the place for it

5329.6 --> 5333.92
i'm i'm pretty sure professor field bell

5332.159 --> 5337.638999999999
is very well aware of all the

5333.92 --> 5337.639
housekeeping questions

5375.92 --> 5379.32
well you know

5380.08 --> 5384.4
it would be kind of interesting to get a

5382.159 --> 5387.199
more inside look even into what

5384.4 --> 5390.48
professor phil bell does if he'd had the

5387.199 --> 5390.48
balls to actually

5391.36 --> 5396.159
show and not tell

5393.28 --> 5398.32
right i'd i'd be interesting to like at

5396.159 --> 5400.719
least once

5398.32 --> 5403.36
it would probably be very similar

5400.719 --> 5404.639
as what we know like the the flat earth

5403.36 --> 5406.799999999999
meetups

5404.639 --> 5408.32
and then the stage presentations it's

5406.8 --> 5410.4800000000005
probably a little bit like that but i'd

5408.32 --> 5414.159
like to see that some like

5410.48 --> 5416.0
maybe you could like film your colleges

5414.159 --> 5418.5599999999995
with the students

5416.0 --> 5420.48
if they they're like like you of course

5418.56 --> 5423.280000000001
have to ask them

5420.48 --> 5425.04
like are you okay like

5423.28 --> 5427.84
i want to show

5425.04 --> 5429.84
the world out there what i do

5427.84 --> 5431.76
that would be interesting to see like

5429.84 --> 5434.8
i'd like to see like how well do you

5431.76 --> 5436.159000000001
even do maybe you're really good at it

5434.8 --> 5438.2390000000005
right

5436.159 --> 5439.28
i'm not that's why on purpose i'm not

5438.239 --> 5441.44
trying to

5439.28 --> 5443.28
shame you for any teaching ability i'm

5441.44 --> 5444.879999999999
just

5443.28 --> 5447.28
trying to take a little bit of a weight

5444.88 --> 5449.76
off your shoulders because you seem to

5447.28 --> 5451.04
think you're really high up there

5449.76 --> 5453.360000000001
that's it

5451.04 --> 5455.199
but maybe you are pretty decent in your

5453.36 --> 5456.96
lectures

5455.199 --> 5459.28
i'd like to see it sometime maybe you

5456.96 --> 5461.6
could film it like as it's happening

5459.28 --> 5462.639
live in front of a live

5461.6 --> 5464.56
crowd

5462.639 --> 5467.36
of your students

5464.56 --> 5467.360000000001
that would be great

5468.32 --> 5472.759999999999
just to demonstrate that that's real

5487.76 --> 5491.92
this gadget inspector

5490.64 --> 5495.320000000001
[Music]

5491.92 --> 5495.32
oh boy

5505.44 --> 5509.5199999999995
oh trippy guns of nephron good to see

5508.159 --> 5512.839999999999
you by the way

5509.52 --> 5512.84
how are you doing

5538.08 --> 5544.5199999999995
gate kept by tuition

5541.52 --> 5544.52
what

5546.0 --> 5550.0
well look

5547.84 --> 5553.12
if that's the case then

5550.0 --> 5553.12
he could basically

5557.199 --> 5560.4
hmm

5558.639 --> 5561.92
i don't know

5560.4 --> 5565.04
i i get it

5561.92 --> 5565.04
but still you know

5565.12 --> 5570.5599999999995
it i think it would be good for his

5567.679 --> 5572.56
image if he actually showed a live

5570.56 --> 5574.56
demonstration of what he's been claiming

5572.56 --> 5576.96
he's doing

5574.56 --> 5579.04
i think that would be worth it

5576.96 --> 5580.719
like if that's all real

5579.04 --> 5582.88
and he's actually a

5580.719 --> 5584.639
decent teacher then

5582.88 --> 5588.04
i think that would take a lot of weight

5584.639 --> 5588.04
off his shoulders

5589.679 --> 5593.36
because a lot of people don't believe

5592.239 --> 5596.159
you

5593.36 --> 5598.239
let me tell you professor phil bell and

5596.159 --> 5600.0
yeah it's not strange that we're very

5598.239 --> 5601.839999999999
suspicious because there's a whole bunch

5600.0 --> 5604.159
of pretenders

5601.84 --> 5607.360000000001
fakers

5604.159 --> 5612.92
on that side of yours

5607.36 --> 5612.92
very easy to just claim they do things

5616.159 --> 5619.599999999999
so i think it would be worth it

5618.239 --> 5622.239
you know it doesn't mean that oh you

5619.6 --> 5624.08
have to do everything live now right you

5622.239 --> 5626.32
have to like

5624.08 --> 5628.8
do an entire season

5626.32 --> 5633.04
on camera no that's not what i'm just do

5628.8 --> 5633.04
it once do it once or twice

5634.639 --> 5640.159000000001
maybe even like interview the students

5638.56 --> 5641.679
if they're up for that

5640.159 --> 5643.839999999999
and like ask them hey what are you doing

5641.679 --> 5646.4800000000005
where you going what do you think about

5643.84 --> 5646.4800000000005
the teaching

5647.679 --> 5652.8
i think that would be good

5649.679 --> 5652.8
if it's real

5653.12 --> 5659.84
you can watch actual lectures on my

5655.28 --> 5662.0
channel yeah but that's you on camera

5659.84 --> 5664.639
do you ever do with a live audience or

5662.0 --> 5667.12
have you always done everything just on

5664.639 --> 5667.12
camera

5668.239 --> 5672.12
because that's not the same

5689.6 --> 5692.88
have you ever sat

5691.76 --> 5696.639
in a

5692.88 --> 5698.639
in a classroom with live students

5696.639 --> 5700.56
physically in the same room with you as

5698.639 --> 5703.6
you taught them have you ever done that

5700.56 --> 5703.6
professor phil bill

5706.32 --> 5710.0
doesn't matter covetix no

5711.199 --> 5715.5199999999995
no i'm pretty sure he's he's been doing

5713.76 --> 5719.679
that

5715.52 --> 5719.679
before all that started to unfold

5721.76 --> 5727.6
so it's just a question have you ever

5724.08 --> 5729.04
sat in a classroom

5727.6 --> 5730.8
with

5729.04 --> 5732.4
live students

5730.8 --> 5735.04
physically present

5732.4 --> 5736.799999999999
and taught them your curriculum

5735.04 --> 5741.4
in that setup have you ever done that

5736.8 --> 5741.400000000001
professor field that's my question

5755.36 --> 5761.48
okay is that on camera frank deb

5758.48 --> 5761.48
drabin

5770.0 --> 5773.6
watch that

5771.28 --> 5773.599999999999
yeah

5777.84 --> 5784.4400000000005
it's on a side of a college

5781.44 --> 5784.44
really

5790.4 --> 5796.08
i'd be kind of interested to see that

5794.08 --> 5798.0
can i watch like does anybody have a

5796.08 --> 5801.239
link to that i know both of you don't

5798.0 --> 5801.239
have wrenches

5848.32 --> 5852.48
right

5849.92 --> 5856.4800000000005
yeah okay well frank that driving so

5852.48 --> 5858.48
maybe it it's not a university or

5856.48 --> 5862.799999999999
maybe it's not like a university that

5858.48 --> 5862.799999999999
actually has a big building available

5863.76 --> 5868.0
i don't know is that like does it

5866.239 --> 5869.839999999999
require

5868.0 --> 5872.56
to have such a

5869.84 --> 5874.88
huge compound to actually classify as a

5872.56 --> 5876.8
university i don't even know how that

5874.88 --> 5878.96
works officially

5876.8 --> 5880.56
is that a thing

5878.96 --> 5883.28
so if you didn't have the building it

5880.56 --> 5887.080000000001
wouldn't classify as a university or
