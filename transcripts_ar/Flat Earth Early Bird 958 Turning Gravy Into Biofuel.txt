90.4 --> 96.16900000000001
wow the weather today is unbelievable

93.09 --> 96.169
[Music]

97.04 --> 104.0
super blue

100.32 --> 106.96
bunch of clouds here and there but

104.0 --> 106.96
it's so clear

107.439 --> 113.52
and it's very sunny

110.56 --> 115.84
very very sunny still very moist though

113.52 --> 115.83999999999999
but

134.48 --> 140.16
pointing the camera at them sure if you

137.52 --> 140.16
pick that up

141.44 --> 143.84
right

146.8 --> 149.52
midsummer

150.239 --> 158.48000000000002
it is sunday the 18th

154.56 --> 158.48
of july 2021

162.56 --> 167.2
sunday show gonna be one hour maybe one

165.92 --> 169.51899999999998
and a half

167.2 --> 172.64
we'll see maybe longer depending on

169.519 --> 172.64000000000001
who's going to roll in and

174.0 --> 179.28
what's going to be brought up all right

176.16 --> 182.84
so it's currently 27 degrees celsius

179.28 --> 199.84
and 50 humidity zero percent

182.84 --> 199.84
participation precipitation

201.36 --> 207.92000000000002
right so yeah the title unfortunately

204.56 --> 207.92000000000002
doesn't come with a giant

208.0 --> 211.599
story behind it it's just kind of

210.08 --> 214.31900000000002
something that

211.599 --> 216.0
i think i've even said it before a while

214.319 --> 218.0
back

216.0 --> 219.2
just thought like that's a good thing to

218.0 --> 221.76
make into a

219.2 --> 224.79899999999998
picture anatomy can help me out

221.76 --> 226.879
magnificently like that's

224.799 --> 229.28
what he came with was better than i even

226.879 --> 232.48
thought it would be

229.28 --> 235.36
so yeah i really appreciate

232.48 --> 235.35999999999999
adam meekin's

235.599 --> 241.28
picture editing work i really love it

238.08 --> 243.92000000000002
and thank you for just

241.28 --> 246.56
making this show just a little bit more

243.92 --> 246.55999999999997
interesting

251.12 --> 257.359
title cards they have an influence

254.319 --> 261.199
anyway yeah turning gravy into biofuel

257.359 --> 264.24
of course has to do with benjamin's

261.199 --> 267.36
gravy right so

264.24 --> 271.68
it's of course a play in words was

267.36 --> 274.56
that gravy is not literally gravy

271.68 --> 276.08
but yeah even in the industry out here

274.56 --> 277.44
there have been programs don't know if

276.08 --> 281.919
they're still running

277.44 --> 283.759
i like crying fats and oils are gathered

281.919 --> 288.15999999999997
and then

283.759 --> 288.16
basically refined into biofuels

288.4 --> 296.0
so i thought that was kind of funny so

290.56 --> 300.0
maybe in this case the biofuel is also

296.0 --> 303.759
or a spiritual

300.0 --> 305.84
thing i'll leave it up to you to think

303.759 --> 311.44
about it

305.84 --> 313.84
somebody's gonna finally say hello

311.44 --> 313.84
hello

315.36 --> 325.84000000000003
anybody out there

345.199 --> 352.88
i mean is like everybody now sitting at

347.44 --> 355.68
the beach or something

352.88 --> 355.68
i've never had

359.28 --> 365.67999999999995
this little amount of participation in

362.08 --> 369.19899999999996
my chat before what's going on

365.68 --> 369.199
seven watching according to

378.84 --> 381.84
numbers

391.28 --> 396.63899999999995
yeah no green tea with this weather but

394.08 --> 400.0
i did stack this

396.639 --> 400.0
nice filtered water bottle

400.08 --> 405.28
in the cooler i took it out right before

402.639 --> 407.52
i started to show

405.28 --> 408.479
plenty of liquids that won't make me

407.52 --> 411.12
break out in a

408.479 --> 411.12
heat rush

415.84 --> 420.79999999999995
so right before this show i just

417.919 --> 420.79999999999995
happened to watch

421.12 --> 424.72
that from quantum of conscious

425.759 --> 428.56
this video

431.44 --> 438.24
interesting and yeah

435.039 --> 438.24
it goes to show again

439.039 --> 443.36
even the not too incredibly distant

441.84 --> 445.039
history

443.36 --> 446.68
there's still a lot of things that we

445.039 --> 450.08
are not

446.68 --> 454.96
completely sure what exactly

450.08 --> 458.15999999999997
happened it's very glaring like

454.96 --> 460.56
there's all kinds of theories

458.16 --> 462.72
pretty logical worked out trains are

460.56 --> 465.52
thinking on like what exactly could have

462.72 --> 467.84000000000003
happened with the spanish flu

465.52 --> 469.75899999999996
and the trench wars and vaccines and

467.84 --> 470.79999999999995
every like what exactly happened like

469.759 --> 473.84000000000003
[ __ ] went down

470.8 --> 477.28000000000003
for sure and people died but like how

473.84 --> 477.28
did that actually happen

477.68 --> 484.8
oh i think that people

480.96 --> 488.15999999999997
maybe underestimate that like

484.8 --> 491.52000000000004
how much of an impact even

488.16 --> 494.8
a chemical warfare that was kind of

491.52 --> 499.599
peaking like it or

494.8 --> 502.479
it was being applied and that stuff

499.599 --> 504.08
the brews they concocted were like

502.479 --> 507.12
really horrific

504.08 --> 509.52
and usually based on like okay

507.12 --> 512.36
have some basic exposure and you die

509.52 --> 515.519
from it or you become

512.36 --> 517.12
decapacitated right that was how it was

515.519 --> 520.9590000000001
designed but they didn't

517.12 --> 524.08
however really care about

520.959 --> 526.0
was what would happen

524.08 --> 527.9200000000001
the ground could become with some of

526.0 --> 530.0
this stuff really poisoned and they

527.92 --> 532.959
didn't even know the side effect

530.0 --> 534.32
so maybe that could even in ways have

532.959 --> 536.88
been an imcritical

534.32 --> 536.88
influence

537.68 --> 541.4399999999999
anyway quantum conscious really got me

539.36 --> 545.6
thinking

541.44 --> 545.6
again because it's not the first time

547.6 --> 551.36
hello agm good to see you

555.92 --> 563.8389999999999
hey good servant good to see you

565.92 --> 568.24
all right

571.04 --> 574.0799999999999
hello flat side

574.399 --> 577.839
all right it's hot over there too

578.16 --> 582.56
not surprising but when it's this good

580.72 --> 583.2
weather in the netherlands then usually

582.56 --> 585.4399999999999
that

583.2 --> 585.44
does

587.6 --> 592.08
yeah the same accounts for like the

589.2 --> 592.08
entire region

592.8 --> 596.16
when that happens over here

599.2 --> 602.88
right also updates on the floods

601.04 --> 605.5999999999999
apparently like the floods are really

602.88 --> 610.48
all over the place here

605.6 --> 610.48
germany south of the netherlands belgium

611.76 --> 619.8389999999999
or is it raven like sinkholes and [ __ ]

614.32 --> 619.839
pretty freaky

621.04 --> 625.68
but right now it's beautiful weather so

629.12 --> 632.48
also there have been protests of course

631.36 --> 635.519
in france

632.48 --> 638.8000000000001
against the lockdown i saw a live stream

635.519 --> 640.16
from russia today and youtube oh thank

638.8 --> 642.56
you youtube

640.16 --> 643.68
that you actually put a special little

642.56 --> 646.959
banner there that

643.68 --> 649.1999999999999
rt might be in part or completely funded

646.959 --> 653.1999999999999
by the russian government

649.2 --> 656.24
oh thank you thank you for protecting me

653.2 --> 657.839
from the news the actual live streams

656.24 --> 661.76
that are literally filming on the

657.839 --> 663.9200000000001
streets without like prepared people

661.76 --> 666.64
no just filming what's out there yeah

663.92 --> 668.88
thanks for warning me

666.64 --> 668.88
right

672.0 --> 676.959
ireland doing lots of pros yeah there's

673.92 --> 679.519
more places in the world

676.959 --> 680.959
i just happened to bump into the the

679.519 --> 689.839
french protest

680.959 --> 689.8389999999999
when it was live streaming yesterday

693.92 --> 705.68
raining here well where are you at

702.88 --> 705.68
hey adam meekin

706.399 --> 717.839
that was a really awesome job on the

708.399 --> 717.839
title card thanks for that

724.32 --> 732.48
right and for those who don't know

728.24 --> 735.6800000000001
of course the title card is also an ode

732.48 --> 735.6800000000001
to owen benjamin

736.48 --> 745.76
bears will know that when they see it

739.839 --> 748.32
hope the big bear doesn't take offense

745.76 --> 750.639
or maybe i should hope that he would i

748.32 --> 750.639
don't know

756.639 --> 759.92
ah okay agent

760.88 --> 773.8389999999999
hey what's that

784.839 --> 790.32
ah

787.2 --> 795.6800000000001
that's pretty badass i guess

790.32 --> 795.6800000000001
not gonna play that but awesome

796.959 --> 801.8389999999999
hey nathan oakley 1980

804.8 --> 809.4399999999999
you made it and didn't have a clue you

807.12 --> 812.48
didn't know

809.44 --> 814.72
like dude you like

812.48 --> 818.32
it was an extra bonus that you actually

814.72 --> 818.32
put a sheep on the tractor

818.959 --> 825.5189999999999
like that's like high

822.079 --> 829.8389999999999
fractal stuff that you'd apparently

825.519 --> 829.839
partially unwittingly have put down

831.839 --> 835.6
no i thought it was absolutely brilliant

837.36 --> 843.839
thanks for man uh

845.6 --> 850.16
attention that bit right it's perfect

850.72 --> 857.839
sheep on a tractor

864.8 --> 870.16
all right that's that's almost like

866.8 --> 871.279
having a kick as a sheepdog right and

870.16 --> 874.48
then you have a sheep

871.279 --> 877.76
as a farmer using the tractor and then

874.48 --> 885.839
the farmer acting like a pig i guess

877.76 --> 885.8389999999999
and then the circle is complete

889.6 --> 899.839
hey kristen

924.839 --> 927.839
huh

958.88 --> 962.959
thank god i don't know that movie hey

961.199 --> 965.12
jim

962.959 --> 967.1199999999999
but i'm already figuring out like oh

965.12 --> 969.839
okay

967.12 --> 969.839
fine

984.959 --> 990.56
ah finally at least the chat's going it

987.92 --> 990.56
took a while

991.92 --> 1000.0
right now also i got a peach again

996.32 --> 1001.839
because last one was really nice so

1000.0 --> 1004.959
sure if i'm gonna eat it on the show but

1001.839 --> 1004.9590000000001
it's there as a backup

1008.88 --> 1011.8389999999999
right

1023.519 --> 1026.88
what am i doing yesterday

1027.36 --> 1034.0
we're watching ghostbusters

1030.88 --> 1035.5200000000002
but other than that it's like i missed

1034.0 --> 1039.76
everything

1035.52 --> 1041.6
really weird

1039.76 --> 1044.16
maybe that there weren't that many

1041.6 --> 1046.6399999999999
streams

1044.16 --> 1047.8390000000002
and of course ball busters not being

1046.64 --> 1050.96
live again

1047.839 --> 1055.12
it's kind of like sending you off

1050.96 --> 1058.4
into like and yeah

1055.12 --> 1060.32
it's like leaving dislocated territory

1058.4 --> 1067.8400000000001
like hey they're supposed to be freaking

1060.32 --> 1067.84
ball busters live you know

1070.24 --> 1074.48
because it is kind of a special show

1072.08 --> 1074.48
anyway

1078.84 --> 1081.84
uh

1087.44 --> 1094.4
what making lists now

1090.799 --> 1096.72
justin i don't appreciate that because

1094.4 --> 1099.44
you didn't put me on number one

1096.72 --> 1099.44
ah just kidding

1101.5 --> 1104.609
[Music]

1106.84 --> 1109.84
uh

1121.919 --> 1128.88
right so yeah i'm pretty much open for

1125.039 --> 1132.48
anything you guys want to bring up

1128.88 --> 1135.44
flat earth related out

1132.48 --> 1137.44
there in the world related what's going

1135.44 --> 1141.28
on out there

1137.44 --> 1144.3200000000002
or perhaps some particular media figure

1141.28 --> 1151.51
you're interested in

1144.32 --> 1154.76
did something special

1151.51 --> 1154.76
[Music]

1158.16 --> 1165.8400000000001
all right

1171.52 --> 1176.08
what is the gene therapy of the jab

1176.84 --> 1179.84
doing

1180.96 --> 1186.16
lots of different things but

1184.32 --> 1189.039
what i've managed to kind of like

1186.16 --> 1192.3200000000002
isolate just from the information

1189.039 --> 1195.28
what it most certainly is doing is

1192.32 --> 1195.28
like altering

1196.48 --> 1200.64
your genetics to produce a certain

1201.6 --> 1210.1589999999999
uh protein type they call spike proteins

1204.96 --> 1210.159
that your body starts to produce that

1210.32 --> 1216.1589999999999
that's the thing that i'm pretty certain

1213.039 --> 1216.1589999999999
it actually will do

1216.64 --> 1220.159
but yeah that's not the only thing

1218.48 --> 1222.48
probably there's just

1220.159 --> 1224.4
there's so many things that seem to get

1222.48 --> 1227.3600000000001
involved with

1224.4 --> 1229.2
making these things things that happen

1227.36 --> 1231.12
weird things

1229.2 --> 1233.44
like the whole shedding thing you know

1231.12 --> 1236.1589999999999
they've they've already built a

1233.44 --> 1237.76
virus presupposing story to account for

1236.159 --> 1241.0390000000002
why

1237.76 --> 1242.48
but i'm not buying that but there are

1241.039 --> 1245.84
things happening

1242.48 --> 1248.559
like weird and i think there's

1245.84 --> 1250.559
just another effect i think it has to do

1248.559 --> 1251.6
sounds a bit strange but i think it has

1250.559 --> 1256.48
more to do with like

1251.6 --> 1256.48
auras and electromagnetics of a person

1257.6 --> 1264.48
and like the social effects of that

1262.4 --> 1266.24
meeting people starting to take over

1264.48 --> 1269.2
their frequency as we would

1266.24 --> 1270.0
kind of identify it i think that has

1269.2 --> 1272.4
more to do

1270.0 --> 1275.039
with it than actual transmission of

1272.4 --> 1275.039
particles

1275.12 --> 1283.36
oh god yes the graphene oxide ivf

1278.96 --> 1287.039
that came by recently indeed sanford

1283.36 --> 1288.9599999999998
but that's just poison right that's just

1287.039 --> 1305.84
that's not even like genetic engineering

1288.96 --> 1305.8400000000001
that's just [ __ ] you up

1324.159 --> 1327.8400000000001
right but what seems to be happening

1327.12 --> 1331.6789999999999
that

1327.84 --> 1335.52
how i'm gathering my own way

1331.679 --> 1337.2
as a non-medically studied person

1335.52 --> 1339.12
but still learning a lot through a whole

1337.2 --> 1342.559
bunch of people

1339.12 --> 1345.6
what i'm getting out of it is that

1342.559 --> 1350.0
this gene therapy thing they do

1345.6 --> 1353.1999999999998
it is accompanied by very specific type

1350.0 --> 1354.88
of poisonous influence that are

1353.2 --> 1359.28
apparently

1354.88 --> 1363.5200000000002
maybe be necessary

1359.28 --> 1366.6399999999999
to like trigger the yeah the alteration

1363.52 --> 1367.44
transition of the genetic manipulation

1366.64 --> 1369.5200000000002
like

1367.44 --> 1370.88
it's not just like oh you put a little

1369.52 --> 1372.4
thingy in there and then

1370.88 --> 1374.0
blue blue blue blue and you become it

1372.4 --> 1377.679
now it it seems like

1374.0 --> 1380.48
the body might like need to undergo

1377.679 --> 1382.5590000000002
like severe toxic shock or something i'm

1380.48 --> 1384.559
being very sloppy in my terminology

1382.559 --> 1386.0
there like anatomy can please correct me

1384.559 --> 1388.799
on this

1386.0 --> 1389.76
right there needs to be this effect

1388.799 --> 1393.2
apparently

1389.76 --> 1393.2
in order to make it happen

1393.84 --> 1399.12
maybe or maybe that's just the added

1396.72 --> 1400.4
bonus maybe it's just a dual price it's

1399.12 --> 1402.559
like okay

1400.4 --> 1405.2
we give you a huge amount of right

1402.559 --> 1406.1589999999999
poisons that combined will probably kill

1405.2 --> 1408.64
you

1406.159 --> 1410.24
but if they don't then they're still

1408.64 --> 1411.8400000000001
yeah you'll still be genetically

1410.24 --> 1415.1200000000001
engineered to basically just

1411.84 --> 1416.32
self-destruct at some point it could be

1415.12 --> 1419.039
just that basic

1416.32 --> 1419.039
and malicious

1425.84 --> 1430.48
but maybe there is some kind of yeah i

1428.4 --> 1433.6000000000001
don't know man

1430.48 --> 1436.72
right so safe to say

1433.6 --> 1436.7199999999998
better not take it

1437.12 --> 1440.3999999999999
i count yourself lucky if you didn't end

1440.159 --> 1444.0800000000002
up

1440.4 --> 1445.679
all crippled if you have taken it

1444.08 --> 1449.1999999999998
already

1445.679 --> 1450.3200000000002
because yeah all these symptoms all this

1449.2 --> 1453.679
stuff that's not

1450.32 --> 1455.36
disease based that's poison based right

1453.679 --> 1459.2
so to assume like oh i

1455.36 --> 1462.9599999999998
i didn't go

1459.2 --> 1464.96
or whatever the first time so then it

1462.96 --> 1465.279
means it's safe i can't get that no no

1464.96 --> 1468.32
no

1465.279 --> 1471.279
you can absolutely actually the chances

1468.32 --> 1474.72
of getting those types of things

1471.279 --> 1475.76
like exponentially enhances the more you

1474.72 --> 1487.76
take it

1475.76 --> 1489.919
yeah don't do that

1487.76 --> 1490.8799999999999
right and then there's that atomican

1489.919 --> 1495.44
then there is

1490.88 --> 1498.64
of course the psychological cult media

1495.44 --> 1501.679
political indoctrination

1498.64 --> 1504.96
that has been grafted into it

1501.679 --> 1506.24
and that's how they all turned into yeah

1504.96 --> 1510.48
from gay zombies

1506.24 --> 1515.84
to transvax zombies

1510.48 --> 1515.84
they're literally grafting it in there

1518.96 --> 1529.8400000000001
mind control right

1530.08 --> 1534.1589999999999
i mean i i i wouldn't be surprised if in

1532.32 --> 1535.4399999999998
the near future there will literally

1534.159 --> 1538.72
just be people like

1535.44 --> 1540.96
chanting and cheering as somebody takes

1538.72 --> 1546.32
it and then drop dead and

1540.96 --> 1546.32
they keep chanting as the person dies

1547.679 --> 1552.64
sounds crazy right yeah oh arwen is

1551.2 --> 1556.24
crazy to say that

1552.64 --> 1557.679
yeah but if you've been around for a

1556.24 --> 1561.2
while and paying attention

1557.679 --> 1571.8400000000001
you know you know that's going to be on

1561.2 --> 1571.8400000000001
the table at some point

1583.039 --> 1589.6
so yes there is what does what the vox

1586.559 --> 1591.279
that's not a vex what it contains what

1589.6 --> 1595.52
it does

1591.279 --> 1599.84
and then there is the mind control cult

1595.52 --> 1599.84
facts cult side of it

1601.919 --> 1607.679
that's right both are equally dangerous

1604.96 --> 1610.4
because the poison just destroys you it

1607.679 --> 1610.4
destroys your

1610.799 --> 1613.84
procreation ability

1614.96 --> 1623.1200000000001
yeah that might be important you know

1618.48 --> 1626.08
for survival of the species and then

1623.12 --> 1629.039
yeah the other side basically makes you

1626.08 --> 1631.1999999999998
dislocate your

1629.039 --> 1632.799
critical thinking and decision making

1631.2 --> 1638.32
system so that you will

1632.799 --> 1641.84
take wild wild risks deadly wild risks

1638.32 --> 1644.6399999999999
or very bad reasons

1641.84 --> 1645.84
right and that's not just the facts like

1644.64 --> 1648.3200000000002
if you are

1645.84 --> 1649.4399999999998
able if they can make you take effects

1648.32 --> 1653.039
like that

1649.44 --> 1656.0800000000002
and still glorify it then yeah they

1653.039 --> 1658.96
could make you do other [ __ ] too

1656.08 --> 1662.0
right so even when the vax called aspect

1658.96 --> 1664.559
like the vax period is over

1662.0 --> 1665.6
and let's just say hypothetically bill

1664.559 --> 1668.799
gates and

1665.6 --> 1669.1999999999998
frochie are behind bars can you imagine

1668.799 --> 1672.6399999999999
that

1669.2 --> 1673.76
yeah that oh not like gonna take 50

1672.64 --> 1675.44
years or something

1673.76 --> 1676.96
to accomplish that with the money they

1675.44 --> 1680.159
have but

1676.96 --> 1681.76
whatever then if the vac [ __ ] is finally

1680.159 --> 1683.5200000000002
over it's not gonna work anymore there's

1681.76 --> 1685.12
no more legal grounds to make that all

1683.52 --> 1686.1589999999999
possible they'll just move on to

1685.12 --> 1689.279
something else

1686.159 --> 1693.279
idiotic and then start making the same

1689.279 --> 1693.279
cultist people do that [ __ ]

1694.84 --> 1701.1999999999998
right

1697.76 --> 1704.399
because once you become a cultist

1701.2 --> 1704.3990000000001
you need orders

1704.559 --> 1708.6399999999999
right you don't make your own orders

1707.279 --> 1711.12
anymore you need

1708.64 --> 1712.5590000000002
input from the outside to tell you what

1711.12 --> 1716.0
to do

1712.559 --> 1718.32
until you die and some of them might

1716.0 --> 1720.24
even become so enthusiastic that they

1718.32 --> 1722.08
consciously realize that and still

1720.24 --> 1724.3990000000001
continue

1722.08 --> 1726.8799999999999
i've already seen that it's really

1724.399 --> 1729.6789999999999
really creepy

1726.88 --> 1730.5590000000002
it's like a ring wraith shining through

1729.679 --> 1733.2
all of a sudden

1730.559 --> 1735.84
like yes i know i'm going i'm still

1733.2 --> 1735.8400000000001
gonna do it

1736.84 --> 1740.6399999999999
okay

1738.159 --> 1740.64
you know

1747.2 --> 1752.24
ah right

1750.399 --> 1754.799
that's good to hear seeking star wars

1752.24 --> 1754.799
yeah that's

1757.679 --> 1767.8400000000001
that that's a much more pleasant thing

1759.36 --> 1767.84
to think about

1771.49 --> 1774.63
[Music]

1787.12 --> 1792.08
until what happens most likely nothing

1790.08 --> 1796.6399999999999
no george sanford

1792.08 --> 1796.6399999999999
i'm afraid that's an out of the question

1799.36 --> 1806.32
like unless they manage to somehow

1803.039 --> 1809.76
escape the spike protein

1806.32 --> 1811.12
gene altering effect like if they and

1809.76 --> 1813.2
like they could have been poisoned and

1811.12 --> 1815.9189999999999
[ __ ] and side effects damaged

1813.2 --> 1817.919
like and no if they survived that then

1815.919 --> 1820.88
the spike protein [ __ ]

1817.919 --> 1822.3200000000002
will over time still inevitably strike

1820.88 --> 1825.1200000000001
unless

1822.32 --> 1826.0
in some way and i don't know how that

1825.12 --> 1829.6
would be

1826.0 --> 1829.6
they managed to avoid

1830.08 --> 1833.9189999999999
that effect that it didn't go through

1832.159 --> 1835.6000000000001
that it didn't catch

1833.919 --> 1837.3600000000001
so that you don't have the genetic

1835.6 --> 1839.9189999999999
alteration you just

1837.36 --> 1841.12
get the poison [ __ ] and almost die from

1839.919 --> 1843.8400000000001
that right

1841.12 --> 1846.08
but i you'd have to be either really

1843.84 --> 1849.1999999999998
lucky

1846.08 --> 1851.36
or well i need more information to

1849.2 --> 1853.2
understand if that happens why it would

1851.36 --> 1856.08
happen

1853.2 --> 1856.0800000000002
i don't know enough

1862.84 --> 1865.84
what

1869.039 --> 1876.8799999999999
oh wait no no no good servant

1872.88 --> 1878.7990000000002
her grandma i don't think seeking star

1876.88 --> 1880.7990000000002
wars would do that at

1878.799 --> 1883.2
that point at this point that would be

1880.799 --> 1885.2
kind of totally mental

1883.2 --> 1888.0
so yeah it sounds like she's talking

1885.2 --> 1888.0
about grandma

1891.2 --> 1894.96
sorry to hear that seeking star wars

1893.76 --> 1898.96
like

1894.96 --> 1901.679
almost all old people out there

1898.96 --> 1903.6000000000001
that aren't like tied in hard core

1901.679 --> 1906.159
protective families

1903.6 --> 1908.7199999999998
or are like from a wizard family where

1906.159 --> 1910.64
everybody knows a lot and are constantly

1908.72 --> 1913.279
testing each other

1910.64 --> 1914.88
yeah most old people and you can't even

1913.279 --> 1916.48
blame yourself you know because

1914.88 --> 1918.7990000000002
just because you're one person doesn't

1916.48 --> 1920.96
mean you can't protect your elders

1918.799 --> 1922.799
from getting ensnared in this and

1920.96 --> 1925.679
there's a lot of old people

1922.799 --> 1925.679
just taking it

1931.84 --> 1935.9189999999999
maybe in a way they realized like yeah

1934.0 --> 1938.96
it is kind of

1935.919 --> 1941.1200000000001
genics thing maybe they'll just be like

1938.96 --> 1943.8400000000001
okay well i did this sounds really

1941.12 --> 1943.84
terrible but

1944.159 --> 1948.96
they're really old they've been through

1946.72 --> 1952.24
a lot might just think like

1948.96 --> 1955.279
yeah me but

1952.24 --> 1957.279
hey if i then maybe someone

1955.279 --> 1959.12
and maybe at some point i'll finally

1957.279 --> 1963.84
stop and i'm old anyway

1959.12 --> 1963.84
right that would be like really

1964.48 --> 1969.3600000000001
yeah pretty amazing

1967.6 --> 1971.1999999999998
old people can be like that and they'll

1969.36 --> 1975.84
just keep it to themselves

1971.2 --> 1978.88
but if they got a lot to live for if

1975.84 --> 1981.12
they still have a lot of health

1978.88 --> 1982.64
and they got a good family that respects

1981.12 --> 1984.559
them and yet there's

1982.64 --> 1986.3990000000001
then it's really tragic if they just

1984.559 --> 1987.76
didn't know if they just got tricked

1986.399 --> 1991.84
because they thought the world was

1987.76 --> 1991.84
better than it really is

2012.159 --> 2016.64
all right but at least you informed her

2014.159 --> 2018.88
afterward

2016.64 --> 2020.0800000000002
well the same goes here for my neighbor

2018.88 --> 2024.5590000000002
lady

2020.08 --> 2028.1589999999999
like the an old lady the old-fashioned

2024.559 --> 2030.24
very dutch but yeah the same happened

2028.159 --> 2032.48
like i had i warned her but it was

2030.24 --> 2034.559
afterward after she's already taken it

2032.48 --> 2038.08
and came up to me all enthusiastic

2034.559 --> 2038.08
thinking she'd done something good

2040.159 --> 2047.1200000000001
but she does realize like she

2043.919 --> 2049.84
she realized what happened

2047.12 --> 2049.8399999999997
and it made it

2050.24 --> 2054.399
yeah she is shocked by it still it's

2052.24 --> 2056.56
like we don't really communicate as

2054.399 --> 2058.24
fluid as we did before she realized like

2056.56 --> 2060.159
there's something really bad happening

2058.24 --> 2063.2
in the world now

2060.159 --> 2066.32
and i personally

2063.2 --> 2066.3199999999997
got entangled too

2070.96 --> 2075.839
get out of here scum

2086.839 --> 2089.839
scum

2091.44 --> 2096.56
show me the model show me the model

2097.359 --> 2101.52
and then the scientific evidence fleur

2100.48 --> 2104.0
of annihilator

2101.52 --> 2106.32
why don't you isolate why didn't you

2104.0 --> 2108.16
find these tests that actually isolated

2106.32 --> 2113.04
what it did

2108.16 --> 2113.04
and then proceeded to take the isolate

2113.119 --> 2120.8
and prove that it actually causes

2117.119 --> 2123.599
the condition they associate with it huh

2120.8 --> 2123.599
did they do that

2127.76 --> 2131.8390000000004
i don't think they even have a fully

2130.48 --> 2135.76
registered claim

2131.839 --> 2135.7599999999998
of having isolated it properly

2136.56 --> 2139.119
not sure

2140.72 --> 2147.2
even if they did like i'm not

2144.0 --> 2148.4
satisfied that they i've not seen like

2147.2 --> 2152.0789999999997
in my face

2148.4 --> 2156.32
like very basic medical proof

2152.079 --> 2156.32
that it actually causes what they say it

2156.839 --> 2159.839
does

2160.16 --> 2163.68
i think they're just juggling with

2161.68 --> 2166.72
statistics i think it's

2163.68 --> 2166.72
all nonsense

2168.96 --> 2172.0
not wearing a mask i'm not taking any

2171.44 --> 2175.599
freaking

2172.0 --> 2177.04
tests and i scoff at people that stand

2175.599 --> 2181.52
in lines to do that

2177.04 --> 2181.52
it's really stupid and useless

2182.0 --> 2186.88
and people that take the facts i try to

2184.16 --> 2188.64
stay clear of them especially the first

2186.88 --> 2192.7200000000003
period

2188.64 --> 2192.72
there seems to be other influences

2194.72 --> 2199.2799999999997
and i will never take it i will never

2197.68 --> 2202.24
take a shot

2199.28 --> 2202.2400000000002
in any sort

2204.48 --> 2215.839
i'll find another way

2226.839 --> 2229.839
hmm

2246.8 --> 2251.3590000000004
all right well adam how do you know it

2249.76 --> 2254.8390000000004
is

2251.359 --> 2256.16
a pathogen because that is like a

2254.839 --> 2257.92
substance

2256.16 --> 2259.68
right that's actually a physical thing

2257.92 --> 2261.359
maybe it's something else that's being

2259.68 --> 2264.64
transmitted

2261.359 --> 2264.64
maybe more has to do with

2268.839 --> 2271.839
magnetics

2272.64 --> 2277.359
i don't think there's like a physical

2275.359 --> 2279.68
infectious element to it i think that it

2277.359 --> 2283.839
has to do with

2279.68 --> 2285.52
proximity to some kind of electric or

2283.839 --> 2287.44
magnetic effect that is

2285.52 --> 2289.359
body inherent right it's already proven

2287.44 --> 2290.56
that we have that it's measurable in

2289.359 --> 2292.3199999999997
people

2290.56 --> 2294.96
i think it has to do more with that i

2292.32 --> 2298.56
think that is

2294.96 --> 2302.7200000000003
a bigger causal influence

2298.56 --> 2313.839
from this perceived transmission

2302.72 --> 2313.839
than any particles

2314.48 --> 2324.16
pronounces well yeah i'm just trying to

2320.0 --> 2324.16
describe it any evidence for that

2324.56 --> 2329.04
well you you'd have to like have a

2330.24 --> 2335.52
different ways to approach that i think

2333.119 --> 2337.44
it could be

2335.52 --> 2341.839
figured out it could be done i think

2337.44 --> 2341.839
probably already has

2343.2 --> 2355.839
it's just not really been officialized

2361.44 --> 2368.7200000000003
oh i wouldn't even call it an immune

2364.48 --> 2372.079
system like that

2368.72 --> 2374.72
as i think that these types of diseases

2372.079 --> 2375.6800000000003
they are now called i think that there

2374.72 --> 2378.48
are just

2375.68 --> 2380.24
mechanisms in the body to clean up the

2378.48 --> 2383.839
mess

2380.24 --> 2383.839
and they come with symptoms

2391.68 --> 2395.68
and if anything the viral body

2394.56 --> 2399.119
productions

2395.68 --> 2403.2
of dying cells and bacterial growth even

2399.119 --> 2403.839
inside the body are not the cause they

2403.2 --> 2407.359
are

2403.839 --> 2411.2
an effect of the metabolic

2407.359 --> 2414.48
transition into the

2411.2 --> 2416.7999999999997
purging state clean it up

2414.48 --> 2417.839
which we know as disease and the german

2416.8 --> 2425.8390000000004
medicine model

2417.839 --> 2425.839
completely backs that

2434.079 --> 2436.88

2479.04 --> 2489.599
what but it doesn't really have any

2483.599 --> 2489.599
genes it's rna it's like subgenetic

2490.48 --> 2494.8
how can it how can like a subgenetic

2493.92 --> 2497.359
particle be

2494.8 --> 2497.3590000000004
tweaked

2547.92 --> 2553.76
asc montreal andrew by the way

2559.68 --> 2564.24
well agm i can't believe that they're

2561.599 --> 2567.599
still doing this

2564.24 --> 2569.5989999999997
like can they ever get their mind out of

2567.599 --> 2570.88
their [ __ ] i mean when it's this

2569.599 --> 2573.599
beautiful weather then

2570.88 --> 2573.599
why would you

2574.48 --> 2578.72
do that when you could be i don't know

2577.04 --> 2581.52
sunning somewhere

2578.72 --> 2581.52
nice weather and

2586.319 --> 2592.56
having a drink nice

2590.16 --> 2594.56
picnic or whatever like that would be so

2592.56 --> 2598.0789999999997
much more

2594.56 --> 2599.92
healthy and entertaining

2598.079 --> 2602.2400000000002
but they probably bring their mobiles

2599.92 --> 2606.079
with them and then they get stuck

2602.24 --> 2608.24
i got a squirt oh jesus

2606.079 --> 2621.599
they just can't get away from from what

2608.24 --> 2624.3999999999996
they are can they

2639.04 --> 2642.319
yeah that came by

2642.64 --> 2651.68
on alex jones show too well

2645.68 --> 2651.68
thank you for your covet label

2660.839 --> 2663.839
right

2665.119 --> 2669.28
what five-sided square

2669.44 --> 2677.839
what are you talking about

2680.4 --> 2691.839
that sounds delightful seeking star wars

2694.0 --> 2698.8
with the sword yeah yeah he had the

2695.599 --> 2698.8
sunglasses on again

2700.079 --> 2702.96
not the first time

2703.599 --> 2707.599
i don't know dude that could be anything

2705.44 --> 2709.839
that could be literally him in his car

2707.599 --> 2710.2400000000002
with an open top and like literally a

2709.839 --> 2713.599
bee

2710.24 --> 2717.04
flying in there right or a bug

2713.599 --> 2719.839
and yeah that can get infected

2717.04 --> 2719.839
so

2722.16 --> 2724.64
i don't know

2726.24 --> 2729.5989999999997
but yeah i did pick up on that a little

2728.56 --> 2731.7599999999998
but

2729.599 --> 2733.839
i'm not always in the mood for that

2731.76 --> 2736.1600000000003
especially like in the early evening

2733.839 --> 2736.16
yes

2737.52 --> 2750.4
but when it's later then no

2746.96 --> 2752.319
like i i don't really like alex jones

2750.4 --> 2757.6800000000003
even all that much when he just

2752.319 --> 2761.119
typically starts the tag or toe the line

2757.68 --> 2761.839
right and he i appreciate him much more

2761.119 --> 2766.56
when

2761.839 --> 2766.56
he really acted with what

2770.56 --> 2780.16
i don't know with with bacteria i guess

2775.52 --> 2784.319
like bugs flies and [ __ ]

2780.16 --> 2786.839
i don't know exactly how that works

2784.319 --> 2789.839
but that's just pragmatic like i've had

2786.839 --> 2789.839
that

2807.44 --> 2821.44
right or perhaps i don't know man

2817.2 --> 2824.16
right well if it flies they typically

2821.44 --> 2826.0
have a lot of like toxic substances on

2824.16 --> 2829.04
them as well

2826.0 --> 2832.319
so that might cause the infection

2829.04 --> 2836.319
and magnetic well hey insects are

2832.319 --> 2838.319
known to have like magnetics to them

2836.319 --> 2840.8
so that's interesting actually to bring

2838.319 --> 2840.8
that up

2842.839 --> 2847.599
perhaps

2844.4 --> 2849.92
but calling it magnetic is already a bit

2847.599 --> 2851.599
troublesome because

2849.92 --> 2853.359
that really puts it almost in the

2851.599 --> 2855.04
engineering corner

2853.359 --> 2857.7599999999998
i don't mean it like that i don't know

2855.04 --> 2859.92
what it is it's just something magnetic

2857.76 --> 2863.8390000000004
electric

2859.92 --> 2865.359
it's like auras right you can read them

2863.839 --> 2868.0
people can even read them but you can

2865.359 --> 2872.319
also photograph them

2868.0 --> 2874.24
that is there what causes that oh i

2872.319 --> 2877.52
think it has to do with like

2874.24 --> 2880.64
energy generated by cells

2877.52 --> 2882.96
maybe the mitochondria or something

2880.64 --> 2885.44
so maybe it has to do with mitochondria

2882.96 --> 2888.64
activity

2885.44 --> 2893.599
it's just wildly guessing now

2888.64 --> 2893.5989999999997
i'm not a full-studied biologist

2898.88 --> 2903.76
action or toxify well when it comes to

2901.68 --> 2906.7999999999997
the fly

2903.76 --> 2908.7200000000003
right any infection

2906.8 --> 2910.2400000000002
will be secondary right you got the

2908.72 --> 2913.52
toxin

2910.24 --> 2916.3999999999996
then the response to the body and

2913.52 --> 2916.4
the activity

2916.8 --> 2929.8390000000004
of the yeah the micro creatures

2921.04 --> 2929.839
the bacteria right

2942.079 --> 2949.28
does toxicity cause infection

2945.359 --> 2949.2799999999997
uh i think it does

2952.96 --> 2957.76
i think that if you increase toxicity

2955.52 --> 2962.319
level

2957.76 --> 2965.2000000000003
gradually then at some point

2962.319 --> 2968.64
something is going to infect it's going

2965.2 --> 2968.64
to start somewhere always

2968.88 --> 2972.079
if you keep increasing it don't do that

2970.72 --> 2976.0789999999997
by the way that's literally

2972.079 --> 2978.0
slowly poisoning somebody to death

2976.079 --> 2979.8390000000004
right if you don't do it rapidly and

2978.0 --> 2982.64
they just die immediately

2979.839 --> 2985.2
just build up crap then at some point

2982.64 --> 2987.2
something is going to get infected

2985.2 --> 2990.24
even if that's like already something

2987.2 --> 2990.24
that's inside of you

2994.16 --> 3000.24
right how i see it is it's

2997.28 --> 3000.559
all these bacteria almost all of them

3000.24 --> 3003.7599999999998
are

3000.559 --> 3006.48
part of your body they're part of your

3003.76 --> 3006.7200000000003
society and then if society breaks down

3006.48 --> 3009.52
in

3006.72 --> 3013.839
poison and [ __ ] then they kind of start

3009.52 --> 3013.839
to do their own thing

3024.839 --> 3027.839
right

3030.96 --> 3034.88
right yeah the word infection is very

3033.2 --> 3037.68
difficult

3034.88 --> 3037.6800000000003
it's context

3037.92 --> 3045.04
i'm using the word infection

3041.28 --> 3046.0
very specifically in the the process as

3045.04 --> 3050.4
in

3046.0 --> 3053.2
within a cycle the infectious phase

3050.4 --> 3054.64
right and that's not holding on to the

3053.2 --> 3056.96
model of actual

3054.64 --> 3058.319
i the idea behind the infection now

3056.96 --> 3069.839
that's just a

3058.319 --> 3069.839
designation of the phase transition

3080.839 --> 3085.119
yes

3082.72 --> 3097.839
difficult to have this conversation just

3085.119 --> 3097.839
over chat like that

3103.44 --> 3106.64
right well kristen

3108.16 --> 3113.1189999999997
i feel the same way from a cultural

3111.839 --> 3115.359
standpoint

3113.119 --> 3117.359
you know france is a lovely country it's

3115.359 --> 3121.04
just the people

3117.359 --> 3125.119
right i can point at reasons why

3121.04 --> 3128.4
history of sodomy mostly

3125.119 --> 3132.1600000000003
but yeah they do

3128.4 --> 3133.76
have good traits too their farmers are

3132.16 --> 3136.839
pretty hardcore

3133.76 --> 3138.2400000000002
they don't take no [ __ ] no they give it

3136.839 --> 3141.68
literally

3138.24 --> 3144.0789999999997
the hoes you [ __ ] with them too much

3141.68 --> 3144.0789999999997
and

3145.359 --> 3150.0
yeah so they do have like a spirit of

3148.079 --> 3152.8
resistance at times too

3150.0 --> 3154.64
and that kind of makes up for them well

3152.8 --> 3157.8390000000004
being french

3154.64 --> 3158.72
sorry that's actually a joke if you're

3157.839 --> 3161.839
from france

3158.72 --> 3164.3999999999996
i don't hate the french i don't it's

3161.839 --> 3164.4
just that

3164.48 --> 3169.52
in the past general experience they were

3167.839 --> 3173.04
not my favorite people

3169.52 --> 3176.16
like i would prefer the spanish

3173.04 --> 3179.52
really but that's

3176.16 --> 3181.7599999999998
that's cultural we could never

3179.52 --> 3182.559
find french people that actually tried

3181.76 --> 3187.119
to talk

3182.559 --> 3189.2000000000003
english spanish would try that

3187.119 --> 3191.119
french would always just expect that you

3189.2 --> 3193.359
would be able to talk french

3191.119 --> 3194.96
and like would not try to adapt their

3193.359 --> 3198.48
talk

3194.96 --> 3201.04
that [ __ ] right

3198.48 --> 3202.96
so yeah nothing too serious yeah and

3201.04 --> 3206.96
they have really freaky

3202.96 --> 3208.559
people crazy people in old families and

3206.96 --> 3209.28
castles and [ __ ] yeah they have that

3208.559 --> 3213.8390000000004
two-hole

3209.28 --> 3216.079
vampiric history old crap

3213.839 --> 3222.0789999999997
but that's of course not all of them

3216.079 --> 3226.1600000000003
france is a really big country

3222.079 --> 3228.48
uh yeah

3226.16 --> 3237.839
no but i've watched that pro protest and

3228.48 --> 3237.839
then it was pretty good

3248.839 --> 3251.839
right

3257.119 --> 3262.1600000000003
yes adam meccan that's right yeah

3259.44 --> 3262.16
microbes

3263.359 --> 3270.0
they can lead to basically creating

3266.96 --> 3270.0
their own toxins

3274.8 --> 3281.6800000000003
but usually there has to already

3278.079 --> 3284.96
be something wrong before this engages

3281.68 --> 3288.96
just microbes and nothing else wrong

3284.96 --> 3289.52
then i think that that really does kind

3288.96 --> 3292.64
of happen

3289.52 --> 3296.16
all the time or regularly anyway and you

3292.64 --> 3297.2
have nothing just your system just

3296.16 --> 3299.68
cleans it up

3297.2 --> 3299.68
easily

3301.359 --> 3306.48
there's no other damage and the toxicity

3303.76 --> 3321.8390000000004
levels don't become too bad

3306.48 --> 3321.839
for your body

3378.16 --> 3381.2
all right yep by the way adam we really

3380.319 --> 3383.52
gotta

3381.2 --> 3384.8799999999997
talk about this some more by the way

3383.52 --> 3387.2
because

3384.88 --> 3388.48
is it friday you really came rolling in

3387.2 --> 3390.24
with that

3388.48 --> 3392.96
after after show after every the

3390.24 --> 3394.8799999999997
recording stop

3392.96 --> 3396.079
and you also said that you're kind of

3394.88 --> 3398.2400000000002
irritated

3396.079 --> 3400.2400000000002
by some other truthers that are like

3398.24 --> 3404.0789999999997
really

3400.24 --> 3405.52
well [ __ ] on medical research right

3404.079 --> 3407.3590000000004
that they're not taking it that they're

3405.52 --> 3409.28
becoming solarcistic

3407.359 --> 3412.4
in the face of the realization that

3409.28 --> 3415.92
there has been a lot of medical fraud

3412.4 --> 3420.48
very typical weak response

3415.92 --> 3420.48
and i agree with that but

3420.72 --> 3426.5589999999997
there is just a lot of stuff

3424.079 --> 3429.28
i think there is i really think there is

3426.559 --> 3433.8390000000004
a massive medical conspiracy

3429.28 --> 3433.8390000000004
i think it has its own globe

3435.359 --> 3438.0
as it were

3439.119 --> 3446.48
so we may need to do like a

3442.96 --> 3449.839
one-on-one show on that sometime

3446.48 --> 3449.839
i really just put it down

3450.559 --> 3455.2000000000003
because i i really do have a lot of

3453.04 --> 3460.079
doubts and a lot of other material

3455.2 --> 3462.64
and models ideas to reflect upon

3460.079 --> 3463.2000000000003
that at the start just completely did

3462.64 --> 3466.8799999999997
not

3463.2 --> 3467.9199999999996
match there was no way to even connect

3466.88 --> 3470.88
it

3467.92 --> 3471.28
to the current medical conceptions and

3470.88 --> 3475.839
and

3471.28 --> 3479.0400000000004
then afterward like two years later

3475.839 --> 3480.5589999999997
the corona [ __ ] came out right and then

3479.04 --> 3484.4
it became even more apparent that

3480.559 --> 3484.4
there's bullshitting going on right so

3484.48 --> 3490.16
like this is a process that had been

3486.559 --> 3490.1600000000003
going for a long time already

3494.72 --> 3499.4399999999996
the viruses do not exist well they make

3497.599 --> 3502.0
it up

3499.44 --> 3504.2400000000002
well they deleted that show by the way

3502.0 --> 3507.76
making

3504.24 --> 3510.0789999999997
right they make the virus up

3507.76 --> 3510.079
laugh

3511.44 --> 3520.4
thought it up

3516.16 --> 3523.5989999999997
like to me the comparison would be to

3520.4 --> 3527.839
just i don't know start getting all

3523.599 --> 3530.6400000000003
weird frankensteinian

3527.839 --> 3531.44
and then just like graft different body

3530.64 --> 3533.2
parts from

3531.44 --> 3536.48
different animals together and then

3533.2 --> 3539.2
saying look it's a new creature

3536.48 --> 3540.2400000000002
that's really what that situation as

3539.2 --> 3542.839
they describe it

3540.24 --> 3544.24
was to me that's what it sounds like to

3542.839 --> 3547.04
me

3544.24 --> 3547.04
like it's just

3554.559 --> 3559.6800000000003
like if they could have done something

3556.319 --> 3561.68
really dangerous if it was a possibility

3559.68 --> 3565.1189999999997
it would have already happened with how

3561.68 --> 3568.0789999999997
[ __ ] up these people are

3565.119 --> 3572.4
how easy they are to open that pandora's

3568.079 --> 3576.0
box as soon as they get a glimpse

3572.4 --> 3579.44
there's no way like god

3576.0 --> 3587.839
doesn't give toys out

3579.44 --> 3587.839
that can destroy everything

3596.14 --> 3603.2799999999997
[Music]

3598.839 --> 3603.2799999999997
is if something that does not exist

3605.76 --> 3613.28
oh i haven't even zika

3609.119 --> 3616.4
right yeah i heard about that oh

3613.28 --> 3618.799
fear the mosquitoes and it was from what

3616.4 --> 3618.799
i heard

3619.119 --> 3622.319
yeah can't say i've looked into medical

3621.28 --> 3624.4
data or anything

3622.319 --> 3625.839
but one from what i heard they literally

3624.4 --> 3628.88
poisoned wells with

3625.839 --> 3632.64
really nastic toxins

3628.88 --> 3635.92
and that's what caused all the

3632.64 --> 3635.92
birth defects and [ __ ]

3636.559 --> 3640.96
there's nothing and it never had

3638.079 --> 3643.8390000000004
anything to do with mosquitoes

3640.96 --> 3643.839
that's what i heard

3656.0 --> 3664.799
uh well x320 like

3659.92 --> 3664.799
hello where have you been

3669.04 --> 3673.359
like why are you interested in my

3671.76 --> 3675.0400000000004
thoughts about that isn't that just

3673.359 --> 3676.72
blatantly obvious what i think about

3675.04 --> 3680.079
that

3676.72 --> 3681.52
yeah hello there reinforce science

3680.079 --> 3683.6800000000003
fiction

3681.52 --> 3685.92
like interstellar i love the movie but

3683.68 --> 3689.5989999999997
it is a giant

3685.92 --> 3691.76
science fiction experiment to see

3689.599 --> 3693.839
how they can represent science fiction

3691.76 --> 3698.2400000000002
concept and of course the globe is one

3693.839 --> 3702.88
of them

3698.24 --> 3706.319
and so is like the wormhole thing

3702.88 --> 3711.119
and so is like the super heavy

3706.319 --> 3714.0
is it the super heavy gravity sun

3711.119 --> 3715.039
they're all one by one the whole thing

3714.0 --> 3719.119
was a giant

3715.039 --> 3723.3590000000004
roll out of mind experiments

3719.119 --> 3725.52
and it was great i loved it for that

3723.359 --> 3729.2
and i loved how they put in there like

3725.52 --> 3729.2
oh we we gotta solve

3729.76 --> 3735.6800000000003
is it the two body problem with gravity

3733.28 --> 3737.52
basically we have to figure out what

3735.68 --> 3740.799
gravity is

3737.52 --> 3741.599
just put it in there loved it loved that

3740.799 --> 3744.16
movie

3741.599 --> 3746.4
for the science fiction piece that it

3744.16 --> 3746.3999999999996
was

3747.14 --> 3754.0789999999997
[Music]

3748.72 --> 3756.64
it is mk ultra how how is it mk ultra

3754.079 --> 3757.119
is it going to trigger do you know what

3756.64 --> 3769.839
mk

3757.119 --> 3769.839
ultra is

3780.839 --> 3783.839
nonsense

3785.359 --> 3792.799
dude they've all that's been said

3789.52 --> 3794.079
forever has been warned about forever

3792.799 --> 3797.68
it's not gonna happen

3794.079 --> 3800.6400000000003
if and anything any next proceeding

3797.68 --> 3801.9199999999996
worst vaccines no paper money mark of

3800.64 --> 3804.96
the beast

3801.92 --> 3808.4
uploading into the matrix blah blah blah

3804.96 --> 3809.28
yeah guess what it's only going to be

3808.4 --> 3812.2400000000002
for those that

3809.28 --> 3813.92
actually become part of that that choose

3812.24 --> 3818.0789999999997
that

3813.92 --> 3821.839
never going to be everyone never

3818.079 --> 3825.599
ever understand not

3821.839 --> 3828.4
in this age come back in the next

3825.599 --> 3828.4
thousand years

3833.68 --> 3838.0789999999997
they'll talk about it forever they will

3835.839 --> 3841.119
indoctrinate you

3838.079 --> 3844.1600000000003
completely and utterly from every side

3841.119 --> 3847.359
until you believe that that is all true

3844.16 --> 3849.2
never realizing that you that

3847.359 --> 3852.0789999999997
nothing about it actually happens to

3849.2 --> 3852.0789999999997
anybody you know

3855.2 --> 3859.0389999999998
it's virtual end times

3861.68 --> 3868.0
only for those that want it

3864.72 --> 3868.48
for those that choose it those that are

3868.0 --> 3880.96
full

3868.48 --> 3884.72
into it

3880.96 --> 3887.119
yeah a lumpy gas in a vacuum

3884.72 --> 3890.8799999999997
so you still haven't explained what mk

3887.119 --> 3893.119
outreach you like to say it a lot

3890.88 --> 3894.7200000000003
but that's like oh everybody's says

3893.119 --> 3897.28
shoes

3894.72 --> 3898.64
so do you know what a chill is right so

3897.28 --> 3902.1600000000003
you're saying oh hello

3898.64 --> 3906.319
i'm good so do you know what mk ultra is

3902.16 --> 3906.319
or did you just find a new word

3906.64 --> 3912.4
and now you think everything is that

3909.2 --> 3912.3999999999996
like a six-year-old

3913.839 --> 3920.799
mind control oh yeah mk ultra is

3916.96 --> 3922.799
mindful so well that that immediately

3920.799 --> 3924.48
explains everything i don't need any

3922.799 --> 3928.079
more clarification than that

3924.48 --> 3932.079
it's mind control yeah because

3928.079 --> 3935.3590000000004
that's so narrow like there's only one

3932.079 --> 3939.28
you know it's just mind control

3935.359 --> 3941.52
oh oh so you don't know what is it

3939.28 --> 3942.4
what is mk ultra what do they actually

3941.52 --> 3945.839
do

3942.4 --> 3948.079
what did they do how did they do it

3945.839 --> 3950.64
how does that apply what they did to

3948.079 --> 3952.88
what they're doing now are you seeing

3950.64 --> 3955.92
the results that directly correlate to

3952.88 --> 3955.92
the same scenarios

3957.119 --> 3963.28
i mean i'm not saying that it isn't

3960.319 --> 3964.079
i'm just saying hey do you know what

3963.28 --> 3966.7200000000003
you're actually

3964.079 --> 3966.7200000000003
talking about

3969.68 --> 3973.1189999999997
because you didn't sound like it sounds

3972.319 --> 3974.88
like you just

3973.119 --> 3976.799
learned a new word and then tagged it

3974.88 --> 3979.2000000000003
onto everything

3976.799 --> 3981.599
but hey i might be mistaken you might

3979.2 --> 3985.0389999999998
actually know something about it

3981.599 --> 3985.039
just didn't seem like that

3990.96 --> 3993.839
hey

4014.24 --> 4017.2
so that's it then

4019.2 --> 4025.9199999999996
fu is your last

4022.24 --> 4028.799
statement i guess what a shame

4025.92 --> 4028.799
oh no it's not

4030.64 --> 4038.8799999999997
through terror they move groups or

4034.799 --> 4038.88
thought fear based manipulation

4038.96 --> 4048.2400000000002
is that mk ultra or is that just

4043.2 --> 4051.4399999999996
media i'm pretty sure that's just media

4048.24 --> 4052.4799999999996
i think that that existed way before mk

4051.44 --> 4056.079
ultra ever

4052.48 --> 4060.079
started that happened with the radio

4056.079 --> 4060.079
remember war of the worlds

4060.4 --> 4064.799
right that's not mk ultra that's just

4063.2 --> 4067.7599999999998
media that's just

4064.799 --> 4068.319
media creating stories for people to

4067.76 --> 4071.119
believe

4068.319 --> 4072.64
to latch on to and then later reifying

4071.119 --> 4076.0
them into reality

4072.64 --> 4079.44
or trying to use it like

4076.0 --> 4081.599
and grain archetypal analogy examples

4079.44 --> 4085.039
for people to latch on to

4081.599 --> 4087.52
so they get an easy reflection board

4085.039 --> 4089.28
to work with in their storytelling

4087.52 --> 4091.7599999999998
called media tactics

4089.28 --> 4093.76
programming teaching all that is all

4091.76 --> 4096.64
grips

4093.76 --> 4096.64
it's much older

4098.48 --> 4103.599999999999
much older than mk mk ultra is much more

4101.04 --> 4103.6
dramatic

4104.239 --> 4113.759
mk ultra is like literally hiding

4108.0 --> 4113.759
it's splitting you up and then hiding

4114.4 --> 4119.2789999999995
like people in you that you don't know

4117.52 --> 4122.400000000001
about and that you can basically

4119.279 --> 4124.4800000000005
summon forth and then make you do things

4122.4 --> 4125.5199999999995
that the normal you would never even

4124.48 --> 4128.639999999999
consider

4125.52 --> 4129.040000000001
and then when they've done that they

4128.64 --> 4130.719
snap

4129.04 --> 4132.96
out of it again and then they don't even

4130.719 --> 4133.679
know what they did right now that's an

4132.96 --> 4137.759
example of

4133.679 --> 4138.719
actual mk ultra you cannot ascribe that

4137.759 --> 4142.319
[ __ ]

4138.719 --> 4146.0
to general movie activities

4142.319 --> 4148.56
my point added in the movie

4146.0 --> 4149.279
right because that actually requires

4148.56 --> 4152.799
pretty

4149.279 --> 4156.4800000000005
horrific treatment torture

4152.799 --> 4157.2789999999995
one could say right that's not something

4156.48 --> 4160.639999999999
you just

4157.279 --> 4162.64
catch on like oh you get the mk ultras

4160.64 --> 4166.400000000001
from watching stuff

4162.64 --> 4168.64
no be a little bit more dramatic than

4166.4 --> 4168.639999999999
that

4170.0 --> 4178.48
right that was my point

4174.96 --> 4180.799
saying mk ultra no

4178.48 --> 4183.839
it's media control that's what they do

4180.799 --> 4186.719
is what they've always done

4183.839 --> 4188.64
but that's what they did when they were

4186.719 --> 4190.319
newspaper driven that's what they did

4188.64 --> 4191.839
when they were radio driven

4190.319 --> 4195.120000000001
it's what they did when they became

4191.839 --> 4198.239
television driven and it's what they did

4195.12 --> 4202.159
when they became internet driven

4198.239 --> 4205.44
it's what they do mk ultra was

4202.159 --> 4216.4
well into the television vision age

4205.44 --> 4219.0
right but it was something else

4216.4 --> 4221.28
much more specific much more

4219.0 --> 4224.08
psychological

4221.28 --> 4225.36
much more invasive than just general

4224.08 --> 4228.48
media programming

4225.36 --> 4230.08
to give people archetypal things to

4228.48 --> 4232.639999999999
believe in

4230.08 --> 4234.4
that are easy reflection boards for your

4232.64 --> 4237.4400000000005
storytelling

4234.4 --> 4239.599999999999
right you can goad people into a certain

4237.44 --> 4242.159
direction because you use the certain

4239.6 --> 4245.280000000001
examples that they love because they

4242.159 --> 4248.719
grew up with that right

4245.28 --> 4248.719
that's what media does

4248.8 --> 4253.1990000000005
and it's also what politicians do

4251.04 --> 4259.28
although they've become very

4253.199 --> 4261.839999999999
weird with it yeah

4259.28 --> 4262.719
that's what the nobility was really good

4261.84 --> 4265.52
at

4262.719 --> 4266.88
back in the day when they still meant

4265.52 --> 4269.76
anything

4266.88 --> 4271.1990000000005
before they all turned into freaks well

4269.76 --> 4273.12
they already were freaks but

4271.199 --> 4276.5599999999995
then they still had to act like they

4273.12 --> 4276.5599999999995
were actually noble people

4277.28 --> 4280.88
and they used the same system now the

4280.239 --> 4284.159
media

4280.88 --> 4284.4800000000005
took that over they're the specialists

4284.159 --> 4287.839999999999
at

4284.48 --> 4287.839999999999
that type of act

4288.48 --> 4295.678999999999
while the actual ruling classes are more

4292.239 --> 4301.839999999999
concerned with decision making and

4295.679 --> 4301.84
setting the plans for the future

4303.04 --> 4308.48
all right subliminal messaging

4306.719 --> 4310.0
sure yeah yeah yeah that's something

4308.48 --> 4312.959999999999
that they've also

4310.0 --> 4315.04
they learned it all comes with fractal

4312.96 --> 4317.76
thinking right

4315.04 --> 4320.48
it's just how to use a higher

4317.76 --> 4322.400000000001
dimensional insight

4320.48 --> 4323.759999999999
to manipulate people in a certain

4322.4 --> 4325.28
direction than are of a lower

4323.76 --> 4328.8
dimensional insight

4325.28 --> 4330.4
that don't realize how they are

4328.8 --> 4333.1990000000005
manipulated when it happens

4330.4 --> 4334.239
because they just don't look that deeply

4333.199 --> 4336.879999999999
into it

4334.239 --> 4342.08
right lower tier thinkers yeah that's

4336.88 --> 4343.84
what that's meant for

4342.08 --> 4346.239
but they already started doing that like

4343.84 --> 4346.2390000000005
during

4346.96 --> 4354.64
during radio era or public speakers

4351.6 --> 4358.08
way way before that right

4354.64 --> 4361.92
because that requires the actual sonic

4358.08 --> 4364.4
component more it's much harder to

4361.92 --> 4365.76
subliminally program somebody with just

4364.4 --> 4367.5199999999995
text

4365.76 --> 4369.52
and they have a still mind as they

4367.52 --> 4385.84
engage

4369.52 --> 4385.84
than it is to actually do it with sound

4391.52 --> 4394.080000000001
i guess

4397.76 --> 4402.4800000000005
are my new thumbnails a form of

4399.84 --> 4405.679
subliminal communication

4402.48 --> 4409.28
you better believe it oh yes

4405.679 --> 4412.719
i love that [ __ ] i love fractal thinking

4409.28 --> 4414.8
so yes everything i i try to say

4412.719 --> 4416.159
every time i'm like really impressed

4414.8 --> 4418.719
about saying

4416.159 --> 4421.199
something it's usually because of the

4418.719 --> 4424.4800000000005
fractal implications

4421.199 --> 4427.12
so yes subliminals

4424.48 --> 4429.36
but i don't really use subliminals as

4427.12 --> 4432.719
subliminal because

4429.36 --> 4435.199
i just show at connections and even like

4432.719 --> 4435.92
inconvenient connections and just like

4435.199 --> 4440.32
how things

4435.92 --> 4443.52
all connect how that can connect and i

4440.32 --> 4443.5199999999995
love to play with that so

4446.08 --> 4450.88
yeah you could say my new thumbnails are

4448.96 --> 4452.96
a form of subliminal communication

4450.88 --> 4457.04
because there's just a lot of stories

4452.96 --> 4457.04
actually it relates to a lot of

4466.84 --> 4472.4800000000005
information

4469.199 --> 4473.199
right and i also like to play with in

4472.48 --> 4477.12
your face

4473.199 --> 4480.839999999999
attention grabbiness versus

4477.12 --> 4482.0
the exact opposite and can you tell the

4480.84 --> 4484.32
difference

4482.0 --> 4487.04
of course all of you that follow the

4484.32 --> 4490.32
show you can

4487.04 --> 4490.32
pretty confident about that

4490.719 --> 4494.159
but to somebody that doesn't know

4492.48 --> 4496.959999999999
anything about flat earth or

4494.159 --> 4498.5599999999995
owen benjamin or anything that relates

4496.96 --> 4500.8
to what i talk about

4498.56 --> 4502.56
they'll be like what what what and they

4500.8 --> 4504.2390000000005
won't see the difference between like

4502.56 --> 4508.080000000001
the

4504.239 --> 4510.799999999999
elon musk britney one and the bear

4508.08 --> 4512.159
and the sheep one of today's show they

4510.8 --> 4513.84
they'll just think yeah it's just

4512.159 --> 4516.159
attention gravy

4513.84 --> 4518.400000000001
but if you know information if you

4516.159 --> 4521.599999999999
understand things

4518.4 --> 4525.839999999999
what i talk about then that picture

4521.6 --> 4525.84
means a whole lot more

4536.84 --> 4539.84
right

4542.48 --> 4545.44
no x-20

4546.32 --> 4552.639999999999
the dinosaurs were

4550.84 --> 4555.6
died

4552.64 --> 4555.6
so no

4558.48 --> 4565.36
no actually dinosaurs never existed not

4561.679 --> 4568.8
not in the way they say not exclusively

4565.36 --> 4572.08
pre-manned millions of years ago

4568.8 --> 4574.88
[ __ ] that's all nonsense yeah there

4572.08 --> 4577.84
were big reptiles sure

4574.88 --> 4579.1990000000005
confident there were a lot of big things

4577.84 --> 4583.4400000000005
big animals big

4579.199 --> 4587.12
humans big giants so why not big lizards

4583.44 --> 4589.5199999999995
sure why not right there probably were

4587.12 --> 4590.96
there's even pretty big lizards right

4589.52 --> 4593.280000000001
now in the world

4590.96 --> 4595.199
so why not even bigger in other times in

4593.28 --> 4599.36
other conditions

4595.199 --> 4602.08
but there was no dinosaur age

4599.36 --> 4603.04
in their stupid evolution nonsense time

4602.08 --> 4606.64
scale

4603.04 --> 4610.239
that is [ __ ] absolute [ __ ]

4606.64 --> 4613.6
total total nonsense right

4610.239 --> 4614.4
big lizards sure i think there probably

4613.6 --> 4617.4400000000005
have been

4614.4 --> 4620.639999999999
regions maybe

4617.44 --> 4625.12
atlantean age where humans

4620.64 --> 4625.12
would ride really big lizards

4630.0 --> 4634.239
right but that's not a dinosaur because

4632.8 --> 4638.400000000001
a dinosaur

4634.239 --> 4642.32
what it even means why it was brought up

4638.4 --> 4644.32
is super old situation

4642.32 --> 4647.28
creature situation that's really what

4644.32 --> 4650.4
the dinosaur stands for in the story

4647.28 --> 4654.639999999999
and that is complete [ __ ]

4650.4 --> 4658.5599999999995
like complete atheist cr like

4654.64 --> 4661.04
atheist evolution thinking

4658.56 --> 4663.04
total made up satanic [ __ ] because

4661.04 --> 4666.08
the people that were engaging were

4663.04 --> 4669.44
like evil and they knew it

4666.08 --> 4673.04
they were sick bastards

4669.44 --> 4676.0
destroyer of truth and evidence

4673.04 --> 4679.84
to gain power and money and control mind

4676.0 --> 4679.84
control they lusted for mind control

4682.239 --> 4685.839999999999
disgusting people so yeah dinosaurs and

4685.04 --> 4688.08
the ones that

4685.84 --> 4690.2390000000005
invented it at the time is complete

4688.08 --> 4691.92
[ __ ] lies

4690.239 --> 4693.5199999999995
doesn't mean that there were never

4691.92 --> 4706.64
really big lizards around

4693.52 --> 4708.8
at some point in history

4706.64 --> 4710.2390000000005
the controller's height well because

4708.8 --> 4713.52
they wanted it

4710.239 --> 4714.48
they want lizards they want to make

4713.52 --> 4717.84
people think

4714.48 --> 4720.48
that lizards were superior right

4717.84 --> 4721.04
and there in lies something kind of

4720.48 --> 4723.759999999999
weird

4721.04 --> 4723.76
mysterious

4724.56 --> 4730.400000000001
and yeah maybe it is the reptilian

4728.4 --> 4732.839999999999
spirits that some people seem to

4730.4 --> 4735.44
perceive like david ike and brittany

4732.84 --> 4737.4400000000005
apparently

4735.44 --> 4738.5599999999995
that i don't think is literally a

4737.44 --> 4740.639999999999
physical creature

4738.56 --> 4741.84
but a spirit that might be extremely

4740.64 --> 4745.04
ancient

4741.84 --> 4747.679
that actually wanted that that is part

4745.04 --> 4750.0
of the mind control framework that had

4747.679 --> 4750.64
been built for humanity to believe maybe

4750.0 --> 4754.0
they

4750.64 --> 4755.04
were that was their demand to believe

4754.0 --> 4758.159
that

4755.04 --> 4760.0
reptiles were ancient yes there's

4758.159 --> 4763.36
another place by the way

4760.0 --> 4764.719
where interestingly enough dungeons and

4763.36 --> 4767.5199999999995
dragons

4764.719 --> 4770.159
in dungeons and dragons they have a sort

4767.52 --> 4773.360000000001
of soft lord of the rings set up

4770.159 --> 4775.679
elves men dwarfs

4773.36 --> 4777.599999999999
and orcs and but different not like the

4775.679 --> 4780.64
lord of the rings universe

4777.6 --> 4781.280000000001
but similar creatures and then there is

4780.64 --> 4784.56
ancient

4781.28 --> 4787.679
times where the

4784.56 --> 4790.159000000001
lizards ruled over

4787.679 --> 4790.88
man and used them as food and slaves

4790.159 --> 4793.599999999999
really

4790.88 --> 4794.719
that's like official forgotten realms

4793.6 --> 4797.04
history

4794.719 --> 4798.159
official it's even in computer games

4797.04 --> 4802.08
right

4798.159 --> 4804.799999999999
i think that's an accident

4802.08 --> 4805.76
i don't feel it is i think there is a

4804.8 --> 4809.92
purpose to that

4805.76 --> 4812.2390000000005
designations of ancient reptiles

4809.92 --> 4814.08
and i don't think that it has anything

4812.239 --> 4816.159
to do with reality i think it is has

4814.08 --> 4820.8
something to do with that bizarre

4816.159 --> 4825.199
extra-dimensional reptilian spirit thing

4820.8 --> 4828.400000000001
whatever it is the perception of it

4825.199 --> 4833.28
the mindset of it the associated traits

4828.4 --> 4836.5599999999995
with reptilian-ness

4833.28 --> 4839.199
so that's my opinion on that very wide

4836.56 --> 4839.1990000000005
spectrum

4845.28 --> 4850.0
did controllers hide or destroy no they

4847.52 --> 4853.1990000000005
destroyed most of it

4850.0 --> 4854.0
they just like left it unmarked

4853.199 --> 4856.719
somewhere

4854.0 --> 4860.48
for the locals to be concerned about it

4856.719 --> 4863.92
and keep it intact if they wanted to

4860.48 --> 4867.199
or they would lit they've been many

4863.92 --> 4867.1990000000005
there have been many kinds of

4868.48 --> 4872.638999999999
smithsonian workers actually digging up

4871.6 --> 4875.04
giant sites

4872.639 --> 4875.92
and then throwing their skeletals

4875.04 --> 4878.32
skeletons

4875.92 --> 4880.96
in the ocean to destroy it because ocean

4878.32 --> 4884.239
water is going to erode it very quickly

4880.96 --> 4886.4800000000005
like literally officially officially

4884.239 --> 4886.48
happen

4886.84 --> 4892.0
right because they could not put

4889.52 --> 4893.679
giant humanoids in there they they

4892.0 --> 4896.08
couldn't do it because

4893.679 --> 4896.8
humans are supposed to be evolving from

4896.08 --> 4900.4
monkeys

4896.8 --> 4901.52
remember from apes that doesn't make any

4900.4 --> 4904.5599999999995
sense if they were

4901.52 --> 4909.1990000000005
if there were giant humans around that

4904.56 --> 4912.4800000000005
ruins that ruins the suggestion of

4909.199 --> 4915.28
of weakness that they want

4912.48 --> 4917.44
the humans to believe about themselves

4915.28 --> 4919.28
in that reversed world spell

4917.44 --> 4922.239
of reality of what it's supposed to be

4919.28 --> 4925.5199999999995
according to that spell

4922.239 --> 4927.12
right so the giants they were just taken

4925.52 --> 4927.84
out and there were probably a whole

4927.12 --> 4930.639
bunch of

4927.84 --> 4931.52
small hatters that were already like

4930.639 --> 4933.679
heavily

4931.52 --> 4935.52
intimidated and like the david and

4933.679 --> 4937.36
goliath story so it's like okay

4935.52 --> 4938.8
giants take him right that's probably

4937.36 --> 4942.88
how the patagonians got

4938.8 --> 4942.88
[ __ ] over and exterminated

4943.12 --> 4946.8
because there were just a couple of

4944.56 --> 4950.0
squirt boys that just

4946.8 --> 4951.04
they were like their very existence was

4950.0 --> 4954.159
like

4951.04 --> 4958.56
constant foot on their dick they

4954.159 --> 4962.159
couldn't handle it

4958.56 --> 4966.080000000001
right whatever their grabbler

4962.159 --> 4968.638999999999
roots were probably among the spanish

4966.08 --> 4970.639
right i think the spanish did it i have

4968.639 --> 4973.4400000000005
no evidence for this and if it were

4970.639 --> 4975.52
the spanish then it was like spanish

4973.44 --> 4979.44
grabbler class

4975.52 --> 4979.4400000000005
in like renaissance

4979.52 --> 4984.0
maybe medieval times somewhere this sold

4981.92 --> 4987.84
not current day

4984.0 --> 4987.84
not blaming you

4988.88 --> 4996.4800000000005
but yeah they were notorious for being

4992.08 --> 4999.92
very brutal and genocidal

4996.48 --> 5002.32
back in the day during the colonization

4999.92 --> 5002.32
era

5005.199 --> 5009.12
for adam and eve giant humans

5009.199 --> 5016.5599999999995
i don't know i

5012.32 --> 5019.599999999999
don't know demi traveler

5016.56 --> 5021.6
but it's very likely that if they were

5019.6 --> 5024.88
humans that they were pretty big

5021.6 --> 5026.08
so but uh like giant giants as in 20

5024.88 --> 5028.32
meters tall

5026.08 --> 5029.44
i don't know maybe i don't know i don't

5028.32 --> 5033.599999999999
think so though

5029.44 --> 5037.04
i don't know i i don't have a foothold

5033.6 --> 5039.679
to really size that up like i i don't

5037.04 --> 5039.679
know for sure

5039.76 --> 5043.04
i like to think of them being like twice

5042.159 --> 5047.679
the size of

5043.04 --> 5047.679
current day humans that's it

5048.56 --> 5052.96
but that's just because i like that

5050.4 --> 5054.96
that's a personal choice of

5052.96 --> 5056.639
choosing to think about it with the lack

5054.96 --> 5060.4800000000005
of a better

5056.639 --> 5060.4800000000005
grip on on the facts

5060.79 --> 5063.869
[Music]

5069.28 --> 5074.5599999999995
maybe they were colossal who knows

5072.719 --> 5075.84
you know maybe they were like really

5074.56 --> 5078.4800000000005
huge

5075.84 --> 5080.639
maybe some of like the post adam and eve

5078.48 --> 5083.678999999999
stories were actually

5080.639 --> 5086.32
the giants that now

5083.679 --> 5087.84
lay dead and petrified as our

5086.32 --> 5091.04
mountainscapes

5087.84 --> 5092.159000000001
right maybe they were actually the first

5091.04 --> 5096.56
humans

5092.159 --> 5098.96
called colossi colossal

5096.56 --> 5100.400000000001
being a bit warped right now so don't

5098.96 --> 5102.56
put pitting me down on this

5100.4 --> 5103.839999999999
not making claims i'm just saying like

5102.56 --> 5106.159000000001
maybe man

5103.84 --> 5106.159000000001
maybe

5107.92 --> 5117.76
maybe the first ones were just like

5112.08 --> 5117.76
as big as like a continent

5118.719 --> 5124.159
right and they just leave out that data

5121.76 --> 5126.08
i don't know leave out that data in the

5124.159 --> 5128.719
bible it is i don't know i don't know

5126.08 --> 5128.719
i don't know

5129.36 --> 5141.839999999999
could be

5143.44 --> 5151.28
medieval times never happened

5147.04 --> 5151.84
well not in the context that it's placed

5151.28 --> 5154.8
right now

5151.84 --> 5155.92
i mean i i'm pretty sure it was like the

5154.8 --> 5159.92
spirit

5155.92 --> 5163.92
of an of a of an era

5159.92 --> 5166.84
in ways it was real it's just

5163.92 --> 5168.4
it like this there's actually historic

5166.84 --> 5170.88
events

5168.4 --> 5172.48
succinct things that happen in a proper

5170.88 --> 5175.84
time scale

5172.48 --> 5176.239
then some emperor decides oh i want to

5175.84 --> 5178.8
put

5176.239 --> 5179.5199999999995
a one in front of it and then they

5178.8 --> 5182.719
literally

5179.52 --> 5185.679
pulled history apart

5182.719 --> 5187.36
decide okay which events do we want to

5185.679 --> 5190.08
be

5187.36 --> 5192.0
thought about as recent so we will more

5190.08 --> 5193.84
personally associate with

5192.0 --> 5195.76
and what events do we kind of want to

5193.84 --> 5199.52
distance from

5195.76 --> 5203.04
in the past and then after having

5199.52 --> 5206.159000000001
separated the events rebuild it and

5203.04 --> 5208.84
yeah put a thousand years in there right

5206.159 --> 5210.638999999999
it's i think that that's kind of what

5208.84 --> 5212.56
happened

5210.639 --> 5215.36
so that doesn't mean that it there's

5212.56 --> 5216.320000000001
literally a thousand years completely

5215.36 --> 5219.28
made up

5216.32 --> 5219.679
just like blank slate and okay let's

5219.28 --> 5221.44
write

5219.679 --> 5222.719
everything that's in between that's not

5221.44 --> 5224.0
what happened i think that they

5222.719 --> 5227.04
literally separated

5224.0 --> 5230.4
real history and then

5227.04 --> 5232.24
fill it in with

5230.4 --> 5233.759999999999
real things in between there

5232.24 --> 5239.12
[Music]

5233.76 --> 5241.280000000001
and a lot still left out left blank

5239.12 --> 5242.88
were pyramids built by giants i don't

5241.28 --> 5245.679
know

5242.88 --> 5247.36
i think so i think they probably had

5245.679 --> 5250.8
involvement with it

5247.36 --> 5252.719
i mean i can't think of a more

5250.8 --> 5256.639
convenient way

5252.719 --> 5260.8
to carry 20 ton

5256.639 --> 5263.76
solid rock slabs

5260.8 --> 5265.6
other than by really really big at least

5263.76 --> 5267.52
20 meter tall giants

5265.6 --> 5269.76
like i can't even think of any other way

5267.52 --> 5272.2390000000005
to do it can you

5269.76 --> 5274.0
i don't think any equipment even built

5272.239 --> 5277.04
in this modern day

5274.0 --> 5280.0
could do that only thing i can imagine

5277.04 --> 5281.44
is a 20 meter tall giant or like four or

5280.0 --> 5286.239
eight of them

5281.44 --> 5286.239
carrying these freaking huge rocks

5291.52 --> 5296.400000000001
or otherwise it would have been like

5293.6 --> 5298.2390000000005
density neutralizing technology and they

5296.4 --> 5302.32
basically floated those things

5298.239 --> 5305.36
up there but yeah

5302.32 --> 5307.28
or a combination if they probably had

5305.36 --> 5308.48
stone molding techniques at least where

5307.28 --> 5311.599999999999
they could

5308.48 --> 5313.5199999999995
desolidify it turn it into putty

5311.6 --> 5316.56
mold it in the right way and then

5313.52 --> 5316.56
solidify it back

5317.84 --> 5323.679
and perhaps stone casting too

5321.52 --> 5325.120000000001
like they would literally make it like

5323.679 --> 5327.52
cement that would

5325.12 --> 5330.32
turn into what seemed like originally

5327.52 --> 5330.320000000001
cut out rock

5330.56 --> 5334.719
so yeah dude building techniques

5333.12 --> 5338.159
construction

5334.719 --> 5338.159
in atlantean times was

5339.04 --> 5342.4
there were a lot of things they could do

5341.04 --> 5345.6
and they did

5342.4 --> 5349.12
and that we have no official clue of

5345.6 --> 5349.120000000001
that's being kept out of the loop

5349.679 --> 5353.36
we are only taught about modern

5351.36 --> 5356.719
construction

5353.36 --> 5356.719
and limited resources

5362.159 --> 5368.4
but yeah i think that

5365.199 --> 5370.48
giants will probably have been involved

5368.4 --> 5372.48
in the building of pyramids

5370.48 --> 5376.08
and if not in the building then they

5372.48 --> 5376.08
would have probably functioned as

5376.8 --> 5384.0
assisting them in living because

5380.639 --> 5384.719
what i've learned pyramids giza were

5384.0 --> 5388.159
originally

5384.719 --> 5390.4800000000005
electrostatic generators used water

5388.159 --> 5392.638999999999
channels that ran beneath it

5390.48 --> 5395.36
use the running water from the nile that

5392.639 --> 5398.400000000001
was much closer back then

5395.36 --> 5398.88
it would cause electricity running water

5398.4 --> 5401.679
does

5398.88 --> 5403.679
that would basically charge this very

5401.679 --> 5405.28
specific rock types inside of the

5403.679 --> 5408.159
pyramid structure

5405.28 --> 5410.48
and then cause kind of a rock stone

5408.159 --> 5410.48
based

5410.56 --> 5416.320000000001
tesla coil effect that would send

5413.679 --> 5420.159
tension out in the world and i believe

5416.32 --> 5423.199
that this tension would have been

5420.159 --> 5425.12
food like mana to these giants in order

5423.199 --> 5428.0
to prevent them from becoming

5425.12 --> 5428.96
ravaging hungry bastards that would just

5428.0 --> 5431.92
eat everything

5428.96 --> 5434.4
because they were way too big to

5431.92 --> 5437.1990000000005
normally nourish themselves

5434.4 --> 5438.799999999999
not enough food for their size and then

5437.199 --> 5441.04
these pyramids would have probably

5438.8 --> 5443.76
prevented them from

5441.04 --> 5445.76
basically just eating everything and

5443.76 --> 5448.8
stabilized the whole situation and

5445.76 --> 5452.8
were allowed you to keep them around

5448.8 --> 5455.1990000000005
as very handy huge quick workers

5452.8 --> 5457.28
without constantly having to sacrifice

5455.199 --> 5462.638999999999
[ __ ] to them just to keep nourished

5457.28 --> 5464.32
right would make it much more viable

5462.639 --> 5465.92
that's what i think about it that's my

5464.32 --> 5470.719
theory that's my idea

5465.92 --> 5473.52
that i put together through 20 years of

5470.719 --> 5473.52
looking around

5473.92 --> 5477.84
on the internet mostly

5478.639 --> 5481.679
but this would have all been atlantean

5480.639 --> 5485.76
age right

5481.679 --> 5487.6
pre-flood then when the flood happened

5485.76 --> 5489.76
the of course the electrostatic

5487.6 --> 5491.1990000000005
generators the pyramids around the world

5489.76 --> 5492.719
that would have been feeding giants

5491.199 --> 5494.32
didn't work anymore because they were

5492.719 --> 5498.0
covered by water and then

5494.32 --> 5501.5199999999995
can't do that so the giants

5498.0 --> 5503.12
are then floating in water

5501.52 --> 5505.679
and they don't have their electrical

5503.12 --> 5508.88
mana food they get hungry

5505.679 --> 5512.0
they die from hunger and

5508.88 --> 5514.639
right and that's how the

5512.0 --> 5516.239
really large giants all died off that's

5514.639 --> 5519.84
what i think happened and it

5516.239 --> 5522.239
kind of matches even the description

5519.84 --> 5525.360000000001
part of the flood and why it happened

5522.239 --> 5533.839999999999
that's why i think that that's how i

5525.36 --> 5533.839999999999
think it happened

5536.08 --> 5539.76
right well egyptian history happened

5537.76 --> 5540.88
after well that's because yeah then the

5539.76 --> 5544.400000000001
flood goes down

5540.88 --> 5547.84
humans that can just float

5544.4 --> 5547.839999999999
they don't starve to death immediately

5548.32 --> 5554.08
they don't drown from weakness uh yeah

5551.52 --> 5556.2390000000005
under their own weight

5554.08 --> 5557.76
and yeah they just take over and just

5556.239 --> 5560.4
like okay what do we do with this

5557.76 --> 5563.52
ancient tech

5560.4 --> 5565.44
well let's

5563.52 --> 5567.360000000001
just turn it into a giant mystery

5565.44 --> 5569.199
religion nobody knows anymore what it

5567.36 --> 5570.719
was for there's no more giants to feed

5569.199 --> 5573.199
so

5570.719 --> 5574.8
let's just turn it into a giant mystery

5573.199 --> 5578.08
religion and

5574.8 --> 5580.159000000001
make yeah let it feed

5578.08 --> 5582.4
the land and the people because it would

5580.159 --> 5585.44
have still if it was active

5582.4 --> 5586.0
if the pyramids in post floods seen were

5585.44 --> 5588.08
actually

5586.0 --> 5590.32
reactivated by the egyptians then it

5588.08 --> 5592.639
would have still had the electoral

5590.32 --> 5594.239
influence the mana that would have been

5592.639 --> 5597.1990000000005
beneficial for both

5594.239 --> 5598.959999999999
plants and animals so they would

5597.199 --> 5601.839999999999
probably been very healthy if they got

5598.96 --> 5604.159
the pyramid restarted

5601.84 --> 5606.56
if they got it restarted and if not then

5604.159 --> 5608.719
it would have just served as this giant

5606.56 --> 5611.4400000000005
mystery thing that would be very

5608.719 --> 5611.44
imposing

5612.56 --> 5617.04
give this flare of ancient mystery that

5615.28 --> 5619.759999999999
works

5617.04 --> 5622.0
if you are trying to maintain power

5619.76 --> 5622.0
right

5628.84 --> 5634.159000000001
right

5630.88 --> 5636.56
yeah well the difference between reality

5634.159 --> 5638.0
things i made up is that things i made

5636.56 --> 5640.56
up

5638.0 --> 5641.44
i can just talk about them again and

5640.56 --> 5644.639
again

5641.44 --> 5647.5199999999995
reality is i can ban you

5644.639 --> 5649.52
very very easily just like that for

5647.52 --> 5659.84
being a dick

5649.52 --> 5659.84
and you know you are

5669.52 --> 5677.120000000001
oh man our time has flown

5673.84 --> 5680.8
maybe i should have round out the show

5677.12 --> 5680.8
but it is kind of getting interesting

5684.84 --> 5687.84
now

5690.159 --> 5696.0
the fossils of those giants who says

5692.96 --> 5696.0
they fossilized

5698.88 --> 5702.8
why would you assume they would

5700.08 --> 5702.8
fossilize

5710.56 --> 5717.280000000001
wouldn't they just rot you know

5714.159 --> 5720.239
even floating bodies in the ocean right

5717.28 --> 5721.679
sounds disgusting like post ship wrecks

5720.239 --> 5724.879999999999
they don't petrify

5721.679 --> 5725.679
they just rot right so why are you

5724.88 --> 5729.04
assuming

5725.679 --> 5729.76
that they would all petrify i mean a

5729.04 --> 5731.679
tree

5729.76 --> 5733.52
might float for a while it doesn't

5731.679 --> 5734.159
necessarily rot and if then the flood

5733.52 --> 5737.360000000001
goes down

5734.159 --> 5738.638999999999
and then it lands up in the mud weird

5737.36 --> 5743.839999999999
stuff

5738.639 --> 5743.84
yeah then it might petrify

5750.88 --> 5757.84
dude maybe there are petrified giants

5753.36 --> 5757.839999999999
out there

5757.92 --> 5761.28
dude there's so much out there

5763.52 --> 5768.080000000001
hypothesis it's not a hypothesis it's

5767.119 --> 5771.839999999999
just a concept

5768.08 --> 5771.84
to us

5772.159 --> 5776.0
yeah thanks steamy traveler for being

5773.92 --> 5785.84
here and being part of the chat i

5776.0 --> 5785.84
appreciate it

5803.28 --> 5808.239
yeah jim i don't know about that

5809.92 --> 5814.159
i think i'm gonna go for groceries after

5811.92 --> 5814.159
this

5814.4 --> 5817.44
just take it easy

5818.639 --> 5823.36
i think there's enough biofuel

5823.92 --> 5827.84
produced this show

5834.639 --> 5841.4400000000005
right but i might pop by

5838.08 --> 5842.719
see right i'm gonna round out so thanks

5841.44 --> 5844.799999999999
everyone for coming

5842.719 --> 5846.4800000000005
i hope you liked this show if you did

5844.8 --> 5848.320000000001
then please don't forget to rogen's it

5846.48 --> 5849.44
up and if you haven't already subscribe

5848.32 --> 5850.48
to my channel and hit the bell

5849.44 --> 5853.5199999999995
notification

5850.48 --> 5855.599999999999
so you know when i'm going live it's 1

5853.52 --> 5857.76
p.m amsterdam time in the weekdays and 2
