2.5 --> 10.7
hello and good morning this is episode 8

8.9 --> 16.91
of flat earth

10.7 --> 19.939999999999998
early-bird and yeah it's a beautiful

16.91 --> 25.21
morning over here and despite some camp

19.94 --> 28.810000000000002
training evening so I'm a bit surprised

25.21 --> 32.14
lovely and sunny bit cold though

28.81 --> 38.349999999999994
great weather over here anyway I have a

32.14 --> 39.92
guest with me already music freak MC

38.35 --> 43.34
hello William

39.92 --> 46.13
thank you for joining the way to play

43.34 --> 50.42
DotA beer yes

46.13 --> 55.61
great to have you yeah what can we talk

50.42 --> 57.89
about you were explaining to me a

55.61 --> 61.07
certain century you were working on

57.89 --> 64.009
there in South Africa your friends care

61.07 --> 70.84
to share any of that online or a mother

64.009 --> 70.84
could do so now we can talk about that

74.77 --> 81.619
well well it says it's actually going to

79.7 --> 84.38
be started about the beginning of next

81.619 --> 87.709
year we looking at buying a plot to set

84.38 --> 89.44999999999999
up a greenhouse cafÃ© work in conjunction

87.709 --> 94.10000000000001
of the legalizing of marijuana in our

89.45 --> 96.279
country yeah it's legal there when did

94.1 --> 96.279
that happen

96.369 --> 102.259
three months ago never even heard there

100.279 --> 107.24
was a quote there was a court ruling

102.259 --> 109.729
legalizing it by the High Court after

107.24 --> 118.69999999999999
about it was basically a couple who

109.729 --> 122.149
challenged to call sorry in a fee this

118.7 --> 124.669
was a this was the result of a joke from

122.149 --> 127.789
jo'burg or Cape Town I think not sure

124.669 --> 129.95
where they offer who opened up a case at

127.789 --> 131.269
the High Court in about I think it was

129.95 --> 134.78
about a five or six year long court

131.269 --> 139.08
battle for the legalization Wow

134.78 --> 140.22
and yeah yes the court gave the ruling

139.08 --> 144.12
three months ago

140.22 --> 146.099
well maybe even two months ago that is

144.12 --> 149.34
now officially and possessed on your

146.099 --> 153.75
property amazing

149.34 --> 156.12
how about selling in Salinas motivated

153.75 --> 161.879
like shops and that you would have to

156.12 --> 163.799
get a special license to operate this

161.879 --> 167.73
door over an amount of weed because you

163.799 --> 175.31900000000002
are limited to about 3 kgs per household

167.73 --> 178.2
at okay so how about like say a selling

175.319 --> 182.25
shop is buying up large quantities is

178.2 --> 183.92999999999998
that legal if you have if you have you

182.25 --> 186.12
all your permits in place yes you could

183.93 --> 191.73000000000002
get that in place in fact we've had a

186.12 --> 195.48000000000002
legal government the marijuana project

191.73 --> 201.0
in this country since 1996 and that

195.48 --> 203.72
marijuana research Wow so that sounds

201.0 --> 206.34
very similar to the Dutch system except

203.72 --> 208.849
yeah the South African actually move

206.34 --> 213.72
forward now because we're still stuck

208.849 --> 215.88
the same nonsense that cops can legally

213.72 --> 221.099
sell here but they can't actually

215.88 --> 223.079
legally buy it's ridiculous I know we

221.099 --> 226.98
are allowed to grow only not like to

223.079 --> 228.51000000000002
look normal accepting for confines of

226.98 --> 231.69
the store normal like selling is not

228.51 --> 235.41
allowed but if you have guys come over

231.69 --> 237.299
and they know they're by your house and

235.41 --> 238.53
they buy some of your stuff they're not

237.299 --> 241.68
going to see anything wrong with that

238.53 --> 243.18
because that's on your property right

241.68 --> 245.639
where you are that's legal here too if

243.18 --> 248.669
you're for your own consumption I think

245.639 --> 253.31
everyone can grow three plants as long

248.669 --> 255.66000000000003
as it doesn't bother anyone it's a very

253.31 --> 257.549
important rule because if somebody

255.66 --> 260.269
complains about it then yeah the police

257.549 --> 264.92999999999995
may be inclined to just take it away

260.269 --> 265.67
it's very annoying yeah all depends on

264.93 --> 270.5
the

265.67 --> 273.33000000000004
like the opinions of the agents though

270.5 --> 276.0
that is true if you look at it also in

273.33 --> 276.78
the context I mean as a cultivator

276.0 --> 279.45
myself

276.78 --> 281.84999999999997
I mean I've learned to process now

279.45 --> 288.3
germination of a seed in soil can take

281.85 --> 290.61
up to 14 days at times I've managed to

288.3 --> 299.0
cut that down to about five so a new

290.61 --> 306.06
germination process to bring up these

299.0 --> 308.04
like heavy subjects in the morning what

306.06 --> 313.14
you have to think yeah he's talking

308.04 --> 317.07
about South African whites a genocide uh

313.14 --> 320.01
okay and I've any any signs of that like

317.07 --> 323.99
is there like orbit is there an increase

320.01 --> 328.08
in racism going on that you can notice

323.99 --> 332.25
only the only problem this country has

328.08 --> 338.34
in terms of a political power trying to

332.25 --> 340.35
get rid of one nation would be a party

338.34 --> 342.57
referred to as the EFA if later only

340.35 --> 346.86
people who are against the whites

342.57 --> 349.8
basically in terms of how they depict

346.86 --> 351.48
and everything we do is racist but they

349.8 --> 354.3
can say whatever we want but and if we

351.48 --> 355.98
say anything to they can say whatever

354.3 --> 357.74
they want and it's not racist but if we

355.98 --> 360.33000000000004
say something then we are being racist I

357.74 --> 363.92
don't understand why such a political

360.33 --> 366.39
party would be allowed to exist

363.92 --> 370.83000000000004
unfortunately unfortunately in this

366.39 --> 372.57
country we have a policy of as long as

370.83 --> 377.76
you can build a following you can create

372.57 --> 380.7
your own party yeah that's fine but and

377.76 --> 384.84
like if you literally it's very same

380.7 --> 387.53999999999996
person and used to be but if your

384.84 --> 390.17999999999995
foundation is the foundations of a party

387.54 --> 393.93
promote racism of some kind against a

390.18 --> 397.62
safe specific group that's not allowed

393.93 --> 401.82
here in the Netherlands for good luck

397.62 --> 403.52
let's not be is like the same party this

401.82 --> 406.68
has this thing of where they were

403.52 --> 409.22999999999996
naturalized order forms take away the

406.68 --> 411.6
pawns and why people give order forms to

409.23 --> 413.01
their nation that could work a same

411.6 --> 415.41
routine that Zimbabwe that when they

413.01 --> 417.33
kick out all the farmers work with the

415.41 --> 419.04
farmers and learn how to form the land

417.33 --> 426.44
and then you can use the land otherwise

419.04 --> 426.44
it's pointless you're breaking up a bit

431.75 --> 437.79
anyway yeah rust as being all super

434.97 --> 440.40000000000003
alarmist it's not something we really

437.79 --> 442.14000000000004
want to get into this morning I don't

440.4 --> 444.96
like that kind of subject when I wake up

442.14 --> 448.86
you know two in the evening

444.96 --> 457.77
thank you but first I its middle of the

448.86 --> 465.81
night so I can yeah he's in California

457.77 --> 470.7
you know so come on

465.81 --> 474.42
Rasta stop doing that please I'm serious

470.7 --> 480.59999999999997
dude I'm gonna take away your wrench she

474.42 --> 483.33000000000004
keep on hey let's fight they're being

480.6 --> 485.67
truth to it okay it's just you don't

483.33 --> 491.21999999999997
want to get all super controversial here

485.67 --> 494.09000000000003
I don't want that let's just leave that

491.22 --> 496.68
to debates and other hangouts please

494.09 --> 498.92999999999995
it's about the ID if there is a lot

496.68 --> 501.63
going on the South Africa and the refa

498.93 --> 504.0
component together I follow Infowars and

501.63 --> 506.79
I do get to hear every now and then from

504.0 --> 508.58
what the hell's going on over there yeah

506.79 --> 514.32
there seems to be like a very

508.58 --> 517.71
unreasonable authoritarian crackdown a

514.32 --> 522.4100000000001
confiscation of land people that are

517.71 --> 524.97
just working people that's just terrible

522.41 --> 528.27
repatriation of land without

524.97 --> 530.37
compensation yeah what is just that even

528.27 --> 530.92
if it was with compensation if it was

530.37 --> 533.44
forced

530.92 --> 535.899
that's just wrong you know you see

533.44 --> 539.47
that's not in a lot of countries thank

535.899 --> 542.019
God but without giving anything back

539.47 --> 544.1800000000001
that's just that's what the Nazis is

542.019 --> 546.449
just freakin compensation like yeah

544.18 --> 548.38
you're homeless now go screw yourself

546.449 --> 551.92
Zimbabwe did the same thing and look

548.38 --> 555.67
what happened to them yeah it's world

551.92 --> 559.709
sanctions and lalalala narvik novel the

555.67 --> 561.8199999999999
country is literally worth nothing yep I

559.709 --> 563.7689999999999
mean they're using the American dollar

561.82 --> 570.61
as a currency now they don't even have

563.769 --> 575.139
their own currency anymore well I hope

570.61 --> 580.1990000000001
that South Africa gets out of it or at

575.139 --> 583.9300000000001
least that these people can safely

580.199 --> 586.5699999999999
survive and maybe build something up

583.93 --> 590.4399999999999
like rien ya sell their stuff reinvest

586.57 --> 592.0
somewhere else that's you and say I

590.44 --> 593.86
don't know maybe this just needs to

592.0 --> 596.68
happen there you know this yeah it's

593.86 --> 598.9300000000001
really rough as a somewhere who doesn't

596.68 --> 600.76
live there to say that but yeah it's

598.93 --> 605.3199999999999
something that maybe just needs to

600.76 --> 607.449
manifest and then like so the head as

605.32 --> 612.7900000000001
South Africa can really learn from it

607.449 --> 615.279
and yeah won't let this kind of [Â __Â ]

612.79 --> 618.0999999999999
happen again it's like okay you have the

615.279 --> 621.1
apartheid that was [Â __Â ] up but this is

618.1 --> 623.1700000000001
like the exact opposite and that is also

621.1 --> 626.0790000000001
[Â __Â ] up and then after that maybe

623.17 --> 630.519
things everyone can finally figure out

626.079 --> 634.9899999999999
like okay like either directions is just

630.519 --> 637.6
idiotic and bad bad for the economy bad

634.99 --> 639.1
for everyone bad for the culture so

637.6 --> 643.8100000000001
let's just do it together

639.1 --> 646.38
as always works best let everyone do

643.81 --> 646.38
what they're good at

648.06 --> 655.7199999999999
yes if you look at that in context the I

652.23 --> 657.79
think in terms of countries with

655.72 --> 660.48
politics refika has got the most one of

657.79 --> 662.86
the most controversial when it comes to

660.48 --> 664.529
scandals corruption open government I

662.86 --> 666.689
mean in the space of

664.529 --> 669.949
years almost 20 billion man went missing

666.689 --> 669.949
from government

692.47 --> 705.26
that's re just you know if I'm typing

696.05 --> 707.03
just keep on talking but I'm not

705.26 --> 710.83
generally a fan of speaking about

707.03 --> 710.8299999999999
politics especially in this country

711.97 --> 718.46
because forgot regardless of the whole

714.59 --> 722.6600000000001
term freedom of speech yet you don't

718.46 --> 730.2800000000001
really have that in this country in what

722.66 --> 734.03
sense or just out in the open social

730.28 --> 736.31
media I mean people get prosecuted

734.03 --> 738.92
thrown in jail just for some comments

736.31 --> 739.4
they've made in on the Facebook and

738.92 --> 741.77
things

739.4 --> 746.75
goosed oh yeah and somebody somebody

741.77 --> 751.37
reported it as racist okay so the person

746.75 --> 753.53
gets arrested for what at the end of the

751.37 --> 757.13
day people are entitled to their own

753.53 --> 763.5799999999999
opinions I don't do Facebook and Twitter

757.13 --> 768.89
like because they're completely gone

763.58 --> 770.6
insane yeah most of them have I knew

768.89 --> 773.4499999999999
both but I knew they would like these

770.6 --> 775.99
people you know they were not

773.45 --> 775.99
trustworthy

776.02 --> 783.97
we're all a lot you knew they were up to

779.09 --> 783.97
bat [Â __Â ] you could just feel it of them

788.769 --> 796.779
you know there's so much controversy

791.41 --> 800.019
today indeed that the world is in in a

796.779 --> 808.389
state of friction there's a lot going on

800.019 --> 811.9590000000001
not a lot of movement happening yes

808.389 --> 814.9590000000001
there's a in most respects when you look

811.959 --> 816.9699999999999
at it in terms of countries and

814.959 --> 820.029
especially African countries in general

816.97 --> 823.149
whether whether one speak that would be

820.029 --> 826.299
calling us a lot of them tended to go

823.149 --> 832.179
down at first and then rebuild

826.299 --> 835.569
themselves I mean you look at countries

832.179 --> 837.549
like Mozambique which has a much long

835.569 --> 848.319
which even as a stronger currency in the

837.549 --> 851.439
land sorry I wasn't listening you

848.319 --> 854.41
reading yet yeah and letting myself be

851.439 --> 856.059
distracted and like either I got a

854.41 --> 859.8389999999999
really listening what you're saying

856.059 --> 862.54
because sometimes it breaks a bit up or

859.839 --> 864.509
I'm just not following you at all sorry

862.54 --> 869.559
sorry for being rude

864.509 --> 871.269
no nobody are saying a lot of these are

869.559 --> 874.389
saying these African countries which

871.269 --> 878.199
were decolonize like Mozambique in all

874.389 --> 881.949
these places lot of them in in that time

878.199 --> 884.829
they went down at the beginning in the

881.949 --> 886.54
value of the country a lot of them came

884.829 --> 888.939
back from it but they're just certain

886.54 --> 890.439
countries we just kept following the

888.939 --> 893.709
same path and went down they did not

890.439 --> 901.8689999999999
learn anything from the past and what

893.709 --> 905.1099999999999
other countries did right well look at

901.869 --> 907.749
but it's not that strange though

905.11 --> 910.3290000000001
cuz they have to refined their identity

907.749 --> 915.85
the thing that happens with colonization

910.329 --> 920.8499999999999
or what happened was that being part of

915.85 --> 922.3000000000001
a bigger Empire allows certain banking

920.85 --> 923.8000000000001
possibilities

922.3 --> 927.01
there are banks involved with these

923.8 --> 929.89
countries so in yeah usually an outsider

927.01 --> 932.29
could be have good or bad intentions can

929.89 --> 937.72
then suddenly build stuff in such a

932.29 --> 940.12
country and yeah create potential wealth

937.72 --> 942.64
there or exploit the hell out of it

940.12 --> 945.76
either way and now that that's if you're

942.64 --> 948.6999999999999
then separated again that type of thing

945.76 --> 953.71
doesn't happen anymore and people are no

948.7 --> 956.9200000000001
longer forced to do stuff but yeah now

953.71 --> 959.1700000000001
they have to somehow muster it with the

956.92 --> 962.88
resources that are there or build them

959.17 --> 966.2199999999999
all from scratch and that's very hard

962.88 --> 969.76
because if you're part of an empire then

966.22 --> 972.19
you also culturally kind of get used to

969.76 --> 975.52
that and become dependent on it just

972.19 --> 979.72
happens and then you have to become

975.52 --> 983.1899999999999
independent again so yeah it's very

979.72 --> 987.63
difficult independence

983.19 --> 991.7800000000001
yes a lot of it comes if you look in

987.63 --> 996.25
especially worth like your East African

991.78 --> 1001.35
countries which are still pretty much in

996.25 --> 1003.63
civil war yeah it's a mess I mean

1001.35 --> 1007.62
there's so much going on around around

1003.63 --> 1008.91
these place places you I mean even

1007.62 --> 1010.74
though a lot of those countries some of

1008.91 --> 1012.6899999999999
those countries are some of them biggest

1010.74 --> 1020.57
gold rich and Dom in which countries in

1012.69 --> 1025.04
the world yet they're yet the war helps

1020.57 --> 1025.04
people mind those diamonds illegally

1026.6 --> 1032.52
yeah because if you've seen a lot of

1030.48 --> 1035.1
those places they got like the military

1032.52 --> 1037.65
and they DEFCON four concentration camps

1035.1 --> 1040.34
where they're making prisoners serve

1037.65 --> 1045.24
delivers the net for diamonds for what

1040.34 --> 1048.36
yeah I mean it's a corporate slavery

1045.24 --> 1050.13
system you know a lot of the Dharma's

1048.36 --> 1052.56
get sold to big corporations around the

1050.13 --> 1055.6190000000001
world to fund a war

1052.56 --> 1055.619
[Music]

1056.13 --> 1063.13
you have to black the black market as

1058.9 --> 1064.45
some extreme uses these days well the

1063.13 --> 1067.66
problem is because of all the

1064.45 --> 1073.21
connectivity is that people that have a

1067.66 --> 1076.5700000000002
lot of money and Industry well if they

1073.21 --> 1079.21
allow themselves exploits countries that

1076.57 --> 1081.76
are not so well regulated by just

1079.21 --> 1086.14
bribing people bribing the military and

1081.76 --> 1090.21
just yeah basically apply slavery for a

1086.14 --> 1094.179
profit funding the funding the

1090.21 --> 1096.429
Opposition in some cases helping them

1094.179 --> 1097.38
weapons and things like that in exchange

1096.429 --> 1099.8090000000002
for what

1097.38 --> 1103.65
diamonds and things they may discover

1099.809 --> 1103.6499999999999
yeah for example

1103.8 --> 1109.87
yeah that's it's like a way to bypass

1106.99 --> 1110.89
taxes because if the country was stable

1109.87 --> 1115.1399999999999
and you would just have a normal

1110.89 --> 1119.0200000000002
operation they would demand taxes

1115.14 --> 1119.8000000000002
regulations and yeah corporations don't

1119.02 --> 1123.79
like that

1119.8 --> 1126.54
the big ones yes and considering South

1123.79 --> 1129.82
Africa in itself as well as some of the

1126.54 --> 1131.74
most unique mines continuing we also

1129.82 --> 1137.6789999999999
have one of the biggest uranium deposits

1131.74 --> 1139.84
in the world I'm sure of it yeah there

1137.679 --> 1143.44
are search resources in Africa it's but

1139.84 --> 1146.23
and pretty much everywhere really but in

1143.44 --> 1149.3500000000001
Africa it is still a lot of it basically

1146.23 --> 1151.66
on the surface and a lot of the time the

1149.35 --> 1156.03
greatest way for the larger superpowers

1151.66 --> 1162.15
to gain things from them is to create a

1156.03 --> 1162.1499999999999
state of chaos in account in the country

1166.49 --> 1171.47
sorry I was distracted again what are

1168.86 --> 1175.3999999999999
you saying a lot of the times you notice

1171.47 --> 1179.39
a lot of these Wars is what we call

1175.4 --> 1181.64
controlled chaos yes right the norio to

1179.39 --> 1183.0700000000002
take people off as off of what the other

1181.64 --> 1188.71
people are doing

1183.07 --> 1194.84
indeed wars are always the trigger for

1188.71 --> 1196.46
many schemes to actually initiate so you

1194.84 --> 1198.98
always got to be careful when a war

1196.46 --> 1201.17
starts all kinds of [Â __Â ] can happen that

1198.98 --> 1202.79
you don't see coming that you don't

1201.17 --> 1203.48
expect so you got to be prepared for

1202.79 --> 1206.33
anything

1203.48 --> 1209.059
when a war breaks out it's very

1206.33 --> 1211.6699999999998
dangerous because all people will then

1209.059 --> 1215.809
make their move if they saw it coming if

1211.67 --> 1219.74
they planned for it yeah but

1215.809 --> 1223.7
unfortunately if you look at the history

1219.74 --> 1226.07
i mean i'll us the one government party

1223.7 --> 1228.98
the e FF lewis the main cause for most

1226.07 --> 1232.87
of the problems this curse following the

1228.98 --> 1232.8700000000001
same path that chris horny followed

1233.679 --> 1244.19
national laws everything communism well

1241.28 --> 1248.48
yeah you can have communist nationalism

1244.19 --> 1253.059
or you can have a better form of

1248.48 --> 1257.1100000000001
nationalism that is just look

1253.059 --> 1261.28
nationalism is more a cultural thing

1257.11 --> 1264.52
than it really is a form of government

1261.28 --> 1266.8999999999999
although you can have like really

1264.52 --> 1268.94
nationalism based ruling which will

1266.9 --> 1273.6200000000001
become usually a lot harsher and

1268.94 --> 1277.73
everything but nationalism it basically

1273.62 --> 1282.9499999999998
just opposes corporatism which globalism

1277.73 --> 1284.99
is yes and it's much better much safer

1282.95 --> 1287.21
but also more dangerous because the

1284.99 --> 1290.42
corporations out there are absurdly

1287.21 --> 1292.4
powerful more powerful than countries so

1290.42 --> 1294.98
if you're going to oppose them you you

1292.4 --> 1298.13
are basically opposing an empire not an

1294.98 --> 1300.82
empire drawn by borders but an empire by

1298.13 --> 1300.8200000000002
wealth and

1301.43 --> 1311.76
it like globalism and these corporations

1305.61 --> 1315.6299999999999
they are kind of like the East Indian

1311.76 --> 1317.6
company was in the Renaissance if

1315.63 --> 1320.8200000000002
they're creating a super powerful

1317.6 --> 1321.6599999999999
corporation that have monopolies that is

1320.82 --> 1323.49
what they are

1321.66 --> 1325.98
that is what how they function very

1323.49 --> 1330.53
similarly except this one is not about

1325.98 --> 1340.01
ships and trade routes this one is about

1330.53 --> 1340.01
politics and finance and Industry yes

1341.27 --> 1348.17
yep and it's the greatest challenge of

1345.66 --> 1348.17
our time

1349.7 --> 1355.3500000000001
well guess it's pretty much what they

1352.17 --> 1358.02
say because the one trick was

1355.35 --> 1359.6699999999998
nationalizing the minds is making it

1358.02 --> 1364.62
government properties that pulls away

1359.67 --> 1367.2
from the X like external foreign

1364.62 --> 1369.1499999999999
investors who wanting to invest in the

1367.2 --> 1371.13
mines because they prefer to do through

1369.15 --> 1377.76
privately owned lands into government

1371.13 --> 1380.4
owned lands which is also one of the

1377.76 --> 1382.65
reasons why a lot of countries pulled

1380.4 --> 1385.38
out of investment in South Africa which

1382.65 --> 1388.95
resulted in what they called the

1385.38 --> 1391.95
downgrade to junk status what do you

1388.95 --> 1397.05
mean well South Africa recently not so

1391.95 --> 1399.3
long ago got from the World Bank's got

1397.05 --> 1402.6599999999999
go to downgrade to junk status on the

1399.3 --> 1405.33
World Bank standings meaning they don't

1402.66 --> 1408.809
advise investment in the country right

1405.33 --> 1412.22
that's not that strange because yeah

1408.809 --> 1414.3899999999999
people are if a party in power is

1412.22 --> 1417.0
confiscating land and everything yeah

1414.39 --> 1419.91
then banks are gonna retract because

1417.0 --> 1426.72
that's not a stable economic environment

1419.91 --> 1429.51
it's very logical yes and it's the

1426.72 --> 1430.83
long-term and it's the long-term effects

1429.51 --> 1432.9
of that that is going to affect the

1430.83 --> 1437.07
country

1432.9 --> 1439.71
of course it is but yeah one way or the

1437.07 --> 1441.5
other some kind of revolution I guess

1439.71 --> 1445.98
it's gonna has to happen

1441.5 --> 1448.59
hi Eric is madness anyway hello Eric

1445.98 --> 1451.82
good afternoon or good morning to people

1448.59 --> 1459.09
that are listening here I don't know oh

1451.82 --> 1459.95
all out I don't know are you this

1459.09 --> 1463.37
morning

1459.95 --> 1466.65
yeah pretty good I was listening to uh

1463.37 --> 1469.4099999999999
and Riley as you call him Riley a comb

1466.65 --> 1471.63
Anthony hey I don't know we're just

1469.41 --> 1476.0700000000002
going nowhere let me guess he was

1471.63 --> 1480.3000000000002
complaining about ballers he was talking

1476.07 --> 1483.54
he is right complaining about what about

1480.3 --> 1488.79
ballers bothers Paula

1483.54 --> 1491.1299999999999
well no no he has Miles Davis on oh oh

1488.79 --> 1493.83
he is with a baller yeah their doom I

1491.13 --> 1504.1200000000001
guess Myles is required another chatting

1493.83 --> 1506.49
about lenses and okay anyway yeah it is

1504.12 --> 1509.2199999999998
what it is you know not my cup of tea is

1506.49 --> 1513.84
all I'm going to say I agree I want to

1509.22 --> 1515.09
talk about subjects optics that could be

1513.84 --> 1520.4099999999999
interesting I might want to watch that

1515.09 --> 1522.1789999999999
afterwards yeah it'll be recorded so

1520.41 --> 1525.63
yeah you guys talking about nationalism

1522.179 --> 1527.6100000000001
and that's the subject are you talking

1525.63 --> 1531.63
about the nation state or national it

1527.61 --> 1534.6899999999998
like a nation like behind that says it's

1531.63 --> 1538.13
a wide subject I'm I was mostly

1534.69 --> 1543.3200000000002
referring to the nationalism in as a

1538.13 --> 1548.0100000000002
cultural phenomenon rather than a nation

1543.32 --> 1549.8999999999999
like a government culture right well

1548.01 --> 1554.309
innovation can be a lot of people and

1549.9 --> 1558.9
your region and be wary of corporations

1554.309 --> 1561.6299999999999
and exploit right like keep be aware of

1558.9 --> 1566.3990000000001
the power it's like every individual

1561.63 --> 1571.169
together have power to defend or direct

1566.399 --> 1573.2389999999998
determine the future of the country yeah

1571.169 --> 1575.94
it sucks what's going on in South Africa

1573.239 --> 1580.259
I guess a lot of it what do you call

1575.94 --> 1581.999
it's probably maybe blown out of

1580.259 --> 1586.08
proportion if you're listening to the

1581.999 --> 1588.659
like Lauren southern and Alex Jones well

1586.08 --> 1591.389
I live in question but it is that bad

1588.659 --> 1594.8090000000002
they are confiscating land and there are

1591.389 --> 1595.859
a hit teams just taking down farmers

1594.809 --> 1599.219
that don't cooperate

1595.859 --> 1602.849
it is very Nazi like very very much like

1599.219 --> 1607.169
that just just about I think it was lost

1602.849 --> 1610.289
not there was a form in the meat I think

1607.169 --> 1614.219
it was a three-state who where they

1610.289 --> 1616.919
permit to form a lab in his house they

1614.219 --> 1618.69
kept him out of his home no they may

1616.919 --> 1621.409
lock them in the house and burn the

1618.69 --> 1625.0800000000002
house down good cheese yep

1621.409 --> 1627.8390000000002
yeah really they do that [Â __Â ] yeah you

1625.08 --> 1630.149
know I think this is gonna sound cruel

1627.839 --> 1633.089
and I don't want to belittle anything

1630.149 --> 1635.339
but a long time ago I came to a point

1633.089 --> 1637.859
where I'm never gonna fight over a piece

1635.339 --> 1639.869
of dirt you know if I can I'm not being

1637.859 --> 1642.71
a coward I mean you come in if I have to

1639.869 --> 1645.6589999999999
defend myself that's another thing but

1642.71 --> 1648.739
you know like if I have property here in

1645.659 --> 1650.429
New York if this society goes down the

1648.739 --> 1653.07
proverbial [Â __Â ]

1650.429 --> 1654.779
I'll just go live in China I'll go back

1653.07 --> 1658.649
to I don't know I'm just I'm not gonna

1654.779 --> 1661.08
fight over right he's a dirt it's not

1658.649 --> 1664.2589999999998
just a piece of that sound in that they

1661.08 --> 1666.739
have farms they have likelihoods they

1664.259 --> 1670.049
are no reviving food for the community

1666.739 --> 1672.359
they are providing economy for the

1670.049 --> 1675.149
country and they are being attacked

1672.359 --> 1681.359
destabilized the banking system is

1675.149 --> 1683.129
retracting it is a fascist take it's a

1681.359 --> 1686.339
recipe for disaster that they're gonna

1683.129 --> 1690.119
take they're gonna basically boot out

1686.339 --> 1693.029
and or kill people who have the the life

1690.119 --> 1695.79
skills to grow food and then what give

1693.029 --> 1699.48
it to a bunch of left-wing

1695.79 --> 1701.72
ten people who have no clue as how to

1699.48 --> 1705.06
grow food yeah sounds like they're gonna

1701.72 --> 1706.8
try and then it's gonna die is gonna get

1705.06 --> 1710.1599999999999
ruined they're just gonna walk away it's

1706.8 --> 1710.61
gonna be abandoned that's what's gonna

1710.16 --> 1714.03
happen

1710.61 --> 1715.77
it's gone eventually [Â __Â ] eventually

1714.03 --> 1717.3
what the farmers are going to do is what

1715.77 --> 1719.79
they did and sabab way the farmers are

1717.3 --> 1721.86
gonna say rot you want to land take the

1719.79 --> 1723.54
land but I mean your country go down

1721.86 --> 1728.3999999999999
don't phone us to come back and help you

1723.54 --> 1730.2
yeah yeah no I mean that but that's kind

1728.4 --> 1732.9
of what I was saying I mean if I was a

1730.2 --> 1734.55
white farmer I mean I would seriously be

1732.9 --> 1737.19
thinking about I know it sucks it sucks

1734.55 --> 1740.07
that you've spent maybe generations or

1737.19 --> 1741.8400000000001
even just a generation cultivating and

1740.07 --> 1744.6899999999998
nurturing this land and investing all

1741.84 --> 1746.55
this time and energy but I mean you

1744.69 --> 1748.67
gotta ask yourself just well this is the

1746.55 --> 1752.19
way if this is the way the winds blowing

1748.67 --> 1754.47
bon voyage I don't know that's yeah

1752.19 --> 1758.4
hello yeah but that's really nice but

1754.47 --> 1760.47
you don't have millions invested in an

1758.4 --> 1762.3600000000001
industry that you built with your own

1760.47 --> 1765.48
hands with a lot of people that work for

1762.36 --> 1769.3799999999999
you and respect you and everyone wants

1765.48 --> 1772.35
you to be there okay that's the probably

1769.38 --> 1775.38
have a lot there you yeah for you that's

1772.35 --> 1777.81
really nice you have just a house and

1775.38 --> 1780.72
you can flee anywhere that's really

1777.81 --> 1783.81
convenient but a lot of me arrested a

1780.72 --> 1787.41
lot you just can't just walk away from

1783.81 --> 1789.8999999999999
that yeah all right listen I am very

1787.41 --> 1791.6100000000001
built this house by hand in a year it

1789.9 --> 1793.65
would suck if I have to walk it would

1791.61 --> 1796.74
suck it would tear me apart but I'm not

1793.65 --> 1798.96
good point is I'm not gonna die over and

1796.74 --> 1800.22
I just I'm not gonna die over a piece of

1798.96 --> 1803.0
dirt because that's what it is well

1800.22 --> 1806.22
they're not they don't want to die but

1803.0 --> 1807.9
the problem is is that they are trying

1806.22 --> 1811.44
to do their best to defend themselves

1807.9 --> 1813.66
but yeah if a hit teams just come at you

1811.44 --> 1815.19
all of a sudden I don't know I don't

1813.66 --> 1817.23
know I don't have the answer it's it's

1815.19 --> 1820.6200000000001
again it just comes down to the basic

1817.23 --> 1825.78
survival fight-or-flight it's a question

1820.62 --> 1827.6999999999998
a mob in my view of things I mean

1825.78 --> 1829.09
there's a different approach to Payton

1827.7 --> 1832.3600000000001
just grabbing land

1829.09 --> 1835.87
why not why not have them work with the

1832.36 --> 1838.7199999999998
farmers if you want to learn fun but at

1835.87 --> 1841.12
least learn how to work the land yeah I

1838.72 --> 1842.95
mean you could you could you can do the

1841.12 --> 1844.809
same thing want to be okay if they

1842.95 --> 1846.94
really obsessed with you know they call

1844.809 --> 1849.249
it national let's nationalize you know

1846.94 --> 1853.0900000000001
very you know left-wing socialist kind

1849.249 --> 1854.98
of Hugo Chavez kind of approach okay

1853.09 --> 1858.129
that's okay that kind of sucks maybe if

1854.98 --> 1860.1390000000001
I'm the farmer but let's like work out

1858.129 --> 1861.9399999999998
some sort of cooperative you know like

1860.139 --> 1863.889
you know can you guys wanna okay let's

1861.94 --> 1864.49
nationalize it let's get the train you

1863.889 --> 1867.85
know I'm saying

1864.49 --> 1871.21
yessir nationalizing in a way like yeah

1867.85 --> 1876.2489999999998
but you can you're the expert you can't

1871.21 --> 1878.58
have it you can't do anything like it's

1876.249 --> 1881.1100000000001
like a bunch of twelve here all to just

1878.58 --> 1882.82
hostile take another company it's

1881.11 --> 1885.039
ridiculous I know what's going on and

1882.82 --> 1888.49
it's it's it's insanity it's it's just

1885.039 --> 1890.32
an illogical recipe for disaster so I

1888.49 --> 1892.84
mean that's what it's looking like it's

1890.32 --> 1894.97
gonna be in the end it's a purely ego

1892.84 --> 1897.879
driven matter it's not pragmatic in the

1894.97 --> 1901.33
slightest it's pure destruction in Santo

1897.879 --> 1903.57
yeah it's not it's like most things in

1901.33 --> 1905.74
this country I mean a lot of the times

1903.57 --> 1908.559
why people call and get jobs because

1905.74 --> 1909.73
they have Vee Vee process in place which

1908.559 --> 1911.769
says they're gonna have seventy percent

1909.73 --> 1920.019
African stuff before they can employ

1911.769 --> 1924.22
white people or any other nation well

1920.019 --> 1928.029
look eventually I predict that a party

1924.22 --> 1930.789
be it depending on the Geo landscape but

1928.029 --> 1933.879
if it's gonna get really bad and like

1930.789 --> 1936.039
really serious city genocide type stuff

1933.879 --> 1938.9499999999998
and that could happen trust me it can

1936.039 --> 1941.049
they raised the or they lower the bar

1938.95 --> 1943.8990000000001
constantly it's something they can't

1941.049 --> 1949.119
help this this kind of insane

1943.899 --> 1951.34
behavior like executing groups for any

1949.119 --> 1954.039
reason for ideological reasons that

1951.34 --> 1957.639
migrates to worse it always does

1954.039 --> 1960.039
so but when it gets really bad like big

1957.639 --> 1962.3899999999999
groups will start to interfere and that

1960.039 --> 1965.69
will either be America and your

1962.39 --> 1969.529
or Russia depending on where the Chinese

1965.69 --> 1973.64
it takes notice Cheney's see they love

1969.529 --> 1975.049
South Africa is a very fertile food the

1973.64 --> 1976.7
Chinese definitely have interest in

1975.049 --> 1979.1299999999999
South Africa we don't hear about it a

1976.7 --> 1980.99
lot but trust me they do yeah but no but

1979.13 --> 1983.2
they wouldn't do that because they're

1980.99 --> 1987.74
basically sort of in the same

1983.2 --> 1991.63
ideological group they would just send

1987.74 --> 1994.82
over farmers to do to take it over

1991.63 --> 1997.94
that's what they might actually do that

1994.82 --> 2002.9189999999999
if they think that it's a worthy exploit

1997.94 --> 2004.96
because I trust me these African insane

2002.919 --> 2009.8500000000001
leftists they won't mind

2004.96 --> 2012.3400000000001
Chinese we not racist you have to

2009.85 --> 2015.1299999999999
understand it's the left or unity

2012.34 --> 2018.1899999999998
there's a great video of a factory owner

2015.13 --> 2021.7890000000002
saying they've got a Chinese are Chinese

2018.19 --> 2024.88
people are generally or arginine way

2021.789 --> 2027.9089999999999
more racist against especially black

2024.88 --> 2031.72
people then that's we know that's you're

2027.909 --> 2034.6000000000001
talking about reality okay right leftist

2031.72 --> 2038.409
ideology is not about reality it is

2034.6 --> 2042.34
about some kind of weird so oh okay

2038.409 --> 2044.7990000000002
sorry ideology that makes no freakin

2042.34 --> 2046.389
sense is some good for simplified the

2044.799 --> 2049.45
Chinese over there learn very white

2046.389 --> 2052.5099999999998
people are racist Chinese people are not

2049.45 --> 2054.0699999999997
racist comes down to that okay well it

2052.51 --> 2057.4900000000002
won't take a long time for them to learn

2054.07 --> 2058.8990000000003
that uh generally interacting with the

2057.49 --> 2061.33
average Chinese they're going to

2058.899 --> 2063.5499999999997
experience a lot more racism then yeah

2061.33 --> 2069.04
but that's not the type of racism that

2063.55 --> 2071.73
they call racism that's actually and

2069.04 --> 2078.879
that's not what this is about

2071.73 --> 2080.409
so whose music music freak MC that's

2078.879 --> 2084.129
well there's gonna be more from South

2080.409 --> 2087.879
Africa okay if we just ask you is like

2084.129 --> 2091.06
do you watch things like Alex Jones in

2087.879 --> 2095.0299999999997
this Lauren southern documentary about

2091.06 --> 2100.45
South Africa no

2095.03 --> 2104.09
to be honest uh mainly watch TV a bus

2100.45 --> 2106.8799999999997
internet-based it's not a no no I

2104.09 --> 2110.0
haven't seen that then I mean look

2106.88 --> 2111.35
Lauren Lauren southern she's a Canadian

2110.0 --> 2113.06
you know that she's they call her

2111.35 --> 2115.8199999999997
outright or whatever the hell that stuff

2113.06 --> 2117.62
means she was there Reese was it about

2115.82 --> 2119.9900000000002
maybe six months ago and she put out a

2117.62 --> 2122.24
duct documentary forget the title but

2119.99 --> 2125.0299999999997
it's miss Lauren southern South Africa

2122.24 --> 2126.77
I'm just wondering you know what the

2125.03 --> 2130.55
reality is if it's blown out of

2126.77 --> 2134.09
proportion and how much I don't know

2130.55 --> 2137.51
look these things will be overdramatized

2134.09 --> 2140.36
to make it more visual more close to you

2137.51 --> 2143.1800000000003
like a dramatic movie but the technical

2140.36 --> 2147.65
things mentioned do freaking happen it's

2143.18 --> 2149.8399999999997
as simple as that that is and one of the

2147.65 --> 2151.9700000000003
biggest cruisers that the media is going

2149.84 --> 2153.8
to blow it up to the other countries and

2151.97 --> 2158.6
that to make things look worse than they

2153.8 --> 2159.17
are now but it's a call to do something

2158.6 --> 2161.45
about it

2159.17 --> 2164.27
that's what they're trying that's their

2161.45 --> 2169.37
goal so you over dramatize to make it

2164.27 --> 2171.89
more heart bleeding more compelling but

2169.37 --> 2175.2799999999997
from what I've heard and from what I've

2171.89 --> 2177.71
heard from you William is that the

2175.28 --> 2180.77
actual things happening yeah that is

2177.71 --> 2185.3
what happens so it is all like oh my god

2180.77 --> 2188.87
but yeah that is kind of except it is

2185.3 --> 2191.9300000000003
gonna happen as I predict it's just not

2188.87 --> 2198.25
right away this is a gradual process and

2191.93 --> 2207.37
fortunately AE chocolate hello chocolate

2342.15 --> 2348.17
even oh wait no I had somebody back

years ago

2348.17 --> 2356.969
take out Craigslist and somebody to come

2353.999 --> 2360.2599999999998
kill me in Shanghai like he actually was

2356.969 --> 2361.7400000000002
the computer in Shanghai

2360.26 --> 2364.2400000000002
[Laughter]

2361.74 --> 2371.9199999999996
giving my address and Shanghai and all

2364.24 --> 2374.3799999999997
that it was funny and if somebody really

2371.92 --> 2377.35
wants to kill you I did I don't think

2374.38 --> 2386.7400000000002
it's dependent on being secret on the

2377.35 --> 2388.93
Internet they're gonna whatever the day

2386.74 --> 2390.79
is and what a lot of people don't

2388.93 --> 2393.25
understand you farm it's tough on me is

2390.79 --> 2395.65
that I myself used to be a hacker for

2393.25 --> 2397.66
many years I usually had professionally

2395.65 --> 2398.38
into company records and things like

2397.66 --> 2400.8999999999996
that for people

2398.38 --> 2403.54
I left that industry about three years

2400.9 --> 2404.65
ago so I'm not afraid to talk about it

2403.54 --> 2406.5099999999998
if they're when you come to our hack me

2404.65 --> 2414.55
they take on a person who can probably

2406.51 --> 2419.38
hack into your back door so I could no

2414.55 --> 2421.3900000000003
issues with them coming to try me and

2419.38 --> 2426.28
it's really really sad what's going on

2421.39 --> 2428.02
in South there for good so I had nothing

2426.28 --> 2429.5800000000004
but good experiences as far as

2428.02 --> 2435.28
Commonwealth countries it seems like

2429.58 --> 2441.73
South Africa South Africans relatively

2435.28 --> 2443.5
intelligent and I don't your integrity

2441.73 --> 2447.93
I've had nothing but good experiences

2443.5 --> 2450.04
with with South Africans and tonight no

2447.93 --> 2451.81
policies are a different story I don't

2450.04 --> 2459.19
get on with the Aussies no offense if

2451.81 --> 2461.65
anybody's and Aussie here but a lot of a

2459.19 --> 2464.77
lot of the time I mean Anna's fifty in

2461.65 --> 2466.2400000000002
in the South Africa in general a lot of

2464.77 --> 2468.28
the thing that you found yes we've got a

2466.24 --> 2470.41
lot of in case there's some intelligent

2468.28 --> 2475.6000000000004
people yeah with some ridiculously

2470.41 --> 2478.12
stupid people I've met you I mean you

2475.6 --> 2479.89
just look at their and I you know one in

2478.12 --> 2481.18
our own government for example the last

2479.89 --> 2486.04
car they had the president had a

2481.18 --> 2488.8599999999997
standard for education so what does that

2486.04 --> 2492.82
tell you about they are things happening

2488.86 --> 2494.5
yet yeah I mean my experiences

2492.82 --> 2496.3900000000003
sleep with people who you know go live

2494.5 --> 2498.7
abroad and you know live in next a

2496.39 --> 2505.06
really good a Maine Center from South

2498.7 --> 2506.41
Africa really good people and the whole

2505.06 --> 2513.46
sad thing about this are the most

2506.41 --> 2515.41
beautiful yeah in these I mean we've got

2513.46 --> 2518.98
some beautiful places you can see

2515.41 --> 2521.83
beautiful landscapes and yet they just

2518.98 --> 2525.43
in insist on destroying the country's

2521.83 --> 2528.64
reputation I've only been in Cape Town

2525.43 --> 2531.7599999999998
now very briefly so and just just fair

2528.64 --> 2533.74
like an overnight what day and a half so

2531.76 --> 2535.9300000000003
it was for business I didn't get to but

2533.74 --> 2541.3599999999997
you know I hear terrible things about

2535.93 --> 2544.96
Jill Berg and it's just never go you're

2541.36 --> 2546.19
in Joburg uh no job except ed it depends

2544.96 --> 2548.7400000000002
where you go in Joburg you don't go to

2546.19 --> 2551.1
like places like yoga Joburg central and

2548.74 --> 2553.54
places like that if you are following us

2551.1 --> 2556.06
because that's a primarily dangerous

2553.54 --> 2558.61
area Soweto is okay

2556.06 --> 2560.95
Overton African area it's one in the

2558.61 --> 2564.78
most windy areas domain area Soweto and

2560.95 --> 2567.2799999999997
it's a big tourist place hmm

2564.78 --> 2569.8300000000004
you mean will you say falling you mean

2567.28 --> 2575.23
like why do you mean just like a tourist

2569.83 --> 2576.46
like just foreigner they unfortunately I

2575.23 --> 2578.14
can't amendment see to think that

2576.46 --> 2583.27
everybody is a foreigner is a tourist in

2578.14 --> 2587.98
this country always speak about tourism

2583.27 --> 2589.78
tourism tourism but yet thankfully what

2587.98 --> 2592.75
do you mean by fort foreigner did you

2589.78 --> 2596.5600000000004
mean just somebody this I mean this is

2592.75 --> 2599.32
to the country oh those sorts of things

2596.56 --> 2601.39
we have some absolutely stunning places

2599.32 --> 2611.0800000000004
you can go but it's all about knowing

2601.39 --> 2612.85
we're safe and we're not and and then

2611.08 --> 2614.59
you know it's basically the same of

2612.85 --> 2616.0
every country every country's got their

2614.59 --> 2622.2400000000002
good places and it's got their places

2616.0 --> 2623.78
you know when you go that's the thing

2622.24 --> 2625.8799999999997
about Asia

2623.78 --> 2628.34
is one of the safest places like he

2625.88 --> 2630.77
didn't mean China shake but it's just it

2628.34 --> 2632.9300000000003
really is safe I've never and you know

2630.77 --> 2637.34
being on Thailand yeah but that's

2632.93 --> 2641.5699999999997
because ever brutality because of what

2637.34 --> 2645.4100000000003
the advantages of high-level autocracy

2641.57 --> 2647.3300000000004
is that well I think masters are brutal

2645.41 --> 2648.68
enough yeah everyone will freaking

2647.33 --> 2650.93
behave because they don't want to be

2648.68 --> 2654.02
slaughtered it is basically the medical

2650.93 --> 2657.2599999999998
way I would I would I also said Thailand

2654.02 --> 2661.37
Thailand is a son of brutal well they

2657.26 --> 2664.73
can be anybody can be brutal but well

2661.37 --> 2668.96
sorry but Thailand it's not it's like

2664.73 --> 2672.68
basically military I think it's because

2668.96 --> 2675.11
people I think it's because it's more in

2672.68 --> 2677.3599999999997
an insular like there's a majority like

2675.11 --> 2680.15
you walk around as whether you're black

2677.36 --> 2682.1
or white or brown and you're in China

2680.15 --> 2689.53
it's this is China this is you know they

2682.1 --> 2689.5299999999997
don't have this Western idea of

2690.58 --> 2695.7799999999997
multicultural it's they you know well

2693.83 --> 2697.61
you get in an argument when you get in a

2695.78 --> 2699.6200000000003
confrontation in Asia the first thing to

2697.61 --> 2702.1600000000003
you know oh this is Vietnam this is you

2699.62 --> 2709.54
know they make it very clear that you're

2702.16 --> 2709.54
that's this is not your place all right

2710.95 --> 2719.98
yep and maybe that's I know it sounds

2716.48 --> 2719.98
racist maybe that's the way it should be

2720.25 --> 2726.41
yeah well as I said as a cultural

2723.98 --> 2731.39
phenomena it's good to be protective of

2726.41 --> 2733.79
your group your region your a local

2731.39 --> 2738.35
region even well depends on what you

2733.79 --> 2740.63
deem as a reliable group but here in the

2738.35 --> 2744.13
West we're told that's that's not see it

2740.63 --> 2747.29
that's racist and that's bigoted and

2744.13 --> 2751.1
that's ridiculous it's only when look I

2747.29 --> 2753.73
am well although I am genetically all

2751.1 --> 2757.25
over the place I guess why mostly

2753.73 --> 2761.9
European really but

2757.25 --> 2765.26
mostly Dutch but I say yeah why not why

2761.9 --> 2768.2000000000003
not actually cherish the special

2765.26 --> 2772.21
qualities that some of the white people

2768.2 --> 2776.6299999999997
have uniquely just like any any other

2772.21 --> 2779.089
region in the world has their own unique

2776.63 --> 2781.7000000000003
type of people with unique talents that

2779.089 --> 2783.74
are designated from that region only

2781.7 --> 2787.1299999999997
because that's what the genetics there

2783.74 --> 2789.9199999999996
are so I think we should not necessarily

2787.13 --> 2793.27
keep separated like okay interracial

2789.92 --> 2797.3
marriage fine but don't attack any

2793.27 --> 2802.0099999999998
specific race that is just wrong it's

2797.3 --> 2804.9500000000003
always wrong always yes some people will

2802.01 --> 2807.079
want to be racially pure then you let

2804.95 --> 2809.99
them as long as the visitor is it most

2807.079 --> 2811.6400000000003
population I mean I'm you know I'm one

2809.99 --> 2814.97
of these liberals I have a Chinese wife

2811.64 --> 2816.89
and a half Chinese you know daughter so

2814.97 --> 2819.02
I'm a super liberal yet I get called

2816.89 --> 2821.1189999999997
racist when I suggest that you know I

2819.02 --> 2822.25
have no problem let me go to India what

2821.119 --> 2825.1400000000003
do you see a bunch of brown people

2822.25 --> 2827.45
married with brown people making brown

2825.14 --> 2829.24
babies and salmon Asians about white

2827.45 --> 2831.7999999999997
people aren't allowed to do that

2829.24 --> 2835.16
it's just something's wrong here I mean

2831.8 --> 2839.0
if you know if you're opposed to

2835.16 --> 2840.92
interracial marriage or does that make

2839.0 --> 2849.5
you racist that you want to be with I

2840.92 --> 2851.7200000000003
don't see that promoting this does that

2849.5 --> 2853.31
even be remotely racist I don't know

2851.72 --> 2855.3799999999997
that's what a lot of people suggest

2853.31 --> 2857.599
that's what I'm sneaking I don't think

2855.38 --> 2859.569
anyone suggests that really that doesn't

2857.599 --> 2863.329
make any freaking sense

2859.569 --> 2867.68
so it's only as I said when you attack

2863.329 --> 2870.38
another group yeah when you attack

2867.68 --> 2876.5
somebody based on their race that's when

2870.38 --> 2879.38
you really become racist and if you want

2876.5 --> 2883.13
to keep your what you perceive as your

2879.38 --> 2886.52
race separate and pick your spouses in

2883.13 --> 2889.4900000000002
that race and talk about how your race

2886.52 --> 2891.29
is so great that's fine as long as you

2889.49 --> 2893.6899999999996
don't like [Â __Â ]

2891.29 --> 2897.05
for other races or also emphasize like

2893.69 --> 2900.98
yeah they also have special unique

2897.05 --> 2903.77
genetic properties that yeah that we

2900.98 --> 2905.78
should also respect but we want to keep

2903.77 --> 2908.54
our unique properties that is how I

2905.78 --> 2911.7200000000003
would approaches and that is our I think

2908.54 --> 2915.44
that deep down many Asians also approach

2911.72 --> 2917.99
it because they know their people they

2915.44 --> 2920.36
know the talents they know everyone very

2917.99 --> 2926.75
well how everybody tends to think and

2920.36 --> 2930.1400000000003
feel because it's also very much close

2926.75 --> 2931.7
to each other so I don't know I have no

2930.14 --> 2934.19
problem with that really and I think

2931.7 --> 2939.3399999999997
that this forced multiculturalism is

2934.19 --> 2941.9900000000002
ridiculous I'm yeah all open for open

2939.34 --> 2944.84
travel it's kind of like the tourism

2941.99 --> 2947.75
concept that's fine and people will stay

2944.84 --> 2950.06
and people will get intermarried and

2947.75 --> 2953.57
will interracially breathe that doesn't

2950.06 --> 2958.04
matter as long as you don't force the or

2953.57 --> 2961.55
D or E or the currents natives let's

2958.04 --> 2963.71
just say it like that you know out that

2961.55 --> 2967.7000000000003
as long as you don't force that to this

2963.71 --> 2974.26
purse or like you must marry with

2967.7 --> 2980.6
another race that kind of thing right

2974.26 --> 2982.4300000000003
yeah what's what's the justification for

2980.6 --> 2985.7
this this party I forgot what's and

2982.43 --> 2988.7599999999998
meant whatever it is this this lunatic

2985.7 --> 2990.83
party that wants to nationalize the land

2988.76 --> 2997.0400000000004
what stirred what's the what are the

2990.83 --> 2999.65
basic reasoning behind it because you're

2997.04 --> 3003.34
referring to me AFF do you live smelly

2999.65 --> 3004.9300000000003
most cars yeah neither one calling all

3003.34 --> 3009.46
of that

3004.93 --> 3011.29
well what his whole viewers he wants and

3009.46 --> 3013.48
what the government is also rolling out

3011.29 --> 3020.02
is what they call the pet reiation of

3013.48 --> 3021.97
bland without compensation okay which

3020.02 --> 3025.14
means they can take your land you just

3021.97 --> 3025.14
got to leave you get nothing in return

3025.18 --> 3031.93
okay now that's what they with what

3029.68 --> 3034.93
their whole idea is in terms of national

3031.93 --> 3036.46
adding forms and things like that they

3034.93 --> 3039.64
will take it they don't have to give you

3036.46 --> 3042.69
anything be nice to them near country

3039.64 --> 3045.3089999999997
according to them we came we invaded

3042.69 --> 3047.14
okay I kind of get that I just I would

3045.309 --> 3048.6400000000003
just ask the question okay but for what

3047.14 --> 3053.68
purpose are you gonna farm it

3048.64 --> 3055.839
you been taking Landers you see the same

3053.68 --> 3058.18
thing happened does it earlier with some

3055.839 --> 3059.68
Bob way and the whole country went down

3058.18 --> 3062.2599999999998
because they do not work with the

3059.68 --> 3063.819
formation just kicked everybody out you

3062.26 --> 3067.0890000000004
know it's a much nothing if you work

3063.819 --> 3068.8
together and teach the people because

3067.089 --> 3070.24
the people yes that work on the farm

3068.8 --> 3072.6400000000003
they're freaking people were not to form

3070.24 --> 3076.569
the land but they know nothing about the

3072.64 --> 3078.46
business behind it getting your funding

3076.569 --> 3080.77
getting this getting that actually get

3078.46 --> 3084.52
your products you need to grow market

3080.77 --> 3089.109
world market trading yes I know nothing

3084.52 --> 3092.619
about it's an art of travel it's an art

3089.109 --> 3096.91
of trust and appeal and just being good

3092.619 --> 3100.569
talker all that what's ironic is that

3096.91 --> 3105.21
critical so it's kind of ironic that

3100.569 --> 3109.119
this whole mindset is in fact very

3105.21 --> 3111.91
European based I mean the the idea

3109.119 --> 3113.77
property that we see in the in the

3111.91 --> 3116.25
modern world today is a very European

3113.77 --> 3119.2
thing if you look at the Native

3116.25 --> 3122.26
Americans they didn't have the idea of

3119.2 --> 3124.359
this you know this is my parcel of land

3122.26 --> 3127.69
and I put a friend it was much different

3124.359 --> 3129.25
and in Africa is also tribal very

3127.69 --> 3131.23
different concept so it's funny that

3129.25 --> 3136.21
they're using the evil white men's idea

3131.23 --> 3139.78
of property and they are rejecting it so

3136.21 --> 3144.099
that's interesting I find it is

3139.78 --> 3147.7900000000004
completely they allow insane reasoning

3144.099 --> 3151.7400000000002
to fuel whatever autocratic goal they

3147.79 --> 3154.66
want to achieve so it is purely just a

3151.74 --> 3157.3289999999997
mindfuck trickery what they're doing to

3154.66 --> 3158.95
justify whatever they want to do it is

3157.329 --> 3166.15
well they autocracy

3158.95 --> 3168.22
their disguise look at that I mean

3166.15 --> 3170.89
they're basically logic behind that I

3168.22 --> 3172.45
mean but when they started this whole

3170.89 --> 3174.52
thing they came into power with all

3172.45 --> 3176.859
these things they bought into place it's

3174.52 --> 3178.99
because and they still mentioned today

3176.859 --> 3182.92
even people who would who weren't even

3178.99 --> 3184.66
in love in that in the 60s always talked

3182.92 --> 3187.03
about apartheid apartheid apartheid

3184.66 --> 3188.589
apartheid and you asked him but what do

3187.03 --> 3192.28
you even know about a part out you

3188.589 --> 3194.89
weren't there you did not suffer like

3192.28 --> 3197.02
your parents suffered or so how does

3194.89 --> 3198.94
that affect your life today you're

3197.02 --> 3201.91
living a good love off the hard work

3198.94 --> 3204.67
they did to get the country to your

3201.91 --> 3206.2599999999998
democracy with equal rights or yet they

3204.67 --> 3210.089
turn it around and take away the

3206.26 --> 3214.69
eco-lodge to give their nation the power

3210.089 --> 3217.95
yeah you almost got to conclude that

3214.69 --> 3220.96
what's going on is being funded or being

3217.95 --> 3225.46
being agitated by some very very very

3220.96 --> 3228.52
big globalist corporate bank agendas I

3225.46 --> 3232.21
mean is its corporate disruption it's a

3228.52 --> 3234.69
corporate the stabilization program to

3232.21 --> 3237.25
destabilize the country and then exploit

3234.69 --> 3239.44
well I'm also goes if there's

3237.25 --> 3242.05
destabilization there will be very

3239.44 --> 3245.41
hungry for control and they will make

3242.05 --> 3249.25
quick deals yeah that is very profitable

3245.41 --> 3251.7
for concentrations let me ask most of

3249.25 --> 3255.01
the farms in South Africa's still

3251.7 --> 3259.75
family-owned or let's say small local

3255.01 --> 3262.75
business now guys guys sorry but it's

3259.75 --> 3265.27
almost three o'clock here and the baits

3262.75 --> 3267.609
have already started up I think and yeah

3265.27 --> 3270.64
if we could probably go on for like an

3267.609 --> 3272.47
hour okay maybe we can come back to this

3270.64 --> 3274.5099999999998
subject again tomorrow it's really

3272.47 --> 3278.8799999999997
