6.31 --> 36.39
[Music]

37.55 --> 45.48
good morning welcome to flatter the

41.52 --> 47.129000000000005
earlybird number 264 I'm your host Arwen

45.48 --> 48.779999999999994
and before we start the show please

47.129 --> 51.12
don't forget to share it on any platform

48.78 --> 52.89
you deem fit and also if you haven't

51.12 --> 54.51
already subscribed to my channel and hit

52.89 --> 56.76
the bell notification so you know what

54.51 --> 58.589
I'm going live which is normally 2 p.m.

56.76 --> 61.559
I'm sorry I'm time every day

58.589 --> 64.289
please also support my channel through

61.559 --> 68.85
the super chats paypal patreon and my

64.289 --> 76.979
GoFundMe much obliged and I caught

68.85 --> 81.41999999999999
another PayPal donation this yeah this

76.979 --> 84.36
morning I caught it hold on with me let

81.42 --> 93.2
me find it again it was I think you

84.36 --> 93.2
Julia Bennet so let me confirm

103.729 --> 109.25
right yeah Julie event Julie Bennett so

107.149 --> 113.56
thank you so much Julie Bennett for the

109.25 --> 116.09
support at 21 euros is Wow

113.56 --> 121.7
very helpful thank you for your

116.09 --> 127.909
continuing support and yeah I'll do my

121.7 --> 130.97
best to keep on doing what I do so let's

127.909 --> 133.81900000000002
go through chat for a moment oh wait I

130.97 --> 135.379
completely forgot the weather right yeah

133.819 --> 140.14999999999998
the weather today is a bit different

135.379 --> 144.54899999999998
it's actually not bad at all it's not as

140.15 --> 150.23000000000002
cloudy nice and warm and also really

144.549 --> 155.079
look at that it's so wind still most of

150.23 --> 157.73
the time that you start to hear unusual

155.079 --> 160.19
details of things that you normally just

157.73 --> 163.88
down here because it's so wind still and

160.19 --> 168.41
it's not always sometimes there's like a

163.88 --> 172.22
bit of a gush but then it just falls

168.41 --> 175.569
back to this and so still not used to

172.22 --> 175.569
that look at that

180.58 --> 187.03
you can barely see it any twig move and

184.41 --> 189.19
the cloud seemed to be just sitting in

187.03 --> 194.23
where they are sitting as well I don't

189.19 --> 196.84
see them moving so yeah wait but nice

194.23 --> 198.79
nice and warm it's still a bit moist not

196.84 --> 204.69
strange with all the rain that's been

198.79 --> 204.69
happening in in the last week what's

208.5 --> 216.22
nice all right I got to merit coffee

211.93 --> 224.56
with me today again and tea that's it

216.22 --> 229.21
now edibles I love dirt and that seems

224.56 --> 232.63
to work really well so maybe I just need

229.21 --> 237.13
to do that now because it works great in

232.63 --> 240.37
the morning I found out and I'm just not

237.13 --> 243.31
used to taking it I haven't taken it for

240.37 --> 246.1
a long time I still had it but if I just

243.31 --> 251.8
keep on taking it regularly in the

246.1 --> 259.23
morning then or maybe that'll fix it fix

251.8 --> 264.87
the issue really helps me stabilize so

259.23 --> 268.35
yeah let's get the chat so HM was in

264.87 --> 274.36
Jason McCormack Amanda young of course

268.35 --> 276.70000000000005
Steve the Me's King Ragnar Stephan

274.36 --> 281.44
Helder certain Lord saw sloth of all

276.7 --> 285.49
that one guy yeah good to see you all

281.44 --> 288.99
this Sunday morning or afternoon

285.49 --> 288.99
depending on where you are

292.12 --> 302.419
hmm okay that was something weird this

299.12 --> 306.229
morning by the way I think that the the

302.419 --> 308.94899999999996
church across installed a bell but it

306.229 --> 312.46999999999997
wasn't a real Bell it was like very

308.949 --> 315.729
weird it was the sound of a bell but our

312.47 --> 319.34000000000003
digital recording of it and it wasn't as

315.729 --> 322.669
penetrating it with its sound so realloc

319.34 --> 324.67999999999995
Euler bells they have this strong

322.669 --> 327.25899999999996
resonation and goes through everything

324.68 --> 333.34000000000003
through walls this thing does not it

327.259 --> 333.34000000000003
just was weird like a fake church bell

333.97 --> 347.24
just felt weird anyway that's going on

339.5 --> 352.16
apparently these Sundays no Elvis qu4 of

347.24 --> 357.729
each curve pimp and conspiracy gets

352.16 --> 357.72900000000004
goodie I Karen B of course

370.25 --> 378.12
all right so what did I do yeah they

375.5 --> 383.479
don't think there was any kind of ball

378.12 --> 383.479
busters or anything that I noticed

388.719 --> 392.969
no just premiers of

394.96 --> 402.46
a folder Flat Earth debates I think

398.46 --> 405.15999999999997
anyway yeah oh and Benjamin apparently

402.46 --> 407.77
also had a recording problem so he just

405.16 --> 413.38000000000005
uploaded a video a mostly him playing

407.77 --> 416.4
piano it was really good so I think I

413.38 --> 420.37
stuck oh yeah that was weird

416.4 --> 422.59
Martin lidka had a announcement for some

420.37 --> 424.86
video and then he retracted it and he

422.59 --> 427.349
didn't replace it that was kind of weird

424.86 --> 430.75
don't know what's going on with that oh

427.349 --> 432.99
yeah I went to pay a visit to imagine

430.75 --> 437.44
beyond the imaginary curve for a moment

432.99 --> 439.509
when Ali B was on it so good to see that

437.44 --> 447.49
he's still out there somewhere

439.509 --> 451.81
oh yeah and of course I joined Jose for

447.49 --> 454.81
a moment when Riley was up against a

451.81 --> 457.81
bunch of Glover's and later yeah it

454.81 --> 461.49
became a bit chaotic and rompers got

457.81 --> 464.86
really anxious and in from Posse and

461.49 --> 468.789
then I was a open new room I got in

464.86 --> 471.49
there with Travis and I thought it was I

468.789 --> 473.55
I don't know retrospect how much of that

471.49 --> 479.02
was hurt but I thought it was a really

473.55 --> 482.5
good debate of like a pretty serious but

479.02 --> 483.43
respectful Globus versus flat earthers

482.5 --> 485.889
Travis at me

483.43 --> 491.919
I really liked it I thought it was it

485.889 --> 496.93
was nice so that was interesting so I

491.919 --> 499.12
recommend you watch that Jose's electric

496.93 --> 502.81
universe geocentric Heat eccentric

499.12 --> 506.669
cosmology hangout from yesterday last

502.81 --> 516.57
thing I'm in it not at the start though

506.669 --> 516.5699999999999
so new W don't be rude the hell

517.0 --> 521.979
Riley is not a complete [ __ ]

523.089 --> 532.1
he just likes the details a lot that's

528.95 --> 535.61
all so you can get a bit distracted by

532.1 --> 542.3000000000001
semantics but he's very good at it and I

535.61 --> 545.1800000000001
don't think he's a [ __ ] at all I think

542.3 --> 548.93
he's an asset I consider Riley an asset

545.18 --> 551.87
half from the start despite is the back

548.93 --> 554.4499999999999
and forth issues we had at times and he

551.87 --> 558.77
fight that has been between me and Riley

554.45 --> 562.61
has always been based on principles on

558.77 --> 566.96
some technical issue about physics or

562.61 --> 572.69
that that's always it I never really was

566.96 --> 577.779
personal with I felt I was always

572.69 --> 577.7790000000001
revolving arguments very persistently

578.92 --> 588.3499999999999
right conspiracy cats well look there

585.02 --> 590.36
was a time that most of us didn't really

588.35 --> 594.07
know for sure about one another and

590.36 --> 599.9
everybody has their weird behavior so

594.07 --> 603.08
I'm well I'm quite a curious fellow if

599.9 --> 605.48
you know what I mean with yeah pretty

603.08 --> 608.2700000000001
weird ideas compared to a lot of other

605.48 --> 612.529
people that are still very persistent

608.27 --> 615.41
and well I wouldn't yeah at first glance

612.529 --> 620.75
I would be nervous maybe thought I was

615.41 --> 624.04
an agent too you know so but I don't

620.75 --> 624.04
think he thinks that right now

625.49 --> 636.29
I hope not controlled opposite yeah

634.16 --> 638.93
right I remember now the control

636.29 --> 644.24
opposition thing that was because I was

638.93 --> 649.7199999999999
defending gravity well yeah that's but

644.24 --> 653.48
that case was settled it just it just

649.72 --> 655.399
got us a bit political because of the

653.48 --> 658.36
Flat Earth versus globe earth issue

655.399 --> 658.36
that's all

667.86 --> 674.22
thanks to regner Stefan hell didn't I

670.11 --> 680.1
did my best I did feel like I had a good

674.22 --> 683.1800000000001
grasp and also for some reason I do

680.1 --> 685.86
really like to moderate the group and

683.18 --> 688.8299999999999
optimal eyes everyone's input and I

685.86 --> 690.8100000000001
really really wanted for them if they're

688.83 --> 693.9000000000001
not total disruptors like some

690.81 --> 696.9599999999999
individuals or people with when they're

693.9 --> 700.62
in a really bad mood but they do seem to

696.96 --> 703.9200000000001
just accept it when I do it and I like

700.62 --> 706.47
that because yeah it makes the entire

703.92 --> 710.01
conversation better and I have my own

706.47 --> 711.9200000000001
inputs here and there as well and I

710.01 --> 716.64
don't know

711.92 --> 718.9499999999999
in a way it was almost like what I

716.64 --> 723.75
originally hoped the flutter debates

718.95 --> 728.82
will turn into but it's just one moment

723.75 --> 733.56
and yeah many of the other times Jose is

728.82 --> 737.5200000000001
just a total [ __ ] Joe so I don't know

733.56 --> 739.91
maybe it's just just a moment a good

737.52 --> 739.91
moment

748.07 --> 751.2090000000001
[Music]

754.13 --> 764.72
I Billy was I don't think the Bible

758.54 --> 768.23
mansions models I think the Bible has

764.72 --> 773.57
many descriptions but it doesn't

768.23 --> 776.66
describe the concept of a mall I don't

773.57 --> 779.6600000000001
think there is any complete uniform

776.66 --> 782.36
description that specifically is

779.66 --> 787.9399999999999
designated to describe the entirety of

782.36 --> 794.99
the earth realm in one solid way like

787.94 --> 798.5600000000001
that I haven't I've never seen that yep

794.99 --> 800.89
I mean here Jose show is a mess a lot of

798.56 --> 800.89
the times

804.17 --> 813.7199999999999
[Music]

808.88 --> 818.759
that's right and I can explain even how

813.72 --> 824.13
I was driven back then Elvis Khufu

818.759 --> 827.91
Ravitch because originally I didn't want

824.13 --> 831.3
to let go of gravity because it is so

827.91 --> 834.779
simple and it is really yeah it is so

831.3 --> 836.43
convenient it makes it easier so you

834.779 --> 839.49
don't have to it doesn't have to take up

836.43 --> 843.18
a lot of ideas in your mind so much it's

839.49 --> 846.899
just a very easy theory that resolves a

843.18 --> 848.8499999999999
lot mental wise but and then the

846.899 --> 850.92
relative density theory came and then

848.85 --> 854.16
the way they argued is always the

850.92 --> 857.279
relative aspect as an argument and I

854.16 --> 859.259
thought my god what is this ah I don't I

857.279 --> 861.36
don't I didn't like it I didn't like a

859.259 --> 863.819
relative density concept at all and I

861.36 --> 866.19
didn't like the arguments they had at

863.819 --> 868.949
all and that is originally why I thought

866.19 --> 871.0500000000001
no screw this I'm gonna find what

868.949 --> 874.319
gravity really is I'm gonna go all the

871.05 --> 877.29
way and and like screw the globus no I'm

874.319 --> 882.569
gonna figure out what gravity is by my

877.29 --> 885.87
own ruling stick basically and using

882.569 --> 888.3
yeah what I how I conceptualize gravity

885.87 --> 895.94
because relative density was just too

888.3 --> 900.18
surreal it it's how you called it

895.94 --> 902.5500000000001
relative density is so reduced its so

900.18 --> 906.63
non wide-spreading like gravity is

902.55 --> 908.37
really a giant chain of all kinds of

906.63 --> 910.949
links all the parts of the aberration

908.37 --> 913.35
that suggest this structure to be there

910.949 --> 916.139
so much spread a lot over the place

913.35 --> 919.139
relative density however is so simple it

916.139 --> 922.6800000000001
is so reduced and focused on a very

919.139 --> 925.38
specific element pretty much ignoring

922.68 --> 928.2299999999999
everything else but not pretending like

925.38 --> 931.949
it's not there it's just not involved in

928.23 --> 935.6700000000001
the actual scientific process itself

931.949 --> 939.18
it's and that was that took a long time

935.67 --> 939.8399999999999
for me to really let that sink in that

939.18 --> 942.27
it

939.84 --> 946.0500000000001
was just so different an approach but

942.27 --> 950.13
yet solid viable as a foundation and

946.05 --> 952.8599999999999
then yeah I had to regretfully admit

950.13 --> 956.13
that gravity is just an illusion it's an

952.86 --> 958.35
aberration and then define that and why

956.13 --> 960.74
give a reason as to with the conclusion

958.35 --> 966.21
and I've been doing that for a year now

960.74 --> 969.33
every every chance again and at the same

966.21 --> 971.97
time as I got used to the relative

969.33 --> 977.3000000000001
density concept I just started to say

971.97 --> 983.97
okay look the parameters are very

977.3 --> 987.4499999999999
primitive and direct at it so how do you

983.97 --> 989.7
then build the rest of the structure

987.45 --> 992.9100000000001
that was originally interpreted as

989.7 --> 996.57
gravity on top of that theory how can

992.91 --> 999.24
that work and that's well when I

996.57 --> 1002.75
basically started elaborating and

999.24 --> 1005.75
figuring out way it is the displacement

1002.75 --> 1007.55
is a force and it is caused by an object

1005.75 --> 1010.76
not being in relative density

1007.55 --> 1013.0699999999999
equilibrium and that means that the

1010.76 --> 1015.8
relative density of the object or the

1013.07 --> 1018.589
the mash whatever it is it's relative

1015.8 --> 1021.0799999999999
density is not the same as the relative

1018.589 --> 1024.53
density of the medium it is resting in

1021.08 --> 1028.6100000000001
and that causes then the displacement

1024.53 --> 1031.4289999999999
that causes the acceleration and with

1028.61 --> 1034.31
friction elements causing maximum

1031.429 --> 1036.1100000000001
velocity in its motion and then you have

1034.31 --> 1038.1499999999999
of course the cohesion factors will it

1036.11 --> 1046.4589999999998
split apart as it's traveling or will it

1038.15 --> 1049.0700000000002
stay as one and once an object is or an

1046.459 --> 1052.46
object or a body is then prevented from

1049.07 --> 1056.87
moving because there is something solid

1052.46 --> 1059.69
in the way and it can't displace then it

1056.87 --> 1061.2199999999998
is still in this equilibrium compared to

1059.69 --> 1063.55
the environment surrounding it there's

1061.22 --> 1066.59
something simply obstructing the travel

1063.55 --> 1070.31
putting a brake on that and then that

1066.59 --> 1072.72
same this equilibrium is still a force

1070.31 --> 1075.75
it's still it's still in this equally

1072.72 --> 1077.3700000000001
in relation to its medium so then the

1075.75 --> 1080.009
force instead because of lack of

1077.37 --> 1082.32
maneuverability is translated in the

1080.009 --> 1084.83
push in the pressure still wanting to go

1082.32 --> 1087.96
there and then pressure is locally

1084.83 --> 1094.9189999999999
registered even so it fits it fits

1087.96 --> 1098.759
completely it fits now because I started

1094.919 --> 1102.029
to get it because I dare to say yes

1098.759 --> 1108.929
relative density disequilibrium causes

1102.029 --> 1111.57
force pen and the maneuverability and

1108.929 --> 1113.46
also getting the the misunderstanding

1111.57 --> 1116.1899999999998
out of the way that it is purely

1113.46 --> 1119.19
dependent on the medium the object

1116.19 --> 1122.159
sitting in and that it doesn't go away

1119.19 --> 1126.8990000000001
just because it can't move anymore two

1122.159 --> 1129.21
words its equilibrium point and all that

1126.899 --> 1132.149
so yeah it is complicated it's pretty

1129.21 --> 1134.759
complicated construct more complicated

1132.149 --> 1137.279
than if you would presuppose gravity and

1134.759 --> 1141.169
explain a lot of things like that the

1137.279 --> 1146.299
big difference is relative density works

1141.169 --> 1150.24
scientifically and that's a huge plus

1146.299 --> 1155.7
that yeah there's no preset position at

1150.24 --> 1159.919
the end of it so very elaborate

1155.7 --> 1159.919
explanation about that

1164.86 --> 1174.77
but yeah it's been a long process in

1168.86 --> 1177.74
total at least a year of daily pondering

1174.77 --> 1181.52
thinking reflecting trying to explain it

1177.74 --> 1183.74
getting mistakes out of the way and over

1181.52 --> 1188.03
and over and over again it's an online

1183.74 --> 1191.27
life recorded open study basically

1188.03 --> 1197.3899999999999
that's what I've been doing I learned a

1191.27 --> 1202.52
lot hmm

1197.39 --> 1205.5700000000002
also happy by the way to say that I have

1202.52 --> 1210.68
continued my quantum mechanics study

1205.57 --> 1214.58
finally the calling came back so I went

1210.68 --> 1216.3500000000001
back into the Feynman lectures still

1214.58 --> 1218.87
with somewhat of a disappointment

1216.35 --> 1224.09
regarding all this the Einsteinian

1218.87 --> 1227.36
subjects that have spotted but still

1224.09 --> 1230.87
clicked on something and looked just

1227.36 --> 1235.78
what he had to say and it doesn't seem

1230.87 --> 1240.08
like Einsteinian ism is as rampant as

1235.78 --> 1243.67
the chapter titles would suggest so

1240.08 --> 1246.83
Einsteinian ism may be more of a cover

1243.67 --> 1248.63
to make it look more interesting because

1246.83 --> 1253.33
the things that he does describe are

1248.63 --> 1256.0100000000002
very detailed and don't feel so much

1253.33 --> 1258.9499999999998
presuppositional as what I expected to

1256.01 --> 1263.84
find there so I will continue this it's

1258.95 --> 1266.42
funny because because quantum eraser did

1263.84 --> 1268.85
kind of tell me that and I guess since

1266.42 --> 1271.67
he has looked through it all in this

1268.85 --> 1275.1399999999999
case he was probably right so I hope

1271.67 --> 1283.8700000000001
you're happy John

1275.14 --> 1286.3500000000001
what yeah I'm continuing this and we'll

1283.87 --> 1286.35
see where it goes

1310.53 --> 1318.59
all right well Neil W you are

1314.25 --> 1322.04
technically slightly incorrect because

1318.59 --> 1326.01
it is really about the ratio of one

1322.04 --> 1329.1599999999999
density towards another and one of the

1326.01 --> 1331.74
most reliable density is pure water so

1329.16 --> 1334.38
that's why they use it as a material

1331.74 --> 1340.59
measuring stick as per default but it is

1334.38 --> 1345.14
not absolutely necessary it's just the

1340.59 --> 1352.6799999999998
best measuring stick that they chose to

1345.14 --> 1355.7900000000002
to use for the foundation but you don't

1352.68 --> 1355.79
necessarily need water

1360.47 --> 1363.589
[Music]

1365.69 --> 1374.97
all right yeah there seems to be

1371.36 --> 1379.01
shootings going on by the way again saw

1374.97 --> 1381.659
something or yeah all the my typicals

1379.01 --> 1383.94
new sources like Russia today and

1381.659 --> 1388.47
Infowars were all about Oh some Texas

1383.94 --> 1391.3500000000001
shooting and just a few days ago

1388.47 --> 1395.179
something else so it seems to be like

1391.35 --> 1395.1789999999999
there's a lot of [ __ ] going down and

1403.37 --> 1410.57
yeahthere's I've heard that some of them

1408.17 --> 1415.3700000000001
are just like the freakin Christ your

1410.57 --> 1417.26
shooter another insane community let's

1415.37 --> 1419.83
just call them communities because they

1417.26 --> 1423.52
are Communists and Nazis they're just

1419.83 --> 1423.52
communities they're crazy

1425.559 --> 1433.94
so yeah disturbing although I keep in

1431.87 --> 1435.86
mind and that's why I don't keep on over

1433.94 --> 1440.6000000000001
reporting on this stuff there is a

1435.86 --> 1448.34
psychological element to it and that is

1440.6 --> 1451.49
the fear spell but still despite if you

1448.34 --> 1452.3
take a step back and just think about it

1451.49 --> 1454.79
okay

1452.3 --> 1460.309
it is still just not nice that they're

1454.79 --> 1462.32
not nice it's still terrible that

1460.309 --> 1468.8899999999999
they're suddenly just is ramping up of

1462.32 --> 1471.4289999999999
this type of event don't remember having

1468.89 --> 1473.42
seen so many of these types of

1471.429 --> 1475.6100000000001
announcements about certain shoot

1473.42 --> 1478.21
suppose these shooters is such a short

1475.61 --> 1478.2099999999998
period of time

1478.78 --> 1483.95
well yeah crisis actors maybe well I'm

1481.97 --> 1488.3
not gonna say that just outright because

1483.95 --> 1492.92
I haven't even have found any clues like

1488.3 --> 1494.69
are any direct report or somebody

1492.92 --> 1497.3000000000002
reporting on and having a big quote no

1494.69 --> 1499.8500000000001
it's just this is all just preliminary

1497.3 --> 1503.87
news and I don't see any indications of

1499.85 --> 1505.82
fakery like the latest thing the Garlic

1503.87 --> 1509.6599999999999
Festival roster said he had his doubts

1505.82 --> 1512.3799999999999
about it but he wasn't specific so I

1509.66 --> 1512.38
can't say

1513.58 --> 1522.06
like oh and by the way if we're gonna

1518.2 --> 1525.64
enter that that uncomfortable subject

1522.06 --> 1529.06
then I might also give it like a very

1525.64 --> 1533.5
late update because I did some time ago

1529.06 --> 1536.6499999999999
watch that freaking video the that that

1533.5 --> 1540.31
dick had made as he was shooting up the

1536.65 --> 1545.38
mosque and everything and yeah I did it

1540.31 --> 1547.1799999999998
under a lot of alcohol in a rush just to

1545.38 --> 1550.5100000000002
have that wall in between there

1547.18 --> 1553.54
but despite I know that under alcohol I

1550.51 --> 1556.0
still see and I don't get distracted by

1553.54 --> 1558.52
my own feeling I actually get distracted

1556.0 --> 1563.98
less by my own opinions and feelings and

1558.52 --> 1565.78
when I saw it I really do have to say

1563.98 --> 1568.93
that that was absolutely real every

1565.78 --> 1571.42
detail and even weird little detail

1568.93 --> 1574.3600000000001
questions that I heard about as I saw it

1571.42 --> 1579.1000000000001
with in mind like oh that's supposed to

1574.36 --> 1581.59
happen somewhere yeah that's all a giant

1579.1 --> 1586.86
mistake no that was absolutely real so

1581.59 --> 1592.36
that is my conclusion yeah exactly and

1586.86 --> 1594.07
in a way you know it's kind of

1592.36 --> 1598.54
disappointing because I really hope that

1594.07 --> 1601.86
it was fake because it was just horrific

1598.54 --> 1609.8799999999999
it was really it felt just directly like

1601.86 --> 1612.9399999999998
total massacre like there was no yeah I

1609.88 --> 1614.8300000000002
don't even want to think too deeply back

1612.94 --> 1619.99
about it but just wanted to share I

1614.83 --> 1621.87
watched it and with great regret I have

1619.99 --> 1624.63
to share that I think that it was

1621.87 --> 1628.59
absolutely real I have no more doubts

1624.63 --> 1628.5900000000001
that that was real Oh

1633.94 --> 1637.8990000000001
what the [ __ ] dude

1639.7 --> 1651.74
Karen B how do you how do you do it you

1649.97 --> 1654.44
always get these trolls to say the

1651.74 --> 1660.049
sickest things I don't get it

1654.44 --> 1662.1200000000001
it's weird they're not blaming you

1660.049 --> 1664.039
directly but it's always like every time

1662.12 --> 1668.4799999999998
you guys you're in my chat these weirdos

1664.039 --> 1679.7
always start to go way over the top it's

1668.48 --> 1683.289
freaky anyway yeah it's right so I saw

1679.7 --> 1686.3600000000001
that you have no doubts about it and

1683.289 --> 1689.08
added yeah well I don't think I need to

1686.36 --> 1692.889
like officially apologize because I was

1689.08 --> 1695.99
kind of disclaimer disclaimer i didäôt

1692.889 --> 1698.09
despite that what was it the second or

1695.99 --> 1702.98
the first video about Christchurch was

1698.09 --> 1706.279
just removed by YouTube entirely but as

1702.98 --> 1709.76
for these new events I don't know I

1706.279 --> 1714.58
can't say anything I'm just a little bit

1709.76 --> 1717.71
nervous to see so many articles about

1714.58 --> 1719.6589999999999
different types of event it's not just

1717.71 --> 1723.46
one event that's been oh there's there

1719.659 --> 1723.46
seem to be multiple things happening and

1725.08 --> 1728.59
we'll just see

1731.49 --> 1738.08
I'll keep you guys updated if I learn

1734.09 --> 1738.08
more interesting details

1750.44 --> 1753.539
[Music]

1768.09 --> 1780.0
now now free-minded Effie look these

1776.19 --> 1786.06
people they may well yeah they may be

1780.0 --> 1789.06
white but they are they have no logos at

1786.06 --> 1790.83
our day they they're literally out to

1789.06 --> 1793.29
destroy everything including their own

1790.83 --> 1795.8
race there they are literally like

1793.29 --> 1801.6
demons conditions like demons

1795.8 --> 1804.48
so I there's no association to any race

1801.6 --> 1812.2199999999998
thank you they just try to do as much

1804.48 --> 1814.08
damage as they can because even with the

1812.22 --> 1817.23
Christ Church shooting video that was

1814.08 --> 1820.1899999999998
plenty obvious that he literally dragged

1817.23 --> 1823.79
in people that had nothing to do with it

1820.19 --> 1828.78
for pure slander and dramatic meme

1823.79 --> 1832.59
warfare because the guy it's only won

1828.78 --> 1839.09
one direction that straight down destroy

1832.59 --> 1841.4399999999998
all things by all means and yeah sorry

1839.09 --> 1847.9199999999998
that's what they would that's what they

1841.44 --> 1850.0800000000002
do apparently like yeah I guess I'll

1847.92 --> 1856.0700000000002
never really know what'll drive a person

1850.08 --> 1859.53
to go that far I don't think I would be

1856.07 --> 1861.6599999999999
physically possible yeah I would i I

1859.53 --> 1863.22
don't think that would be physically

1861.66 --> 1865.65
possible for me to do under any

1863.22 --> 1867.33
condition even if they try to

1865.65 --> 1872.46
mind-control me or something

1867.33 --> 1875.3899999999999
I don't know then again I don't exactly

1872.46 --> 1878.91
know what they underwent maybe they went

1875.39 --> 1884.3100000000002
through something as harsh as I went

1878.91 --> 1889.25
through and didn't have any how do you

1884.31 --> 1893.6699999999998
say Spirit of God that they kept like

1889.25 --> 1895.89
like a flame through the desert and they

1893.67 --> 1897.66
just went full demon because I can

1895.89 --> 1899.8500000000001
barely imagine what would have happened

1897.66 --> 1900.8300000000002
if I had done that then maybe I would

1899.85 --> 1906.019
have turned into one

1900.83 --> 1909.9189999999999
maniacs it was certainly suggested even

1906.019 --> 1912.35
like like yeah you go do that that's

1909.919 --> 1914.179
what you're supposed to do like are you

1912.35 --> 1919.039
out of your mind that was my response

1914.179 --> 1919.669
because yeah the programming hadn't

1919.039 --> 1924.44
worked

1919.669 --> 1928.3090000000002
I didn't hadn't relinquished mental

1924.44 --> 1930.3500000000001
faculties to sufficient standards for

1928.309 --> 1934.6689999999999
them to be able to mind-control me like

1930.35 --> 1940.6899999999998
that because I'm pretty sure they damn

1934.669 --> 1949.279
well tried and that's a long time ago

1940.69 --> 1952.94
currently I don't even know what they

1949.279 --> 1957.639
had planned for me for the long run what

1952.94 --> 1957.6390000000001
they expect me to do and I don't care

1965.48 --> 1968.48
yeah

1973.6 --> 1979.32
a Rasta what did you say

1992.86 --> 1997.03
yes Lord sloth of all

2001.33 --> 2017.62
I believe it and then again no I'm not

2012.34 --> 2026.34
even gonna go into that oh right I you

2017.62 --> 2026.34
Resta no problem

2036.83 --> 2039.49
huh

2047.52 --> 2052.61
a Riley are you doing

2086.57 --> 2096.77
all right yeah sure I'll call ya

2100.97 --> 2111.5789999999997
[Music]

2104.319 --> 2113.96
hello hey what's up this is gonna win

2111.579 --> 2120.799
this is gonna ring forever - anybody

2113.96 --> 2125.359
know how to stop yeah you can hover over

2120.799 --> 2127.369
it and then you have this let's see in

2125.359 --> 2129.98
the sidebar where you see the chats

2127.369 --> 2132.4300000000003
calls context notifications at the top

2129.98 --> 2136.5190000000002
you have your icon if you click on that

2132.43 --> 2139.64
you get a small drop down list and the

2136.519 --> 2144.1299999999997
first thing if you select no do not

2139.64 --> 2144.1299999999997
disturb then you'll not hear anything

2144.309 --> 2147.369
all right

2150.63 --> 2154.0190000000002
I'm just waiting for it to finish its

2152.369 --> 2156.259
cycle it takes about 30 seconds it's

2154.019 --> 2156.2589999999996
horrendous

2157.489 --> 2165.9
where you get called a lot okay

2163.64 --> 2167.489
yeah yeah I just thought it seems to be

2165.9 --> 2169.349
ringing twice it rings once that I

2167.489 --> 2170.5190000000002
answer and then it rings the smells

2169.349 --> 2171.7200000000003
ringing in the background that I don't

2170.519 --> 2173.609
know where the sounds coming from it's

2171.72 --> 2179.2389999999996
driving me mad huh anybody know how to

2173.609 --> 2183.18
fix I'm shocked I could just be a glitch

2179.239 --> 2186.839
you know keep it updated there's a lot

2183.18 --> 2188.759
of updates that's good Sandra's gonna

2186.839 --> 2190.65
feel the need to remind people in chat

2188.759 --> 2192.539
that these ballers they can't even give

2190.65 --> 2194.309
a concise and consistent definition for

2192.539 --> 2197.099
what gravity is they still refer to it

2194.309 --> 2199.559
as a force it's not a force guys it's

2197.099 --> 2201.21
not a faucet all and stop calling it as

2199.559 --> 2203.4300000000003
a force it's not that's have a

2201.21 --> 2205.559
consistent in application of your own

2203.43 --> 2207.529
definition it's the curvature the

2205.559 --> 2209.579
bending of the curvature of space-time a

2207.529 --> 2211.44
mathematical construct that's got no

2209.579 --> 2213.829
application at all in real-world

2211.44 --> 2217.65
experiment and as we know from yesterday

2213.829 --> 2223.65
rumpus strudels with the word and oh god

2217.65 --> 2226.349
yes oh that was so [ __ ] with the

2223.65 --> 2227.969
word and when we were looking up we were

2226.349 --> 2230.67
looking up the definition of the word

2227.969 --> 2233.88
science and it says it's the data data

2230.67 --> 2235.89
observation and experiment is the

2233.88 --> 2237.9300000000003
requirement for science and he was

2235.89 --> 2240.8689999999997
trying to argue that observation and

2237.93 --> 2242.549
experiment means or and he said that if

2240.869 --> 2245.2490000000003
he goes to the zoo and he sees zebras

2242.549 --> 2247.019
and lions that doesn't mean he needs to

2245.249 --> 2248.6699999999996
see both zebras and lions to be able to

2247.019 --> 2250.89
correctly say that you can see zebras

2248.67 --> 2252.779
and lions and I'm like if you go to the

2250.89 --> 2255.269
zoo and you say that you see zebras and

2252.779 --> 2257.039
lions you've seen zebras and lions you

2255.269 --> 2258.6899999999996
can't come back and say I've seen zebra

2257.039 --> 2260.5490000000004
and lions if you didn't see any Lions

2258.69 --> 2261.119
because then that scent that sentence

2260.549 --> 2262.979
would be false

2261.119 --> 2264.719
wouldn't it and in this context when

2262.979 --> 2267.1189999999997
precision in words is important and

2264.719 --> 2269.2490000000003
let's be honest this is like like year

2267.119 --> 2271.829
five stuff in school the word and

2269.249 --> 2273.93
doesn't mean all it means and so it

2271.829 --> 2276.299
includes the other so one includes the

2273.93 --> 2278.999
other you got both and there's a very

2276.299 --> 2281.279
desperate semantic machination that

2278.999 --> 2282.8089999999997
they're trying at at this point they

2281.279 --> 2283.599
have to do it because they know that all

2282.809 --> 2285.6090000000004
of the nonce

2283.599 --> 2287.799
the science that they all preach and put

2285.609 --> 2289.5389999999998
and claim that they apply they know that

2287.799 --> 2290.859
there's no application with experiments

2289.539 --> 2292.329
and they have to do mattli have to

2290.859 --> 2294.759
obfuscate that point to make it sound

2292.329 --> 2297.19
like it includes and it doesn't it's

2294.759 --> 2299.619
both of them together right one and the

2297.19 --> 2300.91
other it's not one or the other and he's

2299.619 --> 2302.799
trying to make it sound as though it's

2300.91 --> 2304.749
inclusive for him for the first science

2302.799 --> 2307.47
to have observations without experiments

2304.749 --> 2310.2389999999996
as though it seemed in the word and is

2307.47 --> 2313.029
incorporating it and it clearly isn't so

2310.239 --> 2314.92
let's remember that these these idiots

2313.029 --> 2317.38
on their side if they're claiming

2314.92 --> 2319.2690000000002
science its observation and experiment

2317.38 --> 2320.92
it's not observation or experiment

2319.269 --> 2324.3089999999997
because that's the definition of

2320.92 --> 2326.049
pseudoscience indeed yeah everybody

2324.309 --> 2328.299
everybody gets this oh I mean I thought

2326.049 --> 2329.41
literally about well I'm not gonna name

2328.299 --> 2331.63
names but about people that have

2329.41 --> 2334.6299999999997
contacted me afterwards and said surely

2331.63 --> 2337.63
he gets this how deist only remains so

2334.63 --> 2340.089
calm and I realized that it's not I'm

2337.63 --> 2341.619
not dealing with bumpass anymore six

2340.089 --> 2343.15
months ago it was personal against

2341.619 --> 2345.46
rumpus cuz I'm D I wanted to beat

2343.15 --> 2347.589
bumpers but now I realize all you've got

2345.46 --> 2349.359
to ask the rumpus is its gravity of

2347.589 --> 2351.91
force and the minute he starts off with

2349.359 --> 2353.5589999999997
his 3d 4d explanation it still isn't a

2351.91 --> 2355.479
force even if you think of it as a force

2353.559 --> 2356.739
it's not a force and it can't cause

2355.479 --> 2358.21
anything it's the effect of the

2356.739 --> 2360.579
curvature of space-time according to

2358.21 --> 2362.68
Einstein or a mathematical construct but

2360.579 --> 2364.299
you get him in riddles uni I mean I

2362.68 --> 2366.3089999999997
asked him about gravimeters did he prove

2364.299 --> 2367.779
gravity and he said yes two minutes

2366.309 --> 2369.9100000000003
after saying that science can't prove

2367.779 --> 2371.499
anything so the minute you contradict

2369.91 --> 2372.549
yourself by saying science doesn't prove

2371.499 --> 2375.3089999999997
anything and then Clayton the

2372.549 --> 2378.819
gravimeters proved gravity right dad the

2375.309 --> 2381.279
whole story I like this whole they even

2378.819 --> 2384.249
brought it as far as like they had to be

2381.279 --> 2388.359
very careful in order not to disturb the

2384.249 --> 2390.9689999999996
detection of the gravity wave like this

2388.359 --> 2394.15
alias science fiction story I ever heard

2390.969 --> 2396.369
of course is his main his main argument

2394.15 --> 2398.6800000000003
for science not proving anything is that

2396.369 --> 2400.6600000000003
you can't ever disprove the possibility

2398.68 --> 2403.029
that invisible green Pixies might have

2400.66 --> 2405.67
been [ __ ] with you and the reality is

2403.029 --> 2407.529
that is an argument ad absurdum

2405.67 --> 2409.029
he's reducing the argument down to the

2407.529 --> 2411.999
absurd to try and make it sound

2409.029 --> 2413.529
plausible well we all know that if the

2411.999 --> 2414.999
wearer invisible green Pixies doing it

2413.529 --> 2416.89
then you couldn't ever prove anything

2414.999 --> 2417.069
and that's not what science is now if

2416.89 --> 2419.2889999999998
you

2417.069 --> 2421.419
believe it's relevant it's not relevant

2419.289 --> 2423.3390000000004
because science is about the physical

2421.419 --> 2425.799
natural world so even if there was

2423.339 --> 2429.16
anything that we could not detect it's

2425.799 --> 2430.39
not relevant until we could that's how

2429.16 --> 2433.569
science really works

2430.39 --> 2436.15
it just rests on the experiment like

2433.569 --> 2438.489
yeah it works this way because if you

2436.15 --> 2442.15
repeat it it does the same thing and now

2438.489 --> 2445.029
however then the structure is thought up

2442.15 --> 2447.2490000000003
what what causes it and how it's tied in

2445.029 --> 2450.819
to everything that's a separate matter

2447.249 --> 2452.6189999999997
but the experiment is just an experiment

2450.819 --> 2458.079
and it is repeatable and that is what it

2452.619 --> 2461.049
does that doesn't change right yeah did

2458.079 --> 2462.849
you notice that when words are important

2461.049 --> 2465.309
for their interpretation to have any

2462.849 --> 2467.589
credibility whatsoever it's never a

2465.309 --> 2469.449
semantic argument when that happens it's

2467.589 --> 2471.699
only ever a semantic argument when we

2469.449 --> 2473.319
say hang on a sec the word and doesn't

2471.699 --> 2475.239
mean all and then they just say stop

2473.319 --> 2477.669
being semantics and it's like but words

2475.239 --> 2479.7690000000002
of meaning they have you know meanings

2477.669 --> 2481.089
of words are important if you're gonna

2479.769 --> 2483.1299999999997
say that you went to the zoo and saw

2481.089 --> 2485.049
lions on Tigers you expected that to

2483.13 --> 2489.179
mean that you saw lions on Tigers not

2485.049 --> 2491.319
just lions right right

2489.179 --> 2492.5190000000002
arguing with five-year-olds of primary

2491.319 --> 2494.439
school but that's how it's become

2492.519 --> 2496.6589999999997
because they know that they cut the car

2494.439 --> 2497.89
of their science what they claimed to be

2496.659 --> 2499.359
science they can't have that being

2497.89 --> 2503.2889999999998
deemed a pseudoscience but my definition

2499.359 --> 2506.14
it clearly is all right they well they

2503.289 --> 2510.009
have been on track for a while now to

2506.14 --> 2511.6299999999997
literally try to keep the sign tit to

2510.009 --> 2514.869
keep the feel of science and the

2511.63 --> 2517.2690000000002
scientific method out of the the real

2514.869 --> 2520.9190000000003
scientific realm and so they can have

2517.269 --> 2523.959
their giant cloud Castle to work with

2520.919 --> 2526.8689999999997
their playground presuppositions

2523.959 --> 2529.749
everywhere so they're desperate to

2526.869 --> 2532.6890000000003
basically not let it get earth

2529.749 --> 2535.39
don't let the anchor drop and hit

2532.689 --> 2540.489
something real because then it all falls

2535.39 --> 2542.8289999999997
apart yeah science is the observation

2540.489 --> 2543.88
and experimentation of the physical and

2542.829 --> 2545.8900000000003
the natural world

2543.88 --> 2548.619
what's physical and natural about

2545.89 --> 2549.1
gravity can't even define it let alone

2548.619 --> 2551.92
of

2549.1 --> 2553.72
tell it like let alone like experiment

2551.92 --> 2555.25
with it can I even get a consistent

2553.72 --> 2558.6699999999996
definition from them from what gravity

2555.25 --> 2561.79
is it's nonsense gravity is just a

2558.67 --> 2564.66
presumed force being present without any

2561.79 --> 2568.27
cause to it except for the fictional

2564.66 --> 2570.52
yeah just it really has got to the point

2568.27 --> 2572.2
now where it doesn't matter what the

2570.52 --> 2574.57
arguments back and forth for gravity are

2572.2 --> 2576.49
so long as worth arguing that gravity

2574.57 --> 2579.5800000000004
acting as or gravity's thing will

2576.49 --> 2581.8599999999997
reaffirm in that it's it will reify in

2579.58 --> 2583.75
somewhat that's conceptual there is no

2581.86 --> 2585.7000000000003
evidence for gravity you can believe if

2583.75 --> 2587.23
you want to you can treat it as real if

2585.7 --> 2589.5099999999998
you want to but it doesn't prove that

2587.23 --> 2591.1
it's a thing and that's all by talking

2589.51 --> 2593.9500000000003
about it it will use it as a measuring

2591.1 --> 2596.74
stick but that still doesn't draw it out

2593.95 --> 2597.91
of the conceptual realm it's funny

2596.74 --> 2600.37
because sometimes when I'm talking to

2597.91 --> 2603.19
these bowlers what they talk about with

2600.37 --> 2604.6
gravity differs from conversation to

2603.19 --> 2606.25
conversation because sometimes it is

2604.6 --> 2609.2799999999997
just the fact that an object falls to

2606.25 --> 2611.38
the ground rather than make it like

2609.28 --> 2614.3500000000004
adjusting for the fact that the object

2611.38 --> 2616.12
has weight mass and oh that was the

2614.35 --> 2618.94
other good thing that rambha says ronpa

2616.12 --> 2621.67
said I asked them I said rhombus it are

2618.94 --> 2623.98
scales a force meter and he says yes

2621.67 --> 2627.07
nice is great so if I stand on a set of

2623.98 --> 2628.9
scales and it measures something then we

2627.07 --> 2630.82
can see that there's a a force been

2628.9 --> 2632.6800000000003
applied to the scales correct he says

2630.82 --> 2634.54
yes and then I said so how does that

2632.68 --> 2638.89
work with gravity then and obviously

2634.54 --> 2640.96
gravity is assumed and I said so if I if

2638.89 --> 2642.49
I stand on the way that the scales then

2640.96 --> 2644.59
then gravity is pulling me down

2642.49 --> 2646.0899999999997
according to you and he says yes I said

2644.59 --> 2648.07
even though it can't pull because it's

2646.09 --> 2649.78
not force it said Li well it is an hour

2648.07 --> 2651.61
for time until about a lot of ah but

2649.78 --> 2652.9
it's a contradiction it's a direct

2651.61 --> 2655.36
contradiction because on the one hand he

2652.9 --> 2656.08
says that weights scales are a weight oh

2655.36 --> 2659.23
sorry

2656.08 --> 2661.12
scales are a force meter and then when

2659.23 --> 2663.22
you stand on them and it exerts a force

2661.12 --> 2665.77
and where the interaction he claims that

2663.22 --> 2667.8399999999997
its gravity doing it rather than except

2665.77 --> 2669.13
in the obvious mnestheus a human stood

2667.84 --> 2671.65
on it that weighs something he has

2669.13 --> 2673.69
weight he has mass so rather than except

2671.65 --> 2676.6600000000003
that the human has mass he calls that

2673.69 --> 2678.04
gravity but the problem is if there's an

2676.66 --> 2680.14
interaction with the scales with the

2678.04 --> 2682.84
human on it that there is a force there

2680.14 --> 2685.0
but you can't manipulate the gravity bit

2682.84 --> 2687.4300000000003
so either the scales are a force meter

2685.0 --> 2689.35
and also yes or the contradiction is

2687.43 --> 2692.77
that when the human stands on it and the

2689.35 --> 2695.7999999999997
human has got mass if the scales are a

2692.77 --> 2698.74
force meter and the humans got mass that

2695.8 --> 2701.71
makes mass a force but he won't accept

2698.74 --> 2703.39
that but he has to accept that gravity

2701.71 --> 2705.85
is not a force so I can't cause anything

2703.39 --> 2709.14
yeah so either scales or a force meter

2705.85 --> 2711.64
therefore weight mass is a force or

2709.14 --> 2713.52
scales are not a force meter he can't

2711.64 --> 2716.3799999999997
have it both ways

2713.52 --> 2718.75
and you can always of course explain it

2716.38 --> 2720.2200000000003
through a relative density because if

2718.75 --> 2722.14
you're gonna stand on the scale I'm

2720.22 --> 2725.8599999999997
pretty sure you're gonna do it in a room

2722.14 --> 2727.93
filled with air and so you are going to

2725.86 --> 2732.82
be at this equilibrium within that room

2727.93 --> 2735.73
until you go through the floor or

2732.82 --> 2738.79
whatever so until you get to that

2735.73 --> 2742.66
equilibrium point your entire body is

2738.79 --> 2746.05
gonna because it is in this equilibrium

2742.66 --> 2747.7
and no longer able to maneuver towards

2746.05 --> 2750.13
the equilibrium direction it's gonna

2747.7 --> 2751.96
express itself in that pressure force

2750.13 --> 2754.51
correct that the scale registered

2751.96 --> 2756.55
correct you're absolutely right your own

2754.51 --> 2758.4100000000003
weight your own mass is out of

2756.55 --> 2760.9900000000002
equilibrium and what the scales are

2758.41 --> 2762.94
actually measuring is a scaler as an

2760.99 --> 2764.83
arbitrary value for how far away from

2762.94 --> 2767.7400000000002
your own point of equilibrium you are

2764.83 --> 2769.69
and we can demonstrate that by putting

2767.74 --> 2771.25
them same so gasket set of scales in the

2769.69 --> 2772.48
bottom of a swimming pool and then

2771.25 --> 2773.95
trying to get you to put your weight on

2772.48 --> 2775.57
it and obviously you'll push yourself up

2773.95 --> 2776.77
it'll virtually show nothing because

2775.57 --> 2778.48
you've been to the bottom of this room

2776.77 --> 2780.46
until the Econoline on your tiptoes is

2778.48 --> 2782.41
very little weight on you but that's

2780.46 --> 2784.39
demonstrating relative density and how

2782.41 --> 2786.64
far you're a lot closer to your point of

2784.39 --> 2788.83
equilibrium and what the what the force

2786.64 --> 2790.72
meters are actually measuring the scales

2788.83 --> 2792.43
they're actually measuring how far away

2790.72 --> 2794.08
from your own point of equilibrium you

2792.43 --> 2796.45
are relative to the medium that you're

2794.08 --> 2799.12
in at the time you're right Arwen well I

2796.45 --> 2803.1099999999997
wouldn't say the distance of the

2799.12 --> 2808.21
equilibria is just how far apart the

2803.11 --> 2810.31
object weighed is a way yeah sorry I'm

2808.21 --> 2813.1
not explaining it well but just how big

2810.31 --> 2815.569
the difference between relative density

2813.1 --> 2818.239
is the severity of the difference

2815.569 --> 2821.69
because they're worse the difference the

2818.239 --> 2823.67
more subjective all to this these yeah

2821.69 --> 2827.089
the displacement force it becomes or

2823.67 --> 2829.549
pressure I think what we should rewind

2827.089 --> 2831.44
these ballers is that wait is medium

2829.549 --> 2833.809
specific because depending on what

2831.44 --> 2835.91
medium you're in governs the the weight

2833.809 --> 2838.309
that these force meters are indicated

2835.91 --> 2841.459
because it is medium specific right and

2838.309 --> 2844.699
we get so used to just that we use

2841.459 --> 2848.209
skills in a room with air so it's just

2844.699 --> 2850.88
taken for granted not realized that it

2848.209 --> 2853.93
is very relevant what the medium is the

2850.88 --> 2856.19
object is sitting in for the registry

2853.93 --> 2857.8089999999997
and if you think about one of their

2856.19 --> 2859.4
other claims which is that as you climb

2857.809 --> 2860.809
a mountain you gain weight because

2859.4 --> 2862.94
you're getting further away from the

2860.809 --> 2864.469
gravitational pull of the earth well

2862.94 --> 2865.9990000000003
you're also changing the medium that

2864.469 --> 2867.68
you're in you're reducing the density of

2865.999 --> 2869.569
the medium that you're in so you're

2867.68 --> 2870.979
gonna become relative to the medium that

2869.569 --> 2872.269
you were in previously you're gonna be a

2870.979 --> 2874.489
little bit more heavy because the

2872.269 --> 2875.6899999999996
mediums changed and you've not changed

2874.489 --> 2877.339
your weights you might have sweated a

2875.69 --> 2879.9790000000003
little bit to get there but really your

2877.339 --> 2881.18
well your weights been constant but what

2879.979 --> 2882.859
they will say is while you're further

2881.18 --> 2884.0589999999997
away from the center of the earth or we

2882.859 --> 2885.65
can also say yeah but you've also

2884.059 --> 2886.6090000000004
changed the dempster density of the

2885.65 --> 2888.4990000000003
medium that you're in and you just

2886.609 --> 2892.66
demonstrated a relative density

2888.499 --> 2895.0989999999997
variation that's all you've done indeed

2892.66 --> 2896.66
it's like it's a language all by itself

2895.099 --> 2898.309
isn't it this now we're understanding

2896.66 --> 2899.779
that there is phraseology that it's

2898.309 --> 2901.9990000000003
necessary that we're having to learn

2899.779 --> 2903.739
these phrases and what they mean and the

2901.999 --> 2906.019
ball is don't understand it at all and

2903.739 --> 2907.549
just dismiss it with ridicule book the

2906.019 --> 2909.319
reality is we're we can't demonstrate

2907.549 --> 2913.699
these things do cause what we see

2909.319 --> 2916.16
changes indeed we can it did a relative

2913.699 --> 2920.2090000000003
density Theory if approached properly if

2916.16 --> 2927.5589999999997
fails in a lot fills in much where

2920.209 --> 2930.859
gravity originally went so yeah relative

2927.559 --> 2935.599
density it really explains it it really

2930.859 --> 2937.249
does but it also complies a scientific

2935.599 --> 2939.4100000000003
method because we can give it that

2937.249 --> 2941.839
independent variable that presumed cause

2939.41 --> 2943.3089999999997
a wiggle and what do you know when we

2941.839 --> 2945.319
wiggle it it causes some air

2943.309 --> 2947.299
and then they just dismiss it and say

2945.319 --> 2949.07
knows gravity well it's not what we

2947.299 --> 2951.02
wiggle visit and scientific methods

2949.07 --> 2953.09
is that the thing that we wiggle is the

2951.02 --> 2954.38
cause the presumed cause and then when

2953.09 --> 2956.8700000000003
you wiggle it you establish the cause

2954.38 --> 2958.19
and effect relationship well that's no

2956.87 --> 2959.66
good if you're gonna argue gravity

2958.19 --> 2961.2200000000003
because gravity wasn't they presumed

2959.66 --> 2962.69
cause and if it is the presumed cause

2961.22 --> 2966.16
you didn't wiggle it so you haven't

2962.69 --> 2968.69
demonstrated it indycar infer cause

2966.16 --> 2971.42
indeed and you can't also secretly

2968.69 --> 2974.9900000000002
inject it into a complex hypotheses

2971.42 --> 2979.64
assuming that it's proven like the

2974.99 --> 2981.41
ballers love to do with gravity oh good

2979.64 --> 2983.15
know what's going on with Nathan I don't

2981.41 --> 2985.1299999999997
see him live for a few days indeed I

2983.15 --> 2987.32
don't know I don't know what's going on

2985.13 --> 2989.83
I expected that ball busters yesterday

2987.32 --> 2992.0
evening but no nothing

2989.83 --> 2993.77
I've not even heard from people I'm not

2992.0 --> 2997.72
anything I've messed up maybe he's

2993.77 --> 2997.72
become a baller right

2997.81 --> 3007.15
wouldn't that be something apparently

3003.67 --> 3009.9300000000003
something's burning give me two SEC's

3007.15 --> 3009.9300000000003
I'll be back all right

3012.38 --> 3017.52
[Music]

3020.74 --> 3025.9599999999996
yeah it was a nice chat with Riley

3037.39 --> 3044.469
[Applause]

3039.75 --> 3044.469
[Music]

3051.78 --> 3062.8500000000004
huh okay I see Jose is going live in

3060.08 --> 3065.69
less than half an hour

3062.85 --> 3065.69
interesting

3077.64 --> 3091.8799999999997
hello proficient pirates to see you and

3081.329 --> 3099.559
also Daniel Levy a and regular Daniel

3091.88 --> 3104.46
more colored I'm clearly Jason Cormac

3099.559 --> 3106.4700000000003
Billy was a yeah I've gotten to the rest

3104.46 --> 3108.7690000000002
of you before this Oh Alexander light

3106.47 --> 3108.769
water

3119.54 --> 3122.17
Hey

3122.73 --> 3127.359
nothing was burning it was the rhubarb

3124.96 --> 3129.19
crumble in the oven it was cooked oh so

3127.359 --> 3132.21
we're just getting the crispness of the

3129.19 --> 3136.93
here crumble on top get in my belly

3132.21 --> 3141.9
okay yeah I'm gonna get some lunch

3136.93 --> 3144.18
I think in maybe 10 minutes or so I

3141.9 --> 3146.619
heard you saying that Jose's going live

3144.18 --> 3147.91
yeah you know what I will go get your

3146.619 --> 3149.349
lunch right and what we'll do is we'll

3147.91 --> 3150.73
go in there and we'll just hijack his

3149.349 --> 3152.319
hangout and we'll just bully them all

3150.73 --> 3154.21
into admitting that the cab the guy even

3152.319 --> 3155.23
defying gravity let alone demonstrates

3154.21 --> 3159.369
it and we'll just laugh at them for

3155.23 --> 3162.339
practicing pseudoscience hmm especially

3159.369 --> 3164.109
the rumpus ah but you know what yeah but

3162.339 --> 3165.999
when you do that rumpus is just gonna

3164.109 --> 3169.089
get really anxious and then literally

3165.999 --> 3170.7099999999996
your rumpus over everything I know but

3169.089 --> 3172.45
that's that's good for us though because

3170.71 --> 3174.369
it just demonstrates how bad rhombuses

3172.45 --> 3175.749
and literally he's not doing it because

3174.369 --> 3177.369
he's an [ __ ] he's doing it cuz he

3175.749 --> 3179.7099999999996
knows he has to because he can't

3177.369 --> 3181.9
possibly Ava's defaming his own sciences

3179.71 --> 3188.23
pseudoscience you know guess what buddy

3181.9 --> 3190.329
is I don't know it at this point you

3188.23 --> 3192.809
know with rumpus it I almost feel bad

3190.329 --> 3196.329
when we do that because it's almost like

3192.809 --> 3198.94
just poking the mentally [ __ ] person

3196.329 --> 3201.2200000000003
you know he can't help it it's really

3198.94 --> 3203.38
sad you're right you kind of help you I

3201.22 --> 3205.839
agree you can't help it we're always

3203.38 --> 3209.17
smart she just doesn't have control over

3205.839 --> 3211.72
his room pissing just doesn't soon as he

3209.17 --> 3219.609
gets the jitters it just rattles out of

3211.72 --> 3219.91
control but yeah I'll take you up on

3219.609 --> 3225.609
that

3219.91 --> 3227.6189999999997
maybe I'll oh yeah I will get some lunch

3225.609 --> 3230.529
but I'll do that after I end the show

3227.619 --> 3234.13
not during the show and then after I'll

3230.529 --> 3235.72
join up with you cool all right

3234.13 --> 3237.2490000000003
I'll drop in there you can round up if

3235.72 --> 3238.779
you want or whatever in LA I'll probably

3237.249 --> 3240.97
catch you in Jose's for a bit more go on

3238.779 --> 3243.88
beliefs and borders but science and

3240.97 --> 3245.89
scientific right indeed okay hey thanks

3243.88 --> 3251.079
for joining and yeah enjoy yeah enjoy

3245.89 --> 3253.259
your lunch rhubarb crumble latest see

3251.079 --> 3253.259
you later

3254.96 --> 3264.21
yeah that was good put my volume back to

3263.34 --> 3273.6800000000003
normal

3264.21 --> 3276.15
oh dear does it every time

3273.68 --> 3281.64
alright so it's back to normal volume

3276.15 --> 3284.79
again every time something every time I

3281.64 --> 3287.85
get a guest to join through Skype OBS

3284.79 --> 3294.3
just starts to auto rearrange my sound

3287.85 --> 3297.0299999999997
it is really confusing anyway yeah it

3294.3 --> 3300.4500000000003
was a nice Sunday show with Riley time

3297.03 --> 3305.5800000000004
having a bit of a chat about gravity was

3300.45 --> 3307.8599999999997
good to go through that and yeah thanks

3305.58 --> 3310.14
everyone for coming I hope you enjoyed

3307.86 --> 3312.6800000000003
the show as much as I did if you did

3310.14 --> 3316.68
then please don't forget to upload it

3312.68 --> 3318.33
YouTube and if you haven't already

3316.68 --> 3319.9199999999996
subscribed to my channel and hit the

3318.33 --> 3321.63
bell notification so you know when I'm

3319.92 --> 3325.38
going to live which is normally 2 p.m.

3321.63 --> 3327.48
Amsterdam time everyday and also please

3325.38 --> 3329.76
do support my channel through the Super

3327.48 --> 3332.72
chats PayPal and patreon and my GoFundMe

3329.76 --> 3336.9300000000003
and thank you everyone who supported me

3332.72 --> 3339.93
through the PayPal last evening

3336.93 --> 3342.4199999999996
very much appreciated very helpful I

3339.93 --> 3346.8599999999997
will be back tomorrow with flat earth

3342.42 --> 3352.02
early-bird number 265 and I'm yeah I'm

3346.86 --> 3354.4500000000003
gonna join Riley on Jose's after this I

3352.02 --> 3358.74
think and I'm gonna get some lunch

3354.45 --> 3362.95
so until the next video hashtag meifa

3358.74 --> 3393.02
indeed and keep it flat

3362.95 --> 3393.02
