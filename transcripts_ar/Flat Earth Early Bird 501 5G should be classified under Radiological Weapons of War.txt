82.43 --> 90.84
and seems like they've continued working

88.02 --> 95.1
on the road over there putting on the

90.84 --> 97.5
second layer of asphalt because yeah it

95.1 --> 101.17999999999999
is pretty dry and that's why they

97.5 --> 104.13
cancelled it apparently the second layer

101.18 --> 108.11000000000001
there's no month ago so they yeah

104.13 --> 112.71
they're putting that on pretty quickly

108.11 --> 118.47
and yeah there are some chemtrails

112.71 --> 121.22
and 43 yeah I literally saw this one

118.47 --> 121.22
being sprayed

121.72 --> 124.78
[Music]

125.64 --> 131.88
yeah so that is going on and you can

129.72 --> 134.73
also see in the distance like yeah the

131.88 --> 137.7
grayish soup over there so there is

134.73 --> 141.95
being chemtrail today but even despite

137.7 --> 145.89
that it's just very warm it's not windy

141.95 --> 148.23
well if it stays in that with you that

145.89 --> 150.72
means that that [ __ ] is gonna come down

148.23 --> 155.04
my head in this evening don't really

150.72 --> 157.2
like that idea but yeah that's quite

155.04 --> 160.4
beautiful also the tree over there the

157.2 --> 167.94
pink one is finally starting to bloom

160.4 --> 170.07
you can see that it's not fully blooming

167.94 --> 171.81
yet but it's starting to come probably

170.07 --> 176.57
in two days it's going to be full

171.81 --> 176.57

306.16 --> 312.27000000000004
oh yeah don't worry about the tell

314.55 --> 319.3
people or if it's just an automated

317.05 --> 321.37
system that just counts whatever's being

319.3 --> 325.33
folded and then adds a standard amount

321.37 --> 327.04
on top of down votes to make that always

325.33 --> 330.15999999999997
higher I don't know what it is exactly

327.04 --> 332.38

345.31 --> 350.94
hardcore

it was very geo shifter also

355.529 --> 362.30899999999997
it's like if you want a good summary

358.459 --> 364.669
video that it is it he made a very good

362.309 --> 364.66900000000004
one

372.629 --> 382.78900000000004
David icon London real taken down I am -

378.539 --> 382.789
what are you talking about

391.63 --> 396.37
what are you talking about Gideon sick

398.47 --> 405.82000000000005
thanks for the Rogen's up by the way 16

401.96 --> 405.82
quite a lot for us just starting out

410.23 --> 416.32
big interview okay so david icke had a

413.5 --> 418.23
interview on his channel and it was

416.32 --> 420.25
taken down is that what you're saying

418.23 --> 427.53000000000003
you've got to be a little bit more

420.25 --> 427.53
specific then okay all right

433.26 --> 435.98
Thanks

440.45 --> 449.09
how am i today I don't know I'm I have a

446.99 --> 455.3
lot of energy but I'm also kind of

449.09 --> 460.21999999999997
pissed off well I don't know man it was

455.3 --> 462.92
yesterday was quite confrontational

460.22 --> 466.64000000000004
maybe not so yeah I don't know to the

462.92 --> 469.46000000000004
world or to myself it's just that I

466.64 --> 476.69
started to realize how long this [ __ ]

469.46 --> 478.82
has been going really and yeah I should

476.69 --> 482.45
definitely call my healer I kind of

478.82 --> 485.75
wanted to but I'll do it somewhere after

482.45 --> 491.96
the show I think because I just feel

485.75 --> 493.82
pissed off and it's I don't even know if

491.96 --> 495.59
it's that bad in the Netherlands you

493.82 --> 498.68
know it's like I have I'm looking around

495.59 --> 504.40999999999997
and I don't see any kind of signs of 5g

498.68 --> 506.42
equipment I don't see any spots where

504.41 --> 508.55
there's a suspicious device and like

506.42 --> 511.07
dead trees in the vicinity or anything

508.55 --> 515.63
but I don't know that's might just be

511.07 --> 517.76
here that might just be this region so

515.63 --> 520.31
it's almost like I don't have anything

517.76 --> 523.34
to be pissed off directly at physically

520.31 --> 524.4499999999999
but yeah when I look at things going

523.34 --> 529.6700000000001
down in England

524.45 --> 534.47
and in Australia and getting weird in

529.67 --> 537.0999999999999
the US it just it does to me in a way I

534.47 --> 543.65
feel like yeah if that is anyway it's

537.1 --> 547.91
all mine my country my my culture the

543.65 --> 550.5799999999999
Western world and I'm just so pissed off

547.91 --> 555.56
that this is going and how people are

550.58 --> 559.6
responding to it and even conspiracy

555.56 --> 563.51
thinkers like how they are so easily

559.6 --> 569.63
stuck in railroads of thinking and

563.51 --> 572.66
behavior in just like the this the scene

569.63 --> 577.18
from Life of Brian remember we

572.66 --> 580.49
the what is it the the Jewish politician

577.18 --> 583.069
groups that are the yeah the the rebel

580.49 --> 586.4300000000001
supposed to drebbel underground type

583.069 --> 588.949
figures that as soon as they needed to

586.43 --> 593.079
spring into action they just went on an

588.949 --> 597.3499999999999
emergency gathering to to figure out

593.079 --> 598.069
like yeah things on paper complete waste

597.35 --> 601.279
of time

598.069 --> 603.56
and even conspiracy theorists nowadays

601.279 --> 606.17
because there is quite a lot of them

603.56 --> 608.2399999999999
they have this tendency as well and that

606.17 --> 613.91
kind of pisses me off it just pisses me

608.24 --> 617.319
off to realize that in every type of

613.91 --> 620.209
people there is just so little left

617.319 --> 624.17
that'll just have that natural

620.209 --> 626.329
maneuvering room with how they are to

624.17 --> 628.37
really spring into some kind of physical

626.329 --> 630.529
action and in a way that even includes

628.37 --> 633.92
myself although I think like as soon as

630.529 --> 636.259
I just see something happening I'll just

633.92 --> 639.2299999999999
be drawn to that because I do have the

636.259 --> 644.2090000000001
energy I just problem is I don't have a

639.23 --> 645.9490000000001
lot of social momentum people with

644.209 --> 647.93
people surrounding me like I am very

645.949 --> 650.3
consistent I am very the same people

647.93 --> 653.2399999999999
like know who I am in a way they know

650.3 --> 655.9699999999999
that I'm kind of odd and the ones that

653.24 --> 658.49
soakin with me know that I am smart but

655.97 --> 663.529
that's about it so in a way I got some

658.49 --> 666.74
good credit maybe two opposed for my my

663.529 --> 670.87
behavior somewhat but I don't have like

666.74 --> 676.149
this I don't have like a leadership

670.87 --> 679.1
function role as part of my social life

676.149 --> 681.5
so the only thing I can really do is

679.1 --> 683.9300000000001
just point things out and give advice

681.5 --> 688.43
and it's very frustrating for me at

683.93 --> 691.819
times because it's like people have all

688.43 --> 693.7099999999999
become so selective in what they listen

691.819 --> 698.8399999999999
to

693.71 --> 701.12
and because despite all that the

698.84 --> 703.0400000000001
pressure in their own life has built up

701.12 --> 706.01
because of just every choice they've

703.04 --> 709.36
made and what they went with that

706.01 --> 712.31
despite being able to compartmentalize

709.36 --> 715.25
themselves against like weaponized

712.31 --> 718.88
nonsense stories they tend to just not

715.25 --> 722.38
get into complicated things at all even

718.88 --> 726.01
if they are true and even backed by

722.38 --> 729.14
evidence that is of much higher

726.01 --> 731.18
reliability than for example what the

729.14 --> 734.03
typical mainstream New Starts to throw

731.18 --> 736.7299999999999
at you it just doesn't matter to most

734.03 --> 740.75
anymore because they just could never

736.73 --> 743.48
really handle anything anyway I don't

740.75 --> 747.74
know that sounds so pessimistic I'm

743.48 --> 751.46
sorry I'm so sorry I don't mean it I'm

747.74 --> 757.66
just really frustrated now because it

751.46 --> 757.6600000000001
feels like there's so much happening

760.01 --> 768.08
and I don't know I I don't even know if

765.02 --> 770.18
if people if they don't suppose idli

768.08 --> 772.85
rise up if they could even really stop

770.18 --> 777.29
it anymore or if things may just become

772.85 --> 786.41
more complicated it feels like I don't

777.29 --> 788.5999999999999
know I don't know it's at the same time

786.41 --> 791.93
I get a lot of messages from other sites

788.6 --> 794.9
like no no no you got to trust the logos

791.93 --> 797.78
you gotta trust that things will clamp

794.9 --> 801.91
down on those that deserve it I don't

797.78 --> 805.01
know it sounds kind of naive to me

801.91 --> 807.53
really although I really want to trust

805.01 --> 815.41
that in a way it's like does it really

807.53 --> 821.93
work that way in this situation you know

815.41 --> 826.61
when all these acts are done or do we

821.93 --> 829.25
just need to need to really let

826.61 --> 832.73
ourselves get hurt and not just blah

829.25 --> 836.99
blah blah hurt but like in a way that it

832.73 --> 841.82
cannot be denied to really go at it like

836.99 --> 849.29
hey government media you can't really

841.82 --> 854.0
ignore our will anymore you're not gonna

849.29 --> 857.6899999999999
turn us into literal slaves like

854.0 --> 860.89
breaking the social contract you know we

857.69 --> 865.37
had a deal government media the people

860.89 --> 869.18
you give us what we need and we

865.37 --> 874.7
basically make sure you yeah you make

869.18 --> 875.9599999999999
money and all that and yeah that's how

874.7 --> 878.7800000000001
it's supposed to work well it's not

875.96 --> 881.8100000000001
working like that seems it's only

878.78 --> 886.28
selectively you get money and the rest

881.81 --> 888.38
is just put in front of a gyro attic

886.28 --> 889.01
train and they're they have nowhere left

888.38 --> 891.62
to go

889.01 --> 894.64
that's not what government is supposed

891.62 --> 894.64
to be for

896.899 --> 904.889
this is just terrible it's it's neo

901.41 --> 908.55
feudalism and it's crapped up gradually

904.889 --> 911.16
slowly with like short bursts and then

908.55 --> 912.6899999999999
it stops again and gives headway again

911.16 --> 914.819
to the people and they're like oh thank

912.69 --> 919.0500000000001
god that's over then they do it again

914.819 --> 921.87
and people are like not again I think

919.05 --> 924.149
then they increase the rhythm and keep

921.87 --> 926.79
on doing it again and again and people

924.149 --> 928.5
are like okay we get it now but when

926.79 --> 933.36
it's dissonance is gonna stop and then

928.5 --> 937.25
it never stops and then a lot of people

933.36 --> 940.649
like yeah go nuts over that another

937.25 --> 943.589
demoralization and then people do the

940.649 --> 945.63
normies will try to forget it exists

943.589 --> 949.259
because it's like a spiritual advantage

945.63 --> 952.259
for them so they don't have to realize

949.259 --> 956.009
that something is killing them and then

952.259 --> 958.41
the government puts on the next step

956.009 --> 961.5
does that a little push and then

958.41 --> 964.199
everybody what is this and then

961.5 --> 969.839
eventually it stops and then they do it

964.199 --> 972.779
again and then do it again and then

969.839 --> 974.49
again and then again and then again and

972.779 --> 978.8389999999999
then again and then suddenly that's the

974.49 --> 983.36
new normal this is happening people this

978.839 --> 983.36
is what they do they don't stop

988.48 --> 991.1700000000001
like

994.43 --> 1002.2299999999999
it's this is not even about control

998.839 --> 1008.5600000000001
anymore about security or something no

1002.23 --> 1010.3000000000001
this is about controllers definitely run

1008.56 --> 1012.9699999999999
by Psychopaths there's no doubt about

1010.3 --> 1014.1899999999999
this because of the implications because

1012.97 --> 1018.25
of the mechanism

1014.19 --> 1021.6700000000001
they're there to end spiritual humanity

1018.25 --> 1025.66
they're there to end it to literally

1021.67 --> 1028.329
make us into drones by spiritually

1025.66 --> 1031.179
torturing everyone into drones by

1028.329 --> 1035.709
literally driving the spirit from them

1031.179 --> 1040.14
and that is what they do and they're

1035.709 --> 1040.14
becoming very efficient at it

1046.819 --> 1054.029
please get in a sec come on

1050.059 --> 1059.69
gotta be kidding me we can't stop this

1054.029 --> 1059.69
well if we can't then we will die

1067.97 --> 1079.13
and at this point you know I guess I was

1072.86 --> 1083.6299999999999
always afraid of that but trust me when

1079.13 --> 1085.99
I say there is no life on the other side

1083.63 --> 1085.99
of this

1092.97 --> 1101.34
not really it'll be a glimmer dream of

1097.2 --> 1103.71
life you know how how the globe space

1101.34 --> 1106.5
our like the endless possibility for

1103.71 --> 1108.809
human future with robots and all that in

1106.5 --> 1111.87
space how that is like a false promise

1108.809 --> 1117.1399999999999
that can keep people going in dark times

1111.87 --> 1121.5
or guess what normal humanity on earth

1117.14 --> 1123.51
will be that next dream because there

1121.5 --> 1128.039
will be none of it anymore

1123.51 --> 1131.309
it will be the dream that'll maybe keep

1128.039 --> 1134.429
some people going to somehow keep a

1131.309 --> 1139.8799999999999
remnant of their spirit but it will not

1134.429 --> 1139.88
be reality do you understand

1145.67 --> 1153.95
yeah light energy well the thing is you

1148.8 --> 1157.35
know what it feels to me like I am

1153.95 --> 1161.3700000000001
making a drama out of this it's just

1157.35 --> 1165.27
that if it isn't properly addressed and

1161.37 --> 1167.9099999999999
dealt with take a notice of it is

1165.27 --> 1172.44
literally gonna be a drama it's a drama

1167.91 --> 1174.809
on humanity and this is just like Alex

1172.44 --> 1178.0800000000002
Jones was doing like 10 years ago like a

1174.809 --> 1180.42
nutcase completely like rrragh well

1178.08 --> 1182.9399999999998
guess what the tragedy of that always

1180.42 --> 1186.059
was that he was kind of really right and

1182.94 --> 1191.67
it's just too much too much for anyone

1186.059 --> 1193.8
to handle but maybe now maybe now that

1191.67 --> 1195.96
the pressures opped on average now that

1193.8 --> 1198.75
they've gone to the next level of

1195.96 --> 1201.41
pressure laying next building block

1198.75 --> 1207.179
layers of their evil pyramid

1201.41 --> 1210.27
maybe people now could suddenly feel

1207.179 --> 1213.0590000000002
what that was about now instead of just

1210.27 --> 1216.09
seeing a raving crazy metal I got some

1213.059 --> 1219.57
nuts in the future and like he's read

1216.09 --> 1225.09
too many dystopian sci-fi books right

1219.57 --> 1228.96
and now you see oh wait yeah actually

1225.09 --> 1231.87
certain people high places powerful

1228.96 --> 1234.69
places have actually just openly gloated

1231.87 --> 1236.55
about how they thought that 90-84 was

1234.69 --> 1241.3200000000002
such a fantastic book and that they are

1236.55 --> 1247.6499999999999
definitely they want that and he hand

1241.32 --> 1253.1899999999998
copies to their friends mm-hmm so maybe

1247.65 --> 1256.2800000000002
people now are ready to start really

1253.19 --> 1260.96
figuring it out and now it's up to

1256.28 --> 1260.96
everyone to make sure that it's not just

1261.44 --> 1268.77
angry stupidity because that's just

1265.62 --> 1272.1299999999999
gonna destroy everything if it's just

1268.77 --> 1274.1399999999999
gonna be angry dumb people that doesn't

1272.13 --> 1276.5100000000002
know really what to do and just try to

1274.14 --> 1276.99
destroy [ __ ] that they think would help

1276.51 --> 1278.64
and it

1276.99 --> 1282.3
doesn't because it's completely

1278.64 --> 1284.97
disorganized and not inform not they

1282.3 --> 1287.6699999999998
don't have they only have wizards that

1284.97 --> 1290.97
will just want to make them destroy [ __ ]

1287.67 --> 1292.5
because they're evil and possessed you

1290.97 --> 1294.3
know because they are around there's a

1292.5 --> 1297.45
lot of wizards around people a lot of

1294.3 --> 1301.6499999999999
people have become wizards out of kind

1297.45 --> 1304.98
of like being spiritually killed off in

1301.65 --> 1307.5300000000002
their life and they surrender to the

1304.98 --> 1312.059
darkness and they abuse their power to

1307.53 --> 1314.61
just [ __ ] things up they do exist we've

1312.059 --> 1321.6299999999999
seen some of them basically reveal

1314.61 --> 1324.4199999999998
themselves over time but that's like in

1321.63 --> 1326.49
media it's more up front it's more

1324.42 --> 1328.98
visible more recorded weather happens

1326.49 --> 1331.05
but in real life in the normal world out

1328.98 --> 1334.59
there where people don't go online and

1331.05 --> 1340.34
constantly get filmed it also happens so

1334.59 --> 1343.559
you gotta be careful you got you gotta

1340.34 --> 1346.35
live according to principles and be very

1343.559 --> 1350.01
careful with energy recognition like in

1346.35 --> 1355.37
bad intentions and what do people really

1350.01 --> 1357.72
want to accomplish and when I say that I

1355.37 --> 1359.7299999999998
realized there's a lot of people looking

1357.72 --> 1362.0
at me and it's like what is he trying to

1359.73 --> 1366.0
accomplish you see like some kind of

1362.0 --> 1371.45
anarchist revolutionary well guess what

1366.0 --> 1376.08
I did I hate that idea I really do

1371.45 --> 1376.8600000000001
because I am kind of like I wanna obey

1376.08 --> 1381.48
the law

1376.86 --> 1383.01
it's just that government revolts

1381.48 --> 1385.559
against the law

1383.01 --> 1389.309
really no matter really what they say

1385.559 --> 1390.99
you know it's just it's social contract

1389.309 --> 1395.3999999999999
in there after certain point there's a

1390.99 --> 1399.27
breaking point and then yeah what do you

1395.4 --> 1401.8500000000001
do as a lawful willing willing lawful

1399.27 --> 1405.33
person in a country that is technically

1401.85 --> 1407.87
in spiritual chaos you know what the

1405.33 --> 1411.6589999999999
hell do you do

1407.87 --> 1415.11
it's I don't know I feel like whatever

1411.659 --> 1416.73
I'm gonna do in a big way if I do

1415.11 --> 1418.799
anything in a big way it's gonna be

1416.73 --> 1421.1100000000001
latched on to and I'm gonna be made

1418.799 --> 1424.23
somehow into a freakin fall guy I know

1421.11 --> 1426.3899999999999
it's it would happen like I've seen it

1424.23 --> 1427.8600000000001
happen even in my visions and [ __ ] they

1426.39 --> 1430.98
were almost counting on it

1427.86 --> 1434.34
they were counting on the spirit that

1430.98 --> 1443.3600000000001
would just refuse to be tamed

1434.34 --> 1446.58
to start doing that and then trap me so

1443.36 --> 1449.789
it's very tough for me to really figure

1446.58 --> 1452.399
out how to proceed how far I can go and

1449.789 --> 1454.679
I'm kind of desperately hoping there's

1452.399 --> 1461.6399999999999
just other people out there even in the

1454.679 --> 1469.799
Netherlands of this somewhat higher-ups

1461.64 --> 1475.789
I guess that are not overly politicized

1469.799 --> 1478.59
as it were that really know the dark

1475.789 --> 1482.429
implications of all the political groups

1478.59 --> 1485.07
all of them have there there's long term

1482.429 --> 1487.2
things that have dangers and that are

1485.07 --> 1490.95
aware of that and that are willing to

1487.2 --> 1492.929
kind of like try to figure out I don't

1490.95 --> 1495.39
know how to stay in the eye of the storm

1492.929 --> 1497.1000000000001
when it gets at it's worse something

1495.39 --> 1504.8700000000001
like that it would be typically Dutch

1497.1 --> 1506.399
think like that timing but yeah I'd I

1504.87 --> 1510.75
don't know

1506.399 --> 1512.58
I'm getting a bit desperate but it may

1510.75 --> 1514.669
just be temporary you know it may just

1512.58 --> 1514.6689999999999
be

1520.59 --> 1528.6999999999998
maybe it's also just seeing it's not a

1527.05 --> 1531.82
good reason to do anything about that

1528.7 --> 1535.02
okay YouTube but maybe it is also just

1531.82 --> 1537.25
seeing all these videos with these

1535.02 --> 1539.68
testimonies and seeing people getting

1537.25 --> 1542.53
really pissed off and all that for a

1539.68 --> 1548.98
good reason that is kind of getting me

1542.53 --> 1551.47
fired up yeah

1548.98 --> 1556.27
and Bill Gates is creeping me the hell

1551.47 --> 1562.6200000000001
out a lot recently it's like what is

1556.27 --> 1567.9
that man that's just the

1562.62 --> 1571.08
why I know through my year even confirm

1567.9 --> 1574.91
what that is it's just too surreal that

1571.08 --> 1574.9099999999999
that's actually happening it's just

1590.25 --> 1594.57
oh by the way thank you getting sick for

1592.559 --> 1597.96
the 5-pound super job donation very much

1594.57 --> 1598.53
appreciated are they rolling out 5g in

1597.96 --> 1603.0
Holland

1598.53 --> 1605.19
well Dean white I know there's groups

1603.0 --> 1608.13
that would like to I know they've been

1605.19 --> 1610.14
trying to I don't know how far they've

1608.13 --> 1613.5300000000002
succeeded it might be that certain type

1610.14 --> 1617.64
of city regions do have it I think I

1613.53 --> 1620.73
heard that in den hague the hague they

1617.64 --> 1626.6100000000001
had it certain places i'm not a hundred

1620.73 --> 1628.549
percent sure though i I am kind of

1626.61 --> 1632.039
confident that it's not over here

1628.549 --> 1635.549
because then you would see the signs as

1632.039 --> 1637.86
I said like dead trees like piles of

1635.549 --> 1640.2
dead or insect just laying around that

1637.86 --> 1642.6299999999999
kind of [ __ ] haven't come across it so

1640.2 --> 1646.549
far thank God

1642.63 --> 1651.71
like leave this freakin city alone

1646.549 --> 1657.59
disgusting technology crap donated

1651.71 --> 1657.5900000000001
cables all we need is cables

1661.95 --> 1664.95
anyway

1679.22 --> 1682.1200000000001
No

1686.32 --> 1693.76
remember the Alamo okay

1698.02 --> 1704.8899999999999
look at the votes minus 40 see I told

1701.29 --> 1707.11
you them really make work of it to just

1704.89 --> 1708.9
even allowed and to always have twice

1707.11 --> 1720.37
the amount of down votes

1708.9 --> 1725.5
it seems to be a thing you know I I

1720.37 --> 1729.31
cannot imagine that there's enough

1725.5 --> 1733.78
literal individuals out there that would

1729.31 --> 1741.06
all just make all that effort to go to

1733.78 --> 1743.95
my channel and do that individually like

1741.06 --> 1746.74
those standard ballers I can barely even

1743.95 --> 1750.64
imagine that they would come in here and

1746.74 --> 1752.61
hang around because most of them would

1750.64 --> 1755.5600000000002
just be looking for moments to slander

1752.61 --> 1757.1799999999998
but yeah I'm very careful with the way I

1755.56 --> 1760.59
present my things and even my

1757.18 --> 1763.0
expressions I try to cover for them and

1760.59 --> 1765.85
explain them and keep following

1763.0 --> 1770.47
principles and just do it right so it's

1765.85 --> 1776.3799999999999
like very little to fish for the yeah

1770.47 --> 1778.84
for the completed doublethink ballers so

1776.38 --> 1780.6100000000001
who is how is this even where it's not

1778.84 --> 1784.4099999999999
individuals I'm pretty sure it's not

1780.61 --> 1784.4099999999999
individuals doing the down voting here

1785.07 --> 1790.83
not all it's not 43 people

1795.55 --> 1808.0
yeah I was talking about Rogen's up and

1799.21 --> 1810.13
down I don't know why is what so I get

1808.0 --> 1812.62
distracted by that maybe because it's

1810.13 --> 1815.5300000000002
less severe than all those freaking

1812.62 --> 1817.83
other subjects and I get kind of sick of

1815.53 --> 1817.83
it too

1832.32 --> 1836.6599999999999
yeah I know right Mobius Maximus

1837.89 --> 1841.019
[Music]

1843.29 --> 1846.369
[Music]

1853.2 --> 1857.97
well I wouldn't be surprised Dean right

1866.01 --> 1875.36
how much was her Rogen again was it a

1868.65 --> 1875.3600000000001
Rogen how much was it I don't remember

1876.169 --> 1882.13
it was not a lot an inch wasn't it an

1879.809 --> 1885.259
inch or something

1882.13 --> 1885.259
[Music]

1888.02 --> 1890.8
hmm

1891.24 --> 1898.09
okay

1893.84 --> 1898.09
yeah I'm five foot seven as well

1934.58 --> 1950.0
ah four four to eleven oh that's like

1943.67 --> 1956.5600000000002
really low yeah my grandma used to be

1950.0 --> 1961.54
like total [ __ ] as well almost like

1956.56 --> 1968.4099999999999
this big I think something like this

1961.54 --> 1968.4099999999999
know how big is that not very tall

1976.14 --> 1982.5300000000002
now but she used to be bigger though she

1979.92 --> 1989.9
just shrank it's weird

1982.53 --> 1999.66
I don't know if I'm gonna shrink a lot I

1989.9 --> 2001.96
hope not then again I take very careful

1999.66 --> 2005.049
care of my back

2001.96 --> 2005.049
[Music]

2028.48 --> 2031.619
[Music]

2033.76 --> 2044.54
yeah yeah your stance is very important

2040.13 --> 2048.26
I don't know it to me look I've had back

2044.54 --> 2050.69
problems mostly just neck problems and

2048.26 --> 2055.5400000000004
it really was all because of the way I

2050.69 --> 2061.07
conducted myself and how I would

2055.54 --> 2064.13
basically try to escape by I don't know

2061.07 --> 2066.5
by tensing certain type of muscle muscle

2064.13 --> 2068.179
arrangement that would float take away

2066.5 --> 2071.81
the tension and I would just sit like

2068.179 --> 2075.4100000000003
that and kind of like escape from stress

2071.81 --> 2078.77
[ __ ] and my own mind [ __ ] and all that

2075.41 --> 2080.39
and that's very bad free that's

2078.77 --> 2082.97
literally like stressing I there's more

2080.39 --> 2087.7999999999997
people do that and it would give me some

2082.97 --> 2090.1099999999997
serious back problems sometimes but yeah

2087.8 --> 2092.6600000000003
since I figured that out that it does

2090.11 --> 2094.6400000000003
that I've gradually started to work

2092.66 --> 2098.87
against it's like it almost I have to

2094.64 --> 2100.97
like slap myself in line like no don't

2098.87 --> 2104.54
sit like that after like tell me no

2100.97 --> 2106.31
don't do that because it's like I go

2104.54 --> 2109.82
there again it's like don't do that

2106.31 --> 2110.57
don't do that bad Armand don't sit like

2109.82 --> 2113.3900000000003
that

2110.57 --> 2115.4
or like don't sit like this for an hour

2113.39 --> 2121.58
long like that [ __ ] you know it's very

2115.4 --> 2125.78
bad for my back but since I do that and

2121.58 --> 2129.47
I've also just I do more I don't know

2125.78 --> 2132.65
cat's back exercises basically like just

2129.47 --> 2137.3599999999997
get it all moving make sure my foot is

2132.65 --> 2140.7200000000003
good that it helps it to Marek I have

2137.36 --> 2143.54
tumeric you know Tamera coffee every day

2140.72 --> 2145.85
that also helps a great deal it seems

2143.54 --> 2147.98
even just a regular tumeric a little bit

2145.85 --> 2150.62
of it seems to help a great deal you

2147.98 --> 2153.58
know I don't even have too high dosage

2150.62 --> 2153.58
it and

2154.53 --> 2161.01
yeah I think because of that I'm gonna

2158.82 --> 2166.29
last very long I'm not also not gonna

2161.01 --> 2169.26
shrink as much because I managed to

2166.29 --> 2172.46
learn how to stop that over my life and

2169.26 --> 2174.3300000000004
it requires some discipline it's like

2172.46 --> 2178.79
physiological discipline you know you

2174.33 --> 2180.9
have many levels of discipline yes

2178.79 --> 2183.45
spiritual discipline and this kind of

2180.9 --> 2186.08
comes natural where it doesn't you have

2183.45 --> 2188.37
social discipline it's like in your

2186.08 --> 2191.25
interactions and the stance you take and

2188.37 --> 2195.5299999999997
how much you take people [ __ ] and all

2191.25 --> 2198.9
that for example and then there is like

2195.53 --> 2202.17
physiological discipline how well can

2198.9 --> 2205.4700000000003
you make yourself do something specific

2202.17 --> 2207.8
or exercising in a certain way keep

2205.47 --> 2210.1499999999996
pushing it like that like those are

2207.8 --> 2212.61
physiological discipline and I do have

2210.15 --> 2215.19
plenty of that I've just personally

2212.61 --> 2217.02
chosen not to go jogging every day

2215.19 --> 2219.54
because I don't like it

2217.02 --> 2222.9
makes me feel like an idiot and jogging

2219.54 --> 2223.5
is not my back doesn't like it walking

2222.9 --> 2228.62
is fine

2223.5 --> 2233.94
jogging not fine my back doesn't like it

2228.62 --> 2236.7
like unless I'm like yeah in an urge to

2233.94 --> 2238.53
do something then I tense up and then it

2236.7 --> 2241.5
works fine then no problems oh but just

2238.53 --> 2244.3500000000004
jogging like that it's bad for my back I

2241.5 --> 2248.87
don't like it I see a lot of people

2244.35 --> 2248.87
doing it these days I don't like it

2262.51 --> 2267.34
right if your core strong your posture

2265.24 --> 2271.6299999999997
should be in point yeah well that's if

2267.34 --> 2274.33
the energy is flowing richly you know if

2271.63 --> 2277.6600000000003
if the channels are open

2274.33 --> 2280.09
well you'll natural take a a good

2277.66 --> 2282.79
posture because the energy will just be

2280.09 --> 2284.619
like yeah it's like a flower but

2282.79 --> 2287.29
suddenly being able to unfold because

2284.619 --> 2291.8500000000004
the conditions are right that's really

2287.29 --> 2293.2
what it's like and if that openness is

2291.85 --> 2295.0299999999997
not there but there's still a lot of

2293.2 --> 2299.859
wrong energy then you'll typically

2295.03 --> 2304.3
stress it and try to displace that that

2299.859 --> 2306.94
stress but yeah when there is little

2304.3 --> 2310.3590000000004
obstruction it just flows that then yeah

2306.94 --> 2312.55
you'll just naturally have the tendency

2310.359 --> 2316.15
to take a right posture and to do things

2312.55 --> 2321.9700000000003
correctly because it just flows it's

2316.15 --> 2324.31
interesting how that works with me it

2321.97 --> 2327.0
matters a lot if there's good sunlight

2324.31 --> 2327.0
out there

2331.91 --> 2339.22
Wow look at that

2343.75 --> 2350.539
52 downvotes

2345.44 --> 2357.859
isn't that incredible and 27 up by the

2350.539 --> 2365.17
way thanks everyone for doing that 4G is

2357.859 --> 2365.17
your simulation what right

2375.81 --> 2386.25
well you know what twit with I've in a

2381.72 --> 2388.77
way I'd almost like to say that I want

2386.25 --> 2391.2
to take control over how the way even

2388.77 --> 2393.09
the telephone companies operate and with

2391.2 --> 2394.95
their frequencies and all that because

2393.09 --> 2398.9100000000003
there's so much of this technology and

2394.95 --> 2403.04
it's just kind of being spreader it's

2398.91 --> 2406.98
very illogical how it's all being used

2403.04 --> 2410.3
because what if you know what if you

2406.98 --> 2414.15
just have a lot of cables everywhere and

2410.3 --> 2417.57
then like every household would have a

2414.15 --> 2421.8
very reliable internet cable you know

2417.57 --> 2425.34
once you get it there it's very little

2421.8 --> 2429.1800000000003
maintenance required very little okay

2425.34 --> 2431.7000000000003
very little very little side effects so

2429.18 --> 2438.6299999999997
then you just give people the option

2431.7 --> 2441.54
okay there should be some more about

2438.63 --> 2444.21
devices still yeah people with phones

2441.54 --> 2446.61
and all that that should be around you

2444.21 --> 2449.66
know you they should have that that

2446.61 --> 2455.1600000000003
capability but just make sure that it's

2449.66 --> 2458.93
really efficient that how could you say

2455.16 --> 2461.58
this like even the idea of local

2458.93 --> 2463.89
transmissions you know like what 5g does

2461.58 --> 2467.19
now five he needs to be local because

2463.89 --> 2469.56
the eyes sheer energy output and it

2467.19 --> 2474.12
doesn't reach very far right but what if

2469.56 --> 2477.75
you just have lower levels like 4G 3G

2474.12 --> 2483.54
maybe maybe just go back to 3G and a

2477.75 --> 2486.24
half Mike wrote tried like very low

2483.54 --> 2489.24
energy transmitters that are relatively

2486.24 --> 2494.6699999999996
close so the entire output of signal

2489.24 --> 2497.3399999999997
becomes very slight very light yet it

2494.67 --> 2500.46
would reach everywhere how about that

2497.34 --> 2504.09
certainly so low so much less energy

2500.46 --> 2506.7
would be required and you'd have

2504.09 --> 2509.1600000000003
functioning mobiles and hey you want to

2506.7 --> 2513.96
go raw downloading [ __ ]

2509.16 --> 2516.569
no well think about for example the

2513.96 --> 2518.73
original telephone booths okay

2516.569 --> 2521.94
Oh what now if you just have these

2518.73 --> 2525.299
points where it's like internet download

2521.94 --> 2528.359
points and you have them like in the

2525.299 --> 2531.42
city wherever I don't know pay for

2528.359 --> 2534.299
system whatever and it's just like okay

2531.42 --> 2536.9700000000003
well dude I just saw this freaking movie

2534.299 --> 2542.579
man it's a free download I'm gonna get

2536.97 --> 2546.1499999999996
it but yeah over the phone you know so

2542.579 --> 2550.4100000000003
you just take the phone you put it click

2546.15 --> 2552.78
on the downloading station you take a

2550.41 --> 2555.569
little plug or it's even like a clicking

2552.78 --> 2558.5690000000004
instant plug system whatever something

2555.569 --> 2563.3089999999997
figure it out put it in there it's like

2558.569 --> 2568.46
click download soup you have it like 2

2563.309 --> 2573.0
gigabytes you have it there you go done

2568.46 --> 2576.42
no wireless crap being sent out nothing

2573.0 --> 2579.569
you just go to download budget tick yeah

2576.42 --> 2583.099
like our have like a list of things you

2579.569 --> 2587.19
want to download oh [ __ ] you know now

2583.099 --> 2588.869
basic browser information should be

2587.19 --> 2592.14
exempt for that you know leave the

2588.869 --> 2593.94
picture data movies except you could

2592.14 --> 2597.48
leave that out there and then still just

2593.94 --> 2600.18
use the regular g3 or whatever it is for

2597.48 --> 2602.7
basic internet browsing but if you just

2600.18 --> 2605.64
wanna completely download [ __ ] go to

2602.7 --> 2608.22
download ponents like ok updates and

2605.64 --> 2610.65
like everything's you instantly

2608.22 --> 2612.39
downloaded through the glass wire cable

2610.65 --> 2616.71
that are just gonna be everywhere how

2612.39 --> 2619.71
about that people no more freaking

2616.71 --> 2622.619
radiation everywhere no more dead bees

2619.71 --> 2624.93
everywhere no more cancer no more brain

2622.619 --> 2628.1400000000003
cancer no more leukemia how about that

2624.93 --> 2631.68
people when is this gonna be installed I

2628.14 --> 2635.7889999999998
want that I want that I've been wanting

2631.68 --> 2639.72
that for 30 years why do we have this

2635.789 --> 2643.0200000000004
freaking 5g [ __ ] why are we just

2639.72 --> 2645.75
being attacked with Wireless like

2643.02 --> 2648.39
that unnecessarily so why are we being

2645.75 --> 2648.9
assaulted with technology for no good

2648.39 --> 2655.3199999999997
reason

2648.9 --> 2657.0
I'm sick of a literally sick of it yeah

2655.32 --> 2659.1000000000004
well people want more people can have

2657.0 --> 2662.22
mobile and if you didn't want to update

2659.1 --> 2664.3199999999997
all the files you walk to a download

2662.22 --> 2666.33
point you put your mobile on if you

2664.32 --> 2668.79
click a button click you wait two

2666.33 --> 2671.69
seconds and you got it what's the

2668.79 --> 2676.65
freaking problem why do you have to

2671.69 --> 2679.38
destroy everything to transfer you to

2676.65 --> 2683.04
Monza data through the air why why is

2679.38 --> 2686.73
this so important it's not it's not

2683.04 --> 2689.79
important it's completely useless it's

2686.73 --> 2693.8
completely [ __ ] to do that to want

2689.79 --> 2702.42
that with the cost that it brings it's

2693.8 --> 2704.4300000000003
completely [ __ ] I don't give a [ __ ]

2702.42 --> 2706.56
if it's been decided I don't give a [ __ ]

2704.43 --> 2708.93
what Satan decides and how we're all

2706.56 --> 2710.85
supposed to murder ones one another and

2708.93 --> 2713.16
and have ourselves be killed by this

2710.85 --> 2723.36
ridiculous [ __ ] I don't care if it's

2713.16 --> 2730.6499999999996
decided we must take control from within

2723.36 --> 2733.77
and just say piss off go away Satan

2730.65 --> 2738.6
we got the tech let's just do something

2733.77 --> 2741.21
sensible with this let's not use it to

2738.6 --> 2743.58
just destroy everything and walk away

2741.21 --> 2747.23
from any responsibility let's just not

2743.58 --> 2747.23
do that how about that

2752.13 --> 2761.4700000000003
yeah and look Steve look even yeah I'm

2758.8 --> 2763.0
not even saying like make wireless stuff

2761.47 --> 2767.68
completely illegal you know

2763.0 --> 2771.91
I'm just saying make it in a way if you

2767.68 --> 2776.7999999999997
want your Wireless thingy you know fine

2771.91 --> 2779.91
do it have that done but make sure that

2776.8 --> 2785.2000000000003
the system for the wireless transfer

2779.91 --> 2788.7999999999997
can't damage beyond a certain reach make

2785.2 --> 2790.93
it short range relatively low energy you

2788.8 --> 2793.17
know and controller information is fair

2790.93 --> 2799.75
it's it's bit information it's like

2793.17 --> 2801.55
which like 10 10 bit information stream

2799.75 --> 2804.76
that's nothing so it would require

2801.55 --> 2808.3300000000004
absolute nothing in energy to do that

2804.76 --> 2810.9100000000003
you know it's all about the mega data

2808.33 --> 2815.68
streams that's the problem that should

2810.91 --> 2817.6299999999997
be discarded completely in general but

2815.68 --> 2820.66
yeah if somebody wants to do it then

2817.63 --> 2822.37
make sure that they can damage anybody

2820.66 --> 2824.17
else you know what people want to do in

2822.37 --> 2826.8399999999997
their own freaking house if they want to

2824.17 --> 2830.11
put themselves in open microwaves like

2826.84 --> 2831.73
that and die you know they should

2830.11 --> 2833.8
definitely get a warning of the

2831.73 --> 2835.72
consequences and if they doesn't want to

2833.8 --> 2839.8500000000004
do that and just freakin kill themselves

2835.72 --> 2843.5499999999997
go ahead you freaking [ __ ] but don't

2839.85 --> 2846.58
take your neighbors with you in the

2843.55 --> 2849.1000000000004
process make sure that that cannot

2846.58 --> 2852.58
happen make sure that those systems

2849.1 --> 2855.25
cannot do that under any circumstance

2852.58 --> 2857.83
not within the technical capability of

2855.25 --> 2861.49
the systems that are being applied make

2857.83 --> 2864.8199999999997
sure that they can never do that under

2861.49 --> 2869.79
any circumstances without adding on

2864.82 --> 2869.79
equipment or [ __ ] it's as simple as that

2881.26 --> 2891.9300000000003
Oh glass shatters FM radio still there

2887.5 --> 2891.93
right I know

2897.12 --> 2900.27
all right

2919.48 --> 2922.23
hmm

2940.35 --> 2946.71
right yeah that's weird I was just

2943.83 --> 2951.02
realizing that technically you could

2946.71 --> 2955.08
even make data transfers over ham radios

2951.02 --> 2957.54
what's that it's all about just encoding

2955.08 --> 2962.48
the data kind of like how original

2957.54 --> 2965.94
modems worked remember the the up the

2962.48 --> 2970.37
calling sounds and all that it's like a

2965.94 --> 2976.11
code system well those are basically

2970.37 --> 2979.5
audio signals that is data in a way it's

2976.11 --> 2983.06
a specific code in audio well you could

2979.5 --> 2986.1
technically do that over radio as well

2983.06 --> 2989.5499999999997
you could literally upload the

2986.1 --> 2993.15
information if somebody else has a radio

2989.55 --> 2995.7000000000003
transceiver and a decoder for that it's

2993.15 --> 2999.4500000000003
weird how that works it wouldn't be too

2995.7 --> 3003.97
broad a stream you know data wise but

2999.45 --> 3007.58
still yeah you could potentially have I

3003.97 --> 3013.16
don't know like 10 pages of data and

3007.58 --> 3015.3199999999997
then transfer it into I don't know it's

3013.16 --> 3019.0099999999998
at one minute our signal I think

3015.32 --> 3024.17
probably I don't know this is all prior

3019.01 --> 3028.3900000000003
primitive [ __ ] is but yeah I even

3024.17 --> 3028.39
thought of that like 30 years ago

3028.9 --> 3033.8
like yeah sure that's possible it's all

3031.43 --> 3036.3799999999997
about just you code it and you have a

3033.8 --> 3038.6800000000003
decoder you couldn't use a lot of things

3036.38 --> 3038.6800000000003
for that

3051.07 --> 3062.07
right but I really think that that my

3056.88 --> 3064.9
replacement system for for yeah for

3062.07 --> 3066.4900000000002
mobile phone systems with the download

3064.9 --> 3070.51
punch I think that's a really good

3066.49 --> 3072.8199999999997
system and I've seen other people use

3070.51 --> 3075.07
that in a way before like when they only

3072.82 --> 3077.71
had low internet capability they would

3075.07 --> 3079.78
use it they would prioritize their

3077.71 --> 3082.75
browsers in certain ways to make sure

3079.78 --> 3086.11
that they only got the necessary data in

3082.75 --> 3086.98
first and then only when it became

3086.11 --> 3089.61
available

3086.98 --> 3092.5
things like picture data would be

3089.61 --> 3096.94
uploaded and then from their own the

3092.5 --> 3097.48
data of those locations are saved within

3096.94 --> 3100.57
it

3097.48 --> 3102.94
yeah within a browser file as it were so

3100.57 --> 3104.5
anytime you go there you just download

3102.94 --> 3106.6
the browser file so you only have to

3104.5 --> 3108.82
load things once so unless you're

3106.6 --> 3112.81
literally just going to go to new sites

3108.82 --> 3116.0800000000004
constantly just swim around if you go to

3112.81 --> 3120.25
the relatively the same sites you only

3116.08 --> 3122.77
really need to upload things once so you

3120.25 --> 3125.08
don't need all that internet capability

3122.77 --> 3126.97
really most of the time it's when you

3125.08 --> 3131.02
want to download videos with it

3126.97 --> 3134.89
oh then go to a download point go to a

3131.02 --> 3136.78
download point updates whatever you came

3134.89 --> 3140.08
across that requires a little bit more

3136.78 --> 3144.28
data stream and just go to the point

3140.08 --> 3147.18
click a button done you don't need you

3144.28 --> 3147.1800000000003
know it's

3160.41 --> 3164.96
hmm glad to hear it Gideon sick

3177.33 --> 3182.13
oh great don't remind me about it bait

3179.82 --> 3188.06
60 RMC don't even get me started about

3182.13 --> 3191.46
that [ __ ] because I have a lot of weird

3188.06 --> 3193.47
sensations in the night specific time

3191.46 --> 3195.21
base it's not depending on whether I am

3193.47 --> 3197.22
in bed trying to sleep or anything

3195.21 --> 3199.4700000000003
although it tends to happen typically

3197.22 --> 3202.14
then but even when I sit around

3199.47 --> 3205.2599999999998
sometimes I can just hear certain types

3202.14 --> 3206.7599999999998
of noises that I can't pinpoint where

3205.26 --> 3209.61
they're coming from and it's almost like

3206.76 --> 3211.7700000000004
I just wonder how they're there like is

3209.61 --> 3214.79
it some kind of machine that's

3211.77 --> 3216.87
resonating way way in the distance just

3214.79 --> 3219.87
happened to come here or is something

3216.87 --> 3225.12
else going on it disturbs me greatly so

3219.87 --> 3228.98
I don't know I'm not having sensations

3225.12 --> 3231.69
where I just get really feel really ill

3228.98 --> 3234.5
like I'm having an energy attack or

3231.69 --> 3236.88
something I don't have that sensation I

3234.5 --> 3241.05
haven't really had that no the only way

3236.88 --> 3246.21
I have bad experiences is basically from

3241.05 --> 3248.9700000000003
from within it's not doesn't seem to be

3246.21 --> 3251.52
like I'm put in a microwave versus I

3248.97 --> 3255.6
don't experience it like that but I feel

3251.52 --> 3257.46
there is something around just but I

3255.6 --> 3262.0499999999997
don't even know if it is something that

3257.46 --> 3264.15
is that I pick up through my physical 3d

3262.05 --> 3270.77
based senses or that I'm picking it up

3264.15 --> 3273.9
through my empathy from I don't know my

3270.77 --> 3279.5
my my contact with the world I don't

3273.9 --> 3279.5
know I know yeah that

3281.58 --> 3289.14
I just know that when I see genuine

3284.31 --> 3294.2599999999998
things they tend to make a lot of impact

3289.14 --> 3294.2599999999998
on me I resonate greatly with him

3300.9 --> 3303.9500000000003
what does that mean

3304.869 --> 3308.29
vampires what

3311.96 --> 3315.4900000000002
are you guys talking about

3328.18 --> 3335.0499999999997
all right yeah you mean the effective

3332.53 --> 3337.3300000000004
down switch paid sixty rmz oh yeah I've

3335.05 --> 3342.19
experienced that one as well plenty of

3337.33 --> 3344.95
times now where it comes from why that

3342.19 --> 3348.1
happens it's like yeah all of your

3344.95 --> 3350.23
technology is suddenly just faltering so

3348.1 --> 3351.64
thank God my computer doesn't like hard

3350.23 --> 3354.22
crash or anything it seems to be

3351.64 --> 3356.92
relatively protected for that very happy

3354.22 --> 3363.04
about that but like internet connection

3356.92 --> 3365.83
and [ __ ] and like my lamp my freaking

3363.04 --> 3368.71
lamp I'm gonna replace that [ __ ]

3365.83 --> 3371.59
thing because sometimes it's like this

3368.71 --> 3374.9700000000003
weird feedback starts to happen and all

3371.59 --> 3378.78
my devices like go deeply pretty

3374.97 --> 3383.4399999999996
literally hear the sounds like they're

3378.78 --> 3385.86
there from that thing is they did

3383.44 --> 3389.11
anything like what the [ __ ] is this like

3385.86 --> 3391.51
the network of things certainly getting

3389.11 --> 3393.28
in the order from the electricity net to

3391.51 --> 3396.55
relay their data or something and I'm

3393.28 --> 3398.8
like shut the hell up immediately turn

3396.55 --> 3401.92
it off it's very disturbing when it

3398.8 --> 3403.9
starts blinking [ __ ] and it doesn't

3401.92 --> 3414.76
burst it doesn't go off now it just

3403.9 --> 3416.92
blinked and then stops again hey I'm

3414.76 --> 3421.48
really gonna try to get a another time

3416.92 --> 3423.25
cuz this one just sucks but yeah I'd

3421.48 --> 3426.07
really I don't know what that is is that

3423.25 --> 3427.99
a brownout I've really doubt it it is

3426.07 --> 3431.4300000000003
like almost like a feedback loop it

3427.99 --> 3431.43
makes no sense what happens

3436.39 --> 3443.6189999999997
you think your television takes pictures

3438.91 --> 3446.67
I wouldn't be surprised if it did but

3443.619 --> 3449.1400000000003
you do get it like it's this jolt and

3446.67 --> 3452.2000000000003
suddenly things start to flicker and

3449.14 --> 3454.299
everything is like this ghost in the

3452.2 --> 3457.21
machine just wakes up and starts to do

3454.299 --> 3460.45
what it was designed to do and take

3457.21 --> 3463.059
pictures record [ __ ] transfer data

3460.45 --> 3464.7
through the network like all the goblins

3463.059 --> 3477.4
all wake up in your machines like a

3464.7 --> 3481.859
quickly it's like that isn't it I think

3477.4 --> 3481.859
it's extremely repulsive

3489.93 --> 3495.3289999999997
right well I don't have a TV but yeah I

3492.119 --> 3497.029
do have a Samsung monitor and it

3495.329 --> 3502.7000000000003
probably knows what the hell I'm doing

3497.029 --> 3502.7
it's probably seen some things you know

3503.66 --> 3510.93
what a single guy does sometimes very

3508.079 --> 3514.02
rarely these days thanks to Big Bear but

3510.93 --> 3516.2889999999998
it's like oh really really it's so

3514.02 --> 3520.859
important that you need to basically

3516.289 --> 3525.119
engineer that [ __ ] in there and violate

3520.859 --> 3530.5389999999998
the civil contract again the most insane

3525.119 --> 3534.2000000000003
way and then what to supposedly get some

3530.539 --> 3539.579
info that does not want to be shared

3534.2 --> 3543.4399999999996
it's insane and yeah me doesn't really

3539.579 --> 3548.94
work because I'm absolutely open about

3543.44 --> 3556.289
everything until yeah until like things

3548.94 --> 3559.099
become unreasonable or like risky you

3556.289 --> 3563.6090000000004
know I have risky ideas sometimes I just

3559.099 --> 3569.52
keep them to myself and try to avoid

3563.609 --> 3572.069
that as much as possible anyway I'm

3569.52 --> 3578.549
gonna round out the show it's been kind

3572.069 --> 3581.13
of all over the place router is on fire

3578.549 --> 3587.88
with the fifth generation I have no idea

3581.13 --> 3589.8900000000003
what it all means guys alright so anyway

3587.88 --> 3591.6600000000003
