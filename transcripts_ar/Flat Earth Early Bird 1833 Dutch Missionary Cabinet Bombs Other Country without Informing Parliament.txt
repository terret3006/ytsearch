148.76 --> 156.35999999999999
2024

151.16 --> 156.35999999999999
temperature it's 4° C right makes

161.4 --> 164.84
sense seems like it's going to be like

163.64 --> 167.0
that this

164.84 --> 169.56
weekend around that

167.0 --> 171.319
temperature mostly clouded not freezing

169.56 --> 175.31900000000002
at night

171.319 --> 175.319
fine perfectly okay with

178.76 --> 181.76
that

182.84 --> 189.879
right so

186.12 --> 192.31900000000002
yeah this is the new time slot for the

189.879 --> 197.12
early bird

192.319 --> 197.11999999999998
show and it will remain so until further

199.319 --> 202.83999999999997
notice right in the

208.68 --> 216.15900000000002
meantime is it I've made a gift and

214.48 --> 219.51899999999998
go

216.159 --> 219.519
specifically for

221.72 --> 227.04
my financial

225.159 --> 231.92
situation

227.04 --> 235.68
and yeah 500 bucks or am

231.92 --> 238.319
out anybody wants me to be back on

235.68 --> 242.31900000000002
fed you do it through that gift and go

238.319 --> 247.879
when it reaches 500 I will go

242.319 --> 247.879
back and not under any other

260.519 --> 265.24
circumstance right so spread it far and

266.199 --> 271.52000000000004
wide especially to people over at fed

269.68 --> 275.039
because I'm not really expecting you

271.52 --> 277.32
guys to be paying all that don't think

275.039 --> 279.479
you even care that much if I go back at

277.32 --> 279.479
this

280.12 --> 288.24
point maybe you

282.28 --> 288.23999999999995
do but uh yeah that uh that

292.8 --> 298.72
fund the rwin debt neutralization

296.479 --> 300.15999999999997
package yeah that's separate from my

298.72 --> 304.28000000000003
actual

300.16 --> 307.199
monthly maintenance just to be able to

304.28 --> 309.88
eat

307.199 --> 312.40000000000003
so I'm not expecting my regular

309.88 --> 313.4
supporters to relay that their support

312.4 --> 316.52
over

313.4 --> 320.28
there but maybe you will I don't know

316.52 --> 323.52
but yeah then I will run out of food so

320.28 --> 324.44
but I'm I'm good for like this weekend

323.52 --> 327.44
or

324.44 --> 327.44
something

327.639 --> 334.72
think barely what happened well if you

332.44 --> 337.44
watched my shows yesterday I had two

334.72 --> 341.08000000000004
Early Bird shows

337.44 --> 341.08
amand then you would have

349.039 --> 356.52
known it basically comes down to

352.96 --> 361.479
this was doing my show I got over there

356.52 --> 364.19899999999996
over at Nathan's I got in I

361.479 --> 367.8
it seemed a bit chaotic over

364.199 --> 369.639
there but yeah I I tried to some point

367.8 --> 371.88
when I thought that it was catching on

369.639 --> 375.52
to what was talked about so I

371.88 --> 377.599
added just a bit of infotainment as I

375.52 --> 380.96
typically do and then Nathan proceeded

377.599 --> 384.28
to scoff at me and then tell me how this

380.96 --> 384.28
kind of behavior is

384.8 --> 390.039
exactly

386.4 --> 392.56
like that is I don't even remember

390.039 --> 394.84
exactly what the words were it rages me

392.56 --> 394.84
too

395.88 --> 400.599
much is basically just saying like

398.599 --> 402.36
because of your presence Arwin I'm

400.599 --> 403.8
losing money that's that's kind of the

402.36 --> 408.68
gist of it

403.8 --> 410.319
and I I will no longer accept remarks

408.68 --> 414.84000000000003
like that at

410.319 --> 418.16
all because I believe quite the

414.84 --> 420.0
contrary and I'm going to prove

418.16 --> 424.08000000000004
it by

420.0 --> 426.68
retracting from the Flat Earth debates

424.08 --> 429.84
and and let's see how financially

426.68 --> 432.12
detrimental my presence really was let

429.84 --> 433.919
let's see how much money you make

432.12 --> 435.12
because I'm no longer there to get in

433.919 --> 441.15999999999997
your

435.12 --> 441.16
way yeah and if you want me back 500

445.199 --> 451.319
bucks and that's how it

448.319 --> 451.319
is

457.52 --> 461.68
oh no I'm joking no I am not joking he

459.639 --> 464.16
did that yeah and it's the second time

461.68 --> 464.16
he did

464.28 --> 470.44
that and that's after he already knew

468.159 --> 472.96
that I'm in financial that I have been

470.44 --> 476.4
building up Financial issues for quite a

472.96 --> 480.12
while but but he thinks that that's that

476.4 --> 482.96
that's the way to go then yeah I I think

480.12 --> 485.52
he really cares

482.96 --> 489.71999999999997
more about his

485.52 --> 491.71999999999997
virtual profit margin growth whatever in

489.72 --> 496.639
this case I think he's more caught up

491.72 --> 499.52000000000004
with that than than with me I mean all

496.639 --> 503.039
that waffling

499.52 --> 506.19899999999996
afterward of like oh oh Arwin oh yeah

503.039 --> 509.639
yeah seriously go [ __ ]

506.199 --> 514.0
yourself yeah you think I'm going to go

509.639 --> 517.0
back after you all it's all oh

514.0 --> 519.479
no now you made it you pretty much made

517.0 --> 524.36
a straightforward accusation that you're

519.479 --> 528.0400000000001
repeating yeah like some spousal

524.36 --> 530.92
argument which is just completely wrong

528.04 --> 530.92
and I will not

534.44 --> 540.0
accept and I even said it the last time

537.48 --> 542.32
he did that like never do that again

540.0 --> 544.12
again I said it to the other guys

542.32 --> 546.36
because he wasn't there yet I barely

544.12 --> 548.92
even have the opportunity to to talk to

546.36 --> 552.5600000000001
Nathan about these things he's not all

548.92 --> 556.04
that Comm communicative you know except

552.56 --> 559.04
for in show in

556.04 --> 559.04
format

563.16 --> 568.12
so all right tell me yeah I know it is

565.8 --> 571.12
fair it is fair and it is

568.12 --> 571.12
necessary

577.959 --> 584.5999999999999
so yeah share

580.56 --> 584.5999999999999
it share the gifts and

588.88 --> 594.64
go right it doesn't necess look hey just

593.32 --> 597.2
read the

594.64 --> 599.399
text maybe there's people that don't

597.2 --> 601.72
necessarily even care about my show or

599.399 --> 605.16
whatever they don't just like to see a

601.72 --> 607.839
guy that's trying to speak the truth or

605.16 --> 610.24
whatever get kicked out on the street

607.839 --> 611.9200000000001
maybe maybe that's the reason people

610.24 --> 614.12
would want to donate to

611.92 --> 617.4799999999999
that it's all

614.12 --> 620.32
good but I'm not coming back until that

617.48 --> 620.32

646.639 --> 652.519
there even and even if it's if it's at

649.519 --> 655.36
490 for 5 years I'm going to leave it

652.519 --> 658.04
there until it is at 500 and that's when

655.36 --> 661.04
I'm going to come

794.32 --> 798.9200000000001
that but I mean it's still crazy

subject yesterday was overall rowdy was

811.32 --> 816.48
everywhere did you know that now I have

813.92 --> 820.16
like trolls over at Owen Benjamin

816.48 --> 823.72
chat that are literally just like

820.16 --> 826.48
continually saying how I'm apparently an

823.72 --> 829.279
agent they even called me mad at some

826.48 --> 834.279
point like those guys are [ __ ]

829.279 --> 836.72

846.04 --> 851.279
three guys over there like what the [ __ ]

848.56 --> 855.04
is wrong with you

851.279 --> 857.24
people like I'm just trying to watch an

855.04 --> 859.56
Owen Benjamin stream and have giving

857.24 --> 862.199
some side

859.56 --> 864.7199999999999
commentary it's C these people are

862.199 --> 864.7199999999999
[ __ ]

867.68 --> 870.68
nuts

872.8 --> 879.399
hello steamy traveler good see

874.839 --> 879.399
you dere 306 good to see

893.16 --> 899.4399999999999
you all right also in the

896.16 --> 901.759
meantime the Netherlands just got

899.44 --> 906.0
involved in another war and they didn't

901.759 --> 908.8000000000001
even [ __ ] tell the

906.0 --> 911.92
parliament they

908.8 --> 914.279
secretly went

911.92 --> 916.199
ahead that's like the first time that's

914.279 --> 919.32
ever happen in the Netherlands and this

916.199 --> 919.3199999999999
is going to be

919.399 --> 926.36
like well it's probably the biggest

922.399 --> 930.24
Scandal that we've ever

926.36 --> 931.72
had and it's going to roll

930.24 --> 935.639
totally

931.72 --> 938.839
insane so apparently this another

935.639 --> 941.6
freaking Coalition England United States

938.839 --> 945.44
and the Netherlands in there too

941.6 --> 948.72
basically just like bombed hooes over at

945.44 --> 951.72
Yen and they didn't even tell the

948.72 --> 954.36
parliament yeah this Dem missionary

951.72 --> 958.0790000000001
cabinet it's not even really in power

954.36 --> 959.639
just a placeholder until the next one

958.079 --> 964.4399999999999
they just

959.639 --> 965.36
engaged in a war without even telling

964.44 --> 968.36
the

965.36 --> 968.36
parliament

979.56 --> 984.319
yeah I uh yeah if you look at my Twitter

983.199 --> 987.319
I

984.319 --> 989.5999999999999
reposted like a

987.319 --> 991.399
tweet that

989.6 --> 994.12
did I oh wait no I

991.399 --> 998.839
didn't I reposted on

994.12 --> 1000.72
Benjamins I love that video so

998.839 --> 1005.639
hilarious and

1000.72 --> 1008.6800000000001
true and triggering but no uh no but it

1005.639 --> 1011.72
was going around on Twitter I'm I'm I'm

1008.68 --> 1014.079
not calling it X guys I don't care it's

1011.72 --> 1014.0790000000001
so

1017.48 --> 1022.44
stupid

1020.04 --> 1022.4399999999999
where is

1030.679 --> 1037.679
it

1033.199 --> 1040.4
huh oh I didn't expect that Nathan twe

1037.679 --> 1043.3600000000001
tweeted about my rinn's death

1040.4 --> 1044.919
neutralization package I didn't even do

1043.36 --> 1046.0
that on my own Twitter I never thought

1044.919 --> 1050.4
of

1046.0 --> 1050.4
that I should probably do that

1051.4 --> 1058.3190000000002
that's actually a good

1054.78 --> 1058.319
[Music]

1074.88 --> 1080.679
point so that's just tweet it that

1091.96 --> 1095.8400000000001
out wow teret

1096.08 --> 1102.96
I I I mean it my greatest recommendation

1099.88 --> 1106.24
is just you just stay away just ter just

1102.96 --> 1111.08
think of him Jamie is

1106.24 --> 1113.76
like like a pet of Flat Earth yeah yeah

1111.08 --> 1115.559
they say crazy things they might

1113.76 --> 1119.48
pictures of you and all that and dance

1115.559 --> 1120.48
around with you just ignore it you just

1119.48 --> 1125.44
walk

1120.48 --> 1125.44
away that's that's my

1131.48 --> 1136.4
recommendation I mean if you could like

1134.28 --> 1139.76
strike him for it if you're willing to

1136.4 --> 1142.4
try that sure I'm not even trying it

1139.76 --> 1144.559
anymore like besides like this freaking

1142.4 --> 1147.72
system is

1144.559 --> 1150.76
just the reporting system now is like

1147.72 --> 1152.32
really it keeps [ __ ] changing around

1150.76 --> 1155.679
man I don't even know how to do it

1152.32 --> 1160.039
anymore now I have to refigure it

1155.679 --> 1162.76
out but uh I mostly just try to ignore

1160.039 --> 1165.52
it and it would probably better for your

1162.76 --> 1170.24
own health if you did

1165.52 --> 1170.24
too I mean I can't stop you but

1170.52 --> 1176.28
I do recommend against it hey Richard G

1173.84 --> 1176.28
good to see

1195.6 --> 1200.24
you hey Michael Jones

1202.679 --> 1207.2800000000002
H hope I am well yeah I'm

1207.84 --> 1213.6
okay I'm still cooling off from just

1210.4 --> 1213.6000000000001
being really pissed

1213.799 --> 1218.52
off but I mean I still slept

1221.52 --> 1227.1589999999999
fine it just kind of feels like a

1223.72 --> 1228.72
breakup because it effectively

1227.159 --> 1231.64
is

1228.72 --> 1231.64
because I'm not going

1236.24 --> 1240.559
back did we get no of course

1240.76 --> 1243.76
not

1244.0 --> 1250.679
pery doesn't fill itself up in in a day

1248.159 --> 1250.679
what did you

1255.559 --> 1261.24
expect your chat M yes yes

1258.64 --> 1263.679
I know they want to Ravel us all apart

1261.24 --> 1266.919
until I

1263.679 --> 1270.919
leave they just want me off the internet

1266.919 --> 1270.919
now I'm worse than all of

1276.52 --> 1282.12
it cuz probably because I make them feel

1280.64 --> 1284.96
the the

1282.12 --> 1286.84
disgust of what they really are and if

1284.96 --> 1289.679
I'd be out of the way then they can just

1286.84 --> 1293.799
dilapidate and pull everything with them

1289.679 --> 1297.0
become fullblown demonic without anybody

1293.799 --> 1299.4
noticing they want me out of the

1297.0 --> 1301.64
way and everybody that follows me

1299.4 --> 1304.64
because it's you guys here that keep me

1301.64 --> 1304.64
here

1317.039 --> 1320.039
effectively

1330.44 --> 1337.6000000000001
I must make them burn

1333.72 --> 1337.6000000000001
yeah they're probably

1346.96 --> 1349.96
terrified

1354.44 --> 1357.559
and that's why you should just kind of

1356.159 --> 1360.679
leave it

1357.559 --> 1364.24
alone there it otherwise they're going

1360.679 --> 1367.799
to literally just encapsulate

1364.24 --> 1370.1200000000001
you and like try to get you to go over

1367.799 --> 1373.24
there again and again and again until it

1370.12 --> 1373.2399999999998
all becomes about

1375.2 --> 1380.279
you they just want you to stay that's

1378.36 --> 1383.559
all they ever want that's all they want

1380.279 --> 1386.559
with all people that somewhat have a

1383.559 --> 1386.559
resemblance of a

1406.88 --> 1409.88
soul

1436.88 --> 1439.88
for

1442.6 --> 1449.6
yeah anyway I'm still like this whole

1445.64 --> 1449.6000000000001
[ __ ] is still on my mind that they

1451.24 --> 1457.559
actually this the Netherland situation I

1454.12 --> 1460.1589999999999
mean this just

1457.559 --> 1463.559
happened and this is like

1460.159 --> 1466.7990000000002
unprecedented by every

1463.559 --> 1469.799
metric like this never

1466.799 --> 1469.799
happened

1489.32 --> 1494.36
anyway don't have Illuminati C on today

1492.32 --> 1498.76
but I do have a coffee on standby it's

1494.36 --> 1500.6789999999999
also my last coffee then I have to get

1498.76 --> 1503.1589999999999
new coffee or there will be no more

1500.679 --> 1506.44
coffee who are the military fighting the

1503.159 --> 1506.44
hooes in

1506.72 --> 1512.799
Yemen and it's not really fighting

1509.08 --> 1512.799
they're just bombing the [ __ ] out of

1526.679 --> 1529.679
him

1535.6 --> 1542.279
yeah no but it's probably because they

1538.32 --> 1544.36
have directly threatened like the uh

1542.279 --> 1547.08
transporter

1544.36 --> 1550.559
ships that move

1547.08 --> 1554.0
there they attacked some recently and so

1550.559 --> 1554.0
that's why that's happening but I

1554.2 --> 1560.159
mean in a way that was to be expected

1557.399 --> 1563.039
sure sure that something like that was

1560.159 --> 1566.7600000000002
going to happen but the way it happened

1563.039 --> 1570.679
is like they didn't even freaking

1566.76 --> 1573.8799999999999
inform anybody they just did it like a

1570.679 --> 1573.88
stinky little

1576.72 --> 1581.88
dictator right they didn't even say like

1579.0 --> 1585.0
oh yeah we're going to do

1581.88 --> 1588.3600000000001
this yeah they didn't even do that they

1585.0 --> 1591.36
just went ahead with it without saying

1588.36 --> 1591.36
anything

1594.12 --> 1598.9599999999998
this it's just the Pinnacle of

1597.279 --> 1602.32
dictatorial

1598.96 --> 1605.08
arrogance what they've engaged with now

1602.32 --> 1609.2
and this is probably this could actually

1605.08 --> 1612.559
lead to a revolution like this is

1609.2 --> 1612.559
just too

1614.559 --> 1619.6
far because of the arrogance of it

1620.48 --> 1625.84
so this year is going to be

1623.36 --> 1629.24
very messy I

1625.84 --> 1630.8799999999999
think I would not be surprised if in the

1629.24 --> 1632.24
not to distant Futures there's going to

1630.88 --> 1635.5590000000002
be big

1632.24 --> 1635.559
riots and

1636.52 --> 1642.6399999999999
[ __ ] because as soon as we actually try

1639.76 --> 1644.52
to now stop this crap they are literally

1642.64 --> 1646.76
going to like give a green light to all

1644.52 --> 1649.679
the [ __ ] weaponized migrants they let

1646.76 --> 1652.2
into like yeah go trash the place now

1649.679 --> 1654.3200000000002
yeah that's how that works just like the

1652.2 --> 1657.279
[ __ ] BLM rights in the United States

1654.32 --> 1659.6789999999999
they will do that they will do that

1657.279 --> 1662.08
literally

1659.679 --> 1664.44
that and then it's going to really hit

1662.08 --> 1667.6399999999999
the fan over here then it's going to be

1664.44 --> 1667.64
like a [ __ ] Civil

1670.2 --> 1675.919
War yeah cuz we're not just going to let

1674.2 --> 1678.24
them do that over here in the

1675.919 --> 1680.8400000000001
Netherlands there's people that are

1678.24 --> 1682.2
really [ __ ] sick of this [ __ ] and

1680.84 --> 1684.9599999999998
they're going to [ __ ] hunt those

1682.2 --> 1684.96
scumbags

1687.519 --> 1692.08
down the people that just like trashed

1690.2 --> 1697.279
the neighborhood and all

1692.08 --> 1700.4399999999998
that foreigners that came in take huge

1697.279 --> 1704.36
amounts of welfare money like way way

1700.44 --> 1708.44
more than I get okay as a born natural

1704.36 --> 1709.6789999999999
citizen way more and they just they're

1708.44 --> 1712.6000000000001
just

1709.679 --> 1715.64
thugs waiting to get

1712.6 --> 1719.24
orders from our illegitimate government

1715.64 --> 1721.48
to just like okay now trash the

1719.24 --> 1724.1200000000001
place that's what they're there for

1721.48 --> 1728.3600000000001
that's why they get paid so

1724.12 --> 1731.559
much they're thugs they're criminally

1728.36 --> 1733.399
governmen hired thugs that have been

1731.559 --> 1736.36
moved in and they will get the green

1733.399 --> 1739.399
light to trash the place if we try to

1736.36 --> 1739.399
stop the government

1747.0 --> 1752.0
other countries are they coming I don't

1748.799 --> 1752.0
know all over the

1754.279 --> 1763.2
place the country is not even that

1758.08 --> 1769.32
relevant it's the context it's how they

1763.2 --> 1769.32
were like L here they have contract

1774.919 --> 1779.279
in the United States that's like it's

1776.799 --> 1782.24
been like completely weaponized even

1779.279 --> 1785.279
like the contract system they even like

1782.24 --> 1786.44
financially exploit like they take it

1785.279 --> 1790.08
even

1786.44 --> 1793.039
further not just like import them like

1790.08 --> 1795.1589999999999
contract them they then also proceed to

1793.039 --> 1797.799
like take every freaking bit of money

1795.159 --> 1798.7600000000002
from those migrants they get in that way

1797.799 --> 1802.6
like a

1798.76 --> 1802.6
pimp it's totally

1805.2 --> 1811.679
sick this like Beyond any form of

1808.72 --> 1815.32
slavery that we've ever heard

1811.679 --> 1815.3200000000002
of they'll take it

1826.24 --> 1829.24
further

1840.799 --> 1845.039
now teret what's the

1856.24 --> 1860.44
point

1858.0 --> 1863.039
don't don't give him anything don't give

1860.44 --> 1866.88
him anything don't even be mad like I'm

1863.039 --> 1869.399
just like not getting mad over it yeah

1866.88 --> 1872.279
because that's the tactic the tactic is

1869.399 --> 1874.6789999999999
to get you mad that's why is a troll get

1872.279 --> 1876.799

like that I I don't even know exactly

1965.12 --> 1968.1589999999999
how they arrange it

1973.399 --> 1978.4799999999998
here I just know that if they're pushing

1976.679 --> 1981.48
this like

1978.48 --> 1981.48
that

1981.639 --> 1988.0
like they

1983.72 --> 1990.24
must have a reserve like that they must

1988.0 --> 1992.159
have some group that they can just push

1990.24 --> 1994.72
a button and they just start trashing

1992.159 --> 1997.96
the place otherwise why the hell would

1994.72 --> 2000.24
you risk even doing something like this

1997.96 --> 2000.24
like

2005.96 --> 2008.96
that

2035.96 --> 2038.96

2047.84 --> 2054.119
uses your content and to be fair teret

2050.96 --> 2056.159
you being in my chat is not your content

2054.119 --> 2059.8790000000004
that's my

2056.159 --> 2065.359
content but if is he actually like

2059.879 --> 2065.359
taking your own YouTube content or

2065.879 --> 2071.04
whatever then you could report his

2068.359 --> 2071.04
videos for

2077.24 --> 2084.6389999999997
that would I you want to continue what

2106.32 --> 2110.119
mean it's just a

2115.16 --> 2120.7999999999997
comment but I mean if it really offends

2117.96 --> 2123.44
you that much you can try to report it I

2120.8 --> 2125.96
mean if that's what you want to do with

2123.44 --> 2128.119
it like I'm not even making the effort

2125.96 --> 2132.52
anymore I'm just like I just want to

2128.119 --> 2132.52
ignore it all like they just don't

2133.44 --> 2139.4
exist I mean it's not going to

2136.359 --> 2140.52
stop if I go after him like that you

2139.4 --> 2143.48
know what's going to happen there's

2140.52 --> 2145.96
going to be like five other guys just as

2143.48 --> 2147.88
terrible and worse that are immediately

2145.96 --> 2151.079
going to pop up and I want the same

2147.88 --> 2153.48
thing yeah so I'm just like no it just

2151.079 --> 2153.48
doesn't

2154.2 --> 2160.0789999999997
exist it doesn't matter what he does or

2157.2 --> 2162.0789999999997
thinks or says or how he doesn't matter

2160.079 --> 2164.92
nothing he does

2162.079 --> 2167.1600000000003
matters and anybody that gives any kind

2164.92 --> 2169.92
of attention to guys like that

2167.16 --> 2173.04
especially positive comments are

2169.92 --> 2175.6800000000003
scumbags that I will not give any

2173.04 --> 2175.68
attention

2177.28 --> 2183.2400000000002
either yeah that's why I don't follow

2180.599 --> 2183.2400000000002
flat side

2183.4 --> 2187.88
anymore like

2185.72 --> 2190.4399999999996
ever

2187.88 --> 2192.6400000000003
I'm really glad of it by the way I feel

2190.44 --> 2196.44
great I feel

2192.64 --> 2200.68
great not watching [ __ ] flat side

2196.44 --> 2200.68
anymore the trash that he keeps

2200.72 --> 2205.68
around it's great I feel

2206.88 --> 2211.599
relieved and I'm probably going to feel

2209.319 --> 2214.8
relatively relieved not being part of

2211.599 --> 2218.319
the Flat Earth debates anymore

2214.8 --> 2221.119
either where literally my relatively

2218.319 --> 2224.64
stable mood and everything just get

2221.119 --> 2224.6400000000003
shattered out of nowhere for

2236.599 --> 2241.92
nothing so I don't have that problem

2239.0 --> 2245.599
anymore I can actually like be myself

2241.92 --> 2247.48

2245.599 --> 2251.2400000000002
Disturbed

2247.48 --> 2251.2400000000002
and psychologically

2251.44 --> 2256.96
attacked and then I don't even get any

2355.079 --> 2361.1600000000003
of that basically

2357.319 --> 2361.16
then yeah send it to

2365.44 --> 2368.44
PayPal

2376.28 --> 2382.48
these letters are like such a sore ey

2385.839 --> 2391.96
sore very tough to not get a headache

2389.0 --> 2394.88
trying to figure out what it says right

2391.96 --> 2396.839
ah yeah Dan thanks that is that is

2394.88 --> 2399.079
that's a very decent donation thank you

2396.839 --> 2399.0789999999997
very

2406.4 --> 2413.839
much

2408.68 --> 2417.359
nice yeah I hope it's going to be

2413.839 --> 2419.04
there by tomorrow probably going to be

2417.359 --> 2420.7999999999997
after the but even then if it's going to

2419.04 --> 2422.8
be after the weekend I can probably

2420.8 --> 2424.52
survive until then sorry don't worry

2422.8 --> 2427.2400000000002
about it Stevie wor you didn't

2424.52 --> 2428.4
know Stevie win

2427.24 --> 2431.64
it's

2428.4 --> 2431.64
okay thank

2440.28 --> 2447.079
you I'm sure Nathan is going to

2442.8 --> 2449.44
appreciate it although I mean like it

2447.079 --> 2451.5600000000004
could really it could just be like that

2449.44 --> 2451.56
you

2452.2 --> 2456.839
know I don't know for sure I don't know

2454.92 --> 2459.96
how this works I don't know if if we're

2456.839 --> 2461.56
like we've been designated by the Beast

2459.96 --> 2464.2
system for a

2461.56 --> 2466.52
breakup because it could very well be

2464.2 --> 2471.68
that now literally people are just going

2466.52 --> 2474.0
to roll a lot of money right on top of

2471.68 --> 2476.04
Nathan not because they want to support

2474.0 --> 2478.96
me but because they see an opportunity

2476.04 --> 2482.079
to permanently create a rift between us

2478.96 --> 2483.96
because that weird friendship we have

2482.079 --> 2487.52
might be really

2483.96 --> 2490.2
powerful and it frighten all of

2487.52 --> 2492.599
them and then yeah they're going to make

2490.2 --> 2495.16
sure that it's not like that it's not

2492.599 --> 2495.1600000000003
going to go

2500.48 --> 2506.119
back right because all that has to

2502.8 --> 2507.48
happen now is that Nathan just doesn't

2506.119 --> 2511.0
have me

2507.48 --> 2514.16
around and then finds out somehow that

2511.0 --> 2516.92
hey wow now our wind's gone now suddenly

2514.16 --> 2520.3999999999996
I'm it's all rolling in well if that

2516.92 --> 2522.839
happens then I'll probably never go back

2520.4 --> 2526.48
because then he'll literally not want me

2522.839 --> 2527.7999999999997
back he'll never say that he just won't

2526.48 --> 2532.52
want

2527.8 --> 2532.52
it because I'm bad for

2533.04 --> 2537.16
income I don't know if I am I kind of

2535.92 --> 2540.64
doubt

2537.16 --> 2543.5589999999997
it but may hey maybe they just plucked

2540.64 --> 2546.7599999999998
all the fruits and the ideas that I gave

2543.559 --> 2549.52
out freely while building up

2546.76 --> 2552.8390000000004
it's it's like oh thanks Arwin now

2549.52 --> 2555.96

2552.839 --> 2561.319

2555.96 --> 2561.319

2561.72 --> 2567.4399999999996
it we would never say that you are blah

2564.96 --> 2571.92
blah blah blah I'm [ __ ] dying here

[ __ ] do I need any [ __ ] online

2586.72 --> 2591.9199999999996

2589.079 --> 2595.6800000000003
to maintain because I won't have a

2591.92 --> 2599.119

I don't give a [ __ ] about [ __ ]

2618.72 --> 2623.1189999999997
friendship if that's going to lead to be

2620.68 --> 2626.1189999999997
being [ __ ]

2623.119 --> 2626.119

all that this stuff on the side when I'm

2821.119 --> 2826.48
like hustling to like get a living

2823.8 --> 2828.92
together somehow definitely taking up

2826.48 --> 2828.92
this time

2830.119 --> 2840.119
slot yeah because all [ __ ] jobs in

2834.92 --> 2843.119
the [ __ ] world take up this time slot

2840.119 --> 2846.4
always every [ __ ] conceivable job in

guess what if I do that I'm not going to

2870.96 --> 2875.559
be working the same way I do I'm not

2873.0 --> 2877.64
going to be like all fresh and energetic

2875.559 --> 2881.0400000000004
when when I do my show then at 2:00 it's

2885.319 --> 2889.92
it works and you need to stop whining

about

2889.92 --> 2895.4
it

2892.04 --> 2899.2799999999997

3468.4 --> 3474.64
and that creped up on me like that is

3472.039 --> 3476.5200000000004

3474.64 --> 3477.7599999999998
it

3476.52 --> 3480.119
and that's

3477.76 --> 3482.119

3492.0 --> 3497.319
is creeping Deb that's the only thing

3495.079 --> 3500.96
that I really that makes it

3497.319 --> 3500.96
insufferable on the long

3501.96 --> 3510.079
run yeah yeah yeah yeah whatever there

3505.319 --> 3510.079
it frozen I wouldn't say it I

3513.28 --> 3522.039
mean it's not frozen it's it's not stale

3518.359 --> 3525.64
that's what the trolls would now it's

3522.039 --> 3528.0
saturated that's what's really there

3525.64 --> 3528.0
it's

3533.72 --> 3537.4399999999996
saturated

3535.319 --> 3541.359
because I mean the information that I

3537.44 --> 3544.52
pick up there is extremely

3541.359 --> 3544.52
valuable it

3545.48 --> 3551.52
is and I like like doing just

3549.64 --> 3555.0
argumentation with the

3551.52 --> 3556.799
guys especially in the after after show

3555.0 --> 3559.039
it was all very interesting I learned a

3556.799 --> 3562.319
lot from it it's definitely not a

3559.039 --> 3562.3190000000004
useless show or

3563.4 --> 3571.6800000000003

I'm always shy for subjects things that

3697.92 --> 3703.6800000000003
are interesting to talk about news tips

3701.76 --> 3706.5200000000004
what did happen here what did happen

3703.68 --> 3710.72
that's why I'm where I'm always shy for

3706.52 --> 3716.359
for input like that things to talk about

3710.72 --> 3720.1189999999997
not suggestions on how to make my show

3716.359 --> 3722.88
wow yeah I'm I'm sure just copy pasting

3720.119 --> 3724.599
the same stupid spam over and over again

3722.88 --> 3727.119
in my chat and getting banned

3724.599 --> 3729.2000000000003
immediately never appearing on screen is

3727.119 --> 3732.599
really going to make a difference

3729.2 --> 3732.5989999999997
trolls dumb

3743.359 --> 3746.359
asses

3750.52 --> 3758.4
yeah yeah jug I know and and and it's

3754.16 --> 3760.5589999999997
funny because it's only Nathan that

3758.4 --> 3763.2000000000003
berates me for

3760.559 --> 3766.2400000000002
that did you know that I've never been

3763.2 --> 3769.9199999999996
berated on the Internet by any other

3766.24 --> 3773.16
person over that but Nathan he's the

3769.92 --> 3776.2000000000003
only [ __ ] person that has ever done

3773.16 --> 3780.52
that yeah Nathan projecting much no it's

3776.2 --> 3780.52
you that does that nobody else does

3782.24 --> 3791.319
that like Patricia yeah no it was great

3786.96 --> 3794.2
Patricia was arguably partly a motivate

3791.319 --> 3797.48
motivational factor for me to actually

3794.2 --> 3801.4399999999996
get on make this to do

3797.48 --> 3805.359
this she like pulled me out of the

3888.559 --> 3893.1600000000003
horribly

3889.76 --> 3894.88
wrong she never dated Mark

3893.16 --> 3896.92
sargeant

3894.88 --> 3899.0
they sure yeah they were spreading it's

3896.92 --> 3904.7200000000003
because they were like creating gossip

3899.0 --> 3904.72
[ __ ] for the fun of it they were not

3905.279 --> 3911.319
dating like they're just

3909.039 --> 3913.4
friends but there were always like

3911.319 --> 3915.52
people that were like oh she's having

3913.4 --> 3918.96

3915.52 --> 3921.64
[ __ ] around with it like like playing

3970.52 --> 3973.559
Earth had a crush in

3974.52 --> 3981.0389999999998
her but it's just the energy she had so

just so good at being a media

4077.64 --> 4083.4
representative guy like a PR guy face

4081.279 --> 4085.119
because he's like he's so unfaced

4083.4 --> 4087.279
nothing can face him and that's really

4085.119 --> 4091.2000000000003

4087.279 --> 4091.2
quality I really respect

4094.52 --> 4100.319

4159.279 --> 4166.159000000001

4162.279 --> 4169.0
point with how everybody is like it you

4166.159 --> 4173.5599999999995
can't not do

4169.0 --> 4176.159
that is the Chinese zo

4173.56 --> 4179.759
what I have no idea what you're talking

4176.159 --> 4181.2789999999995
about Amanda bra but uh like the

4179.759 --> 4184.12
background is

4181.279 --> 4186.279
animated maybe it's based on this

4184.12 --> 4188.92
mountain I don't know I've don't know

4186.279 --> 4192.96
this mountain never heard of

4188.92 --> 4194.56
it but the background is an is a 3D

4192.96 --> 4197.0
animation

4194.56 --> 4198.76
I don't know if it's based on a real

4197.0 --> 4201.239
place or if it's pure fiction I'm going

4198.76 --> 4204.08
to assume it's pure fiction just

4201.239 --> 4204.08
somebody made

4220.719 --> 4229.159
that yeah but no

4224.28 --> 4229.159
no I mean May

4230.08 --> 4237.08
nah it's too much hassle it's too much

4234.36 --> 4239.799999999999
friction I mean that's why Patricia got

4237.08 --> 4242.36
out right you do realize that she got

4239.8 --> 4245.88
out for a reason it's all the [ __ ]

4242.36 --> 4248.08
infighting and she doesn't want to then

4245.88 --> 4251.32
go oh go with

4248.08 --> 4254.04
Arwin because like

4251.32 --> 4257.04
I'm there's so much [ __ ] in fighting

4254.04 --> 4258.84
everywhere surrounding me it's like no

4257.04 --> 4261.88
how's that going to

4258.84 --> 4264.52
work just get trolled by all my [ __ ]

4261.88 --> 4267.32
trolls again she she's like glad to

4264.52 --> 4270.320000000001
finally be rid of all that

4267.32 --> 4270.32
crap

4274.08 --> 4284.719
so oh my wall oh shut up Amanda the

4280.4 --> 4287.96
[ __ ] it's not a crossbow well seeking

4284.719 --> 4291.88
star water at least we had one that got

4287.96 --> 4294.64
it right the first time in history

4291.88 --> 4296.719
yesterday so I I'm less going to be less

4294.64 --> 4298.84
angry for somebody calling it a crossbow

4296.719 --> 4303.36
again because that's like

4298.84 --> 4303.360000000001
99.9% of everybody that's ever guessed

4305.44 --> 4309.28
that so I'm

4312.56 --> 4315.56
good

4319.56 --> 4325.639
I recognize it yeah zugu that's a

4322.719 --> 4328.0
Chinese crossbow right I I vaguely

4325.639 --> 4329.88
remember the name reference because

4328.0 --> 4333.159
that's been used in video

4329.88 --> 4335.8
games there's like names of items then

4333.159 --> 4339.839999999999
you they sometimes pick just foreign

4335.8 --> 4342.4800000000005
words for that and I recognize it from

4339.84 --> 4345.4800000000005
games

4342.48 --> 4345.48
interesting

4346.96 --> 4351.28
maybe she could get it to

4348.96 --> 4353.76
stop

4351.28 --> 4356.28
how

4353.76 --> 4359.04
what the [ __ ] are you talking about are

4356.28 --> 4359.04
you talking to

4369.719 --> 4375.44
yourself This activi is becoming kind of

4373.159 --> 4375.44
sus

4377.12 --> 4382.12
supect for [ __ ] sake John there is no

4390.4 --> 4398.44
crossbow can see the strap for the

4394.239 --> 4401.799999999999
quiver yeah and the quiver is it's not

4398.44 --> 4403.599999999999
aligned with the rest of the bow I mean

4401.8 --> 4405.88
if it's a crossbow it's going to be

4403.6 --> 4408.400000000001
aligned it's going to be exactly in the

4405.88 --> 4411.2390000000005
middle of it that's not how that thing

4408.4 --> 4411.239
there is

4420.6 --> 4425.52
suspended right let's just show

4427.76 --> 4431.8
it see that's a

4432.36 --> 4435.36
bow

4448.639 --> 4452.639
B some Bows Oh that's

4453.52 --> 4458.159000000001

I never got to

4502.76 --> 4507.76
that CU I even did know people that did

4505.96 --> 4509.28
that sort of thing back then it's kind

4507.76 --> 4511.92
of weird how it

4509.28 --> 4514.8
just it's like I moved around too

4511.92 --> 4516.719
quickly and then it just all scattered

4514.8 --> 4520.28

4548.76 --> 4553.679
10 bucks and he'll wonder like they're

4551.12 --> 4557.239
treating me like a dog and it's [ __ ]

4553.679 --> 4562.0
over yeah no I'm not going to come back

4564.08 --> 4569.36
deal it's really cool the 10 bucks but

4567.679 --> 4572.04
it's going to have to be more than that

4569.36 --> 4572.04
so

4582.12 --> 4585.12

4620.239 --> 4626.08
there for money for them unless they're

4622.6 --> 4626.08
like in financial trouble or

4627.199 --> 4631.879999999999
whatever yeah well hey I'm not saying

4629.8 --> 4633.320000000001
that Nathan all needs to pay it out of

4631.88 --> 4636.84
his own pocket

4633.32 --> 4638.599999999999
duper he's got a community right I mean

4636.84 --> 4642.0
he could have like

4638.6 --> 4645.88
€2,000 worth of computer repair

4642.0 --> 4648.36
crap and that can be arranged well then

4645.88 --> 4651.32
I'm sure he can get 500 bucks together

4648.36 --> 4655.759999999999
to get Arwin back on the

4651.32 --> 4658.48
panel and if not well then his crowd

4655.76 --> 4660.6
doesn't feel that it's worth to get me

4658.48 --> 4664.36
back and so then I'm just not coming

4660.6 --> 4664.360000000001
back then that'll be

4672.0 --> 4675.0
that

4680.679 --> 4685.76
on going on that show any yeah exactly

4683.12 --> 4688.5599999999995
well it's not exactly there is a point

4685.76 --> 4690.76
to it but not if I'm going to like

4688.56 --> 4693.320000000001
permanently be losing money and never

4690.76 --> 4695.639
getting anything out of spending like

4693.32 --> 4700.799999999999
four to six hours a

4695.639 --> 4700.8
day on that show yeah

4701.08 --> 4706.679
definitely it's fun though it's just not

4708.04 --> 4712.48
durable unless I would get more support

4710.56 --> 4716.0
for the early birth show and then would

4712.48 --> 4716.0
remain very durable to do

4716.32 --> 4722.199
that but I'm not it's not working I mean

4720.239 --> 4724.44
I do get support from some of you guys

4722.199 --> 4727.28
I'm really thankful for that and it is

4724.44 --> 4731.36
what's keeping my show going but it

4727.28 --> 4733.5599999999995
hasn't prevented me from plunging into

4731.36 --> 4736.48
death as I warned

4733.56 --> 4738.4400000000005
about and I'm not like saying how dare

4736.48 --> 4741.638999999999
you all I mean everybody had it very

4738.44 --> 4745.96
tough this last few

4741.639 --> 4745.96
years but it is just what it

4747.56 --> 4752.2390000000005
is right and I've been warning about the

4750.199 --> 4754.08
risk of what would happen if I would

4752.239 --> 4756.4
financially collapse then the show is

4754.08 --> 4760.48
over that's what it's been it's how it's

4756.4 --> 4760.48
always been and it's going to

4761.84 --> 4765.92
be we're almost

4784.159 --> 4787.159
there

4791.84 --> 4794.84
okay

4798.0 --> 4803.36
just no it's not suspicious duper that's

4801.12 --> 4807.84
not suspicious at

4803.36 --> 4807.839999999999
all there's nothing

4808.36 --> 4814.32
no yeah there Nathan is not a [ __ ]

4811.88 --> 4814.32
scam

4817.4 --> 4822.799999999999
artist so every day and this computer

4820.48 --> 4825.12
never breaks oh really no it did break

4822.8 --> 4828.4800000000005
break down duper it broke

4825.12 --> 4832.199
down 2 years

4828.48 --> 4834.678999999999
ago like my computer like my entire

4832.199 --> 4837.4
motherboard had to be

4834.679 --> 4839.04
replaced I don't even remember how money

4837.4 --> 4841.199
how much money that

4839.04 --> 4844.12
cost

4841.199 --> 4846.44
wow oh [ __ ] you too

4844.12 --> 4851.599999999999
YouTube that's going to be your stance

4846.44 --> 4851.599999999999
well you're out now you're out forever

4851.719 --> 4854.719
[ __ ]

4857.96 --> 4863.4800000000005
right it's just

4859.52 --> 4867.4800000000005
that I don't have to have this

4863.48 --> 4870.599999999999
super Hightech machine that like does

4867.48 --> 4872.599999999999
all these insane things all together my

4870.6 --> 4874.4800000000005
show is a little bit more simple in its

4872.6 --> 4879.639
setup and that's

4874.48 --> 4879.638999999999
why I don't have constant issues with my

4881.639 --> 4884.639
computer

4907.199 --> 4912.919999999999
right yeah besides I think that Nathan's

4909.92 --> 4915.6
computer issues are mostly over I really

4912.92 --> 4915.6
think it

4919.159 --> 4926.199
is took damn long enough but yeah I mean

4923.44 --> 4929.32
it is what it is it was what it was and

4926.199 --> 4929.32
I I don't

4932.12 --> 4938.719
mind it's just that I need money to get

4935.56 --> 4938.719
out of thatb and that's

4941.56 --> 4944.56
it

4949.0 --> 4954.719
yeah and I can't just be pulled alongs

4951.92 --> 4957.76
side and ignored and just like oh it's

4954.719 --> 4960.679
all nice and cool and all I can't play

4957.76 --> 4963.04
nice anymore while my debt is growing I

4960.679 --> 4963.04
can't do

4971.56 --> 4974.56
it

4985.56 --> 4991.679
oh okay okay Richard G yeah thanks for

4987.96 --> 4991.679
being there it's always good to have you

4997.92 --> 5003.1990000000005
here yeah Stevie when I know it's called

5000.8 --> 5005.96
tinkering I literally War Nathan about

5003.199 --> 5012.04
it at the beginning of the

5005.96 --> 5015.84
ride he's been incredibly lucky to have

5012.04 --> 5018.679
escaped that final Doom which is usually

5015.84 --> 5020.6
what happens to people that go there

5018.679 --> 5022.719
that he's even got a stable working

5020.6 --> 5026.120000000001
computer out of it now it mean it cost

5022.719 --> 5028.56
him like dearly though right because it

5026.12 --> 5030.599999999999
does because what you end up doing is

5028.56 --> 5033.2390000000005
basically just replacing your entire

5030.6 --> 5036.159000000001
[ __ ] computer that's what happens

5033.239 --> 5039.199
when you Tinker you end up replacing

5036.159 --> 5044.0
your entire computer I've seen it too

5039.199 --> 5046.28
many times as in twice and then from the

5044.0 --> 5052.12
person that had

5046.28 --> 5052.12
that like telling me about how people do

5053.92 --> 5058.56
that like in a bit weird days he even

5057.239 --> 5063.04
like

5058.56 --> 5065.080000000001
joked yeah joked about yeah you really

5063.04 --> 5067.92
somebody really gets on your

5065.08 --> 5069.8
nerves just tell him about tinkering and

5067.92 --> 5073.76
improving your computer show him how to

5069.8 --> 5076.360000000001
do it and you can [ __ ] him up that way

5073.76 --> 5077.8
yeah they they'll go and do it and then

5076.36 --> 5080.839999999999
they can't stop and then their

5077.8 --> 5082.639
computer's gone it's over and they can't

5080.84 --> 5084.8
pay for a new

5082.639 --> 5087.2390000000005
one

5084.8 --> 5089.04
right now in the internet if you already

5087.239 --> 5091.36
have a show and a following and you have

5089.04 --> 5092.92
income then you might Escape that right

5091.36 --> 5096.839999999999
but in general

5092.92 --> 5099.8
back then I guess like 20 years ago it

5096.84 --> 5099.8
didn't work like that

5102.28 --> 5109.4
yet tinkering is the death of computer

5106.84 --> 5109.400000000001
that's what it

5112.199 --> 5116.5199999999995
is like I don't I just

5116.56 --> 5120.76
don't like if I'm going to assemble a

5118.96 --> 5122.679
computer I might get it to like the

5120.76 --> 5127.08
computer guy and ask him to like could

5122.679 --> 5131.159
you just like set it all that it's like

5127.08 --> 5133.76
that it can handle this and that and

5131.159 --> 5136.92
that like I'll discuss it and you'll do

5133.76 --> 5139.6
the settings just take like five minutes

5136.92 --> 5142.04
or something and that's it then it's

5139.6 --> 5144.52
done now my computer is set that way

5142.04 --> 5149.08
it's going to be [ __ ] stable it's

5144.52 --> 5149.080000000001
going to stay stable for like a

5149.88 --> 5155.32
decade no more tinkering just one one

5152.6 --> 5155.320000000001
time

5164.52 --> 5169.52
done that's right Jo well I'm glad I'm

5167.44 --> 5172.159
glad because that means that you can

5169.52 --> 5174.159000000001
actually enjoy a great computer without

5172.159 --> 5178.799999999999
constant Hassle and extra

5174.159 --> 5178.799999999999
costs which is the way a computer should

5181.199 --> 5187.04
be have him come around once okay well I

5184.639 --> 5188.56
can't technically afford that I just did

5187.04 --> 5191.28
the one time and then I don't mess

5188.56 --> 5193.4400000000005
around with it for me it's like okay I

5191.28 --> 5197.0
need to periodically blow the dust out

5193.44 --> 5199.839999999999
of the box and that's it that's really

5197.0 --> 5199.84
all I need to

5201.76 --> 5205.92
do build your uncle yeah me

5210.159 --> 5217.159
too H grabbing old PCS yeah people mess

5213.96 --> 5219.8
up their computer so bad they throw

5217.159 --> 5221.96
their computer out because like they're

5219.8 --> 5226.04
operating systems too slow because they

5221.96 --> 5227.8
install too much crap and that like fire

5226.04 --> 5229.76
like people throw their computer away

5227.8 --> 5232.4800000000005
because a virus has bed down the

5229.76 --> 5236.84
operating system it's so

5232.48 --> 5236.839999999999
ridiculous and that still happens that

5237.92 --> 5245.08
crap like You' think that like after 30

5241.4 --> 5246.92
years of being being fully immersed in

5245.08 --> 5249.92
computer

5246.92 --> 5253.36
culture like like we have that people

5249.92 --> 5255.08
would figure out like no no that's not a

5253.36 --> 5257.88
good reason to throw your computer out

5255.08 --> 5263.04
you have to just fix it and still people

5257.88 --> 5263.04
out there just don't don't get it it's

5265.84 --> 5269.4800000000005
incredible but uh

5269.52 --> 5275.320000000001
yeah companies yeah they yeah especially

5273.04 --> 5276.679
companies but I mean there's plenty of

5275.32 --> 5278.08
people that are going to be in the

5276.679 --> 5282.52
company like oh you're going to throw

5278.08 --> 5286.36
computers at I'll take it I'll take

5282.52 --> 5289.1990000000005
that so right especially now because

5286.36 --> 5292.5199999999995
computers are going to become more

5289.199 --> 5292.5199999999995
difficult to

5293.159 --> 5299.36
assemble parts are becoming more

5296.0 --> 5299.36
expensive there's

5299.719 --> 5306.56
like price Wars happening with that

5303.52 --> 5309.2390000000005
[ __ ] especially graphic cards I've

5306.56 --> 5312.84
heard it's

5309.239 --> 5315.48
weird but yeah the computer market and

5312.84 --> 5318.4800000000005
availability isn't what it used to be

5315.48 --> 5318.48
like 10 years

5323.92 --> 5332.08
ago right so I think like in this age

5328.8 --> 5334.2390000000005
actually like computer repair and

5332.08 --> 5336.28
reassemble like finding parts and

5334.239 --> 5338.0
putting them older Parts putting them

5336.28 --> 5341.159
together making it work and making it

5338.0 --> 5344.08
work well is like going to be like

5341.159 --> 5345.44
really valuable skill because I think

5344.08 --> 5346.679
that computers are going to be much

5345.44 --> 5350.799999999999
harder to

5346.679 --> 5350.8
get in the not to distant

5352.08 --> 5358.719
future until like an industrial change

5355.56 --> 5362.1990000000005
is happen is happening

5358.719 --> 5365.28
like if the West starts to like really

5362.199 --> 5367.5199999999995
make a comeback in like computer part

5365.28 --> 5370.719
production which it it doesn't really

5367.52 --> 5373.8
have right now it's very

5370.719 --> 5377.119
small in America there's some but it's

5373.8 --> 5379.639
like yeah I mean China and all that's

5377.119 --> 5382.5199999999995
like super overproducing they're totally

5379.639 --> 5384.04
dominating the world with that [ __ ] and

5382.52 --> 5386.639
that's problematic because they're using

5384.04 --> 5388.5199999999995
it against

5386.639 --> 5393.4400000000005
us

5388.52 --> 5396.0
financially man to manipulate so

5393.44 --> 5398.799999999999
until there's like a production comeback

5396.0 --> 5401.36
from the West in computer parts will be

5398.8 --> 5405.04
very wise for a lot of people that are

5401.36 --> 5409.36
into computers to really learn about old

5405.04 --> 5411.719
Parts finding old Parts repairing them

5409.36 --> 5414.88
like keeping them

5411.719 --> 5416.44
safe from people's foolishness of

5414.88 --> 5419.159000000001
throwing old things

5416.44 --> 5421.48
out cuz a lot of these older things

5419.159 --> 5424.32
actually tend to work better than the

5421.48 --> 5426.159
newer stuff that's coming out why

5424.32 --> 5429.159
because the production standard is going

5426.159 --> 5431.92
down because those Mega corporations are

5429.159 --> 5434.36
like yeah we don't care

5431.92 --> 5436.2390000000005
anymore you're going to buy our stuff

5434.36 --> 5437.96
because we're the only ones selling and

5436.239 --> 5440.678999999999
we don't care that it's going to break

5437.96 --> 5443.119
on you because you have nowhere else to

5440.679 --> 5444.719
go you're just going to buy more of that

5443.119 --> 5446.5599999999995
stuff that's going to break very quickly

5444.719 --> 5450.84
off us because there's nobody else

5446.56 --> 5452.719
producing it and so recycling Aller

5450.84 --> 5457.400000000001
parts

5452.719 --> 5457.4
can be like a way out of

5468.52 --> 5474.320000000001
that that was being discussed there no

5471.0 --> 5474.32
doubt I'm sure they

5480.76 --> 5483.76
will

5489.119 --> 5495.5199999999995
pces don't need tuning yeah they

5492.159 --> 5498.32
do when you assemble them there's a lot

5495.52 --> 5501.0
like more now than

5498.32 --> 5503.44
ever a lot of times when you now

5501.0 --> 5506.48
completely assemble a PC from scratch

5503.44 --> 5509.839999999999
with the newer Parts if you don't tune

5506.48 --> 5512.159
them the computer won't even turn

5509.84 --> 5514.2390000000005
on like you can't even get get it to

5512.159 --> 5516.44
start up like

5514.239 --> 5518.48
because it's just being there's

5516.44 --> 5519.719
something about factory settings that's

5518.48 --> 5522.638999999999
getting

5519.719 --> 5525.36
derailed it used to be

5522.639 --> 5527.36
that when you bought like a graphics

5525.36 --> 5530.4
card or whatever it would already be

5527.36 --> 5532.799999999999
tuned to be perfectly compatible now

5530.4 --> 5535.32
they don't seem they seem to like not do

5532.8 --> 5537.4400000000005
that anymore with a whole bunch of them

5535.32 --> 5540.759999999999
this is really weird but that's I heard

5537.44 --> 5543.159
that from Nathan he did research on it

5540.76 --> 5545.84
so I'm going to assume that he didn't

5543.159 --> 5545.839999999999
just make that

5546.56 --> 5554.0
up but you definitely need to ATT tune

5550.88 --> 5556.92
to tune your PCS if you assemble them

5554.0 --> 5556.92
from scratch these

5557.199 --> 5562.32
days you can't tune a fish that's

5559.84 --> 5562.32
hilarious

5565.56 --> 5572.320000000001
TV apple is expensive yeah it's also

5568.92 --> 5575.159
totally China blue build evolution

5572.32 --> 5575.159
no apple is

5588.28 --> 5593.88
[ __ ] apple is like the Prototype of

5591.4 --> 5596.799999999999
marketing that they're doing give a

5593.88 --> 5599.36
product it will work great until it

5596.8 --> 5601.8
stops working great and then it won't

5599.36 --> 5604.0
work anymore and then you have to buy

5601.8 --> 5607.119000000001
the new version even though it's like

5604.0 --> 5609.52
exactly the same you have to you must

5607.119 --> 5613.04
pay them giant amounts of money to have

5609.52 --> 5616.76
to retain a functioning device that's

5613.04 --> 5621.04
the model it's Apple that's going to be

5616.76 --> 5624.719
Universal with like all [ __ ] computer

5621.04 --> 5627.76
parts yeah you get a thing it works

5624.719 --> 5630.32
great and then it doesn't anymore why

5627.76 --> 5632.280000000001
because they turn it off and you can't

5630.32 --> 5634.36
do anything about it

5632.28 --> 5637.48
like if you try it'll like blow up it'll

5634.36 --> 5639.48
start melting it will be destroyed yeah

5637.48 --> 5644.36
that's how they're going to do it so

5639.48 --> 5646.4
that you must buy the new version again

5644.36 --> 5650.04
just like Apple has been doing for

5646.4 --> 5652.638999999999
decades now it will become so [ __ ]

5650.04 --> 5657.4
standardized and it will create more

5652.639 --> 5658.679
Industrial Waste than ever before also

5657.4 --> 5660.48
because all those cards are just going

5658.679 --> 5662.159
to be thrown

5660.48 --> 5663.759999999999
out

5662.159 --> 5665.92
and people aren't going to be able to

5663.76 --> 5669.2390000000005
recycle that that crap this all the new

5665.92 --> 5672.719
[ __ ] yeah and that's why older Parts

5669.239 --> 5672.718999999999
very valuable very

5690.48 --> 5693.48
useful

5695.239 --> 5697.48
about

5699.04 --> 5704.04
overclocking maybe that's part of

5709.199 --> 5714.879999999999
tuning but tuning is mostly setting the

5711.96 --> 5717.96
voltage setting the

5714.88 --> 5719.84
speed of processing the cycle process

5717.96 --> 5722.32
that kind of thing it's what you do in

5719.84 --> 5726.119000000001
the startup screen before your operating

5722.32 --> 5729.239
system loads that part has to be set has

5726.119 --> 5732.159
to be attuned it doesn't automatically

5729.239 --> 5734.638999999999
give you a reasonable setting

5732.159 --> 5737.96
anymore when you just installed a new

5734.639 --> 5741.0
computer you have to Now work on that or

5737.96 --> 5741.0
literally it will never

5741.4 --> 5746.638999999999
start with newer

5743.96 --> 5751.04
Parts because they're not default

5746.639 --> 5753.0
attuned to a good easy setting that will

5751.04 --> 5756.159
always work and will make your computer

5753.0 --> 5759.159
start up they just don't do that

5756.159 --> 5760.799999999999
anymore so I've heard I'm not going to

5759.159 --> 5763.239
try I'm not going to buy any new

5760.8 --> 5763.2390000000005
freaking

5768.239 --> 5772.759999999999
parts so I hope that clarifies

5780.32 --> 5783.32
it

5786.48 --> 5788.678999999999
all

5810.28 --> 5813.28
right

5816.8 --> 5820.679
okay we going to take a two minute break

5818.08 --> 5820.679
I'll be right

5840.199 --> 5843.199
back

5930.119 --> 5933.119
there

5941.76 --> 5944.320000000001
and I'm

5958.719 --> 5964.36
back would it feel rless

5962.0 --> 5968.4
some

5964.36 --> 5968.4
okay how did you assemble

5974.28 --> 5979.5599999999995
it okay well maybe you just got lucky

5976.8 --> 5982.4800000000005
with that then return of the mac and who

5979.56 --> 5985.360000000001
knows I

5982.48 --> 5987.44
mean there's like guys out there that

5985.36 --> 5991.119
like it's their profession to figure out

5987.44 --> 5993.36
how to assemble computer parts and their

5991.119 --> 5996.36
might be certain setups it's how I made

5993.36 --> 5999.199
my computer setup where they just know

5996.36 --> 6002.239
if you put these very specific Parts

5999.199 --> 6003.879999999999
together it will always work optimal

6002.239 --> 6006.5199999999995
like they're best attuned with each

6003.88 --> 6009.159000000001
other I use it through tweakers.net

6006.52 --> 6011.679
that's why they do

6009.159 --> 6014.719
that that's how I assemble my computers

6011.679 --> 6017.52
based on their models I have to get

6014.719 --> 6020.4
those parts and then it will absolutely

6017.52 --> 6023.040000000001
work and if you did that too then yeah

6020.4 --> 6025.879999999999
you then you can actually assemble that

6023.04 --> 6031.199
computer put it together and you can

6025.88 --> 6034.1990000000005
make it work without almost no tuning at

6031.199 --> 6034.199
all

6040.08 --> 6044.639
so you are the greatest

6046.84 --> 6052.92
okay uh if you say so Amanda

6053.52 --> 6061.4800000000005
you're getting hung up on the

6056.88 --> 6061.4800000000005
word whatever I'm not getting hung up on

6079.84 --> 6082.84
it

6088.159 --> 6095.799999999999
anyhow yeah computers it's it's

6091.599 --> 6095.8
cute my computer works just

6107.32 --> 6112.84
fine it's been doing great today

6137.199 --> 6141.48
okay well return up the Mac I don't

6139.44 --> 6143.44
really care which one of you is better

6141.48 --> 6146.638999999999
with

6143.44 --> 6149.28
computers share General

6146.639 --> 6151.400000000001
insights if you want to do it your way

6149.28 --> 6154.119
and it works that's great man you do it

6151.4 --> 6154.119
your way and it

6169.76 --> 6172.76
works

6190.71 --> 6193.869
[Applause]

6199.679 --> 6202.679
for

6229.679 --> 6232.679
that

6259.599 --> 6262.599
for

6263.04 --> 6266.109
[Applause]

6271.56 --> 6276.599
right so got a title I mean it is a

6274.0 --> 6279.199
thing I haven't like really talked about

6276.599 --> 6281.0
it all show long or whatever but it is

6279.199 --> 6282.5199999999995
very much a thing that just recently

6281.0 --> 6286.88
happened it is

6282.52 --> 6286.88
relevant and it's really

6289.56 --> 6292.56
insane

6299.96 --> 6305.76
all right been going hour 43 minutes

6319.48 --> 6322.48
cool

6334.119 --> 6339.08
coming back any luck what what do you

6349.48 --> 6352.48
mean

6358.52 --> 6363.360000000001
yeah ter I know I'm not expecting Nathan

6361.36 --> 6366.96
to pay it all out of

6363.36 --> 6369.28
pocket it's crazy he doesn't have that I

6366.96 --> 6369.28
know

6378.04 --> 6383.28
that but I mean in that sense it's not

6381.159 --> 6385.4
really up to Nathan it's up

6383.28 --> 6388.199
to his

6385.4 --> 6391.679
viewers to determine if they find it

6388.199 --> 6395.04
worth me being part of their show or

6391.679 --> 6398.119
not yeah and in that sense it's a vote

6395.04 --> 6401.96
so if it Li if it doesn't if there's no

6398.119 --> 6405.0
500 in there that means I'm I'm gone

6401.96 --> 6407.76
it's that simple it's like a votes like

6405.0 --> 6410.36
oh you want me to be part of that

6407.76 --> 6412.92
show well then fill it up otherwise it's

6410.36 --> 6412.92
it's not going to

6414.159 --> 6421.879999999999
happen it's that simple and like 10 20

6419.36 --> 6424.759999999999
bucks it doesn't matter

6421.88 --> 6428.08
500 and until that time I'm not going to

6424.76 --> 6430.159000000001
come back so they'll all just have to

6428.08 --> 6433.119
figure it out amongst themselves on how

6430.159 --> 6433.119
they're going to achieve

6439.32 --> 6442.32
that

6448.08 --> 6451.119
another FD I'm

6452.28 --> 6459.599
not I don't know

6455.119 --> 6462.0
teret I'm not exp expecting my friends

6459.599 --> 6464.719
on the panel and all that to do that and

6462.0 --> 6467.36
not it's it's the followers it's

6464.719 --> 6469.04
literally like hey Nathan gets income

6467.36 --> 6470.92
from all these people that like to see

6469.04 --> 6473.92
him do what he does right

6470.92 --> 6478.679
now it's up to them do you want to see

6473.92 --> 6482.28
Arwin remain a part of that show or

6478.679 --> 6486.719
not that's it not expecting any

6482.28 --> 6489.36
panelists to throw money in there at all

6486.719 --> 6492.119
I'm expecting them to make it abundantly

6489.36 --> 6494.639
clear to the audience that if you want

6492.119 --> 6496.36
Arwin back that that gifts and go has

6494.639 --> 6499.2390000000005
got to be

6496.36 --> 6500.88
filled that is

6499.239 --> 6503.678999999999
it

6500.88 --> 6506.52
right and it might not become filled

6503.679 --> 6509.4
right and hey if the guys in the panel

6506.52 --> 6512.56
just are like [ __ ] this we want my I

6509.4 --> 6517.0
want my damn rwi back then they might

6512.56 --> 6520.400000000001
pay it I don't know I can't be ar I'm

6517.0 --> 6524.84
done worrying about it it's a problem

6520.4 --> 6524.839999999999
this is the solution I'm moving

6529.199 --> 6534.96
on

6532.0 --> 6534.96
oh yeah thank you

6543.719 --> 6546.719
tet

6548.52 --> 6552.92
H computer components are comp yes

6551.599 --> 6555.92
return the Mac

6552.92 --> 6558.639
that's I well my dad never taught me

6555.92 --> 6561.4800000000005
anything about computers my brother did

6558.639 --> 6563.599
a little bit but not so much about

6561.48 --> 6566.4
computer assembly I had to kind of like

6563.599 --> 6566.400000000001
figure that out

6568.96 --> 6576.639
myself I mean when I started with a PC

6572.239 --> 6580.0
it was like barely

6576.639 --> 6583.32
computer in all that time so much has

6580.0 --> 6585.32
changed like so the quality and like

6583.32 --> 6588.239
even the compatibility of the parts have

6585.32 --> 6591.799999999999
all dramatically improved the internet

6588.239 --> 6593.759999999999
became standard and everything

6591.8 --> 6596.1990000000005
can you imagine that a time where you

6593.76 --> 6598.1990000000005
literally have to make your computer run

6596.199 --> 6602.4
without having access to the internet

6598.199 --> 6606.199
for updates and all that

6602.4 --> 6609.199
yeah there was a time when that was like

6606.199 --> 6613.32
that you don't just download the updates

6609.199 --> 6613.32
you need you have to figure it

6614.56 --> 6622.04
out yeah well that's all in the

6619.04 --> 6622.04
past

6623.04 --> 6628.84
DD is giving me yeah DD is great I love

6626.0 --> 6633.88
Divergent Droid a lot of I love a lot of

6628.84 --> 6633.88
the guys there and I miss

6633.96 --> 6641.719
them but it's it's

6638.28 --> 6645.239
done I can't let my

6641.719 --> 6649.04
sympathy make me do anything in that

6645.239 --> 6652.678999999999
sense this problem has to be solved

6649.04 --> 6653.76
and sympathy be damned until that time

6652.679 --> 6657.52
I'm just

6653.76 --> 6657.52
done I can't do this

6673.76 --> 6677.88
anymore show with clutch with yeah I

6676.119 --> 6678.96
loved it I really hope clutch is g to

6677.88 --> 6680.52
like

6678.96 --> 6682.88
really

6680.52 --> 6682.88
get

6684.48 --> 6690.199
back you were there only yesterday

6688.199 --> 6693.04
yeah yeah

6690.199 --> 6694.799999999999
well they're like in a way family yeah

6693.04 --> 6699.88
that's what happens when you're with

6694.8 --> 6702.76
them roughly 4 to eight hours every day

6699.88 --> 6706.52
for a decade yeah you start to miss them

6702.76 --> 6706.52
even after one damn day that's

6708.28 --> 6714.0
right Neil let's try oh I'm sure he is

6712.36 --> 6719.4
[ __ ]

6714.0 --> 6722.199
Neil [ __ ] him yeah you can now become

6719.4 --> 6725.0
subject you you can just take that yeah

6722.199 --> 6726.759999999999
Neil you're so much better in in your

6725.0 --> 6728.88
impromptu

6726.76 --> 6731.320000000001
interruptions with with comments that

6728.88 --> 6734.1990000000005
are like really below level of the

6731.32 --> 6737.079
conversation you can all go and do that

6734.199 --> 6740.678999999999
my interruptions aren't below level

6737.079 --> 6743.0
ever and they're funny

6740.679 --> 6744.76
and I don't deserve to be treated like a

6743.0 --> 6748.239
dog if

6744.76 --> 6750.8
Neil wants to take that role now all for

6748.239 --> 6753.44
himself go ahead it's going to be more

6750.8 --> 6753.4400000000005
cranky than

6766.88 --> 6773.079
ever yeah I know Richard G so Neil can

6770.56 --> 6773.079000000001
go [ __ ]

6782.28 --> 6787.719
himself it looks bad it looks bad yeah

6785.239 --> 6789.839999999999
[ __ ] the looking yeah how about go [ __ ]

6787.719 --> 6792.52
it [ __ ] the way we look how about you

6789.84 --> 6795.52
just be goddamn honest about things how

6792.52 --> 6799.92
about you de prioritize trying to throw

6795.52 --> 6802.88
an image in the oh maybe we could like

6799.92 --> 6805.679
snare more people getting them really

6802.88 --> 6807.92
comfortable to pay us money yeah why

6805.679 --> 6810.96
instead of that just why did you just be

6807.92 --> 6813.32
freaking straightforward and honest how

6810.96 --> 6813.32
about

6820.92 --> 6826.639
that yeah I am honest I'm saying exactly

6824.36 --> 6829.92
what I think and feel at all times even

6826.639 --> 6832.76
if that's completely detrimental to to

6829.92 --> 6835.56
any kind of social scenario that's there

6832.76 --> 6838.76
like I don't [ __ ] care it's not my

6835.56 --> 6842.079000000001
[ __ ] problem if somebody looks

6838.76 --> 6845.56
bad even if that somebody is me I don't

6842.079 --> 6845.5599999999995
care I'm going to be

6852.0 --> 6861.679
honest you just spend 500 on the pillow

6856.52 --> 6861.679
okay hey oh it's your issue yeah

6870.079 --> 6875.84
I guess you're not one of those guys

6871.599 --> 6875.84
that want to see me back on fed

6875.96 --> 6884.0
then right so very happy about your

6880.52 --> 6886.4400000000005
pillow that's really

6884.0 --> 6888.679
cool is there any reason why you're in

6886.44 --> 6891.678999999999
my chat right

6888.679 --> 6891.679
now

6909.28 --> 6914.48
trying flame yeah exactly I

6915.079 --> 6920.0
know best to ignore it yeah I would

6917.56 --> 6922.639
normally but I mean I directly interact

6920.0 --> 6925.96
with the chat

6922.639 --> 6928.719
so fed they don't care because the

6925.96 --> 6932.0
chat's not really being addressed unless

6928.719 --> 6934.159
that's somebody wants to so it doesn't

6932.0 --> 6936.52
really matter what happened in there

6934.159 --> 6938.32
over here I actually do address the chat

6936.52 --> 6943.52
and that sometimes that

6938.32 --> 6947.159
means an an alleged troll somebody that

6943.52 --> 6949.040000000001
does a high chance of being a troll I

6947.159 --> 6952.199
will still address it sometimes unless

6949.04 --> 6955.36
it's just [ __ ] whining and gross but

6952.199 --> 6958.678999999999
I mean I always love to like show people

6955.36 --> 6961.839999999999
like trying to brag about being like

6958.679 --> 6963.88
rich and and completely antisocial it's

6961.84 --> 6965.159000000001
always funny to see that they think that

6963.88 --> 6969.679
they're

6965.159 --> 6969.679
like winning somehow doing

6974.28 --> 6980.599
that I can do much better cool yeah well

6978.8 --> 6982.96
I hope to do much better because I'm

6980.599 --> 6987.159000000001
just doing my show

6982.96 --> 6987.159
now yeah he's mention

6988.44 --> 6992.4
whatever of course

6997.96 --> 7003.96
whatever I'm not I'm doing my own show

7000.88 --> 7008.4800000000005
here I'm not being a parallel

7003.96 --> 7012.32
show I'm not having fed open in another

7008.48 --> 7012.32
window I'm sticking to my

7013.04 --> 7018.44
show did Oakley ever pay me for re are

7016.599 --> 7019.96
you talking relative density

7018.44 --> 7022.44
disequilibrium

7019.96 --> 7025.52
rdd did he ever pay me for that why the

7022.44 --> 7025.5199999999995
hell would he pay me for

7026.159 --> 7034.079
that and besides it's

7028.8 --> 7038.2390000000005
like that's a join effort

7034.079 --> 7041.719
between uh sleeping Warrior and me like

7038.239 --> 7041.718999999999
we both kind of work that

7063.56 --> 7071.400000000001
out 500 for a pillow yeah maybe it's

7068.4 --> 7071.4
like

7072.719 --> 7076.719
maybe it's filled with feathers from the

7074.679 --> 7079.1990000000005
Golden Goose seeking star water maybe

7076.719 --> 7079.199
that kind of

7098.32 --> 7101.32
pillow

7112.84 --> 7119.4800000000005
yeah Tera don't

7115.76 --> 7122.8
don't got to be a special

7119.48 --> 7122.799999999999
what talking

7128.32 --> 7131.32
about

7139.4 --> 7143.719
so about yesterday's topic can we

7141.239 --> 7147.079
continue

7143.719 --> 7147.079
maybe I'm not

7149.159 --> 7156.239
sure I mean the chat's not

7152.48 --> 7158.119
really attuned to that right now but I

7156.239 --> 7160.119
mean if there's something really

7158.119 --> 7162.239
specific you wanted share me and it

7160.119 --> 7166.48
happens to be very interesting then

7162.239 --> 7166.48
maybe that will just shift

7188.239 --> 7191.239
it

7218.159 --> 7221.159
okay

7223.56 --> 7227.92
rule okay that's interesting turret yeah

7225.44 --> 7231.079
now I definitely want to know about it's

7227.92 --> 7234.159
like it might not be the right moment

7231.079 --> 7237.36
though but it is interesting I I am

7234.159 --> 7239.638999999999
interested I am also kind of

7237.36 --> 7241.759999999999
interested I almost want to do it like

7239.639 --> 7243.2390000000005
on camera with you but I want to discuss

7241.76 --> 7246.88
some of these

7243.239 --> 7250.44
issues in India with the

7246.88 --> 7252.4800000000005
religion because

7250.44 --> 7257.28
well let's just say Owen Benjamin

7252.48 --> 7257.28
Unearthed a whole bunch of really freaky

7258.28 --> 7264.759999999999
stuff and that stuff is like really

7260.92 --> 7264.76
persistent that stuff that's been

7264.92 --> 7271.84
like it's being worked on by

7269.28 --> 7277.079
modernists

7271.84 --> 7281.32
while people in it just keep doing those

7277.079 --> 7285.44
really crazy things or thousands of

7281.32 --> 7288.92
years and I since you have admitted to

7285.44 --> 7291.638999999999
be like a h a Hindu yourself right I

7288.92 --> 7293.8
just kind of want to know what are your

7291.639 --> 7297.92
view on all

7293.8 --> 7301.1990000000005
that I mean it what is your position

7297.92 --> 7303.96
because it's there's some real dark

7301.199 --> 7307.36
stuff in

7303.96 --> 7309.4800000000005
it in many ways it's just that I don't

7307.36 --> 7311.92
want to insult you but I kind of really

7309.48 --> 7314.759999999999
want to talk about that but it'll

7311.92 --> 7317.88
probably be very uncomfortable for

7314.76 --> 7320.2390000000005
you cuz I want to in ways test like

7317.88 --> 7324.0
where your position is within your

7320.239 --> 7327.119
religion because there's just some real

7324.0 --> 7330.239
real dark issues there

7327.119 --> 7334.48
too and I kind of want to

7330.239 --> 7334.48
know where you're standing in

7337.96 --> 7342.4
there

7339.84 --> 7347.360000000001
ptic stories might sound and now not

7342.4 --> 7351.4
just that some of them are just straight

7347.36 --> 7353.88
out idiotic and Madness

7351.4 --> 7355.96
inducing there's Parts in like the

7353.88 --> 7360.4400000000005
stories that are recognized from that

7355.96 --> 7365.36
movie too that are just so stupid it's

7360.44 --> 7367.799999999999
like it's leading you down a Fantastical

7365.36 --> 7370.88
wrong path on purpose it's like

7367.8 --> 7372.8
purposeful idiot

7370.88 --> 7375.76
that they roll out in those stories and

7372.8 --> 7378.079000000001
it is like that is like

7375.76 --> 7380.280000000001
evil I think that a lot of the old

7378.079 --> 7383.4
priests were actually really [ __ ]

7380.28 --> 7385.719
evil in reality and that doesn't mean

7383.4 --> 7387.28
that the things that you do and you've

7385.719 --> 7391.8
learned aren't

7387.28 --> 7391.8
real there's a lot of super old

7392.119 --> 7400.04
knowledge but my

7395.32 --> 7403.5199999999995
God there's like really evil things in

7400.04 --> 7406.36
there like you I can see it just the way

7403.52 --> 7409.719
the information is the way the story is

7406.36 --> 7413.199
it's like that's not meant to inform you

7409.719 --> 7416.52
that's there to literally erase your

7413.199 --> 7416.5199999999995
mind it's

7420.96 --> 7424.32
creepy Mis

7427.679 --> 7434.04
transations May maybe but I mean mations

7432.04 --> 7437.88
perhaps but there's

7434.04 --> 7441.599
people in your nation that do all of

7437.88 --> 7445.119
those things though still they still do

7441.599 --> 7448.719
that so that mistranslation has

7445.119 --> 7450.96
been latched on to like forever I don't

7448.719 --> 7454.36
think that's all mistranslations I don't

7450.96 --> 7454.36
think so you can't blame this on a

7455.079 --> 7459.5199999999995
mistranslation it's just there's

7457.4 --> 7461.598999999999
something really and it's not like oh

7459.52 --> 7462.639
they're the devil no there's something

7461.599 --> 7467.4800000000005
really

7462.639 --> 7469.400000000001
weird something ancient and

7467.48 --> 7472.879999999999
surreal about

7469.4 --> 7474.96
it about some of these things and like

7472.88 --> 7480.079
how the stories are

7474.96 --> 7480.079
assembled it's really really

7481.239 --> 7487.04
weird and like you can compare it you

7485.159 --> 7489.5199999999995
can compare it to like other religious

7487.04 --> 7491.76
stories and even panthe antics

7489.52 --> 7494.639
Pantheon stories but then when you look

7491.76 --> 7498.4800000000005
at like the the oldest arguably oldest

7494.639 --> 7498.4800000000005
version like that

7499.719 --> 7505.119
story mislead

7502.4 --> 7506.799999999999
you like the story the fantasical

7505.119 --> 7509.199
stories

7506.8 --> 7513.639
mislead it

7509.199 --> 7513.638999999999
misinforms about how things

7517.679 --> 7520.679
work

7524.639 --> 7526.92
it's

7531.44 --> 7537.96
bizarre confusion amongst modern oh but

7535.199 --> 7540.96
there's must be like a in an

7537.96 --> 7544.119
introspective crisis in a in a

7540.96 --> 7545.44
way within India especially now that

7544.119 --> 7547.679
they've like engaged with the moon

7545.44 --> 7552.0
landing it's like

7547.679 --> 7554.719
from crazy archaic disgusting habits to

7552.0 --> 7557.599
oh but we're modern our own we we faked

7554.719 --> 7561.0
our own moon landing like it's kind of

7557.599 --> 7561.0
that situation you

7561.159 --> 7565.679
know I'm just trying to figure out like

7563.96 --> 7568.76
what is all that

7565.679 --> 7571.159
like there are you could definitely look

7568.76 --> 7575.079000000001
at a lot of what's happening in India

7571.159 --> 7579.44
from a Christian perspective and really

7575.079 --> 7581.599
really feel like that is like straight

7579.44 --> 7584.159
out satanic in ways like that's how

7581.599 --> 7586.28
that's regarded over here that's when

7584.159 --> 7589.239
people do that that is regarded as

7586.28 --> 7593.559
satanic and it's really bizarre how that

7589.239 --> 7599.44
is like been in a religion for thousands

7593.559 --> 7599.4400000000005
of years that is truly surreal to

7600.599 --> 7606.599
me you're highly INSP specific to me

7603.84 --> 7609.4800000000005
well it's gross I don't really want

7606.599 --> 7612.639
to shove it in your face like it's just

7609.48 --> 7614.5199999999995
Owen Benjamin's talking about it a

7612.639 --> 7619.119
lot it's

7614.52 --> 7623.1990000000005
that freaking crazy idea within like oh

7619.119 --> 7626.04
there's all these gods in the cow and

7623.199 --> 7630.199
like their [ __ ] is literally holy and

7626.04 --> 7633.36
all that and how far they take it not

7630.199 --> 7633.36
what the [ __ ] are you talking

7633.559 --> 7640.52
about I put a word like that in my chat

7636.719 --> 7640.52
what the hell

7649.559 --> 7656.0
wear orange no wearing a color is not

7653.159 --> 7659.759999999999
satanic is what you

7656.0 --> 7663.84
do and where your spiritual insight and

7659.76 --> 7666.04
position is like how much do you realize

7663.84 --> 7669.719
that matter is only matter and that the

7666.04 --> 7673.28
spirit is separate and more

7669.719 --> 7676.199
important because from that perspective

7673.28 --> 7679.5199999999995
like a lot of this Hindu stuff

7676.199 --> 7684.04
especially with all the poo and all that

7679.52 --> 7688.719
that's literally a deification of matter

7684.04 --> 7688.719
itself through some weird

7691.199 --> 7697.0
claims worshipping

7695.04 --> 7700.44
dirt

7697.0 --> 7700.44
it's crazy

7701.199 --> 7706.919999999999
right but I don't want to like I'm I'm

7704.679 --> 7710.36
wanting to be very careful

7706.92 --> 7713.159
because know you're on that I don't want

7710.36 --> 7716.28
to like insult you directly but it's

7713.159 --> 7719.44
like there's issues man and like I want

7716.28 --> 7722.119
it to be fixed man I want it to be fixed

7719.44 --> 7722.119
for you

7727.4 --> 7730.638999999999
guys

7729.04 --> 7733.159
and I think there's plenty of people in

7730.639 --> 7736.119
India that kind of want it fixed as

7733.159 --> 7739.119
well because they're sick of it they're

7736.119 --> 7739.119
sick of the crazy

7743.04 --> 7747.88
people maybe you

7745.079 --> 7750.92
could tell me that rule

7747.88 --> 7753.28
now me okay

7750.92 --> 7756.079
sure if you want to move on that's fine

7753.28 --> 7756.079
a little flatten and

7757.32 --> 7760.32
stationary

7782.04 --> 7787.32
AR portion of Indians with Orange Beards

7785.52 --> 7790.320000000001
what

7787.32 --> 7790.32
okay

7792.4 --> 7799.839999999999
it's kind of

7794.639 --> 7799.84
weird because wasn't like

7800.48 --> 7807.32
Muhammad from Islam wasn't he like said

7803.96 --> 7809.559
to have like orange orange hair I don't

7807.32 --> 7813.119
know if that was colored or if it was

7809.559 --> 7817.2390000000005
his own hair color but that's kind of

7813.119 --> 7820.239
weird like why would the Indians do

7817.239 --> 7820.239
that

7825.559 --> 7828.159000000001
are you still

7847.239 --> 7850.239
there

7865.92 --> 7872.639
Indians eat that obviously no then why

7869.719 --> 7875.599
is there so much footage of it of them

7872.639 --> 7875.599
literally doing

7877.159 --> 7880.159
that

7883.599 --> 7889.0
why are there companies that literally

7885.88 --> 7891.4800000000005
export it to

7889.0 --> 7896.8
Canada like skin

7891.48 --> 7896.799999999999
cream and bragging about it

7898.48 --> 7905.718999999999
why like I'm not saying that you do it

7902.079 --> 7907.159
teret but it definitely seems like it is

7905.719 --> 7910.159
happening in

7907.159 --> 7910.159
India

7924.599 --> 7930.559
yeah so for the clarity not all Indians

7928.199 --> 7934.04
yeah I'm pretty damn sure not all

7930.559 --> 7937.04
Indians but it is like it is

7934.04 --> 7937.04
significantly

7937.079 --> 7940.079
present

7956.04 --> 7960.199
created this IM well I haven't created

7958.0 --> 7963.04
this image of India I just know what is

7960.199 --> 7967.239
there it is in there it's there for a

7963.04 --> 7969.679
long time I mean the government is like

7967.239 --> 7971.759999999999
has been trying trying to like how do we

7969.679 --> 7974.4800000000005
get the freaking people to stop doing

7971.76 --> 7978.400000000001
this for an eternity and it just

7974.48 --> 7978.4
wouldn't it won't work they keep doing

7982.4 --> 7987.119
it people here consume cow diary yeah

7985.52 --> 7989.4800000000005
yeah yeah that's the food what are you

7987.119 --> 7989.48
talking

7992.199 --> 7996.4
about well if you really want to know

7994.92 --> 7998.679
what I'm talking about just watch

7996.4 --> 8003.558999999999
freaking Owen Benjamin stream from the

7998.679 --> 8003.559
last two days you'll show you the

8012.639 --> 8018.719
videos that's right I don't want to I

8016.199 --> 8021.28
don't want to I'm not going to say all

8018.719 --> 8024.599
that crap out loud

8021.28 --> 8024.599
thanks it's

be proud of and

8235.8 --> 8240.679
worship like think that you're good or

8238.599 --> 8243.16
holy or even

8240.679 --> 8246.76
protected by doing something like that

8243.16 --> 8250.039999999999
which is an indecent act and should only

8246.76 --> 8250.04
take place in the

8252.96 --> 8257.479
shadows that's what's so messed up about

8266.599 --> 8269.599

8276.92 --> 8282.319
now it's still happening now not the

8283.28 --> 8286.92
past it's right

8290.399 --> 8296.399
there I mean I have heard or rather

8293.28 --> 8299.76
through Owen Benjamin that this new Modi

8296.399 --> 8302.96
guy has like really helps clean it up a

8299.76 --> 8302.960000000001
bit but it's still

8323.679 --> 8330.8
there sure countries have scat no

8327.639 --> 8330.8
nothing close to

8339.0 --> 8344.559
that yeah in our supposed medieval

8341.719 --> 8348.358999999999
period we never used poo as some kind of

8344.559 --> 8348.358999999999
holy remedy okay

8348.399 --> 8353.679
never now there were no proper sewers

8351.12 --> 8356.2
back then and it was a

8353.679 --> 8360.84
problem

8356.2 --> 8363.559000000001
right but we never woried it we never

8360.84 --> 8363.559
worshiped

8364.28 --> 8370.76
[ __ ] so no you can absolutely not

8367.28 --> 8370.76
compare that to us

8372.92 --> 8376.960000000001
ever hey LS G good see

8386.439 --> 8389.439
you

8408.8 --> 8415.96
[ __ ] what the [ __ ] I I have not seen

8412.479 --> 8419.358999999999
that stuff but I haven't even addressed

8415.96 --> 8419.358999999999
that there it

8427.439 --> 8433.2
I have not seen that though thank

8430.6 --> 8435.04
God now all that I seen is more than

8433.2 --> 8437.640000000001
enough that I've seen that's like watch

8435.04 --> 8440.479000000001
Owen Benjamin from the last two days

8437.64 --> 8443.8
that'll show you what I have seen about

8440.479 --> 8443.8
it and that's more than

8446.319 --> 8449.319
enough

8454.479 --> 8460.438999999998
right but yeah just what whatever you

8457.12 --> 8463.52
think man sorry for bringing it even up

8460.439 --> 8465.479000000001
although it is good to bring it up yeah

8463.52 --> 8468.399000000001
paj

8465.479 --> 8471.438999999998
terrible just know that I am not

8468.399 --> 8471.439
thinking of you like

8471.92 --> 8477.84
that I know you

8475.16 --> 8480.68
are not like that

8477.84 --> 8483.439
so don't worry I'm not going to talk to

8480.68 --> 8486.84
you like that

8483.439 --> 8489.16
ever but I am just puzzled about the

8486.84 --> 8489.16
whole

8506.04 --> 8511.399000000001
thing yeah that's right return to the

8508.359 --> 8515.359
Mac yeah because it is

8511.399 --> 8517.439
real that is real it's not fake you can

8515.359 --> 8522.12
think of it as fake it isn't fake it's

8517.439 --> 8522.12
real they really do that and

8523.52 --> 8528.12
hey your government could actually do

8526.92 --> 8530.92
something about

8528.12 --> 8533.160000000002
it it could make that

8530.92 --> 8534.92
illegal but then there would be a

8533.16 --> 8539.16
religious Revolution happening and

8534.92 --> 8539.16
that's the problem right

8548.439 --> 8553.76
think you yeah star is dreamy it it

8551.319 --> 8556.16
can't be helped right now it's it's what

8553.76 --> 8560.439
it is it's all over the place I don't

8556.16 --> 8560.439
really like talking about it too

8560.92 --> 8564.56
much if you know what I

8566.16 --> 8571.52
mean yeah shut up return up the max

8569.08 --> 8571.52

8596.08 --> 8599.08
funny

8602.72 --> 8607.24
right

8604.359 --> 8608.84
so but man I've been going 2 hours 20

8607.24 --> 8611.92
minutes already so I'm probably going to

8608.84 --> 8612.880000000001
run out the show soon but I kind of want

8611.92 --> 8615.64
to

8612.88 --> 8618.24
like maybe talk about something else and

8615.64 --> 8620.479
not leave it hanging on a shitty subject

8618.24 --> 8620.479
like

8626.08 --> 8629.08
that

8635.2 --> 8640.92
why hearing India that it doesn't it

8638.12 --> 8642.76
didn't teret did I bring that up

8640.92 --> 8647.359
immediately when you revealed to be

8642.76 --> 8648.960000000001
Indian do I ever no it's just being

8647.359 --> 8653.2
addressed

8648.96 --> 8655.64
now or as Owen calls it it's pajit

8653.2 --> 8657.84
week it's going to be addressed it's

8655.64 --> 8660.319
going to be on a lot of people mind get

8657.84 --> 8661.84
ready because you're just going to get

8660.319 --> 8664.96
those questions now because you're

8661.84 --> 8668.880000000001
Indian there's no way around

8664.96 --> 8671.72
it like we want to know why no more

8668.88 --> 8675.319
Illusions we want to know

8671.72 --> 8678.479
why what the [ __ ] is going on there and

8675.319 --> 8681.519999999999
why why is that happening why do people

8678.479 --> 8684.278999999999
deny it or approve

8681.52 --> 8686.6
it there's just something really weird

8684.279 --> 8691.76
about all of that it's like the only

8686.6 --> 8695.0
play in the entire world ter the only

8691.76 --> 8698.2
place in the world where that happens

8695.0 --> 8701.08
like that I mean they have some gross

8698.2 --> 8703.880000000001
habits in certain Africa regions but

8701.08 --> 8707.2
even they don't take it that far they

8703.88 --> 8708.56
don't freaking worship anything about it

8707.2 --> 8710.640000000001
it's not

8708.56 --> 8712.16
religious it's the only place in the

8710.64 --> 8714.439
world it's really

8712.16 --> 8715.96
freaky and it's being addressed right

8714.439 --> 8717.6
now there's nothing you could do to stop

8715.96 --> 8720.8
it it's

8717.6 --> 8720.800000000001
just go away

8726.72 --> 8734.438999999998
eventually my country is under sea

8729.8 --> 8734.438999999998
level don't understand

8740.72 --> 8745.88
yeah there's a billion people with

8743.0 --> 8748.279
adversity yeah and some of them are

8745.88 --> 8750.479
shitty

8748.279 --> 8752.279
and they are a part of you and they're

8750.479 --> 8755.119999999999
the only country in the world where that

8752.279 --> 8756.880000000001
happens and that's a fact and saying oh

8755.12 --> 8758.399000000001
it's really big yeah that doesn't take

8756.88 --> 8760.88
away that it's the only country in the

8758.399 --> 8764.16
world where that happens though doesn't

8760.88 --> 8764.16
matter how big your country

8775.8 --> 8781.8
is

8777.319 --> 8785.0
but yeah my country is under sea level

8781.8 --> 8788.679999999998
yeah they build dkes and then they

8785.0 --> 8789.68
laid dry the polers so that it can be

8788.68 --> 8793.319
made

8789.68 --> 8793.319
into farming

8793.8 --> 8801.92
land and the Dutch pretty much invented

8798.279 --> 8803.960000000001
that or are recorded in history to be

8801.92 --> 8808.0
the ones that have invented that I might

8803.96 --> 8812.479
have been done in the far past as well

8808.0 --> 8812.479
but not that is official

8820.279 --> 8827.04
anyway I saw European yeah well that's

8824.04 --> 8830.479000000001
not from Europeans that's from

8827.04 --> 8832.2
migrants that take it with them take

8830.479 --> 8833.96
those habits with there's no Europeans

8832.2 --> 8837.640000000001
that do that you never see a white

8833.96 --> 8840.88
person do that ever unless they're like

8837.64 --> 8843.24
crazy converts

8840.88 --> 8845.839999999998

9392.399 --> 9396.92
okay I don't even know what that stream

9394.92 --> 9399.0
is though so you're saying that they're

9396.92 --> 9403.12
talking about me why

9399.0 --> 9403.12
though like I'm not even part of

9403.6 --> 9407.880000000001
it I've never even visited that

9434.8 --> 9437.8
chat

9440.2 --> 9444.68
communities fracturing and splintering

9442.0 --> 9447.64
yeah that that's how they extinguish us

9444.68 --> 9449.68
right get all choked and choked until

9447.64 --> 9451.599999999999
everybody's a [ __ ] demonic liar

9449.68 --> 9454.04
nobody cares anymore the only one that

9451.6 --> 9456.0
follows you are a bunch of bots then

9454.04 --> 9458.319000000001
they cut the bots off and then you're

9456.0 --> 9460.76
all alone and you and you drop it and

9458.319 --> 9463.039999999999
then we all go away that's the tactic

9460.76 --> 9465.479
that's how they get Flat Earth out they

9463.04 --> 9467.84
just leave your money create infighting

9465.479 --> 9470.56
and then then there's nothing left and

9467.84 --> 9470.56
we all just

9484.24 --> 9490.0
leave there crap in in virtually all

9487.96 --> 9492.919999999998
communities yeah but what are those

9490.0 --> 9492.92
communities even

9493.88 --> 9500.599999999999
do this is a tech

9497.0 --> 9503.479
yeah YouTube just wants they want the

9500.6 --> 9506.76
people out of the YouTube they just want

9503.479 --> 9509.72
people that act like complete robots do

9506.76 --> 9511.399
the latest thing to the maximum level

9509.72 --> 9513.76
even if they have to kill themselves in

9511.399 --> 9516.84
the process that's what they want

9513.76 --> 9520.08
everybody else they just want them

9516.84 --> 9523.6
out they don't want any more real people

9520.08 --> 9526.72
here they want to choke them out so that

9523.6 --> 9530.279
it can be one gigantic autom

9526.72 --> 9530.278999999999
robot that's what they

9554.64 --> 9557.64
want

9581.279 --> 9584.52
ah think they in we

9584.64 --> 9588.519999999999
place

9586.359 --> 9590.56
the door right yeah somebody fixed the

9588.52 --> 9593.16
window but they fixed it by

9590.56 --> 9594.92
literally taking the door out and then

9593.16 --> 9596.8
fixing it somewhere else and

9594.92 --> 9598.439
reinstalling

9596.8 --> 9602.24
it

9598.439 --> 9606.12
anyway ra Jo is too real for yeah yeah

9602.24 --> 9606.119999999999
yeah to of course

9614.56 --> 9617.56
terrifying

9618.359 --> 9624.76
no sorry got to be some

9621.2 --> 9628.479000000001
noise not going to take long

9624.76 --> 9630.52
though a lot of people feel like I do

9628.479 --> 9633.16
well that's what I kind of hope on

9630.52 --> 9636.0
that's why I'm doing that I'm showing

9633.16 --> 9638.16
that end result of what's going to be

9636.0 --> 9641.319
inevitable because nothing else is going

9638.16 --> 9644.119999999999
to happen in between so in the end it's

9641.319 --> 9646.76
rage win in all people that is going to

9644.12 --> 9648.720000000001
end this you're just going to have to

9646.76 --> 9652.399
roughly get there which means you have

9648.72 --> 9653.479
to lose absolutely every [ __ ] thing

9652.399 --> 9656.319
you ever

9653.479 --> 9658.438999999998
loved everything in everything

9656.319 --> 9661.68
everything you enjoyed in everything you

9658.439 --> 9665.68
do is going to be lost because people

9661.68 --> 9669.720000000001
don't do anything until they lost

9665.68 --> 9669.720000000001
everything so that's what's going to

9673.12 --> 9677.439
happen yeah

9678.56 --> 9684.199999999999
because people are just going

9680.399 --> 9688.358999999999
to like oh but not

9684.2 --> 9691.560000000001
now maybe when like actual 50% of all

9688.359 --> 9694.640000000001
the entire world's population is dead

9691.56 --> 9698.76
like very apparent not just by Word of

9694.64 --> 9701.72
Mouth maybe then people will be like huh

9698.76 --> 9703.76
maybe we should try to do something

9701.72 --> 9706.76
another 25% of the entire world

9703.76 --> 9708.2
population dead hm yeah we should really

9706.76 --> 9711.08
do something and then when there's like

9708.2 --> 9714.16
1% left then like we're going to do it

9711.08 --> 9717.84
right now yeah because that's how it

9714.16 --> 9720.8
works everybody is going to die and

9717.84 --> 9722.76
everybody will let it happen until the

9720.8 --> 9726.56
majority is

9722.76 --> 9731.04
dead and that is how it is going to be

9726.56 --> 9733.399
nobody is going to do anything until the

9731.04 --> 9734.92
majority is dead they're all going to

9733.399 --> 9736.8
hype about they're all going to warn

9734.92 --> 9739.2
everybody about it going to make you

9736.8 --> 9741.64
stressed out going to try to make you do

9739.2 --> 9743.84
things and you're going to do it in in a

9741.64 --> 9746.278999999999
vain attempt to stop it because nothing

9743.84 --> 9748.68
is going to stop it until the majority

9746.279 --> 9751.2
of people are dead because the majority

9748.68 --> 9753.439
of people are not going to stop the

9751.2 --> 9755.880000000001
majority of people from dying they're

9753.439 --> 9756.92
just going to sit there and do nothing

9755.88 --> 9760.599999999999
and

9756.92 --> 9763.319
wait until everybody's dead that's what

9760.6 --> 9763.319
people are going to

9764.359 --> 9770.08
do

9766.8 --> 9771.599999999999
right just like my Dutch missionary

9770.08 --> 9775.2
cabinet

9771.6 --> 9777.56
just we had to find out through news

9775.2 --> 9779.76
reports that apparently the the

9777.56 --> 9783.24
Netherlands just helped the coalition to

9779.76 --> 9786.279
bomb another country yeah we had to the

9783.24 --> 9787.399
parliament here had to find out through

9786.279 --> 9791.399000000001
the

9787.399 --> 9795.519999999999
news that that happened yeah it's going

9791.399 --> 9798.119999999999
to keep happening more of that just more

9795.52 --> 9801.52
it's like yeah [ __ ] you people you're

9798.12 --> 9805.279
here to die you're here to [ __ ] kill

9801.52 --> 9808.880000000001
yourself we own you you are our cattle

9805.279 --> 9812.16
slaves and when we tell you to die you

9808.88 --> 9814.24
die you don't have a say you don't get

9812.16 --> 9816.72
to elect anything and you don't get to

9814.24 --> 9819.6
determine what you are go what we are

9816.72 --> 9822.199999999999
going to do in your name cuz you will do

9819.6 --> 9824.439
nothing until the majority of everybody

9822.2 --> 9828.359
in the [ __ ] world is dead and then

9824.439 --> 9830.880000000001
you might do something about it just

9828.359 --> 9833.16
like everybody

9830.88 --> 9835.759999999998
else and I understand now there's

9833.16 --> 9838.68
nothing going to stop it nobody is going

9835.76 --> 9841.04
to do [ __ ] until the vast majority of

9838.68 --> 9844.319
people in the world are

9841.04 --> 9847.52
dead and then you're going to do

9844.319 --> 9849.64
something when you've lost everything

9847.52 --> 9853.2
because that's the condition as long as

9849.64 --> 9856.84
people still have anything to hold on to

9853.2 --> 9859.720000000001
they will allow everything to be

9856.84 --> 9864.76
destroyed and that's the [ __ ] cold

9859.72 --> 9868.679999999998
heart facts that are immutable and

9864.76 --> 9872.359
unavoidable I understand that

9868.68 --> 9875.960000000001
now and I will keep rubbing that

9872.359 --> 9878.92
in we keep rubbing it in and rubbing it

9875.96 --> 9881.199999999999
in to remind everybody that that is

9878.92 --> 9884.52
exactly how it

9881.2 --> 9887.479000000001
is yeah every [ __ ] person in the

9884.52 --> 9889.84
world you can have your little luxury

9887.479 --> 9893.64
empathy inside of you but you're not

9889.84 --> 9896.319
going to do anything until the majority

9893.64 --> 9899.88
of people in this world are dead because

9896.319 --> 9901.119999999999
of the evil and you no longer have

9899.88 --> 9904.199999999999
anything to

9901.12 --> 9905.76
lose you're going to watch as everything

9904.2 --> 9909.52
crumbles around you and you're going to

9905.76 --> 9911.92
do absolutely nothing to stop it you

9909.52 --> 9914.84
will virtual signal to

9911.92 --> 9918.56
yourself pretending like you're helping

9914.84 --> 9920.56
to stop it when you are not cuz just

9918.56 --> 9923.8
like everybody else you're going to all

9920.56 --> 9927.08
just let it happen and let the majority

9923.8 --> 9930.599999999999
of people in this world die because of

9927.08 --> 9934.56
it and you will do nothing because you

9930.6 --> 9937.52
still have something to hold on to as an

9934.56 --> 9940.0
excuse to do nothing so you're going to

9937.52 --> 9940.0
lose it

9944.08 --> 9947.72
all

9945.92 --> 9952.24
and I have no more

9947.72 --> 9955.16
sympathy I'm like yeah lose it all lose

9952.24 --> 9957.6
it all all of it everything everything

9955.16 --> 9959.319
that ever was that we thought we had

9957.6 --> 9960.960000000001
you're going to lose it all everybody's

9959.319 --> 9963.119999999999
going to lose it all you will have

9960.96 --> 9965.479
absolutely nothing and you won't be

9963.12 --> 9969.160000000002
happy you'll probably [ __ ] kill

9965.479 --> 9971.278999999999
yourself cuz you're [ __ ] weak all of

9969.16 --> 9974.039999999999
you were weak none of you deserve

9971.279 --> 9977.0
anything you don't deserve ownership of

9974.04 --> 9977.0
anything

9977.2 --> 9984.240000000002
yeah cuz you are cattle because you're

9980.16 --> 9987.279
treated like cattle and you don't get

9984.24 --> 9990.439
out of that position so you accept

9987.279 --> 9992.6
cattle Hood and the price that comes

9990.439 --> 9992.6
with

10002.64 --> 10009.16
it if you're not cattle

10005.68 --> 10012.359
then be the revolution no Brotherhood no

10009.16 --> 10016.359
that means you have a knife and you

10012.359 --> 10019.399000000001
[ __ ] kill them you [ __ ] kill these

10016.359 --> 10021.399000000001
politicians you kill them you go to the

10019.399 --> 10023.64
right judges who you know are part of

10021.399 --> 10025.72
them and you kill them and you take

10023.64 --> 10027.96
everybody everybody out there yeah your

10025.72 --> 10029.679999999998
life is over it was is going to end

10027.96 --> 10030.919999999998
anyway and it's going to me absolutely

10029.68 --> 10033.08
nothing and you're going to die

10030.92 --> 10036.319
embarrassed anyway so you might just as

10033.08 --> 10039.56
well do this

10036.319 --> 10041.6
yeah while you still have enough energy

10039.56 --> 10044.72
left within your spirit to even be

10041.6 --> 10045.640000000001
capable of doing such a thing if you are

10044.72 --> 10049.92
at

10045.64 --> 10052.68

10107.439 --> 10112.64
happen yeah the Western World for the

10110.279 --> 10117.279
most Parts doesn't tolerate violence and

10129.6 --> 10132.960000000001
time and the

10133.04 --> 10139.04
judges out there they're allowing them
