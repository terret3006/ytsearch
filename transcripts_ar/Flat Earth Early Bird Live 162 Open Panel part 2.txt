267.44 --> 274.0
middle light goes out on this thing here

271.28 --> 278.83
once the mid light goes out on that

274.0 --> 281.81
there's nothing to do about it except

of course

340.84 --> 347.26
anyway and this totally caught off guard

344.8 --> 351.90000000000003
now because yeah I thought my hangout

347.26 --> 351.9
was over but apparently it's still going

362.559 --> 371.399
uh-oh no it did actually break off and

366.669 --> 371.399
start a new hangout goody

372.539 --> 381.279
it was down for a pretty long time so

375.909 --> 388.079
okay this is the second stream hello

381.279 --> 388.079
Karen be ute Fe diplomat

401.599 --> 406.56
right righteous force well I'm the only

404.129 --> 409.319
one in this household that is using this

406.56 --> 415.5
power line so I don't have any trouble

409.319 --> 418.56
with that it's just it it just glitches

415.5 --> 420.72
sometimes and it's look if you can just

418.56 --> 422.909
normally reach it that's no problem at

420.72 --> 426.03000000000003
all you yeah it's like turning it off

422.909 --> 429.419
and on again that's it and it keeps on

426.03 --> 433.19
working after that it rarely gives

429.419 --> 433.19
glitches or errors all the time

433.22 --> 438.59900000000005
sometimes just just these fits that just

437.13 --> 442.199
the whole day it's just screwing around

438.599 --> 443.819
but that's it that's on the rare

442.199 --> 447.27000000000004
occasion really I've been doing with

443.819 --> 450.81
these this internet connection since

447.27 --> 453.06
since I came and live here it's been my

450.81 --> 455.4
internet connection for five years it's

453.06 --> 458.12
working great considering the

455.4 --> 458.12
circumstances

462.49 --> 465.699
[Music]

471.94 --> 482.41
mm-hmm yeah it's weird I have a weird

479.9 --> 485.35999999999996
feeling like my voice changed somehow

482.41 --> 489.35
maybe it's because of the honey that I

485.36 --> 492.35
ate yesterday or the cold like I just

489.35 --> 495.74
get the feeling like my voice sounds

492.35 --> 497.57000000000005
slightly different than usual I don't

495.74 --> 502.43
know I'm gonna have to listen back and

497.57 --> 505.15999999999997
figure out if that's the case I do find

502.43 --> 507.77
myself sounding very annoying at times

505.16 --> 511.94
so with all those people out there that

507.77 --> 514.66
think I'm oh no not our win again always

511.94 --> 517.52
every day I kind of get it

514.66 --> 520.3399999999999
I'm just very lucky that there are still

517.52 --> 522.89
people out there that think it's okay

520.34 --> 526.5500000000001
and that can look perfectly past it or

522.89 --> 528.89
enough find what I do have to say

526.55 --> 531.41
interesting and it shouldn't always be

528.89 --> 533.18
so create critical of myself and

531.41 --> 535.43
shouldn't even be focusing on that

533.18 --> 539.2299999999999
really it's just I don't know I'm just

535.43 --> 539.2299999999999
trying to be honest

541.3 --> 548.8599999999999
yeah thanks buh-bum MacLeod Gator fish

552.04 --> 556.15
life is definitely flat

556.249 --> 564.1800000000001
yeah and what then what do you do then

558.779 --> 565.829
from that point on because it's the

564.18 --> 568.9989999999999
biggest thing about Flat Earth really

565.829 --> 573.93
when it comes to the psychology of it is

568.999 --> 577.7900000000001
that the ballers are used to having it

573.93 --> 581.7299999999999
all filled in for there to have been a

577.79 --> 584.819
model of how reality is that is so

581.73 --> 587.04
extensive and so perfected that there's

584.819 --> 592.399
no more usually tinkering on it unless

587.04 --> 592.399
you're a genius and calculus wizard and

593.029 --> 598.35
once you figure out wait there's things

595.559 --> 603.209
wrong with this and you're dared to step

598.35 --> 605.49
out of line against the crowd then

603.209 --> 607.949
suddenly if you can find a calm moment

605.49 --> 611.85
your start you might start to figure out

607.949 --> 615.6289999999999
like oh [ __ ] it's flat right but that

611.85 --> 617.9390000000001
leaves so much open that means wheelin

615.629 --> 623.399
oh so damn little there's so much still

617.939 --> 629.309
to figure out and a lot of people can't

623.399 --> 633.72
handle that because they're addicted

629.309 --> 637.11
they're used to the cultural illusion

633.72 --> 639.72
that they are modern and futurist and

637.11 --> 643.019
they are part of a crowd where you no

639.72 --> 645.0590000000001
longer really need to do a lot of things

643.019 --> 646.8
you can just be there to enjoy because

645.059 --> 648.689
the all societies all worked out

646.8 --> 651.7489999999999
everything is great there's still some

648.689 --> 657.209
problems but we're all at fast we know

651.749 --> 659.66
almost everything that's the illusion

657.209 --> 659.66
behind it

662.71 --> 671.57
and yeah people a lot of people can't

668.6 --> 675.71
get out of that and it's purely

671.57 --> 678.35
psychological and once that gets

675.71 --> 681.5
triggered that responds to prevent you

678.35 --> 683.6
from snapping out of that it's almost

681.5 --> 687.22
impossible to be honest about that as

683.6 --> 689.78
well it is just like how some people

687.22 --> 694.07
can't admit when they did something

689.78 --> 696.47
wrong you everybody in the life has

694.07 --> 698.45
probably known or met a person that has

696.47 --> 701.1800000000001
this type of issue there are just

698.45 --> 703.75
perfectly normal people but when they

701.18 --> 709.01
make a mistake or they said something

703.75 --> 712.16
that was just super out of place or

709.01 --> 714.64
wrong or just a huge mistake they'll

712.16 --> 717.1999999999999
just try to act like it doesn't exist

714.64 --> 719.24
because they can't admit it it's they

717.2 --> 721.46
can't the pressure builds up and they

719.24 --> 723.35
just evade and it's the same kind of

721.46 --> 728.27
effect it's the same psychological

723.35 --> 733.22
system it prevents the the inner

728.27 --> 736.31
conscience from letting something sink

733.22 --> 738.65
in in order to prevent damage but that

736.31 --> 741.26
also means that the intuition actually

738.65 --> 743.84
does does it because your consciousness

741.26 --> 745.85
can't look at it and then judge if it's

743.84 --> 749.08
can be allowed because if your

745.85 --> 752.78
consciousness looks at it too too widely

749.08 --> 756.23
it'll assimilate the knowledge it'll

752.78 --> 759.1999999999999
never forget it again so that's why it's

756.23 --> 761.3000000000001
mostly instinctive to bypass the

759.2 --> 764.0600000000001
consciousness and it is with the ballers

761.3 --> 766.04
and then the baller religion it's kind

764.06 --> 768.64
of the same like people that can't admit

766.04 --> 768.64
their mistakes

774.43 --> 781.39
huh what do we had question L Janka how

778.99 --> 787.26
didn't you feel yourself when it seemed

781.39 --> 787.26
in the earth and slit well what

792.38 --> 800.78
well Flat Earth has had very a very wide

796.67 --> 802.52
amount of responses with me in the

800.78 --> 805.6
different periods of my life very

802.52 --> 808.73
different responses to it I've always

805.6 --> 810.77
seen it as like a curiosity like yeah

808.73 --> 812.51
that's out there there is something to

810.77 --> 816.8
it but I don't understand it yet but I'm

812.51 --> 819.2
very curious but never really delving

816.8 --> 822.9799999999999
into it because when I would too much I

819.2 --> 825.62
would find like hints strong hints like

822.98 --> 829.22
wait something that I'm trusting on very

825.62 --> 832.16
much so for my future even there's

829.22 --> 834.2900000000001
something wrong with it and then I would

832.16 --> 836.9599999999999
be so shocked in the moment that I would

834.29 --> 839.42
just walk away and like okay I'm putting

836.96 --> 842.1500000000001
this to the side again and even forgot

839.42 --> 845.38
why just that new I bumped into

842.15 --> 848.27
something I wasn't ready for and that's

845.38 --> 852.35
every time how yeah

848.27 --> 854.99
how Flat Earth confronted itself with me

852.35 --> 859.37
during my life but I always been

854.99 --> 861.8
fascinated just by the cosmogony element

859.37 --> 864.5
by the world design aspect of the maps

861.8 --> 866.9
that part fascinated me and like how

864.5 --> 869.45
they came to how they made the layouts

866.9 --> 873.8
and the celestial thing that is the part

869.45 --> 877.49
I always find very fascinating with old

873.8 --> 879.26
maps and Flat Earth and that's the

877.49 --> 881.8100000000001
really interesting part that will always

879.26 --> 883.55
drew me back in its probably from a

881.81 --> 888.16
designer's perspective because I've been

883.55 --> 891.89
drawing maps D&D Maps worlds for games a

888.16 --> 894.4399999999999
big chunk of my life I think probably

891.89 --> 897.23
since I was like 14 I started to draw

894.44 --> 898.07
that stuff a lot probably earlier since

897.23 --> 904.49
I was 12

898.07 --> 907.5100000000001
maps imaginary land maps and yeah so

904.49 --> 907.51
that drew me in and

908.58 --> 915.12
I don't know it each face each new face

913.29 --> 917.73
I was confronted with flat earth I

915.12 --> 921.48
approached it from other side so for

917.73 --> 923.22
example one of the more clearer memories

921.48 --> 931.91
of having been confronted with Flat

923.22 --> 936.36
Earth was when I was around 2012 I think

931.91 --> 938.37
right yeah when I saw the presumed Eric

936.36 --> 940.8290000000001
Dubay video in the dark world vision

938.37 --> 946.019
because how the hell could that be on

940.829 --> 948.6899999999999
the internet already weird maybe it was

946.019 --> 953.76
I don't know maybe it's just jumbled it

948.69 --> 956.6700000000001
was a very tense time also and back then

953.76 --> 960.8389999999999
I was a lot in Alex Jones and really in

956.67 --> 962.61
the conspiracies scene big time for for

960.839 --> 964.95
quite some time already I'm really like

962.61 --> 966.839
ok I want to be a prepper I want to be

964.95 --> 971.339
organic have been for a while like

966.839 --> 975.5600000000001
totally getting into this mode of evil

971.339 --> 978.1800000000001
avoiding societal traps poisons and

975.56 --> 980.0699999999999
crazy stuff and then when I got

978.18 --> 982.14
confronted with flattered certainly it

980.07 --> 982.73
made a lot more sense like wait there is

982.14 --> 986.31
more

982.73 --> 988.11
now I can suddenly look at it because I

986.31 --> 990.17
have a framework in my mind and a

988.11 --> 992.94
mindset of conspiracy thinking and

990.17 --> 994.2299999999999
perceived enemies that this actually

992.94 --> 995.85
fits in between

994.23 --> 998.73
it doesn't just slap me in the face

995.85 --> 1000.74
anymore because I was already figuring

998.73 --> 1003.529
out that I can't really trust society

1000.74 --> 1006.47
from the top down and that's how it

1003.529 --> 1011.029
certainly did manage to make sense

1006.47 --> 1013.22
and stick but then I was very kind of

1011.029 --> 1015.82
personally confronted with it in several

1013.22 --> 1019.97
occasions like the guy I told the story

1015.82 --> 1023.24
did a kind of an in his book store a

1019.97 --> 1025.22
lecture about conspiracies and Flat

1023.24 --> 1028.61
Earth chemtrails and all kinds of things

1025.22 --> 1029.8700000000001
and he was confronted and threatened

1028.61 --> 1031.8799999999999
like yeah if you're gonna do that we're

1029.87 --> 1033.9799999999998
gonna get you fired and gonna confiscate

1031.88 --> 1036.949
your kid and like he was like totally

1033.98 --> 1038.839
shocked and we lost contact after that

1036.949 --> 1040.0600000000002
and he never wanted to ever talk about

1038.839 --> 1043.4199999999998
Flat Earth ever again

1040.06 --> 1047.11
so that was shocking and then eventually

1043.42 --> 1054.13
I moved on with my girlfriend he's now

1047.11 --> 1056.8899999999999
my ex and she she kind of embraced it at

1054.13 --> 1060.25
first but then when we started talking

1056.89 --> 1062.8600000000001
about it with her friends she has a

1060.25 --> 1066.79
friend circle they went ballistic over

1062.86 --> 1068.5
it some of them were like into 911 some

1066.79 --> 1071.3799999999999
of these guys and they were already like

1068.5 --> 1072.93
ah this is a conspiracy theory most of

1071.38 --> 1076.99
her friends were very mainstream

1072.93 --> 1079.15
thinkers but dentists very smart people

1076.99 --> 1082.36
but just very reliant upon the

1079.15 --> 1084.5800000000002
mainstream or very going with the

1082.36 --> 1087.04
narrative I guess that that attitude and

1084.58 --> 1090.01
more knowledgeable about medical things

1087.04 --> 1091.72
just in their field and then when we

1090.01 --> 1094.51
introduced the freakin Flat Earth they

1091.72 --> 1097.66
they went totally nuts and I think that

1094.51 --> 1100.54
probably contributed a lot to her

1097.66 --> 1103.8100000000002
realizing that this wasn't gonna work

1100.54 --> 1107.59
out because I was going crazy over it

1103.81 --> 1110.56
not like getting angry I get more angry

1107.59 --> 1113.86
about the whole Alex Jones things then

1110.56 --> 1116.6799999999998
flat earth even like people were being

1113.86 --> 1118.0
all Pro Obama and all that [ __ ] know

1116.68 --> 1122.44
what's going on there the Netherlands

1118.0 --> 1123.76
badly is such a Bhama indoctrination in

1122.44 --> 1129.75
the media here in the Netherlands it was

1123.76 --> 1129.75
just nuts it made me throw up almost and

1131.52 --> 1138.34
yeah she just I don't know I wouldn't I

1136.18 --> 1141.49
said like no this is the truth we gotta

1138.34 --> 1144.1299999999999
figure this out somehow and she just saw

1141.49 --> 1145.51
like okay if I'm it could literally

1144.13 --> 1147.5500000000002
almost read her thought I don't think

1145.51 --> 1150.28
she actually said it much like yeah if

1147.55 --> 1154.32
you're I'm gonna go with him then I'm

1150.28 --> 1157.03
probably gonna lose all my friends and

1154.32 --> 1159.4299999999998
she wasn't really ready to do that and

1157.03 --> 1161.3799999999999
to be fair I wouldn't want to do that to

1159.43 --> 1166.95
her as well because she has a glorious

1161.38 --> 1172.1200000000001
future but yeah

1166.95 --> 1174.6100000000001
you know Juan Carlos you freaking

1172.12 --> 1176.37
[ __ ] you have no idea what you're

1174.61 --> 1178.8999999999999
talking about

1176.37 --> 1180.09
what's the most amazing woman I've ever

1178.9 --> 1184.5700000000002
met

1180.09 --> 1186.6699999999998
still although she's definitely not

1184.57 --> 1190.33
perfect but she's imperfect in the

1186.67 --> 1201.49
perfect way it's just I couldn't handle

1190.33 --> 1204.04
it and now I always keep telling myself

1201.49 --> 1207.1
if I were her I would have just gotten a

1204.04 --> 1211.3
job and it might have prevented this

1207.1 --> 1213.07
situation from aggravating because after

1211.3 --> 1214.87
that period I kind of went into

1213.07 --> 1217.84
depression like didn't know where to go

1214.87 --> 1221.4699999999998
and eventually even totally forgot about

1217.84 --> 1223.2099999999998
Flat Earth I had a moment after after

1221.47 --> 1227.29
the breakup I kind of didn't talk about

1223.21 --> 1229.9
it much anymore after the breakup I like

1227.29 --> 1232.09
threw it all in the garbage get all my

1229.9 --> 1233.3500000000001
thinking because it everything was all

1232.09 --> 1237.25
tied in with her anyway

1233.35 --> 1239.29
and then I forgot about it and started

1237.25 --> 1242.97
proceeding like maybe I should design

1239.29 --> 1245.26
Space Station's now from that totally in

1242.97 --> 1248.92
knowledgeable depression mode it's weird

1245.26 --> 1253.15
and then the guy in the role-playing

1248.92 --> 1255.13
group the weird Jesus looking guy he he

1253.15 --> 1256.3600000000001
trolled me with Flat Earth when I talked

1255.13 --> 1259.3300000000002
about Space Station's

1256.36 --> 1261.4299999999998
and I was like what the [ __ ] then I

1259.33 --> 1264.25
looked up mark Sargent on the internet

1261.43 --> 1266.77
and that's how I entered the scene so

1264.25 --> 1272.4
yeah a lot has happened and that's just

1266.77 --> 1272.4
the last last 10 years

1276.469 --> 1283.8300000000002
right I know it's okay it's everything

1280.95 --> 1284.94
is fine it was supposed to have to

1283.83 --> 1288.21
happen that way

1284.94 --> 1291.059
and besides in retrospect really big

1288.21 --> 1293.309
important that I kind of overlooked even

1291.059 --> 1295.619
in this conversation and that is she

1293.309 --> 1300.989
didn't want to have kids and I found

1295.619 --> 1305.789
that quite intolerable because just our

1300.989 --> 1308.339
kids would have been just incredible she

1305.789 --> 1313.83
had the right guy the hips you know for

1308.339 --> 1315.839
a guy with my head size it's just my

1313.83 --> 1318.509
instinct was just like we have to have

1315.839 --> 1320.809
kids and she just didn't even want to

1318.509 --> 1323.3990000000001
talk about it and so I kind of forgot

1320.809 --> 1326.6689999999999
but it turned me depressed just the

1323.399 --> 1329.9989999999998
logos was out of it I couldn't uphold my

1326.669 --> 1333.239
real energy power which was what i lured

1329.999 --> 1339.21
her in in the first place I she she just

1333.239 --> 1343.409
set me on this mighty energy focus and

1339.21 --> 1345.719
not like a Luciferian like really logos

1343.409 --> 1347.6390000000001
and I would be a little bit of a

1345.719 --> 1350.3890000000001
prankster but just a little bit not

1347.639 --> 1354.1789999999999
really hurt more like I'm now I guess

1350.389 --> 1355.559
really strong in in retrospect I did

1354.179 --> 1360.0590000000002
kind of have the same kind of energy

1355.559 --> 1363.779
that I've mustered over here but even

1360.059 --> 1367.979
with more determination it's just real

1363.779 --> 1371.249
logos real in love and and not just sex

1367.979 --> 1376.1390000000001
sex was just side effect basically to

1371.249 --> 1378.839
that love yeah and am i okay maybe there

1376.139 --> 1380.58
is somebody out there but I really

1378.839 --> 1384.33
haven't made up my mind even in

1380.58 --> 1386.279
visualizing it what to approach because

1384.33 --> 1388.71
I don't think there are a lot of really

1386.279 --> 1391.559
hot chicks out there on the same level

1388.71 --> 1397.999
as money hacks that are willing to have

1391.559 --> 1401.279
children unless I am like really just

1397.999 --> 1403.1390000000001
doing fantastic doing financially

1401.279 --> 1405.719
fantastic being very creative very

1403.139 --> 1406.119
inspiring I might be able to do that at

1405.719 --> 1410.3790000000001
some

1406.119 --> 1412.629
point if I'm lucky if the right momentum

1410.379 --> 1416.589
arrives look if enough energy gathers

1412.629 --> 1420.4889999999998
they will come you know it happens it

1416.589 --> 1423.9089999999999
happens every time I was pretty damn

1420.489 --> 1427.419
strong when when I bumped in to my axe

1423.909 --> 1429.8490000000002
in that moment I literally had money a

1427.419 --> 1435.1290000000001
lot of money I was being very creative

1429.849 --> 1440.019
and basically was going through visions

1435.129 --> 1443.769
and felt it not really remembered it but

1440.019 --> 1446.139
felt it it's and that just gave me all

1443.769 --> 1448.059
this determination and strength and

1446.139 --> 1451.059
vision for the future and I had done

1448.059 --> 1455.049
some really odd magical things as well

1451.059 --> 1458.259
like not creepy rituals but period is

1455.049 --> 1462.009
subtle rituals and even in public where

1458.259 --> 1464.549
I would go in a full rope and and the

1462.009 --> 1467.559
weird thing is like others were apathy I

1464.549 --> 1469.6589999999999
was just into the wicker thing and then

1467.559 --> 1472.689
it's just weird when you're into that

1469.659 --> 1474.6390000000001
mood you recognize others that are doing

1472.689 --> 1476.199
it as well when normal people just think

1474.639 --> 1479.559
yeah it's just somebody dressing up and

1476.199 --> 1490.3890000000001
I it was an incredible time before that

1479.559 --> 1495.819
time from 2003 I guess to 2010 was a

1490.389 --> 1499.2389999999998
pretty incredible time for me and really

1495.819 --> 1502.1689999999999
freaky dark world insane [ __ ] as well

1499.239 --> 1507.719
it's also the period when I was poisoned

1502.169 --> 1507.719
with ayahuasca I think

1508.15 --> 1514.91
twice in that period I weird [ __ ] my

1512.93 --> 1517.4
life can get really weird and it's just

1514.91 --> 1520.0
I don't know I sometimes wonder is that

1517.4 --> 1522.68
even real or was that in the dark world

1520.0 --> 1525.17
because as I said I've experienced

1522.68 --> 1528.98
things that just can't be in the normal

1525.17 --> 1531.65
world and in the dark world I would be

1528.98 --> 1534.53
taking the ayahuasca and technically

1531.65 --> 1536.72
that just makes it even weirder like

1534.53 --> 1538.55
what is going on is this in the real

1536.72 --> 1540.98
world that where I'm taking these drugs

1538.55 --> 1544.43
or is it like an after effect in the

1540.98 --> 1546.5
dark world like an aftershock from

1544.43 --> 1549.38
before from the time and that I took it

1546.5 --> 1552.02
before I don't know this stuff yeah

1549.38 --> 1558.65
bummer clap boom clap Gator fish

1552.02 --> 1567.26
poisoned in the sense wait no no no no

1558.65 --> 1571.4
the one look in 97 is when the most

1567.26 --> 1573.8
things happen and it had a huge huge

1571.4 --> 1576.26
massive impact on my mental health and

1573.8 --> 1581.36
my stress levels and my metabolism

1576.26 --> 1584.75
quality bad influence very pressuring

1581.36 --> 1587.8999999999999
and I recovered over time it took me a

1584.75 --> 1590.3
long time but the second time I know I

1587.9 --> 1596.77
was literally poisoned where I can

1590.3 --> 1596.77
confirm it physically was in 2000 and

1604.0 --> 1612.679
2012 I think yeah in in a when I was

1609.679 --> 1614.48
going out it was just known somebody put

1612.679 --> 1619.3700000000001
put it in my drink to put a joke on me

1614.48 --> 1622.669
because I was defiant of Satanism

1619.37 --> 1625.25
basically and yeah that was in a bad

1622.669 --> 1629.0
place in the barkeeper was a satanic

1625.25 --> 1631.52
[ __ ] and yeah he did that to me and

1629.0 --> 1634.37
that gave me is very severe nightmare

1631.52 --> 1636.8899999999999
even in the moment I literally cried out

1634.37 --> 1639.289
in hellish anguish and ran away crying

1636.89 --> 1640.64
that was and everybody laughed I didn't

1639.289 --> 1641.45
thought it was really funny it was a

1640.64 --> 1645.5900000000001
nightmare

1641.45 --> 1653.179
what happened like serious nightmare yes

1645.59 --> 1656.809
anyway yeah I I'm not too eager to take

1653.179 --> 1659.39
drinks from people I don't know if you

1656.809 --> 1661.78
know what I mean and that's why I

1659.39 --> 1664.2800000000002
literally always bring my own drinks or

1661.78 --> 1666.3799999999999
if I go somewhere I want to see the

1664.28 --> 1668.299
bottle being open or know that the

1666.38 --> 1673.25
people are just absolutely trustworthy

1668.299 --> 1675.32
by their energy frequency I never will

1673.25 --> 1678.1
trust people that can't be trusted with

1675.32 --> 1678.1
that ever again

1684.71 --> 1692.6390000000001
so yeah that's another background

1688.08 --> 1696.049
history of arwen our wind background

1692.639 --> 1699.599
history I'm almost like video

1696.049 --> 1704.6689999999999
publicizing my autobiography I guess

1699.599 --> 1707.58
it's a thing I'm doing and I guess I'm

1704.669 --> 1709.979
doing it to get a better oversight and I

1707.58 --> 1713.399
find it interesting which is I guess a

1709.979 --> 1716.419
little bit narcissistic maybe and I hope

1713.399 --> 1719.6999999999998
you guys find it interesting and well

1716.419 --> 1722.5490000000002
maybe it's like okay just let him talk

1719.7 --> 1725.45
he needs to talk about his life I don't

1722.549 --> 1729.08
know what you guys really think about it

1725.45 --> 1732.44
are we not goofy things for that that's

1729.08 --> 1732.4399999999998
that's cool

1737.899 --> 1745.2589999999998
all right wits uh Watson yeah the the

1742.019 --> 1747.599
Mercator map I put it in the background

1745.259 --> 1750.359
because it is among one of the most

1747.599 --> 1754.589
mysterious considering it is the prime

1750.359 --> 1757.289
source for the the presupposed North

1754.589 --> 1758.969
Pole island or the continent beyond the

1757.289 --> 1765.479
North because hey it's still a

1758.969 --> 1769.289
projection not literal and it's one of

1765.479 --> 1772.769
the first things I bumped into in 2014

1769.289 --> 1775.289
and 15 concerning flattered that I just

1772.769 --> 1777.179
directly tied in with Flat Earth that

1775.289 --> 1778.559
you could like shove in somebody's face

1777.179 --> 1780.179
and they would be like what the hell is

1778.559 --> 1782.549
this I don't recognize this and yeah

1780.179 --> 1785.009
this is this is the Flat Earth

1782.549 --> 1789.479
that's how it started out so that's why

1785.009 --> 1791.309
I use that picture it's it's not my

1789.479 --> 1793.0800000000002
model I don't consider it a model I

1791.309 --> 1796.109
consider it a very interesting map the

1793.08 --> 1798.6589999999999
model that I am entertaining is the

1796.109 --> 1802.71
model you can see below the video

1798.659 --> 1806.69
picture a rectangular looping Flat Earth

1802.71 --> 1809.729
which can of course be represented

1806.69 --> 1811.229
literal because there is a looping

1809.729 --> 1813.299
element to it and you can't really

1811.229 --> 1815.76
represent that unless you literally loop

1813.299 --> 1819.01
everything infinite

1815.76 --> 1821.14
but that would never look as real as it

1819.01 --> 1831.19
would in reality because yeah the site

1821.14 --> 1834.3090000000002
has a limited range diffraction limit so

1831.19 --> 1837.22
yeah the real Flat Earth the real Earth

1834.309 --> 1842.28
geometry and design and how it all works

1837.22 --> 1848.98
is probably the most complex or real and

1842.28 --> 1850.3799999999999
biggest mystery of creation I think the

1848.98 --> 1853.38
earth is surreal

1850.38 --> 1853.38
literally

1864.06 --> 1871.94
[Music]

1866.73 --> 1876.029
I don't know what crypto operates I did

1871.94 --> 1878.279
register with something that lift of

1876.029 --> 1883.249
Hill mentioned website and what's it

1878.279 --> 1883.249
called again where did I put it

1885.889 --> 1892.109
Christ I have too many links we're gonna

1889.409 --> 1902.279
put it oh yeah

1892.109 --> 1904.139
no wait not it's not twitch this is just

1902.279 --> 1907.519
genius I didn't put out a bookmark

1904.139 --> 1907.519
that's just brilliant

1909.919 --> 1914.46
great now I'm gonna have to look in my

1912.059 --> 1923.489
email to figure out what actually

1914.46 --> 1928.08
register - oh yeah

1923.489 --> 1932.94
it's called D life it's a new streaming

1928.08 --> 1935.4289999999999
community yeah D life I don't know

1932.94 --> 1938.3890000000001
I'm also registered to toot which by the

1935.429 --> 1941.6390000000001
way I haven't really done anything but I

1938.389 --> 1943.83
do have like this back-up plan like okay

1941.639 --> 1945.9289999999999
YouTube I'm kind of doing a YouTube only

1943.83 --> 1952.6789999999999
thing but I am thinking of spreading out

1945.929 --> 1957.539
in other not so mainstream type

1952.679 --> 1961.47
platforms just just to see what would

1957.539 --> 1963.899
happen and to also see how those

1961.47 --> 1966.179
platforms actually interface how that'll

1963.899 --> 1969.059
works okay how could I tie you know and

1966.179 --> 1970.71
I oh I want to try that out I could

1969.059 --> 1973.9189999999999
probably use some help with that some

1970.71 --> 1978.779
people that are more savvy at social

1973.919 --> 1981.509
media interfaces so yeah if you think

1978.779 --> 1984.179
you could help me out then please

1981.509 --> 1984.929
contact me on skype it would be much

1984.179 --> 1989.1490000000001
appreciated

1984.929 --> 1989.1490000000001
anyway I registered on D life

1997.33 --> 2001.98
it seems very gamer Asia also

2008.87 --> 2011.87
okay

2014.89 --> 2023.7700000000002
ah see I don't think I have a chat my

2020.74 --> 2025.96
channel do I have a channel streamer is

2023.77 --> 2027.46
offline okay apparently I do have that

2025.96 --> 2030.28
channel but as long as there's nothing

2027.46 --> 2033.8500000000001
really on there I think it's just like a

2030.28 --> 2037.99
streaming thing so I think I could

2033.85 --> 2040.9299999999998
probably do YouTube live streaming and

2037.99 --> 2043.39
then forward it to that other thing it

2040.93 --> 2045.0700000000002
should probably not be too difficult but

2043.39 --> 2047.25
anyway I'm gonna try it out in near

2045.07 --> 2047.25
future

2062.83 --> 2070.96
huh wow it's already 15 past three still

2068.65 --> 2077.14
haven't had any guests and I haven't

2070.96 --> 2081.37
sneezed a single time ha I'm healthy I

2077.14 --> 2085.75
told you I told you yesterday this is

2081.37 --> 2089.79
not a typical cold it's really it did

2085.75 --> 2089.79
feel much more like an allergic reaction

2089.88 --> 2095.1400000000003
maybe it triggered or combined with a

2092.92 --> 2101.83
psychosomatic reaction although I don't

2095.14 --> 2105.19
remember well maybe it was Randy the

2101.83 --> 2107.49
other day he he was sharing about how he

2105.19 --> 2110.56
was really sick maybe that kind of

2107.49 --> 2112.93
psychosomatically planted a slow-growing

2110.56 --> 2114.66
seat I don't know I don't know where I

2112.93 --> 2117.64
got it

2114.66 --> 2119.35
but anyway I'm doing pretty good I don't

2117.64 --> 2121.69
even have a runny nose have you seen me

2119.35 --> 2127.3199999999997
grab for a tissue not even once

2121.69 --> 2133.71
so I'm doing great it's just that I

2127.32 --> 2135.04
still forgot the organs name I'm such a

2133.71 --> 2138.33
word

2135.04 --> 2138.33
[ __ ] sometimes

2145.18 --> 2150.41
right my pancreas yeah my pancreas is

2148.49 --> 2152.7099999999996

PayPal or become a member of my patreon

2169.88 --> 2176.87
page there's not a lot of activity there

2173.66 --> 2181.1
just yet but hey I've seen other people

2176.87 --> 2182.45
use that platform and if I do get more

2181.1 --> 2185.24
subscribers to it

2182.45 --> 2186.4399999999996
I will definitely like tinker with it at

2185.24 --> 2190.6699999999996
least see if I can do something

2186.44 --> 2194.12
interesting and maybe find some kind of

2190.67 --> 2198.4700000000003
way to interact that I could do like a

2194.12 --> 2201.5899999999997
vote thing okay like what subject what's

2198.47 --> 2205.4599999999996
like okay there's three subjects which

2201.59 --> 2207.53
one would you like me to bring up that

2205.46 --> 2208.9700000000003
you can vote with your membership

2207.53 --> 2209.96
something like that I don't know it

2208.97 --> 2212.33
could be small

2209.96 --> 2214.54
also I've been considering getting some

2212.33 --> 2217.97
paraphernalia

2214.54 --> 2221.54
I've been working on that in the

2217.97 --> 2226.85
background ideas and could be kind of

2221.54 --> 2228.05
fun like for example a hashtag me if a

2226.85 --> 2230.87
keychain thingy

2228.05 --> 2234.6200000000003
it's probably really easy to make and

2230.87 --> 2237.23
it's kind of funny these kind of little

2234.62 --> 2239.66
thingies and I don't know maybe I'll be

2237.23 --> 2243.68
giving them away as prizes or something

2239.66 --> 2244.8799999999997
for for donators I've been thinking yeah

2243.68 --> 2248.12
I've been talking about this with

2244.88 --> 2254.81
somebody so as a good mind for this kind

2248.12 --> 2260.0
of things or yeah why not a special our

2254.81 --> 2263.57
win Ian glas.t or Nora we need muck and

2260.0 --> 2266.24
our weenie in tea mug or an early-bird

2263.57 --> 2269.32
mug I don't know is something like that

2266.24 --> 2269.3199999999997
little things

2269.92 --> 2280.6
yeah you are showing in my chat Merle

2272.74 --> 2284.16
Beauregard I can definitely see you I am

2280.6 --> 2284.16
Arwen are you serious

2285.84 --> 2292.7400000000002
god

2287.23 --> 2292.7400000000002
really that's

2297.76 --> 2303.0400000000004
maybe I could do something funny with

2299.95 --> 2304.66
that though I don't have to be careful

2303.04 --> 2306.46
before some troll takes my idea but

2304.66 --> 2310.0499999999997
maybe I could do a t-shirt with I am

2306.46 --> 2313.18
Arwen with me winner with one of my more

2310.05 --> 2318.52
weird faces moments or something just

2313.18 --> 2320.8799999999997
really funny look I don't know just

2318.52 --> 2324.609
fooling around

2320.88 --> 2326.9700000000003
but yeah why not but I don't necessarily

2324.609 --> 2330.93
want to go into t-shirts and everything

2326.97 --> 2330.93
it's more like little things

2333.69 --> 2339.58
paraphernalia now if I'm gonna do

2336.28 --> 2342.76
t-shirts that's that's always going to

2339.58 --> 2344.35
be like in a buying Internet it's not

2342.76 --> 2347.4100000000003
something I could just give away because

2344.35 --> 2352.75
take some money to get printed t-shirts

2347.41 --> 2359.47
so but maybe in after a while I will

2352.75 --> 2362.95
have early bird show t-shirts or our win

2359.47 --> 2367.3799999999997
the wizard Elf t-shirts something weird

2362.95 --> 2367.3799999999997
funny why not

2369.76 --> 2372.6600000000003
No

2373.25 --> 2383.31
definitely not hmm anyway yeah still no

2380.64 --> 2386.8799999999997
power panel members and slightly

2383.31 --> 2388.86
disappointed although I think I'm doing

2386.88 --> 2395.58
fine just keep on talking and talking

2388.86 --> 2398.6400000000003
and talking uh get it but I'm gonna

2395.58 --> 2401.96
throw out the link just in case somebody

2398.64 --> 2401.96
would like to talk to me anyway

2410.339 --> 2415.16
it's not supposed to be funny with sour

2412.68 --> 2415.16
Watson

2430.01 --> 2437.9
I got a text message back from my

2435.74 --> 2440.06
landlord he seems to be fine because he

2437.9 --> 2441.14
doesn't have to do anything and doesn't

2440.06 --> 2446.18
have to pay for anything and then

2441.14 --> 2447.8599999999997
everything is always fine I really hope

2446.18 --> 2450.0499999999997
he doesn't watch my early bird show he

2447.86 --> 2456.76
probably doesn't I don't think he's that

2450.05 --> 2460.61
good at English our winni and alchemy we

2456.76 --> 2463.28
well maybe our winni and gravity you

2460.61 --> 2469.13
know I know I don't really ascribe to

2463.28 --> 2470.69
gravity anymore but just as a I don't

2469.13 --> 2472.4
know maybe as a troll thing are we

2470.69 --> 2473.84
needing gravity I still like it I still

2472.4 --> 2475.85
have a sock account called

2473.84 --> 2478.28
our winning gravity or back up channel

2475.85 --> 2481.06
sort of with some of my gravity related

2478.28 --> 2481.0600000000004
hangouts on there

2487.13 --> 2496.369
ha wealthy Omega where t I don't think

2494.029 --> 2498.769
the entire field of historical

2496.369 --> 2504.4990000000003
scholarship agrees on that but certainly

2498.769 --> 2507.2589999999996
a sizable amount if not at least half so

2504.499 --> 2510.3799999999997
and I think they're still divided on

2507.259 --> 2513.319
which Jesus from what I heard vaguely

2510.38 --> 2516.9790000000003
from just talk of people that talk about

2513.319 --> 2519.2889999999998
this that there were two Jesus's two

2516.979 --> 2525.95
individuals that have been kind of mixed

2519.289 --> 2529.46
in somehow I don't know if that's if

2525.95 --> 2531.41
that's even still relevant though it's

2529.46 --> 2538.4
just digging back in memory from

2531.41 --> 2542.0589999999997
probably five to ten years ago oh [ __ ]

2538.4 --> 2543.6800000000003
yeah that's that's right Michael Rock

2542.059 --> 2546.9500000000003
that is right

2543.68 --> 2550.64
oh and Benjamin did actually mention

2546.95 --> 2554.7189999999996
Nathan I think it was Nathan Oakley it

2550.64 --> 2556.7889999999998
I'd probably not Nathan Stallman from

2554.719 --> 2558.559
lift of him but he didn't say his back

2556.789 --> 2561.92
name but they were talking about

2558.559 --> 2565.039
debating and flatterer so Nathan yeah

2561.92 --> 2569.41
wow that would be absolutely amazing to

2565.039 --> 2569.4100000000003
have a mom lucky guy

2572.53 --> 2578.15
write my name on twitch Bumba clot off a

2575.75 --> 2582.62
bomb a cloud Gator fish is as you'd

2578.15 --> 2589.9900000000002
expect it's our win and so is it on

2582.62 --> 2589.99
derive or D life or what is it

2607.94 --> 2614.93
ha PJ I would like to come test that

2612.56 --> 2617.33
claim ancient Israel didn't exist

2614.93 --> 2621.3399999999997
if you ever considered that ancient

2617.33 --> 2629.93
Israel may have just been Phoenicia

2621.34 --> 2633.01
really no it's that region the Israel's

2629.93 --> 2640.04
writing Phoenicia and then around the

2633.01 --> 2644.1800000000003
Dead Sea so I don't know I think to

2640.04 --> 2646.72
claim that it exists this is kind of

2644.18 --> 2646.72
stretching it

2655.16 --> 2657.79
Hey

2665.359 --> 2672.95
right PJ you're such a Bible expert man

2668.739 --> 2675.7690000000002
thanks for the advice like yeah your

2672.95 --> 2681.709
opinion is very valued compared to

2675.769 --> 2683.1499999999996
people like like Paula and Theo cuz yeah

2681.709 --> 2686.1499999999996
what they're a talking about they only

2683.15 --> 2689.359
read the whole thing and study it for

2686.15 --> 2692.029
half a lifetime you know and you

2689.359 --> 2694.999
obviously know a lot more about it than

2692.029 --> 2703.4
they so thank you for your opinion very

2694.999 --> 2718.269
much valued I was being sarcastic by the

2703.4 --> 2718.2690000000002
way LEP

2718.359 --> 2723.799
did Moses believed the earth was flat

2720.68 --> 2729.019
was it ever mentioned or was that in one

2723.799 --> 2731.509
of the Moses more spiritual adventures

2729.019 --> 2733.5789999999997
because if I remember correctly and

2731.509 --> 2737.869
again I have to admit I didn't literally

2733.579 --> 2743.42
read it by robe a Darwin bird I'd like

2737.869 --> 2747.4
fragments of it here there but I think

2743.42 --> 2750.739
Moses went through like real-world

2747.4 --> 2755.239
typical societal experiences but also

2750.739 --> 2758.2690000000002
these surreal experiences with even

2755.239 --> 2761.7490000000003
going to heaven or something what's that

2758.269 --> 2764.18
what's that Moses or was that was it

2761.749 --> 2767.229
another guy sorry I'm sorry I'm making

2764.18 --> 2767.229
such a mess of this

2784.8 --> 2791.7000000000003
hello well leb and enough that's

2788.369 --> 2796.29
comparable because the Big Bang has

2791.7 --> 2798.6
always been a theory and then some

2796.29 --> 2803.2799999999997
people that entertain the theory brag

2798.6 --> 2805.56
very sloppily angrily so that oh it is

2803.28 --> 2807.27
true it has to be it doesn't mean that

2805.56 --> 2808.95
it's more than just a theory it's just

2807.27 --> 2811.91
like with evolution that's even more

2808.95 --> 2815.43
ridiculed now like seriously guys

2811.91 --> 2819.1189999999997
creation is having a major major

2815.43 --> 2823.56
comeback in the world and evolutionists

2819.119 --> 2828.86
have big trouble it's entered kids

2823.56 --> 2831.33
cartoons it's entered mainstream

2828.86 --> 2835.5
thinking and talk shows that the

2831.33 --> 2837.7999999999997
creation is widely debated and evolution

2835.5 --> 2840.66
is not taken for granted so much anymore

2837.8 --> 2844.02
just holy-shit vermelha

2840.66 --> 2851.0099999999998
and again remember South Park what an

2844.02 --> 2854.609
amazing episode that one was sir so yeah

2851.01 --> 2857.55
just to know according to Darwin you're

2854.609 --> 2859.59
all a bunch of [ __ ] fish frogs that

2857.55 --> 2861.54
had sex with another [ __ ] fish frog

2859.59 --> 2864.119
till they crawl out of the water and

2861.54 --> 2867.8
then eventually turn into monkeys and

2864.119 --> 2867.8
then you fell out of a monkey's butt

2869.48 --> 2882.2400000000002
right no sir mrs. Garrison's explanation

2873.84 --> 2884.79
I love that part but the concept of

2882.24 --> 2887.4599999999996
fools evolution theory is still holding

2884.79 --> 2890.25
strong that image is being giving out

2887.46 --> 2893.04
given out by very mainstream [ __ ]

2890.25 --> 2895.23
but alternative media creation is all

2893.04 --> 2898.67
over the place it's widely debated

2895.23 --> 2901.29
creation versus evolution concepts

2898.67 --> 2904.17
evolution is spreading out outside of

2901.29 --> 2907.71
the core all the way and adaptation is

2904.17 --> 2912.4700000000003
being discussed openly and in the

2907.71 --> 2912.4700000000003
mainstream it's

2913.44 --> 2919.39
yeah it's discussed like there's the

2917.14 --> 2922.15
image given out almost like it's almost

2919.39 --> 2924.67
like the fake news level now that much

2922.15 --> 2927.539
does so it's already being discussed and

2924.67 --> 2930.579
outed on in mainstream by certain people

2927.539 --> 2935.2200000000003
so the evolution theory is in big

2930.579 --> 2935.2200000000003
trouble even in in science world

2950.21 --> 2957.9900000000002
now that's that's a very nice official

2954.39 --> 2960.5299999999997
way to say that it's very likely that

2957.99 --> 2960.5299999999997
Jesus existed

2969.559 --> 2972.65
you know

2973.4 --> 2976.489
[Music]

2977.75 --> 2982.21
the yeah there's because there is a

2980.18 --> 2985.04
problem with ancient history and

2982.21 --> 2987.71
falsification of evidence look if you

2985.04 --> 2990.17
want to falsify something really quickly

2987.71 --> 2992.27
that's gonna be hard and people are

2990.17 --> 2994.7000000000003
probably gonna see look through it but

2992.27 --> 2995.42
if you had planned to falsify it all

2994.7 --> 2998.7799999999997
along

2995.42 --> 3001.33
planned out for hundreds of years then

2998.78 --> 3003.73
you can make false things ahead of time

3001.33 --> 3006.52
in order to be covered discovered at a

3003.73 --> 3009.849
later time and even kind of fake that

3006.52 --> 3012.46
degrade by which the material will be

3009.849 --> 3015.5800000000004
measured as if from what agent will come

3012.46 --> 3018.28
if they really want to falsify the whole

3015.58 --> 3020.89
thing that's the problem is very

3018.28 --> 3024.4300000000003
paranoid conspiracy thinking in that

3020.89 --> 3027.7599999999998
sense but look so much of the Newell

3024.43 --> 3031.69
order plans of the the false worldview

3027.76 --> 3036.1600000000003
has been designed so long ago this could

3031.69 --> 3038.17
definitely be part of it and we're

3036.16 --> 3040.7799999999997
already figuring out that known lies are

3038.17 --> 3045.73
pretty much adopted mainstream in

3040.78 --> 3050.619
history so I wouldn't be surprised if

3045.73 --> 3054.88
even some historical evidence that would

3050.619 --> 3056.83
be regarded as absolutely true or very

3054.88 --> 3060.07
likely to be true could even be

3056.83 --> 3064.96
falsified sounds very pessimistic when I

3060.07 --> 3067.599
say it but it might be done with with

3064.96 --> 3074.83
proper planning and technology and at

3067.599 --> 3078.869
very specific devious again but yeah

3074.83 --> 3085.42
until evidence of that pops up

3078.869 --> 3087.6400000000003
I'm just look to me even I believe Jesus

3085.42 --> 3091.38
exists as a person I don't believe

3087.64 --> 3093.94
everything that is put in his shoes is

3091.38 --> 3096.31
literally what happened but I do believe

3093.94 --> 3098.349
that most of his character structure in

3096.31 --> 3100.72
his energy is represented accurately

3098.349 --> 3103.21
because she can't evade from that energy

3100.72 --> 3104.7999999999997
or it will break the whole thing the

3103.21 --> 3108.19
whole spell effect as it were the whole

3104.8 --> 3109.8100000000004
synchronicity so and that is what I'm

3108.19 --> 3111.38
focused on it's about the spirit it's

3109.81 --> 3115.009
about the energy it's about the methods

3111.38 --> 3118.609
it's about what Christ does and in that

3115.009 --> 3121.2690000000002
sense when you just have that to me it

3118.609 --> 3124.0389999999998
doesn't matter if he existed or not

3121.269 --> 3125.8089999999997
literally because it's not about that

3124.039 --> 3133.039
it's about the frequency it's about the

3125.809 --> 3139.0890000000004
path it's about the method what that was

3133.039 --> 3141.17
calling me stupid also calling for

3139.089 --> 3149.71
contacting it's really annoying anyway

3141.17 --> 3149.71
there was a tenth man right

3164.3 --> 3170.71
oh dear I think I try and trigger the

3167.45 --> 3170.71
joint discussion here

3177.3 --> 3187.4700000000003
yeah well see the whole thing about it

3180.0 --> 3192.21
all all of it is I've once entertained

3187.47 --> 3195.6899999999996
that the past could be changed and if

3192.21 --> 3199.76
that could be done in that context

3195.69 --> 3202.76
I've even through dark world vision and

3199.76 --> 3206.46
I can't confirm if that is just purely

3202.76 --> 3209.2200000000003
imaginative problem I hope so or that it

3206.46 --> 3212.91
is some real thing that is reflecting in

3209.22 --> 3216.0899999999997
the dark world that they at least would

3212.91 --> 3218.37
try to just erase Jesus from having ever

3216.09 --> 3222.03
existed and there would still be his

3218.37 --> 3225.39
teachings around but they wanted to

3222.03 --> 3227.88
prevent it or something based on the

3225.39 --> 3230.91
idea that that could be done it could

3227.88 --> 3234.0
also be like a spiritual a dark world

3230.91 --> 3236.2799999999997
metaphorical interpretation of them just

3234.0 --> 3239.55
wanting to erase the Christian culture

3236.28 --> 3243.42
which is blatantly obviously happening

3239.55 --> 3248.4900000000002
so it's all matter of perspective on

3243.42 --> 3249.9300000000003
that experience but I entertained that

3248.49 --> 3251.7299999999996
there might have been erased from

3249.93 --> 3253.6699999999996
history from having ever physically

3251.73 --> 3259.949
existed

3253.67 --> 3259.949
[Music]

3278.79 --> 3282.84
it was a tenth man again I don't know

3281.1 --> 3288.2999999999997
why it keeps him caught I'm gonna put it

3282.84 --> 3290.19
on busy so it doesn't happening I don't

3288.3 --> 3291.869
know why he's off should always be

3290.19 --> 3297.38
unbusy then you don't hear any calling

3291.869 --> 3297.38
anymore anyway hello chocolates saying

3301.34 --> 3306.9300000000003
open panel anyone could join please do

3304.47 --> 3312.33
big panel why I want a big panel get in

3306.93 --> 3314.31
here especially because I'm getting

3312.33 --> 3316.77
really hungry and I kind of want lunch

3314.31 --> 3318.2599999999998
oh by the way my pancreas is feeling a

3316.77 --> 3325.67
lot better

3318.26 --> 3325.67
so maybe just talking did a lot of good

3339.5 --> 3346.55
no Logan 16 if it was important he would

3343.64 --> 3348.62
just type it out in chat anyway I gave

3346.55 --> 3352.09
him a hangout link so if he really wants

3348.62 --> 3359.98
to join well you know it'd have to do it

3352.09 --> 3364.36
hey ranty are you doing hey Jew shifter

3359.98 --> 3364.36
huh see you in a while

3373.059 --> 3380.9790000000003
yeah Slick James is good for dead air

3377.669 --> 3384.3689999999997
can't say I disagree it definitely does

3380.979 --> 3389.459
know how to break in and break the flow

3384.369 --> 3392.219
of conversation for pointless conjecture

3389.459 --> 3396.3999999999996
it's not really relevant to anything

3392.219 --> 3399.309
it's a superficial distant analysis to

3396.4 --> 3402.2090000000003
detract from being involved that's what

3399.309 --> 3402.2090000000003
it seems to be doing

3415.36 --> 3439.84
right so join come on guys there's the

3436.36 --> 3442.84
link thanks Randy and I want you in here

3439.84 --> 3444.79
as well chocolate and leb why don't you

3442.84 --> 3458.98
get in here as well and then we can have

3444.79 --> 3463.09
a panel hey Randy yeah Easter what Happy

3458.98 --> 3468.88
Easter a pista Happy Easter

3463.09 --> 3471.79
Oh happy Easter oh right yeah

3468.88 --> 3473.2000000000003
how's things how's things going absent

3471.79 --> 3476.5
you've been going for 57 minutes but

3473.2 --> 3478.87
you've had nobody in nope no I had an

3476.5 --> 3481.33
internet cutoff actually so this is part

3478.87 --> 3482.83
two of to hang out that's really that's

3481.33 --> 3486.04
brutal you know when you should hold a

3482.83 --> 3487.96
live stream down on your oh you get such

3486.04 --> 3489.97
a drag voice for talking for such a long

3487.96 --> 3493.48
time you know iw50

3489.97 --> 3496.5099999999998
vena all right okay you're different

3493.48 --> 3498.7
what yeah talking for a while now so and

3496.51 --> 3500.98
I pretty much talked about everything I

3498.7 --> 3504.0099999999998
could talk about even went on rants

3500.98 --> 3506.35
about subjects but it's getting kind of

3504.01 --> 3510.4
yeah my inspiration is slightly drying

3506.35 --> 3513.49
up so glad you could join chemtrails

3510.4 --> 3516.34
let's talk about geoengineering okay

3513.49 --> 3520.39
fine I don't see any chemtrails are

3516.34 --> 3526.51
today by the way that's interesting how

3520.39 --> 3532.6
far away from the the sea oh I don't

3526.51 --> 3534.5200000000004
know 100 150 miles or something Wow it's

3532.6 --> 3536.7999999999997
interested in that for the entire years

3534.52 --> 3539.11
of in you know where I live which is

3536.8 --> 3541.51
essentially right on the coast we have

3539.11 --> 3543.9100000000003
have no visibility or yes oh we're

3541.51 --> 3547.26
talking over a hundred days and of

3543.91 --> 3550.06
complete whiteout

3547.26 --> 3553.3900000000003
an old visibility you know since you go

3550.06 --> 3555.4
back since the turn of the world before

3553.39 --> 3558.4
we even a turn of the you know last year

3555.4 --> 3561.1600000000003
you know talking and of end of November

3558.4 --> 3565.44
I would say but certainly this year all

3561.16 --> 3565.44
of this year no visibility at all

3565.74 --> 3572.7999999999997
complete wax out so I mean if you sin

3567.94 --> 3573.16
any of my recent videos yeah some of

3572.8 --> 3574.9900000000002
them

3573.16 --> 3578.08
oh it by the way it's fifty miles from

3574.99 --> 3580.9599999999996
the sea sorry right okay well yeah I

3578.08 --> 3584.98
mean I've been out today and even now I

3580.96 --> 3588.04
mean we've moved house so essentially

3584.98 --> 3591.4900000000002
I'm now facing the window so I get an

3588.04 --> 3593.23
opportunity to actually see this as it's

3591.49 --> 3596.08
going on eBook today I've been down to

3593.23 --> 3597.85
the to the promenade again and obviously

3596.08 --> 3600.8199999999997
I captured the camel trailing that was

3597.85 --> 3602.47
going on and I've somewhat kind of come

3600.82 --> 3604.3300000000004
to the conclusion that whatever the

3602.47 --> 3606.22
spraying up there the particulates that

3604.33 --> 3608.77
they're actually dropping has to be

3606.22 --> 3610.48
having an effect now on exactly what

3608.77 --> 3613.45
we're actually seeing of the visibility

3610.48 --> 3615.55
or the lack of visibility because

3613.45 --> 3619.21
there's no way that you can go down to

3615.55 --> 3622.3
the beach but a hundred days and not be

3619.21 --> 3624.28
able to see more than eight miles or so

3622.3 --> 3626.53
you know you can't even see the wind

3624.28 --> 3630.3700000000003
turbines you can't see burrowing third

3626.53 --> 3632.26
yeah all year long you know all year

3630.37 --> 3635.17
look I'm not even talking from the beach

3632.26 --> 3637.42
I'm talking from the top of the ramp at

3635.17 --> 3640.27
low tide so I'm like fifty feet above

3637.42 --> 3644.17
sea level you can't see anything it's

3640.27 --> 3647.44
like a complete haze out constantly that

3644.17 --> 3650.35
has been all year yeah wow that sounds

3647.44 --> 3651.94
almost like targeted I would think so

3650.35 --> 3655.36
because it was this time last year that

3651.94 --> 3657.9700000000003
I was getting the great shots of a

3655.36 --> 3661.27
barrel furnace and it's also interesting

3657.97 --> 3663.8799999999997
today that the weather's been like 23

3661.27 --> 3668.92
degrees so it's really nice the sun's

3663.88 --> 3671.65
out it's shining all day obviously we've

3668.92 --> 3673.66
got you know the sounds of really fat

3671.65 --> 3676.81
there's no wind you know so there's

3673.66 --> 3679.8999999999996
literally no wind that the waves are

3676.81 --> 3680.2
maybe a couple of inches or more you

3679.9 --> 3683.2000000000003
know

3680.2 --> 3684.609
about it very very still you know so you

3683.2 --> 3687.609
think it would be ideal

3684.609 --> 3689.8289999999997
the visibility but what I'm thinking is

3687.609 --> 3691.2999999999997
that as the drop in these chemtrails out

3689.829 --> 3693.4300000000003
at the back of the plane what's

3691.3 --> 3695.65
happening is these particular to slowly

3693.43 --> 3697.27
drop in a slowly drop in and because

3695.65 --> 3699.52
there's no wind because there's because

3697.27 --> 3701.44
it's still because you know or whatever

3699.52 --> 3704.05
is going on we're just not seeing

3701.44 --> 3710.01
anything and it's just complete haze all

3704.05 --> 3712.8390000000004
right yeah it just falls down and keeps

3710.01 --> 3714.67
waving out keeps on waving out until

3712.839 --> 3715.47
it's dispersed by some wind but yeah if

3714.67 --> 3718.2400000000002
there's no wind

3715.47 --> 3720.49
there's another quality the thing is

3718.24 --> 3722.7099999999996
even when it has been windy even when

3720.49 --> 3725.74
it's been windy even when it's been warm

3722.71 --> 3728.2
it's been cold it matters not we've had

3725.74 --> 3729.9399999999996
no visibility at all you know I know if

3728.2 --> 3731.98
it happened down there every single day

3729.94 --> 3733.69
since the turn of the year you know I've

3731.98 --> 3736.119
not released the videos why should that

3733.69 --> 3739.06
because there's no point in just keep

3736.119 --> 3740.8
showing stuff that there's no visibility

3739.06 --> 3742.99
oh the in fact he put in a video out

3740.8 --> 3745.7200000000003
every day you say hey guys look there's

3742.99 --> 3747.31
no visibility today you know I mean

3745.72 --> 3749.7099999999996
people are gonna get bored of that [ __ ]

3747.31 --> 3752.71
I mean I have done recently well it's a

3749.71 --> 3754.7200000000003
case of what you know now you're gonna

3752.71 --> 3755.95
give you a reason as to why you're not

3754.72 --> 3757.93
shooting all the time

3755.95 --> 3759.8489999999997
and show them like yeah it's shitty

3757.93 --> 3761.2
weather this yeah it's exactly you know

3759.849 --> 3764.079
I mean I can't just have a channel that

3761.2 --> 3767.319
puts no content out for an entire four

3764.079 --> 3769.119
months just one second hang on one sec

3767.319 --> 3775.5
yeah right yeah I've been joined by Theo

3769.119 --> 3780.78
by the way hello Oh Theo you're a mute

3775.5 --> 3780.78
hello hi thanks for joining the panel

3780.869 --> 3787.9300000000003
your time on the early bird show yeah

3785.89 --> 3794.17
first I gotta apologize for the Arwen

3787.93 --> 3797.23
debacle ARW en all right what about it

3794.17 --> 3799.63
oh I was I was calling you that a bunch

3797.23 --> 3803.47
of times but you I was doing it through

3799.63 --> 3807.65
a Google Talk oh I hadn't noticed I

3803.47 --> 3811.2599999999998
don't keep track of cool talks

3807.65 --> 3813.15
like those the yeah I just use google

3811.26 --> 3815.46
hangout screen for the back yet

3813.15 --> 3818.4500000000003
for security reasons I don't really

3815.46 --> 3822.15
follow all those endless amount of chats

3818.45 --> 3825.5699999999997
from every hangout ever done I don't

3822.15 --> 3827.7000000000003
keep track of it but not it was it was a

3825.57 --> 3830.7000000000003
few days ago and you actually commented

3827.7 --> 3832.23
on it so just get here in that oh yeah

3830.7 --> 3833.64
I've clearing that up that I wasn't

3832.23 --> 3835.23
trying to make fun of your name all

3833.64 --> 3837.6299999999997
right okay that's fine

3835.23 --> 3839.76
anyway Arendt is presenting something oh

3837.63 --> 3843.1800000000003
yeah yeah this is just this is just

3839.76 --> 3845.01
today's video this is I mean you get in

3843.18 --> 3846.5699999999997
a bit of blue skies now but I look out

3845.01 --> 3848.1000000000004
right if I want to take a video right

3846.57 --> 3851.55
now you won't believe but it's

3848.1 --> 3855.39
absolutely essentially why white mist

3851.55 --> 3856.5600000000004
with long lines of chemtrails and habit

3855.39 --> 3859.41
where you can see that there's still

3856.56 --> 3862.38
dispersing I sell for starting to block

3859.41 --> 3863.94
it out this is from essentially the same

3862.38 --> 3865.59
place that I always didn't film in all

3863.94 --> 3868.32
they got Baron furnace over here and

3865.59 --> 3869.76
then he got the buildings of barrel that

3868.32 --> 3871.26
are all around here the lighthouse

3869.76 --> 3872.7000000000003
accession it drops off and then you've

3871.26 --> 3875.13
got the wind turbines over in this

3872.7 --> 3877.5
location here and there's nothing

3875.13 --> 3879.12
there's nothing to it look how beautiful

3877.5 --> 3881.19
this day I mean I can't tell you how

3879.12 --> 3883.1099999999997
nice it is today but you can definitely

3881.19 --> 3885.27
see the chemtrails I'll just get to a

3883.11 --> 3887.94
point where we actually see this this I

3885.27 --> 3889.47
see him all over at huh yeah I mean

3887.94 --> 3894.14
there's no there's no real clouds

3889.47 --> 3896.5699999999997
there's no real clouds in this this is

3894.14 --> 3899.58
this there's no real clouds it's all

3896.57 --> 3901.9500000000003
chemtrails yeah maybe even ruining it

3899.58 --> 3904.62
I mean this particular one you can see

3901.95 --> 3907.29
it's spraying and you know I follow it

3904.62 --> 3909.38
back and I mean if that plane is flying

3907.29 --> 3912.42
at least so let's say 500 miles an hour

3909.38 --> 3915.96
it must have been covering a distance of

3912.42 --> 3917.19
probably six minutes or so flying over

3915.96 --> 3919.92
this particular distance where I'm

3917.19 --> 3921.77
capturing this chem trail from so six

3919.92 --> 3924.63
minutes of 500 miles an hour what's that

3921.77 --> 3928.11
about 50 miles so we've got a 50 mile

3924.63 --> 3929.12
chem trail up there Wow well go a 50

3928.11 --> 3931.28
Malcolm

3929.12 --> 3933.1099999999997
that this plane is just dropping and

3931.28 --> 3934.9700000000003
everything is just completely chemtrails

3933.11 --> 3937.4300000000003
it's a style of it but look how

3934.97 --> 3939.74
beautiful that the beach is and

3937.43 --> 3941.8999999999996
everything you know I mean I'll try I'll

3939.74 --> 3946.43
try and show ya here we go so this is me

3941.9 --> 3949.04
zooming into the into the actual to the

3946.43 --> 3951.83
water and you can just see how common

3949.04 --> 3954.65
and still it isn't seagulls are out the

3951.83 --> 3956.54
waters laying really calm you know

3954.65 --> 3958.19
you've got a few ripples and just the

3956.54 --> 3959.69
breaking waves at the shoreline which

3958.19 --> 3961.91
are probably no more than three or four

3959.69 --> 3963.77
inches in height this would have been an

3961.91 --> 3966.23
exceptional day to go down there and

3963.77 --> 3969.22
video but there's no invisibility and

3966.23 --> 3972.65
this is what it's been like all year and

3969.22 --> 3974.7799999999997
it's so frustrating because last year I

3972.65 --> 3977.51
had the p900 of this time of year this

3974.78 --> 3979.9100000000003
year I've got the t1000 and I'm not

3977.51 --> 3981.8900000000003
getting the opportunity to use it to go

3979.91 --> 3983.7799999999997
down there to get down to the to the one

3981.89 --> 3986.99
inch to the one foot observations and do

3983.78 --> 3991.4900000000002
this kind of stuff you know record in 4k

3986.99 --> 3992.2999999999997
you know I mean I can imagine it's very

3991.49 --> 3996.1099999999997
disappointing

3992.3 --> 3998.6600000000003
have you tried maybe trying in other

3996.11 --> 3999.28
coasts somewhere another location oh

3998.66 --> 4002.47
yeah

3999.28 --> 4004.42
everywhere in England it from from all

4002.47 --> 4007.0499999999997
accounts of the people that have been

4004.42 --> 4009.19
responded on there on the videos

4007.05 --> 4011.5
essentially it is this is what it's like

4009.19 --> 4013.48
on the coast lay for a lot of people

4011.5 --> 4016.06
throw throw a lot of people I'm gonna

4013.48 --> 4018.85
say it's everywhere because you know I

4016.06 --> 4020.65
haven't got that wider connection you

4018.85 --> 4023.11
know well a lot of people are saying

4020.65 --> 4025.81
that this is what they're seeing yeah in

4023.11 --> 4028.8700000000003
between Ireland and England Scotland

4025.81 --> 4031.42
dance that does cause that coastal area

4028.87 --> 4033.7
seems to be all chemtrail frayed but

4031.42 --> 4036.94
this just isn't normal this is no it's

4033.7 --> 4038.5299999999997
not it's official chafing

4036.94 --> 4040.21
I'll go racks back to the start of the

4038.53 --> 4041.8
video and I'll just pan around and show

4040.21 --> 4043.75
you the chemtrails that are up there you

4041.8 --> 4045.13
can see it you can see that all in

4043.75 --> 4049.24
there's a couple of planes just dropping

4045.13 --> 4051.37
some there and there's nothing now

4049.24 --> 4054.7
that's a contrail see he's not leaving

4051.37 --> 4056.3199999999997
here well I would this I would disagree

4054.7 --> 4059.0499999999997
with that because I think the different

4056.32 --> 4062.29
types from different planes they look at

4059.05 --> 4063.1000000000004
this that is it that that yeah that big

4062.29 --> 4065.5299999999997
boy right

4063.1 --> 4068.2599999999998
and that big rock you know the like

4065.53 --> 4071.0800000000004
forming an X you know that's like a one

4068.26 --> 4072.67
one big chemtrail and this is one big

4071.08 --> 4075.73
chemtrail going up there clap there's

4072.67 --> 4079.33
the center of the X mm-hmm you can see

4075.73 --> 4082.39
how it's spreading out you know right

4079.33 --> 4085.75
and yes just look at that look at that

4082.39 --> 4088.5699999999997
one there we go look at these look at

4085.75 --> 4089.89
these mhm and this is what's happened

4088.57 --> 4091.03
this is what this is what they're

4089.89 --> 4093.16
dropping out of the back of the plane

4091.03 --> 4094.51
and you can you know you can see all the

4093.16 --> 4097.41
planes started in the way in the

4094.51 --> 4099.91
background they're starting to drop one

4097.41 --> 4101.74
sulphur is frustrating but when you

4099.91 --> 4103.45
actually know that this is this is

4101.74 --> 4104.92
actually been acknowledged now this

4103.45 --> 4107.41
geoengineering

4104.92 --> 4108.7
it's a geoengineering is a fact it

4107.41 --> 4112.2699999999995
wasn't it was used to be a conspiracy

4108.7 --> 4114.5199999999995
theory and we used to get mocked all

4112.27 --> 4117.22
right but it's not really publicly and I

4114.52 --> 4119.14
mean it's fact they say they do it but

4117.22 --> 4120.91
they just don't talk about it and they

4119.14 --> 4123.01
don't say like oh yeah that is

4120.91 --> 4126.73
geoengineering no it's like yeah we're

4123.01 --> 4130.359
doing it but that doesn't exist it's

4126.73 --> 4131.95
crazy yeah I mean I just basically talk

4130.359 --> 4133.72
about this in my video and I'm basically

4131.95 --> 4135.339
the same look you know end of the day I

4133.72 --> 4137.2
had a channel at one time that was the

4135.339 --> 4140.109
same size as my channel right now and it

4137.2 --> 4143.58
was based purely on chemtrails over 400

4140.109 --> 4146.319
videos and I was exposing this [ __ ] from

4143.58 --> 4148.48
2011 you know so we're talking eight

4146.319 --> 4151.330000000001
years ago long before they even

4148.48 --> 4154.179999999999
acknowledged it and people vidiq you'll

4151.33 --> 4156.8189999999995
the idea of you know Kevin trails and

4154.18 --> 4158.799
geoengineering until it was actually

4156.819 --> 4161.02
released that hey you know what guess

4158.799 --> 4163.45
what we can do what we can do climate

4161.02 --> 4166.120000000001
management we can we can spray aerosols

4163.45 --> 4168.7
out the back of the plane and we can

4166.12 --> 4171.91
create cover to protect us from the Sun

4168.7 --> 4176.47
well hello and I've been testing it for

4171.91 --> 4178.93
decades year and that's 95 that's women

4176.47 --> 4182.14
95 s when the first chemtrails have been

4178.93 --> 4186.13
recorded to start up I would say the

4182.14 --> 4188.14
first time well I was born in 1975 and I

4186.13 --> 4192.93
was 17 years old when I saw my first

4188.14 --> 4195.47
country so that would be 1992 and rather

4192.93 --> 4198.14
they did do a cop

4195.47 --> 4200.87
both times but that's just one it like

4198.14 --> 4207.08
the real spraying the real program first

4200.87 --> 4209.3
started up in was it 1995 I'm correct

4207.08 --> 4211.9
that's when it really started to get

4209.3 --> 4213.89
everywhere it's also the same time very

4211.9 --> 4215.96
coincidentally when like the mobile

4213.89 --> 4220.58
phone revolution pretty much started to

4215.96 --> 4230.51
pop up so good morning guys wearing

4220.58 --> 4232.8099999999995
chocolate yeah you a sexy voice on today

4230.51 --> 4237.31
[Music]

4232.81 --> 4237.31
this is my sexy voice all the time

4242.02 --> 4250.9400000000005
sorry it's not been for you so yeah 1992

4248.39 --> 4252.56
yeah I mean guys I used to work how you

4250.94 --> 4254.54
know I was working from the age of maybe

4252.56 --> 4255.9800000000005
four or five with me ground up I was

4254.54 --> 4257.81
laboring for him as a kid you know that

4255.98 --> 4260.629999999999
you know just brought along onto a

4257.81 --> 4262.280000000001
building site by the age of nine or ten

4260.63 --> 4264.53
I was laying off those bricks and doing

4262.28 --> 4266.24
all that kind of stuff at weekends and

4264.53 --> 4267.92
stuff by the time I was 40 and I had my

4266.24 --> 4269.99
own window cleaning round of complete

4267.92 --> 4272.03
world I used to work on the weekends at

4269.99 --> 4273.429999999999
15 I started doing my own decorating

4272.03 --> 4275.2699999999995
with my father

4273.43 --> 4277.55
painting and decorating I was actually

4275.27 --> 4279.14
taking my GCSEs at the same time I was

4277.55 --> 4280.97
painting the house across the road on

4279.14 --> 4284.150000000001
corn it was a boom blow so I would

4280.97 --> 4286.37
change from my work clothes have a

4284.15 --> 4289.04
shower in in the bungalow get into my

4286.37 --> 4291.41
school uniform and underwent my GCSEs so

4289.04 --> 4293.21
when I say that I was outside a lot and

4291.41 --> 4295.01
was outside a lot even as a kid I was

4293.21 --> 4296.36
always outside playing I knew what the

4295.01 --> 4298.16
sky look like and then what clouds

4296.36 --> 4301.79
looked like I knew what the Sun looked

4298.16 --> 4305.51
like it was the Sun was orangey oranjee

4301.79 --> 4307.7
red now it's more white white is yellow

4305.51 --> 4311.12
you know it's completely different

4307.7 --> 4313.37
the clouds aren't the same because there

4311.12 --> 4315.17
isn't you know they determine these new

4313.37 --> 4317.45
clouds and the recently in the past

4315.17 --> 4319.55
about 10 years or so they classified a

4317.45 --> 4321.41
whole new bunch of cloud and the done

4319.55 --> 4323.33
that because that's the results of what

4321.41 --> 4325.43
these chemtrails look like at certain

4323.33 --> 4327.379
points that if they are they've created

4325.43 --> 4330.169
names for clouds that never

4327.379 --> 4331.999
existed when I was a kid it was just big

4330.169 --> 4334.82
fluffy white clouds that was all we ever

4331.999 --> 4336.889
got prop clouds not like this [ __ ] right

4334.82 --> 4339.139
and when I was seven right yeah before

4336.889 --> 4340.419
before that time there was serious

4339.139 --> 4344.2390000000005
clouds

4340.419 --> 4346.629
well now it's how can I remember from my

4344.239 --> 4350.659
from my science books it was like

4346.629 --> 4352.459
meteorology yeah maybe it's called

4350.659 --> 4354.709
Cirrus and they have coma less and come

4352.459 --> 4357.289
with Nimbus when the front yeah with the

4354.709 --> 4359.57
Cirrus there's no natural Cirrus going

4357.289 --> 4364.909
on a stormy night from out from their

4359.57 --> 4369.438999999999
desert now you got chemtrails the first

4364.909 --> 4372.259999999999
time I mean it's too blatantly not

4369.439 --> 4374.719
clouds you could see you could we ask

4372.26 --> 4376.579000000001
you the difference yeah I couldn't go

4374.719 --> 4379.55
outside now and I can do a video I can

4376.579 --> 4381.079
film and you will see that it looks like

4379.55 --> 4383.9890000000005
clouds but when you actually take a

4381.079 --> 4385.579
great look that the the the makeup of

4383.989 --> 4386.869
the cloud you zoom into it you can see

4385.579 --> 4389.09
that it is the remnants of the

4386.869 --> 4390.53
chemtrails you can still see it it's

4389.09 --> 4392.179
literally the remnants of the chemtrails

4390.53 --> 4393.978999999999
book people that nowadays are just

4392.179 --> 4396.709
walking down with a with a Hansel

4393.979 --> 4398.719
looking down on the mobile phones you

4396.709 --> 4402.349
know talking on the phones they're not

4398.719 --> 4403.789
looking up looking down all time and one

4402.349 --> 4405.409000000001
other thing I just want to just say just

4403.789 --> 4407.179
before we're going to further is I just

4405.409 --> 4409.28
went into detail about my childhood and

4407.179 --> 4412.159
how I was outside quite a lot my father

4409.28 --> 4414.409
who also worked out as an entire life

4412.159 --> 4416.509999999999
you know from being the age of 14 sent

4414.409 --> 4418.459
to it since his mom and his dad dad so

4416.51 --> 4420.349
my grandparents died and 14 he was

4418.459 --> 4421.699
literally on his own so he had to make

4420.349 --> 4424.099
ends meet and he became a painter

4421.699 --> 4426.138999999999
decorate at the age of 14 so he

4424.099 --> 4428.479
basically you know was outside his

4426.139 --> 4430.76
entire life taught me the trade until I

4428.479 --> 4433.729
was we said we separated our ways looks

4430.76 --> 4436.429
like 23 even when I was 23 but when we

4433.729 --> 4438.079000000001
was 7 when I was 17 and we saw up the

4436.429 --> 4439.039
scale and enough it looked like he was

4438.079 --> 4441.289
being honest it

4439.039 --> 4443.869
it was beautiful blue sky right

4441.289 --> 4445.849
beautiful blue skies sunny day nice

4443.869 --> 4448.129
weather I had the shirt off I was you

4445.849 --> 4450.919
know it must have been 28 degrees really

4448.129 --> 4452.78
nice day and we saw this the clouds we

4450.919 --> 4455.57
just saw what we saw this zip there's

4452.78 --> 4457.489
like a white line that just seems to go

4455.57 --> 4460.07
from one end of the sky so that we're

4457.489 --> 4461.57
all watching it go across the sky and

4460.07 --> 4464.45
it was literally like it was on a zip in

4461.57 --> 4467.36
the sky we said you know we realized it

4464.45 --> 4469.429999999999
was a plane but it was like we'd never

4467.36 --> 4471.049999999999
seen anything like it we down tools and

4469.43 --> 4472.79
we certainly watched that plane for ten

4471.05 --> 4475.1
or fifteen minutes as it went from one

4472.79 --> 4477.29
side of the sky to the other unzipping

4475.1 --> 4479.0
the look of the sky as we looked at it

4477.29 --> 4480.23
even that's that's the impression we got

4479.0 --> 4482.84
because we'd never seen anything like

4480.23 --> 4485.69
this now it's a regular occurrence this

4482.84 --> 4487.52
this on this particular video of here

4485.69 --> 4489.919999999999
where I where I thought where I was even

4487.52 --> 4492.4400000000005
on this this plane doing the exact same

4489.92 --> 4494.39
thing this is a similar but not

4492.44 --> 4497.599999999999
obviously not quite as dramatic as the

4494.39 --> 4499.01
one we saw but yeah this one here where

4497.6 --> 4501.05
it's going from one side of the scout's

4499.01 --> 4503.75
the other is similar but it isn't

4501.05 --> 4506.6900000000005
exactly the same but this is normal now

4503.75 --> 4509.84
where I was back in 1982 it wasn't you

4506.69 --> 4511.879999999999
know this wasn't the norm back then you

4509.84 --> 4517.28
know have blue sky didn't have this [ __ ]

4511.88 --> 4521.17
that's not a real that's no hazy soup no

4517.28 --> 4524.03
we had there was mist sometimes at most

4521.17 --> 4526.7300000000005
but there was no freakin hazy soup in

4524.03 --> 4529.009999999999
the high atmosphere but this line here

4526.73 --> 4530.99
this is what we saw this line opening up

4529.01 --> 4532.49
the sky book if you take away the haze

4530.99 --> 4534.62
on the left and the haze on the right

4532.49 --> 4536.2699999999995
and you have a beautiful blue sky and

4534.62 --> 4538.67
you've never seen anything like this

4536.27 --> 4540.410000000001
before in your entire life ever right

4538.67 --> 4542.21
it's gonna be something that you open

4540.41 --> 4545.93
your mouth at and go holy hell was that

4542.21 --> 4548.12
because we've never seen it right never

4545.93 --> 4551.33
ever seen it me my father had never ever

4548.12 --> 4552.62
seen anything like this right and now

4551.33 --> 4556.04
it's looking normal

4552.62 --> 4558.32
now it's normal you know and dude I've

4556.04 --> 4561.58
left my house and looked up and

4558.32 --> 4564.0199999999995
literally have seen like a tic-tac-toe

4561.58 --> 4568.1
board you know you know what tic-tac-toe

4564.02 --> 4571.580000000001
is the checkerboard type with the line

4568.1 --> 4573.950000000001
yes once yes yes guys play to connect

4571.58 --> 4576.5
all right remember at that time I've

4573.95 --> 4579.71
seen these checkerboard patterns up

4576.5 --> 4582.41
above my house remember that time it was

4579.71 --> 4585.26
a turtle mates when I literally life

4582.41 --> 4588.32
show it how the chemtrail was going

4585.26 --> 4592.400000000001
weird irregular patterns and then

4588.32 --> 4595.98
returned back us life

4592.4 --> 4596.61
it's ridiculous it's only I see them all

4595.98 --> 4599.07
the time

4596.61 --> 4601.139999999999
above my job I'll see regular planes

4599.07 --> 4603.9
just flying by and you see the regular

4601.14 --> 4606.3
contrails just disappear normally like

4603.9 --> 4607.86
they always used to and then every once

4606.3 --> 4610.74
in a while you'll see the other ones

4607.86 --> 4614.04
that show up and their contrails just

4610.74 --> 4616.11
stay right there all day and they spread

4614.04 --> 4618.69
out immediately and I needed to really

4616.11 --> 4625.98
seen it I don't exactly Mount Lee

4618.69 --> 4628.0199999999995
started yeah I was I was on break at

4625.98 --> 4630.12
lunch and I told you look look up in the

4628.02 --> 4634.200000000001
sky you see those planes you see that

4630.12 --> 4636.18
those contrails quote-unquote told them

4634.2 --> 4638.61
watch while we come back outside for

4636.18 --> 4640.9800000000005
lunch later those will have turned into

4638.61 --> 4643.32
clouds I'll bet I'll bet my next

4640.98 --> 4645.66
paycheck on that you just looked at me

4643.32 --> 4646.639999999999
like well I will be a little crazy like

4645.66 --> 4650.13
yeah I know right

4646.64 --> 4653.43
sure enough go back inside I come back

4650.13 --> 4656.76
outside for a break the car the whole

4653.43 --> 4661.26
sky is cloudy and he just looks at me

4656.76 --> 4663.42
like yo that's crazy like dude it's not

4661.26 --> 4664.860000000001
a joke they're doing some dumb [ __ ] up

4663.42 --> 4669.96
there I don't know what the [ __ ] they're

4664.86 --> 4671.089999999999
doing but it it's not cool cuz that's

4669.96 --> 4674.28
not normal

4671.09 --> 4676.650000000001
yeah something that comes out of a plane

4674.28 --> 4682.889999999999
should not turn into what looks like a

4676.65 --> 4686.549999999999
cloud that's normal I think there's

4682.89 --> 4690.54
something very wrong with you if if you

4686.55 --> 4693.18
research how much water is held in a

4690.54 --> 4697.29
typical cloud right it's something

4693.18 --> 4699.39
ridiculous like 20 lakes worth of water

4697.29 --> 4701.88
is held in the typical cloud now a

4699.39 --> 4704.25
typical cloud will look like just what

4701.88 --> 4707.16
the chem fog I'm gonna call it camp fog

4704.25 --> 4709.2
looks like so it wipes out the sky it

4707.16 --> 4712.349999999999
just looks like it's complete cloud

4709.2 --> 4716.3099999999995
right when you look at planes and how

4712.35 --> 4717.990000000001
much fuel they have in and then they say

4716.31 --> 4720.72
that the reason you're looking at this

4717.99 --> 4724.889999999999
this stuff in the sky is that just the

4720.72 --> 4725.67
remnants the the residual water vapor

4724.89 --> 4729.179
from

4725.67 --> 4731.58
from from the fuel well how much fuel is

4729.179 --> 4733.32
actually pumped out of the plane in what

4731.58 --> 4734.64
probably 10 minutes for the time it

4733.32 --> 4736.679
takes to go from one side to the other

4734.64 --> 4738.51
and how much water vapor is there

4736.679 --> 4741.4490000000005
because I'm telling you now it won't

4738.51 --> 4743.429
even come close to anything like 10 Lake

4741.449 --> 4746.009999999999
Worth and even if you had a hundred

4743.429 --> 4748.5
planes flying over it wouldn't so the

4746.01 --> 4751.35
idea that you know that it's just water

4748.5 --> 4753.719
vapor that's blocking out the Sun and it

4751.35 --> 4757.1900000000005
doesn't make any circular yeah water

4753.719 --> 4762.179
vapor doesn't wave out like a dust cloud

4757.19 --> 4765.989
it either like certainly starts to form

4762.179 --> 4769.56
a cloud and then just absorbs the

4765.989 --> 4772.199
surrounding water or it dissolves in it

4769.56 --> 4774.330000000001
if the the air surrounding it actually

4772.199 --> 4777.54
lacks water and that's how water it

4774.33 --> 4779.75
doesn't just oh look a little cloud and

4777.54 --> 4782.82
then suddenly it starts wavering out

4779.75 --> 4785.67
with clear turbulence patterns almost

4782.82 --> 4787.92
like sand dunes from all the air up

4785.67 --> 4790.71
there they wave out in a specific type

4787.92 --> 4795.17
of pattern to the side right that does

4790.71 --> 4797.64
never ever happen to water vapor to

4795.17 --> 4804.6900000000005
visible fog water vapour like clouds

4797.64 --> 4806.280000000001
never happens ever yeah it's [ __ ] so

4804.69 --> 4810.36
yeah I just wait to talk about that

4806.28 --> 4814.86
because like I say I have a feeling that

4810.36 --> 4817.5
this this non visibility over the water

4814.86 --> 4820.5599999999995
is is a buildup of the remnants the

4817.5 --> 4823.469
particulates that are in the in the

4820.56 --> 4825.900000000001
chemtrails and what's scary is that if

4823.469 --> 4829.02
we're seeing no more than say six miles

4825.9 --> 4830.969
from an elevation of 50 feet we can't

4829.02 --> 4834.179
see any further than that that shows

4830.969 --> 4836.25
that the density of the particulates is

4834.179 --> 4838.5
far greater than we ever thought

4836.25 --> 4840.48
because what when I'm standing next to

4838.5 --> 4843.0
the water I'm thinking well I'm

4840.48 --> 4845.218999999999
breathing in quite a lot of this [ __ ] if

4843.0 --> 4847.199
I can't see more than six miles due to

4845.219 --> 4854.77
the build-up of these particulates how

4847.199 --> 4859.629999999999
much you might actually inhale in well

4854.77 --> 4859.63
small quantities that build up over time

4859.66 --> 4866.84
you you probably be breathing just as

4863.33 --> 4871.36
much chemical residue talking of which

4866.84 --> 4871.360000000001
there's one spraying right now Thanks

4871.66 --> 4878.72
you should be I'm gonna go out and film

4876.38 --> 4881.12
right now right but a film right now

4878.72 --> 4882.650000000001
give me five minutes I'll be back I'm

4881.12 --> 4884.66
going to show you what I've recorded one

4882.65 --> 4887.57
set this is like the first one that's

4884.66 --> 4890.9
what we're doing here I'm really pissed

4887.57 --> 4893.599999999999
off maybe they're doing it to punish me

4890.9 --> 4895.219999999999
for talking about them oh you want to

4893.6 --> 4897.05
talk about chemtrails here are your

4895.22 --> 4898.64
chemtrails if you keep on talking about

4897.05 --> 4902.900000000001
we're gonna chem you to death

4898.64 --> 4905.660000000001
maybe that's the new policy hey Arwen

4902.9 --> 4908.719999999999
have you ever seen the photograph with a

4905.66 --> 4910.07
bunch of superimposed trails or it's

4908.72 --> 4916.13
like multiple trails in multiple

4910.07 --> 4919.219999999999
directions yeah plenty made them in 2008

4916.13 --> 4923.81
even I have old photographs we said lots

4919.22 --> 4925.79
of chemtrails right so would you agree

4923.81 --> 4928.22
that probably in principle if you had

4925.79 --> 4930.739
enough accurate contrails traveling in

4928.22 --> 4932.45
certain directions over a time lapse you

4930.739 --> 4936.049999999999
could actually have an accurate grid map

4932.45 --> 4939.2
of the perspective of the sky the grid

4936.05 --> 4941.6
map of what like you would have grid

4939.2 --> 4944.66
lines in the sky that would show the

4941.6 --> 4952.43
perspective map of how the sky curves in

4944.66 --> 4954.95
your perspective yeah but only up until

4952.43 --> 4956.72
a certain point because yeah it blurs

4954.95 --> 4960.739
out if it goes far enough into the

4956.72 --> 4962.96
distance because yet the haze you know

4960.739 --> 4966.86
it means it also calls like a vert

4962.96 --> 4968.92
clarity so yeah right but if you had

4966.86 --> 4971.54
enough if you had enough ground-based

4968.92 --> 4974.0
observation points you could stitch them

4971.54 --> 4977.32
all together well and pretty much have

4974.0 --> 4981.59
an accurate perspective map of that

4977.32 --> 4983.48
height from any observation point if you

4981.59 --> 4986.12
can keep track of the planes you can

4983.48 --> 4988.04
figure it out that way I've I've seen

4986.12 --> 4991.01
chemtrail planes

4988.04 --> 4993.739
that would in a clear sky move like

4991.01 --> 4997.09
straight over me into the distance and

4993.739 --> 5000.339999999999
then I would literally see them go like

4997.09 --> 5002.9800000000005
yeah almost like turn a corner and it's

5000.34 --> 5006.93
like every first optical slant up there

5002.98 --> 5010.78
they would just go fold into the horizon

5006.93 --> 5013.570000000001
so there is perspective effects applying

5010.78 --> 5018.34
definitely with what what we see up

5013.57 --> 5020.92
there but if there's just too many grids

5018.34 --> 5022.33
can feel planes then eventually

5020.92 --> 5026.05
everything will just blur out you won't

5022.33 --> 5029.89
be able to see it anymore if you just

5026.05 --> 5032.320000000001
see one plane you know into the distance

5029.89 --> 5035.79
then you can already see like an every

5032.32 --> 5038.88
first optical slant from perspective

5035.79 --> 5040.84
it's interesting

5038.88 --> 5042.43
sorry chuckle you were gonna say

5040.84 --> 5044.08
something well imagine what that would

5042.43 --> 5047.530000000001
look like if the chemtrails were

5044.08 --> 5052.57
actually bending down and following the

5047.53 --> 5057.489
current some people believe they do like

5052.57 --> 5060.88
I called I remember I don't know I've

5057.489 --> 5063.9
never actually seen a video evidence or

5060.88 --> 5066.55
photographic evidence that shows any

5063.9 --> 5069.0
object following the curvature whether

5066.55 --> 5074.8
it be a meteor supposedly an airplane

5069.0 --> 5076.03
pretty much anything you know what I'm

5074.8 --> 5079.87
thinking now

5076.03 --> 5082.66
the we're talking about ball logic right

5079.87 --> 5085.78
so if you have the earth as a ball yet

5082.66 --> 5087.76
like super high altitude very fast

5085.78 --> 5090.5199999999995
planes well the faster the planes would

5087.76 --> 5092.89
get the more trouble they would have

5090.52 --> 5095.59
remaining in the atmosphere under those

5092.89 --> 5097.4800000000005
speeds because they'd have to adapt to

5095.59 --> 5099.67
the rotation and they would be naturally

5097.48 --> 5101.41
inclined to straighten out and then

5099.67 --> 5105.84
eventually eject themselves out of the

5101.41 --> 5105.84
atmosphere that never happened does it

5106.08 --> 5111.16
right but keep in mind the amount of

5108.88 --> 5113.4400000000005
thrust they say is necessary for a

5111.16 --> 5116.26
rocket or the Space Shuttle to leave

5113.44 --> 5118.739
orbit like the amount of energy

5116.26 --> 5122.2390000000005
necessary because it has to

5118.739 --> 5125.489
to fight escape escape flirt oh yeah of

5122.239 --> 5127.468999999999
25,000 miles per hour right they need to

5125.489 --> 5130.07
get through that gravity barrier that's

5127.469 --> 5132.75
supposedly holding in the gas restaurant

5130.07 --> 5136.679
but nobody talks about it's just a

5132.75 --> 5139.29
gradual thing they know it's a gravity

5136.679 --> 5141.0
beary dinos yeah that's only 5,000 they

5139.29 --> 5142.739
have no choice if they want to uphold

5141.0 --> 5144.33
that story of gravity keeping all that

5142.739 --> 5147.03
gas pressure in they're gonna have to

5144.33 --> 5149.88
have like a secondary einsteinium new

5147.03 --> 5151.8
mystery effects like a secondary gravity

5149.88 --> 5158.159000000001
side effect that will create a barrier

5151.8 --> 5161.400000000001
allowing atmospheres on planets so they

5158.159 --> 5168.69
have no choice been telling him for a

5161.4 --> 5170.46
year well I brought up that a gas

5168.69 --> 5173.25
pressure without a container argument on

5170.46 --> 5176.219
one Chad I was on and the response for

5173.25 --> 5177.659
the proof of it was I can't remember

5176.219 --> 5180.87
what it was called but it was called

5177.659 --> 5182.19
like the super toriel magnetosphere or

5180.87 --> 5184.94
something it was an experiment done

5182.19 --> 5190.379999999999
where they contained a gas within an

5184.94 --> 5193.199
electromagnetic force field sort of I've

5190.38 --> 5197.179
heard of cry it's something about that

5193.199 --> 5200.009999999999
and so uh so nothing like on earth right

5197.179 --> 5202.29
well they were trying to emulate the

5200.01 --> 5204.12
gravity barrier yeah they were trying to

5202.29 --> 5206.04
emulate or that he was trying to show

5204.12 --> 5207.57
that gas pressure without a container

5206.04 --> 5210.9
and I'm like okay so what we have is a

5207.57 --> 5215.61
containment field that contains gas yet

5210.9 --> 5217.799999999999
it's not a container not it's it is

5215.61 --> 5220.349999999999
because I bet you they didn't do that

5217.8 --> 5222.659000000001
with inside of a vacuum chamber because

5220.35 --> 5226.05
then it wouldn't hold right but it's

5222.659 --> 5228.0
still a container regardless well if

5226.05 --> 5230.52
it's in a vacuum chamber and it would

5228.0 --> 5232.98
stick outside of the vacuum then you

5230.52 --> 5235.969
would have something but I'm proposing

5232.98 --> 5239.5199999999995
that that is physically impossible to do

5235.969 --> 5240.9
because the need for a gas pressure to

5239.52 --> 5242.55
find its equilibrium within the

5240.9 --> 5247.259999999999
container before any kind of gradient

5242.55 --> 5250.56
would set in is maybe infinitely

5247.26 --> 5251.4890000000005
stronger than any kind of force that can

5250.56 --> 5254.610000000001
be mastered by

5251.489 --> 5257.73
physical interactions but maybe I'm

5254.61 --> 5259.558999999999
exaggerating a little now hey guys I'm

5257.73 --> 5263.518999999999
back you'll to see the video I've just

5259.559 --> 5265.17
taken sure yeah pop me on the screen and

5263.519 --> 5267.4800000000005
just show everybody all right

5265.17 --> 5270.3
it's only a minute longer so so yeah

5267.48 --> 5272.669999999999
minions certain little yeah

5270.3 --> 5274.53
I'm just shot this right now just run

5272.67 --> 5277.139
out to the front door just started

5274.53 --> 5291.929
recording I don't need to take a look at

5277.139 --> 5296.3
this yeah it looks pretty bad Randy it's

5291.929 --> 5296.3
a Californian level spring

5298.98 --> 5302.08
[Music]

5302.379 --> 5311.59
and the rollout how many things you got

5305.289 --> 5313.3
appeared at once a lot I would just look

5311.59 --> 5320.289
at that glad is that three planes just

5313.3 --> 5324.179
know Jesus look at it as all can mark em

5320.289 --> 5324.179
trail planes then satellites up there

5328.889 --> 5333.939
yeah just thought I'd show you this I

5332.8 --> 5335.979
mean look at that one there look at that

5333.939 --> 5337.959000000001
one this this that one slowly breaking

5335.979 --> 5341.579000000001
up can you see that one's still breaking

5337.959 --> 5344.59
up waving out yeah expanding and

5341.579 --> 5348.6089999999995
eventually it will just create another

5344.59 --> 5350.169
very miniscule layer of mist so to speak

5348.609 --> 5352.869000000001
yeah and then the more that they keep

5350.169 --> 5354.849
piling on eventually that minuscule

5352.869 --> 5358.379
amount of mist will become a thick layer

5354.849 --> 5360.909000000001
of mist that is mistaken for clouds and

5358.379 --> 5363.07
it's not clouds it's just block it out

5360.909 --> 5369.07
the blue blocking out of this song for

5363.07 --> 5370.959
whatever reason it's dust that's

5369.07 --> 5373.619
literally what it is whatever that dust

5370.959 --> 5378.059
may be comprised of it is dust it's

5373.619 --> 5380.289
solid matter fine dust of some kind

5378.059 --> 5381.999
because it can't be anything else or

5380.289 --> 5389.768999999999
otherwise it wouldn't be responding like

5381.999 --> 5391.869
this so disgusting whatever it is and

5389.769 --> 5395.8
this is what we have with on a daily

5391.869 --> 5402.369
basis I mean sucks man

5395.8 --> 5406.05
I can't rally over it's not gone but

5402.369 --> 5410.018999999999
it's not too bad overall I don't know

5406.05 --> 5411.820000000001
I've seen it a lot worse yeah I mean the

5410.019 --> 5413.829000000001
thing is like I asked you before I said

5411.82 --> 5415.959
you know how far away do you live from

5413.829 --> 5417.398999999999
the water and I'm wondering if it's

5415.959 --> 5418.719
because we live near the water I mean

5417.399 --> 5421.689
obviously we live near an airport

5418.719 --> 5423.76
Manchester Liverpool you know they're

5421.689 --> 5426.219
too far away maybe we just live in a

5423.76 --> 5428.909000000001
direction where we have a lot of traffic

5426.219 --> 5431.229
you know a lot of playing traffic well

5428.909 --> 5435.398999999999
you know if you don't live in an area

5431.229 --> 5435.91
like that right it could depend a bit on

5435.399 --> 5438.13
the

5435.91 --> 5440.19
with directions of the winds because

5438.13 --> 5444.7
what I do realize is that the spraying

5440.19 --> 5447.4
in general they really do a mostly for

5444.7 --> 5449.71
big city areas and what they do

5447.4 --> 5455.5
sometimes is spray somewhere which seems

5449.71 --> 5458.38
off like right over some urban or what

5455.5 --> 5461.2
is it some countryside but then the wind

5458.38 --> 5464.77
will carry it and as it approaches like

5461.2 --> 5466.51
I'll yeah like closer down the winds

5464.77 --> 5468.13
that has brought it right over a big

5466.51 --> 5471.37
city and so they timed this very

5468.13 --> 5473.62
carefully how the chemtrails drift where

5471.37 --> 5478.45
they land and they always try to aim for

5473.62 --> 5480.28
big cities so me yeah maybe because it's

5478.45 --> 5483.25
being sprayed there if they do it

5480.28 --> 5487.42
because it all eventually lands on big

5483.25 --> 5490.09
city surrounding areas possibly Omega

5487.42 --> 5493.9
where they really really ate I love man

5490.09 --> 5495.13
oh maybe they really hate my channel and

5493.9 --> 5497.849999999999
just don't want me going down there with

5495.13 --> 5503.08
ap1000 this year it's does happy night

5497.85 --> 5505.51
it might be a bit of a stretch but just

5503.08 --> 5507.97
they probably think it's funny though

5505.51 --> 5512.59
they probably don't like you a lot for

5507.97 --> 5515.41
doing what you do well you know you know

5512.59 --> 5516.9400000000005
you need you need to expose the flat

5515.41 --> 5518.11
water and that's something else you know

5516.94 --> 5522.849999999999
I mean I've been talking about recently

5518.11 --> 5524.5599999999995
in shallow water so shallow regions

5522.85 --> 5527.26
where I live dog so we've got we've got

5524.56 --> 5529.660000000001
shallow regions we don't have any real

5527.26 --> 5532.54
depth more than perhaps 80 meters or so

5529.66 --> 5535.24
from here to the Isle of Man that's

5532.54 --> 5538.36
that's fairly you know as as far as

5535.24 --> 5542.38
deaths go in regards to the oceans

5538.36 --> 5548.19
that's a long expanse of shallowness

5542.38 --> 5550.900000000001
well it's quite how would you say

5548.19 --> 5555.61
revealing that we can see across this

5550.9 --> 5557.0199999999995
flat shallow area quite well normally

5555.61 --> 5560.049999999999
you know I mean you can see the Welcome

5557.02 --> 5563.14
Mountains you can see wind turbines that

5560.05 --> 5565.18
are at least twice as high as you would

5563.14 --> 5566.860000000001
expect it's those of low curvature in

5565.18 --> 5568.54
the way then he got opposite

5566.86 --> 5570.75
barrow-in-furness you but you've got all

5568.54 --> 5570.75
these

5571.03 --> 5576.82
great reasons for this location to be

5573.82 --> 5578.59
praying for seeing very far and I

5576.82 --> 5581.199
thought that down to being due to the

5578.59 --> 5583.389
fact that the water isn't very deep here

5581.199 --> 5586.509999999999
well as soon as you go to the deeper

5583.389 --> 5588.969
ocean and he get the bigger waves and he

5586.51 --> 5591.789000000001
got you know the Shelf you know as it

5588.969 --> 5593.409
drops off down into the real deep ocean

5591.789 --> 5595.179
that's when he seemed to get the

5593.409 --> 5597.61
blockage no that's when he seemed to see

5595.179 --> 5601.26
bolts that are hidden behind a wall of

5597.61 --> 5603.489
water you know you know from one

5601.26 --> 5607.769
understanding of how the topography of

5603.489 --> 5611.459
the land works out is that that shelf is

5607.769 --> 5614.769
creating some kind of localized bulge

5611.459 --> 5617.53
due to the pressure of the water being

5614.769 --> 5620.559
forced in and released due to the tag

5617.53 --> 5624.728999999999
movement and anything beyond that

5620.559 --> 5627.219
localized bulge will obviously be behind

5624.729 --> 5629.05
a bulge really Frank yeah sure

5627.219 --> 5631.869
it will be a pressure bulge and it will

5629.05 --> 5634.51
be localized to the topography of the

5631.869 --> 5636.938999999999
ocean bed or maybe it could be called a

5634.51 --> 5639.88
coastal bulge because it is always gonna

5636.939 --> 5642.309
be on the coast and because it is higher

5639.88 --> 5645.61
that causes a kind of the effect at the

5642.309 --> 5648.429
same time right so it is coastal and the

5645.61 --> 5651.28
whole bulge you've also got taken to the

5648.429 --> 5654.28
fact into account as well that for the

5651.28 --> 5657.459
most part these deep oceans have very

5654.28 --> 5659.17
you know the waves at the top quiet high

5657.459 --> 5662.829
you know he's talking anywhere from 10

5659.17 --> 5666.13
to 15 feet normally during storms they

5662.829 --> 5668.17
go that it's 40 feet in you know and so

5666.13 --> 5669.939
when you're going into the deep Atlantic

5668.17 --> 5671.909
in the store know these guys that go out

5669.939 --> 5673.809
on the boats they don't get a joyride

5671.909 --> 5675.159
it's not like they're going out and

5673.809 --> 5676.479
they're just going to just go up on a

5675.159 --> 5678.579
cross in and it's going to be nice and

5676.479 --> 5681.219
calm you know they're encountering big

5678.579 --> 5682.749
waves so the chances of you know anybody

5681.219 --> 5684.099
being able to try and do anything

5682.749 --> 5686.32
optically out there is gonna be

5684.099 --> 5688.959
impossible then you've got the localized

5686.32 --> 5691.808999999999
bulging that happens Joe you know due to

5688.959 --> 5694.03
the the tagil pressures on the

5691.809 --> 5697.360000000001
topography of the land and when you take

5694.03 --> 5699.82
all that into account you seem to

5697.36 --> 5701.889
realize this is how the able to deceive

5699.82 --> 5702.429
us you know this is how they got away

5701.889 --> 5703.3
with it

5702.429 --> 5704.8
on the other

5703.3 --> 5707.26
and you make a very good argument that

5704.8 --> 5712.54
water is not actually flat this way

5707.26 --> 5715.21
oh no I agree water isn't flat it is if

5712.54 --> 5718.0
this weight will always find its level

5715.21 --> 5719.89
it may not in a dress though it will

5718.0 --> 5721.75
always find its level unless it be

5719.89 --> 5723.85
having a force acted upon it

5721.75 --> 5726.73
right right so tides are definitely

5723.85 --> 5729.34
forces so if you're in a bath if you run

5726.73 --> 5730.75
a bath and then you see Tony tap off and

5729.34 --> 5733.12
you leave it for 10 minutes that water

5730.75 --> 5735.7
will be completely flat right if you

5733.12 --> 5738.37
drop a pebble in the water then it won't

5735.7 --> 5740.53
stay flat it will stay ripoli for

5738.37 --> 5742.8099999999995
another two or three minutes until it

5740.53 --> 5744.34
eventually found its level however what

5742.81 --> 5746.8
you've got with the oceans is you've got

5744.34 --> 5750.22
a constant movement a constant a

5746.8 --> 5752.53
constant water migration constant water

5750.22 --> 5755.02
migration and also it's actually not the

5752.53 --> 5757.0
waters that the water itself doesn't

5755.02 --> 5760.06
move is the vibration between each

5757.0 --> 5763.75
particle that moves it tumbling over so

5760.06 --> 5766.240000000001
so you know step movement it's just

5763.75 --> 5768.07
pressure division it balances out finds

5766.24 --> 5770.98
an equilibrium within the body of water

5768.07 --> 5774.19
and then it just migrates as a whole

5770.98 --> 5775.719999999999
unit almost it's slight like the

5774.19 --> 5777.25
undercurrent does one thing and the

5775.72 --> 5782.83
upper Kern does the other thing it's

5777.25 --> 5784.48
almost like an amoeba oh sorry yeah and

5782.83 --> 5787.96
the way I'm gonna sort of explain this

5784.48 --> 5790.089999999999
is like you could be well how would you

5787.96 --> 5792.19
explain it and cuz Brenda's just put a

5790.09 --> 5796.39
question in here so she doesn't so now

5792.19 --> 5799.299999999999
we have bendy water well it's all of you

5796.39 --> 5802.51
military have bendy water we have all G

5799.3 --> 5806.2
water and that's due to pressure so if

5802.51 --> 5810.9400000000005
you're pushing something so so let's put

5806.2 --> 5813.25
it another way right if you have a ramp

5810.94 --> 5815.95
and you try and push some water up the

5813.25 --> 5818.68
ramp it's going to get higher up the

5815.95 --> 5820.33
ramp right obviously because you put

5818.68 --> 5822.34
force behind it as you're pushing off

5820.33 --> 5823.84
the ramp right well eventually it comes

5822.34 --> 5826.39
back so it's not so that's like the

5823.84 --> 5829.42
tides but you're going to get a bulge

5826.39 --> 5830.92
you will get a bulge and it happens and

5829.42 --> 5832.87
it's a fact and it's actually a

5830.92 --> 5834.49
well-known documented fact that we're

5832.87 --> 5835.88
actually looking into right now

5834.49 --> 5839.0
and

5835.88 --> 5841.219
and you know this is it's really

5839.0 --> 5843.71
interesting that even the smallest

5841.219 --> 5846.53
amount of localized bulge due to

5843.71 --> 5850.19
pressure of the tides will obscure

5846.53 --> 5852.53
objects yeah you know a four to four you

5850.19 --> 5857.08
know eventually every little bit close

5852.53 --> 5860.929
by will obstruct a lock the further way

5857.08 --> 5863.69
well unless the felt in your own in our

5860.929 --> 5867.2300000000005
in New Zealand somewhere and it's ten

5863.69 --> 5869.48
miles out to to the shelf of weight

5867.23 --> 5871.549999999999
drops off into the ocean and then you've

5869.48 --> 5875.08
got the localized balls back into ten

5871.55 --> 5877.34
miles and I suppose that bulge causes a

5875.08 --> 5879.92
obstruction that say a couple of feet

5877.34 --> 5882.5
right well obviously the inverse square

5879.92 --> 5883.9400000000005
law of bolts and things like that there

5882.5 --> 5885.44
are already at ten miles away it's going

5883.94 --> 5888.169999999999
to be pretty small about at that

5885.44 --> 5889.79
distance right but if you've got that if

5888.17 --> 5891.62
you place that bowl at fifteen miles

5889.79 --> 5895.159
away right and you've got a two-foot

5891.62 --> 5898.219
[ __ ] ten miles away then do you know

5895.159 --> 5901.638999999999
it's gonna hide it it's going to hide it

5898.219 --> 5906.159
you know it's just a simple arithmetic

5901.639 --> 5908.719
you know mathematical arithmetic and the

5906.159 --> 5912.739
more we understand about the topography

5908.719 --> 5914.12
of the land underneath the water and

5912.739 --> 5916.3099999999995
where these thing where these

5914.12 --> 5918.5599999999995
observations are taken you know my

5916.31 --> 5923.030000000001
observation where I take them here we

5918.56 --> 5925.610000000001
have pretty shallow region of ocean

5923.03 --> 5928.82
right pretty shallow and we see a lot a

5925.61 --> 5930.889
long distant tray but what you do get

5928.82 --> 5933.139
the globe is that put videos out that

5930.889 --> 5935.54
show about hit both hole hidden by

5933.139 --> 5938.150000000001
clearly water you know you can clearly

5935.54 --> 5939.409
tell it's water and then when you look

5938.15 --> 5941.659
into the products of Agra fee of the

5939.409 --> 5943.879999999999
lamda found there's probably a really

5941.659 --> 5945.71
deep shelf in the way between between

5943.88 --> 5949.37
the observation and them and that will

5945.71 --> 5951.62
cause a localized bulge yep you know

5949.37 --> 5952.07
play you know if you if you've got a

5951.62 --> 5954.44
river

5952.07 --> 5958.46
you got a Riveter and you put a big

5954.44 --> 5960.32
stone in the river right and the water

5958.46 --> 5962.9890000000005
rushes over it you're gonna get a

5960.32 --> 5967.04
localized bulge where it goes over the

5962.989 --> 5969.08
over the stone right yep it's just the

5967.04 --> 5969.44
same with the tags flowing a turbulence

5969.08 --> 5971.449
yeah

5969.44 --> 5974.928999999999
indeed it's it's kind of funny though

5971.449 --> 5979.759999999999
that you especially are now stumbling

5974.929 --> 5981.83
upon this coastal bulge concept because

5979.76 --> 5983.27
really early on before we were starting

5981.83 --> 5986.389
to figure out perspective and everything

5983.27 --> 5989.719
and I came up with the optical slant you

5986.389 --> 5991.76
were kind of like try or you and Riley

5989.719 --> 5994.52
and Nathan we're kind of like trying out

5991.76 --> 5996.2300000000005
but like yeah but limited viewing angle

5994.52 --> 5997.820000000001
so a wave in front is obscure in the

5996.23 --> 6000.159
back and that didn't make sense with

5997.82 --> 6002.0199999999995
some water footage we even got some

6000.159 --> 6006.489
really good shots it's really funny that

6002.02 --> 6007.929
in retrospect that kind of holds up even

6006.489 --> 6010.57
though we didn't really know that there

6007.929 --> 6013.389
is a significant difference in the water

6010.57 --> 6016.299999999999
high due to the coastal bolts it's funny

6013.389 --> 6018.34
how that worked out we didn't even know

6016.3 --> 6019.6900000000005
basically what we were seeing but we

6018.34 --> 6022.4800000000005
were already getting it kind of right

6019.69 --> 6026.138999999999
but then yeah there's so much more to it

6022.48 --> 6029.049999999999
eventually that we stumbled upon so it's

6026.139 --> 6034.389
good to know an extra new detail just

6029.05 --> 6046.0
about how the world the tides are caused

6034.389 --> 6052.03
by the moon's gravity yeah I love to see

6046.0 --> 6053.94
like that modeled out reenacted like

6052.03 --> 6058.389
well how about any independent variable

6053.94 --> 6060.61
just to just say okay let's just say

6058.389 --> 6068.139
this is just saying oh it's caused by

6060.61 --> 6071.44
the moon because the moon freakin passes

6068.139 --> 6074.889
over once every what is it 25 hours or

6071.44 --> 6078.659
something or 24 and it was anything's

6074.889 --> 6081.37
almost a day once but yet the tides are

6078.659 --> 6083.44
probably at least twice a day if they

6081.37 --> 6087.769
are there at all even though it might be

6083.44 --> 6090.409
the same body of water so yeah

6087.769 --> 6092.869000000001
if you're gonna actually test proof that

6090.409 --> 6095.598999999999
with the moon being visible over you

6092.869 --> 6098.15
during a tide and then cross-reference

6095.599 --> 6101.179
it I'll bet you it's gonna be a giant

6098.15 --> 6104.558999999999
giant mess that doesn't match up in the

6101.179 --> 6107.51
slightest but that's just me

6104.559 --> 6109.150000000001
might be wrong maybe the moon does cause

6107.51 --> 6114.71
the tides

6109.15 --> 6117.379999999999
nah no not with the gravitational pull

6114.71 --> 6119.09
that they're asserting it does how is it

6117.38 --> 6121.849
gonna do that when it's actually gonna

6119.09 --> 6124.4890000000005
be tides twice how is it gonna do that

6121.849 --> 6128.2390000000005
from passing out for once that doesn't

6124.489 --> 6130.848999999999
make any sense especially because it's

6128.239 --> 6133.968999999999
not like a swing of the pendulum rise

6130.849 --> 6135.4400000000005
and then falling no it's pretty much all

6133.969 --> 6137.539
day pretty much the same and then

6135.44 --> 6139.19
suddenly it starts to rise and then it

6137.539 --> 6144.59
falls again and it's pretty much the

6139.19 --> 6146.869
same all day until the next so that's

6144.59 --> 6149.059
not like it's being pulled and being let

6146.869 --> 6150.558999999999
go and being pulled and let go which you

6149.059 --> 6152.360000000001
could suggest that the moon would be

6150.559 --> 6154.570000000001
going around in a cycle and then that

6152.36 --> 6157.159
would cause the water to go up and down

6154.57 --> 6159.289
twice or something you could imagine

6157.159 --> 6161.42
that but the thing is that's not how the

6159.289 --> 6166.4
ties are actually working the rise in

6161.42 --> 6169.03
the fall so I bet I've set this image on

6166.4 --> 6171.619
along with a bunch of information to

6169.03 --> 6174.999
hopefully somebody that's going to

6171.619 --> 6180.53
respond to me because he right into our

6174.999 --> 6183.469
planet and what we're finding is that in

6180.53 --> 6186.44
the location say well you know we've got

6183.469 --> 6188.9
some recent global earth parent crews

6186.44 --> 6192.379999999999
and what we're looking at across here is

6188.9 --> 6194.179
I've got a distance here am i oh oh I

6192.38 --> 6196.28
want to spoil it for a second I'll let

6194.179 --> 6199.4890000000005
you continue but yeah if if the layout

6196.28 --> 6201.409
of a coast is going to be like this then

6199.489 --> 6204.589999999999
if the in the back at the 500 meter

6201.409 --> 6206.299999999999
depth if it would move like ohmmeter

6204.59 --> 6209.059
let's say it would be pushed aside for a

6206.3 --> 6210.769
meter that would bring a huge bulge on

6209.059 --> 6212.719
land because there's a huge amount of

6210.769 --> 6215.09
mass being this of water being displaced

6212.719 --> 6219.199
and forced upon that very tiny space

6215.09 --> 6219.89
there exactly yes so when you go let's

6219.199 --> 6221.5599999999995
suppose

6219.89 --> 6224.12
the tide movement coming in this way

6221.56 --> 6226.400000000001
you've got a 500 meter depth this way

6224.12 --> 6229.19
there's only an 8 mile distant track so

6226.4 --> 6232.009999999999
from the 19 meter depth eeeh to the 500

6229.19 --> 6234.469999999999
meter depth is only 8 miles right so

6232.01 --> 6237.5
you've got that ninj a huge amount of

6234.47 --> 6239.75
volume of water with the tide pushing in

6237.5 --> 6241.61
from right to left and it's got to go

6239.75 --> 6242.93
into these shallows it's got to go into

6241.61 --> 6245.42
these shallows but it's also

6242.93 --> 6248.06
encountering this this obstruction this

6245.42 --> 6249.83
Ridge so what you're going to in effect

6248.06 --> 6253.04
what's going to happen is is is this tag

6249.83 --> 6255.5
pushes in you know how much that mean

6253.04 --> 6259.33
he'll look up this in this localized

6255.5 --> 6261.76
area here we're going to get a area of

6259.33 --> 6265.16
pressured water that's going to be

6261.76 --> 6267.68
bulged up right in this location because

6265.16 --> 6269.87
he has to you've got all this pressure

6267.68 --> 6272.240000000001
pushing in from the right to the left

6269.87 --> 6275.3
so in this location here you know in

6272.24 --> 6278.54
this the way this is so I don't think

6275.3 --> 6281.360000000001
it's good to both sides right yes it has

6278.54 --> 6282.71
avoids the coast and back because so if

6281.36 --> 6284.36
you're stood on the land a life

6282.71 --> 6286.04
supposing this is you stood on the land

6284.36 --> 6287.9
there so there's you stood more and

6286.04 --> 6289.64
you're trying to view a boat over here

6287.9 --> 6291.74
let's just put you the boat here so

6289.64 --> 6293.87
there's there's you were the boat right

6291.74 --> 6296.719999999999
and then you've got this pressure rise

6293.87 --> 6298.94
the pressure bulge as the tide moves in

6296.72 --> 6301.490000000001
that is creating this hump in this at

6298.94 --> 6302.719999999999
this exact location right you're not

6301.49 --> 6304.099999999999
going to have a direct line of sight to

6302.72 --> 6307.1
it because you're just going to

6304.1 --> 6309.29
encounter the Bulge yeah that's what

6307.1 --> 6311.450000000001
happens that's how the topography of the

6309.29 --> 6314.6
land you know you need to understand

6311.45 --> 6317.54
this you know that this displacement of

6314.6 --> 6318.17
water is it pushing in from the right to

6317.54 --> 6321.29
the left

6318.17 --> 6324.77
is it it's being funneled into a

6321.29 --> 6326.87
bottleneck a very very shallow region

6324.77 --> 6329.0
here just here but you've got the whole

6326.87 --> 6331.79
ocean pushing in and it goes even

6329.0 --> 6335.45
further it goes down to 3,000 meters in

6331.79 --> 6337.91
depth 3.0 it does take quite a distance

6335.45 --> 6340.25
now before it does it's not that steep

6337.91 --> 6343.25
right but it's miles 20 miles you go out

6340.25 --> 6345.8
20 miles past the a mile and it goes

6343.25 --> 6348.56
down to 3,000 meters in depth really

6345.8 --> 6350.570000000001
yes it goes holy [ __ ] it's that steep

6348.56 --> 6352.34
yeah it's literal I mean what you're

6350.57 --> 6353.15
seeing now it literally continues on

6352.34 --> 6354.88
like that

6353.15 --> 6357.53
the entire way so you have anymore

6354.88 --> 6362.12
enormous amount of water being pushed

6357.53 --> 6364.909
into a very very low-lying area here and

6362.12 --> 6367.159
where where it meets this this point

6364.909 --> 6369.379999999999
here where it meets this point this is

6367.159 --> 6371.839999999999
where you're gonna get this it has to

6369.38 --> 6373.159000000001
and it's called a barotropic well I

6371.84 --> 6376.64
don't know if it's actually caught I

6373.159 --> 6378.53
need to get clarification I know there's

6376.64 --> 6380.87
barotropic layers and stuff like this so

6378.53 --> 6383.54
my description may be completely wrong

6380.87 --> 6385.79
for the actual saying of barotropic tags

6383.54 --> 6388.4
but I know that the Barrett robic tags

6385.79 --> 6390.94
happen in this location it's also to do

6388.4 --> 6393.259999999999
with the mixing of the different

6390.94 --> 6394.849999999999
temperatures of water so the deep down

6393.26 --> 6397.1
you go you've got cold water then you've

6394.85 --> 6400.909000000001
got warm water the waters part at the

6397.1 --> 6404.0
top and yeah but she didn't mix they

6400.909 --> 6405.44
don't mix your wet needed them well when

6404.0 --> 6408.11
it's being pushed in in this location

6405.44 --> 6410.15
here what happens is they do have to mix

6408.11 --> 6413.089999999999
they have to mix because the cold has

6410.15 --> 6415.339999999999
been forceful this hill is being forced

6413.09 --> 6418.88
up and it's being forced to mingle with

6415.34 --> 6421.159000000001
the warm waters of Bob Marley once it's

6418.88 --> 6423.409000000001
on top of there yeah of course yeah and

6421.159 --> 6425.389999999999
again when it reaches the top you've got

6423.409 --> 6426.949
all this mixing of water the coal the

6425.39 --> 6429.79
water and stuff and it causes all this

6426.949 --> 6432.589999999999
kind of disturbance at the top so

6429.79 --> 6435.7699999999995
there's a lot going on in areas where

6432.59 --> 6438.05
you've got this this steep Ridge you

6435.77 --> 6440.06
know and the tide pushing it but it also

6438.05 --> 6443.09
works on the tide coming out as well for

6440.06 --> 6445.909000000001
me then also really explains well

6443.09 --> 6448.1
actually how things get washed up on

6445.909 --> 6450.11
shore because even though it might be

6448.1 --> 6452.4490000000005
sinking to the bottom if it's gonna be

6450.11 --> 6454.3099999999995
pushed eventually it might end up

6452.449 --> 6458.239
through that bottom layer just being

6454.31 --> 6459.7390000000005
pushed up on land hmm well you know I

6458.239 --> 6461.449
mean this is things that you know as

6459.739 --> 6463.459999999999
flat earthers we need to look into this

6461.449 --> 6465.919999999999
the evidence is out there the research

6463.46 --> 6468.469
is out there but the talk and such terms

6465.92 --> 6469.85
that you know I don't understand half of

6468.469 --> 6472.07
it you know I'm trying to learn

6469.85 --> 6474.409000000001
basically I'm trying to learn I'm

6472.07 --> 6476.33
reading through papers that people are

6474.409 --> 6478.46
putting out about barotropic tags and

6476.33 --> 6481.159
stuff like this and the terminology that

6478.46 --> 6482.75
they use in I don't understand it I

6481.159 --> 6484.429
literally just don't understand it

6482.75 --> 6486.56
there's only specialist don't understand

6484.429 --> 6487.21
yeah it's very specialized courses well

6486.56 --> 6488.5
you're supposed to

6487.21 --> 6492.1
complicates that you don't really

6488.5 --> 6494.32
understand it yeah maybe maybe maybe or

6492.1 --> 6497.71
maybe turns out to be all very relative

6494.32 --> 6500.17
details okay you know if they spoke in

6497.71 --> 6503.35
human terms and I say that in them in

6500.17 --> 6505.51
the nicest way you know human terms okay

6503.35 --> 6507.88
in this area you are way to get the

6505.51 --> 6509.8
Bulge you know but nobody going to agree

6507.88 --> 6513.67
to talk about okay you know the way they

6509.8 --> 6515.77
describe it is so you know what can the

6513.67 --> 6518.02
display will be so simple that they just

6515.77 --> 6520.96
have to make it a lot more how to

6518.02 --> 6522.610000000001
complicate things you know so

6520.96 --> 6525.28
frustrating because to try and get a

6522.61 --> 6527.469
citation you know you ended not quote in

6525.28 --> 6529.21
a paragraph or something and the

6527.469 --> 6531.82
audience would get lost in three

6529.21 --> 6533.95
quarters of the terminology you know you

6531.82 --> 6535.36
know and you know and even half of it

6533.95 --> 6536.95
I'm not even understanding I'm just

6535.36 --> 6540.639999999999
picking out details that I can

6536.95 --> 6542.95
understand and make you know sense and

6540.64 --> 6545.7390000000005
this is what the learning should make

6542.95 --> 6547.78
sense to me yeah perfect well I'm

6545.739 --> 6551.11
looking at this doll just a drawing

6547.78 --> 6553.2699999999995
alone made sense to me I pretty much

6551.11 --> 6555.46
figured it out as I know I proved it I

6553.27 --> 6558.570000000001
pretty much soulless said what was gonna

6555.46 --> 6560.89
be happening you you confirmed that so

6558.57 --> 6562.69
yes so you trying to see this boat here

6560.89 --> 6564.9400000000005
you know you've got a direct line of

6562.69 --> 6566.71
sight to it normally well obviously the

6564.94 --> 6570.5199999999995
tide movement pushing in course it

6566.71 --> 6571.9
causing this localized bulge and that's

6570.52 --> 6573.55
what I'm going to call it a localized

6571.9 --> 6576.25
balls because it would just happen this

6573.55 --> 6578.35
you know this sort of area you know that

6576.25 --> 6581.1
sort of area this has been a localized

6578.35 --> 6583.360000000001
bulge and you know obviously

6581.1 --> 6585.4890000000005
exponentially you know so I'm gonna draw

6583.36 --> 6587.65
a line exponentially higher and higher

6585.489 --> 6590.468999999999
and higher so eventually it will hide

6587.65 --> 6592.299999999999
you know hills mountains eventually

6590.469 --> 6596.05
entire continents you know yeah it's

6592.3 --> 6598.27
localized bulge it only has to be a few

6596.05 --> 6598.54
inches it could go to a few feet right

6598.27 --> 6601.06
now

6598.54 --> 6603.04
a couple of meters whatever it is just

6601.06 --> 6606.160000000001
depend ultimately windmills remember

6603.04 --> 6608.5
that one all kinds of stuff oh so that

6606.16 --> 6610.36
is actually obstruction so there is

6608.5 --> 6612.37
consumed and due to limited viewing

6610.36 --> 6614.86
angle and everything but there is also

6612.37 --> 6617.37
actual obstruction in coastal regions

6614.86 --> 6619.45
that's that's kind of relevant to know

6617.37 --> 6620.349
so I just thought I'd bring that to your

6619.45 --> 6622.239
attention

6620.349 --> 6625.09
it's interesting to look into because

6622.239 --> 6628.388999999999
again why Prem this up before you know

6625.09 --> 6631.329
when she miss quotes and she says oh so

6628.389 --> 6634.96
now we have bulging water you know it's

6631.329 --> 6636.5199999999995
kind of like it's taken out of context

6634.96 --> 6637.929
while I'm actually saying you know I'm

6636.52 --> 6640.51
not saying this curvature of the earth

6637.929 --> 6642.55
I'm saying there is bulging in local it

6640.51 --> 6644.26
you know in locations like this way

6642.55 --> 6647.59
enough this topography well there's just

6644.26 --> 6651.46
a literal obstruction apparently due to

6647.59 --> 6653.409000000001
the natural layout of things well they

6651.46 --> 6657.04
just have structure now after water it's

6653.409 --> 6659.679
really good to know so whenever anybody

6657.04 --> 6662.5
shows a boat again that's clearly hidden

6659.679 --> 6665.2300000000005
you know in some respect by visible

6662.5 --> 6666.969
water all you need to do is go to the to

6665.23 --> 6668.888999999999
Google Earth and just check the deaths

6666.969 --> 6671.38
you know just check the deaths in the

6668.889 --> 6673.4400000000005
area and you'll see that you know

6671.38 --> 6676.2390000000005
they'll be a probably a very steep

6673.44 --> 6678.428999999999
runoff at some point something like this

6676.239 --> 6680.11
but it will be causing this and check

6678.429 --> 6682.3
that the movement of the tide is the

6680.11 --> 6683.889
time moving in is it going out you know

6682.3 --> 6686.17
all this kind of thing you can determine

6683.889 --> 6687.55
that from the wave movements on the top

6686.17 --> 6691.17
and you know some people will disagree

6687.55 --> 6692.4400000000005
because they'll say that this windblown

6691.17 --> 6695.11
waves

6692.44 --> 6697.48
I disagree you can generally tell us

6695.11 --> 6698.889
that what wave of the tides moving you

6697.48 --> 6701.348999999999
know having spent a year down at the

6698.889 --> 6703.4800000000005
beach and much more I can certainly say

6701.349 --> 6705.7300000000005
I can tell when the tides moving and

6703.48 --> 6708.28
going out simply by looking at the waves

6705.73 --> 6710.468999999999
so I'm seeing wave go from right to left

6708.28 --> 6712.57
I ain't know that the tags probably

6710.469 --> 6716.05
coming in or whatever you know depending

6712.57 --> 6718.449
on which region I'm looking at so it's a

6716.05 --> 6720.04
it's a stupid argument that just seeing

6718.449 --> 6721.509999999999
because you see in the waves go from

6720.04 --> 6723.28
right to left that means that they're

6721.51 --> 6725.29
being blown from right to left and the

6723.28 --> 6727.989
tag on these is going from left to right

6725.29 --> 6729.5199999999995
what's a horseman you know you can work

6727.989 --> 6732.3099999999995
it out for yourself if you've got a half

6729.52 --> 6734.5
a brain cell but but yeah this is

6732.31 --> 6736.42
another thing that perhaps all the

6734.5 --> 6738.579
people wanna look into you know the work

6736.42 --> 6740.139
we did last year laugh this short hopped

6738.579 --> 6743.139
on so that he does an excellent

6740.139 --> 6744.07
presentation you know about this exact

6743.139 --> 6745.96
thing that I've been trying to talk

6744.07 --> 6748.0
about all year this is another thing

6745.96 --> 6751.51
that you know maybe some kind of student

6748.0 --> 6752.469
this looking into you know the way the

6751.51 --> 6756.43
oceans move

6752.469 --> 6758.26
and a geologist of some sort you know

6756.43 --> 6761.08
might be able to want to take up that

6758.26 --> 6762.91
mantle and look into this for me because

6761.08 --> 6764.949
you know I've approached this in

6762.91 --> 6767.08
approached this now let other people

6764.949 --> 6769.57
talk about it because to be fair I don't

6767.08 --> 6770.92
understand the funky terminology you

6769.57 --> 6772.96
could discuss you could definitely

6770.92 --> 6775.2300000000005
discuss it with the geologist but if

6772.96 --> 6779.08
you're gonna involve Flat Earth in it

6775.23 --> 6780.82
they might be kind of like well I don't

6779.08 --> 6782.62
know I mean you've got today is that a

6780.82 --> 6785.41
turning around and basically now agree

6782.62 --> 6789.599999999999
you know hey you know woody but it's

6785.41 --> 6793.96
surveyor is not necessarily a very deep

6789.6 --> 6797.1990000000005
way job although element to me but being

6793.96 --> 6799.75
a geologist yeah that is a very big

6797.199 --> 6800.83
study area so they might be very

6799.75 --> 6803.23
squeamish

6800.83 --> 6805.11
if you mentioned flat earth or they say

6803.23 --> 6811.299999999999
yeah please just don't bring it up I

6805.11 --> 6813.58
don't know but people of course of

6811.3 --> 6816.67
course look that could happen there

6813.58 --> 6818.89
could be a transition where just free

6816.67 --> 6821.38
science thinkers are starting to figure

6818.89 --> 6823.9890000000005
out like yeah this thing is a mess and

6821.38 --> 6826.87
it needs to change and they might go

6823.989 --> 6828.669999999999
with Flat Earth or check it out or be

6826.87 --> 6832.15
just not as squeamish about it

6828.67 --> 6833.86
eventually anymore we'll see but yeah

6832.15 --> 6836.799999999999
the great great material great

6833.86 --> 6840.339999999999
presentation Thank You Randy sir very

6836.8 --> 6845.320000000001
thought-provoking I will be keeping that

6840.34 --> 6847.719
in mind and have you guys ever actually

6845.32 --> 6851.199
heard us from a or saying that he's you

6847.719 --> 6855.88
know measured the earth curve no only

6851.199 --> 6857.83
rumpus and ballers I don't think an

6855.88 --> 6860.86
actual surfer here I've heard plenty of

6857.83 --> 6864.04
them say they've measured her flat I've

6860.86 --> 6866.65
never heard anyone of them at least as

6864.04 --> 6869.08
far as I know yeah it could be wrong if

6866.65 --> 6871.54
I am was somebody hit me with a link

6869.08 --> 6874.09
port it surveyors saying he's measured

6871.54 --> 6876.73
the earth curvature so because that

6874.09 --> 6879.51
would be interesting I don't know I

6876.73 --> 6883.928999999999
don't remember ever hearing a surveyor

6879.51 --> 6885.3
mentioning that yeah that that it's

6883.929 --> 6887.91
curvature and

6885.3 --> 6890.67
even interested in that and really maybe

6887.91 --> 6892.41
one guy is a real science-fiction fan

6890.67 --> 6893.9400000000005
and he also happens to be a survey or

6892.41 --> 6896.43
maybe somebody like that is out there

6893.94 --> 6899.49
but I think just surveyors in general

6896.43 --> 6902.700000000001
arts like part of a practical team

6899.49 --> 6904.8
builders construction workers all that

6902.7 --> 6908.5199999999995
and they don't really specifically care

6904.8 --> 6911.43
about sphere or flat I think maybe I'm

6908.52 --> 6914.610000000001
wrong I look who's talking the guy that

6911.43 --> 6917.58
it's not really involved in society that

6914.61 --> 6920.58
much when it comes to job so I'm the one

6917.58 --> 6923.15
not really the one to talk but from what

6920.58 --> 6925.89
I figure out that the job should entail

6923.15 --> 6928.08
there's not really a lot of science

6925.89 --> 6930.360000000001
involved it's pretty much just a good

6928.08 --> 6933.3
trick that can be used for measuring and

6930.36 --> 6937.41
confirming details involving building

6933.3 --> 6941.52
things and maintenance so I don't see

6937.41 --> 6947.73
any special cultural necessity for them

6941.52 --> 6948.990000000001
to be a glower per se anyway guys I

6947.73 --> 6951.2699999999995
think I'm gonna run out the show we've

6948.99 --> 6956.76
been going for at least two and a half

6951.27 --> 6959.370000000001
hour and I'm getting kind of hungry so

6956.76 --> 6961.05
thank you both for coming was awesome

6959.37 --> 6963.57
thank you for being on the panel and

6961.05 --> 6965.96
yeah again Randy thank you so much for

6963.57 --> 6968.34
this really good and informative a

6965.96 --> 6970.83
relatively short presentation it's

6968.34 --> 6974.400000000001
really good straight to the point good

6970.83 --> 6976.92
visuals very clear up very good thank

6974.4 --> 6979.58
you for doing it on my channel much

6976.92 --> 6979.58
appreciated

6979.85 --> 6992.900000000001
you're still there Randy I'm here he's

6985.47 --> 6996.81
muted maybe he's already gone for lunch

6992.9 --> 7000.5599999999995
anyway yeah hey thanks for being on the

6996.81 --> 7004.13
panel to Chaco and Theo makeover t he

7000.56 --> 7008.72
left halfway but thanks to him for

7004.13 --> 7011.51
coming on the panel as well and yeah see

7008.72 --> 7013.31
you guys see you guys around in chats

7011.51 --> 7017.030000000001
and at least on the flat earth debates

7013.31 --> 7019.01
tomorrow so thanks for coming everyone

7017.03 --> 7023.53
Easter everybody and the

7019.01 --> 7026.530000000001
everybody hope to have a good day later

7023.53 --> 7026.53
alright

7026.98 --> 7035.36
so yeah it was pretty long what

7030.56 --> 7037.490000000001
interesting show loved the presentation

7035.36 --> 7039.41
that was really good to know I was

7037.49 --> 7041.3
already informed about the concept of

7039.41 --> 7043.37
the vault but this like really cleared

7041.3 --> 7045.9800000000005
it up how that technically works so I

7043.37 --> 7047.57
personally appreciate that a lot Randi

7045.98 --> 7051.169999999999
thank you for presenting that on my show

7047.57 --> 7053.59
very informative good to think about and

7051.17 --> 7058.61
keep in the back of mind every time

7053.59 --> 7062.42
curvature versus flat is discussed so

7058.61 --> 7066.139999999999
thanks everyone for coming if you like

7062.42 --> 7068.03
the video please upload it vote yep

7066.14 --> 7070.7300000000005
or download it if you're a troll I don't

7068.03 --> 7072.29
really mind and if you haven't already

Amsterdam time yeah you can support my

7082.19 --> 7086.99
efforts and the show and the expansion

7084.68 --> 7091.13
of the show and hopefully more equipment

7086.99 --> 7094.49
and also helping me out survive if not

7091.13 --> 7097.61
being all that rich donate to the super

7094.49 --> 7100.3099999999995
chat PayPal and patreon come part of

7097.61 --> 7105.799999999999
that eventually I'm also gonna try to

7100.31 --> 7108.14
expand out on other plat but oh I think

7105.8 --> 7109.58
I clicked away the wrong thing so now

7108.14 --> 7117.68
you're seeing somebody's face here

7109.58 --> 7120.719
that's weird anyway my bad oh wait I

7117.68 --> 7127.1
think I can restore that

7120.719 --> 7135.42
right no no no that's weird

7127.1 --> 7146.55
let's see sorry for messing this up all

7135.42 --> 7150.08
right yep its back good so I got one

7146.55 --> 7153.150000000001
subscriber me so thanks for subscribing

7158.91 --> 7163.7699999999995
then add me on skype we can also talk

7161.01 --> 7165.75
discuss things you can invite me on your

7163.77 --> 7167.6990000000005
show if you want to I am by the way

7165.75 --> 7173.28
don't forget gonna be present on

7167.699 --> 7176.3099999999995
Murrells show tonight so I'll see some

7173.28 --> 7179.389999999999
of you there on his channel as well I'll

7176.31 --> 7179.39
link it up again

7180.41 --> 7189.03
[Music]

Merle Beauregard so here's his channel

7189.03 --> 7196.44
and I will be back tomorrow with Flat

7193.44 --> 7202.71
Earth debates definitely it's gonna be

7196.44 --> 7209.099999999999
there as normal and no I don't think so

7202.71 --> 7213.17
yeah until the next show keep it flat
