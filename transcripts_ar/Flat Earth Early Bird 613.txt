76.479 --> 82.96
so whether

79.759 --> 85.84
whether today is yeah it's kind of

82.96 --> 90.32
similar to yesterday it's less

85.84 --> 90.32000000000001
moist still very windy

90.56 --> 93.92
warm when the sun is out kind of fresh

93.119 --> 97.2
when the

93.92 --> 98.72
sun is behind one of these clouds and

97.2 --> 100.24000000000001
they're a little bit more scattered over

98.72 --> 103.92
the place so not so many

100.24 --> 106.88
super thick clouds like yesterday

103.92 --> 107.52
but also a little bit fewer blue spaces

106.88 --> 109.439
in between

107.52 --> 112.24
and again i've noticed this morning that

109.439 --> 115.6
they did chemtrail a lot so

112.24 --> 118.24
there's this haze

115.6 --> 119.52
up there above the clouds it's

118.24 --> 124.24
definitely a

119.52 --> 124.24
higher than that so anyway

126.24 --> 130.64
come on right

131.2 --> 133.44
so

135.44 --> 143.84
i have green tea with me as usual and

139.04 --> 143.84
grapefruit juice again

145.76 --> 149.599
so let's see who is in chat i'm a little

147.52 --> 151.76000000000002
bit early because i already saw

149.599 --> 153.76
so many people leaking in thought i

151.76 --> 158.16
started early because i started a bit

153.76 --> 160.56
late yesterday uh steve was first

158.16 --> 162.0
the miss kang tom parker amanda young

160.56 --> 164.72
good servant

162.0 --> 164.72
obermoco

166.879 --> 174.239
agm with his new laptop apparently

170.319 --> 177.11999999999998
roger robin stanley

174.239 --> 177.12
martin tallberg

177.68 --> 181.84
right yeah and thanks again martin

180.48 --> 185.04
talberg for that

181.84 --> 187.04
paypal donation from two days ago i did

185.04 --> 189.519
shout you out yesterday you probably

187.04 --> 191.84
picked up on that thank you very much

189.519 --> 191.84
for that

195.84 --> 201.76
right yesterday

199.519 --> 203.76
was not as late a day as the day before

201.76 --> 206.319
for me but it was kind of late so i

203.76 --> 213.76
like stayed up until one it's not that

206.319 --> 216.48
late for me

213.76 --> 216.959
and it seems again i forgot to make

216.48 --> 220.23899999999998
notes

216.959 --> 223.44
which is kind of stupid because i did

220.239 --> 227.84
quite a lot i have to remember it

223.44 --> 227.84
piece by piece uh

228.72 --> 233.28
was their own benjamin yesterday i think

230.879 --> 233.28
it was

236.48 --> 242.319
i remember being there uh also much

239.519 --> 242.31900000000002
watched more

246.08 --> 252.84
glitch on netflix

249.599 --> 256.32
into the third season now

252.84 --> 258.479
it's yeah they get the

256.32 --> 259.44
things happen in the second season that

258.479 --> 262.8
kind of

259.44 --> 265.12
took away some of the momentum for me

262.8 --> 269.199
but it's yeah still curious as to where

265.12 --> 272.0
it's gonna go

269.199 --> 273.68
in the third season which i'm just like

272.0 --> 277.199
in episode one now

273.68 --> 277.199
and after that i thought it was enough

280.84 --> 284.71999999999997
uh

282.24 --> 284.72
what else

288.32 --> 292.24
right well the flat earth debates

289.68 --> 295.36
yesterday were very good

292.24 --> 297.84000000000003
it's good being part of that

295.36 --> 297.84000000000003
uh

300.16 --> 304.08000000000004
what else what else what else what was i

308.84 --> 311.84
doing

313.039 --> 315.36
hmm

320.08 --> 324.32
well yeah there were other shows oh yeah

322.16 --> 325.199
yeah i was over at martin lead kiss also

324.32 --> 327.84
for a bit

325.199 --> 327.84000000000003
that was fun

328.639 --> 335.039
although yeah i came in a bit late and i

331.84 --> 335.039
never really got the

335.36 --> 338.639
yeah it was about human light bulbs or

338.0 --> 340.32
something but

338.639 --> 342.0
never really cleared up to me what that

340.32 --> 342.639
was about but i probably should have

342.0 --> 346.0
watched

342.639 --> 350.08
the entire thing for that

346.0 --> 350.639
and i didn't but yeah it was good to be

350.08 --> 352.4
there and

350.639 --> 355.919
martin's always very nice and he always

352.4 --> 355.919
shouts me out when i'm in chat

357.199 --> 361.52000000000004
wasn't there there was also like a a

360.16 --> 364.319
street

361.52 --> 366.31899999999996
live stream as well with a whole bunch

364.319 --> 368.16
of people

366.319 --> 370.0
maybe that was that was monday it could

368.16 --> 372.56
have been monday as well i did

370.0 --> 374.72
mix it up you know just sporadically

372.56 --> 378.08
watch some videos here and there

374.72 --> 382.08000000000004
oh yeah i also remember i watched

378.08 --> 384.4
i just felt like

382.08 --> 385.28
it's a mindless distraction so i watched

384.4 --> 389.59999999999997
uh

385.28 --> 391.75899999999996
just a whole row of davey 504 videos

389.6 --> 393.44
because i think i skipped some so that

391.759 --> 397.84000000000003
was kind of fun

393.44 --> 397.84
uh nothing really special

402.96 --> 406.79999999999995
right yeah agm i get it you just got a

405.44 --> 409.919
new laptop

406.8 --> 413.52000000000004
just fresh from the from the store

409.919 --> 414.56
and it's very fast i get it i advise you

413.52 --> 417.039
to

414.56 --> 418.4
start out cleaning it up because usually

417.039 --> 420.96
pre-installed

418.4 --> 424.79999999999995
laptops have a lot of junk on them that

420.96 --> 424.79999999999995
overtime will make it more slow

431.03 --> 437.84
[Music]

433.52 --> 437.84
all right

448.84 --> 451.84
hmm

455.52 --> 459.919
all right yeah i used details details

458.16 --> 464.47900000000004
not really important i didn't

459.919 --> 466.639
get any wine yesterday thought after the

464.479 --> 468.96
that experience with the wine on sunday

466.639 --> 471.84000000000003
i uh i don't know

468.96 --> 473.039
i thought i uh i do without just take

471.84 --> 476.23999999999995
the beers

473.039 --> 479.36
but i did and i don't know

476.24 --> 481.599
it's weird it is different it's it's

479.36 --> 484.47900000000004
very different as when i

481.599 --> 485.759
drink wine afterwards even if not a lot

484.479 --> 490.31899999999996
compared to none at all

485.759 --> 492.08000000000004
i don't know why but uh

490.319 --> 495.28000000000003
yeah i did get a new bottle of wine i

492.08 --> 499.52
don't know if i'm i'm gonna try to just

495.28 --> 499.52
maybe take one glass somewhere afterward

499.84 --> 507.039
but yeah maybe i've just kind of

503.36 --> 510.16
run with alcohol a little bit

507.039 --> 512.399
too long and it's kind of like the if

510.16 --> 514.159
yeah the positive effects if you can

512.399 --> 515.76
call it that the

514.159 --> 518.0
things that i like it for maybe are

515.76 --> 518.8
wearing slightly off slowly so maybe i

518.0 --> 523.279
just

518.8 --> 523.279
slow it down ah

525.76 --> 531.04
not be around to call it my vacation is

528.16 --> 531.04
about to end ah

531.6 --> 537.0400000000001
all right martin tolbert

535.2 --> 539.9200000000001
so you've been kind of spending your

537.04 --> 539.92
vacation here

540.32 --> 549.839
okay it's an honor i hope

543.36 --> 549.839
you've picked up on a lot of things

552.8 --> 556.56
right also yeah i don't know how this

555.6 --> 558.08
happened

556.56 --> 561.04
yeah i did know how it happened i

558.08 --> 563.6800000000001
watched back yesterday's early bird show

561.04 --> 565.36
and it like i even said in it like oh i

563.68 --> 567.1999999999999
got a title but then

565.36 --> 569.279
yeah i pretty much the rest of the

567.2 --> 571.519
episode were other subjects and then i

569.279 --> 574.72
got a bit confused like

571.519 --> 574.72
i wasn't sure yet

574.88 --> 578.56
what i should call it it's kind of the

576.399 --> 579.36
problem when my show has multiple

578.56 --> 582.399
subjects

579.36 --> 583.92
that don't really connect it's kind of

582.399 --> 591.839
difficult to then just stick to a

583.92 --> 591.8389999999999
singular name

592.8 --> 609.3599999999999
amen that's you all right

605.36 --> 611.6
install linux on it iron fe

609.36 --> 613.279
well he could do that if he knows how to

611.6 --> 618.48
deal with linux

613.279 --> 620.48
it's very different

618.48 --> 621.9200000000001
i've considered that many times but to

620.48 --> 626.16
me it's just that

621.92 --> 627.1999999999999
standard pc with windows yeah i'm so

626.16 --> 630.24
used to that

627.2 --> 630.24
that i

630.959 --> 636.0
you been always been very hesitant to

632.8 --> 636.0
make such a transition

640.8 --> 643.92
like i i'd have to have multiple

643.12 --> 648.32
computers

643.92 --> 651.04
available to me and then yeah i would

648.32 --> 652.1600000000001
probably try a linux installation in one

651.04 --> 654.64
of them

652.16 --> 656.0
so that if it just doesn't work out i'll

654.64 --> 659.12
still have a

656.0 --> 660.48
complete windows running pc for

659.12 --> 663.839
everything i do

660.48 --> 663.839
so yeah that's my reason

669.68 --> 675.8389999999999
why the literalist is a code or two

673.04 --> 675.8389999999999
okay

682.72 --> 689.839
all right so programmer cool

700.839 --> 703.839
uh

707.92 --> 717.8389999999999
all right

717.92 --> 731.8389999999999
what happened

732.74 --> 738.72
[Music]

734.399 --> 741.2
political yesterday egypt war testified

738.72 --> 743.44
right yeah there seems to be a lot going

741.2 --> 743.44
on

743.68 --> 746.7199999999999
in the news like that

754.0 --> 758.16
like every time that subject comes up it

756.32 --> 760.9590000000001
almost like tires me out i

758.16 --> 761.519
lose my breath you know there's other

760.959 --> 764.079
people

761.519 --> 765.2
even flat earthers that just continually

764.079 --> 768.8
talk about all this

765.2 --> 772.24
just the masks and doctors and the

768.8 --> 774.7199999999999
situations and all that

772.24 --> 775.839
and i don't get how they just can't keep

774.72 --> 778.8000000000001
on doing it it just

775.839 --> 778.8000000000001
tires me out

779.2 --> 785.279
it's like literally

782.8 --> 786.0
like give really a physical response it

785.279 --> 788.16
tires me

786.0 --> 788.16
out

798.88 --> 803.36
but maybe it's just because i'm kind of

800.88 --> 806.56
saturated with it all

803.36 --> 808.8000000000001
look i'm just sick of it i just want it

806.56 --> 815.8389999999999
to go away

808.8 --> 815.8389999999999
it's probably not going to

816.56 --> 829.8389999999999
but yeah i'm not gonna wear anything

821.68 --> 829.8389999999999
on my face at least

832.72 --> 836.8000000000001
it wears me off no you mean tires you

836.16 --> 840.079
out

836.8 --> 840.079
do you wear it off

841.04 --> 845.279
that that's not correct english i think

850.079 --> 857.8389999999999
yeah good to hear robin stanley

860.48 --> 865.9200000000001
oh god i was a topic really why

869.04 --> 876.0
now martin tolbert that tire

872.639 --> 880.8
tiring you off is not english

876.0 --> 883.519
let's tire you out or it turns you off

880.8 --> 886.16
yeah you're you're mixing meanings it's

883.519 --> 886.16
not correct

893.04 --> 900.24
anyway sorry to be picky about that

896.72 --> 900.24
but yeah agm any hint

904.48 --> 912.8000000000001
oh you don't want why did you bring it

906.56 --> 915.4399999999999
up then

912.8 --> 916.639
so hey you could go tell everyone

915.44 --> 918.8000000000001
whatever you know

916.639 --> 920.5600000000001
what was it about how i'm on social

918.8 --> 923.5999999999999
welfare and

920.56 --> 926.399
or how i have anger issues or

923.6 --> 927.6
how i'm so incredibly intolerant or what

926.399 --> 932.079
what

927.6 --> 932.0790000000001
how i'm crazy what

939.12 --> 944.639
now i'm not gonna watch randy's show agm

947.199 --> 951.02
just tell me look if if that if

949.759 --> 953.04
something stood out to you

951.02 --> 955.199
[Music]

953.04 --> 956.959
were they were gossiping about me well

955.199 --> 958.959
just say what it is

956.959 --> 961.04
you know the trolls are just gonna spout

958.959 --> 969.68
it anyway the first opportunity

961.04 --> 972.78
so just say it

969.68 --> 972.78
[Music]

973.839 --> 980.8000000000001
enclosed environment housing what

977.199 --> 983.41
this is yeah that's

980.8 --> 984.7199999999999
that is absurd

983.41 --> 990.16
[Music]

984.72 --> 993.44
right does this look like a hospital

990.16 --> 994.079
you know people if they really want to

993.44 --> 996.8000000000001
they can

994.079 --> 997.4399999999999
technically figure out where this is

996.8 --> 1000.4799999999999
i've

997.44 --> 1005.519
i literally gave the address you can go

1000.48 --> 1008.24
go on freaking google maps whatever

1005.519 --> 1008.639
with video and literally see where this

1008.24 --> 1012.0
is

1008.639 --> 1014.399
this is a flat apartment building

1012.0 --> 1016.16
right in front of a church of latter-day

1014.399 --> 1018.72
saints in the north of utrecht

1016.16 --> 1020.959
this is not a hospital so they can

1018.72 --> 1021.759
fantasize about that all day long if

1020.959 --> 1026.0
they like

1021.759 --> 1026.88
but in pretty well identified location

1026.0 --> 1032.319
wise

1026.88 --> 1032.3190000000002
okay so how is that supposed to offend

1036.839 --> 1039.839
me

1040.64 --> 1045.439
this is just ridiculous it's it's

1043.839 --> 1047.4389999999999
the same type of nonsense as what

1045.439 --> 1049.679
ballers do

1047.439 --> 1049.679
so

1051.44 --> 1058.0800000000002
oh from larry harry from

1054.96 --> 1058.559
yeah well that guy is is just a piece of

1058.08 --> 1060.8799999999999
trash

1058.559 --> 1063.6789999999999
anyway so yeah i totally expect that

1060.88 --> 1067.8400000000001
kind of nonsense coming from him

1063.679 --> 1067.8400000000001
and it's lenny harry by the way

1070.559 --> 1074.799
all right thanks again that's fine

1075.039 --> 1080.48
but you should realize that it is just

1077.44 --> 1083.039
ridiculous fantasizing

1080.48 --> 1084.16
like the things that i mentioned yeah i

1083.039 --> 1087.28
could imagine

1084.16 --> 1088.799
that since they are technically true

1087.28 --> 1090.72
up to a certain degree and i've

1088.799 --> 1093.039
justified it

1090.72 --> 1094.24
explained it that yeah one could

1093.039 --> 1097.44
complain about that but

1094.24 --> 1099.36
that's not even that's not even it so

1097.44 --> 1101.039
they're just fantasizing about

1099.36 --> 1102.799
nonsense situations that they're

1101.039 --> 1109.84
presupposing i'm in

1102.799 --> 1109.84
it's just ridiculous

1116.4 --> 1120.64
okay good servant i guess you were there

1120.84 --> 1123.84
too

1130.559 --> 1134.6399999999999
now clary went on blabbering

1134.799 --> 1138.16
well clary is a big blabberer so yeah

1137.679 --> 1140.5590000000002
sure

1138.16 --> 1140.559
why not

1142.72 --> 1151.84
he says all kinds of things

1168.0 --> 1171.6
right anyway

1172.4 --> 1175.76
i didn't even say anything okay fine

1174.72 --> 1178.96
well yeah i

1175.76 --> 1180.799
look it's nonsense gossip in another

1178.96 --> 1183.28
show and i don't really care about it

1180.799 --> 1185.44
it's one of the reasons i i don't even

1183.28 --> 1188.6399999999999
go there anymore

1185.44 --> 1189.6000000000001
you know i'll i'll even pop by jose

1188.64 --> 1192.24
sometime

1189.6 --> 1194.0
maybe to just make a certain comment or

1192.24 --> 1195.52
whatever and then go away again because

1194.0 --> 1197.2
they're going to be spouting my name and

1195.52 --> 1199.039
blabbering nonsense for at least 10

1197.2 --> 1202.96
minutes after that

1199.039 --> 1205.679
so just funny just one say one thing

1202.96 --> 1206.64
half trolls just squirting over it for

1205.679 --> 1208.88
10 minutes

1206.64 --> 1210.72
without me even being there after that i

1208.88 --> 1213.919
i think that's amusing

1210.72 --> 1218.159
but with randy's well he's not even on

1213.919 --> 1218.159
on time slot that's convenient for me

1218.84 --> 1221.84
and

1223.6 --> 1229.6789999999999
yeah i don't know with the crowd that he

1226.48 --> 1229.679
entertains typically

1230.32 --> 1233.52
there's just not a lot of interesting

1232.0 --> 1235.84
things there

1233.52 --> 1235.84
for me

1250.48 --> 1254.559
excite human imagination into all

1252.559 --> 1257.9189999999999
directions deploy random change

1254.559 --> 1258.799
rinse and repeat that is my take on this

1257.919 --> 1261.6000000000001
eye up which

1258.799 --> 1261.6
psyop is that

1264.799 --> 1270.24
pizzagate protests great reset and

1267.2 --> 1273.28
overwhelm depressed minds do not react

1270.24 --> 1275.28
to changes rationally like mandating

1273.28 --> 1278.8799999999999
masks

1275.28 --> 1281.52
yeah right there's a good point to that

1278.88 --> 1286.64
martin tolbert it's basically

1281.52 --> 1289.679
strong-arming depression

1286.64 --> 1294.24
like overwhelming people with

1289.679 --> 1296.96
just very negative [ __ ] that's scary

1294.24 --> 1298.0
and then they will go into a depression

1296.96 --> 1301.28
response state

1298.0 --> 1303.76
and yeah they'll

1301.28 --> 1304.6399999999999
either start rejecting everything or

1303.76 --> 1308.48
just

1304.64 --> 1311.2800000000002
trying to embrace everything either way

1308.48 --> 1311.28
that's typical

1313.28 --> 1320.08
because of a perceived hostility or

1316.559 --> 1322.6399999999999
a perceived need for protection against

1320.08 --> 1325.84
the virtual hostility

1322.64 --> 1327.919
and whether that those aimed choices of

1325.84 --> 1328.559
the the spirit and the mind are correct

1327.919 --> 1330.96
that's

1328.559 --> 1334.8799999999999
that's a different matter but those will

1330.96 --> 1334.88
typically be the responses to that

1336.0 --> 1347.76
[Music]

1344.64 --> 1348.48
okay mandy young you're back did you

1347.76 --> 1350.799
miss well

1348.48 --> 1352.08
agm shared with us that apparently over

1350.799 --> 1354.559
at randy's they were

1352.08 --> 1356.96
blabbering all kinds of stupid rumors

1354.559 --> 1360.24
about me

1356.96 --> 1375.8400000000001
which are completely ridiculous that's

1360.24 --> 1375.84
it that's about it

1380.96 --> 1384.72
right but martin thomark you make a very

1382.88 --> 1390.0800000000002
good point because

1384.72 --> 1393.2
yeah their system their designed

1390.08 --> 1397.84
plan it does not really

1393.2 --> 1399.8400000000001
require uh

1397.84 --> 1402.24
like it doesn't have to be made on the

1399.84 --> 1406.0
spot it's already there so

1402.24 --> 1406.799
the plan actually thrives on everybody

1406.0 --> 1409.84
being just

1406.799 --> 1412.0
overwhelmed and depressed because the

1409.84 --> 1413.4399999999998
plan is always there for the people that

1412.0 --> 1415.36
utilize it to continue

1413.44 --> 1417.52
doesn't care how they feel just if they

1415.36 --> 1420.0
do it or not

1417.52 --> 1422.4
and that way it can always kind of

1420.0 --> 1427.84
continue as long as enough people just

1422.4 --> 1432.88
use it and that's what it is

1427.84 --> 1437.12
it's like this volunteerism based

1432.88 --> 1437.1200000000001
worldwide doomsday device

1438.159 --> 1441.8400000000001
a virtual doomsday device that's just

1440.72 --> 1445.44
like a

1441.84 --> 1448.24
giant apocalyptic or world destroying

1445.44 --> 1448.88
humanity destroying project that is all

1448.24 --> 1453.1200000000001
based on

1448.88 --> 1456.64
voluntary interactions with it

1453.12 --> 1460.0
with potential virtual rewards

1456.64 --> 1462.159
or threats or anything basically

1460.0 --> 1465.12
it'll manipulate in many ways that

1462.159 --> 1468.24
basically trick people to start

1465.12 --> 1468.2399999999998
becoming part of it

1480.88 --> 1484.0
yeah it's kind of funny that you bring

1482.64 --> 1487.3600000000001
that up because

1484.0 --> 1488.799
like besides my activities on youtube

1487.36 --> 1491.039
and whenever i'm watching

1488.799 --> 1492.72
i do have a lot of like introspective

1491.039 --> 1496.08
time where i do reflect back

1492.72 --> 1500.0
on my life in the far past

1496.08 --> 1503.36
late teens and all that and just

1500.0 --> 1505.44
almost yeah it's a weird thing but i'm

1503.36 --> 1506.32
almost trying to communicate with myself

1505.44 --> 1509.76
from them

1506.32 --> 1513.36
trying to reconnect through time

1509.76 --> 1514.1589999999999
and just see like i know so much more

1513.36 --> 1517.84
what what

1514.159 --> 1520.64
would have probably been a good choice

1517.84 --> 1521.279
and i'm figuring out how i was dissuaded

1520.64 --> 1524.0
from that

1521.279 --> 1526.08
why what was the core mistake of that

1524.0 --> 1527.84
well and it's probably derived from my

1526.08 --> 1531.039
own personal

1527.84 --> 1533.4399999999998
ideas that weren't discouraged

1531.039 --> 1534.1589999999999
when i was really really young because

1533.44 --> 1537.2
of

1534.159 --> 1538.7990000000002
the liberalness of the family as it were

1537.2 --> 1541.039
although i think they kind of tried but

1538.799 --> 1544.8799999999999
when i was

1541.039 --> 1548.24
rejecting that they really then just

1544.88 --> 1548.24
let it go to the other side

1548.32 --> 1552.559
kind of like me let me make make my own

1550.559 --> 1555.44
mistakes i

1552.559 --> 1555.84
it's so so weird now to realize that

1555.44 --> 1558.0
that

1555.84 --> 1559.6789999999999
yes i did know that was the policy let

1558.0 --> 1561.44
me make my own mistakes and i was like

1559.679 --> 1562.48
yeah yeah let me make my own mistakes

1561.44 --> 1565.2
and i'm like

1562.48 --> 1568.799
oh my god why did you freaking let me

1565.2 --> 1568.799
make my own mistakes like that

1568.96 --> 1573.8400000000001
like that like there should have been

1572.159 --> 1577.1200000000001
certain things that i

1573.84 --> 1579.36
that i just i should have been dissuaded

1577.12 --> 1581.84
i should have been

1579.36 --> 1582.84
pushed through somehow and i'm figuring

1581.84 --> 1587.6
out like

1582.84 --> 1587.6
why why didn't it happen

1591.12 --> 1596.08
like why didn't i just become a farmer

1593.6 --> 1596.08
or something

1596.32 --> 1603.2
but yeah then i'm kind of wondering back

1600.88 --> 1606.4
in my mind like what was it like for

1603.2 --> 1609.76
example 20 years ago

1606.4 --> 1613.279
and in ways i did kind of

1609.76 --> 1614.559
much more than i do now or at all at

1613.279 --> 1618.4
least

1614.559 --> 1620.96
like go out just meet random people

1618.4 --> 1622.88
as like especially if they were

1620.96 --> 1624.72
different from what i was used to and

1622.88 --> 1626.88
just try to see what they were doing how

1624.72 --> 1628.72
they thought how they felt

1626.88 --> 1630.5590000000002
like testing almost doing my own

1628.72 --> 1632.799
statistical research

1630.559 --> 1633.76
i kind of made it into that it's almost

1632.799 --> 1636.0
like i have

1633.76 --> 1637.919
had like a paper with several questions

1636.0 --> 1639.12
i didn't but it was in my mind and i

1637.919 --> 1641.919
kept asking

1639.12 --> 1643.12
several or well hundreds of people maybe

1641.919 --> 1645.279
even in retrospect

1643.12 --> 1646.4799999999998
these questions like what do you like

1645.279 --> 1647.12
what do you think how do what do you

1646.48 --> 1648.08
want

1647.12 --> 1650.799
what do you think about this what do you

1648.08 --> 1654.1589999999999
think about that and including

1650.799 --> 1654.799
societal things and banks and certain

1654.159 --> 1659.8400000000001
groups

1654.799 --> 1662.399
and yeah and it just seemed that

1659.84 --> 1664.72
all the people wherever they went in

1662.399 --> 1667.039
every direction back then

1664.72 --> 1668.159
they were all falling into these

1667.039 --> 1672.96
specific traps

1668.159 --> 1676.24
into the bank traps into societal traps

1672.96 --> 1678.32
into basically neglecting their

1676.24 --> 1681.6
religions if they had any

1678.32 --> 1684.399
to make that adapt there was a thing to

1681.6 --> 1686.1589999999999
modern society to make it more real that

1684.399 --> 1689.6789999999999
is what was suggested

1686.159 --> 1692.72
so [ __ ] up and

1689.679 --> 1694.0800000000002
the idea that i have now in how i wanted

1692.72 --> 1696.88
to progress

1694.08 --> 1698.559
that was simply not possible it wasn't

1696.88 --> 1701.679
there

1698.559 --> 1705.039
it's so freaky to to realize that that

1701.679 --> 1708.24
i was really just ready like please i

1705.039 --> 1711.279
want to crush i want to like

1708.24 --> 1714.48
really big time

1711.279 --> 1716.88
with a job and like master it and then

1714.48 --> 1718.72
like become just because of my skill

1716.88 --> 1720.7990000000002
become company leader make right

1718.72 --> 1722.799
decisions and

1720.799 --> 1724.399
get on the right side of history all

1722.799 --> 1727.36
that and it just

1724.399 --> 1729.12
it wasn't there and i couldn't really

1727.36 --> 1729.9189999999999
manage to create something out of

1729.12 --> 1732.32
nothing

1729.919 --> 1734.0
just yet i didn't have a good idea i

1732.32 --> 1735.2
thought like a goldsmithing at some

1734.0 --> 1737.6
point

1735.2 --> 1739.44
but then as i did that i just learned

1737.6 --> 1740.8799999999999
yeah that's a craft it's not really

1739.44 --> 1743.919
[Music]

1740.88 --> 1743.919
really good for

1744.72 --> 1749.6000000000001
for bigger business unless you

1747.36 --> 1751.4399999999998
completely industrialize and then

1749.6 --> 1753.84
lose the artistry and love for it

1751.44 --> 1753.8400000000001
basically

1755.919 --> 1760.24
well that was at least then that's the

1758.08 --> 1763.36
way it worked then

1760.24 --> 1765.6
now because i never have

1763.36 --> 1766.7199999999998
done any of that i never really went

1765.6 --> 1770.6399999999999
fully full

1766.72 --> 1773.279
for it full therefore yeah i still have

1770.64 --> 1774.24
love an artistry within goldsmithing and

1773.279 --> 1776.24
it's basically

1774.24 --> 1779.039
it's going to be just a good hobby and

1776.24 --> 1781.84
potential whatever added on to maybe

1779.039 --> 1782.64
i could make some money here and there

1781.84 --> 1786.799
but it's not

1782.64 --> 1789.76
a good vantage point for me it's like

1786.799 --> 1791.9189999999999
i can't just live by that that's not

1789.76 --> 1793.919
gonna work

1791.919 --> 1795.919
and yeah it seems like just me

1793.919 --> 1797.76
blabbering on on youtube

1795.919 --> 1799.679
kind of being a teacher kind of trying

1797.76 --> 1803.12
to impose

1799.679 --> 1804.0
my view of what proper social behavior

1803.12 --> 1806.1589999999999
is

1804.0 --> 1807.36
with issues and addressing those issues

1806.159 --> 1809.8400000000001
and just overall

1807.36 --> 1811.4399999999998
it seems that that is a more viable

1809.84 --> 1815.6
ground for me to just do

1811.44 --> 1815.6000000000001
that every day i'm doing it right now

1816.399 --> 1819.84
it's just that yeah to really make money

1819.279 --> 1822.64
with that

1819.84 --> 1824.399
again it's the stupid the stupid

1822.64 --> 1830.48
contract the stupid deals

1824.399 --> 1832.8799999999999
the yeah sensor yourself for money

1830.48 --> 1835.6
so i'm kind of it's the same package

1832.88 --> 1838.72
only this comes just very natural i

1835.6 --> 1839.9189999999999
seem to be a fountain just keep on

1838.72 --> 1843.039
talking

1839.919 --> 1843.039
i can do this every day

1843.919 --> 1847.919
i think with goldsmithing i would lose

1846.32 --> 1849.52
that love

1847.919 --> 1851.039
because at first if you haven't

1849.52 --> 1852.48
especially haven't done it in a long

1851.039 --> 1853.84
time there's a lot of ideas and there's

1852.48 --> 1855.44
a whole bunch of things you want to do

1853.84 --> 1857.4399999999998
but if you then

1855.44 --> 1858.88
really make that into your daily

1857.44 --> 1860.24
profession then you have to make

1858.88 --> 1862.48
something every day

1860.24 --> 1865.72
well that inspiration is gonna run out

1862.48 --> 1868.08
for me it did even back then

1865.72 --> 1871.1200000000001
[Music]

1868.08 --> 1872.32
like it is definitely gonna run out and

1871.12 --> 1879.4399999999998
that's why

1872.32 --> 1883.2
that just didn't work out like that

1879.44 --> 1883.2
i'll never really seem to run out of

1890.84 --> 1893.84
words

1898.48 --> 1902.48
all right yeah robin stanley you shared

1900.32 --> 1902.96
that stare that story with me and over

1902.48 --> 1907.44
skype

1902.96 --> 1909.679
i know

1907.44 --> 1913.44
well my parents actually did try to give

1909.679 --> 1913.44
me a whole lot of structure but they

1914.72 --> 1920.64
they i

1917.84 --> 1922.6399999999999
i think they were also afraid of me in

1920.64 --> 1926.159
ways

1922.64 --> 1931.679
because i was so strong spirited i was

1926.159 --> 1931.679
really zealous like zealous zealous

1932.48 --> 1939.679
it yeah like a paladin for real and

1936.48 --> 1943.519
like yeah

1939.679 --> 1946.8400000000001
they weren't they were very much

1943.519 --> 1949.84
about just maneuvering and doing

1946.84 --> 1949.84
whatever

1950.88 --> 1954.72
they were definitely not biblical

1956.72 --> 1963.84
and yeah that just

1964.01 --> 1968.08
[Music]

1965.6 --> 1969.6
i guess in ways i did not respect my

1968.08 --> 1973.84
parents

1969.6 --> 1973.84
i did not respect my parents

1975.44 --> 1982.559
but not because i didn't want to

1979.519 --> 1985.84
it's because i just couldn't

1982.559 --> 1991.2
they just didn't behave

1985.84 --> 1995.039
like respectable parents like in public

1991.2 --> 1998.559
with me there or

1995.039 --> 2001.44
just in their decision-making and

1998.559 --> 2002.32
in their cultural programming like they

2001.44 --> 2004.64
let the tv

2002.32 --> 2006.08
in there they let the liberal [ __ ]

2004.64 --> 2009.76
narrative

2006.08 --> 2011.76
steer us i just latched on to it like

2009.76 --> 2014.72
media responding but yeah i didn't know

2011.76 --> 2016.799
any better they should have known better

2014.72 --> 2018.3990000000001
but they kind of it was too much for

2016.799 --> 2020.799
like the pressure

2018.399 --> 2021.76
of society's manipulations were kind of

2020.799 --> 2024.1589999999999
too strong

2021.76 --> 2026.08
the cohesion of the family spirit was

2024.159 --> 2027.8400000000001
not good enough it wasn't strong enough

2026.08 --> 2029.519
it had already kind of broken between my

2027.84 --> 2031.9189999999999
dad and my mom in ways

2029.519 --> 2033.76
on a personal level wasn't strong enough

2031.919 --> 2037.6000000000001
to basically withstand

2033.76 --> 2037.6
the pressure from the beast

2037.679 --> 2042.0
and then it just started slipping into

2040.399 --> 2044.1589999999999
that

2042.0 --> 2045.76
and i slipped with it in ways even

2044.159 --> 2048.0
though i was still this very

2045.76 --> 2050.56
strong-spirited paladin

2048.0 --> 2052.159
sort of metaphor that kind of thought

2050.56 --> 2053.44
like i'm going to be a paladin of

2052.159 --> 2056.879
society

2053.44 --> 2057.52
so i was basically as a paladin being

2056.879 --> 2060.72
tricked

2057.52 --> 2063.2
to become like yeah a black guard

2060.72 --> 2064.24
for the devil and i didn't see that and

2063.2 --> 2068.6389999999997
also it took me a

2064.24 --> 2074.83
very long time to realize that very long

2068.639 --> 2080.79
too long but i did in the end

2074.83 --> 2080.79
[Music]

2082.399 --> 2087.919
yeah so oh poor old me you know i have

2085.359 --> 2090.48
so many good reasons as to why i live on

2087.919 --> 2093.5989999999997
social welfare even when i'm 40.

2090.48 --> 2094.96
yay if a complete story works doesn't

2093.599 --> 2097.28
really comfort me though

2094.96 --> 2098.4
because just because that happened

2097.28 --> 2101.6800000000003
doesn't mean that i'm

2098.4 --> 2103.839
okay with being in the situation that it

2101.68 --> 2103.839
is

2110.88 --> 2114.4
and i can't escape that despite all

2112.64 --> 2118.0789999999997
those situations it was

2114.4 --> 2122.4
also me in between those situations

2118.079 --> 2124.6400000000003
simply being kind of a coward

2122.4 --> 2124.64
and

2126.4 --> 2133.52
afraid of death also in the wrong times

2131.2 --> 2135.2
like things were too like when you

2133.52 --> 2137.119
really oppose the darkness and the

2135.2 --> 2138.56
darkness then faces you

2137.119 --> 2140.6400000000003
and you don't have a proper

2138.56 --> 2143.119
understanding of how things work

2140.64 --> 2144.0789999999997
then that darkness does definitely touch

2143.119 --> 2146.32
you

2144.079 --> 2149.119
on the on your weaknesses and one of my

2146.32 --> 2149.119
weaknesses was

2156.839 --> 2162.48
fear

2158.88 --> 2162.48
all right any sleeping warrior

2169.2 --> 2173.839
fear of death

2174.48 --> 2177.2
fear of

2180.0 --> 2184.16
either stopping existing and then

2184.24 --> 2187.359
yeah i guess i was afraid of hell in a

2186.72 --> 2189.5989999999997
way

2187.359 --> 2191.68
and that also weirdly relates to we have

2189.599 --> 2194.079
vision situations from even when it was

2191.68 --> 2194.0789999999997
five

2194.64 --> 2197.92
it's yeah

2198.48 --> 2203.92
these things are just like really inner

2200.4 --> 2205.839
spiritual things that

2203.92 --> 2207.599
yeah you can't really tell directly

2205.839 --> 2209.7599999999998
where it's coming from it's just like

2207.599 --> 2213.28
how does an individual respond to

2209.76 --> 2215.76
a situation like as a very young kid

2213.28 --> 2216.88
you know even before i would talk i

2215.76 --> 2219.44
would understand

2216.88 --> 2221.359
very complex things and take them very

2219.44 --> 2224.48
basically take them with me into the

2221.359 --> 2226.64
freaking fourth dimensional experience

2224.48 --> 2228.079
i understood things before people even

2226.64 --> 2231.92
realized that i understood

2228.079 --> 2231.92
things okay

2233.68 --> 2241.7599999999998
and then yeah

2236.72 --> 2241.7599999999998
it just i just grow

2241.839 --> 2246.4
in relation to the experiences even

2244.64 --> 2249.44
though some of them were just messed up

2246.4 --> 2252.4
and there were people out there that

2249.44 --> 2254.0
like they really hated me they really

2252.4 --> 2257.28
hated me for my

2254.0 --> 2258.4
paladin spirit they really really hated

2257.28 --> 2260.6400000000003
me

2258.4 --> 2264.2400000000002
like and as a very little kid you don't

2260.64 --> 2264.24
understand what that does to you

2269.359 --> 2273.7599999999998
that's that's more than just there's a

2271.76 --> 2275.8390000000004
person out there that is deluded

2273.76 --> 2278.6400000000003
by some political reason and then hating

2275.839 --> 2282.0789999999997
on you yeah that sucks

2278.64 --> 2283.44
but as a very little kid if there's like

2282.079 --> 2285.44
adults out there

2283.44 --> 2287.44
you face them in some unforeseen

2285.44 --> 2290.64
situation and it turns out they like

2287.44 --> 2292.64
really personally hate your spirit

2290.64 --> 2293.839
when you're a kid and you don't have the

2292.64 --> 2295.839
defenses you don't even have the

2293.839 --> 2297.839
realization of what the world is

2295.839 --> 2299.119
you don't understand what that does to

2297.839 --> 2300.96
an individual

2299.119 --> 2303.92
it doesn't even have to be any physical

2300.96 --> 2303.92
contact for that

2309.52 --> 2313.44
yeah i've shared that before a situation

2311.44 --> 2315.359
where i was basically kind of

2313.44 --> 2316.88
accidentally they didn't realize like

2315.359 --> 2320.0789999999997
how dangerous it was they kind of

2316.88 --> 2322.6400000000003
left me among uh

2320.079 --> 2324.7200000000003
kid caretakers that didn't even speak my

2322.64 --> 2328.0
language

2324.72 --> 2330.16
in yeah unfamiliar country

2328.0 --> 2331.28
and they i said something wrong and then

2330.16 --> 2334.3999999999996
that those people

2331.28 --> 2337.28
hated me and i couldn't escape

2334.4 --> 2338.2400000000002
i was there in a room with adults that

2337.28 --> 2340.6400000000003
hated me

2338.24 --> 2342.56
and i had to wait there i had to wait

2340.64 --> 2345.56
there i didn't even know how long i

2342.56 --> 2347.2
retrospect it was like eight hours i got

2345.56 --> 2349.68
catatonic

2347.2 --> 2355.839
sitting there waiting i was afraid they

2349.68 --> 2355.839
were gonna kill me

2361.44 --> 2368.32
yeah you know why you know why that was

2365.68 --> 2369.2
because yeah one of these caretaker

2368.32 --> 2372.56
people

2369.2 --> 2373.52
was a black lady and she didn't speak

2372.56 --> 2375.68
english

2373.52 --> 2377.599
or she didn't speak dutch i didn't know

2375.68 --> 2380.7999999999997
the proper words for it

2377.599 --> 2382.96
and i accidentally called her a near

2380.8 --> 2384.7200000000003
yeah because i thought that's just the

2382.96 --> 2386.88
name for a black person and i

2384.72 --> 2388.48
never really met even a black person

2386.88 --> 2391.359
face to face like that

2388.48 --> 2391.92
before afterward you know did when it

2391.359 --> 2395.7599999999998
was like

2391.92 --> 2397.839
five so yeah that is freaking horrible i

2395.76 --> 2397.8390000000004
know

2399.76 --> 2404.8
and i was stuck in there for hours after

2403.599 --> 2407.92
that

2404.8 --> 2410.88
afraid of my [ __ ] life

2407.92 --> 2412.7200000000003
catatonic i've had nightmares of that

2410.88 --> 2415.04
like after that point

2412.72 --> 2417.1189999999997
i associated italy because that's where

2415.04 --> 2420.8
that was in some ski resort

2417.119 --> 2423.04
i associated italy with pure hatred

2420.8 --> 2424.96
literally every time the word italy came

2423.04 --> 2429.359
up i became

2424.96 --> 2435.52
literally for years like four years

2429.359 --> 2435.52
after that now they were not relatives

2436.4 --> 2440.1600000000003
unknown people from that country they

2439.28 --> 2443.76
didn't speak

2440.16 --> 2446.16
dutch never met them before

2443.76 --> 2446.8
and it was like very little and they did

2446.16 --> 2448.64
my parents

2446.8 --> 2450.1600000000003
were afraid to take me with them because

2448.64 --> 2451.52
they were going to go skiing and they

2450.16 --> 2453.04
thought it was going to be too dangerous

2451.52 --> 2456.16
for me and they were right

2453.04 --> 2459.7599999999998
probably but

2456.16 --> 2462.7999999999997
yeah i was just left there was a

2459.76 --> 2464.0
they in a retro they absolutely realized

2462.8 --> 2466.2400000000002
their mistake they knew

2464.0 --> 2468.319
like we should have never done that and

2466.24 --> 2473.52
we're never going to do that again

2468.319 --> 2473.52
for as long as you are still a child

2475.5 --> 2478.59
[Music]

2497.2 --> 2502.1299999999997
anyway yeah that's a kind of a dramatic

2499.76 --> 2504.96
story i guess

2502.13 --> 2507.52
[Music]

2504.96 --> 2508.64
but yeah the whole situation of how it

2507.52 --> 2511.68
worked

2508.64 --> 2513.359
i you know i didn't really respect my

2511.68 --> 2516.7999999999997
parents i knew they were

2513.359 --> 2520.64
trying to do their best

2516.8 --> 2522.48
but i didn't think it was good enough

2520.64 --> 2523.7599999999998
and that's not just like oh they should

2522.48 --> 2527.04
have like invested

2523.76 --> 2527.5200000000004
more in me or no they didn't invest

2527.04 --> 2531.92
enough

2527.52 --> 2537.7599999999998
in their selves they didn't

2531.92 --> 2539.599
they were too naive especially my mother

2537.76 --> 2541.2000000000003
and it's weird because when i was

2539.599 --> 2542.0
starting to grow up when i started to

2541.2 --> 2545.9199999999996
really talk

2542.0 --> 2548.319
like after my 10th i started trying

2545.92 --> 2549.92
addressing

2548.319 --> 2552.24
my mother especially because my dad

2549.92 --> 2554.7200000000003
wasn't even talking that much he was

2552.24 --> 2555.2799999999997
kind of on his own he didn't sit in the

2554.72 --> 2557.52
family

2555.28 --> 2559.119
he was isolating himself like the

2557.52 --> 2560.0
atmosphere was so off and he was

2559.119 --> 2562.839
dwelling

2560.0 --> 2564.96
his own weird little ego things at the

2562.839 --> 2568.64
time

2564.96 --> 2570.079
and i just tried to address it

2568.64 --> 2572.0
and then i realized like the

2570.079 --> 2574.7200000000003
psychological blockages

2572.0 --> 2575.92
that were in place with my mother and my

2574.72 --> 2577.7599999999998
dad too

2575.92 --> 2579.28
though my dad has kind of resolved it

2577.76 --> 2582.1600000000003
now after

2579.28 --> 2582.1600000000003
half a century

2583.359 --> 2591.2799999999997
that yeah there was no way even with

2587.04 --> 2594.48
my inside my paladin powers

2591.28 --> 2596.88
yeah it does that it does things

2594.48 --> 2601.599
i couldn't i i couldn't alter it and it

2596.88 --> 2604.88
i peaked with that attempt when i was 15

2601.599 --> 2607.6800000000003
at vacation i literally spent like

2604.88 --> 2609.28
over yeah several hours spread out

2607.68 --> 2611.52
through the vacation literally

2609.28 --> 2612.88
sitting around the table with my mother

2611.52 --> 2615.599
and father

2612.88 --> 2618.0
and let them be a therapist to them like

2615.599 --> 2619.6800000000003
a very serious therapist because most

2618.0 --> 2621.2
therapists that they've tried to deal

2619.68 --> 2624.48
with and they had already

2621.2 --> 2627.68
were complete [ __ ] retards

2624.48 --> 2630.0
they were worthless scumbags

2627.68 --> 2632.48
and i wanted to kick them in their ass

2630.0 --> 2634.88
like get the [ __ ] out

2632.48 --> 2636.16
and never do that profession again

2634.88 --> 2639.359
you're pathetic

2636.16 --> 2641.839
you're a pathetic useless idiot and you

2639.359 --> 2643.839
should not be paid for that

2641.839 --> 2645.2
because they were worthless they

2643.839 --> 2648.56
couldn't even

2645.2 --> 2651.839
they couldn't even bypass ego tricks

2648.56 --> 2655.119
they were pathetic well i did i

2651.839 --> 2658.0
did a 15 year old kid

2655.119 --> 2658.88
i did and i kind of even had to listen

2658.0 --> 2661.119
to

2658.88 --> 2662.319
them complaining to one another about

2661.119 --> 2664.4
sex things yeah

2662.319 --> 2666.16
well you can imagine there is probably

2664.4 --> 2668.96
nothing more disgusting

2666.16 --> 2669.7599999999998
to a 15 year old than hearing their

2668.96 --> 2671.68
parents

2669.76 --> 2674.079
right next to them not in the next room

2671.68 --> 2677.04
right in front of them

2674.079 --> 2677.6800000000003
lip seeing the lips speak talking about

2677.04 --> 2679.839
sex

2677.68 --> 2681.5989999999997
but i had to do it because it was a big

2679.839 --> 2684.64
problem in their

2681.599 --> 2685.76
ego struggle and i went through it and i

2684.64 --> 2688.96
went through it

2685.76 --> 2690.48
and i broke it i broke it i broke the

2688.96 --> 2694.0
code

2690.48 --> 2697.52
yeah 10 years of stupid family therapy

2694.0 --> 2699.04
blah blah blah useless all useless

2697.52 --> 2700.8
waste of money i wish they gave that

2699.04 --> 2704.0
money to me

2700.8 --> 2707.119
literally that would've been helpful

2704.0 --> 2709.76
a couple of thousand euros

2707.119 --> 2712.0
that they wasted probably on that [ __ ]

2709.76 --> 2715.5200000000004
if they'd let me do it

2712.0 --> 2717.76
they dared then yeah

2715.52 --> 2718.96
i i did fix it you know what the result

2717.76 --> 2722.1600000000003
of that was

2718.96 --> 2722.8
they got divorced and that sucks but you

2722.16 --> 2725.04
know what

2722.8 --> 2727.44
they needed to because it was never

2725.04 --> 2730.319
gonna get fixed again

2727.44 --> 2732.079
they were literally just two egos at war

2730.319 --> 2734.96
and they were never gonna be at peace

2732.079 --> 2737.6800000000003
ever again and they were both gripping

2734.96 --> 2739.2
to the darkness of the outside world

2737.68 --> 2742.3999999999996
suggestions in order to

2739.2 --> 2744.319
reinforce their combat towards their

2742.4 --> 2746.56
one another they were my mother was

2744.319 --> 2749.2799999999997
literally using the [ __ ]

2746.56 --> 2750.7999999999997
of the music of the 90s independent

2749.28 --> 2753.28
woman

2750.8 --> 2756.6400000000003
literally using that [ __ ] against my dad

2753.28 --> 2756.6400000000003
and my dad was being

2757.119 --> 2764.319
like i am the misunderstood victim

2761.76 --> 2766.6400000000003
and i have feelings too and even yeah

2764.319 --> 2769.92
not really being responsible so he has

2766.64 --> 2770.4
had his own typical problems and i broke

2769.92 --> 2773.119
it i

2770.4 --> 2774.0
broke it i made them realize what they

2773.119 --> 2776.7200000000003
were into

2774.0 --> 2776.72
i made them

2777.2 --> 2783.5989999999997
until it's like that drops they

2781.2 --> 2784.319
literally realize who they are where

2783.599 --> 2786.88
they are that

2784.319 --> 2788.24
what they are looking at who they are

2786.88 --> 2790.2400000000002
looking at

2788.24 --> 2792.16
and where are they gonna they literally

2790.24 --> 2795.4399999999996
had that moment it only took

2792.16 --> 2799.2
over a decade and

2795.44 --> 2801.52
yeah their weird little paladin's son

2799.2 --> 2802.72
to kind of do that in order for that to

2801.52 --> 2804.319
be

2802.72 --> 2806.0789999999997
for that to happen and then they

2804.319 --> 2807.119
realized this is never going to work

2806.079 --> 2809.28
again

2807.119 --> 2810.96
or rather my dad realized it's never

2809.28 --> 2812.48
going to work again my mother realizes

2810.96 --> 2814.88
it was never going to work again and

2812.48 --> 2818.16
then basically gave up on life

2814.88 --> 2821.119
because i can be alone

2818.16 --> 2821.1189999999997
because she was weak

2821.44 --> 2826.2400000000002
on a social level she couldn't handle

2824.0 --> 2826.24
that

2828.079 --> 2832.1600000000003
that's also kind of like after that

2829.92 --> 2834.64
point yeah she did get cancer

2832.16 --> 2836.64
and she died she was already on a lot of

2834.64 --> 2838.8799999999997
pharmaceuticals

2836.64 --> 2840.0789999999997
and that yeah from that moment on it

2838.88 --> 2843.44
kind of really

2840.079 --> 2847.3590000000004
went from the lucifer climb to its

2843.44 --> 2847.359
straight tumble down into iron man

2848.319 --> 2859.839
and yeah she died 10 years later

2866.24 --> 2871.2
ah yes intense [ __ ]

2871.68 --> 2874.8799999999997
but i did that and i'm proud and i'm

2873.92 --> 2877.76
also like

2874.88 --> 2878.4
proud that i have this skill to actually

2877.76 --> 2881.3590000000004
[ __ ]

2878.4 --> 2881.92
realize what the hell is going on when

2881.359 --> 2885.48
trained

2881.92 --> 2890.0
professional psychologists were [ __ ]

2885.48 --> 2893.68
incompetent incompetent

2890.0 --> 2898.72
totally incompetent and me a

2893.68 --> 2902.0
not studied not a single [ __ ] book

2898.72 --> 2905.04
a 15 year old unread

2902.0 --> 2908.24
hobby layman psychologist

2905.04 --> 2911.68
fixed his own [ __ ] parents okay

2908.24 --> 2915.839
when professional paid for psychologists

2911.68 --> 2915.839
were useless trash

2918.16 --> 2929.839
and i'm proud of that

2945.359 --> 2952.5589999999997
wow time has flown i'm rambling on about

2949.599 --> 2952.559
family history

2955.28 --> 2958.48
yeah crazy times

2959.04 --> 2962.48
so yeah you know when i share this kind

2961.28 --> 2965.2000000000003
of thing i guess

2962.48 --> 2967.28
it does kind of make everyone including

2965.2 --> 2969.5989999999997
myself even surprisingly in this very

2967.28 --> 2972.6400000000003
moment understand better like

2969.599 --> 2975.6800000000003
yeah i now

2972.64 --> 2978.4
being 40 want me in the past like

2975.68 --> 2979.52
why didn't you get a farming career you

2978.4 --> 2982.96
bastard

2979.52 --> 2985.68
why didn't you do it well yeah then when

2982.96 --> 2987.2
i go step by step through all the shitty

2985.68 --> 2989.44
things that were there

2987.2 --> 2992.24
the opportunities i had i had and i did

2989.44 --> 2993.599
have like contact with farm situations

2992.24 --> 2996.8799999999997
and it did me great i

2993.599 --> 3000.48
loved it i loved being a farmhand

2996.88 --> 3002.4
as a kid i did that like this is sort of

3000.48 --> 3004.48
a therapeutical thing and they had like

3002.4 --> 3005.6800000000003
great organic self-made bread there at

3004.48 --> 3007.52
the farm and all that

3005.68 --> 3009.52
then they were christian which i

3007.52 --> 3012.16
completely didn't understand and was

3009.52 --> 3015.44
still obsessed with atheism

3012.16 --> 3018.24
philosophy and outer space so when that

3015.44 --> 3019.839
kind of came ahead they didn't really it

3018.24 --> 3020.72
didn't really work out anymore i didn't

3019.839 --> 3022.64
understand like

3020.72 --> 3025.52
why can i talk about space with

3022.64 --> 3029.5989999999997
christians come on

3025.52 --> 3029.599
yeah yeah yeah very annoying

3031.52 --> 3035.68
but yeah they just weren't interested

3034.079 --> 3039.599
and it agitated them

3035.68 --> 3041.44
in retrospect i understood why this is

3039.599 --> 3042.96
because they were real christians and

3041.44 --> 3045.28
not just fake

3042.96 --> 3049.04
church following [ __ ] christian that

3045.28 --> 3049.0400000000004
talk about heliocentric crap

3049.359 --> 3052.72
they were real christians

3053.44 --> 3056.559
old-fashioned ones

3056.64 --> 3061.1189999999997
although intellectually not very

3058.319 --> 3062.64
flexible and that was my big problem

3061.119 --> 3064.96
with christianity when i was

3062.64 --> 3066.96
when i was little it's like i want to be

3064.96 --> 3067.76
a christian but why are they all so

3066.96 --> 3071.28
freaking

3067.76 --> 3073.92
inflexible mentally why don't they

3071.28 --> 3076.2400000000002
why is there so little they can talk

3073.92 --> 3076.2400000000002
about

3077.04 --> 3082.48
why don't they want to it's weird to me

3080.8 --> 3084.079
but i don't even know if these types of

3082.48 --> 3087.599
christians still exist you know

3084.079 --> 3087.599
that was before the internet

3091.839 --> 3096.0
but yeah it just i i it didn't work i

3095.52 --> 3099.04
couldn't

3096.0 --> 3100.88
have i couldn't have done that with

3099.04 --> 3103.92
everything that i had been facing and

3100.88 --> 3107.52
the ideas that have slipped in

3103.92 --> 3108.319
the like this weird quest world-sized

3107.52 --> 3110.72
quest like

3108.319 --> 3111.7599999999998
the world is [ __ ] up i i've realized

3110.72 --> 3115.5989999999997
this now i have to

3111.76 --> 3118.079
fight to survive

3115.599 --> 3119.2000000000003
the way i am with like my spirit the

3118.079 --> 3122.6400000000003
flame of honor

3119.2 --> 3126.8799999999997
the yeah the paladin nature whatever

3122.64 --> 3129.52
i have to uphold this

3126.88 --> 3131.76
and i don't even know for sure why but i

3129.52 --> 3136.079
feel like i have to it's like

3131.76 --> 3136.079
it's so unique i have to do that it's so

3136.839 --> 3140.48
important even though it just seems to

3139.2 --> 3144.16
get in my way of

3140.48 --> 3144.16
being pragmatic a lot of the time

3144.64 --> 3149.2799999999997
but then yeah when i think about it a

3147.599 --> 3152.2400000000002
lot more then it's

3149.28 --> 3153.119
real pragmatism is not really pragmatism

3152.24 --> 3156.7999999999997
it's just

3153.119 --> 3156.8
short-sighted pragmatism

3159.52 --> 3165.04
it's sacrificial pragmatism and i've

3162.0 --> 3165.04
never been about that

3165.96 --> 3173.65
[Music]

3178.839 --> 3182.88
hmm

3180.8 --> 3185.119
i'm a well strong man what does that

3182.88 --> 3185.119
mean

3185.28 --> 3195.8390000000004
oh paypal i'll check it out

3188.88 --> 3195.839
thank you guns have never owned rmp

3202.079 --> 3208.7200000000003
wow thank you very much

3205.599 --> 3211.04
thank you very much man that's this is

3208.72 --> 3211.04
good

3213.04 --> 3220.16
yeah like i think two more of those

3218.0 --> 3221.599
not saying you now right now and like

3220.16 --> 3223.52
the issue with my

3221.599 --> 3227.3590000000004
rent that's going to be retracted next

3223.52 --> 3237.839
month will probably be

3227.359 --> 3237.839
even that's good

3240.72 --> 3251.839
right yeah paladin that's where

3244.48 --> 3251.839
that's where it originated from it's

3253.52 --> 3260.4
now i do pride myself to be

3257.119 --> 3262.0
at least in manners chivalrous and i did

3260.4 --> 3264.1600000000003
that to myself

3262.0 --> 3265.119
like my parents didn't even teach me to

3264.16 --> 3268.3999999999996
do that no i

3265.119 --> 3270.8
wanted that i wanted to be chill for us

3268.4 --> 3271.359
i loved it i loved every time somebody

3270.8 --> 3275.28
did that

3271.359 --> 3277.839
it's just oh yes

3275.28 --> 3278.3190000000004
it was mine shivering was mine so that

3277.839 --> 3283.359
is

3278.319 --> 3283.359
in there now when it comes to heroism

3283.92 --> 3289.119
it's just difficult you know back then

3287.119 --> 3290.0
the world was a different place in many

3289.119 --> 3292.559
ways

3290.0 --> 3293.68
and there was a lot of combat and combat

3292.559 --> 3296.1600000000003
was very scary

3293.68 --> 3299.2799999999997
and then yeah you could be heroic if you

3296.16 --> 3302.96
were just fearless in battle

3299.28 --> 3304.6400000000003
and could still maintain your clarity as

3302.96 --> 3305.119
to not accidentally kill the wrong

3304.64 --> 3308.24
people

3305.119 --> 3311.2000000000003
[ __ ] in some frenzy yeah that that would

3308.24 --> 3314.24
probably have been considered heroism

3311.2 --> 3316.96
nowadays heroism is just too complex

3314.24 --> 3320.3999999999996
because straightforward fearlessness

3316.96 --> 3324.88
often leads to traps

3320.4 --> 3326.7200000000003
so i don't know if i completely abide by

3324.88 --> 3327.839
the old-fashioned standard of the

3326.72 --> 3331.68
original

3327.839 --> 3331.68
paladin of charlemagne's court

3332.96 --> 3349.839
what i i do aspire to a little

3338.4 --> 3349.839
at least in thought

3350.319 --> 3356.079
right that's right

3353.599 --> 3358.0
destroyer of evil yeah and there is a

3356.079 --> 3360.4
bit of an issue there as well because i

3358.0 --> 3364.319
think i have that part in me

3360.4 --> 3369.359
like i want to i want to go at it

3364.319 --> 3371.52
so i said it's like violent thoughts

3369.359 --> 3373.839
it sounds so bad when you just say it

3371.52 --> 3377.28
like that but it's not

3373.839 --> 3381.68
it's not just random [ __ ] it's

3377.28 --> 3390.079
not just random revenge on the weak

3381.68 --> 3393.6499999999996
you know

3390.079 --> 3395.04
trying to set things right that are just

3393.65 --> 3400.0
[Music]

3395.04 --> 3400.0
that could be you know that's

3402.839 --> 3405.839
anyway

3415.599 --> 3421.04
right but also for me it's also

3418.72 --> 3422.24
i've also very much and this is even my

3421.04 --> 3426.319
entry point

3422.24 --> 3426.319
for how the darkness tried to lure me in

3426.559 --> 3430.559
trying to understand the evil and why it

3429.44 --> 3433.04
is there

3430.559 --> 3434.559
what the meaning of it is in creation

3433.04 --> 3437.68
why does that happen

3434.559 --> 3438.6400000000003
like really trying to understand not the

3437.68 --> 3442.5589999999997
individual

3438.64 --> 3447.44
and their choices because

3442.559 --> 3450.7200000000003
but just why it is there

3447.44 --> 3452.079
what does it mean and what are the

3450.72 --> 3455.2
consequences of

3452.079 --> 3457.2000000000003
trying to negate it as it were the real

3455.2 --> 3458.72
thing

3457.2 --> 3460.64
because i think there's a real big

3458.72 --> 3463.359
puzzle there and it's mystified me in

3460.64 --> 3463.359
many ways

3464.799 --> 3469.68
it's like even reflected in my in my

3466.96 --> 3475.839
dark world experience

3469.68 --> 3475.839
like i almost felt like

3478.0 --> 3489.839
never mind

3512.24 --> 3518.4799999999996
all right oh show time's almost over i

3515.92 --> 3518.48
went quick

3518.72 --> 3523.04
all right but yeah i i can't say it i

3522.64 --> 3527.2799999999997
think

3523.04 --> 3527.2799999999997
it's i guess that

3527.76 --> 3531.599
and this is something that in a way like

3529.44 --> 3534.96
creeped onto me through the dark world

3531.599 --> 3534.96
experience itself is that

3535.04 --> 3540.079
i do realize like yeah i understand

3537.76 --> 3541.3590000000004
creation and the creator and the design

3540.079 --> 3543.8390000000004
and the function

3541.359 --> 3546.319
the the crystal of all things the

3543.839 --> 3546.319
pattern

3546.559 --> 3555.2000000000003
but then yeah my

3550.4 --> 3559.76
my individual my fragment part of it all

3555.2 --> 3564.319
has an ego and it is kind of like

3559.76 --> 3568.96
resentful towards

3564.319 --> 3568.96
the creator it seems and

3570.319 --> 3575.839
like there's yeah this this

3573.52 --> 3575.839
little
