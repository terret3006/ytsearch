2.689 --> 10.05
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

6.72 --> 16.529
early-bird number 61 I'm your host

10.05 --> 21.84
Arwen and today today is a lot sunnier

16.529 --> 26.759999999999998
so I'm relieved to say that I feel quite

21.84 --> 31.22
a lot better it's nice and sunny and

26.76 --> 31.220000000000002
I've been soaking up some of that Sun

31.43 --> 39.559
yeah Wow watched yesterday's hangout

35.969 --> 39.559
back and that was just crazy

49.31 --> 54.31
I don't really know what to think about

51.47 --> 54.31
it anyway

56.9 --> 60.01
is what it is

60.1 --> 65.46000000000001
and yeah I did go a little bit far but I

65.67 --> 73.03
the only thing that I really object is I

70.83 --> 77.46
could have done it better

73.03 --> 77.46000000000001
y-yeah never good enough for me

78.6 --> 88.05
yeah like Daniel says it's okay to freak

81.82 --> 88.05
out every now and then and I do and

92.61 --> 98.219
result

94.979 --> 101.15899999999999
it's freaky but like lots of people have

98.219 --> 104.28
been throwing making it worse actually

101.159 --> 109.77000000000001
they didn't really intend to it getting

104.28 --> 116.43900000000001
more scenarios not even go and go into

109.77 --> 120.46
that but yeah I yeah

116.439 --> 123.189
why do I start okay apparently Lottie

120.46 --> 126.63999999999999
was going to try to help me to get a

123.189 --> 130.179
hundred subscribers or so and it seems

126.64 --> 133.209
like he tried but yeah YouTube just

130.179 --> 137.01
doesn't allow it because I went up to

133.209 --> 141.4
what is it nine hundred seventy four and

137.01 --> 143.97
then it went straight back down straight

141.4 --> 147.75
back bang

143.97 --> 153.579
although yeah I did apparently get some

147.75 --> 155.709
new subscribers that stay for now at

153.579 --> 161.23000000000002
least I don't know I don't know what's

155.709 --> 163.84
going on I got 927 right now but yeah I

161.23 --> 168.51899999999998
guess it's something so thank you all

163.84 --> 171.34
for subscribing and hope to bring a

168.519 --> 175.299
little bit more constructive material to

171.34 --> 179.53
the show now also one thing that kind of

175.299 --> 182.31900000000002
was remarkable to me is that yeah

179.53 --> 185.349
somebody did donate to me over PayPal

182.319 --> 191.13
and I was quite surprised about that

185.349 --> 195.57899999999998
so that was Ronnie fashi actually and he

191.13 --> 197.2
yeah he sent little over 10 euros to me

195.579 --> 200.22
so thank you a lot

197.2 --> 203.16899999999998
Ronnie fashi thank you a lot for that

200.22 --> 210.09
really appreciate it couldn't have been

203.169 --> 210.09
timed better really and well

210.34 --> 216.92000000000002
it certainly did make up for my

214.43 --> 219.5
complaint that I've done all of this for

216.92 --> 225.95
another sense well I can't say that any

219.5 --> 229.99
more now so I guess thank you it's good

225.95 --> 229.98999999999998
it really did

233.45 --> 239.569
it did kind of help stop the breakdown

236.89 --> 243.23
really did so thank you for that if you

239.569 --> 247.069
want you can come on the show I gave you

243.23 --> 251.26899999999998
a link in the chat so if you want to be

247.069 --> 254.82999999999998
on you're welcome to come right now or

251.269 --> 254.83
stay in check whatever you like

257.62 --> 260.37
hmm

260.68 --> 266.59000000000003
all right people are talking it's

262.66 --> 269.71000000000004
supposed to be grown all right

266.59 --> 274.75
okay so I guess people are trying again

269.71 --> 277.23999999999995
I wish you the best of luck but yeah

274.75 --> 278.889
I'll bet you I'm not gonna bet any money

277.24 --> 283.509
because I don't have any but I'll bet

278.889 --> 286.539
you that before the before the next four

283.509 --> 289.03000000000003
hours have passed it'll be right back

286.539 --> 294.03
where it started because Google doesn't

289.03 --> 294.03
allow me to have sucks subscribe to me

294.21 --> 299.19899999999996
well yeah regular real subscribers can't

298.3 --> 302.05
really stop that

299.199 --> 306.759
I see flash burn 52 thank you for

302.05 --> 312.99
subscribing real subscribers do actually

306.759 --> 312.99
stay so thank you guys

317.35 --> 324.64000000000004
all right so yes Jessica on the latitude

322.48 --> 327.16
and longitude does work on the Flat

324.64 --> 329.71
Earth Map whatever that's supposed to

327.16 --> 331.6
mean all maps are projections and you

329.71 --> 334.83
might have noticed that all projections

331.6 --> 334.83000000000004
on maps are flat

339.99 --> 347.669
yeah animals and tank filled Jesus

344.88 --> 350.3
already had 12 subs that's funny that's

347.669 --> 350.29999999999995
really funny

356.61 --> 364.05
okay well thank you all for trying to

361.77 --> 367.25899999999996
help me get there be nice

364.05 --> 370.65000000000003
sooner the better so I'm not complaining

367.259 --> 376.039
but again yeah this is quick subscriber

370.65 --> 380.28
growing it tends to just be rolled back

376.039 --> 382.62
after a while usually that takes like a

380.28 --> 386.00899999999996
year or something but now it's just like

382.62 --> 390.08
no not this guy no no no our wins not

386.009 --> 395.449
getting is it's also subscribers so just

390.08 --> 395.44899999999996
remove them all again you know

421.249 --> 427.86
interesting we'll see where it goes so

425.249 --> 432.23900000000003
yeah I am NOT gonna be raging today

427.86 --> 435.119
thank God over that the issues that I

432.239 --> 440.339
raised about still stands and though I

435.119 --> 443.84900000000005
got the most annoying or annoyed about

440.339 --> 446.089
my subscriber count yeah that's as I

443.849 --> 448.199
said it's just one drop on the plates

446.089 --> 452.129
compared to all the other things that I

448.199 --> 457.939
also said make me human nature and the

452.129 --> 460.439
set up of this world and our design is

457.939 --> 469.61
driving everything to destruction

460.439 --> 469.61
it seems so yeah lots of complaints but

470.46 --> 476.84
I will get back to that the funny thing

473.19 --> 476.84
is and it always is that

481.13 --> 488.65999999999997
from all the evil secrets that are kept

484.1 --> 491.0
from us that we are good getting touched

488.66 --> 499.3
touching upon through alternative media

491.0 --> 503.53
and all the stuff you have to be you say

499.3 --> 507.05
reasonable or yeah reasonable about

503.53 --> 509.78
reality in the sense that there may

507.05 --> 512.11
definitely also be good things hidden

509.78 --> 516.67
from us

512.11 --> 520.57
and not not even necessarily to keep

516.67 --> 525.1899999999999
keep it out of our hands but maybe to

520.57 --> 528.5500000000001
save it you know for example the whole

525.19 --> 530.7700000000001
seed vault thing at the Arctic or

528.55 --> 532.9599999999999
whatever that was was that Norway or

530.77 --> 536.23
something or I don't know where it was

532.96 --> 538.87
again was in a very cold region it was

536.23 --> 544.9300000000001
the enter I don't remember but that's

538.87 --> 547.72
one thing that's really helpful and I've

544.93 --> 551.17
been thinking yeah what's with that with

547.72 --> 555.19
really advanced technology what's to

551.17 --> 557.68
stop elites from building giant or

555.19 --> 561.9100000000001
digging out or maybe occupying natural

557.68 --> 565.65
caverns trying to make them earthquake

561.91 --> 569.02
proof and then building internal

565.65 --> 572.68
ecosystems in there with artificial suns

569.02 --> 576.55
and just injecting a miniature ecosystem

572.68 --> 579.52
kind of like the what is it the the dome

576.55 --> 581.14
thing that was try to think in the 90s

579.52 --> 584.11
or something it didn't really work out

581.14 --> 589.6899999999999
all that well but yeah it seemed like it

584.11 --> 593.2
was sabotage maybe but maybe in a larger

589.69 --> 595.69
natural cavern with with with an

593.2 --> 598.1500000000001
artificial Sun cycle and everything yeah

595.69 --> 602.11
it could work if it is large enough if

598.15 --> 604.12
there's actually wildlife there and

602.11 --> 607.1800000000001
everything and

604.12 --> 610.33
not just humans taking care of gardens

607.18 --> 615.52
and all that but more bigger might work

610.33 --> 618.34
maybe that is out there to conserve what

615.52 --> 622.27
is out there now that is being

618.34 --> 629.08
endangered either by mankind or by the

622.27 --> 633.8199999999999
cycle of the Sun because is there

629.08 --> 638.64
another miniature Ice Age coming like in

633.82 --> 638.6400000000001
the Renaissance era or

642.95 --> 649.26
or isn't there well we'll find out one

646.71 --> 652.07
way or the other but if there is and

649.26 --> 655.86
there is talk of it and then also just

652.07 --> 657.9300000000001
the studying of solar activities and all

655.86 --> 661.5600000000001
that yeah even if you're gonna approach

657.93 --> 663.51
it Helia heliocentric wise and yeah the

661.56 --> 666.5699999999999
ones that put out the information about

663.51 --> 669.51
this tend to do that the data is still

666.57 --> 673.2900000000001
what it is so if there is a solar

669.51 --> 680.0
minimum approaching and might dip down

673.29 --> 683.4
to levels we can't yet understand

680.0 --> 687.12
yeah then nature could be in trouble all

683.4 --> 691.05
by itself you know could be a big

687.12 --> 694.38
problem so I don't know may and that's

691.05 --> 697.0799999999999
the other angle of reasoning again and

694.38 --> 703.89
it still pisses me off though it still

697.08 --> 707.01
does but yeah maybe the elites know it's

703.89 --> 709.98
coming they know it can't really be

707.01 --> 714.78
prevented from being destroyed so that

709.98 --> 718.38
just well try to conserve some of it in

714.78 --> 720.78
secret and just ignore it from that

718.38 --> 723.42
point on just either black man destroy

720.78 --> 727.4599999999999
it or let nature destroy it maybe

723.42 --> 727.4599999999999
something like that it is pretty

727.8 --> 739.05
heartwrenching either way if that is the

732.43 --> 739.05
case but it does give more practice

742.899 --> 747.449
you see that flash that was

750.36 --> 760.5790000000001
okay no idea where that came from but

756.199 --> 763.049
yeah it would seem a little bit more

760.579 --> 764.929
pragmatic than just yeah I'll just

763.049 --> 773.429
destroy it we're all gonna die anyway

764.929 --> 775.079
that kind of approach so who knows all I

773.429 --> 776.819
know it's not making me feel very

775.079 --> 778.769
comfortable make me feel very

776.819 --> 785.269
uncomfortable especially about my

778.769 --> 792.149
situation because yeah living minimally

785.269 --> 796.199
just passing through nature on the

792.149 --> 799.079
natural energies is that even possible

796.199 --> 804.41
if there would be a solar minimum or

799.079 --> 804.41
would I not survive I I fear the worst

805.999 --> 810.739
but maybe that is just

811.07 --> 820.13
maybe it's just weakness maybe I really

815.98 --> 822.5600000000001
should just try to dissolve this fear

820.13 --> 828.639
and just really do trust God and really

822.56 --> 833.63
do trust that spiritual energies mana

828.639 --> 836.839
serenity can bring you even through the

833.63 --> 841.49
darkest of times including when nature

836.839 --> 845.9300000000001
itself turns against everything maybe it

841.49 --> 848.149
can be done I don't know I hope so but I

845.93 --> 854.5999999999999
still feel like Oh God

848.149 --> 856.81
I need to somehow advance somewhat get a

854.6 --> 860.36
little bit more grip

856.81 --> 863.93
maybe it's because I'm approaching 40 it

860.36 --> 867.589
could be just I feel like yeah I I don't

863.93 --> 870.79
have enough but it's a strong impulse

867.589 --> 876.74
that I probably need a little bit more

870.79 --> 882.41
to secure my future and the future of

876.74 --> 884.9590000000001
what I'm working on my heritage for

882.41 --> 887.63
whatever that's worth intellectual

884.959 --> 892.25
heritage I don't know you know in times

887.63 --> 896.24
of great stress all this stuff is all

892.25 --> 898.899
luxury it is it's not going to be very

896.24 --> 898.899
welcome

901.27 --> 909.13
that's just a big problem of stressful

905.529 --> 915.33
times in general is that uniformity

909.13 --> 920.05
becomes prioritized over truth out of a

915.33 --> 924.279
instinctive drive a necessity to

920.05 --> 927.149
cooperate to survive with with the

924.279 --> 931.5889999999999
larger group and that means that anyone

927.149 --> 934.54
even for good reasons if they would be

931.589 --> 938.7700000000001
going against the grain in such times

934.54 --> 941.55
they would be they would be seen as a

938.77 --> 944.55
detriment even if it is the truth and

941.55 --> 948.91
right now that doesn't seem to really be

944.55 --> 952.0889999999999
the case at this point but who says it's

948.91 --> 955.68
gonna stay like this again things are

952.089 --> 955.6800000000001
going to change for the worse then

957.22 --> 964.5500000000001
yeah well we'd be in danger but not just

961.01 --> 966.79
us God look at all those nut cases out

964.55 --> 968.53
there in the world right now they've

966.79 --> 971.66
completely doomed

968.53 --> 977.35
they're exactly as doomed as they think

971.66 --> 977.35
they are and yeah so

977.99 --> 986.529
but I feared that it wouldn't stop with

980.48 --> 993.35
just them I don't know what to do really

986.529 --> 995.77
just know that I need to somehow be able

993.35 --> 995.77
to

999.93 --> 1004.2399999999999
what's the word let me think let me look

1002.06 --> 1004.2399999999999
up

1009.04 --> 1012.4499999999999
I think it's yeah

1014.6 --> 1021.41
yeah I guess responsibility or

1016.79 --> 1026.03
accountability I need to be I need to

1021.41 --> 1028.3999999999999
show that I am NOT just a guy of all

1026.03 --> 1031.61
talk and do nothing and that I'm

1028.4 --> 1036.02
basically a hypocrite because of that I

1031.61 --> 1038.36
need to work on things I need to be

1036.02 --> 1042.32
careful not to destroy everything I've

1038.36 --> 1045.3799999999999
built spiritually to get there at the

1042.32 --> 1047.78
same time and I think I can even through

1045.38 --> 1051.3200000000002
YouTube it seems there are some angles I

1047.78 --> 1054.37
have a wide interest in nature and in

1051.32 --> 1058.87
physics I think things can be done I

1054.37 --> 1064.4199999999998
could do things that will have will be

1058.87 --> 1067.9699999999998
considered as valuable so that I may

1064.42 --> 1069.73
account myself for existing misery

1067.97 --> 1073.01
towards the world

1069.73 --> 1078.4
so I do have a chance at that I'm gonna

1073.01 --> 1078.4
just can't walk away anymore

1080.6 --> 1088.759
just calm it today so yeah lots of

1087.019 --> 1092.72
people in Chadha had a very long

1088.759 --> 1096.59
discussion before a couple of people and

1092.72 --> 1100.22
was a little agitated as well discussion

1096.59 --> 1104.24
with Daniel and with Ragnar's Stefan

1100.22 --> 1106.759
Alderson and he claims that Riley is a

1104.24 --> 1110.0
baller or rather not a flat earther

1106.759 --> 1114.169
because he said I'm because he said the

1110.0 --> 1118.039
baseline I don't believe it's about the

1114.169 --> 1121.429
size that is claimed it is to be and

1118.039 --> 1126.22
that's annoying because it's just not

Oh Matson

1314.83 --> 1318.21
a-alex quaint

1321.6 --> 1329.28
so yeah let's see where my subscribers

1325.68 --> 1336.1100000000001
are at Wow

1329.28 --> 1336.11
okay its 975 again interesting

1347.25 --> 1350.93
oh yeah got my

1354.37 --> 1364.1499999999999
I had my checks that my chat stuck

1360.18 --> 1366.46
anyway yeah it's hard to see that

1364.15 --> 1368.47
sometimes that there's a chat next to

1366.46 --> 1371.41
the YouTube but I got a chat separately

1368.47 --> 1374.44
in a separate box the same chat but if I

1371.41 --> 1376.3600000000001
scroll that one like this then everyone

1374.44 --> 1378.49
gets to see that and if I forget to

1376.36 --> 1381.52
scroll it back then it stays stuck where

1378.49 --> 1384.57
I scrolled it to so that's gonna keep

1381.52 --> 1384.57
paying attention to that

1388.78 --> 1396.55
right Alex quaint that's funny that you

1391.99 --> 1398.2
say that because yeah you might be

1396.55 --> 1402.28
joking and joking about that right now

1398.2 --> 1407.5
but maybe this year let's say for

1402.28 --> 1411.25
example in January Europe YouTube might

1407.5 --> 1415.3
suddenly just choose the to actually do

1411.25 --> 1417.69
change the minimum requirement to 5000

1415.3 --> 1422.35
subscribers wouldn't that be something

1417.69 --> 1426.69
wouldn't that just be something hmm so

1422.35 --> 1426.6899999999998
we'll see we'll see

1432.52 --> 1441.1
my subs are swinging back again yep told

1437.02 --> 1444.72
you guys told you it's now nine hundred

1441.1 --> 1450.3
269 it'll be back right where it started

1444.72 --> 1450.3
could even get back to 917

1456.91 --> 1461.3500000000001
yep

1458.8 --> 1463.4199999999998
now if you guys want to help me out then

1461.35 --> 1467.56
you're gonna have to find people with

1463.42 --> 1470.29
actual channels that are willing to

1467.56 --> 1474.94
subscribe to me real people because no

1470.29 --> 1478.33
socks it's just instant delete my

1474.94 --> 1481.77
channel no they're not gonna make it

1478.33 --> 1484.6
easy for me not at all not even close

1481.77 --> 1486.49
so if you want to help out then you're

1484.6 --> 1490.78
gonna have to really scrap the show to

1486.49 --> 1494.11
real other people and convince them to

1490.78 --> 1498.42
subscribe to me because yeah sucks

1494.11 --> 1498.4199999999998
they've just washed away instantly

1513.44 --> 1522.5800000000002
so I was kind of expecting Constance to

1519.65 --> 1525.44
come on the show now she said she would

1522.58 --> 1528.55
well she hasn't shown up yet Oh

1525.44 --> 1528.55
anything is okay

1531.89 --> 1539.8100000000002
it is Wednesday she said she could join

1535.76 --> 1542.59
Wednesday so we'll see maybe she had a

1539.81 --> 1542.59
bit of a late night

1570.44 --> 1579.63
[ __ ] you gotta be happy but I just told

1575.97 --> 1586.159
you it's all gonna be erased again very

1579.63 --> 1586.159
quickly it's being done right as I speak

1591.69 --> 1603.1200000000001
oh okay it's back to 974 Wow

1597.919 --> 1610.6200000000001
the Arwen sub market is fluctuating

1603.12 --> 1614.029
wildly the market is unstable people are

1610.62 --> 1621.6589999999999
subscribing and being unsubscribe

1614.029 --> 1626.879
irregular erratic fashion thanks for a

1621.659 --> 1629.909
Riesling Alex quaint see I told you guys

1626.879 --> 1632.549
it does happen I don't say it for

1629.909 --> 1634.0490000000002
nothing if you have been subscribed if

1632.549 --> 1637.679
you think you are subscribed to my

1634.049 --> 1640.649
channel then check it check it every now

1637.679 --> 1644.519
and then maybe every day because you

1640.649 --> 1646.799
will just on the unsubscribe without you

1644.519 --> 1649.44
actually having done that it does happen

1646.799 --> 1651.389
it not just happens to sucks they get

1649.44 --> 1655.289
removed instantly but other people seem

1651.389 --> 1657.6
to be dropping just randomly people that

1655.289 --> 1661.049
potentially watch every day or almost

1657.6 --> 1663.779
every day so yeah thanks you too thank

1661.049 --> 1669.71
you so much for helping me out you've

1663.779 --> 1669.71
been great thanks

1675.7 --> 1679.8890000000001
what yeah who knows what's gonna happen

1691.69 --> 1696.46
972 told you

1705.32 --> 1712.1699999999998
maybe some big guy put put options on my

1709.49 --> 1716.19
sub-account so he's now actually

1712.17 --> 1718.17
investing in algorithm changes to

1716.19 --> 1721.0700000000002
prevent me from ever getting to a

1718.17 --> 1721.0700000000002
thousand subscribers

1726.42 --> 1734.74
all right well if you don't get unsubbed

1731.64 --> 1741.88
good for you it does happen to some

1734.74 --> 1743.41
people so yeah and not just some a lot

1741.88 --> 1748.2700000000002
of people a lot of people that I have

1743.41 --> 1750.8200000000002
known come back get back at bet get back

1748.27 --> 1753.67
to me just tell me hey for some reason I

1750.82 --> 1757.62
was unsubscribed happened to a lot of

1753.67 --> 1757.6200000000001
people so

1758.73 --> 1765.9
see L&B not unsubscribe so yeah

1767.28 --> 1773.46
alright okay a music man you may ask a

1770.1 --> 1778.98
question what is it by the way the panel

1773.46 --> 1781.32
is still open so not open to the chat

1778.98 --> 1783.66
but open through Skype so if anyone

1781.32 --> 1786.59
wants to join you know what to do the

1783.66 --> 1786.5900000000001
link is out there

1793.31 --> 1797.47
so our music men what is your question

1814.99 --> 1827.83
Wow it says SEP 976 again I think I

1824.95 --> 1829.72
think where we've broken the algorithm I

1827.83 --> 1832.77
think it might have been a core

1829.72 --> 1835.75
condition for the algorithm to function

1832.77 --> 1839.32
until I hit the thousand subscribers so

1835.75 --> 1840.73
everything in its power is being done to

1839.32 --> 1843.309
prevent that from happening because

1840.73 --> 1845.88
after that YouTube is going to break

1843.309 --> 1849.33
maybe that's it

1845.88 --> 1849.3300000000002
what do you guys think

1871.399 --> 1873.549
yeah

1877.97 --> 1888.409
anyway yeah thank you guys for it for

1881.99 --> 1892.45
helping me out go there 981 it's never

1888.409 --> 1892.45
been that high before that's interesting

1893.35 --> 1898.389
this keeps up I might actually attempt

1899.62 --> 1906.2589999999998
to start yeah to request monetization

1903.519 --> 1910.25
this could be interesting you know it

1906.259 --> 1913.1
yeah that's gonna work out I'll need to

1910.25 --> 1915.049
keep and once it's it's 2,000

1913.1 --> 1921.11
subscribers I'll actually need to keep

1915.049 --> 1924.37
it there so what interesting thanks

1921.11 --> 1924.37
everyone for helping out

1928.75 --> 1933.9
I wish constants would join me

1935.08 --> 1942.24
I think she's away from the keyboard or

1938.11 --> 1942.24
something that

1948.18 --> 1951.77
so what have I been doing

1952.97 --> 1958.15
oh yeah this is really typical

1962.45 --> 1969.6190000000001
things sometimes that I get to see

1964.789 --> 1972.369
through media things that are pushed

1969.619 --> 1976.509
through several angles in media say

1972.369 --> 1981.639
advertisement but also through what

1976.509 --> 1986.029
media program hosts do during their show

1981.639 --> 1990.049
and I got this weird weird [ __ ]

1986.029 --> 1993.889
happening in relation to beer like

1990.049 --> 1996.35
really weird stuff what was it again the

1993.889 --> 1998.9889999999998
weirdest probably was that that

1996.35 --> 2000.789
politician woman from the US that that

1998.989 --> 2004.659
woman that's completely out of touch

2000.789 --> 2008.019
with reality and she was in some sort of

2004.659 --> 2011.3790000000001
blog drinking and he's like just having

2008.019 --> 2014.71
a beer and she drank it the most awkward

2011.379 --> 2017.2199999999998
way you could like with the entire tube

2014.71 --> 2020.799
in her mouth it was so weird and

2017.22 --> 2025.8990000000001
everybody talked about beer and yeah so

2020.799 --> 2028.269
I had three beers yesterday and not to

2025.899 --> 2030.6
say it actually kind of helped against

2028.269 --> 2030.6
the rage

2031.32 --> 2037.35
because I could just in that moment just

2034.38 --> 2041.19
kind of let it go just let it move away

2037.35 --> 2043.56
and just let it sink and I don't know I

2041.19 --> 2046.6200000000001
don't know if I could say it was the

2043.56 --> 2048.39
beer but I feel a little bit better it's

2046.62 --> 2053.2799999999997
not it's cool it was completely

2048.39 --> 2057.95
different to like was it during around

2053.28 --> 2061.98
Christmas time I had beer like 2 times

2057.95 --> 2065.16
then and every time it felt really bad

2061.98 --> 2067.86
it felt down really bad it hit in the

2065.16 --> 2069.81
wrong way I thought good it's just no it

2067.86 --> 2073.5
kind of stopped that but yeah yesterday

2069.81 --> 2077.2799999999997
was like completely different totally

2073.5 --> 2080.429
the opposite so it was odd so again all

2077.28 --> 2082.65
this weird synchronicity the

2080.429 --> 2087.3
synchronicity seems to be haunting me

2082.65 --> 2089.52
almost stalking me sometimes like you

2087.3 --> 2091.1690000000003
know there's just basic synchronicity

2089.52 --> 2094.02
stuff like hey you're thinking of

2091.169 --> 2096.45
somebody and then they write at that

2094.02 --> 2098.52
moment they call you up by phone ok

2096.45 --> 2102.39
that's one thing but when you have like

2098.52 --> 2105.63
themed synchronicity through media that

2102.39 --> 2107.8799999999997
is really freaky that really freaks me

2105.63 --> 2111.12
out every time and I haven't even

2107.88 --> 2113.13
mentioned like the creepiest of examples

2111.12 --> 2115.5
that I've experienced in the last two

2113.13 --> 2118.2000000000003
years because I just don't want to I

2115.5 --> 2123.47
don't want to talk about that in the

2118.2 --> 2126.66
open it's like really freaky stuff that

2123.47 --> 2129.22
would drive any person any person just

2126.66 --> 2137.7999999999997
nuts to witness

2129.22 --> 2143.1299999999997
that when a wider a wider thing that is

2137.8 --> 2147.4
going on in the world seems to be like

2143.13 --> 2151.15
unnaturally reflecting detailed thinks

2147.4 --> 2153.67
that I would be doing right then just in

2151.15 --> 2156.46
detail and it was every time that

2153.67 --> 2158.41
happens it's so out of place and any

2156.46 --> 2160.869
outsider that would see it would

2158.41 --> 2164.77
probably think okay that is awkward why

2160.869 --> 2167.59
did they do that okay but sure but for

2164.77 --> 2170.2599999999998
me it's like why are you freaking

2167.59 --> 2174.099
reflecting my life like this to me it is

2170.26 --> 2178.3900000000003
terrifying it is terrifying to see that

2174.099 --> 2182.98
freaks me out so yeah I'm gonna name

2178.39 --> 2186.5699999999997
names but the weirdest [ __ ] happens to

2182.98 --> 2188.92
me and this bear thing what seems to be

2186.57 --> 2191.59
just another one of these weird things

2188.92 --> 2194.26
like why are people raise this bear

2191.59 --> 2198.4900000000002
thing now happening why is it being high

2194.26 --> 2201.1600000000003
poison being weird the trend made trendy

2198.49 --> 2202.6299999999997
or something and then I drink a couple

2201.16 --> 2207.67
of beers and it's great and I feel

2202.63 --> 2210.01
better and it's just like okay you can't

2207.67 --> 2214.21
be seriously telling me that that was

2210.01 --> 2217.1800000000003
actually God or the world's conveying to

2214.21 --> 2218.83
me that I was supposed to drink beer or

2217.18 --> 2222.8999999999996
something see what I mean

2218.83 --> 2222.9
see how freakin weird that is

2226.61 --> 2233.2400000000002
anyway I had a couple of beers 303 was

2230.25 --> 2233.24
enough and was good

2239.06 --> 2241.09
ah

2241.39 --> 2245.969
good to see yourself sup sylux Quinton

2248.73 --> 2255.57
yeah okay to anyone who has the link

2252.5 --> 2258.39
through my skype do not pass it on to

2255.57 --> 2261.29
anyone outside of those checked groups

2258.39 --> 2264.8689999999997
thank you very much we are considering

2261.29 --> 2269.04
it then please talk to me first

2264.869 --> 2270.78
because if yeah if it was okay to just

2269.04 --> 2275.839
hand it out to anyone I would just throw

2270.78 --> 2279.8590000000004
it out in chat right here and I don't so

2275.839 --> 2279.859
most of you probably know that

2284.03 --> 2289.78
I don't like to vote

2285.71 --> 2292.7
hello I don't like that kind of beer I

2289.78 --> 2294.59
guess it is for non-organic we are kind

2292.7 --> 2299.7799999999997
of okay but I don't like it I don't like

2294.59 --> 2304.79
that type I just drink basic basic

2299.78 --> 2306.53
organic beer and I like that that's good

2304.79 --> 2308.5099999999998
enough for me don't need anything

2306.53 --> 2311.3900000000003
special they'll need anything extra

2308.51 --> 2311.96
tastier the basic beer is good enough

2311.39 --> 2317.95
for me

2311.96 --> 2321.93
you know I don't need a lot of alcohol

2317.95 --> 2327.95
so it's good enough

2321.93 --> 2327.95
so yeah I I tend to get opener

2333.08 --> 2340.25
yeah this is the beer advertisements but

2338.0 --> 2344.99
yeah it's very basic beer it's like a

2340.25 --> 2350.0
euro each yes that could be considered

2344.99 --> 2352.49
extremely expensive compared to regular

2350.0 --> 2356.35

look even if he would I got I got OBS I

2478.11 --> 2483.33
got this under control so ok if there

2481.08 --> 2485.34
are some annoying trolls and I'm just

2483.33 --> 2488.7
gonna fade out the screen really quickly

2485.34 --> 2494.9300000000003
and eventually just kick the panel's

2488.7 --> 2494.93
start a new one I can do so

2499.309 --> 2502.599
all right I sent it

2511.339 --> 2518.91
lulz mercury messenger protects oh oh

2518.339 --> 2522.749
wait

2518.91 --> 2524.46
he actually said it right I thought she

2522.749 --> 2527.4889999999996
was gonna say he said like oh that I

2524.46 --> 2535.619
have to protect you right like you need

2527.489 --> 2540.14
the protection but yeah you actually

2535.619 --> 2542.789
said it right so it's kind of fun I

2540.14 --> 2545.73
don't need protection except for myself

2542.789 --> 2548.9700000000003
really when I feel like this and I just

2545.73 --> 2550.739
need some other people to talk yeah

2548.97 --> 2555.4399999999996
Arwen can take care of himself

2550.739 --> 2559.529
well when it comes to defense yeah I

2555.44 --> 2564.48
walk up to a certain point can only

2559.529 --> 2566.97
handle so much but yeah I do need a

2564.48 --> 2569.7
little bit of a defense from against

2566.97 --> 2572.1299999999997
myself because when I get in these moods

2569.7 --> 2574.3799999999997
you know I used to have them even when I

2572.13 --> 2576.539
was really young and there will be even

2574.38 --> 2580.289
be worse I was I would literally just go

2576.539 --> 2583.2000000000003
crying and screaming at the same time

2580.289 --> 2585.4500000000003
that bad yeah good you know you have

2583.2 --> 2587.46
that image in your head of are we crying

2585.45 --> 2589.6499999999996
and screaming at the same time good I

2587.46 --> 2594.45
hope I'll never actually do that on

2589.65 --> 2598.23
camera but the the remedy for that back

2594.45 --> 2600.779
then would be my family would be mostly

2598.23 --> 2603.299
my mother even my brother sometimes when

2600.779 --> 2605.13
he really got it they would come so me

2603.299 --> 2607.049
and they would just be nice and talk and

2605.13 --> 2610.71
say you know I know we are right and get

2607.049 --> 2614.309
through this and yeah technically I know

2610.71 --> 2616.079
all of these things but it doesn't help

2614.309 --> 2618.509
when you're in the state to have that

2616.079 --> 2620.4300000000003
knowledge it needs to be set by somebody

2618.509 --> 2625.589
else with another kind of energy and

2620.43 --> 2628.529
then it works yes that that's up that

2625.589 --> 2631.0389999999998
that emotional support is always very

2628.529 --> 2631.039
helpful

2631.58 --> 2646.02
so well Jess I hope he didn't pass out

2637.43 --> 2650.7

right no mm-hmm I is not and I thought

2894.33 --> 2900.2999999999997
you looked in Argentina I don't I live

2898.41 --> 2904.02
in the Netherlands I've been saying that

for three years don't know what you've

2904.02 --> 2913.77
been listening to but not to me so my

2911.13 --> 2917.79
subscribers can now be seen in the

2913.77 --> 2921.54
bottom corner of the screen okay Alan

Alan that's awesome so you were born and

2921.54 --> 2925.83

2925.83 --> 2932.84
no you wait oh I have a Dutch accent

2928.02 --> 2934.92
it's called Dutch Dutch nadir lumps

2932.84 --> 2939.59
Argentine have you been drinking

2934.92 --> 2944.28
not Norway Nord not the Norwegian okay

2939.59 --> 2946.23
Dutch we speak Dutch with the most hot

2944.28 --> 2949.98
and thick accent you can ever imagine

2946.23 --> 2952.26
okay that's Dutch and I try to get rid

2949.98 --> 2952.8
of that terrifying accent as much as

2952.26 --> 2958.4700000000003
possible

2952.8 --> 2960.6600000000003
oh okay to 944 subscribers you know I'm

2958.47 --> 2963.24
on the southern hemisphere but now I'm

2960.66 --> 2968.16
living in a Houston Texas

2963.24 --> 2971.04
and I've been here for a few months you

2968.16 --> 2975.0
know we got a gone so we can we can live

2971.04 --> 2978.65
Terry you know around the streets you

2975.0 --> 2978.65
know all that all day you know

2979.49 --> 2983.6099999999997
open-carry I don't care I've been here

2981.72 --> 2985.2999999999997
just a few months I'm just getting used

2983.61 --> 2989.86
to it I got the

2985.3 --> 2994.1800000000003
I don't care you know I'll carry those

2989.86 --> 2996.67
that the same sort of thing so aren't

2994.18 --> 2999.8799999999997
the same sort of thing as what now live

2996.67 --> 3001.77
Carrie cuz that's what you said

2999.88 --> 3003.69
originally I'm not familiar with that

3001.77 --> 3006.81
term here if you're if you carry a

3003.69 --> 3009.63
weapon carrouges you'd like out in the

3006.81 --> 3012.7999999999997
open that's open carry you seem like

3009.63 --> 3016.02
you're from the mid states Missouri Iowa

3012.8 --> 3024.6600000000003
Iowa you know

3016.02 --> 3028.19
no no if I dismiss it basically a finger

3024.66 --> 3030.75
you're from Canada and I'm from where

3028.19 --> 3035.4500000000003
did I just may simply offend you that

3030.75 --> 3035.45
and that you're actually from Canada I

3035.99 --> 3041.7299999999996
don't know what what place you're

3038.13 --> 3044.9100000000003
talking about nobody know I Canada no

3041.73 --> 3051.27
I'm definitely not from Canada and no I

3044.91 --> 3053.46
was not massively offended no yes this

3051.27 --> 3055.95
is really nice banter and everything but

3053.46 --> 3058.62
I thought you were gonna present some

3055.95 --> 3061.3799999999997
kind of globe proof that was the excuse

3058.62 --> 3063.93
for you to come on and yeah you have

3061.38 --> 3066.63
started by asking a question which was a

3063.93 --> 3071.49
wrong assumption so do you have anywhere

3066.63 --> 3075.3
to go from that well I would seem

3071.49 --> 3079.1699999999996
there's no proof either way that what

3075.3 --> 3083.25
the criteria are coming on is then my

3079.17 --> 3087.1800000000003
argument would be if the Flat Earth

3083.25 --> 3091.62
Methos is what you guys are saying

3087.18 --> 3093.96
that's what the method is right well

3091.62 --> 3095.18
yeah the map is a map it's a projection

3093.96 --> 3099.45
that's what it is

3095.18 --> 3103.58
mm-hmm but you but you but you know what

3099.45 --> 3105.6
a projection is right yeah I do okay

3103.58 --> 3106.98
jazz have you been drinking because you

3105.6 --> 3110.58
sound like you're a little slightly

3106.98 --> 3118.96
inebriated I you know I'm happy I have

3110.58 --> 3123.0789999999997
to know if the maps are projection

3118.96 --> 3126.2
let it shoot and longitude don't work on

3123.079 --> 3129.2000000000003
the platters napkin why not why not it's

3126.2 --> 3133.0699999999997
a projection no no no on the Flat Earth

3129.2 --> 3136.5789999999997
map the Flat Earth Map yeah yeah mm-hmm

3133.07 --> 3139.28
does does latitude and longitude work on

3136.579 --> 3142.9
the Flat Earth map well the funny thing

3139.28 --> 3147.02
is it's not a flat earth map it is a map

3142.9 --> 3148.579
it's the same map using an ejection so

3147.02 --> 3151.31
yeah it works on it because it is

3148.579 --> 3154.79
basically the same map using another

3151.31 --> 3160.13
projection yeah azimuth or equidistant

3154.79 --> 3164.71
projection yes okay so I'm a pilot and

3160.13 --> 3167.78
so if I wanted to fly to the south

3164.71 --> 3174.32
how the hell do I get to the South Pole

3167.78 --> 3176.27
and boy use the I II met the well it's

3174.32 --> 3178.31
very simple you go the other set of

3176.27 --> 3181.22
normal you know measure distances on the

3178.31 --> 3183.23
AE map and how do I get to the South

3181.22 --> 3186.2799999999997
Pole on the IE met because on Iran a

3183.23 --> 3190.369
normal map that I use on my flight cuts

3186.28 --> 3193.4
south points to South which is one point

3190.369 --> 3198.44
on the earth whether it's flat or a

3193.4 --> 3201.29
globe but on a flat earth mat south is

3198.44 --> 3203.839
360 degrees around the earth around the

3201.29 --> 3206.39
around the disc plane so if I want to go

3203.839 --> 3209.569
to south which chef do I know I'm going

3206.39 --> 3212.96
to be our location it is a projection

3209.569 --> 3215.3
it's not literally like that the South

3212.96 --> 3218.54
is circular South it's just the way it's

3215.3 --> 3220.94
been shown on the map what kind of a

3218.54 --> 3223.099
question it is this it's not our watch

3220.94 --> 3225.89
or how an hour it's how a natural the

3223.099 --> 3228.29
map is not literal Arwen so you're

3225.89 --> 3232.0
saying I could go to any point on that

3228.29 --> 3236.24
map and it would look exactly the same

3232.0 --> 3240.14
well define on that map you mean in the

3236.24 --> 3241.7
real world or on that map and in the

3240.14 --> 3244.43
real world because that's where we're

3241.7 --> 3246.859
living in the real world I could go any

3244.43 --> 3249.95
point on that map from any distance from

3246.859 --> 3251.84
any continent on the earth and it will

3249.95 --> 3256.6099999999997
look the same because that

3251.84 --> 3259.61
is the Ceph right is that what you're

3256.61 --> 3262.31
saying well yeah the world will look

3259.61 --> 3264.86
exactly as it does and the directions

3262.31 --> 3267.2
will be the directions as they are in

3264.86 --> 3268.88
the real world yeah describe the map

3267.2 --> 3273.6099999999997
here you I would Alan

3268.88 --> 3277.13
how do you know that have you been there

3273.61 --> 3279.1400000000003
that's part of your science well I've

3277.13 --> 3281.03
seen the globe of the heavens and their

3279.14 --> 3282.0499999999997
relation to the observer and the

3281.03 --> 3284.4700000000003
position on the earth

3282.05 --> 3287.0600000000004
and it seems to be pretty consistent and

3284.47 --> 3289.79
calculating when predictable so yeah

3287.06 --> 3291.41
trust that knowledge that relation

3289.79 --> 3295.18
between the globe of the heavens and we

3291.41 --> 3300.02
with where did you see the heavens from

3295.18 --> 3302.72
from my insights as everyone does did

3300.02 --> 3305.59
you see them from orbit like a friggin

3302.72 --> 3312.83
space shuttle but orbits the earth

3305.59 --> 3316.9100000000003
because it's a globe no no I didn't did

3312.83 --> 3321.5499999999997
you see them from I do I'm not saying my

3316.91 --> 3324.3199999999997
head all I'm asking you is you're saying

3321.55 --> 3327.2000000000003
that you've seen this and you can prove

3324.32 --> 3330.3500000000004
it you can't yeah you walk outside

3327.2 --> 3335.4199999999996
during the night and there's no clouds

3330.35 --> 3338.18
you can see the stars also the Sun then

3335.42 --> 3340.4900000000002
the moon always seems to be doing the

3338.18 --> 3343.16
same thing in the same orientation the

3340.49 --> 3346.91
same directional orientation in every

3343.16 --> 3348.35
location and that is the relation of the

3346.91 --> 3351.0499999999997
globe of the heavens with the earth

3348.35 --> 3351.67
that's that relation what the only what

3351.05 --> 3354.29
is do

3351.67 --> 3357.83
Arwen what happened seemed to the grey

3354.29 --> 3359.39
aliens come down and go up get a r1 will

3357.83 --> 3364.67
pick you up and we'll take you for a

3359.39 --> 3367.0699999999997
spin around the Sun and bless flash yeah

3364.67 --> 3370.61
I've responded I'd say sorry I have

3367.07 --> 3373.07
better things to waste my imagination on

3370.61 --> 3376.7000000000003
than on some kind of drugs fantasy thank

3373.07 --> 3380.75
you yeah you guys sorry boys I'm on

3376.7 --> 3382.41
YouTube talking about Flat Earth well

3380.75 --> 3387.23
yeah at least

3382.41 --> 3390.839
that's something that's not an obvious

3387.23 --> 3393.51
delusion where's your proof jazz Conda

3390.839 --> 3395.49
where's your evidence what were you

3393.51 --> 3397.44
going what did what was it that you said

3395.49 --> 3399.839
that you had to say that you said that I

3397.44 --> 3401.67
didn't want to hear that I let you come

3399.839 --> 3403.91
on this hangout I invited you so that

3401.67 --> 3408.089
you could say it but you're not a saint

3403.91 --> 3410.6299999999997
and and Karen Bay I'm very sorry for not

3408.089 --> 3415.77
getting onto that I'm very sorry

3410.63 --> 3418.6400000000003
honored that you let me on a muppet of

3415.77 --> 3422.64
his letter cheater longitude

3418.64 --> 3425.67
it doesn't if you can prove it works on

3422.64 --> 3431.91
a flat earth mat then you've got

3425.67 --> 3434.7000000000003
something did did you forget the first

3431.91 --> 3438.839
part of our conversation jazz where I

3434.7 --> 3441.66
told you there is no flat earth map it's

3438.839 --> 3446.339
a projection it has no relation to the

3441.66 --> 3449.069
earth the earth is retention right

3446.339 --> 3450.299
exactly how the surfaces are

3449.069 --> 3455.0099999999998
interconnected

3450.299 --> 3457.68
there is no scale in the projection in

3455.01 --> 3461.849
any projection oh when you just made a

3457.68 --> 3465.27
huge error oh I did really what is my

3461.849 --> 3469.98
error you know yeah how do we get around

3465.27 --> 3472.109
a city that we don't know if you drive

3469.98 --> 3478.289
into a city that you don't know what do

3472.109 --> 3485.73
you get to find you I ran a city well

3478.289 --> 3490.8590000000004
you get which is cold

3485.73 --> 3494.369
I wrote that or in other words just

3490.859 --> 3495.9
quite simply a Mike alpha poplar and if

3494.369 --> 3505.65
we say that without the phonetic

3495.9 --> 3508.529
alphabet that's colder yeah so you just

3505.65 --> 3510.69
said that we've been searching the

3508.529 --> 3512.119
universes for all these years and we

3510.69 --> 3516.9790000000003
can't

3512.119 --> 3518.9
figure out what the frigg's got on or we

3516.979 --> 3522.2889999999998
can they're just not being allowed to

3518.9 --> 3530.109
basically or at least to let that actual

3522.289 --> 3530.1090000000004
those realizations sing dude

3530.17 --> 3536.449
did you just say that so where was my

3534.799 --> 3538.249
mistake jazakallah because you're

3536.449 --> 3541.579
basically red-herring me so what a

3538.249 --> 3544.4489999999996
mistake did I make in saying that a map

3541.579 --> 3549.619
does not prove the shape of anything

3544.449 --> 3552.619
it's only a projection something that

3549.619 --> 3555.6800000000003
shows you the relation of the surfaces

3552.619 --> 3559.1890000000003
in relation to each other through the

3555.68 --> 3563.509
means of projection so it's a lot to

3559.189 --> 3565.699
scale nothing of it is to scale even on

3563.509 --> 3569.079
the globe map when it's actually

3565.699 --> 3570.289
projected like a globe it's not at scale

3569.079 --> 3572.15
exactly

3570.289 --> 3575.509
and you just prove that you don't

3572.15 --> 3580.429
understand what a projection is oh my

3575.509 --> 3585.079
god want to be kicked right now where is

3580.429 --> 3588.549
your evidence kit please can you get to

3585.079 --> 3588.549
that pretty please

3589.719 --> 3595.13
I'm getting to the same point Karen

3593.029 --> 3598.609
because Alban hasn't got any and he

3595.13 --> 3600.279
hasn't for six months so that's the way

3598.609 --> 3603.109
you guys want to work then that's cool

3600.279 --> 3605.929
okay well you came on here saying that

3603.109 --> 3608.8089999999997
you had evidence of a globe proof of a

3605.929 --> 3611.779
globe whatever you want to call it and I

3608.809 --> 3613.9100000000003
do right now I do right now and it's

3611.779 --> 3615.619
words exactly the same as what's

3613.91 --> 3618.249
happening right now so if you want to

3615.619 --> 3621.529
kick me that's fine that's fine Karen

3618.249 --> 3624.14
well it's really annoying when you get

3621.529 --> 3626.749
here and then start to accuse me of

3624.14 --> 3629.1189999999997
things that I obviously don't say and

3626.749 --> 3632.2389999999996
then claim I don't have understanding of

3629.119 --> 3634.1890000000003
something that I obviously do and you

3632.239 --> 3637.549
won't because you're still referring to

3634.189 --> 3640.1499999999996
a Flat Earth myth like it's some literal

3637.549 --> 3644.259
representation like a complete [ __ ]

3640.15 --> 3645.86
okay I would stop wasting my time

3644.259 --> 3650.53
Arwen's

3645.86 --> 3655.2200000000003
stop being a and stop backing down I

3650.53 --> 3657.4100000000003
haven't in case you forgot it's not

3655.22 --> 3660.2599999999998
backing down listen you said I don't

3657.41 --> 3662.45
want to hear your proof and so I invited

3660.26 --> 3667.1000000000004
you on here to hear it and I do want to

3662.45 --> 3670.5499999999997
hear it so they share I wouldn't just

3667.1 --> 3672.2
see that I was telling him that always

3670.55 --> 3673.6000000000004
telling him to back down or whatever I

3672.2 --> 3677.0
don't really care

3673.6 --> 3679.1
well i stoled you to stop accusing me of

3677.0 --> 3681.38
something that is obviously not true

3679.1 --> 3684.35
because I just explained what

3681.38 --> 3687.05
projections are and how they work and

3684.35 --> 3688.7799999999997
then you just out of nothing claim that

3687.05 --> 3691.01
I don't understand it

3688.78 --> 3692.51
you're the one that doesn't understand

3691.01 --> 3694.8500000000004
it which you cuz because you bring up

3692.51 --> 3698.0
the same stupid arguments every time

3694.85 --> 3699.92
these false dichotomies you fled map

3698.0 --> 3703.22
there is no flat earth map it's a

3699.92 --> 3707.15
projection doesn't anything about the

3703.22 --> 3710.66
shape it's directly yeah exactly so what

3707.15 --> 3713.09
is your point there you you just proved

3710.66 --> 3715.8199999999997
everything right in and what you just

3713.09 --> 3721.6400000000003
see it and that very sentence but I will

3715.82 --> 3723.77
just how how you just did how explain it

3721.64 --> 3724.72
to me you're owning it don't explain it

3723.77 --> 3729.59
to me

3724.72 --> 3731.39
Arwen what's a prediction Jaz we already

3729.59 --> 3733.61
went through this please show us your

3731.39 --> 3738.64
evidence please I want to hear it I want

3733.61 --> 3742.1200000000003
to see it right now um I don't have

3738.64 --> 3746.81
anything to show you because reality is

3742.12 --> 3749.93
there okay so you don't have any proof

3746.81 --> 3752.33
is that what you're saying so what

3749.93 --> 3755.2999999999997
you're saying Karen and and and that's

3752.33 --> 3760.4
understandable as what every letter is

3755.3 --> 3762.7400000000002
saying you need to be able to see you

3760.4 --> 3765.08
need to be able to go to the moon you

3762.74 --> 3767.4199999999996
need to be able to go to Mars to the

3765.08 --> 3769.0699999999997
insight Lander and be on Mars when it

3767.42 --> 3771.41
lands there well I mean they've been

3769.07 --> 3773.1200000000003
telling us they're gonna give us space

3771.41 --> 3777.8799999999997
tourism for like 20 years now and it's

3773.12 --> 3779.71
still not happening so but Karen see

3777.88 --> 3783.9500000000003
because you brought that

3779.71 --> 3787.9990000000003
what is what's just one reason why you

3783.95 --> 3791.509
think that wouldn't happen straight away

3787.999 --> 3794.799
as they said because we can't go so

3791.509 --> 3798.92
where is your evidence just a condo oh

3794.799 --> 3801.529
no no no Karen no no you said you had

3798.92 --> 3804.2000000000003
evidence you came on here because you

3801.529 --> 3809.289
said you had evidence and I want to see

3804.2 --> 3814.009
it and that's exactly what I said you

3809.289 --> 3817.94
you PU you lovely no did you agree

3814.009 --> 3825.229
actually lovely people you lovely lovely

3817.94 --> 3829.239
people want to have you you need to be

3825.229 --> 3829.239
there in order to believe

3835.3 --> 3843.19
no not right see all I came okay it's

3841.15 --> 3846.46
not about being there it's about the

3843.19 --> 3850.06
actual journey from here to there look

3846.46 --> 3854.01
you can have a there anywhere you like

3850.06 --> 3856.66
underground some area that's off-limits

3854.01 --> 3859.2400000000002
do whatever you want to do have some

3856.66 --> 3862.6
nice camera filters adding some nice

3859.24 --> 3865.2999999999997
globe and a half of the heaven CGI and

3862.6 --> 3867.94
afterwards if you like and say this is

3865.3 --> 3870.46
Mars it's not about the freaking shut up

3867.94 --> 3873.79
for a second it's not about the location

3870.46 --> 3877.36
it's about going from here to there in

3873.79 --> 3880.45
one shot that's what it's about

3877.36 --> 3883.69
not about this occasion no it's about

3880.45 --> 3889.9199999999996
that it's actually there as I said that

3883.69 --> 3894.12
is what it's about and Arwen that's code

3889.92 --> 3897.78
paranoia no it's called missing evidence

3894.12 --> 3901.15
evidence that does not exist there is no

3897.78 --> 3903.76
non-stop shot from the earth to whatever

3901.15 --> 3907.39
space location out there there is none

3903.76 --> 3910.09
there is none none on record zero

3907.39 --> 3911.5299999999997
exactly to those things and they can do

3910.09 --> 3913.9300000000003
it cameras are everywhere they have

3911.53 --> 3917.1400000000003
cameras all over their freakin rocket on

3913.93 --> 3919.93
several locations and they never have a

3917.14 --> 3923.98
singular shots they never do it they

3919.93 --> 3928.18
never show it ever I won I won just

3923.98 --> 3929.71
kinda jawan hang on Karen I just want to

3928.18 --> 3933.46
say one thing how when you sending

3929.71 --> 3936.25
really angry you're sending really angry

3933.46 --> 3939.16
so you just shut up Arwen I wouldn't

3936.25 --> 3942.19
shut the [ __ ] up okay okay piss him off

3939.16 --> 3943.2999999999997
peace everybody oh my gosh everybody

3942.19 --> 3947.28
calm down calm down

3943.3 --> 3947.28
Jeff Conda no he's not there anymore

3951.68 --> 3960.8999999999996
nobody talks to me like that on my

3954.24 --> 3964.58
freakin hangout okay as usual jazz

3960.9 --> 3971.58
akanda doesn't have anything nothing

3964.58 --> 3973.65
there was nothing obvious your I knew it

3971.58 --> 3976.29
from the second he literally opened his

3973.65 --> 3977.82
mouth and asked a question you're on the

3976.29 --> 3981.0
southern hemisphere right

3977.82 --> 3985.76
and instantly wrong the first thing he

3981.0 --> 3989.04
said well and then he says that he's in

3985.76 --> 3992.9700000000003
that he's in Texas you know in Texas

3989.04 --> 3994.83
right now it's 7:00 a.m. so if he really

3992.97 --> 3999.18
is in Texas at 7:00 a.m. and he is like

3994.83 --> 4001.46
shit-faced drunk I think

3999.18 --> 4002.8399999999997
jazakallah is not in Texas really I

4001.46 --> 4007.9900000000002
thought he was an Australian or

4002.84 --> 4015.53
something yeah I think he's full of crap

4007.99 --> 4018.3799999999997
yep probably some as well or maybe the

4015.53 --> 4019.7000000000003
remnants of doesn't I don't know maybe

4018.38 --> 4021.86
he doesn't even drink alcohol anymore

4019.7 --> 4024.64
and this is just what's left of him from

4021.86 --> 4024.6400000000003
all his drinking

4027.81 --> 4044.14
anyway my subscriber count' seems to be

4030.37 --> 4049.7799999999997
stuck on the 942 still okay so you want

4044.14 --> 4054.0699999999997
to let somebody else or maybe well I

4049.78 --> 4066.2400000000002
don't know are there any more drunk glow

4054.07 --> 4066.2400000000002
bees who say they have globe proof maybe

4066.51 --> 4073.69
yeah I I don't know a lot of these

4070.36 --> 4078.09
people in here not really but maybe if

4073.69 --> 4078.09
you know somebody they got somebody

4081.349 --> 4087.9300000000003
on the other hand we've been going for

4084.0 --> 4090.2
over an hour already so yeah time did

4087.93 --> 4090.2
fly

4094.3 --> 4101.529
so yeah Karen what have you been up to

4097.63 --> 4105.37
recently any developments with Effie

4101.529 --> 4109.859
poor or oh yeah we're very busy doing

4105.37 --> 4109.8589999999995
stuff right now we have a lot going on I

4110.19 --> 4125.049
know that we'll be doing a stream for

4115.839 --> 4128.109
our members on the 20th we're producing

4125.049 --> 4130.68
our laser video of a document of all the

4128.109 --> 4133.150000000001
laser measurements that we've done and

4130.68 --> 4135.79
some other projects and the work we have

4133.15 --> 4137.259999999999
force we have that other land

4135.79 --> 4140.29
measurement that we're working on the

4137.26 --> 4143.319
force the level that we're gonna be

4140.29 --> 4153.7789999999995
doing in Colorado so yeah we got some

4143.319 --> 4156.43
stuff going on cool still working that

4153.779 --> 4161.529
you guys are talking about besides your

4156.43 --> 4162.76
own experiments and everything I'm gonna

4161.529 --> 4165.67
mean like as far as like what other

4162.76 --> 4167.9800000000005
people are doing or I don't know I don't

4165.67 --> 4170.68
know how much you guys are focusing

4167.98 --> 4172.69
purely on the tasks at hand or that you

4170.68 --> 4177.88
also have a wider look on the world or

4172.69 --> 4180.16
maybe like well we do that business like

4177.88 --> 4182.29
what other governments are potentially

4180.16 --> 4186.339
doing with Flat Earth or anything in

4182.29 --> 4190.21
that direction or not so much I don't

4186.339 --> 4191.98
know I don't know about what other

4190.21 --> 4193.45
governments are doing but yeah mostly

4191.98 --> 4194.889999999999
we're just focusing on the stuff that

4193.45 --> 4197.08
we're trying to do things that we're

4194.89 --> 4201.93
trying to get done as far as like

4197.08 --> 4201.93
presenting information to the public so

4205.409 --> 4210.929
yeah by the way do you like do you ever

4208.26 --> 4213.929
like me to get permission to do certain

4210.929 --> 4215.55
things for tests or anything oh yeah

4213.929 --> 4217.56
especially when you're using those big

4215.55 --> 4220.860000000001
lasers you have to get permits and all

4217.56 --> 4224.76
that stuff yeah and are there any

4220.86 --> 4227.04
obstacles like once they find out it is

4224.76 --> 4228.360000000001
like for Flat Earth experiments is there

4227.04 --> 4230.25
any time that they're people just

4228.36 --> 4233.849999999999
getting in the way you're not helping or

4230.25 --> 4235.679
does that ever happen or well yeah when

4233.85 --> 4238.650000000001
we were in Hungary they they called the

4235.679 --> 4240.42
police on us yeah and the police showed

4238.65 --> 4242.759999999999
up to Lake Balaton but we had all the

4240.42 --> 4244.5
permits and we had the laser astaire and

4242.76 --> 4247.59
like we had everything in line that we

4244.5 --> 4250.5
had to have so they just left and we

4247.59 --> 4252.860000000001
went about our business but yeah it

4250.5 --> 4252.86
happens

4254.12 --> 4259.05
well no although laser experiments have

4258.27 --> 4260.55
been done

4259.05 --> 4261.84
we're not experiments but the laser

4260.55 --> 4263.76
measurements have been done over in

4261.84 --> 4266.0
Europe so far we haven't done any over

4263.76 --> 4266.0
here

4271.409 --> 4275.61
okay so at least in the United States

4274.11 --> 4277.32
they're just leaving you alone

4275.61 --> 4280.86
but there's other governments out there

4277.32 --> 4283.83
that are really anxious about the whole

4280.86 --> 4285.36
Flat Earth ordeal apparently well I

4283.83 --> 4286.86
don't know that it was the government's

4285.36 --> 4294.92
that called the police on us I think it

4286.86 --> 4294.92
was just some Hungarian trolls yeah okay

4296.75 --> 4309.449
there's trolls in every country yeah the

4303.929 --> 4313.82
latest cultural developments hey I see

4309.449 --> 4313.82
consequence turn Society has evolved

4317.88 --> 4324.36
but it was bound to happen that a lot of

4320.22 --> 4326.25
trolls were there are there and one

4324.36 --> 4328.32
could consider that because trolls are

4326.25 --> 4334.62
now making everyone miserable online

4328.32 --> 4336.8099999999995
that in the real world it's lessened so

4334.62 --> 4339.66
yeah but they're still try to do stuff I

4336.81 --> 4341.01
mean you guys saw speakers corner in I

4339.66 --> 4342.75
don't know where they were in London

4341.01 --> 4348.93
where Riley was there and cat earth

4342.75 --> 4351.2
showed up I mean you know right yeah but

4348.93 --> 4351.200000000001
it's

4353.94 --> 4357.98
we cat Aerith right it's another guy

4358.43 --> 4361.780000000001
I have never seen him

4363.06 --> 4367.67
so many flat earthers out there it's

4365.01 --> 4370.62
just hard to keep a track of all that

4367.67 --> 4373.95
flat earthers and ballers at the same

4370.62 --> 4377.04
time sometimes I just mistake them like

4373.95 --> 4378.66
they're in cheddar like I and just not

4377.04 --> 4383.43
even sure like Oh were they flat

4378.66 --> 4390.51
earthers or ballers or whatever doesn't

4383.43 --> 4394.05
matter anyway so yeah I think I'm gonna

4390.51 --> 4398.43
round out the show now since nobody else

4394.05 --> 4401.7300000000005
