114.36 --> 122.24
all it's all cool support and support

117.54 --> 122.24000000000001
right the weather today is really nice

124.14 --> 128.94
it's gonna win still kind of pretty

127.38 --> 132.7
sunny

128.94 --> 135.94
still plenty of clouds around but

132.7 --> 135.94
[Music]

136.62 --> 140.70000000000002
yeah from this rapid Point there's a lot

138.66 --> 144.62
of Sun hitting so

140.7 --> 144.61999999999998
excuse me it's really nice

146.7 --> 153.959
temperature probably registers same like

150.72 --> 156.48
22 degrees or something maybe warmer but

153.959 --> 159.599
probably like that it's just right here

156.48 --> 163.04
right now there's a lot of some

159.599 --> 163.04
so it feels warmer

166.26 --> 168.62
you

169.56 --> 173.94
anyway hello Moxie first in chat Richard

172.68 --> 176.84
G

173.94 --> 176.84
good to see you

177.3 --> 183.3
it is Thursday the 20th of July 2023

186.66 --> 191.82
foreign

188.79 --> 191.82
[Music]

194.519 --> 197.0
so

197.28 --> 202.739
I'm starting to get

199.379 --> 205.85999999999999
an edge on how my predictions are wrong

202.739 --> 207.36
like my own into intuitive it's funny

205.86 --> 209.15900000000002
it's like

207.36 --> 211.20000000000002
I've been doing this for so long like

209.159 --> 214.319
I'm starting to like

211.2 --> 216.54
figure out sub patterns

214.319 --> 218.76
of like of my own guessing

216.54 --> 220.67999999999998
it's really funny because it's you like

218.76 --> 222.0
have the weather then you have me sizing

220.68 --> 225.18
it up

222.0 --> 229.799
and then you have the typical result and

225.18 --> 232.5
all of these things are all data and I

229.799 --> 234.78
definitely do keep track of the result

232.5 --> 236.819
and like if I'm off

234.78 --> 238.26
so in this case I was like yeah it feels

236.819 --> 240.72
really warm it's probably like 25

238.26 --> 243.42
degrees then I thought like wait a lot

240.72 --> 246.0
of the times when I thought that it was

243.42 --> 250.14
actually not as warm

246.0 --> 252.06
it's just here so then I thought 22 is

250.14 --> 254.42
so I got it right this time thanks to

252.06 --> 254.42000000000002
the

254.519 --> 262.22
the result data analysis my previous

258.26 --> 262.21999999999997
attempts to guess the temperature

262.919 --> 266.479
anyway how are you guys doing

271.56 --> 278.11
I'm doing pretty good but I I am finding

274.8 --> 280.38
myself a bit knackered or tired up

278.11 --> 283.68
[Music]

280.38 --> 287.0
so much flatter debates recently like

283.68 --> 287.0
just keeps going and going

288.2 --> 291.269
[Music]

291.78 --> 296.4
feel like I need a bit of a break or

293.82 --> 299.4
something I don't know what it is

296.4 --> 299.4
buggy

299.58 --> 305.35999999999996
yeah and I keep having issues with my

302.04 --> 305.36
shoulder it's really annoying

307.02 --> 314.18
yesterday it kind of started playing

309.66 --> 314.18
back up and today again it's just

315.54 --> 321.02000000000004
almost

316.919 --> 321.02
making it harder they sleep even

321.12 --> 324.199
so I don't know

331.02 --> 334.69899999999996
I do all kinds of like

334.82 --> 340.5
stretching and maneuvering and I mean my

338.22 --> 343.44000000000005
left shoulder is now relatively

340.5 --> 345.6
incredibly flexible just because of all

343.44 --> 348.3
this

345.6 --> 350.40000000000003
this the stuff that I do with it

348.3 --> 353.039
continually to keep it Loose it is

350.4 --> 356.75899999999996
actually loose it's not

353.039 --> 358.68
it being stiff that is like do a problem

356.759 --> 360.84000000000003
it's just

358.68 --> 364.199
it feels like something is in the way or

360.84 --> 366.5
something but it's not like a red is

364.199 --> 366.5
wrong

369.12 --> 374.54
because that feels very different anyway

371.34 --> 376.02
I don't know what it is it's annoying

374.54 --> 380.03900000000004
[Music]

376.02 --> 382.56
ah all right I got some not rockola but

380.039 --> 385.58
these little gem leaves

382.56 --> 385.58
two of them actually

385.919 --> 391.68
so I'm gonna eat that

388.8 --> 393.6
because yeah it feels great too and it's

391.68 --> 396.3
very juicy these

393.6 --> 399.84000000000003
with this heat that's kind of nice Hey

396.3 --> 402.62
Kevin K iron 26.

399.84 --> 402.61999999999995
cheers

408.66 --> 412.34000000000003
[Music]

410.16 --> 412.34000000000003
foreign

412.68 --> 415.68
house

426.479 --> 430.38
did anybody follow Dell's hangout from

428.94 --> 433.199
yesterday

430.38 --> 435.24
I took note it was there

433.199 --> 440.41900000000004
made a little troll coming at the start

435.24 --> 440.419
but I didn't really watch it

448.259 --> 453.5
you made a video on it

450.72 --> 453.5
oh really

457.139 --> 459.979
on your Channel

460.139 --> 463.94
okay you can post the link if you want

469.08 --> 474.18
Flat Earth rising oh three hours ago

472.919 --> 476.21999999999997
hmm

474.18 --> 478.5
it's 40

476.22 --> 481.58000000000004
45 seconds

478.5 --> 481.58
alrighty then

486.479 --> 489.02
foreign

495.38 --> 499.4
yeah that one yes

499.74 --> 506.539
I related in Skype and like QE went

503.58 --> 506.539
ballistic on it

506.699 --> 510.86
made an entire court case out of it

515.279 --> 520.88
to me at this point it's just kind of

516.959 --> 520.88
funny that they'll just keeps trying

531.54 --> 535.62
but I mean I can only give so many

534.06 --> 537.7399999999999
warnings

535.62 --> 540.66
as in

537.74 --> 542.54
precautionary warnings and Devil's not

540.66 --> 547.16
listening at all

542.54 --> 547.16
like really not listening so

547.26 --> 550.5
I'm

548.58 --> 554.48
I'm a little tired of this in of the

550.5 --> 554.48
situation really already

555.48 --> 558.48
foreign

560.36 --> 563.66
good to see you

582.2 --> 585.349
[Music]

587.94 --> 591.5600000000001
who's claim what

592.26 --> 595.64
oh the

595.92 --> 600.5
fed claim according to Dell

603.12 --> 609.0
it just if you saw that

606.18 --> 610.7399999999999
super long after show where Nathan was

609.0 --> 612.12
grilling him

610.74 --> 615.36
Dell

612.12 --> 617.279
beyond the imaginary curve uh I don't

615.36 --> 619.86
know it's a members only stream I don't

617.279 --> 624.0
know if it's come out yet as a regular

619.86 --> 627.2
premiere probably not it just happened

624.0 --> 627.2
like two days ago

627.48 --> 630.5
but uh

632.279 --> 635.58
yeah

634.26 --> 639.48
I mean

635.58 --> 641.76
Dell was trying to basically get Nathan

639.48 --> 644.64
he was attempting to get Nathan to make

641.76 --> 646.92
a claim from a flatter side like about

644.64 --> 648.779
relative density or the motion of Earth

646.92 --> 653.16
anything

648.779 --> 654.3
because yeah like he knows how the game

653.16 --> 656.64
works

654.3 --> 658.9399999999999
but he's acting like an anti-flat

656.64 --> 658.9399999999999
earther

659.22 --> 662.61
so he's just trying to get us on a claim

661.98 --> 664.2
and then

662.61 --> 666.9590000000001
[Music]

664.2 --> 670.82
really [ __ ] stupid

666.959 --> 670.8199999999999
and so now he thinks that

671.399 --> 677.82
like oh we don't

674.94 --> 680.36
we're gonna hammerdale on his claim of

677.82 --> 683.82
the Earth moving upward no he's

680.36 --> 686.5790000000001
hammering us because we claim according

683.82 --> 688.86
to him that the Earth is stationary and

686.579 --> 691.4399999999999
that's an extraordinary claim he even

688.86 --> 696.14
said so

691.44 --> 696.1400000000001
it's it's getting kind of tired so

697.8 --> 703.579
I'm sure we'll be hearing some about it

700.38 --> 703.579
on fpd

709.83 --> 713.039
[Music]

734.16 --> 739.16
you didn't hear him say

736.44 --> 739.1600000000001
what do you mean

739.8 --> 743.54
in what iron 26

750.6 --> 755.94
you mean during the uh

753.48 --> 757.5600000000001
FD

755.94 --> 759.6
where Dell got on

757.56 --> 762.1199999999999
yeah he didn't say that

759.6 --> 765.86
he didn't actually say that Nathan

762.12 --> 769.079
basically reminded him about it and then

765.86 --> 772.74
addressed that but he himself did never

769.079 --> 776.959
set it because he on purpose avoided it

772.74 --> 776.9590000000001
because he was being a sneaky bastard

777.839 --> 785.24
like ruhiff like what he was doing was

782.279 --> 789.42
what ruhf would do

785.24 --> 793.38
really really sneaky

789.42 --> 797.2199999999999
just taking the battering in favor of

793.38 --> 802.5
not making the claim so that he couldn't

797.22 --> 802.5
be cut cut off it's it's tactics

804.3 --> 809.3599999999999
at ulterior motives well

807.24 --> 812.5790000000001
ulterium

809.36 --> 814.98
it's not necessarily like oh it has

812.579 --> 817.6389999999999
secretly an agenda it just it's making

814.98 --> 817.639
it personal

818.04 --> 822.36
like where it it doesn't because it's

820.86 --> 825.9590000000001
not about the argument anymore it's

822.36 --> 829.26
about putting fed in its place

825.959 --> 830.9399999999999
if the if that's the alternative mode

829.26 --> 833.639
ulterior motive that you had in mind

830.94 --> 835.5
then yes correct

833.639 --> 838.5790000000001
it's just personal it just wants to

835.5 --> 838.579
destroy fed now

839.339 --> 844.019
one's Revenge

842.22 --> 847.28
for his treatment

844.019 --> 850.4
just like anti-filaterals

847.28 --> 850.4
[Music]

855.24 --> 860.04
he was embarrassed to say it outside of

857.1 --> 863.66
his bubble yes because on fed you get

860.04 --> 863.66
healthy task you

864.24 --> 868.62
if you make a claim you have to actually

866.22 --> 870.3000000000001
provide the proof unlike on his own show

868.62 --> 871.26
where you can basically say whatever he

870.3 --> 875.579
wants

871.26 --> 880.279
and people will just say yay in the chat

875.579 --> 880.279
because they say yay to whatever he says

884.94 --> 891.3800000000001
especially the trolls

887.94 --> 891.3800000000001
who love hang around there

897.54 --> 903.899
I mean just

899.639 --> 906.12
have Dell say my name audibly like that

903.899 --> 907.62
you could actually be sure that he says

906.12 --> 910.579
my name just once

907.62 --> 913.8
and you'll have like three four trolls

910.579 --> 917.12
say my name 20 times within two minutes

913.8 --> 917.12
in the chat there

918.779 --> 922.399
it's full of trolls

931.399 --> 936.92
all right so yeah that was just being a

934.079 --> 936.92
sneaky bastard

938.699 --> 942.26
not being honest about

943.019 --> 945.92
what he's doing

946.68 --> 953.899
about his idea his conception that

949.62 --> 953.899
technically can be proven

954.72 --> 960.899
and if you assume that it is the cause

958.199 --> 963.8
of all these things that are what we

960.899 --> 963.8
normally perceive

964.199 --> 969.06
then you're committing to a

965.82 --> 972.24
pharmacological fallacy where you

969.06 --> 974.76
assume the outcome is the cause of

972.24 --> 977.699
things the way they are

974.76 --> 982.22
without actually being able to

977.699 --> 982.2199999999999
deliver proof that there is a thing

983.76 --> 988.199
and with upward moving earth that is

985.74 --> 990.779
absolutely the case because there is no

988.199 --> 992.2199999999999
way there is literally nothing you can

990.779 --> 996.68
do

992.22 --> 996.6800000000001
to prove that that is happening

998.399 --> 1003.86
without like leaving the realm

1001.519 --> 1005.12
attaching reference frames

1003.86 --> 1007.04
because anything you're going to do

1005.12 --> 1009.62
within the realm it's all going to lead

1007.04 --> 1012.62
to just you presupposing that the Earth

1009.62 --> 1014.6
is moving up causing the things

1012.62 --> 1019.279
like the density axis in its

1014.6 --> 1021.38
manifestation it's just an idea

1019.279 --> 1025.54
that you can never prove and I try to

1021.38 --> 1025.54
warn him about this like a month ago

1025.579 --> 1031.459
like put it in the title and everything

1029.02 --> 1033.559
you can't prove upward accelerating

1031.459 --> 1035.54
Earth

1033.559 --> 1039.52
it's just not listening he doesn't care

1035.54 --> 1039.52
he's just attacking attacking

1046.4 --> 1052.0400000000002
it can be proved not to now that's

1048.58 --> 1054.3799999999999
illogical you can't prove something not

1052.04 --> 1057.44
happening

1054.38 --> 1061.0
like proving non-existence that's not

1057.44 --> 1061.0
you can prove something happening

1061.22 --> 1064.66
or you can prove something

1066.5 --> 1073.179
not happening or rather disproving

1070.34 --> 1073.1789999999999
something is happening

1074.36 --> 1079.58
so yeah okay in that sense

1077.24 --> 1082.64
can disprove it

1079.58 --> 1085.4189999999999
which you can't prove a a numb

1082.64 --> 1085.419
a knot

1086.419 --> 1089.44
it's a force

1092.299 --> 1096.76
to claims is magical yeah Magic

1105.14 --> 1109.5800000000002
right he says you need a force or there

1107.9 --> 1114.26
can't be any

1109.58 --> 1116.539
density dense disequilibrium forces

1114.26 --> 1118.34
well that's just the baseless assertions

1116.539 --> 1120.62
like oh if we didn't have this we

1118.34 --> 1122.84
wouldn't have that well you can't test

1120.62 --> 1126.1999999999998
that now can you

1122.84 --> 1128.299
right because you'd have to detach from

1126.2 --> 1131.48
this realm in order for those mechanics

1128.299 --> 1134.539
to stop working if that's even possible

1131.48 --> 1135.679
both those steps detaching and that it

1134.539 --> 1137.72
would stop

1135.679 --> 1139.5800000000002
and then you could like say like wow

1137.72 --> 1142.1000000000001
it's only in the realm

1139.58 --> 1143.36
that the density axis functions the way

1142.1 --> 1145.4599999999998
it does

1143.36 --> 1147.86
when outside of it it doesn't do that

1145.46 --> 1148.9
it's just free-floating well then you

1147.86 --> 1152.4189999999999
have a case

1148.9 --> 1156.039
you know so good freaking luck with that

1152.419 --> 1156.039
because you're never going to prove that

1156.919 --> 1160.2800000000002
it's just very simple that's never going

1158.78 --> 1163.0
to be proven

1160.28 --> 1163.0
just no

1163.64 --> 1168.4
that will only work in a science fiction

1165.98 --> 1168.4
movie

1179.419 --> 1184.9
says he doesn't need a force but I

1182.24 --> 1184.9
approved he did

1188.12 --> 1192.799
well yeah

1190.22 --> 1197.0
I mean the density axis

1192.799 --> 1199.16
is enhanced and altered by forces

1197.0 --> 1201.98
so if you're going to claim that the

1199.16 --> 1204.679
density axis in its passive state is

1201.98 --> 1207.5
there because of something

1204.679 --> 1209.48
then that's something logically should

1207.5 --> 1213.039
be a force

1209.48 --> 1213.039
if you're going to claim that

1214.52 --> 1221.0
you can't say oh something that isn't a

1217.22 --> 1224.799
force is causing the density gradient

1221.0 --> 1227.78
to be other yeah non-free-floating

1224.799 --> 1230.179
that's illogical that's just

1227.78 --> 1232.8999999999999
mechanically illogical

1230.179 --> 1232.9
to claim that

1233.0 --> 1237.62
you're gonna claim there's a cause for

1235.46 --> 1241.66
the density axis

1237.62 --> 1241.6599999999999
it will be Force related

1242.419 --> 1246.6200000000001
right that's the whole point of X of

1244.64 --> 1248.539
accelerating it's not moving upwards

1246.62 --> 1250.76
really stupid that he kept saying that

1248.539 --> 1252.86
accelerating upward Earth

1250.76 --> 1255.86
would be

1252.86 --> 1257.4799999999998
well introducing that force of the

1255.86 --> 1259.6399999999999
acceleration

1257.48 --> 1262.039
that causes the density gradient that

1259.64 --> 1265.1200000000001
would be the reasoning so it's the force

1262.039 --> 1265.12
of it that would do it

1268.64 --> 1275.1200000000001
so it's just getting super convoluted

1271.7 --> 1278.24
and diluted he made a case then he won't

1275.12 --> 1281.36
really back his conceptual case

1278.24 --> 1282.5
and would rather like avoid in the

1281.36 --> 1286.28
moment

1282.5 --> 1288.14
getting conf getting stuck on on an

1286.28 --> 1290.059
argument that is part of his claim so

1288.14 --> 1293.419
he's literally weaseling his way around

1290.059 --> 1295.94
and thereby completely

1293.419 --> 1299.419
like he made this painting and now he's

1295.94 --> 1302.2
basically just like turning into a brown

1299.419 --> 1302.2
piece of [ __ ]

1302.24 --> 1307.72
he's just making it into junk because he

1304.76 --> 1307.72
doesn't want to be caught

1308.0 --> 1313.52
he doesn't want to be caught out on any

1310.039 --> 1315.559
of the details of it it's really

1313.52 --> 1318.2
pathetic

1315.559 --> 1320.12
especially if you're still if you still

1318.2 --> 1322.94
consider if you're still going to

1320.12 --> 1325.4799999999998
consider himself to be serious about it

1322.94 --> 1325.48
after that

1332.299 --> 1335.12
so

1334.039 --> 1340.299
yeah

1335.12 --> 1340.299
I mean that's it it's pathetic

1352.22 --> 1354.64
right

1358.72 --> 1361.72
thank you

1363.32 --> 1368.6589999999999
so yeah I mean you didn't prove there is

1366.14 --> 1373.0590000000002
no Rising Earth iron 26 but you did

1368.659 --> 1373.0590000000002
prove that is an incohesive clown

1373.4 --> 1379.46
that doesn't have a full oversight grasp

1376.52 --> 1381.74
on his own conception that he embraced

1379.46 --> 1383.72
so vividly

1381.74 --> 1386.38
he literally doesn't understand his own

1383.72 --> 1386.38
conception here

1400.76 --> 1403.419
right

1414.62 --> 1417.76
all right so anyway

1419.92 --> 1423.919
[Music]

1421.28 --> 1426.5
personally I'm rather impressed by my

1423.919 --> 1428.6000000000001
own show yesterday

1426.5 --> 1430.94
I really like the whole

1428.6 --> 1433.9399999999998
Gates of abalone

1430.94 --> 1436.4
because it's it's a pretty decent

1433.94 --> 1439.76
comparison

1436.4 --> 1442.1200000000001
to tightening the loop and what it would

1439.76 --> 1442.12
be like

1443.0 --> 1447.86
so I like that I

1444.86 --> 1450.559
basically found Gates of Avalon

1447.86 --> 1454.2199999999998
as like a better more attention

1450.559 --> 1458.48
attracting and logically connected name

1454.22 --> 1459.679
to the potential effect of a tight Loop

1458.48 --> 1462.52
game

1459.679 --> 1462.52
I like that

1469.1 --> 1474.98
I don't know if you guys really caught

1471.5 --> 1476.84
on to it or we were just like wow Arwin

1474.98 --> 1479.3600000000001
is doing his thing again

1476.84 --> 1481.82
sounds really amazing but we don't

1479.36 --> 1483.26
really get it it's hard it's really hard

1481.82 --> 1487.96
to tell because you guys don't really

1483.26 --> 1487.96
give a lot of the in detail feedback

1490.039 --> 1494.78
I mean I got some questions about oh

1492.62 --> 1497.78
what if you're literally seeing yourself

1494.78 --> 1502.0
within the loop that's where I got a

1497.78 --> 1502.0
couple of questions but overall

1502.64 --> 1507.3200000000002
you guys just seem to like

1504.86 --> 1510.9799999999998
stand back and just let it all play out

1507.32 --> 1513.32
mostly when I do that sort of thing

1510.98 --> 1516.88
so often I don't really know how much of

1513.32 --> 1516.8799999999999
it is really understood by you

1519.14 --> 1523.159
but I thought yesterday was a pretty

1521.6 --> 1525.9399999999998
clear

1523.159 --> 1525.94
description

1528.559 --> 1531.279
of it

1537.45 --> 1542.98
[Music]

1539.48 --> 1542.98
someone had said he

1544.159 --> 1550.279
he changed this too pretty but it's

1548.659 --> 1553.8400000000001
pretty recently

1550.279 --> 1553.84
as in last night

1560.419 --> 1566.98
during his show did his tone change

1563.419 --> 1566.98
during his show I didn't see it

1568.76 --> 1572.86
we're still talking about Dell I take it

1577.82 --> 1582.86
a weight you're talking about when he

1580.58 --> 1586.6589999999999
changed when he did he get onto the

1582.86 --> 1586.6589999999999
upward Rising thing

1587.12 --> 1590.5
I don't know when that was

1593.179 --> 1596.26
a few months ago

1600.679 --> 1604.64
but I think it's probably the idea had

1602.779 --> 1607.46
been sitting in his mind for quite a

1604.64 --> 1610.0
while because I mean I've brought it up

1607.46 --> 1610.0
before

1611.84 --> 1617.36
I've brought it up as a possibility or a

1615.5 --> 1621.26
conceptual positive the way to think of

1617.36 --> 1624.02
it right I did it like it

1621.26 --> 1626.299
when me and Riley were up against one

1624.02 --> 1630.62
another with the whole gravity debacle

1626.299 --> 1634.6589999999999
even then Adele watched me back then he

1630.62 --> 1634.6589999999999
did also follow my show back then

1634.7 --> 1643.179
so he's seen it for a while and it just

1639.02 --> 1643.179
I don't know why decided to

1645.08 --> 1650.02
just go on board that train all of a

1647.24 --> 1650.02
sudden and do that

1651.559 --> 1657.08
two months ago yeah yeah

1654.26 --> 1659.26
indeed slow morning buggy good to see

1657.08 --> 1659.26
you

1659.96 --> 1664.96
oh wait you're already here

1662.539 --> 1664.96
right

1672.679 --> 1679.299
I'm gonna take a sip of this it's

1675.679 --> 1679.299
definitely hot enough for that

1681.64 --> 1685.179
oh come on

1686.679 --> 1689.679
all right

1694.58 --> 1700.059
I can't believe why that's so difficult

1697.159 --> 1700.0590000000002
every damn time

1704.9 --> 1707.6200000000001
cheers

1710.07 --> 1713.29
[Music]

1716.12 --> 1718.4189999999999
foreign

1726.26 --> 1731.9
do I order it online

1729.26 --> 1736.94
no

1731.9 --> 1736.94
no I get it at the organic supermarket

1738.98 --> 1744.32
I think if you're gonna order it online

1740.84 --> 1746.98
you have to order like a huge tray of it

1744.32 --> 1746.98
probably

1754.46 --> 1759.46
might not actually be that bad at night

1756.98 --> 1759.46
an idea

1763.34 --> 1766.6
I wonder if I could do that

1769.64 --> 1772.679
[Music]

1775.279 --> 1777.64
perfect

1791.419 --> 1793.72
foreign

1793.88 --> 1798.74
I need to get to bed earlier

1796.94 --> 1802.159
I really need the foot I've been like

1798.74 --> 1803.84
staying up like past three like or three

1802.159 --> 1804.8600000000001
days in a row I don't know why it keeps

1803.84 --> 1807.26
happening

1804.86 --> 1809.9189999999999
but it's not good for my focus

1807.26 --> 1813.8799999999999
next day

1809.919 --> 1813.88
a terror 306

1821.96 --> 1827.08
all right let's see go look around

1824.299 --> 1827.08
what's happening

1835.299 --> 1838.4189999999999
you know

1850.52 --> 1853.4189999999999
okay

1854.96 --> 1862.659
just everybody in media is going crazy

1857.659 --> 1862.659
and like gamma and [ __ ] it's so annoying

1863.72 --> 1868.279
but apparently it uh

1866.539 --> 1871.58
where's that

1868.279 --> 1875.899
in North Carolina apparently a

1871.58 --> 1879.1589999999999
a Pfizer production plant was blown up

1875.899 --> 1879.1589999999999
thanks to a tornado

1880.279 --> 1885.08
like squashed the place

1882.26 --> 1887.86
and they're all like oh Karma

1885.08 --> 1887.86
okay

1888.26 --> 1894.86
still gonna be a lot of pollution there

1891.98 --> 1897.46
oh yeah shivas yeah yeah

1894.86 --> 1897.4599999999998
indeed

1908.36 --> 1911.36
burnt

1913.25 --> 1920.0
[Music]

1914.779 --> 1921.02
well or just dismantled and cleaned up I

1920.0 --> 1922.82
mean

1921.02 --> 1926.299
the [ __ ] that they're dealing with

1922.82 --> 1930.5
that's literally a toxic hazard

1926.299 --> 1933.9189999999999
and it burning it might might work

1930.5 --> 1936.02
but I mean just proper careful chemical

1933.919 --> 1938.96
cleanup

1936.02 --> 1941.74
would be best to just like get all the

1938.96 --> 1945.279
toxic [ __ ] out of there to have it

1941.74 --> 1945.279
neutralized carefully

1949.22 --> 1953.6000000000001
right because if you're gonna burn it

1951.32 --> 1955.82
they're still gonna be toxic gases

1953.6 --> 1958.1
coming from that no doubt that are just

1955.82 --> 1960.02
gonna vent off in the atmosphere

1958.1 --> 1962.1789999999999
or in the air

1960.02 --> 1964.8799999999999
so

1962.179 --> 1966.8600000000001
I get the idea I will burn it down but I

1964.88 --> 1971.1200000000001
mean I'd rather just have them close

1966.86 --> 1973.399
down and then carefully dismantle

1971.12 --> 1975.3799999999999
because it's a chemical waste Factory

1973.399 --> 1977.9799999999998
basically

1975.38 --> 1977.98
crazy

1979.46 --> 1985.0
I think it's absolutely insane that

1981.86 --> 1985.0
these places exist

1985.58 --> 1992.299
and it's mostly based on completely

1988.7 --> 1994.5800000000002
false medical premise anyways like

1992.299 --> 2000.179
these things run

1994.58 --> 2000.1789999999999
on a idea that literally doesn't exist

2002.44 --> 2007.74
like most of it literally does not exist

2005.019 --> 2007.74
it's crazy

2008.919 --> 2011.1000000000001
foreign

2028.05 --> 2031.099
[Music]

2037.76 --> 2043.469
[Music]

2053.2 --> 2059.22
why aren't railroads used more often as

2055.419 --> 2059.22
a flat Earth roof big

2059.26 --> 2064.8
yeah straight yeah but Kevin K not only

2062.32 --> 2068.98
trains need flat ground

2064.8 --> 2073.119
uh you might have taken notice that

2068.98 --> 2074.8
pretty much all architecture requires

2073.119 --> 2078.2200000000003
flat ground

2074.8 --> 2079.8590000000004
yeah nobody builds the foundation of

2078.22 --> 2082.9599999999996
their buildings

2079.859 --> 2086.46
non-flat all building foundations are

2082.96 --> 2086.46
flat all of them

2089.379 --> 2097.48
and like they let the cement Harden

2093.52 --> 2099.46
from a liquid state perfectly flattened

2097.48 --> 2101.92
and this is perfectly they make it as

2099.46 --> 2105.96
perfectly flat as possible

2101.92 --> 2105.96
can get very accurate these days

2106.119 --> 2112.92
yeah

2108.0 --> 2112.92
architecture is flat not just railroads

2121.599 --> 2127.1800000000003
right but I mean

2123.94 --> 2130.66
by getting into this argument you're

2127.18 --> 2133.06
immediately giving Ballers a an

2130.66 --> 2135.42
opportunity to place false dichotomy

2133.06 --> 2135.42
with you

2137.32 --> 2142.1800000000003
because like this like yeah I see you

2139.54 --> 2146.35
but you can you but this

2142.18 --> 2149.5899999999997
sometimes the railway goes down right

2146.35 --> 2149.5899999999997
[Music]

2150.76 --> 2157.2400000000002
right sometimes a train has to go over a

2155.02 --> 2159.22
hill it's not always busy so they can

2157.24 --> 2161.74
just [ __ ] around with that you you just

2159.22 --> 2164.2
giving them an opportunity

2161.74 --> 2166.839
well if you just say that all Building

2164.2 --> 2169.4199999999996
architecture is flat well that's

2166.839 --> 2171.22
actually the case yeah

2169.42 --> 2174.16
because there's no architect that's

2171.22 --> 2176.859
going to build a floor that's not level

2174.16 --> 2179.3199999999997
and flat

2176.859 --> 2181.839
because that would be a hazard for

2179.32 --> 2183.82
obvious reasons

2181.839 --> 2187.359
we have a floor where it's not even

2183.82 --> 2189.52
things are gonna fall and roll to one

2187.359 --> 2191.7
side Etc

2189.52 --> 2194.56
gonna be very weird

2191.7 --> 2197.56
my grandmother in Amsterdam used to have

2194.56 --> 2201.599
a house there it's very old house

2197.56 --> 2201.599
and it was like

2202.72 --> 2207.4599999999996
I guess that

2205.3 --> 2210.2200000000003
part of the house had sunk or something

2207.46 --> 2214.18
because there was a floor a top floor

2210.22 --> 2215.68
there that was on one side of it it was

2214.18 --> 2219.2799999999997
like

2215.68 --> 2220.56
10 or 20 centimeters lower than on the

2219.28 --> 2223.0600000000004
other

2220.56 --> 2226.2599999999998
originally that was flat but it

2223.06 --> 2229.2999999999997
literally had sank over like a century

2226.26 --> 2230.8590000000004
and that's [ __ ] freaky man I I mean

2229.3 --> 2233.92
that room

2230.859 --> 2238.42
scared me because that was pretty damn

2233.92 --> 2241.06
high too that was like higher than this

2238.42 --> 2243.66
so it would be like as high as the tree

2241.06 --> 2243.66
up there

2244.0 --> 2248.32
think of like

2245.68 --> 2250.48
fourth fifth floor

2248.32 --> 2253.42
and then

2250.48 --> 2255.04
like a floor that goes like that oh that

2253.42 --> 2258.16
you could literally see it with your

2255.04 --> 2259.48
eyes how slanted it is that freaked me

2258.16 --> 2261.8199999999997
out because it always gave me that

2259.48 --> 2265.18
feeling ah I'm gonna slip and then roll

2261.82 --> 2268.3590000000004
over and then fall through the wall

2265.18 --> 2271.0
straight outside that's yeah

2268.359 --> 2272.859
they build it flat they build it all

2271.0 --> 2276.28
flat there's no yeah

2272.859 --> 2279.46
and reels might go over

2276.28 --> 2283.599
a hill or through a valley

2279.46 --> 2286.26
but buildings are definitely built flat

2283.599 --> 2286.26
all of them

2300.16 --> 2306.06
see they're playing around with it

2302.619 --> 2306.06
that's just what happens

2319.48 --> 2324.42
right but I mean it's technically much

2322.0 --> 2327.7
more interesting to not get so

2324.42 --> 2331.48
oriented about the substances

2327.7 --> 2332.9199999999996
and just realize that all map making and

2331.48 --> 2335.2
all navigation

2332.92 --> 2336.76
is only possible because the Earth is

2335.2 --> 2339.22
flat

2336.76 --> 2341.32
and if the worth would have actually

2339.22 --> 2343.4199999999996
been a physical ball

2341.32 --> 2346.98
that we would have never been able to

2343.42 --> 2346.98
figure out navigation

2348.52 --> 2355.06
like on a ball

2351.88 --> 2359.38
being surrounded by his an apparent

2355.06 --> 2362.7
sphere of stars is not functional like

2359.38 --> 2362.7000000000003
it won't work

2365.56 --> 2373.48
ever realized that it's like

2368.56 --> 2378.22
because of God's magnanimous wisdom

2373.48 --> 2381.82
in design and fractal application

2378.22 --> 2383.859
for The Logical maximum potential

2381.82 --> 2386.56
of ability

2383.859 --> 2389.68
of the intelligent Consciousness the

2386.56 --> 2392.5
Earth would have to be flat because if

2389.68 --> 2394.96
it wasn't flat then you couldn't do

2392.5 --> 2397.14
navigation and people would never get to

2394.96 --> 2400.78
a

2397.14 --> 2402.8199999999997
navigating area they would always be

2400.78 --> 2405.3390000000004
directly involved with their direct

2402.82 --> 2406.599
surroundings and that's it they would go

2405.339 --> 2408.82
with what they were familiar with

2406.599 --> 2411.82
because you couldn't rely on the stars

2408.82 --> 2413.5
for navigation if the Earth were alone

2411.82 --> 2416.1400000000003
yeah

2413.5 --> 2418.42
now that's an argument like what are you

2416.14 --> 2420.4
gonna say what are you gonna say as a

2418.42 --> 2423.339
baller to that nothing there's nothing

2420.4 --> 2425.02
you can't say there's no like Little

2423.339 --> 2426.22
Falls that caught to me you could play

2425.02 --> 2427.9
into

2426.22 --> 2431.859
because it's just

2427.9 --> 2434.94
a mechanical end conclusion

2431.859 --> 2434.94
that's very true

2438.76 --> 2445.5
but I guess that sometimes you just want

2441.82 --> 2448.3
to get a ball or going it's like

2445.5 --> 2450.16
gambling or something it's like yeah you

2448.3 --> 2452.32
know they're defeated but you want to

2450.16 --> 2454.859
play the game and then yeah sure it's

2452.32 --> 2454.8590000000004
like oh

2457.18 --> 2461.44
trains prove it's flat well that's

2459.339 --> 2463.7799999999997
definite if you're gonna say trains blue

2461.44 --> 2466.66
proves it's flat then that's definitely

2463.78 --> 2467.92
gonna get Ballers out of there

2466.66 --> 2470.02
shell

2467.92 --> 2470.92
and start saying but oh they go over a

2470.02 --> 2473.079
hill

2470.92 --> 2475.7200000000003
and then I feel oh wait we might have a

2473.079 --> 2479.98
chance we might have a chance again

2475.72 --> 2482.3799999999997
because this isolated incidence incident

2479.98 --> 2486.04
that we're now discussing it might turn

2482.38 --> 2488.1400000000003
out to be a ball after all right so yeah

2486.04 --> 2491.2599999999998
if you want to lure a baller out of

2488.14 --> 2494.14
their shell like a crab you have to

2491.26 --> 2496.96
basically give them the

2494.14 --> 2498.5789999999997
feeling of opportunity that they might

2496.96 --> 2503.8
win

2498.579 --> 2503.8
because usually of a dichotomy

2504.4 --> 2508.54
right

2505.839 --> 2511.32
but if you do what I just said

2508.54 --> 2513.7
like remind them that like yeah

2511.32 --> 2516.339
navigation map making wouldn't be

2513.7 --> 2519.46
possible we wouldn't have that on a ball

2516.339 --> 2520.7799999999997
because of how it actually works yeah

2519.46 --> 2522.04
there's not they're not going to come

2520.78 --> 2524.619
out of their shell they're definitely

2522.04 --> 2526.72
going to stay in their shell

2524.619 --> 2528.94
when you do that because there's no

2526.72 --> 2531.04
false dichotomy

2528.94 --> 2535.0
you're presenting that they can play

2531.04 --> 2537.52
into in order to give the ball a chance

2535.0 --> 2541.32
for a second

2537.52 --> 2541.32
give it a bit of consideration again

2542.14 --> 2545.16
see how that works

2549.9 --> 2555.7000000000003
right anyway

2552.7 --> 2555.7
cheers

2556.3 --> 2558.8390000000004
hmm

2561.61 --> 2564.7290000000003
[Music]

2588.46 --> 2593.859
they're just brainwashed well you could

2591.579 --> 2597.599
see it like that yeah

2593.859 --> 2597.5989999999997
it's more like an obsession though

2598.0 --> 2603.9
ball Earth is like an obsession you're

2600.819 --> 2603.9
afraid to let go

2604.359 --> 2608.7999999999997
because if you let it go you might see

2606.52 --> 2610.359
everything else and then you will have

2608.8 --> 2613.0600000000004
this strong feeling like you've been

2610.359 --> 2615.16
fooled all your life and you're [ __ ]

2613.06 --> 2617.56
you got nothing left

2615.16 --> 2621.46
that Sensation that dread in the

2617.56 --> 2624.54
distance is what keeps a baller from

2621.46 --> 2624.54
letting it go

2625.96 --> 2631.7200000000003
in a way you could metaphorically

2628.619 --> 2633.88
metaphysically see the ball Earth

2631.72 --> 2635.3799999999997
is like a

2633.88 --> 2637.3
cloak

2635.38 --> 2639.76
that they wear

2637.3 --> 2642.0
to protect themselves from the fires of

2639.76 --> 2642.0
hell

2644.14 --> 2649.96
like but they are then in hell right

2647.56 --> 2651.4
but the ball protects them from that now

2649.96 --> 2654.7
the only way to get out of hell is to

2651.4 --> 2656.56
actually face the flames

2654.7 --> 2659.0789999999997
know what is what

2656.56 --> 2660.46
and then get the hell out of there

2659.079 --> 2662.319
they don't do that they collect

2660.46 --> 2664.96
themselves in

2662.319 --> 2667.839
in the bowl idea and so they can remain

2664.96 --> 2669.579
in hell and be okay with that because

2667.839 --> 2671.0789999999997
they got that protection but that means

2669.579 --> 2673.44
that they can never let that protection

2671.079 --> 2673.44
go

2676.96 --> 2681.3
because then they'd have to face the

2678.88 --> 2681.3
flames

2681.819 --> 2686.68
right

2683.02 --> 2690.099
oh by the way interesting metaphor right

2686.68 --> 2692.7
fires of hell that idea is very archaic

2690.099 --> 2692.7000000000003
very old

2692.74 --> 2698.0989999999997
Catholic in origin probably

2695.26 --> 2701.8590000000004
but then there's the

2698.099 --> 2706.7400000000002
Elemental approach from me

2701.859 --> 2706.74
where fire is also consciousness

2708.18 --> 2712.14
because isn't that interesting

2712.9 --> 2719.2000000000003
right consciousness

2716.26 --> 2722.1400000000003
does kind of bring hell at times it is

2719.2 --> 2725.02
Fire and Fire is hot

2722.14 --> 2727.839
and it is like hell sometimes it's very

2725.02 --> 2730.3
bright you have to be

2727.839 --> 2733.859
strong or you'll just melt away and then

2730.3 --> 2733.8590000000004
you'll lose that Focus again

2739.66 --> 2744.22
and it's funny because yeah

2742.54 --> 2746.859
if you have that cloak of protection

2744.22 --> 2748.72
against hell against Consciousness in

2746.859 --> 2750.2799999999997
this sense in this case you could met

2748.72 --> 2752.16
the physically say that hell and

2750.28 --> 2756.8390000000004
Consciousness is the same thing

2752.16 --> 2756.839
effectively isn't that fascinating

2757.18 --> 2762.8799999999997
that the ball cloak

2759.28 --> 2764.02
give you a feigned higher Consciousness

2762.88 --> 2766.1800000000003
position

2764.02 --> 2767.8
thanks to the cloak

2766.18 --> 2769.4199999999996
but it's not real

2767.8 --> 2772.0
you know as soon as you lose the cloak

2769.42 --> 2775.2000000000003
you realize you don't have anything and

2772.0 --> 2775.2
you should get the hell out of there

2775.9 --> 2781.54
right you step down from the higher

2778.06 --> 2784.119
Consciousness level from the staircase

2781.54 --> 2786.94
but the ball gives you this faint

2784.119 --> 2788.079
protection you think you're smarter you

2786.94 --> 2790.78
really do

2788.079 --> 2794.44
when you have the cloak of the ball

2790.78 --> 2797.26
it's like publicly available and

2794.44 --> 2799.359
and people that were really good at

2797.26 --> 2801.5200000000004
figuring out the ball stuff used to be

2799.359 --> 2804.96
like revered by people they used to be

2801.52 --> 2804.96
like wow you are very smart

2805.78 --> 2808.599
you know a lot of detail things don't

2807.579 --> 2810.579
you

2808.599 --> 2813.1800000000003
right

2810.579 --> 2813.1800000000003
but

2814.119 --> 2818.44
now

2815.68 --> 2820.06
now that it's more understood this more

2818.44 --> 2821.98
commonly understood that there's a lot

2820.06 --> 2824.68
of things wrong

2821.98 --> 2827.38
and Flat Earth and all that exists

2824.68 --> 2828.5789999999997
there's alternative views now attempts

2827.38 --> 2832.26
at least

2828.579 --> 2832.26
it goes all over the place but

2832.839 --> 2836.0789999999997
so people don't really have that

2834.579 --> 2838.8390000000004
response anymore

2836.079 --> 2842.6800000000003
like they used to

2838.839 --> 2845.44
oh you know all this technical math

2842.68 --> 2847.96
stuff wow you are really smart

2845.44 --> 2849.94
really well informed we don't learn that

2847.96 --> 2851.619
stuff in detail we don't know that we

2849.94 --> 2856.7400000000002
just know about work about things that

2851.619 --> 2856.7400000000002
actually are useful right working class

2857.44 --> 2864.099
but now yeah that it's kind of naturally

2861.579 --> 2865.54
if you just if you're with God you do

2864.099 --> 2868.1800000000003
the good things

2865.54 --> 2871.0
over the generations well the staircase

2868.18 --> 2872.44
will climb like it will happen you'll be

2871.0 --> 2874.48
forced to because everything becomes

2872.44 --> 2878.04
tougher it's like this you need climbing

2874.48 --> 2878.04
a staircase provides an edge

2880.119 --> 2885.7000000000003
and so it's all pushed further up

2882.46 --> 2887.859
further into hell in that sense too

2885.7 --> 2889.5989999999997
psychological warfare is coming out of

2887.859 --> 2892.18
that

2889.599 --> 2895.48
right psychological warfare comes out of

2892.18 --> 2897.339
somebody that figured that out when

2895.48 --> 2900.52
through hell went on a higher staircase

2897.339 --> 2901.54
of Consciousness to certainly see how it

2900.52 --> 2903.7
works

2901.54 --> 2906.16
with the people that

2903.7 --> 2908.319
that are not attaining that

2906.16 --> 2912.2799999999997
consciousness

2908.319 --> 2914.8
and that's how it was then made

2912.28 --> 2916.3590000000004
social engineering all that as a trick

2914.8 --> 2918.4
and it's elite trick and we're all like

2916.359 --> 2921.04
what are they doing why they do that why

2918.4 --> 2923.26
how are they getting away with this

2921.04 --> 2925.06
now it's understood social engineering

2923.26 --> 2927.579
it's even being freaking standardized so

2925.06 --> 2931.48
now even numpties they don't understand

2927.579 --> 2932.5600000000004
social engineering at all can just buy

2931.48 --> 2936.7
memory

2932.56 --> 2938.619
and training use social refined higher

2936.7 --> 2940.8999999999996
Consciousness based social engineering

2938.619 --> 2941.98
tricks even though they don't understand

2940.9 --> 2944.079
it

2941.98 --> 2946.599
so everything becomes kind of like an

2944.079 --> 2947.98
echo chamber of that original higher

2946.599 --> 2949.42
Consciousness that attained that

2947.98 --> 2952.42
information

2949.42 --> 2955.319
even though it's all hollowed out it

2952.42 --> 2955.319
becomes like a

2955.96 --> 2961.599
an armor like a chanting system right

2959.38 --> 2964.0
it's the same thing that that basically

2961.599 --> 2966.28
happened with

2964.0 --> 2967.96
a lot of people in religion and how the

2966.28 --> 2969.6400000000003
religion itself developed right yeah

2967.96 --> 2971.7400000000002
Christ

2969.64 --> 2973.48
then he had all these people inspired by

2971.74 --> 2975.819
him and his teachings

2973.48 --> 2978.64
and then eventually it'd be like no no

2975.819 --> 2980.88
but it's people start to getting

2978.64 --> 2983.98
relaying the focus towards more

2980.88 --> 2986.5
Territorial and ego related things and

2983.98 --> 2989.079
so like oh it's really important

2986.5 --> 2991.54
that he said that and because now

2989.079 --> 2994.98
suddenly what he says like oh you have

2991.54 --> 2994.98
to agree with it or you go to hell

2995.319 --> 3000.48
that sort of thing that's then conjure

2998.079 --> 3002.28
because of the degrading of the average

3000.48 --> 3005.54
consciousness

3002.28 --> 3005.5400000000004
so they're using

3005.66 --> 3010.5
higher attained wisdom through higher

3008.339 --> 3011.46
Consciousness get passed on through

3010.5 --> 3013.619
Christ

3011.46 --> 3016.2
that's been set it's right there for

3013.619 --> 3018.119
anybody to recognize but if everybody's

3016.2 --> 3020.2799999999997
conscience is lower then suddenly it

3018.119 --> 3023.2200000000003
doesn't mean the same things because you

3020.28 --> 3025.079
don't care about that you see

3023.22 --> 3028.2
you're too preoccupied with Earthly

3025.079 --> 3031.5
things and social dances and all that

3028.2 --> 3034.7999999999997
and so now you're going to reinterpret

3031.5 --> 3036.0
those higher Consciousness based wisdom

3034.8 --> 3041.4
things

3036.0 --> 3044.52
to fit your game your social game

3041.4 --> 3047.099
and that's how like you get the chanting

3044.52 --> 3050.16
and the prestification

3047.099 --> 3053.6400000000003
within religion or certainly

3050.16 --> 3056.94
people reinterpret

3053.64 --> 3060.859
very Universal wise things

3056.94 --> 3063.059
to accommodate for a slightly lower

3060.859 --> 3064.98
Consciousness based approach which is

3063.059 --> 3066.3
more like fitting to The Wider public

3064.98 --> 3069.0
right

3066.3 --> 3070.1400000000003
but it isn't the original insights at

3069.0 --> 3073.88
all

3070.14 --> 3073.8799999999997
it's not the same consciousness

3074.22 --> 3079.52
right because they wouldn't go through

3077.28 --> 3079.52
hell

3080.46 --> 3086.099
higher Consciousness consciousness of

3082.619 --> 3088.2000000000003
fire it wouldn't go through the fire

3086.099 --> 3090.0
but they definitely remember somebody

3088.2 --> 3092.7599999999998
having gone through the fire any wisdom

3090.0 --> 3095.16
that they brought they would they know

3092.76 --> 3098.5200000000004
they kind of need to respect that

3095.16 --> 3101.8999999999996
but they can't use it so they'll like

3098.52 --> 3101.9
make a statue out of it

3102.72 --> 3105.7999999999997
see how that works

3115.2 --> 3119.22
I don't know if anybody's following me

3116.88 --> 3122.4
but yeah consciousness

3119.22 --> 3124.64
fire of Consciousness and the fires of

3122.4 --> 3124.64
hell

3125.04 --> 3128.48
they might be related

3144.839 --> 3149.52
and it could even be very interesting

3147.119 --> 3150.48
conception to like a thought experiment

3149.52 --> 3153.24
here

3150.48 --> 3155.28
for Spirit people for people that it

3153.24 --> 3156.66
really are like very spiritual even

3155.28 --> 3159.8590000000004
religious

3156.66 --> 3159.859
to consider that

3160.44 --> 3164.819
if higher conscience is literally

3162.66 --> 3166.2
conjures the Flames of hell

3164.819 --> 3169.5
well

3166.2 --> 3171.8999999999996
having a great High idea that's really

3169.5 --> 3173.7
good and like christ-like it gives that

3171.9 --> 3176.04
feeling

3173.7 --> 3178.14
that brings fire but it doesn't burn you

3176.04 --> 3180.3
it only burns the wicked doesn't it

3178.14 --> 3182.22
right it's like Christ speaks up says

3180.3 --> 3184.92
something universally wise and certainly

3182.22 --> 3187.319
people feel like oh no

3184.92 --> 3191.04
but they'll lose my little thingy or

3187.319 --> 3194.16
whatever right so the sinful are the

3191.04 --> 3196.38
ones that are actually burnt by the fire

3194.16 --> 3198.42
of Consciousness to them fire of

3196.38 --> 3199.8
Consciousness is the fire the Flames of

3198.42 --> 3202.319
hell

3199.8 --> 3204.599
so Consciousness the fire of

3202.319 --> 3208.859
consciousness

3204.599 --> 3211.52
could literally be the Flames of Hell to

3208.859 --> 3211.52
the wicked

3216.599 --> 3222.44
isn't that just fascinating

3219.48 --> 3226.14
right it would also explain how

3222.44 --> 3229.88
Jesus as foretold in the Bible at least

3226.14 --> 3232.68
I don't know how much it is

3229.88 --> 3235.46
metaphysically acceptable and logical to

3232.68 --> 3238.9199999999996
me that that happened in there

3235.46 --> 3241.319
that he went into hell right he went

3238.92 --> 3243.859
into hell to face the demons

3241.319 --> 3243.859
well

3244.859 --> 3251.7
the fires of hell wouldn't hurt him

3248.099 --> 3255.48
because he had no sin

3251.7 --> 3258.2999999999997
so you imagine if he like oh you're a

3255.48 --> 3261.2400000000002
bird in the Lake of Fire like dude Jesus

3258.3 --> 3263.3390000000004
would literally walk the Lake of Fire as

3261.24 --> 3264.8999999999996
he would walk

3263.339 --> 3267.359
the waters

3264.9 --> 3270.26
because it wouldn't hurt him he doesn't

3267.359 --> 3270.2599999999998
have any sin

3276.48 --> 3281.04
he just has the Consciousness so he when

3279.48 --> 3285.359
you have the Consciousness but you have

3281.04 --> 3287.88
no sin then you'll see how those that

3285.359 --> 3289.92
attain that level of Consciousness could

3287.88 --> 3291.6600000000003
be Wicked and then how that would hurt

3289.92 --> 3294.7200000000003
them

3291.66 --> 3295.98
but it's only the wicked that have the

3294.72 --> 3299.64
higher conscious

3295.98 --> 3301.68
and the sin to which the flame of

3299.64 --> 3305.339
Consciousness are the Flames of hell

3301.68 --> 3307.94
because if people become aware of it it

3305.339 --> 3307.94
burns

3310.57 --> 3313.76
[Music]

3315.24 --> 3320.8999999999996
I'm gonna put this in it it's the main

3317.28 --> 3320.9
amazing title

3329.28 --> 3332.369
[Music]

3332.579 --> 3337.38
and it's even in the 666 title this is

3336.0 --> 3341.72
awesome

3337.38 --> 3341.7200000000003
thank you God thank you for providing

3342.18 --> 3344.8999999999996
thank you

3348.96 --> 3353.66
I could not have wished for a better

3351.059 --> 3353.6600000000003
title

3366.78 --> 3373.2000000000003
not only metaphysically does this fit on

3371.339 --> 3376.14
a fractal level

3373.2 --> 3380.0989999999997
beyond what I expected by the way when I

3376.14 --> 3381.9
first thread walked into this pattern to

3380.099 --> 3384.02
try to describe it this is better than I

3381.9 --> 3384.02
thought

3384.9 --> 3391.2000000000003
but it also I'm basically here to give

3388.74 --> 3394.2799999999997
you a promise

3391.2 --> 3394.2799999999997
through my insight

3394.319 --> 3399.42
like

3396.18 --> 3402.5589999999997
if you have no sin then hell is not a

3399.42 --> 3402.559
place for you to fear

3403.079 --> 3410.6600000000003
not necessarily because you won't go

3405.54 --> 3410.66
there who knows right on the other side

3411.96 --> 3416.579
after death

3413.46 --> 3420.96
but if you're not Wicked

3416.579 --> 3423.8390000000004
then you might see terrible things but

3420.96 --> 3426.7200000000003
at best it will give like

3423.839 --> 3427.74
why why do they do that why they're so

3426.72 --> 3430.9199999999996
foolish

3427.74 --> 3433.2599999999998
it won't hurt you it won't make you fair

3430.92 --> 3436.26
won't scare you because you are not

3433.26 --> 3439.7000000000003
Wicked you have don't have that sin that

3436.26 --> 3439.7000000000003
makes it hurt

3441.839 --> 3445.099
isn't that good news

3445.5 --> 3451.44
and interesting it does fit the

3448.319 --> 3454.92
metaphysics of Christ's promise

3451.44 --> 3457.92
yeah it's like do as I do Christ

3454.92 --> 3460.619
speaking do as I do

3457.92 --> 3463.859
and you're you're good

3460.619 --> 3467.28
why because if you do as I do you too

3463.859 --> 3469.619
will be without sin or very little sin

3467.28 --> 3470.6400000000003
and then you have nothing to fear after

3469.619 --> 3473.4
death

3470.64 --> 3474.359
because the Flames of Hell the wicked

3473.4 --> 3476.94
ones

3474.359 --> 3477.96
they want her to they won't take

3476.94 --> 3480.54
anything

3477.96 --> 3483.319
you will be with God you will be free

3480.54 --> 3483.319
with God

3486.119 --> 3491.0
am I getting through to everybody here

3501.059 --> 3507.3
oh my God in the meantime the church

3504.359 --> 3511.5
just blabbering on about Rockets

3507.3 --> 3511.5
amongst themselves Jesus

3516.599 --> 3523.2200000000003
the good thing that I'm here to take

3518.52 --> 3523.22
notice of this revolutionary new insight

3524.339 --> 3526.88
foreign

3554.72 --> 3558.14
Catholic what

3560.16 --> 3563.1189999999997
how dare you

3573.0 --> 3576.98
what what does a Catholic sound like

3579.299 --> 3583.28
I mean I don't swear that much

3586.38 --> 3590.46
I'm not

3588.299 --> 3592.38
a heavy drinker or anything not that all

3590.46 --> 3594.7200000000003
Catholics are but

3592.38 --> 3597.1400000000003
like what about me makes me sound like a

3594.72 --> 3597.14
Catholic

3597.359 --> 3601.859
I was literally literally pointing out

3599.76 --> 3604.619
the metaphysics right

3601.859 --> 3607.5789999999997
because yeah I criticize including

3604.619 --> 3610.559
Catholics and other Orthodox

3607.579 --> 3615.059
he is his father he prayed he didn't

3610.559 --> 3616.98
pray to himself or he fulfilled yeah I

3615.059 --> 3620.119
criticized that

3616.98 --> 3624.359
but that doesn't mean that when Jesus

3620.119 --> 3628.1400000000003
speaks and not literally says those

3624.359 --> 3629.5789999999997
things like what the priests say it

3628.14 --> 3632.4
means

3629.579 --> 3635.119
I still listen I listen to his

3632.4 --> 3635.119
metaphysics

3636.18 --> 3642.359
and then I compare

3638.88 --> 3646.26
those metaphysical patterns

3642.359 --> 3648.0
two things that I see

3646.26 --> 3649.38
like comparing the Flames of

3648.0 --> 3652.02
consciousness

3649.38 --> 3655.98
to the Flames of hell

3652.02 --> 3658.799
it's fascinating it's fascinating if you

3655.98 --> 3662.78
see it if you can look like that how it

3658.799 --> 3662.78
fits like a glove

3667.14 --> 3675.54
and so my lore of the Elementals

3671.28 --> 3680.0400000000004
and the aspects of the being

3675.54 --> 3683.46
right that comparison cross-referencing

3680.04 --> 3685.079
with the law of Christ

3683.46 --> 3687.78
and

3685.079 --> 3693.119
The More Human Experience of the

3687.78 --> 3696.2400000000002
dichotomy of wickedness and good

3693.119 --> 3700.1400000000003
I found it to fit

3696.24 --> 3702.359
like certainly click clock work whoa it

3700.14 --> 3704.8799999999997
was designed to fit

3702.359 --> 3708.799
okay that's what I just [ __ ] figured

3704.88 --> 3708.799
out it's my first swear word here

3712.14 --> 3717.42
yeah and I didn't plan for this

3714.78 --> 3719.599
it literally happened right here on the

3717.42 --> 3719.599
show

3723.079 --> 3727.6800000000003
but apparently it's more important to

3725.28 --> 3729.0
talk about supposed satellites up there

3727.68 --> 3732.1989999999996
great

3729.0 --> 3732.199
[Music]

3745.26 --> 3747.38
thank you

3747.96 --> 3752.599
what happened what you mean what

3750.42 --> 3752.599
happened

3774.839 --> 3779.46
oh you said I didn't have yeah my

3776.88 --> 3781.7400000000002
insight the inside I just attained

3779.46 --> 3783.92
Godzilla crying out loud you were right

3781.74 --> 3783.9199999999996
there

3794.299 --> 3799.7599999999998
weren't you did you just get in

3806.059 --> 3811.619
the look the main in

3809.52 --> 3814.559
you want the key to the entire thing

3811.619 --> 3817.7400000000002
it's literally the title

3814.559 --> 3821.3390000000004
it's a pretty radical Insight like a

3817.74 --> 3821.339
Elementary insight

3823.2 --> 3829.2599999999998
or Elementary hey it was about hell too

3826.74 --> 3830.339
isn't that just fascinating and why did

3829.26 --> 3834.7990000000004
the guy

3830.339 --> 3834.799
why would he go into hell and like

3835.68 --> 3839.64
unless

3837.9 --> 3842.1600000000003
like

3839.64 --> 3844.74
this it's really a thing unless the

3842.16 --> 3849.3799999999997
wicked really

3844.74 --> 3849.3799999999997
unless hell is only hell to the wicked

3851.339 --> 3857.54
maybe Consciousness and hell are are

3854.28 --> 3857.5400000000004
very close to one another

3859.26 --> 3864.3190000000004
maybe the flame of Consciousness is the

3861.66 --> 3864.319
flame of hell

3865.68 --> 3870.839
because it burns the wicked

3868.2 --> 3872.52
yeah the wicked hate the higher

3870.839 --> 3874.5589999999997
Consciousness because

3872.52 --> 3876.299
the higher Consciousness while they like

3874.559 --> 3878.099
it for themselves they like the little

3876.299 --> 3880.38
fire but they don't like it to spread

3878.099 --> 3883.92
because if higher Consciousness spreads

3880.38 --> 3886.319
then people won't get fooled

3883.92 --> 3888.96
and then they lose power

3886.319 --> 3891.799
and they'll be exposed for their evil

3888.96 --> 3891.799
for their wickedness

3892.26 --> 3898.3390000000004
so the Flames of Consciousness are like

3894.54 --> 3898.339
the Flames of Hell to the wicked

3909.72 --> 3914.0989999999997
what

3911.16 --> 3916.799
I sound like okay why why do you say

3914.099 --> 3919.8590000000004
that why hello can somebody [ __ ] tell

3916.799 --> 3922.2599999999998
me what the [ __ ] you mean

3919.859 --> 3926.7799999999997
it's the second person now I sound like

3922.26 --> 3926.78
a Catholic what the hell does that mean

3932.16 --> 3936.2
why why do you say that

3941.64 --> 3944.72
the [ __ ] is that meme

3947.94 --> 3951.14
a little more colored

3957.72 --> 3960.72
hey

3963.299 --> 3969.079
okay

3964.52 --> 3969.079
you guys are starting to piss me off

3975.78 --> 3978.3190000000004
foreign

4012.93 --> 4016.12
[Music]

4016.18 --> 4022.4199999999996
what the [ __ ] does that mean

4019.76 --> 4022.42
why

4032.839 --> 4038.42
did I tell you that if you don't believe

4035.68 --> 4040.2799999999997
Jesus Christ was God In the Flesh and

4038.42 --> 4043.16
that he died for your sins and you go to

4040.28 --> 4045.3190000000004
hell did I say that

4043.16 --> 4046.46
because I'm pretty sure that that's like

4045.319 --> 4049.099
the thing

4046.46 --> 4051.64
that really makes it Catholic I didn't

4049.099 --> 4051.6400000000003
say that

4053.93 --> 4057.239
[Music]

4057.26 --> 4060.94
I just made a comparison

4061.039 --> 4067.5200000000004
to the experience

4064.7 --> 4070.0589999999997
of Hell in relation to higher

4067.52 --> 4070.059
consciousness

4073.16 --> 4077.1189999999997
I thought it was a pretty damn good

4075.319 --> 4079.64
analogy

4077.119 --> 4081.619
a great Insight I don't see how that's

4079.64 --> 4083.66
Catholic

4081.619 --> 4085.7000000000003
I mean it's literally not even about

4083.66 --> 4089.8999999999996
life after death

4085.7 --> 4094.0989999999997
it's literally about the life

4089.9 --> 4096.4400000000005
time Bound in the world experience of

4094.099 --> 4099.02
people yeah that's what I'm talking

4096.44 --> 4102.678999999999
about I'm not talking about after death

4099.02 --> 4103.88
and I did bring it up for a bit

4102.679 --> 4106.219
as a

4103.88 --> 4108.819
as a side track

4106.219 --> 4108.819
but

4108.92 --> 4117.08
like I don't think

4111.98 --> 4120.339
hell necessarily is a Eternal after

4117.08 --> 4120.339
place like that

4124.46 --> 4128.9
I've always felt like hell was more

4127.16 --> 4131.3589999999995
something that you experience while

4128.9 --> 4135.04
you're alive

4131.359 --> 4135.04
that the world is hell

4135.08 --> 4139.1
at times

4137.179 --> 4142.819
or most of the times but that you're

4139.1 --> 4145.54
protected from constant exposure of that

4142.819 --> 4145.54
naturally

4146.06 --> 4152.54
but if you attain true awareness and

4149.239 --> 4154.879999999999
responsibility over the Earth then you

4152.54 --> 4156.98
will definitely feel those flames of

4154.88 --> 4160.219
Hell more and more higher Consciousness

4156.98 --> 4163.839
brings more burden more responsibility

4160.219 --> 4163.839
it brings hell with it

4167.239 --> 4174.0199999999995
it's very very rare that people truly

4171.14 --> 4177.5
climb the tree of Consciousness like

4174.02 --> 4182.299000000001
gain a new depth to their being

4177.5 --> 4185.9
and find the new grounds to be better

4182.299 --> 4188.44
than the previous with less hazards

4185.9 --> 4188.44
I mean

4189.62 --> 4194.84
maybe the hazards won't will be less

4192.52 --> 4197.0
destructive but it's there'll be more

4194.84 --> 4198.4400000000005
complicated Yeah the more intelligent

4197.0 --> 4202.46
you are

4198.44 --> 4204.62
as in conscious with your intelligence

4202.46 --> 4207.08
the more you realize that the newer

4204.62 --> 4208.64
insights also bring more complex

4207.08 --> 4210.32
challenges

4208.64 --> 4213.46
more tenacious

4210.32 --> 4213.46
more elusive

4222.92 --> 4227.679
no we didn't die

4225.14 --> 4227.679
no

4227.78 --> 4232.54
no I think hell is metaphysics

4234.44 --> 4239.719
I think hell is like a frequency with

4236.78 --> 4241.58
inner Consciousness where we can go

4239.719 --> 4246.02
and it is

4241.58 --> 4248.42
it truly becomes hell as wickedness

4246.02 --> 4250.76
like with wickedness if you have

4248.42 --> 4252.86
wickedness then hell will actually be

4250.76 --> 4254.4800000000005
like what they describe hell

4252.86 --> 4256.5199999999995
like the Catholics would describe hell

4254.48 --> 4259.459999999999
then it is painful

4256.52 --> 4264.219
but it is the the wickedness the the sin

4259.46 --> 4264.219
that actually makes hell burn

4265.82 --> 4270.159
to the conscience that's undergoing it

4270.38 --> 4276.02
what I'm suggesting and it's not very

4273.38 --> 4277.9400000000005
that's not talked about overtly is that

4276.02 --> 4280.64
you could theoretically go through hell

4277.94 --> 4282.259999999999
if you're clean if you're pure if you

4280.64 --> 4286.3
don't have sin

4282.26 --> 4286.3
then it doesn't hurt you as much

4288.199 --> 4292.54
if you have sin it hurts you more

4295.04 --> 4301.159
because the sin actually makes the hell

4297.679 --> 4302.6
into hell for you or if you don't have

4301.159 --> 4305.0
sin

4302.6 --> 4306.46
it's

4305.0 --> 4309.26
like

4306.46 --> 4311.36
Consciousness and exposure

4309.26 --> 4314.12
it's the exposure effect like what does

4311.36 --> 4315.98
hell do it exposes right

4314.12 --> 4317.48
even symbolic oh what are they doing

4315.98 --> 4319.459999999999
yeah they're undergoing these terrible

4317.48 --> 4321.799999999999
things why well because of those

4319.46 --> 4325.52
terrible things that they did it's like

4321.8 --> 4327.14
an exposition of their sin right I mean

4325.52 --> 4330.8
this is even like in In classical

4327.14 --> 4333.02
Catholic lore about that is like oh this

4330.8 --> 4335.54
person is in hell what is he doing in

4333.02 --> 4337.040000000001
Hell while he's doing that thing that he

4335.54 --> 4339.44
was always doing

4337.04 --> 4341.78
it was so terrible and now he has to do

4339.44 --> 4343.58
it forever right like oh he was a glut

4341.78 --> 4345.62
and he died from a heart attack oh now

4343.58 --> 4347.659
he's in hell and he's just can never

4345.62 --> 4349.64
stop eating and

4347.659 --> 4352.699
and he doesn't want to but he has to

4349.64 --> 4357.08
stuff like they do that why it's an

4352.699 --> 4358.28
expose it's the sin that is magnified by

4357.08 --> 4360.98
the hell

4358.28 --> 4364.099999999999
so by that law if you just stand still

4360.98 --> 4366.98
for a [ __ ] second and think it as of

4364.1 --> 4368.84
it as a metaphysical energy thing then

4366.98 --> 4371.0
you would conclude that if you have no

4368.84 --> 4372.860000000001
sin and you would go to hell now the

4371.0 --> 4376.159
Catholic say oh but you don't go to hell

4372.86 --> 4379.219
man because they all literalize it make

4376.159 --> 4383.0599999999995
it into a literal place you go after

4379.219 --> 4385.34
life if you just see the metaphysically

4383.06 --> 4387.820000000001
as in what happens to your Consciousness

4385.34 --> 4391.6990000000005
with metaphysical

4387.82 --> 4393.199
confrontation in the world experience

4391.699 --> 4395.48
then

4393.199 --> 4397.46
you go through hell

4395.48 --> 4401.48
then

4397.46 --> 4404.42
you only get that hell treatment be

4401.48 --> 4405.739
buried under your sin in hell if you

4404.42 --> 4408.5
have the sin

4405.739 --> 4411.0199999999995
if you don't have the sin

4408.5 --> 4412.699
what is Hell gonna do to you

4411.02 --> 4414.02
nothing

4412.699 --> 4415.94
yes

4414.02 --> 4417.1
right

4415.94 --> 4423.199
because

4417.1 --> 4426.8
that torturous hell is an expose

4423.199 --> 4428.239
it's an expose a to those listening in

4426.8 --> 4431.84
to the story

4428.239 --> 4435.199
and it's literally an Exquisite of the

4431.84 --> 4437.4800000000005
sin the effect itself is an experts a it

4435.199 --> 4440.12
exposes

4437.48 --> 4444.04
like consciousness

4440.12 --> 4444.04
the fires of consciousness

4449.48 --> 4454.159
I don't know about you guys or maybe I'm

4452.0 --> 4456.14
a Catholic now or something I'm secretly

4454.159 --> 4458.36
a Jesuit right I'm always talking about

4456.14 --> 4460.46
the Jesuit guy well maybe it's me I'm

4458.36 --> 4462.679
actually the Jesuit guy and I have

4460.46 --> 4465.199
multiple personality disorder

4462.679 --> 4467.679
which is unwilling to admit the evil

4465.199 --> 4470.48
side of myself

4467.679 --> 4472.6990000000005
I'm actually secretly a Jesuit right

4470.48 --> 4475.82
whatever man

4472.699 --> 4478.219
Whatever Gets you rolling

4475.82 --> 4480.38
I'm just really fascinated about these

4478.219 --> 4484.699
current insights

4480.38 --> 4488.54
how well it fits it makes me understand

4484.699 --> 4492.739
where the Catholics came from with their

4488.54 --> 4495.679
reasoning not the conclusions not what

4492.739 --> 4499.9
they've done with it but where it came

4495.679 --> 4499.9
from I'm appreciating it more

4507.08 --> 4509.679
foreign

4542.659 --> 4545.92
Irish Catholic

4546.26 --> 4553.84
oh it must be talk let's be watching

4548.96 --> 4553.84
your potty mouth or you'll go to hell

4555.08 --> 4560.26
I'll be Blitz burning in the Flames of

4558.02 --> 4560.26
hell

4577.46 --> 4581.84
maybe that was a little bit more

4578.84 --> 4586.12
Scottish yeah I thought so

4581.84 --> 4586.12
I mix Scottish and Irish up sometimes

4591.56 --> 4594.400000000001
I wondered

4594.44 --> 4600.4
I don't think like what how are the

4597.14 --> 4600.400000000001
Scottish with the Catholics

4601.159 --> 4604.9
I can imagine not so great

4634.64 --> 4636.6990000000005
um

4649.71 --> 4652.899
[Music]

4653.239 --> 4655.419999999999
foreign

4670.94 --> 4673.94
that's

4674.9 --> 4678.339999999999
that's just funny Jeff

4680.06 --> 4683.06
right

4683.719 --> 4690.58
but look I don't think that hell

4686.719 --> 4690.58
there's no Eternal torturing

4696.679 --> 4702.08
I don't think so or it might be um a

4700.28 --> 4703.58
place after life that might be a bit

4702.08 --> 4706.46
hell

4703.58 --> 4710.239
but it would be it would be more like

4706.46 --> 4714.199
perfect it would be there to just

4710.239 --> 4717.86
let the sin be the wick

4714.199 --> 4720.62
to your candle no the sin will simply

4717.86 --> 4723.259999999999
make it hurt make it burn until the wick

4720.62 --> 4725.84
is burned out

4723.26 --> 4728.4800000000005
and that's how I think we might

4725.84 --> 4732.34
experience hell

4728.48 --> 4732.339999999999
in a more afterlife sense

4735.739 --> 4740.78
it's like we get our due punishment

4738.32 --> 4743.54
in that sense

4740.78 --> 4746.239
but no eternity

4743.54 --> 4748.699
maybe for some people

4746.239 --> 4751.699
maybe for the actual Wicket that really

4748.699 --> 4754.0
just have done a limited amounts that's

4751.699 --> 4754.0
just

4756.14 --> 4761.42
maybe the people that literally have

4758.78 --> 4764.96
made a habit to spiritually deflect so

4761.42 --> 4768.4400000000005
persistently that when they arrive in

4764.96 --> 4771.02
hell in that stage where basically the

4768.44 --> 4773.659
wick Burns until it's done

4771.02 --> 4776.0
that they basically prevent the wick

4773.659 --> 4778.46
from burning out

4776.0 --> 4779.9
so it might be that people that are

4778.46 --> 4782.12
truly Wicked

4779.9 --> 4784.28
as as they were alive like actually

4782.12 --> 4787.88
really wicked and that's very rare guys

4784.28 --> 4790.219
I mean people we think are super Wicked

4787.88 --> 4791.78
they're not really that Wicked they're

4790.219 --> 4794.42
just really [ __ ] up

4791.78 --> 4797.9
most of the time and just pretending to

4794.42 --> 4801.1990000000005
be Wicked because it's all the rage

4797.9 --> 4804.94
to seem very demonic now

4801.199 --> 4804.94
yeah it's like Bravada

4805.52 --> 4809.06
but

4806.659 --> 4811.099999999999
if you're truly so messed up and you

4809.06 --> 4813.860000000001
have done like really horrendous things

4811.1 --> 4815.179
and like completely compartmentalized it

4813.86 --> 4818.12
and not

4815.179 --> 4819.86
felt any of the punishment of God from

4818.12 --> 4823.46
that ever

4819.86 --> 4826.28
then maybe that disables you

4823.46 --> 4829.46
from actually burning out

4826.28 --> 4831.62
during the afterlife stage where you

4829.46 --> 4834.92
facing your sins

4831.62 --> 4837.98
so then if that happens then you might

4834.92 --> 4841.64
theoretically get stuck

4837.98 --> 4846.04
in it looping because your Wick never

4841.64 --> 4846.04
burns out because of what you've done

4846.98 --> 4851.959999999999
to Eternal Health thing

4849.739 --> 4854.9
it's people that have not just done

4851.96 --> 4857.679
terrible things but have also like super

4854.9 --> 4857.679
denied it

4857.78 --> 4863.599999999999
like insistent like no

4860.96 --> 4867.56
and maybe those people

4863.6 --> 4870.7390000000005
in the afterlife gets stuck in an

4867.56 --> 4873.8
endless loop within the hell stage which

4870.739 --> 4875.959999999999
would result in a practical well get it

4873.8 --> 4877.900000000001
being stuck in hell forever

4875.96 --> 4880.52
because you can never

4877.9 --> 4882.379999999999
relinquish the sin it just keeps burning

4880.52 --> 4885.320000000001
and it keeps burning but the wick never

4882.38 --> 4887.84
burns out so it never stops you never

4885.32 --> 4889.159
move Beyond

4887.84 --> 4891.4400000000005
right

4889.159 --> 4894.739
so from that perspective

4891.44 --> 4896.299999999999
hell would technically be Purgatory the

4894.739 --> 4900.919999999999
idea of purgatory

4896.3 --> 4904.179
but if you're truly wicked wicked

4900.92 --> 4904.179
like a wick

4904.219 --> 4907.659
do a flame

4906.26 --> 4910.88
yeah

4907.659 --> 4912.739
Wicked if you're truly Wicked then

4910.88 --> 4915.02
purgatory

4912.739 --> 4916.25
might literally turn into hell because

4915.02 --> 4918.14
you never get out of it

4916.25 --> 4921.46
[Music]

4918.14 --> 4921.46
isn't that fascinating

4933.679 --> 4940.04
am I not presenting some serious fractal

4937.0 --> 4942.38
Insight or fractal gravy as I would say

4940.04 --> 4946.36
right here I mean this is fractal

4942.38 --> 4946.36
Insight at its best

4947.0 --> 4952.4
fractal Insight at his best

4949.4 --> 4952.4
absolutely

4955.58 --> 4961.04
if I ever want to get that feel of

4958.64 --> 4964.76
fractal Insight in the future I'm gonna

4961.04 --> 4968.84
go back to episode 1666

4964.76 --> 4971.54
to watch me talk about this to remember

4968.84 --> 4972.7390000000005
you want fractal inside this is what it

4971.54 --> 4974.659
is

4972.739 --> 4976.339999999999
when all those things that you just

4974.659 --> 4977.719
thought oh that's interesting oh that's

4976.34 --> 4979.1
interesting oh that's all kind of cool

4977.719 --> 4980.719
collection of things and then silly

4979.1 --> 4983.6
click click click click and it's one

4980.719 --> 4986.06
structure like it always was that's

4983.6 --> 4987.8
fractal Insight that's what's happening

4986.06 --> 4990.9400000000005
right now

4987.8 --> 4990.9400000000005
concerning this

5001.38 --> 5006.0
afterlife because no reasonably I don't

5003.82 --> 5006.0
care

5006.58 --> 5012.34
hey if you want to believe you just end

5008.44 --> 5014.32
well that's fine then you just end

5012.34 --> 5016.4800000000005
unless you don't

5014.32 --> 5019.96
yeah I'm just gonna take precautions

5016.48 --> 5023.259999999999
because if I will just cease to exist

5019.96 --> 5025.659
and there have been suggestions to that

5023.26 --> 5028.719
then so be it then have nothing to worry

5025.659 --> 5031.96
about because I stop existing

5028.719 --> 5035.62
but if I don't stop existing

5031.96 --> 5039.2390000000005
well then I'd better be prepared for as

5035.62 --> 5039.239
far as I could be prepared

5040.06 --> 5045.400000000001
so I'm not just gonna take the risk that

5042.219 --> 5048.84
nothing is gonna happen I'll be prepared

5045.4 --> 5048.839999999999
even if nothing happens

5050.8 --> 5056.5
right

5053.26 --> 5058.3
I wouldn't be so flaunting about

5056.5 --> 5060.699
eternity

5058.3 --> 5064.3
because you don't know

5060.699 --> 5067.659
it could be nothing it could be eternity

5064.3 --> 5072.06
it would be logical

5067.659 --> 5072.0599999999995
to prepare for both outcomes

5077.56 --> 5083.1990000000005
Purgatory is an Incredible Gift of Mercy

5080.679 --> 5086.14
yeah but maybe it's also just a logical

5083.199 --> 5091.678999999999
mechanism to be able to move on

5086.14 --> 5091.679
right if Purgatory or Hell to the wicked

5091.9 --> 5099.339999999999
is there then it is really there to

5095.86 --> 5100.54
cleanse the earthliness of the

5099.34 --> 5103.360000000001
spirit

5100.54 --> 5107.44
the leftover spirit so that it can

5103.36 --> 5111.5199999999995
transition in this perceived

5107.44 --> 5114.58
new realm new form not Physical Realm

5111.52 --> 5117.06
the non-physical realm or Heaven closer

5114.58 --> 5117.0599999999995
to God

5120.219 --> 5125.199
it would be like

5121.92 --> 5127.3
it will be yeah it's like oh I'm going

5125.199 --> 5129.599999999999
into the bio lab okay let's go through

5127.3 --> 5129.6
the room

5130.12 --> 5136.44
okay I'm clean now that that's Purgatory

5132.82 --> 5136.44
it's just cleaning off the [ __ ]

5137.38 --> 5143.08
right and then it's like

5140.219 --> 5146.199
yeah you're infected yeah yeah you can't

5143.08 --> 5149.04
clean up the [ __ ] now

5146.199 --> 5149.04
you're in hell

5156.82 --> 5163.9
Pascal's wager right so that's funny so

5160.719 --> 5167.26
there is yeah of course there is

5163.9 --> 5169.299999999999
there is a philosophical reference

5167.26 --> 5170.92
to what I just described and apparently

5169.3 --> 5171.9400000000005
it's called Pascal's wager I'm not

5170.92 --> 5176.08
surprised

5171.94 --> 5178.54
I mean people don't just do nothing for

5176.08 --> 5182.32
decades long they do actually

5178.54 --> 5184.239
think about things like I do

5182.32 --> 5186.699
it's not like the first

5184.239 --> 5188.08
I'm not the first person to partner upon

5186.699 --> 5190.54
these things

5188.08 --> 5192.659
but I do though I do Ponder upon these

5190.54 --> 5192.659
things

5193.54 --> 5198.34
and I also realized that a lot of

5195.639 --> 5201.400000000001
metaphysics from the past has simply

5198.34 --> 5205.179
been completely misunderstood

5201.4 --> 5208.179
because real interesting metaphysical

5205.179 --> 5211.62
data often has multiple tear

5208.179 --> 5211.62
Consciousness implications

5213.82 --> 5220.42
yeah real fractal information has

5217.6 --> 5222.88
multiple tier implications that means

5220.42 --> 5226.12
that different consciousness

5222.88 --> 5229.42
who have different things to bite down

5226.12 --> 5232.8
on concerning it depending on where with

5229.42 --> 5232.8
their Consciousness they are

5233.139 --> 5239.86
so the real wisdom

5236.62 --> 5243.159
might be universally accepted or taken

5239.86 --> 5246.719
or even written down as like this this

5243.159 --> 5250.599999999999
is how we interpret that but

5246.719 --> 5253.42
refined details that were not in

5250.6 --> 5255.46
alignment with that interpretation might

5253.42 --> 5258.46
simply be lost

5255.46 --> 5261.1
because it was not prioritized in the

5258.46 --> 5263.199
current day thinking when that happened

5261.1 --> 5265.179
well when you look at it way later

5263.199 --> 5266.919999999999
centuries later you read back about it

5265.179 --> 5269.4400000000005
then you think like that inside you

5266.92 --> 5271.06
don't have those per day priorities like

5269.44 --> 5273.219
oh this is how we're gonna look at it

5271.06 --> 5274.780000000001
because this political situation is

5273.219 --> 5276.4
happening right now no you could just

5274.78 --> 5278.38
look at it clearly without any

5276.4 --> 5279.879999999999
reservation

5278.38 --> 5282.28
on any

5279.88 --> 5284.9800000000005
urge urgency

5282.28 --> 5288.219
and then suddenly see those

5284.98 --> 5289.959999999999
other left over implications that were

5288.219 --> 5292.179
ignored

5289.96 --> 5294.82
and I feel that this is kind of what I'm

5292.179 --> 5298.54
doing right now

5294.82 --> 5300.699
when regarding the Flames of hell

5298.54 --> 5303.5199999999995
because I do think that the Catholics

5300.699 --> 5307.0
were on to something

5303.52 --> 5308.860000000001
like the actual priests that that tried

5307.0 --> 5310.78
to figure it out I don't mean like the

5308.86 --> 5313.48
pope or something I mean he's just

5310.78 --> 5316.0
freaking Antichrist probably always was

5313.48 --> 5318.759999999999
kinda

5316.0 --> 5322.02
that the whole church is the Antichrist

5318.76 --> 5325.659000000001
as a thing it's opposes Christ's

5322.02 --> 5328.06
recommendations teachings

5325.659 --> 5329.199
but people within it there are plenty of

5328.06 --> 5331.4800000000005
Catholics

5329.199 --> 5333.5199999999995
it wouldn't work without it

5331.48 --> 5335.919999999999
like Catholic Church could never have

5333.52 --> 5340.659000000001
lasted as long if like at least half of

5335.92 --> 5343.179
it wasn't actually good Christians

5340.659 --> 5345.5199999999995
because it would collapse in on itself

5343.179 --> 5347.92
it's the good Christians within the

5345.52 --> 5350.88
Catholic church that have kept it alive

5347.92 --> 5350.88
for so long

5351.159 --> 5355.42
because the evil ones yeah they make

5353.86 --> 5358.48
their moves they make their do their

5355.42 --> 5361.6
power thing but they also die out

5358.48 --> 5363.82
they get discovered and then

5361.6 --> 5366.179
pull all kinds of [ __ ] with them into

5363.82 --> 5366.179
hell

5367.659 --> 5374.92
right so the Catholic Church as a entity

5372.699 --> 5377.739
is evil

5374.92 --> 5379.659
but there's been many people within that

5377.739 --> 5383.44
Beast system

5379.659 --> 5386.0199999999995
that have done very good things and have

5383.44 --> 5389.28
had very interesting metaphysical

5386.02 --> 5389.280000000001
spiritual insights

5390.52 --> 5394.84
and I think that like demonology and the

5393.28 --> 5398.199
conception of hell

5394.84 --> 5401.32
have been one of their projects of

5398.199 --> 5403.9
research it's like pre-psychology

5401.32 --> 5407.92
research

5403.9 --> 5411.28
and it is valid there is valid

5407.92 --> 5414.34
information there spiritual insights

5411.28 --> 5416.5199999999995
it's just how people interpreted all of

5414.34 --> 5416.52
this

5416.56 --> 5424.080000000001
What story did they make with the

5420.52 --> 5427.6
metaphysical lore they discovered

5424.08 --> 5430.179
eventually to manipulate and boo the

5427.6 --> 5431.139
public to force them to obey and give

5430.179 --> 5433.96
them money

5431.139 --> 5436.84
and do what they say

5433.96 --> 5439.4800000000005
right so they eventually are just abused

5436.84 --> 5441.34
this very valuable knowledge that was

5439.48 --> 5443.919999999999
being dug up

5441.34 --> 5446.7390000000005
they just abused it for mind control

5443.92 --> 5448.12
over the people which is terrible but

5446.739 --> 5451.54
that doesn't mean that the original

5448.12 --> 5454.38
research and insights were invalid or

5451.54 --> 5454.38
just made up

5454.78 --> 5461.32
so now I am digging through that

5458.02 --> 5464.92
through that myth to physical material

5461.32 --> 5467.08
making reconsiderations like bottom up

5464.92 --> 5469.36
reconsideration

5467.08 --> 5471.58
what is this what did they really mean

5469.36 --> 5473.259999999999
what is there to it

5471.58 --> 5476.4
How can I

5473.26 --> 5480.76
compare this to my own

5476.4 --> 5485.08
Grassroots ideas like of the elements

5480.76 --> 5487.900000000001
right fire Consciousness water soul

5485.08 --> 5489.34
Earth body

5487.9 --> 5492.299999999999
uh

5489.34 --> 5492.3
I miss

5494.02 --> 5500.88
yeah and Earth uh air Spirit of course

5496.659 --> 5504.48
fire Consciousness water Soul Earth body

5500.88 --> 5504.4800000000005
air spirit

5509.739 --> 5514.08
it's on my symbolic site by the way it's

5512.26 --> 5515.8
from like 2008.

5514.08 --> 5518.62
[Music]

5515.8 --> 5520.4800000000005
so definitely real

5518.62 --> 5522.5199999999995
I always like to remind everybody about

5520.48 --> 5524.44
that like yeah no I didn't just make

5522.52 --> 5528.84
this up yesterday

5524.44 --> 5528.839999999999
this has been around for a long time

5538.8 --> 5544.02
last updated 2008 ha called it

5544.179 --> 5548.219
July 11 2008

5561.46 --> 5566.08
Vatican has always been yes Kevin K

5564.159 --> 5569.08
that's what I'm saying

5566.08 --> 5571.54
I think that the Catholic church is like

5569.08 --> 5575.38
the the Antichrist and I think that even

5571.54 --> 5578.0199999999995
within the Bible it's already there

5575.38 --> 5581.02
like Paul Saul

5578.02 --> 5584.92
was actually the first Antichrist

5581.02 --> 5588.040000000001
and we actually have the Antichrist

5584.92 --> 5591.46
Bible in that sense which is

5588.04 --> 5593.739
still with the Christ still in there is

5591.46 --> 5595.4800000000005
just being captured

5593.739 --> 5597.339999999999
that's what I've been trying to say for

5595.48 --> 5600.178999999999
so long

5597.34 --> 5600.179
on my show

5608.08 --> 5615.46
the second I said keep us coming back

5612.219 --> 5617.9800000000005
well it's we want some of that Spirit of

5615.46 --> 5618.94
Christ don't we Kevin K because that's

5617.98 --> 5621.28
real

5618.94 --> 5623.259999999999
the issue though is that the spirit of

5621.28 --> 5625.179
Christ you don't need to go to a church

5623.26 --> 5629.08
to drink that

5625.179 --> 5631.78
right there the spirit of Christ the

5629.08 --> 5633.94
Holy Ghost right as he's usually known

5631.78 --> 5636.4
it

5633.94 --> 5639.699
it's right there

5636.4 --> 5643.179
it's like the electric ether

5639.699 --> 5645.879999999999
and as a spirit you can just

5643.179 --> 5647.62
you can just tap into it

5645.88 --> 5651.9400000000005
it's right there

5647.62 --> 5655.0599999999995
When you pray you interface with it

5651.94 --> 5657.239
when you feel deeply you interface with

5655.06 --> 5657.2390000000005
it

5657.28 --> 5663.4
I mean you don't need a church I mean a

5660.52 --> 5667.120000000001
church might remind you of it the church

5663.4 --> 5670.0
might like create that happening so that

5667.12 --> 5672.5199999999995
you can like be pulled along with it but

5670.0 --> 5675.82
you don't need a church to invoke it the

5672.52 --> 5677.9800000000005
spirit of Christ the Holy Ghost

5675.82 --> 5680.08
is always there

5677.98 --> 5682.599999999999
it's everywhere it's like The Ether

5680.08 --> 5684.4
except it is actually there it's not

5682.6 --> 5687.6
conceptually there

5684.4 --> 5687.599999999999
[Music]

5698.679 --> 5700.92
foreign

5702.54 --> 5705.639
than to do

5704.5 --> 5709.92
good

5705.639 --> 5709.92
and act like it out of fear

5710.679 --> 5716.8
yeah of course it's better to actually

5713.199 --> 5718.96
be a good person but if you're not

5716.8 --> 5721.42
well

5718.96 --> 5723.219
would you rather have the wicked person

5721.42 --> 5726.58
acting Wicked

5723.219 --> 5730.139
or trying to contain his wickedness

5726.58 --> 5730.139
it's kind of a weird question there

5732.159 --> 5737.5
I mean if somebody is wicked it's not

5734.679 --> 5741.06
like oh well what if they just chose to

5737.5 --> 5741.06
be good yeah that's the point

5742.96 --> 5747.719
Wicked don't choose to be good they

5745.3 --> 5747.719
never do

5748.62 --> 5751.8189999999995
[Music]

5775.179 --> 5778.179
anyway

5779.62 --> 5781.8
foreign

5782.739 --> 5788.0199999999995
20 more minutes

5785.5 --> 5790.26
it's been a great show at least I think

5788.02 --> 5790.26
so

5827.39 --> 5830.619000000001
[Music]

5848.38 --> 5853.62
so you got any conclusion to that

5850.6 --> 5853.620000000001
logical conclusion

5855.76 --> 5859.360000000001
first this the moment again where you

5857.5 --> 5862.08
all just shut up for 10 minutes straight

5859.36 --> 5862.08
out of nowhere

5872.08 --> 5876.59
it's all fascinating

5874.6 --> 5879.77
okay

5876.59 --> 5879.77
[Music]

5894.74 --> 5898.01
[Music]

5898.659 --> 5901.44
weird

5910.0 --> 5915.1
I don't understand that though what do

5911.98 --> 5917.5199999999995
you mean bloodless sacrifice

5915.1 --> 5917.52
what

5917.78 --> 5920.938999999999
[Music]

5925.42 --> 5928.42
foreign

5934.8 --> 5940.179
[Music]

5937.84 --> 5943.179
all right yeah

5940.179 --> 5945.46
that stuff drinking the blood and eating

5943.179 --> 5947.9800000000005
the Flesh of Christ

5945.46 --> 5951.19
yeah I think that

5947.98 --> 5951.19
[Music]

5955.719 --> 5960.54
I don't do that I think it's bizarre

5963.1 --> 5968.860000000001
it's it's even like illogical in a way

5966.88 --> 5972.46
because Christ

5968.86 --> 5975.219
yeah because first of the of that

5972.46 --> 5977.44
there is an antecedent factor of

5975.219 --> 5981.4
sacrifice in it

5977.44 --> 5984.4
so by that logic there is an antecedent

5981.4 --> 5987.339999999999
of God designed the world in which you

5984.4 --> 5990.0599999999995
have to sacrifice things

5987.34 --> 5990.06
for him

5990.159 --> 5996.04
I don't believe that I just don't and I

5994.0 --> 5997.78
don't think that Christ believed it

5996.04 --> 6000.54
either

5997.78 --> 6004.08
and he tried to stop it

6000.54 --> 6006.36
but he could only stop it by addressing

6004.08 --> 6008.639
what was there he couldn't just say like

6006.36 --> 6010.5
no that's just a lie it would nobody

6008.639 --> 6012.92
would listen because it's been like that

6010.5 --> 6012.92
forever

6020.58 --> 6024.659
but it's then pretty like it's

6022.86 --> 6027.36
reaffirming

6024.659 --> 6031.0199999999995
of what Christ tried to stop by

6027.36 --> 6033.659
literally remembering him

6031.02 --> 6037.860000000001
by emulating

6033.659 --> 6041.638999999999
a sacrifice with with the words even

6037.86 --> 6044.54
blood and flesh which is really bizarre

6041.639 --> 6049.46
because I'm pretty damn sure that Christ

6044.54 --> 6053.1
specifically wanted to stop that not to

6049.46 --> 6054.84
be the last person to be sacrificed so

6053.1 --> 6057.84
that it would

6054.84 --> 6060.12
like be remembered over and over like

6057.84 --> 6063.900000000001
like you would be tricking God like oh

6060.12 --> 6066.179
no we don't really set we're sacrificing

6063.9 --> 6069.32
the spirit of Christ here okay God is

6066.179 --> 6073.8
that good it's again

6069.32 --> 6075.179
default assuming that God designed this

6073.8 --> 6078.900000000001
world

6075.179 --> 6083.6990000000005
and that in this world per default you

6078.9 --> 6087.299999999999
need to blood sacrifice it's insane

6083.699 --> 6089.879999999999
and [ __ ] illogical

6087.3 --> 6091.88
it's ridiculous

6089.88 --> 6095.84
it's blatantly

6091.88 --> 6095.84
unspiritual and archaic

6097.5 --> 6105.42
like that is actually archaic yeah

6101.04 --> 6108.42
blood sacrifice is archaic it's archaic

6105.42 --> 6111.78
it's evil it's archaic there is no

6108.42 --> 6114.6
constructive thing

6111.78 --> 6116.759999999999
that comes from it except for like

6114.6 --> 6118.5
vampiric dependency if you're gonna

6116.76 --> 6121.04
consume it

6118.5 --> 6121.04
whatever

6125.4 --> 6129.96
right and you could argue that like

6127.26 --> 6132.42
eating meat is already kind of that and

6129.96 --> 6134.4
yeah it does enhance our life and those

6132.42 --> 6136.58
expand it in our intelligence and all

6134.4 --> 6136.58
that

6136.98 --> 6144.239
but to say You must do that for God or

6141.0 --> 6145.8
he will punish you after death is really

6144.239 --> 6149.0599999999995
bizarre

6145.8 --> 6149.06
and illogical

6151.02 --> 6156.360000000001
so I believe that Jesus actually tried

6154.5 --> 6160.639
to stop

6156.36 --> 6160.639
that ridiculous superstition

6160.739 --> 6165.86
that was ingrained within the alleged

6163.619 --> 6168.96
her religion he grew up in between

6165.86 --> 6171.839999999999
Judaism according to the Bible I don't

6168.96 --> 6174.42
even think that's real by the way but

6171.84 --> 6176.88
whatever going with the story that's

6174.42 --> 6180.4800000000005
what supposedly happened that's what he

6176.88 --> 6182.76
was in and I think he just tried to make

6180.48 --> 6184.619
it stop but you can't just say yeah I

6182.76 --> 6186.54
don't believe that's real

6184.619 --> 6189.42
because then you'd like just break with

6186.54 --> 6192.48
the tradition entirely you like they

6189.42 --> 6193.92
would have not accepted it

6192.48 --> 6196.199
I think

6193.92 --> 6198.96
so that's why he tried to like present

6196.199 --> 6200.94
it in a more fulfilling way like oh man

6198.96 --> 6203.1
I got a really important message we

6200.94 --> 6205.379999999999
really don't have to do this anymore

6203.1 --> 6207.4800000000005
right I'm not saying like stop doing

6205.38 --> 6209.400000000001
this you idiots this is wrong this is

6207.48 --> 6210.9
always wrong

6209.4 --> 6212.759999999999
because then he would have been like

6210.9 --> 6215.759999999999
yeah

6212.76 --> 6217.679
like the god of the Old Testament yeah

6215.76 --> 6219.84
that's all [ __ ] that's basically

6217.679 --> 6222.179
what he would have to had said that's

6219.84 --> 6225.6
what he would have to say then and

6222.179 --> 6229.02
that's not gonna yeah that wouldn't work

6225.6 --> 6233.06
so logically he figured out okay

6229.02 --> 6235.4400000000005
it's fulfilled we can stop doing it now

6233.06 --> 6237.84
[Music]

6235.44 --> 6241.099999999999
and that way it was palatable that way

6237.84 --> 6241.1
was acceptable

6241.139 --> 6244.219
they would go with it

6244.8 --> 6250.38
but I still find it bizarre that

6247.98 --> 6253.32
that he's remembered for the thing that

6250.38 --> 6255.4800000000005
he actually tried to stop

6253.32 --> 6259.639
like that's how you're remembering him

6255.48 --> 6259.638999999999
through the Eucharist really weird

6266.04 --> 6269.6
it's what he said

6269.76 --> 6273.679
why don't you just type it up

6280.5 --> 6285.96
you mean that Jesus told his followers

6283.199 --> 6288.98
to do that to remember him

6285.96 --> 6288.9800000000005
I remember that

6304.98 --> 6307.638999999999
foreign

6331.04 --> 6335.119
yeah it's metaphysically

6337.199 --> 6343.44
it's like think of eating me like think

6340.46 --> 6346.58
of like taking that magnificent power

6343.44 --> 6346.58
and consuming it

6346.619 --> 6351.32
so it's like

6348.719 --> 6353.52
here's a trick how you could imagine

6351.32 --> 6355.799999999999
taking it in

6353.52 --> 6357.900000000001
because people probably would have

6355.8 --> 6360.96
experience like eating beef and then

6357.9 --> 6362.219
like immediately feel like Oh I Feel It

6360.96 --> 6364.52
In Me Right

6362.219 --> 6369.42
so they would know like yeah

6364.52 --> 6371.639
you get some of its power by eating it

6369.42 --> 6373.26
or by that logic it's like yeah if you

6371.639 --> 6375.96
eat

6373.26 --> 6377.1
yeah what what is even now thought of is

6375.96 --> 6379.5
like

6377.1 --> 6381.2390000000005
third world country people like they eat

6379.5 --> 6383.1
their enemies like they eat their

6381.239 --> 6385.32
enemies hard because they are so such a

6383.1 --> 6387.780000000001
tenacious enemy or they eat their brain

6385.32 --> 6390.119
because they were really smart it's kind

6387.78 --> 6393.36
of that sort of thinking it's like oh

6390.119 --> 6396.599999999999
I'm super enlightened you guys all want

6393.36 --> 6399.5599999999995
that power well just imagine as if you

6396.6 --> 6399.56
took a bite of me

6399.6 --> 6405.08
and then just like you would eat that

6401.58 --> 6405.08
beef of that super strong

6405.239 --> 6412.199
Bull and feel super strong for it so can

6409.08 --> 6415.94
you imagine taking a bite of me or my

6412.199 --> 6415.94
spirit and then getting that power

6417.36 --> 6420.32
wouldn't you say

6442.32 --> 6446.219
and get the rituals they do well I think

6445.26 --> 6449.34
that

6446.219 --> 6451.38
to be fair I think that in those times

6449.34 --> 6453.179
which would have been roughly Medieval

6451.38 --> 6455.46
Times which is probably when Christ

6453.179 --> 6457.02
really existed and not a thousand years

6455.46 --> 6458.52
before that because there was no

6457.02 --> 6460.9800000000005
thousand years before that because it

6458.52 --> 6463.619000000001
was invented by a Roman Emperor

6460.98 --> 6465.0599999999995
literally crammed in in between

6463.619 --> 6467.78
everything

6465.06 --> 6467.780000000001
Thousand Years

6468.06 --> 6475.619000000001
I think that people back then actually

6470.46 --> 6479.28
did like ritual consumption

6475.619 --> 6481.44
that they ate their beloved dead I know

6479.28 --> 6483.119
that sounds really [ __ ] up right

6481.44 --> 6484.5
but that they believed that they could

6483.119 --> 6486.42
take

6484.5 --> 6489.84
a bit of their spirit

6486.42 --> 6491.58
with them by consuming them

6489.84 --> 6494.28
and the funny thing is is that there's

6491.58 --> 6495.54
something to that because

6494.28 --> 6497.28
if

6495.54 --> 6499.86
recommend this but I mean some people

6497.28 --> 6502.86
they have people have testified plenty

6499.86 --> 6507.0
that is if you like

6502.86 --> 6509.699
kill a a wild animal or a cow

6507.0 --> 6511.32
right you have to shoot it there

6509.699 --> 6513.0
and like

6511.32 --> 6515.28
basically

6513.0 --> 6518.1
very quickly within like an hour or

6515.28 --> 6520.98
something cut out the heart

6518.1 --> 6522.360000000001
or some other organ and you take a bite

6520.98 --> 6524.339999999999
out of that

6522.36 --> 6526.08
or you drink some of its blood when it's

6524.34 --> 6529.56
still very fresh

6526.08 --> 6530.76
you get dreams you get dreams of the

6529.56 --> 6533.219
creature

6530.76 --> 6535.4400000000005
from first perspective

6533.219 --> 6536.34
like you get to experience some of their

6535.44 --> 6539.099999999999
life

6536.34 --> 6543.2390000000005
and I think that that effect

6539.1 --> 6546.96
is what was actually aimed for

6543.239 --> 6550.98
people that want it to be

6546.96 --> 6553.32
able to experience that sinlessness

6550.98 --> 6557.159
like Perfection they wanted a piece of

6553.32 --> 6560.88
God of the sensation of being pure and

6557.159 --> 6560.879999999999
like that right

6562.02 --> 6565.56
and I think that that's actually what

6564.0 --> 6567.42
it's referencing

6565.56 --> 6569.639
that effect

6567.42 --> 6571.86
like eat a piece of me and then

6569.639 --> 6573.84
experience me

6571.86 --> 6575.58
and I think because I think that that's

6573.84 --> 6578.2390000000005
what they did back then I think that

6575.58 --> 6578.239
even like

6578.34 --> 6584.219
yeah like folk Heroes

6582.179 --> 6586.26
like in medieval think Medieval Times

6584.219 --> 6590.28
the folk Heroes

6586.26 --> 6592.6990000000005
and like Saints perhaps even

6590.28 --> 6596.599999999999
that they would be

6592.699 --> 6596.599999999999
consumed after their death

6596.94 --> 6602.28
like they died oh

6599.82 --> 6603.96
we need a piece of that that person's so

6602.28 --> 6604.98
great we can't just throw them in the

6603.96 --> 6607.38
dirt

6604.98 --> 6609.0599999999995
we gotta like assimilate as much of it

6607.38 --> 6611.659000000001
as possible we got to drink their blood

6609.06 --> 6611.659000000001
right

6612.36 --> 6619.5
that it's well known guys like even up

6616.92 --> 6621.679
into the Renaissance Era

6619.5 --> 6624.179
that if like

6621.679 --> 6627.42
nobilities got it right they have

6624.179 --> 6630.06
nobilities like the king or the queen

6627.42 --> 6631.7390000000005
certainly gets executed by the new king

6630.06 --> 6634.679
or queen right that sort of thing

6631.739 --> 6636.419999999999
happens or some family they put them

6634.679 --> 6639.3
over they chop their head off in public

6636.42 --> 6641.4
and then everybody would start grossly

6639.3 --> 6643.7390000000005
collecting the blood

6641.4 --> 6646.259999999999
of the beheading in bowls

6643.739 --> 6649.5599999999995
why the [ __ ] would they do that

6646.26 --> 6651.54
right well they did it for literally for

6649.56 --> 6653.219
the chemical of the chemical blood

6651.54 --> 6656.159
because you can do things with it

6653.219 --> 6658.5
chemically and all that and useful for

6656.159 --> 6660.9
all kinds of things they were there's

6658.5 --> 6662.1
all kinds of use for organic materials

6660.9 --> 6664.32
like that

6662.1 --> 6665.9400000000005
but I think it's also because they just

6664.32 --> 6667.92
collected the blood because they wanted

6665.94 --> 6669.9
some of that experience

6667.92 --> 6671.82
because I think that was a lot more

6669.9 --> 6673.799999999999
common back then

6671.82 --> 6675.54
in medieval times I think it was quite

6673.8 --> 6679.08
common that people

6675.54 --> 6680.94
drank blood and ate flesh of their

6679.08 --> 6685.26
deceased

6680.94 --> 6687.599999999999
I think that was more normal back then

6685.26 --> 6691.9800000000005
and I think that that is part of the

6687.6 --> 6694.38
reason why it's such a thing

6691.98 --> 6698.159
with Christ

6694.38 --> 6699.96
he probably came around in the peak of

6698.159 --> 6703.759999999999
that entire thing

6699.96 --> 6703.76
when it was at its most popular

6705.06 --> 6710.400000000001
see this is how I think about things

6708.93 --> 6712.26
[Music]

6710.4 --> 6714.839999999999
this is how you dig up the real

6712.26 --> 6716.46
interesting gems because everybody just

6714.84 --> 6718.02
shaves over it they think they already

6716.46 --> 6722.219
got what they were looking for and then

6718.02 --> 6723.01
they just they don't try I try I do go

6722.219 --> 6725.28
those places

6723.01 --> 6727.4400000000005
[Music]

6725.28 --> 6731.219
and that's why you come to my channel

6727.44 --> 6733.08
and watch my show for to witness that

6731.219 --> 6735.96
kind of process because you don't find

6733.08 --> 6738.199
that anywhere else

6735.96 --> 6738.199
foreign

6743.28 --> 6748.44
still Yes more color

6746.28 --> 6752.659
after death yeah yeah don't eat them

6748.44 --> 6752.659
alive that's [ __ ] but yes

6753.36 --> 6757.0199999999995
by the way it is an interesting

6755.28 --> 6759.5599999999995
conception

6757.02 --> 6763.56
although it is a very dark conception

6759.56 --> 6766.02
but I do Wonder uh but I don't ever want

6763.56 --> 6769.02
to experience for the record let that be

6766.02 --> 6771.8
clear I do wonder that would you be able

6769.02 --> 6774.540000000001
to experience

6771.8 --> 6776.9400000000005
somebody's experience right like eating

6774.54 --> 6779.699
the Flesh of the of a

6776.94 --> 6781.44
or the Beating Heart of an animal

6779.699 --> 6784.199
that you just killed and then you get

6781.44 --> 6785.58
the dreams would you be able to get the

6784.199 --> 6787.799999999999
dream

6785.58 --> 6790.32
of the flesh

6787.8 --> 6793.139
of something or somebody that's still

6790.32 --> 6796.199
alive would you still be able to just by

6793.139 --> 6798.36
eating a chunk of their flesh that isn't

6796.199 --> 6800.4
vital for their survival or drinking a

6798.36 --> 6803.58
huge amount of blood would you literally

6800.4 --> 6805.379999999999
experience their conscious perspective

6803.58 --> 6808.08
experience type vision

6805.38 --> 6810.719
or does that only work because they're

6808.08 --> 6812.639
dead because they're not actually there

6810.719 --> 6815.1
anymore I don't know

6812.639 --> 6817.28
and to be fair I don't really want to

6815.1 --> 6817.280000000001
know

6823.66 --> 6826.729
[Music]

6828.84 --> 6833.84
yeah what the [ __ ] it's our time

6842.4 --> 6848.94
oh granddad's going to jail for

6845.4 --> 6851.28
obstruction traffic obstruction okay

6848.94 --> 6855.138999999999
I don't care good

6851.28 --> 6858.84
I mean all those freaking idiots

6855.139 --> 6861.06
others climate change numpties

6858.84 --> 6863.6990000000005
traffic obstructionist they should be

6861.06 --> 6865.8
put in jail they should be put in jail

6863.699 --> 6868.619
just like

6865.8 --> 6871.28
like people that get drunk in public

6868.619 --> 6874.32
I mean those crazy

6871.28 --> 6876.119
environmentalist freaks are pretty much

6874.32 --> 6878.5199999999995
like people getting drunk in public

6876.119 --> 6881.159
they're just about as stupid and

6878.52 --> 6883.5
annoying they're just about as much of a

6881.159 --> 6886.08
nuisance and they're just as stupid and

6883.5 --> 6888.5
so you should do the same thing put them

6886.08 --> 6888.5
in jail

6888.659 --> 6893.099999999999
and then tell them don't do that again

6891.179 --> 6894.9
or the next time you'll be put in jail

6893.1 --> 6897.06
longer

6894.9 --> 6900.0
right so that would be the best

6897.06 --> 6903.719
treatment yeah just treat those

6900.0 --> 6906.0
climate crazies cultists

6903.719 --> 6908.699
traffic obstructionist just treat them

6906.0 --> 6910.26
like people that are getting drunk in

6908.699 --> 6912.299999999999
public

6910.26 --> 6914.52
because they're pretty much on the same

6912.3 --> 6917.360000000001
level they're very stupid they have no

6914.52 --> 6917.360000000001
idea what they're doing

6917.52 --> 6920.84
and they're in the way

6921.42 --> 6925.7390000000005
and basically doing things that are

6923.28 --> 6928.0199999999995
illegal I mean being drunk in public is

6925.739 --> 6930.48
technically illegal obstructing traffic

6928.02 --> 6933.06
is technically illegal

6930.48 --> 6935.28
