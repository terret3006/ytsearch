[Music]

35.79 --> 37.85
you

39.309 --> 46.43
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

42.5 --> 48.26
earlybird number 336 I'm your host

46.43 --> 50.93
Arwen and before I start to show please

48.26 --> 51.86
don't forget to share it and he platform

50.93 --> 54.5
you deem fit

51.86 --> 56.12
and if you haven't already subscribed to

54.5 --> 57.649
my channel and hit the bell notification

56.12 --> 59.93
so you know when I'm going live which is

57.649 --> 62.72
normally 2:00 p.m. amsterdam time every

59.93 --> 64.79
day and please also do support my show

62.72 --> 66.8
through super chats paypal patreon my

64.79 --> 71.17
GoFundMe that will be much appreciated

66.8 --> 74.479
so yeah little hiccup there in the video

71.17 --> 81.19
you rearrange some things that make some

74.479 --> 93.009
space but should put that back anyway

81.19 --> 93.009
yeah morning it's a crowd

94.659 --> 102.43
anyway the weather is kind of grayish

96.9 --> 109.39
not rainy but still yeah it is kind of

102.43 --> 112.47
cold and wind still and yeah it is

109.39 --> 112.47
blueberry George

116.0 --> 123.56
there's a lot of seagulls going around

118.03 --> 129.32
also they're probably just scouring due

123.56 --> 133.18
to the growing lack of food because of

129.32 --> 137.53
the end of this summer season anyway

133.18 --> 137.53
yeah let's see who isn't jet

141.38 --> 151.10999999999999
drunken bullet for one one was first my

145.47 --> 156.09
core work I am a man a young George

151.11 --> 162.41000000000003
Sanford mother Saleem Michael O'Rourke

studio 68 save Jaco 101 rockhound

175.36 --> 179.76000000000002
yeah good to see you all

180.79 --> 188.04
I'm not gonna call it crow Jose no way

184.409 --> 188.04
it's not gonna happen

191.88 --> 202.29
[Music]

193.27 --> 210.55
oh really look got more trolls good more

202.29 --> 212.35
yeah they do keep me busy don't they so

210.55 --> 215.65
they keep coming back for more I should

212.35 --> 222.07
have expected that but on the other hand

215.65 --> 224.74
ya know I don't have a lot of direct

222.07 --> 226.75
flattered two related things that I'm

224.74 --> 230.62
occupying myself with other than the

226.75 --> 233.23
debates and noticing the the clip being

230.62 --> 235.69
taken out of my relative density versus

233.23 --> 238.75
gravity explanation and yeah I was

235.69 --> 240.57999999999998
satisfied to hear that back the sound

238.75 --> 242.89
quality in that particular recording

240.58 --> 245.26000000000002
wasn't all that great but still good to

242.89 --> 247.55999999999997
hear it back and yeah I'm kind of proud

245.26 --> 247.56
of it

252.23 --> 263.34999999999997
it's Erin Armstrong isn't it I think it

257.72 --> 263.35
is just look at the name

267.23 --> 275.56
this whole airforce type related so yeah

276.61 --> 280.05
Oh What did he say

282.82 --> 286.77
okay yeah

288.12 --> 294.45
there are open declarations of basically

290.76 --> 303.389
breaking the rules is a banner bow

294.45 --> 306.51
offense Oh Oh side chat then yes I

303.389 --> 311.73
hadn't came by yesterday it was funny

306.51 --> 317.73
Nathan like basically when Adam straight

311.73 --> 320.88
from the chat and it was good also yeah

317.73 --> 323.94
earlier just this I just wanted to show

320.88 --> 327.06
everyone what happens when true what

323.94 --> 329.49
trolls really are like when you're just

327.06 --> 335.01
completely fearless and just honest

329.49 --> 336.6
about everything and also yeah that just

335.01 --> 343.11
to show off a bit that I can do it

336.6 --> 349.35
without causing any damage so that's

343.11 --> 351.41900000000004
what what happens and I'll do it voice

349.35 --> 353.78900000000004
the voice as well I don't know if I

351.419 --> 357.78
could do it face to face it's kind of

353.789 --> 361.46
different like that but because yeah I

357.78 --> 367.90999999999997
am kind of a modest person in nature and

361.46 --> 371.19
to be very on the spot face to face is

367.91 --> 373.16900000000004
difficult because yeah you know what

371.19 --> 375.15
happens you know what happens over here

373.169 --> 377.27
people go nuts so if you do that face to

375.15 --> 380.37
face they may go nuts on you as well

377.27 --> 381.24
you don't yeah you don't know them well

380.37 --> 384.78000000000003
enough

381.24 --> 387.419
like I'd need to know people and be

384.78 --> 390.479
confident about how they hold themselves

387.419 --> 394.43
up in order to engage them in an actual

390.479 --> 396.539
face-to-face type of debate thing

394.43 --> 399.95
because it's very different when the

396.539 --> 403.169
Internet's in between you even though I

399.95 --> 406.37
do it on screen and with voice and

403.169 --> 414.5
everything life it's still different

406.37 --> 417.38
anyway oh right yeah the simondon issue

414.5 --> 420.65
and the aaron armstrong troll trying to

417.38 --> 422.93
ask me questions offering money for it

420.65 --> 425.62
but of course not pay and ending up

422.93 --> 427.49
paying it of course as I predicted that

425.62 --> 436.79
happened on the early bird show

427.49 --> 441.74
yesterday yeah I kindly left out a title

436.79 --> 445.55
I know because Simon and what he wants

441.74 --> 449.33
primarily to be seen and yeah he really

445.55 --> 453.2
tried to make it his hangout so I'm not

449.33 --> 458.69
gonna put my name or his name in the

453.2 --> 462.40999999999997
Hangout title because yeah it's not that

458.69 --> 465.71
special when he does that it's just like

462.41 --> 468.32000000000005
any other troll except he is probably

465.71 --> 470.45
even more miserable because he does have

468.32 --> 473.65999999999997
a channel and he really is to cowardice

470.45 --> 478.45
to come on life with somebody

473.66 --> 478.45000000000005
it's really sad anyway

485.669 --> 490.58
yeah Darkstar can go screw himself I

491.509 --> 498.03000000000003
remember Darkstar from way back like

495.599 --> 503.4
he's been a true a chat troll for at

498.03 --> 507.61999999999995
least three years and he's a very creepy

503.4 --> 507.62
dude I really don't like him at all

519.659 --> 526.48
what are you talking about what is this

522.61 --> 529.35
wind in space I all heard about the

526.48 --> 529.35
bubbles in space

539.76 --> 542.449
yeah

545.089 --> 551.879
come on 101 rockhound

547.35 --> 554.549
I can even answer the question now

551.879 --> 557.389
that's supposedly working that's pre

554.549 --> 557.389
supposed to work

562.15 --> 573.06
the whole idea of drifting in space is

565.839 --> 576.4000000000001
based on is it angular momentum just the

573.06 --> 578.0799999999999
no gravity and neutralization of density

576.4 --> 580.42
buoyancy however you want to see the

578.08 --> 585.97
circumstances that would be presupposed

580.42 --> 588.01
and because it is outside of there or

585.97 --> 589.69
while they say microgravity but that

588.01 --> 593.47
micro yeah they I think they're all

589.69 --> 596.83
still lined and because that

593.47 --> 599.26
microgravity is so little they may drift

596.83 --> 602.25
a little bit more because of just a

599.26 --> 605.65
momentum of the movements they've made

602.25 --> 607.3
now i'm presupposing the yeah space

605.65 --> 610.27
presupposing the [ __ ] out of these

607.3 --> 614.5889999999999
mechanics but that's how it's theorized

610.27 --> 615.52
to work so they wouldn't all just drop

614.589 --> 619.6
like a brick

615.52 --> 623.4399999999999
they have symbolic weiss like a brick

619.6 --> 626.95
closer to sea level where the gravity is

623.44 --> 629.11
stronger right supposedly be very

626.95 --> 633.279
microgravity means very little so it

629.11 --> 636.52
would pull whatever just very little bit

633.279 --> 639.91
just cause a slow drift that's the idea

636.52 --> 642.1
what they're presupposing there and well

639.91 --> 645.88
for some reason the ISS doesn't fall

642.1 --> 648.66
down in that condition because it is in

645.88 --> 652.0
a perpetual fall around the earth

648.66 --> 654.13
preventing it from falling down then

652.0 --> 657.43
that's the orbit mechanic principle that

654.13 --> 661.51
doesn't make any damn sense so yeah that

657.43 --> 663.9399999999999
is why supposedly astronauts when they

661.51 --> 669.28
take a spacewalk out of the ISS don't

663.94 --> 672.3800000000001
fall down satisfied now

669.28 --> 672.38
[Music]

677.82 --> 681.029
[Music]

687.94 --> 691.099
[Music]

693.61 --> 697.54
astrum that's okay

704.569 --> 715.05
hmm yeah I had Tamara coffee by the way

710.279 --> 719.999
I still have tea keep jumbling up my

715.05 --> 723.949
routines maybe it is because I'm

719.999 --> 727.769
unusually hungry it was kind of weird

723.949 --> 731.0999999999999
the big dinner for me laid out this

727.769 --> 733.79
evening said it's gonna be fine I'm just

731.1 --> 733.7900000000001
really hungry

733.85 --> 737.029
[Music]

743.99 --> 752.28
and yeah I had some some breakfast

750.09 --> 755.0400000000001
but just a little and I actually want to

752.28 --> 757.74
have my lunch already did even before

755.04 --> 761.5699999999999
this before I started to hang out but I

757.74 --> 767.13
got up very early I just didn't expect

761.57 --> 768.9300000000001
that I didn't go to bed that late but it

767.13 --> 774.36
wasn't really early either I just I

768.93 --> 778.8299999999999
don't know I just got jolted awake like

774.36 --> 781.02
I thought like I need to go to the

778.83 --> 785.3100000000001
bathroom or something but as soon as I

781.02 --> 788.04
basically got up I have just awoke and

785.31 --> 798.4499999999999
it was like no I'm gonna be doing stuff

788.04 --> 800.0999999999999
okay what's with hunger so I don't have

798.45 --> 802.8000000000001
a lot of supplies at the moment still

800.1 --> 807.78
waiting for a big chunk of money to come

802.8 --> 809.6099999999999
in hopefully tomorrow that would be very

807.78 --> 812.99
happy if that would be the case

809.61 --> 812.99
otherwise I'm gonna have to improvise

815.39 --> 828.72
plasmoid plasma reads all plasmids are

822.44 --> 831.12
basically magnet magnetism or a plasma

828.72 --> 835.02
subjected to magnetism and that causes

831.12 --> 837.44
the plasmoid phenomena glow I guess like

835.02 --> 837.4399999999999
a lamp

838.62 --> 848.14
like a certain type of lamp but I don't

845.71 --> 851.34
see the relevance of even the whole

848.14 --> 854.71
concept it's like this such a remote

851.34 --> 856.9300000000001
idea that that could somehow prove gas

854.71 --> 861.61
sticking to a wall when there's actually

856.93 --> 865.93
no gas is really involved not the type

861.61 --> 870.3100000000001
of gases that we can measure to be there

865.93 --> 872.3499999999999
here on earth in its setting so even if

870.31 --> 875.5899999999999
they thought that this plasmoid could be

872.35 --> 877.66
involved somehow into keeping gas stuck

875.59 --> 880.39
to a ball where's the gas in the

877.66 --> 883.54
demonstration you know if they could

880.39 --> 885.46
show now being kind of silly it's

883.54 --> 887.4399999999999
probably totally nonsense to even

885.46 --> 891.61
speculate about this but if they could

887.44 --> 895.57
show a ball with a plasmid that would

891.61 --> 901.12
surround it and in the in between the

895.57 --> 905.1400000000001
plasmoid and the ball gas that would be

901.12 --> 907.78
kept stuck in between somehow and then

905.14 --> 910.5699999999999
well well let's see just how far it can

907.78 --> 914.16
even go on in the vacuum chamber because

910.57 --> 916.3000000000001
I think it was pretty clear in the

914.16 --> 918.43
references that were brought up during

916.3 --> 923.8299999999999
the debates when this the whole thing

918.43 --> 928.65
was brought up it was a grim V that yeah

923.83 --> 932.8000000000001
it said clearly if vacuum it if the gas

928.65 --> 937.54
drops surrounding the experiments the

932.8 --> 940.03
plasmoid will evaporate so it was so no

937.54 --> 944.11
it wasn't the entire point was super

940.03 --> 947.11
moot so

944.11 --> 947.11
sit

953.87 --> 957.47
extremely low pressure

965.17 --> 967.89
the

967.98 --> 976.86
lack of pressure the the vacuum it has a

972.29 --> 981.87
presupposed bottom-line definition it

976.86 --> 985.62
has a set or an estimated amount so what

981.87 --> 992.279
is it ten to the minus thirteen Torr or

985.62 --> 994.589
whatever 17 I very low pressure and that

992.279 --> 997.079
is what it's supposed to be and there's

994.589 --> 1000.0790000000001
no evidence for this at all anywhere

997.079 --> 1003.38
can't even recreate it it's like a

1000.079 --> 1008.56
fictional amount because can't be

1003.38 --> 1008.56
achieved mechanically so

1026.22 --> 1029.819
[Music]

1040.91 --> 1047.52
now the I'm are colored taking him way

1044.88 --> 1049.23
too serious the whole freefall idea the

1047.52 --> 1052.17
concept of an orbit

1049.23 --> 1053.97
it's just they just so explain it's a

1052.17 --> 1059.9
fictional trick it's a little

1053.97 --> 1065.04
machination a suspense of disbelief it's

1059.9 --> 1068.0700000000002
warping yeah the conceptual elements so

1065.04 --> 1071.1499999999999
the idea of an orbit a perpetual fall is

1068.07 --> 1072.72
like an earlier trick in the beginning

1071.15 --> 1076.46
conceptualizations of how it all

1072.72 --> 1079.83
supposed to work and it's a it's a trick

1076.46 --> 1083.13
if you believe it can work then you can

1079.83 --> 1086.49
imagine it and yeah you don't really

1083.13 --> 1091.95
have an alternative explanation for the

1086.49 --> 1096.38
concept so that's how it works see does

1091.95 --> 1100.26
it make any damn sense though you can

1096.38 --> 1105.169
really emulate it and any empirical way

1100.26 --> 1105.169
you can only claim that it's out there

1110.62 --> 1119.029
and fake it with CGI of course

1113.23 --> 1119.029
[Music]

1137.61 --> 1148.02
without gravity that's interesting huh

1142.19 --> 1153.15
fascinating right well that Mazar Salim

1148.02 --> 1161.1299999999999
if the Grimm flee he doesn't believe in

1153.15 --> 1164.3700000000001
gravity are you sure are you sure about

1161.13 --> 1166.41
that as you like into string theory or

1164.37 --> 1169.5
something where gravity is also being

1166.41 --> 1175.14
excluded how is that work how does the

1169.5 --> 1180.09
motivation come in because I have my own

1175.14 --> 1183.24
interests in refining the conceptual

1180.09 --> 1185.61
idea of outer space and all that

1183.24 --> 1189.33
wouldn't actually be out of space in the

1185.61 --> 1192.05
way that I configured it be the outer

1189.33 --> 1195.77
gas universe with magnetic rails and

1192.05 --> 1200.73
magnetics and gas huge opportunities for

1195.77 --> 1204.74
magical balls spinning through a magical

1200.73 --> 1210.39
space with huge beautiful sites and just

1204.74 --> 1213.8700000000001
fantastical possibilities to feed our

1210.39 --> 1215.7900000000002
imagination that that's how I see it and

1213.87 --> 1218.58
I'm just wondering where other people

1215.79 --> 1221.6399999999999
are going with it once they figure out

1218.58 --> 1224.34
that well whatever NASA and everything

1221.64 --> 1227.5500000000002
is doing whether they believe the earth

1224.34 --> 1229.9499999999998
to be a ball or not once they figure out

1227.55 --> 1233.7
look they're just fooling around and

1229.95 --> 1236.13
they're not doing it right or why did

1233.7 --> 1238.53
they fake that if they could just do it

1236.13 --> 1240.3600000000001
that kind of [ __ ] that's once you get

1238.53 --> 1244.83
that out of the way then you might be

1240.36 --> 1247.31
inclined to try to figure out yourself

1244.83 --> 1251.1
and rely a little bit more on your own

1247.31 --> 1254.61
intuition and insights on mechanics and

1251.1 --> 1257.31
all that 'not realizing wait well maybe

1254.61 --> 1259.7099999999998
we could presuppose some of these things

1257.31 --> 1261.72
to be out there but how would that

1259.71 --> 1265.79
actually work because the official

1261.72 --> 1272.45
explanations start to make less sense

1265.79 --> 1275.24
when scrutinized and that's how I came

1272.45 --> 1278.66
up with the outer gas universe funnily

1275.24 --> 1283.1
enough there is it's really funny there

1278.66 --> 1287.53
was a cartoon it's probably yeah not

1283.1 --> 1292.9399999999998
super special it's like an older cartoon

1287.53 --> 1296.36
from the 80s I think one or two that had

1292.94 --> 1298.3400000000001
an outer gas universe where literally it

1296.36 --> 1305.12
would basically be an airship through

1298.34 --> 1308.72
space it was pretty interesting I guess

1305.12 --> 1312.1999999999998
it was like a fantasy live yeah they

1308.72 --> 1315.65
just made it added a fantasy element

1312.2 --> 1317.66
like that they combined it but yeah most

1315.65 --> 1319.3400000000001
people probably Helia sensors would have

1317.66 --> 1322.5800000000002
seen that as like oh that doesn't make

1319.34 --> 1324.77
any sense what about this space and but

1322.58 --> 1327.9199999999998
they were just like a screw it this is

1324.77 --> 1331.76
our version of the universe and I

1327.92 --> 1335.96
recognize that like there's something

1331.76 --> 1339.23
about that it's amazing it's fantastical

1335.96 --> 1342.19
and there's just something to it like I

1339.23 --> 1342.19
could work with that

1349.24 --> 1358.54
what oh my god Lottie well if I'd want

1356.8 --> 1360.85
to attempt anything like that I'd have

1358.54 --> 1364.12
to have a bath first I don't have a

1360.85 --> 1387.3999999999999
bathtub in this building so that's

1364.12 --> 1389.05
hilarious man yeah or anyway if you

1387.4 --> 1395.67
start to conceptualize in outer gas

1389.05 --> 1400.0
universe with magnetic rail like orbits

1395.67 --> 1402.5500000000002
like natural magnetic rail it's more a

1400.0 --> 1404.95
positional type it would be more a

1402.55 --> 1410.29
conceptualization of the universe of a

1404.95 --> 1416.5900000000001
giant super complex cogwheel of magnetic

1410.29 --> 1420.49
rails like invisible lines that would

1416.59 --> 1422.8
just be spatially there allowing the

1420.49 --> 1425.29
universe to move around pretty

1422.8 --> 1429.21
supposedly all the planets and all the

1425.29 --> 1430.59
phenomena and the gravity would not be

1429.21 --> 1434.02
yeah

1430.59 --> 1439.08
material drawn to whatever no it would

1434.02 --> 1442.6
rather be that the magnetic reel just

1439.08 --> 1446.35
attracts matter to manifest there like

1442.6 --> 1449.56
that almost like how molecules would

1446.35 --> 1454.3799999999999
arrange themselves the idea of chemistry

1449.56 --> 1458.37
that would be the very mechanism of what

1454.38 --> 1460.8100000000002
keeps everything separated and moving in

1458.37 --> 1464.3999999999999
the outer gas universe that's how I

1460.81 --> 1464.3999999999999
conceptualize it yeah

1465.55 --> 1470.05
sorry if you find this very confusing it

1468.92 --> 1472.76
is fiction

1470.05 --> 1476.87
let's hope to be very clear about that

1472.76 --> 1479.3
I'm just tinkering with the entire outer

1476.87 --> 1483.5
space concept trying to make it a little

1479.3 --> 1488.02
bit more viable in some way viable for

1483.5 --> 1490.94
the future so it won't rely as much on

1488.02 --> 1495.59
trying to bluff your way around and

1490.94 --> 1496.3400000000001
trying to evade exposing holes in the

1495.59 --> 1498.26
mechanics

1496.34 --> 1501.74
it's just re-engineer the whole thing

1498.26 --> 1506.36
and well my conclusion an outer gas

1501.74 --> 1509.27
universe if you must have this enormous

1506.36 --> 1512.1799999999998
space surrounding the presupposed ball

1509.27 --> 1513.95
earth with other balls out there that is

1512.18 --> 1515.15
the only way that I can think of that

1513.95 --> 1519.47
good

1515.15 --> 1522.65
somehow supposedly work it's very

1519.47 --> 1527.0
complex still and but it does give rise

1522.65 --> 1529.76
to a great medium setting the outer

1527.0 --> 1533.72
space things could still be real it

1529.76 --> 1535.39
would be slightly different and yeah

1533.72 --> 1538.28
that's the weird thing

1535.39 --> 1541.49
it yeah also there's just all these

1538.28 --> 1545.6499999999999
questions like what are all the gases in

1541.49 --> 1545.65
the universe what would the effect be

1546.76 --> 1551.93
just how would the mechanics of all

1549.74 --> 1554.0
those gases being there and all the

1551.93 --> 1555.8300000000002
bodies in the magnetic rails what would

1554.0 --> 1560.66
that do how would it all affect all

1555.83 --> 1563.77
things would most of space in with

1560.66 --> 1568.91
filled with gas would it be hostile or

1563.77 --> 1571.43
would for a Muslim theatrical miraculous

1568.91 --> 1577.3700000000001
reason most of the outer gas in the

1571.43 --> 1581.9
universe just be nitrogen and well

1577.37 --> 1586.25
probably hydrogen and helium - and like

1581.9 --> 1588.95
that more earth atmosphere alike this is

1586.25 --> 1593.27
all fantasy by the way just to keep it

1588.95 --> 1595.5900000000001
clear here but hey I'm working on

1593.27 --> 1603.37
creating a medium now

1595.59 --> 1605.26
for our storytelling and if things get

1603.37 --> 1609.57
really crazy out there I could imagine

1605.26 --> 1614.41
even roughly it seems kind of crazy but

1609.57 --> 1616.54
potentially they could shift the

1614.41 --> 1618.52
mechanics of how it's all supposed to be

1616.54 --> 1619.3799999999999
towards that direction just to keep it

1618.52 --> 1623.2
alive

1619.38 --> 1632.14
yeah keep old grandpa on the respirator

1623.2 --> 1635.3500000000001
let relief to insert the gas yeah it's

1632.14 --> 1636.45
not amazing but whoo yeah we'll figure

1635.35 --> 1639.52
it out

1636.45 --> 1642.01
in the meantime I'm just gonna point out

1639.52 --> 1646.75
at the flaws of the mechanics of the

1642.01 --> 1650.24
current outer space concept because it

1646.75 --> 1655.65
is full of holes everywhere

1650.24 --> 1655.65
[Music]

1658.64 --> 1667.21
I was was I bought it again

1667.72 --> 1670.72
really

1678.13 --> 1683.2600000000002
decades ago while Bill Thompson I I

1681.04 --> 1686.77
think a little bit more than decades ago

1683.26 --> 1693.64
I think probably at least at least a

1686.77 --> 1696.84
century ago and more this I have no idea

1693.64 --> 1702.3000000000002
a lot II says probably supposedly Nathan

1696.84 --> 1702.3
but ya didn't really notice that

1712.45 --> 1721.0
yeah well they were just being very loud

1716.33 --> 1724.34
and noisy you know it was it was Friday

1721.0 --> 1727.01
you know yet the yesterday debate was

1724.34 --> 1731.6
the same thing on Friday so I talked

1727.01 --> 1734.57
about this debate even yesterday before

1731.6 --> 1737.299
it's streamed so don't confuse it things

1734.57 --> 1740.299
it was the debate the after show Friday

1737.299 --> 1743.32
and yeah they were very noisy because it

1740.299 --> 1747.35
was I guess Friday it was just weekend

1743.32 --> 1756.9189999999999
shivers and they were just in need be

1747.35 --> 1759.139
loud and dominant so I don't mind you

1756.919 --> 1762.1100000000001
know as long as they don't do that every

1759.139 --> 1764.139
single time everything has a time and a

1762.11 --> 1764.139
place

1765.67 --> 1768.789
[Music]

1770.669 --> 1778.509
yeah thank you a gem yeah well I have

1775.299 --> 1782.739
been on the debates panel now for over

1778.509 --> 1786.34
two years so don't don't forget about

1782.739 --> 1790.8690000000001
that the earlybird show is going almost

1786.34 --> 1793.509
a year now I think but the Flat Earth

1790.869 --> 1795.129
debates I did that even a year before I

1793.509 --> 1798.7
started the early bird show the early

1795.129 --> 1801.73
bird show was encouraged and inspired by

1798.7 --> 1803.289
the debates for me to do a daily thing a

1801.73 --> 1805.33
funny thing was it was kind of a

1803.289 --> 1809.499
tactical decision at first because I was

1805.33 --> 1812.499
just very dominant and chattery and the

1809.499 --> 1816.009
idea was okay give me an hour platform

1812.499 --> 1818.32
before it so I can do my talking and get

1816.009 --> 1820.33
it off my chest so I don't interrupt as

1818.32 --> 1822.9289999999999
much during the debates and guess what

1820.33 --> 1822.9289999999999
it worked

1824.82 --> 1832.57
so yeah in a funny way I think that

1829.989 --> 1835.33
Riley also does the same thing because

1832.57 --> 1837.85
he sometimes now starts shows before I

1835.33 --> 1839.4089999999999
have the debates especially when it gets

1837.85 --> 1842.98
passionate about something and then he

1839.409 --> 1845.1390000000001
just does a period of his thing and then

1842.98 --> 1849.94
he later comes on the debates and he's

1845.139 --> 1852.58
also like much calmer and not so not so

1849.94 --> 1854.6490000000001
pushy because he got already got a lot

1852.58 --> 1858.6689999999999
of things of his chest and he can also

1854.649 --> 1863.039
then much easier point at the thing he

1858.669 --> 1863.039
did earlier so yeah it even works

1869.58 --> 1877.71
my show is much more fun is it okay

1872.61 --> 1885.3
thank you I'm I'm here to entertain and

1877.71 --> 1891.57
educate you can always show your

1885.3 --> 1895.11
appreciation by you know donating but

1891.57 --> 1905.82
yeah only if you can does keep me going

1895.11 --> 1908.1899999999998
now hmm also yeah I haven't I think I

1905.82 --> 1913.47
haven't openly shared it yet but I want

1908.19 --> 1917.01
to change my girlf on me because I got

1913.47 --> 1917.91
the camera I got the tripod so yeah it's

1917.01 --> 1920.67
pretty much done

1917.91 --> 1929.21
I don't know how to reset it though do

1920.67 --> 1929.21
you accept checks sure I guess

1930.049 --> 1935.429
it's much easier if you just go to the

1933.059 --> 1938.61
PayPal link in the description box below

1935.429 --> 1941.73
you know I don't see why we need paper

1938.61 --> 1945.6499999999999
checks these that in these times that

1941.73 --> 1945.65
seems kind of a hassle anyway

1947.179 --> 1958.49
distracted oh yeah I want to change my

1950.37 --> 1965.1499999999999
girl fund me into getting a microphone

1958.49 --> 1968.159
arm a proper one for yeah this one

1965.15 --> 1971.669
because yeah I've listening back to a

1968.159 --> 1974.909
lot of shows especially when I get very

1971.669 --> 1977.0700000000002
mobile and stuff it yeah I do notice

1974.909 --> 1979.5900000000001
that you could just hear that doo doo

1977.07 --> 1983.6399999999999
doo doo it's very loud it's annoying and

1979.59 --> 1987.27
the only way to get get that out of the

1983.64 --> 1990.39
way is with a good microphone grip that

1987.27 --> 1992.1
I can attach to the wall or something

1990.39 --> 1994.3500000000001
else than the desk so it's not going to

1992.1 --> 1997.9499999999998
be affected by me touching the desk in

1994.35 --> 2003.4399999999998
any way so but those things are kind of

1997.95 --> 2007.07
expensive I think 200 euros or something

2003.44 --> 2011.78
so well I'm gonna work on that and

2007.07 --> 2014.51
hopefully I can get a small GoFundMe run

2011.78 --> 2018.8899999999999
going for that specifically to improve

2014.51 --> 2021.679
my show but yeah you can already donate

2018.89 --> 2029.23
but I still have to transform it

2021.679 --> 2032.63
properly before I give the start signal

2029.23 --> 2034.72
maybe do a little our winner thumb for

2032.63 --> 2034.72
it

2037.309 --> 2050.399
okay well I yeah I don't think I'm gonna

2046.169 --> 2054.619
mail cannabis to another country that

2050.399 --> 2054.6189999999997
seems like a very bad idea the studio

2057.169 --> 2063.8089999999997
but hey if you come over to the

2059.76 --> 2066.5400000000004
Netherlands and I yeah I don't know we

2063.809 --> 2069.7200000000003
could meet up and I'll definitely show

2066.54 --> 2073.44
you where to find the best cannabis and

2069.72 --> 2079.2599999999998
Hershey's that are around in my

2073.44 --> 2083.849
knowledge so heal the seeds I'd yeah I

2079.26 --> 2085.7700000000004
don't get the seeds of Dallas this I do

2083.849 --> 2089.1290000000004
not have the seeds you're looking for

2085.77 --> 2092.159
unfortunately the seeds are being kept

2089.129 --> 2094.95
secret although I did kind of find one

2092.159 --> 2097.44
seed but I don't even know if it's

2094.95 --> 2101.2799999999997
fertile it did it was strong enough

2097.44 --> 2107.04
didn't break but it was a fluke so I

2101.28 --> 2109.4100000000003
don't know you know I and now I'm

2107.04 --> 2113.849
talking of the seeds of the good type of

2109.41 --> 2116.79
weed as for seeds in general now I don't

2113.849 --> 2123.4700000000003
need any of that I still have plenty of

2116.79 --> 2126.599
seeds from my old cannabis growing days

2123.47 --> 2130.5299999999997
when yeah at my mother's house when I

2126.599 --> 2133.1090000000004
was in charge of breathing that for it

2130.53 --> 2137.0400000000004
well for the family pretty much for my

2133.109 --> 2141.569
mother and me and my dad too I think

2137.04 --> 2147.25
yeah but that's those are relatively old

2141.569 --> 2149.71
seeds but they were pretty potent

2147.25 --> 2152.29
but it's not it's nothing like the

2149.71 --> 2155.32
quality of the cannabis that is out

2152.29 --> 2157.99
there right now it's still good enough

2155.32 --> 2162.849
like it could keep on going but it's

2157.99 --> 2169.02
also very it has a great tendency to to

2162.849 --> 2169.02
procreate it anyway

2171.31 --> 2180.7599999999998
ah well lotty says look I never said

2178.33 --> 2183.49
that I literally took that drug I have

2180.76 --> 2186.7000000000003
an experience I've had a dark world

2183.49 --> 2190.6899999999996
experience and one of the first memories

2186.7 --> 2192.97
I have was of being young

2190.69 --> 2197.7400000000002
oh that's Ferriss it was all very

2192.97 --> 2200.1699999999996
surreal but it was a specific very

2197.74 --> 2202.0299999999997
likely not to be physically real dark

2200.17 --> 2206.86
well experience where I was really young

2202.03 --> 2209.55
and it seemed if I'd have to identify

2206.86 --> 2214.3
what was going on that it was probably

2209.55 --> 2216.61
ayahuasca that I liked sneakily dipped

2214.3 --> 2219.79
my finger into and then tasted and saw

2216.61 --> 2223.6
something special but yeah it is where

2219.79 --> 2226.39
it probably wasn't physically really

2223.6 --> 2229.9
there at the time it's much more likely

2226.39 --> 2233.08
that I was basically interfacing with a

2229.9 --> 2240.73
dark world by DMT created in my own

2233.08 --> 2243.0099999999998
brain it could have been that something

2240.73 --> 2245.62
related to that person had fit like an

2243.01 --> 2248.8
idea somebody brought a idea that was

2245.62 --> 2251.1099999999997
maybe a Luciferian or something probably

2248.8 --> 2255.3700000000003
a lot of liberals you know my parents

2251.11 --> 2257.77
and and that could have shocked me being

2255.37 --> 2261.64
exposed to that without understanding

2257.77 --> 2265.03
what it actually was and I could imagine

2261.64 --> 2268.5099999999998
that triggering a reaction like that at

2265.03 --> 2272.38
giving me a very strong powerful strong

2268.51 --> 2279.9300000000003
meaning dream relating to the event that

2272.38 --> 2282.52
in retrospect now 34 years later I

2279.93 --> 2285.1
understand what it is what it stands for

2282.52 --> 2287.47
what that meant and how big it really

2285.1 --> 2293.44
was it's a big realization that came

2287.47 --> 2296.95
after way way way after I like anyway

2293.44 --> 2300.28
and but I don't think I physically

2296.95 --> 2301.8999999999996
really took it because yeah that's one

2300.28 --> 2307.27
of the weird things in dark world

2301.9 --> 2312.28
experiences they use ayahuasca too but I

2307.27 --> 2314.32
don't know yeah like oh yeah they may

2312.28 --> 2318.01
simply it may be a virtual

2314.32 --> 2319.84
representation to emulate the DMT

2318.01 --> 2324.55
literally already there in your brain

2319.84 --> 2327.76
being activated so it's always puzzled

2324.55 --> 2331.51
me that I have much more memories of

2327.76 --> 2336.88
many more times using ayahuasca then I

2331.51 --> 2339.5800000000004
can physically trace like so it seems

2336.88 --> 2342.46
like in the dark world whether you've

2339.58 --> 2345.73
been launched there because of using it

2342.46 --> 2349.57
in the real world or if it's triggered

2345.73 --> 2352.81
through yeah through the natural release

2349.57 --> 2355.9300000000003
of DMT in the brain if you are in that

2352.81 --> 2359.2599999999998
realm if I when I was in that realm I

2355.93 --> 2362.41
think I've been confronted with people

2359.26 --> 2367.0
taking ayahuasca myself in that realm

2362.41 --> 2371.41
taking ayahuasca as yeah as if it were

2367.0 --> 2377.82
real it's so crazy how that works it's

2371.41 --> 2377.8199999999997
one of the more surreal aspects it has a

2390.21 --> 2393.29
where are you

2404.74 --> 2410.2
that's it's such a well-known movie it's

2408.46 --> 2412.38
so stupid that I keep forgetting the

2410.2 --> 2412.3799999999997
name

2417.07 --> 2422.3700000000003
the great music not Requiem of a dream

2421.27 --> 2428.11
absolutely not

2422.37 --> 2431.5
it's just deprivation and drugs movie no

2428.11 --> 2435.82
I'm talking about the where they

2431.5 --> 2438.61
weaponized dreaming again this very long

2435.82 --> 2441.8500000000004
movie dream within a dream and time

2438.61 --> 2446.56
slows down in the dream the deeper you

2441.85 --> 2449.83
go what is it inception damn it yeah

2446.56 --> 2452.5299999999997
that's the one right so the experience

2449.83 --> 2455.17
of getting ayahuasca within the sub

2452.53 --> 2461.44
realm you damn well better believe that

2455.17 --> 2463.36
felt very much like Inception a lot it

2461.44 --> 2467.2000000000003
really felt like a dream within a dream

2463.36 --> 2469.96
in a way it's but still all elements

2467.2 --> 2472.7799999999997
there were all some tie-in with the real

2469.96 --> 2476.05
world somehow it was derived from real

2472.78 --> 2483.34
world things beyond time it's crazy it's

2476.05 --> 2490.7200000000003
bizarre but yeah I wouldn't recommend

2483.34 --> 2492.9700000000003
trying to do that and yeah like I don't

2490.72 --> 2496.77
I don't even know if it's possible to

2492.97 --> 2501.31
trigger it externally if you don't have

2496.77 --> 2503.38
the right brain build for it I think

2501.31 --> 2505.95
that I just happened to be naturally

2503.38 --> 2505.9500000000003
good at it

2513.52 --> 2523.15
right anyway so yeah so again to answer

2520.36 --> 2525.4300000000003
the question Lodi asked very cheekily no

2523.15 --> 2532.54
I don't think I physically taken

2525.43 --> 2534.3999999999996
ayahuasca when I was five but I think

2532.54 --> 2537.63
that was probably the first time that it

2534.4 --> 2537.63
was naturally tragen

2550.63 --> 2557.4990000000003
yeah well George Sanford flat-earthers

2554.95 --> 2561.299
stay away from those questions because

2557.499 --> 2565.9599999999996
the whole electric universe is still

2561.299 --> 2568.989
technically heliocentric based it is

2565.96 --> 2572.039
yeah the electric universe is kind of

2568.989 --> 2573.729
big step in the direction of my personal

2572.039 --> 2577.3900000000003
conceptualization of the outer gas

2573.729 --> 2581.95
universe which kind of the same thing is

2577.39 --> 2584.489
the magnetic rail it's a the COG of the

2581.95 --> 2584.489
universe

2592.34 --> 2595.1200000000003
so

2604.86 --> 2609.9300000000003
don't recognize Stefan hey listen

2606.84 --> 2613.31
there's no new fuse because it just

2609.93 --> 2617.93
hasn't been any clear skies

2613.31 --> 2617.93
it's all just great soup out there

2621.349 --> 2628.9500000000003
well George Sanford technically I think

2626.28 --> 2632.28
that we are approaching this in the same

2628.95 --> 2639.1499999999996
matter now yeah it technically doesn't

2632.28 --> 2641.099
have to be like even a as a natural part

2639.15 --> 2645.1800000000003
of the realm electricity being

2641.099 --> 2648.7200000000003
everywhere is still logical I'm starting

2645.18 --> 2650.46
to work towards that like that more yeah

2648.72 --> 2652.4399999999996
for the ether based concept that the

2650.46 --> 2657.42
energy is literally present everywhere

2652.44 --> 2661.77
and there's just mechanical ways to

2657.42 --> 2665.609
break open the barrier to the ether in

2661.77 --> 2667.799
order to unleash its energy and let it

2665.609 --> 2670.47
manifest in a more physical manner and

2667.799 --> 2675.359
that's how I think it's so fundamentally

2670.47 --> 2677.1299999999997
happening most energy things arrive like

2675.359 --> 2679.799
that I don't think that the energy is

2677.13 --> 2682.65
literally contained like within every

2679.799 --> 2684.65
molecule as is technically presumed I

2682.65 --> 2688.53
think that there is some energy there

2684.65 --> 2692.79
but it's rather a conduit for ether

2688.53 --> 2695.94
energy and the reaction unleashes the

2692.79 --> 2699.0589999999997
energy from the ether rather than that

2695.94 --> 2704.64
it mechanically contains it that's

2699.059 --> 2706.7400000000002
something that I'm pondering on not

2704.64 --> 2712.02
claiming scientific validity to this by

2706.74 --> 2715.549
the way it's still just speculation but

2712.02 --> 2715.549
to me it does make a lot more sense

2721.3 --> 2724.369
[Music]

2738.46 --> 2748.5
hmm right the electrical differential

2743.5 --> 2751.53
right now polarize nature of of

2748.5 --> 2760.65
electricity of tension itself

2751.53 --> 2763.63
indeed so there is a a an arrival of

2760.65 --> 2767.02
magnetics with matter itself in a way

2763.63 --> 2769.3900000000003
and look if we go on to speculation

2767.02 --> 2772.0
route here concerning the ether the

2769.39 --> 2775.44
mechanics that I just presupposed then

2772.0 --> 2778.54
you could even say look it might be that

2775.44 --> 2781.42
the thing that actually holds the

2778.54 --> 2785.68
mechanical bonds of molecular structures

2781.42 --> 2788.53
and atoms that holds the Foundation's

2785.68 --> 2796.14
together what it actually takes in

2788.53 --> 2799.3590000000004
energy may be lent by the ether so yeah

2796.14 --> 2801.52
that matter itself may exist simply

2799.359 --> 2804.46
because the ether is providing the

2801.52 --> 2814.559
energy for it to form now we're getting

2804.46 --> 2821.19
very close to more assimilatory nature

2814.559 --> 2821.19
of substance fascinating isn't it

2827.249 --> 2830.249
yeah

2859.74 --> 2866.04
slightly different piece apply specific

2864.48 --> 2870.33
electrostatics

2866.04 --> 2872.56
so they actually alter the natural

2870.33 --> 2877.74
polarization of the materials which are

2872.56 --> 2881.71
naturally present and kind of using that

2877.74 --> 2884.1699999999996
change their aerodynamics it's not

2881.71 --> 2886.57
Halloweens that's with birds not with

2884.17 --> 2889.21
not not with insects that would

2886.57 --> 2891.07
bumblebees insects can use

2889.21 --> 2898.69
electrostatics also because of the

2891.07 --> 2904.15
properties their excess skeleton it like

2898.69 --> 2906.55
that material is a I guess like plastics

2904.15 --> 2910.42
or some other types of it's better

2906.55 --> 2913.8100000000004
conductor it's more suited for meddling

2910.42 --> 2917.77
with electrics naturally the

2913.81 --> 2921.0099999999998
exoskeletons of insects birds don't have

2917.77 --> 2925.75
that advantage they have to go purely

2921.01 --> 2928.92
with the buoyancy mechanics and

2925.75 --> 2928.92
aerodynamics of course

2933.5 --> 2936.5
anything

2940.14 --> 2949.359
that's a good question Jarek Matteo's

2945.059 --> 2954.2400000000002
what is your view on of telepathic

2949.359 --> 2958.69
phenomena I got it right well I

2954.24 --> 2961.9599999999996
absolutely know from experience they

2958.69 --> 2965.859
exist however what is their nature of

2961.96 --> 2969.309
the experience is complicated it is I

2965.859 --> 2975.4
think in the core it lies with the very

2969.309 --> 2979.059
nature of our consciousness and I think

2975.4 --> 2981.94
that what it uses it kind of bypasses

2979.059 --> 2986.0400000000004
the physical manifestation reality for

2981.94 --> 2992.2000000000003
our consciousness and utilizes the

2986.04 --> 2998.2599999999998
timeless backdrop realm nature the other

2992.2 --> 3001.859
the non material world and kind of like

2998.26 --> 3004.8900000000003
bypasses regular material obstacles to

3001.859 --> 3006.839
have a more direct connection and how

3004.89 --> 3008.94
the mechanics of that work get it and

3006.839 --> 3015.2599999999998
you're going it's severely ethereal

3008.94 --> 3015.26
concepts and just intuitive sizing up

3018.55 --> 3024.4
I don't know yeah you can make all kinds

3021.61 --> 3026.9500000000003
of comparisons you can compare it to an

3024.4 --> 3029.77
internet connection you can compare like

3026.95 --> 3031.72
a spirit entered the spirit of Internet

3029.77 --> 3035.53
is how it's been conceptualized by some

3031.72 --> 3042.79
people but anyway I don't think there is

3035.53 --> 3045.9700000000003
a direct physical mechanism that well

3042.79 --> 3050.47
maybe there is in a way but my god that

3045.97 --> 3055.1499999999996
would be such in a bizarre design

3050.47 --> 3058.47
edition the creatures would just have

3055.15 --> 3063.73
natural things that would for example

3058.47 --> 3067.54
use specific resonance it's almost like

3063.73 --> 3072.0
we use the utilize electronics just get

3067.54 --> 3075.43
contact remotely without requiring

3072.0 --> 3081.03
material communication that who knows

3075.43 --> 3084.22
you know maybe set under estimating the

3081.03 --> 3091.98
yeah the the depth of the design of

3084.22 --> 3095.2
creation is usually yeah you usually

3091.98 --> 3099.91
just tend to be like what really that

3095.2 --> 3103.33
exists oh my god so who knows maybe it

3099.91 --> 3105.73
is literally a physical and a biological

3103.33 --> 3109.45
design mechanism that is naturally

3105.73 --> 3114.7
present within the gene options of life

3109.45 --> 3118.0899999999997
of humans and other animals perhaps but

3114.7 --> 3121.5699999999997
if you try to bypass that option and

3118.09 --> 3125.92
give a more spiritual explanation then

3121.57 --> 3128.17
I'd say bypass the material realm to get

3125.92 --> 3132.6
a connection directly through the spirit

3128.17 --> 3132.6
from outside of the material realm

3134.7 --> 3142.3289999999997
by the nature of consciousness so I

3138.069 --> 3144.8089999999997
don't know anyway another question

3142.329 --> 3144.809
answered

3166.66 --> 3172.7889999999998
yeah yeah Lottie says I know there are

3171.019 --> 3176.24
there are those teachers that just

3172.789 --> 3181.6400000000003
refuse to budge with the consensus

3176.24 --> 3187.3999999999996
feeling of the impression given to you

3181.64 --> 3190.1299999999997
by politics and media they just refuse

3187.4 --> 3192.529
to budge so they'll be the liberal

3190.13 --> 3195.109
baddies their leave old fashioned people

3192.529 --> 3199.19
that's how that was used to be

3195.109 --> 3204.519
designated well in this case they're

3199.19 --> 3210.25
just being very merciless and strict and

3204.519 --> 3210.25
dominant just showing the facts

3216.23 --> 3224.16
they're not gonna budge they're not

3222.33 --> 3235.1
gonna budge for some feelings or our

3224.16 --> 3235.1
beliefs our manipulations no way yeah

3238.58 --> 3248.89
no they're not wrong brought your MC

3241.87 --> 3248.89
it's just the declaration out of nothing

3250.39 --> 3256.31
it's even even philosophically and

3253.82 --> 3262.76
technically stupid to just say they are

3256.31 --> 3266.42
wrong like it's always always true if

3262.76 --> 3271.63
you be more specific about what specific

3266.42 --> 3274.82
thing or is even a setting and what

3271.63 --> 3276.9500000000003
things in what region in what specific

3274.82 --> 3279.23
things they do are they wrong but no you

3276.95 --> 3281.0299999999997
just had to super over generalize and

3279.23 --> 3284.36
say that or everything that it was wrong

3281.03 --> 3289.78
and therefore nullifying your actual

3284.36 --> 3289.78
point because that's just illogical

3291.34 --> 3301.88
nobody can be always wrong it's

3294.11 --> 3304.46
impossible but there are a lot of people

3301.88 --> 3307.7000000000003
that can be wrong a lot of the times

3304.46 --> 3311.95
about a great deal of things though but

3307.7 --> 3311.95
not everything that's just impossible

3328.89 --> 3331.64
all right

3334.8 --> 3339.8300000000004
it totally on target there marceline

3341.78 --> 3347.63
okay be back in a minute

3461.99 --> 3472.31
right the house or the break

3465.23 --> 3476.54
yeah so let's see I have two people

3472.31 --> 3476.54
that's yeah

3497.57 --> 3505.7000000000003
yeah I'll mr. crow is I'm mr. crows

3500.36 --> 3508.6
doing fine hey Jim the walking around on

3505.7 --> 3514.06
the roof overturning Rock see if he can

3508.6 --> 3514.06
score some bugs or something

3541.89 --> 3550.52
all right yeah mark color is right yeah

3544.92 --> 3553.6800000000003
zero-g planes they don't just go down

3550.52 --> 3559.02
they accelerate down they move in a

3553.68 --> 3561.21
specific arc downwards to neutralize the

3559.02 --> 3564.17
natural acceleration that would happen

3561.21 --> 3567.33
there's very specific stuff to do that

3564.17 --> 3572.79
lets have a very specific trajectory to

3567.33 --> 3578.7599999999998
neutralize the the natural acceleration

3572.79 --> 3581.79
tendencies through the relative density

3578.76 --> 3584.4900000000002
concept by the way that's exactly how it

3581.79 --> 3588.87
works so as these things tend to this

3584.49 --> 3594.18
place so does the entire medium displace

3588.87 --> 3597.66
at an equal footing and there's even

3594.18 --> 3600.24
taken into account that the acceleration

3597.66 --> 3604.47
rate is as if it were in a vacuum

3600.24 --> 3609.6899999999996
because the air that the thing is in as

3604.47 --> 3611.58
it is falling is effectively moving with

3609.69 --> 3616.02
it so there's no air friction therefore

3611.58 --> 3619.38
the acceleration is optimum and yeah

3616.02 --> 3622.53
it's it makes it a little bit easier to

3619.38 --> 3626.36
get to figure out the pathway you need

3622.53 --> 3629.1600000000003
to take to keep it in that exact

3626.36 --> 3634.2000000000003
equilibrium within the disequilibrium

3629.16 --> 3639.48
and then you yeah emulate what they call

3634.2 --> 3643.9199999999996
zero-g as if this placement suddenly no

3639.48 --> 3648.7400000000002
longer happens because you counterman

3643.92 --> 3648.7400000000002
the effects you you neutralize it

3649.29 --> 3654.0
with motion with accelerated motion

3669.51 --> 3677.8390000000004
yeah

3671.119 --> 3679.9990000000003
a zero-g planes they go down but they go

3677.839 --> 3682.489
down into very specific rate I think

3679.999 --> 3685.8089999999997
it's a just a little bit faster than

3682.489 --> 3685.809
freefall effectively

3691.92 --> 3697.46
or was little-ass I don't know either

3694.67 --> 3703.859
but it matches the X natural

3697.46 --> 3708.9900000000002
acceleration rate of the yeah for the

3703.859 --> 3713.16
entire plane in relation to the density

3708.99 --> 3714.5989999999997
of the air outside because that is what

3713.16 --> 3718.319
the plane is traveling through that's

3714.599 --> 3720.2690000000002
the medium for its its entire

3718.319 --> 3722.94
displacement and whatever's inside is

3720.269 --> 3725.1499999999996
all contained and will move with the

3722.94 --> 3729.63
motion so it's not going to be any

3725.15 --> 3733.319
physical obstruction for anything that's

3729.63 --> 3735.65
gonna displace synchronize to the entire

3733.319 --> 3735.65
thing

3740.94 --> 3747.12
creating the effective neutral buoyancy

3743.34 --> 3757.3700000000003
you can call it to zero-g no neutral

3747.12 --> 3757.37
buoyancy or boys no relative density

3757.91 --> 3763.23
displacement neutralization so maybe

3761.58 --> 3767.99
it's like well yeah I guess it's

3763.23 --> 3776.09
relative density this equilibrium

3767.99 --> 3776.0899999999997
neutralization affective naturalization

3779.84 --> 3783.84
because the whole thing is in this

3781.89 --> 3788.69
equilibrium with its surrounding but

3783.84 --> 3792.54
because of the motion specific to motion

3788.69 --> 3794.81
the relative density dis equilibrium

3792.54 --> 3802.2599999999998
that causes the displacement is

3794.81 --> 3806.0099999999998
effectively being it's there it's in

3802.26 --> 3809.3700000000003
motion and because they attitude it to

3806.01 --> 3813.36
very fine level you get this well this

3809.37 --> 3815.67
magical realm within the acceleration

3813.36 --> 3817.53
where it's just it'll stay exactly where

3815.67 --> 3819.66
it is everything it's going to be

3817.53 --> 3821.9100000000003
perfectly neutralized as if relative

3819.66 --> 3825.3599999999997
density displacement certainly no longer

3821.91 --> 3829.17
exists but it does it is all in motion

3825.36 --> 3832.02
just happen to be perfectly attuned so

3829.17 --> 3836.39
that to the ones inside of the container

3832.02 --> 3838.92
of the entire yeah the object falling

3836.39 --> 3841.29
effectively neutralizing relative

3838.92 --> 3844.56
density disequilibrium to them relative

3841.29 --> 3846.75
to them it seems like relative density

3844.56 --> 3849.84
certainly no longer exists except for

3846.75 --> 3851.55
what they can feel from their senses

3849.84 --> 3858.3900000000003
that they are accelerating down that

3851.55 --> 3862.71
it's not normal situation but as to the

3858.39 --> 3866.5099999999998
viewer a purely virtual the virtual

3862.71 --> 3866.51
experience not the visual experience

3867.22 --> 3872.27
when you look at Exit only from that

3869.63 --> 3876.04
angle it really does look like relative

3872.27 --> 3880.96
density this equilibrium is effectively

3876.04 --> 3880.96
negated that's what it looks like

3885.19 --> 3888.19
so

3893.99 --> 3900.06
it's so funny how that worked out you

3897.0 --> 3902.31
know originally I thought I had so many

3900.06 --> 3903.57
elements to proof that gravity was real

3902.31 --> 3905.369
that there was something to it as

3903.57 --> 3908.1600000000003
something had to be there and I learned

3905.369 --> 3910.17
all these things that can be pointed at

3908.16 --> 3914.91
and that people point at when they claim

3910.17 --> 3920.15
gravity to basically back engineer all

3914.91 --> 3923.25
of it work through all of it bit by bit

3920.15 --> 3926.09
detail by detail step by step taking it

3923.25 --> 3929.24
slow because it's pretty heavy matter

3926.09 --> 3929.2400000000002
pun intended

3930.02 --> 3936.48
but now yeah everything that originally

3933.99 --> 3941.8799999999997
I would have used the defend gravity now

3936.48 --> 3944.369
I can simply explain all the aberrations

3941.88 --> 3948.65
all the effects everything all the

3944.369 --> 3952.38
phenomena using the relative density

3948.65 --> 3955.98
theory and it all works out and since it

3952.38 --> 3958.32
is scientifically proven that means that

3955.98 --> 3962.33
I'm literally giving a scientifically

3958.32 --> 3962.3300000000004
based framework of what is happening

3963.23 --> 3969.869
with all these effects completely

3966.75 --> 3972.54
negating any kind of remaining necessity

3969.869 --> 3976.02
for a conceptualization of a gravity

3972.54 --> 3978.27
force it's just become completely

3976.02 --> 3981.32
superfluous in understanding the nature

3978.27 --> 3981.32
of the whole realm

3989.05 --> 3992.099
[Music]

4012.2 --> 4014.98
hmm

4039.8 --> 4042.969
[Music]

4052.25 --> 4062.76
alright ok I think I'm gonna round out

4057.9 --> 4070.5
to show it's pretty quiet except for

4062.76 --> 4073.7700000000004
ballers uh so thanks everyone for coming

4070.5 --> 4075.48
I hope you like to show if you did then

4073.77 --> 4077.0099999999998
please don't forget to upload it and if

4075.48 --> 4078.63
you haven't already subscribe to my

4077.01 --> 4080.0400000000004
channel and hit the bell notification so

4078.63 --> 4082.4100000000003
you know when I'm going live which is

4080.04 --> 4085.17
normally 2 p.m. Amsterdam time every day

4082.41 --> 4087.33
please also do support my channel

4085.17 --> 4090.0
through the paypal patreon my GoFundMe

4087.33 --> 4092.94
and the super chat I would really

4090.0 --> 4097.62
appreciate it I kind of need it to keep

4092.94 --> 4100.32
on going or I'll yeah start to get to a

4097.62 --> 4102.78
screeching halt eventually so continuous

4100.32 --> 4106.259999999999
support is kind of necessary at this

4102.78 --> 4107.73
point so hashtag me fun indeed I will be

4106.26 --> 4113.16
back tomorrow with Flat Earth the early

4107.73 --> 4116.94
bird number 337 and there's no Flat

4113.16 --> 4118.2
Earth debates of course I yeah there's

4116.94 --> 4122.99
gotta be ball busters

4118.2 --> 4127.44
no wait globe busters it's evening

4122.99 --> 4130.62
anyway out yeah so until the next Flat

4127.44 --> 4134.78
Earth early birds yeah have a nice

4130.62 --> 4134.78
Sunday and give it a flat

4135.95 --> 4158.879
[Music]

4161.52 --> 4163.580000000001
you
