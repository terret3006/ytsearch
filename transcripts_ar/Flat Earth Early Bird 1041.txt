102.64 --> 110.159
was pretty cool it was cold

106.0 --> 110.159
and there was a lot of stars visible

110.72 --> 114.92
but now it's kind of back to clouded

129.119 --> 133.039

130.64 --> 133.039

i needed to

150.48 --> 154.84
i just had trouble waking up

156.4 --> 160.56
i think i might be

158.08 --> 160.56
i don't know

162.08 --> 166.56
i might need like a a day break or

164.879 --> 168.63

166.56 --> 171.12
i'm just feeling like

168.63 --> 172.79999999999998
[Music]

171.12 --> 175.59900000000002
so i don't know maybe

172.8 --> 178.31900000000002
tomorrow i might skip a show

175.599 --> 178.319
because it just

178.56 --> 184.48
i need like a serious long break i think

181.68 --> 186.959
been needing one for a while but we'll

184.48 --> 188.39999999999998
see maybe tomorrow everything changes

186.959 --> 192.159
again and

188.4 --> 192.159
we all fit and ready to go

192.48 --> 196.0
if this keeps

194.159 --> 199.64
going in this direction i'm really gonna

196.0 --> 199.64
need a long break

200.8 --> 204.08
which for me would be a day

204.319 --> 208.0
we'll see

205.92 --> 212.07999999999998
for now i'm here i'm gonna

he was referencing

258.56 --> 263.12
the yeah the the premiere from monday

261.359 --> 265.75899999999996

274.32 --> 278.71999999999997
globe or probably anti-flat earther guy

301.52 --> 308.59999999999997
like a long time ago now

304.8 --> 308.6
that was still in september

310.96 --> 314.63899999999995
yeah i i played it on

317.52 --> 325.79999999999995

yesterday i'm just clicking it

335.84 --> 339.84
because it's still on my desktop

345.44 --> 352.039
do i know the number of the show oh

349.039 --> 352.039
no

352.96 --> 358.15999999999997
but it could look that up shouldn't be

355.44 --> 358.16
too difficult

359.919 --> 364.4
like it does mention on the stream when

362.72 --> 368.16
it is streamed

364.4 --> 371.12
so september 17 that's like 30 episodes

368.16 --> 371.12
ago probably

371.68 --> 376.52
so let's start

373.52 --> 376.52
10

377.039 --> 380.039
11.

380.08 --> 383.68

he did start it up right

597.6 --> 602.16
during kiwi live yeah yeah so i didn't

hello stallion8012

667.279 --> 672.76
am i doing today

669.04 --> 672.76
what could be better

674.32 --> 677.7600000000001
i think like this is probably just a bit

676.48 --> 680.88
of a valley

677.76 --> 684.399
where i kind of peaked

680.88 --> 684.399
uh last friday

685.92 --> 689.68
i kind of expected that to happen much

688.079 --> 692.079
sooner but

689.68 --> 692.8399999999999
they didn't it kind of just slowly built

692.079 --> 694.88
down

692.84 --> 698.24
[Music]

694.88 --> 701.12
so yeah i might not do a stream tomorrow

698.24 --> 703.6800000000001
or i might do it after all but i'm just

701.12 --> 707.6
not super energetic right now

703.68 --> 712.519
just issues with my intestines i think

707.6 --> 712.519
and it's been ongoing for a while

723.36 --> 728.24
it was osman

725.76 --> 731.24
on which hit stream

728.24 --> 731.24
what

733.36 --> 737.8000000000001
i don't know what you're talking about

734.48 --> 737.8000000000001
tony whitcomb

759.76 --> 762.0
think

770.839 --> 775.2790000000001

778.079 --> 780.3199999999999
nope

781.44 --> 785.5600000000001
let me scroll through again

790.24 --> 793.24
nope

815.44 --> 819.6800000000001
all right 78 oh it's not that bad you

817.839 --> 822.0790000000001
know i'm not like

819.68 --> 824.079
oh i refuse to

822.079 --> 825.8389999999999
give in to

824.079 --> 828.8
that i'm sick or something it's just

825.839 --> 831.839
that i've been kind of needing a like

828.8 --> 831.8389999999999
a break for a while

831.92 --> 836.8
peaks and valleys

834.8 --> 840.56
i mean i've been like this like on the

836.8 --> 842.88
streams before it's just usually

840.56 --> 844.079
try to pull through but now i just like

842.88 --> 846.8
uh

844.079 --> 848.959
i wish i had just like a very small

846.8 --> 853.92
holiday or something where i literally

848.959 --> 853.92
don't can put my mind on other things

854.8 --> 861.519
just kind of drop all this for just a

857.68 --> 861.519
day or something but i don't know man

863.279 --> 868.079
every time before when i thought that i

865.68 --> 871.279
would just get like all frustrated and

868.079 --> 874.56
jittery right before and then i just

871.279 --> 876.72
start up a stream anyway it's just

874.56 --> 879.5999999999999
it's hard to get a grip on that

876.72 --> 882.1600000000001
how that works for me

879.6 --> 883.6
right anyway yeah thank you stalin 8012

882.16 --> 886.3199999999999
for the care

883.6 --> 888.48
i'll be alright

886.32 --> 890.5600000000001
yeah tony whitcomb i know tim osman when

888.48 --> 893.279
you when you mention osman i know it's

890.56 --> 893.279
going to be tim

894.72 --> 897.72
uh

901.6 --> 906.48
right oh yeah

902.8 --> 908.399
i heard back uh another gerund clip

906.48 --> 912.9200000000001
but that was from a while back because

908.399 --> 912.92
ranty was on there it's so odd

914.48 --> 920.24
that was like very ironic

917.199 --> 920.24
they were talking about

927.519 --> 934.24
psyop like oh psyop and ranty was like

931.199 --> 937.12
oh yeah well you can really tell

934.24 --> 940.36
it was just very silly hearing that

937.12 --> 940.36
but whatever

1011.759 --> 1017.0790000000001
oh you did actually make the song

1014.079 --> 1017.079
cool

1025.28 --> 1031.199
that's nice yeah it's a it's fun it's

1027.6 --> 1035.28
like a pretty spirited song i like it

1031.199 --> 1035.28
and it's so late it's very laid back

1037.199 --> 1043.16
awesome

1038.799 --> 1043.16
hello montix patch

1053.6 --> 1059.9599999999998

1113.84 --> 1117.36
now i'm fine

1115.84 --> 1118.9599999999998
but i'm probably just going to take a

1117.36 --> 1121.9599999999998
day off or something

1118.96 --> 1121.96
maybe

1124.24 --> 1127.24
ugh

1140.16 --> 1144.64
right so you guys want to talk about

1142.24 --> 1144.64

or i mean you want me to talk about

1149.12 --> 1156.84
something address anything

1151.76 --> 1156.84
hello nathan oakley 1980 good to see you

1165.919 --> 1168.64
what is this

1174.24 --> 1180.16
this is so weird

1176.88 --> 1182.72
just the way this article is presented

1180.16 --> 1184.0
is really weird check it out rt article

1182.72 --> 1186.88
i'm

1184.0 --> 1191.32
like they've been building up to this

1186.88 --> 1191.3200000000002
it's so weird to see it like that

1196.559 --> 1202.72
nathan you'd probably be interested in

1199.28 --> 1202.72
checking out that link as well

1203.2 --> 1206.6000000000001
it's weird

1210.64 --> 1215.7990000000002
hello

1212.08 --> 1215.799
hattie jay

1224.08 --> 1227.48
hello m

1235.76 --> 1240.0
can we talk about the sphere of

1238.159 --> 1242.48
perspective

1240.0 --> 1243.76
the what

1242.48 --> 1246.799
you mean

1243.76 --> 1246.799
the field of view

1247.44 --> 1250.64
i think it's the right term

1255.919 --> 1260.6000000000001
they must have a big pool eh yeah

1263.039 --> 1266.32
yeah yeah nathan oakley i know i know

1265.039 --> 1267.039
what you mean

1266.32 --> 1268.559
but

1267.039 --> 1270.32
seriously

1268.559 --> 1272.1589999999999
the way it's presented is like oh this

1270.32 --> 1274.0
is the first

1272.159 --> 1276.88
acting

1274.0 --> 1280.08
officially in space

1276.88 --> 1282.159
so the space part is supposedly real but

1280.08 --> 1284.48
they're still acting

1282.159 --> 1284.48
it's

1285.919 --> 1289.4
very tricky

1290.4 --> 1293.3600000000001
very tricky

1296.96 --> 1303.64
yeah mata you could call it mata

1300.64 --> 1303.64
um

1318.88 --> 1323.2
i do wonder though like what the purpose

1321.12 --> 1326.2399999999998
of it is

1323.2 --> 1329.52
like what are they doing with that

1326.24 --> 1332.64
so are they just going to sneak

1329.52 --> 1334.48
presuppose and realism of space which is

1332.64 --> 1337.1200000000001
actually fake into

1334.48 --> 1340.4
movie making to make

1337.12 --> 1342.559
to literally migrate the the fake medium

1340.4 --> 1342.5590000000002
to

1342.72 --> 1348.72
closer to the actors as it were it's so

1345.2 --> 1351.8400000000001
weird it's very weird article

1348.72 --> 1353.44
it's an interesting idea though

1351.84 --> 1357.8799999999999
in a

1353.44 --> 1357.88
wizard kind of way anyway

1360.08 --> 1366.12
i thought it was noteworthy

1363.12 --> 1366.12
wabbits

1377.84 --> 1384.9189999999999
yeah twixi rabbits

1381.2 --> 1384.919
very sneaky

1389.69 --> 1392.88
[Music]

1447.12 --> 1451.6
all right now that i'm

1448.799 --> 1454.32
that i'm tapping into rt

1451.6 --> 1457.1999999999998
this also stood out to me

1454.32 --> 1458.6399999999999
it's a sci-fi fanboy this kind of thing

1457.2 --> 1462.76
i just

1458.64 --> 1462.76
i do think it's funny

1475.039 --> 1478.32
it does look pretty cool

1479.279 --> 1484.279
it's a pretty amazing prop

1494.159 --> 1500.24
oh you're five minutes behind

1497.12 --> 1503.52
right well that youtube does that like

1500.24 --> 1505.279
it does it to me as well like

1503.52 --> 1507.36
keeps delaying

1505.279 --> 1511.039
and then if i don't pay attention

1507.36 --> 1513.12
there's like this massive gray bar

1511.039 --> 1515.12
and then i have to manually scroll it

1513.12 --> 1517.039
forward very annoying youtube keeps

1515.12 --> 1518.7199999999998
doing that to me i don't know

1517.039 --> 1519.84
to how many other people that also

1518.72 --> 1522.0
happens

1519.84 --> 1523.36
but it happens to me on a regular basis

1522.0 --> 1526.76
now for

1523.36 --> 1526.76
over a year

1528.08 --> 1531.279
it's very distracting

1536.64 --> 1540.44
paused okay okay

1549.44 --> 1553.679
at what altitude does pressure stop

1552.24 --> 1556.679
decreasing

1553.679 --> 1556.679
what

1558.24 --> 1563.52
does it stop decreasing

1560.64 --> 1563.5200000000002
i don't think so

1566.72 --> 1572.919
i'm not entirely sure but i don't think

1568.88 --> 1572.919
so sun monkey 3d

1581.03 --> 1584.24
[Music]

1589.2 --> 1592.72
oh

1590.08 --> 1593.6
yeah i noticed yes yes

1592.72 --> 1596.4
okay

1593.6 --> 1598.32
oh that was very quick of you

1596.4 --> 1601.2
nathan but i did notice the premiere

1598.32 --> 1602.8799999999999
that's fine and yes i was late a half an

1601.2 --> 1606.72
hour

1602.88 --> 1608.4
i might not do a live show tomorrow

1606.72 --> 1610.32
but hey if you want to play premiere

1608.4 --> 1614.5590000000002
during that that's perfectly fine with

1610.32 --> 1617.36
me also because it tends to kind of

1614.559 --> 1621.039
get the trolls away from my chat and

1617.36 --> 1621.039
instead onto your stuff

1623.52 --> 1627.32
and that's kind of convenient

1638.32 --> 1642.6
okay hat tj

1655.25 --> 1658.369
[Music]

1660.88 --> 1664.48
oh you chilled and told the chad to come

1663.2 --> 1667.64
here afterwards

1664.48 --> 1667.64
it's okay

1669.42 --> 1672.519
[Music]

1682.399 --> 1686.4799999999998
yes you did hear me say that stone

1684.24 --> 1688.08
monkey 3d you know why because it

1686.48 --> 1690.159
shouldn't be stopping

1688.08 --> 1691.12
decreasing until

1690.159 --> 1693.2
well

1691.12 --> 1695.1999999999998
it can no longer decrease it's not just

1693.2 --> 1697.3600000000001
going to build up pressure again after

1695.2 --> 1700.3990000000001
some point

1697.36 --> 1700.399
that makes no sense

1702.72 --> 1706.72
but

1704.88 --> 1709.2
yeah the the point where it stops

1706.72 --> 1711.1200000000001
decreasing in pressure is probably where

1709.2 --> 1713.679
there is a

1711.12 --> 1716.08
physical barrier of some kind

1713.679 --> 1719.039
or simply no more

1716.08 --> 1722.6399999999999
space for matter to move into so it

1719.039 --> 1722.64
would be an effective barrier

1723.039 --> 1727.679
but it's not just going to be more space

1725.12 --> 1728.9599999999998
and then suddenly it stops decreasing in

1727.679 --> 1731.6000000000001
pressure

1728.96 --> 1736.679
or starts building it back up again

1731.6 --> 1736.6789999999999
that's guaranteed not to exist

1738.559 --> 1742.6399999999999
thanks nathan

1739.76 --> 1742.64
i appreciate that

1744.399 --> 1751.9599999999998
what you owe it all to me

1748.0 --> 1751.96
i said what is this

1764.32 --> 1767.9189999999999
all right yeah i'll see you soon on uh

1766.48 --> 1771.44
well

1767.919 --> 1773.2
i think in about an hour from now

1771.44 --> 1776.76
roughly

1773.2 --> 1776.76
see you soon nathan

1782.799 --> 1785.799
hmm

1824.32 --> 1828.96
yeah by the way does anybody get what

1826.48 --> 1830.96
sean is trying to like sean is trying to

1828.96 --> 1832.64
get after me or something

1830.96 --> 1836.48
i think

1832.64 --> 1838.64
with his weird little clips about me and

1836.48 --> 1840.96
now he's got one from

1838.64 --> 1843.039
mitchell from my interview with mitchell

1840.96 --> 1844.88
from australia from friday

1843.039 --> 1846.799
but it just

1844.88 --> 1851.8400000000001
like i don't know if he realizes but

1846.799 --> 1851.84
he's effectively now advertising for me

1856.0 --> 1864.399
i mean is he trying to sort of emulate

1860.64 --> 1868.5590000000002
or reversed world mirror quantum eraser

1864.399 --> 1868.559
by making numpty clips or something

1869.36 --> 1873.6
but yeah thanks sean thanks for

1871.76 --> 1876.64
highlighting

1873.6 --> 1879.519
decent snippets from my activities which

1876.64 --> 1882.159
i myself don't do if anybody's noticed

1879.519 --> 1883.2
yeah you have i don't make like

1882.159 --> 1885.44
clips

1883.2 --> 1887.44
of what i do i just you're just gonna

1885.44 --> 1889.2
have to watch the show or other people

1887.44 --> 1891.44
can make the clips i said that other

1889.2 --> 1894.32
people can make the clip so technically

1891.44 --> 1894.3200000000002
sean isn't even

1896.0 --> 1900.88
he's just doing what i'm saying

1898.799 --> 1903.12
as a as a good

1900.88 --> 1906.0800000000002
good little pet a good mind control

1903.12 --> 1909.5189999999998
numpty slave he's just doing what i told

1906.08 --> 1911.36
him to do make clips of me thanks these

1909.519 --> 1915.039
are good clips i know you think they're

1911.36 --> 1917.6
ridiculous because you're insane

1915.039 --> 1921.36
totally out of it but they're actually

1917.6 --> 1924.399
good snippets so thanks john hawkins

1921.36 --> 1924.399
shout out to you

1928.08 --> 1931.36
and i'm not

1929.76 --> 1935.84
sean

1931.36 --> 1935.84
sean hawkins come on classic homeopath

1937.44 --> 1940.159
you know him

1947.36 --> 1953.76
he's uh the one that always starts

1949.919 --> 1957.2
complaining about the polaris challenge

1953.76 --> 1959.279
i went up against him over at uh

1957.2 --> 1960.72
jose jg's

1959.279 --> 1963.12
like uh

1960.72 --> 1966.96
two weeks ago or something

1963.12 --> 1966.9599999999998
a week ago i don't remember when but

1968.399 --> 1970.9599999999998
that guy

1971.919 --> 1976.6000000000001
had you seen that classical homeopath

1977.6 --> 1983.4399999999998
oh any evidence of pendulum sticking out

1980.559 --> 1985.76
of pendulous veins or technically

1983.44 --> 1988.3990000000001
i think he sort of messed it up i don't

1985.76 --> 1990.64
think like nathan was getting very

1988.399 --> 1992.2399999999998
semantical at that point but well

1990.64 --> 1995.76
deserved

1992.24 --> 1998.24
the guy was just totally

1995.76 --> 2002.399
trying to create machinations but he

1998.24 --> 2004.3990000000001
suggested that it is like a pendulum

2002.399 --> 2006.559
he said that

2004.399 --> 2008.7199999999998
he didn't say it had actual

2006.559 --> 2010.6399999999999
a pendulum in it it's just that he kind

2008.72 --> 2011.76
of misspoke

2010.64 --> 2013.679
when he meant

2011.76 --> 2016.559
he was supposed to mention pendulous

2013.679 --> 2019.44
veins and then he probably tried to

2016.559 --> 2023.9189999999999
suggest that they work like a pendulum

2019.44 --> 2023.919
he later did express himself like that

2024.08 --> 2028.0
and of course pendulous vein don't work

2026.08 --> 2031.24
like pendulum at all

2028.0 --> 2031.24
it's ridiculous

2034.88 --> 2040.5590000000002
yeah but that part was particularly

2038.799 --> 2041.36
aggravating no it's not even aggravated

2040.559 --> 2043.84
but

2041.36 --> 2046.1589999999999
interesting because we had our face on

2043.84 --> 2048.96
the flat earth debates where we really

2046.159 --> 2052.879
got into the gyroscope

2048.96 --> 2052.879
i still have like the uh

2053.359 --> 2059.119
is the design specs

2056.24 --> 2061.52
from that time on my computer

2059.119 --> 2064.32
so and i was on top of it i was

2061.52 --> 2065.839
personally curious as to

2064.32 --> 2067.599
gyroscopes

2065.839 --> 2069.679
as a device

2067.599 --> 2071.52
so i really latched on to that because

2069.679 --> 2072.96
it wasn't so much about the math as it

2071.52 --> 2075.839
is about

2072.96 --> 2075.839
physics

2076.079 --> 2080.0
and i thought i needed to know

2080.72 --> 2086.1589999999997
and everybody knew

2083.76 --> 2088.2400000000002
like we went through the manuals to

2086.159 --> 2089.76
really describe what pendulous veins

2088.24 --> 2090.879
were what they were used for and

2089.76 --> 2092.8
everything

2090.879 --> 2094.56
because the polish back then at that

2092.8 --> 2096.639
time it was rumpus

2094.56 --> 2101.56
was already suggested oh the pendulous

2096.639 --> 2101.56
fins they are too correct

2102.56 --> 2106.7999999999997
to keep

2103.92 --> 2109.2000000000003
to supposedly keep the gyroscope stable

2106.8 --> 2111.119
in relation to earth

2109.2 --> 2113.5989999999997
right to keep it

2111.119 --> 2113.599
centered

2113.76 --> 2118.8
anchored to the center of earth that was

2116.56 --> 2120.88
to gravity that was what they suggested

2118.8 --> 2123.6800000000003
back then and we totally demolished that

2120.88 --> 2126.079
and this guy that came on nathan

2123.68 --> 2129.37
oakley's on monday

2126.079 --> 2132.0
kind of tried to do the same thing again

2129.37 --> 2134.48
[Music]

2132.0 --> 2137.359
you didn't see that it's a while ago it

2134.48 --> 2139.839
must be like at least

2137.359 --> 2142.72
at least a year ago maybe more maybe two

2139.839 --> 2145.2799999999997
years ago it was when rompus was still

2142.72 --> 2147.68
um still got on the show

2145.28 --> 2150.2400000000002
before he got banned for blatantly lying

2147.68 --> 2150.24
by nathan

2151.52 --> 2159.359
so yeah that is a while ago

2155.359 --> 2161.839
but if you search on title with

2159.359 --> 2166.72
gyroscopes

2161.839 --> 2166.72
or pendulous veins in nathan's

2167.359 --> 2173.24
video list then you might

2169.52 --> 2173.24
find it pretty quickly

2173.52 --> 2178.079
because i'm pretty sure that there were

2175.599 --> 2180.48
multiple shows with that

2178.079 --> 2184.28
with those words in the title concerning

2180.48 --> 2184.28
that subject specifically

2186.64 --> 2193.2799999999997
no not focal pendulum that's not what

2189.359 --> 2193.2799999999997
we're talking about bad karma

2194.4 --> 2199.64
and besides focal pendulum doesn't do

2196.64 --> 2199.64
anything

2200.4 --> 2204.7200000000003
it's silly

2202.4 --> 2207.2000000000003
it literally doesn't do anything it's

2204.72 --> 2210.3199999999997
just a pendulum

2207.2 --> 2212.8799999999997
they swing it up and then

2210.32 --> 2216.2400000000002
you look at it as somebody suggests to

2212.88 --> 2218.32
you oh look the pendulum is swinging

2216.24 --> 2220.56
in some way doesn't it not really

2218.32 --> 2224.079
relevant but it's swinging and the earth

2220.56 --> 2225.839
is spinning underneath it and that's

2224.079 --> 2228.32
that's it

2225.839 --> 2230.88
that's what a focal pendulum is it's

2228.32 --> 2232.0
just a mind trick you just take a little

2230.88 --> 2233.599
pendulum

2232.0 --> 2235.76
oh look oh the earth is spitting

2233.599 --> 2239.119
underneath i'm not trying to hypnotize

2235.76 --> 2239.119
you or anything really

2239.44 --> 2243.839
this is

2240.56 --> 2243.839
that's focal pendulum

2244.56 --> 2247.619
[Music]

2250.01 --> 2253.739
[Music]

2255.839 --> 2260.96
it has been swinging since 95.

2258.72 --> 2263.839
well that's cute

2260.96 --> 2266.079
but then that means then it there must

2263.839 --> 2268.0
be some kind of a

2266.079 --> 2270.88
an engine on it

2268.0 --> 2273.839
electric probably to keep it swinging

2270.88 --> 2278.2400000000002
because the earth spinning underneath is

2273.839 --> 2278.24
certainly not going to keep it swinging

2278.64 --> 2281.8799999999997
bad karma

2284.4 --> 2290.8
hey j leopard good to see you

2287.92 --> 2293.8
you can make your own pendulum yes i

2290.8 --> 2293.8
know

2301.68 --> 2306.48
that's correct any whitcomb yes it would

2304.48 --> 2308.4
but it doesn't the gyroscope stays

2306.48 --> 2310.72
perfectly stable

2308.4 --> 2313.599
in its orientation

2310.72 --> 2316.0789999999997
the orientation stays the same

2313.599 --> 2319.04
except when you would make certain

2316.079 --> 2320.96
drastic turns which by the way with like

2319.04 --> 2324.32
big jumbo jets and all that is not

2320.96 --> 2326.0
recommended it's actually very dangerous

2324.32 --> 2328.88
can break the plane apart but with the

2326.0 --> 2331.44
smaller ones that's easier to do

2328.88 --> 2333.6800000000003
and yeah that's what the pendulus veins

2331.44 --> 2336.16
are for for the sudden turns when

2333.68 --> 2337.2
there's a certain burst of centripetal

2336.16 --> 2339.2799999999997
force

2337.2 --> 2342.8799999999997
that the gyroscope is subjected to then

2339.28 --> 2344.48
it kind of tends to make a hop

2342.88 --> 2347.28
and that's what the pendulus veins are

2344.48 --> 2352.44
for to prevent that from happening so it

2347.28 --> 2352.44
stays in its rigid orientation

2362.88 --> 2366.7200000000003
oh bad karma please this is

2367.44 --> 2373.119
i'd say this is beneath you then again

2370.24 --> 2375.9199999999996
you are a baller

2373.119 --> 2377.6800000000003
but this is pretty stupid

2375.92 --> 2379.92
i'm not gonna

2377.68 --> 2382.48
make a pendulum to see if it'll keep

2379.92 --> 2384.7200000000003
swinging forever i'm not an idiot it's

2382.48 --> 2387.92
basic physics knowledge

2384.72 --> 2389.04
it cannot keep swinging forever unless

2387.92 --> 2392.079
there is a

2389.04 --> 2395.079
a constant influx of force to keep it

2392.079 --> 2395.079
swinging

2396.0 --> 2401.0
this is really ridiculous bad karma

2411.28 --> 2414.48
hello george sanford

2423.52 --> 2426.88
it's an ex

2425.76 --> 2429.44
but

2426.88 --> 2431.52
that karma that

2429.44 --> 2434.4
why would you need to physically test

2431.52 --> 2435.52
that that's like basic

2434.4 --> 2437.599
forces

2435.52 --> 2440.8
like that's the part where newtonian

2437.599 --> 2443.2000000000003
mechanics kind of work out

2440.8 --> 2445.44
right because it doesn't involve like

2443.2 --> 2447.68
gas behavior

2445.44 --> 2448.96
it's just physics just

2447.68 --> 2451.68
solid

2448.96 --> 2452.4
things and their behavior force wise

2451.68 --> 2454.96
like

2452.4 --> 2458.079
come on

2454.96 --> 2459.359
you really need to test that i mean okay

2458.079 --> 2461.599
if you're like

2459.359 --> 2463.68
12 or something in school in physics

2461.599 --> 2465.28
yeah sure test that

2463.68 --> 2466.56
you know

2465.28 --> 2468.8
why not

2466.56 --> 2468.7999999999997
but

2469.2 --> 2476.0789999999997
like anybody that understands newtonian

2472.0 --> 2478.079
mechanics and its flaws knows that yeah

2476.079 --> 2480.2400000000002
the force is not just going to stay

2478.079 --> 2482.1600000000003
there

2480.24 --> 2485.9199999999996
permanent it's going to decrease unless

2482.16 --> 2488.0789999999997
force keeps getting introduced

2485.92 --> 2491.28
so

2488.079 --> 2493.2000000000003
i don't really need to test that to know

2491.28 --> 2496.5600000000004
how it works

2493.2 --> 2496.56
but yeah you go ahead

2498.72 --> 2502.48
because someone claims no no that's

2501.2 --> 2506.839
actually

2502.48 --> 2508.96
newtonian laws where newtonian laws are

2506.839 --> 2513.7599999999998
legitimate because it doesn't involve

2508.96 --> 2516.2400000000002
gas behavior okay no it does

2513.76 --> 2518.8
it's not about a claim

2516.24 --> 2522.4799999999996
that you need an influx of force to keep

2518.8 --> 2523.599
emotion going perpetually that's just a

2522.48 --> 2524.48
fact

2523.599 --> 2526.56
that's

2524.48 --> 2529.44
physics fact that's where newtonian

2526.56 --> 2531.119
mechanics are legitimate

2529.44 --> 2533.52
because it's not

2531.119 --> 2535.52
the case doesn't involve gas behavior

2533.52 --> 2537.839
okay bad karma this is getting really

2535.52 --> 2537.839
silly

2541.9 --> 2544.9390000000003
[Music]

2562.4 --> 2567.76

2570.319 --> 2573.599
over time

2572.4 --> 2576.599
yes

2573.599 --> 2576.599
probably

2588.56 --> 2592.56
i don't know if

2590.24 --> 2596.24
in like a vacuum chamber it would be

2592.56 --> 2596.24
spinning forever though or

2598.48 --> 2602.319
spinning i mean that going back and

2600.24 --> 2605.72
forth like a pendulum

2602.319 --> 2605.72
i'm not sure

2608.24 --> 2613.04
but with most

2610.24 --> 2614.9599999999996
with all things all

2613.04 --> 2617.2
mechanical forces

2614.96 --> 2619.119
physical objects and such

2617.2 --> 2621.359
it's kind of known that yeah eventually

2619.119 --> 2625.1600000000003
it just stops unless there is a constant

2621.359 --> 2625.16
force inserted

2639.44 --> 2644.16
the issue is the deviation while it's

2641.68 --> 2646.72
the oh concerning the focal pendulum

2644.16 --> 2648.7999999999997
yeah that's what it's supposed to be

2646.72 --> 2651.52
that's what they imply it's complete

2648.8 --> 2653.92
nonsense however like absolute utter

2651.52 --> 2655.119
[ __ ] [ __ ]

2653.92 --> 2658.96
because

2655.119 --> 2662.359
there is no deviation issue

2658.96 --> 2662.359
with a pendulum

2663.04 --> 2669.599
that just isn't whatever they say about

2665.68 --> 2669.5989999999997
it it's absolute horseshit

2670.319 --> 2675.2
pendulum just does what a pendulum does

2672.64 --> 2676.56
swing back and forth

2675.2 --> 2679.359
or in a

2676.56 --> 2682.24
circle if that's how you give the swing

2679.359 --> 2682.24
to the pendulum

2683.44 --> 2689.119
saying it no no it is

2686.16 --> 2690.56
i've already tested this 30 years ago

2689.119 --> 2694.839
cps

2690.56 --> 2694.839
i don't need to test that again

2714.64 --> 2718.92
are there any natural pendulums

2718.96 --> 2721.28
well

2726.4 --> 2730.319
well not literally but there are like

2728.88 --> 2734.2400000000002
things that

2730.319 --> 2734.24
can basically hang by a wire

2734.56 --> 2737.44
so

2735.359 --> 2741.52
but yeah this is not about a natural

2737.44 --> 2744.319
phenomena for a scientific experiment

2741.52 --> 2746.319
i don't think that even

2744.319 --> 2748.64
that pendulum

2746.319 --> 2750.88
focal pendulum actually claims does it

2748.64 --> 2753.68
claim to be a scientific experiment

2750.88 --> 2756.96
that's kind of stupid if it would

2753.68 --> 2758.3999999999996
i would just call it a test as a baller

2756.96 --> 2760.56
but besides

2758.4 --> 2763.52
it is completely useless because there

2760.56 --> 2767.92
is no deviation because of earth spin

2763.52 --> 2767.92
there isn't any it just swings

2768.48 --> 2771.04
in the way

2771.2 --> 2776.96
it's been swung

2773.68 --> 2779.9199999999996
that's it there is no deviation never

2776.96 --> 2779.92
does that ever

2780.16 --> 2784.8799999999997
it's just the you staring at a swinging

2782.48 --> 2785.92
pendulum however it swings and then

2784.88 --> 2790.56
hearing

2785.92 --> 2792.48
a global story about how it's deviating

2790.56 --> 2795.359
and you're literally getting hypnotized

2792.48 --> 2797.599
by a pendulum as you're being told the

2795.359 --> 2800.0789999999997
earth is spinning underneath it

2797.599 --> 2802.4
that's it that's what the focal pendulum

2800.079 --> 2805.76
is right if there's nobody

2802.4 --> 2808.079
there telling you something about what's

2805.76 --> 2809.3590000000004
supposedly happening as this pendulum is

2808.079 --> 2811.119
swinging

2809.359 --> 2812.96
then nothing happens you're just looking

2811.119 --> 2815.04
at a pendulum and trying to figure out

2812.96 --> 2817.2
like what's the point of this

2815.04 --> 2819.7599999999998
it's just a pendulum it doesn't really

2817.2 --> 2822.0789999999997
do anything yeah we know

2819.76 --> 2824.3190000000004
it doesn't it's about swinging the

2822.079 --> 2826.1600000000003
pendulum then hearing a little story

2824.319 --> 2827.599
from a glober about how the earth is

2826.16 --> 2831.839
spinning underneath

2827.599 --> 2831.839
that's it that's the trick

2832.0 --> 2838.319
it's literally classic hypnotism in

2835.359 --> 2838.319
plain sight

2843.2 --> 2848.48
well go and test for deviation then yeah

2846.0 --> 2850.88
you go and test for deviation if you're

2848.48 --> 2853.44
so desperate to try and prove the focal

2850.88 --> 2855.92
pendulum has a point you go test it

2853.44 --> 2856.88
right i don't make a claim

2855.92 --> 2858.88
about

2856.88 --> 2861.2000000000003
it other than just swinging back and

2858.88 --> 2863.6800000000003
forth on a stationary earth

2861.2 --> 2865.52
you're the one that seems to be claiming

2863.68 --> 2868.0
it deviates somehow because of earth

2865.52 --> 2870.96
spin so go ahead then

2868.0 --> 2872.64
stop nagging me about it it's not my

2870.96 --> 2876.07
claim

2872.64 --> 2879.109
bad karma cps

2876.07 --> 2879.1090000000004
[Music]

2879.92 --> 2885.359
i tested it when i was 10 yeah

2882.64 --> 2889.2799999999997
i had physics class in school pretty

2885.359 --> 2889.2799999999997
good physics class cbs

2890.96 --> 2896.64
i had newtonian mechanics the full scope

2893.359 --> 2896.64
of it i aced

2899.68 --> 2903.839
i it a big fan of it

2901.599 --> 2906.88
huh

2903.839 --> 2909.839
i was very puzzled when physics teacher

2906.88 --> 2911.44
afterward told me yeah gravity is kind

2909.839 --> 2912.7999999999997
of conflicted

2911.44 --> 2915.04
and

2912.8 --> 2916.88
it's like officially it's now einstein

2915.04 --> 2918.48
gravy and i would be like but

2916.88 --> 2920.6400000000003
but how does it work then it's like yeah

2918.48 --> 2921.92
it's not a force anymore and i'm like

2920.64 --> 2923.5989999999997
what

2921.92 --> 2925.599
yeah it's more about math now and i'm

2923.599 --> 2926.88
like oh no

2925.599 --> 2928.96
now

2926.88 --> 2930.96
because i didn't like math i didn't i

2928.96 --> 2933.52
don't like math now i didn't like it

2930.96 --> 2935.44
back then i still had math i still

2933.52 --> 2936.559
graduated on math

2935.44 --> 2939.68
because

2936.559 --> 2942.559
i just use pattern recognition like

2939.68 --> 2944.7999999999997
literal number pattern recognition

2942.559 --> 2947.3590000000004
and it got me through i actually even

2944.8 --> 2949.8390000000004
helped other fellow students that had a

2947.359 --> 2952.319
lot of trouble with it i helped them

2949.839 --> 2954.5589999999997
understand it better

2952.319 --> 2954.5589999999997
right

2954.64 --> 2959.2799999999997
but i don't like it when somebody tells

2956.64 --> 2961.1189999999997
me yeah there's this math thing now

2959.28 --> 2964.079
because i know then it's all the

2961.119 --> 2966.4
calculus pattern [ __ ]

2964.079 --> 2969.28
that's probably going to drift off from

2966.4 --> 2971.119
fundamental logic and i don't like that

2969.28 --> 2973.28
at all

2971.119 --> 2973.28
so

2973.599 --> 2977.76
but i did have newtonian mechanics in

2975.839 --> 2980.7599999999998
class very elaborately with a lot of

2977.76 --> 2980.76
demonstrations

2988.16 --> 2994.24
why am i making up i'm not making up

2990.559 --> 2996.6400000000003
stories the who the hell are you dewalt

2994.24 --> 2998.7999999999997
i did go to school and have newtonian

2996.64 --> 3001.04
mechanics everything i just explained

2998.8 --> 3004.079
actually happened

3001.04 --> 3006.319
literally happened yeah i'm not making

3004.079 --> 3010.4
up stories this is literally what

3006.319 --> 3013.119
happened in my life i still remember it

3010.4 --> 3015.04
because i didn't permanently scratch it

3013.119 --> 3017.04
out because i was embarrassed about how

3015.04 --> 3019.7599999999998
much of a demon i was

3017.04 --> 3021.839
i actually vowed to all make it worth it

3019.76 --> 3023.6800000000003
by learning and overcoming all those

3021.839 --> 3026.5589999999997
obstacles

3023.68 --> 3031.96
and so i still remember it

3026.559 --> 3031.96
yeah i'm not making up stories dick

3040.24 --> 3045.2799999999997
hey creation bear

3042.16 --> 3045.2799999999997
i haven't seen you in a while

3045.839 --> 3050.64
ralph rodriguez all right well some

3048.319 --> 3053.2
people like calculus others don't i'm

3050.64 --> 3056.5589999999997
one of the people that doesn't

3053.2 --> 3058.8799999999997
like i i don't like to do calculations

3056.559 --> 3061.28
beyond super basic

3058.88 --> 3064.48
right i learned those by heart i learned

3061.28 --> 3067.2000000000003
multiplication by heart very strictly

3064.48 --> 3068.559
and then i said just like no that is

3067.2 --> 3070.7999999999997
enough

3068.559 --> 3073.52
the rest i'm gonna purely do on pattern

3070.8 --> 3073.52
recognition

3080.559 --> 3085.92
13-year dude

3083.359 --> 3085.92
serious

3087.44 --> 3094.16
13 year old in cell

3090.96 --> 3097.359
well that's special

3094.16 --> 3099.7599999999998
dude you think i'm 13 years old

3097.359 --> 3099.7599999999998
thanks

3101.52 --> 3104.4
that's amazing

3106.559 --> 3109.559
man

3112.079 --> 3118.1600000000003
and yes when i was 13 oh yeah and so i i

3115.599 --> 3121.119
definitely wanted to score

3118.16 --> 3121.1189999999997
and it didn't work

3122.72 --> 3126.8799999999997
i i since then succeeded though

3128.24 --> 3134.319
oh look at behave like a 13 year old

3132.559 --> 3139.28
are you projecting

3134.319 --> 3141.839
are you actually 13 years old

3139.28 --> 3141.8390000000004
the world

3146.559 --> 3152.88
there's a measurable deflection

3149.68 --> 3154.16
repeatedly by measured

3152.88 --> 3155.76
no

3154.16 --> 3158.72
no it isn't

3155.76 --> 3161.7200000000003
you're either a [ __ ] or a straight out

3158.72 --> 3161.72
liar

3172.88 --> 3179.2000000000003
okay so either you get a point move

3175.839 --> 3181.119
beyond this really silly

3179.2 --> 3183.7599999999998
year old behavior

3181.119 --> 3185.92
which i'm not guilty of i call you a

3183.76 --> 3186.88
dick because that's how you got in my

3185.92 --> 3189.359
chat

3186.88 --> 3191.359
so you could choose to either be banned

3189.359 --> 3195.0789999999997
or get a point

3191.359 --> 3195.0789999999997
you choose the world

3195.839 --> 3199.44
where i may measure wait you're pr

3198.24 --> 3201.1189999999997
you're

3199.44 --> 3206.079
my

3201.119 --> 3206.079
proof that something isn't happening

3206.24 --> 3212.0789999999997
really the world

3208.88 --> 3214.48
my measurement proof of something not

3212.079 --> 3214.48
happening

3214.96 --> 3217.28
what

3220.24 --> 3223.9199999999996
no i think that

3221.76 --> 3226.88
i'm not the party that is making a

3223.92 --> 3229.92
positive claim about an effect i think

3226.88 --> 3229.92
that's you

3232.16 --> 3235.359
so

3232.88 --> 3237.119
yeah you're the one that's actually

3235.359 --> 3238.0789999999997
supposed to deliver

3237.119 --> 3240.0
proof

3238.079 --> 3243.119
of this positive claim that you're

3240.0 --> 3245.44
making to say that somebody else who

3243.119 --> 3248.2400000000002
disagrees with you has to prove a

3245.44 --> 3249.44
negative through measurement is kind of

3248.24 --> 3251.04
ridiculous

3249.44 --> 3253.28
right

3251.04 --> 3255.52
that's like me saying okay

3253.28 --> 3257.119
you proved to me

3255.52 --> 3259.68
that unifor

3257.119 --> 3261.119
unicorn farts don't go down go boom boom

3259.68 --> 3264.44
right

3261.119 --> 3264.44
like what

3265.839 --> 3271.04
i am making no

3268.319 --> 3274.079
no it's not my claim

3271.04 --> 3276.5589999999997
i'm not claiming that pendulums

3274.079 --> 3279.28
deviate in their swing because the earth

3276.559 --> 3280.559
is spinning underneath

3279.28 --> 3283.28
that's not

3280.559 --> 3286.0
my positive claim

3283.28 --> 3288.3190000000004
you claim that then you have to prove it

3286.0 --> 3290.24
not me

3288.319 --> 3291.52
i'm not claiming the earth is spinning

3290.24 --> 3295.1189999999997
underneath

3291.52 --> 3295.119
in order to cause anything

3297.359 --> 3302.839
i don't think you understand what a

3298.96 --> 3302.839
positive claim is

3306.72 --> 3310.8799999999997
pendulums move

3308.64 --> 3310.8799999999997
why

3312.4 --> 3315.839
oh deflect

3314.16 --> 3317.92
oh really well can you can you

3315.839 --> 3320.96
demonstrate that can you can you prove

3317.92 --> 3324.319
that it is deflecting

3320.96 --> 3326.079
from an original release

3324.319 --> 3328.0
swing

3326.079 --> 3329.599
that sounds like a positive claim why

3328.0 --> 3331.839
don't you demonstrate

3329.599 --> 3335.48
some evidence for that positive claim

3331.839 --> 3335.48
then the walt

3338.4 --> 3344.1600000000003
yeah

3340.24 --> 3344.16
indeed it's called the burden of proof

3345.2 --> 3350.64
do some basic research well why don't

3347.359 --> 3352.96
you do some basic demonstration of your

3350.64 --> 3355.2799999999997
positive claim

3352.96 --> 3357.76
since the burden of proof is on you for

3355.28 --> 3359.3590000000004
that positive claim i don't need to

3357.76 --> 3362.7200000000003
google anything

3359.359 --> 3365.52
do research i have my research i've

3362.72 --> 3368.319
already presented it

3365.52 --> 3370.559
actually hilariously based on newtonian

3368.319 --> 3372.48
mechanics isn't that just funny it's the

3370.559 --> 3374.3190000000004
part of newtonian mechanics that

3372.48 --> 3376.4
actually kind of work out because it

3374.319 --> 3378.0
doesn't include gas behavior so i've

3376.4 --> 3379.6800000000003
already backed

3378.0 --> 3382.48
my statements up

3379.68 --> 3383.5989999999997
with some basic research how about you

3382.48 --> 3385.359
dewalt

3383.599 --> 3387.599
how about you

3385.359 --> 3390.0
oh you're gonna just copy paste the same

3387.599 --> 3393.52
[ __ ] over and over again said is it ban

3390.0 --> 3393.52
time for you num ti

3397.28 --> 3402.0
why why don't you

3399.119 --> 3404.799
try out nathan oakley's

3402.0 --> 3407.839
discord why don't you go to discord and

3404.799 --> 3410.72
join the flat earth debates

3407.839 --> 3414.599
i'm sure that nathan is very willing to

3410.72 --> 3414.5989999999997
entertain you

3418.799 --> 3425.359
god thinks he's an arwyn okay that's

3421.28 --> 3425.3590000000004
hilarious lester tesser i like that

3425.839 --> 3429.92
i don't know if he thinks he's in our

3427.68 --> 3429.9199999999996
win

3430.72 --> 3436.72
i think that arwen is

3433.04 --> 3436.72
seemingly a little beneath him

3438.0 --> 3442.599
whoever this little g-god is

3452.079 --> 3456.319
nathan's a [ __ ] why would i waste my

3454.0 --> 3458.559
time there well because you are making a

3456.319 --> 3461.119
positive claim and

3458.559 --> 3463.0400000000004
you seem to want to defend your globe

3461.119 --> 3466.319
religion that includes the earth

3463.04 --> 3469.839
spinning underneath in order to cause a

3466.319 --> 3471.839
supposed deviation in a pendulum swing

3469.839 --> 3475.44
which is a positive claim

3471.839 --> 3478.24
that you should be backing with evidence

3475.44 --> 3481.119
well why don't you try that out on the

3478.24 --> 3482.0789999999997
flat earth debates instead of wasting my

3481.119 --> 3485.119
time

3482.079 --> 3486.96
here in my chat

3485.119 --> 3489.839
trying to reverse the burden of proof

3486.96 --> 3489.839
onto me

3512.16 --> 3517.359
it is though is we wouldn't know the

3514.4 --> 3520.48
waltz who's now starting to no longer

3517.359 --> 3523.52
respond to what i say but is deflecting

3520.48 --> 3524.48
off to my to my chat audience huh the

3523.52 --> 3526.319
wall

3524.48 --> 3528.48
yeah

3526.319 --> 3530.64
it is though well why don't you present

3528.48 --> 3532.48
that evidence then for that positive

3530.64 --> 3534.8799999999997
claim right instead of just saying it's

3532.48 --> 3539.76
there just do some basic research just

3534.88 --> 3539.76
google it why don't you present it then

3540.96 --> 3546.559
you know you could start by

3544.4 --> 3550.0
calculating it

3546.559 --> 3552.6400000000003
right so how much is the pendulum gonna

3550.0 --> 3554.559
deviate in its swing because the earth

3552.64 --> 3557.1189999999997
is spinning underneath you

3554.559 --> 3558.799
why don't you calculate that then

3557.119 --> 3561.52
right then you've got a calculation

3558.799 --> 3563.2
based on a spinning globe model

3561.52 --> 3565.7599999999998
and then you can test

3563.2 --> 3568.0
whether that calculation actually works

3565.76 --> 3569.119
out in physical reality

3568.0 --> 3571.28
it's called

3569.119 --> 3572.799
a test

3571.28 --> 3575.3590000000004
you can do that

3572.799 --> 3577.92
so you can actually back

3575.359 --> 3580.16
your positive claim

3577.92 --> 3581.92
right

3580.16 --> 3586.359
you could do that

3581.92 --> 3586.359
15 degrees an hour

3593.599 --> 3596.559
that doesn't sound like a calculation to

3595.839 --> 3598.799
me

3596.559 --> 3601.6800000000003
besides

3598.799 --> 3605.28
the like what

3601.68 --> 3607.52
15 degrees an hour depend like

3605.28 --> 3611.119
you mean that like the swing back and

3607.52 --> 3613.92
forth is turning 15 degrees an hour is

3611.119 --> 3616.559
that your claim do you really think that

3613.92 --> 3616.559
happens

3617.47 --> 3622.49
[Laughter]

3624.96 --> 3630.319
that's hilarious

3627.28 --> 3632.4
oh that's good thank you

3630.319 --> 3635.359
see that's why i like to keep

3632.4 --> 3637.599
numpties around in my chat

3635.359 --> 3637.5989999999997
oh

3637.92 --> 3641.799
oh that's so funny

3646.079 --> 3650.4
oh so it's not oh okay okay

3651.2 --> 3657.839
i i have to laugh about it anyway but

3654.16 --> 3657.839
anyway yeah i'll be back in two minutes

3743.2 --> 3746.2
um

3751.69 --> 3760.799
[Music]

3757.599 --> 3763.6800000000003
yo rodriguez where are you poking james

3760.799 --> 3763.68
james's ace

3764.24 --> 3768.1189999999997
he supports my channel

3774.24 --> 3779.16
me and you this

3775.92 --> 3779.16
oh wow

3782.0 --> 3786.24
okay creation if you're going to do that

3783.76 --> 3790.2000000000003
make sure you record it

3786.24 --> 3790.2
that that's going to be hilarious

3803.76 --> 3807.92
all right

3805.44 --> 3811.44
okay so dewalt

3807.92 --> 3813.359
the procession is zero at the polls

3811.44 --> 3815.599
increases as you get closing to the

3813.359 --> 3817.92
equator so why don't you actually test

3815.599 --> 3821.3590000000004
that why didn't i know that

3817.92 --> 3821.359
that sounds like a claim

3821.68 --> 3828.0
why don't you demonstrate it i mean

3824.799 --> 3831.0389999999998
you're somewhere on earth right

3828.0 --> 3834.88
not at the north pole i bet and probably

3831.039 --> 3837.599
not super close to the equator either

3834.88 --> 3840.1600000000003
so yeah you should be able to calculate

3837.599 --> 3842.0
how much

3840.16 --> 3843.2799999999997
the precession

3842.0 --> 3847.2
should be

3843.28 --> 3847.2000000000003
and then demonstrate it

3847.599 --> 3854.559
it's been no demonstrated you

3851.319 --> 3856.5589999999997
demonstrated saying it's been tested

3854.559 --> 3858.6400000000003
it's been researched

3856.559 --> 3862.079
it's been calculated

3858.64 --> 3864.64
that's cute those are all claims

3862.079 --> 3866.6400000000003
demonstrated show that it actually works

3864.64 --> 3867.52
like that yourself

3866.64 --> 3870.72
right

3867.52 --> 3872.24
or is it too difficult to get a pendulum

3870.72 --> 3874.5589999999997
to swing

3872.24 --> 3876.85
is that too difficult a task

3874.559 --> 3878.559
for you dewalt

3876.85 --> 3882.799
[Music]

3878.559 --> 3884.4
you don't have the resources to test it

3882.799 --> 3885.52
oh my g

3884.4 --> 3888.4
what

3885.52 --> 3891.839
you can't even make a pendulum

3888.4 --> 3891.839
are you serious bro

3893.2 --> 3897.9199999999996
all you need

3894.88 --> 3898.7200000000003
is a little weight

3897.92 --> 3900.96
just

3898.72 --> 3903.68
anything with like a hook on it or a

3900.96 --> 3906.88
ring and then a rope

3903.68 --> 3909.5989999999997
and then you attach the rope to

3906.88 --> 3911.839
something just something with a high

3909.599 --> 3916.4
dude you could tie it to your flexible

3911.839 --> 3919.0389999999998
lamppers what dude it's a pendulum like

3916.4 --> 3920.839
a five-year-old could make it very

3919.039 --> 3923.6800000000003
quickly from

3920.839 --> 3926.16
stuff can't be seriously telling me you

3923.68 --> 3929.44
don't have the resources to demonstrate

3926.16 --> 3929.44
are you serious man

3930.4 --> 3936.96
can i do it oh i have to do it oh

3933.599 --> 3939.28
could it be that you can't do it because

3936.96 --> 3941.359
you're not really a physical person and

3939.28 --> 3943.92
you can't actually do out anything

3941.359 --> 3945.7599999999998
outside of your computer so you want us

3943.92 --> 3949.359
to do it for you

3945.76 --> 3951.119
or are you just incredibly lazy

3949.359 --> 3953.2799999999997
and you don't want to step away from

3951.119 --> 3956.1600000000003
your little mobile or something or your

3953.28 --> 3958.559
desktop laptop whatever it is

3956.16 --> 3958.5589999999997
i mean

3961.28 --> 3965.44
you can't even like

3963.359 --> 3967.44
make a pendulum

3965.44 --> 3969.68
really you don't have the resources for

3967.44 --> 3969.68
that

3970.799 --> 3973.28
like what

3974.96 --> 3978.799
this is

3976.559 --> 3981.8390000000004
yeah distractions i agree it's just

3978.799 --> 3981.839
getting annoying now

3988.799 --> 3993.319
uh

3990.319 --> 3993.319
what

3998.16 --> 4002.799
right okay james mason well

4000.64 --> 4002.799
no

4004.319 --> 4008.72
that

4005.039 --> 4011.599
you you uttered the sentence

4008.72 --> 4014.16
do you believe he died for our sins no

4011.599 --> 4015.44
no he didn't whoever in certain that

4014.16 --> 4018.7599999999998
sentence

4015.44 --> 4018.76
is a satanist

4020.16 --> 4024.2799999999997
everything else is fine though

4039.76 --> 4047.7200000000003
i know he was talking to your cps

4043.76 --> 4047.7200000000003
but i still read it

4048.88 --> 4052.7200000000003
right but yeah james mason this guy is

4050.88 --> 4054.88
definitely not a christian

4052.72 --> 4057.4399999999996
that should be obvious it's by the way

4054.88 --> 4060.1600000000003
it is tiny wumble

4057.44 --> 4062.559
just changed his name for some reason

4060.16 --> 4065.7599999999998
even though his original account isn't

4062.559 --> 4068.3190000000004
banned i checked it yesterday

4065.76 --> 4068.3190000000004
visibly

4070.559 --> 4074.7200000000003
why did he die and rise again i don't

4072.559 --> 4077.3590000000004
know if he did die

4074.72 --> 4080.799
james mason i don't know for sure

4077.359 --> 4083.2799999999997
but what i do know is that he brought us

4080.799 --> 4085.68
the greatest enlightenment in the

4083.28 --> 4088.799
darkest times

4085.68 --> 4091.5989999999997
and his wisdom and knowledge still

4088.799 --> 4093.839
echoes on through our spirits to this

4091.599 --> 4096.56
day

4093.839 --> 4098.08
he saved the world by living and

4096.56 --> 4100.4800000000005
teaching us

4098.08 --> 4103.199
not by dying

4100.48 --> 4105.599999999999
human sacrifices don't accomplish

4103.199 --> 4108.96
anything

4105.6 --> 4108.96
except wicked things

4112.0 --> 4116.56
and it's definitely not going to take

4113.6 --> 4116.56
your sins away

4116.88 --> 4122.839
because if it did then those sins were

4119.44 --> 4122.839
never real

4132.96 --> 4137.759
because i'm banned and i checked it yeah

4134.719 --> 4142.2390000000005
and i also showed it on screen that you

4137.759 --> 4144.799
were not in the banned list cps

4142.239 --> 4147.839
i showed it on screen i don't know what

4144.799 --> 4147.839
you're talking about

4153.52 --> 4156.64
yeah

4154.64 --> 4158.64
yes we were born free

4156.64 --> 4161.6
free to believe what i like

4158.64 --> 4162.4800000000005
yeah also free to pay attention

4161.6 --> 4165.6
to

4162.48 --> 4165.599999999999
god's rules

4167.52 --> 4172.2390000000005
and to logic itself the realization of

4170.64 --> 4177.4400000000005
the design

4172.239 --> 4179.759
and the origin of knowledge and spirit

4177.44 --> 4181.678999999999
which is god

4179.759 --> 4185.56
and then just drawing logical

4181.679 --> 4185.56
consequences right

4190.96 --> 4194.8
right

4192.08 --> 4197.36
jesus is not taking away sins

4194.8 --> 4200.64
he's revealing them for what they are

4197.36 --> 4203.759999999999
and giving you the choice

4200.64 --> 4204.8
to deal with him and to try to stay away

4203.76 --> 4206.88
from him

4204.8 --> 4208.96
and if you can't

4206.88 --> 4212.4800000000005
to learn

4208.96 --> 4215.679
to face the consequences of the sin

4212.48 --> 4219.599999999999
he's not taking it away he just showed

4215.679 --> 4219.6
them where they are

4221.6 --> 4226.320000000001
that's what he's actually done

4223.84 --> 4228.2390000000005
that's what his legacy

4226.32 --> 4233.04
in the bible the red letter that's what

4228.239 --> 4236.799999999999
that actually does probably provably

4233.04 --> 4238.159
right it's it's so self-evident when you

4236.8 --> 4240.159000000001
think about it

4238.159 --> 4242.5599999999995
you only have to remind somebody and in

4240.159 --> 4244.639999999999
their spirit they will know it's true if

4242.56 --> 4247.6
they actually care

4244.64 --> 4247.6
about any of that

4254.08 --> 4258.64
but to have someone

4256.8 --> 4260.56
die

4258.64 --> 4264.4800000000005
to change

4260.56 --> 4268.8
the fabric of creation itself

4264.48 --> 4271.44
in order to lift the effect of sin

4268.8 --> 4273.92
is kind of preposterous

4271.44 --> 4277.36
because that is an intrical part of the

4273.92 --> 4281.04
design of creation itself

4277.36 --> 4282.32
like if there was no sin

4281.04 --> 4284.32
then

4282.32 --> 4286.0
there would be no morality

4284.32 --> 4287.28
because then none of it matters it's

4286.0 --> 4290.719
satanic

4287.28 --> 4292.8
the very suggestion is satanic when you

4290.719 --> 4295.04
think about it

4292.8 --> 4297.12
it really is i know it's one of the most

4295.04 --> 4298.719
shocking things within christianity

4297.12 --> 4301.84
you've probably ever heard

4298.719 --> 4301.84
that's why i'm here

4302.0 --> 4310.239
to lift that very difficult to lift veil

4305.92 --> 4313.679
and show you what the origin of this is

4310.239 --> 4316.639999999999
and if yes or what is it

4313.679 --> 4316.64
is it sunday

4317.52 --> 4321.120000000001
i did a whole show about it

4321.199 --> 4326.32
even demonstrating like how that very

4323.52 --> 4329.040000000001
saying is destructive

4326.32 --> 4331.679
and that it should only be used in very

4329.04 --> 4334.239
niche situation when somebody is about

4331.679 --> 4336.4
to crumble or like commit suicide under

4334.239 --> 4339.04
the stress of their own sins

4336.4 --> 4341.28
like that's like the only moment i'd say

4339.04 --> 4343.199
like okay

4341.28 --> 4345.12
tactically

4343.199 --> 4347.36
it might work

4345.12 --> 4349.199
to snap somebody out of it to get them

4347.36 --> 4350.799999999999
over the threshold but

4349.199 --> 4352.719
other than that you should never say

4350.8 --> 4357.28
that because most people when they say

4352.719 --> 4360.719
it they just use it for peer pressure

4357.28 --> 4363.679
or to ignore things to ignore

4360.719 --> 4363.679
their own sins

4366.48 --> 4371.199
who are you to know the mind of god

4369.679 --> 4375.04
well isn't god

4371.199 --> 4379.599999999999
right there isn't he there all the time

4375.04 --> 4379.6
when did jesus ever say it he didn't

4380.719 --> 4384.719
like there's a lot of people in the

4382.4 --> 4387.5199999999995
bible and they do all kinds of things

4384.719 --> 4390.159
and they say all kinds of things

4387.52 --> 4392.320000000001
and some of which are literally pointed

4390.159 --> 4395.12
out as this is wrong

4392.32 --> 4397.679
you're making a mistake by jesus so why

4395.12 --> 4400.48
would you then assume

4397.679 --> 4402.08
that everybody in the bible is

4400.48 --> 4405.28
right

4402.08 --> 4405.28
about their assumptions

4407.199 --> 4410.44
you see

4414.159 --> 4417.599999999999
still ban this tiny woman

4424.32 --> 4427.5599999999995
all right

4428.239 --> 4433.08
i'll check again

4429.84 --> 4433.08
i guess

4439.33 --> 4443.659
[Music]

4443.76 --> 4448.4800000000005
dude there isn't even a word tiny in

4446.159 --> 4449.839999999999
there at all

4448.48 --> 4453.12
like none

4449.84 --> 4456.64
the word tiny doesn't even pop up in

4453.12 --> 4456.64
in my band list at all

4465.52 --> 4468.52
two

4474.4 --> 4479.799999999999
i'm literally going for the letter t now

4485.12 --> 4488.92
i have a lot of moderators

4553.36 --> 4557.159
sorry for the long silence i'm

4555.92 --> 4559.12
literally

4557.159 --> 4561.36
painstakingly

4559.12 --> 4565.12
trying to find tiny wumble's account

4561.36 --> 4565.12
which he says is banned

4565.84 --> 4571.28
even though i'm not finding it

4568.8 --> 4571.28
at all

4572.159 --> 4578.48
when i actually search for the word tiny

4575.52 --> 4578.4800000000005
nothing pops up

4579.6 --> 4586.159000000001
so i'm just going by the word t now

4583.36 --> 4589.679
the word the letter t

4586.159 --> 4589.679
it's taking a little longer

4592.719 --> 4595.719
nope

4596.4 --> 4599.12
oh what

4603.04 --> 4611.329
oh wait

4605.46 --> 4611.329
[Music]

4615.04 --> 4618.04
god

4622.159 --> 4630.28
there was a lot more

4624.4 --> 4630.28
but still the word tiny does not pop up

4697.28 --> 4702.48
so i don't know what you did man i

4699.44 --> 4704.639999999999
really don't but you are not in here

4702.48 --> 4708.799999999999
don't think i

4704.64 --> 4708.8
kind of like blocked blocked you

4711.679 --> 4717.2390000000005
there's no way

4713.76 --> 4717.2390000000005
anyway whatever

4725.44 --> 4727.28
what

4726.32 --> 4729.5199999999995
why

4727.28 --> 4733.5599999999995
listen to george bible literalist

4729.52 --> 4733.56
blocking it bible literalist

4734.159 --> 4738.08
i don't agree with how she conducts

4736.08 --> 4741.08
herself at all

4738.08 --> 4741.08
so

4751.84 --> 4755.84
if a mod has you blocked

4754.4 --> 4757.28
oh

4755.84 --> 4759.1990000000005
well

4757.28 --> 4761.92
huh

4759.199 --> 4763.12
one of my moderators could have blocked

4761.92 --> 4765.4400000000005
you

4763.12 --> 4765.44
okay

4766.08 --> 4770.719
well i can't do anything about it that

4768.48 --> 4772.159
might be if somebody in here with a

4770.719 --> 4774.64
wrench

4772.159 --> 4777.199
has actually blocked tiny womble at some

4774.64 --> 4779.6
point

4777.199 --> 4781.599999999999
like google blocked him yeah then

4779.6 --> 4782.64
there's nothing i can do about that at

4781.6 --> 4785.04
all

4782.64 --> 4786.2390000000005
and i'm sure i haven't blocked him like

4785.04 --> 4789.12
that

4786.239 --> 4791.759999999999
don't see why i would do that i only do

4789.12 --> 4795.32
that to just the most annoying

4791.76 --> 4795.320000000001
spammy trolls

4809.12 --> 4812.12
so

4828.8 --> 4831.8
so

4836.0 --> 4840.159
right

4837.04 --> 4843.199
anyway okay i guess i'll just have to

4840.159 --> 4846.44
do with the cps account that's fine i

4843.199 --> 4846.44
don't mind

4849.84 --> 4852.84
hmm

4867.03 --> 4871.5199999999995
[Music]

4868.88 --> 4874.87
hmm okay what was i missing while i was

4871.52 --> 4877.939
trying to find his name in a banned list

4874.87 --> 4877.939
[Music]

4906.159 --> 4908.48
right

4912.639 --> 4918.4800000000005
but yeah back to what i said to you

4915.6 --> 4920.96
james mason when you're talking about

4918.48 --> 4925.199
jesus dying for our sins and all that

4920.96 --> 4925.199
i am actually hoping to basically

4926.56 --> 4930.88
get that through to the entirety of

4929.12 --> 4934.159
christianity

4930.88 --> 4936.159000000001
which seems like an impossible task

4934.159 --> 4938.239
because everybody's chanting it and

4936.159 --> 4940.4
getting very hostile when you go against

4938.239 --> 4940.4
it

4941.12 --> 4944.8
but i really do believe it's like a

4943.28 --> 4949.5199999999995
curse within it

4944.8 --> 4949.52
i believe that i feel that

4950.88 --> 4957.52
people that chant it the most tend out

4954.08 --> 4958.5599999999995
to be like grabblers

4957.52 --> 4961.280000000001
within

4958.56 --> 4964.080000000001
its system like the ones very eager to

4961.28 --> 4968.239
use the priestly power of it

4964.08 --> 4968.239
they're the ones that say that a lot

4968.48 --> 4972.799999999999
and i think it is a priestly tool it's

4970.48 --> 4976.159
like an indoctrination tool created by

4972.8 --> 4979.1990000000005
the early catholic priesthood

4976.159 --> 4981.599999999999
in the theocracy days

4979.199 --> 4984.839999999999
when they had full spell

4981.6 --> 4987.360000000001
capacity when they could just say

4984.84 --> 4989.28
anything as long as it

4987.36 --> 4991.28
you could deduce it from the bible and

4989.28 --> 4992.96
they could say that and use that to make

4991.28 --> 4995.12
their judgment

4992.96 --> 4998.96
even to the execute people

4995.12 --> 4998.96
it was a theocracy so

4999.6 --> 5001.76
i

5000.96 --> 5004.4
wish

5001.76 --> 5007.679
that would go away and people would just

5004.4 --> 5010.92
focus on christ's actual teaching and as

5007.679 --> 5010.92
an example

5015.36 --> 5020.839999999999
oh that's okay cps i i did it by myself

5038.639 --> 5043.400000000001
all right i'm gonna round out the show

5040.08 --> 5043.4
by the way

5048.96 --> 5054.2390000000005
it's been a bit short

5051.92 --> 5058.56
still hope you guys were

5054.239 --> 5058.5599999999995
entertained and thought provoked

5059.36 --> 5064.32
so yeah i might not do a show tomorrow

5062.08 --> 5066.639
but then again maybe

5064.32 --> 5068.32
it'll be like this bright sunny day all

5066.639 --> 5072.8
of a sudden out of nowhere again and

5068.32 --> 5072.799999999999
that typically does get me fired up to

5073.76 --> 5078.719
to actually do a stream not that i'm not

5076.159 --> 5081.36
fired up most of the time it's just that

5078.719 --> 5083.28
it does kind of extra give me an extra

5081.36 --> 5086.48
push

5083.28 --> 5086.48
extra push of energy

5088.48 --> 5093.589999999999
and i'm yeah feeling feeling uh

5091.44 --> 5095.5199999999995
not really sick but like

5093.59 --> 5097.1990000000005
