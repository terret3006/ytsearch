225.319 --> 231.2
enough time not to be super

228.12 --> 233.0
late still was a bit late though it's

231.2 --> 234.879
also because I don't know somebody

233.0 --> 236.799
decided to take a shower right when it

234.879 --> 238.67999999999998
was actually

236.799 --> 241.68
meing

238.68 --> 241.68
h

242.04 --> 248.35999999999999
right but I'm here and I'm hungry and I

246.12 --> 252.079
got an Illuminati CU I'm going to dig in

248.36 --> 252.079
pretty quickly because I am really

252.56 --> 256.959
hungry so I'm going to do that right now

254.879 --> 259.959
hello fiber outs good to see

256.959 --> 259.959
you

261.73 --> 268.25
[Music]

268.6 --> 271.6
cheers

272.02 --> 275.209
[Music]

280.05 --> 283.249
[Music]

299.12 --> 301.88
ah

300.8 --> 304.56
so

301.88 --> 311.0
yeah yesterday

304.56 --> 313.08
uh my order came in for the um monitor

311.0 --> 316.639
stand

313.08 --> 318.52
but the screws or the bolts that they

316.639 --> 323.44
brought with it that I'm supposed to

318.52 --> 323.44
attach to my monitor are all too

323.56 --> 329.639
long which is really

327.08 --> 331.68
annoying cuz now I got to have to yeah I

329.639 --> 333.56
going to have to find replacement bolts

331.68 --> 338.40000000000003
that are like half the

333.56 --> 338.4
size or some way to fix

339.319 --> 345.91900000000004
it and it's probably going to cost me

341.919 --> 347.75899999999996
money to do that which I don't know if I

345.919 --> 352.28
even have

347.759 --> 355.6
enough so it's a bit tedious

352.28 --> 358.28
but oh well I'm almost there I'm almost

355.6 --> 358.28000000000003
there with a new

358.479 --> 364.199
monitor

361.06 --> 364.199
[Music]

371.52 --> 374.039
fa

374.24 --> 377.24
whz

384.16 --> 387.47900000000004
what what's

387.759 --> 391.40000000000003
th you mean the

399.22 --> 405.47900000000004
[Music]

401.08 --> 405.479
wind oh otherwise oh

407.72 --> 413.34000000000003
okay yeah I didn't see

410.12 --> 416.52
that all

413.34 --> 416.52
[Music]

418.4 --> 421.4
right

424.52 --> 430.44
I'm going to continue this I am really

426.44 --> 430.44
hungry I did not eat all that much

445.69 --> 451.319
[Music]

448.319 --> 451.319
yesterday

474.51 --> 482.759
[Music]

491.919 --> 497.19899999999996
what was my order that came the stand

493.68 --> 499.599
for my monitor expeditious truth cuz

497.199 --> 501.28000000000003
Nathan sent me like the screen but

499.599 --> 503.96
didn't have a

501.28 --> 505.71999999999997
stand so I had to order that separately

503.96 --> 508.23999999999995
and they basically delivered it like

505.72 --> 510.36
some kind of Ikea

508.24 --> 513.32
package

510.36 --> 516.24
and then the bolts are too big

513.32 --> 520.2
yay

516.24 --> 523.519
anyway this is like what I got so

520.2 --> 527.32
far it's like a three-part

523.519 --> 529.6
thing with this and I mean it is pretty

527.32 --> 533.08
cool but

529.6 --> 537.279
yeah if I can't attach the monitor to it

533.08 --> 537.279
properly it's that a lot of

538.2 --> 541.2
use

544.16 --> 549.079
all right

546.519 --> 552.12
because these

549.079 --> 555.68
bolts though not even that big really

552.12 --> 558.519
are like way too long I have to be like

555.68 --> 561.2399999999999
half the length of

558.519 --> 563.97
these otherwise it's it's like they just

561.24 --> 567.09
don't go in my

563.97 --> 567.09
[Music]

568.12 --> 575.2
Monitor

571.12 --> 580.88
your n say it started 10 hours ago

575.2 --> 580.88
what okay are you sure not 10 minutes

584.959 --> 590.06
ago anyway hello ter 306 good to see you

h

777.24 --> 784.12
oops Yeah no sound sorry I didn't

780.36 --> 784.12
notice thanks for telling

786.199 --> 791.04
me hello steamy traveler and Bill Knight

789.519 --> 794.12
the science

791.04 --> 797.079
denier I was just saying that like

794.12 --> 799.92
terr's got ter 306 has gone full

797.079 --> 802.8389999999999
astrology so now if there's

799.92 --> 806.36
anything about you I'm pretty damn sure

802.839 --> 810.7600000000001
that terot can figure out how you got

806.36 --> 810.76
that through astrology

813.76 --> 819.36
h ah YouTube keeps freezing my video for

817.12 --> 819.36
some

820.199 --> 826.3599999999999
reason only does that at the beginning

823.959 --> 828.8389999999999
though I'm

826.36 --> 831.1990000000001
noticing I don't know why it would do

828.839 --> 835.0790000000001
that why would it force me

831.199 --> 835.079
to refresh all the

837.759 --> 840.759
time

842.61 --> 846.289
[Music]

849.72 --> 856.09
[Music]

858.35 --> 866.259
[Music]

867.68 --> 870.68
Terry

877.47 --> 882.359
[Music]

891.519 --> 895.32
guess I guess that was that for the

896.37 --> 902.079
[Music]

897.68 --> 902.079
Sun a bunch of clouds are moving

909.63 --> 913.389
[Music]

916.89 --> 929.97
[Music]

927.6 --> 933.179
over

929.97 --> 933.179
[Music]

936.26 --> 939.45
[Music]

940.92 --> 947.199
wow that one really hit the

943.36 --> 950.399
spot I was really like almost going to

947.199 --> 950.399
eat it before the show

955.0 --> 960.6
but I feel so much better now

961.319 --> 966.639
I mean technically it is my breakfast

963.839 --> 971.3190000000001
unless you want to count supplements a

966.639 --> 971.319
bunch of pills not really that

977.92 --> 984.12
[Music]

980.48 --> 984.12
fulfilling right so

986.959 --> 992.7589999999999
yeah I was actually thinking of starting

990.0 --> 995.92
back up my toera coffee tradition on my

992.759 --> 998.36
show to try it out but only like I have

995.92 --> 1000.079
to be careful because if I like push it

998.36 --> 1001.839
like oh I got to get coffee when I just

1000.079 --> 1004.279
woke up or something it would make me

1001.839 --> 1004.2790000000001
sick

1005.279 --> 1011.759
guaranteed but I if I get up early

1008.199 --> 1016.3599999999999
enough in time

1011.759 --> 1016.36
basically then it shouldn't even be a

1017.48 --> 1024.48
problem and

1020.04 --> 1024.48
also I have really noticed

1025.48 --> 1031.48
that odly enough maybe the green tea

1029.0 --> 1034.959
that I was

1031.48 --> 1037.52
drinking was a worse influence than the

1034.959 --> 1041.64
coffee which is like really surprising

1037.52 --> 1044.48
to me because I expected a whole array

1041.64 --> 1049.0
of symptoms like to

1044.48 --> 1052.799
return by yeah drinking coffee again

1049.0 --> 1056.0
which I have now for like over a

1052.799 --> 1057.6399999999999
week and some of the days even having

1056.0 --> 1061.2
two cups of

1057.64 --> 1064.2
coffee right it's like oh how dare you

1061.2 --> 1064.2
arein

1066.52 --> 1071.9189999999999
but those symptoms that I typically

1069.16 --> 1076.0
Associated didn't really come back or

1071.919 --> 1077.4
even start up a couple of things did

1076.0 --> 1083.52
typical

1077.4 --> 1083.52
inflammation uh pylon right a

1084.08 --> 1089.8799999999999
pylon any inflammation situation just

1087.08 --> 1091.799
becomes slightly more but I mean that's

1089.88 --> 1095.48
that's just

1091.799 --> 1099.2
caffeine it will do

1095.48 --> 1102.76
that it will aggravate things a

1099.2 --> 1106.4
little but I had all these other

1102.76 --> 1110.26
issues like stomach issues and

1106.4 --> 1112.3200000000002
especially my stomach man I really got

1110.26 --> 1115.28
[Music]

1112.32 --> 1118.52
and they haven't come back so maybe it

1115.28 --> 1121.44
really was the green tea because I had

1118.52 --> 1123.6399999999999
been drinking that for years like a lot

1121.44 --> 1123.64
of

1128.76 --> 1137.32
it but I quit doing that and I think

1133.52 --> 1139.52
that might have been the problem after

1137.32 --> 1142.24
all

1139.52 --> 1145.08
anyway I'm going to keep going because I

1142.24 --> 1149.559
am enjoying the coffee actually and not

1145.08 --> 1153.12
getting sick of it not getting like oh a

1149.559 --> 1158.08
acid reflux or something

1153.12 --> 1158.08
annoying so yeah it's

1159.28 --> 1164.2
great there's more caffeine in tea than

1163.28 --> 1167.08
in

1164.2 --> 1169.48
coffee

1167.08 --> 1173.76
maybe why whatever it

1169.48 --> 1176.0
is I used to drink a lot of green tea

1173.76 --> 1178.52
and that's the big difference I drank so

1176.0 --> 1178.52
much of

1179.76 --> 1186.919
it right like

1183.0 --> 1186.919
three pots a

1191.6 --> 1200.3999999999999
day which we would be like 10 or more

1196.679 --> 1203.3200000000002
cups or something like that or way more

1200.4 --> 1204.72
actually yeah maybe like 20 I don't know

1203.32 --> 1207.96
a lot of

1204.72 --> 1211.1200000000001
it and I guess I really underestimated

1207.96 --> 1213.1200000000001
the influence of it but I'm very happy

1211.12 --> 1216.6789999999999
that I switched the

1213.12 --> 1219.559
minty it's much more

1216.679 --> 1224.52
soothing and apparently if I yeah have

1219.559 --> 1224.52
coffee uh on the side it works

1225.919 --> 1230.96
great and it does actually really wake

1229.0 --> 1234.919
me up I've

1230.96 --> 1237.559
noticed so yesterday for example like

1234.919 --> 1239.2800000000002
I'm now drinking I used to like oh I end

1237.559 --> 1242.52
the early bir show and then I take a

1239.28 --> 1246.12
beer right and then just kind of like

1242.52 --> 1248.84
sit back have a bit of fun maybe maybe

1246.12 --> 1251.4399999999998
get get involved but sometimes mess up

1248.84 --> 1254.52
also because of

1251.44 --> 1257.039
that now I drink coffee and I actually

1254.52 --> 1257.039
get really

1257.12 --> 1261.12
sharp

1258.919 --> 1266.0
that's the big

1261.12 --> 1266.0
difference so yeah I've been basic

1271.96 --> 1279.4
yeah rearranging basic diet like basic

1277.2 --> 1282.2
basic diet

1279.4 --> 1286.3600000000001
like I'm poor so it's not like I have

1282.2 --> 1286.3600000000001
all these exotic diet things or

1287.039 --> 1292.24
whatever

1289.559 --> 1296.72
but just rearranging your diet in a very

1292.24 --> 1298.76
basic way can show you that you think

1296.72 --> 1301.2
something has an influence but it turns

1298.76 --> 1302.64
out that something else might have been

1301.2 --> 1306.1200000000001
having that influence and you just

1302.64 --> 1308.1200000000001
didn't see it and you find out by

1306.12 --> 1311.3999999999999
testing all these things and basically

1308.12 --> 1313.2399999999998
like retracting a habit and not like oh

1311.4 --> 1316.2
I got to quit permanently because of the

1313.24 --> 1319.44
not with judgment but just like I got to

1316.2 --> 1322.919
stop doing it to see if it makes a

1319.44 --> 1326.3200000000002
difference to see what it was actually

1322.919 --> 1329.3200000000002
doing right it's like recombine your

1326.32 --> 1332.1589999999999
habits until you just know

1329.32 --> 1333.48
like I wasn't sure what was causing all

1332.159 --> 1336.4
those

1333.48 --> 1338.919
issues that with my stomach and which in

1336.4 --> 1341.3600000000001
extremities would even express to my

1338.919 --> 1343.8400000000001
skin some of you might remember like

1341.36 --> 1346.799
even the Flat Earth talks days I had

1343.84 --> 1349.8799999999999
some pretty Dam bad skin

1346.799 --> 1350.679
issues and I thought that's because of

1349.88 --> 1353.96
the

1350.679 --> 1356.96
coffee but the coffee what it m mainly

1353.96 --> 1360.159
did was just inflame it in the moment

1356.96 --> 1364.159
when I just drank it so it aggravated

1360.159 --> 1367.3200000000002
what the the skin issue itself like

1364.159 --> 1372.44
sense of it

1367.32 --> 1372.4399999999998
but it wasn't actually the cause of

1376.039 --> 1381.039
it so by

1378.72 --> 1383.32
having all that retracted and some of it

1381.039 --> 1385.32
might not even have been like chemical

1383.32 --> 1386.799
in origin some of it simply might have

1385.32 --> 1389.0
been German new

1386.799 --> 1392.24
medicine

1389.0 --> 1395.559
trauma resolution responses from the

1392.24 --> 1396.84
body because of past things I mean

1395.559 --> 1400.36
that's literally what German new

1396.84 --> 1401.559
medicine says so you can just get sick

1400.36 --> 1403.8799999999999
it's not because of something you're

1401.559 --> 1407.279
eating or whatever in that moment it is

1403.88 --> 1409.0
because you've just completed a

1407.279 --> 1412.96
resolution

1409.0 --> 1415.08
in your heart basically

1412.96 --> 1417.96
like the

1415.08 --> 1420.1589999999999
subconscious finally managed to

1417.96 --> 1423.0
resolve a

1420.159 --> 1425.919
trauma which might have completely

1423.0 --> 1428.64
bypassed the Consciousness

1425.919 --> 1431.8400000000001
even like it doesn't necessarily have to

1428.64 --> 1436.48
be the Consciousness

1431.84 --> 1436.48
itself that is at at the root of

1436.88 --> 1442.4
it

1439.64 --> 1445.279
like because you can underestimate the

1442.4 --> 1448.88
impact of influences consciously and

1445.279 --> 1452.4
then downplay it and forget about it yet

1448.88 --> 1454.24
the impact might last like very long and

1452.4 --> 1456.5590000000002
have an

1454.24 --> 1458.559
influence and then when you resolve it

1456.559 --> 1464.039
when it's done when the trauma is

1458.559 --> 1464.039
resolved when you fixed it then you get

1464.399 --> 1471.1999999999998
sick because it's finally the sick part

1468.159 --> 1474.159
when you actually get the sick is the

1471.2 --> 1478.039
cleaning up after it's like that's when

1474.159 --> 1479.679
it's actually done it's like German new

1478.039 --> 1483.2
medicine and my healer especially

1479.679 --> 1486.48
because he's and my dad helped me a lot

1483.2 --> 1488.76
by understanding it is that this the

1486.48 --> 1491.6
disease really isn't the

1488.76 --> 1494.8799999999999
issue it is what comes

1491.6 --> 1497.799
out of the issue it's like when you

1494.88 --> 1500.7600000000002
notice real symptoms when you're sick

1497.799 --> 1503.039
that actually means it's already

1500.76 --> 1505.039
finished so

1503.039 --> 1507.44
it's you

1505.039 --> 1509.64
shouldn't you shouldn't think about it

1507.44 --> 1511.76
as like oh no there's something

1509.64 --> 1515.44
happening right now no it's actually

1511.76 --> 1517.919
something has happened and now it's just

1515.44 --> 1517.919
cleaning

1518.96 --> 1524.6000000000001
up so that you don't impose all this is

1522.2 --> 1527.159
just practical practical like so that

1524.6 --> 1529.279
you don't impose some kind of like

1527.159 --> 1531.48
fantasy about oh it's going to go out of

1529.279 --> 1535.08
control and who knows how that you don't

1531.48 --> 1537.84
stress yourself out which like

1535.08 --> 1540.48
provably makes any kind of disease

1537.84 --> 1540.48
situation

1549.88 --> 1556.679
worse you like

1552.12 --> 1559.6789999999999
coffee work hard I get jittery yeah fair

1556.679 --> 1559.679
enough

1560.159 --> 1567.48
now if you drink coffee when you're like

1562.64 --> 1567.48
bored then that's really screws you

1567.76 --> 1571.799
up it just makes me agitated and all

1570.24 --> 1574.039
that but if there's like something

1571.799 --> 1574.039
you're

1575.159 --> 1581.279
doing or especially if there's something

1577.44 --> 1581.279
you're working on then it's

1584.399 --> 1588.2399999999998
great right it's like it helps to focus

1587.0 --> 1590.279
but there has to be something that

1588.24 --> 1593.679
you're actually focusing on otherwise

1590.279 --> 1593.679
it's going to backfire on

1603.88 --> 1611.279
you tea helped stop the rampid

1607.039 --> 1611.279
alcoholism in okay clutch that's

1616.6 --> 1619.6
interesting

1620.76 --> 1627.72
and it is in a way kind of weird

1623.84 --> 1630.84
because I stopped drinking tea before I

1627.72 --> 1630.84
stopped drinking

1639.559 --> 1644.12
alcohol right but I mean I never really

1641.88 --> 1644.1200000000001
had

1646.52 --> 1649.52
alcoholism

1649.88 --> 1655.5200000000002
because it's like I'm too sensitive to

1652.279 --> 1658.48
alcohol to be a real

1655.52 --> 1662.6399999999999
alcoholic right I'd have to be like very

1658.48 --> 1662.64
depressed to really be like an

1663.44 --> 1668.0
alcoholic and I'm not I'm not letting

1665.76 --> 1668.0
that

1674.48 --> 1679.519
happen sugar makes pain yeah

1686.36 --> 1691.6789999999999
right yeah Bill night sign and if you

1688.159 --> 1695.519
want to you could try to like

1691.679 --> 1695.519
really ingest some

1696.72 --> 1704.76
tumeric it might help the problem if

1699.799 --> 1707.2
it's like a joint issue or even muscle

1704.76 --> 1710.84
issue and that's part of the weird thing

1707.2 --> 1713.0800000000002
too is that well I drink my coffee to

1710.84 --> 1716.6
Maric coffee right you might have

1713.08 --> 1718.48
forgotten but it's actually for me a way

1716.6 --> 1722.799
to ingest a lot of

1718.48 --> 1726.0
turmeric cuz I I take like a spoon of it

1722.799 --> 1729.279
it's like quite a quite an amount of

1726.0 --> 1733.679
turmeric I put in there and for some

1729.279 --> 1736.72
reason like the coffee does like amplify

1733.679 --> 1738.1200000000001
it that's so and it's really funny to me

1736.72 --> 1740.2
because it's like

1738.12 --> 1744.0
like are turmeric

1740.2 --> 1746.519
and coffee supposed to be used together

1744.0 --> 1746.519
is my

1746.679 --> 1752.48
question like and black pepper right

1750.44 --> 1755.48
black pepper

1752.48 --> 1755.48
turmeric

1755.72 --> 1761.799
coffee like because they are pretty much

1758.6 --> 1765.0
from the same type of regions

1761.799 --> 1766.32
right was it where did the Coffee Bean

1765.0 --> 1769.32
originate

1766.32 --> 1769.32
from

1771.24 --> 1776.519
did it come from

1773.519 --> 1778.96
India or did it come from like South

1776.519 --> 1780.72
America or something I know the potatoes

1778.96 --> 1784.159
come from

1780.72 --> 1786.44
America from what I heard what I learned

1784.159 --> 1790.919
in

1786.44 --> 1793.039
school is it not South yeah could be but

1790.919 --> 1796.519
yeah maybe they're not like from the

1793.039 --> 1798.6
original same grounds but I have found

1796.519 --> 1800.08
that in my my experience they work out

1798.6 --> 1802.36
great together

1800.08 --> 1806.8799999999999
like

1802.36 --> 1810.7199999999998
coffee and then like you take a typical

1806.88 --> 1812.3990000000001
cup like scoop of coffee like I take

1810.72 --> 1816.279
like one and a half to

1812.399 --> 1818.8799999999999
two and then you add a little a little

1816.279 --> 1822.32
teaspoon like a little

1818.88 --> 1824.8400000000001
teaspoon what I mean a a a big scoop

1822.32 --> 1826.6789999999999
with the little teaspoon on top of that

1824.84 --> 1830.279
and just mix it in and that yeah that

1826.679 --> 1833.3200000000002
turmeric is already like uh what is it

1830.279 --> 1835.44
10 to 20% black pepper that's already

1833.32 --> 1839.6
mixed in the tumeric

1835.44 --> 1839.6000000000001
standard and it just works great

1840.799 --> 1846.799
together they say Ethiopia coffee origin

1847.84 --> 1850.84
H

1854.679 --> 1861.5590000000002
okay that's funny I guess that

1857.919 --> 1861.5590000000002
well then it's like a three kings

1862.08 --> 1865.08
situation

1866.12 --> 1870.36
Peru Ethiopia and

1886.159 --> 1892.96
India anyway I I just like

1890.24 --> 1895.76
coffee it does taste different though I

1892.96 --> 1898.159
mean there will be plenty of people out

1895.76 --> 1900.1589999999999
there that are like how dare you Arwin

1898.159 --> 1903.24
how dare you throw in this

1900.159 --> 1904.3200000000002
dirty dirty Indian spices is they're

1903.24 --> 1908.279
ruining

1904.32 --> 1910.639
it I want my coffee black or with cream

1908.279 --> 1912.519
or something I don't even know what

1910.639 --> 1916.1589999999999
turmeric coffee would be like if you

1912.519 --> 1918.039
added cream a weird

1916.159 --> 1920.679
idea

1918.039 --> 1924.44
but yeah it does absolutely like

1920.679 --> 1927.3600000000001
dramatically change the taste though but

1924.44 --> 1929.6000000000001
I like it I like the combination it's I

1927.36 --> 1933.08
I think it's better I think that just

1929.6 --> 1935.36
Bland coffee is just mostly

1933.08 --> 1939.039
bitter and I'm

1935.36 --> 1942.4399999999998
like if you just take the coffee like

1939.039 --> 1945.639
even the very mild ones I'm like yeah I

1942.44 --> 1949.0800000000002
don't actually like the taste of coffee

1945.639 --> 1951.639
okay I don't actually like it but if

1949.08 --> 1954.96
it's like combined with a bunch of

1951.639 --> 1956.799
things like with at minimum some sugar

1954.96 --> 1960.279
then it's like

1956.799 --> 1963.44
doable and the turmeric makes it

1960.279 --> 1963.44
better I

1970.72 --> 1979.039
think keep America away from your coffee

1974.919 --> 1979.039
dude yeah seeing star water

1985.639 --> 1988.4399999999998
cocaine and

2001.48 --> 2008.96
mummies weird facts it's

2005.96 --> 2008.96
fine

2013.32 --> 2019.039
but I mean it is you know what is extra

2015.84 --> 2021.72
weird about it clutch allegedly weird

2019.039 --> 2024.559
not really that weird is that if

2021.72 --> 2027.88
supposedly Egyptian monies had cocaine

2024.559 --> 2029.12
in them like I don't even know how the

2027.88 --> 2032.1200000000001
hell that would have

2029.12 --> 2036.279
worked like

2032.12 --> 2038.399
what but like that cocaine plant's not

2036.279 --> 2041.039
exactly in Egyptian

2038.399 --> 2043.4799999999998
plant if you know what I

2041.039 --> 2047.799
mean so that would have already proved

2043.48 --> 2049.56
that like yeah oh they disco discovered

2047.799 --> 2053.639
America yeah

2049.56 --> 2057.839
right when the Egyptians just had like

2053.639 --> 2061.2400000000002
coca plants it's surprising that if they

2057.839 --> 2063.7599999999998
had that kind of stuff that they

2061.24 --> 2065.879
hadn't figured out

2063.76 --> 2068.8790000000004
potatoes

2065.879 --> 2068.879
sooner

2069.48 --> 2078.119
right or or were the potatoes being

2074.359 --> 2080.639
discovered during the uh what is

2078.119 --> 2083.079
it during the

2080.639 --> 2085.32
colonization is that maybe just a

2083.079 --> 2087.9190000000003
[ __ ] story that the potatoes were

2085.32 --> 2091.04
just around way earlier than

2087.919 --> 2094.2
that I

2091.04 --> 2095.879
wonder because I was always very fond of

2094.2 --> 2099.68
the potato

2095.879 --> 2101.88
story from that I did learn in school

2099.68 --> 2105.2799999999997
and all that but like oh they went there

2101.88 --> 2107.48
and then oh they tried the potato

2105.28 --> 2109.92
berries and then a lot of them died and

2107.48 --> 2112.44
they're like oh terrible plan it's evil

2109.92 --> 2115.96
how dare they and throw it on the

2112.44 --> 2118.28
fire and then somebody pokes around in a

2115.96 --> 2121.2
stick and then looks that like an actual

2118.28 --> 2124.6800000000003
potato and it's like oh white and

2121.2 --> 2128.16
yellowy and huh what is that and he

2124.68 --> 2132.56
tries it and it's like wao this is great

2128.16 --> 2132.56
and it turn out no you you don't eat the

2133.599 --> 2140.119
berries you eat the what do you even

2137.64 --> 2140.1189999999997
call that

2145.0 --> 2149.599
Roots I don't sure up where it say

2151.81 --> 2154.96
[Music]

2155.8 --> 2163.48
here

2158.599 --> 2163.48
how do you call that what is a freaking

2166.28 --> 2170.8390000000004
potato I don't know how to search this

2182.52 --> 2187.72
see right but it's not a root but it's

2185.92 --> 2192.839
something like a

2187.72 --> 2196.7999999999997
rude could you guys help me out

2192.839 --> 2196.7999999999997
please going to get your

2198.079 --> 2201.079
attention

2201.16 --> 2204.8799999999997
T is that what it's

2205.16 --> 2212.04
called

2207.48 --> 2212.04
serious I've never heard that word

2212.319 --> 2218.68
before that is weird Okay so potatoes

2215.48 --> 2218.68
are tubers

2223.72 --> 2232.9599999999996
why you Tu like it's nothing like oh

2230.04 --> 2235.56
whatever it's a tuber I guess now I

2232.96 --> 2237.4
completely lost track of my thought like

2235.56 --> 2240.04
why I even wanted to know

2237.4 --> 2242.359
that oh yeah it was about the potato

2240.04 --> 2243.8
story and then how would they came from

2242.359 --> 2247.68
South

2243.8 --> 2251.2000000000003
America that they were poisoned by it by

2247.68 --> 2251.2
well is that

2252.52 --> 2258.599
real or has the potato been around much

2255.88 --> 2262.92
longer I don't

2258.599 --> 2265.76
know it came in in a time when there

2262.92 --> 2268.2400000000002
there was like decent registry and all

2265.76 --> 2271.48
that so I guess that maybe it is

2268.24 --> 2272.9599999999996
historically deducible from like trade

2271.48 --> 2278.599
records and all

2272.96 --> 2278.599
that which were actually happening

2282.96 --> 2288.599
I don't know what do you guys

2284.56 --> 2291.0
think was the potato really discovered

2288.599 --> 2295.079
during the colonization

2291.0 --> 2299.24
era by Europeans or would it have been

2295.079 --> 2299.2400000000002
around for a

2304.04 --> 2311.64
millennium it's not a tuba

2307.599 --> 2311.6400000000003
uh okay fair enough George

2312.8 --> 2319.44
sford by the way George you really you

2316.64 --> 2320.359
make some shitty comments sometimes on

2319.44 --> 2324.56
my

2320.359 --> 2324.56
show I don't know why you do

2327.839 --> 2333.599
that why why you acting like a baller

[Music]

4210.56 --> 4215.88
all right anyway glad everybody's all

4213.08 --> 4220.159
here I

4215.88 --> 4222.64
a not particularly inspired at the

4220.159 --> 4225.639999999999
moment although yeah

4222.64 --> 4225.64
this

4227.92 --> 4233.1990000000005
zaratustra it is

4230.84 --> 4238.2390000000005
interesting cuz arguably like this is

4233.199 --> 4241.639999999999
where like all of monotheism basically

4238.239 --> 4243.199
started and like this is such a freaking

4241.64 --> 4246.719
long time ago

4243.199 --> 4246.719
it's it's just

4252.64 --> 4255.64
surreal

4265.84 --> 4270.92
there just something really surreal

4267.679 --> 4270.92
about the whole

4274.43 --> 4277.759
[Music]

4282.56 --> 4285.56
religion

4312.56 --> 4315.56
for

4342.48 --> 4345.48
for

4347.6 --> 4358.939
hey J good to see

4349.52 --> 4358.939

Lord

4422.84 --> 4426.92
I don't know what it is today for me

4425.199 --> 4430.5199999999995
it's just not

4426.92 --> 4433.719
working yesterday was super fluid and

4430.52 --> 4436.84
today it's like there's something intern

4433.719 --> 4436.84
just not

4459.84 --> 4466.32
right maybe it was the Illuminati C

4463.36 --> 4468.08
sounds weird though and what it not so

4466.32 --> 4471.96
nice to

4468.08 --> 4471.96
eat I don't know what it

4474.24 --> 4479.96
[Music]

4477.36 --> 4482.679
is maybe it's my body's revenge for

4479.96 --> 4482.679
getting up in

4484.22 --> 4489.719
[Music]

4486.0 --> 4492.84
time I really need to make more effort

4489.719 --> 4495.6
to actually go to bed in time but it's

4492.84 --> 4497.159000000001
like a it's like a dealing with a little

4495.6 --> 4499.639
kid

4497.159 --> 4501.44
sometimes at night because it just like

4499.639 --> 4505.76
gets

4501.44 --> 4508.12
so like bullish that just like no I want

4505.76 --> 4512.71
to go to bed when the [ __ ] sun comes

4508.12 --> 4515.48
up like I don't even know why that

4512.71 --> 4518.76
[Music]

4515.48 --> 4522.4
happens it really is like a

4518.76 --> 4525.56
demon like as Owen talks about it it's

4522.4 --> 4528.08
just like I need to get control over

4525.56 --> 4531.0
myself and make it stop wasting my

4528.08 --> 4531.0
[ __ ] time at

4536.159 --> 4541.92
night no I did not eat it of a lead

4538.88 --> 4541.92
plate very funny

4545.48 --> 4548.62
[Music]

4552.199 --> 4555.199
o

4582.12 --> 4585.12
h

4590.88 --> 4596.76
I don't know what it

4593.4 --> 4600.839999999999
is maybe an overall lack of

4596.76 --> 4603.12
Salt N I doubt it I don't think this

4600.84 --> 4605.6
salt actually helps this now I could

4603.12 --> 4608.76
just feel it like now there's sort some

4605.6 --> 4610.8
sort of like acid situation in my

4608.76 --> 4612.84
stomach but I don't understand how it

4610.8 --> 4614.88
got triggered because it that wasn't

4612.84 --> 4617.12
there

4614.88 --> 4619.4800000000005
when I started the show at all I felt

4617.12 --> 4621.8
great when I started the

4619.48 --> 4625.239
show and then it's some point it was

4621.8 --> 4629.76
just click and it's like oh

4625.239 --> 4629.759999999999
[ __ ] how did it get there I don't get

4642.0 --> 4645.0
it

4650.719 --> 4657.84
because when I that effect happens it

4654.52 --> 4659.8
also kind of disrupts my

4657.84 --> 4663.12
concentration it's

4659.8 --> 4665.96
a often a big contributor to Long

4663.12 --> 4668.48
silences it's because like my stomach

4665.96 --> 4671.28
feels wrong and it

4668.48 --> 4673.36
just makes everything more difficult

4671.28 --> 4675.719
it's basically my freaking body just

4673.36 --> 4678.12
telling me like hey Arn's really cute

4675.719 --> 4680.28
and all that but like just [ __ ] turn

4678.12 --> 4684.76
off the show and do something

4680.28 --> 4688.4
else like it is in some

4684.76 --> 4690.159000000001
way it's like there's something about

4688.4 --> 4692.199
like the interaction energies or

4690.159 --> 4694.159
something that sometimes it just really

4692.199 --> 4696.44
doesn't agree with me and it's like my

4694.159 --> 4698.638999999999
her inner hermit that's just like okay

4696.44 --> 4702.5199999999995
I'm going to [ __ ] you up until you

4698.639 --> 4703.719
[ __ ] leave everything alone like

4702.52 --> 4706.4800000000005
basically

4703.719 --> 4708.199
like subconsciously wanting to be alone

4706.48 --> 4710.0
or something I don't know what the [ __ ]

4708.199 --> 4713.12
that

4710.0 --> 4716.12
is or it's like I don't want the

4713.12 --> 4718.239
attention cuz I never have any type of

4716.12 --> 4720.28
issue like this on fed I might get

4718.239 --> 4722.159
agitated when they like tell me to shut

4720.28 --> 4725.12
up or

4722.159 --> 4728.239
whatever but it is like having the

4725.12 --> 4731.32
actual attention on me because I am

4728.239 --> 4734.919999999999
literally on camera on the show it's so

4731.32 --> 4734.92
it's a different thing

4736.48 --> 4743.44
it's a whole another

4738.88 --> 4743.4400000000005
level as just being a participant

4750.92 --> 4755.4
somewhere and in a way it is kind of

4753.12 --> 4755.4
like a

4756.04 --> 4761.12
burden and

4758.159 --> 4763.44
then yeah it's it's sometimes just

4761.12 --> 4765.199
tricky balancing it out like

4763.44 --> 4767.4
because it works great when I really

4765.199 --> 4769.678999999999
want to go introspective and talk about

4767.4 --> 4772.48
details or like the experience of things

4769.679 --> 4776.88
as I'm literally doing about it right

4772.48 --> 4779.239
now but in other times it's just like I

4776.88 --> 4782.32
wish it wouldn't just continually make

4779.239 --> 4787.48
such a freaking impact all the

4782.32 --> 4787.48
time if could just stay simple and

4788.48 --> 4795.44
not so that it could just be more

4791.84 --> 4798.56
casual and keep yapping yeah but then

4795.44 --> 4801.32
yeah no it can't work I just have to be

4798.56 --> 4804.2390000000005
the freaking way that I am I am like

4801.32 --> 4806.599999999999
Arwin and I do it like me and it means

4804.239 --> 4809.959999999999
freaking silence for giant amounts of

4806.6 --> 4813.52
time and then something potentially

4809.96 --> 4815.12
interesting and not blah blah blah blah

4813.52 --> 4818.400000000001
blah blah

4815.12 --> 4822.4
blah keep on talking about almost

4818.4 --> 4824.32
nothing that's something I I despise

4822.4 --> 4828.04
like I can't do

4824.32 --> 4831.199
it it makes me physically want to

4828.04 --> 4836.239
freaking torture myself if I catch

4831.199 --> 4836.239
myself doing that I hate useless

4838.84 --> 4844.88
waffling but yeah long silences kind of

4842.04 --> 4846.04
make me uncomfortable so I'm kind of

4844.88 --> 4848.52
caught

4846.04 --> 4850.6
there between a rock and a hard place

4848.52 --> 4854.719
you could

4850.6 --> 4854.719
say what the hell do you do with it

4857.05 --> 4862.400000000001
[Music]

4859.84 --> 4866.1990000000005
I think the moment's passing a

4862.4 --> 4869.159
bit sometimes it's also just like hey I

4866.199 --> 4871.839999999999
feel terrible the experience of me

4869.159 --> 4874.4
feeling terrible seems almost like its

4871.84 --> 4878.159000000001
own freaking microc Consciousness that

4874.4 --> 4880.679
just wants to be known like something

4878.159 --> 4885.638999999999
inside of me just wants everybody to

4880.679 --> 4885.639
know hey hey I am suddenly feeling

4885.76 --> 4891.159000000001
terrible and if it's just shared like

4889.08 --> 4895.8
hey I feel terrible all of a sudden and

4891.159 --> 4898.12
I can't pinpoint even why and then maybe

4895.8 --> 4900.4400000000005
it becomes less or something or it goes

4898.12 --> 4902.719
away

4900.44 --> 4907.12
I it's

4902.719 --> 4911.0
just I really wish I was just

4907.12 --> 4911.0
stable and it didn't

4911.4 --> 4916.5599999999995
happen but yeah then I wouldn't be a

4914.44 --> 4918.879999999999
person like this I wouldn't be

4916.56 --> 4922.320000000001
sensitive but I mean being sensitive

4918.88 --> 4924.76
just really [ __ ] sucks at times it

4922.32 --> 4924.759999999999
just

4926.76 --> 4931.1990000000005
sucks you just want to be still but you

4929.52 --> 4933.080000000001
can't be still because you're always

4931.199 --> 4935.599999999999
wobbling around because you're so

4933.08 --> 4935.6

4941.56 --> 4944.56
sensitive

everything is still happening the way it

5392.679 --> 5399.56
does I don't understand it I don't get

5396.8 --> 5402.719
why it's happening like this why people

5399.56 --> 5405.6

this

5431.44 --> 5436.638999999999
it's like at this point I want a

5433.56 --> 5440.84
business plan I want to see a business

5436.639 --> 5443.639
plan of steps to take to literally get

War I know they are they're pushing it

5551.8 --> 5555.639
they just want everything to go violent

5553.96 --> 5558.92
and then they hope that they can REM

5555.639 --> 5561.8
maneuver everything thanks to that and

5558.92 --> 5563.28
they will [ __ ] die in the process

5561.8 --> 5565.719
there's plenty of people that are going

5563.28 --> 5568.84
to make sure of

5565.719 --> 5570.0
it yeah there's not a [ __ ] person in

the

5591.04 --> 5596.92
anymore you're lucky if you end up in

5593.96 --> 5596.92

[Music]

5613.04 --> 5618.32
and yes I'm talking about [ __ ]

5615.119 --> 5619.799999999999
politicians and not some race that kind

5618.32 --> 5624.719
of hor

5619.8 --> 5627.320000000001
[ __ ] I'm talking about political

5624.719 --> 5629.28
conspirators a lot of rich

5627.32 --> 5633.49
people they

5629.28 --> 5635.4
are there's no poor person doing

5633.49 --> 5639.36
[Music]

5635.4 --> 5643.839999999999
this and even worse

5639.36 --> 5646.719
people that do this despise poor

5643.84 --> 5652.01
people they despise

5646.719 --> 5654.32
them they think that you're poor because

5652.01 --> 5656.320000000001
[Music]

5654.32 --> 5659.799999999999
you're

5656.32 --> 5663.96
yeah you've fallen out you're

5659.8 --> 5667.4800000000005
like only the degenerate become poor

5663.96 --> 5667.4800000000005
because if you're

5667.56 --> 5672.4400000000005
evolved then you should know how to have

5671.0 --> 5676.52
all that

5672.44 --> 5680.599999999999
right to cling to like for example

5676.52 --> 5683.400000000001
morality they would see as it's just

5680.6 --> 5687.76
oldfashioned

5683.4 --> 5690.759999999999
it's like we we we've they think they've

5687.76 --> 5692.96
evolved Beyond morality and they think

5690.76 --> 5698.04
that they can evolve morality and that's

5692.96 --> 5701.0
what this this mutant of shw

5698.04 --> 5703.44
lore and all that the way of thinking

5701.0 --> 5705.76
that's what that that's that they think

5703.44 --> 5707.638999999999
that they know better that that you can

5705.76 --> 5710.0
change

5707.639 --> 5714.2390000000005
morality it just turns you into a

5710.0 --> 5714.239
psychotic Maniac though in

5715.08 --> 5720.08
reality it's unbalanced and very

5717.84 --> 5723.08
restless on the

5720.08 --> 5725.04
inside because you're no longer attuned

5723.08 --> 5728.88
to

5725.04 --> 5733.159
reality no longer attuned to how things

5728.88 --> 5736.0
are because they are the way they

5733.159 --> 5738.839999999999
are and nothing changes that and if it

5736.0 --> 5741.96
all went away and then grew back it

5738.84 --> 5744.76
would become that way again because that

5741.96 --> 5746.44
is the way it is it's how things are

5744.76 --> 5749.6
designed it's how things naturally

5746.44 --> 5752.5599999999995
develop it's what happens every

5749.6 --> 5755.360000000001
time natural

5752.56 --> 5755.360000000001
they don't want

5762.92 --> 5772.4800000000005
natural but all who do that they all end

5767.08 --> 5773.43
up like completely killed or mutated or

5772.48 --> 5776.978999999999
just

5773.43 --> 5776.979
[Music]

5779.159 --> 5783.679
gone turn to grabler and then they turn

5782.159 --> 5786.0
into

5783.679 --> 5789.08
Oblivion right so I'm going to round out

5786.0 --> 5793.52
now because just nobody is doing

5789.08 --> 5796.44
anything in this chat and I'm sick of it

5793.52 --> 5798.4400000000005

eating and all

5860.28 --> 5866.199
that that would be

5863.4 --> 5869.04
great and maybe then I'd be less

5866.199 --> 5869.04
restless and all

5869.76 --> 5874.96
that maybe I know I would be if I

5873.199 --> 5876.41
wouldn't have Financial issues and I

5874.96 --> 5877.84
wouldn't be stressed out at
