it was it's been kind of rainy

77.2 --> 83.52000000000001
most of the night and the evening and

80.479 --> 86.0
it's really glad i got groceries early

83.52 --> 88.79899999999999
yesterday because like after

86.0 --> 89.68
that point it just kept on raining and

88.799 --> 93.119
raining

89.68 --> 93.119
right now it looks pretty nice

95.759 --> 101.52
and yeah it's not windy it's a little

99.36 --> 105.2
bit of sun here and there

101.52 --> 105.2
it's still kind of cold though

108.32 --> 110.92999999999999
that's what i'm still wearing on my my

110.24 --> 112.15899999999999
sweater

110.93 --> 114.399
[Music]

112.159 --> 118.24000000000001
because like getting outside in the

114.399 --> 118.24
t-shirt now is just too much

118.56 --> 128.64000000000001
anyway ah i see michael rook is first

124.32 --> 131.44
hello i think good servant should be

128.64 --> 133.44
coming in any second now because i just

131.44 --> 135.44
turned off skype because i heard all the

133.44 --> 142.4
notifications which means

135.44 --> 146.239
it's usually him uh hey martin telberg

142.4 --> 146.239
yeah i got green tea with me

147.68 --> 151.20000000000002
uh there he is good servant

151.68 --> 157.84
so i finally managed to start the show

154.4 --> 157.84
on time

159.68 --> 162.31900000000002
how about that

165.04 --> 170.4
right and i made some notes i yeah this

167.92 --> 173.599
this time i actually got up

170.4 --> 173.59900000000002
even before 12

174.239 --> 177.76
and yeah i was thinking about what i was

176.8 --> 181.20000000000002
doing now

177.76 --> 183.599
before i started the show

181.2 --> 185.83999999999997
so i don't have to waste time trying to

183.599 --> 187.76
remember that

185.84 --> 189.76
although i might get flustered again it

187.76 --> 190.79999999999998
it does often happen at the start of the

189.76 --> 194.64
show

190.8 --> 196.31900000000002
right but i made pretty pretty extensive

194.64 --> 200.319
notes

196.319 --> 202.79999999999998
no big bear yesterday i watched some

200.319 --> 202.79999999999998
movies

203.12 --> 211.28
oh yeah and brian

206.64 --> 214.72
forster had a live show

211.28 --> 216.08
another historical presentation this

214.72 --> 219.44
time

216.08 --> 220.56
ancient egyptian sites and his ideas

219.44 --> 223.44
about it

220.56 --> 223.44
quite interesting

223.84 --> 229.28
and i was there live in chat or at least

226.319 --> 231.04
it was a premiere it wasn't him

229.28 --> 232.879
but he was there live in chat and was

231.04 --> 234.4
interesting and managed to put out some

232.879 --> 237.28
of my own ideas

234.4 --> 237.28
i typically do

237.76 --> 243.439
and this morning i got a by the way

239.84 --> 243.439
brand m good to see you in chat

243.92 --> 248.23899999999998
i got a link from good servant

251.28 --> 256.959
to a video that was all about

254.319 --> 256.959
verbiage

259.919 --> 269.84
hey hold on wrong link

270.08 --> 277.84
right bible code jesus is my name

274.479 --> 283.75899999999996
and it was interesting video thanks for

277.84 --> 297.84
sharing that

283.759 --> 297.84000000000003
put the link out in chat

299.44 --> 302.71999999999997
what idea was that

303.28 --> 324.96
hello mo right

311.199 --> 328.16
hold on

324.96 --> 331.84
how it all lines up well yes

328.16 --> 335.12
from that approach definitely

331.84 --> 336.88
it just goes to show that the fun what i

335.12 --> 339.6
what stood the most out to me in that

336.88 --> 342.8
video is that what he was describing

339.6 --> 344.88
about it was

342.8 --> 346.72
yeah pretty much kind of what i've been

344.88 --> 349.759
saying from an

346.72 --> 351.44000000000005
esoteric perspective that kind of blew

349.759 --> 354.8
me away

351.44 --> 358.16
basically saying like yeah it is that

354.8 --> 361.12
that enigmatic

358.16 --> 362.88000000000005
thing about the story of jesus it's it's

361.12 --> 366.16
like this this piece of magic that's

362.88 --> 370.319
been encapsulated

366.16 --> 372.56
by the yeah by the religion

370.319 --> 373.68
which is like an institute and opposes

372.56 --> 375.919
jesus and

373.68 --> 376.88
well he didn't go into detail about that

375.919 --> 379.12
but he pretty much

376.88 --> 380.71999999999997
lined that out and that and that really

379.12 --> 383.36
blew me away

380.72 --> 384.96000000000004
like damn man i called it just from

383.36 --> 387.68
looking at it and then trying to

384.96 --> 387.68
describe it

388.08 --> 392.639
and he basically got to the same

390.88 --> 395.52
conclusion

392.639 --> 397.199
from from a more exoteric researcher

395.52 --> 400.08
from actually looking through the works

397.199 --> 404.16
and that's always like

400.08 --> 409.84
makes it feel to me like damn

404.16 --> 409.84000000000003
yeah my skill is worth it

414.88 --> 418.71999999999997
egyptians yeah we're talking about good

416.96 --> 420.31899999999996
servants vid i was talking about the

418.72 --> 421.199
video i linked to the good servants

420.319 --> 425.52000000000004
video

421.199 --> 428.24
that he linked me to short video

425.52 --> 428.79999999999995
about basically the bible code what is

428.24 --> 432.72
in there

428.8 --> 434.08
this amazing thing it's like an amazing

432.72 --> 437.12
thing that's basic that's

434.08 --> 439.919
kind of covert its occult and you can

437.12 --> 439.919
connect to it

440.56 --> 447.919
and yet the priesthood is almost kind of

444.08 --> 448.71999999999997
trying to prevent people from doing that

447.919 --> 451.44
almost like there

448.72 --> 454.16
this obstacle to overcome you could see

451.44 --> 457.039
it like that you know

454.16 --> 458.72
anyway it was interesting uh yeah the

457.039 --> 460.8
egyptian thing

458.72 --> 462.47900000000004
i don't remember a lot in content what

460.8 --> 464.16
it was about but he was basically

462.479 --> 466.71999999999997
arguing about

464.16 --> 468.0
he was highlighting different examples

466.72 --> 470.8
of sites

468.0 --> 471.44
and then trying to cross-reference it

470.8 --> 474.639
with

471.44 --> 479.84
time based analysis it was just

474.639 --> 479.84000000000003
like archaeological presentation

480.8 --> 487.36
from a from a yeah from a re

483.919 --> 490.79999999999995
personal researchers perspective

487.36 --> 491.12
with the field knowledge but that isn't

490.8 --> 495.12
like

491.12 --> 498.56
part of of like bigger museum

495.12 --> 501.44
type of stories or something that's been

498.56 --> 503.28000000000003
accepted into mainstream so it's just

501.44 --> 508.56
very fascinating

503.28 --> 508.55999999999995
that video from brian forster

508.72 --> 512.88
and he's he's had that sort of video

510.96 --> 514.959
before

512.88 --> 516.399
although often i just don't catch it

514.959 --> 518.0799999999999
live because i don't

516.399 --> 520.56
i don't think he has a schedule or

518.08 --> 522.64
anything just happen to bump into when

520.56 --> 527.1199999999999
he goes live

522.64 --> 527.12
let me see i'll try to link

527.6 --> 533.6800000000001
oh yeah it's not brian's logic

539.12 --> 544.72
come on damn i have many subscriber

541.92 --> 544.7199999999999
subscriptions

546.839 --> 549.839
arc

550.64 --> 554.399
where is he yeah that's not top of the

554.0 --> 558.0
list

554.399 --> 559.6
it's ridiculous uh a thorough

558.0 --> 563.839
exploration of ancient

559.6 --> 563.839
sites in egypt right

569.12 --> 572.399
so here's the link to that

572.72 --> 576.88
if there's a chat replay even visible

574.64 --> 579.36
then you probably bump into me at some

576.88 --> 579.36
point there

582.08 --> 586.73
hey hello adam meekin

583.66 --> 586.73
[Music]

587.6 --> 593.0400000000001
egyptians didn't have time tv to waste

591.12 --> 597.519
their time on oh yeah but

593.04 --> 597.519
look every age had their own media

598.16 --> 604.88
i suspect that in ancient times

601.68 --> 608.4799999999999
this media was stage theatrics like

604.88 --> 608.48
pretty advanced theater

608.64 --> 615.92
so yeah maybe puppet shows

613.44 --> 617.6800000000001
for children that must be ancient you

615.92 --> 618.959
know because that basically starts with

617.68 --> 621.76
a parent just

618.959 --> 623.279
trying to make the kid imagine their

621.76 --> 625.4399999999999
hand as a puppet

623.279 --> 627.04
and that's like one of the first things

625.44 --> 628.9590000000001
you can

627.04 --> 631.1999999999999
you don't need anything to come up with

628.959 --> 634.3199999999999
that so

631.2 --> 636.8000000000001
but yeah theatrics of course people were

634.32 --> 637.7600000000001
always distracted by stories that stuck

636.8 --> 640.0
to their mind

637.76 --> 641.8389999999999
because that's a very easy way to

640.0 --> 642.48
control people and if you don't give it

641.839 --> 645.12
to them

642.48 --> 646.32
they get restless start making up their

645.12 --> 650.8
own stuff that's

646.32 --> 652.24
not as constructive that's usually

650.8 --> 654.24
why there's always some kind of

652.24 --> 656.64
theatrics around including in ancient

654.24 --> 658.88
egypt of course and the priest would be

656.64 --> 661.36
a lot in control of that

658.88 --> 663.8389999999999
theatrics because that theatrics is

661.36 --> 667.279
basically the mysticism

663.839 --> 668.24
that reinforces the power of the

667.279 --> 670.959
priesthood

668.24 --> 670.9590000000001
and the pharaoh

671.44 --> 675.12
story is so amazing and mind-blowing

673.519 --> 677.839
that people just can't

675.12 --> 679.519
get it on their own they can't

677.839 --> 682.0790000000001
understand the codes even though

679.519 --> 684.16
it's all in there then it's just like

682.079 --> 688.64
okay master you're smarter than me i'll

684.16 --> 691.1999999999999
do what you say

688.64 --> 692.079
sounds familiar doesn't it yeah you

691.2 --> 695.6800000000001
don't need

692.079 --> 703.8389999999999
tv screens for that tv screens just

695.68 --> 703.8389999999999
makes that process a lot easier

707.2 --> 710.2890000000001
[Music]

710.399 --> 713.68
why is up good videos in ancient

712.72 --> 716.8000000000001
architecture

713.68 --> 719.1999999999999
okay interesting i like this

716.8 --> 720.639
channel specifically from brian foster

719.2 --> 723.6
because he is

720.639 --> 725.44
at least like trying to be a serious

723.6 --> 729.9200000000001
archaeologist

725.44 --> 731.6
so he's sticking to a certain discipline

729.92 --> 734.16
and that doesn't

731.6 --> 735.12
that in itself doesn't naturally drag

734.16 --> 738.399
you away

735.12 --> 740.72
into fantastical ideas and

738.399 --> 744.079
then reifying them which is what a lot

740.72 --> 747.44
of people tend to do out there

744.079 --> 749.519
you know like i

747.44 --> 751.9200000000001
am at risk of doing that even with my

749.519 --> 754.0
conceptions

751.92 --> 755.68
because i am trying to get certain

754.0 --> 756.399
conceptions through to make people

755.68 --> 758.2399999999999
understand

756.399 --> 760.24
and keeping the possibility open that

758.24 --> 763.6800000000001
they might be real but i'm not

760.24 --> 766.88
saying it it must be real

763.68 --> 770.0
and when you basically say this is it

766.88 --> 771.68
then that's kind of what you're implying

770.0 --> 773.36
and if you then repeat that just like

771.68 --> 776.56
yeah this is it guys right

773.36 --> 779.6
this is it that's reifying

776.56 --> 780.959
then you're refining a concept that you

779.6 --> 785.12
don't know for sure

780.959 --> 785.1199999999999
even though it seems very viable

785.2 --> 787.839
right

788.639 --> 792.0
now yeah it's very tough for a lot of

790.56 --> 794.959
people to not do that

792.0 --> 795.92
when they think of a good idea to then

794.959 --> 798.8
not

795.92 --> 801.8389999999999
reify that immediately basically

798.8 --> 801.8389999999999
demanding it's real

806.0 --> 809.76
and yeah i appreciate people that are

808.16 --> 813.12
very disciplined it

809.76 --> 813.6
at not doing that at being very accurate

813.12 --> 819.279
between

813.6 --> 819.279
conceptual and physical reality

821.519 --> 829.35
because there's not that many of them

824.0 --> 840.8389999999999
it's very tough to do that

829.35 --> 843.839
[Music]

840.839 --> 843.839

1015.36 --> 1019.1990000000001
look if you don't know the details can

1017.12 --> 1020.8
you at least share where you got the

1019.199 --> 1025.839
idea from

1020.8 --> 1025.839
sort of source it

1033.039 --> 1041.039
framing the world okay yeah

1036.839 --> 1041.039
goody right

1041.679 --> 1050.64
yeah you know random videos out there

1045.6 --> 1050.6399999999999
like that that's all blabbers

1050.84 --> 1053.84
seriously

1054.24 --> 1058.799
like what did they even present to you

1057.12 --> 1061.76
as a

1058.799 --> 1064.0
traceable evidence to figure out that

1061.76 --> 1066.32
any of that was real

1064.0 --> 1081.84
ever heard of it have you ever seen any

1066.32 --> 1081.84
anything about it

1093.28 --> 1100.6399999999999
all right anyway never mind

1097.12 --> 1104.8799999999999
good servant says you have a moon idea

1100.64 --> 1104.88
so could you share that with us

1114.559 --> 1118.96
all right also i think there's something

1117.039 --> 1122.96
there's something weird going on in my

1118.96 --> 1126.4
social way of going about

1122.96 --> 1130.16
because now for a few days it seems like

1126.4 --> 1132.0800000000002
i don't know i get agitated

1130.16 --> 1134.16
and i'm now going to actively fight that

1132.08 --> 1137.76
because it seems very

1134.16 --> 1140.0
disrupt it's from my side

1137.76 --> 1141.28
i think that everybody is slowing down a

1140.0 --> 1143.52
bit

1141.28 --> 1145.84
and it kind of pisses me off because i

1143.52 --> 1149.28
just want to move on

1145.84 --> 1152.9599999999998
and not wait for minutes on end

1149.28 --> 1155.52
to get answers and [ __ ] even though yeah

1152.96 --> 1156.559
it's not there apparently people don't

1155.52 --> 1162.48
can't it's

1156.559 --> 1162.48
it's the autumn time energy drain it

1162.84 --> 1167.52
seems and it pisses me off and i'm not

1165.679 --> 1170.799
the only one by the way

1167.52 --> 1173.9189999999999
because i have it too but i'm trying to

1170.799 --> 1173.9189999999999
not give in to that

1174.0 --> 1181.44
just managing my energy very carefully

1179.44 --> 1183.4
but i think that that is kind of

1181.44 --> 1189.52
partially to blame for like the

1183.4 --> 1189.52
agitations in the last few shows

1190.32 --> 1193.76
and me yeah in retrospect kind of making

1192.559 --> 1197.52
myself look like an

1193.76 --> 1198.0
[ __ ] a little towards guns of nephron

1197.52 --> 1200.799
r p

1198.0 --> 1200.799
and rasta hat

1205.2 --> 1209.52
i apologize to rasta had like on skype

1207.679 --> 1211.44
but i think he's probably really pissed

1209.52 --> 1214.0
off

1211.44 --> 1216.24
because yeah it sounds like he was in a

1214.0 --> 1218.48
really sucky situation

1216.24 --> 1221.039
and i couldn't like psychologically deal

1218.48 --> 1224.159
with it

1221.039 --> 1224.1589999999999
didn't know what to tell him

1225.679 --> 1227.919
huh

1230.88 --> 1235.8400000000001
hey rest that good morning

1240.88 --> 1245.679
it's like i'm i'm literally following

1243.679 --> 1248.159
big bear policy at it and trying to

1245.679 --> 1250.48
avoid despair

1248.159 --> 1251.44
but sometimes yeah i'm not gonna like

1250.48 --> 1253.679
ban people

1251.44 --> 1254.64
like because they do not gonna be like

1253.679 --> 1257.8400000000001
that

1254.64 --> 1260.96
you know you guys are a little closer

1257.84 --> 1265.12
to me can't do that that's

1260.96 --> 1265.1200000000001
it's gonna hurt people but

1265.36 --> 1268.3999999999999
yeah unless like you're typically a

1267.28 --> 1272.559
squirter

1268.4 --> 1273.52
but anyway but yeah rasta definitely

1272.559 --> 1277.84
isn't

1273.52 --> 1277.84
and neither is guns i've never run rmp

1285.919 --> 1291.8400000000001
things are better tonight oh that's good

1287.84 --> 1291.84
that's good to hear

1293.679 --> 1300.0800000000002
right yeah i i had less fiber

1298.08 --> 1302.3999999999999
i can only call them like sub

1300.08 --> 1304.24
vibrational distortions

1302.4 --> 1306.3200000000002
because it does seem like sound but it's

1304.24 --> 1307.2
not coming from anywhere so it's not

1306.32 --> 1310.08
like

1307.2 --> 1312.0800000000002
an amplitudinal wave coming from

1310.08 --> 1313.76
somewhere like a light coming from a

1312.08 --> 1316.8799999999999
light source towards you

1313.76 --> 1319.28
not like that it's more like a just the

1316.88 --> 1320.64
preponderance of all the sounds that are

1319.28 --> 1323.2
happening

1320.64 --> 1325.2800000000002
that aren't necessarily hurt they cause

1323.2 --> 1327.6000000000001
like resonances in rooms

1325.28 --> 1328.72
in specific type of almost like a

1327.6 --> 1331.9189999999999
crystalline

1328.72 --> 1334.32
pattern and that just happens when

1331.919 --> 1337.76
certain things start to make sound

1334.32 --> 1339.6789999999999
could be machines like in the basement

1337.76 --> 1340.64
somewhere in another building even and

1339.679 --> 1343.039
that could just

1340.64 --> 1344.96
cause a certain type of vibration that

1343.039 --> 1347.36
will cascade

1344.96 --> 1349.28
and i happen to be sitting in one so it

1347.36 --> 1352.559
seems sometimes

1349.28 --> 1356.799
because if i move from that spot

1352.559 --> 1360.0
i like go sit in my chair

1356.799 --> 1364.08
instead of lying in my bed then it's not

1360.0 --> 1366.72
there it's weird how that works

1364.08 --> 1368.58
it's just the natural side effect of

1366.72 --> 1369.76
society

1368.58 --> 1372.32
[Music]

1369.76 --> 1374.08
and i don't have electric distortions as

1372.32 --> 1377.12
much it took care of that

1374.08 --> 1378.8799999999999
i don't have any cables in very near

1377.12 --> 1381.12
proximity to me

1378.88 --> 1383.2800000000002
that have active electricity running

1381.12 --> 1387.6789999999999
through them

1383.28 --> 1390.8799999999999
uh but yeah yesterday i did get like a

1387.679 --> 1393.2
helicopter that was hovering over

1390.88 --> 1394.88
well hovering was going circles over me

1393.2 --> 1398.72
like in the middle of the night for like

1394.88 --> 1398.72
half an hour that was super annoying

1399.2 --> 1404.96
what the [ __ ] what are you doing there

1401.919 --> 1404.96
like for so long

1406.08 --> 1408.48
anyway

1414.84 --> 1417.84
okay

1421.039 --> 1423.279
what

1425.039 --> 1429.6
because the moon is colder than the

1427.36 --> 1433.4399999999998
earth what

1429.6 --> 1433.4399999999998
really so how does

1434.64 --> 1441.8400000000001
material temperature

1438.24 --> 1445.44
on the physical surface ride

1441.84 --> 1448.559
onto light

1445.44 --> 1452.159
martin telberg seems

1448.559 --> 1459.84
kind of yeah you can't really

1452.159 --> 1459.8400000000001
explain how that works like what is cold

1461.679 --> 1465.1200000000001
how can light transfer

1465.52 --> 1473.84
cold from a physical surface

1474.159 --> 1481.6000000000001
see it's physical heat

1477.76 --> 1484.96
and cold are physical transitions within

1481.6 --> 1486.0
matter how can that transfer over light

1484.96 --> 1488.64
how the yeah

1486.0 --> 1489.44
i don't even understand how that could

1488.64 --> 1493.2
ever be done

1489.44 --> 1496.3200000000002
in a natural process like seriously

1493.2 --> 1499.6000000000001
can you transfer cold

1496.32 --> 1504.24
through light by for example

1499.6 --> 1507.6
shining light on a surface

1504.24 --> 1512.159
that is very cold like

1507.6 --> 1514.6399999999999
i don't know some kind of aquarium setup

1512.159 --> 1515.8400000000001
and something really cold in there like

1514.64 --> 1518.72
a just

1515.84 --> 1520.08
extra super cool eyes and then you shine

1518.72 --> 1522.08
a light on it

1520.08 --> 1523.12
through the through the box it would

1522.08 --> 1526.1589999999999
have to be

1523.12 --> 1528.1589999999999
yes shut off and then shine the light

1526.159 --> 1530.64
and it reflects on something else that

1528.159 --> 1533.919
is not in that cold region and then

1530.64 --> 1536.24
that light will cool

1533.919 --> 1538.24
the spot it's hitting that was reflected

1536.24 --> 1538.72
from within the cold setup does that

1538.24 --> 1542.72
happen

1538.72 --> 1544.88
really well that will be a first

1542.72 --> 1556.1100000000001
never heard of that could you

1544.88 --> 1560.48
demonstrate that

1556.11 --> 1563.76
[Music]

1560.48 --> 1566.72
a video can't explain it

1563.76 --> 1568.72
no no no no no no yeah i understand your

1566.72 --> 1573.039
concept i'm just saying

1568.72 --> 1576.88
this is this setup conceptual setup

1573.039 --> 1579.84
it should be testable here on earth

1576.88 --> 1581.44
so can light be reflected off something

1579.84 --> 1585.279
super cold

1581.44 --> 1588.96
then where it is reflected to can that

1585.279 --> 1593.2
actually trans yeah transport

1588.96 --> 1596.64
the cold from the cold object

1593.2 --> 1600.0800000000002
to the place that the light is hitting

1596.64 --> 1602.159
this is testable so yeah a

1600.08 --> 1604.559
video telling you is not going to do

1602.159 --> 1604.5590000000002
anything

1607.039 --> 1612.799
i want to see the proof that this can be

1610.84 --> 1614.48
done

1612.799 --> 1615.84
i don't think so i think that my

1614.48 --> 1618.48
conception

1615.84 --> 1619.9189999999999
of the moonlight having a very specific

1618.48 --> 1623.6
frequency that just

1619.919 --> 1626.4
allows heat to transform more

1623.6 --> 1628.1589999999999
to transfer mediums more rapidly i think

1626.4 --> 1631.3600000000001
that is more likely

1628.159 --> 1635.6000000000001
it's just a entropy

1631.36 --> 1635.6
it would be an entropy increasing

1635.84 --> 1640.72
yeah the light would subject the object

1639.2 --> 1646.0
to entropy

1640.72 --> 1646.0
increasing frequency something like that

1647.679 --> 1651.76
i think that is much more likely and it

1650.159 --> 1655.0390000000002
has nothing to do with light being

1651.76 --> 1656.8799999999999
reflected of an object

1655.039 --> 1659.919
it's just the very nature of the

1656.88 --> 1659.919
frequency of that light

1661.279 --> 1664.88
that would be the conception to support

1664.559 --> 1667.76
my

1664.88 --> 1668.72
idea here that can be tested by the way

1667.76 --> 1683.84
as i

1668.72 --> 1683.84
explained many times

1694.84 --> 1697.84
hmm

1708.88 --> 1713.7600000000002
all right okay rest ahead you say the

1712.0 --> 1715.679
moon doesn't do anything so you say that

1713.76 --> 1718.32
moonlight frequency doesn't have any

1715.679 --> 1722.5590000000002
influences

1718.32 --> 1724.8799999999999
on plants i was pretty sure that it did

1722.559 --> 1727.039
it's not just the phases it's also just

1724.88 --> 1727.0390000000002
the

1727.2 --> 1732.48
the subjection to moonlight

1730.32 --> 1735.2
also there's these other elements that

1732.48 --> 1735.2
do happen

1736.159 --> 1740.159
like if you leave meat in the in the

1739.2 --> 1743.8400000000001
moonlight it

1740.159 --> 1746.0800000000002
will actually rot more quickly

1743.84 --> 1747.84
that sort of thing which would support

1746.08 --> 1749.52
again my conception that it's actually

1747.84 --> 1751.12
an entropy enhancer

1749.52 --> 1753.36
that that is the effect it's not

1751.12 --> 1755.6
introducing coal it enhances entropy

1753.36 --> 1761.4399999999998
that will make sense

1755.6 --> 1761.4399999999998
with the sped up rotting process

1764.84 --> 1767.84
anyway

1770.08 --> 1774.8799999999999
also i've i think that moonlight also

1773.44 --> 1779.919
does have influences

1774.88 --> 1779.919
on fungi a lot in some way so

1784.559 --> 1795.84
but maybe not on the other the plants

1787.36 --> 1795.84
that you grow i don't know

1802.11 --> 1805.2099999999998
[Music]

1806.84 --> 1809.84
hmm

1817.36 --> 1820.32
when uncovered

1820.559 --> 1824.72
right but stop the trafficking arrest

1822.72 --> 1827.919
that that's the point

1824.72 --> 1831.52
it has been thoroughly tested it's like

1827.919 --> 1834.88
ancient pagan knowledge in a way

1831.52 --> 1837.679
if you leave uh meat

1834.88 --> 1839.1200000000001
out in the sun it you can actually

1837.679 --> 1841.919
conserve it that way

1839.12 --> 1842.8799999999999
you can sun dried meat if you leave it

1841.919 --> 1846.48
in the moon it's

1842.88 --> 1849.7600000000002
gonna rot but if you just leave it

1846.48 --> 1851.84
in an open barn without sun or moonlight

1849.76 --> 1855.12
it will not rot as fast as when you

1851.84 --> 1855.12
leave it under the moonlight

1855.52 --> 1861.039
no it's not [ __ ] it does do

1858.64 --> 1861.039
something

1862.32 --> 1865.84
there is something about the moonlight

1867.519 --> 1871.36
no it's not the air that's dry the meat

1872.159 --> 1874.48
nope

1877.2 --> 1881.44
you can also air dry meat but that's

1879.919 --> 1883.519
different

1881.44 --> 1886.88
and you put it in like a special air

1883.519 --> 1886.88
drying oven or something

1888.159 --> 1892.24
no you don't it doesn't even have to be

1890.96 --> 1895.6000000000001
in the heat

1892.24 --> 1897.76
like they i think they they do this

1895.6 --> 1899.36
in or they have done this in colder

1897.76 --> 1901.36
regions too

1899.36 --> 1902.7199999999998
if there's sun out then you just put it

1901.36 --> 1906.0
on a rock it doesn't

1902.72 --> 1909.279
cook it's not super hot but it does get

1906.0 --> 1912.159
lit by the sun and that kind of prevents

1909.279 --> 1912.159
it from rotting

1918.84 --> 1921.84
really

1923.6 --> 1928.799
all right butchery really

1930.08 --> 1934.24
all right well i bet they don't do it

1931.76 --> 1936.48
anymore why would you

1934.24 --> 1938.72
leave it out like that it's it's

1936.48 --> 1942.72
basically

1938.72 --> 1942.72
wilderness techniques that that comes

1946.84 --> 1949.84
from

1964.559 --> 1967.12
okay

1971.039 --> 1975.36
all right well okay look if you insist

1973.279 --> 1978.159
that this is not real

1975.36 --> 1991.84
this can all be tested you know this can

1978.159 --> 1991.8400000000001
be tested

2010.48 --> 2019.84
the rock does something indeed okay sure

2012.88 --> 2019.8400000000001
it does

2032.48 --> 2050.0
all right curing meat

2047.84 --> 2052.0789999999997
yeah i think big bear is into that as

2050.0 --> 2061.839
well right now he was talking about

2052.079 --> 2061.8390000000004
raw meat eating raw meat

2071.599 --> 2075.839
hmm anyway

2081.199 --> 2086.379
[Music]

2100.4 --> 2105.38
yes hello agm

2102.31 --> 2105.38
[Music]

2141.2 --> 2145.68
right yeah russ dad yeah he was talking

2143.599 --> 2148.48
big bear was talking about maddie mostly

2145.68 --> 2148.48
likes the fat

2148.88 --> 2152.7200000000003
that he likes to eat the fat raw not so

2152.16 --> 2156.839
much

2152.72 --> 2159.2799999999997
the the actual flesh the muscle and all

2156.839 --> 2161.92
that

2159.28 --> 2162.8
i don't know it yeah that was two days

2161.92 --> 2173.76
ago by the way

2162.8 --> 2176.96
i was talking about that i think

2173.76 --> 2179.2000000000003
yeah but yeah i'm not so much for raw

2176.96 --> 2179.2
meat

2184.839 --> 2187.839
well

2212.839 --> 2215.839
uh

2226.839 --> 2229.839
right

2240.839 --> 2243.839
huh

2245.44 --> 2250.8
yeah martin talborg maybe or maybe they

2247.839 --> 2250.7999999999997
have just a very

2251.359 --> 2255.359
yeah a very efficient digestion system

2254.24 --> 2271.839
so they just

2255.359 --> 2271.839
can take it much easier

2285.52 --> 2290.96
cucumbers what it does

2291.839 --> 2302.7999999999997
i didn't know that

2299.52 --> 2306.8
i rarely eat it i i just like it

2302.8 --> 2306.8
sometimes because it's kind of juicy

2309.2 --> 2313.839
it is good for the skin though

2338.839 --> 2341.839
so

2342.4 --> 2345.2000000000003
right anyway

2351.44 --> 2355.359
all right i almost forgot that was also

2355.52 --> 2359.119
there was ball busters yesterday of

2357.2 --> 2360.72
course

2359.119 --> 2362.96
i don't know why i didn't write that

2360.72 --> 2362.9599999999996
down

2366.88 --> 2373.52
choreo this again it was pretty

2369.92 --> 2373.52
it was pretty good and funny

2378.24 --> 2383.839
and it was part of it

2389.28 --> 2392.2400000000002
anybody see that

2393.76 --> 2398.0
i probably i don't know i guess that

2396.48 --> 2399.76
most people at this point every time

2398.0 --> 2400.72
they see coriola somewhere they're like

2399.76 --> 2403.92
oh god no

2400.72 --> 2403.9199999999996
not more curious

2405.52 --> 2409.52
but it was still a pretty good hangout

2407.28 --> 2413.76
though

2409.52 --> 2416.72
it was really about all the technicals

2413.76 --> 2416.7200000000003
laying it all out

2418.64 --> 2422.16
so if you have any kind of

2420.319 --> 2423.2
misunderstanding about the coriolis

2422.16 --> 2425.839
effect i think

2423.2 --> 2428.0789999999997
that that ball busters is a good show to

2425.839 --> 2430.24
watch if you want to

2428.079 --> 2432.1600000000003
brush up on your understanding of what

2430.24 --> 2439.839
the coriolis effect is

2432.16 --> 2439.839
and the misunderstandings

2455.28 --> 2461.599
salt is good for yeah well that depends

2458.4 --> 2463.839
if you're talking about refined salt

2461.599 --> 2467.839
old-fashioned table salt that's not good

2463.839 --> 2467.839
for you at all

2467.92 --> 2473.839
although you do need some of that

2471.04 --> 2473.839
just a little

2474.96 --> 2482.0
in yeah if you just to stay hydrated

2478.72 --> 2485.5989999999997
in hot situations you need a little salt

2482.0 --> 2486.96
but yeah i don't take refined salt at

2485.599 --> 2489.119
all

2486.96 --> 2490.16
i haven't for a long time for like 20

2489.119 --> 2493.359
years

2490.16 --> 2497.1189999999997
i just go with unrefined salt or like

2493.359 --> 2500.72
himalayan salts those types of salts

2497.119 --> 2500.7200000000003
because all the minerals are still in

2506.839 --> 2512.1
there

2508.68 --> 2512.1
[Music]

2515.92 --> 2519.52
and it tastes much better anyway you

2518.8 --> 2523.3590000000004
know that

2519.52 --> 2526.4
pure concentrated salt sensation

2523.359 --> 2528.96
it's just ill really it is

2526.4 --> 2529.76
but if i take like a crystal of

2528.96 --> 2533.2
himalayan

2529.76 --> 2535.8390000000004
sea salt there's so much more to that

2533.2 --> 2538.64
it's more of a taste it's better

2535.839 --> 2541.2799999999997
it feels good not if you're gonna take

2538.64 --> 2543.7599999999998
like an entire spoon of it maybe

2541.28 --> 2544.3190000000004
but compared to table salt that's just

2543.76 --> 2548.8390000000004
like

2544.319 --> 2551.839
yeah it's burnt it's like burny salt

2548.839 --> 2551.839
yuck

2564.079 --> 2568.96
like the only reason anyone ever would

2566.8 --> 2572.7200000000003
still take some kind of table saw this

2568.96 --> 2575.599
to take the iodine the iodized

2572.72 --> 2578.24
table salt but yeah there's other ways

2575.599 --> 2581.28
to get that as well

2578.24 --> 2584.4799999999996
and there's even traces of it

2581.28 --> 2586.5600000000004
in himalayan sea salt there's a lot of

2584.48 --> 2589.599
different things in there

2586.56 --> 2593.839
in very minute amounts but

2589.599 --> 2593.839
it's still in there

2600.88 --> 2609.599
also has all the toxins in it oh really

2604.24 --> 2609.5989999999997
the toxins which toxins are you talking

2618.839 --> 2621.839
about

2627.92 --> 2633.119
uh well george sanford i've been using

2631.359 --> 2636.16
himalayan salt

2633.119 --> 2639.359
exclusively and generously

2636.16 --> 2641.04
because i love salt i love using salt

2639.359 --> 2642.48
and coke i've kind of toned down a

2641.04 --> 2644.64
little but

2642.48 --> 2648.0
i had a terrible habit of basically

2644.64 --> 2651.1189999999997
cooking like a freaking

2648.0 --> 2656.0
yeah mediterranean

2651.119 --> 2659.28
crazy guy i would like scoop

2656.0 --> 2661.76
lots of salt lots of pepper

2659.28 --> 2662.6400000000003
lots of whatever herb i was using

2661.76 --> 2665.76
rosemary

2662.64 --> 2666.64
if like on like seriously my rosemary

2665.76 --> 2669.76
potatoes

2666.64 --> 2671.7599999999998
baked they were like you couldn't even

2669.76 --> 2674.3190000000004
see the potato from all the herbs that

2671.76 --> 2674.3190000000004
were on it

2674.839 --> 2680.88
right because i like it

2678.24 --> 2682.0
but i don't yeah i don't do use as much

2680.88 --> 2684.319
anymore

2682.0 --> 2685.119
don't want to waste it makes me feel bad

2684.319 --> 2687.52
to just wait

2685.119 --> 2690.6400000000003
waste good product because i can't

2687.52 --> 2692.16
literally eat all that

2690.64 --> 2694.24
but it was very yeah it was a bit

2692.16 --> 2698.7999999999997
wasteful with that now i'm

2694.24 --> 2702.64
more precise in my doses dosaging

2698.8 --> 2705.6800000000003
but i still do like just plenty of

2702.64 --> 2709.52
of good salt and pepper and

2705.68 --> 2712.24
herbs all kinds of herbs rosemary

2709.52 --> 2712.24
oregano

2713.28 --> 2722.7200000000003
those are the most typical ones uh

2718.56 --> 2724.96
yeah or if i'm gonna go more of the uh

2722.72 --> 2727.1189999999997
eastern type of kitchen then i'll get to

2724.96 --> 2727.119
the

2727.52 --> 2735.119
ginger powders for example

2731.04 --> 2735.119
if i use that i'm gonna be very generous

2735.92 --> 2742.2400000000002
uh i don't have that many different

2739.44 --> 2742.2400000000002
types of herbs

2744.8 --> 2748.88
i just really use the ones that i really

2758.839 --> 2761.839
like

2766.72 --> 2771.04
ah talking about all these foods make me

2768.64 --> 2771.04
hungry

2772.319 --> 2789.839
next time to go another 45 minutes or so

2823.52 --> 2826.64
yeah i don't get it either martin

2824.96 --> 2829.04
tolberg

2826.64 --> 2831.1189999999997
maybe suggesting like they just give it

2829.04 --> 2833.68
completely unrefined

2831.119 --> 2835.6800000000003
like they find a scoop of salt crystal

2833.68 --> 2837.68
and they put it in a bag and then that

2835.68 --> 2839.2799999999997
goes into the grocery shop

2837.68 --> 2841.2
pretty sure that's not what happens i'm

2839.28 --> 2844.4
pretty sure they do

2841.2 --> 2847.2
completely dissolve it

2844.4 --> 2849.119
make sure that like any stuff they

2847.2 --> 2850.72
really don't want in there it can still

2849.119 --> 2854.96
be in between somewhere

2850.72 --> 2854.9599999999996
sometime get that out

2855.52 --> 2859.839
but leave as much the natural

2858.24 --> 2861.4399999999996
compositions of what is in there in

2859.839 --> 2863.52
there

2861.44 --> 2865.44
but if it's gonna be like seriously

2863.52 --> 2870.16
poison

2865.44 --> 2870.16
then yeah that's that's gonna be

2870.839 --> 2873.839
registered

2883.28 --> 2888.1600000000003
end up in sea salt what george sanford

2887.2 --> 2890.8799999999997
you're

2888.16 --> 2891.44
are you suggesting like sea salt in

2890.88 --> 2894.4
general

2891.44 --> 2894.4
is literally

2895.2 --> 2898.5589999999997
like taken from these salination plants

2897.599 --> 2902.1600000000003
or something

2898.559 --> 2902.1600000000003
do you think that that is where

2902.24 --> 2910.5589999999997
sea salt comes from i don't think so

2906.88 --> 2913.76
i think that they're probably

2910.559 --> 2914.559
getting table salt from that process or

2913.76 --> 2918.0
anything

2914.559 --> 2918.7200000000003
but sea salt and likes and himalayan

2918.0 --> 2922.079
salt is

2918.72 --> 2925.5989999999997
much more obvious is from dry land

2922.079 --> 2928.88
dried up seas as they call it

2925.599 --> 2932.4
it's not from modern from modern waters

2928.88 --> 2942.7200000000003
from modern sea it's very old

2932.4 --> 2945.6800000000003
it's not polluted like that

2942.72 --> 2947.9199999999996
you seem to be very ill informed about

2945.68 --> 2949.5989999999997
salt

2947.92 --> 2957.839
how that's actually produced where it's

2949.599 --> 2957.839
coming from

2961.2 --> 2968.0789999999997
you think that it like

2965.119 --> 2970.2400000000002
salt for all salt salt crystal was so

2968.079 --> 2971.2000000000003
incredibly unhealthy that they would use

2970.24 --> 2974.9599999999996
it

2971.2 --> 2976.96
as payment in the roman army

2974.96 --> 2979.52
presuming that all of that actually

2976.96 --> 2979.52
existed

2979.92 --> 2984.4
a bit of a tough one but yeah i don't

2983.359 --> 2986.88
know where you're getting this from

2984.4 --> 2989.52
that's like a really unhealthy

2986.88 --> 2991.599
it's a resource it's always been a

2989.52 --> 2994.16
resource

2991.599 --> 2996.0
and it's for trade even in ancient times

2994.16 --> 2998.0
why do you think that is

2996.0 --> 3000.72
it's not because it's poisonous and you

2998.0 --> 3000.72
die from it

3001.76 --> 3005.5200000000004
it's because it's actually good for you

3007.2 --> 3010.96
and there's a lot of trace minerals in

3009.04 --> 3013.2799999999997
there naturally

3010.96 --> 3014.8
that you don't really get from another

3013.28 --> 3016.8
from regular

3014.8 --> 3018.559
farming and all that typically

3016.8 --> 3022.96
especially the old style

3018.559 --> 3027.8390000000004
farming the not so good one

3022.96 --> 3027.839
where the land gets depleted

3041.599 --> 3044.88
yeah agm i certainly hope you're right

3043.92 --> 3048.559
about that i

3044.88 --> 3049.119
really do now the sea is incredibly fast

3048.559 --> 3052.2400000000002
and

3049.119 --> 3052.88
just insanely fast and there's so much

3052.24 --> 3056.72
there's still

3052.88 --> 3060.319
new life being discovered there so

3056.72 --> 3061.2799999999997
it would be sensible that humans are

3060.319 --> 3064.079
bound

3061.28 --> 3064.88
just by by habit like they have to do it

3064.079 --> 3067.52
somehow

3064.88 --> 3068.0
what they do that they're gonna dump

3067.52 --> 3069.7599999999998
[ __ ]

3068.0 --> 3071.359
in rivers and that'll end up in the

3069.76 --> 3075.119
ocean that's

3071.359 --> 3075.119
there was no way to avoid that

3075.44 --> 3082.4
right and if they don't have any

3079.44 --> 3083.599
industry like activities like that at

3082.4 --> 3085.92
least they're gonna be

3083.599 --> 3087.2000000000003
having getting sewers or just [ __ ]

3085.92 --> 3091.2000000000003
in the river all

3087.2 --> 3094.319
you know like india and certain places

3091.2 --> 3096.319
so yeah that was always going to happen

3094.319 --> 3100.72
then it seems only sensible

3096.319 --> 3104.24
that a designer would account for that

3100.72 --> 3106.3999999999996
somehow but yeah i don't know

3104.24 --> 3108.64
you know there's also a lot of new type

3106.4 --> 3111.92
of pollution

3108.64 --> 3112.319
that humans have concocted that yeah

3111.92 --> 3115.04
that

3112.319 --> 3117.119
have come out of the the modern

3115.04 --> 3119.44
modernization of industry and

3117.119 --> 3120.319
chemical industry there have been

3119.44 --> 3122.64
poisons

3120.319 --> 3124.0
coming out that i don't know if nature

3122.64 --> 3127.7599999999998
can truly deal with that

3124.0 --> 3131.92
you know things like micro plastics

3127.76 --> 3135.44
there are issues that that

3131.92 --> 3141.92
don't seem like they're getting solved

3135.44 --> 3144.88
so now that may be a matter of time

3141.92 --> 3145.839
like that it might actually get solved

3144.88 --> 3148.4
naturally

3145.839 --> 3149.7599999999998
although i don't see how that could work

3148.4 --> 3154.96
how nature could

3149.76 --> 3157.76
like adapt the cleaning cycle like that

3154.96 --> 3159.599
but who knows or maybe humans will

3157.76 --> 3166.0
figure out how to completely

3159.599 --> 3168.319
undo that i don't know

3166.0 --> 3170.24
it's only sensible that the ocean would

3168.319 --> 3173.2799999999997
have

3170.24 --> 3177.839
lots of things in it that would

3173.28 --> 3180.96
break down pollution of any sort

3177.839 --> 3184.319
and hopefully yeah

3180.96 --> 3185.599
turn it into something more useful or at

3184.319 --> 3188.16
least less

3185.599 --> 3188.1600000000003
pollutant

3190.0 --> 3195.839
one can only hope

3214.24 --> 3221.359
but yeah the more we do use the oceans

3217.76 --> 3222.8
acutely just from the sheer amount of

3221.359 --> 3225.359
waste

3222.8 --> 3225.8390000000004
the more we do pollute it all at once

3225.359 --> 3228.88
the more

3225.839 --> 3231.2799999999997
that will burden

3228.88 --> 3233.839
the thriving capabilities of the natural

3231.28 --> 3233.8390000000004
life in it

3235.119 --> 3238.96
then yeah that's not going to be good

3237.119 --> 3242.88
for that and that's going to

3238.96 --> 3242.88
basically punish us through the

3242.96 --> 3247.28
the decreasing amount of food

3244.64 --> 3250.319
availability from the ocean

3247.28 --> 3251.3590000000004
but that doesn't mean that they are the

3250.319 --> 3254.8
same source as

3251.359 --> 3256.96
what would potentially be getting rid of

3254.8 --> 3258.48
the pollution in it

3256.96 --> 3260.16
it's very likely that the things that

3258.48 --> 3265.839
are getting rid of the pollution

3260.16 --> 3265.839
are edible or anything like that to us

3267.04 --> 3274.319
so yeah it's it's a complicated dynamic

3272.0 --> 3279.839
[Music]

3274.319 --> 3279.839
it has to be

3282.22 --> 3285.2999999999997
[Music]

3302.559 --> 3306.3190000000004
oh god no i'm not gonna google that

3305.119 --> 3308.07
martin thalberg

3306.319 --> 3315.739
come on

3308.07 --> 3315.739
[Music]

3318.839 --> 3321.839
terrible

3333.76 --> 3339.6800000000003
yeah well they they'll think of the most

3335.92 --> 3339.6800000000003
ridiculous dumb [ __ ] ever

3340.079 --> 3346.2400000000002
and i'm sure there's a study after it

3342.16 --> 3350.319
there's studies that are so ridiculous

3346.24 --> 3363.839
no surprise but yeah if you don't mind

3350.319 --> 3363.839
i'm not gonna entertain it

3379.68 --> 3387.9199999999996
[Music]

3384.64 --> 3390.8799999999997
all right anyway

3387.92 --> 3391.599
yeah open for subjects other than that

3390.88 --> 3405.839
thanks

3391.599 --> 3405.839
martin tolbert

3406.16 --> 3412.96
any comments on my recent work

3409.839 --> 3419.839
any questions any inquiries anything

3412.96 --> 3419.839
guys this is just hanging around here

3428.24 --> 3433.5989999999997
yeah and the movies that i watched would

3430.839 --> 3447.839
just

3433.599 --> 3447.839
they were kind of stupid

3451.76 --> 3461.8390000000004
anybody out there

3485.44 --> 3489.44
all right otherwise i'm gonna get some

3487.119 --> 3492.7200000000003
lunch because i'm kind of hungry

3489.44 --> 3494.7200000000003
and then yeah i don't really know

3492.72 --> 3498.48
i don't have any specific inspiration to

3494.72 --> 3498.48
talk about anything anyway so

3499.96 --> 3505.92
overpopulation really

3502.88 --> 3505.92
want to talk about that

3506.4 --> 3510.88
here are the topics yeah that's okay you

3508.64 --> 3517.839
tried martin tolberg

3510.88 --> 3517.839
it's just

3520.64 --> 3531.839
population hoax i don't even know how

3523.52 --> 3531.839
many people really exist

3539.359 --> 3545.839
maybe one billion maybe i don't know

3562.0 --> 3573.839
the pacific and atlantic do not mix

3565.68 --> 3573.839
what what do you mean

3583.839 --> 3587.839
pretty sure they're interconnected

3595.04 --> 3601.839
what do you mean george sanford

3619.839 --> 3624.48
a deep layer of very salty impenetrable

3623.2 --> 3628.72
water

3624.48 --> 3630.96
well so they say

3628.72 --> 3632.319
i've by the way i've seen that on camera

3630.96 --> 3634.4
so there is something

3632.319 --> 3636.96
and it's not completely impenetrable

3634.4 --> 3643.839
though there's actually creatures that

3636.96 --> 3643.839
can get in and out

3645.44 --> 3649.599
it was kind of yeah they showed this in

3648.16 --> 3651.92
a

3649.599 --> 3655.2000000000003
nature show and they showed like how

3651.92 --> 3658.7200000000003
these sort of worm creatures

3655.2 --> 3660.799
they typically hang around but if they

3658.72 --> 3662.5589999999997
get caught in it then they have like

3660.799 --> 3664.319
they start to panic because they get

3662.559 --> 3667.6800000000003
saline poisoning

3664.319 --> 3672.72
and if they then don't get out again

3667.68 --> 3677.7599999999998
they die and they just float down

3672.72 --> 3677.7599999999998
in the saline water they're weird

3680.72 --> 3686.319
so yeah who knows what is yeah beyond

3683.76 --> 3688.3190000000004
those saline waters

3686.319 --> 3690.96
and also it reminds me like is there

3688.319 --> 3693.599
some kind of osmosis effect between this

3690.96 --> 3694.64
super saline water layer and the rest is

3693.599 --> 3699.3590000000004
there

3694.64 --> 3705.1189999999997
is it doing something

3699.359 --> 3708.96
like would that say line water typically

3705.119 --> 3708.96
like extract certain

3709.04 --> 3715.52
saline solution solutions

3712.48 --> 3718.4
soluble saline syllable

3715.52 --> 3720.799
poisons with it kind of like by osmosis

3718.4 --> 3722.0
by being super salty basically scrub

3720.799 --> 3725.28
that off the regular

3722.0 --> 3726.079
oceanic waters maybe it is part of like

3725.28 --> 3730.48
a recycling

3726.079 --> 3730.48
system added i don't know man

3734.96 --> 3742.88
part of the earth battery okay

3741.119 --> 3744.96
well it would certainly be interesting

3742.88 --> 3749.119
to basically go down there

3744.96 --> 3751.52
and then like put a like a lightning rod

3749.119 --> 3753.2000000000003
in there and just measure like is there

3751.52 --> 3756.24
some tension when i put it

3753.2 --> 3761.0389999999998
in the super sailing water

3756.24 --> 3761.0389999999998
or isn't there wouldn't that be

3766.839 --> 3769.839
interesting

3793.52 --> 3797.839
yes i've seen that they do not mix

3811.76 --> 3815.5200000000004
probably because yeah it is logical

3813.76 --> 3818.4
though in a way

3815.52 --> 3819.44
because the water that is super saline

3818.4 --> 3822.64
it is basically

3819.44 --> 3825.28
saturated with salt and then yeah it

3822.64 --> 3828.48
kind of becomes different

3825.28 --> 3831.76
it's it's not the same thing anymore

3828.48 --> 3832.319
in a way especially when it's really

3831.76 --> 3834.6400000000003
cold

3832.319 --> 3835.52
i think i think that is part of the

3834.64 --> 3838.5589999999997
process that if

3835.52 --> 3841.2
as long as it's really cold then it

3838.559 --> 3843.92
it kind of just stays apart if you would

3841.2 --> 3846.8799999999997
heat it up it would then start to

3843.92 --> 3847.359
expand and mix and all that but yeah

3846.88 --> 3850.0
these

3847.359 --> 3851.5989999999997
oceanic bottoms it's not exactly warm

3850.0 --> 3867.839
down there

3851.599 --> 3867.839
at these super sailing water places

3870.4 --> 3873.76
right george stanford yeah it's kind of

3873.28 --> 3876.96
funny

3873.76 --> 3880.0
because think about it like this

3876.96 --> 3882.64
in was it is it in spongebob

3880.0 --> 3885.2
or i know i even remember it from the

3882.64 --> 3886.319
snorkels the old cartoon stupid kid

3885.2 --> 3888.72
cartoon

3886.319 --> 3890.319
that they had an ocean that they would

3888.72 --> 3892.0
be sunning at the ocean

3890.319 --> 3893.54
well that's i was always like how can

3892.0 --> 3896.16
there be an ocean under

3893.54 --> 3899.2799999999997
[Laughter]

3896.16 --> 3901.2
but it was funny but now

3899.28 --> 3903.52
yeah apparently there are these super

3901.2 --> 3906.72
saiyan oceans so

3903.52 --> 3909.52
maybe that is it maybe that was that

3906.72 --> 3911.6099999999997
i never knew that by the way back then

3909.52 --> 3914.639
that there even was such a thing

3911.61 --> 3914.639
[Music]

3915.2 --> 3920.24
only first ever saw the conception of

3918.079 --> 3921.599
super saiyan water in a dark world

3920.24 --> 3925.2799999999997
vision no less and that was

3921.599 --> 3929.039
like when i was 15 or 17

3925.28 --> 3937.8390000000004
somewhere over there not before the 90s

3929.039 --> 3937.8390000000004
for sure

3944.799 --> 3951.839
that's that you're putting in chat

3962.839 --> 3965.839
okay

3974.72 --> 3982.0789999999997
oh god oh

3978.079 --> 3984.559
yeah thanks for the baller

3982.079 --> 3992.25
explanation video that's just freaking

3984.559 --> 3995.329
great man

3992.25 --> 3995.329
[Music]

4004.839 --> 4009.359
it this is

4012.72 --> 4016.0
this is not about what we were talking

4014.48 --> 4019.2
about this is about

4016.0 --> 4022.88
fresh water versus salt water

4019.2 --> 4022.8799999999997
like at river situations

4026.799 --> 4031.0389999999998
atlantic and pacific oceans won't don't

4029.68 --> 4032.8799999999997
mix

4031.039 --> 4049.8390000000004
because of the saline content the

4032.88 --> 4049.839
average saline content

4062.48 --> 4077.839
right right anyway

4087.6 --> 4090.71
[Music]

4094.86 --> 4098.869
[Music]

4105.44 --> 4112.3189999999995
i don't know maybe maybe i should

4108.64 --> 4113.759
actually get to getting some guests back

4112.319 --> 4119.839000000001
on

4113.759 --> 4119.839
in this in the coming period

4120.08 --> 4124.719
what do you guys think i know i could

4122.239 --> 4127.04
have some of you on even if you like

4124.719 --> 4128.4800000000005
i haven't had a real gas on for a long

4127.04 --> 4131.839
time

4128.48 --> 4134.159
but i don't know i seem to have a lot of

4131.839 --> 4135.5199999999995
room basically and i'm trying to get an

4134.159 --> 4138.239
open discussion going

4135.52 --> 4138.2390000000005
with my chat

4140.88 --> 4147.839
did rodrigo come on

4143.92 --> 4147.839
uh i think he did

4150.0 --> 4152.96
i'm not sure though

4153.359 --> 4157.92
but if he did i i probably missed it

4158.0 --> 4162.48
hey what's that micro o'rourke

4166.96 --> 4175.839
watch your river

4178.48 --> 4181.839
oh yeah that's fascinating

4187.279 --> 4191.1990000000005
wow that is really fascinating

4192.239 --> 4196.4
that looks pretty astounding it's like a

4195.199 --> 4199.5199999999995
mist

4196.4 --> 4201.12
a blurry mist in the water that is

4199.52 --> 4203.76
really amazing side

4201.12 --> 4206.239
i've seen this before by the way but it

4203.76 --> 4208.8
just slipped my mind

4206.239 --> 4211.44
i think i might just thank you might

4208.8 --> 4211.4400000000005
show some

4212.32 --> 4230.159
at least some images

4216.4 --> 4232.32
hey what

4230.159 --> 4232.32
on

4237.44 --> 4245.839999999999
right just look at that it's pretty

4240.08 --> 4245.84
beautiful pictures

4255.12 --> 4259.36
that's yeah very cool then this is in a

4257.84 --> 4273.84
river

4259.36 --> 4273.839999999999
how bizarre is that

4276.32 --> 4281.679
yeah that's pretty cool thanks for that

4278.64 --> 4281.679
that that's a good link

4281.84 --> 4288.32
uh right but i'm gonna round out the

4286.48 --> 4291.36
show guys

4288.32 --> 4295.12
kind of getting kind of hungry

4291.36 --> 4297.36
and don't have not a lot of input

4295.12 --> 4299.199
