yeah yesterday was a rowdy rowdy ass day

173.68 --> 178.15900000000002

earth debates a little four hour show

181.2 --> 185.35999999999999
this time

182.879 --> 187.92
everybody was very rowdy and very

185.36 --> 189.76000000000002
rampassy and i was really holding back a

187.92 --> 192.07999999999998
lot

189.76 --> 193.84
because i i think i already threw out

192.08 --> 196.48000000000002
some of that [ __ ]

193.84 --> 200.239
basically ahead of schedule

196.48 --> 200.23899999999998
but everybody was just having a

202.159 --> 206.159
like tenth man and brian

207.92 --> 211.599
and it was a bit of a yeah kiwi was like

210.48 --> 215.84
way

211.599 --> 219.11999999999998
he was very flu yeah he was flustered

215.84 --> 221.44
with his agitation so it was very rowdy

219.12 --> 224.08
show but very interesting though and i

221.44 --> 227.84
had a i spontaneously came up with a

224.08 --> 229.76000000000002
great skit and asked nathan to make a

227.84 --> 231.44
short video out of it and he did and

229.76 --> 233.76
it's great

231.44 --> 236.76
it's great i love it have you guys seen

233.76 --> 236.76
it

240.799 --> 244.72
i love it i really like that that's out

243.04 --> 245.26
there that like that is the sort of

244.72 --> 247.12
stuff

245.26 --> 250.0
[Music]

247.12 --> 253.439
that my spontaneous

250.0 --> 257.439
joke comedy ideas are really exactly

253.439 --> 257.43899999999996
right for like that is exactly

260.0 --> 262.239
yeah

262.24 --> 269.84000000000003
what i had envisioned basically awesome

265.759 --> 269.84000000000003
let me find it back where the hell is it

277.84 --> 283.84
yeah darth vader versus luke vacuum

281.199 --> 283.84000000000003
walker

284.08 --> 289.52
a darth flat sorry

287.52 --> 291.03999999999996
yeah check it out

289.52 --> 294.03999999999996
it was at the end of the live show

291.04 --> 294.04
yesterday

307.199 --> 312.72
right yeah nathan came up with that

309.039 --> 312.71999999999997
title i came up with the skit

313.87 --> 317.84000000000003
[Music]

315.039 --> 318.71999999999997
but yeah very like that's an epic little

317.84 --> 320.479
thing

318.72 --> 324.84000000000003
that like that is a

320.479 --> 324.84
thing that's gonna find its way

327.759 --> 332.47900000000004
don't you do voice works on animated

330.08 --> 332.479
films

335.199 --> 341.199
perhaps got a lot of competition though

339.84 --> 344.71999999999997
and

341.199 --> 346.56
it's like my voice grain

344.72 --> 348.72
is not the best

346.56 --> 351.36
like i have the skill

348.72 --> 355.199
the dynamic it's just that my actual

351.36 --> 358.319
voice quality is i think

355.199 --> 358.319
not super great

360.0 --> 364.479
i i would say it's because of my smoking

362.24 --> 364.479
but

364.88 --> 371.28
it was always a bit like that

368.24 --> 372.479
it's just the way my voice is

371.28 --> 376.4
is not

372.479 --> 379.039
i i think not ideal for

376.4 --> 380.96
voiceovers of things but hey if

379.039 --> 383.36
somebody's like dude

380.96 --> 386.15999999999997
shut up or when you are exactly the

383.36 --> 388.56
voice i look i was looking for this is

386.16 --> 390.0
this is it could you do it i'd probably

388.56 --> 392.319
do it

390.0 --> 394.72
just for the excitement of it

392.319 --> 397.44
sure

394.72 --> 400.639
voice acting pace well yeah but there's

397.44 --> 401.84
a lot of competition and a lot of legend

400.639 --> 405.759
out there

401.84 --> 406.84
people that are really good at it

405.759 --> 408.8
so

406.84 --> 411.11999999999995
yeah

408.8 --> 412.88
it's like unless you're like welcomed

411.12 --> 414.8
into the circle

412.88 --> 419.08
and they really want you like this

414.8 --> 419.08
competition is just unimaginable

423.36 --> 428.88
right and most of the times like

426.08 --> 432.479
movie makers etc they want

428.88 --> 435.44
the voice actors the ones that have done

432.479 --> 438.31899999999996
it so many times and that just are great

435.44 --> 440.479
that's what they really want anyway so

438.319 --> 440.47900000000004
i

440.639 --> 445.68
i'm not saying i'd never do that

443.44 --> 450.4
but i'm just saying like oh i am going

445.68 --> 452.8
to be a voice actor that seems like a

450.4 --> 456.31899999999996
not a very happy career

452.8 --> 456.319
but if i just do that

457.759 --> 464.36
maybe maybe maybe not

461.039 --> 464.36
i don't know

465.28 --> 470.15999999999997
it really all depends on if somebody's

467.44 --> 470.16
gonna ask me

471.28 --> 476.87899999999996
but yeah i can do voices lots of them

474.16 --> 479.84000000000003
lots and lots of different voices i do a

476.879 --> 479.84000000000003
great column

480.879 --> 487.199
i could do a grappler

483.84 --> 489.75899999999996
and besides my voice usage is completely

487.199 --> 492.40000000000003
grafted in just my way of communication

489.759 --> 495.12
anyway

492.4 --> 498.56
when i feel

495.12 --> 498.56
like i can be myself

500.879 --> 506.319
i can withhold on the voices you know i

503.199 --> 508.8
can't just talk very straightforward

506.319 --> 509.91900000000004
i just yeah that's like

508.8 --> 512.719
anyway

509.919 --> 514.88
yeah anyway it was a great skit and very

512.719 --> 516.1590000000001
proud of it and it's it's fun because it

514.88 --> 518.8389999999999
just came

516.159 --> 520.479
so spontaneously

518.839 --> 523.519
literally

520.479 --> 523.519
i just thought of it

523.76 --> 529.279
i think i didn't i think of it even on

526.399 --> 529.279
my own show

530.08 --> 534.08
i haven't watched it back i might have

531.92 --> 537.04
actually made it up on my own show i

534.08 --> 537.0400000000001
forgot about that

538.399 --> 543.36
can i do an evil scientist voice you bet

540.959 --> 546.4799999999999
your ass i mean what type of evil

543.36 --> 546.48
scientist do you want

547.6 --> 552.8000000000001
i can do any form of evil scientist

553.92 --> 557.64
from any culture

562.48 --> 569.04
from silly to really like

565.92 --> 571.4399999999999
hollow out dark

569.04 --> 573.1999999999999
so yeah

571.44 --> 575.44
pure evil no

573.2 --> 577.839
i don't like that i don't like that sort

575.44 --> 577.839
of role

578.56 --> 583.04
no

580.64 --> 586.8
i'm just gonna do voices because you

583.04 --> 586.8
guys ask it that's not how i do it

589.44 --> 593.44
this is a show this is not a uh

595.36 --> 598.5600000000001
a job ad

603.44 --> 607.839
nobody tells me when to do voices you

605.92 --> 611.4399999999999
can ask me

607.839 --> 611.44
to contribute to a project

613.44 --> 618.5600000000001
but i don't just give it away unless i

616.48 --> 622.399
specifically feel like it which is

618.56 --> 622.399
usually when it's not asked for

627.04 --> 631.04
in other words you can't make me do

628.959 --> 632.8
voices

631.04 --> 635.4399999999999
i'm not a

632.8 --> 635.4399999999999
a puppet

645.36 --> 649.12
eric toby hated his voice now he's

647.279 --> 651.4399999999999
narrating videos

649.12 --> 655.04
being bee's knees yeah but that's

651.44 --> 658.9590000000001
different that's a reading voice he is a

655.04 --> 662.8389999999999
narrator a narrator is very different

658.959 --> 662.8389999999999
from a voice act

676.48 --> 681.9200000000001
right and besides eric dubay has worked

678.8 --> 685.04
a lot on his voice and on how he talks

681.92 --> 686.8389999999999
and he's done a great job i think

685.04 --> 690.399
like just

686.839 --> 692.8000000000001
compare the way his voice sounds

690.399 --> 696.32
like five years ago to now

692.8 --> 697.68
he's got so much more fluidity and just

696.32 --> 700.0
no

697.68 --> 700.0
sudden

700.959 --> 704.56
yeah it's just very smooth

707.44 --> 712.0
right but that's not

708.959 --> 714.6389999999999
yeah that's not the same as doing voices

712.0 --> 716.48
and besides that's what he does

714.639 --> 717.839
right just like i do

716.48 --> 719.76
what i do

717.839 --> 722.1600000000001
which is

719.76 --> 724.16
just direct

722.16 --> 728.7199999999999
face-to-face talking but over the

724.16 --> 728.7199999999999
internet it's like i simulate that

729.68 --> 733.519
it's very different

731.92 --> 736.56
much more

733.519 --> 738.639
interactive like that i mean eric debay

736.56 --> 741.1199999999999
reads and then he records and then he

738.639 --> 743.2
will cut things out of his recording and

741.12 --> 745.2
until he gets in right

743.2 --> 747.44
like writing a book except it's more

745.2 --> 750.399
like an audiobook so he's basically like

747.44 --> 750.399
an audiobook

751.839 --> 756.8800000000001
writer like that that's how he does it i

754.639 --> 759.839
do everything live

756.88 --> 759.8389999999999
always

761.16 --> 764.309
[Music]

783.76 --> 787.04
right anyway i

785.279 --> 789.279
don't think i've said hello to everybody

787.04 --> 789.279
yet

790.399 --> 794.16
scott first in chat gas jedo good to see

your lives are great

824.079 --> 830.7199999999999
are they yeah i mean

827.279 --> 830.72
i can't complain too much

831.04 --> 836.399
except about money of course but that's

833.44 --> 836.399
because of the setup

836.959 --> 840.3599999999999
hello leg

846.16 --> 849.4399999999999
right i just thought it was so

847.68 --> 851.68
interesting yesterday

849.44 --> 854.8000000000001
you know i'm always

851.68 --> 857.92
gazing at the energies that are being

854.8 --> 860.24
thrown out that are that i am that i

857.92 --> 863.5999999999999
basically catch and then react like

860.24 --> 865.44
yesterday i got so agitated

863.6 --> 867.839
it's like i got this beef and nothing

865.44 --> 870.1600000000001
even happened it was just old dirt that

867.839 --> 872.0790000000001
suddenly like came up like dust and it's

870.16 --> 874.24
just like i have to

872.079 --> 877.04
do this now i felt like i have to make

874.24 --> 877.04
this complaint

877.839 --> 884.48
and i was right on target not that i got

880.8 --> 887.199
attacked i wasn't really

884.48 --> 890.0
i kept myself held back a lot it's just

887.199 --> 893.519
that it really was one of those days and

890.0 --> 895.839
i totally called it i felt it

893.519 --> 899.279
and i expressed it

895.839 --> 902.48
i addressed the concern for which the

899.279 --> 905.68
chemistry typically was exactly there

902.48 --> 908.0
during the flat earth debate

905.68 --> 910.2399999999999
and it's really interesting to me that i

908.0 --> 913.48
could feel it i could feel what it was

910.24 --> 913.48
going to become

914.079 --> 916.8
although it

915.199 --> 919.199
went better

916.8 --> 921.92
even than anticipated maybe because i

919.199 --> 925.16
anticipated and this kit this kit was a

921.92 --> 925.16
real bonus

928.639 --> 934.48
the the flat fader and

931.759 --> 934.48
darth flat

934.639 --> 941.72
and luke vacuum walker

938.16 --> 941.7199999999999
exhausted two

946.079 --> 954.04
yeah it's in the evening right

949.04 --> 954.04
yeah this is your evening show i get it

956.88 --> 960.88
super exhausted today yeah okay

958.72 --> 963.279
classical that's so that's

960.88 --> 965.519
because i felt like that too like i woke

963.279 --> 967.68
up today and it was like

965.519 --> 970.5600000000001
uh

967.68 --> 972.8
like out of breath

970.56 --> 974.8
not literally because of oxygen surges

972.8 --> 976.88
but just that sensation of

974.8 --> 980.3199999999999
waking up and immediately being out of

976.88 --> 980.32
breath really annoying

980.8 --> 984.639
that's what slowed me down a bit even

983.199 --> 986.959
though i didn't even get up all that

984.639 --> 986.9590000000001
late

989.759 --> 994.48
also i think that most of my roommates

991.839 --> 994.48
have returned

994.72 --> 997.72
uh

1002.399 --> 1005.92
hey x320

1009.12 --> 1013.759
right so yesterday and today it's like a

1011.68 --> 1016.959
swing

1013.759 --> 1019.1990000000001
maybe it is the

1016.959 --> 1021.1199999999999
i've heard other people say that like

1019.199 --> 1023.199
yeah this is actually the turning point

1021.12 --> 1025.839
for the summer where now it's just not

1023.199 --> 1029.12
going to be extremely hot anymore

1025.839 --> 1031.6789999999999
and maybe that is what we felt maybe we

1029.12 --> 1034.3999999999999
got the last squeeze of it of that

1031.679 --> 1037.679
summer peak energy yesterday and we got

1034.4 --> 1039.039
all rowdy about it typical summer heat

1037.679 --> 1041.199
energy

1039.039 --> 1044.319
and today it's like boom

1041.199 --> 1044.319
a little depleted

1046.72 --> 1051.24
so maybe that's what's going on here

1052.24 --> 1055.039
george sanford

1056.24 --> 1061.28
yeah

1058.32 --> 1064.0
hey lynn lenox

1061.28 --> 1066.559
yeah good to see you

1064.0 --> 1068.64
i hope all is well yeah

1066.559 --> 1071.039
actually in this

1068.64 --> 1073.1200000000001
this last week i've been probably doing

1071.039 --> 1076.8799999999999
better than a long time

1073.12 --> 1079.8799999999999
i've had a lot of unexpected support

1076.88 --> 1079.88
and

1081.679 --> 1086.64
that's done just a more remarkable job

1084.799 --> 1089.28
in stabilizing

1086.64 --> 1090.4
like background clutter psychological

1089.28 --> 1092.3999999999999
for me

1090.4 --> 1095.1200000000001
while at the same time i have been

1092.4 --> 1097.8400000000001
building and like going systematically

1095.12 --> 1101.9189999999999
at everything

1097.84 --> 1104.6399999999999
idea-wise in the show and

1101.919 --> 1107.1200000000001
social interactions

1104.64 --> 1110.48
trying to branch out like finding jim

1107.12 --> 1112.799
bob it's been a real blessing

1110.48 --> 1112.799
uh

1114.64 --> 1119.8400000000001
right what was i gonna say

1116.799 --> 1122.559
right yeah i've been building that

1119.84 --> 1125.12
and then in combination with just not

1122.559 --> 1127.28
like knowing like oh finally

1125.12 --> 1128.6399999999999
there's like a lot of hope and then

1127.28 --> 1130.6399999999999
suddenly

1128.64 --> 1132.64
when all that background clutter just

1130.64 --> 1137.16
falls away

1132.64 --> 1137.16
it's like the magic starts happening

1137.28 --> 1141.2
and i just do things like making that

1139.679 --> 1144.16
skit

1141.2 --> 1146.4
yesterday it just happens

1144.16 --> 1149.64
and i think that is really because of

1146.4 --> 1155.2800000000002
the combination

1149.64 --> 1156.88
[Music]

1155.28 --> 1158.799
what

1156.88 --> 1160.48
you're blocking the son of da come on

1158.799 --> 1163.36
susie

1160.48 --> 1165.28
oh in australia hmm

1163.36 --> 1168.6789999999999
well it is winter

1165.28 --> 1168.6789999999999
there so

1183.44 --> 1188.559
right okay

1185.2 --> 1188.559
they look electrical

1188.64 --> 1192.4
are you talking about the celestials

1194.16 --> 1198.0800000000002
right there was a that was the primary

1196.4 --> 1199.76
discussion yesterday on the flyers

1198.08 --> 1201.6789999999999
debate

1199.76 --> 1204.1589999999999
it was

1201.679 --> 1208.0
about the sun and in this case

1204.159 --> 1212.0800000000002
presupposing like what if it was plasma

1208.0 --> 1213.12
i had i held back like an hour straight

1212.08 --> 1215.4399999999998
guys

1213.12 --> 1217.52
i did not even mention the word

1215.44 --> 1221.039
holographic

1217.52 --> 1223.44
as a complaint not even once

1221.039 --> 1225.679
and i'm kind of proud of that

1223.44 --> 1227.6000000000001
i did mention like yeah everybody knows

1225.679 --> 1229.76
that i have

1227.6 --> 1232.0
that i've i'm thinking about that but

1229.76 --> 1236.1589999999999
i'm not gonna do that

1232.0 --> 1238.48
but yeah the whole plasma exploration

1236.159 --> 1240.5590000000002
it was a bit messy but it was really

1238.48 --> 1242.559
interesting it was just an interesting

1240.559 --> 1246.24
thought experiment at the flat earth

1242.559 --> 1246.24
debates i think it was still in the live

1246.84 --> 1252.08
part but it might have been after i'm

1249.2 --> 1252.0800000000002
not sure anymore

1255.12 --> 1258.12
right

1267.12 --> 1271.559
it was after okay right thanks

1277.2 --> 1282.48
yeah for me you know sometimes it's like

1280.0 --> 1285.039
the exact timing is a real difficult for

1282.48 --> 1285.919
me difficulty and even in retrospect

1285.039 --> 1288.72
like

1285.919 --> 1291.1200000000001
from things that happened long time ago

1288.72 --> 1292.96
i'm very good at remembering

1291.12 --> 1296.32
that something happened

1292.96 --> 1299.28
but it's like a box a lego sometimes in

1296.32 --> 1300.3999999999999
my mind i don't necessarily know exactly

1299.28 --> 1301.6789999999999
the

1300.4 --> 1303.2800000000002
the order

1301.679 --> 1305.679
it's just i know the things and then

1303.28 --> 1307.76
it's like i sort of have to make it fit

1305.679 --> 1309.039
in a logical fashion and i have to make

1307.76 --> 1313.28
do because

1309.039 --> 1315.12
i don't exactly have like time memory

1313.28 --> 1318.6399999999999
other there's some people out there that

1315.12 --> 1321.12
do they have great time precision memory

1318.64 --> 1322.96
i don't have that i just have content

1321.12 --> 1325.84
memory a lot

1322.96 --> 1325.8400000000001
and structure

1326.0 --> 1331.12
like overall structure but not like

1329.919 --> 1334.64
time

1331.12 --> 1336.32
anchored structure that thing is just it

1334.64 --> 1338.0
doesn't really work that well with me

1336.32 --> 1340.3999999999999
never has

1338.0 --> 1343.84
like even when i was very young

1340.4 --> 1343.8400000000001
i had a lot of trouble with that

1344.88 --> 1347.8400000000001
timing

1349.6 --> 1353.12
that's the last way no hello gadget

1351.52 --> 1355.36
inspector

1353.12 --> 1360.28
tomenoid2

1355.36 --> 1360.28
plasma is ionized gas yes

1361.12 --> 1365.9189999999999
but it is has been said to be a state of

1363.679 --> 1369.2
matter and that is also what qe was

1365.919 --> 1369.2
going by in the argument

1369.52 --> 1375.2
that it is a different state of matter

1371.44 --> 1378.0800000000002
but yeah that remains to be disputed and

1375.2 --> 1380.48
it was being disputed during the show

1378.08 --> 1383.12
like isn't it just a gas that is being

1380.48 --> 1383.1200000000001
ionized

1385.2 --> 1388.72
right

1386.799 --> 1391.28
but it was an interesting point overall

1388.72 --> 1393.679
trying to compare it to lightning

1391.28 --> 1395.6789999999999
right the sun might be like lightning

1393.679 --> 1398.5590000000002
that's continually going and it's like

1395.679 --> 1398.5590000000002
okay so

1398.72 --> 1404.559
what is it discharging into

1402.72 --> 1406.24
i mean lightning is connecting to the

1404.559 --> 1408.559
earth it's discharging that's what

1406.24 --> 1410.32
causing the energy and the effective

1408.559 --> 1411.12
plasma moment

1410.32 --> 1414.3999999999999
so

1411.12 --> 1417.84
where is the sun exactly discharging to

1414.4 --> 1421.2
in order to

1417.84 --> 1424.08
keep that enormous plasma light effect

1421.2 --> 1425.3600000000001
going perpetually

1424.08 --> 1427.52
where is it

1425.36 --> 1430.24
where is it discharging i mean there

1427.52 --> 1433.279
must be like a permanent lightning storm

1430.24 --> 1435.039
upwards against the dome or something

1433.279 --> 1438.64
it's like something on the fly would

1435.039 --> 1441.36
just conjure up as a response because

1438.64 --> 1445.3600000000001
like if you're gonna compare

1441.36 --> 1446.4799999999998
the sun to literal lightning then

1445.36 --> 1447.52
yeah

1446.48 --> 1449.2
well

1447.52 --> 1450.8799999999999
where are the elements for that where's

1449.2 --> 1453.76
the discharge

1450.88 --> 1453.7600000000002
how is it doing that

1455.52 --> 1459.36
right

1456.64 --> 1460.88
but if it's holographic

1459.36 --> 1462.559
i think it is

1460.88 --> 1463.3600000000001
that doesn't have an actual location

1462.559 --> 1465.9189999999999
then

1463.36 --> 1468.559
the entire light effect

1465.919 --> 1470.0
could basically be an electrically

1468.559 --> 1471.279
fueled

1470.0 --> 1474.96
but

1471.279 --> 1477.52
positionally displaced effect

1474.96 --> 1480.4
in the sense that

1477.52 --> 1482.6399999999999
it's like a projection

1480.4 --> 1486.96
plasma hologram no

1482.64 --> 1489.1200000000001
no that makes no sense a hologram is not

1486.96 --> 1492.159
is an image of light that's it

1489.12 --> 1495.36
it's just a light based effect

1492.159 --> 1498.159
it's not actually the matter

1495.36 --> 1500.559
like plasma plasma is matter

1498.159 --> 1502.0800000000002
it would make it local because plasma is

1500.559 --> 1504.8799999999999
like a lamp

1502.08 --> 1507.9189999999999
it will give light in a position that

1504.88 --> 1510.4
gives the light right so a hologram is

1507.919 --> 1512.7990000000002
just something that

1510.4 --> 1516.5590000000002
is making you have light received to

1512.799 --> 1518.72
your eyes in that in that setup

1516.559 --> 1520.96
doesn't actually mean that there is an

1518.72 --> 1523.44
object there that is even the source of

1520.96 --> 1524.32
that light

1523.44 --> 1527.1200000000001
that it

1524.32 --> 1531.039
is exactly there where you see it right

1527.12 --> 1534.9599999999998
so that's the big difference

1531.039 --> 1537.84
i do not have the discharge issue of the

1534.96 --> 1540.64
plasma sun with the holographic sun

1537.84 --> 1544.3999999999999
because it nothing has to literally be

1540.64 --> 1547.2
in that place and it wouldn't be

1544.4 --> 1550.159
it would just have to be enough energy

1547.2 --> 1550.96
present somewhere everywhere perhaps

1550.159 --> 1554.64
right

1550.96 --> 1557.44
i guess it's more ether compatible

1554.64 --> 1559.5200000000002
i have to be energy anywhere that just

1557.44 --> 1561.1200000000001
enables

1559.52 --> 1564.559
that effect

1561.12 --> 1564.559
well yeah to manifest

1568.88 --> 1574.0
what fuels it yeah you know what fuels

1571.039 --> 1576.1589999999999
the sun what what actually fuels this

1574.0 --> 1578.72
non-local hologram

1576.159 --> 1580.48
what actually fuels it is it

1578.72 --> 1583.039
an outside thing

1580.48 --> 1587.1200000000001
like god

1583.039 --> 1590.0
that just inserts that energy somehow

1587.12 --> 1593.1999999999998
or is there an interaction

1590.0 --> 1596.32
a feedback loop with

1593.2 --> 1596.32
things in the earth

1596.88 --> 1601.1200000000001
is the earth is there something

1598.559 --> 1603.84
electromagnetic

1601.12 --> 1609.12
or magnetic in general

1603.84 --> 1610.84
feeding it or is it like the bio energy

1609.12 --> 1613.2399999999998
like is energy

1610.84 --> 1616.32
present everywhere

1613.24 --> 1617.279
simultaneously is that like a battery

1616.32 --> 1620.08
feed

1617.279 --> 1623.919
to the non-local hologram light effect i

1620.08 --> 1627.6789999999999
mean it is a reasonable idea to ponder

1623.919 --> 1631.3600000000001
upon whether that could be true

1627.679 --> 1631.3600000000001
it would certainly be testable

1631.76 --> 1635.919
let's not go there

1633.679 --> 1637.3600000000001
that would be very manipulating the

1635.919 --> 1641.0800000000002
amount of life

1637.36 --> 1641.08
if you know what i mean

1643.919 --> 1647.76
right

1645.279 --> 1650.159
but what if for example more the more

1647.76 --> 1652.96
life there is the more celestial

1650.159 --> 1657.2
hologram energy is invoked

1652.96 --> 1659.6000000000001
more life more son less life lesson

1657.2 --> 1661.6000000000001
that could be a thing i don't know it's

1659.6 --> 1666.08
just pure speculation

1661.6 --> 1666.08
but it's not unreasonable to ponder upon

1666.96 --> 1672.3990000000001
right so either it's completely

1669.44 --> 1675.76
externally infused or it is internally

1672.399 --> 1679.7199999999998
infused from the earth realm

1675.76 --> 1679.72
it's gonna be either way

1683.679 --> 1687.3600000000001
reality could get start getting

1685.679 --> 1689.6000000000001
non-material

1687.36 --> 1689.6
no

1691.12 --> 1696.399
now that's

1692.64 --> 1698.5590000000002
that's that's not compatible

1696.399 --> 1700.4799999999998
material is the material but that

1698.559 --> 1702.8799999999999
doesn't mean that all things that we get

1700.48 --> 1705.3600000000001
to see are material i mean our dreams

1702.88 --> 1708.24
aren't material

1705.36 --> 1710.4799999999998
and i argue that the celestial lights

1708.24 --> 1713.919
aren't material they're light

1710.48 --> 1716.159
but not material as we think of

1713.919 --> 1719.1200000000001
it basically

1716.159 --> 1721.919
right you could say light is material in

1719.12 --> 1724.8799999999999
a sense not a material it is

1721.919 --> 1729.2
material it is perceivable testable it

1724.88 --> 1729.2
has an influence variable variable

1729.6 --> 1736.559
variable and manipulatable right

1733.6 --> 1740.1589999999999
but it's not literal substance

1736.559 --> 1742.8799999999999
it is not me has no mass and it has

1740.159 --> 1745.8400000000001
no speed it's instantaneous

1742.88 --> 1745.8400000000001
it's really weird

1747.679 --> 1751.2
right

1749.84 --> 1753.6
but

1751.2 --> 1756.799
yeah there's no vector that if you like

1753.6 --> 1760.24
go upward that suddenly things become

1756.799 --> 1762.32
like a dream or something

1760.24 --> 1766.159
right physically that's that's not gonna

1762.32 --> 1767.52
happen that's too much fantasy

1766.159 --> 1769.919
movies

1767.52 --> 1769.9189999999999
maybe

1776.48 --> 1781.1200000000001
right but the celestials are extremely

1778.88 --> 1784.48
interesting they are the few things that

1781.12 --> 1784.4799999999998
do actually persist

1785.039 --> 1787.6
up there

1787.919 --> 1792.3990000000001
i mean there's literally nothing up

1789.679 --> 1793.919
there except thin gas

1792.399 --> 1796.1589999999999
but there's still celestial light

1793.919 --> 1798.64
manifestations that is really

1796.159 --> 1799.6000000000001
fascinating that makes them like one of

1798.64 --> 1800.64
the

1799.6 --> 1802.9599999999998
unique

1800.64 --> 1804.96
sources of

1802.96 --> 1806.64
occurrences

1804.96 --> 1809.8400000000001
phenomenon

1806.64 --> 1809.8400000000001
up there

1823.2 --> 1827.3600000000001
higher voltage tire yes len lenox that's

1825.84 --> 1829.1999999999998
right

1827.36 --> 1831.76
but

1829.2 --> 1834.8400000000001
that tension hanging there

1831.76 --> 1836.48
is not going to be able to basically

1834.84 --> 1840.1589999999999
feed

1836.48 --> 1841.6
a light manifestation a energy

1840.159 --> 1845.1200000000001
point of light

1841.6 --> 1846.8799999999999
plasmic or otherwise without discharge

1845.12 --> 1849.6789999999999
right and with discharge comes

1846.88 --> 1851.0390000000002
dissipation

1849.679 --> 1854.0800000000002
so

1851.039 --> 1857.36
this idea that there's all this

1854.08 --> 1861.039
energy in the air is true but it's uh

1857.36 --> 1861.039
it's non-tapped energy

1862.0 --> 1865.159
you see

1865.84 --> 1869.36
it's it's not actually discharging it's

1868.559 --> 1872.24
just

1869.36 --> 1872.24
sitting in there

1876.799 --> 1881.12
right because if it would be discharging

1879.2 --> 1884.3990000000001
we would be able to measure that because

1881.12 --> 1886.08
then the charge drops

1884.399 --> 1887.6789999999999
that's what happens just like with a

1886.08 --> 1889.4399999999998
lightning strike

1887.679 --> 1890.3200000000002
tension builds up

1889.44 --> 1893.519
bang

1890.32 --> 1895.84
connection discharge lights

1893.519 --> 1897.039
violence and then

1895.84 --> 1899.039
electric

1897.039 --> 1900.799
discharge depletion

1899.039 --> 1903.919
no more tension

1900.799 --> 1903.9189999999999
that's how that works

1904.48 --> 1909.44
discharge is lightning yeah

1907.679 --> 1910.5590000000002
it's the moment where the tension builds

1909.44 --> 1914.159
up enough

1910.559 --> 1916.1589999999999
to be able to create that connection

1914.159 --> 1919.279
that then creates the plasma and the

1916.159 --> 1922.0
explosive sound of lightning

1919.279 --> 1924.399
and by that connection there is the

1922.0 --> 1925.76
discharge that means that the

1924.399 --> 1927.039
energy

1925.76 --> 1929.84
connects

1927.039 --> 1931.84
and then the tension's gone

1929.84 --> 1932.6399999999999
at least in that moment it might rebuild

1931.84 --> 1934.6399999999999
up

1932.64 --> 1938.3600000000001
but that's what it is

1934.64 --> 1938.3600000000001
lightning is discharged

1948.399 --> 1954.36
flat earth philosophy youtube no

1951.12 --> 1954.36
no no

1970.96 --> 1975.3600000000001
living in a dream simulation or westwood

1973.919 --> 1977.2
likes and i know that's what you're

1975.36 --> 1979.279
creating for yourself that's your sub

1977.2 --> 1983.519
simulation it's because of the culture

1979.279 --> 1983.519
that we live in today we all do this now

1984.96 --> 1988.72
you might feel because you're in a

1986.64 --> 1991.919
simulation

1988.72 --> 1994.64
because you are participating in

1991.919 --> 1996.5590000000002
virtually learning to simulate things in

1994.64 --> 1997.8400000000001
your mind so yeah oh you feel you're in

1996.559 --> 1999.6789999999999
stimulation it's because you're

1997.84 --> 2001.519
simulating

1999.679 --> 2003.1200000000001
that's why you feel that

2001.519 --> 2004.88
you're trying to figure it out you're

2003.12 --> 2006.08
trying to simulate it in your head yeah

2004.88 --> 2008.7990000000002
you're going to feel like you're in a

2006.08 --> 2008.799
simulation

2009.84 --> 2013.36
i feel like i'm in a simulation all the

2011.84 --> 2015.6789999999999
time

2013.36 --> 2018.6789999999999
but i also compartmentalize that

2015.679 --> 2018.679
sensation

2019.039 --> 2024.399
because i know it is a simulation

2022.399 --> 2027.12
in my mind

2024.399 --> 2029.1999999999998
i'm not gonna let it convince me that

2027.12 --> 2033.76
that means that everything in the

2029.2 --> 2036.96
physical reality itself is a simulation

2033.76 --> 2038.08
i'm not gonna let my own perception fool

2036.96 --> 2041.48
me

2038.08 --> 2041.48
in that sense

2049.159 --> 2052.319
[Music]

2093.359 --> 2096.359
what

2133.359 --> 2137.52
if we are electrical readings that trims

2135.52 --> 2140.56
me out sometimes

2137.52 --> 2142.24
yeah well every time you get excited you

2140.56 --> 2145.839
heat up why do you think you heat up

2142.24 --> 2145.839
it's electrical energy

2149.68 --> 2155.1189999999997
right

2151.52 --> 2157.7599999999998
just like passionate love is energy it's

2155.119 --> 2159.52
electric energy i mean when we get

2157.76 --> 2161.0400000000004
energy what type of energy do you think

2159.52 --> 2163.68
that is do you think there's literal

2161.04 --> 2164.64
combustion happening in your body

2163.68 --> 2167.839
no

2164.64 --> 2167.839
it's electrical

2169.68 --> 2175.04
it's like an electromagnetic field it's

2172.4 --> 2175.04
measurable

2182.88 --> 2186.52
okay turret

2190.47 --> 2194.1299999999997
[Music]

2196.079 --> 2201.44
i really like that idea by the way that

2198.48 --> 2202.96
we are electrical it always reminds me

2201.44 --> 2204.64
it makes me

2202.96 --> 2206.32
think about

2204.64 --> 2208.4
like zeus

2206.32 --> 2210.7200000000003
and how he's like

2208.4 --> 2214.96
an electric being

2210.72 --> 2217.839
and that yeah maybe we are all

2214.96 --> 2220.32
or a lot of us are like far-related

2217.839 --> 2222.96
for a distant related to zeus in that

2220.32 --> 2226.0
sense is that that electrical energy

2222.96 --> 2228.4
potential he was just like

2226.0 --> 2232.92
the pinnacle of it

2228.4 --> 2232.92
like the ultimate tension potential

2243.28 --> 2250.28
that's no terry that's not

2245.839 --> 2250.2799999999997
the hell are you bringing that up for

2304.72 --> 2307.72
hmm

2313.599 --> 2318.32
but who is saying that george sanford

2316.079 --> 2320.0
who is actually saying that who is day

2318.32 --> 2321.92
in this case saying there is no

2320.0 --> 2324.56
advancements in the electrical field who

2321.92 --> 2327.04
is saying that

2324.56 --> 2330.04
you know i haven't heard anybody say

2327.04 --> 2330.04
that

2349.839 --> 2355.2
i mean how do you think that like

2352.079 --> 2357.92
computer chip technology advancing

2355.2 --> 2360.96
how do you think that's happening

2357.92 --> 2363.359
through electrics and it's still going i

2360.96 --> 2365.119
mean it's gonna probably hit its peak at

2363.359 --> 2367.2799999999997
some point

2365.119 --> 2367.28
but

2367.52 --> 2371.599
yeah

2369.04 --> 2372.96
who says there is no advancement in the

2371.599 --> 2377.32
electric field

2372.96 --> 2377.32
who actually says that george sanford

2413.04 --> 2418.72
they keep it away from the public you

2415.04 --> 2418.72
mean industrial secrecy

2419.44 --> 2423.28
that's

2421.04 --> 2425.119
that's just industrial secrecy yeah

2423.28 --> 2427.0400000000004
they're not gonna

2425.119 --> 2429.6800000000003
get their amazing

2427.04 --> 2432.079
profit yielding findings and they just

2429.68 --> 2435.2799999999997
throw it out there no that that's called

2432.079 --> 2435.28
industrial secrecy

2436.24 --> 2441.52
that doesn't mean that people say there

2439.68 --> 2443.2799999999997
is no advancement

2441.52 --> 2445.7599999999998
i mean everybody know there is

2443.28 --> 2448.2400000000002
advancement and everybody knows

2445.76 --> 2450.48
it's being applied pretty much

2448.24 --> 2452.7999999999997
it's they're not just overtly telling

2450.48 --> 2454.88
everybody

2452.8 --> 2458.88
but it is there and it is being applied

2454.88 --> 2458.88
and it is being developed constantly

2463.68 --> 2468.0789999999997
i mean this is basically

2465.68 --> 2470.64
a tesla era

2468.079 --> 2473.28
oh look what we got there's like

2470.64 --> 2474.0789999999997
directed energy weapons

2473.28 --> 2475.599
there's

2474.079 --> 2478.88
hyper

2475.599 --> 2478.88
micro electronics

2479.28 --> 2482.7200000000003
there is

2481.04 --> 2484.24
medical

2482.72 --> 2486.8799999999997
research

2484.24 --> 2488.56
with electrics like i've been part of

2486.88 --> 2490.96
that

2488.56 --> 2490.96
it's like

2493.04 --> 2501.839
therapies using electrics not shock

2496.079 --> 2501.8390000000004
therapy but just actual viable therapies

2502.16 --> 2507.2799999999997
so dude there's been so much development

2505.2 --> 2510.0
in electrics

2507.28 --> 2512.3190000000004
i don't know anybody that says there is

2510.0 --> 2518.28
no development in it i've never heard

2512.319 --> 2518.2799999999997
anybody say that to me in my life

2538.56 --> 2542.44
hey seeking star wars

2561.52 --> 2566.64
yeah a uh sir little wolf it's very cute

2564.88 --> 2568.96
that you think you're a puppy and all

2566.64 --> 2572.64
that but uh

2568.96 --> 2572.64
this is not a show for dogs

2573.28 --> 2577.92
we we talk about actual human issues

2576.16 --> 2580.48
here

2577.92 --> 2584.079
we're not here to entertain somebody's

2580.48 --> 2584.079
own role-playing weirdness

2584.48 --> 2588.04
if you don't mind

2604.839 --> 2609.119
no

2606.4 --> 2609.119
no it's not

2613.92 --> 2617.16
go away

2632.319 --> 2635.92
yeah

2633.359 --> 2637.119
i'm sorry but dogs have to go out in the

2635.92 --> 2640.7200000000003
shed

2637.119 --> 2642.96
there's no dogs inside the workshop yeah

2640.72 --> 2646.16
don't want any drool and dog hairs

2642.96 --> 2648.88
everywhere it's just no

2646.16 --> 2651.7599999999998
like what if you get glue stuck on you

2648.88 --> 2654.0
or something like no

2651.76 --> 2657.48
dogs go outside

2654.0 --> 2657.48
that's the rule

2675.52 --> 2677.839
what

2683.599 --> 2687.119
yeah guys he was trying to invoke puppy

2685.76 --> 2687.92
play it's

2687.119 --> 2691.44
just

2687.92 --> 2694.56
get out of here man

2691.44 --> 2696.7200000000003
i mean please seek out your designated

2694.56 --> 2699.119
safe space for that [ __ ]

2696.72 --> 2700.64
yeah this is the freaking early bird

2699.119 --> 2703.839
show

2700.64 --> 2705.7599999999998
not your weird little

2703.839 --> 2708.0
role play

2705.76 --> 2711.0400000000004
[ __ ] this is not a theater

2708.0 --> 2711.04
joe this is

2712.16 --> 2715.16
uh

2721.839 --> 2729.56
right that's a weird dream the goods

2725.52 --> 2729.56
but to replace doorknobs

2733.92 --> 2738.48
that sounds sort of like that would be

2736.319 --> 2739.599
like a sort of weird chinese thing

2738.48 --> 2742.8
almost

2739.599 --> 2745.44
like that yeah i could see the ccp just

2742.8 --> 2747.119
ordering like oh everybody has to have

2745.44 --> 2749.119
these doorknobs

2747.119 --> 2750.6800000000003
and the doorknobs automatically have

2749.119 --> 2753.119
just

2750.68 --> 2754.3999999999996
identification print that immediately

2753.119 --> 2757.92
passes on

2754.4 --> 2758.7200000000003
that information to the the party

2757.92 --> 2761.2000000000003
right

2758.72 --> 2763.4399999999996
that sort of [ __ ] like the doorknob

2761.2 --> 2765.4399999999996
itself would just be a standardized

2763.44 --> 2767.599
identification system and you're not

2765.44 --> 2771.04
allowed to take it off and if it breaks

2767.599 --> 2774.56
you must call the repairman and all that

2771.04 --> 2775.7599999999998
and that it would be mandatory ugh

2774.56 --> 2777.44
yeah

2775.76 --> 2780.0
i couldn't imagine the dream like that

2777.44 --> 2780.0
the goods

2780.4 --> 2783.6800000000003
i

2781.68 --> 2785.359
no way in hell that that would ever

2783.68 --> 2790.8799999999997
happen in here by the way in the

2785.359 --> 2790.88
netherlands not now hopefully never

2794.48 --> 2798.319
yeah by the way

2796.0 --> 2800.8
like one of my

2798.319 --> 2800.8
favorite

2800.839 --> 2806.0789999999997
characters from the forum for democracy

2803.839 --> 2806.0789999999997
here

2806.16 --> 2810.0
said something

2807.68 --> 2811.9199999999996
yesterday or the day before i don't know

2810.0 --> 2814.4
i retweeted it

2811.92 --> 2816.88
but he literally said like we have to

2814.4 --> 2819.04
get militant about this and i really

2816.88 --> 2821.52
like that

2819.04 --> 2824.24
he dared to go there

2821.52 --> 2824.24
and he's right

2825.359 --> 2829.7599999999998
it's all dutch but

2827.68 --> 2831.9199999999996
just yeah

2829.76 --> 2835.8390000000004
i always look out for those things for

2831.92 --> 2839.359
for those calls that like yeah this

2835.839 --> 2841.839
this is not a joke anymore guys

2839.359 --> 2844.72
like this we are literally entering a

2841.839 --> 2846.5589999999997
civil war stage

2844.72 --> 2849.1189999999997
it's just not

2846.559 --> 2852.2400000000002
like in the movies

2849.119 --> 2855.44
it's psychological civil war but it is

2852.24 --> 2859.5589999999997
war it and really like you're forced to

2855.44 --> 2859.559
go there or you fall

2861.2 --> 2864.3999999999996
this is very serious

2864.96 --> 2867.599
a human right

2866.8 --> 2869.6800000000003
no

2867.599 --> 2872.8
it's not a human right

2869.68 --> 2875.7599999999998
it's a duty to god

2872.8 --> 2875.76
human rights

2884.16 --> 2889.359
but yeah

2885.52 --> 2889.359
good fair enough that face

2893.76 --> 2898.7200000000003
your karma ran over your dogma a long

2896.48 --> 2898.72
time

2898.839 --> 2905.5589999999997
that's that's very witty of you seeking

2902.24 --> 2905.5589999999997
star wars

2944.0 --> 2947.44
didn't know your religious has nothing

2945.68 --> 2949.9199999999996
to do with religion

2947.44 --> 2951.68
has to do with our design

2949.92 --> 2954.88
that face

2951.68 --> 2957.2
duty to god is not duty

2954.88 --> 2959.119
to some guy with a special ring and a

2957.2 --> 2960.96
special hat

2959.119 --> 2965.52
yeah it's too

2960.96 --> 2967.599
the unnecessary antecedent for existence

2965.52 --> 2970.079
the designer

2967.599 --> 2973.2000000000003
god

2970.079 --> 2974.2400000000002
god is just a word

2973.2 --> 2978.359
what

2974.24 --> 2978.359
it's what the word means

2987.359 --> 2992.24
god is a religious construct no

2990.0 --> 2994.319
it isn't

2992.24 --> 2997.319
god is a necessary antecedent for

2994.319 --> 2997.319
existence

2999.92 --> 3003.76
i'm sorry at first i do not believe in a

3002.319 --> 3006.8
witch god

3003.76 --> 3006.8
i believe in god

3009.119 --> 3014.7200000000003
yeah

3010.64 --> 3016.64
god does not abide by your iconography

3014.72 --> 3018.8799999999997
or personification

3016.64 --> 3022.839
you petty human

3018.88 --> 3022.839
god is all

3031.38 --> 3035.44
[Music]

3032.72 --> 3037.7599999999998
oh thank you at phrase i didn't read

3035.44 --> 3037.76
that

3038.24 --> 3044.4799999999996
i misread that of course because i'm an

3040.559 --> 3045.92
idiot and i misread things like that

3044.48 --> 3048.92
yes

3045.92 --> 3048.92
no

3062.88 --> 3066.839
it sounded like i did

3064.72 --> 3069.839
well no it

3066.839 --> 3071.92
sounded what you did that like it did

3069.839 --> 3074.72
sound like that that's

3071.92 --> 3077.119
why i said it with a slight little twist

3074.72 --> 3079.68
even though i didn't even say it you

3077.119 --> 3083.2000000000003
heard it in what i said

3079.68 --> 3086.3999999999996
because i heard that in what you said

3083.2 --> 3089.1189999999997
and i expressed that

3086.4 --> 3089.119
and you heard

3094.839 --> 3098.92
it yeah

3128.0 --> 3135.76
no at face

3129.68 --> 3135.7599999999998
god not any god not witch god god

3136.0 --> 3139.839
the designer the one

3148.4 --> 3152.7200000000003
to name him is to

3150.8 --> 3155.8390000000004
degrade

3152.72 --> 3159.52
today mr degrade

3155.839 --> 3164.68
to personify to iconographies

3159.52 --> 3164.68
don't do it specifically warn against

3171.92 --> 3175.44
yeah but that's because you're talking

3173.68 --> 3177.68
to them

3175.44 --> 3179.76
like they're talking about a person you

3177.68 --> 3182.5589999999997
stupid idiot

3179.76 --> 3184.7200000000003
they're not talking about a person

3182.559 --> 3186.559
you think like that because you're a

3184.72 --> 3189.2799999999997
[ __ ] idiot

3186.559 --> 3192.0
you don't understand anything about the

3189.28 --> 3192.0
creator

3192.079 --> 3197.28
so you're just treating it like it's an

3194.079 --> 3199.52
imaginary person because you're an idiot

3197.28 --> 3200.8
and you learn to worship from watching

3199.52 --> 3204.4
tv

3200.8 --> 3208.92
like any atheist idiot

3204.4 --> 3208.92
yeah it's not what we're talking about

3210.64 --> 3216.4
the creator there's only one

3214.48 --> 3218.079
the designer

3216.4 --> 3222.559
one

3218.079 --> 3224.8
has no name one the designer the him

3222.559 --> 3226.7200000000003
it he did it

3224.8 --> 3229.92
he's outside still

3226.72 --> 3231.68
he designed it throughout all time

3229.92 --> 3233.04
he planted he created the akashic

3231.68 --> 3235.839
library

3233.04 --> 3238.319
we get our information thanks to his

3235.839 --> 3238.319
design

3239.2 --> 3245.4399999999996
the creator he has no name

3242.64 --> 3245.44
no image

3245.599 --> 3248.599
nothing

3255.68 --> 3261.52
names and images are all designations

3259.44 --> 3265.2000000000003
for the realm

3261.52 --> 3267.28
he is outside the realm

3265.2 --> 3270.16
i'm calling him a he

3267.28 --> 3272.0
that's more like a political choice

3270.16 --> 3272.8799999999997
than anything because

3272.0 --> 3277.04
he

3272.88 --> 3279.2000000000003
has no designation he has not been

3277.04 --> 3280.799
influenced tainted

3279.2 --> 3284.0
in his fabric

3280.799 --> 3286.559
in the fabric of his being

3284.0 --> 3289.92
through the interaction

3286.559 --> 3293.8390000000004
with the realm all these details are our

3289.92 --> 3293.839
experience not his

3296.64 --> 3300.7599999999998
he just designed it

3312.4 --> 3317.599
creator is not female

3315.04 --> 3320.16
or male i already told you

3317.599 --> 3322.799
i call him a he because of a political

3320.16 --> 3325.52

i [ __ ] choose to it's a he

blasphemy

3454.88 --> 3460.1600000000003
yeah probably i mean you are overtly

3457.92 --> 3464.079
lying and double speaking and saying

3460.16 --> 3465.7599999999998
something and then denying it after that

3464.079 --> 3467.76
yeah

3465.76 --> 3470.4
yeah i'd say anti-flat earth would be

3467.76 --> 3472.559
blasphemy indeed you're constantly lying

3470.4 --> 3475.799
yeah lying is

3472.559 --> 3475.799
a sin

3479.28 --> 3482.4
yeah

3480.079 --> 3484.88

3482.4 --> 3487.839
any sin can be discovered

3484.88 --> 3489.6800000000003
uncovered uncovered you see it you face

3487.839 --> 3491.68
god you know

3489.68 --> 3493.9199999999996
this is a sin

3491.68 --> 3496.0789999999997
now if you then don't repent then you

3493.92 --> 3498.48
are a sinner because anybody can sin

3496.079 --> 3500.6400000000003
once when they discover it it's like oh

3498.48 --> 3504.16
[ __ ] you correct it

3500.64 --> 3506.0
you apologize to god

3504.16 --> 3508.5589999999997
first

3506.0 --> 3509.839
and then maybe any socially involved

3508.559 --> 3512.2400000000002
person

3509.839 --> 3513.839
in that situation

3512.24 --> 3516.5589999999997
yeah and then you

3513.839 --> 3518.96
overcome the sin god is very forgiving

3516.559 --> 3521.3590000000004
but if you keep lying and lying and

3518.96 --> 3522.88
lying and lying continually and you lie

3521.359 --> 3525.2

that's a sin

3531.04 --> 3534.96
and i don't know how islam deals with

3533.44 --> 3537.2000000000003
that i don't think they're going to

3534.96 --> 3539.04
behead you for that or anything but it's

3537.2 --> 3540.72
very likely that they'll just kick you

3539.04 --> 3542.72
out of their village and say you're not

allowed in here anymore why'd you go

sikh temple before i would like to

3777.039 --> 3781.76
quran does not prescribe punishment for

3779.039 --> 3783.599
blasphemy

3781.76 --> 3786.48
i know

3783.599 --> 3790.0
that's why i never even said that

3786.48 --> 3792.4
the [ __ ] ad phrase [ __ ] was trying

3790.0 --> 3794.799
to pull me there he was trying to make

3792.4 --> 3797.839
me say something like that

3794.799 --> 3797.839
i know

3800.72 --> 3802.9599999999996
right

3805.44 --> 3809.76
but they still don't have any scored

3807.68 --> 3814.0789999999997
boys over there why

3809.76 --> 3814.079
because other things like porn

3814.16 --> 3817.5989999999997
and

3815.28 --> 3822.2400000000002
lust in general

3817.599 --> 3826.079
is absolutely against the law there thus

3822.24 --> 3828.4799999999996
people stop being gammas

3826.079 --> 3830.319
like at face there

3830.319 --> 3834.64
they're not like that anymore

3833.28 --> 3836.8390000000004
yeah

3834.64 --> 3841.1189999999997
he doesn't understand

3836.839 --> 3841.119
anything about what he's talking about

3849.68 --> 3853.839
is drawing mohammed blasphemy

3856.799 --> 3861.2
i don't know i don't even know if it is

3858.799 --> 3861.2
really

3861.52 --> 3865.4
i mean

3862.4 --> 3865.4
like

3866.079 --> 3870.6400000000003
yep that then

3867.76 --> 3875.1600000000003
i guess to the priesthood

3870.64 --> 3875.16
it is considered a blasphemy

3882.64 --> 3887.52
right but yeah this is a good point

3885.52 --> 3889.52
quran doesn't prescribe punishment for

3887.52 --> 3891.7599999999998
blasphemy but there it is happening

3889.52 --> 3891.7599999999998
though

3892.24 --> 3898.64
susie yes so how do you explain that

3895.599 --> 3903.119
are you simply claiming that

3898.64 --> 3903.1189999999997
the quran is really not being

3903.92 --> 3906.7200000000003

3905.359 --> 3908.4
properly

3906.72 --> 3910.0789999999997
by the current

3908.4 --> 3911.2000000000003
islam religion is that what you're

3910.079 --> 3912.48
saying

3911.2 --> 3913.5989999999997
because that would be kind of

3912.48 --> 3914.72
interesting

3913.599 --> 3917.3590000000004
really

3914.72 --> 3918.48
to think about

3917.359 --> 3921.0389999999998
that

3918.48 --> 3923.28
they might have gone astray

3921.039 --> 3925.76
right we know the catholic church has

3923.28 --> 3927.599
gone astray all the way

3925.76 --> 3929.8390000000004
since a long time ago

3927.599 --> 3929.839
so

3930.079 --> 3932.6400000000003
interesting

3933.2 --> 3938.16
but yeah we all remember the whole

3935.52 --> 3940.72
drawing muhammad in the cartoon and the

3938.16 --> 3943.359
guy who was killed for that and all that

3940.72 --> 3945.68
so is that actually something that the

3943.359 --> 3947.92
quran would approve or did they all at

3945.68 --> 3949.7599999999998
home say like uh

3947.92 --> 3952.559
yeah that's actually completely wrong

3949.76 --> 3954.079
this is bad for our religion

3952.559 --> 3956.559
i don't even know

3954.079 --> 3958.559
i don't know

3956.559 --> 3960.4
i mean we only got to see this sort of

3958.559 --> 3963.599
[ __ ] through the media and they only

3960.4 --> 3966.64
show ugly [ __ ] every time the every time

3963.599 --> 3967.76
they go to the grabblers

3966.64 --> 3971.0789999999997
right

3967.76 --> 3971.079
every time

3986.72 --> 3990.839
the creator is the subtitle of

3989.359 --> 3994.799
almost seeking

3990.839 --> 3994.799
yeah but the thing is

3996.079 --> 4001.52
the creator is not literally all things

3998.799 --> 4001.52
it's just that

4001.599 --> 4007.2000000000003
he designed it all

4003.28 --> 4009.52
and he's outside and he knows all

4007.2 --> 4012.48
and he sees all

4009.52 --> 4013.28
he is knowledge he is the pinnacle of

4012.48 --> 4017.64
all

4013.28 --> 4017.6400000000003
knowledge that we could ever touch

4020.64 --> 4023.839
derp alert yeah yeah

4029.44 --> 4032.44
definitely

4063.599 --> 4066.599

4102.08 --> 4105.839
i always forget that tea is warm

4129.759 --> 4135.359
this weather it's like this

4132.96 --> 4139.04
you like if your clothes like get wet

4135.359 --> 4139.04
they just won't dry up

4139.52 --> 4142.719
it's that type of weather

4142.96 --> 4146.96
i mean

4144.48 --> 4148.5599999999995
like my bike saddle has a couple of

4146.96 --> 4150.799
cracks in it unfortunately because it's

4148.56 --> 4152.719
getting older very annoying i have to

4150.799 --> 4154.56
get a new one at some point

4152.719 --> 4156.64
but then when it rains it kind of like

4154.56 --> 4159.120000000001
sponges up water and then when i ride it

4156.64 --> 4161.679
like my pants get all wet my freaking

4159.12 --> 4162.96
fans are still wet of me riding that

4161.679 --> 4165.359
bike

4162.96 --> 4169.4
what is it now three hours ago

4165.359 --> 4169.400000000001
i mean what the hell man

change them

4184.56 --> 4187.92
no

4185.52 --> 4191.4400000000005
i let them dry up i mean it's not like

4187.92 --> 4194.08
my entire pants got completely drenched

4191.44 --> 4194.08
or something

4195.44 --> 4198.879999999999
it's not that bad

4197.36 --> 4201.36
right if it would have been that bad i'd

4198.88 --> 4203.28
probably have taken them off and hang

4201.36 --> 4205.759999999999
them out to dry or something but it's

4203.28 --> 4205.759999999999
just that

4208.8 --> 4212.04
i don't know it's just very sticky

4212.04 --> 4215.229
[Music]

4226.56 --> 4231.04

they have dried up actually it's just

4231.04 --> 4239.48
me being sticky and you

4234.719 --> 4239.4800000000005

4287.04 --> 4291.12
and he said it's a human right and i

4288.96 --> 4292.08
said it's a duty to god and then he had

4291.12 --> 4295.36
to

4292.08 --> 4295.36
start whining about

4295.52 --> 4299.4400000000005

godzilla is it that bad

4533.199 --> 4536.639999999999
i mean why are you cartman

4536.719 --> 4542.08
i mean

4538.64 --> 4546.4800000000005
not all hippies are useless you know

4542.08 --> 4547.66
i mean these guys got a freaking winery

4546.48 --> 4550.91
so

4547.66 --> 4550.91
[Music]

4553.92 --> 4559.04
right yeah seek star wars ah you're

4556.08 --> 4559.04
still in the middle of moving

4561.44 --> 4565.4
right exciting times

4568.56 --> 4572.64
you're closer to cartman than john

4576.64 --> 4583.12
thank you for that

4578.96 --> 4585.679
yeah me too i'm not exactly john lennon

4583.12 --> 4585.679
myself

4587.28 --> 4594.08
although i did really like his like

4591.04 --> 4595.44
his brazen like fearless attitude it was

4594.08 --> 4598.32
just like

4595.44 --> 4599.199
no i'm just gonna do this like on high

4598.32 --> 4602.08
level

4599.199 --> 4604.159
that part i really liked about him i'd

4602.08 --> 4608.92
like to think that i have actually

4604.159 --> 4608.92
assimilated that to a certain degree

4610.159 --> 4618.32
but yeah carpet is freaking is a genius

4614.88 --> 4618.32
he's a grappler genius

4620.4 --> 4626.32
i mean cartman has basically invented

4623.52 --> 4628.56
a way of doing things and he's a cartoon

4626.32 --> 4630.96
figure

4628.56 --> 4633.4400000000005
and he's a thing now culturally it's

4630.96 --> 4634.84
that amazing

4633.44 --> 4636.4
terrible but

4634.84 --> 4638.400000000001
amazing

4636.4 --> 4640.799999999999
and at least you always know what he's

4638.4 --> 4640.799999999999
gonna do

4646.08 --> 4649.199
or rather that he is going to do

4648.239 --> 4651.5199999999995
something

4649.199 --> 4653.919999999999
not necessarily what he's gonna do but

4651.52 --> 4657.84
you know it's gonna be annoying

4653.92 --> 4657.84
probably nitpicky whiny

4659.44 --> 4663.08
extremely projecting

4667.6 --> 4670.96
confidence hybridize his own strain of

4670.0 --> 4673.36
folk

4670.96 --> 4673.36
grape

4674.08 --> 4679.4
rich hippie awesome

4676.0 --> 4679.4
good for him

4679.92 --> 4685.36
i hope he's uh staying out of politics

4682.48 --> 4685.36
as much as he can

4685.52 --> 4688.88
he's not like become a

4689.199 --> 4693.5599999999995
liberal hippie i hope

4709.679 --> 4715.4400000000005
all right screw screw you guys and gang

4713.12 --> 4715.44
him

4715.52 --> 4718.52
yeah

4722.8 --> 4728.8
i mean that's a sign of somebody that's

4724.88 --> 4728.8
being driven by their own compass

4732.48 --> 4737.839999999999
that's by the way exactly how his mother

4734.88 --> 4739.92
would describe that

4737.84 --> 4742.08
that cardman's [ __ ] he always says

4739.92 --> 4744.56
screw you guys go home

4742.08 --> 4746.08
oh no dear

4744.56 --> 4748.4800000000005
he's just

4746.08 --> 4752.92
going by his own compass

4748.48 --> 4752.919999999999
he's just a determined little boy

4768.159 --> 4773.04
you get a hippie infestation and the

4769.76 --> 4777.64
drum circles amazing

4773.04 --> 4777.64
it is really one of my favorite episodes

4778.08 --> 4782.719
although i have many

4780.88 --> 4785.52
but that was the golden age that was

4782.719 --> 4787.76
like the peak epic

4785.52 --> 4790.4800000000005
times which by the way was most of south

4787.76 --> 4792.8
park like

4790.48 --> 4794.959999999999
first chunk was messy

4792.8 --> 4798.320000000001
first two seasons then things really hit

4794.96 --> 4800.8
off and it's like the last

4798.32 --> 4803.12
six seasons it's just it's still cool

4800.8 --> 4805.92
but it kind of just mutates and becomes

4803.12 --> 4808.48
more formulaic

4805.92 --> 4811.6
but it was like 10 seasons straight that

4808.48 --> 4811.599999999999
was just amazing

4811.76 --> 4816.639
and it still has some of its old traits

4814.56 --> 4819.52
right but if just they've done a certain

4816.639 --> 4821.28
weird formula formula thing now

4819.52 --> 4823.84
it's just

4821.28 --> 4823.84
it's different

4824.719 --> 4829.36
it's not the

4826.639 --> 4832.159000000001
like the chaos

4829.36 --> 4836.0
just the raw raw chaos that it used to

4832.159 --> 4838.4
be now more story driven more adapted to

4836.0 --> 4840.96
sjw nonsense really

4838.4 --> 4840.96
annoying

4841.6 --> 4846.120000000001
george clooney smug what

4853.84 --> 4857.76
this

4855.199 --> 4861.799999999999
i do that all the time is that a george

4857.76 --> 4861.8
clooney thing what

4865.12 --> 4869.4
i was thought it was a spark thing

4883.44 --> 4888.919999999999
oh

4884.56 --> 4888.92
okay the studio 68

4895.44 --> 4900.36
yeah trench what the hell are you

4897.04 --> 4900.36
talking about

4905.76 --> 4909.320000000001
we mean transhumanism

4928.239 --> 4931.239
anyway

4938.06 --> 4941.459000000001
[Music]

4941.52 --> 4946.56
i got 10 more minutes i could just sit

4944.56 --> 4950.0
here and

4946.56 --> 4950.96
not a lot or run out early or you guys

4950.0 --> 4952.56
could

4950.96 --> 4954.8
give me something to talk about for

4952.56 --> 4956.96
another 10 minutes

4954.8 --> 4958.719
up to you

4956.96 --> 4960.719
mixing humans and computer yeah it's

4958.719 --> 4961.92
always been a science fiction ridiculous

4960.719 --> 4964.639
fantasy

4961.92 --> 4964.639
the studio

4964.88 --> 4968.08
yeah

4966.08 --> 4970.5599999999995
it doesn't work

4968.08 --> 4975.04
biology rejects

4970.56 --> 4975.04
it because it's not compatible

4981.92 --> 4987.28
right unless you're going to go into

4983.52 --> 4990.280000000001
like freaky bio bio-engineering-based

4987.28 --> 4990.28
biocomputers

4990.88 --> 4995.6
but that's still separate i mean an

4992.96 --> 4998.159
organism that would be made to be able

4995.6 --> 5000.400000000001
to compute like a computer

4998.159 --> 5004.719
how is that going to integrate with an

5000.4 --> 5007.28
actual god designed system

5004.719 --> 5008.32
i don't think that can work

5007.28 --> 5012.08
right

5008.32 --> 5013.679
i mean i am all for bio computers

5012.08 --> 5017.6
really

5013.679 --> 5019.52
not like humans that are then like

5017.6 --> 5022.4800000000005
turn off their consciousness and then

5019.52 --> 5024.320000000001
they become like a computer that's just

5022.48 --> 5025.28
being used by the outside world not like

5024.32 --> 5026.88
that

5025.28 --> 5030.32
but to just

5026.88 --> 5034.0
try to engineer

5030.32 --> 5034.799999999999
biology like a brain or something

5034.0 --> 5036.719
and

5034.8 --> 5039.04
make it into an active computer

5036.719 --> 5041.76
component why not

5039.04 --> 5046.56
i mean it'll literally save

5041.76 --> 5046.56
on material resources if you do that

5051.12 --> 5056.199
pacemakers for heart seems to work

5052.88 --> 5056.1990000000005
pretty good

5066.08 --> 5069.199
yeah

5066.96 --> 5069.199
but

5069.52 --> 5073.92
i mean

5070.88 --> 5076.0
not perfectly i mean without

5073.92 --> 5077.6
if you just got the pacemaker and that's

5076.0 --> 5078.719
it

5077.6 --> 5080.4800000000005
there's all kinds of things that

5078.719 --> 5082.96
typically go wrong

5080.48 --> 5084.718999999999
right has to be calibrated loud these

5082.96 --> 5087.12
things can go wrong electric

5084.719 --> 5088.8
interference i mean that's not the end

5087.12 --> 5090.639
of it

5088.8 --> 5093.52
besides it's not a

5090.639 --> 5093.52
is it like a

5094.639 --> 5099.36
it's a very specific thing that's being

5096.48 --> 5101.199
driven by a pacemaker

5099.36 --> 5103.04
it's not like a brain interface or

5101.199 --> 5108.44
something right which is really what

5103.04 --> 5111.72
transhumanism is typically focusing on

5108.44 --> 5111.719999999999
[Music]

5118.639 --> 5122.32
our brain cells on chips all right

5122.56 --> 5127.4400000000005
well pg cnet i i don't see it i don't

5125.679 --> 5129.89
yeah it's gross

5127.44 --> 5133.079
i don't see the problem though

5129.89 --> 5133.079000000001
[Music]

5136.96 --> 5139.36
if they're gonna

5138.159 --> 5142.48
engineer

5139.36 --> 5144.88
biology specifically to do that and make

5142.48 --> 5148.718999999999
it into an industrial application

5144.88 --> 5151.12
then technically i don't see the problem

5148.719 --> 5154.2390000000005
now if they just start like using

5151.12 --> 5157.92
aborted fetuses for that sort of thing

5154.239 --> 5157.919999999999
yeah then that would be a problem

5166.8 --> 5172.159000000001
right but if they bioengineer it

5169.6 --> 5173.92
kind of from scratch

5172.159 --> 5175.759999999999
then

5173.92 --> 5178.4800000000005
yeah it is

5175.76 --> 5180.2390000000005
it is effectively entering transhumanist

5178.48 --> 5181.28
type of era

5180.239 --> 5183.839999999999
but

5181.28 --> 5183.84
i

5185.679 --> 5189.28
i mean the only thing that you could

5187.28 --> 5191.44
really utter as like an objection is

5189.28 --> 5193.28
like yeah if we let them go this far

5191.44 --> 5195.199
then they could go even further that's

5193.28 --> 5197.36
the only objection that i could

5195.199 --> 5199.04
technically think of

5197.36 --> 5201.679
because there's no direct moral

5199.04 --> 5201.679
objection

5203.12 --> 5207.44
i mean

5204.719 --> 5208.88
if you can use animals to pull your

5207.44 --> 5210.879999999999
wagons

5208.88 --> 5212.159000000001
for farming right

5210.88 --> 5214.56
pull your

5212.159 --> 5217.679
your plows or something

5214.56 --> 5219.120000000001
then why couldn't you use bioengineered

5217.679 --> 5221.76
cells

5219.12 --> 5223.679
for microchips

5221.76 --> 5228.04
why why not

5223.679 --> 5228.04
how is it really that different

5251.28 --> 5255.759999999999
all right but on on the other hand you

5253.199 --> 5258.4
know i'm not like a oh super proponent

5255.76 --> 5261.12
for biotech either

5258.4 --> 5264.48
i'm not a i'm just saying i don't think

5261.12 --> 5266.4
it's the ultimate evil no no it's what

5264.48 --> 5268.959999999999
we do

5266.4 --> 5271.44
that would be that

5268.96 --> 5272.56
you could do really [ __ ] up things

5271.44 --> 5274.5599999999995
with it

5272.56 --> 5277.360000000001
potentially and that would be

5274.56 --> 5278.96
yeah not a good thing

5277.36 --> 5282.159
there's other directions you could take

5278.96 --> 5285.199
the development too as i already said

5282.159 --> 5287.92
was the flat earth debates uh

5285.199 --> 5290.159
three days ago i think

5287.92 --> 5292.0
that yeah what if

5290.159 --> 5294.239
you could literally make

5292.0 --> 5297.6
light based microchips instead of

5294.239 --> 5298.959999999999
electric or instead of even like bio

5297.6 --> 5300.159000000001
matter

5298.96 --> 5305.76
light based

5300.159 --> 5307.92
like micro micro nan beyond nano crystal

5305.76 --> 5309.84
type systems you would effectively have

5307.92 --> 5312.0
a giant chip

5309.84 --> 5314.08
it's not giant it's actually microscopic

5312.0 --> 5314.8
but it would be like a grid

5314.08 --> 5318.159
of

5314.8 --> 5319.76
like perfect perfectly

5318.159 --> 5322.239
crystallized

5319.76 --> 5324.96
systems that would just with with sub

5322.239 --> 5327.12
light would be able to just

5324.96 --> 5329.199
would in everything would be instant

5327.12 --> 5331.12
instant instant instant light all

5329.199 --> 5335.5599999999995
instant

5331.12 --> 5335.5599999999995
just everything instant did

5336.159 --> 5342.48
so instead of electric micro electronics

5339.92 --> 5344.56
it would be micro photonics i guess

5342.48 --> 5346.4
because yeah it's not no longer electric

5344.56 --> 5350.04
so it's not micro electronics it would

5346.4 --> 5350.04
be micro photonics

5350.159 --> 5355.36
that might also be a possibility for

5352.48 --> 5358.32
technological future development

5355.36 --> 5359.679
instead of biotechnology

5358.32 --> 5362.799999999999
how about

5359.679 --> 5365.84
bio instead of bioelectrics

5362.8 --> 5365.84
we could go for

5367.52 --> 5372.88
micro photonics

5370.88 --> 5373.92
and this all sounds extremely science

5372.88 --> 5378.1990000000005
fiction

5373.92 --> 5378.1990000000005
it could be extremely real

5393.12 --> 5397.44
right yeah that's the thing too steamy

5395.04 --> 5400.32
traveler this idea of a freaking implant

5397.44 --> 5401.44
is so annoying

5400.32 --> 5403.92
like

5401.44 --> 5406.0
oh we need a brain interface well you

5403.92 --> 5407.76
already even got like google glasses

5406.0 --> 5409.92
thing it already proves it's not

5407.76 --> 5411.84
necessary not that google glasses is a

5409.92 --> 5414.719
good thing

5411.84 --> 5417.1990000000005
but it showed that yeah

5414.719 --> 5418.88
you don't need an implant to have like a

5417.199 --> 5421.36
brain interface

5418.88 --> 5424.2390000000005
it effectively means that it's not

5421.36 --> 5426.239
inconceivable that at some point

5424.239 --> 5428.32
technologically you could develop a

5426.239 --> 5431.678999999999
crown you would just have a crown you

5428.32 --> 5431.679
put it on your head and it's

5431.92 --> 5438.0
like what do you mean jack inc

5434.56 --> 5439.1990000000005
like the matrix no you just brown

5438.0 --> 5440.8
boom

5439.199 --> 5445.28
you're there

5440.8 --> 5448.96
that's simple just a crown put it on

5445.28 --> 5450.48
i mean that's probably gonna happen guys

5448.96 --> 5452.719
i mean who the hell needs virtual

5450.48 --> 5454.718999999999
reality it's in google

5452.719 --> 5456.08
with some freaking glasses goggles

5454.719 --> 5458.159
whatever

5456.08 --> 5460.5599999999995
when you could just have like

5458.159 --> 5463.759999999999
bling and just

5460.56 --> 5465.679
complete overlay

5463.76 --> 5467.52
of your normal experience it's like a

5465.679 --> 5469.679
sub world i mean that would be a

5467.52 --> 5472.4800000000005
metaverse a virtual reality metaphors it

5469.679 --> 5474.88
would be computer driven

5472.48 --> 5477.44
and yeah you don't have to put anything

5474.88 --> 5480.32
over your eyes

5477.44 --> 5482.159
you just put on a circlip cling and

5480.32 --> 5484.639
you're in there you might have to

5482.159 --> 5486.159
calibrate first especially the first

5484.639 --> 5488.639
time

5486.159 --> 5490.32
to get in there it might have some weird

5488.639 --> 5493.04
side effects you might experience

5490.32 --> 5493.84
aberrations because everybody's brain is

5493.04 --> 5495.6
is

5493.84 --> 5497.679
different

5495.6 --> 5500.56
to always have that issue

5497.679 --> 5504.52
but like who the hell needs implants

5500.56 --> 5504.52
it's totally unnecessary

5507.04 --> 5512.159
right so yeah on that science fiction

5509.76 --> 5514.159000000001
talk i'm gonna round out now

5512.159 --> 5516.0
thanks everyone for coming i hope you

5542.719 --> 5548.0
here's the link to that awesome short

5546.0 --> 5550.32
that nathan and me did yesterday on the

5548.0 --> 5552.32
flat earth debate live made into a short

5550.32 --> 5554.0
check it out if you haven't already it's

5552.32 --> 5555.599999999999
amazing it's also what the title of my

5554.0 --> 5558.32
show is about

5555.6 --> 5560.8
from today right so anyway

5558.32 --> 5563.679
i'll be back tomorrow with flat earth

5560.8 --> 5565.4400000000005
early bird number 1338

5563.679 --> 5567.04
on a friday and i'm going to join the

5565.44 --> 5569.599999999999
flat earth debates

5567.04 --> 5572.239
over at nathan oakley 1980 channel it

5569.6 --> 5576.740000000001
should start up any second now

5572.239 --> 5608.039
till the next video keep it flat

5576.74 --> 5608.039
[Music]

5625.04 --> 5627.12
you
