344.8 --> 350.6
it's kind of tough to tell i

346.639 --> 350.6

352.78 --> 355.9
[Music]

358.96 --> 361.96
uh

367.84 --> 374.88
right yeah it doesn't say right here

370.96 --> 374.88
what the what the wind direction is

375.84 --> 380.59999999999997
i have to

376.96 --> 380.59999999999997
dig a little deeper

383.12 --> 385.36
right

385.759 --> 392.28000000000003

440.24 --> 444.639
quite a distance away

442.88 --> 449.24
so unless you're

444.639 --> 449.24
willing to travel all the way over here

450.08 --> 454.039
i'm not going anywhere

464.479 --> 467.84
right

465.84 --> 471.84
i mean the netherlands is small but it's

467.84 --> 471.84
not not like one town

472.56 --> 477.199
still quite a few distance between

475.12 --> 478.879
the places

477.199 --> 481.599
and i don't have a car or anything and

478.879 --> 484.639
even then it would be like

481.599 --> 487.639
several hours travel

484.639 --> 487.639
anyway

492.479 --> 496.639
oh okay he will all right

497.199 --> 500.0
well if you want to

500.319 --> 506.199
keep contact then just

502.56 --> 506.199
add me on skype

507.12 --> 512.24
and let me know

509.12 --> 512.24
when you're in the neighborhood

512.56 --> 515.7189999999999
all right

533.6 --> 538.6800000000001
where are you from gadfly if i may ask

555.2 --> 559.0
you okay all right

565.519 --> 567.76
ah

571.44 --> 575.9590000000001
anyway

572.959 --> 575.959
huh

577.68 --> 582.2399999999999
yeah

579.68 --> 584.7199999999999
i started the show on time for once how

582.24 --> 586.0
about that or sort of very close to one

584.72 --> 587.36
time

586.0 --> 591.839
uh

587.36 --> 591.839
what's popular i don't know

591.92 --> 596.0799999999999
yeah but i don't want to go to a

593.519 --> 596.08
restaurant

597.44 --> 601.24
like

598.24 --> 601.24
yeah

604.88 --> 610.64
i mean if somebody wants to buy me

607.12 --> 614.079
dinner then that kind of means that

610.64 --> 617.68
i get the money to well

614.079 --> 621.8389999999999
buy the ingredients to make dinner

617.68 --> 624.8
because i don't really go out for dinner

621.839 --> 627.519
i haven't done that in a long time

624.8 --> 628.959
because there's barely any organic

627.519 --> 630.64
restaurants

628.959 --> 634.56
around and

630.64 --> 635.68
yeah they're kind of expensive

634.56 --> 639.3199999999999
anyway

635.68 --> 639.3199999999999
hello john 11.

653.83 --> 656.899
[Music]

665.44 --> 669.2790000000001
yeah but anyway i went to bed pretty

667.44 --> 672.9590000000001
early

669.279 --> 672.959
this time actually pretty early

673.68 --> 675.8389999999999
what

680.48 --> 685.12
trying to enlighten a skeptical dutch

682.88 --> 686.8389999999999
colleague

685.12 --> 690.24
good luck with

686.839 --> 693.519
that are stubborn as [ __ ]

690.24 --> 693.519
especially the ballers

701.76 --> 707.76
i mean yeah

704.56 --> 710.16
if it is basically your understanding in

707.76 --> 712.079
the explanation that is lacking that is

710.16 --> 713.4399999999999
the problem and he's holding on to that

712.079 --> 715.8389999999999
i could help

713.44 --> 719.2
but if he's just like

715.839 --> 719.2
yeah i can't help with that

719.92 --> 723.92
it's just doesn't matter if i'm gonna be

722.24 --> 726.0790000000001
there

723.92 --> 727.68
i mean

726.079 --> 729.519
he's open-minded

727.68 --> 730.959
okay

729.519 --> 732.9590000000001
right

730.959 --> 735.3599999999999
well look we can talk about that on

732.959 --> 735.3599999999999
skype

736.959 --> 742.88
right don't have to

738.88 --> 744.56
spend my show now doing all that

742.88 --> 746.72
unless you want to like

744.56 --> 749.5189999999999
drop some details or something and i can

746.72 --> 749.519
respond to that

752.32 --> 756.24
anyway i had a pretty good night's sleep

754.959 --> 759.8389999999999
but

756.24 --> 759.839
i did have some like really

760.079 --> 763.04
creepy ass

761.76 --> 765.6
nightmares

763.04 --> 768.639
basically overcoming me but that was

765.6 --> 770.88
when i was still awake

768.639 --> 772.639
almost makes subscribe address is in the

770.88 --> 775.04
description box

772.639 --> 778.48
it's the first sentence in this youtube

775.04 --> 778.48
description box gadfly

778.959 --> 786.4399999999999
it's my email address

782.16 --> 786.4399999999999
same email address for my paypal

787.2 --> 791.48
it's hard to

788.48 --> 791.48
overlook

807.6 --> 812.72
anyway yeah i had some rough

810.72 --> 816.8000000000001
things basically

812.72 --> 820.0
you could say dark world flashbacks

816.8 --> 820.0
because that is what they are

821.04 --> 824.56
and i'm still kind of like

824.8 --> 828.519
shaken by it

837.6 --> 842.16
it's certainly been helping to connect

840.079 --> 844.399
things up as to what's going on right

842.16 --> 844.399
now

848.16 --> 853.6
it just really makes me nervous and

852.24 --> 857.839
i

853.6 --> 860.399
i can't actually do anything with it

857.839 --> 865.24
it just kind of overcomes me

860.399 --> 865.24
every time i'm reminded about that

879.36 --> 883.6
right but i'm

880.639 --> 884.72
i'm taking it decently i had kind of

883.6 --> 885.519
hoped to

884.72 --> 887.839
like

885.519 --> 890.079
have contact with my healer he usually

887.839 --> 892.399
like helps really well

890.079 --> 895.279
but yeah he didn't pick up the phone

892.399 --> 898.76
it is sunday so i don't know

895.279 --> 898.76
i'll be all right

899.519 --> 906.8
but i affect my i had a pretty good rest

903.44 --> 906.8000000000001
bodily wise at least

908.959 --> 914.959
also most of like the inflammation

911.519 --> 917.04
issues i kind of had coinciding

914.959 --> 919.199
with sort of having a cold

917.04 --> 920.16
i think because of the coffee is also

919.199 --> 922.8
like

920.16 --> 927.16
receding so i'm getting more stable

922.8 --> 927.16
again but yeah that

929.279 --> 935.8389999999999
those sort of like

931.839 --> 939.8800000000001
ptsd flashbacks

935.839 --> 939.8800000000001
are extremely unpleasant

946.48 --> 948.8000000000001
right

950.0 --> 955.32
i can't i can't talk about that

956.32 --> 961.36
yeah i'm laughing about it but it's out

958.56 --> 961.3599999999999
of embarrassment

967.44 --> 971.12
i mean

968.48 --> 973.6800000000001
one-on-one if i kind of trust somebody

971.12 --> 976.72
which is very hard to attain that to

973.68 --> 976.7199999999999
that level i might

979.279 --> 984.079
confidentially

981.68 --> 986.2399999999999
roll it out

984.079 --> 990.0
but that would be face to face and no

986.24 --> 990.0
electrical devices near

992.8 --> 997.8
it's

994.399 --> 997.8
dark stuff

1004.959 --> 1009.199
right but i'm trying to recover and just

1007.44 --> 1010.8000000000001
get back to what i'm supposed to be

1009.199 --> 1011.68
doing here

1010.8 --> 1014.4799999999999
with

1011.68 --> 1016.3199999999999
yeah the time that it was

1014.48 --> 1019.04
designated to me

1016.32 --> 1019.0400000000001
here on earth

1020.16 --> 1025.28
and the main task really has been for a

1022.959 --> 1028.24
long time

1025.28 --> 1030.24
to basically not let well

1028.24 --> 1033.1200000000001
the ptsd

1030.24 --> 1036.24
get to me and ruin

1033.12 --> 1038.319
what it was basically planted there for

1036.24 --> 1039.199
to ruin

1038.319 --> 1041.9189999999999
by

1039.199 --> 1044.48
those other people that were apparently

1041.919 --> 1046.24
able to look into the future somehow

1044.48 --> 1051.079
through me

1046.24 --> 1051.079
in the past and they did that

1053.84 --> 1058.72
because i think they thought i was very

1057.679 --> 1061.2
like

1058.72 --> 1063.2
blunt and with a lot of bravado

1061.2 --> 1065.8400000000001
confident

1063.2 --> 1068.24
and like

1065.84 --> 1070.48
there were people like really seriously

1068.24 --> 1071.76
threatened by that in my past and i had

1070.48 --> 1073.44
no idea

1071.76 --> 1075.919
i thought i would i didn't even

1073.44 --> 1079.28
understand that they were there and that

1075.919 --> 1079.2800000000002
was the original problem

1079.6 --> 1084.0
i i didn't believe evil was

1082.4 --> 1085.3600000000001
really

1084.0 --> 1088.559
that bad

1085.36 --> 1091.1999999999998
and that was like a huge wisdom mistake

1088.559 --> 1095.039
on my part when i was basically

1091.2 --> 1097.52
gathering all my energy and trying to

1095.039 --> 1101.12
like sort of become a leader

1097.52 --> 1103.12
and it was much younger right

1101.12 --> 1106.3999999999999
but it didn't work

1103.12 --> 1109.6
because i i did not understand

1106.4 --> 1110.72
that evil was really bad and out there

1109.6 --> 1114.48
and

1110.72 --> 1115.919
terrifyingly in ways in ways not at all

1114.48 --> 1118.16
in always

1115.919 --> 1118.96
in control

1118.16 --> 1120.16
and

1118.96 --> 1121.8400000000001
yeah

1120.16 --> 1123.6000000000001
if you literally

1121.84 --> 1125.76
ignore that i guess

1123.6 --> 1127.9189999999999
whether it was even hinted to me if it

1125.76 --> 1129.919
had been i had literally been ignoring

1127.919 --> 1133.919
it because i couldn't handle that but if

1129.919 --> 1136.64
you then build your entire energy plan

1133.919 --> 1137.679
and vision onto the future overlooking

1136.64 --> 1140.5590000000002
that

1137.679 --> 1142.96
then you're building a false system and

1140.559 --> 1144.559
that's what happened to me

1142.96 --> 1147.3600000000001
so what happened to me

1144.559 --> 1151.84
basically my big go

1147.36 --> 1151.84
moment i was completely destroyed

1152.48 --> 1157.84
because i had completely

1154.4 --> 1157.8400000000001
sized up everything wrong

1160.48 --> 1165.679
about how the world really worked

1164.24 --> 1169.1200000000001
talking about

1165.679 --> 1172.72
like 25 years ago

1169.12 --> 1172.7199999999998
up to 20 years ago

1173.44 --> 1176.24
and yeah

1176.64 --> 1180.16
how i was haunts me

1180.799 --> 1185.679
but also just what i actually learned

1183.679 --> 1189.5590000000002
that i couldn't handle haunts me

1185.679 --> 1189.5590000000002
probably even more

1192.799 --> 1196.559
right so i had a bit of a dark night

1197.44 --> 1200.24
without a k

1203.12 --> 1207.1999999999998
right but the rest of the day was pretty

1204.799 --> 1208.96
good though

1207.2 --> 1211.28
and i think i really mastered the

1208.96 --> 1213.2
off-world trading company game

1211.28 --> 1214.96
which i'm

1213.2 --> 1217.3600000000001
kind of surprised i thought that it

1214.96 --> 1220.52
would just like ah start to really hate

1217.36 --> 1220.52
it and

1220.88 --> 1228.3200000000002
stop playing it but it actually

1223.84 --> 1231.72
there is apparently room for learning

1228.32 --> 1231.72
for me there

1234.0 --> 1238.159
and so who knows what that will bring

1236.32 --> 1241.28
for the future

1238.159 --> 1242.4
also some unexpected turns on the gti

1241.28 --> 1243.2
front

1242.4 --> 1244.96
my

1243.2 --> 1248.88
kind of

1244.96 --> 1252.24
halted money future project from five

1248.88 --> 1252.24
years six years ago now

1252.4 --> 1258.4
so

1253.28 --> 1260.8799999999999
like it might revive somehow

1258.4 --> 1262.72
but you never really know it's like i

1260.88 --> 1264.159
basically i'm not gonna trust that but

1262.72 --> 1265.84
there's like some unexpected

1264.159 --> 1268.159
developments

1265.84 --> 1270.48
again so it's always like

1268.159 --> 1273.679
it's got something gonna happen some so

1270.48 --> 1277.84
who knows i don't know

1273.679 --> 1277.8400000000001
i don't know what's going on what

1284.64 --> 1290.5200000000002
yeah at least you yeah

1286.4 --> 1290.52
i know we had a skype chat

1295.039 --> 1298.72
but i was also kind of busy

1299.44 --> 1304.679
and i didn't want to go to bed too late

1301.679 --> 1304.679
so

1339.2 --> 1345.88
hello jose welcome back

1342.159 --> 1345.88
and banned you

1355.28 --> 1358.3999999999999
i banned you really because you were

1356.64 --> 1361.8400000000001
just getting on my nerve yesterday it

1358.4 --> 1361.8400000000001
was very annoying

1362.32 --> 1368.32
but yeah did you weren't like

1365.679 --> 1372.6000000000001
overstepping like any serious boundaries

1368.32 --> 1372.6
it was just getting on my nerve

1377.36 --> 1381.6789999999999
like don't bring your

1379.44 --> 1381.679
uh

1382.24 --> 1387.24
your giant skepticism to me thanks

1391.679 --> 1394.919
a clutch

1407.679 --> 1412.2800000000002
oh dear oh dear right there

1425.039 --> 1431.72
what's the topic today

1428.0 --> 1431.72
not really a topic

1440.64 --> 1444.8400000000001
i've been watching owen benjamin

1445.2 --> 1450.559
went through wizard war 3 completely it

1447.52 --> 1453.039
was very intense

1450.559 --> 1455.36
very interesting

1453.039 --> 1458.0
also got halfway like

1455.36 --> 1461.4399999999998
show from friday

1458.0 --> 1461.44
there's blood in the streets

1462.0 --> 1466.24
a little less intense but still

1463.679 --> 1466.24
interesting

1466.32 --> 1470.96
uh

1468.48 --> 1470.96
let's see

1471.44 --> 1474.72
there was no flatter day night i meant

1473.039 --> 1477.2
it yeah it's because

1474.72 --> 1480.679
martin luther is like on his

1477.2 --> 1480.679
tour thing

1486.4 --> 1490.799
i hung around over at dells beyond the

1489.279 --> 1493.12
imaginary curve

1490.799 --> 1496.1589999999999
a bit that was interesting

1493.12 --> 1496.1589999999999
it was very clear

1496.96 --> 1501.8400000000001
like

1498.08 --> 1504.559
you never really know what to expect but

1501.84 --> 1506.799
sometimes his shows are really

1504.559 --> 1508.6399999999999
interesting and funny he had he had a

1506.799 --> 1511.52
couple of troll callers they were like

1508.64 --> 1513.3600000000001
really anti-flat earther wretches

1511.52 --> 1515.12
and he went off on them and that was

1513.36 --> 1516.3999999999999
like yeah

1515.12 --> 1519.1999999999998
that was

1516.4 --> 1519.2
well deserved

1523.12 --> 1525.6789999999999
let's see

1526.64 --> 1530.5590000000002
jim bob is also kind of doing it

1531.039 --> 1536.64
recently he's like moved in doors and

1533.679 --> 1539.44
now he's like having other guests

1536.64 --> 1543.24
basically live talking on a show

1539.44 --> 1543.24
people that call in

1545.039 --> 1549.44
and yeah that's new

1547.2 --> 1553.159
you kinda have to get used to it

1549.44 --> 1553.159
it is very different

1569.6 --> 1573.9189999999999
there is an angry he's not an idiot

1578.159 --> 1583.7600000000002
he's impulsive he's he has like a bit of

1581.84 --> 1586.9599999999998
spark of rage in him too

1583.76 --> 1586.96
but he's not an idiot

1588.64 --> 1595.279
he's actually very sharp

1590.72 --> 1595.279
he just like gets carried away a bit

1595.44 --> 1600.0
and then distracted by that that that is

1597.76 --> 1602.32
all exactly he's very when he's very

1600.0 --> 1605.679
clear and he is at times

1602.32 --> 1605.6789999999999
he is very sharp

1606.4 --> 1613.1200000000001
sharp on a psychological level

1608.88 --> 1616.64
and i find that very interesting

1613.12 --> 1619.039
like dell has developed a lot of skill

1616.64 --> 1621.76
in all the years like when he started

1619.039 --> 1625.12
out yeah he kind of was just kind of an

1621.76 --> 1626.559
angry idiot he kind of really was

1625.12 --> 1630.2399999999998
but

1626.559 --> 1630.24
like there's more focus now

1633.36 --> 1637.52
he actually

1634.799 --> 1640.0
figures out and describes it a lot

1637.52 --> 1642.24
better than he did like five years ago a

1640.0 --> 1645.72
lot better

1642.24 --> 1645.72
so it's interesting

1655.919 --> 1659.919
back up to date with owen lost him a few

1657.84 --> 1663.9189999999999
months

1659.919 --> 1667.44
yeah yeah well it is he dude like

1663.919 --> 1670.159
he has like big streams like every day

1667.44 --> 1672.799
like for me it's like too much sometimes

1670.159 --> 1672.7990000000002
even for me

1674.48 --> 1680.08
like it's so much he even says it

1677.6 --> 1680.8799999999999
was it on the wizard wizard war stream

1680.08 --> 1683.9189999999999
or

1680.88 --> 1685.6000000000001
yet or a friday stream

1683.919 --> 1687.1200000000001
even said it

1685.6 --> 1689.1999999999998
like yeah

1687.12 --> 1690.9599999999998
you'd almost be crazy to watch like

1689.2 --> 1694.44
everything every time because it takes

1690.96 --> 1694.44
so much time

1700.72 --> 1706.24
the outrageous when he meets something

1703.12 --> 1706.2399999999998
he doesn't understand

1706.88 --> 1711.6000000000001
no

1708.24 --> 1712.88
no that's not how that works at all

1711.6 --> 1715.039
i mean

1712.88 --> 1717.5200000000002
he doesn't really

1715.039 --> 1719.44
misunderstand or not understand a lot of

1717.52 --> 1722.48
things anymore he does actually pay

1719.44 --> 1725.039
attention even though he

1722.48 --> 1726.48
doesn't always

1725.039 --> 1730.399
prove that

1726.48 --> 1730.3990000000001
by just laying it out every time

1731.76 --> 1736.72
like he's not a nerdy type like that

1735.679 --> 1739.2
like me

1736.72 --> 1741.039
i'm much more of a nerdy type i actually

1739.2 --> 1743.279
just like proving my knowledge all the

1741.039 --> 1744.399
time and laying it out explaining and i

1743.279 --> 1747.2
use that

1744.399 --> 1750.2399999999998
he doesn't really do that

1747.2 --> 1752.559
i mean in the past yeah he could like

1750.24 --> 1754.3990000000001
put up like a bit of a cocky outrage

1752.559 --> 1757.2
moment to kind of cover for that he

1754.399 --> 1758.9599999999998
doesn't really have a grip on something

1757.2 --> 1760.48
that he still wants to have an opinion

1758.96 --> 1762.88
about

1760.48 --> 1765.96
but these days he doesn't really do that

1762.88 --> 1765.96
a lot

1766.0 --> 1772.08
doesn't need to because he does actually

1768.32 --> 1772.08
understand things a lot better

1778.24 --> 1781.72
so yeah

1785.84 --> 1791.279
but i guess just like myself

1789.039 --> 1794.8799999999999
it can be very triggering

1791.279 --> 1797.12
to the philosophical opponent right

1794.88 --> 1799.919
because he just really gets to you

1797.12 --> 1801.6
sometimes doesn't he

1799.919 --> 1804.0800000000002
and then you just want to call him

1801.6 --> 1804.08
stupid

1804.24 --> 1809.84
i know

1805.84 --> 1809.84
i know i invoked the same effect

1825.2 --> 1828.2
so

1839.36 --> 1842.84
anything else

1877.76 --> 1881.12
no

1878.559 --> 1881.12
that was it

1881.6 --> 1888.6
all right

1884.08 --> 1888.6
hey flatter sage good to see you

1895.519 --> 1899.76
did i watch the pool table video uh

1900.32 --> 1903.2
nah i kind of flicked through i didn't

1901.919 --> 1904.8400000000001
really watch it

1903.2 --> 1906.559
too watching

1904.84 --> 1909.519
already

1906.559 --> 1909.519
too many things

1916.32 --> 1919.32
sorry

1926.399 --> 1931.279
it really does happen a lot

1928.799 --> 1932.8799999999999
i have to be fair about it

1931.279 --> 1936.88
it's that

1932.88 --> 1938.159
yeah there's like a lot of videos but

1936.88 --> 1941.1200000000001
something might have a lot of

1938.159 --> 1942.159
interesting details to one person

1941.12 --> 1944.559
but then

1942.159 --> 1946.7990000000002
it doesn't really work for me

1944.559 --> 1948.8799999999999
and then i'm like yeah i can now spend

1946.799 --> 1951.36
like what is it

1948.88 --> 1953.6000000000001
10 minutes to an hour watching something

1951.36 --> 1956.08
when i kind of already feel that i'm not

1953.6 --> 1958.9599999999998
really gonna get anything out of it

1956.08 --> 1961.96
and i don't i don't want to do that it's

1958.96 --> 1961.96
intuitive

1967.679 --> 1973.2
doesn't mean that it's a bad video it

1970.799 --> 1974.399
just often means that it's just not

1973.2 --> 1977.6000000000001
meant for me

1974.399 --> 1982.12
in that moment

1977.6 --> 1982.12
hey slow mo moon buggy good to see you

2008.559 --> 2012.08
man it's

2010.399 --> 2015.08
cold in here

2012.08 --> 2015.08
freaky

2019.44 --> 2023.3600000000001
it's kind of weird because when it just

2021.12 --> 2028.5189999999998
looked that way it almost makes me feel

2023.36 --> 2028.519
warm but it's actually cold here

2042.32 --> 2046.36
go batman what

2051.599 --> 2055.56
is that like a new one

2078.56 --> 2081.599
ah it's a new one

2082.24 --> 2085.24
okay

2091.599 --> 2096.56
was it like three days ago

2094.0 --> 2099.2
and i went out for groceries

2096.56 --> 2101.92
there was somebody in a batman costume

2099.2 --> 2104.16
literally like in a pretty serious like

2101.92 --> 2104.16
one

2105.2 --> 2110.48
just walking around in that

2107.599 --> 2112.6400000000003
that was weird

2110.48 --> 2115.44
it's like what oh he was wearing

2112.64 --> 2118.4
sunglasses also

2115.44 --> 2121.28
he didn't have a mask on though

2118.4 --> 2121.28
just like what

2124.4 --> 2128.4
more like a detective movie okay

2127.28 --> 2131.8390000000004
okay that

2128.4 --> 2135.96
that does sound kind of interesting

2131.839 --> 2135.96
i'll i'll check it out

2167.92 --> 2174.32
grounded batman our fantasies

2170.96 --> 2174.32
okay so it's like a

2177.2 --> 2182.2799999999997
what do you call that

2178.72 --> 2182.2799999999997
a prelude

2186.64 --> 2191.7999999999997
sounds

2187.76 --> 2191.8
kind of interesting i guess

2200.56 --> 2204.72
no howard moore it does not make sense

2205.28 --> 2210.079
yeah midnight the sun is not there

2210.96 --> 2215.2400000000002
where it is it's nowhere

2220.72 --> 2226.8799999999997
yeah i know you really want to complete

2224.079 --> 2229.76
that circle in your mind and say oh it's

2226.88 --> 2233.04
a circle it's a certain yeah no it isn't

2229.76 --> 2236.32
you don't ever see that it's just

2233.04 --> 2239.64
front side of the horizon to the other

2236.32 --> 2239.6400000000003
that's it

2242.24 --> 2246.3999999999996
you think owen might be right about the

2244.0 --> 2249.44
golden gate rich what

2246.4 --> 2249.44
did i miss something

2250.48 --> 2255.72
what about the golden gate bridge when

2252.48 --> 2255.72
was that

2263.04 --> 2268.16
you would probably

2264.96 --> 2271.16
even want it dude i am monetized

2268.16 --> 2271.16
troll

2289.2 --> 2293.2799999999997
it will be daylight somewhere else yeah

2293.44 --> 2298.4
but not at midnight

2295.44 --> 2299.599
right because the sun only exists when

2298.4 --> 2302.64
you see it

2299.599 --> 2306.7200000000003
it's an apparition it's a hologram if

2302.64 --> 2306.72
you don't see it it doesn't exist

2307.52 --> 2312.96
it's only an apparent manifestation in

2310.079 --> 2315.76
relation to the observer you see

2312.96 --> 2317.28
with with very specific angular

2315.76 --> 2319.92
clockwork-like

2317.28 --> 2319.92
relations

2321.68 --> 2327.839
it's not actually a lamp

2324.16 --> 2327.839
in any specific location

2328.64 --> 2334.4
like an object in euclidean space

2332.64 --> 2336.0
it was on the wizard wars and well

2334.4 --> 2338.1600000000003
really

2336.0 --> 2341.839
man i must have

2338.16 --> 2343.92
like gone cooking while that part was on

2341.839 --> 2344.7999999999997
sometimes i forget to pause the show

2343.92 --> 2347.359
when i

2344.8 --> 2352.2000000000003
leave my room

2347.359 --> 2352.2
can you summarize slow mo moon buggy

2357.599 --> 2362.6400000000003
possibly the golden gate bridge being

2359.839 --> 2365.359
taken down

2362.64 --> 2368.56
well it does seem to be a very popular

2365.359 --> 2371.68
target in disaster movies

2368.56 --> 2371.68
haven't you noticed that

2371.76 --> 2377.3590000000004
like a lot of disaster movies show that

2374.64 --> 2380.839
freaking bridge getting destroyed

2377.359 --> 2384.0
alien invasions or

2380.839 --> 2386.24
whatever world getting destroyed those

2384.0 --> 2389.92
types of they always freaking draw in

2386.24 --> 2392.16
that bridge and just like mutilate it or

2389.92 --> 2395.04
blow it up or

2392.16 --> 2397.839
something right

2395.04 --> 2397.839
i have noticed that

2400.079 --> 2403.3590000000004
but

2400.96 --> 2404.8
what makes him say it's going to be

2403.359 --> 2407.04
taken down

2404.8 --> 2407.04
how

2408.319 --> 2412.64
or was that about like closing it off

2410.56 --> 2415.04
the kind of like

2412.64 --> 2415.04
i don't know

2416.24 --> 2420.72
i vaguely remember something

2418.64 --> 2425.4
that he did mention it i think it was

2420.72 --> 2425.3999999999996
about like strategies and all that

2431.599 --> 2435.04
it is always seen yeah

2434.079 --> 2440.2400000000002
yet

2435.04 --> 2440.24
because every observer has their own son

2440.96 --> 2447.7200000000003
because it's a hologram it only exists

2443.44 --> 2447.7200000000003
because it's there to be seen

2459.52 --> 2464.24
but that's right there's always

2461.359 --> 2467.48
somewhere on earth where the apparition

2464.24 --> 2467.4799999999996
is seen

2468.4 --> 2475.04
but that doesn't mean it exists where it

2471.44 --> 2475.04
isn't seen it it doesn't

2476.48 --> 2481.839
because it's just an apparition

2478.8 --> 2481.8390000000004
it's just a hologram

2498.56 --> 2506.119
ready for its close-up oh needs

2501.04 --> 2506.119
maintenance you mean other andrew okay

2509.55 --> 2512.679
[Music]

2521.119 --> 2526.6400000000003
remember that crazy scene

2523.92 --> 2527.92
from like what is it

2526.64 --> 2529.52
uh

2527.92 --> 2532.2400000000002
the x-men

2529.52 --> 2535.44
three with the juggernaut and all that

2532.24 --> 2540.0789999999997
where magneto literally just breaks off

2535.44 --> 2540.079
the golden gate bridge and and

2540.16 --> 2547.1189999999997
relays it to this island

2543.44 --> 2548.48
the supposed prison island that's there

2547.119 --> 2550.88
i don't know if it's even there in

2548.48 --> 2551.839
reality but that's how the movie was set

2550.88 --> 2553.76
up

2551.839 --> 2556.4
like there's always something happening

2553.76 --> 2556.4
with that thing

2558.4 --> 2562.1600000000003
who controls the holographic sun

2562.839 --> 2568.88
uh nobody it's set it's set on a path

2570.4 --> 2575.839
an apparent path it's just yeah who set

2573.2 --> 2579.2799999999997
the clock who set the sky clock well

2575.839 --> 2581.44
the designer of the sky clock set it

2579.28 --> 2584.6800000000003
which i think is the same designer of

2581.44 --> 2584.68
the realm

2626.24 --> 2629.24
hmm

2634.0 --> 2637.0
um

2659.52 --> 2663.24
so anything else

2675.76 --> 2679.0400000000004
dude

2676.8 --> 2680.5600000000004
like other andrew why do you even know

2679.04 --> 2682.56
that

2680.56 --> 2686.0
serious

2682.56 --> 2686.0
or did you just google it

2686.319 --> 2690.319
weird

2688.319 --> 2692.319
holy craps do not occurred actually

2690.319 --> 2693.7599999999998
except

2692.319 --> 2696.8
they do

2693.76 --> 2699.8
that's just a statement without any

2696.8 --> 2699.8
backing

2708.0 --> 2715.52
yeah hotel fun biscuit hey hey how about

2712.8 --> 2715.52
a rainbow

2715.92 --> 2721.359
a rainbow is a hologram

2718.64 --> 2724.16
provably palpably

2721.359 --> 2727.2
does it not occur in nature

2724.16 --> 2731.24
you're just wrong

2727.2 --> 2731.24
otto von biscuit

2732.0 --> 2735.319
is just silly

2738.81 --> 2741.88
[Music]

2750.319 --> 2753.92
hey that flat fellow good to see you

2756.88 --> 2761.839
oh man time is flying that's crazy

2769.68 --> 2773.44
is it okay to say god did it

2773.52 --> 2777.92
without for excuse me without further

2776.0 --> 2779.599
investigation

2777.92 --> 2782.48
what are you talking about

2779.599 --> 2785.04
without further investigation am i not

2782.48 --> 2787.359
further investigating i'm literally the

2785.04 --> 2788.64
only one really even investigating this

2787.359 --> 2790.4
concept

2788.64 --> 2793.04
for the concept that is it that it

2790.4 --> 2793.04
really is

2793.76 --> 2799.76
i am investigating it constantly there's

2796.319 --> 2802.56
just not a lot that i can really do

2799.76 --> 2807.28
except pay attention

2802.56 --> 2807.2799999999997
and theorize about what i'm seeing

2810.64 --> 2815.68
holograms and such

2813.839 --> 2818.0
yeah well duh

2815.68 --> 2820.56
i've already laid out several ways to

2818.0 --> 2820.56
basically

2822.88 --> 2825.599
disprove

2826.24 --> 2832.56
right there would be tests that disprove

2829.44 --> 2832.56
they are holograms

2832.8 --> 2836.6400000000003
right by proving the opposite

2838.16 --> 2843.2
right

2838.96 --> 2847.359
objects in euclidean positions or

2843.2 --> 2849.52
even just that it is an apparition

2847.359 --> 2851.92
something a manifestation something

2849.52 --> 2854.88
electrical nature would be the first

2851.92 --> 2857.599
guess that is in the euclidean position

2854.88 --> 2858.7200000000003
actually somewhere over earth

2857.599 --> 2861.76
right

2858.72 --> 2863.4399999999996
well there would absolutely be things

2861.76 --> 2866.2400000000002
you could do to

2863.44 --> 2867.44
verify that it is that

2866.24 --> 2869.68
approach

2867.44 --> 2871.44
angular size increase

2869.68 --> 2873.9199999999996
during your approach

2871.44 --> 2876.48
right that would indicate euclidean

2873.92 --> 2877.44
nature also it would back

2876.48 --> 2879.839
the

2877.44 --> 2881.76
inverse square law of light light would

2879.839 --> 2885.04
get more intense as you get closer

2881.76 --> 2886.7200000000003
measurably etc etc all these indicators

2885.04 --> 2889.92
would

2886.72 --> 2892.16
prove that it is actually a

2889.92 --> 2894.96
light manifestation somehow in a

2892.16 --> 2898.16
specific location over earth well there

2894.96 --> 2901.359
is no such data

2898.16 --> 2903.359
so good luck with that ah

2901.359 --> 2905.5989999999997
it's a hologram

2903.359 --> 2907.5989999999997
there's no indicator that it is any kind

2905.599 --> 2909.76
of manifestation or object in a

2907.599 --> 2912.7200000000003
euclidean position because there's no

2909.76 --> 2915.44
data to back that assertion

2912.72 --> 2918.5589999999997
you see

2915.44 --> 2918.559
that's my position

2920.8 --> 2924.1600000000003
but they've already even suggested like

2922.4 --> 2925.839
yeah why don't you go do an icarus test

2924.16 --> 2928.24
then right

2925.839 --> 2930.96
do an icarus test

2928.24 --> 2932.9599999999996
send out something like a mini blimp

2930.96 --> 2935.2
drone or something

2932.96 --> 2936.7200000000003
with the camera and just send it right

2935.2 --> 2940.5589999999997
to the sun

2936.72 --> 2943.52
see what happens film it all the way

2940.559 --> 2945.599
right a balloon wouldn't really work

2943.52 --> 2947.92
because like it's yeah you can't aim the

2945.599 --> 2948.96
camera properly

2947.92 --> 2950.4
only if

2948.96 --> 2952.319
you're lucky

2950.4 --> 2953.839
a couple of good shots

2952.319 --> 2956.24
and it's really hard to aim where

2953.839 --> 2957.7599999999998
they're gonna end up

2956.24 --> 2959.7599999999998
like are you actually going to be able

2957.76 --> 2961.8390000000004
to aim the balloon

2959.76 --> 2963.8390000000004
launch in such a way that it will like

2961.839 --> 2967.44
directly hit

2963.839 --> 2969.7599999999998
the apparent sun position

2967.44 --> 2972.079
it's all kind of difficult right so i

2969.76 --> 2975.3590000000004
would recommend more like a zap micro

2972.079 --> 2976.88
zeppelin drone or something

2975.359 --> 2979.359
to attempt that

2976.88 --> 2981.599
and just let's see okay well

2979.359 --> 2984.48
you're going towards the sun is there an

2981.599 --> 2986.559
angular size increase of the apparition

2984.48 --> 2988.64
how about the reading of the the light

2986.559 --> 2990.6400000000003
intensity is it increasing

2988.64 --> 2992.7999999999997
is it increasing at an apparent linear

2990.64 --> 2995.52
rate as you approach with the consistent

2992.8 --> 2997.119
speed etc etc all this

2995.52 --> 3000.88
would be very

2997.119 --> 3003.6800000000003
vital data to support

3000.88 --> 3005.28
anything about the nature of what i call

3003.68 --> 3008.319
the hologram

3005.28 --> 3008.3190000000004
the sun hologram

3008.88 --> 3016.319
so you don't believe in holograms oh

3013.44 --> 3018.96
they're that's aw

3016.319 --> 3021.359
he doesn't believe in holograms i'm so

3018.96 --> 3021.359
sorry

3022.8 --> 3027.079
so sorry you can't handle that

3036.48 --> 3041.52
are you excited about a telescope no no

3039.359 --> 3043.359
not really

3041.52 --> 3047.8
i mean what's the point

3043.359 --> 3047.7999999999997
that we have enough telescopes already

3059.76 --> 3062.76
so

3074.319 --> 3079.44
hey bill nye the sign tonight

3076.72 --> 3079.4399999999996
lunar wave

3080.16 --> 3082.72
they're just

3081.359 --> 3084.88
they're just gonna you're just gonna

3082.72 --> 3088.839
make them squirt

3084.88 --> 3088.839
they can't handle that

3106.24 --> 3110.24
see there you go

3107.92 --> 3113.92
told you

3110.24 --> 3113.9199999999996
they can't handle the lunar wave

3114.079 --> 3119.2000000000003
it's not a thing

3116.319 --> 3119.2
of course it isn't

3122.24 --> 3128.7999999999997
i mean it was

3123.68 --> 3128.7999999999997
caught on camera moving camera no less

3130.64 --> 3139.04
right and discussed to no end so

3134.88 --> 3141.44
even in 2015 i think

3139.04 --> 3144.8
so yeah

3141.44 --> 3144.8
it is definitely a thing

3150.24 --> 3157.52
a camera malfunction no no it's not

3154.24 --> 3158.5589999999997
you see the camera was moving

3157.52 --> 3162.079
yeah

3158.559 --> 3164.96
yet the wave stayed in a persistent

3162.079 --> 3166.8
position in relation to the apparent

3164.96 --> 3170.0
lunar body

3166.8 --> 3172.6400000000003
as the camera was moving yeah that's not

3170.0 --> 3174.96
how a camera malfunction works

3172.64 --> 3176.96
yeah it was a camera malfunction then

3174.96 --> 3180.559
the ripple would have stayed at the

3176.96 --> 3182.48
exact same apparent position in relation

3180.559 --> 3185.6800000000003
to the camera

3182.48 --> 3186.64
not to the lunar body

3185.68 --> 3189.2799999999997
yeah

3186.64 --> 3189.2799999999997
nice try

3189.44 --> 3194.52
it's definitely not a camera malfunction

3213.52 --> 3221.2
so the sky is not in this realm

3218.079 --> 3221.2000000000003
what does that even mean

3221.28 --> 3227.599
the sky

3223.44 --> 3227.599
the sky is definitely in this realm

3232.0 --> 3237.0
yeah it's just that the celestial lights

3237.04 --> 3241.2
it's not that they are in or out of this

3239.44 --> 3243.76
realm it's just that they're not really

3241.2 --> 3245.68
off this realm

3243.76 --> 3247.6800000000003
it's

3245.68 --> 3249.359
it exists only

3247.68 --> 3251.2
apparently

3249.359 --> 3253.7599999999998
it's a hologram all of it all of the

3251.2 --> 3257.52
celestials are holograms stars moon

3253.76 --> 3259.3590000000004
planets sun all of it

3257.52 --> 3260.72
comets

3259.359 --> 3263.359
even like

3260.72 --> 3265.9199999999996
falling star-like blips like the

3263.359 --> 3269.04
it's all holographic all of it

3265.92 --> 3272.16
that includes the infrared weird wobbly

3269.04 --> 3273.68
moving things that too is all

3272.16 --> 3278.1189999999997
holographic

3273.68 --> 3278.1189999999997
it's a giant holographic spectacle

3278.799 --> 3282.799
right

3279.76 --> 3284.96
there's no physical thing about those

3282.799 --> 3287.44
lights though that are actually in

3284.96 --> 3289.92
literal positions

3287.44 --> 3292.079
within the realm

3289.92 --> 3293.28
they don't have literal positions but

3292.079 --> 3295.44
you can

3293.28 --> 3298.1600000000003
with certain presuppositions about the

3295.44 --> 3300.319
earth's orientation surface of it

3298.16 --> 3302.96
in relation to the lights and their

3300.319 --> 3305.2799999999997
angular apparent positions

3302.96 --> 3308.2400000000002
then you could

3305.28 --> 3309.6800000000003
presuppose basically that they are

3308.24 --> 3313.68
sort of

3309.68 --> 3316.16
lining up with triangulation

3313.68 --> 3317.9199999999996
in certain models

3316.16 --> 3320.5589999999997
but in reality

3317.92 --> 3323.28
they're not really there

3320.559 --> 3324.799
because then there would be

3323.28 --> 3327.28
consequences

3324.799 --> 3330.079
like when you physically approach it

3327.28 --> 3332.3190000000004
there would be an angular size increase

3330.079 --> 3334.96
more light intensity

3332.319 --> 3339.44
output because of the infrasquare law

3334.96 --> 3339.44
etc etc there's no data for that at all

3343.119 --> 3347.2000000000003
so yeah

3344.24 --> 3348.3999999999996
the holograms appear

3347.2 --> 3352.0789999999997
to be added

3348.4 --> 3352.079
yeah at a certain distance

3352.559 --> 3356.0
but it's only appearances

3356.079 --> 3363.52
it seems to represent itself

3359.28 --> 3366.7200000000003
as a demi sphere to an observer

3363.52 --> 3370.559
at an apparent set distance that i

3366.72 --> 3370.5589999999997
basically named the

3370.72 --> 3376.7599999999998
limit of sight

3372.319 --> 3376.7599999999998
they're at on the edge of vision

3377.839 --> 3382.96
as far as you can see determines the

3379.92 --> 3385.44
distance as to where the

3382.96 --> 3388.4
holographic lights of the celestials

3385.44 --> 3391.7200000000003
appear to you

3388.4 --> 3391.7200000000003
as a hologram

3394.559 --> 3398.4
nobody is producing holograms

3397.119 --> 3400.48
this is

3398.4 --> 3402.319
uh oh that's bill nye the science there

3400.48 --> 3407.2
hilarious

3402.319 --> 3408.72
yeah it's not being artificially created

3407.2 --> 3412.24
by any

3408.72 --> 3416.3999999999996
man controlled device it's just built in

3412.24 --> 3416.3999999999996
it has to be because it was always there

3416.72 --> 3421.9199999999996
it's

3417.599 --> 3423.3590000000004
probably some kind of natural effect

3421.92 --> 3425.28
of the design

3423.359 --> 3426.0789999999997
of the entire realm and the energies

3425.28 --> 3426.88
that

3426.079 --> 3429.92
are

3426.88 --> 3429.92
taking place here

3431.68 --> 3437.44
so i've mechanically reasoned out that

3434.0 --> 3440.16
what might be able to

3437.44 --> 3441.119
cause the manifestation of them

3440.16 --> 3445.44
would be

3441.119 --> 3447.76
electric energy that's just like here

3445.44 --> 3449.44
it's in the realm it's electric energy

3447.76 --> 3450.2400000000002
in the air basically

3449.44 --> 3452.319
and

3450.24 --> 3454.3999999999996
i can't like oh let's

3452.319 --> 3456.72
do something specific and then it will

3454.4 --> 3458.7200000000003
create those little lights

3456.72 --> 3461.1189999999997
right with the electricity in the air no

3458.72 --> 3463.359
it's not like that unfortunately it's

3461.119 --> 3465.119
not that simple

3463.359 --> 3468.319
right that's not going to create the

3465.119 --> 3469.76
entire holographic effect

3468.319 --> 3474.079
it is

3469.76 --> 3476.7200000000003
potentially that the entire realm

3474.079 --> 3476.7200000000003
causes it

3477.04 --> 3482.319
who knows it might potentially be like

3480.48 --> 3484.48
god designed

3482.319 --> 3486.88
mechanisms that are even

3484.48 --> 3489.599
like directly outside of the realm that

3486.88 --> 3492.1600000000003
are causing it like a giant

3489.599 --> 3493.28
divine holographic projector

3492.16 --> 3495.2799999999997
like thing

3493.28 --> 3498.3190000000004
that lasts forever

3495.28 --> 3500.96
or until like the yeah the sky clock

3498.319 --> 3500.96
runs out

3501.359 --> 3506.4
it could be that

3503.76 --> 3506.4
i don't know

3512.4 --> 3516.48
ugh

3513.96 --> 3519.04
[Music]

3516.48 --> 3519.04
cold

3522.4 --> 3526.1600000000003
god damn it running out of tea

3527.52 --> 3530.52
hmm

3537.04 --> 3542.16
sunny means more than light the light is

3540.079 --> 3544.48
no it doesn't emit more than light it

3542.16 --> 3546.96
emits light what a ridiculous thing to

3544.48 --> 3549.68
say sun emits more than light no it

3546.96 --> 3549.68
emits light

3551.76 --> 3554.2400000000002
yeah

3553.119 --> 3556.839
heat

3554.24 --> 3558.64
infrared that's also

3556.839 --> 3562.0
light

3558.64 --> 3562.0
so is ultraviolet

3565.28 --> 3570.6400000000003
and beyond yeah well might not like

3568.0 --> 3573.52
officially classify as light but it is

3570.64 --> 3576.72
still basically light it's all light

3573.52 --> 3579.359
and holograms can create light

3576.72 --> 3581.839
even man-made ones

3579.359 --> 3586.24
you can get a tan from a hologram a

3581.839 --> 3590.24
man-made hologram that's a fact

3586.24 --> 3590.24
don't necessarily recommend that

3592.16 --> 3595.359
trying that out but i'm pretty sure you

3594.16 --> 3597.04
could

3595.359 --> 3599.04
because if you can see the light then

3597.04 --> 3600.88
there is light transferred even though

3599.04 --> 3603.68
it's not coming from

3600.88 --> 3606.559
an actual lamp but from a holographic

3603.68 --> 3606.5589999999997
manifestation

3608.72 --> 3612.16
and as long as you see the light that

3610.4 --> 3615.28
means there's light being transferred

3612.16 --> 3618.5589999999997
and that means that if you use light

3615.28 --> 3619.44
sources that actually have heat infrared

3618.559 --> 3621.28
in them

3619.44 --> 3623.04
then yeah you might

3621.28 --> 3626.2400000000002
be able to create a hologram that

3623.04 --> 3632.319
actually gives you a tan

3626.24 --> 3635.64
if you expose your skin to it a lot

3632.319 --> 3635.64
so yeah

3646.319 --> 3650.81
god there's a global flare-ups

3649.839 --> 3652.24
projecting

3650.81 --> 3654.0789999999997
[Music]

3652.24 --> 3656.8799999999997
oh no

3654.079 --> 3661.8390000000004
no satan is a glober

3656.88 --> 3663.6800000000003
master of lies and deceit and delusion

3661.839 --> 3666.68
and you're very misinformed rich

3663.68 --> 3666.68
cornwall

3681.359 --> 3685.359
infrared does not give you yeah good

3683.44 --> 3687.52
point it's more ultraviolet right well

3685.359 --> 3689.839
you can make holograms with ultraviolet

3687.52 --> 3689.839
as well

3697.04 --> 3701.44
you could technically make holograms

3699.119 --> 3703.52
with radio

3701.44 --> 3704.64
don't recommend doing that it's

3703.52 --> 3707.28
pointless

3704.64 --> 3707.2799999999997
but you could

3708.96 --> 3713.079
i'm arguing about semantics

3714.72 --> 3717.0389999999998
what

3718.319 --> 3721.64
are you doing

3727.13 --> 3730.329
[Music]

3733.65 --> 3736.849
[Music]

3738.24 --> 3742.24
where did all these numpties come from

3743.57 --> 3746.78
[Music]

3750.559 --> 3757.28
is that jose's crowd

3754.64 --> 3761.0789999999997
jose are these people normally hanging

3757.28 --> 3761.079
around in your chat

3772.48 --> 3775.48
so

3803.119 --> 3807.52
yeah they seem to be uh

3805.92 --> 3811.2400000000002
getting a little confused there i'll be

3807.52 --> 3811.24
right back in two minutes

3836.88 --> 3839.839
uh

3911.44 --> 3914.839
and i'm back

3938.0 --> 3942.0
okay that's

3939.599 --> 3944.7200000000003
too far

3942.0 --> 3948.559
crushed out getting a timeout if you say

3944.72 --> 3948.5589999999997
anything like that again at your band

3948.96 --> 3953.68
yeah

3951.28 --> 3955.52
i mean this back and forth uh it's very

3953.68 --> 3957.0389999999998
entertaining and all but yeah if you're

3955.52 --> 3959.599
gonna go there

3957.039 --> 3963.3190000000004
yeah i'm gonna definitely

3959.599 --> 3963.319
put a stop to that

3971.359 --> 3977.24
okay howard moore

3974.079 --> 3977.2400000000002
all right

3978.72 --> 3983.359
thanks for letting me know at least

3981.119 --> 3986.079
right if you're here to learn that's a

3983.359 --> 3988.799
good thing right

3986.079 --> 3990.559
let's see where that gets you

3988.799 --> 3992.4
if you're actually willing to learn or

3990.559 --> 3995.119
if you're just willing to

3992.4 --> 3996.319
try to figure out weaknesses so you

3995.119 --> 3998.88
could just

3996.319 --> 4002.119
squirt all over again

3998.88 --> 4002.119
we'll see

4016.96 --> 4019.96
um

4029.039 --> 4033.5200000000004
sometimes the arena gets heated

4031.68 --> 4037.5989999999997
well technically it's not even supposed

4033.52 --> 4037.599
to really be an arena my chat

4044.64 --> 4049.44
right as soon as it's just back and

4046.559 --> 4051.3590000000004
forth insults that's kind of disruptive

4049.44 --> 4053.28
because it also by the way just

4051.359 --> 4055.52
distracts away

4053.28 --> 4055.52
right

4055.839 --> 4059.599
from actual learning

4059.68 --> 4064.5589999999997
but yeah i thought let let's just see

4062.64 --> 4066.5589999999997
where crushed out's gonna go with that

4064.559 --> 4069.92
but then he basically overstepped the

4066.559 --> 4069.92
line that i don't allow

4070.319 --> 4076.2799999999997
what do we think of the gym i don't

4072.16 --> 4076.2799999999997
think anything about it

4076.559 --> 4080.079
i don't know

4077.92 --> 4082.319
i don't really care why should i care

4080.079 --> 4087.319
about telescopes

4082.319 --> 4087.319
what what good is that gonna do me

4099.04 --> 4102.359
hey godzilla

4149.6 --> 4156.04
oh yeah jeff gas head

4152.0 --> 4156.04
yeah i already knew that

4160.64 --> 4165.6
i don't know even by the way what that

4162.319 --> 4169.120000000001
means hoymar and charles crowd

4165.6 --> 4171.6
you mean charles flattersnath

4169.12 --> 4173.3589999999995
but yeah i knew that i knew that she was

4171.6 --> 4177.92
kind of a plant but

4173.359 --> 4180.400000000001
that's okay you know let them plant

4177.92 --> 4183.04
and let's just see what kind of fruits

4180.4 --> 4185.92
come out of that right

4183.04 --> 4189.12
like i have no problem with plants with

4185.92 --> 4191.279
people like oh we need to have somebody

4189.12 --> 4193.199
on our win to study and that's perfectly

4191.279 --> 4197.76
fine

4193.199 --> 4197.759999999999
like in a way it's kind of funny because

4197.84 --> 4202.08
that works really well because those

4199.6 --> 4204.159000000001
people pay usually on average pay more

4202.08 --> 4206.719
attention

4204.159 --> 4208.239
than just people that like to follow me

4206.719 --> 4210.08
you see

4208.239 --> 4212.4
and

4210.08 --> 4212.4
yeah

4212.96 --> 4217.92
i can teach them other things that are

4215.36 --> 4219.199
outside of well the reason they're

4217.92 --> 4222.64
coming there

4219.199 --> 4222.639999999999
can teach them behavior

4229.36 --> 4232.96
that's a sock account well

4232.0 --> 4235.28
could be

4232.96 --> 4235.28
sure

4235.36 --> 4240.96
but i don't really mind it's all fine

4238.64 --> 4240.96
right

4243.76 --> 4248.64
i mean like dude seriously like

4246.56 --> 4251.6
potentially all of the anti-flat

4248.64 --> 4253.1990000000005
earthers could be having like

4251.6 --> 4254.56
secret

4253.199 --> 4256.879999999999
deep cover

4254.56 --> 4259.120000000001
sock accounts where they actually create

4256.88 --> 4261.28
another personality and

4259.12 --> 4264.719
tried not to be an anti-flat earther and

4261.28 --> 4267.12
they could all be hanging around here

4264.719 --> 4269.28
right they typically like to do that

4267.12 --> 4270.4
that's why like a lot of the time the

4269.28 --> 4272.719
discord

4270.4 --> 4275.92
or over at nathan oakley's is completely

4272.719 --> 4277.28
full as soon as the show ends

4275.92 --> 4280.96
they like to do that so i'm not

4277.28 --> 4283.759999999999
surprised if they're hanging around here

4280.96 --> 4283.76
it's okay

4284.0 --> 4289.679
right

4286.96 --> 4291.36
it's not important whether they are to

4289.679 --> 4292.88
me at least whether they are really in

4291.36 --> 4294.48
deep cover although i like to know you

4292.88 --> 4295.76
know if you figure something out about

4294.48 --> 4298.879999999999
somebody

4295.76 --> 4300.400000000001
so i do appreciate the update

4298.88 --> 4303.6
but

4300.4 --> 4306.4
overall it's more about behavior

4303.6 --> 4309.52
and if in their covert

4306.4 --> 4310.639999999999
form they can learn about just like how

4309.52 --> 4314.159000000001
to

4310.64 --> 4315.280000000001
actually do this sort of thing online

4314.159 --> 4316.48
and

4315.28 --> 4318.719
let

4316.48 --> 4321.759999999999
like psychological study but also

4318.719 --> 4323.84
behavioral correction which also means

4321.76 --> 4326.400000000001
outburst sometimes and then correcting

4323.84 --> 4329.360000000001
right all that just about behavior

4326.4 --> 4331.5199999999995
they can literally ride along with this

4329.36 --> 4333.36
and actually learn that as they were

4331.52 --> 4334.2390000000005
kind of hoping to like oh maybe he's

4333.36 --> 4336.159
gonna

4334.239 --> 4338.48
say something silly about flat earth or

4336.159 --> 4340.32
the ball that's wrong and then we can

4338.48 --> 4342.639999999999
squirt over that right

4340.32 --> 4344.32
but in the meantime they're actually

4342.64 --> 4348.2390000000005
studying

4344.32 --> 4349.92
normal human correct behavior here

4348.239 --> 4352.959999999999
and natural

4349.92 --> 4354.56
expression and how to deal with it

4352.96 --> 4355.52
even though they didn't come here for

4354.56 --> 4357.84
that

4355.52 --> 4357.84
right

4360.48 --> 4364.639999999999
the best way to

4362.32 --> 4367.759999999999
defeat your enemy

4364.64 --> 4371.159000000001
is by teaching them how to not be your

4367.76 --> 4371.159000000001
enemy anymore

4377.84 --> 4384.84
damn it i miss my tea

4380.719 --> 4384.84
i'm not gonna make another pop

4391.84 --> 4398.12
before flat earth started calling

4395.12 --> 4398.12
oh

4398.96 --> 4403.679
you're so poor oh it's all mistreatment

4402.0 --> 4405.52
oh

4403.679 --> 4407.84
yeah i don't really care

4405.52 --> 4410.400000000001
somebody start calling your question

4407.84 --> 4410.400000000001
stupid

4411.52 --> 4416.400000000001
i care about that you overstepped the

4414.32 --> 4417.36
line

4416.4 --> 4419.679
yeah

4417.36 --> 4423.199
you chose to engage in the bickering

4419.679 --> 4425.92
with flatter sage i mean

4423.199 --> 4428.799999999999
nobody's forcing you to do that right if

4425.92 --> 4431.52
you hadn't engaged you would have just

4428.8 --> 4433.6
left it there maybe mocked at you

4431.52 --> 4434.8
from a distance a bit and then just left

4433.6 --> 4438.08
it right

4434.8 --> 4438.08
but you engaged

4438.8 --> 4444.320000000001
i thought that overall flatter sage has

4440.8 --> 4444.320000000001
been very polite

4445.28 --> 4450.48
with his bickering with you

4448.159 --> 4451.36
and then you didn't you overstepped the

4450.48 --> 4455.44
line

4451.36 --> 4460.0
right he's calling you a child

4455.44 --> 4460.0
that's because of the behavioral level

4463.36 --> 4469.839999999999
yes it's humiliating being called a

4465.36 --> 4469.839999999999
child but yeah if they have a point

pedophilia that's

4624.8 --> 4630.400000000001
[ __ ] up that's him being there with

4628.159 --> 4632.5599999999995
his mind and then projecting it outward

4630.4 --> 4636.599999999999
like that's what you meant that's really

4632.56 --> 4636.6
[ __ ] up demonic behavior

in my chat

4735.52 --> 4738.76
go away

4749.04 --> 4755.84
the weekends always bring out the trolls

4752.48 --> 4757.5199999999995
sometimes not always that very nice calm

4755.84 --> 4759.52
sundays

4757.52 --> 4761.280000000001
but they're all stressed out right all

4759.52 --> 4762.4800000000005
these freaking demons are all stressed

4761.28 --> 4765.199
out because they fear they're going to

4762.48 --> 4765.199
be punished

4765.28 --> 4767.5199999999995
right

4769.679 --> 4773.76
because of putin

4771.76 --> 4776.159000000001
putin big daddy

4773.76 --> 4778.96
is there to punish them they're all

4776.159 --> 4781.28
terrified they're all saturated

4778.96 --> 4782.719
with the demonic propaganda and now

4781.28 --> 4784.8
that's what they

4782.719 --> 4788.2390000000005
yeah they're squirting all day long

4784.8 --> 4791.1990000000005
they have a lot a lot of fear to shed

4788.239 --> 4793.599999999999
because they they they're afraid that

4791.199 --> 4796.08
daddy putin's gonna spank them really

4793.6 --> 4796.08
badly

4796.96 --> 4801.679
because they deserve it

4798.8 --> 4805.679
because they're disgusting little

4801.679 --> 4808.8
demonic possessed entities

4805.679 --> 4811.4400000000005
they're just goblins possessed by demons

4808.8 --> 4813.92
constantly thinking about really

4811.44 --> 4815.5199999999995
disgusting things and projecting that

4813.92 --> 4817.84
onto everybody

4815.52 --> 4820.88
and making horrific decisions for their

4817.84 --> 4820.88
own life and others

4821.92 --> 4826.0
and they're afraid

4823.92 --> 4829.0
so they'll be they'd be squirting right

4826.0 --> 4829.0
now

4845.28 --> 4850.5199999999995
yeah at a price don't worry i'm on it

4881.679 --> 4885.76
yes matthew hall

4883.44 --> 4885.759999999999
yeah

4886.56 --> 4890.400000000001
i know they're at the bottom right

4894.8 --> 4902.84
they've taken black pills

4898.4 --> 4902.839999999999
and now they're stuck there

4904.719 --> 4908.96
they just seek out the worst most

4906.96 --> 4912.8
outrageous disgusting things and then

4908.96 --> 4916.679
they dwell there all day in their heads

4912.8 --> 4916.679
literally a living nightmare

4920.8 --> 4928.2390000000005
right it's the same kind of people that

4924.719 --> 4929.92
i i would guess it would be

4928.239 --> 4931.04
i think a pretty decent guess that

4929.92 --> 4933.4400000000005
they've

4931.04 --> 4935.12
like have made a habit of it like even

4933.44 --> 4937.199
watching snuff films and that kind of

4935.12 --> 4940.5599999999995
crap right because that

4937.199 --> 4940.5599999999995
makes you demonic

4941.12 --> 4946.48
so they watch the worst of the worst yet

4943.76 --> 4949.76
and then they become that

4946.48 --> 4953.5199999999995
they lose their normal sensibility

4949.76 --> 4953.52
they become fully demon possessed

4954.8 --> 4960.8
what is blackpill

4957.44 --> 4960.799999999999
is waking up to doom

4965.92 --> 4971.1990000000005
waking up to like really bad [ __ ] up

4968.88 --> 4975.28
things about the world

4971.199 --> 4977.919999999999
and nobody can really handle that that's

4975.28 --> 4979.36
it's only really black pill if nobody

4977.92 --> 4981.76
can handle it

4979.36 --> 4984.159
really handle it without losing their

4981.76 --> 4986.56
faculties

4984.159 --> 4990.239
so it's always like the grossest of

4986.56 --> 4993.52
grossest disgusting evil things

4990.239 --> 4995.5199999999995
there is there is that [ __ ] out there

4993.52 --> 4997.280000000001
you should never

4995.52 --> 4999.52
engage with that

4997.28 --> 5001.84
out of curiosity because you lose

4999.52 --> 5001.84
everything

5002.88 --> 5006.2390000000005
you lose your sensibility

5009.04 --> 5011.84
they're beyond help after black bill

5010.88 --> 5015.1990000000005
yeah

5011.84 --> 5017.1990000000005
well a lot of these troll people that do

5015.199 --> 5018.32
like put down these disgusting things

5017.199 --> 5021.04
and

5018.32 --> 5024.239
outrageous accusations

5021.04 --> 5026.8
they've tapped into that

5024.239 --> 5029.839999999999
that sort of thing they looked

5026.8 --> 5032.08
and it destroyed them

5029.84 --> 5033.76
because they could not handle that at

5032.08 --> 5036.159
all

5033.76 --> 5038.320000000001
but they couldn't yeah like really

5036.159 --> 5041.599999999999
defend against it either and then it

5038.32 --> 5044.88
becomes them it possesses them

5041.6 --> 5046.2390000000005
they become obsessed with it

5044.88 --> 5048.4800000000005
and that's

5046.239 --> 5050.08
like that is like telltale sign for

5048.48 --> 5054.36
demonic possession

5050.08 --> 5054.36
they become obsessed with it

5059.76 --> 5064.08
all right and that's part of the reason

5061.44 --> 5067.678999999999
why i don't freaking talk about that

5064.08 --> 5069.04
garbage i don't go there

5067.679 --> 5071.04
because

5069.04 --> 5073.84
i've kind of

5071.04 --> 5075.92
tapped into such things

5073.84 --> 5079.92
and it

5075.92 --> 5079.92
i still bear the scars today

5080.719 --> 5085.84
it's so it [ __ ] you up so bad

5088.0 --> 5090.4
just

5088.96 --> 5092.639
letting your eyes

5090.4 --> 5095.04
see things like that it [ __ ] you up so

5092.639 --> 5097.28
bad if you're kind of sensitive it's so

5095.04 --> 5097.28
bad

5097.36 --> 5102.239
right

5099.44 --> 5104.96
i had times where i was like in school

5102.239 --> 5108.08
like with internet or like networks

5104.96 --> 5109.12
and people would literally just

5108.08 --> 5111.6
shove

5109.12 --> 5114.08
snuff films up there

5111.6 --> 5117.04
right soup and like secretly it was

5114.08 --> 5118.639
absolutely illegal those people would be

5117.04 --> 5120.239
well unless they were like hacker types

5118.639 --> 5122.56
they would absolutely be kicked out of

5120.239 --> 5124.159
the school of course

5122.56 --> 5127.4400000000005
but there would still be people just

5124.159 --> 5130.638999999999
watching that right like in the freaking

5127.44 --> 5132.799999999999
open room with other people

5130.639 --> 5135.6
and i would literally like

5132.8 --> 5137.6
like turn that [ __ ] thing off right

5135.6 --> 5141.120000000001
now

5137.6 --> 5144.320000000001
i would be so pissed off

5141.12 --> 5146.5599999999995
and people would just do that just watch

5144.32 --> 5149.759999999999
it like it's not real and it is real

5146.56 --> 5153.639
it's super [ __ ] up

5149.76 --> 5153.639
and just yeah

5154.0 --> 5158.239
ugh

5155.6 --> 5158.2390000000005
that was like

5160.159 --> 5165.4
what is it

5161.84 --> 5165.400000000001
20 years ago

5168.0 --> 5173.199
yeah don't remember those videos i'm

5170.239 --> 5174.879999999999
sorry i even brought it up

5173.199 --> 5177.599999999999
oh you're not talking about that what

5174.88 --> 5179.92
i'm talking about okay fine

5177.6 --> 5179.92
uh

5180.84 --> 5186.2390000000005
i god borders boy don't please

5190.239 --> 5194.08
just be careful because when you

5192.48 --> 5195.04
literally

5194.08 --> 5198.8
say it

5195.04 --> 5201.36
that's already like it triggers ptsd man

5198.8 --> 5203.679
that's why i tried not to say it all the

5201.36 --> 5203.679
time

5204.4 --> 5208.32
and what was describing right it's it's

5206.4 --> 5210.638999999999
a trick

5208.32 --> 5212.719
that i can do and i even use it to

5210.639 --> 5214.2390000000005
basically talk about everything and what

5212.719 --> 5216.4800000000005
i'm doing my show

5214.239 --> 5218.799999999999
my community like without actually

5216.48 --> 5220.239
saying it's about flat earth

5218.8 --> 5222.320000000001
i just say like no that's just

5220.239 --> 5225.36
philosophical consequences within the

5222.32 --> 5226.88
realms of physics

5225.36 --> 5229.44
and then i can describe everything

5226.88 --> 5230.32
without saying flat earth once right

5229.44 --> 5232.96
well

5230.32 --> 5235.679
it would be generally good

5232.96 --> 5237.679
for conspiracy theory

5235.679 --> 5240.159
interested people

5237.679 --> 5244.32
to apply that thank you for deleting the

5240.159 --> 5245.839999999999
message borders boy to apply that

5244.32 --> 5246.96
i don't know what that was by the way

5245.84 --> 5247.76
but

5246.96 --> 5249.679
yeah

5247.76 --> 5252.400000000001
uh

5249.679 --> 5254.719
realizing that it is there's things that

5252.4 --> 5259.12
are super traumatic and you shouldn't

5254.719 --> 5261.199
remind people about that because they it

5259.12 --> 5266.199
it literally opens up a can that you

5261.199 --> 5266.199
shouldn't open up it's just terror

5274.56 --> 5277.96
oh god

5280.0 --> 5282.639
yeah dx it's

5281.6 --> 5287.04
bad

5282.639 --> 5287.84
and yeah young kids do that

5287.04 --> 5291.36
like

5287.84 --> 5291.360000000001
i've been in situations

5291.84 --> 5296.4800000000005
where i was just like ooh going out

5294.239 --> 5298.159
partying just dumping a beer in some

5296.48 --> 5300.5599999999995
cafe somewhere

5298.159 --> 5303.04
and then just like sitting outside just

5300.56 --> 5304.8
smoking looking for a conversation and

5303.04 --> 5307.04
then i would just bump into a guy that

5304.8 --> 5309.6
would literally watching those types of

5307.04 --> 5311.44
videos on this freaking mobile

5309.6 --> 5313.1990000000005
it's like what the [ __ ] is wrong with

5311.44 --> 5315.759999999999
you

5313.199 --> 5317.678999999999
like i didn't look at it but as soon as

5315.76 --> 5319.679
i didn't look at it once until i

5317.679 --> 5322.719
realized what he was doing there it's

5319.679 --> 5325.84
like what the [ __ ] are you doing

5322.719 --> 5328.4
turn that off and he just refused to do

5325.84 --> 5329.76
that he was like no i want to watch this

5328.4 --> 5332.08
right here

5329.76 --> 5335.92
i was like ready to like take his

5332.08 --> 5337.5199999999995
freaking mobile and shove it up his ass

5335.92 --> 5339.92
i was like like

5339.92 --> 5345.6

5342.48 --> 5345.599999999999
you're violating

5346.159 --> 5350.48
my spirit

5347.6 --> 5351.4400000000005
by doing that in my presence

5350.48 --> 5353.199
like

5351.44 --> 5355.678999999999
if you're gonna have that kind of

5353.199 --> 5358.638999999999
interest you should literally lock

5355.679 --> 5361.639
yourself in your basement until you die

5358.639 --> 5361.639
scum

5364.32 --> 5369.759999999999

5369.76 --> 5372.8
past

i've seen

5372.8 --> 5379.639
situations and things that are i cannot

5376.639 --> 5379.639
justify

5380.719 --> 5384.08
and sometimes when it comes back to me

5382.8 --> 5387.52
all of it

5384.08 --> 5390.719
it is like ptsd it's like oh my god what

5387.52 --> 5390.719
the [ __ ] is this

5390.84 --> 5395.12
place it's so bad

5393.6 --> 5397.360000000001
sometimes

5395.12 --> 5399.679
how where people go and they have no

5397.36 --> 5401.199
limitation they do not restrict

5399.679 --> 5402.96
themselves

5401.199 --> 5406.28
and it's

5402.96 --> 5406.28
it's maddening

5414.719 --> 5418.4
why would they watch that

5417.6 --> 5420.8
well

5418.4 --> 5423.44
multiple reasons

5420.8 --> 5425.28
i think that that kid that i

5423.44 --> 5427.36
was just referencing was probably

5425.28 --> 5429.759999999999
watching it because they hated their dad

5427.36 --> 5433.12
or something

5429.76 --> 5437.84
right and then they just project that

5433.12 --> 5441.679
their dad onto the victim in the video

5437.84 --> 5441.679
i think that's probably the reason

5442.159 --> 5446.28
it's just

5443.28 --> 5446.28
terrible

5449.28 --> 5454.599999999999
it's so immoral but yeah

5462.159 --> 5465.679
no different than peeps watching horror

5463.92 --> 5468.0
movies

5465.679 --> 5468.0
yeah

5468.159 --> 5475.239
well it's a little different but

5470.56 --> 5475.2390000000005
it's not that far away from it

5484.719 --> 5489.84
right but yeah horror movies

5487.679 --> 5492.8
i mean it's like what is even a horror

5489.84 --> 5493.76
movie if it's just like gross gore yeah

5492.8 --> 5495.84
that's

5493.76 --> 5497.4400000000005
just disgusting

5495.84 --> 5501.92
but i mean

5497.44 --> 5501.919999999999
a good thriller or ghost story

5502.0 --> 5506.0
right as long as it's not just

5503.6 --> 5506.96
constantly gross out

5506.0 --> 5510.48
like a

5506.96 --> 5512.2390000000005
tariff terrible

5510.48 --> 5514.718999999999
death scene

5512.239 --> 5516.159
can like

5514.719 --> 5519.28
yeah it can

5516.159 --> 5520.32
enhance the tension and like the stakes

5519.28 --> 5522.88
right

5520.32 --> 5524.719
if it's not just a gore fest which is

5522.88 --> 5526.639
really gross

5524.719 --> 5528.88
so but yeah that's about movie making

5526.639 --> 5528.88
it's

5530.56 --> 5534.56
but i don't like really gross movies

5533.36 --> 5538.159
like that

5534.56 --> 5540.4800000000005
i mean i used to be like fan of one

5538.159 --> 5542.159
movie ironically what is it called brain

5540.48 --> 5547.44
dead

5542.159 --> 5549.199
god that movie is is pure just gore it's

5547.44 --> 5552.799999999999
pure gore

5549.199 --> 5554.5599999999995
but it had a really weird psycho comedy

5552.8 --> 5558.0
in it as well and it was kind of

5554.56 --> 5560.159000000001
fascinating with that a little bit

5558.0 --> 5562.239
but it like that movie makes you sick

5560.159 --> 5565.12
like it makes me physically i would

5562.239 --> 5568.4
never watch that again

5565.12 --> 5568.4
it's really gross

5570.88 --> 5576.719
but it has kind of funny weird psycho

5574.239 --> 5576.718999999999
moments

5579.52 --> 5583.6
it's a crazy movie

5582.32 --> 5587.5599999999995
don't watch it

5583.6 --> 5587.56
unless you want to get sick

5589.199 --> 5592.4
right but the difference still is is

5591.04 --> 5594.88
that at least

5592.4 --> 5596.879999999999
you know that's fiction

5594.88 --> 5600.639
like what you're actually watching at

5596.88 --> 5603.639
are props it's not real right

5600.639 --> 5603.639
that's

5604.719 --> 5609.28
a lot better than

5606.239 --> 5610.799999999999
when you kind of know it's real or

5609.28 --> 5613.12
at least it's

5610.8 --> 5617.4800000000005
suggested like it's not

5613.12 --> 5617.48
openly admitted that it's fake

5624.719 --> 5631.44
the finality for me was the song oh god

5627.84 --> 5634.400000000001
i hate the song movies

5631.44 --> 5639.879999999999
i i ugh

5634.4 --> 5639.879999999999
like that yuck yeah i don't i hate those

5652.719 --> 5655.6
yeah exactly

5655.679 --> 5661.12
it is like cell form it's spiritual

5658.0 --> 5662.88
self-harm if you if you really get into

5661.12 --> 5665.5199999999995
that

5662.88 --> 5666.400000000001
you should never do that

5665.52 --> 5668.96
right

5666.4 --> 5673.12
i just i feel sorry that i've even kind

5668.96 --> 5674.4800000000005
of made this a bit of a subject is just

5673.12 --> 5675.76
bad

5674.48 --> 5678.08
don't do it

5675.76 --> 5678.08
really

5679.28 --> 5684.88
unfortunate people love being scared but

5681.28 --> 5687.199
yeah but jeff guesthead a good thriller

5684.88 --> 5690.639
is kick-ass

5687.199 --> 5690.638999999999
like really spooky

5690.88 --> 5695.1990000000005
it's scary

5692.8 --> 5698.400000000001
right but it doesn't have to be

5695.199 --> 5699.759999999999
gross bloody [ __ ] and people dying and

5698.4 --> 5702.08
all that

5699.76 --> 5705.360000000001
it can just be really scary

5702.08 --> 5707.92
like for example where's the

5705.36 --> 5707.92
cold again

5708.719 --> 5712.119
look it up

5717.76 --> 5722.0
i don't mean jump scare moves i hate

5720.239 --> 5723.839999999999
freaking jump scare movies those are

5722.0 --> 5726.56
just [ __ ] annoying

5723.84 --> 5729.6
but actually scary things usually ghost

5726.56 --> 5731.6
orient there's some really scary [ __ ]

5729.6 --> 5735.52
fascinating and scary

5731.6 --> 5735.52
what was it again it's a series

5735.92 --> 5739.119
or is it called again

5739.44 --> 5743.159
i have a lot of movies

5753.199 --> 5758.719
damn it

5756.32 --> 5758.719
where are

5768.84 --> 5774.400000000001
they there's like three

5771.44 --> 5774.4
as a series

5775.679 --> 5778.56
i can't find it

5779.76 --> 5783.92
it's really hard to

5781.76 --> 5786.88
kind of like remember the names of such

5783.92 --> 5789.679
movies because there's so freaking many

5786.88 --> 5795.08
movies with like the names are

5789.679 --> 5795.08
are not usually very unique uh

5798.88 --> 5801.36
damn it

5802.4 --> 5806.4
i did have it on my computer right

5808.32 --> 5812.44
sorry for taking so long

5826.0 --> 5829.28
what's that it

5828.4 --> 5831.36
yeah

5829.28 --> 5834.96
it's the insidious on their four one

5831.36 --> 5839.679
they're four movies insidious

5834.96 --> 5842.719
insidious i thought was really

5839.679 --> 5845.28
captivating it was very scary

5842.719 --> 5846.719
very fascinating

5845.28 --> 5848.8
and

5846.719 --> 5850.639
i yeah i could choose to watch them

5848.8 --> 5853.119000000001
again

5850.639 --> 5854.88
i think now that i remember like though

5853.119 --> 5857.199
that was actually move when i thought

5854.88 --> 5858.08
like damn

5857.199 --> 5860.879999999999
that's

5858.08 --> 5860.88
fascinating

5863.76 --> 5866.56
and compelling

5866.8 --> 5871.119000000001
and it reminded me a lot

5869.36 --> 5874.0
a lot

5871.119 --> 5876.719
about some of my dark world experiences

5874.0 --> 5878.639
like a lot

5876.719 --> 5881.36
like the way

5878.639 --> 5883.4400000000005
they created that medium

5881.36 --> 5886.159
how it worked

5883.44 --> 5888.638999999999
i really liked it

5886.159 --> 5892.159
so yeah insidious it's four movies the

5888.639 --> 5895.04
first one in 2010 and last one

5892.159 --> 5896.638999999999
in 2018

5895.04 --> 5899.6
and it is

5896.639 --> 5902.719
like basically one movie

5899.6 --> 5902.719
in different chapters

5907.04 --> 5910.04
hereditary

5916.88 --> 5920.88
i think i've seen that i don't remember

5918.639 --> 5920.88
though

5921.6 --> 5925.84
i even might have it like on dvd

5929.44 --> 5933.759999999999
but if i don't remember it immediately

5931.84 --> 5935.04
that means i don't probably think it's

5933.76 --> 5935.92
good

5935.04 --> 5939.84
probably

5935.92 --> 5939.84
yeah because then i kind of forget

5940.96 --> 5944.88
but i really did like the insidious

5946.32 --> 5950.84
and that's kind of funny also because

5948.08 --> 5954.719
nathan does have like this slide

5950.84 --> 5957.119000000001
picture insidious wind

5954.719 --> 5960.4
and that's weird

5957.119 --> 5960.4
it's weird that he did that

5960.719 --> 5964.88
but yeah

5962.4 --> 5967.28
it's kind of like okay well

5964.88 --> 5970.719
yeah there's something to say

5967.28 --> 5970.719
to that to say that

5977.36 --> 5982.08
right yeah borders will make sure

5979.52 --> 5986.320000000001
make absolutely certain you watch them

5982.08 --> 5988.5599999999995
in the right order it's very important

5986.32 --> 5990.5599999999995
if you just start watching and like like

5988.56 --> 5992.639
number two or number three it makes no

5990.56 --> 5994.88
sense it's really important you watch it

5992.639 --> 5999.4800000000005
all in the right order because there is

5994.88 --> 5999.4800000000005
like a time factor to it

6019.199 --> 6023.199
right yeah insidious is good because

6021.04 --> 6025.04
it's really scary

6023.199 --> 6027.678999999999
it's it's scary

6025.04 --> 6030.48
it's like spiritually scary

6027.679 --> 6032.2390000000005
you're like really you you get invested

6030.48 --> 6034.08
in the souls of these people these are

6032.239 --> 6036.799999999999
not like yeah yeah

6034.08 --> 6039.5199999999995
we're gonna do a party

6036.8 --> 6040.96
stupid idiots you want to get you want

6039.52 --> 6042.88
to see get killed because they're

6040.96 --> 6046.32
freaking idiots right

6042.88 --> 6047.679
not like that at all it's like proper

6046.32 --> 6049.679
people

6047.679 --> 6051.92
that are awesome that are like

6049.679 --> 6055.119
interesting and good and real in ways

6051.92 --> 6057.4400000000005
it's very believable very convincing

6055.119 --> 6058.719
and then they go into this freaky

6057.44 --> 6060.638999999999
spiritual

6058.719 --> 6062.8
situation

6060.639 --> 6066.159000000001
it's very i thought it was really scary

6062.8 --> 6066.159000000001
when i watch that the first time

6068.0 --> 6073.679
but there's no like super gross out

6070.96 --> 6076.08
horror or there's no abundance of jump

6073.679 --> 6079.84
scare so it's like a really good movie i

6076.08 --> 6079.84
think all of them are

6086.719 --> 6091.52
right i'm gonna watch them back i think

6089.52 --> 6095.119000000001
not all at once but

6091.52 --> 6095.119000000001
because i still have it on my computer

6095.52 --> 6097.92
anyway

6101.28 --> 6106.32
can i talk about any of my dark world

6103.44 --> 6109.119
experiences

6106.32 --> 6112.08
well i could technically

6109.119 --> 6114.08
but i kind of draw it into

6112.08 --> 6116.88
what i'm talking about whenever there's

6114.08 --> 6119.28
like is something that lights up

6116.88 --> 6120.639
it's weird dark world experiences are

6119.28 --> 6122.88
very strange

6120.639 --> 6125.28
because they're kind of like unstuck in

6122.88 --> 6127.4400000000005
time in a way which is

6125.28 --> 6131.119
very similar

6127.44 --> 6132.879999999999
to what's taking place in insidious

6131.119 --> 6134.4
and that's also part of why i thought it

6132.88 --> 6136.400000000001
was really scary

6134.4 --> 6138.32
because it's just

6136.4 --> 6141.36
it's almost like

6138.32 --> 6144.719
is that about me

6141.36 --> 6144.719
what actually happened to me

6146.0 --> 6149.0
anyway

6152.639 --> 6157.679
i think also probably in ways

6156.159 --> 6159.04
um

6157.679 --> 6162.8
once again

6159.04 --> 6164.32
kind of popular series

6162.8 --> 6167.28
more recent

6164.32 --> 6167.28
what's it called again

6171.76 --> 6177.84
the stephen king based series

6174.719 --> 6177.84
very popular

6178.8 --> 6185.6
with the girl that has super powers and

6181.28 --> 6187.92
goes i yeah and there's like this dark

6185.6 --> 6187.92
thing

6188.239 --> 6192.638999999999
that she's up against this is called

6190.96 --> 6194.08
it's very popular i forgot the name

6192.639 --> 6196.8
right now but

6194.08 --> 6199.92
i think that they probably

6196.8 --> 6202.400000000001
also took a careful look

6199.92 --> 6204.8
at the insidious theory

6202.4 --> 6208.239
and how they constructed their dark

6204.8 --> 6210.88
world which is different but still

6208.239 --> 6213.959999999999
does kind of have the same influence in

6210.88 --> 6213.96
a way

6218.32 --> 6222.719
remember the name of the series i'm

6220.08 --> 6222.719
talking about

6224.32 --> 6229.119
otherwise i'm gonna have to

6226.159 --> 6233.839999999999
look it up on netflix

6229.119 --> 6233.839999999999
it is a netflix exclusive i think

6234.96 --> 6238.199
is it

6246.239 --> 6251.199
dude

6247.36 --> 6251.199
i freaking muted you

6254.159 --> 6259.599999999999
uh

6255.76 --> 6259.6
ah stranger things that's the one

6275.52 --> 6279.6
i have a

6276.639 --> 6282.08
cross on my wall which gradually falls

6279.6 --> 6286.04
to its side

6282.08 --> 6286.04
and watch that's weird

6289.36 --> 6294.5599999999995
yeah i am having a lot of psychokinetic

6291.92 --> 6297.119
activity myself

6294.56 --> 6297.119000000001
by the way

6298.639 --> 6304.400000000001
like the last time it was pretty insane

6302.4 --> 6305.92
it was not yesterday night though but

6304.4 --> 6307.92
was another time

6305.92 --> 6310.4
i was just like sitting there sleeping

6307.92 --> 6312.8
thinking like kind of stressing out

6310.4 --> 6317.119
thinking but still

6312.8 --> 6319.84
effective and then like the glass

6317.119 --> 6319.839999999999
like i have a

6321.119 --> 6324.799999999999
yeah there's

6322.639 --> 6327.04
like a closet thing with glass

6324.8 --> 6329.92
and it's like right

6327.04 --> 6333.04
right next to me like within 30

6329.92 --> 6333.04
centimeters and it just

6333.679 --> 6339.36
like what the [ __ ]

6336.8 --> 6340.8
super hard like something literally hit

6339.36 --> 6343.119
it

6340.8 --> 6344.719
right next to me and it wasn't even

6343.119 --> 6347.92
moving

6344.719 --> 6347.92
that was so freaky

6351.52 --> 6356.320000000001
it's like one of the loudest

6353.6 --> 6358.4800000000005
times i've ever had that

6356.32 --> 6361.44
so i yeah i translate that i have a lot

6358.48 --> 6364.4
of psychokinetic activity going on

6361.44 --> 6366.799999999999
it's it accompanies tension it always

6364.4 --> 6369.119
does when i'm tense that [ __ ] starts to

6366.8 --> 6369.119000000001
happen

6369.679 --> 6374.159
how much does nut flip cost i don't know

6372.08 --> 6376.4
steamy traveler i'm literally riding

6374.159 --> 6379.04
onto somebody else's

6376.4 --> 6379.04
prescription

6380.0 --> 6383.52
it's like one of the employees of my

6382.08 --> 6384.88
stepmom

6383.52 --> 6387.360000000001
has an account

6384.88 --> 6389.76
they write on that account and i ride

6387.36 --> 6392.0
along on that account so i get it for

6389.76 --> 6392.0
free

6393.44 --> 6397.36
i don't know how much it costs i have no

6395.04 --> 6397.36
idea

6399.6 --> 6402.719
i've never paid for it

6407.199 --> 6411.119
right i'm gonna take

6409.44 --> 6413.599999999999
two more minutes break and then i'm

6411.119 --> 6415.839999999999
probably gonna run out the show be right

6413.6 --> 6415.84
back

6441.76 --> 6443.84
you

6461.6 --> 6464.6
so

6513.52 --> 6515.76
you

6525.84 --> 6530.8
wow lydia loves that's your favorite

6528.32 --> 6534.639
movie really something titled that and

6530.8 --> 6534.639
that's your favorite movie

6539.44 --> 6541.839999999999
okay

6554.08 --> 6558.4
the mist was the worst thrill i've ever

6556.32 --> 6562.36
seen i don't know

6558.4 --> 6562.36
i don't think i've seen that

6576.08 --> 6579.08
hmm

6587.76 --> 6593.52
that by the way flatter stage there's a

6590.159 --> 6593.5199999999995
lot worse movies

6593.92 --> 6599.04
there are supposed thriller or horror

6596.159 --> 6601.598999999999
movies that are so unbelievably

6599.04 --> 6601.599
annoying

6601.92 --> 6606.32
that it's blatantly obvious they were

6604.0 --> 6608.08
specifically made to psychologically

6606.32 --> 6611.04
torture

6608.08 --> 6613.679
its audience to death

6611.04 --> 6615.44
like because it's not even scary it's

6613.679 --> 6618.08
just annoying

6615.44 --> 6619.5199999999995
there's some really insane productions

6618.08 --> 6622.719
out there

6619.52 --> 6624.639
one of which i've actually seen like

6622.719 --> 6626.88
during a festival it was playing

6624.639 --> 6629.04
somewhere and it was literally the worst

6626.88 --> 6630.400000000001
thing ever

6629.04 --> 6632.239
it is

6630.4 --> 6634.4
what's the freaking name again it's

6632.239 --> 6636.32
basically a bunch of women

6634.4 --> 6638.879999999999
in a car

6636.32 --> 6641.119
and they're constantly panicking and

6638.88 --> 6644.2390000000005
whining and doing the dumbest [ __ ]

6641.119 --> 6644.239
[ __ ] imaginable

6644.639 --> 6650.32
and it's so annoying

6648.0 --> 6650.32
it's

6651.119 --> 6654.5599999999995
like it's one of those movies that's so

6652.719 --> 6656.8
annoying it'll literally make you pull

6654.56 --> 6659.04
your hair out

6656.8 --> 6662.0
best thing to just walk away when when

6659.04 --> 6663.92
that's playing or change the channel or

6662.0 --> 6665.76
something

6663.92 --> 6668.639
uh

6665.76 --> 6668.639
what the hell was it

6676.8 --> 6686.52

6679.74 --> 6686.5199999999995
[Applause]

6706.4 --> 6712.159

6734.8 --> 6740.2390000000005
like hm maybe it's worth actually

6737.44 --> 6742.08
sending a bomb in the mail to the one
