right so

142.28 --> 146.879
[Music]

143.84 --> 149.92000000000002
yesterday was i don't know

146.879 --> 154.48
it's pretty calm day it's not a lot

149.92 --> 156.79999999999998
happening out there that i could spot

154.48 --> 158.72
i don't know yeah maybe like globe

156.8 --> 159.20000000000002
busters was there or something and some

158.72 --> 162.319
people

159.2 --> 164.39999999999998
undoubtedly have watched that uh i

162.319 --> 167.76
didn't

164.4 --> 171.84
uh hey there 306. hi

167.76 --> 171.84
not first

177.76 --> 183.67999999999998
i didn't catch any own benjamin either

181.68 --> 185.28
well also notice that i haven't made any

183.68 --> 188.72
notes for two days

185.28 --> 188.72
oh well uh

193.68 --> 201.92000000000002
but anyway i went to bed

198.239 --> 205.68
uh before three o'clock

201.92 --> 205.67999999999998
so i had a pretty good night rest

205.92 --> 210.83999999999997
and now i'm only five minutes late

208.0 --> 213.36
instead of 10.

210.84 --> 216.72
woohoo maybe if i go to bed

213.36 --> 219.519
at one o'clock i'll be exactly on time

216.72 --> 219.519
i don't know just

223.04 --> 233.12
ah man

227.04 --> 233.12
uh but yeah spent some time

233.599 --> 237.11999999999998
a lot of time actually watching babylon

235.84 --> 242.31900000000002
5 again

237.12 --> 242.31900000000002
i'm deep into season 4. uh

246.08 --> 250.0
i think that's most of it spent a lot of

248.64 --> 252.83999999999997
time doing that and

250.0 --> 255.84
then did some other things when was it

252.84 --> 255.84
again

268.32 --> 272.56
no no except for just hanging around in

271.759 --> 275.91900000000004
shadow for

272.56 --> 279.199
flat earth debates premieres

275.919 --> 282.639
no i don't think i did a lot so it was

279.199 --> 285.84000000000003
relatively uneventful day

282.639 --> 285.84000000000003
that's nice and calm

286.4 --> 291.67999999999995
have i watched the mandalorian yeah i

288.32 --> 293.68
watched it some time ago

291.68 --> 297.84000000000003
haven't watched any yeah damn night

293.68 --> 297.84000000000003
watch i know

300.08 --> 304.8
it's also just this the whole garaboli

302.8 --> 308.24
plot is really

304.8 --> 310.72
odd in its own way it's

308.24 --> 312.0
it is very mysterious and lasts very

310.72 --> 313.68
long

312.0 --> 316.88
i remember that there's a whole like

313.68 --> 319.759
trick set up eventually

316.88 --> 320.8
but it lasts so long before you even get

319.759 --> 324.32
a direct hint

320.8 --> 327.759
from it like they really

324.32 --> 330.88
put his character arc like

327.759 --> 332.0
going down into shadow well not the

330.88 --> 335.039
shadows

332.0 --> 335.919
but just into like distrust and all that

335.039 --> 338.71999999999997
and negativity

335.919 --> 340.639
safari syndrome that's really what stood

338.72 --> 343.6
out i guess is that

340.639 --> 344.0
the way they portray his character arc

343.6 --> 347.6
he

344.0 --> 351.28
he gets savonia syndrome

347.6 --> 353.44
sort of although lighter

351.28 --> 356.15999999999997
because he just starts to see negative

353.44 --> 356.16
things in

356.8 --> 362.24
in what the leader of the series pretty

360.0 --> 362.24
much

364.479 --> 367.84
what he's going through and he does go

366.639 --> 370.96000000000004
through some

367.84 --> 374.15999999999997
sort of dubious thing it's just it's

370.96 --> 374.71999999999997
very interesting character development

374.16 --> 380.16
that's

374.72 --> 382.319
not seen that often

380.16 --> 385.199
so it just yeah it's interesting to

382.319 --> 385.199
watch it all again

386.319 --> 391.03900000000004
but yeah mandalorian yeah

391.759 --> 396.24
it's a whole different category of

393.759 --> 396.24
series

396.479 --> 402.31899999999996
but yeah i thought that it did had a lot

398.639 --> 402.319
of beautiful visuals at least

402.8 --> 406.8
so mandalorian is very picturesque

405.44 --> 409.84
series

406.8 --> 412.88
but not as

409.84 --> 416.08
story rich

412.88 --> 416.08
as babylon 5.

416.96 --> 423.84
all right tomanoid

425.919 --> 428.24
3

432.24 --> 437.44
increased paranoia increased question of

434.24 --> 440.08
authority sounds familiar yes

437.44 --> 441.599
but also bad decision making because of

440.08 --> 444.31899999999996
it

441.599 --> 447.28
basically going towards other dubious

444.319 --> 450.40000000000003
parties that he knows less of

447.28 --> 452.15999999999997
he gets seduced into opposing as it were

450.4 --> 453.52
that or at least that's how they make it

452.16 --> 456.0
look because

453.52 --> 457.19899999999996
it yeah it's just like halfway unrolling

456.0 --> 459.759
it lasts very long

457.199 --> 460.40000000000003
that that specific arc i remember i

459.759 --> 462.47900000000004
don't

460.4 --> 463.67999999999995
funny is i remember that's that that

462.479 --> 465.84
that's gonna happen

463.68 --> 467.84000000000003
i just don't remember all the details

465.84 --> 470.31899999999996
anymore and that's actually kind of fun

467.84 --> 470.31899999999996
like that

471.28 --> 476.84
because i know something's gonna happen

473.039 --> 479.84
it's just i don't remember exactly how

476.84 --> 479.84
anymore

482.4 --> 486.4
right but it's especially look so funny

485.199 --> 489.91900000000004
syndrome is not as

486.4 --> 491.35999999999996
not primarily about being paranoid and

489.919 --> 493.68
suspicious

491.36 --> 494.639
or worrying a lot about can you trust

493.68 --> 498.08
this person

494.639 --> 498.96000000000004
it's also that it becomes so in the

498.08 --> 501.68
forefront

498.96 --> 506.71999999999997
that you just make bad decisions it's

501.68 --> 508.8
the bad decision part

506.72 --> 510.879
and moving into that that really makes

508.8 --> 513.2
the safari syndrome because a whole lot

510.879 --> 516.5600000000001
of people are paranoid but they don't

513.2 --> 516.5600000000001
necessarily act on it

516.959 --> 522.8
my own way i am one of those people

520.56 --> 524.56
i try not to feed the paranoia as much

522.8 --> 526.959
as possible it's a big problem in its

524.56 --> 529.04
own way

526.959 --> 530.0799999999999
but i yeah i think i've managed to deal

529.04 --> 533.4399999999999
with it

530.08 --> 535.839
very well over the years because it

533.44 --> 538.5600000000001
started out pretty bad i can tell you

535.839 --> 541.44
anyway hey here we go again and samson

538.56 --> 541.4399999999999
good to see you too

546.839 --> 549.839
uh

551.92 --> 555.1999999999999
also i'm starting to notice there is a

553.839 --> 557.0400000000001
whole

555.2 --> 558.8000000000001
bunch of baller trolls from the

557.04 --> 559.8389999999999
netherlands also because i'm getting

558.8 --> 562.399
more

559.839 --> 564.1600000000001
dutch baller comments that are really

562.399 --> 567.12
annoying

564.16 --> 576.8
that's something that stood out to me

567.12 --> 579.68
hello dean right

576.8 --> 582.64
so i think i am being like despite me

579.68 --> 582.64
doing english

583.2 --> 588.1600000000001
i am being noticed by more people in the

585.279 --> 588.16
netherlands i think

589.2 --> 594.5600000000001
which i think yeah i am kind of happy

591.839 --> 597.12
about that because

594.56 --> 605.8389999999999
at some point i do want to focus more on

597.12 --> 605.839
my country since i live here

607.44 --> 611.44
hey zack sterling good to see you again

615.95 --> 619.839
[Music]

617.519 --> 619.839
all right

632.959 --> 638.0
ah i feel a little weird though but i

635.6 --> 641.6800000000001
know already why it's because i went bit

638.0 --> 644.16
overkill on licorice uh

641.68 --> 646.0
especially salty stuff i just had this

644.16 --> 647.76
big earth yesterday so i got some of

646.0 --> 650.959
that but i ate way too much

647.76 --> 652.56
this is like saturated with salt i just

650.959 --> 653.3599999999999
have these moments i already explained

652.56 --> 656.64
that

653.36 --> 658.72
some time ago every now and then

656.64 --> 661.279
just have to do that for some reason but

658.72 --> 663.839
yeah i do always feel it the next day

661.279 --> 666.079
thankfully i it's not even bothered my

663.839 --> 668.399
kidneys as much

666.079 --> 670.16
which is also interesting because yeah i

668.399 --> 673.519
am eating a lot of salt

670.16 --> 676.24
in the past when i did that it did

673.519 --> 679.04
bother my kid i could literally feel it

676.24 --> 679.6800000000001
like burdening them now i did it it

679.04 --> 682.8
doesn't

679.68 --> 685.8389999999999
really seem to burden it which

682.8 --> 688.0
makes me very happy

685.839 --> 689.839
and it's a kind of it's weird because

688.0 --> 690.48
like uh it's supposed to be the other

689.839 --> 693.2
way around

690.48 --> 694.399
over time right well no i guess not i

693.2 --> 697.6
guess that

694.399 --> 703.2
the way i've eaten over the decades

697.6 --> 706.16
makes a big difference for that

703.2 --> 706.5600000000001
my ex-wife used to crave salt once a

706.16 --> 710.399
month

706.56 --> 710.399
okay yeah that's

710.8 --> 716.7199999999999
all right i've always seen it as just a

714.56 --> 720.16
dutch thing

716.72 --> 721.519
because it is typical salt licorice is

720.16 --> 724.639
very dutch

721.519 --> 731.839
other country people from other country

724.639 --> 731.839
almost all of them think it's very weird

734.72 --> 738.0
necessary diet yeah but it's not like i

737.2 --> 740.5600000000001
don't eat

738.0 --> 741.519
enough salt in my regular meals i use a

740.56 --> 744.7199999999999
lot of

741.519 --> 747.2
himalayan salt

744.72 --> 748.0790000000001
so i use plenty of salt but this is just

747.2 --> 751.76
like extra

748.079 --> 755.519
i just get these yeah

751.76 --> 758.48
sodium chloride type candy

755.519 --> 759.36
it's just a lot of salt with with some

758.48 --> 761.279
licorice

759.36 --> 762.9590000000001
you know usually it's the other way

761.279 --> 763.8389999999999
around it's more licorice with a little

762.959 --> 767.1199999999999
salt but this

763.839 --> 770.48
case it's like really hard chorus

767.12 --> 772.24
and other people a lot of people

770.48 --> 774.0
out there really think that's like

772.24 --> 775.6
poison why do you eat that it's just

774.0 --> 778.079
pure salt that's crazy

775.6 --> 780.48
it's not even necessarily a good type of

778.079 --> 784.4799999999999
salt and i agree with that

780.48 --> 786.0790000000001
but yeah i just i don't continually eat

784.48 --> 786.72
it but sometimes i have just this

786.079 --> 790.079
craving

786.72 --> 792.32
and can even pinpoint

790.079 --> 794.2399999999999
if there's like a an oscillation in it

792.32 --> 795.6800000000001
that there's specific time period no

794.24 --> 799.36
it's just

795.68 --> 799.3599999999999
kind of randomly pops up

799.44 --> 806.5600000000001
usually it pops up like in

802.959 --> 808.3199999999999
transitions so i guess in this case it

806.56 --> 810.8
was after christmas dinner

808.32 --> 812.1600000000001
after social confrontation maybe maybe

810.8 --> 815.279
that is something to do with it

812.16 --> 816.24
after social confrontations that i then

815.279 --> 818.24
start to crave for

816.24 --> 820.48
i don't know i'd have to look out for

818.24 --> 822.88
that the next time it happens if

820.48 --> 823.9200000000001
something stands out i haven't really

822.88 --> 827.36
figured out like

823.92 --> 829.8389999999999
why just know that i do every now and

827.36 --> 829.839
then

831.839 --> 837.12
emily and soulful

834.88 --> 837.12
no

839.519 --> 844.639
george sanford no

846.399 --> 854.88
and besides i've been eating that stuff

849.76 --> 858.0
from the organic store for over a decade

854.88 --> 870.079
so whatever's in there it's not

858.0 --> 872.399
harming me can tell you as much

870.079 --> 874.6389999999999
it's very cute that you think it's in

872.399 --> 874.639
there

874.88 --> 885.8389999999999
the himalayan sea salt i eat

878.079 --> 885.8389999999999
does not have it

886.079 --> 890.8
there must there are undoubt no doubt a

888.72 --> 893.0400000000001
lot of traces of a lot of things in

890.8 --> 893.04
there

894.079 --> 901.68
unrefined no it is refined

898.24 --> 903.92
they it's not like super refined

901.68 --> 906.079
concentrated salt they leave the

903.92 --> 906.88
minerals in but they definitely get all

906.079 --> 910.2399999999999
the

906.88 --> 911.279
bad toxins out of that doesn't make any

910.24 --> 913.44
sense like

911.279 --> 914.88
do you think these things through before

913.44 --> 917.839
you say that

914.88 --> 918.639
this is all just nonsense rumors it's

917.839 --> 922.24
just like oh

918.639 --> 927.839
organic food's not really organic

922.24 --> 927.839
it's nonsense

930.7 --> 933.759
[Music]

935.04 --> 938.8
and even if you just look at it at the

937.759 --> 941.6800000000001
salt

938.8 --> 944.24
as it is being sold yes of course it's

941.68 --> 944.2399999999999
refined

948.0 --> 951.44
or at least yeah they have to test it

950.399 --> 956.56
they don't just

951.44 --> 956.5600000000001
scoop something random without testing

966.839 --> 969.839
anything

974.32 --> 983.839
hey robin stanley good to see you

999.44 --> 1003.6
so yeah how was your sunday

1005.759 --> 1011.839
anything interesting you guys girls

1008.88 --> 1011.8389999999999
would like to share

1012.48 --> 1019.12
any streams i missed probably a lot

1017.199 --> 1020.24
i also noticed yesterday that when i

1019.12 --> 1023.519
went live that

1020.24 --> 1025.839
dell also went live it was a weird weird

1023.519 --> 1025.839
timing

1029.36 --> 1036.24
i rarely see him go live in in daytime

1033.839 --> 1039.839
but i didn't check out what it was of

1036.24 --> 1039.839
course because i was doing my show

1041.38 --> 1045.38
[Music]

1056.559 --> 1060.32
oh yeah yeah right uh well good to hear

1058.799 --> 1062.559
that here we go again

1060.32 --> 1064.32
that you're feeling better resting is

1062.559 --> 1066.24
always important

1064.32 --> 1068.32
yeah tara i didn't watch your video

1066.24 --> 1072.0
about the carl sagan one

1068.32 --> 1072.0
it's pretty good it's interesting

1072.96 --> 1078.88
because i think that

1076.24 --> 1079.28
like one of those speeches that you cut

1078.88 --> 1082.96
down

1079.28 --> 1086.0
i think i watched that live on the tele

1082.96 --> 1090.32
or sword alive on the television

1086.0 --> 1091.2
around that time just like in the 90s i

1090.32 --> 1093.9189999999999
think

1091.2 --> 1095.28
but back then i just wasn't interested

1093.919 --> 1098.0
like what

1095.28 --> 1099.44
i back then i was like why the hell is

1098.0 --> 1102.48
this guy talking about

1099.44 --> 1105.28
geocentrism that makes no damn sense

1102.48 --> 1107.2
of course it's not geocentric you know

1105.28 --> 1108.0
that was my mindset back then so that

1107.2 --> 1110.88
kind of made me

1108.0 --> 1110.88
disinterested

1115.039 --> 1118.08
94 right

1119.36 --> 1127.52
it's funny to see it back again and now

1123.6 --> 1127.52
from another perspective understand

1127.57 --> 1130.6899999999998
[Music]

1133.12 --> 1137.1999999999998
necessarily believe the heliocentric

1135.28 --> 1141.12
mystery religion

1137.2 --> 1141.1200000000001
which i very much did back then

1147.919 --> 1152.48
and it is also kind of weird in a way

1149.919 --> 1156.5590000000002
because i remember that originally i

1152.48 --> 1158.0
i just liked heliocentrism and the idea

1156.559 --> 1160.6399999999999
of space so much

1158.0 --> 1162.72
that i became a fan of it first didn't

1160.64 --> 1165.8400000000001
really even start out necessarily

1162.72 --> 1165.84
believing it

1166.64 --> 1170.88
but as i just dug in there for a long

1170.08 --> 1174.08
time

1170.88 --> 1176.7990000000002
had it on my mind a lot eventually i

1174.08 --> 1178.72
i did start to like really believe it or

1176.799 --> 1180.48
rather i got so used to it that i

1178.72 --> 1182.0
couldn't let it go anymore and then my

1180.48 --> 1186.0
mind would kind of

1182.0 --> 1192.0
tweak it into like this is normal

1186.0 --> 1194.24
it's funny how that works

1192.0 --> 1196.24
think that by the way typically does

1194.24 --> 1199.039
happen to young people

1196.24 --> 1200.08
when they really get into something they

1199.039 --> 1203.12
normalize it

1200.08 --> 1207.84
much with much more impact

1203.12 --> 1207.84
to themselves without even realizing it

1208.08 --> 1211.76
and that definitely happened to me too

1219.2 --> 1222.159
a perfection

1232.48 --> 1235.6
yeah you guys were at it in the chat

1234.799 --> 1238.0
yesterday

1235.6 --> 1240.3999999999999
it fled there was a lot of trolls that

1238.0 --> 1243.6
were really trying to bait you

1240.4 --> 1246.159
and i got a bit cranky about it

1243.6 --> 1247.4399999999998
it's like come on they are obviously

1246.159 --> 1249.5200000000002
baiting you you shouldn't

1247.44 --> 1251.1200000000001
even like respond back to that level

1249.52 --> 1253.56
because

1251.12 --> 1256.08
it just makes them happy

1253.56 --> 1259.6789999999999
[Music]

1256.08 --> 1262.0
so yeah i hope you don't mind

1259.679 --> 1262.799
sometimes i feel like it's not literally

1262.0 --> 1266.159
my business

1262.799 --> 1269.84
but i guess habits carry across

1266.159 --> 1271.7600000000002
because i do absolutely uphold that sort

1269.84 --> 1274.9599999999998
of policy in here but yeah

1271.76 --> 1276.72
it's like because it's you guys i feel

1274.96 --> 1280.48
like my responsibilities

1276.72 --> 1283.28
sort of as a teacher lie beyond just

1280.48 --> 1283.28
this hangout

1283.36 --> 1286.4799999999998
i don't know what you guys think about

1284.96 --> 1288.96
that but i am

1286.48 --> 1289.6
always trying to point out just like

1288.96 --> 1292.88
look

1289.6 --> 1295.12
you should do better you could do better

1292.88 --> 1296.72
do you realize what you're doing but i

1295.12 --> 1300.1589999999999
guess it's also a bit

1296.72 --> 1302.64
feels like meddling sometimes because

1300.159 --> 1303.6000000000001
you all do that because you feel a need

1302.64 --> 1306.4
for it

1303.6 --> 1309.1999999999998
you feel a need for like a a slapping

1306.4 --> 1312.24
fight with the troll

1309.2 --> 1314.0800000000002
i'm just trying to point out as others

1312.24 --> 1316.4
have pointed out to me in the past it's

1314.08 --> 1318.3999999999999
like it's not very good doing that

1316.4 --> 1320.72
you shouldn't even be wanting that but

1318.4 --> 1323.039
yeah when you want it it's like

1320.72 --> 1325.2
what it this is my business if i want to

1323.039 --> 1327.36
do that i'm going to do that

1325.2 --> 1327.3600000000001
so

1328.799 --> 1334.32
but yeah now that i personally stepped

1332.64 --> 1336.4
away from that sort of thing

1334.32 --> 1338.3999999999999
more and more although i do sometimes

1336.4 --> 1340.3200000000002
lash out all of a sudden but i

1338.4 --> 1341.6000000000001
never keep it long i always step away

1340.32 --> 1343.6
eventually

1341.6 --> 1347.1999999999998
espec yeah when i first figure out like

1343.6 --> 1349.1999999999998
yeah this is not going anywhere

1347.2 --> 1351.3600000000001
and you can't always leave the winning

1349.2 --> 1353.52
comment because trolls

1351.36 --> 1355.52
have no life and they will always have

1353.52 --> 1357.28
the last word always

1355.52 --> 1360.6399999999999
and that's something i kind of learned

1357.28 --> 1364.1589999999999
with with the guys

1360.64 --> 1366.4
i think yeah nathan oakley mostly

1364.159 --> 1367.7600000000002
it's like yeah trolls will always win in

1366.4 --> 1369.8400000000001
their mind

1367.76 --> 1370.96
or in the chat unless you just ban them

1369.84 --> 1372.6399999999999
or something

1370.96 --> 1374.0
but they'll still win in their mind so

1372.64 --> 1378.5590000000002
you you gotta just

1374.0 --> 1381.44
lay down to the fact that you can never

1378.559 --> 1381.44
win from a troll

1382.799 --> 1393.2
jesus damn fireworks

1389.679 --> 1394.5590000000002
just for five more days and

1393.2 --> 1403.8400000000001
finally there's going to be some peace

1394.559 --> 1403.84
and quiet out there

1407.84 --> 1412.1589999999999
yeah perfection that's correct lots of

1410.159 --> 1412.96
trolls but you guys were all troll

1412.159 --> 1416.159
baiting like

1412.96 --> 1419.28
maniacs i could see

1416.159 --> 1420.96
their vernacular echoing in what you

1419.28 --> 1424.32
were saying

1420.96 --> 1426.799
and yeah a lot of you you know what you

1424.32 --> 1426.799
were doing

1427.44 --> 1431.679
and i tried to sort of correct it and i

1430.0 --> 1432.64
kicked a whole lot of these trolls out

1431.679 --> 1435.679
because i've already

1432.64 --> 1438.7990000000002
identified them as trolls and like

1435.679 --> 1441.2
i typically do let trolls hang around

1438.799 --> 1442.32
unless they go too far and i did feel

1441.2 --> 1444.4
like they were pushing

1442.32 --> 1446.8799999999999
that border all of them together so i

1444.4 --> 1448.799
just started kicking them

1446.88 --> 1450.3200000000002
start to call people perverts and all

1448.799 --> 1452.559
that that is just

1450.32 --> 1454.24
that is nonsensical has no relation to

1452.559 --> 1458.3999999999999
the flat earth

1454.24 --> 1460.48
debates and then yeah

1458.4 --> 1462.159
especially if they draw other people in

1460.48 --> 1465.919
with that sort of accusation

1462.159 --> 1465.919
then it's just time to kick it out

1471.44 --> 1474.4
rocket launch what

1475.12 --> 1488.7199999999998
what are you talking about david

1486.159 --> 1488.72
is that

1495.76 --> 1499.279
right but look perfection when you do

1498.88 --> 1501.279
that

1499.279 --> 1503.52
you may consider it as like a fishing

1501.279 --> 1504.48
sport but you are effectively troll

1503.52 --> 1506.48
waiting

1504.48 --> 1508.88
and when you do that it makes more

1506.48 --> 1510.96
trolls come

1508.88 --> 1512.72
it does because you're making them

1510.96 --> 1516.0
squirt and when they squirt

1512.72 --> 1519.2
they come back for more you see

1516.0 --> 1519.2
it's called troll baiting

1526.84 --> 1533.1999999999998
and it is of course nathan oakley's chat

1531.039 --> 1535.44
i don't exactly know what he wants with

1533.2 --> 1537.52
it or even if he cares but it's always

1535.44 --> 1539.8400000000001
been kind of like a free room where

1537.52 --> 1542.72
even trolls can just basically share

1539.84 --> 1546.0
their pain right

1542.72 --> 1546.0
but i'd prefer that

1546.88 --> 1554.64
that would be narrowed down to

1550.32 --> 1555.6
like real heliocentris like real

1554.64 --> 1557.6000000000001
believers

1555.6 --> 1559.52
that can share their pain because hey if

1557.6 --> 1560.6399999999999
you pay attention you can make out who

1559.52 --> 1562.6399999999999
those are

1560.64 --> 1564.4
versus people that are specifically

1562.64 --> 1566.7990000000002
there to nag

1564.4 --> 1569.279
flat earthers in chat because it's

1566.799 --> 1572.48
another category it feels different they

1569.279 --> 1572.48
do things differently

1575.6 --> 1581.84
and yeah heliocentrist believers in chat

1580.08 --> 1584.08
just saying oh so stupid planet earth

1581.84 --> 1589.36
this are stupid it's

1584.08 --> 1590.96
funnier it's less annoying i think

1589.36 --> 1593.4399999999998
but i don't know what you guys think

1590.96 --> 1593.44
about that

1596.96 --> 1600.159
because trolls that are just there to

1599.12 --> 1602.7199999999998
nag people

1600.159 --> 1605.679
they don't really care so they give up

1602.72 --> 1605.679
of a flare

1606.0 --> 1610.08
like they're just there to nag and not

1608.48 --> 1612.159
really

1610.08 --> 1614.48
go through a personal process in

1612.159 --> 1615.5200000000002
relation to flat earth and heliocentrism

1614.48 --> 1617.52
you see

1615.52 --> 1620.1589999999999
because it radiates something different

1617.52 --> 1620.1589999999999
there's something

1620.559 --> 1624.8799999999999
that touches the soul and that leaks out

1623.12 --> 1627.6789999999999
into how you do things how you say

1624.88 --> 1629.679
things

1627.679 --> 1630.799
the direction that carries you in the

1629.679 --> 1634.24
conversation

1630.799 --> 1634.24
in your social interactions

1634.559 --> 1641.84
but they always lose well real trolls

1637.279 --> 1641.84
never lose

1643.52 --> 1648.48
because they're trolls and of course

1646.24 --> 1651.2
helios interests are just sharing their

1648.48 --> 1655.039
pain and frustration

1651.2 --> 1656.96
because they kind of feel they might not

1655.039 --> 1657.36
consciously even have figured it out but

1656.96 --> 1659.3600000000001
they

1657.36 --> 1661.52
kind of feel in reflection to what's

1659.36 --> 1663.12
said in flat earth debates that they

1661.52 --> 1664.32
have lost

1663.12 --> 1669.84
so of course they're going to share

1664.32 --> 1669.84
their pain as nathan says it

1673.99 --> 1677.13
[Music]

1684.159 --> 1697.8400000000001
yes i know perfection

1699.6 --> 1702.73
[Music]

1713.6 --> 1718.399
personally i would just ban all trolls

1715.84 --> 1720.6399999999999
well in the flat earth debates

1718.399 --> 1725.84
that would become a very quiet chat if

1720.64 --> 1725.8400000000001
that were the case

1732.88 --> 1736.159
you know with the troll before you can

1734.88 --> 1738.0
actually bend them

1736.159 --> 1741.1200000000001
and be sure that they are true it always

1738.0 --> 1741.12
takes some figuring out

1741.279 --> 1748.08
because a drained troll sneaks in

1745.6 --> 1749.76
in a way that you're not really sure

1748.08 --> 1750.799
i've started to notice that even with

1749.76 --> 1754.399
the trolls that come

1750.799 --> 1757.039
in here in this chat hey nathan oakley

1754.399 --> 1757.039
9080

1758.799 --> 1762.399
right members only can be very quiet but

1760.72 --> 1764.48
that's only during the live streams

1762.399 --> 1781.84
though

1764.48 --> 1781.84
in premieres is never members only

1782.93 --> 1786.009
[Music]

1792.84 --> 1798.8799999999999
okay

1795.039 --> 1801.12
okay nathan skye

1798.88 --> 1801.1200000000001
what

1803.52 --> 1809.84
a drawing of what is it

1811.279 --> 1823.84
a starry sky

1827.679 --> 1832.0800000000002
oh my god i refreshed my page and got an

1830.399 --> 1834.6399999999999
ad

1832.08 --> 1834.6399999999999
for like

1835.44 --> 1841.8400000000001
that i i that just flustered me

1838.64 --> 1846.0800000000002
this is what the [ __ ] was that

1841.84 --> 1848.399
so bears something to do with bears

1846.08 --> 1850.799
but it was like the gay version

1848.399 --> 1853.52
obviously according to it wasn't like

1850.799 --> 1856.0
bears from own benjamin bears like what

1853.52 --> 1856.0
the [ __ ]

1859.519 --> 1866.0
it was aimed at the gay bears

1864.0 --> 1867.44
something to do with some programming

1866.0 --> 1871.679
thing or whatever

1867.44 --> 1876.0800000000002
social media i don't know what the [ __ ]

1871.679 --> 1880.48
that flustered me uh

1876.08 --> 1880.48
i was asked what was up arwen

1881.039 --> 1893.84
oh sky vacuum right of course of course

1883.679 --> 1893.8400000000001
that's what that meant

1896.799 --> 1907.84
except in australia what

1919.36 --> 1923.84
still waiting hashtag make it happen

1921.72 --> 1926.72
1286.

1923.84 --> 1926.72
which one was that

1931.039 --> 1939.36
stars i think are lesser beings what

1935.519 --> 1942.48
beings you say a being has to

1939.36 --> 1946.1589999999999
be so are they

1942.48 --> 1948.3990000000001
are they things in places

1946.159 --> 1950.7990000000002
it's kind of a weird train of

1948.399 --> 1953.84
reification there

1950.799 --> 1957.12
because i think stars are lights

1953.84 --> 1960.799
and that's the only thing they are but

1957.12 --> 1962.8799999999999
i don't know there's a lot of myths

1960.799 --> 1964.1589999999999
about the stars even reaching into

1962.88 --> 1967.919
ancient times so

1964.159 --> 1970.96
yeah reification

1967.919 --> 1973.2
of stars or anthropomorphization of

1970.96 --> 1974.88
stars and heavenly bodies has been

1973.2 --> 1977.8400000000001
happening

1974.88 --> 1980.0800000000002
throughout human history probably since

1977.84 --> 1991.84
the beginning since they first

1980.08 --> 1991.84
were noticed

1992.96 --> 1998.159
you've been reading angelic

1999.36 --> 2005.84
yeah that's just that's reification

2009.12 --> 2012.559
although yeah what is angelic who knows

2011.76 --> 2014.72
man there's

2012.559 --> 2018.399
there's frequency things there's

2014.72 --> 2019.1200000000001
influences astrology is a thing so it's

2018.399 --> 2022.0
not

2019.12 --> 2024.6399999999999
just lights there's also some kind of

2022.0 --> 2027.84
influence but i don't exactly know

2024.64 --> 2030.3200000000002
whether it is simply about the overall

2027.84 --> 2034.24
periodic energies of the realm

2030.32 --> 2036.32
and that the sky clock basically

2034.24 --> 2038.96
gives some kind of rhythm to it or

2036.32 --> 2042.72
whether it has to do with the specific

2038.96 --> 2044.72
light point

2042.72 --> 2046.64
like from a star from a planet or

2044.72 --> 2048.96
whatever that has the influence it's

2046.64 --> 2048.96
weird

2049.2 --> 2054.3199999999997
but there is something to astrology like

2052.079 --> 2054.32
that

2058.48 --> 2062.72
it's going to be yeah very very

2060.96 --> 2064.96
difficult to prove

2062.72 --> 2064.9599999999996
though

2066.879 --> 2071.5989999999997
scientifically that is probably

2072.839 --> 2075.839
impossible

2087.44 --> 2093.2000000000003
oh yeah perfection that video

2090.72 --> 2095.04
like good guys just go down go boom it's

2093.2 --> 2099.1189999999997
just

2095.04 --> 2099.119
these trolls they think it's funny

2100.16 --> 2104.0789999999997
because they just don't get it they just

2102.56 --> 2105.68
think they're just trying to make it

2104.079 --> 2109.119
look stupid

2105.68 --> 2111.52
when it's actually them

2109.119 --> 2112.32
nathan makes fun of and they just they

2111.52 --> 2115.7599999999998
think it

2112.32 --> 2116.88
they don't get it those videos are

2115.76 --> 2118.5600000000004
always weird

2116.88 --> 2121.119
it's just people that just look to the

2118.56 --> 2123.2
surface don't listen to the arguments

2121.119 --> 2124.88
just listen to how it sounds on the

2123.2 --> 2127.68
surface and then they think it's so

2124.88 --> 2130.96
funny it's so funny look at this oh

2127.68 --> 2134.64
look at the crazy faces

2130.96 --> 2137.76
that they pick out of the hole

2134.64 --> 2139.839
and then uh so funny but it's just

2137.76 --> 2140.96
when somebody watches that and actually

2139.839 --> 2144.48
gets it they just

2140.96 --> 2147.44
instantly know like oh this is just a

2144.48 --> 2159.839
an idiot who doesn't understand what is

2147.44 --> 2159.839
even addressed

2170.839 --> 2173.839
spurs

2176.0 --> 2180.0
came up in recommendations well why

2178.72 --> 2182.56
would that be

2180.0 --> 2183.359
could it be because you are troll

2182.56 --> 2185.96
baiting

2183.359 --> 2187.2799999999997
so youtube starts to give you

2185.96 --> 2190.64
recommendations

2187.28 --> 2195.44
for troll videos because i never

2190.64 --> 2197.2
get any videos like that recommended

2195.44 --> 2200.4
even though when i search on it yeah

2197.2 --> 2201.52
there's like 20 different who are when

2200.4 --> 2204.0
is insane or

2201.52 --> 2207.7599999999998
stupid or disgusting or something or

2204.0 --> 2207.76
psychopath whatever video

2208.96 --> 2212.88
there's a lot out of them but they never

2210.64 --> 2215.68
get recommended to me because i don't

2212.88 --> 2216.48
troll bait i literally ignore it it's

2215.68 --> 2220.0789999999997
like oh

2216.48 --> 2220.8
okay that person has some personal issue

2220.079 --> 2222.4
and

2220.8 --> 2224.96
they need to share that with the world

2222.4 --> 2224.96
apparently

2226.4 --> 2232.0
and besides if yeah if people

2229.52 --> 2233.599
actually click on something like that

2232.0 --> 2235.839
then they either

2233.599 --> 2237.04
just get repulsed and then step away and

2235.839 --> 2239.2799999999997
then oh they may

2237.04 --> 2240.16
on the surface have a very superficial

2239.28 --> 2243.2000000000003
like oh

2240.16 --> 2246.24
bad man when they see me right but

2243.2 --> 2249.5989999999997
as soon as i then notice that address it

2246.24 --> 2252.16
i'll snap them out of it really quickly

2249.599 --> 2255.76
because there is a lot more to what i do

2252.16 --> 2257.5989999999997
in way i compose myself

2255.76 --> 2259.2000000000003
so i'm not worried about that but

2257.599 --> 2262.2400000000002
besides those people

2259.2 --> 2264.24
the ones that will actually watch that

2262.24 --> 2268.3999999999996
they're gonna be curious like who is

2264.24 --> 2271.9199999999996
this arwin guy why is he so pissed off

2268.4 --> 2274.0
why him what's so special about this

2271.92 --> 2277.599
and they'll just look it up and see oh

2274.0 --> 2277.599
what the [ __ ] this guy has like

2277.68 --> 2284.56
yeah close to a thousand live shows

2281.359 --> 2288.56
so yeah if those trolls

2284.56 --> 2291.2
hadn't done that then there will be less

2288.56 --> 2293.599
people that will take notice of me

2291.2 --> 2296.0
and hey most people already know there's

2293.599 --> 2296.96
a lot of [ __ ] on the internet so if they

2296.0 --> 2299.52
bump into a

2296.96 --> 2300.32
stupid troll video like that it's not

2299.52 --> 2303.2
like oh

2300.32 --> 2304.32
oh my god who could have thought no

2303.2 --> 2305.839
they're not gonna fall for that

2304.32 --> 2306.1600000000003
immediately because they already know

2305.839 --> 2309.2799999999997
yeah

2306.16 --> 2311.359
internet is full of trolly [ __ ]

2309.28 --> 2313.92
so it's only gonna give them a hint as

2311.359 --> 2317.44
to that there is a person out there that

2313.92 --> 2317.44
apparently triggered this person

2318.079 --> 2323.599
so yeah i don't really mind that much

2321.76 --> 2325.2000000000003
i just start to mind when they copy

2323.599 --> 2328.48
entire shows

2325.2 --> 2330.8799999999997
and recently i had to basically i got a

2328.48 --> 2332.0
notification for a copyright situation

2330.88 --> 2336.2400000000002
where somebody just

2332.0 --> 2336.64
copied an entire show and yeah i did

2336.24 --> 2339.7599999999998
give

2336.64 --> 2340.96
yeah i did have it removed because

2339.76 --> 2342.7200000000003
that's just stupid

2340.96 --> 2344.48
somebody wants to talk about me or make

2342.72 --> 2348.48
silly clips that's one thing but

2344.48 --> 2348.48
you're not just gonna copy my show

2352.4 --> 2355.839
hey my god

2357.76 --> 2361.0400000000004
no zack sterling

2364.33 --> 2369.92
[Music]

2367.44 --> 2370.88
yeah also i'd like to remind newcomers

2369.92 --> 2374.88
here

2370.88 --> 2378.7200000000003
might not like it but mind of god is

2374.88 --> 2378.7200000000003
like on probation here

2378.8 --> 2383.119
i've given him another chance because in

2380.88 --> 2386.56
the past he's really misbehaved

2383.119 --> 2392.1600000000003
really badly so

2386.56 --> 2392.16
yeah just for the newcomers information

2393.599 --> 2397.6800000000003
like not everybody in this chat is per

2396.8 --> 2400.2400000000002
definition

2397.68 --> 2411.839
a fantastic person you can trust with

2400.24 --> 2411.839
everything okay

2413.68 --> 2417.359
[Music]

2415.68 --> 2419.52
you're always in some kind of doghouse

2417.359 --> 2422.7999999999997
well you that's your own

2419.52 --> 2426.88
fault you went

2422.8 --> 2428.8
completely nuts into savogne mode

2426.88 --> 2430.8
right and yeah you come in peace and i

2428.8 --> 2434.1600000000003
like that i appreciate that

2430.8 --> 2436.7200000000003
but there is a history and as i said i'm

2434.16 --> 2441.04
not going to forget that history

2436.72 --> 2441.04
and in a way i don't fully trust you

2441.28 --> 2445.0400000000004
that's gonna take a long time

2446.4 --> 2453.839
you are east indian are you

2458.079 --> 2461.52
okay i wouldn't have

2462.4 --> 2467.839
we don't it's not my enemy

2466.0 --> 2469.599
if that's the reason you're here you

2467.839 --> 2472.88
should go away because i'm

2469.599 --> 2472.88
he's not my enemy

2476.4 --> 2481.839
like i don't declare war

2482.24 --> 2485.52
not even on people that deserve it

2484.079 --> 2487.44
because

2485.52 --> 2488.88
yeah it's a waste of my energy it

2487.44 --> 2491.119
doesn't work

2488.88 --> 2493.2000000000003
it's not effective it doesn't get

2491.119 --> 2495.92
somebody away

2493.2 --> 2498.7999999999997
it just creates a lot of ruckus

2495.92 --> 2498.8
distracts

2498.88 --> 2509.599
and drains energy on the long run so

2501.599 --> 2511.52
that's why i don't do it

2509.599 --> 2513.6800000000003
but i'll damn well be honest about

2511.52 --> 2514.319
things point out things even if those

2513.68 --> 2518.3999999999996
people

2514.319 --> 2522.24
try to uphold some image or whatever

2518.4 --> 2523.92
because i don't like that i don't like

2522.24 --> 2525.2799999999997
people that are trying to portray

2523.92 --> 2527.92
themselves better than they

2525.28 --> 2530.0
are trying to fool everybody with it and

2527.92 --> 2531.44
manipulate situations i hate that so

2530.0 --> 2533.28
i'll definitely speak out about doesn't

2531.44 --> 2536.079
mean that i'm going in a war oh this

2533.28 --> 2539.44
person is dishonest i'm going to

2536.079 --> 2542.48
get on their ass constantly and

2539.44 --> 2546.319
look there's other people that do that

2542.48 --> 2549.359
for example tony has this tendency a

2546.319 --> 2551.119
sleeping warrior tony

2549.359 --> 2554.48
and yeah you can't really stop him it

2551.119 --> 2557.839
serves its function he likes to do that

2554.48 --> 2565.839
i don't it's not good for me it's not

2557.839 --> 2565.839
really effective just distracting

2576.839 --> 2579.839
so

2585.2 --> 2589.7599999999998
in opposition with yourself uh

2589.92 --> 2593.839
i think what you're trying to say

2598.48 --> 2602.64
sleeping warrior nose gravity yeah he

2600.4 --> 2607.04
knows it doesn't exist

2602.64 --> 2609.359
and so do i he's just more tenacious

2607.04 --> 2612.72
about it

2609.359 --> 2615.04
i am not certain i just figured it out

2612.72 --> 2618.319
i can presuppose on many levels i even

2615.04 --> 2618.319
have modifications

2618.4 --> 2623.44
that i would recommend if somebody gives

2621.599 --> 2625.92
me six million dollars

2623.44 --> 2627.04
or euros but that's probably not gonna

2625.92 --> 2629.28
happen so i'm just gonna

2627.04 --> 2632.079
hold that back and i'll keep holding

2629.28 --> 2635.44
that back and it might never

2632.079 --> 2638.2400000000002
share it and just

2635.44 --> 2639.68
let the heliocentric community just

2638.24 --> 2649.839
stumble

2639.68 --> 2649.839
and make bad decisions and lose it

2655.28 --> 2661.2000000000003
what were we talking about

2661.599 --> 2671.28
uh well mine of god says he's the enemy

2666.8 --> 2671.28
of good servant remember good servant

2674.56 --> 2679.92
who was a friend of mine even came on

2678.079 --> 2681.599
the show a couple of times did his show

2679.92 --> 2685.52
on his

2681.599 --> 2689.2000000000003
show but yeah

2685.52 --> 2689.2
something happened and uh

2689.599 --> 2692.88
yeah i confided in him on a very deep

2692.4 --> 2696.1600000000003
level

2692.88 --> 2698.96
and then he yeah

2696.16 --> 2698.96
betrayed me

2699.2 --> 2706.0
he he recorded some of these moments

2702.88 --> 2708.1600000000003
in secret and he says he's a christian

2706.0 --> 2709.76
and all that it's just

2708.16 --> 2711.2799999999997
and i don't even know what he shared

2709.76 --> 2719.44
about it

2711.28 --> 2721.92
but it's just it's just wrong

2719.44 --> 2723.68
but that doesn't mean he is my enemy it

2721.92 --> 2725.44
just means he betrayed our friendship

2723.68 --> 2730.24
and i can never trust him again

2725.44 --> 2730.2400000000002
because he does not have the sensibility

2730.56 --> 2735.2799999999997
to even know what is right and what is

2733.92 --> 2737.599
wrong apparently

2735.28 --> 2739.76
we would have done something like this

2737.599 --> 2743.52
it would not have

2739.76 --> 2746.3190000000004
deflected my outrage the way he has

2743.52 --> 2747.119
once that became apparent to me saying

2746.319 --> 2750.16
like stop

2747.119 --> 2750.48
this don't do that it's wrong and just

2750.16 --> 2754.48
no

2750.48 --> 2756.2400000000002
no i have i'm special boy i have to do

2754.48 --> 2761.359
this

2756.24 --> 2764.4799999999996
it's like no you're just going nuts and

2761.359 --> 2768.319
yeah you're you're just yeah

2764.48 --> 2774.72
breaking trust for your crazy little

2768.319 --> 2776.64
messiah mission

2774.72 --> 2777.839
your phone conversation with mark

2776.64 --> 2780.56
sergeant

2777.839 --> 2780.56
no i haven't

2787.2 --> 2793.4399999999996
what about it is it interesting

2790.72 --> 2793.4399999999996
is it really

2798.4 --> 2806.64
what's interesting about it

2803.52 --> 2809.839
mark always answers his phone i gotta

2806.64 --> 2809.839
try that out sometime

2812.64 --> 2817.2799999999997
he's always had his phone available from

2815.44 --> 2820.4
since the start for five years it's just

2817.28 --> 2820.4
been a public phone

2823.76 --> 2828.7200000000003
speech about n times in this last

2826.0 --> 2828.72
audiobook

2828.839 --> 2832.72
okay

2830.48 --> 2835.359
a new civilization of aliens being

2832.72 --> 2839.1189999999997
revealed well i wouldn't be surprised

2835.359 --> 2841.04
that they would virtually do this

2839.119 --> 2842.48
there's already whole categories of

2841.04 --> 2845.119
[ __ ] that are just being

2842.48 --> 2846.8
standardized so yeah who knows

2845.119 --> 2849.04
there's going to be like oh there are

2846.8 --> 2851.52
aliens and they

2849.04 --> 2852.64
yeah that there's been preparation for

2851.52 --> 2856.079
that for

2852.64 --> 2858.16
several decades now so maybe mark

2856.079 --> 2861.28
sargent believes in that

2858.16 --> 2863.839
or that it well he should know just like

2861.28 --> 2865.119
i know that it has been a potential plan

2863.839 --> 2866.96
to unroll

2865.119 --> 2873.839
now whether it is actually going to

2866.96 --> 2873.839
unroll is another matter

2882.21 --> 2885.309
[Music]

2889.839 --> 2894.88
propped up shill what the hell are you

2893.28 --> 2897.92
talking about

2894.88 --> 2899.6800000000003
a show for what for flat earth is a

2897.92 --> 2902.64
shield for flat earth can be more

2899.68 --> 2902.96
shill for flat earth it's like what is

2902.64 --> 2906.24
this

2902.96 --> 2906.2400000000002
issue with mark sergeant

2907.839 --> 2911.92
he's straight forward as can be

2912.72 --> 2918.24
he just has this mission for himself

2916.319 --> 2920.48
and how does that make him a chill a

2918.24 --> 2922.16
show for what

2920.48 --> 2923.599
you really think he makes flat earth

2922.16 --> 2926.839
look bad

2923.599 --> 2928.88
compared to other things that are out

2926.839 --> 2931.7599999999998
there

2928.88 --> 2931.76
i don't think so

2931.92 --> 2935.44
he's just got a specific type of

2933.839 --> 2939.52
strategy

2935.44 --> 2941.44
a strategy of yeah it's okay if they try

2939.52 --> 2944.079
to make you look like a fool

2941.44 --> 2945.359
actually play into it but at the same

2944.079 --> 2948.2400000000002
time

2945.359 --> 2949.04
not be a fool be a fool inside not being

2948.24 --> 2951.839
a fool

2949.04 --> 2954.079
and i think he's done that remarkably

2951.839 --> 2954.0789999999997
well

2954.559 --> 2959.0400000000004
and it works it freaking works

2960.64 --> 2967.04
because it spread so far

2964.16 --> 2969.04
and suddenly people know there is a flat

2967.04 --> 2970.8
earth guy called mark sartian out there

2969.04 --> 2972.72
where before it's just oh there

2970.8 --> 2974.2400000000002
are flat earthers you don't know they

2972.72 --> 2976.16
must be stupid blah blah

2974.24 --> 2977.7599999999998
you're not just going to look flat earth

2976.16 --> 2980.3999999999996
there's a whole bunch of

2977.76 --> 2982.7200000000003
actual shield and fake flat earth

2980.4 --> 2985.2000000000003
garbage is then going to pop up

2982.72 --> 2986.7999999999997
now if you suddenly notice hey there is

2985.2 --> 2988.0
a mark sergeant guy that's a flat

2986.8 --> 2990.7200000000003
earther

2988.0 --> 2992.4
he doesn't seem like a outright maniac

2990.72 --> 2994.48
disgusting person

2992.4 --> 2998.079
let's look him up oh guess what an

2994.48 --> 3001.2
actual flat earther yeah it works

2998.079 --> 3002.079
he's a shield for flat earth always has

3001.2 --> 3005.839
been

3002.079 --> 3013.8390000000004
he's very open about it and has

3005.839 --> 3013.839
specific strategies and they work

3014.319 --> 3019.68
oh my god don't even try putting mark

3017.52 --> 3021.68
sergeant and bob in the same category

3019.68 --> 3027.2799999999997
perfection that's just wrong

3021.68 --> 3030.96
that's just wrong

3027.28 --> 3034.3190000000004
like mark sergeant doesn't insert

3030.96 --> 3037.68
pseudoscience [ __ ]

3034.319 --> 3041.119
he sticks to flat earth

3037.68 --> 3044.319
and to the the commonalities in that

3041.119 --> 3048.0
and he also likes to just talk about

3044.319 --> 3051.92
other stuff but he doesn't like

3048.0 --> 3055.119
insert pseudoscience

3051.92 --> 3057.6800000000003
into his official representation of flat

3055.119 --> 3057.6800000000003
earth so

3058.64 --> 3062.319
right there's no such thing as bad

3060.319 --> 3064.4
publicity

3062.319 --> 3065.68
well there is potential for bad

3064.4 --> 3068.88
publicity but

3065.68 --> 3070.5589999999997
every thing that would be seen by one

3068.88 --> 3074.48
side as bad

3070.559 --> 3074.48
can still be utilized

3075.44 --> 3079.599
it doesn't just because it's is seen as

3078.079 --> 3082.079
bad by one group doesn't mean that

3079.599 --> 3082.88
everybody's gonna see it that way and

3082.079 --> 3085.28
there's just

3082.88 --> 3087.839
ways to play into that and mark sergeant

3085.28 --> 3091.2000000000003
has kind of specialized himself

3087.839 --> 3093.839
in that like since the start

3091.2 --> 3095.9199999999996
and he knows because he has a long-term

3093.839 --> 3096.319
experience he was into the gaming world

3095.92 --> 3099.599
well

3096.319 --> 3101.599
there trolling and this sort of strategy

3099.599 --> 3104.88
happens all the time

3101.599 --> 3108.0
so he has experience like mark sargent

3104.88 --> 3110.319
knows what he is doing does it mean he's

3108.0 --> 3113.2
perfect he oh he's not always 100

3110.319 --> 3114.96
in control he's a he's a person he has a

3113.2 --> 3118.0
soul he has

3114.96 --> 3119.119
issues like everybody does especially

3118.0 --> 3122.24
when you

3119.119 --> 3125.44
are on the strain but

3122.24 --> 3130.319
his mechanism his principles have been

3125.44 --> 3132.64
very consistent and he is effective

3130.319 --> 3133.359
i like mark sergeant a lot better than a

3132.64 --> 3136.4
whole other

3133.359 --> 3139.839
bunch of proclaimed

3136.4 --> 3139.839
mainstream flat earthers

3142.12 --> 3145.19
[Music]

3147.92 --> 3151.04
anybody ever got

3151.76 --> 3158.4
yeah well napoleon did your ass

3155.2 --> 3159.5989999999997
yeah there's plenty of pictures of the

3158.4 --> 3163.119
antarctic

3159.599 --> 3166.079
ice wall it's just that

3163.119 --> 3168.96
it's not really too certain what the

3166.079 --> 3170.88
orientation of it is because

3168.96 --> 3172.88
whatever the orientation may be it's a

3170.88 --> 3175.2000000000003
very big freaking wall

3172.88 --> 3176.319
and you can't just by looking past it

3175.2 --> 3179.04
make out oh yeah

3176.319 --> 3180.079
it's an inward arc or oh it's an island

3179.04 --> 3183.359
no it's too

3180.079 --> 3183.3590000000004
big either way

3185.04 --> 3190.16
it may turn out to be just a straight

3186.8 --> 3190.1600000000003
wall right

3190.319 --> 3199.44
you see it yeah me too

3195.359 --> 3199.44
not know who's effectively a baller well

3202.64 --> 3208.8799999999997
not a baller but he wants to use

3206.0 --> 3211.2
the baller strategies he wants to be the

3208.88 --> 3213.28
flat earth nasa

3211.2 --> 3215.839
sort of that sort of angle that's his

3213.28 --> 3216.88
angle and that was very apparent to me

3215.839 --> 3220.16
from the very

3216.88 --> 3223.839
very first start was

3220.16 --> 3223.839
not appreciated

3225.359 --> 3230.0789999999997
but that's what he wants he wants to

3227.76 --> 3237.8390000000004
take over where nasa is going to drop

3230.079 --> 3237.8390000000004
the ball

3252.0 --> 3254.319
sure

3256.48 --> 3265.839
i've said that before

3272.0 --> 3276.4
let's show them that so we can finally

3274.88 --> 3279.76
tell the truth what

3276.4 --> 3281.92
what does that mean napoleon did your

3279.76 --> 3281.92
ass

3284.48 --> 3287.92
what show them pictures of the ice wall

3286.72 --> 3290.319
that is big

3287.92 --> 3292.319
and that you can't make out from it what

3290.319 --> 3296.72
the orientation is and yeah

3292.319 --> 3299.04
how does that give us the ability to

3296.72 --> 3302.319
finally tell the truth

3299.04 --> 3304.48
i don't get it

3302.319 --> 3306.5589999999997
the truth that the earth how does making

3304.48 --> 3309.119
pictures of an ice wall prove the earth

3306.559 --> 3313.3590000000004
is really flat

3309.119 --> 3313.359
that has no relation to that whatsoever

3313.68 --> 3316.72
you don't need to have pictures of an

3315.839 --> 3318.48
ice wall

3316.72 --> 3320.5589999999997
to figure out the earth is flat you just

3318.48 --> 3321.839
need to figure out that there's no

3320.559 --> 3325.28
curvature

3321.839 --> 3328.4
and that horizon does not abide to the

3325.28 --> 3330.7200000000003
geometry that is absolutely required

3328.4 --> 3332.799
if the earth we're standing on were to

3330.72 --> 3335.68
be geometrically a globe of the size

3332.799 --> 3339.839
that they say it is

3335.68 --> 3339.839
and because there are sightings

3340.4 --> 3343.52
that yeah

3344.16 --> 3348.72
that do not abide by those geometric

3347.119 --> 3352.2400000000002
standards

3348.72 --> 3355.359
very low to the surface footage

3352.24 --> 3358.24
of things several kilometers in in the

3355.359 --> 3358.72
in the distance that just proves that

3358.24 --> 3362.72
that

3358.72 --> 3365.2
specific geometry is not present

3362.72 --> 3366.48
because there would have to be certain

3365.2 --> 3369.9199999999996
things out of sight

3366.48 --> 3371.76
obstructed and they're not so you don't

3369.92 --> 3374.2400000000002
need pictures of the ice wall to prove

3371.76 --> 3377.8390000000004
the earth is flat you just need to

3374.24 --> 3377.839
look around

3378.16 --> 3382.799
and realize how geometry works the

3381.119 --> 3391.839
natural consequences of

3382.799 --> 3391.839
geometric obstruction

3399.52 --> 3404.64
he was a netflix duck yeah but the

3402.4 --> 3405.599
netflix dog was kind of a mockery piece

3404.64 --> 3408.0
so

3405.599 --> 3409.6800000000003
but still because of that mockery piece

3408.0 --> 3411.92
there there are

3409.68 --> 3413.2
actual names out there including mark

3411.92 --> 3416.4
sergeants

3413.2 --> 3419.5989999999997
and bob nodell and jaren

3416.4 --> 3421.76
the thing is whether they are straying

3419.599 --> 3425.04
from purity if

3421.76 --> 3426.1600000000003
one would even want to go there they're

3425.04 --> 3429.119
still

3426.16 --> 3429.839
originally actual flat earthers that are

3429.119 --> 3432.319
not just

3429.839 --> 3435.2799999999997
misinformation agents from the get-go

3432.319 --> 3438.48
although yeah with bob

3435.28 --> 3439.8390000000004
it's kind of dubious he kind of is he is

3438.48 --> 3443.119
turning out to be just

3439.839 --> 3446.72
just that just counter opposite of

3443.119 --> 3450.7200000000003
logic and science and

3446.72 --> 3451.1189999999997
right but yeah mark sergeant is also in

3450.72 --> 3455.04
there

3451.119 --> 3457.52
and because of that their names are

3455.04 --> 3458.079
there for people to bump into and look

3457.52 --> 3460.559
up

3458.079 --> 3462.0
and through those people and their

3460.559 --> 3465.8390000000004
internet activities

3462.0 --> 3465.839
connect to others like us

3466.16 --> 3470.319
how many people have buying over the

3468.64 --> 3473.359
years bumped in

3470.319 --> 3475.52
came in and chatted oh my

3473.359 --> 3476.799
bought goodness the rotation of the

3475.52 --> 3480.4
earth

3476.799 --> 3485.7599999999998
well they're probably on the scene

3480.4 --> 3487.76
because they watched that documentary

3485.76 --> 3488.88
realized there are flat earthers out

3487.76 --> 3493.599
there and then

3488.88 --> 3495.76
joined on the scene trolls join that way

3493.599 --> 3497.04
but also people that are genuinely

3495.76 --> 3501.0400000000004
interested

3497.04 --> 3504.0
so again that publicity

3501.04 --> 3506.799
is never just bad publicity it just gets

3504.0 --> 3506.799
things moving

3514.96 --> 3522.2400000000002
there is no edge napoleon de joras

3519.76 --> 3523.2000000000003
the edge is real that's misinformation

3522.24 --> 3527.1189999999997
nobody claims

3523.2 --> 3529.68
the flat earth has an edge the globe

3527.119 --> 3531.359
should have an edge a geometric sphere

3529.68 --> 3545.839
edge yet it's not there

3531.359 --> 3545.839
black swan

3553.92 --> 3557.52
the dome could be the content well

3556.16 --> 3560.5589999999997
that's cute yeah

3557.52 --> 3563.68
a dome could be a form of containment

3560.559 --> 3568.0
now whether it is a dome

3563.68 --> 3570.48
that is to be figured out

3568.0 --> 3572.079
because there's no proof of that it's

3570.48 --> 3587.839
just proof that there is containment

3572.079 --> 3587.8390000000004
because we have gas pressure

3590.24 --> 3594.319
no nobody cares about the likes dislikes

3592.64 --> 3596.64
at this moment i care more that there's

3594.319 --> 3597.359
an actual conversation going with my

3596.64 --> 3598.8799999999997
chat

3597.359 --> 3600.88
it's much more interesting than the

3598.88 --> 3601.6800000000003
votes give a [ __ ] it's probably because

3600.88 --> 3604.6400000000003
i just

3601.68 --> 3607.44
talked about bob again and then there's

3604.64 --> 3615.839
plenty of trolls

3607.44 --> 3615.839
that do that [ __ ]

3617.2 --> 3621.4399999999996
or maybe not i don't know i don't really

3619.359 --> 3629.839
care at this moment

3621.44 --> 3629.839
the votes is just garbage

3643.52 --> 3648.64
oh mark smiler hello again yeah

3646.799 --> 3650.88
yeah your comment from yesterday is

3648.64 --> 3651.68
quite nutty i'm not gonna respond to

3650.88 --> 3655.599
that

3651.68 --> 3657.839
look i am not your psychologist or

3655.599 --> 3657.839
whatever

3659.44 --> 3662.64
look you can keep on sharing these big

3661.92 --> 3664.64
things

3662.64 --> 3671.839
with me but that doesn't mean that i'm

3664.64 --> 3671.839
always going to be listening to that

3683.04 --> 3690.319
what can i get a code of some kind

3688.079 --> 3692.88
that says there's an answer coming or

3690.319 --> 3692.88
not what

3694.0 --> 3699.839
what does that mean

3708.64 --> 3718.72
what level freeman gods

3713.119 --> 3727.839
zero nathan oakley is not a freemason

3718.72 --> 3727.839
it's ridiculous

3728.24 --> 3735.359
yes and technically

3732.24 --> 3739.1189999999997
he might have just gone into it

3735.359 --> 3739.68
to check it out like i would rather see

3739.119 --> 3741.92
him

3739.68 --> 3744.0789999999997
just bluff his way through and just say

3741.92 --> 3747.119
he's a freemason and even try to

3744.079 --> 3750.6400000000003
figure some things out by acting like it

3747.119 --> 3755.839
but he's not that's ridiculous

3750.64 --> 3755.839
he's not somebody who would do that

3756.799 --> 3760.079
because he really doesn't give a [ __ ]

3758.48 --> 3762.48
about that sort of thing at all

3760.079 --> 3768.4
he's very anti-religious and

3762.48 --> 3774.4
anti-religious tradition

3768.4 --> 3774.4
is this why did you time him out

3774.48 --> 3783.839
and get it

3785.52 --> 3788.88
dude it's mark taylor

3790.319 --> 3796.5589999999997
liar who cares like you don't need to

3794.079 --> 3799.119
time him out for that

3796.559 --> 3800.1600000000003
and he's freaking mark taylor yeah he

3799.119 --> 3803.44
abused me

3800.16 --> 3806.72
hello mark taylor is a troll

3803.44 --> 3810.799
from four years ago

3806.72 --> 3815.2
who gives a [ __ ]

3810.799 --> 3815.2
this is serious

3817.52 --> 3821.359
like mark taylor is a is kind of a

3819.76 --> 3825.8390000000004
deviant so

3821.359 --> 3825.839
doesn't really matter

3835.599 --> 3841.119
all right he said oh help the e

3838.88 --> 3843.839
beggar and smashed it like oh that's

3841.119 --> 3843.839
very cute

3844.559 --> 3852.2400000000002
yeah but technically he's right

3848.96 --> 3854.319
because i am an e beggar

3852.24 --> 3855.7599999999998
in a technical sense it's just not

3854.319 --> 3860.079
that's the only thing i do

3855.76 --> 3862.6400000000003
because i actually have things that i do

3860.079 --> 3864.559
it's not just begging it's just my way

3862.64 --> 3866.64
to get around

3864.559 --> 3869.3590000000004
it's more like a street artist i

3866.64 --> 3873.2
actually perform

3869.359 --> 3876.64
on a regular daily basis for two hours

3873.2 --> 3880.3999999999996
so i think i deserve

3876.64 --> 3882.5589999999997
some compensation for my work i hope

3880.4 --> 3884.64
that i deserve that and other people

3882.559 --> 3886.48
seem to think so i

3884.64 --> 3888.4
see it's always they're always trying to

3886.48 --> 3890.079
troll always trying to put that light

3888.4 --> 3892.799
out but it's really to convince

3890.079 --> 3892.799
themselves

3892.96 --> 3896.48
to get that negative interpretation

3895.92 --> 3899.28
image

3896.48 --> 3899.68
onto themselves so they can have their

3899.28 --> 3901.88
own

3899.68 --> 3903.9199999999996
little petty moment of apparent

3901.88 --> 3906.079
superiority

3903.92 --> 3907.92
it doesn't work though because i when i

3906.079 --> 3909.039
address it and just lay out what it

3907.92 --> 3911.839
really is

3909.039 --> 3914.2400000000002
see it's completely dispelled so i don't

3911.839 --> 3916.88
even find that a time-out worthy

3914.24 --> 3916.8799999999997
offense

3919.599 --> 3922.799
you're an online performer yes and

3922.16 --> 3926.24
teacher

3922.799 --> 3929.119
i hope even though

3926.24 --> 3929.1189999999997
i'm not perfect

3931.2 --> 3937.839
but i'm doing my best

3939.52 --> 3944.96
the thing is i never had any

3942.559 --> 3947.3590000000004
study for being a teacher or any

3944.96 --> 3948.2400000000002
training it's just i just started to do

3947.359 --> 3950.0789999999997
that

3948.24 --> 3951.5989999999997
and i kind of always wanted to since

3950.079 --> 3953.92
yeah

3951.599 --> 3955.839
both my parents like my family is full

3953.92 --> 3956.319
of teachers my mother was a teacher my

3955.839 --> 3960.5589999999997
father

3956.319 --> 3960.5589999999997
was a guitar teacher

3960.72 --> 3966.799
and my aunt and my grandmother are all

3964.319 --> 3966.799
teachers

3968.64 --> 3971.68
so i got it in me

3973.039 --> 3978.0
it's just that i never really developed

3976.319 --> 3981.2799999999997
an official profession with

3978.0 --> 3984.24
it because pretty early on i learned

3981.28 --> 3985.92
that you're just made to pump out

3984.24 --> 3988.0789999999997
curriculum

3985.92 --> 3989.2000000000003
and learn them and then make other

3988.079 --> 3992.319
people make

3989.2 --> 3995.1189999999997
the the students uphold that and

3992.319 --> 3996.48
force that when i know it's wrong and

3995.119 --> 3998.6400000000003
that's horrific

3996.48 --> 3999.92
or there's nothing more horrific to me

3998.64 --> 4002.24
than have

3999.92 --> 4004.0
to be forced to be a teacher and teach

4002.24 --> 4006.9599999999996
things that are wrong

4004.0 --> 4008.64
just to get by that's so stressful i

4006.96 --> 4010.7200000000003
would not survive that

4008.64 --> 4012.64
so that's why i never really became a

4010.72 --> 4021.839
teacher i'm just

4012.64 --> 4021.839
teaching now in what i do

4022.88 --> 4025.92
why does men love power and authority so

4025.359 --> 4028.96
much

4025.92 --> 4030.7200000000003
they don't they're just seduced by it

4028.96 --> 4032.96
because people that actually have power

4030.72 --> 4035.319
and authority they're often miserable

4032.96 --> 4038.2400000000002
and then power and authority is just the

4035.319 --> 4040.72
consolidation prize

4038.24 --> 4042.8799999999997
to kind of be able to escape from how

4040.72 --> 4043.68
freaking miserable their actual lives

4042.88 --> 4047.6800000000003
are

4043.68 --> 4049.52
you see so yeah power and authority

4047.68 --> 4051.5989999999997
it's very appealing when you don't have

4049.52 --> 4053.359
it to your instinct it's

4051.599 --> 4054.799
lucifer seducing you but when you

4053.359 --> 4059.359
actually get it

4054.799 --> 4063.839
it never what it's felt

4059.359 --> 4063.839
or what you thought it was never is

4064.0 --> 4077.839
i'm very glad i know that this is

4083.2 --> 4086.0789999999997
ah son mao

4087.68 --> 4093.359
as you are a wisdom and a searcher

4090.72 --> 4093.359
evolving

4094.48 --> 4108.319
how are you doing

4105.04 --> 4111.12
i'm doing great and yeah i keep on going

4108.319 --> 4112.96
i see it much more like this is some

4111.12 --> 4116.4
kind of religious journey but

4112.96 --> 4117.359
personal or spiritual journey how yeah

4116.4 --> 4121.04
in a religious

4117.359 --> 4124.319
kind of a kind of difficult word now

4121.04 --> 4126.159
it's just colloquially religious

4124.319 --> 4129.759
it's just very personal and very

4126.159 --> 4129.759
spiritual and it's all about

4130.4 --> 4137.92
how much can i persist to actually be

4133.92 --> 4141.04
myself and develop that

4137.92 --> 4143.92
versus the world and that's just the

4141.04 --> 4143.92
thing that i'm doing

4145.12 --> 4149.3589999999995
and hopefully also kind of inspiring

4147.359 --> 4149.839
others to do it because this world is

4149.359 --> 4152.64
just

4149.839 --> 4154.719
it strips you of everything it seduces

4152.64 --> 4156.2390000000005
you and it strips you of your soul of

4154.719 --> 4159.679
your spirit of your will of

4156.239 --> 4164.0
everything rapidly unreasonably

4159.679 --> 4167.12
rapidly it takes it away very quickly

4164.0 --> 4168.799
which is extremely damaging it it's

4167.12 --> 4171.04
disruptive

4168.799 --> 4173.359
for everything so i'm just trying to

4171.04 --> 4175.679
give an example of like how you can deal

4173.359 --> 4178.719
with this world without letting it strip

4175.679 --> 4178.719
you off everything

4179.759 --> 4183.6
everything that's actually enjoyable by

4181.839 --> 4186.3189999999995
life

4183.6 --> 4186.799
but it is especially at first it is all

4186.319 --> 4190.4800000000005
about

4186.799 --> 4194.4
being able to resist

4190.48 --> 4196.239
the seductions because this entire world

4194.4 --> 4200.159
seduces

4196.239 --> 4203.839999999999
you right uh is there any reason why you

4200.159 --> 4203.839999999999
keep quoting me

4213.84 --> 4221.28
which seductions or which

4217.44 --> 4224.48
seductions doesn't it utilize everything

4221.28 --> 4226.8
everything that on every level

4224.48 --> 4227.759999999999
but especially the most basic level with

4226.8 --> 4231.4400000000005
sex

4227.76 --> 4234.8
with money with power with

4231.44 --> 4237.599999999999
indulgence especially like

4234.8 --> 4239.84
it's okay to just let it all go to don't

4237.6 --> 4242.08
give a [ __ ] to walk away from tradition

4239.84 --> 4246.719
to be disrespectful

4242.08 --> 4246.719
all for you that

4247.28 --> 4251.12
that it has an extremely disruptive

4249.28 --> 4255.12
influence

4251.12 --> 4255.12
on people that start to believe it

4255.36 --> 4261.28
because they do

4258.88 --> 4265.4400000000005
because nobody seems to care that much

4261.28 --> 4265.44
anymore because it's already so bad out

4270.84 --> 4273.84
there

4278.48 --> 4282.159
okay find a god sure

4284.84 --> 4287.84
thanks

4291.52 --> 4298.84
but one cannot indulge oneself no

4295.84 --> 4300.159000000001
look doesn't mean that you don't have

4298.84 --> 4302.64
urges

4300.159 --> 4303.36
but you have to deal with them it's not

4302.64 --> 4305.679
just about

4303.36 --> 4307.92
okay we have this urge that means that

4305.679 --> 4310.96
every time it comes up

4307.92 --> 4312.159
just give it whatever it wants no every

4310.96 --> 4315.679
urge

4312.159 --> 4318.08
has to be figured out and tamed

4315.679 --> 4320.0
so that it can lead to more productive

4318.08 --> 4329.84
things instead of just

4320.0 --> 4329.84
consume your energy and focus

4337.6 --> 4343.84
but to say like you no one can ever

4340.239 --> 4343.839999999999
indulge that's just impossible

4345.36 --> 4349.92
because you yeah you do start out

4348.96 --> 4353.199
indulging like

4349.92 --> 4355.1990000000005
people grow up like that and as a kid

4353.199 --> 4356.799999999999
very small kid you just have that

4355.199 --> 4357.759999999999
because you're trying to explore what

4356.8 --> 4360.8
you want so

4357.76 --> 4362.64
it always starts out

4360.8 --> 4365.4400000000005
that you're already indulging in things

4362.64 --> 4368.96
and then you need to deal with them

4365.44 --> 4369.44
see it's all about realizing what you

4368.96 --> 4373.12
got

4369.44 --> 4373.12
and then learning how to deal with it

4374.8 --> 4378.719
and a good guide for that in my opinion

4376.96 --> 4380.4
is the path of christ it's just

4378.719 --> 4382.88
the things that he taught but when

4380.4 --> 4386.799999999999
you're very young you're much more

4382.88 --> 4389.2390000000005
likely to not like that to be like no

4386.8 --> 4391.76
that's too difficult or i find that

4389.239 --> 4394.4
unreasonably tough

4391.76 --> 4397.1990000000005
but then yeah you will face those

4394.4 --> 4399.44
lessons and then eventually

4397.199 --> 4402.159
you will when you grow older and wiser

4399.44 --> 4405.04
and figure out like yeah

4402.159 --> 4407.599999999999
wow i apparently needed to do that but

4405.04 --> 4409.76
it was correct after all

4407.6 --> 4410.88
and that's wisdom so that you can

4409.76 --> 4412.96
finally see

4410.88 --> 4416.08
why because when you're younger you

4412.96 --> 4416.08
cannot see why

4421.36 --> 4426.239
or maybe you can see why and you just

4424.239 --> 4429.919999999999
the urge is too strong to resist

4426.239 --> 4434.159
you got to do it anyway depends

4429.92 --> 4434.159
what kind of person you are naturally

4438.48 --> 4442.5599999999995
religion never worked for me well it's

4441.28 --> 4445.44
not about religion

4442.56 --> 4445.76
it's look i am not religious like that i

4445.44 --> 4449.36
just

4445.76 --> 4454.2390000000005
look at christ the intention of christ

4449.36 --> 4456.719
how that worked what he tried to teach

4454.239 --> 4457.28
that's my real christianity that's the

4456.719 --> 4460.159
thing that's

4457.28 --> 4462.48
important and that everybody will

4460.159 --> 4463.92
recognize is important even if you're

4462.48 --> 4466.718999999999
not a christian

4463.92 --> 4468.159
unless you're just a squirting demon

4466.719 --> 4472.0
that just wants to destroy

4468.159 --> 4475.04
everything good or you still have

4472.0 --> 4477.04
high christ allergy obstacles

4475.04 --> 4478.88
i used to have them a lot it was very

4477.04 --> 4481.92
defensive against it

4478.88 --> 4483.92
when it was brought up but now i just

4481.92 --> 4485.76
understand

4483.92 --> 4489.4400000000005
it's not about what people say about the

4485.76 --> 4491.84
bible it's what christ says in the bible

4489.44 --> 4494.32
and what that means and how that

4491.84 --> 4497.84
reflects over the ages as you grow older

4494.32 --> 4497.84
and wiser hopefully

4513.92 --> 4520.05
about redemption yes

4516.94 --> 4520.049999999999
[Music]

4520.64 --> 4527.360000000001
but also like what is what is wisdom

4524.239 --> 4530.239
because wisdom is is attained

4527.36 --> 4531.5199999999995
by the older much easier than the

4530.239 --> 4533.28
younger

4531.52 --> 4536.400000000001
but that doesn't mean that there is just

4533.28 --> 4538.719
a universal framework

4536.4 --> 4539.839999999999
that could be prepared for younger

4538.719 --> 4541.52
people

4539.84 --> 4542.96
then even though they don't understand

4541.52 --> 4545.679
it they will

4542.96 --> 4546.96
follow and respect their elders in it

4545.679 --> 4550.719
and then

4546.96 --> 4554.56
already get a good start out

4550.719 --> 4557.6
basically finding a good railroad

4554.56 --> 4560.64
vantage point to

4557.6 --> 4564.2390000000005
already be very close to walking the pas

4560.64 --> 4566.320000000001
path of christ and then other challenges

4564.239 --> 4567.28
will face them but that real road will

4566.32 --> 4570.48
already be

4567.28 --> 4572.48
pretty solid for them now i have not

4570.48 --> 4574.32
come from that point i was basically

4572.48 --> 4575.5199999999995
very much opposed to it i thought it was

4574.32 --> 4578.0
offensive like

4575.52 --> 4579.040000000001
is this is who determines that that is

4578.0 --> 4582.64
reality like

4579.04 --> 4586.64
like that was very offended by it in

4582.64 --> 4586.64
many ways because i wanted that freedom

4589.76 --> 4597.52
so i have basically tested it more

4595.04 --> 4600.88
because it offended me and because i

4597.52 --> 4600.88
didn't want to respect it

4602.239 --> 4609.199
but i also feared to just blaspheme

4605.52 --> 4613.040000000001
outright i did fear christ anyway it's

4609.199 --> 4615.5199999999995
it's very weird how that will work

4613.04 --> 4617.92
and now i just understand much better

4615.52 --> 4620.320000000001
also that

4617.92 --> 4621.84
what most people think of things

4620.32 --> 4624.96
including the bible

4621.84 --> 4627.52
is just superficial exoteric

4624.96 --> 4628.2390000000005
interpretations things that they heard

4627.52 --> 4630.64
other people

4628.239 --> 4632.0
say that they thought was a big

4630.64 --> 4634.84
important thing

4632.0 --> 4636.159
and it wasn't it was actually a

4634.84 --> 4640.32
distraction

4636.159 --> 4640.32
of the more esoteric essence

4645.44 --> 4649.12
like just becoming a christian just

4648.159 --> 4651.679
having a bible

4649.12 --> 4653.92
and going to church it doesn't do

4651.679 --> 4657.84
anything

4653.92 --> 4660.719
you have to figure out that there's also

4657.84 --> 4661.6
delusions and seductions and big

4660.719 --> 4664.32
mistakes

4661.6 --> 4665.52
often not even on purpose but just make

4664.32 --> 4669.759999999999
big mistakes the devil

4665.52 --> 4672.2390000000005
slips in as it were even in christians

4669.76 --> 4675.679
misleads makes you believe certain

4672.239 --> 4675.678999999999
things are important that aren't

4677.36 --> 4681.679
and that happens a lot and it was my

4680.64 --> 4685.12
main obstacle

4681.679 --> 4687.6
i i was expectant at first

4685.12 --> 4689.599999999999
very young like okay so this christ

4687.6 --> 4691.84
really is the thing right

4689.6 --> 4693.84
so if i go to a church that means

4691.84 --> 4697.1990000000005
there's going to be extremely

4693.84 --> 4699.04
wise and sharp people out there that are

4697.199 --> 4702.639999999999
really wise

4699.04 --> 4703.36
and really get it but yeah reality

4702.64 --> 4707.679
proved to me

4703.36 --> 4709.5199999999995
like no not at all it's cheap

4707.679 --> 4711.36
it's people there's a lot of people in

4709.52 --> 4713.120000000001
there that just think because they

4711.36 --> 4715.04
are christian because they have the

4713.12 --> 4715.679
stamp because they do the traditions the

4715.04 --> 4717.84
things

4715.679 --> 4718.84
that that that everything is all right

4717.84 --> 4721.84
and that they can

4718.84 --> 4722.96
indulge in whatever their ego brings

4721.84 --> 4725.12
forward

4722.96 --> 4727.679
as long as they just follow certain type

4725.12 --> 4731.04
of structure

4727.679 --> 4732.08
with the rest and so they dwell in other

4731.04 --> 4734.56
ways

4732.08 --> 4736.48
and that was such a huge disappointment

4734.56 --> 4740.080000000001
to notice that that i just

4736.48 --> 4742.0
lost my faith in the concept of churches

4740.08 --> 4749.84
entirely at first

4742.0 --> 4749.84
just like this is this is a trap

4760.84 --> 4763.84
um

4788.84 --> 4791.84
do

4795.679 --> 4799.76
hmm right

4803.04 --> 4806.719
was externally look that's just the

4806.159 --> 4810.08
bible

4806.719 --> 4813.28
is a lot of things there's there's many

4810.08 --> 4813.28
ways of approaching it

4814.0 --> 4817.36
and there is the the

4817.6 --> 4824.0
the planetary cosmology

4821.36 --> 4826.239
no not cosmology ah you call this it's

4824.0 --> 4826.239
just

4827.44 --> 4835.199
there's another name for it

4832.159 --> 4838.5599999999995
yeah a lot of the story

4835.199 --> 4842.08
or parts of the story are also

4838.56 --> 4846.719
also relate structurally to celestial

4842.08 --> 4849.12
events that happen

4846.719 --> 4851.199
and that's in there too it is also

4849.12 --> 4854.8
basically a guide

4851.199 --> 4857.839999999999
a symbolic guide to celestial events

4854.8 --> 4859.1990000000005
now that is that that is there has been

4857.84 --> 4862.2390000000005
used

4859.199 --> 4862.5599999999995
especially by atheist to basically poo

4862.239 --> 4864.48
poo

4862.56 --> 4866.639
and say oh it's all just metaphoric it's

4864.48 --> 4868.159
nothing is real because that is in there

4866.639 --> 4870.8
you can interpret it that way well

4868.159 --> 4872.799999999999
that's wrong

4870.8 --> 4875.04
because there are many this is what i

4872.8 --> 4878.639
say about it there are many ways

4875.04 --> 4881.76
to read the bible and to look out for

4878.639 --> 4885.84
things to find structures in there

4881.76 --> 4889.12
and yeah they might seem to contrast

4885.84 --> 4891.6
but they don't not really it's all true

4889.12 --> 4892.239
all of it you find within the bible

4891.6 --> 4903.84
whatever

4892.239 --> 4903.839999999999
you're looking for

4917.04 --> 4920.56
are you talking about

4925.36 --> 4928.799999999999
many levels butchered by jesuits in

4927.6 --> 4931.84
almost intellible

4928.8 --> 4931.84
nonsense i don't know

4932.639 --> 4939.1990000000005
i think what the there was just a lot of

4935.92 --> 4939.1990000000005
exoteric filler

4939.44 --> 4943.04
on top of things i think they just added

4941.84 --> 4945.04
on things that we've

4943.04 --> 4959.84
are taking for granted that were

4945.04 --> 4959.84
probably not part of the original

4963.199 --> 4968.08
i don't know about that seeking star

4964.88 --> 4973.04
wars i have no idea

4968.08 --> 4977.44
it's extremely complicated

4973.04 --> 4981.92
no i mean esoteric exoteric

4977.44 --> 4981.919999999999
not esoteric they are counter opposite

4982.32 --> 4990.239
they are two sides of the same spectrum

4986.0 --> 4992.639
exoteric esoteric is the true essential

4990.239 --> 4992.638999999999
meaning

4993.6 --> 4996.719
like the purpose

4996.89 --> 5001.52
[Music]

4998.08 --> 5005.6
and that can be multiple purposes

5001.52 --> 5008.8
esoteric is basically

5005.6 --> 5010.2390000000005
typical typically what leads from exit

5008.8 --> 5013.92
terrorism

5010.239 --> 5016.0
is traditionalism is you start to take

5013.92 --> 5018.32
symbols and then it becomes very

5016.0 --> 5022.239
important in what order

5018.32 --> 5024.88
the thing is put down and

5022.239 --> 5025.759999999999
what it actually means is overlooked is

5024.88 --> 5028.400000000001
not understood

5025.76 --> 5030.08
it's forgotten or it's not shared from

5028.4 --> 5032.638999999999
the higher priesthood

5030.08 --> 5033.199
and then so you get traditionalism where

5032.639 --> 5035.28
it's just

5033.199 --> 5036.5599999999995
it's important that you read it exactly

5035.28 --> 5039.5199999999995
like this

5036.56 --> 5041.679
and and people don't ponder on the

5039.52 --> 5043.52
meeting anymore they just ponder on we

5041.679 --> 5045.6
have to do this thing right these are

5043.52 --> 5048.719
these rituals these traditions

5045.6 --> 5050.159000000001
and that is typically exoterraism where

5048.719 --> 5057.84
the form

5050.159 --> 5057.839999999999
becomes more important than the essence

5060.32 --> 5064.719
and catholicism is filled up with that

5062.8 --> 5071.84
[ __ ]

5064.719 --> 5071.84
it's very exoteric

5086.199 --> 5101.5199999999995
ethiopian cannon wet

5099.6 --> 5103.6
exoteric can be on this no that's the

5101.52 --> 5104.719
whole point it doesn't have to be

5103.6 --> 5108.56
understood

5104.719 --> 5108.56
it just has to be memorized

5108.719 --> 5112.0
it's just a claim like if you do this

5110.88 --> 5113.4400000000005
you'll go to heaven

5112.0 --> 5116.0
you'll just have to do this this this

5113.44 --> 5118.0
and this have to

5116.0 --> 5119.92
have to pray every day have to read the

5118.0 --> 5121.44
book you have to go to church you have

5119.92 --> 5125.28
to

5121.44 --> 5127.28
be baptized that is exoterics

5125.28 --> 5128.639
if you don't understand what it actually

5127.28 --> 5132.0
is for

5128.639 --> 5134.639
now you might get told what it is for

5132.0 --> 5137.199
not actually explaining the bigger core

5134.639 --> 5139.52
essence of it all where it came from

5137.199 --> 5140.719
the white history of where that all came

5139.52 --> 5143.120000000001
from

5140.719 --> 5144.4
it won't be shared so it becomes

5143.12 --> 5146.08
esoteric because

5144.4 --> 5147.599999999999
you're following these steps you're just

5146.08 --> 5149.04
trusting it's the right thing to do

5147.6 --> 5149.679
because it was told it was the right

5149.04 --> 5151.84
thing to do

5149.679 --> 5154.2390000000005
but you don't understand it you're

5151.84 --> 5159.4400000000005
basically doing these things blindly

5154.239 --> 5159.44
and that's exoteric you're just

5160.159 --> 5166.48
doing things you don't understand

5164.239 --> 5167.28
you might get your own interpretation

5166.48 --> 5169.36
you might

5167.28 --> 5172.0
evolve your own interpretation by your

5169.36 --> 5176.639
own volition as to what it means and why

5172.0 --> 5178.96
your personal religion but

5176.639 --> 5181.28
that doesn't mean that you actually get

5178.96 --> 5183.44
the true essence of it correct because

5181.28 --> 5185.92
to get that right you have to go through

5183.44 --> 5189.28
a lot

5185.92 --> 5193.04
and also be confronted with the errors

5189.28 --> 5196.08
of the religious system

5193.04 --> 5197.04
that you're starting out with and then

5196.08 --> 5200.0
confront

5197.04 --> 5201.44
and then get the penalties you'll get

5200.0 --> 5205.76
power against you

5201.44 --> 5209.199
well guess what that thing in specific

5205.76 --> 5211.360000000001
that specific thing being confronting

5209.199 --> 5214.159
with errors and lies and power

5211.36 --> 5215.599999999999
getting punished guess what that's at

5214.159 --> 5218.4
the core

5215.6 --> 5219.120000000001
of the path of christ it's the essence

5218.4 --> 5221.04
that's

5219.12 --> 5222.88
that's the thing you're supposed to do

5221.04 --> 5225.5199999999995
it's the whole purpose of it

5222.88 --> 5227.1990000000005
and it's all hidden under a exoteric

5225.52 --> 5232.4800000000005
religious

5227.199 --> 5232.48
mechanism isn't that just crazy

5233.41 --> 5236.5289999999995
[Music]

5237.6 --> 5245.4400000000005
because christ is all about the truth

5241.679 --> 5248.159
it's the only real thing that matters

5245.44 --> 5248.96
the essence of the truth the purity of

5248.159 --> 5252.96
the truth

5248.96 --> 5257.679
and the risk and the penalties

5252.96 --> 5260.32
of the truth the price you have to pay

5257.679 --> 5262.4
versus the world that is ruled by the

5260.32 --> 5267.84
devil

5262.4 --> 5267.839999999999
by non-spiritual things

5278.719 --> 5282.4800000000005
yeah you could see it you could

5280.32 --> 5283.44
oversimplify it even to a point where

5282.48 --> 5286.239
you say

5283.44 --> 5289.04
there's the truth and then there is

5286.239 --> 5291.678999999999
power and control

5289.04 --> 5295.84
how are you going to manage everything

5291.679 --> 5295.84
in the face of these two

5296.0 --> 5301.76
those are the really big essential

5298.159 --> 5309.839999999999
questions for every individual

5301.76 --> 5309.84
all the time

5320.84 --> 5326.159000000001
so

5322.4 --> 5337.839999999999
hmm oh you got some good instincts there

5326.159 --> 5337.839999999999
zach sterling

5377.84 --> 5382.56
what do you think youtube supports or

5381.04 --> 5385.92
denounces that's not a

5382.56 --> 5393.84
that's a malformed question it's not

5385.92 --> 5393.84
stupid it's just male forms

5397.199 --> 5403.599999999999
youtube created the modern

5399.6 --> 5405.52
popularization of fla yeah maybe

5403.6 --> 5407.4400000000005
i think they just originally wanted the

5405.52 --> 5410.400000000001
corner for the market which they knew

5407.44 --> 5414.0
was going to be very big

5410.4 --> 5414.0
that there would be a lot of people that

5414.239 --> 5418.5599999999995
would still go with it on the internet

5416.96 --> 5420.32
because it's not face to face

5418.56 --> 5421.679
and i think they just played into it and

5420.32 --> 5424.96
even they might have like

5421.679 --> 5426.56
said like it's forbidden oh don't go to

5424.96 --> 5430.08
flat earth they'll go to flat earth

5426.56 --> 5430.96
just to get people like oh that means we

5430.08 --> 5434.4
gotta go

5430.96 --> 5435.28
to the flat earth it might be because is

5434.4 --> 5438.5599999999995
the crackdown

5435.28 --> 5441.36
that big if it was really that bad they

5438.56 --> 5443.4400000000005
would just delete it all

5441.36 --> 5445.12
they would just scan out for people

5443.44 --> 5447.44
talking

5445.12 --> 5449.679
flat earth and just remove all of it but

5447.44 --> 5452.0
they haven't really done that

5449.679 --> 5454.159
they just make it a little tougher for

5452.0 --> 5463.84
flat earthers

5454.159 --> 5463.839999999999
a little tougher but not impossible

5474.84 --> 5480.400000000001
hmm they won't allow people to take

5477.92 --> 5482.639
pause they want to keep on acting at

5480.4 --> 5491.839999999999
what what does that mean

5482.639 --> 5491.84
i don't understand the context

5505.44 --> 5510.32
what is the mark of the beast oh god

5508.639 --> 5511.76
well if you're going to ask me in an

5510.32 --> 5514.0
esoteric setting

5511.76 --> 5514.0
then

5514.8 --> 5518.08
i don't know what it says it is an

5517.04 --> 5520.0
irreversible

5518.08 --> 5522.5599999999995
thing that once you get it you can't get

5520.0 --> 5523.44
it off now if you go by esoterics it

5522.56 --> 5525.84
might

5523.44 --> 5527.44
connect to something more spiritually

5525.84 --> 5530.32
mystical

5527.44 --> 5531.36
it might be an actual mark of the beast

5530.32 --> 5533.28
like a devil

5531.36 --> 5535.12
thing and once you have it on your

5533.28 --> 5538.159
spirit you can never

5535.12 --> 5539.44
become what you were it changes you

5538.159 --> 5542.638999999999
irreversibly but

5539.44 --> 5546.48
if that were the case

5542.639 --> 5549.12
then it has to do with

5546.48 --> 5550.638999999999
basically surrendering to the devil in

5549.12 --> 5554.8
the spiritual dimension

5550.639 --> 5559.28
and just say like no i just want

5554.8 --> 5562.0
i just want wanting things

5559.28 --> 5563.36
that's really what it is and your spirit

5562.0 --> 5566.639
just decides

5563.36 --> 5570.32
i just want wanting things i don't

5566.639 --> 5572.159000000001
want to care i just want what i want

5570.32 --> 5574.0
and i don't want to care and once you

5572.159 --> 5576.5599999999995
kind of like your spirit latches

5574.0 --> 5578.4
on to that that might be considered as

5576.56 --> 5581.6
the mark of the beast

5578.4 --> 5585.36
because when people get to that point

5581.6 --> 5586.56
it's almost impossible to ever reverse

5585.36 --> 5589.44
that

5586.56 --> 5591.280000000001
once they snap into that it's almost

5589.44 --> 5595.12
impossible it's like

5591.28 --> 5595.12
darth vader level complex

5595.6 --> 5598.639
like things have to like completely blow

5598.0 --> 5602.159
up or

5598.639 --> 5604.32
die or just dramatic change for

5602.159 --> 5605.839999999999
even a remote possibility of that

5604.32 --> 5608.0
actually reversing

5605.84 --> 5610.96
so yeah it all depends on how you're

5608.0 --> 5613.12
going to approach that

5610.96 --> 5614.32
what are you gonna take that literal

5613.12 --> 5616.159
exoteric

5614.32 --> 5617.84
as a literal thing or whether you're

5616.159 --> 5620.5599999999995
going to take that as spiritual

5617.84 --> 5621.6
metaphor because the spiritual metaphor

5620.56 --> 5624.56
i can

5621.6 --> 5626.08
basically say yeah that exists it's part

5624.56 --> 5628.159000000001
of the psyche

5626.08 --> 5630.0
it's an option it's part of the design

5628.159 --> 5633.28
that is possible

5630.0 --> 5634.32
and it may not be as out in the open as

5633.28 --> 5636.88
everybody thinks

5634.32 --> 5638.719
it's just something that people at some

5636.88 --> 5642.56
point

5638.719 --> 5644.08
decide or decide against they might be

5642.56 --> 5646.4800000000005
seduced into choosing

5644.08 --> 5647.5199999999995
that they might be convinced that that

5646.48 --> 5650.239
is okay that

5647.52 --> 5652.639
that's normal or that is whatever

5650.239 --> 5655.759999999999
whatever it takes to make you

5652.639 --> 5659.84
go for that decision that you just want

5655.76 --> 5659.84
to want and you don't want to care

5662.159 --> 5665.36
and then yeah depends on how far you go

5664.639 --> 5667.12
how far you

5665.36 --> 5669.04
act on that and then at some point it

5667.12 --> 5672.4
becomes irreversible

5669.04 --> 5675.12
becomes too punishing

5672.4 --> 5678.5599999999995
to drop that and start seeing for what

5675.12 --> 5678.5599999999995
things for what they are again

5681.84 --> 5685.1990000000005
right no 666 carbon well you could say

5684.8 --> 5688.4800000000005
that

5685.199 --> 5688.48
and then say it's just

5688.719 --> 5694.4
yeah what you want just

5691.84 --> 5696.639
stuff i just want stuff i just want my

5694.4 --> 5698.5599999999995
nice little dream and i don't care about

5696.639 --> 5701.84
the reality anymore i don't care about

5698.56 --> 5701.84
the consequences anymore

5708.159 --> 5711.44
that that's what i consider the mark of

5710.08 --> 5715.04
the beast and people that

5711.44 --> 5717.759999999999
act like this i

5715.04 --> 5721.199
don't take that lightly it's like big

5717.76 --> 5724.639
warning because it's like they are

5721.199 --> 5724.638999999999
effectively possessed

5726.96 --> 5731.04
they might not be acting out maniacal

5729.6 --> 5734.320000000001
necessarily but they

5731.04 --> 5736.0
are possessed they are in its grip and

5734.32 --> 5737.92
not coming out

5736.0 --> 5739.6
so i consider that the mark of the beast

5737.92 --> 5742.32
and i take great heed

5739.6 --> 5743.84
of that and yeah here's another

5742.32 --> 5746.239
unfortunate reality

5743.84 --> 5747.84
they're everywhere in everything almost

5746.239 --> 5752.239
every family

5747.84 --> 5755.679
because it naturally unfolds like that

5752.239 --> 5758.5599999999995
people choose darkness

5755.679 --> 5760.8
his average is out it happens it always

5758.56 --> 5764.639
freaking happens

5760.8 --> 5766.96
you can try to make it all good

5764.639 --> 5768.08
there will be people that will choose

5766.96 --> 5770.32
darkness

5768.08 --> 5771.119
and the more good there is the harder it

5770.32 --> 5773.84
is to be

5771.119 --> 5774.88
dark the more tenacious the more

5773.84 --> 5777.76
secretive

5774.88 --> 5781.52
and the more dangerous the people that

5777.76 --> 5781.52
do choose darkness will become

5782.0 --> 5785.52
this is just the design of it all just

5784.719 --> 5787.199
happens

5785.52 --> 5798.27
it's the free choice there's nothing

5787.199 --> 5801.599999999999
that can be done

5798.27 --> 5805.280000000001
[Music]

5801.6 --> 5808.0
in the sense you can't

5805.28 --> 5808.4
get it out you can't get it out forever

5808.0 --> 5811.28
it's

5808.4 --> 5812.0
it's a it's a esoteric impossibility you

5811.28 --> 5816.32
can never get

5812.0 --> 5820.4
the evil choice part out but you can

5816.32 --> 5823.5199999999995
just try to shine as much wisdom as you

5820.4 --> 5825.759999999999
can and hope people will grab it

5823.52 --> 5826.8
and become when they choose light become

5825.76 --> 5830.8
stronger better

5826.8 --> 5833.360000000001
wiser quicker in order to help against

5830.8 --> 5836.2390000000005
the darkness that will also rise because

5833.36 --> 5836.239
it always does

5838.84 --> 5841.84
right

5848.639 --> 5855.84
you can't know you can't know evil

5852.239 --> 5855.839999999999
or good without evil yeah

5856.96 --> 5861.679
no no well you can know good it just you

5860.639 --> 5863.52
just won't be as

5861.679 --> 5865.4400000000005
conscious of it you won't be able to

5863.52 --> 5869.040000000001
distinguish

5865.44 --> 5871.36
good is normal when you don't know evil

5869.04 --> 5872.8
normal doesn't do much for you it just

5871.36 --> 5878.4
slips you by

5872.8 --> 5878.400000000001
when there's evil then good is much more

5880.84 --> 5883.84
rewarding

5889.6 --> 5897.84
darkness is the container for light that

5893.119 --> 5897.839999999999
that's uh

5898.8 --> 5902.8
i think i get the essence of what you're

5901.199 --> 5906.239
trying to say although calling

5902.8 --> 5911.84
yeah a container no light cannot really

5906.239 --> 5911.839999999999
be contained

5918.8 --> 5927.4400000000005
that's what they want to think

5924.48 --> 5928.4
no darkness is just the contrast of

5927.44 --> 5931.919999999999
light

5928.4 --> 5933.839999999999
you have light you have material and you

5931.92 --> 5938.639
have shadow

5933.84 --> 5941.92
no material no shadow no light no shadow

5938.639 --> 5953.84
light no material no shadow so

5941.92 --> 5953.84
light material shadow right

5960.48 --> 5965.28
no dark no light that's not necessarily

5963.76 --> 5969.1990000000005
true

5965.28 --> 5969.199
without the light there is darkness

5974.159 --> 5977.759999999999
it's a good thing there's always light

5978.0 --> 5982.719
because we have a creator who is the

5992.84 --> 5995.84
light

6010.56 --> 6015.679
the light has no shadows that's an

6012.48 --> 6015.678999999999
interesting way to say it

6015.92 --> 6024.32
right light can only be

6019.199 --> 6037.839999999999
deviated deflected or stopped absorbed

6024.32 --> 6037.84
shadow is just the absence of light

6040.719 --> 6051.84
yeah anyway i'll be back in two minutes

6073.89 --> 6076.979
[Music]

6146.84 --> 6149.84
you

6151.67 --> 6154.8
[Music]

6157.36 --> 6163.839999999999
what why are you bringing this out

6188.84 --> 6191.84
so

6194.48 --> 6200.32
what i've never heard of that one before

6198.4 --> 6204.159
zack sterling

6200.32 --> 6206.48
what trump looks like

6204.159 --> 6208.32
too much like a fire hydrant crossed

6206.48 --> 6219.839999999999
with the tree stump

6208.32 --> 6219.84
what where did you come up with that

6230.84 --> 6233.84
good

6256.4 --> 6262.4
right anyway yeah that's interesting

6259.6 --> 6263.52
good talk lots of esoterics versus

6262.4 --> 6265.5199999999995
exoterics i

6263.52 --> 6267.280000000001
i appreciate that a lot of you really

6265.52 --> 6270.080000000001
got this

6267.28 --> 6271.04
like i could see the chat responding in

6270.08 --> 6273.28
ways that

6271.04 --> 6275.6
yeah prove to me that you actually get

6273.28 --> 6278.159
it and i really appreciate that

6275.6 --> 6279.360000000001
because the exoteric versus esoteric

6278.159 --> 6281.759999999999
thing

6279.36 --> 6284.719
here's here's the weird thing i didn't

6281.76 --> 6284.719
even come up with that

6286.0 --> 6289.6
but when i first came across it it was

6288.159 --> 6292.159
immediately like oh

6289.6 --> 6293.4400000000005
that's it that's the perfect way to do

6292.159 --> 6297.28
it

6293.44 --> 6299.36
because it is counter opposite it is so

6297.28 --> 6301.199
telling and you can learn so much from

6299.36 --> 6301.92
that just looking at it like that exit

6301.199 --> 6305.199
eric recess

6301.92 --> 6306.159
there who was it again it's a conspiracy

6305.199 --> 6308.879999999999
guy

6306.159 --> 6310.4
i don't think he's a flat earther it was

6308.88 --> 6314.4800000000005
like a whole while back

6310.4 --> 6317.839999999999
somebody name dropped it

6314.48 --> 6317.839999999999
and then i looked into it

6318.0 --> 6324.159
i forgot his name terrible

6322.32 --> 6327.599999999999
but that was a guy that's been going for

6324.159 --> 6331.839999999999
a very long time so i hear

6327.6 --> 6331.84
very long time

6332.159 --> 6346.08
does anybody remember

6344.4 --> 6349.36
let me see if i can find it in my

6346.08 --> 6349.36
subscriptions maybe

6349.76 --> 6362.4800000000005
i think i subscribed to him

6359.44 --> 6366.879999999999
my roommate just came back

6362.48 --> 6366.879999999999
it's been very quiet this entire weekend

6368.56 --> 6373.84
because they were all at their parents

6371.04 --> 6373.84
or something or

6398.4 --> 6403.119
now i can't find it or i looked up

6401.84 --> 6415.52
overlooked it

6403.119 --> 6429.839999999999
don't remember

6415.52 --> 6429.84
oh well

6448.14 --> 6451.899
[Music]

6456.159 --> 6460.4
yeah i'm glad you enjoyed it zack

6458.32 --> 6463.84
sterling i yeah as a newcomer

6460.4 --> 6463.839999999999
i do really appreciate you

6466.32 --> 6471.84
you might even get a wrench at some

6468.84 --> 6471.84
point

6476.4 --> 6479.839999999999
i think some others may also at some

6478.88 --> 6482.2390000000005
point deserve it

6479.84 --> 6485.84
it's just the wrenches i hand them out

6482.239 --> 6485.839999999999
in waves

6505.02 --> 6508.149
[Music]

6510.08 --> 6513.84
hey eastenders

6517.199 --> 6520.5599999999995
melbourne yeah how is it over there i

6519.92 --> 6526.0
felt

6520.56 --> 6529.6
i've heard some

6526.0 --> 6532.32
or i haven't heard a lot about australia

6529.6 --> 6534.159000000001
in some time but there was like this

6532.32 --> 6538.84
insane corona crackdown

6534.159 --> 6541.839999999999
compared to other countries so how is it

6538.84 --> 6541.84
there

6546.08 --> 6551.199
not as restricted as you guys anymore

6548.8 --> 6551.1990000000005
really

6552.0 --> 6555.119
you mean in england because in the

6553.84 --> 6557.360000000001
netherlands

6555.119 --> 6559.5199999999995
there is issues but it's really not that

6557.36 --> 6569.839999999999
extreme

6559.52 --> 6569.84
compared to some other places

6580.84 --> 6588.159000000001
hmm

6582.08 --> 6588.159
oh you have bars you lucky bastard

6589.92 --> 6596.0
oh that does sound nice though so they

6593.28 --> 6597.28
they really took the restrictions off

6596.0 --> 6600.159
did they

6597.28 --> 6600.159
i didn't know that

6601.04 --> 6604.08
because last time i heard with melbourne

6602.96 --> 6606.639
like the

6604.08 --> 6607.119
there was like an extreme quarantine

6606.639 --> 6610.4800000000005
that's

6607.119 --> 6613.04
really brutal and they would like

6610.48 --> 6615.28
at almost like attack old ladies and

6613.04 --> 6615.28
stuff

6618.88 --> 6623.1990000000005
not everywhere or it was a victoria

6621.119 --> 6627.199
wasn't it

6623.199 --> 6627.199
but i thought melbourne was also getting

6636.84 --> 6639.84
it

6650.84 --> 6653.84
hmm

6655.199 --> 6658.96
really seeking star wars is las vegas a

6657.52 --> 6662.080000000001
ghost town now

6658.96 --> 6667.84
like for real not not

6662.08 --> 6667.84
literal probably but compared to normal

6670.96 --> 6677.28
but that that in a way

6674.8 --> 6677.92
with stupid you have to quarantine and

6677.28 --> 6681.119
all that

6677.92 --> 6684.639
that does make kind of sense because

6681.119 --> 6687.839999999999
las vegas was really a place to fly

6684.639 --> 6692.0
in have fun and then go back

6687.84 --> 6693.52
and that mechanism is severely blocked

6692.0 --> 6695.04
with the corona measures it's like the

6693.52 --> 6699.119000000001
first big

6695.04 --> 6701.599
victim is quick easy influx

6699.119 --> 6704.0
from far away that's really what it was

6701.599 --> 6706.4800000000005
kind of relying on

6704.0 --> 6708.639
so that does make sense it's very

6706.48 --> 6723.839999999999
unfortunate though

6708.639 --> 6723.84
for people with businesses there

6728.719 --> 6732.32
casinos are open but churches are closed

6731.28 --> 6734.719
oh god

6732.32 --> 6737.199
yeah i heard that it was some time ago

6734.719 --> 6738.96
was this crazy article

6737.199 --> 6740.4
basically explaining that a certain

6738.96 --> 6742.719
church said they were

6740.4 --> 6743.598999999999
a strip club because that way people

6742.719 --> 6745.36
could still

6743.599 --> 6748.400000000001
get into the surface but it just had to

6745.36 --> 6751.679
be officially registered as a strip club

6748.4 --> 6754.08
and then they could open again

6751.679 --> 6755.52
did you guys hear about that it's been

6754.08 --> 6756.5599999999995
out there for like half a year or

6755.52 --> 6760.0
something

6756.56 --> 6761.52
but that happened in america

6760.0 --> 6763.84
because they were trying to force the

6761.52 --> 6766.080000000001
churches closed so they just call it a

6763.84 --> 6768.159000000001
strip club and then open up anyway

6766.08 --> 6770.159
of course they did not have any actual

6768.159 --> 6779.839999999999
strippers

6770.159 --> 6779.839999999999
but yeah you know what i mean

6790.8 --> 6795.84
yeah no don't squirt don't go all

6794.08 --> 6798.8
squirty over that

6795.84 --> 6798.8
but yeah that happened

6798.96 --> 6804.159
it might happen more often it's just

6801.44 --> 6807.04
because the whole corona system is just

6804.159 --> 6808.879999999999
is a big bureaucracy it's like

6807.04 --> 6811.84
bureaucracy decision

6808.88 --> 6812.56
like how do you call something how is it

6811.84 --> 6815.679
registered

6812.56 --> 6818.159000000001
is it essential or not or is it

6815.679 --> 6819.599
whatever it's a bureaucracy mechanism

6818.159 --> 6822.5599999999995
where basically you decide okay

6819.599 --> 6823.52
this one can stay open but those things

6822.56 --> 6825.1990000000005
cannot

6823.52 --> 6827.1990000000005
but then people can work their way

6825.199 --> 6830.4
around it by just okay

6827.199 --> 6832.799999999999
then i'm going to call my business that

6830.4 --> 6833.5199999999995
and then stay open and it works because

6832.8 --> 6836.8
nobody

6833.52 --> 6841.280000000001
really checks that much see

6836.8 --> 6844.2390000000005
it's a giant play bureaucracy game

6841.28 --> 6845.44
in a lot of cases so yeah churches

6844.239 --> 6849.04
calling themselves strip

6845.44 --> 6851.678999999999
clubs it's not surprising

6849.04 --> 6853.5199999999995
anyway i'm rounding out the show so

6851.679 --> 6855.119
