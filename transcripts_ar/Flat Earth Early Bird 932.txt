87.52 --> 92.24
today the weather is a little different

93.6 --> 100.32
it's very windy very cloudy still

97.2 --> 103.92
hasn't been much rain since

100.32 --> 107.03999999999999
last night it's a little warmer i think

103.92 --> 107.04
look up the temperature

110.56 --> 115.759
but yeah i don't know what this is going

114.32 --> 119.67999999999999
to turn into

115.759 --> 119.68
could be more rain could clear up

126.0 --> 129.84
right so

134.239 --> 138.0
all right let's see what's the

140.84 --> 147.84
temperature

143.599 --> 151.2
yeah 18 degrees right

147.84 --> 151.20000000000002
that's not much more

153.92 --> 157.83999999999997
52 humidity

161.84 --> 170.48000000000002
anyway hello tom parker first in chat

165.28 --> 171.92
good to see you

170.48 --> 174.79999999999998
all right good morning for you good

171.92 --> 174.79999999999998
afternoon for me

175.84 --> 199.84
right it is tuesday

180.48 --> 199.83999999999997
the 22nd of june 2021

202.64 --> 213.83999999999997
hmm i don't know i feel a little weird

213.92 --> 217.28
maybe it's because i i don't know went

216.799 --> 221.68
to bed

217.28 --> 221.68
pretty late i really tried not to but

222.48 --> 227.84
but for some reason i did get up earlier

225.12 --> 227.84
pretty early

228.159 --> 231.28
and get me did give me a chance a good

230.319 --> 234.319
chance to

231.28 --> 234.319
start on time though

234.56 --> 243.519
a good servant

241.2 --> 243.51899999999998
right

245.04 --> 254.39999999999998
so my jaw situation feels a lot better

247.84 --> 257.519
so maybe it's because of that

254.4 --> 261.12
usually get after such things are over

257.519 --> 269.84000000000003
i either get a big burst of energy

261.12 --> 269.84000000000003
or get a little more woozy than usual

274.0 --> 280.08
yeah right so i'm i'm just gonna take it

277.44 --> 280.08
easy today

280.56 --> 284.4
and who knows will flow out of it

286.88 --> 292.71999999999997
my verbal control seems to be off

290.24 --> 292.72
a little

293.52 --> 301.84
maybe it'll tighten back up

297.12 --> 301.84000000000003
do my best hey hey tony

302.0 --> 305.039
welcome to the show

307.759 --> 314.40000000000003
right so yesterday

310.96 --> 317.12
flat earth debates again and yeah it was

314.4 --> 317.12
a great show

317.199 --> 321.44
although currently i don't remember much

318.96 --> 321.44
about it

323.68 --> 332.24
mostly what's sticking to mind is

327.12 --> 332.24
uh huey had a numpty clip yesterday

332.88 --> 338.08
about dinosaur bones it was so me me it

336.16 --> 341.199
kind of drove me nuts but there was this

338.08 --> 341.199
one guy in there that

342.16 --> 347.44
had like this really polished british

345.68 --> 353.84000000000003
way of talking but he said something

347.44 --> 353.84
that was so grammatically stupid

354.32 --> 360.08
did uh what was it again i'm forgetting

362.639 --> 370.319
that so that's sticking to mine

366.4 --> 372.56
but well somebody did get in

370.319 --> 374.8
yesterday at flat earth debates and said

372.56 --> 376.8
another really stupid thing

374.8 --> 378.84000000000003
i remember that but i don't know the

376.8 --> 394.639
details about it

378.84 --> 397.039
anymore it'll get back to me

394.639 --> 397.039
come on

401.44 --> 403.759
hmm

407.28 --> 413.35999999999996
okay uh tony i see i i now see your link

414.72 --> 420.96000000000004
that you just posted

418.0 --> 421.44
in skype what is this gregory made yeah

420.96 --> 425.919
i ca

421.44 --> 429.599
dude i can't i can't get in facebook

425.919 --> 429.599
so i can't watch that sorry

431.36 --> 437.84000000000003
hey nathan ugly good to see you

449.28 --> 452.31899999999996
right oh yeah yeah now i remember the

451.199 --> 456.40000000000003
dinosaurs

452.319 --> 460.08000000000004
they are dyed right

456.4 --> 465.67999999999995
sorry for ruining the setup but

460.08 --> 468.87899999999996
took too long but it was so silly

465.68 --> 471.52
it's just like like

468.879 --> 472.96000000000004
that's a type of mistake like our your

471.52 --> 475.28
base belong to us

472.96 --> 478.0
it's it's just that and it becomes

475.28 --> 478.79999999999995
really like weirdly meme sensitive too

478.0 --> 483.68
so

478.8 --> 483.68
yeah chocolate totally was hit by it too

483.919 --> 487.039
and a lot of people by the way mirrored

485.919 --> 490.639
that video

487.039 --> 490.639
a lot of people

491.599 --> 496.24
so that kind of stood out to me as well

494.319 --> 499.03900000000004
hey style in 8012

496.24 --> 499.039
good morning to you

504.639 --> 509.599
yeah the whole dinosaur fossil bone

507.199 --> 512.64
thing was pretty weird

509.599 --> 516.64
it's also odd because i think that

512.64 --> 518.64
thing i remember it like from way back

516.64 --> 521.76
i think i even remember seeing that

518.64 --> 523.8389999999999
original clip

521.76 --> 527.04
where they were saying that and i was

523.839 --> 530.32
super fascinated about it

527.04 --> 533.36
but yeah the the theory because it

530.32 --> 535.6800000000001
yeah to call it fossil light

533.36 --> 537.6
fossilized soft tissue and then it would

535.68 --> 540.56
remain

537.6 --> 541.839
with dissolving with acid like that yeah

540.56 --> 544.8
that makes chemically

541.839 --> 544.8000000000001
very little sense

544.88 --> 549.8389999999999
it's just silly

551.68 --> 557.12
but when i saw it way back then

555.279 --> 559.68
if it was even in the real physical

557.12 --> 561.519
world who knows man

559.68 --> 563.8389999999999
i just thought like but what if that's

561.519 --> 563.839
like

565.519 --> 570.24
some unique element to these dinosaurs

568.88 --> 572.48
which i still believed

570.24 --> 574.64
could have been possible in some way for

572.48 --> 577.08
some reason

574.64 --> 578.399
pretty much any reason except what

577.08 --> 580.48
archaeologists

578.399 --> 581.68
the mainstream archaeologists story

580.48 --> 585.76
about it is

581.68 --> 589.12
this is that's what i thought back then

585.76 --> 593.12
but yeah why hasn't

589.12 --> 593.12
science called out that kind of nonsense

602.88 --> 607.04
well yeah

608.16 --> 619.8389999999999
why don't they i don't know it's it's

611.2 --> 619.839
not on the radar

624.56 --> 628.2399999999999
i don't know the only logical reason

626.959 --> 630.0
that i can think of is that

628.24 --> 632.0790000000001
people that would understand in the

630.0 --> 633.6
field that that's complete nonsense

632.079 --> 635.1999999999999
they don't want to have anything to do

633.6 --> 635.839
with it because they feel it's like a

635.2 --> 640.48
trap

635.839 --> 640.48
or something right

642.399 --> 646.0
i think that a lot of people probably

644.24 --> 646.48
know that it's complete nonsense and

646.0 --> 648.64
that

646.48 --> 649.839
they're just holding their tongue about

648.64 --> 652.399
it

649.839 --> 652.399
out there

655.76 --> 662.88
and when people call each out

659.12 --> 665.279
for science then hey

662.88 --> 667.04
hello stop trafficking arrest that not

665.279 --> 671.2
here to cause trouble

667.04 --> 671.1999999999999
okay that's all right

671.36 --> 678.88
welcome back uh

675.76 --> 680.64
right so when people in the field out

678.88 --> 683.8389999999999
there call people out for sites you

680.64 --> 683.8389999999999
gotta figure out like

684.48 --> 689.839
what's the reason behind the inquiry

690.399 --> 695.6
except for that it is faulty and that it

693.12 --> 697.839
would become inquiry worthy like why do

695.6 --> 701.2
people engage in

697.839 --> 702.8000000000001
such things officially and in other

701.2 --> 705.76
cases they don't

702.8 --> 708.7199999999999
you just gotta know why why they did it

705.76 --> 708.72
the other reasons

711.68 --> 718.079
and maybe it should be considered since

715.68 --> 720.079
it's become kind of consensus based out

718.079 --> 721.4399999999999
there it's just these rules that they've

720.079 --> 725.04
built up

721.44 --> 728.1600000000001
built up that calling

725.04 --> 733.12
others out for the science

728.16 --> 733.12
is not so much scientific like

733.6 --> 737.44
it's not really a scientific inquiry

735.68 --> 738.4799999999999
it's not like okay i'm gonna test it to

737.44 --> 741.839
see if it's faulty

738.48 --> 741.839
per default immediately

742.079 --> 749.68
it's become a political tool

746.079 --> 749.68
for the consensus machine

749.76 --> 753.279
for the ranks right

756.0 --> 760.0
and if you don't understand like how

757.839 --> 761.2
those group dynamics work and what their

760.0 --> 764.32
real plan is what

761.2 --> 765.9200000000001
what the the the rules of the group are

764.32 --> 770.72
what narratives

765.92 --> 775.36
they wield and how then

770.72 --> 778.1600000000001
then maybe some good insight on yeah

775.36 --> 780.639
what their plan behind their actions

778.16 --> 780.639
really is

782.72 --> 786.72
who they perceive as their real

784.839 --> 789.0400000000001
opponents

786.72 --> 789.0400000000001
anyway

795.6 --> 801.839
hello nigel arnold

812.839 --> 815.839
hmm

826.839 --> 829.839
uh

836.0 --> 840.079
all right so nigel arnold

840.24 --> 845.76
you think that religion has caused more

842.56 --> 848.2399999999999
damage than pseudoscience

845.76 --> 850.48
could you give an a specific example for

848.24 --> 850.48
that

850.88 --> 854.079
and then actually look at the real

853.199 --> 856.4799999999999
causes

854.079 --> 858.4799999999999
for the damage right how that

856.48 --> 861.6800000000001
mechanically happens

858.48 --> 864.24
where religion following a religion

861.68 --> 864.2399999999999
did that

866.32 --> 870.639
versus where basically things were

868.56 --> 873.68
claimed to do something

870.639 --> 877.44
which was just blatantly wrong

873.68 --> 877.4399999999999
and then that caused damage

878.399 --> 881.44
when we try to

881.76 --> 888.0
roughly feel out what the skills are

885.6 --> 888.0
between

893.44 --> 897.519
right you you could equate it

897.68 --> 903.76
if to get a little bit more ethereal

900.16 --> 903.76
weighing the difference between

904.72 --> 909.279
gambling on false information

909.68 --> 917.279
versus gambling on following

913.76 --> 921.04
principles of a religion and going by

917.279 --> 923.76
not fully informed standards

921.04 --> 927.12
right let's weigh them out which one

923.76 --> 930.24
causes more damage

927.12 --> 933.68
ever seriously thought about it

930.24 --> 935.839
because in religion you know when things

933.68 --> 937.4399999999999
related to religion like the crusades or

935.839 --> 940.32
whatever

937.44 --> 942.8800000000001
like what is really causing the damage

940.32 --> 945.44
is it the people

942.88 --> 948.56
like really doing the best to follow the

945.44 --> 951.2790000000001
codes that have been given to them

948.56 --> 951.279
or is it

952.16 --> 959.92
i don't know the people that

956.72 --> 961.279
basically know it's a there's ruses

959.92 --> 964.199
about it that are

961.279 --> 965.8389999999999
literally just being psychopathic

964.199 --> 969.199
manipulating

965.839 --> 971.2790000000001
religious people to do

969.199 --> 972.24
real damage like who is doing the real

971.279 --> 975.12
damage

972.24 --> 978.8
is it the misinformation or is it the

975.12 --> 981.12
people dedicated to a religion

978.8 --> 983.8389999999999
yeah and now you can equate that even to

981.12 --> 983.839
modern times

990.8 --> 996.079
right although yeah misinformation is a

993.839 --> 998.8000000000001
little bit of an over generation

996.079 --> 1000.0
generalization to compare with

998.8 --> 1004.24
pseudoscience

1000.0 --> 1008.24
but yeah it's a it's a rough comparison

1004.24 --> 1008.24
but it's good enough for the example i

1008.839 --> 1025.839
think

1010.639 --> 1025.839
all right make your wars

1027.199 --> 1034.64
all right so nigel can you

1030.48 --> 1036.72
let's just say past few centuries right

1034.64 --> 1038.24
let's not go to medieval times because

1036.72 --> 1041.3600000000001
that was just

1038.24 --> 1045.439
yeah over the top but

1041.36 --> 1048.3999999999999
could go there so in these

1045.439 --> 1048.4
major wars

1048.96 --> 1054.24
that you say are rooted in religion what

1051.919 --> 1056.5590000000002
exactly about

1054.24 --> 1058.72
the religion and the teachings of the

1056.559 --> 1063.36
religion

1058.72 --> 1081.84
have played a part in causing the damage

1063.36 --> 1081.84
done within those wars specifically

1097.63 --> 1100.719
[Music]

1105.84 --> 1113.76
because i think in reality

1110.4 --> 1118.3200000000002
most cases when religion

1113.76 --> 1122.72
is like a partial driving force in a war

1118.32 --> 1125.9189999999999
it's usually not following

1122.72 --> 1128.4
the religion that effectively does the

1125.919 --> 1128.4
damage

1133.76 --> 1141.679
right so it's usually the control

1138.0 --> 1147.039
or the the lack of control

1141.679 --> 1147.039
over the spirit of others

1147.36 --> 1152.4799999999998
right in your religion that would make

1150.799 --> 1155.9189999999999
them kind of like falter

1152.48 --> 1157.52
and then cause that damage like it would

1155.919 --> 1160.64
be a sign that the religion

1157.52 --> 1162.799
is not fully under control

1160.64 --> 1164.64
right so is it then the religion that

1162.799 --> 1166.96
does the damage

1164.64 --> 1169.2800000000002
or is it the faltering of the religion

1166.96 --> 1172.0
that does the damage right

1169.28 --> 1173.6
yeah i i'm taking this really freaking

1172.0 --> 1176.08
serious i bet you've never

1173.6 --> 1177.84
considered thinking like that about it

1176.08 --> 1178.1599999999999
did unite you arnold when you brought

1177.84 --> 1180.32
that

1178.16 --> 1180.3200000000002
up

1183.76 --> 1187.919
you thought it was just an o and a one

1185.84 --> 1190.84
didn't you

1187.919 --> 1193.8400000000001
and now i'm showing you the true fractal

1190.84 --> 1193.84
implication

1196.88 --> 1200.64
don't know if you're following it right

1198.64 --> 1202.88
now but you might watch back

1200.64 --> 1207.8400000000001
and consider it again what i've said in

1202.88 --> 1207.8400000000001
the order that i did

1233.2 --> 1237.3600000000001
hey gaining wisdom good to see you man

1239.36 --> 1245.84
did you just follow my uh

1242.4 --> 1250.64
well the layout

1245.84 --> 1254.0
a question is it really the religion

1250.64 --> 1256.7990000000002
that does damage or is it the faltering

1254.0 --> 1256.799
of the religion

1257.2 --> 1263.919
that causes the damage you know

1260.96 --> 1266.24
religion is all about just following the

1263.919 --> 1269.2800000000002
rules

1266.24 --> 1271.2
and priests assigned to help you follow

1269.28 --> 1273.039
the rules and then you follow them you

1271.2 --> 1274.159
might not be all too familiar with the

1273.039 --> 1278.32
rules so you just

1274.159 --> 1280.96
trust them right that's

1278.32 --> 1280.96
the problem

1281.36 --> 1285.12
eventually that's like the set up

1283.52 --> 1288.1589999999999
problem for priesthood

1285.12 --> 1288.1589999999999
christ knew this

1288.32 --> 1292.559
that's why i always said like you have

1290.24 --> 1295.44
to have that connection

1292.559 --> 1296.8799999999999
you have to know the rules you have to

1295.44 --> 1300.0
feel them

1296.88 --> 1302.0800000000002
you have to recognize them

1300.0 --> 1303.52
so in a religion if there's a very big

1302.08 --> 1305.6
group and a lot of people

1303.52 --> 1307.76
like professions their own focus of

1305.6 --> 1310.3999999999999
professional soldiers whatever

1307.76 --> 1313.679
they might not be all that talented

1310.4 --> 1316.96
keeping track of all the spiritual rules

1313.679 --> 1319.679
by the religion and so they are

1316.96 --> 1322.08
provided for by priests that are more

1319.679 --> 1325.76
specialized in that yeah but

1322.08 --> 1330.08
they are people too they can fall

1325.76 --> 1330.84
they can be seduced by power or by money

1330.08 --> 1333.52
or

1330.84 --> 1338.32
anything

1333.52 --> 1341.2
and then yeah basically a religious

1338.32 --> 1342.32
preacher a potentially good one a

1341.2 --> 1345.3600000000001
talented one gets

1342.32 --> 1347.6
grabbled as they say becomes corrupted

1345.36 --> 1350.7199999999998
and then everybody under him they might

1347.6 --> 1352.9599999999998
not really catch on they might even

1350.72 --> 1354.64
first feel like there's something weird

1352.96 --> 1355.28
but they're just too focused on what

1354.64 --> 1360.3200000000002
they do

1355.28 --> 1363.52
so they don't see the sneaky plan

1360.32 --> 1364.32
and then they get lured into doing

1363.52 --> 1367.28
damage

1364.32 --> 1369.52
causing some something terrible perhaps

1367.28 --> 1372.48
as some kind of political pretext

1369.52 --> 1375.84
you you know how this goes your movies

1372.48 --> 1375.84
show you this all the time

1376.24 --> 1379.76
so is it really then the religion that

1378.159 --> 1382.3200000000002
did the damage or is it

1379.76 --> 1389.84
the corruption the faltering that did

1382.32 --> 1389.84
the damage

1400.88 --> 1406.5590000000002
well yes nigel arnold but if catholics

1404.24 --> 1410.96
and protestants

1406.559 --> 1410.96
fight wars like that

1411.039 --> 1414.64
it's not because of beliefs and

1412.64 --> 1417.1200000000001
disbeliefs it's because of

1414.64 --> 1419.919
priesthood power it's because of

1417.12 --> 1419.9189999999999
authority

1422.559 --> 1431.6
right it's like political power

1427.919 --> 1435.3600000000001
so that is just power struggle

1431.6 --> 1438.6399999999999
that's not looked upon

1435.36 --> 1442.08
very well

1438.64 --> 1446.3200000000002
by christ if you know what i mean

1442.08 --> 1449.039
so was it really the religion

1446.32 --> 1450.48
that did the damage or was it the

1449.039 --> 1453.76
faltering

1450.48 --> 1458.72
the not following the rules

1453.76 --> 1461.2
of the people within those orders

1458.72 --> 1463.1200000000001
being bound by consensus being power

1461.2 --> 1464.64
like yeah we need to keep the power

1463.12 --> 1465.4399999999998
because we're scared that we might

1464.64 --> 1468.159
perish

1465.44 --> 1469.679
right might start out really simple it's

1468.159 --> 1472.159
a faltering

1469.679 --> 1475.76
it's a corruption and they got bound by

1472.159 --> 1479.679
it so it's the faltering of the religion

1475.76 --> 1481.2
then that ended up causing the war

1479.679 --> 1483.2
because they were scared they were

1481.2 --> 1484.799
scared of losing power and not just

1483.2 --> 1489.44
scared of god

1484.799 --> 1490.0
as is said to do is is warned about my

1489.44 --> 1495.279
christ

1490.0 --> 1500.0
see it oh oh you don't believe it oh

1495.279 --> 1502.32
okay okay nigel arnold well yeah

1500.0 --> 1505.279
well if if you're not willing to even

1502.32 --> 1508.72
seriously look into it like that

1505.279 --> 1515.84
then yeah

1508.72 --> 1515.84
can't help you

1522.08 --> 1528.559
what do you think getting wisdom

1525.44 --> 1543.8400000000001
i value your opinion about that

1528.559 --> 1543.84
what i said

1554.84 --> 1557.84
so

1568.84 --> 1571.84
so

1573.52 --> 1576.799
how can they argue something so

1575.2 --> 1579.919
fundamental to their faith

1576.799 --> 1579.9189999999999
well sleeping warrior

1581.36 --> 1588.799
you're supposed to do that it's

1585.12 --> 1592.08
trying to figure out the truth

1588.799 --> 1596.84
the truth it's all about understanding

1592.08 --> 1600.8799999999999
figuring out the truth so yes

1596.84 --> 1604.9599999999998
endless debating endless

1600.88 --> 1604.96
attempts and squabble

1605.919 --> 1609.2
because everybody's trying to figure out

1608.08 --> 1612.0
the truth and

1609.2 --> 1612.48
facing their own their own faults and

1612.0 --> 1615.919
their

1612.48 --> 1618.4
errors and it's the challenge it's

1615.919 --> 1618.4
seeking

1619.279 --> 1624.08
it's like a spiritual arena and that's

1622.48 --> 1626.4
what happens

1624.08 --> 1630.48
that's how you can keep yourself sharp

1626.4 --> 1635.279
it's basically what we do in our own way

1630.48 --> 1635.279
with flat earth versus clovers

1637.76 --> 1640.96
right so you're not supposed to go to

1639.6 --> 1643.1999999999998
war over that

1640.96 --> 1644.48
if you do that then it's because of

1643.2 --> 1646.32
power

1644.48 --> 1648.08
it's because of some authority you want

1646.32 --> 1651.12
to impose something

1648.08 --> 1656.08
well that's not

1651.12 --> 1656.08
what the bible says you should do is

1656.559 --> 1668.799
see so it becomes about political

1660.0 --> 1669.2
situations power now if you don't do

1668.799 --> 1671.039
that

1669.2 --> 1673.039
then yeah you're going to just debate

1671.039 --> 1674.72
and debate and debate and everybody

1673.039 --> 1676.1589999999999
there will be books probably and there

1674.72 --> 1679.52
is so much of this

1676.159 --> 1682.7990000000002
right from within the context

1679.52 --> 1684.6399999999999
of the beliefs

1682.799 --> 1686.8799999999999
there's just a lot of developments a lot

1684.64 --> 1689.8400000000001
of people dedicate their lives to

1686.88 --> 1692.0800000000002
figure yeah arguing a certain principle

1689.84 --> 1692.08
or

1693.52 --> 1697.039
finding archaeological evidence to back

1696.72 --> 1700.559
up

1697.039 --> 1700.559
something that was argued

1707.52 --> 1711.84
hello agm good to see you

1745.36 --> 1754.559
oh god okay well nigel arnold

1750.24 --> 1757.039
look jehovah's witnesses

1754.559 --> 1758.1589999999999
yeah they're they're not very christian

1757.039 --> 1761.2
really

1758.159 --> 1763.279
in my opinion they're they're more like

1761.2 --> 1763.279
a

1763.48 --> 1768.159
christ-flavored cult sorry

1768.559 --> 1772.96
that insults you you probably heard

1770.96 --> 1774.159
every like and the problem is that in a

1772.96 --> 1775.8400000000001
way they kind of know it

1774.159 --> 1778.3990000000001
and so they just choose to ignore

1775.84 --> 1778.399
everything

1778.88 --> 1783.2
if it conflicts with their with their

1781.279 --> 1786.48
belief indoctrination

1783.2 --> 1786.48
more it's more like it

1787.12 --> 1794.8799999999999
so don't hate them though i've went

1791.44 --> 1797.6000000000001
into i've like tried it out

1794.88 --> 1798.7990000000002
not like converting but like i let them

1797.6 --> 1801.279
in my house

1798.799 --> 1802.1589999999999
and then i would i would even reflect

1801.279 --> 1804.799
upon

1802.159 --> 1805.5200000000002
i threw like but what if jesus didn't

1804.799 --> 1810.08
die

1805.52 --> 1812.399
on jehovah's like was it the 2008

1810.08 --> 1814.24
and they absolutely had no idea what to

1812.399 --> 1816.32
think about they weren't like scared or

1814.24 --> 1819.1200000000001
anything they were just like what

1816.32 --> 1819.12
what's going on

1821.12 --> 1823.84
but

1824.88 --> 1831.5200000000002
yeah to sit to equate all religions with

1828.08 --> 1837.84
how jehovah's witnesses are

1831.52 --> 1837.84
yeah that's it's not really fair

1841.52 --> 1848.32
yeah no non-medical intervention

1845.279 --> 1853.84
right religiously right

1848.32 --> 1853.84
that's yeah they do that i know

1861.6 --> 1865.84
okay okay that's good

1871.039 --> 1876.84
yeah not equating our religions to

1872.88 --> 1879.8400000000001
jehovah's witnesses that's good nigel

1876.84 --> 1879.84
arnold

1883.679 --> 1889.039
they reject the trinity jehovah's

1885.6 --> 1889.039
witnesses oh good for them

1890.84 --> 1894.8799999999999
right it

1892.88 --> 1898.24
you know what in in ways with the

1894.88 --> 1898.24
jehovah's witnesses right

1899.039 --> 1902.64
the only real serious problem that i

1901.679 --> 1906.5590000000002
feel about them

1902.64 --> 1908.5590000000002
is is their indoctrination system

1906.559 --> 1910.08
it's like that they really condition

1908.559 --> 1913.76
each other

1910.08 --> 1916.399
right that part i find very troublesome

1913.76 --> 1918.96
and basically for somebody like me

1916.399 --> 1922.1589999999999
completely inacceptable it's like

1918.96 --> 1924.96
no way in hell ever

1922.159 --> 1925.279
would i convert to such a thing ever

1924.96 --> 1927.039
it's

1925.279 --> 1929.6
totally conflicting with everything i

1927.039 --> 1929.6
stand for

1931.44 --> 1938.48
but if they didn't have that

1935.2 --> 1940.799
then well guess what it would probably

1938.48 --> 1944.559
develop

1940.799 --> 1948.8799999999999
and refine and it might have

1944.559 --> 1951.44
become very interesting

1948.88 --> 1953.2
but yeah that because of their format

1951.44 --> 1954.24
it's just not gonna happen they're just

1953.2 --> 1959.519
gonna stop to

1954.24 --> 1959.519
stick to this until they all go nuts

1959.6 --> 1965.039
so whatever i don't know maybe they got

1961.679 --> 1967.039
some weird secret things

1965.039 --> 1970.24
prophecies or whatever i don't know man

1967.039 --> 1970.24
i don't know enough about him

1971.519 --> 1980.32
uh hey julio papin good to see you

1977.12 --> 1991.84
well yeah agm is good on him

1980.32 --> 1991.84
because it is ridiculous to believe that

1993.39 --> 1996.479
[Music]

1998.08 --> 2002.1589999999999
right or or rather it's not even

2000.399 --> 2006.0
ridiculous to believe that

2002.159 --> 2009.2
the trinity it's ridiculous to believe

2006.0 --> 2011.679
that it's that important that

2009.2 --> 2013.279
in my opinion is the the most ridiculous

2011.679 --> 2018.88
thing about it

2013.279 --> 2022.24
is that people hang so much weight on it

2018.88 --> 2023.0390000000002
everything like nothing makes sense

2022.24 --> 2028.08
unless that

2023.039 --> 2028.08
even though yeah why why

2028.799 --> 2037.9189999999999
anybody ever given like a cohesive

2033.6 --> 2040.8799999999999
logically consistent reason

2037.919 --> 2042.159
or is it just like oh panic mode it's

2040.88 --> 2046.88
doom

2042.159 --> 2061.44
nothing makes any sense so solve system

2046.88 --> 2075.839
right think about that

2061.44 --> 2075.839
all right

2093.679 --> 2096.399
nothing eh

2101.44 --> 2105.04
did i make you all think

2110.0 --> 2113.599
i do that sometimes i know

2114.16 --> 2117.839
stills little confusing

2117.92 --> 2121.599
not entirely sure like okay i either

2120.56 --> 2125.92
really made them

2121.599 --> 2131.839
think or they're really bored

2125.92 --> 2131.839
i'm not sure

2145.28 --> 2159.8390000000004
i'm just gonna take it on the first one

2164.88 --> 2169.599
right so anyway yeah the question still

2166.96 --> 2172.7200000000003
stands nigel arnold and two others who

2169.599 --> 2175.28
who would consider

2172.72 --> 2177.1189999999997
engaging potentially answering my

2175.28 --> 2180.5600000000004
question

2177.119 --> 2183.76
does the religion actually do

2180.56 --> 2186.7999999999997
the damage like

2183.76 --> 2190.5600000000004
just imagine if that religion would

2186.8 --> 2191.28
would not exist and there would be some

2190.56 --> 2194.48
other

2191.28 --> 2201.8390000000004
format that would drive

2194.48 --> 2201.839
these people to do their thing

2202.079 --> 2208.88
it yeah it's like okay

2205.28 --> 2209.52
interchange there's like a religiously

2208.88 --> 2215.839
driven

2209.52 --> 2215.839
group or just a politically driven group

2217.119 --> 2222.56
which one will likely do more damage

2226.079 --> 2230.2400000000002
right because politics drives people to

2229.2 --> 2233.52
basically do

2230.24 --> 2236.56
whatever they dare or could get away

2233.52 --> 2242.079
with in order to achieve their goal

2236.56 --> 2245.119
whatever it may be a religion

2242.079 --> 2246.96
officially is driven by upholding the

2245.119 --> 2250.2400000000002
principles and then trying to

2246.96 --> 2253.359
attain strength and

2250.24 --> 2256.16
power from within

2253.359 --> 2256.88
and then people of course also falter

2256.16 --> 2260.96
and like

2256.88 --> 2260.96
take it too far trick others

2262.24 --> 2267.04
so but yeah then they technically step

2264.56 --> 2270.7999999999997
outside of the religion it's almost like

2267.04 --> 2273.2
an unfortunate side effect of that power

2270.8 --> 2275.04
and the seduction that comes with it

2273.2 --> 2276.7999999999997
right and the political group of course

2275.04 --> 2279.2
is going to be subjected to power

2276.8 --> 2281.599
seduction constantly

2279.2 --> 2283.2
they count on it and that's why they get

2281.599 --> 2285.839
so grabbly

2283.2 --> 2285.839
so

2294.4 --> 2303.44
are you just born into the religion

2299.76 --> 2303.44
right well that technically

2305.52 --> 2313.839
what's so bad about it

2315.28 --> 2319.0400000000004
i'm not talking about like messed up

2318.24 --> 2322.3999999999996
religions

2319.04 --> 2325.44
that are yeah evil [ __ ]

2322.4 --> 2329.76
like really like not old

2325.44 --> 2329.76
yeah you know what i mean uh

2334.16 --> 2346.3999999999996
inherit the hate

2341.839 --> 2349.599
right but but that's like a curse

2346.4 --> 2354.48
right it's like a generational

2349.599 --> 2356.88
cultural curse such hatred

2354.48 --> 2357.52
on the other hand you don't really and

2356.88 --> 2360.7200000000003
yeah

2357.52 --> 2363.92
some of the hatred may have just a

2360.72 --> 2367.5989999999997
very specific societal function

2363.92 --> 2370.96
like a cultural function as well

2367.599 --> 2370.96
to in a way protect them

2373.68 --> 2378.0789999999997
but yeah it's it's difficult man

2378.16 --> 2380.56
let's see

2381.68 --> 2384.24
right because

2386.32 --> 2393.44
like hatred is recognized

2389.92 --> 2396.64
in islam and hatred

2393.44 --> 2399.2000000000003
is not like through

2396.64 --> 2401.04
the divine standard through basically

2399.2 --> 2404.319
the god's laws

2401.04 --> 2407.44
hatred is not good right it's sometimes

2404.319 --> 2410.0
explained and can't be justified but

2407.44 --> 2411.599
in itself it's not something that that

2410.0 --> 2414.4
is

2411.599 --> 2414.4
recommended

2417.92 --> 2425.28
right actions may sometimes be

2422.839 --> 2431.04
recommended

2425.28 --> 2431.0400000000004
but hatred itself to be driven by it

2431.92 --> 2434.7200000000003
i don't think so

2436.4 --> 2442.1600000000003
so that would be yeah big mistake that's

2439.44 --> 2442.16
how i see it

2442.56 --> 2453.839
they've been grappled in a way

2465.04 --> 2467.839
right

2481.359 --> 2485.7599999999998
right because it is it is like a a

2484.56 --> 2490.0789999999997
family thing

2485.76 --> 2490.079
rather you know that's like a family

2492.839 --> 2499.44
thing

2495.68 --> 2502.72
it's like scapegoat spell binding

2499.44 --> 2502.7200000000003
designate an enemy

2503.76 --> 2507.76
and then keep chanting it keep pouring

2506.48 --> 2511.359
that into your

2507.76 --> 2513.28
young ones and then reward them if they

2511.359 --> 2514.48
comply with it and make it their own

2513.28 --> 2517.52
right

2514.48 --> 2519.04
that's like a spell i did i don't think

2517.52 --> 2521.44
that the religion

2519.04 --> 2524.079
that you can find anything in any

2521.44 --> 2524.079
scripture

2524.8 --> 2533.119
of any sort i think

2527.839 --> 2533.119
where that is like literally encouraged

2533.76 --> 2537.8390000000004
and he recognized religious scripture

2540.56 --> 2544.56
can people be consumed by religion well

2542.8 --> 2545.76
they can get obsessed with it nigel

2544.56 --> 2550.0
arnold that's for sure

2545.76 --> 2565.8390000000004
absolutely and obsession always consumes

2550.0 --> 2565.839
you so yes

2576.839 --> 2579.839
so

2596.64 --> 2607.839
that consumption is where you think the

2599.04 --> 2607.839
problem starts

2610.72 --> 2612.9599999999996
no

2616.319 --> 2620.079
look if somebody just goes insane and

2618.72 --> 2623.52
they let themselves get

2620.079 --> 2625.119
guided by religious delusions which

2623.52 --> 2626.96
would be delusions because

2625.119 --> 2629.28
they're incomplete they're not actually

2626.96 --> 2630.88
in the delusion truly following what

2629.28 --> 2632.4
they should be doing

2630.88 --> 2635.599
they're delusional when they're like

2632.4 --> 2637.92
that right yeah that could do damage

2635.599 --> 2640.7200000000003
but guess what a person that would go

2637.92 --> 2643.44
delusional to that level

2640.72 --> 2644.24
they'd go delusional anyway even if they

2643.44 --> 2647.359
would never

2644.24 --> 2649.2
have heard about that religion they

2647.359 --> 2652.319
would find another way to go

2649.2 --> 2654.96
insane because yeah

2652.319 --> 2656.079
it's not literally the cause it's just

2654.96 --> 2659.44
the form

2656.079 --> 2663.8390000000004
in which it becomes expressed

2659.44 --> 2663.839
when that happens

2674.839 --> 2677.839
right

2678.079 --> 2682.48
so the real problem with religion is

2683.92 --> 2691.839
the where it starts is when it becomes

2687.04 --> 2691.839
successful and it stabilizes everything

2692.0 --> 2699.04
because then grabblers get very much

2695.52 --> 2699.04
seduced to move in

2699.119 --> 2705.52
or corrupt on the spot

2702.319 --> 2709.119
and try to start scheming again

2705.52 --> 2712.24
right that's the universal

2709.119 --> 2713.119
first step problem of any religion is

2712.24 --> 2715.7599999999998
when it first

2713.119 --> 2716.56
really gets off the ground starts to get

2715.76 --> 2720.48
success

2716.56 --> 2720.48
the grabblers start to get yeah

2721.44 --> 2724.64
that's the problem

2726.16 --> 2732.0
that's that's the first one

2729.2 --> 2732.56
yeah making it sound funny but it's it's

2732.0 --> 2734.319
really

2732.56 --> 2736.72
actually kind of bothersome that that

2734.319 --> 2736.72
happens

2738.8 --> 2747.8390000000004
but that's just how this realm works

2740.88 --> 2747.839
those are the rules

2758.16 --> 2763.92
oh good servant that's

2761.44 --> 2765.2000000000003
an interesting idea but if the

2763.92 --> 2767.28
politicians would

2765.2 --> 2769.2
actually be god-fearing then they would

2767.28 --> 2775.8390000000004
never

2769.2 --> 2775.839
be able to maneuver to their position

2786.839 --> 2789.839
right

2806.56 --> 2809.839
hate it's low iq

2810.16 --> 2814.64
well a low iq certainly doesn't help if

2813.2 --> 2818.319
you're also

2814.64 --> 2818.319
viable to hatred yeah

2819.599 --> 2823.599
it becomes is much harder to get out of

2828.839 --> 2831.839
it

2852.8 --> 2857.599
right but yeah tear it 306 it could

2855.92 --> 2861.359
definitely be

2857.599 --> 2861.92
considered that pakistan and india are

2861.359 --> 2867.359
having

2861.92 --> 2867.359
like a are basically using each other

2868.16 --> 2875.2
as a sort of feudal scheme

2871.68 --> 2877.9199999999996
as is in the old times by the way

2875.2 --> 2879.1189999999997
this has never really ended they just

2877.92 --> 2882.16
use each other as

2879.119 --> 2882.6400000000003
as a regular target as a scapegoat to

2882.16 --> 2886.3999999999996
attain

2882.64 --> 2888.72
political power

2886.4 --> 2890.64
of their country so they're both like

2888.72 --> 2895.04
yeah we need an opponent okay we

2890.64 --> 2897.7599999999998
we're just gonna keep on boxing

2895.04 --> 2898.8
and then yeah get serious and war

2897.76 --> 2900.559
bloodshed and then

2898.8 --> 2902.48
okay it's peaceful again okay and all

2900.559 --> 2906.88
right got another situation

2902.48 --> 2915.839
okay let's poke the other side again

2906.88 --> 2915.839
right and that's just how it goes

2922.0 --> 2926.559
despise i like you right good point

2925.04 --> 2929.839
there rest ahead

2926.559 --> 2929.8390000000004
you're right

2945.839 --> 2948.96
because of their religion

2949.599 --> 2956.0
right but then the religious leaders

2952.96 --> 2960.319
are effectively

2956.0 --> 2960.319
well playing religious politics

2960.4 --> 2965.04
right so it is kind of the same thing it

2964.64 --> 2971.839
just

2965.04 --> 2971.839
comes through the religious speeches

2996.839 --> 2999.839
what

3000.0 --> 3012.16
what talking to sleeping warrior

3004.48 --> 3015.28
where is he hasn't spoken up for a while

3012.16 --> 3018.48
oh right he asked if he's a bogey no

3015.28 --> 3027.8390000000004
there's no bogies here if there's bogies

3018.48 --> 3027.839
in my chat i will take care of it

3038.839 --> 3041.839
so

3043.839 --> 3055.839
yes tara 306 yes you're right

3046.88 --> 3055.839
it is obs

3066.839 --> 3069.839
uh

3079.359 --> 3083.839
hinduism religion

3087.359 --> 3090.319
what is that even

3091.2 --> 3097.04
what do you mean terror 306

3094.96 --> 3099.76
now i'm curious what you mean by that

3097.04 --> 3103.52
hinduism religion

3099.76 --> 3103.5200000000004
was created recently

3103.839 --> 3111.52
oh really nigel arnold

3107.28 --> 3113.599
thank you i appreciate that

3111.52 --> 3116.319
and thank you for the well the good

3113.599 --> 3116.319
conversation

3117.359 --> 3125.839
you did kind of inspire me to yeah

3121.359 --> 3125.839
to attain a subject hold on

3147.92 --> 3153.839
come on

3161.44 --> 3163.76
okay

3165.28 --> 3168.4
wrong email right i didn't receive

3167.44 --> 3170.559
anything just yet

3168.4 --> 3170.559
but

3172.96 --> 3179.2
oh by the way also paul connell

3176.0 --> 3180.88
if you're listening outside of the show

3179.2 --> 3184.48
he also sent me a paypal

3180.88 --> 3186.559
so thank you very much for that

3184.48 --> 3188.4
thanks for your support in the in the

3186.559 --> 3195.8390000000004
chat over at flat earth debates very

3188.4 --> 3195.839
enthusiastic cool guy

3206.839 --> 3209.839
so

3220.839 --> 3223.839
hmm

3238.559 --> 3241.599
it is the oldest

3242.079 --> 3246.8
right that's what i thought as well on

3244.48 --> 3248.64
the surface right about hinduism it's

3246.8 --> 3252.48
the oldest religion

3248.64 --> 3255.68
but maybe it's slightly different maybe

3252.48 --> 3260.559
it has like the oldest

3255.68 --> 3264.319
known writings that have ever been found

3260.559 --> 3267.44
and much later

3264.319 --> 3270.96
there might be yeah

3267.44 --> 3273.119
where the actual religion starts

3270.96 --> 3274.96
we're actually sort of like like more in

3273.119 --> 3276.4
the directions of like this is

3274.96 --> 3277.92
this is what you're supposed to do

3276.4 --> 3279.76
within the religion this is what the

3277.92 --> 3284.799
priesthood is supposed to do

3279.76 --> 3284.7990000000004
i don't know i'm guessing i don't know

3290.839 --> 3293.839
this

3304.839 --> 3311.7599999999998
brahmanism

3307.839 --> 3311.7599999999998
or is it ramen

3315.28 --> 3325.28
this guy

3320.079 --> 3325.28
that's bremen he has a lot of heads

3327.359 --> 3335.839
and a lot of hands

3337.52 --> 3345.839
does germanism count what no

3341.68 --> 3345.839
okay check my paypal now sure

3347.44 --> 3363.839
ah yeah i got it thanks dude

3351.52 --> 3363.839
i appreciate that

3370.64 --> 3378.8799999999997
that's nice

3376.799 --> 3379.839
why i don't have 10 times more people in

3378.88 --> 3390.48
my chat

3379.839 --> 3392.4
i don't know

3390.48 --> 3394.96
maybe it's just because of the way that

3392.4 --> 3398.48
i am right now you guys

3394.96 --> 3401.04
kind of know how to deal with that

3398.48 --> 3402.0
but maybe there's like a whole range of

3401.04 --> 3404.0
characters that

3402.0 --> 3406.16
literally don't know how to compose

3404.0 --> 3408.319
themselves in the face of the way that i

3406.16 --> 3411.7599999999998
am

3408.319 --> 3415.2799999999997
they're kind of scared to like go there

3411.76 --> 3417.5200000000004
maybe right especially since

3415.28 --> 3419.28
yeah when trolls come in i become like

3417.52 --> 3422.48
really

3419.28 --> 3423.92
i certainly get could yeah do get very

3422.48 --> 3427.2
tight and a little dark

3423.92 --> 3428.7200000000003
and yeah so i don't know

3427.2 --> 3432.48
i don't know whether why there aren't

3428.72 --> 3435.1189999999997
more i don't know why there's not like

3432.48 --> 3436.64
a thousand views every day at least i

3435.119 --> 3440.0
don't know

3436.64 --> 3442.0789999999997
i don't know if there might be that much

3440.0 --> 3447.839
and it's all suppressed i don't know

3442.079 --> 3447.8390000000004
i just don't know

3447.92 --> 3452.48
could i can have oh i could point at all

3451.28 --> 3455.119
kinds of

3452.48 --> 3457.28
things that are potential source of

3455.119 --> 3461.6800000000003
criticism why people don't really

3457.28 --> 3464.4
like my shows maybe it's too raw

3461.68 --> 3464.8799999999997
maybe they don't like that i also bring

3464.4 --> 3469.2000000000003
up

3464.88 --> 3469.2000000000003
like subjects like my dental works

3469.44 --> 3476.319
or that i don't have

3472.48 --> 3478.16
consistent themed based systems

3476.319 --> 3479.839
that are literally whatever comes up

3478.16 --> 3482.0789999999997
i'll start talking about it

3479.839 --> 3483.04
like totally out of nowhere maybe they

3482.079 --> 3486.559
don't like that

3483.04 --> 3489.839
i i yeah

3486.559 --> 3489.8390000000004
could be all kinds of things

3498.4 --> 3503.839
are witnessing raw

3505.68 --> 3509.5989999999997
all right maybe a lot of people just

3507.92 --> 3513.2000000000003
have a lot of

3509.599 --> 3514.1600000000003
things they're hiding and they're scared

3513.2 --> 3517.359
that if they

3514.16 --> 3519.839
drop in i'll suddenly just pick it right

3517.359 --> 3521.68
out of them

3519.839 --> 3523.68
something that they don't really want

3521.68 --> 3528.24
people to know about themselves

3523.68 --> 3531.839
this is i don't know what it is man

3528.24 --> 3531.839
ah yeah thanks nathan

3543.119 --> 3559.839
garnish all right

3570.839 --> 3575.52
yes okay nathan oakley

3577.76 --> 3581.599
thanks for the advertisement

3581.76 --> 3586.96
i don't know if jesus would do that

3584.839 --> 3590.5589999999997
though

3586.96 --> 3593.599
but i think what jesus would probably do

3590.559 --> 3593.599
is talk with me

3595.599 --> 3601.839
i hope i hope he would

3605.2 --> 3615.839
maybe he would they'd maybe he would

3608.4 --> 3615.839
share the show if

3620.079 --> 3623.119
crypto you really think he's you would

3622.24 --> 3629.4399999999996
get into crypt

3623.119 --> 3632.6400000000003
uh well you know who knows man

3629.44 --> 3635.359
who am i to say if jesus would or

3632.64 --> 3637.839
wouldn't do that

3635.359 --> 3638.48
i'm pretty sure that he wouldn't like

3637.839 --> 3643.7599999999998
rely

3638.48 --> 3645.599
all his futures on crypto like that

3643.76 --> 3646.88
but you might just use it a little on

3645.599 --> 3650.1600000000003
the side that's kind of

3646.88 --> 3650.1600000000003
like how i feel about it

3653.2 --> 3657.839
okay okay

3658.799 --> 3664.96
would it not be awesome to talk to jesus

3661.839 --> 3667.92
well i've heard this rumor

3664.96 --> 3672.16
through a lot of christians that you can

3667.92 --> 3672.16
just do that right

3680.96 --> 3685.359
that's also the reason why it's not

3682.799 --> 3688.16
really hard for me to imagine

3685.359 --> 3691.119
interacting with this is because i have

3688.16 --> 3691.1189999999997
kind of done that

3697.68 --> 3702.96
it just becomes a little weird when you

3700.48 --> 3706.72
take that simulation and then suddenly

3702.96 --> 3706.7200000000003
you start to reify it into

3707.28 --> 3713.119
like an actual source of information

3710.88 --> 3715.6800000000003
and an entity that's when things get a

3713.119 --> 3715.6800000000003
little weird

3718.559 --> 3723.599
have i ever named met a guy named jesus

3720.64 --> 3726.48
yeah sure dude

3723.599 --> 3741.839
i went to spain there's jesus is all

3726.48 --> 3741.839
over the place there

3752.839 --> 3755.839
so

3766.839 --> 3769.359
what uh

3775.599 --> 3783.839
you turn over the tape over tables of

3778.96 --> 3783.839
mining pcs

3784.16 --> 3788.16
you mean he'd short circuit them

3793.119 --> 3798.48
who knows man maybe jesus would be like

3795.44 --> 3798.48
a lead hacker

3801.039 --> 3807.92
you know if yeah it's crazy it's this is

3804.48 --> 3807.92
silly to think about this [ __ ]

3808.72 --> 3814.5589999999997
it's just that i don't know like

3812.64 --> 3816.0
what that wouldn't that be weird if he

3814.559 --> 3819.8390000000004
came back

3816.0 --> 3821.359
in this time and attained skills of this

3819.839 --> 3823.2799999999997
age

3821.359 --> 3824.64
i don't know man it it's kind of

3823.28 --> 3839.8390000000004
weirding me out

3824.64 --> 3839.839
even thinking about that

3844.0 --> 3848.64
right so what would be flipping the

3846.16 --> 3852.24
tables of money changers

3848.64 --> 3855.5989999999997
right what if you would translate

3852.24 --> 3857.839
the setup from way back then

3855.599 --> 3861.3590000000004
like what effectively was happening is

3857.839 --> 3861.359
temple it's a good place

3861.68 --> 3867.2
and then grapplers want to make money

3865.359 --> 3869.2799999999997
off that

3867.2 --> 3870.319
so how would that effectively translate

3869.28 --> 3874.6400000000003
to a modern day

3870.319 --> 3874.64
situation and exactly that setup

3876.319 --> 3884.0
would that be the banks

3880.0 --> 3884.0
and then what would the effect be

3884.799 --> 3888.16
it's like not robbing banks or anything

3886.799 --> 3892.72
but maybe just

3888.16 --> 3897.2
like hacking them trolling them

3892.72 --> 3897.2
or something i don't know

3898.319 --> 3901.0389999999998
maybe it's like

3902.0 --> 3905.44
like leaking documents

3905.52 --> 3910.0
just be really good at their job get in

3907.68 --> 3912.319
there and then at some point like make

3910.0 --> 3914.24
the whole expose the whole thing

3912.319 --> 3916.5589999999997
would that be what something that jesus

3914.24 --> 3916.5589999999997
would do

3920.64 --> 3926.16
i dunno

3923.839 --> 3926.16
okay

3927.28 --> 3937.8390000000004
mining pieces

3942.48 --> 3946.88
yeah i agree good servant but it's

3944.72 --> 3951.839
nathan oakley you know

3946.88 --> 3951.839
he'll be like that

3975.2 --> 3979.839
wait gaining wisdom what are you talking

3977.359 --> 3979.839
about

3983.44 --> 3993.839
you got presented with the infamous 1k

3987.039 --> 3993.8390000000004
rant first thought there was literally

3994.64 --> 4007.839
going to throttle fe dude

4009.76 --> 4017.2000000000003
my channel title is fv

4013.2 --> 4020.64
what is it my channel title

4017.2 --> 4021.68
is arwyn my show title is flat earth

4020.64 --> 4035.839
early bird and

4021.68 --> 4035.839
flat earth talks before that

4045.68 --> 4048.8799999999997
but it's yeah still trying to figure out

4047.599 --> 4052.799
what you meant with

4048.88 --> 4056.0
i think you may have wanted a certain

4052.799 --> 4059.839
range of charter type like

4056.0 --> 4063.839
what what do you

4059.839 --> 4063.839
mean with that

4066.88 --> 4077.839
a range of charter type of what

4090.48 --> 4097.52
i'm catching you with subscribers really

4093.68 --> 4097.5199999999995
okay personality types

4102.64 --> 4105.839
what are you doing

4108.56 --> 4112.159000000001
catching catching up to you with who

4111.44 --> 4114.719
cares

4112.159 --> 4119.04
you didn't have to time him out for that

4114.719 --> 4121.44
come on

4119.04 --> 4123.2789999999995
dude i don't care like everybody in the

4121.44 --> 4124.48
freaking world can outgrow me like

4123.279 --> 4127.52
literally

4124.48 --> 4129.599999999999
complete apes

4127.52 --> 4132.4800000000005
that barely know how to interface with

4129.6 --> 4133.52
the computer and communicate that have

4132.48 --> 4138.0
no

4133.52 --> 4138.0
substantial ideas of their own

4138.08 --> 4141.839
barely even know how to learn can just

4140.48 --> 4144.5599999999995
get on their

4141.839 --> 4147.679
talk like a [ __ ] and they'll get a

4144.56 --> 4152.2390000000005
thousand subscribers in a couple of days

4147.679 --> 4154.4800000000005
you know it it doesn't mean anything

4152.239 --> 4155.678999999999
not really or well it does mean

4154.48 --> 4160.159
something

4155.679 --> 4163.52
it's just that

4160.159 --> 4166.3189999999995
i'm using what i feel

4163.52 --> 4168.159000000001
is like a manipulation like pretty

4166.319 --> 4168.96
overpowering manipulation from the

4168.159 --> 4172.0
outside

4168.96 --> 4173.52
that i don't really have grip off as an

4172.0 --> 4177.92
opportunity

4173.52 --> 4180.56
to study it while it is happening

4177.92 --> 4181.52
and to make people aware that it there

4180.56 --> 4184.56
is some chance

4181.52 --> 4187.52
that it is happening the manipulation of

4184.56 --> 4192.080000000001
my show and my audience

4187.52 --> 4192.080000000001
who gets to find out about me

4192.48 --> 4197.759999999999
in what context right who knows maybe by

4195.679 --> 4199.1990000000005
now everybody in the world has seen

4197.76 --> 4201.04
something about me

4199.199 --> 4202.239
but it would be at the worst moment

4201.04 --> 4204.08
conceivable it's like

4202.239 --> 4205.678999999999
right when they feel like i need to tear

4204.08 --> 4207.28
something apart and that's like youtube

4205.679 --> 4210.2390000000005
like oh oh

4207.28 --> 4210.239
look at this guy

4210.64 --> 4218.159000000001
look at how stupid he is right

4214.08 --> 4218.159
something that could happen

4220.32 --> 4223.92
and i wouldn't even know about it

4224.0 --> 4227.76
and i know there's certain types of

4225.92 --> 4230.159
trolls hearing this that are now

4227.76 --> 4232.159000000001
absolutely squirting and that's fine you

4230.159 --> 4236.719
know

4232.159 --> 4236.719
that's what they do can't really stop it

4238.08 --> 4246.8
i'm just like like no

4242.32 --> 4250.32
like no i really don't care

4246.8 --> 4252.2390000000005
i used to thought it would make a

4250.32 --> 4256.4
difference to care

4252.239 --> 4258.959999999999
and then i figure out i was wrong

4256.4 --> 4260.5599999999995
it doesn't matter only thing that

4258.96 --> 4263.84
matters is that i continue

4260.56 --> 4265.52
doing what i do that i actually interact

4263.84 --> 4268.4800000000005
with real people

4265.52 --> 4268.4800000000005
that i built on

4268.719 --> 4275.44
that i build up a intellectual legacy

4272.239 --> 4279.36
with in them

4275.44 --> 4280.32
and in me and here on the platform even

4279.36 --> 4284.0
though

4280.32 --> 4284.0
it's supposedly insignificant

4285.12 --> 4289.04
that we have done it that we are doing

4288.32 --> 4292.48
it

4289.04 --> 4301.84
pretty much no matter what no matter how

4292.48 --> 4301.839999999999
things may appear

4303.36 --> 4306.57
[Music]

4311.05 --> 4314.159000000001
[Music]

4326.96 --> 4333.76
the vatican watches jesus very closely

4331.76 --> 4337.12
wait wait are you saying that he is here

4333.76 --> 4337.12
already walking on the earth

4340.84 --> 4343.84
what

4349.84 --> 4359.6
hey tony whitcomb uh

4357.28 --> 4361.04
is he banging said no he was timed out

4359.6 --> 4363.280000000001
by uh

4361.04 --> 4365.84
by agm for some reason which i don't

4363.28 --> 4365.84
appreciate

4366.56 --> 4372.719
talking piss about you no not really

4370.56 --> 4374.400000000001
that's called joking around dude

4372.719 --> 4384.64
stallion 8012's probably

4374.4 --> 4387.12
known me just as long as you have a gem

4384.64 --> 4388.96
and yeah it's okay to gist you know with

4387.12 --> 4392.8
that

4388.96 --> 4395.679
like look if some random troll like

4392.8 --> 4397.360000000001
named shitty sock or whatever literally

4395.679 --> 4399.36
comes in and says

4397.36 --> 4401.36
more subscribers than are we know who

4399.36 --> 4401.679
look at you you're such a loser yeah

4401.36 --> 4403.5199999999995
yeah

4401.679 --> 4405.76
then you time them out of course or

4403.52 --> 4407.52
bannon right but this is a guy that's

4405.76 --> 4408.159000000001
been in my chat a long time and it's

4407.52 --> 4411.040000000001
just

4408.159 --> 4412.48
kind of just thing like haha i'm

4411.04 --> 4414.96
catching up to you

4412.48 --> 4417.36
i might overtake you and yeah that is

4414.96 --> 4417.36
funny

4417.52 --> 4423.4400000000005
it is because it's crazy in a way

4421.44 --> 4424.5599999999995
and that's okay that that's not his

4423.44 --> 4428.0
fault

4424.56 --> 4431.84
and he gets that that it is crazy

4428.0 --> 4434.32
in a way i mean stallion 80 12 does not

4431.84 --> 4438.4800000000005
despise me

4434.32 --> 4440.239
he has shown that he respects me

4438.48 --> 4442.4
doesn't mean that he doesn't joke around

4440.239 --> 4443.919999999999
sometimes

4442.4 --> 4447.199
and doesn't mean that he's perfect

4443.92 --> 4450.4
because he's still a baller

4447.199 --> 4451.44
but yeah he's one of the more reserved

4450.4 --> 4455.839999999999
ones

4451.44 --> 4455.839999999999
so yeah

4458.4 --> 4463.92
it wasn't there was no need to time that

4461.12 --> 4463.92
but that's okay

4465.84 --> 4469.6
didn't see the whole story yeah well

4467.28 --> 4471.199
that's because yeah he got timed out

4469.6 --> 4472.64
that's also what happens when you get

4471.199 --> 4475.839999999999
timed out

4472.64 --> 4478.4800000000005
is that google then deletes the

4475.84 --> 4483.84
sentences

4478.48 --> 4483.839999999999
it's not very handy like that

4494.8 --> 4501.12
do you think giants are chained in

4498.0 --> 4505.36
underground lab what

4501.12 --> 4505.36
okay that came out of nowhere

4506.56 --> 4512.2390000000005
what drives you to think that

4522.84 --> 4525.84
what

4532.08 --> 4538.08
i mean i'd say that if yeah

4535.6 --> 4539.52
unless they were like mutants and really

4538.08 --> 4542.159
weak

4539.52 --> 4542.8
why would you have like a really strong

4542.159 --> 4546.32
literally

4542.8 --> 4548.320000000001
human capable giants

4546.32 --> 4550.0
chained up in an underground lab like

4548.32 --> 4550.88
how long is that gonna take before they

4550.0 --> 4554.56
literally just

4550.88 --> 4559.1990000000005
break out cause a

4554.56 --> 4559.1990000000005
major havoc it's i what

4562.64 --> 4567.92
it's more colored yeah i haven't seen

4564.32 --> 4567.92
more color for a while where is he

4568.8 --> 4571.84
hope he's doing okay

4575.6 --> 4581.84
could be he's just on vacation though

4586.4 --> 4592.839999999999
right see i totally called it see

4590.08 --> 4595.84
stalin 8012 and me have kind of this

4592.84 --> 4595.84
understanding

4596.0 --> 4599.44
and agm just kind of took you for a

4597.92 --> 4602.719
troll and hey you

4599.44 --> 4604.239
sometimes do act

4602.719 --> 4606.159
a little bit like a troll but it's

4604.239 --> 4606.879999999999
almost like no you're acting like a

4606.159 --> 4610.4
troll

4606.88 --> 4614.2390000000005
like you're at like you're enacting them

4610.4 --> 4616.32
kind of to make fun of the situation but

4614.239 --> 4618.4
in the core you are definitely not a

4616.32 --> 4621.759999999999
troll i think

4618.4 --> 4624.159
from what i've seen so far

4621.76 --> 4624.159000000001
anyway

4624.88 --> 4629.36
oh yeah seeking star wars yeah where is

4634.84 --> 4637.84
she

4644.4 --> 4647.599999999999
this will come soon enough the beast

4646.159 --> 4650.639999999999
runs the world

4647.6 --> 4653.6
uh well

4650.64 --> 4656.320000000001
that's been going on for a while though

4653.6 --> 4656.320000000001
good servant

4662.84 --> 4665.84
so

4674.159 --> 4678.0
look i'm not gonna wait for jesus's

4676.239 --> 4680.32
return right i'm just gonna do my

4678.0 --> 4680.32
best

4686.88 --> 4694.88
yeah george sanford don't do that

4692.4 --> 4694.879999999999
the hell

4699.679 --> 4707.84
i don't even think that's funny

4710.08 --> 4721.84
hold on

4726.08 --> 4733.28
right so with supposedly with jesus's

4729.44 --> 4733.28
return as it is written down

4733.36 --> 4742.239
nobody knows when what once it happens

4737.52 --> 4742.2390000000005
there is no mistaken there like

4742.32 --> 4746.4
and and that's if that's real then that

4745.679 --> 4750.64
is taking

4746.4 --> 4752.48
into account how easy people can be

4750.64 --> 4756.0
fooled

4752.48 --> 4756.4
and how willing a whole group of people

4756.0 --> 4759.28
are

4756.4 --> 4760.839999999999
to basically fool the people about

4759.28 --> 4765.5199999999995
anything they can

4760.84 --> 4767.1990000000005
right so for me it is like okay

4765.52 --> 4769.52
there's probably going to be a whole lot

4767.199 --> 4772.48
of claims of jesus's

4769.52 --> 4775.1990000000005
that are returning in some minor or

4772.48 --> 4775.199
major way

4775.44 --> 4782.4
and people might wonder

4779.12 --> 4786.8
but if the jesus

4782.4 --> 4792.08
god himself would return

4786.8 --> 4795.04
then there would be no doubt possible

4792.08 --> 4795.04
like so

4795.28 --> 4798.719
if i'm not mistaken

4799.6 --> 4804.320000000001
there would be no doubt there would only

4801.44 --> 4819.839999999999
be acceptance or rejection

4804.32 --> 4819.84
right did i remember that correctly

4844.84 --> 4847.84
hmm

4851.199 --> 4854.719
okay stallion 8012

4854.88 --> 4861.84
it's enough with the apologies it's all

4858.84 --> 4861.84
right

4862.88 --> 4875.84
guys get it

4881.84 --> 4889.84
a lighter than air garbage can what

4891.92 --> 4903.84
i would be pretty cool to just have a

4893.92 --> 4903.84
decent zeppelin

4928.84 --> 4931.84
hmm

4934.4 --> 4938.879999999999
air ships bringing back bringing them

4936.639 --> 4938.88
back

4939.199 --> 4945.839999999999
who knows man

4950.239 --> 4956.159
but the thing is though that airships do

4952.96 --> 4956.159
take up a lot of space

4956.84 --> 4959.84
and

4961.04 --> 4967.28
yeah i don't know if it would work

4965.04 --> 4968.08
all that great altogether if like

4967.28 --> 4970.96
airships

4968.08 --> 4972.08
and helicopters and and airplanes

4970.96 --> 4975.12
personal airplanes

4972.08 --> 4975.679
were all allowed in the same space it

4975.12 --> 4980.48
might be

4975.679 --> 4982.639
a little bit of a hassle i'm not sure

4980.48 --> 4987.839999999999
too volatile not it doesn't have to be

4982.639 --> 4987.84
too volatile agm

4989.76 --> 4995.84
if that's what you're talking about our

4992.0 --> 5001.84
ships can just run on helium really

4995.84 --> 5001.84
oh nasa has all the helium

5005.28 --> 5009.92
maybe nasa is going to run an airship

5007.52 --> 5012.96
industry

5009.92 --> 5016.2390000000005
ever considered that

5012.96 --> 5017.679
zeppelin incorporated they could

5016.239 --> 5020.799999999999
literally just provide

5017.679 --> 5024.0
like a hundred thousand zeppelins for

5020.8 --> 5024.0
everyone in the world

5026.84 --> 5029.84
maybe

5032.4 --> 5043.839999999999
they certainly have the helium

5050.03 --> 5053.5
[Music]

5054.84 --> 5059.21
um

5056.04 --> 5059.21
[Music]

5060.0 --> 5063.36
it's the gay guy again

5068.84 --> 5074.639
what okay

5071.44 --> 5076.32
this one is hilarious it's the troll guy

5074.639 --> 5077.76
i think it i don't know who it is it

5076.32 --> 5080.719
doesn't really matter but

5077.76 --> 5082.2390000000005
just like troll comments i'm gonna show

5080.719 --> 5085.199
you

5082.239 --> 5087.44
this what he said now you can't read

5085.199 --> 5087.44
that

5088.4 --> 5093.36
god is dead that's a great start

5091.52 --> 5095.679
just take a look at yourself in your

5093.36 --> 5097.04
current state oh i'm in such a terrible

5095.679 --> 5100.08
state man

5097.04 --> 5102.32
such a terrible state you know you're

5100.08 --> 5105.44
completely delusional all right

5102.32 --> 5108.639
and need help god hates you

5105.44 --> 5112.0
and i thought you said god was dead

5108.639 --> 5114.32
now he hates me what

5112.0 --> 5114.32
ah

5118.32 --> 5127.84
i'm gonna send him a text back

5129.679 --> 5132.4800000000005
your

5135.52 --> 5138.2390000000005
vain

5139.199 --> 5141.839999999999
there you go

5156.0 --> 5161.84
would i go up in an airship

5159.44 --> 5161.839999999999
maybe

5166.96 --> 5171.199
if i could get a at least a uh

5171.6 --> 5180.84
a backup parachute as well

5176.719 --> 5183.84
in case of an emergency like

5180.84 --> 5183.84
guaranteed

5184.56 --> 5197.84
sure why not

5222.84 --> 5225.84
what

5234.0 --> 5239.84
what the hell iron effie

5241.12 --> 5243.5199999999995
is that

5244.239 --> 5246.48
what

5249.12 --> 5253.84
is that a real guy or is that a sock

5271.44 --> 5281.839999999999
stallion has been exposed what are you

5273.679 --> 5281.84
talking about

5300.0 --> 5306.4
no that's iron fe that's weird

5303.12 --> 5309.04
uh i'm just gonna put you in

5306.4 --> 5311.28
timeout dude i don't know why you said

5309.04 --> 5311.28
that

5313.28 --> 5323.84
and stallion didn't say that that was

5315.84 --> 5323.84
ironfe or capital letters that said that

5334.84 --> 5337.84
so

5358.239 --> 5365.839999999999
i think we got some trolls in the house

5387.84 --> 5393.84
yeah get out

5400.96 --> 5410.159
it was on stallion's channel

5404.84 --> 5410.159000000001
okay well yeah dude he is still a baller

5410.48 --> 5414.959999999999
so if he has something on his channel or

5413.76 --> 5416.719
he let that slip

5414.96 --> 5418.8
yeah that's his progress this channel

5416.719 --> 5421.36
i'm not promoting his channel i don't

5418.8 --> 5424.400000000001
even know what's on it

5421.36 --> 5427.679
even though he's gaining subscribers

5424.4 --> 5432.0
all i'm really care about is

5427.679 --> 5434.0
how he refers to me also outside and

5432.0 --> 5436.08
just how he behaves in this chat now if

5434.0 --> 5438.0
he wants to still be a baller and be a

5436.08 --> 5440.32
baller with other ballers that's his

5438.0 --> 5443.12
prerogative

5440.32 --> 5445.28
and yeah ballers talk [ __ ] about flat

5443.12 --> 5448.5599999999995
earthers

5445.28 --> 5451.759999999999
that's what they do

5448.56 --> 5453.52
i don't even care

5451.76 --> 5463.84
as long as he's not gonna go there in

5453.52 --> 5463.84
this chat

5473.199 --> 5481.759999999999
oh okay i get it now iron fv

5478.719 --> 5486.4
he was basically quoting

5481.76 --> 5490.0
except he didn't use any quotations

5486.4 --> 5492.08
so he was quoting it from stallion's

5490.0 --> 5494.96
channel right well i have no idea that

5492.08 --> 5494.96
he was doing that

5497.04 --> 5500.88
and stalin had it on his channel well

5499.199 --> 5503.5199999999995
fine

5500.88 --> 5506.159000000001
he had it on his channel what's the

5503.52 --> 5506.159000000001
problem here

5507.6 --> 5512.400000000001
iron if he was a hero he's not banned

5510.159 --> 5519.839999999999
he's just timed out

5512.4 --> 5519.839999999999
he'll be back

5544.88 --> 5548.639
right i agree rasta hat

5549.12 --> 5552.4
let's just relax

5552.639 --> 5561.84
yeah we'll be back in two minutes take

5556.239 --> 5561.839999999999
it easy

5572.84 --> 5575.84
so

5586.84 --> 5589.84
so

5642.84 --> 5645.84
so

5647.6 --> 5650.400000000001
and i'm back

5654.159 --> 5663.28
from his youtube page

5659.36 --> 5666.48
huh okay iron fe

5663.28 --> 5670.32
or can he still even alter that

5666.48 --> 5673.44
because there at some point it's like

5670.32 --> 5674.4
you can't change anything anymore that's

5673.44 --> 5677.678999999999
on there

5674.4 --> 5680.159
like i had like one final chance to

5677.679 --> 5684.2390000000005
basically alter the input

5680.159 --> 5687.599999999999
that's on my youtube about page

5684.239 --> 5691.678999999999
of my channel but now

5687.6 --> 5691.679
you can't edit that anymore

5691.76 --> 5698.96
so yeah like even if stallion

5695.44 --> 5700.32
8012 like would like to remove that

5698.96 --> 5703.679
because it was kind of

5700.32 --> 5705.36
a ballerish thing to say at the time and

5703.679 --> 5707.92
he's not like that anymore he can't

5705.36 --> 5714.0
change that unless he literally

5707.92 --> 5717.28
starts a new channel

5714.0 --> 5720.48
right unless you can edit it again

5717.28 --> 5720.48
i don't think so though

5720.56 --> 5729.84
i i wouldn't know how to do that

5736.32 --> 5740.159
you can always change the about page

5738.88 --> 5743.84
okay

5740.159 --> 5743.839999999999
can you tell me how to do that

5745.28 --> 5757.84
that would be interesting

5767.36 --> 5772.08
looking through youtube studio right now

5769.92 --> 5772.08
but

5772.96 --> 5785.84
there's no section for the about page

5834.88 --> 5841.84
right there's only like a basic

5839.6 --> 5841.84
info

5843.119 --> 5847.04
that you can edit

5847.28 --> 5855.84
with like keywords that's it

5862.0 --> 5869.84
so yeah i don't know how to get there

5873.92 --> 5877.76
okay it was still in 80 12 all right i

5876.48 --> 5881.28
thought so

5877.76 --> 5884.96
so if you ever find out exactly

5881.28 --> 5888.159
how to edit it please let me know

5884.96 --> 5888.719
like seriously i i just dug through the

5888.159 --> 5891.679
whole

5888.719 --> 5893.679
youtube studio thing basically the

5891.679 --> 5895.679
options that i have

5893.679 --> 5898.159
and i couldn't find anywhere how you can

5895.679 --> 5900.4800000000005
edit it so

5898.159 --> 5903.759999999999
if you managed to do that please let me

5900.48 --> 5903.759999999999
know how you did that

5909.28 --> 5914.08
dude i'm gonna give you a wrench at this

5922.84 --> 5925.84
point

5932.239 --> 5939.839999999999
channel customization basic info okay

5962.48 --> 5967.839999999999
wait in the customization

5972.4 --> 5979.5199999999995
oh [ __ ] you're right

5976.32 --> 5984.4
i found yes holy [ __ ]

5979.52 --> 5984.400000000001
you're totally right it's there

5984.88 --> 5990.2390000000005
huh okay that's interesting

5992.84 --> 5995.84
right

5997.119 --> 6000.0
yeah that works

6002.8 --> 6009.360000000001
right so you go to youtube studio in

6007.6 --> 6010.159000000001
there you have a special menu and then

6009.36 --> 6012.08
on the side

6010.159 --> 6014.879999999999
you have like the one with the three

6012.08 --> 6017.84
stars customization and in there

6014.88 --> 6021.04
three sub menu options basic info and

6017.84 --> 6021.04
it's right there yeah you're right

6021.76 --> 6024.2390000000005
all right

6025.119 --> 6027.44
cool

6032.4 --> 6036.879999999999
it's funny because there's it's been a

6034.32 --> 6040.32
long time

6036.88 --> 6040.32
since i updated this

6042.32 --> 6046.4
still has some old terminologies

6049.199 --> 6055.04
i might remove some stuff there and

6052.32 --> 6055.04
replace it

6062.84 --> 6065.84
cool

6067.119 --> 6071.92
hey james mason yeah thanks for the uh

6073.92 --> 6079.84
don't give me that was it

6087.28 --> 6091.199
right yeah george sanford thank you for

6089.04 --> 6091.199
that

6091.44 --> 6093.839999999999
uh

6097.04 --> 6107.84
why are you under the triumphal arc

6100.8 --> 6107.84
is that what it is

6120.239 --> 6124.32
all right well why it was basically

6122.56 --> 6126.88
chosen

6124.32 --> 6127.679
as a prop and it's a gate i just thought

6126.88 --> 6130.56
like yeah that's

6127.679 --> 6130.56
pretty cool to be

6131.199 --> 6135.839999999999
in a gate like that

6138.159 --> 6143.599999999999
or an arch triumphal arch

6141.76 --> 6149.280000000001
i don't know if it's necessarily that

6143.6 --> 6153.52
it's a little small for that

6149.28 --> 6153.5199999999995
you can see it as a doorway perhaps

6155.92 --> 6161.04
and for those who wonder yeah this gate

6158.239 --> 6166.239
i'm not keeping it

6161.04 --> 6166.239
right i'm actually here to invite

6174.84 --> 6177.84
through

6194.88 --> 6198.96
hmm yeah the well said gaining wisdom

6199.04 --> 6201.92
that's interesting

6202.48 --> 6208.4
this place looping yeah

6205.679 --> 6208.96
potential is incredible and it could

6208.4 --> 6213.28
like

6208.96 --> 6213.28
see in so many ways and settings

6215.52 --> 6219.119000000001
and i've laid out a whole bunch of

6217.44 --> 6222.0
options

6219.119 --> 6222.719
possibilities that i can conceive of so

6222.0 --> 6225.6
who knows

6222.719 --> 6228.0
where god would bring it in the ultimate

6225.6 --> 6228.0

sometimes it was a little bit of a

6652.719 --> 6660.0
silent pause here and there

6655.679 --> 6661.36
a lot of weird little details about

6660.0 --> 6664.08
things

6661.36 --> 6664.08
in the chat

6664.4 --> 6668.719
so that maybe everything was all super

6666.96 --> 6671.119
interesting

6668.719 --> 6672.4
but i had a couple of in yeah

6671.119 --> 6675.04
interesting thoughts

6672.4 --> 6676.4
about religion and like oh people say oh

6675.04 --> 6678.719
the religion

6676.4 --> 6680.719
kills people and then i basically

6678.719 --> 6683.52
postulated like okay so

6680.719 --> 6685.76
which part about following the religion

6683.52 --> 6688.320000000001
exactly killed

6685.76 --> 6689.84
or is it actually not following it that

6688.32 --> 6692.08
caused that

6689.84 --> 6693.360000000001
right something worth thinking about i

6692.08 --> 6697.04
think that pretty much

6693.36 --> 6697.04
made the show pretty good

6697.119 --> 6700.88

6699.679 --> 6704.32
