anyway yeah starting late sorry about

112.02 --> 116.579
that

113.0 --> 119.28
just I overslept

116.579 --> 121.55999999999999
actually now I'll get to that anyway the

119.28 --> 124.38
weather is

121.56 --> 127.2
kind of Cloudy it's a couple of blue

124.38 --> 129.97899999999998
spots there but it's yeah there's no sun

127.2 --> 129.979
coming through that

130.319 --> 134.39999999999998
so it's a bit windy

132.72 --> 137.22
cloudy

134.4 --> 140.42000000000002
there hasn't been actual rain though

137.22 --> 140.42
surprisingly really

141.599 --> 146.879
and yeah it is it is just much milder I

145.379 --> 150.67999999999998
don't know what it is probably like six

146.879 --> 150.67999999999998
or eight degrees something like that

151.44 --> 157.379
because it's not a really even that cold

154.28 --> 159.2
except like if you're in the wind though

157.379 --> 162.739
that is kind of cool

159.2 --> 162.73899999999998
right anyway

163.92 --> 169.819
it is the last day of January

167.519 --> 174.48000000000002
Tuesday the

169.819 --> 174.48
31st of January 2023

175.5 --> 180.54
ah

177.63 --> 185.239
[Music]

180.54 --> 185.239
yeah temperature is 8 degrees Celsius

187.44 --> 191.06
I thought so something like that

196.14 --> 202.61999999999998
and yeah I'm really late oh I'll really

199.56 --> 207.2
uh like 35 minutes late

202.62 --> 207.20000000000002
because I woke up from 15 minutes to one

209.879 --> 214.14
because I I don't know I was just really

212.34 --> 216.18
comfortable in my bed and I just didn't

214.14 --> 218.76
remember actually that my alarm clock

216.18 --> 220.5
even went off

218.76 --> 222.48
apparently it did and then I turned it

220.5 --> 224.7
off so quickly that it just immediately

222.48 --> 227.23899999999998
fell back to sleep and forgot that that

224.7 --> 227.23899999999998
even happened

227.78 --> 234.019
but yeah I had a really good sleep very

231.0 --> 234.019
intense dreams

234.06 --> 236.78
but

237.42 --> 243.78
like it wasn't even in the dreams it it

240.06 --> 246.019
was I was studying I was studying the

243.78 --> 246.019
dream

246.379 --> 251.459
like what was happening I was studying

249.06 --> 253.92000000000002
my sensories

251.459 --> 256.5
so I was like almost getting all meta on

253.92 --> 257.82
my own dream with analysis while I was

256.5 --> 260.16
dreaming

257.82 --> 263.09999999999997
and

260.16 --> 264.86
was just interested in like hey there's

263.1 --> 268.259
this

264.86 --> 269.82
nerve spot or something whatever that is

268.259 --> 272.88
a shocker where that just starts

269.82 --> 276.12
radiating energy and over here there's

272.88 --> 278.46
that and then in like just almost trying

276.12 --> 280.56
to figure it out like a musical

278.46 --> 282.18
instrument that's like why that one why

280.56 --> 284.52
there why there

282.18 --> 287.22
and but yeah they had just a lot of

284.52 --> 290.419
energy coming out of me apparently

287.22 --> 290.41900000000004
while I was dreaming

292.38 --> 299.52
having some sort of flashback

296.34 --> 304.03999999999996
micro dreams like flashbacks within the

299.52 --> 304.03999999999996
dream of like when I was younger

305.1 --> 309.36
when I had a really high energy State

307.139 --> 311.46000000000004
and it's so weird I've been thinking

309.36 --> 313.56
more back about it and it's really like

311.46 --> 316.919
there's just these different states of

313.56 --> 320.88
mind that I have but in my memory

316.919 --> 324.96
they're almost like separate sides of me

320.88 --> 326.82
and each side has its own correlating

324.96 --> 329.46
memory

326.82 --> 332.15999999999997
that memories that typically associate

329.46 --> 335.09999999999997
and pop up in that state

332.16 --> 337.02000000000004
and that is apparently a big way of how

335.1 --> 339.32000000000005
I function but it's been a real puzzle

337.02 --> 339.32
to me

340.979 --> 344.21999999999997
right even though I've already been

342.6 --> 346.44
trying to describe it like for example

344.22 --> 348.53900000000004
with anger like because it also works

346.44 --> 351.12
with anger like rage win

348.539 --> 352.919
has his own

351.12 --> 357.259
memories

352.919 --> 357.25899999999996
it's re it's kind of weird like that

358.8 --> 365.88
I mean there's shared memories with all

362.759 --> 369.36
the states but every state has their own

365.88 --> 372.0
kind of branch of memories

369.36 --> 373.199
from different moments in my life

372.0 --> 375.539
and

373.199 --> 378.0
like the intuitions that come with that

375.539 --> 380.09999999999997
state that would then in those moments

378.0 --> 382.139
pop up and yield information and then

380.1 --> 384.36
all that information suddenly comes back

382.139 --> 387.259
because I'm in that state that's

384.36 --> 387.259
basically what happens

387.3 --> 391.46000000000004
and I was kind of studying that

391.8 --> 397.08
in my dream

394.74 --> 399.12
it's just fascinating anyway

397.08 --> 402.85999999999996
so yeah I had some trouble getting up

399.12 --> 402.86
and that's why I'm late

403.02 --> 406.28
where's everybody

414.78 --> 418.63899999999995
hmm

416.1 --> 418.639
right

418.68 --> 422.40000000000003
I guess I'm I'm probably not the only

420.84 --> 425.4
one then

422.4 --> 427.02
and I'm noticing that also often these

425.4 --> 430.25899999999996
days I mean I do a show every day and

427.02 --> 433.139
every time I get like really late

430.259 --> 437.12
because I overslept then for some reason

433.139 --> 437.12
a lot of people just overslept

438.0 --> 443.419
and like it's it's kind of weird but I

441.24 --> 443.419
mean

445.139 --> 450.24
maybe there's people like in the west of

448.319 --> 451.8
the United States that actually just

450.24 --> 454.38
like

451.8 --> 457.199
wake up with their alarm clock just to

454.38 --> 459.36
watch my show or something

457.199 --> 461.22
I mean maybe it's kind of interesting

459.36 --> 464.88
watching my show when you're in a half

461.22 --> 466.8
dream state because I typically talk a

464.88 --> 469.139
lot about dreams and then it might be

466.8 --> 470.52000000000004
easier for you to even imagine like what

469.139 --> 472.56
I'm saying then

470.52 --> 473.94
maybe I'm better understand more

472.56 --> 475.56
understandable when you're in a dream

473.94 --> 478.319
state and that would explain why a lot

475.56 --> 480.78000000000003
of people kind of zone out eventually

478.319 --> 483.18
like even if they were in the chat when

480.78 --> 486.31899999999996
I'm talking because they're just zoning

483.18 --> 486.319
in the dream and hate it

486.419 --> 491.21999999999997
it's early morning and you just woke up

488.58 --> 493.44
you're probably already gonna be sort of

491.22 --> 496.03900000000004
halfway in that dream state

493.44 --> 496.039
anyway

496.62 --> 503.52
nobody here just yet

499.199 --> 506.32
ah Terry 306 good to see you

503.52 --> 509.46
I was there in the last 20 minutes what

506.32 --> 511.02
[Music]

509.46 --> 512.6999999999999
okay

511.02 --> 516.56
all right well there are 13 watching

512.7 --> 516.5600000000001
anyway good to see you first to chat

521.07 --> 524.129
[Music]

527.22 --> 532.32
oh yeah Tara dead that was yesterday's

530.519 --> 535.8
conversation

532.32 --> 540.6
right but again that may be a just a

535.8 --> 542.64
language issue there so

540.6 --> 546.6800000000001
I mean from your language perspective

542.64 --> 546.68
you are probably absolutely correct

547.019 --> 549.36
but

547.84 --> 551.519
[Music]

549.36 --> 553.92
I I don't want to get into that again

551.519 --> 557.54
please don't want to break her about it

553.92 --> 557.54
hello Amanda young good to see you

560.64 --> 562.64
um

564.6 --> 570.36
man I have just this

567.839 --> 574.1600000000001
intense dinner with like I may have

570.36 --> 574.16
overdone it a bit with the gravy

574.74 --> 580.74
I had like mashed potatoes with uh red

578.339 --> 586.9200000000001
beets

580.74 --> 590.399
and a beef sausage like in butter

586.92 --> 592.9799999999999
with a lot of pepper and salt

590.399 --> 596.339
and then like make pure gravy of that

592.98 --> 599.519
but man I had a lot of gravy it's like a

596.339 --> 601.62
bit of a fat assault but I mean I think

599.519 --> 604.32
that probably contributed

601.62 --> 607.5600000000001
to like my enormous dream states fats in

604.32 --> 611.339
in general do that fish oil do that

607.56 --> 613.9399999999999
but in a way butter also does that

611.339 --> 613.94
huh

615.48 --> 617.9590000000001
yeah

618.0 --> 623.459
I mean I had like a third of us of an

621.72 --> 627.4200000000001
entire stick of butter

623.459 --> 628.92
in that and I ate it all

627.42 --> 631.38
uh

628.92 --> 633.62
it was amazing though I mean I love that

631.38 --> 633.62
[ __ ]

634.019 --> 639.0600000000001
and it felt good

636.899 --> 641.399
I mean it is like really for the winter

639.06 --> 643.15
though I wouldn't you wouldn't catch me

641.399 --> 646.25
eating that during summer

643.15 --> 646.25
[Music]

648.48 --> 654.74
well George Sanford Cleary

652.2 --> 654.74
foreign

660.079 --> 666.42
two dollars here

662.64 --> 669.56
wow that is that's pretty cheap

666.42 --> 669.56
per kilogram

674.519 --> 679.579
yeah I think it's like five times as

676.8 --> 679.579
expensive here

679.98 --> 687.66
but I mean for you it's almost local so

684.66 --> 687.66
foreign

693.42 --> 696.5
how are you all doing

704.55 --> 707.87
[Music]

708.839 --> 713.36
table saw

710.88 --> 713.36
all right

715.68 --> 721.9799999999999
I haven't touched table salt in ages

719.7 --> 723.1800000000001
I think the last time I actually used it

721.98 --> 726.14
was

723.18 --> 726.14
uh

726.18 --> 731.3389999999999
yeah was just as a as a chemical

729.18 --> 736.16
basically I was using it as a crystal

731.339 --> 736.1600000000001
for my crystal battery attempt

736.44 --> 741.2
I was in like 2000

738.66 --> 741.1999999999999
eight

744.3 --> 747.019
or seven

748.26 --> 752.76
or later I don't know somewhere over

750.42 --> 755.6999999999999
there uh

752.76 --> 760.88
but yeah I haven't really used I stopped

755.7 --> 760.88
using table salt entirely like in 2006.

766.079 --> 772.6999999999999
for consumption that is anyway

769.139 --> 772.7
Ares 106.

774.899 --> 779.72
thought it was night time and it's

776.579 --> 779.7199999999999
actually morning okay

783.97 --> 787.009
[Music]

787.92 --> 790.2199999999999
foreign

790.579 --> 796.92
intense dream that kind of like felt

793.5 --> 799.44
like it dislocated your time sense

796.92 --> 802.4399999999999
that can happen if your dream is really

799.44 --> 804.4200000000001
intense and you like get swept away with

802.44 --> 806.8800000000001
the story it can literally like distort

804.42 --> 810.3
your time senses but only if it's a

806.88 --> 811.38
really heavy dream like that is kind of

810.3 --> 814.26
lucid

811.38 --> 816.779
I've experienced that in the past I like

814.26 --> 818.16
having a super intense lucid dream and

816.779 --> 820.74
then like

818.16 --> 823.68
I would wake up like like very

820.74 --> 826.26
enthusiastically and just think it is

823.68 --> 828.3599999999999
some time of the day and it isn't like I

826.26 --> 830.459
would think it's like morning

828.36 --> 835.5790000000001
and then it turns out it's like three at

830.459 --> 835.579
night weird weird effects with that

837.36 --> 842.6
or when you got to be on time what are

840.12 --> 842.6
you talking about

845.519 --> 850.94
I started like 35 minutes late there

858.899 --> 863.26
I'm I'm only going for like 15 minutes

861.48 --> 864.839
thus far so

863.26 --> 866.76
[Music]

864.839 --> 870.5400000000001
ah

866.76 --> 874.38
right so yeah I have a little title

870.54 --> 877.079
and it's like an ongoing theme really

874.38 --> 881.76
so I thought like yeah why not just make

877.079 --> 885.8389999999999
make that the title media Armageddon

881.76 --> 888.54
because there is like I'm seeing I yeah

885.839 --> 891.12
I bumped into an article Dutch article

888.54 --> 893.7199999999999
people basically pointing that out it's

891.12 --> 893.72
like oh

894.0 --> 898.8
this is there's an Armageddon going

895.86 --> 901.139
climate crisis in World War

898.8 --> 903.7199999999999
but

901.139 --> 908.639
it's media

903.72 --> 910.8000000000001
it's it's a fake Armageddon the media is

908.639 --> 913.38
going Armageddon

910.8 --> 916.74
because the reality yeah there's stuff

913.38 --> 920.459
happening but it isn't like that

916.74 --> 923.82
and the media is seems to be kind of

920.459 --> 927.2399999999999
playing up its intensity

923.82 --> 930.1800000000001
like a volcano building pressure

927.24 --> 932.1
right and while it's very easy to point

930.18 --> 934.079
that out when you think about

932.1 --> 936.0600000000001
10 years ago

934.079 --> 939.3
and then 10 years before that and

936.06 --> 942.3199999999999
especially before 2001

939.3 --> 942.3199999999999
it's palpable

942.66 --> 948.48
like yeah that word like they would push

946.38 --> 950.88
back then

948.48 --> 954.24
but I guess they needed to push less to

950.88 --> 957.18
get people to latch up now

954.24 --> 959.16
people are getting starting to generally

957.18 --> 961.079
understand that it's not just

959.16 --> 963.86
politicians that are lying it's media

961.079 --> 963.8599999999999
that's lying too

964.079 --> 969.66
and it's getting worse

966.6 --> 972.72
so they're not engaging as much and that

969.66 --> 974.3389999999999
causes basically the media which is the

972.72 --> 976.98
ones that are always trying to reach

974.339 --> 978.0
those people they're pushing harder and

976.98 --> 980.519
this

978.0 --> 983.76
you can experience like there is an

980.519 --> 986.54
Armageddon go like the world is ending

983.76 --> 990.66
the media is trying to

986.54 --> 993.42
convince and people that watch that the

990.66 --> 995.459
world is ending

993.42 --> 997.139
and here's what you need to do to stop

995.459 --> 999.7199999999999
it blah blah blah right but it's

997.139 --> 1002.66
complete nonsense and it is all scams

999.72 --> 1004.4590000000001
wherever they lead you to

1002.66 --> 1006.8
but that is

1004.459 --> 1011.5999999999999
what is really happening

1006.8 --> 1014.12
because in reality it isn't Armageddon

1011.6 --> 1016.639
and a lot of the reports you get to see

1014.12 --> 1019.519
are completely made up and lies or

1016.639 --> 1021.6800000000001
crisis Acts

1019.519 --> 1023.3
right it's not just about like oh

1021.68 --> 1027.9189999999999
there's some shooting or something

1023.3 --> 1029.54
that's fake no it's like entire story

1027.919 --> 1033.0790000000002
coverages

1029.54 --> 1036.26
like how things happened the background

1033.079 --> 1039.319
of it they just make up [ __ ] here and

1036.26 --> 1043.22
there now especially with the hot items

1039.319 --> 1046.459
like delay the new thing right well when

1043.22 --> 1047.66
the new thing basically arrives whatever

1046.459 --> 1051.3200000000002
that is

1047.66 --> 1054.02
they manipulate the [ __ ] out of it

1051.32 --> 1055.9399999999998
and a lot of people will be immediately

1054.02 --> 1058.84
outraged that happens every time it's

1055.94 --> 1058.8400000000001
just it's not

1059.6 --> 1063.1999999999998
just because people are doing that it

1061.64 --> 1066.5200000000002
doesn't mean that they are actually

1063.2 --> 1066.52
going to stop doing that

1066.919 --> 1072.26
right

1068.299 --> 1075.1399999999999
they still keep doing the lies

1072.26 --> 1076.8799999999999
so they're like creating like a huge

1075.14 --> 1080.0590000000002
cognitive dissonance and at the same

1076.88 --> 1082.2990000000002
time hyping up amping up the pressure

1080.059 --> 1085.46
to make it all seem like a giant

1082.299 --> 1087.44
Armageddon but it's really in the media

1085.46 --> 1090.52
that the Armageddon is and only the

1087.44 --> 1092.48
people really connected into that media

1090.52 --> 1094.16
hysteria dream

1092.48 --> 1096.14
are the ones that are going to

1094.16 --> 1098.059
experience Armageddon

1096.14 --> 1101.419
those that don't

1098.059 --> 1104.78
they will just see that it's all a Web

1101.419 --> 1108.44
of Lies and it's tightening

1104.78 --> 1111.02
and getting pulled in right media is

1108.44 --> 1115.16
almost yeah it can be like a web

1111.02 --> 1118.28
in the interwebs right

1115.16 --> 1120.98
Communication web

1118.28 --> 1123.62
and at some point

1120.98 --> 1126.6200000000001
or some people and their stories they do

1123.62 --> 1128.9599999999998
that the real people they they catch you

1126.62 --> 1130.6999999999998
so they throw out the net they start

1128.96 --> 1133.28
playing

1130.7 --> 1135.559
there's there's their Tunes people get

1133.28 --> 1136.46
used to that and then they change the

1135.559 --> 1139.52
tune

1136.46 --> 1141.26
that people are invested in alter it and

1139.52 --> 1143.6
then they basically pull them in while

1141.26 --> 1146.419
they're hypnotized

1143.6 --> 1149.62
and that seems to be happening on a j on

1146.419 --> 1149.6200000000001
a worldwide scale

1153.62 --> 1160.1
and because of that worldwide skill you

1156.799 --> 1163.1
could definitely not without being fuzzy

1160.1 --> 1166.48
about it say that it is globalist in

1163.1 --> 1166.48
origin because yeah

1166.58 --> 1171.3799999999999
they are predominantly one the ones that

1169.58 --> 1174.08
do that

1171.38 --> 1175.4
and they even brag about it these days

1174.08 --> 1178.609
so

1175.4 --> 1178.6090000000002
[Music]

1179.24 --> 1185.86
hello level Earth Observer Tony Whitcomb

1182.96 --> 1185.8600000000001
good to see you

1186.17 --> 1195.679
[Music]

1193.1 --> 1198.08
yeah Mr sensible was never very sensible

1195.679 --> 1201.52
I know

1198.08 --> 1201.52
I I don't wanna

1203.6 --> 1207.6999999999998
I don't wanna have anything to do with

1205.28 --> 1207.7
that guy

1208.99 --> 1212.21
[Music]

1222.32 --> 1229.12
okay Derek yeah it's a little bit too

1226.16 --> 1229.1200000000001
much information there

1234.14 --> 1242.0800000000002
am I talking about climate change yeah

1237.14 --> 1242.0800000000002
among other things there Aries 106.

1242.12 --> 1247.12
climate change and

1244.34 --> 1247.12
War

1252.44 --> 1256.24
basically all the scams

1256.88 --> 1260.7990000000002
that are heavily invested upon

1261.2 --> 1265.059
by globalist participants

1269.39 --> 1273.029
[Music]

1278.799 --> 1283.72
men make fire no status

1285.32 --> 1290.26
there is no virus viruses don't exist

1294.32 --> 1299.4399999999998
the real virus that destroys people is

1297.02 --> 1302.36
fear

1299.44 --> 1304.64
and delusion

1302.36 --> 1308.32
those are the things that end up making

1304.64 --> 1308.3200000000002
people sick effectively

1309.02 --> 1312.94
because they get themselves poisoned

1313.22 --> 1315.7
because

1315.86 --> 1320.6
there is no viruses they don't exist

1318.38 --> 1322.0300000000002
they are a science fiction medical

1320.6 --> 1327.4889999999998
concept

1322.03 --> 1327.489
[Music]

1327.98 --> 1335.48
and oh my God are you I'll bet you I can

1331.76 --> 1337.82
tell you says there's like billions

1335.48 --> 1340.84
invested

1337.82 --> 1344.6
billions in

1340.84 --> 1346.58
ensuring that there is a storyline to

1344.6 --> 1349.82
reinforce the idea that there are really

1346.58 --> 1353.48
viruses this whole supposed Wuhan

1349.82 --> 1356.0
whatever situation right

1353.48 --> 1358.22
the only reason it exists is to

1356.0 --> 1361.94
perpetuate

1358.22 --> 1364.159
the common acceptance that viruses exist

1361.94 --> 1365.96
in the first instance that is the reason

1364.159 --> 1368.1200000000001
they exists that's why they literally

1365.96 --> 1372.44
even cooperate

1368.12 --> 1375.32
in that there is a literal conspiracy

1372.44 --> 1378.14
within the medical world

1375.32 --> 1380.0
that reaches into politics

1378.14 --> 1384.0800000000002
to perpetuate

1380.0 --> 1387.38
the conception the idea of viruses and

1384.08 --> 1389.72
give it some and give it powers

1387.38 --> 1392.3200000000002
right that's what they want Powers

1389.72 --> 1394.64
through the medical system over People

1392.32 --> 1398.799
based on this on the science fiction

1394.64 --> 1398.7990000000002
concept that isn't proven

1399.44 --> 1402.52
sounds familiar

1402.74 --> 1409.76
this is very similar to things that were

1406.28 --> 1413.059
done during the theocracy era

1409.76 --> 1414.86
they literally make up [ __ ]

1413.059 --> 1417.44
and then

1414.86 --> 1420.62
talk about it a lot so that people get

1417.44 --> 1424.039
really afraid of it and then they

1420.62 --> 1428.0
persecute people with it

1424.039 --> 1430.64
and blackmail it's it's just a political

1428.0 --> 1432.38
ruse effectively

1430.64 --> 1435.2
that's what they're using it for now

1432.38 --> 1439.22
first it was just there to condition and

1435.2 --> 1442.22
bind people to trust the medical system

1439.22 --> 1444.5
and wasn't super yeah I was probably a

1442.22 --> 1446.84
bit harmful what they did with it I mean

1444.5 --> 1449.419
vaccine injuries

1446.84 --> 1453.32
have existed for a while

1449.419 --> 1457.22
it's not like a super new thing although

1453.32 --> 1458.96
it has allegedly so I heard gotten worse

1457.22 --> 1461.9
although that might also be because

1458.96 --> 1464.539
there's more media exposure right

1461.9 --> 1467.2
right compared to like a hundred years

1464.539 --> 1467.2
ago or something

1467.96 --> 1473.179
but it is clearly

1470.659 --> 1474.14
because science VR viruses are science

1473.179 --> 1478.0
fiction

1474.14 --> 1478.0
it's clearly a ruse

1479.36 --> 1487.4799999999998
just like the Roses the theocracy

1482.72 --> 1487.48
priesthood would use in medieval times

1487.58 --> 1493.28
it's the same thing it's you could even

1490.159 --> 1497.179
say it's the same model

1493.28 --> 1500.9189999999999
it is it is basically like a theocracy

1497.179 --> 1500.919
but it is a religion of

1501.26 --> 1508.039
of materialist atheism

1503.72 --> 1510.679
that is the background story from which

1508.039 --> 1513.58
these trickeries are being

1510.679 --> 1513.5800000000002
deployed

1516.86 --> 1519.3999999999999
right

1522.08 --> 1526.1589999999999
what about vaccines against bacteria are

1524.9 --> 1528.52
those real

1526.159 --> 1528.5200000000002
no

1529.4 --> 1537.38
although there may be

1532.22 --> 1539.179
like just the direct antibodies like

1537.38 --> 1542.659
look the thing is

1539.179 --> 1544.52
vaccines against bacteria might there

1542.659 --> 1547.3400000000001
might be something to it it is just like

1544.52 --> 1550.34
what type of vaccine is it

1547.34 --> 1552.559
there are ones that are like apparently

1550.34 --> 1554.059
extremely safe they have a super safe

1552.559 --> 1558.22
record

1554.059 --> 1558.22
right that is still important

1558.62 --> 1563.299
most of the medical

1560.679 --> 1565.22
things out there that are being used

1563.299 --> 1567.44
that are being used for a very long time

1565.22 --> 1569.84
well they keep being used because they

1567.44 --> 1572.48
have such a good track record of not

1569.84 --> 1574.82
having nasty side effects of just

1572.48 --> 1577.159
actually working

1574.82 --> 1579.32
like certain child diseases

1577.159 --> 1583.0390000000002
but

1579.32 --> 1585.32
that's because of test and effect not

1583.039 --> 1589.1589999999999
because of the Assumption of the model

1585.32 --> 1590.36
of what's taking place you see

1589.159 --> 1592.7600000000002
that's

1590.36 --> 1596.24
kind of complicated like that right so

1592.76 --> 1598.64
to say oh bacteria do this and that well

1596.24 --> 1600.74
I don't think bacteria in general are

1598.64 --> 1603.7990000000002
harmful at all

1600.74 --> 1605.9
like if it's just the bacteria

1603.799 --> 1608.179
maybe if you have like overwhelming

1605.9 --> 1611.0
amounts of them suddenly like introduced

1608.179 --> 1612.2
India or something right that might be

1611.0 --> 1615.679
like

1612.2 --> 1618.5
dangerous but if you just have like a

1615.679 --> 1620.179
bunch of bacteria which could be like

1618.5 --> 1623.26
billions by the way because they are

1620.179 --> 1623.26
extremely small already

1623.299 --> 1627.86
a Millions I don't know how much that

1625.58 --> 1630.3799999999999
would be you could like have that on you

1627.86 --> 1633.52
and your body can perfectly deal with

1630.38 --> 1636.0200000000002
that and you might even like

1633.52 --> 1638.84
unwittingly assimilate some of these

1636.02 --> 1640.82
bacteria because your body

1638.84 --> 1643.76
has bacteria

1640.82 --> 1645.86
your body has their their bacteria that

1643.76 --> 1649.34
they collected that is but like become

1645.86 --> 1652.2199999999998
the bacteria have nationalized to this

1649.34 --> 1654.86
unit to my body right

1652.22 --> 1658.659
so I don't see bacteria as something

1654.86 --> 1658.6589999999999
that even like causes disease

1659.059 --> 1665.36
I think that that works differently it's

1662.0 --> 1668.659
it's just the emphasis is wrong bacteria

1665.36 --> 1670.1
come in when you are

1668.659 --> 1671.8400000000001
like

1670.1 --> 1674.36
diseased

1671.84 --> 1677.059
the bacteria are actually the ones that

1674.36 --> 1679.2199999999998
are cleaning things up typically they

1677.059 --> 1681.44
engage to do things

1679.22 --> 1684.26
when you've already weakened when

1681.44 --> 1685.5800000000002
there's some damage somewhere

1684.26 --> 1689.08
right

1685.58 --> 1693.559
they don't actually initiate the damage

1689.08 --> 1696.22
and that's a really big big shift of how

1693.559 --> 1696.22
you see it

1696.44 --> 1701.779
because yeah bacteria do exist you can

1698.96 --> 1704.919
see them under a microscope but

1701.779 --> 1708.44
they are not these

1704.919 --> 1710.659
terrorist soldiers that literally all

1708.44 --> 1713.3600000000001
they touch down and they start to burrow

1710.659 --> 1716.0590000000002
in and destroy everything like

1713.36 --> 1719.299
unless they have been and this has also

1716.059 --> 1721.7
been tested upon like been weaponized

1719.299 --> 1723.44
yeah that's a thing you can weaponize

1721.7 --> 1725.539
bacteria you can even weaponize it

1723.44 --> 1729.02
rather common bacteria how do you do it

1725.539 --> 1731.36
by putting them in an increasingly toxic

1729.02 --> 1733.279
environment then they reproduce adapted

1731.36 --> 1735.02
to the toxic environment and then you

1733.279 --> 1737.419
put them those

1735.02 --> 1739.94
that batch into an even slightly more

1737.419 --> 1743.2990000000002
toxic right and you then basically make

1739.94 --> 1745.52
them super weaponized hostile

1743.299 --> 1747.559
and then when you introduce them well

1745.52 --> 1749.6589999999999
then they are completely adapted to that

1747.559 --> 1752.72
other environment and they basically

1749.659 --> 1755.419
start behaving unnaturally

1752.72 --> 1756.98
then then they might actually attack you

1755.419 --> 1759.679
right but that's not a normal

1756.98 --> 1761.24
circumstance for you to bump into a

1759.679 --> 1763.64
bacteria like that because the ones that

1761.24 --> 1765.6200000000001
are generally floating out there they

1763.64 --> 1767.779
don't undergo such processes because

1765.62 --> 1770.2399999999998
that's like rare you have to really

1767.779 --> 1772.34
create that in a lab to do that

1770.24 --> 1775.7
right

1772.34 --> 1777.9189999999999
but then there's another effect very

1775.7 --> 1780.26
interesting I've heard all of these from

1777.919 --> 1783.0200000000002
people that are doctors and their

1780.26 --> 1785.779
Laboratories studying that

1783.02 --> 1788.0
if you have a weaponized bacteria batch

1785.779 --> 1789.679
on you yeah you might get sick at first

1788.0 --> 1793.76
but guess what happens

1789.679 --> 1796.7
they keep reproducing but adapted to the

1793.76 --> 1797.72
more natural normal environment it is

1796.7 --> 1800.6000000000001
like

1797.72 --> 1802.58
uh hostile foreigners coming in oh

1800.6 --> 1804.5
they're like really rude and they bash

1802.58 --> 1807.1999999999998
people in the face if they give them a

1804.5 --> 1808.279
wrong eye right but guess what their

1807.2 --> 1811.3400000000001
children

1808.279 --> 1814.52
get the country a lot more and they're

1811.34 --> 1816.799
probably much more like like us right

1814.52 --> 1819.32
and then their children they will be

1816.799 --> 1821.4189999999999
almost exactly like us well guess what

1819.32 --> 1823.7
that happens with bacteria too you have

1821.419 --> 1827.0590000000002
a hostile weaponized bacteria

1823.7 --> 1829.5800000000002
they come in ah might yeah it might get

1827.059 --> 1831.74
painful and [ __ ] and weird and might get

1829.58 --> 1834.559
really sick even because it's the

1831.74 --> 1836.8990000000001
weaponization but then after a while if

1834.559 --> 1840.2
you survive that that toxic first

1836.899 --> 1842.36
process the first generation

1840.2 --> 1844.94
and after that

1842.36 --> 1846.02
they all mellow down and then there is

1844.94 --> 1849.44
no more

1846.02 --> 1851.72
toxic weaponized bacteria

1849.44 --> 1852.799
their offspring will have become normal

1851.72 --> 1855.559
again

1852.799 --> 1860.559
and then it's not dangerous anymore

1855.559 --> 1860.559
yeah that's what really happens

1861.08 --> 1867.9399999999998
I learned all these things

1864.2 --> 1867.94
from listening to doctors

1868.1 --> 1873.86
and it's amazing how that all fits

1870.559 --> 1876.9189999999999
together and how it closes the loop no

1873.86 --> 1879.1
more open ends to everything that's out

1876.919 --> 1879.1000000000001
there

1880.039 --> 1885.26
and the placebo yeah of course

1881.96 --> 1887.0
psychosomatics are in a major driver

1885.26 --> 1889.34
especially for people who don't

1887.0 --> 1891.2
understand how bodies work

1889.34 --> 1892.6999999999998
and medical things work it's a major

1891.2 --> 1896.98
driver

1892.7 --> 1896.98
for sickness and for healing

1902.659 --> 1907.3990000000001
anyway

1905.12 --> 1910.7199999999998
remember if we talked to a doctor about

1907.399 --> 1910.7199999999998
it yeah yeah I have

1916.82 --> 1922.34
yeah and they agreed with the with the

1920.48 --> 1926.02
statements that I've made not with the

1922.34 --> 1926.02
conclusion necessary but yeah

1928.58 --> 1933.02
now I've got those are doctors that are

1931.22 --> 1935.419
that were already kind of in the

1933.02 --> 1936.74
alternative holistic circuit though but

1935.419 --> 1939.14
doctors

1936.74 --> 1941.059
because if you just go into a regular

1939.14 --> 1943.3400000000001
Hospital doctor

1941.059 --> 1945.6789999999999
fresh off the school press or whatever

1943.34 --> 1946.9399999999998
yeah they don't know anything about that

1945.679 --> 1950.919
[ __ ]

1946.94 --> 1950.919
they're fully immersed in the

1952.039 --> 1956.48
in the medical system way of thinking in

1954.32 --> 1959.36
the allopathic system so they don't know

1956.48 --> 1960.98
anything about that

1959.36 --> 1964.7199999999998
alternative

1960.98 --> 1964.72
studying doctors they do

1965.899 --> 1972.1589999999999
that's usually the reason why they they

1968.36 --> 1973.8799999999999
go in the alternative circuit is because

1972.159 --> 1975.74
allopathism

1973.88 --> 1978.0800000000002
and those schools and those teachers

1975.74 --> 1980.8990000000001
typically always just be like don't

1978.08 --> 1981.98
engage they treat it like it's flat

1980.899 --> 1984.3799999999999
Earth

1981.98 --> 1986.3600000000001
for a glober

1984.38 --> 1988.8200000000002
like they literally just completely

1986.36 --> 1992.32
ignore it because it doesn't fall in

1988.82 --> 1992.32
line with allopathic thinking

1994.159 --> 1999.14
and yeah that's very restricting and a

1996.62 --> 2001.539
lot of doctors really are just curious

1999.14 --> 2003.64
about how the body really works and how

2001.539 --> 2005.74
all what's going on and they really want

2003.64 --> 2008.6200000000001
to heal so they don't want to be

2005.74 --> 2010.299
restricted by allopathism and they go

2008.62 --> 2011.9799999999998
alternative and then they figure out

2010.299 --> 2014.679
like what's

2011.98 --> 2017.679
so incredibly wrong

2014.679 --> 2021.8200000000002
with all the models of approach

2017.679 --> 2024.7
the entire medical way of thinking

2021.82 --> 2028.4399999999998
is wrong and that's what birthed

2024.7 --> 2028.44
the holistic movement

2030.7 --> 2036.3400000000001
which is kind of a generalized concept

2032.98 --> 2039.159
because holistic doctors could

2036.34 --> 2042.279
do all kinds of different

2039.159 --> 2044.7990000000002
things that have no direct relation with

2042.279 --> 2047.44
one another but it is about the angle of

2044.799 --> 2049.96
approach spiritually

2047.44 --> 2054.82
and methodically

2049.96 --> 2057.04
that you'd don't go by typical Playbook

2054.82 --> 2059.32
rules of how to deal with the situation

2057.04 --> 2062.02
an isolated situation which is what a

2059.32 --> 2064.599
lot of allopathic Medical Systems do

2062.02 --> 2067.599
but instead make it directly centered

2064.599 --> 2069.46
around the patient and their spirit and

2067.599 --> 2072.46
just like how do you get them to heal

2069.46 --> 2075.639
how do you get this to stop

2072.46 --> 2078.94
like what is keeping the hurt

2075.639 --> 2081.159
in its place right so it's it's a more

2078.94 --> 2083.859
Dynamic approach

2081.159 --> 2086.5
freely making the doctor focus on what

2083.859 --> 2089.08
is going to heal the person instead of

2086.5 --> 2091.839
like in in what kind of on what kind of

2089.08 --> 2094.179
ladder do I put him within the system of

2091.839 --> 2095.859
knowledge that was given me

2094.179 --> 2097.78
and make it less personal because

2095.859 --> 2099.7
allopathism makes things a lot less

2097.78 --> 2101.32
personal

2099.7 --> 2104.6189999999997
while holism

2101.32 --> 2107.6400000000003
makes is the person is Central that

2104.619 --> 2107.6400000000003
that's the whole point

2108.28 --> 2115.2400000000002
anyway so yeah a bit about media about

2111.28 --> 2117.3390000000004
uh not about media about medical

2115.24 --> 2119.7999999999997
ideas

2117.339 --> 2123.54
huh

2119.8 --> 2123.54
doctors also no they don't

2125.02 --> 2130.18
if you inquire they'll be just like a

2128.2 --> 2131.66
baller standing there with their mouth

2130.18 --> 2135.79
open like what

2131.66 --> 2135.79
[Music]

2140.98 --> 2146.56
so I don't give a [ __ ] if you're gonna

2143.2 --> 2149.2599999999998
say doctor degree viruses are real so

2146.56 --> 2152.02
[ __ ] you about that they don't know any

2149.26 --> 2154.0600000000004
better usually

2152.02 --> 2156.099
because if they do and they come out

2154.06 --> 2157.839
with it if you are a doctor in function

2156.099 --> 2159.579
then you start to directly say things

2157.839 --> 2161.98
like that you will get in trouble

2159.579 --> 2164.94
because of the medical board

2161.98 --> 2167.859
or because of I don't know some

2164.94 --> 2172.599
World Health Organization [ __ ] something

2167.859 --> 2175.18
like that so yeah they are now Under

2172.599 --> 2177.04
Pressure not to spill the beans

2175.18 --> 2179.3799999999997
basically about that

2177.04 --> 2182.8
I'll bet you a lot of doctors have

2179.38 --> 2187.1800000000003
studied up you know why because doctors

2182.8 --> 2189.099
study up continually they have to do

2187.18 --> 2192.7
that it is like a

2189.099 --> 2194.8
a yearly or half yearly course

2192.7 --> 2196.24
that no matter what you have to keep

2194.8 --> 2199.2000000000003
following that

2196.24 --> 2199.2
because if you don't

2200.56 --> 2204.64
yeah you'll not be able to function

2203.2 --> 2206.56
properly

2204.64 --> 2209.14
you will not be updated enough well

2206.56 --> 2211.06
those people

2209.14 --> 2213.64
are

2211.06 --> 2214.96
capable of doing that and they usually

2213.64 --> 2216.22
want to do that they're naturally

2214.96 --> 2219.52
curious they want to keep learning

2216.22 --> 2221.74
though those people tend to also find

2219.52 --> 2225.16
alternative things

2221.74 --> 2227.02
and alternative holistic doctors that

2225.16 --> 2230.8199999999997
they will communicate with

2227.02 --> 2230.82
and then figure out wait

2232.66 --> 2236.6189999999997
I'm in a tricky position

2235.0 --> 2238.54
what am I going to do I'm just going to

2236.619 --> 2239.76
ignore this and just go for the money

2238.54 --> 2243.16
and the

2239.76 --> 2246.3590000000004
stability or am I actually going to

2243.16 --> 2249.839
improve my ways and uphold the

2246.359 --> 2249.839
Hippocratic Oath better

2265.06 --> 2268.06
anyway

2289.2 --> 2294.8199999999997
bacterial face viruses I don't know what

2292.42 --> 2298.56
that even is I have no idea what you're

2294.82 --> 2298.56
talking about in Aries 106.

2304.3 --> 2310.0600000000004
I have a strong suspicion universally

2307.44 --> 2313.66
universally that whenever

2310.06 --> 2318.18
supposed viruses are invoked that

2313.66 --> 2318.18
there's actually just poison involved

2318.94 --> 2322.839
and then they just say like oh that

2320.98 --> 2324.88
that's oh look there's something

2322.839 --> 2329.5789999999997
happening oh look these thingies are

2324.88 --> 2332.5
showing because I have a strong

2329.579 --> 2334.78
indication that whatever they say

2332.5 --> 2336.64
supposedly viruses are even when they

2334.78 --> 2338.26
try to point them out through

2336.64 --> 2342.16
microscopes

2338.26 --> 2346.6600000000003
it's actually just

2342.16 --> 2348.8199999999997
sell and bacteria guts and blood it's

2346.66 --> 2354.72
it's Gore what you're looking it's not

2348.82 --> 2354.7200000000003
actually a like a living or

2355.839 --> 2361.24
yeah bacteria aren't even or viruses are

2359.079 --> 2364.3
even claimed to be alive it's not that

2361.24 --> 2366.7599999999998
it's not a a unit that is like

2364.3 --> 2370.6800000000003
self-replicating in that sense it that

2366.76 --> 2370.6800000000003
doesn't exist it's a myth

2373.02 --> 2381.339
viruses are not a thing it's just

2377.44 --> 2385.7200000000003
cell organ guts and blood what you're

2381.339 --> 2388.96
looking at that tend to bend like form

2385.72 --> 2391.54
little balls like droplets

2388.96 --> 2393.579
it's not a living thing it's

2391.54 --> 2397.54
it's yeah

2393.579 --> 2400.9
it's not a unit it's just Gore

2397.54 --> 2402.88
okay the imagery of viruses is just Gore

2400.9 --> 2405.64
and then what you get to see the the

2402.88 --> 2407.859
ball with all the sticks on it right of

2405.64 --> 2409.359
the weird fluffy ball with all these

2407.859 --> 2415.02
sticks

2409.359 --> 2419.0789999999997
out of it that is pure the purest of

2415.02 --> 2423.7599999999998
artistic interpretation cgis

2419.079 --> 2427.119
all right artistic interpretation based

2423.76 --> 2429.0
CGI that has absolutely nothing to do

2427.119 --> 2433.2400000000002
with the supposed

2429.0 --> 2434.68
microscope claim of what a virus even is

2433.24 --> 2436.5989999999997
right

2434.68 --> 2439.4199999999996
it's just taking you in the virtual

2436.599 --> 2441.7000000000003
model world and then making you reified

2439.42 --> 2445.0
like it's an atom or something

2441.7 --> 2447.5789999999997
right I mean even Atomic models in to a

2445.0 --> 2450.64
certain degree are reified

2447.579 --> 2455.079
it works chemically perfectly

2450.64 --> 2458.0789999999997
but the way they show it to you with CGI

2455.079 --> 2459.88
is a reification

2458.079 --> 2461.5600000000004
there's no evidence that any of that

2459.88 --> 2463.7200000000003
looks like that it's an artistic

2461.56 --> 2467.619
interpretation and the same thing goes

2463.72 --> 2470.52
for what they show you in media viruses

2467.619 --> 2470.52
are supposed to be

2472.38 --> 2478.86
[Music]

2479.68 --> 2484.24
I know what the hell I'm talking about

2482.079 --> 2487.9
don't be a [ __ ] smart ass with me

2484.24 --> 2490.2999999999997
aries106 or kick you the [ __ ] out

2487.9 --> 2493.359
yeah I know exactly what I'm talking

2490.3 --> 2496.9
about it's not [ __ ]

2493.359 --> 2499.5989999999997
there's a lot of really smart people out

2496.9 --> 2501.82
there that know this

2499.599 --> 2504.339
just watch spacebusters

2501.82 --> 2508.599
he's made excellent videos about this

2504.339 --> 2511.34
subject with all the video material

2508.599 --> 2513.579
to present for it okay

2511.34 --> 2516.579
[Music]

2513.579 --> 2516.579
ah

2525.56 --> 2537.999
[Music]

2542.619 --> 2547.92
anyway hope you guys are enjoying the

2545.74 --> 2550.72
show

2547.92 --> 2553.38
I feel a little weird

2550.72 --> 2553.3799999999997
right

2557.619 --> 2562.26
I need to make sure that I go to bed

2559.839 --> 2562.2599999999998
earlier

2563.02 --> 2568.619
so that I have more wake up time before

2565.78 --> 2568.619
I start the show

2571.48 --> 2577.56
anyway I hope you guys are enjoying this

2574.48 --> 2577.56
show so far

2590.8 --> 2597.1600000000003
are there many new German medicine

2593.619 --> 2600.2200000000003
doctors well the thing is

2597.16 --> 2602.92
they're not really doctors

2600.22 --> 2606.04
because German new medicine is like

2602.92 --> 2608.44
almost purely non-interventionist

2606.04 --> 2610.48
so German new medicine is more just like

2608.44 --> 2612.88
a discipline

2610.48 --> 2614.92
than it is like a doctor

2612.88 --> 2616.78
although yeah you can be really good at

2614.92 --> 2619.119
it and then basically somebody tells you

2616.78 --> 2620.98
oh I feel this and that

2619.119 --> 2623.92
and then they basically can just tell

2620.98 --> 2627.96
them oh that's probably this and that

2623.92 --> 2627.96
it's not really a doctor though

2629.859 --> 2636.119
it's a discipline see me Trevor

2633.46 --> 2636.119
foreign

2655.24 --> 2661.56
yeah okay lumpy gas in the vacuum could

2658.24 --> 2661.56
be yeah I was just

2662.859 --> 2666.7799999999997
I don't know

2664.18 --> 2666.7799999999997
foreign

2666.839 --> 2671.44
family so we were always like getting

2669.88 --> 2673.359
together especially when it was still

2671.44 --> 2675.2200000000003
pre-teen

2673.359 --> 2678.0989999999997
like during dinner and then having all

2675.22 --> 2680.4399999999996
kinds of conversations and

2678.099 --> 2684.2200000000003
I would ask

2680.44 --> 2685.98
their ears off their head as a kid and

2684.22 --> 2689.1099999999997
like tell my own

2685.98 --> 2693.379
dreams and ideas

2689.11 --> 2693.379
[Music]

2693.579 --> 2701.46
I'd rather go to a real doctor you'd go

2696.16 --> 2701.46
and do that then bye see you there

2702.099 --> 2711.1600000000003
make sure to get your booster

2705.0 --> 2711.16
[Music]

2715.96 --> 2718.989
[Music]

2724.599 --> 2730.599
oh hello M2M

2726.7 --> 2732.39
yeah not a big fan of the winter well

2730.599 --> 2735.52
I could be

2732.39 --> 2735.52
[Music]

2741.099 --> 2746.7400000000002
it's just that if I be doing a little

2744.099 --> 2748.56
better and not be

2746.74 --> 2751.7799999999997
a little poor

2748.56 --> 2754.839
like I am now I'm not super poor I mean

2751.78 --> 2756.6400000000003
I still have pretty really good quality

2754.839 --> 2757.66
food it's just that I don't have a lot

2756.64 --> 2759.5789999999997
of it

2757.66 --> 2764.3999999999996
I don't do them

2759.579 --> 2764.4
a great many different things out there

2764.46 --> 2769.54
but if I'd be doing financially better

2767.14 --> 2771.16
then I'd have absolutely no problem

2769.54 --> 2773.859
whatsoever with the weather and I'd

2771.16 --> 2777.0989999999997
probably go more out outside because I

2773.859 --> 2779.619
had I'd have better shoes

2777.099 --> 2782.26
and clothing

2779.619 --> 2784.92
so that it would be very comfortable for

2782.26 --> 2784.92
me to go outside

2786.339 --> 2791.98
right but since I'm not in that position

2788.859 --> 2795.04
yeah it kind of sucks when it's cold

2791.98 --> 2796.42
because most of my clothes have holes in

2795.04 --> 2798.16
them

2796.42 --> 2800.079
I mean at this point it's pretty much

2798.16 --> 2804.24
steamy traveler's t-shirt that's the

2800.079 --> 2804.2400000000002
only thing that doesn't have holes in it

2805.42 --> 2809.04
pretty much everything else does

2810.76 --> 2816.2200000000003
yeah and keep the shirts

2814.14 --> 2819.42
[Music]

2816.22 --> 2819.4199999999996
it's very funny anyway

2830.92 --> 2834.94
[Music]

2833.02 --> 2836.74
all right well if you want to help do

2834.94 --> 2838.3
something about that you can donate to

2836.74 --> 2841.4199999999996
my PayPal

2838.3 --> 2844.0600000000004
you can really use it I've been having a

2841.42 --> 2847.2400000000002
real drought when it concerns that

2844.06 --> 2849.4
in the last two months now

2847.24 --> 2852.839
to a degree where I'm wondering if I can

2849.4 --> 2852.839
actually survive this

2858.46 --> 2863.859
but then again I've been in those

2860.14 --> 2866.6189999999997
positions before and then things changed

2863.859 --> 2868.839
again so we'll see what happens

2866.619 --> 2871.7400000000002
I really hope that well everyone that

2868.839 --> 2874.599
follows me basically gets a an upturn

2871.74 --> 2877.9799999999996
financially a lot of you out there are

2874.599 --> 2877.98
working I hope

2883.96 --> 2892.38
a question about the emoticons what

2888.88 --> 2892.38
what are you talking about Derek

2899.02 --> 2906.06
thank you lumpy gas in the vacuum I

2901.9 --> 2906.06
really feel like that too but

2908.8 --> 2913.119
yeah I don't know it it hasn't been

2911.38 --> 2916.8
happening so far

2913.119 --> 2916.8
I really hope though

2918.4 --> 2923.7400000000002
the problem is also though that I'm kind

2921.28 --> 2926.1400000000003
of like I just have it

2923.74 --> 2928.359
not irrational standards I just have

2926.14 --> 2930.339
high standards and

2928.359 --> 2934.2999999999997
well things out there have gone even

2930.339 --> 2936.64
worse and so yeah if I could probably

2934.3 --> 2938.26
just say like okay I'm gonna pick this

2936.64 --> 2940.9
woman

2938.26 --> 2942.2200000000003
because they're like good enough or

2940.9 --> 2945.1600000000003
something

2942.22 --> 2948.04
I'm just worried that I

2945.16 --> 2949.72
I'd lose interest over time

2948.04 --> 2951.7
in them

2949.72 --> 2954.2999999999997
I don't want to put them in the position

2951.7 --> 2954.2999999999997
like that

2958.9 --> 2963.359
so in a way I gotta find somebody that

2961.18 --> 2963.359
is

2964.18 --> 2968.16
in level at least my equal

2969.52 --> 2975.88
that has just as much potential

2973.24 --> 2977.4399999999996
right I mean the ideal thing would be to

2975.88 --> 2981.2200000000003
find somebody that has just as much

2977.44 --> 2983.98
potential and we basically like fuse or

2981.22 --> 2987.2799999999997
get married and it would then unlock

2983.98 --> 2990.4
both our potential so that would be

2987.28 --> 2993.599
just as strong as each other

2990.4 --> 2993.599
that would be ideal

2996.099 --> 3001.2200000000003
but I don't know if there's a woman like

2998.56 --> 3001.22
that out there

3004.02 --> 3009.599
but then again could be

3006.9 --> 3011.2200000000003
there's a lot of women out there

3009.599 --> 3012.7200000000003
and

3011.22 --> 3015.72
hopefully

3012.72 --> 3017.9399999999996
yeah it like those women that are gonna

3015.72 --> 3020.839
like are probably not gonna be

3017.94 --> 3020.839
vaccinated

3027.66 --> 3033.02
right

3028.8 --> 3033.02
but anyway I'm just kind of picky and

3035.04 --> 3039.7799999999997
we'll see if it's still out there and

3037.079 --> 3042.0600000000004
not super corrupted because a lot of the

3039.78 --> 3043.5600000000004
women that I'm attracted to are well

3042.06 --> 3045.54
they are

3043.56 --> 3049.38
[Music]

3045.54 --> 3051.599
usually very connected through rich

3049.38 --> 3054.26
people that just really have their eye

3051.599 --> 3054.26
out for them

3055.14 --> 3061.46
in a way that was also the problem with

3057.18 --> 3061.46
my ex I mean she was really attractive

3066.66 --> 3069.44
and smart

3069.66 --> 3076.5589999999997
and yeah it's hard to keep those

3072.96 --> 3078.18
without yeah but even if you like try to

3076.559 --> 3079.559
enslave yourself to them and like do

3078.18 --> 3081.54
whatever they want they just lose

3079.559 --> 3083.1800000000003
interest anyway so it's just that's

3081.54 --> 3086.16
intenable

3083.18 --> 3089.339
but it was like the thing that kept me

3086.16 --> 3092.819
like I I could have

3089.339 --> 3094.98
stuck to that the rest of my life

3092.819 --> 3099.599
but how can I find now I need to find

3094.98 --> 3101.94
somebody that could do that back

3099.599 --> 3104.7200000000003
it has to work

3101.94 --> 3104.7200000000003
somehow

3111.42 --> 3116.0
anyway

3113.099 --> 3118.079
have you tried meeting women at church

3116.0 --> 3120.119
that's kind of funny that you mentioned

3118.079 --> 3121.6800000000003
that steamy traveler because when I went

3120.119 --> 3123.6600000000003
to the Mormon church right across the

3121.68 --> 3127.859
street here

3123.66 --> 3130.7999999999997
that was it just one year two years but

3127.859 --> 3134.16
there was like a girl there

3130.8 --> 3137.099
that I found like monstrously attractive

3134.16 --> 3140.04
like really attractive but she was

3137.099 --> 3142.619
actually getting married

3140.04 --> 3144.96
to some guy

3142.619 --> 3147.54
I'm not gonna get into it and that was

3144.96 --> 3151.26
kind of a heartbreak I mean

3147.54 --> 3153.72
yeah I would have definitely I I try to

3151.26 --> 3157.38
make a move on there even I thought like

3153.72 --> 3161.52
when a woman is like perfect in a way

3157.38 --> 3163.559
like I don't care anymore I just I like

3161.52 --> 3166.68
it's not about oh oh I don't know what

3163.559 --> 3169.6800000000003
to say oh no how do I talk to her no

3166.68 --> 3171.48
it's just like I am your man

3169.68 --> 3173.2799999999997
that's what's happened

3171.48 --> 3175.38
that would have that's how it happened

3173.28 --> 3179.3390000000004
with my ex it's just like

3175.38 --> 3181.619
that is it and then what do you mean oh

3179.339 --> 3182.5789999999997
I feel stuck to Rihanna no it's just

3181.619 --> 3185.7200000000003
like

3182.579 --> 3185.7200000000003
you're it

3186.119 --> 3189.48
come with me

3187.8 --> 3192.78
if you want to live

3189.48 --> 3193.68
but not as a death threat if you want to

3192.78 --> 3195.6600000000003
live

3193.68 --> 3197.7599999999998
Glory basically

3195.66 --> 3200.7599999999998
[Music]

3197.76 --> 3202.7400000000002
and that's how it's happened every time

3200.76 --> 3205.8
and every time it didn't happen like

3202.74 --> 3209.5989999999997
that I very quickly ended up losing

3205.8 --> 3209.599
complete interest in the in the girl

3210.54 --> 3215.7
so it's just I have to just go about and

3213.54 --> 3217.98
just have some good time not even think

3215.7 --> 3220.14
about women and then suddenly one of

3217.98 --> 3221.76
those show up and then that happens and

3220.14 --> 3225.319
then I'm hooked

3221.76 --> 3225.3190000000004
then yeah

3225.359 --> 3230.7599999999998
because when I'm like that

3227.52 --> 3234.839
and this is not like mind control or

3230.76 --> 3237.3590000000004
forcing they just never say no

3234.839 --> 3239.52
it's like it was meant to be

3237.359 --> 3242.72
when that happens

3239.52 --> 3242.72
and that's how I know

3242.94 --> 3248.48
I get into that mindset and they just

3245.88 --> 3248.48
say yes

3255.119 --> 3259.1400000000003
but there has to be like a thing that

3257.22 --> 3261.0589999999997
happens naturally because if I just

3259.14 --> 3263.7599999999998
really find them attractive but I don't

3261.059 --> 3265.8
really get them then I don't then

3263.76 --> 3267.78
there's not that connection and then I

3265.8 --> 3269.4
fall back in the position of getting a

3267.78 --> 3271.3190000000004
bit awkward and I really don't know how

3269.4 --> 3274.8
to compose myself

3271.319 --> 3277.8
but if that spark you could call it is

3274.8 --> 3280.3390000000004
there then everything changes

3277.8 --> 3280.3390000000004
anyway

3285.02 --> 3292.68
[Music]

3287.64 --> 3295.52
I have I met any female fans of my show

3292.68 --> 3295.52
uh

3297.3 --> 3299.8390000000004
no

3302.52 --> 3307.559
but might be because I think that a

3305.4 --> 3309.9
couple of females that like my show are

3307.559 --> 3312.02
just really shy or something I don't

3309.9 --> 3312.02
know

3313.14 --> 3316.8889999999997
foreign

3313.78 --> 3316.889
[Music]

3320.579 --> 3325.559
there's a chance that there's girls out

3323.22 --> 3327.66
there that actually do follow me

3325.559 --> 3329.76
and I do really like my show or

3327.66 --> 3331.92
something

3329.76 --> 3335.42
but that are just that would be very

3331.92 --> 3335.42
scared to actually meet me

3335.579 --> 3340.319
you've had that before that I would like

3337.68 --> 3343.5
just be myself and then impress certain

3340.319 --> 3346.38
girls so much that they'd get really shy

3343.5 --> 3349.559
and almost scared

3346.38 --> 3351.96
but because they were just so impressed

3349.559 --> 3357.2000000000003
in a good way

3351.96 --> 3357.2
but like yeah anyway I don't know

3357.96 --> 3361.64
I don't really think about it a lot

3363.599 --> 3368.88
I think most women that I still talk to

3365.94 --> 3371.64
are like at the supermarket

3368.88 --> 3373.619
they don't follow me

3371.64 --> 3376.68
pretty sure that they don't follow me

3373.619 --> 3378.1800000000003
they might know that I am on YouTube or

3376.68 --> 3379.02
something but they don't actually follow

3378.18 --> 3381.6189999999997
me

3379.02 --> 3381.619
so

3382.92 --> 3389.2400000000002
all right anyway and take a two minute

3385.44 --> 3389.2400000000002
break and I'll be right back

3415.44 --> 3418.44
foreign

3465.3 --> 3468.02
foreign

3491.04 --> 3494.04
foreign

3527.04 --> 3529.2799999999997
foreign

3538.559 --> 3544.3190000000004
well look as soon as they as soon as any

3542.4 --> 3547.619
woman

3544.319 --> 3550.859
like there's no way I don't like women

3547.619 --> 3553.92
that are into pronoun [ __ ] or whatever

3550.859 --> 3556.2
like they look a certain way I do not

3553.92 --> 3559.14
find those women attractive in the

3556.2 --> 3561.66
slightest I find them quite repulsive so

3559.14 --> 3564.72
I've never actually started a

3561.66 --> 3567.0
conversation with a woman and then ended

3564.72 --> 3569.7
up having that problem move

3567.0 --> 3572.04
getting the pronouns wrong because I

3569.7 --> 3574.5589999999997
don't talk to women like that

3572.04 --> 3576.799
I can feel it off them when they're like

3574.559 --> 3576.799
that

3578.94 --> 3583.5
I have to say I don't really see as many

3581.64 --> 3587.7799999999997
of them

3583.5 --> 3587.78
as you would think from media

3588.119 --> 3593.42
I don't think they're like hanging

3590.04 --> 3593.42
around here everywhere

3594.72 --> 3599.4599999999996
I mean there are some of them especially

3596.94 --> 3601.98
in the city center here

3599.46 --> 3604.68
and they have their places where they

3601.98 --> 3608.0
like to gather and like have parties and

3604.68 --> 3608.0
stupid stuff whatever

3608.52 --> 3612.78
but that's like in the city center not

3611.099 --> 3615.1800000000003
out here

3612.78 --> 3619.0400000000004
this is like

3615.18 --> 3619.04
the ring outside of that

3625.559 --> 3629.78
ideal age range for a wife

3633.359 --> 3640.2
tough to say I'd say between 21 and 33.

3643.98 --> 3647.359
that would be ideal

3654.839 --> 3659.46
and yeah I don't give a [ __ ] I take a

3657.599 --> 3663.2400000000002
wife half my age

3659.46 --> 3666.42
I don't give a [ __ ] dude

3663.24 --> 3669.4199999999996
as long as they are mentally adult

3666.42 --> 3671.64
enough right and there are young women

3669.42 --> 3673.619
that are actually really adult very

3671.64 --> 3675.66
quickly

3673.619 --> 3679.2000000000003
naturally

3675.66 --> 3682.5589999999997
just like I was well communicatively

3679.2 --> 3684.18
capable like an adult almost even as a

3682.559 --> 3686.88
little kid

3684.18 --> 3690.0589999999997
not that I was like adult-minded or

3686.88 --> 3691.859
responsible like socially but it was

3690.059 --> 3694.3190000000004
able to communicate very young right

3691.859 --> 3697.38
well there's some women out there that

3694.319 --> 3700.64
also have those kinds of traits

3697.38 --> 3700.6400000000003
really good at something

3701.579 --> 3708.6600000000003
so yeah it all depends

3704.78 --> 3712.38
but I probably wouldn't be attracted to

3708.66 --> 3716.04
women under 21 I think at this point

3712.38 --> 3718.079
because they'd be too uh like just

3716.04 --> 3720.72
two teenage

3718.079 --> 3723.1800000000003
probably involved with stupid pronoun

3720.72 --> 3726.48
[ __ ] even and

3723.18 --> 3729.839
or just too arrogant like you old what

3726.48 --> 3734.28
you're older than 30 that's old um

3729.839 --> 3737.2799999999997
like okay right this is I'll see you in

3734.28 --> 3740.059
20 years see what you look like then huh

3737.28 --> 3740.059
laughs

3745.5 --> 3752.52
not many common grounds of Interest

3748.5 --> 3754.559
well but to be fair status I mean I've

3752.52 --> 3757.52
never really had women with a lot of

3754.559 --> 3757.52
common ground of Interest

3763.44 --> 3769.079
as long as you just have a couple that

3765.78 --> 3770.28
you can enjoy

3769.079 --> 3772.6800000000003
right

3770.28 --> 3776.0
I mean my ex was into

3772.68 --> 3776.0
different things

3776.64 --> 3780.5989999999997
well she was into things that I wasn't

3778.559 --> 3783.079
into but I did find very attractive

3780.599 --> 3783.079
about her

3783.18 --> 3787.2599999999998
and she thought I was very attractive

3786.359 --> 3789.7799999999997
too

3787.26 --> 3791.6400000000003
things about me

3789.78 --> 3794.1600000000003
not gonna go into all they did but there

3791.64 --> 3796.0789999999997
were plenty like a whole bunch she was

3794.16 --> 3798.96
really attracted to me

3796.079 --> 3801.5
and also in like how I could be really

3798.96 --> 3803.94
sharp and how I could like understand

3801.5 --> 3806.04
when she was talking about medical

3803.94 --> 3808.88
things she was the dentist

3806.04 --> 3808.88
literally

3809.64 --> 3815.2799999999997
she understood

3811.5 --> 3819.2
yo I'm 42 yeah I'm almost 43 in a week

3815.28 --> 3819.2000000000003
I'll be 43 Jared

3822.42 --> 3827.819
it's the 98 degree that's right just

3825.059 --> 3829.92
like Nathan Oakley

3827.819 --> 3832.04
I'm a little older than Asian Oakley I

3829.92 --> 3832.04
think

3841.619 --> 3844.46
foreign

3847.2 --> 3852.96
so if I want a woman they not just have

3851.22 --> 3854.9399999999996
to be smart enough just to be able to

3852.96 --> 3857.2400000000002
follow me they have to be able to match

3854.94 --> 3857.2400000000002
me

3859.7 --> 3865.6189999999997
[Music]

3862.319 --> 3868.5589999999997
or close to match me I mean I like to be

3865.619 --> 3872.52
a little better to be fair yeah I mean

3868.559 --> 3875.2200000000003
it is my big thing in a way because yeah

3872.52 --> 3877.68
when it comes to societal integration or

3875.22 --> 3879.18
wealth it's not like oh that's great man

3877.68 --> 3882.0
I'm so good at that

3879.18 --> 3884.16
so I like to be a little better really

3882.0 --> 3887.22
can be very depressing if somebody is

3884.16 --> 3889.799
like palpably smarter

3887.22 --> 3892.3799999999997
but

3889.799 --> 3895.2599999999998
it doesn't happen a lot and even when

3892.38 --> 3898.5
that happens I kind of let that rub off

3895.26 --> 3901.0200000000004
on me so that I just get even better or

3898.5 --> 3903.24
something I'm always working on myself

3901.02 --> 3905.72
so good luck with somebody trying to

3903.24 --> 3905.72
match that

3910.2 --> 3915.98
10 years older than you all right

3912.42 --> 3915.98
bladder stage that could be

3917.22 --> 3922.4599999999996
would allow my wife to work after the

3919.799 --> 3922.46
children are born

3923.22 --> 3925.819
well

3930.119 --> 3935.1600000000003
that depends

3933.059 --> 3938.2200000000003
I mean what is going to be the setup is

3935.16 --> 3941.16
she gonna be the breadwinner

3938.22 --> 3943.3799999999997
or am I somehow gonna do that that's

3941.16 --> 3946.5
gonna be tough

3943.38 --> 3948.7400000000002
I mean unless my world turns around but

3946.5 --> 3948.74
I

3950.7 --> 3953.66
I mean how

3960.359 --> 3966.299
I wasn't Joker to be honest yeah that's

3962.22 --> 3968.3999999999996
fine that's good I like that letter Sage

3966.299 --> 3970.859
everybody says that and I like it

3968.4 --> 3973.64
they've been saying that since I was in

3970.859 --> 3973.64
my 20s so

3976.02 --> 3981.9
I still remember that when I was 21 I

3978.42 --> 3984.96
went to this party sort of thing without

3981.9 --> 3987.599
alcohol party and I had to show

3984.96 --> 3990.059
my driver's license to the guy to prove

3987.599 --> 3992.2200000000003
that I was older than 14.

3990.059 --> 3994.02
that was when I was 21 so yeah that's

3992.22 --> 3997.0389999999998
like

3994.02 --> 3997.0389999999998
it's all good man

4005.0 --> 4008.0
foreign

4008.36 --> 4011.559
[Music]

4019.299 --> 4022.5389999999998
yeah it does

4024.02 --> 4028.339
it but it's certain Indonesian Blood by

4026.48 --> 4030.619
the way it's not all I think

4028.339 --> 4033.5589999999997
but yeah my dad definitely got that

4030.619 --> 4036.079
magic Gene

4033.559 --> 4037.8190000000004
he looks great for his age man he's in

4036.079 --> 4040.46
his 70s and

4037.819 --> 4042.2
I mean he still mostly has black hair

4040.46 --> 4044.42
and all that

4042.2 --> 4047.799
that's that's pretty remarkable by

4044.42 --> 4047.799
itself at that age

4048.559 --> 4054.7400000000002
right and he's just still pretty vital I

4051.619 --> 4058.2200000000003
mean he is actually doing really well

4054.74 --> 4061.4599999999996
I'd say that right now he's doing better

4058.22 --> 4064.359
than he was 30 years ago

4061.46 --> 4064.359
a lot better

4066.16 --> 4072.6189999999997
because he's just his spirit is much

4069.44 --> 4074.2400000000002
more integrated now with his life and

4072.619 --> 4076.4
his Consciousness is better and he's

4074.24 --> 4078.68
less ballasted with her

4076.4 --> 4080.96
bad things he knows more about the world

4078.68 --> 4083.5989999999997
than he did 30 years ago a lot more so

4080.96 --> 4086.059
and he's like really enjoying life and

4083.599 --> 4088.2200000000003
doing things like actually not just

4086.059 --> 4090.079
being oh I'm okay I'm doing okay but

4088.22 --> 4093.859
like actually really enjoying life

4090.079 --> 4095.42
getting energy out of it so my dad you I

4093.859 --> 4096.5599999999995
could say that my dad's doing better

4095.42 --> 4100.279
than me

4096.56 --> 4102.38
and he's freaking 70.

4100.279 --> 4105.080000000001
they're in the 70s something

4102.38 --> 4106.1
I don't remember exactly it the 70 I

4105.08 --> 4108.259
think anyway

4106.1 --> 4110.9800000000005
so

4108.259 --> 4110.98
yeah

4121.1 --> 4124.719
no hair at all all right

4128.6 --> 4134.54
yeah my my dad has a little bit of like

4131.42 --> 4138.319
the confused Professor type hair but not

4134.54 --> 4141.98
like Einstein style or anything

4138.319 --> 4145.580000000001
but he's like yeah I don't know

4141.98 --> 4148.16
he just looks like my dad looks now

4145.58 --> 4150.14
but still it's not like oh it barely has

4148.16 --> 4153.739
any hairs left no no he has plenty of

4150.14 --> 4155.719
hairs left right and that's also like oh

4153.739 --> 4158.0599999999995
Harmony you're getting bald yeah yeah

4155.719 --> 4161.179
yeah just like

4158.06 --> 4163.279
20 years ago almost looked exactly the

4161.179 --> 4164.96
same I mean yeah it's some hairs that

4163.279 --> 4168.56
drop but

4164.96 --> 4171.199
and in 30 years I'm still gonna mostly

4168.56 --> 4172.759
look like this it's not like it's all

4171.199 --> 4174.8589999999995
going away and

4172.759 --> 4178.04
just a couple of hairs left that's just

4174.859 --> 4181.299
not going to happen to me just like it

4210.199 --> 4215.12
yeah well I never had that luxury to

4212.48 --> 4218.0599999999995
begin with because dude I only grew a

4215.12 --> 4221.0599999999995
mustache just a couple of years ago

4218.06 --> 4223.76
inspired by Owen Benjamin

4221.06 --> 4227.360000000001
but I've always had a clean shaved face

4223.76 --> 4229.820000000001
all my life before that

4227.36 --> 4231.62
and I I just can't grow but it just

4229.82 --> 4234.32
doesn't work it'll just make me look

4231.62 --> 4237.159
like a goofy hobo or something

4234.32 --> 4237.159
weirdo

4237.199 --> 4243.099999999999
so

4239.9 --> 4243.099999999999
it just doesn't work

4248.54 --> 4253.64
and I that's by the way because of my

4250.64 --> 4256.46
mom's jeans my brother has that also it

4253.64 --> 4259.52
doesn't he had a little bit of a beer

4256.46 --> 4263.9
but it's just like a little thing

4259.52 --> 4267.860000000001
so like my mother's like Elven genetics

4263.9 --> 4270.08
we don't really grow facial hair my dad

4267.86 --> 4273.4
my dad can

4270.08 --> 4273.4
he has in the past

4277.34 --> 4281.84
I mean he has had like a beard it just

4279.56 --> 4285.7390000000005
kind of looks a bit weird on him

4281.84 --> 4290.5
but I I do not I am not really capable

4285.739 --> 4290.5
of that I don't know why but yeah

4295.04 --> 4299.84
due to reduced size of chat emoticons

4298.219 --> 4302.9800000000005

Jehovah genetic yes that's what I call

4310.52 --> 4314.360000000001
it

4311.54 --> 4315.5
it's arguably also geogenetics or

4314.36 --> 4318.82
something

4315.5 --> 4318.82
I don't know what it is

4322.48 --> 4326.86
not you genetics I would be much

4327.14 --> 4331.1

4329.36 --> 4333.5
something

4331.1 --> 4336.9800000000005
magical

4333.5 --> 4339.219
my mother was like really with music in

4336.98 --> 4339.218999999999
that

4341.84 --> 4348.08
but like she's from a a breed that has

4345.32 --> 4351.04
just a super strong dreaming and

4348.08 --> 4351.04
Imagination system

4351.86 --> 4357.88
and like

4353.96 --> 4357.88
creative longings and all that

4367.82 --> 4372.98
but yeah I know very very little about

4371.0 --> 4375.5
my grandfather except that he was a

4372.98 --> 4377.78
Freemason that he basically left my

4375.5 --> 4380.9
grandmother when my mother was very

4377.78 --> 4383.54
young and that [ __ ] her up

4380.9 --> 4385.4
but I didn't I didn't even know what he

4383.54 --> 4387.38
looked like when he was younger and I

4385.4 --> 4391.36
don't know what he who he was at all

4387.38 --> 4391.36
have no photographs of him

4392.84 --> 4397.06
I have no idea what his face looked like

4398.9 --> 4401.719
because I could probably tell a lot from

4400.76 --> 4403.58
that

4401.719 --> 4405.56
but that's like yeah I'm kind of

4403.58 --> 4408.219
regretful about that I just don't know

4405.56 --> 4408.219

be fair there has been some hair loss

it's just

I'm still okay with this like it's

4492.44 --> 4499.4
pretty good I like it but yeah it's

4499.4 --> 4505.48
just rubbing my hands in my hair yeah it

4501.8 --> 4505.4800000000005

4529.48 --> 4534.139999999999
like suddenly

4531.739 --> 4537.08
lost so much hair

4534.14 --> 4539.659000000001
that he just chose to shave his head

4537.08 --> 4542.179
because it literally just like almost

4539.659 --> 4545.719
like radiation sickness just fell out

4542.179 --> 4548.6
all of a sudden up there really it was

4545.719 --> 4550.34
pretty brutal on the guy but he yeah of

4548.6 --> 4552.08
course he adapted

4550.34 --> 4554.06
still very young

4552.08 --> 4557.0599999999995
and

4554.06 --> 4558.7390000000005
yeah I mean he didn't get regret full

4557.06 --> 4561.4400000000005
over it already but yeah I've seen that

4558.739 --> 4563.839999999999
happen to other guys

4561.44 --> 4566.678999999999
but with me no

4563.84 --> 4566.679
that never happened

4576.08 --> 4580.159
you had long hair and then you could why

4578.54 --> 4582.5
did you do that then

4580.159 --> 4584.659
I mean your hairdo does look pretty cool

4582.5 --> 4586.76
I mean it's

4584.659 --> 4588.0199999999995
is not like you're looking terrible or

4586.76 --> 4589.88
anything but

4588.02 --> 4593.14
but why

4589.88 --> 4593.14
why did you even do that

4601.219 --> 4605.96
you saved bald once and then you realize

4603.44 --> 4608.0599999999995
it doesn't look very good

4605.96 --> 4610.94
yeah with me it wouldn't work either I

4608.06 --> 4614.4800000000005
mean I literally like have a weird

4610.94 --> 4617.78
dent in my head at some point that would

4614.48 --> 4621.5
really be visible then because like yeah

4617.78 --> 4622.759999999999
like a rock a tile dropped on my head

4621.5 --> 4625.58
from like

4622.76 --> 4630.04
two meters

4625.58 --> 4630.04
when I was like what is it 14

4633.14 --> 4639.9400000000005
so that yeah

4636.739 --> 4639.94
it wouldn't look great

4641.3 --> 4644.659000000001
involved on me and I don't want to go

4643.28 --> 4646.639999999999
there

4644.659 --> 4648.5599999999995
I'm not gonna go there I'm Gonna Keep it

4646.64 --> 4651.860000000001
like this and maybe it'll be a little

4648.56 --> 4654.38
bit patchy or whatever I don't care

4651.86 --> 4657.259999999999
I'm gonna keep my long hair even if I do

4654.38 --> 4659.719
like really go bald I don't care I don't

4657.26 --> 4662.0
care I will keep my long hair I don't

4659.719 --> 4664.04
care maybe that'll make me look like an

4662.0 --> 4668.06
aged hippie then I don't care I will

4664.04 --> 4670.64
keep it nothing is gonna make me change

4668.06 --> 4673.54
out of some kind of societal shame okay

4670.64 --> 4673.54
nothing

4677.36 --> 4681.759999999999
like Hulk Hogan yeah I guess

4687.199 --> 4691.0599999999995
I don't know what he looks like these

4688.94 --> 4691.0599999999995
days

4697.46 --> 4702.92
but yeah I've had I've kept my hair long

4701.06 --> 4706.159000000001
since

4702.92 --> 4709.64
I was 11. okay

4706.159 --> 4711.86
I'm never undoing that even at the time

4709.64 --> 4713.659000000001
it was a vow yeah it might have not made

4711.86 --> 4717.5
a lot of sense in a way

4713.659 --> 4719.679
but it was it was like a Samson thing to

4717.5 --> 4719.679
me

4722.12 --> 4727.219
and it was very much mocked for it at

4724.94 --> 4729.379999999999
the time

4727.219 --> 4731.84
it's like oh guy with long hair oh

4729.38 --> 4734.06
you're a girl and really that's her

4731.84 --> 4736.9400000000005
you're a girl you don't you want to have

4734.06 --> 4739.820000000001
long hair that sort of [ __ ]

4736.94 --> 4742.639999999999
I had to struggle to keep my long hair

4739.82 --> 4744.08
well guess what happens when you go

4742.64 --> 4745.76
through that and you succeed and you

4744.08 --> 4749.3
then have long hair and then you it

4745.76 --> 4751.52
looks amazing when you're like 18. yeah

4749.3 --> 4754.04
you're never gonna want to let that go

4751.52 --> 4757.1
and I will not let that go

4754.04 --> 4758.679
because I had to literally suffer to get

4757.1 --> 4762.02
it

4758.679 --> 4764.38
I'm not I'm not stopping I'm not gonna

4762.02 --> 4764.38
change

4765.62 --> 4768.159
ah

4776.48 --> 4782.32
the people curls yeah and my hair is not

4779.6 --> 4782.320000000001
curly at all

4782.659 --> 4785.379999999999
foreign

4786.94 --> 4792.94
teaches against long hair for men does

4790.76 --> 4792.9400000000005
it

4793.34 --> 4796.42
I don't know

4806.42 --> 4810.4
I don't give a [ __ ]

4810.56 --> 4814.360000000001
I literally don't give a [ __ ]

4814.76 --> 4820.46
thank you

4816.199 --> 4823.219
was was that Christ that said that

4820.46 --> 4826.1
it doesn't say it's just a quote of

4823.219 --> 4828.76
something being said so who actually

4826.1 --> 4828.76
said that

4831.739 --> 4835.9
let me check the full chapter

4836.659 --> 4839.799999999999
who is saying this

4841.28 --> 4844.179
it doesn't say

4845.3 --> 4851.4800000000005
of every man is Christ

4848.14 --> 4855.26
oh well that's definitely not Jesus

4851.48 --> 4858.199
Christ saying it then obviously

4855.26 --> 4860.3
right so is this some kind of paulian

4858.199 --> 4862.46
Doctrine

4860.3 --> 4865.76
because whatever it is I don't give a

4862.46 --> 4867.44
[ __ ] I will keep long hair

4865.76 --> 4870.02
and hey

4867.44 --> 4872.239
you're gonna have to like burn me at the

4870.02 --> 4875.120000000001
stake for it then I guess because I'm

4872.239 --> 4877.339999999999
not cutting my hair you get it yet I'm

4875.12 --> 4880.34
not cutting it

4877.34 --> 4880.34
foreign

4882.219 --> 4887.179
yeah yeah

4884.239 --> 4889.178999999999
well he's in I checked the full chapter

4887.179 --> 4891.9800000000005
and literally it starts out by

4889.179 --> 4894.32
referencing right so it obviously is not

4891.98 --> 4897.459999999999
Jesus that's saying that yeah

4894.32 --> 4897.46
so good luck with that

4899.42 --> 4902.4400000000005
it was Ringo

4908.06 --> 4911.3
ah

4909.32 --> 4912.62

4912.62 --> 4917.739
the show is already over can't believe

4914.9 --> 4917.739
that time has flown

4924.199 --> 4929.12
and how little I actually talked about

4926.48 --> 4931.159
media Armageddon but then again who

4929.12 --> 4933.98
wants to talk about that I mean they're

4931.159 --> 4935.36
already in your face about it you should

4933.98 --> 4937.339999999999
know that

4935.36 --> 4939.58
at this point that that's happening out

4937.34 --> 4939.58
there

4939.62 --> 4944.92
and I did actually like just the more

4942.199 --> 4944.919999999999
personal talk

4947.6 --> 4951.46
