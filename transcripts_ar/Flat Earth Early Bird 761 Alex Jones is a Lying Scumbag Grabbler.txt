70.84 --> 74.24000000000001
yeah good morning everyone i'm very late

73.68 --> 77.28
today

74.24 --> 80.64
this is it's uh past

77.28 --> 83.92
half past one but yeah

80.64 --> 87.2
i had to do some groceries and yeah

83.92 --> 89.6
it was open at one o'clock so

87.2 --> 90.64
there was no way i could be on time for

89.6 --> 93.52
everything

90.64 --> 94.96000000000001
i wanted to do it because otherwise i'm

93.52 --> 97.2
every time

94.96 --> 99.67999999999999
i have to basically do these things

97.2 --> 101.36
during the flat earth debate

99.68 --> 104.799
and i don't really like that because i

101.36 --> 107.68
do also miss good parts because of that

104.799 --> 109.60000000000001
so i just thought doing it before now

107.68 --> 111.28
when i started my show at two o'clock

109.6 --> 114.079
that was not a problem

111.28 --> 114.479
because i'd still had plenty of time

114.079 --> 116.63999999999999
well

114.479 --> 118.32
now that i'm starting my show at one

116.64 --> 121.2
it's much harder to fit

118.32 --> 124.88
going out for groceries before starting

121.2 --> 124.88000000000001
the show but i did it anyway today

125.92 --> 129.75900000000001
but yeah because of that i'm a little

127.36 --> 132.959
late so

129.759 --> 136.95899999999997
all right the weather today is

132.959 --> 140.48
yeah kind of similar to yesterday

136.959 --> 140.48
it's not wet

140.56 --> 144.879
there's plenty of clouds up there but

142.4 --> 148.0
they're not super thick

144.879 --> 150.48
from what i can see it's it's

148.0 --> 153.2
moving at least it's in the clouds seem

150.48 --> 156.72
to be moving pretty rapidly

153.2 --> 157.83999999999997
up there yeah i think the camera can

156.72 --> 161.519
even pick that up

157.84 --> 165.04
you can see it move to the left

161.519 --> 165.68
very rapidly but yeah there's no real

165.04 --> 169.04
wind

165.68 --> 171.84
down here so it's not particularly

169.04 --> 171.84
cold or anything

174.319 --> 178.879
it's just a typical winter's day in the

176.4 --> 178.87900000000002
netherlands

182.4 --> 188.31900000000002
oh man

185.519 --> 189.28
right yeah yesterday evening i ran out

188.319 --> 193.35999999999999
of my

189.28 --> 198.48
uh my tobacco that i got

193.36 --> 201.92000000000002
from across from across the atlantic

198.48 --> 204.07999999999998
so yeah also bought some regular package

201.92 --> 206.79899999999998
of that immediately getting very

204.08 --> 209.20000000000002
disgusting imagery

206.799 --> 211.04000000000002
ugh they typically do that here in a

209.2 --> 212.64
tobacco but anyway

211.04 --> 214.48
since i did make the order for the

212.64 --> 218.72
tobacco sometime back

214.48 --> 219.51899999999998
hopefully it'll arrive here somewhere in

218.72 --> 222.72
january

219.519 --> 227.84
hopefully the first week and then i can

222.72 --> 227.84
get back to good quality tobacco

230.799 --> 237.68
oh yes here we go again

233.92 --> 241.04
first hey sex sterling you you have

237.68 --> 244.0
snow ice and slush

241.04 --> 244.56
on the ground in the uk huh well we

244.0 --> 248.319
haven't

244.56 --> 250.239
seen even one snowflake over here or i

248.319 --> 251.28
haven't at least maybe further land

250.239 --> 254.48000000000002
inwards they have

251.28 --> 257.359
but over here not so

254.48 --> 257.759
this is kind of odd that there would be

257.359 --> 261.44
snow

257.759 --> 261.44
in the uk and not over here

261.519 --> 269.6
huh i guess it's a little bit colder

264.4 --> 274.71999999999997
over there

269.6 --> 274.72
all right anyway i got some extra coffee

276.16 --> 285.6
my second and

280.479 --> 288.15999999999997
green tea but it's yeah i had to make it

285.6 --> 289.52000000000004
i just made it i mean so may take a

288.16 --> 292.56
while

289.52 --> 292.56
just leaving it there

295.12 --> 311.84000000000003
what can i call you for short

298.56 --> 311.84
are you addressing me sex sterling

318.8 --> 324.56
and what can i call you for sure you

322.84 --> 338.63899999999995
can't yeah

324.56 --> 341.68
you can do that but the quickest

338.639 --> 344.0
is to just copy paste the entire name

341.68 --> 344.0
you know

348.96 --> 353.84
hey aratazala

358.319 --> 362.88
yeah good to see you all uh yeah again

360.639 --> 365.039
i'm very late today so it's only gonna

362.88 --> 368.319
be

365.039 --> 370.56
one and a half hour show at most

368.319 --> 373.28000000000003
before this the flat of debate starts

370.56 --> 373.28000000000003
sorry about that

373.44 --> 376.56
but again i had to go out for some

375.28 --> 379.75899999999996
groceries and

376.56 --> 382.479
yeah some of the stores

379.759 --> 384.8
opened after one o'clock so that was

382.479 --> 384.8
kind of

385.039 --> 390.24
tough timing and i didn't want to go

388.4 --> 395.84
during the flat earth debates because

390.24 --> 395.84000000000003
then i might miss something interesting

402.04 --> 405.189
[Music]

406.84 --> 413.11999999999995
hahaha

409.759 --> 413.12
what the why are you

415.599 --> 419.199
oh right that's a

420.479 --> 428.31899999999996
i don't think

423.68 --> 428.72
that rattazala would appreciate being

428.319 --> 437.84000000000003
called

428.72 --> 437.84000000000003
a rat

439.81 --> 442.92
[Music]

443.039 --> 446.8
you don't have to delete that it's just

448.24 --> 451.52
you know it all depends anyway like a

451.12 --> 454.319
rat

451.52 --> 456.0
is a like a european symbol for the

454.319 --> 459.12
plague or a

456.0 --> 462.4
parasite but hey in

459.12 --> 465.199
what is it in china and other cultures

462.4 --> 466.15999999999997
are red is like actually a very gentle

465.199 --> 469.28000000000003
creature and

466.16 --> 472.639
hey actual rats when when not

469.28 --> 474.63899999999995
bewildered are really gentle and social

472.639 --> 478.639
creatures

474.639 --> 483.44
with wisdom sounds weird but they are

478.639 --> 483.44
so it all depends what the angle is

490.879 --> 494.40000000000003
not original though yeah

504.8 --> 511.84000000000003
anyway uh i did plenty yesterday also

508.639 --> 511.84000000000003
went to bed pretty early

514.0 --> 518.959
it was weird i did a little experiment

516.399 --> 523.76
yesterday

518.959 --> 527.76
because i drank beer again yesterday

523.76 --> 529.92
the half strength one because

527.76 --> 531.279
i was just thinking like it's been

529.92 --> 533.4399999999999
staring me in the face

531.279 --> 534.48
i don't even know what it does or i

533.44 --> 537.839
didn't

534.48 --> 540.88
so i took that and

537.839 --> 544.8800000000001
i guess i enjoyed it but

540.88 --> 548.0
it wasn't the same it was weird because

544.88 --> 550.32
i barely felt anything from it like

548.0 --> 551.6
it's not the same as it was before i got

550.32 --> 555.6800000000001
sick

551.6 --> 555.6800000000001
so it felt like kind of a dud

556.8 --> 561.76
it's not even no because it's not oh no

559.44 --> 564.24
i'm addicted again no it was a bummer

561.76 --> 565.04
it wasn't a negative experience it just

564.24 --> 570.32
didn't do

565.04 --> 573.5999999999999
much for me that was the weird part

570.32 --> 573.6
so it's different now

574.8 --> 579.279
it didn't make that much of an impact

577.36 --> 581.279
positive or negative

579.279 --> 583.2
that was that was something i didn't

581.279 --> 585.4399999999999
expect

583.2 --> 589.0400000000001
because i did feel like oh dear i'm not

585.44 --> 592.8000000000001
going to be seduced again i hope

589.04 --> 597.1999999999999
but just in the post-christmas uh

592.8 --> 600.399
new year's eve idea i thought like

597.2 --> 601.6
let's try it let's see if it is fun and

600.399 --> 603.36
if it is

601.6 --> 604.64
then i might do it again on new year's

603.36 --> 608.88
eve or something

604.64 --> 611.92
but i might still do that it's just that

608.88 --> 612.88
it wasn't the same it wasn't

611.92 --> 616.4799999999999
particularly

612.88 --> 617.68
disgusting or dug oh my god i've missed

616.48 --> 620.9590000000001
that so much

617.68 --> 621.76
it was just like a drink and i did feel

620.959 --> 623.76
that there was

621.76 --> 626.88
alcohol in it but it just didn't do much

623.76 --> 630.399
for me now that's a big surprise

626.88 --> 632.959
because i'm used to being very

630.399 --> 634.8
sensitive to alcohol even though this

632.959 --> 636.7199999999999
was like half strength with some lemon

634.8 --> 639.3599999999999
juice in there it's the rattler

636.72 --> 639.36
type beer

640.16 --> 642.64
it just

643.519 --> 647.839
yeah it was not what i expected

648.56 --> 653.5189999999999
it didn't make much of an impact so it's

650.8 --> 653.519
like okay

655.279 --> 658.079
well that was that

658.399 --> 662.399
i barely even feel it this morning

667.76 --> 672.3199999999999
i stopped drinking coffee too i don't

669.92 --> 676.88
know why i just did

672.32 --> 676.88
and i love the taste right

677.12 --> 682.399
well coffee can you look every type of

680.64 --> 684.72
these drinks always has some kind of

682.399 --> 688.64
burden on your system

684.72 --> 693.2
right and coffee uh

688.64 --> 694.959
yeah is def is very burdensome is

693.2 --> 698.0
like especially if you take a lot

694.959 --> 702.7199999999999
because it kind of like forces

698.0 --> 706.0
the nutrients and especially the

702.72 --> 708.48
vitamins from your body it forces it out

706.0 --> 709.36
of it like squeezes you for your healthy

708.48 --> 711.6800000000001
substance

709.36 --> 713.44
squeezes it into your blood you enjoy

711.68 --> 716.7199999999999
that temporarily

713.44 --> 720.0790000000001
but yeah it it drains you

716.72 --> 722.88
that's effectively what it does

720.079 --> 723.5999999999999
it's not great for your system coffee

722.88 --> 726.8
when you stop

723.6 --> 728.839
it or lessen it dramatically

726.8 --> 731.8389999999999
it's a lot better for your entire

728.839 --> 731.839
metabolism

733.92 --> 744.399
right and alcohol yeah does something

737.36 --> 746.639
entirely different

744.399 --> 747.76
but it also changes your metabolism

746.639 --> 750.639
because it has a

747.76 --> 753.68
pretty short-term dramatic influence on

750.639 --> 756.32
your guts and all that and just how you

753.68 --> 756.7199999999999
assimilate food when you have it in you

756.32 --> 762.24
it's

756.72 --> 762.24
it's weird how about different

765.92 --> 769.12
i've cut way down on coffee but not

768.0 --> 771.2
alcohol yet

769.12 --> 773.12
that's tough one look cutting down on

771.2 --> 775.839
elko is much tougher even

773.12 --> 777.68
although yeah coffee can be pretty damn

775.839 --> 780.48
addictive

777.68 --> 782.16
especially once you let yourself go and

780.48 --> 784.5600000000001
constantly drink it

782.16 --> 785.4399999999999
once you allow yourself to do that then

784.56 --> 788.8
you can become

785.44 --> 788.8000000000001
pretty severely addicted

788.959 --> 792.399
like with palpable addiction symptoms

791.2 --> 795.6800000000001
and all that

792.399 --> 795.68
and side effects

795.839 --> 801.0400000000001
with alcohol once you get really

797.519 --> 804.32
addicted it just becomes

801.04 --> 807.68
much tougher because it

804.32 --> 809.9200000000001
impacts your mood throughout the day

807.68 --> 810.8
dramatically when you're addicted to it

809.92 --> 814.399
and has

810.8 --> 817.3599999999999
like a direct impact on your organs

814.399 --> 819.12
so yeah it's not it isn't classified a

817.36 --> 821.76
hard drug for nothing

819.12 --> 822.5600000000001
so you got to be careful with that it's

821.76 --> 825.199
always about

822.56 --> 826.079
not letting it slip into the deep

825.199 --> 828.4799999999999
alcohol like

826.079 --> 829.68
don't allow yourself to do that you know

828.48 --> 831.44
it's fine

829.68 --> 832.7199999999999
if you want to be able to drink a beer

831.44 --> 836.0
here and then

832.72 --> 838.639
and there but don't let it slip

836.0 --> 840.48
don't allow yourself to be like i can

838.639 --> 843.76
take one more

840.48 --> 844.88
like never allow that in never allow

843.76 --> 847.36
that sort of slipping

844.88 --> 848.399
because it's just so dangerous once you

847.36 --> 850.88
start allow

848.399 --> 851.76
indulging it's basically once you start

850.88 --> 853.68
indulging that

851.76 --> 855.6
because once you get really addicted to

853.68 --> 858.8
alcohol not everybody would

855.6 --> 861.36
some will it's really

858.8 --> 861.92
big trouble getting out of it again it's

861.36 --> 863.6
much

861.92 --> 865.199
more difficult to get out of it than

863.6 --> 869.279
most things

865.199 --> 871.519
and yeah that's some people

869.279 --> 873.76
bro in chat also will be familiar with

871.519 --> 873.76
that

876.639 --> 883.36
what you drink coffee three quarters

879.76 --> 887.12
times a day uh

883.36 --> 889.1990000000001
okay well i drink

887.12 --> 891.44
basically standard one coffee and

889.199 --> 895.199
sometimes two when i feel like it

891.44 --> 895.1990000000001
but definitely not every day too

895.519 --> 901.199
once i do it i have to like not do it

897.68 --> 901.199
for a while and then it'll be alright

901.279 --> 905.4399999999999
oh three two four okay that's

905.92 --> 911.92
that's a lot for me no

917.44 --> 924.48
insert in my comment section

920.88 --> 926.56
you write way too much don't expect me

924.48 --> 927.9200000000001
to constantly follow what you're putting

926.56 --> 931.04
in there

927.92 --> 933.279
i i got a life

931.04 --> 936.88

serious

945.29 --> 949.24
[Music]

950.48 --> 954.0
mark swiller is a guy that's been

952.399 --> 956.399
following me for quite

954.0 --> 957.839
a while and he just has this habit kind

956.399 --> 961.36
of bad habit of

957.839 --> 963.2790000000001
inserting giant slabs of text that are

961.36 --> 965.36
sometimes interesting but he just does

963.279 --> 967.36
it too much he does it multiple times a

965.36 --> 970.5600000000001
day every day

967.36 --> 973.36
when he feels like it and then he yeah

970.56 --> 974.079
expects me to read that all like oh yeah

973.36 --> 977.04
yeah

974.079 --> 979.68
oh i have to read my two three four

977.04 --> 982.88
pages of mark smiler for the day

979.68 --> 987.8389999999999
no no i don't

982.88 --> 987.8389999999999
don't expect me to do that please

992.8 --> 996.0
i mean i appreciate that you care enough

995.12 --> 998.48
to comment but

996.0 --> 1001.04
don't expect me to read that every time

998.48 --> 1002.16
and bring out a report of your comment

1001.04 --> 1004.24
please

1002.16 --> 1006.24
i'm not gonna do that if you if you

1004.24 --> 1010.399
really think it's that important

1006.24 --> 1013.759
make your own videos

1010.399 --> 1016.639
right and then instead of

1013.759 --> 1018.399
like posting several slabs of text you

1016.639 --> 1020.72
can just post a link

1018.399 --> 1021.519
to the video you made where you discuss

1020.72 --> 1023.44
it

1021.519 --> 1024.559
so that you can say look i have some

1023.44 --> 1028.16
things to say

1024.559 --> 1030.8799999999999
here is the video one link

1028.16 --> 1031.8390000000002
done no like oh here's another slab of

1030.88 --> 1034.959
text that i

1031.839 --> 1036.079
am probably supposed to read no just a

1034.959 --> 1038.799
link to a video

1036.079 --> 1040.3999999999999
where you do whatever you need to do and

1038.799 --> 1043.199
then people can watch it

1040.4 --> 1044.959
and then they can comment slabs of text

1043.199 --> 1046.559
and tell you that you're supposed to

1044.959 --> 1053.8400000000001
read it okay

1046.559 --> 1053.84
how about that

1055.44 --> 1060.48
yeah whatever marks on my layer i don't

1057.44 --> 1060.48
believe a word you're saying

1063.84 --> 1069.9189999999999
nobody's like shutting down

1067.12 --> 1071.76
internet timed wise because you did

1069.919 --> 1072.48
something that somebody somewhere didn't

1071.76 --> 1075.52
like

1072.48 --> 1081.84
that's absolute nonsense

1075.52 --> 1081.84
really it is

1084.24 --> 1087.679
on the other hand sometimes

1087.76 --> 1092.0
when you might comment and you might use

1089.76 --> 1096.08
certain words

1092.0 --> 1098.799
bad words that could be universally

1096.08 --> 1100.96
considered bad then youtube now just

1098.799 --> 1102.08
deletes it it just doesn't allow you to

1100.96 --> 1103.8400000000001
comment with that

1102.08 --> 1105.6
does it has nothing to do with any

1103.84 --> 1108.3999999999999
banned word lists

1105.6 --> 1109.9189999999999
of a channel owner it's just youtube

1108.4 --> 1112.0800000000002
does it i've noticed that

1109.919 --> 1114.24
they just don't allow certain words

1112.08 --> 1116.3999999999999
anymore they just erase

1114.24 --> 1116.4
it

1117.36 --> 1123.84
no i'm not good with the bow and arrow i

1119.919 --> 1123.8400000000001
might be i haven't tried in over

1124.08 --> 1126.96
a long time

1127.679 --> 1134.64
i don't care i am not a

1130.96 --> 1138.48
bow shooter i have a bow and arrows

1134.64 --> 1139.039
i can use it if i needed to or if i want

1138.48 --> 1142.559
to

1139.039 --> 1144.16
it's not my hobby it's a prop it just

1142.559 --> 1146.8799999999999
hangs there

1144.16 --> 1147.679
right because i'm an elf an elf needs a

1146.88 --> 1151.2
bow

1147.679 --> 1151.52
or they're defenseless right and that's

1151.2 --> 1155.919
it

1151.52 --> 1158.559
that is it no more questions

1155.919 --> 1160.96
please or i'm going to put the word bow

1158.559 --> 1162.799
and crossbow on the banned list because

1160.96 --> 1179.8400000000001
i'm sick of these questions

1162.799 --> 1179.84
how many damn times have to answer this

1182.48 --> 1185.679
mark smiler people have been messing

1185.28 --> 1188.96
with

1185.679 --> 1192.16
internet in a complicated fashion for

1188.96 --> 1195.3600000000001
over a decade

1192.16 --> 1198.559
but the way you describe it is

1195.36 --> 1199.76
is not logical and not consistent that's

1198.559 --> 1203.559
not what happens

1199.76 --> 1205.2
at all not even close so you're over

1203.559 --> 1208.1589999999999
dramatizing

1205.2 --> 1208.159
the censorship

1208.72 --> 1213.6000000000001
there's another word for that it's

1211.36 --> 1215.6
called squirting

1213.6 --> 1217.9189999999999
making things worse than it is and then

1215.6 --> 1221.84
just reveling in the doom

1217.919 --> 1221.8400000000001
no thanks

1224.799 --> 1235.84
huh i was watching conspiracy music girl

1229.28 --> 1235.84
all right cool

1246.48 --> 1249.76
right ah did i mix i did make some notes

1249.12 --> 1252.3999999999999
huh

1249.76 --> 1254.24
i made notes i skipped it for like three

1252.4 --> 1262.0
days but i at least started up

1254.24 --> 1264.48
making notes again

1262.0 --> 1266.4
yeah yesterday we flooded the baits was

1264.48 --> 1268.799
good

1266.4 --> 1268.799
uh

1269.84 --> 1275.84
this it was it wasn't bad

1273.2 --> 1278.72
it was just a bit quiet i don't know why

1275.84 --> 1281.039
quite for monday

1278.72 --> 1283.28
and own benjamin was also live i caught

1281.039 --> 1283.28
them

1283.44 --> 1288.3200000000002
just it was good

1285.37 --> 1291.6
[Music]

1288.32 --> 1294.48
and i made a note just like

1291.6 --> 1296.799
it was just general general wisdom time

1294.48 --> 1296.799
again

1302.96 --> 1307.8400000000001
all right and i just had this universal

1306.159 --> 1311.8400000000001
thing that i made a note of

1307.84 --> 1314.6399999999999
that is only when you truly understand

1311.84 --> 1319.84
will your required actions become

1314.64 --> 1319.8400000000001
apparent and without doubt

1321.039 --> 1327.36
and that's like universally true

1324.32 --> 1330.48
if you really think about it and like

1327.36 --> 1333.039
the fractal of yeah what's out there and

1330.48 --> 1336.0
everything in every person

1333.039 --> 1336.96
that's how it works because if you don't

1336.0 --> 1338.96
understand

1336.96 --> 1340.08
then you don't know what you're doing

1338.96 --> 1343.039
even if you are

1340.08 --> 1345.6789999999999
siding with it for whatever reason it's

1343.039 --> 1349.039
only when you truly understand

1345.679 --> 1352.48
that fears and uncertainties

1349.039 --> 1352.48
basically drop away

1353.2 --> 1358.0
and you just do what you know must be

1355.76 --> 1358.0
done

1358.08 --> 1362.08
because that is what understanding

1359.6 --> 1365.9189999999999
brings once you truly understand you

1362.08 --> 1365.9189999999999
also figure out that

1366.559 --> 1370.1589999999999
yeah just what must be done and that

1368.559 --> 1373.12
alternatives are

1370.159 --> 1375.2800000000002
no longer viable because yeah there is

1373.12 --> 1376.799
no more uncertainty of the best course

1375.28 --> 1379.2
of action

1376.799 --> 1389.84
right so that yeah just make that made

1379.2 --> 1389.8400000000001
that little note

1392.0 --> 1400.0
i need to learn the bow

1395.84 --> 1400.0
i don't know why that got

1400.96 --> 1405.28
what why did that

1405.919 --> 1409.2
i did not delete that

1410.08 --> 1415.52
maybe the word mad mad

1413.36 --> 1416.7199999999998
is no longer allowed or something

1415.52 --> 1418.8799999999999
because i don't see

1416.72 --> 1419.84
why youtube had to hold back that

1418.88 --> 1424.159
sentence

1419.84 --> 1424.1589999999999
that i can't even approve it's

1428.84 --> 1431.84
ridiculous

1437.12 --> 1442.08
yeah but i don't technically need to do

1439.76 --> 1445.76
anything

1442.08 --> 1448.24
like that like i'll do these things

1445.76 --> 1449.039
i'll do things in general when i can

1448.24 --> 1451.2
move on

1449.039 --> 1453.039
i'm not going to just go out there and

1451.2 --> 1454.96
do stuff

1453.039 --> 1457.2
like that like oh i'm going to both

1454.96 --> 1460.64
shoot because people are telling me

1457.2 --> 1461.52
i should be doing that no i'm not doing

1460.64 --> 1463.919
[ __ ]

1461.52 --> 1464.8799999999999
because i don't want to doesn't matter

1463.919 --> 1467.039
if a hundred

1464.88 --> 1468.88
thousand people tell me every freaking

1467.039 --> 1472.72
day you gotta do bo you

1468.88 --> 1476.72
no i'm not gonna do it

1472.72 --> 1480.72
i don't care i don't wanna do that

1476.72 --> 1480.72
and i'll do it when i wanna do it

1485.36 --> 1489.1999999999998
youtube staff are sitting at their pcs

1488.559 --> 1492.1589999999999
laughing

1489.2 --> 1494.64
really why it's fully automated they

1492.159 --> 1497.279
don't even know it's happening

1494.64 --> 1498.72
it's just some new algorithm decision

1497.279 --> 1501.2
that they've done

1498.72 --> 1501.919
i don't think youtube staff is laughing

1501.2 --> 1505.44
about it

1501.919 --> 1505.44
because they don't know what it even

1512.84 --> 1516.24
does

1514.96 --> 1518.88
[Music]

1516.24 --> 1522.64
oh that you did that he was calling you

1518.88 --> 1525.6000000000001
an elf oh my god how dare you

1522.64 --> 1527.44
how dare you call me an elf since i have

1525.6 --> 1532.7199999999998
an elven name

1527.44 --> 1536.96
and i pride myself to be an elf

1532.72 --> 1540.88
so yeah oh oh wait because other people

1536.96 --> 1541.3600000000001
are called an elf and a wizard in a bad

1540.88 --> 1543.3600000000001
way

1541.36 --> 1544.4799999999998
that means that i can no longer be

1543.36 --> 1547.84
called an elf an

1544.48 --> 1548.96
or a wizard because it is being

1547.84 --> 1552.24
popularized

1548.96 --> 1555.3600000000001
out there to call that evil and crazy

2425.76 --> 2433.2000000000003
he's like the bob he is like a bob

2429.119 --> 2435.2000000000003
in infowars it's exactly the same setup

2433.2 --> 2438.319
everybody just does what he freaking

2435.2 --> 2441.68
says because he's out of control

2438.319 --> 2444.079
like socially

2441.68 --> 2446.0
whenever he says or feels or wants

2444.079 --> 2448.079
something or has some intuition he just

2446.0 --> 2450.079
does it no matter the cost

2448.079 --> 2451.119
because he's an impulsive [ __ ]

2450.079 --> 2453.6800000000003
grabbler

2451.119 --> 2456.8
and he can't help himself including can

2453.68 --> 2467.839
help himself destroy his own work

2456.8 --> 2467.8390000000004
because he's a [ __ ] graveler

2468.16 --> 2473.68
right so yeah had that coming for a long

2471.92 --> 2476.88
time

2473.68 --> 2476.8799999999997
a long long time

2479.68 --> 2484.3999999999996
just but like the recent advertisement

2482.8 --> 2486.8
is just that was just the

2484.4 --> 2488.1600000000003
drop that made the bucket spill the

2486.8 --> 2491.599
stupid oh it's a

2488.16 --> 2494.8799999999997
fact it's a scientifically proven fact

2491.599 --> 2497.28
like gravity and water boiling

2494.88 --> 2498.4
and that he said and water boiling that

2497.28 --> 2501.92
means that he

2498.4 --> 2505.119
knows he's lying he

2501.92 --> 2507.04
knows it's a lie he knows

2505.119 --> 2508.48

2507.04 --> 2511.52
water boiling he

2508.48 --> 2514.96
knows he's a liar alex jones

2569.599 --> 2572.6400000000003
so i'm just going to call this after

2571.44 --> 2576.96

have to take

2607.119 --> 2610.96
everything back everything he done and

2609.28 --> 2614.1600000000003

2610.96 --> 2615.52
[ __ ] event where he's just oh i'm

2614.16 --> 2617.5989999999997
going to make a point

2615.52 --> 2618.64
so i'm going to make up excuses for

2617.599 --> 2620.7200000000003
everything

2618.64 --> 2622.4
and then in the last minute pretend like

2620.72 --> 2622.9599999999996
nothing happened and do it all over

2622.4 --> 2625.92
again

2622.96 --> 2626.319
like a scumbag grabbler like what he

2625.92 --> 2629.359

2673.68 --> 2679.839
basically sharing my disdain over what

2677.119 --> 2682.96
he has done to himself

2679.839 --> 2684.88
because i used to love that guy i he was

2682.96 --> 2687.76
my big brother my big

2684.88 --> 2688.96
my awesome uncle that taught me things

2687.76 --> 2690.88
that were scary

2688.96 --> 2692.64
that i thought i needed to know and he

2690.88 --> 2695.359
turned the first he turned

2692.64 --> 2697.5989999999997
gay and then he just turned like into a

2695.359 --> 2701.2799999999997
lying scumbag

2697.599 --> 2705.839
so bad so bad

2701.28 --> 2705.8390000000004
it's unacceptable

2706.56 --> 2713.2
like at this point like it sounds really

2710.24 --> 2715.04
bad at this point if government

2713.2 --> 2716.48
left this government of abiding

2715.04 --> 2719.92
government whatever

2716.48 --> 2722.4
if he got shut down like yes you're now

2719.92 --> 2723.44
shut down you're no longer allowed to

2722.4 --> 2726.48
operate

2723.44 --> 2729.76
i'm not even gonna speak out about it

2726.48 --> 2730.48
because he got that bad i don't care

2729.76 --> 2733.3590000000004
anymore

2730.48 --> 2734.48
i don't care if everything he does

2733.359 --> 2737.839
everything he did

2734.48 --> 2741.28
just gets shut down and deleted because

2737.839 --> 2745.2799999999997
he made it happen by becoming a

2741.28 --> 2748.5600000000004
scumbag lying grabbler

2745.28 --> 2752.0
with no shame and no loyalty

2748.56 --> 2755.68
but to anything but his own freaking

2752.0 --> 2758.4
secret little agendas in his head is

2755.68 --> 2758.8799999999997
whatever the [ __ ] is left of that even

2758.4 --> 2762.96
just a

2758.88 --> 2763.76
short-term gain because oh i don't do it

2762.96 --> 2767.04
for the money

2763.76 --> 2769.599
oh i don't do whatever the [ __ ] like

2767.04 --> 2772.319
everything he says is now a lie just

2769.599 --> 2775.839
lies about everything

2772.319 --> 2778.24
i'm sick of it it's become so convoluted

2775.839 --> 2779.92
like he doesn't even know anymore about

2778.24 --> 2780.3999999999996
what he's lying and isn't but you can

2779.92 --> 2783.119
just

2780.4 --> 2785.76
figure it out that he is he just doesn't

2783.119 --> 2788.319
even know it anymore

2785.76 --> 2789.0400000000004
because he's just allowed himself to

2788.319 --> 2791.68
become a

2789.04 --> 2792.16
full-on liar and when you do that you

2791.68 --> 2795.9199999999996
lose

2792.16 --> 2795.92
track you lose track

2796.48 --> 2803.04
and he has lost track lost track

2799.92 --> 2805.52
of his schemes of his own

2803.04 --> 2808.16
secret little manipulations he lost

2805.52 --> 2811.7599999999998
track and he's just an overt liar now

2808.16 --> 2814.3999999999996
about so much he cannot even speak about

2811.76 --> 2817.599
anything anymore without manipulating it

2814.4 --> 2819.359
in some way he can't even do it anymore

2817.599 --> 2823.119
he's he's getting to the point where

2819.359 --> 2826.88
he's becoming a pathological liar

2823.119 --> 2830.319
hillary clinton style pathological liar

2826.88 --> 2831.6800000000003
yeah i said it yeah

2830.319 --> 2834.56
that's what he's becoming it's

2831.68 --> 2834.56
disgusting

2838.96 --> 2843.68
no i am saying it i'm saying it because

2842.319 --> 2845.839
i care

2843.68 --> 2847.52
because i used to respect him that's why

2845.839 --> 2850.64
i'm saying it

2847.52 --> 2852.64
this is not some order of some leftist

2850.64 --> 2855.2
thing or whatever it's like oh yeah it's

2852.64 --> 2856.48
popular to attack alex jones so that's

2855.2 --> 2858.96
why i'm doing that

2856.48 --> 2859.76
i don't give a [ __ ] i never talk about

2858.96 --> 2862.48
him

2859.76 --> 2863.6800000000003
i feel like talking about it now because

2862.48 --> 2866.96
i have

2863.68 --> 2870.0789999999997
at occasion checked into infowars

2866.96 --> 2873.359
and every single time i do it i

2870.079 --> 2876.7200000000003
bump into this [ __ ] i can't even

2873.359 --> 2877.52
just look 15 minutes without bumping

2876.72 --> 2880.64
into

2877.52 --> 2884.64
brutal lies

2880.64 --> 2886.72
and addiction manipulation every step of

2884.64 --> 2892.319
the way i'm so

2886.72 --> 2892.319
sick of it so repulsed

2894.0 --> 2898.96
it's unacceptable and i'm going to speak

2897.44 --> 2902.7200000000003
out about it

2898.96 --> 2907.34
and i have i have done it in this show

2902.72 --> 2910.5099999999998
and i'm not taking it back i'm done with

2907.34 --> 2910.51
[Music]

2912.839 --> 2915.839
him

2921.53 --> 2924.6690000000003
[Music]

2930.0 --> 2934.72
flat earth shoes reveal them the flatter

2932.72 --> 2937.7599999999998
shells have already revealed themselves

2934.72 --> 2939.68
awake souls you're one of them

2937.76 --> 2940.88
you are one of them because the only

2939.68 --> 2943.7599999999998
thing you do is

2940.88 --> 2944.48
just assume everybody's a shill and

2943.76 --> 2947.599
you're just

2944.48 --> 2950.16
waiting until reality proves it

2947.599 --> 2951.52
in your twisted little view of the world

2950.16 --> 2955.44
right

2951.52 --> 2957.839
yeah we know you've already revealed

2955.44 --> 2957.839
yourself

2958.0 --> 2963.52
because you don't even know anymore what

2961.44 --> 2965.44
the difference is between a shield and a

2963.52 --> 2967.119
non-shield you don't even know anymore

2965.44 --> 2968.079
you don't even know about the arguments

2967.119 --> 2969.839
anymore

2968.079 --> 2971.8390000000004
because you lost track because the only

2969.839 --> 2974.0
thing you can focus on is that

2971.839 --> 2977.44
everybody's a chill i'm just going to

2974.0 --> 2977.44
wait until it's all revealed

2982.0 --> 2985.839
you would never see a bad thing about

2983.839 --> 2990.0
israel that's not true

2985.839 --> 2990.0
that that part is not true

2990.96 --> 2996.319
that's not true he did he actually said

2994.079 --> 2998.7200000000003
the what is it again the the big bomb

2996.319 --> 3001.599
that went off

2998.72 --> 3001.5989999999997
where was it again

3002.24 --> 3008.4799999999996
this year he actually said that that

3005.44 --> 3012.319
is he said that was a

3008.48 --> 3015.92
mossad secret operation okay

3012.319 --> 3019.359
so no he does have

3015.92 --> 3020.96
criticism on israel it's just he doesn't

3019.359 --> 3023.359
like to focus on it

3020.96 --> 3024.7200000000003
because beirut that's the one right

3023.359 --> 3029.359
because

3024.72 --> 3031.7599999999998
he believes in the merger

3029.359 --> 3033.92
he believes it's necessary he believe

3031.76 --> 3037.76
it's a necessary alliance

3033.92 --> 3040.079
right that's his conviction

3037.76 --> 3041.119
and he's freaking tied into the israeli

3040.079 --> 3043.119
agenda because

3041.119 --> 3045.76
his wife is israeli blah blah blah all

3043.119 --> 3045.76
that right

3046.24 --> 3052.839
so but he does actually have

3049.44 --> 3056.0
criticism on israel so it's just

3052.839 --> 3058.7999999999997
wrong doesn't matter though

3056.0 --> 3059.76
because it doesn't matter who he's

3058.8 --> 3062.48
defending

3059.76 --> 3064.3190000000004
or holding back on politically it's

3062.48 --> 3068.48
completely irrelevant

3064.319 --> 3070.64
to the generalized level of grabblering

3068.48 --> 3073.119
the grappling he does on his own

3070.64 --> 3076.72
freaking audience the manipulation which

3073.119 --> 3077.92
goes beyond sensibility or long-term

3076.72 --> 3080.3999999999996
building

3077.92 --> 3081.28
he's just parasiting on his own audience

3080.4 --> 3083.44
now

3081.28 --> 3086.3190000000004
that is the problem not that he's

3083.44 --> 3089.04
supposedly some agent for some

3086.319 --> 3092.24
political faction he isn't he's just a

3089.04 --> 3092.24
freaking grappler now

3092.48 --> 3097.839
yes zack sterling i know i know

3107.28 --> 3110.8
took me so long to get to my sense well

3109.119 --> 3112.2400000000002
i've mentioned it before i just didn't

3110.8 --> 3115.599
want to go

3112.24 --> 3118.64
do that i just didn't feel like that

3115.599 --> 3119.599
i don't like attacking somebody that i

3118.64 --> 3125.839
used to love

3119.599 --> 3125.839
in the past i hate it feels bad

3132.24 --> 3136.64
yeah you keep on making your sock

3134.24 --> 3138.64
accounts because it's so important

3136.64 --> 3139.7599999999998
that you squirt in other people's chat

3138.64 --> 3142.7999999999997
and tell them oh

3139.76 --> 3143.8390000000004
you're just a failure and i'm not a

3142.8 --> 3147.04
failure at all

3143.839 --> 3150.0
despite every freaking normal person

3147.04 --> 3150.88
that's worth anything hates you right

3150.0 --> 3154.559
awake souls

3150.88 --> 3156.48
because everybody knows you are insane

3154.559 --> 3158.7200000000003
you think that everybody in the freaking

3156.48 --> 3161.92
world is a devil except you

3158.72 --> 3165.5989999999997
you literally have confessed

3161.92 --> 3166.0
communion with spirits that told you

3165.599 --> 3170.48
this

3166.0 --> 3181.119
[ __ ] you're a creepy [ __ ] dude

3170.48 --> 3182.48
creepy as [ __ ] yeah i know zack sterling

3181.119 --> 3184.559
you're new here

3182.48 --> 3185.839
well he's been around for a long time i

3184.559 --> 3190.0
even did a

3185.839 --> 3193.7599999999998
face-to-face or well camera fit

3190.0 --> 3195.68
on video interview with him

3193.76 --> 3197.3590000000004
in the flatter talks days it's still

3195.68 --> 3200.319
uploaded on my channel

3197.359 --> 3201.5989999999997
it was before i figured out he is a

3200.319 --> 3204.0
creepy scumbag

3201.599 --> 3205.119
that's just out to attack and discredit

3204.0 --> 3208.48
everybody

3205.119 --> 3210.48
in his own view i just thought hey this

3208.48 --> 3210.72
is actually somebody that has some kind

3210.48 --> 3212.8
of

3210.72 --> 3214.7999999999997
alternative interpretation of the flat

3212.8 --> 3215.92
earth and doesn't just straight out

3214.8 --> 3218.1600000000003
thinking it's a disc

3215.92 --> 3219.119
it must be a disk because of the map it

3218.16 --> 3220.7999999999997
looks like a disc

3219.119 --> 3222.48
he was one of the few people out there

3220.8 --> 3223.04
that actually had his own idea so i

3222.48 --> 3225.119
thought

3223.04 --> 3226.96
yeah somebody with his own idea let's be

3225.119 --> 3230.0
friends and then he turned out to be

3226.96 --> 3237.839
completely insane scumbags of agony

3230.0 --> 3237.839
yeah here goes another disappointment

3246.88 --> 3250.0
but that was years ago like three or

3249.44 --> 3253.52
four years

3250.0 --> 3255.44
ago now but he's still hanging around in

3253.52 --> 3257.7599999999998
the background trying to collect

3255.44 --> 3259.599
dirt so he can blabber on about how

3257.76 --> 3260.1600000000003
everybody in the world is a freaking

3259.599 --> 3262.96
chill

3260.16 --> 3264.8799999999997
and it's all fake except of course him

3262.96 --> 3267.44
he still does that [ __ ]

3264.88 --> 3269.28
to this day it's really pathetic and he

3267.44 --> 3272.7200000000003
actually believes it himself

3269.28 --> 3272.7200000000003
that's the most pathetic part

3274.48 --> 3279.839
hello aramis don stone

3289.52 --> 3296.079
it was too hard for alex to turn flat

3293.28 --> 3297.28
right because he's a meatball he doesn't

3296.079 --> 3299.3590000000004
want to be flat

3297.28 --> 3301.52
he wants the world to be round like

3299.359 --> 3304.799
himself

3301.52 --> 3308.319
he wants the ball he is the ball he is

3304.799 --> 3308.319
making everything a ball

3308.64 --> 3312.16
it has to be a ball because he can't

3310.72 --> 3314.319
live in a world

3312.16 --> 3315.92
where it's just this world he can't

3314.319 --> 3318.88
accept it

3315.92 --> 3320.96
there has to be infinite resources out

3318.88 --> 3325.28
there somewhere

3320.96 --> 3325.28
so that he can gravel on forever

3326.48 --> 3330.48
he has to have that imagination fantasy

3329.04 --> 3332.799
for himself that

3330.48 --> 3334.16
there is infinite resources and so he

3332.799 --> 3335.7599999999998
can dream about oh

3334.16 --> 3339.359
look i found an asteroid and now we've

3335.76 --> 3340.2400000000002
got a 100 million kilograms of pure gold

3339.359 --> 3343.2799999999997
or platinum

3340.24 --> 3345.359
he wants that he wants that fantasy he

3343.28 --> 3348.7200000000003
won't let it go

3345.359 --> 3350.72
there has to be infinite resources

3348.72 --> 3354.8799999999997
cannot accept that there is a finite

3350.72 --> 3354.8799999999997
amount of material he cannot accept it

3356.4 --> 3360.48
alex jones must know is flat no he's a

3358.88 --> 3364.4
religious zealot he does not

3360.48 --> 3368.079
allow himself to realize

3364.4 --> 3371.76
what is true he does not allow himself

3368.079 --> 3372.96
he literally is friends with astronauts

3371.76 --> 3376.1600000000003
and [ __ ]

3372.96 --> 3379.2
he got them on his show he's so

3376.16 --> 3381.7599999999998
far invested into heliocentrism

3379.2 --> 3383.839
and the dream of it he does not allow

3381.76 --> 3386.48
himself to realize what is true

3383.839 --> 3386.88
he's been confronted it life with it

3386.48 --> 3389.28
life

3386.88 --> 3390.1600000000003
on air where he would literally just

3389.28 --> 3393.3590000000004
start acting

3390.16 --> 3395.04
really weird you know why because he

3393.359 --> 3398.0789999999997
psychologically does not

3395.04 --> 3399.04
allow himself to realize it like a

3398.079 --> 3402.88
religious

3399.04 --> 3404.88
baller zealot which is what he is

3402.88 --> 3406.2400000000002
and he's just twisted in all kinds of

3404.88 --> 3408.88
directions because of it

3406.24 --> 3409.839
because he does not allow it and he sees

3408.88 --> 3411.599
what we do

3409.839 --> 3412.96
at the flat earth debates and the actual

3411.599 --> 3416.7200000000003
argumentations

3412.96 --> 3420.48
as an attack on his

3416.72 --> 3421.52
thing on his truth so he literally tries

3420.48 --> 3425.28
to water it down

3421.52 --> 3428.24
and mix in facts like saying oh this is

3425.28 --> 3429.6800000000003
like this is ridiculous we all know

3428.24 --> 3432.72
scientific truth

3429.68 --> 3434.16
like gravity and boiling water he does

3432.72 --> 3438.48
that on purpose

3434.16 --> 3441.7599999999998
he's sabotaging the landscape

3438.48 --> 3444.64
he's sabotaging

3441.76 --> 3444.96
people with that on purpose because he's

3444.64 --> 3448.799
a

3444.96 --> 3451.359
[ __ ] scumbag he knows

3448.799 --> 3451.92
he is sabotaging people's understanding

3451.359 --> 3455.839
with that

3451.92 --> 3458.799
he knows that part he doesn't

3455.839 --> 3460.799
know the earth is flat but he knows he's

3458.799 --> 3462.799
lying about that and manipulating people

3460.799 --> 3466.0
he knows that part

3462.799 --> 3469.7599999999998
it's a real scumbag grabbler thing i

3466.0 --> 3472.839
hate him hate him

3469.76 --> 3476.0
you're a scumbag alex jones you're

3472.839 --> 3477.119
disgusting you have no more excuses left

3476.0 --> 3480.079
for anything

3477.119 --> 3482.319
you've just become a scumbag and you

3480.079 --> 3486.4
should step away

3482.319 --> 3487.52
and just stay off camera and stay away

3486.4 --> 3490.0
from microphones

3487.52 --> 3490.88
because there's just garbage and [ __ ]

3490.0 --> 3494.559
coming out now

3490.88 --> 3498.1600000000003
everybody is just hating you

3494.559 --> 3499.2000000000003
for what you've become and the more time

3498.16 --> 3502.48
passes you more

3499.2 --> 3504.799
you keep doing this the more all the

3502.48 --> 3508.0
value of what you've done in the past

3504.799 --> 3510.4
will just fade away people won't

3508.0 --> 3511.2
care anymore for what you've done

3510.4 --> 3514.64
they'll just

3511.2 --> 3520.24
see you for what you are now a low

3514.64 --> 3520.24
life grappling lying scumbag

3525.28 --> 3528.4
kind of like joe rogan yeah that's right

3527.44 --> 3530.799
but he's

3528.4 --> 3532.559
he's been more much worse for a much

3530.799 --> 3536.72
longer time

3532.559 --> 3540.48
because rogan rogan is not a zealous

3536.72 --> 3541.68
baller believer he's not a religious

3540.48 --> 3545.839
zealot he actually

3541.68 --> 3549.52
knows rogan is just a unrepentant

3545.839 --> 3551.52
liar he lies and he knows it and he

3549.52 --> 3555.119
doesn't give a [ __ ]

3551.52 --> 3559.839
like at all so joe rogan like that

3555.119 --> 3559.839
is worse

3566.48 --> 3573.839
[Music]

3569.28 --> 3573.8390000000004
wow we said that that's insane

3582.61 --> 3586.1490000000003
[Music]

3590.96 --> 3594.079
i'm not surprised though

3597.839 --> 3604.96
because joe rogan man is so bad he's had

3601.44 --> 3608.079
like the worst of people like the

3604.96 --> 3611.2
really bad high level technocrats

3608.079 --> 3614.559
had them on and just sucked up to them

3611.2 --> 3619.359
probably literally too off camera

3614.559 --> 3622.96
like joe rogan is just really disgusting

3619.359 --> 3622.96
like he deserves every

3623.599 --> 3627.28
everything that owen benjamin basically

3626.559 --> 3629.599
talks about

3627.28 --> 3631.0400000000004
towards him he deserves it all all of it

3629.599 --> 3634.799
and more

3631.04 --> 3637.839
but it has to stay funny over there

3634.799 --> 3637.839
at home benjamin's

3639.28 --> 3642.7200000000003
but he deserves everything he's that's

3641.44 --> 3646.64
coming to him every

3642.72 --> 3646.64
every detail and more

3653.359 --> 3658.4
all he caught was a crappy orange jacket

3656.16 --> 3658.3999999999996
what

3666.88 --> 3671.839
joe smokes too much weed i don't think

3669.2 --> 3671.839
so

3672.48 --> 3678.559
i don't know does he smoke more than i

3676.4 --> 3678.559
do

3678.64 --> 3682.4
i don't think that the weed is the real

3680.559 --> 3683.52
problem i think that's all the other

3682.4 --> 3699.839
[ __ ] that he takes

3683.52 --> 3699.839
is the real problem

3700.4 --> 3704.319
anyway i hope you guys and gals

3702.4 --> 3706.48
appreciate this

3704.319 --> 3708.48
not going to do that every day but this

3706.48 --> 3711.599
was coming for a while

3708.48 --> 3713.839

3711.599 --> 3713.839
do that

3718.0 --> 3721.839

3878.839 --> 3881.839
about

3891.119 --> 3895.44
i probably don't want to read that well

3893.599 --> 3897.28
why don't you tell me what it's about

3895.44 --> 3899.28
because you're just inserting random

3897.28 --> 3903.76
words i don't even know

3899.28 --> 3903.76
what or who you're referring to tintin

3906.839 --> 3909.839
wayne

3922.48 --> 3930.079
owen smith really

3926.559 --> 3933.599
you think owen benjamin is a drug pusher

3930.079 --> 3937.2000000000003
george sanford are you out of your mind

3933.599 --> 3941.039

3941.039 --> 3948.2400000000002
pushing george sanford

3945.119 --> 3949.839
because you better give me a damn good

3948.24 --> 3951.0389999999998
reason for that i'm taking away your

3949.839 --> 3955.0389999999998
wrench

3951.039 --> 3955.039
because that's just overt slander

3960.0 --> 3963.119
yeah owen smith that's owen benjamin's

3962.64 --> 3965.839
name

3963.119 --> 3965.839

he is in with a supplement company

3970.72 --> 3980.72
what supplement company

3978.079 --> 3983.28

3980.72 --> 3983.2799999999997
drugs

3985.68 --> 3990.319
yeah i know his real name is smith

3991.119 --> 3997.2000000000003
he's been open about that his real name

3994.48 --> 3998.0
is smith you know why because there was

3997.2 --> 4001.0389999999998
another

3998.0 --> 4003.359
owen smith and he didn't want to take

4001.039 --> 4004.6400000000003
that name so he chose the artist name of

4003.359 --> 4007.7599999999998
benjamin instead

4004.64 --> 4008.0789999999997
yeah he's open about it he's not hiding

4007.76 --> 4010.7200000000003
it

4008.079 --> 4013.28
so can you please explain to me what

4010.72 --> 4013.2799999999997
drugs

george sanford yeah that's right zack

4028.48 --> 4033.839
sterling you should be careful

4030.319 --> 4035.52

4033.839 --> 4038.0
slander if you're gonna

4035.52 --> 4040.96
accuse somebody you better damn bring

4038.0 --> 4040.96
some freaking proof

4052.079 --> 4056.1600000000003
i'm not appreciating any of this george

4060.839 --> 4063.839
sanford

4068.079 --> 4072.4
yeah sure you do that and then you

4070.799 --> 4075.68
actually bring some proof

4072.4 --> 4077.44
that he is in with them right

4075.68 --> 4079.08

4092.72 --> 4097.599
that

4093.119 --> 4097.599
when they actually think it is a mistake

oh and sure well owen troy is just in

4101.279 --> 4106.56
with the

4102.88 --> 4110.799
with the infowars store company so yeah

4106.56 --> 4110.799
overtly selling drugs that's right

4113.279 --> 4118.88
or non classified drugs

4116.319 --> 4121.359
that are effectively still potentially

4118.88 --> 4121.359
addictive

4122.719 --> 4133.839
but yeah so is sugar

4136.48 --> 4141.199
well that's good for you tucker i know

4139.04 --> 4143.199
i've never denied that his supplements

4141.199 --> 4146.3189999999995
are actually good

4143.199 --> 4149.839
it's just that he's a [ __ ] scumbag

4146.319 --> 4153.120000000001
and he's actually tried to

4149.839 --> 4157.4
just like

4153.12 --> 4160.719
play into addictive behavior

4157.4 --> 4161.12
overtly in his advertisements which is a

4160.719 --> 4165.92
real

4161.12 --> 4168.719
scumbag thing to do really bad

4165.92 --> 4170.96

4183.359 --> 4187.1990000000005
and i still appreciate that it exists

4185.279 --> 4190.56
and that he sells it

4187.199 --> 4193.3589999999995
if he wasn't such a freaking scumbag

4190.56 --> 4195.52

[Music]

4228.84 --> 4231.84
one

4234.0 --> 4245.84
rfb i don't know what that means

4247.84 --> 4254.96
right so yeah i'd i'd be delighted with

4252.0 --> 4256.0
infowars and alex jones if he just sold

4254.96 --> 4259.199
his products and

4256.0 --> 4260.159
stopped being a disgusting grabbler and

4259.199 --> 4263.28
actually

4260.159 --> 4264.96
start acting like a respectable decent

4263.28 --> 4267.679
human being again that's

4264.96 --> 4268.719
not constantly trying to manipulate

4267.679 --> 4271.36
everybody

4268.719 --> 4272.56
into his stupid delusional railroad

4271.36 --> 4274.719
plans

4272.56 --> 4278.080000000001
right if you just stop doing that i'd

4274.719 --> 4280.08
actually respect him again

4278.08 --> 4282.719
and he's not doing it he's just becoming

4280.08 --> 4284.64
worse and worse and worse

4282.719 --> 4286.56
so yeah in the face of that i don't

4284.64 --> 4287.4400000000005
really care anymore he's got good

4286.56 --> 4290.2390000000005
supplements

4287.44 --> 4290.719
because he is becoming a scumbag and

4290.239 --> 4296.08
that's

4290.719 --> 4296.08
never a good thing no excuse

4298.159 --> 4301.36
and you might have noticed i'm not

4300.08 --> 4303.76
telling anybody to

4301.36 --> 4305.199
not buy his products anymore i just

4303.76 --> 4307.76
don't want to hold back

4305.199 --> 4309.919999999999
i just want to tell him exactly what he

4307.76 --> 4314.8
is

4309.92 --> 4318.8
stop being a lying scumbag grabbler

4314.8 --> 4321.84
repent your ways not your

4318.8 --> 4324.88
political opinions or plans

4321.84 --> 4329.84
just your ways stop acting

4324.88 --> 4332.56
like a decent human being again

4329.84 --> 4332.56
how about that

4333.36 --> 4340.48
oh oh you're tied in with certain people

4337.28 --> 4344.159
with certain agendas and you can't

4340.48 --> 4347.599999999999
oh well then just [ __ ] kill yourself

4344.159 --> 4349.92
i don't give a [ __ ] you've done that

4347.6 --> 4351.679
you've literally signed on to an agenda

4349.92 --> 4353.36
where you knew you were going to have to

4351.679 --> 4356.4
destroy yourself

4353.36 --> 4359.04
okay then [ __ ] end it your

4356.4 --> 4360.4
[ __ ] problem you did it you were dumb

4359.04 --> 4364.239
enough to go for it

4360.4 --> 4371.759999999999
oh you did it it's your problem

4364.239 --> 4373.839999999999
not my problem

4371.76 --> 4375.6
this is getting dark yeah it's also

4373.84 --> 4378.159000000001
getting the truth

4375.6 --> 4379.4400000000005
it's obviously he signed on to a dark

4378.159 --> 4382.719
agenda

4379.44 --> 4384.799999999999
he took a ticket don't know exactly the

4382.719 --> 4388.2390000000005
nature of the ticket it's probably a

4384.8 --> 4390.400000000001
nasa related ticket

4388.239 --> 4391.839999999999
right and once you take that you can't

4390.4 --> 4395.28
get out they make you

4391.84 --> 4398.8
destroy yourself slowly under

4395.28 --> 4400.96
whatever pretense deal

4398.8 --> 4402.08
system it's what's happening it's what

4400.96 --> 4406.64
he's doing

4402.08 --> 4406.64
he caused this it's his own damn fault

4410.239 --> 4413.839999999999
i don't know what drumming is

4415.6 --> 4418.56
it's not a word

4421.44 --> 4426.08
i'm so beaten up because he used to be a

4424.64 --> 4430.320000000001
great guy

4426.08 --> 4430.32
i learned a lot from his teaching

4430.56 --> 4434.719
oh you're calling me a dark elf well i'm

4432.88 --> 4437.04
gonna give you a timeout for that

4434.719 --> 4441.76
[ __ ] don't ever freaking call me or

4437.04 --> 4445.04
suggest i'm a dark elf

4441.76 --> 4446.64
it's not getting any of that i'm just

4445.04 --> 4450.32
giving

4446.64 --> 4453.76
my opinion about something the way it is

4450.32 --> 4454.08
the way i see it and i'm not gonna hold

4453.76 --> 4457.679
back

4454.08 --> 4461.6
for any reason or for any past

4457.679 --> 4461.6
things that are supposedly good

4463.76 --> 4469.84
i'm just going to address it exactly

4465.92 --> 4469.84
what i think about it right now

4474.719 --> 4480.8
he never was a great guy

4477.76 --> 4482.96
that's a matter of perspective i did

4480.8 --> 4485.84
very much appreciate some things that he

4482.96 --> 4485.84
did in the past

4494.48 --> 4498.08
he told us part truth how does that make

4496.8 --> 4501.92
him a great guy

4498.08 --> 4504.0
well the part truth

4501.92 --> 4505.28
if he hadn't done that i'd probably

4504.0 --> 4508.239
never know

4505.28 --> 4508.88
i would now be trying to find out but

4508.239 --> 4513.04
because

4508.88 --> 4515.36
that part truth in the past he gave that

4513.04 --> 4517.92
i figured it out and on the way i

4515.36 --> 4520.639999999999
figured out that it was a part truth

4517.92 --> 4521.36
it's easier to get a part truth and then

4520.64 --> 4524.159000000001
try to

4521.36 --> 4526.239
figure out the lies that are not that

4524.159 --> 4529.36
are the other part

4526.239 --> 4539.678999999999
early than to just never hear

4529.36 --> 4544.08
any part of the truth at all

4539.679 --> 4546.96
i'm not saying he was ever a great guy

4544.08 --> 4547.84
i didn't i still really appreciated what

4546.96 --> 4553.84
he did

4547.84 --> 4553.84
but he's just all turning into [ __ ] now

4567.84 --> 4572.96
what are they turning your internet off

4570.0 --> 4575.04
again do i have to say that every time

4572.96 --> 4578.4
to make them turn the internet off of

4575.04 --> 4578.4
reduce mark smiler

4578.84 --> 4583.28
right are you gonna stop commenting

4581.199 --> 4586.08
about it if i say it enough

4583.28 --> 4589.04
because they will turn it off then maybe

4586.08 --> 4592.4
i should say it more often

4589.04 --> 4594.56
it's just annoying like i don't care

4592.4 --> 4597.92
that you have internet issue it's not my

4594.56 --> 4597.92
issue it's your issue

4598.0 --> 4608.159
there's no reason for you to share that

4600.719 --> 4611.28

4619.28 --> 4623.84
i guess nathan oakley at this point

4633.92 --> 4642.32
do i have pyramids where i live [ __ ]

4638.8 --> 4642.320000000001
kind of a question is that

4642.56 --> 4645.6
thank you though it's really funny i do

4644.96 --> 4648.88
need it

4645.6 --> 4652.56
i did need a laugh so thanks

4648.88 --> 4652.56
no there's no pyramids in the

4662.84 --> 4665.84
netherlands

4666.239 --> 4679.839999999999
at least not that i know of if they

4668.239 --> 4679.839999999999
build one they build one in secret

4694.239 --> 4698.4
why are you expecting there to be

4696.159 --> 4707.839999999999
pyramids everywhere

4698.4 --> 4707.839999999999
it's not a common thing

4708.32 --> 4711.599999999999
why do they build pyramids everywhere

4710.56 --> 4713.52
well they

4711.6 --> 4715.679
don't really build pyramids everywhere

4713.52 --> 4718.96
not the pyramids where which

4715.679 --> 4719.679
in my opinion my research are very

4718.96 --> 4724.2390000000005
likely

4719.679 --> 4727.36
ancient hydroelectrostatic generators

4724.239 --> 4730.0
right but the pyramid has become a

4727.36 --> 4733.5199999999995
symbol for insight

4730.0 --> 4735.6
for yeah the eye on the pyramid

4733.52 --> 4737.120000000001
which kind of refers back to hey the

4735.6 --> 4740.0
ancients had a lot of

4737.12 --> 4742.08
insight and technology and advancement

4740.0 --> 4743.199
that we no longer understand we just see

4742.08 --> 4745.76
that structure

4743.199 --> 4747.36
so the eye on the pyramid is kind of a

4745.76 --> 4750.400000000001
symbol for that

4747.36 --> 4750.88
and that they want to rub off they want

4750.4 --> 4752.96
to be

4750.88 --> 4755.36
the secret keepers of the knowledge and

4752.96 --> 4757.36
so they use pyramids

4755.36 --> 4758.4
symbolically so they like to build

4757.36 --> 4761.04
pyramids

4758.4 --> 4763.199
for that not for an actual physical

4761.04 --> 4766.4
function like the original pyramids

4763.199 --> 4768.96
but for their occult [ __ ] for

4766.4 --> 4770.799999999999
being another symbol for being a special

4768.96 --> 4773.199
boy that has all the secret knowledge

4770.8 --> 4777.84
that's why they build pyramids because

4773.199 --> 4777.839999999999
they think they're special boys

i'm a big fan of alpha power i don't

4809.84 --> 4813.76
really need it that much but i do

4812.48 --> 4817.12
appreciate it

4813.76 --> 4819.04
that's again again i can't stand

4817.12 --> 4821.679
alex jones anymore i can't stand what

4819.04 --> 4823.76
he's done i can't stand his choices

help me grow up in a tough time right

4855.84 --> 4860.2390000000005
that yeah the guy it's coming from is

4858.8 --> 4875.84
kind of disgusting now

4884.639 --> 4892.08
what a pyramid of ouster elites

4889.52 --> 4892.080000000001
all right

4892.639 --> 4903.84
i think i vaguely remember that but

4896.08 --> 4906.4
are you is that really a pyramid

4903.84 --> 4917.84
that's weird i'm gonna have to look that

4906.4 --> 4917.839999999999
up actually

4933.36 --> 4936.639
oh right that thing

4936.88 --> 4941.28
that's weird it's not really

4941.36 --> 4945.44
pyramid in my opinion it's pyramidal

4943.6 --> 4947.92
it's just like

4945.44 --> 4951.04
incomplete pyramid with a stupid obelisk

4947.92 --> 4954.2390000000005

4979.92 --> 4982.4
know that

4988.159 --> 4991.759999999999
i completely forgot about that

4998.96 --> 5004.639
oh jason key [ __ ] off

5005.28 --> 5009.92
yeah and by the way people donate to my

5007.36 --> 5009.92
paypal

5010.48 --> 5015.599999999999
because when you do that you're all very

5013.84 --> 5018.96
special

5015.6 --> 5018.96
according to jason c

5020.639 --> 5029.84
and i can still use the support

5031.28 --> 5037.84
and apparently i feed people with

5033.28 --> 5037.84
fantasy world [ __ ] according to him

5039.44 --> 5046.0
except that not really i'm always very

5043.199 --> 5048.719
detailed about the things that i say and

5046.0 --> 5050.639
what context it should be taken but

5048.719 --> 5053.28
the guy probably does not have the

5050.639 --> 5056.56
sensibility left to even distinguish

5053.28 --> 5060.08
between the approach

5056.56 --> 5061.76
preset for a story he doesn't have the

5060.08 --> 5062.159
faculties left for that because he's

5061.76 --> 5066.0
just

5062.159 --> 5067.839999999999
used to as long as it is supportive of

5066.0 --> 5070.48
the heliocentrism

5067.84 --> 5072.32
it's all right yeah and when you do that

5070.48 --> 5074.919999999999
your entire life

5072.32 --> 5076.239
you don't pay attention anymore to the

5074.92 --> 5078.639
precursor

5076.239 --> 5080.48
of a story you don't pay attention

5078.639 --> 5082.96
anymore you just pay attention

5080.48 --> 5085.5199999999995
whether it resonates with heliocentrism

5082.96 --> 5089.679
now doesn't it huh

5085.52 --> 5094.56
so you don't have the senses left

5089.679 --> 5097.1990000000005
to even distinguish what i'm saying

5094.56 --> 5100.0
and what it means in the wider context

5097.199 --> 5100.0
jason c

5100.08 --> 5104.08
but that's fine no i'm not zen

5101.92 --> 5106.4800000000005
meditating i don't meditate like that i

5104.08 --> 5108.8
don't need still moments

5106.48 --> 5110.959999999999
i already naturally meditate when i

5108.8 --> 5112.0
sleep i have to because otherwise i

5110.96 --> 5114.719
can't sleep

5112.0 --> 5116.8
and i've learned that very young because

5114.719 --> 5118.56
my mind never stands still so i

5116.8 --> 5122.88
basically have to

5118.56 --> 5123.6
transition myself into sleep mode while

5122.88 --> 5126.719
i'm still

5123.6 --> 5128.4800000000005
mentally active it happens so literally

5126.719 --> 5129.92
i'm just used to basically go into sort

5128.48 --> 5132.718999999999
of meditation mode

5129.92 --> 5134.159
and then as i'm thinking that thinking

5132.719 --> 5136.0
slowly transitions

5134.159 --> 5138.48
outside of my consciousness into

5136.0 --> 5141.36
dreaming and continues on until i wake

5138.48 --> 5144.879999999999
up in the morning

5141.36 --> 5147.839999999999
and that's how i sleep i sleep in a

5144.88 --> 5147.84
meditative state

5148.88 --> 5152.4800000000005
anyway i'm rounding out the show so
