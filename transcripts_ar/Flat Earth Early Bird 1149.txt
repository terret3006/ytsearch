night so

193.68 --> 198.48000000000002
when i woke up today it was like 10

195.68 --> 200.56
minutes to one

198.48 --> 203.2
but yeah it's nice to wake up to this

200.56 --> 203.2
type of weather

209.76 --> 213.51899999999998
right

210.879 --> 215.51899999999998
so yeah my birthday yesterday overall

213.519 --> 219.44
was

215.519 --> 222.87900000000002
nice and calm kind of uneventful

219.44 --> 222.879
but yeah i don't mind

224.799 --> 228.799
don't really like it too much

227.44 --> 230.72
every time like

228.799 --> 231.76000000000002
during a birthday like everybody

230.72 --> 234.239
suddenly

231.76 --> 234.239
starts

235.439 --> 239.84
yeah

236.72 --> 243.2
getting all celebratory

239.84 --> 243.20000000000002
like the calm birthdays

245.12 --> 250.12
anyway hello jeff gassett good to see

247.12 --> 250.12
you

258.639 --> 265.12
so yeah yesterday's show was pretty good

261.68 --> 265.12
and a lot of vision talk

266.639 --> 270.639
i haven't like watched it back but i

268.32 --> 272.639
just remember like yeah half of that was

270.639 --> 275.36
vision talk

272.639 --> 276.72
and the other half was i think mostly

275.36 --> 279.28000000000003
flat earth

276.72 --> 279.28000000000003
related

281.36 --> 284.96000000000004
right i'd have to watch it back to

283.04 --> 288.08000000000004
remember

284.96 --> 292.44
or be reminded of it by you guys anyway

288.08 --> 292.44
hello psych bear good to see you

298.479 --> 303.59999999999997
yeah michael khan had

300.16 --> 303.6
uploaded a couple of videos

304.24 --> 308.12
a whole bunch of them actually

316.0 --> 321.68
one had a really christian song in it

319.52 --> 323.52
that i thought was actually kind of nice

321.68 --> 325.84000000000003
weird but nice

323.52 --> 325.84
uh

326.32 --> 328.96
let's see

327.759 --> 331.199
what else

328.96 --> 331.19899999999996
oh yeah

331.37 --> 334.439
[Music]

337.36 --> 341.52000000000004
brian

338.479 --> 346.08
has been uploading more short

341.52 --> 346.08
technical videos and he had one this

350.84 --> 356.15999999999997
morning i think it was this morning

354.88 --> 358.56
did he

356.16 --> 360.8
post that much earlier no remember let's

358.56 --> 360.8
see

362.16 --> 365.8
yeah it was from yesterday

368.639 --> 372.16
how

369.919 --> 374.15999999999997
a certain type of spy plane

372.16 --> 375.759
x15

374.16 --> 378.24
because of its speed

375.759 --> 379.84000000000003
it's technically impossible to

378.24 --> 382.0
function like that on the globe that's

379.84 --> 385.84
basically his video he makes a lot of

382.0 --> 388.639
these types of very technical videos

385.84 --> 390.15999999999997
in the recent weeks

388.639 --> 392.0
and yeah they're actually kind of

390.16 --> 394.40000000000003
interesting and seem to trigger the

392.0 --> 397.919
ballers a lot

394.4 --> 397.919
ryan's really getting good at that

399.68 --> 404.68
anyway

401.199 --> 404.68
low stone monkey

424.88 --> 429.36
without me having to use the internet

427.599 --> 430.88
does it rain in the netherlands quite

429.36 --> 433.599
often

430.88 --> 437.0
well not as much as it does in england

433.599 --> 437.0
but yes

440.96 --> 446.15999999999997
that just not constantly but it does

443.199 --> 449.28000000000003
rain pretty much all throughout the year

446.16 --> 451.91900000000004
it it it does typically rain at times at

449.28 --> 454.88
least all right

451.919 --> 456.96
hello mike sudonic good to see you

454.88 --> 459.96
christopher

456.96 --> 459.96
boujole

465.28 --> 468.0
adam price

472.0 --> 475.0
right

483.28 --> 487.35999999999996
um what's that jeff gas head

490.72 --> 495.03900000000004
ah mud fossil university okay

495.199 --> 498.72
oh from yesterday

505.12 --> 511.28000000000003
okay

507.36 --> 514.28
that looks halfway interesting

511.28 --> 514.28
hmm

531.519 --> 536.0
right

533.36 --> 538.5600000000001
watched oh benjamin of course yesterday

536.0 --> 541.839
as i said i would

538.56 --> 541.8389999999999
from what was it

545.519 --> 550.32
ah there's so many different clips these

547.76 --> 552.399
days it's kind of hard to

550.32 --> 554.48
keep track of it all

552.399 --> 557.04
but yeah the clips are probably very

554.48 --> 557.04
effective

557.76 --> 561.8389999999999
we're just

559.279 --> 563.68
some i don't know if he does it or like

561.839 --> 566.08
coddington or something

563.68 --> 569.279
one of his video managers

566.08 --> 571.519
basically cutting out snippets of things

569.279 --> 573.519
that he said during the stream

571.519 --> 575.76
to kind of like get the

573.519 --> 577.6
a concise point

575.76 --> 579.279
into a single video

577.6 --> 581.36
he's been doing that in like the last

579.279 --> 584.519
month and yeah it works

581.36 --> 584.519
i guess

591.839 --> 596.399
what is mutt fossil university that's a

594.72 --> 599.44
channel

596.399 --> 603.399
professor phil bell hello

599.44 --> 603.399
that's a youtube channel

611.6 --> 618.44
giants are kind of a big thing yeah

615.44 --> 618.44
literally

621.29 --> 624.429
[Music]

632.24 --> 636.0790000000001
all right you watch your own benjamin on

633.92 --> 638.3199999999999
odyssey christopher

636.079 --> 641.76
bujol

638.32 --> 645.36
yeah well he's over the place i i always

641.76 --> 647.519
go with edit through bit shoot

645.36 --> 650.24
because that's been just working

647.519 --> 650.24
very stable

657.839 --> 662.0
doing pretty good on tick tock well i've

660.16 --> 664.24
heard from him

662.0 --> 666.959
that it's kind of mixed

664.24 --> 669.279
so he does get like pretty explosive

666.959 --> 671.1199999999999
viewing number sometimes but then tick

669.279 --> 675.48
tock

671.12 --> 675.48
kind of gets in the way as well

681.12 --> 684.65
right

682.88 --> 686.24
hey what nice win

684.65 --> 689.72
[Music]

686.24 --> 689.72
get out of here

701.92 --> 705.8389999999999
all right

703.36 --> 708.32
don't make trouble or i'm banning you

705.839 --> 708.32
weirdo

708.56 --> 713.68
suck

710.24 --> 713.6800000000001
imitating flat earthers

715.279 --> 717.8389999999999
all right

719.2 --> 725.279
there's a lot of normies on tick tock

720.959 --> 725.279
yeah well it's a huge platform

728.8 --> 732.8
i mean i think tech talk

731.68 --> 735.76
like is

732.8 --> 738.24
or at least started out attempting to

735.76 --> 738.24
kind of be

739.36 --> 744.88
a competition a bit to youtube

742.399 --> 748.16
and just be more free

744.88 --> 751.36
but eventually like yeah that

748.16 --> 754.24
they do have some censorship issues so

751.36 --> 754.24
i've heard it's just

754.88 --> 760.0
you can still have like certain

757.2 --> 761.6
explosive numbers

760.0 --> 762.88
there

761.6 --> 764.9590000000001
it lets you

762.88 --> 766.32
like the algorithms let you through a

764.959 --> 767.92
lot more

766.32 --> 770.32
so i've heard i don't know i don't

767.92 --> 770.3199999999999
actually

770.48 --> 773.839
use tick-tock myself

779.279 --> 783.519
so the most that i remember tick-tock

781.279 --> 785.2
for is all the dancing nurses videos and

783.519 --> 787.36
all that

785.2 --> 790.72
that's when it really came

787.36 --> 790.72
into the attentions man

790.8 --> 798.039
probably out there in the world as well

794.96 --> 798.039
[Music]

813.12 --> 817.36
right yeah i am hoping by the way that

815.519 --> 821.199
nathan oakley is going to have a live

817.36 --> 822.9590000000001
stream again i don't know i haven't

821.199 --> 825.12
heard him give any updates on his

822.959 --> 829.8
condition yet

825.12 --> 829.8
i hope it's i hope he's doing well

855.76 --> 861.199
yes george sanford exactly

858.8 --> 861.199
hello

862.56 --> 865.5999999999999
the worst thing about the pandemic is

864.56 --> 869.0
all the dent

865.6 --> 869.0
you think so

870.56 --> 874.4799999999999
i don't know i think it's kind of been

872.48 --> 876.8000000000001
like a secret blessing in disguise

874.48 --> 876.8000000000001
because

876.88 --> 879.68
it's like a

879.92 --> 884.399
a really good hint

882.0 --> 886.32
that there's a lot of [ __ ] going down in

884.399 --> 888.8
the medical system

886.32 --> 890.639
right it was one of the first revealers

888.8 --> 891.4399999999999
like hey there's something wrong there's

890.639 --> 893.76
a

891.44 --> 894.9590000000001
disconnect with what the media is

893.76 --> 897.12
telling you

894.959 --> 900.079
about about the

897.12 --> 902.639
pandemic supposedly and what's actually

900.079 --> 904.4799999999999
happening in hospitals right it was the

902.639 --> 906.0790000000001
first hint at that

904.48 --> 908.9590000000001
i mean people were already like

906.079 --> 910.7199999999999
suspicious over pandemic narrative

908.959 --> 913.92
trying to figure it out but like the

910.72 --> 915.0400000000001
dancing nurses really

913.92 --> 918.24
like broke

915.04 --> 918.24
a certain type of dam

918.32 --> 921.7600000000001
very quickly

920.079 --> 926.68
so i think that the dancing nurses

921.76 --> 926.68
overall probably woke up more people

927.68 --> 931.92
than anything about the situation

932.72 --> 936.279
it was everywhere

940.32 --> 946.0
well it's like where out of the loop

943.199 --> 949.4399999999999
nathan is saying no nathan got wounded

946.0 --> 952.0
they had a working floor accident

949.44 --> 952.8800000000001
pretty severe

952.0 --> 955.839
so

952.88 --> 955.8389999999999
yeah

956.24 --> 961.6
and he had a

958.399 --> 964.0
minor complications too and all that

961.6 --> 966.48
in the weekend so i had to go to the

964.0 --> 970.32
hospital a couple of times

966.48 --> 970.32
but i should be doing all right

970.8 --> 975.5999999999999
all depends on how quickly he's healing

973.44 --> 977.9200000000001
up

975.6 --> 977.9200000000001
right

980.88 --> 985.88
hope he's all right yeah me too of

982.88 --> 985.88
course

1001.26 --> 1004.88
[Music]

1005.04 --> 1008.88
but yeah we'll see maybe he needs some

1007.199 --> 1012.7199999999999
more time you know

1008.88 --> 1012.72
look it could just turn out that

1013.279 --> 1017.759
like the

1014.8 --> 1020.16
the aftermath of healing up is gonna

1017.759 --> 1022.24
cost him more time maybe he'll need

1020.16 --> 1023.199
another week well i'd gladly give it to

1022.24 --> 1026.72
him

1023.199 --> 1029.4389999999999
i mean i i don't like missing

1026.72 --> 1031.76
the flat earth debate life

1029.439 --> 1034.0790000000002
but yeah i think it's important that he

1031.76 --> 1037.079
that he just makes sure he heals up

1034.079 --> 1037.079
properly

1038.559 --> 1042.6399999999999
hello chosen one

1041.12 --> 1044.2399999999998
are you dutch

1042.64 --> 1046.72
or you just

1044.24 --> 1049.1200000000001
you think it's amusing to like

1046.72 --> 1052.76
google translate stuff to dutch because

1049.12 --> 1052.76
you know i'm dutch

1073.79 --> 1079.6789999999999
[Music]

1076.72 --> 1083.1200000000001
yeah light before the tunnel

1079.679 --> 1083.1200000000001
yeah that's what they all do

1083.44 --> 1088.0800000000002
right yeah the the premiere nathan has

1085.919 --> 1090.3200000000002
been replaying from what is it last

1088.08 --> 1092.3999999999999
monday

1090.32 --> 1096.6399999999999
a couple of times because like yeah

1092.4 --> 1099.44
there was no thursday and friday show

1096.64 --> 1102.16
it was constantly about that

1099.44 --> 1104.0800000000002
about that guy that came in that was

1102.16 --> 1107.28
like modeling around and he's like yeah

1104.08 --> 1107.28
it fits on any model

1107.44 --> 1112.16
that is because it's all celestial

1110.48 --> 1114.08
sphere based

1112.16 --> 1116.16
all the projections are actually

1114.08 --> 1118.3999999999999
celestial sphere-based the map is

1116.16 --> 1121.44
actually secondary

1118.4 --> 1124.48
to the celestial sphere

1121.44 --> 1127.1200000000001
in the process of making it right

1124.48 --> 1128.64
and that's what all ballers do because

1127.12 --> 1131.1999999999998
that's how it works that's how it's

1128.64 --> 1133.039
constructed that's the way you have to

1131.2 --> 1137.559
follow it

1133.039 --> 1137.559
because that is what it is

1143.679 --> 1146.96
so it always starts with the lights in

1145.52 --> 1149.2
the sky

1146.96 --> 1152.559
and then making assumptions making

1149.2 --> 1156.44
geometric considerations

1152.559 --> 1156.44
in relation to that

1173.36 --> 1179.3999999999999
doesn't matter

1175.12 --> 1179.3999999999999
no chosen i was just asking

1179.6 --> 1183.9189999999999
like are you dutch

1181.52 --> 1187.28
or do you think it's just amusing to

1183.919 --> 1187.2800000000002
look up stuff in dutch

1189.44 --> 1192.96
because i don't know if you're dutch

1191.2 --> 1195.52
that's just fine

1192.96 --> 1197.3600000000001
but yeah i don't particularly like

1195.52 --> 1201.72
being addressed in it in dutch because

1197.36 --> 1201.7199999999998
other people don't understand it

1208.96 --> 1211.919
are you getting wisdom

1212.32 --> 1219.3999999999999
you have a dutch oven okay

1215.52 --> 1219.4
how incredibly relevant

1223.039 --> 1227.4
i don't even know what that is actually

1243.679 --> 1248.159
hey stuff with traffic i'm arrested how

1245.36 --> 1251.28
are you doing

1248.159 --> 1251.2800000000002
hey see me traveler

1252.24 --> 1255.919
got a nicer full chat today

1256.799 --> 1260.48
doesn't know what a dutch oven is

1260.64 --> 1264.64
well i doubt that in dutch we call it

1263.6 --> 1267.6399999999999
the same

1264.64 --> 1267.64
thing

1280.64 --> 1282.96
okay

1283.6 --> 1288.48
from my google result it seems like a

1285.919 --> 1290.64
dutch oven

1288.48 --> 1293.28
is just like a pan

1290.64 --> 1293.2800000000002
apparently

1294.96 --> 1297.1200000000001
and

1298.159 --> 1302.88
okay i guess

1300.32 --> 1306.559
that's very dutch enough for

1302.88 --> 1308.64
non-dutch to call it a dutch oven

1306.559 --> 1310.48
i guess that it is

1308.64 --> 1312.4
in the traditional

1310.48 --> 1313.6
dutch cuisine

1312.4 --> 1315.2
such

1313.6 --> 1319.0
dutch ovens would

1315.2 --> 1319.0
be used a lot

1322.32 --> 1326.3999999999999
because we liked our cook cooked potato

1325.039 --> 1328.64
with

1326.4 --> 1331.3600000000001
like some beef and

1328.64 --> 1333.5200000000002
vegetables and then

1331.36 --> 1335.84
yeah

1333.52 --> 1338.84
right okay that's called the dutch oven

1335.84 --> 1338.84
apparently

1367.6 --> 1370.32
what the hell

1371.44 --> 1376.4
okay chosen one that's that's just gross

1381.76 --> 1387.8799999999999
touch oven with that no

1383.919 --> 1387.88
no i'm not gonna do that

1392.799 --> 1398.1589999999999
hey flatter stage good to see you

1396.08 --> 1402.84
dutch food sounds pretty good

1398.159 --> 1402.8400000000001
good well it is kind of rich

1412.08 --> 1416.6399999999999
that's a dutch oven

1413.679 --> 1418.64
oh well that's really gross i don't even

1416.64 --> 1421.039
want to know how you know that kind of

1418.64 --> 1424.88
[ __ ] i don't want to know when i

1421.039 --> 1426.48
googled it it actually yielded

1424.88 --> 1427.919
frying pans

1426.48 --> 1428.96
or not like

1427.919 --> 1430.96
stove

1428.96 --> 1434.799
pots

1430.96 --> 1437.799
that were literally called dutch oven so

1434.799 --> 1437.799
right

1456.84 --> 1461.279
yeah

1458.48 --> 1461.279
oh god

1463.44 --> 1469.96
your opinion is based on evidence

1466.96 --> 1469.96
right

1494.08 --> 1500.9189999999999
yeah chosen one yeah that is gross it's

1496.32 --> 1500.9189999999999
gross enough for me not to want to know

1505.279 --> 1509.44
it's safe to say that i don't do that

1510.32 --> 1515.2
maybe it's a thing that because i don't

1512.799 --> 1517.9189999999999
know your women don't really know how to

1515.2 --> 1520.0
kick cook all that well

1517.919 --> 1521.679
that it's like a punishment or something

1520.0 --> 1524.72
it's like hey

1521.679 --> 1526.5590000000002
smell this yeah that's your cooking this

1524.72 --> 1528.48
is what happens maybe you should cook

1526.559 --> 1530.6399999999999
better i i don't know man that's like

1528.48 --> 1532.799
the only practical

1530.64 --> 1534.7990000000002
thing that i get related to other than

1532.799 --> 1539.24
that i just don't want to know okay i

1534.799 --> 1539.24
don't do that i do my own cooking

1547.919 --> 1554.3600000000001
that's okay rest ahead it's a little

1550.48 --> 1554.3600000000001
dramatic there but

1566.24 --> 1570.48
right yeah but here's the thing

1568.799 --> 1572.799
yeah chosen one

1570.48 --> 1574.96
don't call that a dutch oven that's a

1572.799 --> 1578.9189999999999
direct insult

1574.96 --> 1578.919
to my nation thanks

1589.36 --> 1592.36
do

1624.4 --> 1627.4
right

1628.48 --> 1634.24
that's like the only reasonable relation

1631.52 --> 1637.24
i can even tie into it and still

1634.24 --> 1637.24
no

1640.0 --> 1642.24
like

1642.88 --> 1647.7600000000002
i i'd have a lot of trouble

1646.0 --> 1651.2
letting this sounds weird by the way it

1647.76 --> 1653.679
led a lot of trouble letting a woman

1651.2 --> 1657.8400000000001
do my cooking

1653.679 --> 1658.72
because i've been i've grown up learning

1657.84 --> 1661.1999999999998
to be

1658.72 --> 1664.08
my own cook

1661.2 --> 1665.8400000000001
and for others and yeah with my ex i

1664.08 --> 1667.52
cooked

1665.84 --> 1669.52
and she was really happy about it

1667.52 --> 1672.24
because i was really freaking good and

1669.52 --> 1674.799
every time she tried something it was

1672.24 --> 1674.799
always like

1676.24 --> 1681.24
doable

1677.679 --> 1681.24
but not great

1682.08 --> 1685.4399999999998
i'd always be like

1684.159 --> 1687.3600000000001
basically

1685.44 --> 1689.039
standing there checking it out are you

1687.36 --> 1692.7199999999998
doing it all right

1689.039 --> 1692.72
because i'm i'm the cook

1692.88 --> 1696.5200000000002
it's what i do

1710.159 --> 1714.24
christopher brought it up did he

1717.279 --> 1722.6
when they start chatting in the middle

1719.279 --> 1722.6
of my show

1726.0 --> 1728.88
oh yeah he did

1730.88 --> 1736.159
but i think that christopher actually

1733.279 --> 1736.159
just meant

1736.559 --> 1740.399
like the stove pan

1738.799 --> 1743.76
i think that's what he meant you're the

1740.399 --> 1746.76
one that's bringing up that other thing

1743.76 --> 1746.76
so

1755.76 --> 1759.12
don't worry i'm not shooting the

1757.2 --> 1761.3600000000001
messenger

1759.12 --> 1765.8799999999999
but yeah i will

1761.36 --> 1765.8799999999999
i will light it on fire though

1776.08 --> 1779.08
do

1791.919 --> 1794.5590000000002

ah yeah thanks mitchell yeah it was

2264.56 --> 2267.56
yesterday

2281.44 --> 2285.2000000000003
it does give off a big brother vibe does

2283.92 --> 2287.52
it

2285.2 --> 2287.52
okay

2291.68 --> 2296.7599999999998
i don't think it's anything serious to

2293.68 --> 2296.7599999999998
it though

2302.24 --> 2308.0789999999997
big brother vibe the colors

2304.32 --> 2310.88
well i associate what he did with his

2308.079 --> 2313.92
icon that if you go to his channel you

2310.88 --> 2316.0
can see it enlarged

2313.92 --> 2319.52
i don't know i i associate that with a

2316.0 --> 2319.52
certain type of art style

2320.64 --> 2322.96
so

2321.68 --> 2325.44
remembering

2322.96 --> 2328.64
that that can be a thing from arts

2325.44 --> 2330.88
classes way back

2328.64 --> 2333.1189999999997
so i think it's actually kind of nice

2330.88 --> 2335.52
it's interesting

2333.119 --> 2339.48
to play around with like shadow

2335.52 --> 2339.48
contrasts like that

2340.56 --> 2344.64
yeah yeah thanks psychic psych bear

2352.48 --> 2357.28
michaen is very chavez

2354.88 --> 2360.079

2357.28 --> 2362.0
the same group of artists in the same

2360.079 --> 2367.2400000000002
time period that kind of invented that

2362.0 --> 2367.24
style did it to chavez too

2371.44 --> 2374.76
i don't know

2412.88 --> 2417.359
oh my god it's gonna be a squared off

2417.92 --> 2420.92

2427.599 --> 2433.56
just

2429.359 --> 2433.56
you knew this is gonna happen

2443.52 --> 2446.52
do

2467.76 --> 2471.6800000000003
hey

2469.119 --> 2471.6800000000003
what's this

2473.44 --> 2480.079
mitchell just started at premiere

2476.8 --> 2483.5600000000004
during my show dammit

2480.079 --> 2483.5600000000004
how dare you

2507.839 --> 2509.92
you

2524.0 --> 2527.0
so

2554.72 --> 2557.72
uh

2571.28 --> 2576.28
sorry i'm just looking around

2573.28 --> 2576.28
huh

2580.16 --> 2582.8799999999997
okay

2581.28 --> 2586.8
last warning

2582.88 --> 2586.8
chosen one last warning

2591.599 --> 2596.079
don't tell me

2592.88 --> 2597.76
oh you're to this you're too no i i told

2596.079 --> 2600.079
you directly

2597.76 --> 2603.119
shut up

2600.079 --> 2606.5600000000004
and when i say shut up i mean

2603.119 --> 2609.2000000000003
don't explain yourself again it means

2606.56 --> 2613.2799999999997
shut the [ __ ] up about it

2609.2 --> 2613.2799999999997
move on don't mention it

2613.68 --> 2619.8799999999997
yeah

2615.76 --> 2619.88
i don't want to tell you again

2626.72 --> 2632.7999999999997
have you ever accessed the akashic

2628.8 --> 2635.8
records and if so how is it done

2632.8 --> 2635.8
well

2636.079 --> 2638.88
access it

2639.359 --> 2645.4
is but is it ours to really even access

2642.16 --> 2645.3999999999996
like that

2648.079 --> 2652.48
i mean it's like god's library

2655.2 --> 2660.64
how do you access it

2657.2 --> 2662.96
either you attain access or you don't

2660.64 --> 2666.24
i don't know how that works that's like

2662.96 --> 2666.2400000000002
interdimensional [ __ ]

2669.2 --> 2674.319
it's just that i figured out the akashic

2671.92 --> 2676.48
library at a very young age

2674.319 --> 2679.44
and also the concept was explained to me

2676.48 --> 2683.04
at a very young age

2679.44 --> 2683.04
and it makes perfect sense to me

2688.88 --> 2693.92
but yeah i these days i just consider

2691.599 --> 2697.2000000000003
that all information comes directly from

2693.92 --> 2699.28
god like with everyone

2697.2 --> 2700.24
always

2699.28 --> 2702.5600000000004
so

2700.24 --> 2703.7599999999998
wherever the akashic library may be

2702.56 --> 2705.92
stored

2703.76 --> 2708.2400000000002
and all its logic and the naturally

2705.92 --> 2710.48
unfolding structures of

2708.24 --> 2712.7999999999997
reality and thinking

2710.48 --> 2716.839
because it's not just physical reality

2712.8 --> 2719.76
information it's also esoterics

2716.839 --> 2722.56
everything it's whatever god dispenses

2719.76 --> 2724.7200000000003
to you look whatever access you gain is

2722.56 --> 2725.599
what you get

2724.72 --> 2728.72
and

2725.599 --> 2731.3590000000004
depending on what you do with it

2728.72 --> 2734.24
you can become better at it and gain

2731.359 --> 2737.44
more access it's

2734.24 --> 2739.9199999999996
it's not just a cookie cutter

2737.44 --> 2742.4
procedure or something

2739.92 --> 2746.599
you don't buy membership right you just

2742.4 --> 2746.599
do it right and then it works

2774.0 --> 2778.88
you're useless at chess now well it's up

2776.0 --> 2780.96
to you like do you still want to train

2778.88 --> 2780.96
it

2781.359 --> 2786.52
because chess is a game you you have to

2783.52 --> 2786.52
train

2790.4 --> 2795.04
i've never been super good at it but i

2792.48 --> 2798.56
do have like an interesting type of

2795.04 --> 2801.68
strategy for it

2798.56 --> 2803.92
so instead of like perfecting

2801.68 --> 2806.3999999999996
interactive maneuver interactive

2803.92 --> 2808.96
maneuvering with chess

2806.4 --> 2809.839
instead of that

2808.96 --> 2812.8
i

2809.839 --> 2814.48
do my best to be as unexpected as

2812.8 --> 2816.48
possible

2814.48 --> 2818.64
that's kind of my strategy with that

2816.48 --> 2820.56
with chess because you don't really have

2818.64 --> 2822.48
to train all that well

2820.56 --> 2824.56
i can actually use my

2822.48 --> 2827.359
weird

2824.56 --> 2828.64
sort of telepathy skills to just

2827.359 --> 2831.119
figure out

2828.64 --> 2833.359
the opponent instead of figuring out the

2831.119 --> 2833.359
game

2833.52 --> 2839.64
but yeah i don't really play chess

2836.64 --> 2839.64
anymore

2854.24 --> 2857.24
hmm

2862.079 --> 2866.96
right well youtube yeah yeah that's hard

2864.4 --> 2869.839
to tell if he let you win maybe he just

2866.96 --> 2872.16
really liked playing chess

2869.839 --> 2874.72
it could be that too and you were just

2872.16 --> 2876.72
like oh finally somebody that that's

2874.72 --> 2877.7599999999998
playing that will play chess with me and

2876.72 --> 2880.0
then

2877.76 --> 2884.2000000000003
he might let you win because maybe he

2880.0 --> 2884.2
just really liked playing it

2906.72 --> 2913.16
fe experiments

2909.04 --> 2913.16
what do you mean fe experiments

2921.52 --> 2929.2
pretty [ __ ] there's no uh

2924.96 --> 2931.29
hypothesis involved in that

2929.2 --> 2934.3599999999997
i mean maybe they did some measuring

2931.29 --> 2934.36
[Music]

2934.88 --> 2939.839
but no i don't watch globe busters

2938.079 --> 2942.079
it's kind of boring

2939.839 --> 2943.2
in my opinion right and that say that's

2942.079 --> 2945.44
the guy

2943.2 --> 2947.04
saying with the daily show that has like

2945.44 --> 2950.079
huge long

2947.04 --> 2952.0
pauses with silence yeah

2950.079 --> 2953.76
and i still think globe busters is kind

2952.0 --> 2955.599
of boring

2953.76 --> 2957.28
because

2955.599 --> 2959.2000000000003
it's just

2957.28 --> 2961.599
it's not interesting

2959.2 --> 2961.5989999999997
to me

2962.48 --> 2966.2400000000002
the bus just performs observations at

2964.48 --> 2967.44
best right because that's what it's

2966.24 --> 2970.0
going to be

2967.44 --> 2972.64
i mean if you want to size up things

2970.0 --> 2975.839
like oh how are things here where how

2972.64 --> 2979.2
far is the horizon here blah blah blah

2975.839 --> 2981.359
yeah that's not a hypothesis

2979.2 --> 2984.68
right that's not an experiment that's

2981.359 --> 2984.68
just observations

2988.559 --> 2992.48
i still would like to call it tests

2990.64 --> 2996.24
because it emphasized doing something

2992.48 --> 2996.2400000000002
and expecting a result

2996.72 --> 3001.4399999999996
but curie doesn't like me using that too

2998.96 --> 3003.2
because you can do nothing you can say

3001.44 --> 3007.44
nothing

3003.2 --> 3007.4399999999996
no words are allowed to use ever

3007.52 --> 3012.4
it's like oh so i can call this

3010.48 --> 3015.359
and then no you can't use that oh so can

3012.4 --> 3017.839
i use that no no you just don't talk

3015.359 --> 3020.16
about it ever you can't use any words

3017.839 --> 3020.16
ever

3021.44 --> 3024.48
right

3022.48 --> 3027.44
can't call it a theory

3024.48 --> 3028.96
can't call it hypothetical can't call it

3027.44 --> 3030.559
a test

3028.96 --> 3033.119
ugh

3030.559 --> 3035.0400000000004
now i'll just call it a test right

3033.119 --> 3038.079
that's my distinction test not a

3035.04 --> 3041.2
hypothesis test just a test just

3038.079 --> 3044.319
something you do

3041.2 --> 3047.5989999999997
because an observation does not in any

3044.319 --> 3049.04
way observe yeah emphasize anything you

3047.599 --> 3052.0
do

3049.04 --> 3053.92
so i'll just call it a test

3052.0 --> 3056.559
even though qe doesn't approve i don't

3053.92 --> 3056.559
give a [ __ ]

3059.76 --> 3063.28
it's not a science test

3064.319 --> 3069.839
it's just a test but yeah right going

3067.76 --> 3070.96
around the place and

3069.839 --> 3073.92
ooh

3070.96 --> 3076.079
flat earth tests ooh how necessary oh we

3073.92 --> 3078.8
need to go everywhere to make sure that

3076.079 --> 3080.2400000000002
it's also flat there

3078.8 --> 3082.8
what

3080.24 --> 3086.319
come on

3082.8 --> 3089.3590000000004
it is flat everywhere it has to be flat

3086.319 --> 3091.839
everywhere it cannot be anything else

3089.359 --> 3093.5989999999997
like it's

3091.839 --> 3096.4
arriving at the point where there really

3093.599 --> 3098.4
is no no need to even test whether it is

3096.4 --> 3101.2000000000003
flat or not because it all has to be

3098.4 --> 3103.44
flat at this point

3101.2 --> 3104.3999999999996
there's no other way things can have

3103.44 --> 3106.88
been

3104.4 --> 3111.319
yeah can have been arranged

3106.88 --> 3111.319
the layout has to be flat

3116.04 --> 3120.96
observational experiment no

3118.8 --> 3122.88
no it's not an experiment professor phil

3120.96 --> 3125.119
bell

3122.88 --> 3126.88
experiment actually does

3125.119 --> 3131.2000000000003
still fit in

3126.88 --> 3131.2000000000003
to the physics and science

3132.8 --> 3135.599
category

3135.76 --> 3141.599
and yeah it's an observation

3138.4 --> 3141.599
is not an experiment

3142.88 --> 3148.319
it's you're just looking at it

3146.319 --> 3150.24
that's not an experiment you're not very

3148.319 --> 3153.64
manipulating anything

3150.24 --> 3153.64
as an experimenter

3160.0 --> 3164.24
it doesn't matter if you say scientific

3161.92 --> 3167.28
experiment experiment

3164.24 --> 3171.04
does really like where does the word

3167.28 --> 3173.599
even come from it does imply it

3171.04 --> 3175.2
right a test is a test anything can be a

3173.599 --> 3177.6800000000003
test

3175.2 --> 3180.0789999999997
social tests you have school tests

3177.68 --> 3181.68
there's all kinds of tests that no have

3180.079 --> 3183.599
no relation

3181.68 --> 3186.16
to science whatsoever

3183.599 --> 3188.559
but an experiment yeah

3186.16 --> 3192.839
it does

3188.559 --> 3196.4
an experiment is very much tied into

3192.839 --> 3198.16
science the field of science

3196.4 --> 3199.6800000000003
so it doesn't matter if you don't say

3198.16 --> 3201.839
scientific experiment if you're going to

3199.68 --> 3203.359
use the word experiment it does kind of

3201.839 --> 3205.2799999999997
imply that

3203.359 --> 3207.68
yeah it's taking away words you're not

3205.28 --> 3209.92
allowed to use it but in this case there

3207.68 --> 3211.5989999999997
is a good point to that

3209.92 --> 3214.2400000000002
all right i'm not gonna say i'm not

3211.599 --> 3216.48
gonna say test anymore

3214.24 --> 3219.2
because anything can be a test

3216.48 --> 3220.16
i can freaking call it a test if i want

3219.2 --> 3221.2
it

3220.16 --> 3223.1189999999997
nothing

3221.2 --> 3224.7999999999997
like you have no

3223.119 --> 3225.839
judicial

3224.8 --> 3229.52
or

3225.839 --> 3232.0
lingual grounds to stop me doing that

3229.52 --> 3234.64
you can't say that's pseudoscience or

3232.0 --> 3237.119
you're misapplying no you can't do that

3234.64 --> 3239.7599999999998
because you can call anything a test as

3237.119 --> 3242.88
long as something is done

3239.76 --> 3245.76
as long as the consciousness is engaging

3242.88 --> 3247.839
with anything you can call it a test

3245.76 --> 3250.96
experiment not so much

3247.839 --> 3252.72
experiment does imply hypothesis

3250.96 --> 3253.68
which is bound

3252.72 --> 3255.68
to

3253.68 --> 3257.359
well very manipulating a natural

3255.68 --> 3260.72
phenomenon

3257.359 --> 3262.72
which is observation is not you're not

3260.72 --> 3265.72
very manipulating anything by just

3262.72 --> 3265.72
observing

3267.76 --> 3272.6400000000003
in my lecture room okay well yeah that

3270.319 --> 3274.5589999999997
makes you a pseudoscientist

3272.64 --> 3277.5589999999997
but we all know you are professor

3274.559 --> 3277.559
filwell

3279.04 --> 3283.92
right and yeah in your little smurf

3281.2 --> 3286.9199999999996
circles yeah you can smurf it all you

3283.92 --> 3286.92
like

3300.799 --> 3303.799
do

3306.96 --> 3309.44
what the

3312.64 --> 3320.359
a test is used no no that's just one

3316.16 --> 3320.359
application chosen one

3321.119 --> 3325.6800000000003
what the hell since when is a test

3323.119 --> 3327.28
exclusively psychological

3325.68 --> 3330.2799999999997
like dude where are you getting that

3327.28 --> 3330.28
from

3340.559 --> 3344.0
right we got the second part right

3342.4 --> 3346.88
though experiment refers to

3344.0 --> 3346.88
investigation

3346.96 --> 3351.839
in which to well it's a hypothesis test

3352.64 --> 3357.04
investigation not so much it's an

3354.64 --> 3361.64
experiment is the actual testing of the

3357.04 --> 3361.64
hypothesis hypothesis test

3368.0 --> 3371.28
hello stas moretz

3375.119 --> 3378.48
i test

3376.559 --> 3379.2000000000003
right

3378.48 --> 3380.559
now

3379.2 --> 3383.4399999999996
tests are

3380.559 --> 3387.8390000000004
a very broad concept it's it basically

3383.44 --> 3387.839
is just like a conscious interaction

3388.24 --> 3396.1189999999997
in order to realize or achieve or

3392.48 --> 3396.119
figure out something

3407.44 --> 3411.04
phil bell's a troll well youtube to be

3410.16 --> 3413.359
fair

3411.04 --> 3415.839
you're kind of a troll too

3413.359 --> 3418.4
if you're gonna call phil bellatro

3415.839 --> 3421.52
i mean he's just been a pretty decent

3418.4 --> 3425.4
participant here he's not trolling

3421.52 --> 3425.4
he's trying to be honest

3442.0 --> 3447.4
bubbles in space roof

3444.4 --> 3447.4
okay

3455.68 --> 3458.68
what

3464.0 --> 3467.52
no that's not correct english

3468.4 --> 3473.119
professor phil bill nice try it's

3470.64 --> 3476.96
hypothesize and not i puff that you

3473.119 --> 3476.96
can't hypothesis something

3478.96 --> 3483.44
i feel kind of embarrassed as a dutch

3480.96 --> 3486.44
person and having to correct your

3483.44 --> 3486.44
english

3492.42 --> 3495.489
[Music]

3504.72 --> 3510.0
right so we have professor phil bell

3506.559 --> 3512.4
that unfortunately is not scientific

3510.0 --> 3513.92
that falls under chemistry

3512.4 --> 3514.839
because

3513.92 --> 3516.64
you're

3514.839 --> 3519.44
taking

3516.64 --> 3521.52
yeah it's it's a man-made phenomenon

3519.44 --> 3524.16
right

3521.52 --> 3525.359
there's no hydrogen and nitrogen in

3524.16 --> 3529.48
nature

3525.359 --> 3529.48
typically forming ammonia

3530.88 --> 3536.0
so this is like

3532.72 --> 3539.5989999999997
inside of a laboratory

3536.0 --> 3539.599
with man-made devices

3541.359 --> 3544.7599999999998
doing that

3544.96 --> 3548.48
right it's just chemistry it's not

3546.799 --> 3550.079
science

3548.48 --> 3552.16
yeah i know very confusing it's

3550.079 --> 3554.48
chemistry not science but it is what it

3552.16 --> 3556.48
is right chemistry is not

3554.48 --> 3560.319
just science

3556.48 --> 3562.2400000000002
chemistry is just sizing up how do

3560.319 --> 3566.4
this substance how does it respond to

3562.24 --> 3566.3999999999996
that substance etc etc but it's

3568.319 --> 3573.839
i don't think that falls under

3571.04 --> 3573.839
science

3579.52 --> 3587.839
maybe maybe it could be argued if you

3582.64 --> 3587.839
could like find the natural effect of it

3588.72 --> 3591.68
ammonia is found

3590.559 --> 3594.3190000000004
like that

3591.68 --> 3596.0789999999997
right well you'd have to carefully lay

3594.319 --> 3598.0
that out

3596.079 --> 3600.6400000000003
within the hypothesis

3598.0 --> 3604.88
of where you're finding

3600.64 --> 3604.8799999999997
that reaction happening in nature

3605.359 --> 3609.2
and then

3606.64 --> 3611.68
if you've established that indeed there

3609.2 --> 3613.1189999999997
is that effect then you can basically

3611.68 --> 3616.0
reduce it

3613.119 --> 3618.559
to a chemistry setup

3616.0 --> 3620.96
and then prove exactly how it works okay

3618.559 --> 3622.88
if you can actually do that

3620.96 --> 3626.559
then you have a

3622.88 --> 3626.559
valid hypothesis i think

3627.76 --> 3632.0
i'm not

3628.799 --> 3632.0
the expert on that

3632.559 --> 3636.88
but overall when you're performing

3634.559 --> 3639.88
chemistry it kind of just becomes

3636.88 --> 3639.88
chemistry

3655.04 --> 3660.0
huh youtube

3657.119 --> 3662.7200000000003
misspell it fraud or he's just kind of

3660.0 --> 3662.72
dyslectic

3664.4 --> 3668.559
or sloppy

3666.799 --> 3672.079
i wouldn't say just because he

3668.559 --> 3672.079
misspelled something he's fraud

3673.04 --> 3681.04
i mean he's not like in a live class

3676.72 --> 3681.04
page to be a teacher right now

3682.4 --> 3685.76
and yeah just because he's delusional

3684.799 --> 3687.52
baller

3685.76 --> 3691.44
about some things doesn't make him

3687.52 --> 3691.44
automatically a liar about everything

3697.599 --> 3701.6800000000003
yeah thanks professor phil but i know

3700.64 --> 3705.0789999999997
that

3701.68 --> 3705.0789999999997
doesn't matter

3716.88 --> 3720.7200000000003
pay to be here oh you bet it

3719.76 --> 3723.599
right

3720.72 --> 3723.5989999999997
i don't think so

3724.799 --> 3728.799
why why would he be paid to be here

3728.0 --> 3731.44
why

3728.799 --> 3731.44
to do what

3731.76 --> 3739.0
why would somebody pay him to be here

3735.2 --> 3739.0
like think about that

3745.839 --> 3752.319
no stasmaret's that's not science

3749.359 --> 3752.319
that's smurf

3753.2 --> 3757.359
science is a method it's very rigid

3758.24 --> 3762.9599999999996
has to have a naturally occurring

3760.319 --> 3766.0
phenomenon you can't conjure it in a

3762.96 --> 3769.119
man-made device the phenomenon that you

3766.0 --> 3773.359
have to vary and manipulate in order to

3769.119 --> 3773.359
establish the cause of the effect

3773.68 --> 3782.0789999999997
it's very specific it's not just oh

3777.119 --> 3785.2000000000003
it's science we just gathered data and

3782.079 --> 3787.3590000000004
maths and oh sorry no no that's not what

3785.2 --> 3789.1189999999997
it is

3787.359 --> 3790.64
that's smurf

3789.119 --> 3793.599
that's the

3790.64 --> 3797.1189999999997
culture of science it's the colloquial

3793.599 --> 3801.799
science it's the pseudoscience

3797.119 --> 3801.799
it's smurf it's not science

3864.4 --> 3868.079
yeah yeah sorry sound was off indeed

3867.119 --> 3869.76
yep

3868.079 --> 3872.4
right

3869.76 --> 3873.2000000000003
i was just responding

3872.4 --> 3875.359
like

3873.2 --> 3877.2799999999997
he's here to undermine it

3875.359 --> 3879.68
i don't think so he's at best he's here

3877.28 --> 3881.6800000000003
to correct it when a flat earther makes

3879.68 --> 3884.16
a mistake so he can be like oh the flat

3881.68 --> 3885.1189999999997
earther made a technical mistake

3884.16 --> 3887.7599999999998
right

3885.119 --> 3889.839
well i actually kind of welcome that

3887.76 --> 3892.079
but i don't think who the hell is gonna

3889.839 --> 3893.7599999999998
pay him to do that

3892.079 --> 3896.079
why would you do that that's just what

3893.76 --> 3898.48
ballers do

3896.079 --> 3900.48
why would you pay a baller to be a

3898.48 --> 3903.44
baller like that

3900.48 --> 3905.28
seriously think about it

3903.44 --> 3907.359
who would do that why

3905.28 --> 3909.039
what's the point

3907.359 --> 3912.319
like

3909.039 --> 3914.7200000000003
ballers just do what ballers do anyway

3912.319 --> 3918.2799999999997
why would you pay them to do that

3914.72 --> 3918.2799999999997
makes no sense

3940.51 --> 3946.2000000000003
[Music]

3943.2 --> 3946.2
hmm

3960.079 --> 3965.28
because he would normally be playing

3962.079 --> 3968.1600000000003
golf well maybe

3965.28 --> 3969.8390000000004
maybe he just kind of feels lonely

3968.16 --> 3972.48
ever thought about that

3969.839 --> 3974.799
maybe he kind of likes the company i

3972.48 --> 3976.799
think that professor phil bell actually

3974.799 --> 3980.24
just likes the company

3976.799 --> 3981.359
i think he's just kind of a bit lonely

3980.24 --> 3983.7599999999998
really

3981.359 --> 3985.7599999999998
i'm not getting any weird

3983.76 --> 3988.7990000000004
vibes of him like that

3985.76 --> 3991.3590000000004
i mean other than baller responses and

3988.799 --> 3994.4
all that right

3991.359 --> 3996.5589999999997
so no i don't mind him in in my chat at

3994.4 --> 3996.559
all

4000.0 --> 4005.76
but i i really don't do not see this

4004.48 --> 4008.799
idea that

4005.76 --> 4011.039
somebody's paying him to do that

4008.799 --> 4015.119
like literally like this is the mission

4011.039 --> 4018.119
go and go to our wins chat

4015.119 --> 4018.119
what

4032.559 --> 4036.7200000000003
same answers as white with it yeah but

4034.96 --> 4039.119
he's not doing it

4036.72 --> 4039.1189999999997
hello

4040.88 --> 4045.2000000000003
i'm sorry

4042.799 --> 4047.44
is professor phil bell like disrupting

4045.2 --> 4050.3999999999996
my chat right now

4047.44 --> 4054.16
is he preventing the conversation from

4050.4 --> 4056.88
moving on this and that no

4054.16 --> 4056.8799999999997
no he's not

4061.52 --> 4065.72
oh hello by the way john bernard

4078.88 --> 4081.2000000000003
right

4082.799 --> 4087.359
so yeah i don't mind if you guys want to

4084.799 --> 4089.7599999999998
like hammer him for like

4087.359 --> 4091.0389999999998
globe mistakes and all that nonsense of

4089.76 --> 4092.96
course but

4091.039 --> 4094.96
like he's not

4092.96 --> 4096.799
being paid

4094.96 --> 4099.199
the troll that

4096.799 --> 4102.56
i still have not seen any evidence that

4099.199 --> 4104.96
that even exists entirely i think that's

4102.56 --> 4107.759
just like a

4104.96 --> 4110.319
crazy idea

4107.759 --> 4113.44
that arrives from the need

4110.319 --> 4116.400000000001
to see somebody as an enemy

4113.44 --> 4116.4
really it's

4117.12 --> 4122.239
is like combat hunger or something

4119.679 --> 4124.4800000000005
because it makes no sense nobody does

4122.239 --> 4124.48
that

4126.08 --> 4129.44
like

4127.199 --> 4130.639999999999
at best there might be

4129.44 --> 4133.04
bots

4130.64 --> 4135.12
hired or something

4133.04 --> 4137.44
in the chat but you would do that to

4135.12 --> 4139.759
your own chat as you see and then to

4137.44 --> 4142.799
pipe up to seem like oh there's so many

4139.759 --> 4145.6
people in there right that's like

4142.799 --> 4148.0
the closest i can imagine to

4145.6 --> 4152.0
a scenario like that because no who the

4148.0 --> 4154.719
hell is gonna pay a human being to get

4152.0 --> 4157.759
into somebody's chat like that that

4154.719 --> 4161.839
makes no sense that people just do that

4157.759 --> 4165.759
they just do it because they wanna and

4161.839 --> 4168.4
they have the extra time they just do it

4165.759 --> 4172.56
nobody's gonna pay anybody to go to

4168.4 --> 4174.879999999999
somebody's chat it makes no damn sense

4172.56 --> 4177.04
really think about it carefully it makes

4174.88 --> 4179.1990000000005
no sense

4177.04 --> 4181.6
because if they would if if it would

4179.199 --> 4185.5199999999995
actually be a paid action then that

4181.6 --> 4188.96
would stand out enormously they would be

4185.52 --> 4190.799000000001
spending time selling it right because

4188.96 --> 4192.719
they're on the clock they're being paid

4190.799 --> 4195.36
to do something they're not just gonna

4192.719 --> 4197.52
hang around and

4195.36 --> 4198.639999999999
like moderate comments that makes no

4197.52 --> 4201.120000000001
sense

4198.64 --> 4202.56
you're gonna be paid to advertise or

4201.12 --> 4204.719
something or to

4202.56 --> 4206.719
relay a specific message

4204.719 --> 4209.36
then you're going to be spending time

4206.719 --> 4210.64
and energy to get people's attention to

4209.36 --> 4213.12
do that

4210.64 --> 4217.8
he's not doing that so

4213.12 --> 4217.8
nobody's paying him it makes no sense

4223.12 --> 4228.4
just use bots for free right well

4226.08 --> 4231.64
yeah

4228.4 --> 4231.639999999999
it's easier

4254.8 --> 4261.28
youtube i'm getting the feeling like you

4257.76 --> 4261.280000000001
might be paid here to

4261.6 --> 4266.159000000001
to to dig up and route out

4264.48 --> 4268.32
globers

4266.159 --> 4270.799999999999
have you been paid to do that

4268.32 --> 4273.12
you're spending a lot of time

4270.8 --> 4275.92
and energy in my chat right now trying

4273.12 --> 4278.159
to make look professor phil bell look

4275.92 --> 4280.56
like a secret infiltrator or something

4278.159 --> 4281.44
it makes no sense dude

4280.56 --> 4283.1990000000005
you're

4281.44 --> 4287.44
acting more like you're the secret

4283.199 --> 4290.48
infiltrator than he is right now

4287.44 --> 4290.48
might be paid with this

4291.28 --> 4294.28
right

4294.75 --> 4297.92
[Music]

4312.56 --> 4318.52
hahaha

4315.52 --> 4318.52
hmm

4341.6 --> 4347.120000000001
right well youtube yeah i agree like it

4344.48 --> 4348.959999999999
is annoying to be lied to just know the

4347.12 --> 4351.5199999999995
source right

4348.96 --> 4353.84
like professor fibal he's been

4351.52 --> 4355.6
been pretty nice so far in the chat

4353.84 --> 4358.2390000000005
today but you know

4355.6 --> 4361.360000000001
that if you're gonna get very technical

4358.239 --> 4363.36
bring in some very specific flat earth

4361.36 --> 4366.48
proof

4363.36 --> 4368.48
piece of evidence some technique

4366.48 --> 4370.5599999999995
that's when he's gonna pipe up and do

4368.48 --> 4371.44
his thing but that's just what ballers

4370.56 --> 4374.159000000001
do

4371.44 --> 4377.199
he's not being paid to do that it's just

4374.159 --> 4377.199
what a baller does

4377.28 --> 4382.84
it's annoying i get it this i'm sorry

4379.679 --> 4385.679
that's the world that's what it

4382.84 --> 4387.92
is there will be ballers out there that

4385.679 --> 4390.96
will do what ballers do

4387.92 --> 4393.28
nobody's paying them to do that

4390.96 --> 4397.44
although maybe you could say indirectly

4393.28 --> 4397.44
their entire life is probably

4397.76 --> 4403.52
paid for in ways for them to be

4401.04 --> 4406.56
indoctrinated like that but did they

4403.52 --> 4408.56
consciously realize that

4406.56 --> 4410.84
as they underwent it

4408.56 --> 4414.2390000000005
no probably not are they being paid

4410.84 --> 4416.96
afterward to actually consciously spread

4414.239 --> 4420.48
that i don't think so

4416.96 --> 4422.88
right the payment was probably the the

4420.48 --> 4425.04
life they chose

4422.88 --> 4428.32
and the indoctrination

4425.04 --> 4430.4
was the price and they just do that now

4428.32 --> 4432.159
because they believe it because they've

4430.4 --> 4434.08
been

4432.159 --> 4435.679
railroaded like that

4434.08 --> 4439.0
and they're just carrying out what

4435.679 --> 4439.0
they've learned

4449.76 --> 4455.1990000000005
right not everybody here is to convince

4451.92 --> 4458.4
others yeah it starts with yourself

4455.199 --> 4460.159
most of the time when people pike up

4458.4 --> 4462.719
in some kind of

4460.159 --> 4464.4
conflicting argument it's

4462.719 --> 4466.8
first the force most to convince

4464.4 --> 4470.159
themselves to

4466.8 --> 4472.4800000000005
put down what they believe in

4470.159 --> 4475.48
and then defend that

4472.48 --> 4475.48
right

4513.67 --> 4521.08
[Laughter]

4516.4 --> 4521.08
right seeking star wars hello by the way

4530.64 --> 4533.64
hmm

4560.56 --> 4565.2390000000005
right heart mood horse grave

4568.0 --> 4570.88
all right anyway

4575.76 --> 4579.84
[Music]

4577.52 --> 4583.400000000001
let's see if nathan's starting up

4579.84 --> 4583.400000000001
fed yet

4586.8 --> 4589.8
um

4595.679 --> 4598.8
i'm not seeing it yet

4599.76 --> 4605.0
oh well right anyway be back in two

4602.0 --> 4605.0
minutes

4628.64 --> 4631.64
so

4698.4 --> 4701.879999999999
everywhere went

4715.199 --> 4718.199
um

4729.12 --> 4734.599999999999
no harmon i think they're referring to

4731.199 --> 4734.599999999999
rubber digital

4739.66 --> 4742.75
[Applause]

4759.84 --> 4764.4800000000005
i loved yesterday's cat yeah that's yeah

4762.48 --> 4768.4
it's not even my cat it's the neighbor's

4764.48 --> 4768.4
cat but he really likes hang around

4768.719 --> 4772.36
i love that cat

4777.679 --> 4782.679
it's a rasta hat

4779.679 --> 4782.679
god

4792.32 --> 4796.32
it was schroedinger's cat i hope not

4797.28 --> 4802.92
i think schrodinger's cat is such a

4799.04 --> 4802.92
cruel concept

4816.159 --> 4821.5199999999995
it like overall it's cruel why would you

4819.44 --> 4823.5199999999995
lock a cat

4821.52 --> 4825.4400000000005
inside of a

4823.52 --> 4828.080000000001
box like that

4825.44 --> 4830.799999999999
that alone is already cruel and then

4828.08 --> 4833.28
like potentially poisoning it

4830.8 --> 4835.52
i think the whole thing is just really

4833.28 --> 4837.84
evil

4835.52 --> 4841.4800000000005
like was that all really necessary for

4837.84 --> 4841.4800000000005
that experiment

4851.44 --> 4858.879999999999
but yeah the concept will

4854.4 --> 4861.199
always be like stalking our minds

4858.88 --> 4862.96
because yeah i know schrodinger's cat i

4861.199 --> 4865.5199999999995
just when you really think about it it's

4862.96 --> 4867.199
so cruel like

4865.52 --> 4869.679
i don't particularly like this

4867.199 --> 4871.12
schrodinger guy

4869.679 --> 4873.28
sounds like he's

4871.12 --> 4876.4
very abusive towards animals he doesn't

4873.28 --> 4876.4
have a lot of empathy

4885.04 --> 4888.44
i'm not muted

4892.32 --> 4899.44
what are you talking about jeff

4894.96 --> 4899.44
hey that fellow thanks for the 99 cents

4899.84 --> 4904.0
it was only a thought experiment oh

4901.84 --> 4904.96
really he didn't actually physically do

4904.0 --> 4906.8
it

4904.96 --> 4908.8
okay

4906.8 --> 4909.6
are you sure

4908.8 --> 4912.08
so

4909.6 --> 4916.400000000001
then it's not even an experiment it's

4912.08 --> 4919.5199999999995
not even i'm not muted jeff

4916.4 --> 4923.799999999999
sounds coming through right here

4919.52 --> 4923.8
i think you're on deafening

4934.239 --> 4938.239
a thought experiment okay well in that

4936.239 --> 4940.879999999999
case then schrodinger's

4938.239 --> 4941.919999999999
okay i guess

4940.88 --> 4945.84
although

4941.92 --> 4945.84
it's kind of silly though that

4946.159 --> 4950.239
not testing it

4948.159 --> 4953.5199999999995
that doesn't really make it scientific

4950.239 --> 4957.04
it's just a conception then

4953.52 --> 4960.84
no cats were harmed okay good

4957.04 --> 4960.84
i thought that he would

4973.55 --> 4976.7390000000005
[Music]

4978.88 --> 4981.88
do

4986.46 --> 4989.68
[Music]

4998.239 --> 5002.159
cat in a box was my association

5002.239 --> 5008.638999999999
right but it was an open box

5004.719 --> 5011.679
and like that's actually like my

5008.639 --> 5013.84
my sock box so

5011.679 --> 5016.88
like he likes he for some reason he

5013.84 --> 5016.88
likes to sit in there

5017.28 --> 5022.4
but yeah then i get hair all over my

5019.28 --> 5024.239
socks so i have to like then i put a

5022.4 --> 5029.08
a blanket

5024.239 --> 5029.08
like over it so it just sits on that

5030.48 --> 5034.32
because i don't want to get cat hairs

5032.48 --> 5037.32
all over my socks that's like super

5034.32 --> 5037.32
annoying

5044.88 --> 5048.88
absurdity of quantum physics one part

5047.52 --> 5050.88
yeah but

5048.88 --> 5052.32
professor phil bell it's interesting you

5050.88 --> 5054.159000000001
bring it up

5052.32 --> 5056.0
particle being in one more

5054.159 --> 5059.04
one place at the same more than one

5056.0 --> 5060.719
place at the same time yeah

5059.04 --> 5065.04
that's not real

5060.719 --> 5066.96
as in that's purely conceptual

5065.04 --> 5068.88
never real

5066.96 --> 5071.679
there's no

5068.88 --> 5074.32
way you could ever demonstrate that to

5071.679 --> 5076.56
actually be real

5074.32 --> 5078.159
and i think i even know where it's

5076.56 --> 5080.400000000001
coming from

5078.159 --> 5081.92
a particle being in one more than one

5080.4 --> 5083.12
place in the same you know where that

5081.92 --> 5085.679
all comes from

5083.12 --> 5086.5599999999995
from the misconception of the nature of

5085.679 --> 5088.8
light

5086.56 --> 5091.4400000000005
because light was reduced to a particle

5088.8 --> 5093.360000000001
and then endlessly subjected

5091.44 --> 5095.12
to mathematical

5093.36 --> 5098.08
lattices

5095.12 --> 5100.0
literally like frameworks of what it is

5098.08 --> 5101.28
as a particle

5100.0 --> 5103.44
which it isn't

5101.28 --> 5105.599999999999
it's not a wave it is not a particle

5103.44 --> 5107.919999999999
either it's infinite it's infinitely

5105.6 --> 5111.1990000000005
divisible

5107.92 --> 5114.96
there is no minimum size and that

5111.199 --> 5117.839999999999
like is immediately upon realization of

5114.96 --> 5120.719
that fact that it's not a minimum size

5117.84 --> 5121.679
it's not like matter

5120.719 --> 5124.4
yeah

5121.679 --> 5126.88
then all of those crazy crazy

5124.4 --> 5129.799999999999
conceptions oh particle being at two

5126.88 --> 5132.2390000000005
places at the same time an old

5129.8 --> 5134.8
redistribution pattern how can that be

5132.239 --> 5136.879999999999
with particle yeah because it's not a

5134.8 --> 5138.88
particle

5136.88 --> 5141.52
that's why that's where it all comes

5138.88 --> 5143.679
from all that nonsense

5141.52 --> 5145.280000000001
it's because of the misassumption of the

5143.679 --> 5148.32
nature of light

5145.28 --> 5151.199
oh but oh light can do all these things

5148.32 --> 5154.32
even though it's a particle yeah no it's

5151.199 --> 5157.12
not a particle

5154.32 --> 5158.88
it can't do all these things

5157.12 --> 5161.92
being a particle

5158.88 --> 5165.12
that's where the mathematical lattice

5161.92 --> 5167.04
quantum mechanics nonsense comes in and

5165.12 --> 5169.199
then draws all these science fiction

5167.04 --> 5171.679
conclusions about things being at two

5169.199 --> 5174.719
places at the same time yeah or it's

5171.679 --> 5177.1990000000005
just not a particle

5174.719 --> 5180.719
done all of that

5177.199 --> 5180.719
right in the paper bin

5181.199 --> 5186.5599999999995
that's what i think is really going on

5183.76 --> 5189.12
it's been my suspicion for a very long

5186.56 --> 5191.92
time and there's been entire

5189.12 --> 5193.84
science fiction

5191.92 --> 5196.639
traditions

5193.84 --> 5199.1990000000005
being based on the misassumption of

5196.639 --> 5201.36
light being a particle and then quantum

5199.199 --> 5203.28
mechanics responding to that that's what

5201.36 --> 5205.44
i think's been going on in the last

5203.28 --> 5207.759999999999
eight years

5205.44 --> 5210.159
something like that

5207.76 --> 5212.2390000000005
right

5210.159 --> 5213.5199999999995
and i'm on to something with this

5212.239 --> 5216.0
because

5213.52 --> 5219.280000000001
all those things it's all nonsense it's

5216.0 --> 5222.08
all science fiction techno babble based

5219.28 --> 5224.48
on the misassumption that light has a is

5222.08 --> 5226.96
a minimum sized unit

5224.48 --> 5229.36
and yet cannot do all these things

5226.96 --> 5232.639
despite being the minimum size unit yeah

5229.36 --> 5234.5599999999995
or it's just not that minimum size unit

5232.639 --> 5237.56
and that's why it can do all these

5234.56 --> 5237.56
things

5238.56 --> 5241.76
right it's really

5240.56 --> 5245.76
a very

5241.76 --> 5248.159000000001
disappointing quick solution to a giant

5245.76 --> 5250.88
squirt fest of

5248.159 --> 5253.839999999999
of futurist

5250.88 --> 5253.84
mathematics

5257.44 --> 5261.678999999999
it's not a particle that's right it's

5259.44 --> 5263.28
not a wave either the particle wave

5261.679 --> 5264.4800000000005
duality

5263.28 --> 5268.08
is like

5264.48 --> 5270.08
the ball earth flat earth disc false

5268.08 --> 5271.92
dichotomy that's the particle wave

5270.08 --> 5275.96
duality it's neither

5271.92 --> 5275.96
neither is what it is

5283.44 --> 5288.96
it's about where an electron is around a

5286.159 --> 5291.12
proton at any given time

5288.96 --> 5294.88
yeah but it isn't

5291.12 --> 5299.36
again that's doing the same thing

5294.88 --> 5301.84
it has to be a unit and it's flying or

5299.36 --> 5303.759999999999
it's literally a field that is

5301.84 --> 5306.08
everywhere at the same time it's not in

5303.76 --> 5309.84
a specific place

5306.08 --> 5311.199
until it taps out

5309.84 --> 5313.84
until it

5311.199 --> 5314.719
relinquishes

5313.84 --> 5317.12
it

5314.719 --> 5319.44
being a field

5317.12 --> 5319.44
yeah

5319.52 --> 5322.88
again

5320.639 --> 5324.56
it's always the same thing it's always

5322.88 --> 5328.4800000000005
particlism

5324.56 --> 5328.4800000000005
right the quantum mechanics

5328.56 --> 5333.1990000000005
do the particles being at the same time

5330.639 --> 5334.88
it's particlism all of it is because of

5333.199 --> 5338.48
particle theory

5334.88 --> 5340.2390000000005
and constantly the need to always reduce

5338.48 --> 5343.199
whatever you're dealing with down to

5340.239 --> 5345.36
this little freaking ball it has to be

5343.199 --> 5347.678999999999
in a place in time

5345.36 --> 5351.239
right that is what that is

5347.679 --> 5351.2390000000005
it's all nonsense

5352.639 --> 5357.92
it's just mathematical squirting

5355.76 --> 5359.6
based on presuppositions that cannot be

5357.92 --> 5364.04
let go

5359.6 --> 5364.04
you can't you can't let it go

5364.88 --> 5369.76
an electron is not flying around a

5368.56 --> 5372.2390000000005
proton

5369.76 --> 5375.12
it's just a field it's

5372.239 --> 5377.28
it's just there bang it's a charge it's

5375.12 --> 5379.84
a field it's just surrounding it that's

5377.28 --> 5381.599999999999
why it is

5379.84 --> 5384.96
a unit that's why

5381.6 --> 5384.96
matter is a particle

5390.4 --> 5395.36
because there's a minimum size

5393.199 --> 5398.48
there's a minimum size for it to be the

5395.36 --> 5400.159
way it is that's what makes it matter

5398.48 --> 5401.599999999999
because it does have a minimum size

5400.159 --> 5404.96
unlike light

5401.6 --> 5406.159000000001
which can be split up indefinitely

5404.96 --> 5409.199
right but you're always going to be

5406.159 --> 5411.04
bound by matter in order to register the

5409.199 --> 5413.44
light

5411.04 --> 5416.32
right so that's an existential problem

5413.44 --> 5418.839999999999
that is not easily overcome

5416.32 --> 5421.84
can be tested though

5418.84 --> 5423.84
and still working on that

5421.84 --> 5426.8
in the background i'm not like building

5423.84 --> 5426.8
a laboratory but

5427.36 --> 5432.32
like father of a stolen child has hey

5430.08 --> 5433.36
ooh nathan is live it's gonna be live

5432.32 --> 5435.5199999999995
cool

5433.36 --> 5437.36
there's a google panel

5435.52 --> 5440.400000000001
but yeah

5437.36 --> 5443.04
i've devised a test

5440.4 --> 5446.239
in order to figure out whether

5443.04 --> 5447.36
my conception of light has any validity

5446.239 --> 5451.199
and i'm

5447.36 --> 5455.12
yeah well because i'm just a guy

5451.199 --> 5457.759999999999
in a room somewhere without engineering

5455.12 --> 5459.84
degrees or access to a laboratory or a

5457.76 --> 5462.2390000000005
lot of funds there's nothing really i

5459.84 --> 5465.12
can do but theorize but i am waiting for

5462.239 --> 5467.04
people to test my conception

5465.12 --> 5468.96
and that is

5467.04 --> 5470.239
can you prove

5468.96 --> 5472.0
that light

5470.239 --> 5473.599999999999
is

5472.0 --> 5476.4
still

5473.6 --> 5479.120000000001
transferable

5476.4 --> 5480.159
when it's less than a photon

5479.12 --> 5481.76
yeah

5480.159 --> 5484.799999999999
how do you do that

5481.76 --> 5487.12
by outputting the unit yeah the systems

5484.8 --> 5488.2390000000005
i think it's called argon lasers

5487.12 --> 5490.719
that

5488.239 --> 5492.959999999999
give out

5490.719 --> 5495.04
electrons right for the tests that are

5492.96 --> 5496.56
typically used involved in that quantum

5495.04 --> 5499.199
mechanics

5496.56 --> 5501.1990000000005
but instead of firing off a single

5499.199 --> 5502.48
photons worth of

5501.199 --> 5505.28
light energy

5502.48 --> 5507.199
why not fire off half

5505.28 --> 5510.08
or three quarters

5507.199 --> 5513.12
or two thirds

5510.08 --> 5516.0
right so that a single hit will not

5513.12 --> 5517.12
register it will just not register it it

5516.0 --> 5518.48
will hit

5517.12 --> 5519.36
no response

5518.48 --> 5523.28
right

5519.36 --> 5526.32
then you take two of those

5523.28 --> 5529.04
you aim them at exactly

5526.32 --> 5531.599999999999
like absolute perfection that center one

5529.04 --> 5534.719
spot on the photosensitive plate

5531.6 --> 5536.400000000001
and then you fire both of them

5534.719 --> 5538.56
will it register

5536.4 --> 5541.5199999999995
or will it not

5538.56 --> 5543.84
and the outcome of that i guess i could

5541.52 --> 5545.040000000001
call it an experiment would reveal

5543.84 --> 5547.1990000000005
everything

5545.04 --> 5551.04
everything

5547.199 --> 5552.08
because i suspect that if you fire two

5551.04 --> 5555.28
half

5552.08 --> 5558.08
a photon worths of energy

5555.28 --> 5562.08
to a singular spot that it will register

5558.08 --> 5564.32
as a single photon right even though

5562.08 --> 5567.28
two half photons

5564.32 --> 5567.28
were being fired

5567.52 --> 5571.679
right

5569.04 --> 5573.6
and if that can actually be done

5571.679 --> 5575.4400000000005
and john

5573.6 --> 5577.360000000001
father of stone child seem to be very

5575.44 --> 5580.04
enthusiastic about it if that can be

5577.36 --> 5583.759999999999
done it will literally

5580.04 --> 5586.159
completely upheaval the entire physics

5583.76 --> 5588.88
community everything like everything in

5586.159 --> 5590.879999999999
the last 80 years will be like giant box

5588.88 --> 5593.28
of legos oh you built it all it's all

5590.88 --> 5596.2390000000005
worked out perfectly

5593.28 --> 5599.36
crash splat

5596.239 --> 5600.959999999999
start over again everything was wrong

5599.36 --> 5604.239
everything was wrong yeah that's what

5600.96 --> 5604.2390000000005
i'm planning to do here

5604.88 --> 5609.76
two photons kick off two electrons no

5607.76 --> 5611.12
professor you weren't listening you

5609.76 --> 5613.1990000000005
weren't listening

5611.12 --> 5614.639
half a photon

5613.199 --> 5615.678999999999
you fire off

5614.639 --> 5618.400000000001
half

5615.679 --> 5622.4800000000005
a photon

5618.4 --> 5625.679
or two thirds photon energy

5622.48 --> 5627.5199999999995
to ensure that a single firing will not

5625.679 --> 5628.719
register

5627.52 --> 5631.84
but will

5628.719 --> 5634.32
two of those fired off simultaneously on

5631.84 --> 5636.08
exactly the same spot

5634.32 --> 5638.08
will that register

5636.08 --> 5641.44
now then

5638.08 --> 5644.0
you have a new paradigm shift

5641.44 --> 5646.5599999999995
it's gonna absolutely revolutionize the

5644.0 --> 5648.719
entire physics world

5646.56 --> 5650.4800000000005
like

5648.719 --> 5652.639
yeah

5650.48 --> 5655.919999999999
it's probably gonna reveal that they

5652.639 --> 5657.84
knew that and they hid it anyway

5655.92 --> 5659.6
yeah because i think that they knew i

5657.84 --> 5661.76
think that people like feynman and all

5659.6 --> 5664.639
these other people that did all this

5661.76 --> 5667.360000000001
i think they knew i think they knew it

5664.639 --> 5669.76
and they did it anyway

5667.36 --> 5673.04
maybe they were ordered

5669.76 --> 5675.04
maybe they were ordered to say a photon

5673.04 --> 5677.12
is a minimum unit it doesn't exist

5675.04 --> 5680.56
beyond that

5677.12 --> 5683.28
i can devise a test to figure out

5680.56 --> 5684.56
that it might not be that

5683.28 --> 5687.36
i have

5684.56 --> 5689.6
somebody might actually be performing it

5687.36 --> 5691.44
it could revolutionize the entire world

5689.6 --> 5693.92
of physics

5691.44 --> 5696.4
right and that's not just oh i'm so

5693.92 --> 5699.6
special i'm gonna no it actually

5696.4 --> 5701.679
completely revolutionize it

5699.6 --> 5703.4400000000005
as in yeah all that [ __ ]

5701.679 --> 5705.92
you were taught in the last 80 years

5703.44 --> 5707.919999999999
yeah it's all wrong

5705.92 --> 5709.52
it doesn't apply anymore it's all based

5707.92 --> 5712.96
on misassumptions

5709.52 --> 5715.119000000001
all based on mathematical squirting

5712.96 --> 5718.88
based on the misassumption yeah

5715.119 --> 5718.88
i'm looking forward to that happening

5719.199 --> 5725.28
and i'm probably going to be very hated

5721.679 --> 5727.119
by a whole bunch of people in physics

5725.28 --> 5731.44
that have made it their business to

5727.119 --> 5731.44
learn all that [ __ ] by heart

5733.6 --> 5737.92
right and that might include quantum

5735.92 --> 5739.6
eraser because i'm pretty sure he's one

5737.92 --> 5742.6
of those guys that learned it all by

5739.6 --> 5742.6
heart

5753.119 --> 5761.599999999999
how do you get half a photon

5756.88 --> 5764.32
well powering up the argon laser less

5761.6 --> 5765.52
right there's a slider in it it's not

5764.32 --> 5768.48
just oh

5765.52 --> 5771.52
photon that's the minimum setting no

5768.48 --> 5774.239
it's an infinite slider as far as i know

5771.52 --> 5777.679
it's just how much energy total how much

5774.239 --> 5780.638999999999
energy total then oh this is

5777.679 --> 5782.719
roughly a photon right

5780.639 --> 5785.6
fire it off yeah register of a single

5782.719 --> 5788.639
photon okay now let's put the sliders

5785.6 --> 5789.52
down some more

5788.639 --> 5791.6
right

5789.52 --> 5793.76
so it's not gonna register as a single

5791.6 --> 5796.88
photon

5793.76 --> 5798.719
and then take two of those machines

5796.88 --> 5800.8
exactly the same setting

5798.719 --> 5803.119
aim them at the same spot

5800.8 --> 5805.52
will it register a photon

5803.119 --> 5808.88
that's my test

5805.52 --> 5812.56
that is my test

5808.88 --> 5814.88
see how absurdly simple it really is

5812.56 --> 5818.0
when you think about it

5814.88 --> 5820.96
it's always been there it's been hidden

5818.0 --> 5823.96
this information has been withheld from

5820.96 --> 5823.96
us

5826.8 --> 5832.2390000000005
it's a trap it was always a trap it's

5829.28 --> 5836.44
put in there and endless mathematical

5832.239 --> 5836.44
garbage has come out of it

5842.639 --> 5844.96
all right

5852.8 --> 5856.88
so yeah i'm really looking forward to

5855.04 --> 5858.0
one day

5856.88 --> 5860.400000000001
hearing

5858.0 --> 5863.04
that i turn out to be right about this

5860.4 --> 5865.28
because this thing

5863.04 --> 5866.96
this concept about light infinitely

5865.28 --> 5869.679
divisible beams

5866.96 --> 5871.52
that's not like something i i just dug

5869.679 --> 5875.52
up now that's something i actually

5871.52 --> 5875.52
thought up when i was 12.

5875.679 --> 5880.56
it had barely

5877.36 --> 5882.719
it was pure intuition pure intuition

5880.56 --> 5886.4800000000005
that i figured it out because i

5882.719 --> 5889.36
did not figure out the math

5886.48 --> 5891.199
right i was never really that good at it

5889.36 --> 5894.4
but i knew back then like this is

5891.199 --> 5895.759999999999
incorrect it's like assumption and all

5894.4 --> 5898.08
the [ __ ]

5895.76 --> 5900.4800000000005
that's come out of the assumption

5898.08 --> 5902.239
it's all wrong i knew it when i was 12

5900.48 --> 5904.638999999999
guys

5902.239 --> 5905.5199999999995
it's been there it's been sitting there

5904.639 --> 5907.679
for

5905.52 --> 5910.320000000001
30 years

5907.679 --> 5913.56
in the back of my mind 30 years it's 30

5910.32 --> 5913.5599999999995
years ago

5930.32 --> 5936.239
you'll get one photon with less energy

5934.0 --> 5938.239
a little less energy

5936.239 --> 5940.5599999999995
what the hell that doesn't make any

5938.239 --> 5940.5599999999995
sense

5947.36 --> 5952.08
what you just said is self-contradicting

5949.84 --> 5954.719
you get one photon with less energy but

5952.08 --> 5957.04
it is still a single photon

5954.719 --> 5958.639
well maybe you have to redefine what a

5957.04 --> 5961.679
photon is then

5958.639 --> 5964.2390000000005
because how can it be only one photon

5961.679 --> 5966.32
unless had less with less energy that

5964.239 --> 5970.638999999999
makes no sense either it's a photon or

5966.32 --> 5970.639
it isn't is it a unit or isn't it

5977.6 --> 5981.119000000001
and have you literally done that

5980.0 --> 5983.52
professor

5981.119 --> 5987.04
did you really do that or are you or are

5983.52 --> 5988.96
you lying did you do my setup two argon

5987.04 --> 5991.36
lasers half a worth of

5988.96 --> 5993.119
photon energy

5991.36 --> 5996.239
fired at the sa at the same point did

5993.119 --> 5996.239
you actually do that

6005.52 --> 6010.639
because i don't believe that i i don't

6008.159 --> 6013.36
believe you have like if you've actually

6010.639 --> 6016.2390000000005
done that then why would you

6013.36 --> 6017.04
it's a packet of energy

6016.239 --> 6019.04
so

6017.04 --> 6022.84
it's not a unit then

6019.04 --> 6022.84
you agree with me

6024.08 --> 6027.199
but can you prove it

6029.119 --> 6032.96
not just argon okay

6035.199 --> 6039.599999999999
well dude maybe get in contact then with

6037.6 --> 6042.719
the father of a stolen child

6039.6 --> 6042.719
maybe you can help him out

6044.0 --> 6050.32
so would you then agree with my

6046.8 --> 6052.8
idea that light is infinitely divisible

6050.32 --> 6052.799999999999
beams

6052.96 --> 6058.0
it's not a unit

6055.28 --> 6061.8
it's just been classified a unit it

6058.0 --> 6061.8
isn't a unit though

6077.76 --> 6081.1990000000005
anyway i'm rounding out the show

6081.92 --> 6085.36
but yeah

6083.36 --> 6086.88
i want to hear more about that professor

6085.36 --> 6089.199
phil bell

6086.88 --> 6093.1990000000005
if you could contact me on skype

6089.199 --> 6096.08
could discuss this that would be great

6093.199 --> 6098.638999999999
because like best concept is well almost

6096.08 --> 6101.84
literally in a way my life's work

6098.639 --> 6101.84
theoretical that is

6104.639 --> 6109.04
no way of knowing that with the what

6110.159 --> 6113.92
so did you perform

6112.32 --> 6118.08
the physical

6113.92 --> 6118.08
execution of the test or didn't

6118.84 --> 6123.1990000000005
you you're starting to

6121.44 --> 6126.159
sound a little contradicting here

6123.199 --> 6126.159
professor phil bell

6127.119 --> 6131.759999999999
right anyway i am rounding out the show

6129.199 --> 6133.759999999999
so thanks everyone for coming i hope you

6131.76 --> 6134.400000000001
like this show i thought it was pretty

6133.76 --> 6135.92
good

6134.4 --> 6138.4
started out a bit slow but it got

6135.92 --> 6140.719
interesting

6138.4 --> 6142.879999999999
if you liked it then please don't forget

6140.719 --> 6144.639
to rogan's it up and if you haven't

6142.88 --> 6146.719

6146.719 --> 6151.199
i'm going live which is normally 1 pm

6149.199 --> 6153.36
amsterdam time and weekdays and 2 p.m

6151.199 --> 6155.599999999999
amsterdam time in the weekend and please

6153.36 --> 6157.44
also do support me through the paypal

6155.6 --> 6159.6

6157.44 --> 6161.28
membership system join button that will

6159.6 --> 6163.92
be much appreciated

6161.28 --> 6167.199
you can still use it

6163.92 --> 6169.119
so please keep it coming if you can

6167.199 --> 6172.239
right i'll be back tomorrow flat earth

6169.119 --> 6174.159
early bird number 1150 on a tuesday and

6172.239 --> 6176.08
i'm going to join the flat earth debates

6174.159 --> 6178.5599999999995
which should have already started up

6176.08 --> 6181.04
hope to see you all there in chat

6178.56 --> 6184.370000000001
and until the next video

6181.04 --> 6200.639
keep it flat

6184.37 --> 6203.2699999999995
