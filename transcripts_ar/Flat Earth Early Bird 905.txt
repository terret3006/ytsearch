welcome to flat earth early bird number

48.92 --> 52.399
905

50.079 --> 54.0
i'm your host arwyn and before we start

and membership system join button

74.24 --> 79.91999999999999
that'll be much appreciated

77.68 --> 79.92
so

85.119 --> 91.68
the weather today is kind of the same as

89.04 --> 91.68
yesterday

92.0 --> 95.6
maybe a little less stormy a little more

94.32 --> 98.0
less moist

95.6 --> 101.439
still some big cloud bags out there as

98.0 --> 105.28
you can see

101.439 --> 105.27999999999999
also a couple of clear spots

110.799 --> 116.71900000000001
there's several layers of cloud

114.88 --> 120.399
and one's really low to the ground see

116.719 --> 123.03999999999999
yeah well they're moving quite fast

120.399 --> 124.0
in relation to the ones much further up

123.04 --> 126.84
there

124.0 --> 128.16
maybe you can even see the shifting of

126.84 --> 131.52
it

128.16 --> 133.92
i can with my naked eye

131.52 --> 134.72
the webcam may have a little bit trouble

133.92 --> 137.51999999999998
with that

134.72 --> 137.52
picking that up

140.959 --> 147.2
all right anyway it's still

144.16 --> 156.16
pretty nice and it's

147.2 --> 160.48
yeah plenty warm

156.16 --> 165.28
right so it's wednesday the

160.48 --> 165.28
26th of may 2021

167.599 --> 173.04
starting a little late because i had a

169.92 --> 173.04
very late night again

178.56 --> 185.84
and so i got up a little late

181.68 --> 185.84
very good sleep though

188.8 --> 195.68
yesterday's show was really cool was

192.319 --> 195.67999999999998
went very well i thought

196.239 --> 200.239
and if yeah the flat earth debates as

198.48 --> 203.84
well

200.239 --> 206.879
i did a whole globe win tour

203.84 --> 211.04
thing and

206.879 --> 211.04
yeah later on also kiwi live

211.44 --> 216.319
and i did a bit of the same or at least

213.68 --> 216.31900000000002
i tried

223.2 --> 227.83999999999997
let me quickly draft the notes

232.159 --> 235.439
all right also i had been wondering like

234.72 --> 237.439
hey what

235.439 --> 241.84
when is own benjamin gonna go live again

237.439 --> 241.84
but it seems like

242.64 --> 247.2
tea time with barry and larry has also

245.28 --> 250.4
been deleted

247.2 --> 252.83999999999997
so don't know exactly when that happened

250.4 --> 254.959
but yeah i noticed that yesterday so

252.84 --> 259.359
yeah it keeps on happening

254.959 --> 264.479
very annoying to find

259.359 --> 269.84
hope he starts a new

264.479 --> 269.84
tea time account somewhere

275.84 --> 283.84
you where is everybody

285.28 --> 294.08
all right also just noticed that nathan

289.36 --> 294.08000000000004
did a little video about a new gofundme

294.88 --> 301.039
because his car broke down

297.919 --> 306.08
pretty badly i think so yeah

301.039 --> 309.039
go and help him out on his gofundme page

306.08 --> 311.59999999999997
to get his car repaired shout out to

309.039 --> 313.919
nathan oakley

311.6 --> 313.91900000000004
uh

314.639 --> 325.84000000000003
let's see

326.32 --> 329.84
all right yeah listen to a bit of

328.8 --> 332.96000000000004
brandon's

329.84 --> 335.039
in the background though didn't even get

332.96 --> 336.88
on the chat was playing a game and took

335.039 --> 338.88
way too long for that freaking game

336.88 --> 342.24
again

338.88 --> 344.8
and that's why he came so late

342.24 --> 346.32
but like even rumpus was on there and

344.8 --> 349.68
rumpus was

346.32 --> 351.479
nuttier than usual that's what really

349.68 --> 355.44
stood out to me like he got a little

351.479 --> 357.44
megalomaniacal there that was very weird

355.44 --> 359.36
to hear him like that it it's like

357.44 --> 361.919
almost out of character

359.36 --> 362.47900000000004
don't know if anybody picked up on that

361.919 --> 365.75899999999996
that was

362.479 --> 369.52
like really weird

365.759 --> 372.0
brandon's get pretty rowdy at times

369.52 --> 373.52
but to see rompus just fall out of

372.0 --> 375.759
character like that that was kind of

373.52 --> 378.56
weird

375.759 --> 380.88
so maybe he is losing cohesion after

378.56 --> 384.319
such a long time maybe

380.88 --> 387.12
it's really getting to him

384.319 --> 387.84000000000003
i wonder what will happen next anyway

387.12 --> 393.36
where is

387.84 --> 393.35999999999996
everybody there's eight watching

393.44 --> 397.199
supposedly says youtube

401.28 --> 407.59999999999997
hey what the

405.039 --> 408.96
okay i had to reload to see somebody

407.6 --> 411.44
commenting in there that is

408.96 --> 414.08
weird right hello amanda young good

411.44 --> 414.08
morning to you

421.52 --> 437.84
how are you doing lady

451.28 --> 454.4
all right this time frame is probably

452.8 --> 455.91900000000004
going to be like

454.4 --> 458.63899999999995
at this time there's going to be a whole

455.919 --> 460.71999999999997
bunch of people

458.639 --> 462.24
that still go to school that probably

460.72 --> 465.52000000000004
are getting

462.24 --> 468.639
to their last few weeks now

465.52 --> 469.19899999999996
so everybody's probably or a whole bunch

468.639 --> 472.319
of people

469.199 --> 474.479
especially younger ones are like looking

472.319 --> 476.319
forward to finally having some serious

474.479 --> 478.87899999999996
down time

476.319 --> 481.84000000000003
in summer vacation and maybe a couple of

478.879 --> 483.68
working people as well

481.84 --> 485.19899999999996
maybe that's why everybody's so late in

483.68 --> 488.08
chat

485.199 --> 490.639
hey hello steamy traveler watching the

488.08 --> 494.56
total lunar eclipse right now

490.639 --> 498.319
oh really there it is

494.56 --> 498.72
hmm oh yeah you can't see the moon over

498.319 --> 500.96000000000004
here

498.72 --> 500.96000000000004
so

502.56 --> 507.759
but there was a really bright full moon

504.8 --> 511.199
yesterday night that did stood out to me

507.759 --> 514.24
stand out to me like it was seemed like

511.199 --> 517.039
it seemed bigger

514.24 --> 517.76
sometimes yeah called a super moon and

517.039 --> 520.08
then it just

517.76 --> 523.68
seems bigger of course it has no literal

520.08 --> 527.76
size it's a holographic effect

523.68 --> 529.1999999999999
but maybe instead of saying it seems

527.76 --> 532.8389999999999
bigger

529.2 --> 534.1600000000001
it could rather be explained as it seems

532.839 --> 537.839
closer

534.16 --> 542.0
like it's the hologram effect just

537.839 --> 542.0
seems like it's closer up

543.76 --> 549.8389999999999
live shot ah okay i'll take a look at

547.04 --> 549.8389999999999
that

551.68 --> 558.0
all right oh it really is happening

555.519 --> 558.0
right now

560.839 --> 563.839
huh

574.839 --> 577.839
hmm

588.839 --> 591.839
um

602.24 --> 607.839
right so i guess that is entertaining

606.24 --> 619.839
people right now

607.839 --> 619.839
looking at how weird it looks

630.839 --> 633.839
hmm

638.079 --> 642.56
right yeah the link you said it seems to

639.92 --> 642.56
be like a

642.64 --> 648.56
repeating slide or something

646.72 --> 650.72
a lot of people in chat there say it's

648.56 --> 654.2399999999999
already over

650.72 --> 654.24
but anyway

654.959 --> 658.3199999999999
so what are you guys up to

659.36 --> 663.6
did you watch your listen to qe live

664.16 --> 668.64
it was kind of a all over the place show

668.959 --> 675.8389999999999
but it was a lot of fun to be part of

670.959 --> 675.8389999999999
the panel there

686.839 --> 689.839
hmm

715.6 --> 721.36
hmm yeah people in chat over there are

717.76 --> 721.36
saying it's a partial eclipse

728.839 --> 731.839
anyway

734.72 --> 745.839
what would you guys gals like me to talk

737.68 --> 745.8389999999999
about today

746.399 --> 753.2
do i think k2 is causing this eclipse

750.639 --> 756.48
right routes for the song k2 is for the

753.2 --> 756.48
moon was that the idea

756.639 --> 760.88
all right well it's basically only a

760.16 --> 764.399
model

760.88 --> 767.68
there it 306 because whatever

764.399 --> 769.839
is causing these eclipses

767.68 --> 772.079
just like the celestials themselves it's

769.839 --> 775.7600000000001
not a physical object literally

772.079 --> 777.68
out there but it's part of

775.76 --> 780.399
well a model and that could apply

777.68 --> 782.56
holographically

780.399 --> 782.56
so

784.48 --> 791.12
like is it an object or is the light

788.56 --> 792.2399999999999
being cancelled out in another fashion

791.12 --> 794.48
yeah that's the question

792.24 --> 794.48
right

796.16 --> 800.8
still yeah since they yeah all the

798.959 --> 804.88
celestial seems to be holographic

800.8 --> 806.88
it's kind of tough pinpointing it

804.88 --> 808.959
you know like how does this work we

806.88 --> 812.079
don't really know how it all manifests

808.959 --> 814.3199999999999
so we don't know that then we don't

812.079 --> 818.959
exactly know whether things

814.32 --> 821.0400000000001
are even blocked or negated

818.959 --> 822.3199999999999
but yeah when they've modeled it even

821.04 --> 826.399
the ancients they

822.32 --> 829.9200000000001
conjured forth rahu and ketu

826.399 --> 834.399
as a virtual invisible dark body

829.92 --> 834.399
that would block these two celestials

838.8 --> 843.8389999999999
hello by the way tara 306 good to see

840.959 --> 843.8389999999999
you in chat

860.639 --> 867.44
how do they predict so accurately

863.92 --> 868.8389999999999
well it's because of the trajectories of

867.44 --> 871.6800000000001
all the

868.839 --> 875.839
celestials and i guess in that sense

871.68 --> 875.8389999999999
we're okay to have a trajectory as well

878.079 --> 885.5999999999999
like yeah it's all cyclical so based on

882.639 --> 886.0
how the sick the cycles have been built

885.6 --> 890.32
up

886.0 --> 892.16
over the ages you can deduce

890.32 --> 894.1600000000001
and therefore predict where they're

892.16 --> 896.639
going

894.16 --> 899.76
and that's what basically the ancient

896.639 --> 902.8
sky clock star map

899.76 --> 904.48
prediction system was based on because

902.8 --> 906.8
of the cyclical nature of all the

904.48 --> 913.839
motions

906.8 --> 913.8389999999999
or the apparent motions

914.399 --> 917.76
right so none of these celestials are

916.72 --> 921.36
just

917.76 --> 923.519
random they don't just

921.36 --> 924.5600000000001
appear for the first time out of nowhere

923.519 --> 927.68
there's

924.56 --> 931.3599999999999
no such celestial body except for

927.68 --> 932.3199999999999
things like comets and that is kind of

931.36 --> 935.36
weird though

932.32 --> 937.12
like that part i don't understand like

935.36 --> 939.44
if they can predict there's going to be

937.12 --> 942.5600000000001
a comet

939.44 --> 944.639
but do they is it

942.56 --> 947.04
can they really predict when a comet

944.639 --> 951.44
appears

947.04 --> 953.519
i mean there's like prophecies of comets

951.44 --> 954.48
they don't know if they're biblical but

953.519 --> 957.12
they are

954.48 --> 958.16
associated with certain events and they

957.12 --> 961.36
are predicted

958.16 --> 964.7199999999999
in forecasts like into the future

961.36 --> 966.9590000000001
but when they appear are they predicted

964.72 --> 971.6
ahead of time before they appear

966.959 --> 971.5999999999999
through the star map as it were or

971.68 --> 974.8
is it just like oh it's appeared okay

973.839 --> 977.759
and then

974.8 --> 979.68
like oh look the comet is there this is

977.759 --> 980.5600000000001
what we've deduced where it's going and

979.68 --> 984.4799999999999
how long it

980.56 --> 984.4799999999999
could last i don't know for sure

984.8 --> 988.8
but all the planets and the stars

989.12 --> 992.32
right and the sun and the moon yeah

991.839 --> 994.72
they're

992.32 --> 997.839
all cyclical they've always been around

994.72 --> 997.839
for as long as we know

998.32 --> 1005.44
and yeah very easy to predict

1002.88 --> 1005.4399999999999
what they do

1008.56 --> 1012.3199999999999
mapped before the earth

1013.279 --> 1025.839
yeah pretty much aratazaza

1032.799 --> 1038.6399999999999
right so yeah the cyclical motions of of

1035.76 --> 1041.679
the celestial moving bodies

1038.64 --> 1044.7990000000002
and the stars they are quite predictable

1041.679 --> 1045.2800000000002
but yeah the other types of events like

1044.799 --> 1047.439
again

1045.28 --> 1048.48
like comets that's another matter i

1047.439 --> 1050.559
don't know

1048.48 --> 1051.52
if they are part of these prediction

1050.559 --> 1055.28
cycles and

1051.52 --> 1057.52
if so how how could they predict it just

1055.28 --> 1058.8799999999999
appears where before there wasn't

1057.52 --> 1060.799
anything

1058.88 --> 1062.16
and then goes away after time like how

1060.799 --> 1065.44
do they do that

1062.16 --> 1069.76
i that part i don't understand if

1065.44 --> 1069.76
if it's a part of those predictions

1070.48 --> 1073.76
some comments like haley are very

1072.24 --> 1078.4
regular right well then

1073.76 --> 1078.4
it is also cyclical in that sense i

1078.84 --> 1081.84
guess

1083.6 --> 1089.9189999999999
uh steamy traveler well no

1087.2 --> 1090.88
did celestial objects exist that's kind

1089.919 --> 1093.6000000000001
of

1090.88 --> 1094.4
already a contradictory statement

1093.6 --> 1097.9189999999999
because

1094.4 --> 1100.64
celestial objects really objects no no

1097.919 --> 1104.0800000000002
it's all light phenomena

1100.64 --> 1106.72
so and well the bible says

1104.08 --> 1107.6
the order in which things were created

1106.72 --> 1110.64
in genesis

1107.6 --> 1114.32
and the celestials definitely came after

1110.64 --> 1118.0
the earth was formed so

1114.32 --> 1120.48
no celestial objects presumed objects

1118.0 --> 1123.84
not actual objects no they did not exist

1120.48 --> 1123.84
before the earth

1135.28 --> 1138.6399999999999
hello seeking star water

1138.799 --> 1151.84
by the way

1162.84 --> 1167.12
um

1165.52 --> 1172.0
yeah thank you by the way for the good

1167.12 --> 1179.84
questions steamy traveler as usual

1172.0 --> 1179.84
keep them coming

1182.72 --> 1188.08
on the fifth day the waters were

1185.44 --> 1188.0800000000002
separated

1190.84 --> 1193.84
what

1194.4 --> 1197.52
are you sure about that

1213.039 --> 1216.4
what how does that work

1217.12 --> 1223.28
biblical that's quite a big story how is

1219.84 --> 1223.28
that written in the stars

1224.64 --> 1231.039
i mean if you're gonna tell me that

1228.48 --> 1232.4
during the proceedings of the biblical

1231.039 --> 1235.6
events

1232.4 --> 1235.8400000000001
the celestial events were also recorded

1235.6 --> 1238.8799999999999
and

1235.84 --> 1242.24
in that sense it could be like a

1238.88 --> 1244.64
a time map an indication

1242.24 --> 1245.28
basically like oh look the celesto would

1244.64 --> 1249.5200000000002
be

1245.28 --> 1252.559
like oh look it's that time on our watch

1249.52 --> 1255.76
right you could perhaps

1252.559 --> 1256.32
be able to pinpoint specific time events

1255.76 --> 1258.24
like that

1256.32 --> 1263.6
if you have that kind of oversight over

1258.24 --> 1265.36
the celestial sky clock

1263.6 --> 1267.9189999999999
but i don't know exactly what you mean

1265.36 --> 1269.52
with the story is literally written in

1267.919 --> 1273.3600000000001
stars

1269.52 --> 1274.1589999999999
that sounds kind of from the same train

1273.36 --> 1277.84
of thinking as

1274.159 --> 1281.44
jesus is the sun right it that's uh

1277.84 --> 1286.559
that's gnostic basically

1281.44 --> 1286.559
there there is this thing about that

1286.799 --> 1292.1589999999999
but i don't know if that's what you mean

1289.679 --> 1292.159
hold on

1294.559 --> 1298.32
oh right ancient cultures believe

1296.559 --> 1301.84
astrological alignments

1298.32 --> 1301.84
influence the realm of man

1303.039 --> 1307.679
well yeah astrology i guess other

1306.32 --> 1311.12
celestials

1307.679 --> 1318.88
do seem to have some kind of influence

1311.12 --> 1322.1589999999999
like whether you perceive it or not

1318.88 --> 1324.7990000000002
but yeah

1322.159 --> 1325.8400000000001
it's very difficult to actually pinpoint

1324.799 --> 1328.8799999999999
some specific

1325.84 --> 1333.6
causal relation for the influence

1328.88 --> 1336.7990000000002
right but it seems to correlate

1333.6 --> 1336.799
with these alignments

1337.6 --> 1342.48
it's very hard to grasp though you know

1339.679 --> 1342.48
astrology

1342.559 --> 1349.12
but even astrology

1345.84 --> 1349.84
basically functions on just the the four

1349.12 --> 1353.6789999999999
knowledge

1349.84 --> 1355.6
of cyclical nature of things

1353.679 --> 1356.96
right that's what i think most

1355.6 --> 1359.4399999999998
astrologers really

1356.96 --> 1360.559
work with just if you know cycles of

1359.44 --> 1365.3600000000001
things

1360.559 --> 1368.96
then then you can basically

1365.36 --> 1371.039
map out the wave of events

1368.96 --> 1373.2
up and down up and down right and then

1371.039 --> 1374.96
you can use a prediction like that

1373.2 --> 1376.4
and i think that's what so makes some

1374.96 --> 1379.28
astrologers

1376.4 --> 1382.24
really good at it also because they kind

1379.28 --> 1384.8799999999999
of have a better feel for the

1382.24 --> 1386.0
fractal nature of reality and they're

1384.88 --> 1389.1200000000001
using

1386.0 --> 1390.64
astrology as a as a as a set of

1389.12 --> 1393.6
guidelines

1390.64 --> 1395.8400000000001
for what they do it's difficult like

1393.6 --> 1395.84
that

1404.96 --> 1411.2
a race of grahas

1408.32 --> 1414.24
never heard of that term terminology

1411.2 --> 1414.24
terror 306

1415.6 --> 1431.84
is that an indian or a hindu

1443.2 --> 1448.0800000000002
hello sleeping warrior how are you doing

1454.96 --> 1459.8400000000001
huh all right

1464.559 --> 1472.52
what okay and this skips

1468.64 --> 1476.0800000000002
andy skips right can we not use the

1472.52 --> 1480.72
antecedent consequence relationship

1476.08 --> 1480.72
what to determine what the sun is

1481.52 --> 1486.0
uh well that all depends on the context

1485.36 --> 1488.1589999999999
i i don't

1486.0 --> 1490.48
see how an antecedent consequence

1488.159 --> 1491.5200000000002
relationship is directly involved in the

1490.48 --> 1494.279
sun

1491.52 --> 1497.76
other than if you go by what

1494.279 --> 1501.679
heliocentrism presupposes it to be

1497.76 --> 1502.4
and then yes like gas pressure without a

1501.679 --> 1506.72
container

1502.4 --> 1509.8400000000001
makes that idea quite impossible

1506.72 --> 1512.88
it's a burning gas right next to a

1509.84 --> 1516.559
vacuum that makes no sense

1512.88 --> 1519.159
so i don't know if that's what you meant

1516.559 --> 1521.12
other than that from within

1519.159 --> 1523.919
heliocentrism

1521.12 --> 1526.84
but outside of it in how i conceive of

1523.919 --> 1529.919
the heavens with celestial

1526.84 --> 1530.32
non-local holographic phenomenon i don't

1529.919 --> 1532.96
see

1530.32 --> 1543.84
how any kind of antecedent consequent

1532.96 --> 1543.8400000000001
relationship applies to that

1556.24 --> 1560.48
if that's what you think it's kind of

1559.2 --> 1562.64
difficult because

1560.48 --> 1563.76
i think the old testament was trying to

1562.64 --> 1565.6000000000001
achieve something

1563.76 --> 1567.919
differently right this yeah the sky

1565.6 --> 1571.6789999999999
clock

1567.919 --> 1575.3600000000001
the thing is when you get caught up

1571.679 --> 1577.6000000000001
in it and in the ability to kind of

1575.36 --> 1579.039
figure out the cyclical nature of where

1577.6 --> 1581.6789999999999
things go

1579.039 --> 1584.1589999999999
it does something else to you if you

1581.679 --> 1587.1200000000001
really get stuck in that

1584.159 --> 1587.1200000000001
there's certain like

1588.88 --> 1596.7990000000002
in the moment sensories

1593.6 --> 1600.1589999999999
that they get

1596.799 --> 1602.32
railroaded over right this is

1600.159 --> 1603.679
i think that this is really legitimate

1602.32 --> 1607.2
thing

1603.679 --> 1609.2
that happens right if you

1607.2 --> 1611.52
really get into astrology and you're

1609.2 --> 1613.8400000000001
like fixated with it on your mind

1611.52 --> 1615.9189999999999
that fixation despite it's all its

1613.84 --> 1620.6
prediction capabilities

1615.919 --> 1623.5200000000002
will make you not see spontaneous

1620.6 --> 1626.1589999999999
realizations that are more in the moment

1623.52 --> 1627.12
right so it's it can distract i think

1626.159 --> 1630.24
that might be

1627.12 --> 1632.2399999999998
what the bible was warning for why

1630.24 --> 1633.2
astrology could be considered as

1632.24 --> 1637.2
dangerous because

1633.2 --> 1641.8400000000001
it distracts you from in the moment

1637.2 --> 1641.8400000000001
being right

1651.84 --> 1655.84
there's no fed today oh

1657.039 --> 1659.36
okay

1665.52 --> 1670.08
all right well i guess i'll have to go a

1667.279 --> 1670.08
little longer then

1671.76 --> 1675.84
oh hello professor phil bell

1678.0 --> 1681.279
do i think pete tag or this was a

1680.08 --> 1685.52
flatter

1681.279 --> 1688.0
dude like i don't even know for sure if

1685.52 --> 1689.12
back then the people and the

1688.0 --> 1691.76
philosophers

1689.12 --> 1692.7199999999998
and the mathematicians if they even had

1691.76 --> 1696.1589999999999
a real

1692.72 --> 1698.72
conception of cosmogeny

1696.159 --> 1699.6000000000001
if if they even really cared they even

1698.72 --> 1702.799
considered

1699.6 --> 1705.4399999999998
that beyond just this is the land

1702.799 --> 1707.36
and those are the stars i don't know i

1705.44 --> 1708.0800000000002
don't know if they have even had a sense

1707.36 --> 1711.84
for

1708.08 --> 1714.24
cosmogeny that they would debate about

1711.84 --> 1717.6
no it's a globe or it's flat or it's

1714.24 --> 1717.6
concave or whatever

1720.48 --> 1725.84
i don't know tarik 306.

1728.799 --> 1737.52
but at the same time i the rough

1732.48 --> 1741.039
idea is that based on my own experiences

1737.52 --> 1744.96
to truly be able to master

1741.039 --> 1746.8799999999999
the globe right to be able to explain it

1744.96 --> 1750.48
in a convincing way

1746.88 --> 1752.7990000000002
to others you would have to be

1750.48 --> 1755.76
a flat earther you would have to be a

1752.799 --> 1760.32
flat earther in order to master it

1755.76 --> 1760.32
so maybe that could be a proper answer

1761.2 --> 1768.0
if it if pythagoras indeed got all that

1764.48 --> 1772.3990000000001
technical up to cosmogeny standards

1768.0 --> 1772.799
right because you can't even properly

1772.399 --> 1775.84
map

1772.799 --> 1781.84
out the globe if you don't

1775.84 --> 1781.84
know well the real thing

1793.36 --> 1797.6789999999999
everyone on earth is a flat earther yeah

1806.32 --> 1809.84
error stop phonies

1810.24 --> 1814.88
that's a good one hello slo-mo moon

1820.84 --> 1823.84
buggy

1834.84 --> 1837.84
hmm

1851.279 --> 1853.679
wow

1856.88 --> 1865.8400000000001
this trolls just woke up

1888.08 --> 1893.84
uh that's fine i meant you that that can

1890.84 --> 1893.84
happen

1894.96 --> 1899.6000000000001
but since i'm right on top of chat right

1897.12 --> 1902.559
now it's very likely i'm gonna be first

1899.6 --> 1904.0
with the moderation actions right

1902.559 --> 1907.12
despite my screen

1904.0 --> 1921.84
blinking and [ __ ] still like the chat

1907.12 --> 1921.84
is very quick glad of that

1930.24 --> 1937.519
oh look at that oh

1934.0 --> 1941.44
look at that beautiful nice blue

1937.519 --> 1941.44
patch up there isn't that amazing

1943.84 --> 1949.84
see the halo of the reflecting

1946.48 --> 1949.84
holographic sunlight

1950.0 --> 1953.6
because it's not literally over there as

1952.799 --> 1957.279
you can

1953.6 --> 1957.279
maybe tell by the shadowing

1957.919 --> 1965.919
stupid fly

1962.88 --> 1965.919
walking on the window

1966.559 --> 1970.32
i think i'm gonna let him out for a

1974.84 --> 1980.329
second

1977.14 --> 1980.3290000000002
[Applause]

1988.84 --> 1991.84
now

2028.399 --> 2033.5189999999998
yeah yeah yeah thanks for reminding me i

2030.72 --> 2047.84
was on mute yep

2033.519 --> 2047.84
we got an our origin so that's hilarious

2053.359 --> 2057.119
wow so he actually spelled his own name

2056.159 --> 2060.96
wrong

2057.119 --> 2065.04
and then he corrected his name

2060.96 --> 2065.599
in a comment that's that's such a sock

2065.04 --> 2068.0
thing

2065.599 --> 2068.0
to do

2071.919 --> 2076.399
a tiny womble

2086.839 --> 2089.839
what

2091.76 --> 2095.76
bible says the earth shall reel back and

2094.639 --> 2102.6400000000003
forth like a drunk

2095.76 --> 2107.44
what are you talking about is that

2102.64 --> 2107.44
during the end times

2115.359 --> 2120.56
i don't see that as a wobbling of an

2117.52 --> 2120.56
axis right

2120.72 --> 2125.68
i think that could be more like the

2122.8 --> 2128.5600000000004
shaking of it is going to

2125.68 --> 2129.2799999999997
wobble the earth around like in a huge

2128.56 --> 2131.52
earthquake

2129.28 --> 2133.28
which is usually caused by some kind of

2131.52 --> 2135.68
oscillation

2133.28 --> 2138.079
which can make the earth kind of move

2135.68 --> 2141.2
around like a restless ocean

2138.079 --> 2141.52
would so maybe that's what that points

2141.2 --> 2144.3199999999997
at

2141.52 --> 2148.32
i don't see that as i don't see how an

2144.32 --> 2148.32
axis would be involved of anything of

2154.27 --> 2159.839
[Music]

2156.839 --> 2159.839
that

2160.2 --> 2164.4399999999996
[Music]

2180.16 --> 2188.72
no it is oh no just no

2186.24 --> 2188.72
okay

2199.04 --> 2203.52
seem to be hand waving my explanation

2202.0 --> 2208.0
and then

2203.52 --> 2211.28
a curse or a lie oh well

2208.0 --> 2211.839
or maybe it's just like a big earthquake

2211.28 --> 2216.8
and

2211.839 --> 2216.7999999999997
the earth will ripple like an ocean

2217.04 --> 2219.359
right

2220.88 --> 2229.839
don't see how that by the way relates

2223.839 --> 2229.839
into an axis still anyway hold on

2240.839 --> 2243.839
hmm

2266.96 --> 2272.96
oh by the way tiny wombo

2270.079 --> 2274.079
yeah yesterday i was i was going kind of

2272.96 --> 2275.92
at it

2274.079 --> 2278.0
with you was that yesterday the day

2275.92 --> 2279.6800000000003
before but you said that when i went

2278.0 --> 2282.32
away at some point there was this weird

2279.68 --> 2285.359
flickering going on

2282.32 --> 2287.3590000000004
and i i kind of thought you still meant

2285.359 --> 2289.44
like the blinking of my youtube screen

2287.359 --> 2292.88
but i watched it back

2289.44 --> 2294.0
and there was like this weird light

2292.88 --> 2296.48
yeah pulse

2294.0 --> 2299.68
[Music]

2296.48 --> 2302.16
that i i did see it when i watched it

2299.68 --> 2304.96
back that was kind of weird

2302.16 --> 2307.1189999999997
i have no idea what could cause that but

2304.96 --> 2313.839
it's probably a focus issue from the

2307.119 --> 2313.839
webcam or something but it looked weird

2324.839 --> 2327.839
so

2336.16 --> 2340.72
to and fro like a drunkard and shall be

2338.96 --> 2344.88
removed

2340.72 --> 2346.8799999999997
like a cottage that's weird to say that

2344.88 --> 2348.2400000000002
and the transgression thereof shall be

2346.88 --> 2351.44
heavy upon it

2348.24 --> 2354.9599999999996
and shall fall not rise what does that

2351.44 --> 2358.7200000000003
mean shall be removed like a cottage

2354.96 --> 2358.7200000000003
but yeah real back and forth

2359.839 --> 2363.7599999999998
sounds like a really big earthquake

2365.68 --> 2370.3999999999996
maybe it's like a giant earthquake and

2368.0 --> 2374.24
liquefaction at the same time

2370.4 --> 2375.92
and maybe that's how like everything

2374.24 --> 2378.3999999999996
will literally just sink

2375.92 --> 2381.839
into the dart or something right sound

2378.4 --> 2383.92
that sounds really [ __ ] up by the

2381.839 --> 2386.16
like literally everything could be like

2383.92 --> 2388.32
liquefaction

2386.16 --> 2389.2799999999997
just suddenly everything starts

2388.32 --> 2391.6800000000003
vibrating

2389.28 --> 2393.28
shaking and everything just crashes and

2391.68 --> 2397.839
sinks into the dirt

2393.28 --> 2397.8390000000004
now that would be freaky man

2416.0 --> 2419.839
you're not making a whole lot of sense

2417.76 --> 2425.599
to me really i don't even understand

2419.839 --> 2427.7599999999998
what your point is here

2425.599 --> 2429.52
is wobbling not swinging back and forth

2427.76 --> 2433.0400000000004
well that's a reification

2429.52 --> 2436.64
because there's no mentioning of

2433.04 --> 2439.2799999999997
wobbling swinging back and forth

2436.64 --> 2441.1189999999997
like a drunkard well do drunkers go

2439.28 --> 2442.2400000000002
spinning around their axes and that's

2441.119 --> 2446.0
why they fall over

2442.24 --> 2447.7599999999998
no they do experience

2446.0 --> 2450.56
probably in their head like they're

2447.76 --> 2454.0
turning but they're not actually turning

2450.56 --> 2457.2
right so you're drafting in this axis

2454.0 --> 2462.56
in the setup and i don't see it at all

2457.2 --> 2462.56
i've already gave an alternative

2464.839 --> 2467.839
several

2476.48 --> 2483.44
okay yeah that's really nice

2480.72 --> 2485.04
that it also means wobble but since

2483.44 --> 2488.56
that's not the word

2485.04 --> 2492.839
that was used you're

2488.56 --> 2496.64
yeah i just because it can mean

2492.839 --> 2499.04
something does it mean that you can just

2496.64 --> 2500.0
interchange it and then latch on other

2499.04 --> 2503.92
meanings that are

2500.0 --> 2507.68
also tied into that word into it

2503.92 --> 2523.839
it's not proof of an axis just because

2507.68 --> 2523.839
wobble could be associated with the word

2533.92 --> 2537.839
well why would i look up the word you

2535.839 --> 2540.0789999999997
just did that for me

2537.839 --> 2542.16
i know what a wobble is i know where it

2540.079 --> 2546.7200000000003
can tie in

2542.16 --> 2546.72
yeah and the synonyms but look

2547.839 --> 2551.92
two words can be synonyms yet the one

2550.96 --> 2554.56
word

2551.92 --> 2555.92
will have a specific set of implications

2554.56 --> 2558.56
tied into it

2555.92 --> 2559.599
fields based on where that word is

2558.56 --> 2562.64
associated with

2559.599 --> 2564.56
other fields right and then you have the

2562.64 --> 2566.0
other interpretation yeah they can be

2564.56 --> 2569.2799999999997
synonymous

2566.0 --> 2571.2
they can be interchangeable but

2569.28 --> 2573.599
that other word might have a whole

2571.2 --> 2574.72
different range of implications that do

2573.599 --> 2579.04
not match

2574.72 --> 2580.56
the fields of the other synonym words so

2579.04 --> 2583.44
just because they're synonym doesn't

2580.56 --> 2585.839
mean they're just easily interchangeable

2583.44 --> 2585.839
you know

2590.56 --> 2594.96
like especially when we're talking about

2592.319 --> 2594.96
the bible

2596.16 --> 2607.839
the words are very specific for a reason

2618.8 --> 2635.8390000000004
maybe we live on a crust off top of

2621.119 --> 2635.839
jelly here

2646.839 --> 2649.839
hmm

2666.88 --> 2671.92
uh no george sanford you're right and

2670.48 --> 2674.8
you're wrong

2671.92 --> 2675.76
yeah it was translated from english does

2674.8 --> 2678.88
doesn't mean

2675.76 --> 2680.88
leave them words alone no it's just okay

2678.88 --> 2683.6800000000003
you're taking that word well go back to

2680.88 --> 2683.6800000000003
the original

2684.319 --> 2688.079
original language and then see what it

2687.44 --> 2690.96
means

2688.079 --> 2692.96
there how it came to be translated to

2690.96 --> 2695.359
english like it was

2692.96 --> 2697.2
and then figure out how did the old ones

2695.359 --> 2700.16
say it

2697.2 --> 2701.5989999999997
and do you have the same synonym range

2700.16 --> 2703.5989999999997
over there

2701.599 --> 2706.7200000000003
or is that because of the modernization

2703.599 --> 2706.7200000000003
of english language

2709.68 --> 2719.839
right you do that

2734.4 --> 2736.7200000000003
right

2739.28 --> 2743.599
right i i just wanted to remind you

2741.68 --> 2745.44
universally

2743.599 --> 2747.04
that yeah when there's talk of a

2745.44 --> 2749.68
drunkard

2747.04 --> 2750.16
right yeah what are you gonna associate

2749.68 --> 2753.2799999999997
with that

2750.16 --> 2756.3999999999996
spinning but guess what

2753.28 --> 2761.3590000000004
the spin associated with the drunkard

2756.4 --> 2762.319
is not actual it just seems to them like

2761.359 --> 2764.96
it's spinning

2762.319 --> 2765.839
they're not actually spinning so that's

2764.96 --> 2768.2400000000002
like

2765.839 --> 2771.68
extra ironic i think really that you

2768.24 --> 2771.68
seem to be overlooking that

2773.359 --> 2789.839
right so the axis

2776.56 --> 2789.839
of the not actual spin

2809.2 --> 2820.7999999999997
right so so what does that all describe

2816.079 --> 2824.4
it's emotion it's not

2820.8 --> 2827.52
no again it's like a

2824.4 --> 2830.319
rocking everything that's in there

2827.52 --> 2834.64
just yeah basically backs my point right

2830.319 --> 2834.64
always go back to the original language

2843.2 --> 2846.48
right yeah george sanford yeah getting

2844.8 --> 2849.28
the other languages

2846.48 --> 2850.96
in there would also help to refine the

2849.28 --> 2854.2400000000002
point even further

2850.96 --> 2856.7200000000003
but yeah there's no mention in hebrew

2854.24 --> 2857.5989999999997
about any type of form of spinning or

2856.72 --> 2860.48
axis of

2857.599 --> 2873.839
any sort it's all description of a

2860.48 --> 2873.839
certain type of motion

2898.96 --> 2903.839
okay the i 1864 that's weird

2910.8 --> 2914.6400000000003
is that in genesis actually i i'd like

2914.16 --> 2918.16
to see

2914.64 --> 2918.16
some more reference of that

2921.68 --> 2929.839
to never heard of those words before

2940.839 --> 2943.839
so

2954.079 --> 2957.8390000000004
it's from jordan maxwell

2961.68 --> 2964.24
what what

2967.2 --> 2974.24
you mean jordan maxwell pointed it out

2971.52 --> 2974.24
okay fine

2974.64 --> 2981.5989999999997
but did anybody actually

2978.079 --> 2984.48
replicate the approach and found

2981.599 --> 2988.319
that it was correct or is everybody just

2984.48 --> 2988.319
are you just taking his word for it

2993.44 --> 2999.839
janice is translated by jordan maxwell

2996.839 --> 2999.839
okay

3002.559 --> 3007.76
that sounds interesting i i will

3005.839 --> 3013.839
actually look at that

3007.76 --> 3013.8390000000004
see if i can find that

3028.8 --> 3032.319
oh right that guy

3033.76 --> 3037.1600000000003
well you do know that the guy is like a

3036.079 --> 3041.8390000000004
infamous

3037.16 --> 3041.839
heliocentrist though

3044.16 --> 3051.2799999999997
and i think i should but yeah

3047.839 --> 3055.839
i think i'll i'll take a look at it oh

3051.28 --> 3055.8390000000004
one and a half hours long jesus

3077.359 --> 3082.96
i think this is probably

3080.88 --> 3084.4
the video you're referring to i'll post

3082.96 --> 3097.839
it others can

3084.4 --> 3097.839
check it out as well i don't know man

3100.079 --> 3105.52
if look if just one guy like 20 years

3103.359 --> 3108.4
ago or something

3105.52 --> 3108.4
is saying that

3109.28 --> 3125.8390000000004
and nobody else is right then

3113.119 --> 3125.839
then it gets a little suspicious to me

3131.119 --> 3135.839
no one knows it all no but that makes no

3133.52 --> 3137.44
sense because if there is just a hebrew

3135.839 --> 3140.16
version of it

3137.44 --> 3140.88
and it says something different then

3140.16 --> 3143.5989999999997
where are

3140.88 --> 3144.559
all the other confirmations of that like

3143.599 --> 3149.3590000000004
yeah you're right

3144.559 --> 3151.28
it does say that if it's just him

3149.359 --> 3153.839
that's a little weird that's a little

3151.28 --> 3153.8390000000004
off

3182.88 --> 3186.0
why do you keep saying that [ __ ] i don't

3185.44 --> 3189.44
know

3186.0 --> 3192.64
that is i am not some i am our win why

3189.44 --> 3195.359
do you keep asking this

3192.64 --> 3197.68
you know there's just there is billions

3195.359 --> 3201.359
of people in the world

3197.68 --> 3204.48
and most people have multiple

3201.359 --> 3207.7599999999998
look-alikes multiple okay

3204.48 --> 3209.52
over in several generations like

3207.76 --> 3210.8
two generations later there might be

3209.52 --> 3212.72
somebody born that looks

3210.8 --> 3214.88
that's not even related close to look

3212.72 --> 3218.64
exactly like you

3214.88 --> 3223.839
this happens all the time

3218.64 --> 3223.839
it's just why why bring it up

3234.8 --> 3242.4
jordan's source is a chief rabble well

3238.96 --> 3243.119
a person is a source where is the actual

3242.4 --> 3246.319
writing

3243.119 --> 3246.319
and the sourcing of that

3248.839 --> 3251.839
what

3262.8 --> 3267.76
god it's gonna make me google it so

3276.839 --> 3293.839
annoying

3278.64 --> 3293.839
yeah nothing it's just [ __ ]

3318.839 --> 3321.839
uh

3333.2 --> 3336.96
okay the i8064 i'll have to take your

3336.4 --> 3338.48
word for it

3336.96 --> 3341.92
because i have no idea what you look

3338.48 --> 3341.92
like so

3346.839 --> 3349.839
whatever

3376.88 --> 3381.6800000000003
whatever man dude you could be a

3383.44 --> 3390.88
humanoid squirrel for all i care

3386.88 --> 3395.2000000000003
you're literally a youtube account

3390.88 --> 3395.2000000000003
with a name that is in my chat that's

3395.359 --> 3399.68
look if you want to back that up by

3397.599 --> 3401.119
actually making a video about yourself

3399.68 --> 3402.48
or something and putting it on your

3401.119 --> 3419.839
channel

3402.48 --> 3419.839
then i might get an opinion on that

3427.79 --> 3430.849
[Music]

3438.799 --> 3441.92
yes amanda young yeah i do know you look

3440.88 --> 3447.839
like your icon

3441.92 --> 3447.839
you look great

3464.559 --> 3472.0
well john 33 well maybe there is no

3468.0 --> 3474.88
interest in us doing that

3472.0 --> 3478.16
except for grassroots right the interest

3474.88 --> 3481.599
in exploration is really grassroots

3478.16 --> 3481.5989999999997
i don't think governments

3482.72 --> 3489.839
are like really interested in doing any

3485.28 --> 3489.8390000000004
of that

3521.2 --> 3525.4399999999996
i don't know what the hell you're saying

3523.119 --> 3527.52
man can you please stop it it's getting

3525.44 --> 3531.52
on my nerves

3527.52 --> 3533.92
you you're trying to reify some kind of

3531.52 --> 3535.2
actual rotation [ __ ] or something

3533.92 --> 3545.839
and you need to stop it

3535.2 --> 3545.839
it's getting really annoying

3547.359 --> 3553.68
yeah the earth is not a

3550.4 --> 3556.96
ball it doesn't have an

3553.68 --> 3560.0
axis of rotation that doesn't exist

3556.96 --> 3562.88
there is no rotation there's no axis

3560.0 --> 3562.88
right there's no

3563.04 --> 3568.319
axis based motion happening at all

3566.4 --> 3569.52
and if there's going to be something

3568.319 --> 3573.44
shaking

3569.52 --> 3578.4
or staggering that could be

3573.44 --> 3582.16
a motion just like an earthquake

3578.4 --> 3585.52
shaking is shaking an axis

3582.16 --> 3588.319
no it's not is shaking spinning

3585.52 --> 3588.319
no it's not

3593.28 --> 3601.8390000000004
can there be rotation without an axis no

3595.76 --> 3601.8390000000004
roger emcee

3603.92 --> 3608.96
but axis is also virtual right so it all

3607.119 --> 3612.1600000000003
depends on what's rotating if

3608.96 --> 3614.0
is it light that's rotating

3612.16 --> 3615.2799999999997
or is it a physical thing now when

3614.0 --> 3619.599
there's a physical thing

3615.28 --> 3622.799
rotating then an axis becomes quite

3619.599 --> 3628.48
tangible because of the

3622.799 --> 3630.559
division of the forces

3628.48 --> 3631.839
this centripetal force is subjected to

3630.559 --> 3643.8390000000004
the whole physical thing

3631.839 --> 3643.839
in rotation

3654.839 --> 3657.839
um

3673.28 --> 3678.88
yeah you're not making any damn sense

3676.079 --> 3684.079
aratazala

3678.88 --> 3687.599
arataza rathazala seriously

3684.079 --> 3699.8390000000004
you're not communicating

3687.599 --> 3699.839
you're chanting and it's weird

3736.319 --> 3741.839
scripture is talking about a curse

3739.68 --> 3741.839
it

3744.96 --> 3751.119
well maybe do a presentation about that

3748.0 --> 3755.839
with some cohesive information to back

3751.119 --> 3755.839
it up

3767.68 --> 3771.839
thoughts on the possible alien deception

3773.839 --> 3778.799
it's a giant distraction story based on

3776.92 --> 3781.799
heliocentrism

3778.799 --> 3783.92
right it's been developed through

3781.799 --> 3786.0
hallucinogenic studies

3783.92 --> 3787.2000000000003
i brought forth a theory on the flat

3786.0 --> 3790.16
earth debates

3787.2 --> 3791.4399999999996
about it actually came up with it in a

3790.16 --> 3794.24
call with rasta had

3791.44 --> 3794.2400000000002
some time ago

3794.48 --> 3799.359
because of the timing of it all that

3797.52 --> 3800.96
i think there's a very distinct

3799.359 --> 3805.5989999999997
correlation

3800.96 --> 3809.44
between the between the design

3805.599 --> 3812.96
and the idea of gray aliens

3809.44 --> 3814.48
the lsd studies performed on the

3812.96 --> 3817.28
military

3814.48 --> 3820.0
during the era of the moon landing and

3817.28 --> 3823.3590000000004
the vietnam war

3820.0 --> 3823.76
and i think that because the primary

3823.359 --> 3826.799
test

3823.76 --> 3828.88
subjects were american soldiers

3826.799 --> 3830.24
right a lot of them came back from the

3828.88 --> 3834.4
war

3830.24 --> 3837.4399999999996
were seriously traumatized then they got

3834.4 --> 3839.839
some therapy and

3837.44 --> 3840.64
hey it was at the time like oh yeah lsd

3839.839 --> 3844.0
you can

3840.64 --> 3847.5989999999997
use it in the therapy to get over

3844.0 --> 3851.119
ptsd and i think that's

3847.599 --> 3853.599
when like with multiple soldiers

3851.119 --> 3854.7200000000003
that they experienced similar type of

3853.599 --> 3857.839
visions

3854.72 --> 3860.319
because that can't happen and that

3857.839 --> 3862.4
like the spirit of the vietnam war and

3860.319 --> 3863.7599999999998
maybe the attitude of the vietnamese

3862.4 --> 3867.039
soldiers or

3863.76 --> 3869.039
like a reflection of arimon to that

3867.039 --> 3872.4
specific situation

3869.039 --> 3874.3190000000004
expressed itself as grey aliens i think

3872.4 --> 3877.359
that gray aliens

3874.319 --> 3879.92
came out of the heads of

3877.359 --> 3880.96
american soldiers that went to vietnam

3879.92 --> 3883.839
war

3880.96 --> 3883.839
that's what i think

3884.079 --> 3891.92
and that's how like a cohesive

3888.64 --> 3895.1189999999997
design was really

3891.92 --> 3897.119
settled upon by the well by the

3895.119 --> 3898.48
programmers by the ones doing those

3897.119 --> 3901.92
experiments

3898.48 --> 3903.76
that's what i think so they they plucked

3901.92 --> 3905.839
it from the psyche

3903.76 --> 3908.7200000000003
or maybe cruelly or maybe crowd is just

3905.839 --> 3912.5589999999997
a stupid [ __ ] piece of [ __ ]

3908.72 --> 3917.839
[ __ ] crowley what a [ __ ]

3912.559 --> 3917.8390000000004
ultimate loser i hate that guy

3918.559 --> 3925.3590000000004
yeah he probably foresaw that [ __ ] right

3923.039 --> 3928.2400000000002
crowley was all about yeah the the

3925.359 --> 3930.96
programming of the [ __ ] beast

3928.24 --> 3932.799
he was just a loser championing like oh

3930.96 --> 3933.359
this is how the future events will

3932.799 --> 3935.68
enroll

3933.359 --> 3938.64
this [ __ ] and that carnage and he was

3935.68 --> 3941.839
just a piece of [ __ ]

3938.64 --> 3941.839
maybe rotten elf

3942.72 --> 3951.839
it didn't invent anything [ __ ] loser

3953.44 --> 3958.64
his demon resembles a gray whatever

3962.24 --> 3965.52
yeah you can block somebody's comment if

3964.16 --> 3967.68
you like

3965.52 --> 3979.839
alright is a retezala but i don't

3967.68 --> 3979.839
recommend it

3985.039 --> 3992.2400000000002
right so who gives a [ __ ] if one

3988.799 --> 3993.2
stupid satanic devil surrenders piece of

3992.24 --> 3996.319
[ __ ]

3993.2 --> 3999.2
early on drew a grey who gives a [ __ ]

3996.319 --> 4002.16
about that [ __ ]

3999.2 --> 4004.48
he's a piece of [ __ ] may he rot in hell

4002.16 --> 4007.68
can't say it enough

4004.48 --> 4010.64
no i'm more certain that it was

4007.68 --> 4011.7599999999998
concluded upon because a whole bunch of

4010.64 --> 4014.72
people

4011.76 --> 4016.0
were tested upon revealed the same views

4014.72 --> 4018.72
and they were not all

4016.0 --> 4020.0
into [ __ ] crowley okay soldiers

4018.72 --> 4021.839
american soldiers were

4020.0 --> 4023.68
not into crowley most of them were

4021.839 --> 4025.839
probably christians

4023.68 --> 4026.96
or semi-christians didn't even know

4025.839 --> 4030.48
about crowley

4026.96 --> 4033.119
who gave a [ __ ] about that [ __ ] right

4030.48 --> 4034.0
so they did not see that design and then

4033.119 --> 4036.96
hallucinate

4034.0 --> 4037.52
it no it's a universal thing that

4036.96 --> 4040.079
happens

4037.52 --> 4041.7599999999998
in these situations and yeah they are

4040.079 --> 4045.52
kind of resembling like

4041.76 --> 4050.3190000000004
demons even in my description right

4045.52 --> 4053.68
they could be aromantic entities

4050.319 --> 4054.72
that came in to the spiritual experience

4053.68 --> 4059.44
of the carnage

4054.72 --> 4059.4399999999996
literally to soak up the the carnage

4059.52 --> 4065.2
that just worked similarly seen

4062.96 --> 4065.2
right

4066.0 --> 4072.72
and that's because just one [ __ ] guy

4069.76 --> 4073.44
draws an alien oh my god what a

4072.72 --> 4076.0
visionary

4073.44 --> 4076.7200000000003
no that's governments don't give a [ __ ]

4076.0 --> 4078.319
people

4076.72 --> 4080.48
unless they get obsessed with this

4078.319 --> 4082.0
cultist piece of [ __ ]

4080.48 --> 4084.559
they're not gonna give a [ __ ] either

4082.0 --> 4087.599
they're gonna stay clear away from it

4084.559 --> 4089.3590000000004
they're wise but when a whole bunch of

4087.599 --> 4091.28
people are tested upon and

4089.359 --> 4092.64
individually not knowing about each

4091.28 --> 4095.2000000000003
other not knowing about this [ __ ]

4092.64 --> 4098.639999999999
crowley character

4095.2 --> 4100.639999999999
translate express describe

4098.64 --> 4102.56
the gray aliens in their experience in a

4100.64 --> 4103.679
whole bunch well then you got a

4102.56 --> 4106.799
synchronized

4103.679 --> 4109.359
thing that really gives like this

4106.799 --> 4111.5199999999995
bottom for like yeah this is actually a

4109.359 --> 4114.0
thing this could be reified into

4111.52 --> 4116.839000000001
physical reality if we would like to

4114.0 --> 4118.0
but there seems to be a coherent

4116.839 --> 4120.719
phenomenon

4118.0 --> 4121.279
right that's why i think it came from

4120.719 --> 4133.839
that not

4121.279 --> 4133.839000000001
[ __ ] crowding piece of [ __ ]

4143.679 --> 4149.1990000000005
or cold's pre-programming you don't even

4146.56 --> 4151.52
know what that means

4149.199 --> 4152.879999999999
occult pre-programming only works when

4151.52 --> 4156.0
people get into

4152.88 --> 4158.839
it and start saying oh it is the ada i

4156.0 --> 4161.359
know crowley it is the idea

4158.839 --> 4164.4
no no

4161.359 --> 4165.04
they weren't again i already explained

4164.4 --> 4167.5199999999995
this

4165.04 --> 4168.88
so just probably were not into this

4167.52 --> 4170.799000000001
[ __ ] crowley character

4168.88 --> 4172.96
although dude i might be proven

4170.799 --> 4175.6
historically wrong maybe they were

4172.96 --> 4176.88
i don't know i'm just baseline assuming

4175.6 --> 4179.679
they weren't

4176.88 --> 4181.6
that they weren't all just like oh you

4179.679 --> 4183.6
have to be a satanist or something

4181.6 --> 4185.4400000000005
bullshitty like that to get into the

4183.6 --> 4186.96
military i don't think so i think that

4185.44 --> 4190.08
most were just christians

4186.96 --> 4190.08
jews perhaps and

4190.159 --> 4197.04
not freaking satanists

4193.6 --> 4200.320000000001
right i think

4197.04 --> 4202.64
they still saw the same extra

4200.32 --> 4205.759999999999
dimensional perhaps phenomenon

4202.64 --> 4207.76
of the grey aliens in that scenario of

4205.76 --> 4210.320000000001
their vietnam war experiences

4207.76 --> 4217.84
and that's how they came to it that's

4210.32 --> 4217.84
what i think

4221.12 --> 4224.4
america used christianity as a clerk

4223.04 --> 4227.84
well that's

4224.4 --> 4231.28
the country doesn't mean that the people

4227.84 --> 4233.6
themselves use christianity as a cloak

4231.28 --> 4233.599999999999
right

4236.88 --> 4239.84
people are still going to be people

4238.32 --> 4241.5199999999995
americans are still going to get be

4239.84 --> 4242.56
americans they're not all just going to

4241.52 --> 4246.320000000001
be pretend

4242.56 --> 4248.2390000000005
christians like like grabblers

4246.32 --> 4250.159
because that's gonna show people are

4248.239 --> 4251.199
going to know that they are lying about

4250.159 --> 4253.199
being christian

4251.199 --> 4254.96
that because that becomes blatantly

4253.199 --> 4258.719
apparent when you're faking it

4254.96 --> 4260.4
it becomes blatantly apparent

4258.719 --> 4262.08
when you're faking being a christian and

4260.4 --> 4263.719
you're actually a satanist right

4262.08 --> 4266.08
because it's only needed to be

4263.719 --> 4269.12
superficially interpreted

4266.08 --> 4270.4
to be convincing for the wider public

4269.12 --> 4273.12
and for the media

4270.4 --> 4273.599999999999
but in person you can't fake being a

4273.12 --> 4275.199
christian

4273.6 --> 4277.76
people will pick up on it that you're

4275.199 --> 4280.0
just a liar and you're a pretender

4277.76 --> 4282.4800000000005
that you're actually really dark and

4280.0 --> 4283.04
doing creepy [ __ ] and contradicting

4282.48 --> 4287.839999999999
yours

4283.04 --> 4287.84
what you say with your actions etc etc

4296.32 --> 4304.799999999999
hello h.r fuzzler

4300.88 --> 4307.6
yeah i appreciate that you appreciate me

4304.8 --> 4311.4400000000005
sharing my opinion about it

4307.6 --> 4314.08
i do think about things a lot

4311.44 --> 4316.239
especially when i think i i've caught

4314.08 --> 4319.76
something that nobody's picked up on

4316.239 --> 4321.759999999999
before right i look way through

4319.76 --> 4324.159000000001
i see the things that everybody

4321.76 --> 4329.84
overlooks and it was there all the time

4324.159 --> 4329.839999999999
this is what i like to do

4336.159 --> 4343.839999999999
grayson what

4375.36 --> 4379.5199999999995
no space shuttles are not really missile

4378.8 --> 4385.1990000000005
testing

4379.52 --> 4389.52
that's [ __ ]

4385.199 --> 4394.239
but you could argue that a lot of

4389.52 --> 4394.2390000000005
missile testing is being perhaps done

4395.76 --> 4401.04
with the budget from nasa right

4399.199 --> 4403.44
they might be doing that but the mis

4401.04 --> 4403.44
like the

4404.48 --> 4409.839999999999
space shuttle and rocket launches

4406.4 --> 4412.48
themselves are not missile tests really

4409.84 --> 4413.52
well they might be testing just like

4412.48 --> 4417.04
some

4413.52 --> 4420.96
parts of it that are still part of

4417.04 --> 4422.239
of the scene but it's it's mostly just a

4420.96 --> 4424.88
rocket balloon

4422.239 --> 4427.199
it's just a spectacle it's not like

4424.88 --> 4429.36
gonna double as a missile test because

4427.199 --> 4432.799999999999
missiles were completely different

4429.36 --> 4434.4
missiles go fast have a completely

4432.8 --> 4437.1990000000005
different design

4434.4 --> 4438.0
and if you go to slow rising rocket

4437.199 --> 4440.159
balloon

4438.0 --> 4441.679
how is that gonna yield any kind of

4440.159 --> 4443.28
missile testing data

4441.679 --> 4445.36
it won't because it's a completely

4443.28 --> 4448.239
different setup

4445.36 --> 4449.04
right at best it'll help the some of the

4448.239 --> 4451.44
engine

4449.04 --> 4452.96
elements or something to test that but

4451.44 --> 4456.48
yeah they don't need to

4452.96 --> 4457.52
put that in the rocket in the rocket

4456.48 --> 4459.36
play

4457.52 --> 4461.280000000001
the space shuttle launch thingies they

4459.36 --> 4463.5199999999995
don't need to do that they just

4461.28 --> 4466.32
do it separately ground testing right

4463.52 --> 4466.320000000001
big engines

4466.4 --> 4473.599999999999
just horizontally firing up and all that

4470.239 --> 4475.919999999999
that's where the missile testing missile

4473.6 --> 4477.84
engine testing could

4475.92 --> 4480.4
could be done so they're definitely

4477.84 --> 4483.84
getting something out of it

4480.4 --> 4483.839999999999
it's not just all wasted

4507.199 --> 4525.44
uh no george sanford no you don't

4510.0 --> 4531.04
understand satanism at all

4525.44 --> 4531.04
sonic creations oh my god

4531.92 --> 4536.0
no no

4536.12 --> 4543.199
christianity is not a masonic creation

4539.52 --> 4547.52
this is ridiculous it's pre-masonic

4543.199 --> 4547.5199999999995
masana masons are not that old

4547.679 --> 4551.6
we're secret societies of course

4551.76 --> 4555.84
like the vatican you could say the

4554.96 --> 4559.12
vatican

4555.84 --> 4561.4400000000005
created the the cultural

4559.12 --> 4563.199
christianity the catholicism all that

4561.44 --> 4564.5599999999995
that and the priesthood the concept of

4563.199 --> 4566.4
the priesthood

4564.56 --> 4568.8
right that actually devised christ's

4566.4 --> 4569.199
teachings yeah the vatican came up with

4568.8 --> 4572.56
that

4569.199 --> 4581.839999999999
not freemasons freemasons as much later

4572.56 --> 4581.84
as renaissance era

4585.199 --> 4588.159
this is just wrong

4589.28 --> 4597.84
mason scout back oh sure

4594.32 --> 4601.04
sure they did or

4597.84 --> 4604.56
or the iat64 mason

4601.04 --> 4607.6
simply revived

4604.56 --> 4613.04
part of their system based

4607.6 --> 4613.04
on what was also happening in old egypt

4614.48 --> 4622.32
right because that died they died

4618.0 --> 4625.04
right it stopped now masons will

4622.32 --> 4625.92
probably a lot of them have roots in

4625.04 --> 4628.4
occult

4625.92 --> 4629.04
societies right but the groups of the

4628.4 --> 4632.879999999999
masons

4629.04 --> 4635.28
came later and they they plucked

4632.88 --> 4636.400000000001
things from ancient times of course they

4635.28 --> 4638.239
did right

4636.4 --> 4642.32
does it mean that they were always

4638.239 --> 4642.32
around since then that's nonsense

4646.88 --> 4650.2390000000005
yeah there were always occultists around

4649.04 --> 4652.239
of course

4650.239 --> 4654.4
they've been around since the atlantean

4652.239 --> 4656.879999999999
age right

4654.4 --> 4656.879999999999
called this

4660.719 --> 4665.84
stone mason built up what the hell are

4663.12 --> 4669.84
you blabbering about

4665.84 --> 4669.84
seriously how do you know

4672.4 --> 4679.839999999999
build the pyramids

4687.28 --> 4693.92
really you you think that stonemasons

4690.96 --> 4696.159
can just build the pyramids just like

4693.92 --> 4696.159
that

4703.04 --> 4710.719
yeah that's right whatever

4706.8 --> 4711.84
yeah 7076 masonic order adam waisha yeah

4710.719 --> 4713.76
that's right

4711.84 --> 4716.159000000001
that was the start of the illuminati

4713.76 --> 4716.159000000001
also

4716.56 --> 4721.679
right masons were existed before that

4720.56 --> 4724.88
but again yeah

4721.679 --> 4727.52
renaissance era like kind of like how

4724.88 --> 4728.56
the medieval times you could say that in

4727.52 --> 4730.96
the transition

4728.56 --> 4732.400000000001
between medieval times whatever that was

4730.96 --> 4735.84
it's getting

4732.4 --> 4736.799999999999
complicated and still really but from

4735.84 --> 4738.719
that transition

4736.8 --> 4740.08
that's where the freemasons kind of

4738.719 --> 4742.08
became a

4740.08 --> 4744.8
a uniform organization remember

4742.08 --> 4748.0
originally the masons

4744.8 --> 4751.28
were separatists from theocracy

4748.0 --> 4752.719
church power they were secret they were

4751.28 --> 4755.92
persecuted

4752.719 --> 4759.6
by the church right

4755.92 --> 4762.0
and then the church kind of stopped

4759.6 --> 4766.08
went to heliocentrism and then the

4762.0 --> 4766.08
masons suddenly became bunny buddies

4775.12 --> 4781.28
knight templar is not amazing what the

4777.76 --> 4781.280000000001
hell are you blabbering about

4782.48 --> 4787.199
no they're not they're night templars

4785.28 --> 4790.5599999999995
it's different they're their own order

4787.199 --> 4794.159
they're not masons yeah they had

4790.56 --> 4797.4400000000005
probably lore that was later associated

4794.159 --> 4800.239
with masons they were not masons

4797.44 --> 4801.759999999999
they were night templars they were

4800.239 --> 4804.239
appointed

4801.76 --> 4805.52
by the freaking church they that's where

4804.239 --> 4807.44
they came from and then

4805.52 --> 4808.96
they became too powerful because of

4807.44 --> 4812.799999999999
their separate

4808.96 --> 4815.76
power divine power that was

4812.8 --> 4817.679
claimed and then the church thought like

4815.76 --> 4818.08
yes screw that we want the monopoly back

4817.679 --> 4820.2390000000005
and they

4818.08 --> 4821.679
killed them all right they were not

4820.239 --> 4832.638999999999
masons

4821.679 --> 4834.96
where are you getting this from

4832.639 --> 4838.159000000001
but maybe i'm mistaking it maybe i'm a

4834.96 --> 4838.159
little in over my head it's

4839.92 --> 4849.92
maybe it was an older form of masonry

4847.84 --> 4851.84
again but yeah i wouldn't really call it

4849.92 --> 4853.76
masons i would just call it occult

4851.84 --> 4858.159000000001
societies

4853.76 --> 4861.4400000000005
of which later the masons basically

4858.159 --> 4864.32
grabbed it to form the modern

4861.44 --> 4864.32
freemasonry

4868.4 --> 4872.5599999999995
i would if you're going to just say that

4870.4 --> 4875.36
just like that night templars

4872.56 --> 4876.2390000000005
which is masons right that's such an

4875.36 --> 4878.719
overt

4876.239 --> 4881.28
claim if you're gonna say that i'd like

4878.719 --> 4885.28
to actually

4881.28 --> 4886.0
see the well some kind of historical

4885.28 --> 4889.759999999999
reference like

4886.0 --> 4891.12
imagery which definitively proves that

4889.76 --> 4893.4400000000005
they're masons right

4891.12 --> 4894.639
through their imagery which is typically

4893.44 --> 4897.44
how masons

4894.639 --> 4898.4800000000005
like had were be were able to be

4897.44 --> 4902.159
identified

4898.48 --> 4905.599999999999
covertly before it was all widely known

4902.159 --> 4908.719
those symbols right yeah

4905.6 --> 4911.360000000001
night templar is a masonic degree

4908.719 --> 4912.4800000000005
oh that means the night templars are

4911.36 --> 4915.5199999999995
masons or

4912.48 --> 4918.08
again they simply use

4915.52 --> 4919.040000000001
the night templar occult knowledge and

4918.08 --> 4922.159
grafted it

4919.04 --> 4926.08
into their system and then made a

4922.159 --> 4929.44
night templar degree come on

4926.08 --> 4932.8
think about it jesus christ

4929.44 --> 4935.839999999999
get some cohesion in there

4932.8 --> 4937.84
stop just blabbering just

4935.84 --> 4941.1990000000005
blurting out all these things and then

4937.84 --> 4943.04
things oh that's all causally related oh

4941.199 --> 4945.839999999999
no would you think about what you're

4943.04 --> 4945.84
saying

4951.36 --> 4959.839999999999
show me the evidence

4971.28 --> 4976.48
knights of templar the knights templar

4978.0 --> 4990.8
but is that the old the old one

4987.679 --> 4990.8
fraternal order

4992.719 --> 4998.2390000000005
of jerusalem palestine rhodes and malta

4995.84 --> 4998.2390000000005
right

4998.84 --> 5001.84
hmm

5016.56 --> 5023.04
amazing okay okay well look

5020.56 --> 5023.84
at least you're now actually rolling in

5023.04 --> 5027.04
some more

5023.84 --> 5030.56
tangible references

5027.04 --> 5034.4
maybe i was wrong maybe freemasons

5030.56 --> 5038.400000000001
exactly that order as the modern

5034.4 --> 5040.879999999999
is does go back that far

5038.4 --> 5042.32
but if they did it was all occulted it

5040.88 --> 5045.84
was all secret

5042.32 --> 5057.84
because they opposed the church and like

5045.84 --> 5057.84
they didn't want the church to find out

5068.84 --> 5071.84
ah

5075.12 --> 5078.4
[ __ ] mason success ignoring king james

5077.92 --> 5084.56
rome

5078.4 --> 5087.199
empire what

5084.56 --> 5089.4400000000005
but is that the same though is it

5087.199 --> 5092.638999999999
literally the same

5089.44 --> 5098.799999999999
or is that more of a literal mason

5092.639 --> 5101.76
right needs some clarity about this

5098.8 --> 5102.320000000001
like maybe again it might have been

5101.76 --> 5104.320000000001
correct

5102.32 --> 5105.92
after all that maybe there were like

5104.32 --> 5108.639
masons

5105.92 --> 5109.76
but are they literally the same

5108.639 --> 5112.4800000000005
organization

5109.76 --> 5114.639
is like the organization thousands of

5112.48 --> 5118.239
years old or is it

5114.639 --> 5122.56
a reformation a new

5118.239 --> 5124.638999999999
group that's very close to how the older

5122.56 --> 5141.84
ones function

5124.639 --> 5141.84
it yeah which is it right

5148.239 --> 5158.5599999999995
accepted scottish right free masonry

5154.48 --> 5158.5599999999995
okay well i'm in over my head here

5159.84 --> 5164.96
with this yeah i have to admit like i'm

5165.52 --> 5170.4800000000005
i don't know enough to make a judge

5168.8 --> 5172.320000000001
maybe i was wrong maybe they've been

5170.48 --> 5174.959999999999
there [ __ ] forever

5172.32 --> 5176.48

5178.88 --> 5184.0

5180.84 --> 5186.159000000001
symbols exactly like that for thousands

5184.0 --> 5189.6
of years

5186.159 --> 5192.719
have i seen the actual evidence for this

5189.6 --> 5197.84
no so yeah maybe

5192.719 --> 5197.84
i judged it wrong

5198.0 --> 5204.56
fine okay freemasons rule the world they

5201.04 --> 5205.36
are your gods freemasons are your gods

5204.56 --> 5207.1990000000005

5552.8 --> 5556.4800000000005
technological secrets and mind control

right and then they also

5571.679 --> 5577.76
try to have some overweight throughout

5574.0 --> 5580.639
history a fractal pattern insert

5577.76 --> 5582.4800000000005
bluffing to everybody that they are the

5580.639 --> 5584.159000000001
controllers because they had been

5582.48 --> 5585.599999999999
appointed every time because they could

5584.159 --> 5588.239
actually get stuff done

5585.6 --> 5589.04
right by the controllers but then in

5588.239 --> 5591.839999999999
their

5589.04 --> 5593.679
storytelling they turn it around no they

5591.84 --> 5596.8
are the secret controllers and they are

5593.679 --> 5598.96
using the powers that be as a shield to

5596.8 --> 5602.400000000001
stay in the shadows yeah yeah

5598.96 --> 5605.679
i know how that trick works i know that

5602.4 --> 5609.28
from personal experience yeah

5605.679 --> 5609.28
most of it is mind control

5609.92 --> 5616.2390000000005
making you think what they want you to

5613.6 --> 5619.52
think about it

5616.239 --> 5622.48
through inherent psychological design

5619.52 --> 5623.040000000001
realizations just knowing how people

5622.48 --> 5626.718999999999
think

5623.04 --> 5630.239
how they function what they want

5626.719 --> 5632.56
in their thinking freemasons have study

5630.239 --> 5632.5599999999995
of that

5638.96 --> 5645.12
uh guns have never owned form of d oh

5642.08 --> 5647.199
maybe i think d d was created by

5645.12 --> 5649.599999999999
freemasons

5647.199 --> 5651.678999999999
wizards of the coast pretty damn

5649.6 --> 5654.08
freemason

5651.679 --> 5656.4800000000005
but that's fine like i actually

5654.08 --> 5659.44
appreciate freemasons because at least

5656.48 --> 5661.04
they get things now what they do with

5659.44 --> 5665.919999999999
those things

5661.04 --> 5668.08
yeah not not good necessarily or

5665.92 --> 5669.679
but it's not exclusively evil or

5668.08 --> 5673.84
anything right it's just

5669.679 --> 5673.84
a lot of shady [ __ ] going around

5674.0 --> 5680.08
but at least they get things

5677.76 --> 5682.400000000001
they get designed they get fractal

5680.08 --> 5686.08
thinking a few of them do

5682.4 --> 5686.638999999999
right so they can actually design with

5686.08 --> 5689.28
that

5686.639 --> 5690.159000000001
which makes those designs stand the test

5689.28 --> 5692.8
the time

5690.159 --> 5693.679
whether it is psychological design or

5692.8 --> 5696.96
whether it is

5693.679 --> 5700.0
physical design so

5696.96 --> 5702.159
yeah in a way i do respect them

5700.0 --> 5703.679
for their quality it's just that their

5702.159 --> 5707.28
spirit

5703.679 --> 5707.28
is not the best the guides

5709.92 --> 5715.84
what are you talking about

5717.36 --> 5722.159
there we go again the eye they build the

5720.719 --> 5724.08
kings again yeah see

5722.159 --> 5725.839999999999
that's exactly what i meant you're

5724.08 --> 5729.84
squirting

5725.84 --> 5729.84
you're playing into their mind trick

5765.52 --> 5769.52
now i think clutch bear is talking about

5767.679 --> 5771.36
that they don't appreciate

5769.52 --> 5773.040000000001
in some circles freemason they don't

5771.36 --> 5776.239
appreciate talking about

5773.04 --> 5779.679
jesus and that is true though because

5776.239 --> 5781.0
this is just unfortunate truth there is

5779.679 --> 5784.159
like a

5781.0 --> 5787.36
luciferianism within the

5784.159 --> 5791.04
deeper occult belief structure

5787.36 --> 5791.04
of freemasons it is there

5791.199 --> 5795.5199999999995
where they actually try to turn things

5793.119 --> 5798.32
around and just say no lucifer is the

5795.52 --> 5801.84
good one and

5798.32 --> 5803.36
jesus is just a distraction right

5801.84 --> 5805.4400000000005
but that doesn't mean that all

5803.36 --> 5806.48
freemasons are that you gotta have the

5805.44 --> 5809.36
cure you gotta be

5806.48 --> 5811.44
lured into that or have the curiosity to

5809.36 --> 5814.799999999999
find that or to find that out

5811.44 --> 5817.759999999999
because a lot of freemasons that aren't

5814.8 --> 5818.719
all that sunken that deep you could say

5817.76 --> 5821.280000000001
into the

5818.719 --> 5822.4
into the hierarchy they're just

5821.28 --> 5826.159
christians

5822.4 --> 5828.5599999999995
very decent people

5826.159 --> 5829.92
and some of them are shady not so decent

5828.56 --> 5833.52
people so it's

5829.92 --> 5836.32
look it's all kinds

5833.52 --> 5841.84
it's very compartmentalized the

5836.32 --> 5841.84
organizations are very compartmentalized

5884.32 --> 5886.639
hmm

5889.76 --> 5893.52
okay moth eyes philanthropic fraternity

5892.88 --> 5896.96
sounds

5893.52 --> 5898.88
very dubious but yeah my grand

5896.96 --> 5900.2390000000005
dad from my mother's side was also a

5898.88 --> 5903.4400000000005
freemason

5900.239 --> 5905.839999999999
i'd never actually met him when he was

5903.44 --> 5905.839999999999
alive

5907.679 --> 5915.119
he withheld himself

5911.28 --> 5917.199
from yeah my mother and my aunts

5915.119 --> 5920.719
after they were five for some weird

5917.199 --> 5922.5599999999995
reason never even knew why

5920.719 --> 5925.92
so he might have been up to some weird

5922.56 --> 5928.639
shady [ __ ] i don't know if he was

5925.92 --> 5929.1990000000005
but he seemed to be a very decent person

5928.639 --> 5932.32
it's

5929.199 --> 5934.08
probably more due to ego issues he

5932.32 --> 5939.84
probably had some

5934.08 --> 5939.84
yeah unresolved gamma problems that yeah

5976.32 --> 5980.08
now living on a flat blade sounds more

5979.28 --> 5983.599999999999
like sushi

5980.08 --> 5986.159
but that that's might be me it says

5983.6 --> 5990.159000000001
success now it says

5986.159 --> 5990.159
doesn't it says suse

5991.04 --> 5994.88
now if you're like hispanic and you're

5994.0 --> 5998.08
really

5994.88 --> 5999.119
really poor at speaking english then so

5998.08 --> 6001.679
say

5999.119 --> 6002.5599999999995
yeah you could interpret that as success

6001.679 --> 6009.84
but that's

6002.56 --> 6009.84
kind of stretching it

6020.84 --> 6040.0
yeah whatever

6036.0 --> 6043.92
oh well i didn't know that

6040.0 --> 6046.08
his name was ceases

6043.92 --> 6048.0
sorry no you're just wrong you're

6046.08 --> 6050.239
stretching it this is pha

6048.0 --> 6065.84
level of thinking i wouldn't go there if

6050.239 --> 6065.839999999999
i were you already

6098.0 --> 6104.4
simple no no no no i read this ah

6101.119 --> 6107.119
no it's not simple

6104.4 --> 6110.239
it's just that you're wrong and you're

6107.119 --> 6110.239
stretching things

6118.0 --> 6121.44
so what's next you're going gonna apply

6119.44 --> 6123.119
gematria to it or something and then

6121.44 --> 6126.159
[ __ ] around with that no why don't you

6123.119 --> 6130.799999999999
stop wasting everybody's time

6126.159 --> 6130.799999999999
jesus backwards does not spell success

6130.88 --> 6136.0
however in reality following jesus's

6134.239 --> 6137.919999999999
advice and his words in his train of

6136.0 --> 6141.52
thinking and his methods

6137.92 --> 6144.56
does actually bring success if you can

6141.52 --> 6146.56
stand the challenge of it right

6144.56 --> 6149.04
so practically yeah it does bring

6146.56 --> 6153.360000000001
success has nothing to do with his

6149.04 --> 6153.36
name spelled backwards though

6155.199 --> 6160.08
right i'm gonna round out the show so

6158.0 --> 6160.88
thanks everybody for coming i hope you

6160.08 --> 6162.639
liked this show

6160.88 --> 6164.32
it was kind of all over the place

6162.639 --> 6165.28
especially the last part i might have

6164.32 --> 6167.199
said

6165.28 --> 6168.96
some incorrect statements about

6167.199 --> 6170.879999999999
freemasonry

6168.96 --> 6172.4
but yeah the whole thing is just so

6170.88 --> 6176.400000000001
fuzzy and

6172.4 --> 6179.599999999999
and difficult and they are like kind of

6176.4 --> 6182.879999999999
notorious to try and [ __ ] around

6179.6 --> 6186.08
with ideas and and

6182.88 --> 6190.0
be less than genuine

6186.08 --> 6192.639
about history it's difficult

6190.0 --> 6193.6
so i don't think they're that old but

6192.639 --> 6196.32
their roots

6193.6 --> 6196.719
are everywhere they've taken information

6196.32 --> 6199.759999999999
from

6196.719 --> 6201.52
almost every thing out there

6199.76 --> 6203.119000000001
it's like they gathered it they just

6201.52 --> 6206.080000000001
reeled it in and built

6203.119 --> 6207.759999999999
the new thing with it the freemasonry

6206.08 --> 6210.4
the modern freemasonry from the

6207.76 --> 6210.400000000001
renaissance

6212.08 --> 6217.119
but anyway if you like this show then

6215.04 --> 6218.239

doing well

6252.56 --> 6256.56
enjoying springtime and i hope all of

6255.36 --> 6260.4
you are

6256.56 --> 6262.2390000000005
don't get obsessed with shadowy groups

6260.4 --> 6264.879999999999
of any sort because you

6262.239 --> 6265.36
in your mind will start to amplify their

6264.88 --> 6267.52
power

6265.36 --> 6270.48
put them on a pedestal and then start

6267.52 --> 6273.76
shaking right that's gamma behavior

6270.48 --> 6277.678999999999
that's creating like a devil to make you

6273.76 --> 6279.4400000000005
scared and powerless so you're you're

6277.679 --> 6281.92
initiating a process of putting

6279.44 --> 6285.119
something dark on a pedestal

6281.92 --> 6288.639
so that you become unable

6285.119 --> 6289.92
to act you use it as an excuse not to

6288.639 --> 6293.1990000000005
act and that's why i

6289.92 --> 6296.56
i am against doing that don't

6293.199 --> 6298.159
amplify the power of dark things

6296.56 --> 6301.04
dark groups don't ever do that to

6298.159 --> 6304.48
yourself it's a bad habit

6301.04 --> 6308.159
and it makes you weak it does

6304.48 --> 6313.04
right anyway i will be back tomorrow

6308.159 --> 6316.32
with flat earth early bird number 906

6313.04 --> 6317.44
uh and yeah i hope to see you around in

6316.32 --> 6331.84
chats

6317.44 --> 6331.839999999999
until the next video keep it flat

6332.7 --> 6353.7789999999995
[Music]

6371.199 --> 6373.28
you
