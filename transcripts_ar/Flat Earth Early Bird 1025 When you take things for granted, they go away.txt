that will be much appreciated

83.6 --> 87.52
so yeah the weather today is

89.52 --> 93.03999999999999
not as it was yesterday

96.159 --> 99.2
it's

97.119 --> 102.72
very much cloud cover

99.2 --> 104.24000000000001
and stormy

102.72 --> 107.36
i think it's probably gonna rain here

104.24 --> 110.479
and there as well seen some droplets but

107.36 --> 110.479
yeah not real rain

111.439 --> 116.32
uh yeah i think it also cooled down a

113.439 --> 119.27999999999999
bit not too dramatically

116.32 --> 121.83999999999999
like yesterday it was

119.28 --> 123.92
a bizarre kind of

121.84 --> 126.799
warm brewish weather

123.92 --> 128.56
like even into the evening this is just

126.799 --> 131.84
very odd

128.56 --> 131.84
but that's changing around

135.76 --> 142.2
so yeah

137.92 --> 142.2
feels like autumn is coming

142.8 --> 147.28
i think i'm also starting to see the the

145.36 --> 148.4
color the slight color

147.28 --> 151.12
changes

148.4 --> 151.12
of the leaves

163.28 --> 169.36
hello

164.8 --> 169.36
cleary first in chat pj crew shank

169.599 --> 172.319
good to see you

175.04 --> 181.959
it is monday the 27th

178.0 --> 181.959
of september 2021

187.04 --> 189.28
and

190.56 --> 195.44
this could be either a very short show

192.8 --> 199.84
or a very long show

195.44 --> 199.84
because nathan's not doing a live show

204.48 --> 210.879
for some reason hasn't said why

208.0 --> 214.72
but yeah so

210.879 --> 214.72
no live flight earth debates today

215.599 --> 219.2
which means that at some point i'm

217.36 --> 222.64000000000001
probably gonna have to deal with all the

219.2 --> 222.64
trolls that are gonna be bored

223.76 --> 226.76
uh

261.359 --> 263.68
hmm

266.96 --> 273.52
yeah it could be pj krishan

270.0 --> 276.32
and hey he's really into it so

273.52 --> 279.919
he's got the youtuber skills he's got

276.32 --> 281.919
the professional interest

279.919 --> 283.919
it's not strange that he just kind of

281.919 --> 285.919
like is breaking away and starting to do

283.919 --> 287.919
that because that's just probably

285.919 --> 288.96
something he secretly wanted for a long

287.919 --> 290.56
time

288.96 --> 293.56
inside so

290.56 --> 293.56
yeah

312.32 --> 318.15999999999997
ah yeah yeah seeking star wars hello

315.12 --> 318.16
yeah i got your email

319.6 --> 324.56
yeah that was a very beautiful picture

321.199 --> 328.039
too bad there was like a window great

324.56 --> 328.039
in front of it

359.6 --> 365.0
right

361.12 --> 365.0
yeah beautiful sightings

366.16 --> 369.199
slow mo moon buggy

369.44 --> 375.039
what channel are the tutorials i think

371.919 --> 376.0
it's just nathan oakley

375.039 --> 378.479
it's just

376.0 --> 380.96
gonna get another subject that he also

378.479 --> 383.28
then does on that channel

380.96 --> 383.28
right

386.96 --> 393.88
right so yeah yesterday

389.28 --> 393.88
pretty heavy day in ways

395.919 --> 398.88
a little tense

399.52 --> 405.35999999999996
it was weird i watched back

402.72 --> 408.36
the series that i was so enthusiastic

405.36 --> 408.36
about

408.8 --> 413.759
and that was really odd

411.12 --> 415.12
seeing it back because the second time i

413.759 --> 416.639
watched it

415.12 --> 420.28000000000003
it made a completely different

416.639 --> 420.28000000000003
impression on me

425.28 --> 429.67999999999995
and it's just

426.479 --> 432.4
very weird to realize that

429.68 --> 435.12
it like it really had like this magic to

432.4 --> 437.52
it the first time i saw it

435.12 --> 441.039
because

437.52 --> 442.96
also because of the quickness and

441.039 --> 445.44
the focused

442.96 --> 445.44
acting

445.919 --> 449.44
right

447.039 --> 452.0
and the quickness of it and then

449.44 --> 454.479
it kind of rushes past your normal

452.0 --> 456.72
attention

454.479 --> 458.15999999999997
and that and it makes it work your mind

456.72 --> 460.72
makes it work

458.16 --> 462.47900000000004
it's movie magic but now the second time

460.72 --> 464.879
that i watched it

462.479 --> 468.4
i was much more analytical

464.879 --> 470.16
as to what i was looking at instead of

468.4 --> 471.75899999999996
being very suspended in what's going to

470.16 --> 473.84000000000003
happen next

471.759 --> 476.639
and it was a very different experience

473.84 --> 476.63899999999995
it's odd

477.599 --> 480.8
still interesting

485.28 --> 491.52
rectifier okay clearly

488.479 --> 494.71999999999997
yeah i was talking about a tropa

491.52 --> 494.71999999999997
on the dust channel

496.96 --> 501.28
super

498.24 --> 501.28000000000003
heavy sci-fi

502.24 --> 507.599
this is super heavy now it's it's kind

504.319 --> 509.599
of like proper sci-fi in a way it's very

507.599 --> 511.84
consistent like

509.599 --> 515.76
what's happening there could potentially

511.84 --> 517.5989999999999
fit in multiple sci-fi universes

515.76 --> 520.399
like i could almost imagine that it

517.599 --> 522.32
would fit in the babylon

520.399 --> 525.44
universe although you don't see any

522.32 --> 527.6800000000001
aliens in in this specific skit

525.44 --> 527.6800000000001
or

527.839 --> 530.6400000000001
or even the star trek universe some of

529.92 --> 532.24
the

530.64 --> 535.24
like they even talk about space-time

532.24 --> 535.24
continuum

537.12 --> 540.399
right

538.32 --> 543.36
so it's like this series could

540.399 --> 546.08
potentially fit in many different sci-fi

543.36 --> 548.399
universes and that

546.08 --> 550.48
and that is kind of special

548.399 --> 552.32
about it

550.48 --> 554.24
and i think that they attempt that with

552.32 --> 557.09
a lot of different movies on that

554.24 --> 560.0
channel like that's their thing

557.09 --> 560.88
[Music]

560.0 --> 563.76
like

560.88 --> 566.88
compatible sci-fi

563.76 --> 570.24
very interesting

566.88 --> 572.48
as a concept as an art concept anyway

570.24 --> 572.48
uh

574.24 --> 578.24
but yeah the second time i watched

576.0 --> 580.24
entropa it had a completely different

578.24 --> 582.9590000000001
impression on me when it was much more

580.24 --> 582.9590000000001
analytical

583.12 --> 587.92
and also some of the

585.68 --> 591.399
the cheaper parts did stand out a little

587.92 --> 591.399
more it is

593.2 --> 597.0400000000001
still just

595.04 --> 599.5999999999999
good

597.04 --> 601.12
in a way very sim that's also part of

599.6 --> 603.6800000000001
what reminded me

601.12 --> 606.48
reminded it to me about babylon 5

603.68 --> 609.04
because babylon 5 was also kind of like

606.48 --> 612.88
a cheap setup in a way

609.04 --> 612.88
but because of the character and

613.04 --> 617.12
like a very long-running

615.76 --> 619.519
story and

617.12 --> 622.399
still good enough music some like

619.519 --> 624.24
intense moments good music in casual

622.399 --> 627.12
moments not so good music in babylon

624.24 --> 629.04
five and that really pulled you through

627.12 --> 631.2
when when you just looked at what you're

629.04 --> 635.36
looking at separately then it's like you

631.2 --> 635.36
see that it in ways it is kind of cheap

636.0 --> 640.399
but still works great it's like good

638.399 --> 641.279
enough

640.399 --> 643.519
and

641.279 --> 647.279
i got that sense from this

643.519 --> 650.16
little mini series too but yeah they do

647.279 --> 651.6
have like really proper application of

650.16 --> 652.399
cgi

651.6 --> 654.24
like

652.399 --> 657.04
very

654.24 --> 660.399
sci-fi high-tech feeling but not like a

657.04 --> 662.959
cluster screw like not like too much

660.399 --> 666.64
at all like not at all

662.959 --> 666.64
but still they do apply

667.12 --> 670.399
that sci-fi

668.56 --> 672.16
cgi

670.399 --> 673.36
yeah i don't know

672.16 --> 676.079
anyways

673.36 --> 676.0790000000001
let's move on

683.04 --> 685.76
what's this

687.68 --> 694.12
now i've got to to what

690.72 --> 694.12
hello mandio

703.36 --> 708.72
right so yeah after that i also had a

705.839 --> 712.24
call with a friend of mine a friend of

708.72 --> 712.24
mine my friend in name

712.72 --> 716.32
who had like

714.399 --> 718.88
three and a half hour stuff to get off

716.32 --> 718.88
her chest

723.36 --> 728.2
and i think some of it might have rubbed

724.959 --> 728.1999999999999
off a little

734.48 --> 739.279
looks like it's sweater

736.56 --> 739.279
weather again

747.279 --> 752.8
nah i think like you could probably do

750.48 --> 754.5600000000001
without

752.8 --> 758.4399999999999
but right now i feel like wearing a

754.56 --> 758.4399999999999
sweater sweater

769.44 --> 773.32
okay bj krushank

787.47 --> 790.609
[Music]

794.24 --> 797.24
so

807.279 --> 810.92
what else is happening

815.47 --> 819.82
[Music]

826.56 --> 829.56
so

838.24 --> 843.72
yeah not much really was happening

840.0 --> 843.72
yesterday overall

848.959 --> 852.079
it's remarkably

852.399 --> 857.199
uninteresting

854.88 --> 859.279
even jim bob had like a video it was

857.199 --> 860.8
just like oh here's a snippet of

859.279 --> 862.639
something that's on the behind the

860.8 --> 867.959
paywall

862.639 --> 867.9590000000001
so it's a worthwhile payroll i guess

873.12 --> 876.12
uh

896.32 --> 899.839
yeah i think so too

900.8 --> 905.5999999999999
or somebody that's just

903.36 --> 907.279
kind of snapped i don't know i get that

905.6 --> 909.76
that sort of thing happens during this

907.279 --> 909.76
time too

910.32 --> 913.32
right

913.519 --> 919.04
that's why i had to uh

916.72 --> 920.88
play psychology or

919.04 --> 924.56
it was an honor though

920.88 --> 924.56
for my friends basically

924.639 --> 932.16
trying to get rid of somebody that's

927.68 --> 935.12
literally just diving into the black

932.16 --> 938.56
completely sacrificing his dignity like

935.12 --> 942.48
that guy could literally be

938.56 --> 942.4799999999999
like a fundy of some kind

945.36 --> 949.759
but yeah mainly he's an alcoholic

950.32 --> 954.72
one of the really bad kinds not

952.56 --> 956.2399999999999
necessarily violent kinds but the ones

954.72 --> 960.48
that become

956.24 --> 961.6800000000001
like super neglected and and careless

960.48 --> 964.72
terrible

961.68 --> 967.5999999999999
especially if you're a sensitive person

964.72 --> 971.519
to have to deal with that

967.6 --> 971.519
now i warned her at the start

971.92 --> 976.079
and she actually listened but she was

974.16 --> 978.16
basically complaining to me like why

976.079 --> 983.56
were you right damn it

978.16 --> 983.56
why couldn't this just actually work out

986.079 --> 990.12
and i had no answer for that

997.92 --> 1000.24
all right

1002.48 --> 1006.8000000000001
hey dusty ryder

1004.56 --> 1009.8
just left the dentist a root canal oh

1006.8 --> 1009.8
jesus

1010.32 --> 1014.639
dentist

1012.48 --> 1017.839
man

1014.639 --> 1020.16
now i've been getting also more issues

1017.839 --> 1022.5600000000001
though there's no consistent pain issues

1020.16 --> 1022.56
at least

1023.04 --> 1027.52
it's like i don't know what's going on

1024.72 --> 1027.52
there sometimes

1029.52 --> 1035.12
hey at least i can still eat

1032.16 --> 1037.039
actually much better than in a long time

1035.12 --> 1039.4389999999999
right so i have to be empirical just

1037.039 --> 1041.76
because i feel something is a nuisance

1039.439 --> 1045.039
doesn't mean it is like the practical

1041.76 --> 1045.039
results have to prove that

1047.28 --> 1052.3999999999999
so as long as i don't end up in some

1049.12 --> 1054.3999999999999
ever increasing pain situation i'm good

1052.4 --> 1057.2
and i haven't and i've been very careful

1054.4 --> 1057.2
to avoid that

1060.0 --> 1063.12
it's like

1061.039 --> 1065.2
seriously i don't know what i i would

1063.12 --> 1066.6399999999999
have done if i wasn't like an effective

1065.2 --> 1069.2
healer

1066.64 --> 1072.44
if i didn't have those skills i would be

1069.2 --> 1072.44
so screwed

1112.16 --> 1114.48
right

1114.64 --> 1117.5200000000002
so yeah guys

1121.28 --> 1123.84
i'm here

1149.52 --> 1154.8799999999999
i mean is this just like a muddy day

1151.76 --> 1157.12
everybody's stuck in the mud like me

1154.88 --> 1160.44
or

1157.12 --> 1160.4399999999998
i don't know

1167.28 --> 1170.6399999999999
not literally stuck in the mud by the

1168.96 --> 1173.28
way but

1170.64 --> 1173.2800000000002
it's just like

1174.799 --> 1177.799
foggy

1184.48 --> 1189.52
i had yeah the confession time i had the

1187.52 --> 1190.559
moment today

1189.52 --> 1192.72
is it now

1190.559 --> 1195.2
two hours ago where i actually was

1192.72 --> 1197.6000000000001
literally just

1195.2 --> 1200.96
made yeah pushing myself to decide to

1197.6 --> 1200.9599999999998
make this the last show

1202.159 --> 1204.88
it's

1202.96 --> 1207.8400000000001
not a very

1204.88 --> 1210.64
realistic kind of decision but it's like

1207.84 --> 1213.36
there are things

1210.64 --> 1215.6000000000001
that are so difficult to explain like i

1213.36 --> 1216.799
can't even explain why i'm frustrated

1215.6 --> 1219.1999999999998
really

1216.799 --> 1223.9189999999999
but yeah

1219.2 --> 1223.919
a lot of it has to do with the finances

1224.0 --> 1226.4
and

1226.72 --> 1231.1200000000001
i don't even fully have an oversight

1229.12 --> 1233.12
even on the energetic level like how

1231.12 --> 1236.1589999999999
that works

1233.12 --> 1239.9189999999999
i'm really i'm disconnected from money

1236.159 --> 1242.4
inside in ways i really am

1239.919 --> 1243.6000000000001
even though i look very

1242.4 --> 1246.96
deeply

1243.6 --> 1246.9599999999998
those that part

1247.28 --> 1252.32
i i white-noised it

1250.0 --> 1252.32
and

1253.039 --> 1256.64
i'm

1254.0 --> 1258.64
terrified to undo it

1256.64 --> 1262.919
terrified to be able to understand it

1258.64 --> 1262.919
again completely because

1266.32 --> 1270.6399999999999
because of previous times when i tried

1268.4 --> 1270.64
that

1271.679 --> 1277.679
and what it did to me anyway

1274.4 --> 1280.24
it's not really open for discussion

1277.679 --> 1281.76
how i conduct myself

1280.24 --> 1284.0
like that

1281.76 --> 1284.0
but

1284.24 --> 1288.48
yeah i get a lot of compliments from

1286.159 --> 1292.0800000000002
people okay and

1288.48 --> 1294.64
they feel heartfelt

1292.08 --> 1296.799
honest like people do appreciate me and

1294.64 --> 1300.0
what i do here

1296.799 --> 1300.0
but at the same time

1302.32 --> 1307.36
it's not the same vibe i get

1305.12 --> 1310.08
with a lot of other channels that do

1307.36 --> 1310.08
other things

1310.96 --> 1315.6000000000001
there are other people

1313.36 --> 1319.76
and sometimes i feel like

1315.6 --> 1322.0
what the hell am i even doing here like

1319.76 --> 1323.2
i don't know how to place myself in

1322.0 --> 1327.2
between

1323.2 --> 1329.8400000000001
other people even on the internet

1327.2 --> 1333.8400000000001
like what am i

1329.84 --> 1333.84
what is this what am i actually doing

1338.72 --> 1342.24
i mean

1339.6 --> 1345.12
it's like yeah theoretics when i'm in a

1342.24 --> 1348.0
good mood when i'm not distracted

1345.12 --> 1351.52
but then i have an overlook

1348.0 --> 1354.4
and i compare myself to other channels

1351.52 --> 1354.4
and it's just like

1356.4 --> 1362.24
i can't blame this on algorithmics

1359.84 --> 1362.24
anymore

1362.96 --> 1369.44
people know me

1365.36 --> 1369.4399999999998
i can't blame this on algorithmics

1372.159 --> 1379.0390000000002
for some reason my support is

1376.72 --> 1382.24
like compared to others

1379.039 --> 1382.24
and i hate to do that

1383.44 --> 1388.96
i just feel kind of underappreciated

1386.159 --> 1390.24
even though people verbally and even in

1388.96 --> 1393.44
energy

1390.24 --> 1395.679
give me recognition do give me

1393.44 --> 1398.0800000000002
a sense that i am doing it for something

1395.679 --> 1399.679
it's just that

1398.08 --> 1402.6789999999999
there's this weird

1399.679 --> 1402.679
disconnect

1404.24 --> 1408.48
and i don't know what to how to deal

1406.08 --> 1408.48
with this

1414.88 --> 1419.2800000000002
i've been at it for three years

1417.84 --> 1422.24
every day

1419.28 --> 1424.559
contributed quite a lot

1422.24 --> 1426.799
and also probably wasted a whole bunch

1424.559 --> 1429.039
of people's their time

1426.799 --> 1431.2
because it was just dealing in subjects

1429.039 --> 1434.799
and the responses to subjects that they

1431.2 --> 1434.799
absolutely cannot deal with

1436.48 --> 1440.48
and then again

1438.0 --> 1443.12
from in the shadows i get like very

1440.48 --> 1444.88
enthusiastic responses almost like size

1443.12 --> 1446.799
of relief

1444.88 --> 1449.0390000000002
for what i'm doing

1446.799 --> 1451.76
but then

1449.039 --> 1451.76
in the field

1456.72 --> 1462.72
like th this is not it's financially

1459.52 --> 1462.72
this is not working out

1463.44 --> 1469.24
i can't i can't

1465.36 --> 1469.24
keep going like this

1474.96 --> 1478.559
and i feel embarrassed about it

1480.4 --> 1484.24
and i'm embarrassed to bring it up every

1482.72 --> 1487.2
single time

1484.24 --> 1488.96
now

1487.2 --> 1491.039
i'm less embarrassed when it actually

1488.96 --> 1494.32
works in the times when

1491.039 --> 1496.0
dude people have bombed me with

1494.32 --> 1498.72
finances that

1496.0 --> 1499.76
defied my imagination

1498.72 --> 1501.84
and that

1499.76 --> 1503.6
just was fantastic

1501.84 --> 1506.0
did a lot of good

1503.6 --> 1508.08
and now it seems for a while it's all

1506.0 --> 1512.36
just rolling down and

1508.08 --> 1512.36
i can't really place it

1515.279 --> 1518.24
ah thank you for that

1522.559 --> 1528.96
yeah no you didn't even actually have to

1524.64 --> 1532.24
delete that because it is true

1528.96 --> 1534.24
but it's not really threatening

1532.24 --> 1535.279
i'm just trying to be honest about an

1534.24 --> 1537.919
honest

1535.279 --> 1540.0
thing that i feel

1537.919 --> 1541.1200000000001
it's just about honesty

1540.0 --> 1542.72
you know i

1541.12 --> 1543.76
i don't

1542.72 --> 1545.84
want

1543.76 --> 1549.84
to stop doing this

1545.84 --> 1552.3999999999999
i'm not making an excuse to stop this no

1549.84 --> 1555.1999999999998
this is almost feeling like a

1552.4 --> 1557.76
breakup situation

1555.2 --> 1560.559
when i'm still very fond of the person

1557.76 --> 1561.44
i'm in a relationship with

1560.559 --> 1565.12
right

1561.44 --> 1570.44
maybe not smitten anymore but that's

1565.12 --> 1570.4399999999998
[ __ ] that's that's just the beginning

1572.64 --> 1580.0800000000002
so yeah this is serious i need financial

1576.08 --> 1583.3
support guys i i don't wanna

1580.08 --> 1583.3
[Music]

1585.039 --> 1588.72
don't want to keep repeating myself

1591.12 --> 1594.32
what would i do instead

1596.08 --> 1600.799
i would run into a whole bunch of new

1598.559 --> 1603.2
obstacles that would be extremely

1600.799 --> 1605.76
straining probably erase

1603.2 --> 1607.039
half of my mind

1605.76 --> 1609.279
and

1607.039 --> 1611.76
which doesn't necessarily have to be a

1609.279 --> 1613.36
bad thing you know i've been doing this

1611.76 --> 1617.76
process

1613.36 --> 1617.76
for so long maybe it has been too long

1618.48 --> 1621.919
maybe i've just doing been doing this

1620.4 --> 1625.2
for too long i haven't been taking

1621.919 --> 1627.8400000000001
vacations people like at all you might

1625.2 --> 1629.8400000000001
have taken notice of that like at all

1627.84 --> 1631.36
so maybe i've just been doing this too

1629.84 --> 1634.9599999999998
long

1631.36 --> 1634.9599999999998
it's just i don't want to stop

1637.679 --> 1642.159
it's like parts of it are working and

1640.32 --> 1645.2
are growing

1642.159 --> 1646.0
i am performing

1645.2 --> 1648.48
but

1646.0 --> 1649.36
other parts is just like no it seems to

1648.48 --> 1651.44
like

1649.36 --> 1655.0
be dying down almost i don't know what

1651.44 --> 1655.0
to do about this

1660.08 --> 1665.279
yeah just take a break and what's that

1662.08 --> 1665.279
gonna do dusty ryder

1665.679 --> 1668.72
is that

1666.64 --> 1671.76
gonna stop making me head for

1668.72 --> 1672.72
destitution taking a break

1671.76 --> 1676.08
you see

1672.72 --> 1681.0
me being stressed out is not the problem

1676.08 --> 1681.0
the actual problem is the problem

1687.679 --> 1691.52
come to spain for a couple of days

1692.159 --> 1694.3200000000002
uh

1693.2 --> 1697.32
what

1694.32 --> 1697.32
no

1698.32 --> 1702.12
i'm not going anywhere

1702.83 --> 1705.96
[Music]

1711.12 --> 1715.84
it can do miracles

1713.36 --> 1718.24
yeah well not if i go on my own

1715.84 --> 1718.24
you know

1719.76 --> 1722.8799999999999
no

1720.96 --> 1725.679
it's not like this

1722.88 --> 1728.5590000000002
no not gonna do that i'm not gonna

1725.679 --> 1730.64
suddenly start traveling

1728.559 --> 1732.32
away

1730.64 --> 1736.96
in the middle of like

1732.32 --> 1739.2
a bad financial situation i'm not insane

1736.96 --> 1742.159
and yeah

1739.2 --> 1744.64
like even if i somehow managed to get

1742.159 --> 1747.8400000000001
people enthusiastic to finance me for

1744.64 --> 1752.5200000000002
that then still that's only a temporary

1747.84 --> 1752.52
like it doesn't fix the entire situation

1753.2 --> 1755.8400000000001
yeah

1754.399 --> 1759.4799999999998
look that's

1755.84 --> 1759.48
where you get deleted

1770.159 --> 1774.3990000000001
that is they're just projecting anyway

1772.799 --> 1778.08
right

1774.399 --> 1778.08
they do absolutely nothing

1778.84 --> 1784.399
like what they actively do to

1782.399 --> 1787.9189999999999
maintain themselves or build something

1784.399 --> 1792.399
up probably doesn't span beyond

1787.919 --> 1792.3990000000001
an hour of concentrated attention a day

1793.36 --> 1798.0
and the rest of the day they just waste

1795.44 --> 1799.919
their time being bored and feeling all

1798.0 --> 1802.159
good about themselves for being so

1799.919 --> 1806.039
efficient

1802.159 --> 1806.0390000000002
in wasting their time

1821.2 --> 1824.72
okay dusty writer

1823.919 --> 1828.24
well

1824.72 --> 1828.24
i appreciate the gesture

1828.48 --> 1832.799
i will keep it in the back of my mind

1830.24 --> 1837.0
but don't expect

1832.799 --> 1837.0
that to happen anytime soon

1840.159 --> 1843.48
come on

1853.84 --> 1860.559
well just let him let the troll speak

1857.279 --> 1863.679
he thinks he has something right

1860.559 --> 1865.84
because now our win is lazy

1863.679 --> 1868.96
even though i spend

1865.84 --> 1870.1589999999999
all of my focus

1868.96 --> 1872.48
like

1870.159 --> 1874.7990000000002
thinking about

1872.48 --> 1875.76
and developing spirit

1874.799 --> 1877.9189999999999
and

1875.76 --> 1881.679
trying to maintain momentum in higher

1877.919 --> 1881.679
consciousness for my show

1882.559 --> 1887.36
i literally spend every waking hour on

1885.2 --> 1887.3600000000001
it

1888.32 --> 1892.8799999999999
but yeah that's

1890.0 --> 1896.32
that's mostly really an internal process

1892.88 --> 1898.0800000000002
that's me listening to other videos

1896.32 --> 1901.6789999999999
and contemplating contemplating

1898.08 --> 1905.12
contemplating like a madman

1901.679 --> 1907.039
but effective i feel it is effective and

1905.12 --> 1910.799
it it works out

1907.039 --> 1914.24
that process does actually enhance

1910.799 --> 1914.24
the depth of what i could do

1915.12 --> 1919.9189999999999
in the show

1916.799 --> 1922.08
and i spend almost every waking hour not

1919.919 --> 1924.64
every waking hour the last like four

1922.08 --> 1926.72
hours usually are kind of like mellow

1924.64 --> 1929.3600000000001
and just

1926.72 --> 1929.3600000000001
take it easy

1929.519 --> 1932.64
but pretty much the rest of the entire

1931.6 --> 1936.399
day

1932.64 --> 1938.3200000000002
including from the moment i wake up

1936.399 --> 1940.1589999999999
there's no lazying about there's no like

1938.32 --> 1942.6399999999999
oh whatever

1940.159 --> 1944.0
yeah i used to do that when i was like

1942.64 --> 1946.96
even in

1944.0 --> 1946.96
into my 20s

1947.519 --> 1951.679
but now i have something to do something

1950.32 --> 1953.519
to maintain

1951.679 --> 1955.919
something to build

1953.519 --> 1958.0
even if it's just virtually even if it's

1955.919 --> 1961.2
just

1958.0 --> 1963.36
my yeah my legacy here on youtube

1961.2 --> 1965.039
the ideas that i've brought forth that i

1963.36 --> 1967.039
tried to

1965.039 --> 1970.32
reveal

1967.039 --> 1971.679
in the workings of things

1970.32 --> 1976.039
but

1971.679 --> 1976.039
ah now i lost my point

1977.2 --> 1981.1200000000001
yeah i am building on something it's

1980.24 --> 1982.559
just

1981.12 --> 1984.559
not me oh

1982.559 --> 1987.519
this thing that thing

1984.559 --> 1990.08
oh super detailed research

1987.519 --> 1992.559
now i do that differently and i hope

1990.08 --> 1994.48
that it's been revealed to also be

1992.559 --> 1998.08
effective right

1994.48 --> 1999.279
try to imagine me and what i've said so

1998.08 --> 2001.4399999999998
far

1999.279 --> 2002.559
i'm a guy that literally doesn't read

2001.44 --> 2003.679
books

2002.559 --> 2005.6789999999999
like

2003.679 --> 2008.0800000000002
almost ever

2005.679 --> 2011.2
like really never

2008.08 --> 2014.24
yet i gather this information and i do

2011.2 --> 2014.24
so effectively

2015.519 --> 2017.6
right

2016.32 --> 2019.12
well

2017.6 --> 2022.08
just imagine

2019.12 --> 2023.9189999999999
instead of this approach of that that

2022.08 --> 2025.6789999999999
thing that i'm doing i'd be reading

2023.919 --> 2028.3200000000002
books constantly yeah well then i'd

2025.679 --> 2030.0800000000002
probably be reading 10 hours of books

2028.32 --> 2033.6399999999999
every day and everything i do will be

2030.08 --> 2033.6399999999999
completely different

2035.279 --> 2039.84
and then you'd say oh well look arwen at

2037.519 --> 2042.0
least reads 10 hours a day book well i

2039.84 --> 2046.48
don't [ __ ] read books

2042.0 --> 2047.84
i do something else i do freaking magic

2046.48 --> 2049.52
i do

2047.84 --> 2051.679
energy things

2049.52 --> 2055.2
i do oracling

2051.679 --> 2057.2000000000003
i don't know how to explain it it is

2055.2 --> 2061.2799999999997
something i do it is something that

2057.2 --> 2066.96
requires a lot of strain

2061.28 --> 2066.96
and in ways sacrifices like personal

2068.079 --> 2072.04
option sacrifices

2074.0 --> 2077.839
there's just things i can't do

2078.72 --> 2084.0
i can't even explain it it's just

2081.2 --> 2086.0789999999997
palpable through empiricism through me

2084.0 --> 2088.32
being like oh [ __ ] it i'm i'm just gonna

2086.079 --> 2090.079
do this i have done that in any long

2088.32 --> 2092.3990000000003
time

2090.079 --> 2095.8390000000004
and then it is basically again the

2092.399 --> 2098.7999999999997
approach of sin it's like thinking nah

2095.839 --> 2100.72
nah [ __ ] it i can sin

2098.8 --> 2103.76
when you do it then [ __ ]

2100.72 --> 2104.9599999999996
like you feel the lash i feel the lash

2103.76 --> 2108.4
right

2104.96 --> 2110.8
in my oracling i have to

2108.4 --> 2113.04
sacrifice certain things to maintain

2110.8 --> 2115.119
focus

2113.04 --> 2117.52
like i cannot

2115.119 --> 2120.48
fully

2117.52 --> 2122.4
get absorbed by another person

2120.48 --> 2125.52
anymore

2122.4 --> 2128.839
it doesn't i can't allow that anymore

2125.52 --> 2131.839
it would unravel too many

2128.839 --> 2133.92
dynamic like energy lines that are in a

2131.839 --> 2137.599
certain order that need to be in that

2133.92 --> 2141.76
order in order for me to constantly

2137.599 --> 2144.88
wield the oracling process

2141.76 --> 2147.76
it's a personal sacrifice

2144.88 --> 2147.76
of activity

2147.92 --> 2151.28
and

2149.28 --> 2154.079
it's worth it

2151.28 --> 2158.52
but at the same time

2154.079 --> 2158.52
i'm constantly missing [ __ ]

2158.96 --> 2163.2
and i spent a lot of time i have spent a

2161.44 --> 2165.76
lot of time even the last 10 years

2163.2 --> 2168.24
reflecting with other people

2165.76 --> 2172.4
especially with my dad like

2168.24 --> 2174.72
what it is to just like

2172.4 --> 2177.2000000000003
do something right and then just miss

2174.72 --> 2177.2
everything

2178.4 --> 2183.28
it sucks

2180.079 --> 2183.28
in a way but

2184.079 --> 2188.4
not

2184.839 --> 2190.64
forever there are rewards

2188.4 --> 2194.119
it's like yeah nothing can be attained

2190.64 --> 2194.1189999999997
without a price

2200.96 --> 2204.64
that's just the mechanics of how this

2202.88 --> 2207.04
realm is built

2204.64 --> 2209.68
hello aries cursed man

2207.04 --> 2212.68
i'm filling the chat

2209.68 --> 2212.68
sheesh

2220.32 --> 2223.04
hey yado

2223.359 --> 2228.2
yeah melbourne is screwed up so i've

2225.2 --> 2228.2
seen

2253.76 --> 2257.8390000000004
yeah

2255.359 --> 2261.64
it's a bit of yeah sure

2257.839 --> 2261.64
air is cursive man

2287.92 --> 2292.56
that's right especially the thoughts

2291.119 --> 2295.76
like i am

2292.56 --> 2298.7599999999998
absolutely wrestling with my mind at

2295.76 --> 2298.76
times

2299.839 --> 2303.119
because

2301.119 --> 2306.48
like

2303.119 --> 2306.48
my mind isn't free

2306.8 --> 2315.119
because of what i'm trying to do

2312.4 --> 2318.48
what i do in my mind

2315.119 --> 2322.119
is just as consequential as what i do in

2318.48 --> 2322.119
the physical reality

2328.32 --> 2332.0
has just as much an impact

2334.96 --> 2340.4
and

2337.359 --> 2342.72
here's the thing

2340.4 --> 2346.64
i need it to be

2342.72 --> 2346.64
in order to do proper oracling

2349.04 --> 2353.2
because otherwise if my imagination is

2351.839 --> 2356.92
too free

2353.2 --> 2359.68
i cannot properly realistically

2356.92 --> 2361.119
improvisingly simulate things in order

2359.68 --> 2363.9199999999996
to unravel

2361.119 --> 2367.4
information

2363.92 --> 2367.4
about it

2372.32 --> 2376.56
because i won't get a complete picture

2380.8 --> 2385.119
so yeah the price is pretty damn high

2383.599 --> 2387.44
really

2385.119 --> 2390.48
and it's a one-way decision

2387.44 --> 2392.96
because it's gonna be like that forever

2390.48 --> 2394.96
my rest of my life

2392.96 --> 2396.7200000000003
even if i stop oracle

2394.96 --> 2399.359
because

2396.72 --> 2403.2
it's been ingrained in me i've literally

2399.359 --> 2405.04
constructed my my mind

2403.2 --> 2407.04
to become like that

2405.04 --> 2408.88
a long time ago

2407.04 --> 2410.88
and i've even said

2408.88 --> 2412.48
here i don't know if anybody here

2410.88 --> 2414.2400000000002
remembers

2412.48 --> 2415.839
that in my visions

2414.24 --> 2418.319
20 years ago

2415.839 --> 2421.839
i was like i wanted to

2418.319 --> 2423.68
be there now i wanted to be in that

2421.839 --> 2426.4
final stage where i would be able to

2423.68 --> 2430.319
wield that power because i needed it

2426.4 --> 2430.319
then but i couldn't wield it

2435.2 --> 2439.4399999999996
right

2436.64 --> 2440.64
so yeah effectively i've built myself to

2439.44 --> 2444.56
do this

2440.64 --> 2444.56
and you can't un-build yourself

2445.44 --> 2452.119
once you've spent half your life

2448.56 --> 2452.119
becoming this

2486.72 --> 2493.04
tried telling god it was okay to worship

2489.599 --> 2495.839
why would i try telling god that

2493.04 --> 2495.839
uh

2508.079 --> 2514.8
all right obviously sarah says

2511.839 --> 2514.7999999999997
i appreciate that

2518.0 --> 2523.04
i definitely groan in confidence i know

2520.16 --> 2523.839
what is what i know how it is

2523.04 --> 2525.52
like

2523.839 --> 2527.839
i'm getting to that point where i'm

2525.52 --> 2529.599
getting arrogant again it happened

2527.839 --> 2530.88
before

2529.599 --> 2532.96
it's just like

2530.88 --> 2537.04
yeah when i enter something i'm very

2532.96 --> 2538.64
insecure but still

2537.04 --> 2541.2
like new things

2538.64 --> 2543.5989999999997
like really new things that i've never

2541.2 --> 2546.0789999999997
touched in any way

2543.599 --> 2549.3590000000004
make me very insecure

2546.079 --> 2552.6400000000003
but then once i actually embrace it make

2549.359 --> 2554.64
it mine and like put like down a period

2552.64 --> 2557.52
of time

2554.64 --> 2561.2
basically bridge the

2557.52 --> 2563.52
the the time dimension

2561.2 --> 2564.96
in my spirit

2563.52 --> 2566.72
then

2564.96 --> 2568.56
always at the end i'm going to be an

2566.72 --> 2570.8799999999997
arrogant bastard because i'm going to be

2568.56 --> 2572.7999999999997
like understanding everything so much

2570.88 --> 2576.319
better than everybody

2572.8 --> 2578.96
and i like being like that

2576.319 --> 2581.599
i know everybody else hates that this is

2578.96 --> 2583.28
about me

2581.599 --> 2585.2000000000003
or maybe they think it's funny or

2583.28 --> 2586.7200000000003
whatever

2585.2 --> 2591.64
it's just that

2586.72 --> 2591.64
i'm a perfectionist at that

2596.88 --> 2603.839
have you an ambition for five years time

2601.28 --> 2603.8390000000004
what do you mean

2605.28 --> 2610.2400000000002
oh i've wanted to perfect my cosmetical

2608.64 --> 2612.96
understanding and

2610.24 --> 2615.359
basically put down all the options that

2612.96 --> 2617.92
could be

2615.359 --> 2620.0
to get a complete

2617.92 --> 2621.119
framework of what could be a complete

2620.0 --> 2623.44
model

2621.119 --> 2624.8
interdimensional model of possibilities

2623.44 --> 2627.76
and options

2624.8 --> 2631.8
i think i've pretty much done that

2627.76 --> 2631.8
more than most can handle

2642.8 --> 2648.8
huh yeah thanks pj christie yeah 2017

2646.56 --> 2651.2
i was a

2648.8 --> 2653.8390000000004
different functioning type of person and

2651.2 --> 2655.9199999999996
it was much it was much fresher right

2653.839 --> 2658.0789999999997
these insights

2655.92 --> 2661.28
were much more holographically

2658.079 --> 2663.3590000000004
pronounced in my mind

2661.28 --> 2667.8390000000004
much more clearly

2663.359 --> 2667.839
so it was like obsessed with my ideas

2668.0 --> 2669.92
now

2668.96 --> 2672.0
it's

2669.92 --> 2675.28
kind of settled and now i'm dealing much

2672.0 --> 2678.319
more with everybody else not

2675.28 --> 2678.3190000000004
not dealing with them

2679.62 --> 2682.7599999999998
[Music]

2685.52 --> 2689.7599999999998
i just kind of hope that people will go

2687.76 --> 2693.119
beyond the oh

2689.76 --> 2694.7200000000003
stage and actually start to get it

2693.119 --> 2698.6400000000003
and

2694.72 --> 2698.64
like be able to fit it

2699.44 --> 2704.0
or use it as a

2701.119 --> 2708.2400000000002
blueprint for

2704.0 --> 2712.319
framework of physical reality somehow

2708.24 --> 2712.319
and no mush test back then yeah yeah

2716.56 --> 2721.599
i've never worn a mustache before yeah

2719.44 --> 2722.8
before i started to get it

2721.599 --> 2724.88
on the show

2722.8 --> 2729.3590000000004
ever

2724.88 --> 2729.359
because it's like oh no that's not elven

2730.72 --> 2733.9199999999996
but i really appreciate having one

2732.64 --> 2737.92
though

2733.92 --> 2737.92
it's kind of a bit of a difference

2738.8 --> 2743.1600000000003
for my self-image also

2746.0 --> 2751.44
but i've pretty much only had

2748.4 --> 2751.44
compliments about it

2757.68 --> 2762.7999999999997
perhaps you should record your ideas in

2759.76 --> 2766.079
a book or blog well what do you think

2762.8 --> 2766.079
my youtube channel is

2769.359 --> 2773.319
isn't that recorded

2778.64 --> 2783.1189999999997
and i have an

2780.48 --> 2786.119
option to explain it live every single

2783.119 --> 2786.119
time

2824.64 --> 2826.96
hmm

2827.359 --> 2831.839
yeah that's a good one obviously sarah

2829.44 --> 2831.839
says

2832.8 --> 2837.04
answering in-depth question

2834.88 --> 2838.88
why would they lie

2837.04 --> 2840.4
caters to your friends

2838.88 --> 2843.52
telling them

2840.4 --> 2845.599
the why set some free and some are

2843.52 --> 2847.92
begrudging

2845.599 --> 2847.92
yeah

2856.24 --> 2860.3999999999996
it's it's still kind of weird though in

2859.119 --> 2862.88
my opinion

2860.4 --> 2866.2400000000002
how most people get to that point that

2862.88 --> 2868.7200000000003
they actually just

2866.24 --> 2870.3999999999996
innocently start asking like why

2868.72 --> 2874.48
like they've never actually thought

2870.4 --> 2876.64
about it like when i was not

2874.48 --> 2878.64
when i was still kind of like a baller

2876.64 --> 2880.48
avoiding flat earth

2878.64 --> 2882.4
in my weird

2880.48 --> 2883.28
mind

2882.4 --> 2886.319
yeah

2883.28 --> 2888.4
my mind compartmentalization kind of way

2886.319 --> 2890.079
like even talking about it but not

2888.4 --> 2892.079
remembering it

2890.079 --> 2894.2400000000002
understanding the mechanics perfectly

2892.079 --> 2895.04
but not remembering it

2894.24 --> 2896.5589999999997
like

2895.04 --> 2900.64
it being just

2896.559 --> 2903.76
a microcosm game

2900.64 --> 2903.7599999999998
but even during that

2904.0 --> 2906.96
now i lost my point

2908.559 --> 2912.559
right hold on now i know what it's a

2910.559 --> 2914.2400000000002
response to obviously sarah says there

2912.559 --> 2917.599
yeah yeah

2914.24 --> 2917.5989999999997
even when i was like that

2917.68 --> 2922.0789999999997
i wouldn't ask that question

2922.16 --> 2928.24
like why would they do that like

2925.28 --> 2930.88
no because it's i kind of already knew i

2928.24 --> 2933.04
just didn't want to be reminded about it

2930.88 --> 2935.599
because it scared me

2933.04 --> 2935.599
back then

2936.0 --> 2940.079
i wouldn't just roll out oh why would

2938.72 --> 2941.2
they do that

2940.079 --> 2943.2000000000003
because

2941.2 --> 2945.4399999999996
just as soon as it started kind of

2943.2 --> 2948.48
hinting again like there's something

2945.44 --> 2950.64
wrong that would immediately be implied

2948.48 --> 2954.2400000000002
to my spirit and i wouldn't ask such a

2950.64 --> 2956.8799999999997
question because i already knew it

2954.24 --> 2960.3999999999996
in such a moment it always surprises me

2956.88 --> 2962.559
how easily people just roll it out

2960.4 --> 2964.7200000000003
and sometimes over and over again like

2962.559 --> 2967.52
they actually completely forget that

2964.72 --> 2969.52
they don't have their senses extended

2967.52 --> 2973.599
to pick it up before they start

2969.52 --> 2973.599
blabbering about it so odd to me

2980.96 --> 2988.2400000000002
why would they lie yeah

2984.0 --> 2990.48
why would you ask such an obvious

2988.24 --> 2993.839
piece of knowledge why would you ask

2990.48 --> 2993.839
such a question when

2994.16 --> 2997.839
it's

2994.96 --> 3001.7200000000003
like one of the most discussed subjects

2997.839 --> 3001.72
in history probably

3018.48 --> 3025.559
right yeah that's that's a decent

3020.88 --> 3025.559
summary obviously sarah says

3030.64 --> 3034.96
hmm yeah welcome to the stream

3036.48 --> 3039.48
heliocentric

3055.92 --> 3060.2400000000002
it's hilarious that

3058.24 --> 3062.4799999999996
and ironic

3060.24 --> 3062.4799999999996
that

3062.559 --> 3067.0400000000004
i don't know if i should be saying this

3065.68 --> 3070.0789999999997
it's like

3067.04 --> 3074.079
no and the heliocentrists

3070.079 --> 3076.1600000000003
are actually not worshippers they're

3074.079 --> 3077.92
they're atheists they don't worship

3076.16 --> 3081.52
anything they

3077.92 --> 3083.44
think they are avoiding worship

3081.52 --> 3085.319
they're effectively worshiping the voice

3083.44 --> 3087.28
that's what i say right and

3085.319 --> 3089.68
heliocentrism doesn't mean that they

3087.28 --> 3091.76
have it at the center of the universe

3089.68 --> 3093.9199999999996
and that's what any heliocentrist would

3091.76 --> 3094.8
actually answer it was a rebuttal to

3093.92 --> 3097.839
that

3094.8 --> 3097.8390000000004
a normal conversation

3099.04 --> 3102.64
the ironic thing is is that

3102.88 --> 3108.079
there are sun worshipers

3105.68 --> 3110.5589999999997
and that's the gnostics

3108.079 --> 3112.4
they are the ones that are

3110.559 --> 3115.0400000000004
like highlighting

3112.4 --> 3116.079
how christ

3115.04 --> 3118.96
in

3116.079 --> 3120.96
a certain framework of the bible display

3118.96 --> 3124.16
and bible story

3120.96 --> 3126.319
is the representative of the sun

3124.16 --> 3128.319
because of the cyclical

3126.319 --> 3130.16
pattern

3128.319 --> 3131.68
that is placed within the story

3130.16 --> 3132.48
framework

3131.68 --> 3134.7999999999997
right

3132.48 --> 3137.68
they are actually the sun worshippers

3134.8 --> 3139.119
they are literally idolizing saying the

3137.68 --> 3141.52
son is

3139.119 --> 3144.0
christ which according to christian

3141.52 --> 3147.359
belief it means is god

3144.0 --> 3150.4
like the creator making the sun into the

3147.359 --> 3153.64
creator effectively or esoterically to

3150.4 --> 3155.599
them right that's actual sun worship

3153.64 --> 3158.0
heliocentrist

3155.599 --> 3160.48
doesn't do that they're void worshippers

3158.0 --> 3162.24
they don't believe in worship

3160.48 --> 3165.44
doesn't mean they don't worship it's

3162.24 --> 3167.839
just that they don't believe in worship

3165.44 --> 3169.04
so when they do it they don't see it

3167.839 --> 3171.52
it's just

3169.04 --> 3173.599
something they do without thinking about

3171.52 --> 3173.599
it

3177.44 --> 3181.48
it's the opposite of belief

3181.92 --> 3185.92
yeah yeah it's the opposite of

3183.92 --> 3188.7200000000003
everything of reality

3185.92 --> 3188.7200000000003
that's what it is

3191.28 --> 3198.0
atheism is the lack of belief no

3195.359 --> 3198.0
no it isn't

3198.4 --> 3202.2400000000002
the word

3199.76 --> 3204.079
reveals what it is is a

3202.24 --> 3206.9599999999996
theism

3204.079 --> 3208.4
god-ism

3206.96 --> 3210.079
atheism

3208.4 --> 3212.319
anti

3210.079 --> 3214.1600000000003
it's not a lack of belief it's the

3212.319 --> 3216.48
opposite it's

3214.16 --> 3220.7599999999998
turning it inside out and saying like no

3216.48 --> 3220.76
it's the exact opposite

3225.2 --> 3229.68
it's not a lack of belief

3227.52 --> 3232.8
a lack of belief would be just like yeah

3229.68 --> 3234.839
i don't know it's like more agnostic

3232.8 --> 3238.319
like yeah

3234.839 --> 3241.839
right no atheism is like no no it's

3238.319 --> 3243.68
completely up they literally say it they

3241.839 --> 3246.0789999999997
literally say it

3243.68 --> 3251.3999999999996
they turn everything inside out proudly

3246.079 --> 3251.4
and they're convinced that that is real

3265.839 --> 3269.68
atheist mr worship no

3270.559 --> 3274.6400000000003
no it isn't

3273.28 --> 3277.76
but some do

3274.64 --> 3280.16
get worshippy towards man

3277.76 --> 3282.2400000000002
and others do the opposite and they just

3280.16 --> 3284.3999999999996
want to destroy all man and they think

3282.24 --> 3289.4399999999996
the man is the problem right

3284.4 --> 3292.1600000000003
so no atheist atheism is not man worship

3289.44 --> 3294.4
but anything can happen within atheism

3292.16 --> 3296.96
because they don't believe in anything

3294.4 --> 3298.7200000000003
to be real so they'll just do it because

3296.96 --> 3300.7200000000003
it it doesn't mean anything has no

3298.72 --> 3302.8799999999997
consequences there's no order there's no

3300.72 --> 3305.68
god

3302.88 --> 3307.6800000000003
it's all just random evolution and

3305.68 --> 3309.9199999999996
[ __ ] and

3307.68 --> 3309.9199999999996
yeah

3310.48 --> 3315.2
that's the point

3312.24 --> 3316.24
so they might just say oh i'm gonna

3315.2 --> 3318.96
do this

3316.24 --> 3321.04
magic or worship this person and build a

3318.96 --> 3323.28
cult and then it's like oh yeah sure if

3321.04 --> 3324.96
you want to do that

3323.28 --> 3326.88
doesn't really mean anything anyway

3324.96 --> 3331.28
right

3326.88 --> 3331.28
so yeah atheists might end up doing that

3331.839 --> 3335.92
and they'll fall back to like are you

3334.24 --> 3337.52
like scared of what you're doing in the

3335.92 --> 3339.6800000000003
face of god and they're like no i don't

3337.52 --> 3340.64
really believe anything about it it's

3339.68 --> 3344.359
just

3340.64 --> 3344.359
we're just playing around

3348.799 --> 3353.96
right so

3350.24 --> 3353.9599999999996
there is a big difference

3365.359 --> 3368.72
they worship whether they understand

3367.359 --> 3369.68
that or not

3368.72 --> 3371.2799999999997
yeah

3369.68 --> 3373.2799999999997
and that's why i say they're they're

3371.28 --> 3375.3590000000004
avoid worshippers

3373.28 --> 3380.48
they don't worship the sun no they

3375.359 --> 3380.48
worship the idea of the black hole

3383.76 --> 3390.2000000000003
the the black hole the ultimate negator

3387.2 --> 3390.2
see

3397.28 --> 3400.28
hmm

3400.83 --> 3403.92
[Music]

3412.96 --> 3415.96
what

3424.96 --> 3429.64
you should not worship these things

3426.64 --> 3429.64
right

3445.76 --> 3450.96
that it takes it takes quite a lot to

3448.48 --> 3454.4
worship something it basically takes

3450.96 --> 3454.4
some level of obsession

3456.64 --> 3462.0789999999997
and personal sacrifice that's really

3458.799 --> 3462.079
what it always comes down to

3464.559 --> 3468.88
and hey if

3466.24 --> 3470.4799999999996
you're like fanatical about something

3468.88 --> 3472.2400000000002
technical

3470.48 --> 3474.48
and you literally

3472.24 --> 3476.0789999999997
throw everything overboard just to be

3474.48 --> 3479.52
the perfect that

3476.079 --> 3482.0
then you effectively worship it

3479.52 --> 3485.839
and you make the sacrifices by

3482.0 --> 3485.839
throwing everything else overboard

3486.96 --> 3492.16
so yeah

3488.72 --> 3492.16
what is worship really

3500.559 --> 3502.799
worship

3501.599 --> 3504.88
could be

3502.799 --> 3507.7599999999998
a little bit oversimplified but it could

3504.88 --> 3507.76
be said that it is

3508.559 --> 3513.799
willful

3509.839 --> 3513.799
fanatical dedication

3522.16 --> 3529.68
but that describes an action more when

3525.68 --> 3532.16
actual worship always has some

3529.68 --> 3532.16
icon

3532.24 --> 3536.3999999999996
at the

3533.359 --> 3537.7599999999998
central focus point and multiple people

3536.4 --> 3540.0
can

3537.76 --> 3543.119
focus on that same point that is kind of

3540.0 --> 3545.76
what makes it different from

3543.119 --> 3547.52
just being really good at something it's

3545.76 --> 3549.92
very similar to worship but that's

3547.52 --> 3549.92
different

3557.44 --> 3559.839
anyway

3566.799 --> 3572.16
a diety

3568.48 --> 3575.28
yeah that's nonsense

3572.16 --> 3577.52
now that's the atheist version

3575.28 --> 3580.079
jared sanford

3577.52 --> 3582.64
literally inserted there by atheists

3580.079 --> 3586.7200000000003
that religion

3582.64 --> 3588.5589999999997
like oh worship of a deity

3586.72 --> 3589.9199999999996
like oh really

3588.559 --> 3592.0
no

3589.92 --> 3593.92
no no that's not

3592.0 --> 3597.319
exclusive

3593.92 --> 3597.319
for deities

3602.48 --> 3607.44
like you can have icons in there

3605.28 --> 3610.079
that you treat like a deity even though

3607.44 --> 3611.839
you don't consciously

3610.079 --> 3613.28
speak that out

3611.839 --> 3614.96
or even

3613.28 --> 3617.3590000000004
acknowledge

3614.96 --> 3619.76
but you still treat it like a deity an

3617.359 --> 3619.7599999999998
icon

3621.2 --> 3625.16
could be based on a person

3633.76 --> 3638.559
they worship things like the gym what

3640.4 --> 3643.4
right

3656.0 --> 3661.2
we don't believe the globe demands our

3658.24 --> 3661.2
adoration what

3668.88 --> 3673.6800000000003
you don't believe the globe demands your

3671.52 --> 3674.96
adoration

3673.68 --> 3676.8799999999997
but

3674.96 --> 3679.359
then you're technically fooling this

3676.88 --> 3681.76
yourself because you're constantly

3679.359 --> 3687.359
trying to defend

3681.76 --> 3687.3590000000004
the legitimacy of its virtual existence

3689.839 --> 3693.68
you're constantly

3691.839 --> 3696.64
adoring it

3693.68 --> 3699.5989999999997
by making it into your

3696.64 --> 3701.52
hope for the future

3699.599 --> 3703.2000000000003
by defending it

3701.52 --> 3705.7599999999998
in the face of critical thought and

3703.2 --> 3705.7599999999998
inquiry

3707.119 --> 3709.44
so

3708.4 --> 3710.96
yeah

3709.44 --> 3714.2400000000002
you do

3710.96 --> 3714.2400000000002
believe in the globe

3714.319 --> 3720.2
and it does demand your adoration that's

3716.88 --> 3720.2000000000003
what you do

3734.079 --> 3738.3590000000004
i get your own dirt yeah

3764.799 --> 3768.96
wow from the grave that is a repulsive

3766.88 --> 3771.839
thing to say

3768.96 --> 3771.839
but sure

3773.68 --> 3777.5589999999997
if that's what you do

3808.559 --> 3812.0
nobody worships the globe

3814.559 --> 3820.2400000000002
but again what is worshipping you know

3817.76 --> 3822.48
do you have to consciously know you were

3820.24 --> 3824.16
worshiping something in order to worship

3822.48 --> 3826.799
something

3824.16 --> 3830.64
or do your acts

3826.799 --> 3830.64
basically prove the worship

3831.119 --> 3837.079
by your

3832.64 --> 3837.0789999999997
willful fanatical dedication

3853.28 --> 3856.28
what

3882.319 --> 3888.0
by the way i'd like to say that

3885.52 --> 3890.88
i am kind of proud

3888.0 --> 3890.88
of the chat

3892.72 --> 3897.0389999999998
like what it is

3894.72 --> 3899.5989999999997
compared to most chats

3897.039 --> 3901.44
because i think that my chat probably

3899.599 --> 3904.0
contains

3901.44 --> 3905.92
the most diverse

3904.0 --> 3909.039
philosophies

3905.92 --> 3910.799
in any chat out there

3909.039 --> 3914.7200000000003
where people that would probably

3910.799 --> 3916.24
normally just go into each other's necks

3914.72 --> 3921.0789999999997
go at it

3916.24 --> 3921.0789999999997
because of disagreements in here

3922.079 --> 3928.319
there's a lot of like

3924.559 --> 3931.2000000000003
philosophical diversity yet

3928.319 --> 3934.24
people can still get along and actually

3931.2 --> 3937.839
inquire some from the other side

3934.24 --> 3937.839
i'm very happy about that

3940.319 --> 3944.0
of course not talking about the terrible

3942.88 --> 3947.119
terrible

3944.0 --> 3949.68
gamma sock trolls that constantly come

3947.119 --> 3953.92
popping up every now and then

3949.68 --> 3956.0
but yeah the actual chat participants

3953.92 --> 3957.6800000000003
you guys are really diverse have you

3956.0 --> 3959.2
actually noticed just look in the chat

3957.68 --> 3962.48
just look at what everybody's saying and

3959.2 --> 3962.48
then realize like wow

3962.96 --> 3967.839
it's not just people constantly abusing

3965.52 --> 3970.079
wrenches to ban people and making it in

3967.839 --> 3973.119
some kind of tag team situation no this

3970.079 --> 3973.119
chat actually works

3974.24 --> 3978.4799999999996
and it's pretty rare that it actually

3976.319 --> 3981.0389999999998
works

3978.48 --> 3982.16
so yeah i can

3981.039 --> 3983.6800000000003
i think i

3982.16 --> 3986.8799999999997
i dare to claim that as an

3983.68 --> 3986.8799999999997
accomplishment at least

3990.64 --> 3994.799
right we do talk about wide range of

3992.64 --> 3996.799
topics but we also talk about the

3994.799 --> 3999.2
sensitive topics

3996.799 --> 4002.48
that do actually approach

3999.2 --> 4005.52
the more polarized situations and yet

4002.48 --> 4005.52
people can still

4005.599 --> 4009.52
not

4006.72 --> 4010.8799999999997
strike at the other and start a war

4009.52 --> 4013.68
basically

4010.88 --> 4015.44
a chat war right

4013.68 --> 4017.44
i have respect for that and i'm happy

4015.44 --> 4020.4
about that

4017.44 --> 4022.7200000000003
when i basically started to use this

4020.4 --> 4025.28
approach for my chat i didn't

4022.72 --> 4026.64
necessarily expect it was gonna work out

4025.28 --> 4028.48
in the end

4026.64 --> 4031.359
because it's been pretty rowdy in my

4028.48 --> 4033.76
chat like two years ago just look at it

4031.359 --> 4035.2799999999997
it's crazy [ __ ] sometimes

4033.76 --> 4037.5200000000004
and now

4035.28 --> 4040.1600000000003
it's much more balanced this feels much

4037.52 --> 4040.16
more like a

4042.24 --> 4045.1189999999997
like a

4044.24 --> 4046.839
a

4045.119 --> 4049.44
an old greek

4046.839 --> 4052.24
philosopher conference room or something

4049.44 --> 4052.2400000000002
on the outside

4053.28 --> 4057.6800000000003
really people come just to contemplate

4055.68 --> 4061.2
and to hear and to reflect upon one

4057.68 --> 4063.7599999999998
another in a very original

4061.2 --> 4065.68
peaceful way

4063.76 --> 4068.0
right because it's always been very

4065.68 --> 4071.0389999999998
difficult for people that are very

4068.0 --> 4073.52
invested into intellectual things

4071.039 --> 4075.599
to get along with one another when you

4073.52 --> 4078.079
have different ideas it's always been

4075.599 --> 4080.559
very difficult to maintain

4078.079 --> 4083.2000000000003
because once it gets like really

4080.559 --> 4083.2000000000003
personal

4083.28 --> 4088.6400000000003
even historically like people would die

4086.16 --> 4091.44
over that sometimes it's historically

4088.64 --> 4093.92
recorded that that did actually happen

4091.44 --> 4096.0
a couple of times even in greek

4093.92 --> 4098.319
ancient history

4096.0 --> 4099.12
it just eventually just killed the other

4098.319 --> 4100.080000000001
guy

4099.12 --> 4101.839
because

4100.08 --> 4103.199
he couldn't deal with it

4101.839 --> 4105.679
right

4103.199 --> 4107.919999999999
and i think that

4105.679 --> 4110.4
considering the overall situation out

4107.92 --> 4113.12
there in the world it is pretty rare to

4110.4 --> 4115.839
just have so many different people

4113.12 --> 4117.679
so many different ideas and philosophies

4115.839 --> 4120.4
that they're very passionate about about

4117.679 --> 4123.679
their position that they still all can

4120.4 --> 4126.239
be in one chat room

4123.679 --> 4127.839
and have discussions and not just be all

4126.239 --> 4130.0
oh i don't want to hurt anybody's

4127.839 --> 4132.88
feelings either

4130.0 --> 4135.359
just be direct honest don't

4132.88 --> 4138.159000000001
unnecessarily agitate i mean sometimes

4135.359 --> 4141.92
some people get a little frustrated

4138.159 --> 4144.08
but then it's dealt with properly

4141.92 --> 4145.92
and they do usually retreat and then

4144.08 --> 4147.5199999999995
come back later and they're calm again

4145.92 --> 4150.2390000000005
right there's an understanding of how

4147.52 --> 4151.6
this works and flows and it works well

4150.239 --> 4153.199
overall

4151.6 --> 4156.6
and i'm happy about that

4153.199 --> 4156.599999999999
proud of that

4170.799 --> 4174.96
oh

4172.239 --> 4176.48
much more interesting than nathan's you

4174.96 --> 4179.12
it was a different type of show

4176.48 --> 4180.799
professor phil bell

4179.12 --> 4182.159
like flat earth debates is much more

4180.799 --> 4184.4
hardcore

4182.159 --> 4186.159
it's just the bottom line

4184.4 --> 4187.3589999999995
you know the horizon

4186.159 --> 4189.04
the non

4187.359 --> 4191.4400000000005
geometric one

4189.04 --> 4191.44
anyway

4198.08 --> 4203.199
i still appreciate nathan's show

4201.04 --> 4205.44
not always though sometimes i'm just not

4203.199 --> 4207.839999999999
too much in the mood for it

4205.44 --> 4210.0
and sometimes i am very much in the mood

4207.84 --> 4212.0
for it but i've

4210.0 --> 4216.32
found a lot of

4212.0 --> 4219.12
in inspiration being part of it and

4216.32 --> 4220.32
that's just really

4219.12 --> 4222.239
smart

4220.32 --> 4223.679
in their own ways smart different sorts

4222.239 --> 4225.199
of smarts

4223.679 --> 4227.4400000000005
all kinds of fronts

4225.199 --> 4229.5199999999995
people in there and there's a great

4227.44 --> 4232.96
chemistry it's

4229.52 --> 4236.400000000001
the best group i've ever been part of

4232.96 --> 4238.4
the most stimulating by far

4236.4 --> 4241.199
intellectually and

4238.4 --> 4242.719
comedically too we have a lot of

4241.199 --> 4245.44
hilarious

4242.719 --> 4247.36
moments that's not recorded after the

4245.44 --> 4249.44
shows are over even the after show

4247.36 --> 4251.199
recording ends then we end up just

4249.44 --> 4252.5599999999995
talking about everything and sometimes

4251.199 --> 4254.719
it gets a bit of

4252.56 --> 4257.52
really personal emotional

4254.719 --> 4260.08
not you no no not normally

4257.52 --> 4262.080000000001
and sometimes it gets like really

4260.08 --> 4264.48
hardcore somebody needs to get something

4262.08 --> 4267.199
off their chest

4264.48 --> 4269.759999999999
and we yeah we gossip

4267.199 --> 4272.159
a lot

4269.76 --> 4274.719
but we always try to stay fair like we

4272.159 --> 4276.08
don't poison each other's waters to rile

4274.719 --> 4278.08
each other up

4276.08 --> 4280.4
we take each other very serious we don't

4278.08 --> 4283.5199999999995
try to manipulate anybody

4280.4 --> 4287.839999999999
and i really like that group

4283.52 --> 4287.84
so for me it has a lot of value

4305.6 --> 4309.360000000001
well it's it's kind of funny though you

4307.44 --> 4310.879999999999
know you dislike the use of this mute

4309.36 --> 4312.639999999999
button and

4310.88 --> 4315.64
the rudeness

4312.64 --> 4315.64
well

4317.28 --> 4322.4
apparently there's a whole bunch of

4319.199 --> 4325.678999999999
people out there that do exactly the

4322.4 --> 4327.599999999999
opposite and actually really appreciate

4325.679 --> 4328.719
how nathan does it

4327.6 --> 4331.92
because

4328.719 --> 4334.32
he has a lot of support

4331.92 --> 4334.32
all right

4334.64 --> 4340.96
it's on record just look at his list of

4337.04 --> 4344.239
patreon supporters just like what

4340.96 --> 4344.2390000000005
i'm jealous of [ __ ]

4345.12 --> 4349.76
nathan's intellect oh yeah

4347.92 --> 4352.88
dude he is

4349.76 --> 4354.400000000001
he's very smart in some departments he's

4352.88 --> 4357.84
not perfect

4354.4 --> 4357.839999999999
he's very good with

4358.48 --> 4363.5199999999995
language application

4360.48 --> 4365.919999999999
the english side look very good at it

4363.52 --> 4368.2390000000005
very dynamic

4365.92 --> 4368.2390000000005
and

4369.44 --> 4371.839999999999
it's just

4377.04 --> 4384.48
he's just not afraid to go there

4379.92 --> 4387.36
when it comes to personal confrontation

4384.48 --> 4391.28
like he really just

4387.36 --> 4391.28
goes straight to the point

4392.32 --> 4397.5199999999995
and he's very good at that

4394.239 --> 4399.5199999999995
it's become his shtick and he's like

4397.52 --> 4400.88
people are expecting him to do that at

4399.52 --> 4403.1990000000005
this point

4400.88 --> 4404.159000000001
because he's so good at it

4403.199 --> 4407.678999999999
and it

4404.159 --> 4412.4
gives a sensation to those that enjoy it

4407.679 --> 4415.12
of like see if you're just fearless

4412.4 --> 4417.36
then you can just do it it's very

4415.12 --> 4418.4
inspiring in ways

4417.36 --> 4420.48
because

4418.4 --> 4423.04
not just concerning globe earth

4420.48 --> 4425.36
believers or anything but in general

4423.04 --> 4427.28
there's a lot of people that are very

4425.36 --> 4428.32
delusional about a great

4427.28 --> 4431.759999999999
different

4428.32 --> 4431.759999999999
amount of things out there

4432.0 --> 4436.96
that a lot of people have trouble with

4434.4 --> 4439.679
dealing with that in general and they do

4436.96 --> 4441.76
get kind of like okay i'll just avoid it

4439.679 --> 4444.56
well then to see somebody like nathan to

4441.76 --> 4445.92
just bang and go straight at it straight

4444.56 --> 4447.84
to the point

4445.92 --> 4449.52
no mercy

4447.84 --> 4451.6
it's a relief

4449.52 --> 4453.6
and it is a feeling of encouragement

4451.6 --> 4455.84
that might actually help people kind of

4453.6 --> 4460.08
shake out of that passive response to

4455.84 --> 4460.08
the delusion of the outside world a bit

4460.48 --> 4466.4
and that's also why i definitely think

4462.32 --> 4470.239
he deserves all that support

4466.4 --> 4472.799999999999
i just wish i'd get some of that too

4470.239 --> 4475.678999999999
but then again nathan is

4472.8 --> 4478.320000000001
putting a lot of just maintenance and

4475.679 --> 4480.4
mechanical effort into his shows as well

4478.32 --> 4482.239
and for me it's just me coming on the

4480.4 --> 4484.0
stage and if it wasn't for adam meekin i

4482.239 --> 4485.839999999999
wouldn't even have like an interesting

4484.0 --> 4488.88
background

4485.84 --> 4488.88
it's really all him

4493.679 --> 4496.679
so

4500.719 --> 4506.32
you want me to let you back to question

4503.44 --> 4509.32
no we don't do that here yeah yeah

4506.32 --> 4509.32
classic

4510.159 --> 4513.679
screaming abuse

4514.0 --> 4520.4
he's not screaming

4517.04 --> 4520.4
and how is it abuse

4520.48 --> 4522.879999999999
tell me

4523.04 --> 4526.08
when somebody literally is ignoring

4525.12 --> 4528.4
everything

4526.08 --> 4530.64
you're saying when it is integral to the

4528.4 --> 4533.36
conversation and the general subject

4530.64 --> 4535.52
right and people then on purpose

4533.36 --> 4537.679
defiantly avoid

4535.52 --> 4539.360000000001
it

4537.679 --> 4542.0
constantly like

4539.36 --> 4545.04
you know the counter because like 20

4542.0 --> 4546.239
times sometimes like how can you

4545.04 --> 4548.719
not

4546.239 --> 4550.239
get rude

4548.719 --> 4553.44
after that

4550.239 --> 4555.599999999999
when you're being disrespected and

4553.44 --> 4558.239
gaslighted

4555.6 --> 4560.08
manipulated in plain sight

4558.239 --> 4562.4
how can you not

4560.08 --> 4564.719
get pissed off and root against that

4562.4 --> 4564.719
okay

4564.88 --> 4567.84
you tell me

4574.159 --> 4578.32
yeah you personally prefer to listen to

4576.08 --> 4580.88
constructive ideas

4578.32 --> 4584.0
yeah but the thing is

4580.88 --> 4586.4800000000005
when you are against somebody

4584.0 --> 4591.04
you're in the direct conversation

4586.48 --> 4591.04
with somebody that is just blatantly

4591.28 --> 4595.679
ignoring

4593.28 --> 4597.5199999999995
intrical elements of the conversation

4595.679 --> 4601.1990000000005
that you're having it's trying to

4597.52 --> 4602.88
manipulate you by avoiding the question

4601.199 --> 4607.678999999999
or asking

4602.88 --> 4610.0
your not relevant not directly relevant

4607.679 --> 4612.56
question or a question that's gonna

4610.0 --> 4614.56
probably be good to bring up later that

4612.56 --> 4615.679
you're insisting

4614.56 --> 4618.400000000001
be the

4615.679 --> 4620.96
subject at hand right then just to avoid

4618.4 --> 4623.28
answering a question

4620.96 --> 4625.44
you know how

4623.28 --> 4627.84
how could you not

4625.44 --> 4630.719
get rude in the face of that

4627.84 --> 4632.56
that's normal

4630.719 --> 4635.44
right

4632.56 --> 4638.159000000001
in in face-to-face world if somebody did

4635.44 --> 4638.159
act like that

4638.88 --> 4645.12
like people would have to walk away or

4642.0 --> 4647.76
basically punch somebody in the face

4645.12 --> 4651.679
now in the real world fortunately people

4647.76 --> 4654.4800000000005
don't really often tend to go that far

4651.679 --> 4656.56
because when they do they do actually

4654.48 --> 4658.718999999999
get punched in the face right that's the

4656.56 --> 4660.56
luxury of internet is people not

4658.719 --> 4662.88
actually being able to punch you in the

4660.56 --> 4665.6
face so you can be that horrific

4662.88 --> 4668.4800000000005
manipulating piece of [ __ ]

4665.6 --> 4670.159000000001
without any physical consequences oh

4668.48 --> 4671.919999999999
you're so free

4670.159 --> 4674.92
to be a scumbag

4671.92 --> 4674.92
yeah

4682.239 --> 4686.5599999999995
now the only way

4684.159 --> 4689.28
you can just

4686.56 --> 4690.719
have constructive ideas

4689.28 --> 4693.04
is by

4690.719 --> 4697.6
only being in conversations with people

4693.04 --> 4697.6
that are going to respect the rules

4698.159 --> 4704.199
the rules being the rules set for a show

4710.4 --> 4713.44
like

4711.199 --> 4714.159
to run things how they work

4713.44 --> 4716.799999999999
with

4714.159 --> 4718.639999999999
with the emphasis that are required for

4716.8 --> 4721.679
it

4718.64 --> 4724.4800000000005
which is answer the question

4721.679 --> 4726.4800000000005
right if if they with all these ballers

4724.48 --> 4728.879999999999
that just answered the question

4726.48 --> 4730.08
basically relinquish

4728.88 --> 4732.400000000001
yeah

4730.08 --> 4734.96
right we have no evidence the earth is

4732.4 --> 4736.799999999999
actually flat this is all just mind

4734.96 --> 4737.679
experiments

4736.8 --> 4740.08
then

4737.679 --> 4742.88
kind of like me and bowen they would

4740.08 --> 4744.64
probably be afterward able

4742.88 --> 4748.64
to just have

4744.64 --> 4751.76
ideas about how it would be if it was

4748.64 --> 4754.08
real like balwin

4751.76 --> 4755.84
and not get screamed at

4754.08 --> 4757.84
because they at least

4755.84 --> 4760.32
were just honest

4757.84 --> 4764.08
about what is real

4760.32 --> 4765.84
and not force a manipulation of reality

4764.08 --> 4768.159
onto everybody

4765.84 --> 4770.56
in the conversation

4768.159 --> 4773.5199999999995
right once you just get honest you

4770.56 --> 4774.88
actually get freedom

4773.52 --> 4780.0
freedom to

4774.88 --> 4780.0
deal with bull conceptions and sci-fi

4780.08 --> 4786.239
without a problem

4782.239 --> 4788.959999999999
in the face of god because you're not

4786.239 --> 4791.678999999999
pretending like it's real

4788.96 --> 4794.2390000000005
you're not ignoring truth in order to

4791.679 --> 4797.04
entertain it

4794.239 --> 4800.4
right we can entertain

4797.04 --> 4802.32
like fairy tales obvi like fantasy

4800.4 --> 4806.638999999999
worlds

4802.32 --> 4808.5599999999995
we know like that's not the reality

4806.639 --> 4810.32
that's not physically the reality is

4808.56 --> 4813.1990000000005
that you can't just

4810.32 --> 4816.719
be entertained by it be guided by the

4813.199 --> 4819.04
same spiritual laws as your life

4816.719 --> 4820.88
right this interesting experience often

4819.04 --> 4823.12
going through what

4820.88 --> 4824.96
fictional characters go through

4823.12 --> 4827.679
how they

4824.96 --> 4829.679
in the writers conception reflect upon

4827.679 --> 4831.4400000000005
their situation yeah you learn something

4829.679 --> 4833.76
from that on the spiritual level but you

4831.44 --> 4834.5599999999995
know it's fiction

4833.76 --> 4838.320000000001
right

4834.56 --> 4838.320000000001
there nobody has a problem with that

4839.04 --> 4841.92
that's the difference

4842.56 --> 4850.639
i know the earth is flat

4846.88 --> 4853.4400000000005
but i am still very entertained

4850.639 --> 4856.32
by the idea that the earth would be a

4853.44 --> 4857.28
ball in an endless vacuum of outer space

4856.32 --> 4858.5599999999995
with

4857.28 --> 4860.96
endless

4858.56 --> 4863.76
beautiful sights and

4860.96 --> 4866.32
terrifying mysteries and infinite

4863.76 --> 4869.12
resources and puzzles and whatever yeah

4866.32 --> 4872.4
that's very cool i like that

4869.12 --> 4874.08
but i know it's never going to be real

4872.4 --> 4876.32
that's never something that people at

4874.08 --> 4879.44
some point are going to physically do

4876.32 --> 4881.5199999999995
right they might do it in heaven

4879.44 --> 4884.799999999999
in a

4881.52 --> 4886.96
virtual simulation

4884.8 --> 4889.84
given to them by god

4886.96 --> 4889.84
maybe

4890.08 --> 4894.08
it's never going to be the physical

4891.84 --> 4897.4800000000005
reality around us

4894.08 --> 4897.48
that's the difference

4905.14 --> 4909.76
[Music]

4907.52 --> 4910.719
i trust his behavior

4909.76 --> 4913.12
oh

4910.719 --> 4916.12
complaining pants professor phil bell

4913.12 --> 4916.12
please

4916.57 --> 4919.71
[Music]

4923.84 --> 4927.84
this

4924.8 --> 4930.320000000001
format fantasy format melody

4927.84 --> 4932.159000000001
i all addressed that you keep repeating

4930.32 --> 4936.679
yourself

4932.159 --> 4936.679
anyway i'll be back at two minutes

5042.0 --> 5044.48
are you doing

5055.12 --> 5059.44
what's wrong with paul steele's comment

5056.88 --> 5062.400000000001
there i don't see it paul

5059.44 --> 5062.4
pj krishan

5066.0 --> 5069.36
hey jason mccormack

5082.239 --> 5085.44
all right all right

5083.52 --> 5087.4400000000005
just a mistake

5085.44 --> 5090.799999999999
fat finger syndrome

5087.44 --> 5090.799999999999
or was it a pocket banning

5093.199 --> 5095.678999999999
never mind

5095.76 --> 5099.159000000001
he'll be back

5122.08 --> 5127.37
oh god

5124.24 --> 5127.37
[Music]

5133.04 --> 5136.04
so

5151.52 --> 5157.76
it is a trick question

5155.199 --> 5160.879999999999
divide by zero

5157.76 --> 5160.88
zero is a concept

5161.84 --> 5169.2390000000005
you gotta have a actual numerical value

5165.199 --> 5169.239
zero doesn't have any

5175.679 --> 5182.28
am i going to end this show

5177.679 --> 5182.28
tear it 306 well that all depends

5185.36 --> 5193.32
i can't keep this up forever if i'm just

5187.679 --> 5193.32
not gonna if the finances stay dried up

5213.199 --> 5218.599999999999
what am i going to do next it's none of

5215.199 --> 5218.599999999999
your damn business

5224.4 --> 5227.44
oh next project

5227.6 --> 5231.92
i don't know

5229.84 --> 5234.400000000001
let's just see what happens first i know

5231.92 --> 5235.6
if everybody just decides no no this is

5234.4 --> 5238.4
it

5235.6 --> 5240.96
irwin shouldn't be expecting more

5238.4 --> 5242.719
because it's fair enough that he just

5240.96 --> 5245.679
barely even gets

5242.719 --> 5248.32
one third of what he needs to get around

5245.679 --> 5250.639
you know that's normal now for some

5248.32 --> 5254.639
reason in your minds

5250.639 --> 5254.639
yeah no it's not doesn't work

5264.32 --> 5270.96
i need support otherwise i can't

5268.32 --> 5272.719
maintain focus on doing this

5270.96 --> 5275.28
like anything

5272.719 --> 5275.28
about this

5276.159 --> 5283.04
oh i'm sure i can just be another guy on

5278.8 --> 5283.04
the internet again periodically

5283.52 --> 5285.280000000001
but

5284.56 --> 5289.320000000001
yeah

5285.28 --> 5289.32
that's not gonna be the same

5308.639 --> 5313.4800000000005
all right jason mccormick i appreciate

5310.48 --> 5313.48
that

5330.0 --> 5333.0
do

5354.639 --> 5357.1990000000005
right so

5358.4 --> 5362.839999999999
yeah

5359.92 --> 5364.639
you know unfortunately just

5362.84 --> 5367.1990000000005
wishing

5364.639 --> 5370.159000000001
is not going to stop me from me becoming

5367.199 --> 5370.159
destitute so

5371.76 --> 5378.84
only actual financial support

5374.32 --> 5378.84
stops me from going there

5395.36 --> 5401.12
i'm holding back

5398.0 --> 5401.12
how am i holding back

5401.52 --> 5407.2390000000005
i'm not holding back by committing to

5403.6 --> 5407.2390000000005
nathan every day

5423.28 --> 5428.719
no in a way

5425.36 --> 5432.159
nathan's show being part of that

5428.719 --> 5435.199
is also a relief and it it gives me like

5432.159 --> 5438.0
a half way social life okay

5435.199 --> 5438.0
it really does

5439.04 --> 5443.44
so

5439.76 --> 5446.56
i get i probably get more out of it

5443.44 --> 5448.48
than if i wouldn't do it

5446.56 --> 5450.080000000001
yeah nathan's show is not holding me

5448.48 --> 5452.239
back

5450.08 --> 5453.6
like if i wouldn't be part of that it's

5452.239 --> 5455.919999999999
not doesn't mean that i'm gonna do

5453.6 --> 5458.320000000001
longer shows

5455.92 --> 5458.32
all right

5459.36 --> 5464.639
and he's also his show is the thing that

5463.12 --> 5466.4
does keep me

5464.639 --> 5469.04
involved with actual flat earth

5466.4 --> 5469.04
mechanics

5469.28 --> 5472.8
it does

5471.04 --> 5475.12
because they deal with it and because

5472.8 --> 5478.639
they deal with it

5475.12 --> 5481.28
into the tail i then kind of find the

5478.639 --> 5483.1990000000005
funny things in there

5481.28 --> 5486.4
that's how i get to the

5483.199 --> 5486.4
my pattern things

5489.04 --> 5491.84
right

5494.639 --> 5497.76
so yeah no i

5498.159 --> 5502.239
yeah nathan is making money yeah that's

5500.08 --> 5505.5199999999995
right that part i don't understand i

5502.239 --> 5506.718999999999
don't understand why he is getting

5505.52 --> 5509.120000000001
support

5506.719 --> 5511.12
well maybe that's just because then it

5509.12 --> 5512.48
could be suggested because of the

5511.12 --> 5514.48
physical

5512.48 --> 5518.08
effort because of the programming he

5514.48 --> 5520.08
puts into his channel

5518.08 --> 5522.88
it's more professional i guess

5520.08 --> 5525.92
professionalism just makes people roll

5522.88 --> 5525.92
out money or something

5530.239 --> 5533.4
all right

5540.32 --> 5543.63
[Music]

5552.08 --> 5556.8
yes

5554.159 --> 5558.96
thank you obviously sarah says yes i i

5556.8 --> 5561.28
do i am very well aware that i am

5558.96 --> 5563.6
contributing

5561.28 --> 5567.92
to nathan's show

5563.6 --> 5567.92
and to the legacy of it all i know that

5569.44 --> 5573.32
i'm happy about that

5577.679 --> 5584.84
so hey if you're happy about that too

5580.8 --> 5584.84
oh somebody just came home

5593.84 --> 5599.6
yeah if you're happy about that too

5596.159 --> 5599.599999999999
i have a patreon too

5601.04 --> 5607.12
now it's not a

5603.28 --> 5609.92
a gay me patreon like oh look at all the

5607.12 --> 5612.96
little thingies and the specials and

5609.92 --> 5615.6
like a micro market place to have fun

5612.96 --> 5619.44
while you're supporting somebody right

5615.6 --> 5621.92
no mine's it's just a patreon

5619.44 --> 5621.919999999999
that's it

5624.239 --> 5628.159
so

5625.84 --> 5628.159000000001
yeah

5628.32 --> 5631.84
i could definitely use it

5632.4 --> 5635.92
you know

5633.44 --> 5637.44
even just think about it if the support

5635.92 --> 5640.88
that i'd get

5637.44 --> 5640.879999999999
would gradually increase

5641.84 --> 5647.04
and my subscriber amount would increase

5644.48 --> 5647.759999999999
i'll get better at what i do

5647.04 --> 5649.76
i

5647.76 --> 5652.2390000000005
meet new interesting people maybe even

5649.76 --> 5654.159000000001
get them involved in ways and all that

5652.239 --> 5655.839999999999
and then

5654.159 --> 5657.599999999999
yeah if i

5655.84 --> 5659.92
think can you imagine that would

5657.6 --> 5661.84
suddenly get money surplus like i

5659.92 --> 5663.92
certainly can't get around easy and i

5661.84 --> 5667.679
have to spare

5663.92 --> 5667.679
well then i can actually start

5668.32 --> 5672.12
developing things

5673.199 --> 5678.08
right like nathan getting new equipment

5676.32 --> 5681.199
like a lot of it

5678.08 --> 5683.5199999999995
i could use that too

5681.199 --> 5685.759999999999
i mean i can get around my show works

5683.52 --> 5687.679
the way it does but

5685.76 --> 5691.1990000000005
it could be better well none of that's

5687.679 --> 5695.4400000000005
gonna get better with without

5691.199 --> 5698.759999999999
like way too much time being spent

5695.44 --> 5698.759999999999
or money

5706.639 --> 5714.119
so yeah it's not like it's just

5709.199 --> 5714.119
completely gonna disappear into nowhere

5723.28 --> 5726.96
ah finally everybody's catching on

5725.28 --> 5729.84
there's no nathan oakley now they're all

5726.96 --> 5733.719
frustrated

5729.84 --> 5733.719
skype is going berserk

5785.28 --> 5790.239
dividing it by zero cutting it zero

5787.6 --> 5790.2390000000005
times no

5790.56 --> 5793.679
now then

5791.84 --> 5795.92
you don't have a result

5793.679 --> 5797.76
then if you're not applying the

5795.92 --> 5800.2390000000005
calculation you don't have a result

5797.76 --> 5800.2390000000005
rachie

5800.96 --> 5806.32
because

5802.48 --> 5807.919999999999
if you divide it zero times in how you

5806.32 --> 5810.4
imagine it that would be

5807.92 --> 5814.2390000000005
one time because you have one part left

5810.4 --> 5816.08
you divide it up in one part

5814.239 --> 5821.0
see

5816.08 --> 5821.0
you can't divide it up in zero parts

5834.08 --> 5839.36
yeah it's it's kind of counterintuitive

5836.48 --> 5843.199
in a way but that's because zero is not

5839.36 --> 5843.199
real zero is a concept

5843.44 --> 5846.799999999999
it only exists in the

5852.119 --> 5855.839999999999
math hmm

5858.92 --> 5862.079
[Music]

5871.92 --> 5876.0
take away zero yeah but that's a

5874.0 --> 5879.04
different process you're not cutting it

5876.0 --> 5880.0
up in zero pieces

5879.04 --> 5882.48
you're

5880.0 --> 5885.199
detracting zero pieces that's a

5882.48 --> 5887.759999999999
different process rachie

5885.199 --> 5890.159
you cannot divide things up into zero

5887.76 --> 5890.159000000001
pieces

5890.48 --> 5894.839999999999
but you can subtract

5893.199 --> 5896.638999999999
zero

5894.84 --> 5897.679
parts

5896.639 --> 5899.52
right

5897.679 --> 5901.1990000000005
not subtracting

5899.52 --> 5903.360000000001
but you're mixing it up

5901.199 --> 5908.919999999999
when you divide something up you have to

5903.36 --> 5908.92
have pieces with the minimum of one

5925.36 --> 5929.36
that's right math doesn't re represent

5927.36 --> 5932.4
reality so that's why it's very

5929.36 --> 5934.4
complicated to then use physical real

5932.4 --> 5937.36
world examples

5934.4 --> 5939.119
to demonstrate your mathematical thing

5937.36 --> 5940.32
see

5939.119 --> 5943.04
because it's

5940.32 --> 5945.119
specifically not physical

5943.04 --> 5948.56
so it's kind of weird to then use a

5945.119 --> 5952.599999999999
physical metaphor to represent that not

5948.56 --> 5952.6
physical concept

5953.52 --> 5955.84
yeah

5956.0 --> 5960.719
all right so yeah but the thing is what

5958.8 --> 5964.2390000000005
practically is done when zero is

5960.719 --> 5967.92
involved it's always just ask okay is it

5964.239 --> 5971.759999999999
infinitely small then right

5967.92 --> 5974.639
just endless amounts of zeros and a one

5971.76 --> 5974.639
behind the comma

5975.52 --> 5981.92
but that's

5977.92 --> 5984.96
a practical application it is avoiding

5981.92 --> 5984.96
the actual issue

5989.84 --> 5996.56
because infinitely small is not

5992.84 --> 6000.0
zero but zero in however you apply

5996.56 --> 6002.96
mathematics could represent infinitely

6000.0 --> 6002.96
small you see

6004.159 --> 6006.839999999999
but it isn't

6005.6 --> 6011.719
zero is

6006.84 --> 6011.719
zero and zero is a concept

6017.87 --> 6021.05
[Music]

6024.86 --> 6028.148999999999
[Music]

6043.119 --> 6047.599999999999
christianity philosophical ramblings

6048.56 --> 6052.2390000000005
is it really popular though

6050.719 --> 6055.36
i don't know is it

6052.239 --> 6055.36
harry's cursive man

6056.719 --> 6058.56
but

6057.6 --> 6061.1990000000005
yeah

6058.56 --> 6064.719
you see there's this thing

6061.199 --> 6066.719
if i would only be talking about that

6064.719 --> 6069.04
then i'd avoid

6066.719 --> 6073.84
a whole lot of reflections

6069.04 --> 6073.84
because flat earth is very much

6074.56 --> 6078.8
another critical cornerstone it's

6077.84 --> 6083.360000000001
another

6078.8 --> 6083.360000000001
star in the fractal of stars

6083.6 --> 6090.96
the function of what is happening right

6086.8 --> 6090.96
and so yeah christianity

6091.04 --> 6095.28
considerations and

6092.96 --> 6097.44
philosophical things and even politics

6095.28 --> 6100.32
if i didn't also

6097.44 --> 6102.08
use flat earth to reflect upon all those

6100.32 --> 6104.799999999999
other things then they would be

6102.08 --> 6104.8
incomplete

6105.199 --> 6109.199
and i highlight this constantly

6107.52 --> 6111.76
because everything that happens

6109.199 --> 6113.5199999999995
typically in the flat earth psychology

6111.76 --> 6115.119000000001
situation

6113.52 --> 6118.56
also is

6115.119 --> 6122.96
quite cookie cutter reflected and

6118.56 --> 6125.1990000000005
refracted out there in the other fields

6122.96 --> 6127.44
it's the same patterns

6125.199 --> 6129.759999999999
and it needs to be highlighted because

6127.44 --> 6132.719
if you're very good at learning

6129.76 --> 6135.679
things from one system

6132.719 --> 6139.52
you might find that you're also

6135.679 --> 6142.56
will be able to apply that grip

6139.52 --> 6142.56
on the others

6142.88 --> 6145.88
right

6148.4 --> 6152.96
having a grip on flat earth and how to

6150.56 --> 6154.88
deal with people that are unwilling to

6152.96 --> 6156.08
accept it

6154.88 --> 6158.32
is a good

6156.08 --> 6162.08
ability to develop

6158.32 --> 6164.719
because of what it will help you do in

6162.08 --> 6166.5599999999995
other fields

6164.719 --> 6170.4
if you can learn to handle it some

6166.56 --> 6170.400000000001
people can some people will be just

6170.48 --> 6175.759999999999
always having difficulty with it

6173.199 --> 6177.599999999999
because there are people out there that

6175.76 --> 6180.400000000001
will just never be able to deal with it

6177.6 --> 6182.159000000001
that spent their entire lifetime

6180.4 --> 6183.92
avoiding

6182.159 --> 6185.199
dealing with it

6183.92 --> 6186.719
but that's part of what makes the

6185.199 --> 6188.48
challenge right

6186.719 --> 6191.6
it's an important

6188.48 --> 6194.0
realization to face that people do that

6191.6 --> 6194.96
and how tenacious they are at it how

6194.0 --> 6198.08
much

6194.96 --> 6199.44
concentration and energy

6198.08 --> 6202.84
and acting

6199.44 --> 6205.919999999999
bravada they spend on doing

6202.84 --> 6208.400000000001
that it's an important insight to know

6205.92 --> 6210.159
that about humanity that it works like

6208.4 --> 6214.159
that with some

6210.159 --> 6216.879999999999
it's important to balance out

6214.159 --> 6219.839999999999
insight on how the world is it was for

6216.88 --> 6219.84
me very important

6220.56 --> 6223.56
right

6234.08 --> 6237.28
it's a dead end

6237.44 --> 6240.44
wow

6248.8 --> 6252.6
what are you talking about

6263.76 --> 6268.159000000001
got to break out

6265.52 --> 6268.159000000001
what the hell

6270.4 --> 6275.4
how's that gonna work i have a freaking

6272.4 --> 6275.4
history

6275.76 --> 6280.719
flat earth is

6277.6 --> 6283.679
in what i do it's never gonna come out

6280.719 --> 6286.0
understand i will never censor

6283.679 --> 6286.0
that

6287.119 --> 6293.44
like not per default it's never coming

6290.719 --> 6295.199
out of my default do you understand

6293.44 --> 6296.96
never

6295.199 --> 6298.32
i'd rather die

6296.96 --> 6301.679
miserably

6298.32 --> 6304.88
hated by everyone or so seemingly

6301.679 --> 6306.4800000000005
than to relinquish it i will never

6304.88 --> 6308.2390000000005
relinquish it

6306.48 --> 6310.4
right doesn't mean i always have to talk

6308.239 --> 6312.4
about it and if i know

6310.4 --> 6314.879999999999
there's an individual or whatever group

6312.4 --> 6317.679
that doesn't like to go there

6314.88 --> 6319.119
then if they invite me i will be able to

6317.679 --> 6320.4800000000005
perfectly

6319.119 --> 6323.36
avoid it

6320.48 --> 6325.678999999999
not even secretly start hinting at it

6323.36 --> 6327.839999999999
compulsively like some kind of occult

6325.679 --> 6332.2390000000005
truther no i don't do that i'm not a

6327.84 --> 6335.1990000000005
savage i can actually censor myself

6332.239 --> 6337.5199999999995
in ways when it's necessary when it's

6335.199 --> 6340.239
actually necessary

6337.52 --> 6343.1990000000005
i don't do that for my default i will

6340.239 --> 6345.599999999999
never do that for my default

6343.199 --> 6347.839999999999
because it's an integral part of what i

6345.6 --> 6347.84
do

6348.4 --> 6354.119
and for my grip

6350.159 --> 6354.119
on reality itself

6381.52 --> 6385.84
yeah rachie

6382.88 --> 6389.2390000000005
you can't divide your cake by zero and

6385.84 --> 6389.2390000000005
eat it too

6408.48 --> 6414.599999999999
but that's okay i'm just joking

6411.119 --> 6414.599999999999
although it's true

6419.52 --> 6422.52
so

6433.199 --> 6437.599999999999
but again rachie you're talking about

6435.84 --> 6440.159000000001
cutting a cake

6437.6 --> 6441.4400000000005
zero times right

6440.159 --> 6443.839999999999
well that means

6441.44 --> 6445.759999999999
what that effectively means is you

6443.84 --> 6447.679
not dividing it

6445.76 --> 6450.56
you're not engaging in dividing it

6447.679 --> 6453.119
because you have zero cuts zero times

6450.56 --> 6456.8
you're engaging in dividing it

6453.119 --> 6460.5599999999995
what actually is the numerical value in

6456.8 --> 6463.1990000000005
a division calculation is the amount of

6460.56 --> 6463.1990000000005
pieces

6464.239 --> 6466.638999999999
you see

6468.159 --> 6473.28
you can't have zero

6470.4 --> 6476.48
for the amount of pieces that will come

6473.28 --> 6476.48
out of the division

6477.92 --> 6483.639
that's the issue it's not about how many

6480.08 --> 6483.639
cuts you make

6494.639 --> 6501.6
some of my what are you talking about

6499.28 --> 6501.599999999999
dude

6506.96 --> 6512.639
what do you think you can rile me up

6508.8 --> 6515.52
into some petty hostile attitude who the

6512.639 --> 6519.679
[ __ ] you think i am aries

6515.52 --> 6519.679
are you trying to start a war here

6519.84 --> 6525.56
it's very your name and very petty

6534.96 --> 6540.04
no no fed today it's just me

6541.38 --> 6544.55
[Music]

6549.44 --> 6555.239
oh by the way hello crack filling in

6551.199 --> 6555.239
chat and ben white

6560.48 --> 6565.598999999999
nasa recruitment

6563.679 --> 6569.2390000000005
okay

6565.599 --> 6569.2390000000005
casual info

6573.76 --> 6579.1990000000005
9 times 0 should actually equal 9 no

6578.239 --> 6584.08
no

6579.199 --> 6584.08
anything times 0 is zero

6584.239 --> 6589.36
because zero is not a numerical value

6592.96 --> 6597.28
like that connection

6594.719 --> 6599.28
is a numeric now it's not a value it's

6597.28 --> 6600.8
it is a number it's not a numerical

6599.28 --> 6602.639
value though

6600.8 --> 6604.639
it's not

6602.639 --> 6606.56
something that could be expressed in

6604.639 --> 6608.08
physical reality

6606.56 --> 6611.21
that's the problem that's the whole

6608.08 --> 6613.76
issue here

6611.21 --> 6616.719
[Music]

6613.76 --> 6619.52
like these are the things that i did

6616.719 --> 6622.159
learn in math school

6619.52 --> 6625.4400000000005
because i was the one that was

6622.159 --> 6625.44
thinking like rachie

6626.159 --> 6630.32
and i was have like discussions hours

6628.719 --> 6632.4
and hours

6630.32 --> 6635.36
about that with my brother until he got

6632.4 --> 6638.96
completely sick of it

6635.36 --> 6643.28
but it did make me learn did make me

6638.96 --> 6646.159
realize that yeah zero is just a concept

6643.28 --> 6648.8
you can't actually divide something up

6646.159 --> 6648.799999999999
by zero

6650.88 --> 6655.76
and if you multiply something by zero

6652.8 --> 6655.76
there is nothing

6657.76 --> 6662.400000000001
and you could philosophically approach

6659.76 --> 6663.360000000001
that by saying okay zero is infinitely

6662.4 --> 6665.5199999999995
small

6663.36 --> 6667.759999999999
so if you divide something by infinitely

6665.52 --> 6670.159000000001
small then effectively it's going to

6667.76 --> 6672.08
become infinitely small

6670.159 --> 6675.5199999999995
times that amount which is going to be

6672.08 --> 6677.599
infinitely small anyway zero

6675.52 --> 6678.96
if you divide something up by infinitely

6677.599 --> 6682.56
small then you're going to have an

6678.96 --> 6685.36
infinitely large amount of parts

6682.56 --> 6687.119000000001
and then you get infinity

6685.36 --> 6691.679
right that's the other philosophical

6687.119 --> 6695.5199999999995
approach you divide a number up by zero

6691.679 --> 6699.2390000000005
and then you have infinite

6695.52 --> 6699.2390000000005
this is not practical

6701.7 --> 6704.898999999999
[Music]

6720.04 --> 6723.26
[Music]

6731.44 --> 6737.839999999999
not all infinities are oh come on rachie

6739.44 --> 6743.36
infinity lives matters really

6743.76 --> 6750.679
everybody's special unique even if

6746.239 --> 6750.678999999999
they're just infinite okay

6751.76 --> 6755.76
sure infinitely big infinitely small

6754.159 --> 6758.799999999999
it's the two i

6755.76 --> 6761.4400000000005
this those are the two infinites

6758.8 --> 6764.4400000000005
mathematically infinitely big infinitely

6761.44 --> 6764.44
small

6778.239 --> 6782.959999999999
what no seeking no zero

6783.52 --> 6786.2390000000005
oh god

6789.679 --> 6795.1990000000005
look zero in math when you just use zero

6792.719 --> 6796.639
it's just zero

6795.199 --> 6798.638999999999
which means

6796.639 --> 6801.36
zero

6798.639 --> 6804.84
if you're but if you're going to

6801.36 --> 6807.92
use math to compare to a real

6804.84 --> 6809.84
situation then zero can't be zero

6807.92 --> 6812.32
because zero doesn't exist so you have

6809.84 --> 6815.76
to then replace the idea of zero with

6812.32 --> 6818.32
infinitely small but that means

6815.76 --> 6821.04
it's not that math anymore

6818.32 --> 6822.5599999999995
it's something else

6821.04 --> 6824.56
because

6822.56 --> 6827.360000000001
if you're comparing it to reality it

6824.56 --> 6830.56
can't be that math because in reality

6827.36 --> 6832.159
zero doesn't exist

6830.56 --> 6836.400000000001
you can't

6832.159 --> 6839.199
divide by zero you can't multiply

6836.4 --> 6839.199
by zero

6845.04 --> 6852.5199999999995
concept plus concept this concept yes

6849.52 --> 6852.52
right

6865.76 --> 6871.159000000001
don't don't talk to people in my chat

6867.92 --> 6871.159
like that

6884.639 --> 6891.84
concept times zero is zero yeah

6888.159 --> 6891.839999999999
anything times zero is zero

6911.679 --> 6914.88
see isn't it ironic

6916.239 --> 6922.959999999999
i'm not like i don't like math

6919.84 --> 6925.1990000000005
but i do get math

6922.96 --> 6925.199
see

6925.36 --> 6931.5199999999995
i'm not good at processing math

6928.96 --> 6935.199
but i understand math

6931.52 --> 6935.1990000000005
that's how i made it through school

6935.84 --> 6939.599
with math class

6937.679 --> 6942.32
even though i barely showed up because i

6939.599 --> 6942.32
just got it

6942.4 --> 6946.839999999999
not good at it but i get it

6949.92 --> 6954.88
i understand what's happening

6952.96 --> 6957.04
and i understand the mistakes between

6954.88 --> 6961.719
the conceptual and comparing them to the

6957.04 --> 6961.719
physical i got good at that part

6967.04 --> 6970.239
hello explain how

6970.719 --> 6974.4
yeah we got an extra long show today

6972.639 --> 6977.400000000001
because there's no flat earth debate

6974.4 --> 6977.4
live

6994.56 --> 7000.0
hey moby styles

6997.36 --> 7003.5599999999995
thank you for the super chat donation

7000.0 --> 7003.56
appreciate it

7003.679 --> 7006.719
the first one today

7014.0 --> 7017.36
right

7015.36 --> 7018.639
now when i was younger and in school

7017.36 --> 7023.36
especially

7018.639 --> 7023.36
i was really into map drawing

7024.0 --> 7028.56
like just like make maps make

7028.84 --> 7035.04
worlds just map and let it come into

7032.4 --> 7035.04
existence

7036.719 --> 7040.4800000000005
and make stories in there too

7038.88 --> 7043.119
like just

7040.48 --> 7044.799999999999
creating a world and then deciding oh

7043.119 --> 7046.799999999999
this is there that is there

7044.8 --> 7048.76
according to different orders that i

7046.8 --> 7052.2390000000005
would also make

7048.76 --> 7054.8
categorizations of creatures and things

7052.239 --> 7054.799999999999
elements

7056.32 --> 7060.239
and was doing that a lot it was just

7058.08 --> 7061.36
drawing maps like in the middle of

7060.239 --> 7063.759999999999
school

7061.36 --> 7066.08
even in breaks i was also like playing a

7063.76 --> 7066.08
lot of

7066.4 --> 7072.44
magic the gathering especially back then

7069.04 --> 7072.44
lots of that

7073.119 --> 7078.0
but maps man always maps i still have

7075.679 --> 7078.0
them all

7078.239 --> 7081.28
it's not all of it is here in my room

7080.4 --> 7084.0
but

7081.28 --> 7086.0
i think i showed it quite a few

7084.0 --> 7088.08
i was just very good but not even

7086.0 --> 7090.4
cartography just

7088.08 --> 7091.28
drawing maps it wasn't even like oh this

7090.4 --> 7094.5599999999995
is

7091.28 --> 7097.36
i didn't even understand

7094.56 --> 7099.4400000000005
like maps like what

7097.36 --> 7101.598999999999
that they were projections for example

7099.44 --> 7103.678999999999
right i didn't know that i was just like

7101.599 --> 7106.0
no i'm just gonna draw a freaking map

7103.679 --> 7108.2390000000005
it's just gonna be a square piece of

7106.0 --> 7110.239
paper i'm just gonna

7108.239 --> 7112.5599999999995
make it the continent here continent

7110.239 --> 7114.48
there

7112.56 --> 7118.159000000001
this there that there

7114.48 --> 7120.48
re erase parts redo it

7118.159 --> 7122.4
and then just like okay

7120.48 --> 7124.08
this is where these

7122.4 --> 7126.239
this people is gonna live that is where

7124.08 --> 7129.84
that people is gonna live

7126.239 --> 7129.839999999999
yeah it was always flat

7130.32 --> 7136.239
i it is funny because i've been a fan

7134.56 --> 7138.719
of sci-fi

7136.239 --> 7140.879999999999
but when i would draw maps it was always

7138.719 --> 7143.28
just flat i didn't even think like oh is

7140.88 --> 7145.84
this going to fit on a sphere no

7143.28 --> 7149.84
it literally never entered my mind i

7145.84 --> 7151.52
somehow managed to compartmentalize that

7149.84 --> 7154.96
it's very odd

7151.52 --> 7157.84
so it separated the sci-fi

7154.96 --> 7157.84
universe from

7158.639 --> 7161.1990000000005
yeah more

7162.159 --> 7168.08
historical themed and

7166.08 --> 7171.04
uh

7168.08 --> 7172.88
medieval fantasy type

7171.04 --> 7174.639
realms

7172.88 --> 7177.36
mind realms

7174.639 --> 7180.400000000001
like never mix that like oh this to be

7177.36 --> 7183.119
globe never that just didn't happen i

7180.4 --> 7184.96
never had a globifying obsession where

7183.119 --> 7187.199
i'd had to make everything fit the

7184.96 --> 7190.08
freaking globe never had that

7187.199 --> 7190.08
just didn't care

7194.96 --> 7200.2390000000005
when did i first hear the concept about

7197.04 --> 7200.239
flat earth proof

7202.32 --> 7207.84
well where i'm certain about it

7205.199 --> 7213.598999999999
pretty much is when i was 12 i think my

7207.84 --> 7215.92
parents confronted me with it through

7213.599 --> 7218.32
maps

7215.92 --> 7218.32
and

7218.719 --> 7223.44
older books because there's been like

7221.04 --> 7226.88
flat earth related books

7223.44 --> 7229.119
like since the 60s i think

7226.88 --> 7232.56
there were just like rare books that

7229.119 --> 7232.5599999999995
nobody really talked about

7234.96 --> 7237.599
so yeah i was

7236.48 --> 7239.44
like

7237.599 --> 7241.28
confronted with it

7239.44 --> 7244.0
but it was just like

7241.28 --> 7246.48
a moment like a dream moment

7244.0 --> 7248.719
where it's just like whoa there's this

7246.48 --> 7250.799999999999
giant legacy

7248.719 --> 7253.199
what to me still kind of felt like oh

7250.8 --> 7254.4800000000005
this is just another lore this is could

7253.199 --> 7256.96
be fantasy

7254.48 --> 7259.28
it didn't really matter

7256.96 --> 7261.199
so i just took it

7259.28 --> 7263.44
thought about it reflected on it and

7261.199 --> 7266.08
then kind of like got distracted and it

7263.44 --> 7267.598999999999
just drifted away

7266.08 --> 7270.88
and also

7267.599 --> 7270.88
i didn't like

7271.28 --> 7276.5599999999995
doing what i do now and that is shove

7274.08 --> 7278.32
the inconvenient things that people

7276.56 --> 7279.360000000001
typically get triggered by in their

7278.32 --> 7282.5599999999995
faces

7279.36 --> 7284.719
i always avoided that because i was

7282.56 --> 7287.599
sensitive and i hated it when people got

7284.719 --> 7290.639
angry at me i hated it

7287.599 --> 7292.8
so knowing it and then seeing certain

7290.639 --> 7294.96
people have overreactions to it

7292.8 --> 7298.159000000001
immediately made me forget everything

7294.96 --> 7299.44
about it because it was dangerous

7298.159 --> 7302.96
for my

7299.44 --> 7302.96
psychological welfare

7305.199 --> 7312.0
and instead of constantly being paranoid

7307.92 --> 7314.719
about what i knew i would just forget it

7312.0 --> 7317.199
and then it wouldn't i would literally

7314.719 --> 7319.119
forget it it wouldn't exist anymore to

7317.199 --> 7321.04
me

7319.119 --> 7322.88
and then that be

7321.04 --> 7325.04
a bit of a shock when you get reminded

7322.88 --> 7327.599
later that it does exist

7325.04 --> 7329.36
again and every then everything comes

7327.599 --> 7331.76
back to memory

7329.36 --> 7334.32
but it would always

7331.76 --> 7336.400000000001
just forget about it again

7334.32 --> 7338.719
because of the consequences of people

7336.4 --> 7340.5599999999995
always getting triggered and like

7338.719 --> 7344.08
triggered on all levels

7340.56 --> 7344.080000000001
the young the older

7344.32 --> 7348.08
it's just

7345.52 --> 7351.1990000000005
it was a permanent no-go zone for me

7348.08 --> 7353.36
because i was too vulnerable

7351.199 --> 7355.04
and that's why probably overall

7353.36 --> 7357.199
throughout my life been confronted with

7355.04 --> 7358.8
it for like five times

7357.199 --> 7361.839999999999
starting pretty young

7358.8 --> 7363.92
and i just would forget it again as soon

7361.84 --> 7367.4400000000005
as i realized that i wouldn't be able to

7363.92 --> 7369.52
do anything with it just get

7367.44 --> 7373.839999999999
a lot of people very triggered towards

7369.52 --> 7373.84
me and then start to ruin my life

7378.4 --> 7383.119
and that is not like in chat that's

7380.639 --> 7385.599
actually ruining your life

7383.119 --> 7388.598999999999
yeah where you're forced to go bullying

7385.599 --> 7388.599
[ __ ]

7393.71 --> 7399.04
[Music]

7396.8 --> 7399.04
ah

7400.08 --> 7404.32
so yeah kind of forgot about all of it

7406.639 --> 7409.84
but now it's different

7410.28 --> 7415.92
2015 i made

7413.76 --> 7419.679
it was a terrifying

7415.92 --> 7423.4400000000005
moment but i just said okay

7419.679 --> 7425.679
i know now this is more real than

7423.44 --> 7427.678999999999
everything else that was left from the

7425.679 --> 7429.84
other side

7427.679 --> 7431.679
which is constantly drifting makes you

7429.84 --> 7434.0
forget about everything

7431.679 --> 7435.4400000000005
so i just knew that is

7434.0 --> 7438.639
real

7435.44 --> 7441.678999999999
and to accept what is real

7438.639 --> 7444.639
is just going to be a

7441.679 --> 7446.4
situation full of ruckus and friction

7444.639 --> 7447.36
and there's nothing i can do about it

7446.4 --> 7450.5599999999995
but i

7447.36 --> 7453.119
i want to move on with my intellectual

7450.56 --> 7453.119000000001
development

7453.52 --> 7459.119000000001
so i have to go there and pay the price

7456.159 --> 7462.719
become a freaking flat earther

7459.119 --> 7465.839999999999
get isolated more than ever before

7462.719 --> 7467.44
but not

7465.84 --> 7469.4400000000005
completely

7467.44 --> 7470.96
there's others

7469.44 --> 7472.799999999999
that was the condition

7470.96 --> 7475.199
the flat earth awakening

7472.8 --> 7477.4400000000005
lots of people suddenly hearing about

7475.199 --> 7479.119
lots of people be getting enthusiastic

7477.44 --> 7481.44
for it

7479.119 --> 7484.079
that was the necessary

7481.44 --> 7486.879999999999
antecedent for me to dare and actually

7484.079 --> 7489.119
make it official

7486.88 --> 7493.04
and that making official was mostly

7489.119 --> 7496.079
making it real and official in my mind

7493.04 --> 7499.44
by literally putting it out there

7496.079 --> 7501.759999999999
making it real to me so that i wouldn't

7499.44 --> 7504.239
be able to forget it again wouldn't be

7501.76 --> 7506.4800000000005
able to retreat from the inconvenient

7504.239 --> 7508.239
situation

7506.48 --> 7510.799999999999
where i was always gonna have that

7508.239 --> 7512.5599999999995
sticking in my mind

7510.8 --> 7515.360000000001
knowing that so many people get

7512.56 --> 7515.360000000001
triggered by it

7517.76 --> 7525.119000000001
because to do that in a world where you

7520.639 --> 7528.4800000000005
are convinced you are absolutely alone

7525.119 --> 7528.48
is unbearable

7529.04 --> 7534.76
i needed to see that i wouldn't be alone

7535.76 --> 7539.679
oh my god are you still talking about

7537.599 --> 7542.679
that math stuff

7539.679 --> 7542.679
sheesh

7568.239 --> 7572.28
i came across as a glower

7578.88 --> 7583.36
i was trolling on nathan's show

7581.84 --> 7586.88
was i trolling

7583.36 --> 7586.88
how was i trolling men white

7586.96 --> 7589.96
how

7592.719 --> 7596.2390000000005
if you mean that i was constantly

7594.639 --> 7598.639
reminding everybody

7596.239 --> 7599.759999999999
that like no the earth is not a disc

7598.639 --> 7604.32
with a

7599.76 --> 7606.56
a ball of light floating over it

7604.32 --> 7607.759999999999
if i was actively countering those

7606.56 --> 7610.0
argument

7607.76 --> 7612.400000000001
well that wasn't trolling if that's what

7610.0 --> 7617.8
you mean

7612.4 --> 7617.799999999999
i've always had a persistent case

7620.56 --> 7624.4800000000005
when it concerns the the holographic

7622.719 --> 7626.639
globe of the heavens

7624.48 --> 7629.598999999999
special non-linearity for the looping

7626.639 --> 7629.599
rectangular earth

7630.079 --> 7634.4
and i still kind of latched on to

7632.159 --> 7636.799999999999
gravity at first but that's before i

7634.4 --> 7639.119
completely understood science what the

7636.8 --> 7642.2390000000005
scientific method was

7639.119 --> 7644.839999999999
it took some time to basically

7642.239 --> 7647.598999999999
perfect that

7644.84 --> 7649.360000000001
insight and yeah relative density and

7647.599 --> 7650.56
all that that's a whole process by

7649.36 --> 7653.5199999999995
itself but

7650.56 --> 7656.88
the original things i started out with

7653.52 --> 7660.0
it they people kind of saw me as a pj

7656.88 --> 7663.1990000000005
like oh weird arwyn ideas ooh

7660.0 --> 7665.92
holographic son oh sure arwen oh yeah

7663.199 --> 7668.4
look at where we are now huh

7665.92 --> 7671.1990000000005
i really like to rub people's faces in

7668.4 --> 7675.638999999999
that like really like to rub them into

7671.199 --> 7675.638999999999
it because i've had to be the one

7676.8 --> 7680.8
that was just being mocked for it at

7678.88 --> 7685.96
first i thought people thought it

7680.8 --> 7685.96
genuinely thought it was crazy for that

7688.8 --> 7693.599
i was arguing if i were defending

7691.119 --> 7697.36
heliocentric model

7693.599 --> 7701.88
no no i wasn't i was just i didn't like

7697.36 --> 7701.88
when people got the mechanics wrong

7704.56 --> 7709.04
right the mechanics of the globe

7709.119 --> 7714.32
i don't like it when people

7711.199 --> 7716.799999999999
say oh it's a stupid globe

7714.32 --> 7720.639
and then they get it wrong i know a lot

7716.8 --> 7723.4400000000005
of ballers find that very annoying too

7720.639 --> 7726.400000000001
and there was a lot of that

7723.44 --> 7728.32
because yeah if people would just say oh

7726.4 --> 7730.638999999999
so the ball is wrong

7728.32 --> 7733.84
well that means i can just [ __ ] talk

7730.639 --> 7737.1990000000005
about it like a complete [ __ ]

7733.84 --> 7738.88
and like say it's wrong based on a

7737.199 --> 7741.199
reflection that proves that you

7738.88 --> 7742.719
absolutely don't understand how it's

7741.199 --> 7744.638999999999
supposed to be

7742.719 --> 7746.639
according to the system that you don't

7744.639 --> 7748.719
understand the system yet you are very

7746.639 --> 7749.52
adamant about saying it's wrong right

7748.719 --> 7752.4800000000005
that's

7749.52 --> 7753.52
super annoying and foolish

7752.48 --> 7755.678999999999
bad

7753.52 --> 7757.92
bad karma

7755.679 --> 7761.28
people did that a lot and it pissed me

7757.92 --> 7762.56
off so yeah i ended up correcting a lot

7761.28 --> 7764.8
of

7762.56 --> 7766.159000000001
flat earther assumptions about globe

7764.8 --> 7768.56
mechanics

7766.159 --> 7772.92
i will still do that

7768.56 --> 7772.92
i still do that to this day

7775.599 --> 7779.92
because i just don't want flat earthers

7779.199 --> 7782.239
to

7779.92 --> 7786.119
not pay attention to something just

7782.239 --> 7786.119
because they think it's fake

7794.4 --> 7797.4
do

7804.079 --> 7807.5199999999995
i think out of the box

7808.719 --> 7814.84
well yeah

7810.239 --> 7814.839999999999
or just i have a lot of different boxes

7834.32 --> 7841.119
hmm okay interesting gaining wisdom

7837.52 --> 7841.119000000001
arrested the other why

7841.679 --> 7849.56
at least you got some

7844.32 --> 7849.5599999999995
some c info across that's good

7856.56 --> 7862.56
wow steaming traveler for real

7860.159 --> 7865.92
my model of flat earth harder because it

7862.56 --> 7867.599
makes sense the only one

7865.92 --> 7869.04
does it

7867.599 --> 7872.2390000000005
but my model

7869.04 --> 7875.04
my model is not really a

7872.239 --> 7877.5199999999995
singular model it's like a framework of

7875.04 --> 7880.56
options based on things

7877.52 --> 7882.8
that could potentially be

7880.56 --> 7882.8
so

7883.44 --> 7888.32
i just keep track of the issues that

7886.56 --> 7890.0
make things difficult

7888.32 --> 7893.28
i don't try to

7890.0 --> 7895.679
like ignore some element like

7893.28 --> 7897.36
oh yeah the disc is not actually to

7895.679 --> 7898.96
scale just like the globe is not the

7897.36 --> 7900.639
scale ah

7898.96 --> 7902.56
right oh there's a lot of flat earthers

7900.639 --> 7906.079
that like to just know

7902.56 --> 7909.1990000000005
oh but it it's so handy

7906.079 --> 7911.28
it's you can make a beautiful cgi about

7909.199 --> 7912.879999999999
it and no

7911.28 --> 7914.88
yeah yeah

7912.88 --> 7916.96
and i get that

7914.88 --> 7918.88
convenience right i'm the one that's

7916.96 --> 7920.56
going to get in there and say like no no

7918.88 --> 7922.639
it's not the scale this is not an actual

7920.56 --> 7925.599
representation

7922.639 --> 7926.8
and then not offer a cookie cutter

7925.599 --> 7929.92
alternative

7926.8 --> 7932.4800000000005
like no this is exactly it instead no i

7929.92 --> 7934.079
just lay out here's the complexities

7932.48 --> 7936.239
here's the issues that have not been

7934.079 --> 7938.239
resolved yet this is what we could do to

7936.239 --> 7940.32
figure it out

7938.239 --> 7942.159
the suggestion of potential spatial

7940.32 --> 7944.0
non-linearity

7942.159 --> 7946.159
playing a part

7944.0 --> 7949.159
in how the realm

7946.159 --> 7949.159
works

7958.159 --> 7962.719
yeah so i'm always that guy that's going

7959.84 --> 7965.599
to be very inconvenient

7962.719 --> 7967.92
but still very relevant it just takes

7965.599 --> 7970.0
some time before people get there

7967.92 --> 7973.599
typically

7970.0 --> 7976.0
i'm the too soon guy

7973.599 --> 7980.4400000000005
the early bird

7976.0 --> 7980.44
the too soon guy i like that

7988.88 --> 7994.079
right but eventually too soon just

7991.28 --> 7995.599
becomes just in time

7994.079 --> 7998.5599999999995
then if

7995.599 --> 8000.639
depending on how things flow forth

7998.56 --> 8003.599
then too soon might eventually even

8000.639 --> 8003.599
become too late

8004.32 --> 8006.88
i don't know

8008.4 --> 8013.92
now that

8011.119 --> 8015.839999999999
now that's technically incorrect

8013.92 --> 8018.2390000000005
sound is really interesting though but

8015.84 --> 8020.8
that's that's like a philosophical

8018.239 --> 8020.799999999999
paradox

8023.119 --> 8027.119
yeah if it's too late then it's not too

8024.88 --> 8027.119
soon

8027.76 --> 8032.56
although yeah contextually depends on

8030.0 --> 8032.56
where you are

8036.239 --> 8041.199
what can be too soon for some can be too

8039.44 --> 8044.879999999999
late for others

8041.199 --> 8044.879999999999
right yeah that'll fix it

8044.96 --> 8048.079
anyway

8046.48 --> 8052.159
i think i'm gonna move

8048.079 --> 8055.44
somewhere towards rounding out the show

8052.159 --> 8055.44
already past two hours

8057.119 --> 8061.199
i'm getting a little hungry oh my god

8059.119 --> 8063.28
look at the

8061.199 --> 8064.48
weather

8063.28 --> 8067.84
yeah

8064.48 --> 8067.839999999999
it started raining

8069.199 --> 8072.199
yuck

8080.8 --> 8084.56
it was released mood was different see

8082.719 --> 8086.96
it changes their thinking behavior

8084.56 --> 8089.52
that's good

8086.96 --> 8091.679
i've actually found in this very sparing

8089.52 --> 8092.96
experience that i've had with some cops

8091.679 --> 8095.4400000000005
here

8092.96 --> 8097.44
none of them bad experiences really

8095.44 --> 8100.159
i found that

8097.44 --> 8103.28
they're actually very receptive to

8100.159 --> 8105.36
enlightening info

8103.28 --> 8107.679
and not just like uh yeah yeah keep

8105.36 --> 8109.839999999999
talking oh we got it under control now

8107.679 --> 8109.84
they

8110.88 --> 8114.96
a lot of cops out there are like

8113.04 --> 8118.4
interested

8114.96 --> 8121.639
in spiritual development

8118.4 --> 8121.638999999999
it's interesting

8122.159 --> 8126.96
that that's overall why i think

8124.239 --> 8128.718999999999
personally that the police force here in

8126.96 --> 8130.159
this city utrecht here in the

8128.719 --> 8133.8
netherlands

8130.159 --> 8133.799999999999
is pretty decent

8136.4 --> 8142.719
i think they're good compared to some

8138.639 --> 8142.719
other regions that is you know

8144.48 --> 8147.598999999999
yeah try the cops in the states i know

8146.4 --> 8150.32
but they've

8147.599 --> 8152.719
had issues for a very long time but that

8150.32 --> 8154.719
is also regional right

8152.719 --> 8156.56
owen benjamin has talked about this a

8154.719 --> 8158.8
couple of times

8156.56 --> 8160.400000000001
it all depends on where you are in the

8158.8 --> 8163.119000000001
states

8160.4 --> 8164.5599999999995
some police forces are like very on

8163.119 --> 8166.719
point

8164.56 --> 8168.8
they don't get manipulated or

8166.719 --> 8172.719
politicized

8168.8 --> 8178.0
usually smaller departments in

8172.719 --> 8179.599
in non-city regions and they do great

8178.0 --> 8182.239
then

8179.599 --> 8184.079
yeah even some cities

8182.239 --> 8186.32
don't necessarily have to be all that

8184.079 --> 8186.32
bad

8186.719 --> 8189.92
yeah so it all depends on the region you

8188.56 --> 8191.599
know it's

8189.92 --> 8194.24
like what is the morale of the

8191.599 --> 8194.24
department

8194.719 --> 8197.919999999998
what's the corruption level what is the

8196.96 --> 8201.919999999998
morale

8197.92 --> 8201.92
yeah it all depends per department

8205.439 --> 8210.08
but right over here i get the feeling

8207.92 --> 8214.12
it's pretty good

8210.08 --> 8214.12
for like a world standard

8222.8 --> 8226.96
at least i get the feeling that they

8224.559 --> 8230.319
take it very very serious and that they

8226.96 --> 8234.719
do have a sense of vigilance

8230.319 --> 8236.319
where they actually care to be vigilant

8234.719 --> 8237.678999999998
that's what i found

8236.319 --> 8240.679
overall

8237.679 --> 8240.679
anyway

8254.8 --> 8259.88
lots of cops are amazing oh of course

8256.719 --> 8259.88
they are

8262.24 --> 8266.88
that does seem to be very much

8265.28 --> 8269.439
a part of

8266.88 --> 8271.518999999998
police forces

8269.439 --> 8276.84
i think it's been like that for for a

8271.519 --> 8276.84
very long time too weird but yes

8276.88 --> 8280.559
that's been my experience as well

8282.479 --> 8288.0
okay get there

8285.599 --> 8290.639000000001
are you serious

8288.0 --> 8292.319
clone show hollywood actor you better

8290.639 --> 8295.759999999998
not be serious this is going to be the

8292.319 --> 8299.119999999999
last time you're here in my chat

8295.76 --> 8299.12
that's ridiculous

8299.359 --> 8305.84
only at an ignorant troll baiting person

8302.8 --> 8305.84
would say such a thing

8306.559 --> 8312.0
now if there's something about what he

8308.88 --> 8314.08
does that you don't like

8312.0 --> 8316.24
i get that

8314.08 --> 8319.039999999999
yeah he is a

8316.24 --> 8321.28
sacred cow slaughter guy and he really

8319.04 --> 8323.04
does that so yeah you might have heard

8321.28 --> 8326.479000000001
something from him that you think like

8323.04 --> 8329.439
no that's that's bad

8326.479 --> 8331.279999999999
but he's not a freaking chill hollywood

8329.439 --> 8333.84
actor that's

8331.28 --> 8333.84
that is like

8335.679 --> 8340.8
that's like saying nathan oakley is

8337.76 --> 8340.800000000001
secretly a baller

8340.96 --> 8346.119999999999
really

8342.559 --> 8346.119999999999
it's that level

8358.16 --> 8363.28
right and own benjamin has gone through

8360.319 --> 8366.399
a whole bunch of development

8363.28 --> 8367.679
like sizable development that you can

8366.399 --> 8369.84
see in

8367.679 --> 8370.8
what he does his expressions what he's

8369.84 --> 8373.359
learned

8370.8 --> 8375.759999999998
dude oh benjamin is one of the guys that

8373.359 --> 8378.399000000001
actually freaking embraces and tries to

8375.76 --> 8380.719000000001
work with and explains fractal thinking

8378.399 --> 8380.719
okay

8383.599 --> 8388.72
like he's explained a lot he's put a lot

8386.0 --> 8391.359
of information in a very good way out

8388.72 --> 8394.358999999999
there on a high level it really is high

8391.359 --> 8394.359
level

8406.399 --> 8409.599999999999
it should be night

8410.319 --> 8414.8
yeah well math doesn't really work with

8412.479 --> 8417.119999999999
should be ragey

8414.8 --> 8419.759999999998
math just does what math does and if you

8417.12 --> 8419.76
disagree

8423.68 --> 8425.92
there's nothing

8425.04 --> 8429.439
really

8425.92 --> 8431.12
anybody's can do about that really then

8429.439 --> 8435.2
you just have a

8431.12 --> 8435.2
dislike for how math works

8436.16 --> 8438.8
i'm sorry

8440.88 --> 8445.839999999998
owen triggers the feminists and gammas

8443.04 --> 8445.84
yeah

8469.84 --> 8479.629
uh

8472.31 --> 8479.628999999999
[Music]

8481.68 --> 8486.720000000001
uh no wait

8483.68 --> 8489.04
yes steamy traveler richie i don't know

8486.72 --> 8490.8
maybe she just has a hiccup there in the

8489.04 --> 8492.640000000001
math

8490.8 --> 8494.08
so a lot of people have that hiccup by

8492.64 --> 8495.76
the way i've seen a lot of people it

8494.08 --> 8498.0
doesn't make you dumb

8495.76 --> 8500.960000000001
it's just that

8498.0 --> 8503.68
your intuition refuses to agree with how

8500.96 --> 8507.039999999999
that works i've tried to explain it in

8503.68 --> 8510.56
detail exactly where the mistake is it's

8507.04 --> 8511.52
it's like a context fallacy

8510.56 --> 8513.199999999999
but

8511.52 --> 8514.479000000001
that's very hard to get through to

8513.2 --> 8516.240000000002
people

8514.479 --> 8519.119999999999
when they have that it doesn't make you

8516.24 --> 8520.64
stupid it just makes your intuition not

8519.12 --> 8523.92
agree

8520.64 --> 8523.92
with what's going on

8524.24 --> 8527.6
nothing

8525.12 --> 8529.359
i've seen this before okay

8527.6 --> 8532.16
that happened in school there were

8529.359 --> 8532.16
people like that

8532.88 --> 8537.92
i remember having

8534.96 --> 8540.919999999998
been part of stretch conversations

8537.92 --> 8540.92
anyway

8548.08 --> 8551.039999999999
this is

8549.439 --> 8553.2
eric dubai

8551.04 --> 8554.720000000001
and the documentary smarter than the

8553.2 --> 8558.560000000001
average bear

8554.72 --> 8558.56
who is this special boy

8559.28 --> 8563.92
don't you do messenger

8561.76 --> 8567.04
yeah well to each their own you know

8563.92 --> 8571.84
some people like

8567.04 --> 8571.84
a certain frequency of doing things

8580.08 --> 8583.28
the average bear

8583.76 --> 8587.439
what does that even mean what's the

8585.2 --> 8588.720000000001
average bear are you saying that the

8587.439 --> 8590.479000000001
average

8588.72 --> 8591.76
eric dube

8590.479 --> 8594.56
fan

8591.76 --> 8598.12
is smarter than the average owen

8594.56 --> 8598.119999999999
benjamin follower

8599.359 --> 8602.479000000001
how about the peaks

8606.399 --> 8611.199999999999
ever thought of comparing those

8609.359 --> 8612.399000000001
like owen benjamin

8611.2 --> 8616.319000000001
is

8612.399 --> 8618.08
surrounded by smart people

8616.319 --> 8622.479
is that

8618.08 --> 8622.479
does that also account for eric debay

8623.77 --> 8627.84
[Music]

8625.439 --> 8627.84
right

8639.04 --> 8644.640000000001
right i still appreciate eric debato

8641.52 --> 8644.640000000001
sort of in ways

8646.24 --> 8650.56
i mean he's made some he's a good

8648.0 --> 8652.24
narrator okay he's good at that and he's

8650.56 --> 8654.96
made

8652.24 --> 8657.6
decent videos and also

8654.96 --> 8659.919999999998
measurably getting better at it so yeah

8657.6 --> 8662.24
he's he's cool

8659.92 --> 8665.359
it's cool in my book

8662.24 --> 8667.84
but yeah savonier that has that

8665.359 --> 8670.0
he still has those tendencies but i

8667.84 --> 8672.56
think he's aware of that he takes it

8670.0 --> 8674.96
serious and he's done a lot a lot of

8672.56 --> 8676.479
work on himself

8674.96 --> 8681.16
it's good

8676.479 --> 8681.16
that means he stays in the game

8690.96 --> 8696.358999999999
haven't i ever watched the yogi bear

8693.359 --> 8696.359
cartoon

8698.56 --> 8704.279999999999
maybe a couple of times never been a big

8701.28 --> 8704.28
fan

8712.0 --> 8715.56
why do you ask

8733.76 --> 8738.64
ah yeah that's a good one the ball

8736.24 --> 8739.92
74 indeed

8738.64 --> 8742.64
don't throw out the baby with the

8739.92 --> 8746.0
bathwater you can learn from both things

8742.64 --> 8747.84
as or as nathan oakley likes to say it

8746.0 --> 8750.24
just swallow the meat and spit out the

8747.84 --> 8753.84
bones

8750.24 --> 8753.84
that's yeah

8757.2 --> 8762.08
um although eric dube might be a little

8759.359 --> 8765.800000000001
offended by that statement

8762.08 --> 8765.8
yeah that's his problem

8781.2 --> 8784.399000000001
is a doc what

8788.479 --> 8794.08
after steve oh my god

8791.2 --> 8796.800000000001
oh you mean eric dubai complained

8794.08 --> 8800.08
endlessly

8796.8 --> 8802.479
being mr complainy pants

8800.08 --> 8805.439
stealing

8802.479 --> 8808.24
no no actually own benjamin has promoted

8805.439 --> 8812.0
eric to base

8808.24 --> 8814.8
work and arguments didn't steal it

8812.0 --> 8817.12
but then as owen benjamin does

8814.8 --> 8818.56
he makes fun

8817.12 --> 8821.12
of the

8818.56 --> 8823.119999999999
bad sides that's what he does he makes

8821.12 --> 8824.800000000001
fun of people

8823.12 --> 8826.800000000001
right he

8824.8 --> 8829.599999999999
starts to highlight the silly things

8826.8 --> 8832.24
that stood out to him he he conjured

8829.6 --> 8835.439
forth the savage character

8832.24 --> 8838.319
which is kind of an expression of parts

8835.439 --> 8841.28
that are inside of eric dubay and by the

8838.319 --> 8843.039999999999
way a whole bunch of other people too

8841.28 --> 8845.12
they have safonier complex it's

8843.04 --> 8847.68
something that happens

8845.12 --> 8851.2
to people

8847.68 --> 8854.24
yeah he didn't steal his again this just

8851.2 --> 8859.12
this gamma language

8854.24 --> 8859.119999999999
he's still like how how did he steal

8859.2 --> 8862.2
this

8864.399 --> 8872.119999999999
it pisses me off when people echo that

8868.319 --> 8872.119999999999
like what's your evidence

8886.399 --> 8892.08
at what cost what is the cost then what

8889.04 --> 8894.399000000001
is the price that is paid

8892.08 --> 8897.6
like alex you get comparing to alex

8894.399 --> 8897.599999999999
jones are you nuts

8901.12 --> 8906.800000000001
i mean with alex jones you can very

8903.52 --> 8907.6
blatantly point at

8906.8 --> 8910.24
where

8907.6 --> 8912.479000000001
well the corruptions are despite his

8910.24 --> 8915.039999999999
supposed disclaimer that nobody buys

8912.479 --> 8916.72
anymore yeah where's where's the

8915.04 --> 8921.84
corruption points

8916.72 --> 8921.84
with owen benjamin obviously sarah says

8922.479 --> 8928.119999999999
where

8924.8 --> 8928.119999999999
name them

8934.96 --> 8940.599999999999
you name make the claim lay down the

8937.6 --> 8940.6
name

8967.359 --> 8971.359
oh

8969.359 --> 8973.92
okay

8971.359 --> 8976.640000000001
so you're not gonna name it

8973.92 --> 8979.28
instead you're gonna say

8976.64 --> 8980.64
i'm not good enough now because i'm not

8979.28 --> 8983.12
just

8980.64 --> 8983.92
taking what you said and making it my

8983.12 --> 8985.76
own

8983.92 --> 8988.24
no i had a rebuttal

8985.76 --> 8990.08
and an inquiry and you ignored it

8988.24 --> 8993.199999999999
but i guess i just have to watch eric

8990.08 --> 8994.96
dubay documentary and be oh

8993.2 --> 8998.800000000001
he is the best

8994.96 --> 9000.479
he is actually the king of flat earth

8998.8 --> 9003.479
no

9000.479 --> 9003.479
no

9005.52 --> 9009.76
and this smarter than the average bear

9008.0 --> 9012.24
you don't know how smart the average

9009.76 --> 9015.2
bear is and there's a lot of people also

9012.24 --> 9017.76
calling themselves bear out there

9015.2 --> 9020.08
that are not actually bears that are

9017.76 --> 9023.84
just fans of owen benjamin that doesn't

9020.08 --> 9023.84
has to be reciprocal

9040.0 --> 9043.76
the own benjamin's talked about that a

9042.72 --> 9047.358999999999
lot

9043.76 --> 9049.28
maybe if you just watch owen benjamin's

9047.359 --> 9052.16
streams

9049.28 --> 9053.84
that are daily in the weekdays

9052.16 --> 9056.24
then

9053.84 --> 9058.8
maybe you'd start to understand

9056.24 --> 9060.8
that he addressed all of that

9058.8 --> 9065.279999999999
everything he addresses things just like

9060.8 --> 9067.679999999998
i address things even when nobody asks

9065.28 --> 9070.560000000001
because when i feel something is wrong

9067.68 --> 9073.2
then i will be the one to point that out

9070.56 --> 9075.84
i don't need other people to point out

9073.2 --> 9078.319000000001
my sins and flaws

9075.84 --> 9081.04
because i know it better and i will put

9078.319 --> 9083.519999999999
it out and owen does that too

9081.04 --> 9087.52
he's done it very consistently you can

9083.52 --> 9088.640000000001
tell it's real you can't fake that

9087.52 --> 9090.560000000001
you can't

9088.64 --> 9093.039999999999
even if you're a good actor you can't

9090.56 --> 9094.88
fake what is real there's other info

9093.04 --> 9096.0
coming through with the spirit when that

9094.88 --> 9097.279999999999
happens

9096.0 --> 9099.28
and

9097.28 --> 9103.68
it affects

9099.28 --> 9107.16
how a person crystallizes

9103.68 --> 9107.16
in what they do

9121.76 --> 9126.960000000001
the cost is making any topic they touch

9125.68 --> 9129.359
being

9126.96 --> 9131.279999999999
the pla what the hell are you talking

9129.359 --> 9134.08
about

9131.28 --> 9136.319000000001
serious what the hell are you talking

9134.08 --> 9136.319
about

9136.96 --> 9142.24
i mean did you

9139.68 --> 9144.399
meet a couple of bears in the woods and

9142.24 --> 9147.28
they misbehaved and now you think that

9144.399 --> 9148.399
is owen benjamin

9147.28 --> 9151.2
what

9148.399 --> 9154.72
are these people that owen benjamin

9151.2 --> 9157.84
names on a regular basis

9154.72 --> 9160.319
does he know they exist you know anybody

9157.84 --> 9162.72
can call themselves there but if they

9160.319 --> 9164.8
don't actually behave according to the

9162.72 --> 9167.84
real bear code and they act like a bunch

9164.8 --> 9169.438999999998
of retards yeah that's guess what it's

9167.84 --> 9172.72
called trolls

9169.439 --> 9174.24
trolls there's people out there that are

9172.72 --> 9175.519999999999
possessed

9174.24 --> 9178.16
possessed

9175.52 --> 9182.16
to try and make him look shitty any way

9178.16 --> 9184.319
they can they really savagely hate what

9182.16 --> 9185.359
he does they really do

9184.319 --> 9188.479
like

9185.359 --> 9190.16
in ways worse than what i get at me

9188.479 --> 9192.96
worse

9190.16 --> 9195.039999999999
so yeah oh there's some people they have

9192.96 --> 9197.519999999999
bear in their name and they're behaving

9195.04 --> 9200.240000000002
like complete retards and making

9197.52 --> 9201.6
everything look and feel stupid oh could

9200.24 --> 9205.119999999999
it be that they're

9201.6 --> 9206.319
not actually bears ever considered that

9205.12 --> 9209.359
perhaps

9206.319 --> 9211.76
didn't that cross your mind you needed

9209.359 --> 9214.800000000001
it to be shitty because you don't want

9211.76 --> 9216.399
to like owen benjamin you want to think

9214.8 --> 9218.0
he is another shill

9216.399 --> 9220.88
that what you want

9218.0 --> 9220.88
why do you want that

9221.2 --> 9224.319000000001
why did you just let your critical

9222.8 --> 9226.56
thinking

9224.319 --> 9228.88
loose on the situation and figure out

9226.56 --> 9231.92
what's really happening instead of

9228.88 --> 9234.88
taking an easy

9231.92 --> 9238.04
quickly constructed impression through

9234.88 --> 9238.039999999999
it all

9251.76 --> 9255.64
what debate did he dodge

9262.96 --> 9268.56
how his globe arguments suck

9266.56 --> 9270.64
oh you mean he tried to defend the globe

9268.56 --> 9272.72
sort of for a while yeah that's because

9270.64 --> 9276.279999999999
he actually believed it

9272.72 --> 9276.279999999999
is it what

9284.16 --> 9288.479
it's big bear himself i don't like okay

9286.24 --> 9292.039999999999
well yeah then

9288.479 --> 9292.039999999999
that's your problem

9306.399 --> 9312.08
right i reference him a lot

9310.24 --> 9314.479
i like what he does i use him as

9312.08 --> 9316.56
inspiration sometimes i think

9314.479 --> 9320.88
he listens to me

9316.56 --> 9320.88
i have no evidence about that whatsoever

9323.6 --> 9327.92
i like him

9325.439 --> 9330.24
if you're gonna be stubbornly

9327.92 --> 9333.12
emphasizing how you disliking this is

9330.24 --> 9333.119999999999
not the place for you

9335.439 --> 9339.12
you understand

9337.04 --> 9342.319000000001
this is not the place for you then if

9339.12 --> 9344.399000000001
you insist on disliking him this is not

9342.319 --> 9346.399
the place for you

9344.399 --> 9347.84
because he will be brought up in a

9346.399 --> 9350.08
positive light

9347.84 --> 9353.08
in reflection to what i think about and

9350.08 --> 9353.08
say

9361.04 --> 9364.319000000001
with dubia in the beginning yeah

9363.28 --> 9367.12
sure

9364.319 --> 9369.519999999999
was experimental he was lit when he

9367.12 --> 9372.479000000001
faced dubai in the beginning

9369.52 --> 9374.16
he was a glober he didn't know any

9372.479 --> 9377.92
better

9374.16 --> 9379.68
it was like a serious shock to him and

9377.92 --> 9382.319
for somebody that's functioning on a

9379.68 --> 9383.84
pretty high level that has a lot of

9382.319 --> 9385.439
unexpected

9383.84 --> 9389.12
side effects

9385.439 --> 9390.16
it is a quite a shock when that happens

9389.12 --> 9392.08
all right

9390.16 --> 9394.84
actually awakening to flat earth

9392.08 --> 9397.92
sleepless nights sleepless months

9394.84 --> 9399.439
sometimes for most

9397.92 --> 9404.12
right

9399.439 --> 9404.12
that was a genuine shock

9413.12 --> 9417.12
to avoid yeah what would you do

9417.92 --> 9422.28
what the [ __ ] is the problem

9430.399 --> 9435.279999999999
no it's time to go get out of here

9433.6 --> 9436.720000000001
i warned you i warned you what would

9435.28 --> 9439.84
happen

9436.72 --> 9439.84
you need to get the [ __ ] out

9440.24 --> 9444.56
i'm not gonna hear that [ __ ] from you

9441.92 --> 9446.56
any longer i don't care what kind of

9444.56 --> 9448.64
input level you have

9446.56 --> 9453.359
if you're gonna talk like that then get

9448.64 --> 9455.76
the [ __ ] out of my hangout all right

9453.359 --> 9458.640000000001

else a failed actor who the [ __ ] are you

9458.64 --> 9463.199999999999
sock puppet

9460.88 --> 9464.8

9463.2 --> 9466.560000000001
record out there

9464.8 --> 9470.759999999998
who the [ __ ] are you to tell that

9466.56 --> 9470.76
somebody else is a failed actor

9473.34 --> 9476.45
[Music]

9482.64 --> 9486.16
this is savonia bate

9486.64 --> 9489.358999999999
terrible

9487.68 --> 9492.399
you are

9489.359 --> 9494.24
the eric dube follower that he was

9492.399 --> 9496.8
actually talking about you know when he

9494.24 --> 9499.6
did his old safari skit he wasn't

9496.8 --> 9501.599999999999
actually even referring to eric dubay he

9499.6 --> 9503.92
was referring to the people that

9501.6 --> 9506.319
followed him and were acting like

9503.92 --> 9509.439
special boys who knew the truth that

9506.319 --> 9513.68
nobody could handle yeah

9509.439 --> 9516.08
he was talking about you wasn't he

9513.68 --> 9520.92
obviously sarah says he was talking

9516.08 --> 9520.92
about you when he did those skits

9522.479 --> 9526.279999999999
yeah you're outta here

9526.89 --> 9530.09
[Music]

9538.88 --> 9544.56
i don't care what sarah is fleur for not

9541.52 --> 9547.12
flare if you don't talk [ __ ] like that

9544.56 --> 9547.119999999999
in here

9549.68 --> 9554.0
yeah oh ban flat earth there's no

9552.0 --> 9556.479
problem

9554.0 --> 9558.399
the flat earthers act like [ __ ] in my

9556.479 --> 9560.64
chat i ban him

9558.399 --> 9560.64
yeah

9561.04 --> 9565.12
if

9562.84 --> 9566.56
self-professed christians

9565.12 --> 9567.76
act

9566.56 --> 9568.72
like [ __ ]

9567.76 --> 9571.84
or

9568.72 --> 9575.039999999999
act extremely hypocritical in the face

9571.84 --> 9577.04
of their own self-declared belief right

9575.04 --> 9578.640000000001
i kick you

9577.04 --> 9581.2
you understand

9578.64 --> 9584.24
doesn't matter what your philosophical

9581.2 --> 9584.240000000002
convictions are

9586.8 --> 9590.679999999998
kick you just the same

9600.479 --> 9604.72
you're getting a timeout for that ask

9602.56 --> 9606.479
and receive

9604.72 --> 9607.358999999999
that is the dumbest thing i've ever

9606.479 --> 9610.24
heard

9607.359 --> 9613.720000000001
so that is the dumbest thing i've ever

9610.24 --> 9613.72
heard you say

9624.479 --> 9627.679999999998
ah

9625.359 --> 9629.92
right i'm gonna run out the show though

9627.68 --> 9629.92
man

9630.96 --> 9634.919999999998
over two and a half hours

9650.96 --> 9656.399
right so hey thanks everyone for coming

9654.08 --> 9658.399
i hope you like the show

9656.399 --> 9660.24
and if i band you then you probably

9658.399 --> 9662.8
don't like the show well guess what i

9660.24 --> 9665.279
don't give a [ __ ]

9662.8 --> 9667.759999999998
i have certain parameters here

9665.279 --> 9671.68
when i see somebody risking overstepping

9667.76 --> 9674.960000000001
that line i blatantly personally

9671.68 --> 9676.880000000001
warn them not to proceed

9674.96 --> 9679.039999999999
under consequence and then would you do

9676.88 --> 9681.92
it anyway yeah then you get banned and

9679.04 --> 9684.880000000001
you can stay the [ __ ] out

9681.92 --> 9687.359
all right that's how this works

9684.88 --> 9690.0
and there's plenty of people

9687.359 --> 9692.880000000001
that are quite counter opposite in their

9690.0 --> 9696.16
philosophical convictions as myself

9692.88 --> 9698.24
that know how to do that and they are

9696.16 --> 9700.399
allowed in here

9698.24 --> 9702.56
and they can even be a little smarmy or

9700.399 --> 9705.119999999999
something at times right

9702.56 --> 9707.278999999999
because they just know how to behave

9705.12 --> 9710.160000000002
like civil human beings

9707.279 --> 9710.16
with differences

9711.68 --> 9717.359
and be respectful about the differences

9714.72 --> 9718.399
right so anyway if you did like this

9717.359 --> 9720.720000000001
show

9718.399 --> 9721.599999999999
it's the longest show in a while by the

9720.72 --> 9723.438999999998
way

9721.6 --> 9725.52
if you did like it then please don't

9723.439 --> 9728.720000000001
forget that rogen's it up here here

9725.52 --> 9731.92
another owen benjamin legacy oh the

9728.72 --> 9733.679999999998
rogans the thumb the human son joe rogan

9731.92 --> 9735.6
the human thumb

9733.68 --> 9737.68
unit of measurement

9735.6 --> 9739.12
because he's so freaking small and that

9737.68 --> 9742.24
amuses

9739.12 --> 9745.2
owen benjamin to no end

9742.24 --> 9746.399
and yeah there's things wrong with with

9745.2 --> 9748.08
rogan

9746.399 --> 9750.88
that's why he does that he keeps kind of

9748.08 --> 9754.479
like poking him like that

9750.88 --> 9757.119999999999
right and i like it i i think it's funny

9754.479 --> 9758.96
i don't like to typically bully

9757.12 --> 9760.720000000001
rogans you know dude that guy could

9758.96 --> 9762.56
break my neck

9760.72 --> 9765.438999999998

9765.439 --> 9770.479000000001

9770.479 --> 9774.358999999999
it's kind of funny too

9775.359 --> 9780.319
and i think that he has also kind of

9777.76 --> 9783.2
been moving

9780.319 --> 9785.84
not worse neutral he's like staying in

9783.2 --> 9789.68
neutral grounds where it's tolerable

9785.84 --> 9791.76
doing some good things and some like me

9789.68 --> 9795.52
