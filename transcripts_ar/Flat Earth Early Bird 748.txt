5.98 --> 36.32
[Music]

41.48 --> 46.279999999999994
good morning

43.52 --> 48.800000000000004
welcome to flat earth early bird number

46.28 --> 50.399
748 i'm your host arwyn

48.8 --> 52.559
and before we start the show please

50.399 --> 53.44
don't forget to share it on any platform

52.559 --> 55.519999999999996
you deem fit

53.44 --> 57.44
and if you haven't already subscribe to

55.52 --> 59.6
my channel and hit the bell notification

57.44 --> 62.718999999999994
so you know when i'm going live which is

59.6 --> 64.559
normally 1 pm amsterdam time every day

62.719 --> 66.4
please also do support me through the

64.559 --> 68.32
paypal patreon super chat and the

66.4 --> 71.68
membership system join button

68.32 --> 74.72
they'll be much appreciated right

71.68 --> 77.28
so you can already see

74.72 --> 79.52
sun is out it's quite beautiful out

77.28 --> 79.52
there

79.92 --> 86.479
except for well the trails

83.439 --> 88.72
as you can clearly see but yeah

86.479 --> 92.079
all morning it's been very bright bright

88.72 --> 92.079
sun over there look at that

92.64 --> 97.36
it's really good to have some fresh

94.799 --> 97.36000000000001
sunlight

98.96 --> 101.83999999999999
it's quite beautiful

104.24 --> 109.36
but yeah it's probably gonna get a

105.84 --> 109.36
little grayish

109.68 --> 114.799
soon because they have been yeah leaving

112.56 --> 117.43900000000001
stuff behind up there

114.799 --> 118.88000000000001
it's already kind of a white soup over

117.439 --> 122.079
there so

118.88 --> 124.79899999999999
but yeah beautiful day

122.079 --> 126.96
good to have some sunlight basically

124.799 --> 129.84
woke up with sunlight shining in my eyes

126.96 --> 129.84
so

132.08 --> 138.64000000000001
all right yeah started 10 minutes

135.76 --> 140.319
late it was really weird because i

138.64 --> 141.35999999999999
thought i was gonna time this perfectly

140.319 --> 144.23899999999998
but

141.36 --> 145.20000000000002
yeah that didn't work out because i got

144.239 --> 148.4
up in time

145.2 --> 149.83999999999997
and yeah it took all took a little

148.4 --> 157.59900000000002
longer than i thought

149.84 --> 170.64000000000001
anyway i got some coffee with me

157.599 --> 173.81
and green tea

170.64 --> 173.80999999999997
[Music]

173.92 --> 182.319
so nobody in chat just yet

177.28 --> 185.2
it's wednesday 16th of december 2020.

182.319 --> 187.92
ah there's already eight watching nobody

185.2 --> 187.92
commenting yet

194.64 --> 200.72
see should be

198.4 --> 203.59900000000002
some people out there oh well i'll just

200.72 --> 203.599
start without you

207.04 --> 214.64
let's see yeah yesterday was interesting

211.12 --> 215.44
it's pretty busy ah here we go against

214.64 --> 220.0
first

215.44 --> 220.0
m yeah good to see you

220.319 --> 225.67999999999998
i noticed you were live on skype i was

223.519 --> 229.28
hoping you would get there

225.68 --> 231.76000000000002
right so yesterday i don't know i felt

229.28 --> 234.319
that the show was kind of slow

231.76 --> 236.72
but i did have a couple of good moments

234.319 --> 236.72
i just

237.12 --> 240.239
it's weird how that works when i feel

239.28 --> 242.0
slow

240.239 --> 243.92000000000002
i do have good moments rolling out but

242.0 --> 245.439
it's like they don't really stick to my

243.92 --> 248.72
memory too much

245.439 --> 250.56
it's weird how that works so like after

248.72 --> 251.519
the show if i felt like that then i

250.56 --> 253.68
don't really

251.519 --> 256.0
remember the good moments as much in

253.68 --> 258.639
contrast to when i feel much more

256.0 --> 261.04
energized i might still have slow

258.639 --> 262.88
moments in there it's just that

261.04 --> 267.36
my memory sticks more to the better

262.88 --> 267.36
moments that's a realization i had

267.44 --> 270.8
it's it's weird how that works out every

269.52 --> 272.639
time

270.8 --> 275.04
but yeah yesterday still got plenty of

272.639 --> 276.88
compliments

275.04 --> 278.96000000000004
i had some good moments but i didn't

276.88 --> 280.479
watch it back though

278.96 --> 283.19899999999996
all right the flat earth debate was also

280.479 --> 286.639
pretty good

283.199 --> 286.639
people were a bit rumpussy

287.36 --> 291.36
didn't miss most of the after show

289.52 --> 293.52
unfortunately

291.36 --> 294.40000000000003
because i went out for groceries i

293.52 --> 296.4
didn't want to

294.4 --> 298.56
go out for groceries in the dark because

296.4 --> 302.15999999999997
that's kind of annoying

298.56 --> 304.56
uh owen benjamin was also alive

302.16 --> 307.84000000000003
some good stuff got into a bit of a sort

304.56 --> 307.84
of an argument it's weird

308.96 --> 313.039
because i said something and he

310.639 --> 316.639
disagreed because he was bringing up

313.039 --> 317.039
germ theory and terrain theory and yeah

316.639 --> 318.88
it's

317.039 --> 321.36
it's interesting because that was that

318.88 --> 324.4
subject was also brought up

321.36 --> 325.6
not too long ago was it in ball busters

324.4 --> 326.96
or was it during the flight earth

325.6 --> 328.88
debates i didn't remember i think it was

326.96 --> 332.4
during the flat earth debates

328.88 --> 334.24
with kiwi and nathan

332.4 --> 336.71999999999997
actually like yeah now there is

334.24 --> 340.08
scientific support for germ theory

336.72 --> 340.72
it's just the existential conclusions

340.08 --> 343.199
drawn

340.72 --> 345.199
there from that are kind of in dubious

343.199 --> 349.6
territory

345.199 --> 351.759
and terrain theory is very viable

349.6 --> 353.759
but in my opinion when i just thought

351.759 --> 356.08000000000004
about it

353.759 --> 357.44
it seems like germ theory and terrain

356.08 --> 361.35999999999996
theory

357.44 --> 367.12
like yeah they work together

361.36 --> 369.36
like they they match

367.12 --> 370.319
and then there's of course the virus

369.36 --> 373.44
theory which

370.319 --> 377.36
is yeah which lies in the nonsense

373.44 --> 379.84
area of the conclusions

377.36 --> 381.12
right there's no real scientific proof

379.84 --> 384.88
to back it up

381.12 --> 387.039
not really it's

384.88 --> 388.08
yeah let's just compare the types of

387.039 --> 391.199
evidence

388.08 --> 392.84
when with germ theory there was a vast

391.199 --> 396.16
amount of

392.84 --> 398.15999999999997
experimentation to actually back it up

396.16 --> 401.44
there's just all this experimentation

398.16 --> 403.44
data about it

401.44 --> 404.88
right but terrain theory it does matter

403.44 --> 407.039
a lot because terrain theory is

404.88 --> 409.919
everything about the conditions

407.039 --> 411.28
and i always bring this in but the

409.919 --> 415.12
conditions

411.28 --> 417.52
simply they're like this

415.12 --> 419.28000000000003
like it's part of a switchboard of the

417.52 --> 422.15999999999997
scenario and the scenario are the

419.28 --> 424.79999999999995
bacteria so if the terrain

422.16 --> 427.91900000000004
is very good for your body it's like a

424.8 --> 431.44
healthy condition then yeah the bacteria

427.919 --> 434.4
they just don't get out of control

431.44 --> 435.44
or they're dealt with easily they don't

434.4 --> 438.0
get in

435.44 --> 439.12
if the conditions of the environment are

438.0 --> 442.0
bad

439.12 --> 443.84000000000003
it also falls in terrain theory then the

442.0 --> 446.96
germs suddenly

443.84 --> 450.08
yeah start to break free start to do

446.96 --> 452.79999999999995
that thing see and so i figured out like

450.08 --> 455.039
yeah no they worked together perfectly

452.8 --> 456.24
but big bear didn't agree with me and

455.039 --> 458.08
then when i

456.24 --> 459.759
basically tried to put that forward i

458.08 --> 461.919
got timed out by somebody i don't know

459.759 --> 465.199
who doesn't really matter

461.919 --> 468.56
it's yeah it's not like the

465.199 --> 470.319
a debate i don't think that owen really

468.56 --> 471.039
likes doing that anyway but he took this

470.319 --> 473.759
position

471.039 --> 475.039
and yeah i realized no i disagree with

473.759 --> 478.0
that position

475.039 --> 479.039
and i can back that up so that's why i

478.0 --> 480.8
made a note of it

479.039 --> 483.599
now i'm bringing it up here i wasn't

480.8 --> 486.879
sure if i should call the entire hangout

483.599 --> 489.44
that was just a small little yeah

486.879 --> 490.24
puzzle piece and it just seems like wait

489.44 --> 492.8
no this

490.24 --> 493.28000000000003
actually fits perfectly why this is not

492.8 --> 496.40000000000003
up

493.28 --> 498.87899999999996
in opposition to one another it works

496.4 --> 498.87899999999996
together

501.36 --> 505.68
yeah and it gets much weirder when you

503.759 --> 506.639
bring in the german new medicine that

505.68 --> 511.199
completely

506.639 --> 514.159
nega yeah discards the notion

511.199 --> 514.159
of germ theory

514.32 --> 521.12
and still works out but

518.24 --> 522.64
what about the scientific experimental

521.12 --> 525.92
data

522.64 --> 529.1999999999999
concerning germ theory does that make

525.92 --> 532.399
just a model that just doesn't utilize

529.2 --> 534.2
any of that that still works out negate

532.399 --> 536.64
the scientific evidence of the

534.2 --> 540.24
experimentation

536.64 --> 542.72
no no it doesn't yeah

540.24 --> 544.88
that's when science gets a little

542.72 --> 548.1600000000001
confusing now doesn't it

544.88 --> 551.2
seemingly contrasting well

548.16 --> 555.36
maybe they just both

551.2 --> 558.88
work and

555.36 --> 561.04
they both give a different backdrop

558.88 --> 564.399
for the consciousness and the spirit to

561.04 --> 567.1999999999999
approach reality

564.399 --> 567.519
ever consider that yeah now it's almost

567.2 --> 571.839
like

567.519 --> 574.16
magic yeah that's how i see reality

571.839 --> 575.2790000000001
a lot of the times because of these

574.16 --> 578.399
types of

575.279 --> 580.0
things that you find it's like why why

578.399 --> 583.6
if both things

580.0 --> 584.24
work and seem to completely ignore one

583.6 --> 585.9200000000001
another

584.24 --> 587.44
how can both things work at the same

585.92 --> 588.3199999999999
time well maybe it has to do with the

587.44 --> 589.6800000000001
focus

588.32 --> 592.08
maybe it has to do with the train of

589.68 --> 596.4799999999999
thought and

592.08 --> 599.519
the experience of the experimenter

596.48 --> 599.519
and the participants

600.56 --> 604.88
that it is like the way of thinking

602.959 --> 607.3599999999999
provides another

604.88 --> 609.12
structure that just allows these things

607.36 --> 612.32
to work like this

609.12 --> 615.44
like it gives another backdrop feel

612.32 --> 615.44
almost to nature

615.519 --> 622.0
yeah how about that

618.64 --> 624.24
how about that for a realization

622.0 --> 626.399
and it fixes some issues with me because

624.24 --> 629.519
i have

626.399 --> 632.8
like germany medicine like i've

629.519 --> 635.68
basically been testing it in my own way

632.8 --> 636.56
and it was mostly about just letting go

635.68 --> 640.0
letting go

636.56 --> 643.1999999999999
of like but i have to keep track of this

640.0 --> 644.0
like out of fear i have to think i

643.2 --> 647.279
always

644.0 --> 649.36
like never forget the germ theory

647.279 --> 651.519
knowledge because it's dangerous like

649.36 --> 654.88
that right

651.519 --> 657.68
but i did that and i trusted that

654.88 --> 659.68
and i still do it because i've basically

657.68 --> 663.12
decided not to go back and fear

659.68 --> 664.3199999999999
germs ever again why because of some

663.12 --> 667.04
lessons i learned that

664.32 --> 668.88
is that morality has a massive influence

667.04 --> 673.279
on your condition

668.88 --> 676.48
and with great strength and trust

673.279 --> 678.8
say trusting god trust in yourself

676.48 --> 680.32
yeah you can actually handle these

678.8 --> 682.16
things much better

680.32 --> 684.6400000000001
your body just works better responds

682.16 --> 686.3199999999999
better if you might get some kind of

684.64 --> 689.519
illness response is a last

686.32 --> 695.12
shorter so that's why

689.519 --> 695.12
i decided to ignore the germ theory

695.2 --> 698.6400000000001
philosophical consequences

697.399 --> 701.92
extrapolations

698.64 --> 703.1999999999999
the philosophy that naturally flows from

701.92 --> 705.36
it

703.2 --> 706.9590000000001
even though i do recognize that

705.36 --> 709.6800000000001
scientifically

706.959 --> 712.079
it's grounded in truth in scientific

709.68 --> 717.519
method based data

712.079 --> 720.88
yeah that's weird isn't it

717.519 --> 724.72
so i know it is real

720.88 --> 727.76
but i just recognized that there isn't

724.72 --> 730.32
there is a mysterious element to it i

727.76 --> 732.959
presume or i presuppose it has to do

730.32 --> 736.639
with the consciousness itself

732.959 --> 736.6389999999999
and the structure of approach

737.6 --> 741.44
right i'm not claiming science of this

739.839 --> 745.6
by the way this is just

741.44 --> 747.519
trying me trying to figure it out

745.6 --> 749.44
and just realizing like just because

747.519 --> 751.839
something is grounded in truth doesn't

749.44 --> 751.839
make the

753.36 --> 758.72
the trains of thinking and

756.48 --> 760.48
view on things that flow there from

758.72 --> 763.12
naturally or that are

760.48 --> 764.0
unnaturally dragged in there by other

763.12 --> 765.92
people

764.0 --> 768.639
that just happened to come with it that

765.92 --> 773.76
it have done all the talking

768.639 --> 777.92
to give it a cultural specif specificity

773.76 --> 779.39
right it's just like atheism

777.92 --> 781.92
like atheism

779.39 --> 785.92
[Music]

781.92 --> 788.399
has had all these people in media

785.92 --> 790.88
handing out the ideas

788.399 --> 792.959
and the philosophies that come in with

790.88 --> 796.079
it the ways of thinking

792.959 --> 796.6389999999999
now does that make atheism just just

796.079 --> 798.56
that

796.639 --> 800.24
just these people just these ways of

798.56 --> 802.0
thinking well we started to

800.24 --> 805.519
automatically associate

802.0 --> 806.079
it with that i have and i even when i

805.519 --> 809.6
was

806.079 --> 812.8
atheist typically did that tried to

809.6 --> 813.44
figure it like make try to make the most

812.8 --> 816.3199999999999
sense

813.44 --> 818.24
and that seemed to be echoing these

816.32 --> 821.0400000000001
smart people

818.24 --> 823.839
so i just started to kind of like try to

821.04 --> 823.8389999999999
talk like that

823.92 --> 829.519
but i didn't know i didn't it was just

826.959 --> 834.8
trying to follow my intuition with that

829.519 --> 834.8
didn't really know it's weird

835.36 --> 842.16
anyway yeah

838.48 --> 845.76
i think i broke up my train of thought

842.16 --> 848.959
but yeah the way the consequence

845.76 --> 850.72
like this spiritual and spiritual

848.959 --> 853.76
consequences

850.72 --> 858.8000000000001
of realizing certain things

853.76 --> 862.56
certain ways of thinking certain themes

858.8 --> 864.8
that's not a theme certain areas

862.56 --> 866.959
of knowledge and the scientific method

864.8 --> 869.279
and all that if it is involved

866.959 --> 870.88
or if it is not involved it's still

869.279 --> 873.6
extremely important

870.88 --> 875.279
but it will yield some weird results in

873.6 --> 877.6
certain areas

875.279 --> 879.4399999999999
because some things that seem to just

877.6 --> 882.72
conflict

879.44 --> 885.839
will both be scientifically valid

882.72 --> 888.32
how do you deal with that well i

885.839 --> 889.6
am talking about how to deal with that

888.32 --> 892.639
it's very difficult

889.6 --> 893.519
it's like yet another compression of it

892.639 --> 896.72
all

893.519 --> 898.399
oh god there is another like it turns

896.72 --> 901.36
out it's not one fluid

898.399 --> 904.88
big pan of data no it's actually like a

901.36 --> 904.88
multi-faced crystal

904.959 --> 911.1199999999999
of fragments of data

908.079 --> 914.7199999999999
so things can be true even though they

911.12 --> 918.399
don't seem to match yeah yeah

914.72 --> 918.399
reality is a little complicated

920.0 --> 924.8
anyway see more people at chat michael

922.639 --> 928.16
jones

924.8 --> 928.16
brand m good to see you

929.12 --> 933.279
yeah guys what do you think can you

932.48 --> 941.49
follow

933.279 --> 944.59
or is it a little early for you

941.49 --> 944.59
[Music]

952.839 --> 955.839
right

966.839 --> 969.839
eh

973.92 --> 977.759
i think i follow and it's a little early

975.839 --> 980.9590000000001
okay okay

977.759 --> 984.88
it's just it's just

980.959 --> 987.3599999999999
me breaking new ground again it's

984.88 --> 988.72
it feels like that it's it happens every

987.36 --> 991.44
freaking time people

988.72 --> 992.5600000000001
because i can't i just can't let it go i

991.44 --> 996.24
can let

992.56 --> 997.04
not let anything go when it's this big

996.24 --> 999.12
i'd like

997.04 --> 1000.88
i just keep hanging on until i just

999.12 --> 1004.5600000000001
start to see

1000.88 --> 1008.0
this is service rainfall sometimes

1004.56 --> 1011.4399999999999
but this i've gotten so used to just

1008.0 --> 1014.079
doing that non-stop like a computer

1011.44 --> 1014.9590000000001
that's doing these high processes always

1014.079 --> 1017.3599999999999
always

1014.959 --> 1019.1199999999999
even when i sleep it's just something

1017.36 --> 1021.04
that's always happening

1019.12 --> 1023.12
and then eventually you get used to it

1021.04 --> 1025.6
and like everything just sets up in the

1023.12 --> 1028.48
way that it can always keep on running

1025.6 --> 1029.52
without straining so much like the

1028.48 --> 1032.559
engine

1029.52 --> 1035.9189999999999
becomes reshaped

1032.559 --> 1036.319
rebuilt in a way that because it knows

1035.919 --> 1037.919
it

1036.319 --> 1039.9189999999999
always has to keep running and then

1037.919 --> 1043.1200000000001
everything adapts to that

1039.919 --> 1046.0
and things start to run more efficient

1043.12 --> 1048.4799999999998
yeah sounds a little vague but that's

1046.0 --> 1052.16
the way i describe it

1048.48 --> 1054.48
it's very useful also makes me

1052.16 --> 1055.28
it also railroads the way i am by the

1054.48 --> 1057.52
way

1055.28 --> 1058.559
but yeah that's become kind of obvious

1057.52 --> 1060.16
uh

1058.559 --> 1062.8799999999999
anyway yeah that was a pretty

1060.16 --> 1066.24
interesting on benjamin

1062.88 --> 1069.2800000000002
and then i noticed oh wait kiwi live i

1066.24 --> 1072.72
completely forgot it was actually live

1069.28 --> 1074.72
so i got in there kind of halfway

1072.72 --> 1076.4
and it was good it was interesting i got

1074.72 --> 1078.84
a few

1076.4 --> 1081.8400000000001
quick points again about the scientific

1078.84 --> 1081.84
method

1085.36 --> 1090.6399999999999
and i don't know i think it's it would

1088.32 --> 1091.36
be interesting if i could sort of have a

1090.64 --> 1096.72
discussion

1091.36 --> 1096.7199999999998
on the high level about this conundrum

1098.64 --> 1102.0
like when things seemingly contrast or

1101.12 --> 1105.12
completely

1102.0 --> 1105.44
negate one another but both are grounded

1105.12 --> 1109.84
in

1105.44 --> 1109.8400000000001
scientific valid proof

1109.919 --> 1113.5200000000002
then how do you match it well i've

1112.48 --> 1116.48
attempted it

1113.52 --> 1119.36
a donna rothing by basically saying look

1116.48 --> 1123.1200000000001
germ theory and terrain theory are

1119.36 --> 1126.7199999999998
should be united

1123.12 --> 1130.32
to make it from 2d

1126.72 --> 1132.559
into 3d both are a direct influence

1130.32 --> 1134.6399999999999
terrain theory directly influences the

1132.559 --> 1136.32
way germ theory

1134.64 --> 1140.0
envelops because the germ theory

1136.32 --> 1140.0
basically shows the process

1140.08 --> 1145.52
and the terrain theory emphasizes the

1143.039 --> 1150.48
conditions

1145.52 --> 1153.76
right and that's basically

1150.48 --> 1154.96
my suggestion on how to continue the

1153.76 --> 1158.4
development

1154.96 --> 1161.039
concerning both

1158.4 --> 1161.919
right but kiwi went live anyway and got

1161.039 --> 1166.799
on there and

1161.919 --> 1166.7990000000002
scientific method laid down

1167.44 --> 1172.72
my own understanding of it

1170.64 --> 1175.44
and that i'm still having difficulties

1172.72 --> 1178.799
with actually applying the method

1175.44 --> 1180.48
still need help with that and it's also

1178.799 --> 1182.799
it's always good when you do something

1180.48 --> 1183.679
that serious to have people to reflect

1182.799 --> 1186.799
upon

1183.679 --> 1189.8400000000001
to help you out because it's

1186.799 --> 1192.559
it's not that easy it really isn't

1189.84 --> 1194.08
like to really get all the the

1192.559 --> 1198.72
requirements of

1194.08 --> 1201.039
what a phenomenon is and what

1198.72 --> 1202.0
really is the very and manipulating of

1201.039 --> 1205.44
the phenomena

1202.0 --> 1208.799
like it's so specific to

1205.44 --> 1211.679
to like a lower level of

1208.799 --> 1212.4
of physical reality it's really you have

1211.679 --> 1215.919
to be so

1212.4 --> 1219.6000000000001
unbelievably precise and really get it

1215.919 --> 1222.4
it's very fine work it's just difficult

1219.6 --> 1222.7199999999998
but actually understanding what it is

1222.4 --> 1225.2
and

1222.72 --> 1228.08
why it has to be this specific and the

1225.2 --> 1228.0800000000002
conclusions

1228.64 --> 1234.4
yeah that's very interesting and

1232.0 --> 1235.28
i've been thinking a lot about it and

1234.4 --> 1238.4
they're from

1235.28 --> 1238.3999999999999
also spring this

1238.64 --> 1245.76
germ theory and terrain theory should be

1242.08 --> 1249.84
hand-in-hand should be united married

1245.76 --> 1249.84
you could say

1252.0 --> 1264.64
hey bit of venom

1262.32 --> 1266.96
right yeah brandon must be very early

1264.64 --> 1266.96
for you

1267.2 --> 1270.32
right so i've been watching more babylon

1269.919 --> 1272.5590000000002
5

1270.32 --> 1272.559
2.

1274.0 --> 1277.28
like i really forgot how heavy that

1276.08 --> 1279.28
stuff is

1277.28 --> 1281.76
and it's funny also because i'm noticing

1279.28 --> 1285.12
more now that it is almost like a

1281.76 --> 1288.799
it's such a quick paced little drama

1285.12 --> 1290.1589999999999
like this is yeah

1288.799 --> 1292.24
sounds a little demeaning don't mean it

1290.159 --> 1294.0
like it but it's like the world

1292.24 --> 1295.76
turns like everybody's heard of that

1294.0 --> 1298.24
it's really stupid

1295.76 --> 1299.28
in many ways but it's like it is much

1298.24 --> 1302.32
slower

1299.28 --> 1303.28
but it's always it's formulaic and

1302.32 --> 1307.12
always

1303.28 --> 1309.039
co it makes feelings it just

1307.12 --> 1311.12
gives this framework of like this is

1309.039 --> 1313.2
happening this is the sensation and then

1311.12 --> 1315.6789999999999
you get the impression

1313.2 --> 1316.4
that there's real personal development

1315.679 --> 1319.679
going on

1316.4 --> 1322.799
well babylon 5 did this

1319.679 --> 1325.8400000000001
to a very refined level but you can

1322.799 --> 1329.52
still see it especially in the beginning

1325.84 --> 1332.6399999999999
that that is kind of it's like this

1329.52 --> 1336.24
soap opera in space

1332.64 --> 1339.3600000000001
with a very well refined developed world

1336.24 --> 1340.799
like real cultural development like

1339.36 --> 1341.6
different cultures of the different

1340.799 --> 1344.559
aliens and

1341.6 --> 1345.76
it is very profound one of the most

1344.559 --> 1349.36
detailed

1345.76 --> 1351.84
cultural scenarios put on film that i've

1349.36 --> 1351.84
ever seen

1351.919 --> 1358.159
this is like really big history

1355.2 --> 1360.48
and culture and like how do they think

1358.159 --> 1363.679
how do they really think it's all very

1360.48 --> 1366.4
well thought out like the person that

1363.679 --> 1368.64
that wrote that must have done very

1366.4 --> 1370.4
extensive cultural studies

1368.64 --> 1372.64
in different cultures and ways of

1370.4 --> 1376.24
thinking it has to

1372.64 --> 1377.039
you can just see it but it is kind of

1376.24 --> 1379.28
like

1377.039 --> 1381.44
put together like a soap opera it's

1379.28 --> 1383.36
really funny to realize that and

1381.44 --> 1385.8400000000001
kind of like the quality of the music

1383.36 --> 1387.6
which is yeah i've become very spoiled

1385.84 --> 1390.3999999999999
with music

1387.6 --> 1391.4399999999998
so it's like okay it's all right but it

1390.4 --> 1394.96
is kind of like

1391.44 --> 1397.3600000000001
a little cheapy sound effects

1394.96 --> 1399.3600000000001
and that really plays into the soap

1397.36 --> 1400.9599999999998
opera thing because that is very typical

1399.36 --> 1404.08
for sofa for us

1400.96 --> 1404.799
that they had like cheap ass music so

1404.08 --> 1408.24
it's just so

1404.799 --> 1411.76
funny what this series is doing to me

1408.24 --> 1413.6
watching it again but also damn it's so

1411.76 --> 1417.52
freaking intense also it's so

1413.6 --> 1421.4399999999998
quick paced and like sometimes very

1417.52 --> 1423.9189999999999
very serious and very quick

1421.44 --> 1425.6000000000001
to heartbreak but still well done and

1423.919 --> 1429.5200000000002
all that it's

1425.6 --> 1433.039
it's never like

1429.52 --> 1435.039
like unwanted cheesy or something like

1433.039 --> 1437.679
they have places for fun

1435.039 --> 1439.44
but they really also found a careful

1437.679 --> 1441.52
timing for these things so it's very

1439.44 --> 1445.44
smooth

1441.52 --> 1446.8799999999999
smoother than i remembered but also just

1445.44 --> 1449.44
the formula of how it

1446.88 --> 1449.44
unrolls

1450.159 --> 1453.279
like even knowing what's gonna happen

1452.4 --> 1455.52
it's still

1453.279 --> 1459.84
interesting to watch it again that's

1455.52 --> 1462.8799999999999
something i didn't expect so much

1459.84 --> 1463.36
right yeah you're addicted now it's

1462.88 --> 1466.88
funny

1463.36 --> 1469.12
and profound i i yes but be careful

1466.88 --> 1472.24
though

1469.12 --> 1474.3999999999999
yeah don't just don't keep drowning in

1472.24 --> 1474.4
it

1474.64 --> 1482.0800000000002
like if you if you really get obsessed

1478.24 --> 1484.64
it can mess you up and like

1482.08 --> 1487.6789999999999
it's very obvious that there is like a

1484.64 --> 1489.44
lot of occult words used

1487.679 --> 1490.72
in the sense that yeah it's freaking

1489.44 --> 1494.64
babylon and they also

1490.72 --> 1499.44
reference that

1494.64 --> 1502.7990000000002
like it's the story is like paralleling

1499.44 --> 1506.3200000000002
trying to parallel the babylon

1502.799 --> 1506.32
history in a way

1507.2 --> 1513.52
and yet you got to be careful with that

1510.799 --> 1514.0
so see it's it's a complicated dance

1513.52 --> 1516.96
it's a

1514.0 --> 1519.44
really complicated thing the whole

1516.96 --> 1519.44
series

1522.159 --> 1526.96
all right anyway i'm glad you're

1523.52 --> 1530.1589999999999
enjoying it don't drown too much into it

1526.96 --> 1533.52
careful not to watch it all in one week

1530.159 --> 1535.679
or something i myself try to

1533.52 --> 1538.24
exchange it a little with south park

1535.679 --> 1541.3600000000001
south park is also just

1538.24 --> 1545.919
super impressive like

1541.36 --> 1547.84
it's actually matured very well

1545.919 --> 1549.3600000000001
the early seasons i'm watching i've

1547.84 --> 1553.4399999999998
watched season three

1549.36 --> 1556.8799999999999
and four into four and just like

1553.44 --> 1560.0
man is that like hitting the spot

1556.88 --> 1561.8400000000001
right now like even more than

1560.0 --> 1563.279
when it kind of during the time when it

1561.84 --> 1567.039
came out

1563.279 --> 1570.799
when it seemed like whoa dude

1567.039 --> 1574.24
that is like hardcore and now it's like

1570.799 --> 1578.6399999999999
damn damn were they on target

1574.24 --> 1581.1200000000001
it's really refined like the psychology

1578.64 --> 1584.64
of south park

1581.12 --> 1587.9189999999999
is more refined and spiritually

1584.64 --> 1588.64
in touch with reality then they try to

1587.919 --> 1591.1200000000001
let on

1588.64 --> 1594.88
with the joking around and that's

1591.12 --> 1594.8799999999999
something i've really started to notice

1597.44 --> 1602.3500000000001
anyway that's it for my notes it only

1600.08 --> 1605.53
took me a half an hour

1602.35 --> 1605.53
[Music]

1609.279 --> 1614.799
oh yeah here we go again

1612.559 --> 1618.08
can i give you kind of a creepy spoiler

1614.799 --> 1621.52
for when it's already kind of done

1618.08 --> 1624.96
but yeah you might have also downloaded

1621.52 --> 1626.72
a follow-up series right

1624.96 --> 1628.0
what's it called again i don't know

1626.72 --> 1629.919
what's it called it

1628.0 --> 1631.919
but they emphasize like this is the

1629.919 --> 1637.5200000000002
continuing series only one or

1631.919 --> 1637.5200000000002
was it two seasons guess what happens

1638.08 --> 1641.279
the earth is quarantined because there's

1639.919 --> 1644.3990000000001
a virus

1641.279 --> 1646.88
uh yeah

1644.399 --> 1649.279
that's like a big slap in the face to

1646.88 --> 1652.3200000000002
remember that

1649.279 --> 1655.84
yes but that's don't worry

1652.32 --> 1655.84
there's nothing yeah

1656.0 --> 1661.2
you still have like four yeah three

1659.679 --> 1663.279
seasons

1661.2 --> 1664.799
and a whole lot of movies to go through

1663.279 --> 1668.159
before that

1664.799 --> 1670.399
so but that like really afterwards is

1668.159 --> 1670.3990000000001
like

1674.0 --> 1678.64
oh yeah yeah hey don't spoil it for

1676.24 --> 1682.08
other people okay

1678.64 --> 1685.2
but i know it's it's

1682.08 --> 1685.1999999999998
very captivating

1688.399 --> 1693.6
gets very exciting and it doesn't stop

1690.96 --> 1693.6000000000001
okay like

1693.679 --> 1696.799
it only really kind of starts to slow

1695.679 --> 1698.88
down a little

1696.799 --> 1702.559
in season five it just keeps on going

1698.88 --> 1706.72
and going going it's very intense

1702.559 --> 1710.24
right uh

1706.72 --> 1713.679
hey voynich did you see

1710.24 --> 1716.88
uh i saw the version with the

1713.679 --> 1718.799
big black box

1716.88 --> 1721.6000000000001
they never released the original in the

1718.799 --> 1721.6
netherlands i think

1722.64 --> 1725.039
for any

1726.74 --> 1730.289
[Music]

1733.76 --> 1737.279
the original was on tv

1737.44 --> 1741.039
i don't know might have seen it i don't

1739.84 --> 1744.8799999999999
know

1741.039 --> 1748.559
but it was literally just

1744.88 --> 1752.3990000000001
if i've seen it then it was just a guy

1748.559 --> 1755.2
it was just just the guy

1752.399 --> 1756.32
if i remember correctly and i did see

1755.2 --> 1759.76
the live one

1756.32 --> 1759.76
for two days or whatever

1759.919 --> 1765.1200000000001
but look it wasn't even it was just

1763.039 --> 1767.84
about

1765.12 --> 1768.799
the sacred cow thing and that's what

1767.84 --> 1770.8799999999999
south park

1768.799 --> 1772.72
kind of like has been championing for a

1770.88 --> 1777.679
time

1772.72 --> 1777.679
oh and benjamin is taking up the banner

1778.0 --> 1783.36
higher than before in ways south park

1781.52 --> 1787.279
has been kind of like

1783.36 --> 1790.799
slowing it down a little become more

1787.279 --> 1790.799
theme based

1793.36 --> 1797.039
but yeah it's a long time ago

1801.84 --> 1811.76
right anyway

1809.279 --> 1814.03
so anything special i should be notified

1811.76 --> 1817.17
about

1814.03 --> 1817.17
[Music]

1817.919 --> 1823.8400000000001
anything you guys and girls want me to

1820.64 --> 1823.8400000000001
talk about

1834.84 --> 1837.84
man

1870.24 --> 1872.559
um

1875.12 --> 1878.32
you're all about b5 right now yeah i get

1877.2 --> 1879.8400000000001
that

1878.32 --> 1881.6789999999999
but yeah i'm not gonna talk about

1879.84 --> 1883.8
babylon 5 just

1881.679 --> 1885.8400000000001
the entire show

1883.8 --> 1892.399
[Music]

1885.84 --> 1894.9599999999998
already talked about it a little

1892.399 --> 1897.9189999999999
but yeah i'm not that much into it like

1894.96 --> 1901.919
i'd like to focus to reality a little

1897.919 --> 1907.8400000000001
but it's good to to read it again

1901.919 --> 1907.8400000000001
because it is like a novel

1917.84 --> 1921.4399999999998
i don't mind that it's all nonsense i'm

1920.88 --> 1925.44
not even

1921.44 --> 1927.1200000000001
yet thinking a lot about what to do with

1925.44 --> 1930.559
these squirters that are

1927.12 --> 1933.4399999999998
just trying to screw around with me

1930.559 --> 1935.84
and whatever reason that they are able

1933.44 --> 1935.8400000000001
to do that

1936.88 --> 1943.919
and i think that i'm gonna just

1940.159 --> 1943.919
completely start to ignore it

1946.84 --> 1952.799
because i don't know i

1949.6 --> 1953.12
i just don't want to give them any sort

1952.799 --> 1955.679
of

1953.12 --> 1957.9189999999999
form of satisfaction for their actions

1955.679 --> 1963.519
anymore

1957.919 --> 1966.48
because yeah they they just need to

1963.519 --> 1970.08
go away start to find something more

1966.48 --> 1973.1200000000001
productive to do and this is not it

1970.08 --> 1977.279
these things that they're doing is just

1973.12 --> 1980.8799999999999
anything but productive

1977.279 --> 1984.32
and i just don't want to give them any

1980.88 --> 1987.8400000000001
form of satisfaction anymore

1984.32 --> 1987.84
but yeah it's going to be a little tough

1988.84 --> 1993.76
though

1991.519 --> 1994.96
because i'm just used to being openly

1993.76 --> 1999.2
defensive

1994.96 --> 2001.679
in a way to make a statement like yes

1999.2 --> 2002.48
i know what you are this is how i feel

2001.679 --> 2004.5590000000002
just to

2002.48 --> 2006.159
help remind people what it's like to

2004.559 --> 2009.76
actually be a real person

2006.159 --> 2009.7600000000002
in a way but

2010.24 --> 2018.0
yeah for some reason they

2015.44 --> 2019.919
they try to swarm me with that because

2018.0 --> 2022.08
of that

2019.919 --> 2023.679
it's just too bright i never dim the

2022.08 --> 2026.72
light

2023.679 --> 2026.72
and it burns them

2028.0 --> 2031.519
now i wish i wouldn't find so much

2030.399 --> 2035.6
satisfaction

2031.519 --> 2037.1200000000001
in that insight to realize that they are

2035.6 --> 2039.1999999999998
basically doing it because they're

2037.12 --> 2043.5189999999998
hurting

2039.2 --> 2045.3600000000001
and they deserve it right

2043.519 --> 2048.079
problem is though is that i just don't

2045.36 --> 2051.52
like them

2048.079 --> 2053.44
being in my attention because they don't

2051.52 --> 2056.399
deserve it

2053.44 --> 2056.399
they really don't

2059.839 --> 2065.04
all right finish yeah thanks i agree

2066.399 --> 2070.3199999999997
but look the whole tony thing it was

2068.639 --> 2073.76
such a fizzle

2070.32 --> 2077.599
like people kind of build up tension

2073.76 --> 2079.3590000000004
to him supposedly for me

2077.599 --> 2081.04
but it turned out to be just so

2079.359 --> 2083.7599999999998
unbelievably lame there was

2081.04 --> 2084.079
literally nothing there it was no threat

2083.76 --> 2086.8390000000004
so

2084.079 --> 2089.28
all that's really left is just the

2086.839 --> 2092.32
betrayal

2089.28 --> 2095.28
and the character shift

2092.32 --> 2098.639
to certain individual that's no longer

2095.28 --> 2098.639
welcome in my chat here

2100.72 --> 2105.04
and that thing yeah that's the only

2103.599 --> 2105.6800000000003
thing that's really done any damage

2105.04 --> 2109.44
because this

2105.68 --> 2114.3199999999997
tony guy is just it's just lame

2109.44 --> 2114.32
like hey

2114.56 --> 2120.16
literally falling asleep level of lame

2117.359 --> 2124.4
it's just nothing happening it's just a

2120.16 --> 2126.64
really insecure gamma pretender

2124.4 --> 2129.28
it's a lot of trouble trying to express

2126.64 --> 2132.56
anything genuine of themselves

2129.28 --> 2135.6800000000003
it's just whining all day long

2132.56 --> 2137.71
it's like who wants to listen to that

2135.68 --> 2140.8599999999997
it's unbelievable

2137.71 --> 2140.86
[Music]

2142.8 --> 2150.4
all right yeah well he did that

2146.72 --> 2153.5989999999997
why because he's [ __ ] insane

2150.4 --> 2155.92
try to shake him out of it but

2153.599 --> 2157.119
he's just gone i don't know it's just

2155.92 --> 2159.04
gone into

2157.119 --> 2160.88
self-destruct he's literally just

2159.04 --> 2163.7599999999998
surrendered his autopilot

2160.88 --> 2165.6800000000003
into insanity so yeah there's nothing

2163.76 --> 2167.0400000000004
more i can do about it you know can't be

2165.68 --> 2170.3199999999997
more clear

2167.04 --> 2174.32
he does not respond in any

2170.32 --> 2177.6800000000003
kind of sense that communicates

2174.32 --> 2179.6800000000003
that he's listening to anything that is

2177.68 --> 2182.8799999999997
genuinely directed at him

2179.68 --> 2186.64
so yeah this is just like a passive

2182.88 --> 2188.2400000000002
self-destruct mode doesn't make any

2186.64 --> 2190.3199999999997
freaking sense what he's doing

2188.24 --> 2192.64
not that i really follow him anymore

2190.32 --> 2192.6400000000003
because

2193.04 --> 2201.839
i just don't want to anymore i don't

2194.96 --> 2201.839
want to it's not my problem anymore

2203.599 --> 2207.76
yeah and it's also made me just more

2206.16 --> 2209.839
disgusted

2207.76 --> 2211.44
with people that just latch onto the

2209.839 --> 2214.0
bible

2211.44 --> 2216.2400000000002
and they're all good and then they just

2214.0 --> 2217.119
absolutely betray everything about it

2216.24 --> 2218.7999999999997
and still

2217.119 --> 2221.359
pretend like they didn't do anything

2218.8 --> 2225.6800000000003
wrong or it's just fine

2221.359 --> 2225.68
like a blatant violation

2225.839 --> 2230.0789999999997
and they just ignore it because i don't

2228.48 --> 2231.359
know because christ just forgives

2230.079 --> 2233.6800000000003
anything and then you don't have to

2231.359 --> 2238.48
think about it anymore

2233.68 --> 2238.48
like that that's just crazy

2239.839 --> 2247.44
it's very sick to do that

2243.76 --> 2250.7200000000003
no you're supposed to take it god

2247.44 --> 2254.16
wants you to take it to heart

2250.72 --> 2258.0
and then let it hurt and then you learn

2254.16 --> 2259.839
from the hurt if you're just going to

2258.0 --> 2261.119
swept it aside because i'm you're

2259.839 --> 2264.16
forgiven

2261.119 --> 2271.839
and you don't you ignore it

2264.16 --> 2271.839
you don't take it that's a sin

2272.48 --> 2302.0
and it radiates it stinks all right

2299.28 --> 2304.4
right i'd like to see it as like no not

2302.0 --> 2306.4
all is forgiven

2304.4 --> 2308.88
but you always have a chance to redeem

2306.4 --> 2308.88
yourself

2309.28 --> 2313.28
the biggest danger is believing that you

2311.44 --> 2316.8
don't

2313.28 --> 2316.8
and that is kind of the system

2316.88 --> 2320.8
if you're just going to say there's no

2319.04 --> 2323.92
consequences to what i do

2320.8 --> 2325.2000000000003
because there's this guy once that did

2323.92 --> 2327.599
this incredible thing

2325.2 --> 2328.48
and therefore everything is forgiven uh

2327.599 --> 2332.32
there's a certain

2328.48 --> 2335.359
classification of people out there

2332.32 --> 2338.88
that also think like that or like to

2335.359 --> 2342.88
use that concept to justify

2338.88 --> 2342.88
everything they do

2345.76 --> 2350.8
although they don't really tend to

2348.4 --> 2352.32
believe in christ you know who i speak

2350.8 --> 2355.76
of

2352.32 --> 2359.92
the jew

2355.76 --> 2362.96
right yeah so that's not very christian

2359.92 --> 2363.16
in my opinion that's that's not how i do

2362.96 --> 2366.33
it

2363.16 --> 2366.33
[Music]

2367.599 --> 2372.079
the facing and the recognition of god's

2370.88 --> 2375.359
judgment is a big

2372.079 --> 2382.2400000000002
part of the path honesty

2375.359 --> 2384.16
honesty with yourself

2382.24 --> 2397.839
how can you be honest with the world if

2384.16 --> 2397.839
you're not honest with yourself

2400.88 --> 2406.0
what the soulless humanoid creatures

2404.24 --> 2410.9599999999996
that's a little dramatic their guns have

2406.0 --> 2414.72
never on rmp

2410.96 --> 2417.839
i hope you were not referring to the

2414.72 --> 2420.319
category of people that i mentioned

2417.839 --> 2422.839
i did not read that you might have said

2420.319 --> 2425.839
it before i said it

2422.839 --> 2428.88
sir bit of a freaky

2425.839 --> 2429.44
synchronicity but no i don't think it's

2428.88 --> 2431.52
like that

2429.44 --> 2432.56
it's just a group of people that

2431.52 --> 2435.52
systematically

2432.56 --> 2437.839
follow another pattern a pattern that is

2435.52 --> 2440.96
still made by god

2437.839 --> 2444.48
it's just that and

2440.96 --> 2447.04
as i explained yesterday

2444.48 --> 2449.92
about them that was one of the good

2447.04 --> 2449.92
parts of the show

2450.319 --> 2453.52
they probably like it's a natural

2452.4 --> 2456.8
consequence of

2453.52 --> 2460.8
things that happen of the ability

2456.8 --> 2463.599
to deceive and they just

2460.8 --> 2464.8390000000004
filled the roles and probably by filling

2463.599 --> 2466.2000000000003
their roles and here comes the

2464.839 --> 2468.64
philosophical

2466.2 --> 2470.64
extrapolation by fulfilling the roles

2468.64 --> 2474.0789999999997
they probably stabilized

2470.64 --> 2477.1189999999997
things by being

2474.079 --> 2478.079
the opposition in a spiritual way and

2477.119 --> 2481.839
verify

2478.079 --> 2481.8390000000004
thereby not

2482.319 --> 2485.52
or basically preventing it from popping

2484.8 --> 2488.6400000000003
up

2485.52 --> 2495.839
randomly and uncontrolled yeah

2488.64 --> 2495.839
that's kind of on the wizard level right

2499.68 --> 2505.68
i really think sometimes they are

2502.319 --> 2505.68
they're like the controlled

2506.839 --> 2509.839
darkness

2511.599 --> 2524.8
yeah anyway it's a bit mysterious

2522.48 --> 2528.079
bottle of champagne chilling birthday

2524.8 --> 2533.04
tradition oh it's your birthday

2528.079 --> 2536.6400000000003
cool happy birthday

2533.04 --> 2539.7599999999998
oh hello rob h

2536.64 --> 2541.839
comes and i've run rmp squirters yeah

2539.76 --> 2545.3590000000004
well you know

2541.839 --> 2549.2
this is also a bit difficult

2545.359 --> 2550.48
oh going again see you later guns have

2549.2 --> 2553.5989999999997
never owned rmp

2550.48 --> 2554.2400000000002
thanks for popping by it's just that

2553.599 --> 2556.2400000000002
when

2554.24 --> 2559.2
these people are so disgusting and

2556.24 --> 2561.7599999999998
delusional and all that [ __ ]

2559.2 --> 2564.96
and then i basically proclaim this harsh

2561.76 --> 2568.48
judgment on them

2564.96 --> 2568.48
up to you know what

2568.8 --> 2575.76
like get yourself out in the picture

2572.16 --> 2578.7999999999997
but it's really tough to

2575.76 --> 2580.1600000000003
because they are still people they might

2578.8 --> 2582.8
have simply

2580.16 --> 2584.48
like this is their peak step something

2582.8 --> 2586.88
they would never physically do in the

2584.48 --> 2589.44
real world so it might simply be like

2586.88 --> 2590.4
super desperate need to just express

2589.44 --> 2592.48
this form

2590.4 --> 2593.839
of communication because in their real

2592.48 --> 2595.599
life they have no

2593.839 --> 2597.7599999999998
chance of expressing any of that to

2595.599 --> 2598.96
anyone without [ __ ] their pants

2597.76 --> 2602.48
instantly

2598.96 --> 2603.28
so they just have this insatiable insane

2602.48 --> 2606.48
need to just

2603.28 --> 2608.1600000000003
express that little segment

2606.48 --> 2610.4
might be a big segment then i got a

2608.16 --> 2612.7999999999997
problem

2610.4 --> 2614.88
and thereby then condemning them as the

2612.8 --> 2619.28
way i do

2614.88 --> 2619.28
then seems a little harsh because

2619.76 --> 2623.0400000000004
it yeah i probably hit it right on the

2621.599 --> 2624.7200000000003
nail or yeah

2623.04 --> 2625.96
right on the head there and he'll write

2624.72 --> 2629.1389999999997
on the head

2625.96 --> 2629.139
[Music]

2629.599 --> 2634.96
it's really like maybe it was kind of

2632.72 --> 2637.5989999999997
predicted to me you know back in the day

2634.96 --> 2638.0
social media studies people that did

2637.599 --> 2640.319
that

2638.0 --> 2643.28
and that i heard out about it because

2640.319 --> 2645.68
they were interested in talking about it

2643.28 --> 2648.5600000000004
saying that the troll phenomena that it

2645.68 --> 2651.1189999999997
really is born from just a

2648.56 --> 2651.92
desperation of expression in a certain

2651.119 --> 2654.1600000000003
fashion

2651.92 --> 2656.4
that you can do anonymously so you don't

2654.16 --> 2656.3999999999996
risk

2656.64 --> 2662.24
breaking your entire social life apart

2660.319 --> 2664.72
and that there's just a lot of different

2662.24 --> 2665.04
people that really don't know what to do

2664.72 --> 2666.9599999999996
with

2665.04 --> 2668.96
certain elements of their ego so they

2666.96 --> 2672.319
then anonymously go on the internet and

2668.96 --> 2674.48
then the second persona comes out

2672.319 --> 2675.839
like a super villain version of

2674.48 --> 2678.96
themselves

2675.839 --> 2681.359
that can express these niche

2678.96 --> 2682.4
needs that they could never utilize in

2681.359 --> 2687.2799999999997
the physical

2682.4 --> 2687.28
world face to face because of the

2688.839 --> 2692.96
consequences

2690.24 --> 2696.24
yeah and then suddenly all this supposed

2692.96 --> 2701.04
justification of dooming them to hell

2696.24 --> 2701.04
suddenly it's like oh [ __ ]

2703.76 --> 2706.96
they're probably just a really desperate

2706.0 --> 2710.16
person

2706.96 --> 2712.4
in some way and they may just

2710.16 --> 2713.68
show themselves to be that disgusting

2712.4 --> 2715.92
and ugly

2713.68 --> 2718.0
specifically because of this need to

2715.92 --> 2719.76
basically do yeah

2718.0 --> 2721.44
without somebody punching them in the

2719.76 --> 2723.3590000000004
face immediately

2721.44 --> 2727.52
which they're probably faced with on a

2723.359 --> 2727.52
daily basis on school or something

2727.92 --> 2732.079
so that is that it's more the expression

2730.4 --> 2735.76
it's not necessarily who they

2732.079 --> 2738.0
are even though it is

2735.76 --> 2739.5200000000004
springing forth from something real and

2738.0 --> 2741.359
that's also why it can

2739.52 --> 2746.48
extra trigger because it's really meant

2741.359 --> 2749.92
because it's an element of their person

2746.48 --> 2752.96
it's just taken out of con

2749.92 --> 2756.0
yeah it's discontorted made unnatural

2752.96 --> 2761.839
into a manipulative

2756.0 --> 2761.839
gesture version right

2762.48 --> 2766.8
but yeah then again my response

2767.76 --> 2771.76
sometimes my little experience slightly

2770.0 --> 2774.16
extreme responses

2771.76 --> 2775.3590000000004
are kind of also that because again i've

2774.16 --> 2777.839
even explained this

2775.359 --> 2779.7599999999998
i would never say such things on that

2777.839 --> 2780.96
level to somebody's face that's just

2779.76 --> 2784.88
crazy

2780.96 --> 2784.88
i would never even follow that route

2785.04 --> 2790.0
because it's just ridiculous to address

2787.92 --> 2793.599
people like that face to face that's

2790.0 --> 2793.599
just insane

2794.0 --> 2799.2
so it's kind of weird that you see me

2796.72 --> 2802.72
doing this here

2799.2 --> 2804.7999999999997
on camera and then i get extreme

2802.72 --> 2807.04
well it's actually kind of an internet

2804.8 --> 2808.6400000000003
level response

2807.04 --> 2810.24
like more an internet chat level

2808.64 --> 2814.4
response that i just

2810.24 --> 2816.64
verbally and visually do and with that

2814.4 --> 2819.6800000000003
yeah some taunting elements also

2816.64 --> 2819.68
visually come through

2819.92 --> 2823.92
because i it's it's weird when i was a

2821.68 --> 2826.64
kid i i did that too

2823.92 --> 2829.28
i basically tried to lure people into

2826.64 --> 2831.2799999999997
like coming after me and [ __ ]

2829.28 --> 2833.0400000000004
i was way too good at it it got myself

2831.28 --> 2834.0
to troll but i was very good at running

2833.04 --> 2836.24
too

2834.0 --> 2838.56
so it was just this thing that i did as

2836.24 --> 2838.56
a kid

2839.44 --> 2843.599
sometimes when i felt like it was in a

2841.839 --> 2846.64
jester moon

2843.599 --> 2849.28
just [ __ ] around with people sometimes

2846.64 --> 2849.839
really annoying but never like never

2849.28 --> 2853.2000000000003
actually

2849.839 --> 2856.839
hurtful just really annoying like poking

2853.2 --> 2859.1189999999997
somebody constantly until they just go

2856.839 --> 2862.16
berserk

2859.119 --> 2862.1600000000003
yeah i was that kid

2865.599 --> 2869.52
also not always sometimes i was very

2868.88 --> 2873.7000000000003
fragile

2869.52 --> 2876.82
and sometimes it was very

2873.7 --> 2876.8199999999997
[Music]

2878.16 --> 2887.839
what book huh

2881.52 --> 2887.839
flyers tarot deck interesting

2894.559 --> 2898.559
right so yeah it's just good to address

2897.68 --> 2902.5589999999997
that for

2898.559 --> 2904.8
for a moment basically

2902.559 --> 2906.1600000000003
share a piece of knowledge that'll force

2904.8 --> 2908.7200000000003
me

2906.16 --> 2911.04
if i want to stay honest to hold back a

2908.72 --> 2914.64
little bit more

2911.04 --> 2916.16
with yeah delusional squirters that get

2914.64 --> 2919.92
in my chat

2916.16 --> 2923.1189999999997
and people that just try to break

2919.92 --> 2923.119
my show in some way

2924.16 --> 2929.839
that breakfast is kicking in already all

2926.839 --> 2929.839
right

2954.839 --> 2957.839

cameron gilmore

3012.64 --> 3017.92
in ways everybody does that you know

3015.68 --> 3019.52
that's why they are active on the

3017.92 --> 3021.28
internet because they can express

3019.52 --> 3022.4
themselves on a certain level that's

3021.28 --> 3027.8390000000004
different

3022.4 --> 3027.839
as the face-to-face world

3029.04 --> 3034.88
yeah especially flat earthers everybody

3032.24 --> 3034.8799999999997
knows why

3036.079 --> 3040.2400000000002
because you get into a lot of hassle in

3039.2 --> 3055.839
the face-to-face

3040.24 --> 3055.839
world talking about flat earth

3066.839 --> 3069.839

3165.359 --> 3167.839

3168.16 --> 3173.2799999999997
i think it's at a venerable stage at

3170.72 --> 3173.2799999999997

doing it to conspiracy theory channels

3221.119 --> 3225.76
only does it even to small

3222.8 --> 3225.76
music channels

3229.2 --> 3233.2799999999997
i would disagree because it's still

3231.2 --> 3235.68
doing that to my channel you know i get

3233.28 --> 3240.7200000000003
a lot of down votes sometimes and then

3235.68 --> 3240.72

the votes with

sock accounts yeah those are personally

3290.88 --> 3294.88

satanic advertisement by tony himself

my

3388.72 --> 3393.5989999999997

[Music]

3495.04 --> 3499.2799999999997
youtube should do something about this

why

3501.44 --> 3507.359
what can they do there's always going to

3505.119 --> 3508.1600000000003
be miserable people on the internet that

3507.359 --> 3509.68
are going to get

3508.16 --> 3511.52
obsessed with other people and then

3509.68 --> 3514.5589999999997
start trolling them

3511.52 --> 3517.599
it's happening everywhere now

3514.559 --> 3520.1600000000003
unless you want to somehow send lawyers

3517.599 --> 3520.1600000000003
after them

3520.4 --> 3525.04
they're not going to stop not really

3523.119 --> 3526.799
until they [ __ ] with the wrong person

3525.04 --> 3530.48
that actually does have

3526.799 --> 3536.319
secretly or whatever money for that

3530.48 --> 3536.319
and then yeah they got a problem

3536.88 --> 3545.839

3545.92 --> 3549.359
i don't really know what i can do at

3601.599 --> 3605.3590000000004
i don't particularly like it but i do

3604.0 --> 3610.0
like

3605.359 --> 3610.64
knowing the sneaky [ __ ] that he's trying

3610.0 --> 3612.96
out like

3610.64 --> 3615.2
why you know some people would be

3612.96 --> 3617.2
flustered by what he just did

3615.2 --> 3618.799
they'd be like oh well let's leave it

3617.2 --> 3621.2
there no i get

3618.799 --> 3622.0
exactly what he's doing because he is on

3621.2 --> 3625.2
that level

3622.0 --> 3626.24
of delusional audience like you got to

3625.2 --> 3628.64
be

3626.24 --> 3630.16
very deeply delusional to follow him and

3628.64 --> 3630.8799999999997
there's apparently plenty of people

3630.16 --> 3635.1189999999997
around that

3630.88 --> 3637.599
are and yeah they will fall for anything

3635.119 --> 3639.92
so if he does that then he can basically

3637.599 --> 3640.839
cut things out and then show it like oh

3639.92 --> 3643.839
look

3640.839 --> 3646.0
see that was not me

3643.839 --> 3649.52
that was one of his followers they are

3646.0 --> 3654.319
making the soccer cons to do this

3649.52 --> 3654.319
yeah and i'm not falling for it

3654.4 --> 3660.0
because it's just lame and i don't want

3657.52 --> 3662.96
you're not gonna get your lame ass foot

3660.0 --> 3671.839
in between this door

3662.96 --> 3671.839
with your stupid little tricks

3674.88 --> 3680.6400000000003
i know because that's what he didn't

3678.079 --> 3680.6400000000003
want to hear

3682.96 --> 3688.0
that word it's lame that word that's

3685.28 --> 3690.96
words the problem that's the big problem

3688.0 --> 3690.96
anything but that

3693.04 --> 3697.359
that's why i called it lame because

3696.0 --> 3701.04
that's exactly what it is

3697.359 --> 3704.24
it's impotent futile

3701.04 --> 3707.68
cheap and

3704.24 --> 3707.68
just short-sighted

3707.839 --> 3711.44
devious in a yeah very cheap level it's

3710.72 --> 3714.799
just

3711.44 --> 3727.839
lame really stupid not amusing at all

3714.799 --> 3727.839
not interesting at all

3728.64 --> 3733.359
yeah but they are vigilantes go after

3731.76 --> 3736.559
some criminals then

3733.359 --> 3739.44
well they can't

3736.559 --> 3741.52
they're just squirting and pretending

3739.44 --> 3743.76
just they're there to pretend

3741.52 --> 3744.64
feel like they are doing something like

3743.76 --> 3747.6800000000003
that

3744.64 --> 3749.44
when it's played a superhero in a very

3747.68 --> 3751.7599999999998
dumb game

3749.44 --> 3753.44
like little kids playing acting like

3751.76 --> 3755.28
that with each other like oh

3753.44 --> 3757.039
we're heroes now we're gonna do this

3755.28 --> 3758.48
that's exactly what it is except on the

3757.039 --> 3760.96
internet with a bunch of delusional

3758.48 --> 3760.96
followers

3761.44 --> 3766.2400000000002
because people that actually go after

3763.599 --> 3769.2000000000003
criminals never act like this

3766.24 --> 3769.7599999999998
because that's how you get killed

3769.2 --> 3772.96
because

3769.76 --> 3776.0
real criminals they actually

3772.96 --> 3780.16
yeah you don't do that

3776.0 --> 3783.599
this is extremely dangerous yeah so keep

3780.16 --> 3786.72
yeah keyboard cowboy

3783.599 --> 3789.52
see it's just all make believe

3786.72 --> 3789.52
pretend [ __ ]

3794.839 --> 3797.839
dumb

3799.69 --> 3802.809
[Music]

3809.839 --> 3812.16
right

3817.92 --> 3821.039
cowboy with a k

3822.079 --> 3826.4
they should go and read the bible it's

3823.68 --> 3826.3999999999996
not gonna help

3829.76 --> 3834.48
they have probably and they just got the

3832.48 --> 3836.96
wrong thing out of it

3834.48 --> 3838.4
because they did not have the correct

3836.96 --> 3842.4
spirit to guide them

3838.4 --> 3845.52
and to point where they went wrong

3842.4 --> 3845.52
i tried to do that

3846.559 --> 3851.44
and yeah you just ignored me so

3851.52 --> 3854.799
that's it they don't have the right

3853.68 --> 3856.72
spirit and as i

3854.799 --> 3858.72
explained many times before the bible is

3856.72 --> 3862.319
a multi-dimensional book

3858.72 --> 3863.52
and it'll give you whatever you put into

3862.319 --> 3865.2
it with your spirit

3863.52 --> 3868.16
wherever you're going to look you're

3865.2 --> 3871.68
going to find what you're looking for

3868.16 --> 3881.5989999999997
even from a delusional state

3871.68 --> 3883.7599999999998
and even from a darkness perspective

3881.599 --> 3885.44
so yeah that's why some people are

3883.76 --> 3888.88
literally lost in the book

3885.44 --> 3892.319
and they become devil persecutors and

3888.88 --> 3895.839
insane and completely don't live

3892.319 --> 3895.839
by everything that christ taught

3899.44 --> 3902.64
because yeah whatever you bring to the

3901.68 --> 3906.64
book it

3902.64 --> 3909.2799999999997
you will find it it doesn't guarantee

3906.64 --> 3911.2799999999997
you'll come out of it better or the

3909.28 --> 3914.3190000000004
right way

3911.28 --> 3914.3190000000004
it's just what you bring

3915.0 --> 3920.96
[Music]

3917.52 --> 3922.799
or in yeah like if you were for example

3920.96 --> 3924.96
taught about the bible by your parents

3922.799 --> 3928.079
it's what your parents will bring

3924.96 --> 3931.28
that's what you pick up on as a kid

3928.079 --> 3931.28
when you're confronted with it

3931.599 --> 3938.079
so the spirit that you bring

3936.319 --> 3939.7599999999998
and the philosophies that you bring to

3938.079 --> 3942.96
the bible as you read it

3939.76 --> 3946.88
is going to make you go

3942.96 --> 3949.44
and find things from that perspective

3946.88 --> 3950.0
that's why so many people have basically

3949.44 --> 3951.839
testified

3950.0 --> 3954.4
to you reading the bible all their life

3951.839 --> 3956.88
and every time it's different

3954.4 --> 3958.0
because they probably approached it with

3956.88 --> 3960.6400000000003
a different

3958.0 --> 3965.839
angle and then found something else in

3960.64 --> 3965.839
it because it's a multi-dimensional book

3967.04 --> 3971.659
[Music]

3976.0 --> 3979.179
[Music]

3991.52 --> 3996.16
wow michael jones yeah now well that's

3993.839 --> 4000.16
the same for me

3996.16 --> 4003.44
but for me it was just hearing his voice

4000.16 --> 4006.16
for just a minute told me

4003.44 --> 4006.559
everything i needed you can hear so much

4006.16 --> 4009.52
you know

4006.559 --> 4011.039
i can hear so much in a voice it's

4009.52 --> 4013.119
unbelievable

4011.039 --> 4014.4
it's like a giant four-dimensional

4013.119 --> 4016.88
picture

4014.4 --> 4020.559
of what they are you can hear every i

4016.88 --> 4023.44
can hear everything in somebody's voice

4020.559 --> 4025.3590000000004
and sometimes i can just be enthralled

4023.44 --> 4028.559
by somebody because i can hear something

4025.359 --> 4031.68
in their voice that i do not understand

4028.559 --> 4035.52
there's like hidden areas that's like

4031.68 --> 4037.7599999999998
my multi multi-dimensional

4035.52 --> 4039.52
explorer instinct kicks in it's like

4037.76 --> 4042.079
whoa there's this mystery i want to know

4039.52 --> 4042.079
what this is

4043.76 --> 4049.8390000000004
yeah but this guy is just

4050.16 --> 4054.48
everything's fake no purpose

4055.599 --> 4059.3590000000004
it's completely drowned in safari

4058.4 --> 4063.839
syndrome

4059.359 --> 4063.839
to the bitter bottom

4069.2 --> 4074.5589999999997
right yeah and you by the way guys you

4071.68 --> 4077.7599999999998
got to be careful with it

4074.559 --> 4079.44
you got to be very careful with

4077.76 --> 4082.0
hanging around these people you know

4079.44 --> 4085.76
because hey

4082.0 --> 4087.2
when you go undercover try to infiltrate

4085.76 --> 4088.88
an orc army

4087.2 --> 4091.1189999999997
you're going to be surrounded by orc

4088.88 --> 4092.2400000000002
noise and you're going to be surrounded

4091.119 --> 4094.4
by orcs stink

4092.24 --> 4096.5599999999995
and eventually that orc stink is going

4094.4 --> 4098.56
to rub off on you

4096.56 --> 4100.799
and then at some point you're going to

4098.56 --> 4104.0
probably eat orc food

4100.799 --> 4107.199
and before you know it

4104.0 --> 4110.0
you kind of get stuck and become an

4107.199 --> 4111.759
orc like it starts to take you you got

4110.0 --> 4114.4
to be careful with that [ __ ]

4111.759 --> 4115.6
don't hang around with orcs too long or

4114.4 --> 4117.599999999999
you risk

4115.6 --> 4119.679
basically becoming one of them they're

4117.6 --> 4122.0
taking on bad habits

4119.679 --> 4124.2390000000005
it's just my warning and that's also why

4122.0 --> 4125.92
i'm so very careful with where i hang

4124.239 --> 4130.159
around

4125.92 --> 4130.159
it's just wrong i gotta go quick

4130.64 --> 4133.839
because otherwise i'll get sick

4134.88 --> 4138.0
that's just general

4139.12 --> 4153.199
in general

4146.66 --> 4157.3589999999995
[Music]

4153.199 --> 4157.3589999999995
orcs of a feather flock together

4157.839 --> 4177.759
that's a good one man beardela

4175.6 --> 4179.6
all right voynich well a voice does not

4177.759 --> 4180.319
just reflect their personality it

4179.6 --> 4183.1990000000005
reflects

4180.319 --> 4189.839000000001
everything it reflects their entire

4183.199 --> 4189.839
spirit's journey

4191.679 --> 4198.2390000000005
it's yeah

4195.36 --> 4200.4
sometimes eyes sometimes the voice it

4198.239 --> 4204.0
depends on your nature

4200.4 --> 4205.839999999999
is like both can be the gate to the soul

4204.0 --> 4207.76
and the soul is basically like the

4205.84 --> 4210.64
preponderance of

4207.76 --> 4210.64
the experience

4211.44 --> 4217.839999999999
that's what you find there with when you

4213.679 --> 4217.84
look with your spirit

4233.92 --> 4237.679
right but anyway

4239.04 --> 4246.159
not a threat but

4242.88 --> 4246.159000000001
yeah a study object

4246.8 --> 4251.52
that's how i see it it's like oh yeah

4249.12 --> 4254.4
there's another one

4251.52 --> 4256.84
and they're picking on me now and it's

4254.4 --> 4259.199
kind of typical because i

4256.84 --> 4262.2390000000005
am

4259.199 --> 4264.879999999999
kind of because i do a two-hour show now

4262.239 --> 4265.44
i again have a little trouble now that

4264.88 --> 4269.12
my

4265.44 --> 4272.5599999999995
fountain of energy has basically stopped

4269.12 --> 4274.8
after that weak sickness i'm like oh

4272.56 --> 4277.1990000000005
right i have to fill it somehow now this

4274.8 --> 4280.64
was also a problem with ranty

4277.199 --> 4283.04
earlier and even yeah with all of them

4280.64 --> 4286.400000000001
it's like how do you actually fill it

4283.04 --> 4289.44
when there's not constant energy flowing

4286.4 --> 4290.799999999999
and then a lot of people are seduced to

4289.44 --> 4293.44
basically getting

4290.8 --> 4295.12
a troll thing going or they even start

4293.44 --> 4296.08
to attack somebody because they have to

4295.12 --> 4298.84
say something

4296.08 --> 4301.199
right well i don't do that out of

4298.84 --> 4303.12
principle

4301.199 --> 4304.32
is because it's very counterproductive

4303.12 --> 4307.679
and

4304.32 --> 4308.96
people don't they don't they do remember

4307.679 --> 4312.64
that

4308.96 --> 4312.64
and they just trust you less

4313.6 --> 4316.320000000001
that's not good

4320.08 --> 4323.84
did randy troll me a lot

4326.96 --> 4331.52
and first i thought yeah it was like

4328.88 --> 4334.64
supposed a friendly trolling

4331.52 --> 4335.92
but i just didn't appreciate it and he

4334.64 --> 4339.12
got very pushy

4335.92 --> 4339.12
and naggy sometimes

4340.56 --> 4344.0
like trying to deliberately break my

4343.28 --> 4346.5599999999995
flow

4344.0 --> 4347.36
get in my way it's extremely annoying

4346.56 --> 4350.400000000001
and then

4347.36 --> 4351.04
after he gave me the camera supposedly

4350.4 --> 4354.879999999999
as

4351.04 --> 4357.12
like a maneuver to make things all right

4354.88 --> 4359.92
i thought like oh wow he actually means

4357.12 --> 4363.12
it then i got it and guess what happens

4359.92 --> 4365.679
months and months of socks whining about

4363.12 --> 4368.84
why aren't you using the camera oh you

4365.679 --> 4371.679
never thanked randy

4368.84 --> 4375.52
yeah that was great

4371.679 --> 4378.0
thanks that was extremely annoying

4375.52 --> 4380.56
actually considered at one point just

4378.0 --> 4381.04
on camera destroying the camera just to

4380.56 --> 4384.719
say go

4381.04 --> 4388.0
screw yourself i don't want your [ __ ]

4384.719 --> 4389.84
but then i thought that's a waste of a

4388.0 --> 4391.52
very good functioning device

4389.84 --> 4393.28
then i should probably just give it to

4391.52 --> 4396.2390000000005
somebody else

4393.28 --> 4398.08
instead or just keep it until this

4396.239 --> 4400.799999999999
nonsense is blown over and i can

4398.08 --> 4403.36
just forget about that part and use the

4400.8 --> 4405.28
camera whenever i feel like it

4403.36 --> 4406.719
now there might be somebody i might give

4405.28 --> 4409.84
it to

4406.719 --> 4409.84
who is actually like

4410.159 --> 4414.5599999999995
a hobby photographer it happens to be

4412.8 --> 4416.56
that friend

4414.56 --> 4419.120000000001
that i have phone calls with sometimes

4416.56 --> 4423.04
that has the kid

4419.12 --> 4426.64
so i might give it to her or

4423.04 --> 4428.96
not i don't know i don't know exactly

4426.64 --> 4430.400000000001
but yeah for everybody that really

4428.96 --> 4431.52
always wanted me to become a

4430.4 --> 4433.679
photographer

4431.52 --> 4435.4400000000005
i'm sorry i'm not much of a photographer

4433.679 --> 4436.4
i'm more a guy sitting in front of a

4435.44 --> 4438.159
webcam

4436.4 --> 4440.239
blabbering on about everything

4438.159 --> 4445.839999999999
conceivable all day long

4440.239 --> 4445.839999999999
that's my thing so it turns out to be

4448.159 --> 4453.92
now i don't feel guilty it's not i don't

4451.6 --> 4455.84
why would you say that did i say that i

4453.92 --> 4459.04
felt guilty

4455.84 --> 4460.64
no i felt annoyed because i thought it

4459.04 --> 4462.96
was genuine

4460.64 --> 4465.84
and then i just got the troll the [ __ ]

4462.96 --> 4465.84
out of it with it

4466.0 --> 4483.76
so i feel fooled don't feel guilty

4470.239 --> 4486.32
why would i feel guilty

4483.76 --> 4486.320000000001
or whatever

4487.76 --> 4493.6
oh he's trying to make me feel guilty

4489.52 --> 4493.6
well yeah good luck with that

4494.32 --> 4499.5199999999995
you can't make me feel guilty i will

4497.199 --> 4500.32
feel guilty when i will feel guilty and

4499.52 --> 4502.159000000001
that might be

4500.32 --> 4503.92
in occasions that people don't even

4502.159 --> 4506.08
expect you can't

4503.92 --> 4508.84
make me feel guilty because you think

4506.08 --> 4513.199
that fits some kind of a

4508.84 --> 4513.1990000000005
normalcy that doesn't work with me

4514.48 --> 4519.5199999999995
yeah and i don't owe him he screwed me

4518.159 --> 4522.879999999999
over and it was supposedly

4519.52 --> 4525.360000000001
a make it all right gift

4522.88 --> 4528.4800000000005
and then he basically shat all over that

4525.36 --> 4532.48
by trolling me for months and then

4528.48 --> 4539.839999999999
so yeah no i don't feel guilty

4532.48 --> 4539.839999999999
you just used it to nag me

4540.95 --> 4547.92
[Music]

4543.36 --> 4551.679
i owed him yeah i did owe him

4547.92 --> 4554.2390000000005
and then he started to troll me nonstop

4551.679 --> 4554.88
and now i no longer owe him because he

4554.239 --> 4558.0
got

4554.88 --> 4561.12
his delight

4558.0 --> 4562.88
or whatever out of it his trolling

4561.12 --> 4564.4
he had a justification for trolling and

4562.88 --> 4581.84
now it's over

4564.4 --> 4581.839999999999
now he played his card and it's done

4584.32 --> 4595.84
tricky it's tricky

4587.44 --> 4595.839999999999
yeah well that's what grabblers are

4608.719 --> 4611.04
what

4612.719 --> 4615.679
did i miss something

4618.0 --> 4624.0
what are you serious raw page

4624.88 --> 4637.84
that sounds like complete [ __ ]

4644.69 --> 4648.879999999999
[Music]

4647.36 --> 4650.719
no work these days for interior

4648.88 --> 4655.04
decorator

4650.719 --> 4657.52
hmm okay

4655.04 --> 4659.28
that is a good argument i didn't think

4657.52 --> 4665.52
of that

4659.28 --> 4667.599999999999
because that was its job right

4665.52 --> 4670.64
but why would that mean he would lose

4667.6 --> 4670.64
his house though

4674.64 --> 4682.320000000001
i i don't know about that part you know

4679.04 --> 4683.84
he might be like yeah adding a couple of

4682.32 --> 4687.679
extra card in his hand

4683.84 --> 4690.0
there just to be a little extra dramatic

4687.679 --> 4691.679
because he might be in financial trouble

4690.0 --> 4693.84
because it does make sense that yeah the

4691.679 --> 4696.4800000000005
lockdown is going to affect his

4693.84 --> 4696.4800000000005
his job

4698.0 --> 4702.08
yeah and by the way that does not make

4699.679 --> 4705.679
me happy to hear that

4702.08 --> 4709.199
because yeah it was honest work

4705.679 --> 4712.2390000000005
that should not be taken away from a man

4709.199 --> 4714.239
for no damn reason

4712.239 --> 4718.32
even if they did make a really stupid

4714.239 --> 4718.32
hypey video about how dangerous covert

4718.84 --> 4721.84
was

4723.36 --> 4735.839999999999
so yeah i hope that kind of works out

4725.84 --> 4735.84
for him

4740.56 --> 4748.0
yeah the lockdowns guys it's so crazy

4744.56 --> 4751.52
like a lockdown say 20 years ago

4748.0 --> 4753.679
would be inconceivable

4751.52 --> 4755.4400000000005
and now it's they're just doing it

4753.679 --> 4757.12
sporadically here and there like it's

4755.44 --> 4759.678999999999
the time to test it out

4757.12 --> 4759.679
and people

4760.719 --> 4767.12
are like hesitant in

4764.4 --> 4767.5199999999995
full out resisting it they're hesitant

4767.12 --> 4771.44
now

4767.52 --> 4771.4400000000005
it's crazy why

4773.28 --> 4776.639999999999
why is not just everybody saying yes

4775.36 --> 4778.88
screw you

4776.64 --> 4781.12
what fines it's all [ __ ] it's all

4778.88 --> 4785.4400000000005
bureaucracy illegal [ __ ]

4781.12 --> 4785.44
nobody can find you for anything like

4788.84 --> 4791.84
that

4792.8 --> 4796.56
i'd almost try to figure out a system

4795.199 --> 4799.919999999999
where you just say like okay

4796.56 --> 4801.52
everybody like you all come together

4799.92 --> 4802.64
like all the businesses in the city or

4801.52 --> 4805.92
whatever just say okay

4802.64 --> 4808.719
just we're going to make this deal

4805.92 --> 4810.159
it's going to be a trick and just say no

4808.719 --> 4811.84
we're keeping everything open

4810.159 --> 4814.32
open declaration everything open no

4811.84 --> 4816.96
lockdown no anything no masks

4814.32 --> 4817.679
yeah just send us the bill you find us

4816.96 --> 4820.88
fine

4817.679 --> 4822.96
find us oh and by the way

4820.88 --> 4825.36
nobody's gonna pay it not a single

4822.96 --> 4825.36
person

4825.679 --> 4830.56
they do we're gonna look him up and make

4828.0 --> 4834.32
him sorry for it

4830.56 --> 4836.96
right and then yeah it's all really nice

4834.32 --> 4839.92
all this giant amount of fines and then

4836.96 --> 4842.08
once the government local or national is

4839.92 --> 4844.56
under control again

4842.08 --> 4845.12
it's just gonna be treated the way it

4844.56 --> 4848.2390000000005
should be

4845.12 --> 4851.679
and scrapped by

4848.239 --> 4854.799999999999
a judge like yeah it was illegal

4851.679 --> 4856.4
it's all negated that's what should be

4854.8 --> 4859.360000000001
happening people

4856.4 --> 4860.638999999999
why is there not a single example of

4859.36 --> 4862.95
this

4860.639 --> 4865.12
i don't understand

4862.95 --> 4868.48
[Music]

4865.12 --> 4870.239
why don't i hear about cities doing just

4868.48 --> 4873.12
that

4870.239 --> 4873.12
just saying nope

4873.36 --> 4877.599999999999
like the only country so far that's

4877.679 --> 4883.6
that's actually really stopped it

4881.12 --> 4884.239
or just treated it differently and still

4883.6 --> 4888.2390000000005
kind of

4884.239 --> 4891.44
belongs is is sweden

4888.239 --> 4891.44
it just said nope

4893.36 --> 4899.12
just no lockdown why

4896.719 --> 4902.0
is nobody doing this they have the best

4899.12 --> 4906.08
results this is insane it's criminal

4902.0 --> 4908.32
it's blatant so why aren't people

4906.08 --> 4909.6
just recognizing the situation for what

4908.32 --> 4913.92
it is

4909.6 --> 4918.08
it's a corporate media government

4913.92 --> 4920.96
coup it's an attempt to basically take

4918.08 --> 4922.96
break the constitution and the people's

4920.96 --> 4925.12
spirit demoralize them and just make

4922.96 --> 4929.12
them do whatever the [ __ ] they want

4925.12 --> 4933.28
it's illegal they should legally

4929.12 --> 4935.199
be able to just say screw that

4933.28 --> 4936.8
now don't get into fights because that's

4935.199 --> 4940.96
never good

4936.8 --> 4943.4400000000005
it's always yeah just more [ __ ]

4940.96 --> 4945.04
but smart well thought out passive

4943.44 --> 4945.36
resistance like i basically said just

4945.04 --> 4948.4
say

4945.36 --> 4950.639
okay that's all fine send the bills oh

4948.4 --> 4952.879999999999
and by the way nobody's gonna pay it

4950.639 --> 4954.96
and just don't get peer pressured like

4952.88 --> 4959.4400000000005
make it a thing like this city

4954.96 --> 4961.92
we do not lock down we do not wear masks

4959.44 --> 4963.44
we do not listen to that propaganda if

4961.92 --> 4966.4
you do

4963.44 --> 4968.159
get the [ __ ] out something like that not

4966.4 --> 4969.839999999999
maybe get the [ __ ] out is maybe a little

4968.159 --> 4973.12
dramatic

4969.84 --> 4975.28
but in that train of thinking

4973.12 --> 4979.36
we specifically keep it out and just say

4975.28 --> 4981.04
no it's illegal these fines are illegal

4979.36 --> 4983.199
so yeah it's really nice send the

4981.04 --> 4985.04
paperworks but nobody's going to pay it

4983.199 --> 4988.48
because it's illegal

4985.04 --> 4990.88
and then you keep going oh the bills

4988.48 --> 4993.44
with the corona fines might not work out

4990.88 --> 4996.719
well just scrap the corona fines

4993.44 --> 4998.96
say no just really cute we're not gonna

4996.719 --> 5002.8
[ __ ] pay it

4998.96 --> 5002.8
and then keep doing the rest

5007.44 --> 5011.12
i don't know it's just i'm trying to

5009.36 --> 5012.719
figure it out people like how what you

5011.12 --> 5016.4
can you still do

5012.719 --> 5016.4
because this barrage

5016.48 --> 5021.678999999999
from governments isn't

5019.92 --> 5025.76
doesn't seem to be stopping any times

5021.679 --> 5027.76
and they're just keeping it going

5025.76 --> 5029.1990000000005
so there must be some kind of way to

5027.76 --> 5031.92
actually stop that

5029.199 --> 5033.5199999999995
to deal with this to resist in a

5031.92 --> 5036.56
sensible way without

5033.52 --> 5036.56
turning to violence

5037.28 --> 5040.8
so i really hope that some people will

5039.52 --> 5043.84
take my words

5040.8 --> 5043.84
and hopefully

5044.4 --> 5048.48
figure a way out to somehow achieve such

5046.56 --> 5051.1990000000005
a thing

5048.48 --> 5052.718999999999
with yeah all the legal implications

5051.199 --> 5055.678999999999
that i don't have a grip

5052.719 --> 5056.0
on fully there must be some kind of way

5055.679 --> 5058.88
to

5056.0 --> 5059.36
do this to literally just keep

5058.88 --> 5060.719
everything

5059.36 --> 5062.4
open and just say this is

5060.719 --> 5064.159
unconstitutional where we

5062.4 --> 5065.599999999999
send us the bill we're not going to pay

5064.159 --> 5068.879999999999
it

5065.6 --> 5070.159000000001
there must be a way to do that i hope

5068.88 --> 5072.96
people will think about it

5070.159 --> 5085.839999999999
out there somebody wanted to hear me and

5072.96 --> 5085.84
think about it

5102.56 --> 5104.88
right

5112.0 --> 5117.679
i don't know about even how much

5115.04 --> 5119.199
finding goes on here in the netherlands

5117.679 --> 5122.159
i do know that the media

5119.199 --> 5124.159
really likes to highlight things when

5122.159 --> 5127.199
something happens

5124.159 --> 5130.239
but in general i don't think that

5127.199 --> 5130.5599999999995
i think it's just mostly a bluff and

5130.239 --> 5133.12
they

5130.56 --> 5136.080000000001
if you get too overt about it then they

5133.12 --> 5140.0
sent the corona police after you

5136.08 --> 5140.719
but if you just like yeah if you kind of

5140.0 --> 5143.84
act like

5140.719 --> 5143.84
the resistance

5144.0 --> 5147.28
and just oh the police is there oh wear

5145.76 --> 5149.6
your mask and then like all the police

5147.28 --> 5154.96
is away okay yeah whatever

5149.6 --> 5158.4800000000005
take it off again like

5154.96 --> 5162.56
i've seen people do that like

5158.48 --> 5165.678999999999
not gonna name names get more specific

5162.56 --> 5166.639
so it just seems like really is it all

5165.679 --> 5169.36
that

5166.639 --> 5170.4800000000005
all that hard and or is it just a bluff

5169.36 --> 5172.96
mostly

5170.48 --> 5175.599999999999
and just if you don't get too dradomatic

5172.96 --> 5178.159
then they kind of leave you alone

5175.6 --> 5178.639
but you can kind of ignore it without

5178.159 --> 5180.799999999999
you

5178.639 --> 5182.88
directly risking some kind of fine or

5180.8 --> 5185.28
closing down it's just

5182.88 --> 5185.28
but i

5186.159 --> 5191.679
i haven't really done any research and

5189.28 --> 5193.92
asked specifically oh can you tell me

5191.679 --> 5196.4
this like what's your experience with

5193.92 --> 5198.0
the lockdown so far have you had any

5196.4 --> 5202.638999999999
police no i haven't done any

5198.0 --> 5205.76
actual hearing research like that

5202.639 --> 5209.04
it's just kind of a rough size up

5205.76 --> 5209.04
but in stores that i've went

5214.159 --> 5219.12
so it's weird yeah but you know what i

5216.719 --> 5222.4
mean with la resistance right it is the

5219.12 --> 5222.4
idea it's like this

5222.88 --> 5226.400000000001
this idea of the resistance the french

5225.199 --> 5230.48
resistance

5226.4 --> 5231.5199999999995
has been used in theatrics and in series

5230.48 --> 5234.159
and in movies

5231.52 --> 5237.120000000001
a lot to wear kind of an example how to

5234.159 --> 5240.5599999999995
covertly resist

5237.12 --> 5240.5599999999995
right it's kind of been

5240.8 --> 5247.84
created into a trope and

5243.84 --> 5247.84
people it's rubbed off on a lot of

5250.84 --> 5253.84
people

5256.159 --> 5259.36
the employees

5262.4 --> 5268.638999999999
employers don't want to pay the fines

5266.32 --> 5268.639
what

5271.92 --> 5277.4400000000005
you mean sorry might be mixing up words

5275.28 --> 5278.239
but employers is the one that actually

5277.44 --> 5281.839999999999
hires people

5278.239 --> 5281.839999999999
right it's not

5282.88 --> 5285.1990000000005
right

5289.28 --> 5292.96
yeah they don't want to pay the fines

5290.88 --> 5296.719
yeah that's but that's the whole point

5292.96 --> 5296.719
if people just come together

5296.8 --> 5300.4800000000005
however and just say look nobody pay the

5300.0 --> 5304.08
fines

5300.48 --> 5304.08
we're just going to negate this

5304.56 --> 5309.360000000001
yeah consult a whole load of lawyers for

5307.44 --> 5311.678999999999
that of course

5309.36 --> 5312.96
right there could be a plan made to do

5311.679 --> 5314.719
that

5312.96 --> 5316.4800000000005
and then yeah nobody wants to pay the

5314.719 --> 5318.4
fines well then don't do it don't pay

5316.48 --> 5320.4
the freaking fines

5318.4 --> 5323.839999999999
because it's illegal if you got a if you

5320.4 --> 5323.839999999999
got a defense case for it

5324.08 --> 5326.4
you know

5334.0 --> 5337.84
and they will go broke by their undoing

5338.32 --> 5344.48
yeah indeed so

5341.36 --> 5345.199
i don't understand why they don't get

5344.48 --> 5349.04
together

5345.199 --> 5349.599999999999
and find a strategy man can you imagine

5349.04 --> 5351.6
how many

5349.6 --> 5353.360000000001
lawyers should be out there that are

5351.6 --> 5355.6
just like

5353.36 --> 5357.44
i don't get why i'm not drowning in work

5355.6 --> 5359.52
or maybe they are drowning in work

5357.44 --> 5360.96
anyhow maybe there are some people that

5359.52 --> 5363.4400000000005
are doing things like this and they're

5360.96 --> 5368.159
already preoccupied but

5363.44 --> 5370.48
like why this should be lawyer time

5368.159 --> 5371.839999999999
for a lot of businesses lawyers should

5370.48 --> 5375.5199999999995
be crushing it

5371.84 --> 5375.52
with employment right now

5375.6 --> 5380.8
because of this crazy situation

5378.639 --> 5382.8
now it might be i don't know because i

5380.8 --> 5386.08
haven't gone to a

5382.8 --> 5388.0
legal council recently if i would then i

5386.08 --> 5389.6
would definitely ask like how is it out

5388.0 --> 5392.159
there right now

5389.6 --> 5393.360000000001
are people actually i would i am always

5392.159 --> 5397.5199999999995
curious to these things

5393.36 --> 5397.5199999999995
always so

5422.48 --> 5425.599999999999
yeah tiny wumbo isn't it also

5424.159 --> 5429.44
interesting that

5425.6 --> 5431.360000000001
on average the chinese and the japanese

5429.44 --> 5432.96
have more lung problems have more

5431.36 --> 5435.36
typical

5432.96 --> 5437.44
lung diseases because they've been

5435.36 --> 5438.08
wearing masks for years oh why could

5437.44 --> 5449.839999999999
that be

5438.08 --> 5449.84
huh yeah isn't that just special

5450.239 --> 5455.04
no bit of venom you don't get it masks

5452.48 --> 5457.04
do work

5455.04 --> 5458.8
they work exactly for what they're meant

5457.04 --> 5461.92
to do and that is

5458.8 --> 5463.84
make everybody sick more just a little

5461.92 --> 5465.84
more push that immune system a little

5463.84 --> 5467.92
bit more

5465.84 --> 5469.28
and then people get lung problems and

5467.92 --> 5471.36
then oh look there's lung problems

5469.28 --> 5474.4
everybody wear your mask

5471.36 --> 5477.839999999999
it's a medical scam

5474.4 --> 5479.92
always has been only good reason to wear

5477.84 --> 5484.4800000000005
a mask is if you're

5479.92 --> 5488.159
facing open wound situation surgery

5484.48 --> 5488.159
dentistry that's it

5488.32 --> 5492.96
because of yeah reasons

5493.28 --> 5498.96
if spittle the surgeon

5496.88 --> 5501.28
drops into an open wound that could

5498.96 --> 5505.84
create all kinds of hazards

5501.28 --> 5505.84
so that's just logical

5506.4 --> 5509.44
but yeah that's only in that specific

5508.56 --> 5511.1990000000005
situation

5509.44 --> 5518.0
otherwise it just makes no sense it's

5511.199 --> 5520.5599999999995
just going to be a burden on everyone

5518.0 --> 5522.0
now avoid niche the mask for superheroes

5520.56 --> 5525.1990000000005
are only to

5522.0 --> 5528.8
to mask their identity and remember most

5525.199 --> 5532.799999999999
superheroes have mouth and

5528.8 --> 5535.04
yeah they have mouth open so it's

5532.8 --> 5537.4400000000005
very little superheroes that have masks

5535.04 --> 5547.84
that actually cover their mouth

5537.44 --> 5547.839999999999
like spiderman

5554.88 --> 5558.4800000000005
that's funny yeah isn't it and sensible

5557.36 --> 5560.0
of course because if you're going to be

5558.48 --> 5562.5599999999995
a superhero do a lot of physical

5560.0 --> 5563.84
things you're going to need to breathe a

5562.56 --> 5567.4400000000005
lot

5563.84 --> 5568.0
this is yeah you don't want to wear a

5567.44 --> 5569.599999999999
mask

5568.0 --> 5575.84
when you do that are you going to choke

5569.6 --> 5575.84
on yourself on your own co2

5577.75 --> 5580.939
[Music]

5585.84 --> 5603.84
wow crazy george sanford

5614.84 --> 5617.84
ah

5629.84 --> 5636.400000000001
right yeah by the way with

5634.08 --> 5637.76
i can make another general prediction by

5636.4 --> 5640.879999999999
the way with mask

5637.76 --> 5642.0
situations that is that there's all

5640.88 --> 5644.88
kinds of

5642.0 --> 5645.52
ways to deal with the masks and like

5644.88 --> 5649.1990000000005
when you're

5645.52 --> 5651.1990000000005
going to be sort of mass compliant

5649.199 --> 5653.12
it's going to be the carrots that are

5651.199 --> 5655.199
actually going to act like nazis

5653.12 --> 5657.36
and walk up to people and say you're not

5655.199 --> 5660.32
wearing your mask right

5657.36 --> 5662.159
those are the people that are going to

5660.32 --> 5665.12
end up destroying the business

5662.159 --> 5665.599999999999
wherever they're stationed in general

5665.12 --> 5668.88
that's

5665.6 --> 5672.320000000001
that's my prediction because that

5668.88 --> 5674.719
really annoys people a lot

5672.32 --> 5675.599999999999
the ones that are already complying it's

5674.719 --> 5678.0
like don't

5675.6 --> 5679.1990000000005
[ __ ] with me it's already shitty enough

5678.0 --> 5682.56
we have to do this

5679.199 --> 5684.879999999999
so these carrots they're gonna literally

5682.56 --> 5685.6
make people never come back to that

5684.88 --> 5688.639
store

5685.6 --> 5689.84
because they hate that you don't want to

5688.639 --> 5692.08
go to a store

5689.84 --> 5693.76
and feel like oh god i hate it because

5692.08 --> 5695.04
there's going to be these carrots

5693.76 --> 5697.280000000001
no you're going to seek out another

5695.04 --> 5701.28
store where there's no carrots

5697.28 --> 5703.679
so yeah employees watch out

5701.28 --> 5706.0
for the mask fanatics because they are

5703.679 --> 5709.04
going to destroy your business

5706.0 --> 5710.96
like destroy it sure you don't want to

5709.04 --> 5712.96
get fines but the fanatics

5710.96 --> 5714.0
they are going to destroy your business

5712.96 --> 5716.88
because they're going to send

5714.0 --> 5716.88
everybody away

5717.92 --> 5721.119
that don't want to come back because

5719.6 --> 5725.04
they don't want to face

5721.119 --> 5728.159
that it's really agitating

5725.04 --> 5731.44
to a lot of people so yeah be careful

5728.159 --> 5735.44
with that you don't want your business

5731.44 --> 5735.44
to go bust by having a karen in it

5736.0 --> 5740.84
i'm not just using the word karen

5737.76 --> 5742.159000000001
because it's like wider hitting

5740.84 --> 5744.4800000000005
understanding

5742.159 --> 5746.32
but you know what i mean mask fanatics

5744.48 --> 5748.239
in this case

5746.32 --> 5749.84
they're gonna whine to other people that

5748.239 --> 5751.199
they're not wearing it right or that

5749.84 --> 5754.719
sort of [ __ ] that's

5751.199 --> 5757.839999999999
don't don't do that

5754.719 --> 5757.84
get the [ __ ] out

5759.41 --> 5762.59
[Music]

5776.159 --> 5781.92
oh that's something long thing to wear

5779.28 --> 5781.92
mask oh

5782.84 --> 5785.84
god

5802.719 --> 5807.119
yeah but you know what with all this

5804.56 --> 5809.04
[ __ ] the doctors are gonna get it

5807.119 --> 5811.04
the doctors that are pushing this little

5809.04 --> 5812.719
mask nonsense they're gonna get it

5811.04 --> 5815.5199999999995
because people are also gonna stop

5812.719 --> 5818.4
visiting them

5815.52 --> 5820.320000000001
not because they're not sick but because

5818.4 --> 5822.08
they're just going to find somebody else

5820.32 --> 5825.92
that's not gonna whine to them about

5822.08 --> 5826.239
wearing a mask and give solid advice

5825.92 --> 5828.639
yeah

5826.239 --> 5829.28
actually the mask situation is probably

5828.639 --> 5831.6
spurring

5829.28 --> 5833.36
more people that would have never

5831.6 --> 5836.4800000000005
considered it before

5833.36 --> 5839.119
to seek out alternative

5836.48 --> 5840.08
solutions even on the internet guess

5839.119 --> 5843.44
what they're going to find

5840.08 --> 5846.08
a vast amount of things they can do very

5843.44 --> 5850.4
easily with very little side effects

5846.08 --> 5853.44
and long tradition of effectiveness

5850.4 --> 5856.879999999999
all kinds of things so yeah

5853.44 --> 5859.04
that means eventually less people

5856.88 --> 5860.96
end up going to the doctor because it

5859.04 --> 5863.04
sucks and it's becoming more and more

5860.96 --> 5865.04
useless

5863.04 --> 5866.4
unless yeah there's some doctor that

5865.04 --> 5869.6
actually managed to

5866.4 --> 5872.4
avoid that doing that

5869.6 --> 5873.360000000001
alternative doctors if they can stave

5872.4 --> 5876.879999999999
off the

5873.36 --> 5878.719
the attacks from top down

5876.88 --> 5880.400000000001
from the medical industrial complex if

5878.719 --> 5883.84
they can

5880.4 --> 5883.839999999999
survive that

5886.639 --> 5897.84
so yeah it's all self-destruction

5889.92 --> 5897.84
all of it it's crazy

5908.56 --> 5915.4400000000005
first they came for the socialists

5911.6 --> 5915.4400000000005
and i did not speak out oh

5916.56 --> 5924.96
ouch here we go again ouch that

5919.92 --> 5927.52
that hit home that really hit home

5924.96 --> 5927.52
well i hope

5929.6 --> 5936.56
that i did speak out when they came

5933.36 --> 5938.48
after the socialists because i do get it

5936.56 --> 5941.679
it's just they don't they don't know

5938.48 --> 5941.678999999999
what the hell is going on

5941.84 --> 5946.4800000000005
their system doesn't work anymore

5944.239 --> 5948.48
because this system is no longer what it

5946.48 --> 5952.0
used to be

5948.48 --> 5954.799999999999
it's no longer benevolent

5952.0 --> 5954.8
really isn't

5956.719 --> 5960.32
even though people within the system

5958.639 --> 5963.4400000000005
might still be benevolent

5960.32 --> 5966.88
they are too barraged and forced to

5963.44 --> 5970.4
comply to malevolent

5966.88 --> 5973.76
things it's gonna be very testing on

5970.4 --> 5973.759999999999
their character on the long run

5975.84 --> 5979.84
so yeah you got a good point first they

5977.84 --> 5995.84
came after the

5979.84 --> 5995.84
and i did not speak out yeah

6019.23 --> 6023.839999999999
[Music]

6020.84 --> 6023.84
hmm

6025.24 --> 6028.83
[Music]

6034.0 --> 6038.719
wow here we go again that sounds really

6036.239 --> 6038.718999999999
[ __ ] up

6047.6 --> 6050.639
but in a way i get the feeling it's sort

6049.92 --> 6053.4400000000005
of like that

6050.639 --> 6053.4400000000005
over here too

6053.92 --> 6057.4400000000005
there's a lot of people with serious

6055.92 --> 6059.679
health problems that are

6057.44 --> 6060.719
suffering in my country because of all

6059.679 --> 6063.119
this nonsense

6060.719 --> 6064.88
i could see it i can feel it i feel

6063.119 --> 6067.92
guilty

6064.88 --> 6070.32
for not like radically stepping in and

6067.92 --> 6072.32
basically

6070.32 --> 6074.5599999999995
yeah but where do i start i can't do

6072.32 --> 6078.159
that it's just gonna get arrested

6074.56 --> 6081.52
but yeah i can see it

6078.159 --> 6081.5199999999995
i can see the suffering

6081.84 --> 6086.32
sometimes because i look around i don't

6084.639 --> 6086.96
just stare at the ground when i go

6086.32 --> 6090.96
places

6086.96 --> 6094.56
i look around and i see the infirm

6090.96 --> 6098.0
and the sick like the old like they are

6094.56 --> 6101.76
suffering under this and i feel

6098.0 --> 6106.56
guilty for not doing more about it to

6101.76 --> 6109.679
stop it

6106.56 --> 6111.4400000000005
they would elderly care that like

6109.679 --> 6113.4400000000005
when you do that [ __ ] then you're gonna

6111.44 --> 6116.638999999999
whine about coving restrictions

6113.44 --> 6119.04
too and that's the issue like

6116.639 --> 6120.08
it's like you're not allowed to do it

6119.04 --> 6124.4
right

6120.08 --> 6128.08
anymore because this group

6124.4 --> 6132.839999999999
is in the system just designated to die

6128.08 --> 6135.04
because of this [ __ ] it's really [ __ ]

6132.84 --> 6138.719
up

6135.04 --> 6142.56
it's intolerable

6138.719 --> 6142.56
and dehumanizing

6147.04 --> 6153.84
and completely unnecessary

6150.48 --> 6158.4
don't need to do this there is no

6153.84 --> 6161.4400000000005
sensible reason you know

6158.4 --> 6164.32
all this nonsense you know

6161.44 --> 6166.08
even like from a eugenics perspective

6164.32 --> 6168.08
it's all nonsense

6166.08 --> 6170.96
if we're supposed to like kill off

6168.08 --> 6173.44
people to save the environment and safe

6170.96 --> 6174.84
resources well guess what all this [ __ ]

6173.44 --> 6178.719
is wasting

6174.84 --> 6182.719
more than if you just leave it alone

6178.719 --> 6185.84
that's the reality so it's all a lie

6182.719 --> 6187.199
all of it it's pure satanic delusion

6185.84 --> 6188.8
it's a delusion

6187.199 --> 6191.04
to make you think that it's the right

6188.8 --> 6194.159000000001
thing to do it's very tough

6191.04 --> 6196.4
to save [ __ ] to save resources well

6194.159 --> 6198.159
guess what it's wasting more resources

6196.4 --> 6202.239
than you can imagine

6198.159 --> 6204.96
just doing this it's all a lie

6202.239 --> 6219.839999999999
all of it it's a satanic as you can

6204.96 --> 6219.84
imagine something

6227.679 --> 6246.719
how dare you this is

6230.8 --> 6252.159000000001
classical homeopath all right

6246.719 --> 6252.159
greta what what does she have to do with

6258.84 --> 6261.84
it

6276.0 --> 6278.32
right

6279.28 --> 6283.04
i see a lot of elderly people that don't

6281.679 --> 6285.28
wear masks

6283.04 --> 6287.5199999999995
and they have a bright spark in their

6285.28 --> 6290.8
eyes
