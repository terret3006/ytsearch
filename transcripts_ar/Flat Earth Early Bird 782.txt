it's wednesday the 20th

104.36 --> 107.36
2021

108.56 --> 115.04
and the weather today is

111.68 --> 117.84
cloudy windy and

115.04 --> 120.96000000000001
a little bit of rain here and there but

117.84 --> 120.96000000000001
just a few drops

122.0 --> 128.8
but yeah it's still not super cold so

126.56 --> 130.879
since that time the snow fell it hasn't

128.8 --> 134.64000000000001
really

130.879 --> 134.64
been that cold anymore

135.84 --> 147.2
it hasn't been all that cold

143.52 --> 150.959
it's almost like there's an early spring

147.2 --> 153.599
thing going seeing a lot of people

150.959 --> 154.8
yesterday and the day before just go out

153.599 --> 156.79999999999998
and jog

154.8 --> 158.16000000000003
for some reason it was full of people

156.8 --> 162.4
doing that outside

158.16 --> 166.239
it was it's kind of odd to notice that

162.4 --> 168.84
right right anyway yeah i wasn't there

166.239 --> 172.48000000000002
yesterday

168.84 --> 176.8
uh i don't know man i

172.48 --> 179.51899999999998
i felt kind of tired out

176.8 --> 181.20000000000002
and yeah i woke up yesterday exactly at

179.519 --> 182.4
one o'clock and then i thought like yeah

181.2 --> 185.67999999999998
i'm not gonna

182.4 --> 187.519
just squeeze it squeeze it full power to

185.68 --> 188.4
go in live anyway and then be all

187.519 --> 192.8
flustered

188.4 --> 192.8
i did feel like it so just took a break

192.879 --> 197.51899999999998
and it was good i used it to go out and

195.519 --> 201.04
grocery shopping early

197.519 --> 202.48000000000002
so i didn't have to step away

201.04 --> 206.239
or anything during the flat earth

202.48 --> 206.23899999999998
debates and it was a good debate show

207.76 --> 213.84
that i was a part of so yeah i skipped

210.72 --> 213.84
yesterday's show

214.319 --> 219.92
yeah i'm not going to make a habit of it

217.12 --> 222.239
even though it was kind of good

219.92 --> 224.23899999999998
it's it's funny because other people

222.239 --> 227.12
have suggested to me

224.239 --> 228.959
which is very reasonable like maybe you

227.12 --> 229.68
should do something like a periodic

228.959 --> 232.0
break uh

229.68 --> 233.20000000000002
like don't do the weekends or something

232.0 --> 236.72
and i was just like no

233.2 --> 239.35999999999999
no no it's every day

236.72 --> 240.64
the show is every day that's that's what

239.36 --> 243.04000000000002
it is

240.64 --> 244.48
i can't really step away i don't want to

243.04 --> 247.599
step away from that

244.48 --> 248.319
it's like it's been consistently like

247.599 --> 255.83999999999997
that

248.319 --> 255.83999999999997
and i want to keep it that way

256.88 --> 262.959
right anyway i'm back let's use in chat

263.84 --> 269.59999999999997
that flat fellow's first m

267.04 --> 272.47900000000004
parkway here we go again good to see you

269.6 --> 274.83000000000004
robin stanley

272.479 --> 277.88
yeah good to see you all

274.83 --> 277.88
[Music]

278.639 --> 283.84000000000003
right so

284.56 --> 289.759
i was watching all kinds of things

287.199 --> 289.759
yesterday

290.16 --> 296.88000000000005
and i did make notes but i should have

292.16 --> 300.16
this is

296.88 --> 302.8
man i am having like

300.16 --> 303.68
some yeah minor cold issues although it

302.8 --> 305.44
can't be but

303.68 --> 307.039
yeah i was thinking like maybe it is

305.44 --> 310.71999999999997
like something

307.039 --> 312.4
allergy related

310.72 --> 314.56
because i can't really pinpoint it out

312.4 --> 315.35999999999996
like i don't really have a cold it's

314.56 --> 320.479
just that

315.36 --> 323.68
i have these minor annoying symptoms

320.479 --> 326.56
like being more runny nosy than usual

323.68 --> 326.56
so maybe it is

326.88 --> 333.84
like an early early early spring

331.44 --> 336.96
thing that's just touching me in this

333.84 --> 336.96
way i don't know what it is

337.44 --> 344.24
but yeah not too bothered about it

341.039 --> 346.88
hey more colored good to see you seeking

344.24 --> 346.88
star water

351.68 --> 353.84000000000003
right

361.1 --> 366.56
[Music]

364.08 --> 368.479
right so i've been watching some alex

366.56 --> 371.12
jones

368.479 --> 372.96
and apparently i wasn't the only one

371.12 --> 374.24
being demoralized well of course i

372.96 --> 376.4
wasn't

374.24 --> 377.52
but yeah you could it's there like

376.4 --> 381.52
really

377.52 --> 384.96
on the nerves with it

381.52 --> 388.31899999999996
and they caught yeah

384.96 --> 390.56
that the alex jones has a tooth ache too

388.319 --> 393.6
or whatever so and oh and benjamin had

390.56 --> 396.0
it so i think that a whole lot of people

393.6 --> 398.96000000000004
in america just have been so stressed

396.0 --> 401.36
out that they're all having issues

398.96 --> 402.08
that express themselves in tooth ache

401.36 --> 405.44
it's

402.08 --> 407.84
very telling it's like symbolic

405.44 --> 408.96
this isn't it's in a saying like missing

407.84 --> 412.0
somebody like tooth

408.96 --> 412.0
like a toothache right

412.479 --> 419.36
because it just seems like everything

415.44 --> 419.36
went completely wrong in the united

420.84 --> 426.08
states

423.599 --> 427.599
and alex is bringing out these pieces

426.08 --> 430.71999999999997
and kind of focusing on how

427.599 --> 436.88
q is what he says the trust

430.72 --> 438.72
movement 2 2.0 like a soviet operation

436.88 --> 440.8
and it's interesting though because he

438.72 --> 442.8
has talked about that sort of thing

440.8 --> 444.56
before but now he's getting very

442.8 --> 447.12
specific about it

444.56 --> 451.84
so he's taken on that angle he thinks

447.12 --> 451.84000000000003
that it is an absolute operation

453.36 --> 459.52000000000004
right but

457.28 --> 460.79999999999995
for me personally i am more with owen

459.52 --> 463.599
benjamin

460.8 --> 464.0
like he hasn't gone live on d live for a

463.599 --> 468.08
while

464.0 --> 470.08
but yeah you can still watch his uploads

468.08 --> 472.15999999999997
on bitchute

470.08 --> 473.199
and yeah again watch one yesterday and

472.16 --> 479.84000000000003
was just

473.199 --> 479.84000000000003
really entertaining and good

487.919 --> 492.08
i found more interesting imagery like

490.16 --> 495.759
the japanese grappler

492.08 --> 498.87899999999996
and apparently the

495.759 --> 501.199
idl like you

498.879 --> 503.52000000000004
are using that imagery as like if you

501.199 --> 503.91900000000004
use that imagery for whatever reason it

503.52 --> 506.479
will get

503.919 --> 508.24
flack for anti-semitism so they totally

506.479 --> 512.56
reinforced

508.24 --> 515.44
just the another grabbler image imagery

512.56 --> 517.1199999999999
from another culture it's so weird what

515.44 --> 519.599
they're doing

517.12 --> 520.88
when you think about it because it's

519.599 --> 524.08
just

520.88 --> 524.08
like what was it again the

526.32 --> 530.9590000000001
what's the name again it was something

529.44 --> 533.9200000000001
japanese

530.959 --> 536.16
but it it had similarities to like a

533.92 --> 538.8
graveler character

536.16 --> 540.399
yes i know here we go guy adl is the

538.8 --> 542.3199999999999
anti-defamation league and they're

540.399 --> 544.72
always

542.32 --> 546.48
going after people that i don't know

544.72 --> 550.2
shame jews or something

546.48 --> 552.0
on the internet especially i'd call them

550.2 --> 555.12
anti-semites

552.0 --> 557.2
well they basically took this

555.12 --> 558.9590000000001
icon this image from the japanese

557.2 --> 562.0
culture which is part of their

558.959 --> 565.5999999999999
spiritual mythology and then

562.0 --> 569.04
said no this is a jew like

565.6 --> 571.44
the [Â __Â ] this is this is

569.04 --> 573.36
it's yeah anyway owen benjamin really

571.44 --> 577.839
funny

573.36 --> 577.839
always picking up on these things

577.92 --> 582.16
but yeah at the same time was it like i

581.04 --> 585.04
caught also

582.16 --> 586.0799999999999
through him no not directly but heard

585.04 --> 588.959
about it and saw

586.08 --> 590.64
infowars about like trump's farewell

588.959 --> 596.4799999999999
speech

590.64 --> 596.48
and it was just it had no spirit

596.88 --> 601.2
like he it just seemed like he was

599.519 --> 604.8
reading off a teleprompter and

601.2 --> 607.839
his heart was not in it

604.8 --> 609.12
anybody else pick up on that and just

607.839 --> 612.1600000000001
how he would thank

609.12 --> 616.079
pence and all that

612.16 --> 619.279
you know it just seems like

616.079 --> 623.04
he really chose to exit and he just

619.279 --> 626.16
made pants do it maybe

623.04 --> 626.7199999999999
that's what it made it me feel like how

626.16 --> 629.1999999999999
he said

626.72 --> 629.2
all that

630.399 --> 633.44
doesn't necessarily mean that it is

632.959 --> 637.1199999999999
might be

633.44 --> 637.7600000000001
accidentally like that but it just seems

637.12 --> 641.519
like

637.76 --> 641.519
trump is like really just

643.44 --> 647.839
fleeing the scene almost like

648.079 --> 655.1999999999999
yeah and then again

652.0 --> 657.6
there's the the infinite q hope that

655.2 --> 661.44
maybe there is some kind of

657.6 --> 664.64
secret move is

661.44 --> 665.2
son to warfare maneuver going on and

664.64 --> 667.279
that he's

665.2 --> 668.24
on purpose convincing everyone but then

667.279 --> 671.36
yeah that's

668.24 --> 671.92
just like infinite regressive spiral

671.36 --> 674.64
like

671.92 --> 675.68
if that's the case then only time will

674.64 --> 679.519
tell and there

675.68 --> 681.519
there's it's out it's going to be out of

679.519 --> 683.44
your hands

681.519 --> 685.36
everybody's hands most people's hands

683.44 --> 687.2
that are not involved in that secret

685.36 --> 702.8000000000001
maneuver so

687.2 --> 705.839
and it seems very unlikely at this point

702.8 --> 708.959
he was like that in a debate with biden

705.839 --> 709.9200000000001
i didn't see that he was in a debate

708.959 --> 716.6389999999999
with biden when

709.92 --> 719.279
that when did that happen talking about

716.639 --> 719.279
trump right

722.399 --> 726.48
yes oh yeah by the way hello [Â __Â ] was

728.839 --> 731.839
all

735.6 --> 740.639
presidential debate i i missed i missed

742.839 --> 745.839
that

749.68 --> 759.8389999999999
very weak

766.32 --> 771.36
yeah for me you know every time now that

769.519 --> 774.48
i think about it it just seems like he

771.36 --> 776.32
got he got in there

774.48 --> 778.48
he promised to drain the swamp but

776.32 --> 782.72
instead he just put his roots down

778.48 --> 786.16
in the swamp and now he's a swamp tree

782.72 --> 787.519
and the family tree sort of and so might

786.16 --> 789.92
not be the end of

787.519 --> 791.44
the trump family influence and such a

789.92 --> 794.4799999999999
thing

791.44 --> 797.6
but like this specific fight

794.48 --> 802.16
he's just stopping

797.6 --> 806.0
politically or like in the open

802.16 --> 809.6
it's just stepping back and that's it

806.0 --> 809.6
and you don't know what else is going to

812.839 --> 817.6
happen

814.639 --> 820.0790000000001
and yeah at the same time the democratic

817.6 --> 823.279
party apparatus and the media are going

820.079 --> 824.2399999999999
full nuts on everybody who who supported

823.279 --> 827.4399999999999
trump so

824.24 --> 831.12
at the same time like

827.44 --> 832.8800000000001
yeah no leadership well he's potentially

831.12 --> 834.9590000000001
what could unroll i don't know how it's

832.88 --> 836.8
going to transpire but

834.959 --> 839.5189999999999
if he's really just stepping away then

836.8 --> 842.16
he's leaving the trump supporters to

839.519 --> 845.68
just be a target and he's not helping

842.16 --> 845.68
them out and not protecting them

846.24 --> 853.519
that's like the most painful thing

849.279 --> 853.519
if that's actually gonna unroll like

854.839 --> 857.839
that

858.16 --> 862.24
because they they really put their bets

861.76 --> 865.04
on it

862.24 --> 865.92
gave it everything just were honest

865.04 --> 870.56
build up a good

865.92 --> 872.3199999999999
system of just doing things

870.56 --> 874.2399999999999
and the protesting and everything and

872.32 --> 877.1990000000001
just being very

874.24 --> 878.9590000000001
trying to fight for what they believe in

877.199 --> 882.88
in a sensible way

878.959 --> 885.92
as much as possible and now they're just

882.88 --> 889.12
yeah leaders just stepped away and

885.92 --> 891.12
now what are they gonna do because yeah

889.12 --> 892.5600000000001
it's even aggravating that they're being

891.12 --> 895.839
attacked for

892.56 --> 898.16
supporting somebody that literally just

895.839 --> 901.2790000000001
betrayed them

898.16 --> 906.3199999999999
like it is the most aggravating

901.279 --> 908.72
position i can imagine really

906.32 --> 910.9590000000001
like because you're being attacked for

908.72 --> 911.279
supporting somebody that just betrayed

910.959 --> 915.3599999999999
you

911.279 --> 927.8389999999999
and leaves you to get annihilated

915.36 --> 927.839
because of that it's unbelievable

928.959 --> 934.4799999999999
so yeah what is going to happen how is

930.8 --> 934.4799999999999
this going to unroll i don't know

937.6 --> 944.32
but also in ways

940.639 --> 945.6800000000001
like the media is just going to get

944.32 --> 948.32
they're going to do what they always do

945.68 --> 951.04
but i wonder now if like

948.32 --> 951.44
if if the biden administration is going

951.04 --> 954.0
to

951.44 --> 955.12
try to be a little sensible because the

954.0 --> 959.6
nerves are running

955.12 --> 961.68
so high in general i wonder

959.6 --> 962.9590000000001
if they would do that and surprise us

961.68 --> 965.4399999999999
all or

962.959 --> 967.68
maybe maybe that's too much of a hope

965.44 --> 972.5600000000001
and they're just going to

967.68 --> 983.3599999999999
full force ravage the situation

972.56 --> 985.5189999999999
i don't know

983.36 --> 987.6800000000001
someone suggested this children yeah

985.519 --> 990.8
that they're suggesting just

987.68 --> 990.8
insane things

992.399 --> 996.48
and owen benjamin also pointed out like

995.279 --> 998.56
yeah this is a

996.48 --> 1000.9590000000001
how they are behaving is exactly like a

998.56 --> 1003.68
communist regime

1000.959 --> 1005.68
just like like a soviet regime that's

1003.68 --> 1008.88
exactly how they're acting

1005.68 --> 1010.7199999999999
this group that's now being handed the

1008.88 --> 1013.6
reigns of power

1010.72 --> 1014.48
so that's what you expect and he's

1013.6 --> 1017.839
digging back

1014.48 --> 1019.9200000000001
into soviet comedy too to get a feel of

1017.839 --> 1022.72
it it's really fascinating because i

1019.92 --> 1024.48
when he was doing that in his show his

1022.72 --> 1026.4
upload show it just i

1024.48 --> 1028.319
immediately got that like he was

1026.4 --> 1030.16
traveling

1028.319 --> 1031.6789999999999
getting the feel of it that's what i do

1030.16 --> 1035.1200000000001
typically and so

1031.679 --> 1036.959
yeah i made some good points

1035.12 --> 1039.839
really opened my eyes in a couple of

1036.959 --> 1039.8390000000002
corners

1052.4 --> 1054.799
anyway

1055.93 --> 1061.3600000000001
[Music]

1057.12 --> 1061.36
it's it's not the end of it though

1062.32 --> 1067.84
it's just a downward movement

1068.4 --> 1077.679
then i feel a little guilty

1072.48 --> 1080.4
for being on another continent and just

1077.679 --> 1082.4
like i'll probably be relatively all

1080.4 --> 1086.0
right

1082.4 --> 1089.3600000000001
like nobody's bothered me for being

1086.0 --> 1090.799
sort of a trump supporter and not that

1089.36 --> 1093.36
i've just like uh

1090.799 --> 1095.039
advertised it or trump revolution talk

1093.36 --> 1097.84
or something

1095.039 --> 1099.84
but i've been every time i was asked

1097.84 --> 1102.9599999999998
it's like no no trump is

1099.84 --> 1102.9599999999998
trump is pretty cool

1105.28 --> 1109.84
but yeah can't say that anymore

1112.4 --> 1116.48
and he turned all gay and now he's

1115.36 --> 1121.12
giving up

1116.48 --> 1125.44
and yeah you know it was what it was

1121.12 --> 1125.4399999999998
at the time but it's not what it is now

1126.559 --> 1130.3999999999999
but yeah i'm going to be able to

1129.44 --> 1132.96
continue

1130.4 --> 1134.72
what i wanted to do with my life here

1132.96 --> 1138.08
trying to grow

1134.72 --> 1141.28
but at the same time yeah like i'm

1138.08 --> 1143.9189999999999
worried about what's happening across

1141.28 --> 1143.9189999999999
the ocean

1146.64 --> 1151.039
because i've yeah i forgot i've learned

1149.039 --> 1153.2
to have a great appreciation for the

1151.039 --> 1155.52
united states and the people especially

1153.2 --> 1155.52
in it

1156.16 --> 1159.919
some of them anyway but that yeah that's

1158.72 --> 1163.44
everywhere

1159.919 --> 1168.5590000000002
so it's bad and good and the more good

1163.44 --> 1168.559
the more bad usually also it's typical

1169.2 --> 1173.679
things balance themselves out like that

1174.16 --> 1180.24
but anyway it's also

1178.08 --> 1182.32
all the sensation and the worries it is

1180.24 --> 1185.44
really because of the moment

1182.32 --> 1190.32
you know because when the moments

1185.44 --> 1193.1200000000001
of change pass whatever it changes into

1190.32 --> 1194.32
you need that tension to go away and

1193.12 --> 1197.559
just start seeing

1194.32 --> 1199.039
what is actually happening now to

1197.559 --> 1202.48
re-evaluate like

1199.039 --> 1202.799
how it is going to be like that because

1202.48 --> 1204.84
it's

1202.799 --> 1206.32
of course a change from what was there

1204.84 --> 1209.4399999999998
before

1206.32 --> 1211.9189999999999
and to just see okay how much

1209.44 --> 1213.8400000000001
of their attitude was bluff or some kind

1211.919 --> 1217.679
of a tactic like what are they

1213.84 --> 1221.9189999999999
really going to do and

1217.679 --> 1224.799
can the strategies be identified as to

1221.919 --> 1226.0800000000002
what typical program book they're

1224.799 --> 1227.6
lending from like

1226.08 --> 1228.8799999999999
who are they going to act like are they

1227.6 --> 1231.28
going to act like obama are they going

1228.88 --> 1234.4
to act like

1231.28 --> 1237.12
like bill clinton or are they going to

1234.4 --> 1240.64
be like bush very very unlikely

1237.12 --> 1243.039
but yeah like so there's all these

1240.64 --> 1247.2800000000002
things that it

1243.039 --> 1249.2
it's just the tension and the drama

1247.28 --> 1251.44
of the moment i think most of it and

1249.2 --> 1251.8400000000001
that counts for myself as well because i

1251.44 --> 1253.76
am

1251.84 --> 1255.6
somewhat emotionally invested in the

1253.76 --> 1257.84
united states

1255.6 --> 1257.84
so

1259.039 --> 1267.36
even though i'm not even american

1262.799 --> 1269.52
just been on that ride for for a while

1267.36 --> 1271.9189999999999
and hey america was the thing that

1269.52 --> 1276.24
motivated me as a very young kid

1271.919 --> 1279.919
to learn english it really was

1276.24 --> 1279.919
and of course british too

1280.4 --> 1284.799
but american was easier for me to latch

1282.96 --> 1288.559
on to

1284.799 --> 1288.559
and yeah british is like

1288.799 --> 1293.12
was a little bit more difficult but it

1290.88 --> 1295.5200000000002
is definitely

1293.12 --> 1298.799
a part of it part of what i'm trying to

1295.52 --> 1298.799
learn and everything as well

1299.2 --> 1306.159
all right

1304.0 --> 1307.52
this is different than a normal

1306.159 --> 1319.8400000000001
transition of power

1307.52 --> 1319.84
okay can you elaborate robin stanley

1328.13 --> 1333.8400000000001
[Music]

1330.84 --> 1333.84
what

1338.48 --> 1343.679
okay here we go again so

1345.12 --> 1349.36
so trump went a little theatrical

1351.52 --> 1361.84
it's not surprising

1363.84 --> 1375.84
very little center politics right

1381.679 --> 1389.8400000000001
i don't know who roy cohn was

1385.28 --> 1389.84
here we go again i have no idea

1408.96 --> 1417.8400000000001
a mafia lawyer all right okay

1419.6 --> 1431.84
well trump says everybody's a genius

1421.84 --> 1431.84
that he employs so

1442.84 --> 1445.84
so

1448.88 --> 1453.7600000000002
what robin stanley what soul of the

1452.0 --> 1459.84
country is that some kind of song

1453.76 --> 1459.84
i don't know

1468.0 --> 1473.84
okay here we go again that's weird

1471.279 --> 1473.84
but whatever

1477.6 --> 1481.52
trump said you wasn't going was his

1480.64 --> 1487.039
mentor

1481.52 --> 1490.0
okay i wonder what he taught him

1487.039 --> 1493.44
he was probably just taking judicial

1490.0 --> 1493.44
advice from him though you know

1493.84 --> 1500.799
but whatever yeah trump's been

1497.039 --> 1504.96
hanging around with dubious people too

1500.799 --> 1504.96
it's all over he's been all over the map

1505.52 --> 1508.799
because i don't know he's a business guy

1507.6 --> 1515.84
that's

1508.799 --> 1515.84
to me it seems not too illogical

1520.559 --> 1526.6399999999999
it's a tag line of the left now oh jesus

1523.6 --> 1528.1589999999999
oh yeah well whatever they're gonna pump

1526.64 --> 1530.96
out it's gonna be atrocious

1528.159 --> 1530.96
and annoying

1534.88 --> 1538.4
like they are going to set the example

1537.84 --> 1542.3999999999999
for

1538.4 --> 1544.5590000000002
the winning left on how to squirt now

1542.4 --> 1546.159
so instead of like the last time when

1544.559 --> 1550.32
trump went and they all went

1546.159 --> 1552.96
no just catch me

1550.32 --> 1553.6789999999999
instead they're going to be like oh it's

1552.96 --> 1557.039
so

1553.679 --> 1559.1200000000001
oh we're winning and uh everybody's

1557.039 --> 1560.799
going to be gay now everybody's going to

1559.12 --> 1564.1589999999999
be

1560.799 --> 1566.8799999999999
like trans is superior and like the most

1564.159 --> 1569.44
naughty stupid things ever so yeah

1566.88 --> 1572.0800000000002
they're probably

1569.44 --> 1574.0800000000002
gonna be quite a nuisance to sit through

1572.08 --> 1575.84
and they're going to try to ruin more

1574.08 --> 1578.559
businesses

1575.84 --> 1582.0
make everybody act according to the

1578.559 --> 1582.0
program that is completely

1582.84 --> 1585.84
insane

1596.84 --> 1599.84
uh

1604.08 --> 1612.72
oh yeah trans health minister i right

1608.799 --> 1614.8799999999999
i noticed that i heard about that that's

1612.72 --> 1617.3600000000001
but when i read it i almost thought like

1614.88 --> 1619.3600000000001
nah like it's a joke

1617.36 --> 1621.6789999999999
but i forgot that it's actually real

1619.36 --> 1627.84
yeah i heard

1621.679 --> 1627.8400000000001
robin stanley what the

1638.86 --> 1648.649
[Music]

1652.84 --> 1658.7099999999998
so

1655.58 --> 1658.71
[Music]

1691.52 --> 1698.0
it's very annoying miss crazy ad please

1696.08 --> 1698.8799999999999
stop asking those annoying type of

1698.0 --> 1701.84
questions it's

1698.88 --> 1701.8400000000001
very annoying

1706.72 --> 1712.559
nobody's walking in my screen and never

1709.52 --> 1712.559
have never will

1714.24 --> 1719.279
unless i somehow get a girlfriend or

1717.039 --> 1722.84
something in some way

1719.279 --> 1724.48
that yeah while i'm in this living

1722.84 --> 1726.74
condition

1724.48 --> 1729.91
i highly doubt it

1726.74 --> 1729.91
[Music]

1730.48 --> 1733.279
on the other hand

1734.159 --> 1741.6000000000001
i might be doing financially better

1738.159 --> 1745.5200000000002
in the near future there's been some

1741.6 --> 1747.6789999999999
info from my dads on that part

1745.52 --> 1750.799
don't know just yet but it might be

1747.679 --> 1754.3990000000001
quite dramatic in ways

1750.799 --> 1757.9189999999999
as in that who knows where i will be

1754.399 --> 1757.9189999999999
in a few months financially

1757.93 --> 1763.8400000000001
[Music]

1761.039 --> 1766.24
might be doing really incredibly good

1763.84 --> 1769.52
all of a sudden

1766.24 --> 1771.36
as in like the bat that i had with the

1769.52 --> 1774.8799999999999
crypto situation might be

1771.36 --> 1778.1589999999999
paying off pretty dramatically soon

1774.88 --> 1781.44
but i don't know yet

1778.159 --> 1785.7600000000002
for all the hassle that it's also been

1781.44 --> 1785.76
it's definitely it's been worth it still

1786.08 --> 1791.76
because yeah everything

1790.0 --> 1794.0
from what i learned and i'm gonna be

1791.76 --> 1796.48
kind of meta

1794.0 --> 1797.679
the whole situation what i got into like

1796.48 --> 1801.2
it's anything

1797.679 --> 1805.679
but simple like on one part it

1801.2 --> 1810.159
the mechanic is kind of simple

1805.679 --> 1811.2
how it works but everything around it is

1810.159 --> 1813.919
a constant

1811.2 --> 1815.3600000000001
hassle and it's like yeah it really

1813.919 --> 1817.1200000000001
takes time to

1815.36 --> 1819.36
to work it all out it's almost like

1817.12 --> 1820.9599999999998
digital farming you have to do a lot of

1819.36 --> 1824.24
farming work there

1820.96 --> 1827.1200000000001
and that kind of annoyed me so i've been

1824.24 --> 1828.96
more staring at it from a distance le

1827.12 --> 1831.9189999999999
and now learning gradually

1828.96 --> 1832.32
a couple of things of how it works but

1831.919 --> 1836.0
it's

1832.32 --> 1838.8799999999999
anything but oh you buy the account

1836.0 --> 1841.2
or something however what you've been

1838.88 --> 1844.3200000000002
confronted with out there is

1841.2 --> 1844.88
and then you just click a button every

1844.32 --> 1851.84
week

1844.88 --> 1855.2
and that's it no

1851.84 --> 1856.9599999999998
yeah that's not like that at all

1855.2 --> 1858.799
there's constant development you have to

1856.96 --> 1861.76
stay in contact because

1858.799 --> 1862.96
you need to be informed about like how

1861.76 --> 1865.84
things are

1862.96 --> 1868.08
the whole thing is changing like the

1865.84 --> 1869.9189999999999
original foundations are there but

1868.08 --> 1871.4399999999998
there's all these kind of connections

1869.919 --> 1874.7990000000002
happening

1871.44 --> 1879.039
latch on programs to help you grow

1874.799 --> 1882.1589999999999
and it's

1879.039 --> 1884.72
big like and complicated to me

1882.159 --> 1886.96
for somebody like me but anyway yeah

1884.72 --> 1888.24
that's been happening and it seems like

1886.96 --> 1891.919
there may be

1888.24 --> 1893.44
yeah a crypto that's directly involved

1891.919 --> 1897.039
in what i'm doing

1893.44 --> 1900.24
that might be jumping up in price

1897.039 --> 1903.2
and hey like i

1900.24 --> 1904.72
got it like it's been nagging for a

1903.2 --> 1907.76
while because the prices were

1904.72 --> 1910.48
so low that it's like nothing

1907.76 --> 1911.12
when you actually trade it in well now

1910.48 --> 1914.08
that might

1911.12 --> 1914.08
suddenly change

1914.799 --> 1918.8799999999999
pretty dramatically anyway

1918.96 --> 1923.8400000000001
i'm not gonna get specific until i get

1921.76 --> 1927.679
some information and also

1923.84 --> 1932.1589999999999
like there has been in the past issues

1927.679 --> 1935.039
like wasn't allowed to advertise for it

1932.159 --> 1935.919
now i'm mentioning that i got something

1935.039 --> 1939.44
i don't get

1935.919 --> 1939.76
too specific i'm afraid to advertise it

1939.44 --> 1941.76
but

1939.76 --> 1949.84
who knows i might at some point just

1941.76 --> 1949.84
kind of like okay

1949.919 --> 1954.0800000000002
drawing more people if they want to

1954.159 --> 1956.96
i've tried

1960.0 --> 1963.36
anyway if you've been interested in this

1962.32 --> 1965.12
sort of thing

1963.36 --> 1966.9599999999998
when i mention it even though i don't

1965.12 --> 1969.12
get into specifics a lot

1966.96 --> 1970.3990000000001
there's crypto talkers out there that do

1969.12 --> 1974.08
that a lot

1970.399 --> 1975.36
more a lot more right if anybody has

1974.08 --> 1977.12
been interested

1975.36 --> 1979.519
now would be the time to approach me

1977.12 --> 1982.08
about it because

1979.519 --> 1984.64
yeah when that price jumps dramatically

1982.08 --> 1984.6399999999999
after that

1988.0 --> 1992.559
to buy into it is going to be more

1990.799 --> 1996.08
expensive

1992.559 --> 1998.399
so that's just it

1996.08 --> 1999.4399999999998
right but nice to see i got some

1998.399 --> 2004.2399999999998
perspective yes

1999.44 --> 2005.679
very nice for me too

2004.24 --> 2007.84
it's kind of what i've been waiting for

2005.679 --> 2009.919
and what has made me so damn

2007.84 --> 2011.279
impatient in the background also it's

2009.919 --> 2015.2
like ah

2011.279 --> 2018.88
i want it now now now because i wanted

2015.2 --> 2020.72
was like restless like

2018.88 --> 2023.3600000000001
sometimes i'm really restless and i'm

2020.72 --> 2024.72
like yeah i want to work in a garden

2023.36 --> 2027.6789999999999
right now

2024.72 --> 2031.039
and i want to make a ring with

2027.679 --> 2033.8400000000001
goldsmithing right now and like

2031.039 --> 2035.279
back in the day i had those things i had

2033.84 --> 2038.08
a little garden

2035.279 --> 2039.2
with my ex and i had my own goldsmithing

2038.08 --> 2042.32
room

2039.2 --> 2042.72
like now i didn't have those impulses as

2042.32 --> 2045.36
much

2042.72 --> 2046.3990000000001
back there because yeah i guess too much

2045.36 --> 2048.879
sex

2046.399 --> 2050.399
it does kind of tire you out and i did

2048.879 --> 2052.56
not have any

2050.399 --> 2053.44
bigger perspectives on where i'm i was

2052.56 --> 2055.2799999999997
going

2053.44 --> 2057.28
still a lot of things about myself that

2055.28 --> 2060.3990000000003
i just didn't know what to do with

2057.28 --> 2063.52
i know still have some of those parts

2060.399 --> 2067.1189999999997
but i've grown a lot better at it

2063.52 --> 2069.679
got more confidence too like despite

2067.119 --> 2070.56
having a really beautiful girlfriend i

2069.679 --> 2074.56
did not have

2070.56 --> 2078.159
and that did not have as much confidence

2074.56 --> 2078.159
as i probably should have

2078.72 --> 2082.0789999999997
right yes gardening look i've always

2080.72 --> 2085.2
loved

2082.079 --> 2087.679
working in a garden and plants although

2085.2 --> 2089.359
not when it's really shitty weather but

2087.679 --> 2092.7200000000003
like especially just during

2089.359 --> 2093.919
sunny sunnier times i really appreciate

2092.72 --> 2096.6389999999997
doing that a lot

2093.919 --> 2098.72
it's like good to have something to busy

2096.639 --> 2100.839
yourself with in order to keep yourself

2098.72 --> 2104.64
outside

2100.839 --> 2106.7999999999997
almost and not just sit outside and

2104.64 --> 2108.56
be complaining about how your screen

2106.8 --> 2110.48
doesn't work as well

2108.56 --> 2112.72
when there's sunlight around that sort

2110.48 --> 2115.359
of thing right

2112.72 --> 2117.1189999999997
it's just people constantly like taking

2115.359 --> 2117.7599999999998
their mobiles or their laptops

2117.119 --> 2119.44
everywhere

2117.76 --> 2122.2400000000002
yeah it's like nice outside but you're

2119.44 --> 2124.16
still looking in the screen

2122.24 --> 2126.64
i don't want to do that and having

2124.16 --> 2130.64
garden things

2126.64 --> 2133.04
really helps you stay out of that

2130.64 --> 2134.16
and an art studio well goldsmithing

2133.04 --> 2138.32
studio

2134.16 --> 2141.04
never had much of an art studio

2138.32 --> 2142.839
like i always sketch on paper when i do

2141.04 --> 2145.119
something it's more like a designing

2142.839 --> 2147.599
sketch

2145.119 --> 2148.32
more mechanical i've never had like

2147.599 --> 2151.92
painting

2148.32 --> 2151.92
art gallery situations

2155.2 --> 2158.3999999999996
i tried some of that in my teen times it

2158.0 --> 2161.119
was

2158.4 --> 2162.4
interesting there's something about

2161.119 --> 2166.32
painting

2162.4 --> 2170.64
it it unnerves me

2166.32 --> 2174.48
to do it and i've never really

2170.64 --> 2174.48
managed to complete a project

2175.92 --> 2182.16
that i was like it was never good enough

2179.599 --> 2182.7200000000003
what came out like only when i did

2182.16 --> 2184.8799999999997
really

2182.72 --> 2186.0
simplistic things would i be able to

2184.88 --> 2188.0
complete it to my

2186.0 --> 2190.32
satisfaction and then it's like yeah

2188.0 --> 2191.28
it's not really that special it's pretty

2190.32 --> 2194.88
okay it's

2191.28 --> 2197.8390000000004
hard but i've had

2194.88 --> 2199.44
just some amazing visionary things that

2197.839 --> 2203.2799999999997
i tried to put down

2199.44 --> 2206.2400000000002
through through painting

2203.28 --> 2208.079
and sketching even and it just wouldn't

2206.24 --> 2211.04
come out

2208.079 --> 2213.119
not like bits of it and then it would

2211.04 --> 2214.079
just transmute into something else and

2213.119 --> 2216.8
it happened every time

2214.079 --> 2216.8
and it just i

2218.88 --> 2223.76
i don't know what it is with me painting

2221.52 --> 2223.7599999999998
just

2224.32 --> 2229.839
maybe it's not the time yet or something

2230.24 --> 2233.839
but i've also been just a lot of

2232.079 --> 2243.2000000000003
distracted towards

2233.839 --> 2245.44
computers computer art

2243.2 --> 2248.24
if you build that environment you will

2245.44 --> 2248.2400000000002
thrive with it

2254.839 --> 2257.839
maybe

2264.56 --> 2268.16
i don't know maybe for me being in a

2267.599 --> 2270.4
group

2268.16 --> 2273.44
and just getting an order to do

2270.4 --> 2276.7200000000003
something might work better

2273.44 --> 2276.7200000000003
sounds really weird right

2278.32 --> 2284.32
but like in school doing art

2281.76 --> 2286.4
it's like okay you get a certain task

2284.32 --> 2290.32
i've always been

2286.4 --> 2292.96
much better at that because then my mind

2290.32 --> 2294.2400000000002
is adapting to the order and then can do

2292.96 --> 2296.32
its magic

2294.24 --> 2298.3199999999997
i don't have to be concerned about

2296.32 --> 2300.56
manifesting and i don't know what it is

2298.32 --> 2300.56
yet

2305.52 --> 2310.64
because i got guidelines and if i i've

2308.64 --> 2312.24
never been successful at really giving

2310.64 --> 2315.1189999999997
myself guidelines

2312.24 --> 2315.5989999999997
like ordering myself like you're going

2315.119 --> 2318.8
to do

2315.599 --> 2322.56
this you're going to do it like this

2318.8 --> 2324.5600000000004
because as i go it just loses cohesion

2322.56 --> 2325.599
well if it's going to be checked

2324.56 --> 2328.0
afterward

2325.599 --> 2330.079
to conform by the other person that

2328.0 --> 2334.56
doesn't go through all these

2330.079 --> 2334.5600000000004
changes during the process then

2336.079 --> 2341.8390000000004
yeah then it keeps me in check during

2338.48 --> 2341.839
the process

2343.76 --> 2346.2400000000002
anyway

2347.599 --> 2351.04
today i'm looking at a new living

2349.359 --> 2354.56
situation more creative environment

2351.04 --> 2356.56
that's awesome

2354.56 --> 2360.0
yeah i'm glad you're doing a good robin

2356.56 --> 2363.2
stanley it's for good to hear

2360.0 --> 2366.88
but anyway for me for me much more

2363.2 --> 2370.0789999999997
much better has always been goldsmithing

2366.88 --> 2371.6800000000003
because it's pretty easy to make

2370.079 --> 2372.2400000000002
something and then you got something

2371.68 --> 2374.8799999999997
solid

2372.24 --> 2376.52
and it really imp like there's a lot of

2374.88 --> 2382.1600000000003
people that can draw and do

2376.52 --> 2384.0
absolutely astounding things with it

2382.16 --> 2386.3999999999996
but when it comes to just physical

2384.0 --> 2388.0
objects it's different it's a different

2386.4 --> 2391.359
scale and to me

2388.0 --> 2396.16
it's kind of easy like i'm very

2391.359 --> 2398.96
confident and i've tried a lot

2396.16 --> 2399.44
made some pretty cool things i think i

2398.96 --> 2403.14
shared

2399.44 --> 2404.56
a lot of it right

2403.14 --> 2406.48
[Music]

2404.56 --> 2407.599
and i got all the equipment i still got

2406.48 --> 2409.52
it in storage and

2407.599 --> 2410.8
my dad has some of it because he's also

2409.52 --> 2413.2
been dabbling in it

2410.8 --> 2413.2000000000003
a little

2416.4 --> 2422.64
right so anyway i'm

2419.68 --> 2424.24
dreaming a little now of potentially

2422.64 --> 2427.1189999999997
getting there

2424.24 --> 2427.1189999999997
thing that i wanted

2427.599 --> 2431.119
but i think that if i'm going to get

2429.52 --> 2434.8
some kind of

2431.119 --> 2435.76
money out yeah money rolling my way it's

2434.8 --> 2439.52
first going

2435.76 --> 2442.3190000000004
it's going to be just getting new pants

2439.52 --> 2444.88
sounds so funny saying that because i

2442.319 --> 2447.52
just like pants that

2444.88 --> 2449.04
that don't have holes in them everywhere

2447.52 --> 2451.68
and these pants have been like

2449.04 --> 2453.52
amazing magical almost like how long

2451.68 --> 2456.48
they've lasted

2453.52 --> 2456.48
and i can still

2456.8 --> 2464.4
get around with it just really neat

2461.04 --> 2464.4
new clothes new jacket

2465.28 --> 2471.0400000000004
because repairing only gets you so far

2471.44 --> 2481.839
kick it down what

2498.13 --> 2505.27
[Music]

2505.52 --> 2512.48
oh right i didn't know that one

2508.88 --> 2514.56
go for it sure

2512.48 --> 2516.4
well we'll see where it goes it's too

2514.56 --> 2518.72
bad that if once i

2516.4 --> 2519.92
finally go and do something like that

2518.72 --> 2523.839
it's going to be in

2519.92 --> 2523.839
like a masked world

2524.16 --> 2537.839
that's a bit of a bummer

2548.839 --> 2551.839
what

2562.839 --> 2565.839
do

2576.839 --> 2592.0789999999997
so

2579.359 --> 2596.16
big proponent of confident dressing

2592.079 --> 2597.6800000000003
for me yeah i'm a proponent of it too

2596.16 --> 2600.56
but

2597.68 --> 2601.04
to me i really find it difficult to make

2600.56 --> 2603.52
out

2601.04 --> 2604.16
like what something is like what kind of

2603.52 --> 2606.96
impression

2604.16 --> 2610.0789999999997
it i got this blind spot when it

2606.96 --> 2613.119
concerns myself like that

2610.079 --> 2616.6400000000003
so i've been kind of like a very

2613.119 --> 2620.48
monotonous dresser but i have it

2616.64 --> 2622.7999999999997
hey you guys never noticed that right

2620.48 --> 2623.839
because i never look the same on any

2622.8 --> 2626.5600000000004
show

2623.839 --> 2628.24
oh wait yeah no i look exactly the same

2626.56 --> 2631.2799999999997
every single freaking show since the

2628.24 --> 2635.2
first one yeah i know

2631.28 --> 2635.2000000000003
except for when it's summer and hot

2637.92 --> 2643.359
don't change that i agree i'm satisfied

2641.28 --> 2645.8390000000004
like over the time seeing how people

2643.359 --> 2648.96
react i'm kind of satisfied

2645.839 --> 2652.16
it's just a little weird

2648.96 --> 2652.16
to me so

2653.359 --> 2657.04
reality is just weird let's just say it

2655.839 --> 2660.64
like that reality

2657.04 --> 2666.0
is just weird to me and it's just gonna

2660.64 --> 2669.52
be good having to refresh my inventory

2666.0 --> 2677.839
the things that i wear and then we'll

2669.52 --> 2677.839
see where to go from there

2689.44 --> 2695.52
all right okay so you're talking about

2692.48 --> 2696.56
here we go ken brought up succession and

2695.52 --> 2699.44
the civil war

2696.56 --> 2699.44
north and south

2700.56 --> 2705.839
getting getting a little complicated

2732.319 --> 2747.839
right yeah more color now i got that

2760.0 --> 2767.599
right yeah here we go again you look

2764.96 --> 2769.68
technically i think states can succeed

2767.599 --> 2772.839
within the constitution

2769.68 --> 2774.0
it's just step away but the problem is

2772.839 --> 2775.7599999999998
that

2774.0 --> 2778.64
that's not going to be without

2775.76 --> 2778.6400000000003
consequences

2778.72 --> 2782.3999999999996
you know stepping away doesn't mean

2782.64 --> 2788.48
it's guaranteed stepping away peacefully

2786.24 --> 2790.4799999999996
because there's a lot of interests that

2788.48 --> 2803.839
are going to be broken and all that

2790.48 --> 2803.839
you know it's a huge hassle

2821.359 --> 2825.839
right well maybe the united states will

2824.24 --> 2829.359
kind of split up into

2825.839 --> 2831.2
two types of territory

2829.359 --> 2833.359
i don't know territories the proper

2831.2 --> 2836.64
terminology for that but

2833.359 --> 2839.2799999999997
maybe it will become a do a duopoly

2836.64 --> 2839.2799999999997
society

3050.319 --> 3053.359
yeah i just looked through that

3051.52 --> 3056.0
wikipedia link there

3053.359 --> 3056.0
more colored

3056.88 --> 3069.839

3141.28 --> 3143.52
no

3144.4 --> 3149.359
here we go again uh look i've seen it go

3148.16 --> 3152.0
around

3149.359 --> 3152.7999999999997
constantly it's just that i don't want

3152.0 --> 3155.119
that

3152.8 --> 3155.119
stuff

3156.4 --> 3160.079
i i might have seen it it's just that

3158.72 --> 3163.7599999999998
yeah i get it

3160.079 --> 3165.76
i don't need to see that

3163.76 --> 3166.88
it's like oh yeah if you kill somebody

3165.76 --> 3169.0400000000004
they die

3166.88 --> 3172.0
let me show you a thousand of those

3169.04 --> 3172.0
freaking videos

3174.8 --> 3180.559
i know i know that happens i don't need

3178.319 --> 3181.68
to see that in order to be convinced not

3180.559 --> 3184.3190000000004
to do it

3181.68 --> 3184.319
you get it

3185.839 --> 3189.119
it's we're being bombarded with that

3188.0 --> 3190.96
sort of stuff

3189.119 --> 3192.96
because there is a lot of it and i guess

3190.96 --> 3196.319
it's needed for some people

3192.96 --> 3198.96
that are really hat strong but for me

3196.319 --> 3198.96
it's just

3203.359 --> 3209.839
it just makes me sick that's it

3214.13 --> 3217.309
[Music]

3227.44 --> 3233.2000000000003
right now all the law

3231.04 --> 3234.5589999999997
stuff that you guys were talking about

3233.2 --> 3237.04
in chat

3234.559 --> 3238.079
problem is i i don't know the details of

3237.04 --> 3241.599
that

3238.079 --> 3242.8
it's very elaborate and i have ideas

3241.599 --> 3244.6400000000003
about it but they're all

3242.8 --> 3246.0
very rough and they're not really going

3244.64 --> 3249.2
to help

3246.0 --> 3251.76
me basically guessing how it works

3249.2 --> 3254.0
because from my rough estimation how i

3251.76 --> 3256.4
understood is that taxes is typically

3254.0 --> 3257.599
like a potential secession state and

3256.4 --> 3259.28
it's even worked into

3257.599 --> 3261.92
everything it's like okay things really

3259.28 --> 3265.0400000000004
go wrong you go to texas

3261.92 --> 3266.88
because it becomes like its own thing i

3265.04 --> 3269.44
don't know how much of that is still

3266.88 --> 3269.44
left though

3270.48 --> 3279.839
if it still works like that

3322.0 --> 3327.68
it's important info well

3325.44 --> 3330.079
look do you really think that like

3327.68 --> 3332.839
vaccination believers are

3330.079 --> 3335.8390000000004
going to generally hang around my

3332.839 --> 3335.839
hangout

3354.319 --> 3362.5589999999997
yeah because i think that like

3359.04 --> 3366.319
knowing about vaccination is

3362.559 --> 3368.96
lower threshold than say flat flat earth

3366.319 --> 3370.0
it's at this point getting so high up

3368.96 --> 3374.16
it's almost like

3370.0 --> 3374.16
moon level moon landing level

3374.319 --> 3382.24
like you gotta know something is wrong

3377.68 --> 3382.24
and the people that that would

3382.4 --> 3388.1600000000003
would still hold on to it like they're

3385.119 --> 3390.88
not going to be flat earthers

3388.16 --> 3391.359
you've got to realize that so they'll

3390.88 --> 3393.92
never

3391.359 --> 3393.92
see this

3399.28 --> 3403.119
like this hangout that that's kind of

3401.119 --> 3406.079
how i'm reasoning it out

3403.119 --> 3408.7200000000003
i guess in that sense i don't have the

3406.079 --> 3411.119
best of setups

3408.72 --> 3412.319
because yeah flat earth it's it's good

3411.119 --> 3414.48
to have that freedom

3412.319 --> 3414.48
but

3415.52 --> 3420.559
like where we're on the level where all

3418.0 --> 3424.0
of this information is quite apparent

3420.559 --> 3426.799
like we don't have trouble

3424.0 --> 3426.799
looking through that

3428.88 --> 3436.1600000000003
what people that typically

3433.28 --> 3437.119
yeah would probably would shy away from

3436.16 --> 3440.72
flat earth

3437.119 --> 3440.7200000000003
related things anyway

3442.559 --> 3448.0
because then they'd get yeah they get

3445.52 --> 3450.48
super conflicted about their vaccination

3448.0 --> 3450.48
beliefs

3450.96 --> 3461.839
and some people really hold on to that

3472.839 --> 3478.5589999999997
uh

3475.52 --> 3481.52
right but it's not that i don't mind

3478.559 --> 3489.8390000000004
you guys just exchanging information

3481.52 --> 3489.839
like that by the way in my chat

3490.48 --> 3497.04
but yeah like for me

3494.48 --> 3498.96
it's it's like out of my interest though

3497.04 --> 3500.079
now because it's become so blatant

3498.96 --> 3502.799
there's just nothing

3500.079 --> 3504.7200000000003
left for me to say like if you don't

3502.799 --> 3507.04
know it yet then

3504.72 --> 3511.1189999999997
i won't be able to convince you or it's

3507.04 --> 3511.119
it's literally not even worth it anymore

3515.04 --> 3519.44
that's in a way how i feel like okay

3517.599 --> 3519.9900000000002
when the curtains removed and you're

3519.44 --> 3521.2000000000003
still

3519.99 --> 3531.839
[Music]

3521.2 --> 3531.839
going with it that's on you

3538.48 --> 3542.96
and and that's why i keep on also

3541.44 --> 3545.44
expressing

3542.96 --> 3547.92
the stand the standpoint the attitude

3545.44 --> 3551.92
the position

3547.92 --> 3556.0
of just like the soul that's so nice

3551.92 --> 3559.28
but you cannot force me to get a vaccine

3556.0 --> 3561.839
because then like that will go

3559.28 --> 3563.119
over certain thresholds that this just

3561.839 --> 3566.319
not gonna happen

3563.119 --> 3568.7200000000003
without some major major backlash

3566.319 --> 3570.079
and i vow to that even on the personal

3568.72 --> 3573.52
scale

3570.079 --> 3576.1600000000003
because i will take it as violence

3573.52 --> 3577.359
with deadly threat and then respond

3576.16 --> 3580.7999999999997
accordingly

3577.359 --> 3582.16
right but other than that

3580.8 --> 3583.76
[Music]

3582.16 --> 3585.92
i don't think they're even going to

3583.76 --> 3588.559
force it they're just going to make it

3585.92 --> 3588.559
very

3589.28 --> 3595.92
like they'll hang the dream over you

3593.44 --> 3598.16
that if you take it all this [Â __Â ] is

3595.92 --> 3601.2000000000003
going to go away all the

3598.16 --> 3603.2
all the obstructions so that it's just a

3601.2 --> 3604.3999999999996
seduction thing and i'm not going to be

3603.2 --> 3609.2
seduced at all

3604.4 --> 3609.2000000000003
ever systematically not

3611.76 --> 3616.0
but people that are yeah that's that's

3614.72 --> 3617.7599999999998
calling

3616.0 --> 3620.24
that's called god's calling that's

3617.76 --> 3622.7200000000003
called kind of selling out to the devil

3620.24 --> 3624.8799999999997
in a way it's like

3622.72 --> 3627.1189999999997
you don't want to bear it anymore so you

3624.88 --> 3629.839
forget about it and you go in

3627.119 --> 3629.839
into it

3632.4 --> 3636.319
if you yeah if you're on that road then

3634.48 --> 3638.48
there's literally nothing i can do for

3636.319 --> 3638.48
you

3639.839 --> 3644.24
if you don't want to learn if you don't

3642.0 --> 3647.52
want to bear the burden then

3644.24 --> 3649.7599999999998
yeah i can't make you

3647.52 --> 3652.96
can't make you understand i can't make

3649.76 --> 3652.96
you take the hint

3655.44 --> 3661.2000000000003
you know it's tragic but maybe there is

3659.04 --> 3662.72
some kind of weird karmic justice to it

3661.2 --> 3665.04
it's like yeah okay if you

3662.72 --> 3667.7599999999998
insist on making that mistake even with

3665.04 --> 3671.839
all the warning signals and everywhere

3667.76 --> 3671.8390000000004
then you must pay the price

3672.4 --> 3679.359
because you insist on it you forced

3675.44 --> 3685.839
the situation with your ignorance and

3679.359 --> 3685.839
your dedication

[Music]

3716.88 --> 3722.6400000000003
right well mark collard look vaccines

3719.359 --> 3722.64
the original workings

3724.0 --> 3729.039
as far as i know there are no

3727.039 --> 3731.6800000000003
effective vaccines that have ever been

3729.039 --> 3735.2000000000003
created against viruses

3731.68 --> 3736.24
because well guess why because viruses

3735.2 --> 3738.3999999999996
don't exist

3736.24 --> 3741.5989999999997
there's something else doesn't work that

3738.4 --> 3743.44
way but with bacterial situations as far

3741.599 --> 3746.96
as i know

3743.44 --> 3750.4
there have been like it can

3746.96 --> 3753.76
work if the conditions are

3750.4 --> 3755.839
right and it's done properly but when it

3753.76 --> 3759.119
comes to viruses it's just

3755.839 --> 3759.119
it can't work

3759.44 --> 3763.92
or if they're they're going by a premise

3762.96 --> 3766.7200000000003
of a belief

3763.92 --> 3768.319
that is doesn't exist like viruses don't

3766.72 --> 3771.4399999999996
work that way

3768.319 --> 3773.119
they're not viruses in that sense but

3771.44 --> 3775.28
they might be trying to fight

3773.119 --> 3778.7200000000003
the general associated symptoms in

3775.28 --> 3781.52
another fashion through another mechanic

3778.72 --> 3783.7599999999998
that we or the virus believers don't

3781.52 --> 3786.16
have oversight over

3783.76 --> 3788.96
they don't know exactly because they are

3786.16 --> 3792.16
not been given the model of approach

3788.96 --> 3794.4
for that what

3792.16 --> 3796.16
the vaccine makers are actually trying

3794.4 --> 3798.799
to achieve

3796.16 --> 3799.92
how they're supposedly trying to bypass

3798.799 --> 3802.4
that problem or

3799.92 --> 3803.039
solve it right they're just not telling

3802.4 --> 3804.96
you

3803.039 --> 3807.2000000000003
in this case with these vaccines it's

3804.96 --> 3809.28
it's just complete it's just a random

3807.2 --> 3811.7599999999998
experiment

3809.28 --> 3813.119
it's not even when you look into it like

3811.76 --> 3815.2000000000003
on the surface it says

3813.119 --> 3816.88
it says like yeah this is this helps

3815.2 --> 3818.3999999999996
prevent it or this stops it

3816.88 --> 3820.559
then you look at it no it doesn't help

3818.4 --> 3823.2000000000003
prevent doesn't help stop it

3820.559 --> 3824.4
and it does random [Â __Â ] to you we don't

3823.2 --> 3828.72
exactly even know the

3824.4 --> 3828.7200000000003
the entire outcome so

3833.2 --> 3838.3999999999996
i don't know man

3836.24 --> 3839.7599999999998
like it has nothing is this is not a

3838.4 --> 3841.92
vaccine

3839.76 --> 3842.96
it's not it has nothing to do with the

3841.92 --> 3846.079
concept

3842.96 --> 3848.4
of a vaccine at this point

3846.079 --> 3850.079
just doesn't have anything to do with it

3848.4 --> 3853.28
it's not vaccination

3850.079 --> 3856.96
it's just a weird medical experiment

3853.28 --> 3860.48
get it it's not a vaccination

3856.96 --> 3864.839
it's just a medical experiment

3860.48 --> 3867.839
and they're not telling you do you

3864.839 --> 3867.839
understand

3885.68 --> 3895.839
all right

3902.559 --> 3906.4
yeah because look when it comes to like

3905.119 --> 3908.88
medical

3906.4 --> 3910.48
care and disease prevention and all that

3908.88 --> 3911.44
i would have completely different

3910.48 --> 3913.44
approaches

3911.44 --> 3914.799
i would have more of a terrain theory

3913.44 --> 3916.96
approach

3914.799 --> 3918.88
and kind of like okay breast milk very

3916.96 --> 3923.359
important one way or the other

3918.88 --> 3926.079
very important that would be number one

3923.359 --> 3928.24
and secondary like at a certain age

3926.079 --> 3932.799
they're gonna have to just

3928.24 --> 3932.799
go out and get dirty in the forest

3934.24 --> 3939.52
and yeah and then have the right

3936.88 --> 3943.28
nutrients and everything available

3939.52 --> 3946.16
and that is going to be their vaccine

3943.28 --> 3947.6800000000003
and in a way my mother also gave me that

3946.16 --> 3950.319
treatment

3947.68 --> 3951.1189999999997
although i did also take a couple of

3950.319 --> 3953.839
vaccines

3951.119 --> 3955.52
just super basic like two or something

3953.839 --> 3958.24
that's it

3955.52 --> 3959.68
and it was annoying because as a kid i

3958.24 --> 3964.72
believed in them

3959.68 --> 3968.24
i believed that my parents had to like

3964.72 --> 3970.3999999999996
they they couldn't they

3968.24 --> 3972.72
didn't dare or they couldn't counter me

3970.4 --> 3974.799
they couldn't tell me it's bad

3972.72 --> 3976.319
they didn't maybe they believed in it

3974.799 --> 3980.0
too but they were scared

3976.319 --> 3980.319
it was but i yeah i really believed in

3980.0 --> 3983.359
them

3980.319 --> 3985.92
like i asked for it sometimes

3983.359 --> 3987.7599999999998
and now scares the [Â __Â ] out of me just

3985.92 --> 3989.839
realizing that as a kid i was just like

3987.76 --> 3991.44
oh yeah no i want to get the vaccine i

3989.839 --> 3992.0
want to get the medical improve because

3991.44 --> 3995.359
i freaking

3992.0 --> 3996.0
believed in it it's crazy now thank god

3995.359 --> 3999.92
i didn't

3996.0 --> 4007.839
get it this is despite my stupid

3999.92 --> 4007.839
willingness you see

4013.28 --> 4018.8390000000004
because i really believed in vaccines

4015.68 --> 4021.2799999999997
and i believe that it was all clean all

4018.839 --> 4023.7599999999998
good

4021.28 --> 4026.0
because i just like i couldn't imagine

4023.76 --> 4026.0
like

4026.559 --> 4032.2400000000002
that it would be not good

4029.839 --> 4034.16
or that people like doctors could be

4032.24 --> 4037.52
even in a situation where they

4034.16 --> 4040.319
believed that two didn't know it or saw

4037.52 --> 4042.319
bad results but just couldn't accept it

4040.319 --> 4044.24
just didn't understand what is going i

4042.319 --> 4046.319
could not imagine that

4044.24 --> 4047.2799999999997
back in the day i was just like no

4046.319 --> 4050.0
everybody is

4047.28 --> 4051.6800000000003
exactly as they're supposed to be

4050.0 --> 4054.799
they're on top of things

4051.68 --> 4056.319
just i everybody had to be on top of

4054.799 --> 4057.7599999999998
things i couldn't imagine that they

4056.319 --> 4063.839
wouldn't be

4057.76 --> 4063.8390000000004
as a kid

4079.52 --> 4086.16
right but my immune strategy would be

4083.92 --> 4089.28
for little kids is like make sure they

4086.16 --> 4091.1189999999997
get breast fed

4089.28 --> 4093.76
hopefully through the mother but hey

4091.119 --> 4097.12
even if they have problems or something

4093.76 --> 4101.6
then get another mother keep fine

4097.12 --> 4104.08
find the real thing and then

4101.6 --> 4105.839
yeah at a certain age get them dirty get

4104.08 --> 4110.4
them in the dirt

4105.839 --> 4112.5599999999995
make sure they don't get over sanitized

4110.4 --> 4113.839
like of course they can't be yeah don't

4112.56 --> 4115.4400000000005
let them roll around and [Â __Â ]

4113.839 --> 4117.2789999999995
like they got to be clean to a certain

4115.44 --> 4121.12
level of course

4117.279 --> 4124.400000000001
but don't try to immunize

4121.12 --> 4124.88
them from bacteria or something it's

4124.4 --> 4127.04
good

4124.88 --> 4129.4400000000005
for a kid to be dirty they become very

4127.04 --> 4132.64
strong

4129.44 --> 4135.919999999999
if they're not overly kept clean

4132.64 --> 4135.92
over sanitized right

4136.319 --> 4139.4400000000005
and i was dirty as [Â __Â ] no i'm not

4138.56 --> 4143.759
literal [Â __Â ]

4139.44 --> 4143.759
i was really disgusted by [Â __Â ] as a kid

4144.159 --> 4150.0
but man a dirt oh yeah

4147.679 --> 4151.279
i would literally just roll around and

4150.0 --> 4154.239
stuff

4151.279 --> 4157.679
i was almost like a dog sometimes as a

4154.239 --> 4157.678999999999
really little kid it's just like

4174.56 --> 4179.120000000001
you know what also is weird is that i

4176.4 --> 4179.12
remember that

4179.759 --> 4183.839
like gmo when that first came on the

4182.64 --> 4188.4800000000005
scene

4183.839 --> 4191.04
like through media also and

4188.48 --> 4191.839
like i think that we actually ate gmo

4191.04 --> 4194.32
one time

4191.839 --> 4196.48
to try it out was literally like let's

4194.32 --> 4199.759999999999
try it out what it is

4196.48 --> 4203.839999999999
and it wasn't great

4199.76 --> 4203.84
i think i even became sick from it

4206.0 --> 4209.84
it was weird just remembering that we

4209.199 --> 4212.159
actually

4209.84 --> 4217.84
like like we really kind of officially

4212.159 --> 4217.839999999999
tried we didn't know

4217.92 --> 4222.4
we didn't know like if it was bad now

4220.4 --> 4223.36
this is still like the earlier version

4222.4 --> 4226.879999999999
this

4223.36 --> 4226.88
pre-crisper time

4227.44 --> 4230.799999999999
so it was like food gun like the

4230.08 --> 4233.84
genetics

4230.8 --> 4237.52
gun type of gmo

4233.84 --> 4239.4400000000005
we had no idea we had no idea

4237.52 --> 4242.159000000001
what we were engaging at and i think a

4239.44 --> 4243.5199999999995
lot of people back then didn't know

4242.159 --> 4246.239
they just didn't know what they were

4243.52 --> 4246.2390000000005
doing with that

4250.32 --> 4257.44
so no gmo grain though thank god

4253.679 --> 4259.84
i think it was tomatoes i tried tomatoes

4257.44 --> 4259.839999999999
or

4264.32 --> 4268.5599999999995
yeah more in that type of direction

4266.32 --> 4269.28
tomatoes maybe paprikas or something i

4268.56 --> 4271.76
don't remember

4269.28 --> 4272.48
exactly what definitely the tomatoes

4271.76 --> 4276.0
though

4272.48 --> 4276.0
but yeah

4276.239 --> 4287.839999999999
it did it it didn't really work out

4290.719 --> 4297.44
was it corn i think we yeah i think we

4294.159 --> 4297.44
tried gmo corn

4298.719 --> 4302.64
right but did this was i think in the

4300.96 --> 4305.679
90s

4302.64 --> 4307.76
ugh but i'm glad that we got over that

4305.679 --> 4310.88
quickly and at a certain point

4307.76 --> 4314.0
we all got organic

4310.88 --> 4315.679
or at least like not like

4314.0 --> 4317.6
label organic i don't even know if it

4315.679 --> 4320.64
was already there yet

4317.6 --> 4324.64
but just keep it

4320.64 --> 4326.56
clean at natural no pesticide

4324.64 --> 4329.84
that sort of thing and then later the

4326.56 --> 4329.84
organic brand arrived

4330.56 --> 4338.56
but yeah that was like at the end period

4334.96 --> 4343.84
like before the family scattered

4338.56 --> 4343.84
and my mother died

4345.04 --> 4349.04
all right early two thousand

4350.8 --> 4357.84
not two thousand but anyway

4359.36 --> 4363.759999999999
yeah so my program the approach of how i

4362.96 --> 4366.4800000000005
would do it

4363.76 --> 4366.8
is pretty simple pretty old-fashioned

4366.48 --> 4369.678999999999
but

4366.8 --> 4371.4400000000005
well thought through it's like no it's

4369.679 --> 4373.76
old-fashioned not because i

4371.44 --> 4377.36
am just holding on to one thing and

4373.76 --> 4379.52
ignoring everything else no it's just

4377.36 --> 4381.92
these old-fashioned things turned out to

4379.52 --> 4385.040000000001
be quite

4381.92 --> 4387.1990000000005
accurate and effective and it's like the

4385.04 --> 4388.96
more we learn and the more the internet

4387.199 --> 4392.159
reveals a lot

4388.96 --> 4399.84
the more we learn why they're effective

4392.159 --> 4399.839999999999
isn't that just brilliant

4404.4 --> 4413.839999999999
organic whole milk

4414.239 --> 4419.678999999999
or if i would get kids if

4417.679 --> 4420.8
if i find the opportunity and have

4419.679 --> 4422.96
children

4420.8 --> 4424.0
definitely of course breast milk but it

4422.96 --> 4426.4800000000005
would be good to

4424.0 --> 4428.96
figure out if we could get raw milk

4426.48 --> 4428.959999999999
somewhere

4430.08 --> 4434.719
like in that certain period like in the

4432.719 --> 4437.679
pre-teens

4434.719 --> 4438.96
to get raw milk and not because i we

4437.679 --> 4441.36
didn't know that

4438.96 --> 4444.719
my parents didn't know that for me so i

4441.36 --> 4447.199
just took regular milk

4444.719 --> 4448.719
and yeah that turns out to not be all

4447.199 --> 4455.36
that great

4448.719 --> 4458.56
you know pasteurized milk and all that

4455.36 --> 4461.199
i hope there are still

4458.56 --> 4463.76
like farmer dairy farmers out there that

4461.199 --> 4466.4
just sell it raw

4463.76 --> 4467.04
like at the farm to figure out where

4466.4 --> 4468.48
that would be

4467.04 --> 4470.8
i don't know if that's still around in

4468.48 --> 4483.839999999999
the netherlands

4470.8 --> 4483.84
i hope so

4485.92 --> 4490.719
mostly turkish and africans go there

4488.48 --> 4490.718999999999
right

4491.04 --> 4494.32
oh boy i didn't know

4494.4 --> 4498.48
i suspected they would be around

4498.64 --> 4503.92
but i've not not been too exploratory

4501.679 --> 4504.96
also i'm not very good at looking up

4503.92 --> 4507.04
things

4504.96 --> 4508.2390000000005
it's just a talent that doesn't seem to

4507.04 --> 4510.32
be very

4508.239 --> 4512.5599999999995
great compared to some other people out

4510.32 --> 4525.84
there

4512.56 --> 4525.84
no raw products here that sucks

4531.76 --> 4539.679
hmm yeah that's great for in each

4535.6 --> 4541.679
well back when i live with my ex

4539.679 --> 4544.4
we went to a farm where they had like

4541.679 --> 4547.1990000000005
fresh meat and that was like

4544.4 --> 4548.879999999999
organic high quality that was like the

4547.199 --> 4552.719
best

4548.88 --> 4556.32
beef that i've ever tasted

4552.719 --> 4557.76
super fresh and just maximum organic

4556.32 --> 4559.44
quality

4557.76 --> 4561.76
like these animals had a pretty good

4559.44 --> 4561.759999999999
life

4561.84 --> 4567.92
and the soil over there was really pure

4565.679 --> 4569.4400000000005
and these people were like christians

4567.92 --> 4571.1990000000005
pretty devout

4569.44 --> 4572.5599999999995
i think they were probably even like

4571.199 --> 4575.199
flat earth level

4572.56 --> 4581.84
christians from an old block i don't

4575.199 --> 4581.839999999999
know i didn't know them too well

4585.52 --> 4589.1990000000005
but yeah that was great stuff

4591.28 --> 4596.48
that was just around the corner oh

4596.64 --> 4602.400000000001
all right well

4600.56 --> 4604.88
as soon as i'm gonna get some kind of a

4602.4 --> 4606.239
car which i had been planning for a

4604.88 --> 4609.84
while and who knows

4606.239 --> 4609.839999999999
yeah better living circumstances

4609.92 --> 4614.96
and money available then i will figure

4613.199 --> 4617.12
out these things

4614.96 --> 4619.679
because now it becomes financially

4617.12 --> 4619.679
viable

4620.719 --> 4625.36
but i'm not going to rush it you know

4623.76 --> 4628.719
for me it's been like yeah yeah i

4625.36 --> 4632.48
promise the world is full of promises

4628.719 --> 4633.36
let's just get there when it arrives you

4632.48 --> 4636.799999999999
know

4633.36 --> 4640.159
if it actually happens because i'm

4636.8 --> 4643.28
just very wary of just

4640.159 --> 4644.799999999999
going for it on base of a promise you

4643.28 --> 4648.32
know at this point

4644.8 --> 4651.360000000001
very weary of this i'm

4648.32 --> 4653.599999999999
yeah it's not surprising

4651.36 --> 4655.92
with what has recently happened but in

4653.6 --> 4658.96
general i have been like that

4655.92 --> 4662.08
like even with the with the the crypto

4658.96 --> 4664.159
thing that program that i'm part of

4662.08 --> 4665.28
it's just well i haven't invested

4664.159 --> 4667.5199999999995
anything in it you know

4665.28 --> 4668.96
i've technically gotten a lot more money

4667.52 --> 4672.159000000001
out of it out of a zero

4668.96 --> 4674.56
investment vantage point which is

4672.159 --> 4675.199
pretty remarkable in my opinion it's

4674.56 --> 4679.679
really

4675.199 --> 4683.759999999999
it's good so

4679.679 --> 4688.4
but yeah even it has inner struggles

4683.76 --> 4691.4400000000005
not terrible just like complications

4688.4 --> 4693.679
just complicated but not

4691.44 --> 4695.04
nothing really dramatic it's just

4693.679 --> 4699.13
judicial

4695.04 --> 4700.48
mechanical market financial

4699.13 --> 4702.8
[Music]

4700.48 --> 4706.5599999999995
complicated it's way out of my hands

4702.8 --> 4709.76
like that

4706.56 --> 4713.360000000001
but yeah they might be needing

4709.76 --> 4715.679
certain promises to to basically

4713.36 --> 4718.159
start dangling certain things to get us

4715.679 --> 4721.4400000000005
through a certain situation like they

4718.159 --> 4723.5199999999995
it's pretty big group and the top of it

4721.44 --> 4725.678999999999
is really trying to just manage the

4723.52 --> 4728.400000000001
situation a lot

4725.679 --> 4730.32
so i just wonder like is that real well

4728.4 --> 4732.719
if it is

4730.32 --> 4733.679
and they seem pretty adamant from what i

4732.719 --> 4736.8
heard

4733.679 --> 4741.1990000000005
yeah i'll see i'm still not gonna

4736.8 --> 4741.1990000000005
go by it but we'll see

4741.44 --> 4744.799999999999
and if it is it's great that's the

4743.04 --> 4746.8
moment i've been waiting for that's the

4744.8 --> 4750.2390000000005
moment to break out and start

4746.8 --> 4755.1990000000005
doing stuff again

4750.239 --> 4758.799999999999
finally after seven years

4755.199 --> 4758.799999999999
more eight years

4758.96 --> 4763.84
of being just in financially in the

4761.44 --> 4766.4
gutter pretty much

4763.84 --> 4766.400000000001
can't wait

4772.719 --> 4777.84
start to research your local groups

4780.4 --> 4784.719
oh i bet well look the netherlands is

4783.04 --> 4788.159
pretty good

4784.719 --> 4791.199
and there are some really tenacious

4788.159 --> 4794.48
farmers here too like

4791.199 --> 4797.919999999999
the politics is often attacking like

4794.48 --> 4801.36
farmers and all that but the dutch

4797.92 --> 4801.36
have a very old

4801.6 --> 4805.52
farming tradition as it were some of

4803.679 --> 4808.719
them whatever's left so

4805.52 --> 4812.0
yeah i was hoping to

4808.719 --> 4813.84
and expected to find them if i

4812.0 --> 4816.4
just looked carefully if i just really

4813.84 --> 4819.12
took out the time and started exploring

4816.4 --> 4819.839999999999
the region from a vantage point of

4819.12 --> 4822.8
confidence

4819.84 --> 4823.6
and financial security instead of just

4822.8 --> 4825.84
like

4823.6 --> 4828.2390000000005
i'm poor as [Â __Â ] i'm just going to feel

4825.84 --> 4831.1990000000005
like a poor guy looking around

4828.239 --> 4832.08
i don't want that i want to have my eyes

4831.199 --> 4836.08
fully open

4832.08 --> 4840.0
and just yeah

4836.08 --> 4844.159
with security and that's yeah

4840.0 --> 4846.8
effective ineffective it is what it is

4844.159 --> 4847.759999999999
dutch farming is world famous indeed is

4846.8 --> 4850.400000000001
it

4847.76 --> 4852.400000000001
well i i'd like to think so and i also

4850.4 --> 4855.12
know that there's been a lot of

4852.4 --> 4855.759999999999
mechanical and technical innovations in

4855.12 --> 4858.719
forming

4855.76 --> 4858.719
which is excellent

4858.8 --> 4866.56
now i also hope that they are

4862.0 --> 4869.36
catching on to like the soil revolution

4866.56 --> 4870.56
a lot i really do because it's necessary

4869.36 --> 4873.36
it's the it

4870.56 --> 4874.080000000001
it as i would like to say it could make

4873.36 --> 4877.28
the netherlands

4874.08 --> 4878.5599999999995
great again it could make the whole

4877.28 --> 4880.8
world great again but hey

4878.56 --> 4882.159000000001
netherlands like if we could be the on

4880.8 --> 4885.28
the front line with that

4882.159 --> 4887.759999999999
with soil revolution that's awesome

4885.28 --> 4890.08
i think probably that's already going on

4887.76 --> 4892.96
there's whole studies

4890.08 --> 4893.679
surrounding that sort of thing for some

4892.96 --> 4896.719
time

4893.679 --> 4898.96
so there should be anyway maybe the

4896.719 --> 4903.679
world is a lot better than i've even

4898.96 --> 4905.92
than i know like that around me

4903.679 --> 4909.679
but i'm definitely good yeah at some

4905.92 --> 4914.56
point if i get financially more secure

4909.679 --> 4914.56
it seems to be in the near future for me

4914.84 --> 4920.719
then going to explore

4917.199 --> 4925.36
what is your genetics it's human

4920.719 --> 4925.36
as far as i know eric f bear

4929.28 --> 4934.159
but i haven't tested it anytime recently

4931.84 --> 4934.159000000001
so

4936.48 --> 4940.4
i don't think i've ever had my genetics

4942.84 --> 4945.84
tested

4952.41 --> 4957.8589999999995
[Music]

4958.639 --> 4962.2390000000005
right robin stanley well i i agree in a

4961.92 --> 4966.719
way

4962.239 --> 4967.44
i i sympathize with farming a lot and i

4966.719 --> 4970.4
think that

4967.44 --> 4972.96
just like there should be like i

4970.4 --> 4975.28
appreciate for example i don't know

4972.96 --> 4976.8
but still as much though but the the

4975.28 --> 4979.84
pirate party

4976.8 --> 4982.639
which is like for

4979.84 --> 4983.4400000000005
digital security and efficiency they're

4982.639 --> 4986.719
like

4983.44 --> 4989.199
the internet political political group

4986.719 --> 4993.12
now they're kind of leftist though

4989.199 --> 4996.4
but hey i think that they

4993.12 --> 4996.719
could go pretty well they're not really

4996.4 --> 4999.679
like

4996.719 --> 4999.92
maniacal liberals or anything as far as

4999.679 --> 5003.76
i

4999.92 --> 5006.4800000000005
know it hasn't

5003.76 --> 5007.280000000001
revealed itself if it were the case like

5006.48 --> 5010.239
that

5007.28 --> 5010.639
to me maybe i overlooked again i'm not

5010.239 --> 5013.5199999999995
like

5010.639 --> 5016.0
on top of the dutch political scene i

5013.52 --> 5018.159000000001
haven't looked widely into it too much

5016.0 --> 5019.92
but i have been associating myself with

5018.159 --> 5021.36
the pirate party in the past

5019.92 --> 5023.84
because i really appreciated their

5021.36 --> 5026.48
approach and it's like yeah we need

5023.84 --> 5029.360000000001
digital security there's going to be

5026.48 --> 5032.159
digital warfare happening

5029.36 --> 5033.92
in many ways and we need people in

5032.159 --> 5037.199
control that are on top of that

5033.92 --> 5039.28
because politicians they're often just

5037.199 --> 5040.96
idiots they don't understand the

5039.28 --> 5044.8
technology and that's been

5040.96 --> 5047.76
widely recorded if throughout the world

5044.8 --> 5050.400000000001
so we need a couple that are like on top

5047.76 --> 5053.76
of the digital security well i think

5050.4 --> 5054.719
we should have a farmer group like that

5053.76 --> 5057.92
too that'll

5054.719 --> 5061.76
help farm transit into this modernized

5057.92 --> 5065.12
super farming that is very

5061.76 --> 5068.719
efficient and natural

5065.12 --> 5071.04
and doesn't destroy the land

5068.719 --> 5072.08
and i think yeah they should be

5071.04 --> 5076.88
protected from

5072.08 --> 5079.199
political exploits

5076.88 --> 5080.8
so that has been another idea and i

5079.199 --> 5082.4
don't know maybe there are some groups

5080.8 --> 5083.6
that are kind of latching onto that

5082.4 --> 5088.719
concept

5083.6 --> 5088.719
but i'd love to be helping out with that

5091.28 --> 5094.48
so we can have like internet security

5093.36 --> 5097.5199999999995
and

5094.48 --> 5098.0
food security because i think it's

5097.52 --> 5100.4800000000005
really

5098.0 --> 5102.32
important that the netherlands does not

5100.48 --> 5105.678999999999
under any circumstance

5102.32 --> 5108.08
any circumstance abandon

5105.679 --> 5109.6
their ability to feed their own people

5108.08 --> 5111.679
locally

5109.6 --> 5113.360000000001
because as soon as we become

5111.679 --> 5115.6
internationally dependent

5113.36 --> 5117.599999999999
it's going to be hell it's going to be

5115.6 --> 5119.679
very dangerous

5117.6 --> 5121.120000000001
and we risk that because hey we are part

5119.679 --> 5125.28
of europe

5121.12 --> 5129.84
europe is not it's not nice

5125.28 --> 5132.32
like okay there is some effectiveness

5129.84 --> 5133.84
is there some cohesion but like this

5132.32 --> 5137.759999999999
government of europe is

5133.84 --> 5137.76
is not good news guys

5138.159 --> 5145.04
these people are not they are

5141.679 --> 5148.2390000000005
focusing it seems a lot on power and

5145.04 --> 5154.56
power over people

5148.239 --> 5157.44
and being invasive like that

5154.56 --> 5158.400000000001
with the wider strategies and the wider

5157.44 --> 5160.719
plans and

5158.4 --> 5162.08
they are trying to take our dependent

5160.719 --> 5164.159
independency away

5162.08 --> 5166.639
just systematically as part of that is

5164.159 --> 5169.92
not good news so we need

5166.639 --> 5171.36
we need some anchor points which we hold

5169.92 --> 5173.76
on and survive

5171.36 --> 5175.759999999999
thanks to them and i think that digital

5173.76 --> 5178.639
security

5175.76 --> 5179.76
and food security are critical for the

5178.639 --> 5183.12
netherlands

5179.76 --> 5197.84
we could do really well despite being a

5183.12 --> 5197.84
very small country

5207.6 --> 5211.84
right robin sally

5221.04 --> 5225.84
here we go again now you mean the genome

5223.12 --> 5225.84
project

5226.96 --> 5234.159
no the genome project

5230.4 --> 5237.04
it was just it it was an attempt

5234.159 --> 5238.879999999999
and i think it was kind of completed but

5237.04 --> 5240.48
then when they completed it they just

5238.88 --> 5241.28
figured out that it wasn't what they

5240.48 --> 5242.599999999999
thought it was

5241.28 --> 5245.12
and then they figured out about

5242.6 --> 5248.96
epigenetics and then everything became

5245.12 --> 5252.8
just a lot more complicated

5248.96 --> 5256.159
and bigger but i think that

5252.8 --> 5257.52
the original mapping project of genetics

5256.159 --> 5262.32
of the human genome

5257.52 --> 5262.320000000001
was completed i think so

5263.52 --> 5267.84
i remember that

5271.92 --> 5275.6
it just didn't yield the result that

5274.88 --> 5281.84
they

5275.6 --> 5281.84
originally thought it was going to

5286.8 --> 5293.4400000000005
oh nathan yamaha

5290.48 --> 5296.48
465 do you think english is a global

5293.44 --> 5298.08
language helps mankind progress

5296.48 --> 5301.36
how did you become so good at english

5298.08 --> 5304.32
well believing in it

5301.36 --> 5306.799999999999
having a heart for it and trading it all

5304.32 --> 5306.799999999999
my life

5307.44 --> 5311.44
just i decided i got to be good at

5309.36 --> 5313.839999999999
english it's important and the funny

5311.44 --> 5313.839999999999
thing is

5314.56 --> 5317.6
in babylon 5 in that sci-fi series that

5317.199 --> 5320.96
we

5317.6 --> 5324.2390000000005
that i saw and here we go again too

5320.96 --> 5325.52
it's been a while mostly in december i

5324.239 --> 5328.879999999999
think

5325.52 --> 5329.76
is they call english like the aliens in

5328.88 --> 5333.04
there refer

5329.76 --> 5335.84
to english as the lang the earth

5333.04 --> 5337.5199999999995
language of commerce isn't that

5335.84 --> 5341.1990000000005
fascinating

5337.52 --> 5341.1990000000005
and i think there is something to this

5341.52 --> 5345.76
so maybe english is just the language of

5348.84 --> 5351.84
commerce

5362.84 --> 5369.12
yay

5365.12 --> 5369.12
do you think in english or dutch

5369.36 --> 5372.48
i can think in both

5375.199 --> 5382.239
you might be surprised that

5379.199 --> 5385.36
in english my word range

5382.239 --> 5387.199
is bigger than it is in dutch in certain

5385.36 --> 5393.839999999999
areas especially

5387.199 --> 5393.839999999999
mechanical specifics especially physics

5398.56 --> 5403.52
like from a dutch perspective from yeah

5401.76 --> 5405.679
in dutch i have more trouble with

5403.52 --> 5409.1990000000005
mechanical language

5405.679 --> 5412.0
but i can improvise it turned out that

5409.199 --> 5413.5199999999995
basically thinking like english but then

5412.0 --> 5416.48
dutchifying it but

5413.52 --> 5418.080000000001
in the proper way is kind of a separate

5416.48 --> 5420.718999999999
art and intuitive art and i

5418.08 --> 5421.36
have been pretty good at it in at

5420.719 --> 5423.92
basically

5421.36 --> 5425.599999999999
improvisingly figuring out how you would

5423.92 --> 5429.04
use the word in dutch

5425.6 --> 5429.04
what the dutch word would be

5429.12 --> 5435.199
so yeah it's weird like that isn't it

5432.8 --> 5436.08
but i might know more english than i

5435.199 --> 5439.44
know dutch

5436.08 --> 5441.679
but hey i know quite a few dutch

5439.44 --> 5443.199
expressions and ways of saying things

5441.679 --> 5448.4800000000005
and i am

5443.199 --> 5462.4
more at ease with dutch there's more

5448.48 --> 5465.44
it's easier more natural to me

5462.4 --> 5468.239
my english vocabulary is brilliant you

5465.44 --> 5468.239
flatter me

5473.92 --> 5477.28
it just with english it there are so

5475.92 --> 5480.719
many baskets

5477.28 --> 5482.8
to take from there's so many options

5480.719 --> 5484.8
that i've come across and that is like

5482.8 --> 5485.84
oh that's a great way of saying that oh

5484.8 --> 5490.08
that's great oh

5485.84 --> 5493.52
that and it just i cut this giant basket

5490.08 --> 5493.5199999999995
and so many options

5500.56 --> 5507.56
and also i really love using english

5504.239 --> 5509.759999999999
english is a great language for

5507.56 --> 5513.360000000001
metaphorizing

5509.76 --> 5514.6
for getting metaphorical and it's also a

5513.36 --> 5517.5199999999995
great linkage for

5514.6 --> 5520.4400000000005
improvisation with words

5517.52 --> 5523.6
because even though you can use a word

5520.44 --> 5526.159
improvisingly use it

5523.6 --> 5528.2390000000005
when it's technically not a correct word

5526.159 --> 5530.4
but people will still understand it

5528.239 --> 5532.799999999999
because of

5530.4 --> 5535.44
because of english because of the

5532.8 --> 5538.96
mechanical consistency

5535.44 --> 5542.08
english is a language that builds

5538.96 --> 5542.8
more english very systematically very

5542.08 --> 5544.719
easily

5542.8 --> 5547.84
it's very easy to build new things in

5544.719 --> 5547.84
english that's yeah

5547.92 --> 5553.679
and i've i've learned how to do that too

5551.04 --> 5556.0
how to build with english in the english

5553.679 --> 5556.0
way

5557.76 --> 5563.1990000000005
but more american that sends more

5560.88 --> 5564.639
universal english because like how the

5563.199 --> 5567.44
british

5564.639 --> 5567.84
do english that's a whole nother world

5567.44 --> 5570.4
like

5567.84 --> 5570.400000000001
i'm just

5571.04 --> 5574.159
i can i can try to emulate some of it i

5573.6 --> 5577.4400000000005
do

5574.159 --> 5580.48
get it as i would get certain dutch

5577.44 --> 5589.839999999999
things but it's just not it's not

5580.48 --> 5589.839999999999
the same it's cultural it's all cultural

5592.88 --> 5598.2390000000005
but yeah as a mechanical language as a

5595.6 --> 5600.159000000001
and as a language of commerce

5598.239 --> 5603.839999999999
as it said in babylon 5 i think it's

5600.159 --> 5603.839999999999
great it's very

5604.639 --> 5607.36
adaptable

5607.679 --> 5614.2390000000005
very easy to get creative with

5610.8 --> 5617.04
and communicate effectively so like

5614.239 --> 5618.239
being creative with it and effectively

5617.04 --> 5621.76
commuting

5618.239 --> 5623.199
communicating that creativity that's not

5621.76 --> 5628.400000000001
that easy

5623.199 --> 5628.4
you know it's not easy to do that with a

5628.84 --> 5633.360000000001
language

5630.159 --> 5636.5599999999995
and yeah english is

5633.36 --> 5638.639
has been very effective for doing that

5636.56 --> 5641.280000000001
with me at least and i think i'm not

5638.639 --> 5641.28
alone at it

5642.239 --> 5648.0
oh premiere by don't get dramatic come

5645.84 --> 5648.0
on

5653.6 --> 5657.52
but anyway thank you all for the

5654.96 --> 5661.84
compliments

5657.52 --> 5663.679
i do my best and i'm very happy with it

5661.84 --> 5665.92
i'm very happy with the skill range i

5663.679 --> 5665.92
got

5666.4 --> 5670.638999999999
it's definitely been worth it

5669.03 --> 5673.12
[Music]

5670.639 --> 5675.04
worth that decision very young like i am

5673.12 --> 5676.88
going to be

5675.04 --> 5679.04
well let's just say i'm going to be

5676.88 --> 5680.639
optimus prime because that really what

5679.04 --> 5684.56
started it

5680.639 --> 5687.679
like oh i like that sound i like that

5684.56 --> 5690.4800000000005
attitude i like how that english

5687.679 --> 5691.1990000000005
works and then it's like yeah i'm i'm

5690.48 --> 5693.839999999999
going to be

5691.199 --> 5693.839999999999
like that too

5696.56 --> 5700.4800000000005
yes sounds kind of weird right optimus

5698.639 --> 5701.119
prime now i'm talking about the original

5700.48 --> 5703.5199999999995
g1

5701.119 --> 5705.44
and when i look back at that oh my god

5703.52 --> 5707.76
it's so silly

5705.44 --> 5709.759999999999
but as a very little kid i think it was

5707.76 --> 5712.8
like five or six

5709.76 --> 5714.96
yeah that really worked on me and hey it

5712.8 --> 5717.52
was in another language

5714.96 --> 5718.56
you know and it was subtitled so it's

5717.52 --> 5721.52
like i'm

5718.56 --> 5721.52
six years old

5722.08 --> 5726.32
i understand language my own language

5724.239 --> 5728.5599999999995
dutch pretty good and i'm watching this

5726.32 --> 5730.239
stuff and it's like with dutch subtitles

5728.56 --> 5733.52
so it's almost like a school

5730.239 --> 5734.48
challenge just reading in dutch and then

5733.52 --> 5736.080000000001
tying it in

5734.48 --> 5737.839999999999
with what i'm hearing in the other

5736.08 --> 5740.88
language and then

5737.84 --> 5744.639
yeah it's pretty close it's like i

5740.88 --> 5748.2390000000005
it i i was able to get it i was

5744.639 --> 5750.639
i got it and then i started to

5748.239 --> 5751.759999999999
really young try to emulate it was very

5750.639 --> 5754.400000000001
choppy

5751.76 --> 5756.56
i didn't get the grammatics right the

5754.4 --> 5759.36
the setup of the sentences

5756.56 --> 5760.96
but the pronunciation got in pretty well

5759.36 --> 5763.36
early on

5760.96 --> 5765.52
like i got the accent of american and

5763.36 --> 5768.0
all that

5765.52 --> 5769.679
like genuine american not stereotypical

5768.0 --> 5772.88
american

5769.679 --> 5775.92
and then eventually yeah i

5772.88 --> 5782.159000000001
started to inquire my parents about

5775.92 --> 5782.159
english like let's try to talk english

5782.239 --> 5786.5599999999995
and i did that like i did that before i

5784.239 --> 5788.08
even got english in school

5786.56 --> 5790.4800000000005
and then when i did get english in

5788.08 --> 5793.84
school i was just bragging

5790.48 --> 5795.919999999999
like like oh i am like i can talk with

5793.84 --> 5797.360000000001
my teacher in english perfectly and it's

5795.92 --> 5800.159
like oh no teacher

5797.36 --> 5801.679
you said that word incorrectly like

5800.159 --> 5804.159
literally that sort of [Â __Â ]

5801.679 --> 5806.08
i would do that and now talking like

5804.159 --> 5808.239
yeah very early

5806.08 --> 5810.08
it's not proper english teachers just a

5808.239 --> 5811.678999999999
general teacher that would also teach a

5810.08 --> 5813.679
little bit of english and i would just

5811.679 --> 5816.639
outshine them even because i was so

5813.679 --> 5820.0
enthusiastic about english

5816.639 --> 5823.76
it was the language of the tele

5820.0 --> 5826.239
but it was great language of cartoons

5823.76 --> 5829.04
and the language of bbc documentaries

5826.239 --> 5831.36
and bbc nature documentaries oh my god

5829.04 --> 5834.0
what a delight it was to be able to

5831.36 --> 5837.04
understand that as well

5834.0 --> 5839.76
as i could when i first

5837.04 --> 5840.159
bumped into that sort of thing i was

5839.76 --> 5842.88
really

5840.159 --> 5844.799999999999
big favorite in the family too so it's

5842.88 --> 5848.639
just great to really

5844.8 --> 5850.96
learn a lot about animals and nature

5848.639 --> 5853.119
and being able to because it's actually

5850.96 --> 5855.84
in a language you can understand

5853.119 --> 5855.839999999999
how about that

5857.119 --> 5862.719
i bet you were really annoying oh god

5859.84 --> 5862.719
super annoying

5866.48 --> 5870.0
and weird sometimes too because i did

5869.679 --> 5874.639
like

5870.0 --> 5876.08
characters i did like weird characters

5874.639 --> 5877.76
because there was a lot of feelings that

5876.08 --> 5879.84
i had no idea what to do with them and

5877.76 --> 5884.320000000001
it's just like i feel like

5879.84 --> 5884.32
acting like a nutty silly clown

5884.4 --> 5891.759999999999
and then yeah made a habit of that

5887.6 --> 5891.76
was even quite shameless about it

5892.48 --> 5896.08
it's just like yeah i'm just walking in

5894.48 --> 5899.599999999999
like a like a

5896.08 --> 5902.719
weird looking idiot

5899.6 --> 5904.8
like yeah i'm playing that

5902.719 --> 5906.56
and then having a lot of confidence

5904.8 --> 5907.679
through that that was the weird part so

5906.56 --> 5911.679
it was almost like a

5907.679 --> 5915.04
live comedy thing but very psychological

5911.679 --> 5915.4400000000005
anyway i'm not gonna do that it's just

5915.04 --> 5920.48
that

5915.44 --> 5920.48
it all came together

5921.76 --> 5925.84
i love it when a plan comes together

5930.8 --> 5937.04
yeah but if you think about all that

5933.92 --> 5939.36
stuff transformers how it inspired my

5937.04 --> 5942.8
english

5939.36 --> 5945.04
and cartoons and it is kind of logical

5942.8 --> 5945.04
that

5945.76 --> 5950.719
like that alex jones in a way was like

5947.92 --> 5953.28
the next level for me

5950.719 --> 5955.199
i do really like i've gotten to know a

5953.28 --> 5958.719
lot about american culture through

5955.199 --> 5962.638999999999
alex jones like in the early days

5958.719 --> 5964.88
a lot so it felt almost like a

5962.639 --> 5967.84
continuation of my self-appointed

5964.88 --> 5967.84
education

5969.6 --> 5975.119000000001
i learned pretty much about the separate

5973.199 --> 5979.28
states from the united states

5975.119 --> 5980.08
in that period like before that i didn't

5979.28 --> 5982.08
even know

5980.08 --> 5984.159
like what yeah it's just a really big

5982.08 --> 5987.28
country i don't know

5984.159 --> 5989.599999999999
what there's differences between the

5987.28 --> 5992.32
regions and the cultures what

5989.6 --> 5994.08
i had no idea it's just like oh it's

5992.32 --> 5995.36
just a really big country on the other

5994.08 --> 5998.32
side well now

5995.36 --> 6000.32
i know a lot more about it i probably

5998.32 --> 6002.88
know more about the united states than i

6000.32 --> 6002.88
do about

6006.84 --> 6009.84
europe

6013.36 --> 6017.04
although that doesn't mean a lot but

6017.6 --> 6020.719
it's not that i know that

6021.679 --> 6027.119
to much japanese japanese is very cool

6024.96 --> 6037.84
language

6027.119 --> 6037.839999999999
it's tough

6046.719 --> 6051.84
hello by the way julie of heaven good to

6048.56 --> 6051.84
see you

6052.719 --> 6065.84
and chris berry came in earlier

6067.199 --> 6070.48
learning language as an adult is really

6069.28 --> 6079.84
difficult

6070.48 --> 6079.839999999999
it can be

6086.48 --> 6092.638999999999
i think learning a language as an adult

6089.92 --> 6096.08
probably can work

6092.639 --> 6097.52
if you have like a hundred percent of

6096.08 --> 6099.6
the time for it

6097.52 --> 6101.360000000001
like that you're like don't have any

6099.6 --> 6104.0
other response that you can truly

6101.36 --> 6104.0
relinquish

6104.8 --> 6109.1990000000005
like yeah the problem with adults is

6106.8 --> 6112.0
they are very busy with stuff and like

6109.199 --> 6114.32
family and jobs and stuff and yeah

6112.0 --> 6115.199
you're constantly tied into a habit

6114.32 --> 6117.04
circuit

6115.199 --> 6119.119
it's very tough to learn a language like

6117.04 --> 6121.119
that but if somehow you could

6119.119 --> 6123.839999999999
be able to step away from that from a

6121.119 --> 6127.44
for a period

6123.84 --> 6128.32
and then 100 percent focus like also

6127.44 --> 6131.5199999999995
knowingly

6128.32 --> 6132.96
like you have that room to 100 focus on

6131.52 --> 6135.84
just that language

6132.96 --> 6138.0
being submersed in it being with people

6135.84 --> 6141.76
that

6138.0 --> 6143.84
that genuinely know the details of it

6141.76 --> 6145.1990000000005
that are from the origin that yeah i

6143.84 --> 6149.28
think that it would be

6145.199 --> 6152.0
very much doable

6149.28 --> 6153.92
it is it's really did the time yeah the

6152.0 --> 6156.159
the connections with the world and the

6153.92 --> 6158.96
busying

6156.159 --> 6158.96
the work you do

6159.679 --> 6163.04
the habit circuit that makes it

6161.92 --> 6166.56
difficult

6163.04 --> 6166.56
to learn a new language

6170.8 --> 6174.56
and at the same time it makes it also

6172.56 --> 6177.92
much more doable if you're

6174.56 --> 6180.0
for example in the other country

6177.92 --> 6182.0
and constantly everybody talks of that

6180.0 --> 6184.239
language around you well then

6182.0 --> 6185.36
if you're open for it and the people are

6184.239 --> 6187.919999999999
okay

6185.36 --> 6190.5599999999995
they like you yeah then you can also

6187.92 --> 6192.8
learn it much quicker

6190.56 --> 6194.080000000001
than just trying to learn it off some

6192.8 --> 6205.84
kind of study

6194.08 --> 6205.84
on the internet or something

6207.199 --> 6210.32
all right chris berry

6212.08 --> 6215.5199999999995
yeah well german

6216.639 --> 6225.04
i yeah i had german in school too

6220.08 --> 6225.04
i'm okay at it it's like

6226.08 --> 6229.76
i don't know a lot about it

6230.0 --> 6234.159
but it is a language that i can

6231.76 --> 6236.719
basically

6234.159 --> 6237.679
make out what they're saying pretty well

6236.719 --> 6239.44
on average

6237.679 --> 6242.2390000000005
even though i don't know everything i'm

6239.44 --> 6242.879999999999
in german and also it's very close to

6242.239 --> 6246.5599999999995
dutch

6242.88 --> 6249.04
in ways and yeah that way

6246.56 --> 6250.0
i can still communicate with german

6249.04 --> 6251.679
people

6250.0 --> 6254.0
and or at least make out what they're

6251.679 --> 6254.0
saying

6257.28 --> 6263.759999999999
ah julie of heaven right you're fluent

6260.08 --> 6263.76
in portuguese that's awesome

6265.36 --> 6275.839999999999
because your wife is portuguese that's

6267.28 --> 6275.84
really cool

6279.09 --> 6286.33
[Music]

6286.84 --> 6293.6
hmm

6289.6 --> 6296.88
yeah yeah my ex-girlfriend was like

6293.6 --> 6300.159000000001
half german sorta but

6296.88 --> 6303.4400000000005
yeah her mother was german a german who

6300.159 --> 6305.679
came to live in the netherlands i think

6303.44 --> 6305.678999999999
and

6307.04 --> 6313.28
like i was like planning to be basically

6310.32 --> 6314.08
married to her and eventually learn

6313.28 --> 6316.0
german

6314.08 --> 6317.44
through her that's so it's kind of funny

6316.0 --> 6318.96
that you mentioned it that you

6317.44 --> 6321.199
have learned portuguese through your

6318.96 --> 6321.199
wife

6322.239 --> 6328.159
because my ex was pretty good

6325.36 --> 6328.799999999999
like with accent and all the details in

6328.159 --> 6332.5599999999995
in german

6328.8 --> 6335.28
it's like oh wow that would be

6332.56 --> 6336.56
cool if i could learn that too but that

6335.28 --> 6338.48
only works if you

6336.56 --> 6339.92
if you're with that person for a very

6338.48 --> 6342.0
long time and then at some point

6339.92 --> 6345.84
dedicate to it

6342.0 --> 6345.84
but yeah that wasn't meant to be

6349.04 --> 6353.44
you're fluent in [Â __Â ] because your

6351.36 --> 6356.08
ex-wife was a [Â __Â ]

6353.44 --> 6356.5599999999995
yeah well if that's the language they

6356.08 --> 6360.8
speak

6356.56 --> 6360.8
yeah you will learn about it i know

6363.52 --> 6367.4400000000005
i speak fluent sarcasm

6368.239 --> 6373.839999999999
i bet you do

6375.28 --> 6381.44
you're fluent in bastard alrighty then

6380.08 --> 6387.84
get it all off your chest in the

6381.44 --> 6387.839999999999
meantime i'll be back in two minutes

6412.84 --> 6415.84
so

6486.88 --> 6499.84
all right

6509.119 --> 6514.96
yeah tiny womble

6512.4 --> 6516.638999999999
here we go again has blocked you so

6514.96 --> 6519.28
don't talk to

6516.639 --> 6519.28
them okay

6521.6 --> 6527.84
go again knows because i said it i read

6524.88 --> 6527.84
your comment

6538.84 --> 6541.84
anyway

6543.119 --> 6546.96
it's all done with good humor well i

6545.119 --> 6550.4
guess that there we go again doesn't

6546.96 --> 6555.76
have your sense of humor then

6550.4 --> 6557.759999999999
it happens sometimes tiny wumble

6555.76 --> 6559.68
it's called rubbing each other the wrong

6557.76 --> 6562.819
way

6559.68 --> 6562.819
[Music]

6566.88 --> 6569.84
oh okay

6571.04 --> 6583.84
yeah that's i know this time

6591.28 --> 6597.84
oh now to get my kids to learn spanish

6594.56 --> 6597.84
and portuguese

6606.0 --> 6612.32
well if i don't

6609.04 --> 6613.92
i don't know if you have already

6612.32 --> 6616.88
kind of planned it out julia of heaven

6613.92 --> 6620.719
but a way you could do it

6616.88 --> 6623.119
is for example go on vacation

6620.719 --> 6623.76
to a country where they exclusively

6623.119 --> 6627.119
speak

6623.76 --> 6630.159000000001
either one of those languages

6627.119 --> 6633.598999999999
then really yeah try to find yeah

6630.159 --> 6634.48
way to really yeah it's just the best

6633.599 --> 6636.88
thing is to just

6634.48 --> 6639.199
find the right type of environment where

6636.88 --> 6642.400000000001
everybody's very

6639.199 --> 6646.08
nice and communicative and you can

6642.4 --> 6648.5599999999995
be like a part of their little society

6646.08 --> 6650.0
and then that way get exposed to the

6648.56 --> 6652.159000000001
language

6650.0 --> 6653.44
that'll typically get your kids

6652.159 --> 6656.159
enthusiastic

6653.44 --> 6656.638999999999
about it i don't know it depends on the

6656.159 --> 6659.598999999999
age

6656.639 --> 6660.88
though then if once they catch that

6659.599 --> 6664.32
enthusiasm

6660.88 --> 6667.52
and start engaging in trying to learn

6664.32 --> 6667.759999999999
that new language with those people then

6667.52 --> 6669.040000000001
you

6667.76 --> 6671.360000000001
yeah at some point you're going to go

6669.04 --> 6674.239
back from vacation and then you can

6671.36 --> 6675.36
literally engage make them engaged

6674.239 --> 6678.48
because they're motivated

6675.36 --> 6680.48
into like a language course

6678.48 --> 6682.638999999999
then they'll have the memory of that

6680.48 --> 6685.678999999999
vacation to kind of support their

6682.639 --> 6688.56
motivation you see and then

6685.679 --> 6689.36
at some point they can go back perhaps

6688.56 --> 6692.080000000001
and test

6689.36 --> 6694.32
what they've learned and that way you

6692.08 --> 6697.599
can get them really enthusiastic

6694.32 --> 6702.88
as my parents tried that too with me and

6697.599 --> 6702.88
spanish here's the thing though

6703.44 --> 6708.159
they really tried they really did they

6706.0 --> 6712.08
went to spain so many times

6708.159 --> 6714.799999999999
throughout my youth but problem was

6712.08 --> 6717.199
it seems like all the other spanish kids

6714.8 --> 6720.639
were much more interested

6717.199 --> 6723.839999999999
in my english skill so

6720.639 --> 6726.32
i ended up teaching them english

6723.84 --> 6728.4800000000005
and learning a couple of spanish words

6726.32 --> 6731.04
but mostly just

6728.48 --> 6731.759999999999
like how do i make spanish people

6731.04 --> 6734.639
understand

6731.76 --> 6736.0
english that's what i ended up learning

6734.639 --> 6738.08
in all that time

6736.0 --> 6740.4
so i didn't end up really learning

6738.08 --> 6743.199
spanish

6740.4 --> 6746.159
more like spanglish i learned how to

6743.199 --> 6746.159
speak spanglish

6746.4 --> 6750.638999999999
like how because spanish people that are

6749.04 --> 6753.119
not too great at english

6750.639 --> 6753.679
typically i've learned this speak span

6753.119 --> 6758.159
english

6753.679 --> 6761.52
in a certain way using the

6758.159 --> 6764.4
the way of speaking of spanish

6761.52 --> 6766.400000000001
in and then trying to do that trying to

6764.4 --> 6769.679
use that to speak english

6766.4 --> 6773.119
and i totally get how this works

6769.679 --> 6775.1990000000005
and i can speak in that way and then

6773.119 --> 6777.44
suddenly they get what i'm saying

6775.199 --> 6780.879999999999
because i'm saying it in their way it's

6777.44 --> 6783.598999999999
so funny how that worked out

6780.88 --> 6786.2390000000005
so yeah i haven't learned spanish but i

6783.599 --> 6786.2390000000005
can speak

6790.84 --> 6795.84
spanglish

6792.56 --> 6799.360000000001
also yeah my best friend in spain there

6795.84 --> 6801.92
he was studying english so

6799.36 --> 6803.679
yeah it's like he's studying english so

6801.92 --> 6806.4800000000005
he's really turned into my best friend

6803.679 --> 6811.84
and he he used me to learn english

6806.48 --> 6811.839999999999
and i was absolutely fine with that

6816.719 --> 6820.2390000000005
and then eventually we just started

6818.56 --> 6825.599
smoking joints and stuff

6820.239 --> 6825.598999999999
in secret and all that

6825.76 --> 6831.280000000001
i could yeah after 15 and then it wasn't

6829.44 --> 6833.678999999999
so much about learning the language

6831.28 --> 6836.639
anymore

6833.679 --> 6836.639
but oh well

6841.599 --> 6847.4400000000005
i assume she's got a start

6845.119 --> 6849.199
got a start learning english in school

6847.44 --> 6852.719
for no

6849.199 --> 6853.678999999999
i got a head start learning english in

6852.719 --> 6856.8
school

6853.679 --> 6860.0
but i learned english from my parents

6856.8 --> 6861.119000000001
and from tv and from the dutch subtitles

6860.0 --> 6863.679
which was the best

6861.119 --> 6864.96
idea ever and now they're taking it all

6863.679 --> 6868.159
away because oh

6864.96 --> 6872.88
dutch voice actors

6868.159 --> 6876.879999999999
yeah i know they won't work too

6872.88 --> 6879.84
but yeah i learned a lot about english

6876.88 --> 6884.0
by hearing english and then reading

6879.84 --> 6884.0
dutch subtitles i learned a lot about it

6886.159 --> 6889.679
i guess that the kids in the newer

6888.639 --> 6892.4800000000005
generations here

6889.679 --> 6894.159
don't have that much of an advantage

6892.48 --> 6895.839999999999
although in general the netherlands is

6894.159 --> 6899.759999999999
always being exposed by

6895.84 --> 6899.76
a lot of english television

6903.199 --> 6906.638999999999
but not just exclusively english by the

6905.76 --> 6919.84
way it's just

6906.639 --> 6919.84
all over the place these days

6928.96 --> 6935.84
a pronoun has pronounce this

6932.719 --> 6935.84
yeah yeah it's it's

6936.56 --> 6939.360000000001
it's something

6940.56 --> 6944.0
anyway i'm not gonna talk spanglish it's

6943.199 --> 6947.839999999999
been a long time

6944.0 --> 6947.84
i would have to hear it again

6948.4 --> 6952.159
i guess that if i would go to spain and

6950.56 --> 6954.96
then start

6952.159 --> 6956.879999999999
asking of the locals to speak english

6954.96 --> 6959.44
i'm either going to be confronted with

6956.88 --> 6961.84
really well english spoken people or

6959.44 --> 6963.678999999999
spanish-speaking spanglish

6961.84 --> 6965.360000000001
and then i'll get used to it again and

6963.679 --> 6966.4
then i would probably be able to copy

6965.36 --> 6968.159
that

6966.4 --> 6970.239
because it's been a long time since i've

6968.159 --> 6975.04
been to spain like a really long

6970.239 --> 6979.36
really really really long time as in

6975.04 --> 6979.36
almost 20 years so

6985.04 --> 6989.84
all right it is trending years yeah

6997.199 --> 7002.159
why do i have to be in welfare well i've

7000.56 --> 7005.679
never really

7002.159 --> 7009.36
managed to get a working life like

7005.679 --> 7012.8
i tried at a certain point but i got

7009.36 --> 7016.5599999999995
really punishing ego

7012.8 --> 7019.84
issues from trying that and at some

7016.56 --> 7019.84
point i just stopped trying

7024.96 --> 7031.84
if i had armor i would look like a

7028.84 --> 7031.84
conquistador

7035.04 --> 7039.679
that's thank you very that's a really

7037.679 --> 7045.84
awesome thing to say

7039.679 --> 7045.84
because they look pretty cool

7056.0 --> 7061.679
just add an o or an a

7059.119 --> 7063.759999999999
to every english word and you're golden

7061.679 --> 7066.8
uh

7063.76 --> 7070.2390000000005
no that's hollywood's

7066.8 --> 7072.8
accent that's something different now

7070.239 --> 7073.839999999999
actual spanglish is very hard to

7072.8 --> 7077.119000000001
understand

7073.84 --> 7080.56
unless you understand why

7077.119 --> 7087.839999999999
they like why they

7080.56 --> 7087.84
why it is so hard to understand

7103.28 --> 7106.96
now it's just like they get all the

7105.36 --> 7109.199
pronunciation like the all the

7106.96 --> 7109.199
uh

7111.92 --> 7116.2390000000005
they get the syllables wrong they get

7114.32 --> 7121.679
the order wrong the rhythm wrong

7116.239 --> 7124.0
that's typically spanglish so english

7121.679 --> 7126.08
speaking and i'm not even gonna do it

7124.0 --> 7130.239
it's embarrassing

7126.08 --> 7130.239
i'm not gonna start it up live

7134.4 --> 7138.799999999999
but yeah by the way like with the

7136.56 --> 7141.599
japanese it's the same

7138.8 --> 7142.400000000001
like japanese english also have a very

7141.599 --> 7144.4800000000005
specific

7142.4 --> 7146.08
way that they typically have trouble

7144.48 --> 7149.36
with speaking english

7146.08 --> 7149.36
and i recognize it

7149.44 --> 7157.839999999999
english english

7153.119 --> 7157.839999999999
is very difficult

7172.639 --> 7177.04
no but they don't they they can't do the

7176.08 --> 7180.719
l

7177.04 --> 7183.28
they turn l's into rs it's very uniquely

7180.719 --> 7183.28
japanese

7185.44 --> 7188.5599999999995
they just can't do the l

7189.36 --> 7192.719
but it's not the only thing it's also

7191.119 --> 7199.839999999999
like just

7192.719 --> 7199.84
the way it rolls off

7203.199 --> 7205.44
right

7211.36 --> 7216.4
as speaky in spanish

7224.84 --> 7227.84
