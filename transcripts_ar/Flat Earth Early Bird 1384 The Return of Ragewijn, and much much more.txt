yesterday

103.979 --> 107.17999999999999
I wasn't doing a show

111.24 --> 116.579
because it was

113.28 --> 118.07900000000001
gray clouded and stormy yesterday and

116.579 --> 122.1
like really

118.079 --> 124.079
I did not feel great I was like so tired

122.1 --> 127.55999999999999
even though I didn't even go to bed that

124.079 --> 132.619
late day before I was just so tired like

127.56 --> 132.619
up until like five in the evening yeah

135.599 --> 141.78
so but yeah today it's really beautiful

138.18 --> 145.98000000000002

141.78 --> 149.04

hello

189.12 --> 196.8
it is Thursday the 6th of October 2022

203.54 --> 208.56
right so yeah

206.22 --> 210.78
no flat Earth early bird show yesterday

208.56 --> 214.28
and no flat Earth debates live yesterday

210.78 --> 217.2
so yeah let's kind of a void but

214.28 --> 219.9
I think today probably is going to be a

217.2 --> 222.89999999999998
live show again hopefully

219.9 --> 222.9
foreign

230.54 --> 234.42
but yeah I had a kind of a day off

233.28 --> 236.22
yesterday

234.42 --> 239.099
because I was just feeling kind of

236.22 --> 242.72
sickly and so tired

239.099 --> 242.72
but today I do feel better

246.0 --> 248.06
um

257.479 --> 262.32
hmm

259.4 --> 265.09999999999997
all right LSG good down here

262.32 --> 265.09999999999997
how are you doing

283.979 --> 288.3
right

286.38 --> 291.3
yeah yesterday a whole bunch of things

288.3 --> 294.06
of course to fill my time somehow

291.3 --> 296.04
but uh

294.06 --> 299.28000000000003
yeah I've been just watching kind of

296.04 --> 301.56
like historical documentaries

299.28 --> 305.29999999999995
on Netflix

301.56 --> 305.3
and that was pretty interesting

305.4 --> 312.44
which one about

307.68 --> 312.44
the long road to World War One

312.9 --> 319.02
I've never actually seen that before and

316.139 --> 320.16
it's so so detailed there's so much

319.02 --> 323.15999999999997
happening

320.16 --> 325.44
so it was really kind of good to

323.16 --> 327.78000000000003
to go through that I might have like

325.44 --> 329.699
gone through it before it was some time

327.78 --> 330.84
when I was much younger and just didn't

329.699 --> 333.18
rub off

330.84 --> 336.539
now I'm getting so much more about it

333.18 --> 339.78000000000003
and it was really such a different

336.539 --> 342.68
the world was so different back then

339.78 --> 346.63899999999995
I mean it was really really different

342.68 --> 346.639
the way things worked

347.039 --> 354.78
like there was much more military

349.46 --> 354.78
influence in general everywhere

356.34 --> 362.4
so yeah that was interesting

360.24 --> 365.699
also watched a little bit little

362.4 --> 367.62
documentary about the Moors

365.699 --> 370.5
history

367.62 --> 372.3
like of Morocco and like how all that

370.5 --> 373.56
build up so yeah I thought that was kind

372.3 --> 375.84000000000003
of a Worthy

373.56 --> 376.62
way to spend my time watching some of

375.84 --> 381.44
that

376.62 --> 381.44
good footage and some basic explanations

382.44 --> 388.94
yeah so that was interesting

386.1 --> 388.94
oh

391.56 --> 395.46
and Laurie's still searching for big

393.78 --> 399.05999999999995

chowing down on Fight The Flat Earth

493.44 --> 499.4
well I think he was on with him uh two

496.86 --> 499.40000000000003
days ago

499.68 --> 503.039
I didn't watch through it because it's

501.84 --> 505.75899999999996
just

503.039 --> 505.759
uh

511.56 --> 516.779
how was Evolution not a fact well what

514.86 --> 519.659
about it is a fact there's nothing about

516.779 --> 521.599
it that's a fact

519.659 --> 524.279
yeah

521.599 --> 528.36
biological evolution

524.279 --> 531.24
is a giant myth and a hoax

528.36 --> 534.0
all the people in history that

531.24 --> 536.76
proclaimed to have proven it were all

534.0 --> 538.8
frauds

536.76 --> 540.8389999999999
because evolution

538.8 --> 544.26
is more driven

540.839 --> 546.6
by an atheist longing like atheist

544.26 --> 552.14
religious longing than it is

546.6 --> 552.14
by any sort of factual's data at all

552.2 --> 557.72

nice

612.11 --> 615.279
[Music]

628.32 --> 630.44
thank you

635.76 --> 639.56
but how are we not

639.6 --> 645.019
what neanderthal

641.88 --> 645.019
what are you talking about

649.68 --> 655.8
and why would you say that we are

652.26 --> 657.98
related you're just presupposing it

655.8 --> 657.9799999999999
foreign

658.1 --> 663.6
related to the gorillas and now we're

661.32 --> 666.1800000000001
relating to the Champions and how are

663.6 --> 667.5790000000001
you related to the earthworms yeah we're

666.18 --> 671.399
not

667.579 --> 673.4399999999999
you're just assuming that you are and

671.399 --> 676.74
then how does that work and it doesn't

673.44 --> 677.839
it never did you just presupposed we all

676.74 --> 681.54
had to

677.839 --> 685.019
originate out of one single cell

681.54 --> 687.3
that's the ridiculous part evolution is

685.019 --> 689.64
just presupposed the entire thing is

687.3 --> 692.3
free supposed there's no evidence for it

689.64 --> 692.3
whatsoever

692.7 --> 699.779
there's no evidence of vestigial organs

697.32 --> 702.3000000000001
suddenly becoming functional

699.779 --> 703.32
it's never that way it's always the

702.3 --> 708.0
opposite

703.32 --> 711.12
yeah always the opposite you have fully

708.0 --> 713.82
functioning things and then suddenly for

711.12 --> 716.4590000000001
some genetic mutation which is a

713.82 --> 719.7
negative thing it doesn't work anymore

716.459 --> 721.4399999999999
and then you have that remnant of

719.7 --> 722.279
something that used to be a functioning

721.44 --> 726.0600000000001
thing

722.279 --> 729.48
because it starts out functioning as per

726.06 --> 733.4399999999999
design and then through entropy over

729.48 --> 736.98
time well it might just not work anymore

733.44 --> 739.339
yeah that's how it works not the other

736.98 --> 739.339
way around

741.959 --> 748.92
I don't know who that is but no

745.079 --> 753.3199999999999
if it relates to Evolution then no

748.92 --> 753.3199999999999
there is no relation

754.44 --> 763.9200000000001
is no ancestral line that links all life

760.32 --> 766.019
together there just isn't it was all

763.92 --> 770.18
separately designed

766.019 --> 775.7
and over time it may have mutated

770.18 --> 775.6999999999999
negatively as in less capable

1527.84 --> 1534.74
every [ __ ] soldier that cooperates

1531.86 --> 1537.279

1534.74 --> 1543.02
executed

1537.279 --> 1546.76
with no hold yeah no hold executed

1543.02 --> 1550.1

1565.88 --> 1571.22
what are you gonna do you should [ __ ]

1568.52 --> 1574.1589999999999
kill those [ __ ] soldiers if they come

1571.22 --> 1578.14
to your house and try to force you to

1574.159 --> 1578.14
get vaccinated you should kill them

1578.299 --> 1584.24

1584.24 --> 1590.1200000000001
[ __ ] neighbors included too

1587.299 --> 1592.76
because if it's just you yeah it's not

1590.12 --> 1594.1999999999998
gonna do a lot right against the whole

1592.76 --> 1598.64
unit

1594.2 --> 1600.679
but if it's just a whole mob of people

1598.64 --> 1603.38
yeah those soldiers what are you gonna

1600.679 --> 1606.279
do you're just gonna literally genocide

1603.38 --> 1606.279
your own people

1606.5 --> 1610.039
you know

1607.94 --> 1612.799
you just got to do that well then you're

1610.039 --> 1615.919
just genocidal maniacs and you should

1612.799 --> 1618.74
all be dead and then people will make

1615.919 --> 1621.26
sure that you are going to be dead

1618.74 --> 1624.82
because there will be no place left for

1621.26 --> 1624.82

your doubt no

1637.279 --> 1642.14
well if somebody's gonna do it right

1639.679 --> 1645.2
that's the whole point if they're gonna

1642.14 --> 1648.5
do it they're [ __ ]

1645.2 --> 1651.38
but they have

1648.5 --> 1654.159
made that supposed law they have

1651.38 --> 1654.159
mandated it

1658.58 --> 1664.539
I've seen that too MC matter

1661.1 --> 1664.539
pissed me off to no end

1677.059 --> 1680.02
foreign

1683.6 --> 1687.62
by the way

1685.34 --> 1690.08
talking like things are getting pretty

1687.62 --> 1693.1589999999999
heated over here as well

1690.08 --> 1693.1589999999999
in the Netherlands

1695.84 --> 1699.34
it's like spreading around

1700.22 --> 1705.74
that basically yeah our government the

1703.76 --> 1708.62
ones that are in control here should be

1705.74 --> 1709.82
arrested and basically

1708.62 --> 1711.5
foreign

1709.82 --> 1714.02
yeah

1711.5 --> 1717.5
become

1714.02 --> 1720.799
subjected to a Tribunal for genocide

1717.5 --> 1725.559
it's like it's becoming real here it's

1720.799 --> 1725.559
it's really this is going to happen

1727.82 --> 1731.539
I think it's really going to happen I

1729.559 --> 1733.8799999999999
don't know what about the other

1731.539 --> 1735.74
countries around us and all that but it

1733.88 --> 1737.6000000000001
seems like the Netherlands is really

1735.74 --> 1741.08
gonna do this

1737.6 --> 1745.1789999999999
and I cannot wait for that

1741.08 --> 1745.1789999999999
hey BJC net good to see you

1770.679 --> 1773.96
violent revolution what are you talking

1772.94 --> 1777.0800000000002
about

1773.96 --> 1779.24
not talking about a violent revolution

1777.08 --> 1783.1399999999999
talking about

1779.24 --> 1785.24
like all the other people including ones

1783.14 --> 1786.6200000000001
that do have power and all that and

1785.24 --> 1791.24
influence

1786.62 --> 1793.4799999999998
are now moving towards discarding this

1791.24 --> 1793.48
government

1797.24 --> 1801.08
yeah it's not a violent revolution I

1800.36 --> 1803.0
mean

1801.08 --> 1807.1
there's going to be a violent revolution

1803.0 --> 1807.1
it's just going to be over very quickly

1807.5 --> 1811.539
that's not gonna last very long

1812.899 --> 1819.7399999999998
but they are these wef

1817.34 --> 1822.9189999999999
yeah conspirators

1819.74 --> 1825.679
they are getting pushed into a corner

1822.919 --> 1827.919
and they are going to be ejected soon I

1825.679 --> 1827.919
feel

1837.02 --> 1841.76

didn't scream for a day I mean

1903.799 --> 1909.9189999999999
I I don't even know what it was like

1906.919 --> 1912.5800000000002
anymore just not having something to do

1909.919 --> 1912.5800000000002

1926.059 --> 1930.94
[ __ ] are you blabbering about your

[ __ ]

1939.98 --> 1942.58
myself

1945.07 --> 1948.1299999999999
[Music]

1979.84 --> 1987.26
but what I think is gonna happen

1983.5 --> 1990.86
is that United States government

1987.26 --> 1995.12
is going to really really reveal itself

1990.86 --> 1997.9399999999998
to be the most evil group of people in

1995.12 --> 2000.399
government that the world has ever seen

1997.94 --> 2002.559
in history

2000.399 --> 2007.1789999999999
because I think that this

2002.559 --> 2009.399
blatant and obvious terrorist attack

2007.179 --> 2012.1000000000001
from the United States on the North

2009.399 --> 2014.9189999999999
stream pipelines is just the start of it

2012.1 --> 2018.84
I think that the American government is

2014.919 --> 2018.8400000000001
actually going to prevent

2018.96 --> 2025.539
Grassroots revolutions from overthrowing

2022.84 --> 2028.779
World economic Forum governments that's

2025.539 --> 2030.94
what I think they will really do

2028.779 --> 2034.179
yeah

2030.94 --> 2037.179
they're that [ __ ] up

2034.179 --> 2040.799
United States is going to reveal itself

2037.179 --> 2044.6200000000001
to be the most evil government anybody

2040.799 --> 2047.08
could ever have imagined

2044.62 --> 2051.839
they're going to be much sicker than

2047.08 --> 2051.839
anybody dared to believe

2052.0 --> 2055.0
foreign

2059.08 --> 2066.179
I think that they will pretty much be

2063.46 --> 2066.179
like

2067.419 --> 2072.52
yeah how would you compare that it's

2069.76 --> 2073.659
like the Soviet Union then the top head

2072.52 --> 2076.24
of it

2073.659 --> 2079.0
just saying like oh no no you cannot

2076.24 --> 2081.1789999999996
have a revolution against this like oh

2079.0 --> 2083.26
the United States is gonna

2081.179 --> 2086.919
help them

2083.26 --> 2089.44
help them against the people

2086.919 --> 2092.7
who are sick of it I think that's what

2089.44 --> 2092.7000000000003
the United States is going to do

2096.22 --> 2100.359
ah okay PG Cruise shank that was taking

2099.28 --> 2104.52
so long

2100.359 --> 2104.52

2123.4 --> 2127.78
that

2124.42 --> 2130.1800000000003
I mean it's your own [ __ ] problem if

2127.78 --> 2132.099
the security goes bad

2130.18 --> 2134.3199999999997
if you turn it off

2132.099 --> 2136.7200000000003

text message

2194.88 --> 2200.7400000000002
twice

2196.619 --> 2204.4
within a minute you think that is normal

2200.74 --> 2207.9399999999996
security PayPal really

2204.4 --> 2210.2200000000003
twice within one minute you think that's

2207.94 --> 2213.28
really necessary

2210.22 --> 2216.3999999999996
from the same IP address every single

2213.28 --> 2219.2200000000003
time since its conception never from any

2216.4 --> 2222.52
other location ever and you need my

2219.22 --> 2223.2999999999997
[ __ ] phone number twice within a

2222.52 --> 2227.28
minute

2223.3 --> 2227.28
what the [ __ ] is wrong with you

2237.52 --> 2243.78
no here we go again I think the exact

2241.0 --> 2247.74
opposite

2243.78 --> 2247.7400000000002
exactly the opposite

2252.04 --> 2259.68
the U.S will prevent the world economic

2256.06 --> 2259.68
Forum from being crushed

2262.66 --> 2271.06
they will keep them in there why because

2267.04 --> 2273.339
they are ultimately against Russia and

2271.06 --> 2276.64
that's it this is just the new [ __ ]

2273.339 --> 2280.599
cold war we're here it's full on their

2276.64 --> 2283.5
way and America is now the [ __ ]

2280.599 --> 2283.5
communist Empire

2284.44 --> 2290.98
and they are pro wef doesn't matter what

2287.8 --> 2294.099
the [ __ ] they say in public they are and

2290.98 --> 2296.079
they're gonna help them because the wef

2294.099 --> 2299.099
is against Russia

2296.079 --> 2299.099
it's that simple

2301.09 --> 2307.98
[Music]

2303.82 --> 2307.98
they are in it yeah of course they are

2308.26 --> 2315.0
by the way I think Putin also went there

2311.44 --> 2315.0
but it doesn't really matter

2315.28 --> 2319.44
because he's not playing into any of it

2322.96 --> 2328.7200000000003
so that's what's gonna happen

2325.3 --> 2330.579
America is just going to abuse its

2328.72 --> 2333.9399999999996
military power

2330.579 --> 2337.0
and it's lies and it's banking [ __ ]

2333.94 --> 2340.14
intimidation politics

2337.0 --> 2343.359
to basically help

2340.14 --> 2345.96
autocrats enslave their public that's

2343.359 --> 2350.2599999999998
what America is going to do spread

2345.96 --> 2353.4
democracy yeah which means exactly the

2350.26 --> 2356.5
opposite as usual destroying democracy

2353.4 --> 2361.3
destroying order and peace

2356.5 --> 2365.099
and creating more [ __ ] and more slavery

2361.3 --> 2365.099
that's what the United States does

2387.339 --> 2392.619
that just did this [ __ ] American

2390.04 --> 2395.74
government needs to end

2392.619 --> 2398.2000000000003
when are you gonna do it America I mean

2395.74 --> 2400.7799999999997
Russia went through that [ __ ] you know

2398.2 --> 2404.64
exactly what happened to them

2400.78 --> 2404.6400000000003
now when are you gonna do it

2406.119 --> 2412.38
you realize that the entire world pretty

2409.48 --> 2415.3
much exclusively hates you America

2412.38 --> 2416.52
because of this [ __ ] government of

2415.3 --> 2420.76
yours

2416.52 --> 2422.92
exclusively yeah without that [ __ ]

2420.76 --> 2425.38

they don't they hate you they hate you

2429.52 --> 2434.2599999999998

2432.28 --> 2437.5
the worst [ __ ] government in human

2434.26 --> 2441.28
history sitting on top of you like

2437.5 --> 2445.06
reaping everything you got just to nag

people in Russia that actually also

3009.54 --> 3012.14
oh

3022.44 --> 3025.28
uh

3037.14 --> 3042.72
yeah media portraying Ukraine like the

3040.44 --> 3045.119
pillar of democracy I think there should

3042.72 --> 3048.0589999999997
be a vast

3045.119 --> 3051.1800000000003
mass arrest

3048.059 --> 3053.6600000000003
of these [ __ ] media people

3051.18 --> 3053.66
yeah

3053.76 --> 3062.7000000000003
for basically being Nazi conspirators I

3058.02 --> 3066.119
mean technically that's not off

3062.7 --> 3068.7599999999998
that's actually real I think that these

3066.119 --> 3071.579
people in media everywhere

3068.76 --> 3073.559
throughout the world but especially in

3071.579 --> 3075.3590000000004
Europe and especially in the United

3073.559 --> 3076.92
States although you know where it is

3075.359 --> 3080.7599999999998
there right

3076.92 --> 3085.14
I think they should be arrested

3080.76 --> 3086.7200000000003
literally for conspiring with known

3085.14 --> 3092.9
proven

3086.72 --> 3096.859
militant Nazis they should be arrested

3092.9 --> 3096.859
that's what I really think

3097.619 --> 3102.119
because these people in media that

3100.02 --> 3104.94
promote this [ __ ] and that say that

3102.119 --> 3106.5
Ukraine is such a great loving place and

3104.94 --> 3108.66
you should go there and send them

3106.5 --> 3113.66
everything and make your government give

3108.66 --> 3113.66
them money yeah they should be arrested

3114.059 --> 3121.5
for conspiring with known militant Nazis

3129.24 --> 3137.64
and I mean arrested arrested I mean

3133.88 --> 3142.559

potential executions of media people

in known history you understand

also it is the largest quantity

incontrovertible fact gas is a lot more

3632.4 --> 3636.42
there was this thing I don't know if any

3634.92 --> 3638.099
of you remember that it was in the late

3636.42 --> 3640.7400000000002
90s I think

3638.099 --> 3643.44
what's this warning like there's a Giant

3640.74 --> 3648.2
Gas field found

3643.44 --> 3651.299
and if the if global warming

3648.2 --> 3653.66
yeah the then the ice might melt and

3651.299 --> 3657.059
then the gas could escape and literally

3653.66 --> 3659.46
choke all life on Earth that's what they

3657.059 --> 3662.099
said back then yeah

3659.46 --> 3666.54
well they took care of it

3662.099 --> 3669.48
they've actually basically started to

3666.54 --> 3671.7
tap it pump the gas out before that

3669.48 --> 3674.46
could happen

3671.7 --> 3676.4399999999996
I'm pretty sure that that thing is

3674.46 --> 3679.98
actually the biggest gas field in the

3676.44 --> 3682.799
world and not the pocket in Iran

3679.98 --> 3685.079
although maybe that one is just really

3682.799 --> 3687.059
big too

3685.079 --> 3689.7200000000003
but I've never even really heard of that

3687.059 --> 3689.7200000000003
before so

3694.68 --> 3697.7999999999997
[Music]

3699.98 --> 3706.319
right anyway thanks for the geological

3703.579 --> 3708.98
data point there George Sanford

3706.319 --> 3708.98
appreciated

3725.299 --> 3730.5
what we're just gonna launch our Dart

3728.46 --> 3732.359
and if your pipeline gets hit it's your

3730.5 --> 3736.64
own what

3732.359 --> 3736.64
very creative but nonsensical

3741.119 --> 3746.1600000000003
still waiting for global warming well

3743.28 --> 3748.8190000000004
you're gonna have to wait for like six

3746.16 --> 3748.819
months then

3749.16 --> 3753.839
because yeah first we're gonna have to

3752.04 --> 3756.77
go to through the winter and after that

3753.839 --> 3758.18
it will be warming again

3756.77 --> 3762.44
[Music]

3758.18 --> 3762.44
there's global warming every year

3762.72 --> 3768.6499999999996
it's called spring and summer

3829.16 --> 3835.689
[Music]

3843.599 --> 3846.1400000000003
okay

3853.68 --> 3859.74
all right what was I talking about

3856.92 --> 3861.66
I think I've been mostly just being very

3859.74 --> 3864.3799999999997
loud and [ __ ]

3861.66 --> 3864.3799999999997
uh

3864.42 --> 3870.78
yeah but I hate these [ __ ]

3866.94 --> 3873.599
propagandists I hate them so much

3870.78 --> 3876.2000000000003
I mean these propagandists and their

3873.599 --> 3878.9
ridiculous little mental Ponzi scheme

3876.2 --> 3882.14
are literally

3878.9 --> 3884.76
destroying my country and Europe

3882.14 --> 3887.52
literally destroying them

3884.76 --> 3890.599
I mean this [ __ ] is gonna have such a

3887.52 --> 3890.599
horrific blowback

3891.18 --> 3896.04
I mean I really hope that these [ __ ]

3893.72 --> 3898.02
propagandists all eventually end up

3896.04 --> 3900.96
killing themselves because they [ __ ]

3898.02 --> 3903.48
deserve it for what's gonna happen they

3900.96 --> 3904.68
absolutely deserve to [ __ ] kill

3903.48 --> 3906.299
themselves

3904.68 --> 3908.2799999999997
because of what's going to happen

3906.299 --> 3911.54
because of them

3908.28 --> 3915.119
purely because of them and their stupid

3911.54 --> 3918.599
blabbermouth ill thought out plan

3915.119 --> 3923.099
[ __ ] [ __ ] imperialists making

3918.599 --> 3925.76
mistakes that General's 200 years ago

3923.099 --> 3930.059
admitted was ridiculous okay

3925.76 --> 3934.8590000000004
200 years ago generals wanted to do

3930.059 --> 3938.2200000000003
similar [ __ ] and they All Cried Out

3934.859 --> 3941.64
and basically said [ __ ] I was so wrong

3938.22 --> 3947.0
about this I was so wrong and now these

3941.64 --> 3947.0
retards out there are doing it again

3948.24 --> 3952.7299999999996
[Music]

3953.88 --> 3958.7000000000003
yeah that's just a truck

3955.98 --> 3958.7

foreign

3979.54 --> 3982.619
[Music]

4019.28 --> 4025.52
I think watching that documentary long

4022.28 --> 4028.4
road to war really got to be in a way

4025.52 --> 4031.7
I got so much spiritual metadata from

4028.4 --> 4034.46
that because there was so much footage

4031.7 --> 4037.7599999999998
which is pretty incredible by the way

4034.46 --> 4042.02
considering the era

4037.76 --> 4045.8590000000004
I mean there was elaborate photography

4042.02 --> 4048.68
like even in the entire 19th century

4045.859 --> 4052.64
and before

4048.68 --> 4055.3999999999996
I think if I were to believe

4052.64 --> 4058.18
what I was seeing

4055.4 --> 4058.1800000000003
and

4064.24 --> 4068.4799999999996
like

4065.9 --> 4071.2000000000003
it was all just dominance games back

4068.48 --> 4071.2
then I mean

4072.02 --> 4078.619
in this age there's such a big

4075.26 --> 4080.78
like mentality shift like nothing works

4078.619 --> 4083.48
like that anymore

4080.78 --> 4085.8190000000004
but they're still trying to like push

4083.48 --> 4088.46
that sort of thinking through like

4085.819 --> 4090.5589999999997
they're trying to regain the Reigns as

4088.46 --> 4092.42
general and put everybody back in the

4090.559 --> 4097.1
soldier boots

4092.42 --> 4098.96
like it like it used to be 200 years ago

4097.1 --> 4102.4400000000005
I think it just feels like that's what

4098.96 --> 4105.02
they're doing but it's ridiculous

4102.44 --> 4108.379999999999
and it's just destructive it doesn't

4105.02 --> 4112.160000000001
help anybody but people that like to

4108.38 --> 4114.38
exploit War that's the only people it

4112.16 --> 4118.46
helps it doesn't help anything there's

4114.38 --> 4120.08
no need for like Industrial Revolution

4118.46 --> 4122.4800000000005
or anything

4120.08 --> 4124.4
right it's like oh all this old [ __ ]

4122.48 --> 4127.5199999999995
yeah it's so outdated they're so much

4124.4 --> 4129.62
better now oh if a war blows it up well

4127.52 --> 4133.160000000001
it's just a good opportunity to rebuild

4129.62 --> 4135.92
it all updated yet no no there is no

4133.16 --> 4138.08
such situation

4135.92 --> 4139.88
it just isn't

4138.08 --> 4143.179
everything that's going to be destroyed

4139.88 --> 4144.319
by Warren out is just destruction that's

4143.179 --> 4147.56
it

4144.319 --> 4149.719
it's just damage it's just gonna be a

4147.56 --> 4151.819
lot of grappling of all this freaking

4149.719 --> 4154.819
War exploiters

4151.819 --> 4157.0
that's it that's the only thing it helps

4154.819 --> 4157.0
now

4174.739 --> 4177.459999999999
what

4177.679 --> 4182.06
no here we go again it has nothing to do

4180.199 --> 4185.299
with it

4182.06 --> 4188.859
I mean Broadband is cable it's a cable

4185.299 --> 4188.859
5G is Wireless

4191.179 --> 4195.64
there's nothing to do with one another

4192.98 --> 4195.639999999999
at all

4202.46 --> 4207.699
2G oh good I'd keep it that way

4214.1 --> 4219.17

4333.32 --> 4341.0599999999995
in the Netherlands apparently

4336.64 --> 4344.84
Retta this [ __ ] [ __ ] at the top

4341.06 --> 4346.88
just officially denied or in some debate

4344.84 --> 4350.78
denied that

4346.88 --> 4354.32
like no no no no no America did not blow

4350.78 --> 4357.259999999999
up Nordstrom no no no no

4354.32 --> 4360.099999999999

holding something back Rita

4363.08 --> 4370.78
did you do it you [ __ ] [ __ ]

4367.699 --> 4370.78
did you do it

4370.88 --> 4376.159000000001
because otherwise I cannot imagine why

4374.36 --> 4379.28
you'd say that America wouldn't have

4376.159 --> 4382.9
done it since they literally announced

4379.28 --> 4382.9
that they would do that

4383.42 --> 4386.26
uh

4391.82 --> 4394.54

4428.179 --> 4434.92

five minute delay or something

4456.8 --> 4459.46

[Music]

4472.04 --> 4476.9

4552.38 --> 4558.26

is basically just dousing you in

4560.36 --> 4564.88
radiation and just

4562.06 --> 4567.46
completely derailing your

4564.88 --> 4570.02
microbiological hormonal system

4567.46 --> 4570.92
functions that's what it's really good

4570.02 --> 4573.679
at

4570.92 --> 4575.78
it's not even that fast it's only fast

4573.679 --> 4578.0
in certain locations where you get

4575.78 --> 4579.92
radiated as much

4578.0 --> 4581.96
so

4579.92 --> 4585.14
yeah

4581.96 --> 4587.0
look if you just want fast download

4585.14 --> 4590.900000000001
speed

4587.0 --> 4595.88
I don't want to wait so long

4590.9 --> 4597.339999999999
plug it in your goddamn [ __ ] just plug

4595.88 --> 4603.1990000000005
it in

4597.34 --> 4605.54
in a socket in a wall with a wire it's

4603.199 --> 4608.78
all super fast and you're not gonna get

4605.54 --> 4614.54
doused in radiation I mean you don't

4608.78 --> 4616.759999999999
need 5G nobody ever needs 5G nobody

4614.54 --> 4619.88
needs it I mean I've been saying this

4616.76 --> 4622.88
for three years nobody needs it only a

4619.88 --> 4625.400000000001
bunch of goddamn dumbass yuppies that

4622.88 --> 4627.32
are lazy as [ __ ] don't know what the

[Music]

4655.82 --> 4659.96
what

4657.14 --> 4662.679
what are you talking about a man like me

4659.96 --> 4662.679
what

4665.12 --> 4669.62
like what the hell are you talking about

4667.52 --> 4672.7390000000005
in general I don't even know what you're

4669.62 --> 4674.659
talking about gas gas where oh do we

4672.739 --> 4678.259999999999
know it what what are you talking about

4674.659 --> 4681.92
where and what are you talking about

4678.26 --> 4685.179
seems completely random

4681.92 --> 4685.179
what are you talking about

4685.219 --> 4689.719
what gas where talking about Russia you

4688.28 --> 4692.78
talk where

4689.719 --> 4695.56
you mean the north stream too is that

4692.78 --> 4695.5599999999995
what you're talking about

4701.78 --> 4706.42
yeah I wouldn't light a match there if I

4704.0 --> 4706.42
were you

4707.06 --> 4712.46
pretty sure you will be able to smell

4709.1 --> 4714.92
that it is like butane or whatever it is

4712.46 --> 4717.32
I don't know I think you'll be able to

4714.92 --> 4720.26
smell that pretty easily at a distance

4717.32 --> 4722.5599999999995
you don't need to light a match to do

4720.26 --> 4722.56
that

4723.86 --> 4726.699
foreign

4733.239 --> 4738.98
it's just damage I mean they've already

4736.64 --> 4743.2390000000005
in Russia has already announced that

4738.98 --> 4746.659
they can repair it relatively quickly

4743.239 --> 4749.12
it's actually easier than you think

4746.659 --> 4752.0599999999995
to repair it

4749.12 --> 4753.8
all they need to do is just replace a

4752.06 --> 4756.320000000001
pipe segment and they've got a really

4753.8 --> 4758.96
good system for this

4756.32 --> 4760.5199999999995
so it can be repaired a lot quicker than

4758.96 --> 4763.46
you might think

4760.52 --> 4765.9800000000005
but that's not even the issue the issue

4763.46 --> 4767.719
is that it's just like a declaration of

4765.98 --> 4770.839999999999
war

4767.719 --> 4773.06
doing that blowing it up that's the

4770.84 --> 4775.82
egregious part not that it's all it's

4773.06 --> 4777.38
irreparable no it is repairable it's

4775.82 --> 4782.5599999999995
just

4777.38 --> 4782.56
so bad that that was done

4791.12 --> 4793.96
foreign

4794.32 --> 4802.54
smelling gas well I bet the

4797.96 --> 4802.54
a whole bunch of people what is it

4805.1 --> 4811.219
north of in North part of Poland and

4807.98 --> 4814.299999999999
maybe some over at Denmark I think that

4811.219 --> 4814.3
they'll be smelling it

4821.96 --> 4824.14
foreign

4830.02 --> 4837.5
it's just it's an aggravated insult on

4835.1 --> 4840.1990000000005
intelligence in general to say this [ __ ]

4837.5 --> 4842.659
yeah why the hell would Russia do that

4840.199 --> 4845.839999999999
they haven't even

4842.659 --> 4847.42
like set anything up I mean it's not

4845.84 --> 4851.2390000000005
like they're

4847.42 --> 4853.58
reichstag moment or anything like what

4851.239 --> 4856.04
do you how do you call that uh

4853.58 --> 4857.84
they they weren't looking for an excuse

4856.04 --> 4860.06
to attack and that's why they could have

4857.84 --> 4861.14
done that right well they didn't it's

4860.06 --> 4863.719
just like

4861.14 --> 4866.54
no if we wanted to use some stupid

4863.719 --> 4868.04
bargaining chip could you just turn it

4866.54 --> 4869.72
off

there's absolutely no logical

4878.78 --> 4885.62
conceivable reason to do that whatsoever

they completely build it themselves why

4885.62 --> 4891.62
would they do that

4887.06 --> 4894.080000000001
why makes no sense you cannot argue

4891.62 --> 4896.44
in any logical way why they would have

4902.14 --> 4907.1

4907.1 --> 4911.659000000001
what Russia is probably going to do is

4909.44 --> 4914.599999999999
basically put a little bit more pressure

4911.659 --> 4915.86
on Germany as in okay we are gonna

4914.6 --> 4919.280000000001
repair it

that might happen

4938.0 --> 4942.679
or

4939.56 --> 4946.64
because I mean Germany is not gonna buy

4942.679 --> 4949.28
this ex insanely expensive gas from the

4946.64 --> 4951.26
United States especially like

4949.28 --> 4953.719
in the sense that they cannot afford

4951.26 --> 4956.42
that like not even just with their

4953.719 --> 4958.84
printing of money like that's not gonna

work

foreign everything

4967.34 --> 4971.360000000001

4969.38 --> 4974.659000000001
if they want that well good luck with

5026.14 --> 5029.8

I mean you have to for safety reasons

5070.659 --> 5075.339999999999
like basically as soon as it comes out

5073.719 --> 5078.34
of the ground and is

5075.34 --> 5080.8
getting stored in tankers they're gonna

5078.34 --> 5084.719
add that smell thing to it because it's

5080.8 --> 5084.719
just super dangerous without it

right

so I'm pretty damn sure that it's gonna

5091.12 --> 5096.099999999999
have that weird smell thing added to the

5101.02 --> 5108.06
do that for well the before mentioned

5458.739 --> 5463.199
who's going to be the Independent party

5466.239 --> 5469.178999999999
there in the world that it that that

5468.1 --> 5471.280000000001
happened

5469.179 --> 5473.62
except for you

5471.28 --> 5476.88
because you what drag the dog and now

5473.62 --> 5476.88
you think everything is fake

5481.48 --> 5487.299999999999
yeah that's called solipsism

5485.139 --> 5490.54
when you think absolutely Aries

5487.3 --> 5494.5
everything is fake that's solipsism

5490.54 --> 5497.139
you're wrong not everything is fake and

5494.5 --> 5498.94
usually when something is fake you'll

5497.139 --> 5500.9800000000005
figure it out

5498.94 --> 5503.5599999999995
because things that are faked out there

5500.98 --> 5506.5599999999995
are usually faked

5503.56 --> 5509.139
for the Heat of the Moment

5506.56 --> 5511.42
push everybody in a very specific

5509.139 --> 5513.9400000000005
Direction that's why they fake things

5511.42 --> 5516.76
right on the precipice of when things

5513.94 --> 5520.0599999999995
are starting to unroll yeah

5516.76 --> 5522.04
that's not this this is not that there's

5520.06 --> 5525.820000000001
nothing unrolling

5522.04 --> 5528.34
it's just a jab just like that there out

5525.82 --> 5530.92
of nowhere what's unrolling nothing

5528.34 --> 5534.1
nothing is unrolling there's no reason

5530.92 --> 5537.76
to fake it you see

5534.1 --> 5543.6990000000005
the only fake things if they can use it

5537.76 --> 5548.38
right there right then to push People In

5543.699 --> 5551.919999999999
the Heat of the Moment that's the only

5548.38 --> 5553.42
reason they do that you see the only

5551.92 --> 5556.9
reason

5553.42 --> 5559.659
if that's not the situation there's no

5556.9 --> 5562.54
reason to even think that it's been fake

5559.659 --> 5566.32
no reason at all because faking things

5562.54 --> 5570.76
is very troublesome

5566.32 --> 5573.88
it gives more problems than it solves

5570.76 --> 5576.820000000001
so they don't do that unless it's in the

5573.88 --> 5579.52
heat of a moment and they need that

5576.82 --> 5581.739
extra push and then they'll figure it

5579.52 --> 5584.4400000000005
out later it's fake doesn't matter

5581.739 --> 5586.54
anymore because they just did it for the

5584.44 --> 5587.5599999999995
push well there's nothing being pushed

5586.54 --> 5590.08
right now

5587.56 --> 5591.76
so it's not fake there's no reason to

5590.08 --> 5594.46
fake it at all

5591.76 --> 5596.139
this is not a Wag the Dog situation if

5594.46 --> 5598.9
you think everything is a whack the dog

5596.139 --> 5600.9400000000005
situation you're just a solipsist you

5598.9 --> 5602.98
think everything is fake now

5600.94 --> 5604.36
yeah that's your problem it's not

5602.98 --> 5607.239
realistic

5604.36 --> 5610.599999999999
people and governments don't fake things

5607.239 --> 5613.659
just because whatever

5610.6 --> 5616.42
they do it for very specific reasons and

5613.659 --> 5617.92
it always has to do with the Heat of the

5616.42 --> 5620.32
Moment

5617.92 --> 5623.1990000000005
if there is no such Heat of the Moment

5620.32 --> 5628.0199999999995
there's no reason to do it because it

5623.199 --> 5628.0199999999995
brings more trouble than it solves

5642.04 --> 5648.219
there there's no Heat of the Moment

5656.26 --> 5660.04
happening

5657.4 --> 5661.599999999999
it's not fake because there's no reason

5660.04 --> 5664.44
to fake it

5661.6 --> 5664.4400000000005
you get it

5667.54 --> 5671.56
I mean this is like the fourth time I've

5669.34 --> 5674.02
tried to explain this to you now

5671.56 --> 5677.76
either you get it or you don't and you

5674.02 --> 5677.76
keep on dwelling in your delusion

5685.679 --> 5689.92
there is no Heat of the Moment a man

5688.06 --> 5693.219
like Heat of the Moment is not about

5689.92 --> 5695.56
behind the scenes it's about in front of

the scenes it's about the world stage

5695.56 --> 5701.820000000001
it's not about behind the scenes you

5698.32 --> 5704.5
don't fake things to make things roll

you sabotage things real things for

5743.82 --> 5749.259999999999

5747.04 --> 5750.699
bunch of strategical thinking yesterdays

5749.26 --> 5752.92
because of that

5750.699 --> 5755.919999999999
the road to war

5752.92 --> 5755.92
documentary

5756.4 --> 5760.299999999999
which was like two hours by the way

5758.139 --> 5762.639
really intense

5760.3 --> 5765.04
but yeah that absolutely made me think

5762.639 --> 5766.54
because they revealed this sort of thing

5765.04 --> 5769.719
there it's like

5766.54 --> 5772.42
big tactics how do you do it how do they

5769.719 --> 5775.96
plan it is so much information in that

5772.42 --> 5777.219
documentary it's pretty inspiring and I

5775.96 --> 5779.62
learned a lot

5777.219 --> 5783.12
and I got it freshly absorbed so I'm

5779.62 --> 5783.12
applying it right here right now

5783.34 --> 5786.9400000000005
and yeah these are the things that you

5785.38 --> 5789.78
don't fake something

5786.94 --> 5792.28
for no reason you only do it

5789.78 --> 5794.44
to get a push

5792.28 --> 5796.719
in that moment because something is

5794.44 --> 5799.12
about to unroll and you needed that

5796.719 --> 5800.92
extra push and then afterward doesn't

5799.12 --> 5802.84
matter anymore if it's a lie because

5800.92 --> 5805.06
everybody will recognize yeah okay it

5802.84 --> 5808.4800000000005
was just a push then they'll forget

5805.06 --> 5811.06
about it there's nothing happening

5808.48 --> 5813.638999999999
nothing is unrolling you're going to

5811.06 --> 5815.38
fake it it's just gonna bring more

5813.639 --> 5818.679
trouble than it's gonna solve because

5815.38 --> 5821.02
then there is no afterward response from

5818.679 --> 5822.9400000000005
people like oh yeah yeah we are right in

5821.02 --> 5825.040000000001
the middle of a war about to happen so

5822.94 --> 5827.0199999999995
yeah we get it no no there is no such

5825.04 --> 5829.719
thing happened so they'll be like why

5827.02 --> 5831.9400000000005
the [ __ ] did this just get fake why did

5829.719 --> 5834.94

you don't like real geopolitical

5886.719 --> 5891.699
need to wander or a Ponder or research

5889.36 --> 5893.92
why something is fake you can simply

5891.699 --> 5896.919999999999
figure out whether it could be fake or

5893.92 --> 5899.26

you can immediately know whether it

5903.34 --> 5909.28
could have been faked or not immediately

5906.04 --> 5911.139
by the action that follows it up

5909.28 --> 5914.0199999999995
do you understand that

do you understand how valuable it is to

really

5965.98 --> 5971.0199999999995

what

5990.52 --> 5993.780000000001
that's fraud

5998.8 --> 6006.3
I mean the whole point of this supposed

6001.139 --> 6008.88
peer review is they don't trust you they

6006.3 --> 6011.6990000000005
test it

6008.88 --> 6013.8
why the hell

6011.699 --> 6017.159
would you just

6013.8 --> 6019.9800000000005
like barter say I'm gonna trust your

hope you're doing better than yesterday

6056.639 --> 6061.62

6059.46 --> 6064.88
yesterday

6061.62 --> 6064.88
I hope it's better now

6072.48 --> 6077.218999999999
good to hear

6074.3 --> 6080.04
yeah I'm much better too [ __ ] rage win

6077.219 --> 6081.96
but hey rage bin is better than just

6080.04 --> 6083.4
being freaking exhausted all the time

6081.96 --> 6086.04
just like

6083.4 --> 6089.04
I'm just gonna sit here look really

6086.04 --> 6091.0199999999995
tired for like 15 minutes consider

6089.04 --> 6093.36
whether I'm gonna say something or not

6091.02 --> 6095.280000000001
every few minutes and then just not say

6093.36 --> 6097.199
anything because I feel too exhausted

6095.28 --> 6098.4
yeah that would have been the show

6097.199 --> 6100.739
yesterday

6098.4 --> 6105.179
and that's why I didn't do it

6100.739 --> 6106.678999999999
today I do not feel that way

6105.179 --> 6111.06
I feel

6106.679 --> 6114.5
very energetic and very forward

6111.06 --> 6114.5
and that makes for a good show

6114.719 --> 6119.659
and yeah return away rage wins uh

6119.76 --> 6125.84
yeah but passion I I I'm always

6122.58 --> 6125.84
passionate with good reason

6126.6 --> 6131.42
I do not allow it to manifest without it

6131.699 --> 6134.239
foreign

6148.4 --> 6154.199
is is that

6150.78 --> 6156.0
a surgeon that performs complicated

6154.199 --> 6159.599999999999
operations

6156.0 --> 6162.719
has already done it and can have that

6159.6 --> 6165.06
proof that they done that and then the

6162.719 --> 6167.34
information can be reviewed and then

6165.06 --> 6171.0
there's agencies that can actually keep

6167.34 --> 6174.0
track of somebody's performance and then

6171.0 --> 6177.84
you can just cross-reference it based on

6174.0 --> 6181.199
what they've already performed as

6177.84 --> 6183.2390000000005
yeah because they have the results

6181.199 --> 6185.58
yeah if someone is going to come up to

6183.239 --> 6187.619
you and say like yeah man I'm gonna do

6185.58 --> 6191.88
this heart surgery thing I know I can

6187.619 --> 6193.38
like do it in one go the first time and

6191.88 --> 6194.46
I'll succeed

6193.38 --> 6197.9400000000005
yeah

6194.46 --> 6199.679
now that would be freaky if you say like

6197.94 --> 6202.44
well

6199.679 --> 6207.26
you seem to know your theory about heart

6202.44 --> 6207.259999999999
surgery so I'll just take you then

6207.61 --> 6210.83
[Music]

6211.56 --> 6215.42
very weird thing to say

6217.86 --> 6220.46
foreign

6227.6 --> 6233.280000000001
no we were we were actually talking

6230.699 --> 6234.419999999999
about something new

6233.28 --> 6237.0
right

6234.42 --> 6238.9800000000005
because what the [ __ ] is the point of a

6237.0 --> 6241.619
peer review

6238.98 --> 6243.718999999999
if it's already something that's

6241.619 --> 6246.719
established

6243.719 --> 6248.76
why would you peer review it then it's

6246.719 --> 6250.679
already established why would you peer

6248.76 --> 6252.06
review it's already been established why

6250.679 --> 6254.28
would you peer review it it's already

6252.06 --> 6257.820000000001
been established that makes no sense

6254.28 --> 6259.5
that nullifies the entire theoretical

6257.82 --> 6262.0199999999995
setup then

6259.5 --> 6263.82
it's pointless then why would you peer

6262.02 --> 6266.4800000000005
review something that's already been

6263.82 --> 6266.48
established

6266.76 --> 6273.5

6269.46 --> 6273.5
yourself to all hell there

6273.73 --> 6276.959999999999
[Music]

6279.42 --> 6282.42
what is the new thing I don't care I

6281.219 --> 6284.159
don't even know what they were talking

6282.42 --> 6286.56
about they were just talking about how

6284.159 --> 6289.5599999999995
freaking peer review is because of what

6286.56 --> 6291.659000000001
Professor Phil Bell said most ridiculous

6289.56 --> 6292.92
statement I've ever heard him say in

6291.659 --> 6295.5199999999995
relation to this

6292.92 --> 6295.52
that

6295.98 --> 6303.119
you can literally bargain with another

6299.52 --> 6306.3
scientist you trust my science I'll

6303.119 --> 6308.639
Trust yours yeah that's what he said

6306.3 --> 6311.639
it's literally what he said I mean

6308.639 --> 6316.56
that's pretty much fraud that's like

6311.639 --> 6317.900000000001
conspiracy to not perform science and

6316.56 --> 6322.4400000000005
just

6317.9 --> 6325.0199999999995
push it through I mean that's fraud it's

6322.44 --> 6328.08
just fraud if you do that I mean if you

6325.02 --> 6330.06
review something as a pair and you don't

6328.08 --> 6333.3
actually test anything about it

6330.06 --> 6336.179
including its science then that's not

6333.3 --> 6337.38
really a peer review that's just fraud

6336.179 --> 6340.38
then

6337.38 --> 6340.38
foreign

6341.0 --> 6344.039
[Music]

6347.06 --> 6352.04
let me quote him exactly then

6357.619 --> 6364.259999999999
if I expect other scientists to trust my

6361.679 --> 6367.4400000000005
work why

6364.26 --> 6369.679
should they not expect me to trust

6367.44 --> 6371.759999999999
theirs

6369.679 --> 6375.86
so yeah

6371.76 --> 6379.4400000000005
I think my paraphrasing of his statement

6375.86 --> 6384.86
is really not that far off I pretty much

6379.44 --> 6384.86
gave you the spirit of it in what I said

6388.26 --> 6393.6
provided we both subject our work to

6391.139 --> 6396.119
peer review yeah no but that's still a

6393.6 --> 6400.38
conspiracy

6396.119 --> 6403.199
to trust somebody's work is to not test

6400.38 --> 6405.4800000000005
it then the whole point of peer

6403.199 --> 6408.36
reviewing is that you test it if you're

6405.48 --> 6409.678999999999
gonna trust them it's like oh no we can

6408.36 --> 6412.5599999999995
trust each other

6409.679 --> 6414.84
so then you're going to be biased and

6412.56 --> 6417.3
basically friendly and think like oh

6414.84 --> 6418.8
yeah yeah I'm just gonna support that

6417.3 --> 6420.719
thing that he does so you're not

6418.8 --> 6422.34
actually gonna test it and test whether

6420.719 --> 6423.3
it's wrong because you're gonna trust

6422.34 --> 6426.0
him

6423.3 --> 6429.0
this is wrong Professor Phil Bell

6426.0 --> 6431.82
this is just wrong it's conspiracy it's

6429.0 --> 6434.94
conspiracy to do that

6431.82 --> 6436.5599999999995
fraud it's a conspiracy and a fraud to

6434.94 --> 6438.78
do that

6436.56 --> 6441.02
you don't test everything every day yeah

6438.78 --> 6444.9
but if you're gonna pair with you

6441.02 --> 6447.06
somebody's work you are

6444.9 --> 6449.42
yeah and that's what we were talking

6447.06 --> 6449.42
about

6454.26 --> 6459.360000000001
I trust the medicine my doctor gives me

6456.48 --> 6461.04
okay well in that case I'll give you

6459.36 --> 6465.679
another five years and then you'll

6461.04 --> 6465.679
probably be dead so good luck with that

6481.52 --> 6487.5
but maybe the placebo effect will carry

6485.58 --> 6489.48
you through it does for some people

6487.5 --> 6492.8
apparently

6489.48 --> 6492.799999999999
I don't know I don't care

6495.0 --> 6499.04
trusting medication is for idiots

6531.44 --> 6534.919999999999
how would you know

6536.46 --> 6539.54
how would you know that

6542.239 --> 6547.5599999999995
I mean you trust you trust that they've

6545.58 --> 6549.42
saved your life because you did what

6547.56 --> 6551.34
they say and you're still alive so you

6549.42 --> 6553.92
just trusted them how do you know that

6551.34 --> 6557.78
you would have died if you didn't do

6553.92 --> 6557.78
what they said how do you know that

6560.46 --> 6562.76
yeah

6562.8 --> 6568.1990000000005
do you know

6565.5 --> 6570.96
did you figure out your condition and

6568.199 --> 6574.199
exactly what happens based on the actual

6570.96 --> 6577.7390000000005
medical research in there or did you

6574.199 --> 6580.5199999999995
just blindly trust your doctor like a

6577.739 --> 6580.5199999999995
good cheaper

6580.98 --> 6588.0599999999995
is that did that doctor also tell you to

6584.219 --> 6591.9
take the corona vaccity she

6588.06 --> 6594.080000000001
or were you wise enough to bypass on

6591.9 --> 6594.08
that

6595.4 --> 6601.619
several opinions that I had only one

6598.26 --> 6604.7390000000005
year to live oh yes oh of course and

6601.619 --> 6607.139
that's always super reliable

6604.739 --> 6609.119
I mean it's not like they're always

6607.139 --> 6613.139
wrong

6609.119 --> 6616.699
or most of the time wrong

6613.139 --> 6619.4400000000005
yeah hey hey professor Phil Bell yeah

6616.699 --> 6622.678999999999
let's just talk in general

6619.44 --> 6624.78
how many times do doctors tell somebody

6622.679 --> 6627.0
oh you have this long to live because of

6624.78 --> 6630.3
your condition and then it actually

6627.0 --> 6631.619
comes true when they retract from the

6630.3 --> 6634.04
medical system

6631.619 --> 6634.04
huh

6635.34 --> 6640.38
one example

6638.4 --> 6643.5
I'd love to hear about it

6640.38 --> 6645.02
because every person that I've heard of

6643.5 --> 6648.179
that have

6645.02 --> 6650.400000000001
retracted from the medical system after

6648.179 --> 6652.5
the doctor just brutally declared you're

6650.4 --> 6656.699
going to die

6652.5 --> 6658.92
they tend to end up living

6656.699 --> 6662.239
there's a lot of those stories about

6658.92 --> 6664.9800000000005
people that did that and they didn't die

6662.239 --> 6670.04
I've heard so many of these stories

6664.98 --> 6670.04
throughout my life it's surreal yeah

6671.04 --> 6676.92
because it's all [ __ ]

6673.739 --> 6679.08
they don't know that they say these

6676.92 --> 6680.76
things based on stupid models they have

6679.08 --> 6684.0599999999995
no idea what the [ __ ] they're talking

6680.76 --> 6687.860000000001
about because it's models based on

6684.06 --> 6687.860000000001
pseudoscience and fraud

6688.92 --> 6694.4400000000005
it's all just a bunch of allopathic

6691.76 --> 6696.6
machinist thinking they don't actually

6694.44 --> 6699.78
know what the [ __ ] they're doing

6696.6 --> 6702.119000000001
they're just machines following these

6699.78 --> 6704.46
routines they don't know what it is

6702.119 --> 6706.619
they're just blabbering they're just

6704.46 --> 6709.56
telling you oh according to the stats

6706.619 --> 6712.139
you should die then unless you do this

6709.56 --> 6713.580000000001
and that you really think that well if

6712.139 --> 6717.6
you really think that they're right

6713.58 --> 6720.0
guess what your body's gonna do yeah

6717.6 --> 6721.619000000001
Placebo you think you're gonna die you

6720.0 --> 6723.84
really think so because the doctor said

6721.619 --> 6726.839999999999
so but guess what your body's gonna

6723.84 --> 6729.2390000000005
think so too and then it's gonna adapt

6726.84 --> 6731.6
to that and then guess what's gonna

6729.239 --> 6731.599999999999
happen

6734.82 --> 6739.98
you're probably gonna die because you

6737.699 --> 6741.9
were convinced you were and you believed

6739.98 --> 6743.94
it

6741.9 --> 6746.9
yeah

6743.94 --> 6746.9
I'm saying

6748.679 --> 6754.1
let me on the show no

6751.08 --> 6754.1
I'm gonna round out

6755.219 --> 6759.9
you have an example

6757.739 --> 6761.36
now was it of somebody that's already

6759.9 --> 6765.0599999999995
been

6761.36 --> 6768.0
severely medically engaged

6765.06 --> 6769.4400000000005
good servant no I'm not letting you on

6768.0 --> 6771.54
the show

6769.44 --> 6774.119
you can tell me in the chat do you know

6771.54 --> 6777.0199999999995
anybody that wasn't like severely

6774.119 --> 6777.0199999999995
medically

6777.6 --> 6781.9400000000005
buried on their medication

6782.28 --> 6786.96
all that

6784.679 --> 6790.82
your brother lived

6786.96 --> 6790.82
I what are you saying

6798.119 --> 6804.0199999999995
you're just gonna have to type it out

6799.86 --> 6804.0199999999995
I'm not gonna get you on the show

6808.38 --> 6810.92
foreign

6825.199 --> 6830.839999999999
yeah that's my question too by not

6828.06 --> 6830.84
taking the advice

6830.94 --> 6834.0199999999995
that'd be wise

holy [ __ ]

6846.239 --> 6850.159
that's pretty amazing good servant

6851.28 --> 6855.719
thank you for sharing that

6853.92 --> 6858.96
I thought for a second you had an

6855.719 --> 6861.84
example against it but yeah no you added

6858.96 --> 6863.52
an example to confirm what I was saying

6861.84 --> 6866.52
that's awesome

6863.52 --> 6869.219
glad to hear that he did actually make

6866.52 --> 6871.619000000001
out of it and still become so

6869.219 --> 6875.0
successful

6871.619 --> 6875.0
yeah thank you

6889.26 --> 6892.26
foreign

6896.1 --> 6901.08
so it's been pretty intense I'm

6898.199 --> 6903.659
wondering if I just I mean the return of

6901.08 --> 6907.4
Rage win is not exactly a

6903.659 --> 6907.4
an informative title

6907.92 --> 6910.58
ah

6926.12 --> 6929.2789999999995
[Music]

6931.739 --> 6933.739
um

6939.9 --> 6942.9
foreign

6948.239 --> 6952.218999999999
so many subjects that I brought up

6963.3 --> 6968.58
[Applause]

6965.46 --> 6970.44
I had to just call it and much much more

6968.58 --> 6972.9
yeah

6970.44 --> 6975.0
because it's probably if I like actually

6972.9 --> 6976.5599999999995
go through all the detailed subjects it

6975.0 --> 6978.659
wouldn't just it just wouldn't fit in

6976.56 --> 6981.6
the title so I'm just calling it The

6978.659 --> 6983.94
Return of Ray twin and much much more I

6981.6 --> 6986.1
think that works

6983.94 --> 6988.919999999999
war is a racket

6986.1 --> 6990.719
no because it wasn't I didn't actually

6988.92 --> 6994.56
discuss that

6990.719 --> 6997.44
and war is not necessarily a racket it's

6994.56 --> 7001.52
just a thing that

6997.44 --> 7003.86
that's just keeps happening

7001.52 --> 7006.139
right as it was talking much more about

7003.86 --> 7008.659
how do you recognize whether something

7006.139 --> 7013.400000000001
was faked

7008.659 --> 7016.46
or not faked based on the situation so

7013.4 --> 7020.0599999999995
it's like about inside of

7016.46 --> 7023.0
war strategies and politics like that's

7020.06 --> 7026.06
oh thank you good servant I appreciate

7023.0 --> 7027.86
that I did get a PayPal donation today

7026.06 --> 7030.1990000000005

7027.86 --> 7033.04
from PJ Cruiser that was awesome thank

7030.199 --> 7033.04

7035.06 --> 7037.06
um

7043.82 --> 7047.299999999999

7047.3 --> 7051.099

7053.96 --> 7059.56

7056.78 --> 7059.5599999999995
[ __ ] sake

7063.199 --> 7066.199
foreign

7085.04 --> 7088.229
[Music]

7098.36 --> 7101.139
foreign

7103.159 --> 7107.179
but yeah I think I am going to run out

7105.199 --> 7108.98
to show I've been going for almost two

7107.179 --> 7111.8
hours

7108.98 --> 7114.739
there's no live show on fed

7111.8 --> 7116.7390000000005
try to join my what

7114.739 --> 7116.739
um

7118.41 --> 7125.539
[Music]

7118.95 --> 7125.539

7142.92 --> 7145.979
[Music]

7149.79 --> 7152.869
[Music]

7161.06 --> 7167.179
do I know what's up with fvd again uh

7164.239 --> 7170.48
well yes but apparently I'm not supposed

7167.179 --> 7173.3
to be sharing about it

7170.48 --> 7175.638999999999
that's the message I just got I just

7173.3 --> 7179.139
know I can tell you apparently there's

7175.639 --> 7179.139
no live fpd today

7181.4 --> 7185.96
from what I

7183.26 --> 7187.52
yeah oh Adam meakin well that's gonna

7185.96 --> 7189.92
help a lot

7187.52 --> 7192.8
I mean that's not just gonna make people

7189.92 --> 7196.4
more curious about it brilliant

7192.8 --> 7198.4400000000005
yeah uh but there's no live FTD today

7196.4 --> 7202.119
apparently I'm thinking it's probably

7198.44 --> 7202.119
not going to be there tomorrow either

7202.36 --> 7207.44
so yeah it's probably back Monday or

7205.159 --> 7209.719
something but oh well

7207.44 --> 7211.339999999999
I'm still gonna go live I didn't go live

7209.719 --> 7214.52
yesterday but

7211.34 --> 7217.76
because I was just too exhausted but in

7214.52 --> 7220.46
the meantime you can all support me

7217.76 --> 7222.5
instead of Nathan for actually doing a

7220.46 --> 7225.139
live show

7222.5 --> 7226.88
right so everybody that really likes

7225.139 --> 7229.34
Flat Earth debates

7226.88 --> 7232.400000000001
you gotta realize that Nathan is just

7229.34 --> 7234.619000000001
not not doing a live show this week and

7232.4 --> 7237.379999999999
not even saying why

7234.619 --> 7240.92
so I think that I definitely deserve to

7237.38 --> 7243.1990000000005
be compensated for well

7240.92 --> 7245.06
going live every day

7243.199 --> 7247.159
except for yesterday because it was just

7245.06 --> 7249.320000000001
too exhausted

7247.159 --> 7251.799999999999
so

7249.32 --> 7251.799999999999
right

7252.44 --> 7258.5
I mean I do do a show every day for

7256.04 --> 7262.46
almost four years

7258.5 --> 7265.58
I do contribute I lay out ideas I bring

7262.46 --> 7267.9800000000005
out technicalities I educate on flatter

7265.58 --> 7270.8
a subjects and other things

7267.98 --> 7275.36
and I think I do deserve

7270.8 --> 7278.96
to have some compensation for that

7275.36 --> 7280.58
well and I'd hope to actually get it to

7278.96 --> 7283.46
another level

7280.58 --> 7286.219
because Nathan keeps saying he's so

7283.46 --> 7288.44
freaking poor to be fair I don't believe

7286.219 --> 7291.8
anything about that

7288.44 --> 7293.08
dude he is constantly buying new

7291.8 --> 7297.9800000000005
equipment

7293.08 --> 7300.92
like real big stuff constantly

7297.98 --> 7305.0599999999995
he is not poor sure

7300.92 --> 7307.6990000000005
he has a family dude I took a look he

7305.06 --> 7311.42
had a video about just his kids just

7307.699 --> 7314.9
looking at that bedroom it's like dude

7311.42 --> 7317.659
that bedroom is like 10 times as

7314.9 --> 7320.54
luxurious as a bedroom that I've ever

7317.659 --> 7324.619
had and I came from well sort of a lower

7320.54 --> 7328.639
middle class family okay so horseshit

7324.619 --> 7328.639
he's doing fantastically

7328.82 --> 7333.199
fantastically

7331.159 --> 7335.239
and anyway I think he deserves it

7333.199 --> 7336.138999999999
because he does put a lot of work into

7335.239 --> 7339.799999999999
it

7336.139 --> 7343.719
but he's not poor I'm poor I actually

7339.8 --> 7347.7390000000005
have to scramble for money for food okay

7343.719 --> 7347.7390000000005
I am actually poor

7349.58 --> 7355.82
and I hope to get

7353.0 --> 7358.76
some compensation so it could just keep

7355.82 --> 7362.119
going and doing what I do

7358.76 --> 7364.46
maybe even next time how about

7362.119 --> 7368.719
new shoes

7364.46 --> 7371.2390000000005
or new pants or a new jacket

7368.719 --> 7374.42
or

7371.239 --> 7376.94
or I don't know any other basic things

7374.42 --> 7378.619
you know that people tend to like yeah

7376.94 --> 7381.138999999999
yeah we're gonna get a new one every

7378.619 --> 7384.5599999999995
three years yeah yeah I'm doing with all

7381.139 --> 7386.2390000000005
my stuff for 10 years now without any

7384.56 --> 7389.3
replacement

7386.239 --> 7392.98
I'd like some compensation I'd like to

7389.3 --> 7392.9800000000005
actually be able to get around

7393.38 --> 7397.219
at all

7394.76 --> 7399.56
that would be great that would be great

7397.219 --> 7401.599
if I actually got some real support for

7399.56 --> 7406.119000000001
my efforts my real efforts and

7401.599 --> 7406.119000000001
dedication of being here every day

7406.82 --> 7411.139
working on the community on the

7409.639 --> 7413.179
psychology

7411.139 --> 7416.36
helping you out

7413.179 --> 7418.599
giving you good ideas that you can build

7416.36 --> 7418.598999999999
on

7419.0 --> 7425.599
right and I've got a whole bunch of

7422.9 --> 7428.719
ideas that I rolled out over the years a

7425.599 --> 7432.619000000001
whole load how many people have actual

7428.719 --> 7435.26
solid durable ideas that they introduced

7432.619 --> 7438.139
personally

7435.26 --> 7441.02
that then turn into great things how

7438.139 --> 7443.54
many how many people out there on the

7441.02 --> 7447.56
flatter do you know that actually roll

7443.54 --> 7449.3
out revolutionary ideas that have become

7447.56 --> 7451.9400000000005
the norm

7449.3 --> 7455.26
how many how many people do you know

7451.94 --> 7455.259999999999
that do that at all

7456.92 --> 7461.179
I know one that does it

7459.08 --> 7464.38
me

7461.179 --> 7467.42
I bring out revolutionary new insights

7464.38 --> 7470.36
that completely changed the game and I

7467.42 --> 7473.4800000000005
did it five years ago and we are now

7470.36 --> 7476.96
starting to see I was right

7473.48 --> 7479.138999999999
we're all starting to see it

7476.96 --> 7483.38
now can I please

7479.139 --> 7485.659000000001
Ascend out of poverty for that as a

7483.38 --> 7487.28
compensation that would be great that

7485.659 --> 7490.58
would be great if I don't have to be

7487.28 --> 7495.759999999999
[ __ ] poor anymore and wear worn out

7490.58 --> 7495.76

7787.82 --> 7791.78
mean except when you're just like too

7789.619 --> 7793.82
busy you're like I'm sorry I'm doing

7791.78 --> 7795.8
this and this I'm just listening in the

7793.82 --> 7797.599
background and I need to freaking on the

7795.8 --> 7799.820000000001
keyboard so I can interact with you

7797.599 --> 7802.28
right that's a little annoying but hey

7799.82 --> 7804.139
if you're working I'm not gonna say how

7802.28 --> 7807.259999999999
dare you work when you should be typing

7804.139 --> 7810.08
on the keyboard with me no

7807.26 --> 7812.3
sometimes I might say that but I don't

7810.08 --> 7815.179
really think like that

7812.3 --> 7818.2390000000005
I mean in general I mean people out

7815.179 --> 7821.06
there I mean people that know about me I

7818.239 --> 7823.879999999999
mean look at freaking at that giant

7821.06 --> 7828.9800000000005
giant list of patreon supporters that

7823.88 --> 7832.400000000001
Nathan has giant list Giant

7828.98 --> 7834.199
I got three I got three patreons and I

7832.4 --> 7836.36
really appreciate that they're there and

7834.199 --> 7838.82
they do keep supporting me it's just

7836.36 --> 7840.38
like yeah 20 bucks

7838.82 --> 7842.299999999999
I mean

7840.38 --> 7844.76
it's not going to feed me

7842.3 --> 7847.6990000000005
but it's there and I really appreciate

7844.76 --> 7850.2390000000005
it I'm just a little like baffled like

7847.699 --> 7853.098999999999
how does Nathan have like

7850.239 --> 7855.619
200 patreon supporters

7853.099 --> 7858.52
and I have three

7855.619 --> 7858.5199999999995
I don't get it

7858.92 --> 7864.9800000000005
I just don't

7860.719 --> 7868.52
but then again I do get PayPal

7864.98 --> 7870.259999999999
I do get some of that

7868.52 --> 7872.360000000001
dude I've been scrolling even through

7870.26 --> 7875.360000000001
the list and this just it's a long list

7872.36 --> 7877.219
by now I do get more than I used to but

7875.36 --> 7882.0199999999995
then again the bills have become higher

7877.219 --> 7883.639
I my rent went up like 80 Euros in total

7882.02 --> 7885.9800000000005
this year

7883.639 --> 7887.78
something like that more

7885.98 --> 7892.839999999999
yeah more

7887.78 --> 7892.84
went up 100 Euros which is like a fifth

7894.92 --> 7899.54
so I do need the extra

7897.38 --> 7901.159000000001
and it go I've got it right now so thank

7899.54 --> 7903.739
you very much I'm rounding out the show

7901.159 --> 7905.659
I think yeah there is no life fed

7903.739 --> 7908.659
unfortunately

7905.659 --> 7910.94
is there any Premiere or anything no

7908.659 --> 7913.82
that's weird it's not even a Premiere

7910.94 --> 7916.28
that's odd

7913.82 --> 7917.84
right

7916.28 --> 7920.42
ah

7917.84 --> 7923.719
hey jado good to see you

7920.42 --> 7927.139
best wishes yeah though have you just

7923.719 --> 7929.96
have you like contacted the bank yet to

7927.139 --> 7931.82
basically retract the the bank transfer

7929.96 --> 7933.199
that you tried what is it now half a

7931.82 --> 7935.92
year ago because I don't think it's

7933.199 --> 7935.919999999999
gonna come through

7953.02 --> 7958.76
Life Check once a week well Nathan does

7956.659 --> 7962.119
shout out his patreons during the

7958.76 --> 7965.900000000001
pre-show every single show pretty much

7962.119 --> 7969.199
so and in general Nathan is more

7965.9 --> 7971.839999999999
serviceable he is he puts in a lot of

7969.199 --> 7975.0199999999995
work with this computer

7971.84 --> 7977.719
with this Channel with everything he

7975.02 --> 7981.26
does I not so much

7977.719 --> 7983.4800000000005
but I'd like to then basically put all

7981.26 --> 7986.06
that effort instead in my actual

7983.48 --> 7988.699
performance and in my ideas that I share

7986.06 --> 7991.159000000001
and how I share them

7988.699 --> 7995.119
right so yeah

7991.159 --> 7997.759999999999
Nathan deserves more than I do

7995.119 --> 8000.639
but I deserve more than I'm getting

7997.76 --> 8003.119000000001
right now despite that that's how I feel

8000.639 --> 8003.119
about it

8007.32 --> 8012.34
sure you wouldn't

8010.3 --> 8016.06
no it's not just about the equipment

8012.34 --> 8019.599
it's also about just like being on

8016.06 --> 8022.0
YouTube and setting the title cards and

8019.599 --> 8023.860000000001
the little thingies and just planning

8022.0 --> 8026.199
out his schedule he puts a lot of work

8023.86 --> 8030.098999999999
into it I don't

8026.199 --> 8032.799999999999
I don't put that sort of work into it

8030.099 --> 8036.46
because I find it extremely annoying to

8032.8 --> 8040.0
do that like it that's like

8036.46 --> 8042.28
I don't like doing that at all

8040.0 --> 8044.92
I mean yeah

8042.28 --> 8046.119
just the way it is also yeah I guess

8044.92 --> 8049.54
that

8046.119 --> 8053.259999999999
if I had like money

8049.54 --> 8056.619
for like real professional software and

8053.26 --> 8060.22
[ __ ] then that would probably help and

8056.619 --> 8062.5599999999995
stimulate me to do more that's true but

8060.22 --> 8065.38
[Music]

8062.56 --> 8067.4800000000005
I'm not like oh I can't wait to buy like

8065.38 --> 8070.06
the newest this and that so it could do

8067.48 --> 8072.28
better and it's just like if I had it I

8070.06 --> 8074.7390000000005
could probably do it easier

8072.28 --> 8076.599
because now I'm just my video editing

8074.739 --> 8079.659
programs suck

8076.599 --> 8081.88
I mean they really suck I'm using like

8079.659 --> 8084.579
the basic default

8081.88 --> 8087.400000000001
from Windows it's useless completely

8084.579 --> 8089.86
useless it's slow as [ __ ]

8087.4 --> 8092.32
and frustrating to work with

8089.86 --> 8095.0199999999995
I could use something better but I I

8092.32 --> 8097.799999999999
can't afford that

8095.02 --> 8097.8
foreign

8097.98 --> 8105.4
that I have is like Photoshop 7.

8101.44 --> 8107.259999999999
that's still great it's excellent for

8105.4 --> 8109.119
what I use it for

8107.26 --> 8111.6990000000005
but yeah you can't use that for video

8109.119 --> 8115.259999999999
editing and since YouTube is all about

8111.699 --> 8115.259999999999
the videos you know

8115.36 --> 8120.46
video editing takes a good PC yeah but I

8117.579 --> 8124.42
think that my PCC can can handle it

8120.46 --> 8126.88
right PC is pretty good

8124.42 --> 8130.3
and I don't exhaust it

8126.88 --> 8132.400000000001
because I don't play heart attack stupid

8130.3 --> 8134.139
video games that just drain your

8132.4 --> 8135.879999999999
computer and then don't give anything

8134.139 --> 8138.34
interesting in return

8135.88 --> 8140.639
I play old video games and now it works

8138.34 --> 8143.92
perfectly smooth I mean great

8140.639 --> 8147.46
civilization five which it does kind of

8143.92 --> 8151.42
require quite some rendering power

8147.46 --> 8155.38
for a well for what was 2010 it works

8151.42 --> 8157.84
hyper hyper smooth without any problems

8155.38 --> 8160.9800000000005
so

8157.84 --> 8163.719
right as long as I don't like

8160.98 --> 8166.36
do too many things at the same time

8163.719 --> 8168.159
Video Edit and watch a movie and do this

8166.36 --> 8170.259999999999
and that and play a video okay my

8168.159 --> 8172.239
computer is going to be absolutely fine

8170.26 --> 8174.88
it's no problem whatsoever

8172.239 --> 8177.718999999999
civilization is five is it still amazing

8174.88 --> 8177.719
yeah I know

8177.88 --> 8183.96
it is I I played actually on a daily

8181.42 --> 8183.96
basis

8184.78 --> 8190.5
I mean I must have played that game like

8187.0 --> 8190.5
over a thousand times now

8191.56 --> 8198.099
and like finished it

8194.559 --> 8200.199999999999
I know pretty much every Rhythm that

8198.099 --> 8202.059
that's going to happen within the game I

8200.2 --> 8203.380000000001
just know how it works through and

8202.059 --> 8204.639
through but it's still extremely

8203.38 --> 8208.059
entertaining

8204.639 --> 8210.098999999998
singles play yeah single player and I

8208.059 --> 8212.74
start completely from scratch I usually

8210.099 --> 8214.059
play Russia by the way oh and I started

8212.74 --> 8217.479
doing that

8214.059 --> 8219.518999999998
in 2011.

8217.479 --> 8222.16
so that has nothing to do with any

8219.519 --> 8224.139000000001
stupid political situation I just think

8222.16 --> 8226.0
that Russia is awesome

8224.139 --> 8228.46
in the game

8226.0 --> 8229.96
then well

8228.46 --> 8232.178999999998
just

8229.96 --> 8234.88
like the music that they have

8232.179 --> 8237.399
accompanied with them I just yeah

8234.88 --> 8241.559
whatever I like I like to play Russian

8237.399 --> 8241.559
civilization fine that's it

8242.92 --> 8250.74
also the the range of European music I

8247.84 --> 8250.74
just really prefer

8252.88 --> 8259.059
and Russia is classified under European

8256.059 --> 8261.099
music based in the game anyway I'm not

8259.059 --> 8263.018999999998
gonna now spend my time talking about

8261.099 --> 8265.380000000001
that game I'm actually gonna round out

8263.019 --> 8265.380000000001
the show

8269.74 --> 8273.399
this was before the Ukrainian situation

8272.2 --> 8275.92
yeah

8273.399 --> 8278.74
the Russian music is also a dude Russia

8275.92 --> 8281.5
is freaking awesome it really is I like

8278.74 --> 8284.08
Russia I like Russia as a country

8281.5 --> 8287.139
it's been kind of it started out a bit

8284.08 --> 8290.28
alien to me but you have to realize that

8287.139 --> 8293.5
I literally grew up

8290.28 --> 8295.179
with all kinds of people that just hate

8293.5 --> 8297.34
Russia and they've been trying to

8295.179 --> 8299.019
convince me that Russia is like the

8297.34 --> 8301.3
ultimate Evil

8299.019 --> 8303.28
series like people have tried to

8301.3 --> 8305.979
convince me of that

8303.28 --> 8308.979000000001
in my life and I never really bought it

8305.979 --> 8311.619999999999
but it made me very nervous

8308.979 --> 8313.779999999999
also nervous for my country like why are

8311.62 --> 8317.380000000001
these people so [ __ ] obsessed with

8313.78 --> 8319.979000000001
Russia and I'm talking like the 90s yeah

8317.38 --> 8323.8
this is not like

8319.979 --> 8324.82
2010 or so no no I'm talking like way

8323.8 --> 8328.96
back

8324.82 --> 8330.279999999999
people like really really hated Russia

8328.96 --> 8332.979
for some reason

8330.28 --> 8335.92
some of them and they were like wanting

8332.979 --> 8338.92
to conspire to destroy it

8335.92 --> 8342.0
and that was in the 90s I never

8338.92 --> 8342.0
understood why

8343.559 --> 8349.539999999999
at first I thought it had to do with all

8346.479 --> 8352.119999999999
the Soviets but then it turned out no no

8349.54 --> 8354.76
actually exactly the opposite

8352.12 --> 8356.5
those those people actually liked the

8354.76 --> 8359.62
Soviets

8356.5 --> 8362.76
and they hate that Russia is free really

8359.62 --> 8362.76
sick people actually

8363.939 --> 8369.939
you can have a guess as to what their

8367.12 --> 8372.399000000001
religious background is but I'll I'm not

8369.939 --> 8375.099
gonna say it though but I'm sure you can

8372.399 --> 8377.8
guess right but thanks everyone for
