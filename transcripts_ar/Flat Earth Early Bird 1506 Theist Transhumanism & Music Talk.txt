quite needed still

100.439 --> 105.77999999999999
so please keep it coming right the

102.96 --> 108.24
weather today is pretty much identical

105.78 --> 110.04
to yesterday it's beautiful

108.24 --> 112.86
I thought they were gonna like spray

110.04 --> 115.799
Chemtrails but

112.86 --> 117.84
yeah not so much

115.799 --> 121.07900000000001
there's some planes flying but they're

117.84 --> 125.299
not leaving any persistent trails

121.079 --> 125.29899999999999
so it's overall been very beautiful

134.64 --> 137.11999999999998
foreign

143.58 --> 149.04000000000002
almost wind still although not as wind

146.76 --> 150.959
still as yesterday I can still see some

149.04 --> 153.72
branches moving a little bit yesterday

150.959 --> 154.98
it was just completely wind still

153.72 --> 158.599
right

154.98 --> 158.599
but still incredibly beautiful

158.76 --> 164.64
it had Frozen this night also there was

162.0 --> 166.8
ice everywhere again

164.64 --> 169.26
uh

166.8 --> 172.86
but that's because well it it stayed

169.26 --> 175.44
clear so there were also some

172.86 --> 179.66000000000003
decent

175.44 --> 179.66
oh there was no stars visible though

179.7 --> 182.29999999999998
no

182.519 --> 187.37900000000002
but the moon was very visible though

185.22 --> 188.7
and Cooling

187.379 --> 191.159
right

188.7 --> 197.22
anyway

191.159 --> 200.099
is Wednesday the 8th of February 2023

197.22 --> 203.94
and check the temperature I think it's

200.099 --> 206.099
probably five or six

203.94 --> 208.379
yeah it's six

206.099 --> 211.28
six degrees Celsius zero percent

208.379 --> 211.28
participation

212.04 --> 215.84
that's something you don't see every day

218.459 --> 225.379
it's gonna cloud back up tomorrow though

221.22 --> 225.379
so according to the forecast anyway

226.92 --> 229.33999999999997
right

232.92 --> 235.92
okay

236.7 --> 242.22
seven watching now nobody in check just

239.819 --> 246.44
yet still waiting

242.22 --> 246.44
oh man I feel really good by the way

246.48 --> 253.67999999999998
I had

248.28 --> 255.599
my birthday dinner steak as I said I

253.68 --> 257.519
would

255.599 --> 260.699
and I had like I ate pretty early

257.519 --> 262.88
everything and went to bed early still

260.699 --> 266.22
slept very long

262.88 --> 268.88
this morning I didn't know it was just

266.22 --> 268.88000000000005
great

269.82 --> 274.979
I feel good also yeah

272.82 --> 277.62
this book came in

274.979 --> 281.419
that was quick

277.62 --> 281.419
it's not as big as I thought it would be

283.44 --> 290.71999999999997
100 almost

285.66 --> 290.72
all right 195 Pages rough yeah

293.04 --> 298.08000000000004
but yeah I'm uh

295.56 --> 301.28000000000003
reading quickly through something

298.08 --> 303.06
through it it does seem to be like

301.28 --> 304.61999999999995
entertainingly written and

303.06 --> 307.62
[Music]

304.62 --> 310.259
and technically apt I'm already seeing

307.62 --> 312.54
like terminologies coming by that I have

310.259 --> 315.56
become quite kind enough familiar with

312.54 --> 318.18
thanks to movie reviewers

315.56 --> 321.54
that I've been following now for what is

318.18 --> 325.1
it 15 years or something

321.54 --> 325.1
yeah 15 years

326.94 --> 333.139
maybe longer 70. but this is interesting

334.68 --> 341.16
I'm very certain it's going to give me

336.72 --> 343.68
like a sharper look on on movies

341.16 --> 347.41900000000004
because most my reviewing thus far has

343.68 --> 347.419
been all very intuitive

349.919 --> 356.78
like not so much like about genre

353.58 --> 356.78
or that sort of thing

357.66 --> 363.199
I must find a genre is hard to pin down

360.24 --> 363.199
exactly

363.66 --> 367.44
but I think that's like a whole movie

365.58 --> 370.32
thing

367.44 --> 373.1
for the experts even anyway

370.32 --> 373.09999999999997
where's everybody

378.24 --> 381.919
it's taking so long guys

387.419 --> 390.5
12 watching

404.34 --> 406.88
foreign

408.979 --> 414.06
anyway let's just go through what I was

412.62 --> 417.44
doing yesterday

414.06 --> 419.78000000000003
Flat Earth debates was great

417.44 --> 422.759
Nathan yeah

419.78 --> 424.85999999999996
expanded the show

422.759 --> 427.259
for like half an hour a little more

424.86 --> 429.3
maybe and then the after show was like

427.259 --> 432.06
literally five minutes

429.3 --> 433.56
so he was basically like promising oh

432.06 --> 435.96
I'm gonna do a long shot when he was

433.56 --> 439.94
absolutely planning not to do a long

435.96 --> 439.94
show no matter what pretty much

441.08 --> 447.139
but I mean most of it was very

444.66 --> 447.139
interesting

449.639 --> 452.419
uh

456.5 --> 460.819
what was I watching

466.8 --> 473.58
oh Benjamin I watched a bit

470.4 --> 478.56
Alex Jones Show

473.58 --> 481.02
but only preliminary uh yeah

478.56 --> 483.319
I don't think I'm really that interested

481.02 --> 483.31899999999996
anymore

488.96 --> 494.039
I mean the last few streams have been

491.639 --> 497.40000000000003
him playing what I would just generally

494.039 --> 500.099
call hardcore just a bunch of banging

497.4 --> 502.31899999999996
sort of DJ thing he does and

500.099 --> 504.06
and bickering against some guy I've

502.319 --> 506.28000000000003
never heard of who's like an obvious

504.06 --> 508.74
online troll

506.28 --> 510.96
and he spent like the entire show doing

508.74 --> 515.099
that and like it's important and I'm

510.96 --> 518.8199999999999
like okay I'm the [ __ ] out of here man

515.099 --> 521.88
I mean if they did that one time but to

518.82 --> 524.82
keep doing it and the entire show like

521.88 --> 528.2
I'm out of here this place is like Rife

524.82 --> 528.2
with demons

530.94 --> 537.1800000000001
like worse than my worst shows

534.54 --> 540.18
so I'm not yeah I didn't like

537.18 --> 541.9799999999999
unsubscribe or anything I'll keep

540.18 --> 543.779
checking it every now and then but I'm

541.98 --> 545.399
just there's absolutely nothing I can

543.779 --> 547.58
get there these people aren't even

545.399 --> 550.68
interested in like

547.58 --> 553.1
perfecting their insights that they just

550.68 --> 553.0999999999999
don't care

556.32 --> 561.32
anyway

557.339 --> 561.32
hey dank first in chat good to see you

571.62 --> 579.019
okay

574.32 --> 579.019
free game let's see huh

579.86 --> 585.2
dark and darker

582.72 --> 585.2
okay

588.18 --> 591.68
What type of game is it

608.339 --> 612.4200000000001
yeah

609.0 --> 615.18
oh yeah also of course kiwi live

612.42 --> 617.76
and Jim Bob

615.18 --> 620.04
and flat side they all go live at the

617.76 --> 622.14
same time roughly it's like oh it's

620.04 --> 625.56
brilliant

622.14 --> 628.86
but yeah QE live was another

625.56 --> 631.8
show where Betty was basically being all

628.86 --> 635.54
Betty and I'm like

631.8 --> 635.54
I'm not wasting my time with this

636.6 --> 639.72
I mean she's really on getting on my

638.64 --> 642.5
nerves

639.72 --> 642.5
a lot

648.54 --> 653.8199999999999
and I'm being pretty verbal about it in

651.36 --> 656.04
there in the chat too so it's like yeah

653.82 --> 660.0600000000001
hey man

656.04 --> 662.8199999999999
how are you loving the uh the person

660.06 --> 665.279
that you love so much ruining your show

662.82 --> 666.6
how do you like it gooey how do you like

665.279 --> 669.86
it

666.6 --> 669.86
you have no control

669.959 --> 674.3599999999999
your lost control buddy for your own

672.12 --> 674.36
show

677.579 --> 683.06
that he is funny okay I'm glad you think

680.579 --> 683.06
she's funny

694.56 --> 699.68
because I'm I'm not amused by it at all

697.14 --> 699.68
so

704.94 --> 707.94
foreign

712.32 --> 715.359
[Music]

718.16 --> 722.3389999999999
yeah

720.0 --> 724.62
if things work out all right like very

722.339 --> 729.0600000000001
soon there should be some kind of a

724.62 --> 730.68
Jim Bob versus own Benjamin stream

729.06 --> 732.1199999999999
I don't know exactly when they're going

730.68 --> 734.0999999999999
to do that but

732.12 --> 736.14
that should be extremely interesting

734.1 --> 739.74
because well own Benjamin is very

736.14 --> 742.92
competent very competent

739.74 --> 745.38
and he's like on to Jim Bob in the same

742.92 --> 747.18
way that I am not saying oh he's

745.38 --> 750.24
secretly a shill or anything but he's

747.18 --> 753.54
like totally figured him out

750.24 --> 756.24
because Jim Bob does have like grabbler

753.54 --> 759.66
adjacent ways

756.24 --> 761.64
and he basically did that to me

759.66 --> 764.519
when he just called things arbitrary and

761.64 --> 766.56
I'm now very actively without him

764.519 --> 769.92
addressing anything about it

766.56 --> 773.0999999999999
basically making fun of it right I mean

769.92 --> 775.3199999999999
hey Jim Bob loves that trolling right he

773.1 --> 779.519
loves just getting in your face and

775.32 --> 782.1600000000001
hitting a a soft spot making fun of that

779.519 --> 784.8
is absolutely Shameless about so yeah

782.16 --> 785.6999999999999
hey hey jimbob I could do that too you

784.8 --> 788.0999999999999
know

785.7 --> 790.62
so I'm gonna keep making fun of your use

788.1 --> 792.72
of the word arbitrary which you really

790.62 --> 795.0
like and you have other words for it too

792.72 --> 796.8000000000001
but I can literally call out the point

795.0 --> 800.6
that you're calling something arbitrary

796.8 --> 800.5999999999999
and so I do that now in chat

801.18 --> 807.62
huh

802.38 --> 810.54
because you're using techno Babble yes

807.62 --> 813.6
misapplication of a word

810.54 --> 816.42
they're way too precise a word that is

813.6 --> 820.5600000000001
in this that's usually set in a very

816.42 --> 823.9799999999999
specific context then it fits perfectly

820.56 --> 825.4799999999999
it's not a word you just use as a as a

823.98 --> 828.54
label

825.48 --> 830.88
to categorize things you see you're

828.54 --> 833.3389999999999
misapplying the word

830.88 --> 834.959
and yeah most people don't get that

833.339 --> 837.9590000000001
I do

834.959 --> 840.779
and I think so does Owen Benjamin

837.959 --> 843.3599999999999
so hope you're gonna have fun with that

840.779 --> 846.6
because

843.36 --> 848.399
it's not uh gonna last very long you're

846.6 --> 850.139
gonna have to figure out another little

848.399 --> 852.92
trick

850.139 --> 852.92
Jim Bob

860.519 --> 865.74
ah give them up and yeah the vegan

862.74 --> 869.399
debate if this is yeah yeah I saw that

865.74 --> 871.74
that was actually kind of that was good

869.399 --> 873.54
and they totally deserve it because well

871.74 --> 877.019
Nathan Thompson

873.54 --> 879.56
is basically just as Shameless as Jim

877.019 --> 879.5600000000001
Bob is

880.62 --> 886.199
he he loves just like using quick

884.639 --> 889.699
Wizardry to

886.199 --> 889.699
put somebody off the trail

890.16 --> 895.2199999999999
and Jim Bob did a very good job

892.68 --> 895.2199999999999
I thought

896.22 --> 904.1990000000001
because also hey I mean they didn't pull

900.06 --> 907.8599999999999
in the religious aspect right

904.199 --> 910.38
the vegans actually did that so it's

907.86 --> 912.019
like yeah thanks for opening the door of

910.38 --> 915.42
our specialty here

912.019 --> 918.0600000000001
they did a lot of back research and that

915.42 --> 920.3389999999999
so yeah it was a good debate I really

918.06 --> 923.2199999999999
appreciate and I I don't hate Jim Bob

920.339 --> 926.72
it's just that he's got some Grappler

923.22 --> 926.72
traits and

927.0 --> 932.409
you gotta start pointing that out

929.33 --> 932.409
[Music]

932.639 --> 936.9590000000001
because

933.959 --> 939.68
I don't see people in his chat actually

936.959 --> 942.66
calling him on what he's saying

939.68 --> 945.66
their thing like gnostics are being kind

942.66 --> 949.139
of savanye because well he's just

945.66 --> 952.019
initiated that back and forth poking

949.139 --> 954.0
but I don't see anybody actually calling

952.019 --> 956.24
him out on just the way he explains

954.0 --> 956.24
things

958.8 --> 962.279
it's almost

960.42 --> 964.5
in that sense

962.279 --> 967.98
sort of a

964.5 --> 970.199
a little bit it's it's almost wrong to

967.98 --> 972.019
compare it but a little bit Ken wheeler

970.199 --> 975.7199999999999
issue that's why I call it

972.019 --> 977.82
technobabble it's very quick he knows a

975.72 --> 981.6600000000001
lot of specialist language and he put

977.82 --> 985.1
together a very interesting sounding

981.66 --> 988.199
drain a thinking which is like

985.1 --> 991.0790000000001
philosophically mathematical it's very

988.199 --> 993.7199999999999
precise in that sense but

991.079 --> 996.42
the structure is basically a false

993.72 --> 998.899
Bridge a bridge to nowhere it's going to

996.42 --> 998.899
fall down

999.42 --> 1005.42
the connections are actually it's it's

1001.82 --> 1008.12
very wizard-like to do that

1005.42 --> 1010.9399999999999
and I bet that it's like a natural habit

1008.12 --> 1013.4590000000001
those things pop up as a natural trick

1010.94 --> 1016.0400000000001
when you're very young

1013.459 --> 1018.8
as a social defense he's very good at it

1016.04 --> 1021.3389999999999
I have I have my own technobabble

1018.8 --> 1021.3389999999999
capabilities

1021.38 --> 1025.52
but I never

1023.12 --> 1028.1
tried to trick people

1025.52 --> 1031.819
with knowing that they wouldn't get it

1028.1 --> 1035.24
so I could just be sloppy and then seem

1031.819 --> 1037.299
really Superior I don't do that

1035.24 --> 1040.64
anymore anyway

1037.299 --> 1043.54
like for decades because it's got me

1040.64 --> 1043.5400000000002
into a lot of trouble

1045.38 --> 1048.5590000000002
huh

1047.24 --> 1051.26
anyway

1048.559 --> 1053.12
no thank you seem to be the only person

1051.26 --> 1055.8799999999999
in the chat today

1053.12 --> 1060.039
weird but I don't mind having you in

1055.88 --> 1060.0390000000002
there you're a good conversationalist

1069.32 --> 1073.1
it's like he has a very high IQ and

1071.299 --> 1077.44
arrogant about it like what's it anyway

1073.1 --> 1077.4399999999998
yeah fair fair enough

1080.12 --> 1085.8999999999999
but also I disagree

1082.64 --> 1085.9
he he doesn't

1095.299 --> 1099.559
well I guess that yours is most on point

1097.82 --> 1101.78
being arrogant about it

1099.559 --> 1104.4189999999999
and hey I'm

1101.78 --> 1106.76
kind of a little arrogant about it at

1104.419 --> 1108.2
times in the sense that I'm like no I'm

1106.76 --> 1111.08
definitely

1108.2 --> 1113.679
I'm not gonna be

1111.08 --> 1118.1
what do you say uh

1113.679 --> 1121.039
modest about my intelligence

1118.1 --> 1123.4399999999998
but I also know that I just need to

1121.039 --> 1126.62
prove it

1123.44 --> 1128.24
like that proving the intelligence is

1126.62 --> 1131.059
the only way to actually prove

1128.24 --> 1134.08
intelligence not just

1131.059 --> 1134.08
acting like it

1139.7 --> 1145.039
right but hey he's like that and it's

1143.24 --> 1146.179
all kinds of directions it can grow

1145.039 --> 1148.58
right

1146.179 --> 1150.5590000000002
he does seem to have ups and downs and

1148.58 --> 1152.96
moments where he's like less cocky less

1150.559 --> 1155.0
arrogant and just much more still

1152.96 --> 1157.46
and then

1155.0 --> 1158.96
he's actually smarter when he's like

1157.46 --> 1162.14
that

1158.96 --> 1165.039
it's much more perceptive more more

1162.14 --> 1165.039
empathic

1166.58 --> 1172.039
so I am not necessarily worried like

1169.22 --> 1173.72
it's gonna grow worse or anything that

1172.039 --> 1176.48
he's gonna grow into like a total

1173.72 --> 1178.72
arrogant like bastard that's like a

1176.48 --> 1178.72
dragon

1179.24 --> 1183.799
nasty or anything like I don't think

1181.34 --> 1187.36
he's gonna be that but he does have

1183.799 --> 1187.36
grabbler tricks like that

1200.48 --> 1209.2
where the hell is everybody guys

1205.22 --> 1209.2
what are you all on vacation

1210.679 --> 1214.6000000000001
did the internet go down

1218.9 --> 1220.96
um

1227.81 --> 1232.3999999999999
[Music]

1230.0 --> 1235.179
it's getting weird guys

1232.4 --> 1235.179
where's everybody

1248.72 --> 1251.38
foreign

1263.32 --> 1267.52
don't forget the Rogue ones it up

1270.559 --> 1273.34
all right anyway

1276.08 --> 1281.0
oh yeah no don't worry about it Dank I'm

1279.02 --> 1283.6
just kind of like where the hell's

1281.0 --> 1283.6
everybody else

1284.72 --> 1289.039
it's kind of weird

1287.24 --> 1291.26
the show has been going for like 21

1289.039 --> 1294.46
minutes

1291.26 --> 1294.46
but whatever

1295.22 --> 1298.22
uh

1308.12 --> 1312.039
in the meantime the whole

1313.159 --> 1322.46
political struggle is it it yes w e f

1317.9 --> 1325.159
puppets versus Free People

1322.46 --> 1330.94
situation in with us farmers and all

1325.159 --> 1330.94
that it's really getting pretty intense

1339.559 --> 1343.7
although yeah

1341.36 --> 1348.62
as soon as like really

1343.7 --> 1353.3600000000001
like interesting fractal implication

1348.62 --> 1355.6999999999998
things start to pop up I will definitely

1353.36 --> 1357.1399999999999
point it out and start talking about it

1355.7 --> 1360.52
at this point there's nothing like

1357.14 --> 1360.5200000000002
really happening just yet

1361.58 --> 1366.26
there was this weird little thing about

1364.52 --> 1370.6399999999999
little

1366.26 --> 1373.82
little article yesterday after my show

1370.64 --> 1376.64
about how apparently

1373.82 --> 1378.74
like the Rothschild Bank the original

1376.64 --> 1381.2
Bank

1378.74 --> 1384.74
from like the aiding

1381.2 --> 1387.799
from the 1900s

1384.74 --> 1390.08
is basically like

1387.799 --> 1391.52
they're buying people out and they're

1390.08 --> 1393.98
gonna

1391.52 --> 1397.6589999999999
like make it private

1393.98 --> 1397.659
like a non-public Bank

1397.7 --> 1402.559
that's really weird

1400.64 --> 1404.2990000000002
so it's not it's basically not a bank

1402.559 --> 1406.76
anywhere they're probably like just

1404.299 --> 1410.0
taking all their money out of the cyst

1406.76 --> 1414.2
out of circularity and just becoming

1410.0 --> 1416.12
a bank only for the rich Elite

1414.2 --> 1418.1000000000001
that they're just not public anymore

1416.12 --> 1420.559
that's that was kind of weird

1418.1 --> 1422.6589999999999
anyway hey Nathan R somebody else in

1420.559 --> 1425.0
chat

1422.659 --> 1426.67
just got out of work all right

1425.0 --> 1429.799
welcome to the show

1426.67 --> 1429.799
[Music]

1430.46 --> 1437.26
what's with the push to get bugs and

1432.74 --> 1437.26
they they want to try to force it dank

1438.679 --> 1443.6000000000001
I mean they're going full soil and green

1441.74 --> 1447.5
on us

1443.6 --> 1451.039
they're just going to do it they're so

1447.5 --> 1453.08
all that's left is what what isn't part

1451.039 --> 1455.96
of their control system that's trying to

1453.08 --> 1457.52
stay alive and fighting like for example

1455.96 --> 1459.799
our farmers

1457.52 --> 1463.46
when they go

1459.799 --> 1465.44
they'll just only give you bucks like oh

1463.46 --> 1467.96
oh yeah oh the food's no longer there

1465.44 --> 1470.0
yeah yeah we know

1467.96 --> 1472.22
oh why would that be yes because

1470.0 --> 1473.419
literally we made it impossible for

1472.22 --> 1475.34
people

1473.419 --> 1477.44
to have Farms

1475.34 --> 1481.28
for absolutely no reason

1477.44 --> 1482.179
and now here is what you are going to

1481.28 --> 1485.539
eat

1482.179 --> 1487.159
like oh oh oh yeah you literally don't

1485.539 --> 1489.14
get a choice

1487.159 --> 1490.159
like this is the only thing that's going

1489.14 --> 1492.14
to be available that's what they're

1490.159 --> 1495.44
gonna do

1492.14 --> 1499.039
and much much worse

1495.44 --> 1502.64
than trying to warn you about that for

1499.039 --> 1508.7
pretty much what is it four years

1502.64 --> 1512.3600000000001
yeah remember 82 that's more than 1400

1508.7 --> 1515.419
episodes ago

1512.36 --> 1518.24
is when I started to try to warn

1515.419 --> 1521.0200000000002
everybody for that

1518.24 --> 1527.559
it's already said it back then they have

1521.02 --> 1530.179
no limits they have no limits

1527.559 --> 1533.12
riding through it

1530.179 --> 1536.1200000000001
not trying to not be affected and still

1533.12 --> 1539.5
keep going trying to ignore it is going

1536.12 --> 1539.5
to end fatal

1542.779 --> 1549.08
so yeah I'm really wondering like well

1546.679 --> 1553.0
when is the new warrior class gonna make

1549.08 --> 1553.0
its move because there's no other choice

1553.22 --> 1559.88
and I'm obviously not part of that

1556.34 --> 1562.22
warrior class I'm not

1559.88 --> 1564.679
the right type for that

1562.22 --> 1567.08
not like that

1564.679 --> 1570.2
I'm intelligence

1567.08 --> 1574.1789999999999
in my own way like I would definitely

1570.2 --> 1574.179
like want to assist them

1574.22 --> 1578.059
so I'm yeah

1576.14 --> 1580.3400000000001
and I've been suspecting that it would

1578.059 --> 1582.26
come from Farmers

1580.34 --> 1584.6
I mean they have families they have

1582.26 --> 1588.039
cohesion they have

1584.6 --> 1588.039
much more strength

1591.38 --> 1596.3600000000001
so I really wonder what's gonna happen

1593.559 --> 1598.96
soon I think there's a lot gonna happen

1596.36 --> 1598.9599999999998
this year

1600.64 --> 1606.7990000000002
potentially leading up to actual Civil

1603.799 --> 1608.6589999999999
War not not that everybody all people

1606.799 --> 1611.12
are going to be involved in that in a

1608.659 --> 1613.22
direct sense

1611.12 --> 1617.26
but

1613.22 --> 1617.26
I've yes as shit's gonna go down

1622.059 --> 1630.6789999999999
and I also believe and hope that if the

1627.679 --> 1632.1200000000001
farmers are going to be able to outlive

1630.679 --> 1634.52
all this

1632.12 --> 1637.6999999999998
and that it wouldn't end up literally

1634.52 --> 1640.039
with military and tanks just blowing up

1637.7 --> 1641.96
their buildings and driving it all over

1640.039 --> 1645.08
like really

1641.96 --> 1648.6200000000001
just like total Destruction if that

1645.08 --> 1651.1399999999999
won't happen then we are going to win

1648.62 --> 1652.58
right but I mean if it's going to be

1651.14 --> 1654.6200000000001
pushed to that level where you're

1652.58 --> 1656.059
literally going to use the military to

1654.62 --> 1658.84
assault

1656.059 --> 1658.84
the public

1659.36 --> 1663.34
then we got a really big problem

1663.5 --> 1669.559
and I don't know if that's like

1666.98 --> 1672.6200000000001
I don't know how [ __ ] up the military

1669.559 --> 1674.72
people are really or if they would just

1672.62 --> 1676.6999999999998
have foreign agents that just take

1674.72 --> 1679.52
control over it's like okay this group

1676.7 --> 1681.44
is now taking over the equipment not

1679.52 --> 1684.46
something like that might happen who

1681.44 --> 1684.46
knows what that would be

1689.48 --> 1695.059
right could be like the freaking British

1692.179 --> 1696.3200000000002
army or who knows like mossada or

1695.059 --> 1700.52
something

1696.32 --> 1703.7
or IDF or whatever and something could

1700.52 --> 1705.74
potentially be used to just start

1703.7 --> 1707.0
assaulting the resistance like really

1705.74 --> 1710.299
brutally

1707.0 --> 1712.76
that could potentially happen I do not

1710.299 --> 1715.22
see it as like outside of their

1712.76 --> 1718.34
capability of doing that

1715.22 --> 1720.74
the current cartel politicians that are

1718.34 --> 1725.8999999999999
like obviously

1720.74 --> 1729.34
like Invaders and blatant traitors to

1725.9 --> 1729.3400000000001
the country and the public

1735.26 --> 1737.98
foreign

1742.76 --> 1748.279
I don't know Nathan r i I have no idea

1745.64 --> 1751.3600000000001
for your country I think that America is

1748.279 --> 1751.36
probably going to be

1751.94 --> 1757.3400000000001
sounds weird

1753.62 --> 1759.799
but I've seen this and in my vision I

1757.34 --> 1762.32
and I've said it a couple of times but

1759.799 --> 1765.2
maybe now people will understand it

1762.32 --> 1768.74
better I think America is going to

1765.2 --> 1771.919
literally be invaded by Russia

1768.74 --> 1772.82
but actually in a good way yeah I said

1771.919 --> 1776.0590000000002
it

1772.82 --> 1779.0
I think because

1776.059 --> 1782.36
America is really in a lot of ways at

1779.0 --> 1785.0
the core like the core instigator

1782.36 --> 1787.52
of this war on Russia

1785.0 --> 1790.64
and I think that Russia is at some point

1787.52 --> 1792.86
going to be like yeah oh okay right well

1790.64 --> 1795.38
now we're gonna make our move and I

1792.86 --> 1798.279
think that they're just going to like

1795.38 --> 1798.279
take out

1798.62 --> 1801.82
the American Capital

1802.399 --> 1807.4399999999998
foreign

1804.399 --> 1809.2399999999998
a whole yeah a whole Army that's not

1807.44 --> 1811.5800000000002
gonna go after the public but

1809.24 --> 1815.1200000000001
specifically after this after these

1811.58 --> 1816.9189999999999
government factions and then all shit's

1815.12 --> 1819.26
gonna break loose because then suddenly

1816.919 --> 1823.1000000000001
all the gangs

1819.26 --> 1825.94
right all the actual gangsters and like

1823.1 --> 1829.4599999999998
heavy criminals that have been all

1825.94 --> 1831.3200000000002
pampered by those people by those

1829.46 --> 1833.8400000000001
freaking government people

1831.32 --> 1836.36
right that's why they'll keep getting

1833.84 --> 1839.36
released they are going to then be like

1836.36 --> 1841.039
a pillaging horde that is gonna go

1839.36 --> 1844.279
against the Russian army

1841.039 --> 1845.539
and it's gonna do incredible damage like

1844.279 --> 1847.64
trash

1845.539 --> 1849.679
cities

1847.64 --> 1852.2
but they will not last long because

1849.679 --> 1855.26
they're not military

1852.2 --> 1857.48
they're crazy people some of them may

1855.26 --> 1862.1
have Gorilla tactics but I mean an

1857.48 --> 1864.08
organized Army with heavy weaponry

1862.1 --> 1865.82
is yeah

1864.08 --> 1867.9189999999999
foreign

1865.82 --> 1869.779
they can't win

1867.919 --> 1873.3400000000001
right so this is

1869.779 --> 1873.34
kind of elaborate isn't it

1874.1 --> 1881.9189999999999
yeah

1876.7 --> 1881.919
I gazed upon it in my vision

1886.46 --> 1891.2
and dude it will be the best thing that

1888.919 --> 1894.88
has happened to America

1891.2 --> 1894.88
since the American Revolution

1896.6 --> 1902.1789999999999
because it's going to they are gonna

1899.779 --> 1904.6
take the route

1902.179 --> 1904.6000000000001
foreign

1907.84 --> 1912.32
like pretty blatantly for over a hundred

1911.179 --> 1914.679
years

1912.32 --> 1917.6
They're Gonna Take It and probably

1914.679 --> 1920.779
military industrial complex is going to

1917.6 --> 1922.82
be exposed and like they're gonna show

1920.779 --> 1925.46
what's actually happening in all those

1922.82 --> 1927.4399999999998
classified bunkers and [ __ ]

1925.46 --> 1929.779
and it's going to be

1927.44 --> 1933.2
absolutely insane

1929.779 --> 1936.399
not even like oh weapons secret no it's

1933.2 --> 1939.6200000000001
going to be like unbelievable

1936.399 --> 1941.36
like beyond your imagination demonic

1939.62 --> 1943.34
torture [ __ ]

1941.36 --> 1945.1399999999999
to test

1943.34 --> 1947.0
like

1945.14 --> 1949.159
because what they've probably been

1947.0 --> 1952.88
working on the most and has been the

1949.159 --> 1952.88
most uh horrific

1953.179 --> 1959.659
egregious

1954.86 --> 1963.02
is like visceral studies at just pure

1959.659 --> 1966.49
like control like not even mind control

1963.02 --> 1968.899
but just full spectrum control over life

1966.49 --> 1972.14
[Music]

1968.899 --> 1974.1789999999999
how to like perfectly control like a

1972.14 --> 1976.1000000000001
room like you could literally turn human

1974.179 --> 1978.6200000000001
into a robot

1976.1 --> 1979.9399999999998
in every factor and then like to the

1978.62 --> 1983.84
level where they wouldn't even know it

1979.94 --> 1987.3200000000002
it's this is the MK Ultra but like way

1983.84 --> 1989.299
more advanced and insane and it will be

1987.32 --> 1992.36
connected up with like oh yeah they have

1989.299 --> 1995.12
to do certain genetic modifications and

1992.36 --> 1998.0
then people become really susceptible to

1995.12 --> 2001.4799999999998
this and this type of radio wave and

1998.0 --> 2004.419
yeah and think of that like on a daily

2001.48 --> 2007.419
basis for 50 years

2004.419 --> 2008.6200000000001
and with actual just torture situations

2007.419 --> 2011.8600000000001
and

2008.62 --> 2014.559
just to figure out everything I think

2011.86 --> 2017.4599999999998
that that's probably gonna

2014.559 --> 2017.46
come out of that

2022.48 --> 2025.919
because yeah I mean

2028.6 --> 2031.799
because that's what they're doing

2032.44 --> 2034.6200000000001
thank you

2034.659 --> 2040.2600000000002
hello Fubar and George Sanford good to

2038.08 --> 2040.26
see you

2058.419 --> 2065.74
push NATO the earthquake yeah

2062.2 --> 2069.1589999999997
it's weather Warfare I mean they're just

2065.74 --> 2072.6389999999997
using it it's a full on demonic control

2069.159 --> 2074.7400000000002
they have those weapons

2072.639 --> 2077.7400000000002
and they're ready to just like a death

2074.74 --> 2080.2599999999998
star just they're gonna get to the point

2077.74 --> 2083.1589999999997
where they're ready to just like level

2080.26 --> 2083.159
places

2092.56 --> 2096.879
so I bet that right like these things

2094.899 --> 2099.22
are not even too much up front in my

2096.879 --> 2100.66
Consciousness as to like where where are

2099.22 --> 2102.8799999999997
these devices

2100.66 --> 2105.72
because that's going to be a priority to

2102.88 --> 2105.7200000000003
take them all out

2108.64 --> 2113.02
I mean after this is over like literally

2111.64 --> 2115.96
weather weapons are going to be

2113.02 --> 2118.42
internationally completely illegal

2115.96 --> 2120.46
and those sites are going to be all

2118.42 --> 2124.44
condemned

2120.46 --> 2124.44
all the harp [ __ ] all of it

2127.359 --> 2135.839
it should be because it's just massive

2130.48 --> 2135.839
amount of technological power abuse like

2137.8 --> 2143.38
is just too dangerous to even have that

2140.26 --> 2145.6600000000003
around with people that are this demonic

2143.38 --> 2149.339
like in general even if it wasn't in

2145.66 --> 2149.339
their hands it's just like no

2151.359 --> 2153.839
anyway

2155.8 --> 2162.099
demonic clown show and then Grammys

2160.0 --> 2167.2
I mean

2162.099 --> 2170.6800000000003
wow dude I've seen that like this is the

2167.2 --> 2173.9199999999996
first time no no it's not dude

2170.68 --> 2175.839
hello that was 10 years ago they did

2173.92 --> 2178.3
[ __ ] like that I mean what's so special

2175.839 --> 2181.119
about this oh now you're seeing it all

2178.3 --> 2183.6400000000003
of a sudden dude they literally did [ __ ]

2181.119 --> 2185.98
like that with the red with the stupid

2183.64 --> 2188.3799999999997
devil horns and [ __ ]

2185.98 --> 2190.3
ten years ago it was right there like

2188.38 --> 2192.1600000000003
what are you talking about oh no look at

2190.3 --> 2194.619
what they've done that [ __ ] [ __ ] 10

2192.16 --> 2196.5989999999997
years ago what are you whining about

2194.619 --> 2199.359
what you didn't notice it you thought it

2196.599 --> 2202.38
was cute then yeah it was the same

2199.359 --> 2202.38
like what what's

2203.82 --> 2209.04
it's the same [ __ ] this is nothing new

2219.4 --> 2223.2400000000002
I mean yeah it's being paraded around oh

2221.8 --> 2226.7200000000003
look at what they're doing it's so

2223.24 --> 2229.1189999999997
blatant like yeah yeah well what's

2226.72 --> 2231.2799999999997
blatant then 10 years ago

2229.119 --> 2233.56
except nobody everybody thought it was

2231.28 --> 2237.6400000000003
kind of cute or something

2233.56 --> 2242.38
or just like oh they're just pretending

2237.64 --> 2244.96
but it was just as bad guys it was just

2242.38 --> 2246.88
as bad as this thing

2244.96 --> 2248.68
that's that stupid

2246.88 --> 2253.7400000000002
red lighted

2248.68 --> 2253.74
devil clown act that's just as bad

2258.7 --> 2265.54
so so why is it all different now it's

2262.54 --> 2269.44
the same don't you see it it's the same

2265.54 --> 2272.68
that [ __ ] was right there 10 years ago

2269.44 --> 2276.16
right remember I remember like when

2272.68 --> 2278.68
Madonna got all crazy

2276.16 --> 2282.22
like weird demonic with Egyptian

2278.68 --> 2284.3799999999997
symbolism I mean that was 10 years ago

2282.22 --> 2286.9199999999996
or something or more

2284.38 --> 2286.92
so

2290.2 --> 2298.2
what's so different now

2293.5 --> 2298.2
The Alex Jones was right meme is fact

2298.48 --> 2302.68
yeah fine hello by the way LSG good to

2300.82 --> 2305.38
see you

2302.68 --> 2308.339
okay Alex Jones was definitely right

2305.38 --> 2308.339
like

2308.68 --> 2312.839
13 years ago absolutely

2326.92 --> 2332.2000000000003
but yeah after the whole Sandy Hook

2329.26 --> 2335.98
scenario happened

2332.2 --> 2337.359
like him interacting with that like I

2335.98 --> 2340.599
think that's the point where just

2337.359 --> 2344.04
everything turned to [ __ ] like he turned

2340.599 --> 2347.44
to [ __ ] after that before that it was

2344.04 --> 2350.56
amazing like pretty much everything and

2347.44 --> 2352.42
after that like everything went wrong

2350.56 --> 2355.56
he went wrong there's something went

2352.42 --> 2355.56
wrong with Alex himself

2356.44 --> 2362.7400000000002
he started to act really weird

2359.56 --> 2364.72
and more hassle in the background that

2362.74 --> 2366.2799999999997
you didn't hear on his show about

2364.72 --> 2369.16
but like

2366.28 --> 2371.619
the heavy arguments like with the crew

2369.16 --> 2374.0789999999997
and [ __ ] happened pretty much around

2371.619 --> 2377.099
that time

2374.079 --> 2377.099
and afterward

2379.0 --> 2383.74
and he's never really been to the same

2381.579 --> 2386.4
quality level he's just kind of a

2383.74 --> 2386.3999999999996
blabber now

2386.44 --> 2391.54
although it still has interesting

2388.78 --> 2393.28
sources at times and you just pick up on

2391.54 --> 2395.5
some interesting things

2393.28 --> 2399.52
but I mean

2395.5 --> 2403.079
the quality is just nothing close to

2399.52 --> 2403.079
what it was like 13 years ago

2404.2 --> 2409.4399999999996
it's it's literally dumbed down

2409.54 --> 2416.02
and he's just lit like yelling in your

2412.72 --> 2419.9199999999996
face I'm perfectly honest I can do it

2416.02 --> 2423.099
just exactly it's it's such he's just

2419.92 --> 2426.4
yelling lying to your face it's really

2423.099 --> 2428.92
[ __ ] gross I mean it's gross

2426.4 --> 2431.26
gross as in it really makes me want to

2428.92 --> 2434.2000000000003
punch him for personal reasons because I

2431.26 --> 2436.6600000000003
just know he is lying and he's being

2434.2 --> 2438.8799999999997
loud because he knows he's lying and

2436.66 --> 2442.66
he's just lying looking in the camera

2438.88 --> 2445.54
lying lying to himself he is so [ __ ]

2442.66 --> 2447.3999999999996
up Alex is really [ __ ] up in the head

2445.54 --> 2450.579
guys

2447.4 --> 2452.92
because he does actually lie and he

2450.579 --> 2455.579
keeps lying and he hides that he lies

2452.92 --> 2455.579
from himself

2457.599 --> 2459.599
um

2463.48 --> 2466.079
foreign

2466.619 --> 2471.599
probably he can't stop it he just can't

2469.96 --> 2474.28
stop himself

2471.599 --> 2476.76
he is just getting more and more

2474.28 --> 2476.76
Grappler

2477.52 --> 2481.9
getting more compulsive with bad

2479.5 --> 2485.099
impulses

2481.9 --> 2485.099
it's very tragic really

2497.94 --> 2504.7200000000003
who Alex Jones

2500.92 --> 2504.7200000000003
people you don't really care about

2505.78 --> 2510.5400000000004
that I follow him for a long time still

2508.06 --> 2510.54
kind of do

2516.76 --> 2521.1400000000003
the most shot out

2519.28 --> 2524.6400000000003
what does that mean

2521.14 --> 2524.64
I don't know that expression

2533.32 --> 2536.32
problems

2545.8 --> 2549.88
low build Evolution could you clarify

2548.26 --> 2552.3590000000004
what you mean I don't understand what

2549.88 --> 2552.359
that means

2554.8 --> 2558.94
you mean like worn out

2556.96 --> 2562.5
or something

2558.94 --> 2562.5
because he does look worn out

2577.48 --> 2584.28
or just don't whatever

2581.26 --> 2584.28
anyway hello

2593.38 --> 2598.319
such beautiful weather still

2599.319 --> 2605.5
it's a line

2602.56 --> 2608.94
from due date okay

2605.5 --> 2608.94
I don't know about that

2613.48 --> 2616.98
isn't that just amazing looking

2617.68 --> 2619.9199999999996
foreign

2633.18 --> 2636.7799999999997
oh okay

2643.119 --> 2647.04
maybe I don't know

2647.92 --> 2652.3
I don't know maybe I think that he's

2650.14 --> 2655.9
just

2652.3 --> 2657.88
he just grows older I mean he where it

2655.9 --> 2661.42
is worn out right

2657.88 --> 2663.76
he burns himself out or keeps himself

2661.42 --> 2666.66
like high tension all the time so he's

2663.76 --> 2666.6600000000003
basically just

2667.68 --> 2672.46
overburdening himself continually most

2670.839 --> 2675.2799999999997
of his life

2672.46 --> 2677.819
you get literally physically age from

2675.28 --> 2677.8190000000004
doing that

2688.599 --> 2691.6800000000003
hello Cleary

2696.78 --> 2701.8590000000004
right here's another thing

2700.319 --> 2705.18
lying

2701.859 --> 2705.18
to your face

2706.319 --> 2711.88
and to yourself and then like on a grand

2709.839 --> 2715.619
scale

2711.88 --> 2715.619
also ages you

2722.5 --> 2725.22
foreign

2750.28 --> 2753.1800000000003
uh

2770.14 --> 2772.98
right anyway

2775.0 --> 2780.76
that's what I've been watching

2777.76 --> 2780.76
foreign

2781.0 --> 2786.839
Alex Jones is like he isn't even on that

2784.66 --> 2786.839
much

2787.839 --> 2793.02
he's like on maybe

2789.76 --> 2793.0200000000004
two days a week

2793.06 --> 2797.44
and the rest he just leaves it to the

2795.22 --> 2800.04
rest of his crew to take over like

2797.44 --> 2800.04
seriously

2801.099 --> 2806.02
and it's weird because then he starts

2803.2 --> 2808.359
saying like oh when I come on we get

2806.02 --> 2810.46
better viewings

2808.359 --> 2813.72
I don't even know if that's necessary it

2810.46 --> 2813.7200000000003
probably is true but

2814.38 --> 2820.7200000000003
he's not doing it as much and I don't

2818.859 --> 2822.94
know what he's doing with all that time

2820.72 --> 2826.2
in between

2822.94 --> 2826.2000000000003
I have no idea

2826.78 --> 2831.599
it's probably working but I don't know

2828.88 --> 2831.599
what kind of work

2839.52 --> 2846.339
but yeah I mean I do really miss the old

2842.98 --> 2849.52
days because in 2010 Alex Jones would

2846.339 --> 2852.0
like be on all the time he would

2849.52 --> 2857.579
literally do four

2852.0 --> 2857.579
our live shows all the way

2858.28 --> 2865.9
was very heavy on him though but I mean

2861.339 --> 2870.0
those were like really amazing shows

2865.9 --> 2870.0
where he was really true

2872.8 --> 2876.8390000000004
in a way you could almost say that

2878.079 --> 2884.6800000000003
part of me is kind of like based even on

2882.28 --> 2886.5400000000004
what I experienced with him just keep

2884.68 --> 2889.0
going because he was like I'm against

2886.54 --> 2890.92
the entire world

2889.0 --> 2893.619
well that's kind of what it felt like

2890.92 --> 2896.02
for me starting up

2893.619 --> 2897.94
like my YouTube channel and going live

2896.02 --> 2901.0
it's like I'm against the entire world

2897.94 --> 2903.16
so yeah Alex Jones the earlier one it's

2901.0 --> 2904.18
been a really big inspiration to me in

2903.16 --> 2908.52
that

2904.18 --> 2908.52
like an example of courage and tenacity

2909.339 --> 2917.14
but what he's doing now is just uh

2914.14 --> 2920.319
he's just gross now so many times and

2917.14 --> 2924.4
some of his ads are just so egregious

2920.319 --> 2927.579
they're so like like oh

2924.4 --> 2931.56
like makes my skin crawl

2927.579 --> 2935.079
or itch like acutely from just

2931.56 --> 2936.52
witnessing that it's just like ah

2935.079 --> 2939.54
stop

2936.52 --> 2939.54
just stop

2946.18 --> 2948.72
anyway

2954.4 --> 2962.2200000000003
just go dancing in the pool with a brew

2958.72 --> 2962.22
that sounds really gay

2991.96 --> 2996.06
right okay blue build evolution

3006.18 --> 3009.18
okay

3009.599 --> 3015.06
well it might be invigorating to you but

3011.88 --> 3019.1600000000003
I mean disco dancing

3015.06 --> 3019.16
already but in the pool

3020.64 --> 3026.24
I mean that kind of sounds like disco

3022.44 --> 3026.2400000000002
dancing on Rollerblades

3026.46 --> 3030.359
it's just

3028.56 --> 3033.42
I'm sorry

3030.359 --> 3035.64
I tend to like overly associate disco

3033.42 --> 3038.76
with gay

3035.64 --> 3041.0
excuse me if you happen to really like

3038.76 --> 3041.0
Disco

3041.4 --> 3044.9
I don't I just

3045.48 --> 3049.859
it always reminds me of gay [ __ ] every

3048.9 --> 3052.94
time

3049.859 --> 3052.94
I can't help it

3053.28 --> 3056.3790000000004
[Music]

3058.44 --> 3064.079
and you have to also recognize that

3060.72 --> 3068.819
there was like a big push

3064.079 --> 3071.52
for gay like within the disco scene

3068.819 --> 3073.2599999999998
like really

3071.52 --> 3077.48
they

3073.26 --> 3077.48
they played into it all the time

3089.4 --> 3092.4
anyways

3093.18 --> 3099.1189999999997
look if you grew up in that then you

3095.7 --> 3102.0589999999997
just kind of like that I get it I'm not

3099.119 --> 3104.099
gonna try to tell you that you're you're

3102.059 --> 3105.96
automatically gay just because you

3104.099 --> 3108.7400000000002
happen to like that

3105.96 --> 3108.7400000000002
uh-huh

3110.46 --> 3115.579
don't score up yeah well it's cool

3112.859 --> 3115.5789999999997
Rock's pretty cool

3121.859 --> 3126.619
I just don't like disco I really don't

3131.46 --> 3135.9
I mean there's like some songs that are

3134.16 --> 3138.24
like kind of fun

3135.9 --> 3140.579
in a way but it's always like yeah just

3138.24 --> 3143.7599999999998
keep it short I I don't want to like

3140.579 --> 3146.04
keep listening to that for like

3143.76 --> 3148.559
more than a few minutes

3146.04 --> 3150.0589999999997
and then I'm like yeah now something

3148.559 --> 3154.099
else thanks

3150.059 --> 3154.099
right that's usually my response

3159.78 --> 3166.6800000000003
do that disco dance what

3163.68 --> 3166.68
okay

3168.3 --> 3173.52
so you're like it

3170.46 --> 3177.619
a bit of a dance choreography guy like

3173.52 --> 3177.619
that and like special moves

3181.079 --> 3187.94
okay anyway let's just I'll just leave

3183.72 --> 3187.9399999999996
you to that you have fun with that

3190.87 --> 3193.949
[Music]

3194.339 --> 3198.72
in the meantime I'll be listening to

3196.079 --> 3201.2400000000002
mine in a box over and over again and

3198.72 --> 3203.54
every time I hear the songs

3201.24 --> 3207.359
I have new

3203.54 --> 3209.52
fractal different insights about it

3207.359 --> 3214.2
that's music I can do something with

3209.52 --> 3216.3
beautiful and multi-meaning like a lot

3214.2 --> 3218.0989999999997
of different meanings a lot of different

3216.3 --> 3219.9
angle of approaches like you can listen

3218.099 --> 3222.9
to one song

3219.9 --> 3226.319
and listen like from the victim point of

3222.9 --> 3230.46
view and then from the like

3226.319 --> 3233.94
the one actually doing something evil

3230.46 --> 3236.7
from a few like this same song you can

3233.94 --> 3237.9
hear it from all sides with some of

3236.7 --> 3240.66
these like

3237.9 --> 3243.6600000000003
that's the music that I listen to

3240.66 --> 3246.66
mind in the Box amazing

3243.66 --> 3246.66
amazing

3247.559 --> 3252.42
the guy is like the guy that writes

3250.74 --> 3255.4399999999996
that makes that

3252.42 --> 3255.44
is a genius

3257.4 --> 3264.859
or at least he has like real moments of

3260.04 --> 3264.859
Genius Musical and psychological genius

3268.079 --> 3273.48
I mean not all of mine in the boxes

3270.48 --> 3277.319
songs are like really super cool

3273.48 --> 3280.02
but most of them are are cool and some

3277.319 --> 3283.819
of them are just freaking brilliant and

3280.02 --> 3283.819
those brilliant ones I collected them

3284.64 --> 3289.6189999999997
you like any boards what I don't even

3287.94 --> 3291.96
know what that means

3330.3 --> 3337.619
from preliminary photos that pop up I'd

3334.8 --> 3341.0
say the could be kind of interesting

3337.619 --> 3341.0
I've never heard of that

3342.5 --> 3347.4
Scottish Canadian

3345.72 --> 3350.04
Duo

3347.4 --> 3353.7200000000003
electronic music yeah it could be sort

3350.04 --> 3353.72
of in the same direction I guess

3357.119 --> 3365.1600000000003
there are videos or there YouTube music

3361.38 --> 3367.26
videos I think out there

it could be good I like some of the

3533.579 --> 3536.42
comments

3536.46 --> 3541.26
I mean saying it aged well that is a

3539.579 --> 3544.4
promising sign there's not a lot of

3541.26 --> 3544.4
music out there that

3546.24 --> 3552.1189999999997
that can be sent off so yeah thanks blue

3550.319 --> 3556.64
pill Devolution I will definitely check

3552.119 --> 3556.6400000000003
it out well somewhere today probably

3557.119 --> 3564.1800000000003
when I ran never heard of it

3561.18 --> 3564.18
foreign

3566.66 --> 3571.2799999999997
a box

3568.68 --> 3571.2799999999997
okay

3573.96 --> 3577.52
mine in the box is like

3577.559 --> 3580.7000000000003
check or something

3582.78 --> 3587.28
from

3584.579 --> 3589.9700000000003
east Europe

3587.28 --> 3591.119
uh

3589.97 --> 3593.819
[Music]

3591.119 --> 3596.299
I'll try to find you like well my

3593.819 --> 3596.299
favorite song

3611.099 --> 3616.559
I've shared it a couple of times

3614.16 --> 3620.18
Between Worlds

3616.559 --> 3620.1800000000003
that's my number one song

3620.579 --> 3625.559
another really good one is also cause

3623.52 --> 3627.42
and effect it's pretty literally my

3625.559 --> 3630.44
number two song

3627.42 --> 3630.44
I don't know

3633.56 --> 3636.849
[Music]

3645.63 --> 3650.579
[Music]

3646.94 --> 3652.5
these two songs are mind-blowing yeah

3650.579 --> 3655.1400000000003
and yeah the Third

3652.5 --> 3657.18
is control

3655.14 --> 3659.7
and that yeah and there's another one

3657.18 --> 3663.359
that I tend to listen to a little bit

3659.7 --> 3666.96
less but like these three songs are

3663.359 --> 3668.5789999999997
like surreal in how many ways you can

3666.96 --> 3670.26
actually interpret what is being

3668.579 --> 3672.799
discussed

3670.26 --> 3676.7400000000002
it's like this

3672.799 --> 3679.38
fractal interdimensional mirror is what

3676.74 --> 3680.3999999999996
their songs are like contemplations and

3679.38 --> 3682.819
you can

3680.4 --> 3682.819
just

3683.339 --> 3687.18
from so many different perspectives it's

3685.619 --> 3689.9
crazy

3687.18 --> 3689.8999999999996
uh

3700.559 --> 3702.7400000000002
foreign

3720.96 --> 3725.099
these are pretty much the songs that I

3723.24 --> 3726.4799999999996
typically listen to right before I start

3725.099 --> 3730.52
the show

3726.48 --> 3730.52
because they really helped me Focus

3732.24 --> 3734.359
thank you

3736.38 --> 3741.6600000000003
in a way I wish I could play them like

3738.9 --> 3745.44
even as part of my show but

3741.66 --> 3748.0989999999997
I'll probably they're still out there

3745.44 --> 3748.099
and I mean

3749.579 --> 3756.54
I wouldn't be able to like without like

3753.18 --> 3758.5789999999997
paying them my monetization at least

3756.54 --> 3761.94
and I don't even know if the guy would

3758.579 --> 3764.04
want to he might actually not like flat

3761.94 --> 3767.2200000000003
earthers at all

3764.04 --> 3769.4
or is against being open about it or

3767.22 --> 3769.3999999999996
something

3769.98 --> 3778.619
because this guy knows [ __ ] he knows

3776.04 --> 3780.7799999999997
like you can tell from what he's talking

3778.619 --> 3783.48
about in the songs you can absolutely

3780.78 --> 3785.1600000000003
tell he knows

3783.48 --> 3787.579
or what he's gonna do with it is another

3785.16 --> 3787.5789999999997
matter

3787.98 --> 3793.7400000000002
and he is a bit of a he is like a bit of

3791.64 --> 3800.339
a transhumanism

3793.74 --> 3803.64
but like more like I am as in not oh

3800.339 --> 3806.2799999999997
we're neat humans are not like a

3803.64 --> 3808.2
[ __ ] Evolution based idea that all

3806.28 --> 3810.1800000000003
humans are outdated or machines are

3808.2 --> 3812.64
gonna take over and

3810.18 --> 3815.2799999999997
and getting all eugenicists I don't

3812.64 --> 3817.68
think he's like that

3815.28 --> 3820.28
but he is like he does have his own

3817.68 --> 3820.2799999999997
ideas

3826.7 --> 3832.6189999999997
I mean I really hope he isn't actually

3830.04 --> 3834.0589999999997
secretly a eugenesis never overtly

3832.619 --> 3836.76
anyway

3834.059 --> 3840.1400000000003
now he hasn't because it would shine

3836.76 --> 3840.1400000000003
through in his songs and it doesn't

3841.619 --> 3845.7200000000003
you might be just fascinated by it

3846.96 --> 3851.94
which I was especially when it was in my

3850.02 --> 3855.96
teens not so much and no more now

3851.94 --> 3857.4
because now I just see like yeah but

3855.96 --> 3860.339
it's like

3857.4 --> 3862.799
why would you need to upgrade when the

3860.339 --> 3866.64
human body is basically the most amazing

3862.799 --> 3870.24
piece of technology ever invented

3866.64 --> 3873.48
not without flaws but still

3870.24 --> 3877.16
so in that I'm like transhumanist in a

3873.48 --> 3880.14
sense that I believe that we've highly

3877.16 --> 3883.859
underestimated the power of God's

3880.14 --> 3885.96
creation and ourselves in that sense I'm

3883.859 --> 3887.18
a transhumanist because I think that

3885.96 --> 3890.28
we've been

3887.18 --> 3892.2
downplaying our own

3890.28 --> 3896.599
value

3892.2 --> 3896.5989999999997
like all of humanity and all of life

3901.14 --> 3907.5
and I do think that we have like a

3905.7 --> 3910.5
unique opportunity because of the

3907.5 --> 3912.599
Internet and mobile communication

3910.5 --> 3914.819
to connect up

3912.599 --> 3915.9
in ways that weren't really possible

3914.819 --> 3918.42
before

3915.9 --> 3921.5
and that that is also a part of

3918.42 --> 3921.5
spiritual evolution

3921.54 --> 3927.24
which I do think exists not bodily but

3924.66 --> 3929.819
spiritual Evolution so there is this

3927.24 --> 3932.339
thing there is a spirit thing happening

3929.819 --> 3934.5589999999997
and I think that transhumanism is really

3932.339 --> 3937.2599999999998
about well that

3934.559 --> 3941.1800000000003
but the spiritual Ascension

3937.26 --> 3941.1800000000003
also because of Technology

3941.579 --> 3944.94
is weird

3943.38 --> 3946.619
there's something there something

3944.94 --> 3948.9
happening guys something that has been

3946.619 --> 3951.119
happening for long there's been a lot of

3948.9 --> 3953.88
focus on oh look at what we've all lost

3951.119 --> 3957.9
but also look at how things have changed

3953.88 --> 3961.38
and how people's abilities have changed

3957.9 --> 3964.28
quite dramatically compared to like a

3961.38 --> 3964.28
hundred years ago

3969.9 --> 3975.96
for this whole instrumental for example

3972.96 --> 3975.96
okay

3977.7 --> 3980.4199999999996
foreign

4005.18 --> 4009.98
right but I guess that

4007.579 --> 4012.38
if I'm gonna say things like I'm a

4009.98 --> 4015.2
transhumanist I'm gonna have to be very

4012.38 --> 4018.2000000000003
specific about it I believe that

4015.2 --> 4020.7799999999997
the exact opposite of eugenesis

4018.2 --> 4024.5
transhumanism where it's like oh the

4020.78 --> 4028.1600000000003
flesh is too weak we we can

4024.5 --> 4030.859
become more with machines

4028.16 --> 4032.1189999999997
like that like that's even possible with

4030.859 --> 4034.2799999999997
the consciousness

4032.119 --> 4036.26
I believe exactly the opposite I believe

4034.28 --> 4039.5
that

4036.26 --> 4042.559
machines will actually just take away

4039.5 --> 4045.46
from our natural design

4042.559 --> 4045.46
abilities

4045.559 --> 4051.7400000000002
and that we have much more potential

4047.78 --> 4055.1600000000003
within our flesh

4051.74 --> 4057.5
then we take granted for and it's part

4055.16 --> 4060.5789999999997
of because of false teachings because of

4057.5 --> 4060.579
evolution teachings

4061.16 --> 4066.319
and Atheism and heliocentrism

4066.859 --> 4072.2599999999998
all those things are reversed World

4069.619 --> 4075.46
engineering thoughts

4072.26 --> 4078.26
and it pulls you away from it

4075.46 --> 4082.9
deprioritizes your the physical reality

4078.26 --> 4082.9
and prioritizes the fantasy

4083.48 --> 4088.819
and then you will be inclined to

4085.88 --> 4091.46
basically look down upon the physicals

4088.819 --> 4092.9
like oh it's just me in reality oh this

4091.46 --> 4096.02
is stupid

4092.9 --> 4099.52
right disappointed I was so into the

4096.02 --> 4099.52
game or into the movie

4102.14 --> 4110.1990000000005
that's what it's accomplished and that

4106.279 --> 4110.1990000000005
yeah doesn't lead anywhere good

4121.1 --> 4127.06
the book will help you on the w at the

4124.58 --> 4127.0599999999995
end what

4131.66 --> 4137.3189999999995
Oh you mean save the cat

4134.02 --> 4137.319
yeah sure

4142.279 --> 4147.88
I'm looking forward to

4144.62 --> 4147.88
to reading through this

4151.58 --> 4156.259
it's kind of funny also because there

4153.679 --> 4160.819
are like actual movie examples in there

4156.259 --> 4164.5
and those are movies that I do know so

4160.819 --> 4164.5
that's going to be very helpful

4175.239 --> 4180.678999999999
a good start for me okay I don't know

4179.42 --> 4183.16
about that but it's going to be

4180.679 --> 4183.16
interesting

4186.81 --> 4190.089000000001
[Music]

4191.299 --> 4193.839
thank you

4208.8 --> 4211.89
[Music]

4224.0 --> 4229.42
maybe I'll call this non-reversed world

4226.52 --> 4229.42
transhumanism

4232.58 --> 4237.199
or maybe I'll call it theist

4234.38 --> 4239.2390000000005
transhumanism

4237.199 --> 4241.48
that should definitely trigger some

4239.239 --> 4241.48
people

4246.4 --> 4249.61
[Music]

4257.239 --> 4262.659
hmm

4259.82 --> 4262.659
yep

4264.92 --> 4268.76
yep we have not seen followed by the

4266.659 --> 4271.4
literally list around for a while well

4268.76 --> 4273.26
she's she seemed to have like abandoned

4271.4 --> 4276.5199999999995
fvd

4273.26 --> 4276.52
I think because of me

4277.1 --> 4284.38
but it was mostly because she was

4280.58 --> 4284.38
trans Spirit no

4288.56 --> 4293.120000000001
but

4290.0 --> 4296.36
and would have two s's but

4293.12 --> 4299.62
I mean spiritualism is pretty much

4296.36 --> 4303.199
already that so that's like

4299.62 --> 4305.38
unnecessarily double meaning

4303.199 --> 4308.36
at the same it's just

4305.38 --> 4310.88
yeah you could call it spiritualism but

4308.36 --> 4313.719
I like theist transhumanism

4310.88 --> 4313.719
because that's

4314.6 --> 4321.620000000001
it is like reference to transhumanism

4317.659 --> 4324.139999999999
it's just the other the exact opposite

4321.62 --> 4325.82
side to it because the transhumanism

4324.14 --> 4327.860000000001
that everybody knows about is the

4325.82 --> 4330.139999999999
atheist one where nothing matters about

4327.86 --> 4331.82
the evolution of humanity and all we're

4330.14 --> 4334.820000000001
outdated oh look at how weaken our

4331.82 --> 4338.12
diseases yeah that you literally caused

4334.82 --> 4341.32
through poisoning unnecessarily and

4338.12 --> 4341.32
through your belief

4341.48 --> 4348.0199999999995
that we are so much better

4345.08 --> 4352.04
as beings and our capabilities than our

4348.02 --> 4353.120000000001
ancestors 100 or 200 300 years ago

4352.04 --> 4356.48
right

4353.12 --> 4358.96
but I do believe in like spiritual

4356.48 --> 4358.959999999999
evolution

4361.219 --> 4368.3
and a Transcendence of humanity but

4365.3 --> 4370.04
with God I think that it was always it's

4368.3 --> 4373.84
part of the design it's part with of

4370.04 --> 4373.84
what humans do as part of the cycle

4375.92 --> 4382.52
and this is one of those moments

4379.699 --> 4386.0
I think every Empire that becomes really

4382.52 --> 4387.76
great and strong has those effects in

4386.0 --> 4390.26
them

4387.76 --> 4393.46
counterbalanced by the darkness of the

4390.26 --> 4393.46
powers actually in control

4398.3 --> 4402.26
and then you have a sleepers versus

4400.28 --> 4407.0599999999995
Awakening

4402.26 --> 4411.7390000000005
front polarized situation every single

4407.06 --> 4414.56
time that happens unavoidable

4411.739 --> 4416.9
every single time

4414.56 --> 4420.1
will always be those that completely

4416.9 --> 4420.099999999999
reject all of it

4432.08 --> 4437.78
all right but anyway clear it like

4435.44 --> 4439.759999999999
she's not really hanging around fed but

4437.78 --> 4442.0599999999995
she's still doing her own streams I

4439.76 --> 4442.06
don't know

4455.3 --> 4460.46
so yeah by the way blue pill is a weird

4457.699 --> 4464.739
thing to say would love you to see you

4460.46 --> 4464.7390000000005
succeed I mean succeed at what

4465.92 --> 4468.92
foreign

4470.44 --> 4477.5
Movie Maker does that make me a success

4475.04 --> 4479.42
I don't get it I mean I'm gonna learn

4477.5 --> 4481.54
something from that book

4479.42 --> 4483.679
but

4481.54 --> 4486.679
succeed at what

4483.679 --> 4489.1990000000005
I mean do I have a plan

4486.679 --> 4491.84
to do something and I got that book in

4489.199 --> 4494.178999999999
order to achieve it yeah well then that

4491.84 --> 4496.34
would make sense what you said

4494.179 --> 4499.659
but I'm just reading the book I don't

4496.34 --> 4499.659000000001
have a plan to do anything

4502.58 --> 4506.3
like I don't even know if this is really

4504.679 --> 4510.08
something that

4506.3 --> 4512.179
I can do something with really

4510.08 --> 4514.719
maybe I'll get really bored with it

4512.179 --> 4514.719
quickly

4516.26 --> 4521.2390000000005
or maybe I'll get very inspired and just

4518.84 --> 4524.6
like try out like oh I want to just do a

4521.239 --> 4528.0199999999995
screenplay just see like what is this

4524.6 --> 4530.0
how easy is it how good am I at it I

4528.02 --> 4532.040000000001
don't know we'll see just have to read

4530.0 --> 4534.76
it first I haven't even read like a full

4532.04 --> 4534.76
page so

4548.96 --> 4555.52
okay blue build Evolution fine I know

4551.9 --> 4555.5199999999995
you meant it and well it's just that

4556.04 --> 4558.82
has a weird

4559.46 --> 4565.9
it's just weird spiritual metadata that

4562.04 --> 4565.9
comes with formulating things like that

4578.0 --> 4582.92
right because

4579.98 --> 4585.5599999999995
it sort of implies that I'm not

4582.92 --> 4587.659
like so I'm not successful am I not

4585.56 --> 4590.0
successful well by what standard am I

4587.659 --> 4593.48
not successful yeah I'm not the biggest

4590.0 --> 4596.36
YouTuber on YouTube yeah duh

4593.48 --> 4599.36
how would I ever accomplish that

4596.36 --> 4601.639999999999
well I'd have to just do absolutely

4599.36 --> 4605.139999999999
everything exactly the opposite of

4601.64 --> 4605.14
everything that I'm doing pretty much

4608.6 --> 4615.320000000001
but even if I do that now it wouldn't

4611.96 --> 4617.78
matter I would have had to have done

4615.32 --> 4619.28
everything completely different like

4617.78 --> 4621.139999999999
from the start of my pretty much my

4619.28 --> 4623.3
entire life even to get to such a

4621.14 --> 4625.159000000001
position I will not get to such a

4623.3 --> 4628.52
position within YouTube

4625.159 --> 4631.78
don't expect that unless like

4628.52 --> 4635.5
I don't know the Beast let's go of it

4631.78 --> 4635.5
like that's gonna happen

4642.8 --> 4647.900000000001
but I mean with what I'm doing I feel

4645.44 --> 4650.259999999999
that I am successful I'm learning a lot

4647.9 --> 4650.259999999999
of skill

4650.6 --> 4655.64
I'm persistent

4652.699 --> 4659.12
I set out to do this every day and I am

4655.64 --> 4660.56
doing it every day and recently I'm like

4659.12 --> 4664.099999999999
cleaning up

4660.56 --> 4667.06
no more alcohol no more coffee for a

4664.1 --> 4667.06
while and no more tea

4671.12 --> 4676.88
and I am really by the way noticing a

4674.0 --> 4679.179
huge difference in that sense also well

4676.88 --> 4679.179
Financial

4679.699 --> 4685.58
right

4682.1 --> 4689.06
I've been effectively less panicky like

4685.58 --> 4691.219
help me I need donations right now

4689.06 --> 4693.679
because

4691.219 --> 4696.86
well I still do need him I mean I

4693.679 --> 4699.159
seriously do but it's just a lot easier

4696.86 --> 4699.159
now

4704.719 --> 4708.46
I smoke less cannabis

4708.5 --> 4712.28
I don't like have to go to the grocery

4710.84 --> 4716.860000000001
store

4712.28 --> 4716.86
every day or two days to get beer

4729.1 --> 4734.780000000001
generalizing movies so you put it in

4731.36 --> 4737.0
yeah no it's good no look even if just

4734.78 --> 4738.86
for that it could be useful I mean to

4737.0 --> 4741.8
just

4738.86 --> 4743.839999999999
well when I do movie reviews I mean it's

4741.8 --> 4745.6990000000005
not even much of a review it's just I

4743.84 --> 4747.92
kind of quickly summarize what I think

4745.699 --> 4749.839999999999
about it sometimes I might lay out

4747.92 --> 4751.4800000000005
scenes but I even try to avoid that

4749.84 --> 4755.62
because I don't want to spoil things

4751.48 --> 4755.62
unless it's like an older movie

4757.52 --> 4763.6990000000005
but even for just that process it'll

4761.6 --> 4766.400000000001
help me

4763.699 --> 4768.739
better my analysis

4766.4 --> 4771.219
of better more professional references

4768.739 --> 4771.218999999999
probably

4773.36 --> 4777.32
better use of words in relation to movie

4776.239 --> 4779.36
making

4777.32 --> 4783.199
even though I've already picked up a

4779.36 --> 4785.659
couple of words just over the years that

4783.199 --> 4789.46
I do use anyway

4785.659 --> 4789.46
that's not music what

4794.719 --> 4799.46
what what do you mean

4797.6 --> 4801.14
what are you talking about

4799.46 --> 4802.82
go ahead and occur

4801.14 --> 4807.6990000000005
what the hell does that have to do with

4802.82 --> 4807.699
anything that anybody said or me

4823.46 --> 4828.219
music is supposed to make you happy

4829.04 --> 4832.04
okay

4848.719 --> 4851.02
foreign

4852.64 --> 4859.9400000000005
[ __ ] like this music is supposed to

4855.92 --> 4861.8
make yet no you can choose that to like

4859.94 --> 4863.78
oh I'm only gonna listen to music that

4861.8 --> 4865.46
makes me happy because it's better for

4863.78 --> 4869.199
me or something yeah sure but that

4865.46 --> 4869.199
doesn't Define music

4874.58 --> 4880.88
I often like music when it's a bit on

4878.6 --> 4884.780000000001
tension

4880.88 --> 4886.400000000001
and a lot of mining in the Box music is

4884.78 --> 4889.28
on tension

4886.4 --> 4891.62
why is that interesting because he's

4889.28 --> 4894.98
basically putting down describing

4891.62 --> 4897.14
scenarios in those tension

4894.98 --> 4901.218999999999
that are very interesting because of

4897.14 --> 4903.62
those things pass people by when they

4901.219 --> 4906.14
happen they don't actually know what the

4903.62 --> 4907.96
[ __ ] is happening when it's happening

4906.14 --> 4911.719
mine in a box

4907.96 --> 4915.56
describes exactly what happens in those

4911.719 --> 4919.88
moments it's incredibly fascinating it

4915.56 --> 4921.34
reveals private internal workings I love

4919.88 --> 4926.06
that [ __ ]

4921.34 --> 4930.9800000000005
I do that I do that all the time and he

4926.06 --> 4934.76
does it he's done it way before

4930.98 --> 4937.58
I even got on YouTube through his music

4934.76 --> 4940.6990000000005
like

4937.58 --> 4944.96
for over 15 years

4940.699 --> 4947.0
just through music it's magical to me

4944.96 --> 4951.1
it doesn't have to always make me feel

4947.0 --> 4955.9
happy as long as it really intense

4951.1 --> 4960.219
correct insightful message

4955.9 --> 4960.219
and it does all those songs have

4971.36 --> 4976.36
whack hello dating wisdom what

4983.48 --> 4989.54
that was a noise

4986.0 --> 4993.4
that stuff will make you crazy

4989.54 --> 4993.4
what the [ __ ] dude

4998.38 --> 5002.159000000001
what are you talking about

5005.38 --> 5012.36
are you calling mine in a box noise

5009.699 --> 5012.36
bro

5030.04 --> 5032.82
right today

5041.02 --> 5047.56
dude if you're gonna say that was noise

5044.26 --> 5050.1990000000005
it would be great flatten the curve or

5047.56 --> 5053.56
anybody out there if you could actually

5050.199 --> 5056.678999999999
be specific on what you're talking about

5053.56 --> 5059.02
because we are talking about a lot of

5056.679 --> 5061.42
different music including people in chat

5059.02 --> 5064.84
referencing other music if you then just

5061.42 --> 5066.88
say that was noise then we don't know

5064.84 --> 5068.5
what the [ __ ] you're referencing where

5066.88 --> 5070.42
you're referencing music I was talking

5068.5 --> 5072.3
about where you're referencing music

5070.42 --> 5074.92
that getting wisdom was talking about

5072.3 --> 5077.1990000000005
Orinoco Rumble what the [ __ ] were you

5074.92 --> 5079.3
talking about why don't you actually be

5077.199 --> 5083.379999999999
specific if we're talking about a

5079.3 --> 5085.4800000000005
subject and not just say that song Oh

5083.38 --> 5086.7390000000005
yes that song

5085.48 --> 5089.379999999999
like

5086.739 --> 5093.419999999999
why would you expect me to understand

5089.38 --> 5093.42
what the [ __ ] you're talking about then

5094.239 --> 5097.379999999999
be specific

5109.179 --> 5113.26
yes you are so you're talking about mine

5110.92 --> 5115.6
in the Box okay well

5113.26 --> 5119.34
I'm sorry I guess you just don't have

5115.6 --> 5119.34
any taste then

5124.78 --> 5130.0599999999995
because that is the best electronic

5127.42 --> 5131.52
music pretty much that exists in my

5130.06 --> 5136.0
opinion

5131.52 --> 5138.900000000001
never met any kind of song that would be

5136.0 --> 5138.9
better than that

5139.84 --> 5144.34
although there's a really good pure

5142.12 --> 5147.54
electronic songs that don't even have

5144.34 --> 5147.54
singing in them and all that

5150.28 --> 5155.0199999999995
but I mean yeah this is

5152.5 --> 5157.86
if you don't like that well then your

5155.02 --> 5157.860000000001

5176.86 --> 5182.44
if you think that money in the Box sucks

5178.96 --> 5184.9800000000005

5182.44 --> 5184.98

5202.06 --> 5206.320000000001
freaky

5203.62 --> 5209.26
it was interesting it's not music that I

5206.32 --> 5211.659
particularly like listening to

5209.26 --> 5214.5

5211.659 --> 5214.5

[Music]

5479.739 --> 5486.178999999999
that time has been flying by the way

5482.739 --> 5486.178999999999
20 more minutes for the show

5493.36 --> 5498.179
oh

5494.62 --> 5498.179
this G also sent me

5498.76 --> 5501.900000000001
a music video

5501.94 --> 5506.379999999999
guitar

5504.04 --> 5509.199
yeah sure classical guitars can be

5506.38 --> 5511.54
amazing there's a like I'm subscribed to

5509.199 --> 5514.739
some of those even like

5511.54 --> 5514.739
guitar players

5516.219 --> 5522.1
because it can be very interesting

5518.8 --> 5525.28
I very much appreciate pure instrumental

5522.1 --> 5528.9400000000005
and classical things a lot

5525.28 --> 5533.0199999999995
but I also like electronic music

5528.94 --> 5534.5199999999995
but very specific within it I mean

5533.02 --> 5538.360000000001
from everything that's out there and

5534.52 --> 5540.780000000001
there's a lot I like like point one

5538.36 --> 5540.78
percent

5543.82 --> 5547.84
no

5545.8 --> 5551.38
less than that

5547.84 --> 5554.08
point zero one percent I there's a lot

5551.38 --> 5558.2390000000005
of really stupid garbage and it's become

5554.08 --> 5558.239
worse actually more garbage

5558.46 --> 5565.06
but there's some that is just really

5560.56 --> 5566.5
good it's always about melodic Melody is

5565.06 --> 5568.900000000001
everything to me

5566.5 --> 5573.239
in all music

5568.9 --> 5573.239
but especially in electronic music

5576.4 --> 5580.599999999999
after that

5577.659 --> 5584.0199999999995
yeah I get it

5580.6 --> 5586.42
craft work is but yeah it's fun I've

5584.02 --> 5589.120000000001
been to quite a few live performances of

5586.42 --> 5591.9400000000005
them too they've been going around a lot

5589.12 --> 5595.38
like in

5591.94 --> 5598.36
in the early 21st century a lot and

5595.38 --> 5601.92
1990s too I think but I've seen them

5598.36 --> 5601.92
several times they're pretty cool

5602.02 --> 5607.6
but it's not music that I like listening

5605.44 --> 5612.099999999999
to myself

5607.6 --> 5615.219
I've very specific taste in that

5612.1 --> 5617.1990000000005
I listen to mine in the Box

5615.219 --> 5619.719
if I'm even like

5617.199 --> 5621.58
even when we went to wave Gothic traffic

5619.719 --> 5623.56
and there's all kinds of those bands

5621.58 --> 5626.5
craft work I've seen them several times

5623.56 --> 5629.26
there pretty much every time there was a

5626.5 --> 5631.54
wave Gothic to happen in Leipzig East

5629.26 --> 5635.02
Germany

5631.54 --> 5638.88
it's an entire city with like hundreds

5635.02 --> 5642.659000000001
of locations where bands play hundreds

5638.88 --> 5645.28
in the course of four days it's crazy

5642.659 --> 5648.58
but really fascinating and like

5645.28 --> 5651.599999999999
thousands of gothics everywhere

5648.58 --> 5651.6
all kinds

5654.58 --> 5658.719
but even I would just listen mine in the

5657.52 --> 5661.4800000000005
Box

5658.719 --> 5663.88
like in between on the road

5661.48 --> 5666.638999999999
because it went there in my car and back

5663.88 --> 5667.96
it is like a eight hour drive or

5666.639 --> 5670.86
something

5667.96 --> 5670.86
very doable

5676.48 --> 5682.739
during Springtime right

5679.0 --> 5682.739
it's during a

5682.96 --> 5689.34
what's that specific moment it's like

5685.9 --> 5689.339999999999
halfway May

5691.06 --> 5695.02
anyway it's in May wave Gothic to happen

5693.34 --> 5697.719
but

5695.02 --> 5699.46
yeah craft work seen it

5697.719 --> 5702.82
a lot of others of course I mean

5699.46 --> 5704.44
hundreds of local band locations

5702.82 --> 5707.0199999999995
playing all day long there's so much

5704.44 --> 5709.36
it's you can never watch it all

5707.02 --> 5713.820000000001
that would take like a month

5709.36 --> 5713.82
but it all takes place in like four days

5715.78 --> 5721.8
so you got to pick your favorites

5718.719 --> 5721.8
and your styles

5725.08 --> 5729.46
I haven't been there by the way since I

5727.12 --> 5731.679
broke up with my ex

5729.46 --> 5734.46
so

5731.679 --> 5734.46
a decade

5739.54 --> 5745.06
but I think it's still going

5742.48 --> 5747.04
I mean it only grew in popularity over

5745.06 --> 5749.139
time

5747.04 --> 5751.54
it's almost like

5749.139 --> 5754.179
wow everywhere else kind of the gothic

5751.54 --> 5757.42
scene died down a bit

5754.179 --> 5759.179
more like little little clubs

5757.42 --> 5762.1
with just people that really like it

5759.179 --> 5764.38
getting older on average

5762.1 --> 5766.719
but like grave Gothic to happen like

5764.38 --> 5769.06
everything like everybody goes there

5766.719 --> 5771.04
from all over Europe and even from the

5769.06 --> 5773.320000000001
United States

5771.04 --> 5775.78
I've met people there from the United

5773.32 --> 5777.4
States from Mexico

5775.78 --> 5780.54
like

5777.4 --> 5780.54
all over the place

5789.179 --> 5793.84
yeah

5790.84 --> 5793.84
right

5796.6 --> 5801.120000000001
versus Comcast never heard of that

5824.32 --> 5827.94
right but hey I mean

5827.98 --> 5834.5199999999995
you guys do realize how I am not all

5831.58 --> 5836.82
that great in names right well that

5834.52 --> 5840.280000000001
include band names because there's

5836.82 --> 5842.32
thousands of bands like in every like

5840.28 --> 5843.699
even in the gothic scene like electronic

5842.32 --> 5846.34
or

5843.699 --> 5848.86
the industrial

5846.34 --> 5852.58
or even folk right there's all kinds of

5848.86 --> 5856.96
music and Associated from Folk

5852.58 --> 5860.92
to Gothic Rock to metal

5856.96 --> 5864.159
to electronic to Industrial to just 80

5860.92 --> 5867.34
style retro this dude there was so many

5864.159 --> 5869.5599999999995
different types of Gothic oh all kind of

5867.34 --> 5872.4400000000005
like together

5869.56 --> 5875.26
don't ask me the freaking band names I'm

5872.44 --> 5876.699
I'm already feel like wow I actually I

5875.26 --> 5878.62
wasn't acting like that but it's like

5876.699 --> 5882.28
yeah I actually know craft work I

5878.62 --> 5885.88
recognize the name it's like I actually

5882.28 --> 5889.12
know a name wow because I'm not really

5885.88 --> 5892.12
good at remembering names

5889.12 --> 5897.54
I'm actually I got a better memory for

5892.12 --> 5897.54
tunes for sound than for names

5897.639 --> 5901.3
so I'll recognize like hey I've heard

5899.56 --> 5904.54
this

5901.3 --> 5906.96
much easier than to actually know what

5904.54 --> 5906.96
it's called

5921.219 --> 5925.62
it is industrial electron

5936.88 --> 5939.4800000000005
right

5942.52 --> 5948.639
right and even like with with Gothic

5945.219 --> 5950.5
toughen there was also kind of like

5948.639 --> 5954.28
more Punk

5950.5 --> 5958.36
style like Gothic Punk and

5954.28 --> 5961.179
with punk rock issues dude it was just

5958.36 --> 5962.799999999999
so many different things that do kind of

5961.179 --> 5965.4
fit together like

5962.8 --> 5965.400000000001
they do

5966.94 --> 5972.28
even though one may look like a sort of

5969.159 --> 5974.92
weird cyber demon figure

5972.28 --> 5977.5599999999995
and there were [ __ ] and all that too

5974.92 --> 5981.159
while the others like no it's completely

5977.56 --> 5985.02
like a really more like me looking just

5981.159 --> 5985.0199999999995
very basic looking black

5985.179 --> 5989.139
and then there's somebody that looks

5986.92 --> 5990.88
like a Punker

5989.139 --> 5992.92
and there's people that were literally

5990.88 --> 5994.36
like larpers too

5992.92 --> 5996.6990000000005
that would like

5994.36 --> 5999.639
just

5996.699 --> 6001.739
like typical Festival style Renaissance

5999.639 --> 6005.46
Fair style people they were those were

6001.739 --> 6008.239
there too it was just air but dude that

6005.46 --> 6009.9800000000005
Festival is so freaking huge it's

6008.239 --> 6014.218999999999
massive

6009.98 --> 6016.5599999999995
massive crazy large

6014.219 --> 6018.84
like bigger

6016.56 --> 6020.400000000001
than the festivals we tend to have here

6018.84 --> 6022.860000000001
in the Netherlands and those are pretty

6020.4 --> 6025.0199999999995
big but those are usually like really

6022.86 --> 6028.0199999999995
everybody's almost packed on on top of

6025.02 --> 6030.42
one another on the festival grounds the

6028.02 --> 6033.360000000001
way the gothic toughen it's just so many

6030.42 --> 6035.28
locations so big the entire city is

6033.36 --> 6037.86
basically

6035.28 --> 6041.34
the festival ground literally the entire

6037.86 --> 6044.9
city in Leipzig is a pretty big city

6041.34 --> 6048.659000000001
oh and that one Festival is literally

6044.9 --> 6052.259999999999
like three quarters of the entire City's

6048.659 --> 6056.339999999999
gross income happens in those four days

6052.26 --> 6060.38
literally the entire City's gross income

6056.34 --> 6060.38
yeah 75 percent

6061.26 --> 6064.04
that's a lot

6071.219 --> 6079.219
good place to find a new girlfriend

6074.46 --> 6079.219
I wouldn't want to like go there alone

6080.219 --> 6085.62
but to be fair

6082.739 --> 6090.199
when I first met my girlfriend

6085.62 --> 6090.199
we literally went to that like

6090.48 --> 6093.32
when was it

6095.46 --> 6098.36
met her

6098.52 --> 6105.179
yeah like two months after we met and

6102.239 --> 6106.619
like started dating we went to that so

6105.179 --> 6109.08
yeah I

6106.619 --> 6111.48
we kind of did that

6109.08 --> 6114.44
every year from that point on which was

6111.48 --> 6116.94
really great because also well

6114.44 --> 6119.58
she'd be a little bit more wealthy and

6116.94 --> 6121.379999999999
get a hotel because otherwise you have
