349.88 --> 353.88
but still got a show to

354.28 --> 360.4
do so

356.24 --> 363.639
yeah open Benjamin stream yesterday

360.4 --> 366.52
was awesome the bonus stream he had very

363.639 --> 369.68
fascinating I went completely ballistic

366.52 --> 372.68
from inspiration on that in the

369.68 --> 372.68
chat

372.88 --> 381.44
ah but he had this

376.96 --> 381.44
uh this guy on sort of like

382.039 --> 387.52
a I don't even know what what he called

384.639 --> 390.0
himself like it seems like it was kind

387.52 --> 392.71999999999997
of like psychologist

390.0 --> 394.08
but like completely doing it his own way

392.72 --> 397.639
doing his own

394.08 --> 398.919
study and he was like really about

397.639 --> 402.84000000000003
demonic

398.919 --> 405.52
possession that model it was all very

402.84 --> 407.75899999999996
fascinating I had a lot to talk about

405.52 --> 411.71999999999997
somebody even there contacted

407.759 --> 414.16
me in in Rumble

411.72 --> 417.72
chat because I was talking about the

414.16 --> 417.72
technique because I thought

417.96 --> 423.039
that that guy was talking about the

421.199 --> 425.039
method he did he just called it the

423.039 --> 426.52
method and he didn't explain details and

425.039 --> 430.639
I was thinking like is that the

426.52 --> 432.24
technique that I use so I talked a

430.639 --> 434.28000000000003
little bit about it and that person was

432.24 --> 436.28000000000003
really interested in the chat so they

434.28 --> 440.75899999999996
contacted me on Skype and I basically

436.28 --> 440.75899999999996
gave him a full full roll

444.319 --> 448.96000000000004
out so that was

446.52 --> 451.31899999999996
interesting right hello dupons good to

video which was

534.839 --> 540.9200000000001
annoying and I made a comment on it and

538.44 --> 543.24

by it at

770.8 --> 776.12
first I don't know why that is all the

774.279 --> 777.8389999999999
extra light and all that is very

776.12 --> 780.839
enjoyable

1009.88 --> 1014.04

1026.88 --> 1033.16
hungry but I'm going to have lunch after

1029.559 --> 1033.16

1047.4 --> 1054.0
right

1048.919 --> 1057.6000000000001
right so yeah there have been for the

1054.0 --> 1059.799
record more gifts and go donations one

1057.6 --> 1064.1999999999998
more from

1059.799 --> 1066.48
somebody oh wait no I got four

1064.2 --> 1070.4
now

1066.48 --> 1070.4
yeah who was the other

1076.24 --> 1084.559
person JC level

1079.72 --> 1088.1200000000001
really okay that's just nuts jamc level

1084.559 --> 1090.84
wants me back on Flat Earth debates that

1088.12 --> 1093.9599999999998
is so typical what he wants to make more

1090.84 --> 1097.24
ridiculous videos about how am I

1093.96 --> 1100.24
Nathan's dog I'm sure he wants me

1097.24 --> 1104.36
back I can parasite of it

1100.24 --> 1106.88
more but thanks

1104.36 --> 1113.0
though in this rate it's only going to

1106.88 --> 1113.0
take roughly until April till I get

1117.64 --> 1122.5590000000002
back but yeah keep it up I mean I miss

1120.72 --> 1125.039
the guys at

1122.559 --> 1127.1589999999999
fed I miss him

1125.039 --> 1131.2
too a

1127.159 --> 1136.24
bit on the other hand I really like the

1131.2 --> 1136.24
peace and calm I'm really liking

1136.72 --> 1142.76
it it feels so much

1139.679 --> 1145.1200000000001
healthier and it makes hunger moments

1142.76 --> 1145.12
less

1152.24 --> 1157.84
painful because bickering and hunger are

1155.679 --> 1160.8400000000001
not a good

1157.84 --> 1160.84
combination

1164.4 --> 1170.24
right hey Rich G good to see you

1184.08 --> 1188.96
right places that give out free

1187.12 --> 1193.1999999999998
meals

1188.96 --> 1197.24
uh I think so sort

1193.2 --> 1200.24
of not really though I I don't

1197.24 --> 1200.24
know

1209.84 --> 1212.76
it's not going to be

1214.559 --> 1221.559
great and it's most likely not going to

1217.799 --> 1224.32
be organic because I have an exclusive

1221.559 --> 1226.08
organic diet and that's going to stay

1224.32 --> 1229.72
until I

1226.08 --> 1231.8799999999999
die because it I've already tested this

1229.72 --> 1234.4
in the past plenty of times it's better

1231.88 --> 1237.1200000000001
for me to just not eat at

1234.4 --> 1240.799
all than to go for

1237.12 --> 1243.34
like cheap ass non-organic

1240.799 --> 1244.44
food like it destroys

1243.34 --> 1247.3999999999999
[Music]

1244.44 --> 1250.919
me it just

1247.4 --> 1254.0800000000002
does RS every balance the entire balance

1250.919 --> 1257.1200000000001
I have my yeah just that I'm stable that

1254.08 --> 1259.799
all goes away very

1257.12 --> 1263.1589999999999
quickly

1259.799 --> 1263.1589999999999
like churches yeah

1274.64 --> 1280.76
right no all I need is just just a

1278.76 --> 1282.72
little bit of support here and there and

1280.76 --> 1285.2
I can make it I mean that's what's been

1282.72 --> 1285.2
happening

1285.76 --> 1291.039
now like the last month and

1289.159 --> 1293.6000000000001
it it has

1291.039 --> 1297.679
worked I still built up the debt though

1293.6 --> 1297.6789999999999
but that's what the gifts and go is

1300.12 --> 1304.559
for right

1302.32 --> 1307.12
technically it's kind of important that

1304.559 --> 1308.799
that things get gets filled up because

1307.12 --> 1312.279
otherwise like

1308.799 --> 1314.96
yeah I mean it says what it says right I

1312.279 --> 1317.76
mean if you build up growing de like

1314.96 --> 1321.96
that it will eventually lead to getting

1317.76 --> 1326.32
EV icted it always [ __ ]

1321.96 --> 1328.4
does or like it's going to be crazy like

1326.32 --> 1329.8799999999999
people trying to trick you to get out of

1328.4 --> 1332.24
your house so they lock you out or

1329.88 --> 1335.6000000000001
something like that [ __ ] yeah [ __ ] you

1332.24 --> 1338.0
yeah I'm not going to [ __ ] do

1335.6 --> 1340.9599999999998
that

1338.0 --> 1343.72
so yeah that's not going to be part of

1340.96 --> 1347.0
this show I never like this is not oh

1343.72 --> 1349.279
look at my life collapsing oh for you to

1347.0 --> 1351.0
enjoy like a bunch your Rich ass demon

1349.279 --> 1354.24
seeing how you're destroying the [ __ ]

1351.0 --> 1356.76
world yeah now that's not this show you

1354.24 --> 1358.44
got it that's not what this is that's

1356.76 --> 1360.84
not why I do this if that's going to

1358.44 --> 1361.679
happen then [ __ ] this show and [ __ ] all

1360.84 --> 1364.9599999999998
of

1361.679 --> 1370.5590000000002
you this show is for other

1364.96 --> 1373.0
stuff show is for Learning and sharing

1370.559 --> 1376.24
information and a bit of entertainment

1373.0 --> 1379.96
here and there that's what it's for and

1376.24 --> 1382.919
a answering questions that you have it's

1379.96 --> 1385.72
not for oh look at this guy's life

1382.919 --> 1388.159
completely crumbling yeah that's not

1385.72 --> 1388.159
what it's

1396.42 --> 1399.569
[Music]

1404.52 --> 1409.8799999999999
[Music]

1406.88 --> 1409.88
for

1410.799 --> 1416.4
so if nobody's interested if the only

1414.039 --> 1419.12
thing you're doing is just oh I'm poor

1416.4 --> 1423.0
I'm going to hang around this guy and

1419.12 --> 1423.0
that's it well then I'm

1433.2 --> 1440.159
out then it's better to just not use my

1437.0 --> 1444.279
intellect or words or anything at

1440.159 --> 1447.48
all and just do some [ __ ] [ __ ] job

1444.279 --> 1449.48
like a drone making more money having

1447.48 --> 1452.559
probably less bickering although it will

1449.48 --> 1459.559
find me I'm sure it

1452.559 --> 1461.799
will and not continually have to worry

1459.559 --> 1465.399
about

1461.799 --> 1468.72
destitution because it sucks Beyond

1465.399 --> 1472.0
imagination the only reason

1468.72 --> 1474.24
why even held on is just because all

1472.0 --> 1476.76
this information like about Flat Earth

1474.24 --> 1479.919
and everything and my ideas about it and

1476.76 --> 1484.64
rolling it out and pointing things out

1479.919 --> 1484.64
was worth it like it's worth it to

1485.0 --> 1494.12
me but only if that means I stay

1489.72 --> 1494.1200000000001
financially stable that's the

1496.76 --> 1499.76
condition

1513.559 --> 1516.6399999999999
what Stevie went

1525.679 --> 1531.8400000000001
no yelling at you is yeah well this

1528.52 --> 1531.84
isn't for you

1536.44 --> 1541.72
[ __ ] I don't give a [ __ ] about how

1539.399 --> 1546.1589999999999
many of you [ __ ] retards out there

1541.72 --> 1548.799
are offended go [ __ ] yourself then don't

1546.159 --> 1551.159
watch this show then [ __ ] you

1548.799 --> 1552.399
generally go around in your life hang

1551.159 --> 1555.679
around

1552.399 --> 1559.6789999999999
places that you find antagonizing what

1555.679 --> 1559.679
kind of a [ __ ] [ __ ] are you

1560.159 --> 1564.7990000000002
idiot go and do something productive

1562.96 --> 1569.48
with your life

1564.799 --> 1573.679
huh like things that actually you find

1569.48 --> 1578.32
interesting or fun or Pleasant

1573.679 --> 1583.0
maybe I'm talking to the troll Stevie

1578.32 --> 1583.0
win I always have to do that

1586.6 --> 1589.6
[ __ ]

1600.36 --> 1604.9189999999999
all right have questions get

1605.6 --> 1610.32
answers did not like your question no I

1608.0 --> 1612.399
don't like that's just dumb puzzle

1610.32 --> 1616.039
questions I don't give a [ __ ] I'm not

1612.399 --> 1616.039
here to play mind

1616.6 --> 1623.84
games

1618.96 --> 1623.8400000000001
I'm not here to solve pointless

1625.039 --> 1632.12
puzzles I want real

1628.2 --> 1634.52
stuff real complications real issues

1632.12 --> 1636.84
real dilemas that you can find a way

1634.52 --> 1639.76
through in yeah and then I go and find a

1636.84 --> 1643.9599999999998
way through that's what I want that's

1639.76 --> 1646.12
what I can nobody ever does it though

1643.96 --> 1648.2
and when they do it immediately works

1646.12 --> 1650.1999999999998
and they're like oh Mr and then

1648.2 --> 1652.44
everybody forgets about it for [ __ ]

1650.2 --> 1654.96
years and years and years and nobody

1652.44 --> 1659.44
ever asks

1654.96 --> 1659.44
anything or to distracted or

1659.919 --> 1665.88
something kept saying like yeah I'm I'm

1663.279 --> 1668.559
the Oracle I'm an oracle here I can do

1665.88 --> 1672.3600000000001
things nobody gives a

1668.559 --> 1674.6
[ __ ] I'll just let it waste away all the

1672.36 --> 1676.1589999999999
opportunities every day you could come

1674.6 --> 1678.7199999999998
here and ask a

1676.159 --> 1680.64
question a a a question that has a

1678.72 --> 1685.48
[ __ ] point and isn't just some stupid

1680.64 --> 1685.48
mind game every day you could do

1686.799 --> 1693.6
that I'm not talking to you specifically

1690.96 --> 1693.6000000000001
Stevie

1703.36 --> 1708.799
win but yeah maybe you do have a

1706.679 --> 1711.76
question I can help you with tell me

1708.799 --> 1711.76
then

1721.44 --> 1725.3600000000001
go what arcade

1725.48 --> 1731.48
games no anything you're going to pick

1729.12 --> 1733.799
it's going to bore me to death cuz if

1731.48 --> 1736.44
you're stuck on an island none of that

1733.799 --> 1738.44
[ __ ] matters anything the only thing

1736.44 --> 1741.6000000000001
that matters is if you're going to be

1738.44 --> 1743.96
able to survive on that food throughout

1741.6 --> 1747.9189999999999
depression that can't

1743.96 --> 1750.0
end like book V arcade

1747.919 --> 1752.0
game what are you going to run the

1750.0 --> 1753.36
arcade game on does it come with its own

1752.0 --> 1757.159
power

1753.36 --> 1761.399
supply and the book that's

1757.159 --> 1763.88
cute I don't really like reading at all

1761.399 --> 1766.12
although that fun i' probably take the

1763.88 --> 1768.44
book of rud Steiner because I that would

1766.12 --> 1771.36
like take me

1768.44 --> 1773.72
like years and years to get through it

1771.36 --> 1778.1589999999999
cuz every time I read something I get

1773.72 --> 1778.159
completely distracted after just one

1778.279 --> 1784.44
page every [ __ ] time no exceptions

1782.08 --> 1786.76
it's it's I always been an issue so I'm

1784.44 --> 1789.3200000000002
not really a book reader I like video

1786.76 --> 1791.919
games but I mean if you're stuck like

1789.32 --> 1793.8799999999999
that then a video game sucks and besides

1791.919 --> 1796.159
where are you going to get the power and

1793.88 --> 1798.72
with food yeah I could get the food I

1796.159 --> 1801.7990000000002
like but but if you're going to be stuck

1798.72 --> 1804.3600000000001
on a freaking Island potentially forever

1801.799 --> 1806.32
you need the just something that you can

1804.36 --> 1811.039
survive with you don't have to like it

1806.32 --> 1811.039
I'm sorry now I'm answering your

1824.08 --> 1831.0
question if a is gas how would some one

1827.6 --> 1835.039
lying on the floor be able to breathe if

1831.0 --> 1838.0
gas does not go down uh it goes in all

1835.039 --> 1840.8799999999999
directions and hey it goes to where the

1838.0 --> 1842.84
lower pressure is Right high pressure

1840.88 --> 1846.0390000000002
goes to low pressure and guess what

1842.84 --> 1848.6
happens when you're when you breathe in

1846.039 --> 1852.72
yeah there's a lower pressure Zone

1848.6 --> 1856.84
that's being created by your ribs

1852.72 --> 1859.76
pulling pulling more room into your

1856.84 --> 1862.9599999999998
chest where your lungs like a balloon

1859.76 --> 1866.72
then draw a lower pressure

1862.96 --> 1870.8400000000001
vacuum that forces the air everywhere

1866.72 --> 1873.48
surrounding it to push inside of the

1870.84 --> 1876.32
lower pressure

1873.48 --> 1878.3990000000001
volume and that's why it goes there it's

1876.32 --> 1881.96
not go in there because it goes down

1878.399 --> 1885.6789999999999
goes boom boom yeah air doesn't just

1881.96 --> 1888.679
fall into your into your you open your

1885.679 --> 1890.96
lungs it falls in no no no you have to

1888.679 --> 1893.679
suck it in you have to create the lower

1890.96 --> 1897.1200000000001
pressure and then the gas that presses

1893.679 --> 1899.279
in all directions will suddenly have

1897.12 --> 1901.639
room to maneuver towards the low

1899.279 --> 1904.96
pressure Zone from all

1901.639 --> 1909.08
directions yeah that's what

1904.96 --> 1909.08
happens not go down go boom

1909.36 --> 1914.84
boom why would the gas near your your

1912.36 --> 1914.84
nose

1915.0 --> 1920.32
near because it's going in all Direction

1917.919 --> 1924.72
it doesn't go down it goes in all

1920.32 --> 1924.72
directions Stevie wi not

1926.679 --> 1934.8400000000001
down if it goes in all directions well

1930.44 --> 1934.8400000000001
then that means it's going to be

1934.88 --> 1941.0800000000002
everywhere not just down CO2 pulls on

1938.88 --> 1944.48
the floor that's

1941.08 --> 1948.76
cute and if you can see

1944.48 --> 1951.0
it then it's not in its gasas State then

1948.76 --> 1955.639
you're in in its liquid state see you're

1951.0 --> 1955.639
two yeah you can make a pool of that

1956.279 --> 1961.919
sure right and even in its gaseous State

1959.559 --> 1965.44
temporarily it might take

1961.919 --> 1968.3990000000001
up a bit of volume separated from the

1965.44 --> 1970.96
rest of the air and then it will sit

1968.399 --> 1973.2399999999998
lower to the ground because its average

1970.96 --> 1975.8400000000001
density in a concentrated in a

1973.24 --> 1978.559
concentrated state is more

1975.84 --> 1981.8799999999999
dense than the

1978.559 --> 1983.639
air the rest of the air but that's not

1981.88 --> 1985.3990000000001
going to last long because well gas is

1983.639 --> 1989.039
mov in all directions and it's going to

1985.399 --> 1992.08
be pushing against the regular gas as is

1989.039 --> 1996.279
the regular gas pushing against that CO2

1992.08 --> 1998.32
separated pure layer and thus it

1996.279 --> 2003.08
dissipates it

1998.32 --> 2007.4399999999998
dissolves and then yeah there is no more

2003.08 --> 2010.08
layer doesn't take too long even right

2007.44 --> 2013.8400000000001
it would require a Non-Stop continual

2010.08 --> 2016.559
influx of pure CO2 gas into a place like

2013.84 --> 2019.0
that to have a what seems like a

2016.559 --> 2022.12
persistent layer but in the meantime all

2019.0 --> 2024.799
of that Co will be continually gradually

2022.12 --> 2028.0
dissipating into the

2024.799 --> 2030.08
air so it's not actually sitting there

2028.0 --> 2034.08
it's just concentrated there and the

2030.08 --> 2037.279
concentrated bit is going to sit lower

2034.08 --> 2040.24
because it's more dense as a gas than

2037.279 --> 2041.24
the rest of the gas yeah if you did that

2040.24 --> 2044.639
with

2041.24 --> 2046.559
helium well it would probably if you

2044.639 --> 2049.1189999999997
like vented a bunch of helium out of a

2046.559 --> 2052.639
tank in a closed room then at first it

2049.119 --> 2055.8
would probably gather at the

2052.639 --> 2059.76
ceiling before it all dissolves into the

2055.8 --> 2061.5600000000004
air because helium is less dense on

2059.76 --> 2066.5600000000004
average than the

2061.56 --> 2070.44
air yeah so it goes up because it's less

2066.56 --> 2074.0789999999997
dense or it goes down because it's more

2070.44 --> 2077.7200000000003
dense but it doesn't all just go

2074.079 --> 2080.5600000000004
down gas does not go down go boom boom

2077.72 --> 2083.6789999999996
it goes in all directions and hey if a

2080.56 --> 2084.879
bit of air is more dense than another

2083.679 --> 2089.119
bit of

2084.879 --> 2091.159
air it will have a tendency to displace

2089.119 --> 2094.48
itself downward

2091.159 --> 2097.6400000000003
until it has been dissolved in equalized

2094.48 --> 2099.2
in density and then like the rest of

2097.64 --> 2102.68
that air it would just go in all

2099.2 --> 2108.359
directions at all times like air

2102.68 --> 2110.56
does so that should solve the

2108.359 --> 2111.48
question it's a well-known phenomen it's

2110.56 --> 2114.2799999999997
not

2111.48 --> 2115.4
incorrect helium Falls in a vac you're

2114.28 --> 2118.88
[ __ ]

2115.4 --> 2123.119
insane no no helium does not fall in a

2118.88 --> 2125.6400000000003
vacuum no because you can't isolate

2123.119 --> 2127.92
helium you have to put it in something

2125.64 --> 2129.52
else that's something else is going to

2127.92 --> 2132.6800000000003
have a

2129.52 --> 2135.52
density it's going to be solid it's

2132.68 --> 2139.2799999999997
going to have a density and it is going

2135.52 --> 2142.079
to go down not the helium it's going to

2139.28 --> 2145.32
just pull the helium

2142.079 --> 2148.2400000000002
down that's what's going to

2145.32 --> 2150.079
happen right because the average density

2148.24 --> 2153.0789999999997
of the helium

2150.079 --> 2155.52
stuck in that balloon

2153.079 --> 2158.48
thing well it has a density it actually

2155.52 --> 2160.48
has a weight because why the balloon the

2158.48 --> 2162.72
rubber has weight the thing whatever

2160.48 --> 2164.4
it's stuck in it has weight it's going

2162.72 --> 2167.52
to go

2164.4 --> 2169.56
down unless it's like in liquid that's

2167.52 --> 2170.96
even more dense and then it might float

2169.56 --> 2173.4
up

2170.96 --> 2175.839
right but in a vacuum yeah that's going

2173.4 --> 2178.319
to go down because the balloon is going

2175.839 --> 2178.319
to go

2181.04 --> 2188.2
down so does the helium yeah well that's

2184.359 --> 2190.24
because the balloon is going down

2188.2 --> 2191.9199999999996
the balloon is pulling the helium down

2190.24 --> 2194.8799999999997
the helium just wants to go in all

2191.92 --> 2197.64
directions it doesn't give a [ __ ] you

2194.88 --> 2202.839
see you don't have the balloon there to

2197.64 --> 2204.96
to keep it in one place keep it at that

2202.839 --> 2206.7599999999998
lower density as it is when it is

2204.96 --> 2209.2
concentrated it's going to go in all

2206.76 --> 2211.2400000000002
directions yeah the balloon is the thing

2209.2 --> 2214.8799999999997
that's going down in the vacuum chamber

2211.24 --> 2219.16
not the helium the balloon you can

2214.88 --> 2221.0
demonstrate it without the balloon dip

2219.16 --> 2224.44
[ __ ]

2221.0 --> 2228.2
huh you didn't think of that

2224.44 --> 2232.0
dumbass yeah you can't cuz the balloon

2228.2 --> 2232.0
is going down not the gas in

2238.04 --> 2242.68
it what if you injected helium in the

2240.88 --> 2244.76
vacuum without a balloon yeah well then

2242.68 --> 2248.04
it explodes in all Direction instantly

2244.76 --> 2250.5600000000004
and it's everywhere feeling up to space

2248.04 --> 2252.44
unless the vacuum keeps getting

2250.56 --> 2255.359
reinforced with a suction machine and

2252.44 --> 2259.319
then that will all be gone very quickly

2255.359 --> 2261.5989999999997
it falls you're insane yeah helium

2259.319 --> 2264.4
doesn't f form puddles you're out of

2261.599 --> 2264.4
your mind

2266.52 --> 2270.96
dude temperature ski yeah I'm sure it

2271.64 --> 2278.68
is yeah yeah and hey [ __ ] whining in

2276.0 --> 2281.52
my chat about how I talk it doesn't help

2278.68 --> 2284.64
you either it just means I immediately

2281.52 --> 2288.4
ban you yeah

2284.64 --> 2291.2799999999997
[ __ ] I just Bann you immediately so

2288.4 --> 2294.1600000000003
shut the [ __ ] up you can't handle the

2291.28 --> 2296.3190000000004
way I talk and just shut the [ __ ] up

2294.16 --> 2298.1189999999997
write it down on a piece of paper and

2296.319 --> 2301.079
and give it a god whatever you want to

2298.119 --> 2303.92
do but don't whine about it in my chat I

2301.079 --> 2306.04
do the show the way I do my answers are

2303.92 --> 2308.76
correct my explanations are correct I

2306.04 --> 2310.16
get imp I will use swear words and

2308.76 --> 2311.599
there's nothing you're going to do about

2310.16 --> 2315.24
it because if you're going to whine

2311.599 --> 2317.4
about it in my chat you get banned you

2315.24 --> 2317.3999999999996
got

2318.319 --> 2321.839
it I hope you

2327.839 --> 2333.68
do or you could make fun of it and then

2330.16 --> 2333.68
I kick you too bye

2335.16 --> 2341.359
Mike shove you're comedy up your ass huh

2338.88 --> 2343.359
[ __ ] I'm correct I'm correct about

2341.359 --> 2346.64
everything I said

2343.359 --> 2350.04
here gas doesn't go down go boom boom

2346.64 --> 2352.2799999999997
the helium balloon goes down because the

2350.04 --> 2354.599
balloon goes down the helium doesn't go

2352.28 --> 2356.8390000000004
down without the balloon it goes in all

2354.599 --> 2360.079
directions not

2356.839 --> 2362.319
down yeah helium low pressure doesn't

2360.079 --> 2365.4
stay concentrated for a bit it falls

2362.319 --> 2368.56
down like a droplet yeah no it doesn't

2365.4 --> 2372.04
it just boom and directions immediately

2368.56 --> 2376.04
that's what helium does in a vacuum or

2372.04 --> 2380.96
any gas without the balloon forcing it

2376.04 --> 2380.96
to stay consistently concentrated in one

2388.64 --> 2395.4
place does good now it does not go down

2391.52 --> 2398.4
go boom boom it goes in all

2395.4 --> 2398.4
directions

2400.0 --> 2402.839
that's what gas

2403.319 --> 2410.44
does right relative

2406.319 --> 2414.4
density May create

2410.44 --> 2417.96
temporary displacements in either up or

2414.4 --> 2419.88
down right because of the concentration

2417.96 --> 2421.96
which is not a natural state right

2419.88 --> 2424.04
entropy will set in it's not going to

2421.96 --> 2428.359
stay like

2424.04 --> 2428.359
that so

2428.52 --> 2434.64
gas don't go down go boom boom like when

2431.839 --> 2439.359
you unleash entropy like you have a

2434.64 --> 2442.7599999999998
scenario it has to be forever yeah well

2439.359 --> 2445.92
there's no forever scenario in which gas

2442.76 --> 2448.2000000000003
is going to be a layer it does not exist

2445.92 --> 2451.04
and that is the entire point of the

2448.2 --> 2454.0
entire argument why we've been harping

2451.04 --> 2456.319
on gas doesn't go down go boom boom

2454.0 --> 2460.079
because heliocentrism in its Del

2456.319 --> 2462.24
illusion suggests that gas sits in a

2460.079 --> 2466.319
layer right next to a vacuum in a

2462.24 --> 2468.4399999999996
permanent State and that's

2466.319 --> 2472.319
absurd it

2468.44 --> 2475.64
doesn't whatever gas does with layers

2472.319 --> 2478.319
concern is always ever a temporary

2475.64 --> 2481.7599999999998
scenario that does not last very long at

2478.319 --> 2485.24
all yeah there is no permanent layering

2481.76 --> 2487.6800000000003
of gas that doesn't exist in nature like

2485.24 --> 2490.68
it doesn't matter what type of gases you

2487.68 --> 2494.2799999999997
throw in with one another they're never

2490.68 --> 2497.0
going to end up forming layers they

2494.28 --> 2499.28
might start out a little bit and then

2497.0 --> 2504.0
they mix in because that's what gases do

2499.28 --> 2505.88
they all do it and they never form

2504.0 --> 2509.68
separate

2505.88 --> 2509.6800000000003
layers they don't do

2514.119 --> 2523.6400000000003
that yeah CU ENT tropy mix it up it will

2518.4 --> 2523.64
become inhomogeneous mesh just like the

2527.92 --> 2532.28
air Stevie are you gon to just repeat

2530.839 --> 2535.24
that D that

2532.28 --> 2537.0400000000004
damn why are you repeating that [ __ ]

2535.24 --> 2539.2
didn't I already answer you exactly how

2537.04 --> 2539.2
that

2542.76 --> 2548.3590000000004
work you eventually would be able to

2546.52 --> 2552.119
what do you mean

2548.359 --> 2552.119
eventually what does that even

2568.92 --> 2575.2400000000002
mean now gas would never stay at the

2571.8 --> 2577.88
ground yeah a single gas molecule is

2575.24 --> 2579.64
never going to stay at the ground it's

2577.88 --> 2581.6800000000003
going to be moving all over the place

2579.64 --> 2584.04
it's not going to be in one place and

2581.68 --> 2584.04
stay

2586.24 --> 2592.2
there how is there air at the floor

2588.44 --> 2593.68
level well that air goes somewhere else

2592.2 --> 2596.7999999999997
and guess what the air that was

2593.68 --> 2599.44
somewhere else then goes there it keeps

2596.8 --> 2601.2000000000003
moving yeah the air here is right here

2599.44 --> 2602.7200000000003
and right now and then oh oh it's now

2601.2 --> 2605.0
over there and guess what the air that

2602.72 --> 2608.2799999999997
was over there is now there because it

2605.0 --> 2609.2
keeps moving all over the place that's

2608.28 --> 2612.079
what it

2609.2 --> 2615.839
does it doesn't stay

2612.079 --> 2616.8390000000004
somewhere it keeps moving everything the

2615.839 --> 2619.72
whole

2616.839 --> 2623.04
thing is moving ever

2619.72 --> 2623.04
moving within

2631.64 --> 2638.1189999999997
itself right the only way to keep any

2634.88 --> 2642.04
type of gas in in one place that same

2638.119 --> 2645.28
gas in one place is by closing it off

2642.04 --> 2647.599
with a container and then that gas in

2645.28 --> 2649.6400000000003
that container is going to stay there

2647.599 --> 2653.04
within the container and only move

2649.64 --> 2655.2799999999997
around within that available space But

2653.04 --> 2656.88
even the gas within it is going to be

2655.28 --> 2659.28
one part of that gas is going to be on

2656.88 --> 2660.599
one side and then guess what a few

2659.28 --> 2662.2400000000002
minutes after it's going to be on the

2660.599 --> 2664.1600000000003
other side and then a few minutes after

2662.24 --> 2667.24
it's going to be on the other side again

2664.16 --> 2670.2799999999997
because gas keeps moving around in the

2667.24 --> 2674.16
available volume it is

2670.28 --> 2674.1600000000003
in it just does

2694.96 --> 2699.599
that

2697.4 --> 2703.64
why is there more air at the floor and

2699.599 --> 2707.52
less at the ceiling you mean in the

2703.64 --> 2710.1189999999997
realm well there's other influences of

2707.52 --> 2713.68
course temperature influences yeah

2710.119 --> 2716.6800000000003
there's more heat at the ground and

2713.68 --> 2719.16
there's matter there that also creates

2716.68 --> 2721.839
gas partially thanks to heat and

2719.16 --> 2725.5989999999997
chemical reactions and all that and up

2721.839 --> 2726.68
there it's pretty damn cold yeah so

2725.599 --> 2730.2000000000003
that's

2726.68 --> 2732.16
why there is more air that gill still

2730.2 --> 2734.2799999999997
keeps moving around but as it's moving

2732.16 --> 2736.96
around it will be more of it at the

2734.28 --> 2739.76
floor than at the

2736.96 --> 2742.2400000000002
ceiling it will still keep be moving

2739.76 --> 2744.96
around between all of it all the time it

2742.24 --> 2747.1189999999997
will just concentrate more at the floor

2744.96 --> 2750.7200000000003
as at the ceiling because there's more

2747.119 --> 2750.7200000000003
heat at the

2751.48 --> 2758.16
floor hey shat Bon good to see

2754.88 --> 2760.28
you what at the ceiling hot air what are

2758.16 --> 2762.7999999999997
you talking about yeah that yeah now

2760.28 --> 2766.3190000000004
that's what the air does that's what the

2762.8 --> 2768.559
heated air does yes what what it mostly

2766.319 --> 2771.079
does is pressure in all directions and

2768.559 --> 2772.96
that causes more gas pressure to be

2771.079 --> 2776.7200000000003
there higher

2772.96 --> 2780.52
pressure yeah it's what it

2776.72 --> 2782.72
is that's the only reason that can even

2780.52 --> 2785.2
be figured out why the

2782.72 --> 2786.839
gradient is temperature influence and it

2785.2 --> 2789.8799999999997
can be demon

2786.839 --> 2792.2799999999997
right you have a closed

2789.88 --> 2794.48
container uh like an aquarium or

2792.28 --> 2798.7200000000003
something with gas in

2794.48 --> 2801.079
it and then you introduce two

2798.72 --> 2803.3999999999996
temperature altering elements you put a

2801.079 --> 2805.559
heating element on one side of it and

2803.4 --> 2809.079
then a cold element on the other

2805.559 --> 2812.76
side a gas pressure gradient will start

2809.079 --> 2814.76
to form within that container with a

2812.76 --> 2816.6400000000003
higher pressure right next to the

2814.76 --> 2818.28
heating element

2816.64 --> 2820.72
all within the closed container right

2818.28 --> 2823.76
it's just radiating from the outside

2820.72 --> 2826.68
Inward and at lower pressure at the coal

2823.76 --> 2826.6800000000003
element that's just what

2829.4 --> 2834.88
happens there cannot be yeah there isn't

2831.96 --> 2838.0
a layer it's not a layer of separated

2834.88 --> 2841.119
gas it's just there's more pressure

2838.0 --> 2843.839
there the gas that keeps moving every

2841.119 --> 2846.2000000000003
mean how many times dude it keeps moving

2843.839 --> 2849.68
all over the place but when it happens

2846.2 --> 2853.0789999999997
to be at the hot side it gets more

2849.68 --> 2855.68
pressurized when it's there and when

2853.079 --> 2859.28
it's at the cold side it gets less

2855.68 --> 2860.3999999999996
pressurized that's what happens it isn't

2859.28 --> 2865.52
a

2860.4 --> 2868.96
layer the gradient technically isn't gas

2865.52 --> 2872.2
layering it's just different pressure

2868.96 --> 2872.2
influences through the

2872.52 --> 2879.48
temperature a gradual change yeah again

2875.839 --> 2882.24
yes yes but layer definitely isn't the

2879.48 --> 2883.96
right word for it layer is really a

2882.24 --> 2886.4799999999996
heliocentric

2883.96 --> 2888.7200000000003
suggestion based on the idea that gas

2886.48 --> 2891.96
goes down go boom boom like a

2888.72 --> 2893.319
fluid like a liquid just kind of like oh

2891.96 --> 2895.2400000000002
it's a fluid so we're just going to

2893.319 --> 2897.52
think of it as a liquid and then it can

2895.24 --> 2900.1189999999997
go down go boom boom in some Newtonian

2897.52 --> 2903.16
type model and then it should be able to

2900.119 --> 2906.44
layer like liquids yeah well it doesn't

2903.16 --> 2907.7599999999998
do that doesn't form layers

2906.44 --> 2911.44
can form a

2907.76 --> 2911.44
gradient but that's not

2911.76 --> 2917.92
layering yeah if you take a scoop of

2915.4 --> 2920.96
high pressure gas you put it in a tanker

2917.92 --> 2924.8
as is and you then release

2920.96 --> 2926.119
it at a very high altitude for example

2924.8 --> 2928.7200000000003
yeah guess what's going to happen it

2926.119 --> 2932.079
immediately it doesn't like well where's

2928.72 --> 2934.9199999999996
higher pressure gas quickly we're going

2932.079 --> 2936.44
to fall down we're going to fall down go

2934.92 --> 2939.079
boom boom to to where the higher

2936.44 --> 2942.319
pressure gas is because it's a no no it

2939.079 --> 2946.28
just poof it immediately adapts to the

2942.319 --> 2949.119
air that is right there spreads around

2946.28 --> 2952.599
and then attains the same pressure

2949.119 --> 2956.4
because of the general temperature

2952.599 --> 2958.799
influences like because gas also has a

2956.4 --> 2961.28
temperature and gives its temperature to

2958.799 --> 2964.839
other gas right so it's just immediately

2961.28 --> 2966.6800000000003
going to adapt to the temperature State

2964.839 --> 2969.44
at that height

2966.68 --> 2973.2
and everything and then become part of

2969.44 --> 2976.0
it it doesn't oh we're we're from the

2973.2 --> 2977.7599999999998
thicker layer of the Earth gas so we're

2976.0 --> 2980.799
going to fall down to where the thicker

2977.76 --> 2984.7990000000004
layer is no no that's not what gas

2980.799 --> 2984.799
does cuz it is in a

2985.64 --> 2991.68
layer no it does not definitely go down

2989.079 --> 2991.6800000000003
in One

2991.72 --> 2996.04
Direction

2994.52 --> 2998.319
no

2996.04 --> 3001.0
I can't believe you just said that after

2998.319 --> 3004.64
I explained twice how that isn't the

3001.0 --> 3004.64
case aren't you listening Stevie

3006.359 --> 3012.24
wi I just I just told you it's not going

3009.96 --> 3016.079
to do

3012.24 --> 3019.52
that because it isn't the layer of other

3016.079 --> 3022.079
type gas it it's not a liquid it doesn't

3019.52 --> 3022.079
act like

3024.119 --> 3029.2000000000003
that yeah but then just so don't say it

3027.2 --> 3032.319
goes down it goes in all directions

3029.2 --> 3036.04
there's no significance with

3032.319 --> 3039.7599999999998
down there is no persistent going that

3036.04 --> 3041.7599999999998
direction at all time it never does that

3039.76 --> 3044.3190000000004
it just goes in all directions so just

3041.76 --> 3048.2000000000003
say that it goes in all directions not

3044.319 --> 3048.2
also down it goes in all

3054.44 --> 3057.44
directions

3065.52 --> 3070.799
well from now yeah that it will

3067.839 --> 3073.96
help it will help your own

3070.799 --> 3073.96
misunderstanding with

3074.76 --> 3082.0400000000004
it but I mean yeah gases and the idea

3078.76 --> 3084.7990000000004
that gas has weight or mass it's all a

3082.04 --> 3086.48
giant cluster screw of misunderstandings

3084.799 --> 3089.96
and Mis

3086.48 --> 3092.76
information that starts in school and

3089.96 --> 3094.559
like I was barely able to figure it out

3092.76 --> 3096.6800000000003
with the teacher he tried to explain it

3094.559 --> 3099.2400000000002
to me then and like I could barely

3096.68 --> 3102.96
figure it out but I did get to know

3099.24 --> 3106.5989999999997
about density and that apparently

3102.96 --> 3109.52
gravity basically is pseudo science and

3106.599 --> 3113.44
that density that's what he said the

3109.52 --> 3117.48
density is the real scientifically

3113.44 --> 3119.4
valid thing it's the real thing that's

3117.48 --> 3121.76
what I learned like in school and I I

3119.4 --> 3125.7200000000003
could barely grasp it

3121.76 --> 3125.7200000000003
even but I did remember

3128.88 --> 3134.96
it gas Under Pressure goes in yeah but

3132.76 --> 3137.8390000000004
tell me about this gas not under

3134.96 --> 3142.68
pressure C

3137.839 --> 3147.04
Define non pressurized

3142.68 --> 3149.2799999999997
gas somebody find me defin of non

3147.04 --> 3152.0
pressurized gas that that would be

3149.28 --> 3155.7200000000003
interesting and

3152.0 --> 3159.96
paradoxical cuz what defines gas

3155.72 --> 3163.48
pressure the yeah like the gas what is

3159.96 --> 3168.04
defined sorry I'm messing up what

3163.48 --> 3168.04
defines the gas well that it

3168.68 --> 3177.24
presses SO gas that doesn't press that

3173.119 --> 3177.2400000000002
well that couldn't be gas then

3177.76 --> 3182.2400000000002
because that's how you know it's

3179.76 --> 3185.0400000000004
gas that it

3182.24 --> 3187.3999999999996
presses that it will desperately try to

3185.04 --> 3191.04
fill the available volume immediately

3187.4 --> 3191.04
with ma with a mighty

3191.92 --> 3198.92
Force it's like a vacuum being filled

3196.0 --> 3202.0
can like move

3198.92 --> 3203.6800000000003
everything right it's like we're just

3202.0 --> 3205.92
thinking like oh we're in the nothing

3203.68 --> 3208.24
we're just in air and it's all cool and

3205.92 --> 3210.839
with a bit of air friction and but

3208.24 --> 3214.799
seriously have a vacuum a significant

3210.839 --> 3218.48
vacuum volume suddenly open up somewhere

3214.799 --> 3221.88
and it's like everything shifts why

3218.48 --> 3224.559
because all that gas everywhere is all

3221.88 --> 3227.079
pressing and suddenly in the middle of

3224.559 --> 3229.599
it there's a vacuum available and then

3227.079 --> 3232.52
that entire thing moves and presses and

3229.599 --> 3235.3590000000004
rearranges itself to immediately Ram it

3232.52 --> 3237.319
shut feel that desperately feel that

3235.359 --> 3238.52
it's one of the most powerful forces

3237.319 --> 3242.48
known in the

3238.52 --> 3244.359
universe like even in Helio centrism

3242.48 --> 3247.2
although they T yeah they ignore it

3244.359 --> 3252.48
completely in favor of their model

3247.2 --> 3254.52
existing but yeah it's a mighty force

3252.48 --> 3257.319
and when there is a vacuum suddenly

3254.52 --> 3259.359
available like you suddenly know how

3257.319 --> 3261.4
much pressure there really is in the air

3259.359 --> 3264.64
because it all will just

3261.4 --> 3267.48
W right if you ever experience an

3264.64 --> 3271.839
implosion near

3267.48 --> 3274.48
you then you might know that Sensation

3271.839 --> 3277.0
that you suddenly become aware of how

3274.48 --> 3279.28
what the air is and that it's doing

3277.0 --> 3280.92
something because all of a sudden

3279.28 --> 3283.92
there's a vacuum somewhere or an

3280.92 --> 3289.799
implosion and then it all just boom it

3283.92 --> 3291.359
just uniformly all boom presses right to

3289.799 --> 3294.079
that spot it's

3291.359 --> 3297.0789999999997
crazy but that's what it

3294.079 --> 3297.079
does

3302.92 --> 3307.079
what is density I was T it was mass per

3308.04 --> 3315.319
volume well

3311.64 --> 3319.2
no but you can like calculate it that

3315.319 --> 3322.96
way you can like try to this derive

3319.2 --> 3322.96
information from it oh my God

3324.0 --> 3327.0
freaking

3425.24 --> 3429.839
water vapor is just dense why the hell

3427.48 --> 3429.839
was it

3430.839 --> 3435.92
muted yeah it's a weird thing you just

3433.039 --> 3439.5200000000004
said there clear density of air is

3435.92 --> 3444.039
determined by its water content

3439.52 --> 3449.0
no but if water vapor is in the air then

3444.039 --> 3449.0
that air average density will be

3465.68 --> 3472.64
higher what is the other way

3469.319 --> 3472.64
to I don't

3473.799 --> 3478.88
know

3475.4 --> 3484.1600000000003
the point is it's the the the splitting

3478.88 --> 3484.1600000000003
it apart Stevie whim is completely

3485.039 --> 3489.039
irrelevant

3486.72 --> 3490.72
why I mean yeah you could have the

3489.039 --> 3493.7200000000003
volume about

3490.72 --> 3493.72
it

3494.28 --> 3499.3190000000004
sure but it doesn't make any sense like

3497.599 --> 3502.799
you had just have the

3499.319 --> 3505.64
density and that's

3502.799 --> 3508.24
it I mean technically if you like

3505.64 --> 3512.0389999999998
depressurize something and just let less

3508.24 --> 3516.24
gas in in a bigger chamber well then

3512.039 --> 3519.0
technically the density of it is

3516.24 --> 3522.2
lower than like in a normal State

3519.0 --> 3523.92
because yeah it's thinner it's threading

3522.2 --> 3528.24
thinner and then the density is

3523.92 --> 3530.96
literally going to be lower then

3528.24 --> 3533.16
yeah so the only way you can even like

3530.96 --> 3535.64
properly set any kind of density

3533.16 --> 3536.92
standard is by comparing the density of

3535.64 --> 3540.92
a

3536.92 --> 3542.2000000000003
gas versus the regular at ground level

3540.92 --> 3545.079
air

3542.2 --> 3548.7599999999998
pressure because gas definitely the

3545.079 --> 3552.44
density changes yeah you take a bit of

3548.76 --> 3555.6800000000003
gas you have it in a in a in a

3552.44 --> 3557.68
chamber right it has a certain density

3555.68 --> 3560.2
it will have a certain pressure now you

3557.68 --> 3562.5589999999997
release half of

3560.2 --> 3564.319
that because it was pressurized now it's

3562.559 --> 3565.6800000000003
less PR guess what the density is

3564.319 --> 3571.0
different

3565.68 --> 3573.1189999999997
now because there's less of it divided

3571.0 --> 3576.119
within the same volume now it has a

3573.119 --> 3579.6400000000003
lower density C is pointless it's

3576.119 --> 3581.76
pointless to try to oh let's split it up

3579.64 --> 3585.2
in elements what's the what's the volume

3581.76 --> 3588.6800000000003
what's the mass of it no it just has a

3585.2 --> 3590.5589999999997
density and that density can differ like

3588.68 --> 3593.64
of the same material it can have a

3590.559 --> 3596.119
different density because it's different

3593.64 --> 3599.5989999999997
pressure

3596.119 --> 3599.599
so there's no

3600.76 --> 3609.6800000000003
point you can't fundamentally get an

3605.64 --> 3614.8799999999997
anchorable trait out of

3609.68 --> 3620.68
it you can't pin it down gas is dynamic

3614.88 --> 3624.1600000000003
it's elusive as hell can't even see

3620.68 --> 3627.0789999999997
it can't pin it down to like oh this is

3624.16 --> 3630.3999999999996
this is the mass it has this is no no

3627.079 --> 3630.4
you can't it's

3631.48 --> 3637.76
Dynamic

3633.559 --> 3640.3190000000004
but all that Dynamic nature is very

3637.76 --> 3644.5200000000004
equal for different gases so yeah all

3640.319 --> 3646.799
the gases will spread out and half their

3644.52 --> 3650.68
density when you release half of the

3646.799 --> 3652.44
pressure within the same volume with any

3650.68 --> 3655.2799999999997
gas that's all going to be the same

3652.44 --> 3658.359
response but when you put it together

3655.28 --> 3660.2400000000002
well then one gas in both States is

3658.359 --> 3662.2
always going to be a little bit more

3660.24 --> 3664.4399999999996
dense than the other gas as long as it's

3662.2 --> 3667.5589999999997
separated although it will eventually

3664.44 --> 3667.559
just mix up

3678.359 --> 3684.0389999999998
right no return of the Mac I definitely

3682.039 --> 3685.4
don't think that that's absolutely

3684.039 --> 3689.1600000000003
absurd

3685.4 --> 3689.1600000000003
and a violation of natural

3689.359 --> 3695.799
law

3691.16 --> 3697.7599999999998
yeah there is no vacuum in nature nature

3695.799 --> 3700.88
abhor a

3697.76 --> 3703.28
vacuum it's a violation there can't be a

3700.88 --> 3704.48
vacuum right next to gas pressure that

3703.28 --> 3708.3190000000004
is

3704.48 --> 3713.2
impossible the entire volume of gas will

3708.319 --> 3717.16
explode to fill the vacuum explode all

3713.2 --> 3720.52
of it the entire volume will explode

3717.16 --> 3723.3999999999996
moving towards the vacuum to fill it

3720.52 --> 3726.44
there is no vacuum next to gas pressure

3723.4 --> 3729.2400000000002
there might be a bit lower pressure

3726.44 --> 3731.2000000000003
there's no vacuum the lower pressure

3729.24 --> 3732.5589999999997
might be there because of dramatic

3731.2 --> 3735.96
temperature

3732.559 --> 3738.6800000000003
influences cold a lot a lot of lot of

3735.96 --> 3742.4
cold then guess what the pressure will

3738.68 --> 3745.839
turn out to become lower in that part of

3742.4 --> 3749.119
the available volume and any gas can

3745.839 --> 3750.16
basically go there and then also adapt

3749.119 --> 3752.2400000000002
to

3750.16 --> 3756.359
become lower

3752.24 --> 3758.799
density lower lower pressure all

3756.359 --> 3761.319
that and then it will move out of it

3758.799 --> 3763.64
again and go to another region and and

3761.319 --> 3765.7599999999998
then have the same happen there in the

3763.64 --> 3767.68
other direction yeah at ground level oh

3765.76 --> 3769.96
now it's more dense now it's more

3767.68 --> 3773.64
pressure yeah because there's more heat

3769.96 --> 3774.96
there and so the gas is more heated down

3773.64 --> 3776.68
here

3774.96 --> 3779.359
and there's even gases coming out of the

3776.68 --> 3779.359
ground and all

3779.96 --> 3784.92
that and so there's going to be more

3782.119 --> 3788.559
pressure down here and there's lower

3784.92 --> 3792.599
pressure up there but there's no

3788.559 --> 3796.039
vacuum nature uphor a vacuum there is no

3792.599 --> 3797.599
you can't cool gas down to the point

3796.039 --> 3800.3190000000004
where it will form a

3797.599 --> 3804.4
vacuum that doesn't

3800.319 --> 3806.119
happen there is like a minimum pressure

3804.4 --> 3808.559
I

3806.119 --> 3812.0
think haven't actually really looked

3808.559 --> 3814.4
into that that would be interesting or

3812.0 --> 3818.039
probably be kind of an obscured study

3814.4 --> 3819.6800000000003
though within physics because it's again

3818.039 --> 3821.4
pointing at how outer space is

3819.68 --> 3824.7599999999998
completely

3821.4 --> 3827.44
impossible but there should be like a

3824.76 --> 3827.44
minimum

3827.76 --> 3836.279
pressure that that gas will

3833.279 --> 3836.279
excert

3840.48 --> 3847.68
like or that's it's not the right way to

3843.2 --> 3850.359
say it a maxim like a gradient maximum

3847.68 --> 3853.1189999999997
there should be like a well-defined

3850.359 --> 3856.0789999999997
gradient maximum like you have a total

3853.119 --> 3858.4
volume you have a pressure how much can

3856.079 --> 3861.079
that volume be made to

3858.4 --> 3862.92
gradiate how much pressure difference

3861.079 --> 3864.88
can you create from one side of the

3862.92 --> 3868.559
volume to the other and there should be

3864.88 --> 3871.44
a maximum differential in this based on

3868.559 --> 3874.599
like Ultra temperature influences like

3871.44 --> 3877.64
absolute zero on one side like

3874.599 --> 3880.44
constantly flowing liquid nitrogen right

3877.64 --> 3884.0
super super mega Ultra cold and on the

3880.44 --> 3884.0
other side like I don't know

3884.24 --> 3887.24
man

3888.319 --> 3893.16
like just the hottest freaking torch you

3892.0 --> 3896.92
can

3893.16 --> 3898.839
imagine hot enough yeah yeah so hot but

3896.92 --> 3900.6800000000003
not too hot that it would literally

3898.839 --> 3903.0
destroy the container the gas is

3900.68 --> 3905.319
supposed to be sticking in but to just

3903.0 --> 3908.119
maximize the temperature differential to

3905.319 --> 3912.2
see what is the

3908.119 --> 3915.76
maximum pressure differential between

3912.2 --> 3919.0789999999997
within one gradient there should be a

3915.76 --> 3921.8390000000004
maximum and it should absolutely never

3919.079 --> 3924.92
have a possibility of a vacuum forming

3921.839 --> 3928.52
within that like no matter how

3924.92 --> 3928.52
high and low you you make the

3929.359 --> 3935.0789999999997
temperatures because it's a natural law

3931.96 --> 3937.2
like is no it vacuum really doesn't form

3935.079 --> 3941.079
within a gas naturally under any

3937.2 --> 3945.0389999999998
circumstance it can't happen it can only

3941.079 --> 3947.6800000000003
happen by creating a a separated

3945.039 --> 3951.1600000000003
container and then evacuating that

3947.68 --> 3953.0789999999997
separated container from gas it can

3951.16 --> 3955.3999999999996
never happen

3953.079 --> 3958.7200000000003
naturally it doesn't do

3955.4 --> 3960.319
that a vacuum can never form naturally

3958.72 --> 3963.839
without a solid

3960.319 --> 3969.52
container separating it that volume from

3963.839 --> 3969.52
the the hole it's impossible naturally

3970.119 --> 3975.1600000000003
impossible all right I'm going to get my

3972.2 --> 3975.16
coffee I'll be right

3983.0 --> 3986.0
back

4013.0 --> 4016.0
for

4042.92 --> 4045.92
and

4047.96 --> 4051.119
hey snowing

4059.039 --> 4066.7200000000003
again are specific yeah sure

4062.559 --> 4066.7200000000003
Clary sure you tested it

4068.88 --> 4075.44
yourself now gradients are not specific

4071.799 --> 4077.48
to altitude gradient can form within

4075.44 --> 4079.359
containers that we can

4077.48 --> 4084.079
create

4079.359 --> 4086.48
clear so it's not altitude specific

4084.079 --> 4086.48
you're

4093.92 --> 4100.08
incorrect oh you changing the barbecue

4096.52 --> 4102.839000000001
gas tank per kilogram no that's yeah but

4100.08 --> 4104.92
that's just colloquial weight though

4102.839 --> 4108.92
yeah

4104.92 --> 4112.319
it's in a tank it's way more pressurized

4108.92 --> 4114.4800000000005
and most of it like by the time you

4112.319 --> 4116.759
actually get like a kilogram or anything

4114.48 --> 4119.759
like that's not gas anymore it's it's

4116.759 --> 4122.44
pressurized so much within the tanker

4119.759 --> 4125.199
it's probably going to be

4122.44 --> 4128.3189999999995
liquid it's definitely not going to be

4125.199 --> 4131.759
gas in its expanded state which has no

4128.319 --> 4134.52
weight literally because couldn't

4131.759 --> 4140.0
because weight is a convention based

4134.52 --> 4140.0
within the medium of air at ground level

4140.52 --> 4146.6
pressure so you can't have gas in an

4143.719 --> 4149.44
expanded State weigh anything or have

4146.6 --> 4152.4800000000005
mass that's literally impossible but if

4149.44 --> 4155.839
you pressurize it enormously in a

4152.48 --> 4159.239
separated container yeah then eventually

4155.839 --> 4159.239
it's basically not gas

4159.48 --> 4165.718999999999
anymore and it will then

4162.159 --> 4165.719
attain weight

4170.239 --> 4176.12
property

4172.04 --> 4179.319
yeah that's what it does so yeah you

4176.12 --> 4180.64
could buy it in kilograms or however

4179.319 --> 4183.279
they do

4180.64 --> 4185.12
it because yeah if you pressurize it

4183.279 --> 4188.679
enough it's literally not a gas anymore

4185.12 --> 4192.44
it becomes liquid or something else Z2

4188.679 --> 4192.4400000000005
becomes Crystal I've

4192.719 --> 4195.719
heard

4197.199 --> 4204.28
so yeah well guess what yeah it's not

4200.36 --> 4207.92
like oh you can't weigh the consistent

4204.28 --> 4209.5599999999995
elements of gas no no if you if they

4207.92 --> 4212.76
weren't gas then those elements

4209.56 --> 4215.080000000001
definitely you could weigh them so yeah

4212.76 --> 4217.08
you just you want to weigh gas well then

4215.08 --> 4219.679
you have to pressurize it until it's not

4217.08 --> 4222.199
gas anymore then it becomes liquid or

4219.679 --> 4225.32
solid and then it attains weight that's

4222.199 --> 4228.32
right but while it's in its gas a state

4225.32 --> 4232.08
specially expanded it doesn't have a

4228.32 --> 4233.48
linear weight influence it can't it's

4232.08 --> 4238.0
impossible

4233.48 --> 4241.32
because it's weighed in itself and so

4238.0 --> 4244.159
there's no relative density differential

4241.32 --> 4244.159
to cause any

4248.88 --> 4254.0
pressure yeah hi ran

4251.76 --> 4255.8
Johnson keep following me around I don't

4254.0 --> 4261.28
know what the hell you are I think

4255.8 --> 4261.28
you're a troll but fine you got it

4265.0 --> 4272.28
right just stop with the with the

4268.04 --> 4272.28
annoying remarks in my comment section

4273.96 --> 4280.36
please I'm I'm removing them

4277.52 --> 4283.0
anyway but

4280.36 --> 4285.28
uh if you actually want to have like

4283.0 --> 4287.92
more prop interaction then just stop

4285.28 --> 4287.92
doing that

4299.84 --> 4308.12
please right anyway could probably put

4304.239 --> 4308.12
this in the title the whole gas

4312.56 --> 4315.56
thing

4321.04 --> 4325.32
hey Anan katarsis yeah it's been

4342.48 --> 4345.48
ages

4356.11 --> 4360.648999999999
[Applause]

4357.52 --> 4360.649
[Music]

4370.04 --> 4372.28
damn

4372.44 --> 4375.44
it

4392.71 --> 4395.81
[Music]

4399.0 --> 4405.36
H yeah that could

4402.36 --> 4405.36
work

4407.28 --> 4412.08
gas gradients are not layers gas moves

4410.12 --> 4413.92
freely in between

4412.08 --> 4418.0
pressures

4413.92 --> 4420.12
yeah to really clarify that

4418.0 --> 4421.92
understanding it's like oh it's a

4420.12 --> 4423.92
different gr different pressure there

4421.92 --> 4428.92
than there it's like oh so it's a layer

4423.92 --> 4431.52
no all that gas is still like uniformly

4428.92 --> 4434.04
pressing is just another influence that

4431.52 --> 4435.88
causes it to naturally be

4434.04 --> 4439.56
lower pressure over there and higher

4435.88 --> 4443.36
pressure over there it's still a hole in

4439.56 --> 4446.04
homogeneous mesh and every piece of gas

4443.36 --> 4448.04
within it is still moving all over the

4446.04 --> 4449.28
place to the lower pressure to the

4448.04 --> 4452.76
higher

4449.28 --> 4455.48
pressure but while it is at the lower

4452.76 --> 4459.4800000000005
pressure or at the higher pressure it

4455.48 --> 4462.48
adapts to the surrounding influence

4459.48 --> 4464.0
there so that's what's actually going on

4462.48 --> 4466.239
see

4464.0 --> 4468.84
the gas gradient isn't a

4466.239 --> 4471.678999999999
layer like with a

4468.84 --> 4474.96
liquid it's just another influence

4471.679 --> 4477.76
causing all of that gas to behave

4474.96 --> 4480.32
differently have a different pressure

4477.76 --> 4483.4800000000005
but it's still treated as a

4480.32 --> 4486.599999999999
whole because it's still moving in

4483.48 --> 4486.599999999999
between the different

4486.76 --> 4493.92
gradients it's just different when it's

4490.52 --> 4496.8
there when it happens to pass by

4493.92 --> 4499.28
low pressure Town you adapt to low

4496.8 --> 4501.639
pressure town then you go to the high

4499.28 --> 4505.0
press City and guess what you're going

4501.639 --> 4508.84
to act like a high press City gas like

4505.0 --> 4508.84
that's what it does that's how it

4509.639 --> 4515.36
is the gas within it is still moving all

4512.84 --> 4515.360000000001
over the

4521.8 --> 4527.4800000000005
place at pressure is

4524.6 --> 4530.4800000000005
presupposed from the weight of

4527.48 --> 4533.678999999999
mercury uh I'm

4530.48 --> 4537.28
sure but I mean pressure is like a a

4533.679 --> 4538.92
barometric pressure system like it's

4537.28 --> 4540.92
just yeah you have one pressure and then

4538.92 --> 4543.28
you have the pressure of the outside and

4540.92 --> 4546.36
it's like yeah one presses against the

4543.28 --> 4549.28
other one stays perfectly the same in

4546.36 --> 4552.08
order for you to use that as an anchor

4549.28 --> 4552.08
to compare the

4552.199 --> 4555.199
pressure

4558.0 --> 4563.36
gases we don't need no stinking gases

4560.8 --> 4566.52
very funny I think we do though I we

4563.36 --> 4566.5199999999995
like to breathe you

4572.28 --> 4578.32
know measuring

4575.32 --> 4578.32
what

4581.52 --> 4585.88
yeah no it's just comparing pressures

4584.239 --> 4588.678999999999
that's what it that's what how you

4585.88 --> 4590.84
measure the pressure you compare it to a

4588.679 --> 4592.6
pressure that's how you know what

4590.84 --> 4595.28
pressure It Is by comparing it to

4592.6 --> 4597.84
another pressure just have one pressure

4595.28 --> 4600.92
be absolutely perfectly consistent at

4597.84 --> 4603.8
all time no matter what and then you can

4600.92 --> 4607.1990000000005
use that as an anchor to compare

4603.8 --> 4609.08
pressures to know what the pressure is

4607.199 --> 4612.08
in the air

4609.08 --> 4615.08
right that's how it

4612.08 --> 4615.08
works

4630.92 --> 4635.2390000000005
right I mean yeah it's kind of weird

4633.679 --> 4639.08
clear to say

4635.239 --> 4641.08
that because Mercury is also measured is

4639.08 --> 4644.08
also used to measure

4641.08 --> 4646.48
temperature it's called a th therometer

4644.08 --> 4649.44
right so what does it do does it measure

4646.48 --> 4652.44
the pressure or does it measure the

4649.44 --> 4652.44
temperature

4657.159 --> 4664.4
H I think it could just do whatever you

4661.639 --> 4667.159000000001
utilize however you utilize it in a

4664.4 --> 4670.44
man-made device to measure I think you

4667.159 --> 4675.0
could probably measure pressure with it

4670.44 --> 4677.44
and temperature and hey both

4675.0 --> 4679.28
right they're very close to one another

4677.44 --> 4682.159
right I mean you you heighten the

4679.28 --> 4684.4
temperature you heighten the pressure

4682.159 --> 4687.48
literally lower the temperature lower

4684.4 --> 4691.44
the pressure yeah well so it's it's a

4687.48 --> 4694.919999999999
two-way stream they're they're both both

4691.44 --> 4694.919999999999
the same type of

4697.84 --> 4701.88
influences right it's like you create

4700.4 --> 4704.879999999999
the higher pressure well there's

4701.88 --> 4707.04
probably going to be things heating up

4704.88 --> 4708.92
then you're going to deep pressure well

4707.04 --> 4711.639
things are probably going to cool off

4708.92 --> 4713.32
then oh you're going to heat it up well

4711.639 --> 4715.2390000000005
then probably things are going to get a

4713.32 --> 4717.04
bit more pressurized oh you're going to

4715.239 --> 4720.638999999999
cool it off well things are going to

4717.04 --> 4723.36
probably depressurize a bit then yeah

4720.639 --> 4723.36
that's how it

4730.4 --> 4734.92
works hello Aiden James

4737.56 --> 4743.92
always come in with your first comment

4740.52 --> 4746.320000000001
just with a DOT that's not a proper

4743.92 --> 4746.32
entry

4761.84 --> 4766.639
dude

4763.76 --> 4769.2390000000005
Freddy Mercury was under pressure I'm

4766.639 --> 4769.2390000000005
sure he

4779.159 --> 4785.5199999999995
was probably quite frequently had a

4781.719 --> 4788.28
thermometer up his ass as well but uh

4785.52 --> 4788.280000000001
yeah nobody

4791.84 --> 4794.84
cares

4819.36 --> 4824.759999999999
so FAS water

4821.76 --> 4824.76
cavitates

4825.0 --> 4831.76
itical column what what does that

4828.96 --> 4834.8
mean what the hell is what does

4831.76 --> 4834.8
cavitation even

4834.84 --> 4838.4800000000005
mean [ __ ]

4843.639 --> 4846.639
hell

4848.719 --> 4854.719
okay

4851.719 --> 4854.719
h

4856.04 --> 4862.679
whoa okay cavitation formation of vapor

4859.719 --> 4865.199
bubbles within a liquid at low pressure

4862.679 --> 4869.32
regions that occur in places where the

4865.199 --> 4869.32
liquid has been accelerated to high

4869.8 --> 4876.4400000000005
velocities

4872.639 --> 4878.84
bro so that's like a side of it's

4876.44 --> 4881.759999999999
basically water

4878.84 --> 4883.8
evaporation under extreme circumstances

4881.76 --> 4886.719
like extremo

4883.8 --> 4890.719
then some of it will still just evapor

4886.719 --> 4890.719
cavitation wow that's weird

4895.92 --> 4901.88
man I have heard of the word before

4900.0 --> 4904.92
though it's just one of those

4901.88 --> 4907.32
engineering words hey steamy traveler

4904.92 --> 4907.32
good to see

4911.639 --> 4914.639
you

4921.12 --> 4926.239
pumps do it

4922.6 --> 4928.280000000001
too it's interesting it's interesting to

4926.239 --> 4930.959999999999
I would like to know more about that

4928.28 --> 4932.8
like it seems like if it's a problem if

4930.96 --> 4935.92
cavitation is a problem then it should

4932.8 --> 4938.84
be something that could be

4935.92 --> 4941.159
perfectly understood and bypassed with

4938.84 --> 4943.32
proper engineering

4941.159 --> 4946.679
designs I think

4943.32 --> 4946.679
I mean that would make sense to

4952.12 --> 4957.28
me it makes light what what are you

4955.0 --> 4957.28
talking

4959.92 --> 4964.4
about all right I hope you're all having

4961.96 --> 4967.08
a good time here glad to finally have a

4964.4 --> 4968.92
bit of a physics subject back right

4967.08 --> 4972.159
because I talk

4968.92 --> 4974.08
physics I do that all by myself I'm not

4972.159 --> 4976.879999999999
just talking about physics because I

4974.08 --> 4979.96
hang around with guys that that you can

4976.88 --> 4979.96
talk with it

4982.44 --> 4987.919999999999
about

4984.8 --> 4989.56
right I've picked up enough for a

4987.92 --> 4991.92
lifetime already I mean I could

4989.56 --> 4993.76
literally go another 10 years just

4991.92 --> 4996.6
rolling out everything that I've learned

4993.76 --> 4999.6
in the last

4996.6 --> 4999.6
five

5000.199 --> 5005.28
serious it's probably going to take that

5002.76 --> 5008.92
long for people all to have that

5005.28 --> 5012.88
understood as much as I

5008.92 --> 5016.84
do and we're working on it right

5012.88 --> 5019.56
now that's why this freaking gas weight

5016.84 --> 5022.88
issue continually comes back over and

5019.56 --> 5025.88
over and over again it's like one show

5022.88 --> 5027.8
about it at least every month and

5025.88 --> 5030.4800000000005
usually when I do it's going to be like

5027.8 --> 5033.159000000001
three shows in a row and it keeps

5030.48 --> 5035.199
happening cuz people just won't get it

5033.159 --> 5037.839999999999
and then every time I do it I get the

5035.199 --> 5040.28
same people spamming the same hor [ __ ]

5037.84 --> 5042.96
in my comment section every time and

5040.28 --> 5042.96
they keep doing

5044.56 --> 5051.1990000000005
it and I keep replying with the same

5048.0 --> 5054.48
things until I get sick of

5051.199 --> 5057.44
it because it's like yeah but it's it's

5054.48 --> 5058.759999999999
addressed we address that this is how

5057.44 --> 5061.36
it's wrong this is where it's a

5058.76 --> 5063.320000000001
misconception this is what's

5061.36 --> 5066.599999999999
happening

5063.32 --> 5071.199
right the whole weight thing like weight

5066.6 --> 5074.88
is not one uniform thing that's the

5071.199 --> 5077.32
problem weight is mostly a

5074.88 --> 5079.119
convention like that's what we use right

5077.32 --> 5081.719
when you put something on a scale it has

5079.119 --> 5083.719
a weight number why does it have a

5081.719 --> 5087.2390000000005
weight number well because that's what

5083.719 --> 5089.76
the scale says and but that scale system

5087.239 --> 5092.04
that pressure measuring system is

5089.76 --> 5094.1990000000005
measures pressure that's what actually

5092.04 --> 5097.96
happen so weight in that sense is

5094.199 --> 5100.678999999999
pressure but it's not just pressure it's

5097.96 --> 5103.96
a numerological prance of pressure it's

5100.679 --> 5106.52
a number to it an

5103.96 --> 5108.719
amount but how does it happen how does

5106.52 --> 5111.4800000000005
weight even happen why does do things

5108.719 --> 5114.4
press on that scale well that all

5111.48 --> 5117.5599999999995
happens because of relative density it's

5114.4 --> 5118.759999999999
because for example you in your body or

5117.56 --> 5122.679
the thing you're going to put on the

5118.76 --> 5124.360000000001
scale is way more dense than the air

5122.679 --> 5126.4800000000005
that surrounds it I mean I'm going to

5124.36 --> 5129.119
take that you're probably going to weigh

5126.48 --> 5132.159
most of the things you weigh in

5129.119 --> 5135.44
air because that's how the convention of

5132.159 --> 5136.638999999999
weight works it's weight in air you

5135.44 --> 5139.719
weigh

5136.639 --> 5141.84
something put it on a scale in air at

5139.719 --> 5144.08
ground level then it will have a very

5141.84 --> 5146.400000000001
specific type of disequilibrium with

5144.08 --> 5149.0
that air because of its height and

5146.4 --> 5150.679
density because it's a solid thing it's

5149.0 --> 5151.96
going to be more dense than the air

5150.679 --> 5153.96
everything that's solid is pretty much

5151.96 --> 5157.159
more dense than the a there's no solid

5153.96 --> 5159.44
material that's less dense than air

5157.159 --> 5161.5199999999995
there's probably rumors of that space

5159.44 --> 5163.759999999999
foam or blah blah blah what yeah it's

5161.52 --> 5166.320000000001
all very cute yeah I haven't seen it

5163.76 --> 5167.84
though there's very light materials that

5166.32 --> 5171.639
can like create a bit of lift like

5167.84 --> 5175.92
certain Foams and all that but it still

5171.639 --> 5178.1990000000005
give it time entropy it will all go down

5175.92 --> 5181.08
there is no solid material that's

5178.199 --> 5182.799999999999
literally like helium going to like no

5181.08 --> 5184.639
it's just going to stay there because

5182.8 --> 5187.639
it's lighter than the air like no that

5184.639 --> 5188.639
doesn't exist all solid materials are

5187.639 --> 5192.08
more

5188.639 --> 5194.400000000001
dense than gases that's just that's just

5192.08 --> 5194.4
what it

5194.44 --> 5200.839999999999
is

5197.239 --> 5204.04
right so you put something on the

5200.84 --> 5206.76
scale you measure the total pressure

5204.04 --> 5210.119
that the dis equilibrium of it its

5206.76 --> 5213.92
density compared to the air surrounding

5210.119 --> 5216.92
it has and then you get a a number to it

5213.92 --> 5221.4
a total number and that's weight that's

5216.92 --> 5224.679
air based weight or just weight and

5221.4 --> 5227.4
that's the convention that we

5224.679 --> 5230.4800000000005
use right based of relative density dise

5227.4 --> 5233.32
equilibrium measured in preponderance of

5230.48 --> 5236.4
pressure but then there's all kinds of

5233.32 --> 5239.48
weird old conceptual ideas about weight

5236.4 --> 5243.48
like Newtonian weight that it's

5239.48 --> 5246.32
actually like a force that it's gravity

5243.48 --> 5249.678999999999
unleashing itself on the mass of

5246.32 --> 5252.04
material and that's what's causing that

5249.679 --> 5254.0
pressure then that we register as weight

5252.04 --> 5257.48
that's the idea of Newtonian mechanics

5254.0 --> 5257.48
and that thing is completely

5258.28 --> 5264.239
wrong it's completely wrong and that's

5261.36 --> 5267.44
really why there's people still throwing

5264.239 --> 5270.239
out objections over over me saying that

5267.44 --> 5272.5599999999995
hey gas doesn't have weight but it has

5270.239 --> 5276.28
to because of notan mechanics cuz gas go

5272.56 --> 5276.280000000001
down go boom boom or it can be a

5276.719 --> 5282.56
ball yeah that's why it has to be

5280.4 --> 5286.239
readdressed over and over

5282.56 --> 5289.1990000000005
again because hey there is weight it's

5286.239 --> 5292.159
not Newtonian based weight though yeah

5289.199 --> 5295.04
those formulas don't apply Newtonian

5292.159 --> 5297.839999999999
mechanics have been debunked it didn't

5295.04 --> 5301.679
take into account gas

5297.84 --> 5304.8
behavior because in the Newtonian model

5301.679 --> 5308.4400000000005
every everything goes down goes boom

5304.8 --> 5310.320000000001
boom there's a universal one directional

5308.44 --> 5313.239
Force that's called gravitation

5310.32 --> 5315.679
according to that and it can bend into a

5313.239 --> 5318.08
ball whatever that's all secondary

5315.679 --> 5321.159
really to just the universal mechanic of

5318.08 --> 5323.119
everything goes down that's neonian

5321.159 --> 5325.44
mechanics yeah well guess what gas does

5323.119 --> 5327.839999999999
not go down go boom boom neonian

5325.44 --> 5332.08
mechanics are totally

5327.84 --> 5334.0
debunked but wait the convention of a

5332.08 --> 5337.04
scale measuring pressure because of

5334.0 --> 5340.719
relative density disequilibrium with the

5337.04 --> 5344.719
surrounding that is a real thing it's

5340.719 --> 5347.679
just not Newtonian in nature at all it's

5344.719 --> 5347.679
relative density

5347.8 --> 5354.159000000001
based because relative density is real

5350.84 --> 5357.6
it's it's so real it's so reliable and

5354.159 --> 5359.679
consistent and dynamic in how you how

5357.6 --> 5363.88
you can figure it

5359.679 --> 5365.96
out that it is arguably a natural law

5363.88 --> 5368.88
that's what the guys at fed say at least

5365.96 --> 5371.44
I I don't really care I mean scientific

5368.88 --> 5373.52
is good enough I mean you can formulate

5371.44 --> 5378.32
it with a scientific hypothesis and and

5373.52 --> 5380.4400000000005
do it so that's awesome I mean to to

5378.32 --> 5382.84
just have a thing and say yeah this is

5380.44 --> 5385.36
literally scientific that's like a a

5382.84 --> 5387.52
luxury these days because hey so much

5385.36 --> 5388.5199999999995
PSE suda science everywhere like most

5387.52 --> 5390.52
people don't even know what the

5388.52 --> 5392.320000000001
scientific method is and they still will

5390.52 --> 5396.080000000001
claim science well guess what relative

5392.32 --> 5399.0
density is legitimately

5396.08 --> 5402.239
scientific it follows the

5399.0 --> 5403.88
hypothesis system of science perfectly

5402.239 --> 5408.959999999999
scientific

5403.88 --> 5412.36
method and it proves it that that is the

5408.96 --> 5416.639
cause of vertical displacement passive

5412.36 --> 5420.92
displacement of matter it's the density

5416.639 --> 5422.56
increase of an object causes it to

5420.92 --> 5425.52
create a dise equilibrium with the

5422.56 --> 5428.159000000001
surrounding and that then makes it want

5425.52 --> 5430.76
to go down it will force it down the

5428.159 --> 5433.5599999999995
force will arise because of the

5430.76 --> 5435.1990000000005
disequilibrium or if it's less dense

5433.56 --> 5437.04
than the surrounding then that same

5435.199 --> 5439.799999999999
force will happen but exactly the

5437.04 --> 5443.84
opposite direction it will want to go up

5439.8 --> 5446.52
because it's less dense it will want to

5443.84 --> 5448.6
float like an air bubble in water it

5446.52 --> 5451.4800000000005
wants to go up because it's less dense

5448.6 --> 5455.400000000001
than in water it wants to go up it's a

5451.48 --> 5455.4
dis equilibrium with the water it goes

5455.76 --> 5460.4800000000005
up and that's relative density it's

5458.239 --> 5464.119
scientific it's

5460.48 --> 5466.28
valid very happy to like work that out

5464.119 --> 5468.799999999999
even though technically already existed

5466.28 --> 5471.44
this is usually just called density and

5468.8 --> 5473.4400000000005
you can even find it within the physics

5471.44 --> 5475.719
Community if you kind of dig under

5473.44 --> 5478.799999999999
specific gravity they have to of course

5475.719 --> 5480.76
like put a gravity on there even though

5478.8 --> 5484.56
it has literally no gravity within it

5480.76 --> 5487.119000000001
it's not related to anything

5484.56 --> 5489.04
gravitational or anything but they they

5487.119 --> 5490.4
have to call it that of course it's like

5489.04 --> 5492.44
oh this is the real thing so we're going

5490.4 --> 5494.28
to call it

5492.44 --> 5496.44
gravity

5494.28 --> 5498.32
right just like they have to call

5496.44 --> 5500.44
everything Quantum now even though it

5498.32 --> 5502.84
will absolutely have nothing to do with

5500.44 --> 5505.599999999999
quantum mechanics whatsoever I still

5502.84 --> 5507.1990000000005
call it quantum right and and just like

5505.6 --> 5509.8
that they they had to do that with

5507.199 --> 5512.0
relative density is like yeah yeah this

5509.8 --> 5513.8
is how it really works yeah new

5512.0 --> 5515.639
mechanics doesn't work Einstein

5513.8 --> 5517.84
SpaceTime bending is

5515.639 --> 5519.92
conceptual but this is what actually

5517.84 --> 5522.52
causes the passive displacement and

5519.92 --> 5524.32
we're going to call it specific gravity

5522.52 --> 5526.76
yeah that's the that's the games they

5524.32 --> 5526.759999999999
play with

5529.119 --> 5533.199
us but that's where you can find

5534.92 --> 5540.2390000000005
it specific gravity as one uh oh

5537.92 --> 5543.32
somebody's ballart just woke

5540.239 --> 5546.199
up it's relative density specific

5543.32 --> 5550.48
gravity is relative density Theory it's

5546.199 --> 5550.48
the formula for it it's how it's

5551.32 --> 5557.5199999999995
adapted and I'm sure that people have

5553.88 --> 5560.32
used it and just said g is and that kind

5557.52 --> 5562.639
of hor [ __ ] like put that right next to

5560.32 --> 5563.799999999999
the formula because of course it has to

5562.639 --> 5566.159000000001
be gravity because we're going to

5563.8 --> 5568.159000000001
presuppose that but it isn't it's

5566.159 --> 5571.719
literally not a part of it it's all

5568.159 --> 5573.5199999999995
density based it is effectively relative

5571.719 --> 5576.28
density but they called it specific

5573.52 --> 5578.6
gravity what the formula for yeah you go

5576.28 --> 5578.599999999999
look it

5579.679 --> 5585.52
up why why are you asking me that you

5583.159 --> 5588.44
can look that up yourself right I mean I

5585.52 --> 5591.2390000000005
literally told you specific gravity is a

5588.44 --> 5591.239
thing out

5593.239 --> 5598.759999999999
there dude I looked up I Googled

5596.0 --> 5600.88
specific gravity and it literally the

5598.76 --> 5602.88
first word that appeared is relative

5600.88 --> 5604.32
density

5602.88 --> 5606.88
whoa

5604.32 --> 5610.84
what holy

5606.88 --> 5614.88
[ __ ] it showed the E experiment not with

5610.84 --> 5614.88
an EG but

5617.6 --> 5622.679
whoa

5620.199 --> 5627.04
bro that's the first time I've ever seen

5622.679 --> 5627.04
that that's awesome I'm G to show

5627.48 --> 5634.04
that it's all that I'm missing is like

5630.04 --> 5634.04
sleeping warrior in his white code or

5634.4 --> 5639.638999999999
something he should be he should be like

5637.239 --> 5642.04
on the front page when that's getting

5639.639 --> 5645.719
Google you should see sleeping warrior

5642.04 --> 5645.719
in his white lab code

5647.719 --> 5650.92
absolutely hold

5654.96 --> 5661.04
on

5656.48 --> 5663.839999999999
right so here here you go relative

5661.04 --> 5666.04
density right I Googled specific

5663.84 --> 5669.400000000001
gravity relative density is the first

5666.04 --> 5674.44
thing that popped up with here things in

5669.4 --> 5678.239
liquid one floating one sinking like

5674.44 --> 5681.239
whoa so who just called

5678.239 --> 5683.5199999999995
it yeah specific gravity I talked about

5681.239 --> 5685.04
relative density well I Googled specific

5683.52 --> 5687.96
gravity relative density is the thing

5685.04 --> 5690.119
that popped up so it seems like Google

5687.96 --> 5692.96
is

5690.119 --> 5696.679
finally getting

5692.96 --> 5701.04
it getting its physics lore straight and

5696.679 --> 5701.04
there's Wikipedia page relative

5701.88 --> 5705.4400000000005
density that's

5707.8 --> 5713.4400000000005
interesting oh here's a formula that's

5710.719 --> 5716.36
cool oh you wanted you wanted to see

5713.44 --> 5718.04
math what's your formula what your for

5716.36 --> 5719.639
well there's the formula here's all math

5718.04 --> 5721.96
I don't give a [ __ ] about it I don't

5719.639 --> 5725.56
even know what that means

5721.96 --> 5727.76
I hate like physics math type [ __ ] I

5725.56 --> 5730.52
hate

5727.76 --> 5732.84
it if I wouldn't have hat it I probably

5730.52 --> 5736.040000000001
would have become just a full-blown

5732.84 --> 5741.2390000000005
physicist but that part the stupid math

5736.04 --> 5741.239
crap on how to describe things I hate

5741.96 --> 5747.08
it right anyway relative density that

5744.92 --> 5747.08
was

5750.4 --> 5755.92
interesting

5753.199 --> 5755.919999999999
so

5758.04 --> 5762.96
yeah if the wood ball floats it must be

5760.8 --> 5762.96
a

5770.84 --> 5779.1990000000005
witch specific gravity is D

5775.32 --> 5782.5599999999995
no stop making up [ __ ] akumu stop

5779.199 --> 5785.28
being a misinformation misinformation

5782.56 --> 5785.280000000001
agent stop

5785.88 --> 5792.76
it don't go like full balart liar on me

5790.679 --> 5796.52
and start creating misinformation

5792.76 --> 5800.119000000001
[ __ ] yeah I just I literally rolled

5796.52 --> 5802.1990000000005
it out like on screen it was highlight

5800.119 --> 5804.92
yeah no yeah that's just one

5802.199 --> 5808.799999999999
demonstration it's not about things in

5804.92 --> 5813.4800000000005
water [ __ ] it's about all things in

5808.8 --> 5817.159000000001
anything in air in water in

5813.48 --> 5817.159
Mercury whatever you

5820.719 --> 5827.92
can it's not specific gravity is not

5823.76 --> 5832.04
about what things do in water yeah it's

5827.92 --> 5832.04
what everything does in everything

5833.199 --> 5840.36
else like what does material do when it

5836.56 --> 5842.679
can move freely when it's not stuck by

5840.36 --> 5845.199
something solid that's what it says

5842.679 --> 5845.1990000000005
that's how it

5860.04 --> 5864.36
works okay woodwork gwh that's

5864.599 --> 5868.119000000001
hilarious that's not

5868.599 --> 5873.1990000000005
literally it's more like family

5876.04 --> 5880.28
density hey harp will not be silent I

5878.96 --> 5883.639
didn't see you

5880.28 --> 5883.639
there how you

5898.159 --> 5903.32
doing

5899.88 --> 5906.119
no return ma that's not a vacuum under

5903.32 --> 5906.119
the scientific

5930.119 --> 5933.119
definition

5938.84 --> 5944.4400000000005
yeah Ste TR I know thanks for spotting

5941.56 --> 5947.2390000000005
that I knew he did Kuma virus always

5944.44 --> 5950.239
does that soon as something becomes too

5947.239 --> 5953.36
overtly in your face about Flat Earth he

5950.239 --> 5955.799999999999
always starts like oh quickly how can we

5953.36 --> 5959.799999999999
misinterpret some of the details to make

5955.8 --> 5962.360000000001
it not so egregiously correct he always

5959.8 --> 5965.96
does that

5962.36 --> 5969.44
this is bolard working itself

5965.96 --> 5973.04
up but thanks for for spotting that

5969.44 --> 5973.04
steamy traveler I appreciate

5974.88 --> 5982.0
that the Google scientific definition of

5977.76 --> 5986.280000000001
a vacuum you see that's it well that's

5982.0 --> 5989.639
nonsense it's lower pressure it's not a

5986.28 --> 5992.96
vacuum nature ofor a vacuum a vacuum

5989.639 --> 5996.96
doesn't exist next to a lower

5992.96 --> 5996.96
pressure is not a vacuum

6002.04 --> 6006.8
then yeah

6003.96 --> 6009.719
0.07 PSI is that doesn't sound like a

6006.8 --> 6012.04
vacuum to me at all it just sounds like

6009.719 --> 6014.56
yeah that's much lower pressure not a

6012.04 --> 6014.56
vacuum

6017.8 --> 6024.52
though yeah yeah 200 *

6021.56 --> 6024.52
not a vacuum

6026.599 --> 6031.88
though yeah and there's a lot of volume

6029.28 --> 6034.759999999999
to have that pressure differential the

6031.88 --> 6036.96
smaller the volume the smaller the

6034.76 --> 6039.639
possible differential in pressure

6036.96 --> 6042.719
between it because of temperature

6039.639 --> 6045.08
influences so yeah it is a pretty damn

6042.719 --> 6047.88
big container right although that's all

6045.08 --> 6049.92
relative to our to ourselves of

6047.88 --> 6053.96
course but

6049.92 --> 6056.56
uh yeah it's not a vacuum though it's

6053.96 --> 6056.56
just lower

6058.32 --> 6063.759999999999
pressure it's always above zero pressure

6061.199 --> 6063.759999999999
yeah so

6065.88 --> 6071.400000000001
what absolute zero is impossible like

6068.96 --> 6071.4
it's not

6079.84 --> 6082.84
achievable

6102.28 --> 6106.36
what the [ __ ] are you getting that from

6109.84 --> 6112.84
kumu

6113.48 --> 6118.44
by water well that's just in that

6115.48 --> 6120.879999999999
specific case that's just specific

6118.44 --> 6122.5599999999995
gravity when applying to the medium of

6120.88 --> 6126.8
water aumo

6122.56 --> 6129.280000000001
virus specific gravity is not

6126.8 --> 6133.159000000001
exclusively for

6129.28 --> 6136.119
water it's just that water is a very con

6133.159 --> 6137.679
convenient average material that's very

6136.119 --> 6140.88
abundantly

6137.679 --> 6144.119
available in order to do the specific

6140.88 --> 6147.08
gravity thing measurement

6144.119 --> 6149.159
test it's not exclusive to water though

6147.08 --> 6152.44
you keep asserting that it's that's

6149.159 --> 6152.44
wrong stop

6155.08 --> 6162.36
lying specific gravity can work with

6159.639 --> 6166.52
anything also works in

6162.36 --> 6166.5199999999995
gas also works in

6168.96 --> 6174.639
mercury in oil

6171.4 --> 6177.719
in whatever you want anything that's not

6174.639 --> 6179.76
just solid because if it's solid then

6177.719 --> 6182.88
there is no maneuverability doesn't have

6179.76 --> 6184.88
the opportunity to find its equilibrium

6182.88 --> 6188.32
with the

6184.88 --> 6188.32
medium because it's

6198.36 --> 6205.48
stuck absolute zero pressure under

6201.08 --> 6208.4
specific terms graic vacum yeah

6205.48 --> 6211.0
indeed so yeah they can call it that

6208.4 --> 6213.759999999999
right they could call it a vacuum all

6211.0 --> 6215.84
they like it isn't a vacuum though

6213.76 --> 6218.8
nature abhor a vacuum if it were a

6215.84 --> 6220.1990000000005
vacuum then the gas would fill it it's

6218.8 --> 6223.4400000000005
lower

6220.199 --> 6225.239
pressure and the only reason it could be

6223.44 --> 6226.638999999999
like that within the realm is because of

6225.239 --> 6229.199
temperature

6226.639 --> 6231.92
differential temperature influences Heat

6229.199 --> 6234.4
at the ground cold at the top top and

6231.92 --> 6238.679
that will cause a pretty dramatic

6234.4 --> 6242.36
differential I'd say 200 200 times

6238.679 --> 6242.36
less that is pretty

6244.0 --> 6250.48
dramatic but yeah I

6247.08 --> 6252.719
mean I would like to know a study if

6250.48 --> 6254.799999999999
there is such a thing on how much

6252.719 --> 6256.08
temperature differential can you get

6254.8 --> 6258.599
within a

6256.08 --> 6261.96
singular space it's

6258.599 --> 6265.119000000001
like if you'd have a tube a closed

6261.96 --> 6267.44
system tube and you like really heat one

6265.119 --> 6270.04
side of it and really make other side

6267.44 --> 6271.638999999999
cold how much temper how much pressure

6270.04 --> 6273.5199999999995
differential could you create within

6271.639 --> 6276.1990000000005
that singular tube right because if it's

6273.52 --> 6279.040000000001
a long stretch tube well

6276.199 --> 6281.5199999999995
then the gases within it have less

6279.04 --> 6283.84
maneuverability opportunity to get all

6281.52 --> 6286.159000000001
the way to the other side so then

6283.84 --> 6287.28
logically the gradient could be bigger I

6286.159 --> 6289.5599999999995
want to

6287.28 --> 6294.48
know how that

6289.56 --> 6299.0
works how much distance within like a

6294.48 --> 6301.48
tube can can allow how much pressure

6299.0 --> 6303.88
differential from one side to the other

6301.48 --> 6306.839999999999
how would that work because then if it's

6303.88 --> 6309.36
like 200 times pressure differential up

6306.84 --> 6312.76
there well then we might even sort of be

6309.36 --> 6315.239
able to like back calculate how high it

6312.76 --> 6315.2390000000005
actually

6315.32 --> 6321.32
is based on the pressure differential

6318.4 --> 6323.5599999999995
because there's probably a very set

6321.32 --> 6326.159
system for that it's like this amount of

6323.56 --> 6328.2390000000005
distance then this amount of possible

6326.159 --> 6330.839999999999
pressure differential within that

6328.239 --> 6330.839999999999
singular

6331.239 --> 6335.879999999999
system no gas does not attract

6339.599 --> 6343.599
gas gas is not a

6347.679 --> 6353.1990000000005
mass yeah don't listen to Akuma it's

6350.199 --> 6354.96
just be being barded G is waet no he

6353.199 --> 6357.839999999999
doesn't you don't know what the [ __ ]

6354.96 --> 6360.08
you're talking about shut the [ __ ] up

6357.84 --> 6363.159000000001
akumu right yeah see you later steamy

6360.08 --> 6363.159
traveler thanks for being

6364.44 --> 6368.598999999999
there gas is a mess that's not the right

6367.119 --> 6373.28
word for

6368.599 --> 6377.4400000000005
it I don't call it a a mass it's a mesh

6373.28 --> 6383.199
Mash mes

6377.44 --> 6383.199
H or is it Mash MH yeah

6386.8 --> 6391.84
mesh how the [ __ ] do we to spell

6392.32 --> 6399.92
that with an a mash is it damn

6396.92 --> 6399.92
it

6400.84 --> 6404.52
just is with an

6406.52 --> 6413.280000000001
a mash with a C Mac yeah what what the

6410.679 --> 6417.56
[ __ ] how the hell do you spell

6413.28 --> 6420.88
mash it must be m e s otherwise but I

6417.56 --> 6423.84
mean oh there's all

6420.88 --> 6426.56
stupid what Mash is a barrier of

6423.84 --> 6430.28
interlace strands of metal what the [ __ ]

6426.56 --> 6434.8
okay no not a

6430.28 --> 6434.8
mash what the hell is the right word for

6439.32 --> 6442.32
this

6452.28 --> 6456.0
MH it must be

6457.639 --> 6461.719
me very confusing

6469.32 --> 6472.32
though

6472.96 --> 6478.76
Dam

6474.159 --> 6481.5199999999995
it proves your point no he does

6478.76 --> 6486.1990000000005
not shut the [ __ ] up Akuma virus before

6481.52 --> 6486.1990000000005
I kick you out stop barding out on

6486.56 --> 6492.52
me I'm just trying to figure out like

6488.92 --> 6492.52
how the hell do you what do you call

6492.76 --> 6498.119000000001
it a mash of air to me is like a

6495.76 --> 6502.2390000000005
preponderance of air it's like just a

6498.119 --> 6502.239
whole bunch of it

6527.4 --> 6532.199
move at different speeds under the same

6529.56 --> 6532.1990000000005
kinetic energy

6538.92 --> 6544.0
okay this isn't even ver this globe

6541.96 --> 6546.8
stuff yeah it is if you're going to

6544.0 --> 6549.679
continually try to invoke gas having

6546.8 --> 6552.360000000001
mass and go down go boom boom yes it is

6549.679 --> 6555.28
aumu virus don't try to mislead us yeah

6552.36 --> 6555.28
it doesn't work

6559.119 --> 6564.679
dummy

6561.96 --> 6567.679
I mean I've known you for like half a

6564.679 --> 6570.52
decade okay I know when you're trying to

6567.679 --> 6570.52
[ __ ] as I

6571.52 --> 6575.2390000000005
again I can smell

6576.44 --> 6579.44
it

6589.119 --> 6592.119
bro

6594.84 --> 6599.96
yeah the black SW doesn't have anything

6596.52 --> 6602.360000000001
to do with gas argument though harp will

6599.96 --> 6602.36
not be

6605.88 --> 6611.1990000000005
silent yeah nothing to do with globe

6608.92 --> 6615.639
yeah it does yeah because in your Globe

6611.199 --> 6619.04
model the gas sticks to a ball versus

6615.639 --> 6624.36
astronomically sized volume of outer

6619.04 --> 6628.159
space extreme low pressure

6624.36 --> 6631.799999999999
yeah so yeah it is it's very

6628.159 --> 6635.04
involved in flat versus glob very very

6631.8 --> 6635.04
involved at all

6649.04 --> 6652.04
definitely

6652.079 --> 6657.719
yeah because gas is not going to stick

6654.96 --> 6660.96
to a ball at a high pressure in a

6657.719 --> 6664.32
relatively low volume without a physical

6660.96 --> 6666.88
containment to keep it there under that

6664.32 --> 6670.0
specific type of level of pressure

6666.88 --> 6673.679
versus like a volume that is

6670.0 --> 6676.04
like endless amounts of times bigger

6673.679 --> 6678.04
than that volume of that high pressure

6676.04 --> 6680.8
relatively close to the

6678.04 --> 6685.36
Earth and then without containment have

6680.8 --> 6688.52
that endless amount of open volume sit

6685.36 --> 6689.96
right next to that way higher pressure

6688.52 --> 6692.679
that's just going to stick there yeah no

6689.96 --> 6692.679
it doesn't do

6695.679 --> 6699.4800000000005
that hey s star

6705.04 --> 6711.92
water there's no refuting jto media fits

6708.76 --> 6714.119000000001
for more this oh dude there's been yeah

6711.92 --> 6717.119
but it's all Black Swan yeah the Black

6714.119 --> 6720.159
Swan is not it's not the photograph the

6717.119 --> 6723.639
Black Swan is the argument seeking

6720.159 --> 6729.28
starwater it's the mod modus

6723.639 --> 6729.28
Tolen argument the Carl poer

6730.159 --> 6735.638999999999
analogy it's not that one photo the one

6733.04 --> 6738.84
photo was just the first time it really

6735.639 --> 6741.0
was put down as the Black Swan the photo

6738.84 --> 6743.079
is not the Black Swan there's so many of

6741.0 --> 6744.8
these and there's been even way more

6743.079 --> 6748.0
incredible footage

6744.8 --> 6752.159000000001
like that one time it's been happening

6748.0 --> 6755.96
more like uh the infrared view from in a

6752.159 --> 6758.759999999999
plane onto the Horizon that thing is

6755.96 --> 6762.44
insane there so much

6758.76 --> 6765.599
distance that that's that's like Beyond

6762.44 --> 6767.239
black swad is just surreal seeing that

6765.599 --> 6770.599
stuff

6767.239 --> 6774.759999999999
right it's all Black Swan it's very

6770.599 --> 6777.599
simple that the globe geometry has been

6774.76 --> 6781.2390000000005
violated with all of

6777.599 --> 6783.52
it the Horizon is not geometric it's

6781.239 --> 6785.799999999999
just

6783.52 --> 6787.280000000001
Optical the higher you go the further

6785.8 --> 6790.76
you can

6787.28 --> 6793.28
see if you have the proper type of eyes

6790.76 --> 6795.639
to see at that distance right because

6793.28 --> 6798.079
regular eyes yeah you will not see it

6795.639 --> 6802.119
will be refracted more because of the

6798.079 --> 6805.5599999999995
distance because distance blurs things

6802.119 --> 6808.719
up just the distance itself the distance

6805.56 --> 6811.52
creates a limitation in your

6808.719 --> 6814.96
view

6811.52 --> 6817.96
yeah but things like infrared seems to

6814.96 --> 6823.76
like bypass a lot of the regular type of

6817.96 --> 6825.92
sight at it it makes you see extremely

6823.76 --> 6830.079000000001
far

6825.92 --> 6832.4400000000005
so yeah the Horizon is definitely not

6830.079 --> 6832.44
earth

6840.92 --> 6847.599
curve can't be that no no no no it's not

6844.159 --> 6850.638999999999
can't be it's not earth curve yeah it's

6847.599 --> 6853.639
not about oh the distance it should be

6850.639 --> 6856.2390000000005
no no there is no distance to the

6853.639 --> 6862.88
Horizon it's not earth

6856.239 --> 6867.0
curve get it there is no distance to the

6862.88 --> 6869.719
Horizon it's apparent not

6867.0 --> 6872.0
geometric the distance to the the

6869.719 --> 6877.4800000000005
apparent distance to the Horizon is

6872.0 --> 6881.32
purely dependent on the Observer and the

6877.48 --> 6883.32
conditions to observe CU there is no

6881.32 --> 6885.159
actual distance to the Horizon because

6883.32 --> 6888.36
the Earth is not a

6885.159 --> 6890.28
sphere and doesn't have a

6888.36 --> 6894.4
geometry like that

6890.28 --> 6897.96
that which would absolutely logically

6894.4 --> 6901.32
Express itself through the

6897.96 --> 6903.719
Horizon right the The Horizon would be

6901.32 --> 6905.5199999999995
geometric if the Earth was a sphere The

6903.719 --> 6908.4
Horizon is not

6905.52 --> 6910.76
geometric the geometry of the sphere has

6908.4 --> 6910.759999999999
been

6911.239 --> 6916.48
violated it's flat not a

6918.599 --> 6921.599
spere

6942.4 --> 6949.759999999999
only VI clue up holy [ __ ] well yeah when

6947.32 --> 6953.199
you look at things you kind of have have

6949.76 --> 6955.4800000000005
to include Optics now don't you yeah

6953.199 --> 6958.36
that's why you're looking at

6955.48 --> 6961.239
things yeah when you look at things you

6958.36 --> 6963.48
definitely have to include Optics akumu

6961.239 --> 6965.919999999999
definitely otherwise yeah it's kind of

6963.48 --> 6969.4
heart telling like I don't know what the

6965.92 --> 6972.639
distance of the Horizon is because I

6969.4 --> 6975.92
can't see it um yeah definitely going to

6972.639 --> 6975.92
have to include Optics

6978.52 --> 6981.52
yeah

6990.32 --> 6996.5599999999995
nobody says you should see over a way

6994.36 --> 7000.44
Hill

6996.56 --> 7000.4400000000005
what do fraction I'm

7008.48 --> 7013.638999999999
sure

7010.28 --> 7016.719
the Black Swan doesn't include

7013.639 --> 7019.639
Optics it's a modus Tolen

7016.719 --> 7023.28
argument it's a car poer analogy what do

7019.639 --> 7023.28
you talk it doesn't include

7023.48 --> 7031.0
Optics it is Optics it's an

7028.0 --> 7032.56
observation the entire premise is within

7031.0 --> 7035.079
Optics what the hell are you talking

7032.56 --> 7037.84
about it doesn't include

7035.079 --> 7040.32
Optics it does include Optics yeah it

7037.84 --> 7045.0
includes what can you see and what can't

7040.32 --> 7045.0
you see that that's like the entire

7054.76 --> 7060.8
Point way should be wet what the [ __ ]

7058.159 --> 7060.799999999999
does that even

7063.28 --> 7069.48
mean Does it include Optics yeah it does

7066.639 --> 7071.4800000000005
it takes place in Optics it literally

7069.48 --> 7073.879999999999
include Optics because that's the

7071.48 --> 7076.5199999999995
exclusive field the argument is taking

7073.88 --> 7076.52
place in

7080.599 --> 7085.079
dumbass I'd like to hear about this

7083.0 --> 7087.239
Optics you're talking about because if

7085.079 --> 7090.199
you have the go to still claim that

7087.239 --> 7093.5199999999995
terrestrial refraction is Optics you're

7090.199 --> 7096.5199999999995
going to have to prove that it is Optics

7093.52 --> 7098.320000000001
and not just a presupposed stupid piece

7096.52 --> 7101.320000000001
of math that's

7098.32 --> 7101.32
conjured

7101.76 --> 7108.679
yeah because regular Optics like the

7104.88 --> 7109.719
actual Optics actual refraction lensing

7108.679 --> 7112.1990000000005
sight

7109.719 --> 7116.4
limitation all those things yeah they're

7112.199 --> 7118.759999999999
definitely included yeah a fictional

7116.4 --> 7121.638999999999
light bending around the sphere

7118.76 --> 7124.159000000001
mathematics that is not actually proven

7121.639 --> 7127.4400000000005
with real experimentation and Optics and

7124.159 --> 7129.839999999999
physics yeah it's definitely not

7127.44 --> 7131.719
included that we Pres

7129.84 --> 7134.96
that we're looking at a sphere that is

7131.719 --> 7138.159
bent into a flat plane mysteriously yeah

7134.96 --> 7141.36
we're definitely not including those

7138.159 --> 7144.119
Optics yeah that aren't Optics it's just

7141.36 --> 7146.598999999999
conjured nonsense math that has no proof

7144.119 --> 7149.44
yes we're definitely not including that

7146.599 --> 7153.88
crap yeah we like to stick to the really

7149.44 --> 7155.5199999999995
is level like you see something because

7153.88 --> 7158.8
it's

7155.52 --> 7160.4400000000005
there not because there's an illusion

7158.8 --> 7162.119000000001
that just oh it's not really there it's

7160.44 --> 7164.04
somewhere else and then it's displaced

7162.119 --> 7167.48
in order to make it look flat yeah [ __ ]

7164.04 --> 7172.04
you man you have no evidence for that at

7167.48 --> 7174.28
all it's not based on any Optics like

7172.04 --> 7177.079
actual Optics that are like official and

7174.28 --> 7178.88
tested and provable repeatable yeah it's

7177.079 --> 7182.759999999999
not included in

7178.88 --> 7186.96
that yeah it's it's conjured math

7182.76 --> 7186.96
nonsense what you're referring to as

7188.239 --> 7191.239
Optics

7193.239 --> 7198.36
can I repeat the modus

7195.8 --> 7200.679
forumu the modus

7198.36 --> 7204.799999999999
tolin I'm not going to I'm just going to

7200.679 --> 7208.079
say it the way it is yeah if the Earth

7204.8 --> 7209.8
was a sphere of the claimed size with a

7208.079 --> 7211.32
radius that is very I'm not even going

7209.8 --> 7215.1990000000005
to name numbers [ __ ]

7211.32 --> 7216.5199999999995
it if the Earth was a sphere of the size

7215.199 --> 7221.919999999999
that the

7216.52 --> 7225.599
heliocentric Believers claim it is then

7221.92 --> 7229.0
the Horizon cannot be at a further

7225.599 --> 7231.84
distance based off a certain observation

7229.0 --> 7234.04
height right it has to be at a certain

7231.84 --> 7236.28
distance it's called a curvature

7234.04 --> 7238.04
calculated it has to be at a literal

7236.28 --> 7240.639
distance because of the geometry of the

7238.04 --> 7244.56
claimed Globe Earth you're standing

7240.639 --> 7246.159000000001
on oh we have observations in which we

7244.56 --> 7249.719
see the

7246.159 --> 7251.5199999999995
Horizon Way further than where it's

7249.719 --> 7254.119
supposed to be geometrically in

7251.52 --> 7257.639
accordance to the globe well guess what

7254.119 --> 7259.719
then it's not that geometry of the globe

7257.639 --> 7263.28
then Black

7259.719 --> 7266.8
Swamp the geometry of the globe has been

7263.28 --> 7268.36
violated visually so it's not that

7266.8 --> 7271.639
geometry

7268.36 --> 7271.639
then Black

7278.04 --> 7281.04
Swan

7283.52 --> 7289.76
right because the geometry claim of the

7286.88 --> 7291.84
glob Earth that's basically the guy in

7289.76 --> 7294.92
the car poer analogy originally that

7291.84 --> 7297.04
claimed all swans are white that's you

7294.92 --> 7299.0
that's the glober all swans are white

7297.04 --> 7300.8
look the GE The Horizon is always

7299.0 --> 7303.199
geometric it is a sphere we're standing

7300.8 --> 7304.56
on so it has to be geometric look it's

7303.199 --> 7307.199
geometric

7304.56 --> 7310.280000000001
right okay let's get a telescope then

7307.199 --> 7313.799999999999
and see if all all the swans are really

7310.28 --> 7316.48
white oh look at there yeah I I just

7313.8 --> 7318.360000000001
traveled to like another continent and

7316.48 --> 7321.32
guess what I found a Black Swan here it

7318.36 --> 7323.839999999999
is I brought it with me see it's

7321.32 --> 7325.799999999999
actually black yeah you you can check it

7323.84 --> 7327.0
out you can take a feather analyze it

7325.8 --> 7329.76
it's not

7327.0 --> 7332.4
painted this one might get babies and

7329.76 --> 7335.599
those babies will also be black black

7332.4 --> 7337.96
swans because it's actually a Black Swan

7335.599 --> 7339.76
yeah so not all swans are

7337.96 --> 7342.639
white

7339.76 --> 7346.360000000001
you were wrong Black

7342.639 --> 7348.52
Swan yeah the the geometry of Earth is

7346.36 --> 7350.88
not there because the Horizon isn't

7348.52 --> 7350.88
Earth

7351.04 --> 7360.8
curve you can see it in places that

7356.52 --> 7364.2390000000005
violate the claimed geometry of ball

7360.8 --> 7368.719
Earth so it can't be the geometry of

7364.239 --> 7371.239
ball Earth and thereby not be ball Earth

7368.719 --> 7371.2390000000005
black x

7384.84 --> 7391.360000000001
one right so guys please support

7388.0 --> 7395.04
me going to do that a

7391.36 --> 7397.199
bit I really need the support for things

7395.04 --> 7399.76
like food and all that you

7397.199 --> 7401.839999999999
know it's not a joke

7399.76 --> 7404.280000000001
if you like what I do

7401.84 --> 7407.56
here then please support me through the

7404.28 --> 7407.5599999999995
PayPal would be

7407.8 --> 7413.56
great and I'll keep doing this I'll keep

7410.4 --> 7415.32
going right I'll talk about separate

7413.56 --> 7418.88
subjects get a bit

7415.32 --> 7423.32
Fantastical and sometimes I just like go

7418.88 --> 7426.4800000000005
back to physics and faint Globe

7423.32 --> 7428.48
mechanics to dispel them but I can't

7426.48 --> 7430.48
keep doing this unless yeah I keep

7428.48 --> 7433.799999999999
getting

7430.48 --> 7435.28
fed with money that I can use to buy

7433.8 --> 7438.52
food

7435.28 --> 7442.239
so please support

7438.52 --> 7447.2390000000005
me and I'll keep this up every

7442.239 --> 7447.239
day get even better at it and better at

7448.679 --> 7452.76
it I've been at it for a

7457.8 --> 7460.8
while

7462.239 --> 7467.28
yeah Rich

7464.28 --> 7469.599
G yeah now akumu virus just very

7467.28 --> 7472.48
conveniently forced the argument to the

7469.599 --> 7474.360000000001
Black Swan so he could just roll around

7472.48 --> 7478.638999999999
in that because he was very much

7474.36 --> 7481.159
defeated over the the gas pressure

7478.639 --> 7484.28
situation and then harp saying Black

7481.159 --> 7487.92
Swan is not applicable of course to the

7484.28 --> 7490.119
gas pressure argument but hey then aumu

7487.92 --> 7492.079
is just convenient took that and started

7490.119 --> 7496.199
talking about Earth

7492.079 --> 7498.5199999999995
curve and so now I'm just breaking that

7496.199 --> 7501.0
argument by explaining the Black Swan

7498.52 --> 7501.0
it's what it

7517.52 --> 7521.280000000001
is right

7519.199 --> 7523.558999999999
so yeah please support me through the

7521.28 --> 7526.239
PayPal let me

7523.559 --> 7528.88
know I I mean I'll just check it out but

7526.239 --> 7532.5199999999995
if you just donate and tell me in the

7528.88 --> 7532.52
chat then I can thank you

7538.119 --> 7542.48
personally rather talk about gas and

7540.4 --> 7545.199
weight yeah that's cute yeah gas doesn't

7542.48 --> 7547.678999999999
have any weight it does not go down go

7545.199 --> 7550.44
boom boom it goes in all

7547.679 --> 7554.84
directions

7550.44 --> 7558.4
yeah gas in a balloon in a vacuum

7554.84 --> 7562.04
chamber goes in all directions too but

7558.4 --> 7566.04
that whole thing goes down because the

7562.04 --> 7569.04
balloon is forcing it to go down because

7566.04 --> 7570.96
it has weight especially in a vacuum

7569.04 --> 7573.159
where the

7570.96 --> 7576.04
disequilibrium of the medium which is

7573.159 --> 7578.719
going to be very low press gas with that

7576.04 --> 7581.4
solid balloon thing is going to be very

7578.719 --> 7583.88
very high so it's definitely going to go

7581.4 --> 7587.159
down the gas that's in that balloon

7583.88 --> 7589.8
thing it it just wants to go in all

7587.159 --> 7592.159
Direction it doesn't want to go down but

7589.8 --> 7595.8
guess what the balloon it is in is

7592.159 --> 7595.799999999999
forcing it to go

7598.159 --> 7606.679
down it doesn't have any extra weight

7601.84 --> 7609.2390000000005
it's not pressing harder on the scale in

7606.679 --> 7612.88
the vacuum chamber because of the gas in

7609.239 --> 7615.0
it you see the gas is not even I bet

7612.88 --> 7617.2390000000005
that the gas is literally not going to

7615.0 --> 7620.0
have any kind of pressure

7617.239 --> 7623.04
differential you could have that balloon

7620.0 --> 7626.119
completely deflated sitting on the scale

7623.04 --> 7629.4
in a vacuum it should weigh probably

7626.119 --> 7632.28
exactly the same as if the balloon were

7629.4 --> 7634.558999999999
filled with a gas sitting on the scale

7632.28 --> 7637.719
in a vacuum it should probably weigh

7634.559 --> 7640.52
exactly the same love to see that tested

7637.719 --> 7640.52
by the way

7640.8 --> 7644.599
my

7641.639 --> 7647.04
point in the end being always that yeah

7644.599 --> 7648.679
that's cute oh gas in the balloon goes

7647.04 --> 7651.719
down yeah it's because the balloon is

7648.679 --> 7653.4800000000005
going down the assas just wants to go in

7651.719 --> 7656.52
all directions it's just being dragged

7653.48 --> 7660.4
Along by the balloon cuz the balloon is

7656.52 --> 7662.96
going down in a vacuum cuz it it's

7660.4 --> 7664.598999999999
weighing more it has weight in that

7662.96 --> 7667.719
vacuum

7664.599 --> 7671.159000000001
definitely yeah in the air that weight

7667.719 --> 7673.44
is going to be countermanded by any gas

7671.159 --> 7676.759999999999
that's in the balloon that's going to

7673.44 --> 7679.839999999999
offset the average equilibrium with the

7676.76 --> 7682.88
surrounding but in a vacuum

7679.84 --> 7686.28
yeah that's just

7682.88 --> 7689.719
gone like it just wants to move in all

7686.28 --> 7691.44
directions it it yeah it just wants to

7689.719 --> 7693.2390000000005
expand in all directions but yeah the

7691.44 --> 7696.759999999999
balloon itself is

7693.239 --> 7699.919999999999
still solid okay it has to be solid has

7696.76 --> 7702.159000000001
to be strong enough to keep the gas in

7699.92 --> 7703.76
in it within a vacuum Cham has to be

7702.159 --> 7705.92
pretty damn strong it's going to have

7703.76 --> 7707.719
weight and that weight's going to pull

7705.92 --> 7711.1990000000005
the gas that's just stuck in there

7707.719 --> 7711.199
wanting to go in all directions

7711.44 --> 7719.119
down the gas is not forcing the balloon

7716.32 --> 7721.0
down in a vacuum

7719.119 --> 7724.239
chamber the

7721.0 --> 7725.199
balloon is forcing the balloon down in a

7724.239 --> 7729.678999999999
vacuum

7725.199 --> 7734.36
chamber it's just that the gas within

7729.679 --> 7739.04
it is no longer having any kind

7734.36 --> 7743.28
of like lower density influence because

7739.04 --> 7743.28
it's no longer surrounded by

7744.28 --> 7751.719
gas yeah because it's now a vacuum

7747.44 --> 7754.96
chamber when it's surrounded by gas then

7751.719 --> 7757.36
yeah it it might offset the average

7754.96 --> 7759.079
density of the balloon and the gas

7757.36 --> 7760.96
within it versus the air that surrounds

7759.079 --> 7762.96
it might even go up if that air happens

7760.96 --> 7764.96
to be helium right if the gas within the

7762.96 --> 7766.079
balloon happens to be helium then the

7764.96 --> 7768.8
average

7766.079 --> 7770.799999999999
density with the air that surrounds it

7768.8 --> 7772.2390000000005
with the balloon even though the balloon

7770.8 --> 7776.2390000000005
itself wants to go down because it's

7772.239 --> 7777.159
solid rubber yeah it might go up but in

7776.239 --> 7780.4
a

7777.159 --> 7783.839999999999
vacuum it's not going to go up because

7780.4 --> 7785.719
it's not going to be less dense than the

7783.84 --> 7788.96
average air that surrounds it the helium

7785.719 --> 7791.32
inside of it and hey the B balloon that

7788.96 --> 7792.96
it is in still wants to go down that's

7791.32 --> 7796.44
never going to change it might not go

7792.96 --> 7796.44
down if you put it in water

7796.48 --> 7805.598999999999
right but in a vacuum

7800.239 --> 7810.239
yeah the gas and balloon average as an

7805.599 --> 7812.88
object is not less dense than the air in

7810.239 --> 7812.879999999999
the chamber

7813.04 --> 7819.639
anymore because the air in the chamber

7816.159 --> 7822.679
is now gone so it has no more

7819.639 --> 7825.079
lower density so it doesn't go up

7822.679 --> 7827.52
anymore it now goes down because the

7825.079 --> 7830.679
rubber is just more dense than the

7827.52 --> 7833.400000000001
vacuum and the gas helium gas within it

7830.679 --> 7835.639
well it's not less dense than the medium

7833.4 --> 7837.719
anymore it just wants to go in all

7835.639 --> 7838.92
directions to try to fill that void that

7837.719 --> 7841.2390000000005
surrounds it

7838.92 --> 7846.0
now but the balloon is still going to

7841.239 --> 7846.0
pull it down that doesn't change in a

7847.239 --> 7850.239
vacuum

7853.119 --> 7857.839999999999
no Stevie Jarvis I never said that you

7855.52 --> 7857.84
thought

7859.88 --> 7865.559
wrong weight by the way is just pressure

7862.92 --> 7868.36
it's just measured

7865.559 --> 7870.2390000000005
pressure yeah there's no neonian weight

7868.36 --> 7873.04
Newtonian weight doesn't exist things

7870.239 --> 7874.839999999999
don't have inherent weight that are

7873.04 --> 7877.8
always

7874.84 --> 7881.360000000001
there weight is a convention based on

7877.8 --> 7884.400000000001
relative density disequilibrium pressure

7881.36 --> 7887.759999999999
prance of an object versus the medium it

7884.4 --> 7889.92
is in and that Medium should be to be

7887.76 --> 7894.599
succinct with the convention of weight

7889.92 --> 7897.639
that we use it should be in air pressure

7894.599 --> 7900.52
normal air pressure at ground level

7897.639 --> 7904.8
that's the convention of

7900.52 --> 7908.320000000001
weight that's how we have a consistent

7904.8 --> 7911.84
linear system numerological system for

7908.32 --> 7914.96
weight because of that specific Factor

7911.84 --> 7918.679
something density equilibrium dise

7914.96 --> 7920.28
equilibrium prance of pressure within a

7918.679 --> 7922.079
medium of air that's weight that's the

7920.28 --> 7924.679
convention of weight that's the actual

7922.079 --> 7924.679
thing that we

7926.119 --> 7933.639
do but

7928.32 --> 7933.639
gas doesn't press on the

7936.04 --> 7942.84
scale it's it canot do any kind of

7939.48 --> 7947.28
pressing if it is contained within an

7942.84 --> 7947.28
object and then it's more dense than the

7952.28 --> 7957.239
surrounding and yeah only while

7954.8 --> 7960.4400000000005
contained it will just add to the

7957.239 --> 7964.799999999999
average density of the

7960.44 --> 7967.839999999999
object but I mean the density of gas to

7964.8 --> 7968.559
press down in any scenario is so minimum

7967.84 --> 7970.84
that

7968.559 --> 7973.159000000001
you could basically negate it you can

7970.84 --> 7975.32
ignore it it's insignificant that's why

7973.159 --> 7977.04
I say if you put helium in a balloon in

7975.32 --> 7979.36
a vacuum and that balloon is strong

7977.04 --> 7982.32
enough like that helium is not going to

7979.36 --> 7985.679
go up it's not really going to go

7982.32 --> 7987.558999999999
down it's just going to be not really

7985.679 --> 7989.2390000000005
doing anything but want to expand in all

7987.559 --> 7991.04
directions it's not going to add to the

7989.239 --> 7992.839999999999
weight of the balloon that you're

7991.04 --> 7995.079
weighing in that vacuum chamber that's

7992.84 --> 7995.079
my

7996.96 --> 7999.96
claim

8003.4 --> 8011.719
displacing the no

8006.04 --> 8011.719
ER wow somebody's going nuts in the

8014.599 --> 8019.559
chat but I think I'm going to move

8016.52 --> 8019.559
towards rounding out the

8020.239 --> 8024.159
show are you guys enjoying

8026.96 --> 8029.96
yourselves

8034.199 --> 8039.839999999999
if you are

8035.52 --> 8039.84
please donate to my PayPal

8041.0 --> 8044.52
and help me

8049.44 --> 8054.44
out come on guys

8056.88 --> 8059.88
somebody

8070.88 --> 8074.679
address is in the description box

8086.88 --> 8089.88
below

8096.84 --> 8099.04
all

8101.119 --> 8104.119
right

8111.76 --> 8119.8
okay more physics debate not FL shut up

8115.4 --> 8119.799999999999
Kum virus is is being triggered mon

8120.199 --> 8127.719
stop stop it Earth is

8123.28 --> 8130.5199999999995
flat yeah Black Swan Horizon is not

8127.719 --> 8132.8
geometric and we did include Optics

8130.52 --> 8136.0
that's how you see the Horizon and

8132.8 --> 8138.76
terrestrial refraction bending a

8136.0 --> 8141.199
supposed presupposed sphere into a flat

8138.76 --> 8144.119000000001
plane is not a real

8141.199 --> 8146.5199999999995
thing there's no actual Optics based

8144.119 --> 8148.28
evidence for it it's never been proven

8146.52 --> 8152.559
within Optics it's never really claimed

8148.28 --> 8152.559
within Optics it's only claimed with by

8153.0 --> 8159.44
mathematicians who just conjured it put

8155.96 --> 8162.76
it in a formula to make an

8159.44 --> 8166.119
excuse terrestrial refraction is

8162.76 --> 8170.320000000001
bunk it's a mathematical claim that's

8166.119 --> 8176.28
not based in physical

8170.32 --> 8176.28
reality nor is related to Optics in any

8176.719 --> 8182.44
way Earth is flat

8180.88 --> 8187.4400000000005
measured

8182.44 --> 8190.44
calculated perceived as flat and we have

8187.44 --> 8194.119999999999
Celestial navigation worked out and

8190.44 --> 8197.519
functioning to explore the

8194.12 --> 8199.0
world because the World is Flat and

8197.519 --> 8201.359
that's why that

8199.0 --> 8204.24
works because Celestial navigation

8201.359 --> 8208.0
wouldn't work on a globe you wouldn't be

8204.24 --> 8208.8
able to get an accurate angle to any of

8208.0 --> 8211.559
the

8208.8 --> 8215.24
celestials if the

8211.559 --> 8219.759999999998
Horizon wouldn't help you attain a flat

8215.24 --> 8224.559
plane as a baseline to compare to the

8219.76 --> 8227.719000000001
angles of the stars in order to create a

8224.559 --> 8231.639
map based on the celestial

8227.719 --> 8234.719
angles so if the Earth wasn't flat we

8231.639 --> 8236.598999999998
wouldn't have been able to explore and

8234.719 --> 8241.759999999998
map

8236.599 --> 8244.359
anything because you can't get an angle

8241.76 --> 8247.479
to a curv baseline that's

8244.359 --> 8249.599
physically logically impossible no

8247.479 --> 8250.679
matter how good your computer is it's

8249.599 --> 8253.24
never

8250.679 --> 8256.359
possible it literally gives you like

8253.24 --> 8258.679
this is impossible because it is it's

8256.359 --> 8259.519
literally not possible it's paradoxical

8258.679 --> 8261.639
it's

8259.519 --> 8264.399
illogical it's never

8261.639 --> 8268.358999999999
happened Earth is flat it was measured

8264.399 --> 8272.24
flat Celestial navigation was devised of

8268.359 --> 8276.599
angles to the stars and the sun of a

8272.24 --> 8276.599
flat plane and that's why it

8276.719 --> 8281.8
works right so thanks everyone for

8279.359 --> 8283.639000000001
coming I hope you like this show if you

8281.8 --> 8286.08

the rest of the

8308.359 --> 8313.92
week

8310.92 --> 8316.92
someone thank

8313.92 --> 8319.12
you just roughly one more week and I'm

8316.92 --> 8321.2
like I'm good again for a bit and I'll

8319.12 --> 8323.439
stop complaining I just really I need to

8321.2 --> 8324.639000000001
eat especially when it's going snowing

8323.439 --> 8328.719000000001
okay come

8324.639 --> 8330.479
on H right anyhow right I'll be back

8328.719 --> 8332.039999999999
tomorrow with flat Earth early bird

8330.479 --> 8334.8
number

8332.04 --> 8336.719000000001
1837 on a

8334.8 --> 8341.24
Tuesday

8336.719 --> 8342.88
uh right make sure that you contact me

8341.24 --> 8345.199999999999
right if you want to talk to me outside

8342.88 --> 8348.719
of my live show in the chat then contact

8345.2 --> 8351.479000000001
me over Skype we can talk there outside

8348.719 --> 8354.759999999998
of the show and you can even become part

8351.479 --> 8356.599
of my flat Earth early bird Skype Group

8354.76 --> 8360.679
which I'm going to be using much more

8356.599 --> 8363.08
now which I'm going to use for posting

8360.679 --> 8365.639
links all that

8363.08 --> 8368.16
stuff and hey if like there's issues

8365.639 --> 8370.639
with my stream or something then you can

8368.16 --> 8373.319
always like say things in

8370.639 --> 8374.96
there right so it's also like a backup

8373.319 --> 8378.16
Communication

8374.96 --> 8380.358999999999
channel so yeah contact me on Skype get

8378.16 --> 8382.119999999999
in there and we can talk even outside of

8380.359 --> 8385.960000000001
the show I will answer your questions

8382.12 --> 8388.399000000001
and I'll do it at a much more easy Pace

8385.96 --> 8392.0
to your convenience not just at the

8388.399 --> 8395.199999999999
show's Pace right

8392.0 --> 8399.56
so yeah everybody have a great day and

8395.2 --> 8399.560000000001
until the next video keep it

8400.32 --> 8419.22
[Music]

8416.359 --> 8431.61
flat

8419.22 --> 8431.609999999999
[Music]

8446.319 --> 8449.319
look
