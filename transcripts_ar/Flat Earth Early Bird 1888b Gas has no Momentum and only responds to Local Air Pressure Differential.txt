4.839 --> 9.759
hello hello welcome back I don't know

8.48 --> 13.519
how that

9.759 --> 16.199
happened but uh yeah my stream just

13.519 --> 20.039
suddenly got interrupted wasn't even OBS

16.199 --> 24.64
that disconnected it just stopped very

20.039 --> 24.64
strange very very strange I don't

27.08 --> 34.079
know so but I'm back was a really good

31.56 --> 34.079
stream

41.32 --> 46.399
though thus

43.48 --> 48.718999999999994
far I have no idea why that happened

46.399 --> 48.719
very

53.44 --> 58.92
[Applause]

55.82 --> 61.92
[Music]

58.92 --> 61.92
weird

74.31 --> 79.799
[Music]

77.36 --> 85.159
I do ever stream on

79.799 --> 85.159
Rumble uh yes I did a test stream on

88.84 --> 91.84
Rumble

99.82 --> 106.32
[Music]

102.92 --> 106.32000000000001
right so yeah that was

118.84 --> 122.96000000000001
confusing

121.36 --> 125.68
yeah I don't know

122.96 --> 127.759
like yeah I could go on like another

125.68 --> 130.44
hour maybe or

127.759 --> 133.319
something another opportunity to fill in

130.44 --> 135.0
another title was a great title at the

133.319 --> 137.319
previous stream that was really weird

135.0 --> 140.56
man like I don't know what

137.319 --> 142.95899999999997
happened like o OBS didn't even give me

140.56 --> 146.04
like oh disconnected nothing it just

142.959 --> 148.72
stopped just poof

146.04 --> 151.76
stop really weird I've never had that

148.72 --> 151.76
happen before

162.92 --> 167.44
oh hey oh hey suck account yeah [ __ ]

172.4 --> 177.08
off connection no it wasn't the

174.48 --> 181.23899999999998
connection the connection was fine and

177.08 --> 183.59900000000002
OBS was fine too it just subtly cut off

181.239 --> 183.59900000000002
out of

201.28 --> 208.68
nowhere right

204.4 --> 211.68
so I hope everybody can find their way

208.68 --> 211.68
back

214.4 --> 218.59900000000002
hey Richard

215.68 --> 222.48000000000002
G did you share the link to the new

218.599 --> 222.48
stream in the old in the old

224.519 --> 229.959
chat hit the Rogan yeah please also

227.439 --> 232.2
everybody here please go back to the

229.959 --> 236.0
previous video and hit that one up I

232.2 --> 236.0
really want want

238.68 --> 241.68
that

254.48 --> 258.84
in order to

256.079 --> 260.639
open uh you did

258.84 --> 264.35999999999996
it

260.639 --> 264.36
how you don't have a

268.6 --> 271.6
wrench

279.6 --> 285.639
done it again okay

283.08 --> 287.8
fine if you guys could just say hey

285.639 --> 291.759
there's a new stream in

287.8 --> 295.72
there get over here and don't forget to

291.759 --> 295.72
Rogan up the previous

297.12 --> 302.96
stream and then yeah we can just

300.16 --> 306.47900000000004
basically use this one to talk a little

302.96 --> 306.479
longer and then round it

307.24 --> 312.24
out kind of weird that this happened I

309.6 --> 314.68
mean that's a great show thus far I mean

312.24 --> 314.68
I had a

321.479 --> 326.0
blast it's dead for you okay

328.479 --> 331.479
fine

364.83 --> 368.03999999999996
[Music]

370.0 --> 374.039
right it got eight Rogan up already

371.759 --> 374.039
that's

388.4 --> 391.4
good

391.56 --> 396.12
all right I'm downloading it just in

393.199 --> 400.28000000000003
case there's something weird going on

396.12 --> 400.28000000000003
that was just a great show went really

412.08 --> 418.4
well a creat Dragon Ball D

416.199 --> 421.40000000000003
oh

418.4 --> 421.4
okay

434.44 --> 440.68
hey blue pill Evolution good to see

437.24 --> 446.08
you cor helicopter just went over no

440.68 --> 451.319
Coralis deviation H maybe his cor Corola

446.08 --> 451.31899999999996
corrector device was activated hilarious

456.599 --> 459.599
Victor

463.319 --> 466.319
right

471.599 --> 476.319
H yeah you have no right to laugh over

474.199 --> 478.039
that akumu virus it's part of your

476.319 --> 482.319
stupid ass claim

478.039 --> 482.31899999999996
so just shut up and be

502.65 --> 505.84999999999997
[Music]

508.24 --> 511.24
silent

538.2 --> 541.2
for

550.04 --> 552.959
ring off the

553.8 --> 559.0
China it would be noticeable yes of

556.56 --> 562.2399999999999
course it would be noticeable I

559.0 --> 565.279
mean if a helicopter would be suspended

562.24 --> 567.44
in the air which they

565.279 --> 571.68
are and the Earth would be turning

567.44 --> 575.5600000000001
underneath then yeah that would be

571.68 --> 577.959
happening turkey building arms I don't

575.56 --> 581.8
know I don't

577.959 --> 583.7199999999999
know there are like lots of things going

581.8 --> 586.68
around about that here we go again I

583.72 --> 589.2
don't know the details but Europe is

586.68 --> 593.0
trying a war economy or that kind of

589.2 --> 595.839
nonsense it's it's all idiotic what

593.0 --> 600.079
Europe is doing is like just

595.839 --> 603.24
self-destructing on purpose in many ways

600.079 --> 607.279
like they're trying to disown the

603.24 --> 609.76
farmers from their lands they're cutting

607.279 --> 612.92
off resources

609.76 --> 614.64
they're applying crazy environmental

612.92 --> 617.3199999999999
policies that just make everything

614.64 --> 619.92
tougher it's just like they're trying to

617.32 --> 623.0790000000001
squeeze everybody really hard really

619.92 --> 626.24
painfully destroy industry and like

623.079 --> 630.4799999999999
force some kind of War economy it's it's

626.24 --> 633.36
terrible terrible what's going on and

630.48 --> 635.639
it's not going to end well one way or

633.36 --> 638.6
the other it's not going to end well the

635.639 --> 641.92
Earth doesn't turn very fast

638.6 --> 645.639
yeah yeah but doesn't really matter how

641.92 --> 645.639
fast or slow it turns

648.36 --> 654.12
though it will turn underneath any air

652.6 --> 657.0
that would have to be contained by the

654.12 --> 660.9590000000001
way so almost saying like oh it should

657.0 --> 663.519
be doing this like yeah but

660.959 --> 665.2399999999999
no because it's claimed to be an open

663.519 --> 667.32
system next to a vacuum and there

665.24 --> 669.399
wouldn't be any air sticking to the

667.32 --> 671.839
Earth in order for the earth to be

669.399 --> 673.8
turning underneath it so it's just it's

671.839 --> 677.0
so

673.8 --> 679.56
convoluted Globe Earth is so

677.0 --> 683.639
unbelievably

679.56 --> 685.7199999999999
convoluted the claims just never like

683.639 --> 689.519
the

685.72 --> 691.8000000000001
breaking of Reality by the globe claims

689.519 --> 691.8
Never

715.079 --> 722.4399999999999
End how much you think really should

719.0 --> 724.279
would make something deviate something

722.44 --> 728.2790000000001
something and

724.279 --> 730.92
consistently yeah cuz

728.279 --> 733.32
coris it's the Earth that's deviating

730.92 --> 736.7199999999999
not the air you

733.32 --> 740.36
see Earth is spinning not the

736.72 --> 744.639
air so whatever suspended in that

740.36 --> 747.04
air it should be drifting anything and

744.639 --> 749.16
at all time yeah not just oh it's

747.04 --> 751.199
drifting now oh that other day yeah it

749.16 --> 753.3199999999999
wasn't drifting yeah it's always

751.199 --> 755.56
drifting unless you want to claim that

753.32 --> 757.8000000000001
the Earth just stops spinning

755.56 --> 760.5999999999999
underneath I don't think that that is

757.8 --> 760.5999999999999
part of the globe

761.279 --> 765.56
claim you thought everything moved as

763.8 --> 768.68
one yeah doesn't work though Ben

765.56 --> 772.16
Johnston because air is not susceptible

768.68 --> 774.199
to momentum it it doesn't have momentum

772.16 --> 775.6
it just responds to local air pressure

774.199 --> 777.5999999999999
differential it's like oh there's a

775.6 --> 780.24
little pressure more than right next to

777.6 --> 784.32
it well then it's going to displace

780.24 --> 789.519
it yeah but it doesn't have momentum you

784.32 --> 793.6800000000001
can't throw air and then it keeps going

789.519 --> 796.519
yeah that's why when you throw a rock

793.68 --> 800.04
it'll keep flying as soon as just you

796.519 --> 803.04
let it go in your throw same goes for a

800.04 --> 805.76
water balloon you let it go it keeps

803.04 --> 807.4399999999999
flying right but if that balloon is

805.76 --> 810.76
filled with

807.44 --> 814.0400000000001
air it's not going to keep going it's

810.76 --> 819.48
going to go o and then just

814.04 --> 821.8
like stop the momentum stops why because

819.48 --> 823.8000000000001
air doesn't have momentum it only

821.8 --> 828.04
responds to local air pressure

823.8 --> 833.4399999999999
differential so air can't build momentum

828.04 --> 836.4399999999999
in motion it doesn't do that no gases do

833.44 --> 840.12
that it all just

836.44 --> 843.24
stops and evens out the pressures with

840.12 --> 846.639
its surrounding gas the gas that

843.24 --> 849.199
surrounds it that's what gas and air

846.639 --> 851.44
does it doesn't have momentum you can't

849.199 --> 853.24
throw air and then it keeps flying on no

851.44 --> 854.839
it doesn't do that it just immediately

853.24 --> 858.92
evens out with the pressure that

854.839 --> 858.9200000000001
surrounds it so it

859.079 --> 867.519
stops yeah the only way you could make

862.759 --> 871.759
gas or air move continually with an

867.519 --> 874.6
object if is if it is the

871.759 --> 876.1990000000001
container that is moving and pushing

874.6 --> 880.8000000000001
forth the

876.199 --> 883.12
air right so in theoretical ball Earth

880.8 --> 886.56
spinning there would have to

883.12 --> 891.399
be flat segments

886.56 --> 893.199
walls that push the air forth as the

891.399 --> 897.36
Earth is supposedly spinning and that

893.199 --> 900.3599999999999
would be the only way that the air would

897.36 --> 902.6800000000001
move in some some form of lock step with

900.36 --> 905.44
the spinning Earth but that's of course

902.68 --> 907.68
not the case so the air isn't going to

905.44 --> 910.0400000000001
move in lock step with the Earth because

907.68 --> 912.959
there's nothing physically pushing it

910.04 --> 915.519
forth and without something pushing

912.959 --> 918.6389999999999
continually pushing it forth continually

915.519 --> 920.36
creating that air pressure differential

918.639 --> 924.04
a pressure differential that will just

920.36 --> 926.48
keep migrating keep making it move it's

924.04 --> 931.56
going to stand still and the Earth will

926.48 --> 931.5600000000001
spin underneath it cuz air doesn't have

936.16 --> 943.68
momentum hey look who just went

940.959 --> 946.1199999999999
live somebody mentioned about Dell not

943.68 --> 949.279
being there for while he just went live

946.12 --> 949.279
not that I really care

951.759 --> 958.16
but is looping Earth still yeah Earth is

956.199 --> 960.5999999999999
stationary whatever it is it's

958.16 --> 960.6
stationary

969.44 --> 978.2790000000001
friction the Earth

972.8 --> 978.279
no it doesn't have friction it's it's a

981.48 --> 990.9590000000001
gas like gas is doesn't have friction it

987.199 --> 992.959
just yeah it might at the ground level

990.959 --> 995.04
theoretically spinning earth like some

992.959 --> 999.2399999999999
trees might like push forth a little bit

995.04 --> 1001.5999999999999
of air but then as soon as that barrier

999.24 --> 1003.839
that pushes it forth stops like the top

1001.6 --> 1005.88
of the tree yeah above that it's just

1003.839 --> 1008.0790000000001
going to immediately the tree is going

1005.88 --> 1010.92
to keep moving forward and the

1008.079 --> 1013.279
gas is going to stand still yeah that's

1010.92 --> 1017.4399999999999
what would

1013.279 --> 1017.4399999999999
happen so no not

1017.48 --> 1020.48
friction

1021.27 --> 1026.339
[Music]

1042.12 --> 1047.3999999999999
idiots if ER didn't have friction shaing

1044.76 --> 1050.28
ship wouldn't work why

1047.4 --> 1053.2800000000002
not that's

1050.28 --> 1056.2
ridiculous that's air pressure

1053.28 --> 1060.36
differential yeah that's not

1056.2 --> 1063.24
friction things may experience friction

1060.36 --> 1065.8799999999999
going through air because it literally

1063.24 --> 1068.96
through its motion through the air

1065.88 --> 1071.7990000000002
pushes the air forth creating higher

1068.96 --> 1075.559
pressure and that air pressure that is

1071.799 --> 1079.12
local then equally presses back a bit

1075.559 --> 1081.36
that's why you have friction

1079.12 --> 1085.039
from the air by moving through it and

1081.36 --> 1085.039
pushing against it

1086.08 --> 1096.12
yeah that only works if there is a

1090.76 --> 1096.12
physical surface involved

1102.679 --> 1109.96
yes so their air does have

1105.919 --> 1113.0
friction yeah it you can create friction

1109.96 --> 1114.919
by pushing through air physically

1113.0 --> 1118.84
pushing through

1114.919 --> 1120.5200000000002
it like falling through it for example

1118.84 --> 1122.799
then you have air

1120.52 --> 1125.76
friction because there's a physical

1122.799 --> 1128.4
thing pushing against the air creating

1125.76 --> 1131.12
higher pressure differential that then

1128.4 --> 1133.3600000000001
locally presses back a bit slows you

1131.12 --> 1134.84
down that's why you get terminal

1133.36 --> 1138.36
velocity

1134.84 --> 1141.76
yeah but it doesn't mean it has momentum

1138.36 --> 1144.36
every consecutive little piece of air is

1141.76 --> 1147.2
going to push and then move around you

1144.36 --> 1149.799
and then equalize where it was

1147.2 --> 1152.44
leaving where you left it you move

1149.799 --> 1156.6399999999999
through it that air doesn't keep moving

1152.44 --> 1159.76
with you it stays behind yeah every

1156.64 --> 1161.96
place something moves through another

1159.76 --> 1164.6
new local pressure differential is

1161.96 --> 1165.88
created by the push with the air that is

1164.6 --> 1168.36
there and then as soon as you move

1165.88 --> 1172.4
through that it equalizes again and

1168.36 --> 1174.039
stays where you left it yeah the Air

1172.4 --> 1177.0
does not have

1174.039 --> 1180.24
momentum that's what this is

1177.0 --> 1183.159
about yes s are physical that's right so

1180.24 --> 1185.64
you're not making an

1183.159 --> 1189.5590000000002
argument this is

1185.64 --> 1189.5590000000002
stupid you're really

1194.4 --> 1203.159
dumb

1196.48 --> 1203.159
yeah friction is not the same thing as

1209.84 --> 1217.1999999999998
momentum momentum means it keeps moving

1213.919 --> 1220.039
even if nothing pushes against it it

1217.2 --> 1220.039
doesn't do

1222.08 --> 1226.6789999999999
that but if something pushes against it

1225.0 --> 1228.84
yeah it may move yeah that's called

1226.679 --> 1231.6000000000001
friction yeah

1228.84 --> 1233.08
but it doesn't then continue moving if

1231.6 --> 1237.52
the pushing

1233.08 --> 1239.3999999999999
stops that's the point not that oh that

1237.52 --> 1243.32
means gas doesn't have FR I mean

1239.4 --> 1246.48
seriously like did you ever do school

1243.32 --> 1248.3999999999999
this is like you learn this at 12 in

1246.48 --> 1250.96
school with physics are you this

1248.4 --> 1250.96
freaking

1251.32 --> 1255.84
dumb I'm not talking about friction I'm

1254.28 --> 1258.12
talking about

1255.84 --> 1260.1999999999998
momentum without momentum when would

1258.12 --> 1261.559
wouldn't push that's ridiculous that's

1260.2 --> 1263.0800000000002
just a false

1261.559 --> 1267.8799999999999
statement

1263.08 --> 1267.8799999999999
false the body of air

1267.919 --> 1272.039
pushes anything in the way will be

1270.64 --> 1275.279
pushed

1272.039 --> 1277.4
against yeah because the hole is pushing

1275.279 --> 1280.88
it doesn't have momentum it's not like

1277.4 --> 1284.1200000000001
oh the pushing stops well the air keeps

1280.88 --> 1286.72
pushing then no it doesn't only solids

1284.12 --> 1289.9599999999998
and liquids do that only they have

1286.72 --> 1293.64
momentum will keep pushing in even when

1289.96 --> 1295.96
they're not being pushed forth yeah gas

1293.64 --> 1297.4
just seeks an equilibrium with the local

1295.96 --> 1299.919
air pressure

1297.4 --> 1303.76
differential and if there isn't any it

1299.919 --> 1305.96
will keep on redistributing expanding

1303.76 --> 1308.48
keep pushing forth any physical thing

1305.96 --> 1312.2
getting caught up in that will be pushed

1308.48 --> 1315.2
Along by the air it's because there is a

1312.2 --> 1317.3600000000001
continual non-stop pushing there is a

1315.2 --> 1320.32
force from the pushing that keeps

1317.36 --> 1322.279
happening it's not because it has

1320.32 --> 1325.52
momentum the pushing stopped and it

1322.279 --> 1328.76
keeps going because gas and air doesn't

1325.52 --> 1330.48
do that it only responds to local air

1328.76 --> 1332.679
pressure differential and when there is

1330.48 --> 1336.3600000000001
some and something physical is caught up

1332.679 --> 1339.799
in that then it will be pushed around by

1336.36 --> 1342.52
it and if something falls through the

1339.799 --> 1344.84
air it will also where it it goes

1342.52 --> 1346.559
through it push against that air

1344.84 --> 1348.76
creating a little bit more pressure

1346.559 --> 1353.3999999999999
differential which then caus the

1348.76 --> 1356.24
friction yeah but this has nothing to do

1353.4 --> 1358.72
with gas supposedly having momentum it

1356.24 --> 1361.039
doesn't it never does if you believe

1358.72 --> 1365.159
that you're [ __ ]

1361.039 --> 1367.12
demented an idiot you would fail basic

1905.08 --> 1912.1589999999999
point if you keep shoving it

1908.24 --> 1912.159

1916.0 --> 1922.679
out get gas has no

momentum physics

1922.679 --> 1928.44
fact when you stop pushing against it it

1926.36 --> 1932.039
equalizes with its environment and it

1928.44 --> 1934.679
does not continue to

who could just like get a grip and just

2268.319 --> 2273.48
shut the hell up when these subjects

2270.04 --> 2275.599
come up so that is not freaking

2273.48 --> 2280.56
bickering an hour about

2275.599 --> 2283.599
it but he just doesn't stop he has no

2280.56 --> 2285.88
self-control when the ballart Devil

2283.599 --> 2285.88
comes

2285.96 --> 2289.88
out and I don't want to deal with it

2288.0 --> 2292.76
anymore it's not worth it it's not worth

2289.88 --> 2296.04
it to have him around with other

2292.76 --> 2301.3590000000004
subjects because of this

2296.04 --> 2305.599
[ __ ] cuz then I'd find myself avoiding

2301.359 --> 2308.119
Flat Earth subjects because otherwise it

2305.599 --> 2312.079
had to deal with those [ __ ] demons

2308.119 --> 2312.079
again I don't want to deal with them

2323.96 --> 2329.119
anymore right I'm going to take two

2325.839 --> 2329.119
minute break I'll be right

2335.52 --> 2338.52
back

2365.44 --> 2368.44
e

2395.4 --> 2398.4
e

2441.079 --> 2447.52
weather is exquisite here no rain on the

2444.28 --> 2450.6800000000003
10 day

2447.52 --> 2454.44
nice yeah the weather here is

2450.68 --> 2455.9199999999996
me it's sort of clouded no no rain

2454.44 --> 2458.319
though even though that was predicted

2455.92 --> 2458.319
let me show

2459.92 --> 2466.839
you just looks kind of

2463.28 --> 2468.079
hazy and oh yeah that may be bit of a

2466.839 --> 2471.0
cloud

2468.079 --> 2474.44
bank it's more visible on the webcam

2471.0 --> 2474.44
than with the naked eye weirdly

2475.079 --> 2479.04
enough that kind of looks like a

2479.72 --> 2484.64
trail also not super visible with the

2482.48 --> 2487.48
naked eye it's weird usually it's the

2484.64 --> 2489.48
other way around usually the webcam

2487.48 --> 2493.0
doesn't pick up what I can see with the

2489.48 --> 2496.0
naked eye not the other way around

2493.0 --> 2496.0
huh

2496.16 --> 2502.839
strange sometimes I just don't

2499.44 --> 2504.599
understand why why it looks so different

2502.839 --> 2506.599
when I look with my eyes and look

2504.599 --> 2509.52
through the camera I don't get that it's

2506.599 --> 2512.599
very weird then again you

2509.52 --> 2515.24
know says the celestial lights

2512.599 --> 2516.76
being the

2515.24 --> 2519.4799999999996
unique

2516.76 --> 2522.3190000000004
holographic effect that it is that we

2519.48 --> 2525.079
cannot make yeah by the way I had a

2522.319 --> 2527.68
whole conversation yesterday you think

2525.079 --> 2530.04
what you know what chemicals there why

2527.68 --> 2532.359
are you assuming they're chemicals Ben

2530.04 --> 2535.72
Johnson why are you assuming

2532.359 --> 2537.72
that I don't assume that I mean they

2535.72 --> 2541.5589999999997
could be spraying

2537.72 --> 2544.0789999999997
something but why would it be

2541.559 --> 2547.3590000000004
chemicals like what is the actual proof

2544.079 --> 2550.44
you have for that other than a

2547.359 --> 2554.16
reference in a paper somewhere or a

2550.44 --> 2557.28
sample that was taken in in the late

2554.16 --> 2559.48
9s in a very specific location like I

2557.28 --> 2562.119
don't have proof that it is actual

2559.48 --> 2562.119
chemicals they're

2562.559 --> 2567.3590000000004
spraying it's certainly not water vapor

2565.48 --> 2570.079
because that wouldn't persist that would

2567.359 --> 2571.7599999999998
evaporate very

2570.079 --> 2575.6400000000003
quickly

2571.76 --> 2577.0
contrails so it could be dust some kind

2575.64 --> 2581.04
when they do

2577.0 --> 2584.24
that but you don't know what it

2581.04 --> 2587.92
is yeah you re yeah I know that's what

2584.24 --> 2589.64
they say aluminum dioxide barium salts

2587.92 --> 2591.2000000000003
that's what they always say because that

2589.64 --> 2595.64
was part of

2591.2 --> 2598.5989999999997
a a program at some point but how do we

2595.64 --> 2601.64
know that that is what they always do

2598.599 --> 2606.1600000000003
yeah wouldn't they at some point kind of

2601.64 --> 2609.8799999999997
run out I mean it's it's literally thir

2606.16 --> 2613.92
30 years 30 years of spraying

2609.88 --> 2616.28
stuff like in the entire Western world

2613.92 --> 2620.2000000000003
like how where are they getting all that

2616.28 --> 2623.599
stuff from wouldn't they just run

2620.2 --> 2627.04
out it makes no sense to me I think

2623.599 --> 2628.2400000000002
personally I have no proof to back it I

2627.04 --> 2631.319
think it would have been a lot more

2628.24 --> 2632.24
logical if they basically just sprayed

2631.319 --> 2633.92
like

2632.24 --> 2637.5989999999997
colloidal

2633.92 --> 2639.2000000000003
sand like they just take sand dust and

2637.599 --> 2641.2400000000002
spray

2639.2 --> 2643.7599999999998
that

2641.24 --> 2646.3999999999996
right 50 years in your

2643.76 --> 2649.7200000000003
opin no but they here we go again they

2646.4 --> 2652.2000000000003
may have experimented 50 years ago but

2649.72 --> 2656.5989999999997
like the actual

2652.2 --> 2660.04
noticeable chem program like officially

2656.599 --> 2663.119
started in 95 worldwide that's when

2660.04 --> 2666.4
suddenly that became a more daily

2663.119 --> 2669.1600000000003
occurrence before that it was just a

2666.4 --> 2671.559
rare test here and

2669.16 --> 2672.5989999999997
there depends on the temperature no it

2671.559 --> 2674.92
does

2672.599 --> 2676.88
not it does not depend on the

2674.92 --> 2679.64
temperature at

2676.88 --> 2682.6400000000003
all has nothing to do with

2679.64 --> 2682.64
it

2683.04 --> 2692.04
yeah water droplets not not evaporating

2688.68 --> 2694.96
are not going to hang there like ice

2692.04 --> 2697.079
crystals and feather out through the

2694.96 --> 2700.48
wind that's not

2697.079 --> 2704.2000000000003
possible they will dissolve like they

2700.48 --> 2707.2
will like directly go from ice crystals

2704.2 --> 2707.2
to

2707.68 --> 2712.96
moist to water vapor that's what

2710.44 --> 2717.64
actually happens it can't

2712.96 --> 2722.48
respond like solids do that just move

2717.64 --> 2724.52
around like a feather typical site that

2722.48 --> 2727.319
water vapor can't do that under any

2724.52 --> 2730.7599999999998
condition any temperature it doesn't

2727.319 --> 2733.92
happen that is a

2730.76 --> 2737.2000000000003
myth it's definitely something other

2733.92 --> 2742.0
than water vapor that persists the

2737.2 --> 2742.0
persistent Trails not water vapor that's

2743.559 --> 2749.4
impossible

2745.079 --> 2749.4
right but uh what was I talking

2754.88 --> 2758.2400000000002
about yeah I guess that's what we're

2757.079 --> 2760.2400000000002
talking

2758.24 --> 2763.24
about I thought I was going to say

2760.24 --> 2766.9599999999996
something but then this came

2763.24 --> 2771.2799999999997
up is it in the

2766.96 --> 2773.119
fuel no probably not I mean if you put

2771.28 --> 2777.559
that stuff in the fuel it's going to

2773.119 --> 2777.559
freaking damage the engines like no

2779.96 --> 2787.4
way that's what's clouds

2783.28 --> 2791.2000000000003
do clouds are watered

2787.4 --> 2793.359
droplets they don't form at that

2791.2 --> 2795.5589999999997
height and by the way they're water

2793.359 --> 2797.48
droplets that are sticking this is

2795.559 --> 2800.76
official yeah it's not just water

2797.48 --> 2804.96
droplets it's water droplets that are

2800.76 --> 2809.0400000000004
entangled with a bit of dust dust fine

2804.96 --> 2812.16
sand anything a solid

2809.04 --> 2814.16
particle yeah that's what a cloud is

2812.16 --> 2817.92
it's not just water droplets no it's

2814.16 --> 2820.3999999999996
water droplets that are hanging on solid

2817.92 --> 2822.8
particles that are suspended and that

2820.4 --> 2825.319
keeps them in the droplet state without

2822.8 --> 2830.3590000000004
the solid particles yeah it's not going

2825.319 --> 2833.68
to be able to form a cloud it would

2830.359 --> 2837.72
evaporate yeah that's what why it is

2833.68 --> 2843.72
called cloud seeding you drop solid

2837.72 --> 2846.68
particles for the moist to latch onto

2843.72 --> 2848.839
that's the whole point

2846.68 --> 2851.7999999999997
that's the entire point of

2848.839 --> 2854.96
geoengineering and and cloud

2851.8 --> 2854.96
seeding get

2863.64 --> 2870.0
it front bar yeah but here we go again

2867.44 --> 2873.079
that's what they said that's what they

2870.0 --> 2875.72
said it might have been part of the

2873.079 --> 2878.319
tests but I also think that that

2875.72 --> 2882.48
combination of

2878.319 --> 2886.319
uh stuff was specifically designed for a

2882.48 --> 2889.2
conjuncted project for testing

2886.319 --> 2892.04
harp and like

2889.2 --> 2894.839
uh

2892.04 --> 2897.04
optimizing like uh

2894.839 --> 2899.4
telecommunication right so that that

2897.04 --> 2901.319
specific set of

2899.4 --> 2904.0
chemicals

2901.319 --> 2907.319
was basically designed to have this

2904.0 --> 2909.24
multi-purpose function

2907.319 --> 2911.4
I don't think that that's what they what

2909.24 --> 2914.4399999999996
they're

2911.4 --> 2918.64
doing also because if you just keep

2914.44 --> 2921.4
spraying that particular combination of

2918.64 --> 2926.24
metals for 30

2921.4 --> 2929.28
years dude that has like really really

2926.24 --> 2932.4799999999996
measurable impact on the environment

2929.28 --> 2936.6800000000003
like we would like see

2932.48 --> 2939.68
just forests dying everywhere

2936.68 --> 2942.2
like it would not be undone it would

2939.68 --> 2946.3999999999996
just like the soil would become

2942.2 --> 2948.5589999999997
nonviable for life there's no way that

2946.4 --> 2950.799
that's been happening exactly like that

2948.559 --> 2953.28
for 30 years there would be no more

2950.799 --> 2955.28
forests around

2953.28 --> 2956.3190000000004
now I don't think that that's what

2955.28 --> 2960.3190000000004
they're

2956.319 --> 2963.72
doing it couldn't be like we wouldn't

2960.319 --> 2965.92
have nature left if that was the case

2963.72 --> 2968.359
that was even speculated that was like

2965.92 --> 2970.76
one of the fears back then from these

2968.359 --> 2972.2
chemtrail conspiracy theorists that said

2970.76 --> 2974.599
no this is what they do it's going to

2972.2 --> 2977.48
kill everything why are they doing it

2974.599 --> 2980.76
well it's 30 years later now and there's

2977.48 --> 2984.52
still stuff alive it's still

2980.76 --> 2986.6800000000003
living we can still grow food on soil

2984.52 --> 2986.68
you

2987.799 --> 2995.16
know Hawai is struggling because of the

2991.24 --> 2997.24
pH uh I don't know that's an island in

2995.16 --> 3003.16
the middle of of nowhere and they just

2997.24 --> 3006.68
got yeah they got dwed and all that so

3003.16 --> 3008.2
whatever I don't know Hawai is just one

3006.68 --> 3011.799
very small

3008.2 --> 3014.3999999999996
place yeah well the geoengineering

3011.799 --> 3017.0
program which is kind of official that's

3014.4 --> 3022.359
been around everywhere in the

3017.0 --> 3024.96
west and we're still being able to grow

3022.359 --> 3027.44
crops and they're still living forests

3024.96 --> 3031.0
that are doing just fine

3027.44 --> 3033.0
so it just seems very illogical that

3031.0 --> 3035.4
that it's literally those chemicals that

3033.0 --> 3036.39
have always been sprayed for 30 years

3035.4 --> 3039.699
just

3036.39 --> 3039.699
[Music]

3040.319 --> 3047.2799999999997
no okay Deb that's

3043.72 --> 3050.5989999999997
weird but uh yeah there are things that

3047.28 --> 3054.799
are being sprayed but I mean do they

3050.599 --> 3056.92
know what those chem drills really are

3054.799 --> 3060.48
right do do they

3056.92 --> 3063.64
know like did they ever like hey let's

3060.48 --> 3066.599
take a tank with us like from the spray

3063.64 --> 3070.0
area and then like oh let's open it and

3066.599 --> 3073.2400000000002
do some chemical analysis right has

3070.0 --> 3076.319
anybody here ever seen that has anybody

3073.24 --> 3076.319
ever actually done

3076.88 --> 3082.2000000000003
that

3078.839 --> 3085.04
right you're just assuming it's those

3082.2 --> 3085.5699999999997
chemicals what if it's just colloidal

3085.04 --> 3088.52
silic

3085.57 --> 3091.4
[Music]

3088.52 --> 3097.92
right which would not be harmful but it

3091.4 --> 3097.92
would serve as a particle for cloud

3104.2 --> 3108.24
seeding Spain has suffered for yeah but

3106.839 --> 3110.92
here we go again Spain has always

3108.24 --> 3114.9599999999996
suffered through drought that's not

3110.92 --> 3118.0
new like that happened in the 80s even

3114.96 --> 3120.04
Spain is a very hot and dry country

3118.0 --> 3122.559
especially Inland that's just always

3120.04 --> 3122.5589999999997
been like

3128.64 --> 3133.799
that the well pumps ring up salinated

3134.64 --> 3140.839
water right but I mean Spain could do

3137.92 --> 3142.96
with some elaborate cloud seeding

3140.839 --> 3144.92
although it's also an issue is like

3142.96 --> 3147.28
where do they actually get the water

3144.92 --> 3147.28
from

3147.44 --> 3152.48
if you want to do cloud seeding there

3149.16 --> 3156.24
has to be the moist around in order to

3152.48 --> 3158.839
for it to form Cloud so where how

3156.24 --> 3162.5989999999997
right that's a bit of the

3158.839 --> 3166.24
issue but I mean yeah like I am

3162.599 --> 3168.92
technically not against weather

3166.24 --> 3171.8799999999997
modification I'm only against it if it

3168.92 --> 3175.0
is like a long-term poisonous influence

3171.88 --> 3177.359
that am I very against but I'm like yeah

3175.0 --> 3179.359
weather modification geoengineering in

3177.359 --> 3182.0
that sense like make the weather more

3179.359 --> 3185.04
optimal here and there and there in a

3182.0 --> 3187.0
responsible way like don't just take all

3185.04 --> 3191.92
the good weather from one country and

3187.0 --> 3194.64
steal it for yours right that's not nice

3191.92 --> 3198.2000000000003
that's well that would be potentially

3194.64 --> 3201.48
like a declaration of war I

3198.2 --> 3207.0789999999997
mean it should

3201.48 --> 3209.68
be dealt with and properly

3207.079 --> 3212.44
what do you say yeah adapted it should

3209.68 --> 3214.799
be just considered as like just as we're

3212.44 --> 3216.88
dealing with oh we have to deal with AI

3214.799 --> 3218.96
now it's there what do we do with it is

3216.88 --> 3221.92
it dangerous how do we build rules with

3218.96 --> 3224.96
it should we like yeah GE

3221.92 --> 3227.319
engineering uh you could just like keep

3224.96 --> 3228.839
denying it exists and then somebody just

3227.319 --> 3232.5589999999997
does it and nobody knows what they're

3228.839 --> 3235.5589999999997
exactly doing which is not a good idea

3232.559 --> 3237.6400000000003
at all or we could like declassify and

3235.559 --> 3241.8390000000004
like okay let's actually

3237.64 --> 3244.48
get proper weather modification rules

3241.839 --> 3247.48
International rules with it and

3244.48 --> 3250.0
integrate it like so that people can

3247.48 --> 3251.72
vote on it Etc so that it could be

3250.0 --> 3252.88
treated in government and just

3251.72 --> 3255.52
officially

3252.88 --> 3257.44
declassify right but of course those

3255.52 --> 3258.799
that have that are doing it don't want

3257.44 --> 3261.28
to give away their

3258.799 --> 3264.839
power which by the way happens to also

3261.28 --> 3268.76
be Bill Gates which is crazy idea that

3264.839 --> 3271.0789999999997
that guy has like a leadership role in

3268.76 --> 3274.3590000000004
like the world Geo geoengineering

3271.079 --> 3278.2400000000002
program like who the

3274.359 --> 3280.2
hell the who the [ __ ] arranged that

3278.24 --> 3283.7599999999998
[Music]

3280.2 --> 3286.0
Madness so

3283.76 --> 3288.7200000000003
crazy but uh

3286.0 --> 3290.839
yeah I mean declassify weather

3288.72 --> 3296.3999999999996
modification and just get it properly

3290.839 --> 3300.68
integrated just use it right I mean we

3296.4 --> 3303.319
transport soil or fertilizer from other

3300.68 --> 3306.16
countries to modify the soil and get

3303.319 --> 3308.64
production right that's a modification

3306.16 --> 3311.5989999999997
so why not do the same thing with the

3308.64 --> 3316.359
weather if you can in an efficient and

3311.599 --> 3316.3590000000004
non-toxic way that only makes

3323.68 --> 3329.9199999999996
sense parts of Spain drown each year so

3327.599 --> 3332.52
so for

3329.92 --> 3334.16
right they're trying to yeah could be it

3332.52 --> 3336.52
could be that they're on purpose just

3334.16 --> 3339.7599999999998
trying to ruin

3336.52 --> 3344.2
it because of the secrecy here we go

3339.76 --> 3347.3190000000004
again they can abuse it but if it was

3344.2 --> 3348.4399999999996
Declassified then there could be control

3347.319 --> 3351.64
there could

3348.44 --> 3353.76
be knowledge about hey they're actually

3351.64 --> 3355.799
trying to ruin it there's something to

3353.76 --> 3359.079
point at

3355.799 --> 3362.72
right and I bet that Spain could like

3359.079 --> 3366.2000000000003
completely turn it around and have Parts

3362.72 --> 3370.799
not be flooded and the other parts not

3366.2 --> 3370.799
get droughts but just evenly

3378.4 --> 3383.1600000000003
distributed makes sense unless they are

3381.039 --> 3386.48
looking to use it as a weapon yeah well

3383.16 --> 3388.44
it seems like they are and definit like

3386.48 --> 3390.68
especially in the United States it's

3388.44 --> 3395.2000000000003
like very apparent that they have been

3390.68 --> 3395.2
using weather alterations like

3395.799 --> 3402.2
Weaponry like in during tornado

3399.48 --> 3404.48
season it's like hey the pathways of

3402.2 --> 3407.5589999999997
these things oh wow suddenly out of

3404.48 --> 3409.76
nowhere some weird electrical phenomenon

3407.559 --> 3413.079
that's just not natural and suddenly

3409.76 --> 3417.5200000000004
they get even stronger that kind that's

3413.079 --> 3417.52
weaponized weather modification like

3421.64 --> 3427.68
blatantly don't be surprised if you die

3424.559 --> 3431.52
DW what why do you think

3427.68 --> 3431.52
that just get a blue

3431.72 --> 3436.2
hat just make sure you always have a

3434.039 --> 3439.6400000000003
blue hat with you in a

3436.2 --> 3442.5589999999997
bag or even better a blue burka it's not

3439.64 --> 3445.44
even a joke it sounds really

3442.559 --> 3448.039
ridiculous have a blue

3445.44 --> 3450.319
burka that you can have in a in a fanny

3448.039 --> 3452.6800000000003
pack or something or in your backpack

3450.319 --> 3455.0389999999998
just have it with you and then it's like

3452.68 --> 3458.319
whoa what the hell is that like that

3455.039 --> 3461.88
does not like whoa [ __ ] are they DW it

3458.319 --> 3463.839
quickly get the blue Burk out over your

3461.88 --> 3466.0
head and you you can then technically

3463.839 --> 3469.599
even walk through that

3466.0 --> 3471.68
zone without anything

3469.599 --> 3473.799
happening I'm going to paint the roof

3471.68 --> 3476.72
blue for sure that would

3473.799 --> 3479.64
help

3476.72 --> 3481.5589999999997
blue yeah it's a thing I mean they've

3479.64 --> 3484.5589999999997
even been doing that in

3481.559 --> 3486.48
Chile that people might not be all too

3484.559 --> 3487.8390000000004
aware of it's really escaped the news

3486.48 --> 3492.0
but in

3487.839 --> 3494.64
Chile after the whole Hawai Hawaii

3492.0 --> 3499.359
situation which was very much in the

3494.64 --> 3503.2
news like sh Chile also had that very

3499.359 --> 3505.48
recently I think this year even pretty

3503.2 --> 3507.52
freaky and they're like painting

3505.48 --> 3510.48
everything all the roofs blue now

3507.52 --> 3513.88
because they just know like

3510.48 --> 3516.96
that's that's the weird like DW laser

3513.88 --> 3520.079
attack so if we just paint it blue then

3516.96 --> 3520.079
we get to keep our

3533.72 --> 3536.72
houses

3538.76 --> 3543.6800000000003
blue stops lasers yeah apparently it

3540.92 --> 3545.92
does I mean there's all videos all over

3543.68 --> 3545.9199999999996
the

3549.52 --> 3554.92
place I'm not a specialist but I mean

3552.24 --> 3557.24
there's been plenty of videos that

3554.92 --> 3559.319
especially in why they filmed afterward

3557.24 --> 3561.9199999999996
you get all these molten cars and all

3559.319 --> 3565.48
that but then there's

3561.92 --> 3568.799
like a blue handbag or with in a blue

3565.48 --> 3572.76
plastic bag and it's like in between

3568.799 --> 3574.16
molten [ __ ] like burned molten rock

3572.76 --> 3576.079
everything's completely torched it's

3574.16 --> 3578.799
just like the bag's just sitting there

3576.079 --> 3582.2000000000003
why because it's that very specific blue

3578.799 --> 3583.599
it's very weird I know but it's real

3582.2 --> 3586.52
that's really

3583.599 --> 3588.079
happening and there are theorists that

3586.52 --> 3589.359
say oh that's because of a certain type

3588.079 --> 3592.799
of

3589.359 --> 3596.0389999999998
laser that that burns anything except

3592.799 --> 3598.24
that color yeah umbrellas bins Etc all

3596.039 --> 3599.7990000000004
that yeah that's real it's very strange

3598.24 --> 3602.799
but it's

3599.799 --> 3606.119
real like during the whole situation

3602.799 --> 3607.72
with Hawaii when that happened it was

3606.119 --> 3610.6400000000003
all over the

3607.72 --> 3612.16
Internet what shade of blue is best it's

3610.64 --> 3616.319
this

3612.16 --> 3616.319
typical Marine light

3621.4 --> 3625.48
bluish kind of the color of the the

3623.96 --> 3630.7200000000003
moderator

3625.48 --> 3630.72
font right that blue light

3653.52 --> 3656.52
blue

3683.44 --> 3686.44
yeah

3711.48 --> 3717.72
I don't know Eric do want more com way

3727.359 --> 3732.48
what did you figure it

3730.2 --> 3734.799
out like this is as far as I'm going to

3732.48 --> 3734.799
go with

3743.359 --> 3746.359
it

3780.16 --> 3782.96
yeah I'm getting kind of

3803.279 --> 3806.279
hungry

3825.36 --> 3828.659
[Music]

3833.279 --> 3836.279
for

3852.319 --> 3856.4
right

3853.279 --> 3858.68
so nobody forget the Rogan up the show

3856.4 --> 3858.6800000000003
by the

3860.52 --> 3867.0389999999998
way it's kind of weird that the previous

3863.68 --> 3871.799
show like even though went on for almost

3867.039 --> 3871.7990000000004
3 hours have so little views that's very

3881.2 --> 3889.359
odd although it'll probably build up

3885.4 --> 3891.119
more it's very low for an hour ago

3889.359 --> 3893.16
should be now whatever it doesn't really

3891.119 --> 3896.1600000000003
matter it was a good

3893.16 --> 3896.16
show

3897.68 --> 3904.359
and this one is also decent two

3901.44 --> 3906.599
subjects gas has no

3904.359 --> 3913.4
momentum

3906.599 --> 3913.4
and yeah the ew stuff and Geo weather

3914.76 --> 3921.039
modification

3917.44 --> 3921.039
what what are you talking

3923.079 --> 3926.079
about

3937.72 --> 3946.319
on your screen it says 324 videos

3942.079 --> 3949.3590000000004
what on the on the first half video and

3946.319 --> 3952.7599999999998
Johnson are you are you

3949.359 --> 3955.0389999999998
sure now that's the fall of wizard

3952.76 --> 3956.8390000000004
counil I think

3955.039 --> 3957.96
that's from the stream from yes I'm

3956.839 --> 3961.839
talking

3957.96 --> 3964.119
about those possessed by ball lie devils

3961.839 --> 3965.319
and [ __ ] correction that one the

3964.119 --> 3968.6800000000003
previous

3965.319 --> 3968.68
half on

3977.92 --> 3985.799
here it says 97 views

3981.559 --> 3988.799
here now it's back to 27

3985.799 --> 3988.799
what

3989.279 --> 3995.039
what the on the stream that's going

3992.079 --> 3997.7200000000003
right now it says 26 but that's like the

3995.039 --> 4001.7200000000003
live Watchers I wasn't talking about

3997.72 --> 4003.0789999999997
that last video is doing well I guess

4001.72 --> 4007.8799999999997
it's at

4003.079 --> 4007.88
97 it's not super great

4008.16 --> 4013.0
but anyway don't forget to rogans up

4011.76 --> 4017.6400000000003
this

4013.0 --> 4019.799
video it's at 4 it should be at at least

4017.64 --> 4019.799
at

4021.359 --> 4028.2
8 even though a lot of people are not

4025.24 --> 4031.3999999999996
they did go maybe that's why that is

4028.2 --> 4033.7599999999998
maybe that's just cut cut off

4031.4 --> 4036.2000000000003
because the video had just too many

4033.76 --> 4039.48
people in the chat they don't want that

4036.2 --> 4042.9199999999996
whoever they are the day those

4039.48 --> 4045.92
people the dickory

4042.92 --> 4045.92
doooo

4046.079 --> 4049.0
m in yeah

4052.88 --> 4057.079
thanks Ben

4054.68 --> 4060.5989999999997
Johnston I really appreciate your

4057.079 --> 4063.48
presence unlike the other obvious fake

4060.599 --> 4066.039
act idiot you seem to be a genuine

4063.48 --> 4068.279
person I'm really happy having you here

4066.039 --> 4070.6800000000003
so yeah please keep sticking with it

4068.279 --> 4075.92
you're a real asset thus far I'm very

4070.68 --> 4075.9199999999996
happy to have met you at Owen Benjamin's

4100.159 --> 4105.44
pull over pull over it's a

4102.4 --> 4109.0
cardigan right

4105.44 --> 4111.879999999999
man that's an old

4109.0 --> 4113.199
joke Dumb and Dumber that movie was so

4111.88 --> 4116.08
stupid

4113.199 --> 4118.759
really like it was super popular and

4116.08 --> 4121.44
funny when it came out and I enjoyed it

4118.759 --> 4123.56
but then like 10 years later I watched

4121.44 --> 4127.2789999999995
it again it's like Jesus Christ this

4123.56 --> 4129.04
movie is lame like it's actually lame

4127.279 --> 4132.080000000001
there's funny things about it but it's

4129.04 --> 4132.08
also just really

4132.799 --> 4139.96
lame weird weird how it was so super

4136.799 --> 4139.96
popular when it just came

4158.799 --> 4165.56
out

4161.359 --> 4169.359
Del who knows debatable D why the hell

4165.56 --> 4169.359
would you assume that she knows

4176.0 --> 4180.239
that okay apparently she

4191.839 --> 4195.84
does right so I think all together is

4194.36 --> 4199.679
this

4195.84 --> 4203.07
already again a 4our

4199.679 --> 4205.36
stream no wait 3 and a

4203.07 --> 4207.799999999999
[Music]

4205.36 --> 4209.4
half but I'm G to reach the four again

4207.8 --> 4213.0
oh my God am I gonna like have a

4209.4 --> 4215.48
freaking 4our show every day now like a

4213.0 --> 4215.48
crazy

4216.12 --> 4219.44
person but at least it's kind of

4218.239 --> 4221.4
interesting

4219.44 --> 4225.639999999999
right I mean I'm not going to do a

4221.4 --> 4225.639999999999
4-Hour show if like nothing happens

4231.679 --> 4238.32
and we keep swinging from subject to

4234.08 --> 4238.32
subject space lasers

4240.52 --> 4245.8
no laser

4243.719 --> 4249.52
satellite well technically you could

4245.8 --> 4251.96
have like laser satell loons though but

4249.52 --> 4256.280000000001
I mean would you really like Risk having

4251.96 --> 4256.28
a laser suspended by a balloon like

4257.8 --> 4261.4400000000005
that seems kind of

4263.88 --> 4268.08
risky like I'd rather like use a

4266.719 --> 4271.199
zeppelin or

4268.08 --> 4273.239
something because when you like put them

4271.199 --> 4275.199
up there it's not like you can get them

4273.239 --> 4278.5199999999995
down again in a controlled fashion you

4275.199 --> 4280.4
know so any kind of laser like that I

4278.52 --> 4282.96
would rather put it on a

4280.4 --> 4286.0
zappelin and then you could like get the

4282.96 --> 4288.199
sappin go down again for like

4286.0 --> 4291.48
maintenance or replacement or whatever

4288.199 --> 4295.96
and then send it back up you know but a

4291.48 --> 4299.0
Seton is like once you send it up there

4295.96 --> 4303.36
it's going to be up there until it comes

4299.0 --> 4306.4
down and then yeah there's likelihood

4303.36 --> 4308.639
that it'll get lost or it will break and

4306.4 --> 4312.159
it's like a onetime

4308.639 --> 4312.159000000001
thing with sat

4312.56 --> 4315.56
Loom

4323.52 --> 4326.52
aircrafts

4327.76 --> 4331.0
yeah that

4336.44 --> 4341.239
too like they could definitely be

4342.48 --> 4345.48
involved

4354.239 --> 4359.0
on the other hand those types of

4355.44 --> 4362.199
aircraft are kind of problematic

4359.0 --> 4364.32
because you want them to be Out Of Reach

4362.199 --> 4366.199
like what if you just have those

4364.32 --> 4369.04
aircraft do

4366.199 --> 4372.44
that what if they get shot down now

4369.04 --> 4374.12
suddenly the opponent has like that

4372.44 --> 4375.599999999999
weapon

4374.12 --> 4378.159
like they know what you're doing they

4375.6 --> 4381.8
could like back engineer it and like do

4378.159 --> 4384.96
the same thing yeah you're

4381.8 --> 4387.679
screwed but if you like have them like

4384.96 --> 4390.76
high up too high up

4387.679 --> 4394.719
then I don't

4390.76 --> 4394.719
know maybe it's not really an

4402.36 --> 4405.36
issue

4408.12 --> 4412.76
de why would why should we know

4415.08 --> 4423.4
that why this why that because because

4419.48 --> 4427.959999999999
that get it why are you assuming that we

4423.4 --> 4427.96
would know it's just the way it

4432.36 --> 4435.36
is

4464.36 --> 4468.719
if the sun BS the paint and change of

4466.6 --> 4471.320000000001
the you well then it wouldn't work

4468.719 --> 4475.04
anymore or only partially and then

4471.32 --> 4479.04
eventually still torch I don't

4475.04 --> 4481.88
know why are you assuming I'd know

4479.04 --> 4484.4
that why don't you just go ask an actual

4481.88 --> 4486.92
paint specialist who like knows about

4484.4 --> 4490.199
those things instead of a guy that will

4486.92 --> 4490.1990000000005
talk about anything on

4492.28 --> 4495.28
YouTube

4508.639 --> 4514.12
regular repainting yeah or just using

4512.48 --> 4516.879999999999
certain types of

4514.12 --> 4520.0
elements like certain types of stuff in

4516.88 --> 4522.1990000000005
the paint that literally just W

4520.0 --> 4525.199
decolorize because of

4522.199 --> 4525.199
sunlight

4527.12 --> 4530.8
why are you bringing that up duper why

4529.36 --> 4534.28
why why are you bringing that up all of

4530.8 --> 4534.28
a sudden why

4552.199 --> 4555.199
now

4555.56 --> 4560.2390000000005
