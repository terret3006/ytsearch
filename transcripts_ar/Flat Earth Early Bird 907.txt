38.7 --> 41.36
foreign

51.5 --> 57.78
welcome to Flat Earth early bird number

54.32 --> 59.64
907 I'm your host Arwin and before we

57.78 --> 61.859
start the show please don't forget to

59.64 --> 64.14
share it on any platform you deem fit

61.859 --> 65.7
and if you haven't already subscribe to

64.14 --> 68.34
my channel and hit the Bell notification

65.7 --> 70.2
so you know when I'm going live which is

68.34 --> 72.36
normally 1pm Amsterdam time in the

70.2 --> 74.82000000000001
weekdays and 2PM Amsterdam time in the

72.36 --> 76.979
weekend and please also do support me

74.82 --> 78.41999999999999
through the PayPal patreon crypto wallet

76.979 --> 80.28
Super Chat and the membership system

78.42 --> 82.74000000000001
join button that will be much

80.28 --> 87.18
appreciated

82.74 --> 90.119
so weather made quite a turnaround

87.18 --> 92.46000000000001
as today it's

90.119 --> 94.32
not windy

92.46 --> 96.29899999999999
really clear

94.32 --> 101.53999999999999
just a couple of clouds here and there

96.299 --> 101.54
but like nice warm not windy

103.439 --> 107.39899999999999
sound carries very far because of the

105.72 --> 110.939
low wind setting

107.399 --> 114.92
so yes birds from everywhere you can

110.939 --> 114.91999999999999
hear them at a distance much better

116.64 --> 122.96000000000001
just do yeah

118.5 --> 122.96
kind of like a decent summer day

130.14 --> 139.73899999999998
so

132.739 --> 139.739
it's Friday the 28th of May 2021

139.8 --> 147.44
and John

141.62 --> 147.44
925 yes your first welcome to chat

149.099 --> 151.94
huh

152.239 --> 158.81900000000002
right so

154.519 --> 161.16
yesterday for me it was basically not a

158.819 --> 165.83999999999997
very good day because I was

161.16 --> 169.739
in pain a lot of it

165.84 --> 172.379
I even had like semi feverish

169.739 --> 174.92000000000002
moments

172.379 --> 177.89999999999998
so yeah

174.92 --> 181.55999999999997
people could already tell from the show

177.9 --> 184.31900000000002
and that I rounded out early and I was I

181.56 --> 186.48
basically barely spoke up maybe two

184.319 --> 189.29999999999998
times in the entire flutter the baits

186.48 --> 192.79999999999998
although at the end because it did last

189.3 --> 192.8
very long the live show

193.019 --> 199.5
Nathan gave an extra like a double

196.319 --> 201.29999999999998
Hour episode to compensate for

199.5 --> 203.22
the day before

201.3 --> 205.86
when there wasn't a show

203.22 --> 208.26
and he was at it

205.86 --> 210.36
it was

208.26 --> 213.72
yeah classic Nathan

210.36 --> 215.87900000000002
it was totally on to this bowler

213.72 --> 219.42
I was just trying to

215.879 --> 221.94
keep straw Manning and

219.42 --> 224.159
being extremely elusive

221.94 --> 226.019
deep trench your level

224.159 --> 227.34
so yeah classic flight Earth debates

226.019 --> 230.459
yesterday

227.34 --> 233.22
but yeah I was in pain a lot of it so I

230.459 --> 235.799
I couldn't even muster

233.22 --> 239.28
at me doing getting in there and being

235.799 --> 241.739
all Baldwin like that and maybe I'm

239.28 --> 245.519
probably the guys are relieved that I

241.739 --> 247.56
don't do that every single time because

245.519 --> 249.659
I'm a force to be reckoned with and

247.56 --> 252.439
Globe one glow wind should not be

249.659 --> 252.439
underestimated

252.599 --> 258.0
ah

254.879 --> 261.139
but yeah I put the word to the D the D

258.0 --> 261.139
to the word I mean

261.419 --> 264.74
come to bed quite early

267.6 --> 274.259
yeah half past 12.

270.72 --> 276.41900000000004
and yeah took a shower warm shower

274.259 --> 281.28000000000003
pretty long before that

276.419 --> 283.5
and yeah I think it did a lot of good I

281.28 --> 285.59999999999997
wasn't as painful as last night although

283.5 --> 286.8
I had a few moments where it was pretty

285.6 --> 289.58000000000004
damn it

286.8 --> 289.58
painful

290.699 --> 295.82
it's just that the overall strain seems

293.28 --> 295.82
a little less

297.12 --> 301.259
and yeah hope to do a little better

299.52 --> 304.32
today

301.259 --> 306.96000000000004
but yeah it's still there

304.32 --> 308.759
but I have kind of like

306.96 --> 310.039
a lot of the

308.759 --> 312.84000000000003
let's say

310.039 --> 316.82
biochemical load seems to be off because

312.84 --> 316.82
of it I had a really good night rest

318.479 --> 322.86
I weirdly enough I think this sounds

321.18 --> 325.56
really weird

322.86 --> 328.56
it is correlative but I think that maybe

325.56 --> 330.84
like having that cheese what is it now

328.56 --> 331.979
two days ago might have also somehow

330.84 --> 334.79999999999995
triggered it

331.979 --> 339.36
something in there probably contributed

334.8 --> 341.94
for my body to engage with this process

339.36 --> 344.46000000000004
it feels like it but it could be purely

341.94 --> 346.8
coincidental

344.46 --> 348.0
so I haven't eaten cheese since then

346.8 --> 350.639
it's

348.0 --> 354.259
it really stood out to me how how bad

350.639 --> 354.259
that fell when I took that

355.259 --> 361.08000000000004
right

356.639 --> 364.34000000000003
I watched oh Benjamin last stream

361.08 --> 364.34
from the day before then

364.8 --> 369.6
shoot

366.84 --> 375.02
it was pretty awesome

369.6 --> 375.02000000000004
uh and right now before this show

376.979 --> 383.34
I watched Martin Lucas from yesterday

379.68 --> 385.5
which was also quite exhilarating

383.34 --> 388.28
had another guy on

385.5 --> 388.28
with him

393.06 --> 397.919
yeah talking about everything

395.78 --> 400.19899999999996
yeah it's good it makes me kind of

397.919 --> 404.35999999999996
jealous I even commented

400.199 --> 404.36
on Martin late because hang out

405.12 --> 412.319
like man it's it's great to have these

409.139 --> 414.86
conversations and I wish I could be part

412.319 --> 414.86
of that too

416.28 --> 418.46
foreign

421.46 --> 428.12
chat or is it just John 9

425.099 --> 428.12
2 5.

429.479 --> 432.62
anybody out there

452.099 --> 454.699
hello

471.78 --> 478.21999999999997
huh hey psychics Traveler

475.02 --> 478.21999999999997
long time no see

484.979 --> 489.08
how are you doing how have you been

486.9 --> 489.08
doing

507.66 --> 510.66
foreign

520.14 --> 523.8199999999999
is anybody out there

527.279 --> 532.68
anybody would like to talk about

529.32 --> 534.6800000000001
anything it's Friday you know

532.68 --> 538.6999999999999
should be a great day

534.68 --> 538.6999999999999
and the weather is quite beautiful

540.06 --> 545.5799999999999
oh yeah the little

542.7 --> 547.5600000000001
weird thing I think that

545.58 --> 550.86
the baby from

547.56 --> 554.3389999999999
the magpies like in the big mess over

550.86 --> 556.6800000000001
there I think some got into an accident

554.339 --> 557.6400000000001
I think they got entangled with some

556.68 --> 559.3199999999999
fluff

557.64 --> 562.3199999999999
and

559.32 --> 564.839
broke something or fell out of the nest

562.32 --> 568.74
because I found its corpse

564.839 --> 571.399
like on the roof so it was put there and

568.74 --> 574.38
yeah I think I overlooked it earlier

571.399 --> 576.54
didn't see it probably because of the

574.38 --> 578.899
bad weather more focused on up there and

576.54 --> 578.899
all that

579.12 --> 587.88
but it's been dead for a while

582.18 --> 591.0
I'd say yeah a couple of days to a week

587.88 --> 592.4399999999999
that was kind of weird finding that

591.0 --> 595.26
poor thing

592.44 --> 598.1600000000001
well this house goes in nature not all

595.26 --> 598.16
of it survives

598.2 --> 603.9590000000001
the jackdaws though they're doing just

601.5 --> 606.959
fine I think that the babies probably

603.959 --> 608.959
already like our teenagers or something

606.959 --> 612.7199999999999
they're not so

608.959 --> 617.1199999999999
scratchy anymore they're more

612.72 --> 617.12
more birdie sounding so

618.92 --> 622.8199999999999
Gary wibanga

627.839 --> 634.1400000000001
all right all right so I'm gonna try T

631.86 --> 636.42
again

634.14 --> 638.9399999999999
yesterday it didn't really have a good

636.42 --> 643.2199999999999
effect so

638.94 --> 643.22
let's just try very carefully see

644.519 --> 649.74
if it does that again

647.399 --> 652.94
might purely be the temperature so I'm

649.74 --> 652.94
gonna dilute it down some

655.44 --> 658.0400000000001
foreign

681.48 --> 687.0
right so

683.88 --> 689.779
speak up people I appreciate you saying

687.0 --> 689.779
hello in chat

690.0 --> 696.06
Show's been going for

692.339 --> 699.4200000000001
11 minutes now I'd like to

696.06 --> 701.04
get into a conversation again

699.42 --> 702.66
right

701.04 --> 705.079
that's when the show really gets

702.66 --> 705.079
interesting

714.959 --> 720.899
and if if any of you have any

717.779 --> 724.82
Reflections on what I've talked about

720.899 --> 724.82
I'd like to hear about it

726.72 --> 729.2
right

730.38 --> 736.519
sometimes I'm a little disappointed at

732.6 --> 736.519
how sparing the comments are

737.579 --> 743.3389999999999
but maybe it's just because it takes

740.339 --> 746.399
more time for some people

743.339 --> 749.12
to get a grip on what I'm talking about

746.399 --> 749.12
could be

756.42 --> 760.4399999999999
a steamy traveler always brings good

758.519 --> 764.24
questions

760.44 --> 764.24
I don't think he's here right now

784.019 --> 786.68
hmm

798.72 --> 801.44
well

809.579 --> 814.62
okay people

811.2 --> 816.9200000000001
this is starting to really piss me off

814.62 --> 816.92
now

818.7 --> 821.24
okay

821.339 --> 825.3000000000001
can you please just

823.68 --> 827.88
get in here

825.3 --> 829.56
let's have a conversation because in the

827.88 --> 832.4399999999999
meantime

829.56 --> 836.6389999999999
yeah the tension is actually causing me

832.44 --> 839.5790000000001
anguish here literally physically

836.639 --> 841.6800000000001
when I'm like this yeah look if you if

839.579 --> 843.779
you guys are just

841.68 --> 845.699
gonna advise me like hey why don't you

843.779 --> 848.519
just don't do a show until it gets

845.699 --> 850.68
better fine I'll do that but

848.519 --> 854.1
I have gone through this sort of thing

850.68 --> 856.38
before even during shows and hey if

854.1 --> 859.5600000000001
there's plenty of activity

856.38 --> 862.62
then I'll do just fine people are only

859.56 --> 866.04
just gonna stare and listen and not

862.62 --> 868.139
interact then it's a real tough job for

866.04 --> 871.98
me to continue doing this so can I

868.139 --> 875.66
please have some interaction in chat

871.98 --> 875.66
besides saying hello

887.05 --> 891.9799999999999
[Music]

888.48 --> 891.98
and where are the guys

892.08 --> 904.26
[Applause]

901.82 --> 906.779
maybe I should just freaking link the

904.26 --> 908.88
show to everybody I don't even do that

906.779 --> 911.06
like Nathan does constantly I'll just do

908.88 --> 915.39
that

911.06 --> 915.39
[Applause]

922.46 --> 926.88
[Music]

924.839 --> 929.0600000000001
hello super straight earther good to see

926.88 --> 929.06
you

943.98 --> 946.98
foreign

968.06 --> 972.0
gloped hard to still think so-called

970.199 --> 975.5999999999999
gravity affects gas

972.0 --> 977.639
well super straight Arthur it does

975.6 --> 981.0
pretty supposedly

977.639 --> 983.639
it's just that it doesn't keep gas to a

981.0 --> 987.72
ball or to a specific location in the

983.639 --> 990.12
face of a vacuous volume right that's

987.72 --> 992.94
that's the issue like the standard

990.12 --> 995.639
idea of gravity all those they don't

992.94 --> 998.1600000000001
account for that they really don't

995.639 --> 1000.62
so if you were to balance out that

998.16 --> 1003.5
equation as Baldwin has attempted

1000.62 --> 1006.62
sparsely getting through the rumpusing

1003.5 --> 1009.279
of the flat earther side when I actually

1006.62 --> 1009.279
attempt it

1010.339 --> 1016.639
right you have to resort to fictional

1013.639 --> 1018.8
mediums like bending of space-time in

1016.639 --> 1021.44
order to account for a mysterious

1018.8 --> 1022.7589999999999
influence that would allow that to

1021.44 --> 1024.919
happen

1022.759 --> 1028.039
you could say the bending of space-time

1024.919 --> 1032.419
provides a container

1028.039 --> 1033.559
or a container effect

1032.419 --> 1036.699
right

1033.559 --> 1036.699
that's an example

1038.059 --> 1042.5
wait you think gravity affects get well

1040.52 --> 1044.12
yes buoyancy of course it doesn't

1042.5 --> 1046.66
prevent it from going in all directions

1044.12 --> 1046.6599999999999
though

1046.819 --> 1053.02
right so gravity effectively is a

1050.179 --> 1053.02
construct

1053.419 --> 1058.88
that suggests there is more to relative

1056.96 --> 1061.7
density that's really just what it is

1058.88 --> 1065.179
right relative density is gravity

1061.7 --> 1067.5800000000002
like that's what gravity does it's just

1065.179 --> 1070.539
that there's more suggestions and

1067.58 --> 1070.539
geometry

1070.88 --> 1074.2600000000002
things on top of it

1078.559 --> 1083.799
right so yeah the confusion is endless

1080.78 --> 1086.8999999999999
right and there's a bit of like a

1083.799 --> 1090.08
accidental perhaps straw man motion

1086.9 --> 1092.539
happening from the flat earth side

1090.08 --> 1095.1999999999998
you say like gravity doesn't affect gas

1092.539 --> 1098.24
no that's not entirely true look

1095.2 --> 1101.78
Newtonian mechanics

1098.24 --> 1103.46
don't ha they don't account like the

1101.78 --> 1106.34
force make it don't account for gases

1103.46 --> 1109.76
that's specific to Newtonian mechanics

1106.34 --> 1113.6
but gravitation which he laid no claim

1109.76 --> 1116.419
to but was later used is theories that

1113.6 --> 1119.78
he didn't like scientific claim to were

1116.419 --> 1123.5
later used for a conception of gravity

1119.78 --> 1126.32
which surpassed Newtonian mechanics

1123.5 --> 1130.16
effectively so they did kind of account

1126.32 --> 1135.26
for gas they just didn't account for it

1130.16 --> 1138.98
yeah Facing a Giant volume of vacuous

1135.26 --> 1140.48
space right that's that's the specific

1138.98 --> 1143.96
issue

1140.48 --> 1147.16
but gas yeah gas would have to go down

1143.96 --> 1149.9
go boom boom in order to virtually

1147.16 --> 1151.1000000000001
clumsily imagine how it could stick to

1149.9 --> 1153.5
the ball

1151.1 --> 1156.6999999999998
right but that's not actually what

1153.5 --> 1156.7
gravity is supposed to do

1157.039 --> 1160.84
because it just has buoyancy

1162.08 --> 1168.32
do you believe Einstein is no well

1166.16 --> 1171.26
believe that does it really matter

1168.32 --> 1173.36
because you can't prove it it's in a

1171.26 --> 1176.26
fictional medium

1173.36 --> 1176.26
conceptual

1184.34 --> 1189.26
right

1186.26 --> 1192.08
is this an actual Flat Earth stream yeah

1189.26 --> 1196.7
no [ __ ] Mo Amadeus

1192.08 --> 1198.6789999999999
uh been doing hello episode 907

1196.7 --> 1201.1000000000001
been doing this for a couple of years

1198.679 --> 1201.1000000000001
now

1201.98 --> 1209.44
did I watch jetolin media distance to

1205.58 --> 1209.4399999999998
the sun no I haven't interesting

1210.02 --> 1217.34
hey Tara 306 that finally chats

1214.22 --> 1221.44
get is finally going

1217.34 --> 1221.4399999999998
why is space flat what

1226.82 --> 1230.1399999999999
there is no gravity

1231.2 --> 1237.38
well there's relative density

1234.559 --> 1241.1
and gravity is really the science

1237.38 --> 1243.7990000000002
fiction cover story

1241.1 --> 1246.039
on top of relative density that's the

1243.799 --> 1246.039
trick

1251.659 --> 1256.46
okay Jay told in Media

1253.58 --> 1258.799
I'm not subscribed to his channel

1256.46 --> 1262.48
look guys I'm subscribed I'm not

1258.799 --> 1262.48
subscribed to a whole bunch of people

1263.72 --> 1269.74
maybe never got to it

1266.659 --> 1269.74
checking him out

1271.13 --> 1276.4
[Music]

1273.799 --> 1276.4
hmm

1278.6 --> 1284.84
distance decoding they have and solar

1281.299 --> 1288.1399999999999
distance well that's from is that

1284.84 --> 1293.799
that's from three weeks ago hmm

1288.14 --> 1293.7990000000002
okay I'll take a quick look at it

1309.38 --> 1314.3200000000002
that's 30 38 minutes long

1314.539 --> 1320.0
all right I'll link you up anybody

1316.7 --> 1322.159
because it is interesting

1320.0 --> 1324.62
could you give me a summary of what was

1322.159 --> 1326.72
in it is he making any claims to an

1324.62 --> 1329.799
actual distance and does he do it

1326.72 --> 1329.799
through triangulation

1334.58 --> 1341.1399999999999
does the column of gas create gas

1337.94 --> 1341.14
pressure yes it does

1343.76 --> 1349.82
but the actual real gas pressure

1346.82 --> 1352.1589999999999
how the the force mechanics of the

1349.82 --> 1354.9189999999999
expansion and all that work

1352.159 --> 1356.5390000000002
what it really does is it pushes against

1354.919 --> 1359.659
the container

1356.539 --> 1361.76
right through all the other gas it

1359.659 --> 1364.7
pushes against all gas which pushes

1361.76 --> 1366.32
against all other gas and its

1364.7 --> 1367.5800000000002
surrounding which would have to be the

1366.32 --> 1368.72
container if there's no container

1367.58 --> 1371.0
pushing back

1368.72 --> 1373.64
then you couldn't measure any gas

1371.0 --> 1375.62
pressure for even the fleeting moment it

1373.64 --> 1378.679
was there because it would only be just

1375.62 --> 1382.539
expanding in all directions

1378.679 --> 1385.3400000000001
so even the pressure from gas

1382.539 --> 1386.78
is there is stable because it's all

1385.34 --> 1389.78
pressing

1386.78 --> 1391.22
all of it against the container and even

1389.78 --> 1393.98
if you

1391.22 --> 1397.64
create a rocket or something

1393.98 --> 1399.98
to create all kinds of pressure to lift

1397.64 --> 1404.0590000000002
the the rocket

1399.98 --> 1407.0
right even that pressure only works

1404.059 --> 1408.74
because it presses against the gas which

1407.0 --> 1410.96
presses against all other gas which

1408.74 --> 1413.86
presses against the container that's

1410.96 --> 1413.8600000000001
some some new

1414.02 --> 1420.74
clear laid out trainer thinking that I

1418.22 --> 1423.74
basically have created

1420.74 --> 1425.84
for yeah for a few to understand how

1423.74 --> 1428.0
that works how the Mechanics Work

1425.84 --> 1431.74
kind of proud of that came up with that

1428.0 --> 1431.74
was it two weeks ago

1432.5 --> 1435.94
are you seeking star water

1439.94 --> 1443.679
containers know it they do

1444.08 --> 1447.279
they do push back

1449.0 --> 1451.9
that's the point

1476.48 --> 1483.7
right okay super straight Arthur okay

1479.659 --> 1486.4
well yeah great parallax

1483.7 --> 1489.7
foreign

1486.4 --> 1489.7
ulation again

1494.72 --> 1501.26
seems like Foley to me like really so oh

1498.2 --> 1504.38
it's that distance well

1501.26 --> 1505.94
can we see an approach Factor right 4

1504.38 --> 1508.5800000000002
000 miles

1505.94 --> 1511.7
yeah start ground level go in that

1508.58 --> 1515.3799999999999
direction oh does it actually stay the

1511.7 --> 1515.38
same direction as you ascend

1515.84 --> 1519.799
or does something else happen does it

1518.48 --> 1522.38
actually Bend away

1519.799 --> 1524.24
and also like is there an angular size

1522.38 --> 1526.7600000000002
change over that distance right the

1524.24 --> 1530.539
closer you presuppose based on some kind

1526.76 --> 1532.1
of triangulation process the sun is to

1530.539 --> 1535.64
the Flat Earth

1532.1 --> 1537.1399999999999
well the more you would have to

1535.64 --> 1539.96
yeah

1537.14 --> 1542.8400000000001
you would spot

1539.96 --> 1546.26
perspective based size changes

1542.84 --> 1549.82
right angular size change because of an

1546.26 --> 1549.82
approach to something physical

1553.159 --> 1557.659
hey yeah seeking star water I'm doing

1555.26 --> 1560.179
okay better than yesterday I'm still a

1557.659 --> 1562.7
bit aching

1560.179 --> 1563.779
but I had a good night rest so that

1562.7 --> 1566.8400000000001
helped a lot

1563.779 --> 1570.22
I'm gonna take it easy

1566.84 --> 1570.22
probably this whole weekend

1570.86 --> 1577.34
it's not all about Parallax okay Effie

1574.34 --> 1577.34
Kaepernick

1585.5 --> 1591.159
in the flat closet

1587.36 --> 1591.1589999999999
hmm Maybe

1627.32 --> 1637.22
ah

1628.59 --> 1637.22
[Music]

1658.1 --> 1660.76
okay

1675.26 --> 1678.98
why are globers so angry when they hear

1677.779 --> 1682.52
Flat Earth

1678.98 --> 1685.22
well because they subject themselves to

1682.52 --> 1688.52
to propaganda

1685.22 --> 1690.559
that makes flat earthers in all kinds of

1688.52 --> 1693.3799999999999
ways associated with all kinds of

1690.559 --> 1694.7
terrible things or things proclaimed to

1693.38 --> 1700.1200000000001
be terrible

1694.7 --> 1700.1200000000001
so it is mostly indirect politicization

1701.899 --> 1707.7399999999998
right

1703.159 --> 1707.74
and besides on top of all that

1708.02 --> 1711.32
especially when they don't really when

1710.059 --> 1713.24
they haven't really

1711.32 --> 1716.1789999999999
dealt with flat earthers there's a lot

1713.24 --> 1719.48
of trigger effects which are based in

1716.179 --> 1722.24
very early age conditioning that's

1719.48 --> 1724.279
happened on school in schools

1722.24 --> 1728.6
so there's the conditioning part and

1724.279 --> 1732.26
then there is like the media propaganda

1728.6 --> 1734.24
slander associations and all that

1732.26 --> 1737.52
funny that you mentioned it because

1734.24 --> 1738.799
and for Ed Martin litke

1737.52 --> 1741.1589999999999
[Music]

1738.799 --> 1743.84
like this magazine or something came up

1741.159 --> 1746.96
tartari magazine

1743.84 --> 1749.24
and it was they said it is kind of like

1746.96 --> 1751.1000000000001
controlled opposition too

1749.24 --> 1752.059
don't know for sure if I picked that up

1751.1 --> 1755.1789999999999
right

1752.059 --> 1757.58
it wasn't like really super focused

1755.179 --> 1760.22
what I did hear that and that where it

1757.58 --> 1763.059
like flatters enter Taria is all

1760.22 --> 1765.799
associated with anti-Semitism apparently

1763.059 --> 1769.1
yeah that sort of thing

1765.799 --> 1773.179
right I know that's happening

1769.1 --> 1776.4189999999999
so that part also like amplifies the

1773.179 --> 1778.76
agitation responses

1776.419 --> 1781.76
because it's Weighing on the people that

1778.76 --> 1784.46
actually would be more enabled to buy

1781.76 --> 1788.6
that sort of propaganda crap the really

1784.46 --> 1791.0
stupid superficial slandering ones

1788.6 --> 1792.6789999999999
and yeah at the bottom of it the

1791.0 --> 1794.44
conditioning

1792.679 --> 1797.8400000000001
so there's like this

1794.44 --> 1800.8400000000001
interaction between those two things

1797.84 --> 1803.3799999999999
that keep Ballers stuck in their

1800.84 --> 1803.3799999999999
paradigm

1808.34 --> 1814.279
wow

1810.919 --> 1815.96
don't believe inside what you think flat

1814.279 --> 1818.36
earthers

1815.96 --> 1820.88
don't believe in science well some might

1818.36 --> 1823.6999999999998
reject science

1820.88 --> 1826.279
because it's not really science a lot of

1823.7 --> 1828.8600000000001
science out there is not science and

1826.279 --> 1831.26
like even that is mainstream coming out

1828.86 --> 1834.02
like science has become really

1831.26 --> 1836.48
convoluted and more like a

1834.02 --> 1839.36
modern priesthood

1836.48 --> 1841.039
to suggest this is truth

1839.36 --> 1843.86
right

1841.039 --> 1847.82
it's how it's being abused right now a

1843.86 --> 1851.779
lot it's very very glaring

1847.82 --> 1853.34
everybody's face with the corona issue

1851.779 --> 1855.98
everything that's happening out there

1853.34 --> 1858.019
like

1855.98 --> 1861.22
I don't even need to go into details for

1858.019 --> 1861.22
that you get it

1863.24 --> 1869.179
but yeah that doesn't mean that we don't

1867.019 --> 1872.179
believe in the scientific method right

1869.179 --> 1874.22
the original science

1872.179 --> 1875.0590000000002
the way to establish the cause of an

1874.22 --> 1877.34
effect

1875.059 --> 1879.799
based on experimentation

1877.34 --> 1882.26
natural phenomenon

1879.799 --> 1884.6
right science is extremely specific and

1882.26 --> 1886.76
we believe in it because it's empirical

1884.6 --> 1890.0
right you don't even even have to

1886.76 --> 1892.82
believe in science and it's science then

1890.0 --> 1895.279
you can test it and verify it

1892.82 --> 1897.5
you don't need to believe it

1895.279 --> 1899.659
right that's kind of the point of

1897.5 --> 1902.14
science is that it's empirical and

1899.659 --> 1902.14
repeatable

1902.179 --> 1907.159
ah

1904.7 --> 1908.659
so yeah just because we don't believe

1907.159 --> 1910.7600000000002
the globe doesn't mean we don't believe

1908.659 --> 1912.919
in the scientific method

1910.76 --> 1915.08
that's ridiculous it's actually quite

1912.919 --> 1916.76
the opposite ballers

1915.08 --> 1920.899
believe in

1916.76 --> 1923.0
science which is a giant mechanical

1920.899 --> 1924.34
fairy tale story

1923.0 --> 1928.0
based on a whole bunch of

1924.34 --> 1928.0
presuppositions and math

1928.22 --> 1935.059
which is anything but empirical

1931.519 --> 1937.7
and the more activity flat earthers have

1935.059 --> 1939.799
out here in the field

1937.7 --> 1941.419
doing observations Black Swan

1939.799 --> 1944.299
observations

1941.419 --> 1946.8200000000002
or just simply figuring out physics

1944.299 --> 1949.1589999999999
mechanics and then

1946.82 --> 1951.799
saying basically what if the Earth Was a

1949.159 --> 1954.5590000000002
glow right how would that work with

1951.799 --> 1957.9189999999999
physics right that's science that's

1954.559 --> 1959.299
actually using scientific fact and

1957.919 --> 1961.5800000000002
natural law

1959.299 --> 1963.679
to establish what is possible and what

1961.58 --> 1965.539
is not possible and then basically

1963.679 --> 1968.779
pointing at how the globe just doesn't

1965.539 --> 1970.22
work well that is science right so just

1968.779 --> 1973.399
because we don't believe in the globe

1970.22 --> 1977.0
doesn't mean we don't believe in science

1973.399 --> 1979.279
it's exactly the opposite so these types

1977.0 --> 1983.0
of remarks are pure

1979.279 --> 1984.98
baked in straw man chantings they're

1983.0 --> 1986.96
chantings Ballers do that a lot they

1984.98 --> 1988.7
just chant it like oh flat earthers

1986.96 --> 1990.32
don't believe in science flat earthers

1988.7 --> 1992.48
don't believe in science

1990.32 --> 1994.76
chanting

1992.48 --> 1996.019
because the reality is exactly the

1994.76 --> 1999.44
opposite

1996.019 --> 2001.179
they have convoluted science into

1999.44 --> 2004.38
meaning whatever the [ __ ] they want

2001.179 --> 2004.38
using math

2004.659 --> 2008.6200000000001
and

2006.059 --> 2012.519
avoiding empiricism

2008.62 --> 2015.2199999999998
and especially astrophysics and all that

2012.519 --> 2017.32
avoiding empiricism and then they say

2015.22 --> 2019.019
that is the real science and there is so

2017.32 --> 2023.1
much of it there so much of this story

2019.019 --> 2025.659
so that legitimizes it over actual

2023.1 --> 2029.1
empiricism which is claimed to be

2025.659 --> 2029.1000000000001
science deniers

2029.62 --> 2034.84
when somebody's skeptic against their

2032.2 --> 2036.7
body of science their body of work all

2034.84 --> 2038.1999999999998
their stories

2036.7 --> 2041.6200000000001
all their math

2038.2 --> 2045.159
then where science deniers

2041.62 --> 2048.46
even though skepticism is the antecedent

2045.159 --> 2049.7200000000003
to science because if you have no

2048.46 --> 2053.26
skepticism

2049.72 --> 2056.4399999999996
then you won't probably engage

2053.26 --> 2059.5
in an experiment in order to verify

2056.44 --> 2063.94
whether it is legitimate or not whether

2059.5 --> 2065.679
the effect is actually proven with the

2063.94 --> 2067.48
hypothesis

2065.679 --> 2069.52
right

2067.48 --> 2073.359
you ought to be skeptical and say like

2069.52 --> 2075.639
no I don't I'm not gonna take that thing

2073.359 --> 2079.119
you said for granted no I am gonna test

2075.639 --> 2083.679
it myself because I'm skeptical right

2079.119 --> 2086.619
skepticism is the antecedent to science

2083.679 --> 2089.28
right because it makes you go and find

2086.619 --> 2089.28
the evidence

2089.379 --> 2093.0989999999997
because you don't take it for granted

2092.02 --> 2096.04
see

2093.099 --> 2098.619
in that way you can see now how I laid

2096.04 --> 2102.599
it out it the entire world is reversed

2098.619 --> 2102.599
in their chanting the entire world

2121.599 --> 2127.349
right finally I'm getting the chat going

2124.09 --> 2127.349
[Music]

2130.49 --> 2133.54
[Music]

2134.44 --> 2137.2200000000003
huh

2153.22 --> 2158.64
okay

2155.619 --> 2158.6400000000003
David Wise

2159.22 --> 2166.6189999999997
I'm subscribed to him

2162.46 --> 2166.619
I think I did see that one pop up

2174.22 --> 2179.9399999999996
no wait this is not the kids

2177.22 --> 2179.9399999999996
uh

2186.04 --> 2191.74
is that the video the best flat best

2189.339 --> 2195.48
college on Flat Earth

2191.74 --> 2195.4799999999996
that the video you're referring to

2214.94 --> 2217.989
[Music]

2254.619 --> 2258.52
young girl

2256.48 --> 2262.2
oh

2258.52 --> 2262.2
which show is that

2262.72 --> 2266.2799999999997
is that UK talk radio

2279.94 --> 2284.16
because I'm going through titles right

2281.98 --> 2284.16
now

2284.98 --> 2289.44
what the heck I'll just freaking present

2287.26 --> 2289.44
it

2301.839 --> 2307.14
all right so

2304.24 --> 2307.14
which one

2363.72 --> 2368.0989999999997
oh wow super straight Arthur

2368.32 --> 2372.6600000000003
is is that like the last video

2379.3 --> 2381.8390000000004
what

2407.98 --> 2412.68
now celeb puppets do hidden handsome all

2411.099 --> 2415.6600000000003
right

2412.68 --> 2419.3999999999996
that's uh

2415.66 --> 2419.3999999999996
yeah that's just a cultism

2419.44 --> 2424.18
it's like virtue signaling for

2421.42 --> 2427.1800000000003
Freemasons something in that direction

2424.18 --> 2427.18
turret

2433.72 --> 2437.68
all right it basically symbolizes you're

2436.0 --> 2439.48
up to something

2437.68 --> 2441.8799999999997
because you have a hand hidden you're

2439.48 --> 2444.76
not showing everything so there could be

2441.88 --> 2447.6400000000003
anything there you don't know right

2444.76 --> 2449.7400000000002
that's how it's a symbol

2447.64 --> 2451.24
just look at the symbol and think about

2449.74 --> 2453.819
what can that mean

2451.24 --> 2457.4799999999996
huh

2453.819 --> 2460.68
it's not just random these things

2457.48 --> 2460.68
they thought about it

2462.28 --> 2467.8
like the people that originally

2465.46 --> 2469.9
designed the signs

2467.8 --> 2471.88
right that doesn't mean that celebrities

2469.9 --> 2475.02
using them know what the hell they're

2471.88 --> 2475.02
doing they might

2475.06 --> 2480.54
they might be informed about it no

2477.7 --> 2480.54
guarantees though

2494.14 --> 2497.5789999999997
what is that ferret

2502.02 --> 2507.579
Haley Isaac

2505.619 --> 2510.1800000000003
debunks Flat Earth

2507.579 --> 2510.1800000000003
really

2515.98 --> 2518.64
huh

2520.9 --> 2526.3
whoa that's pretty long over an hour

2524.2 --> 2529.14
yeah I didn't find this video on David

2526.3 --> 2529.1400000000003
Weiss's Channel

2529.54 --> 2532.92
he didn't upload it

2535.06 --> 2539.04
but interesting I'll check that out

2572.92 --> 2577.42
yeah no that's okay Tara 306 I

2575.38 --> 2580.2000000000003
appreciate the link I'll check it out it

2577.42 --> 2580.2000000000003
seems interesting

2614.94 --> 2621.06
NASA building their cities in Antarctica

2618.4 --> 2621.06
wow that's

2627.76 --> 2633.579
have any evidence for that

2630.94 --> 2636.46
like where did they transport all the

2633.579 --> 2639.2400000000002
materials right the city takes up quite

2636.46 --> 2639.2400000000002
a lot of material

2643.66 --> 2649.8999999999996
unless you're suggesting that they've

2646.48 --> 2652.359
built the and in the production industry

2649.9 --> 2654.579
for everything over there

2652.359 --> 2656.92
right then they would need constant

2654.579 --> 2659.38
material transports

2656.92 --> 2660.819
but they would end up with transporting

2659.38 --> 2663.579
stuff

2660.819 --> 2668.819
you know it always happens

2663.579 --> 2668.819
yeah Elites oh not NASA okay okay

2670.599 --> 2674.619
Maybe

2673.18 --> 2678.0
dude

2674.619 --> 2678.0
I wouldn't be surprised

2678.099 --> 2682.98
if they had their own little Colony over

2680.74 --> 2682.9799999999996
there

2701.319 --> 2703.859
hmm

2732.819 --> 2735.42
hmm

2761.56 --> 2766.0
purified any I means you're being

2764.2 --> 2767.3799999999997
watched

2766.0 --> 2769.9
perhaps

2767.38 --> 2771.579
well I see the pyramid and the eye as a

2769.9 --> 2774.04
symbol of consciousness

2771.579 --> 2776.5600000000004
and Consciousness Ascension

2774.04 --> 2779.98
up until like the point where literally

2776.56 --> 2782.5
you start to see everything

2779.98 --> 2785.28
that's what I really think it's about

2782.5 --> 2785.28
consciousness

2785.859 --> 2791.44
and that when you actually Ascend far

2788.68 --> 2793.359
enough you start to see everything you

2791.44 --> 2794.5
start to understand everything right

2793.359 --> 2797.44
this is

2794.5 --> 2800.56
part of the reason

2797.44 --> 2802.06
why I don't I'm not afraid of the

2800.56 --> 2805.2999999999997
symbols

2802.06 --> 2807.88
like I I freaking made symbols I've

2805.3 --> 2810.1600000000003
dabbled in symbolism I literally had

2807.88 --> 2813.1600000000003
still have a website called

2810.16 --> 2813.16
symbolics.now

2813.819 --> 2819.94
that I made in 2006.

2816.94 --> 2823.54
for this sort of study for Consciousness

2819.94 --> 2827.44
studies symbols and like their effects

2823.54 --> 2830.52
on the psyche and and just oh yeah

2827.44 --> 2830.52
it's still there

2831.88 --> 2838.3
right or the true symbol just like a

2835.9 --> 2841.2400000000002
good formulated truthful sentence

2838.3 --> 2844.3590000000004
contains many elements that can be

2841.24 --> 2846.64
interpreted from all kinds of angles and

2844.359 --> 2848.2599999999998
the pyramid with the eye is absolutely

2846.64 --> 2851.98
one of them

2848.26 --> 2855.4
many many different ways many different

2851.98 --> 2857.859
things all in that one symbol so many

2855.4 --> 2860.619
different meanings for different eras

2857.859 --> 2864.24
right it's that strong that's why it's

2860.619 --> 2864.2400000000002
not going away anytime soon

2864.42 --> 2869.319
it's looser yeah see and then then the

2867.28 --> 2870.46
dark ones take over and now it's all

2869.319 --> 2873.22
evil

2870.46 --> 2877.18
because what more

2873.22 --> 2880.2999999999997
would actual dark controllers need than

2877.18 --> 2884.0789999999997
to convince people that the same move

2880.3 --> 2886.7200000000003
for Consciousness is evil right yeah

2884.079 --> 2889.3
that's the ultimate gaslighting that's

2886.72 --> 2891.7599999999998
what they like to do they take effective

2889.3 --> 2894.52
good things then they make up dark

2891.76 --> 2897.099
stories about it or they abuse it in

2894.52 --> 2899.98
situations that don't

2897.099 --> 2902.1400000000003
honor the symbols and then they make

2899.98 --> 2903.64
those disgusting things rub off on the

2902.14 --> 2906.7599999999998
symbols and then it's like oh no the

2903.64 --> 2911.64
symbol is evil because this group uses

2906.76 --> 2911.6400000000003
it right just like the swastika

2912.04 --> 2916.0589999999997
right this is what the darkness does it

2915.04 --> 2919.18
takes

2916.059 --> 2922.2400000000002
symbols communication

2919.18 --> 2925.0589999999997
away from you and Slanders it so that

2922.24 --> 2928.4799999999996
you don't see what it is anymore you

2925.059 --> 2929.7400000000002
only fear what it is associated with

2928.48 --> 2932.819
yeah

2929.74 --> 2932.819
that's what they do

2933.64 --> 2940.9
the symbol is what Vedic did

2938.559 --> 2943.7200000000003
it ain't bad right well the symbol

2940.9 --> 2944.92
actually stands for the northern for the

2943.72 --> 2947.9199999999996
North

2944.92 --> 2950.7400000000002
it is what is it

2947.92 --> 2954.099
there's a certain star formation that

2950.74 --> 2956.5
spins around Polaris and yeah in the

2954.099 --> 2958.96
Four Seasons it is exactly that cross

2956.5 --> 2963.599
that's where it came from

2958.96 --> 2963.599
right it's a Celestial symbol

2964.33 --> 2967.9
[Music]

2965.859 --> 2972.16
and it's been around since the beginning

2967.9 --> 2974.5
of time because that thing is there

2972.16 --> 2976.7999999999997
that sighting is there it's always been

2974.5 --> 2976.8
there

2984.18 --> 2991.4199999999996
so yeah if you find a symbol don't

2988.0 --> 2994.359
squirt over it don't or this group these

2991.42 --> 2997.839
sickos did this and oh my God it's evil

2994.359 --> 3000.54
now because they're dark the demons are

2997.839 --> 3003.72
watching over it that's literally you

3000.54 --> 3005.64
fear-mongering by Design

3003.72 --> 3008.359
because of what they did

3005.64 --> 3008.359
with it

3009.54 --> 3016.079
right what I like to do is say no screw

3013.2 --> 3019.68
the darkness I'm polishing It Off

3016.079 --> 3022.38
I'm polishing that ugly ugly dirt off

3019.68 --> 3024.66
the symbol and I'm trying to restore it

3022.38 --> 3027.42
to its original

3024.66 --> 3030.2999999999997
pure potential

3027.42 --> 3032.28
like the natural potential that's what

3030.3 --> 3035.4
I'm trying to do with many things but it

3032.28 --> 3038.1600000000003
is a very difficult process

3035.4 --> 3041.7000000000003
takes a lot of time

3038.16 --> 3043.68
because indoctrinations just run rampant

3041.7 --> 3046.319
and people start

3043.68 --> 3047.94
very easily clamping onto them and they

3046.319 --> 3050.16
don't know it that's what makes it so

3047.94 --> 3052.2000000000003
powerful the indoctrinations right

3050.16 --> 3054.2999999999997
there's the blatant indoctrinations

3052.2 --> 3056.7599999999998
where they're just in your face cultish

3054.3 --> 3060.119
indoctrination yeah anybody can see that

3056.76 --> 3062.2400000000002
if they allow themselves to be honest

3060.119 --> 3064.98
but then there's the indoctrinations

3062.24 --> 3067.14
that you don't realize are

3064.98 --> 3069.54
indoctrinations because you've always

3067.14 --> 3072.2599999999998
taken it for granted you've never heard

3069.54 --> 3072.2599999999998
an alternative

3072.42 --> 3076.8
so you don't even see them as

3074.94 --> 3079.7400000000002
indoctrinations because they're normal

3076.8 --> 3083.46
because you don't yeah when you don't

3079.74 --> 3084.8999999999996
realize it's an indoctrination then

3083.46 --> 3088.02
they got you

3084.9 --> 3090.54
right knowledge is power if you know it

3088.02 --> 3093.3
for what it really is then it can't have

3090.54 --> 3095.339
power over you

3093.3 --> 3100.1600000000003
so wizard stuff

3095.339 --> 3100.16
I'm a wizard talk about wizard things

3113.88 --> 3119.7000000000003
is the i in the pyramid or is the

3115.8 --> 3119.7000000000003
pyramid in the eye what

3128.04 --> 3134.48
pyramid in the eye what I don't

3131.4 --> 3134.48
understand what you're saying

3138.48 --> 3142.319
but the pyramid can symbolize many

3140.579 --> 3145.579
different things

3142.319 --> 3148.319
and it's weird because I've had like

3145.579 --> 3150.96
hallucinatory experiences

3148.319 --> 3154.74
with entities that literally look like

3150.96 --> 3157.26
them like looked like freaking pyramids

3154.74 --> 3159.359
with with a single eye in them

3157.26 --> 3162.96
although it was in the middle

3159.359 --> 3165.96
and they had like arms and legs really

3162.96 --> 3167.28
weird sort of arms and legs they were in

3165.96 --> 3169.68
clouds

3167.28 --> 3173.3
that was freaky right that makes it even

3169.68 --> 3173.2999999999997
more complicated to me

3189.78 --> 3196.2200000000003
you had sleep paralysis no

3192.599 --> 3196.2200000000003
never had sleep paralysis

3209.7 --> 3215.4199999999996
or at least I might have had one one

3213.18 --> 3215.4199999999996
time

3215.52 --> 3219.24
I don't know

3217.26 --> 3221.8190000000004
it's funny that you bring it up because

3219.24 --> 3224.339
it did like kind of come up in a short

3221.819 --> 3226.619
very short flight just like 10 seconds

3224.339 --> 3228.72
maybe

3226.619 --> 3229.859
where there was something about sleep

3228.72 --> 3232.4399999999996
paralysis

3229.859 --> 3234.7799999999997
but then it moved on in the vision

3232.44 --> 3236.52
because I only basically remember it

3234.78 --> 3238.8590000000004
from the perspective of going through

3236.52 --> 3241.099
the vision there's a lot of things back

3238.859 --> 3241.0989999999997
then

3241.26 --> 3243.98
like I

3244.619 --> 3249.78
I don't have a lot of memory of freaking

3247.38 --> 3252.5
[ __ ] back then it's just my mind worked

3249.78 --> 3252.5
differently I

3254.52 --> 3260.099
Vision memories have always stuck to me

3257.28 --> 3262.44
much more than the actual memories

3260.099 --> 3266.099
that I still have from back then

3262.44 --> 3270.2400000000002
but it's also also logical because I was

3266.099 --> 3272.94
so Out Of Tune I was so out of it out of

3270.24 --> 3277.0789999999997
me out of being what I should be back

3272.94 --> 3279.839
then so far out of it it's embarrassing

3277.079 --> 3282.0
and so the memories from that time were

3279.839 --> 3287.22
on a different frequency they're useless

3282.0 --> 3289.2
to me but the observations are timeless

3287.22 --> 3290.9399999999996
right it's just the way that I was

3289.2 --> 3294.5
dealing with it was completely useless

3290.94 --> 3294.5
in the face of where I'm at now

3297.48 --> 3301.7400000000002
ah

3299.099 --> 3306.059
mushrooms

3301.74 --> 3309.66
but it's probably because of ayahuasca

3306.059 --> 3313.2000000000003
that that stuff I can only effectively

3309.66 --> 3315.1189999999997
remember it having done it once and I

3313.2 --> 3319.46
didn't even know what it was

3315.119 --> 3319.46
the only after that I I wouldn't

3323.7 --> 3329.8799999999997
but yeah that stuff seems to have some

3326.099 --> 3332.6600000000003
kind of cascading effect on me

3329.88 --> 3332.6600000000003
like

3333.96 --> 3337.559
it does more to me than it does to most

3336.54 --> 3340.339
people

3337.559 --> 3340.3390000000004
it's weird

3343.54 --> 3346.67
[Music]

3350.72 --> 3354.2599999999998
no don't do it

3382.92 --> 3388.88
right yeah I'm glad you're getting it

3385.44 --> 3388.88
Terror 306.

3388.92 --> 3394.079
I got dude I can feel from you that

3392.099 --> 3396.42
you've learned a lot you actually pick

3394.079 --> 3398.28
up onto a lot of subtle details of

3396.42 --> 3402.48
things that I talk about

3398.28 --> 3404.2200000000003
it shows it shows that that your

3402.48 --> 3408.42
getting more

3404.22 --> 3411.4399999999996
the bite might be wizard material

3408.42 --> 3411.44
my Indian friend

3412.38 --> 3417.0
I'm very glad you get it

3414.44 --> 3419.16
you're one of the people that has really

3417.0 --> 3421.68
expressed understanding

3419.16 --> 3423.72
and picking up upon

3421.68 --> 3426.839
fractal insight

3423.72 --> 3429.2
it's a very valuable Talent it is a

3426.839 --> 3429.2
talent

3438.059 --> 3443.579
right and I could even associate it with

3441.0 --> 3447.42
the pyramid and I and the eye again

3443.579 --> 3449.579
fractal Insight right that is the way

3447.42 --> 3452.2200000000003
that I've come to describe

3449.579 --> 3455.6400000000003
how I've started to see and understand

3452.22 --> 3457.799
everything which I associate with the

3455.64 --> 3459.359
eye part of the Pyramid of the Ascension

3457.799 --> 3461.16
process

3459.359 --> 3463.2
right

3461.16 --> 3465.72
one of the things that have assisted me

3463.2 --> 3468.1189999999997
most into really overseeing and

3465.72 --> 3471.299
understanding things that I literally

3468.119 --> 3472.6800000000003
cannot handle right that aspect I

3471.299 --> 3475.799
understand the things that I can't

3472.68 --> 3479.22
handle without letting it totally

3475.799 --> 3481.799
consume me and crush me every time it's

3479.22 --> 3483.7799999999997
because of fractal Insight I just look

3481.799 --> 3487.799
at the patterns

3483.78 --> 3489.3590000000004
and see how reality is like a fractal

3487.799 --> 3492.059
pattern

3489.359 --> 3493.44
in from every angle it's like a giant

3492.059 --> 3496.02
crystal

3493.44 --> 3498.96
and you can understand things out of

3496.02 --> 3500.7
reach because of that once you realize

3498.96 --> 3503.52
it

3500.7 --> 3506.64
and you get a better feel you get a

3503.52 --> 3509.7599999999998
grasp on the ungraspable outer reach you

3506.64 --> 3513.299
get a virtual feeling for it

3509.76 --> 3515.4
and that's because golden ratio perhaps

3513.299 --> 3517.619
and that is because of what I call

3515.4 --> 3520.44
fractal insight

3517.619 --> 3523.98
fractal thinking

3520.44 --> 3528.079
right when you do fractal thinking

3523.98 --> 3531.599
you usually end up in light and darkness

3528.079 --> 3534.54
and Beyond and then light and darkness

3531.599 --> 3537.7200000000003
and Beyond light and darkness and Beyond

3534.54 --> 3541.319
right you start to see the existential

3537.72 --> 3543.1189999999997
growing and emergence patterns of things

3541.319 --> 3547.7
if you

3543.119 --> 3547.7000000000003
have such a moment of insight

3565.319 --> 3569.119
it's yogic mudras

3571.5 --> 3574.04
hmm

3583.859 --> 3588.119
yeah there's a lot a lot of things in

3586.559 --> 3590.05
there

3588.119 --> 3593.1690000000003
oh God

3590.05 --> 3593.1690000000003
[Music]

3595.5 --> 3600.42
but for me sometimes you know

3597.96 --> 3602.2200000000003
like really digging into a specific

3600.42 --> 3605.64
material

3602.22 --> 3607.319
I'm often kind of overwhelmed well if I

3605.64 --> 3610.6189999999997
just

3607.319 --> 3613.5589999999997
tap into it superficially grab together

3610.619 --> 3616.619
the memories that I do have

3613.559 --> 3621.48
make them cohesive be consistent be

3616.619 --> 3623.88
honest then I can kind of like grasp

3621.48 --> 3626.4
a whole regions

3623.88 --> 3630.6600000000003
based on also the Assumption the inside

3626.4 --> 3633.42
that it is existentially heavy and

3630.66 --> 3636.1189999999997
contains more that I could handle

3633.42 --> 3639.48
and then I can still understand it and

3636.119 --> 3642.599
kind of grasp it without literally just

3639.48 --> 3646.859
digging through everything

3642.599 --> 3650.099
very up close to my consciousness

3646.859 --> 3653.16
it's part of fractal thinking

3650.099 --> 3656.339
right but the more gradual exposure the

3653.16 --> 3659.64
better the fractal Insight becomes but

3656.339 --> 3662.7
it it's always further

3659.64 --> 3665.16
it's always Beyond

3662.7 --> 3667.2
the more you actually get confronted

3665.16 --> 3669.839
with the better the fractal Insight

3667.2 --> 3672.799
becomes it reaches further you can

3669.839 --> 3677.54
scan further

3672.799 --> 3677.54
this is getting very esoteric now

3679.2 --> 3682.689
um

3679.61 --> 3682.6890000000003
[Music]

3686.359 --> 3690.2
I'm doing a lot better

3694.44 --> 3697.46
it's nice to

3698.7 --> 3703.319
like that

3699.96 --> 3706.7400000000002
it's soothing talking about this and

3703.319 --> 3709.2
just the joy of well my accomplishments

3706.74 --> 3711.1189999999997
based on my talents whatever I I'm

3709.2 --> 3712.6189999999997
afraid to praise myself too much about

3711.119 --> 3715.5
it

3712.619 --> 3718.26
it's a real Comfort literally and it has

3715.5 --> 3720.599
a physiological impact

3718.26 --> 3721.7400000000002
it literally feels like a blessing

3720.599 --> 3723.96
knowing

3721.74 --> 3726.299
these things

3723.96 --> 3728.16
and that whatever Darkness I will be

3726.299 --> 3730.5
confronted with because of it because of

3728.16 --> 3733.5
the brightness it attracts the darkness

3730.5 --> 3735.96
like moth to a flame

3733.5 --> 3739.02
that no matter how [ __ ] up their

3735.96 --> 3743.94
Darkness focus is

3739.02 --> 3748.0389999999998
I understand it more than I need to

3743.94 --> 3748.039
and I have more and I know it

3748.319 --> 3754.079
so the darkness doesn't really terrify

3751.92 --> 3757.28
me anymore

3754.079 --> 3757.28
it used to though

3757.74 --> 3762.5989999999997
or

3759.539 --> 3765.059
maybe it didn't even yeah it did

3762.599 --> 3767.76
it can terrify me but it mostly just

3765.059 --> 3770.2200000000003
anguish and being puzzled

3767.76 --> 3773.3390000000004
I always had for a very long time this

3770.22 --> 3776.0
attitude as to how why God why why are

3773.339 --> 3776.0
you doing this

3777.539 --> 3784.559
and took some decades to get over that

3782.22 --> 3786.24
to really figure out

3784.559 --> 3789.38
about the

3786.24 --> 3792.8999999999996
punishment and reward system in creation

3789.38 --> 3794.76
the logos directive

3792.9 --> 3797.7200000000003
it took me a long time to actually

3794.76 --> 3797.7200000000003
accept that

3801.0 --> 3807.059
because I felt like what I want I want

3804.18 --> 3808.5
God to alter it

3807.059 --> 3811.26
like it

3808.5 --> 3813.359
I I thought it wasn't fair

3811.26 --> 3816.96
now I realize

3813.359 --> 3819.359
that my sense of fairness was very

3816.96 --> 3820.7400000000002
superficial in the face of where I'm at

3819.359 --> 3823.44
now

3820.74 --> 3826.319
again fractal thinking makes it a lot

3823.44 --> 3830.88
clearer and a lot more tolerable to deal

3826.319 --> 3833.5389999999998
with everything and how crazy things get

3830.88 --> 3833.539
some people

3850.5 --> 3855.299
Greatest Secret ever

3853.079 --> 3858.319
was not really The Greatest Secret ever

3855.299 --> 3858.319
it's just out there

3873.119 --> 3875.6600000000003
what

3892.44 --> 3895.28
hmm

3901.74 --> 3908.4599999999996
[Music]

3926.88 --> 3934.039
see the darkness attack it when I can

3930.18 --> 3934.0389999999998
okay well that's difficult Wireless blue

3937.2 --> 3941.22
it's very difficult to actually attack

3939.48 --> 3943.92
the darkness

3941.22 --> 3947.0389999999998
esoterically right because what you're

3943.92 --> 3950.819
going to be dealing with is people

3947.039 --> 3953.579
throwing out [ __ ] to kind of avoid the

3950.819 --> 3957.079
the darkness to avoid some pain to avoid

3953.579 --> 3957.079
realization to avoid

3958.339 --> 3962.72
changing their Consciousness position

3962.819 --> 3970.079
and that is like a minor dark Act

3966.78 --> 3972.42
but if you then dispel the lies that's

3970.079 --> 3974.4
not gonna prevent them from just doing

3972.42 --> 3977.099
it all over again right yeah it's

3974.4 --> 3979.799
pointing it out and that's good doesn't

3977.099 --> 3981.38
get the darkness away now here comes the

3979.799 --> 3986.16
really with the wizard part

3981.38 --> 3990.5
psychological wizard part right you can

3986.16 --> 3990.5
actually take their Darkness away

3990.539 --> 3996.8390000000004
but you have to be really good

3994.68 --> 3999.96
I don't know anybody else besides myself

3996.839 --> 4001.099
and a couple of moments with certain

3999.96 --> 4003.44
people

4001.099 --> 4005.78
I can do that where you can literally

4003.44 --> 4009.079
just reach

4005.78 --> 4011.7200000000003
you can use fractal thinking to see in

4009.079 --> 4014.3590000000004
the moment why somebody

4011.72 --> 4018.5
rolls out certain types of lies or

4014.359 --> 4020.119
evasions of actions and then slip in as

4018.5 --> 4025.18
it happens

4020.119 --> 4025.1800000000003
and actually get a glimpse feeling of

4025.819 --> 4030.2
why they do it

4028.28 --> 4032.48
like their internal thinking

4030.2 --> 4035.7799999999997
justification ping-ponging

4032.48 --> 4037.46
and then yeah you can grasp Way Beyond

4035.78 --> 4039.44
the argument very quickly into

4037.46 --> 4041.7200000000003
somebody's psyche and then basically

4039.44 --> 4046.52
have a meta conversation quickly to them

4041.72 --> 4049.0989999999997
or just like instructions to make them

4046.52 --> 4052.16
give them the possibility to subtly

4049.099 --> 4054.6800000000003
switch to move on

4052.16 --> 4056.96
for which they will have longing because

4054.68 --> 4059.48
nobody that stuck in darkness doesn't

4056.96 --> 4061.46
actually long to move on

4059.48 --> 4063.64
right they might completely keep it a

4061.46 --> 4063.64
secret

4066.319 --> 4070.88
and that's the trick the trick is

4068.0 --> 4074.72
getting to them without

4070.88 --> 4076.7000000000003
just ramming them down just to publicly

4074.72 --> 4078.5589999999997
shame them or anything because that

4076.7 --> 4081.02
doesn't help them out of the darkness it

4078.559 --> 4083.3590000000004
actually kind of justifies it

4081.02 --> 4086.72
you can quickly give someone the

4083.359 --> 4091.18
life-changing advice in the right moment

4086.72 --> 4091.18
that actually dispels the darkness

4091.88 --> 4097.58
but if you do it a lot then people will

4095.359 --> 4099.679
get defenses against it they will know

4097.58 --> 4102.5599999999995
that you do that and they will be less

4099.679 --> 4104.12
easy to reach that's why I do it

4102.56 --> 4106.52
sparingly

4104.12 --> 4108.259
because then when I do it people don't

4106.52 --> 4110.2390000000005
really expect it

4108.259 --> 4112.52
they expect it but they don't know when

4110.239 --> 4114.8589999999995
to expect it right and that way they're

4112.52 --> 4116.96
not building up defense because if you

4114.859 --> 4119.359
do it all the time guess what happens

4116.96 --> 4121.46
part of savonie syndrome right when

4119.359 --> 4124.339
you're constantly pushing constantly

4121.46 --> 4126.44
doing the fall when people will see you

4124.339 --> 4128.299
as a Heckler they will have their shield

4126.44 --> 4131.0599999999995
down they will like stop listening

4128.299 --> 4135.159
because you're over the top

4131.06 --> 4135.159000000001
right part of Savanna syndrome

4138.199 --> 4140.98
the psychology

4148.94 --> 4151.54
all right

4165.739 --> 4170.98
the flower of life should be mandatory

4168.44 --> 4170.98
education

4172.48 --> 4176.379999999999
mandatory what

4176.839 --> 4182.0599999999995
no

4179.659 --> 4184.94
like mandatory educate what is this

4182.06 --> 4187.4800000000005
mandatory education you're talking about

4184.94 --> 4187.48
right

4188.779 --> 4194.7390000000005
like why should there be mandatory

4192.14 --> 4194.7390000000005
education

4196.88 --> 4203.12
isn't that kind of where we got

4199.76 --> 4205.34
why we got to this position we're at in

4203.12 --> 4207.98
the first place because they did mandate

4205.34 --> 4210.02
it and then all kinds of nonsense became

4207.98 --> 4212.839999999999
part of that mandate

4210.02 --> 4213.620000000001
right and then suddenly the Earth was a

4212.84 --> 4216.56
ball

4213.62 --> 4218.78
and [ __ ] that's because of mandating

4216.56 --> 4222.4400000000005
Education

4218.78 --> 4225.44
right people should have good materials

4222.44 --> 4228.259999999999
available and yes especially the

4225.44 --> 4230.0599999999995
youngsters should be motivated to engage

4228.26 --> 4231.679
in studying when their mind is still

4230.06 --> 4235.3
fresh

4231.679 --> 4235.3
but to mandate it

4236.96 --> 4243.679
it doesn't always work

4240.08 --> 4247.54
even if you try to like force an average

4243.679 --> 4247.54
understanding about something right

4248.659 --> 4255.04
like leave education to the

4252.08 --> 4255.04
to the willing

4256.04 --> 4261.94
joking about the man okay the I 80 64.

4263.02 --> 4267.64
education is not necessarily bad

4271.58 --> 4279.5599999999995
but I think that

4274.64 --> 4283.88
true academics should have priority

4279.56 --> 4287.780000000001
over yeah the academic should be

4283.88 --> 4290.3
in control over educations

4287.78 --> 4292.699
of all levels right it should be

4290.3 --> 4294.5
academic and not political

4292.699 --> 4299.799999999999
not

4294.5 --> 4299.8
based on like who pays the most [ __ ]

4300.26 --> 4304.12
because that's part of the problem as

4301.94 --> 4304.12
well

4312.62 --> 4318.679
my daughter's not indoctrinated but my

4314.9 --> 4321.139999999999
son sadly is well yeah typical you know

4318.679 --> 4324.14
the boys always get

4321.14 --> 4326.719
much more easily indoctrinated with the

4324.14 --> 4328.64
ball than than the girls it just appeals

4326.719 --> 4331.52
to them more it did to me when I was a

4328.64 --> 4333.320000000001
kid I was like on that ball boy I was

4331.52 --> 4336.219
there I was like no I'm gonna be a

4333.32 --> 4336.219
[ __ ] astronaut

4337.04 --> 4342.44
right and like that like yeah you're not

4340.4 --> 4344.599999999999
gonna [ __ ] stop me like as a little

4342.44 --> 4346.159
kid I was like no I'm going to be that

4344.6 --> 4349.159000000001
[ __ ] astronaut

4346.159 --> 4351.259999999999
like I was that much on the ball and

4349.159 --> 4353.36
then it started to sip through seep

4351.26 --> 4355.52
through like with [ __ ] and they're

4353.36 --> 4358.759999999999
liars and there's something really weird

4355.52 --> 4362.5
going on it's the world is strange

4358.76 --> 4362.5
it's not what they make you think it is

4363.02 --> 4368.540000000001
but I'm basically still being

4365.9 --> 4370.28
that astronaut it's just not the type of

4368.54 --> 4373.28
astronaut that I thought it was going to

4370.28 --> 4375.62
be it's more like a mental astronaut I

4373.28 --> 4378.099999999999
tried to explore the mind and the

4375.62 --> 4378.099999999999
consciousness

4378.739 --> 4382.659
it's more like a psycho knot

4391.64 --> 4395.38
a slow-mo moon buggy

4396.62 --> 4401.62
Jim Bob no

4399.02 --> 4401.620000000001
what

4404.36 --> 4408.98
mind control starts with Santa Claus nah

4407.239 --> 4411.139999999999
pear-shaped

4408.98 --> 4413.419999999999
now with me it started with the ball in

4411.14 --> 4416.780000000001
outer space and sci-fi and my space

4413.42 --> 4418.159
Legos oh yeah space Lagos that's what

4416.78 --> 4420.8
it's all about

4418.159 --> 4423.98
I got like

4420.8 --> 4427.3
the time span of 10 years I got a lot of

4423.98 --> 4427.299999999999
space Legos still do

4441.199 --> 4446.839999999999
and Santa Claus and Center class from

4444.44 --> 4448.219
for me in the Netherlands that came kind

4446.84 --> 4450.5
of later

4448.219 --> 4452.3
and I never took that too serious that

4450.5 --> 4454.76
was not too much

4452.3 --> 4456.1990000000005
tension on that it wasn't really

4454.76 --> 4459.14
contended

4456.199 --> 4461.0599999999995
like I didn't really care that much

4459.14 --> 4463.1
thought it was fun

4461.06 --> 4465.5
but I just saw this like no that's just

4463.1 --> 4466.88
a periodic event thing and there's just

4465.5 --> 4470.26
theatrics

4466.88 --> 4470.26
because I could see you again

4471.98 --> 4475.4
like I could see that as a kid but it

4473.78 --> 4478.0
didn't matter because I knew it it's

4475.4 --> 4478.0
like an act

4478.58 --> 4482.9
like

4479.6 --> 4485.42
I never put weight on it I guess you

4482.9 --> 4487.759999999999
could compare it to how chocolate Saiyan

4485.42 --> 4491.0
says he always saw the ball like he

4487.76 --> 4494.780000000001
never really believed it I did

4491.0 --> 4499.48
but with me it was with like Santa Claus

4494.78 --> 4499.48
like I never really believed that

4499.52 --> 4503.360000000001
the only thing that really was a big

4501.44 --> 4506.0
disappointment about it is that yeah

4503.36 --> 4508.36
there is no free presence right that was

4506.0 --> 4511.1
kind of the only part about it

4508.36 --> 4513.5599999999995
it had a bit trouble getting over but

4511.1 --> 4516.56
yeah it was short-lived got over that

4513.56 --> 4520.06
after like a week or something

4516.56 --> 4520.06
when I first found out

4600.92 --> 4603.92
foreign

4646.04 --> 4652.94
while seeking star water you don't know

4649.58 --> 4656.6
you know Vatican might be

4652.94 --> 4659.659
guarding over information and [ __ ] and

4656.6 --> 4662.4800000000005
like technological developments

4659.659 --> 4665.839999999999
that maybe the entire world shouldn't

4662.48 --> 4669.639999999999
just have it right you don't know what

4665.84 --> 4669.64
they're really guarding

4670.28 --> 4675.679
some of it yeah when you if you would

4673.28 --> 4678.5599999999995
ever get be able to get a glimpse at it

4675.679 --> 4680.96
you might think like well maybe this

4678.56 --> 4683.54
shouldn't be just openly

4680.96 --> 4685.159
readable for anybody who would like to

4683.54 --> 4687.679
right

4685.159 --> 4690.219
you don't know what they're actually

4687.679 --> 4690.219
guarding

4692.239 --> 4696.44
so don't be too quick to judge that

4694.58 --> 4700.659
everything they have should just be

4696.44 --> 4700.659
public to anybody you don't know that

4711.92 --> 4715.54
are we in the sensor no

4716.78 --> 4720.62
that's

4718.64 --> 4725.26
maybe they have stuff that just

4720.62 --> 4725.26
shouldn't be known right

4729.32 --> 4733.759999999999
I don't know I'm not saying that

4731.78 --> 4734.719
justifies what they've what they're

4733.76 --> 4737.179
doing

4734.719 --> 4740.62
I'm just saying it might turn out to be

4737.179 --> 4740.62
different than what you'd expect

4747.86 --> 4752.42
disagree with you vehemently okay fine

4750.26 --> 4753.92
well look there's certainly things that

4752.42 --> 4757.04
they're going to be guarding over that

4753.92 --> 4759.38
would reveal a lot about

4757.04 --> 4760.82
the nature and the design of the realm

4759.38 --> 4764.6
and all that yeah sure those things

4760.82 --> 4766.88
should probably be Declassified

4764.6 --> 4768.620000000001
I'm not saying that this should just all

4766.88 --> 4770.659000000001
sit on everything and keep it all to

4768.62 --> 4774.14
them so that's not what I'm saying I'm

4770.659 --> 4776.0
just saying if you just did cry that all

4774.14 --> 4778.76
of everything they got should just be

4776.0 --> 4782.679
open that could

4778.76 --> 4782.679
turn not so good

4790.94 --> 4797.96
okay the I 80 64. what about those

4794.54 --> 4800.48
things that weren't written by mankind

4797.96 --> 4803.659
yeah

4800.48 --> 4807.379999999999
you don't know the world is a strange

4803.659 --> 4811.239
place a lot happens over time

4807.38 --> 4811.2390000000005
weird things happen over time

4826.699 --> 4831.82
written by Horace kind that's hilarious

4836.96 --> 4841.06
does he live related to Jim

4868.1 --> 4872.84
okay so let me give you a very

4870.32 --> 4876.799999999999
disgusting example

4872.84 --> 4882.139
so what about all the Phoenician torture

4876.8 --> 4885.4400000000005
manuals on how like to maximize

4882.139 --> 4887.3
that [ __ ] because they probably sit on

4885.44 --> 4890.178999999999
that as well should that just be readily

4887.3 --> 4892.219
available for everybody right or anybody

4890.179 --> 4895.46
who wants to learn how to do that even

4892.219 --> 4897.86
though it's [ __ ] evil yeah just an

4895.46 --> 4899.54
example you don't know everything

4897.86 --> 4901.94
they're sitting on

4899.54 --> 4903.98
you don't want everything to just be

4901.94 --> 4906.739
available to everybody

4903.98 --> 4908.0
because there's [ __ ] up people in the

4906.739 --> 4910.599999999999
world

4908.0 --> 4910.6
right

4918.8 --> 4923.4800000000005
just practical thinking don't be so

4922.159 --> 4927.08
short-sighted

4923.48 --> 4928.94
don't pick out that one little gem and

4927.08 --> 4931.82
say everything has to be Declassified

4928.94 --> 4936.739
because there's one thing in there that

4931.82 --> 4938.599999999999
I want now so everything must be free no

4936.739 --> 4941.718999999999
don't be an idiot

4938.6 --> 4945.860000000001
this is don't be selfish don't let

4941.719 --> 4951.159
Lucifer make you open that Pandora's Box

4945.86 --> 4951.159
just like that metaphorically right

4971.659 --> 4976.599999999999
an embarrassment of penis what

4993.8 --> 4996.400000000001
right

5002.98 --> 5006.94
yeah I don't really care too much about

5005.199 --> 5010.12
Jam Panda thanks

5006.94 --> 5012.04
I don't follow him it's just a waste of

5010.12 --> 5017.08
time

5012.04 --> 5017.08
to permanently delusional individual

5038.199 --> 5043.12
all right

5039.6 --> 5046.179
but yeah again

5043.12 --> 5049.54
Vatican sitting on secret knowledge

5046.179 --> 5053.92
well things that would be cool to have

5049.54 --> 5055.96
Declassified is actual exploration Maps

5053.92 --> 5059.38
like of beyond the land because you

5055.96 --> 5062.8
could guarantee that they got that [ __ ]

5059.38 --> 5066.1
like as far as it exists they have it

5062.8 --> 5067.3
and maybe it's already thrown out there

5066.1 --> 5071.34
right

5067.3 --> 5075.6990000000005
maybe maybe we already got

5071.34 --> 5079.0
most or partial of what they are sitting

5075.699 --> 5081.159
on it's just spread throughout the

5079.0 --> 5083.86
internet like that secretly and then it

5081.159 --> 5086.08
just becomes public I don't know

5083.86 --> 5087.759999999999
I don't know even like what their plan

5086.08 --> 5090.1
is with everything they're sitting on

5087.76 --> 5092.08
because they're sitting on a whole bunch

5090.1 --> 5094.96
of papers there

5092.08 --> 5100.62
and objects

5094.96 --> 5103.3
right it's like this Treasure Trove of

5100.62 --> 5106.0599999999995
technology and knowledge

5103.3 --> 5107.8
and most of them probably literally

5106.06 --> 5109.900000000001
don't even know what the hell to do with

5107.8 --> 5111.820000000001
it they're just like well we're assigned

5109.9 --> 5114.28
to guard this [ __ ]

5111.82 --> 5118.179
just following the program this is all

5114.28 --> 5121.5
[ __ ] up stuff this is

5118.179 --> 5121.5
nature head spin

5135.62 --> 5138.83
[Music]

5145.239 --> 5149.62
why do you presume anyone has the

5147.58 --> 5153.42
authority to classify info in the first

5149.62 --> 5153.42
place well because they can

5159.639 --> 5164.5
or I'm calling it classify and

5161.86 --> 5169.48
declassify it's based on like American

5164.5 --> 5169.48
government and Secret Service lingo

5169.84 --> 5174.400000000001
because that's the only thing that I

5171.88 --> 5177.46
have kind of examples have seen examples

5174.4 --> 5179.92
of to compare it with right I don't know

5177.46 --> 5182.26
what they call it I don't exactly I

5179.92 --> 5184.6
don't know too much about it

5182.26 --> 5187.4800000000005
just know that the Jesuits are kind of

5184.6 --> 5190.08
like one of the earliest Secret Service

5187.48 --> 5190.08
things

5190.12 --> 5194.86
that have been around for a very long

5191.92 --> 5198.659
time that they came out of that I was

5194.86 --> 5198.659
just Banking and information

5226.38 --> 5230.139
okay so you can start water just as long

5228.94 --> 5232.0599999999995
as you know if you call yourself

5230.139 --> 5234.400000000001
Sovereign then you're basically

5232.06 --> 5237.6990000000005
declaring a kingdom

5234.4 --> 5241.78
and then you must be able to

5237.699 --> 5244.599999999999
yeah you you then become also

5241.78 --> 5247.179
responsible in defending yourself

5244.6 --> 5249.780000000001
with everything and providing for your

5247.179 --> 5249.78
own food

5252.4 --> 5257.379999999999
right but that's just technical I

5254.8 --> 5260.639
understand what you mean you don't you

5257.38 --> 5260.639
don't accept their Authority

5350.739 --> 5354.839999999999
hey Julie of Heaven good to see you

5366.639 --> 5368.82
foreign

5370.42 --> 5375.3
oh yeah hello by the way Brandon I'm

5372.639 --> 5375.3
good to see you

5402.639 --> 5405.179
hmm

5406.84 --> 5413.28
well pear-shaped

5409.96 --> 5413.28
I don't know about that one

5418.96 --> 5424.9800000000005
like bumps still get bombarded with all

5421.9 --> 5424.98
kinds of [ __ ]

5425.139 --> 5431.56
hoops relocations and

5429.219 --> 5436.179
you can bet your ass that they're trying

5431.56 --> 5436.179
to force vaccines on them constantly

5457.06 --> 5459.54
hmm

5468.52 --> 5474.34
that's a good point there the i-8064 yes

5472.179 --> 5477.179
legality can't touch Sovereign man not

5474.34 --> 5477.179
only the legal person

5480.699 --> 5487.5
oh god dude the bacterial rag wearing

5484.06 --> 5487.5
Dunces have any hope left

5487.719 --> 5492.58
that's quite a heavy question there

5489.88 --> 5496.179
tarot I think a lot of people are are

5492.58 --> 5499.239
wondering about that for some time like

5496.179 --> 5502.3
like they get they gotta stop at some

5499.239 --> 5503.379999999999
point right that's what as you figured

5502.3 --> 5504.9400000000005
it out

5503.38 --> 5507.159000000001
took it off

5504.94 --> 5509.32
like they gotta stop at some point right

5507.159 --> 5511.78
or they're gonna get themselves killed

5509.32 --> 5513.759999999999
well you'd be surprised how many people

5511.78 --> 5517.84
are actually

5513.76 --> 5519.639
in their actions getting obsessed

5517.84 --> 5524.7390000000005
getting obsessed with it with the

5519.639 --> 5524.7390000000005
difference they're like in a reenactment

5524.92 --> 5531.76
of a movie of a virus movie that's gone

5528.219 --> 5534.699
live and they lost themselves in the

5531.76 --> 5537.159000000001
suspense of disbelief right it's kind of

5534.699 --> 5540.36
like how Ballers hang on to the ball

5537.159 --> 5543.46
except much worse and it's much more

5540.36 --> 5546.4
damaging to the spirit too

5543.46 --> 5547.6
right so they're obsessed and I'm afraid

5546.4 --> 5550.179
that

5547.6 --> 5552.219
the the ones that are really keeping

5550.179 --> 5554.32
that mask on like they got a serious

5552.219 --> 5555.82
serious problem

5554.32 --> 5557.86
I don't think

5555.82 --> 5560.679
that those people are going to survive

5557.86 --> 5562.719
they're not going to last very long

5560.679 --> 5566.4
right even if they manage to avoid

5562.719 --> 5566.4
getting poisoned to death

5566.739 --> 5572.32
the psychological influence of it alone

5569.38 --> 5574.4800000000005
is going to just degenerate them over

5572.32 --> 5577.42
time they're not they're gonna get less

5574.48 --> 5579.218999999999
healthy their skin is gonna start

5577.42 --> 5581.5
getting messed up

5579.219 --> 5585.159
and I'm afraid that most of them are

5581.5 --> 5588.239
just not gonna make make it past it past

5585.159 --> 5588.239
the next decade

5589.96 --> 5592.86
fear the worst

5593.139 --> 5598.1990000000005
and in the meantime a whole bunch of

5594.88 --> 5598.1990000000005
them are just gonna drop dead

5598.239 --> 5602.159
the ones that take the vaccine that is

5607.54 --> 5612.5199999999995
that the vaccine that's not a vaccine

5610.42 --> 5615.4
if it were a vaccine there might

5612.52 --> 5619.620000000001
actually be a reason to take it

5615.4 --> 5619.62
but it's not a vaccine it's just a

5619.96 --> 5623.639
medical experiment

5638.26 --> 5645.780000000001
oh God slow-mo moon buggy that sucks

5642.76 --> 5645.780000000001
that's terrible

5649.54 --> 5655.06
oh

5650.86 --> 5657.839999999999
rocket blimps oh my God

5655.06 --> 5657.84
oh

5660.46 --> 5667.6
your mom died yesterday from very oh

5664.36 --> 5670.299999999999
well don't make a Facebook post about it

5667.6 --> 5673.8
though or they'll delete your account

5670.3 --> 5673.8
but that's terrible news

5674.5 --> 5678.0
I'm so sorry for you

5678.46 --> 5681.6
how old was she

5701.4 --> 5707.4
78.

5703.06 --> 5707.400000000001
right yeah that's that's definitely

5709.0 --> 5715.139
the the older you get the more likely

5711.639 --> 5715.139
it's gonna kill you so

5715.42 --> 5718.92
anyway condolences

5747.52 --> 5752.619000000001
hmm

5750.159 --> 5755.86
really Georgetown for Facebook is

5752.619 --> 5758.38
allowing coronavirus posts now since

5755.86 --> 5760.599999999999
since they're gonna blame it all on

5758.38 --> 5763.36
China

5760.6 --> 5765.52
I I heard something about that that

5763.36 --> 5767.739
there was a like an attitude change from

5765.52 --> 5770.280000000001
Facebook I heard it through Infowars yet

5767.739 --> 5773.32
sometimes actually pays to follow that

5770.28 --> 5776.739
but I I did hear something about that so

5773.32 --> 5781.08
you can post again like oh my

5776.739 --> 5781.08
mother died from taking the shot

5798.4 --> 5804.299999999999
what

5800.32 --> 5804.299999999999
definitely mutant what

5811.719 --> 5815.52
a good servant good to see you

5815.98 --> 5821.199
all right now this is how I like my chat

5819.04 --> 5823.78
right so when the show started the first

5821.199 --> 5825.58
50 minutes it sucked because it's just a

5823.78 --> 5827.92
bunch of hey

5825.58 --> 5831.4
that's it then I tried to dress and wait

5827.92 --> 5833.56
for like five minutes no response this

5831.4 --> 5836.879999999999
is this is what I'm looking for this is

5833.56 --> 5836.88
the type of chat that I want

5840.82 --> 5843.84
that would be great

5846.1 --> 5848.219
yeah

5848.44 --> 5854.879999999999
I got extended ah [ __ ]

5852.04 --> 5854.88
why is that

5856.719 --> 5865.8
I thought you were gonna go back

5860.199 --> 5865.799999999999
did you extend it or did they extend it

5883.84 --> 5888.219
yes I know clutch bear what kind of a

5886.0 --> 5889.719
bear are you all bears get up at five

5888.219 --> 5891.4
o'clocks

5889.719 --> 5895.56
five o'clock

5891.4 --> 5895.5599999999995
to milk their goats it's no excuse

5912.28 --> 5915.469999999999
[Music]

5917.28 --> 5922.599999999999
when you are consistently late to start

5920.739 --> 5926.44
its stuff

5922.6 --> 5928.92
well I'm not that late it's like five or

5926.44 --> 5928.919999999999
ten minutes

5929.139 --> 5933.719
like I'm rarely much later than that

5937.179 --> 5944.28
but yes I have to admit I'm not always

5939.6 --> 5944.280000000001
exactly on time I'm sorry about that

5945.88 --> 5951.159000000001
actions look especially when the weather

5947.98 --> 5955.739
is all rainy and [ __ ] you know

5951.159 --> 5955.739
that's when I get timing issues

5960.82 --> 5964.239
long story

5962.56 --> 5967.56
oh

5964.239 --> 5967.5599999999995
somebody something happened

5969.58 --> 5972.58
espresso

5977.26 --> 5981.88
get stable after oh okay okay dude good

5980.44 --> 5983.799999999999
servant are you sure you want to drink

5981.88 --> 5986.5
coffee

5983.8 --> 5990.400000000001
you have stomach issues right

5986.5 --> 5992.92
yeah I recommend against drinking coffee

5990.4 --> 5995.138999999999
especially things like espresso which

5992.92 --> 5996.76
are even more few nest

5995.139 --> 5999.46
on the stomach

5996.76 --> 6002.119000000001
right that is the issue right

5999.46 --> 6002.119
part of it

6005.699 --> 6010.5599999999995
or oh wait you were talking to seeking

6008.46 --> 6014.54
star water

6010.56 --> 6014.54
right espresso machine wakes me up

6016.679 --> 6021.2390000000005
huh

6018.84 --> 6022.860000000001
on a coffee roast right well if you

6021.239 --> 6025.759999999999
really know what you're doing seeking

6022.86 --> 6025.759999999999
star water then

6025.86 --> 6029.0599999999995
I'm gonna quit when I get

6029.28 --> 6033.599999999999
right

6030.78 --> 6035.4
like just be very careful with the

6033.6 --> 6039.08
coffee goat servants since the stomach

6035.4 --> 6039.08
isn't a continuing issue

6039.48 --> 6045.299999999999
like and even if you're like having real

6042.179 --> 6047.04
trouble quitting entirely you know and

6045.3 --> 6049.02
it can be Troublesome especially if

6047.04 --> 6051.0
you're gonna go off other meds too you

6049.02 --> 6054.0
know it's very you're gonna have to get

6051.0 --> 6054.9
used to then I guess dilute it down a

6054.0 --> 6057.62
little

6054.9 --> 6059.699
so you can get over

6057.62 --> 6063.659
[Music]

6059.699 --> 6065.339999999999
like the the addiction withdrawal side

6063.659 --> 6069.2699999999995
effects

6065.34 --> 6076.56
but not like impact your stomach as much

6069.27 --> 6079.7390000000005
[Music]

6076.56 --> 6083.96
just drink water nothing okay that's

6079.739 --> 6083.959999999999
good make sure it's filtered water

6084.179 --> 6087.36
so make sure it is defloridated and all

6086.52 --> 6090.0
that

6087.36 --> 6091.08
also not good for your stomach and other

6090.0 --> 6093.679
things

6091.08 --> 6093.679
ah

6094.5 --> 6097.739
you do have a water filter right of some

6097.02 --> 6099.6
kind

6097.739 --> 6102.959999999999
you can do it in all kinds of ways you

6099.6 --> 6105.780000000001
can take a what they call gravity filter

6102.96 --> 6108.96
with like carbon elements in a tank

6105.78 --> 6110.4
that's how I do it I do ceramic elements

6108.96 --> 6113.04
works even better

6110.4 --> 6114.659
or you could do the

6113.04 --> 6116.96
like

6114.659 --> 6119.339999999999
completely

6116.96 --> 6123.2390000000005
demineralize it and then

6119.34 --> 6124.139
yeah cook it or what is it uh you call

6123.239 --> 6127.0199999999995
that

6124.139 --> 6129.119
there's all kinds of way to filter water

6127.02 --> 6130.860000000001
distilled water that's the one yes thank

6129.119 --> 6133.38
you

6130.86 --> 6136.98
but if you distill water then it's also

6133.38 --> 6138.6
gonna be less filled with minerals or

6136.98 --> 6140.759999999999
none at all

6138.6 --> 6142.139
and your body is going to miss that so

6140.76 --> 6145.7390000000005
you got to be careful

6142.139 --> 6148.08
you have a filter oh that's great

6145.739 --> 6151.379999999999
is it like a proper

6148.08 --> 6154.5
carbon or a ceramic filter

6151.38 --> 6158.96
like a real filter element

6154.5 --> 6158.96
those are the best reverse osmosis

6159.0 --> 6162.679
that's not really a filter

6163.86 --> 6168.96
that's a water collector

6166.38 --> 6171.42
that's something else

6168.96 --> 6173.58
and there is problems with the water

6171.42 --> 6176.4
that comes out of reverse osmosis

6173.58 --> 6179.159
seriously look into it like this was

6176.4 --> 6181.98
even back in the day at a big issue

6179.159 --> 6186.0
with Alex Jones it was very always been

6181.98 --> 6187.919999999999
interested in Water Systems he had one

6186.0 --> 6189.84
and then he figured out like wait the

6187.92 --> 6192.2390000000005
quality of water that comes out of it is

6189.84 --> 6195.78
actually not good at all you need to add

6192.239 --> 6197.699
stuff change the frequency and all that

6195.78 --> 6202.5599999999995
that's why I kind of dropped those

6197.699 --> 6206.419999999999
systems in his selling range

6202.56 --> 6206.42
the first osmosis is the best it's

6210.0 --> 6214.82
I I be careful about that

6216.719 --> 6222.0
Pro pure yeah well that's the basic what

6219.0 --> 6224.94
they call gravity based system

6222.0 --> 6227.34
that's the simplest version and it's

6224.94 --> 6228.719
also the best quality water comes out of

6227.34 --> 6229.860000000001
that usually if you have the right

6228.719 --> 6231.3
elements

6229.86 --> 6233.5199999999995
you know

6231.3 --> 6236.04
you have to replace them though every

6233.52 --> 6238.92
now and then so like the carbon filters

6236.04 --> 6242.6
you have to regularly replace ceramic

6238.92 --> 6242.6
filters you can do very long with them

6247.199 --> 6252.54
but yeah mouth eyes

6249.96 --> 6255.96
are you always using reverse osmosis I

6252.54 --> 6257.94
mean like in a desert a reverse osmosis

6255.96 --> 6259.9800000000005
system is a pretty awesome thing to have

6257.94 --> 6261.54
I'm not going to deny that like if

6259.98 --> 6263.699
you're in the dryer yeah those things

6261.54 --> 6265.0199999999995
are they literally just make water out

6263.699 --> 6266.28
of the air

6265.02 --> 6268.38
but

6266.28 --> 6270.659
if you're literally just gonna drink it

6268.38 --> 6273.56
out of that system it's actually not

6270.659 --> 6273.5599999999995
really healthy

6274.32 --> 6279.239
you gotta alter it

6277.26 --> 6281.280000000001
you got to change the frequency

6279.239 --> 6283.739
especially there's something like like

6281.28 --> 6284.699
the water is distorted that comes out of

6283.739 --> 6290.099999999999
it

6284.699 --> 6292.678999999999
the ideas like uh good crystals

6290.1 --> 6295.679
to kind of like change the frequency of

6292.679 --> 6297.84
it I have a penalizer specifically

6295.679 --> 6299.6990000000005
designed to do that that would actually

6297.84 --> 6301.8
work great on it

6299.699 --> 6304.4
because I wouldn't just drink what comes

6301.8 --> 6304.400000000001
out of the machine

6311.699 --> 6316.98
you don't use your friend swears okay

6314.52 --> 6320.96
okay mouth eyes well you might want to

6316.98 --> 6320.959999999999
him inform him about this

6321.119 --> 6323.719
right

6326.82 --> 6330.0199999999995
get on a boat

6347.52 --> 6350.6
it's cream

6351.96 --> 6354.679
what

6355.139 --> 6357.86
now

6369.199 --> 6375.138999999999
we're talking about a system that draws

6371.88 --> 6375.139
it out of the air right

6399.6 --> 6405.6
hmm

6402.239 --> 6408.119
yeah Berkey filter house yeah I I still

6405.6 --> 6410.52
got the Berkey tank I got this like in

6408.119 --> 6413.219
2000

6410.52 --> 6415.92
or something

6413.219 --> 6418.26
so I I got a big tank it's kind of rare

6415.92 --> 6420.659
to get those but I put like the the

6418.26 --> 6423.900000000001
filters that you can put in those those

6420.659 --> 6426.839999999999
have been developing for quite some time

6423.9 --> 6429.599999999999
newer versions better versions

6426.84 --> 6432.0
but the old tank I really appreciate

6429.6 --> 6433.8
just this big

6432.0 --> 6436.199
shiny

6433.8 --> 6439.6990000000005
steel tank love it

6436.199 --> 6439.699
easy for transport

6448.5 --> 6454.02
reverse osmosis is a membrane that's not

6452.46 --> 6457.02
foreign

6454.02 --> 6457.02
it

6467.639 --> 6472.92
it's a membrane okay well I don't know

6471.179 --> 6475.5
about that

6472.92 --> 6478.8
specific reference I just remember

6475.5 --> 6483.739
reverse osmosis being in a system

6478.8 --> 6483.7390000000005
that catches the water out of the air

6483.8 --> 6487.860000000001
electrically right away

6485.88 --> 6491.219
and that the water coming out of that

6487.86 --> 6495.119
you can get quite a lot out of it but

6491.219 --> 6496.92
it's like not ready for a drink

6495.119 --> 6498.78
because it gives problems when you do

6496.92 --> 6500.639
that that's what I learned from it so

6498.78 --> 6502.86
what you're talking about right now

6500.639 --> 6505.6990000000005
reverse most as being something else I

6502.86 --> 6505.699
don't know about that

6519.06 --> 6522.8
a to machine

6524.159 --> 6529.619
what reverse osmosis machine misinformed

6562.02 --> 6566.400000000001
hmm

6564.48 --> 6569.659
all right yeah that's a good one I heard

6566.4 --> 6569.659
of that iron Fe

6594.96 --> 6598.28
e okay okay

6626.06 --> 6631.56
okay well apparently I have been

6628.739 --> 6634.04
misinformed yeah I thought it was

6631.56 --> 6634.04
something else

6657.179 --> 6663.599
okay okay I see it now

6660.54 --> 6664.8
it's specifically ever a filtering

6663.599 --> 6666.7390000000005
process

6664.8 --> 6670.8
foreign

6666.739 --> 6672.36
okay then I may have misunderstood the

6670.8 --> 6673.9800000000005
context

6672.36 --> 6676.86
originally

6673.98 --> 6679.919999999999
that the system that which would draw

6676.86 --> 6682.679
water out of the air would also use

6679.92 --> 6686.719
reverse osmosis but I think it's not the

6682.679 --> 6686.719
reverse osmosis that was the problem

6686.82 --> 6691.0199999999995
which apparently you can apply

6688.44 --> 6693.598999999999
separately it was the drawing the water

6691.02 --> 6696.659000000001
from the air system that was the problem

6693.599 --> 6699.06
right so I may have accidentally just

6696.659 --> 6701.82
smeared reverse osmosis when it was not

6699.06 --> 6706.219
the faulty part

6701.82 --> 6706.219
of the example back in the time

6711.54 --> 6714.199
interesting

6718.32 --> 6724.4
that's pretty interesting that it can

6720.54 --> 6724.4
literally just desalinate water

6731.34 --> 6735.56
like what kind of material is that even

6740.46 --> 6746.719
what kind of material does that

6744.179 --> 6746.719
hmm

6747.9 --> 6752.179
do an extra 20 minutes no

6762.96 --> 6767.94
man

6765.36 --> 6770.5199999999995
yeah you're right dude if this really

6767.94 --> 6771.96
works well then every freaking boat in

6770.52 --> 6773.52
the world should have one of those

6771.96 --> 6776.639
things

6773.52 --> 6777.780000000001
just as a standard issue like built in

6776.639 --> 6780.96
the wall

6777.78 --> 6782.639
this is just

6780.96 --> 6785.58
that would be brilliant you could just

6782.639 --> 6786.84
literally have like the standard tap

6785.58 --> 6789.9
water

6786.84 --> 6791.6990000000005
just be reverse osmosis drawing it from

6789.9 --> 6795.36
wherever you are at

6791.699 --> 6797.9
just from the river or from the ocean

6795.36 --> 6797.9
hmm

6811.38 --> 6813.9800000000005
right

6848.219 --> 6850.88
dude

6859.199 --> 6861.379999999999
foreign

6861.84 --> 6867.599
holy [ __ ]

6864.0 --> 6869.58
I didn't I didn't know

6867.599 --> 6872.76
like this

6869.58 --> 6875.159
I've had a project in my mind for a very

6872.76 --> 6877.139
long time holy [ __ ] it's been out there

6875.159 --> 6879.679
for a long time

6877.139 --> 6879.679
man

6880.08 --> 6885.119
it's crazy

6881.94 --> 6889.919999999999
I had an idea of

6885.119 --> 6892.679
like filtering water on a grand scale

6889.92 --> 6895.5
like on a grand grand scale like an

6892.679 --> 6898.619
entire River how would you do that

6895.5 --> 6902.099
without mechanical moving parts

6898.619 --> 6905.0
that would literally this part deposit

6902.099 --> 6905.0
the waste

6905.219 --> 6910.8
like outside of the region like pooing

6908.28 --> 6913.199
it out without clogging the filter

6910.8 --> 6914.34
system without requiring regular

6913.199 --> 6917.94
maintenance

6914.34 --> 6921.7390000000005
right of this reverse osmosis

6917.94 --> 6921.739
is seems to have already

6922.86 --> 6927.299999999999
yeah that would be very integral part of

6926.099 --> 6929.84
it

6927.3 --> 6929.84
like

6931.199 --> 6936.739
it's fascinating

6933.3 --> 6936.7390000000005
I should read up on this

6954.9 --> 6957.5599999999995
wow

6967.38 --> 6970.38
fascinating

6983.219 --> 6988.04
we could talk about water yeah but I'm

6985.26 --> 6988.04
not going to though

6988.76 --> 6995.159000000001
I am gonna round out the show

6992.4 --> 6998.159
that turned pretty interesting in the

6995.159 --> 6999.299999999999
second half I'd say

6998.159 --> 7002.42
so

6999.3 --> 7005.659000000001
thanks everyone for coming I hope you

7002.42 --> 7007.639

Earth early bird number 908

7036.679 --> 7042.1990000000005
on the Saturday edition so it's going to

7039.5 --> 7046.0
be 2 p.m for those who have trouble

7042.199 --> 7046.0
getting up so early huh

7048.139 --> 7053.84
getting up five o'clock is like really

7050.48 --> 7055.58
early I get it you gotta have a solid

7053.84 --> 7057.76
steady reason to do it otherwise it's

7055.58 --> 7061.46
just not gonna work

7057.76 --> 7063.679
like goats or having a dog that insists

7061.46 --> 7066.199
of being being walked at five o'clock

7063.679 --> 7067.76
every single day right

7066.199 --> 7069.678999999999
anyway

7067.76 --> 7071.42
uh I'm also going to join the Flat Earth

7069.679 --> 7073.46
debates it's just start up any second

7071.42 --> 7076.58
now

7073.46 --> 7079.78
