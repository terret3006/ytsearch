4.009 --> 11.25
good morning welcome to flattered

7.83 --> 16.560000000000002
early-bird number 69 I'm your host

11.25 --> 18.48
Arwen and yeah it's kind of weird just a

16.56 --> 23.358999999999998
few minutes ago it suddenly started

18.48 --> 28.189
hailing out of nowhere so yes first ice

23.359 --> 32.309
from the sky that I've seen for a while

28.189 --> 34.77
did snow somewhere in December so I

32.309 --> 37.73
don't remember it hasn't been like that

34.77 --> 37.730000000000004
for a while so

41.1 --> 50.85
all right so yeah yesterday's hangout

46.16 --> 58.879
something unexpected and highly highly

50.85 --> 61.510000000000005
disappointing hey Randy so

58.879 --> 61.51
that's that

63.42 --> 67.28
no more Jose on this show

76.03 --> 79.65
that's some good footage though

85.43 --> 90.58000000000001
I ran t see your in chat would you like

88.13 --> 90.58
to come on

92.02 --> 94.67999999999999
yeah

105.869 --> 111.57
having been having very extensive

108.78 --> 115.18900000000001
conversation before this with Daniel but

111.57 --> 118.859
same old same openness [ __ ]

115.189 --> 125.85
Daniel is one of the most elaborate most

118.859 --> 128.519
meticulous evader of information that

125.85 --> 131.129
allows him to understand what's really

128.519 --> 132.9
going on that I've ever seen he's

131.129 --> 137.099
literally like a programmed

132.9 --> 140.88
drone that can just replicate fine

137.099 --> 143.81
details but he can never gaze upon never

140.88 --> 146.97
see never understand certain details

143.81 --> 150.65
that would break the model that is his

146.97 --> 153.81
foundation of reality and that is his

150.65 --> 158.94
presupposition for everything probably

153.81 --> 160.739
always will be and yeah talk up 1/4 an

158.94 --> 162.239
hour and he will keep on talking and

160.739 --> 164.19
talking and talking and then he will

162.239 --> 165.989
comment and comment a comment and do the

164.19 --> 168.87
same [ __ ] over and over and over again

165.989 --> 171.0
and he will always praise to his calc

168.87 --> 173.04
curvature calculator and he will never

171.0 --> 175.44
recognize that it's based on an

173.04 --> 178.26
autograph you and thus imagination and

175.44 --> 182.25
proven to be a fraud then he even has

178.26 --> 186.84
the balls pun intended to bring Occam's

182.25 --> 190.26
razor into it Occam's razor does not

186.84 --> 193.44
apply to a the simpler explanation when

190.26 --> 198.84
that simpler explanation is proven to be

193.44 --> 200.14
based on fraud ok Daniel so good luck

198.84 --> 203.20000000000002
with that

200.14 --> 205.6
lol oh hey Randy

203.2 --> 207.54999999999998
good to see you man yeah how's it going

205.6 --> 210.67
I've been better

207.55 --> 213.12
I only caught a very well probably ten

210.67 --> 218.47
minutes of your hangout yesterday with

213.12 --> 227.59
Jose um yeah what was yeah what's his

218.47 --> 232.24
problem problem is is that his conscious

227.59 --> 237.79
his moral Center apparently is

232.24 --> 241.209
undeveloped in certain regions and thus

237.79 --> 245.17
he without any problem to himself so it

241.209 --> 249.75
seems can allow himself to just switch

245.17 --> 255.69
realities in his mind without any moral

249.75 --> 259.87
obstructions as well as disappointing

255.69 --> 261.01
the shows aren't are much um you know I

259.87 --> 264.4
know he's been operating discs or

261.01 --> 266.08
doesn't he with have them priests over

264.4 --> 267.84999999999997
there so you know if you go into the

266.08 --> 272.01
into their cage you're gonna get

267.85 --> 275.26000000000005
brainwashed absolutely and he probably

272.01 --> 278.229
does have his own personal desperation

275.26 --> 280.71999999999997
situations that I speculated it's kind

278.229 --> 283.45
of bad to talk about it now that I'm

280.72 --> 286.24
basically banning him I don't want to

283.45 --> 288.0
join us back to much well I've just had

286.24 --> 290.47
a message from him actually he says that

288.0 --> 292.87
you blocked him from the chats we

290.47 --> 296.95000000000005
currently express himself but it's good

292.87 --> 300.84000000000003
well I would say you can come um my

296.95 --> 300.84
panel one last time if you want

311.999 --> 319.139
and I guess with you hear that I'm fine

315.329 --> 323.309
for letting him but yeah it will be the

319.139 --> 327.17900000000003
last time I guarantee it because I know

323.309 --> 329.42900000000003
exactly where it's going there's only so

327.179 --> 331.60999999999996
many ways to go after you do something

329.429 --> 331.60999999999996
like that

333.12 --> 337.65
well I didn't catch all of it so

334.95 --> 343.94
obviously I'm pretty in the dark with

337.65 --> 350.76
what actually happened well he basically

343.94 --> 354.33
flip-flopped in plain sight and with the

350.76 --> 356.69
delusions and well in this case because

354.33 --> 360.3
he knows better because he's been there

356.69 --> 365.729
he knows that these things are lies and

360.3 --> 367.71000000000004
yet he rests his case on them and that

365.729 --> 370.38
is lying to somebody's face

367.71 --> 376.5
by somebody that should know better and

370.38 --> 379.169
I consider that a vile act almost as

376.5 --> 381.27
vile as just punching a random innocent

379.169 --> 384.44
person in the face on the streets that

381.27 --> 384.44
level of fineness

387.03 --> 394.09
you wanna have a levy on certain them a

391.06 --> 396.58
link yeah Ali would you let's jump on

394.09 --> 398.08
the panel now spoken to you for a while

396.58 --> 400.15
and I'm haven't watched the non sequitur

398.08 --> 404.71
show so be interesting to hear your take

400.15 --> 405.75
on it let us know if you want the link

404.71 --> 410.79999999999995
and I'll pass it over

405.75 --> 413.17
yeah sure you link and so yeah I mean

410.8 --> 425.23
Nathan was on with Patricia steer last

413.17 --> 428.41
night yeah I saw that I knew about it

425.23 --> 432.22
coming up so it was it wasn't really a

428.41 --> 433.81
surprise for me well yeah it was all

432.22 --> 439.45000000000005
good I think he'll be in our show

433.81 --> 442.99
something different yeah it's funny like

439.45 --> 445.78
a while ago after he got attacked by

442.99 --> 448.23
that company on his channel I think I

445.78 --> 451.15
did suggest it like yeah maybe you could

448.23 --> 453.79
while you're still in wait for the

451.15 --> 455.59
channel 2 yeah to be able to restart

453.79 --> 458.34000000000003
with that just team up with some other

455.59 --> 464.15999999999997
people and yeah it's really cool to see

458.34 --> 466.59
him with Patricia that's nice

464.16 --> 469.08000000000004
it was kind of funny though also that

466.59 --> 471.63
Patricia was don't know if she was just

469.08 --> 472.95
playing or acting the part of like yeah

471.63 --> 475.17
I don't understand and then Nathan

472.95 --> 479.09999999999997
explained all these details again and

475.17 --> 480.81
was quite well yeah I mean her audience

479.1 --> 484.38
or more of that fluffy

480.81 --> 487.61
yeah the audience you know so to

484.38 --> 490.26
actually just introduce them to the the

487.61 --> 492.87
the intricacies of this kind of stuff

490.26 --> 494.13
it's you're gonna need to be led into it

492.87 --> 497.34000000000003
so I think yeah you're right Patricia

494.13 --> 498.33
probably did do it that way I think

497.34 --> 500.25
that's good that's how it's gonna be

498.33 --> 502.14
going forward you know she might act

500.25 --> 504.42
like she doesn't know what you was gonna

502.14 --> 506.34
come up with but that's mainly to bring

504.42 --> 508.05
it to her audience I think yeah

506.34 --> 509.96999999999997
don't leave already been in this we know

508.05 --> 511.53000000000003
what's what if we stop that looming and

509.97 --> 513.96
we think everyone knows what looming is

511.53 --> 515.61
and when you find out that people don't

513.96 --> 517.62
actually know what the hell looming it

515.61 --> 519.0600000000001
is or what refraction is and then you

517.62 --> 520.74
know you like that's why I did the Hat

519.06 --> 522.51
that hang out a couple days ago because

520.74 --> 524.64
several people were speaking to me in

522.51 --> 526.02
chat saying oh I saw um jaren's and I

524.64 --> 528.4499999999999
didn't really understand what you meant

526.02 --> 530.6999999999999
about refraction and looming and I'm

528.45 --> 532.5
like I thought I actually probably do

530.7 --> 535.0500000000001
need to do a hangout on this to sort of

532.5 --> 536.46
like explain what their model is because

535.05 --> 540.5999999999999
these people will tune in and watch but

536.46 --> 543.44
they don't actually know what it is Wow

540.6 --> 547.8000000000001
and Allie you've got the link mate yep

543.44 --> 550.5
I've sent the link over yeah you know

547.8 --> 553.65
there there is a cultural issue with

550.5 --> 556.62
optics in general and that is that

553.65 --> 559.65
people never really get taught in school

556.62 --> 561.42
the full picture of optics they get some

559.65 --> 564.3
snippets here and there and they get

561.42 --> 566.76
things like terrestrial refraction just

564.3 --> 568.89
shaft in between there and there's

566.76 --> 573.6
rarely anyone that teaches or that

568.89 --> 576.63
learns the whole thing I never met

573.6 --> 580.2
anyone actually like that that just

576.63 --> 583.23
learns the whole thing this master of

580.2 --> 585.7800000000001
optics through official study channels I

583.23 --> 587.61
don't know any of them and they probably

585.78 --> 590.14
are probably out there and keeping to

587.61 --> 592.54
themselves a lot

590.14 --> 594.88
because they know what their knowledge

592.54 --> 597.76
will wreak on the culture the global

594.88 --> 600.13
culture but nobody ever really gets the

597.76 --> 603.73
full picture in school just get snippets

600.13 --> 606.25
and so everybody's heard some things but

603.73 --> 608.9200000000001
it's only like they they grab this

606.25 --> 611.62
little aspect of little piece of

608.92 --> 613.8389999999999
knowledge that they think is reliable

611.62 --> 616.54
about optics that they've been handed

613.839 --> 620.0500000000001
but they've never really looked into all

616.54 --> 622.42
the workings of optics altogether

620.05 --> 624.79
because you need that to understand

622.42 --> 628.269
which of these things is real and proven

624.79 --> 631.38
and which is just a machination that's

628.269 --> 637.0600000000001
been there to poison the well of

631.38 --> 639.22
knowledge for the people and yet I find

637.06 --> 641.8599999999999
it very interesting to see that happen

639.22 --> 646.0500000000001
every time people will bring forth like

641.86 --> 649.54
little snippets of optics knowledge and

646.05 --> 652.54
rarely anyone really has oversight

649.54 --> 655.63
inside on the complete total functions

652.54 --> 657.67
of optics everything that comes with

655.63 --> 660.76
that with lenses and with a viewing

657.67 --> 662.89
angle and look I don't even know

660.76 --> 666.16
everything about it I've roughly gazed

662.89 --> 671.92
upon it but it is very heavy no it's

666.16 --> 675.16
very big and more complicated than other

671.92 --> 678.519
types of knowledge to conceptualize

675.16 --> 683.5889999999999
what's going on so I'm still learning

678.519 --> 686.68
and a lot of people yet the knowledge is

683.589 --> 689.23
incomplete it seems in the general

686.68 --> 691.66
public it's just totally incomplete look

689.23 --> 696.2090000000001
this way when Sean Hufford did his

691.66 --> 701.3389999999999
little compression sideways compression

696.209 --> 701.3389999999999
of that image taken from the drone

702.48 --> 707.07
they've essentially were lying to the

705.579 --> 709.8389999999999
audience I mean it was barrel distortion

707.07 --> 711.85
we all know that we know what what that

709.839 --> 714.0100000000001
happens they even know that because they

711.85 --> 715.089
would have people that told me about it

714.01 --> 717.9399999999999
about 18 months ago

715.089 --> 720.7600000000001
so to hear all them you know there was

717.94 --> 723.399
slash bar cane Shawn Horford

720.76 --> 724.0
back flat earth team skeptic all those

723.399 --> 726.189
guys

724.0 --> 728.529
all monkey chanting in the back of

726.189 --> 730.779
background curvature when clearly it

728.529 --> 733.6
would just barrel distortion I mean come

730.779 --> 735.73
on is that the best proof they've got is

733.6 --> 740.589
to actually lie about an observation

735.73 --> 743.5600000000001
yeah yeah it is because if they start to

740.589 --> 747.339
really dig into the true optics of the

743.56 --> 751.2399999999999
world of sight itself in any form then

747.339 --> 754.4200000000001
they can't have that convenient

751.24 --> 756.129
primitive approach anymore doesn't mean

754.42 --> 758.5889999999999
it's the childish approach and they

756.129 --> 760.779
don't allow themselves to move beyond

758.589 --> 763.269
that because they don't wanna because

760.779 --> 765.519
then they lose their curvature well the

763.269 --> 767.97
best way to explain it is that if you're

765.519 --> 770.7090000000001
if you're standing in a boat and you

767.97 --> 773.23
turn around you do a full 360-degree

770.709 --> 774.66
movement all the way around see you've

773.23 --> 777.16
gone through north south east and west

774.66 --> 781.29
you've literally turned around in a

777.16 --> 783.73
circle and you have visualized the earth

781.29 --> 785.74
circular it's a circle if you turn

783.73 --> 788.86
around so if you send the drone up

785.74 --> 791.019
higher and it does a 360 it's still

788.86 --> 792.85
seeing a circle it's not seeing squares

791.019 --> 795.43
it's not seeing triangles it's seeing in

792.85 --> 800.23
a circle so if you take a snapshot of

795.43 --> 803.769
the circle and you've got let's say

800.23 --> 806.6800000000001
you've taken a 90 degree snapshot of the

803.769 --> 810.519
circle you have now captured 90 degree

806.68 --> 812.5889999999999
of a circle so when you squash it it is

810.519 --> 817.2090000000001
going to curve because you've captured

812.589 --> 821.019
an image of the circle not anything else

817.209 --> 825.069
it's the heath is it's so stupid what

821.019 --> 830.769
they did and I know Jaron was all over

825.069 --> 831.279
it instantly instantly because it's

830.769 --> 834.639
[ __ ]

831.279 --> 837.55
it really is [ __ ] it always has

834.639 --> 840.519
again the whole grasping grasping yeah

837.55 --> 843.519
but it's it's their trick their trick is

840.519 --> 847.48
not allowing themselves to get the full

843.519 --> 850.149
picture of optics and they must they

847.48 --> 852.429
know this they know yeah there is more

850.149 --> 855.579
out there but as soon as I start to

852.429 --> 857.5799999999999
understand what is out there I can't do

855.579 --> 860.53
this anymore

857.58 --> 863.6700000000001
so they're basically abusing their

860.53 --> 863.67
ignorance willingly

864.93 --> 872.38
it's very sick here's our peepee just

869.11 --> 877.21
gave a shout out to Nate Oakley red pill

872.38 --> 878.53
philosophy yes here did it yeah I've

877.21 --> 880.09
seen that video this morning and

878.53 --> 881.68
actually that that's a really good

880.09 --> 883.72
demonstration I was actually considering

881.68 --> 886.27
stealing that demonstration ended and

883.72 --> 889.0600000000001
perhaps using it myself I have done it

886.27 --> 890.89
with Blackpool Tower I've got an image

889.06 --> 893.7399999999999
of that probably somewhere where I do

890.89 --> 895.18
the same thing I move the flat full tail

893.74 --> 897.4
further away and you've got the angles

895.18 --> 899.62
changing what was showing it on the boat

897.4 --> 901.81
is it's more practical because it's the

899.62 --> 902.8
bolt the goals that people focus on and

901.81 --> 904.27
I think it was a really good

902.8 --> 906.93
demonstration it shows that the

904.27 --> 909.91
relationship between the two angles so

906.93 --> 912.3399999999999
when you're close to the boat and you're

909.91 --> 915.8199999999999
looking from Center up to Center down

912.34 --> 917.98
the angles are probably two to one in

915.82 --> 920.2600000000001
favor of a wider angle at the top

917.98 --> 923.2
smaller angle at the bottom but the

920.26 --> 926.05
further away you go that increases so

923.2 --> 927.94
the wider angle above actually is

926.05 --> 931.4499999999999
probably around about five or six times

927.94 --> 933.85
the high of the angle at the bottom it

931.45 --> 936.6400000000001
grows so what it actually does is it

933.85 --> 937.84
compresses the lower stop and that's

936.64 --> 938.89
actually what we're seeing in the

937.84 --> 942.2800000000001
observations were seeing this

938.89 --> 944.3199999999999
compression over distance and this is

942.28 --> 951.1899999999999
exactly what we're seeing and it is down

944.32 --> 954.21
to the angle it is it always is

951.19 --> 957.46
good morning good afternoon Karen B yeah

954.21 --> 959.08
let's see you where Sally B what's easy

957.46 --> 961.99
just making a copy so they've been in a

959.08 --> 966.82
moment so up below right what's this

961.99 --> 969.73
justice for justice for whole day that's

966.82 --> 971.4100000000001
because I banned him and I'm saying yeah

969.73 --> 973.26
it is just as four hours a day this is

971.41 --> 974.9399999999999
the justice he deserves

973.26 --> 976.83
it is because you just have the

974.94 --> 980.97
disagreement yesterday or is this like

976.83 --> 983.1600000000001
no it's because I've allowed myself to

980.97 --> 986.49
trust him and make him a part of my show

983.16 --> 989.13
because I trusted that he deep down was

986.49 --> 992.13
a an honest and good guy and he turned

989.13 --> 992.7
out to be a long-term liar straight to

992.13 --> 995.64
my face

992.7 --> 998.6700000000001
and he smiled about it and I don't

995.64 --> 1001.16
tolerate that kind of people ever I hate

998.67 --> 1002.9
them in real life if you did something

1001.16 --> 1006.91
like that I would kick you in the

1002.9 --> 1011.39
hospital it's a personal betrayal

1006.91 --> 1014.27
betrayal of energy that I invested you

1011.39 --> 1017.06
know if you do something like that Randy

1014.27 --> 1019.73
I do exactly the same to you yeah I

1017.06 --> 1022.31
wouldn't imagine you do that because I

1019.73 --> 1026.57
would yeah you would have to be insane

1022.31 --> 1028.6699999999998
for that well AJ Emma's just poor didn't

1026.57 --> 1030.08
see that one did you run see no I didn't

1028.67 --> 1032.48
I hope you understand never actually saw

1030.08 --> 1034.57
that Jose was just starting on his

1032.48 --> 1037.1
journey he's just got yourself a p900

1034.57 --> 1039.83
we're just starting to learn the optics

1037.1 --> 1044.5
of things and I don't know what's what's

1039.83 --> 1049.46
happened but essentially he's you know

1044.5 --> 1051.29
50/50 now is it so well he says he's

1049.46 --> 1053.75
questioning he messaged me to say that

1051.29 --> 1054.83
and I asked him is he and I'm just let

1053.75 --> 1058.73
me get it correctly so I don't

1054.83 --> 1061.55
misrepresent white actually said he said

1058.73 --> 1065.72
I said have you gone wild question mark

1061.55 --> 1069.3799999999999
and he's put no questioning what well if

1065.72 --> 1071.8700000000001
you consider saying yeah Flat Earth is a

1069.38 --> 1077.17
belief there is no evidence for it

1071.87 --> 1079.55
that's that's not that okay that's lying

1077.17 --> 1082.5800000000002
looking them says too too much

1079.55 --> 1084.95
obstruction for the Flat Earth well in

1082.58 --> 1088.01
whose opinion because if you've sinned

1084.95 --> 1089.99
red pills philosophies video where it's

1088.01 --> 1093.76
like a Mill Pond and he is seen

1089.99 --> 1095.51
completely flat for 13.7 miles or so

1093.76 --> 1098.15
pretty much the same sort of

1095.51 --> 1100.37
observations to my lighthouse so we're

1098.15 --> 1103.0700000000002
seeing consistency here so I can see the

1100.37 --> 1106.61
same down to the vase he can see the

1103.07 --> 1107.26
same down to the base and yeah I mean

1106.61 --> 1109.6299999999999
where's

1107.26 --> 1113.71
missing curvature there we see a long

1109.63 --> 1115.96
way we see a long way yeah and yeah

1113.71 --> 1118.18
obviously I think there's an awful lot

1115.96 --> 1120.58
of lessons learned for me personally

1118.18 --> 1122.49
when I did the observation from a new

1120.58 --> 1124.6
location that did the video about

1122.49 --> 1126.49
conspiracy capsules all over it because

1124.6 --> 1129.28
it apparently showed curvature while

1126.49 --> 1131.26
blockage by the water what actually

1129.28 --> 1133.84
happened was we had a tidal ball going

1131.26 --> 1135.49
up so then I started looking into tidal

1133.84 --> 1137.5
bores and I started looking into the

1135.49 --> 1139.36
topography of the land underneath the

1137.5 --> 1141.43
water and what that will actually have

1139.36 --> 1144.1899999999998
an effect of doing now if you have a

1141.43 --> 1147.67
drop off for instance you have the

1144.19 --> 1149.56
shallow waters near the shoreline and

1147.67 --> 1151.3600000000001
then you obviously have a drop-off when

1149.56 --> 1153.04
you go into the deep ocean well think

1151.36 --> 1157.33
about it this way when the tides are

1153.04 --> 1160.33
pushing in against that sort of like

1157.33 --> 1163.51
embankment so as it's pushing in it's

1160.33 --> 1165.85
going to be forcing a small hump as it's

1163.51 --> 1167.44
pushing up into the shallows so it's

1165.85 --> 1169.9599999999998
going from the deep you've got a lot of

1167.44 --> 1171.94
water pushing in from the deep into the

1169.96 --> 1175.54
shallows it's going to artificially

1171.94 --> 1177.04
raise the level of the water now it's

1175.54 --> 1180.49
local I don't care if you're looking

1177.04 --> 1183.49
over from one foot or from ten feet that

1180.49 --> 1187.09
is going to cause obstruction right

1183.49 --> 1190.45
that's right yeah look the lights are

1187.09 --> 1195.37
basically water a body of water pushing

1190.45 --> 1198.3300000000002
onto a shore as a whole so yeah that

1195.37 --> 1203.02
will locally cause obstruction

1198.33 --> 1206.56
yeah well it's manipulating the water

1203.02 --> 1208.87
level so when we have absolute stillness

1206.56 --> 1210.94
and this is what we find in when we have

1208.87 --> 1214.09
absolute stillness over a body of water

1210.94 --> 1214.75
it lies flat there is no there is no

1214.09 --> 1216.58
hump

1214.75 --> 1219.13
there's no blockage when we have

1216.58 --> 1220.99
absolutely still water now I filmed it

1219.13 --> 1222.73
and I have video they have taken images

1220.99 --> 1223.96
of it we're seeing that all the people

1222.73 --> 1225.43
are doing it is right a red pill

1223.96 --> 1227.64
philosophy he's done it as well when

1225.43 --> 1229.18
there when the water is absolutely

1227.64 --> 1230.95
stationary

1229.18 --> 1233.5
there's no tide movement there's no

1230.95 --> 1236.44
swell we just see across it lack of like

1233.5 --> 1238.57
a plane and that tells me obviously the

1236.44 --> 1240.13
only reason we get blockage is when

1238.57 --> 1244.12
there's the movement is

1240.13 --> 1246.16
of the water and for the most part 99%

1244.12 --> 1251.05
of the time the ocean is very unstable

1246.16 --> 1253.15
and moving around yep it is and lakes

1251.05 --> 1255.37
are much more reliable in that sense

1253.15 --> 1257.46
because they stay still the only thing

1255.37 --> 1260.02
really moving them around is the wind

1257.46 --> 1262.81
kind of pushes on it but other than that

1260.02 --> 1267.51
yeah it will there's no wind it still

1262.81 --> 1270.97
will be like a perfect mirror naturally

1267.51 --> 1273.97
no waves and it will be absolutely flat

1270.97 --> 1276.49
and it will reflect exactly like if you

1273.97 --> 1281.44
were looking at stuff that was being

1276.49 --> 1284.71
reflected on a flat mirror it's you're

1281.44 --> 1287.0800000000002
not looking in a sphere in a mirror

1284.71 --> 1291.01
sphere that looks very different yeah

1287.08 --> 1295.21
even a slightly curved mirror looks very

1291.01 --> 1297.52
different when you look over it Ali nice

1295.21 --> 1302.04
to see you in mate how you doing gillies

1297.52 --> 1302.04
yeah okay yeah yeah coming through cool

1302.16 --> 1306.4
how does it go on sec I've not actually

1304.48 --> 1308.92
sinned it but I know that he was going

1306.4 --> 1311.02
to be debating that Craig guy from

1308.92 --> 1314.3500000000001
fighting the Flat Earth what did you

1311.02 --> 1316.5
find his arguments were like well I

1314.35 --> 1320.77
he asked me what I thought a gyro was

1316.5 --> 1323.23
and I explained it I explained it what

1320.77 --> 1325.3
it was and then he goes no I don't think

1323.23 --> 1328.1200000000001
younger standard you know I explained

1325.3 --> 1330.01
what it wasn't about a manner and then

1328.12 --> 1331.4499999999998
he went he prowled on for about 10

1330.01 --> 1335.77
minutes repeating exactly what I just

1331.45 --> 1337.66
said seriously gone gone lesson going if

1335.77 --> 1339.85
you couldn't watch and plus another

1337.66 --> 1341.92
thing I was mainly going at 3 o'clock in

1339.85 --> 1345.1899999999998
the morning that was like 5 o'clock

1341.92 --> 1347.17
because he kept Delana well so you can

1345.19 --> 1351.13
see you could see me I'd gave up but I

1347.17 --> 1353.65
just didn't give a crap about the whole

1351.13 --> 1356.6200000000001
thing at all but as I say I stuck to my

1353.65 --> 1359.02
guns yeah they've done the usual thing

1356.62 --> 1361.2099999999998
they've got this catchphrase guys well

1359.02 --> 1363.46
you we all know what it's I don't think

1361.21 --> 1366.25
you understand you don't understand

1363.46 --> 1369.97
that's an old Ravi that's that's how

1366.25 --> 1371.29
they started up here 2015 it's the first

1369.97 --> 1373.6000000000001
response for

1371.29 --> 1375.97
aid kit itself and yeah the wounded

1373.6 --> 1379.4399999999998
globe don't understand

1375.97 --> 1382.63
yeah exactly so but I don't I don't get

1379.44 --> 1385.27
yeah just I just kept on the air the

1382.63 --> 1387.0400000000002
gyroscopes and I talked about about what

1385.27 --> 1390.46
he said because I have a he was and how

1387.04 --> 1392.62
I was explaining the her are jail is

1390.46 --> 1395.29
school actually overcomes gravity even

1392.62 --> 1397.27
can prove her weight because that that

1395.29 --> 1401.08
faint the flyer he's he's a dumbass

1397.27 --> 1405.61
right yeah he thinks he thinks that

1401.08 --> 1408.37
wheat is a force is that way when we're

1405.61 --> 1411.25
all that exactly but I call him nicely

1408.37 --> 1412.81
calming a hope I've got a couple of

1411.25 --> 1416.35
people who start saying i calling fate

1412.81 --> 1418.8999999999999
the fact goth that's that's that's my

1416.35 --> 1421.84
name for them soir you've felt girth you

1418.9 --> 1424.3600000000001
mean yeah girl around the waist you know

1421.84 --> 1429.6399999999999
how you got I got is very straight sides

1424.36 --> 1433.24
is called inflate the fact got odd but

1429.64 --> 1435.01
but he was he was it like so I was

1433.24 --> 1436.75
trying explaining my boat gravity if you

1435.01 --> 1440.02
if you look at her gender score if you

1436.75 --> 1442.84
have a Bengal like CIT attained up to

1440.02 --> 1444.76
eighty pound we a guy breathe we are

1442.84 --> 1449.53
suddenly like done this experiment and

1444.76 --> 1452.53
the eighties about it about centrifugal

1449.53 --> 1455.41
and gyroscopes and he got this little

1452.53 --> 1459.55
kid till left it was like a I think it

1455.41 --> 1461.74
was a twenty kilo spinning wheel on the

1459.55 --> 1463.69
end of a metal bar and he got up to this

1461.74 --> 1464.98
speed and a little boy just ripped it up

1463.69 --> 1468.5700000000002
and that's a gyroscope

1464.98 --> 1472.54
so that tells me that it was overcoming

1468.57 --> 1473.6499999999999
that we are the we a glove a because

1472.54 --> 1475.54
otherwise the guy wouldn't I mean they

1473.65 --> 1478.99
were left that saw this spinning the

1475.54 --> 1480.3999999999999
gyroscope contributed to you know the

1478.99 --> 1482.77
angular momentum I actually calling

1480.4 --> 1484.5400000000002
viewed somehow its light on this a lot

1482.77 --> 1489.03
easier right no science doesn't know how

1484.54 --> 1490.6599999999999
to explain this but he trying to tell me

1489.03 --> 1493.21
Toby Ferry

1490.66 --> 1496.27
science does kind of know how it works

1493.21 --> 1497.8600000000001
where are they going - to vents know

1496.27 --> 1500.8
what they don't know as much about

1497.86 --> 1504.4289999999999
magnetism what I'm what that force

1500.8 --> 1507.399
magnetism as as much as the naw

1504.429 --> 1509.0800000000002
I have a gyroscope over comes out or

1507.399 --> 1510.9089999999999
does one of those who don't know it's

1509.08 --> 1513.639
been pretty well established and I think

1510.909 --> 1516.46
right okay for the angular momentum that

1513.639 --> 1519.9089999999999
basically yeah but it can't understand

1516.46 --> 1523.269
its effect because that happens and the

1519.909 --> 1527.6490000000001
other forces unless it is very abrupt

1523.269 --> 1531.159
very strong slim flee won't affect the

1527.649 --> 1534.279
cycle yeah that is that is kept

1531.159 --> 1536.0800000000002
imprisoned in this in that gyroscope

1534.279 --> 1538.45
system yeah exactly but it cannot

1536.08 --> 1540.49
understand it force will affect it in

1538.45 --> 1542.799
the slightest that's lightning Welling

1540.49 --> 1544.33
wait that's an opposite point so it's

1542.799 --> 1545.559
overcoming gravity that was the whole

1544.33 --> 1547.4499999999998
point of his naked night

1545.559 --> 1550.4189999999999
so all that comes gravity so when they

1547.45 --> 1553.029
were seen that gravity was pulling the

1550.419 --> 1555.73
gyroscope and lane and he was talking

1553.029 --> 1557.529
about pendulous things and he didn't

1555.73 --> 1559.539
even know that the pendulous fiends are

1557.529 --> 1562.119
actually attached physically to the

1559.539 --> 1563.799
gyroscope not the gimbals he don't have

1562.119 --> 1564.1899999999998
a clue what he was talking about right

1563.799 --> 1565.869
right

1564.19 --> 1569.47
but anyway didn't know while they were

1565.869 --> 1571.2099999999998
for yeah I knew yeah no note but he kept

1569.47 --> 1573.1000000000001
he kept he keeps saying I never

1571.21 --> 1575.6490000000001
mentioned the manual once because I

1573.1 --> 1577.24
obviously when I explained it people

1575.649 --> 1580.4799999999998
knew I was talking about late in the new

1577.24 --> 1583.21
life I knew my I knew my subject to a

1580.48 --> 1586.059
very very precise to very high

1583.21 --> 1588.7
understanding but he kept quoting or

1586.059 --> 1590.71
well it says in the manuals that's not

1588.7 --> 1591.82
that plain jealous veins or as his non

1590.71 --> 1597.519
horses there's a difference between

1591.82 --> 1599.23
gravity and a center of gravity yeah I

1597.519 --> 1602.379
was too exactly there's a distinct

1599.23 --> 1606.85
difference no I know I proved it and

1602.379 --> 1610.029
then he he tried to see that a weight is

1606.85 --> 1612.2199999999998
a force which it isn't right it's and I

1610.029 --> 1615.549
had to add to school a money tell no no

1612.22 --> 1619.3890000000001
it's your so-called gravity that gives

1615.549 --> 1621.039
mass it sweet so eligible for exactly

1619.389 --> 1621.789
but he didn't NOLA and that Steve

1621.039 --> 1624.429
McCurry

1621.789 --> 1627.519
it's just a result if the application of

1624.429 --> 1630.909
the force exactly exactly so it's like

1627.519 --> 1632.769
so a mass doesn't in reality that's why

1630.909 --> 1635.95
if we use don't believe in space but

1632.769 --> 1638.32
that's why things a float like a float

1635.95 --> 1640.24
like that because they're obvious later

1638.32 --> 1641.77
then the medium that loves around and

1640.24 --> 1643.78
I'm not talking about buoyancy

1641.77 --> 1645.82
I don't need buoyancy to explain all I

1643.78 --> 1647.56
need is the weight of an object going

1645.82 --> 1650.23
through a medium if you want to talk

1647.56 --> 1652.03
about buoyancy talk about the war but

1650.23 --> 1654.49
regarding when you're talking about the

1652.03 --> 1656.92
air I'm really they use fluid dynamics

1654.49 --> 1659.59
and needle dynamics they see their air

1656.92 --> 1661.77
as like a fluid but we don't have to

1659.59 --> 1665.05
bring in that buoyancy and when when you

1661.77 --> 1666.85
you don't put buoyancy and a creation

1665.05 --> 1669.6699999999998
you don't need that I've got nothing to

1666.85 --> 1671.26
fight you because you're my man and what

1669.67 --> 1673.15
you're doing with it because there is of

1671.26 --> 1675.55
course still the gradient and the

1673.15 --> 1678.94
relative density layers of the different

1675.55 --> 1680.71
air so it's still involved no no and no

1678.94 --> 1683.68
it's not this is the thing Arwen is not

1680.71 --> 1687.3400000000001
because that with me your fellows

1683.68 --> 1690.3700000000001
offically you can argue against buoyancy

1687.34 --> 1692.62
be nipply because it's not about that

1690.37 --> 1694.33
they've got it because the the well

1692.62 --> 1696.6399999999999
that's buoyancy from New York no you're

1694.33 --> 1699.1
bringing ingredients atmosphere all I'm

1696.64 --> 1701.3500000000001
talking about is in deferential between

1699.1 --> 1704.6499999999999
one object and the medium that is going

1701.35 --> 1709.05
through so it's yes not considerable as

1704.65 --> 1712.93
an object in relation to another gas

1709.05 --> 1715.06
well yeah yeah well we flew it you know

1712.93 --> 1717.3700000000001
but could still be considered as like

1715.06 --> 1719.53
this has a different yeah nobody yeah

1717.37 --> 1720.58
yup but yeah that's faith yet density of

1719.53 --> 1723.49
course of course it's a different

1720.58 --> 1726.73
density but no buoyancy no one does not

1723.49 --> 1729.1
know but the buoyancy is the result it

1726.73 --> 1731.53
is what the difference in density does

1729.1 --> 1733.7199999999998
it is the result like weight is the

1731.53 --> 1736.54
result of an apparent force being

1733.72 --> 1740.5
applied to mass thus buoyancy is the

1736.54 --> 1742.6
effect that results of different then

1740.5 --> 1745.9
yeah of different relative densities

1742.6 --> 1747.6399999999999
being in in proximity to each other yeah

1745.9 --> 1749.17
you would have notice it's the result of

1747.64 --> 1750.97
it yeah but you don't need that you

1749.17 --> 1753.79
understand you do it in there why

1750.97 --> 1755.65
wouldn't you do it it's the results you

1753.79 --> 1757.45
know if something's fallen if

1755.65 --> 1762.3400000000001
something's falling through another

1757.45 --> 1766.78
another light of whatever whatever you

1762.34 --> 1769.3
call it it's not buoyant as a it has no

1766.78 --> 1771.05
points yeah it is its limits travel

1769.3 --> 1776.12
through is buoyant compared

1771.05 --> 1777.98
to that object it will be put to

1776.12 --> 1780.6499999999999
equivalence okay a relative higher

1777.98 --> 1782.95
density level in relation to the falling

1780.65 --> 1785.66
object way it's me that's not explained

1782.95 --> 1788.99
I can't really explain what what's in my

1785.66 --> 1791.5400000000002
head why well I've got it in my head and

1788.99 --> 1793.67
I can I just can't explain it properly

1791.54 --> 1796.37
that we don't need buoyancy [ __ ] oh we

1793.67 --> 1798.71
do an object falling right it's the

1796.37 --> 1801.11
result of the weight of it and the

1798.71 --> 1803.75
dangerous oh it did we density Arwen

1801.11 --> 1806.1799999999998
please I know hold on hold on Ally look

1803.75 --> 1809.33
there's two branches of explaining this

1806.18 --> 1811.43
one is using the apparent gravity theory

1809.33 --> 1813.26
and their works and the other one is to

1811.43 --> 1815.3600000000001
using the relative density theory and

1813.26 --> 1819.22
that also works the only difference is

1815.36 --> 1821.87
is that relative density can actually be

1819.22 --> 1824.74
scientifically proven and gravity cannot

1821.87 --> 1832.9699999999998
wait so there's no buoyancy not very a

1824.74 --> 1834.86
danger if she does yeah okay of eight

1832.97 --> 1837.02
but will you listen to me no Leslie to

1834.86 --> 1839.0
pour exactly what I'm seeing get get all

1837.02 --> 1841.01
this mainstream show your hey Darwin

1839.0 --> 1842.54
right what makes a stream [ __ ] what

1841.01 --> 1844.37
you've just repeated to be is a lot of

1842.54 --> 1846.59
mainstream chef why are you talking

1844.37 --> 1849.8
about right well if you give me a chance

1846.59 --> 1853.4599999999998
to speak I'll tell you exactly once it's

1849.8 --> 1859.04
to do if something is falling through a

1853.46 --> 1861.2
substance has it got buoyancy the object

1859.04 --> 1864.5
no it's not so buoyancy is not a

1861.2 --> 1867.38
property of a specific object is is the

1864.5 --> 1869.96
result of the relative densities in

1867.38 --> 1871.8500000000001
approximation to one another like my

1869.96 --> 1875.48
dad's day that a relatively lower

1871.85 --> 1877.8799999999999
density will have buoyant effect applied

1875.48 --> 1879.95
to it yes you have V air density

1877.88 --> 1883.2800000000002
relative to the other will have a

1879.95 --> 1884.54
falling effect applied to it yeah but

1883.28 --> 1887.72
it's got nothing you don't need to bring

1884.54 --> 1890.03
buoyancy enter all you need why not well

1887.72 --> 1892.9
listen well let me explain it all you

1890.03 --> 1896.81
need is a density of of the medium and

1892.9 --> 1898.8500000000001
density of the the object that you're

1896.81 --> 1900.71
going to be putting through that and if

1898.85 --> 1903.83
the density of the object is then

1900.71 --> 1904.909
heavier or denser than the medium it

1903.83 --> 1906.2289999999998
falls through it

1904.909 --> 1907.909
in the story while you wouldn't Boeing

1906.229 --> 1910.159
Sentinel there's no need for that's not

1907.909 --> 1912.739
the end of the story at all because the

1910.159 --> 1916.0700000000002
medium is also being displaced as the

1912.739 --> 1919.009
object falls it is fully fall specific

1916.07 --> 1921.799
way to do that is buoyancy

1919.009 --> 1923.33
nobody is no other way yeah it is yes

1921.799 --> 1926.299
yes do it

1923.33 --> 1928.309
do it take water okay yeah wait for

1926.299 --> 1930.229
George hold on oh no Ali I want to

1928.309 --> 1932.4189999999999
listen to you because this is getting a

1930.229 --> 1936.919
bit annoying here right okay I'll tell

1932.419 --> 1938.8690000000001
you honey please fully because I'm not

1936.919 --> 1944.96
the age I'm gonna go before you kick me

1938.869 --> 1947.4789999999998
really I'm not kicking you know let me

1944.96 --> 1951.95
explain something please no p1 because

1947.479 --> 1954.019
you you would you would even right I

1951.95 --> 1956.1490000000001
think you'll forget a subject because

1954.019 --> 1959.629
we're not gonna get e here we sell them

1956.149 --> 1962.33
if you listen no but you're not Larry

1959.629 --> 1965.4789999999998
it's necessary and I'm trying to explain

1962.33 --> 1967.4789999999998
to you why it is but I'm explaining to

1965.479 --> 1973.19
you why it's not necessary

1967.479 --> 1974.749
that's always you sense could it be

1973.19 --> 1977.45
possible that you have like a two-minute

1974.749 --> 1978.619
chat each and then respond to each other

1977.45 --> 1980.21
that way rather than didn't keep

1978.619 --> 1983.299
interrupting each other but might be

1980.21 --> 1985.549
better no yeah I saw you slamming I'm

1983.299 --> 1988.07
not barging I just keep my CDs to myself

1985.549 --> 1990.2
because as I see I'm not really bored

1988.07 --> 1992.629
about it that's I've explained what my

1990.2 --> 1993.82
my stance and almonds explains I know

1992.629 --> 1995.299
what Arbenz

1993.82 --> 1996.95
explanation because that's the

1995.299 --> 2002.4089999999999
mainstreaming explanation so I don't

1996.95 --> 2004.479
know if even without you're just quoting

2002.409 --> 2006.1290000000001
water as and mainstream outgoing I'm

2004.479 --> 2010.509
going to wake up India I know they'll

2006.129 --> 2016.09
repeat exactly on this absolute I can

2010.509 --> 2018.099
bring out myself okay no Wikipedia

2016.09 --> 2020.559
nothing will ask me I don't have it in

2018.099 --> 2023.019
front of me but you've you've left not

2020.559 --> 2025.69
what boy see us through leading me and a

2023.019 --> 2027.669
fancy an effect that's not how its

2025.69 --> 2030.999
declared mainstream and I'm trying to

2027.669 --> 2033.8790000000001
explain to you why it is supposed to be

2030.999 --> 2035.769
accounted for it's not quite how can I

2033.879 --> 2036.9299999999998
give an example it's just gonna get of

2035.769 --> 2040.44
course you can two minutes

2036.93 --> 2042.5700000000002
I call him alright so I'm gonna I'm

2040.44 --> 2044.6100000000001
gonna sort of do a Reilly but not with a

2042.57 --> 2046.32
floating AK in this case because I'm not

2044.61 --> 2049.2
trying to prove relative density I'm

2046.32 --> 2053.52
just trying to show you that buoyancy

2049.2 --> 2057.35
occurs when something Falls how how do

2053.52 --> 2060.48
you do this you take a medium an

2057.35 --> 2064.23
aquarium a tube of glass you put water

2060.48 --> 2066.9900000000002
in it you put oil in it okay well if you

2064.23 --> 2069.6
let this settle obviously the oil is

2066.99 --> 2071.25
gonna settle in an exact layer over the

2069.6 --> 2073.98
water because it's relative density is

2071.25 --> 2076.92
lower than the other so now there's this

2073.98 --> 2079.35
division you take a rock or something

2076.92 --> 2082.26
else that's obviously much denser than

2079.35 --> 2085.5899999999997
both the water and the oil you drop it

2082.26 --> 2088.92
in there guess what's gonna happen the

2085.59 --> 2092.6400000000003
entire thing wherever the rock passes is

2088.92 --> 2095.04
gonna be moved up first the oil will

2092.64 --> 2097.74
visibly move up a notch then when it

2095.04 --> 2101.72
approaches the water then the water line

2097.74 --> 2104.0099999999998
moves up it might also be yes certainly

2101.72 --> 2105.0899999999997
distorted like going through each other

2104.01 --> 2106.53
because there's turbulence but

2105.09 --> 2109.53
eventually they'll settle when the rock

2106.53 --> 2113.28
goes down now both the oil and the water

2109.53 --> 2117.3900000000003
line will have moved up which means that

2113.28 --> 2120.69
as the rock went through it it showed a

2117.39 --> 2124.3199999999997
buoyancy effect by displacing upwards as

2120.69 --> 2126.9
the rock has displaced downwards for

2124.32 --> 2129.51
every action there's an opposite and

2126.9 --> 2132.51
equal reaction when it comes to

2129.51 --> 2134.8100000000004
displacement for every fall there is a

2132.51 --> 2136.98
buoyancy

2134.81 --> 2140.5499999999997
otherwise there could be no displacement

2136.98 --> 2142.86
if there's nothing to be this place

2140.55 --> 2146.3900000000003
through buoyancy upwards then something

2142.86 --> 2149.4900000000002
cannot displace by falling downwards

2146.39 --> 2152.6099999999997
that's the thing okay I'm done

2149.49 --> 2153.66
do you understand yeah I know exactly so

2152.61 --> 2155.58
of course I know exactly what your

2153.66 --> 2158.24
symbol but you're calling displacement

2155.58 --> 2160.2
buoyancy when it's two different things

2158.24 --> 2161.64
displacements not buoyancy that's why

2160.2 --> 2164.97
those two different words for the r-1

2161.64 --> 2168.5699999999997
now what the buoyancy is the the way it

2164.97 --> 2170.37
displaces like a fall a falling thing is

2168.57 --> 2173.67
away something display

2170.37 --> 2178.41
displacement is only the moving buoyancy

2173.67 --> 2181.5
is being pushed upwards falling is being

2178.41 --> 2185.43
pushed downwards that's really the only

2181.5 --> 2188.58
difference why are you guys going wait

2185.43 --> 2190.2
why are you using what's pushing a pool

2188.58 --> 2192.0
and I'll push or pull what I believe

2190.2 --> 2193.98
nothing that's not really relevant when

2192.0 --> 2196.11
this when something is displacement if

2193.98 --> 2198.33
yeah bring pushing down where it doesn't

2196.11 --> 2200.09
matter it's not relevant if placement is

2198.33 --> 2203.64
not buoyancy that's the fight

2200.09 --> 2206.61
what displacement is not buoyancy so

2203.64 --> 2208.29
it's like so that's right energy if I

2206.61 --> 2210.3
punch the table right if I punch the

2208.29 --> 2212.22
table the energy would spray though

2210.3 --> 2213.03
displace it doesn't mean the math Fest

2212.22 --> 2215.1299999999997
is boring

2213.03 --> 2217.6200000000003
it's totally you're mixing up to water

2215.13 --> 2222.42
you know man it's not enough buoyancy is

2217.62 --> 2225.0899999999997
always upwards as falling is always

2222.42 --> 2227.61
downwards never side words falling is no

2225.09 --> 2229.82
buoyancy buoyancy is always upwards

2227.61 --> 2235.04
never downwards something doesn't point

2229.82 --> 2235.04
downwards that's that's the whole point

2235.19 --> 2241.61
displacement may not be per default

2237.96 --> 2245.13
buoyancy but buoyancy is displacement

2241.61 --> 2248.25
falling or displacement is not falling

2245.13 --> 2252.51
there is more forms of displacement but

2248.25 --> 2254.67
falling is displacement yeah and I agree

2252.51 --> 2257.28
with I totally agree with yes but it's

2254.67 --> 2258.4500000000003
not point it's no buoyancy I will bring

2257.28 --> 2260.01
another segment

2258.45 --> 2262.68
you know describing something totally

2260.01 --> 2264.78
different yeah that's because it's a

2262.68 --> 2267.1499999999996
different effect well exactly is

2264.78 --> 2268.92
displacement but that's what I'm talking

2267.15 --> 2271.89
about that's what I'm talking about its

2268.92 --> 2276.0
buoyancy is not displacement it doesn't

2271.89 --> 2278.8799999999997
it's nothing no displacement may not

2276.0 --> 2282.08
necessarily be buoyancy but buoyancy is

2278.88 --> 2284.9100000000003
in the form of displacement yes it is

2282.08 --> 2288.0
no no what I just read it in my example

2284.91 --> 2290.37
your but your your can fleet you're

2288.0 --> 2292.89
putting two things together of good so

2290.37 --> 2295.08
what is each other if it's not buoyancy

2292.89 --> 2299.31
then what is that mode I just told

2295.08 --> 2302.19
medium upwards of what medium upwards

2299.31 --> 2304.77
yeah the water the oil that the

2302.19 --> 2307.7400000000002
rock past true what is that effect that

2304.77 --> 2310.14
it is moving upwards what is it what you

2307.74 --> 2311.5499999999997
would say I'll call that right okay well

2310.14 --> 2314.1
you don't get you don't call that

2311.55 --> 2315.4500000000003
buoyancy all that it should I call it

2314.1 --> 2318.15
right wait a minute listen it's not

2315.45 --> 2320.0699999999997
upwards at all it's in a three if you

2318.15 --> 2324.12
drop something for what others are force

2320.07 --> 2328.11
those are displacement 360 degrees

2324.12 --> 2330.42
around the object not answering my

2328.11 --> 2332.84
question what should I call it then that

2330.42 --> 2335.82
upward displacement

2332.84 --> 2336.03
well no buoyancy then what should I call

2335.82 --> 2338.04
it

2336.03 --> 2340.0800000000004
I don't know me a cup of [ __ ] Nino

2338.04 --> 2341.64
I'm gonna call it buoyancy because

2340.08 --> 2343.65
that's what everyone calls it that's

2341.64 --> 2346.02
what is good that was the designated to

2343.65 --> 2348.39
that effects but it's got nothing to do

2346.02 --> 2351.99
it's got nothing to do when object

2348.39 --> 2353.8199999999997
falling through the ear that's got

2351.99 --> 2356.3999999999996
nothing to do with buoyancy if it falls

2353.82 --> 2359.4300000000003
it's heavier than the medium and so all

2356.4 --> 2362.36
as is about that the easiest way spleen

2359.43 --> 2365.85
what as an object will fall through

2362.36 --> 2367.6200000000003
medium that is less dense than itself

2365.85 --> 2369.99
that's really no and you're perfectly

2367.62 --> 2372.63
correct from a perspective that only

2369.99 --> 2374.43
focuses on the off falling object but

2372.63 --> 2377.25
when you actually want to account the

2374.43 --> 2380.1
entire medium in which the displacement

2377.25 --> 2383.04
takes place you have to account for the

2380.1 --> 2385.5299999999997
medium that it itself moves up

2383.04 --> 2387.56
simultaneously for every reaction

2385.53 --> 2391.77
there's an opposite and equal reaction

2387.56 --> 2395.73
sorry okay so fitness and why isn't

2391.77 --> 2399.63
buoyancy why is it a buoyancy and the

2395.73 --> 2406.08
gravity equation then why is your

2399.63 --> 2409.8
displacement no angle everything well my

2406.08 --> 2412.86
heart is they actually do use that in

2409.8 --> 2416.2200000000003
with architecture with the gravity based

2412.86 --> 2419.42
law of calculating things yeah they do

2416.22 --> 2422.4599999999996
gravity puts here so they say and

2419.42 --> 2424.5
buoyancy is the lighter things moving

2422.46 --> 2427.5
the opposite the opposite reaction they

2424.5 --> 2431.48
actually do do that within the gravity

2427.5 --> 2434.67
approach I learned that in school okay

2431.48 --> 2436.349
well you've been taught about well

2434.67 --> 2437.849
you've been indoctrinated they're not me

2436.349 --> 2440.19
because you don't need to tell me that

2437.849 --> 2442.65
but will they do like are you for it

2440.19 --> 2444.66
it's all I'm saying but why are you

2442.65 --> 2447.21
coordinating late listen you should

2444.66 --> 2448.6499999999996
listen to what you just said I love my

2447.21 --> 2450.119
school so it must be right

2448.65 --> 2452.369
no baby no that's not what I'm saying

2450.119 --> 2455.4300000000003
one of your audience it was accounted

2452.369 --> 2458.099
for not that I believe that said right

2455.43 --> 2461.49
so when you can be with me gravity

2458.099 --> 2463.8
relative density yes what do you matter

2461.49 --> 2465.66
the difference is relative density can

2463.8 --> 2468.0890000000004
be scientifically proven and gravity

2465.66 --> 2468.569
cannot but they're practically the same

2468.089 --> 2473.22
thing

2468.569 --> 2476.64
and falling and buoyancy are both part

2473.22 --> 2479.43
of both systems in the same way pretty

2476.64 --> 2484.17
much it's just relative density just

2479.43 --> 2488.52
tight and tangle it tangles it Tango's

2484.17 --> 2490.98
with the cause that's a fascist okay if

2488.52 --> 2493.23
I wrote just puts the little G in the

2490.98 --> 2495.359
formula that's like what what they do

2493.23 --> 2497.76
all right here we go that night so if I

2495.359 --> 2505.95
wrote an equation see I had a killing a

2497.76 --> 2508.38
kill bar of a 250 gram bar of hashish I

2505.95 --> 2510.18
would find out the density of that right

2508.38 --> 2512.4300000000003
then I would look at the medium that was

2510.18 --> 2515.43
gonna go through right and I would see

2512.43 --> 2518.46
rate okay then that's heavier than that

2515.43 --> 2520.109
so that's got less il that contains lacy

2518.46 --> 2521.9700000000003
up which makes things for that contains

2520.109 --> 2523.77
lacy up because it's more dense so

2521.97 --> 2525.7799999999997
therefore it will drop to the bottom and

2523.77 --> 2527.849
nowhere than that a creation would you

2525.78 --> 2530.4300000000003
have to put in there buoyancy there to

2527.849 --> 2534.3590000000004
hang for buoyancy all you're doing is in

2530.43 --> 2537.0299999999997
density density presumes density of

2534.359 --> 2539.0099999999998
medium right only if you're gonna drop

2537.03 --> 2541.829
it say in aquarium filled with a liquid

2539.01 --> 2544.4300000000003
would be handy to take in account for

2541.829 --> 2547.38
how much that liquid is gonna be arrays

2544.43 --> 2550.0789999999997
otherwise it might overflow it you know

2547.38 --> 2552.119
so you do have to account for buoyancy

2550.079 --> 2554.819
no but ice displacement no buoyancy is

2552.119 --> 2557.94
got nothing at all we do warm water

2554.819 --> 2561.0
rising do you have a allergy for the

2557.94 --> 2561.9
word buoyancy cuz this sounds very very

2561.0 --> 2564.6
familiar

2561.9 --> 2567.1800000000003
pattern here right okay that's that's

2564.6 --> 2569.0699999999997
that's a it sounds exciting

2567.18 --> 2571.74
well let you know were displaced of the

2569.07 --> 2573.84
word away that Slade what you done Lily

2571.74 --> 2576.81
I'll let that slide me well I'm sorry

2573.84 --> 2580.4100000000003
but I wanted you I psychologically

2576.81 --> 2583.23
analyzed anyone as I psychologically but

2580.41 --> 2584.94
but that's fine that's fine but that's

2583.23 --> 2588.33
why I said that waited the [ __ ] off in

2584.94 --> 2590.61
fact uh as I said when there was

2588.33 --> 2593.37
absolutely no point you proved your

2590.61 --> 2594.8700000000003
colors yest of the piece I cut out when

2593.37 --> 2598.8199999999997
you talk to you who is he like that

2594.87 --> 2602.22
there's a guy drama tying skewer guy you

2598.82 --> 2605.1000000000004
doing you're a piece of crap you taught

2602.22 --> 2607.5899999999997
him hell he lied to my face the

2605.1 --> 2610.2599999999998
moonlight to your face he never liked

2607.59 --> 2611.1600000000003
him I he did he never do told me one he

2610.26 --> 2615.03
lied to everyone

2611.16 --> 2617.64
never from the bow how are you from the

2615.03 --> 2619.17
get-go laugh coming on my show asking

2617.64 --> 2621.5699999999997
for an invite and then calling me a

2619.17 --> 2623.9
piece of crap who the hell do you think

2621.57 --> 2627.03
you are no you didn't say it's me on

2623.9 --> 2628.8
nothing but not to do that [ __ ] alright

2627.03 --> 2632.1200000000003
okay know what shut well I'm just

2628.8 --> 2635.67
getting the [ __ ] off piss off [ __ ]

2632.12 --> 2638.27
and keep your [ __ ] word allergies to

2635.67 --> 2645.2000000000003
yourself at the same time thank you

2638.27 --> 2645.2
it's a complete [ __ ] what the [ __ ]

2647.55 --> 2651.21
it's ridiculous

2651.85 --> 2660.67
okay I didn't treat Jose bad yesterday

2657.12 --> 2664.3599999999997
ever feel to himself as a two-faced

2660.67 --> 2668.35
snake and he was laughing about it okay

2664.36 --> 2670.51
I treat them exactly how they deserve

2668.35 --> 2672.31
and I'm gonna treat you exactly how you

2670.51 --> 2675.1600000000003
deserve and if you're gonna get nutty

2672.31 --> 2677.23
then I will point that out I don't

2675.16 --> 2680.3199999999997
dislike you I don't hate you but you do

2677.23 --> 2682.3
get a little weird now and then and this

2680.32 --> 2686.5
is one of those moments and yeah I will

2682.3 --> 2689.02
point it out exactly how it is so sorry

2686.5 --> 2691.48
dude that I insulted you you I'm not

2689.02 --> 2693.46
saying that you're banned now but you

2691.48 --> 2695.68
got to contain yourself here you can't

2693.46 --> 2697.93
come on my show and call me a piece of

2695.68 --> 2702.27
crap I should ban you for this

2697.93 --> 2702.27
permanently what I'm not because I know

2702.99 --> 2709.7799999999997
that inside you don't really have a bad

2706.0 --> 2712.41
intention and you feel that I may have

2709.78 --> 2715.0
wronged somebody that you care about

2712.41 --> 2717.46
well you have to realize that he's the

2715.0 --> 2720.34
one that wronged me and you and everyone

2717.46 --> 2725.25
and you're still in a position where

2720.34 --> 2725.25
you're unable to accept what he's done

2727.71 --> 2732.96
yeah now I can kick them ranty sorry you

2731.19 --> 2734.73
feel that way but if he's gonna call me

2732.96 --> 2738.089
a piece of crap on my show that I don't

2734.73 --> 2740.13
tolerate that [ __ ] you know especially

2738.089 --> 2747.599
if I ask him to stop and he keeps doing

2740.13 --> 2750.53
it you know sorry sorry if you don't

2747.599 --> 2750.53
like that Randy

2767.74 --> 2773.8489999999997
so ya know what the point here is where

2772.15 --> 2779.83
everybody's getting pissed off at me for

2773.849 --> 2781.42
treating horsy like this okay do you

2779.83 --> 2785.17
even know what's going on you think it's

2781.42 --> 2787.51
all a joke something it's like oh it's

2785.17 --> 2790.839
perfectly okay to just flip flop in

2787.51 --> 2794.23
plain sight and you know people trusted

2790.839 --> 2798.369
you to basically be truthful about

2794.23 --> 2801.94
things you know you're just gonna do it

2798.369 --> 2804.42
just like that and not even admit some

2801.94 --> 2804.42
kind of

2805.11 --> 2811.32
more real conception of what you're

2807.39 --> 2814.47
doing it's just not okay you know and

2811.32 --> 2816.56
I'm sensitive for that kind of [ __ ] no

2814.47 --> 2820.8799999999997
that hurts me a lot

2816.56 --> 2820.88
outrageous me a great deal

2829.2 --> 2832.04
Nicholas

2836.78 --> 2842.4300000000003
great a lot of great panel

2840.03 --> 2845.15
confrontations these days and I know

2842.43 --> 2845.1499999999996
what the hell's wrong

2850.92 --> 2855.75
maybe I'm losing my patience maybe I'm

2853.92 --> 2860.25
just really losing my patience with

2855.75 --> 2864.18
people here in general I don't know what

2860.25 --> 2867.93
it is but you know you can be on here

2864.18 --> 2870.12
you can have weird opinions and can even

2867.93 --> 2874.95
be pissed off if I interrupt you and

2870.12 --> 2876.72
that's yeah I can say that and I agree

2874.95 --> 2879.6299999999997
it can be annoying when I do that but

2876.72 --> 2880.74
you can't come in here and then call me

2879.63 --> 2884.7000000000003
a piece of [ __ ] okay

2880.74 --> 2888.6299999999997
never ever there's no justification for

2884.7 --> 2892.71
that ever right so as long as you get

2888.63 --> 2895.38
that then there's no problem and if you

2892.71 --> 2897.06
feel you need to rant and rave on me for

2895.38 --> 2900.09
something that you feel I done that is

2897.06 --> 2903.84
really wrong leave it in a in a message

2900.09 --> 2905.52
you know but you don't come on my show

2903.84 --> 2908.57
live and then do that

2905.52 --> 2908.57
just don't

2913.92 --> 2916.52
yes

2944.22 --> 2950.8289999999997
yeah

2945.9 --> 2952.509
well let me read dress chat for a moment

2950.829 --> 2955.299
here I have a theory

2952.509 --> 2958.18
that's it's not even my own theory

2955.299 --> 2962.069
really because it didn't paid that much

2958.18 --> 2965.68
attention that Jose has a very very

2962.069 --> 2969.0389999999998
severe allergy for anything that is

2965.68 --> 2971.499
spiritual and since I have entire

2969.039 --> 2974.0490000000004
episodes where I talk great in great

2971.499 --> 2980.3799999999997
detail about the path and all these

2974.049 --> 2982.569
things well people that told me about

2980.38 --> 2984.9990000000003
him said yeah yeah that really allergic

2982.569 --> 2988.869
response so he's trying to sabotage me

2984.999 --> 2991.1189999999997
indeed doing it anyway Ken and know he

2988.869 --> 2993.5190000000002
is and that's great and now everybody

2991.119 --> 2997.38
people like Ali are like oh what are you

2993.519 --> 3002.66
doing to hojae how dare you do this

2997.38 --> 3005.759
he started by basically lying to my face

3002.66 --> 3010.68
for a long time and smiling about it

3005.759 --> 3012.2690000000002
when he reveals it right and yeah I

3010.68 --> 3014.989
don't accept that

3012.269 --> 3014.9889999999996
I just don't

3018.69 --> 3023.48
yeah you know trolls will do what trolls

3021.15 --> 3027.81
do and they will always do what they do

3023.48 --> 3031.43
but I didn't see Jose as a troll I saw

3027.81 --> 3036.2999999999997
him as a as an ally as an actual friend

3031.43 --> 3041.54
that I could trust to his word and I

3036.3 --> 3043.53
acted on that and he just betrayed me

3041.54 --> 3047.7
betrayed my trust

3043.53 --> 3050.2400000000002
and yeah I'm not just gonna let that

3047.7 --> 3053.8399999999997
happen like nothing has ever happened

3050.24 --> 3053.8399999999997
it's very simple

3067.68 --> 3070.19
right

3070.25 --> 3076.07
it's a kind of a downer note here it

3073.97 --> 3078.1699999999996
helped to have a more interesting

3076.07 --> 3082.6400000000003
conversation although yeah I did really

3078.17 --> 3084.5
appreciate Ally be coming on and I hope

3082.64 --> 3086.33
he will consider coming back and he's

3084.5 --> 3091.52
not gonna have a grudge now for the rest

3086.33 --> 3092.96
of the year or something because I don't

3091.52 --> 3095.03
think he is a bad guy

3092.96 --> 3098.66
okay I think he gets confused sometimes

3095.03 --> 3101.63
but he's not bad and I did like his

3098.66 --> 3104.27
challenge to me to basically prove that

3101.63 --> 3107.27
buoyancy is not necessary in his view

3104.27 --> 3109.7
and I yeah I took that challenge and I

3107.27 --> 3111.71
showed him why I think that's not the

3109.7 --> 3114.0499999999997
case and everything that ties in with

3111.71 --> 3118.369
that that's what I do I like it I like a

3114.05 --> 3120.71
challenge and yeah maybe I do become a

3118.369 --> 3122.63
little bit more passionate than I should

3120.71 --> 3124.849
be in the process and he might have

3122.63 --> 3127.13
taken offense to that and I'm sorry look

3124.849 --> 3131.4500000000003
okay I'm passionate guy I'm not perfect

3127.13 --> 3133.9700000000003
I try to be very strict but sometimes

3131.45 --> 3136.839
yeah my frustrations leak through as

3133.97 --> 3141.6899999999996
well and I'm sorry if they bothered you

3136.839 --> 3143.67
didn't mean to so

3141.69 --> 3148.319
yeah but I did think it was a good

3143.67 --> 3149.88
conversation and I'm also sorry that

3148.319 --> 3153.599
Randy drop would have been cool if you

3149.88 --> 3156.5
would have gotten on but yeah Randy you

3153.599 --> 3159.7400000000002
gotta realize look if somebody's gonna

3156.5 --> 3163.619
call you a piece of [ __ ] on your show

3159.74 --> 3165.569
you can't be seriously expecting me to

3163.619 --> 3169.92
just leave that on and just sit there

3165.569 --> 3171.66
watching see hear him say that like four

3169.92 --> 3179.789
times in a row okay

3171.66 --> 3181.44
you can't be serious Randy and I'm

3179.789 --> 3186.1800000000003
actually kind of disappointed that you

3181.44 --> 3188.13
didn't step in to stop him because you

3186.18 --> 3193.77
know this is just wrong and somebody

3188.13 --> 3197.4300000000003
does that but you basically drew him in

3193.77 --> 3200.43
the show okay why didn't you speak up

3197.43 --> 3201.5989999999997
like ally stop this stop doing this why

3200.43 --> 3206.24
didn't you say anything

3201.599 --> 3206.2400000000002
why didn't just let him you know

3211.96 --> 3216.88
yeah piece of crap piece of [ __ ] it's

3214.84 --> 3219.69
the same dude that's really laughing

3216.88 --> 3219.69
it's all semantics

3228.13 --> 3234.759
hey Constance see you in chat it's a lot

3233.17 --> 3236.65
of chatting going on that's not

3234.759 --> 3240.209
surprising that's all the friction

3236.65 --> 3240.2090000000003
happening oh my god

3249.15 --> 3252.44
now I'm not burning bridges

3252.7 --> 3259.8999999999996
but people sabotaging [ __ ] people

3257.349 --> 3263.53
dumping their crap my side of the bridge

3259.9 --> 3265.42
I will take their crap and shove it

3263.53 --> 3267.67
right back in their face and kick them

3265.42 --> 3269.589
in the ass and tell them to put it on

3267.67 --> 3272.4900000000002
their own damn side that's what I'll do

3269.589 --> 3272.49
I don't burn the bridge

3279.0 --> 3282.35
so let's see

3285.75 --> 3294.57
whoa that's raining it's not snowing

3290.91 --> 3297.2599999999998
this time so yeah there's some really

3294.57 --> 3300.7400000000002
weird [ __ ] going on everywhere

3297.26 --> 3300.7400000000002
what's happening

3329.61 --> 3337.59
yes yeah I don't know I think I maybe

3333.75 --> 3342.12
even bit I'm a slightly just disturbed

3337.59 --> 3343.9500000000003
by Randy leaving like that I hoped that

3342.12 --> 3347.16
he would

3343.95 --> 3348.6899999999996
reflect me happening maybe on the show

3347.16 --> 3351.39
tell me like why did you do that you

3348.69 --> 3353.9
know I'm okay with talking about that

3351.39 --> 3359.93
and I I'd explain it to him

3353.9 --> 3362.17
why explain it anyway but

3359.93 --> 3365.16
you know why you have to

3362.17 --> 3365.16
dude you know

3386.27 --> 3388.93
so

3391.91 --> 3399.1299999999997
oh yeah that was crazy by the way

3395.36 --> 3404.7290000000003
some weirdo a Dutch guy

3399.13 --> 3404.7290000000003
seem to have threatened me in jet

3407.84 --> 3413.26
Patricia's hangout that was freaky but

3413.43 --> 3416.6299999999997
write me at all

3433.96 --> 3436.96
hmm

3437.45 --> 3441.4399999999996
yeah the pressure seems to be coming

3439.849 --> 3446.089
from all sides they must be doing

3441.44 --> 3448.28
something right because otherwise

3446.089 --> 3451.069
yeah these maniacal people wouldn't be

3448.28 --> 3454.3390000000004
doing stepping up their pressure as well

3451.069 --> 3457.0589999999997
so I'll just be doing exactly what I do

3454.339 --> 3457.0589999999997
and

3460.42 --> 3466.06
some ways guys

3463.63 --> 3471.3900000000003
and look I am really trying to be more

3466.06 --> 3471.39
tolerant all my shows but

3472.22 --> 3477.6189999999997
I guess I'm just naturally not that

3474.53 --> 3482.7200000000003
tolerant overall so there's only so much

3477.619 --> 3486.53
I can handle and when I get outraged and

3482.72 --> 3489.859
there's no proper response then I yeah

3486.53 --> 3492.6800000000003
normally I would typically walk away for

3489.859 --> 3495.65
somebody gets hurt but I can't really do

3492.68 --> 3498.14
that on the show so I just kick him I'm

3495.65 --> 3500.4100000000003
not gonna kick myself you know it's my

3498.14 --> 3500.41
show

3512.44 --> 3516.27
yeah you guys are right

3521.849 --> 3525.17
holy Wow

3529.6 --> 3534.7
yeah I think I'm gonna round out the

3532.15 --> 3538.83
show a little bit early it's not a very

3534.7 --> 3541.839
happy note to round it out on but in

3538.83 --> 3543.3289999999997
Washington our

3541.839 --> 3548.489
you're rounding out in a few minutes

3543.329 --> 3548.489
let's see what about the same chef

3575.81 --> 3578.41
yeah

3600.14 --> 3602.68
huh

3604.79 --> 3613.15
okay lien

3607.42 --> 3614.89
that's pretty every question I have no

3613.15 --> 3623.4700000000003
idea how to respond to that question

3614.89 --> 3626.2599999999998
it's a good one but yeah electrostatic

3623.47 --> 3630.16
field look I don't really know I have

3626.26 --> 3633.25
never seen really in the graphs that I

3630.16 --> 3636.21
felt I could trust about the

3633.25 --> 3639.609
electrostatic field on the earth really

3636.21 --> 3641.849
I'd I'd have to look through that date

3639.609 --> 3641.8489999999997
and

3643.099 --> 3646.25
snowing again

3656.19 --> 3661.41
yeah I left the Irwin because

3657.869 --> 3663.3900000000003
essentially that's two days on the truck

3661.41 --> 3667.8289999999997
that you've you know kick people out

3663.39 --> 3669.45
come on you've got a debate show you've

3667.829 --> 3670.8900000000003
got a chat show you can't just be

3669.45 --> 3675.569
kicking people out all the time

3670.89 --> 3677.2799999999997
oh really you can do you could do

3675.569 --> 3678.24
anything it's your own show it's your

3677.28 --> 3680.0690000000004
own show you can do what the hell you

3678.24 --> 3684.8289999999997
like I'm just saying you know it doesn't

3680.069 --> 3687.72
look good okay away well where was that

3684.829 --> 3690.21
that angle of approach really in

3687.72 --> 3695.22
Nathan's show because that happened a

3690.21 --> 3696.69
lot only to the trolls all right oh if

3695.22 --> 3698.22
somebody's gonna be for the most part

3696.69 --> 3699.7200000000003
people come in and they called a snork

3698.22 --> 3701.069
answer names and he just puts up with it

3699.72 --> 3702.569
just lets him get on with it and then

3701.069 --> 3707.19
other people join in and then that's

3702.569 --> 3709.95
that all right well you know if a global

3707.19 --> 3710.67
would come on and behave like that well

3709.95 --> 3714.3289999999997
that's different

3710.67 --> 3717.15
you know but I consider an ally as a

3714.329 --> 3720.42
good guy sort of like a friend maybe not

3717.15 --> 3723.119
very close but yeah for him to do like

3720.42 --> 3726.119
that it's just it's just out of place

3723.119 --> 3728.52
you know well I think he was he was more

3726.119 --> 3735.359
upset that you the way you've blocked

3728.52 --> 3739.14
our holiday right you know I mean you

3735.359 --> 3741.69
know oK you've had a disagreement but to

3739.14 --> 3744.5389999999998
block him from talking in the chat so I

3741.69 --> 3745.77
can't explain these his reasons or

3744.539 --> 3747.539
what's going through his head at the

3745.77 --> 3750.809
minute I mean we don't really know I may

3747.539 --> 3754.7400000000002
about it okay I can't I can't stand to

3750.809 --> 3757.6800000000003
see the side of him anymore because I am

3754.74 --> 3762.2599999999998
betrayed and that hurts a lot I can't

3757.68 --> 3766.319
stand the sight of him any longer really

3762.26 --> 3768.539
so I'm not doing it to silence him he

3766.319 --> 3771.63
can do whatever the hell he likes on his

3768.539 --> 3773.4900000000002
channel bless him but I will not

3771.63 --> 3775.829
tolerate his presence any longer after

3773.49 --> 3777.5989999999997
what he did well I didn't see it so I

3775.829 --> 3779.9700000000003
can't really say you know I mean I only

3777.599 --> 3782.13
saw it like I only listened to like five

3779.97 --> 3784.3489999999997
minutes or at most ten minutes of it and

3782.13 --> 3785.9700000000003
I heard him ask him all the questions

3784.349 --> 3788.2200000000003
and I wasn't sure whether he was

3785.97 --> 3789.5389999999998
trolling or whether he was just having a

3788.22 --> 3791.4289999999996
joke yeah

3789.539 --> 3794.8190000000004
see all it will assist it until the end

3791.429 --> 3797.819
so maybe you should watch it because he

3794.819 --> 3805.109
did the mind tricks and all of it and he

3797.819 --> 3807.359
just it's just look it's also the way he

3805.109 --> 3810.3289999999997
responds to that I was outraged and I

3807.359 --> 3812.489
told him look this is just sick what are

3810.329 --> 3815.099
you doing to yourself this is such an

3812.489 --> 3817.439
insult to your own intellect to me to

3815.099 --> 3820.289
our friendship all that and he just said

3817.439 --> 3824.4289999999996
oh don't worry about I love you bro and

3820.289 --> 3827.4590000000003
it's just like just to do that to try to

3824.429 --> 3829.2290000000003
temper after you just [ __ ] it all over

3827.459 --> 3831.029
the place like that makes me want to

3829.229 --> 3834.239
strangle you makes you even more

3831.029 --> 3837.889
disingenuous to do that to not even

3834.239 --> 3840.929
recognize the shame of what you've done

3837.889 --> 3844.759
to my face and just ah don't worry about

3840.929 --> 3844.759
it you know no that's disgusting

3845.419 --> 3850.429
sorry I can't handle that [ __ ] you know

3854.329 --> 3860.4100000000003
and Ali leb you know I'm not blocking

3858.259 --> 3863.689

3860.41 --> 3868.5789999999997
it's fine if you're pissed off you can

3863.689 --> 3872.1499999999996
talk about it but don't yeah don't go

3868.579 --> 3873.469
cursing on me you know Oh somebody's

3872.15 --> 3874.9390000000003
just setting the chat that he's done two

3873.469 --> 3876.679
videos this morning then does look like

3874.939 --> 3879.709
he's look loaded two videos this morning

3876.679 --> 3881.2090000000003
so I like to listen to these to see what

3879.709 --> 3884.89
he says cuz there might be a response in

3881.209 --> 3884.89
there somewhere probably Oh

3884.929 --> 3887.6890000000003
I'll be joining in a minute I'm just

3886.249 --> 3889.8799999999997
going to listen to it now all right

3887.689 --> 3896.479
thanks for coming back Randy really

3889.88 --> 3905.869
appreciate it glad yeah it makes me feel

3896.479 --> 3909.489
a little bit better at these can be

3905.869 --> 3909.489
dangerous oh by the way look at this

3918.45 --> 3921.2
it's not

3921.61 --> 3925.17
really heavy snow

3925.23 --> 3930.92
I don't know it's like snow or hail I

3927.06 --> 3930.92
don't know what it is what it is white

3931.08 --> 3935.27
[Music]

3932.27 --> 3935.27
yeah

3945.39 --> 3947.93
they

3948.0 --> 3952.22
so yeah we'll see where this goes

3959.88 --> 3972.7490000000003
right well I'm getting the retribution

3963.869 --> 3975.359
already so yeah just lost 16 subscribers

3972.749 --> 3979.5589999999997
it's really nice somebody retracted to

3975.359 --> 3981.9
their sock accounts apparently and I

3979.559 --> 3984.529
don't know must be some kind of social

3981.9 --> 3988.2000000000003
engineering attempt to punish me for

3984.529 --> 3989.249
getting mad with people because I can't

3988.2 --> 3991.049
do that of course I have to be

3989.249 --> 3993.779
goody-goody Arwen that tolerates

3991.049 --> 3998.069
everything that's the ultimate liberal

3993.779 --> 4001.069
new social justice warrior because I do

3998.069 --> 4004.759
have tendencies to be somewhat PC

4001.069 --> 4006.92
sometimes so the aim I must draw the

4004.759 --> 4010.13
conclusion that okay

4006.92 --> 4012.529
if you can do that then you must go this

4010.13 --> 4016.13
railroad in your personal development

4012.529 --> 4019.13
and outward expression otherwise yeah

4016.13 --> 4022.9990000000003
you're gonna be punished gonna be oh dad

4019.13 --> 4026.21
are we know you can be mad to anyone no

4022.999 --> 4027.14
you can't be mad to to flat-earthers for

4026.21 --> 4029.39
their misbehavior

4027.14 --> 4036.44
you're gonna lose some subscribers after

4029.39 --> 4039.14
that you're gonna feel it it's not okay

4036.44 --> 4044.14
monetization is coming it's not gonna be

4039.14 --> 4047.499
stopped now and whatever is gonna happen

4044.14 --> 4047.499
it's gonna happen

4050.45 --> 4055.8799999999997
yeah hey if you don't care anymore if

4053.46 --> 4059.43
you don't want to see my show

4055.88 --> 4064.4700000000003
well yeah guess unsubscribing would be

4059.43 --> 4066.45
the way to do it but I think you'll be

4064.47 --> 4068.3999999999996
sorry yet because yeah there is a lot of

4066.45 --> 4071.79
happening here and I do talk about a lot

4068.4 --> 4074.1800000000003
of things in heavy detail you know me

4071.79 --> 4078.06
you you've known me for years now so

4074.18 --> 4085.23
you'll be back and they even if nothing

4078.06 --> 4087.84
oh your loss it's my show hey you Randy

4085.23 --> 4089.07
welcome back all right yeah yeah he

4087.84 --> 4091.6800000000003
hasn't really said anything about it to

4089.07 --> 4094.8900000000003
be honest so it's hard to know what his

4091.68 --> 4099.7699999999995
position is right now yeah you're

4094.89 --> 4104.01
talking about Jose right yeah yeah well

4099.77 --> 4108.0
it'll be fair I think and I'm purely

4104.01 --> 4110.64
speculating now I almost shouldn't but I

4108.0 --> 4114.12
will do it anyway I think that Jose in

4110.64 --> 4116.52
his mind really just wants this to

4114.12 --> 4120.18
happen and for me to allow it and he

4116.52 --> 4123.72
probably does feel a little hurt that I

4120.18 --> 4126.3
am rejecting him over his actions so

4123.72 --> 4127.77
he's just like hoping it'll go away or

4126.3 --> 4130.08
something and everything will be all

4127.77 --> 4133.17
right in this is oh look Irene I'm back

4130.08 --> 4137.43
and let's be nice again through the

4133.17 --> 4140.01
footage and it just wants to forget it

4137.43 --> 4143.97
happen he just thinks it's okay to do

4140.01 --> 4145.860000000001
something like that and no change needs

4143.97 --> 4147.63
to happen in the world because no change

4145.86 --> 4152.339999999999
happens in his mind it's all the same to

4147.63 --> 4155.01
him it doesn't work that way for me so

4152.34 --> 4158.09
he's gonna have to deal with what he did

4155.01 --> 4158.09
one way or the other

4158.57 --> 4167.03
so yeah sorry Jose somebody said the

4164.4 --> 4171.629999999999
a.m. [ __ ] is that right I mean yeah

4167.03 --> 4174.48
well ambushed me look he's always tried

4171.63 --> 4177.96
to and I have to recognize I got the

4174.48 --> 4182.339999999999
signals okay and I chose to trust him I

4177.96 --> 4186.27
chose to be slightly naive forward goody

4182.34 --> 4189.900000000001
two-shoes and just say okay I trust you

4186.27 --> 4192.6
man it's okay you can be this sort of

4189.9 --> 4194.759999999999
in-between thing that's fine if you

4192.6 --> 4196.4400000000005
wanted to stay as neutral as you as you

4194.76 --> 4199.38
can that's that's okay that's fine with

4196.44 --> 4202.2
me be on the fence but that's not what

4199.38 --> 4205.52
he did that's not what he displayed he

4202.2 --> 4209.42
wasn't on the fence about things he was

4205.52 --> 4213.93
declaring straight-out bawler lies and

4209.42 --> 4217.14
machinations and showing mind deviations

4213.93 --> 4220.26
where he would literally not recognize

4217.14 --> 4222.990000000001
respond or even mentally absorb the

4220.26 --> 4225.45
things that were said the arguments not

4222.99 --> 4228.179999999999
respond that's baller that's not on the

4225.45 --> 4231.2699999999995
fence that's on that side that is in

4228.18 --> 4236.990000000001
that delusion and his misbehavior it is

4231.27 --> 4236.990000000001
lying and lying to everyone's face

4245.739 --> 4252.58
only to watch your back I think see what

4248.73 --> 4255.91
Joey so you see how he was because it

4252.58 --> 4260.17
it's difficult because and I find this

4255.91 --> 4263.32
again very annoying by me I respond I

4260.17 --> 4266.2
saw it happening pretty early on and I

4263.32 --> 4268.509999999999
started to get angry pretty early on and

4266.2 --> 4272.32
that's not I shoot again

4268.51 --> 4274.66
I'm not I'm a very real guy with real

4272.32 --> 4276.58
feelings that will express him and I'm

4274.66 --> 4278.65
not very tactical because what I should

4276.58 --> 4282.19
have done is see it coming and stay

4278.65 --> 4285.67
completely silence and just let him talk

4282.19 --> 4288.94
let him do his [ __ ] making him allowing

4285.67 --> 4291.67
him to calmly dig his hole without

4288.94 --> 4294.339999999999
interruption for himself to really show

4291.67 --> 4296.11
it but I instead basically said like

4294.34 --> 4299.650000000001
what are you doing stop it what are you

4296.11 --> 4301.87
doing this is wrong and that kind of

4299.65 --> 4305.08
takes the attention away from the acts

4301.87 --> 4308.25
of what he was doing himself but you can

4305.08 --> 4308.25
still see it through there

4312.96 --> 4318.2390000000005
I still have to watch the entire thing I

4315.239 --> 4320.849999999999
got like half way and then it's just no

4318.239 --> 4327.62
when I see myself responds like that I

4320.85 --> 4327.620000000001
feel it and it's just very uncomfortable

4328.61 --> 4335.57
but I have to rewatch the entire thing

4332.3 --> 4335.570000000001
as well

4340.5 --> 4348.6
so if you thought anymore about doing a

4342.67 --> 4354.0
twice a day show yeah of course I have

4348.6 --> 4354.0
but I also have some other plans and

4355.659 --> 4360.849999999999
especially now this second half of this

4358.51 --> 4367.77
month is going to be very complicated

4360.85 --> 4371.2300000000005
for me and financially as well as

4367.77 --> 4375.179
directions I can be taking both in the

4371.23 --> 4380.37
the Hangouts letters in this show and

4375.179 --> 4383.469
potential second show on top of that and

4380.37 --> 4387.13
well from the GTI angle because there I

4383.469 --> 4394.0
need to expand in that as well I need it

4387.13 --> 4396.25
for my own survival and so I just can't

4394.0 --> 4398.32
make any promises I can't just decide

4396.25 --> 4401.199
yeah I'm gonna do this now because it

4398.32 --> 4404.409
might break apart before it even got off

4401.199 --> 4407.11
the ground I need to stabilize things

4404.409 --> 4412.599999999999
first I need to stabilize my financial

4407.11 --> 4416.61
situation and yeah get this new railroad

4412.6 --> 4419.320000000001
going for this new period in my life and

4416.61 --> 4421.509999999999
once they are the first parts of those

4419.32 --> 4423.969
rails are built denna can actually see

4421.51 --> 4427.75
like yeah does it fit do I have the time

4423.969 --> 4430.929
to have the energy to do that because

4427.75 --> 4434.32
otherwise it would be just a sporadic

4430.929 --> 4437.77
extra thing and not a Daily Show next to

4434.32 --> 4438.34
this because a daily show like what I do

4437.77 --> 4440.620000000001
now

4438.34 --> 4444.46
one hour a little over one hour show a

4440.62 --> 4446.25
day it's very fixed and I can build up

4444.46 --> 4449.29
to that with my energy and my

4446.25 --> 4452.23
expectation and my focus and I can build

4449.29 --> 4457.179
down for that if you have two shows in a

4452.23 --> 4460.75
day then yeah it takes up so much time

4457.179 --> 4464.55
and energy and focus of the day that it

4460.75 --> 4468.219
may become disruptive take too much or

4464.55 --> 4470.889
my preparation energy will be less and

4468.219 --> 4473.83
there was simply it will degrade the

4470.889 --> 4475.9890000000005
overall output quality of what I do and

4473.83 --> 4479.469
I don't want that I want to keep it

4475.989 --> 4483.339999999999
where it is because there that level of

4479.469 --> 4484.03
energy is where I can tap into my inside

4483.34 --> 4488.89
the bed

4484.03 --> 4490.63
and actually apply it so yeah it sounds

4488.89 --> 4493.4800000000005
very complicated when they put it like

4490.63 --> 4497.8
this I I realized that but I have to

4493.48 --> 4499.709999999999
just hold it off for for a little while

4497.8 --> 4503.860000000001
until I'm sure that I can actually

4499.71 --> 4506.5
manage it to do that to do and I'll give

4503.86 --> 4512.74
a hint to the audience to do a flat

4506.5 --> 4516.04
earth night-owls show so and I really do

4512.74 --> 4520.45
want to do that I do want another set up

4516.04 --> 4522.5199999999995
with another audience with people that

4520.45 --> 4525.19
are much more into the day or into their

4522.52 --> 4527.35
evening and well maybe they could have a

4525.19 --> 4529.8099999999995
lot of debates and much more heated than

4527.35 --> 4532.870000000001
a breakfast show shedding it setting as

4529.81 --> 4535.330000000001
this is so it maybe with some shouting

4532.87 --> 4536.74
and even cursing and [ __ ] maybe

4535.33 --> 4538.54
something more in the direction of a

4536.74 --> 4541.75
flat earth debates that would be managed

4538.54 --> 4545.0199999999995
by me yeah that is a good idea I have

4541.75 --> 4548.26
been thinking about that for a while but

4545.02 --> 4550.4800000000005
I'm not ready to start that up yet but I

4548.26 --> 4554.05
will be if it's gonna happen it will

4550.48 --> 4557.16
absolutely happen probably within the

4554.05 --> 4557.16
next few months so

4560.58 --> 4571.34
I hope that informs you Randy yeah so

4566.01 --> 4573.780000000001
yeah please don't take my lack of

4571.34 --> 4579.03
immediately taking the idea and doing it

4573.78 --> 4584.09
right now as laziness or as like I'm not

4579.03 --> 4586.92
sure no I do want it but you know

4584.09 --> 4591.06
doesn't new things don't come so easy

4586.92 --> 4595.41
with me it's unfortunate side effect of

4591.06 --> 4600.240000000001
my being I have to get prepared and I

4595.41 --> 4605.7
will so on that note I think I'm gonna

4600.24 --> 4609.42
round it out okay unless you want

4605.7 --> 4616.349999999999
something to share or hang out you wanna

4609.42 --> 4621.18
blow no no okay all right well ante

4625.65 --> 4629.94
maybe I push you a little bit too hard

4627.66 --> 4632.13
with my energy I'm sorry for that be a

4629.94 --> 4633.99
little bit more careful next time you

4632.13 --> 4636.96
get on maybe we could talk about this

4633.99 --> 4641.219999999999
again you have been on my show before

4636.96 --> 4642.9
and that was better and we did get some

4641.22 --> 4645.51
misunderstandings out of the way on the

4642.9 --> 4650.61
spot I guess we didn't get to that point

4645.51 --> 4652.5
right here but yeah I'm not banning you
