1394.1 --> 1397.539
that it's gonna be a mess

1410.9 --> 1421.14
foreign

1412.49 --> 1421.14
[Music]

1426.86 --> 1433.52
weird though like why would the co-host

1430.159 --> 1436.4
be a scammer and not him

1433.52 --> 1438.62
how is this like is there something

1436.4 --> 1440.3600000000001
going on is this like an intricate

1438.62 --> 1442.6999999999998
history thing that

1440.36 --> 1444.5
sounds also I'm gonna build this school

1442.7 --> 1446.72
or something and then he had a co-host

1444.5 --> 1449.0
and then the co-host is kind of like a

1446.72 --> 1450.679
scammer and is that what it's about is

1449.0 --> 1453.2
this just about like oh

1450.679 --> 1455.7800000000002
this Santos guy in his school that he

1453.2 --> 1459.76
wanted to build and it's this mess is

1455.78 --> 1459.76
that what it is I I have no idea

1459.919 --> 1462.3400000000001
oh

1464.36 --> 1469.299
I'm wondering again like why did you

1466.82 --> 1469.299
bring it up

1478.299 --> 1484.22
parrot do you like Santos are you a fan

1481.82 --> 1487.039
of Santos

1484.22 --> 1490.84
because that would explain some things

1487.039 --> 1490.84
like why you'd give a [ __ ]

1491.9 --> 1511.0590000000002
[Music]

1505.12 --> 1511.059
Santos is good oh really is he now

1533.12 --> 1539.1999999999998
okay

1535.64 --> 1539.2
never heard of that guy

1562.46 --> 1566.539
right but just so you know tarot I don't

1565.1 --> 1571.1589999999999
know if you're aware of that you should

1566.539 --> 1573.32
be but Santos is kind of like a bad

1571.159 --> 1575.8400000000001
vegan one of those that gets all

1573.32 --> 1577.3999999999999
emotional and [ __ ]

1575.84 --> 1581.0
yeah

1577.4 --> 1582.98
the cultist variety I don't see anything

1581.0 --> 1587.26
that comes out of people like that as

1582.98 --> 1587.26
good because it usually isn't

1587.48 --> 1591.52
I think it's a form of derangement

1592.46 --> 1598.9
and it influences everything you do and

1596.12 --> 1598.8999999999999
how you do it

1602.659 --> 1607.7
so yeah no

1605.6 --> 1609.8799999999999
I don't know why you see him as good I

1607.7 --> 1609.88
don't

1614.659 --> 1618.1000000000001
[ __ ] does that mean

1620.6 --> 1625.4189999999999
what the hell is SS development

1631.64 --> 1636.7
the synchronous Society is that what

1634.039 --> 1636.7
that stands for

1637.82 --> 1641.6789999999999
he hijacked the development

1643.52 --> 1649.1
okay well

1645.2 --> 1651.2
look if it is Santos's project and his

1649.1 --> 1653.6589999999999
co-host just hijacked the development

1651.2 --> 1656.059
well guess that Santos doesn't really

1653.659 --> 1657.3200000000002
have control over the situation now does

1656.059 --> 1660.44
he

1657.32 --> 1666.9189999999999
so he's just messing up getting hijacked

1660.44 --> 1669.94
then my point reaffirm this guy is not

1666.919 --> 1669.94
it's not gonna work

1675.86 --> 1680.9189999999999
offline school and it's still online

1678.26 --> 1680.919
okay

1681.14 --> 1683.7990000000002
well

1684.44 --> 1690.039
online schools are a lot easier and

1687.62 --> 1690.039
cheaper

1690.5 --> 1694.34
especially to get new students so yeah

1692.539 --> 1696.74
an offline school is a whole different

1694.34 --> 1700.4599999999998
thing

1696.74 --> 1702.86
in a way you gotta already have really

1700.46 --> 1706.52
good reputation

1702.86 --> 1709.2199999999998
I guess to even get there and

1706.52 --> 1711.799
Fame

1709.22 --> 1713.24
and actually something that's really

1711.799 --> 1717.08
good

1713.24 --> 1720.679
like real on the edge content and not

1717.08 --> 1722.48
just more standardized [ __ ]

1720.679 --> 1726.7
that everybody already knows about and

1722.48 --> 1726.7
heard like a million times so

1726.86 --> 1735.1
yeah starting a completely new offline

1730.039 --> 1738.62
school that's really [ __ ] difficult

1735.1 --> 1740.299
really difficult to actually do that

1738.62 --> 1741.6789999999999
successfully unless it's just like a

1740.299 --> 1743.12
side project where you're like okay I'm

1741.679 --> 1745.279
just going to spend the rest of my life

1743.12 --> 1747.559
just being in this building hoping that

1745.279 --> 1751.159
people

1747.559 --> 1753.5
will come and be taught by me and a lot

1751.159 --> 1756.7990000000002
of the time they want right that's the

1753.5 --> 1760.399
option because if you want to be a

1756.799 --> 1763.34
successful offline school yeah yeah yeah

1760.399 --> 1764.779
you know what type of people tend to do

1763.34 --> 1767.779
that

1764.779 --> 1767.779
millionaires

1767.899 --> 1773.799
because it's really a big [ __ ] hassle

1771.02 --> 1773.799
to get that going

1774.08 --> 1779.72
because if you're not you're gonna have

1775.94 --> 1782.779
to have one hell of a shining radiant

1779.72 --> 1784.94
reputation and really good content

1782.779 --> 1788.12
otherwise just not gonna happen

1784.94 --> 1790.1000000000001
online schools are a lot easier

1788.12 --> 1793.2399999999998
because it's very easy to tune in it's

1790.1 --> 1793.24
very easy to tune out

1793.52 --> 1797.32
no travel involved so

1802.64 --> 1807.3990000000001
saying this with experience of last

1805.1 --> 1807.399
couple

1808.039 --> 1811.72
online school don't work

1816.38 --> 1821.3600000000001
that depends that depends on what you're

1818.899 --> 1824.899
gonna do with it I mean you have to like

1821.36 --> 1826.279
reformat what you're doing based on the

1824.899 --> 1828.3799999999999
fact that you're not going to be able to

1826.279 --> 1830.0
physically interact

1828.38 --> 1832.64
so

1830.0 --> 1836.62
all depends on what he does with it

1832.64 --> 1836.6200000000001
how much he realizes that

1840.65 --> 1845.259
[Music]

1845.899 --> 1852.62
I mean there is an advantage for uh an

1850.1 --> 1854.6
advantage of

1852.62 --> 1856.8799999999999
offline schooling

1854.6 --> 1858.32
if it that is standardized so that it's

1856.88 --> 1860.0
everywhere

1858.32 --> 1861.6789999999999
because you have to face to face

1860.0 --> 1864.62
interactions you can have physical

1861.679 --> 1867.0800000000002
interactions that includes like more

1864.62 --> 1869.299
detailed Spirit things

1867.08 --> 1871.279
that in spiritual matter you get more

1869.299 --> 1873.559
spiritual metadata that's pretty much it

1871.279 --> 1874.7
from offline School compared to online

1873.559 --> 1876.799
school

1874.7 --> 1879.46
so yeah you learn more

1876.799 --> 1879.46
but

1880.279 --> 1886.279
that doesn't mean that oh the offline

1883.34 --> 1888.98
school just doesn't work well that maybe

1886.279 --> 1891.559
if you're just

1888.98 --> 1893.1200000000001
if you're trying to do it like it is an

1891.559 --> 1895.76
offline School

1893.12 --> 1897.5
in an online school format yeah then

1895.76 --> 1899.72
it's not gonna work very well because

1897.5 --> 1901.88
it's not the same thing

1899.72 --> 1904.22
then have to have different approach

1901.88 --> 1907.7
because it's going to be much more about

1904.22 --> 1910.3990000000001
retaining the attention of the students

1907.7 --> 1912.44
because if they're literally physically

1910.399 --> 1915.08
sitting in a class and they're dozing

1912.44 --> 1918.5
off you can like Snap them out of it in

1915.08 --> 1921.1399999999999
the moment well if somebody's dozing off

1918.5 --> 1923.74
behind their screen you wouldn't even

1921.14 --> 1923.74
see it

1924.62 --> 1930.26
so you could much more easily lose your

1928.279 --> 1933.279
students attention online so you have to

1930.26 --> 1933.279
deal with all that

1933.32 --> 1942.1399999999999
anyway

1934.85 --> 1945.74
[Music]

1942.14 --> 1948.5800000000002
both online and offline modes well in

1945.74 --> 1948.58
offline mode

1949.22 --> 1955.76
but is that like a face-to-face in a

1952.58 --> 1957.22
building class situation offline mode or

1955.76 --> 1958.76
is that

1957.22 --> 1960.26
pre-recorded

1958.76 --> 1961.58
systems

1960.26 --> 1964.279
where

1961.58 --> 1966.02
the teachers basically just filming it

1964.279 --> 1968.179
recording it and then it's something

1966.02 --> 1971.539
that students can play and they can just

1968.179 --> 1974.0
basically follow the the tape

1971.539 --> 1977.12
and the instructions given by the tape

1974.0 --> 1980.12
this is more like the

1977.12 --> 1983.539
more like the coarse system right the

1980.12 --> 1985.6999999999998
online courses they typically follow

1983.539 --> 1988.58
that format sometimes it's just written

1985.7 --> 1990.799
everything's just written right it's a

1988.58 --> 1992.6589999999999
curriculum it can be pre-recorded it can

1990.799 --> 1994.8799999999999
be written down

1992.659 --> 1997.5800000000002
the subject

1994.88 --> 2000.1000000000001
follows the instructions and tries to

1997.58 --> 2002.86
execute the tasks

2000.1 --> 2006.48
and then send it in and gets tested

2002.86 --> 2006.4799999999998
that's a different format

2014.799 --> 2021.22
that's different from like lifetime

2471.83 --> 2478.29
[Music]

2487.06 --> 2492.04
okay there's yeah yeah Terry I know it's

2489.64 --> 2494.02
they put it into a unified time which is

2492.04 --> 2496.8
actually kind of smart

2494.02 --> 2496.8
but

2498.579 --> 2507.4
wait is there also just the the hour

2503.8 --> 2509.7400000000002
shift every half here does India do that

2507.4 --> 2512.04
too or do they just completely bypass

2509.74 --> 2512.04
that

2515.68 --> 2519.8199999999997
because in India well if it would be the

2518.02 --> 2521.32
case then you should be sure you should

2519.82 --> 2524.94
have already like shifted an hour

2521.32 --> 2524.94
forward oh yeah

2526.68 --> 2529.79
[Music]

2534.64 --> 2537.42
nice

2540.4 --> 2548.26
you can take the stress of text chat oh

2545.8 --> 2550.8390000000004
so it's emotional

2548.26 --> 2553.3
Jeff you got the

2550.839 --> 2555.04
the autumn

2553.3 --> 2558.94
getting to you

2555.04 --> 2562.359
I mean it's gotten to me too so

2558.94 --> 2565.7200000000003
I think that really started to stand out

2562.359 --> 2569.44
to me last Monday

2565.72 --> 2571.359
when I got when I rage quit the fed and

2569.44 --> 2572.7400000000002
listening back to that it turned out

2571.359 --> 2574.839
that whoa

2572.74 --> 2576.7599999999998
I wasn't doing too great even though I

2574.839 --> 2579.48
didn't even notice that

2576.76 --> 2579.48
at the time

2580.18 --> 2582.7799999999997
so

2583.54 --> 2589.48
yeah and Jeff gas look if you're like a

2586.54 --> 2592.7799999999997
little feeble or whatever due to Autumn

2589.48 --> 2595.42
that happens to the best of us and

2592.78 --> 2598.3
yeah it's a pretty sensible actually to

2595.42 --> 2601.0
kind of stay away from internet

2598.3 --> 2604.8390000000004
because a lot of the videos out there

2601.0 --> 2607.8
are just like ah you gotta oh look at

2604.839 --> 2607.7999999999997
this we're all doomed a little

2608.14 --> 2613.66
when I feel

2609.94 --> 2617.04
feel a little feeble or unstable I turn

2613.66 --> 2617.04
that [ __ ] the [ __ ] off

2617.53 --> 2621.82
[Music]

2629.8 --> 2635.8
you mean you got startled

2632.619 --> 2640.2000000000003
or they physically make you shake

2635.8 --> 2640.2000000000003
I hope not sounds pretty bad

2643.3 --> 2648.2090000000003
[Music]

2649.54 --> 2656.46
oh and Tony Whitcomb yeah that must have

2653.079 --> 2656.46
happened to a lot of people I think

2659.319 --> 2667.56
anyway yeah Jeff I really hope you uh

2663.579 --> 2667.5600000000004
you yeah you grow out of that

2686.8 --> 2691.1800000000003
I mean I could probably give you some

2689.319 --> 2694.3
tips if it's really like hard problem

2691.18 --> 2696.7599999999998
related but you probably already know

2694.3 --> 2699.3390000000004
all of that

2696.76 --> 2702.7000000000003
physically yes okay so you don't have

2699.339 --> 2704.859
any actual heart problems it's just that

2702.7 --> 2707.2599999999998
you got like the fluster this is weird

2704.859 --> 2709.119
by the way because I have that too and

2707.26 --> 2711.88
I've had that since

2709.119 --> 2714.2200000000003
very little kid

2711.88 --> 2716.02
I think it was inherited

2714.22 --> 2717.64
because my mother had it too but it was

2716.02 --> 2720.579
just never

2717.64 --> 2722.56
it was never like a real hard risk it's

2720.579 --> 2724.26
just that sometimes I just it just

2722.56 --> 2726.7599999999998
starts to get a little bit

2724.26 --> 2728.92
it makes me really nervous when it does

2726.76 --> 2730.599
that because it does feel like oh [ __ ]

2728.92 --> 2733.0
something's going wrong but it never

2730.599 --> 2736.54
really does

2733.0 --> 2739.44
and during Autumn that also typically

2736.54 --> 2739.44
starts happening

2740.26 --> 2744.1600000000003
maybe it'll go away again it's just like

2742.3 --> 2747.04
the stress it's just like if you're

2744.16 --> 2749.02
nervous high energy nervous that's when

2747.04 --> 2752.22
that starts to get triggered it's kind

2749.02 --> 2752.22
of distracting mostly

2752.8 --> 2757.7200000000003
so yeah just

2754.9 --> 2760.7200000000003
just don't watch any stupid

2757.72 --> 2763.24
like oh scary we're all doomed or oh

2760.72 --> 2765.52
we're all gonna die or the newest bill

2763.24 --> 2767.9399999999996
from some [ __ ] up politician right

2765.52 --> 2767.94
just

2768.04 --> 2773.8
put that aside

2770.859 --> 2775.7799999999997
just stick to cat videos or something

2773.8 --> 2780.1800000000003
right

2775.78 --> 2780.1800000000003
peaceful music in the forest

2781.48 --> 2785.94
you have heart problems okay

2793.0 --> 2797.099
what type what's the cause

2797.56 --> 2801.839
it's not vaccine related I hope

2801.9 --> 2807.96
fireplace 4K yeah that's a very good one

2804.819 --> 2810.46
especially for the winter

2807.96 --> 2813.4
and by the way

2810.46 --> 2815.079
actually having like a real fire in your

2813.4 --> 2817.78
garden

2815.079 --> 2820.6600000000003
on the starry night or something is also

2817.78 --> 2824.02
extremely therapeutical

2820.66 --> 2825.7
therapeutic so the real fight yeah now

2824.02 --> 2826.68
that you mention it I kind of like want

2825.7 --> 2828.52
that

2826.68 --> 2831.22
I love

2828.52 --> 2834.46
open fires

2831.22 --> 2837.9599999999996
as long as they're under control and I'm

2834.46 --> 2837.96
a very good fire controller

2847.96 --> 2851.619
anyway Jeff yeah if you don't want to

2850.54 --> 2854.319
talk about

2851.619 --> 2856.96
your personal issue too much then I get

2854.319 --> 2860.5
it we could talk about it

2856.96 --> 2863.7
whenever you want I'm not gonna like

2860.5 --> 2863.7
startle you or anything

2864.22 --> 2867.18
I'll make sure

2870.46 --> 2873.92
you just make sure you don't startle

2872.2 --> 2878.979
yourself

2873.92 --> 2878.9790000000003
[Music]

2882.76 --> 2887.88
this is what are you talking about

2884.68 --> 2887.8799999999997
refracted curvature

2888.05 --> 2891.369
[Music]

2892.42 --> 2897.52
yeah but just because Australia doesn't

2895.359 --> 2899.74
exist doesn't mean that you can't render

2897.52 --> 2903.4
a simulation

2899.74 --> 2905.0789999999997
of the celestials as if Australia did

2903.4 --> 2907.359
exist

2905.079 --> 2909.46
I mean

2907.359 --> 2911.92
have you seen just all the pristine

2909.46 --> 2913.48
surroundings where Mitchell is at I mean

2911.92 --> 2916.48
that just looks like a computer game

2913.48 --> 2918.46
it's all way too clean

2916.48 --> 2920.38
it's probably just a computer game that

2918.46 --> 2922.599
he just

2920.38 --> 2925.42
has a really beefed up computer to life

2922.599 --> 2928.6600000000003
render all that and even have models of

2925.42 --> 2931.359
himself and his family in there

2928.66 --> 2934.18
to make it extra convincing it's like

2931.359 --> 2938.0989999999997
very Advanced deep fake

2934.18 --> 2938.0989999999997
but yeah I mean it's possible

2940.18 --> 2944.56
no it's not

2942.04 --> 2946.3
Australia does actually exist but it's

2944.56 --> 2949.7999999999997
kind of funny to think about what's

2946.3 --> 2949.8
going on if it didn't exist

2953.2 --> 2960.0
like maybe Australia was like a giant

2956.14 --> 2960.0
virtual simulation all this time

2961.79 --> 2965.74
[Music]

2963.4 --> 2967.839
but then do the Australians themselves

2965.74 --> 2969.7599999999998
know that they are virtual simulations

2967.839 --> 2971.38
or do they actually think they're real

2969.76 --> 2974.28
people just like

2971.38 --> 2974.28
real people

2977.26 --> 2982.78
and also there's the issue like who are

2980.38 --> 2986.44
these actors

2982.78 --> 2988.5400000000004
that say they come from Australia and

2986.44 --> 2990.46
have Australian accents

2988.54 --> 2993.819
even though Australia doesn't exist are

2990.46 --> 2997.18
these like specific actors that are like

2993.819 --> 2998.98
programmed by the virtual world

2997.18 --> 3001.44
act out

2998.98 --> 3003.119
like they're real people or are they

3001.44 --> 3006.7200000000003
more like

3003.119 --> 3009.6600000000003
flesh drones that just get a material

3006.72 --> 3011.839
body to be able to experience the real

3009.66 --> 3011.839
world

3016.859 --> 3020.96
yeah I'm taking this to uh

3021.119 --> 3026.819
a variety of absurdities

3024.66 --> 3028.5
uh

3026.819 --> 3031.2
that's what you get when you say

3028.5 --> 3034.52
something like that

3031.2 --> 3034.52
I'll take it literal

3036.0 --> 3041.4
I love doing that

3039.06 --> 3043.44
because it's the only way to actually

3041.4 --> 3045.359
get something constructive out of

3043.44 --> 3046.7400000000002
something that's just really freaking

3045.359 --> 3048.5989999999997
stupid

3046.74 --> 3051.1189999999997
like oh yeah it's really freaking stupid

3048.599 --> 3054.059
it's lame that somebody brought that up

3051.119 --> 3056.819
so why not just imagine like it was

3054.059 --> 3059.579
actually real for a second what if

3056.819 --> 3063.0589999999997
and then you can get something out of it

3059.579 --> 3063.96
instead of just like not that again I

3063.059 --> 3066.7200000000003
hate it

3063.96 --> 3068.96
yeah that's what I do

3066.72 --> 3068.9599999999996
foreign

3076.28 --> 3082.38
Matrix within an actual simulation

3080.7 --> 3085.64
yeah the problem though is classical

3082.38 --> 3085.6400000000003
homeopath is that

3086.339 --> 3091.14
there's a real systematic problem with

3089.04 --> 3092.94
the globe you see

3091.14 --> 3095.04
problem is not

3092.94 --> 3097.859
that it isn't that

3095.04 --> 3099.0589999999997
the problem is is that it could never be

3097.859 --> 3101.7
that

3099.059 --> 3105.78
like you can't actually simulate the

3101.7 --> 3108.4199999999996
globe I mean you can render visuals that

3105.78 --> 3110.579
will give you the impression that it's

3108.42 --> 3113.099
real like in the movies

3110.579 --> 3115.92
but if you'd have an actual simulator

3113.099 --> 3117.98
like the Matrix let's just say heavy

3115.92 --> 3122.2200000000003
computer that could literally just

3117.98 --> 3124.319
create an entire virtual world

3122.22 --> 3127.5589999999997
and universe

3124.319 --> 3130.98
right well guess what

3127.559 --> 3133.8590000000004
you can't make it into a globe

3130.98 --> 3137.099
because the mechanics don't work at all

3133.859 --> 3139.859
yeah the visuals might work fine yeah

3137.099 --> 3142.319
you could make it seem like a glow but

3139.859 --> 3145.5
if you're actually gonna try to simulate

3142.319 --> 3149.22
it for realsies it's not gonna work

3145.5 --> 3151.76
because it doesn't fit it's all broken

3149.22 --> 3151.7599999999998
yeah

3152.099 --> 3157.02
the globe model and everything that is

3154.5 --> 3160.68
tied in with it is so broken that you

3157.02 --> 3164.04
cannot even simulate it as a reality

3160.68 --> 3164.94
uh-huh you can only simulate it in your

3164.04 --> 3167.339
mind

3164.94 --> 3169.68
where it's much easier to kind of like

3167.339 --> 3171.72
Overlook oh it doesn't really fit but

3169.68 --> 3173.339
I'm just smoothing it out oh Next Step

3171.72 --> 3175.14
oh that doesn't really ah we can

3173.339 --> 3176.7
smoothing it out and that's how you go

3175.14 --> 3178.98
about in the mind

3176.7 --> 3180.5989999999997
so in the minds the only place you can

3178.98 --> 3182.4
actually simulate the globe properly

3180.599 --> 3183.54
because as soon as you try to get it

3182.4 --> 3186.0
real

3183.54 --> 3188.94
some kind of solid system in a

3186.0 --> 3192.78
simulation and it doesn't work

3188.94 --> 3194.579
and it's always been the problem yeah

3192.78 --> 3199.079
because if that problem wouldn't have

3194.579 --> 3203.76
been there there would now be a second

3199.079 --> 3205.98
world simulation for like 20 years that

3203.76 --> 3208.26
would be there now there would be a

3205.98 --> 3210.839
place where it's like yeah this is our

3208.26 --> 3213.119
computer it's running the second Earth

3210.839 --> 3214.619
simulation like where it is a ball and

3213.119 --> 3216.48
it is in outer space and everything

3214.619 --> 3219.42
works

3216.48 --> 3222.98
but they can't because you can't

3219.42 --> 3226.2000000000003
actually simulate the heliocentric world

3222.98 --> 3227.26
because none of the mechanics actually

3226.2 --> 3229.7599999999998
add up

3227.26 --> 3233.2400000000002
[Music]

3229.76 --> 3236.6400000000003
it might add up mathematically for a bit

3233.24 --> 3240.0789999999997
but physically it does not and so you

3236.64 --> 3240.0789999999997
cannot actually simulate it

3240.13 --> 3252.9
[Music]

3249.42 --> 3256.98
but you know I'm right right because

3252.9 --> 3258.9
yeah there would be a second Globe Earth

3256.98 --> 3262.319
simulator there would be a simulator

3258.9 --> 3265.02
where it's like look this is the globe

3262.319 --> 3267.42
this is the physics like you can zoom in

3265.02 --> 3269.64
and it's just like Earth and

3267.42 --> 3272.7000000000003
and like yeah with the gravity and all

3269.64 --> 3276.18
that and gas not escaping into the

3272.7 --> 3279.18
vacuum etc etc etc etc all of that it

3276.18 --> 3280.319
would all have to be made to work in a

3279.18 --> 3284.3999999999996
simulation

3280.319 --> 3288.0
but they can't because it doesn't work

3284.4 --> 3290.339
yeah you can make it officially work you

3288.0 --> 3293.22
can even make it mathematically work

3290.339 --> 3297.359
most of the time

3293.22 --> 3300.74
you can't make it mechanically work

3297.359 --> 3300.74
that's their main problem

3300.96 --> 3306.98
Earth 2.0 yeah I know that game it was

3304.38 --> 3306.98
really lame

3308.28 --> 3313.6800000000003
didn't do [ __ ]

3310.26 --> 3315.599
so Evolution garbage and terrible

3313.68 --> 3317.7599999999998
graphics

3315.599 --> 3320.339
or at least maybe yeah that's an older

3317.76 --> 3323.76
games from the 90s or something

3320.339 --> 3327.2599999999998
I had it on my Amiga

3323.76 --> 3327.26
it was really lame

3329.819 --> 3333.74
but that's not even what I'm talking

3331.5 --> 3336.48
like those are like pretty primitive

3333.74 --> 3339.1189999999997
simulator mostly like oh how did life

3336.48 --> 3342.119
evolve

3339.119 --> 3343.92
but that's just stupid

3342.119 --> 3346.4

3343.92 --> 3346.4
physics

3357.42 --> 3363.92
foreign

3359.54 --> 3363.92
oh it's a new one all right

3365.819 --> 3369.3
it's in reality it's the scam what

3367.68 --> 3370.98
wouldn't be surprising it's like oh

3369.3 --> 3371.88
we're building it oh we're almost there

3370.98 --> 3373.7400000000002
oh

3371.88 --> 3375.78
oh and he's gone and the money's gone

3373.74 --> 3377.64
and it's not complete because it could

3375.78 --> 3379.38
never be completed and the guy must have

3377.64 --> 3381.1189999999997
known when he started it that it could

3379.38 --> 3383.6600000000003
never be completed so yeah it's probably

3381.119 --> 3383.6600000000003
a scam

3402.96 --> 3406.64
the supposed Earth you're standing on

3406.74 --> 3412.2
it always gets postponed needs more

3409.38 --> 3415.94

just a prop it doesn't even have real

still sitting there on the ground

It's Never Gonna Leave the ground

3831.599 --> 3835.619

in the plane and the pilot knew about

4021.98 --> 4027.38

you were talking about other than it

4029.359 --> 4034.5789999999997

4102.739 --> 4109.16
heard of that yeah

4141.859 --> 4148.779
it gets red

that's it

ah

4181.219 --> 4185.42
but yeah lumpy gas in a vacuum it would

4183.319 --> 4187.219
be pretty cool to have like a video of

4185.42 --> 4190.9400000000005
that

4187.219 --> 4193.58
like a hand like a typical mobile phone

4190.94 --> 4195.86
video where you just like in the play

4195.86 --> 4200.299999999999
on there

4198.26 --> 4202.219
and then you turn around literally as

4200.3 --> 4203.84
you start to see sunlight coming from

4202.219 --> 4207.26
your back or something and it's like oh

4203.84 --> 4208.84
what it just came up over there would

4224.659 --> 4227.379999999999
freaking red

4228.02 --> 4233.84

three days

4233.84 --> 4240.02
why doesn't it Go below the Horizon like

the sun why does it just phase out

I don't know why it goes red it's weird

4252.92 --> 4258.4400000000005
doesn't go under like the sun it just

4255.8 --> 4260.6
phases out or phases in that's a lot

4258.44 --> 4262.339999999999
weirder to me

4260.6 --> 4265.34
after that point I don't really care

4512.06 --> 4516.4400000000005
just know

4513.62 --> 4518.3
the missing evidence and the distinctly

4516.44 --> 4523.28
present evidence

4518.3 --> 4525.62
in order to derive a pattern what it is

4523.28 --> 4528.86
that doesn't automatically mean that I

4525.62 --> 4530.48
know how the [ __ ] that is even possible

4528.86 --> 4532.759999999999
okay

4530.48 --> 4535.04
it just is

4532.76 --> 4537.6990000000005
doesn't mean that I couldn't find out

4535.04 --> 4537.699
over time

4537.739 --> 4543.5599999999995
but it doesn't mean that that doesn't

4540.739 --> 4546.0199999999995
mean that I know it right now or that I

4543.56 --> 4548.54
will guarantee be guaranteed to find out

4546.02 --> 4551.4800000000005
over time I don't know

4548.54 --> 4554.179
very curious about it but I don't know

4551.48 --> 4556.94
and it would be silly to just start

4554.179 --> 4559.76
assuming things about it when I do not

4556.94 --> 4560.58
fully comprehend the nature of the

4559.76 --> 4563.360000000001
predicament

4560.58 --> 4567.44
[Music]

4563.36 --> 4570.38
hologram is a bold statement no it's not

4567.44 --> 4573.08
it's an image of light

4570.38 --> 4575.38
it's non-physical non-euclidean there's

4573.08 --> 4578.96
no other alternative

4575.38 --> 4581.3
mechanically to attribute

4578.96 --> 4582.77
Jenny

4581.3 --> 4584.4800000000005
yeah

4582.77 --> 4585.92
[Music]

4584.48 --> 4590.0
what what

4585.92 --> 4593.2390000000005
description or title or whatever what

4590.0 --> 4596.179
would you ascribe to something that does

4593.239 --> 4600.199
not have a physical location

4596.179 --> 4603.9800000000005
and can only be seen

4600.199 --> 4606.0199999999995
and interacted with light

4603.98 --> 4608.199
what do you call what would you call

4606.02 --> 4608.1990000000005
that

4610.94 --> 4618.5599999999995
a non-object not a position only light

4615.159 --> 4621.86
moves with you as you move Etc yeah what

4618.56 --> 4624.4400000000005
what would you call that then huh you

4621.86 --> 4627.759999999999
know a better alternative than hologram

4624.44 --> 4627.759999999999
like to hear about it

4630.02 --> 4634.64
any citation what the [ __ ] is the

4632.78 --> 4637.5199999999995
citation to do with that there is no

4634.64 --> 4639.1990000000005
evidence for it being physical it has no

4637.52 --> 4642.8
location

4639.199 --> 4646.54
you can't get there it moves with you it

4642.8 --> 4646.54
never changes angular size

4648.32 --> 4655.36
it doesn't grow more intense in energy

4651.38 --> 4659.679
and angular size bigger when you

4655.36 --> 4659.679
appear to approach it

4662.3 --> 4669.56
I mean do you know any physical objects

4665.12 --> 4671.48
that do that do you Jenny

4669.56 --> 4674.719
do you know

4671.48 --> 4678.199
how many objects physical objects do you

4674.719 --> 4679.4
know that move with you every time you

4678.199 --> 4683.139999999999
move

4679.4 --> 4683.139999999999
that never change size

4685.04 --> 4689.06
yeah

4686.42 --> 4691.54
angular wise how many things do you know

4689.06 --> 4691.54
out there

4692.659 --> 4700.299999999999
that are physical that that do that nah

4697.34 --> 4700.3
not any

4704.199 --> 4707.799999999999
yeah yeah it does

4710.36 --> 4716.36
it isn't there when you go straight

4713.179 --> 4719.3
towards it it doesn't grow bigger

4716.36 --> 4722.599999999999
it actually weirdly enough grows smaller

4719.3 --> 4724.400000000001
also Stars disappear

4722.6 --> 4726.9800000000005
yeah

4724.4 --> 4729.639999999999
and it's always Out Of Reach

4726.98 --> 4729.639999999999
always

4732.26 --> 4738.62
you can't get there you can never get

4735.199 --> 4742.5199999999995
there but you can't even go towards it

4738.62 --> 4745.659
because there is no apparent proximity

4742.52 --> 4745.659000000001
increase at all

4748.64 --> 4754.52
ever

4749.9 --> 4758.96
yeah there is no footage in existence

4754.52 --> 4761.6
of an attempt of approach over time to

4758.96 --> 4766.76
the sun in any form in which angular

4761.6 --> 4770.84
size can be seen to increase an energy

4766.76 --> 4773.96
output increase due to proximity yeah

4770.84 --> 4776.42
yeah that doesn't exist it never has

4773.96 --> 4779.36
existed it will never exist because the

4776.42 --> 4781.219
sum is a non-local hologram that is not

4779.36 --> 4783.099999999999
an object in a position that you can

4781.219 --> 4784.76
approach

4783.1 --> 4785.35
[Music]

4784.76 --> 4788.529
it

4785.35 --> 4788.529
[Music]

4788.96 --> 4795.38
oh yeah and that distance to the moon

4791.38 --> 4798.86
it's the same thing moon is also a

4795.38 --> 4801.02
hologram yeah and so are the planets

4798.86 --> 4805.099999999999
sorry the Stars

4801.02 --> 4808.6990000000005
and so our falling stars

4805.1 --> 4810.620000000001
and a lot of other Celestial phenomena

4808.699 --> 4814.639999999999
like comets

4810.62 --> 4819.08
that might be seen anything and probably

4814.64 --> 4820.58
the weird ISS like looking Crystal

4819.08 --> 4823.78
type thing

4820.58 --> 4826.34
might even also be a non-local hologram

4823.78 --> 4828.32
inherent Celestial phenomenon that is

4826.34 --> 4830.900000000001
part of the entire mechanism and it has

4828.32 --> 4835.28
been hijacked

4830.9 --> 4838.099999999999
by the Helia Centrist programmers

4835.28 --> 4840.5
to suggest that it is a space station

4838.1 --> 4844.219
that they build up there even though

4840.5 --> 4845.96
that thing that sighting has existed for

4844.219 --> 4848.6
hundreds of years

4845.96 --> 4851.0
yeah

4848.6 --> 4854.780000000001
yeah did you know that

4851.0 --> 4856.34
that that little ISS shape thingy

4854.78 --> 4858.739
that is sometimes seen through

4856.34 --> 4860.92
telescopes that bet that has been

4858.739 --> 4864.678999999999
spotted

4860.92 --> 4867.26
200 years ago yeah yeah

4864.679 --> 4870.14
what are you gonna do about it huh

4867.26 --> 4873.26
200 years ago oh oh yeah yeah they did

4870.14 --> 4877.400000000001
not build the ISS back then did they but

4873.26 --> 4879.56
it was still cited and written about

4877.4 --> 4881.12
yeah what the [ __ ] are you gonna do

4879.56 --> 4882.280000000001
about it huh

4881.12 --> 4885.3589999999995
nothing

4891.08 --> 4898.369
[Music]

4924.5 --> 4927.1
foreign

4957.26 --> 4960.8
got any proof to back that last

4959.179 --> 4965.5
statement

4960.8 --> 4965.5
no only word of mouth

4969.62 --> 4974.0599999999995
I mean I think that any writings

4971.96 --> 4977.12
concerning it have been meticulously

4974.06 --> 4980.4800000000005
haunted down and destroyed

4977.12 --> 4981.92
probably by Jesuits

4980.48 --> 4984.339999999999
it's probably something they actually

4981.92 --> 4984.34
did

4986.239 --> 4992.12
yeah word of mouth and yeah that's it I

4989.6 --> 4995.4800000000005
know it's true though

4992.12 --> 4998.719
I don't give a fleeting [ __ ] that that

4995.48 --> 5002.86
doesn't satisfy you and your disgusting

4998.719 --> 5003.96
need for lie confirmation

5002.86 --> 5006.699
yeah

5003.96 --> 5009.3
so oh you don't get proof yeah because

5006.699 --> 5012.5199999999995
it was destroyed

5009.3 --> 5014.92
meticulously in anticipation of doing

5012.52 --> 5017.02
that thing

5014.92 --> 5019.719
and there's nothing I can do about it

5017.02 --> 5023.02
but I don't give a [ __ ]

5019.719 --> 5025.42
if you don't believe it you can shove it

5023.02 --> 5027.96

thank you

5100.78 --> 5105.58
all right good by the way it would be

5102.88 --> 5110.1
pretty awesome if I actually found some

5105.58 --> 5110.1
scanned in written alt text

5110.38 --> 5115.96
from like uh Native religions I'm really

5113.98 --> 5119.739
hoping that there's something left like

5115.96 --> 5122.62
in Russia they're all they're very old

5119.739 --> 5126.0599999999995
tribal religions

5122.62 --> 5126.0599999999995
because it's mostly there

5126.1 --> 5129.160000000001
yeah that's where it's apparently seen a

5128.86 --> 5131.38
lot

5129.16 --> 5134.159
[Music]

5131.38 --> 5134.159000000001

5135.04 --> 5142.9
yeah there should be somewhere some text

5139.92 --> 5145.84
that actually describes the sighting of

5142.9 --> 5148.36
this little crystal in the sky

5145.84 --> 5150.400000000001
that should be very old it should be

5148.36 --> 5155.259999999999
there somewhere it has to be there

5150.4 --> 5157.099999999999
because it was just seen by everyone

5155.26 --> 5161.859
it's not new

5163.719 --> 5168.94

5167.199 --> 5171.28
text

5168.94 --> 5173.678999999999
and I kind of hope that when they

5171.28 --> 5176.139
destroyed all that

5173.679 --> 5178.2390000000005
and probably killed a lot of people on

5176.139 --> 5181.679
top of that for it

5178.239 --> 5181.678999999999

5318.82 --> 5324.5199999999995
oh look they got all the original things

genocided the [ __ ] out of the place

5327.58 --> 5333.219
yeah

5329.08 --> 5335.26
it's not worth it destroy it all

remnant of this organization left

5452.5 --> 5455.34
I managed to basically

5456.82 --> 5460.259999999999

5476.62 --> 5483.46
all right but yeah you know we're gonna

reset there's no way to avoid it then

5483.46 --> 5491.5
why not reset hard

5486.1 --> 5494.26
like really hard and totally utterly

5491.5 --> 5495.76
route out these [ __ ] cursed

5494.26 --> 5498.219

that have ruined

5498.219 --> 5508.12

5504.52 --> 5508.96
that's completely and utterly destroy

how about that

5525.82 --> 5530.08
no we can't be tempted to go after the

we can't physically strike them down

5533.34 --> 5537.82
yeah nice

5535.54 --> 5540.04
to a certain degree it's true I mean if

5537.82 --> 5542.5
you strike one down

5540.04 --> 5544.06
it's just a marker effect the entire

5542.5 --> 5546.159
organization is just gonna come after

5544.06 --> 5549.219

5552.159 --> 5560.379999999999

5658.96 --> 5663.28
otherwise I'm gonna round out the show

5660.82 --> 5667.38
right now

5663.28 --> 5667.38
got 30 seconds to say something

5687.58 --> 5691.54
you don't seem to want to discuss where

5690.1 --> 5694.96
where the hell are you taking that from

5691.54 --> 5697.78
I am discussing it or you know I'm

5694.96 --> 5700.719
discussing it continually

5697.78 --> 5704.139
and then nobody says any [ __ ] thing

5700.719 --> 5706.78
back about it what do you expect from me

5704.139 --> 5709.5
you know a discussion requires more than

5706.78 --> 5709.5
one person

5714.42 --> 5719.32
each subject got me pretty angry well

5716.92 --> 5721.84
have you ever considered that maybe I'm

5719.32 --> 5726.0
just angry and it doesn't have anything

5721.84 --> 5726.0
to do with the subjects necessarily

5736.42 --> 5740.58
people don't want to get banned

5740.62 --> 5743.34
well

5743.98 --> 5747.4
that's [ __ ]

5745.78 --> 5751.5
if you don't want to get banned then

5747.4 --> 5751.5
don't act like an idiot

5751.6 --> 5757.780000000001
don't double down with gamma behavior

5754.179 --> 5760.78
and don't try to play me

5757.78 --> 5764.0199999999995
yeah it's very easy

5760.78 --> 5767.759999999999
just because I'm annoyed or agitated

5764.02 --> 5767.76
doesn't mean that I'm gonna ban you

5770.139 --> 5776.400000000001
unless you are obviously a troll with a

5772.96 --> 5776.4
very stupid troll name

5777.58 --> 5785.62
or if you're one of these wankers

5781.32 --> 5787.54
citation citation proof yeah that's

5785.62 --> 5790.12
[ __ ] annoying

5787.54 --> 5793.9
I'm not even talking scientific

5790.12 --> 5797.08
yeah when you say that [ __ ] that applies

5793.9 --> 5802.299999999999
to science I'm not talking about science

5797.08 --> 5802.3
I'm talking about observations history

5802.96 --> 5812.28
yeah things that I've heard seen

5807.88 --> 5812.28
and logical conclusions that I've drawn

5813.219 --> 5821.639
yeah has nothing to do with [ __ ]

5816.54 --> 5821.639
citations or anything like that

5829.34 --> 5834.58
[Music]

5831.58 --> 5836.08
I know I won't but yeah well I want

5834.58 --> 5837.88
Butch because you don't have an argument

5836.08 --> 5839.739
or a knuckle Womble you don't have an

5837.88 --> 5841.84
argument at all

5839.739 --> 5847.739
that's why I spent almost the entire

5841.84 --> 5847.7390000000005
show addressing that the moon the Sun

5848.139 --> 5853.179
yeah it's like and the guy popping up

5850.78 --> 5855.699
where does it go red yeah yeah why does

5853.179 --> 5859.5
it just completely phase out of exist

5855.699 --> 5863.32
and when it touched the Horizon yeah

5859.5 --> 5867.04
explain that to me with your rock going

5863.32 --> 5869.5599999999995
behind the curve yeah

5867.04 --> 5872.38
yeah you want because you can't nobody

5869.56 --> 5875.7390000000005
can it's an absolute suspense of

5872.38 --> 5879.54
disbelief breaker for your Globe model

5875.739 --> 5881.929999999999
there is no logical feasible explanation

5879.54 --> 5889.539
to even touch it

5881.93 --> 5889.539000000001
[Music]

5891.4 --> 5896.379999999999
why do you think Artemis will never

5893.5 --> 5897.1
launch too big is that argument yeah it

5896.38 --> 5900.04
is

5897.1 --> 5902.219
it won't launch because they want to do

5900.04 --> 5902.219
that

5904.84 --> 5910.96
yeah

5906.58 --> 5913.659
when you postpone cancel launches

5910.96 --> 5917.02
usually people are gonna be eventually

5913.659 --> 5918.4
like yeah [ __ ] this I'm not gonna do

5917.02 --> 5921.34
anything with this anymore I'm not gonna

5918.4 --> 5924.159
fund this I'm gonna I'm out of here well

5921.34 --> 5925.360000000001
with this one it's so big and it's so

5924.159 --> 5928.36
promising

5925.36 --> 5930.88
that it can work and people just refuse

5928.36 --> 5934.0599999999995
to let go so they're gonna keep doing

5930.88 --> 5939.9400000000005
this and doing this and doing this

5934.06 --> 5941.7390000000005
okay for potentially years to come years

5939.94 --> 5942.879999999999
and it's never going to come off the

5941.739 --> 5945.759999999999
ground

5942.88 --> 5948.28
because they don't have to because

5945.76 --> 5951.1
people refuse to give up on it and

5948.28 --> 5953.139
people are paying millions and millions

5951.1 --> 5954.9400000000005
and millions every day

5953.139 --> 5957.219
collectively

5954.94 --> 5959.62
in the hopes that it will do something

5957.219 --> 5960.94
which it never will and they'll keep

5959.62 --> 5963.34
this going

5960.94 --> 5965.919999999999
and it will be the most profitable

5963.34 --> 5968.9800000000005
non-launch

5965.92 --> 5972.6990000000005
the world is ever known yeah because

5968.98 --> 5974.98
that's what they want they want you to

5972.699 --> 5977.86
just give it to them they want you to

5974.98 --> 5980.678999999999
give everything to them with nothing in

5977.86 --> 5982.839999999999
return that's exactly what they want and

5980.679 --> 5986.679
they got it now they're working on it

5982.84 --> 5990.52
and they're gonna keep on doing that

5986.679 --> 5993.52
until like the last person drops off and

5990.52 --> 5996.1
it's like okay I'm done with this

5993.52 --> 5998.5
and it might be years

5996.1 --> 6000.780000000001
yeah that's exactly what they're doing

5998.5 --> 6003.6
right now

6000.78 --> 6005.759999999999
and I'm just calling it ahead of time

6003.6 --> 6007.9400000000005
that that is what they're doing right

6005.76 --> 6007.9400000000005
now

6009.48 --> 6015.659
has nothing to do with oh I don't think

6012.179 --> 6020.52
the design this or even that that's all

6015.659 --> 6024.239
side issues they made it extra big

6020.52 --> 6026.46
to give that oh giant penis effect so

6024.239 --> 6030.0
that people are more invested they

6026.46 --> 6033.5
wanted more and they'll hold on to the

6030.0 --> 6033.5
giant dick longer

6033.659 --> 6039.259999999999
yeah that's why has nothing to do with

6036.78 --> 6039.259999999999
design

6039.719 --> 6045.6
I don't even like the entire idea of

6042.719 --> 6048.08
giant Rockets is preposterous in the

6045.6 --> 6048.08
first instance

6048.36 --> 6051.62
it's very impractical

6057.02 --> 6065.2390000000005
[Music]

6063.239 --> 6065.239
um

6071.34 --> 6074.3
foreign

6087.44 --> 6093.54
's girlfriend is all dressed up yeah

6090.42 --> 6095.28
nowhere to go because Apollo's turned

6093.54 --> 6099.32
out to be gay

6095.28 --> 6099.32
wasn't interested in his girlfriend

6100.44 --> 6105.78
he's now just stuck to a rock somewhere

6103.5 --> 6108.02
getting picked at his delivered by some

6105.78 --> 6108.0199999999995
Eagles

6108.78 --> 6112.38
because he was gay

6110.699 --> 6116.0
nah not really because he didn't fight

6112.38 --> 6116.0
whatever you know what I mean

6116.61 --> 6120.67
[Music]

great

6167.699 --> 6172.339999999999
my last word no my last word on it

6173.84 --> 6181.26
origin prediction yeah

6177.659 --> 6185.719
like right here prediction

6181.26 --> 6189.54
not a technical reason it's making a

6185.719 --> 6193.679
prediction it's never gonna come off the

6189.54 --> 6197.119
ground is my prediction yeah

6193.679 --> 6200.28
it has nothing to do with inquiry

6197.119 --> 6203.099999999999
explanation or anything it's my

6200.28 --> 6209.159
prediction it will not come off the

6203.1 --> 6209.159000000001
ground is my prediction yeah

6209.58 --> 6214.619
that's all

6212.219 --> 6216.78
now you can go wait

6214.619 --> 6218.639
because you believe it'll come off the

6216.78 --> 6221.82
ground

6218.639 --> 6224.6990000000005
or you could listen

6221.82 --> 6227.48
and realize that that thing is not what

6224.699 --> 6227.48
you think it is

6241.08 --> 6246.659
in the middle of rounding out right but

6245.219 --> 6248.82
anyway

6246.659 --> 6252.599999999999
I'll be back tomorrow with flat Earth
