28.96 --> 35.759
look for

30.98 --> 35.759
[Music]

67.88 --> 72.92
good morning welcome to Flat Earth early

71.36 --> 76.159
bird number

72.92 --> 78.0
1994 I'm your host Arwin and before

76.159 --> 80.96000000000001
start the show please don't forget to

78.0 --> 83.52
share it on any platform you deem fit

80.96 --> 86.28
and if you haven't already subscribed to

83.52 --> 88.479
my channel hit the Bell notification so

86.28 --> 90.799
you know when I'm going live which is

88.479 --> 93.479
normally 2:00 p.m. I'm I'm time every

90.799 --> 95.64
day and please also do support me

93.479 --> 97.2
through the PayPal and the patreon that

95.64 --> 98.36
would be much appreciated and I can

97.2 --> 101.159
always use the

98.36 --> 104.84
support any support would be

101.159 --> 104.84
great right weather

105.0 --> 108.799
today very similar to

114.04 --> 118.84
yesterday bit clouded here and there but

116.92 --> 121.84
still sun coming through there's a lot

118.84 --> 124.799
more wind

121.84 --> 124.799
it's really standing

137.879 --> 142.599
out there you go it's a proper

145.319 --> 151.23899999999998
view yeah interesting Cloudscape out

148.239 --> 151.239
there

157.12 --> 163.31900000000002
right so it is Monday the 1st of July

169.879 --> 174.879
2024 temperature is 19°

177.92 --> 183.07999999999998
C 55%

180.76 --> 184.48
humidity really seems to keep hanging

183.08 --> 187.68
around that

184.48 --> 187.67999999999998
50% a

187.799 --> 190.799
lot

199.28 --> 204.959
right right according to this it is

202.0 --> 207.08
going to like kind of cool down coming

204.959 --> 210.599
few days with more

207.08 --> 215.4
rain so I'll take this

210.599 --> 215.39999999999998
I'll take this enjoy it as much as I

230.439 --> 236.319
can right so hope everybody's doing all

233.319 --> 236.319
right

240.04 --> 246.67999999999998
my show yesterday I thought was very

244.36 --> 249.12
interesting yeah did get some really

246.68 --> 249.12
weird

249.84 --> 253.159
responses to

255.359 --> 260.44
it but yeah there may have been just

257.84 --> 262.84
something in the air for a while people

260.44 --> 262.84
acting

264.52 --> 270.79999999999995
strange om Benjamin was also complaining

267.32 --> 273.32
about that last Friday so I don't know

270.8 --> 275.72
what's going around but it seems

273.32 --> 279.639
like some people

275.72 --> 281.84000000000003
suddenly lowered the bar for themselves

279.639 --> 281.84000000000003
a

282.32 --> 287.479
lot and uh yeah it's very

289.28 --> 295.4
disappointing right but yeah yesterday's

292.32 --> 298.88
subject complicated

295.4 --> 303.71999999999997
tough right about nature of light but

298.88 --> 308.4
also drawing into doubt nature of

303.72 --> 308.40000000000003
radio because yeah because of the

308.639 --> 314.6
connection connection that they

311.08 --> 316.479
have you could argue that radio is like

314.6 --> 319.319
in the spectrum of light and light is in

316.479 --> 323.44
the spectrum of radio so that it may be

319.319 --> 327.6
a form of invisible light in a way right

323.44 --> 329.919
but with radio it's even more emphasized

327.6 --> 332.199
in the technical

329.919 --> 335.039
engineering based descriptions and

332.199 --> 338.52000000000004
everything on it being a wave but I've

335.039 --> 338.52
just been thinking a lot about

341.4 --> 347.75899999999996
it about what exactly makes it a

349.319 --> 355.28000000000003
wave and that there might be two

352.16 --> 355.28000000000003
different kinds

355.56 --> 360.4
of waves basically

361.56 --> 365.4
that may be involved

366.0 --> 372.12
like there all this frequency

369.12 --> 374.96
stuff and change the frequency change

372.12 --> 377.84000000000003
the color or whatever

374.96 --> 380.96
right or you can do that with radio too

377.84 --> 380.96
doesn't change the color

382.36 --> 392.08000000000004
but that it is where like the entire

386.88 --> 395.8
Assumption of a wave rests upon that

392.08 --> 398.56
attribute but it basically has nothing

395.8 --> 401.84000000000003
to do with any kind of

398.56 --> 404.599
motion of the thing in which it

401.84 --> 406.88
manifests it's almost like the wave is

404.599 --> 406.88
is

407.0 --> 411.08
secondary

408.599 --> 414.68
that a

411.08 --> 418.599
wave happens to

414.68 --> 421.199
it but that it itself is in the wave

418.599 --> 423.87899999999996
it's yeah it's just turning out to be a

421.199 --> 426.879
little bit more

423.879 --> 429.47900000000004
complex and I'm trying to puzzle it

426.879 --> 434.56
together like to really try to figure

429.479 --> 434.56
out like what's actually happening

435.039 --> 440.84
why why is there such a

438.639 --> 443.68
hassle mostly with

440.84 --> 445.63899999999995
light and the consideration of it being

443.68 --> 449.84000000000003
a wave

445.639 --> 451.479
and and with it the extension into radi

449.84 --> 454.52
as

451.479 --> 458.0
well and so yeah I'm just digging

454.52 --> 461.19899999999996
through it and trying to figure it

458.0 --> 464.36
out and a really clear idea about it

461.199 --> 468.28000000000003
yesterday night but I have to like get

464.36 --> 470.44
into it again and wake up a bit more so

468.28 --> 473.44
maybe after I had my

470.44 --> 476.039
coffee I'll be able

473.44 --> 478.0
to get my thoughts back together about

476.039 --> 482.24
it

478.0 --> 485.72
again but I was thinking that maybe the

482.24 --> 489.319
the wave attributes are wave like

485.72 --> 494.0
patterns are not actually

489.319 --> 494.0
part of it in a direct way

495.8 --> 503.36
it yeah I'm not I'm just just trying to

499.96 --> 506.28
figure it out apparently some people out

503.36 --> 509.639
there find this very

506.28 --> 511.88
Troublesome that I do that to the the

509.639 --> 514.519
point where they'd even call me a

511.88 --> 516.88
liar tell me that I'm deceiving my

514.519 --> 521.36
audience with that

516.88 --> 524.0
subject even though I'm obviously not

521.36 --> 527.519
I'm trying to figure it out and I'm

524.0 --> 527.519
having considerations and

528.36 --> 532.92
reconsiderations but yeah I mean I guess

530.8 --> 535.4399999999999
some people just suddenly become

532.92 --> 538.279
[ __ ] out of

535.44 --> 541.44
nowhere anyway all right we'll see if we

538.279 --> 541.4399999999999
could talk about it again today

541.68 --> 546.399
today all right do coffee

546.519 --> 550.8
here I'm kind of

548.56 --> 554.5999999999999
hungry so I'm going to take a bite of

550.8 --> 554.5999999999999
this Illuminati C

570.0 --> 575.2
hey borders boy first in chat good to

572.0 --> 575.2
see you

616.53 --> 620.519
[Music]

619.399 --> 623.44
right

620.519 --> 625.6
so roughly where my considerations are

623.44 --> 628.32
taking

625.6 --> 632.0
me is comparing for

628.32 --> 634.0790000000001
example water and water in

632.0 --> 636.12
waves with

634.079 --> 639.2399999999999
light

636.12 --> 642.079
right so there's

639.24 --> 646.839
waves happening to the

642.079 --> 646.8389999999999
water so is the wave the

649.519 --> 654.72
water no it's just kind of happening to

652.36 --> 654.72
it

654.959 --> 660.76
right the water is moving around though

662.839 --> 667.399
indirect response to the wave that's one

667.68 --> 673.959
thing but with

671.68 --> 678.0
light it's not

673.959 --> 679.7199999999999
moving but it's still waving apparently

678.0 --> 683.92
or you could think of it as

679.72 --> 683.9200000000001
such the whole frequency

684.959 --> 695.279
thing so is the light the wave

690.16 --> 695.279
or is a wave happening to the

706.44 --> 713.1600000000001
light or is there something going on

709.04 --> 717.76
like if there's no frequency to

713.16 --> 717.76
it it doesn't exist

723.8 --> 728.7199999999999
like could you like

725.959 --> 731.4399999999999
flatten the frequency of Light Within

728.72 --> 732.8000000000001
its theoretical model of of it as an

731.44 --> 735.72
oscillating

732.8 --> 739.3199999999999
wave I'm just wondering these things

735.72 --> 739.32
hello Steve windorf

754.5 --> 758.48
[Music]

756.12 --> 762.079
yeah cool little

758.48 --> 764.0790000000001
videos of that uh that helicopter ride

762.079 --> 767.079
in the

764.079 --> 770.3199999999999
glacier thanks for emailing me that

767.079 --> 770.3199999999999
Steve appreciate

777.32 --> 782.1600000000001
it right for

812.199 --> 816.399
being on a different planet I don't know

814.199 --> 820.4799999999999
why you say why you would say

816.399 --> 820.48
that that's a very strange

831.44 --> 839.639
statement what hello Tim explains what

835.759 --> 842.32
do you mean qwi sent you here

839.639 --> 842.32
how did that

847.519 --> 854.519
happen since when does QE send people

850.839 --> 854.519
over to my channel

869.56 --> 873.8389999999999
surface of the glaciers like no other

871.92 --> 875.8
place you have ever

873.839 --> 880.72
seen

875.8 --> 880.7199999999999
well didn't you just see it on

887.16 --> 894.36
Earth okay Tim my name came up but in

890.6 --> 894.36
context to what

913.839 --> 917.0
hello Jimbo

924.519 --> 930.5600000000001
con what do I think of why why

930.959 --> 934.7199999999999
why do I need to think something

935.079 --> 941.8
about that supposed debate are you why

938.48 --> 941.8000000000001
why are you so interested in

947.759 --> 953.36
it Joy was drunk okay

961.319 --> 966.16
weird I I heard

963.759 --> 971.24
that I think somebody brought that up

966.16 --> 971.24
yesterday too or the day before I don't

975.839 --> 983.2790000000001
remember you just finished watching that

978.36 --> 983.279
and now you're coming to me okay Jim hon

1002.68 --> 1009.12
he was throwing out a lot of names so Qi

1005.44 --> 1011.72
named me but in what sense uh you said

1009.12 --> 1013.36
you didn't know the exact content okay

1011.72 --> 1016.1990000000001
I'd like to know

1013.36 --> 1019.6
though I I hope I was in the list of

1016.199 --> 1021.399
flat earthers that get it and not that

1019.6 --> 1024.679
are nonsense

1021.399 --> 1028.4
talkers that might be a reason why qwi

1024.679 --> 1028.4
would name a list of Flat Earth

1030.4 --> 1035.3600000000001
people I have no idea what he thinks

1032.88 --> 1037.88
about me I get so incredible little

1035.36 --> 1040.3999999999999
feedback from the from those

1037.88 --> 1044.0390000000002
guys

1040.4 --> 1046.5590000000002
so like even when I was with them I got

1044.039 --> 1049.4
extremely little feedback and I had to

1046.559 --> 1051.6
like bring it up live to even get them

1049.4 --> 1054.2800000000002
to respond to

1051.6 --> 1056.52
anything I had to literally bring it up

1054.28 --> 1059.799
live on the Flat Earth debates to get a

1056.52 --> 1062.6
response from them like when I was still

1059.799 --> 1066.32
in that group so I get so little

1062.6 --> 1070.1999999999998
feedback I don't have a

1066.32 --> 1071.9189999999999
clue how they regard me other than

1070.2 --> 1076.24
probably a guy that's slightly

1071.919 --> 1076.24
emotionally unstable or something

1076.3 --> 1084.299
[Music]

1093.72 --> 1098.88
current is a result of voltage over

1101.48 --> 1106.32
resistance as far as I can actually

1104.6 --> 1110.36
understand it Steve

1106.32 --> 1113.6
windorf I mean

1110.36 --> 1115.28
yeah I I I do not agree with scientific

1113.6 --> 1119.1999999999998
consensus as

1115.28 --> 1123.799
a as a principle I

1119.2 --> 1123.799
mean scientific consensus is an

1126.919 --> 1133.96
oxymoron like it literally is like to

1129.88 --> 1136.7990000000002
say that is an oxymoron so yeah I

1133.96 --> 1139.799
definitely don't agree with oxymoronic

1136.799 --> 1139.799
statements

1140.159 --> 1147.0
right and as far as like all these

1142.12 --> 1152.799
electrical laws and all that yeah I am

1147.0 --> 1155.48
not I've never been super great at like

1152.799 --> 1158.52
electrics in the physics

1155.48 --> 1159.3600000000001
department I find it all very confusing

1158.52 --> 1161.6399999999999
and

1159.36 --> 1164.1589999999999
complicated and that I even had that

1161.64 --> 1166.1200000000001
issue like when I was like doing physics

1164.159 --> 1169.2
in

1166.12 --> 1172.4799999999998
school like I'm very interested in

1169.2 --> 1175.1200000000001
physics but some things I'm just not

1172.48 --> 1176.72
super great at and in a way what I'm

1175.12 --> 1180.2399999999998
doing right

1176.72 --> 1182.88
now having

1180.24 --> 1185.96
reconsiderations I'm actually trying to

1182.88 --> 1188.0
work through it again in order to

1185.96 --> 1190.919
potentially make me a little better at

1188.0 --> 1190.919
it

1191.44 --> 1196.48
because if you don't have the right

1193.44 --> 1199.2
angle of approach with your

1196.48 --> 1202.6
understanding things just don't connect

1199.2 --> 1205.0
up as you go through it with your

1202.6 --> 1207.6399999999999
Consciousness and that's like been a big

1205.0 --> 1210.96
issue and that's why I'm trying to

1207.64 --> 1214.2
reconfigure my angle of approach by

1210.96 --> 1216.799
going after the rudiment after the

1214.2 --> 1219.44
foundations of a lot of structural

1216.799 --> 1219.44
understanding within

1219.76 --> 1229.08
physics but it with with the yeah with

1225.12 --> 1231.6399999999999
in mind that it turns out that a lot

1229.08 --> 1234.32
that is in there and I would never have

1231.64 --> 1237.3200000000002
like been able to do that like 30 years

1234.32 --> 1241.039
ago and now I just realized there's a

1237.32 --> 1244.0
lot wrong there's so much wrong so I am

1241.039 --> 1245.96
now like okay if so much is

1244.0 --> 1249.44
wrong with the

1245.96 --> 1252.039
people in physics and with like how the

1249.44 --> 1252.039
knowledge is

1253.76 --> 1259.32
built then I just need to go at the

1256.48 --> 1262.76
foundations and like be really certain

1259.32 --> 1265.8799999999999
like turn over every stone of the

1262.76 --> 1270.72
foundation to be certain that it's

1265.88 --> 1270.72
real and not a cover

1276.2 --> 1280.72
story so in a way I'm like going after

1279.159 --> 1285.279
the foundations of

1280.72 --> 1289.64
physics but not to like oh it's all

1285.279 --> 1293.0
fake like not like oh

1289.64 --> 1295.5590000000002
atoms they're only a model so they don't

1293.0 --> 1300.12
exist and then everything that's based

1295.559 --> 1303.72
structurally on atomic theory has to be

1300.12 --> 1307.2399999999998
nonsense right like no no no

1303.72 --> 1311.2
no now I just figured out like yeah it's

1307.24 --> 1316.279
about ratios so the atoms is not about

1311.2 --> 1319.1200000000001
having the the ultimate singled out unit

1316.279 --> 1322.44
of the material it's about what the

1319.12 --> 1325.559
material does in relation to other

1322.44 --> 1329.799
material with a different structural

1325.559 --> 1333.8799999999999
configuration based on these theoretical

1329.799 --> 1336.2
parts and the ratio between those

1333.88 --> 1338.7600000000002
reactions is the thing that's actually

1336.2 --> 1339.88
being cataloged within chemistry and it

1338.76 --> 1343.12
works

1339.88 --> 1344.4
fantastically so it's like with all the

1343.12 --> 1346.76
chemical

1344.4 --> 1350.2
knowledge it's

1346.76 --> 1353.64
irrelevant whether an at is really a

1350.2 --> 1356.679
unit that you can single out it it

1353.64 --> 1359.5590000000002
literally is irrelevant in relation to

1356.679 --> 1362.0
how it reacts to other

1359.559 --> 1365.36
units and that's the thing that's being

1362.0 --> 1365.36
so effectively

1366.24 --> 1371.279
cataloged right so I

1371.64 --> 1378.5590000000002
am turning over these foundational

1374.76 --> 1380.48
stones to make sure they're real

1378.559 --> 1383.039
not to just destroy it and get it out of

1380.48 --> 1386.08
the way to reason it out of the way to

1383.039 --> 1390.679
say like H this entire thing is bad I'm

1386.08 --> 1393.96
just trying to like just try to really

1390.679 --> 1396.5590000000002
figure it out from scratch to get a a a

1393.96 --> 1401.2
a clearer view a less polluted

1396.559 --> 1401.2
convoluted view on the whole of

1404.279 --> 1408.279
it anyway

1409.44 --> 1417.0
it's pretty yeah Steve W sure OHS law I

1413.039 --> 1418.919
mean it does sound basic and sensible I

1417.0 --> 1422.36
I I don't think there's anything

1418.919 --> 1422.3600000000001
directly against

1428.76 --> 1435.4
it right it it's a pretty basic formula

1432.039 --> 1439.679
pretty straightforward I

1435.4 --> 1442.2
guess so but yeah the it's

1439.679 --> 1444.44
another

1442.2 --> 1448.6000000000001
Direction I'm more interested in the

1444.44 --> 1448.6000000000001
nature of light and radio and all that

1449.2 --> 1455.0800000000002
and wave

1451.48 --> 1457.0
patterns if something has wave patterns

1455.08 --> 1460.72
is it a

1457.0 --> 1463.0
wave light

1460.72 --> 1468.64
research and well

1463.0 --> 1468.64
Cy among others say no

1468.88 --> 1475.679
but it can have wave attributes so if

1471.72 --> 1479.48
things can be not be a wave but have

1475.679 --> 1482.64
wave attributes as part of its

1479.48 --> 1484.64
existence that's really

1482.64 --> 1486.76
confusing

1484.64 --> 1489.7990000000002
and by

1486.76 --> 1492.64
necessity based on that viewpoint on

1489.799 --> 1496.399
that discovery about

1492.64 --> 1499.919
it realization I have to then move on to

1496.399 --> 1505.1589999999999
radio because radio is so close it's

1499.919 --> 1505.159
like on the same Spectrum you can like

1505.36 --> 1513.279
mechanically alter light frequency and

1509.12 --> 1513.279
turn it into radio and the other way

1522.799 --> 1529.2
around so because of

1525.6 --> 1531.8799999999999
that yeah I mean radio wave

1529.2 --> 1535.0800000000002
you think of it as a wave it's Rippling

1531.88 --> 1537.6000000000001
out right it's so easy to think of it

1535.08 --> 1537.6
like that

1538.2 --> 1547.72
and but is it really a wave like does it

1544.08 --> 1550.799
radio have a speed or is it more

1547.72 --> 1554.08
like a

1550.799 --> 1557.84
field can you compare it almost to like

1554.08 --> 1558.84
Sonic simatic resonance right cuz what

1557.84 --> 1560.1999999999998
is that

1558.84 --> 1563.52
it's a

1560.2 --> 1567.039
specific place like a container that's

1563.52 --> 1571.32
being subjected to Sonic frequencies

1567.039 --> 1574.679
which causes these waves

1571.32 --> 1577.1589999999999
effectively it's not moving around but

1574.679 --> 1580.52
everything inside of it is being divided

1577.159 --> 1582.3990000000001
into waves right causing lower pressure

1580.52 --> 1587.1589999999999
higher pressure within the the pressure

1582.399 --> 1587.1589999999999
system the gases that's simatics

1591.0 --> 1597.88
but it's like it's not moving

1593.88 --> 1600.96
though this thing is not moving it's

1597.88 --> 1603.5590000000002
basically being oscillated as a

1600.96 --> 1606.039
whole there's nothing moving it's not

1603.559 --> 1609.52
like oh it's moving that direction no

1606.039 --> 1614.24
it's the whole thing is being

1609.52 --> 1615.559
subjected to vibration I guess in a way

1614.24 --> 1618.84
which causes the whole thing to

1615.559 --> 1624.48
oscillate and that's simatic so is that

1618.84 --> 1628.12
more what's happening with light and

1624.48 --> 1629.6
radio is it more like a field it's just

1628.12 --> 1633.32
the whole thing

1629.6 --> 1635.8799999999999
like the radio the light it goes this

1633.32 --> 1638.399
far before it gets absorbed it's just

1635.88 --> 1642.7600000000002
boom this is the range it's like this

1638.399 --> 1647.9189999999999
giant field like the range of light

1642.76 --> 1647.919
sources or radio sources can be

1648.84 --> 1654.9599999999998
described or

1651.48 --> 1657.88
visualized like a

1654.96 --> 1661.44
field and then within that

1657.88 --> 1665.279
field any signal or light patterns light

1661.44 --> 1668.3990000000001
communication theoretically is almost

1665.279 --> 1671.519
like this simatics thing it's just the

1668.399 --> 1673.7199999999998
whole field is just like oscillating in

1671.519 --> 1673.72
a

1676.08 --> 1683.9189999999999
way with yeah with the frequency

1679.0 --> 1687.08
information but it's not because it's

1683.919 --> 1690.159
moving cuz it's pretty much

1687.08 --> 1694.399
instantaneous and like the actual travel

1690.159 --> 1696.2
speed of radio and light to me seem

1694.399 --> 1698.399
pretty much

1696.2 --> 1702.0
theoretical like the only thing that

1698.399 --> 1705.12
really has a like tangible

1702.0 --> 1708.399
speed is sound waves that's why there's

1705.12 --> 1711.4799999999998
a sound barrier

1708.399 --> 1715.76
because there's like actual palpable

1711.48 --> 1718.679
effects because of the speed right you

1715.76 --> 1721.039
move at the speed of sound and then like

1718.679 --> 1724.159
the sound

1721.039 --> 1728.399
Ripple becomes parallel with the object

1724.159 --> 1731.5590000000002
which causes like more sound Ripple

1728.399 --> 1733.799
Force to gather up in it and that's why

1731.559 --> 1735.24
when it goes fast there's a boom because

1733.799 --> 1738.679
it's like all this

1735.24 --> 1742.48
ripples this Rippling is being like

1738.679 --> 1742.48
compacted in front of the

1742.76 --> 1747.44
object the sound is being compacted

1745.519 --> 1749.559
because the object is traveling just as

1747.44 --> 1752.919
fast as the sound while it's creating

1749.559 --> 1754.519
sound and so more sound ripples just

1752.919 --> 1756.5590000000002
gather right in front of it as it's

1754.519 --> 1759.679
speeding

1756.559 --> 1763.2
right but that's only with

1759.679 --> 1765.96
sound yeah all these other things speed

1763.2 --> 1769.24
is just purely

1765.96 --> 1773.32
theoretical what do you mean speed of

1769.24 --> 1773.32
radio what do you mean speed of

1779.0 --> 1784.84
light tangible and very measurable speed

1782.679 --> 1789.0800000000002
with equipment yeah yeah you need a

1784.84 --> 1794.399
man-made device to tell you that I'm

1789.08 --> 1797.519
sure Steve Winder you just I mean yeah

1794.399 --> 1799.84
man and we also sent a radio signal to

1797.519 --> 1802.76
the Moon

1799.84 --> 1805.519
yeah you bounced it off yeah that story

1802.76 --> 1805.519
goes around

1805.64 --> 1811.88
too right just like oh you can measure

1808.76 --> 1816.6
it we have the equipment yeah no no I'm

1811.88 --> 1816.6000000000001
I'm not buying it I'm not buying that at

1823.44 --> 1828.919
all right but hey if if you need

1826.559 --> 1831.76
equipment to tell you that something is

1828.919 --> 1836.159
a a

1831.76 --> 1838.48
wave then by all means but like it's not

1836.159 --> 1841.3990000000001
relevant to what I'm trying to figure

1838.48 --> 1842.88
out here which is like the rudimentary

1841.399 --> 1845.559
nature of

1842.88 --> 1847.3990000000001
it and there's something going on with

1845.559 --> 1850.76
light and

1847.399 --> 1850.76
radio it's

1853.24 --> 1858.3990000000001
different right and the main indicator

1859.799 --> 1864.679
is that changing the frequency doesn't

1862.32 --> 1867.9189999999999
change the

1864.679 --> 1871.799
speed logically there should like in

1867.919 --> 1875.1200000000001
your childish playful mind that's really

1871.799 --> 1877.9189999999999
this like not set in its ways there

1875.12 --> 1881.9599999999998
should be an immediate light going off

1877.919 --> 1883.96
in your head like oh wait speed doesn't

1881.96 --> 1885.559
influence it's not influenced by the

1883.96 --> 1887.44
frequency you change the frequency the

1885.559 --> 1889.559
speed doesn't change it should

1887.44 --> 1893.0800000000002
immediately medely tell you oh so

1889.559 --> 1895.84
they're separated

1893.08 --> 1898.9189999999999
then it's

1895.84 --> 1901.48
separated it's another

1898.919 --> 1904.3200000000002
thing that's what I realized yesterday

1901.48 --> 1904.32
when I figured that

1913.08 --> 1918.72
out changing the frequency changes the

1916.72 --> 1921.48
way it's the same thing frequency

1918.72 --> 1924.32
wavelength is literally the same

1921.48 --> 1927.559
thing so yeah if you change one thing

1924.32 --> 1930.96
then that one thing is changed

1927.559 --> 1934.24
yeah and that's not a logical conclusion

1930.96 --> 1936.039
to say that that is a reason yeah that

1934.24 --> 1937.919
changing something changes that

1936.039 --> 1939.639
something that yeah that's not a reason

1937.919 --> 1944.519
why the speed remains constant that

1939.639 --> 1944.519
makes no sense Steve window I'm

1946.12 --> 1950.399
sorry yeah you can

1948.44 --> 1951.24
repeat yourself it still doesn't make

1950.399 --> 1955.0
any

1951.24 --> 1956.559
sense like there's no logical sense in

1955.0 --> 1961.159
that

1956.559 --> 1961.1589999999999
statement it's not a reason

1995.96 --> 2000.0
okay there's just going to be a bunch of

1997.84 --> 2002.4399999999998
ass wipes in my chat just whining and

2000.0 --> 2005.399
bitching about how ridiculous it is what

2002.44 --> 2007.559
I'm doing I'm just going to kick you out

2005.399 --> 2012.1999999999998
though right if it's just whining and

2007.559 --> 2015.279
bit ing like I don't care how offended

2012.2 --> 2015.279
you are by what I

2015.559 --> 2021.76
do okay I'll just kick you out because I

2019.6 --> 2024.799
I can just have this conversation all by

2021.76 --> 2027.0
myself it's nice to have people actually

2024.799 --> 2030.679
responding to what I'm saying during the

2027.0 --> 2032.48
live show for a change it's nice but if

2030.679 --> 2034.919
it's just whining and bitching because

2032.48 --> 2037.44
you think it's ridiculous what that what

2034.919 --> 2039.039
I'm doing and what I'm considering then

2037.44 --> 2041.1200000000001
I have absolutely no problem just

2039.039 --> 2044.96
Banning you for that yeah because I

2041.12 --> 2048.799
don't need somebody in the chat to have

2044.96 --> 2048.799
this talk with myself

2113.52 --> 2118.04
okay Steve wind yeah that's very nice I

2115.92 --> 2118.04
get

2120.68 --> 2127.0
it what I'm just pointing at is

2124.04 --> 2129.64
how that thing that you see think is

2127.0 --> 2129.64
just so normal

2130.88 --> 2137.599
how it basically

2132.56 --> 2137.599
disconnects the wave from the actual

2138.04 --> 2146.0
thing light or radio in this case like a

2142.28 --> 2150.92
wave is happening to

2146.0 --> 2155.56
it but it's not a wave though it's just

2150.92 --> 2155.56
like a wave is happening to it

2158.839 --> 2163.16
but it's like the wave itself is

2164.96 --> 2169.76
not the movement like the movement of it

2168.24 --> 2173.04
is not the

2169.76 --> 2176.2400000000002
wave it's just it's

2173.04 --> 2179.0
waving it in its hole is waving it's

2176.24 --> 2179.0
just not

2179.96 --> 2187.119
moving as a wave it's not like a water

2184.2 --> 2190.48
wave on the beach coming ashore

2187.119 --> 2190.48
literally moving

2201.16 --> 2204.7999999999997
there hello Richie

2211.839 --> 2220.0789999999997
G it's only because you can see it oh

2214.8 --> 2220.079
really so that makes it different I'm

2222.23 --> 2225.329
[Music]

2225.72 --> 2230.24
sorry love stun monkey

2267.16 --> 2276.0
you can see sound waves oh really no you

2270.52 --> 2276.0
can you can actually see sound waves

2293.52 --> 2302.44
I mean a shock wave from an explosion is

2297.76 --> 2302.44
a sound wave it's pretty damn visible

2309.88 --> 2314.6800000000003
a water wave doesn't move either water

2313.0 --> 2319.04
goes up and

2314.68 --> 2319.04
down oh really Zone

2322.16 --> 2328.44
monkey back to differ I mean I've been

2325.119 --> 2329.8
at the beach plenty of times and uh yeah

2328.44 --> 2334.0
that water

2329.8 --> 2335.88
wave it doesn't just go up and down it

2334.0 --> 2338.119
goes onto the

2335.88 --> 2341.599
beach and goes

2338.119 --> 2341.599
back to the

2346.16 --> 2350.92
ocean that's not just up and

2360.72 --> 2366.359
down leader right so it doesn't just go

2365.28 --> 2369.3590000000004
up and

2366.359 --> 2369.359
down

2396.319 --> 2403.42
for for

2400.29 --> 2403.42
[Music]

2456.24 --> 2460.2799999999997
e for

2495.839 --> 2500.72
wave is disturbing water as it moves

2497.76 --> 2500.7200000000003
through yeah that's

2516.24 --> 2520.16
interesting for

2548.079 --> 2551.8390000000004
right sound wave disturbs the air as it

2550.64 --> 2555.359
moves through

2551.839 --> 2558.92
it yeah and now with

2555.359 --> 2562.0
light does light and radio disturb the

2558.92 --> 2562.0
air as it moves

2564.76 --> 2571.4
through it doesn't it really doesn't in

2568.079 --> 2571.4
any way

2596.68 --> 2605.5589999999997
right and a sound wave can't

2600.96 --> 2608.48
move through the vacuum but light and

2605.559 --> 2611.599
radio can

2608.48 --> 2615.44
or I don't know if like radio yeah I

2611.599 --> 2615.44
think so radio can actually do

2616.92 --> 2620.4
it but not

2628.04 --> 2632.2799999999997
well light is a different Beast harder

2630.559 --> 2634.8
to yeah but that's the whole point of

2632.28 --> 2637.3590000000004
what I'm trying to achieve here Steve

2634.8 --> 2639.28
Windor I am looking into the nature of

2637.359 --> 2644.16
light and

2639.28 --> 2644.1600000000003
radio and the claims of it being a

2645.079 --> 2651.6400000000003
wave why that

2647.52 --> 2651.64
is and if it is

2652.24 --> 2656.52
really

2653.76 --> 2658.599
waving like if it is the

2656.52 --> 2662.599
wave

2658.599 --> 2666.04
or if it just has wave

2662.599 --> 2670.079
attributes and it's not really a

2666.04 --> 2670.079
wave for

2700.8 --> 2706.8
all right so I'm just going to

2703.52 --> 2709.68
have thought

2706.8 --> 2711.28
experiment right so something that's

2709.68 --> 2715.96
waving like

2711.28 --> 2718.7200000000003
water if you have no waves happening no

2715.96 --> 2721.7200000000003
the water is still

2718.72 --> 2724.48
there so how do that work like with

2721.72 --> 2728.24
light can you have like light that

2724.48 --> 2730.92
doesn't have a frequency

2728.24 --> 2730.9199999999996
how does that

2739.079 --> 2745.8390000000004
work right or it's

2742.119 --> 2749.04
like you don't have light without a

2745.839 --> 2751.72
frequency the frequency is what makes

2749.04 --> 2753.8
the light manifest and like everything

2751.72 --> 2755.64
you have you change it make a higher

2753.8 --> 2757.76
frequency lower frequency and then you

2755.64 --> 2761.48
change the nature of the

2757.76 --> 2761.48
light what it looks

2762.64 --> 2769.4
like but you can't like neutralize the

2767.359 --> 2771.88
frequency about it cuz then you don't

2769.4 --> 2771.88
have any

2781.16 --> 2786.2
light or you just like that would be

2784.079 --> 2790.0
effectively like smothering the light

2786.2 --> 2793.0
like turning it off lowering

2790.0 --> 2794.52
it like the amplitude right higher

2793.0 --> 2798.8
amplitude more

2794.52 --> 2801.48
intense lower amplitude more

2798.8 --> 2806.44
vague to the point where if there's no

2801.48 --> 2806.44
amplitude then there's like no light

2825.68 --> 2829.8799999999997
radio waves are definitely waves

2830.4 --> 2837.079
what if it acts both like but that

2833.92 --> 2839.599
doesn't make any [ __ ] sense that

2837.079 --> 2841.8390000000004
statement makes no damn

2839.599 --> 2844.2000000000003
sense yeah that's the whole point that's

2841.839 --> 2848.24
like the reason why I'm doing this

2844.2 --> 2851.4399999999996
because of these stupid stupid it

2848.24 --> 2853.72
as supposedly smart statements about

2851.44 --> 2859.44
light being like a particle and a wave

2853.72 --> 2859.4399999999996
it's it's annoying it's stupid it's

2874.88 --> 2881.319
pointless frequency amplitude length

2878.52 --> 2881.319
frequency

2884.04 --> 2890.0
distance no no no that's not a right

2887.16 --> 2893.52
description the frequency would

2890.0 --> 2896.16
be the division between the distance and

2893.52 --> 2901.559
the amplitude

2896.16 --> 2901.5589999999997
is the strength of it

2906.96 --> 2914.92
distance between yeah

2911.76 --> 2917.1600000000003
distance yeah I guess that you can scbe

2914.92 --> 2917.16
like

2917.28 --> 2925.48
that what I just right okay yeah well I

2921.4 --> 2925.48
said it before you wrote it down

2928.04 --> 2933.4
so oh I don't seem to have to answer oh

2930.76 --> 2935.6400000000003
what so I have to stop asking questions

2933.4 --> 2939.6800000000003
I don't have the answer yet oh well then

2935.64 --> 2942.68
don't ever never start then no what a

2939.68 --> 2947.2799999999997
ridiculous thing to

2942.68 --> 2947.2799999999997
say I'm definitely not done

2965.72 --> 2969.68
here for

3018.319 --> 3025.2799999999997
I have not yet figured out okay could be

3021.4 --> 3028.28
no it can't be it makes no

3025.28 --> 3031.8390000000004
sense it can't be

3028.28 --> 3034.599
two opposing things at the same time

3031.839 --> 3036.799
yeah that's the whole point and that's

3034.599 --> 3038.559
like oh oh it's a paradox how

3036.799 --> 3042.599
interesting it's a paradox yeah that

3038.559 --> 3046.0400000000004
means it's wrong it isn't a paradox if

3042.599 --> 3048.6800000000003
it's paradoxes don't exist that's the

3046.04 --> 3051.599
entire point of a

3048.68 --> 3054.24
paradox it can't be

3051.599 --> 3057.319
that if that's the conclusion you're

3054.24 --> 3059.5989999999997
going to rest with you're you're resting

3057.319 --> 3064.2
with a paradox that means you're at a

3059.599 --> 3064.2000000000003
dead end and you have not figured it

3084.44 --> 3090.68
out do I believe light is made up of

3087.68 --> 3090.68
photons

3091.48 --> 3095.799
no no photon is just a

3096.52 --> 3104.52
concept it's just a convention based

3100.2 --> 3106.1189999999997
concept based on the electromagnetic

3104.52 --> 3108.16
interaction

3106.119 --> 3110.799
with with

3108.16 --> 3115.44
matter it's the minimum

3110.799 --> 3119.88
amount of light energy required in order

3115.44 --> 3124.2400000000002
for the a photoelectric effect to

3119.88 --> 3124.2400000000002
transpire that's it that's all it

3126.119 --> 3129.839
is it's just a

3134.68 --> 3142.5589999999997
convention now it's it's not a

3138.799 --> 3144.88
unit it doesn't have a location cuz it's

3142.559 --> 3144.88
not

3145.52 --> 3148.52
traveling

3175.44 --> 3179.48
for for

3193.29 --> 3196.42
[Music]

3210.4 --> 3215.88
what photons have been detected and

3212.64 --> 3215.8799999999997
measured oh yeah

3217.04 --> 3224.2799999999997
sure measured yeah you measured a photon

3221.599 --> 3224.28
I'm sure you

3232.88 --> 3238.92
did yeah what that means yeah I but you

3236.599 --> 3242.2400000000002
don't seem to understand what it means

3238.92 --> 3245.44
yeah detecting measuring a photon yeah

3242.24 --> 3248.68
you don't measure a photon what you do

3245.44 --> 3251.48
is you have a photoelectric

3248.68 --> 3254.5989999999997
plate that's very sensitive very

3251.48 --> 3256.559
specific in the amount that

3254.599 --> 3259.559
triggers that

3256.559 --> 3264.0400000000004
effect and then it

3259.559 --> 3266.44
registers the absorption of that quanta

3264.04 --> 3269.2799999999997
of light in order for it for the photo

3266.44 --> 3272.48
electric effect to trigger and then you

3269.28 --> 3275.0400000000004
detect the triggering that's all it

3272.48 --> 3278.28
is

3275.04 --> 3282.2799999999997
yeah to say photons have been detected

3278.28 --> 3285.0
and measured it's like oh look I found a

3282.28 --> 3289.3590000000004
photon in this old

3285.0 --> 3292.64
Vault like it's an object yeah no

3289.359 --> 3294.839
no that's not happening at

3292.64 --> 3298.8799999999997
all yeah it's not

3294.839 --> 3302.68
isolated it's not detected as a

3298.88 --> 3305.04
unit it's basically after the fact

3302.68 --> 3309.52
derived it's like

3305.04 --> 3313.24
hey there is a piece of material that's

3309.52 --> 3316.799
responded conclusion drawn is well it

3313.24 --> 3319.04
requires a discrete amount of light to

3316.799 --> 3321.64
trigger that

3319.04 --> 3325.0
material it's a photoelectric effect

3321.64 --> 3327.64
conclusion is there was a discrete

3325.0 --> 3330.599
amount of light there that arrived right

3327.64 --> 3334.0789999999997
there yeah that's how that works yeah

3330.599 --> 3337.3590000000004
you didn't isolate a

3334.079 --> 3341.2000000000003
photon you didn't measure a

3337.359 --> 3343.92
photon you had a photoelectric effect

3341.2 --> 3346.4399999999996
take place from which you can draw the

3343.92 --> 3350.359
conclusion that enough

3346.44 --> 3352.92
light AR yeah gathered there manifested

3350.359 --> 3357.64
there in order for that effect to

3352.92 --> 3357.64
transpire that's how that works

3380.52 --> 3385.16
same as photo on film

3392.359 --> 3400.92
what that's how photons are

3395.799 --> 3405.079
measured yeah yeah now it's

3400.92 --> 3405.079
derived yeah you don't measure a

3407.4 --> 3411.1600000000003
photon cuz you

3413.44 --> 3419.76
can't you can only

3416.559 --> 3423.6800000000003
after the fact figure out it was

3419.76 --> 3426.96
there through the photoelectric effect

3423.68 --> 3426.96
that's it

3462.079 --> 3465.079
what

3480.599 --> 3483.039
what the

3494.119 --> 3500.599
[ __ ] oh

3496.559 --> 3503.799
great my Channel's not approved for

3500.599 --> 3506.319
monetization harmful content it refuses

3503.799 --> 3509.72
to point at what exactly is like like

3506.319 --> 3513.4
what do you is YouTube Just expecting me

3509.72 --> 3514.839
to like delete everything that I made

3513.4 --> 3516.7200000000003
and then it then it's going to be

3514.839 --> 3519.7599999999998
approved for monetization again because

3516.72 --> 3521.72
it it just won't tell me what the

3519.76 --> 3524.6400000000003
[ __ ] harmful content

3521.72 --> 3526.16
is it just doesn't tell me it's like oh

3524.64 --> 3528.96
no you have harmful

3526.16 --> 3530.92
content what what what's the harmful

3528.96 --> 3533.119
content well we're not going to tell you

3530.92 --> 3534.28
just you have to guess just just delete

3533.119 --> 3537.119
all your

3534.28 --> 3539.0
work and then eventually there won't be

3537.119 --> 3543.1600000000003
any harmful

3539.0 --> 3543.16
content what the [ __ ] is this

3550.799 --> 3555.24
[ __ ] and I'm freaking

3565.039 --> 3569.079
distracted e

3603.96 --> 3606.96
that

3633.92 --> 3636.92
that

3671.799 --> 3678.079
all right let's just start with this

3674.72 --> 3682.5589999999997
light and radio wave or wave attributes

3678.079 --> 3687.799
let's just start you probably figure out

3682.559 --> 3690.559
a better title physics early bird

3687.799 --> 3690.559
yeah a

3693.839 --> 3700.7599999999998
little well maybe maybe not maybe I'm

3697.76 --> 3702.96
going to take the moment here to remind

3700.76 --> 3704.6400000000003
everybody on how the Earth is measured

3702.96 --> 3707.079
navigated

3704.64 --> 3710.5589999999997
calculated and perceived

3707.079 --> 3714.319
Flat Earth is flat it's not a sphere

3710.559 --> 3717.039
there's no geometric Horizon yeah you

3714.319 --> 3719.7599999999998
can't have a gas pressure system next to

3717.039 --> 3723.1600000000003
a vacuum Earth is

3719.76 --> 3726.599
stationary yeah there is no

3723.16 --> 3730.1189999999997
motion that's physically happening or

3726.599 --> 3732.52
coris effect that's taking place because

3730.119 --> 3736.319
the Earth is stationary and it's not a

3732.52 --> 3736.319
rotating ball

3737.799 --> 3742.52
right could talk about all that I could

3740.76 --> 3746.0
talk about it all day long it's just

3742.52 --> 3749.799
that I'm right now in the middle of

3746.0 --> 3749.799
physics I'm trying to figure out

3750.839 --> 3757.44
physics and it's tough It's really tough

3753.599 --> 3757.44
to even concentrate on this

3757.839 --> 3763.96
[ __ ] but I want to understand

3761.64 --> 3766.839
it like I want

3763.96 --> 3771.16
to be able to

3766.839 --> 3774.0
know all these assumptions and positions

3771.16 --> 3776.319
you can take in relation to these

3774.0 --> 3779.64
assumptions cuz I don't want want to

3776.319 --> 3783.799
choose some kind of vantage point in an

3779.64 --> 3786.48
argument without absolutely knowing that

3783.799 --> 3788.96
it is the right vantage

3786.48 --> 3791.079
point I don't want to like take any

3788.96 --> 3793.76
position anymore in with in which there

3791.079 --> 3797.88
is any level of

3793.76 --> 3797.88
uncertainty I want to understand

3798.88 --> 3805.92
it online Physics course [ __ ] off Steve

3802.92 --> 3805.92
windorf

3806.359 --> 3813.359
dude I could give online physics

3810.68 --> 3816.359
courses this is

3813.359 --> 3816.359
ridiculous

3819.88 --> 3827.079
yeah this research there is no online

3824.52 --> 3829.48
research like this yeah there's only oh

3827.079 --> 3831.6400000000003
here's how you learn that it is a wave

3829.48 --> 3833.96
and this is exactly how you assume it's

3831.64 --> 3836.1189999999997
a wave yeah that that's that's the

3833.96 --> 3838.68
extent

3836.119 --> 3841.6800000000003
where physics courses are going to bring

3838.68 --> 3841.68
you

3846.279 --> 3853.72
okay no I want to figure it

3849.4 --> 3857.799
out do I give you could give on yeah but

3853.72 --> 3862.64
I don't I have this live show

3857.799 --> 3862.64
yeah this this is what I do

3866.68 --> 3872.279
please support me that would be great

3869.96 --> 3875.279
yeah I'm technically doing it for free

3872.279 --> 3878.599
you could just like be part of the chat

3875.279 --> 3881.4
and not pay for it but you you

3878.599 --> 3884.44
could graciously support me through the

3881.4 --> 3885.6800000000003
PayPal and actually give me something

3884.44 --> 3888.359
for my

3885.68 --> 3890.7599999999998
efforts right YouTube certainly isn't

3888.359 --> 3893.48
giving me anything for my effort since

3890.76 --> 3896.96
it refuses to monetize my my channel

3893.48 --> 3899.92
again because of harmful content that it

3896.96 --> 3905.52
refuses to point

3899.92 --> 3905.52
out yeah it refuses to point it

3909.48 --> 3914.72
out do I even care if I monetized

3919.76 --> 3925.76
yeah yeah it matters

3922.76 --> 3928.4
because if it's monetized then I have

3925.76 --> 3933.3190000000004
something to report to

3928.4 --> 3937.319
them right I don't want to like every

3933.319 --> 3939.4
month of the year for for like who knows

3937.319 --> 3942.319
how many years just tell them like yeah

3939.4 --> 3944.44
I didn't make any

3942.319 --> 3946.079
anything right because at some point

3944.44 --> 3948.52
they're going to be like okay you're

3946.079 --> 3950.7200000000003
going to have to try something

3948.52 --> 3953.16
else

3950.72 --> 3955.0
because you're literally wasting

3953.16 --> 3957.64
everybody's time that that's how they're

3955.0 --> 3957.64
going to regard

3964.799 --> 3972.4
that right and besides like I

3969.44 --> 3975.64
want it's not like I want super chats

3972.4 --> 3978.359
it's like I want the monetization for

3975.64 --> 3982.0
the ads I mean that's why I did

3978.359 --> 3984.96
it ad money like I could make decent ad

3982.0 --> 3987.559
money like it's not a lot but it's

3984.96 --> 3987.559
something

3988.72 --> 3994.839
and now it's just nothing because of

3991.319 --> 3996.64
harmful content that they refuse to

3994.839 --> 3999.0789999999997
point out what that

3996.64 --> 4001.64
is well you're just going to have to

3999.079 --> 4005.319
randomly delete your own

4001.64 --> 4007.839
[ __ ] until oh yeah oh well yeah the

4005.319 --> 4010.96
harmful content is gone you have no

4007.839 --> 4013.279
content all the harmful content is gone

4010.96 --> 4015.599
and I'm sure that as soon as I did any

4013.279 --> 4017.44
new video they'd immediately demand

4015.599 --> 4019.76
monetize me again because of harmful

4017.44 --> 4022.079
content because every [ __ ] thing I do

4019.76 --> 4025.3190000000004
apparently is harmful content now it

4022.079 --> 4030.3590000000004
refuses to point at out what exactly the

4025.319 --> 4030.359
harmful content is and I don't get

4040.359 --> 4046.0389999999998
monetized back up all your Fe

4617.94 --> 4621.28
[Music]

4619.52 --> 4625.0
I mean do I need to remind everybody

4621.28 --> 4625.0
that I literally was

4625.12 --> 4632.36
hallucinating from the [ __ ] stress

4627.6 --> 4635.56
dealing with these people yeah literal H

4632.36 --> 4636.92
fullblown hallucinations nightmarish

4635.56 --> 4640.2390000000005
full-blown

4636.92 --> 4643.4800000000005
hallucinations from having to suppress

4640.239 --> 4645.959999999999
the stress of dealing with them to move

4643.48 --> 4648.799999999999
on

4645.96 --> 4648.8
yeah it's

4650.36 --> 4656.36
done NE is jealous of me what is he

4654.159 --> 4658.92
still je why why the [ __ ] would he be

4656.36 --> 4661.719
jealous of

4658.92 --> 4664.12
me like I haven't even been there in

4661.719 --> 4664.12
half a

4673.84 --> 4684.12
year when I was on the show oh

4677.679 --> 4684.12
sure dude I'm just I'm so done with it

4726.719 --> 4729.96
so yeah I mean that's not going to

4728.239 --> 4733.44
happen again and I'm sure I'll talk

4729.96 --> 4736.28
about Flat Earth I mean I

4733.44 --> 4739.678999999999
can I'm veteran in

4736.28 --> 4742.36
that like and there's still issues with

4739.679 --> 4742.36
flat Earth

4746.52 --> 4751.76
assumptions right but I mean people I

4750.28 --> 4756.679
don't

4751.76 --> 4756.679
know they're just not as interested

4767.96 --> 4772.8
and in the meantime there's still a lot

4769.96 --> 4776.719
to be figured out about

4772.8 --> 4780.4800000000005
physics and what appears to

4776.719 --> 4784.0
be incorrect assumptions within it that

4780.48 --> 4784.0
have been integrated

4798.159 --> 4803.638999999999
right so that's yeah that's what I do I

4800.44 --> 4805.678999999999
mean that's if I'm interested in some

4803.639 --> 4807.32
subject and I will start testing it and

4805.679 --> 4808.76
I will start figuring out and then I

4807.32 --> 4810.88
have to deal with a bunch of people that

4808.76 --> 4813.12
tell me like oh you're lying you're

4810.88 --> 4815.719
deceiving your audience like no I'm

4813.12 --> 4818.719
trying to figure something out I'm

4815.719 --> 4818.719
reconsidering

4819.199 --> 4825.678999999999
things and suddenly now I'm the Badman

4822.639 --> 4828.36
and and people that's supposedly where

4825.679 --> 4831.2390000000005
my friends suddenly turn into [ __ ]

4828.36 --> 4833.5599999999995
trolls just like teret I mean what's

4831.239 --> 4835.839999999999
going on is like Satan making his rounds

4833.56 --> 4839.52
and just like oh let's see who's close

4835.84 --> 4841.8
to Arwin H is it enough time okay time

4839.52 --> 4844.280000000001
to take their soul and turn them into

4841.8 --> 4846.320000000001
complete [ __ ] monsters out of

4844.28 --> 4848.759999999999
nowhere

4846.32 --> 4851.239
like that's that seems to be what's

4848.76 --> 4854.84
happening here like all these people

4851.239 --> 4858.239
that I thought were my friends they L

4854.84 --> 4861.04
turn into like Psychopathic

4858.239 --> 4863.32
monsters so I don't I don't know why

4861.04 --> 4863.32
that's

4863.52 --> 4870.120000000001
happening maybe I just get too intense

4867.239 --> 4872.638999999999
with what I do and it just it just

4870.12 --> 4875.679
summons demons forth in people I don't

4872.639 --> 4878.719
know may maybe that is what's happening

4875.679 --> 4881.2390000000005
maybe these people are just turning into

4878.719 --> 4883.12
[ __ ] demons because I summoned those

4881.239 --> 4886.08
demons in them by

4883.12 --> 4888.239
accident or maybe I intend to I mean

4886.08 --> 4891.04
sometimes I do have like this weird

4888.239 --> 4893.32
impulse where I'm just like just come

4891.04 --> 4895.4
and get me already like I'm so [ __ ]

4893.32 --> 4898.4
sick of this world I just sometimes I

4895.4 --> 4900.36
wish that somebody would just like in a

4898.4 --> 4901.96
rage come at me and just try to kill me

4900.36 --> 4905.239
or

4901.96 --> 4908.44
something cuz I'm so sick of this

4905.239 --> 4910.678999999999
[ __ ] world in so many

4908.44 --> 4914.96
ways and and maybe that's what they're

4910.679 --> 4918.719
responding to I I don't know

4914.96 --> 4922.96
I get mad at people if I

4918.719 --> 4922.96
disagree if they disagree with

4924.48 --> 4930.32
me

4927.28 --> 4932.719
sometimes right but but it all depends

4930.32 --> 4934.92
um how they're going to disagree with me

4932.719 --> 4938.199
like if there's some kind of

4934.92 --> 4940.32
like disagreement then they can like lay

4938.199 --> 4943.28
that

4940.32 --> 4946.5199999999995
down it's but a lot of it is just has to

4943.28 --> 4946.5199999999995
do with timing

4947.88 --> 4951.28
right I mean when it's obvious I'm

4949.36 --> 4954.199
trying to figure something

4951.28 --> 4956.199
out and they just like brace against me

4954.199 --> 4959.4
and just say like no you're just wrong

4956.199 --> 4962.28
I'm right you're just wrong and they

4959.4 --> 4964.4
just don't want to give me the room to

4962.28 --> 4965.84
try to figure it out yeah well that's

4964.4 --> 4968.159
very

4965.84 --> 4971.159000000001
agitating like why are you obstructing

4968.159 --> 4971.159
me why are you doing

4971.199 --> 4977.839999999999
that I mean if if these things are so

4975.48 --> 4979.959999999999
absolutely certain why would you have

4977.84 --> 4982.159000000001
objections against

4979.96 --> 4984.76
me

4982.159 --> 4987.839999999999
reconsidering right if my

4984.76 --> 4991.400000000001
reconsideration is just wrong then

4987.84 --> 4993.679
wouldn't it inevitably fall back to what

4991.4 --> 4993.679
is

4995.32 --> 4999.84
real isn't that how that works you just

4998.159 --> 5001.5599999999995
like you test something it turns out

4999.84 --> 5006.400000000001
you're wrong and then you move on and

5001.56 --> 5006.400000000001
you move back to what is real I mean

5012.4 --> 5018.799999999999
maybe they have it figured out and want

5015.6 --> 5018.8
to help you

5024.6 --> 5027.6
understand

5027.84 --> 5034.679
maybe but uh yeah I mean I'm trying to

5032.56 --> 5039.360000000001
figure it out

5034.679 --> 5042.4400000000005
and maybe I don't want them and their

5039.36 --> 5044.5199999999995
supposed expert knowledge to like I

5042.44 --> 5047.919999999999
maybe I just don't want to just copy

5044.52 --> 5050.400000000001
that maybe I want to understand it from

5047.92 --> 5050.4
my own

5053.199 --> 5058.638999999999
perspective

5054.84 --> 5060.88
yeah but I don't I don't really get

5058.639 --> 5063.6
angry with people just because they

5060.88 --> 5065.719
disagree I get angry with people because

5063.6 --> 5069.159000000001
of how they

5065.719 --> 5069.159
act when they

5071.96 --> 5079.36
disagree like they try to get in my way

5077.56 --> 5082.400000000001
like my

5079.36 --> 5084.119
considerations are like a danger to what

5082.4 --> 5087.44
they know to be a

5084.119 --> 5090.44
fact like that part that part pisses me

5087.44 --> 5090.44
off

5118.159 --> 5124.44
all right I mean that guy

5120.159 --> 5126.599999999999
yesterday kind of a sock troll figure

5124.44 --> 5128.96
and he was just like having this

5126.6 --> 5131.8
position about light waves and radio

5128.96 --> 5134.119
waves and all that and that's cool

5131.8 --> 5137.8
because it it got things rolling but

5134.119 --> 5139.5199999999995
then like when I round out suddenly as

5137.8 --> 5142.4800000000005
I'm rounding out they have to make a

5139.52 --> 5147.1990000000005
little comment like no you were just

5142.48 --> 5147.199
wrong yeah that pisses me

5148.199 --> 5151.96
off that that's the thing that's going

5150.56 --> 5155.1990000000005
to get you

5151.96 --> 5157.08
banned it's not about that you

5155.199 --> 5161.44
don't agree with me in the end it's

5157.08 --> 5165.0
about that you have to try to like

5161.44 --> 5168.839999999999
advertise that to everybody in some way

5165.0 --> 5173.32
to obstruct

5168.84 --> 5175.56
me to get in my way on purpose cuz

5173.32 --> 5177.88
suddenly you disapprove of everything

5175.56 --> 5180.76
that I do yeah that's the thing that

5177.88 --> 5180.76
gets me pissed

5183.239 --> 5186.239
off

5213.239 --> 5217.159
for for

5246.28 --> 5249.92
Dam it video keeps freezing

5253.96 --> 5258.56
up all right anyone watching don't

5256.88 --> 5262.159000000001
forget to rogans it

5258.56 --> 5262.159000000001
up share the

5267.88 --> 5273.119
show then hey I'd love to talk about

5270.44 --> 5275.32
Flat Earth but maybe I just need to if

5273.119 --> 5277.799999999999
maybe if I want the audience back I just

5275.32 --> 5280.239
have to review anti flat earther

5277.8 --> 5282.679
[ __ ]

5280.239 --> 5284.799999999999
debates cuz apparently that's the only

5282.679 --> 5288.719
thing that flat earthers care anymore

5284.8 --> 5291.4800000000005
about about their Nemesis anti flat

5288.719 --> 5293.56
earthers trying to talk their [ __ ]

5291.48 --> 5295.879999999999
and their trickery and then a flat

5293.56 --> 5298.719
earther has to point it

5295.88 --> 5303.2390000000005
out and that's the only thing that gets

5298.719 --> 5303.2390000000005
them going anymore apparently

5304.52 --> 5307.8
and yeah I don't do

5324.199 --> 5331.839999999999
that and I wonder maybe I

5328.28 --> 5333.04
should H okay Nathan's apparently not

5331.84 --> 5336.04
having a live

5333.04 --> 5336.04
show

5363.04 --> 5367.08
for for

5401.96 --> 5404.96
that

5431.04 --> 5437.76
do me a Nathan still talk

5435.32 --> 5443.44
really we

5437.76 --> 5443.4400000000005
talked did we Timeless when did that

5452.92 --> 5456.96
happen for

5487.239 --> 5492.5199999999995
or did you just assume well people seem

5489.76 --> 5495.119000000001
to assume a lot of

5492.52 --> 5497.360000000001
things about people when they're in a

5495.119 --> 5499.159
group and they just assume like oh yeah

5497.36 --> 5503.159
they're just going to do everything that

5499.159 --> 5503.159
I would do if I was part of a a

5503.6 --> 5510.280000000001
group yeah well guess

5507.32 --> 5514.679
what can you ask a question yeah sure

5510.28 --> 5514.679
you can ask a question why not

5536.159 --> 5543.48
why does he play video games during his

5539.48 --> 5543.48
stream uh

5545.88 --> 5550.719
well originally supposedly does did it

5548.719 --> 5553.4800000000005
to test his

5550.719 --> 5555.88
computer but I'm sure he's also doing it

5553.48 --> 5559.0
for the amusement

5555.88 --> 5561.150000000001
factor that there's people that like

5559.0 --> 5564.18
watching that kind of

5561.15 --> 5564.179999999999
[Music]

5567.44 --> 5571.08
thing so there you

5572.239 --> 5577.239
go seems disrespectful what do you

5587.639 --> 5592.119
mean how does it

5589.92 --> 5594.28
disrespectful he's not even listening to

5592.119 --> 5598.04
the show yeah no

5594.28 --> 5600.96
but yeah

5598.04 --> 5603.159
so I mean he has other people that do

5600.96 --> 5605.36
the talking and then he just plays the

5603.159 --> 5608.28
game and I mean I mean yeah I mean I

5605.36 --> 5608.28
don't see how that's

5614.48 --> 5619.04
disrespectful but Steve wind I don't

5616.88 --> 5622.96
know man it seems like a lot of people

5619.04 --> 5625.32
are just absolutely okay with that right

5622.96 --> 5626.28
you say it's disrespectful but Nathan

5625.32 --> 5630.08
gets

5626.28 --> 5633.4
like like hundreds of

5630.08 --> 5635.119
pounds like on a monthly basis through

5633.4 --> 5637.119
support through the patreon and

5635.119 --> 5639.239
everything so it seems like everybody's

5637.119 --> 5643.719
just perfectly fine with

5639.239 --> 5648.678999999999
it yeah in the meantime this guy over

5643.719 --> 5653.04
here I mely barely make like 50 bucks a

5648.679 --> 5653.04
month through this

5655.0 --> 5660.76
yeah got the full attention yeah I'm not

5658.4 --> 5663.04
gaming in the background I don't have a

5660.76 --> 5665.639
bunch of other people blabbering on

5663.04 --> 5669.4
while I don't get

5665.639 --> 5672.56
involved no I'm actually on

5669.4 --> 5675.159
screen the entire time trying to make

5672.56 --> 5677.080000000001
the show but it seems like people are

5675.159 --> 5679.879999999999
just really sick of me or they just

5677.08 --> 5683.08
don't they don't want to be hurt by me

5679.88 --> 5685.08
and my feelings anymore or something I

5683.08 --> 5688.5599999999995
don't know what the hell it

5685.08 --> 5688.5599999999995
is but

5689.199 --> 5694.599999999999
uh yeah people just really really like

5692.639 --> 5696.96
me until suddenly they don't like me

5694.6 --> 5700.56
anymore and then they really hate

5696.96 --> 5703.92
me I'm wondering if just like what's

5700.56 --> 5706.360000000001
going on is it just a bunch of women

5703.92 --> 5709.88
that find me attractive and gay guys are

5706.36 --> 5715.0
they the only ones that can handle

5709.88 --> 5717.08
me am I that repulsive in general it's

5715.0 --> 5720.199
like if you don't find me attractive I'm

5717.08 --> 5722.679
like really repulsive to you is that

5720.199 --> 5725.638999999999
what's going on is that why like I don't

5722.679 --> 5725.639
get support

5725.84 --> 5729.6
my people just suddenly turn on

5739.28 --> 5743.92
me I don't know man

5755.639 --> 5760.639
but I don't know yeah maybe I just need

5757.76 --> 5763.6
to hang around with more

5760.639 --> 5767.28
people I am going to have the show if

5763.6 --> 5770.719
everything goes Accord in accordance to

5767.28 --> 5773.639
plan if everything goes according to

5770.719 --> 5776.84
plan this Wednesday with grow have no

5773.639 --> 5780.04
idea what we're going to talk about

5776.84 --> 5782.32
though I have no idea what he thinks of

5780.04 --> 5784.96
me if he has any kind of thing that he

5782.32 --> 5788.04
wants to talk about

5784.96 --> 5791.719
maybe I mean he's like Pro is like a

5788.04 --> 5794.56
really good guy who's very caring so

5791.719 --> 5796.56
maybe he feels like all fatherly towards

5794.56 --> 5798.88
me maybe he has some advice on like how

5796.56 --> 5802.4800000000005
I could improve my life because it seems

5798.88 --> 5804.4800000000005
like things aren't going all that well I

5802.48 --> 5807.5599999999995
wouldn't be surprised if he did even

5804.48 --> 5810.959999999999
though he probably wouldn't do

5807.56 --> 5814.320000000001
that maybe he does have some

5810.96 --> 5817.04
tips maybe I I do just need to move on

5814.32 --> 5817.04
from doing

5827.94 --> 5834.08
[Music]

5829.199 --> 5834.08
this I mean I'm not getting monetized

5834.96 --> 5840.2390000000005
anymore people are barely supporting me

5838.32 --> 5843.96
so I don't really know why the hell I

5840.239 --> 5843.959999999999
even do this anymore

5844.6 --> 5848.719
am I going to get Patricia on the show

5854.0 --> 5858.84
maybe right but it's not like I'm

5856.679 --> 5860.96
exactly the light of the party right now

5858.84 --> 5864.92
so I don't know if she'd even like want

5860.96 --> 5864.92
to be on with me

5882.28 --> 5886.84
Mark did my show yeah well that kind of

5885.36 --> 5889.239
surprised

5886.84 --> 5892.28
me that he did

5889.239 --> 5896.799999999999
that on the

5892.28 --> 5899.119
yeah sure she would yeah good point she

5896.8 --> 5901.119000000001
probably would I don't know maybe I just

5899.119 --> 5904.119
don't feel worthy enough or something

5901.119 --> 5904.119
like

5916.39 --> 5931.84
[Music]

5930.36 --> 5934.04
but yeah

5931.84 --> 5937.360000000001
I'll I'll cont

5934.04 --> 5941.0
detor somewhere about it but I don't

5937.36 --> 5944.719
want to like send out a a contact like

5941.0 --> 5944.719
when I feel shitty

6017.159 --> 6023.239
all right anyhow I'm just going to try

6019.8 --> 6023.2390000000005
to move on

6025.96 --> 6031.76
right I mean at least I actually do a

6029.04 --> 6031.76
show every

6033.239 --> 6037.5199999999995
day even when I don't feel

6038.88 --> 6044.08
great although sometimes I'm really

6041.32 --> 6044.08
sorry that I

6046.52 --> 6053.76
do I mean yesterday it that this is kind

6050.719 --> 6056.639
of the issue like yesterday pretty

6053.76 --> 6058.400000000001
decent show like it did work

6056.639 --> 6061.28
out

6058.4 --> 6063.638999999999
but just the way it ended up it felt

6061.28 --> 6063.639
like

6063.88 --> 6067.32
terrible like I

6067.639 --> 6070.88
felt just

6074.96 --> 6080.84
terrible and then I'm like

6077.56 --> 6083.56
busying like the entire evening just to

6080.84 --> 6086.0
try to get over the feeling of just

6083.56 --> 6087.92
feeling incredibly miserable and lonely

6086.0 --> 6091.36
and

6087.92 --> 6094.0
failed cuz that's a lot of the time what

6091.36 --> 6094.0
it feels

6094.639 --> 6099.92
like I'm like trying to carry on here

6097.679 --> 6102.52
bravely and trying to keep figuring it

6099.92 --> 6106.56
out and just keep going and going and

6102.52 --> 6106.56
going but I mean feelings are

6107.0 --> 6111.4
not not very

6109.639 --> 6114.84
great with

6111.4 --> 6117.799999999999
me a lot of the time

6114.84 --> 6120.08
now right but at least I'm not in a

6117.8 --> 6122.400000000001
state where I'm [ __ ] hallucinating

6120.08 --> 6126.199
because of the

6122.4 --> 6128.5199999999995
pressures of unpleasant conditions that

6126.199 --> 6130.159
I'm still holding on to because it feels

6128.52 --> 6132.159000000001
like I'm part of building something

6130.159 --> 6135.5199999999995
bigger even though I don't actually get

6132.159 --> 6138.36
anything out of it yeah at least that's

6135.52 --> 6141.719
not there anymore I mean if you compare

6138.36 --> 6145.32
what I feel like right now compared to

6141.719 --> 6148.639
like a year ago I'm doing much

6145.32 --> 6151.44
better I just feel kind of lonely and

6148.639 --> 6151.4400000000005
Abandoned and

6151.48 --> 6158.08
[ __ ] and yeah that is pointless like I

6156.199 --> 6160.32
probably shouldn't even be saying that

6158.08 --> 6160.32
to

6166.639 --> 6173.719
anybody but it's also I mean it really

6171.04 --> 6176.08
is this freaking

6173.719 --> 6176.08
group

6176.239 --> 6186.32
man like when I moved out of

6179.52 --> 6186.320000000001
there they all just stopped talking to

6187.119 --> 6192.36
me

6188.719 --> 6195.199
like it's like these people are not

6192.36 --> 6197.48
actually into personal

6195.199 --> 6199.5599999999995
friendships like they don't have them

6197.48 --> 6203.4
it's just a

6199.56 --> 6205.599
gang it's like you're the FED crowd out

6203.4 --> 6207.96
there and if you're part of that then

6205.599 --> 6210.1990000000005
everybody talks to you and everybody's

6207.96 --> 6213.44
supposedly friends you don't want to be

6210.199 --> 6216.598999999999
part of it anymore then it's like they

6213.44 --> 6219.919999999999
just don't care

6216.599 --> 6223.400000000001
anymore they don't contact

6219.92 --> 6225.76
me nothing don't show up in my chat not

6223.4 --> 6229.159
that they showed up in my chat even

6225.76 --> 6232.08
while I was part of FD yeah that one of

6229.159 --> 6235.04
my complaints like hey nobody seems to

6232.08 --> 6235.04
give a [ __ ]

6235.199 --> 6240.5199999999995
it was kind of getting

6237.56 --> 6243.56
weird in the last few years even getting

6240.52 --> 6245.96
Praises from Nathan when he did because

6243.56 --> 6249.599
it's like oh this and that and like oh

6245.96 --> 6252.159
he's he's making the right arguments

6249.599 --> 6257.08
or pointing things

6252.159 --> 6260.0
out but nobody showed up in my chat just

6257.08 --> 6262.159
nobody they were all there right when

6260.0 --> 6264.0
fed started they're all there nobody

6262.159 --> 6266.679
shows up in my

6264.0 --> 6268.84
chat and now you can argue like oh but

6266.679 --> 6271.52
you were cranky sometimes and we just

6268.84 --> 6273.32
went off against people and

6271.52 --> 6276.76
apparently that

6273.32 --> 6279.159
is maybe part of the reason why that's

6276.76 --> 6281.8
happening because I can sometimes just

6279.159 --> 6281.799999999999
emotionally

6290.32 --> 6298.199
overreact didn't refracted curvature

6293.239 --> 6298.199
just leave what I did

6302.199 --> 6305.839999999999
he I have no

6308.52 --> 6316.4400000000005
idea where did he leave too he left okay

6313.92 --> 6319.88
would be kind of cool if he join up with

6316.44 --> 6323.04
me sometimes like that guy I had like my

6319.88 --> 6325.36
best discussions with him with phit

6323.04 --> 6325.36
about

6346.239 --> 6352.4
physics all new people well it's not a

6349.4 --> 6356.199
really old new people I mean 10th Man

6352.4 --> 6358.5199999999995
supposedly is back and Brian and Adam

6356.199 --> 6361.678999999999
are still hanging around I don't see

6358.52 --> 6361.679
them leaving anytime

6362.52 --> 6367.119000000001
soon except me

6384.0 --> 6390.04
I was a I tried to be borders boy but

6387.44 --> 6393.759999999999
the way that I conducted myself was just

6390.04 --> 6393.76
not convenient to

6399.28 --> 6407.5199999999995
them hey blue pill Evolution good to see

6402.679 --> 6411.84
youed got a job that conflict oh okay

6407.52 --> 6415.159000000001
that's that's different than than he

6411.84 --> 6415.159000000001
left Steve

6418.119 --> 6424.119
Winder right it's not like that's the

6420.32 --> 6424.119
first time that's happened

6469.32 --> 6472.799999999999
all right anyway I hope everybody's

6470.639 --> 6475.400000000001
enjoying the show please don't forget to

6472.8 --> 6478.28
ran it up and share

6475.4 --> 6480.159
it the show that is actually live and

6478.28 --> 6483.5199999999995
not just a

6480.159 --> 6485.799999999999
Premiere because I actually do go live

6483.52 --> 6485.8
every

6488.239 --> 6494.959999999999
day unless I'm like overslept is so

6492.84 --> 6499.679
badly that it's just like okay I'm not

6494.96 --> 6499.679
doing a show but I mean that's very

6501.76 --> 6504.76
rare

6531.719 --> 6534.719
for

6561.719 --> 6565.679
for for

6600.679 --> 6603.679
that

6638.8 --> 6642.119000000001
I don't know what's going on but

6640.719 --> 6644.52
something

6642.119 --> 6648.5599999999995
shifted I feel a lot

6644.52 --> 6651.2390000000005
better we here hey clutch see

6648.56 --> 6653.679
you maybe it's just wrenches suddenly

6651.239 --> 6656.839999999999
showing up

6653.679 --> 6659.84
I mean I know it it shouldn't really

6656.84 --> 6659.84
matter all that

6660.84 --> 6664.56
much but

6665.92 --> 6672.119
yeah I mean I still used to remember

6669.04 --> 6675.119
when asking for people to actually show

6672.119 --> 6676.799999999999
up during the live show was just like

6675.119 --> 6678.88
that was normal and people would then

6676.8 --> 6683.320000000001
say like yeah I'm really trying to be

6678.88 --> 6683.32
there and now it's like

6684.079 --> 6689.119
it seems like people yeah people that I

6687.4 --> 6690.879999999999
consider to be my friends they don't

6689.119 --> 6692.96
really it doesn't really seem to matter

6690.88 --> 6694.92
anymore whether you can be there during

6692.96 --> 6697.679
the live show or not for some reason

6694.92 --> 6697.679
it's like that's

6697.84 --> 6704.8
changed I don't want to be whiny and

6701.4 --> 6707.32
complainy about it but I mean the show

6704.8 --> 6711.159000000001
has always been way

6707.32 --> 6713.96
better when wrenches have actually been

6711.159 --> 6717.36
there it's not just because you can have

6713.96 --> 6719.76
moderator functions or I trust you

6717.36 --> 6723.239
enough to have a wrench it's also

6719.76 --> 6726.119000000001
because all of you are like more studied

6723.239 --> 6729.959999999999
into my way of thinking

6726.119 --> 6732.679
like when I Dole out ideas or or

6729.96 --> 6734.8
considerations or reconsiderations you

6732.679 --> 6736.32
guys get it

6734.8 --> 6741.320000000001
better

6736.32 --> 6745.239
so I get responses that are more

6741.32 --> 6745.239
effective when you guys are

6748.04 --> 6751.199
around all

6752.44 --> 6759.04
right but I mean I understand that

6755.679 --> 6763.119
whatever man priorities and

6759.04 --> 6765.5199999999995
jobs all that stuff that you just can't

6763.119 --> 6768.96
be here all the

6765.52 --> 6770.2390000000005
time like I am here all the time right

6768.96 --> 6774.92
cuz I

6770.239 --> 6774.919999999999
am I'm always here always there in the

6780.159 --> 6785.239
show but sometimes I get cranky

6813.43 --> 6816.4890000000005
[Music]

6825.199 --> 6829.199
yeah BL no it don't worry about it

6830.119 --> 6834.44
lill I appreciate the times you're

6839.4 --> 6846.159
there but I mean it it does make it

6842.639 --> 6850.159000000001
tougher for me to just continue on doing

6846.159 --> 6853.92
this not because of you specifically in

6850.159 --> 6856.079
general it's like it would be way more

6853.92 --> 6860.32
convenient for everybody that I know and

6856.079 --> 6860.32
trust to have just a night owl

6860.88 --> 6865.8
show but it's no way that I would be

6863.4 --> 6867.839999999999
able to do that every day there's just

6865.8 --> 6872.4400000000005
no

6867.84 --> 6874.719
way and I like I would miss it I like I

6872.44 --> 6877.0
would really start to like get like

6874.719 --> 6878.719
Jitters from not doing the early bir

6877.0 --> 6881.76
show I know I

6878.719 --> 6886.0
will like I already get that when I like

6881.76 --> 6887.88
skip a show it's kind of weird seriously

6886.0 --> 6889.76
that happens it's like if I don't do an

6887.88 --> 6892.4400000000005
early bird show like unless I'm

6889.76 --> 6895.119000000001
physically sick or something

6892.44 --> 6898.28
because I like didn't eat well or slept

6895.119 --> 6901.679
really terribly like

6898.28 --> 6903.44
unless I'm like physically ill like if I

6901.679 --> 6906.639
don't do the early bird show it's like

6903.44 --> 6910.4
almost like I take a hit and meth I just

6906.639 --> 6914.079
get all that energy that just just makes

6910.4 --> 6917.36
me Super Hyper it just

6914.079 --> 6917.36
happens it's

6918.04 --> 6925.04
weird and so

6920.639 --> 6928.4800000000005
yeah beside moving the

6925.04 --> 6931.4
show to yeah night hour time

6928.48 --> 6934.879999999999
slot I'd still have to like figure out

6931.4 --> 6937.879999999999
what to do with the

6934.88 --> 6940.599
daytime to do something that is

6937.88 --> 6942.92
effective that'll keep me

6940.599 --> 6945.8
sharp

6942.92 --> 6948.96
because if I just like if it wouldn't

6945.8 --> 6951.159000000001
matter then I would also have certain

6948.96 --> 6953.2390000000005
days where I'd get the tendency to

6951.159 --> 6957.04
basically like

6953.239 --> 6959.44
just start smoking like lots of joints

6957.04 --> 6961.96
early which is like a terrible

6959.44 --> 6965.598999999999
influence usually a sign of depression

6961.96 --> 6968.199
when that happens it's just that me

6965.599 --> 6971.8
doing this show every day around this

6968.199 --> 6978.199
time has been like a stability factor

6971.8 --> 6981.8
for me that actually despite its varying

6978.199 --> 6985.638999999999
success overall like the stabilizing

6981.8 --> 6985.639
influence is very important to

6988.199 --> 6996.28
me let shows more effort in the on you

6991.88 --> 6998.679
do that would be a seemingly good idea

6996.28 --> 6998.679
Richard

7002.239 --> 7008.678999999999
G sometimes I do wish like yeah what if

7005.52 --> 7011.320000000001
I just like was like two days not

7008.679 --> 7014.4400000000005
streaming and then use that time to like

7011.32 --> 7014.44
edit videos or

7015.04 --> 7020.48
something but

7017.28 --> 7024.92
then yeah that's the whole thing if I

7020.48 --> 7027.4
like skip the show it's like almost my

7024.92 --> 7029.88
internal world just

7027.4 --> 7033.04
like takes

7029.88 --> 7035.04
Revenge it's like oh and then I'm going

7033.04 --> 7038.119
to get really awesome

7035.04 --> 7040.84
ideas it's so typical

7038.119 --> 7042.96
right I do the shows all the time I

7040.84 --> 7045.599
might get depleted

7042.96 --> 7048.76
after a while if I then just stop doing

7045.599 --> 7050.84
it or don't show up for one time it's

7048.76 --> 7053.400000000001
like the inspiration just comes back

7050.84 --> 7057.32
with the Vengeance almost because I

7053.4 --> 7057.32
don't because I canceled the

7057.36 --> 7062.159
show it's a mechanism inside of

7067.44 --> 7073.919999999999
me deciding

7069.8 --> 7077.92
topics yeah sure Rich G I mean

7073.92 --> 7081.079
yes to a degree that's

7077.92 --> 7085.32
doable but I mean I am kind of just

7081.079 --> 7085.32
deciding topics topics as I

7087.32 --> 7093.36
go aren't I I mean I start out the show

7091.0 --> 7095.44
with the show number and then there

7093.36 --> 7099.639
isn't a title and

7095.44 --> 7101.839999999999
then at some point then it's like it

7099.639 --> 7107.84
feels like I figured out what the show

7101.84 --> 7107.84
is actually about and then the title is

7111.04 --> 7118.28
manifested you can scan the internet for

7114.119 --> 7118.28
top but I already do that BL

7128.96 --> 7134.4800000000005
Evolution you like it that there's a

7131.0 --> 7134.48
show every day yeah I'm

7136.56 --> 7143.0
sure would be great though if

7140.119 --> 7146.5199999999995
you express

7143.0 --> 7149.84
that that liking with maybe some

7146.52 --> 7154.599
financial support

7149.84 --> 7157.88
yeah like I I I wish to go on every day

7154.599 --> 7161.2390000000005
I I do it it is a financial Factor

7157.88 --> 7163.8
though that is making it it feels like

7161.239 --> 7166.598999999999
it's forcing me

7163.8 --> 7169.719
to do something else because it's like

7166.599 --> 7172.8
this is not

7169.719 --> 7175.2390000000005
sustainable it's not sustainable to me

7172.8 --> 7178.719
financially like that that is it like

7175.239 --> 7180.5599999999995
yeah my mentally I might go up and down

7178.719 --> 7183.28
and all that but that's all part of what

7180.56 --> 7186.119000000001
I do anyway right sometimes I got cranky

7183.28 --> 7189.44
days and then I'll like start ramming on

7186.119 --> 7191.04
trolls and then other days I'm like

7189.44 --> 7194.678999999999
super

7191.04 --> 7196.599
inspired especially like in response

7194.679 --> 7199.679
like I got bad days and then I have

7196.599 --> 7203.1990000000005
extra good days in response right

7199.679 --> 7205.079
crankiness lots of energy release

7203.199 --> 7207.719
then

7205.079 --> 7211.199
silence and a lot of room and Clarity I

7207.719 --> 7214.159
mean that's just the fluctuations of my

7211.199 --> 7214.159
functioning of this

7214.48 --> 7219.959999999999
show it's part of the Waves man

7224.599 --> 7228.76
you would give me if you could

7229.76 --> 7236.280000000001
okay I well thanks I

7242.28 --> 7248.92
guess although I would be a lot more

7245.44 --> 7253.799999999999
happy if you'd actually do it though I

7248.92 --> 7255.4800000000005
mean there never you can never do that

7253.8 --> 7257.639
I mean I'm not going to like kick you

7255.48 --> 7260.5599999999995
out or something just because you refus

7257.639 --> 7260.56
to support me

7265.199 --> 7272.799999999999
but I mean like what's going on man like

7268.84 --> 7275.159000000001
is everything financially so incredibly

7272.8 --> 7278.04
literally depleted that just people like

7275.159 --> 7283.638999999999
suddenly just don't support

7278.04 --> 7283.639
anymore like is it that bad

7284.88 --> 7288.28
Kitty Hello

7309.159 --> 7313.759999999999
Kitty some white kitty

7321.599 --> 7324.84
meow hey

7326.49 --> 7329.96
[Music]

7332.679 --> 7338.28
Kitty see that's what I have to deal

7335.04 --> 7338.28
with here

7358.0 --> 7362.199
yeah this cat I mean I love this cat

7359.88 --> 7362.1990000000005
he's

7363.28 --> 7368.5199999999995
great he always keeps rolling around

7379.639 --> 7384.1990000000005
yeah but with this heat I he is like a

7382.119 --> 7387.199
giant fur ball

7384.199 --> 7389.719
though like every time I do actually pet

7387.199 --> 7392.719
him then I have to like get rid of the

7389.719 --> 7392.719
hair

7428.639 --> 7433.559
do appreciate the little Community you

7430.559 --> 7433.559
created

7434.0 --> 7439.76
yeah and that's why thank thanks clutch

7437.119 --> 7442.36
I mean I I appreciate that I know it's

7439.76 --> 7445.360000000001
tough out there in

7442.36 --> 7445.36
general

7446.719 --> 7449.719
it's

7452.76 --> 7458.679
yeah I guess it's just an overall

7455.559 --> 7461.04
scenario of like I'm basically like the

7458.679 --> 7464.04
street performer except on the internet

7461.04 --> 7468.679
in a way right right I've already made

7464.04 --> 7470.04
that that analogy about my activity here

7468.679 --> 7472.28
it's like yeah I'm just a street

7470.04 --> 7475.239
performer it's just like oh could you

7472.28 --> 7478.079
support me please but yeah when

7475.239 --> 7482.919999999999
everybody's doing bad because the

7478.079 --> 7485.199
economy is just terrible we're being be

7482.92 --> 7487.1990000000005
besieged by our governments and the

7485.199 --> 7489.598999999999
elite and mega

7487.199 --> 7493.04
corporations and their cons and their

7489.599 --> 7495.96
conspiracy against us well the street

7493.04 --> 7497.119
performer and The Bard they all get to

7495.96 --> 7502.159
suffer the

7497.119 --> 7505.92
most because when the world

7502.159 --> 7508.159
flourishes we get the best times like

7505.92 --> 7511.599
because everybody's like doing well and

7508.159 --> 7513.32
they're like yeah we canot just support

7511.599 --> 7515.0
people and make them more happy and that

7513.32 --> 7516.759999999999
makes us more happy and then they do

7515.0 --> 7518.36
better and then we do better and then it

7516.76 --> 7520.719
all just everybody

7518.36 --> 7522.159
crushes and like everything goes well

7520.719 --> 7524.84
and it's like whoa look at all the

7522.159 --> 7527.5199999999995
support coming in it's amazing right and

7524.84 --> 7529.76
then then I get more inspired and

7527.52 --> 7533.88
everybody's just better but then when

7529.76 --> 7537.320000000001
things go sour and and money dries up

7533.88 --> 7537.32
it's like the worst

7538.679 --> 7546.52
man like now it just kind of feels

7542.8 --> 7549.320000000001
like instead of like this developing

7546.52 --> 7552.88
economy booming

7549.32 --> 7554.44
economy situation where it's like doable

7552.88 --> 7557.079
now it just feels like suddenly

7554.44 --> 7559.96
everything's turned into a

7557.079 --> 7562.92
desert and I'm like yeah well at least I

7559.96 --> 7566.8
got like some loyalist friends who are

7562.92 --> 7568.92
basically crazy enough to still hang

7566.8 --> 7571.92
around I'm just saying it like that I

7568.92 --> 7574.119
don't literally mean that it's crazy

7571.92 --> 7576.04
enough to hang around while I just like

7574.119 --> 7580.239
there's just a desert and everybody's

7576.04 --> 7584.159
just like like oh wow a drop of water

7580.239 --> 7584.159
amazing but we will be

7585.679 --> 7592.559
there right we can't we can't help you

7588.679 --> 7595.52
out though but we'll be there with you

7592.559 --> 7598.639
and I mean that is really the sign of

7595.52 --> 7601.52
friendship though and I do really

7598.639 --> 7604.84
appreciate it but sometimes I just get

7601.52 --> 7607.400000000001
universally desperate with also like the

7604.84 --> 7609.96
besieging of governments and everything

7607.4 --> 7613.119
just making me cranky like

7609.96 --> 7615.8
appealing or Trigg ing my defensive

7613.119 --> 7619.04
instincts where it's just like I I want

7615.8 --> 7624.159000000001
to get aggressive to

7619.04 --> 7624.159
defend my community to defend the

7624.76 --> 7633.119000000001
people but they're all [ __ ] insane

7629.239 --> 7635.638999999999
though they're insane they they don't

7633.119 --> 7638.759999999999
know what to

7635.639 --> 7642.04
do they don't even want to recognize how

7638.76 --> 7645.4800000000005
bad it really is a lot of the time

7642.04 --> 7648.119
and so it just like it's just all my

7645.48 --> 7652.0
instincts are just getting cornered

7648.119 --> 7654.679
and it just sometimes then just breaks

7652.0 --> 7656.84
apart it diffuses into the just this

7654.679 --> 7661.8
desperate attitude that

7656.84 --> 7665.0
then like gets it just

7661.8 --> 7666.76
ignites and I just get like Vengeance I

7665.0 --> 7669.559
just want

7666.76 --> 7671.559
Vengeance Vengeance on this world like

7669.559 --> 7672.96
maybe if I commit some kind of

7671.559 --> 7676.079000000001
horrendous

7672.96 --> 7679.119
act that people will just snap out of

7676.079 --> 7679.119
what out of this

7680.44 --> 7685.36
trans that that literally becomes like

7683.8 --> 7688.52
the

7685.36 --> 7690.88
motivator it's like maybe if I just did

7688.52 --> 7694.159000000001
like committed some kind of horrendous

7690.88 --> 7697.0
atrocity then maybe people would just

7694.159 --> 7697.0
snap out of

7698.079 --> 7704.599
it and that's a terrible aonic temp temp

7702.079 --> 7708.88
I mean it is a terrible terrible

7704.599 --> 7708.88
Temptation and it is born from

7715.079 --> 7720.48
desperation all those dollars have

7717.159 --> 7723.199
brought come back because of the Fall

7720.48 --> 7725.678999999999
yeah not the way to go I know I know

7723.199 --> 7729.719
it's not the way to go clutch thanks for

7725.679 --> 7729.719
saying now I but

7732.119 --> 7738.839999999999
I I just try to explain

7734.8 --> 7742.88
like I experience

7738.84 --> 7745.599
pressures like spiritual based social

7742.88 --> 7748.32
Community Based pressures and instincts

7745.599 --> 7751.719
that are just so frustrated a lot of the

7748.32 --> 7754.639
time it's because I'm an empath too like

7751.719 --> 7757.079
I feel the feelings that are out there

7754.639 --> 7760.28
and even though the people might not act

7757.079 --> 7763.84
upon those feelings I still get to feel

7760.28 --> 7766.32
it all it's like I get to feel the

7763.84 --> 7768.639
overall state of what is going around

7766.32 --> 7772.599
even if the people themselves that are

7768.639 --> 7775.0
feeling it are not responding to it and

7772.599 --> 7778.079
that just drives me insane it it makes

7775.0 --> 7781.239
me feel like I'm a lightning rod I'm a

7778.079 --> 7784.36
lightening Rod of feelings like I feel

7781.239 --> 7787.879999999999
things because other people

7784.36 --> 7790.598999999999
don't respond don't act those feelings

7787.88 --> 7793.36
they they don't discharge the feeling so

7790.599 --> 7794.96
it just hang around like attention and

7793.36 --> 7797.88
I'm

7794.96 --> 7798.51
like I'm getting lightning rotted from

7797.88 --> 7800.159000000001
all of

7798.51 --> 7803.159000000001
[Music]

7800.159 --> 7806.239
it and I guess I am like that I am like

7803.159 --> 7810.32
the lightning rod I'm always just acting

7806.239 --> 7813.759999999999
out the feelings of what is out there in

7810.32 --> 7815.199
people that they don't or they dare not

7813.76 --> 7818.360000000001
act

7815.199 --> 7820.919999999999
upon cuz they

7818.36 --> 7822.32
destabilize but they they I bet that

7820.92 --> 7825.96
they do feel

7822.32 --> 7829.0
it a jimo con Aron

7825.96 --> 7831.84
yeah you know what that is by the way

7829.0 --> 7835.199
it's a Rudolph Steiner

7831.84 --> 7839.28
cosmology is it an aspect of

7835.199 --> 7844.44
Satan or yeah it's one or two Lucifer

7839.28 --> 7844.44
arimon seduction and death

7882.119 --> 7886.598999999999
right you could also like see it in in

7884.119 --> 7888.44
charges it's like araman Lucifer like

7886.599 --> 7891.4400000000005
Lucifer is like

7888.44 --> 7893.96
a an

7891.44 --> 7896.54
overcharger charges you too much it's

7893.96 --> 7898.32
like too attempting too alluring

7896.54 --> 7902.36
[Music]

7898.32 --> 7905.44
too seducing that that you're

7902.36 --> 7909.159
more or that you can do anything or that

7905.44 --> 7916.199
you can have your will be the

7909.159 --> 7916.199
ruler to be God right well aramon is

7917.4 --> 7925.32
discharging it's

7919.599 --> 7928.52
depletion it's vacancy it's robotic

7925.32 --> 7931.36
automation it's death I mean it is liter

7928.52 --> 7933.0
it's like charge discharge Lucifer

7931.36 --> 7935.839999999999
overcharges

7933.0 --> 7939.079
you it rips you out of a balance makes

7935.84 --> 7942.159000000001
you overcharge but it what

7939.079 --> 7944.88
overcharges eventually has to discharge

7942.159 --> 7946.638999999999
and that's where aramon come in so it's

7944.88 --> 7950.32
almost like you're

7946.639 --> 7950.32
stuck between an

7950.4 --> 7955.5199999999995
electric

7952.0 --> 7958.44
oscillation if you if you basically move

7955.52 --> 7960.8
away from the middle path that is Christ

7958.44 --> 7963.598999999999
and get seduced by Lucifer or get

7960.8 --> 7963.599
discouraged by

7963.679 --> 7969.76
aramon they're just like this electric

7966.599 --> 7973.559
charge discharge effect on the spirit

7969.76 --> 7976.159000000001
that that just rips you away from a

7973.559 --> 7979.2390000000005
balance and depletes you eventually and

7976.159 --> 7981.48
that's why yeah doesn't matter like how

7979.239 --> 7983.799999999999
well you deal with the charge that

7981.48 --> 7987.44
Lucifer brings you you always end up

7983.8 --> 7988.96
getting discharged through aramon this

7987.44 --> 7992.879999999999
is

7988.96 --> 7992.88
interesting it's interesting

7993.96 --> 8003.199
comparison butter is $10 Jesus lettuce

7999.679 --> 8007.159
five that is crazy clutch although that

8003.199 --> 8011.96
those are Canadian dollars right

8007.159 --> 8011.96
so I mean they were already pretty much

8012.28 --> 8017.199
worthless so it's not the regular

8015.52 --> 8020.280000000001
American

8017.199 --> 8023.119
dollars but uh yeah I mean butter here

8020.28 --> 8023.119
is

8023.559 --> 8031.88
like5 7 pounds

8027.199 --> 8033.799999999999
Jesus bsh boy that is that's nutty

8031.88 --> 8038.4800000000005
I mean I can get

8033.8 --> 8041.079000000001
like maximum quality organic butter here

8038.48 --> 8044.598999999999
for for like less

8041.079 --> 8047.159
than5 but maybe I'm speaking too soon

8044.599 --> 8049.599
maybe like in a month time the pric is

8047.159 --> 8052.32
catch on and suddenly it becomes €6 EUR

8049.599 --> 8055.119000000001
or something or even more who knows man

8052.32 --> 8056.5199999999995
pric is just they seem to just like stay

8055.119 --> 8059.92
at a certain level and then they

8056.52 --> 8062.52
suddenly jump up and it's always like

8059.92 --> 8064.84
one item out of everything it's not like

8062.52 --> 8068.079000000001
everything all jumps up it's

8064.84 --> 8070.599
like suddenly some product

8068.079 --> 8073.28
just gets more expensive that's how it

8070.599 --> 8075.28
seems to be regulated here in the

8073.28 --> 8079.5199999999995
Netherlands I don't know how that that

8075.28 --> 8081.84
is happening in England or Canada or the

8079.52 --> 8082.88
us but that's how I'm experiencing the

8081.84 --> 8085.599
the price

8082.88 --> 8088.400000000001
raising it it doesn't all just

8085.599 --> 8090.639
simultaneously go up like certain

8088.4 --> 8093.48
products just suddenly make a jump and

8090.639 --> 8096.4400000000005
then they stay at the higher Point

8093.48 --> 8096.44
that's how it's happening

8097.92 --> 8102.119
here but yeah it's it's

8102.8 --> 8110.1990000000005
nuts and the crazy I mean seriously the

8106.239 --> 8113.879999999999
craziest thing about it is

8110.199 --> 8115.5199999999995
that it's actually more expensive to eat

8113.88 --> 8121.079
non-organic

8115.52 --> 8121.079000000001
food compared to eating organic food

8121.28 --> 8126.119
yeah it used to be like there was kind

8123.159 --> 8127.598999999999
of a a bigger difference between organic

8126.119 --> 8129.4
and non-organic food and like

8127.599 --> 8131.76
non-organic food was really a lot

8129.4 --> 8133.36
cheaper it just didn't do anything for

8131.76 --> 8136.4400000000005
it it's not

8133.36 --> 8138.558999999999
healthy right compare compar I mean it's

8136.44 --> 8141.879999999999
not that bad but it's just not as good

8138.559 --> 8144.76
as organic now the amount that organic

8141.88 --> 8147.119
food seems to have risen in price

8144.76 --> 8149.4400000000005
compared to regular food how much it's

8147.119 --> 8152.92
risen in price it seems like organic is

8149.44 --> 8152.919999999999
just better off

8153.44 --> 8160.48
CU I think that like the price hikes of

8156.92 --> 8163.1990000000005
regular Foods really gone up more like

8160.48 --> 8165.159
it's become more expensive for regular

8163.199 --> 8167.96
food than organic food that's what I'm

8165.159 --> 8170.079
figuring out seems like the people that

8167.96 --> 8173.159
just go to the regular Supermarket

8170.079 --> 8176.199
they're hit the hardest by

8173.159 --> 8177.159
this for me yeah it's becoming like

8176.199 --> 8179.678999999999
[ __ ]

8177.159 --> 8182.199
expensive but I've already been like

8179.679 --> 8186.159
really for years years for years guys

8182.199 --> 8186.159
I've been like absolutely

8186.239 --> 8193.88
minimizing my meals and everything just

8188.96 --> 8196.359
really having the standard Food

8193.88 --> 8199.358999999999
Arrangements really

8196.359 --> 8202.359
minimum and yeah it's become more

8199.359 --> 8204.599
expensive but it was always kind of

8202.359 --> 8207.800000000001
expensive and it's

8204.599 --> 8210.28
like it's table it's

8207.8 --> 8211.92
doable but there's people out there like

8210.28 --> 8215.679
especially with bigger families and not

8211.92 --> 8215.679
a lot of income that are just like

8216.88 --> 8222.598999999998
[ __ ] it's like oh what you eat

8220.24 --> 8225.0
non-organic food at the regular

8222.599 --> 8228.679
Supermarket because it's

8225.0 --> 8230.12
cheaper well that was nice while it

8228.679 --> 8232.92
lasted

8230.12 --> 8236.439
right that doesn't seem to be apply

8232.92 --> 8236.439
applying anymore

8241.599 --> 8247.880000000001
shrink flation is real yeah I haven't

8245.12 --> 8247.880000000001
noticed that

8254.04 --> 8258.439
though thank God I mean but I mean

8256.479 --> 8260.84
organic food is already like kind of

8258.439 --> 8263.28
minimum

8260.84 --> 8266.0
portions I mean an

8263.28 --> 8268.319000000001
American buying at the organic grocery

8266.0 --> 8271.16
store here here would feel like they're

8268.319 --> 8273.039999999999
at a French restaurant or something

8271.16 --> 8276.08
where like all the portions are just

8273.04 --> 8276.080000000002
microscopic to

8277.479 --> 8283.24
them

8279.84 --> 8286.0
like a hamburger patty

8283.24 --> 8288.8
here that's like half a hamburger patty

8286.0 --> 8290.88
to an American like you get packages of

8288.8 --> 8293.719
like two of

8290.88 --> 8296.399
them and to me that's like perfect like

8293.719 --> 8298.24
it's a perfect dosage but to the average

8296.399 --> 8301.039999999999
American be like

8298.24 --> 8302.719
that's I mean like what do you Japanese

8301.04 --> 8305.479000000001
woman or something

8302.719 --> 8308.399
like how is that enough for you like

8305.479 --> 8311.319
yeah I'm an arwi I'm I'm kind

8308.399 --> 8314.08
of not that big I don't need that much

8311.319 --> 8318.199999999999
and as long as it's organic and made

8314.08 --> 8318.2
with love like it

8319.2 --> 8324.800000000001
works I just don't need that much I

8322.2 --> 8327.599
really really don't and it's been like

8324.8 --> 8329.679
that forever like I've had more health

8327.599 --> 8332.519
problems when I was just continually

8329.679 --> 8335.8
stuffing myself

8332.519 --> 8337.880000000001
like more long-term issues like really

8335.8 --> 8340.92
like actually painful

8337.88 --> 8344.399
problems like when I was stuffing myself

8340.92 --> 8347.8
more I had more back

8344.399 --> 8350.639
problems I arguably had more

8347.8 --> 8355.719
inflammation type problems even in my

8350.639 --> 8356.719
jaw and more headaches more flu things

8355.719 --> 8362.719
all

8356.719 --> 8362.719
that than I do now when I

8362.84 --> 8371.16
like eat just to get

8366.359 --> 8371.16
by just enough meals to like keep

8373.92 --> 8382.0
going like there's periods every day

8378.24 --> 8385.199999999999
where I experience a degree of

8382.0 --> 8387.84
hunger and not like really uncomfort but

8385.2 --> 8390.800000000001
just like I feel like I could eat

8387.84 --> 8392.84
something and then I don't like that

8390.8 --> 8397.319
happens every day it's been happening

8392.84 --> 8400.8
every day for like two years at least 3

8397.319 --> 8403.08
years before that yeah I was still going

8400.8 --> 8407.84
through stuff

8403.08 --> 8411.8
and what your internet went up in price

8407.84 --> 8411.8
okay that's weird borders

8412.16 --> 8421.6
boy take away Pizza yeah what wow that's

8418.319 --> 8424.72
crazy pizzas by the way pre fat pizzas

8421.6 --> 8426.479000000001
remember when I was enjoying those a lot

8424.72 --> 8427.679999999998
and I would almost eat a pizza every day

8426.479 --> 8429.279999999999
and then eventually I'd start

8427.68 --> 8431.56
complaining like how it was starting to

8429.28 --> 8436.52
feel unhealthy well when I was doing

8431.56 --> 8436.519999999999
that pizzas when I bought them they were

8436.88 --> 8442.319
like5 and then I had to buy the Sal the

8439.76 --> 8445.84
salami on top of that and some chili

8442.319 --> 8448.519999999999
pepper and would be a great

8445.84 --> 8451.56
pizza and it would be like five six

8448.52 --> 8455.68
bucks to do that

8451.56 --> 8460.84
they cost like8

8455.68 --> 8460.84
now and like the extra

8462.8 --> 8469.8
stuff it kind of costs like overall 10

8467.24 --> 8472.6
euros to do that

8469.8 --> 8474.759999999998
now just one p it basically almost

8472.6 --> 8477.439
doubled in

8474.76 --> 8480.319
price and I don't really take it anymore

8477.439 --> 8482.92
because well because when I do it I

8480.319 --> 8485.08
really get a pizza when I really want

8482.92 --> 8488.479
one it's like I want a pizza I don't

8485.08 --> 8491.28
care I want one of those and then I'm

8488.479 --> 8493.519999999999
like saturated for a while because I

8491.28 --> 8495.640000000001
don't I shouldn't be eating them on a

8493.52 --> 8497.68
regular basis it seems like it's not

8495.64 --> 8500.279999999999
that healthy for

8497.68 --> 8502.76
me it's just sometimes it's really

8500.28 --> 8506.2
enjoyable but it doesn't seem to be

8502.76 --> 8506.2
doing a lot of good for

8506.6 --> 8511.880000000001
me 10 means no pizza

8511.92 --> 8519.28
right yeah and that's not and I mean

8515.28 --> 8521.880000000001
that's not like ordering a pizza borders

8519.28 --> 8524.24
boy right that's not or that's like

8521.88 --> 8526.64
getting one from the supermarket and

8524.24 --> 8530.0
preparing it

8526.64 --> 8534.08
yourself like adding the toppings and

8530.0 --> 8536.64
everything so and that costs me

8534.08 --> 8541.359
€1 I mean I don't even want to know what

8536.64 --> 8543.439
it cost to like order a pizza organic

8541.359 --> 8545.960000000001
I mean a regular pizza if you order that

8543.439 --> 8548.2
it would probably cost more than 10 at

8545.96 --> 8552.279999999999
this point I don't know I don't even

8548.2 --> 8553.960000000001
check because well I never order

8552.28 --> 8559.479000000001
out

8553.96 --> 8563.08
like literally I've never ever ordered

8559.479 --> 8565.319
food and had it I had like my The Gamers

8563.08 --> 8567.439
they they would come over they would

8565.319 --> 8572.16
order out all the

8567.439 --> 8576.52
time but me I've never done that like

8572.16 --> 8580.6
ever not one time in my life have I

8576.52 --> 8580.6
ordered out food not one

8582.0 --> 8588.84
time that's how strict I've been with

8585.76 --> 8591.28
food since I started eating organic

8588.84 --> 8594.479
because yeah if there was like or

8591.28 --> 8597.6
takeout or an order thing that you could

8594.479 --> 8599.64
do online that's like guaranteed good

8597.6 --> 8601.359
quality oranic dude I would have done

8599.64 --> 8602.8
that

8601.359 --> 8606.24
there isn't

8602.8 --> 8606.24
any doesn't

8608.56 --> 8612.72
exist which has always been a surprise

8611.04 --> 8614.439
it's been such a surprise to me that

8612.72 --> 8617.88
I've even thought of

8614.439 --> 8620.399
like I should I maybe I want to like

8617.88 --> 8625.24
start a company that does

8620.399 --> 8627.519999999999
that an order take out food thing online

8625.24 --> 8633.359
that's like exclusively

8627.52 --> 8636.880000000001
organic but like at organic Supermarket

8633.359 --> 8640.12
prices and not like insanely expensive

8636.88 --> 8640.119999999999
because nobody wants to do

8651.72 --> 8659.64
that Supermarket stopped stocking up

8654.52 --> 8659.640000000001
empty Pizza laces wow

8664.64 --> 8669.96
wow so they just didn't wow that's a

8667.64 --> 8673.64
cheap shot borders boy I mean that's

8669.96 --> 8673.64
terrible Market

8676.56 --> 8681.88
marketing people buying the cheaper

8679.399 --> 8684.519999999999
things oh so then we're just not going

8681.88 --> 8686.839999999998
to provide the cheaper things you have

8684.52 --> 8689.319000000001
to buy the more expensive things I mean

8686.84 --> 8693.359
what this that's just

8689.319 --> 8693.359
scam for

8722.0 --> 8730.84
H all right blue

8725.56 --> 8733.319
pill well that's I mean that's a

8730.84 --> 8735.8
challenge buying a house you might want

8733.319 --> 8739.319
to like wait until like the housing

8735.8 --> 8741.679999999998
market collapses again I mean you got to

8739.319 --> 8744.56
realize

8741.68 --> 8746.279
like the dollar is like really about to

8744.56 --> 8748.199999999999
crash because of bricks and everything

8746.279 --> 8751.04
and it's just

8748.2 --> 8753.68
collapsing you you got a Time

8751.04 --> 8755.560000000001
right when you're going to buy a house

8753.68 --> 8758.0
you got to figure out exactly when to do

8755.56 --> 8760.0
it because you don't want to like when

8758.0 --> 8763.04
it's super unstable you

8760.0 --> 8765.2
can you can by accident just lose a lot

8763.04 --> 8765.2
of

8766.04 --> 8770.6
money like you buy it and suddenly it

8768.64 --> 8773.439
loses all its value and [ __ ] like you

8770.6 --> 8775.56
got to be careful with the timing just

8773.439 --> 8779.04
you know this do know this [ __ ] way

8775.56 --> 8779.039999999999
better than me

8780.359 --> 8786.279
dude if I'd be buying a house I'd be

8782.52 --> 8786.279
nervous as hell right

8805.96 --> 8810.759999999998
now hey Kitty what are you doing

8812.439 --> 8819.04
y of course yeah I bet you're going to

8815.359 --> 8819.04
throw all my stuff over

8822.92 --> 8826.04
[Music]

8830.04 --> 8835.2
there my God all the cat hairs

8841.84 --> 8843.880000000001
all right I hope everybody's enjoying

8843.24 --> 8849.6
the

8843.88 --> 8849.599999999999
show talking about prices and all that

8856.52 --> 8859.62
[Music]

8896.279 --> 8902.12
do know oh nothing and be happy

8905.72 --> 8910.24
uh yeah it's just like they were like

8908.319 --> 8912.519999999999
yeah we're going to [ __ ] ruin your

8910.24 --> 8915.119999999999
life and make everybody poor and there's

8912.52 --> 8919.399000000001
literally nothing you can do about it so

8915.12 --> 8922.439
just you have to be happy or the

8919.399 --> 8927.24
detriment you like you can't

8922.439 --> 8929.76
risk burdening your own health by being

8927.24 --> 8930.96
unhappy as we're stealing everything

8929.76 --> 8934.479
from

8930.96 --> 8935.759999999998
you like you have to be happy or you

8934.479 --> 8937.76
won't

8935.76 --> 8939.92
survive yeah that that's what that's

8937.76 --> 8942.439
turning out to be yeah you will owe

8939.92 --> 8945.16
nothing and be happy because if you

8942.439 --> 8948.479000000001
wouldn't be happy after everything

8945.16 --> 8950.0
stolen from you like the risk that would

8948.479 --> 8954.64
pose to your

8950.0 --> 8954.64
health could kill you

8961.359 --> 8966.08
isn't that I mean that's like a layer

8964.359 --> 8968.6
hidden in there that people probably

8966.08 --> 8971.96
didn't even realize it's not that you

8968.6 --> 8974.359
will be happy because you don't own

8971.96 --> 8978.438999999998
anything because you're mind controlled

8974.359 --> 8979.800000000001
and [ __ ] no it's you must be happy

8978.439 --> 8983.960000000001
because if you

8979.8 --> 8987.679999999998
don't you could literally risk

8983.96 --> 8987.679999999998
dying like from the

8987.72 --> 8994.0
stress over a allowing yourself to

8991.52 --> 8996.0
realize fully as what's happened and how

8994.0 --> 8998.04
little you can do about it

8996.0 --> 9001.439
yeah I

8998.04 --> 9003.76
mean yeah it's I'm being all black buil

9001.439 --> 9006.0
again but I mean it is dark but isn't it

9003.76 --> 9011.359
just true you will owe nothing and

9006.0 --> 9014.8
you'll be happy or you'll literally

9011.359 --> 9017.720000000001
die from the stress it's like not like

9014.8 --> 9020.0
you do get the choice whether you'll be

9017.72 --> 9023.278999999999
happy about it or not but if you Cho

9020.0 --> 9026.68
choose not to be happy about it you'll

9023.279 --> 9026.68
probably end up

9026.88 --> 9032.399
dying because allowing yourself to know

9030.24 --> 9034.84
how [ __ ] up the situation is

9032.399 --> 9038.96
consciously is so stressing on your

9034.84 --> 9043.6
system it could literally get you

9038.96 --> 9043.599999999999
killed and that's how it feels to me

9043.88 --> 9049.16
sometimes yeah it's not like you owe

9047.359 --> 9051.399000000001
nothing and you'll be happy because

9049.16 --> 9054.479
you're too stupid to realize you're

9051.399 --> 9058.319
being stolen from no you'll be happy

9054.479 --> 9062.319
because you can't

9058.319 --> 9065.479
afford to experience the realization of

9062.319 --> 9066.479
how horrendous everything is of what

9065.479 --> 9069.76
they've

9066.479 --> 9072.64
done because that could get you

9069.76 --> 9077.72
killed not because somebody's hurting

9072.64 --> 9080.519999999999
you but just from the acute stress of it

9077.72 --> 9082.24
all it could like burn burden your

9080.52 --> 9084.319000000001
system that's already being burdened

9082.24 --> 9086.92
from the poverty and everything to the

9084.319 --> 9089.278999999999
degree where it could get you killed

9086.92 --> 9091.76
because suddenly oh I got this issue you

9089.279 --> 9094.6
go to a hospital dude they'll [ __ ]

9091.76 --> 9096.72
kill you now yeah you go to a hospital

9094.6 --> 9098.84
emergency you don't know what the

9096.72 --> 9100.84
overall state is of the policies of

9098.84 --> 9103.6
whatever is happening they could

9100.84 --> 9108.439
literally just [ __ ] kill you

9103.6 --> 9111.960000000001
now because of some stupid who policy or

9108.439 --> 9113.6
something some procedure that overrides

9111.96 --> 9117.278999999999
the normal

9113.6 --> 9120.279
procedures yeah so yeah you'll be happy

9117.279 --> 9122.84
all right cuz if you're not happy you

9120.279 --> 9127.08
could literally like burden your health

9122.84 --> 9129.24
to the point where you get

9127.08 --> 9131.84
killed by

9129.24 --> 9134.56
accident because of everything not

9131.84 --> 9137.880000000001
working the way it's supposed to anymore

9134.56 --> 9137.88
yeah have ever thought of

9138.56 --> 9143.72
that what do you you guys

9141.0 --> 9145.96
think that is that is that dark enough

9143.72 --> 9145.96
for

9147.6 --> 9151.279
you doesn't seem so funny anymore now

9150.56 --> 9153.64
does

9151.279 --> 9155.2
it was much funnier when you just

9153.64 --> 9157.278999999999
thought like oh you'll own nothing and

9155.2 --> 9159.08
you'll be happy so like oh no that's

9157.279 --> 9162.68
just the retards that's just the retards

9159.08 --> 9166.88
that will buy anything like no what what

9162.68 --> 9170.279
if that's you what if that's you is so

9166.88 --> 9172.88
impoverished so little left for you to

9170.279 --> 9175.52
be able to do about anything that you

9172.88 --> 9178.64
literally have to like mind control

9175.52 --> 9181.880000000001
yourself to be happy or you might get

9178.64 --> 9185.119999999999
yourself killed from the [ __ ] stress

9181.88 --> 9190.16
of everything that's happened yeah how

9185.12 --> 9190.160000000002
about that for a [ __ ] black pill

9202.16 --> 9205.8
peasants unite and form

9215.359 --> 9225.2
Voltron yeah I mean pitch forks and

9221.24 --> 9228.279
torches I think the time is is

9225.2 --> 9230.68
coming I think we're already halfway

9228.279 --> 9233.68
there already halfway there where people

9230.68 --> 9238.56
feel this urge to just start using

9233.68 --> 9240.720000000001
pitchforks and and torches as a

9238.56 --> 9244.119999999999
symbol

9240.72 --> 9246.84
right and in a way isn't it also kind of

9244.12 --> 9246.84
ironic and

9247.08 --> 9253.92
funny torch what's the torch yeah it's

9250.319 --> 9256.96
the symbol of Lucifer what's a pitchfork

9253.92 --> 9256.960000000001
it's a symbol of

9258.52 --> 9265.640000000001
Satan yeah well

9261.279 --> 9268.640000000001
whatever I'm with the pitchforks and the

9265.64 --> 9268.64
Torches

9269.2 --> 9273.68
right I mean that [ __ ] happens when

9271.56 --> 9276.16
there's just no more

9273.68 --> 9279.84
Choice like people are going to

9276.16 --> 9279.84
voluntary choose to

9280.8 --> 9284.92
die

9282.439 --> 9288.64
unless they

9284.92 --> 9291.88
can sufficiently fool themselves into

9288.64 --> 9295.278999999999
thinking that that's right thing to

9291.88 --> 9297.839999999998
do but enough people dying in that

9295.279 --> 9301.0
manner will eventually prevent more

9297.84 --> 9303.880000000001
people from being capable of fooling

9301.0 --> 9306.96
themselves into dying and so a

9303.88 --> 9308.8
resistance is like a natural allergic

9306.96 --> 9311.919999999998
Collective

9308.8 --> 9316.0
response yeah the pitchforks and the

9311.92 --> 9316.0
Torches will

9316.479 --> 9320.64
come

9318.279 --> 9322.800000000001
yeah it's like

9320.64 --> 9325.92
like the forces of araman and Lucifer

9322.8 --> 9327.56
like they they're there they will come

9325.92 --> 9330.479
it's like yeah you have to fight with it

9327.56 --> 9333.039999999999
you can be fooled by it but at some

9330.479 --> 9337.479
point

9333.04 --> 9340.640000000001
right at some point when some group when

9337.479 --> 9344.92
some egos when a group of egos just

9340.64 --> 9347.16
tries to medal with the forces with with

9344.92 --> 9349.359
God himself with the mind control and

9347.16 --> 9352.76
everything at some point these forces

9349.359 --> 9355.399000000001
the dark Forces would just

9352.76 --> 9360.52
emerge from the

9355.399 --> 9360.519999999999
people and put things right it's like

9361.319 --> 9369.24
God like God can also control the dark

9366.6 --> 9372.880000000001
ones right it's all about balance in

9369.24 --> 9374.92
that sense it's like oh yeah it's oh

9372.88 --> 9377.438999999998
it's bad to give into like dark

9374.92 --> 9379.64
seductions and all that but is it also

9377.439 --> 9382.0
bad to give into dark seductions when

9379.64 --> 9384.399
something else is like

9382.0 --> 9387.64
literally trying to make everybody

9384.399 --> 9390.399
[ __ ] and make them kill themselves

9387.64 --> 9394.039999999999
without any regret or shame is it then

9390.399 --> 9398.199999999999
bad in the face of that to give into the

9394.04 --> 9401.399000000001
darkness to stop that you know that's

9398.2 --> 9401.399000000001
that's the age-old

9406.0 --> 9408.399
question

9407.08 --> 9409.539999999999
[Music]

9408.399 --> 9409.81
Camala ah

9409.54 --> 9412.980000000001
[Music]

9409.81 --> 9412.98
[Applause]

9417.68 --> 9423.12
ah no no blue dude they're dude they'll

9421.56 --> 9426.72
just do Biden

9423.12 --> 9429.720000000001
again like it doesn't matter I mean dude

9426.72 --> 9432.08
they'll make Stephen Hawkins president

9429.72 --> 9432.08
if they

9437.6 --> 9443.960000000001
could like it that's the whole new thing

9449.399 --> 9456.64
right I mean why not just make a

9452.72 --> 9458.438999999998
crippled guy that can't actually move

9456.64 --> 9462.599999999999
their

9458.439 --> 9465.76
lips why not make a person like that the

9462.6 --> 9468.439
president why not I thought you were

9465.76 --> 9470.6
trying this sort of thing out like with

9468.439 --> 9472.880000000001
the other Congress guy that had like all

9470.6 --> 9476.720000000001
this brain surgery that could like

9472.88 --> 9478.16
sometimes barely complete a sentence he

9476.72 --> 9481.0
was in the government I thought there

9478.16 --> 9482.96
was a thing you were

9481.0 --> 9485.319
trying

9482.96 --> 9487.479
just I don't know why all these

9485.319 --> 9489.278999999999
Democrats are suddenly even turning on

9487.479 --> 9491.278999999999
Biden it seems like out of character

9489.279 --> 9496.279
like no no that's

9491.279 --> 9500.399000000001
perfect he's a mentally disabled elderly

9496.279 --> 9503.0
person that's what you want as president

9500.399 --> 9504.599999999999
you want you should like if he suddenly

9503.0 --> 9506.88
like can't walk anymore and has to go

9504.6 --> 9509.399000000001
around in a wheelchair that's even

9506.88 --> 9513.199999999999
better that's even

9509.399 --> 9515.599999999999
better like make him completely stoic

9513.2 --> 9518.12
like let him just degenerate until he's

9515.6 --> 9522.319
just like an undead figure that can't

9518.12 --> 9525.240000000002
even talk like at all like never

9522.319 --> 9527.08
talk can't move their lips anymore like

9525.24 --> 9531.16
that's the perfect

9527.08 --> 9534.08
president that's what you want

9531.16 --> 9537.6
yeah because then you could just have

9534.08 --> 9539.8
some AI system roll out whatever the

9537.6 --> 9542.6
hell is supposed to be saying right just

9539.8 --> 9546.16
like with stepen Hawkins yeah fedman

9542.6 --> 9547.720000000001
exactly like isn't that what they want I

9546.16 --> 9550.319
I don't understand why all these

9547.72 --> 9554.119999999999
supposed Democratic media people are now

9550.319 --> 9558.76
suddenly turning on Biden I mean this is

9554.12 --> 9561.2
perfect you wanted the mentally and

9558.76 --> 9564.84
physically incapable

9561.2 --> 9568.279
person why are you turning on

9564.84 --> 9570.52
him I mean a person that's completely

9568.279 --> 9572.76
[ __ ] [ __ ] and still capable of

9570.52 --> 9575.6
communicating and expressing their own

9572.76 --> 9580.279
retardation is a bigger

9575.6 --> 9583.720000000001
risk yeah for your power

9580.279 --> 9586.76
stability than having a

9583.72 --> 9589.479
literally mentally and physically

9586.76 --> 9591.479
disabled person

9589.479 --> 9596.199999999999
because the mentally physically disabled

9591.479 --> 9600.08
person can't accidentally Express their

9596.2 --> 9602.92
retardation it can only express whatever

9600.08 --> 9604.479
it is programmed to express through the

9602.92 --> 9608.56
voice box

9604.479 --> 9612.08
computer right it's better it's better

9608.56 --> 9613.399
that way you don't actually want a

9612.08 --> 9616.92
freaking

9613.399 --> 9619.0
Democrat to be able to be capable of

9616.92 --> 9622.0
speaking and expressing themselves

9619.0 --> 9624.84
because they can literally and is not an

9622.0 --> 9627.68
exagger they can make it

9624.84 --> 9629.6
worse they can actually make things

9627.68 --> 9633.2
worse if you just take a

9629.6 --> 9635.92
completely disabled person well then

9633.2 --> 9639.12
they can't by accident make things worse

9635.92 --> 9641.359
by letting out what is actually inside

9639.12 --> 9641.359
of

9641.439 --> 9649.880000000001
them yeah so I'm argue like no no Biden

9645.279 --> 9652.76
must be president and he must have 100 %

9649.88 --> 9656.119999999999
of the votes and it doesn't matter that

9652.76 --> 9658.92
that's technically impossible and it can

9656.12 --> 9661.279
only happen that way by stealing it and

9658.92 --> 9665.16
like completely resetting the computers

9661.279 --> 9666.76
and everything like just do it just do

9665.16 --> 9669.52
that

9666.76 --> 9672.6
Democrats don't bring out some other

9669.52 --> 9676.24
[ __ ] idiot that's just going to ruin

9672.6 --> 9680.68
things take the completely disabled

9676.24 --> 9680.68
person and make them your president

9680.72 --> 9687.56
and you can just program him

9683.479 --> 9691.0
right program him do say whatever is

9687.56 --> 9695.96
supposed to be saying yeah no more

9691.0 --> 9699.56
accidental flops just the party line as

9695.96 --> 9699.56
programmed that's what you

9705.0 --> 9711.64
want all right I don't know why the hell

9707.76 --> 9711.64
that came up weird

9711.72 --> 9716.0
subject I'm going all over the place

9723.0 --> 9726.6
today half the time is actors playing

9725.64 --> 9729.96
the

9726.6 --> 9733.24
part yeah dude the Hollywood actors like

9729.96 --> 9735.64
getting involved in like the political

9733.24 --> 9738.88
[ __ ] that's

9735.64 --> 9741.56
like I mean that is like palpably Emar

9738.88 --> 9744.24
that's like so painful like it literally

9741.56 --> 9748.359
like hurts my heart every time I see

9744.24 --> 9751.24
that like what the [ __ ]

9748.359 --> 9753.84
man like when these actors start

9751.24 --> 9757.88
involving themselves in politics it like

9753.84 --> 9760.399
physically hurts me to witness that like

9757.88 --> 9765.8
I can't imagine what would be going

9760.399 --> 9768.8
through them when just witnessing it

9765.8 --> 9771.119999999999
just physically hurts me I mean holy

9768.8 --> 9771.119999999999
[ __ ]

9773.92 --> 9776.0
I

9777.96 --> 9783.319
mean like when those actors just doing

9780.8 --> 9786.199999999999
that like I have to put my hands in

9783.319 --> 9790.319
front of my face like even though I am

9786.2 --> 9793.960000000001
alone I'm alone here no camera on me I'm

9790.319 --> 9796.88
watching a computer screen I see that

9793.96 --> 9798.919999999998
like an actor suddenly walking up to the

9796.88 --> 9802.119999999999
stage in one of these political thingies

9798.92 --> 9805.92
and I'm like oh no oh oh this is going

9802.12 --> 9809.399000000001
to be terrible like and there's nobody

9805.92 --> 9812.52
watching okay and still I put the hands

9809.399 --> 9816.439
in front of my face because of just how

9812.52 --> 9816.439
mortifyingly embarrassing this

9817.16 --> 9823.399
is that not as

9820.08 --> 9825.76
some demonstrative acting or anything

9823.399 --> 9830.199999999999
it's just that just naturally happens

9825.76 --> 9830.2
even if nobody's seeing me

9843.08 --> 9849.08
right yeah Bo just yeah Nigel farage is

9846.319 --> 9853.359
making a lot of rounds

9849.08 --> 9853.359
again I hear he's kind of crushing

9854.319 --> 9860.359
it he certainly being hyped up a lot

9871.64 --> 9875.76
trying to cast a gross cup

9875.96 --> 9884.16
politician the new ah which one was that

9881.52 --> 9887.319000000001
again it's a Gavin

9884.16 --> 9891.039999999999
Nome oh God that

9887.319 --> 9891.039999999999
guy yeah I mean

9892.76 --> 9896.84
dude I mean he could be like a

9895.08 --> 9899.72
politician in

9896.84 --> 9904.319
Robocop he's that

9899.72 --> 9907.479
bad am I right like he is like a

9904.319 --> 9910.72
Robocop universe level

9907.479 --> 9915.039999999999
politician just he looks like it he acts

9910.72 --> 9917.358999999999
like it he is like provably that

9915.04 --> 9920.359
corrupt it's just like that guy just

9917.359 --> 9922.76
came from the RoboCop univ or something

9920.359 --> 9922.76
what the

9924.76 --> 9928.279
[ __ ] you know what I

9932.56 --> 9937.84
mean

9935.439 --> 9940.359
yeah I'm talking about this Gavin

9937.84 --> 9942.08
Newsome guy I've been seeing a lot of

9940.359 --> 9944.6
that through

9942.08 --> 9948.64
Infowars but I mean Nigel farage is

9944.6 --> 9948.640000000001
being pushed but I mean

9949.16 --> 9954.08
I think it's just because like there is

9951.04 --> 9957.560000000001
just a a government crisis overall in

9954.08 --> 9960.52
England it's getting so bad so unstable

9957.56 --> 9962.92
it's like they have to get verage in

9960.52 --> 9965.92
there cuz he's the only thing that's

9962.92 --> 9968.6
going to be able to keep it

9965.92 --> 9973.2
together I mean it's not even about like

9968.6 --> 9976.640000000001
oh we can't let the the populist win no

9973.2 --> 9979.76
it's about if we don't put him in

9976.64 --> 9983.64
like there's going to be total Civil War

9979.76 --> 9985.880000000001
chaos I mean it is like like that it's

9983.64 --> 9987.96
not even like oh we don't really want

9985.88 --> 9990.64
him like yeah but he's like the only

9987.96 --> 9993.119999999999
thing that can prevent like total death

9990.64 --> 9995.92
and Chaos of everybody including the

9993.12 --> 9999.880000000001
police and the

9995.92 --> 9999.88
government it feels like

10002.8 --> 10010.16
that our beloved Governor here in

10006.64 --> 10012.88
California that guy Gavin Newsome and

10010.16 --> 10012.88
like holy

10015.16 --> 10021.279
[ __ ] I mean he really is like a

10017.8 --> 10024.479
stereotype villain politician like from

10021.279 --> 10026.6
the RoboCop Universe it really is like

10024.479 --> 10028.599999999999
that I don't think I've ever like

10026.6 --> 10032.16
addressed him before but every time you

10028.6 --> 10032.16
see him it's it's

10034.8 --> 10039.119999999999
like I mean he's

10039.8 --> 10047.96
it's almost like he's actually an actor

10043.72 --> 10051.599999999999
acting that fish politician

10047.96 --> 10055.16
role I wonder like what does he actually

10051.6 --> 10056.52
see his job like he's acting like an

10055.16 --> 10059.84
evil

10056.52 --> 10062.279
guy does it look like is the experience

10059.84 --> 10065.68
to him like that is it like he's playing

10062.279 --> 10067.399000000001
a role in a movie that's called

10065.68 --> 10070.960000000001
politics

10067.399 --> 10074.319
or God for for bid is he actually like

10070.96 --> 10080.519999999999
that I mean what the

10074.319 --> 10080.519999999999
hell that's your natural person holy

10082.6 --> 10088.399000000001
[ __ ] I mean you got to

10085.319 --> 10090.92
laugh if that's actually his normal

10088.399 --> 10094.399
person if he's just like that like what

10090.92 --> 10094.399
the [ __ ]

10102.72 --> 10105.679999999998

anyway weird things going on out

10119.8 --> 10127.039999999999
there a little from column a little from

10123.56 --> 10127.039999999999
what does that mean

10133.359 --> 10139.68
it just I mean the guy just basically

10136.439 --> 10142.800000000001
serves whatever dark force is necessary

10139.68 --> 10146.359
it's like he'll he'll play the part for

10142.8 --> 10149.759999999998
Lucifer and he'll do the things for

10146.359 --> 10153.0
arimon like without any

10149.76 --> 10156.12
objection like effectively the guy must

10153.0 --> 10159.04
be I mean there's no choice he must be

10156.12 --> 10162.68
Psychopathic or you wouldn't be able to

10159.04 --> 10164.640000000001
do that you wouldn't be capable of doing

10162.68 --> 10167.960000000001
all those

10164.64 --> 10171.239
things like you would get sick you'd get

10167.96 --> 10174.319
sick from the inner anguish of it and

10171.239 --> 10177.239
die or get in an accident or get in

10178.8 --> 10185.319
anything like there's no choice like he

10183.04 --> 10187.279
must be a

10185.319 --> 10190.64
psychopath otherwise he wouldn't be able

10187.279 --> 10190.640000000001
to do it like that

10194.399 --> 10201.358999999999

show if you are then please don't forget

10207.2 --> 10210.0
to Rogan it

10217.64 --> 10221.68
up for

10277.52 --> 10280.52
yeah

10307.52 --> 10311.560000000001
e e

10342.33 --> 10348.2
[Music]

10345.72 --> 10348.199999999999
and I'm

10348.319 --> 10351.319
back

10358.0 --> 10362.92
oh these people are all about the money

10360.88 --> 10364.839999999998
like Pelosi yeah they're all about being

10362.92 --> 10368.16
provided for they're actors and they're

10364.84 --> 10372.239
like as long as we just always get the

10368.16 --> 10374.6
in come will act whatever is

10372.239 --> 10376.96
necessary whether it contradicts a

10374.6 --> 10379.6
previous act they don't care I mean they

10376.96 --> 10384.599999999999
are literally like political

10379.6 --> 10384.6
actors like in the way they operate

10401.56 --> 10406.319
the course

10403.479 --> 10408.92
correction

10406.319 --> 10411.359
yeah definitely that one guy good to see

10408.92 --> 10411.359
you by the

10421.0 --> 10426.0
way but I mean an overreaction in what

10424.2 --> 10428.76
way

10426.0 --> 10432.88
though I mean I think what would be best

10428.76 --> 10432.880000000001
for the United States is if they

10433.399 --> 10441.08
just basically the Empire and the power

10437.479 --> 10444.239
of it is ending so it there's only one

10441.08 --> 10447.399
way to actually fix it or you can't

10444.239 --> 10451.439
really fix it but to basically become

10447.399 --> 10454.88
have something good new emerge or start

10451.439 --> 10457.800000000001
over and that would have to be basically

10454.88 --> 10458.96
by getting all the money connections out

10457.8 --> 10462.679999999998
of there

10458.96 --> 10462.679999999998
and then just start with

10466.92 --> 10471.76
labor like rebuilding

10477.56 --> 10484.16
it right an an idea of how you could do

10481.319 --> 10487.0
it perhaps would be to just do a

10484.16 --> 10489.6
complete Financial

10487.0 --> 10490.92
default and just start with a labor

10489.6 --> 10493.6
economy from

10490.92 --> 10495.279
scratch it's like yeah it doesn't matter

10493.6 --> 10497.399000000001
what kind of paper you have it only

10495.279 --> 10500.279
matters is what is the labor that you

10497.399 --> 10502.88
can provide and

10500.279 --> 10505.880000000001
that's that's going to be the economy

10502.88 --> 10505.88
now

10518.479 --> 10522.278999999999
party RFK junr has a good

10523.68 --> 10530.479000000001
chance maybe maybe seing star water I

10526.479 --> 10530.479
mean I'm hearing some things of

10531.04 --> 10540.12
RFK but I mean he is a Sly one though he

10536.439 --> 10540.12
is not super

10540.92 --> 10548.960000000001
trustworthy I mean he is like if he

10544.92 --> 10551.8
actually become president

10548.96 --> 10554.0
I mean he would literally just rub

10551.8 --> 10557.56
elbows immediately with the military

10554.0 --> 10559.88
industrial complex like he might be all

10557.56 --> 10561.439
supposedly peace president or whatever

10559.88 --> 10563.679999999998
like there's no way that that's real I

10561.439 --> 10567.319
mean he's a Democrat

10563.68 --> 10567.319
yeah they're not

10567.439 --> 10571.720000000001
peaceful they use the military

10569.479 --> 10575.039999999999
industrial complex all of them they all

10571.72 --> 10575.039999999999
do that

10579.279 --> 10586.279
and so will RFK you will just

10581.12 --> 10586.279
immediately start playing with that

10609.52 --> 10614.84
had a good chance yeah I mean I don't

10612.64 --> 10616.68
know man I don't even know if elections

10614.84 --> 10618.72
are still going to work the way that

10616.68 --> 10621.720000000001
they're supposed to be

10618.72 --> 10621.72
working

10622.39 --> 10627.519999999999
[Music]

10624.84 --> 10631.68
seriously I think that at least the

10627.52 --> 10635.279
Democrats think that they just have full

10631.68 --> 10638.68
control of it that they can just rake

10635.279 --> 10638.68
things now

10642.68 --> 10650.56
the other two jump the sh what in what

10646.56 --> 10650.56
sense what do you mean jump the

10656.6 --> 10664.84
shark like who how did they jump the

10660.359 --> 10664.84
shark I get it

10685.16 --> 10689.039999999999
no I think that Biden could be the

10687.0 --> 10690.64
perfect US

10689.04 --> 10693.560000000001
president

10690.64 --> 10696.358999999999
like in a

10693.56 --> 10699.64
wheelchair barely able to speak it would

10696.359 --> 10699.640000000001
be perfect

10700.16 --> 10702.72
he can do

10706.64 --> 10711.0
it their moment has

10711.08 --> 10716.359
passed I don't know seeking star water I

10714.12 --> 10716.359
don't

10724.68 --> 10732.439
know I mean like Trump has plenty of

10728.84 --> 10735.6
issues of obviously people know about

10732.439 --> 10739.720000000001
that right but and he's had the

10735.6 --> 10739.720000000001
operation warp speed that's a

10741.319 --> 10745.56
problem but I don't know why

10747.08 --> 10754.2
that's hair sniffing guy in a

10751.72 --> 10756.479
wheelchair how the hell are you capable

10754.2 --> 10760.04
of saying that

10756.479 --> 10760.039999999999

10786.359 --> 10790.6
what how in the hell is is that

10799.479 --> 10807.599999999999
