right

92.159 --> 95.36
so whether today is

96.24 --> 100.79899999999999
even more of a gray soup than it was

98.24 --> 102.96
yesterday although it's not really like

100.799 --> 105.759
cloud bags there's some

102.96 --> 108.55999999999999
sunlight still kind of like

105.759 --> 108.56
coming through it

110.32 --> 117.91999999999999
and yeah it's kind of wind still so

114.079 --> 117.91999999999999
yeah i guess typical winter's day

118.719 --> 124.24
i actually saw the magpie

121.759 --> 126.96
like getting into that nest again

124.24 --> 128.959
i don't know whether it's just like

126.96 --> 131.51999999999998
preparing for the spring or if they're

128.959 --> 133.28
like going for an early spring but it

131.52 --> 135.12
seemed like

133.28 --> 138.319
they're nesting again

135.12 --> 138.31900000000002
it's just very early

139.76 --> 145.92
or maybe they're just like simulating it

143.76 --> 148.239
because they really want to can't wait

145.92 --> 150.48
for the spring either

148.239 --> 150.48000000000002
right

150.879 --> 154.79999999999998
and who could blame him you know

155.44 --> 158.879
all right

156.48 --> 161.67999999999998
hello wrath first in chat america silver

158.879 --> 165.67999999999998
patriot bill nye the science denier yes

161.68 --> 165.68
will soaring good to see you all

165.92 --> 172.0
it's a little late today ryan arthurton

168.8 --> 174.87900000000002
good to see you because yeah the getting

172.0 --> 176.8
my washing machine repaired i was really

174.879 --> 178.64
nervous about that

176.8 --> 180.64000000000001
because i had to basically take a bit of

178.64 --> 182.79999999999998
a risk

180.64 --> 184.319
lay down some money just to get it

182.8 --> 186.08
checked

184.319 --> 187.599
and then i didn't know if it was going

186.08 --> 190.08
to actually be

187.599 --> 191.76
well decent repairable for a decent

190.08 --> 194.15900000000002
price but it seemed like it actually

191.76 --> 197.28
worked out

194.159 --> 198.879
so it was a successful

197.28 --> 201.36
endeavor

198.879 --> 203.12
what makes me very nervous right also

201.36 --> 205.59900000000002
because i kind of care about that

203.12 --> 207.84
washing machines my first

205.599 --> 210.07999999999998
washing machine that i chose from the

207.84 --> 212.959
store like in 2008 so it's already kind

210.08 --> 216.48000000000002
of old but it works great

212.959 --> 219.599
just the internal workings is

216.48 --> 221.84
yeah the uh the suspension system like

219.599 --> 224.07999999999998
the actual physical

221.84 --> 224.959
pieces the plastic and all that's inside

224.08 --> 226.4
of there

224.959 --> 229.599
the drum

226.4 --> 233.519
like that has worn because it's old

229.599 --> 235.76
uh but it could actually be replaced

233.519 --> 237.76
for a price that would be lower than to

235.76 --> 239.84
just replace the entire washing machine

237.76 --> 243.28
with the second hand device that you

239.84 --> 243.28
don't know what's been in there

243.519 --> 248.64000000000001
so yeah i'm very happy

245.76 --> 251.439
that that actually worked out

248.64 --> 254.67999999999998
but yeah he came pretty much right at

251.439 --> 254.68
one o'clock

255.76 --> 258.479
right but anyway

257.44 --> 262.239
yeah

258.479 --> 262.239
it's it's still a bit of a bill

262.32 --> 266.32
now i think i can split it three ways or

264.88 --> 267.6
four ways

266.32 --> 270.15999999999997
four ways

267.6 --> 272.88
right uh that would

270.16 --> 272.88000000000005
make it like

273.68 --> 277.759
was it

274.639 --> 279.68
i think 70 euros

277.759 --> 282.72
and then i still have to like retrieve

279.68 --> 284.88
that from my roommate so yeah i could

282.72 --> 287.36
certainly use the support on the short

284.88 --> 290.15999999999997
run i was only able to do it right now

287.36 --> 292.47900000000004
because just my money from my welfare

290.16 --> 295.36
came in so that i have like a chunk of

292.479 --> 297.03999999999996
money to do that with

295.36 --> 299.04
uh

297.04 --> 301.759
older model it's not battle it's not

299.04 --> 304.40000000000003
like a super old model it's still

301.759 --> 304.40000000000003
electronic

304.479 --> 312.15999999999997
but yeah it has served me very well and

307.36 --> 312.16
in all that time and having been moved

312.8 --> 315.039
like

315.36 --> 320.40000000000003
three times or so three or four times

318.08 --> 322.639
it's never broken down

320.4 --> 324.96
ever not a single time did anything go

322.639 --> 327.52
wrong with it it's just that some parts

324.96 --> 330.15999999999997
have now worn out

327.52 --> 332.0
and they can be replaced and it's yeah

330.16 --> 334.32000000000005
for a doable price and then if

332.0 --> 336.84
everything is all right all the

334.32 --> 340.15999999999997
parts that had

336.84 --> 342.4
basically fatigue

340.16 --> 344.40000000000003
so they basically got demolished from

342.4 --> 346.88
just doing what they do but if that's

344.4 --> 349.19899999999996
replaced then it should go i don't know

346.88 --> 351.68
i don't know how long maybe another 10

349.199 --> 353.84000000000003
years if i'm lucky

351.68 --> 353.84000000000003
right

354.32 --> 359.12
but no it's not that old model it's from

356.24 --> 359.12
2008

363.039 --> 368.479
but yeah

365.84 --> 369.59999999999997
since i'm kind of a bit of an animist i

368.479 --> 371.44
do

369.6 --> 374.47900000000004
basically

371.44 --> 376.96
attain a more spiritual relation with my

374.479 --> 379.68
devices just like with my computer

376.96 --> 381.19899999999996
with my computer even more

379.68 --> 383.28000000000003
and i think that

381.199 --> 386.40000000000003
if you like really care for your

383.28 --> 389.039
equipment and you understand how it

386.4 --> 390.79999999999995
works and its feel

389.039 --> 392.4
and its limits

390.8 --> 395.28000000000003
that just like with a very good

392.4 --> 398.08
relationship with the person

395.28 --> 401.039
it just lasts longer

398.08 --> 403.35999999999996
and that's what i've been living on for

401.039 --> 405.28
well for 20 years

403.36 --> 409.52000000000004
on that principle and it's worked it's

405.28 --> 413.599
worked really well but then yes sadly

409.52 --> 413.599
things break all all at the same time

414.0 --> 417.28
can't really avoid that

418.0 --> 422.72
but it's not like the washing machine

419.759 --> 424.08000000000004
had like dozens and dozens of flaws and

422.72 --> 425.84000000000003
it's like oh

424.08 --> 427.199
always have to keep repairing no no no

425.84 --> 429.52
no it's just

427.199 --> 430.639
it's never broken down ever in all that

429.52 --> 432.96
time

430.639 --> 435.52
anyway

432.96 --> 437.75899999999996
dog ears wear out easy thing what dog

435.52 --> 440.15999999999997
ears what

437.759 --> 441.199
no it was the suspension it was the the

440.16 --> 443.44
drum

441.199 --> 446.08000000000004
and its suspension

443.44 --> 448.88
just like plastic parts

446.08 --> 451.599
they broke

448.88 --> 453.68
so like the internal workings have to be

451.599 --> 456.639
replaced but they they said they had no

453.68 --> 456.639
problem doing that

458.72 --> 463.36
i'm without a dryer right now

462.08 --> 466.15999999999997
dryers

463.36 --> 467.36
that's hilarious

466.16 --> 471.12
yeah now

467.36 --> 471.12
we just do use a uh

471.52 --> 474.24
what do you call the

474.319 --> 479.56
washing rack for that we don't have a

476.56 --> 479.56
dryer

482.319 --> 485.759
no

483.039 --> 487.599
i can handle my wash like drying half a

485.759 --> 488.879
day no problem

487.599 --> 491.36
anyway yeah

488.879 --> 493.59900000000005
super interesting right i mean that's

491.36 --> 495.91900000000004
what you tune in for flat earth early

493.599 --> 498.24
bird show to hear about arwen explaining

495.919 --> 500.24
everything about his old washing machine

498.24 --> 502.319
and how it's getting repaired i know

500.24 --> 505.039
that's what you specifically tuned into

502.319 --> 505.03900000000004
the show for

505.36 --> 509.84000000000003
but yeah it's important to me

510.639 --> 514.399
and i'm just

512.159 --> 516.959
it's kind of been sitting on me sounds

514.399 --> 518.959
really silly like like oh

516.959 --> 521.3599999999999
oh this person's mother's dying or

518.959 --> 523.3599999999999
something and yeah i feel terrible

521.36 --> 525.519
and our wind's feeling terrible but i'm

523.36 --> 526.8000000000001
like yeah it's because my washing

525.519 --> 530.64
machine

526.8 --> 533.1999999999999
i know that sounds really silly i know

530.64 --> 535.04
i can't help it i'm trying to deal with

533.2 --> 538.24
it it is

535.04 --> 539.279
in the new owen benjamin

538.24 --> 541.519
lore

539.279 --> 542.56
it's the watico

541.519 --> 545.279
i

542.56 --> 548.16
one of my punishments one of my main

545.279 --> 550.48
challenges is that i get very very

548.16 --> 552.64
attached to things like

550.48 --> 555.519
really attached to things

552.64 --> 558.0
not to the point that i like horde

555.519 --> 559.839
like old garbage

558.0 --> 562.08
thank god i don't do that

559.839 --> 564.32
but like as long as things actually

562.08 --> 567.9200000000001
function

564.32 --> 571.519
it's almost like i'm in love with them

567.92 --> 573.1999999999999
that's why when i had to put my car away

571.519 --> 575.76
what is it now two years ago or

573.2 --> 578.32
something or three years ago that like

575.76 --> 580.64
really broke my heart because

578.32 --> 583.44
it still worked great

580.64 --> 583.4399999999999
and that's like

583.519 --> 588.72
just feels like sending like a pet to

585.68 --> 591.5999999999999
the slaughter or something it's terrible

588.72 --> 593.9200000000001
it literally was mortifying to me at the

591.6 --> 593.9200000000001
time

596.08 --> 601.6800000000001
one person's garbage yeah no but i'm

598.0 --> 601.68
talking about actual garbage like

603.2 --> 607.76
just old broken stuff that will never

606.0 --> 611.76
work again ever

607.76 --> 614.0
i don't hoard like that crap thanks

611.76 --> 615.36
but as long as things function i'm

614.0 --> 617.839
always like

615.36 --> 621.519
keep it alive i want everything to

617.839 --> 624.0790000000001
become old and wise

621.519 --> 625.92
and it's just

624.079 --> 628.7199999999999
does that make any sense

625.92 --> 630.88
i just want i don't like oh new stuff oh

628.72 --> 633.6
it's it's the older model i'm just gonna

630.88 --> 636.0
replace it now no i'm like no

633.6 --> 640.32
i wanna see this thing through to the

636.0 --> 643.12
end if i'm gonna buy a device i want it

640.32 --> 646.0
basically i want it to run so long and

643.12 --> 649.76
then at some point it just explodes or

646.0 --> 653.68
something at a venerable age right

649.76 --> 653.68
don't explode computer please

656.32 --> 661.519
but that's just the way that i

658.839 --> 663.9200000000001
work why did you have to get rid of my

661.519 --> 666.16
car because i couldn't pay for it that's

663.92 --> 666.16
why

667.92 --> 671.279
it required

669.36 --> 674.399
like my my car was a bigger problem

671.279 --> 677.6
because it had all it was old it had

674.399 --> 682.88
worn on so many ways

677.6 --> 682.88
it's just that the engine was amazing

683.44 --> 688.72
like that thing never faltered but like

686.079 --> 691.12
everything else like started to just

688.72 --> 692.24
grow old and

691.12 --> 695.04
yeah

692.24 --> 697.6800000000001
but yeah that was a car from like

695.04 --> 697.68
98

698.56 --> 703.3599999999999
and it wasn't like it was stored in a

700.72 --> 705.6
garage all the time so it had had been

703.36 --> 708.399
facing the elements like pretty much its

705.6 --> 710.9590000000001
entire life and yeah you just as a car

708.399 --> 714.24
eventually it just starts to crumble

710.959 --> 714.2399999999999
every part starts to crumble

715.44 --> 720.399
and that's extremely expensive so

718.16 --> 723.1999999999999
yeah but i do still miss it

720.399 --> 725.76
i miss being able to drive and

723.2 --> 727.2
especially dude if i'd had a car like

725.76 --> 728.8389999999999
getting my computer fixed would have

727.2 --> 733.2
been so

728.839 --> 735.7600000000001
easy but yeah i don't have that anymore

733.2 --> 739.839
right so yay

735.76 --> 739.8389999999999
living with poverty how do you do it

739.92 --> 742.92
well

744.399 --> 748.56
i.e back among other things

750.399 --> 756.079
yeah loss of entropy indeed

753.76 --> 757.36
was it a dutch manufactured car no it

756.079 --> 761.279
was french

757.36 --> 763.839
it's a citroen sucks uh

761.279 --> 766.0
an automatic

763.839 --> 767.36
is it a one point

766.0 --> 770.639
one point

767.36 --> 772.48
two or one point four liters

770.639 --> 775.279
awesome little car

772.48 --> 778.0
like basically just a little car with a

775.279 --> 778.0
big engine

779.76 --> 783.88
they don't make them like that anymore

794.16 --> 798.3199999999999
i don't even know any dutch manufactured

796.72 --> 801.839
cars

798.32 --> 801.839
i don't think there is any

803.6 --> 808.399
it's all like french and

806.079 --> 810.3199999999999
german and

808.399 --> 814.36
oh every other

810.32 --> 814.36
relatively big country

814.8 --> 818.56
but maybe i'm wrong maybe there is like

816.399 --> 822.6
a car manufacturer in the netherlands

818.56 --> 822.5999999999999
but i don't know about it

829.279 --> 832.8
99 is superman

834.88 --> 837.199
all right

839.279 --> 846.88
yeah well like the late 90s were was a

842.48 --> 848.9590000000001
good year for cars because that's like

846.88 --> 850.959
right in the peak

848.959 --> 854.8
of a certain type of engineering

850.959 --> 857.199
development right before they started to

854.8 --> 860.16
adapt everything to the new [ __ ] and

857.199 --> 862.399
make it all electronic and

860.16 --> 864.7199999999999
right because that's garbage i don't

862.399 --> 865.76
like that i don't like the electronic

864.72 --> 867.279
garbage

865.76 --> 869.04
a car shouldn't

867.279 --> 870.56
like even technically have to be

869.04 --> 873.279
electronic

870.56 --> 873.279
in my opinion

878.88 --> 882.48
there's a lot of electric vehicles on

880.399 --> 883.6
the road yes there is

882.48 --> 888.1990000000001
but that doesn't mean that they're

883.6 --> 888.1990000000001
manufactured in the netherlands though

904.8 --> 910.3199999999999
but yes steamy traveler i think that

907.519 --> 912.48
like a third or half of the cars that i

910.32 --> 916.1990000000001
see out there now are electronic

912.48 --> 916.1990000000001
there's a lot of them

932.639 --> 937.16
right

934.16 --> 937.16
anyway

941.199 --> 943.92
i could sure

944.079 --> 948.3199999999999
use some paypal support if you know what

946.399 --> 950.399
i mean

948.32 --> 951.519
i was already kind of on a tight budget

950.399 --> 954.079
but

951.519 --> 957.279
with this on top i like i really do need

954.079 --> 959.199
to support and i've been getting it

957.279 --> 962.24
here and there

959.199 --> 962.24
if all possible

962.72 --> 967.8000000000001
help me out

964.8 --> 967.8
anyway

970.24 --> 975.04
it was around the time they changed

971.68 --> 975.04
everything to fiberglass

976.639 --> 978.9590000000001
right

981.68 --> 988.8
oh adam price technically the fiberglass

984.8 --> 991.3599999999999
suspension or is it not suspension the

988.8 --> 994.56
fiberglass cover for cars is not really

991.36 --> 997.04
a bad idea it works great and it's very

994.56 --> 999.279
easily replaceable

997.04 --> 999.279
but

1000.0 --> 1004.839
that's not the issue

1002.48 --> 1007.839
i think that the issue is like the

1004.839 --> 1010.5600000000001
electronization of everything

1007.839 --> 1013.2790000000001
and that came with like

1010.56 --> 1014.959
yeah all kinds of garbage

1013.279 --> 1017.759
like the

1014.959 --> 1020.3199999999999
all these electronic

1017.759 --> 1021.6800000000001
things that you have to

1020.32 --> 1025.839
attune

1021.68 --> 1025.839
or it just won't even work the car

1025.919 --> 1031.199
right that's all mod that's like the

1028.0 --> 1033.439
modernization that happened pretty much

1031.199 --> 1035.439
with the new century

1033.439 --> 1036.559
and

1035.439 --> 1039.199
yeah

1036.559 --> 1041.12
i don't really like it now i bet that

1039.199 --> 1043.919
since that time it's been

1041.12 --> 1044.9589999999998
refined a lot so there's less issues

1043.919 --> 1046.5590000000002
with it

1044.959 --> 1050.039
but still i never really thought that

1046.559 --> 1050.039
was a good idea

1052.32 --> 1058.32
yeah the more computer parts

1055.679 --> 1060.88
something has the more it tends to break

1058.32 --> 1060.8799999999999
over time

1064.4 --> 1068.5590000000002
and then when it does

1066.48 --> 1072.0
you're like really

1068.559 --> 1073.84
yeah it's just a real nuisance because

1072.0 --> 1075.679
if you're like a car mechanic type of

1073.84 --> 1079.76
guy

1075.679 --> 1084.3200000000002
then you can mostly fix your own car

1079.76 --> 1084.32
but not all the electronic crap right

1084.88 --> 1089.2800000000002
when that [ __ ] breaks you just gotta

1086.559 --> 1089.28
replace it

1091.039 --> 1095.799
and that's a hassle so i've heard

1102.72 --> 1108.76
yeah exactly rocket man

1104.88 --> 1108.7600000000002
yeah it's annoying

1114.96 --> 1117.2
right

1120.559 --> 1125.2
especially if you're like

1123.2 --> 1126.88
out in the country

1125.2 --> 1129.2
i mean if you're like in the city it

1126.88 --> 1131.2800000000002
doesn't really matter that much

1129.2 --> 1134.32
but if you're like kind of in the middle

1131.28 --> 1136.96
of nowhere you just want to be able to

1134.32 --> 1139.6
manually repair your car or quickly get

1136.96 --> 1143.28
a repair guy or something

1139.6 --> 1143.28
or your neighbor that can do it

1144.0 --> 1147.679
to quickly be able to fix it

1149.52 --> 1153.76
you don't want to have to like have your

1151.52 --> 1155.679
car collected to a shop in order to hook

1153.76 --> 1159.2
it up to some computer

1155.679 --> 1159.2
that's just really annoying

1163.12 --> 1167.12
oh what

1164.64 --> 1169.2
new cars with bluetooth wi-fi

1167.12 --> 1170.8799999999999
able to be hacked oh god i didn't even

1169.2 --> 1174.559
know that

1170.88 --> 1174.5590000000002
there's no surprise to me though

1175.679 --> 1180.24
that i don't want that like if i ever

1177.919 --> 1182.5590000000002
for some reason was able to get a new

1180.24 --> 1184.799
car the first thing i told them i want

1182.559 --> 1189.6
this thing stripped

1184.799 --> 1191.9189999999999
of all wireless communication devices

1189.6 --> 1194.9599999999998
like i'm not gonna buy it unless you

1191.919 --> 1194.96
strip it off that

1201.039 --> 1206.08
right

1202.96 --> 1207.919
except maybe for like a gps system if

1206.08 --> 1210.96
that comes with that

1207.919 --> 1212.88
yeah should still be able to

1210.96 --> 1215.76
like do that

1212.88 --> 1217.8400000000001
but everything else no just completely

1215.76 --> 1220.4
just i don't even want to turn off i

1217.84 --> 1222.6399999999999
just want it stripped out of there cut

1220.4 --> 1224.72
the wires i don't want that garbage in

1222.64 --> 1226.0800000000002
there at all

1224.72 --> 1228.96
because if you leave it there you turn

1226.08 --> 1231.36
it off oh yeah i know i'm sure there's

1228.96 --> 1232.64
ways that external

1231.36 --> 1235.039
people

1232.64 --> 1236.5590000000002
can just turn it on again without you

1235.039 --> 1240.64
knowing

1236.559 --> 1244.44
so just cut the device out of it

1240.64 --> 1244.44
that's what i would want

1265.44 --> 1270.44
what this can turn off your engine okay

1282.64 --> 1284.96
hmm

1285.36 --> 1288.799
well i wasn't planning on running from

1287.2 --> 1290.96
any police cars

1288.799 --> 1292.96
with my car whatever i was gonna do

1290.96 --> 1293.919
anyway so

1292.96 --> 1295.8400000000001
weird

1293.919 --> 1300.6000000000001
i guess it could be kind of handy if

1295.84 --> 1300.6
your car gets like stolen or something

1314.0 --> 1319.84
regarding this if you don't pay they

1316.159 --> 1319.8400000000001
shut her down oh

1322.559 --> 1326.1589999999999
hopefully they won't hack our winds

1324.48 --> 1329.84
toothbrush

1326.159 --> 1329.8400000000001
hello i don't think it has a

1330.0 --> 1336.159
any capacity to be hacked

1333.52 --> 1337.6
besides the worst that any hacking of it

1336.159 --> 1340.5590000000002
could do is just

1337.6 --> 1344.039
turn it off and on at very inconvenient

1340.559 --> 1344.039
times or something

1346.64 --> 1349.64
now

1390.96 --> 1393.28
hmm

1397.039 --> 1401.039
the government can see inside my

1399.039 --> 1402.96
apartment and know what

1401.039 --> 1406.0
my i'm thinking about

1402.96 --> 1408.48
yeah it's called the early bird show

1406.0 --> 1409.44
like anybody can watch it and literally

1408.48 --> 1411.84
just

1409.44 --> 1413.52
know what i'm thinking about because i'm

1411.84 --> 1415.76
just talking about what i'm thinking

1413.52 --> 1415.76
about

1431.36 --> 1437.279
yeah rocket man i know it's annoying

1434.0 --> 1440.48
it's like on purpose downgrading

1437.279 --> 1440.48
like i think that

1441.679 --> 1446.159
i maybe it's already out there where you

1444.0 --> 1450.88
can literally take old apple computers

1446.159 --> 1450.88
or all iphones and just hack them

1451.039 --> 1457.039
so you just basically rob them off the

1453.679 --> 1461.3600000000001
iphone or of the apple system

1457.039 --> 1462.48
use what it is and then cut it off

1461.36 --> 1464.8799999999999
from

1462.48 --> 1466.32
yeah the apple

1464.88 --> 1468.88
network

1466.32 --> 1470.48
so it can like completely independently

1468.88 --> 1473.8400000000001
function kind of what they did for

1470.48 --> 1473.84
example to the old xbox

1475.039 --> 1480.32
that can be converted in like a

1477.039 --> 1482.799
completely independent multimedia system

1480.32 --> 1484.72
that works amazingly well for such an

1482.799 --> 1485.6
old device

1484.72 --> 1487.1200000000001
right

1485.6 --> 1489.6789999999999
i've always wondered like couldn't you

1487.12 --> 1491.039
do that with like iphones too

1489.679 --> 1493.76
when they're all like oh it's not

1491.039 --> 1495.2
working anymore it's too slow yeah just

1493.76 --> 1496.32
literally

1495.2 --> 1499.279
wipe it

1496.32 --> 1503.36
reinstall a separate system on it and

1499.279 --> 1503.36
it'll be like it's brand new

1506.08 --> 1509.9189999999999
i don't know if it's out there it's

1507.76 --> 1512.799
still not going to make me get a

1509.919 --> 1512.7990000000002
smartphone

1512.84 --> 1518.039
right staying away from that [ __ ]

1522.68 --> 1525.749
[Music]

1537.36 --> 1542.7199999999998
right but i think that in general that

1540.32 --> 1546.08
is what people should be doing right

1542.72 --> 1547.76
i mean everybody in the industries

1546.08 --> 1549.6789999999999
for the last few decades have always

1547.76 --> 1553.12
been complaining or for the last half a

1549.679 --> 1555.279
century that oh but china is always

1553.12 --> 1558.2399999999998
stealing our patents and then building

1555.279 --> 1560.4
something really cheap an imitation

1558.24 --> 1562.72
they used to be very sucky now they're

1560.4 --> 1566.0800000000002
actually kind of good

1562.72 --> 1567.1200000000001
like they actually built good stuff

1566.08 --> 1568.799
right

1567.12 --> 1570.6399999999999
samsung is

1568.799 --> 1572.559
a chinese brand and i think it's a

1570.64 --> 1575.3600000000001
really good one

1572.559 --> 1577.84
if yeah if you actually know what to

1575.36 --> 1577.84
look for

1578.0 --> 1582.559
but

1579.36 --> 1585.6789999999999
why can't the public do that

1582.559 --> 1586.6399999999999
and just say oh oh your old

1585.679 --> 1589.1200000000001
thing

1586.64 --> 1591.039
that you don't want us to use anymore so

1589.12 --> 1593.36
you downgrade it

1591.039 --> 1595.2
to basically mimic like it's broken so

1593.36 --> 1598.08
we'll buy the new [ __ ]

1595.2 --> 1601.52
what if we just hack that old system and

1598.08 --> 1603.84
say hey company go [ __ ] yourself

1601.52 --> 1606.08
we're just gonna use your technology for

1603.84 --> 1609.52
what it really is

1606.08 --> 1612.96
and you can go and yeah

1609.52 --> 1615.36
run your slave factories and

1612.96 --> 1617.919
keep on trying to push people to buy

1615.36 --> 1620.32
more more more more and we'll just use

1617.919 --> 1623.1200000000001
that device for what it really is

1620.32 --> 1625.4399999999998
independently i'm really looking forward

1623.12 --> 1626.559
oh samsung and south korea

1625.44 --> 1629.3600000000001
oh

1626.559 --> 1629.36
oh huh

1629.52 --> 1634.1589999999999
well it's

1631.36 --> 1636.32
oh it's it's to the east

1634.159 --> 1638.7990000000002
it was almost right

1636.32 --> 1640.96
right samsung is south korea all right

1638.799 --> 1644.6399999999999
didn't know that

1640.96 --> 1644.64
i really like samsung as it ran

1645.36 --> 1650.9599999999998
i got it

1647.2 --> 1653.1200000000001
i had a monitor from samsung i have my

1650.96 --> 1654.48
ssd disks

1653.12 --> 1657.279

and my washing machine is from samsung

1657.279 --> 1660.32
i've really yeah i like the brand i

1659.2 --> 1662.0

1660.32 --> 1664.0
of chinese but i guess they're south

1662.0 --> 1665.76
korean cool

1664.0 --> 1668.96

1973.76 --> 1978.24
i'm getting to the point now that at

1975.6 --> 1979.84
least in this in this specific period

1978.24 --> 1984.08
for some reason

1979.84 --> 1988.6399999999999
dirt seems the answer to everything

1984.08 --> 1991.6399999999999
it works against nervousness anxiety

1988.64 --> 1991.64
nausea

1992.08 --> 1999.039
against like lack of concentration

1995.84 --> 2002.32
dirt guys dirt it's dirt

1999.039 --> 2004.1589999999999
it works so well it's crazy like

2002.32 --> 2005.6789999999999
yesterday night i was like oh man it's

2004.159 --> 2008.7990000000002
kind of late

2005.679 --> 2010.64
oh i got i got like all

2008.799 --> 2013.36
phil's stomach is kind of raw and all

2010.64 --> 2016.0800000000002
that oh let's get some dirt and bang

2013.36 --> 2019.76
it's gone and i slept great

2016.08 --> 2021.6
i had a really good rest this night

2019.76 --> 2023.76
did wake up a little nervous though

2021.6 --> 2025.9189999999999
because i was gonna have to arrange like

2023.76 --> 2029.6
the washing machine thing and

2025.919 --> 2029.6000000000001
didn't know how that was gonna end up

2029.679 --> 2033.8400000000001
but yeah dirt it's great

2035.919 --> 2040.039
it fixes everything

2057.119 --> 2061.839
anyway let's see if i've been doing

2078.56 --> 2082.639
hmm

2079.44 --> 2082.639
what have i been doing

2083.04 --> 2089.839
oh yeah i think i've been playing games

2085.2 --> 2089.839
and kind of watching infowars again

2114.4 --> 2119.119
ah okay thanks for link slow mo moon

2116.72 --> 2119.1189999999997
buggy

2124.96 --> 2129.52
hmm

2126.48 --> 2133.079
this is a new channel

2129.52 --> 2133.079
looks pretty cool

2152.64 --> 2157.44
five months six months

2155.44 --> 2159.599
nine

2157.44 --> 2161.44
all right so they have been added for a

2159.599 --> 2164.1600000000003
while

2161.44 --> 2165.04
a year old huh

2164.16 --> 2167.92
cool

2165.04 --> 2171.56
looks interesting

2167.92 --> 2171.56
it's a bear conversation

2189.119 --> 2195.32
have i thought about it title for

2190.8 --> 2195.32
today's show no not really

2241.839 --> 2243.92
you

2256.62 --> 2259.8599999999997
[Music]

2263.359 --> 2267.7599999999998
oh by the way i s

2265.44 --> 2271.28
just a bit of psychoanalysis media

2267.76 --> 2274.7200000000003
analysis with alex jones right

2271.28 --> 2278.2400000000002
because i think overall alex jones is

2274.72 --> 2280.56
doing pretty decent things like he does

2278.24 --> 2282.3999999999996
kind of like try to explore a bit of

2280.56 --> 2284.32
extra dimensional thinking and spirit

2282.4 --> 2286.7200000000003
mechanics

2284.32 --> 2288.56
but then at the same time he likes to

2286.72 --> 2291.4399999999996
fade in

2288.56 --> 2294.48
that old glover lore

2291.44 --> 2296.839
he can't help himself he has to do it

2294.48 --> 2298.88
he has to make like comparison

2296.839 --> 2301.52
to like

2298.88 --> 2304.32
giants yeah this is the great song it's

2301.52 --> 2306.8
a giant ball of fire

2304.32 --> 2309.839
it can't help himself he has to insert

2306.8 --> 2313.52
that every now and then it's so funny

2309.839 --> 2317.599
i really wonder if he's even

2313.52 --> 2320.88
if he's even like in the want to do that

2317.599 --> 2322.96
or that he is kind of like obligated

2320.88 --> 2327.079
through nasa because i'm pretty damn

2322.96 --> 2327.079
sure he has connections there

2329.92 --> 2335.359
so is alex jones at this point

2333.2 --> 2337.2799999999997
yeah global yeah that's right

2335.359 --> 2341.04
so is alex jones at this point is he

2337.28 --> 2345.28
just virtue signaling to nasa

2341.04 --> 2345.2799999999997
or does he still really believe all that

2346.88 --> 2349.76
i wonder

2348.72 --> 2351.839
because

2349.76 --> 2353.5200000000004
every time he inserts it it doesn't

2351.839 --> 2355.68
really

2353.52 --> 2357.92
do anything

2355.68 --> 2358.7999999999997
it's always during just moments of kind

2357.92 --> 2360.56
of like

2358.8 --> 2362.5600000000004
being inspired and all that and then he

2360.56 --> 2365.44
asserts it

2362.56 --> 2365.44
the globe lore

2365.76 --> 2372.0
but it doesn't really

2369.599 --> 2374.48
it doesn't like force people to do

2372.0 --> 2376.0
something specifically in relation to

2374.48 --> 2377.599
that

2376.0 --> 2381.28
right

2377.599 --> 2383.44
so gatekeeper yeah but how

2381.28 --> 2386.1600000000003
it seems more like virtue signaling than

2383.44 --> 2386.16
gatekeeping

2394.24 --> 2400.3199999999997
oh jones admitted to having tyson oh my

2397.359 --> 2402.56
god yeah i know that's why i'm saying

2400.32 --> 2402.56
that

2407.119 --> 2411.56
his grandfather what

2418.72 --> 2423.48
so now he's a chill

2425.52 --> 2430.96
okay well if you can

2428.079 --> 2433.6800000000003
figure out how that works

2430.96 --> 2437.56
like a chill for what

2433.68 --> 2437.56
what is he chilling for

2440.079 --> 2445.52
i mean he seems to be

2443.2 --> 2448.7999999999997
he is still like very much trying to

2445.52 --> 2450.48
like revive republican system to make it

2448.8 --> 2453.3590000000004
into some kind of a legitimate

2450.48 --> 2455.04
opposition when it is blatantly turning

2453.359 --> 2456.56
into a

2455.04 --> 2458.72
controlled

2456.56 --> 2461.2
cockposition

2458.72 --> 2464.24
it's just controlled [ __ ] opposition

2461.2 --> 2464.24
that basically

2464.319 --> 2471.599
yeah let's the left do whatever the [ __ ]

2467.44 --> 2473.599
they want and just complain about it

2471.599 --> 2476.1600000000003
don't actually do anything against it

2473.599 --> 2478.7200000000003
don't vote against it

2476.16 --> 2480.96
that's really the bigger problem

2478.72 --> 2485.5989999999997
it

2480.96 --> 2488.319
he's compromised by what by who how

2485.599 --> 2490.48
so what tico is speaking like you don't

2488.319 --> 2492.319
know unless you could actually

2490.48 --> 2494.72
write it down

2492.319 --> 2498.319
like how

2494.72 --> 2499.68
he's a shield he's a compromise how

2498.319 --> 2502.0
how

2499.68 --> 2504.3999999999996
lay it down

2502.0 --> 2505.92
or realize that you don't actually

2504.4 --> 2508.1600000000003
really know what you're talking about

2505.92 --> 2510.48
it's just a suspicion

2508.16 --> 2513.839
a suspicion that's very likely to have

2510.48 --> 2518.2400000000002
some legitimacy to it but if you don't

2513.839 --> 2518.24
understand how you're just blabbering

2521.599 --> 2525.839
right and i've been studying alex jones

2524.16 --> 2528.0
for a long time

2525.839 --> 2529.599
i pay careful attention to what he's

2528.0 --> 2532.48
like what he's doing

2529.599 --> 2532.48
how he feels

2534.24 --> 2538.319
because there's a lot of detail in his

2536.56 --> 2542.7599999999998
communication

2538.319 --> 2542.7599999999998
a lot of personal reflection detail

2560.4 --> 2565.839
yeah miss grace yet i don't believe you

2562.64 --> 2565.839
this is stupid rumor

2602.0 --> 2607.359
right well classical homeopath thank you

2604.64 --> 2609.44
see now now we have a list

2607.359 --> 2614.04
now you actually got something right

2609.44 --> 2614.04
yeah and he has issues with all of that

2620.96 --> 2626.56
but like at least he's like addressing

2623.68 --> 2629.52
the trump issue he's actually addressed

2626.56 --> 2631.2
trump effectively being a shill

2629.52 --> 2633.839
for big pharma he's

2631.2 --> 2635.68
addressed that

2633.839 --> 2637.44
and he's kind of pushing on that like

2635.68 --> 2640.0
you got his you got to stop it you got

2637.44 --> 2640.0
to stop it

2642.319 --> 2647.319
and he doesn't seem to be stopping it

2644.319 --> 2647.319
really

2648.48 --> 2654.56
right so yeah there's issues

2652.319 --> 2656.079
with trump you could very much see it

2654.56 --> 2658.72
coming like

2656.079 --> 2661.52
i saw that [ __ ] coming

2658.72 --> 2663.04
two three years ago

2661.52 --> 2665.599
like he's all

2663.04 --> 2667.68
like putting all in all behind trump

2665.599 --> 2669.2000000000003
trump is the savior even though he would

2667.68 --> 2671.44
always be like oh yeah i'm not gonna say

2669.2 --> 2673.2
that but he effectively would act like

2671.44 --> 2674.7200000000003
that

2673.2 --> 2677.4399999999996
and now

2674.72 --> 2680.56
yeah the things the situation has turned

2677.44 --> 2682.88
and he's been just facts shilling

2680.56 --> 2684.96
in the last year

2682.88 --> 2685.839
and now alex has to recognize like yeah

2684.96 --> 2689.119
that's

2685.839 --> 2691.359
crossing a line you can't cross

2689.119 --> 2692.319
not without consequences

2691.359 --> 2696.319
so

2692.319 --> 2699.7599999999998
he's not like a full-on trump political

2696.319 --> 2701.2799999999997
shill that's like pro-trump what forever

2699.76 --> 2703.599
right

2701.28 --> 2705.119
he's pushing it agenda oh yeah where's

2703.599 --> 2707.3590000000004
your evidence then

2705.119 --> 2707.359
huh

2710.0 --> 2715.28
yeah wow notice the difference between 2

2712.8 --> 2717.3590000000004
000 jones and 20 20 jails yeah yeah you

2715.28 --> 2719.92
know what a big difference is

2717.359 --> 2722.4
he's 20 years older

2719.92 --> 2724.48
what do you want

2722.4 --> 2727.6800000000003
people change a lot in 20 years

2724.48 --> 2729.44
especially if you're like on media

2727.68 --> 2732.3999999999996
non-stop

2729.44 --> 2734.64
that's what happens you change

2732.4 --> 2739.2000000000003
i've changed in like the time span of

2734.64 --> 2739.2
five years pretty dramatically in ways

2742.4 --> 2747.839
maybe he got so offended needs to lose

2744.48 --> 2747.839
yeah that's that's right

2748.319 --> 2752.64
well in my own right so am i

2753.04 --> 2756.88
it's actually what i kind of liked about

2754.96 --> 2758.079
alex jones

2756.88 --> 2760.1600000000003
that he just

2758.079 --> 2763.2000000000003
explodes sometimes and they did this

2760.16 --> 2766.48
like yeah screw political correctness

2763.2 --> 2770.0
screw media training screw ruffling

2766.48 --> 2772.56
feathers that don't need to be ruffled

2770.0 --> 2774.72
i'm just gonna say this right now

2772.56 --> 2778.24
because i really think that's true and i

2774.72 --> 2780.0
i kind of appreciated that about him

2778.24 --> 2781.2
he's been

2780.0 --> 2782.56
decently

2781.2 --> 2784.0
persistent

2782.56 --> 2786.4
doing that

2784.0 --> 2789.28
it's his schtick sometimes he tries to

2786.4 --> 2791.6800000000003
like almost artificially hype himself up

2789.28 --> 2793.8390000000004
i think

2791.68 --> 2796.48
and that's kind of annoying because then

2793.839 --> 2798.319
it's like dude you're acting it's like

2796.48 --> 2799.119
yeah you have some feelings to that but

2798.319 --> 2802.079
you're

2799.119 --> 2804.56
blatantly obviously hyping it up extra

2802.079 --> 2806.5600000000004
to be more dramatic and while you're

2804.56 --> 2810.16
saying i'm not trying to be dramatic yes

2806.56 --> 2813.2799999999997
you are like alex jones sometimes just

2810.16 --> 2815.2
lies straight to your face

2813.28 --> 2817.2000000000003
and he believes it

2815.2 --> 2821.1189999999997
right that's the issue he lies straight

2817.2 --> 2824.319
to your face but he believes it's true

2821.119 --> 2826.1600000000003
that's what he does sometimes

2824.319 --> 2827.92
it's called doubling down

2826.16 --> 2830.16
he does that too

2827.92 --> 2833.92
right so he's no by no means perfect but

2830.16 --> 2833.92
i still think he's very interesting and

2837.92 --> 2841.119
yeah

2839.68 --> 2843.359
and he can

2841.119 --> 2846.88
be very informative and he surrounds

2843.359 --> 2847.7599999999998
himself by people that are informative

2846.88 --> 2851.48
so

2847.76 --> 2851.48
i'm just going to keep watching

2862.88 --> 2866.4
anyway

2864.16 --> 2866.3999999999996
yeah

2868.319 --> 2871.96
it is what it is

2878.88 --> 2882.8
ah jones in waking life yeah yeah

2884.88 --> 2889.839
he's done amazing stuff

2887.599 --> 2892.079
i still think that like some of his all

2889.839 --> 2893.2799999999997
the documentaries like

2892.079 --> 2896.48
end game

2893.28 --> 2898.48
they're really good

2896.48 --> 2902.079
and they were like at the time they were

2898.48 --> 2904.64
like ah this is fair porn it's too much

2902.079 --> 2906.48
but it's true though

2904.64 --> 2908.72
you know

2906.48 --> 2912.16
and that's kind of like

2908.72 --> 2915.04
getting more obvious right now that yeah

2912.16 --> 2917.1189999999997
it was like too much back then but it

2915.04 --> 2922.599
was true

2917.119 --> 2922.599
it really was we're seeing it right now

2928.96 --> 2933.44
do my thing i do i do what i do

2934.64 --> 2938.44
i will do my thing

2955.52 --> 2961.2
so yeah but anybody who wants to say oh

2958.48 --> 2963.359
he's a gatekeeper he's a shoe he's

2961.2 --> 2965.4399999999996
pushing a paid agenda could you lay that

2963.359 --> 2966.48
out exactly

2965.44 --> 2968.559
like

2966.48 --> 2971.839
what's the agenda

2968.559 --> 2971.8390000000004
and who's paying him

2972.64 --> 2981.52
for that specifically right because he

2976.319 --> 2981.52
does try to draw in advertisement and

2981.599 --> 2986.4
sells products as we all know by now

2984.319 --> 2988.4
right constantly getting bombarded with

2986.4 --> 2991.599
that

2988.4 --> 2991.599
he's doing a business

2992.24 --> 2996.839
but yeah if he's pushing a paid agenda

2995.68 --> 2999.2
i'd like to

2996.839 --> 3002.0789999999997
know what

2999.2 --> 3003.839
paid agenda and who's paying him where's

3002.079 --> 3007.52
your evidence right

3003.839 --> 3010.16
because blind accusations

3007.52 --> 3012.24
even though it's already widely echoed

3010.16 --> 3015.2
and

3012.24 --> 3018.5989999999997
it's just annoying right it's still just

3015.2 --> 3018.5989999999997
kind of rumors

3026.24 --> 3030.16
say time warner all right yeah yeah time

3028.319 --> 3031.68
worn yeah it's done business with them

3030.16 --> 3033.7599999999998
so

3031.68 --> 3037.2
how

3033.76 --> 3040.6400000000003
did they pay him

3037.2 --> 3043.4399999999996
for an agenda and what agenda is that

3040.64 --> 3045.2
what's time warner's agenda that he is

3043.44 --> 3047.839
enacting right now

3045.2 --> 3049.1189999999997
yeah can you actually put the dots

3047.839 --> 3050.96
together

3049.119 --> 3054.599
or you didn't really think about it that

3050.96 --> 3054.599
far ahead of time

3067.93 --> 3073.0989999999997
[Music]

3075.2 --> 3078.319
right

3076.0 --> 3080.559
i mean have you ever even thought about

3078.319 --> 3082.8
that that maybe if you're going to

3080.559 --> 3084.7200000000003
accuse somebody

3082.8 --> 3087.92
you might want to actually have the

3084.72 --> 3091.52
evidence not just he did business

3087.92 --> 3096.319
with that person or that group or that

3091.52 --> 3098.8
company like you might want to actually

3096.319 --> 3098.8
you know

3098.96 --> 3104.079
make a logical connection not just a

3101.52 --> 3106.079
blind accusation and say everybody's

3104.079 --> 3109.04
corrupted everybody's into it that's

3106.079 --> 3111.8390000000004
which is just paranoid nonsense

3109.04 --> 3111.839
that's not proof

3116.16 --> 3121.359
it is a hoax aj says it is from wuhan

3119.2 --> 3124.72
well that's the narrative

3121.359 --> 3127.7599999999998
that's the counter narrative that's

3124.72 --> 3130.319
what is said does that mean

3127.76 --> 3132.559
that that's literal

3130.319 --> 3134.8
i'm pretty sure that alex does realize

3132.559 --> 3134.8
that

3135.119 --> 3140.88
the whole thing is pure mind control and

3137.28 --> 3143.92
that it's nothing but at the same time

3140.88 --> 3146.6400000000003
they need a story you see

3143.92 --> 3148.88
this is politics

3146.64 --> 3150.48
there needs to be a response

3148.88 --> 3153.2000000000003
wuhan

3150.48 --> 3154.079
the lab leaks supposedly

3153.2 --> 3157.4399999999996
that's

3154.079 --> 3160.319
an angle of approach to eventually

3157.44 --> 3161.119
resolve the situation that's how they

3160.319 --> 3163.44
get

3161.119 --> 3166.7200000000003
to the politicians and that's how they

3163.44 --> 3171.599
follow the money trail see does it mean

3166.72 --> 3173.839
that the virus has to be a real thing

3171.599 --> 3178.1600000000003
but they do need

3173.839 --> 3180.7999999999997
a story some kind of a hook in order to

3178.16 --> 3182.96
resolve the situation eventually don't

3180.8 --> 3184.96
you understand that

3182.96 --> 3188.079
don't you get that

3184.96 --> 3188.079
that that's what it's for

3191.68 --> 3195.52
right they need to funny follow a money

3194.079 --> 3198.0
trail and if they're just gonna say yeah

3195.52 --> 3199.44
it's all fake it's all made up then what

3198.0 --> 3200.559
are you gonna follow

3199.44 --> 3202.48
nothing

3200.559 --> 3203.599
you're just gonna follow a stage play or

3202.48 --> 3206.559
something

3203.599 --> 3206.559
that doesn't work

3206.8 --> 3210.88
right so they're gonna go with the

3208.96 --> 3212.7200000000003
assumption that it's real which is how

3210.88 --> 3214.48
it's all written down

3212.72 --> 3217.359
and then follow that money trill and

3214.48 --> 3219.359
then you get to one lab and yeah that's

3217.359 --> 3220.839
their angle of approach that's how they

3219.359 --> 3222.5589999999997
want to resolve it

3220.839 --> 3225.19
eventually

3222.559 --> 3228.329
don't you understand

3225.19 --> 3228.329
[Music]

3253.68 --> 3258.5589999999997
please watch the show with david duke

3257.2 --> 3261.5589999999997
uh

3258.559 --> 3261.559
what

3265.92 --> 3271.7200000000003
do i really have to

3267.839 --> 3271.72
how long is that to go

3282.4 --> 3285.4
so

3296.88 --> 3299.52
right

3297.68 --> 3301.2
but the whole

3299.52 --> 3303.359
wuhan lab

3301.2 --> 3305.2
from china

3303.359 --> 3308.16
that's

3305.2 --> 3310.16
the cover story that has legal

3308.16 --> 3312.5589999999997
implications right that's what it's

3310.16 --> 3312.5589999999997
about

3314.079 --> 3318.4
and if you would

3315.839 --> 3321.04
in that attempt say but it's all not

3318.4 --> 3324.079
real nothing ever happened

3321.04 --> 3326.88
then you don't have a trail you see

3324.079 --> 3329.92
do you understand now

3326.88 --> 3329.92
that's what it's for

3332.799 --> 3339.28
i'm pretty decently sure that

3336.079 --> 3341.28
alex jones realizes that viruses don't

3339.28 --> 3344.1600000000003
work

3341.28 --> 3346.4
as is generally being portrayed

3344.16 --> 3349.04
i think he does know

3346.4 --> 3350.4
he just doesn't really know how to deal

3349.04 --> 3353.2799999999997
with that

3350.4 --> 3355.04
can't really lay down his own version of

3353.28 --> 3357.6800000000003
explanation for it

3355.04 --> 3359.04
but he's already conceded that yeah it

3357.68 --> 3362.48
seems that

3359.04 --> 3364.72
the real effect the real viral effect is

3362.48 --> 3369.119
mental mostly

3364.72 --> 3371.52
that the virus spreads through the mind

3369.119 --> 3374.2400000000002
rather than through physical contact i'm

3371.52 --> 3376.48
pretty sure he he knows about that

3374.24 --> 3377.839
but at the same time he's still trying

3376.48 --> 3380.2400000000002
to

3377.839 --> 3383.7599999999998
kind of reinforce

3380.24 --> 3385.2
the viral concept the concept of a virus

3383.76 --> 3387.28
as a thing

3385.2 --> 3391.2
so he's kind of like

3387.28 --> 3392.2400000000002
in a in a duality situation there where

3391.2 --> 3394.48
he's

3392.24 --> 3396.4799999999996
on one hand

3394.48 --> 3398.0
he acts like it's all real

3396.48 --> 3399.92
and super dangerous and on the other

3398.0 --> 3402.839
hand he does realize like yeah it's

3399.92 --> 3404.4
mostly kind of mental and people

3402.839 --> 3406.96
just

3404.4 --> 3408.079
make themselves sick by believing it so

3406.96 --> 3410.7200000000003
much

3408.079 --> 3412.559
right and those two don't really work

3410.72 --> 3415.1189999999997
together all that well

3412.559 --> 3416.96
right it's actually once you see one

3415.119 --> 3419.6800000000003
then you kind of realize that the other

3416.96 --> 3421.119
has to be

3419.68 --> 3423.04
fake

3421.119 --> 3425.2000000000003
a cover story

3423.04 --> 3428.0
so i think he does know it just doesn't

3425.2 --> 3428.0
really matter

3430.16 --> 3434.24
because there will be people out there

3432.079 --> 3437.28
believing it and if you just say no it's

3434.24 --> 3440.8799999999997
all fake then you'll lose the attention

3437.28 --> 3440.88
of those people entirely

3441.599 --> 3446.28
i think that's the strategy behind it

3458.96 --> 3464.559
hey starting 8012 how are you doing

3461.92 --> 3464.559
good to see you

3464.96 --> 3469.7200000000003
hmm

3466.319 --> 3469.72
man i'm hungry

3475.599 --> 3478.599
huh

3491.44 --> 3494.599
all right

3508.88 --> 3511.88
so

3530.64 --> 3532.96
hmm

3538.4 --> 3542.319
oh by the way i have people yeah you

3540.079 --> 3545.119
guys must have noticed

3542.319 --> 3548.24
there's that guy again

3545.119 --> 3548.2400000000002
this guy that keeps on

3549.04 --> 3554.16
making these speeches

3551.28 --> 3559.079
in the european parliament

3554.16 --> 3559.0789999999997
is he from croatia or something

3559.28 --> 3564.559
he's like

3560.559 --> 3564.559
doing amazing work i think

3565.44 --> 3569.28
it's the best thing that happened to the

3566.88 --> 3572.28
european parliament since

3569.28 --> 3572.28
farage

3592.4 --> 3595.92
let's see if i can find a name

3598.48 --> 3601.839
oh yeah croatian

3606.4 --> 3610.1600000000003
mislav

3608.0 --> 3611.92
kolokuzik

3610.16 --> 3615.839
kolakuzik

3611.92 --> 3615.839
yeah pretty epic stuff

3633.04 --> 3639.2799999999997
has the price of natural gas come up and

3636.24 --> 3643.0789999999997
i don't know i don't

3639.28 --> 3643.079
i don't get the bill

3653.359 --> 3657.7599999999998
right but i think that

3655.76 --> 3661.44
europe's in a bit of a different package

3657.76 --> 3664.7200000000003
compared to america where america

3661.44 --> 3667.76
the federal government is literally

3664.72 --> 3669.9199999999996
literally just turning off provisions

3667.76 --> 3671.92
and that's going to drive up prices like

3669.92 --> 3674.799
crazy

3671.92 --> 3676.799
like they're just turning it off

3674.799 --> 3679.44
like that's it's not happening like that

3676.799 --> 3679.44
over here

3680.24 --> 3683.5989999999997
i mean

3681.2 --> 3685.9199999999996
there's like the interruption of the the

3683.599 --> 3688.079
gastrum

3685.92 --> 3690.0
the giant gas pipeline from russia and

3688.079 --> 3690.799
all that there's a lot of hassle with

3690.0 --> 3692.96
that

3690.799 --> 3695.92
but

3692.96 --> 3699.839
that's not like directly hitting us all

3695.92 --> 3699.839
instantly just yet

3704.72 --> 3709.52
but then again i haven't like literally

3706.88 --> 3713.839
checked the prices of it here in my

3709.52 --> 3713.839
country because i'm not involved so

3727.119 --> 3733.6800000000003
hmm okay starting 8012 glad to hear that

3731.68 --> 3735.1189999999997
listening to my opinion and

3733.68 --> 3736.48
yeah

3735.119 --> 3739.039
so you become

3736.48 --> 3742.48
split up in that yeah

3739.039 --> 3744.3190000000004
well that's where i'm at too

3742.48 --> 3747.2
although i'm pretty sure that it the

3744.319 --> 3748.64
original cover story for viruses is

3747.2 --> 3751.64
completely

3748.64 --> 3751.64
fictional

3754.72 --> 3756.9599999999996
right

3757.68 --> 3762.319
but yeah you can still

3759.92 --> 3765.2000000000003
carry it carry both and just compare it

3762.319 --> 3767.68
keep comparing right one approach and

3765.2 --> 3770.16
then the official story approach or

3767.68 --> 3772.0789999999997
sub official story because they always

3770.16 --> 3775.2
overblow everything

3772.079 --> 3775.2000000000003
beyond necessity

3775.359 --> 3778.799
but still assuming viruses are real and

3777.359 --> 3781.68
how that's supposed to work and then

3778.799 --> 3783.7599999999998
comparing it to the other approach

3781.68 --> 3787.44
and i'm pretty sure that over time you

3783.76 --> 3791.76
will just start to realize that

3787.44 --> 3791.76
it really was just like a cover story

3791.839 --> 3795.52
it's not how it really works

3793.839 --> 3797.599
like you can't

3795.52 --> 3800.799
infect somebody

3797.599 --> 3802.799
by particle exposure of these supposed

3800.799 --> 3807.4
viruses it doesn't

3802.799 --> 3807.4
do anything doesn't work

3810.24 --> 3815.68
right and that's like the entire core

3812.319 --> 3817.92
foundation is exposure you get exposure

3815.68 --> 3819.52
and then they invade yeah well that

3817.92 --> 3822.079
doesn't happen

3819.52 --> 3825.839
it just doesn't that's not how it works

3822.079 --> 3825.8390000000004
it's not what's going on

3837.44 --> 3841.359
and at the same time i'm also pretty

3839.44 --> 3843.2000000000003
sure that even if you have like two

3841.359 --> 3846.0
people one is

3843.2 --> 3848.48
clearly in an infectious stage as they

3846.0 --> 3851.68
would call it of a virus or a cold or

3848.48 --> 3853.92
something and there's a giant thick but

3851.68 --> 3855.0389999999998
transparent plastic wall in between

3853.92 --> 3857.92
there

3855.039 --> 3860.7990000000004
with microphones to relay sound

3857.92 --> 3861.599
but absolutely no physical contact

3860.799 --> 3865.2
that

3861.599 --> 3868.4
yeah by being in contact with each other

3865.2 --> 3870.16
and the one being sick like not

3868.4 --> 3873.599
not holding back just sneezing and

3870.16 --> 3877.7599999999998
coughing all the time very visible and

3873.599 --> 3879.3590000000004
getting snot on the pla on the window

3877.76 --> 3881.3590000000004
that can

3879.359 --> 3883.7599999999998
technically cause the other to have a

3881.359 --> 3886.0
psychosomatic reaction

3883.76 --> 3888.48
and then get it too

3886.0 --> 3891.039
right without any physical contact

3888.48 --> 3893.359
whatsoever

3891.039 --> 3896.48
right so you put that

3893.359 --> 3898.24
next to the fact that you can simply be

3896.48 --> 3900.64
physically exposed

3898.24 --> 3902.24
and not get it at all not even a trace

3900.64 --> 3903.359
nothing

3902.24 --> 3906.839
no

3903.359 --> 3910.5589999999997
resolve of the body no adaptation

3906.839 --> 3913.0389999999998
or our immune system took it and adapted

3910.559 --> 3916.1600000000003
and it's evolved like we got the the

3913.039 --> 3918.6400000000003
immuno stuff for it now

3916.16 --> 3918.64
like no

3919.039 --> 3925.3590000000004
just exposure and nothing

3922.4 --> 3927.92
absolutely nothing and then you have

3925.359 --> 3931.2799999999997
psychosomatic exposure with absolutely

3927.92 --> 3933.28
no physical contact

3931.28 --> 3934.799
and then you can still just get it you

3933.28 --> 3937.44
just start

3934.799 --> 3938.64
having that out of nothing

3937.44 --> 3939.359
right

3938.64 --> 3942.72
so

3939.359 --> 3945.2799999999997
the entire original virus model and

3942.72 --> 3948.0789999999997
physical exposure to these supposed

3945.28 --> 3951.119
virus particles is just

3948.079 --> 3953.599
totally and utterly disproven and

3951.119 --> 3955.28
outdated it just doesn't work like that

3953.599 --> 3957.92
it never did

3955.28 --> 3961.28
it's a science fiction story to suggest

3957.92 --> 3961.28
that it does work like that

3963.28 --> 3968.559
not psychosomatic but a real energetic

3965.76 --> 3971.119
transfer sure

3968.559 --> 3974.1600000000003
is what's the difference

3971.119 --> 3977.28
energy transfer psychosomatics isn't

3974.16 --> 3979.0389999999998
that kind of what that is

3977.28 --> 3982.0
you resonate

3979.039 --> 3983.119
you attune your energy to that of the

3982.0 --> 3984.799
other

3983.119 --> 3987.2000000000003
by some

3984.799 --> 3989.359
like instinctual

3987.2 --> 3992.3999999999996
biological process

3989.359 --> 3994.799
yeah you could say energy transfer it's

3992.4 --> 3996.96
not very different psychosomatics and

3994.799 --> 4000.359
energy transfer are not all that

3996.96 --> 4000.359
different really

4010.0 --> 4013.0
oh

4023.52 --> 4026.52
psychoseismatics

4032.72 --> 4038.319
that's funny psychosomatics would be

4036.48 --> 4040.4
seismatics

4038.319 --> 4043.2
would be what happens when somebody gets

4040.4 --> 4046.319
like really really pissed off and then

4043.2 --> 4048.24
the shock waves that psychologically

4046.319 --> 4052.0389999999998
come forth from that that could be

4048.24 --> 4052.0389999999998
considered psychoseismatics

4055.2 --> 4062.5989999999997
if the placebo effect can cure people

4058.16 --> 4062.5989999999997
we also have the opposite of it yes

4062.96 --> 4068.799
it's all about the attitude

4066.24 --> 4071.359
it's all about your intention

4068.799 --> 4075.48
what you accept as your reality what you

4071.359 --> 4075.48
invite in as your reality

4076.799 --> 4080.44
and your body adapts

4093.599 --> 4098.0
right yes starting 80 12 well i'm

4095.839 --> 4100.239
hearing those types of stories all over

4098.0 --> 4102.239
the place adam meekin had a story like

4100.239 --> 4103.199
that his family was all sick he wasn't

4102.239 --> 4106.3189999999995
sick

4103.199 --> 4106.3189999999995
i hear it all the time

4106.4 --> 4110.96
like when i was what is it eight

4109.679 --> 4112.719
something

4110.96 --> 4114.2390000000005
there was like this sickness going

4112.719 --> 4117.04
around

4114.239 --> 4120.0
it was a flu it was pretty bad and like

4117.04 --> 4121.359
everybody got really sick

4120.0 --> 4124.0
and

4121.359 --> 4124.0
i didn't

4125.199 --> 4130.799
i just didn't but i did was drenched in

4128.239 --> 4133.678999999999
the feeling of sickness from the people

4130.799 --> 4135.92
around me though so i felt kind of like

4133.679 --> 4137.759
not good i was worried

4135.92 --> 4140.2390000000005
i was afraid that

4137.759 --> 4141.52
my loved ones would die my parents and

4140.239 --> 4144.4
my grandma

4141.52 --> 4146.319
because they were all there

4144.4 --> 4149.2789999999995
but

4146.319 --> 4152.2390000000005
i didn't get sick

4149.279 --> 4154.64
even though i was like among them among

4152.239 --> 4156.959999999999
several sick people we almost had like

4154.64 --> 4158.839
our uh turned our house into sort of a

4156.96 --> 4161.6
makeshift

4158.839 --> 4163.6
hospital sort of

4161.6 --> 4165.52
because we had multiple people that were

4163.6 --> 4167.6
sick in the area

4165.52 --> 4169.759
in our house we just like we were

4167.6 --> 4172.400000000001
available for that

4169.759 --> 4176.96
yeah pretty nice

4172.4 --> 4176.96
but i didn't get sick i just didn't

4177.359 --> 4182.2390000000005
now in other occasions

4179.6 --> 4185.4400000000005
not that one i would get sick and then i

4182.239 --> 4187.759
would get like really heavy flu and [ __ ]

4185.44 --> 4190.159
and i would be the only one

4187.759 --> 4192.56
and then my parents wouldn't get it

4190.159 --> 4192.5599999999995
at all

4197.36 --> 4204.08
so you can never really tell

4200.32 --> 4204.08
it's not just a simple

4204.32 --> 4207.12
one plus one is two

4206.08 --> 4209.12
system

4207.12 --> 4211.76
it's not like oh you

4209.12 --> 4214.159
are in contact with somebody that has it

4211.76 --> 4216.8
now you're gonna get it

4214.159 --> 4219.36
or even

4216.8 --> 4223.52
develop immunity to it like this idea of

4219.36 --> 4225.679
developing immunity is almost

4223.52 --> 4227.120000000001
out of place because do you develop

4225.679 --> 4229.76
immunity or

4227.12 --> 4232.239
is it rather you just go through the

4229.76 --> 4234.56
process and you're done

4232.239 --> 4236.879999999999
do you actually have immunity or are you

4234.56 --> 4238.56
just done for that time period

4236.88 --> 4241.1990000000005
like it's not gonna trigger again

4238.56 --> 4243.6
because it's all resolved

4241.199 --> 4246.239
it's all cleaned up so you will not

4243.6 --> 4249.6
trigger is that immunity

4246.239 --> 4251.44
immunity almost immediately implies an

4249.6 --> 4253.280000000001
infection

4251.44 --> 4255.599999999999
is it

4253.28 --> 4258.719
or did your body just go through that

4255.6 --> 4261.719
process so you don't get it for a while

4258.719 --> 4261.719
see

4290.719 --> 4292.96
hmm

4298.0 --> 4303.28
all right started 80 12. we're glad that

4300.719 --> 4303.28
you're not

4303.52 --> 4308.280000000001
that you're not having any problems so

4305.28 --> 4308.28
far

4310.5 --> 4313.88
[Music]

4316.85 --> 4321.59
[Music]

4321.92 --> 4324.92
so

4357.44 --> 4361.15
all right i'm gonna take another two

4358.88 --> 4364.2
minute break be right back

4361.15 --> 4364.2
[Music]

4451.44 --> 4454.44
what

4465.04 --> 4468.04
hmm

4480.719 --> 4483.92
psycho cymatics

4487.199 --> 4492.32
it's trying to lift things with your

4489.199 --> 4492.32
insane screaming

4494.8 --> 4498.56
it's not going to be good for your ears

4505.04 --> 4508.88
which type of energy source has the best

4507.12 --> 4511.84
potential of powering the world in the

4508.88 --> 4511.84
future

4512.88 --> 4515.4400000000005
all of it

4520.32 --> 4523.96
in its own way

4526.08 --> 4530.159
right the entire idea is how do you

4528.96 --> 4532.4800000000005
overcome

4530.159 --> 4534.5599999999995
the energy loss every time

4532.48 --> 4536.879999999999
keeping things local and depending on

4534.56 --> 4540.080000000001
the situation

4536.88 --> 4543.1990000000005
yeah solar works great for certain

4540.08 --> 4545.28
places and then not great for others and

4543.199 --> 4548.08
wind

4545.28 --> 4550.159
it's the same thing

4548.08 --> 4552.8
and i think that

4550.159 --> 4554.0
the fossil fuels

4552.8 --> 4555.04
i think

4554.0 --> 4557.36
oil

4555.04 --> 4560.159
based fuels and all that

4557.36 --> 4562.159
still have like a really important role

4560.159 --> 4566.36
and they're going to keep that role

4562.159 --> 4566.36
because it's so effective

4570.32 --> 4573.679
so

4571.12 --> 4577.12
yeah this entire idea oh we have to get

4573.679 --> 4579.84
rid of the old things

4577.12 --> 4581.679
make way for new environmentally

4579.84 --> 4583.6
friendly things it's all [ __ ]

4581.679 --> 4585.36
because that doesn't actually work out

4583.6 --> 4587.52
that way

4585.36 --> 4590.32
if you just use everything

4587.52 --> 4592.400000000001
to the maximum efficiency

4590.32 --> 4595.84
and arrange society in a way that there

4592.4 --> 4600.92
is very little energy loss

4595.84 --> 4600.92
then you could use almost all of it

4608.08 --> 4612.08
but i certainly think that nuclear

4610.48 --> 4615.44
has a very

4612.08 --> 4617.5199999999995
core important role for the future

4615.44 --> 4620.48
because it's just so

4617.52 --> 4623.84
good and it can be made so unbelievably

4620.48 --> 4623.839999999999
safe these days

4635.04 --> 4639.199
steam engines

4637.36 --> 4640.88
well steam engines are kind of

4639.199 --> 4644.159
problematic though

4640.88 --> 4646.56
ralph rodriguez because

4644.159 --> 4647.839999999999
they wear out

4646.56 --> 4650.8
right that was always the problem with

4647.84 --> 4653.679
steam engines is that yeah when you

4650.8 --> 4657.04
have hot steam which is water

4653.679 --> 4659.12
it tends to rust

4657.04 --> 4661.84
tends to rust a lot

4659.12 --> 4665.4
so steam engines are not super durable

4661.84 --> 4665.400000000001
for the long run

4669.679 --> 4675.12
unless you somehow manage to create

4672.64 --> 4677.1990000000005
steam engines that are not

4675.12 --> 4680.159
made with steel but with super hard

4677.199 --> 4681.28
plastic engines or something

4680.159 --> 4683.5199999999995
just

4681.28 --> 4686.239
spitballing here who knows maybe that's

4683.52 --> 4689.280000000001
a possibility you could make

4686.239 --> 4692.799999999999
steam plastic engines that literally

4689.28 --> 4694.8
wouldn't wear out

4692.8 --> 4697.76
i don't know man with all the composite

4694.8 --> 4701.8
materials that are being invented these

4697.76 --> 4701.8
days who knows what's possible

4729.04 --> 4733.12
don't you have to consider the fuel that

4730.96 --> 4735.28
is burned to make the steam although it

4733.12 --> 4737.679
depends on

4735.28 --> 4737.679
yeah

4738.0 --> 4741.84
right

4739.52 --> 4741.84
i mean

4742.719 --> 4747.76
steam engines can technically be nuclear

4745.28 --> 4747.759999999999
powered

4752.88 --> 4758.08
pretty sure that most nuclear power

4754.8 --> 4761.159000000001
plants specifically have like steam type

4758.08 --> 4761.159
of turbines

4766.64 --> 4772.08
like so use a mix of fluids with no

4769.12 --> 4773.679
cross effect cool that's interesting

4772.08 --> 4777.08
that's good to know

4773.679 --> 4777.08
george sanford

4805.84 --> 4809.679
microwave propulsion

4814.239 --> 4821.199
that sounds very hazardous

4817.52 --> 4823.679
rodriguez microwave propulsion

4821.199 --> 4825.678999999999
but that's kind of the idea that nasa

4823.679 --> 4828.8
even came up with how they're going to

4825.679 --> 4831.6
propel themselves in space

4828.8 --> 4835.04
for like a microwave pulse generator

4831.6 --> 4835.04
generator apparently

4835.36 --> 4838.639
yeah

4837.04 --> 4842.6
i don't know if that's ever going to be

4838.639 --> 4842.6
effective on earth though

4862.159 --> 4865.199
right

4863.6 --> 4866.96
i think i'm going to run out the show

4865.199 --> 4869.28
though i want to get some lunch and like

4866.96 --> 4872.32
the repair guys for my washing machine

4869.28 --> 4874.239
are going to arrive roughly

4872.32 --> 4875.92
after 15 minutes and i kind of want to

4874.239 --> 4878.4
have lunch in me before that time

4875.92 --> 4880.2390000000005
because i i gotta help them

4878.4 --> 4883.239
carry that washing machine down the

4880.239 --> 4883.239
staircase

4898.719 --> 4904.719
hey service day

4900.48 --> 4904.718999999999
yep that sounds like a baller all right

4905.36 --> 4911.88
that's how f-16s propel them okay

4908.88 --> 4911.88
okay

4920.0 --> 4925.04
right i thought it was something else

4921.92 --> 4929.56
but yeah sure this

4925.04 --> 4929.56
technology it's all technology

4934.8 --> 4939.04
right but i think i'm gonna round out

4936.4 --> 4939.04
the show though

4939.28 --> 4945.28
nice chill chill that stream today yeah

4941.36 --> 4948.239
i hope to uh have that again tomorrow

4945.28 --> 4950.4
so thanks everyone for coming i hope you

4948.239 --> 4952.638999999999
liked this show if you did then please

they'll be much appreciated and still

4971.679 --> 4977.36
needed i still need to support

4975.04 --> 4979.6
this is gonna cost me the repair of my

4977.36 --> 4982.48
washing machine

4979.6 --> 4986.2390000000005
and i still have some minor debts to pay

4982.48 --> 4987.5199999999995

bird number

5007.8 --> 5012.719
1136 on a tuesday and i'm going to join

5010.56 --> 5014.639
the flat earth debates but

5012.719 --> 5015.92
maybe not like the first hour i don't

5014.639 --> 5019.6
know

5015.92 --> 5019.6
but i'll get in there at some point

5020.239 --> 5024.5599999999995

5024.56 --> 5028.639
the chat it's very interesting

5026.4 --> 5031.12
conversations

5028.639 --> 5034.49
and until the next video

5031.12 --> 5047.89
keep it flat

5034.49 --> 5047.889999999999
[Music]

5048.719 --> 5065.77
do

5051.14 --> 5065.77
