right

115.079 --> 118.88
so whether today is

119.399 --> 122.18
Sublime

124.939 --> 131.16
is very clear

129.179 --> 133.02
there's a couple of trails going down

131.16 --> 135.42
but

133.02 --> 137.52
I don't know it's not really blurring

135.42 --> 140.57999999999998
things up too much

137.52 --> 142.68
even yesterday it started to clear up a

140.58 --> 145.09900000000002
little bit more get less clouded and now

142.68 --> 145.09900000000002
it's just

145.379 --> 149.29999999999998
super blue bright

151.319 --> 157.26
and like yeah there's a bit of wind

154.68 --> 159.12
but just yeah with the sun on top of

157.26 --> 164.0
that it's just really beautiful it's

159.12 --> 164.0
just like Beach or picnic weather

164.04 --> 168.239
good stuff

166.26 --> 170.48
very enjoyable oh there's the Moon by

168.239 --> 170.48000000000002
the way

171.12 --> 176.66
now roughly at 2 5th of a size

176.879 --> 181.94
can it pick it up

179.28 --> 181.94
no

182.28 --> 186.42
it's just so odd

184.8 --> 189.3
you know

186.42 --> 191.819
I'm looking with my eyes I can see the

189.3 --> 195.5
moon quite distinctly

191.819 --> 197.879
right but on the webcam literally

195.5 --> 201.5
staring straight at it

197.879 --> 201.5
and it doesn't pick up anything

203.64 --> 211.27999999999997
or am I mistaken is it picking up I

206.4 --> 211.28
because I'm not seeing it on there

213.72 --> 216.62
anyway

218.23 --> 221.35999999999999
[Music]

224.159 --> 227.7
uh

225.54 --> 231.56
the webcam couldn't pick it up because

227.7 --> 231.56
it was over the horizon right

232.5 --> 236.7
anyway

233.939 --> 240.239
you can't see it right

236.7 --> 242.159
low Elise G first in chat Mike zidunich

240.239 --> 248.09900000000002
good to see you

242.159 --> 248.099
it is Sunday the 8th of May 2022

249.48 --> 251.48
.

259.859 --> 264.65999999999997
doing a bit of a trouble starting up

262.919 --> 266.94
it's really like

264.66 --> 269.22
because of this weather it just makes me

266.94 --> 273.32
feel like I just want to sit

269.22 --> 273.32000000000005
in a chair in the sun somewhere

273.479 --> 278.34
half asleep

275.94 --> 281.52
but I'll get to it

278.34 --> 284.11999999999995
that's a show now oh camera freeze

281.52 --> 284.12
goody

290.639 --> 294.56
I didn't even hear anything hmm

300.24 --> 303.68
but anyway yesterday

304.199 --> 308.699
I think it was a pretty good show I

305.699 --> 311.66
didn't watch it back this time

308.699 --> 311.66
uh

312.18 --> 315.8
what was I doing yesterday

321.96 --> 326.479
I kind of I think like not a lot

327.12 --> 331.58
it wasn't like a lot of streams or

329.4 --> 331.58
anything

333.72 --> 340.259
oh yeah there was a Delwin life that was

336.3 --> 343.58
very in yeah entertaining

340.259 --> 343.58000000000004
so watch that

344.94 --> 350.16
and

347.759 --> 352.56
yeah that was pretty much it

350.16 --> 354.53900000000004
I did later on but that was like really

352.56 --> 357.139
late at night for me

354.539 --> 359.52
really Blaze like between

357.139 --> 363.36
one and two

359.52 --> 366.56
I did go like on flatter a 24 7 flighter

363.36 --> 366.56
Discord a bit

366.66 --> 370.139
like talking about a whole bunch of

368.819 --> 372.06
things

370.139 --> 373.919
but then eventually like the

372.06 --> 376.919
conversation went a bit so when somebody

373.919 --> 378.29999999999995
started talking about

376.919 --> 381.479
likes

378.3 --> 382.919
dragging in really dark [ __ ] and that

381.479 --> 385.68
just

382.919 --> 388.979
that broke my flow it's very easy right

385.68 --> 393.139
I I was like [ __ ] something like that

388.979 --> 393.139
could never happen on my own show

394.68 --> 401.58
but yeah everybody just speaks up and

397.38 --> 404.419
does whatever they want on there and

401.58 --> 404.419
ah

406.819 --> 413.0
but yeah most of it was pretty good

409.8 --> 413.0
got very technical

421.08 --> 423.74
what

426.78 --> 431.479
ah all right at least G lucky man

435.84 --> 438.61999999999995
who's Dale

442.979 --> 448.199
I don't get it I think you're using it

445.86 --> 450.06
Odell

448.199 --> 453.3
they'll lose it over

450.06 --> 456.979
the grace sky

453.3 --> 456.979
what I don't understand it

457.86 --> 463.139
what what do you mean grace Skye

461.039 --> 465.13
I mean Dell was losing it a little but

463.139 --> 466.52
that it's Dell

465.13 --> 470.15999999999997
[Music]

466.52 --> 473.0
and he deals with a whole bunch of

470.16 --> 473.0
well

473.039 --> 477.539
people that are attracted to Dell so

475.44 --> 480.18
there's always something to hassle about

477.539 --> 481.56
when he feels like it right sometimes he

480.18 --> 483.539
just doesn't feel like it is super

481.56 --> 488.12
mellow and other times he is just like

483.539 --> 488.12
I'm gonna I'm gonna delve down on this

489.419 --> 492.02
uh

493.979 --> 498.06
and we all love him for it by the way

496.09 --> 499.73999999999995
[Music]

498.06 --> 503.22
uh

499.74 --> 505.08
Graves I I just at least yeah you can

503.22 --> 506.879
say it like three more times that still

505.08 --> 509.419
doesn't make me understand what you're

506.879 --> 509.41900000000004
talking about

509.52 --> 512.66
gray sky

512.76 --> 520.08
you just mean about it being clouded or

515.88 --> 522.32
about like so presupposed Chemtrails or

520.08 --> 522.32
what

531.62 --> 534.74
all right

536.22 --> 539.0
uh

543.12 --> 548.04
all right that's pretty much it for my

545.22 --> 550.82
activities the rest was just gaming and

548.04 --> 550.8199999999999
just hanging around

551.839 --> 557.0
thinking about a whole bunch of things

554.1 --> 557.0
dream walking

570.12 --> 575.16
they're using voice to text

572.64 --> 576.0699999999999
yeah that's not gonna work

575.16 --> 579.279
release G

576.07 --> 579.279
[Music]

586.26 --> 590.3389999999999
this guy was great

587.76 --> 592.74
I was never

590.339 --> 594.98
learned about that kind of cloud in

592.74 --> 594.98
school

596.76 --> 603.48
yeah that's true

598.86 --> 605.279
yeah when I was learning about like uh

603.48 --> 609.019
meteorology

605.279 --> 612.779
yeah they meteorology did not include

609.019 --> 614.88
artificially made cloud formation and

612.779 --> 617.3389999999999
all that yeah it didn't it hasn't

614.88 --> 619.32
included that in my teaching I'm I don't

617.339 --> 621.5400000000001
know if they even still teach me geology

619.32 --> 625.019
in school now

621.54 --> 627.86
like a basic form of it

625.019 --> 627.86
I don't know

630.6 --> 635.88
but yeah when when it's like really

633.18 --> 637.68
trailed the [ __ ] all the [ __ ] and it's

635.88 --> 638.519
like all a bunch of checkerboards up

637.68 --> 643.04
there

638.519 --> 643.04
yeah that that can be very annoying

644.399 --> 647.98
it really does feel like yeah they're

646.5 --> 649.38
just ruining the good weather

647.98 --> 651.66
[Music]

649.38 --> 653.88
or maybe they're not and they're like oh

651.66 --> 655.56
we're just carefully geoengineering for

653.88 --> 658.459
optimal weather

655.56 --> 661.7399999999999
blah blah

658.459 --> 662.64
optimizing crops and I'd be like yeah

661.74 --> 665.42
man

662.64 --> 669.42
well why don't you just be open about it

665.42 --> 671.2199999999999
instead of just doing it and accusing

669.42 --> 673.86
people that point at it of being

671.22 --> 677.339
conspiracy theorists like why don't you

673.86 --> 679.26
just apply the geoengineering

677.339 --> 681.7790000000001
in a proper way

679.26 --> 683.88
without some kind of eugenics agenda

681.779 --> 686.399
behind it

683.88 --> 687.72
and just be open about it like the

686.399 --> 690.24
weather report

687.72 --> 694.2
so say like yeah the

690.24 --> 697.86
weather Arbiter for this region

694.2 --> 700.2
has planned in for yeah whether like

697.86 --> 701.04
Cloud Banks to be formed on that in that

700.2 --> 705.6
day

701.04 --> 707.8199999999999
because it's necessary for this and that

705.6 --> 711.8000000000001
right and just

707.82 --> 711.8000000000001
lay down what's actually happening

712.38 --> 718.38
and just drop this whole uh conspiracy

715.86 --> 719.4590000000001
theories how dare you say we're doing

718.38 --> 721.56
that

719.459 --> 723.899
when you're obviously doing that right

721.56 --> 726.8389999999999
just drop that [ __ ]

723.899 --> 729.0
and get honest integrated right it's a

726.839 --> 733.2790000000001
technological upgrade

729.0 --> 733.279
stop keeping it a secret

741.26 --> 746.36
wow I think we got a derp alert here

746.639 --> 749.66
hello [ __ ]

757.92 --> 762.3199999999999
any more blind Wild assertions

768.779 --> 771.779
foreign

775.81 --> 779.0799999999999
[Music]

783.68 --> 787.2199999999999
before the tunnel

795.42 --> 801.7199999999999
no no that's not true towards Sanford

798.6 --> 805.5600000000001
school doesn't make you unintelligent

801.72 --> 807.4200000000001
it's just built to make it really easy

805.56 --> 810.4799999999999
for you

807.42 --> 813.42
to not be intelligent and still

810.48 --> 815.279
get successful that's the problem it

813.42 --> 816.899
doesn't make you unintelligent if you're

815.279 --> 819.66
intelligent

816.899 --> 823.44
then you can still apply that

819.66 --> 824.76
it's just gonna be that people that are

823.44 --> 826.98
[ __ ]

824.76 --> 829.079
probably will still make it and then

826.98 --> 832.6990000000001
call you stupid

829.079 --> 836.76
for questioning the actual context and

832.699 --> 838.68
history and the mechanical details of

836.76 --> 841.019
the information you're learning in

838.68 --> 842.88
school right that's how it works

841.019 --> 845.579
and they think they're the special smart

842.88 --> 847.26
boys because they just accepted exactly

845.579 --> 849.54
as as is

847.26 --> 852.12
and you find problems with it and they

849.54 --> 853.92
call you a [ __ ] for doubting it well

852.12 --> 856.579
they are the [ __ ] that's what comes

853.92 --> 856.579
from schools

856.92 --> 861.199
that school doesn't make you stupid

861.74 --> 868.6800000000001
unless it's a severely corrupt at school

865.74 --> 871.5600000000001
and there's just like seriously socially

868.68 --> 875.6389999999999
mentally deranged people as teachers

871.56 --> 878.579
that start to like push very aberrant

875.639 --> 881.4590000000001
behavior on little children right then

878.579 --> 884.16
it will make you stupid and deranged and

881.459 --> 887.699
all kinds of crazy [ __ ]

884.16 --> 889.92
but the school system of teaching gets

887.699 --> 892.38
together in a class under control that

889.92 --> 895.38
doesn't automatically make you stupid it

892.38 --> 898.079
just makes it easier for you to go

895.38 --> 899.3389999999999
through it when you're stupid see that's

898.079 --> 902.7199999999999
what it's for

899.339 --> 902.72
doesn't make you stupid

919.199 --> 928.56
one glow proof is

922.74 --> 931.699
school is the reason for both art no no

928.56 --> 934.8
tarot dude

931.699 --> 937.62
hey turret how old are you

934.8 --> 940.019
maybe it's time to start like seriously

937.62 --> 942.9590000000001
looking for a wife because like you're

940.019 --> 945.0
getting so smarty mouth

942.959 --> 947.5999999999999
every time

945.0 --> 947.6
I mean

948.3 --> 953.54
you you need some chemistry from the

951.12 --> 953.54
other side

955.199 --> 957.74
anyway

970.86 --> 975.0790000000001
to Black what

976.74 --> 983.22
all of you are old

980.82 --> 984.6
yes

983.22 --> 987.839
yes

984.6 --> 990.0600000000001
so you're assuming that we're all old

987.839 --> 991.62
you think that when you're old that you

990.06 --> 994.8199999999999
become stupid

991.62 --> 994.82
is that what you think

996.959 --> 1003.6389999999999
yes is it what I don't know it might it

999.899 --> 1003.639
might just be a 12 year old kid

1004.94 --> 1009.519
those things sees all that because it's

1006.98 --> 1009.519
springtime

1030.74 --> 1036.559
if you mean systematic sure a lot of

1034.64 --> 1038.6000000000001
young people especially engaging on the

1036.559 --> 1041.62
internet are very systematic because

1038.6 --> 1045.3799999999999
they've been confronted more with

1041.62 --> 1048.6789999999999
computer-based systematic things now to

1045.38 --> 1051.679
do things structures then actual

1048.679 --> 1054.919
physical real world actions

1051.679 --> 1059.299
so yeah they're not they will naturally

1054.919 --> 1061.46
have more of a robotic like mind

1059.299 --> 1065.4189999999999
I had that

1061.46 --> 1068.32
in a time when it wasn't as overt even I

1065.419 --> 1068.3200000000002
kind of chose that

1074.24 --> 1079.58
right but youngsters in this age will

1077.539 --> 1083.419
automatically

1079.58 --> 1085.1
act more computer-ish because that's the

1083.419 --> 1087.0200000000002
majority of what they're being exposed

1085.1 --> 1089.24
to you see

1087.02 --> 1092.36
you become what you interact with you

1089.24 --> 1093.86
you copy the patterns of what you

1092.36 --> 1096.26
interact with

1093.86 --> 1098.5
that's natural especially when you're

1096.26 --> 1098.5
young

1108.62 --> 1111.28
what

1111.38 --> 1117.5590000000002
it's a kid of an age it's called it's

1114.5 --> 1121.059
called Pikachu RB it's called Pikachu

1117.559 --> 1121.059
you can just call it Pikachu

1122.66 --> 1126.8600000000001
not a kid's Asian cartoon it's called

1125.66 --> 1130.24
Pikachu

1126.86 --> 1130.24
from Pokemon yes

1139.85 --> 1143.01
[Music]

1143.539 --> 1149.9
but yeah I think I think RB you might

1146.48 --> 1151.88
have called it originally I think he

1149.9 --> 1153.799
might just be an anti-flat earth or

1151.88 --> 1156.0390000000002
troll

1153.799 --> 1159.3799999999999
because he's not

1156.039 --> 1161.6
responding in any way I'm sure I was

1159.38 --> 1166.419
trying to address him

1161.6 --> 1166.4189999999999
but he is just here to kind of

1166.58 --> 1170.74
yeah patrol around so

1177.76 --> 1181.6
yeah I know RB

1187.22 --> 1195.26
it's probably uh Bobby steals

1191.6 --> 1197.78
I recognize his faggish way of speaking

1195.26 --> 1200.36
now

1197.78 --> 1201.799
and he's not shy to act

1200.36 --> 1203.6589999999999
really

1201.799 --> 1208.059
like

1203.659 --> 1208.0590000000002
out of line so that's it

1213.38 --> 1216.479
[Music]

1231.74 --> 1237.34
right anyway that was kind of a waste of

1235.159 --> 1237.3400000000001
time

1244.4 --> 1247.5890000000002
[Music]

1249.2 --> 1254.48
yeah if you're actually 12 and you

1251.6 --> 1257.84
happen to bump into my show

1254.48 --> 1260.48
and you're miraculously interested in

1257.84 --> 1263.72
this very guy that's not helping you

1260.48 --> 1264.919
integrate and become all that with all

1263.72 --> 1267.919
them

1264.919 --> 1269.539
exactly the opposite rather

1267.919 --> 1271.94
yeah

1269.539 --> 1274.4
and you're still interested you can talk

1271.94 --> 1277.1000000000001
to me even if you're 12 right

1274.4 --> 1279.5590000000002
like I I don't pretty much everybody

1277.1 --> 1282.86
we're dealing with here in chat we don't

1279.559 --> 1285.3799999999999
shame people just because they're young

1282.86 --> 1288.1999999999998
so when we're calling somebody like oh

1285.38 --> 1290.179
you must be like a 12 year old

1288.2 --> 1294.14
that doesn't mean that we don't respect

1290.179 --> 1296.72
12 year olds right it just means that 12

1294.14 --> 1299.48
year olds on average have a more limited

1296.72 --> 1302.0
Insight on things that are very like

1299.48 --> 1304.039
like courageous with that

1302.0 --> 1305.96
they don't have a grip on a lot of

1304.039 --> 1308.24
things

1305.96 --> 1310.88
right and when somebody that's older

1308.24 --> 1312.38
acts like that it's basically telling

1310.88 --> 1314.1200000000001
them like you

1312.38 --> 1316.2990000000002
you don't have a grip on what you're

1314.12 --> 1316.299
doing

1317.299 --> 1323.179
right but actual 12 year olds that take

1320.96 --> 1324.799
life very serious and that have strong

1323.179 --> 1327.7
energy and good guidance from their

1324.799 --> 1327.7
parents and all that

1328.22 --> 1333.38
that are with yeah that'll get it

1331.159 --> 1335.659
they know that about themselves and

1333.38 --> 1338.5390000000002
they're usually a lot more respectful so

1335.659 --> 1342.0200000000002
don't worry about it if you're like 12

1338.539 --> 1344.6589999999999
don't worry my show is for anybody above

1342.02 --> 1347.0
12 pretty much

1344.659 --> 1349.96
and if you're under 12 I'd advise some

1347.0 --> 1349.96
Parental Guidance

1352.28 --> 1357.6789999999999
because yeah

1354.679 --> 1359.24
my behavioral spectrum is kind of over

1357.679 --> 1361.4
the place

1359.24 --> 1363.26
and it is important to have like

1361.4 --> 1365.539
somebody that

1363.26 --> 1366.74
has Insight on much bigger picture

1365.539 --> 1369.679
things

1366.74 --> 1371.78
to guide you through the things that I

1369.679 --> 1375.38
sometimes go through

1371.78 --> 1377.74
if you're younger than 12. anyway

1375.38 --> 1380.6000000000001
you do not respect Pat cartoons since

1377.74 --> 1382.1
okay Arby

1380.6 --> 1385.34
I don't think anything's wrong with

1382.1 --> 1388.059
Pokemon no I'm not more wrong than the

1385.34 --> 1388.059
usual but

1388.1 --> 1392.86
I I have fond memories watching Pokemon

1396.74 --> 1401.6200000000001
I mean it got a bit boring eventually

1399.08 --> 1401.62
but

1401.72 --> 1405.64
yeah I mean I've seen a lot worse

1416.0 --> 1418.179
thank you

1420.58 --> 1425.02
[Music]

1422.36 --> 1425.02
uh

1428.779 --> 1436.46
It's Scooby-Doo right no I definitely

1433.279 --> 1438.679
like Pokemon more than I do Scooby-Doo

1436.46 --> 1440.9
this

1438.679 --> 1445.0
no I never liked Scooby-Doo I always

1440.9 --> 1445.0
thought they were incredibly annoying

1449.779 --> 1456.2
and I get it there is a nostalgic thing

1453.26 --> 1458.6589999999999
for a whole bunch of people well I

1456.2 --> 1461.419
missed that I missed that bus

1458.659 --> 1465.14
absolutely I did I never liked it the

1461.419 --> 1468.22
cartoon movie it all just annoys me

1465.14 --> 1468.22
like a lot

1469.76 --> 1474.679
yeah

1471.86 --> 1477.62
but hey if you like it I'm all it's all

1474.679 --> 1480.88
good man I don't blame you it's just I

1477.62 --> 1480.8799999999999
don't just so you know

1498.38 --> 1504.98
okay

1501.26 --> 1507.58
not day long on my birthday

1504.98 --> 1507.58
okay

1513.26 --> 1519.919
getting old sad the old is all nonsense

1516.38 --> 1522.3200000000002
man it is really all in the eye of like

1519.919 --> 1524.24
the real age the only age that really

1522.32 --> 1526.3999999999999
matters is the age

1524.24 --> 1527.9
of your spirit and your will it's the

1526.4 --> 1529.96
preponderance of what you got left

1527.9 --> 1532.64
inside

1529.96 --> 1533.9
bodily oldness

1532.64 --> 1537.64
right

1533.9 --> 1537.64
it's a whole different thing

1539.48 --> 1545.6
I mean yeah I'm 42.

1542.539 --> 1548.24
but I absolutely and like really don't

1545.6 --> 1551.12
feel that like really don't feel that

1548.24 --> 1553.159
old I mean sometimes I feel like oh [ __ ]

1551.12 --> 1556.0
I'm getting old

1553.159 --> 1559.4
but like when I'm just me and just like

1556.0 --> 1562.159
not thinking and I'm just being me and

1559.4 --> 1564.3200000000002
feeling my situation I'm like dude I'm

1562.159 --> 1568.64
really young

1564.32 --> 1571.1589999999999
I'm practically still like 30. but

1568.64 --> 1574.22
my mind has

1571.159 --> 1576.679
laid some burdens on me

1574.22 --> 1579.44
because of everything I do

1576.679 --> 1582.0800000000002
right I could potentially like throw

1579.44 --> 1584.26
that off my shoulders if I really needed

1582.08 --> 1584.26
to

1584.419 --> 1590.2990000000002
but I don't do that on average

1587.0 --> 1593.96
but physically I am really young

1590.299 --> 1596.179
and I've taken massive efforts

1593.96 --> 1599.299
throughout my life starting at a very

1596.179 --> 1603.679
young age to do that to like stay young

1599.299 --> 1605.679
to not let like Despair and hopelessness

1603.679 --> 1608.179
Sensations

1605.679 --> 1610.88
dragged me into the darkness and

1608.179 --> 1613.5800000000002
literally rip the life from me because I

1610.88 --> 1616.46
was distinctly remember there being many

1613.58 --> 1617.6589999999999
of those times where that could have

1616.46 --> 1620.659
happened

1617.659 --> 1624.0200000000002
if I just said oh [ __ ] it

1620.659 --> 1629.6000000000001
right yeah well guess what I didn't oh

1624.02 --> 1632.6589999999999
[ __ ] it and now I'm really young at 42.

1629.6 --> 1635.98
it almost makes up for everything else

1632.659 --> 1635.98
that's happened in my life

1637.4 --> 1642.3400000000001
and like the weird predicament that my

1641.059 --> 1646.6399999999999
character

1642.34 --> 1648.6789999999999
that I am in where I have a chronic

1646.64 --> 1651.74
passivity problem

1648.679 --> 1653.72
but that I am working with

1651.74 --> 1656.8990000000001
because I always have to be productive

1653.72 --> 1659.5
no matter what even in passivity

1656.899 --> 1659.5
so

1661.64 --> 1666.919
in that case you're 17 and a half

1664.399 --> 1669.26
right

1666.919 --> 1671.539
what else I think you're probably

1669.26 --> 1673.58
underestimating like how much that

1671.539 --> 1677.6
actually feels like

1673.58 --> 1679.52
I mean 70 and a half is in that age you

1677.6 --> 1682.52
like

1679.52 --> 1685.58
not even in your interpersonal Dynamics

1682.52 --> 1688.6399999999999
but on average you just have too much

1685.58 --> 1690.799
hormones almost everybody does at that

1688.64 --> 1692.779
age right

1690.799 --> 1694.279
it's very unlikely you're literally

1692.779 --> 1696.679
gonna feel like that

1694.279 --> 1698.72
unless you've been boosting yourself up

1696.679 --> 1702.02
like dramatically

1698.72 --> 1703.64
and all that with yeah with just Health

1702.02 --> 1706.24
routines and all that

1703.64 --> 1706.24
but

1708.2 --> 1711.039
like 21

1711.08 --> 1714.6789999999999
for me was like when that kind of

1713.24 --> 1717.74
stopped

1714.679 --> 1719.539
21 is really like when I transformed

1717.74 --> 1724.179
into

1719.539 --> 1724.179
I guess adulthood for real like the

1725.24 --> 1729.039
what do you call that adolescence

1729.2 --> 1736.6000000000001
when just the teen phase and all the

1731.659 --> 1736.6000000000001
hormone stuff finally really stopped

1737.12 --> 1742.6399999999999
stop being wild yes because I was still

1740.179 --> 1745.3990000000001
feeling like a teen when I was 21 like

1742.64 --> 1746.72
ready pretty much

1745.399 --> 1749.3799999999999
anyway

1746.72 --> 1749.38
uh

1754.399 --> 1761.539
right but the thing is we can grow older

1759.32 --> 1763.8799999999999
and if you just take everything serious

1761.539 --> 1765.2
you can retain your youth even as you

1763.88 --> 1767.659
get older

1765.2 --> 1772.76
but there will be physical issues though

1767.659 --> 1773.96
but the spirit is is a great compensator

1772.76 --> 1777.44
right

1773.96 --> 1779.8990000000001
it you could consider it or you could

1777.44 --> 1782.96
call it like the Yoda effect

1779.899 --> 1785.4189999999999
like I mean come on Yoda is what is he

1782.96 --> 1787.82
like 500 years old or something

1785.419 --> 1791.2990000000002
incredibly old man

1787.82 --> 1794.4189999999999
and he has bodily burnage you could he's

1791.299 --> 1797.24
animated that way right

1794.419 --> 1800.419
but he has

1797.24 --> 1802.94
heavy Spirit like he still has fragments

1800.419 --> 1805.1000000000001
of his young spirit with with the

1802.94 --> 1808.22
Limitless power and Dynamics and

1805.1 --> 1811.1789999999999
flexibility and then when it matters

1808.22 --> 1814.279
he calls it back and sadly

1811.179 --> 1816.679
you get the the mega fighting scenes

1814.279 --> 1820.88
with the lightsabers and [ __ ] right

1816.679 --> 1823.3400000000001
that's the Yoda effect well that is

1820.88 --> 1826.5800000000002
an option for people

1823.34 --> 1828.9189999999999
right if you maintain your spirit then

1826.58 --> 1832.22
you can grow old and still be that young

1828.919 --> 1836.659
but always remember that your body is

1832.22 --> 1839.1200000000001
still slowly being subjected to entropy

1836.659 --> 1841.64
so you're gonna have to like Focus those

1839.12 --> 1843.26
moments of power where you reactivate

1841.64 --> 1846.6200000000001
everything

1843.26 --> 1848.24
more carefully and sparingly because you

1846.62 --> 1851.6
can't keep just

1848.24 --> 1853.94
opening up the gauge non-stop you'll

1851.6 --> 1854.9599999999998
literally burn your body up when you're

1853.94 --> 1857.419
older

1854.96 --> 1859.8400000000001
right that's the difference

1857.419 --> 1859.8400000000001
yeah

1865.7 --> 1869.539
you're supposed to become stronger as

1867.679 --> 1871.8200000000002
you age not weak well that's only if

1869.539 --> 1875.24
you're gonna actively build on your

1871.82 --> 1877.779
physical strength Tara 306.

1875.24 --> 1877.779
right

1880.34 --> 1885.6399999999999
you'll become stronger at whatever you

1882.799 --> 1885.6399999999999
practice the most

1886.1 --> 1891.1589999999999
but physical strength is not everything

1894.76 --> 1898.089
[Music]

1902.12 --> 1908.3
physical strength is just a strategy

1904.64 --> 1909.8600000000001
it's just a life strategy that's all

1908.3 --> 1913.1789999999999
[Music]

1909.86 --> 1913.1789999999999
what's that clutch

1917.6 --> 1921.58
ah had another stream

1986.419 --> 1990.5
the day you decided to stop learning is

1988.88 --> 1992.3600000000001
when you're officially old now that's

1990.5 --> 1993.919
when you're that's when you're gonna

what's this uh

2077.02 --> 2082.419
no hair discovered via fed okay cool

2080.02 --> 2085.139
good to hear welcome to the Flat Earth

2082.419 --> 2085.1389999999997
early bird show

2085.179 --> 2087.419
foreign

2093.81 --> 2096.869
[Music]

2106.98 --> 2112.54
after so many shows but like I could

2110.8 --> 2114.6400000000003
have called it like the Flat Earth early

2112.54 --> 2116.88
bird Workshop

2114.64 --> 2116.8799999999997
foreign

2117.94 --> 2122.079
I really like this idea of a workshop I

2120.4 --> 2123.88
actually oh yeah now remember I had a

2122.079 --> 2126.3390000000004
bit of a phone conversation with my dad

2123.88 --> 2129.04
after having some updates

2126.339 --> 2131.74
it's always good

2129.04 --> 2134.44
and I told him about like yeah I figured

2131.74 --> 2136.18
out like if I just call it a workshop

2134.44 --> 2138.16
and think of it like that and I'll

2136.18 --> 2140.2
explain I was interacting on my show

2138.16 --> 2143.2
with my chat and everything and he said

2140.2 --> 2146.3799999999997
like hey that reminds me about we used

2143.2 --> 2148.5989999999997
to do we used to go to workshops

2146.38 --> 2149.92
and it was like that except it was in a

2148.599 --> 2151.96
room with people

2149.92 --> 2152.6800000000003
but it's pretty much how you described

2151.96 --> 2155.8
it

2152.68 --> 2159.339
and I was like oh wait I remember that

2155.8 --> 2161.98
the workshops that's like in my teens

2159.339 --> 2164.5
somewhere or even earlier pre-teens

2161.98 --> 2166.72
where they were going today I didn't but

2164.5 --> 2168.579
they just knew that they were doing my

2166.72 --> 2172.2
parents were doing that

2168.579 --> 2172.2000000000003
it's just funny like hey yeah

2174.82 --> 2180.42
but anyway it doesn't really matter

2176.32 --> 2184.2400000000002
whether it's called a workshop it's just

2180.42 --> 2186.7000000000003
it's a way to perceive what this show is

2184.24 --> 2189.52
and what the chat is especially like the

2186.7 --> 2193.2
Jets the work floor it's a workshop I'm

2189.52 --> 2193.2
basically like the guy on the radio

2193.359 --> 2198.54
and

2195.04 --> 2198.54
I interact with everybody

2202.48 --> 2209.14
yeah I guess sort of like an overseer

2206.44 --> 2212.02
in a way

2209.14 --> 2215.02
but it works really well for me because

2212.02 --> 2215.02
I

2215.44 --> 2221.98
I have like solitary power over the

2219.28 --> 2225.3390000000004
vocals right

2221.98 --> 2227.98
you can guys can talk all you like

2225.339 --> 2231.339
but you can only do it with text

2227.98 --> 2235.119
oh I have the full room for my verbal

2231.339 --> 2238.24
expression and that way I can focus more

2235.119 --> 2239.98
on rolling out just good quality way of

2238.24 --> 2243.339
saying things and all that and and

2239.98 --> 2246.28
in-depth explanations instead of having

2243.339 --> 2249.339
to like box it out against somebody else

2246.28 --> 2252.46
that also has verbal capabilities right

2249.339 --> 2254.98
because then they can ruin such moments

2252.46 --> 2257.32
this happens so many times

2254.98 --> 2260.38
in the past

2257.32 --> 2262.839
and that is the reason why I typically

2260.38 --> 2264.76
don't like to get guests on unless it's

2262.839 --> 2266.68
like special occasions

2264.76 --> 2270.099
I don't need it

2266.68 --> 2272.9199999999996
perfectly fine just being the only one

2270.099 --> 2275.94
with verbal capabilities auditory

2272.92 --> 2275.94
capabilities here

2282.579 --> 2286.8390000000004
right Workshop shows people that there's

2285.22 --> 2289.66
a lot of interaction right and that it's

2286.839 --> 2292.24
critical it's like a workshop without

2289.66 --> 2294.64
people on the work floor is nothing

2292.24 --> 2297.4599999999996
nothing is accomplished

2294.64 --> 2302.02
no new ideas are dug up

2297.46 --> 2304.48
no understanding has been enhanced

2302.02 --> 2306.7
it all depends on the people that come

2304.48 --> 2308.5
in the workshop and what what they're

2306.7 --> 2310.839
carrying what energy they have what

2308.5 --> 2313.18
ideas they have

2310.839 --> 2314.619
and how high can they really reach with

2313.18 --> 2317.74
that right

2314.619 --> 2319.3
and that creates like a connection

2317.74 --> 2321.7599999999998
with me

2319.3 --> 2325.3
because I can grab a whole bunch of

2321.76 --> 2327.94
high-level [ __ ] I just typically don't

2325.3 --> 2329.1400000000003
initiate that it's almost like I can't

2327.94 --> 2331.78
do it

2329.14 --> 2334.42
I think it's it's a magical thing in a

2331.78 --> 2336.099
way it's like I could potentially grab

2334.42 --> 2339.46
any subject

2336.099 --> 2341.2000000000003
but I can't do it because that's sort of

2339.46 --> 2343.7200000000003
like

2341.2 --> 2346.7999999999997
it will violate my cohesion

2343.72 --> 2351.52
so I can only really do that properly

2346.8 --> 2354.2200000000003
use the super refined detail approach in

2351.52 --> 2356.92
response to somebody else to basically

2354.22 --> 2361.2
Tinker Tailor the response

2356.92 --> 2361.2000000000003
I can't just initiate it

2361.54 --> 2365.02
that's much more difficult without a

2363.88 --> 2367.2400000000002
lead

2365.02 --> 2370.119
and it's also the reason why I don't

2367.24 --> 2372.7
spend all day long just or rating to

2370.119 --> 2374.44
nobody like just talking out loud in the

2372.7 --> 2375.7599999999998
air with nobody to hear that's why I

2374.44 --> 2378.579
don't do that

2375.76 --> 2382.38
because there is no interaction that way

2378.579 --> 2382.38
becomes completely pointless

2385.0 --> 2387.42
anyway

2387.64 --> 2394.06
right it's still I might still have

2389.68 --> 2396.2799999999997
guests on by the way at some point again

2394.06 --> 2399.24
I I mean I do kind of want to have

2396.28 --> 2403.0600000000004
seeking star water on

2399.24 --> 2404.56
once I get her Tarot deck in the mail

2403.06 --> 2406.96
because I want to review it with her

2404.56 --> 2409.72
together that that seems like a

2406.96 --> 2412.26
worthwhile thing to do

2409.72 --> 2412.2599999999998
hmm

2422.98 --> 2429.099
right but technically yeah the workshop

2425.38 --> 2432.339
you know it also draws in you can very

2429.099 --> 2433.96
much be in the chat

2432.339 --> 2437.0789999999997
just talking

2433.96 --> 2440.319
or you can be in the chat partially and

2437.079 --> 2442.0600000000004
like working yourself right

2440.319 --> 2443.38
I mean in the United States going to be

2442.06 --> 2445.24
very early

2443.38 --> 2447.1600000000003
you probably if you're going to be up

2445.24 --> 2449.2
that early you're probably like going to

2447.16 --> 2452.0989999999997
do certain types of chores especially if

2449.2 --> 2452.0989999999997
you're like on a farm

2452.14 --> 2455.8799999999997
and you might want to listen to

2453.76 --> 2459.1800000000003
something well in that case the workshop

2455.88 --> 2459.1800000000003
is like

2459.22 --> 2463.54
partially what you do like it's

2461.56 --> 2465.2799999999997
literally a workshop for you to work

2463.54 --> 2467.319
where you're at

2465.28 --> 2471.28
while you're mentally

2467.319 --> 2473.56
like attaching to what we do here online

2471.28 --> 2477.52
and then you could just use it as like a

2473.56 --> 2479.44
stimulating radio type situation right

2477.52 --> 2481.54
I mean it must be better than the

2479.44 --> 2484.319
average radio shows that are out there

2481.54 --> 2484.319
now oh God

2484.48 --> 2490.359
they're so contaminated so so

2488.22 --> 2493.5989999999997
unbelievably indoctrinating and

2490.359 --> 2497.0789999999997
contaminated dude yesterday

2493.599 --> 2501.7000000000003
I watched a bit of Dutch TV again

2497.079 --> 2503.5600000000004
it was like a sort of a musical Thing

2501.7 --> 2506.2
the music show

2503.56 --> 2508.96
and

2506.2 --> 2511.5989999999997
I just can't believe that it's there now

2508.96 --> 2514.859
that that this is what we do now this is

2511.599 --> 2514.8590000000004
what the Netherlands has become

2515.98 --> 2522.76
it wasn't even just outrageous gross sjw

2520.06 --> 2525.88
[ __ ] just there to be like yeah no no

2522.76 --> 2528.0
not at all no but it was so

2525.88 --> 2530.38
so like

2528.0 --> 2533.2
robotically manipulative and

2530.38 --> 2536.079
sophisticated and just abusing people's

2533.2 --> 2537.3999999999996
desperation to be able to show their own

2536.079 --> 2541.0
skills

2537.4 --> 2543.339
like this system abuses people that are

2541.0 --> 2545.38
desperate to show that show off their

2543.339 --> 2549.54
own skills just because they're proud of

2545.38 --> 2549.54
their skill they abuse those people

2550.0 --> 2557.2
for manipulation of opinion because

2554.26 --> 2559.8390000000004
at some point there was like

2557.2 --> 2562.5989999999997
yeah it was music and songs all kinds of

2559.839 --> 2564.94
stuff and there was like one guy that

2562.599 --> 2567.28
made it had a song

2564.94 --> 2570.3
and it was really impressive to me it

2567.28 --> 2570.3
was almost like

2571.359 --> 2577.18
on the frequency of what I would like

2574.48 --> 2580.18
except yeah it's just much much more

2577.18 --> 2583.0
manly surprisingly manly in ways but

2580.18 --> 2584.859
still like weird somewhere in between

2583.0 --> 2587.02
but it's just like different than the

2584.859 --> 2590.38
rest and it was really good

2587.02 --> 2595.0
and like it ended like really good

2590.38 --> 2598.119
like satisfying like even to me as in

2595.0 --> 2600.16
outside I was still like yeah man that's

2598.119 --> 2602.579
gonna lead that's gonna leave a mark of

2600.16 --> 2605.14
impression guess what happened

2602.579 --> 2606.3
immediately after immediately it's like

2605.14 --> 2609.46
oh commercial

2606.3 --> 2613.54
and guess what's next oh we're gonna

2609.46 --> 2616.839
interview this this lovely lovely people

2613.54 --> 2620.319
in the Dutch Parliament oh they're so

2616.839 --> 2622.9
nice they're so nice oh they mean all

2620.319 --> 2626.38
the best for us oh oh look at Premiere

2622.9 --> 2630.579
Premier rata oh he's such a good guy

2626.38 --> 2634.839
yeah they literally put those pieces of

2630.579 --> 2636.28
[ __ ] directly after a really heavy

2634.839 --> 2638.4
powered

2636.28 --> 2640.8590000000004
music event

2638.4 --> 2645.42
immediately they stuck it after that

2640.859 --> 2649.359
yearly for your unadulterated

2645.42 --> 2652.96
Psychopathic manipulation of the people

2649.359 --> 2655.92
to force everything that's good on in

2652.96 --> 2660.76
their minds onto these pieces of [ __ ]

2655.92 --> 2662.92
scumbag psychopaths in government

2660.76 --> 2664.8590000000004
we did that

2662.92 --> 2666.579
and it was

2664.859 --> 2669.46
atrocious

2666.579 --> 2671.92
it was it was just like you take

2669.46 --> 2675.359
something really beautiful

2671.92 --> 2675.359
and you literally

2676.119 --> 2680.76
God it's I don't even want to go there

2678.52 --> 2680.7599999999998
is

2681.28 --> 2685.3
it's so gross I feel gross even thinking

2684.04 --> 2688.42
about it

2685.3 --> 2690.4
but I'll have to like somehow give you a

2688.42 --> 2694.2000000000003
metaphor I'm sorry

2690.4 --> 2696.94
think of it as a statue of Mary right

2694.2 --> 2698.6189999999997
some of these statues like Catholics

2696.94 --> 2700.7200000000003
that really

2698.619 --> 2702.52
really like their statue they take it

2700.72 --> 2704.68
serious and whether it's good or not

2702.52 --> 2706.0
right but it's like amazing statue it's

2704.68 --> 2708.0989999999997
like really

2706.0 --> 2710.68
it inspires people right

2708.099 --> 2713.8
now then somebody then it's like oh yeah

2710.68 --> 2717.52
the statue takes the statue

2713.8 --> 2721.2400000000002
and then publicly starts to rape

2717.52 --> 2723.88
somebody with the Statue

2721.24 --> 2727.06
right after it's been used to basically

2723.88 --> 2730.42
worship and [ __ ] right that's the kind

2727.06 --> 2733.06
of [ __ ] that the government here in the

2730.42 --> 2737.5
Netherlands in conjunction with the

2733.06 --> 2741.7599999999998
media Mafia do now with people that's

2737.5 --> 2746.44
what they do now overtly overtly

2741.76 --> 2748.2400000000002
spiritual rape spiritual rape is what

2746.44 --> 2750.76
the government does now with the media

2748.24 --> 2751.8999999999996
here in the Netherlands yeah this is

2750.76 --> 2754.0600000000004
beyond

2751.9 --> 2756.76
what the United States mind control

2754.06 --> 2758.98
program is like it's beyond that my the

2756.76 --> 2761.1400000000003
United States mind control program from

2758.98 --> 2763.359
the Liberals is much more aggressive

2761.14 --> 2765.64
much more like break it down until

2763.359 --> 2767.56
they're done break it down until they're

2765.64 --> 2769.54
dumb and when they're dumb then it's

2767.56 --> 2771.0
just cattle hurting that's like the

2769.54 --> 2774.839
American

2771.0 --> 2778.24
liberal strategy in the Netherlands

2774.839 --> 2780.88
they really really want to pull you up

2778.24 --> 2784.1189999999997
in your innocence and then try to do

2780.88 --> 2788.319
their absolute best to convert you to a

2784.119 --> 2793.6600000000003
merciless Psychopathic Satanist

2788.319 --> 2796.42
to worship power above all things beauty

2793.66 --> 2799.92
energy God anything

2796.42 --> 2803.2000000000003
is subservant subservient to power

2799.92 --> 2806.14
that's what they're programming the

2803.2 --> 2809.02
Liberals in the Netherlands with and

2806.14 --> 2811.2999999999997
it's getting really bad it's getting

2809.02 --> 2814.24
like knife

2811.3 --> 2817.3
like like energy knives

2814.24 --> 2820.2999999999997
of spiritual assaults go through you as

2817.3 --> 2822.819
you watch this media now

2820.3 --> 2824.5600000000004
I just I can barely imagine that like

2822.819 --> 2827.5
thousands and thousands of people

2824.56 --> 2830.619
literally sitting in their chairs being

2827.5 --> 2832.78
spiritually sliced up and they don't

2830.619 --> 2834.099
even know it they don't even know it

2832.78 --> 2838.0
anymore

2834.099 --> 2844.059
it's so aggressive

2838.0 --> 2848.68
in a spiritual sense it's so evil super

2844.059 --> 2849.8390000000004
luciferian super double faced like vert

2848.68 --> 2852.8799999999997
like

2849.839 --> 2855.4
terror is behind the people that do

2852.88 --> 2858.7000000000003

oh good it's all good

2875.859 --> 2884.46
it's what it's like now it's psycho the

2879.46 --> 2884.46
television in the Netherlands is psycho

2886.839 --> 2894.099
it's scary I think it's very very scary

2891.04 --> 2895.3
the way television has become in the

2894.099 --> 2899.7400000000002
Netherlands

2895.3 --> 2903.88
just the way they do things is so

2899.74 --> 2906.16
it's the next level of corporatization

2903.88 --> 2908.8
it's like an industrial Spirit

2906.16 --> 2911.3799999999997
manipulation system it's industrialized

2908.8 --> 2914.98
it's fully automated industrialized

2911.38 --> 2917.98
everybody is doing that now there and

2914.98 --> 2920.859
they're all slaves they're slaves

2917.98 --> 2922.72
to the mind control program that they're

2920.859 --> 2925.0
wielding themselves they don't nobody

2922.72 --> 2926.14
even knows who's writing the program for

2925.0 --> 2929.079
them

2926.14 --> 2931.66
they just follow it all of them nobody

2929.079 --> 2934.7200000000003
knows who is actually

2931.66 --> 2937.18
creating that Spirit cohesion that that

2934.72 --> 2938.7999999999997
program for them nobody knows who's

2937.18 --> 2941.3799999999997
doing that

2938.8 --> 2943.48
but it's just happening to them and

2941.38 --> 2947.6800000000003
they're all probably scared as [ __ ]

2943.48 --> 2952.359
because they know we are a face of evil

2947.68 --> 2954.22
all of us deserve to be executed

2952.359 --> 2957.52
on a pyre

2954.22 --> 2959.5589999999997
like that's like this level of

2957.52 --> 2963.7
manipulation that's

2959.559 --> 2965.8
pretty overt satanic witchcraft in

2963.7 --> 2968.5
medieval times if somebody was trying to

2965.8 --> 2970.599
pull that off

2968.5 --> 2973.72
right and they didn't have some big

2970.599 --> 2977.7400000000002
Power broker behind them or whatever

2973.72 --> 2980.02
they'd be [ __ ] executed

2977.74 --> 2983.64
like no questions it wouldn't even

2980.02 --> 2985.2
require some political game it's like

2983.64 --> 2988.2999999999997
evil

2985.2 --> 2989.7599999999998
evil manipulation evil political

2988.3 --> 2992.98
manipulation

2989.76 --> 2995.26
non-stop political bias non-stop always

2992.98 --> 2997.72
it's like multiculturalism is good

2995.26 --> 3000.38
multiculturalism is good like you can

2997.72 --> 3004.02
never ever surrender

3000.38 --> 3006.96
multiculturalism it's good never let it

3004.02 --> 3009.54
go there can be no everybody has to

3006.96 --> 3013.26
blend in until everybody looks exactly

3009.54 --> 3013.2599999999998
the same Multicultural

3015.54 --> 3021.66
right Netherlands right because it's so

3018.72 --> 3025.2799999999997
good it's so good for you to keep

3021.66 --> 3025.2799999999997
following that Madness

3025.44 --> 3030.119
because it's all love it's a lover it's

3028.619 --> 3033.8
a love

3030.119 --> 3037.579
no just don't just don't cancel the

3033.8 --> 3037.579
multiculturalism oh no

3037.8 --> 3045.059
yeah now do [ __ ] cancel the

3040.68 --> 3047.22
multiculturalism so every single race

3045.059 --> 3050.8390000000004
or whatever

3047.22 --> 3054.0589999999997
tribe they can get their [ __ ] bearing

3050.839 --> 3058.619
and remember who they are where they

3054.059 --> 3063.059
come from what their people actually is

3058.619 --> 3067.76
like and find some [ __ ] dignity

3063.059 --> 3070.44
you can't be a separate culture in

3067.76 --> 3073.079
multiculturalism it doesn't work you're

3070.44 --> 3078.3
gonna blend into a soup until there's

3073.079 --> 3081.48
nothing left but Satan wielding you

3078.3 --> 3083.6400000000003
he strips away everything

3081.48 --> 3086.04
your culture doesn't mean anything

3083.64 --> 3089.819
anymore it will just become a political

3086.04 --> 3092.52
weapon against the virtual enemy

3089.819 --> 3095.579
it won't be that culture anymore the

3092.52 --> 3098.88
reasons why those things were a part of

3095.579 --> 3101.46
your tribe will be lost the knowledge

3098.88 --> 3105.2400000000002
the context of all of that will be lost

3101.46 --> 3107.78
forever it will be erased your Culture

3105.24 --> 3113.0
Your Roots will be erased

3107.78 --> 3117.119
multiculturalism destroys all culture

3113.0 --> 3119.76
all culture destroyed erased

3117.119 --> 3124.079
all of it everything that becomes part

3119.76 --> 3127.2000000000003
of it will be erased nobody will know or

3124.079 --> 3130.44
understand anything about culturally

3127.2 --> 3133.319
approved things anymore nobody will

3130.44 --> 3136.02
understand why where it comes from

3133.319 --> 3138.24
nobody will care anymore because it

3136.02 --> 3142.619
doesn't mean anything anymore

3138.24 --> 3146.8799999999997
it's literally like a height

3142.619 --> 3149.88
from what do you call that like

3146.88 --> 3149.88
foreign

3150.68 --> 3156.1189999999997
from skinned people that are being shown

3153.9 --> 3160.859
of oh look at this culture oh they're so

3156.119 --> 3163.5
cultural it's like yeah they're dead

3160.859 --> 3167.0989999999997
you're using their hides and parading

3163.5 --> 3170.7
them like you are them now that's like

3167.099 --> 3175.6400000000003
[ __ ] voodoo magic [ __ ] except more

3170.7 --> 3175.64
sophisticated it's like seriously

3175.859 --> 3180.7799999999997
they're destroying cultures they're

3177.78 --> 3184.92
assimilating in it in them

3180.78 --> 3187.5
then they basically kill it off slowly

3184.92 --> 3191.339
by giving them other priorities that

3187.5 --> 3193.559
make you abandon your culture and the

3191.339 --> 3198.119
meaning and the context of it

3193.559 --> 3199.38
until they can just use their face like

3198.119 --> 3202.26
a mask

3199.38 --> 3206.04
and parade around like oh we are this we

3202.26 --> 3208.0200000000004
are this no you [ __ ] killed them you

3206.04 --> 3210.18
killed the entire context of their

3208.02 --> 3213.3
culture and now you're parading around

3210.18 --> 3217.6189999999997
their skin like a voodoo mask you

3213.3 --> 3220.94
[ __ ] satanic freaks

3217.619 --> 3224.78
[ __ ] you multiculturalism [ __ ] you

3220.94 --> 3224.78
Destroyer Satan

3240.11 --> 3243.159
[Music]

3254.099 --> 3258.1800000000003
right

3255.3 --> 3263.9
so that was my little response to

3258.18 --> 3263.8999999999996
watching 10 minutes of Dutch television

3265.559 --> 3270.98
and that's why I don't regularly watch

3268.02 --> 3270.98
Dutch television

3271.8 --> 3278.04
it's must be a nightmare it must be a

3275.339 --> 3281.7
nightmare so many people do watch

3278.04 --> 3284.2799999999997
television or at least accept it

3281.7 --> 3286.9199999999996
and that means that the people on

3284.28 --> 3289.76
average are gonna be so psychologically

3286.92 --> 3289.76
assaulted

3290.46 --> 3295.099
I don't know if anybody's gonna survive

3292.559 --> 3295.099
this [ __ ]

3296.28 --> 3299.88
just being passive and letting it all

3298.319 --> 3301.02
happen I don't think we're gonna survive

3299.88 --> 3304.02
that

3301.02 --> 3305.83
and again it comes down to that

3304.02 --> 3308.099
Crossroads

3305.83 --> 3310.44
[Music]

3308.099 --> 3312.48
What's it gonna take

3310.44 --> 3316.319
What's it gonna take before people say

3312.48 --> 3318.9
yeah [ __ ] this supposed [ __ ] all these

3316.319 --> 3322.859
things that make us passive in the face

3318.9 --> 3326.88
of Pure Evil all Notions all Future

3322.859 --> 3330.66
Vision anything anything [ __ ] it all

3326.88 --> 3333.299
The Satanist Must Die for what they're

3330.66 --> 3336.72
doing they must die how long will it

3333.299 --> 3339.0
take or will you literally

3336.72 --> 3341.5789999999997
allow yourself to be spiritually

3339.0 --> 3343.619
tortured to death slowly as you see

3341.579 --> 3346.619
everything Stripped Away from you

3343.619 --> 3349.559
anything you love being destroyed in

3346.619 --> 3353.099
every conceivable way there will be no

3349.559 --> 3356.6400000000003
element that you can think of that will

3353.099 --> 3359.04
be spared nothing everything you loved

3356.64 --> 3364.799
ever had any kind of positive feeling

3359.04 --> 3368.46
for will be destroyed if you continue

3364.799 --> 3372.599
this passivity in the face of this ever

3368.46 --> 3376.68
growing evil it will all be destroyed

3372.599 --> 3379.2200000000003
setting through it is not going to make

3376.68 --> 3379.22
it stop

3390.119 --> 3395.339
okay that's a little dramatic there

3391.92 --> 3397.5
Terror 306 but yeah pretty much

3395.339 --> 3401.52
I mean

3397.5 --> 3406.5
I think that a couple of very serious

3401.52 --> 3410.4
horrific death scenes will certainly

3406.5 --> 3412.38
snap the [ __ ] out of the world and the

3410.4 --> 3414.54
mindset like and it needs to happen

3412.38 --> 3417.2400000000002
people need to be snapped out of that

3414.54 --> 3420.599
like really snapped out

3417.24 --> 3423.0
like no more torture scenes where

3420.599 --> 3425.339
governments just like deciding like yeah

3423.0 --> 3427.26
we're just doing this to these people

3425.339 --> 3429.599
now and just watches people kill

3427.26 --> 3432.96
themselves and pets get more like yeah

3429.599 --> 3436.2000000000003
you want to do that no I'd rather see

3432.96 --> 3438.42
people going ballistic and then noticing

3436.2 --> 3441.68
oh wow look at all these politician

3438.42 --> 3441.6800000000003
heads on pikes

3442.02 --> 3447.66
that's what I want to see

3445.319 --> 3451.68
show me that I don't want to see more

3447.66 --> 3453.7799999999997
citizens of countries being tortured

3451.68 --> 3456.72
I don't want to see that I want to see

3453.78 --> 3458.2200000000003
the people that are doing that that are

3456.72 --> 3462.1189999999997
in the conviction

3458.22 --> 3464.9399999999996
that Humanity needs to be erased I want

3462.119 --> 3468.42
to see their heads on Pikes I want to

3464.94 --> 3470.7000000000003
see it I want to see their heads on

3468.42 --> 3474.7400000000002

hi brand am sorry you're out

[Music]

3515.099 --> 3521.4
nothing and for changes well yeah

3518.94 --> 3524.46
again it's two options

3521.4 --> 3526.799
either you do that

3524.46 --> 3529.68
why do you do that or you watch

3526.799 --> 3532.319
everything you have ever imagined ever

3529.68 --> 3534.96
thought of ever conceived ever

3532.319 --> 3538.859
appreciated on any level and you will

3534.96 --> 3541.26
see it all destroyed forever

3538.859 --> 3544.14
there will be nothing out there you

3541.26 --> 3546.059
could even think of that hasn't been

3544.14 --> 3549.1189999999997
violated

3546.059 --> 3552.42
until there's nothing left good about it

3549.119 --> 3554.94
will be nothing left if you remain

3552.42 --> 3557.46
passive do you understand it's literally

3554.94 --> 3560.76
hell unfolding right in front of

3557.46 --> 3564.0
everybody it's literal manifestation of

3560.76 --> 3566.6400000000003
Hell through people and other people not

3564.0 --> 3569.099
acting against it literal hell is

3566.64 --> 3571.14
manifesting and it's gonna get worse and

3569.099 --> 3574.6800000000003
worse oh you think there's a limit to it

3571.14 --> 3578.1189999999997
no there is no limit to it

3574.68 --> 3578.1189999999997
no limits

3588.43 --> 3591.5699999999997

3689.299 --> 3694.799
Nikolai chachesco

3692.099 --> 3697.619

right that's what we need that's what

3697.619 --> 3702.42
like

3698.579 --> 3704.9
all these people are like Nicola

but look it it helps it helps it's good

3715.92 --> 3722.7000000000003
for everybody they need to see the

3718.68 --> 3725.8799999999997
example of the demon getting killed they

3722.7 --> 3728.22
need to see the demon get killed and

3725.88 --> 3732.1800000000003
when it gets killed the power that it

3728.22 --> 3734.2799999999997
falsely wielded unabated will die with

3732.18 --> 3737.819
it and people will no longer be

3734.28 --> 3741.3590000000004
motivated to emulate that

3737.819 --> 3743.22
it needs to happen the satanists these

globalist Eugenics agenda

3753.0 --> 3759.9

3756.72 --> 3764.64
the price visibly for people

3759.9 --> 3767.1600000000003
to extinguish those [ __ ] ideas

3764.64 --> 3769.5
they need to be extinguished they can't

3767.16 --> 3771.7799999999997
be left roaming free

3769.5 --> 3774.44
thinking that that is good

3771.78 --> 3778.1400000000003
it should not be allowed it should be

3774.44 --> 3781.64
punished art publicly

3805.52 --> 3811.559
trying to equalize

3809.16 --> 3816.0589999999997
the horror that they inflicted because

3811.559 --> 3819.059
that can never be even out and like

3816.059 --> 3821.6400000000003
hardcore biblical Trinity Christians

3819.059 --> 3824.579
would say that's even out in the

3821.64 --> 3827.819
afterlife right and it might be yeah

3824.579 --> 3830.579
it's not about that it's not about I

3827.819 --> 3834.92
want to I want them to go through the

3830.579 --> 3838.619
same torture as what they did to others

3834.92 --> 3840.78
that's not the reason I mean

3838.619 --> 3842.2200000000003
could be conceived as a bonus even

3840.78 --> 3844.619
though when it actually happened it

3842.22 --> 3846.5389999999998
won't be a bonus because in reality it

3844.619 --> 3850.559
doesn't really work that way

3846.539 --> 3852.0
it's only a motivating idea

3850.559 --> 3854.8190000000004
right

3852.0 --> 3857.46
like just this Vengeance to hold on

3854.819 --> 3859.68
while something that's evil and done

3857.46 --> 3861.9
doing that is still in power

3859.68 --> 3865.02
in reality

3861.9 --> 3869.2400000000002
you can't equalize the damage

3865.02 --> 3873.24
you cannot do that but you can make it

3869.24 --> 3876.72
terrifying for others

3873.24 --> 3878.8799999999997
to show them this is what happens if you

3876.72 --> 3881.8799999999997
turn into a [ __ ] demon and you take

3878.88 --> 3883.26
power and you get people mentally

3881.88 --> 3886.92
tortured

3883.26 --> 3889.559
and like gets super corrupt and

3886.92 --> 3893.76
hypocritical and just political power

3889.559 --> 3896.52
for no reason and endless shaming good

3893.76 --> 3899.539
things this is what happens

3896.52 --> 3902.7
right a deterrent so it's not about

3899.539 --> 3904.8590000000004
equalizing some Vengeance because that

3902.7 --> 3907.2
doesn't work it doesn't work the only

3904.859 --> 3909.7799999999997
way that works is if you were literally

3907.2 --> 3912.96
allow yourself to personally be dragged

3909.78 --> 3914.1600000000003
into hell on their level just to get

3912.96 --> 3916.799
even

3914.16 --> 3918.839
is that really worth it no it's never

3916.799 --> 3920.88
worth it unfortunately

3918.839 --> 3923.46
because our imaginations would like to

3920.88 --> 3925.88
think that's worth it but it isn't in

3923.46 --> 3925.88
reality

3926.819 --> 3933.359
right well what you can do is make a

3930.359 --> 3935.7599999999998
serious deterrent

3933.359 --> 3940.7
to show like this

3935.76 --> 3940.7000000000003
this will be you if you do that too

3941.039 --> 3947.94
right

3942.66 --> 3950.7799999999997
and yeah make it graphic make it make it

3947.94 --> 3950.78
terrifying

3951.18 --> 3955.0789999999997
right

3952.5 --> 3957.66
make it real not just oh quickly after

3955.079 --> 3961.619
their mystery oh we need to be oh you

3957.66 --> 3963.5989999999997
you mean we can't did no no it's about

3961.619 --> 3967.2000000000003
the terror

3963.599 --> 3969.96
people have to be terrified when they

3967.2 --> 3972.359
see how this psycho

3969.96 --> 3973.799
monster demon

3972.359 --> 3975.66
sadist

3973.799 --> 3977.7
whoever that's gonna turn out to be

3975.66 --> 3979.92
right multiple examples throughout

3977.7 --> 3982.799
history when they

3979.92 --> 3985.859
get taken down everybody has to see that

3982.799 --> 3987.599
that's what will happen to you if you do

3985.859 --> 3989.5789999999997
that

3987.599 --> 3991.7400000000002
that's what it's about it's not about

3989.579 --> 3995.1800000000003
getting even with the horrible things

3991.74 --> 3995.18
that they did that's impossible

3996.78 --> 4000.28
just wanted to make that point

4002.74 --> 4005.81
[Music]

4019.819 --> 4022.66
dude

4024.02 --> 4031.46
tear it okay you do take it easy take it

4028.88 --> 4033.7400000000002
easy here okay

4031.46 --> 4035.9
you're saying things that are like

4033.74 --> 4038.24
really Crossing Lines here

4035.9 --> 4042.28
you should never say that you should

4038.24 --> 4042.2799999999997
never say go after their families

4042.5 --> 4047.66
unless like their families are like I'll

4045.26 --> 4050.0
probably in on it right if it's some

4047.66 --> 4053.1189999999997
normally in the top of the head is in

4050.0 --> 4055.28
power and like his own sons are like

4053.119 --> 4058.28
working together doing that yeah then

4055.28 --> 4060.079
they of course right but like little

4058.28 --> 4062.8390000000004
kids

4060.079 --> 4063.98
and all that that aren't involved they

4062.839 --> 4067.22
should not

4063.98 --> 4071.0
like it's not their fault

4067.22 --> 4073.5789999999997
right they might be weirdly spiritually

4071.0 --> 4076.819
tied in somehow well then just keep

4073.579 --> 4079.28
track of that right I mean

4076.819 --> 4081.619
there's like innocent kids coming out of

4079.28 --> 4085.6400000000003
like some Demon family

4081.619 --> 4088.76
let them grow up and keep track like do

4085.64 --> 4092.0
keep track like is are they gonna fall

4088.76 --> 4095.119
into some weird Sinister reenactment

4092.0 --> 4098.38
or are they actually going to try to be

4095.119 --> 4101.299
a normal a family or something right

4098.38 --> 4103.88
it's all about the choice

4101.299 --> 4105.98
and when kids are really young they

4103.88 --> 4108.319
can't really

4105.98 --> 4111.739
make that choice

4108.319 --> 4115.42
when they're surrounded by evil people

4111.739 --> 4115.419999999999
that rule over them

4116.96 --> 4122.06
it's not their fault

4120.02 --> 4124.88
I mean in the future it might become

4122.06 --> 4127.46
their fault as they grow up and then

4124.88 --> 4130.04
integrate with that family if it's still

4127.46 --> 4133.52
doing that right but if they're all like

4130.04 --> 4136.5199999999995
taken down arrested or executed yeah

4133.52 --> 4138.319
you're not gonna grow into that as a

4136.52 --> 4139.339000000001
little kid in the future because it's

4138.319 --> 4142.659000000001
gone

4139.339 --> 4142.659
they're not in power anymore

4143.54 --> 4148.299
yeah definitely leave out the kids

4148.339 --> 4156.259
so just pay careful attention

4152.9 --> 4160.7789999999995
to what you invoke even in chat stereo

4156.259 --> 4160.779
306 it matters all these things matter

4165.38 --> 4172.52
right all this Vengeance it is it should

4169.52 --> 4174.7390000000005
be in your mind that it is there

4172.52 --> 4177.319
to support Justice

4174.739 --> 4179.839
not the other way around it's not

4177.319 --> 4183.14
Justice is the excuse for your Vengeance

4179.839 --> 4185.0
that should never be the case

4183.14 --> 4189.64
because then

4185.0 --> 4189.64
you're gonna turn into yeah a beast

4205.04 --> 4212.84
it wouldn't spend the day in prison

4207.86 --> 4216.5599999999995
they wouldn't I don't know tear it dude

4212.84 --> 4218.96
I mean they will spend time in prison if

4216.56 --> 4220.34
a prison is specifically designed for

4218.96 --> 4224.2390000000005
them

4220.34 --> 4228.5
like a prison where they they don't

4224.239 --> 4231.5
get options of like oh but if you just

4228.5 --> 4234.92
pay this extra you get this just like no

4231.5 --> 4236.78
no no you can't actually pay your way

4234.92 --> 4239.26
out of this even if you have [ __ ]

4236.78 --> 4242.42
trillions nothing

4239.26 --> 4244.46
no no thing

4242.42 --> 4247.46
will mean anything

4244.46 --> 4250.159
in those prisons special

4247.46 --> 4254.56
Elite prison

4250.159 --> 4254.5599999999995
where money means absolutely nothing

4262.159 --> 4269.48
yeah all these things that now suck like

4265.34 --> 4271.04
oh oh the evil person or like the one

4269.48 --> 4272.718999999999
guy in the group that's taking the fall

4271.04 --> 4275.0
for everybody oh they get to go to

4272.719 --> 4276.92
prison but they're still like in a good

4275.0 --> 4279.08
position because they can buy themselves

4276.92 --> 4281.42
like in a really like basically a

4279.08 --> 4285.0199999999995
vacation home

4281.42 --> 4287.719
that's their prison then yeah oh that's

4285.02 --> 4293.679
only possible

4287.719 --> 4296.06
because they are in power to allow that

4293.679 --> 4299.86
you see

4296.06 --> 4299.860000000001
that's how it works

4299.96 --> 4308.179
it's not always going to be like that

4303.739 --> 4312.44
it only is when they're in power to

4308.179 --> 4315.8
allow that to set that standard that yes

4312.44 --> 4317.48
if you have money you have you can do

4315.8 --> 4319.28
whatever you want basically no matter

4317.48 --> 4320.718999999999
what your position is even if you're in

4319.28 --> 4323.719
prison if you have money you could

4320.719 --> 4326.42
basically buy half your freedom

4323.719 --> 4330.56
in there yeah that's the globalist

4326.42 --> 4334.1
system they like that and they are okay

4330.56 --> 4336.38
with that like they don't give a [ __ ]

4334.1 --> 4337.9400000000005
if monsters are

4336.38 --> 4339.62
like having a good life like that

4337.94 --> 4341.96
because they don't care they don't even

4339.62 --> 4343.76
want them in prison they want all the

4341.96 --> 4346.2390000000005
monsters out

4343.76 --> 4349.34
they want all the monsters out haunting

4346.239 --> 4350.9
regular people and killing them and

4349.34 --> 4353.6
torturing them and making their lives

4350.9 --> 4356.299999999999
miserable distracting them

4353.6 --> 4359.0
long enough so that they don't build up

4356.3 --> 4360.860000000001
and become stronger that's what the

4359.0 --> 4363.199
demons want that's why they built that

4360.86 --> 4365.78
system there with the prison that you

4363.199 --> 4370.58
can buy your way out

4365.78 --> 4376.159
yeah if they're not in control anymore

4370.58 --> 4378.739
that system can very easily go away and

4376.159 --> 4381.4
then they can't do that anymore

4378.739 --> 4381.4
huh

4386.9 --> 4391.299999999999
a Cold Spring screen it's you

4391.46 --> 4393.64
foreign

4423.95 --> 4429.739
[Music]

4427.04 --> 4433.6
the two witnesses what are you talking

4429.739 --> 4433.599999999999
about Terry or Matthew Hall

4440.38 --> 4443.52
[Music]

4462.44 --> 4469.839999999999
is this guy clutch

4465.32 --> 4469.84
I'm Arwin this is

4470.239 --> 4473.959999999999
I have a daily show called The Flat

4472.219 --> 4475.12
Earth early bird show and this is

4473.96 --> 4480.34
episode

4475.12 --> 4480.34
1237 so I've been going for a while

4506.239 --> 4509.08
oh okay

4513.5 --> 4517.64
oh you were picking up right I get it

4516.86 --> 4520.4
now

4517.64 --> 4522.9800000000005
because I knew you knew him because you

4520.4 --> 4525.62
have streams together

4522.98 --> 4527.959999999999
so because of that I didn't assume that

4525.62 --> 4530.36
you were making a sarcastic remark

4527.96 --> 4532.219
towards clutch I thought that you were

4530.36 --> 4535.759999999999
referencing me and you were asking

4532.219 --> 4537.679
clutch see how easy it is to interpret

4535.76 --> 4541.3
that

4537.679 --> 4541.3
yeah anyway

4558.56 --> 4564.92
saying about material yeah but tarot was

4561.26 --> 4567.820000000001
going a bit overboard

4564.92 --> 4570.679
and I know right look who's talking I

4567.82 --> 4573.04
basically went a bit overboard it's just

4570.679 --> 4573.04
that

4573.08 --> 4575.62
and

4577.28 --> 4583.759999999999
I'm trying to do it right

4580.1 --> 4586.58
whatever that really means

4583.76 --> 4590.6
I just avoid things that I know are

4586.58 --> 4592.699
wrong and explain explain

4590.6 --> 4596.06
how

4592.699 --> 4598.159
these heavy energies and rage and all

4596.06 --> 4600.02
that how that really works what that

4598.159 --> 4601.159
really does with you what you should

4600.02 --> 4605.4400000000005
expect

4601.159 --> 4605.44
how the Dynamics that included

4605.84 --> 4611.02
how situations change because of those

4608.48 --> 4611.0199999999995
Dynamics

4618.62 --> 4625.599999999999
but yeah Terry

4621.46 --> 4625.6
gets carried away sometimes

4625.76 --> 4630.92
and I think today is one of those days

4627.44 --> 4633.44
and then yeah when I get really heated

4630.92 --> 4636.08
there it is I imagine terrets like

4633.44 --> 4637.239
dancing in the room when I do that like

4636.08 --> 4641.12
yeah yeah yeah

4637.239 --> 4644.0
because I'm pretty sure turret it has a

4641.12 --> 4646.699
similar effect to what I had that is

4644.0 --> 4649.159
that's just this bottle up

4646.699 --> 4653.0
vengeance

4649.159 --> 4656.0
because of his I think turret has a

4653.0 --> 4658.64
pretty high Consciousness potential

4656.0 --> 4662.44
and yeah that's gonna

4658.64 --> 4662.4400000000005
create that as a side effect

4663.38 --> 4665.9800000000005
so

4666.92 --> 4671.0
but yeah he goes a little far sometimes

4669.14 --> 4673.1
and then I just have to kind of correct

4671.0 --> 4676.1
him

4673.1 --> 4678.320000000001
but I totally get it like hey if I I

4676.1 --> 4680.780000000001
could like take off all limiters and

4678.32 --> 4683.599999999999
just spout spouting just like I'll kill

4680.78 --> 4685.639999999999
them killed scale that yeah I I have

4683.6 --> 4687.5
that in me too I just know it's

4685.64 --> 4690.02
completely useless

4687.5 --> 4692.179
it just makes me look crazy

4690.02 --> 4694.040000000001
when you do that and I don't want to do

4692.179 --> 4696.4400000000005
that I would never actually allow

4694.04 --> 4700.159
actions that come forth from me to be

4696.44 --> 4703.639999999999
fueled by that sort of

4700.159 --> 4705.879999999999
mental cohesion or lack of cohesion if

4703.64 --> 4705.88
you will

4706.94 --> 4710.719
I have had my family and friends wow

4709.699 --> 4713.0
yeah

4710.719 --> 4715.04
yeah if you cared about them a lot yeah

4713.0 --> 4717.32
then I can imagine that

4715.04 --> 4719.54
you want some justice I've been very

4717.32 --> 4723.199
lucky to not

4719.54 --> 4726.199
have a lot of family or whatever perish

4723.199 --> 4728.839999999999
because of the vaccines

4726.199 --> 4732.4
because a lot of them perished way

4728.84 --> 4732.400000000001
before all that even happened

4732.62 --> 4735.099999999999
right

4735.26 --> 4741.58
I have a general Grudge towards the

4737.48 --> 4741.58
medical system because of that

4741.8 --> 4744.8
because they see so many problems with

4743.48 --> 4747.08
them

4744.8 --> 4750.679
and just the way that that systems build

4747.08 --> 4753.28
up and what the doctors do with it

4750.679 --> 4753.28
right

4754.28 --> 4761.0
so I don't have a lot of like personal

4756.679 --> 4763.219
Vengeance even it's just I know that a

4761.0 --> 4767.36
lot of people out there will

4763.219 --> 4768.7390000000005
it was a very serious worldwide attack

4767.36 --> 4771.5599999999995
yeah

4768.739 --> 4774.259999999999
the corona lockdowns the vaccines

4771.56 --> 4775.88
pushing that on people gaslighting

4774.26 --> 4776.780000000001
everybody that's the best thing in the

4775.88 --> 4779.679
world

4776.78 --> 4783.92
that was probably one of the biggest

4779.679 --> 4787.04
psychological and medical assaults

4783.92 --> 4789.76
that the world has ever endured in like

4787.04 --> 4789.76
a hundred years

4792.62 --> 4795.219
so

4795.739 --> 4801.5
more maybe

4798.62 --> 4803.42
right so people are gonna have Vengeance

4801.5 --> 4806.6
bubble up inside them

4803.42 --> 4809.12
I want to basically kind of give them a

4806.6 --> 4811.88
promise all of them like yes

4809.12 --> 4814.159
like We're Not Gonna Let It Go but don't

4811.88 --> 4817.28
let it consume you until then it might

4814.159 --> 4819.799999999999
take a long time right all that you have

4817.28 --> 4822.08
to realize with this sort of [ __ ] and it

4819.8 --> 4824.84
is [ __ ] and it always sucks it will

4822.08 --> 4828.26
never not suck right even like after

4824.84 --> 4832.659000000001
World War II look how [ __ ] long all

4828.26 --> 4838.96
that took it took so long

4832.659 --> 4838.96
trials are slow as [ __ ] and tedious

4839.78 --> 4845.599999999999
and yeah

4842.36 --> 4848.96
it's just gonna suck

4845.6 --> 4851.2390000000005
right but it's Gotta happen like they

4848.96 --> 4855.5
literally pretty much no matter the cost

4851.239 --> 4857.9
cannot be allowed to get away with this

4855.5 --> 4862.159
right

4857.9 --> 4867.62
just like suppose it uh what is it

4862.159 --> 4870.08
Mossad went out and hunted Nazi

4867.62 --> 4874.219
like Nazi criminals that fled and all

4870.08 --> 4877.639
that yeah I want that too with Corona

4874.219 --> 4878.86
people with the ones that are new they

4877.639 --> 4881.54
muted

4878.86 --> 4883.58
whatever a [ __ ] hell man the

producers that are producing these

4883.58 --> 4889.9
vaccines that are not vaccines that are

4885.94 --> 4889.9
provably killing people

4890.3 --> 4896.719
and creating all kinds of medical Havoc

4892.9 --> 4901.42
a terrible Financial drain alone on the

4896.719 --> 4901.42
public right it's just an overt assault

4903.8 --> 4910.639
and they should be made to pay until the

4907.159 --> 4913.638999999999
last man no one can get away and if some

4910.639 --> 4916.82
piece of [ __ ] out there is gonna decide

4913.639 --> 4919.219
oh we're gonna do the same thing as what

4916.82 --> 4921.44
the US did with the Nazis graft them

4919.219 --> 4923.3
into their space program or something

4921.44 --> 4928.239
fine

4923.3 --> 4928.2390000000005

the muscle cells disintegrate they

release a protein called myoglobin weird

5554.92 --> 5559.659
I've never heard of that before

so is it like a local thing it's just

5559.659 --> 5564.339999999999
like a muscle it's not because if it's

5562.239 --> 5567.36

5564.34 --> 5567.360000000001
of what is it called again

5567.58 --> 5571.659
is it like multiple sclerosis or

5569.679 --> 5573.6990000000005
something what was it

5571.659 --> 5576.04
well there is this disease I've even met

5573.699 --> 5577.719
a person like that where literally their

5576.04 --> 5580.42
muscles all just start to break down

5577.719 --> 5582.219
slowly it is actually there's something

5580.42 --> 5587.28
you could do about that

5582.219 --> 5587.28
especially with uh cannabis oil

5589.84 --> 5594.219
if you're like early on that's what I

5593.02 --> 5597.659000000001
heard at least

5594.219 --> 5597.659

5654.699 --> 5661.259999999999
necessarily want to like pull like

5657.159 --> 5661.259999999999
private medical information out of you

5664.48 --> 5668.919999999999
I'm just trying to understand like how

5666.639 --> 5669.88
that happened was it like an accident or

5668.92 --> 5672.04
just

5669.88 --> 5674.26
I don't know you don't have to tell me

5672.04 --> 5677.04
anyway

5674.26 --> 5677.04
ah

5681.58 --> 5687.219
you know what I find really weird about

5683.5 --> 5689.5
what I do and my all my constant

5687.219 --> 5694.32
self-analysis

5689.5 --> 5694.32
instead now that I got all that [ __ ] out

5694.719 --> 5700.84
like yeah judgments if you will

5698.34 --> 5703.0
judgments about a certain group of

5700.84 --> 5704.26
people what should happen with them

5703.0 --> 5707.08
right

5704.26 --> 5710.400000000001
I feel like really different now

5707.08 --> 5713.32
because I had like a weird like I have

5710.4 --> 5716.4
it sitting like on my stomach or

5713.32 --> 5716.4
something sometimes

5717.46 --> 5722.139
and then it's like I don't want to

5719.619 --> 5725.0199999999995
address it I just want to ignore it but

5722.139 --> 5727.96
then I kind of feel shitty

5725.02 --> 5730.42
until I finally like it just comes

5727.96 --> 5732.34
around and then it goes then suddenly it

5730.42 --> 5734.58
comes out and then afterward I feel

5732.34 --> 5734.58
better

5735.4 --> 5740.799999999999
I feel better because

5737.5 --> 5744.88
I was able to basically be honest and

5740.8 --> 5749.860000000001
reintegrate that which I was suppressing

5744.88 --> 5751.84
with with my entire being again

5749.86 --> 5754.54
to remind everybody like yeah that's

5751.84 --> 5756.639
also there that's a part of me and I

5754.54 --> 5760.06
like that's a part of me that I refuse

5756.639 --> 5762.52
to let die yeah

5760.06 --> 5765.1
I'm not letting that that part that

5762.52 --> 5767.619000000001
flame extinguish like I'm not allowing

5765.1 --> 5771.76
anybody to do that

5767.619 --> 5775.0199999999995
yeah I claim it it's mine and I will not

5771.76 --> 5775.02
relinquish it

5776.86 --> 5782.08
but in order to do that you have to

5779.38 --> 5786.900000000001
manifest it if you don't manifest it it

5782.08 --> 5786.9
disappears you don't use it it goes away

5794.92 --> 5801.06
catharsis is good for you

5796.96 --> 5801.06
yeah if you don't overdo it yeah

5826.96 --> 5829.96
huh

5828.14 --> 5832.96
[Music]

5829.96 --> 5832.96
wow

5834.639 --> 5840.6990000000005
so beautiful outside

5837.34 --> 5842.92
I just love birds leaping

5840.699 --> 5845.32
chirping in the background

5842.92 --> 5849.3
I just love that song like they all

5845.32 --> 5849.299999999999
sound so like yay

5849.4 --> 5853.78
we're free it's that time of the year

5851.92 --> 5856.08
again it's so great they're all just

5853.78 --> 5856.08
happy

5876.82 --> 5879.0599999999995
foreign

5883.119 --> 5889.54
I hope I'll be able to stay happy myself

5887.32 --> 5891.759999999999
because yeah

5889.54 --> 5893.5
financially things are getting tighter

5891.76 --> 5896.04
again

5893.5 --> 5896.04
so

5896.32 --> 5902.799999999999
I still have at least two full weeks

5899.8 --> 5905.139
I have to basically go through before I

5902.8 --> 5908.26
get my welfare money

5905.139 --> 5910.719
so I could really use the support

5908.26 --> 5912.159000000001
just gonna take this moment to do that

5910.719 --> 5914.08
sorry guys

5912.159 --> 5917.32
also I did get

5914.08 --> 5920.4
I think it's from Len Lennox

5917.32 --> 5922.84
I got a super array a PayPal yesterday

5920.4 --> 5924.04
after the show thank you very much for

5922.84 --> 5925.900000000001
that

5924.04 --> 5928.119
I don't know if is he in chat

5925.9 --> 5930.4
no I don't think so right but anyway

5928.119 --> 5932.139
thank you Lynn for the support I really

5930.4 --> 5936.099999999999
appreciate that

5932.139 --> 5940.08
like little chunks also help

5936.1 --> 5940.08
I mean a lot when you have nothing

5943.42 --> 5948.639
but yeah anybody else if you appreciate

5946.239 --> 5951.04
what I do

5948.639 --> 5952.36
or you want to at least see me keep

5951.04 --> 5954.58
going

5952.36 --> 5957.04
see where it goes what I'm gonna find

5954.58 --> 5958.9
what how am I gonna build it up what am

5957.04 --> 5961.78
I gonna spot with what other people are

5958.9 --> 5963.699
doing then please do

5961.78 --> 5968.38
seriously consider

5963.699 --> 5971.138999999999
like donating some money to PayPal to me

5968.38 --> 5974.6990000000005
through PayPal I mean

5971.139 --> 5978.28
right it's basically my email address

5974.699 --> 5980.138999999999
arwin33 gmail.com that's the PayPal

5978.28 --> 5982.179
address it's also you can also literally

5980.139 --> 5984.28
email me there if you want just private

5982.179 --> 5986.88
communication I'm not automatically

5984.28 --> 5986.88
going to

5987.34 --> 5991.659000000001
like expose what you're saying to me

5989.38 --> 5993.52
there like unless you're Sean Hawkins

5991.659 --> 5996.94
and I think it's funny

5993.52 --> 6000.0
right unless you're trolling but if you

5996.94 --> 6002.78
want private Communications I can keep

6000.0 --> 6002.78
secrets

6003.3 --> 6009.42
I mean I'm not going to like

6006.119 --> 6011.099999999999
get all blue in my mind because of your

6009.42 --> 6013.1990000000005
private situation and that I'm gonna

6011.1 --> 6015.659000000001
just blab right out anyway I don't do

6013.199 --> 6018.0
that I can absolutely keep things secret

6015.659 --> 6020.5199999999995
so you can trust me if you want a

6018.0 --> 6022.56
one-on-one communication outside of my

6020.52 --> 6026.280000000001
show here

6022.56 --> 6029.159000000001
right and some of you are

6026.28 --> 6030.96
doing that a little

6029.159 --> 6033.239
or at least you know that that's an

6030.96 --> 6035.639
option if you would ever need it somehow

6033.239 --> 6037.5
and you know maybe I will need it with

6035.639 --> 6039.119
some of you

6037.5 --> 6041.159
but anyway

6039.119 --> 6043.619
to keep it all going

6041.159 --> 6046.259999999999
I still need to get around financially

6043.619 --> 6048.36
so that I don't like run hungry or

6046.26 --> 6051.96
because then I start to stress out about

6048.36 --> 6053.699
finances and that really detracts from

6051.96 --> 6057.38
subjects that we

6053.699 --> 6057.379999999999
tend to like talking about

6057.9 --> 6063.78
and nobody wants that to happen so yeah

6061.02 --> 6066.679
that basically to countermand that

6063.78 --> 6071.04
influence I'm gonna need PayPal support

6066.679 --> 6073.86
on a regular basis to roughly get 300

6071.04 --> 6077.239
Euros together a month

6073.86 --> 6077.239
and then I will be fine

6080.04 --> 6086.0
anyway

6082.5 --> 6086.0
call my moms today

6087.119 --> 6091.28
oh right it's Mother's Day or something

6091.8 --> 6095.76
is it

6093.0 --> 6096.96
right well yeah that's unfortunately for

6095.76 --> 6098.46
me

6096.96 --> 6100.32
not really

6098.46 --> 6103.4
meaning anything but since my mother's

6100.32 --> 6103.4
been dead for a while

6104.1 --> 6109.52
maybe I call my friend the nightmare

6106.44 --> 6109.5199999999995
she is a mother

6119.76 --> 6124.38
and I'd be dropping a coin in the bucket

6122.1 --> 6125.9400000000005
that's awesome

6124.38 --> 6128.46
in a bucket

6125.94 --> 6130.0199999999995
that's hilarious like why go around with

6128.46 --> 6131.52
the platter when you could go around

6130.02 --> 6134.179
with a bucket

6131.52 --> 6134.179
it's

6134.4 --> 6140.099999999999
like please donate some dirt

6137.699 --> 6143.659
for my bucket

6140.1 --> 6143.659000000001
I appreciate that LSG

6150.38 --> 6154.34
right anyway uh

6157.02 --> 6165.080000000001
go another 20 minutes or so or more

6161.34 --> 6165.08
I am getting a bit hungry again

6167.6 --> 6171.0
oh yeah

6169.8 --> 6173.28
weird

6171.0 --> 6175.44
I was watching a bit of really old

6173.28 --> 6178.04
Doctor Who about the origin of the

6175.44 --> 6178.04
Daleks

6178.56 --> 6183.54
it's

6180.32 --> 6185.099999999999
interesting to see all Doctor Who back

6183.54 --> 6187.44
why

6185.1 --> 6188.820000000001
because it was so much about science

6187.44 --> 6191.699
fiction

6188.82 --> 6195.0599999999995
it's like the props are crappy as [ __ ]

6191.699 --> 6197.4
like ugly [ __ ] like dude

6195.06 --> 6199.7390000000005
art students these days can make better

6197.4 --> 6204.119
props during school

6199.739 --> 6205.44
right sorry maybe not but it just seems

6204.119 --> 6208.799999999999
very cheap

6205.44 --> 6210.48
but it's all about the ideas and the

6208.8 --> 6213.84
existential consequence and the

6210.48 --> 6216.54
philosophy that they really attempt to

6213.84 --> 6219.4800000000005
write the thoughts with of what's

6216.54 --> 6222.54
happening it's so sci-fi-ish that it's

6219.48 --> 6223.919999999999
not about the visuals it really is about

6222.54 --> 6226.0199999999995
the idea

6223.92 --> 6230.639
that's what made the old Doctor Who so

6226.02 --> 6234.02
strong is the the ideas

6230.639 --> 6234.02
not the graphics

6236.04 --> 6239.699
right but that's really the the old

6238.02 --> 6241.679
stuff that's what it was about that was

6239.699 --> 6243.659
with real sci-fi why what made it work

6241.679 --> 6247.08
it's even what made Star Trek the

6243.659 --> 6250.08
Original Series work because guys

6247.08 --> 6252.78
the graphics were not spectacular come

6250.08 --> 6255.08
on I mean maybe for the time being some

6252.78 --> 6257.099999999999
of the special effects were like

6255.08 --> 6259.0199999999995
revolutionary for the time being or

6257.1 --> 6261.3
something right but overall it's not

6259.02 --> 6264.06
yeah

6261.3 --> 6266.58
it kind of does look cheap now compared

6264.06 --> 6270.54
to now but

6266.58 --> 6273.659
they didn't need it because it was about

6270.54 --> 6275.46
the idea it was about what the actors

6273.659 --> 6277.86
were thinking

6275.46 --> 6280.5
what they were acting like so that it

6277.86 --> 6282.42
was made believed and then

6280.5 --> 6284.58
the visuals don't really matter anymore

6282.42 --> 6287.6990000000005
that much it's not about the visuals

6284.58 --> 6290.5199999999995
it's about the idea of it right that's

6287.699 --> 6292.5599999999995
what the real sci-fi is about and the

6290.52 --> 6296.06
older sci-fi really shows that with

6292.56 --> 6299.1
Doctor Who an old Star Trek older movies

6296.06 --> 6301.8
show it like it's about the ideas about

6299.1 --> 6303.84
thinking about oh what

6301.8 --> 6305.159000000001
what are we going to Chrome across what

6303.84 --> 6306.900000000001
type of thinking what type of

6305.159 --> 6308.46
philosophies are we going to bump into

6306.9 --> 6311.339999999999
how are we going to deal with that right

6308.46 --> 6313.5
that's

6311.34 --> 6317.1
what I really noticed about Doctor Who

6313.5 --> 6320.48
the graphics were crappy but the ideas

6317.1 --> 6320.4800000000005
were very interesting

6320.88 --> 6325.26
in ways

6322.739 --> 6329.0599999999995
not still flawed in many ways but

6325.26 --> 6329.06
interesting enough and that yeah

6329.4 --> 6334.08
Blake seven oh man you know Blake seven

6331.92 --> 6338.159
hell yeah

6334.08 --> 6341.34
yeah oh man that was a super low budget

6338.159 --> 6345.179
but it was brilliant

6341.34 --> 6349.619000000001
ship was made of a hairdryer

6345.179 --> 6352.28
yep it was so cheap but everybody was so

6349.619 --> 6356.4
into it it was brilliant

6352.28 --> 6358.5
loved Lake seven loved it especially the

6356.4 --> 6361.4
freaking box

6358.5 --> 6361.4
amazing

6365.639 --> 6371.639
I loved that series a lot

6369.36 --> 6374.0599999999995
especially when it came out or rack

6371.639 --> 6374.06
that's right

6376.44 --> 6379.159
amazing

6381.61 --> 6384.8099999999995
[Music]

6402.54 --> 6407.4
right but it worked because of the ideas

6405.179 --> 6408.96
right not because of the graphics

6407.4 --> 6412.699
necessary

6408.96 --> 6412.699
like that's secondary

6413.34 --> 6419.34
and

6415.32 --> 6421.259999999999
well when I do my game mastering with

6419.34 --> 6423.6
Dungeons and Dragons

6421.26 --> 6425.52
it's the same thing

6423.6 --> 6429.119000000001
the visuals are secondary they're

6425.52 --> 6430.9800000000005
support they're not really the important

6429.119 --> 6433.259999999999
thing the important thing is that

6430.98 --> 6435.419999999999
everybody has their character they know

6433.26 --> 6437.46
who that character is how that character

6435.42 --> 6438.9
will respond to the world they will have

6437.46 --> 6441.78
philosophies

6438.9 --> 6444.96
angle of approach philosophies for their

6441.78 --> 6447.239
character of how they are how they think

6444.96 --> 6448.9800000000005
that's it that's the most important part

6447.239 --> 6451.08
that's the thing that makes it real is

6448.98 --> 6453.839999999999
the real character in the virtual Story

6451.08 --> 6455.88
the graphics are just a side note it

6453.84 --> 6457.4400000000005
could be literal scribbles on a paper

6455.88 --> 6460.5
nobody cares

6457.44 --> 6462.419999999999
could maybe be a bit of sketches right

6460.5 --> 6465.3
but

6462.42 --> 6467.159
it's in the mind it's the idea that's

6465.3 --> 6469.139
what really makes it work that's what

6467.159 --> 6470.219
really made the story when it all

6469.139 --> 6473.4800000000005
happened

6470.219 --> 6473.4800000000005
not the graphics

6476.08 --> 6479.149
[Music]

6488.52 --> 6491.4800000000005
anyway

6494.699 --> 6499.04
I love being reminded about Blake 7.

6499.86 --> 6505.0199999999995
I always call it Blake 7. it's Blake's

6502.739 --> 6507.54
Devin right that's my mandala in fact

6505.02 --> 6510.3
I'm like no it's blake7

6507.54 --> 6512.219
doesn't make any sense it's black 7 like

6510.3 --> 6515.58
it's

6512.219 --> 6517.02
seven of nine right like that it's like

6515.58 --> 6518.94
Blake seven yeah it doesn't make any

6517.02 --> 6520.860000000001
sense now it is Blake seven there's

6518.94 --> 6522.9
seven people another Blake's crew and

6520.86 --> 6525.599999999999
I'm like yeah but it's it's Blake seven

6522.9 --> 6527.28
it just like seven

6525.6 --> 6529.860000000001
period

6527.28 --> 6532.259999999999
I don't care it's Blake's seven it is

6529.86 --> 6534.619
Blake seven because that's better sounds

6532.26 --> 6534.619000000001
better

6536.46 --> 6542.94
right it looks like bear did it

6540.78 --> 6545.58
just watch the intro to Blake said yeah

6542.94 --> 6547.44
the intro is like the early start like

6545.58 --> 6550.199
the Earth first couple of [ __ ] is like

6547.44 --> 6552.0199999999995
holy [ __ ] this is so cheap

6550.199 --> 6555.0599999999995
it's so cheap

6552.02 --> 6557.360000000001
brilliant it's hilarious how cheap it

6555.06 --> 6557.360000000001
looks

6558.239 --> 6561.739
you both Mendel had right

6563.639 --> 6568.639
I also remember it being Blake seven

6566.04 --> 6573.0
that's because you just say Blake seven

6568.639 --> 6575.04
if you have to call it blinks seven that

6573.0 --> 6577.619
literally breaks the flow of the word

6575.04 --> 6581.9
it's super annoying

6577.619 --> 6581.9
that's why I just call it Blake 7.

6584.88 --> 6589.1990000000005
right the s

6586.58 --> 6590.94
melts into the seven

6589.199 --> 6593.46
it's just Blake seven

6590.94 --> 6596.5199999999995
see that's that is a Mandela effect

6593.46 --> 6599.46
that's Mandela psychology effect

6596.52 --> 6600.84
it's very basic and I always called it

6599.46 --> 6603.659
like that

6600.84 --> 6605.76
it's just that pjc net just spelled it

6603.659 --> 6608.098999999999
correctly and immediately reminded me

6605.76 --> 6610.4400000000005
like oh [ __ ] it is called freaking

6608.099 --> 6612.659000000001
Blake's salmon isn't it no that's just

6610.44 --> 6614.28
wrong it's Blake seven I don't care if

6612.659 --> 6616.679
it makes no sense

6614.28 --> 6619.219
is how my mind sees it that's what it is

6616.679 --> 6619.219
for me

6619.38 --> 6625.56
but it is in my mind I'm not saying that

6622.08 --> 6628.44
is what it really was they changed it no

6625.56 --> 6630.659000000001
it was always just blix7

6628.44 --> 6633.919999999999
but that's not that doesn't sound right

6630.659 --> 6633.92
so just Blake seven

6637.98 --> 6644.159
you literally just watch it it's blake7

6641.76 --> 6646.34
well that might be the person in the

6644.159 --> 6646.339999999999
video

6648.48 --> 6650.78
foreign

6652.76 --> 6657.1990000000005
I mean you will find videos

6660.9 --> 6667.86
right that will say Blake seven but not

6665.28 --> 6670.46
all of them because it is really Blake

6667.86 --> 6670.46
seven

6672.54 --> 6676.98
everywhere

6673.86 --> 6679.92
they spelled it right

6676.98 --> 6683.959999999999
it's even like in the the where title

6679.92 --> 6683.96
card thing the S is there

6689.82 --> 6692.42
anyway

6700.199 --> 6703.159
yeah I

6705.3 --> 6712.4400000000005
anyway it's a Mandela influence right

6709.199 --> 6715.259999999999
the thing about the series is that

6712.44 --> 6717.178999999999
it became more

6715.26 --> 6720.2390000000005
than everybody thought it was going to

6717.179 --> 6722.82
be right because everybody was really

6720.239 --> 6724.739
inspired and basically getting into sort

6722.82 --> 6726.719
of live role-playing

6724.739 --> 6728.58
thinking out a character like one of

6726.719 --> 6733.26
these guys

6728.58 --> 6736.5599999999995
it was sort of a villain but not really

6733.26 --> 6739.1990000000005
like he is a big driving force in the

6736.56 --> 6741.42
entire series and he's really inspired

6739.199 --> 6743.28
when he does it I think he's like also

6741.42 --> 6744.78
very critical in the writing of the

6743.28 --> 6747.3
story as they went

6744.78 --> 6749.099
because it was a kind of like a a show

6747.3 --> 6753.56
where they just oh write the new episode

6749.099 --> 6753.56
do it and then live stream it

6753.78 --> 6758.04
then write the next episode and do right

6756.239 --> 6761.339999999999
that's how they went along hey Amanda

6758.04 --> 6764.219
young I haven't seen you in a long time

6761.34 --> 6765.54
I just mentioned you yesterday

6764.219 --> 6768.32
hmm

6765.54 --> 6768.32
how are you doing

6780.48 --> 6783.0199999999995
foreign

6794.599 --> 6800.96
ERS boy thanks for being here

6797.34 --> 6800.96
you enjoy your Sunday too

6802.139 --> 6809.84
you're doing great okay good to hear

6805.5 --> 6809.84
no facts damage or that kind of crap

6810.119 --> 6815.098999999999
all right yeah I'm doing fine I mean

6812.699 --> 6816.04
financially it's always yeah it's still

6815.099 --> 6817.8
the same

6816.04 --> 6820.26
[Music]

6817.8 --> 6822.719
but other than that no I'm doing great

6820.26 --> 6825.780000000001
I'm more stable

6822.719 --> 6829.08
than like I were two years ago

6825.78 --> 6831.719
or even three years ago

6829.08 --> 6834.179
and I have a lot more confidence right

6831.719 --> 6835.8
now than even I did two years ago I feel

6834.179 --> 6837.719
I have a better grip and everything than

6835.8 --> 6841.56
I did two years ago

6837.719 --> 6844.619
yeah so generally doing great

6841.56 --> 6846.84
I got me a raise ooh

6844.619 --> 6850.5
well that's

6846.84 --> 6853.9800000000005
I hope that didn't come with like a

6850.5 --> 6858.36
a price of some kind

6853.98 --> 6858.36
if not that's great congratulations

6872.58 --> 6878.5199999999995
and then he came back in the final

6874.08 --> 6881.159
episode yeah yeah I yeah I remember that

6878.52 --> 6884.159000000001
because it's fast but it's so

6881.159 --> 6885.9
fascinating that they did that PJ CNET

6884.159 --> 6889.138999999999
that they actually like the main

6885.9 --> 6891.719
character they basically did

6889.139 --> 6894.599
did it Transformers the movie Optimus

6891.719 --> 6895.9800000000005
Prime on Blake 7. right or or the other

6894.599 --> 6898.860000000001
way around because the movie was made

6895.98 --> 6899.879999999999
after but it's like yeah the main

6898.86 --> 6901.799999999999
character

6899.88 --> 6904.1990000000005
bang gone

6901.8 --> 6907.320000000001
and it still carries on and that's like

6904.199 --> 6909.9
that never happens in the series

6907.32 --> 6912.299999999999
but they did it and it kind of worked

6909.9 --> 6914.339999999999
and it was really interesting

6912.3 --> 6915.900000000001
like it still worked and that was

6914.34 --> 6919.6990000000005
amazing

6915.9 --> 6919.699
and remember that could you see that

6926.639 --> 6932.9400000000005
is the prime material playing a plane or

6929.28 --> 6934.92
a bunch of flying spheres it's all flat

6932.94 --> 6938.48
it's all flat

6934.92 --> 6938.4800000000005
the material plane is flat

6939.0 --> 6944.159
they don't elaborate onto how that works

6941.94 --> 6946.0199999999995
I think they leave it generally open to

6944.159 --> 6947.94
whoever's game mastering whether they

6946.02 --> 6949.8
want it to be on a ball

6947.94 --> 6952.199
or whether it is

6949.8 --> 6954.84
and more like enclosed

6952.199 --> 6956.4
Bubbles and it's flat inside and it

6954.84 --> 6958.619000000001
might interconnect or whatever right

6956.4 --> 6960.719
might be looping they leave that kind of

6958.619 --> 6963.0199999999995
open but effectively everything is flat

6960.719 --> 6964.56
in the indeed I could prove it

6963.02 --> 6967.6990000000005
[Music]

6964.56 --> 6967.6990000000005
I have the book

6970.739 --> 6974.098999999999
which I have showed off on many

6972.9 --> 6978.36
occasions

6974.099 --> 6979.92
right the book Manual of the planes lots

6978.36 --> 6982.88
of pictures

6979.92 --> 6982.88
total flat

6995.28 --> 6997.94
see

6998.18 --> 7001.27
[Music]

7001.76 --> 7004.2390000000005
okay

7006.219 --> 7011.96
subjective here

7009.08 --> 7014.0599999999995
additional direct picture of the the

7011.96 --> 7016.34
material plane

7014.06 --> 7020.619000000001
now the Outer Planes there is pictures

7016.34 --> 7020.619000000001
of that as soon as I can find it

7022.219 --> 7025.06
ice guard

7029.36 --> 7034.36
right

7030.5 --> 7034.36
that looks pretty damn flat

7037.82 --> 7041.32
limbo is just chaos

7047.659 --> 7054.0199999999995
yeah and now our pandemonium seems to be

7050.719 --> 7056.06
more like inside something

7054.02 --> 7057.9800000000005
but yeah that definitely does not look

7056.06 --> 7060.52
like a sphere

7057.98 --> 7060.5199999999995
[ __ ]

7062.5 --> 7066.95
damn it

7065.36 --> 7070.0689999999995

[Music]

7072.739 --> 7077.598999999999
let's just just for direct it's all

7075.32 --> 7079.219
fiction

7077.599 --> 7082.76
the abyss

7079.219 --> 7085.28
oh well yeah that looks very very flat

7082.76 --> 7088.0
and probably very very familiar to a

7085.28 --> 7088.0
whole bunch of people

7090.739 --> 7092.739
um

7093.26 --> 7097.54
foreign

7094.52 --> 7101.4400000000005
[Music]

7097.54 --> 7101.44
look at that more flat

7104.54 --> 7109.639
right it's more beautiful that way it's

7107.0 --> 7112.699
more tintillating and more real because

7109.639 --> 7115.42
Globes are [ __ ]

7112.699 --> 7115.419999999999
that's a fact

7118.099 --> 7123.56
oh the nine Hells oh that's goody

7120.739 --> 7125.799999999999
that's a lot of joy

7123.56 --> 7125.8
foreign

7126.98 --> 7129.98
s

7130.099 --> 7134.54
yeah that doesn't really look like a

7132.679 --> 7139.0
globe to me does it

7134.54 --> 7139.0
does it do you does it look like a globe

7140.3 --> 7145.06

7142.219 --> 7145.06

7160.099 --> 7164.3
and Arcadia

7162.02 --> 7168.88
it's uh yeah

7164.3 --> 7168.88
it even looks a bit rectangular looping

7170.54 --> 7173.98
sort of not really

7174.38 --> 7177.76
yeah very flat

7179.719 --> 7183.619
all right here we have a picture of

7181.46 --> 7186.38
Mount Celestia

7183.619 --> 7189.098999999999
which yeah also might look a bit

7186.38 --> 7189.099
familiar

7191.239 --> 7195.58
see see how it is and closed

7196.58 --> 7199.36
see that

7199.46 --> 7203.02
yes it's not a sphere

7210.679 --> 7214.9400000000005
wow

7213.0 --> 7217.4
[Music]

7214.94 --> 7220.638999999999
now we have Elysium

7217.4 --> 7222.86
oh look at those such a planet oh no no

7220.639 --> 7225.26
actually it's all flat

7222.86 --> 7228.159
all of it

7225.26 --> 7228.159000000001
oh if it's flat

7229.159 --> 7234.2789999999995

7231.26 --> 7234.279
[Music]

7236.32 --> 7241.04
wow another planet oh no wait no it's

7239.54 --> 7244.119
flat

7241.04 --> 7244.119
it's all flat

7251.599 --> 7257.96
oh the outlands oh well could this be a

7254.719 --> 7260.599
planet the planet oh no wait no that's

7257.96 --> 7262.94
definitely a flat disc with a giant

7260.599 --> 7265.52
Tower at the middle

7262.94 --> 7268.598999999999
hmm

7265.52 --> 7273.159000000001
yeah it's really hard to find the

7268.599 --> 7273.159000000001
sericity in the planes

7281.9 --> 7287.8589999999995
no that was it

7284.68 --> 7287.859
[Music]

7301.52 --> 7304.119000000001
foreign

7335.36 --> 7341.299999999999
how does Google Earth work uh

7339.86 --> 7345.259999999999
well

7341.3 --> 7347.119000000001
it uses the the ring mapping the

7345.26 --> 7348.26
euclidean terrain mapping which is all

7347.119 --> 7352.339999999999
flat

7348.26 --> 7355.099
then it basically shows that to you if

7352.34 --> 7357.56
you do like ground level observations if

7355.099 --> 7360.92
you then zoom out it starts to warp it

7357.56 --> 7363.219
into spherical geometry that's how they

7360.92 --> 7363.219
do it

7366.82 --> 7372.08
that's how it works it's a flat plane

7369.5 --> 7375.139
the globe model

7372.08 --> 7377.239
could not exist if they didn't have a

7375.139 --> 7380.42
flat plane

7377.239 --> 7382.879999999999
to insert into the math to make it

7380.42 --> 7386.179
spherical that's

7382.88 --> 7389.119
how the globe model works

7386.179 --> 7392.7390000000005
ah coin in the paper bucket thank you

7389.119 --> 7392.739
thank you Ellie G I'll check it out

7403.88 --> 7407.719

7405.44 --> 7409.9
that's one hell of a coin thank you very

7407.719 --> 7409.9
much

7413.0 --> 7417.22
thank you

7414.44 --> 7420.438999999999
thank you for the support man

7417.22 --> 7420.439
[Music]

7423.8 --> 7428.38
yeah that's definitely gonna help thank

7426.199 --> 7428.379999999999
you

7469.82 --> 7474.759999999999
how where do they get the imagery from

7474.8 --> 7479.78
imagery well they make them they

7477.02 --> 7481.280000000001
generate them they bend the map

7479.78 --> 7483.199
projection

7481.28 --> 7484.94
into spherical

7483.199 --> 7488.119
that's where they get it from that's not

7484.94 --> 7489.919999999999
actually what is really visible like you

7488.119 --> 7493.699
can't actually observe the globe Earth

7489.92 --> 7496.159
with your eye and see it as we typically

7493.699 --> 7498.799999999999
get to see it from a screen

7496.159 --> 7500.598999999999
because that's warped

7498.8 --> 7502.84
you see that's not an actual

7500.599 --> 7506.42
representation that's a spherical

7502.84 --> 7509.3
geometry based projection

7506.42 --> 7511.6990000000005
that is being represented it's not

7509.3 --> 7513.56
actual like you can't actually see the

7511.699 --> 7516.259999999999
Earth like that it doesn't look like

7513.56 --> 7520.280000000001
that it is in the sphere

7516.26 --> 7520.280000000001
but they can project

7520.4 --> 7527.0
the yeah what the data they have through

7523.76 --> 7529.639
mapping through scanning

7527.0 --> 7531.32
for putting euclidean map together all

7529.639 --> 7532.159000000001
that data putting it together yeah they

7531.32 --> 7535.82
can

7532.159 --> 7540.32
warp it into a sphere using spherical

7535.82 --> 7543.619
geometry but that only works because

7540.32 --> 7546.679
we base it off a flat plane right they

7543.619 --> 7548.598999999999
know the trick of how can you bend a

7546.679 --> 7551.659
flat data from a flat plane

7548.599 --> 7553.34
geometrically uniformly into as if it

7551.659 --> 7555.0199999999995
were a sphere they know how to do that

7553.34 --> 7556.6990000000005
it's an older trick

7555.02 --> 7558.56
they probably figured out during the

7556.699 --> 7560.9
Renaissance

7558.56 --> 7562.639
maybe a little bit later

7560.9 --> 7564.379999999999
and that's when they started to apply

7562.639 --> 7566.900000000001
that

7564.38 --> 7569.119
did it like even in cartography the

7566.9 --> 7572.0599999999995
people that figured out that trick

7569.119 --> 7574.579
like integrated it with cartography

7572.06 --> 7578.06
itself and that's why all maps that we

7574.579 --> 7580.579
know are all based off Global projection

7578.06 --> 7584.119000000001
right because we didn't get the full

7580.579 --> 7586.159
data they got it and then they chose not

7584.119 --> 7588.92
to share it with us anymore

7586.159 --> 7590.839999999999
stop it integrating it with maps that

7588.92 --> 7592.76
they were making at the time and instead

7590.84 --> 7594.38
turned to complete Global projection

7592.76 --> 7597.92
based Maps

7594.38 --> 7600.86
and that's the maps we have now

7597.92 --> 7603.079
right there's potentially parts that are

7600.86 --> 7604.4
not on the map even though they do exist

7603.079 --> 7606.44
in our Realm

7604.4 --> 7608.119
they're just not included in the

7606.44 --> 7609.739
projection because it's a spherical

7608.119 --> 7613.098999999999
projection

7609.739 --> 7615.199
and yeah if a person simply doesn't fit

7613.099 --> 7616.219
on that projection it's not going to be

7615.199 --> 7618.44
visible

7616.219 --> 7620.659
so there might be pieces of land or

7618.44 --> 7623.0599999999995
ocean bottom that actually exist in the

7620.659 --> 7625.219
realm that aren't included in the map

7623.06 --> 7627.7390000000005
even though they're right there

7625.219 --> 7633.82
because of the spherical projection that

7627.739 --> 7633.82
they do with the flat euclidean data

7635.89 --> 7640.56
[Music]

7641.78 --> 7645.88
it's Photoshop because it has to be yeah

7644.48 --> 7648.079
yeah

7645.88 --> 7649.46
[Music]

7648.079 --> 7652.539
ah

7649.46 --> 7652.539
[Music]

7654.679 --> 7657.86
yeah straight through his cameras on

7656.54 --> 7660.94
vehicles I know

7657.86 --> 7660.94
see them go around

7692.93 --> 7696.009
[Music]

7696.28 --> 7699.92
transitions into pictures from my

7698.3 --> 7701.78
alternate plane yeah well that's where

7699.92 --> 7704.96
yeah that's

7701.78 --> 7707.119
when you get like the oh the not mapped

7704.96 --> 7709.579
out view where you get to see the the

7707.119 --> 7712.339999999999
roads emphasize and all that on the maps

7709.579 --> 7715.639
but you go to like regular view yeah

7712.34 --> 7717.9800000000005
that's that's all airplane footage or

7715.639 --> 7720.7390000000005
like drones basically going over click

7717.98 --> 7723.259999999999
click click click and they do it every

7720.739 --> 7726.86
now and then they update

7723.26 --> 7728.659000000001
the data pool about it it's just like oh

7726.86 --> 7730.5199999999995
look here's the latest pictures from

7728.659 --> 7734.32
that in that date and then they

7730.52 --> 7734.320000000001
integrate that with the map projection

7738.679 --> 7745.88
mostly spy plane spy drone systems

7743.84 --> 7749.2390000000005
right because those are specifically

7745.88 --> 7752.3
there to get detailed data

7749.239 --> 7754.94
secretly normally well they just used

7752.3 --> 7757.76
that system to kind of scan the whole

7754.94 --> 7759.678999999999
place and integrate it with a map

7757.76 --> 7761.599
for the public

7759.679 --> 7763.4
and they probably leave some details out

7761.599 --> 7766.82
of there right they scrub things out no

7763.4 --> 7769.339999999999
no doubt they do that military things

7766.82 --> 7771.579
and all that

7769.34 --> 7771.579
foreign

7784.179 --> 7789.079
has a camera in my house has a camera my

7787.76 --> 7793.159000000001
bank has a camera

7789.079 --> 7794.84
Street camera set lightning no of course

7793.159 --> 7797.36
they don't have cameras

7794.84 --> 7800.0
I mean

7797.36 --> 7803.54
dude you know how much hassle it is

7800.0 --> 7805.94
already to put something like the ISS

7803.54 --> 7807.619
out there for a prolonged time what is

7805.94 --> 7810.94
it like in an hour a day and then they

7807.619 --> 7810.94
just keep recycling that

7811.34 --> 7815.54
yeah

7812.3 --> 7819.579000000001
like they can't just do that on the flow

7815.54 --> 7819.579
for multiple satellites

7820.3 --> 7825.679
even look they might even be able to do

7823.28 --> 7828.98
it but they could never do it perfectly

7825.679 --> 7830.659
it would always like oh

7828.98 --> 7832.94
because I even suggested it's like oh

7830.659 --> 7835.5199999999995
but just put a basic camera just a basic

7832.94 --> 7837.98
webcam in like 50 bucks

7835.52 --> 7841.76
on a camera or like on a satellite so

7837.98 --> 7844.5199999999995
they could just like me life is like oh

7841.76 --> 7847.219
I'm going to log into my satellite now

7844.52 --> 7848.780000000001
and like oh webcam go down I want to

7847.219 --> 7849.56
look there I'm gonna look there look

7848.78 --> 7851.659
there

7849.56 --> 7853.219
and just see like oh the Earth

7851.659 --> 7855.92
cool

7853.219 --> 7859.099
well they could do that

7855.92 --> 7861.079
and with basically an entire simulatory

7859.099 --> 7862.76
environment

7861.079 --> 7867.679
right

7862.76 --> 7869.780000000001
the same way like use spy plane footage

7867.679 --> 7871.9400000000005
that they use for updating the map will

7869.78 --> 7874.219
use that for

7871.94 --> 7877.159
when you turn on that cam it's just

7874.219 --> 7880.159
another simulation of the below birth

7877.159 --> 7882.138999999999
with the camera supposedly beholding

7880.159 --> 7885.579
that on the satellite

7882.139 --> 7885.579
it could all be simulated

7886.88 --> 7892.82
but it would mainly exist just before

7890.659 --> 7895.339999999999
the people that really want to believe

7892.82 --> 7897.199
that satellites are real probably

7895.34 --> 7899.599
because they

7897.199 --> 7902.239
landed a great amount of money

7899.599 --> 7903.860000000001
on it right and then you really want it

7902.239 --> 7906.199
to be real because otherwise you just

7903.86 --> 7908.36
threw away all that money

7906.199 --> 7911.9
you don't like me lied to about that so

7908.36 --> 7915.739
that would what that would be for

7911.9 --> 7918.98
but like public satellite view

7915.739 --> 7921.5199999999995
and it would just be like the ISS same

7918.98 --> 7921.5199999999995
hassle

7928.34 --> 7932.42
no satellite yeah that's right no

7930.44 --> 7935.799999999999
satellites and satellites don't exist

7932.42 --> 7935.8
they're a fictional construct

7935.84 --> 7940.159000000001
they can't have

7938.36 --> 7943.5199999999995
machines

7940.159 --> 7945.32
floating over Earth

7943.52 --> 7948.34
just like that

7945.32 --> 7948.34
that doesn't exist

7948.98 --> 7952.638999999999
and it's not necessary because the Earth

7951.32 --> 7956.54
is flat

7952.639 --> 7958.88
you don't need satellites to get reach

7956.54 --> 7962.0
you can just use Towers they can

7958.88 --> 7965.0
potentially go on forever why because

7962.0 --> 7968.179
the Earth is flat

7965.0 --> 7971.599
Earth curve is not gonna get in the way

7968.179 --> 7975.679
of your reach when you use radio towers

7971.599 --> 7977.78
so you don't need satellites because

7975.679 --> 7980.84
it's not a globe

7977.78 --> 7982.82
you could use sat balloons if you just

7980.84 --> 7984.619000000001
want it you could do it like send up a

7982.82 --> 7987.799999999999
zeppelin or a balloon

7984.619 --> 7990.199
with the satellite system on it right

7987.8 --> 7992.179
there's even footage of that being done

7990.199 --> 7993.799999999999
set loans do exist they have been

7992.179 --> 7996.26
launched multiple occasions I think

7993.8 --> 7998.78
Google's involved with that too

7996.26 --> 8001.0
so you can do that but it's just going

7998.78 --> 8002.98
to be a satellite hanging on a balloon

8001.0 --> 8006.219
it's going to be temporal and then it's

8002.98 --> 8007.959999999999
going to go down again eventually

8006.219 --> 8010.84
it's not going to stay up there forever

8007.96 --> 8012.88
that doesn't happen

8010.84 --> 8014.4400000000005
so yeah that would help with reach

8012.88 --> 8016.84
sataloon

8014.44 --> 8019.54
but in most cases you don't really need

8016.84 --> 8021.579
that I mean it becomes more useful in

8019.54 --> 8024.04
more mountainous areas right because

8021.579 --> 8026.5599999999995
Mountains will kind of block

8024.04 --> 8028.179
radio tower signals like in a valley

8026.56 --> 8030.400000000001
between mountains you're not going to

8028.179 --> 8033.159
get a signal from a radio tower

8030.4 --> 8035.92
because the mountains blocking it

8033.159 --> 8038.92
but when there's not mountains

8035.92 --> 8041.079
everywhere or you have like a connector

8038.92 --> 8044.4400000000005
a transmission

8041.079 --> 8047.5
Tower in valleys yeah then you can

8044.44 --> 8049.96
literally reach everything

8047.5 --> 8051.46
or you could just suspend the Santa Luna

8049.96 --> 8053.699
over it and then you can have reach that

8051.46 --> 8053.699
way

8054.34 --> 8056.82
right

8060.04 --> 8064.96
dude if it was necessary technically you

8062.86 --> 8067.719
could have you wouldn't even need like

8064.96 --> 8071.5
set looms you could just have cheap ass

8067.719 --> 8073.659
solar powered drones or something

8071.5 --> 8075.88
that would just fly for a period of time

8073.659 --> 8078.699
just get provide that connection until

8075.88 --> 8082.3
it kind of like runs out that's gonna

8078.699 --> 8084.219
return recharge it could do it again

8082.3 --> 8085.54
right you wouldn't even have to fill a

8084.219 --> 8088.179
balloon

8085.54 --> 8090.159
it's about the connection

8088.179 --> 8093.88
like maybe that is what starlink is

8090.159 --> 8097.42
right maybe starlink is just drones

8093.88 --> 8099.6990000000005
that are also radio connectors

8097.42 --> 8101.079
and that's it the jet that is just what

8099.699 --> 8103.419999999999
it is

8101.079 --> 8105.099
just drones not sat balloons but drones

8103.42 --> 8109.02
and they can launch it and make the

8105.099 --> 8109.02
connection and they can land again

8127.84 --> 8131.9800000000005
whatever does it say image no photo

8130.179 --> 8134.8
photo

8131.98 --> 8137.98
they can't say photo image

8134.8 --> 8141.0
images can yeah that includes pictures

8137.98 --> 8141.0
that are worked on

8141.159 --> 8147.699
there's no photos from satellites

8144.4 --> 8150.46
because a photo is unedited it's exactly

8147.699 --> 8153.879999999999
what it is it's raw data visual data

8150.46 --> 8157.86
there's no photos from satellites

8153.88 --> 8157.86
because that's impossible

8174.579 --> 8182.5199999999995
you can probably yeah no you don't know

8177.94 --> 8182.5199999999995
that it's like where the firmament

8182.56 --> 8186.6990000000005
we don't know what it is if it bounces

8184.719 --> 8188.139
things off necessarily we just know

8186.699 --> 8190.0599999999995
there's a limited amount of volume

8188.139 --> 8192.639
available

8190.06 --> 8196.0
in order for gas to find an equilibrium

8192.639 --> 8198.518999999998
in pressure within the realm

8196.0 --> 8200.5
we don't know what if there is a

8198.519 --> 8202.479
physical structure there if simply

8200.5 --> 8204.46
there's no more volume for matter to

8202.479 --> 8207.399
move into we don't know what's going on

8204.46 --> 8208.839999999998
up there what that is how it is what the

8207.399 --> 8210.88
shape is

8208.84 --> 8213.819
all we know is that there is a

8210.88 --> 8217.619999999999
limitation to the amount of volume or we

8213.819 --> 8217.619999999999
wouldn't have stable gas pressure

8230.38 --> 8233.139
you did say probably

8231.9 --> 8235.679
[Music]

8233.139 --> 8235.679
right

8240.04 --> 8246.160000000002
well they say you know oh signals

8243.399 --> 8247.719
bouncing off the ionosphere that's what

8246.16 --> 8249.519
they say now

8247.719 --> 8252.819
they haven't actually proved like oh

8249.519 --> 8256.899
yeah that's definitely just a region

8252.819 --> 8258.58
within space where it just bounces have

8256.899 --> 8259.899
they ever actually confirmed whether

8258.58 --> 8263.38
that is true after they vary to

8259.899 --> 8265.96
manipulate that factor did they go up

8263.38 --> 8269.858999999999
like Beyond

8265.96 --> 8272.858999999999
that specific layer in their sphere

8269.859 --> 8275.26
right to actually see like oh let look

8272.859 --> 8277.479000000001
Beyond oh now the radio signal just

8275.26 --> 8280.179
doesn't bounce back because it's beyond

8277.479 --> 8283.66
the ionosphere

8280.179 --> 8286.479
they ever like demonstrated any of that

8283.66 --> 8288.399
so the ionosphere just seems like an

8286.479 --> 8291.479
excuse like oh we just look something's

8288.399 --> 8295.24
bouncing off it must be some

8291.479 --> 8297.699999999999
atmospheric layer that's doing that

8295.24 --> 8300.88
okay I mean

8297.7 --> 8303.819000000001
signals regularly just bounce off plane

8300.88 --> 8305.38
Air like that right no no they don't

8303.819 --> 8307.599
never

8305.38 --> 8309.759999999998
so yeah it's highly suggested that there

8307.599 --> 8313.5
is some kind of physical

8309.76 --> 8313.5
reflection of some kind

8316.78 --> 8321.960000000001
that's what I concluded from that very

8319.179 --> 8321.960000000001
very early on

8352.3 --> 8354.899
foreign

8379.24 --> 8384.819
unless anybody had another

8382.78 --> 8387.54
thing they still wanted to say before I

8384.819 --> 8387.539999999999
round out the show

8399.1 --> 8404.640000000001
a rocket launched sound yummy

8407.38 --> 8410.099999999999
foreign

8411.24 --> 8415.38
launch in a parabolic Arc

8421.18 --> 8425.859
I'm not sure psych bear I mean there is

8423.939 --> 8428.65
like the

8425.859 --> 8431.82
what is it again

8428.65 --> 8431.82
[Music]

8433.72 --> 8437.38
let's like this go go rocket or

8436.479 --> 8441.399
something

8437.38 --> 8442.899
that where you get to see basically past

8441.399 --> 8446.38
the rocket

8442.899 --> 8448.24
down as it launches it goes pretty much

8446.38 --> 8449.699999999999
in a straight line up and then suddenly

8448.24 --> 8451.78
it's like

8449.7 --> 8454.300000000001
it halts

8451.78 --> 8456.1
and it's a mystery like why what's

8454.3 --> 8458.699999999999
really happening is that trickery what

8456.1 --> 8458.7
what is that

8459.16 --> 8465.76
that's the closest I've ever come to see

8462.399 --> 8468.22
like a rocket launch that's confirmed to

8465.76 --> 8471.0
be very straight up and not in an arc

8468.22 --> 8471.0
for a long time

8471.22 --> 8474.34
so that's it like Vera that's pretty

8473.439 --> 8477.399
much it

8474.34 --> 8478.899
but you couldn't see they didn't show

8477.399 --> 8482.8
like footage

8478.899 --> 8485.56
actually watching the rocket from from

8482.8 --> 8487.899
the ground they didn't show that you

8485.56 --> 8489.64
only saw the camera right on the rocket

8487.899 --> 8490.899
that the rocket cab that's the one you

8489.64 --> 8492.699999999999
saw

8490.899 --> 8496.38
and it was always pointing downward not

8492.7 --> 8496.380000000001
upward so I don't know

8500.68 --> 8504.220000000001
I don't know if there's other footage

8502.84 --> 8506.439
like that

8504.22 --> 8509.26
or you could literally see a rocket just

8506.439 --> 8512.380000000001
like bump into the solid barrier and

8509.26 --> 8515.62
break up like crashing into a wall

8512.38 --> 8518.46
I've never seen that before ever

8515.62 --> 8518.460000000001
and I've looked around

8525.64 --> 8528.72
the fourth wall

8551.08 --> 8553.56
hmm

8554.02 --> 8558.52
designed to the yo-yos oh right that's

8556.6 --> 8560.08
interesting psych bear it did feel like

8558.52 --> 8562.720000000001
that

8560.08 --> 8565.479
like it could have been mechanical like

8562.72 --> 8567.699999999999
like flat earthers were immediately like

8565.479 --> 8570.099999999999
even back then was it 2016 suggesting

8567.7 --> 8571.899000000001
like oh they bumped into the firmament

8570.1 --> 8577.380000000001
oh they bumped into the firm it's

8571.899 --> 8577.38
improved the proof and I'm like uh what

8582.1 --> 8587.74
not necessarily but it was weird though

8585.399 --> 8589.199999999999
the sudden stop system but if that was

8587.74 --> 8593.199999999999
literally

8589.2 --> 8595.6
engineering into it that makes sense

8593.2 --> 8598.0
I mean if it would literally crash into

8595.6 --> 8599.68
a wall to make it stop I'd imagine that

8598.0 --> 8601.78
with that velocity

8599.68 --> 8603.880000000001
it would have at least like

8601.78 --> 8605.92
gave a made it would have crashed a

8603.88 --> 8608.92
rocket

8605.92 --> 8611.92
right unless you're going to then also

8608.92 --> 8614.16
suggest oh but the firmament is flex

8611.92 --> 8619.72
with a boy

8614.16 --> 8621.64
oh really really it's that okay

8619.72 --> 8624.24
it's not like it's getting weirder and

8621.64 --> 8624.24
weirder then

8628.78 --> 8632.52
it hit a space puddle

8641.56 --> 8647.56
and stop the spin

8644.38 --> 8650.5
now but the spin did stop but as side

8647.56 --> 8653.8
bear already eluded it's very likely to

8650.5 --> 8655.78
be a system inside of the rocket that

8653.8 --> 8658.539999999999
actively does that

8655.78 --> 8661.66
so that it wasn't stopped because it was

8658.54 --> 8664.42
hitting the Doom but because it was

8661.66 --> 8667.119999999999
simply rigged to stop in that moment

8664.42 --> 8670.02
and people didn't know know that

8667.12 --> 8670.02
we're watching

8673.3 --> 8678.519999999999
these Rockets cannot stop so that's not

8676.479 --> 8680.38
true

8678.52 --> 8683.800000000001
Matthew Hall

8680.38 --> 8686.38
if there's a a counter system

8683.8 --> 8688.06
literally giving thrust in the other

8686.38 --> 8690.96
direction oh yeah you could freaking

8688.06 --> 8690.96
stop a rocket

8692.8 --> 8697.84
at least when it's going up you can I

8695.56 --> 8699.699999999999
mean when it's going down and then

8697.84 --> 8702.7
slowing it down that's a whole different

8699.7 --> 8705.819000000001
matter that's much more complicated

8702.7 --> 8709.300000000001
right but yeah you can damn well stop

8705.819 --> 8712.119999999999
like a projectile that's moving

8709.3 --> 8714.88
you can stop that you can give counter

8712.12 --> 8715.899000000001
thrust that will very quickly slow it

8714.88 --> 8719.22
down

8715.899 --> 8719.22
or de-accelerated

8753.359 --> 8758.28
engine

8754.979 --> 8758.279999999999
oh my God

8762.7 --> 8765.42
foreign

8784.899 --> 8790.199999999999
right Matthew it makes sense I know

8787.54 --> 8790.2
that's possible

8791.979 --> 8794.519999999999
foreign

8797.38 --> 8803.38
so what's blocking this Sky vacuum

8800.38 --> 8804.759999999998
in the magic gravity system

8803.38 --> 8808.479
all that

8804.76 --> 8811.06
well what's stopping it is

8808.479 --> 8812.88
the assumption that gas doesn't expand

8811.06 --> 8815.439
in all directions because it's

8812.88 --> 8817.96
reclassified and ignored

8815.439 --> 8820.899
into a fluid

8817.96 --> 8823.119999999999
so that you just stop asking the

8820.899 --> 8824.56
question like no it's not expanding in

8823.12 --> 8827.740000000002
all directions because we're not going

8824.56 --> 8830.92
to think of it as a as a fluid as a gas

8827.74 --> 8833.859
you're going to think of it as a fluid

8830.92 --> 8838.12
and kind of ignore gas behavior and then

8833.859 --> 8840.640000000001
it works out in the model that's how

8838.12 --> 8843.1
that's how gravity keeps the gas in

8840.64 --> 8845.26
because gas doesn't expand in all

8843.1 --> 8847.12
directions anymore because it's ignored

8845.26 --> 8850.0
that it is a gas and instead

8847.12 --> 8852.52
reclassified as a fluid and that's how

8850.0 --> 8855.22
they do it

8852.52 --> 8857.26
and all it requires is a little suspense

8855.22 --> 8860.34
of disbelief

8857.26 --> 8860.34
and it all works

8867.7 --> 8870.58
gravity is not a force you'll need a

8869.38 --> 8873.119999999999
force

8870.58 --> 8873.12
whatever

8874.72 --> 8879.34
I'm just talking about how it's designed

8877.06 --> 8880.66
now if gravity is supposedly not even a

8879.34 --> 8883.0
force anymore

8880.66 --> 8885.1
yeah that doesn't make it designed

8883.0 --> 8887.38
differently it was still designed that

8885.1 --> 8889.720000000001
way oh it's not a force that's cute it

8887.38 --> 8892.3
was designed the model with gravity

8889.72 --> 8895.06
being a force Newtonian Style

8892.3 --> 8896.92
that cannot be undone because it's

8895.06 --> 8899.319
literally the glue holding the model

8896.92 --> 8901.78
together doesn't matter if it's not

8899.319 --> 8904.14
relevant anymore it's the glue holding

8901.78 --> 8904.140000000001
it together

8911.859 --> 8914.859
foreign

8923.74 --> 8930.28
dude Ballers that are invoking gravity

8926.64 --> 8932.5
literally literally are unable to

8930.28 --> 8936.960000000001
understand what it is or they would

8932.5 --> 8936.96
never believe in it like that

8937.3 --> 8942.399
so take our front demo but gravity is

8939.58 --> 8945.22
not a force with all that it's like it's

8942.399 --> 8947.92
relevant to a gravity believer it's not

8945.22 --> 8950.5
relevant to a globe believer

8947.92 --> 8952.06
it's all out of whack as soon as you

8950.5 --> 8953.68
remind them they literally have no

8952.06 --> 8956.199999999999
nothing to stand on is that what you

8953.68 --> 8958.12
want to do you just wanna

8956.2 --> 8959.439
just destroy their belief just destroy

8958.12 --> 8960.76
their belief like you're you can't

8959.439 --> 8962.439
believe it's wrong you can't believe

8960.76 --> 8965.34
it's wrong you can't believe it is wrong

8962.439 --> 8965.34
or

8965.5 --> 8970.0
it just explained to them how the model

8968.08 --> 8971.859
works

8970.0 --> 8977.14
so they can

8971.859 --> 8980.439
learn to deal with what they believe in

8977.14 --> 8981.279999999999
right just like you fall in love with a

8980.439 --> 8985.06
girl

8981.28 --> 8987.399000000001
then you get to know her because you

8985.06 --> 8988.66
don't know her at the beginning because

8987.399 --> 8991.18
you're in love

8988.66 --> 8993.34
once you get to know her then you can

8991.18 --> 8995.5
decide what to do

8993.34 --> 8997.72
really on the long run

8995.5 --> 9000.6
what you can build on right

8997.72 --> 9002.64
so if they only get to understand how

9000.6 --> 9006.12
the globe model works from a globe

9002.64 --> 9008.58
believer perspective then they get to

9006.12 --> 9010.92
truly know what they believe in

9008.58 --> 9016.56
and then they can read they can on their

9010.92 --> 9020.22
own time redecide how to approach it all

9016.56 --> 9022.68
yeah I mean Globe model it's a model

9020.22 --> 9025.199999999999
it's like a really hot girl

9022.68 --> 9027.12
that's really unreliable and that wants

9025.2 --> 9030.479000000001
to enslave you

9027.12 --> 9033.479000000001
you'll fall in love with that oh yeah

9030.479 --> 9035.22
but if you just surrender your mind to

9033.479 --> 9037.438999999998
it and you don't investigate what's

9035.22 --> 9039.66
actually there then

9037.439 --> 9042.300000000001
yeah you're just gonna be dumber and

9039.66 --> 9044.34
dumber and dumber every time Dumber

9042.3 --> 9047.519999999999
every time until you're like so [ __ ]

9044.34 --> 9051.359
dumb that even clinical [ __ ] people

9047.52 --> 9053.52
will look down upon you with like wow

9051.359 --> 9056.7
that's really dumb

9053.52 --> 9060.359
okay that's what's gonna happen

9056.7 --> 9063.479000000001
if you get to actually learn the model

9060.359 --> 9066.12
understand what it is how it was built

9063.479 --> 9068.88
up the history behind it all and the

9066.12 --> 9070.08
psychology that it was trying to play

9068.88 --> 9072.179999999998
into

9070.08 --> 9074.039999999999
its construction

9072.18 --> 9076.319
and you truly get to know what you

9074.04 --> 9080.04
believe in and then you can reassess

9076.319 --> 9083.519999999999
your position from an honest knowing

9080.04 --> 9085.26
perspective on your own time like you

9083.52 --> 9086.7
that that's not going to work itself out

9085.26 --> 9089.64
while you're in the middle of people

9086.7 --> 9091.439
that are very opinionated

9089.64 --> 9093.08
and have to figure that out in your own

9091.439 --> 9097.14
time and it starts with actually

9093.08 --> 9100.34
understanding what it is you believe it

9097.14 --> 9100.34
right just a tip

9103.54 --> 9108.899000000001
[Music]

9106.979 --> 9111.019999999999
I'm talking to the ball Believers right

9108.899 --> 9111.019999999999
now

9111.12 --> 9113.960000000001
it's all right

9114.62 --> 9119.939
natonian habits right just immediately

9117.66 --> 9122.28
just swipe them out it's just the war

9119.939 --> 9124.319
mentality it's like oh bull believer

9122.28 --> 9127.68
swipe them off their feet immediately

9124.319 --> 9130.619999999999
Crush their skulls immediately like but

9127.68 --> 9134.04
but I just wanted to know why you

9130.62 --> 9137.28
believe the Flat Earth that's right uh

9134.04 --> 9139.859
not all of them are soldiers

9137.28 --> 9143.819000000001
not all of them are anti-flat earthers

9139.859 --> 9145.979000000001
do keep your senses about you

9143.819 --> 9148.14
so you can learn

9145.979 --> 9149.76
when it's a genuine globe or that just

9148.14 --> 9151.92
has a belief and they're basically

9149.76 --> 9154.02
innocent or when

9151.92 --> 9155.64
they're at anti-flat earther and they've

9154.02 --> 9157.979000000001
already heard me

9155.64 --> 9160.74
their responses and they're just there

9157.979 --> 9163.619999999999
to try and negate The Logical

9160.74 --> 9166.5
consistency

9163.62 --> 9168.060000000001
of our thinking right so they're not

9166.5 --> 9170.88
interested in what is the truth they're

9168.06 --> 9174.24
only interested in breaking our grip

9170.88 --> 9176.88
over the truth that's an anti-flat

9174.24 --> 9179.28
earther Ballers don't do that

9176.88 --> 9182.64
anti-flat earthers do that

9179.28 --> 9184.979000000001
they knew they learned and then they

9182.64 --> 9187.979
doubled down

9184.979 --> 9190.92
and they're obsessed all they want is

9187.979 --> 9194.399
for us to stop understanding what we're

9190.92 --> 9196.74
doing so then they can finally let it go

9194.399 --> 9198.72
that's the the process that's going on

9196.74 --> 9200.52
all they want is for us to be [ __ ]

9198.72 --> 9202.74
like them so they don't have to feel

9200.52 --> 9205.68
that stupid anymore

9202.74 --> 9207.07
that's all that's what anti-flatterers

9205.68 --> 9210.129
do

9207.07 --> 9210.128999999999
[Music]

9218.22 --> 9223.979
yep yes Matthew Hall understanding right

9222.06 --> 9225.779999999999
if you don't understand something then

9223.979 --> 9229.92
how can you

9225.78 --> 9232.02
make a good decision about it right

9229.92 --> 9235.02
you have to understand it first not just

9232.02 --> 9237.720000000001
oh I love it so much it's so special oh

9235.02 --> 9239.640000000001
the east or the Easter yeah people are

9237.72 --> 9241.8
falling in love with ether now

9239.64 --> 9244.319
so beautiful oh look at all these

9241.8 --> 9247.319
magical things and Technology like all

9244.319 --> 9249.859
these patterns that it has to be or

9247.319 --> 9249.859
either

9251.64 --> 9256.38
yeah they have to do it right

9254.34 --> 9258.18
but it's like acting like they're in

9256.38 --> 9259.92
love they're not actually trying to

9258.18 --> 9261.479000000001
really figure out what it is they're

9259.92 --> 9262.68
doing and what it is that they believe

9261.479 --> 9264.24
in

9262.68 --> 9266.720000000001
because they're just chasing another

9264.24 --> 9266.72
dream

9267.12 --> 9270.78
it's like behavior of when you're in

9268.92 --> 9272.76
love you don't really pay attention in

9270.78 --> 9276.66
that face you're just like really

9272.76 --> 9278.16
enjoying it while it lasts

9276.66 --> 9281.1
anyway

9278.16 --> 9283.68
settle down Landenberg

9281.1 --> 9286.26
yeah he's a real etherean

9283.68 --> 9287.76
for sure he's been in ethereum for a

9286.26 --> 9290.939
long time by the way he's like

9287.76 --> 9293.16
championing ether techno babble

9290.939 --> 9296.76
or as far back as I can remember him

9293.16 --> 9298.979
which is like five years six years he's

9296.76 --> 9300.899
been doing that very enthusiastically

9298.979 --> 9304.199999999999
from the start

9300.899 --> 9309.619999999999
so he was always in ethereum one of the

9304.2 --> 9309.62
first ethereans that I knew right anyway

9310.859 --> 9314.460000000001
every appearance he makes he tries

9312.78 --> 9316.74
that's right

9314.46 --> 9319.259999999998
anyway I am gonna round out the show now

9316.74 --> 9322.5
been over two and a half hours pretty

9319.26 --> 9324.24
good show very all over the place bitter

9322.5 --> 9326.52
rage win

9324.24 --> 9330.66
Limited

9326.52 --> 9333.66
Flat Earth stuff mechanics

9330.66 --> 9337.56
a lot yeah a bit of old Sci-Fi series

9333.66 --> 9339.899
talk showed some maps in Dungeons and

9337.56 --> 9341.699999999999
Dragons and how they're all flat because

9339.899 --> 9345.0
they knew

9341.7 --> 9346.92
they still know it is flat

9345.0 --> 9347.939
because it doesn't make any sense if it
