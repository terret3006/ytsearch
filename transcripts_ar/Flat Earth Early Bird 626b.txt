4.799 --> 8.96
and

5.279 --> 12.559000000000001
welcome back to the early bird show

8.96 --> 15.839
number 626 it's the second part

12.559 --> 19.68
because my internet broke so i hope

15.839 --> 19.68
you are still out there

19.92 --> 26.160000000000004
uh yeah

23.439 --> 31.039
i had to basically reset everything so

26.16 --> 35.04
it took some time

31.039 --> 37.68
uh what was i yapping about

35.04 --> 38.559
anyway let's yeah wait for everybody to

37.68 --> 45.84
get back in

38.559 --> 45.839999999999996
hey mazar salim welcome back

50.96 --> 59.84
amanda young

63.51 --> 66.689
[Music]

70.84 --> 76.61
whew

73.3 --> 76.61
[Music]

94.079 --> 101.6
uh good servant yo

97.92 --> 104.479
welcome back

101.6 --> 107.52
uh i don't yeah i completely lost what i

104.479 --> 107.52
was talking about now

112.84 --> 115.84
brilliant

126.84 --> 129.84
uh

140.239 --> 143.44
technically i could watch the episode

142.239 --> 157.84
back to think

143.44 --> 157.84
what i was talking about

158.8 --> 163.28
huh okay mother salim

164.48 --> 168.23899999999998
flat earther claims we cannot conclude

166.56 --> 171.44
anything without

168.239 --> 174.879
oh anything through observations alone

171.44 --> 177.76
without experimentation well

174.879 --> 180.239
what is experimentation if that means

177.76 --> 181.67999999999998
without scientific experimentation well

180.239 --> 186.56
that's

181.68 --> 189.36
that's ridiculous it's just logic

186.56 --> 191.44
but if it means without physically

189.36 --> 195.59900000000002
interacting in some way

191.44 --> 197.28
in order to solidify or disprove

195.599 --> 199.04
the conclusions drawn from the

197.28 --> 202.4
observations then

199.04 --> 204.0
yeah he has a point if you're just

202.4 --> 207.84
looking and you're not

204.0 --> 207.84
trying to confirm it physically

208.159 --> 211.519
you know you don't have to find the

210.08 --> 214.48000000000002
origin

211.519 --> 216.239
but yeah for example with the celestial

214.48 --> 219.51899999999998
bodies

216.239 --> 221.76
you know you can have the observation

219.519 --> 223.28
but if you're not gonna falsified in

221.76 --> 225.44
some way like

223.28 --> 227.599
for example like okay you want to assume

225.44 --> 228.959
they are physical objects well proof of

227.599 --> 232.64
proximity

228.959 --> 235.84
approach yet then and let's see

232.64 --> 238.879
if yeah the natural laws of physicality

235.84 --> 243.04
will reveal themselves

238.879 --> 243.04
through that empirical process

243.12 --> 249.159
you know that's not what astrophysicians

246.72 --> 252.159
are physicists physicians

249.159 --> 252.159
astrophysicians

253.599 --> 260.079
space doctors yeah that's what

256.88 --> 260.079
astrophysician would be

260.32 --> 269.68
right astrophysicist that's what they do

264.4 --> 269.67999999999995
just calculate and stick with the

280.84 --> 283.84
presuppositions

303.039 --> 306.24
natural laws don't go go through

304.8 --> 309.44
experimentations

306.24 --> 310.08
no no they do they just don't go through

309.44 --> 314.479
scientific

310.08 --> 316.71999999999997
experimentation but you definitely

314.479 --> 317.75899999999996
that's the whole point about a natural

316.72 --> 321.52000000000004
law is basically

317.759 --> 325.52000000000004
okay we've concluded through everything

321.52 --> 327.039
all the testing all the testing we could

325.52 --> 330.24
figure out that this

327.039 --> 331.919
always happens like

330.24 --> 333.759
gas pressure expanding within the

331.919 --> 336.4
container to find the gas pressure

333.759 --> 339.44
equilibrium

336.4 --> 342.479
falls under natural law

339.44 --> 343.28
okay that's not been concluded without

342.479 --> 345.68
some form of

343.28 --> 348.15999999999997
experimentation i promise you but it's

345.68 --> 350.8
not scientific experimentation because

348.16 --> 350.8
that doesn't

350.84 --> 356.08
apply

352.56 --> 359.12
sure people probably have tried

356.08 --> 359.84
but that just doesn't work out this is a

359.12 --> 363.759
natural law

359.84 --> 365.039
natural law is so so universal so

363.759 --> 368.47900000000004
obvious

365.039 --> 370.71999999999997
through all testing of things

368.479 --> 374.15999999999997
that it basically presents okay can you

370.72 --> 374.16
prove to the contrary

374.88 --> 380.4
and yeah that's going to be unfathomable

378.84 --> 383.84
basically

380.4 --> 386.96
because nobody knows how to contradict

383.84 --> 389.67999999999995
natural laws if they could

386.96 --> 390.96
then they wouldn't be natural laws but

389.68 --> 393.28000000000003
you can't just

390.96 --> 394.08
claim that without showing some actual

393.28 --> 397.59999999999997
evidence some

394.08 --> 397.59999999999997
physical evidence of that

399.44 --> 409.84
all right mozarelli

425.44 --> 429.44
right i think that technically you could

428.24 --> 432.72
say that you can

429.44 --> 435.84
use natural laws

432.72 --> 436.72
to claim the cause of an effect in an

435.84 --> 440.88
experiment

436.72 --> 444.72
though but you can't

440.88 --> 451.84
prove the natural laws themselves

444.72 --> 451.84000000000003
with an experiment that's the difference

456.0 --> 465.84
i hope i got that correct i think i do

471.28 --> 478.79999999999995
oh i meant that don't worry look if my

475.12 --> 481.759
stream just goes down like that

478.8 --> 483.68
unless it's like at the hour mark or

481.759 --> 485.36
something when my show is supposed to be

483.68 --> 487.199
ending anyway

485.36 --> 489.199
then i'm usually always gonna restart

487.199 --> 492.0
the stream and it's not gonna take

489.199 --> 495.44
longer than 10 minutes max

492.0 --> 498.639
unless like the power goes out yeah then

495.44 --> 503.759
then it's just done but

498.639 --> 503.759
yeah that doesn't happen very often

504.4 --> 511.84
or really never like

507.759 --> 514.32
no uh no blackouts or brownouts

511.84 --> 515.519
like that luckily the the electric may

514.32 --> 519.36
uh

515.519 --> 521.279
may fail then temporarily

519.36 --> 524.8000000000001
but like not in the city or anything

521.279 --> 524.8
there's no real blackout so

528.56 --> 535.279
do you think the sun itself is hot

532.839 --> 538.399
well it's a

535.279 --> 540.399
it's a trick question really

538.399 --> 542.56
if you think about it because what is

540.399 --> 544.48
the sun it's light it's

542.56 --> 546.56
a light apparition it's something you

544.48 --> 549.6
see there

546.56 --> 552.0
it does give off its own light and that

549.6 --> 555.44
light definitely contains heat

552.0 --> 558.8
so is that light apparition

555.44 --> 562.5600000000001
hot well

558.8 --> 567.8389999999999
yeah probably

562.56 --> 571.279
but is it a really is it like radiating

567.839 --> 574.839
is it an object that radiates it

571.279 --> 578.24
no it's more like it is the light you

574.839 --> 581.839
see a side effect of that light

578.24 --> 581.839
that is coming towards you from that

588.839 --> 591.839
direction

595.12 --> 598.32
but anyway yeah heat you can only really

597.839 --> 601.9200000000001
even

598.32 --> 604.6400000000001
detect heat by yeah

601.92 --> 605.76
from light by the light being absorbed

604.64 --> 609.36
in material

605.76 --> 613.4399999999999
anyway so the real heat from an

609.36 --> 616.88
from the sun from the light itself

613.44 --> 619.7600000000001
is always absorbed well at ground level

616.88 --> 622.399
where matter will absorb it it's not

619.76 --> 622.399
transparent

630.0 --> 633.44
daylight is hot maybe i don't know good

632.88 --> 646.079
servant

633.44 --> 649.0400000000001
i don't know if it is

646.079 --> 649.04
not sure about that

651.36 --> 655.04
you know during the winter there is

653.12 --> 661.68
plenty of daylight

655.04 --> 675.8389999999999
and it's not warm so

661.68 --> 675.8389999999999
but it is light

683.92 --> 689.8389999999999
ah getting sick right

687.36 --> 689.839
uh

696.56 --> 700.8389999999999
i don't know about that getting sick

698.64 --> 702.0
theorizing about how the atmosphere was

700.839 --> 704.5600000000001
created

702.0 --> 705.2
but yeah you're assuming it's going to

704.56 --> 709.1999999999999
be made

705.2 --> 711.9200000000001
from the earth basically could be

709.2 --> 712.5600000000001
but i think it it yeah i don't think

711.92 --> 715.04
that was all

712.56 --> 716.7199999999999
naturally formed you know i think it was

715.04 --> 719.68
really

716.72 --> 720.48
a direct altering influence that

719.68 --> 723.68
basically

720.48 --> 728.8000000000001
manifested it in ways or yeah

723.68 --> 728.8
drew it in during creation

728.839 --> 735.2
so i don't know i think maybe

731.92 --> 738.8
just air and who knows maybe

735.2 --> 741.0400000000001
air is much easier transmutable

738.8 --> 743.04
just change it directly into another

741.04 --> 746.079
type of air

743.04 --> 747.279
for the creator for that avatar thing

746.079 --> 750.6389999999999
that he was

747.279 --> 753.8389999999999
during creation the elohim

750.639 --> 756.639
then yeah then

753.839 --> 757.2
yeah we might be able to attain so i

756.639 --> 759.12
don't know

757.2 --> 761.0400000000001
you know when you consider that

759.12 --> 764.9590000000001
transmutation is even

761.04 --> 767.5999999999999
potentially within our mere mortal

764.959 --> 768.959
reach then yeah god would be able to

767.6 --> 771.0400000000001
utilize that

768.959 --> 773.8389999999999
maximum efficiency probably with

771.04 --> 773.8389999999999
anything

782.639 --> 789.44
is it possible

786.639 --> 792.48
right we'd be bent into different

789.44 --> 792.48
species what

798.839 --> 803.2
no

800.56 --> 803.1999999999999
not really

803.839 --> 808.0
we could be altered through

806.48 --> 810.8000000000001
cross-breeding perhaps you

808.0 --> 813.04
just look at dogs what's out there yeah

810.8 --> 815.279
that used to be a wolf

813.04 --> 816.88
so yeah we can definitely alter but it's

815.279 --> 818.399
going to be within the genetic

816.88 --> 822.32
parameters

818.399 --> 824.48
that is allotted to our design

822.32 --> 826.8000000000001
because if you get outside if you

824.48 --> 843.839
actually mutate

826.8 --> 843.8389999999999
it's gonna break the cycle

853.92 --> 859.5999999999999
no no it can't matter asleep

857.519 --> 861.04
it's absurd i've addressed that a couple

859.6 --> 864.48
of times

861.04 --> 866.16
a week ago or something no

864.48 --> 868.5600000000001
with the amount of outer space they're

866.16 --> 871.76
supposed to be there

868.56 --> 875.279
just overlooking even that it's

871.76 --> 878.959
infinitely expanding yeah that means

875.279 --> 881.279
infinite amount of gas because

878.959 --> 882.4799999999999
the power of gas pressure expansion with

881.279 --> 886.32
the container

882.48 --> 889.12
through boyle's law is directly linked

886.32 --> 889.9200000000001
into the amount of volume available for

889.12 --> 893.92
it to

889.92 --> 894.24
expand into so infinite amount of room

893.92 --> 898.24
for

894.24 --> 903.6800000000001
gas to expense into means infinite

898.24 --> 906.9590000000001
force the earth would have to be

903.68 --> 910.0
yeah a a giant

906.959 --> 912.56
gas creating

910.0 --> 914.32
white hole you know for when it compared

912.56 --> 915.2399999999999
to science fiction it would just be

914.32 --> 918.32
constantly

915.24 --> 920.32
exploding powerful amounts of gas in all

918.32 --> 923.36
directions

920.32 --> 925.1990000000001
yeah in order to even get

923.36 --> 926.88
close to some kind of gas pressure

925.199 --> 928.639
equilibrium at the surface but that

926.88 --> 931.6
makes no sense because it would all be

928.639 --> 933.6
rushing off at the insane speeds

931.6 --> 936.48
despite the amount that's being made

933.6 --> 941.839
literally to fill the entire galaxy

936.48 --> 941.839
so makes no sense

942.88 --> 947.6
is there a mathematical equation for

944.8 --> 947.5999999999999
entropy no

950.959 --> 955.199
no not that i care of anyway i don't

953.279 --> 956.0
know you know it depends on what you're

955.199 --> 958.7199999999999
talking about

956.0 --> 968.399
boyle's law is mathematical

958.72 --> 983.839
mathematically expressible

968.399 --> 983.839
entropy is kind of a wide terminology

1000.0 --> 1005.199
anyway thanks for the questions uh mazar

1002.48 --> 1007.12
slim i appreciate that

1005.199 --> 1008.4799999999999
even though i might be like hey that's a

1007.12 --> 1010.32
stupid question and then

1008.48 --> 1012.0
like oh yeah but i'm just should be

1010.32 --> 1014.399
happy that somebody's at least asking a

1012.0 --> 1014.399
question

1014.88 --> 1018.88
that's good no that's technically what

1018.079 --> 1021.7589999999999
i'm here for

1018.88 --> 1023.36
i try to feel it just me rambling and

1021.759 --> 1026.16
picking up something and then talking

1023.36 --> 1030.0
about it for as long as i can

1026.16 --> 1033.76
that's much relevant or valuable

1030.0 --> 1033.76
data tied into it that i can

1035.52 --> 1040.16
but yeah i'm up for questions if it's

1038.48 --> 1053.84
serious

1040.16 --> 1053.8400000000001
any time

1082.96 --> 1086.16
uh why are you saying that mark collard

1084.799 --> 1086.799
we could have all left this realm

1086.16 --> 1089.039
yesterday

1086.799 --> 1089.039
why

1090.48 --> 1095.84
what happened

1098.08 --> 1109.84
want me to explain looping

1101.84 --> 1109.84
you mean looping space

1112.32 --> 1116.72
right well yeah if you really want to

1114.72 --> 1118.96
keep it basic then

1116.72 --> 1120.24
there's certain video games that just

1118.96 --> 1122.96
have looping

1120.24 --> 1125.039
effects like even back in the day when

1122.96 --> 1128.32
games were pretty primitive

1125.039 --> 1131.44
it was just very easy you just have

1128.32 --> 1133.9189999999999
a game grid usually 2d back in the day

1131.44 --> 1137.28
right so you have a game grid

1133.919 --> 1140.48
and then either you say okay you after

1137.28 --> 1142.96
this this part you can't go any further

1140.48 --> 1146.24
there's like a barrier so you just

1142.96 --> 1147.2
your sprite your character can't move

1146.24 --> 1150.32
there

1147.2 --> 1153.44
because it stops it or it just

1150.32 --> 1155.6789999999999
loops onto the other side

1153.44 --> 1158.76
and they could even fool around with

1155.679 --> 1161.679
that by making the camera

1158.76 --> 1164.08
character-centric and then just make him

1161.679 --> 1166.0800000000002
walk the same board continually

1164.08 --> 1167.1999999999998
the same part over and over again and

1166.08 --> 1170.24
you could upward

1167.2 --> 1171.919
looping into the same thing diagonal

1170.24 --> 1174.64
you know there were all these kinds of

1171.919 --> 1178.0800000000002
games that had that because it's so

1174.64 --> 1182.48
basic to do it's so simple

1178.08 --> 1184.72
so that is yeah maybe an easier way to

1182.48 --> 1186.24
conceptualize the concept of looping

1184.72 --> 1190.08
space

1186.24 --> 1193.52
looping space exists within

1190.08 --> 1196.48
a spatially limited confine

1193.52 --> 1198.72
where there simply is no more physical

1196.48 --> 1203.28
space

1198.72 --> 1203.28
beyond a certain length

1203.52 --> 1210.24
like this amount of space and no more

1207.36 --> 1210.799
how do you know well because after this

1210.24 --> 1213.6
length

1210.799 --> 1215.44
it literally loops in on itself so

1213.6 --> 1217.28
that's the length of it

1215.44 --> 1218.799
you know ballers love to think of that

1217.28 --> 1224.08
sort of thing as

1218.799 --> 1227.28
the circumference but yeah it's all flat

1224.08 --> 1230.0
right so if there is a loop

1227.28 --> 1231.12
there's definitely if there's a loop it

1230.0 --> 1234.64
is definitely

1231.12 --> 1238.2399999999998
easy to west certainty

1234.64 --> 1240.4
that's where you really begin to find

1238.24 --> 1240.4
it

1244.0 --> 1248.08
that's also yeah to to display it it's

1246.88 --> 1252.0800000000002
the easiest and

1248.08 --> 1257.28
as square earth cosmology

1252.08 --> 1257.28
has animations that show you just that

1260.4 --> 1265.679
rectangular looping well that's

1262.88 --> 1268.64
rectangular would be the

1265.679 --> 1271.3600000000001
how i size up the spatial confine of the

1268.64 --> 1271.3600000000001
realm would be

1274.84 --> 1281.1999999999998
roughly

1277.039 --> 1283.679
because hey now with the map

1281.2 --> 1287.1200000000001
the typical map uh hold on now let's get

1283.679 --> 1287.1200000000001
some pictures in there maybe

1288.24 --> 1295.76
dig in there but the typical

1291.36 --> 1295.76
yeah the i don't i forgot the name

1297.919 --> 1301.8400000000001
sorry guys it's still very hot in here

1302.64 --> 1305.8400000000001
where's that thing

1306.0 --> 1319.84
all right there you go

1325.28 --> 1331.6
this well this thing here

1329.12 --> 1333.6789999999999
basically the known confine projected in

1331.6 --> 1338.32
a

1333.679 --> 1338.3200000000002
yeah in a as literal fashion as you can

1339.36 --> 1345.28
is kind of rectangular

1342.799 --> 1346.1589999999999
that's one of the first things i noticed

1345.28 --> 1348.8799999999999
now i'm very

1346.159 --> 1350.5590000000002
open that maybe there's more segments to

1348.88 --> 1354.24
the north and the south more realm

1350.559 --> 1358.6399999999999
segments or other realms

1354.24 --> 1361.2
that may be conditionally accessible

1358.64 --> 1362.4
maybe periodically or maybe

1361.2 --> 1365.919
conditionally

1362.4 --> 1368.159
i don't know might be very complex

1365.919 --> 1369.3600000000001
might not just be as easy as oh you just

1368.159 --> 1373.2800000000002
go over there you know

1369.36 --> 1376.3999999999999
sometimes it might be but sometimes it

1373.28 --> 1379.36
may simply be impossible to get there

1376.4 --> 1379.3600000000001
even if you tried

1380.24 --> 1383.76
not saying that you would be shot down

1382.4 --> 1385.76
or something like that

1383.76 --> 1388.4
it's easy to imagine that but maybe

1385.76 --> 1391.2
simply the barrier just closes

1388.4 --> 1392.0800000000002
you just bump into it if you try to go

1391.2 --> 1395.2
there

1392.08 --> 1397.9189999999999
and then other times it's not there just

1395.2 --> 1400.24
yeah it just isn't there's just a

1397.919 --> 1403.8400000000001
continual pathway further

1400.24 --> 1403.84
who knows

1409.44 --> 1411.8400000000001
anyway

1413.76 --> 1417.84
hope that explains

1418.96 --> 1421.1200000000001
this

1424.32 --> 1430.6599999999999
[ __ ] is that this is getting out of here

1428.84 --> 1433.8999999999999
dumbass

1430.66 --> 1433.9
[Music]

1441.6 --> 1445.84
how the loop would work mechanically

1446.0 --> 1452.559
what the mechanics of space itself

1449.44 --> 1453.29
of looping space no i have no freaking

1452.559 --> 1455.039
idea

1453.29 --> 1457.6789999999999
[Music]

1455.039 --> 1460.72
you know yeah you could probably science

1457.679 --> 1464.24
fiction the [ __ ] out of that

1460.72 --> 1467.6000000000001
but i'm just gonna resort to

1464.24 --> 1471.039
the yeah an idea that says

1467.6 --> 1472.0
yeah i think god the creator probably

1471.039 --> 1476.32
figured it out and

1472.0 --> 1479.12
utilized it because i would

1476.32 --> 1480.8799999999999
as a designer it's very convenient i

1479.12 --> 1482.8799999999999
explained this many times with my

1480.88 --> 1486.0800000000002
rectangular looping flat earth

1482.88 --> 1489.2
hangouts even back in the day

1486.08 --> 1491.6789999999999
i don't know how it works though i don't

1489.2 --> 1495.6000000000001
really care i don't really want a

1491.679 --> 1500.5590000000002
loopy loop [ __ ] you know i don't want

1495.6 --> 1503.279
overkill magic world i don't

1500.559 --> 1504.72
it's not a good idea you know it's a

1503.279 --> 1507.6
good idea in games

1504.72 --> 1508.799
it's very fun very fun to blow

1507.6 --> 1511.6
everything up with

1508.799 --> 1512.8799999999999
with lightning bolts and exploding

1511.6 --> 1515.1999999999998
fireballs and [ __ ]

1512.88 --> 1517.6000000000001
but yeah in physical reality i'd like to

1515.2 --> 1520.4
keep things kind of

1517.6 --> 1520.3999999999999
down to earth

1521.84 --> 1526.3999999999999
because it's just not healthy to to

1524.159 --> 1528.72
literalize that sort of [ __ ]

1526.4 --> 1530.159
it's for the imagination not for the

1528.72 --> 1532.96
physical world

1530.159 --> 1532.96
in my opinion

1534.64 --> 1539.919
so yeah even things like teleportation

1538.88 --> 1543.3600000000001
and all that you know this

1539.919 --> 1544.96
just just look in what science fiction

1543.36 --> 1549.279
and star trek

1544.96 --> 1556.4
alone just showed with it the dangers

1549.279 --> 1559.52
it's insane to have something like that

1556.4 --> 1562.88
yeah yeah

1559.52 --> 1562.8799999999999
it's just not a good idea

1563.36 --> 1571.84
it's my humble opinion

1586.72 --> 1590.799
all right yes tesla rats i know it's

1589.919 --> 1594.48
it's

1590.799 --> 1596.559
yeah who knows my issue is

1594.48 --> 1598.0
if it would just be industrialized and

1596.559 --> 1601.039
perfected and all that that's

1598.0 --> 1603.919
just a technology

1601.039 --> 1605.679
that's just gonna mess up everything

1603.919 --> 1612.3200000000002
everything

1605.679 --> 1615.279
it's crazy

1612.32 --> 1616.24
oh it's super convenient if space were

1615.279 --> 1618.799
real

1616.24 --> 1620.4
and yeah you constantly have to bridge

1618.799 --> 1623.52
the vacuum

1620.4 --> 1624.96
from ship to living planet with the

1623.52 --> 1626.0
breathable atmosphere that can

1624.96 --> 1629.2
supposedly stick to

1626.0 --> 1631.039
it right yeah then teleportation is

1629.2 --> 1633.2
extremely convenient why

1631.039 --> 1634.32
you know that the teleportation was

1633.2 --> 1637.919
basically

1634.32 --> 1640.96
introduced as a as a stage

1637.919 --> 1644.64
device just as a

1640.96 --> 1647.2
a macguffin to make transitions easier

1644.64 --> 1649.3600000000001
do you realize that that that is how it

1647.2 --> 1649.919
was really invented it was just a stage

1649.36 --> 1652.8799999999999
trick

1649.919 --> 1654.72
it's a sci-fi stage trick that's what it

1652.88 --> 1657.7600000000002
was the teleportation

1654.72 --> 1660.64
and then fantasy sci-fi fantasy

1657.76 --> 1669.84
latched onto it and yeah now we got

1660.64 --> 1669.8400000000001
everything we got now

1694.72 --> 1698.48
for inanimate objects it would be quite

1696.88 --> 1703.6000000000001
handy

1698.48 --> 1706.72
no look the thing about it is

1703.6 --> 1708.1589999999999
if you would teleport things that

1706.72 --> 1710.559
literally means you can just

1708.159 --> 1714.0
fabricate everything from scratch why

1710.559 --> 1714.0
would you teleport anything

1716.0 --> 1719.6
you could just make it on the spot why

1719.12 --> 1721.9189999999999
do i

1719.6 --> 1724.08
try what transportation you just make

1721.919 --> 1726.3200000000002
everything on the spot

1724.08 --> 1727.36
you know kind of like the replicators do

1726.32 --> 1729.36
in

1727.36 --> 1731.36
star trek in yeah and the more advanced

1729.36 --> 1739.12
star treks

1731.36 --> 1742.9599999999998
the laters they basically say yeah we

1739.12 --> 1742.9599999999998
just transform energy into matter

1743.84 --> 1753.84
but yeah teleportation also just means

1746.559 --> 1753.84
disintegration and

1765.52 --> 1772.96
anyway yeah teleportation it's

1769.76 --> 1773.52
it's science fiction it's a science

1772.96 --> 1775.44
fiction

1773.52 --> 1781.84
chew toy and it's probably gonna hang

1775.44 --> 1781.8400000000001
around for a while

1784.799 --> 1789.76
uh yesterday yeah that's been claimed

1787.84 --> 1791.4399999999998
yeah sure it has

1789.76 --> 1795.84
sure it's been claimed that they

1791.44 --> 1795.8400000000001
teleported that

1816.0 --> 1823.84
exactly stash more heads you get it

1830.88 --> 1835.1200000000001
yeah things could get very nutty that

1832.799 --> 1837.76
way you know because

1835.12 --> 1838.799
who needs a crew when you can just yeah

1837.76 --> 1842.1589999999999
clone yourself

1838.799 --> 1842.1589999999999
like 20 times

1845.039 --> 1851.36
and yeah it might be a problem

1848.24 --> 1855.679
if they've served their function but

1851.36 --> 1855.6789999999999
yeah it's it wouldn't get crazy that way

1861.76 --> 1865.44
i don't know you'd get situations as i

1864.08 --> 1868.08
don't know but this is all kind of

1865.44 --> 1870.559
creepy anyway but

1868.08 --> 1872.6399999999999
you would have like yeah the original

1870.559 --> 1875.279
officer

1872.64 --> 1876.24
was that has to be like very functional

1875.279 --> 1879.6
and he would just

1876.24 --> 1882.799
create teleport versions

1879.6 --> 1886.6399999999999
of himself to a ship

1882.799 --> 1889.679
and yeah they're all expandable

1886.64 --> 1890.48
like that and i don't know maybe some

1889.679 --> 1892.3990000000001
kind of control

1890.48 --> 1894.48
mind control yeah i think that if

1892.399 --> 1896.1589999999999
literally the same version of you

1894.48 --> 1898.0
exists you're probably going to be

1896.159 --> 1902.88
telepathically linked

1898.0 --> 1902.88
seems very likely to me so yeah

1903.039 --> 1906.399
but yet you know the funny thing is is

1904.799 --> 1908.799
that dungeons and dragons

1906.399 --> 1910.2399999999998
actually has dabbled with this sort of

1908.799 --> 1914.399
things like

1910.24 --> 1918.24
creating duplicates of yourself as a

1914.399 --> 1918.2399999999998
as an archmage and yeah

1918.48 --> 1921.519
so they already kind of fooled around

1920.24 --> 1923.44
with that

1921.519 --> 1925.039
but yeah that's what we that's what you

1923.44 --> 1926.799
get you know

1925.039 --> 1928.399
you want the technology you want the

1926.799 --> 1930.399
perfection well

1928.399 --> 1932.32
good luck with that because this is what

1930.399 --> 1935.6
you get

1932.32 --> 1936.6499999999999
think that's going to be doable this is

1935.6 --> 1940.24
uh

1936.65 --> 1942.96
[Music]

1940.24 --> 1943.36
i've not seen the show altered carbon

1942.96 --> 1946.64
like

1943.36 --> 1946.6399999999999
that word alone just

1946.88 --> 1949.8400000000001
i don't want to know

1954.159 --> 1959.3600000000001
oh god okay well maybe it is cool you

1957.039 --> 1961.919
know i make up these things but it's

1959.36 --> 1963.36
this is not like oh i just figured out

1961.919 --> 1967.519
something so cool

1963.36 --> 1970.9599999999998
no this is actually a warning

1967.519 --> 1977.84
you don't want that it's a fantasy

1970.96 --> 1977.8400000000001
keep it there

1987.679 --> 1991.1200000000001
oh yeah i got some fresh honey by the

1989.679 --> 1993.76
way

1991.12 --> 1994.32
i'm gonna try uh getting a big scoop of

1993.76 --> 1996.72
honey

1994.32 --> 2005.84
before i go to sleep again let's see if

1996.72 --> 2005.84
it does something

2007.6 --> 2015.76
but it helps keep the dreams at bay

2011.919 --> 2020.0
i don't know maybe it

2015.76 --> 2020.32
helps take the grip of the dreams over

2020.0 --> 2024.64
you

2020.32 --> 2028.96
away but i still kind of dream

2024.64 --> 2028.96
even when i have cannabis it's just that

2029.36 --> 2035.84
it's a little bit more distant it

2032.48 --> 2039.1200000000001
yeah but i have a lot of like

2035.84 --> 2041.9189999999999
where i realize i'm dreaming and i'm

2039.12 --> 2044.1589999999999
like almost opening my eyes inside of

2041.919 --> 2046.72
the dream and i know that

2044.159 --> 2047.2
but i can't really get a full grip on it

2046.72 --> 2049.839
now

2047.2 --> 2050.639
even in my youth i had a lot of these

2049.839 --> 2052.96
dreams

2050.639 --> 2055.04
where i would be like oh yeah i want to

2052.96 --> 2055.76
do [ __ ] but i can't open my eyes or

2055.04 --> 2061.119
something you know

2055.76 --> 2063.76
very weird how that worked and

2061.119 --> 2067.28
yeah now i'm just even if i smell

2063.76 --> 2067.28
cannabis i still dream it's

2068.24 --> 2073.4399999999996
but maybe that's also because i've been

2070.079 --> 2076.3990000000003
smoking for a long time and i just

2073.44 --> 2078.48
i don't smoke that much at each go and

2076.399 --> 2079.679
it doesn't make such a long-term impact

2078.48 --> 2082.879
anymore

2079.679 --> 2087.919
so i usually don't really smoke right

2082.879 --> 2091.2799999999997
before going to sleep i don't like that

2087.919 --> 2091.2799999999997
tends to actually keep me up

2098.32 --> 2101.6800000000003
but yeah it said that especially in the

2100.24 --> 2103.2799999999997
beginning

2101.68 --> 2105.44
when you've never smoked and you start

2103.28 --> 2108.96
smoking cannabis it makes a really big

2105.44 --> 2109.44
impact and you do basically go through

2108.96 --> 2112.7200000000003
very

2109.44 --> 2116.32
intense body sleep and

2112.72 --> 2120.0789999999997
eating to your metabolism others a lot

2116.32 --> 2120.6400000000003
get really hungry often but you dream

2120.079 --> 2122.96
less

2120.64 --> 2125.1189999999997
so you just like wake up like whoa i

2122.96 --> 2128.0
just had a really deep sleep

2125.119 --> 2130.079
but yeah in that period you don't

2128.0 --> 2133.44
remember any of your dreams

2130.079 --> 2135.119
if you even have any so

2133.44 --> 2144.96
you must technically have some but your

2135.119 --> 2147.119
conscience is not latching onto it

2144.96 --> 2149.68
but yeah that that doesn't really happen

2147.119 --> 2152.6400000000003
to me anymore

2149.68 --> 2155.52
maybe if i i quit again and then restart

2152.64 --> 2158.48
smoking because when i i had a five p

2155.52 --> 2161.68
five year period where no eight years i

2158.48 --> 2165.119
literally didn't smoke any cannabis

2161.68 --> 2167.52
and when i started up again yeah

2165.119 --> 2168.4
made a huge freaking impact again it was

2167.52 --> 2173.119
like whoa

2168.4 --> 2177.119
this is exactly as if i were 15 again

2173.119 --> 2181.04
so it actually did a lot

2177.119 --> 2183.599
like re like my body had been i guess

2181.04 --> 2186.32
gradually running out of cannabinoids

2183.599 --> 2189.3590000000004
over the years and

2186.32 --> 2189.3590000000004
yeah it was like

2189.68 --> 2196.3199999999997
it used it it used it a lot

2193.599 --> 2197.119
and it didn't smoke it with like tobacco

2196.32 --> 2200.32
back then

2197.119 --> 2204.079
either uh

2200.32 --> 2208.079
i i you yeah i literally use it as uh

2204.079 --> 2208.079
it was like breathing in incense

2208.64 --> 2212.3199999999997
when i started it up again but when i

2211.04 --> 2215.7599999999998
did that it like

2212.32 --> 2219.28
my body like responded really well to it

2215.76 --> 2222.7200000000003
it was almost like i started to look

2219.28 --> 2226.8
younger like i looked five years younger

2222.72 --> 2226.7999999999997
like wrinkles went away

2226.96 --> 2231.119
and the weird thing is yeah that kind of

2229.52 --> 2234.32
stayed

2231.119 --> 2234.32
it stayed like that

2239.44 --> 2245.76
so yeah but yeah i

2243.04 --> 2247.04
i smoke cannabis regularly you know

2245.76 --> 2249.8390000000004
daily

2247.04 --> 2253.2799999999997
so it's not really getting in the way of

2249.839 --> 2253.2799999999997
my dreaming i still have plenty of

2254.839 --> 2257.839
dreams

2269.44 --> 2272.8
all right more color well same goes for

2272.079 --> 2275.04
me you know

2272.8 --> 2277.76
i'm very glad of it especially since i'm

2275.04 --> 2281.119
still kind of like

2277.76 --> 2281.119
wanting to start a family

2283.119 --> 2287.28
because i i still do you know

2287.839 --> 2291.04
and it helps that i look like this and i

2289.839 --> 2294.16
catch a lot of eyes

2291.04 --> 2294.16
you know with this

2294.24 --> 2297.5989999999997
if i walk outside yeah ladies do turn

2296.64 --> 2301.5989999999997
their head

2297.599 --> 2304.48
relation to yeah now i'm just bragging

2301.599 --> 2313.839
i'm just stupid bragging i don't even

2304.48 --> 2313.839
properly work out

2315.68 --> 2319.52
but i try to compensate that with being

2317.92 --> 2321.599
really nice

2319.52 --> 2323.2
and respectful and gallant and all that

2321.599 --> 2325.6800000000003
and

2323.2 --> 2327.839
that's yeah that's just what i like to

2325.68 --> 2327.839
do

2343.04 --> 2347.2
never been aged a year over 30 okay

2352.32 --> 2359.52
all right

2355.359 --> 2359.52
i'll take that uh

2360.88 --> 2369.839
all right

2392.72 --> 2396.72
yeah you know what with the cannabis

2394.32 --> 2397.04
thing and everything it is it is kind of

2396.72 --> 2400.48
like

2397.04 --> 2404.0
difficult you know in this world

2400.48 --> 2407.76
because technically

2404.0 --> 2409.68
if you can use cannabis in some way

2407.76 --> 2411.2000000000003
without getting addicted to it and then

2409.68 --> 2414.24
like using it as fair

2411.2 --> 2418.56
sparse medicine like that it actually

2414.24 --> 2421.5989999999997
does a lot of good but if you start

2418.56 --> 2424.0789999999997
using it as a comfort drug kind of

2421.599 --> 2427.52
situation or anything other than just

2424.079 --> 2430.88
a sparse medicine then

2427.52 --> 2434.64
yeah the detriments also come

2430.88 --> 2437.119
so that's why i generally

2434.64 --> 2438.4
would not encourage youth like people

2437.119 --> 2441.599
under 20

2438.4 --> 2443.92
to smoke but yeah

2441.599 --> 2446.079
unless they were very aware of this and

2443.92 --> 2446.56
they would not be peer pressured into

2446.079 --> 2449.3590000000004
like

2446.56 --> 2450.0
go go go more more more anything like

2449.359 --> 2453.5989999999997
that

2450.0 --> 2455.76
you know

2453.599 --> 2458.56
because if you really smoke a lot it

2455.76 --> 2462.079
will also disrupt your concentration

2458.56 --> 2462.64
[ __ ] if you're if you have a very busy

2462.079 --> 2465.2000000000003
life

2462.64 --> 2467.1189999999997
and you're still young it it disrupted a

2465.2 --> 2470.24
lot of my concentration

2467.119 --> 2473.119
now despite all that disruption

2470.24 --> 2475.5989999999997
i still had some periods in between

2473.119 --> 2478.56
where i didn't continually smoke

2475.599 --> 2480.4
when i almost felt like oh [ __ ] i i'm

2478.56 --> 2482.16
going to screw up everything if i don't

2480.4 --> 2483.6800000000003
do something right now and then i did

2482.16 --> 2485.839
something right now and then

2483.68 --> 2488.0
i was really good at it anyway and

2485.839 --> 2491.52
that's like almost the

2488.0 --> 2495.68
weird situation is that if you quit

2491.52 --> 2497.119
smoking like at first it might be very

2495.68 --> 2498.8799999999997
uncomfortable but if you got really

2497.119 --> 2501.28
something to do then it's almost like

2498.88 --> 2506.0
you get this unique

2501.28 --> 2509.2000000000003
energy unleash that is really remarkable

2506.0 --> 2511.839
but it it happens in the quitting of it

2509.2 --> 2513.9199999999996
this short period where you it's almost

2511.839 --> 2517.92
like the angels are on your shoulder

2513.92 --> 2523.839
continually it's funny how it works out

2517.92 --> 2523.839
like that

2523.92 --> 2531.599
like micro dosing with shoes ah

2527.92 --> 2535.04
now now look shrooms is

2531.599 --> 2536.0
very different you don't have shroom

2535.04 --> 2539.359
receptors in your

2536.0 --> 2542.16
cells you do have cannabinoid receptors

2539.359 --> 2542.16
in your cells though

2542.8 --> 2550.1600000000003
shrooms is different you know there but

2546.0 --> 2554.4
yeah the the whole psychotropics

2550.16 --> 2555.92
what is the psychonutrients

2554.4 --> 2557.52
yeah there's all kinds of things with

2555.92 --> 2564.0
that we

2557.52 --> 2568.56
are shrooms okay getting sick

2564.0 --> 2571.04
what i think if you say that

2568.56 --> 2572.7999999999997
we are shrooms you probably had too many

2571.04 --> 2579.839
shrooms

2572.8 --> 2579.8390000000004
you become what you eat

2598.72 --> 2607.839
all right

2628.319 --> 2635.839
yeah mushrooms are flowers technically

2643.599 --> 2646.319
oh god

2646.72 --> 2654.48
well look mushrooms the regular kind

2651.2 --> 2656.96
you know they can be

2654.48 --> 2658.16
extremely nutritious if you know which

2656.96 --> 2661.28
ones to

2658.16 --> 2661.5989999999997
to take and what to do with it i admit

2661.28 --> 2663.52
that

2661.599 --> 2665.52
i am not a big fan of mushrooms in

2663.52 --> 2667.68
general

2665.52 --> 2670.48
but i am aware that's there's some

2667.68 --> 2674.96
really good nutrients in some of them

2670.48 --> 2678.16
like for example the shiitake mushroom

2674.96 --> 2680.2400000000002
i in certain like if i make soup

2678.16 --> 2682.0789999999997
vegetable soup i put some of that in

2680.24 --> 2685.52
there or quite a lot

2682.079 --> 2686.2400000000002
which is kind of like a mushroom yuck i

2685.52 --> 2688.48
don't like that

2686.24 --> 2690.24
really but i know it it's really good

2688.48 --> 2693.68
for me

2690.24 --> 2696.8799999999997
and the same goes for what is it a

2693.68 --> 2696.8799999999997
typical mushroom soup

2697.04 --> 2701.44
how do you call them champions

2702.8 --> 2707.119
yeah this the typical standard mushrooms

2705.2 --> 2709.5989999999997
and then have it all grinded up and you

2707.119 --> 2713.52
can have a pretty nice soup with that

2709.599 --> 2715.52
now if it's completely unrecognizable

2713.52 --> 2718.72
it's just pulp then i actually kind of

2715.52 --> 2719.3
like soup like that i just don't like

2718.72 --> 2723.5989999999997
mushrooms

2719.3 --> 2727.3590000000004
[Laughter]

2723.599 --> 2728.1600000000003
all right psychotropics no any drugs

2727.359 --> 2731.5989999999997
really

2728.16 --> 2735.1189999999997
i'm very careful with drinking drugs i

2731.599 --> 2735.839
like even just cannabis and alcohol is

2735.119 --> 2740.8
already

2735.839 --> 2746.72
back full more than anyone

2740.8 --> 2749.6800000000003
for me that is you know it's enough

2746.72 --> 2751.2
i'm not really eager to just stretch my

2749.68 --> 2761.839
mind up into

2751.2 --> 2761.839
weird ways and all that

2764.96 --> 2768.96
although yeah if the effects are really

2767.2 --> 2771.4399999999996
subtle then i

2768.96 --> 2772.7200000000003
yeah then i wouldn't mind too much so

2771.44 --> 2776.56
for example things like

2772.72 --> 2780.56
brain force psychotropic from the uh

2776.56 --> 2782.24
or psychonutrient from the infowar story

2780.56 --> 2783.92
yeah i bought that a long time i have

2782.24 --> 2788.3999999999996
tried that

2783.92 --> 2790.7200000000003
and yeah it does something but did he do

2788.4 --> 2790.7200000000003
a lot

2791.04 --> 2794.96
i don't know i think it probably for

2793.599 --> 2798.1600000000003
somebody that's not

2794.96 --> 2799.76
used to that the higher state of mind

2798.16 --> 2803.2799999999997
yeah it would probably be pretty

2799.76 --> 2807.28
effective or radical for me

2803.28 --> 2810.2400000000002
it's okay i get a lot out of just

2807.28 --> 2810.2400000000002
regular foods

2812.319 --> 2819.2799999999997
and even the supplements that i take

2815.68 --> 2821.52
no a regular type of supplements

2819.28 --> 2824.3190000000004
i get a lot out of what i eat and i

2821.52 --> 2828.64
really always

2824.319 --> 2830.72
am pulled

2828.64 --> 2832.16
like my instinct literally pulls me to

2830.72 --> 2835.52
like you need this

2832.16 --> 2837.2
you need that and then i take it

2835.52 --> 2838.64
even though it might be something that i

2837.2 --> 2841.04
normally don't

2838.64 --> 2842.0
don't typically take my intuition just

2841.04 --> 2845.52
says you got

2842.0 --> 2848.319
you need that right now

2845.52 --> 2848.319
then i do that

2850.079 --> 2859.8390000000004
so you can get high on soup no

2853.92 --> 2859.839
talking about regular mushroom soup

2860.319 --> 2864.48
but yeah you can get pretty high on word

2862.96 --> 2868.8
soup though

2864.48 --> 2869.52
you know especially if you like to reify

2868.8 --> 2873.599
those

2869.52 --> 2874.64
words you can get pretty damn high on

2873.599 --> 2876.8
that

2874.64 --> 2887.839
all you need is imagination and the

2876.8 --> 2887.8390000000004
unwillingness to step away from it

2888.079 --> 2892.1600000000003
oh yeah talking about home cooking i got

2890.64 --> 2895.2
spaghetti

2892.16 --> 2897.1189999999997
ah i'm really looking forward to it

2895.2 --> 2900.0789999999997
especially because i don't have to make

2897.119 --> 2903.359
it anymore to eat it now

2900.079 --> 2903.3590000000004
because it is really good

2906.559 --> 2914.6400000000003
some great spaghetti sauce the bottom of

2909.92 --> 2917.28
uh virgin olive oil everything organic

2914.64 --> 2920.0789999999997
with some chipped onions everything hand

2917.28 --> 2920.079
chipped everything

2920.24 --> 2927.359
garlic a whole loaf of it some

2923.52 --> 2930.079
fresh fresh laurel leaves from a little

2927.359 --> 2931.5989999999997
laurel plant that i had among my herbs

2930.079 --> 2935.28
it's the first time i tried it

2931.599 --> 2938.48
like there was literally this resin

2935.28 --> 2943.28
this laurel smelling resin on the leaves

2938.48 --> 2946.96
freshly i put it in there oh so good uh

2943.28 --> 2947.28
and some organic uh dried herbs a lot of

2946.96 --> 2950.7200000000003
it

2947.28 --> 2954.6400000000003
uh oregano like yeah a whole bunch

2950.72 --> 2957.68
big big pile of it uh

2954.64 --> 2958.5589999999997
also a bottom of carrots i use that

2957.68 --> 2961.6
instead of meat

2958.559 --> 2964.2400000000002
i don't it's all vegan this one

2961.6 --> 2968.5589999999997
[Music]

2964.24 --> 2971.839
added some zucchini to it

2968.559 --> 2971.8390000000004
what is it called again

2972.16 --> 2975.839
eggplant

2972.97 --> 2979.359
[Music]

2975.839 --> 2983.44
and yeah of course a huge pile of

2979.359 --> 2986.4
hand squeezed tomatoes like hand peeled

2986.4 --> 2989.6800000000003
skin off

2987.76 --> 2991.92
and then cold water to scare it off as

2989.68 --> 2993.04

2991.92 --> 2996.079
there

2993.04 --> 2998.319
everything by hand because i don't know

2996.079 --> 3000.319

arwenian magic hand treatment and it

3002.24 --> 3006.4799999999996

3053.92 --> 3057.44
getting some dead leaves

3055.44 --> 3058.7200000000003
on them and everything but it was still

3057.44 --> 3061.76
really good and i yeah

3058.72 --> 3061.7599999999998
meshed it all in there

use spelt spaghetti by the way

3128.48 --> 3139.839
yeah but stasmaretz if we do that then

3130.559 --> 3139.8390000000004
we both have spaghetti it seems a bit

3139.92 --> 3143.119
um yeah maybe

3150.4 --> 3154.4
although my kitchen is not very big

3156.16 --> 3159.68
okay this doesn't rat's fine

3160.48 --> 3169.359
i do really pride my cooking so

3165.52 --> 3172.16
you know with my ex i really was like i

3169.359 --> 3174.16
kind of decided to be like the man of

3172.16 --> 3176.7999999999997
like the

3174.16 --> 3176.7999999999997
house man

3177.92 --> 3184.96
i keep like i secure it

3180.96 --> 3186.96
i do the cooking and yeah

3184.96 --> 3189.359
the cleaning although i tend to be a

3186.96 --> 3191.76
little bit manly and lazy with that so

3189.359 --> 3194.7999999999997
it might help sometimes if the lady just

3191.76 --> 3198.6400000000003
looks at me like it's not clean and then

3194.8 --> 3198.6400000000003
i will get to cleaning right away

3198.96 --> 3209.839
like yeah ah damn i miss living together

3217.28 --> 3223.8390000000004
oh dear

3224.0 --> 3227.2
it sounds interesting

3231.76 --> 3235.5200000000004
hi amanda young thank you for the five

3233.359 --> 3237.2
dollars super chat donation

3235.52 --> 3239.92
or when this feels like a weekend i'm

3237.2 --> 3242.0
loving this two days in a row

3239.92 --> 3244.48
your ace thank you thank you very much

3242.0 --> 3247.359
for your support

3244.48 --> 3248.88
yeah i'm having fun too you know it's

3247.359 --> 3253.68
okay

3248.88 --> 3253.6800000000003
although yeah i do miss uh nathan's

3254.72 --> 3258.9599999999996
nathan and the other guys you know they

3256.559 --> 3261.6800000000003
are very much more technically focused

3258.96 --> 3265.119
than i am i'm just so

3261.68 --> 3266.8799999999997
doing everything that it's really

3265.119 --> 3269.839
because of the flat earth debates that

3266.88 --> 3271.2000000000003
it it does keep my head more technical

3269.839 --> 3274.72
because otherwise i'm just going to talk

3271.2 --> 3274.72
about everything about food and

3275.76 --> 3279.599
conceptual ideas and science fiction and

3278.64 --> 3283.04
movies and

3279.599 --> 3286.2400000000002
you know how that goes oh

3283.04 --> 3286.96
pizza oh i missed that i haven't had a

3286.24 --> 3289.7599999999998
pizza in

3286.96 --> 3290.559
over half a year because yeah i don't

3289.76 --> 3293.8390000000004
have a

3290.559 --> 3293.8390000000004
a working oven

3294.72 --> 3301.68
the oven part of the microwave broke boo

3298.64 --> 3303.359
i really miss pizza i can make some good

3301.68 --> 3305.68
pizza too

3303.359 --> 3307.839
although i think it's good it's

3305.68 --> 3307.839
different

3310.72 --> 3316.0
also since i don't really eat cheese and

3314.0 --> 3321.839
meat together anymore it's also been

3316.0 --> 3321.839
kind of different

3325.2 --> 3331.04
that was weird how that worked i was

3328.16 --> 3334.0789999999997
vegetarian for over a year

3331.04 --> 3336.24
remember that some of you might

3334.079 --> 3338.6400000000003
a full vegetarian like i really didn't

3336.24 --> 3341.2
do anything meat

3338.64 --> 3342.64
and then after well that period i just

3341.2 --> 3344.48
got

3342.64 --> 3346.5589999999997
like yeah because in that entire period

3344.48 --> 3348.88
i didn't even hunger for me i just

3346.559 --> 3351.8390000000004
didn't want it

3348.88 --> 3352.48
it didn't like the smell of it and then

3351.839 --> 3354.5589999999997
after

3352.48 --> 3356.4
the whole period yeah it started to come

3354.559 --> 3360.3190000000004
back i tried again

3356.4 --> 3361.119
and then i started eating sporadically i

3360.319 --> 3363.119
don't

3361.119 --> 3365.52
because still now you know i still do

3363.119 --> 3367.52
eat meat but i don't eat it every day

3365.52 --> 3370.96
and i notice that when i do it

3367.52 --> 3372.559
like it's like a burden on my shoulder

3370.96 --> 3375.68
it's like not too great

3372.559 --> 3378.3190000000004
for me to eat it constantly eat it

3375.68 --> 3378.319
sparingly

3378.48 --> 3384.2400000000002
but it's still nice but instead i've

3382.24 --> 3388.0
completely quit on milk and cheese

3384.24 --> 3389.04
like yeah i got that out of my diet

3388.0 --> 3392.0
although i

3389.04 --> 3393.599
did kind of get the pecorino cheese on

3392.0 --> 3396.24
my spaghetti

3393.599 --> 3398.0
i i could not leave it and i yeah i

3396.24 --> 3399.4399999999996
haven't blown up like a balloon or

3398.0 --> 3401.92
anything so

3399.44 --> 3403.44
whatever that weird reaction was that i

3401.92 --> 3404.0
had at the time i thought that i had

3403.44 --> 3407.119
lactose

3404.0 --> 3409.44
intolerance or something

3407.119 --> 3411.119
well it's not really there anymore it

3409.44 --> 3414.319
seems

3411.119 --> 3416.48
yeah very nice

3414.319 --> 3419.119
but i'm still not just gonna make a food

3416.48 --> 3422.16
habit of eating cheese again

3419.119 --> 3424.319
it's not that great anyway

3422.16 --> 3426.0
what am i saying it is really great but

3424.319 --> 3427.839
it's just i'm

3426.0 --> 3429.92
i'm eating meat so i'm just leaving the

3427.839 --> 3431.52
cheese out and then maybe at some point

3429.92 --> 3432.0
i'll be sick of meat again and then i'll

3431.52 --> 3435.92
get back

3432.0 --> 3439.599
on the cheese that's

3435.92 --> 3439.599
i think how i'm doing it

3444.559 --> 3448.4
do you know if nathan has managed to

3446.4 --> 3461.839
raise enough to get his computer fixed

3448.4 --> 3461.839
yes i think it's already being fixed

3470.48 --> 3474.2400000000002
get tired fast when you eat too much

3472.319 --> 3476.5589999999997
yeah i have that too

3474.24 --> 3476.5589999999997
yes

3480.559 --> 3484.3190000000004
this is just like i'm yeah i'm not a

3483.359 --> 3487.68
really big

3484.319 --> 3491.52
guy i don't have that much room in there

3487.68 --> 3493.5989999999997
so yeah if i just stuff it too much i'm

3491.52 --> 3495.92
just gonna eventually just like oh

3493.599 --> 3495.92
[ __ ]

3496.64 --> 3503.839
get really knackered

3504.799 --> 3512.48
stopped cow's milk no issues since okay

3508.64 --> 3515.1189999999997
well my cheese is still cow based

3512.48 --> 3519.04
but yeah i did just a bit of sprinkles

3515.119 --> 3519.04
very old cheese that's not as bad

3519.28 --> 3524.4
but yeah no more milk you know i that's

3522.48 --> 3526.319
also funny how that worked because

3524.4 --> 3527.6800000000003
i've been drinking coffee for quite some

3526.319 --> 3529.7599999999998
time and i've always used

3527.68 --> 3532.48
milk in my coffee but i basically since

3529.76 --> 3535.6800000000003
i discovered the tumeric

3532.48 --> 3540.559
component to coffee

3535.68 --> 3540.5589999999997
like yeah that milk just went away

3541.2 --> 3547.1189999999997
it's gone and to be fair

3544.4 --> 3547.599
i think it's a lot better for me that i

3547.119 --> 3549.599
don't

3547.599 --> 3550.88
put coffee in my milk anymore in the

3549.599 --> 3554.079
morning overall

3550.88 --> 3554.079
i think that's helped a lot

3557.68 --> 3562.5589999999997
and yeah i don't even miss it that much

3560.319 --> 3562.5589999999997
you know

3564.96 --> 3568.0
although yeah you know if it's like

3566.96 --> 3571.119
winter time i

3568.0 --> 3572.24
will probably at some point at least a

3571.119 --> 3576.079
couple of times

3572.24 --> 3579.7599999999998
drink chocolate milk self-made

3576.079 --> 3583.52
hot chocolate with some like full

3579.76 --> 3583.5200000000004
full fatty organic milk

3583.599 --> 3587.92
and that's gonna be cow's milk because

3586.16 --> 3591.52
yeah goat milk just

3587.92 --> 3591.52
the taste is yeah

3591.599 --> 3594.319
i don't like it

3595.44 --> 3599.2000000000003
but by the way they don't have goat's

3596.96 --> 3601.52
milk even i think

3599.2 --> 3602.64
i think if it was like super fresh from

3601.52 --> 3606.4
really good organic

3602.64 --> 3607.2
variety like it was a big bear goat milk

3606.4 --> 3609.76
or something yeah

3607.2 --> 3610.8799999999997
that would probably be awesome to have

3609.76 --> 3615.44
chocolate milk with

3610.88 --> 3615.44
that would be amazing or back

3621.119 --> 3625.6800000000003
but yeah overall a lot of the goat

3623.52 --> 3628.079
products

3625.68 --> 3629.9199999999996
they just have this oilishness to it

3628.079 --> 3630.7200000000003
that i don't really i never really like

3629.92 --> 3634.559
that

3630.72 --> 3634.5589999999997
and i have trouble getting used to it

3640.839 --> 3643.839
too

3645.28 --> 3654.079
oh that's on can have cheese and cream

3649.92 --> 3654.079
but not milk hmm

3655.76 --> 3661.2000000000003
all right okay good glad that works out

3658.079 --> 3661.2000000000003
for you eyes wide shot

3666.4 --> 3671.839
but where do you get it

3675.92 --> 3680.319
yeah anyway i'll try to remember that

3678.24 --> 3681.04
you know when it's gonna be colder again

3680.319 --> 3683.44
oh

3681.04 --> 3686.319
because it will it's not going to be

3683.44 --> 3686.319
this hot forever

3689.04 --> 3696.24
yeah i will probably try to make so

3692.88 --> 3698.88
see if they have some organic goat milk

3696.24 --> 3700.319
at the supermarket and then try to make

3698.88 --> 3703.119
some chocolate milk with that

3700.319 --> 3703.119
see how that is

3706.559 --> 3713.52
it could be i sweatshot

3710.0 --> 3716.799
but you know i prefer to

3713.52 --> 3720.48
kind of stay away from yes

3716.799 --> 3723.2
like supermarket milk in general

3720.48 --> 3726.079
i would really prefer to just like

3723.2 --> 3729.2
literally see the goat squeezing it out

3726.079 --> 3729.2000000000003
and then using that

3731.44 --> 3741.839
but yeah i don't know anybody with a

3734.079 --> 3743.92
organically fed goat in my neighborhood

3741.839 --> 3746.5589999999997
oh there there are plenty of chickens

3743.92 --> 3746.559
around though

3748.0 --> 3751.839
which i love you know that's that's the

3749.92 --> 3753.92
funny thing even

3751.839 --> 3755.2799999999997
there's like these these roosters among

3753.92 --> 3757.039
the chicken

3755.28 --> 3759.039
the chicken groups and they're like two

3757.039 --> 3760.6400000000003
there's one over there

3759.039 --> 3763.44
behind the roof and there's one here

3760.64 --> 3766.0789999999997
within basically within the flat

3763.44 --> 3766.88
and i always hear that one i used to

3766.079 --> 3769.52
hate that

3766.88 --> 3771.2000000000003
i used to hate the sound of it now i

3769.52 --> 3775.28
freaking love it

3771.2 --> 3775.2799999999997
it brings me joy every time i hear that

3775.68 --> 3778.799
it's so funny how that changed during my

3778.319 --> 3783.7599999999998
life

3778.799 --> 3787.0389999999998
like 30 years ago i hated the sound of

3783.76 --> 3791.119
of a uh of a

3787.039 --> 3795.039
a hen a rooster crowing

3791.119 --> 3795.039
i hated the sound of it now i love it

3795.68 --> 3799.359
and like even when i'm for example

3798.64 --> 3804.8799999999997
sleeping

3799.359 --> 3808.5589999999997
or something it doesn't disrupt me

3804.88 --> 3810.0
it's almost like a part of me wakes up

3808.559 --> 3812.799
to establish yeah it's

3810.0 --> 3815.039
the cr it's the the rooster and he's

3812.799 --> 3817.2
being very enthusiastic

3815.039 --> 3819.6800000000003
and it's not right next to me in my ear

3817.2 --> 3822.3999999999996
you know but it's still audible enough

3819.68 --> 3823.44
that it just yeah it doesn't really wake

3822.4 --> 3826.64
me up

3823.44 --> 3828.16
in shock but then again i don't live a

3826.64 --> 3839.839
farmer's life either

3828.16 --> 3839.839
and probably gonna use it as that

3841.68 --> 3848.72
hmm interesting eyes wide shut

3845.839 --> 3848.72
never thought of that

3850.079 --> 3856.88
you think i think there would be

3853.839 --> 3860.88
like online

3856.88 --> 3863.44
organic farms that literally sell their

3860.88 --> 3867.839
products over the internet

3863.44 --> 3867.839
like that

3873.76 --> 3881.8390000000004
that sounds fascinating anyway hey a

3876.64 --> 3881.839
little rest ahead

3899.359 --> 3906.0789999999997
late show no no i i look there's no

3903.039 --> 3906.88
live ladder debates so i did it

3906.079 --> 3910.319
yesterday too

3906.88 --> 3910.319
so i'm just continuing

3910.72 --> 3917.1189999999997
for yeah at least an hour so i'm gonna

3914.799 --> 3918.88
play for at least 15 more minutes and

3917.119 --> 3921.119
then we'll see if i ran out the show or

3918.88 --> 3923.119
not

3921.119 --> 3924.88
but yeah it's been great so far i have

3923.119 --> 3928.6400000000003
no objection you know otherwise

3924.88 --> 3928.6400000000003
i just be sitting in chat

3931.359 --> 3937.839
it is very hot though

3940.64 --> 3942.96
all right

3949.52 --> 3954.72
so you up early or are you up late

3952.64 --> 3965.839
rasta i think you're probably upper

3954.72 --> 3965.839
really early

3976.839 --> 3979.839
hmm

3999.76 --> 4007.8390000000004
hmm having trouble sleeping rasta

4004.4 --> 4009.28
that sucks is it

4007.839 --> 4013.7599999999998
it's not because it's too hot or

4009.28 --> 4013.76
anything right do you have an air co

4019.119 --> 4021.839
hmm

4031.2 --> 4037.1189999999997
yeah well anyway with this weather

4034.4 --> 4038.799
it's kind of tough you know because i

4037.119 --> 4039.599
don't know how hot it is over there but

4038.799 --> 4044.0
over here

4039.599 --> 4044.0
it's like really warm until pretty late

4044.079 --> 4048.559
and then like after 12 it really starts

4047.039 --> 4050.6400000000003
to become a kind of

4048.559 --> 4052.3190000000004
a temperature when it finally becomes

4050.64 --> 4055.2
cool enough to properly do

4052.319 --> 4056.5589999999997
something physical but that's really

4055.2 --> 4060.319
deceptive because

4056.559 --> 4061.76
if you then stay up for very long

4060.319 --> 4065.7599999999998
yeah you're gonna have to go to sleep

4061.76 --> 4065.76
and then sleep through the freaking heat

4070.72 --> 4074.319
unless you of course have just the house

4072.559 --> 4077.8390000000004
with an air conditioning system so you

4074.319 --> 4077.839
don't have that problem

4084.559 --> 4091.8390000000004
all right anyway thanks for popping by

4114.719 --> 4119.839
hmm hold on what's this

4134.88 --> 4147.839
all right

4171.839 --> 4176.48
ah welcome back mark yeah i'm going for

4174.719 --> 4179.279
like 12 more minutes or so and then i'm

4176.48 --> 4179.2789999999995
gonna round it up

4184.08 --> 4189.839
although i'm kind of stuck up on a

4186.839 --> 4189.839
subject

4210.239 --> 4216.879999999999
so yeah if any of you guys had more

4213.36 --> 4219.92
questions perhaps

4216.88 --> 4220.8
some good questions about cosmogenes

4219.92 --> 4223.36
first with like

4220.8 --> 4225.4400000000005
explaining the looping concept what is

4223.36 --> 4225.44
it

4228.32 --> 4233.36
is rumpus andrew thomas young

4231.28 --> 4234.639999999999
[Laughter]

4233.36 --> 4238.5599999999995
[Music]

4234.64 --> 4238.56
oh dear god wouldn't that be something

4242.96 --> 4245.84
that's

4246.96 --> 4251.76
well technically nobody knows who rumpus

4249.6 --> 4251.76
is

4253.36 --> 4258.639999999999
you know it could be anyone like he

4256.239 --> 4261.36
always has that little photo of himself

4258.64 --> 4263.679
you know with the beer in his hand and

4261.36 --> 4264.96
the cool looking glass yeah the

4263.679 --> 4267.28
sunglasses

4264.96 --> 4273.84
but you don't necessarily even know

4267.28 --> 4273.84
that's him

4274.88 --> 4277.52
who cares

4279.199 --> 4287.839999999999
uh well if he would be andrew thomas

4283.76 --> 4287.84
young that would be hilarious

4298.32 --> 4305.599999999999
isn't that the pick of my british miners

4303.28 --> 4309.12
i don't know more color i have no idea

4305.6 --> 4315.84
do you recognize the picture of romp

4309.12 --> 4315.84
i have no idea

4340.84 --> 4343.84
um

4346.4 --> 4351.5199999999995
okay mark collard you were told that

4351.84 --> 4355.76
so could you perhaps trace that back as

4354.56 --> 4359.04
to

4355.76 --> 4360.96
the name you know a minor celebrity

4359.04 --> 4363.12
that's all really nice but

4360.96 --> 4364.96
who is it you know are there more

4363.12 --> 4367.599999999999
pictures of that guy that would be

4364.96 --> 4369.199
funny because i always thought that it

4367.6 --> 4371.6
was rhompus

4369.199 --> 4372.5599999999995
but yeah technically i don't know i

4371.6 --> 4375.280000000001
don't know what he's

4372.56 --> 4375.280000000001
what he looks like

4378.159 --> 4383.36
it's in a way like even him

4381.199 --> 4385.199
yeah now that you're saying it like the

4383.36 --> 4385.92
guy holding the beer in that picture

4385.199 --> 4388.08
that seems

4385.92 --> 4391.28
very unrumpus i don't see rumpus

4388.08 --> 4391.28
drinking beer at all

4392.08 --> 4399.84
doesn't seem like the type for that

4398.08 --> 4403.36
with the way he goes about in his voice

4399.84 --> 4403.360000000001
and all that yeah

4404.239 --> 4408.53
he'd probably get really loopy

4407.6 --> 4411.76
with alcohol

4408.53 --> 4414.639999999999
[Laughter]

4411.76 --> 4414.64
he'd lose track

4418.64 --> 4423.52
ah more colored we'll never know who

4421.199 --> 4427.28
rompus really is

4423.52 --> 4428.88
it's the ultimate mystery it's the last

4427.28 --> 4430.719
remaining mystery

4428.88 --> 4433.28
because everything else about his

4430.719 --> 4435.6
objective his methods

4433.28 --> 4438.4
his ways of doing things are all exposed

4435.6 --> 4441.84
so it will be the last remaining mystery

4438.4 --> 4441.839999999999
who actually is he

4445.84 --> 4450.64
wondering his age uh

4450.8 --> 4455.76
well i think that his voice does make

4453.28 --> 4457.599999999999
him sound younger than he probably is

4455.76 --> 4460.08
but i don't know he could i think he's

4457.6 --> 4460.08
probably

4460.239 --> 4464.959999999999
either in his late 30s or maybe even in

4463.199 --> 4467.5199999999995
his 50s

4464.96 --> 4470.32
somewhere in between that he's not a

4467.52 --> 4470.320000000001
very young guy

4476.96 --> 4483.84
say 40 what i'm i'm secretly rompus

4485.76 --> 4497.679
maybe yeah maybe you're right good sir

4487.28 --> 4500.719
maybe he is 40. could be

4497.679 --> 4501.92
he does you you do realize that when he

4500.719 --> 4504.88
talks

4501.92 --> 4506.2390000000005
he does often take the social position

4504.88 --> 4508.8
of an elder

4506.239 --> 4511.199
like he does talk about the youth and

4508.8 --> 4515.1990000000005
the young people at times you know

4511.199 --> 4518.0
so i think he he might actually be oh he

4515.199 --> 4525.839999999999
might be like in his 50s or something

4518.0 --> 4525.84
and he just sounds younger

4531.84 --> 4540.4800000000005
right resta yeah it could be

4535.36 --> 4540.48
there 50 yeah anyways

4543.84 --> 4549.92
who knows you know maybe rumpus at some

4546.32 --> 4553.12
point will just reveal his face

4549.92 --> 4555.36
who knows so many of the other ballers

4553.12 --> 4555.36
have

4561.92 --> 4569.04
just no it's good servant

4565.36 --> 4571.839999999999
no rumpus is definitely not

4569.04 --> 4571.84
eric dube

4574.239 --> 4581.839999999999
that's that's hilarious

4592.84 --> 4598.08
uh

4594.88 --> 4600.719
steve where's steve i don't see steve

4598.08 --> 4600.719
in my chat

4603.28 --> 4609.84
oh you mean a good servant yeah

4614.56 --> 4623.84
right right

4625.36 --> 4630.719
no but that that can't work erector bay

4628.0 --> 4633.76
doesn't have that voice

4630.719 --> 4636.08
he can't talk like that he's very he's

4633.76 --> 4638.08
eric dubai is not very good in doing

4636.08 --> 4642.5599999999995
voice impressions at all

4638.08 --> 4642.5599999999995
he's very stuck to his his voice

4645.92 --> 4648.96
have you noticed that not everybody has

4648.4 --> 4652.639999999999
that

4648.96 --> 4656.159
quality you know i can make voices

4652.64 --> 4658.64
i can emulate i'm like a parrot

4656.159 --> 4665.839999999999
but yeah i just happen to have that not

4658.64 --> 4665.84
everybody's born with that

4672.4 --> 4679.839999999999
all right more color yoga teacher's

4676.84 --> 4679.84
voice

4684.08 --> 4687.04
oh god

4690.64 --> 4707.84
oh damn yeah that's that's true

4694.96 --> 4707.84
it's true ah thank you for that

4718.84 --> 4725.4400000000005
uh

4720.719 --> 4725.44
eric is brenda come on

4727.12 --> 4733.599999999999
oh god oh god

4730.32 --> 4737.599999999999
why did you have to say that that's

4733.6 --> 4739.84
yeah technically technically

4737.6 --> 4742.159000000001
this voice range he could actually do

4739.84 --> 4742.159000000001
that

4744.56 --> 4750.080000000001
oh god would i i don't think nah

4751.84 --> 4758.64
that's weird man

4755.12 --> 4761.679
but he could probably act like brenda

4758.64 --> 4763.04
if he really wanted to or if he had a

4761.679 --> 4776.719
point

4763.04 --> 4790.96
to make

4776.719 --> 4794.88
yeah i personally like doing chickies

4790.96 --> 4797.6
especially when he says yes yes

4794.88 --> 4799.4400000000005
it's it's so hilarious to me every time

4797.6 --> 4805.84
he does that

4799.44 --> 4805.839999999999
just makes me giggle uh

4806.74 --> 4809.849999999999
[Music]

4812.32 --> 4819.84
no this is going too far no

4822.56 --> 4827.120000000001
no joe rogan has a much lower voice he

4825.44 --> 4828.799999999999
couldn't do that

4827.12 --> 4833.84
he sounds really silly when he does a

4828.8 --> 4833.84
high voice

4848.32 --> 4851.92
yeah it's a bit silly this isn't it

4852.4 --> 4856.719
talking about who could act like who out

4854.96 --> 4861.12
there

4856.719 --> 4863.679
right but i think that yeah brenda and

4861.12 --> 4865.199
and rumpus are probably unique

4863.679 --> 4867.1990000000005
individuals

4865.199 --> 4868.96
and they're just not very comfortable in

4867.199 --> 4874.0
sharing their likeness

4868.96 --> 4889.84
with the world like i am for example

4874.0 --> 4889.84
many others

4891.44 --> 4897.36
yeah mark collard we know

4894.8 --> 4897.360000000001
