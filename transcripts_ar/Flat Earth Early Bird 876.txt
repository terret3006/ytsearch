yeah weather today again

84.56 --> 89.119
it's quite beautiful it started out a

88.24 --> 91.759
bit

89.119 --> 91.759
grayish

92.96 --> 96.24
like there was a lot of moist in the air

94.88 --> 99.28
but now it's kind of

96.24 --> 101.36
like the sun seems to have heated up the

99.28 --> 104.479
place and

101.36 --> 104.479
it's all cleared off

107.36 --> 114.24
it's really beautiful well

111.28 --> 115.68
practically cloudless day a couple of

114.24 --> 119.19999999999999
hazy clouds

115.68 --> 121.36000000000001
far in the distance a lot of blue sky

119.2 --> 124.88
not deep blue

121.36 --> 128.8
but still very much blue and the sun is

124.88 --> 132.47899999999998
shining bright

128.8 --> 132.479
trees are still blossoming

143.2 --> 145.51999999999998
so

149.36 --> 157.84
it's tuesday the 27th

152.4 --> 157.84
of april 2021

158.48 --> 162.23899999999998
welcome to the flat earth early bird

168.84 --> 172.92000000000002
show

170.56 --> 175.2
right so

172.92 --> 177.83999999999997
[Music]

175.2 --> 177.83999999999997
let's see

179.84 --> 185.36
hey hello tom parker first in chat good

182.4 --> 188.959
to see you

185.36 --> 188.959
hope others will follow soon

191.84 --> 200.64000000000001
i may get flat side on

195.92 --> 202.39999999999998
in a skype call already asked him

200.64 --> 204.39999999999998
pretty much was okay with it even though

202.4 --> 207.519
he was kind of busy right now

204.4 --> 207.519
editing a video

207.84 --> 213.36
right all relating to the whole ranty

211.92 --> 217.04
conspiracy cats

213.36 --> 217.04000000000002
picture situation and all that

217.84 --> 221.28
you missed yesterday's show just too

220.08 --> 224.799
busy

221.28 --> 228.159
yeah okay i thought you were on there

224.799 --> 230.87900000000002
in the chat or anyway

228.159 --> 232.959
i did actually watch the first half of

230.879 --> 241.84
yesterday's show back

232.959 --> 241.84
just to see what it was like and

244.48 --> 252.39999999999998
right even though like

247.76 --> 255.2
it was just i i was laid back in a way

252.4 --> 255.519
but also it stood out that my voice was

255.2 --> 259.12
like

255.519 --> 262.32
particularly monotonous that was weird

259.12 --> 265.199
realizing that as i watch back i didn't

262.32 --> 265.199
really like that

265.759 --> 269.68
but maybe it's because i was basically

268.639 --> 272.0
compressing

269.68 --> 273.68
well a lot of tension that's been on me

272.0 --> 276.639
for a while

273.68 --> 278.8
maybe today's show will be different

276.639 --> 281.28000000000003
basically had

278.8 --> 283.44
have postponed it for way too long but i

281.28 --> 285.19899999999996
talked to my other roommate

283.44 --> 287.52
that have been living has been living

285.199 --> 289.52000000000004
here longer

287.52 --> 290.71999999999997
and he seemed very willing to help me

289.52 --> 294.4
out

290.72 --> 298.56
so that gave me a lot of hope

294.4 --> 300.4
hope it lasts i think it will because

298.56 --> 301.84
while this guy's been living there for

300.4 --> 303.67999999999995
over two years

301.84 --> 304.96
he kind of knows what the landlord's

303.68 --> 308.56
like

304.96 --> 310.08
uh and yeah he's not in any direct

308.56 --> 311.919
threat to be kicked out of the room

310.08 --> 313.12
because he's living living there longer

311.919 --> 315.84
than a year

313.12 --> 317.919
right so it makes sense and to me it's

315.84 --> 320.63899999999995
just very hopeful

317.919 --> 321.919
i really needed that because like the

320.639 --> 324.96000000000004
the shadow has

321.919 --> 328.56
had been creeping

324.96 --> 332.32
in the background for a while

328.56 --> 335.68
so just that positive point really kind

332.32 --> 335.68
of brightened my day

336.32 --> 340.639
uh what is up with ranty was he ever a

339.12 --> 343.919
flat earther

340.639 --> 352.88
no no he's a special boy earther he's

343.919 --> 356.4
he's a ranty earther

352.88 --> 359.52
like i i i'm still not gonna

356.4 --> 361.84
like literally just

359.52 --> 363.52
talk about private conversations we had

361.84 --> 365.75899999999996
before

363.52 --> 368.4
yeah he basically kind of start stabbing

365.759 --> 368.40000000000003
me in the back

368.96 --> 375.84
and all that and i got really pissed off

372.72 --> 376.56
but what i just got from it is that he

375.84 --> 381.35999999999996
kind of just

376.56 --> 384.24
likes doing this he likes the attention

381.36 --> 385.199
and yeah he's not completely without

384.24 --> 388.40000000000003
skills

385.199 --> 389.68
but he just doesn't seem to have any

388.4 --> 392.84
anchoring

389.68 --> 394.72
in the material too much is that

392.84 --> 397.11999999999995
egomania

394.72 --> 397.12
maybe

397.759 --> 404.40000000000003
it certainly does have it at time but so

401.199 --> 407.6
for ranty from what i gather is

404.4 --> 409.84
it's more just about getting the

407.6 --> 411.36
attention being in the spotlight for

409.84 --> 413.11999999999995
whatever he doesn't seem

411.36 --> 414.96000000000004
like he really doesn't seem to mind

413.12 --> 416.88
whether it's for something bad or for

414.96 --> 420.15999999999997
something good

416.88 --> 421.28
and i think he's just kind of like he's

420.16 --> 423.59900000000005
taking a turn

421.28 --> 426.479
he doesn't give a [ __ ] and he now is

423.599 --> 429.599
playing on the baller side

426.479 --> 432.0
you could almost say that as i have this

429.599 --> 432.0
weird

432.24 --> 437.919
heliocentric fetish where i like

435.28 --> 440.08
still remember everything i did as a

437.919 --> 443.28
baller

440.08 --> 444.96
with that i still have that and i still

443.28 --> 447.039
have passion for that i still have a

444.96 --> 448.4
vision for the dual cosmogonical society

447.039 --> 450.71999999999997
and i might end up

448.4 --> 453.12
correcting ballers or even giving them

450.72 --> 456.24
hints on where to go

453.12 --> 459.52
beyond just total doublethink

456.24 --> 462.72
maybe ranty is doing it

459.52 --> 466.31899999999996
in his own way but actually yeah

462.72 --> 470.24
going way further and just going

466.319 --> 470.24
like in a game undercover

472.4 --> 476.479
right because after everything that's

474.879 --> 479.59900000000005
happened

476.479 --> 481.28
this it makes no logical sense for him

479.599 --> 484.319
to truly be a baller

481.28 --> 484.31899999999996
it really doesn't

486.96 --> 493.84
hello territ 306 and amanda young

497.28 --> 503.35999999999996
yeah tiny wombo i know that's that's

499.84 --> 503.35999999999996
exactly what he's doing it for

505.12 --> 508.72
he's he's trying to spice enough the

507.52 --> 512.16
scene

508.72 --> 512.1600000000001
pass out some false hope

512.88 --> 516.32
and i don't know man maybe he's getting

515.12 --> 519.519
sponsored for that

516.32 --> 520.08
maybe i don't know i don't think he

519.519 --> 523.36
would

520.08 --> 525.6800000000001
at this point shy away from any kind of

523.36 --> 527.12
income resources no matter where it's

525.68 --> 529.68
coming from

527.12 --> 531.68
because he likes to he likes to gamble

529.68 --> 537.3599999999999
with that [ __ ]

531.68 --> 537.3599999999999
he likes to get get freaky

537.519 --> 541.52
he thinks it's exciting right that's

540.88 --> 544.32
it's time

541.52 --> 547.1999999999999
[Music]

544.32 --> 547.519
not saying that he is doing that but to

547.2 --> 549.6800000000001
me

547.519 --> 552.399
it's just blatantly obvious he is

549.68 --> 552.399
undercover

553.92 --> 558.0
for himself potentially right doesn't

556.24 --> 560.24
necessarily mean he has

558.0 --> 562.56
like an agenda with somebody else he's

560.24 --> 567.76
just decided to go and do this

562.56 --> 567.76
and look at how easy ballers are just

567.839 --> 574.0
autopilot responding to it

570.88 --> 575.519
even like tiny womble who doesn't really

574.0 --> 578.56
know randy

575.519 --> 582.24
personally i think

578.56 --> 582.2399999999999
that's just a standard response

588.08 --> 591.12
he's yeah the other yeah those other

590.64 --> 594.48
shows

591.12 --> 597.92
right tiny wumbo but yet he was

594.48 --> 601.04
on brandon's yesterday

597.92 --> 604.16
ranty was on brandon's yesterday so

601.04 --> 607.12
he's not really stepped away like what

604.16 --> 607.12
you're suggesting

608.399 --> 619.839
hey ralph rodriguez good to see you

621.92 --> 627.76
how much time it takes to set up daily

625.519 --> 627.76
show

630.16 --> 633.8389999999999
about five to ten minutes really

635.44 --> 639.36
but to basically get ready to do a show

638.399 --> 647.279
that's different

639.36 --> 650.88
like i have to be like in the zone

647.279 --> 652.0
all that right so depending on what i'm

650.88 --> 654.32
feeling like

652.0 --> 655.92
that can take a while like i can be

654.32 --> 657.6800000000001
really caught up in something that i

655.92 --> 659.04
definitely don't want to talk about on

657.68 --> 661.1999999999999
the show

659.04 --> 662.88
and then i have to wind that down that

661.2 --> 666.1600000000001
couldn't take time sometimes

662.88 --> 667.76
but luckily i i tend to not

666.16 --> 669.279
get caught up in such things right

667.76 --> 672.3199999999999
before the show

669.279 --> 675.8389999999999
i used to though like years ago that

672.32 --> 675.839
happened a lot back then

681.44 --> 685.9200000000001
yes i have watched the movie level tom

683.6 --> 689.839
parker i did

685.92 --> 689.8389999999999
i reviewed it a few days ago

692.079 --> 694.399
was it

695.519 --> 703.839
yeah last week

718.72 --> 725.6
i thought it was really good yeah well

722.48 --> 729.279
it was at least very decent right

725.6 --> 733.0400000000001
it was at least not

729.279 --> 736.56
some edited hit piece

733.04 --> 739.519
like beyond the curve was

736.56 --> 741.1199999999999
it was definitely made by these guys

739.519 --> 741.92
they had full control over its

741.12 --> 745.12
production

741.92 --> 748.16
and yeah that show that that showed

745.12 --> 749.36
so it was definitely a decent production

748.16 --> 753.1999999999999
as i'd like to call it

749.36 --> 754.9590000000001
but yeah technically it wasn't perfect

753.2 --> 758.5600000000001
there were some

754.959 --> 761.04
weird tough to say

758.56 --> 762.16
lower tier arguments being used in there

761.04 --> 764.3199999999999
but then again

762.16 --> 765.92
if you regard the whole thing as a

764.32 --> 769.7600000000001
stepping stone

765.92 --> 771.8389999999999
for newbies then it's actually

769.76 --> 772.959
probably really effective more effective

771.839 --> 776.0790000000001
than if you would just

772.959 --> 777.279
unleash our wind level stuff because a

776.079 --> 781.4399999999999
lot of newbies are like

777.279 --> 785.04
what the [ __ ] is he talking about

781.44 --> 788.48
like oh yeah looping irregular looping

785.04 --> 791.68
flat earth with end of

788.48 --> 794.8000000000001
space non-physical dome and

791.68 --> 797.519
like all those weird concepts

794.8 --> 800.0
yeah better and the holographic globe of

797.519 --> 802.48
the heavens non-local

800.0 --> 804.0
personal light with non-sources like

802.48 --> 806.88
yeah if you tell that a new

804.0 --> 809.2
newbie they'll be like what the hell is

806.88 --> 809.2
this

809.279 --> 815.76
so yeah to take that lower tier approach

813.839 --> 816.8000000000001
don't mean to be arrogant it's just what

815.76 --> 820.079
it is

816.8 --> 821.68
yeah that'll probably get a lot more

820.079 --> 825.4399999999999
people to basically like

821.68 --> 826.959
maybe this is worth exploring

825.44 --> 829.519
after everything that's happened out

826.959 --> 831.5999999999999
there

829.519 --> 843.839
so yeah i thought it was definitely a

831.6 --> 843.839
decent documentary

864.079 --> 867.92
a lot of info one hour right yes tom

867.36 --> 871.04
parker

867.92 --> 874.4799999999999
well you know what

871.04 --> 875.36
you might have a point if i'd bump into

874.48 --> 878.399
somebody

875.36 --> 879.12
that was completely new to flat earth

878.399 --> 882.639
and they

879.12 --> 886.0
like not even like people that are

882.639 --> 888.32
on youtube get in my chat or

886.0 --> 890.399
get on the flat earth debate that

888.32 --> 893.7600000000001
doesn't happen unless you're not really

890.399 --> 896.079
a newbie anymore right that

893.76 --> 897.12
you would have to have the intuition to

896.079 --> 899.04
dig

897.12 --> 901.279
through it all and then actually

899.04 --> 904.399
recognize the flat earth debate

901.279 --> 904.399
for what it really is

904.639 --> 911.04
that it's that it's a really focused

908.0 --> 912.32
place and maybe pick up on what i'm

911.04 --> 914.3199999999999
doing as well right

912.32 --> 916.24
you'd already have to have some kind of

914.32 --> 920.8000000000001
a

916.24 --> 923.04
thread to lead you from within

920.8 --> 925.12
but if i'd like bump on the straight or

923.04 --> 926.7199999999999
something got to talk and then like hey

925.12 --> 928.88
flat earth slightly earth

926.72 --> 930.0790000000001
i think i would at this point then tell

928.88 --> 932.079
them hey

930.079 --> 934.079
if you want to know some basics watch

932.079 --> 936.0
the documentary level

934.079 --> 937.519
right and then after that come back to

936.0 --> 941.839
me

937.519 --> 941.839
i'd probably do that

942.48 --> 945.9200000000001
but if it's just people that have

944.8 --> 948.639
already found me

945.92 --> 950.8
on youtube yet then then i'm just going

948.639 --> 955.839
to try to do it

950.8 --> 955.8389999999999
more on our win level

957.199 --> 963.199
all right nathan r that's interesting

960.88 --> 963.199
cool

967.199 --> 971.68
right so how about your sister though

972.48 --> 976.0
does she like who's married to your

974.639 --> 979.12
brother-in-law

976.0 --> 980.079
does she also side with that otherwise

979.12 --> 983.759
there might be

980.079 --> 987.68
some issues like it's very tough

983.759 --> 997.839
for a couple if one is a flat earther

987.68 --> 997.8389999999999
and the other isn't

1004.8 --> 1012.959
all right well tara 306

1009.839 --> 1014.8800000000001
cell yeah yeah you're talking with tiny

1012.959 --> 1017.5999999999999
womble here about

1014.88 --> 1019.92
if a globe indoctrinated person becomes

1017.6 --> 1022.839
flat earther and no problem but then

1019.92 --> 1024.0
becomes a globe it means he sells out

1022.839 --> 1027.039
well

1024.0 --> 1028.959
sells out or chickens out right it

1027.039 --> 1029.199
doesn't necessarily have to be selling

1028.959 --> 1031.439
out

1029.199 --> 1033.76
unless you call chickening out selling

1031.439 --> 1037.8390000000002
out as well

1033.76 --> 1041.039
right because

1037.839 --> 1043.839
focusing on flat earthing

1041.039 --> 1044.959
and then because of it basically seeing

1043.839 --> 1048.559
the distinction

1044.959 --> 1052.24
so much in everybody

1048.559 --> 1055.44
that's a strain and for some people

1052.24 --> 1058.0
it's just too much they don't want it

1055.44 --> 1058.64
they find out when they get really

1058.0 --> 1061.919
serious

1058.64 --> 1064.3200000000002
they find like it's not completely

1061.919 --> 1065.1200000000001
at this point in this society without a

1064.32 --> 1067.12
price

1065.12 --> 1068.6399999999999
it is a form of rebellion and that's

1067.12 --> 1073.12
very tough in

1068.64 --> 1076.72
in a 1984 society

1073.12 --> 1078.4799999999998
so some people just chickened out

1076.72 --> 1081.28
they're basically stepping away because

1078.48 --> 1084.48
of cowardice

1081.28 --> 1087.52
right it's not necessarily that

1084.48 --> 1089.76
they have a financial incentive

1087.52 --> 1091.76
although they can't fully exclude it i

1089.76 --> 1092.24
don't know how what's going on out there

1091.76 --> 1095.84
right

1092.24 --> 1098.16
if like bosses or whatever actually

1095.84 --> 1099.76
are so weird with the globe that if they

1098.16 --> 1102.8400000000001
find out one of their employees is a

1099.76 --> 1105.679
flat earther that they would try to like

1102.84 --> 1106.8799999999999
incentivize them to stop or something i

1105.679 --> 1109.919
don't know

1106.88 --> 1112.88
i don't know what's going on out there i

1109.919 --> 1117.919
don't have a lot of experience with like

1112.88 --> 1117.919
jobs and employees and all that

1118.0 --> 1127.2
and bosses and what goes on

1122.799 --> 1127.2
but it could be anyway

1129.2 --> 1132.4
all right he wants is subs big eu with

1131.28 --> 1135.6789999999999
no following

1132.4 --> 1138.72
i wouldn't say that tom parker look

1135.679 --> 1138.72
ranty has

1138.799 --> 1146.48
despite everything has skills and

1142.48 --> 1150.08
he's this he's done a lot of different

1146.48 --> 1153.1200000000001
things but yeah not all good

1150.08 --> 1153.9189999999999
with them so there's definitely people

1153.12 --> 1156.3999999999999
that are kind of

1153.919 --> 1157.8400000000001
interested in his activities pretty much

1156.4 --> 1159.2
no matter what they are

1157.84 --> 1161.1999999999998
right not that they're going to hang a

1159.2 --> 1165.8400000000001
lot of weight on it but he does have

1161.2 --> 1165.8400000000001
people's interests

1166.559 --> 1170.48
so he's trying stuff out not always good

1170.0 --> 1174.08
stuff

1170.48 --> 1175.3600000000001
but he's trying stuff out right so he's

1174.08 --> 1176.08
probably not gonna have a lot of

1175.36 --> 1178.3999999999999
personal

1176.08 --> 1179.4399999999998
loyalty towards him but there are

1178.4 --> 1182.64
definitely people

1179.44 --> 1182.64
interested in what he does

1183.44 --> 1187.2
right don't underestimate that

1188.32 --> 1193.84
he would have probably given up a long

1190.08 --> 1193.84
time ago if he didn't

1198.09 --> 1204.3999999999999
[Music]

1202.88 --> 1206.88
interview yeah i heard about that i

1204.4 --> 1221.8400000000001
haven't watched anything though

1206.88 --> 1221.8400000000001
an interview with fight to flat earth

1233.679 --> 1238.64
kiwi crushed ranty yeah

1240.32 --> 1244.08
it's not really difficult you know

1246.799 --> 1254.32
like i could spend a lot of time just oh

1250.24 --> 1254.32
rented this ranty that but

1261.44 --> 1268.0800000000002
right in the past i already explained

1264.88 --> 1269.8400000000001
enough and hey if i get

1268.08 --> 1271.52
trolled by him and he does that

1269.84 --> 1274.84
sometimes or whatever

1271.52 --> 1277.84
yeah i will lay that out on the table

1274.84 --> 1277.84
again

1284.32 --> 1291.84
all right anyways

1310.96 --> 1315.28
one of my favorite is when i went off on

1314.4 --> 1319.8400000000001
kiwi or re

1315.28 --> 1319.84
i did from when

1326.0 --> 1331.2
a while ago right yeah well we've had a

1328.559 --> 1334.48
couple of bumpings

1331.2 --> 1337.2
right like even monday yesterday i had

1334.48 --> 1338.64
that [ __ ] like on the flat earth debates

1337.2 --> 1343.3600000000001
really early

1338.64 --> 1343.3600000000001
there was a lot of tension on me still

1343.6 --> 1348.799
and then like i i don't really speak up

1347.36 --> 1350.8799999999999
that much

1348.799 --> 1353.2
at the flat earth debates like in the

1350.88 --> 1356.24
recent period especially because just

1353.2 --> 1359.1200000000001
they're on this picture again

1356.24 --> 1360.0
and to be fair those mechanics i'm

1359.12 --> 1362.1589999999999
getting kind of bored

1360.0 --> 1363.28
about it right doesn't mean you should

1362.159 --> 1365.919
be but

1363.28 --> 1367.6789999999999
for me it's like yeah this is kind of

1365.919 --> 1371.44
pointless now

1367.679 --> 1374.88
like the overarching mechanics just

1371.44 --> 1375.919
there's no more need horizon really

1374.88 --> 1379.1200000000001
isn't earth curve

1375.919 --> 1383.2
like the black swan really just

1379.12 --> 1385.36
unravels it and you only need one

1383.2 --> 1387.039
right and i understand exactly how that

1385.36 --> 1389.84
all works now

1387.039 --> 1390.72
so to me it's kind of like recycling old

1389.84 --> 1392.6399999999999
toys

1390.72 --> 1394.08
and i'm kind of like done playing with

1392.64 --> 1397.44
that

1394.08 --> 1399.6
but yeah i was

1397.44 --> 1400.96
acting like a globe or for a bit like

1399.6 --> 1402.8799999999999
trying to challenge

1400.96 --> 1404.72
a housekeeping question gas pressure

1402.88 --> 1406.5590000000002
without a container

1404.72 --> 1408.08
and for some reason that really

1406.559 --> 1411.76
triggered elijah because

1408.08 --> 1413.84
like halfway my inquiry

1411.76 --> 1416.0
he just started rumpusing me and not

1413.84 --> 1418.72
just for a few seconds but like

1416.0 --> 1421.6
30 seconds straight and that really

1418.72 --> 1421.6000000000001
pissed me off

1421.84 --> 1425.279
so that happened yesterday during the

1423.6 --> 1428.3999999999999
live show in the beginning

1425.279 --> 1432.799
it's weird right so sometimes

1428.4 --> 1433.44
i do just do that to kind of like remind

1432.799 --> 1438.72
people like

1433.44 --> 1438.72
uh yeah i demand some respect

1440.24 --> 1448.08
right like i'm very dynamic but don't

1444.48 --> 1450.88
start just walking over my feet like

1448.08 --> 1450.8799999999999
it's nothing right

1457.279 --> 1460.4
and i don't think there was any hard

1458.96 --> 1463.2
feel he was a bit pissed

1460.4 --> 1464.159
off that i went off on him but afterward

1463.2 --> 1466.64
after the

1464.159 --> 1467.44
the after show was over like we still

1466.64 --> 1470.48
had like a

1467.44 --> 1473.279
very long conversation afterward and i

1470.48 --> 1475.52
think everything was fine

1473.279 --> 1475.52
so

1479.44 --> 1485.44
but sometimes this happens with qe2

1483.039 --> 1486.8799999999999
or well not so much recently but in the

1485.44 --> 1488.96
past

1486.88 --> 1490.3200000000002
that i just like get really pissed off

1488.96 --> 1492.0
or something

1490.32 --> 1493.9189999999999
and then he would get like almost

1492.0 --> 1496.32
foaming at the mouth

1493.919 --> 1498.159
but then i just leave it he might be

1496.32 --> 1499.2
pissed off and then the next day he's

1498.159 --> 1502.48
kind of like

1499.2 --> 1502.48
let it sink and then

1503.279 --> 1512.32
not really hell bent on hammering it

1507.52 --> 1513.12
in my head like reestablishing dominance

1512.32 --> 1516.0
again

1513.12 --> 1517.6
in the argument which i basically yeah

1516.0 --> 1521.039
was defending against

1517.6 --> 1529.84
right so it's

1521.039 --> 1529.84
it's all pretty balanced

1536.96 --> 1540.4
all right yeah tiny bumble

1541.12 --> 1549.36
yeah you're you're pretty mellow

1545.2 --> 1552.0
for glober and you're not

1549.36 --> 1553.6
really pushy right you're still a glober

1552.0 --> 1555.679
you still have the effect

1553.6 --> 1557.52
you still have the compulsive reactions

1555.679 --> 1560.5590000000002
and all that

1557.52 --> 1564.799
but you're just modest and i

1560.559 --> 1564.799
appreciate you as a glober in my chat

1566.08 --> 1571.84
and you've been here for a while is it

1568.08 --> 1571.84
like at least a year

1583.69 --> 1586.88
[Music]

1588.96 --> 1593.679
i hope by the way you've reconsidered

1591.36 --> 1596.8799999999999
taking that vaccine

1593.679 --> 1599.679
and we discussed like a month ago

1596.88 --> 1602.4
i hope by now that you're not gonna do

1599.679 --> 1602.4
that anymore

1603.2 --> 1609.68
it's just so much data come out like

1606.48 --> 1611.76
you really shouldn't be doing that

1609.68 --> 1627.8400000000001
[Music]

1611.76 --> 1627.84
what ralph rodriguez

1632.64 --> 1638.3200000000002
right yes tiny womble yeah i do

1639.36 --> 1642.8799999999999
and sometimes i like to from a neutral

1642.24 --> 1645.76
position

1642.88 --> 1648.0
like to hear what globers think about it

1645.76 --> 1651.12
without them just

1648.0 --> 1654.159
using the opportunity to do some kind of

1651.12 --> 1656.1589999999999
political invasion of space

1654.159 --> 1658.96
right and attention which is what a lot

1656.159 --> 1658.96
of globals do

1666.48 --> 1670.0
and you don't tend to do that and i

1668.32 --> 1683.84
appreciate that

1670.0 --> 1683.84
hello championator

1689.44 --> 1697.8400000000001
what do you what is pretty strange aro

1691.52 --> 1697.84
for drives

1713.039 --> 1717.76
yeah tom parker that that's kind of mean

1715.84 --> 1719.6789999999999
to say that i don't know why you

1717.76 --> 1721.52
said that i always have a good show

1719.679 --> 1726.5590000000002
without you

1721.52 --> 1726.559
it's like no just leave him alone

1733.52 --> 1736.68
[Music]

1736.84 --> 1740.6399999999999
right

1738.08 --> 1743.36
a global would hang out here why is that

1740.64 --> 1743.3600000000001
so strange

1746.399 --> 1753.279
i do entertain elements to the globe

1750.799 --> 1754.48
i do like like the construction of it

1753.279 --> 1757.52
sometimes to

1754.48 --> 1757.52
just go through it

1763.52 --> 1766.8799999999999
right and i've had quite a few globers

1766.08 --> 1770.08
here

1766.88 --> 1772.159
it's just that a lot of the times at

1770.08 --> 1774.559
some point they kind of like

1772.159 --> 1775.6000000000001
lose their composure and they get all

1774.559 --> 1779.6
triggered

1775.6 --> 1781.52
and start like getting really nasty and

1779.6 --> 1782.7199999999998
that's when i basically have to remove

1781.52 --> 1784.799
them

1782.72 --> 1786.24
but yeah the same goes even for regular

1784.799 --> 1789.44
flat earthers on other

1786.24 --> 1791.36
subjects right so i basically judge

1789.44 --> 1792.96
people not whether they're flat earthers

1791.36 --> 1809.12
or globers i just

1792.96 --> 1812.08
judge them on their behavior

1809.12 --> 1812.6399999999999
i wouldn't hang out at ball channels

1812.08 --> 1815.9189999999999
well

1812.64 --> 1819.3600000000001
yeah i get that ralph rodriguez

1815.919 --> 1822.3200000000002
but sometimes sometimes it can actually

1819.36 --> 1826.24
be interesting right

1822.32 --> 1830.8799999999999
it's look let me share a little inside

1826.24 --> 1832.72
info on that ballers among themselves

1830.88 --> 1834.48
can have kind of interesting

1832.72 --> 1836.559
conversation

1834.48 --> 1838.24
when they're not like hell-bent or

1836.559 --> 1840.6399999999999
politically bound

1838.24 --> 1842.08
to basically talk about some flat

1840.64 --> 1842.96
earthers and why they're wrong and

1842.08 --> 1845.039
stupid

1842.96 --> 1846.159
but when they just talk among themselves

1845.039 --> 1849.52
about

1846.159 --> 1849.5200000000002
stuff that they're dealing with

1849.679 --> 1854.88
it's actually kind of interesting right

1852.96 --> 1856.88
it's when they get really put yeah

1854.88 --> 1859.279
triggered like against

1856.88 --> 1861.44
flat earthers that they get annoying and

1859.279 --> 1864.559
get on your under your skin and all that

1861.44 --> 1867.3600000000001
but if that doesn't happen it they're

1864.559 --> 1869.519
not all that bad

1867.36 --> 1870.4799999999998
at least some of them there's some of

1869.519 --> 1873.679
them are just

1870.48 --> 1876.72
really crazy right

1873.679 --> 1878.159
but i've even in discord hang in like

1876.72 --> 1881.84
after show

1878.159 --> 1883.44
rooms when it's all ballers just talking

1881.84 --> 1884.08
about themselves just to listen in

1883.44 --> 1886.96
because it

1884.08 --> 1887.4399999999998
it can actually be halfway interesting

1886.96 --> 1890.88
and

1887.44 --> 1894.3200000000002
not unpleasant to listen to so right

1890.88 --> 1897.279
it's really the whole polarization

1894.32 --> 1898.32
that makes it so annoying but that's

1897.279 --> 1900.88
also

1898.32 --> 1903.519
because of what you do with it if you're

1900.88 --> 1905.6000000000001
not going to be polarized towards them

1903.519 --> 1907.84
they might also stop doing that towards

1905.6 --> 1907.84
you

1910.159 --> 1913.519
your brother wants to fight me when i

1911.84 --> 1921.84
talk about flat earth ugh

1913.519 --> 1921.84
that's that's really annoying

1927.039 --> 1935.84
hey good morning amanda young

1942.66 --> 1945.88
[Music]

1955.12 --> 1963.12
oh and by the way also joseph369

1958.399 --> 1965.039
good to see you

1963.12 --> 1967.5189999999998
wow by the way did you see the down

1965.039 --> 1972.48
votes on yesterday's show

1967.519 --> 1972.48
this is crazy it ended up with -44

1972.64 --> 1977.8400000000001
somebody was really having a bad day

1987.519 --> 1990.72
flat earth separates the thinkers from

1989.76 --> 1995.84
the repeaters

1990.72 --> 1998.24
yeah when it comes to shove it does

1995.84 --> 1999.279
but even globbers yeah they're stuck to

1998.24 --> 2002.3990000000001
their

1999.279 --> 2003.679
their objectives their mechanical

2002.399 --> 2008.6399999999999
objectives

2003.679 --> 2008.64
but in between that there's still

2008.88 --> 2012.7990000000002
there's still some thinking going on to

2011.76 --> 2019.84
me it's kind of

2012.799 --> 2019.84
interesting to see how that works

2020.64 --> 2029.279
right because they're not

2023.919 --> 2032.48
acting like they're constantly lying

2029.279 --> 2046.399
they just really believe it

2032.48 --> 2046.88
and they're they've been yeah did i get

2046.399 --> 2050.0
like an

2046.88 --> 2054.399
auto message from this guy every day now

2050.0 --> 2054.399
so annoying uh

2054.48 --> 2057.52
among themselves

2059.52 --> 2062.8
right they're allowed to yeah it's like

2062.0 --> 2065.839
this they're

2062.8 --> 2067.2000000000003
like forgive they feel like they're

2065.839 --> 2071.04
forgiven

2067.2 --> 2074.3199999999997
for lying or tricking

2071.04 --> 2077.119
if they are defending the globe right

2074.32 --> 2077.52
it's it's just another set of rules it's

2077.119 --> 2081.44
it's

2077.52 --> 2083.839
warped but it is in a way

2081.44 --> 2085.2000000000003
natural it's it's natural in its

2083.839 --> 2087.919
unnaturalness

2085.2 --> 2088.96
it's just another way of doing things

2087.919 --> 2091.2
and

2088.96 --> 2093.599
it yeah it's not like they are like

2091.2 --> 2095.5989999999997
consciously constantly sinning

2093.599 --> 2099.44
right that's not how it works it really

2095.599 --> 2103.28
is like a a religious

2099.44 --> 2106.0
composure like that so

2103.28 --> 2106.5600000000004
when they're not engaging flat earthers

2106.0 --> 2109.92
to go

2106.56 --> 2109.92
to stoop to that level

2110.64 --> 2117.2799999999997
a lot of them can just have really

2114.24 --> 2119.839
interesting thoughts and it's

2117.28 --> 2121.52
interesting also to see basically where

2119.839 --> 2125.44
they're tapping

2121.52 --> 2129.2
their info from what inspires a glober

2125.44 --> 2132.4
where would they typically take

2129.2 --> 2132.7999999999997
their information from right all these

2132.4 --> 2136.1600000000003
things

2132.8 --> 2139.76
that still interests me

2136.16 --> 2141.2
uh hey stopping traffic in my rasta hat

2139.76 --> 2145.8390000000004
neil constantino

2141.2 --> 2145.839
good to see you

2150.72 --> 2156.9599999999996
right oh yeah i said i would maybe have

2154.0 --> 2156.96
somebody call in

2157.28 --> 2161.6800000000003
flat side seems to be afk right now

2162.24 --> 2164.8799999999997
not sure

2165.599 --> 2168.96
but yeah if anybody else would like to

2167.52 --> 2171.92
call in through skype

2168.96 --> 2172.8
i'm available for that and i have the

2171.92 --> 2176.16
sound system

2172.8 --> 2177.92
fixed so there should be no feedback or

2176.16 --> 2187.839
anything

2177.92 --> 2187.839
and just clear sound

2189.92 --> 2195.839
right mouth eyes no one can defend the

2192.16 --> 2195.839
glove and be honest with themselves well

2205.52 --> 2209.119
right at the least you should have

2207.52 --> 2212.839
questions well they do

2209.119 --> 2216.0
they do have questions they just

2212.839 --> 2219.359
de-prioritize those questions

2216.0 --> 2222.56
they put it on the infinite ledger

2219.359 --> 2223.52
they they put it away as in like never

2222.56 --> 2226.32
to address that

2223.52 --> 2228.16
until you've given up the whole thing so

2226.32 --> 2230.32
they just put it on the postpone list

2228.16 --> 2233.359
forever and then they get very apt

2230.32 --> 2233.3590000000004
at avoiding it

2234.079 --> 2243.8390000000004
it's how i did it myself when i was a

2236.32 --> 2243.839
glober i remember that

2248.64 --> 2253.2799999999997
yes i stopping traffic in my restaurant

2254.839 --> 2259.52
indeed

2256.24 --> 2259.52
the effin pave hell

2262.24 --> 2271.839
oh aaron armstrong

2265.359 --> 2271.839
that's so pathetic

2275.28 --> 2281.2000000000003
right like the six-year-old

2278.4 --> 2283.04
just turn it around no you argument

2281.2 --> 2286.3999999999996
really doesn't work

2283.04 --> 2288.48
it really doesn't you just

2286.4 --> 2290.32
sound like a six-year-old that's just

2288.48 --> 2293.599
saying no you

2290.32 --> 2296.079
that's it it's not having the

2293.599 --> 2296.079
effect

2297.359 --> 2301.5989999999997
that you think it may have it's not

2300.72 --> 2304.7999999999997
smart

2301.599 --> 2307.76
it's to literally turn around 180

2304.8 --> 2313.8390000000004
degrees something somebody else says

2307.76 --> 2313.8390000000004
it's not smart

2329.28 --> 2335.52
yeah yeah erin armstrong there is see

2332.32 --> 2337.119
this is what happens this is why aaron

2335.52 --> 2338.839
armstrong has also been banned by the

2337.119 --> 2340.56
way in the past when i unbanned him

2338.839 --> 2343.359
eventually

2340.56 --> 2345.119
he's just unlike tiny wombo has much

2343.359 --> 2346.96
better composure he

2345.119 --> 2349.359
tiny wombo can keep it cool aaron

2346.96 --> 2353.52
armstrong cannot keep it cool

2349.359 --> 2354.48
he cannot he he can't control himself

2353.52 --> 2358.4
with this

2354.48 --> 2369.839
he gets caught up in the polarization

2358.4 --> 2369.839
and then he just goes and does this

2374.16 --> 2377.44
right it's only evidence for flat indeed

2376.88 --> 2381.28
right

2377.44 --> 2385.119
because there's black swan observations

2381.28 --> 2388.079
that means the geometric horizon

2385.119 --> 2388.88
of the presupposed globe earth of that

2388.079 --> 2392.48
specific

2388.88 --> 2394.1600000000003
size that is claimed does not coincide

2392.48 --> 2397.52
with the actual

2394.16 --> 2399.359
perceived horizon right

2397.52 --> 2402.96
the hori you're basically going to have

2399.359 --> 2406.319
to point to some place in a photograph

2402.96 --> 2409.599
just a spot like before

2406.319 --> 2411.119
the apparent horizon the the horizon

2409.599 --> 2413.52
and then just say that is where the

2411.119 --> 2417.2000000000003
geometric horizon is

2413.52 --> 2420.24
and it's refracted right refracted

2417.2 --> 2423.04
terrestrially refracted well guess what

2420.24 --> 2423.68
terrestrial refraction is a science

2423.04 --> 2426.24
fiction

2423.68 --> 2428.48
concept it doesn't exist it's

2426.24 --> 2430.64
paradoxical in nature because if it

2428.48 --> 2432.16
existed then the radius could never have

2430.64 --> 2435.44
been established

2432.16 --> 2437.5989999999997
through science literally like

2435.44 --> 2439.44
the geometry would have always been

2437.599 --> 2441.76
impossible to establish

2439.44 --> 2444.079
through visual if terrestrial refraction

2441.76 --> 2445.6800000000003
existed

2444.079 --> 2447.3590000000004
right and this is what is treated on the

2445.68 --> 2449.52
flat earth debates regularly

2447.359 --> 2451.7599999999998
and rumpus tries to get in there and

2449.52 --> 2454.319
just constantly double think about it

2451.76 --> 2457.76
it's hilarious

2454.319 --> 2460.88
yeah the black swan is a joke right

2457.76 --> 2460.88
well the joke's on you

2461.119 --> 2465.599
terrestrial refraction is a paradox you

2463.52 --> 2467.04
can't use that because if it existed

2465.599 --> 2468.319
then you could have never established

2467.04 --> 2471.44
the radius

2468.319 --> 2471.44
you really couldn't

2472.24 --> 2475.2799999999997
and yeah these black swan observations

2474.88 --> 2479.839
just

2475.28 --> 2481.0400000000004
show there's no earth curve in the way

2479.839 --> 2483.68
and if there's ever

2481.04 --> 2484.48
no earth curve in the way in any super

2483.68 --> 2486.64
far site

2484.48 --> 2488.4
at very low observation height it's just

2486.64 --> 2491.92
over that's the black swan

2488.4 --> 2495.44
if that's seen just once then it's

2491.92 --> 2496.2400000000002
it's done it can't be anything other

2495.44 --> 2498.079
than flat

2496.24 --> 2499.52
because on the globe that could never be

2498.079 --> 2501.76
seen

2499.52 --> 2503.92
and terrestrial refraction is a science

2501.76 --> 2507.5200000000004
fiction concept it's not grounded in

2503.92 --> 2510.8
actual optics mechanics at all

2507.52 --> 2514.56
it's actually quite contra opposite

2510.8 --> 2516.88
to a lot of the effects that are

2514.56 --> 2519.44
established in optics it works the

2516.88 --> 2521.52
opposite it makes no sense

2519.44 --> 2523.28
you're not being honest with myself oh

2521.52 --> 2525.119
really you're gonna try to gaslight me

2523.28 --> 2528.2400000000002
now

2525.119 --> 2528.2400000000002
that's really pathetic

2531.76 --> 2539.119
no it's flat

2535.28 --> 2541.76
it's really really flat right

2539.119 --> 2542.6400000000003
remember the episode two days ago was it

2541.76 --> 2545.119
three days ago

2542.64 --> 2547.52
at the title you know there's

2545.119 --> 2549.359
terrestrial refraction going on because

2547.52 --> 2553.68
it looks so flat

2549.359 --> 2556.4
yeah that's my joke it's my

2553.68 --> 2556.3999999999996
flat earthing

2556.72 --> 2565.839
yeah flat earth transformation of the

2560.48 --> 2565.839
infamous remark

2566.0 --> 2568.8
you know the guy

2569.92 --> 2572.96
i did why am i forgetting him that's

2572.4 --> 2578.079
weird

2572.96 --> 2582.48
uh spacex and [ __ ]

2578.079 --> 2582.48
i why i don't know

2584.079 --> 2586.4
dude

2587.76 --> 2590.96
elon musk right

2591.04 --> 2594.8
you know it's real because it looks so

2592.56 --> 2596.88
fake well that's ridiculous

2594.8 --> 2600.0
that's really ridiculous to say well i

2596.88 --> 2603.04
ex yes thank you tiny wumbo

2600.0 --> 2605.359
i expanded on it saying

2603.04 --> 2606.079
you know there's terrestrial refraction

2605.359 --> 2608.96
happening

2606.079 --> 2610.079
because it looks so flat it's on the

2608.96 --> 2612.48
same level

2610.079 --> 2613.44
it's literally the same formula adapted

2612.48 --> 2617.04
to

2613.44 --> 2619.839
something very similar in your face

2617.04 --> 2621.7599999999998
right terrestrial refraction is science

2619.839 --> 2624.7999999999997
fiction

2621.76 --> 2627.44
it's so much science fiction as in

2624.8 --> 2629.28
purely a conceptual idea it's so much

2627.44 --> 2632.4
science fiction

2629.28 --> 2635.76
that it's ever not actually never been

2632.4 --> 2638.8
emulated even though ray tracing

2635.76 --> 2642.0
technology computer technology

2638.8 --> 2643.2000000000003
has been around for what is it now three

2642.0 --> 2645.92
decades

2643.2 --> 2646.48
more if you take like the the secret

2645.92 --> 2648.2400000000002
stuff

2646.48 --> 2649.76
from the cia and all that they probably

2648.24 --> 2651.4399999999996
worked on it a lot longer nasa's

2649.76 --> 2655.599
probably worked on it for

2651.44 --> 2658.48
half a century in secret

2655.599 --> 2660.6400000000003
or something like that right well it's

2658.48 --> 2662.64
been out so long i've even tested it

2660.64 --> 2665.7599999999998
myself in in the 90s

2662.64 --> 2669.44
on my amiga 1200

2665.76 --> 2672.6400000000003
and yeah all optical effects

2669.44 --> 2674.88
have been figured out and

2672.64 --> 2678.48
can literally be applied in ray tracing

2674.88 --> 2678.48
it's pretty remarkable

2678.72 --> 2683.5989999999997
how how amazingly accurate ray tracing

2682.319 --> 2686.16
really is

2683.599 --> 2688.7200000000003
right and that's also a bit of point of

2686.16 --> 2692.0
annoyance when

2688.72 --> 2694.7999999999997
rhombus brings up oh just a ray

2692.0 --> 2695.44
and then qe says no lighter not a race

2694.8 --> 2697.44
blah blah

2695.44 --> 2698.48
yeah that's really cute but yeah the

2697.44 --> 2701.52
emulations

2698.48 --> 2705.28
are so unbelievably accurate that it can

2701.52 --> 2708.64
literally fool people right

2705.28 --> 2711.76
it's that accurate if it can actually

2708.64 --> 2712.7999999999997
make you believe something is real then

2711.76 --> 2715.44
there's

2712.8 --> 2717.2000000000003
something happening that's really an

2715.44 --> 2720.56
effective emulation in a way

2717.2 --> 2722.8799999999997
so is it really not a ray i don't know

2720.56 --> 2723.68
in my conception light is infinitely

2722.88 --> 2726.56
divisible

2723.68 --> 2727.2
beams kind of sounds a bit like a ray

2726.56 --> 2730.16
doesn't it

2727.2 --> 2732.3999999999996
right a ray is a just a one or two

2730.16 --> 2734.56
dimensional thing

2732.4 --> 2736.88
but yeah if it's an infinitely divisible

2734.56 --> 2736.88
beam

2737.52 --> 2745.44
that could also be reduced to array

2741.68 --> 2748.7999999999997
and guess what ray tracing is the thing

2745.44 --> 2752.319
to emulate sight so

2748.8 --> 2753.04
there you go right now i've lost my

2752.319 --> 2756.56
point

2753.04 --> 2758.319
uh yeah in in ray tracing

2756.56 --> 2760.56
there's never been a successful

2758.319 --> 2762.72
terrestrial refraction simulation

2760.56 --> 2764.48
ever right there's been simulations like

2762.72 --> 2768.64
okay let's make a globe

2764.48 --> 2771.119
for like some game thing

2768.64 --> 2772.4
pure computer game even from in the wire

2771.119 --> 2774.079
frame age right

2772.4 --> 2776.96
yeah they could make a globe well guess

2774.079 --> 2779.28
what almost all games that did that

2776.96 --> 2780.8
stopped doing that because it made

2779.28 --> 2783.52
people sick

2780.8 --> 2785.8390000000004
because of well the way it looks it's

2783.52 --> 2786.88
unnatural everything is unnatural on the

2785.839 --> 2790.48
globe

2786.88 --> 2792.56
right and on the globe without

2790.48 --> 2794.2400000000002
the science fiction concept of

2792.56 --> 2798.4
terrestrial refraction

2794.24 --> 2802.3999999999996
because they can't get it in

2798.4 --> 2803.04
right it's much easier to take a flat

2802.4 --> 2806.2400000000002
plane

2803.04 --> 2809.359
turn it into a globe that's a pretty

2806.24 --> 2811.2799999999997
relatively easy process but the other

2809.359 --> 2814.72
way around

2811.28 --> 2818.1600000000003
that's impossible it's

2814.72 --> 2819.2799999999997
it's undoable and that's why it's never

2818.16 --> 2822.64
been

2819.28 --> 2826.8
there's no standard mechanism in

2822.64 --> 2830.4
ray tracing of terrestrial refraction

2826.8 --> 2833.8390000000004
you can calculate it but you can't

2830.4 --> 2836.8
actually apply it to the ray tracing

2833.839 --> 2838.7999999999997
you know why that is because rays don't

2836.8 --> 2841.8390000000004
bend

2838.8 --> 2842.559
in ray tracing the only way there is

2841.839 --> 2844.7999999999997
like

2842.559 --> 2846.079
optical deviation is through a

2844.8 --> 2848.88
transition

2846.079 --> 2850.2400000000002
of the medium it it's it meets if that

2848.88 --> 2853.44
ray meets the face

2850.24 --> 2856.24
the face has a refraction index

2853.44 --> 2857.359
scale which kind of implies the material

2856.24 --> 2860.72
that it's going to

2857.359 --> 2863.359
get into and out of again

2860.72 --> 2866.0789999999997
that's how it's emulated so there is

2863.359 --> 2867.7599999999998
refraction happening a deviation of the

2866.079 --> 2871.44
beam

2867.76 --> 2875.2000000000003
but in an open non-face

2871.44 --> 2878.2400000000002
system there is no curved

2875.2 --> 2881.4399999999996
ray they can't do it it's

2878.24 --> 2883.2799999999997
impossible to emulate it it's never been

2881.44 --> 2886.0
done because it's impossible

2883.28 --> 2887.44
you can't apply terrestrial refraction

2886.0 --> 2890.64
in ray tracing

2887.44 --> 2893.28
you can calculate it afterward

2890.64 --> 2894.72
you can't actually adapt it because

2893.28 --> 2897.52
everything becomes com

2894.72 --> 2898.72
it always breaks it always breaks it

2897.52 --> 2901.839
never

2898.72 --> 2905.1189999999997
actually results in similar extreme far

2901.839 --> 2908.16
sights as we see on earth because it's

2905.119 --> 2910.079
impossible to get the formula complete

2908.16 --> 2912.319
it's like an infinite formula it's a

2910.079 --> 2914.079
spiraling formula the farther away you

2912.319 --> 2916.88
see the more impossible it is to

2914.079 --> 2919.04
actually have that naturally manifest in

2916.88 --> 2921.52
a stable way

2919.04 --> 2923.599
it's impossible to apply terrestrial

2921.52 --> 2926.72
refraction to ray tracing

2923.599 --> 2929.04
right if it were it would still just be

2926.72 --> 2931.68
incredible hassle it would be

2929.04 --> 2933.2
like okay you take a globe design

2931.68 --> 2935.04
geometric

2933.2 --> 2937.2799999999997
then you're going to apply terrestrial

2935.04 --> 2937.68
refraction to it to kind of make it look

2937.28 --> 2939.8390000000004
like

2937.68 --> 2940.96
it does on a presupposed ball earth

2939.839 --> 2943.7599999999998
we're supposed to be

2940.96 --> 2944.8
walking on and it looks flat right well

2943.76 --> 2949.0400000000004
guess what they do

2944.8 --> 2952.2400000000002
instead in ray tracing in in video land

2949.04 --> 2954.64
cgi land in computer games right

2952.24 --> 2955.7599999999998
what they do is they just take a flat

2954.64 --> 2958.319
plane and hey

2955.76 --> 2959.2000000000003
if there's some importance to the

2958.319 --> 2962.24
emphasis of

2959.2 --> 2964.16
globe or whatever they just do a zoom

2962.24 --> 2965.52
out effect and turn it into a globe just

2964.16 --> 2967.68
like with google

2965.52 --> 2968.64
or they just add a globe somewhere else

2967.68 --> 2971.7599999999998
or they just

2968.64 --> 2973.52
say it's a globe and because everything

2971.76 --> 2975.599
looks flat like normal

2973.52 --> 2977.359
just like in the real world you'll buy

2975.599 --> 2978.1600000000003
it because in the real world you're made

2977.359 --> 2980.16
to buy

2978.16 --> 2982.24
it that it looks so flat because it's a

2980.16 --> 2985.52
globe

2982.24 --> 2988.24
right so they've never really needed

2985.52 --> 2989.68
to create terrestrial refraction which

2988.24 --> 2993.2799999999997
is never going to work anyway

2989.68 --> 2996.319
it's too convoluted it's too unstable

2993.28 --> 2996.88
right can never move outside of the

2996.319 --> 3000.48
realm

2996.88 --> 3002.6400000000003
of conception science fiction

3000.48 --> 3005.119
terrestrial refraction is science

3002.64 --> 3005.1189999999997
fiction

3010.319 --> 3015.2
yeah do you see now i have actual

3013.52 --> 3018.64
practical experience from

3015.2 --> 3021.2799999999997
over 20 years ago working with this

3018.64 --> 3023.5989999999997
understanding little but still picking

3021.28 --> 3027.52
up on the observations and tests

3023.599 --> 3029.599
i did the experiments or tests

3027.52 --> 3031.04
experimentation with optics in ray

3029.599 --> 3033.52
tracing before

3031.04 --> 3036.16
i understood pretty much anything i just

3033.52 --> 3038.8
learned about the basics and now

3036.16 --> 3040.48
going through the material seeing the

3038.8 --> 3043.8390000000004
presentations on refraction

3040.48 --> 3046.8
actual refractions it's like holy [ __ ]

3043.839 --> 3047.68
that's what i was doing that was it now

3046.8 --> 3050.7200000000003
i get it

3047.68 --> 3052.16
and i have a feedback with with my own

3050.72 --> 3055.2799999999997
experience in the past it's

3052.16 --> 3057.5989999999997
it's really astounding

3055.28 --> 3059.8390000000004
and it makes me very happy that i did do

3057.599 --> 3059.839
that

3060.24 --> 3064.72
it's a sphere yeah keep chanting aaron

3062.4 --> 3070.0
armstrong keep chanting

3064.72 --> 3070.0
chant for me chant for me aaron it's a

3072.54 --> 3079.719
[Music]

3080.839 --> 3083.839
sphere

3085.359 --> 3089.2
when you are close to an object anything

3087.92 --> 3093.359
looks flat

3089.2 --> 3094.0
yeah and when you look very very far

3093.359 --> 3097.119
away

3094.0 --> 3099.839
at a very low observation height then

3097.119 --> 3101.119
sometimes it also looks flat guess what

3099.839 --> 3102.88
that sometimes

3101.119 --> 3104.1600000000003
is called the black swan and it means

3102.88 --> 3106.8
that it is flat

3104.16 --> 3107.839
because that's impossible on a geometric

3106.8 --> 3111.8390000000004
sphere

3107.839 --> 3111.839
it can't happen

3113.2 --> 3116.7999999999997
and if you're gonna resort back to

3114.96 --> 3119.04
terrestrial refraction

3116.8 --> 3120.48
let me remind you again it's a science

3119.04 --> 3122.5589999999997
fiction concept

3120.48 --> 3125.2
it's never actually been demonstrated

3122.559 --> 3128.88
you can't even apply it to ray tracing

3125.2 --> 3129.5989999999997
it's not done they don't do it nobody

3128.88 --> 3133.44
does it

3129.599 --> 3136.7200000000003
in game land right in 3d

3133.44 --> 3138.88
simulation make believe like it is real

3136.72 --> 3140.16
they never use it they just use flat

3138.88 --> 3143.2000000000003
planes

3140.16 --> 3145.2
every time even in big games

3143.2 --> 3146.64
with a lot of landscape yeah they use

3145.2 --> 3148.64
flat

3146.64 --> 3153.839
because that's the only way it can be

3148.64 --> 3153.839
made to look real

3157.53 --> 3161.7290000000003
[Music]

3166.78 --> 3169.909
[Music]

3178.839 --> 3181.839
hmm

3188.8 --> 3192.7200000000003
this nasa makes expensive and bad

3191.2 --> 3195.52
drawings though

3192.72 --> 3197.52
oh what do you mean just the the sphere

3195.52 --> 3200.88
the planet paintings well right but

3197.52 --> 3200.88
that's a different thing right

3202.8 --> 3206.079
planet paintings

3206.16 --> 3212.0
versus the actual ground-based

3209.2 --> 3215.52
observations it's very different

3212.0 --> 3218.24
right because we can't just regularly

3215.52 --> 3219.119
go up there and just see like oh yeah

3218.24 --> 3222.8799999999997
there's the sphere

3219.119 --> 3225.599
right no no we can never do that but

3222.88 --> 3227.6800000000003
we can constantly go outside and just

3225.599 --> 3229.44
have a look and see what it looks like

3227.68 --> 3232.8799999999997
or go to another place and see what it

3229.44 --> 3235.28
looks like there in different times

3232.88 --> 3237.2000000000003
different types of weather we can do

3235.28 --> 3238.3190000000004
that so if they're going to emulate

3237.2 --> 3240.72
anything

3238.319 --> 3242.079
ground-based yeah they're going to have

3240.72 --> 3245.04
to use it

3242.079 --> 3245.599
a is a standardized system that makes it

3245.04 --> 3247.7599999999998
looks

3245.599 --> 3249.2000000000003
look real guess which system that is

3247.76 --> 3255.119
flat

3249.2 --> 3255.1189999999997
they use flat because then it looks real

3259.68 --> 3263.359
so it's just compartmentalized the

3262.079 --> 3265.2000000000003
planet view

3263.359 --> 3279.7599999999998
and there's actual ground-based

3265.2 --> 3293.839
realistic view

3279.76 --> 3293.8390000000004
yeah hello clutch bear good to see you

3308.0 --> 3313.319
yeah mother eyes isn't that just cute

3311.52 --> 3316.319
it's the multi-compartment

3313.319 --> 3316.319
misunderstanding

3316.48 --> 3326.2400000000002
right from from newbie

3320.4 --> 3326.2400000000002
to trencher it's all over the place

3326.88 --> 3330.7200000000003
like the trenchers basically say no it

3329.04 --> 3332.64
looks flat because there's terrestrial

3330.72 --> 3336.24
fraction going on and the newbie says

3332.64 --> 3340.16
yeah but no there it's it's physically

3336.24 --> 3340.16
obstructed because things go over it

3340.72 --> 3345.1189999999997
and even trencher ballers don't correct

3343.92 --> 3347.44
that they leave

3345.119 --> 3348.48
the newbies to believe that they'll even

3347.44 --> 3351.92
play into

3348.48 --> 3355.76
that level of story until

3351.92 --> 3358.559
they figure out way nobody ever claimed

3355.76 --> 3361.0400000000004
the geometric horizon was earth curve

3358.559 --> 3361.76
through confrontation with flat earthers

3361.04 --> 3364.4
and then

3361.76 --> 3366.2400000000002
the trenchers bring on the next level

3364.4 --> 3370.079
explanation which is terrestrial

3366.24 --> 3370.0789999999997
refraction and makes it look so flat

3371.52 --> 3377.839
it's funny isn't it how that works

3388.799 --> 3392.88
yeah that's good global when gravity is

3391.359 --> 3395.92
right well they're still

3392.88 --> 3396.96
in the works you know gravity the thing

3395.92 --> 3398.96
we all accept

3396.96 --> 3400.319
supposedly exists and are taught in

3398.96 --> 3402.88
school exists

3400.319 --> 3404.16
they're still in the works of actually

3402.88 --> 3407.44
trying to figure out

3404.16 --> 3409.7599999999998
what it is even though it's already

3407.44 --> 3412.16
being claimed as a key staple

3409.76 --> 3413.28
thing in knowledge right in their

3412.16 --> 3416.0789999999997
knowledge

3413.28 --> 3417.92
it's already existing but we're still in

3416.079 --> 3418.96
the middle of trying to figure out what

3417.92 --> 3422.0
it is

3418.96 --> 3425.119
isn't that just special

3422.0 --> 3429.44
right so it's a science fiction concept

3425.119 --> 3433.28
that is just forced in assumed

3429.44 --> 3435.52
it's just made to be assumed but

3433.28 --> 3436.6400000000003
officially they're still trying to

3435.52 --> 3439.92
figure out what it

3436.64 --> 3443.1189999999997
really even is it's

3439.92 --> 3446.48
pretty nutty also

3443.119 --> 3448.0
like yeah there may be people up there

3446.48 --> 3450.48
in the physics and all that they'll say

3448.0 --> 3451.04
no no it's no it is they'll establish

3450.48 --> 3453.04
what's

3451.04 --> 3455.04
what this is well guess what put them

3453.04 --> 3456.0
next to like a hundred other of those

3455.04 --> 3458.48
researched

3456.0 --> 3459.119
people and they will all just start

3458.48 --> 3462.4
bickering

3459.119 --> 3464.1600000000003
like no this is no it's not this that's

3462.4 --> 3467.2000000000003
because

3464.16 --> 3468.319
people may think and believe it's just

3467.2 --> 3472.64
settled

3468.319 --> 3475.839
but effectively it isn't

3472.64 --> 3475.839
it just isn't

3476.72 --> 3484.16
so yeah whatever at any time any person

3480.4 --> 3486.88
holds on to gravity to be absolutely

3484.16 --> 3486.8799999999997
worked out

3487.839 --> 3494.2799999999997
it's going to be based on their personal

3491.28 --> 3495.44
belief about it and me yeah

3494.28 --> 3499.119
misunderstanding

3495.44 --> 3499.76
of what is actually going down in the

3499.119 --> 3503.839
world

3499.76 --> 3503.8390000000004
haha pun intended

3504.799 --> 3509.44
going down in the debating community in

3507.52 --> 3512.64
the physics community

3509.44 --> 3514.0
and what is actually considered real and

3512.64 --> 3516.48
not

3514.0 --> 3518.64
like there's games being played with

3516.48 --> 3518.64
that

3522.079 --> 3526.96
and yeah if you're not ready to deal

3525.68 --> 3528.8799999999997
with that

3526.96 --> 3530.2400000000002
then yeah a lot of people are just gonna

3528.88 --> 3533.2000000000003
end up

3530.24 --> 3534.16
falling into some kind of personal

3533.2 --> 3536.64
belief about it

3534.16 --> 3539.5989999999997
and then just kind of assuming that that

3536.64 --> 3539.5989999999997
is what it has to be

3540.64 --> 3544.48
and they keep that becomes a private

3543.359 --> 3559.839
belief and

3544.48 --> 3559.839
yeah that's it

3562.4 --> 3568.1600000000003
oh guesses see well seeking stuff no

3565.04 --> 3568.16
it's not even a guess

3568.319 --> 3572.319
it wasn't a guess it was just a straight

3570.4 --> 3574.2400000000002
out assumption

3572.319 --> 3576.16
straight out assumption that venus is

3574.24 --> 3576.9599999999996
the same size as earth straight out

3576.16 --> 3579.5989999999997
assumption

3576.96 --> 3580.319
not a guess they didn't measure anything

3579.599 --> 3587.839
they just

3580.319 --> 3587.839
said no it's the same size

3612.839 --> 3615.839
hmm

3624.24 --> 3629.839
right hey samson

3631.839 --> 3643.359
right seems iron armstrong has moved

3635.04 --> 3645.839
moved on

3643.359 --> 3646.88
oh really oh look dave johnson's still

3645.839 --> 3649.92
here though

3646.88 --> 3651.76
people thousands of years ago didn't

3649.92 --> 3654.48
know the shape of the earth

3651.76 --> 3656.7990000000004
until they did experiments oh really

3654.48 --> 3660.48
what was their independent variable

3656.799 --> 3665.44
calculations sure and observations

3660.48 --> 3665.44
right no presuppositions i beg to differ

3667.68 --> 3671.5989999999997
like which observations exactly did they

3670.16 --> 3673.44
do

3671.599 --> 3675.119
no presuppositions i think there were

3673.44 --> 3677.04
presuppositions they started to

3675.119 --> 3679.52
presuppose for starters

3677.04 --> 3682.4
that the light from the heavenly bodies

3679.52 --> 3685.44
including the sun

3682.4 --> 3688.0
was a sign that the earth was

3685.44 --> 3689.76
a sphere underneath it and that's why

3688.0 --> 3691.92
the angles of the sun

3689.76 --> 3693.76
changed over the time and that

3691.92 --> 3695.839
correlated with the distance

3693.76 --> 3698.0
further away and all that yeah they

3695.839 --> 3699.839
absolutely assumed the earth was a

3698.0 --> 3703.359
sphere

3699.839 --> 3707.2
based on that right

3703.359 --> 3710.839
and then was that aristotle's

3707.2 --> 3714.5589999999997
and then later it's his name again

3710.839 --> 3718.64
albiruni actually

3714.559 --> 3721.6800000000003
tried to measure optically the horizon

3718.64 --> 3722.4
to figure out what the what the size of

3721.68 --> 3725.7599999999998
the sphere

3722.4 --> 3726.0
actually is and guess what it turned out

3725.76 --> 3729.599
he

3726.0 --> 3731.839
was several degrees off so

3729.599 --> 3732.799
yeah that didn't really work out either

3731.839 --> 3737.0389999999998
right so yeah he

3732.799 --> 3740.559
attempted something it didn't work

3737.039 --> 3742.7990000000004
yet it's still just like oh he was off

3740.559 --> 3744.0
somewhat that's all oh really so he was

3742.799 --> 3747.359
off and that's okay

3744.0 --> 3749.92
he was off by by percentages

3747.359 --> 3750.48
so what right yeah it was just off what

3749.92 --> 3752.16
what

3750.48 --> 3754.2400000000002
just only the guy that actually

3752.16 --> 3754.96
optically measured the radius supposedly

3754.24 --> 3756.799
right

3754.96 --> 3759.28
it was just off what's it that's what's

3756.799 --> 3762.079
the problem

3759.28 --> 3764.48
well the problem is is that the

3762.079 --> 3768.319
experiment as you call it

3764.48 --> 3771.44
the test didn't yield the radius

3768.319 --> 3771.92
that is currently assumed that's the

3771.44 --> 3775.599
problem

3771.92 --> 3778.799
and guess what nobody else has

3775.599 --> 3778.799
nobody's done that

3779.039 --> 3785.599
right because it's always off it's

3781.839 --> 3785.599
always off it's never a sphere

3788.41 --> 3791.54
[Music]

3794.839 --> 3797.96
never

3796.0 --> 3800.24
but do you agree that he was no he was

3797.96 --> 3803.28
presupposing the globe don't be so

3800.24 --> 3807.52
desperate dave johnson

3803.28 --> 3811.8390000000004
a few degrees off oh that's all right

3807.52 --> 3811.839
yeah that matters a lot

3819.359 --> 3822.4
calculating the ground now he was

3820.799 --> 3825.7599999999998
presupposing the globe

3822.4 --> 3826.319
he was figuring out if the earth is a

3825.76 --> 3829.119
globe

3826.319 --> 3829.52
then what is the radius of the globe

3829.119 --> 3831.2000000000003
okay

3829.52 --> 3833.359
let's look at the horizon if the earth

3831.2 --> 3835.1189999999997
was a globe then that horizon

3833.359 --> 3837.68
i'm going to assume is the edge of a

3835.119 --> 3838.079
sphere the sphere that i'm assume i'm

3837.68 --> 3842.16
standing

3838.079 --> 3846.6400000000003
on so let's see yeah

3842.16 --> 3846.64
what the size of that sphere is then

3847.599 --> 3854.7200000000003
oh it's completely off oh

3851.039 --> 3858.559
oh right well he at least he tried

3854.72 --> 3861.7599999999998
right yeah but it was off

3858.559 --> 3864.079
a lot just a few degrees is a lot it's

3861.76 --> 3867.3590000000004
not like oh

3864.079 --> 3870.6400000000003
0.1 offer no he was

3867.359 --> 3873.119
several percent off that's off

3870.64 --> 3873.1189999999997
a lot

3878.839 --> 3881.839
right

3895.359 --> 3900.72
calculate observe believe that yeah

3898.0 --> 3902.799
there's a black swan observation

3900.72 --> 3904.9599999999996
there's there's black swan observations

3902.799 --> 3908.16
right

3904.96 --> 3912.16
very low observation height very distant

3908.16 --> 3913.839
sites yeah that that's really only

3912.16 --> 3916.8799999999997
possible

3913.839 --> 3918.799
on a flat plain where the geometric

3916.88 --> 3923.28
orientation of the earth's surface

3918.799 --> 3927.7599999999998
is flat

3923.28 --> 3927.76
i'm so dishonest wow

3929.119 --> 3933.6800000000003
well since you're gonna piss off i'm

3932.079 --> 3936.6400000000003
just gonna leave it to that but

3933.68 --> 3938.8799999999997
yeah if you come in with that sort of

3936.64 --> 3941.0389999999998
[ __ ] here again i will eventually ban

3938.88 --> 3944.1600000000003
you because it's just really pathetic

3941.039 --> 3946.7990000000004
right dishonest about what you can't be

3944.16 --> 3950.24
specific about anything it's all just

3946.799 --> 3965.839
blank assertions at homes

3950.24 --> 3965.839
it's really pathetic

3966.319 --> 3972.419
calculations are now more precise

3969.26 --> 3972.4190000000003
[Music]

3974.4 --> 3980.4
instruments are not as good as no

3978.079 --> 3982.48
what does the instrument have to do with

3980.4 --> 3986.48
it

3982.48 --> 3988.88
no no it's not that

3986.48 --> 3990.0
alberoni's instruments were not good

3988.88 --> 3992.48
enough

3990.0 --> 3994.48
it's just that the horizon is not the

3992.48 --> 3996.799
edge of his sphere

3994.48 --> 3997.68
of the sphere that is presumed the earth

3996.799 --> 3999.839
to be

3997.68 --> 4002.0789999999997
that size right it's not it's not that

3999.839 --> 4005.92
sphere that's not because of

4002.079 --> 4007.92
the equipment was too old or whatever

4005.92 --> 4011.039
right that has nothing to do with that

4007.92 --> 4012.319
it's just not that sphere the earth is

4011.039 --> 4014.96
not that sphere

4012.319 --> 4016.64
right doesn't matter if you use like a

4014.96 --> 4019.599
hubble telescope size

4016.64 --> 4020.0
telescope to look at the horizon oh why

4019.599 --> 4023.76
is nobody

4020.0 --> 4023.76
ever done that what do you think right

4024.079 --> 4028.88
it doesn't matter what kind of telescope

4027.2 --> 4032.0789999999997
if you're going to use a looking glass

4028.88 --> 4035.28
it doesn't matter the point is

4032.079 --> 4036.559
it doesn't match the geometric horizon

4035.28 --> 4040.0
that is required

4036.559 --> 4042.2400000000002
for the currently believed size sphere

4040.0 --> 4044.24
earth that's the problem it doesn't

4042.24 --> 4047.359
matter what kind of equipment you have

4044.24 --> 4048.319
in order to observe the horizon it

4047.359 --> 4050.96
doesn't match

4048.319 --> 4050.96
the sphere

4058.559 --> 4064.2400000000002
i have to deny gravity you don't even

4061.44 --> 4067.839
know what gravity is dave johnson

4064.24 --> 4071.9199999999996
literally i i talked about this nobody

4067.839 --> 4075.359
knows what gravity actually is

4071.92 --> 4078.319
nobody has actually even

4075.359 --> 4079.52
figured out what what is the real proof

4078.319 --> 4082.079
for gravity

4079.52 --> 4083.7599999999998
right well in order to find the proof

4082.079 --> 4084.559
for gravity first you have to know what

4083.76 --> 4088.2400000000002
it is

4084.559 --> 4091.8390000000004
guess what people can't agree on what

4088.24 --> 4091.839
gravity is

4096.799 --> 4100.239
right in the meantime there's relative

4099.52 --> 4102.4800000000005
density

4100.239 --> 4104.0
which is already been established even

4102.48 --> 4107.3589999999995
in physics and that works just

4104.0 --> 4112.08
great it works very persistently it's a

4107.359 --> 4114.08
adaptable to very complex setups

4112.08 --> 4115.359
which are not even that difficult to

4114.08 --> 4118.88
create yourself

4115.359 --> 4120.799
just anything anything works with

4118.88 --> 4121.6
relative density you don't have to get

4120.799 --> 4124.239
weird

4121.6 --> 4124.2390000000005
to prove it

4126.319 --> 4130.96
oh not all the world is going to agree

4128.64 --> 4133.759
with my teachings oh

4130.96 --> 4135.759
i'm so disappointed it's not like i

4133.759 --> 4139.52
never thought that was gonna happen

4135.759 --> 4139.52
right yeah duh

4142.48 --> 4148.159
you think i care about that i just cared

4145.759 --> 4151.759
to be accurate

4148.159 --> 4155.2789999999995
i've already relinquished already

4151.759 --> 4158.719
settled very very long ago

4155.279 --> 4159.359
that the world the vast majority of the

4158.719 --> 4162.719
world

4159.359 --> 4166.159000000001
will always stick to

4162.719 --> 4169.279
lies to comfort them

4166.159 --> 4175.2789999999995
in anything anything

4169.279 --> 4178.319
the devil is very influential like that

4175.279 --> 4180.319
right and not even just talking about

4178.319 --> 4180.719
flat earth versus globe or anything it's

4180.319 --> 4184.0
just

4180.719 --> 4186.08
anything right so oh no

4184.0 --> 4188.96
the world doesn't agree with me the vast

4186.08 --> 4192.5599999999995
majority of who gives a [ __ ]

4188.96 --> 4192.88
look at what they're doing do i really

4192.56 --> 4195.360000000001
need

4192.88 --> 4198.4800000000005
those people that are just totally

4195.36 --> 4198.48
messed up out there

4198.64 --> 4206.08
do i need their agreement

4202.08 --> 4207.12
no way why would i need the agreement of

4206.08 --> 4210.8
some

4207.12 --> 4214.8
of the giant hoarder lunatics

4210.8 --> 4217.12
with actual registered lunatic behavior

4214.8 --> 4218.320000000001
i don't really care about that i just

4217.12 --> 4220.96
care to be correct

4218.32 --> 4222.799999999999
and then i hope other people will pick

4220.96 --> 4225.12
up on that

4222.8 --> 4231.84
and then do the same that's all i can

4225.12 --> 4231.84
hope for

4242.84 --> 4247.12
uh

4244.159 --> 4249.28
right and i still hope that i'll be

4247.12 --> 4250.96
corrected when i actually make a mistake

4249.28 --> 4254.0
because i'm not mistake proof

4250.96 --> 4256.0
right one thing you can trust up

4254.0 --> 4257.76
is that i'm always going to try to do

4256.0 --> 4259.92
the right thing

4257.76 --> 4261.04
and try to correct myself when i figure

4259.92 --> 4263.2390000000005
out i made a mistake

4261.04 --> 4265.36
right but just say oh you're

4263.239 --> 4267.36
disingenuous or you're a liar

4265.36 --> 4268.4
you're completely wrong without any

4267.36 --> 4272.719
actual

4268.4 --> 4274.639999999999
correction information that's just

4272.719 --> 4276.64
a sign that you don't really have

4274.64 --> 4279.52
anything to correct

4276.64 --> 4281.4400000000005
it's just that you object and you can't

4279.52 --> 4283.84
do anything

4281.44 --> 4285.678999999999
with it because you object for personal

4283.84 --> 4289.52
reasons not for

4285.679 --> 4290.88
intellectual reasons for factual reasons

4289.52 --> 4293.120000000001
right

4290.88 --> 4295.36
but hey if i'm wrong about something and

4293.12 --> 4298.48
somebody corrects me

4295.36 --> 4301.679
like literally i'll be thankful

4298.48 --> 4304.4
i'm glad that i still

4301.679 --> 4305.84
have the capability of people correcting

4304.4 --> 4308.5599999999995
me

4305.84 --> 4310.2390000000005
that's a luxury that people feel like

4308.56 --> 4313.360000000001
they could correct me

4310.239 --> 4316.48
i'd be very unhappy if people

4313.36 --> 4318.96
around me would be afraid to correct me

4316.48 --> 4322.32
when they know i'm wrong

4318.96 --> 4322.32
and that i'm not seeing it

4324.08 --> 4328.0
right but they would have to actually

4326.719 --> 4331.84
correct me

4328.0 --> 4335.12
and not just gaslight me or ad-hoc me

4331.84 --> 4337.84
that's the difference in content

4335.12 --> 4339.199
correction not just oh you are bad or i

4337.84 --> 4343.84
don't like it

4339.199 --> 4343.839999999999
or whatever

4352.239 --> 4356.799999999999
there is masses of info days i found it

4355.04 --> 4359.199
10 years ago what

4356.8 --> 4359.1990000000005
smith

4362.719 --> 4368.0
yeah dude rasta hat dude

4365.84 --> 4370.159000000001
it's only a matter of time before they

4368.0 --> 4372.0
dig up some ancient

4370.159 --> 4374.799999999999
temple that's never been discovered

4372.0 --> 4379.199
before and they find

4374.8 --> 4382.8
them the mechanize and the scrolls

4379.199 --> 4384.0
that prove gravity is they'll find the

4382.8 --> 4386.400000000001
ancient knowledge of

4384.0 --> 4388.96
gravity and finally establish what it

4386.4 --> 4388.96
really is

4389.12 --> 4394.96
because they don't have it now right

4392.96 --> 4399.84
but they find the ancient scrolls of

4394.96 --> 4399.84
gravity one day

4410.96 --> 4415.199
all right well yeah martha's gravity

4413.52 --> 4419.52
originally was conjured

4415.199 --> 4422.08
to basically bend the uniform directions

4419.52 --> 4425.52
of relative density

4422.08 --> 4428.719
uniform into a

4425.52 --> 4431.360000000001
360 angular based system

4428.719 --> 4433.52
virtually like conceptually that's what

4431.36 --> 4435.599999999999
it was conjured for and then

4433.52 --> 4437.280000000001
came all the other complications of

4435.6 --> 4440.400000000001
infinite vacuum and

4437.28 --> 4443.84
they've really never really fixed it

4440.4 --> 4446.08
it's almost like they wanted it broken

4443.84 --> 4447.04
because even the force of gravity when

4446.08 --> 4448.8
it was still

4447.04 --> 4450.32
assumed to be a force is not strong

4448.8 --> 4452.56
enough to

4450.32 --> 4454.96
withstand gas pressure expanding in all

4452.56 --> 4457.6
directions in an infinite volume

4454.96 --> 4460.08
right that's just official it's official

4457.6 --> 4463.4400000000005
it's official

4460.08 --> 4464.48
gravity assumed as a force is not strong

4463.44 --> 4468.159
enough

4464.48 --> 4470.32
pushing back against a gas expanding in

4468.159 --> 4472.48
all directions in an infinite sized

4470.32 --> 4474.88
vacuum

4472.48 --> 4477.199
and the strength of its expansion is

4474.88 --> 4480.84
proportional to the volume

4477.199 --> 4484.5599999999995
it's it's physically mathematically

4480.84 --> 4486.96
impossible right and that's

4484.56 --> 4489.280000000001
already presupposing aspects of the

4486.96 --> 4490.64
heliocentric cosmology it's already

4489.28 --> 4494.159
assuming

4490.64 --> 4496.8
that they're right or something

4494.159 --> 4498.159
and even then it doesn't work and this

4496.8 --> 4501.360000000001
kind of problematic

4498.159 --> 4505.04
situation happens all over the model

4501.36 --> 4507.92
all over it it really is the most broken

4505.04 --> 4510.64
model ever devised and it's kind of

4507.92 --> 4513.36
miraculous that

4510.64 --> 4515.84
that they keep it that way because

4513.36 --> 4517.04
aspects about it could be fixed but it

4515.84 --> 4520.64
seems like it's

4517.04 --> 4523.36
been made to be broken it's

4520.64 --> 4523.360000000001
it's like a

4523.76 --> 4530.8
a test it's a it's a test of

4526.8 --> 4533.1990000000005
critical thinking will you be able to

4530.8 --> 4536.08
abandon your love for the fantasy and

4533.199 --> 4536.08
the cgi

4536.84 --> 4541.92
for the reason

4539.52 --> 4543.76
the mistakes you will figure out when

4541.92 --> 4544.56
you really look into the details will

4543.76 --> 4547.360000000001
you pick up

4544.56 --> 4549.280000000001
that it's impossible that the ball is

4547.36 --> 4550.88
impossible will you pick up on that

4549.28 --> 4552.719
are you smart enough do you have

4550.88 --> 4553.4400000000005
critical thinking do you have proper

4552.719 --> 4556.4800000000005
background

4553.44 --> 4559.599999999999
teaching dealing with critical thinking

4556.48 --> 4560.48
in order to figure that out it's like it

4559.6 --> 4567.84
was made

4560.48 --> 4567.839999999999
for this as a test

4568.08 --> 4571.679
originally at least and that's kind of

4570.719 --> 4574.159
like

4571.679 --> 4575.36
how i regard it like it's it's like an

4574.159 --> 4579.599999999999
adult who

4575.36 --> 4582.32
test like are you

4579.6 --> 4584.56
smart or it well not even like super

4582.32 --> 4586.08
smart a calculus smart but are you just

4584.56 --> 4589.6
critical thinking smart

4586.08 --> 4592.5599999999995
enough to withstand the globe

4589.6 --> 4594.400000000001
and figure out that people are being

4592.56 --> 4596.88
manipulated with lies

4594.4 --> 4597.759999999999
and and all that are you smart enough to

4596.88 --> 4600.0
figure it out

4597.76 --> 4602.4800000000005
it seems like the ball earth was

4600.0 --> 4604.48
originally designed for this

4602.48 --> 4607.678999999999
now whatever they're using it for right

4604.48 --> 4609.919999999999
now it doesn't seem like

4607.679 --> 4611.28
there's any more care about it it's more

4609.92 --> 4613.84
like

4611.28 --> 4616.0
a thing that was meant as a testing tool

4613.84 --> 4619.1990000000005
is now being used

4616.0 --> 4621.679
more to actually make it make people

4619.199 --> 4624.879999999999
stupid instead

4621.679 --> 4627.04
right i believe that maybe originally

4624.88 --> 4630.08
the globe was like a

4627.04 --> 4632.32
a test of priesthood like

4630.08 --> 4633.28
are you smart enough to figure out that

4632.32 --> 4636.799999999999
people

4633.28 --> 4640.88
are very gullible effectively and

4636.8 --> 4643.6
practically know this through this test

4640.88 --> 4644.64
and that later it just became like a

4643.6 --> 4648.120000000001
just a

4644.64 --> 4650.400000000001
social engineering toy and then became

4648.12 --> 4652.48
corporatized and now it's just satanic

4650.4 --> 4656.32
abuse and [ __ ] right i don't think it

4652.48 --> 4656.32
started out that way i really don't

4656.96 --> 4660.8
but maybe that's just because i

4660.96 --> 4679.84
too good nature to believe that it was

4664.239 --> 4679.839999999999
always this bad

4684.4 --> 4687.44
how is daily life different believing in

4686.0 --> 4689.12
the ball story versus knowing the earth

4687.44 --> 4693.839999999999
is flat and stationary

4689.12 --> 4693.84
well because of the associations

4694.719 --> 4702.2390000000005
people that now through mainstream

4698.88 --> 4706.08
to try to indoctrinate people

4702.239 --> 4710.08
bend them to their will basically

4706.08 --> 4712.08
virtue signal to we are part of science

4710.08 --> 4715.36
we know better we're the ruling

4712.08 --> 4718.64
people that tell you it's a ball

4715.36 --> 4719.28
right that's the difference well if

4718.64 --> 4721.679
you're

4719.28 --> 4724.08
a flat earther you've already probably

4721.679 --> 4724.4800000000005
been partially rejected and all you will

4724.08 --> 4727.5199999999995
see

4724.48 --> 4732.159
that and then you will

4727.52 --> 4734.719
very wisely step away from engaging

4732.159 --> 4736.799999999999
in the sheep play you could call it a

4734.719 --> 4741.04
sheep play

4736.8 --> 4743.92
just the globe theater where people

4741.04 --> 4744.96
just go with the narrative hand it down

4743.92 --> 4746.96
to them because

4744.96 --> 4749.679
it's handed down from a point of

4746.96 --> 4751.199
authority using the globe as the mind

4749.679 --> 4756.4800000000005
control

4751.199 --> 4758.159
tool part of it it's part of that scape

4756.48 --> 4759.839999999999
like and everything that it implies

4758.159 --> 4763.12
right the globe

4759.84 --> 4764.8
has now been associated with atheism and

4763.12 --> 4767.04
evolution

4764.8 --> 4767.04
and

4768.4 --> 4772.159
yeah amorality all kinds of things have

4771.52 --> 4775.4400000000005
all been

4772.159 --> 4779.679
stuck on it has become very dark

4775.44 --> 4791.839999999999
in many ways and that is all drawn in

4779.679 --> 4791.84
every time

4805.84 --> 4811.92
hey aaron brown good to see you nice

4809.92 --> 4819.84
what are you doing rasta clutch bear

4811.92 --> 4819.84
what's going on

4827.36 --> 4834.4
yeah dude clutch bear down

4830.639 --> 4834.400000000001
rasta hat is just rust ahead

4834.48 --> 4836.718999999999
is

4838.639 --> 4846.08
look it just

4842.159 --> 4847.5199999999995
it's difficult it just gets a bit like

4846.08 --> 4851.12
that sometimes

4847.52 --> 4853.1990000000005
look he's just he just has a

4851.12 --> 4855.92
a lot of negative feelings towards

4853.199 --> 4858.879999999999
people that lie towards themselves right

4855.92 --> 4860.719
he's very passionate about that so

4858.88 --> 4863.12
you'll just have to excuse him

4860.719 --> 4863.12
for it

4865.12 --> 4868.8
he knows not to take it too far

4870.4 --> 4875.839999999999
but he probably takes it a bit further

4872.719 --> 4875.84
than you appreciate

4883.76 --> 4887.360000000001
i'm choosing to stoop to their level my

4886.239 --> 4892.239
choice

4887.36 --> 4894.88
there we go what can i say to that

4892.239 --> 4895.759999999999
if it's your choice it's your choice

4894.88 --> 4897.52
right

4895.76 --> 4899.6
i don't think i'm gonna have anybody on

4897.52 --> 4903.4400000000005
by the way

4899.6 --> 4908.2390000000005
still got 40 minutes but that

4903.44 --> 4908.239
seems like a good hangout so far

4912.08 --> 4917.84
i'll be back in two minutes

5012.84 --> 5015.84
yep

5032.0 --> 5034.48
indeed

5035.84 --> 5043.52
yes you do start to spot just

5038.96 --> 5046.08
logical fallacies thinking errors

5043.52 --> 5047.6
there's a lot about psychology you learn

5046.08 --> 5049.28
through flat earth that i have learned

5047.6 --> 5050.96
through flat earth and i see it

5049.28 --> 5057.84
constantly now

5050.96 --> 5057.84
it's like it's been automated

5058.0 --> 5062.0
it's it's so automated that when i spot

5060.719 --> 5062.88
people or in the middle of a

5062.0 --> 5064.639
conversation

5062.88 --> 5065.92
i am with somebody in the middle of

5064.639 --> 5068.0
conversation and they do

5065.92 --> 5070.159
something like that i don't even get

5068.0 --> 5072.639
angry over it now

5070.159 --> 5072.638999999999
i just

5073.36 --> 5076.639
know how to deal with it

5077.6 --> 5081.679
and that also surprises a lot of people

5082.08 --> 5085.44
that i just literally on the spot can

5084.48 --> 5088.5599999999995
just like

5085.44 --> 5090.719
look at them and almost telepathically

5088.56 --> 5094.080000000001
communicate exactly

5090.719 --> 5099.31
how they're in error instead of

5094.08 --> 5105.759
taking the by taking the bait

5099.31 --> 5105.759
[Music]

5123.199 --> 5132.08
no clutch bear i know rasta hat

5127.44 --> 5132.08
he's he's not he's not like that

5132.719 --> 5138.2390000000005
i've known arasta hat for a long long

5134.8 --> 5138.2390000000005
time longer than i have you

5138.84 --> 5141.84
so

5152.84 --> 5155.84
hmm

5172.639 --> 5176.0
if i'd had to summarize what you're

5174.639 --> 5179.36
having an issue with

5176.0 --> 5183.12
is that rasta hat is very

5179.36 --> 5186.88
direct and unrelenting

5183.12 --> 5186.88
that's just the way he is

5197.6 --> 5210.639
i went 20s how is that awesome that's

5200.88 --> 5212.400000000001
that's gross

5210.639 --> 5214.4800000000005
ah that's good to hear s smith i'm

5212.4 --> 5215.679
really glad that that's working out for

5214.48 --> 5219.44
you

5215.679 --> 5222.32
i i do appreciate it too a lot

5219.44 --> 5223.678999999999
because i used to be a somebody that

5222.32 --> 5226.88
would take the bait and

5223.679 --> 5229.679
get my own machinations going like hey

5226.88 --> 5231.4400000000005
i was a glober and i used globe

5229.679 --> 5234.8
machinations too and

5231.44 --> 5237.678999999999
outside of the globe mechanisms i

5234.8 --> 5239.76
did that sort of thing too i i was at

5237.679 --> 5240.639
times very manipulative when i was

5239.76 --> 5244.08
younger

5240.639 --> 5248.0
but it was kind of subconscious it just

5244.08 --> 5251.679
seemed like that's the way to do that

5248.0 --> 5254.08
to just kind of like outsmart people

5251.679 --> 5257.1990000000005
and then win an argument but in

5254.08 --> 5259.679
retrospect it's really petty

5257.199 --> 5262.08
and i don't do that anymore now i

5259.679 --> 5264.4800000000005
haven't for a long time

5262.08 --> 5265.6
and it has definitely improved just my

5264.48 --> 5270.32
overall

5265.6 --> 5274.96
energy other people don't

5270.32 --> 5276.5599999999995
get negative towards me

5274.96 --> 5278.32
they have a problem they tend to rather

5276.56 --> 5280.6
avoid me they don't

5278.32 --> 5283.5199999999995
i don't get into like face-to-face

5280.6 --> 5295.84
confrontations like ever

5283.52 --> 5295.84
doesn't happen anymore

5316.88 --> 5323.76
wow man i've this is a great

5320.0 --> 5324.96
chat today 38 watching hey flat side i

5323.76 --> 5327.360000000001
was wondering when you were going to

5324.96 --> 5330.08
show up

5327.36 --> 5330.799999999999
you still want to come on in last half

5330.08 --> 5332.96
hour

5330.8 --> 5336.320000000001
or you're just going to join the flat

5332.96 --> 5338.719
earth debate pre-show

5336.32 --> 5338.719
you like

5341.679 --> 5345.679
wisdom comes with age yeah it does

5346.56 --> 5351.1990000000005
it's i got a weird story about that

5348.8 --> 5356.400000000001
because when i was younger

5351.199 --> 5359.12
i really understood that i understood

5356.4 --> 5360.239
like i am going to be a lot smarter and

5359.12 --> 5363.04
wiser and i would be

5360.239 --> 5364.0
so impressed if i could just see myself

5363.04 --> 5368.4
as i'm how i

5364.0 --> 5372.0
will potentially be the problem that

5368.4 --> 5374.159
was though that

5372.0 --> 5375.36
even though i literally could feel it

5374.159 --> 5378.5599999999995
and know that

5375.36 --> 5380.5599999999995
i couldn't apply it and i i needed it

5378.56 --> 5383.1990000000005
then

5380.56 --> 5385.360000000001
it's weird to know like i will have

5383.199 --> 5386.5599999999995
wisdom but i don't have it now and i

5385.36 --> 5390.32
need it now

5386.56 --> 5393.360000000001
and that was kind of terrible that's

5390.32 --> 5397.199
potentially the downside of being very

5393.36 --> 5399.599999999999
conscious and smart like that intuitive

5397.199 --> 5401.36
when you're extremely young and you

5399.6 --> 5405.1990000000005
don't have somebody that's just

5401.36 --> 5405.199
literally on your strength level

5405.84 --> 5408.96
that guide your parents my parents were

5408.0 --> 5411.52
just

5408.96 --> 5412.159
like at first they did pretty well they

5411.52 --> 5415.120000000001
definitely

5412.159 --> 5416.32
gave they recognized my intelligence and

5415.12 --> 5419.76
tried to

5416.32 --> 5422.48
give me stuff to do with it

5419.76 --> 5424.56
to challenge me but then later as soon

5422.48 --> 5425.5199999999995
as i kind of became a teenager it all

5424.56 --> 5428.8
just

5425.52 --> 5430.4800000000005
it started to go to [ __ ] like between my

5428.8 --> 5434.56
parents

5430.48 --> 5437.678999999999
and then they like i turned away

5434.56 --> 5437.679
from me

5438.239 --> 5443.36
and then instead

5441.28 --> 5444.32
well ended up trying to kind of like be

5443.36 --> 5447.28
psychologist

5444.32 --> 5450.0
of the house to try to figure out how i

5447.28 --> 5450.719
could stabilize the situation so that i

5450.0 --> 5455.12
wouldn't lose

5450.719 --> 5455.12
everything right

5458.88 --> 5462.08
and that yeah i'm not gonna even blame

5461.36 --> 5464.48
like my

5462.08 --> 5468.0
life how it went on that but it

5464.48 --> 5471.12
certainly did not help me

5468.0 --> 5473.679
learn how to like become self-sufficient

5471.12 --> 5476.4
and more adult-like in the world out

5473.679 --> 5479.12
there learning how to get a job

5476.4 --> 5479.679
because i had a lot of trouble with that

5479.12 --> 5481.5199999999995
like

5479.679 --> 5483.84
sort of the hermit effect that i'm still

5481.52 --> 5487.6
kind of stuck in

5483.84 --> 5490.56
and my parents just couldn't get me

5487.6 --> 5492.08
to do that because when they did and

5490.56 --> 5494.080000000001
they tried to

5492.08 --> 5496.4
claim some authority over me i would

5494.08 --> 5499.199
literally just point at them and like

5496.4 --> 5500.879999999999
look at your life you're literally

5499.199 --> 5503.199
[ __ ] it up right now you're

5500.88 --> 5504.0
postponing [ __ ] right now you're denying

5503.199 --> 5507.04
this and that

5504.0 --> 5508.159
right now you can't have authority over

5507.04 --> 5511.76
me

5508.159 --> 5511.759999999999
well i needed that

5516.84 --> 5519.84
ah

5524.88 --> 5530.719
i needed them to fix it

5528.239 --> 5531.599999999999
so that they could help gain control

5530.719 --> 5535.36
over me

5531.6 --> 5540.320000000001
and help me get control over my life

5535.36 --> 5540.32
they couldn't they couldn't do it

5543.84 --> 5549.360000000001

yeah yeah thanks for joining the chat

5715.04 --> 5719.04
can i ask how how did you find me i tend

5717.679 --> 5721.679
to ask that to

5719.04 --> 5721.679
newcomers

5724.32 --> 5743.84
i'm always interested how the flow of

5726.719 --> 5743.84
connections happen here on youtube

5756.88 --> 5760.719
from nathan's show okay cool

5769.6 --> 5772.88
got someone telling me mythbusters is

5771.92 --> 5776.159
reality

5772.88 --> 5777.4400000000005
really that the same myth busters that

5776.159 --> 5781.36
also claim that

5777.44 --> 5785.839999999999
jet fuel can actually melt

5781.36 --> 5785.839999999999
steel frame buildings

5786.639 --> 5794.159000000001
like before that happened they were

5790.88 --> 5796.84
okay after that they were just

5794.159 --> 5799.28
it was just done it was just the shield

5796.84 --> 5801.84
factory

5799.28 --> 5803.199
like both of them also just lost their

5801.84 --> 5806.0
vibe

5803.199 --> 5806.799999999999
completely they just became shills it

5806.0 --> 5809.6
was very

5806.8 --> 5813.28
disappointing i really like mythbusters

5809.6 --> 5815.76
before that

5813.28 --> 5816.8
they just made you think and after that

5815.76 --> 5826.56
it would just

5816.8 --> 5841.4400000000005
became like propaganda [ __ ]

5826.56 --> 5843.679
what's my thoughts on gnosticism

5841.44 --> 5843.678999999999
i

5847.52 --> 5855.84
i don't know i don't know

5850.8 --> 5855.84
enough about it

5866.84 --> 5869.84
so

5874.48 --> 5877.759999999999
it's like exactly what about gnosticism

5877.44 --> 5879.599999999999
right

5877.76 --> 5883.84
if you ask something like that i'll be

5879.6 --> 5883.84
able to respond but just if you

5884.159 --> 5888.239
it's just like asking like what do you

5885.84 --> 5890.8
think about christianity like oh

5888.239 --> 5890.799999999999
jesus

5891.52 --> 5899.119000000001
that's quite a broad question

5895.679 --> 5900.88
right i can't just judge that entire

5899.119 --> 5911.839999999999
thing

5900.88 --> 5911.84
there's a lot of complex things in there

5913.84 --> 5917.360000000001
never trust the silent g

5922.84 --> 5925.84
okay

5936.84 --> 5943.4400000000005
so

5939.199 --> 5947.599999999999
well it's rufus and hubbins dude

5943.44 --> 5950.5599999999995
uh ballers in real life

5947.6 --> 5952.56
or if they go nasty on you and do

5950.56 --> 5955.119000000001
exactly what like

5952.56 --> 5956.96
baller trolls do in chat if you if they

5955.119 --> 5958.719
do that to your face and just start

5956.96 --> 5962.4
disrespecting you

5958.719 --> 5966.08
yeah you bet there's gonna be a response

5962.4 --> 5969.199
right and it wouldn't

5966.08 --> 5970.0
i if they did like that to me and kept

5969.199 --> 5971.759999999999
on pushing it

5970.0 --> 5973.679
yeah i will absolutely call them

5971.76 --> 5978.88
religious zealots and i would

5973.679 --> 5980.4800000000005
get on them exactly like i do here

5978.88 --> 5982.719
but they would have to push it right

5980.48 --> 5984.879999999999
it's not like oh they're gonna just have

5982.719 --> 5985.119
a superficial baller response and then

5984.88 --> 5987.119
i'm

5985.119 --> 5989.36
immediately gonna unload on them of

5987.119 --> 5990.239
course not but if they actually think

5989.36 --> 5992.32
like oh

5990.239 --> 5994.0
we're going to dominate him because he's

5992.32 --> 5998.5599999999995
a stupid flat earther

5994.0 --> 6002.48
yeah you got something coming then right

5998.56 --> 6002.4800000000005
you're gonna see the full our win

6004.48 --> 6009.839999999999
i'm not gonna hold back if you think you

6006.159 --> 6009.839999999999
can do that

6024.88 --> 6037.84
dave was being polite what

6038.719 --> 6042.4
right yes flat side it is

6042.719 --> 6050.32
it right in a way

6046.32 --> 6052.96
the more disrespect they show

6050.32 --> 6054.32
the more dissatisfied they actually are

6052.96 --> 6057.6
with their own life

6054.32 --> 6061.44
so they need to yeah

6057.6 --> 6062.320000000001
things that wake them up in some form or

6061.44 --> 6063.919999999999
another

6062.32 --> 6066.96
to that fact that they're really

6063.92 --> 6070.0
dissatisfied about themselves really

6066.96 --> 6071.84
they need to yeah attack that

6070.0 --> 6073.679
right it's like attacking the light the

6071.84 --> 6075.119000000001
light's too bright attack it because it

6073.679 --> 6078.2390000000005
hurts

6075.119 --> 6081.839999999999
that's effectively how that works

6078.239 --> 6085.36
that's also why i take great care to not

6081.84 --> 6089.04
out there just start like like shouting

6085.36 --> 6089.04
out about flat earth or anything

6089.28 --> 6093.599999999999
just subtly out of nowhere start

6091.6 --> 6094.88
basically shining light on people like

6093.6 --> 6096.88
that

6094.88 --> 6099.28
no i always bring it very carefully

6096.88 --> 6101.76
first test the waters test if they could

6099.28 --> 6104.5599999999995
actually handle something like that

6101.76 --> 6105.119000000001
carefully carefully inquire like how

6104.56 --> 6107.52
much

6105.119 --> 6109.199
understanding do you have about

6107.52 --> 6111.92
conspiracy theory

6109.199 --> 6114.0
are you even interested in anything do

6111.92 --> 6116.0
you have any doubts about things going

6114.0 --> 6117.84
on in the world

6116.0 --> 6119.199
let's start with like politics what do

6117.84 --> 6122.32
you think of that right

6119.199 --> 6123.5199999999995
like always you have to basically start

6122.32 --> 6126.48
breaking it to them

6123.52 --> 6127.4400000000005
how much lies there really is so let's

6126.48 --> 6129.28
start with this

6127.44 --> 6130.96
with the starting point let's see how

6129.28 --> 6133.28
much they've already detected

6130.96 --> 6134.0
and as soon as they figure out like yeah

6133.28 --> 6136.08
you're right

6134.0 --> 6137.28
there is a lot of nonsense going on out

6136.08 --> 6140.0
there

6137.28 --> 6141.199
then you got a foot in the door and then

6140.0 --> 6144.159
you can say

6141.199 --> 6145.44
well what if i told you that it reaches

6144.159 --> 6147.119
even further

6145.44 --> 6150.96
and i have a lot of evidence for that

6147.119 --> 6154.0
and historical background and everything

6150.96 --> 6154.8
and then then it's much harder for them

6154.0 --> 6157.92
to evade

6154.8 --> 6161.04
right but if they are just completely

6157.92 --> 6162.32
statist and like they can accept any

6161.04 --> 6165.44
lies to be

6162.32 --> 6177.84
lies yeah there's no use talking to them

6165.44 --> 6177.839999999999
about flat earth

6188.84 --> 6193.6
uh

6191.28 --> 6196.88
yes rufus we were all asking about

6193.6 --> 6199.84
gravity because he brought it up

6196.88 --> 6202.32
and yeah he never really presented any

6199.84 --> 6202.32
evidence

6203.199 --> 6205.839999999999
so

6219.679 --> 6233.84
hey dutch sailor good to see you

6234.32 --> 6240.96
lolz i think there's like a dutch

6237.44 --> 6240.96
live concert out there

6241.679 --> 6247.84
dutch slagger music

6258.84 --> 6261.84
is

6273.44 --> 6277.199
uh oh

6277.44 --> 6283.36
that said okay 500 people damn that's a

6286.84 --> 6289.84
lot

6291.84 --> 6294.719
what s smith

6301.44 --> 6304.5599999999995
yeah i'm not a big fan of that type of

6303.76 --> 6307.280000000001
music too

6304.56 --> 6307.280000000001
never was

6307.6 --> 6311.360000000001
my mother even hated it so i was like oh

6310.719 --> 6315.52
god

6311.36 --> 6320.239
a terrible dutch music but

6315.52 --> 6320.2390000000005
yeah i don't know i'm

6320.88 --> 6324.4800000000005
i'm just happy that somebody is just at

6323.84 --> 6328.2390000000005
least like

6324.48 --> 6328.239
trying to have a party or something you

6328.84 --> 6333.4400000000005
know

6330.08 --> 6333.44
is really nice weather so

6338.0 --> 6345.84
i got dutch clogs you mean the

6341.84 --> 6345.84
the wooden shoes no i don't

6367.92 --> 6372.56
you had a pair when you were younger

6370.239 --> 6375.36
well look clogs can be very useful if

6372.56 --> 6375.360000000001
you're on a farm

6376.159 --> 6381.119
especially if it's muddy a lot right

6379.119 --> 6382.96
that's why they're used to basically get

6381.119 --> 6383.92
around through the mud and not get stuck

6382.96 --> 6387.92
all the time

6383.92 --> 6390.0
i think but yeah i

6387.92 --> 6391.679
i used to live for a very long time

6390.0 --> 6395.199
across a farm

6391.679 --> 6395.52
and they used clogs and i did try it it

6395.199 --> 6398.799999999999
just

6395.52 --> 6403.679
hurts my feet like i really hate clogs

6398.8 --> 6406.719
they hurt i don't like them at all

6403.679 --> 6415.84
i'd rather just wear rubber boots

6406.719 --> 6415.84
even though you might get stuck

6426.96 --> 6446.719
hey mark collard good to see you

6442.4 --> 6451.599999999999
oh [ __ ] party person to saturn

6446.719 --> 6451.6
that's that sounds just typical

6452.96 --> 6456.159
so he was so confident it wasn't going

6455.28 --> 6458.0
to be impossible

6456.159 --> 6461.36
that when you actually did it he just

6458.0 --> 6461.36
got totally triggered that's

6461.679 --> 6471.84
that's very annoying

6476.639 --> 6480.719
carbon fiber clocks what

6482.96 --> 6485.84
okay

6501.31 --> 6504.609
[Music]

6514.159 --> 6517.5199999999995
man this chat is buzzing

6521.75 --> 6527.84
[Music]

6524.84 --> 6527.84
awesome

6542.719 --> 6546.4800000000005
you can't bring a horse to water but you

6545.04 --> 6550.96
can

6546.48 --> 6550.959999999999
make it critically drink

6553.599 --> 6569.84
think yeah i know

6572.56 --> 6579.599
what what is it more colored

6576.8 --> 6579.599
why are you sick

6580.639 --> 6584.400000000001
isn't that awesome if he's getting his

6583.36 --> 6587.28
driver's license

6584.4 --> 6587.28
that's cool right

6587.92 --> 6597.84
or are you just very nervous about it

6590.4 --> 6597.839999999999
for him

6602.239 --> 6604.959999999999
terrifying

6608.84 --> 6611.84
nah

6613.52 --> 6619.92
if he's getting his license that means

6615.44 --> 6619.919999999999
he's already capable of driving pretty

6622.84 --> 6628.2390000000005
much

6624.639 --> 6639.84
oh right okay yeah that can be a little

6628.239 --> 6639.839999999999
unnerving i guess

6650.84 --> 6653.84
um

6654.56 --> 6667.84
yeah they always grow up don't they

6678.84 --> 6681.84
hmm

6687.599 --> 6691.360000000001
driving is a commercial egg

6692.84 --> 6695.84
uh

6698.56 --> 6700.8
what

6707.599 --> 6711.599
i don't know having a car and being able

6710.719 --> 6723.199
to drive it

6711.599 --> 6736.88
can be very convenient

6723.199 --> 6738.879999999999
coriolis debris what well how about just

6736.88 --> 6741.52
satellite debris

6738.88 --> 6742.0
right and since there's already kind of

6741.52 --> 6745.1990000000005
like

6742.0 --> 6746.0
satellites coming down from balloons and

6745.199 --> 6749.678999999999
all that

6746.0 --> 6750.639
like it's it's a pretty lucky that

6749.679 --> 6752.4
nobody's been

6750.639 --> 6755.4400000000005
killed by one of those satellites

6752.4 --> 6755.44
dropping down yet

6755.52 --> 6760.8
right because it's just in the middle

6758.96 --> 6765.84
just coming down in the sky could

6760.8 --> 6765.84
literally land right on somebody's head

6786.239 --> 6790.839999999999
license means permission to commit a

6788.719 --> 6793.84
crime

6790.84 --> 6793.84
what

6795.04 --> 6800.32
well no that's self-contradictory

6798.32 --> 6802.88
permission to commit a crime is

6800.32 --> 6804.96
literally self-contradictory

6802.88 --> 6806.159000000001
if you have permission it's no longer a

6804.96 --> 6821.84
crime that's

6806.159 --> 6821.839999999999
part of the point

6830.639 --> 6833.679
there's little reason to have dedicated

6832.4 --> 6836.879999999999
satellites

6833.679 --> 6840.08
i don't know mark's colored look

6836.88 --> 6842.4800000000005
i think just a few blimps would do a

6840.08 --> 6844.639
whole lot

6842.48 --> 6847.28
and they would be flying much higher

6844.639 --> 6850.8
than airplanes usually do

6847.28 --> 6853.599
right and hey you can literally

6850.8 --> 6856.08
land a blimp you could just say okay

6853.599 --> 6858.2390000000005
it's been up there for a while

6856.08 --> 6859.76
let's send out the new one bring this

6858.239 --> 6862.718999999999
one down maintenance

6859.76 --> 6865.84
update some equipment perhaps to more

6862.719 --> 6869.28
modern technical standards

6865.84 --> 6872.0
and yeah send it back up

6869.28 --> 6872.48
like a satellite hanging on a balloon

6872.0 --> 6877.52
really

6872.48 --> 6879.919999999999
is in a way kind of a cheap ass solution

6877.52 --> 6882.56
if you'd use zeppelins that would be

6879.92 --> 6882.56
much more

6882.88 --> 6889.679
maintainable maintenance would be easier

6887.84 --> 6891.119000000001
you wouldn't have to constantly send up

6889.679 --> 6905.84
new stuff

6891.119 --> 6905.839999999999
that would eventually come crashing down

6921.119 --> 6933.839999999999
okay all right

6944.88 --> 6948.639
now the funny thing is is if you combine

6947.28 --> 6952.48
a weather balloon

6948.639 --> 6954.08
and drone then you actually have kind of

6952.48 --> 6957.199
a zeppelin

6954.08 --> 6959.679
right because the zeppelin is basically

6957.199 --> 6963.04
just a balloon

6959.679 --> 6975.84
with steering capability an extra

6963.04 --> 6975.84
fan to move in the direction

6987.76 --> 6989.84
you

7011.679 --> 7015.4400000000005
thanks rufus and hobbins i'd like to

7013.76 --> 7017.92
think so i'd like to think

7015.44 --> 7019.759999999999
that my audience and my chat

7017.92 --> 7023.52
participation is

7019.76 --> 7031.84
has a great variety

7023.52 --> 7031.84
i take that as a compliment

7033.04 --> 7037.119
and they're all yeah everybody's welcome

7035.44 --> 7045.839999999999
as long as they abide by

7037.119 --> 7045.839999999999
the rules which is just civil conduct

7059.04 --> 7064.159
well earthy caster look i understand

7062.48 --> 7066.4
your plight

7064.159 --> 7068.879999999999
but yeah what what are you gonna do

7066.4 --> 7068.879999999999
about it

7070.159 --> 7073.36
right the only thing you can do about it

7072.8 --> 7076.4800000000005
is

7073.36 --> 7079.36
go to the government and kind of make

7076.48 --> 7081.28
them take away that license system again

7079.36 --> 7082.719
so anybody can do it but yeah that

7081.28 --> 7086.239
brings

7082.719 --> 7090.96
look licenses are for regulation

7086.239 --> 7090.959999999999
that's what they're really for for

7098.84 --> 7101.84
regulation

7115.199 --> 7118.638999999999
all right i appreciate it rufus st
