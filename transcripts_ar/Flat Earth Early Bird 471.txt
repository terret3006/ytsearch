147.459 --> 162.73000000000002
edition right so yeah I'm a bit bit slow

160.15 --> 164.35
because yes yeah I did actually go to

162.73 --> 170.76999999999998
bed pretty early for am i doing but

164.35 --> 173.82999999999998
yesterday I I I don't know I was like in

170.77 --> 175.69
an accelerated mood and I did something

173.83 --> 178.84
stupid for my doing and that is like

175.69 --> 181.48
taking extra beer I thought oh yeah sure

178.84 --> 185.25
I could take that well turned out that

181.48 --> 189.54899999999998
that extra beer somehow it hit me wrong

185.25 --> 191.2
for some reason even though yeah I think

189.549 --> 193.36
we are pretty much every day but just

191.2 --> 196.959
seems like this one was too much it may

193.36 --> 199.51000000000002
also have to do with my dinner it that

196.959 --> 203.14000000000001
same dinner impacted me also the day

199.51 --> 206.5
before did it again this time a few

203.14 --> 208.45
beers then ate and just bang I got so

206.5 --> 213.4
tired out that even during the ball

208.45 --> 216.57999999999998
busters livestream I just I laid down on

213.4 --> 222.03
my bed on the bed like a half of the

216.58 --> 225.28
show how many did you drink well for

222.03 --> 231.09
usually I max at 3 and this time I take

225.28 --> 242.25
4 although they are half liters

231.09 --> 245.269
so for these and what I don't know it

242.25 --> 252.84
seems like it was a little bit too much

245.269 --> 259.1
yeah but I'll be alright it's also just

252.84 --> 263.43
not really great weather today and this

259.1 --> 269.70000000000005
yesterday was pretty good its beer it's

263.43 --> 272.52
just beer just beer as basic a beer as

269.7 --> 275.78999999999996
they come super standard super standard

272.52 --> 279.59999999999997
alcohol differences it's organic that's

275.79 --> 281.63
it nothing special nothing out of the

279.6 --> 281.63
ordinary

283.5 --> 292.35
[Music]

286.22 --> 295.37
yeah I bet it is Major Tom well I can my

292.35 --> 295.37
body can't handle that

301.31 --> 304.47
[Music]

306.42 --> 309.42
there

310.68 --> 324.47
five 5% it's just beer and I don't want

320.669 --> 324.46999999999997
to talk about beer if you don't mind

326.539 --> 338.09999999999997
so yeah but I did miss out on the rest

333.81 --> 341.61
of the night so because I think I went

338.1 --> 343.82000000000005
to bed like one o'clock something like

341.61 --> 343.82
that

351.159 --> 355.229
five percent I think it is

357.12 --> 364.979
it may be not some half beer but it's

360.69 --> 371.639
just the standard beer alcohol it's

364.979 --> 372.419
pretty universal anyway I did enjoy it

371.639 --> 375.3
but it just

372.419 --> 379.169
he'd been wrong so I don't know my

375.3 --> 382.71000000000004
stomach is like a bit acidic just seems

379.169 --> 385.04999999999995
and I I did get it pretty early had

382.71 --> 390.09
breakfast and I also had a walk outside

385.05 --> 392.37
that that tent tends to do me good when

390.09 --> 394.21999999999997
he had a little bit too much to drink so

392.37 --> 398.12
I feel pretty good okay

394.22 --> 401.01000000000005
although yeah just it's odd because I

398.12 --> 403.38
feel tired even though I've slept a lot

401.01 --> 409.949
but I guess that's just normal when that

403.38 --> 413.46
happens right plain truth it's having a

409.949 --> 415.02000000000004
hangout right before the show I don't

413.46 --> 422.31
know if he's still going I haven't

415.02 --> 424.79999999999995
checked up he had Holly on so it looked

422.31 --> 428.07
at that for a bit also watched back old

424.8 --> 434.22
Owen Benjamin clips especially from

428.07 --> 436.52
mountain bear so that was fun Luhan a

434.22 --> 436.52000000000004
koala

443.389 --> 447.759
right your Sanford I bet it is

464.83 --> 470.44899999999996
anyway yeah a gym there are a lot

468.05 --> 473.419
stronger alcohol beers here it's like

470.449 --> 476.75
look any type of alcohol you could ever

473.419 --> 481.669
think off you can get it yeah I can get

476.75 --> 486.199
it I don't though because I am NOT like

481.669 --> 489.53
that in general I really don't even like

486.199 --> 501.71000000000004
alcoholic drinks just happen to like

489.53 --> 506.9
beer if I don't take too much of it yeah

501.71 --> 511.729
right so all right yeah I started my

506.9 --> 514.3389999999999
GoFundMe for the for the fresh air fresh

511.729 --> 516.68
air for our win so I put the link up a

514.339 --> 520.5500000000001
little bit earlier I don't know if you

516.68 --> 525.1999999999999
guys still get there I already posted so

520.55 --> 525.5889999999999
yeah anyone wants that once - that's not

525.2 --> 531.5500000000001
good

525.589 --> 534.9100000000001
it wants to contribute III

531.55 --> 539.5889999999999
you I have it I also updated the

534.91 --> 546.26
subscription or the the description box

539.589 --> 548.99
as - yeah the GoFundMe is in there again

546.26 --> 552.23
because I removed it since the the old

548.99 --> 555.26
one wasn't really functional so yeah

552.23 --> 558.529
anyone that wants to help me out get me

555.26 --> 560.8389999999999
some fresh air please do so it may seem

558.529 --> 563.99
a little expensive the system compared

560.839 --> 565.6990000000001
to a lot of prefab stuff that I bet you

563.99 --> 570.41
can get a lot cheaper out there I know I

565.699 --> 574.579
know I know but this system is kind of

570.41 --> 578.24
easy to maintain I get it I've yeah I

574.579 --> 581.81
can disassemble it and reassemble it so

578.24 --> 583.66
that makes it very reliable for me I

581.81 --> 586.67
know what it has I know what it can do

583.66 --> 589.01
as replaceable parts which is kind of

586.67 --> 592.88
rare because most modern air filters are

589.01 --> 595.04
just prefab systems you may exchange

592.88 --> 596.72
certain type of filter elements and then

595.04 --> 597.1999999999999
at some point it just freakin breaks and

596.72 --> 600.86
you throw

597.2 --> 603.86
way that's how most of them are and I

600.86 --> 606.62
don't want that I want a long-term

603.86 --> 609.11
device okay thanks for notifying that

606.62 --> 620.51
Chad is stuck I will refresh it right

609.11 --> 623.09
now so yeah it is kind of expensive it's

620.51 --> 626.36
also from the United States

623.09 --> 629.27
oddly enough I don't know exactly how it

626.36 --> 631.07
works but originally there was like a

629.27 --> 632.99
supplier in Europe and even in the

631.07 --> 636.35
Netherlands but apparently they don't do

632.99 --> 638.36
that anymore the whole setup that was

636.35 --> 640.61
there like 10 years ago still it's kind

638.36 --> 642.29
of been rearranged but the devices are

640.61 --> 646.85
still being produced and they're still

642.29 --> 650.87
good and I want another one so yeah if

646.85 --> 653.72
you please support my GoFundMe that will

650.87 --> 656.78
be very much appreciated don't know how

653.72 --> 661.51
fast it'll go but the sooner the better

656.78 --> 667.75
because I really want back an air filter

661.51 --> 667.75
anyway just link

674.07 --> 677.75
let's see if I got a better link

702.26 --> 708.18
right I don't Mahler's maintain the

705.75 --> 708.78
light because they don't know what else

708.18 --> 715.14
to do

708.78 --> 717.39
I think the ballers and all their

715.14 --> 719.0699999999999
machinations and even their lies and

717.39 --> 721.05
doublespeak I think they just carry on

719.07 --> 723.32
carrying on at this point because

721.05 --> 726.0
they've either been partially

723.32 --> 728.61
economically infested or they have

726.0 --> 730.74
personal honor invested in it and they

728.61 --> 733.77
don't want to stop bragging about that

730.74 --> 737.97
using that as a social leverage in their

733.77 --> 742.05
life or they just can't it's just very

737.97 --> 745.5600000000001
person and they can't let go of the of

742.05 --> 748.68
that need for it all to be real and to

745.56 --> 750.75
so that human humanity has some future

748.68 --> 753.62
hope of space travel and all that that

750.75 --> 756.57
could be okay all of those things and

753.62 --> 758.25
that's also what is in it for that

756.57 --> 765.24
that's what makes them keep on carrying

758.25 --> 767.64
on and keep on doing it but in the most

765.24 --> 772.46
direct sense it's basically trying to

767.64 --> 776.58
save face it is trying to maintain the

772.46 --> 779.6700000000001
advantages of the social order in which

776.58 --> 781.5300000000001
they are sort of intellectually elevated

779.67 --> 783.9499999999999
they're put on that higher scale in the

781.53 --> 787.62
in the in the grand scheme of things

783.95 --> 790.23
scheme emphasizing scheme right so

787.62 --> 793.55
that's why they keep going because as

790.23 --> 795.87
soon as they say yeah we were wrong

793.55 --> 797.9399999999999
everything everything they've done up to

795.87 --> 800.88
that point for them it will be

797.94 --> 803.73
completely for nothing they will have to

800.88 --> 805.32
start from scratch completely while

803.73 --> 808.5
they're pretty likely to already be

805.32 --> 812.6
pretty heavily invested if they came

808.5 --> 815.91
that for defending it so yeah

812.6 --> 818.5500000000001
Double Down syndrome the more you're

815.91 --> 821.36
invested the more likely you are going

818.55 --> 825.3499999999999
to absolutely double it down to the end

821.36 --> 825.35
it's a practical problem

835.98 --> 844.98
okay jor enough how I guess oh by the

841.83 --> 847.14
way thank you again for the super chat

844.98 --> 849.24
donation the other day and oh yeah I

847.14 --> 855.54
think good servant for the $1 ship which

849.24 --> 857.46
had donation I mean I with torn up that

855.54 --> 860.1899999999999
I mean the PayPal donation from the

857.46 --> 863.85
other day and special thanks did I

860.19 --> 868.7
mention it I don't think so but or did I

863.85 --> 872.88
I think I did yesterday that I got from

868.7 --> 875.37
from Samhain got me like 250 euro PayPal

872.88 --> 878.4
donation I was pretty massive still has

875.37 --> 880.65
to come in but yeah did very helpful

878.4 --> 884.88
yeah I did mention it of course I did

880.65 --> 887.6899999999999
and that's how I came no wait no it was

884.88 --> 893.01
at the end of yesterday's show right

887.69 --> 895.95
anyway much appreciated I still want to

893.01 --> 897.6
get this fresh air system going and it's

895.95 --> 899.9000000000001
gonna take some saving up I don't know

897.6 --> 903.0
if people will think it's worth it I

899.9 --> 909.81
swear I did not on purpose pick the most

903.0 --> 911.7
expensive thing I could find gave that

909.81 --> 915.7199999999999
for your alpha yeah he said that didn't

911.7 --> 918.72
he so I guess I will have to just fill

915.72 --> 923.3100000000001
it up as soon as I would get enough but

918.72 --> 929.48
I would need around I guess 270 more

923.31 --> 929.4799999999999
then and then I could directly order it

930.08 --> 939.83
is it George Sanford is it really it's a

937.14 --> 939.83
good system

951.38 --> 956.45
but on the other hand seems really

954.18 --> 959.7299999999999
pricey I know but I've been using

956.45 --> 962.6700000000001
exactly that system show up to your

959.73 --> 967.35
right here that's this thing see it's

962.67 --> 970.0799999999999
right there been using it for over a

967.35 --> 971.64
decade so I'm very well familiar with

970.08 --> 974.97
these systems and even know how to

971.64 --> 978.65
repair them which I'm pretty sure with a

974.97 --> 982.86
lot of cheaper systems you cannot do

978.65 --> 985.38
better they collect metadata on you so

982.86 --> 986.09
they depend on you throwing them away at

985.38 --> 998.07
some point

986.09 --> 1000.59
so yeah but I knew that some people were

998.07 --> 1004.5500000000001
gonna be they are less than enthusiastic

1000.59 --> 1006.86
about the price of it so yeah if it's

1004.55 --> 1008.87
not gonna work if I wasn't good enough

1006.86 --> 1010.4
you know know that you're just gonna

1008.87 --> 1012.8
have to do with the two hundred fifty

1010.4 --> 1016.64
euros nobody's going to give me anything

1012.8 --> 1020.9599999999999
well I guess I'll pick something lesser

1016.64 --> 1023.66
then but yeah I'm really hoping I can

1020.96 --> 1025.79
get the system that I'm used to that I

1023.66 --> 1029.5
know how to deal with and that I find

1025.79 --> 1029.5
very reliable on the long run

1038.16 --> 1045.41
yes it it can also produce ozone

1041.449 --> 1045.41
optionally that's right

1049.28 --> 1058.47
hello the Astro thief good serve it oh

1054.59 --> 1060.75
I'm not being negative I hope look I'm

1058.47 --> 1063.03
very serious guys like I really want

1060.75 --> 1066.51
this and I think I deserve it and I

1063.03 --> 1069.21
think I deserve the full price of it if

1066.51 --> 1073.3799999999999
I didn't I would not dare to put it even

1069.21 --> 1075.66
out there but I do and I will be patient

1073.38 --> 1079.5900000000001
it's just that if everybody that I

1075.66 --> 1082.71
respect you know is gonna complain about

1079.59 --> 1085.74
it yeah well you are the guys that are

1082.71 --> 1092.6100000000001
really giving me the foundation for me

1085.74 --> 1094.5
to keep on going on the show so ya can't

1092.61 --> 1098.1
always get what you want I realized that

1094.5 --> 1101.82
I am a street artist a beggar you can't

1098.1 --> 1105.84
expect a golden chair you know in that

1101.82 --> 1109.23
situation so I don't but I think this

1105.84 --> 1111.1999999999998
system is very good I think that buying

1109.23 --> 1116.49
this system even though it's pricey is

1111.2 --> 1119.24
probably worth more than two systems

1116.49 --> 1119.24
that are half the price

1128.93 --> 1131.969
[Music]

1133.01 --> 1138.54
yeah well George Sanford if you're just

1136.17 --> 1140.8500000000001
gonna complain about how you can get

1138.54 --> 1144.84
something cheaper or some part cheaper

1140.85 --> 1146.73
somewhere else anything but that that's

1144.84 --> 1158.1299999999999
very nice but you're not helping me at

1146.73 --> 1159.21
all what's the negative impact of not

1158.13 --> 1162.0300000000002
having the filter

1159.21 --> 1164.64
well the direct impact is there will be

1162.03 --> 1171.48
more dust I will literally as I sleep

1164.64 --> 1174.5700000000002
gather more dust also yeah I'm gonna

1171.48 --> 1177.33
have less oxygen in my system something

1174.57 --> 1180.0
I noticed and can say whatever you like

1177.33 --> 1183.6299999999999
about it this system it freakin creates

1180.0 --> 1187.14
oxygen noticeably for me I could just

1183.63 --> 1192.0900000000001
notice the difference breathing and yeah

1187.14 --> 1195.2990000000002
also it removes smell and I personally

1192.09 --> 1197.76
don't think I'm very smelly for a man so

1195.299 --> 1200.1
it's not like that kind of smell but

1197.76 --> 1202.65
it's just the general smell of being

1200.1 --> 1205.6789999999999
around you know sitting on the same

1202.65 --> 1207.66
chair a lot eventually things will

1205.679 --> 1211.71
basically start to smell if you don't

1207.66 --> 1214.169
like it gets super tidy clean and and

1211.71 --> 1216.75
bring everything to the dry cleaner and

1214.169 --> 1220.6200000000001
every day and all that so it's also a

1216.75 --> 1223.2
bit for my roommates at it now of course

1220.62 --> 1225.4799999999998
they're not gonna obliged doing the same

1223.2 --> 1228.1200000000001
because they freaking stink at times and

1225.48 --> 1231.33
even like deodorant and [ __ ] and after

1228.12 --> 1234.299
like I sometimes like need a mask just

1231.33 --> 1236.1899999999998
survive the freaking deodorants walking

1234.299 --> 1239.07
through that [ __ ] that's just disgusting

1236.19 --> 1242.28
man so it also helps for that it

1239.07 --> 1245.09
actually gets their stink away too and

1242.28 --> 1245.09
I've been missing that

1248.92 --> 1255.76
so yeah and I really appreciate this

1252.61 --> 1259.4499999999998
system it's odd because this thing has

1255.76 --> 1262.24
it has grown old like before it just

1259.45 --> 1266.05
died the probably the electronics is

1262.24 --> 1267.79
completely yea broken pretty sure the

1266.05 --> 1271.12
most expensive part of the machine is

1267.79 --> 1274.36
just completely trashed but before that

1271.12 --> 1277.12
it had after years and years and years

1274.36 --> 1281.2199999999998
of everyday being on non-stop all day

1277.12 --> 1284.77
long all day long years non-stop years

1281.22 --> 1287.8600000000001
okay talking about like 10 years every

1284.77 --> 1292.42
day non-stop on it has the last two

1287.86 --> 1298.87
years started to get like the what is it

1292.42 --> 1302.38
the the vent motor started to get a bit

1298.87 --> 1305.29
squeaky so there were some annoying

1302.38 --> 1307.9
things like the old age phenomena that

1305.29 --> 1310.68
it was starting to show and all that but

1307.9 --> 1315.22
yeah it held out incredibly long

1310.68 --> 1318.1000000000001
incredibly long yeah I'm talking about

1315.22 --> 1327.22
my fresh air that has been broken for

1318.1 --> 1330.1599999999999
now a week or so this thing and I'm yeah

1327.22 --> 1333.43
I'm asking for new funds through myself

1330.16 --> 1336.67
on me to get a new one but it's it's a

1333.43 --> 1340.8400000000001
bit pricey compared to other things out

1336.67 --> 1343.42
there but I think it's worth it it's

1340.84 --> 1346.2099999999998
specifically worth it because it's a

1343.42 --> 1349.42
reliable system that I know that is easy

1346.21 --> 1351.43
to self repair if you need to and it's

1349.42 --> 1355.39
just very dynamic and functional and

1351.43 --> 1358.75
like this big box over here it's not

1355.39 --> 1361.5700000000002
just for one room if I'd had like this

1358.75 --> 1364.69
entire apartment available I'd install

1361.57 --> 1366.28
it in the hallway like I did even when I

1364.69 --> 1369.1000000000001
still live with my ex in the previous

1366.28 --> 1371.47
house because this one machine can cover

1369.1 --> 1375.34
the entire house if needed

1371.47 --> 1377.38
just put the fan up higher and the

1375.34 --> 1380.4399999999998
purifier up higher and it will just

1377.38 --> 1382.659
cover the entire house it one piece can

1380.44 --> 1385.0900000000001
potentially filter any

1382.659 --> 1387.7
entire warehouse it'll be at max but it

1385.09 --> 1391.6589999999999
can because it's that freaking good and

1387.7 --> 1393.759
I know because I actually sold him like

1391.659 --> 1395.769
over ten years ago I did sell them

1393.759 --> 1399.519
successfully into several people

1395.769 --> 1401.59
including one of the people that is part

1399.519 --> 1404.6490000000001
of the chemtrails movie because it also

1401.59 --> 1410.009
helps against that provably it has been

1404.649 --> 1410.0089999999998
tested to help against that back then

1413.68 --> 1419.8300000000002
now yeah hm technically if I would

1417.52 --> 1422.83
recondition it the problem is all the

1419.83 --> 1424.81
parts are all outdated the newer version

1422.83 --> 1428.8899999999999
is like Version three this is like

1424.81 --> 1430.69
version one or two so the parts the

1428.89 --> 1434.2
newer parts don't even match anymore and

1430.69 --> 1436.99
it has gotten so many little age

1434.2 --> 1439.6000000000001
problems in almost everything so it's

1436.99 --> 1442.1200000000001
definitely up for a complete replacement

1439.6 --> 1445.4499999999998
because if I'd replace every part

1442.12 --> 1448.51
separately it probably would cost me

1445.45 --> 1452.74
just as much money and also a lot of

1448.51 --> 1455.86
time to do it like order parts wait for

1452.74 --> 1458.05
them and exchange and beat endless

1455.86 --> 1460.06
amounts of work at this moment you know

1458.05 --> 1462.8799999999999
if it was just one part that was broken

1460.06 --> 1466.6599999999999
then I could get that fixed but it's not

1462.88 --> 1470.0800000000002
just one it's really just yeah it's just

1466.66 --> 1472.6000000000001
trashed it's all it's too old now like

1470.08 --> 1475.6599999999999
even the plastic is to start certain

1472.6 --> 1477.3999999999999
types of plastic is seemingly starting

1475.66 --> 1479.8300000000002
to get brittle and then you know the

1477.4 --> 1483.0400000000002
whole thing is really getting old

1479.83 --> 1483.04
[Music]

1495.27 --> 1500.27
what are you talking about flat gloves

1498.36 --> 1506.57
what does this go my what are you

1500.27 --> 1506.57
talking about moon balloon what is this

1506.929 --> 1511.25
this is some kind of stupid joke

1520.83 --> 1534.03
key to the enigma as the point anyway

1530.76 --> 1536.46
yeah if you want to help me out little

1534.03 --> 1538.53
by little then please do donate to my

1536.46 --> 1540.98
GoFundMe so I can get that new air

1538.53 --> 1545.8799999999999
filter I will shout you out of course I

1540.98 --> 1547.6200000000001
may also at some point at some point do

1545.88 --> 1550.25
a special I don't know night owl

1547.62 --> 1552.6899999999998
dedicated to it and a marathon a

1550.25 --> 1561.36
fresh-air marathon I thought yeah it's

1552.69 --> 1563.49
you know it's even kind of fitting so

1561.36 --> 1567.6599999999999
anyway yeah I haven't gotten anything

1563.49 --> 1573.21
just yet but I hope that some

1567.66 --> 1576.95
terminators will start to roll in anyway

1573.21 --> 1576.95
let's get on with the show

1588.119 --> 1594.1
sir Chico that's a difficult question

1592.049 --> 1596.649
because I'm still in the middle of

1594.1 --> 1600.129
transforming and this might take a long

1596.649 --> 1602.4399999999998
time it's just when you first when

1600.129 --> 1606.129
something something is unleashed like

1602.44 --> 1606.759
that it's just like another dimension is

1606.129 --> 1611.259
open

1606.759 --> 1614.08
that's just so fast that yeah I still

1611.259 --> 1616.029
have to reintegrate everything but I'm

1614.08 --> 1619.859
already noticing the difference in the

1616.029 --> 1623.169
sense that I'm I'm like very

1619.859 --> 1626.559
aggressively dropping my fear because

1623.169 --> 1633.8200000000002
might be surprised how much fear eyes I

1626.559 --> 1637.869
have kind of had since kid and even when

1633.82 --> 1640.149
I do this even though I'm not like for

1637.869 --> 1641.789
example afraid of the ballers or that

1640.149 --> 1644.4399999999998
kind of nonsense I'm not afraid of

1641.789 --> 1646.389
stupid arguments or all that I'm not

1644.44 --> 1648.8790000000001
afraid of being embarrassed those things

1646.389 --> 1653.1689999999999
I'm not afraid of no I mean for afraid

1648.879 --> 1656.35
of crazy grand scheme things that's what

1653.169 --> 1658.3590000000002
I'm afraid of especially those that are

1656.35 --> 1659.1999999999998
not apparent because if everybody's

1658.359 --> 1661.359
talking about it

1659.2 --> 1663.8500000000001
it's very unlikely you should be afraid

1661.359 --> 1670.889
of it but if nobody's talking about it

1663.85 --> 1673.4189999999999
then then things may be risky it's but I

1670.889 --> 1677.4089999999999
can't properly explain it it could

1673.419 --> 1682.21
simply be that I was born with a streak

1677.409 --> 1684.5800000000002
of paranoia and that my personal social

1682.21 --> 1690.3990000000001
interactions with other people at a

1684.58 --> 1693.6
young age have fed into that a lot like

1690.399 --> 1697.779
the the mercilessness of some people

1693.6 --> 1701.1899999999998
towards me as I was a little kid I can

1697.779 --> 1707.98
safely say that has really damaged me

1701.19 --> 1710.259
not because of it but because of the

1707.98 --> 1712.57
harsh realization that the world works

1710.259 --> 1717.129
like that and that I feel that I'm

1712.57 --> 1720.25
[ __ ] because of it because my personal

1717.129 --> 1723.6689999999999
approach as since I was with a since I

1720.25 --> 1728.11
opened my eyes was always openness and

1723.669 --> 1730.8400000000001
directs always do that because I am

1728.11 --> 1733.6899999999998
assuming that everybody needs all the

1730.84 --> 1736.299
freaking help they can get everybody and

1733.69 --> 1739.179
if they're too stupid to realize then

1736.299 --> 1741.4
they're just gonna hurt themselves that

1739.179 --> 1743.44
is the soap that I've been born with

1741.4 --> 1748.659
that attitude okay I've been born with

1743.44 --> 1751.0800000000002
it and and it didn't work it didn't work

1748.659 --> 1754.8700000000001
in school nobody gave a [ __ ] about me

1751.08 --> 1757.4189999999999
nobody gave a [ __ ] about my my dreams

1754.87 --> 1761.1689999999999
about what I wanted no they were all

1757.419 --> 1764.47
just trying to find things to pick on me

1761.169 --> 1766.15
with it and make me feel stupid I've

1764.47 --> 1769.23
been subjected to that a lot

1766.15 --> 1771.5800000000002
now I over also overcame that by

1769.23 --> 1774.13
sometimes just having a lot of energy

1771.58 --> 1777.4289999999999
and I had like manic phases where I

1774.13 --> 1780.73
would literally start to act funny types

1777.429 --> 1783.22
I would clown around by acting like I

1780.73 --> 1785.83
was a [ __ ] but in a very very specific

1783.22 --> 1788.77
type of way that almost became its own

1785.83 --> 1792.6999999999998
subculture that actually happened once

1788.77 --> 1796.72
it actually happened I was like period

1792.7 --> 1800.679
between eight and ten and in the school

1796.72 --> 1803.3500000000001
where that was I even kind of used it to

1800.679 --> 1806.6200000000001
defy teachers in funny ways and it

1803.35 --> 1808.9599999999998
worked so well worked so insanely well

1806.62 --> 1811.0
that I even Diaz almost got a moment of

1808.96 --> 1812.89
popularity from other students that were

1811.0 --> 1814.63
trying it because they wanted to rebel

1812.89 --> 1816.49
against the teachers too because some

1814.63 --> 1820.96
teachers were just stupid

1816.49 --> 1823.69
and an authoritarian very annoying in

1820.96 --> 1825.549
some ways not perfect not like really

1823.69 --> 1828.3400000000001
autocrats but it was just annoying and

1825.549 --> 1829.9
yeah we're kids you want it to be it you

1828.34 --> 1832.8999999999999
want it to be able to stand up and

1829.9 --> 1834.94
uphold face against the teacher for

1832.9 --> 1837.4
whatever reason and I kind of started

1834.94 --> 1840.19
doing that with my silly little act and

1837.4 --> 1843.159
then other kids started to do it you it

1840.19 --> 1846.159
was really weird because it was like my

1843.159 --> 1848.6490000000001
voice my little crazy voice that me and

1846.159 --> 1850.39
my brother because my brother even

1848.649 --> 1852.8799999999999
though it was seven years older he also

1850.39 --> 1853.5700000000002
did that we did that together a lot just

1852.88 --> 1855.8100000000002
that goof

1853.57 --> 1858.34
have a lot of fun he was like one of our

1855.81 --> 1859.75
safe ways of communicating because

1858.34 --> 1861.76
otherwise we were very different

1859.75 --> 1864.07
characters it was weird

1861.76 --> 1867.04
I was weird everything in my life is

1864.07 --> 1871.45
weird but it that part was enjoyable

1867.04 --> 1874.48
about it but it was it got so weird with

1871.45 --> 1876.43
the react the silly little act of the

1874.48 --> 1879.64
cartoonish character that I would play

1876.43 --> 1881.8600000000001
even in the class and all that that

1879.64 --> 1883.8100000000002
others would start to do that and I even

1881.86 --> 1886.57
heard afterward that this one guy who

1883.81 --> 1888.94
already had kind of mental problems he

1886.57 --> 1890.9199999999998
would get like this obsessive

1888.94 --> 1892.99
personality where he would accidentally

1890.92 --> 1897.19
get obsessed with things and he

1892.99 --> 1899.77
apparently actually used that type the

1897.19 --> 1903.1000000000001
the cartoonish figure that I acted out

1899.77 --> 1907.51
he used that against his own

1903.1 --> 1909.9399999999998
psychiatrist he tried to win from them

1907.51 --> 1912.22
so he used that and everybody got really

1909.94 --> 1914.14
worried about it's like you can't do

1912.22 --> 1917.17
that anymore in school there's people

1914.14 --> 1920.47
now going nuts because of it you got to

1917.17 --> 1923.65
stop that it's like what really they're

1920.47 --> 1925.51
going insane because of me now of course

1923.65 --> 1928.1200000000001
later I realized that it wasn't really

1925.51 --> 1931.18
because of me he had the problem and it

1928.12 --> 1933.7299999999998
was just yeah the - he bumped into to

1931.18 --> 1939.96
use but it was still very odd

1933.73 --> 1945.51
realization back then goofing around

1939.96 --> 1950.74
types acting for fun for comedic relief

1945.51 --> 1953.05
also to kind of show that I it was a way

1950.74 --> 1955.95
to express mania as well to just be

1953.05 --> 1958.6299999999999
completely stupid and impulsive like

1955.95 --> 1960.73
completely stupid and impulsive you know

1958.63 --> 1964.3600000000001
people are stupid and impulsive right

1960.73 --> 1968.41
now in the world but as they are they

1964.36 --> 1970.6899999999998
still try to act sort of like like it's

1968.41 --> 1972.6100000000001
normal or right they're just being

1970.69 --> 1975.55
stupid and compulsive but I would act

1972.61 --> 1977.9499999999998
like that over emphasize to make it

1975.55 --> 1981.43
extra ridiculous and it was funny

1977.95 --> 1983.44
I acted just like a complete clown and

1981.43 --> 1985.39
it was great was very exhilarating to do

1983.44 --> 1986.49
that as it was young it was a great

1985.39 --> 1989.94
escape

1986.49 --> 1992.7
yeah I don't do that anymore just it's

1989.94 --> 1997.0700000000002
just silly anyway how do I get to that

1992.7 --> 1997.07
subject school acting like that

2010.72 --> 2016.1200000000001
right join up though yes ten years of

2013.33 --> 2019.03
everyday use is a very good for

2016.12 --> 2021.1499999999999
electronic device exactly that's my

2019.03 --> 2021.1499999999999
point

2024.23 --> 2027.319
[Music]

2027.95 --> 2033.0800000000002
now of course I you do need to maintain

2030.62 --> 2037.04
it you're doing like need to clean it

2033.08 --> 2039.05
you know they say technically is like

2037.04 --> 2042.17
advisors will do it every month or so I

2039.05 --> 2045.59
do it practically every half a year it's

2042.17 --> 2050.33
not that much work maybe half an hour at

2045.59 --> 2052.73
best so yeah it's been a great device

2050.33 --> 2055.06
and for the investment that I made back

2052.73 --> 2060.679
in the day it's paid off

2055.06 --> 2064.12
like yeah part of my lifetime probably

2060.679 --> 2064.12
got a bonus because of it

2072.839 --> 2075.919
I am in the you

2083.45 --> 2087.319
yes sir check oh I know I I go all over

2086.48 --> 2091.639
the place

2087.319 --> 2095.45
oh yeah now I remember again well how I

2091.639 --> 2100.19
came to that yeah how December 15th

2095.45 --> 2105.109
changed me right yeah again I went off a

2100.19 --> 2109.01
major major sidetrack there to move back

2105.109 --> 2110.38
in the past but yeah I've been dealing

2109.01 --> 2114.23
with fear

2110.38 --> 2117.319
situations sensitivity to that and even

2114.23 --> 2119.41
times of depression as a very young kid

2117.319 --> 2122.45
still and as a very young kid I hit it

2119.41 --> 2125.0
only my parents really really I realized

2122.45 --> 2134.839
it but they even kept to myself just the

2125.0 --> 2139.88
depths of it and like I've come to

2134.839 --> 2144.77
realize that I have to overcome it and

2139.88 --> 2148.7200000000003
not just with insight like I have to

2144.77 --> 2154.19
really overcome it and basically just

2148.72 --> 2157.6899999999996
somehow erase it really erase it so that

2154.19 --> 2160.9
I literally do not care anymore about

2157.69 --> 2164.29
any potential long-term risks of

2160.9 --> 2167.089
whatever could transpire potentially

2164.29 --> 2169.73
because yeah I have even ever since I

2167.089 --> 2174.8289999999997
started on YouTube I've been like really

2169.73 --> 2180.44
nervous as hell about the about Flat

2174.829 --> 2182.059
Earth not about oh the realization of it

2180.44 --> 2185.92
being flattered or whatever but the

2182.059 --> 2189.2000000000003
potential consequences for the long run

2185.92 --> 2191.69
because I have memories of being pretty

2189.2 --> 2195.319
severely threatened like future

2191.69 --> 2199.549
threatened like them telling me if you

2195.319 --> 2203.329
go with that you're gonna die you will

2199.549 --> 2208.849
be killed in the end that's what I

2203.329 --> 2212.78
remember and I don't really like having

2208.849 --> 2215.7200000000003
that memory and I'm wondering was it

2212.78 --> 2218.5
truly a bluff if it was a bluff why was

2215.72 --> 2221.6299999999997
it so persistent

2218.5 --> 2223.7
where does that come from like is that

2221.63 --> 2227.33
what day and I'm not talking about

2223.7 --> 2230.0299999999997
ballers I'm talking about really messed

2227.33 --> 2233.18
up people is that what they plan to do

2230.03 --> 2236.23
or is that not what they plan to do is

2233.18 --> 2240.71
that just because they hate the truth

2236.23 --> 2244.73
above all things is that why they

2240.71 --> 2247.4900000000002
threatened me because ever after since I

2244.73 --> 2252.68
basically rolled in to flatter starting

2247.49 --> 2255.41
doing this none of those people and by

2252.68 --> 2258.68
the way before that night not anyhow

2255.41 --> 2262.91
have ever actually doubled down on the

2258.68 --> 2265.7
threat with me ever who said that you

2262.91 --> 2268.8199999999997
think I'm gonna share that you think I'm

2265.7 --> 2272.68
gonna share the names who threatened my

2268.82 --> 2275.9300000000003
life over this type of subject really I

2272.68 --> 2282.29
don't think so I don't think I'm gonna

2275.93 --> 2285.1699999999996
share that I and again I don't even know

2282.29 --> 2290.81
if it really was real if they knew

2285.17 --> 2293.69
something from whatever or if it is

2290.81 --> 2299.7999999999997
literally a mythology Bluff that kept

2293.69 --> 2304.36
them out I don't know I don't know and

2299.8 --> 2307.9700000000003
therefore yeah I've got this weird

2304.36 --> 2315.6200000000003
duality in the back of my mind was that

2307.97 --> 2319.2799999999997
real was it a pure Bluff or both was it

2315.62 --> 2323.0
a bluff to them but what did they get

2319.28 --> 2326.77
that message originally from people that

2323.0 --> 2332.39
actually did mean it I don't know I

2326.77 --> 2337.43
don't know but yeah since I'm here since

2332.39 --> 2342.02
I am doing this pretty pretty far I'm

2337.43 --> 2344.27
not not even being like goo maybe for

2342.02 --> 2346.64
strategical purpose I'll not call my

2344.27 --> 2349.28
show flat earth because flat earth and

2346.64 --> 2350.33
the reactions just call it something no

2349.28 --> 2352.46
not

2350.33 --> 2356.42
of that now I am pretty damn full in

2352.46 --> 2359.81
here and I've mastered the technicals I

2356.42 --> 2361.4300000000003
pride myself to mastering the technicals

2359.81 --> 2362.75
of having oversight of the most

2361.43 --> 2364.94
important things the things that I think

2362.75 --> 2366.95
are the most important concerning the

2364.94 --> 2369.7400000000002
insight and understanding of the cosmati

2366.95 --> 2373.64
knee and the machinations of the ballers

2369.74 --> 2378.5
I pride myself for that but on the long

2373.64 --> 2384.1099999999997
run I do feel that if things get chaotic

2378.5 --> 2386.57
enough out there and that well if we

2384.11 --> 2388.9700000000003
it's not gonna be flat earthers

2386.57 --> 2396.79
exclusively but we might just be on a

2388.97 --> 2399.5899999999997
long list of to kill not just us but

2396.79 --> 2405.74
yeah again this I know this sounds a bit

2399.59 --> 2408.8900000000003
like fearful and but it is it is my fear

2405.74 --> 2411.2599999999998
in a way you know and if that kind of

2408.89 --> 2413.7799999999997
shit's gonna happen then basically even

2411.26 --> 2415.7900000000004
being a flat earther on such a list it's

2413.78 --> 2417.8300000000004
kind of trivial you know if it's a giant

2415.79 --> 2426.11
giant list with all kinds of groups and

2417.83 --> 2428.81
[ __ ] so so you could also see it as yeah

2426.11 --> 2434.36
there's this situation coming where the

2428.81 --> 2437.15
darkness cannot threat lightly anymore

2434.36 --> 2441.29
where they cannot try to mind controls

2437.15 --> 2444.53
anymore and where they will literally

2441.29 --> 2448.27
have no more choice from their

2444.53 --> 2452.8
perspective than to lash out brutally

2448.27 --> 2457.04
brutally like savagely attack people and

2452.8 --> 2460.3700000000003
not just like ooh a mob no like suddenly

2457.04 --> 2463.04
everywhere people just get start dragged

2460.37 --> 2465.62
out of houses and just get horrifically

2463.04 --> 2467.66
murdered in front of everyone and you

2465.62 --> 2474.56
don't even know who the who is doing

2467.66 --> 2476.99
that that [ __ ] that [ __ ] you don't even

2474.56 --> 2479.5
know you won't even know who's doing it

2476.99 --> 2482.8999999999996
when it happens that [ __ ]

2479.5 --> 2484.13
yeah that sounds absolutely horrific and

2482.9 --> 2491.03
it is it's terrif

2484.13 --> 2493.46
lying to me and I've seen it in visions

2491.03 --> 2498.2000000000003
they showed me that and I don't know to

2493.46 --> 2501.35
this day if this was their projected

2498.2 --> 2504.14
creation to threaten me or if it was an

2501.35 --> 2507.35
actual glimpse in the future because

2504.14 --> 2509.87
there were definitely landmark features

2507.35 --> 2513.83
that I did recognize I'd recognized

2509.87 --> 2517.31
locations from in what I see no no no

2513.83 --> 2523.2799999999997
jihad baby no jihad no there were they

2517.31 --> 2527.18
weren't Arabs no no nothing like that is

2523.28 --> 2530.6200000000003
it no it's the Pharisees all of them all

2527.18 --> 2534.29
of them together all of the Pharisees

2530.62 --> 2537.83
they lift the veil they drop the

2534.29 --> 2542.63
polarized acts and they all make their

2537.83 --> 2545.06
move all together that's what I think

2542.63 --> 2548.42
may happen and when it happens there's

2545.06 --> 2551.12
nothing anyone can do it's just accept

2548.42 --> 2559.73
defend yourself and just see what's what

2551.12 --> 2562.0099999999998
remains hmm but let's hope that never

2559.73 --> 2564.02
ever happens because it is absolutely

2562.01 --> 2566.09
horrific if such a thing would happen

2564.02 --> 2568.57
and it would literally destroy the

2566.09 --> 2572.8700000000003
entire Western culture maybe

2568.57 --> 2575.8
unrepairable so if something as insane

2572.87 --> 2575.7999999999997
as that would happen

2578.9 --> 2581.86
yeah

2583.52 --> 2590.87
Josef's 3 6 9 no I don't think so

2587.6 --> 2590.87
not really

2594.64 --> 2598.589
I think geoengineering is just

2596.619 --> 2602.1600000000003
geoengineering it may have secondary

2598.589 --> 2605.92
communication functions to enhance

2602.16 --> 2608.17
telecommunication slightly as for the 5g

2605.92 --> 2611.4900000000002
it's a separate project that can do even

2608.17 --> 2617.76
different things maybe 5g could

2611.49 --> 2619.839
aggravate flu-like symptoms could like

2617.76 --> 2621.67
some a person that would be in a

2619.839 --> 2624.91
perfectly healthy state maybe it could

2621.67 --> 2628.51
be rigged to literally give them a cold

2624.91 --> 2631.1499999999996
in a very rapid moment I don't know it

2628.51 --> 2634.599
might be possible that's really the only

2631.15 --> 2638.89
link I have as for the corona virus it's

2634.599 --> 2641.9500000000003
[ __ ] there is there is no corona

2638.89 --> 2645.73
virus as is that doesn't exist there is

2641.95 --> 2648.5789999999997
there's this flu thing that has the

2645.73 --> 2651.4
corona halo identified around it will

2648.579 --> 2654.069
guess what it's like half the flu in the

2651.4 --> 2658.119
world it's like that it's like

2654.069 --> 2660.3089999999997
everywhere so but yeah this very special

2658.119 --> 2663.4
version right the mutated version I

2660.309 --> 2667.6800000000003
don't even know if that is real at all

2663.4 --> 2672.309
like at all I have not seen any any

2667.68 --> 2675.779
direct evidence of that at all zero zero

2672.309 --> 2678.8190000000004
zero zero zero zero nothing nothing

2675.779 --> 2680.95
absolutely nothing nothing

2678.819 --> 2684.009
that convinces me in the slightest that

2680.95 --> 2688.0589999999997
there is anything like that out there in

2684.009 --> 2690.9900000000002
the open nothing the flu however yeah

2688.059 --> 2690.9900000000002
plenty of that

2693.65 --> 2701.2690000000002
so now that doesn't mean that there has

2697.92 --> 2705.029
not potentially been done some kind of

2701.269 --> 2708.859
biological experiments by creating this

2705.029 --> 2712.74
weird hybrid virus thing you know and

2708.859 --> 2715.98
who knows maybe if a hybrid virus thing

2712.74 --> 2717.8089999999997
is like multiplied and you inject that

2715.98 --> 2719.279
into somebody or you sprayed and unto

2717.809 --> 2723.509
somebody that they will get like

2719.279 --> 2727.259
insanely sick but I don't know just

2723.509 --> 2729.329
realizing that it is genetically mutated

2727.259 --> 2731.279
it is a frankenstein creation in the

2729.329 --> 2733.9500000000003
first place and then the general

2731.279 --> 2736.94
consequences of what happens when you do

2733.95 --> 2740.6699999999996
that with things with any life form is

2736.94 --> 2744.299
it dies out because it's mutated when

2740.67 --> 2749.809
it's mutated it dies out it's one plus

2744.299 --> 2749.809
one is two if it's mutated it dies out

2750.41 --> 2757.44
so who knows if there is any kind of

2753.9 --> 2764.009
release of this bizarro frankenstein

2757.44 --> 2768.059
corona virus thing but if it is I'm yeah

2764.009 --> 2771.2400000000002
I'm no I'm no medical expert officially

2768.059 --> 2773.94
but I could safely say I've 100%

2771.24 --> 2776.66
certainty that it is not doing what they

2773.94 --> 2781.529
say it is doing it is not spreading

2776.66 --> 2785.339
probably can and if it did it would just

2781.529 --> 2793.319
be drowned out by regular flu so it's

2785.339 --> 2794.7889999999998
just yeah that's what it is to me all

2793.319 --> 2798.4
right

2794.789 --> 2801.849
and yeah I'm pretty sure I'm gonna be

2798.4 --> 2804.64
marked up with another red red stripe on

2801.849 --> 2806.259
the list now because they do that with

2804.64 --> 2808.69
everything everything and that's out

2806.259 --> 2811.359
there on that everybody gets marked with

2808.69 --> 2813.279
every subject like oh you're not going

2811.359 --> 2815.049
with that okay that means you get a red

2813.279 --> 2819.609
cross you're going that okay that means

2815.049 --> 2823.989
you get a a green circle and do it with

2819.609 --> 2827.859
everything everyone and I'm pretty sure

2823.989 --> 2831.789
I got pretty much every red cross there

2827.859 --> 2834.43
is now like even the all potential

2831.789 --> 2837.329
psycho whatever because of my 82

2834.43 --> 2840.819
outbreak because of my 82 what I did

2837.329 --> 2845.8590000000004
when in full fro berserk in this spiral

2840.819 --> 2847.509
of fear basically yeah but just because

2845.859 --> 2851.589
I did that once

2847.509 --> 2853.9
I am marked I'm pretty sure they marked

2851.589 --> 2857.739
me as a potential dangerous figure and

2853.9 --> 2860.17
that can go in all directions even

2857.739 --> 2864.64
though I am NOT I am like one of the

2860.17 --> 2865.9
most peaceful pacifist neighbor friendly

2864.64 --> 2868.66
person ever

2865.9 --> 2870.599
besides yeah sometimes me having some

2868.66 --> 2874.69
emotional issues and getting a bit loud

2870.599 --> 2877.15
what I always apologize I never double

2874.69 --> 2878.949
down on aggression I never double down

2877.15 --> 2883.739
on being wrong ever

2878.949 --> 2887.44
I'd rather bash my face in the wall I

2883.739 --> 2892.209
hate that I hate people that do that so

2887.44 --> 2895.7490000000003
bad so bad I'd never catch myself doing

2892.209 --> 2897.7889999999998
that never horrific doubling down on

2895.749 --> 2900.509
being wrong and I'm being antisocial

2897.789 --> 2900.509
it's horrific

2904.5 --> 2911.619
so but I'm pretty sure I have the mark

2907.21 --> 2913.78
added on some list somewhere and yeah

2911.619 --> 2916.119
it's all a matter of when it's what's

2913.78 --> 2919.2400000000002
gonna be done with it doesn't even

2916.119 --> 2921.549
matter or is this only for their high

2919.24 --> 2922.0
tier programs like if you want the big

2921.549 --> 2924.28
bucks

2922.0 --> 2926.71
then you gotta have all the the green

2924.28 --> 2929.2900000000004
circles you can't have any red marks is

2926.71 --> 2931.809
it like that is it only for that or is

2929.29 --> 2936.19
there so a long term purpose for these

2931.809 --> 2938.049
marks for some potential endgame kill

2936.19 --> 2942.099
lists like okay these are the people

2938.049 --> 2945.069
we're gonna remove - yeah to fulfill the

2942.099 --> 2950.53
depopulation goal is it like that I

2945.069 --> 2952.5099999999998
don't know I don't know but yeah at

2950.53 --> 2954.15
times this [ __ ] really does make me

2952.51 --> 2957.5200000000004
nervous

2954.15 --> 2960.309
but I will I will not just straight out

2957.52 --> 2964.569
declare that that is true that that is

2960.309 --> 2967.2900000000004
gonna happen without carefully giving

2964.569 --> 2969.46
you the origins of my suspicions and

2967.29 --> 2971.98
like where is this coming from

2969.46 --> 2973.569
what could it really be how serious do

2971.98 --> 2975.67
we need to take it and what are the

2973.569 --> 2981.97
consequences of taking it serious and of

2975.67 --> 2987.099
not taking it serious so yeah I try not

2981.97 --> 2989.2
to be about Fairport so although on the

2987.099 --> 2991.27
other hand it seems that people don't

2989.2 --> 2993.2799999999997
really care what I'm talking about since

2991.27 --> 2995.5
they're talking about helium and pigeons

2993.28 --> 2999.1600000000003
farts and all that nonsense even though

2995.5 --> 3002.79
I'm talking about yeah future survival

2999.16 --> 3004.5589999999997
of the entire Flat Earth scene and I

3002.79 --> 3006.75
guess nobody gives a [ __ ] about that

3004.559 --> 3011.75
right because you're all happy to talk

3006.75 --> 3011.75
about nonsense in my chat back and forth

3023.539 --> 3031.559
yeah our future survival in that

3027.809 --> 3034.049
worst-case scenario which may come when

3031.559 --> 3036.2400000000002
they say yeah it's really nice it's

3034.049 --> 3038.13
really nice that you want every single

3036.24 --> 3041.0989999999997
argument that you have mastered all

3038.13 --> 3043.589
these things of knowledge and now we're

3041.099 --> 3045.96
done with it because we need to build

3043.589 --> 3051.869
more dreams to continue our government

3045.96 --> 3055.23
so it's time for you all to go that do

3051.869 --> 3067.44
you realize the dangers of actually

3055.23 --> 3069.869
winning do you realize do you realize

3067.44 --> 3073.89
the consequences and the dangers of

3069.869 --> 3076.23
actually winning actually winning the

3073.89 --> 3079.67
truth actually being right do you

3076.23 --> 3082.92
realize what could happen with all this

3079.67 --> 3085.589
I'm not talking about how general public

3082.92 --> 3089.46
responds now I'm talking about people

3085.589 --> 3093.77
that wield maniacal amounts of power

3089.46 --> 3093.77
do you realize what could happen

3110.809 --> 3118.619
yes sure well I hope you're right Ali B

3113.939 --> 3120.8689999999997
I sure hope you're right and not only

3118.619 --> 3123.539
that I hope you're right and that at the

3120.869 --> 3127.739
same time I will be able to completely

3123.539 --> 3129.809
let this idea go forever because I've

3127.739 --> 3133.789
also realized that even if it's gonna

3129.809 --> 3138.449
happen there's absolutely nothing

3133.789 --> 3140.6400000000003
nothing could ever do to stop it it's

3138.449 --> 3141.899
nothing nothing I can do it's gonna

3140.64 --> 3146.0389999999998
happen it's going to happen and it's

3141.899 --> 3148.259
better that I just fall in puttin all my

3146.039 --> 3151.259
power every little bit I have every

3148.259 --> 3155.669
little wisdom I have and just shock the

3151.259 --> 3159.419
world into this crazy ascension in the

3155.669 --> 3161.969
hopes that it'll simply make such a

3159.419 --> 3166.199
final solution against the truth

3161.969 --> 3169.429
impossible because just because the

3166.199 --> 3175.079
truth suddenly is in books everywhere

3169.429 --> 3179.13
that's not the end the liars are still

3175.079 --> 3182.579
there they're still they're still going

3179.13 --> 3187.619
to be scheming they still want the truth

3182.579 --> 3191.099
to go away again that's never gonna end

3187.619 --> 3193.88
you do realize that right people it's

3191.099 --> 3198.469
never gonna end ever

3193.88 --> 3198.469
not as long as humans live

3209.93 --> 3213.6
[Music]

3214.92 --> 3222.55
join a gun club great yeah that would be

3220.09 --> 3225.28
just brilliant that's great especially

3222.55 --> 3227.77
in my case right now in the Netherlands

3225.28 --> 3231.13
that's just fantastic I'll have this

3227.77 --> 3233.5
giant flag on my back this guy knows how

3231.13 --> 3237.55
to handle guns if you're gonna take him

3233.5 --> 3238.69
down make sure to be armed yeah it's a

3237.55 --> 3242.98
great idea man

3238.69 --> 3248.56
fantastic fantastic protect my home

3242.98 --> 3250.84
because because what because if I'm

3248.56 --> 3254.74
gonna protect my home they can take me

3250.84 --> 3256.9
down with bigger guns think so no no I

3254.74 --> 3259.6
think I'm fine the way I am because I

3256.9 --> 3264.1600000000003
have a bow but a bow isn't really that

3259.6 --> 3267.22
dangerous but yeah people that may think

3264.16 --> 3269.08
they can handle me they might be

3267.22 --> 3272.1699999999996
surprised by that I think that's a

3269.08 --> 3274.47
little bit more valuable than just I'm

3272.17 --> 3277.63
gonna get a bazooka right now I'm gonna

3274.47 --> 3279.7
freaking war in the Netherlands I'm

3277.63 --> 3281.98
gonna get himself bazooka and machine

3279.7 --> 3284.29
gun and get all the permissions I want

3281.98 --> 3288.94
my own shooting range in the Midlands

3284.29 --> 3292.0
yeah what's gonna happen yeah everybody

3288.94 --> 3294.52
is going to know I'm freaky arms and if

3292.0 --> 3297.34
they felt like I really needed to get

3294.52 --> 3299.64
out of the way they just sent a lot more

3297.34 --> 3299.6400000000003
guns

3306.9 --> 3315.9700000000003
maybe maybe Jeffrey bail you know I you

3313.54 --> 3320.44
know that I actually would prefer that

3315.97 --> 3324.2799999999997
in some way somehow I don't know how it

3320.44 --> 3326.11
would be possible from this moment in

3324.28 --> 3328.4500000000003
time how we could get there but I've

3326.11 --> 3335.17
been trying to think about it for a long

3328.45 --> 3338.6499999999996
long time how do we get the rights to

3335.17 --> 3342.13
arm ourselves in for self-defense

3338.65 --> 3347.4100000000003
purposes like the right to own a gun in

3342.13 --> 3352.6
a house how do we get that back because

3347.41 --> 3356.2
that that would have huge impact

3352.6 --> 3358.06
huge it will have a cultural shock wave

3356.2 --> 3360.37
of course with all the labor alls the

3358.06 --> 3363.06
law go nutso [ __ ] their pants on a

3360.37 --> 3369.27
daily basis for the first for a few

3363.06 --> 3373.2999999999997
years probably but could we somehow get

3369.27 --> 3375.4
this trust back this fear poor nonsense

3373.3 --> 3377.98
concerning self-defense could we get it

3375.4 --> 3380.14
back is that possible in the Netherlands

3377.98 --> 3384.01
is that possible in Germany and in

3380.14 --> 3388.0299999999997
Europe in England because I think that

3384.01 --> 3390.9700000000003
would help a lot and yeah look a gun

3388.03 --> 3393.4300000000003
club is all very nice yeah you could go

3390.97 --> 3397.39
to a gun club you could shoot your thing

3393.43 --> 3399.19
and if you're manly talk whatever talk

3397.39 --> 3401.23
about self-defense talk about the

3399.19 --> 3405.31
technicals yeah sure that's it's cool I

3401.23 --> 3409.9
get it but that does not give you

3405.31 --> 3411.31
self-defense at all because just because

3409.9 --> 3412.84
you joined the gun club doesn't mean

3411.31 --> 3415.0
that you certainly get permission to

3412.84 --> 3416.83
have a gun at home that you can use for

3415.0 --> 3419.11
self-defense without literally being

3416.83 --> 3421.54
arrested for murder once you use it in

3419.11 --> 3423.81
self-defense you know because that's the

3421.54 --> 3426.25
situation right now

3423.81 --> 3431.35
it's

3426.25 --> 3437.13
what what use is a gun if yeah if you

3431.35 --> 3437.13
you can't use it at all for self-defense

3439.92 --> 3448.23
anyway that's my idea it's extremely

3446.29 --> 3451.96
unpopular in the Netherlands I think

3448.23 --> 3454.48
like fast fast majority is yeah

3451.96 --> 3456.88
everybody hates guns the fast majority

3454.48 --> 3457.66
just hates guns even those that would

3456.88 --> 3460.27
think yeah

3457.66 --> 3470.95
self-defense is kind of cool they still

3460.27 --> 3473.29
hate guns you know all right Jeffrey

3470.95 --> 3475.2999999999997
bill well I bet in Germany there's more

3473.29 --> 3481.39
of them there so yeah in Germany there's

3475.3 --> 3483.79
a lot more space you know because a gun

3481.39 --> 3487.15
club for example in the city is not too

3483.79 --> 3490.0299999999997
preferable you'd need like this noise

3487.15 --> 3492.64
isolated basically a bunker in which you

3490.03 --> 3493.8300000000004
can shoot to do that but in Germany yeah

3492.64 --> 3496.87
there's more out in the open

3493.83 --> 3500.37
possibilities with that because there's

3496.87 --> 3500.37
a lot of forest around still

3509.51 --> 3517.3100000000004
you weren't even sure how man yeah well

3515.09 --> 3520.27
there were always was a lot of room in

3517.31 --> 3520.27
Germany

3527.27 --> 3531.19
yeah underground rages right

3533.4 --> 3539.84
anyway yeah anyway I thought about at

3536.94 --> 3542.85
least trying it out sometimes you know

3539.84 --> 3545.4900000000002
on the other hand I guess for me it

3542.85 --> 3549.21
would be more fun to just learn how to

3545.49 --> 3552.3599999999997
use my bow better I can use it but to

3549.21 --> 3557.67
really get good at it because it never

3552.36 --> 3560.33
really took that much effort spend a lot

3557.67 --> 3563.7000000000003
more time on my verbal skills you know

3560.33 --> 3567.0299999999997
I've gotten myself out of pretty

3563.7 --> 3569.46
potentially dangerous situation where I

3567.03 --> 3573.6600000000003
could get bashed up by a group of people

3569.46 --> 3576.15
with my words many many more times than

3573.66 --> 3581.1499999999996
I've ever been able to with any kinds of

3576.15 --> 3581.15
form of violence or threatening ever so

3590.14 --> 3595.72
like even in the face of like a group of

3593.2 --> 3598.4199999999996
guys or something that we're really

3595.72 --> 3604.45
looking out for to get in a fight you

3598.42 --> 3607.96
know I would get out of that who wants

3604.45 --> 3609.16
to hurt me well plenty of people well

3607.96 --> 3612.19
not not food

3609.16 --> 3614.74
no not like not personally but you know

3612.19 --> 3616.9900000000002
sometimes when you walk in the city or

3614.74 --> 3621.64
whatever they could be just groups kids

3616.99 --> 3623.2599999999998
or yeah like in the 20s 30s they could

3621.64 --> 3627.7889999999998
just be looking out for trouble they're

3623.26 --> 3634.9300000000003
like who we want to we want a little get

3627.789 --> 3639.8190000000004
a little rough you know that happens now

3634.93 --> 3641.74
not me personally no and that's the

3639.819 --> 3644.049
whole thing if somebody does think that

3641.74 --> 3646.0589999999997
then they'll have a good talk with me

3644.049 --> 3649.2889999999998
and then no I'll get them to realize

3646.059 --> 3652.059
that I'm not their enemy that they'd

3649.289 --> 3655.92
they'd have much more advantage of me

3652.059 --> 3659.849
just are there as leaving he alone or or

3655.92 --> 3659.849
being friendly with me

3662.91 --> 3670.1789999999996
[Music]
