so yeah starting a little late today

113.64 --> 116.36
uh

117.42 --> 122.119
yeah the weather today is

124.02 --> 129.35999999999999
well right now there's a cloud overhead

126.24 --> 130.679
but overall it's like it's been very

129.36 --> 133.56
warm

130.679 --> 136.02
it's almost completely wind still

133.56 --> 138.84
and it's just really warm a bit moist

136.02 --> 141.54000000000002
too and you can even see that like in

138.84 --> 142.5
the clear spots that it's a much lighter

141.54 --> 143.879
blue

142.5 --> 147.86
there's a lot of moist in here and

143.879 --> 147.85999999999999
there's a bee here inside and flying

150.72 --> 156.42
but yeah it's it's so warm that actually

153.3 --> 159.42000000000002
a cloud overhead is

156.42 --> 161.76
not that unwelcome

159.42 --> 163.55999999999997
although I'd I'd like to get the sun

161.76 --> 168.319
back as well

163.56 --> 168.31900000000002
but it feels it's a really warm day

169.26 --> 175.879
even compared to the last week

172.62 --> 175.879
this bee is really

176.879 --> 180.56
kind of desperate to get out

181.8 --> 187.44
wait let me help him

184.65 --> 189.659
[Music]

187.44 --> 192.379
hold on guys

189.659 --> 192.379
uh

200.819 --> 203.35999999999999
come on

207.72 --> 210.799
get on it

219.299 --> 222.31900000000002
sure come on

233.099 --> 243.54
okay right

235.23 --> 246.98
[Music]

243.54 --> 246.98
that took me long enough

247.14 --> 252.42
so

249.299 --> 254.939
kind of a clumsy start today overall

252.42 --> 257.4
anyway it's

254.939 --> 259.919
4 20.

257.4 --> 261.67999999999995
2021.

259.919 --> 266.15999999999997
so

261.68 --> 271.74
and it is Tuesday that's correct

266.16 --> 275.0
so dirt 306 first in chat Michael Khan

271.74 --> 275.0
good to see you both

279.66 --> 285.96000000000004
right a bit distracted uh yeah I don't

284.22 --> 288.90000000000003
have green tea with me because I already

285.96 --> 294.71999999999997
know new like this is way too warm for

288.9 --> 297.9
tea but I got a special Gusto drink

294.72 --> 299.90000000000003
is it just a little treat

297.9 --> 299.9
um

309.6 --> 313.44
Pete's 420

312.06 --> 316.979
no

313.44 --> 320.479
no it's just 4 20.

316.979 --> 320.479
it's 4 20 every year

321.0 --> 326.3
you know what 420 is right come on Terry

323.4 --> 326.29999999999995
306.

343.32 --> 348.78
right

345.36 --> 351.41900000000004
it's cannabis day that's pretty much it

348.78 --> 353.52
I am sick and weak now do you think I

351.419 --> 355.919
got covered

353.52 --> 357.479
well that depends on how you're gonna

355.919 --> 359.88
approach it

357.479 --> 362.75899999999996
you you could have covet condition

359.88 --> 366.24
turret

362.759 --> 369.86
doesn't mean you have a virus though

366.24 --> 369.86
just means your body is

370.199 --> 373.94
well cleaning house

374.16 --> 379.16
anyway yeah I hope it's not too serious

379.259 --> 381.44
foreign

388.4 --> 393.479
let's get the notes

391.319 --> 396.38
ah all right this should have made more

393.479 --> 396.38
elaborate notes

397.919 --> 402.35999999999996
so they may be weather changes right

399.66 --> 405.36
well that could do it

402.36 --> 408.539
especially uh rigorous uh pressure

405.36 --> 412.46000000000004
changes like temperature changes can

408.539 --> 412.46
also bring pressure changes

412.8 --> 417.84000000000003
and depending on like how rapid the

415.62 --> 420.96
transition from one temperature to

417.84 --> 423.9
another is like that can typically

420.96 --> 426.96
cause you to get sick that's with me

423.9 --> 429.84
what typically causes me to get sick

426.96 --> 432.919
especially if I'm like not dressed it's

429.84 --> 436.73999999999995
like if you expect it to be really warm

432.919 --> 438.96
you're pretty yeah you'd don't have much

436.74 --> 442.5
clothing on maybe just a t-shirt or

438.96 --> 445.13899999999995
something and shorts and then yeah

442.5 --> 447.539
suddenly it gets cold and it rains and

445.139 --> 449.94
the rain is cold and then you it really

447.539 --> 452.15999999999997
doesn't warm up in order for you to dry

449.94 --> 454.44
off properly that'll typically get you

452.16 --> 457.46000000000004
into that condition that'll probably get

454.44 --> 457.46
anyone in that condition

457.5 --> 460.4
uh

461.94 --> 466.86
hello Nathan r

464.4 --> 469.02
covet is fake that means Millions have

466.86 --> 471.06
been misdiagnosed well

469.02 --> 473.58
it yeah

471.06 --> 475.56
if it's going to be diagnosed as some

473.58 --> 479.639
kind of viral infection

475.56 --> 481.259
thing then it's a misdiagnosis but yeah

479.639 --> 483.24
if you just say okay you have this

481.259 --> 486.599
percentage of viruses in you and these

483.24 --> 489.479
are the symptoms well that is true right

486.599 --> 493.819
it just doesn't imply

489.479 --> 493.81899999999996
what is averagely said about it

494.639 --> 500.58
right anyway

497.639 --> 503.46000000000004
like uh George Sanford

500.58 --> 506.46
Amanda Jung good to see you

503.46 --> 506.46
chapinator

515.94 --> 521.8800000000001
right but yeah look

519.479 --> 523.44
it doesn't really matter even to a

521.88 --> 525.959
person what they well might have

523.44 --> 528.72
psychosomatic influences but it doesn't

525.959 --> 530.399
really matter even how you regard that

528.72 --> 532.5
condition

530.399 --> 535.26
it's been said that if you have that

532.5 --> 537.54
condition that hydroxychloroquine

535.26 --> 539.459
works really well to recover from that

537.54 --> 541.5
right so

539.459 --> 544.4399999999999
that doesn't even address what the

541.5 --> 546.24
nature of it is it's just pragmatic

544.44 --> 548.94
so

546.24 --> 552.0
yeah and hydroxychloroquine as far as I

548.94 --> 556.2
know is not expensive

552.0 --> 558.48
it's even yeah well you know that it's

556.2 --> 560.1
kind of been spread around as as a thing

558.48 --> 563.64
that could work against it even

560.1 --> 566.339
mainstream so you could try that if you

563.64 --> 569.16
think like that you might suffer under

566.339 --> 571.9200000000001
it like if you got it really bad

569.16 --> 575.88
and you feel like oh this could lead to

571.92 --> 578.279
risky situations or for some or whatever

575.88 --> 581.279
reason you might just try

578.279 --> 581.279
hydroxychloroquine

582.24 --> 586.6800000000001
said that it works against the condition

585.18 --> 591.5999999999999
so

586.68 --> 594.2399999999999
right and it's also been how that works

591.6 --> 596.339
is also back because from what I

594.24 --> 598.6800000000001
gathered what it mostly does is like

596.339 --> 601.399
really

598.68 --> 601.399
uh

602.459 --> 609.1199999999999
it really micro delivers zinc

606.42 --> 611.6999999999999
which is said to be one of the things

609.12 --> 614.399
that help well against the covet

611.7 --> 616.9200000000001
condition just like D3

614.399 --> 622.38
D3 and zinc

616.92 --> 624.7199999999999
so yeah and vitamin C universally is

622.38 --> 627.36
always good Georgetown for that's true

624.72 --> 629.279
you know but that's pretty much with any

627.36 --> 634.14
kind of sickness condition

629.279 --> 637.1
like whatever it is always try vitamin C

634.14 --> 637.1
is pretty much always

641.1 --> 646.98
overall metabolic

643.44 --> 649.5600000000001
and Immunity support right and you can't

646.98 --> 651.839
really overdose on it either or cause

649.56 --> 656.2199999999999
some kind of negative side effects

651.839 --> 659.12
so yeah vitamin C always helps

656.22 --> 659.12
uh

665.16 --> 670.3389999999999
go to the doctor they will say I have

667.44 --> 670.339
code all right

670.62 --> 675.0
look it also depends on what kind of dog

673.62 --> 677.7
do you have and what kind of

675.0 --> 680.339
relationship you have with the doctor oh

677.7 --> 682.6800000000001
well you know them

680.339 --> 685.2
because if you're very superficial with

682.68 --> 687.4799999999999
your doctor yeah they'll probably try to

685.2 --> 689.88
pin covet on you

687.48 --> 692.04
but if you know them well and you know

689.88 --> 693.6
they know the whole thing is fishy and

692.04 --> 696.18
you have doubts and that they accept

693.6 --> 697.62
those doubts then

696.18 --> 700.8199999999999
well then

697.62 --> 704.24
you might just ask them hey you got

700.82 --> 704.24
hydroxychloroquinesis or something

705.24 --> 711.32
right so it all depends on your

707.88 --> 711.32
relationship with your doctor

713.88 --> 715.98
hello

714.55 --> 719.459
[Music]

715.98 --> 722.16
hello calm down police state going on in

719.459 --> 725.18
Ontario okay

722.16 --> 725.18
I guess so

729.48 --> 734.279
right anyway Terror 306 yeah drinking

732.18 --> 735.0
lemon juice they'll probably do some

734.279 --> 737.279
good

735.0 --> 739.459
I would personally add a little honey to

737.279 --> 739.459
that

741.72 --> 747.3000000000001
or yeah it is ridiculous and the only

745.079 --> 751.4399999999999
thing they're effectively doing is just

747.3 --> 754.92
Gathering genetic material right for for

751.44 --> 757.519
further down the line experiments

754.92 --> 757.519
right

760.019 --> 766.5600000000001
that's that is what it's really for it's

763.019 --> 770.1
material gathering for the next steps

766.56 --> 774.0
the next line of vaccines will be

770.1 --> 776.339
like they could be personalized

774.0 --> 778.68
they could be personalized to more

776.339 --> 780.6
effectively genetically manipulate you

778.68 --> 784.1999999999999
because they have your material in order

780.6 --> 786.66
to pre-test that right sounds super dark

784.2 --> 788.4590000000001
but that is effectively what it is

786.66 --> 791.0
that's why I'm never gonna get a test

788.459 --> 791.0
ever

796.459 --> 801.42
cleaning is a natural form of hydroxy

798.899 --> 803.6
clear okay cool nice and R I didn't know

801.42 --> 803.5999999999999
that

808.7 --> 815.0
approved vaccination who gives a [ __ ] if

812.1 --> 815.0
they approve it

815.94 --> 822.6800000000001
I don't care

818.7 --> 822.6800000000001
who cares if they approve it

829.24 --> 832.199
[Music]

830.76 --> 835.68
just

832.199 --> 839.06
just don't do it under any circumstance

835.68 --> 839.06
any circumstance

839.279 --> 842.54
right uh

845.579 --> 848.699
right anyway yeah I hope you'll recover

847.56 --> 852.1199999999999
quick

848.699 --> 855.5999999999999
vitamin C will definitely help also just

852.12 --> 858.42
ensure you get good rest don't get

855.6 --> 861.5600000000001
nervous right if you're in the condition

858.42 --> 864.66
it's advisable if you take it easy

861.56 --> 867.8389999999999
especially when it just starts out

864.66 --> 870.3
take it easy don't get yourself worked

867.839 --> 872.5400000000001
up don't go like on the internet and

870.3 --> 876.24
seek extreme things as a distraction

872.54 --> 878.519
like really take it easy

876.24 --> 882.3
that's what I advise so that you really

878.519 --> 885.42
rest so you don't get any histamines

882.3 --> 888.54
through your body from stress even if

885.42 --> 891.06
yeah it find that if you're used to that

888.54 --> 894.26
try to cut it down

891.06 --> 894.26
that's my advice

896.459 --> 903.42
right the same reason why when it wasn't

899.94 --> 906.6
taken as well as like some kind of virus

903.42 --> 909.26
nonsense if you're if you have a job and

906.6 --> 911.1
you get sick don't just continue

909.26 --> 915.12
[Music]

911.1 --> 918.24
working with it why especially well it

915.12 --> 921.0
depends well mostly most work you you'll

918.24 --> 923.519
have to be stressing in some way but it

921.0 --> 926.279
is because of that that if you just keep

923.519 --> 928.5
going you could do that it just takes a

926.279 --> 931.32
longer time for you to recover

928.5 --> 935.839
right that's why the taking it easy part

931.32 --> 935.839
is really important to recovering

936.66 --> 943.3199999999999
right when I was sick last year in

939.24 --> 945.6
October I was really really sick like I

943.32 --> 947.5790000000001
had to do that too

945.6 --> 951.5
but it was so urgent that I just

947.579 --> 951.5
instinctively felt it felt it

952.019 --> 955.579
like stay away from

956.06 --> 959.3599999999999
anxiety-inducing things

961.56 --> 966.2399999999999
right chapinator

964.139 --> 968.699
indeed

966.24 --> 972.24
good

968.699 --> 976.639
just yeah anyway I hope you'll recover

972.24 --> 976.639
soon Tarot keep us updated

987.6 --> 993.9200000000001
all right so how is everybody else doing

990.959 --> 993.92
hey what's that

994.38 --> 1003.04
hey did you just post a video George

997.8 --> 1003.04
Sanford jet fuel hoax energy suppression

1004.94 --> 1011.0600000000001
I just I went over my doctor okay well

1007.94 --> 1013.82
that's up to you right

1011.06 --> 1016.16
I am not a

1013.82 --> 1018.74
what is it

1016.16 --> 1020.6
I'm not a certified medical doctor just

1018.74 --> 1022.16
so you know Nathan r

1020.6 --> 1024.439
so

1022.16 --> 1027.439
you can't really use me as a reference

1024.439 --> 1030.679
you can only use me as a compass

1027.439 --> 1032.9
right what you're going to have to take

1030.679 --> 1034.16
responsibility for your own health in

1032.9 --> 1036.76
the end

1034.16 --> 1036.76
right

1042.319 --> 1047.6599999999999
right when I started up this channel I

1046.039 --> 1050.6
did that a lot just always like

1047.66 --> 1052.88
defaulting like okay I'm not a medical

1050.6 --> 1054.4399999999998
doctor but this and that like I don't

1052.88 --> 1056.8600000000001
even do that anymore I just don't give a

1054.44 --> 1060.38
[ __ ] right but if somebody just

1056.86 --> 1063.559
literally says it to me like that

1060.38 --> 1065.72
then I have to make mention like do keep

1063.559 --> 1067.28
in mind I'm not a certified medical

1065.72 --> 1069.88
doctor

1067.28 --> 1069.8799999999999
right

1070.64 --> 1077.179
because societally that does matter

1075.2 --> 1080.0
now spiritually

1077.179 --> 1083.539
and for your personal development that

1080.0 --> 1085.7
paper might not mean anything

1083.539 --> 1088.1
but societally it does and it's good to

1085.7 --> 1090.4
keep that in mind

1088.1 --> 1090.3999999999999
right

1095.419 --> 1100.94
not slave by no media okay

1098.72 --> 1103.299
anyway I noticed that pop-up Jared

1100.94 --> 1103.299
Sanford

1104.299 --> 1108.32
I'm gonna

1105.44 --> 1110.679
quickly take a glance it's a 15 minute

1108.32 --> 1110.6789999999999
video

1111.86 --> 1114.9399999999998
that's a repost

1124.52 --> 1127.179
hmm

1127.34 --> 1131.24
okay that that does look like a very

1129.62 --> 1133.52
interesting video with a lot of

1131.24 --> 1135.98
mechanical details in it

1133.52 --> 1138.1399999999999
all right so yeah I'll probably have a

1135.98 --> 1140.6200000000001
watch somewhere

1138.14 --> 1140.6200000000001
today

1141.58 --> 1146.74
a Neil Constantino

1143.84 --> 1146.74
good to see you

1150.26 --> 1153.26
ah

1159.74 --> 1162.58
wow

1168.38 --> 1171.5800000000002
so yeah yesterday

1172.88 --> 1179.0
decent enough early bird show

1176.9 --> 1182.0590000000002
flatters debate was also interesting

1179.0 --> 1183.799
although I was barely a part of it

1182.059 --> 1184.76
I think I got more active in the after

1183.799 --> 1187.28
show

1184.76 --> 1189.08
but there was a lot of trolling again I

1187.28 --> 1194.26
think

1189.08 --> 1194.26
was it was it Ed again the other guy

1196.52 --> 1202.12
right I do remember there was another

1199.48 --> 1208.039
basically a baller session

1202.12 --> 1209.6589999999999
just call him session as in therapy uh

1208.039 --> 1213.08
right

1209.659 --> 1216.5
and the rest of the day

1213.08 --> 1218.78
I watched a lot of stranger things

1216.5 --> 1222.2
basically finished up the

1218.78 --> 1225.2
the season in the night

1222.2 --> 1229.24
season three and then immediately got to

1225.2 --> 1229.24
the same conclusion as I did last time

1229.52 --> 1234.799
namely like yeah

1231.86 --> 1237.28
well I don't did everybody see it

1234.799 --> 1237.28
probably

1238.1 --> 1243.1999999999998
it's just that

1240.62 --> 1246.08
they leave you on a certain type of

1243.2 --> 1248.48
angle to this to the whole thing

1246.08 --> 1250.76
where I just immediately was like okay

1248.48 --> 1253.4
yeah no you can't kill that character

1250.76 --> 1255.86
off you just can't do that like that's

1253.4 --> 1256.7
illegal spiritually like you can't do

1255.86 --> 1258.9189999999999
that

1256.7 --> 1260.659
yeah they gave him proper respect but

1258.919 --> 1264.0800000000002
you just can't do that because then you

1260.659 --> 1266.98
literally kill off the series so my

1264.08 --> 1266.98
suggestion would be

1267.26 --> 1273.559
like okay in the next season you throw

1270.919 --> 1276.5
him in the other dimension you do the

1273.559 --> 1278.96
same thing as how the series started

1276.5 --> 1280.159
because that guy he has to survive he is

1278.96 --> 1283.1000000000001
too awesome

1280.159 --> 1286.0390000000002
and also it's just really really not

1283.1 --> 1290.24
fair to the mother right it's just

1286.039 --> 1293.36
like you can't do that it's just too too

1290.24 --> 1295.159
much right this is too demoralizing you

1293.36 --> 1296.9799999999998
can't leave it like that like it can't

1295.159 --> 1300.38
it

1296.98 --> 1302.9
if they wouldn't do this then they would

1300.38 --> 1305.5390000000002
have to throw in new characters and the

1302.9 --> 1308.98
entire Dynamic of what made this whole

1305.539 --> 1308.98
thing so great could be lost

1310.6 --> 1317.84
that's what I feel about it as a movie

1313.88 --> 1319.88
critic whatever story writer

1317.84 --> 1321.86
um story writer who look who's talking

1319.88 --> 1323.419
how many stories did I actually write

1321.86 --> 1326.12
not a lot

1323.419 --> 1328.5200000000002
but I do think a lot about it

1326.12 --> 1331.8999999999999
uh

1328.52 --> 1331.9
play that link

1332.36 --> 1338.9599999999998
you mean George Sanford

1336.38 --> 1340.88
when is the new season I don't know

1338.96 --> 1344.98
I don't know if they're even gonna have

1340.88 --> 1344.98
a new season haven't heard of it

1354.08 --> 1360.6789999999999
oh damn it uh

1358.46 --> 1363.52
right I'll post the link to George

1360.679 --> 1363.52
Sanford's video

1374.539 --> 1380.059
oh yeah Neil casitino tense fans pissing

1377.179 --> 1381.74
you off or welcome to the club Neil 10th

1380.059 --> 1384.74
man's been pissing a lot of people off

1381.74 --> 1384.74
ah

1387.32 --> 1392.6
I I find tense men very annoying at

1390.559 --> 1395.6589999999999
times and you know what

1392.6 --> 1399.62
the most telling thing about that is

1395.659 --> 1404.0200000000002
that he doesn't care at all like really

1399.62 --> 1404.02
he picks up on it but he doesn't care

1404.24 --> 1409.28
he just wants to do his thing and that

1407.059 --> 1412.34
there are certain individuals that have

1409.28 --> 1414.5
been quite annoyed by that but hey he's

1412.34 --> 1416.6
a he's an okay guy you know sometimes

1414.5 --> 1419.08
he's just really annoying and his puns

1416.6 --> 1422.299
are kind of lame and other times

1419.08 --> 1425.299
he actually provides some extra

1422.299 --> 1429.2
chemistry support so like social

1425.299 --> 1431.299
chemistry so whatever

1429.2 --> 1435.1000000000001
kind of self-righteous

1431.299 --> 1435.1
you mean old and stubborn

1437.419 --> 1441.8600000000001
we've bumped heads plenty of times and

1440.0 --> 1445.1
got pretty serious

1441.86 --> 1448.1589999999999
never public is always after

1445.1 --> 1451.12
right but we've had our falling out

1448.159 --> 1451.1200000000001
situations

1455.059 --> 1457.6589999999999
anyway

1459.2 --> 1465.02
the link you put in chat

1462.32 --> 1469.3999999999999
I don't what link you put in chat

1465.02 --> 1473.26
I don't see any link you put in chat hm

1469.4 --> 1473.26
and what link would that be anyway

1474.74 --> 1479.5
entire thing with oh God just

1483.32 --> 1485.6789999999999
right

1487.7 --> 1490.7
foreign

1494.779 --> 1497.779
Style

1499.34 --> 1505.82
that of Nathan and a lot of others at

1504.14 --> 1508.7
the Flat Earth debates

1505.82 --> 1511.1589999999999
are not purists

1508.7 --> 1513.38
they're only really purists when it

1511.159 --> 1515.679
comes to physics

1513.38 --> 1519.5
right all that

1515.679 --> 1521.72
mechanical purists but not really like

1519.5 --> 1523.64
how you do things and what you should

1521.72 --> 1527.5
stand up for and all that they have a

1523.64 --> 1527.5
different way of doing that so

1532.58 --> 1542.1999999999998
yeah I know it's lame I know Neil

1538.34 --> 1542.1999999999998
just leave them right

1542.96 --> 1548.8400000000001
you know where you stand

1545.539 --> 1550.82
I know where I stand and yeah there's

1548.84 --> 1552.5
nothing really more you can do

1550.82 --> 1556.34
if they're gonna

1552.5 --> 1559.64
move sideways on us then they're going

1556.34 --> 1560.72
to well not too dramatically pay the

1559.64 --> 1563.659
price for it

1560.72 --> 1565.52
right that's just the yeah when you do

1563.659 --> 1570.5200000000002
something you get the consequences of it

1565.52 --> 1570.52
so they will get back to that so

1576.74 --> 1583.059
for him to pull and he's okay well

1578.539 --> 1583.059
that's just a matter of opinion right

1585.58 --> 1592.6589999999999
don't don't get so worked up over them

1589.88 --> 1592.659
doing it

1594.5 --> 1601.58
look Neil to basically explain it from

1599.179 --> 1604.22
what I'm gathering is happening on the

1601.58 --> 1607.22
scene is this is just another scenario

1604.22 --> 1608.419
like the previous ones with Jose and

1607.22 --> 1611.539
ranty

1608.419 --> 1614.96
right what happened when ranty just

1611.539 --> 1615.98
dropped out and started to troll us what

1614.96 --> 1620.72
happened

1615.98 --> 1623.419
there were people defending him

1620.72 --> 1625.24
yeah Tony

1623.419 --> 1628.94
Nathan

1625.24 --> 1631.94
everybody was just defending him because

1628.94 --> 1633.5
that's what you do when a colleague

1631.94 --> 1636.559
turns on you

1633.5 --> 1639.32
you right

1636.559 --> 1642.9189999999999
you don't let it spark an inflame [ __ ]

1639.32 --> 1646.1589999999999
because then you get really demoralized

1642.919 --> 1648.74
so instead you kind of like make up

1646.159 --> 1651.74
excuses for them and then just slowly

1648.74 --> 1653.919
let it Drift Away

1651.74 --> 1653.919
foreign

1654.399 --> 1663.1399999999999
T hurt by it right that's what people do

1659.48 --> 1664.3990000000001
it may seem like some sort of Stockholm

1663.14 --> 1667.5800000000002
syndrome effect

1664.399 --> 1669.32
and in a indirect way it is but it

1667.58 --> 1671.539
doesn't mean that it's going to start

1669.32 --> 1675.559
and then finish that cycle

1671.539 --> 1679.039
right they're not losing their minds

1675.559 --> 1681.5
don't worry about that

1679.039 --> 1684.5
if they want to be all apologist for

1681.5 --> 1688.159
Paul that's their damn business

1684.5 --> 1689.48
for me it's done right I know I know him

1688.159 --> 1692.8990000000001
now like

1689.48 --> 1696.6200000000001
we had our suspicions me Rasta had

1692.899 --> 1699.02
especially now it's just done right he

1696.62 --> 1701.539
has like

1699.02 --> 1703.84
he's up to something he's connected to

1701.539 --> 1703.84
something

1704.26 --> 1711.32
else and

1708.26 --> 1713.299
I guess that probably something in the

1711.32 --> 1715.58
direction of her too many people

1713.299 --> 1717.26
complain about Flat Earth and how

1715.58 --> 1719.6
there's bullying going on or something

1717.26 --> 1722.539
right because those rumors are being

1719.6 --> 1725.84
spread by the Ballers and by anybody

1722.539 --> 1728.86
that doesn't like Nathan Oakley

1725.84 --> 1731.9599999999998
and yeah there's going to be a lot of

1728.86 --> 1735.559
superficial Christians

1731.96 --> 1738.8600000000001
that don't have any real oversight over

1735.559 --> 1741.44
what's out there or barely

1738.86 --> 1743.299
that are gonna pass judgment based on

1741.44 --> 1745.3990000000001
their reflection of the Bible and how

1743.299 --> 1748.22
they've been taught it so they'll get

1745.399 --> 1750.08
involved and share their opinions oh it

1748.22 --> 1752.179
must be bad because it's bullying this

1750.08 --> 1755.12
doesn't feel good right

1752.179 --> 1757.76
and then yeah some flat earthers may be

1755.12 --> 1759.86
eventually just pulled back and just

1757.76 --> 1762.32
like oh I gotta sit on the fence I think

1759.86 --> 1765.2199999999998
something like that probably happened

1762.32 --> 1765.22
with Paul

1765.919 --> 1768.88
this is weakness

1772.94 --> 1780.3400000000001
leave it just don't let them take

1776.6 --> 1780.34
something from you

1780.38 --> 1783.3400000000001
take it back

1783.44 --> 1788.779
and just realize this is what happens

1785.72 --> 1790.88
this is what always happens this these

1788.779 --> 1792.38
are things you can prevent

1790.88 --> 1795.3200000000002
ever

1792.38 --> 1797.48
always going to happen this sort of [ __ ]

1795.32 --> 1799.22
you have a group you develop you go

1797.48 --> 1803.179
through all kinds of things

1799.22 --> 1805.3990000000001
and then some people just turn

1803.179 --> 1808.299
they turn against you

1805.399 --> 1808.299
all of a sudden

1808.82 --> 1813.32
and that periodically happens when

1811.399 --> 1815.059
you're really doing something that's

1813.32 --> 1817.6399999999999
having an influence

1815.059 --> 1819.1399999999999
it's normal like they you get the

1817.64 --> 1821.8400000000001
pressure is heightened from the outside

1819.14 --> 1823.94
the amp up the pressure some people will

1821.84 --> 1826.399
Buckle directly under that pressure when

1823.94 --> 1828.38
it reaches a threshold that they can

1826.399 --> 1829.9399999999998
move Beyond

1828.38 --> 1834.74
and

1829.94 --> 1836.659
so may Simply Be seduced in some way to

1834.74 --> 1838.039
also step out of it so that's gonna

1836.659 --> 1840.6200000000001
happen and that's gonna continue

1838.039 --> 1843.32
happening it's not the last time

1840.62 --> 1844.76
new people will come in we will find

1843.32 --> 1846.74
them awesome

1844.76 --> 1849.14
they will contribute they will be

1846.74 --> 1852.26
brothers with us and then suddenly after

1849.14 --> 1855.98
a while they will turn against us this

1852.26 --> 1858.08
is going to continue happening Neil

1855.98 --> 1860.299
do you understand can I get a

1858.08 --> 1863.0
confirmation

1860.299 --> 1864.679
you have to reconcile that that is

1863.0 --> 1868.12
simply the way it's going to be and

1864.679 --> 1868.1200000000001
there's nothing you can do about it

1873.94 --> 1880.3990000000001
it's how you know

1877.82 --> 1883.0
you're doing something important that's

1880.399 --> 1883.0
how you know

1890.6 --> 1892.779

and hubbins

1937.1 --> 1941.019
we're talking about Paul Hall

1947.12 --> 1951.3799999999999
yeah well Neil that's what I think too

1949.34 --> 1953.24
right

1951.38 --> 1956.6000000000001
look

1953.24 --> 1958.7
the entire church

1956.6 --> 1962.62
system

1958.7 --> 1966.38
out there a lot of Christianity has gone

1962.62 --> 1968.6789999999999
Mega astray from its original teachings

1966.38 --> 1968.679
right

1969.44 --> 1975.919
they just went completely astray from

1972.62 --> 1978.3799999999999
the original teachings and it's more

1975.919 --> 1982.48
just like social justice Warrior

1978.38 --> 1982.48
nonsense in their own way

1982.7 --> 1989.179
and those people are allergic to any

1985.76 --> 1991.64
kind of situation socially where

1989.179 --> 1993.44
somebody gets

1991.64 --> 1996.14
spiritually hurt

1993.44 --> 1998.779
or touched

1996.14 --> 2002.5
right where things get intense

1998.779 --> 2004.96
a lot of churchians as Owen Benjamin

2002.5 --> 2007.72
would call them yeah they get

2004.96 --> 2009.94
they go and declare that the enemy like

2007.72 --> 2010.72
oh if that is happening then it can't be

2009.94 --> 2012.7
good

2010.72 --> 2015.519
right they're not gonna really read into

2012.7 --> 2018.22
the entire context

2015.519 --> 2020.799
so it's not surprising that a lot of

2018.22 --> 2023.32
churches will move against that

2020.799 --> 2026.94
like we'll manipulate people that are

2023.32 --> 2026.9399999999998
part of their group against it

2028.539 --> 2031.08
right

2034.48 --> 2040.0
so they're not they're cheap following a

2038.14 --> 2043.539
priest

2040.0 --> 2046.66
instead of being Christians following

2043.539 --> 2048.639
Christ and God

2046.66 --> 2051.46
[Music]

2048.639 --> 2053.02
the Purity the truth the decor

2051.46 --> 2055.2400000000002
Essentials

2053.02 --> 2057.839
and that's just the way it is and it's

2055.24 --> 2060.4599999999996
man's weakness and they have Justified

2057.839 --> 2063.119
excuses for it but it yeah it's not

2060.46 --> 2063.119
really helping

2070.659 --> 2075.599
from cosmology to tithing there off

2073.3 --> 2075.599
track

2076.06 --> 2078.599
okay

2079.78 --> 2085.179
well technically I don't think

2082.599 --> 2086.679
I personally don't see anything wrong

2085.179 --> 2090.339
with tithing

2086.679 --> 2095.159
it just depends on how you do it

2090.339 --> 2095.159
right you can't say You must do this

2096.159 --> 2102.339
has to be voluntary it has to be

2100.24 --> 2105.339
open and honest

2102.339 --> 2107.56
right in a way this is weird to compare

2105.339 --> 2112.359
this but in a way

2107.56 --> 2114.94
the way I get my support from you guys

2112.359 --> 2116.44
in a way I see that sort of like tithing

2114.94 --> 2119.26
but it is

2116.44 --> 2121.9
not something that that's like I yeah

2119.26 --> 2125.8590000000004
the only condition is like hey I need it

2121.9 --> 2129.839
or I can't keep doing this that's it

2125.859 --> 2129.839
right that's like an honest deal

2134.56 --> 2139.5
so yeah if you have a really inspired

2140.38 --> 2145.8
priest that's that really gets it

2145.96 --> 2151.2400000000002
yeah they need to eat and all that too

2148.96 --> 2153.099
you know and if they give everything to

2151.24 --> 2156.64
their teaching to their priesthood to

2153.099 --> 2159.579
teaching their followers yeah then they

2156.64 --> 2161.859
have a right to survive too right as

2159.579 --> 2165.76
long as they don't go for all this the

2161.859 --> 2168.0989999999997
tax evasion scams or text if it go for

2165.76 --> 2172.1800000000003
the what is it this CO3 there's all

2168.099 --> 2174.7000000000003
these tax things in the United States

2172.18 --> 2177.52
where they basically have to adapt their

2174.7 --> 2179.3799999999997
program to get extra funding well that's

2177.52 --> 2182.14
that's totally wrong

2179.38 --> 2185.619
right so if some priest would step away

2182.14 --> 2187.5989999999997
from using that to be truly free

2185.619 --> 2191.04
than they do require a little extra

2187.599 --> 2191.04
support it's that simple

2198.099 --> 2202.38
The Way Church teaches it is of right

2202.839 --> 2209.4
a lot of things the church teaches is

2206.32 --> 2209.4
off way off

2214.3 --> 2216.96
anyway

2228.04 --> 2233.98
all right yeah uh owned Benjamin

2230.619 --> 2236.6400000000003
yesterday Gary and Terry was good

2233.98 --> 2236.64
again

2237.82 --> 2241.7200000000003
[Music]

2240.22 --> 2243.8799999999997
I

2241.72 --> 2244.9599999999996
forgot yeah it didn't make any specific

2243.88 --> 2247.96
notes

2244.96 --> 2251.04
I don't remember it was just good stuff

2247.96 --> 2251.04
in general

2256.3 --> 2260.44
oh wait I remember

2257.98 --> 2262.42
yeah he was giving commentary to his own

2260.44 --> 2265.7200000000003
older work

2262.42 --> 2268.3
from like nine years ago

2265.72 --> 2271.66
and then basically criticizing himself

2268.3 --> 2274.119
like how he would judge it was really

2271.66 --> 2278.7
amusing to see that

2274.119 --> 2278.7000000000003
and yeah I thought he was being

2278.74 --> 2281.7599999999998
pretty honest

2283.42 --> 2286.92
right it was amusing

2287.38 --> 2292.78
uh right so that's it for one of my

2290.5 --> 2295.5
activities

2292.78 --> 2295.5
ah

2298.54 --> 2301.659
[Music]

2314.98 --> 2317.579
hmm

2318.22 --> 2321.24
the Boom

2333.28 --> 2342.0600000000004
will you be signing up for the rock Finn

2338.2 --> 2342.06
membership what what is that

2343.119 --> 2347.82
I don't know what that is Rufus stubbins

2376.18 --> 2380.7599999999998
can you enlighten me about it perhaps

2386.859 --> 2389.16
foreign

2389.28 --> 2396.599
for Fe content really

2392.68 --> 2396.5989999999997
so it's like a sort of YouTube

2403.54 --> 2408.66
content supporting page okay never heard

2406.3 --> 2408.6600000000003
of it

2428.68 --> 2433.02
is it rockfin or Rockin

2435.64 --> 2437.819
foreign

2454.8 --> 2460.8590000000004
Google it nothing interesting

2458.2 --> 2460.859
comes up

2465.04 --> 2469.5
for Bob from I don't think I what

2470.079 --> 2475.3
oh

2472.359 --> 2478.02
are you saying that it's his website

2475.3 --> 2478.02
endeavor

2482.44 --> 2487.56
to avoid YouTube censorship yeah yeah

2484.72 --> 2487.56
sure

2496.11 --> 2499.239
[Music]

2505.599 --> 2511.3
yo look I myself am going to probably

2508.599 --> 2513.599
have to just move on at some point at

2511.3 --> 2513.599
two

2515.319 --> 2522.88
all right because YouTube is is

2519.339 --> 2524.44
just blatantly obviously limiting my

2522.88 --> 2527.079
reach

2524.44 --> 2528.88
and well a long time ago I kind of

2527.079 --> 2530.8590000000004
settled for that

2528.88 --> 2533.1400000000003
like

2530.859 --> 2537.0989999999997
that it's the development that's my

2533.14 --> 2539.98
priority and not my reach

2537.099 --> 2542.92
because also there's just

2539.98 --> 2545.02
the bigger my reach the more people I

2542.92 --> 2547.06
will be bumping into that will totally

2545.02 --> 2550.72
not get it

2547.06 --> 2553.0
that are just gonna get in my way

2550.72 --> 2557.52
right I've always been

2553.0 --> 2557.52
more interested in gathering

2557.56 --> 2564.9
yeah focused people

2560.8 --> 2564.9
that will get what I'm doing

2565.599 --> 2572.94
add that yeah that'll be worth it

2569.619 --> 2572.94
for me to do all this

2591.04 --> 2594.04
foreign

2600.46 --> 2605.44
so we'll see where I'm gonna go maybe

2603.52 --> 2608.44
I'll go nowhere maybe everybody's gonna

2605.44 --> 2611.98
bar me because I'm the bad man

2608.44 --> 2614.02
I do something that they don't like and

2611.98 --> 2616.359
then everybody's going to just deny me

2614.02 --> 2619.38
any other platform and

2616.359 --> 2619.38
that'll be it

2619.54 --> 2624.7799999999997
then everybody out there

2621.94 --> 2627.46
on the scene will have successfully

2624.78 --> 2629.079
successfully just squished me out of

2627.46 --> 2632.339
existence

2629.079 --> 2632.3390000000004
if that's what they want

2632.5 --> 2636.579
right

2633.52 --> 2638.98
but we'll see when it comes to that

2636.579 --> 2642.599
if it comes to that and in the meantime

2638.98 --> 2642.599
I'll just be going right here

2643.3 --> 2648.7000000000003
and hopefully people will

2646.66 --> 2652.1189999999997
actually share

2648.7 --> 2656.56
this show on platforms they deem fit

2652.119 --> 2660.04
and even test it with new people

2656.56 --> 2663.7
like do you anybody in chat do you know

2660.04 --> 2666.46
anybody out there in the real world that

2663.7 --> 2669.7799999999997
you could potentially forward me to have

2666.46 --> 2669.78
you ever brought me up

2674.74 --> 2680.56
or do you rather see me as like a secret

2677.14 --> 2683.46
teacher and nobody can handle that

2680.56 --> 2683.46
I don't know

2716.68 --> 2720.359
right

2718.18 --> 2720.359
foreign

2725.619 --> 2732.359
they would laugh in my face as soon as I

2728.2 --> 2732.359
even bring a flatter at the right okay

2733.3 --> 2738.4
all right and to those people or through

2736.06 --> 2741.7599999999998
online whatever

2738.4 --> 2744.7200000000003
to those people that will not face laugh

2741.76 --> 2744.7200000000003
in your face right

2744.76 --> 2750.28
do you forward me to them do you give me

2747.88 --> 2752.319
as an option

2750.28 --> 2755.6800000000003
do you suggest me

2752.319 --> 2757.96
or I don't know maybe I'm gonna say

2755.68 --> 2759.94
something strange dude like do they

2757.96 --> 2764.14
already know about me I don't even know

2759.94 --> 2766.839
how well I am known to be out here

2764.14 --> 2768.819
I get a feeling sometimes that there's a

2766.839 --> 2770.92
lot of people in the world that know

2768.819 --> 2775.2
that I am here and that I'm doing this

2770.92 --> 2775.2000000000003
and not really all watching me

2775.3 --> 2779.26
but that my presence is kind of well

2777.7 --> 2783.2799999999997
known

2779.26 --> 2786.8190000000004
is that true can anybody support that or

2783.28 --> 2792.48
bring up

2786.819 --> 2792.48
a sized up argument against that idea

2811.54 --> 2815.099
hey Shatner's bassoon

2822.339 --> 2827.7599999999998
you showed people at work your live

2824.8 --> 2827.76
stream okay

2827.8 --> 2833.4
what did they think

2829.72 --> 2833.3999999999996
which one did you show them

2833.68 --> 2838.7799999999997
right because

2836.02 --> 2842.319
if you didn't know any better

2838.78 --> 2845.02
you just think hey this is just a guy a

2842.319 --> 2848.02
typical standard guy on YouTube doing

2845.02 --> 2851.44
his stream with the chat right if you

2848.02 --> 2854.02
didn't look at like oh Flat Earth Harry

2851.44 --> 2856.96
didn't listen pick up on any of that I

2854.02 --> 2859.3
just might be considered just another

2856.96 --> 2860.92
YouTuber

2859.3 --> 2864.3590000000004
so

2860.92 --> 2864.359
what did they think about it

2904.98 --> 2908.76
ah good stuff

2909.46 --> 2913.38
oh God just you show them

2913.48 --> 2918.52
all right you showed them that part

2916.3 --> 2920.619
and what did they think about that

2918.52 --> 2921.52
did they think I was a weirdo and a

2920.619 --> 2924.28
creep

2921.52 --> 2926.68
or did they actually feel like wow

2924.28 --> 2930.96
somebody actually has the balls to say

2926.68 --> 2930.96
it like it is what was their response

2954.94 --> 2962.16
they were scared oh God

2959.559 --> 2962.1600000000003
foreign

2973.839 --> 2979.2999999999997
why were did they say why they were

2976.18 --> 2982.24
scared or they were just universally

2979.3 --> 2985.02
shading their pants in cowardly

2982.24 --> 2985.02
what was it

3008.7 --> 3015.839
right and what were they scared of were

3011.22 --> 3017.7799999999997
they scared of me a creepy maybe the new

3015.839 --> 3022.44
Hitler

3017.78 --> 3024.42
that [ __ ] or was it like oh [ __ ] if

3022.44 --> 3027.0
anything he even says is right then

3024.42 --> 3029.16
we're all [ __ ] and like the Nazi

3027.0 --> 3030.9
Empire is already there what type of

3029.16 --> 3033.24
[ __ ] their pants were they doing

3030.9 --> 3034.8
it's kind of important to know the

3033.24 --> 3038.359
difference

3034.8 --> 3038.3590000000004
can you tell me Nathan r

3051.059 --> 3058.559
were they defensive for the Empire or

3055.319 --> 3060.96
did they suddenly feel the weight of the

3058.559 --> 3064.0400000000004
Empire which one is it this is important

3060.96 --> 3064.04
to know these things

3071.579 --> 3078.1800000000003
try and show video of irrefutable

3074.94 --> 3080.359
statement from your shows which ones are

3078.18 --> 3080.359
that

3083.7 --> 3086.48
foreign

3095.48 --> 3101.46
ER can you get back to me I just

3098.94 --> 3103.079
asked you some kind of yeah

3101.46 --> 3104.76
I asked you a couple of critical

3103.079 --> 3108.079
questions

3104.76 --> 3108.079
it's important to know

3117.72 --> 3123.7799999999997
all right yeah Aries 106.

3121.26 --> 3127.3190000000004
thank you I appreciate that you

3123.78 --> 3130.5
appreciate when I do that

3127.319 --> 3133.2
for me when I do that

3130.5 --> 3135.599
afterward because when I do it it's just

3133.2 --> 3138.4199999999996
I just do it there's nothing holding me

3135.599 --> 3142.28
back but afterward it does make me a

3138.42 --> 3142.28
little nervous that I do that

3146.96 --> 3152.96
more scared of me than Bill Gates oh my

3150.66 --> 3152.96
God

3160.5 --> 3165.98
that's

3162.059 --> 3165.98
that's really disappointing

3166.859 --> 3173.16
so they're among those then well maybe

3170.88 --> 3176.1600000000003
just a couple of need need to die

3173.16 --> 3178.859
terribly through their own stupidity

3176.16 --> 3181.0789999999997
before they start to get a hint and it

3178.859 --> 3183.72
really feels like that it's just that

3181.079 --> 3187.819
these people are so stubborn as sheep

3183.72 --> 3187.819
that literally like just

3188.04 --> 3193.079
they all have to have somebody like

3190.8 --> 3195.599
right next to them which they take for

3193.079 --> 3199.92
granted like been with them

3195.599 --> 3202.319
do work whatever family just die because

3199.92 --> 3204.359
of this [ __ ] because oh what we're just

3202.319 --> 3207.18
doing what we said and then you [ __ ]

3204.359 --> 3209.88
die right maybe they just need to have

3207.18 --> 3212.22
that like everybody needs to lose

3209.88 --> 3215.52
somebody close to them

3212.22 --> 3218.52
before they wake the [ __ ] up

3215.52 --> 3222.2
right or they don't and they double down

3218.52 --> 3222.2
and then they die

3228.18 --> 3230.72
all right

3231.48 --> 3234.5
it's yeah

3241.5 --> 3244.5
right

3246.24 --> 3250.7999999999997
have you also like if they're really

3249.119 --> 3252.359
more scared of you than a Bill Gates

3250.8 --> 3255.059
have you ever

3252.359 --> 3256.619
played like a clip summary of some of

3255.059 --> 3259.559
the things that Bill Gates has actually

3256.619 --> 3262.559
said have you ever like just showed that

3259.559 --> 3265.98
and ones without dramatic music or

3262.559 --> 3269.4
Graphics or commentary just raw things

3265.98 --> 3271.859
he said no commentary nothing on it just

3269.4 --> 3275.4
the things he said like five minute

3271.859 --> 3278.88
video with some of the most weird freaky

3275.4 --> 3281.579
statements with him on camera usually

3278.88 --> 3284.579
that's enough to eventually people that

3281.579 --> 3286.1400000000003
think oh my God you're scary like oh you

3284.579 --> 3289.92
think I'm scary

3286.14 --> 3292.5
take a look at this that's the guy

3289.92 --> 3294.0
making the vaccines that you are all

3292.5 --> 3296.54
taking

3294.0 --> 3296.54
right

3303.059 --> 3307.2000000000003
just or when explaining the stupidity of

3305.579 --> 3309.8590000000004
people's thoughts

3307.2 --> 3309.859
all right

3312.119 --> 3317.2200000000003
I I hope I hope it helps geminator

3317.52 --> 3319.88
cause

3320.28 --> 3327.059
the problem sometimes is is that to be

3323.94 --> 3329.819
stupid is easier

3327.059 --> 3332.88
than it is for somebody smart

3329.819 --> 3336.599
to figure out how to deal with stupidity

3332.88 --> 3338.94
so stupidity ironically brings more

3336.599 --> 3340.02
complications

3338.94 --> 3343.5
right

3340.02 --> 3346.98
because the stupid is artificial the

3343.5 --> 3350.4
mechanism to keep the stupid in place is

3346.98 --> 3352.92
more complex it's actually bypassing the

3350.4 --> 3355.44
real true intelligence in order to

3352.92 --> 3357.359
prevent it from slipping through

3355.44 --> 3360.7200000000003
like and well

3357.359 --> 3362.94
this mechanism exists in many ways and

3360.72 --> 3365.64
Ballers the trenchers have this like

3362.94 --> 3368.2200000000003
nothing else purely dedicated to the

3365.64 --> 3371.04
cosmogeny of their religious

3368.22 --> 3372.299
cosmology the ball ball Earthen outer

3371.04 --> 3374.7
space

3372.299 --> 3378.0
right so they have a lot of intelligence

3374.7 --> 3380.0
yet they are stupid because they use all

3378.0 --> 3383.94
that intelligence

3380.0 --> 3386.339
subconsciously to prevent certain key

3383.94 --> 3389.099
information from reaching their

3386.339 --> 3391.44
Consciousness forcing them to completely

3389.099 --> 3392.88
transform their approach

3391.44 --> 3396.119
right

3392.88 --> 3397.7000000000003
that's not acting stupid

3396.119 --> 3400.559
it is

3397.7 --> 3403.799
artificial idiocy

3400.559 --> 3405.9
and it's based on fear and religious

3403.799 --> 3408.18
military it's artificial stupidity

3405.9 --> 3411.48
stupidity it's not acted stupidity

3408.18 --> 3413.7
because they are literally stupid in

3411.48 --> 3416.46
those moments

3413.7 --> 3420.9199999999996
but that stupid is not their default

3416.46 --> 3420.92
it's artificially induced

3422.94 --> 3429.96
right and it's not a conscious process

3426.42 --> 3433.079
it's not acting stupid right

3429.96 --> 3435.839
people only act stupid out of basic

3433.079 --> 3438.599
convenience to prevent getting too much

3435.839 --> 3440.22
attention in a moment attention in a

3438.599 --> 3444.599
moment where tensions are high that's

3440.22 --> 3448.5589999999997
acting stupid that's not what this is

3444.599 --> 3452.1600000000003
this is a fair mechanism

3448.559 --> 3455.6400000000003
like unable to escape

3452.16 --> 3459.299
certain types of trust that you rely on

3455.64 --> 3461.359
and then your excess intelligence is

3459.299 --> 3464.64
subconsciously

3461.359 --> 3466.5
transforming the way you keep looking at

3464.64 --> 3468.2
the world so the intelligence is

3466.5 --> 3472.14
actually

3468.2 --> 3473.7599999999998
effectively reroute it for Consciousness

3472.14 --> 3477.54
management

3473.76 --> 3481.079
and with it with that process you

3477.54 --> 3484.5
effectively in your conscious existence

3481.079 --> 3488.0
are less intelligent that's not acting

3484.5 --> 3490.799
stupid it's artificially induced

3488.0 --> 3495.2
by the mind control

3490.799 --> 3495.2
that people do to themselves

3497.16 --> 3502.5789999999997
and it's subconscious

3500.04 --> 3502.579
anyway

3502.98 --> 3507.38
thank you for sharing that

3510.059 --> 3515.579
because I am always interested to see

3512.579 --> 3520.1600000000003
what the response will be when people

3515.579 --> 3520.1600000000003
are faced with me and what I do

3520.619 --> 3527.28
I yeah I provoke a lot of

3524.16 --> 3531.7799999999997
transformation a lot of things happen

3527.28 --> 3534.98
when people are confronted with me

3531.78 --> 3534.98
it always is

3542.7 --> 3548.5789999999997
he is the real boogeyman what

3545.76 --> 3551.4
Bill Gates the movie oh bill yeah yeah

3548.579 --> 3554.6600000000003
the boogie man

3551.4 --> 3554.6600000000003
now he's just a

3554.819 --> 3558.54
he's

3556.41 --> 3561.5989999999997
[Music]

3558.54 --> 3565.02
that guy's born vacant

3561.599 --> 3568.38
like he is so empty yet has so much

3565.02 --> 3570.059
power that it's he's just kind of like a

3568.38 --> 3573.42
throne for Satan

3570.059 --> 3576.3190000000004
so he is barely there it's just power

3573.42 --> 3576.319
wielding him

3576.9 --> 3584.46
that's Bill Gates in a nutshell totally

3579.72 --> 3587.2799999999997
vacant just power wielding him

3584.46 --> 3589.38
just a few basic principles so far

3587.28 --> 3592.3190000000004
detached from any form of humanity it's

3589.38 --> 3594.7200000000003
just the powers just wielding him and he

3592.319 --> 3597.5589999999997
doesn't know how to stop he doesn't know

3594.72 --> 3597.5589999999997
how to get back

3598.319 --> 3601.16
he's gone

3601.26 --> 3605.119
gone for a long time

3606.9 --> 3610.94
maybe he had a soul when he was like

3611.22 --> 3614.7799999999997
a baby or a little kid

3620.88 --> 3624.6800000000003
yeah that'd say there I know

3626.22 --> 3631.14
yeah yeah I heard yeah producing

3629.28 --> 3634.7400000000002
childhood death is going well with the

3631.14 --> 3638.04
vaccine right so that's and he said that

3634.74 --> 3640.4399999999996
with face on video

3638.04 --> 3642.74
like that's the video you got to show

3640.44 --> 3642.7400000000002
people

3643.319 --> 3650.099
when they are afraid of me right then

3647.76 --> 3651.599
show them that video right so what about

3650.099 --> 3653.88
this guy what do you think about that

3651.599 --> 3657.079
guy that guy makes your vaccines

3653.88 --> 3657.079
what do you think about that

3657.95 --> 3661.12
[Applause]

3663.9 --> 3670.02
my foot in the door with the god Rufus

3667.98 --> 3671.94
the [ __ ]

3670.02 --> 3674.52
really

3671.94 --> 3678.78
how

3674.52 --> 3681.0
what what am I supposed to do there

3678.78 --> 3684.8390000000004
seriously what am I

3681.0 --> 3687.18
supposed to do as a politician

3684.839 --> 3689.4
only thing it does is basically take

3687.18 --> 3691.44
away all my freedom to basically say

3689.4 --> 3693.599
things as they are and to just live a

3691.44 --> 3695.88
normal life without constantly getting

3693.599 --> 3696.839
hassled and nitpicked to death from all

3695.88 --> 3700.559
sides

3696.839 --> 3702.68
and smeared and manipulated and blah

3700.559 --> 3702.6800000000003
blah

3703.319 --> 3709.319
I don't know man

3705.66 --> 3712.2599999999998
look if I have influence right if

3709.319 --> 3715.68
there's people listening to me awesome

3712.26 --> 3719.28
right that is cool I like that

3715.68 --> 3722.339
it's it's very simple if you're there

3719.28 --> 3725.3390000000004
you can do that if you if you can do

3722.339 --> 3728.2799999999997
politics if you have the connections you

3725.339 --> 3731.52
have everything you need

3728.28 --> 3734.7000000000003
and you just do the right thing

3731.52 --> 3737.46
that's good that's enough like why would

3734.7 --> 3741.48
I need to basically step away from this

3737.46 --> 3744.2
and then get into politics oh my God

3741.48 --> 3744.2
ah

3748.619 --> 3753.599
the power of language that's all you

3750.42 --> 3757.94
need why I have the power of language

3753.599 --> 3760.619
and I am speaking and I hope that maybe

3757.94 --> 3763.859
people are listening and if the

3760.619 --> 3767.6400000000003
politicians are not listening to me then

3763.859 --> 3770.16
maybe they have information gatherers

3767.64 --> 3772.0789999999997
to study the field that I've picked up

3770.16 --> 3774.0
on me are listening to me

3772.079 --> 3777.299
or

3774.0 --> 3779.7
other people that are listening to me

3777.299 --> 3784.14
that are impressed that they pick up on

3779.7 --> 3786.8999999999996
them so through others I hope to reach

3784.14 --> 3789.5989999999997
the people that really need to hear this

3786.9 --> 3792.02
[ __ ] right that's what I'm trying to

3789.599 --> 3792.02
achieve

3798.66 --> 3807.44
maybe king of Europe oh my God

3802.44 --> 3807.44
yeah and who's gonna accept that serious

3808.2 --> 3813.0
now it wouldn't be a king it would be an

3810.78 --> 3814.6800000000003
emperor because there's other kings it

3813.0 --> 3816.42
doesn't work that way

3814.68 --> 3817.68
and

3816.42 --> 3821.42
like

3817.68 --> 3821.4199999999996
how long you think that'll last

3821.94 --> 3828.539
what you really think they're gonna

3823.98 --> 3831.539
accept a a like a good leader really in

3828.539 --> 3833.1600000000003
this age no that's gonna be over in a

3831.539 --> 3835.559
week

3833.16 --> 3837.5389999999998
a week before they got me assassinated

3835.559 --> 3839.78
if I do that like there's no freaking

3837.539 --> 3839.78
way

3843.18 --> 3847.3799999999997
King darling uh

3847.559 --> 3850.4
okay

3851.76 --> 3857.579
oh maybe King in spirit

3854.42 --> 3859.799
that's as far as I would want to go

3857.579 --> 3862.559
right

3859.799 --> 3866.88
if I need to be the light Beacon and the

3862.559 --> 3868.799
spiritual realm they'll give some

3866.88 --> 3870.7200000000003
few ahead

3868.799 --> 3872.819
so that everybody can do what's

3870.72 --> 3874.9199999999996
necessary that's good enough for me if

3872.819 --> 3877.619
that makes me some kind of a king or

3874.92 --> 3881.2200000000003
metaphorically or whatever fine

3877.619 --> 3882.299
but like a literal King a ruler of the

3881.22 --> 3885.5989999999997
Earth

3882.299 --> 3888.079
uh I don't think that works

3885.599 --> 3888.079
right

3895.26 --> 3899.9
I would become the next Dutch button

3900.68 --> 3907.74
oh my God that's that's hilarious

3904.5 --> 3912.0
brother that's hilarious

3907.74 --> 3916.319
although I am honored by the comparison

3912.0 --> 3920.039
serious me dude like Putin is

3916.319 --> 3922.5589999999997
like he's a he's chill man like that guy

3920.039 --> 3924.8390000000004
has nerves to steal dude he's been in

3922.559 --> 3926.94
Secret Service he's seen some really

3924.839 --> 3930.319
dark [ __ ] too

3926.94 --> 3930.319
and pulled through that

3931.68 --> 3936.7799999999997
I am like no

3939.42 --> 3945.02
no I'm a completely different type of

3942.0 --> 3945.02
character as Putin

3952.14 --> 3959.22
but I don't know if I if maybe just if

3956.94 --> 3961.7400000000002
I'd carry the store the torch of that

3959.22 --> 3964.14
Spirit of the method of just the way of

3961.74 --> 3966.839
doing things and being diplomatic and

3964.14 --> 3970.799
being smart and tactical but not just

3966.839 --> 3973.74
for personal advantage or something well

3970.799 --> 3976.14
maybe I could follow the methodology or

3973.74 --> 3978.5
encourage others to do that I've been

3976.14 --> 3982.74
trying that for a while like I've been

3978.5 --> 3984.18
shouting out Putin 10 years ago

3982.74 --> 3987.5989999999997
serious

3984.18 --> 3990.4199999999996
like when he was like Mega being

3987.599 --> 3992.52
barraged to be the ultimate Hitler by

3990.42 --> 3994.799
media which happened in the Netherlands

3992.52 --> 3997.92
a lot I was out there just saying like

3994.799 --> 4000.92
this is this is the devil or the media

3997.92 --> 4002.96
is the devil and this is why this is

4000.92 --> 4004.339
what Putin's doing this is what we're

4002.96 --> 4007.46
doing

4004.339 --> 4010.339
right when that wasn't as obvious it's

4007.46 --> 4013.52
more obvious now that that's the case

4010.339 --> 4015.2
or that that used to be the case

4013.52 --> 4016.52
now it's just

4015.2 --> 4019.5989999999997
yeah

4016.52 --> 4019.599
maybe too late

4020.599 --> 4023.1400000000003
but

4025.7 --> 4030.22
first on the execution list got

4034.94 --> 4040.7000000000003
no I don't think like there's no

4037.52 --> 4043.28
execution list just yet it's rather that

4040.7 --> 4045.819
eventually there will be execution lists

4043.28 --> 4045.8190000000004
and then

4049.52 --> 4054.68
all right I'm like I don't have I don't

4052.22 --> 4057.9199999999996
really even have a kill list it's just

4054.68 --> 4060.799
that I am just fully expecting there is

4057.92 --> 4063.2000000000003
going to be that in the future

4060.799 --> 4065.68
like there's just going to be a

4063.2 --> 4065.68
situation

4066.98 --> 4072.98
where it like really [ __ ] up

4070.46 --> 4075.559
probably because of the vaccines right

4072.98 --> 4077.059
if just some of these things that I've

4075.559 --> 4079.119
heard about it

4077.059 --> 4082.3390000000004
are true

4079.119 --> 4085.099
then just

4082.339 --> 4088.16
and I don't know if it's true but if it

4085.099 --> 4091.099
is and that is that people that get

4088.16 --> 4093.92
vaccinated might simply their presence

4091.099 --> 4096.38
just their presence

4093.92 --> 4098.659
in a vicinity of pregnant women cause

4096.38 --> 4102.219
could cause them to cause spontaneous

4098.659 --> 4108.199
abortion right well that's a situation

4102.219 --> 4110.38
that if freaking 50 is vaccinated

4108.199 --> 4113.54
that could have like

4110.38 --> 4117.259
ultimate dramatic results

4113.54 --> 4119.719
and then yeah there will be execution

4117.259 --> 4121.279
lists even though that I won't be

4119.719 --> 4123.62
writing it down

4121.279 --> 4126.219
it's just the consequences of everything

4123.62 --> 4126.219
that's happened

4133.159 --> 4139.299
what the hell okay yeah by the way hello

4136.279 --> 4139.299000000001
Julio paven

4140.659 --> 4144.699
execution is not what I did

4145.58 --> 4150.88
I just I just want the lies to go away

4156.44 --> 4162.259
I want

4157.88 --> 4165.1990000000005
the people the locals the ones that were

4162.259 --> 4168.38
here and have roots in these lands here

4165.199 --> 4171.62
in the Netherlands and surrounding I

4168.38 --> 4175.6990000000005
just want them to survive and to not get

4171.62 --> 4177.8589999999995
completely routed by

4175.699 --> 4179.9
the New World Order

4177.859 --> 4183.799
right because that's happening they are

4179.9 --> 4186.5
planning to completely exterminate

4183.799 --> 4189.56
the vast vast majority of the original

4186.5 --> 4191.359
populations to completely unroot them

4189.56 --> 4194.859
that's what their plan is and they're

4191.359 --> 4194.859
not going to stop doing that

4195.32 --> 4199.699
right

4197.3 --> 4202.06
and that's the thing that infuriates me

4199.699 --> 4202.0599999999995
the most

4202.219 --> 4208.659
that they're doing that right

4205.64 --> 4212.0
because now there's just the whole

4208.659 --> 4213.92
groups of people that have been

4212.0 --> 4217.76
spiritually

4213.92 --> 4220.88
and wrote it uprooted

4217.76 --> 4224.12
so yeah no surprise they are seeking out

4220.88 --> 4227.2390000000005
death they're seeking out just dream

4224.12 --> 4230.54
until they die because they're being

4227.239 --> 4233.299999999999
denied existence

4230.54 --> 4235.42
right through propaganda through the

4233.3 --> 4238.179
power structure they are being

4235.42 --> 4239.86
discriminated against and effectively

4238.179 --> 4243.02
denied

4239.86 --> 4246.32
continued existence

4243.02 --> 4250.34
and that's the thing that it just that

4246.32 --> 4252.44
brings out Odin's wrath in me

4250.34 --> 4254.679
that's the one thing I'm not gonna let

4252.44 --> 4254.678999999999
go

4258.86 --> 4262.48
right it's genocide

4279.679 --> 4282.28
what

4283.04 --> 4286.9
awesome

4284.06 --> 4286.900000000001

4357.02 --> 4359.14
that

4383.659 --> 4390.4
this is strange

4386.06 --> 4390.400000000001
strange conversations on the show today

4404.6 --> 4409.4800000000005
that is like wondering if Dorothy ever

4407.0 --> 4409.48
got home

4445.94 --> 4448.94
foreign

4467.48 --> 4475.0

4561.56 --> 4565.96
might be like the 90s or something

4583.64 --> 4590.320000000001

no idea what you're blabbering about

4939.26 --> 4943.46
Russia has everything they need well

4941.36 --> 4945.98
that's only because they've become

4943.46 --> 4948.08
completely self-sufficient

4945.98 --> 4950.839999999999
because they had to because they've been

4948.08 --> 4952.699
sanctioned the [ __ ] out of for a very

4950.84 --> 4955.2390000000005
long time

4952.699 --> 4955.239
right

4980.48 --> 4986.36
all right Daniel field

4983.199 --> 4989.678999999999

4989.679 --> 4997.159
America is like a pathetic hag [ __ ]

5018.58 --> 5023.8

5032.86 --> 5040.12
from Lady Liberty to demonic vengeful

5036.6 --> 5042.719

5114.46 --> 5117.42
Earth debate starts

5120.76 --> 5124.62
the jet is slowing down

5151.84 --> 5155.219
Logan's drive right

5158.8 --> 5161.34
I

5183.699 --> 5190.08
thought

5185.52 --> 5190.080000000001
ah and the sun is coming back oh

5197.32 --> 5202.48
yeah by the way the uh flowering trees

5200.8 --> 5204.58
down there

5202.48 --> 5207.36
seems like they're finally gonna go into

5204.58 --> 5207.36
Blossom again

5209.8 --> 5214.5
so

5211.48 --> 5214.5
it's gonna be nice

5222.88 --> 5225.12
foreign

5231.719 --> 5235.56
so come on guys

5235.84 --> 5238.8
give me something

5261.82 --> 5265.659
what do you guys think is gonna break

5263.62 --> 5268.679
loose is there gonna be war between

5265.659 --> 5268.679
Russia and America

5269.44 --> 5275.799999999999
will they indeed just like bring out

5272.679 --> 5280.1990000000005
everything use it to completely

5275.8 --> 5280.1990000000005
clamp down Beyond Corona situation

5280.42 --> 5285.9
Putin band genetically modified food yes

5282.699 --> 5285.9
I know it's awesome

5288.28 --> 5291.12
it's very awesome

5301.12 --> 5309.699
like for me the the only like the only

5305.699 --> 5311.86
real objection that I personally have

5309.699 --> 5314.98
is

5311.86 --> 5318.46
like Howies with cannabis

5314.98 --> 5321.099999999999
like how he's against that a lot like

5318.46 --> 5325.42
it's really illegal in Russia that's

5321.1 --> 5329.820000000001
like the only thing the only thing

5325.42 --> 5332.8
that just gives me like that's a problem

5329.82 --> 5336.219
the only thing

5332.8 --> 5339.639
get it that's pretty remarkable

5336.219 --> 5342.4800000000005
just one thing one objection to the

5339.639 --> 5342.4800000000005
entire thing

5342.699 --> 5348.48
and that's that cannabis is just

5345.04 --> 5348.48
straight out illegal right

5349.78 --> 5354.0
that's really the only problem I have

5355.54 --> 5361.6
the rest just Russia is awesome it's not

5358.96 --> 5363.82
perfect of course not it's a huge

5361.6 --> 5366.88
country they have problems they have

5363.82 --> 5371.28
they have pollution problems right but

5366.88 --> 5371.28
these problems can be fixed

5371.44 --> 5373.919999999999
right

5376.84 --> 5382.78
especially as technology keeps

5379.659 --> 5387.04
developing they can be fixed

5382.78 --> 5389.259999999999
and there is just engineered better

5387.04 --> 5391.42
solutions that they

5389.26 --> 5395.34
can eventually

5391.42 --> 5395.34
use and and all that so

5395.56 --> 5402.06
anyway

5397.84 --> 5402.06
do what's up with all the

5402.58 --> 5406.92
uh

5403.48 --> 5406.919999999999
flops from Skype

5409.44 --> 5414.28
Contraband is a very complicated thing

5412.12 --> 5417.54
in Russia for a lot of reasons what I

5414.28 --> 5417.54
don't know what you mean with that

5431.199 --> 5436.48
generator we need to reject war no

5434.08 --> 5439.679
matter what they say

5436.48 --> 5439.678999999999
it depends

5442.06 --> 5448.06
like it's complicated

5444.639 --> 5450.46
what needs to be

5448.06 --> 5454.080000000001
draw Contraband black market right yes

5450.46 --> 5454.08
exactly okay I get it

5460.239 --> 5468.459999999999
right but the thing is if they

5463.659 --> 5471.099999999999
just allow cannabis to become

5468.46 --> 5474.1
I don't know condoned

5471.1 --> 5476.1990000000005
just not just not criminalize it right

5474.1 --> 5477.9400000000005
that people can actually grow it

5476.199 --> 5479.739
themselves

5477.94 --> 5482.86
right

5479.739 --> 5485.98
like I did the Dutch policy for example

5482.86 --> 5489.219
like it's not the best it's just it's

5485.98 --> 5491.5
not fully legalized like in Colorado for

5489.219 --> 5494.7390000000005
example in the United States

5491.5 --> 5497.92
but at least like it does kind of work

5494.739 --> 5500.379999999999
and it does prevent like a big black

5497.92 --> 5504.88
market problem right Black Market

5500.38 --> 5508.0
problems is where control is lost

5504.88 --> 5510.28
and [ __ ] can slip through including from

5508.0 --> 5512.679
hostile entities

5510.28 --> 5515.679
right that's the problem that's the

5512.679 --> 5518.56
problem about making drugs illegal is

5515.679 --> 5519.82
that dark influences actually get

5518.56 --> 5522.96
control

5519.82 --> 5522.96
and you don't want that

5525.34 --> 5529.54
right but as you say it's all very

5527.8 --> 5533.56
complicated

5529.54 --> 5537.5199999999995
like once cartels gain control of Market

5533.56 --> 5539.8
of illegal Goods then they don't want it

5537.52 --> 5541.900000000001
to be legalized anymore right so that

5539.8 --> 5544.4800000000005
may be the very reason

5541.9 --> 5546.82
why it's not legal is because the

5544.48 --> 5549.28
criminal cartels in control of it don't

5546.82 --> 5550.659
want it to be legal

5549.28 --> 5554.639
so

5550.659 --> 5554.638999999999
who knows how that all works

5560.86 --> 5563.759999999999
no

5565.12 --> 5567.54
anyway

5570.34 --> 5575.4400000000005
yeah back to the the statement about war

5573.4 --> 5577.36
like War might

5575.44 --> 5581.98
happen

5577.36 --> 5585.759999999999
it's just that as long as

5581.98 --> 5588.159
there's no Panic moves like

5585.76 --> 5592.2390000000005
as soon as like a lot of things get

5588.159 --> 5594.879999999999
destroyed especially like yeah

5592.239 --> 5597.459999999999
when there's too much destroyed that's

5594.88 --> 5600.159000000001
when things get really bad because then

5597.46 --> 5602.9800000000005
there is like bad blood

5600.159 --> 5605.5599999999995
like if it's just a conflict and it

5602.98 --> 5609.099999999999
moves more towards a

5605.56 --> 5611.679
Cold War situation

5609.1 --> 5614.26
then

5611.679 --> 5616.12
yeah the long-term damage doesn't have

5614.26 --> 5619.2390000000005
to be dramatic

5616.12 --> 5621.5199999999995
right it's when there's a real hot War

5619.239 --> 5622.78
that's gonna unfold that's when you got

5621.52 --> 5626.860000000001
a problem

5622.78 --> 5629.44
a big problem right that's once a really

5626.86 --> 5632.08
hot war starts that's when a lot of [ __ ]

5629.44 --> 5634.0599999999995
gets destroyed whether they're nukes or

5632.08 --> 5637.5
not is not even relevant to that that

5634.06 --> 5637.5
would just be extra bad

5638.08 --> 5643.96
but when there's a hot War then

5641.02 --> 5647.320000000001
it's like it will very likely go to a

5643.96 --> 5649.6
situation where just one party Falls and

5647.32 --> 5651.82
everything that ties in with it and that

5649.6 --> 5653.4400000000005
means that who knows man that part of

5651.82 --> 5656.44
the world is just going to go through a

5653.44 --> 5658.12
terrible time terrible

5656.44 --> 5661.96
where they're going to become Financial

5658.12 --> 5663.88
slaves just to get reparations for the

5661.96 --> 5664.6
damage their side has caused on the

5663.88 --> 5667.2390000000005
other

5664.6 --> 5669.179
that's what real hot Wars end up with

5667.239 --> 5672.12
and it's terrible

5669.179 --> 5674.4400000000005
especially with the amount of maniacal

5672.12 --> 5676.719
Psychopaths that are already in places

5674.44 --> 5678.759999999999
of control right now because they're not

5676.719 --> 5683.44
going to help that now they're going to

5678.76 --> 5686.679
exploit it to murderous levels right so

5683.44 --> 5689.58
a hot war is extremely dangerous

5686.679 --> 5689.58
for the long run

5692.08 --> 5696.219
right

5694.36 --> 5700.48
and I think that

5696.219 --> 5703.3
the parties involved know that

5700.48 --> 5705.459999999999
so I think that I don't know a real hot

5703.3 --> 5708.159000000001
War I don't see it really happening they

5705.46 --> 5711.1
might suggest it just to Hype it up just

5708.159 --> 5713.739
to sell the news just to bring the

5711.1 --> 5716.92
squirters out there a heart attack just

5713.739 --> 5719.739
to do it like that right

5716.92 --> 5722.1990000000005
but yeah when literally cities are gonna

5719.739 --> 5725.759999999999
get blown up then you know like okay now

5722.199 --> 5725.759999999999
yeah now we're all [ __ ]

5727.48 --> 5730.718999999999
but if it's just going to be I don't

5729.639 --> 5734.679
know

5730.719 --> 5737.199
aircraft carriers or bases with strikes

5734.679 --> 5740.8
or something like that as long doesn't

5737.199 --> 5743.04
move beyond that then we might survive

5740.8 --> 5743.04
it

5743.98 --> 5746.98
uh

5764.619 --> 5770.86
we now have legal THC in Texas called

5767.739 --> 5772.659
Delta ADHD okay Chris Berry that's

5770.86 --> 5774.339999999999
interesting

5772.659 --> 5778.0599999999995
so

5774.34 --> 5782.6990000000005
cannabis is not illegal but THC THC

5778.06 --> 5782.6990000000005
crystal is is that the idea

5784.48 --> 5787.08
weird

5800.739 --> 5807.599999999999
in Colorado it's going like it's like

5803.679 --> 5807.6
going to the dentist okay that's weird

5808.36 --> 5814.0599999999995
they have a lot of rules don't they but

5811.48 --> 5816.659
to produce it is really easy

5814.06 --> 5816.659000000001
right

5817.36 --> 5821.159
because there's a lot of room and

5822.34 --> 5825.119000000001
I don't know

5838.06 --> 5843.900000000001
I love seeking star Water by the way

5840.88 --> 5843.900000000001
you're late

5847.36 --> 5854.5199999999995
it's a legal loophole what the American

5850.42 --> 5858.58
way a Chris Berry the American way

5854.52 --> 5860.9800000000005
Liz the entirety of America is just one

5858.58 --> 5862.719
legal loophole that's how it all hangs

5860.98 --> 5864.638999999999
together it's just a whole bunch of

5862.719 --> 5867.1
legal loopholes that keep it strung

5864.639 --> 5870.219
together while there is a pretense that

5867.1 --> 5871.42
basically everything is illegal

5870.219 --> 5875.02
right

5871.42 --> 5877.119
so only the smart that it's basically

5875.02 --> 5879.6990000000005
the the grappler's land of opportunity

5877.119 --> 5881.799999999999
like you can just get around through

5879.699 --> 5884.199
legal loopholes

5881.8 --> 5886.3
and just really crush it but if you

5884.199 --> 5889.379999999999
don't know it then yeah you're gonna be

5886.3 --> 5889.38
the slave

5892.78 --> 5899.58
regulations security you need Ray or

5895.719 --> 5899.58
what eraser wire fences what

5905.38 --> 5908.04
really

5909.82 --> 5912.42
all right

5913.36 --> 5916.32
bizarre

5925.179 --> 5929.38
all right anyway I'm gonna round out the

5927.04 --> 5932.32
show guys

5929.38 --> 5933.91

[Music]

5935.619 --> 5940.0199999999995
it is 4 20 today after all

5940.42 --> 5946.36
kind of weird conversations about

5943.08 --> 5949.54
Putin and

5946.36 --> 5951.699
me supposedly being a king that that was

5949.54 --> 5952.9
weird hearing that out of people in my

5951.699 --> 5955.599999999999
chat

5952.9 --> 5957.879999999999
right like not like a trolling

5955.6 --> 5960.219
so that's kind of weird

5957.88 --> 5962.7390000000005
at least I think Nathan R is not

5960.219 --> 5965.86
actually trolling

5962.739 --> 5969.28
it's more like bearing it's like what

5965.86 --> 5971.679
bears do I hear that sort of funny that

5969.28 --> 5974.199
type of approach over at own Benjamins

5971.679 --> 5978.36

5974.199 --> 5981.48
