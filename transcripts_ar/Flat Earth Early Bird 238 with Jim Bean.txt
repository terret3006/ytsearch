[Music]

37.69 --> 45.44
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

41.39 --> 46.239000000000004
early-bird number 100 know what I'm

45.44 --> 52.07
saying

46.239 --> 53.839
238 come back in time 238 I'm your host

52.07 --> 55.55
Arwen and before we start the show

53.839 --> 57.92
please don't forget to share it on any

55.55 --> 59.56999999999999
platform you deem fit and if you haven't

57.92 --> 61.22
already subscribed to my channel and hit

59.57 --> 63.14
the bell notification so you know when

61.22 --> 66.77
I'm going live which is normally 2:00

63.14 --> 68.96000000000001
p.m. Amsterdam time every day also

66.77 --> 74.03
please support my show through superjet

68.96 --> 78.13999999999999
paypal atrium and through my GoFundMe so

74.03 --> 81.44
the weather today is it's not what it

78.14 --> 86.479
used to be that's actually very cloudy

81.44 --> 88.13
cold yeah I'm it's the first 1/2 I'm

86.479 --> 97.85
sitting in my sweater again because it's

88.13 --> 100.54899999999999
just not as warm anymore what well can't

97.85 --> 104.57
be sunny everyday in the Netherlands no

100.549 --> 110.50900000000001
less so today I got with me tumeric

104.57 --> 110.99
coffee tea band Illuminati cousin for a

110.509 --> 113.39
change

110.99 --> 117.19999999999999
I'm really hungry so I'm gonna basically

113.39 --> 121.28
eat that the first few minutes of the

117.2 --> 123.74000000000001
show but before I go there it's using

121.28 --> 125.63
chat I started up the show pretty late

123.74 --> 128.63
so I'm not expecting a lot of people to

125.63 --> 132.92
be in there yet drunken ballot for 1 1

128.63 --> 135.31
over mu KU killed the hope yeah good to

132.92 --> 135.30999999999997
see you guys

146.44 --> 158.16
yeah yesterday wasn't pretty nuts for me

149.17 --> 162.42
media-wise considering also I I watched

158.16 --> 167.59
the Sunday show of the Alex Jones Show

162.42 --> 175.26999999999998
and it was just completely nuts it was

167.59 --> 185.23000000000002
so out there I was just like wow it's

175.27 --> 189.96
getting kind of overkill these weird

185.23 --> 193.85999999999999
references to to Elon Musk and

189.96 --> 199.60000000000002
apparently even must get some weird a I

193.86 --> 201.64000000000001
surrender is attitude some while back

199.6 --> 205.54
and now that's all being hyped up as

201.64 --> 208.48
it's so ridiculous all of it it's just

205.54 --> 210.22
really embarrassing but yeah that was

208.48 --> 214.32999999999998
apparently a thing yesterday and of

210.22 --> 218.53
course the issue with Epstein getting

214.33 --> 225.79000000000002
caught or getting arrested that's still

218.53 --> 231.81
ongoing hmm oh yeah I'm talking about

225.79 --> 236.709
Elon Musk also watch a jaren yesterday a

231.81 --> 244.15
very good show and it was hilarious

236.709 --> 248.77
because he was basically showing another

244.15 --> 252.94
what is it that Joe Rogan show with a

248.77 --> 254.86
guy that was well a small hat even as as

252.94 --> 256.77
Jaron would say I thought it was pretty

254.86 --> 260.44
cool that it would signify it like that

256.77 --> 266.16999999999996
and the guy was just spinning a story

260.44 --> 268.12
together that was just so such a science

266.17 --> 271.18
fiction fantasy story of epic

268.12 --> 274.95
proportions and the guy knew it and he

271.18 --> 274.95
was enjoying telling that

275.63 --> 282.3
and it was just so over-the-top and like

278.94 --> 284.67
that whole situation and then watching

282.3 --> 287.75
alex jones also getting kind of over the

284.67 --> 295.59000000000003
top with his approach to it who is just

287.75 --> 299.52
it made me like jesus just starts to

295.59 --> 307.46999999999997
blur my mind like so much ball [ __ ]

299.52 --> 309.04999999999995
everywhere anyway other people leaking

307.47 --> 316.52000000000004
in runny fashi

309.05 --> 316.52000000000004
Tony V a ratio perfect let's see you

325.59 --> 346.08
hello Amanda you oh man

342.28 --> 349.50899999999996
I got like a sore throat I think

346.08 --> 354.19
probably from a combination of all the

349.509 --> 357.19
weather sudden cold weather and like

354.19 --> 359.229
before I got here I went to coffee shop

357.19 --> 363.82
again and this time I got caught in a

359.229 --> 367.21
conversation with two guys and we went

363.82 --> 369.55
on for hours it was a really good

367.21 --> 372.28
conversation and we even got into

369.55 --> 374.949
freaking flatter so that's kind of a

372.28 --> 378.849
rarity that we would end up there but

374.949 --> 381.31
they were very decent guys fair pretty

378.849 --> 383.56
smart and open-minded and one of them

381.31 --> 385.599
was like really getting curious

383.56 --> 388.21
eventually the other guy already left I

385.599 --> 393.3
was really getting curious about Flat

388.21 --> 396.54999999999995
Earth and like he was basically staring

393.3 --> 400.87
in his mind like yeah I should research

396.55 --> 406.389
that for real so I kind of try to help

400.87 --> 410.02
him on the way on what to expect and if

406.389 --> 412.84000000000003
he can yeah the the pretty radicals

410.02 --> 414.43
usually social changes are surrounding

412.84 --> 416.10999999999996
you concerning your friends and

414.43 --> 418.659
relations so I kind of warmed him about

416.11 --> 421.63
it like yeah if you're really sure are

418.659 --> 423.639
you prepared to figure out that it's

421.63 --> 426.699
completely real and not be able to turn

423.639 --> 430.05
back are you okay with that and and the

426.699 --> 430.05
consequences that come with it

432.56 --> 437.25
and yeah I thought about it I didn't

435.72 --> 441.65000000000003
necessarily push him like yeah you have

437.25 --> 443.97
to research Flat Earth no but he was

441.65 --> 447.27
wanting to buy himself

443.97 --> 451.74
I stayed neutral the whole time I just

447.27 --> 453.9
kept sticking to ya presupposition they

451.74 --> 456.27
all just wanted to be true scientists

453.9 --> 458.13
are basically there to keep their jobs

456.27 --> 463.16999999999996
and go with the narrative to keep their

458.13 --> 465.75
jobs in their reputation and the body of

463.17 --> 467.61
science is now it's no longer science

465.75 --> 471.69
what it used to be it's now become a

467.61 --> 475.32
colloquial popular word for knowledge

471.69 --> 478.65
and that any just testing things out

475.32 --> 481.14
with the knowledge anyone could do equal

478.65 --> 484.38
science and that is the false suggestion

481.14 --> 486.41999999999996
that the culture of modern Western they

484.38 --> 488.79
call C has been polluted with and I

486.42 --> 492.57
totally put that down in front of them

488.79 --> 495.03000000000003
and they got it like I knew they got it

492.57 --> 498.48
because they you could literally see the

495.03 --> 501.08
embarrassment of it reflect off them of

498.48 --> 503.43
the full realization that I was right

501.08 --> 505.65
even though they didn't technically

503.43 --> 508.02
completely understand it yet but just

505.65 --> 512.6999999999999
because of the way I put it down they

508.02 --> 515.64
knew it and they felt it so yeah I got

512.7 --> 517.86
the guys kind of intrude I wonder if one

515.64 --> 519.539
of them might actually say hello or

517.86 --> 521.729
something in chat at some point who

519.539 --> 524.37
knows but it was a great conversation

521.729 --> 526.1700000000001
but yeah when you're in a coffee shop

524.37 --> 528.27
and you're conversing like really

526.17 --> 530.9399999999999
intensely and smoking enjoyed at the

528.27 --> 532.56
same time you get this issue where

530.94 --> 534.33
you're basically in the middle of

532.56 --> 537.2399999999999
breathing out smoke and then you catch

534.33 --> 540.63
yourself talking with the smoke and that

537.24 --> 543.36
kind of hurts my throat so I got some

540.63 --> 544.89
strain from that but I'll be alright

543.36 --> 547.01
just shouldn't be doing that all the

544.89 --> 547.01
time

549.42 --> 565.52
Oh Oh Jim Beam okay you wanted to talk

562.44 --> 565.5200000000001
on skype right

573.77 --> 576.909
[Music]

580.64 --> 601.4499999999999
okay I guess I'm gonna call Jim Beam no

596.06 --> 601.4499999999999
man hello

604.209 --> 607.75
sorry I'm eating

609.19 --> 622.36
should we get I guess I have some

618.62 --> 626.529
questions relating to gravity okay I

622.36 --> 626.529
want to ask you sure

627.07 --> 635.2090000000001
first like what is your main objection

631.459 --> 637.43
the coven's experiment well that it's

635.209 --> 640.779
not an experiment and that it doesn't

637.43 --> 649.279
prove gravity that's my main objections

640.779 --> 652.43
yeah sorry say again why would you say

649.279 --> 655.61
that it's not an experiment because it

652.43 --> 659.66
isn't it doesn't conform to the standard

655.61 --> 663.74
scientific method that's why why doesn't

659.66 --> 668.449
it because it doesn't because two plus

663.74 --> 670.269
two is in five it's four I guess when

668.449 --> 673.79
you referring to the scientific method

670.269 --> 677.48
you mean the the steps that you and

673.79 --> 680.62
Nathan and the scientific method yeah

677.48 --> 682.6700000000001
where you are trying to prove a cause by

680.62 --> 683.93
manipulating an independent variable

682.67 --> 689.39
which is the cause

683.93 --> 692.449
yes that one the one not some

689.39 --> 694.37
philosophical extrapolation from that

692.449 --> 701.56
that everybody likes to jackar off with

694.37 --> 705.26
so all right the experiment through the

701.56 --> 708.649
steps that you say the scientific method

705.26 --> 711.079
requires and it stills for me proves

708.649 --> 711.829
that you have it exists oh well good for

711.079 --> 713.27
you

711.829 --> 714.3499999999999
if you want to believe that's an

713.27 --> 717.64
experiment and

714.35 --> 722.1800000000001
to prove something yeah good for you

717.64 --> 727.43
anything else to say yeah I wanted you

722.18 --> 731.6899999999999
to go through the process that you say

727.43 --> 732.53
is the scientific method I just did no

731.69 --> 736.0400000000001
yes

732.53 --> 738.61
yes I even put down the core independent

736.04 --> 741.01
variable being the cause of the effects

738.61 --> 744.44
having to be manipulated by the

741.01 --> 747.56
experimenter if those factors are not

744.44 --> 750.2
there in that exact manner you don't

747.56 --> 753.68
have an experiment done that's all you

750.2 --> 758.09
need to know yeah yeah but you haven't

753.68 --> 760.64
asked me what I think you just assume

758.09 --> 762.5300000000001
that I don't care because everyone that

760.64 --> 765.02
says that cabinet has any kind of

762.53 --> 767.4499999999999
legitimate legitimacy always say the

765.02 --> 770.54
same things about it I don't need to

767.45 --> 772.19
hear that from you to know what your

770.54 --> 774.3499999999999
thoughts on that are because it's always

772.19 --> 784.25
the same it has been with all ballers

774.35 --> 789.98
for years I have naturally been wounded

784.25 --> 792.38
bait crazy like I would we're gonna do

789.98 --> 795.89
the steps you say are there okay so

792.38 --> 800.48
you're a newcomer fine no I watch the

795.89 --> 802.88
show for quite a while but no one that

800.48 --> 808.34
gets to the debate with you explains it

802.88 --> 810.5
the way I would okay so I'm not really

808.34 --> 813.32
interested in your interpretation of

810.5 --> 817.19
what the scientific method is though no

813.32 --> 820.25
it's yeah it is if it doesn't conform to

817.19 --> 824.44
what I just described it is what I'm

820.25 --> 826.19
saying if the rules that you say yeah

824.44 --> 828.35
those are the rules

826.19 --> 831.1700000000001
are you saying you do not abide to the

828.35 --> 834.46
rules of reality of how what things

831.17 --> 837.02
actually mean what they stand for

834.46 --> 839.69
okay so why are you trying to make a

837.02 --> 842.66
point I'm not interested in your version

839.69 --> 844.58
of the supposed scientific method there

842.66 --> 845.99
will not be the scientific method

844.58 --> 846.9300000000001
otherwise it would just be the

845.99 --> 850.05
scientific method

846.93 --> 852.66
no I'm not gonna I don't want to argue

850.05 --> 854.519
about what the scientific I I agree with

852.66 --> 857.9699999999999
you and Nathan that the scientific

854.519 --> 860.49
method is what you say it is I'm not

857.97 --> 863.4590000000001
arguing with that I'm just saying that

860.49 --> 865.949
if you apply that method to the

863.459 --> 868.8599999999999
communist experiment it shows you that

865.949 --> 869.2199999999999
there is a force that is that people can

868.86 --> 874.67
grab it

869.22 --> 878.6700000000001
and it exists now it doesn't all right

874.67 --> 883.11
do you want to do it like QE likes to do

878.67 --> 885.029
it when he writes down the yes yes you

883.11 --> 887.5500000000001
do it you know what it is in the

885.029 --> 890.73
Cavendish its mass its mass it's not

887.55 --> 894.5999999999999
gravity its mass mass mass mass mass

890.73 --> 897.5690000000001
mass wait wait wait mass mass mass mass

894.6 --> 901.529
mass it's not gravity gravity is an

897.569 --> 911.029
extrapolated come cept it's not a real

901.529 --> 913.86
thing do you want me to tell you how I

911.029 --> 918.679
have the hypothesis of the experiment in

913.86 --> 918.679
my mind and tell me where you disagree

918.769 --> 926.429
sure share me Europe all right ideas

922.17 --> 929.91
fine the independent variable if I'm

926.429 --> 937.379
correct is the variable that you change

929.91 --> 942.329
and you see the effect that that it

937.379 --> 947.73
causes and you try to establish what

942.329 --> 950.8499999999999
what the cause was no all right then

947.73 --> 954.54
what the independent variables you have

950.85 --> 956.399
to determine if it is correct first you

954.54 --> 958.079
have to have an AI pollicis then you put

956.399 --> 963.66
up in an experiment and in that

958.079 --> 967.17
experiment the end result will have to

963.66 --> 968.9699999999999
be caused by the manipulation of the

967.17 --> 971.2199999999999
independent variable which has beat has

968.97 --> 974.73
to be determined beforehand and that

971.22 --> 977.5500000000001
proves whether it is a thing or not all

974.73 --> 981.69
right so

977.55 --> 984.93
we say the independent variable the

981.69 --> 987.4200000000001
variable that we vary is the presence of

984.93 --> 990.89
the mass of the extra balls of the

987.42 --> 993.51
coven's experiment and it's the cause

990.89 --> 996.0889999999999
the independent variable is the cause so

993.51 --> 1001.1899999999999
the presence the Japanese experiment

996.089 --> 1004.3100000000001
says writes mass mass causes this minut

1001.19 --> 1008.089
spree supposed displacement that's

1004.31 --> 1011.02
extremely feeble man-made setup yeah

1008.089 --> 1015.589
yeah that's the suggestion that's right

1011.02 --> 1018.14
all right so when you see like there are

1015.589 --> 1022.0400000000001
videos on the internet for people doing

1018.14 --> 1026.929
the experiment and you see that they

1022.04 --> 1031.79
rode the bar however you say it when it

1026.929 --> 1036.3500000000001
states without the large objects on the

1031.79 --> 1038.72
side of it it rotates on a small on a

1036.35 --> 1041.809
small level it doesn't move too much but

1038.72 --> 1044.98
then when you are in the huge masses on

1041.809 --> 1048.3799999999999
the side of it it starts moving more

1044.98 --> 1051.14
right sure I'd like to see an actual

1048.38 --> 1054.6200000000001
demonstration of that besides it just a

1051.14 --> 1057.679
story I've seen a lot of experiments

1054.62 --> 1060.7099999999998
concerning Cavendish and they're always

1057.679 --> 1062.8700000000001
messy because there is no

1060.71 --> 1065.63
straightforward result there is it's

1062.87 --> 1071.0
always it's just like interpreting

1065.63 --> 1075.8600000000001
outer space signals from radio noise no

1071.0 --> 1078.44
yes there is no conclusive positive

1075.86 --> 1081.6499999999999
result every time it's an average wet

1078.44 --> 1084.77
finger work mess it always has been

1081.65 --> 1087.76
I can send you looking yeah yeah yeah

1084.77 --> 1091.1
yeah you can that's nice I know this is

1087.76 --> 1094.52
exactly what this is I asked at the time

1091.1 --> 1097.2199999999998
when it was still a believer it is a

1094.52 --> 1098.929
mess you just have to accept that that

1097.22 --> 1101.69
is the case that's what it all came down

1098.929 --> 1105.2
to because if you're gonna take it as a

1101.69 --> 1107.8400000000001
real serious experiment it's always

1105.2 --> 1109.88
going to be a feeble result it doesn't

1107.84 --> 1110.9499999999998
always work it doesn't always work with

1109.88 --> 1113.0500000000002
exactly this

1110.95 --> 1115.57
set up in exactly the same conditions

1113.05 --> 1121.6499999999999
that's the whole issue it's not a

1115.57 --> 1124.36
conclusive results oriented experiment

1121.65 --> 1127.72
by the way before continue Thank You

1124.36 --> 1130.6299999999999
mind-warped for the who 25 Australian

1127.72 --> 1133.03
dollar super chat donation hope this

1130.63 --> 1134.65
helps you out brother you're a good guy

1133.03 --> 1140.17
hope this helps yes it does

1134.65 --> 1145.48
Thank You mind-warped okay continue so

1140.17 --> 1147.73
do you see that you have seen people do

1145.48 --> 1150.9
the experiment and know to get the

1147.73 --> 1155.46
results that I tell you it gets out

1150.9 --> 1158.77
which is the the road moving

1155.46 --> 1164.65
considerably more when you put the huge

1158.77 --> 1169.59
masses on the side of it do you can you

1164.65 --> 1174.7900000000002
show me like how can you show me that

1169.59 --> 1180.6699999999998
well go ahead no you show me that that's

1174.79 --> 1184.51
really nice now you just send me the

1180.67 --> 1186.5800000000002
video that's fine enough because I'm

1184.51 --> 1190.18
pretty much made up my mind considering

1186.58 --> 1193.54
Cavendish I've already witnessed those

1190.18 --> 1196.03
things I've already discussed how Bob

1193.54 --> 1198.52
technically impossible it really is to

1196.03 --> 1201.6399999999999
isolate the independent variable which

1198.52 --> 1204.07
would be gravity by the own standards of

1201.64 --> 1205.8700000000001
the freaking body of science in which

1204.07 --> 1208.6
gravity as an actual force is

1205.87 --> 1211.2099999999998
technically insignificant and could

1208.6 --> 1214.54
potentially never be isolated properly

1211.21 --> 1221.26
in an actual experiment so even if it's

1214.54 --> 1226.1499999999999
a giant mess all of it you said that but

1221.26 --> 1228.94
I'm telling you it's not you can't give

1226.15 --> 1231.8100000000002
Alan a measure through that experiment

1228.94 --> 1235.71
gravity you just can see its effects and

1231.81 --> 1239.86
the independent variable is the masses

1235.71 --> 1242.8600000000001
whether they exist in the in near the

1239.86 --> 1243.85
road or not well sorry if you're gonna

1242.86 --> 1246.4599999999998
say

1243.85 --> 1248.9499999999998
you can only see it not measure it

1246.46 --> 1250.69
that's where I immediately draw the line

1248.95 --> 1253.479
because if you can see it then that

1250.69 --> 1255.059
means that it is measurable so that's a

1253.479 --> 1258.729
contradiction in terms

1255.059 --> 1262.049
yes you can measure it by other other

1258.729 --> 1266.47
methods it so this experiment doesn't

1262.049 --> 1269.769
aim to measure the how much the force is

1266.47 --> 1272.739
it does want to show that there is a

1269.769 --> 1274.779
force there that when you put two masses

1272.739 --> 1277.21
close to each other suspending in that

1274.779 --> 1282.159
way they will attract each other and

1277.21 --> 1284.249
that means that all mass attracts it's

1282.159 --> 1289.179
not true it's just not true

1284.249 --> 1291.789
sorry it's a very feeble setup and

1289.179 --> 1294.3090000000002
always has been it's extremely difficult

1291.789 --> 1296.139
to isolate the independent variables

1294.309 --> 1299.2
because of all the influence even

1296.139 --> 1302.379
electrostatics material-wise the entire

1299.2 --> 1305.019
Cavendish setup has never ever being

1302.379 --> 1306.9699999999998
properly isolated in its independent

1305.019 --> 1310.659
variable that's why it's always been a

1306.97 --> 1314.769
giant mess and always been as good as

1310.659 --> 1317.499
impossible to get the actual effect

1314.769 --> 1320.6490000000001
completely isolated and consistent

1317.499 --> 1323.919
that's why the results of the Cavendish

1320.649 --> 1328.09
are never conclusively in one direction

1323.919 --> 1330.8490000000002
never ever it's always going to be mixed

1328.09 --> 1334.33
results always will be no matter what

1330.849 --> 1337.299
type of setup you have because it's not

1334.33 --> 1338.9189999999999
caused by gravity yes it does not

1337.299 --> 1340.869
attract one another there's so many

1338.919 --> 1343.779
other effects out there that do have

1340.869 --> 1345.549
very measurable influence and it's very

1343.779 --> 1348.549
tough to keep them out of a setup like

1345.549 --> 1351.299
this or technically it's just impossible

1348.549 --> 1354.429
anyway thanks again mind-warped for the

1351.299 --> 1357.46
25 australian dollars superjet donation

1354.429 --> 1361.1490000000001
i feel generous hahaha just make it

1357.46 --> 1364.179
fifty spreading the law of paying

1361.149 --> 1366.56
forward well thank you I hope I am a

1364.179 --> 1369.8600000000001
good investment

1366.56 --> 1376.4299999999998
sorry heal got cut off there for a

1369.86 --> 1380.87
second yeah I was I want to say so you

1376.43 --> 1383.1200000000001
think that in the video for example that

1380.87 --> 1388.9299999999998
I sent you I never

1383.12 --> 1393.4399999999998
he places the huge balls near the far

1388.93 --> 1396.17
that it's a coincidence that exactly

1393.44 --> 1399.02
that time the bar starts moving more

1396.17 --> 1402.89
rapidly yeah absolutely

1399.02 --> 1404.84
how can you say very simple how can you

1402.89 --> 1407.39
claim that it has to be gravity when

1404.84 --> 1409.8799999999999
there's not even actual proof of it

1407.39 --> 1411.76
according to your own science it's oh

1409.88 --> 1414.17
it's just a story talking around it

1411.76 --> 1416.15
claiming that it's not a force than it

1414.17 --> 1418.6100000000001
is a force then it's insignificant force

1416.15 --> 1422.42
then it's only an apparent force it's

1418.61 --> 1425.2099999999998
not actually real so you don't even know

1422.42 --> 1428.63
what it is or at least what that group

1425.21 --> 1436.25
you're counting on to basically dictate

1428.63 --> 1440.39
what it is they don't know but I know

1436.25 --> 1443.63
also that it's not a coincidence that

1440.39 --> 1450.41
every time you place the balls it moves

1443.63 --> 1452.66
and whenever you remove the balls have

1450.41 --> 1455.26
you ever put two drops together right

1452.66 --> 1457.94
away drops of water next to one another

1455.26 --> 1459.8
yeah have you ever noticed that if they

1457.94 --> 1462.3500000000001
touch they suddenly start to pull

1459.8 --> 1464.3
towards one another yeah right and

1462.35 --> 1467.3
that's called surface tension right

1464.3 --> 1469.43
that's it always happens right every

1467.3 --> 1471.32
single time no matter what the sizes of

1469.43 --> 1473.39
the drops are unless they are huge and

1471.32 --> 1475.25
then mass becomes too much for a surface

1473.39 --> 1476.8000000000002
tension to actually affect it it's

1475.25 --> 1481.34
always there right

1476.8 --> 1483.71
so do you know for example that there's

1481.34 --> 1488.06
other effects also that that do this for

1483.71 --> 1490.22
example certain types of fabric and dust

1488.06 --> 1491.99
that dust will always start pulling

1490.22 --> 1496.49
towards it because it has a static

1491.99 --> 1499.2
charge right always does that unless

1496.49 --> 1501.72
it's like perfectly discharged

1499.2 --> 1503.13
and then even it will be some some

1501.72 --> 1504.93
affected like this well these are

1503.13 --> 1507.99
persistent things that will always keep

1504.93 --> 1510.63
on working so if these are all

1507.99 --> 1513.71
persistent effects that we all deal with

1510.63 --> 1516.5700000000002
as matter itself then how can you

1513.71 --> 1519.63
possibly think that you are capable of

1516.57 --> 1521.6399999999999
perfectly isolating these supposed

1519.63 --> 1525.69
gravity as an independent verb when a

1521.64 --> 1528.3000000000002
setup like the Cavendish setup when all

1525.69 --> 1530.94
these other effects all cost typically

1528.3 --> 1533.6599999999999
matter to be attracted in some way to

1530.94 --> 1533.66
other matter

1534.89 --> 1540.5400000000002
definitely not caused by gravity but by

1537.36 --> 1542.25
the actual effects of the matter and the

1540.54 --> 1546.33
side effects of it themselves like

1542.25 --> 1550.71
static pull surface tension all these

1546.33 --> 1553.8899999999999
things it's certainly not the force that

1550.71 --> 1559.3500000000001
pulls the drugs together now really I

1553.89 --> 1562.65
would I think if it was so do you argue

1559.35 --> 1565.98
that it's like the effect we see of the

1562.65 --> 1570.3200000000002
road moving further away when the powers

1565.98 --> 1573.42
are there it's because magnet is no

1570.32 --> 1575.8799999999999
electrics or what well static charge

1573.42 --> 1577.8300000000002
yeah it's one of the independent it's

1575.88 --> 1580.0800000000002
one of the effects that it would have to

1577.83 --> 1581.6399999999999
be a completely perfectly isolated I

1580.08 --> 1584.1899999999998
don't know if that's even technically

1581.64 --> 1585.66
possible the same counts for all the

1584.19 --> 1588.06
other effect it's just one of the

1585.66 --> 1590.8200000000002
effects the motion could have been

1588.06 --> 1593.76
caused by a wide variety of things

1590.82 --> 1596.34
including slight air displacement

1593.76 --> 1600.27
because the entire setup has been made

1596.34 --> 1604.9099999999999
to be in like frictionless so anything

1600.27 --> 1609.51
could move it anything including slight

1604.91 --> 1614.6100000000001
displacement of air static charge a lot

1609.51 --> 1623.61
of things very easily so or could just

1614.61 --> 1625.1999999999998
do nothing to sit there and when there

1623.61 --> 1628.4099999999999
are no masses is not gonna do anything

1625.2 --> 1631.5
because there's not any weight to it at

1628.41 --> 1632.94
all so there's nothing gonna happen yeah

1631.5 --> 1634.999
either way

1632.94 --> 1640.019
there's nothing to pour to any direction

1634.999 --> 1644.58
but for any reason so if you place the

1640.019 --> 1648.84
masses and well I think we're talking

1644.58 --> 1651.299
over at the same point but I guess I

1648.84 --> 1655.08
can't understand how you say it's just a

1651.299 --> 1656.94
coincidence when it's clearly now when

1655.08 --> 1659.399
when I said it's a coincidence

1656.94 --> 1661.409
I was basically opposing the monolithic

1659.399 --> 1666.6589999999999
claim that it could only be caused by

1661.409 --> 1669.509
gravity when I just explained how how

1666.659 --> 1671.5800000000002
much it's probably not caused by gravity

1669.509 --> 1674.669
because there is such a wide variety of

1671.58 --> 1677.369
effects that are as good as impossible

1674.669 --> 1679.739
to even isolate in this setup that could

1677.369 --> 1685.1689999999999
be causing that minor displacement in

1679.739 --> 1688.489
that very feeble setup yeah you doubt it

1685.169 --> 1692.22
yeah I have doubts about a lot of things

1688.489 --> 1695.249
but the problem is doubts it could be

1692.22 --> 1697.3790000000001
the problem is it could be and you can't

1695.249 --> 1708.299
properly isolate it not in this feeble

1697.379 --> 1709.4699999999998
set up pull the mastic I don't know what

1708.299 --> 1712.229
exactly

1709.47 --> 1714.529
specifically caused that effect but I'm

1712.229 --> 1718.3790000000001
pretty sure it's not gonna be gravity

1714.529 --> 1721.979
well because gravity doesn't exist it's

1718.379 --> 1728.6689999999999
a fictional apparent force by the

1721.979 --> 1731.099
official definition oh yeah tiring isn't

1728.669 --> 1740.5800000000002
it when your own narrative contradict

1731.099 --> 1743.279
you I think it's mind-blowing that we

1740.58 --> 1748.139
can argue over something that we both

1743.279 --> 1751.59
see and one of us believes something

1748.139 --> 1756.119
completely different but with we're both

1751.59 --> 1759.2389999999998
seeing the same thing I know it's very

1756.119 --> 1762.83
easy you just follow a different train

1759.239 --> 1766.29
of thought and presuppose other things

1762.83 --> 1768.36
yes sir right

1766.29 --> 1770.58
I'm simply trying to be honest and look

1768.36 --> 1773.07
at the setup and just look at why was

1770.58 --> 1776.34
created in the first place I'm doing the

1773.07 --> 1783.72
same thing do you have any doubts about

1776.34 --> 1786.3899999999999
that about what did you say I like I pre

1783.72 --> 1789.72
supporting but you have to accept that

1786.39 --> 1792.3300000000002
that's what you do as well you don't

1789.72 --> 1795.059
come out of nowhere you you as well have

1792.33 --> 1802.47
some presuppositions that you can't get

1795.059 --> 1802.95
rid of your mind in your day no no not

1802.47 --> 1806.22
really

1802.95 --> 1809.07
but the more you have to give up certain

1806.22 --> 1814.28
trains of thought that are very fast and

1809.07 --> 1816.9289999999999
complex and satisfying to wield the more

1814.28 --> 1821.6689999999999
depressing it becomes that is something

1816.929 --> 1825.0590000000002
that I do have to admit accepting that

1821.669 --> 1827.8200000000002
you know a lot of that you know that you

1825.059 --> 1829.799
know that you don't know a lot of things

1827.82 --> 1833.52
that you have certainty about not

1829.799 --> 1836.04
knowing a lot of things that is not a

1833.52 --> 1837.6
pleasant thing to go through and it'll

1836.04 --> 1839.97
only get worse and I know that's gonna

1837.6 --> 1841.7099999999998
happen but I have to do it because

1839.97 --> 1843.69
otherwise I'll just get stuck in dreams

1841.71 --> 1845.3700000000001
and then eventually grow around those

1843.69 --> 1849.45
dreams and no longer have an actual

1845.37 --> 1851.4899999999998
critically thinking mind and I don't

1849.45 --> 1860.51
think it's such an unpleasant experience

1851.49 --> 1863.429
like for me not knowing things you say

1860.51 --> 1865.95
you don't know you don't know something

1863.429 --> 1867.9
until you find out that you definitely

1865.95 --> 1870.75
don't know even though you automatically

1867.9 --> 1873.27
assumed you did all your life that's the

1870.75 --> 1875.309
real thing I'm talking about when you

1873.27 --> 1877.35
figure out oh [ __ ] yeah I've always been

1875.309 --> 1879.75
told that freaking light is a like a

1877.35 --> 1880.9189999999999
piece of matter that has a speed and

1879.75 --> 1883.14
there's all these things in quantum

1880.919 --> 1885.69
mechanics and then I figure out holy

1883.14 --> 1888.0300000000002
[ __ ] that first free supposition could

1885.69 --> 1892.01
have been a lie from the beginning that

1888.03 --> 1892.01
spawned all of this science fiction

1892.58 --> 1898.359
further trying to muddy the waters

1896.169 --> 1905.7990000000002
of understanding and that's what I have

1898.359 --> 1914.1999999999998
to deal with and it is challenging but

1905.799 --> 1917.32
it's also very tiresome I wonder how how

1914.2 --> 1919.779
Nathan is able to do that every day

1917.32 --> 1923.739
every single day to ask the same

1919.779 --> 1926.789
questions and get the same answers well

1923.739 --> 1932.529
how does a teacher do class every day

1926.789 --> 1935.98
for decades it's a routine it's knowing

1932.529 --> 1938.32
what you're talking about knowing what

1935.98 --> 1940.059
the responses will be by having seen

1938.32 --> 1942.1589999999999
them over and over and over again and

1940.059 --> 1944.559
then being able to size up those

1942.159 --> 1946.749
responses in order to respond perfectly

1944.559 --> 1950.049
that's what Nathan has been doing it's

1946.749 --> 1963.869
just been like running a class an online

1950.049 --> 1966.609
live class in a very rough way yes yes

1963.869 --> 1969.4599999999998
the things that he does claim he knows

1966.609 --> 1971.859
he talks he knows he's talking about yes

1969.46 --> 1975.1290000000001
he does and he's very clear about what

1971.859 --> 1977.9189999999999
he doesn't understand he's I love it

1975.129 --> 1979.629
I do it myself and he does it too and I

1977.919 --> 1981.5490000000002
respect that a lot because he's been

1979.629 --> 1985.269
very persistent with it and has become

1981.549 --> 1987.1
better at it also Nathan knows very well

1985.269 --> 1993.039
what he knows and what he does not know

1987.1 --> 1999.009
I think I don't know for sure but I

1993.039 --> 2009.179
think so so far yeah to me it's kind of

1999.009 --> 2012.119
I only was the soul but sometimes I get

2009.179 --> 2016.3790000000001
really mad when when he starts shouting

2012.119 --> 2019.649
at people but like other times I can

2016.379 --> 2023.73
understand too when people like Brett

2019.649 --> 2026.5189999999998
for example sometimes I don't know

2023.73 --> 2029.76
sometimes Boehner seems just as crazy as

2026.519 --> 2032.73
nature you know other cops

2029.76 --> 2036.03
well some people actually come to the

2032.73 --> 2039.3600000000001
debates specifically to watch other

2036.03 --> 2040.43
people get pissed off at blowers for

2039.36 --> 2044.1599999999999
their idiocy

2040.43 --> 2046.05
because there's a lot of people a huge

2044.16 --> 2048.6
amount of flat earthers out there that

2046.05 --> 2052.55
have to face people like these and they

2048.6 --> 2055.11
don't have been the communication skills

2052.55 --> 2057.1800000000003
sufficient enough to actually do a

2055.11 --> 2059.88
proper response so they walk away from

2057.18 --> 2063.8399999999997
it and build up that frustration Nathan

2059.88 --> 2065.7000000000003
is basically doing it for everyone and

2063.84 --> 2067.77
there's a lot of people rejoicing over

2065.7 --> 2071.7599999999998
it like it finally somebody putting that

2067.77 --> 2075.21
stupid [ __ ] in place for real in a real

2071.76 --> 2077.07
way and that's that's really what a lot

2075.21 --> 2079.11
of people like about Nathan and what he

2077.07 --> 2081.54
does and then of course other people

2079.11 --> 2085.6200000000003
that are really much more interested in

2081.54 --> 2088.5299999999997
the in the actual real science detail

2085.62 --> 2090.6
the information they will not like that

2088.53 --> 2092.82
they will really like more the the

2090.6 --> 2096.06
trains of thought and reasoning and in

2092.82 --> 2098.4
the technical aspects of the debate so

2096.06 --> 2104.99
there's multiple sides to what makes

2098.4 --> 2111.06
Nathan's show run the way it does yeah I

2104.99 --> 2119.31
guess if you want to talk about one more

2111.06 --> 2126.87
subject which is curvature okay Nathan

2119.31 --> 2130.77
say a lot of times if the earth was a

2126.87 --> 2133.67
sphere when you were on top of it you

2130.77 --> 2133.67
could see the curvature

2137.47 --> 2144.069
have you ever seen that demonstrated in

2141.04 --> 2147.7799999999997
models no in 3d animated models that

2144.069 --> 2150.7
include optics yeah it would

2147.78 --> 2153.13
that's just natural consequences it's

2150.7 --> 2157.81
not even BAE it's not even bound by Auto

2153.13 --> 2163.3900000000003
graphic view or anything you would do

2157.81 --> 2167.68
you agree that if you were imagine that

2163.39 --> 2171.25
you're standing on a ball that gets that

2167.68 --> 2175.24
can get larger and larger do you think

2171.25 --> 2178.81
that there is a point when it gets so

2175.24 --> 2180.8799999999997
large compared to you that when you're

2178.81 --> 2183.099
on the top of it everything around you

2180.88 --> 2193.359
seems flat do you agree with that or no

2183.099 --> 2198.869
nope absolutely not nope you'll see a

2193.359 --> 2205.48
curve of any kind except if the earth is

2198.869 --> 2209.17
much much bigger the ball then any globe

2205.48 --> 2212.109
has ever been suggested to be that case

2209.17 --> 2214.839
yeah could be could be presenting as

2212.109 --> 2217.99
flat but that's not the setup that the

2214.839 --> 2220.24
globe is suggesting at all and this

2217.99 --> 2224.97
globe of the presumed size would

2220.24 --> 2228.7599999999998
absolutely be visible absolutely

2224.97 --> 2232.39
unmistakably so so you agree with my

2228.76 --> 2235.0
first statement that way above a certain

2232.39 --> 2240.52
point that huge huge point if you say

2235.0 --> 2242.77
you fancy yeah it's a very much

2240.52 --> 2245.95
presuppositional question but yes if the

2242.77 --> 2248.68
earth would be a ball much much faster

2245.95 --> 2251.14
than it is pre supposed to be yeah then

2248.68 --> 2251.89
at some point you would not be able to

2251.14 --> 2253.54
see it anymore

2251.89 --> 2255.97
well guess what nobody's suggesting

2253.54 --> 2257.73
that's the case so that's a hypothetical

2255.97 --> 2260.5299999999997
question that doesn't lead anywhere

2257.73 --> 2263.67
because it's not the curve that is

2260.53 --> 2263.67
presumed to be there

2270.25 --> 2275.08
think that is the the argument people

2272.8 --> 2277.96
make when they say that you can't see

2275.08 --> 2281.83
care they care from the top of the air

2277.96 --> 2284.4700000000003
because it's so insanely huge compared

2281.83 --> 2287.08
to you that it just bounces and you see

2284.47 --> 2290.77
every flood I think that's the that's

2287.08 --> 2292.48
what they are saying they're saying a

2290.77 --> 2295.62
lot of things but it doesn't make any

2292.48 --> 2298.6
damn sense because it's just not

2295.62 --> 2301.2
emulation software I don't know where

2298.6 --> 2304.93
you can see that what you're saying that

2301.2 --> 2306.79
the perspective of of a person that

2304.93 --> 2311.5299999999997
stands on top of a boat do you know of

2306.79 --> 2315.49
any sites where I've seen simulations

2311.53 --> 2317.59
did to do that yeah I've seen games that

2315.49 --> 2319.99
actually tried that that were extremely

2317.59 --> 2326.8
unsuccessful because it nauseated the

2319.99 --> 2331.08
players because that's not real and your

2326.8 --> 2331.0800000000004
intuition catches on very quickly

2335.37 --> 2341.3399999999997
all right google it I guess thank you

2338.25 --> 2342.54
for yeah thank you for coming I got a

2341.34 --> 2347.28
little bit rough here and there

2342.54 --> 2349.59
sometimes I hope you don't mind but you

2347.28 --> 2354.6600000000003
were overall good sports and had some

2349.59 --> 2358.56
good questions so I appreciate that see

2354.66 --> 2363.87
Jim Beam is it where are you from if I

2358.56 --> 2366.33
may ask by the way are you okay so

2363.87 --> 2373.68
you're a Greek and you live in the UK

2366.33 --> 2381.65
yeah all right okay well thanks yes yeah

2373.68 --> 2386.58
all right thanks for coming man hmm okay

2381.65 --> 2401.9700000000003
that was that was interesting I hope you

2386.58 --> 2404.04
thought did well yeah I have to be

2401.97 --> 2406.35
careful there's nothing to lose my voice

2404.04 --> 2411.63
at some point because it does really

2406.35 --> 2415.49
feel rough right now hey hey a plane an

2411.63 --> 2415.4900000000002
anchor just added me on skype hello

2420.869 --> 2431.1600000000003
hmm okay Nathan's already thrown out to

2427.839 --> 2434.2
hang out link or the Flat Earth debates

2431.16 --> 2439.2
huh I've noticed there has been some

2434.2 --> 2439.2
trolls in chat not nothing too bad

2456.64 --> 2462.259
mm but yeah I need a bit of a brick

2460.309 --> 2464.9
talking mice

2462.259 --> 2466.579
I actually thought of just not doing the

2464.9 --> 2470.359
show today because my thread really

2466.579 --> 2473.42
feels like Oh starting to feel like

2470.359 --> 2476.299
somebody's like like I'm being forced

2473.42 --> 2478.64
like Darth Vader is like very very

2476.299 --> 2479.15
slowly trying to force choke me or

2478.64 --> 2484.009
something

2479.15 --> 2495.17
that's what it feels like right now but

2484.009 --> 2498.73
he's doing it extremely slowly luckily I

2495.17 --> 2498.73
can still breathe properly though

2506.39 --> 2513.779
right oh yeah talking about interactions

2510.359 --> 2517.5
with Glover's that somebody see my my

2513.779 --> 2519.48
one-on-one yesterday at Jose's and was

2517.5 --> 2520.4
pretty interesting until I just got sick

2519.48 --> 2523.289
of it

2520.4 --> 2525.15
because the guy the submarine guy I

2523.289 --> 2528.329
don't even remember his name and just it

2525.15 --> 2531.619
was a really good elaborate discussion

2528.329 --> 2534.569
about the nature of the heavenly bodies

2531.619 --> 2537.98
from a holographic perspective where you

2534.569 --> 2540.9
really hurt me out and from the

2537.98 --> 2543.359
conclusion as to where the physical

2540.9 --> 2545.549
nature conclusion was derived from and

2543.359 --> 2547.859
it was really good I really appreciated

2545.549 --> 2550.65
it it's good enough for me to download

2547.859 --> 2552.39
and just take separately but then

2550.65 --> 2554.099
eventually you moved on like yeah it's

2552.39 --> 2556.5
are really nice but there's no field

2554.099 --> 2560.309
proof of physicality and besides the

2556.5 --> 2563.069
earth is flat not curved and then just

2560.309 --> 2564.809
the second I knew what he was gonna eat

2563.069 --> 2567.329
was basically drawing you know it's a

2564.809 --> 2570.15
graphic for you to prove to me well it

2567.329 --> 2571.8590000000004
can't be look no too graphic whew it's a

2570.15 --> 2573.059
straight line you don't see the

2571.859 --> 2575.13
concealment

2573.059 --> 2577.65
I knew he was gonna do that and it just

2575.13 --> 2581.069
got so sick of it and it just said like

2577.65 --> 2583.5
a screw that I'm not gonna be subjected

2581.069 --> 2587.329
to that level of retardation after all

2583.5 --> 2587.329
of this I'm just not gonna do that

2599.97 --> 2608.1699999999996
yes I do rationality sensible soft role

2604.78 --> 2612.76
of somebody out there it's not a slice

2608.17 --> 2618.25
of the real world it's a geometrical non

2612.76 --> 2622.53
optics elements included representation

2618.25 --> 2624.76
it's not optical it's not visual

2622.53 --> 2629.07
compatible because it was never designed

2624.76 --> 2633.07
for that it uses actual sizes not

2629.07 --> 2636.2200000000003
angular sizes it does not apply visual

2633.07 --> 2638.5
phenomena can't emulate that it misses

2636.22 --> 2641.97
the correct elements for it because it's

2638.5 --> 2646.12
an autograph you and not an actual

2641.97 --> 2649.62
visual optics based view so I know

2646.12 --> 2649.62
exactly what that is

2669.35 --> 2675.45
yeah yeah look look yeah I'm letting

2673.05 --> 2678.8100000000004
Jason back in my chat because he stopped

2675.45 --> 2681.54
capturing and because he can just act

2678.81 --> 2684.81
like a normal person now so I have no

2681.54 --> 2688.65
more objections to that but yeah Lottie

2684.81 --> 2691.38
is just still doing his [ __ ] troll

2688.65 --> 2693.9
spam [ __ ] everywhere trying to get my

2691.38 --> 2697.44
attention that simply means that I will

2693.9 --> 2700.4100000000003
never unlock you you know what's gonna

2697.44 --> 2703.9700000000003
happen at best is I'm gonna up the price

2700.41 --> 2707.49
for your unbanning even more and more

2703.97 --> 2711.1499999999996
until it will simply never be done and

2707.49 --> 2714.1499999999996
you will simply never be an official

2711.15 --> 2716.13
part of my chat again so it's all

2714.15 --> 2718.859
whatever you want if you want to be that

2716.13 --> 2720.7200000000003
troll Lottie then keep on going doing

2718.859 --> 2722.49
the same [ __ ] over and over again but if

2720.72 --> 2724.68
you actually just want to act like a

2722.49 --> 2726.6
normal person again and perhaps have a

2724.68 --> 2728.85
conversation with somebody in my chat

2726.6 --> 2731.24
then you're gonna have to stop doing

2728.85 --> 2731.24
what you're doing

2735.5 --> 2744.42
that's lovely mr. rant rancidity

2740.16 --> 2746.3689999999997
acidity or rancidity you right so of a

2744.42 --> 2749.1
orthographic view does work it's

2746.369 --> 2751.29
excellent it's so handy especially once

2749.1 --> 2754.5299999999997
when you want to like design things

2751.29 --> 2756.57
build construct where you really need to

2754.53 --> 2758.5800000000004
know the actual size of things and all

2756.57 --> 2763.7400000000002
that it's really useful it definitely

2758.58 --> 2767.25
works however it does not work when

2763.74 --> 2772.68
you're trying to calculate or predict

2767.25 --> 2775.56
things that concern viewing functions

2772.68 --> 2779.0899999999997
because when you use viewing functions

2775.56 --> 2782.91
there are other things that play optics

2779.09 --> 2786.51
perspective diffraction a lot of things

2782.91 --> 2788.96
huge range of things that are too

2786.51 --> 2792.6000000000004
graphic view does not and cannot ever

2788.96 --> 2795.2400000000002
include so yeah it's really useful to to

2792.6 --> 2797.52
use an orthographic view except for when

2795.24 --> 2800.5699999999997
you want to try to predict or calculate

2797.52 --> 2800.57
a viewing function

2805.91 --> 2809.0899999999997
[Music]

2815.26 --> 2819.8500000000004
no thanks random explore

2848.859 --> 2853.089
right yeah mind-warped I'd like to

2851.41 --> 2855.8999999999996
address that for a moment because yeah

2853.089 --> 2858.7889999999998
you're a good person it's very close and

2855.9 --> 2864.7290000000003
what you're saying about Kiwi I kind of

2858.789 --> 2868.329
agree to call him overbearing I I'd

2864.729 --> 2871.8689999999997
rather think that Huey has a lot of very

2868.329 --> 2874.259
correct knowledge but because of his

2871.869 --> 2877.3900000000003
overbearing personal nature

2874.259 --> 2879.7
he's just attacking a lot and he's

2877.39 --> 2885.819
basically excessive he's very aggressive

2879.7 --> 2889.799
in his argumentation beyond reason

2885.819 --> 2893.319
ability and that that is I think because

2889.799 --> 2897.099
he needs to because at the same time he

2893.319 --> 2899.019
doesn't have full hand oversight control

2897.099 --> 2902.44
over the knowledge and he does deal with

2899.019 --> 2904.8089999999997
in absolute perfection so there's like

2902.44 --> 2907.15
this automatic need to get keep it

2904.809 --> 2910.029
somewhat to keep it into his hand and

2907.15 --> 2912.9100000000003
that might be subconscious or it might

2910.029 --> 2915.94
be really like a secret mission I don't

2912.91 --> 2920.499
know we'll find out one way or the other

2915.94 --> 2924.789
anyway it doesn't really matter but yeah

2920.499 --> 2929.14
as for the technical information that QE

2924.789 --> 2933.849
deals in it is useful the way he

2929.14 --> 2936.999
presents it the way he deals with it not

2933.849 --> 2939.7290000000003
so much to me that's why yeah sorry guys

2936.999 --> 2944.279
but I just really don't like sitting

2939.729 --> 2947.64
through QE presentations I really do not

2944.279 --> 2947.64
that's just

2948.69 --> 2954.539
I get the concept most of them I do not

2952.23 --> 2957.63
agree with all of it I don't like to be

2954.539 --> 2962.13
overly emphasizing of certain angles the

2957.63 --> 2964.38
things but yeah when QE is correct about

2962.13 --> 2966.92
something then he is correct about

2964.38 --> 2971.1600000000003
something and I'm gonna support that

2966.92 --> 2973.38
even if I don't like it and if there are

2971.16 --> 2976.14
things that I don't fully agree with

2973.38 --> 2979.829
then I will out speak out my doubts and

2976.14 --> 2983.8089999999997
basically approach is approach to it as

2979.829 --> 2987.119
a minor presuppositional a minor

2983.809 --> 2989.369
presumption that I don't agree with that

2987.119 --> 2992.46
I can still go with even though I don't

2989.369 --> 2996.349
like it and don't fully agree to it and

2992.46 --> 2996.349
that's just the way it works

3006.68 --> 3015.5
to see it like this no matter how

3011.23 --> 3019.1
terrible or unbearable a person can be

3015.5 --> 3024.17
in their conduct that does not mean that

3019.1 --> 3025.9
they are automatically wrong and the

3024.17 --> 3029.0
same goes for the other way around

3025.9 --> 3032.39
no matter how nice and flattering and

3029.0 --> 3035.54
well-spoken and smooth and comforting

3032.39 --> 3038.48
and appealing somebody can speak doesn't

3035.54 --> 3041.0
make what they say the actual content or

3038.48 --> 3046.4900000000002
the ideas are the concepts correct or

3041.0 --> 3049.72
rational so you have to take both the

3046.49 --> 3049.72
elements for what they are

3066.45 --> 3069.6699999999996
[Applause]

3077.89 --> 3080.89
yeah

3087.53 --> 3090.19
yep

3091.85 --> 3100.67
nine point eight miles per second square

3096.5 --> 3106.52
why does square well the square is an

3100.67 --> 3111.05
attempt to geomet geo mathematically

3106.52 --> 3115.34
mathematically replace a a circle curve

3111.05 --> 3116.57
function so it's basically the ninety

3115.34 --> 3120.44
point eight miles

3116.57 --> 3122.3900000000003
wait no no way that's the the

3120.44 --> 3124.88
acceleration rate I thought you were

3122.39 --> 3136.69
talking about that the curvature

3124.88 --> 3136.69
calculate that will be larious

3137.95 --> 3147.6699999999996
like the falling rates of things proves

3142.299 --> 3150.7599999999998
the curvature no let's not even go there

3147.67 --> 3154.4700000000003
maybe one day if I'm like really in the

3150.76 --> 3158.26
mood to confuse some globe thinkers

3154.47 --> 3162.49
right but look the whole 9.8 meters per

3158.26 --> 3166.2400000000002
second square acceleration rate that's a

3162.49 --> 3169.39
deduction that is based on just what

3166.24 --> 3172.2099999999996
happens it doesn't mean anything the

3169.39 --> 3176.049
acceleration rate does not prove there

3172.21 --> 3180.88
is a gravity force what the acceleration

3176.049 --> 3183.549
rate is basically how much things

3180.88 --> 3187.329
naturally displace due to relative

3183.549 --> 3189.49
density disequilibrium and it is

3187.329 --> 3191.77
translated yeah it's basically

3189.49 --> 3195.22
everything that does it scribe to

3191.77 --> 3198.13
gravity without any solid proof - it can

3195.22 --> 3201.819
just be moved over to a relative density

3198.13 --> 3205.9
where it will have a good spot with a

3201.819 --> 3208.839
solid foundation so yeah the full

3205.9 --> 3211.63
acceleration rate is simply caused is a

3208.839 --> 3213.339
displacement is a force manifested

3211.63 --> 3214.9300000000003
caused by a relative density

3213.339 --> 3219.869
disequilibrium of an off the object

3214.93 --> 3223.5299999999997
within its medium it's directly provable

3219.869 --> 3227.94
trial-and-error caused enough effects

3223.53 --> 3227.94
scientific experiment all of it

3232.43 --> 3235.66
[Music]

3236.119 --> 3241.88
right Henry Cavendish yeah the thing is

3238.709 --> 3245.609
about terminal velocity

3241.88 --> 3248.9990000000003
terminal velocity does not exist in a

3245.609 --> 3254.16
theoretical vacuum because the terminal

3248.999 --> 3258.269
velocity is specifically bound by the

3254.16 --> 3260.279
density of the medium and if there is

3258.269 --> 3262.2
none if there is no material to

3260.279 --> 3264.809
basically give that friction then there

3262.2 --> 3267.359
will be no terminal velocity because

3264.809 --> 3270.4500000000003
terminal velocity is specifically

3267.359 --> 3273.66
determined by the friction of the medium

3270.45 --> 3281.8489999999997
and object is displacing through due to

3273.66 --> 3287.999
relative density base equilibria in the

3281.849 --> 3291.239
square Y the squares it's just a concept

3287.999 --> 3293.549
it's it's square is multiplying by

3291.239 --> 3295.95
itself it entered you it's a calculus

3293.549 --> 3301.349
effect it introduces an exponential

3295.95 --> 3304.709
factor where as linear steps progress

3301.349 --> 3307.6800000000003
the quantity starts to build up

3304.709 --> 3309.799
exponentially so instead of a linear

3307.68 --> 3311.91
linear effect there's a linear

3309.799 --> 3319.069
exponential effect that's what the

3311.91 --> 3319.069
squared element does it's mathematical

3331.76 --> 3336.639
[Music]

3349.09 --> 3356.76
no no you don't have any Cavendish you

3353.35 --> 3356.7599999999998
don't it's not true

3370.26 --> 3373.07
no wait

3374.199 --> 3378.609
dancer things falling further yeah

3378.909 --> 3386.779
dancer things yeah well technically if

3383.539 --> 3389.329
it is dancer if it is more compact then

3386.779 --> 3392.119
the relative density this equilibrium

3389.329 --> 3395.799
between it and it's medium will even be

3392.119 --> 3400.9990000000003
greater so I guess yes it will

3395.799 --> 3404.109
accelerate faster it will resist the air

3400.999 --> 3406.459
friction or medium friction more

3404.109 --> 3410.589
dramatically because of the relative

3406.459 --> 3410.589
density this equilibrium

3418.71 --> 3421.82
[Music]

3431.49 --> 3435.3089999999997
but

3433.089 --> 3440.439
why don't we square the measure of

3435.309 --> 3444.699
something accelerating horizontally the

3440.439 --> 3447.8799999999997
hold on you do you do do that how do you

3444.699 --> 3450.309
think acceleration rate of engines cars

3447.88 --> 3462.659
are made that's exactly what happens

3450.309 --> 3462.659
acceleration rate is squared it is

3468.68 --> 3477.7
like force manifests through

3472.9 --> 3482.69
displacement and with maneuverability

3477.7 --> 3485.21
yeah provided the displacement will

3482.69 --> 3487.4900000000002
express itself in from a standstill

3485.21 --> 3489.68
point into an acceleration rate which

3487.49 --> 3494.2
will be squared basically that's just

3489.68 --> 3499.0
how acceleration works it's an odd

3494.2 --> 3499.0
mathematical pattern coincidence

3502.08 --> 3505.23
[Music]

3512.76 --> 3525.8900000000003
Thank You Amanda you doing my best corn

3523.44 --> 3525.89
rolls

3538.429 --> 3546.239
right things have gone long enough I'm

3544.92 --> 3550.069
think I'm gonna round that to show I've

3546.239 --> 3554.609
been going there for almost an hour yeah

3550.069 --> 3557.279
my voice I just need to shut up most of

3554.609 --> 3563.64
the day I think before I lose my voice

3557.279 --> 3567.63
entirely anyway I thought it was a good

3563.64 --> 3569.999
an interesting guest little knowing here

3567.63 --> 3572.4590000000003
and there but not in unexpected ways

3569.999 --> 3575.0389999999998
he didn't Ram it through he seemed to be

3572.459 --> 3577.2889999999998
very honest at least he wasn't trying to

3575.039 --> 3579.779
deceive like Brenda and everything so it

3577.289 --> 3581.9990000000003
was good also after that good

3579.779 --> 3584.969
conversations with chat good questions

3581.999 --> 3588.7389999999996
so thank you everyone that's been part

3584.969 --> 3591.959
of this hangout this early bird number

3588.739 --> 3593.819
238 thank you everyone for coming if you

3591.959 --> 3596.069
liked it as much as I have then please

3593.819 --> 3597.42
don't forget to upload it and if you

3596.069 --> 3598.979
haven't already subscribed to my channel

3597.42 --> 3600.39
and hit the bell notification so you

3598.979 --> 3602.549
know when I'm going live which is

3600.39 --> 3606.15
normally 2:00 p.m. amsterdam time every

3602.549 --> 3607.829
day also hashtag me if i need and please

3606.15 --> 3611.099
do support my channel through the super

3607.829 --> 3618.2690000000002
chats paypal patreon and my GoFundMe and

3611.099 --> 3620.009
i got from what is from mind mind-warped

3618.269 --> 3623.279
got some great super chats today so

3620.009 --> 3627.119
thank you again so much it's really

3623.279 --> 3629.789
encouraging and yes I will be back

3627.119 --> 3633.509
tomorrow with flat earth early bird

3629.789 --> 3635.219
number 239 also gonna join the Flat

3633.509 --> 3637.829
Earth debates right after that it's

3635.219 --> 3641.39
already started up so I hope to see you

3637.829 --> 3645.049
there and until the next video

3641.39 --> 3645.049
keep it flat
