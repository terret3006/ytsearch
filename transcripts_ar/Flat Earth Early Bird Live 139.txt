5.25 --> 36.549
[Music]

60.19 --> 67.61
sorry I forgot it freaking me a good

63.02 --> 68.45
mute button again good morning welcome

67.61 --> 71.72
to Flat Earth

68.45 --> 74.54
early-bird number 139 I'm your host

71.72 --> 79.13
Arwen and today is a lovely spring day

74.54 --> 84.71000000000001
very nice and warm no wind lots of birds

79.13 --> 89.21
everywhere and yeah it's been a joy so I

84.71 --> 93.02
thought so far nope no chemtrails either

89.21 --> 98.36
by the way yeah so yeah it's a nice day

93.02 --> 101.6
and I got a lot of new visitors

98.36 --> 104.39
apparently because just in the recent

101.6 --> 109.25
hours I got spammed by at least a

104.39 --> 111.26
hundred new comments like they just keep

109.25 --> 113.21
on coming I could barely keep track and

111.26 --> 115.45
a lot of them are troll comments I had

113.21 --> 119.0
yeah it was gonna delete them like

115.45 --> 123.619
seriously like pedo [ __ ] and just how

119.0 --> 127.34
[ __ ] i am from for not studying blah

123.619 --> 129.92
blah blah you know how it goes but yeah

127.34 --> 132.47
also just a couple of well new people

129.92 --> 135.58999999999997
were asking genuine questions kind of

132.47 --> 138.44
from a baller perspective but pretty

135.59 --> 140.989
decent sounding so yeah it's it's been

138.44 --> 145.16
interesting a lot of conversation and I

140.989 --> 149.269
got some new subscribers also I seem to

145.16 --> 151.28
have launched up to eleven hundred and

149.269 --> 157.81
seventy nine so that was rather quick

151.28 --> 163.67000000000002
and met some new people in chat earlier

157.81 --> 167.0
brand em somebody called Brenda but not

163.67 --> 169.66
the Brenda that we know in the globe

167.0 --> 169.66
Patrol and

173.51 --> 179.92999999999998
yeah am i UK in chat yeah let's just go

178.01 --> 188.98899999999998
through chat and HM of course and

179.93 --> 192.23000000000002
Voynich they were first W Minogue no

188.989 --> 196.67000000000002
also probably newcomer sounds a tad

192.23 --> 200.92999999999998
trollish but I don't know just yeah

196.67 --> 205.02999999999997
everybody has to get used to new people

200.93 --> 208.459
they find on channel so I get it

205.03 --> 212.51
and yeah censorship it is the talk of

208.459 --> 217.879
the day and yeah I do kind of censor my

212.51 --> 221.66
hangout because I tend to get distracted

217.879 --> 224.42
and I don't want like really vile [ __ ]

221.66 --> 226.849
and accusations going around don't want

224.42 --> 228.76899999999998
that readable I want people to be able

226.849 --> 230.69
to focus on what I have to tell because

228.769 --> 234.47
sometimes it can get a little complex

230.69 --> 238.959
and you don't need all that distraction

234.47 --> 248.78
you just need a good atmosphere and and

238.959 --> 251.84
yeah some space to focus that's alright

248.78 --> 255.139
for a niche just remember the overall

251.84 --> 257.539
rules if somebody has a typical sock

255.139 --> 259.669
account that is really disgusting in its

257.539 --> 263.479
name very obviously they're always the

259.669 --> 267.919
same then outright venom if they're not

263.479 --> 271.789
one of those sock names then I don't

267.919 --> 273.77
know if it's really disgusting just like

271.789 --> 275.68
delete the message or timeout don't ban

273.77 --> 278.79999999999995
anyone just leave the banning to me

275.68 --> 281.90000000000003
except for the disgusting troll names

278.8 --> 283.639
and spammers somebody is obviously

281.9 --> 287.71999999999997
spamming constantly although I think

283.639 --> 291.52
there is a slight delay so that may be

287.72 --> 291.52000000000004
tough for them to try that out anyway

291.76 --> 298.65999999999997
but yeah I like to keep it a little

294.1 --> 304.66
clean here and yeah don't abuse wrenches

298.66 --> 306.82000000000005
in if somebody's if you're in an

304.66 --> 309.19
argument with somebody please but you

306.82 --> 311.95
all know that so yeah good to see all of

309.19 --> 320.65
you lots of new people and familiar

311.95 --> 325.39
faces let me finish going through I was

320.65 --> 327.7
here a GM yeah Aires 106 bill G [ __ ] you

325.39 --> 329.65
Jeffry bill michael roark and glacial

327.7 --> 331.65999999999997
Obama called the plain truth good to see

329.65 --> 334.39
you and avoiding each yeah the rest

331.66 --> 338.83000000000004
seems have left already

334.39 --> 344.22999999999996
I don't know bearish Mike yeah I'm doing

338.83 --> 347.91999999999996
good a bit of a annoying morning though

344.23 --> 353.20000000000005
but there's some hassle with my

347.92 --> 356.26
landlords being an ass again making

353.2 --> 358.12
things very impractical but yeah I don't

356.26 --> 361.21
know there may be solution yeah it has

358.12 --> 362.83
to do with my internet connection and so

361.21 --> 365.2
far yeah you've noticed those who've

362.83 --> 369.01
been watching my show the recent

365.2 --> 371.71
episodes sometimes the stream gets

369.01 --> 375.19
interrupted and because of the

371.71 --> 376.93
connection of my landline that goes

375.19 --> 379.96
through the electricity net sometimes it

376.93 --> 382.48
glitches that I have to quickly you have

379.96 --> 384.19
reset it and that usually works but

382.48 --> 386.89000000000004
sometimes it doesn't work and I have to

384.19 --> 390.73
actually pull out the other side and

386.89 --> 392.16999999999996
that side is not in my room it's in

390.73 --> 394.24
somebody else's room and they're not

392.17 --> 395.8
always at home or like it's in the

394.24 --> 398.44
middle of the night and yeah I'm not

395.8 --> 401.17
gonna wake them up for that and to solve

398.44 --> 406.23
that problem I had the capability to

401.17 --> 407.83000000000004
basically reset the electricity just

406.23 --> 410.29
click-clack

407.83 --> 413.32
yeah no big trouble really

410.29 --> 415.42
most people are just using their mobiles

413.32 --> 417.73
there's not a lot of heavy equipment and

415.42 --> 420.46000000000004
that's all in the kitchen anyway so I

417.73 --> 423.01
yeah it's doable but my landlord doesn't

420.46 --> 425.68
like it so he locked it up and this this

423.01 --> 429.94
is stupid because now if something goes

425.68 --> 431.71
wrong in the kitchen or whatever yeah if

429.94 --> 433.87
the electricity goes off we actually

431.71 --> 435.46
have to freakin call him and wait for

433.87 --> 437.14
him to come while we could be in the

435.46 --> 442.63
middle of cooking and everything it's

437.14 --> 446.11
just needy otic so it's just annoying

442.63 --> 450.21999999999997
landlord stuff but yeah we'll get out of

446.11 --> 452.92
it I already suggested to him how to

450.22 --> 454.90000000000003
change it but apparently if it costs him

452.92 --> 456.88
any money he's not gonna do anything so

454.9 --> 459.37
I think he's sort of back handedly

456.88 --> 462.15999999999997
green-lighted me to just okay if you're

459.37 --> 463.36
gonna pay for it you do it and then I'll

462.16 --> 466.09000000000003
just let you do it

463.36 --> 470.38
so we'll be done with it that kind of

466.09 --> 472.9
[ __ ] anyway stupid stuff not very

470.38 --> 474.96999999999997
interesting sorry sorry in your crowd I

472.9 --> 478.09
sometimes just talk about my regular

474.97 --> 481.75
life stuff and it actually helps because

478.09 --> 483.25
sometimes I overlook stuff and people in

481.75 --> 487.65
Chad actually give me good advice so

483.25 --> 487.65
it's practical purposes

489.84 --> 492.61999999999995
yeah

499.03 --> 501.75
right

502.14 --> 507.38
yeah I don't like Aries 106 a lot either

507.44 --> 512.25
says very very nasty things in the

510.18 --> 514.53
debates I noticed he's always likes to

512.25 --> 516.95
attack me personally as well there's

514.53 --> 521.16
many trolls out there that just comment

516.95 --> 525.5600000000001
like brutally every time and I appear

521.16 --> 525.56
someone somewhere I don't get it

538.48 --> 544.58
one glass shah-i well for example I

542.089 --> 549.1
don't I yeah turn off the computer all

544.58 --> 551.6600000000001
that [ __ ] when I reset there's not it's

549.1 --> 554.12
it's very clean we don't have any

551.66 --> 556.9699999999999
seriously heavy equipment I don't leave

554.12 --> 560.3
the water cooker on while I do it that

556.97 --> 562.76
kind of [ __ ] so I know what I'm doing

560.3 --> 567.529
it's not that complex

562.76 --> 570.73
I know basic house maintenance so yeah

567.529 --> 570.73
but thanks for the advice

571.87 --> 578.369
[Music]

581.57 --> 589.1600000000001
okay Vladimir Nabokov that's weird story

586.759 --> 591.139
could we I don't know what Ares is into

589.16 --> 592.759
I don't know how you even know him

591.139 --> 597.61
because the only thing I ever get to see

592.759 --> 600.759
is this keyboard warrior trolling I

597.61 --> 600.759
don't know

608.1 --> 613.89
ha that's hilarious flatten earth I

612.57 --> 619.13
didn't even think of that

613.89 --> 623.37
a wireless power switch huh

619.13 --> 624.81
although yeah if it's wireless yeah as

623.37 --> 627.75
long as the remote only has batteries

624.81 --> 631.5799999999999
that shouldn't be a problem yeah that's

627.75 --> 636.2
a funny idea actually that might work

631.58 --> 639.23
huh that's a good one

636.2 --> 641.94
see well that's why I bring up this [ __ ]

639.23 --> 643.74
because people actually think of things

641.94 --> 645.3900000000001
that I didn't really did I haven't

643.74 --> 648.1800000000001
thought of so yeah thanks for the tip

645.39 --> 651.63
man I'll look into it see if it's not

648.18 --> 662.0699999999999
too expensive not too problematic thanks

651.63 --> 666.24
flatten earth Oh God Daniel jarate Jarek

662.07 --> 669.5100000000001
see I mean right I was apparently

666.24 --> 673.86
mentioned in Simon dance video the

669.51 --> 677.0699999999999
branchial debunking right yeah he was in

673.86 --> 679.08
my chat and he was I talked I mention

677.07 --> 683.07
his name a lot yesterday so I'm not

679.08 --> 685.73
surprised didn't realize he would go as

683.07 --> 688.86
far as to make a video out of it

685.73 --> 691.08
debunking me well yeah good luck to him

688.86 --> 693.99
I and I'm not gonna go into some kind of

691.08 --> 695.6700000000001
tag team fight with that [ __ ] if you

693.99 --> 697.92
guys think there are some things

695.67 --> 701.51
particular that requires my attention

697.92 --> 701.51
I'd like to hear about it but

705.92 --> 723.14
okay flat Amir Nabokov right

713.84 --> 724.19
a good fake out good e60 26k views

723.14 --> 727.46
that's crazy

724.19 --> 730.0600000000001
well Simon Dan no you guys do realize

727.46 --> 734.71
that he has bought a lot of subs right

730.06 --> 734.7099999999999
he was notorious for having done that

740.84 --> 750.8000000000001
but yeah sure whatever I guess in my kid

746.9 --> 753.529
in the case of me small-time youtuber

750.8 --> 755.18
with Daily Show I guess that even that

753.529 --> 758.24
kind of exposure is good exposure

755.18 --> 759.9799999999999
because yeah I will come into the scope

758.24 --> 763.029
of some people that have never seen me

759.98 --> 766.79
before because I'm not that widespread

763.029 --> 771.08
just I don't advertise the hell out of

766.79 --> 774.74
my show really I just like to roam

771.08 --> 776.62
around being in people's chat sometimes

774.74 --> 782.1800000000001
on their hangouts especially the debates

776.62 --> 784.19
Nathan stuff like that Randi I sometimes

782.18 --> 787.329
come on Jose's Channel

784.19 --> 787.3290000000001
[Music]

791.42 --> 794.8299999999999
yes I'm in them

796.11 --> 803.01
it's not that expensive really Google

800.13 --> 808.1
just ceases as business strategy so they

803.01 --> 810.48
sell it it's very basic but yeah why not

808.1 --> 812.3100000000001
you know I can't afford that kind of

810.48 --> 814.91
[ __ ] I wouldn't really want to would be

812.31 --> 820.4699999999999
very embarrassing to do that halfway and

814.91 --> 822.81
to me I just like I don't like overkill

820.47 --> 825.27
amounts of attention really I want to

822.81 --> 828.8699999999999
keep track of what who people are in my

825.27 --> 834.46
chat and maybe get them on the panel

828.87 --> 837.99
eventually so

834.46 --> 837.99
but to everyone their own

845.61 --> 851.01
Yeah right and glasha was good to have

847.709 --> 853.41
you do come back you know whenever you

851.01 --> 857.37
feel like it if you got something

853.41 --> 863.2199999999999
special you want to present or share you

857.37 --> 865.5600000000001
know it's good yeah how's my sound by

863.22 --> 868.11
the way I'm not talking about my voice

865.56 --> 876.3599999999999
quality but mainly my sound I put up the

868.11 --> 881.16
reach a little I think I put up my game

876.36 --> 884.04
a little because I thought that the

881.16 --> 886.38
sound output that I get to see in OBS

884.04 --> 890.04
still seems to be a little low on

886.38 --> 892.14
average compared to for example the

890.04 --> 894.1999999999999
sound that comes out of the intro and

892.14 --> 899.279
outro music

894.2 --> 901.019
which is much louder right so yeah I

899.279 --> 904.55
guess I will try to keep it like this

901.019 --> 904.55
then thanks for the feedback

909.07 --> 916.139
right well it's good that you can do

911.11 --> 929.8000000000001
that it's very very carefully formulated

916.139 --> 935.25
simondon Voynich I don't think Simon

929.8 --> 945.329
then understands Dutch definitely not

935.25 --> 945.329
thanks for watching the ads yeah

954.35 --> 967.9200000000001
hello Aries 106 yeah what do I think of

961.07 --> 971.82
Jose's channel I think it's it's okay

967.92 --> 975.51
it's kind of okay really to be fair you

971.82 --> 981.0
know I have severe kou thanks Brendon

975.51 --> 982.86
for the super chat donation two suns two

981.0 --> 987.269
moons for ejection no I haven't seen

982.86 --> 991.9490000000001
that hmm thanks for the superjet much

987.269 --> 998.13
appreciated but to get back yeah Jose

991.949 --> 1002.74
show Jose is on fire right yeah he has a

998.13 --> 1009.43
hall wrench policy type thing yeah hey

1002.74 --> 1009.4300000000001
what are you doing what did he say

1019.94 --> 1033.0800000000002
Shane come on dude anyway back to Jose

1028.43 --> 1037.25
show yeah I yeah it's obviously very

1033.08 --> 1040.3899999999999
real with ballers and it it feels very

1037.25 --> 1043.04
much like the old flat earth debates

1040.39 --> 1045.98
before we figured out how to basically

1043.04 --> 1051.22
counter all this stuff and Nathan

1045.98 --> 1055.76
started a no-nonsense policy and yeah

1051.22 --> 1057.74
it's kind of interesting and it seems to

1055.76 --> 1060.62
attract a lot of people to a lot of the

1057.74 --> 1063.83
more hardcore baller seem to join it and

1060.62 --> 1067.52
that is kind of interesting and yeah

1063.83 --> 1069.74
sure throw me in there and let them

1067.52 --> 1072.17
rattle on for 20 minutes how incompetent

1069.74 --> 1074.39
and idiotic I am and that's all fine and

1072.17 --> 1079.72
then I just continue what we were

1074.39 --> 1079.72
talking about and it kind of works

1086.47 --> 1091.929
all right okay well Shane what Walter

1089.08 --> 1096.46
the thing is it's kind of right probably

1091.929 --> 1099.029
you see that that's just don't go timing

1096.46 --> 1102.789
out unless they're like blatantly

1099.029 --> 1105.37
offense like blatantly not not being

1102.789 --> 1107.46
edgy or whatever or slightly on your

1105.37 --> 1110.7689999999998
nerves but when they're really blatantly

1107.46 --> 1113.019
offensive so please just try to be

1110.769 --> 1115.779
careful because it kind of has a point I

1113.019 --> 1118.36
think that all these new some new

1115.779 --> 1121.029
subscribers even what all also a lot of

1118.36 --> 1127.779
trolls came probably from whatever Simon

1121.029 --> 1129.519
dad did in response to Isaac yeah his

1127.779 --> 1131.7
activity in chat yesterday in my

1129.519 --> 1135.46
response to that on the live show so

1131.7 --> 1141.82
yeah hey whatever wherever he wants to

1135.46 --> 1148.3890000000001
do it's fine I stand behind everything I

1141.82 --> 1151.83
did so I always do because if I don't

1148.389 --> 1151.83
I'm gonna correct it very quickly

1161.26 --> 1169.39
all right crane Brown well what you get

1165.88 --> 1171.3700000000001
is a Daily Show you can watch and if you

1169.39 --> 1173.5900000000001
hit the bail notification you actually

1171.37 --> 1181.84
get warned when it starts so that's what

1173.59 --> 1184.6299999999999
you get for subscribing to our win you

1181.84 --> 1188.22
get at least an hour and a day of our

1184.63 --> 1188.22
win so yeah that's what you get

1193.96 --> 1201.999
okay thanks Ares 106 wait was I

1199.659 --> 1207.159
criticizing Ares 106 earlier because I

1201.999 --> 1210.249
might have accidentally exchanged him

1207.159 --> 1213.3400000000001
with another guy I'm not too sure sorry

1210.249 --> 1216.039
if I was basically [ __ ] on your name

1213.34 --> 1222.34
it might have been somebody else that is

1216.039 --> 1224.679
almost the same name so if yeah if I

1222.34 --> 1226.57
offended somebody by misusing their name

1224.679 --> 1228.6100000000001
or exchanging it then I'm sorry about

1226.57 --> 1231.85
that it's just so many people with so

1228.61 --> 1241.149
many weird names out there it's hard to

1231.85 --> 1246.7489999999998
keep track of hello aunty hello Nathan

1241.149 --> 1246.7489999999998
good to see you and ace McLeod

1250.11 --> 1259.039
it's funny because as McLeod is not a

1254.46 --> 1259.039
smack cloud he's actually a smack loud

1259.37 --> 1275.6
it's kind of Mandela effective it's not

1267.21 --> 1279.779
MacLeod like again and a Highlander

1275.6 --> 1287.2199999999998
MacLeod because that's with an extra

1279.779 --> 1293.279
seat hmm all right Matt H I was sorry

1287.22 --> 1299.75
hello chocolate hi dude trying to get

1293.279 --> 1299.75
off it a thought and I lost track thanks

1300.559 --> 1306.809
right my proofs for Flat Earth okay

1304.83 --> 1310.35
that's a good question I talked about it

1306.809 --> 1312.99
earlier also defended it on Jose's

1310.35 --> 1314.85
channel my proof is a empirical

1312.99 --> 1320.7
deduction based proof so another

1314.85 --> 1324.779
scientific proof stating that in all

1320.7 --> 1330.3890000000001
sight or visuals every time you look at

1324.779 --> 1332.88
the horizon the obstruction rate versus

1330.389 --> 1335.25
the distance beyond the optical slant

1332.88 --> 1338.179
point because beyond the optical slant

1335.25 --> 1341.61
point is where the obstruction starts is

1338.179 --> 1346.2
linear so the obstruction rate versus

1341.61 --> 1349.019
distance is linear measurably and from

1346.2 --> 1352.46
that you can geometrically deduce based

1349.019 --> 1356.76
on empirical evidence mainly all visuals

1352.46 --> 1359.3990000000001
that the shape of the earth is not

1356.76 --> 1362.149
curved or round in any way because then

1359.399 --> 1365.1
the obstruction rate would have to be

1362.149 --> 1367.289
cumulative and it's not it's linear it's

1365.1 --> 1371.399
a straight line and when you take a

1367.289 --> 1373.529
straight line and you try to do anything

1371.399 --> 1377.4189999999999
with it make it into a shape make it

1373.529 --> 1381.389
into 3d it will always be a flat plane

1377.419 --> 1383.0500000000002
it's a simple geometrical empirical

1381.389 --> 1387.07
based deduction

1383.05 --> 1394.09
that is how I know the earth is flat

1387.07 --> 1396.24
that is my proof I hope that answers

1394.09 --> 1396.24
your question

1404.7 --> 1415.1200000000001
Masada 90 11 well yeah the Netherlands

1411.49 --> 1415.72
is pretty damn flat overall but I could

1415.12 --> 1417.55
do that

1415.72 --> 1421.54
but I think that adding a bit of

1417.55 --> 1423.8799999999999
geometrical deduction is more more valid

1421.54 --> 1425.95
and more study about and potentially

1423.88 --> 1428.23
disprovable I'm still waiting for people

1425.95 --> 1430.72
to actually disprove my assertion in

1428.23 --> 1434.26
this that the obstruction rate is

1430.72 --> 1436.33
provably not linear still waiting for

1434.26 --> 1441.19
that because I've been saying this for

1436.33 --> 1443.6699999999998
months years even I don't know for a

1441.19 --> 1443.67
long time

1449.21 --> 1458.429
right well gee Daniel Gareth II I don't

1454.86 --> 1464.01
just base it on my eyes i base it on all

1458.429 --> 1466.74
sight optics video use a telescope on

1464.01 --> 1469.62
the horizon if you want you know just

1466.74 --> 1471.8700000000001
show that the obstruction rate versus

1469.62 --> 1476.4799999999998
distance beyond the optical slant point

1471.87 --> 1481.52
is not linear cumulative in some way and

1476.48 --> 1481.52
ya present that evidence to me please

1482.84 --> 1488.3999999999999
good but I think it's gonna be very

1485.79 --> 1490.07
tough for you to find such evidence

1488.4 --> 1492.1200000000001
because I don't think there is any

1490.07 --> 1497.9399999999998
because I'm pretty sure the earth is

1492.12 --> 1502.559
flat oh my god even during the show the

1497.94 --> 1506.76
comments keep on coming and the Dutch

1502.559 --> 1509.25
school system has failed you Darwin is

1506.76 --> 1512.34
so disgusting over an hour you do on

1509.25 --> 1513.059
this can see that's what I'm talking

1512.34 --> 1520.11
about

1513.059 --> 1522.24
troll [ __ ] anyway I do appreciate the

1520.11 --> 1526.83
people that have actually joined the

1522.24 --> 1529.5
live chat on the show and yeah

1526.83 --> 1533.25
ask me questions always good even if

1529.5 --> 1539.12
you're a flat earth skeptic it's always

1533.25 --> 1539.12
good hey life is short good to see you

1541.67 --> 1552.679
plan yeah [ __ ] you of course and there's

1544.41 --> 1552.679
ace and Jessa Conda

1557.36 --> 1559.9599999999998
what

1568.64 --> 1571.51
hmm

1572.1 --> 1584.1599999999999
with some interesting conversations here

1574.38 --> 1586.5300000000002
I kind of missed out okay Andy Jeffers

1584.16 --> 1590.15
earlier as said but there is an

1586.53 --> 1592.02
obstruction rate so it cannot be flat

1590.15 --> 1595.92
that's ridiculous

1592.02 --> 1598.65
it's an optical effect it's not

1595.92 --> 1600.8100000000002
literally curved it's an obstruction

1598.65 --> 1603.21
effect due to perspective limited

1600.81 --> 1606.54
viewing angle diffraction limit all that

1603.21 --> 1609.93
combined and the other atmospherical

1606.54 --> 1611.73
influences cause when you look over a

1609.93 --> 1615.48
flat surface and you can prove this you

1611.73 --> 1619.31
can test it even in in a small setup the

1615.48 --> 1621.66
obstruction starts to happen

1619.31 --> 1624.21
automatically if you look over a flat

1621.66 --> 1626.22
surface try it out there's many videos

1624.21 --> 1629.97
of this like in warehouses that have

1626.22 --> 1633.42
perfectly flat surfaces smoothing out or

1629.97 --> 1635.01
almost perfectly flat maybe some little

1633.42 --> 1637.47
irregularities you couldn't look and

1635.01 --> 1639.69
yeah you can basically drop things out

1637.47 --> 1642.23
of sight you can have a light and drop

1639.69 --> 1648.18
it out of sight in the distance on that

1642.23 --> 1650.28
provably flat surface so yeah that's the

1648.18 --> 1654.0
thing it's part of optics it's a part of

1650.28 --> 1656.1
sight inherent to site and it is any

1654.0 --> 1659.82
flat surface in an or in any orientation

1656.1 --> 1662.4599999999998
because you can do it on a ceiling a

1659.82 --> 1667.1699999999998
flat ceiling as well things will also be

1662.46 --> 1670.32
obstructed in the distance when you look

1667.17 --> 1672.0600000000002
very close to the ceiling and somewhere

1670.32 --> 1674.73
in the distance on the ceiling you put

1672.06 --> 1677.34
something against it it will go out of

1674.73 --> 1680.82
sight just as well and the same goes for

1677.34 --> 1683.61
the side of a very long flat surface the

1680.82 --> 1687.78
same effect goes there as well it's a

1683.61 --> 1691.53
natural side effect of optics so no

1687.78 --> 1693.98
obstruction is not proof that the earth

1691.53 --> 1693.98
is not flat

1694.76 --> 1699.59
if you want to get into that then you

1697.49 --> 1701.809
have to go into geometrical deductions

1699.59 --> 1704.9599999999998
and see what the obstruction rate versus

1701.809 --> 1708.32
distance is and I'm telling you it's

1704.96 --> 1710.71
going to be linear and linear cannot be

1708.32 --> 1710.71
curved

1716.84 --> 1726.62
Oh God here come the newbies know the

1723.44 --> 1729.8600000000001
fact the circumference of the earth is

1726.62 --> 1736.399
40 kilometers is a presuppositional hour

1729.86 --> 1739.9289999999999
based piece of assumption this is

1736.399 --> 1739.9289999999999
there's no factor

1742.25 --> 1745.27
that's right data

1755.84 --> 1759.55
right so anything else

1764.25 --> 1769.679
yeah yeah Brian Edwards I can explain

1767.19 --> 1772.679
the celestial pose on the flat earth the

1769.679 --> 1776.5800000000002
celestial poles are a part of the

1772.679 --> 1779.97
apparent demise fear that you get to see

1776.58 --> 1782.549
that is yeah that if you change your

1779.97 --> 1784.3500000000001
position on the earth the orientation of

1782.549 --> 1786.15
the deme sphere will be different and

1784.35 --> 1788.85
the damaged sphere the apparent damage

1786.15 --> 1792.0
sphere the globe of the heavens as I

1788.85 --> 1794.1899999999998
call it which we can only see literally

1792.0 --> 1796.02
as a demise fear at all times and never

1794.19 --> 1797.73
a full sphere because you can't see

1796.02 --> 1799.679
stars underneath the horizon and I wish

1797.73 --> 1801.51
you good luck trying that and prove that

1799.679 --> 1805.2
it is actually a literal sphere in any

1801.51 --> 1811.23
way but the apparent demise fear yeah

1805.2 --> 1813.299
has an orientation it spins for

1811.23 --> 1819.15
mysterious reasons which some people

1813.299 --> 1821.61
suggest maybe the ether and yeah it's

1819.15 --> 1825.0
apparent because not nothing of the

1821.61 --> 1827.58
globe of the heavens is all those lights

1825.0 --> 1830.58
are not originating from any literal

1827.58 --> 1834.36
location they're all optical phenomena

1830.58 --> 1839.3999999999999
as part of a giant thing that is out

1834.36 --> 1841.6789999999999
there that produces light somehow but

1839.4 --> 1843.72
nothing of it is in any literal location

1841.679 --> 1846.21
it's only an apparent location like a

1843.72 --> 1848.1000000000001
rainbow is only in an apparent location

1846.21 --> 1851.429
there's no literal position the rainbow

1848.1 --> 1854.4499999999998
is in when observed and the same goes

1851.429 --> 1857.0700000000002
for all the heavenly bodies in my

1854.45 --> 1858.45
understanding I haven't seen any proof

1857.07 --> 1860.6399999999999
to the contrary I haven't seen any

1858.45 --> 1866.19
approachability of any of the heavenly

1860.64 --> 1868.4
bodies and I've seen quite a lot of

1866.19 --> 1868.4
footage

1870.83 --> 1877.33
yeah Matt H there is no edge of the

1875.21 --> 1877.33
earth

1880.4 --> 1887.8200000000002
that's a myth it's a myth

1885.45 --> 1891.1200000000001
probably a rumor to this and to

1887.82 --> 1893.58
discourage fishermen from going out too

1891.12 --> 1895.8
far at sea because yeah you get the

1893.58 --> 1899.1
uptick visually you can see an optical

1895.8 --> 1901.4099999999999
slant so if somebody looks at the

1899.1 --> 1902.6399999999999
horizon and they don't really know what

1901.41 --> 1905.3700000000001
they're looking at and somebody

1902.64 --> 1908.88
manipulative a controller tells them

1905.37 --> 1911.1599999999999
yeah that's the edge beyond that edge

1908.88 --> 1913.5900000000001
everything falls off that's the story

1911.16 --> 1917.01
that's where probably the origins of the

1913.59 --> 1919.6799999999998
edge of the earth comes from it's a

1917.01 --> 1924.09
control mechanism to keep people from

1919.68 --> 1928.49
wandering off too far at sea but there

1924.09 --> 1928.49
is no edge of the earth in reality

1932.74 --> 1937.38
[Music]

1934.18 --> 1940.3300000000002
I don't need to prove there is an edge

1937.38 --> 1944.25
because I don't need there to be an edge

1940.33 --> 1946.99
in my conceptual model of the Flat Earth

1944.25 --> 1948.94
because I have the concept of looping

1946.99 --> 1951.04
which is a presupposition by the way I

1948.94 --> 1954.88
would have to actually prove it to be

1951.04 --> 1958.36
certain but I conceptualize that this

1954.88 --> 1961.72
realm is a looping confine and when

1958.36 --> 1965.9499999999998
there is a loop in the space you don't

1961.72 --> 1968.38
need a well you don't need a physical

1965.95 --> 1971.74
container even the loop is the container

1968.38 --> 1973.66
and yeah you just go from one side and

1971.74 --> 1977.92
you end up at the other so it's

1973.66 --> 1984.3400000000001
continual flat and continual it's very

1977.92 --> 1986.5900000000001
surreal but it could be real and this is

1984.34 --> 1988.78
not a joke this is really what I've been

1986.59 --> 1994.9299999999998
trying to explain to people for now for

1988.78 --> 1999.67
years almost and that's why I call my

1994.93 --> 2004.1000000000001
model rectangular looping look it up in

1999.67 --> 2006.6000000000001
my old videos from Flat Earth talks

2004.1 --> 2008.8799999999999
we've got several videos explaining

2006.6 --> 2012.33
aspects of the rectangular looping earth

2008.88 --> 2014.5500000000002
and they all still are well up to date

2012.33 --> 2015.98
conceptually with everything else that I

2014.55 --> 2018.24
figured out by now

2015.98 --> 2020.7
mostly just discovered more details

2018.24 --> 2023.48
about optics about how to interpret what

2020.7 --> 2025.65
we see but before that the model

2023.48 --> 2028.68
conceptualizations were pretty much as

2025.65 --> 2032.3400000000001
they were pretty early on I just figured

2028.68 --> 2035.0600000000002
it out and put something in a hangout so

2032.34 --> 2035.06
you can always look back

2039.95 --> 2049.85
yeah a loop look I know what a loop is

2046.38 --> 2049.85
and it's not a noose

2055.139 --> 2061.279
Luke Luke and would be a continuum in

2058.619 --> 2061.279
that sense

2068.919 --> 2071.669
right

2074.36 --> 2082.32
Wow Masada

2077.389 --> 2085.6490000000003
1911 I do not know personally for a fact

2082.32 --> 2088.5800000000004
that Japan exists but I've seen so many

2085.649 --> 2092.3399999999997
things that suggested it exists that I

2088.58 --> 2099.44
can safely feel safe to assume that it

2092.34 --> 2099.44
exists so yeah

2109.4 --> 2117.529
right that's funny too legit to quit why

2114.89 --> 2119.69
has nothing bounced off the dome well it

2117.529 --> 2122.48
could be several reasons one reason

2119.69 --> 2122.93
could be there is no dome yeah you heard

2122.48 --> 2125.72
me

2122.93 --> 2127.93
rectangular looping confine makes it

2125.72 --> 2131.93
superfluous you don't need them

2127.93 --> 2134.319
another thing could be nothing from the

2131.93 --> 2137.8089999999997
earth can actually reach the dome

2134.319 --> 2139.759
because the conditions the thin air and

2137.809 --> 2142.3390000000004
maybe temperature conditions other

2139.759 --> 2145.88
aspects electrical whatever's going on

2142.339 --> 2148.94
there may simply just make it unable for

2145.88 --> 2153.7690000000002
any physical objects using some kind of

2148.94 --> 2157.609
propulsion to actually touch it could be

2153.769 --> 2159.41
either so either there is no dome or we

2157.609 --> 2162.17
haven't been able to actually touch it

2159.41 --> 2164.029
so far or at least we haven't found any

2162.17 --> 2166.9300000000003
conclusive evidence that it is

2164.029 --> 2166.93
physically there

2172.56 --> 2178.16
right well I'm not against the dough but

2178.97 --> 2185.85
there is a container somehow because of

2182.94 --> 2188.55
the gas pressure has to be said

2185.85 --> 2192.35
antecedent but doesn't mean it has to be

2188.55 --> 2195.78
a literal dem eye glass dem my Globe

2192.35 --> 2198.11
surrounding or sitting over the earth

2195.78 --> 2201.9300000000003
confines doesn't have to be like that

2198.11 --> 2205.59
if the realm is similar torii in nature

2201.93 --> 2209.43
and has a looping factor in it then the

2205.59 --> 2212.25
the spatial limited confine would be the

2209.43 --> 2214.83
container because the gas would be

2212.25 --> 2217.74
pressing against itself from all sides

2214.83 --> 2220.5299999999997
basically or well at least from the

2217.74 --> 2222.39
horizontal sides vertically it's

2220.53 --> 2223.4900000000002
something else I am not even too sure

2222.39 --> 2226.98
about that

2223.49 --> 2231.0899999999997
I've speculated it could go on for a

2226.98 --> 2233.73
very long time potentially forever but

2231.09 --> 2235.5
there's no way to tell or it could

2233.73 --> 2238.47
simply be cut off at some point and

2235.5 --> 2240.87
either loop back onto the bottom of the

2238.47 --> 2245.24
earth somehow or there would be a

2240.87 --> 2251.79
barrier of some kind where matter simply

2245.24 --> 2255.7099999999996
cannot exist beyond either either one of

2251.79 --> 2259.1
those factors if there's not a doubt so

2255.71 --> 2264.92
but it's all still very mysterious

2259.1 --> 2264.92
really so much answers left to be found

2291.99 --> 2298.2299999999996
yeah yeah Masada and 1911 I do

2295.619 --> 2300.81
presuppose a lot in that I know that

2298.23 --> 2304.13
that's why it's a concept not talking

2300.81 --> 2309.57
about anything scientifically proven but

2304.13 --> 2311.76
with these concepts proof can be found

2309.57 --> 2313.5
technically the upper atmosphere parts

2311.76 --> 2316.13
going to be very difficult but if the

2313.5 --> 2320.82
earth if the earth confine itself is

2316.13 --> 2322.92
looping that can be proven in several

2320.82 --> 2325.589
ways and I've explained them all in my

2322.92 --> 2329.4500000000003
recent hangouts go and older hangouts

2325.589 --> 2332.369
mostly there are various ways to

2329.45 --> 2339.3489999999997
determine whether the earth is looping

2332.369 --> 2343.53
or not and some of it may require

2339.349 --> 2346.5
ginormous lasers being fired

2343.53 --> 2349.2000000000003
horizontally and then seeing if the

2346.5 --> 2350.76
laser if if it has to be strong enough

2349.2 --> 2352.3199999999997
in the first place to have that kind of

2350.76 --> 2355.1090000000004
reach through the atmosphere and then

2352.32 --> 2360.81
see if it will actually be able to fire

2355.109 --> 2362.8489999999997
past itself from behind but yeah that

2360.81 --> 2365.82
has to be technically possible for a

2362.849 --> 2366.38
laser to do first in order to figure

2365.82 --> 2369.48
that one out

2366.38 --> 2372.26
but yeah by measuring out the Earth's

2369.48 --> 2377.63
surface and then putting it in a grid

2372.26 --> 2381.2400000000002
and then see how it dynamically

2377.63 --> 2385.349
interconnects in a way where the surface

2381.24 --> 2389.64
would yeah be not be a projection but in

2385.349 --> 2393.3900000000003
a literal scale everything is exactly to

2389.64 --> 2397.7599999999998
scale well the same scale each part is

2393.39 --> 2397.7599999999998
the same scale so no warping of

2398.48 --> 2403.02
longitude latitude lines but just

2400.98 --> 2405.63
literal physical representation

2403.02 --> 2407.31
basically in miniature yeah that's going

2405.63 --> 2408.96
to be very difficult because can't

2407.31 --> 2411.15
physically be done but if you can have

2408.96 --> 2412.89
all the parts then you and you can

2411.15 --> 2415.6800000000003
determine how it is interconnected then

2412.89 --> 2418.3489999999997
you can work with that you can model

2415.68 --> 2421.98
with that then you can see how the earth

2418.349 --> 2422.73
is interconnected the surface is

2421.98 --> 2424.3
interconnected

2422.73 --> 2428.56
despite

2424.3 --> 2432.4
it not being literally in a shape and

2428.56 --> 2434.86
yeah I've even speculated if you model

2432.4 --> 2440.44
that out then the earth might turn out

2434.86 --> 2443.53
to be a perfectly flat globe where the

2440.44 --> 2446.5
space of the Earth's surface is

2443.53 --> 2447.88
interconnected like a globe but the

2446.5 --> 2451.72
actual Earth's surface would be

2447.88 --> 2457.81
technically flat so yeah try to wrap

2451.72 --> 2464.7099999999996
your head around that one it's a good

2457.81 --> 2467.14
mind twister isn't it but yeah that's

2464.71 --> 2471.09
still speculation at this time but that

2467.14 --> 2474.43
could be figured out if we can map out

2471.09 --> 2477.1600000000003
everything according to our own design

2474.43 --> 2480.8799999999997
and not by some old standard way to

2477.16 --> 2485.2599999999998
approach it through projection through

2480.88 --> 2487.12
the typical projection anyway yeah with

2485.26 --> 2489.34
modern scanners and everything surface

2487.12 --> 2492.79
scanner sea bottom scanners it could all

2489.34 --> 2494.77
be done it wouldn't even cost that much

2492.79 --> 2496.84
time and effort really compared to say

2494.77 --> 2500.31
100 years ago where this would take an

2496.84 --> 2500.31
enormous amount of effort to do

2505.89 --> 2512.3799999999997
[Music]

2508.68 --> 2515.71
what would prove to you that the earth

2512.38 --> 2517.42
is a sphere well the earth being a

2515.71 --> 2519.64
sphere would prove that the earth is a

2517.42 --> 2522.25
sphere but it's not so it's going to be

2519.64 --> 2526.5099999999998
kind of difficult to prove something is

2522.25 --> 2530.95
what it is I wish you the best of luck

2526.51 --> 2532.869
go and find that curvature go in outer

2530.95 --> 2536.5299999999997
space and see the ball in the distance

2532.869 --> 2541.3900000000003
go to the moon do it in one shot if you

2536.53 --> 2543.57
can but you can't you know good luck

2541.39 --> 2543.5699999999997
with that

2552.34 --> 2556.28
[Music]

2564.8 --> 2573.1000000000004
Oh interesting life is short oh I'll be

2569.9 --> 2573.1
sure to take a look at that

2582.599 --> 2587.82
Hey

2584.76 --> 2592.38
yeah it's all done just don't think

2587.82 --> 2595.82
about it just just trust to read out

2592.38 --> 2600.06
from the computer that NASA provides you

2595.82 --> 2603.51
trust the model they presuppose so all

2600.06 --> 2605.7599999999998
evidence all the satellite readings all

2603.51 --> 2609.11
the footage of the satellite filming the

2605.76 --> 2617.19
Sun yes so real

2609.11 --> 2621.21
has to be if only they had just put a

2617.19 --> 2623.34
camera on the satellite filming the Sun

2621.21 --> 2625.17
so you could actually prove that it is a

2623.34 --> 2627.1200000000003
satellite filming the Sun wouldn't that

2625.17 --> 2630.36
be interesting but yeah it's too late

2627.12 --> 2634.52
for that you just have to DCG I know I

2630.36 --> 2634.52
have to settle for that

2658.54 --> 2662.46
hello conspiracy cats

2672.079 --> 2677.949
Wow my jet has been exceptionally busy

2682.2 --> 2689.91
okay Masada 1911 is Dutch apparently

2690.78 --> 2694.9500000000003
okay fine

2708.64 --> 2718.3799999999997
whoo I got no mice and I got no kitty

2715.78 --> 2718.38
litter either

2729.749 --> 2737.7389999999996
léo tesslar clockwise and

2735.999 --> 2741.839
counter-clockwise are relative

2737.739 --> 2745.71
directions stars everywhere on the world

2741.839 --> 2750.88
rise in the east and set in the West

2745.71 --> 2756.93
except for Polaris which does not rise

2750.88 --> 2756.9300000000003
and set naturally in its cycle

2771.23 --> 2779.599
your roof working okay don't get too

2774.5 --> 2782.45
distracted by any special non-linearity

2779.599 --> 2790.73
and suddenly you drop your hammer into a

2782.45 --> 2797.1499999999996
wormhole or something good to hear

2790.73 --> 2801.5
you're listening Yeah right do you

2797.15 --> 2803.15
happen to know do you happen to know

2801.5 --> 2806.9
chocolate saying because he actually

2803.15 --> 2810.52
packages solar panels it's funny a lot

2806.9 --> 2810.52
of Sun solar panel works

2818.29 --> 2823.69
all right yeah thanks yeah the the new

2820.93 --> 2826.0299999999997
Mike I'm quite satisfied with it so far

2823.69 --> 2829.36
although to be a little bit more careful

2826.03 --> 2831.5800000000004
with touching the table because it does

2829.36 --> 2836.4100000000003
resonate a lot more but other than that

2831.58 --> 2837.72
yeah the sound is a lot better nice and

2836.41 --> 2840.7
clear

2837.72 --> 2844.24
though I do have to remind myself always

2840.7 --> 2845.5
to unmute the mute button because yeah

2844.24 --> 2848.29
the other thing didn't have a mute

2845.5 --> 2850.27
button I have to get used to that don't

2848.29 --> 2852.54
forget it when you and when you start

2850.27 --> 2852.54
the show

2853.44 --> 2860.71
but yeah I'm glad yeah the sound

2859.21 --> 2863.55
improvement is to your satisfaction

2860.71 --> 2867.19
that's what I did it for thanks to the

2863.55 --> 2868.9900000000002
super chat donations and and helped

2867.19 --> 2872.73
through PayPal I managed to get a better

2868.99 --> 2872.7299999999996
microphone so yeah it's a good start

2875.31 --> 2880.5
yeah yeah take Logan 16 yeah that's

2879.4 --> 2885.46
right I said it

2880.5 --> 2888.57
that's right it's funny how you some of

2885.46 --> 2891.31
you try to quote me in something I said

2888.57 --> 2891.88
expecting me to be intimidated by it in

2891.31 --> 2895.89
somehow

2891.88 --> 2895.8900000000003
well I fully support that statement

2899.52 --> 2903.93
because she just don't understand you

2903.18 --> 2906.7799999999997
don't get it

2903.93 --> 2908.49
so you just ridicule it because because

2906.78 --> 2914.25
you don't get it it just sounds silly to

2908.49 --> 2916.47
you I get that but I'm yeah I'm not

2914.25 --> 2919.56
gonna say things in that kind of

2916.47 --> 2923.1
direction if I wasn't sure I'm on to

2919.56 --> 2925.59
something and I can't reason it out why

2923.1 --> 2931.41
I think these things how i reaiiy come

2925.59 --> 2933.09
to these conclusions so thanks : turning

2931.41 --> 2934.3399999999997
for the 5-pound super chat much

2933.09 --> 2937.02
appreciated

2934.34 --> 2944.73
good to see you're enjoying my hangouts

2937.02 --> 2947.79
these days right the the overall

2944.73 --> 2949.53
improving weather and just the winter

2947.79 --> 2951.84
finally ending in the springtime is

2949.53 --> 2954.3300000000004
always better for me if I have something

2951.84 --> 2956.4
to do and yeah since I have a show daily

2954.33 --> 2961.56
now I think it's gonna be a very good

2956.4 --> 2963.9900000000002
springtime for me and yeah the show will

2961.56 --> 2967.7
go fluidly like it has today by the way

2963.99 --> 2970.68
yeah well with 50 minutes in and I

2967.7 --> 2979.89
haven't stopped talking for almost a

2970.68 --> 2982.89
second hmm so funny alright Billy was a

2979.89 --> 2986.5499999999997
good to see your thinking in the same

2982.89 --> 2992.0099999999998
direction it's it's so funny that even

2986.55 --> 2995.67
with with flat earthers or flat earthers

2992.01 --> 2998.28
and ballers that some people do actually

2995.67 --> 3001.88
agree with aspects of what I talk about

2998.28 --> 3004.9700000000003
and not about other aspects and then

3001.88 --> 3007.46
other people do the exact opposite it's

3004.97 --> 3010.16
so funny how it works it's everybody has

3007.46 --> 3012.35
their own things that they can

3010.16 --> 3015.3799999999997
understand or latch onto or see

3012.35 --> 3016.91
something in it and other things they

3015.38 --> 3020.42
just can't see it's so funny how that

3016.91 --> 3026.3199999999997
seems to work everybody picks their own

3020.42 --> 3028.7400000000002
ideas in the WoW SPECT wide spectrum of

3026.32 --> 3031.319
conceptualization of the earth

3028.74 --> 3034.3999999999996
it's good it's actually kind of

3031.319 --> 3034.4
enjoyable to see that

3040.69 --> 3046.94
[Music]

3043.64 --> 3049.21
all right well sorry I'm sorry you feel

3046.94 --> 3049.21
that way

3057.359 --> 3063.65
yeah what why is that and yeah very

3061.619 --> 3067.4100000000003
[ __ ]

3063.65 --> 3070.2490000000003
right why is that why do people

3067.41 --> 3072.769
interpret things and information in

3070.249 --> 3076.769
different ways it's because everybody

3072.769 --> 3078.66
has their own timing and they're in

3076.769 --> 3082.4689999999996
their interests in what they're ready

3078.66 --> 3088.259
for to learn about it's all a matter of

3082.469 --> 3090.93
timing because intellectual and

3088.259 --> 3093.209
knowledge development functions in

3090.93 --> 3096.959
specific patterns it works in certain

3093.209 --> 3098.999
ways in certain cycles and you can first

3096.959 --> 3101.4199999999996
need to touch upon a subject then you

3098.999 --> 3106.019
need to have the energy in the bottom

3101.42 --> 3108.869
the room the hunger for learning to

3106.019 --> 3110.7589999999996
spark up and then you go into it and you

3108.869 --> 3113.94
latch on to it and then once you do you

3110.759 --> 3116.219
tend to kind of often deflect other

3113.94 --> 3118.68
concepts for the time being because you

3116.219 --> 3120.9
focus on this thing and that's just how

3118.68 --> 3124.9489999999996
it works that's how you develop new

3120.9 --> 3126.539
depths one piece at a time or some

3124.949 --> 3128.549
people that are very good at

3126.539 --> 3131.6090000000004
multitasking very talented can do

3128.549 --> 3134.279
multiple subjects at the same time but

3131.609 --> 3136.65
yeah most normal people most common

3134.279 --> 3138.119
people don't do that very well I don't

3136.65 --> 3140.219
do it very well I can do some

3138.119 --> 3144.949
multitasking but usually not too much

3140.219 --> 3148.739
just yeah sometimes it's just not enough

3144.949 --> 3151.469
material really to to work with new

3148.739 --> 3153.9
ideas or sometimes hard to be found

3151.469 --> 3158.7290000000003
because yeah though all the ballers seem

3153.9 --> 3161.279
to do is mostly recycle [ __ ] and the

3158.729 --> 3164.0389999999998
flat earthers I know are focused a lot

3161.279 --> 3168.079
on just breaking down the globe [ __ ]

3164.039 --> 3171.1800000000003
details and yeah not a lot of stuff gets

3168.079 --> 3173.19
figured out that way new information

3171.18 --> 3178.41
doesn't approach you a lot that way so

3173.19 --> 3182.339
after well find new ground somehow and

3178.41 --> 3184.5589999999997
yeah entertaining the ballers the ones

3182.339 --> 3187.499
that are very widely studied yields some

3184.559 --> 3189.719
of this result to me that's why I go on

3187.499 --> 3190.589
holidays hang out and let the rumpus and

3189.719 --> 3193.2000000000003
all

3190.589 --> 3195.509
you let them all just [ __ ] right over me

3193.2 --> 3198.8999999999996
for 20 minutes straight because after

3195.509 --> 3201.119
that if I just ignore it see it as a

3198.9 --> 3203.819
psychological side effect of who they

3201.119 --> 3206.309
are they just can't help it then yeah

3203.819 --> 3209.849
they actually start to ask questions

3206.309 --> 3212.13
about my model and that's really good

3209.849 --> 3215.5190000000002
that's interesting because they have a

3212.13 --> 3217.559
lot of data to reflect upon because they

3215.519 --> 3219.3289999999997
studied it now they of course studied it

3217.559 --> 3220.8900000000003
with the belief in the ball earth but

3219.329 --> 3223.489
it's still a lot of data they've been

3220.89 --> 3227.5789999999997
confronted with and I want to kind of I

3223.489 --> 3231.809
want some of that because I haven't read

3227.579 --> 3233.67
a lot of books so it's good to deal with

3231.809 --> 3237.3590000000004
somebody despite their bad attitudes

3233.67 --> 3239.13
because that have some studied

3237.359 --> 3240.989
information that have sources that have

3239.13 --> 3243.1800000000003
looked into these details with whatever

3240.989 --> 3245.67
mindset but they have looked into it and

3243.18 --> 3249.8089999999997
that's good and they kind of like it too

3245.67 --> 3252.059
because then they can reflect upon their

3249.809 --> 3254.94
information whatever they believe and

3252.059 --> 3256.829
kind of be like a teacher and they kind

3254.94 --> 3259.079
of like that because you get the respect

3256.829 --> 3261.0890000000004
from the student and that's fine it's

3259.079 --> 3263.9100000000003
kind of a weird setup but it's fine it

3261.089 --> 3270.69
works and this way for example I deduce

3263.91 --> 3274.3799999999997
that apparently time variates over

3270.69 --> 3277.44
height that's what's very wierd the the

3274.38 --> 3281.7000000000003
cesium clock thing that even though very

3277.44 --> 3283.17
mildly if you change the altitude of the

3281.7 --> 3285.029
cesium clock that is completely

3283.17 --> 3288.989
impervious to pressure or temperature

3285.029 --> 3294.239
electrical influences that the time

3288.989 --> 3296.609
seems to reduce when you go down on the

3294.239 --> 3300.33
surface seems to slow down and when you

3296.609 --> 3303.79
go up it goes faster that's just

3300.33 --> 3307.359
fascinating but it's minut but it is

3303.79 --> 3309.46
still data it is something it's data

3307.359 --> 3311.38
it's fun fascinating and I got this

3309.46 --> 3314.2
purely just from talking to the rumpus

3311.38 --> 3315.369
so this is good stuff yeah I complained

3314.2 --> 3318.22
every step of the way

3315.369 --> 3320.32
of course as rumpus does but I still got

3318.22 --> 3323.89
this tidbit of information and I find it

3320.32 --> 3326.05
fascinating it's just more data keep in

3323.89 --> 3338.31
the back of my mind it like what could

3326.05 --> 3341.79
cause that where is it tied into dB I

3338.31 --> 3341.79
already did that

3357.14 --> 3363.2
mm-hmm yep

3360.68 --> 3365.5499999999997
don't forget Neil deGrasse Tyson pair

3363.2 --> 3374.4689999999996
reviewed the earth

3365.55 --> 3374.469
[Music]

3383.99 --> 3394.609
Oh God our s Kyle probably a lack of

3391.81 --> 3398.21
electrical phenomena overall isn't my

3394.609 --> 3399.94
specialty the way I do realize it's tied

3398.21 --> 3404.89
into a lot of things I don't know I

3399.94 --> 3409.849
think I probably accept the equations of

3404.89 --> 3412.19
electromagnetics sure but you'd have to

3409.849 --> 3414.8300000000004
refer me to something more detailed in

3412.19 --> 3418.7200000000003
order for me to give a definitive

3414.83 --> 3425.56
conclusion about how much I agree to it

3418.72 --> 3425.56
sorry so yeah I'm not very widely read

3426.13 --> 3435.04
hello Ali be great having you on

3431.42 --> 3435.04
yesterday was awesome

3450.17 --> 3456.039
okay Rory all you have to take that up

3453.71 --> 3458.809
with rumpus 10 because he's the one that

3456.039 --> 3463.789
definitively told me that if you go up

3458.809 --> 3467.63
higher time goes slightly faster if you

3463.789 --> 3470.42
go lower time goes slightly slower and

3467.63 --> 3474.039
just in significant amounts but

3470.42 --> 3474.039
persistent amount so

3480.4 --> 3486.65
what are you whining about Neil deGrasse

3483.859 --> 3490.459
Tyson did pare review the earth come on

3486.65 --> 3497.539
don't even you don't even get the joke

3490.459 --> 3499.8689999999997
do you then why do you bring up Neil

3497.539 --> 3499.869
deGrasse Tyson

3507.69 --> 3512.75
all right wait yeah well I wasn't

3510.539 --> 3519.3900000000003
talking about weight I was talking about

3512.75 --> 3522.93
time using a cesium clock which is not

3519.39 --> 3525.75
influenced by any force temperature or a

3522.93 --> 3528.0
high temperature of easily but none of

3525.75 --> 3532.41
the usual affect it's a radioactive

3528.0 --> 3535.01
clock apparently so so yeah it does

3532.41 --> 3535.0099999999998
differentiate

3544.47 --> 3551.16
I don't know Roy I don't know what he

3548.1 --> 3554.43
put together probably the usual but yeah

3551.16 --> 3556.7999999999997
he was in my chat yesterday and I

3554.43 --> 3560.37
answered his questions and then shut him

3556.8 --> 3561.6200000000003
up when he went all [ __ ] which tends

3560.37 --> 3564.66
to happen eventually

3561.62 --> 3566.7599999999998
and if you read it really about it being

3564.66 --> 3569.31
all smug and thinking he's won and

3566.76 --> 3572.4900000000002
everything in it I'm so stupid stupid

3569.31 --> 3574.56
well that's good on him you know I don't

3572.49 --> 3578.3999999999996
really give a [ __ ] but what he says

3574.56 --> 3581.91
anyway I allow him in chat that's as far

3578.4 --> 3584.55
as it goes you may actually try to risk

3581.91 --> 3587.49
coming on my channel if he likes on the

3584.55 --> 3589.86
panel and then we can get more

3587.49 --> 3596.3999999999996
face-to-face I don't care really but if

3589.86 --> 3601.56
he wants to do that that's fine Jesus I

3596.4 --> 3603.6600000000003
may need to just cut off the freaking

3601.56 --> 3609.87
comment section because these troll just

3603.66 --> 3612.98
keep on coming it's just so annoying I

3609.87 --> 3612.98
want some peace and quiet

3619.24 --> 3628.37
right well Rory weight is kind of a

3625.85 --> 3632.33
difficult concept at that because weight

3628.37 --> 3634.37
is kind of relative depending on forces

3632.33 --> 3639.77
applied and the apparent force of

3634.37 --> 3643.37
gravity if you assume that but yeah I

3639.77 --> 3645.89
wasn't talking about weights right I was

3643.37 --> 3647.8399999999997
talking about time time as a concept now

3645.89 --> 3650.6299999999997
I find it very interesting that there is

3647.84 --> 3651.8900000000003
a variation in time that's very unusual

3650.63 --> 3655.12
and that is all

3651.89 --> 3658.12
so don't drag other [ __ ] into it please

3655.12 --> 3658.12
nonsense

3676.66 --> 3684.04
Oh oh my god Oh

3680.14 --> 3686.44
oh yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna denounce my

3684.04 --> 3691.56
flatterer thism I'm gonna say it's a

3686.44 --> 3695.71
ball because of the trolls yeah right

3691.56 --> 3697.66
sorry but if I would give in to that

3695.71 --> 3701.31
kind of peer pressure I would not be

3697.66 --> 3704.23
this person sitting here right now so

3701.31 --> 3708.2799999999997
don't even dream of it it's ridiculous

3704.23 --> 3710.2
dude now I will just remove the trolls

3708.28 --> 3712.9300000000003
it's very simple that's how I do it

3710.2 --> 3715.33
I have done it for a long time it's not

3712.93 --> 3717.22
the first time I've had troll waves okay

3715.33 --> 3720.97
that happened pretty much from the start

3717.22 --> 3722.47
from the first episode on I got a lot of

3720.97 --> 3724.12
trolls and that's fine

3722.47 --> 3727.24
because especially in the start getting

3724.12 --> 3732.19
a lot of trolls means you yeah you're

3727.24 --> 3733.9599999999996
seen so that was actually a good sign I

3732.19 --> 3736.65
guess it's a good sign now even though

3733.96 --> 3736.65
it's very annoying

3739.26 --> 3746.8
no leb it's not a mechanism it's

3743.32 --> 3749.6800000000003
radioactive base it's a radioactive base

3746.8 --> 3752.4
deduction now talking about scientific

3749.68 --> 3755.5899999999997
proof here I'm talking about

3752.4 --> 3759.7000000000003
empirically deducing based on a very

3755.59 --> 3762.4
straightforward mechanism the mechanism

3759.7 --> 3768.16
that can keep track of time in the most

3762.4 --> 3771.07
stable way known to man that is not

3768.16 --> 3773.7999999999997
influenced by other variables like

3771.07 --> 3778.36
forces being applied to it or pressure

3773.8 --> 3780.88
or yeah any kind of those types of

3778.36 --> 3784.09
influences that's why a cesium clock is

3780.88 --> 3787.87
very reliable and stable yet it is it

3784.09 --> 3790.2400000000002
does give variations when you alter the

3787.87 --> 3792.64
height and the pressure is not the

3790.24 --> 3795.1899999999996
influence in this case it is often the

3792.64 --> 3797.77
influence when detecting things or when

3795.19 --> 3801.63
measuring weight and such but weight is

3797.77 --> 3803.48
not a factor in this in this specific

3801.63 --> 3813.26
highlight

3803.48 --> 3815.47
this this data really silly comments

3813.26 --> 3815.4700000000003
here

3816.14 --> 3819.71
[Music]

3820.09 --> 3826.9100000000003
no no dysfunctional empirically deducing

3824.21 --> 3830.06
is not scientific the scientific method

3826.91 --> 3833.99
is scientific it's very specific method

3830.06 --> 3837.83
in which you have to vary the cause the

3833.99 --> 3838.9399999999996
independent variable right and there's a

3837.83 --> 3841.2799999999997
lot of things that can't be

3838.94 --> 3847.04
scientifically proven because you cannot

3841.28 --> 3850.2200000000003
possibly varied the cause so you are

3847.04 --> 3852.92
left with empirical deduction which is

3850.22 --> 3857.6299999999997
the next best thing even though not as

3852.92 --> 3860.35
solid as scientific evidence and that's

3857.63 --> 3860.35
what I like to stick to

3861.41 --> 3864.6299999999997
[Music]

3873.91 --> 3880.69
I don't know why I have to fresh you

3876.52 --> 3883.12
Masada right first you start asking okay

3880.69 --> 3885.85
questions and now you're just being an

3883.12 --> 3889.0899999999997
ass would you like to be banned is this

3885.85 --> 3891.0699999999997
your exit or you just couldn't help

3889.09 --> 3894.15
being an ass for a moment that's fine

3891.07 --> 3894.15
you know

3897.849 --> 3901.349
just don't do that

3902.76 --> 3909.2700000000004
yeah that's right loken it's the are we

3906.25 --> 3912.73
nyan method not the scientific method

3909.27 --> 3918.49
empirical deduction no claims of science

3912.73 --> 3920.41
but yeah it's widely deduced with and

3918.49 --> 3923.91
the empirical part is very important

3920.41 --> 3927.6299999999997
because you have to actually be able to

3923.91 --> 3932.2599999999998
have real observations or tangible

3927.63 --> 3935.92
evidence of some kind as part of the of

3932.26 --> 3938.71
the idea the concept in order for it to

3935.92 --> 3940.359
be an empirical deduction otherwise

3938.71 --> 3943.18
you're just gonna have a theoretical

3940.359 --> 3947.14
deduction if you're going to speculate

3943.18 --> 3950.319
about things billions of miles away that

3947.14 --> 3952.93
you can possibly reach at any point or

3950.319 --> 3955.21
within your lifetime then yeah that that

3952.93 --> 3957.569
is pure theory but when you actually

3955.21 --> 3959.92
have field confirmation of some kind

3957.569 --> 3962.109
observations field confirmation that's

3959.92 --> 3967.349
when it becomes a empirical deduction

3962.109 --> 3967.3489999999997
based concept so

3969.45 --> 3975.75
hmm yeah by the way you show has been

3972.599 --> 3977.549
going for over an hour it's been good

3975.75 --> 3981.0
but the flutter debates have already

3977.549 --> 3985.619
started up I think so I'm gonna run out

3981.0 --> 3987.99
the show it's been interesting and yeah

3985.619 --> 3992.1600000000003
thanks for everyone for coming including

3987.99 --> 3996.299
the newcomers and some of the slightly

3992.16 --> 3998.3089999999997
more behaving trolls it's fine it can be

3996.299 --> 4004.24
somewhat of an ass just don't overdo it

3998.309 --> 4008.75
and yeah questions is always good so

4004.24 --> 4011.8089999999997
yeah thanks hashtag me fine deed I stack

4008.75 --> 4017.27
me if I don't forget about it and I'm

4011.809 --> 4019.28
talking mostly to myself now yeah and

4017.27 --> 4021.049
yeah newcomers you can figure out what

4019.28 --> 4025.46
that means or you can try to look it up

4021.049 --> 4030.2599999999998
at the hashtag meifa episode feel if you

4025.46 --> 4032.63
really want to know but yeah I'm gonna

4030.26 --> 4033.53
run out the show so thanks everyone for

4032.63 --> 4035.119
coming please

4033.53 --> 4038.7400000000002
up for the video if you liked it or

4035.119 --> 4042.349
download it if your assignment and fan

4038.74 --> 4044.6299999999997
or if you are troll whatever seems to be

4042.349 --> 4047.6600000000003
a lot of newcomers but that's how I do

4044.63 --> 4049.309
it and yeah subscribe to my channel if

4047.66 --> 4050.96
you haven't already and thanks for the

4049.309 --> 4052.76
all the new subscribers for subscribing

4050.96 --> 4055.25
don't forget to hit the bell

4052.76 --> 4059.809
notification because yeah sometimes I go

4055.25 --> 4064.22
a little bit earlier on I go life a

4059.809 --> 4065.63
little bit earlier and yeah you don't

4064.22 --> 4067.52
want to miss out on the first few

4065.63 --> 4071.1800000000003
minutes when I go early because that
