128.879 --> 134.72
it was again like i predicted yes

131.52 --> 137.59900000000002
yesterday evening raining

134.72 --> 137.599
but it isn't now

138.56 --> 144.31900000000002
it's still clouded but there's less of

140.8 --> 147.36
him nice blue sky in between still some

144.319 --> 151.28
trails happening up there but

147.36 --> 155.59900000000002
because of the wind i i reckon

151.28 --> 155.599
it does like feather out pretty quickly

155.84 --> 158.8
so yeah

157.28 --> 161.599
nice sunny

158.8 --> 161.59900000000002
a bit windy

163.2 --> 169.2
and yeah

165.599 --> 171.51899999999998
in the wind it's not too warm but

169.2 --> 175.67999999999998
could be worse

171.519 --> 175.68
ejected temperature ah no

181.68 --> 187.20000000000002
really it froze the entire way

184.48 --> 190.159
and i didn't hear anything that's just

187.2 --> 190.159
that's just great

190.4 --> 194.20000000000002
and nobody in chat

194.83 --> 197.959
[Music]

198.959 --> 201.599
try again

209.84 --> 214.08
right so now you know what it looks like

214.56 --> 218.799
see up there there's a bit of a wind

216.64 --> 221.599
feather

218.799 --> 221.59900000000002
from trails

224.239 --> 227.239
anyway

233.72 --> 237.389
[Music]

252.84 --> 259.28000000000003
right where is everybody

256.079 --> 261.519
now i'm starting late

259.28 --> 261.51899999999995
but

262.56 --> 265.68
it's friday

264.32 --> 270.12
friday the

265.68 --> 270.12
27th of may 2022

275.68 --> 280.6
still waiting for anybody to pop in chat

287.12 --> 292.919
hi clutch first in chat hello

302.479 --> 306.4
it is 17 degrees right now

304.96 --> 308.479
right

306.4 --> 311.12
here

308.479 --> 314.0
so how are you all doing

311.12 --> 314.0
are you doing clutch

320.639 --> 325.72
yeah yesterday's show was kind of lame

325.84 --> 330.0
not very high energy and it wasn't super

327.84 --> 333.19899999999996
high energy either like in

330.0 --> 334.639
in the flat earth debate either

333.199 --> 336.56
i think today is probably going to be a

334.639 --> 338.56
bit better but still

336.56 --> 341.44
still have that weird

338.56 --> 341.44
tired feeling

344.39 --> 348.639
[Music]

346.72 --> 350.84000000000003
but maybe that's to be expected because

348.639 --> 355.12
i did kind of like

350.84 --> 355.11999999999995
peak a few days ago

355.44 --> 359.44
i was like really heavy dreaming and all

358.0 --> 361.12
that

359.44 --> 362.71999999999997
dream walking with a lot of fractal

361.12 --> 365.039
thinking

362.72 --> 367.36
and then after that usually when i hit

365.039 --> 369.36
the peak i do get kind of tired

367.36 --> 372.0
[Music]

369.36 --> 374.96000000000004
hey amanda young good see you

372.0 --> 374.96
seven degrees

376.08 --> 381.84
that's not a lot

378.56 --> 381.84
for late may

383.54 --> 386.72
[Music]

399.4 --> 404.25
[Music]

416.08 --> 419.28
right

416.96 --> 423.35999999999996
so yeah yesterday

419.28 --> 425.599
letters debates not super remarkable

423.36 --> 425.599
uh

426.4 --> 430.88
jim bob was pretty good brenda got on

434.84 --> 440.0
again and uh yeah i was uh

438.16 --> 442.319
basically responding and [ __ ] brandon's

440.0 --> 444.88
constantly whining about wanting to go

442.319 --> 446.96000000000004
debate me like no brenda i don't want to

444.88 --> 449.039
debate you

446.96 --> 451.12
like i've already debated you in the

449.039 --> 453.599
past it's a complete waste of my time

451.12 --> 458.319
and my skill

453.599 --> 460.88
because i don't want to have a gamma off

458.319 --> 463.52000000000004
i mean technically i could

460.88 --> 466.08
in a very specific circumstances like

463.52 --> 468.639
improvised in the moment but

466.08 --> 470.639
i know that's what it going to be

468.639 --> 473.36
with brenda

470.639 --> 475.919
i don't trust her i know she just dead

473.36 --> 480.08000000000004
on lies like

475.919 --> 483.12
really deep lies i don't wanna

480.08 --> 483.12
i don't wanna interact

484.319 --> 489.599
but she insists

486.72 --> 492.16
and yeah i don't care

489.599 --> 494.71999999999997
not even gonna debate her on jim bob's

492.16 --> 495.91900000000004
like i don't care i literally there's

494.72 --> 499.59900000000005
nothing

495.919 --> 499.599
that could be set between us

500.479 --> 504.96
that's gonna be

502.24 --> 506.879
really useful

504.96 --> 509.599
because she's not gonna ask me the

506.879 --> 511.52000000000004
questions that i

509.599 --> 514.159
actually have

511.52 --> 517.8389999999999
useful things to say about

514.159 --> 519.039
and i don't really care

517.839 --> 521.2790000000001
about what

519.039 --> 523.279
she likes to do

521.279 --> 526.399
how she arranges her life or any

523.279 --> 527.12
anything about that at all

526.399 --> 529.48
so

527.12 --> 532.659
a waste of my time

529.48 --> 532.659
[Music]

535.44 --> 538.48
all right yeah clutch is early in the

536.959 --> 543.0799999999999
morning so it will

538.48 --> 543.08
warm up a bit all right

559.48 --> 562.649
[Music]

563.12 --> 569.519
so did any of you watch blueberry

566.72 --> 573.279
i'm gonna keep asking

569.519 --> 573.279
till sunday pretty much

574.72 --> 577.76
a bunch of you are probably going to

576.0 --> 581.04
pick out a good moment somewhere in the

577.76 --> 583.12
weekend where they have all the time

581.04 --> 587.519
and more and are more relaxed to watch

583.12 --> 587.519
it which is i guess recommendable

588.56 --> 592.8
but i do insist that you watch it

594.16 --> 602.24
if you're interested in what i do

597.36 --> 605.12
and you're a follower i really do insist

602.24 --> 607.839
and i want feedback i want to i want you

605.12 --> 610.88
to actually prove

607.839 --> 613.2790000000001
that you have fractal thinking grip

610.88 --> 615.76
on such things

613.279 --> 618.56
and you should have because i've been

615.76 --> 620.8
trying to train everybody into doing

618.56 --> 620.8
that

621.2 --> 623.9200000000001
it's a test

625.76 --> 630.269
uh anyway

627.11 --> 630.269
[Music]

630.32 --> 635.6
seems even some like of my baller

632.56 --> 637.76
commenters actually took note of it

635.6 --> 639.76
right now it's getting very worrisome

637.76 --> 642.079
when ballers

639.76 --> 644.8
in comment sections that usually just

642.079 --> 646.8
whine and nag for years on straight

644.8 --> 648.399
are actually like hey that thanks for

646.8 --> 650.4799999999999
the movie tip

648.399 --> 653.76
i'm gonna watch that

650.48 --> 653.76
it's kind of worrisome

655.2 --> 658.32
i mean

656.24 --> 660.8
they're probably gonna watch it before

658.32 --> 664.32
you guys do which is by the way very

660.8 --> 667.1999999999999
typical if you consider the content of

664.32 --> 668.32
the movie and that's why you gotta watch

667.2 --> 670.72
it

668.32 --> 673.72
this is

670.72 --> 673.72
uh

674.0 --> 676.399
anyway

682.0 --> 687.04
i did like put my dvd

684.72 --> 688.48
off blueberry

687.04 --> 690.8
and i watched it

688.48 --> 692.8000000000001
yeah a bit of it again with some

690.8 --> 695.92
subtitles

692.8 --> 698.16
and yeah there's really very little even

695.92 --> 699.92
ads it's like even part of the movie i

698.16 --> 703.519
guess there's like a whole bunch of talk

699.92 --> 705.519
and the character newly arrived doesn't

703.519 --> 708.16
understand the language

705.519 --> 710.9590000000001
so you don't get any subtitles

708.16 --> 712.639
so the knowledge of what is talked about

710.959 --> 714.8389999999999
is even like

712.639 --> 717.839
part of the

714.839 --> 720.399
movie is something you don't pick up on

717.839 --> 722.24
if you don't get subtitles anyway mine

720.399 --> 725.12
are dutch subtitles which is kind of

722.24 --> 728.24
been weird now like i i really don't

725.12 --> 731.839
watch dutch subtitles i used to as a kid

728.24 --> 734.0
it's how i learned english

731.839 --> 735.36
relatively easy because there was so

734.0 --> 738.0
much english

735.36 --> 741.839
spoken television movies with dutch

738.0 --> 745.44
subtitles that's how i really learned it

741.839 --> 748.0
i think like it helped a lot

745.44 --> 750.48
but now i speak more english than i do

748.0 --> 753.279
dutch so to now have dutch subtitles is

750.48 --> 755.6
like uh oh yeah this is

753.279 --> 758.0
oh yeah dutch

755.6 --> 758.0
anyway

761.35 --> 766.149
[Music]

771.36 --> 775.92
all right so yeah as you can gather by

774.0 --> 778.639
the title i've pretty much drawn a

775.92 --> 778.639
conclusion

779.2 --> 783.5600000000001
about the current thing

795.36 --> 800.32
this is basically the summarization of

798.639 --> 802.399
some of the comments i've been leaving

800.32 --> 805.48
in a whole bunch of places that concern

802.399 --> 805.48
the subject

806.26 --> 809.389
[Music]

813.4 --> 817.289
[Music]

823.08 --> 826.239
[Music]

845.199 --> 849.3599999999999
are you guys

847.12 --> 849.36
all

849.68 --> 857.04
like getting caught up in like the

852.399 --> 859.199
general mood of vacation or something

857.04 --> 861.519
is that what that is

859.199 --> 864.4799999999999
it would make sense timing wise because

861.519 --> 866.48
in this specific like time frame there's

864.48 --> 868.72
going to be a lot of people that are

866.48 --> 871.04
just rounding out their school and stuff

868.72 --> 872.8000000000001
and they're like oh finally

871.04 --> 874.639
ah

872.8 --> 877.5999999999999
we can let it go for a bit and just get

874.639 --> 879.839
goofy is that

877.6 --> 883.12
why you're all just like

879.839 --> 886.32
not paying attention whatsoever and just

883.12 --> 886.32
kind of hanging around

888.079 --> 895.12
ah okay hey pjc net

891.68 --> 895.12
ah you finally watched it

896.48 --> 901.12
did you get the english subtitle did you

898.959 --> 904.3199999999999
manage to get it

901.12 --> 904.32
it is awesome isn't it

904.639 --> 909.44
it's just everything about the whole

907.04 --> 911.5999999999999
movie is beautiful

909.44 --> 914.5600000000001
it just is

911.6 --> 916.88
like every scene is picturesque they

914.56 --> 918.7199999999999
make everything beautiful it's like the

916.88 --> 922.48
beauty is

918.72 --> 924.32
prioritized over like story

922.48 --> 926.639
cohesion even

924.32 --> 928.9590000000001
although there is no like giant plot

926.639 --> 931.839
hole or anything most of it is just not

928.959 --> 933.92
really explained it's just all mystery

931.839 --> 936.32
it's just like oh look at this it looks

933.92 --> 938.0
kind of mysterious and like there is a

936.32 --> 939.759
weird vibe to it

938.0 --> 941.759
but

939.759 --> 944.32
yeah some rumors here and there you

941.759 --> 948.5600000000001
don't get to hear anything else yeah

944.32 --> 952.0400000000001
yeah it's just a mystery you don't know

948.56 --> 952.04
i love that

954.56 --> 959.5189999999999
why not just watch it in english because

956.639 --> 963.839
it's a multilingual movie george sanford

959.519 --> 963.839
there is no all english version

964.399 --> 968.48
i mean most of it is english

966.8 --> 970.4799999999999
but there's a bit of french there's

968.48 --> 972.24
native american

970.48 --> 974.639
i still don't know specifically what

972.24 --> 974.639
tongue

979.04 --> 983.4399999999999
yeah

980.8 --> 985.5999999999999
but yeah an important part is that and

983.44 --> 988.72
native americans speak and there's not

985.6 --> 988.72
gonna be like a

989.839 --> 997.839
like a english overspoken version of it

993.839 --> 1001.519
just isn't there it's part of the

997.839 --> 1001.519
experience anyway

1001.68 --> 1005.4399999999999
the music was composed specially for the

1003.92 --> 1009.7199999999999
music i know

1005.44 --> 1009.72
and it was all awesome

1010.72 --> 1016.0790000000001
the entire movie is like just like a

1013.12 --> 1019.12
giant painting it really is like a giant

1016.079 --> 1019.12
painting the whole thing

1021.12 --> 1024.12
right

1025.039 --> 1028.319
but it is one of those movies that you

1026.88 --> 1030.0
got to watch

1028.319 --> 1031.4389999999999
and then you kind of got to let it go

1030.0 --> 1033.36
again and just

1031.439 --> 1035.28
let it sink to the background and then

1033.36 --> 1036.4799999999998
years later watch it again and just be

1035.28 --> 1039.48
like

1036.48 --> 1039.48
again

1040.559 --> 1045.72
and there's so much deeper thought to it

1058.0 --> 1062.48
right but i'm really glad you at least

1059.84 --> 1066.36
watched it because now i can feel it i

1062.48 --> 1066.3600000000001
can feel it from you

1068.49 --> 1072.14
[Music]

1087.44 --> 1094.64
and you know what's also funny

1091.28 --> 1096.6399999999999
i learned a trick from the movie

1094.64 --> 1100.5590000000002
like what what the

1096.64 --> 1100.5590000000002
indian shaman guy kind of does

1107.12 --> 1110.9599999999998
that's something

1108.559 --> 1112.8799999999999
that actually works

1110.96 --> 1115.52
and i kind of like

1112.88 --> 1117.679
just do that sometimes usually not in

1115.52 --> 1119.9189999999999
front of other people but it is usually

1117.679 --> 1119.919
like

1121.52 --> 1124.799
when there's something really tense and

1123.52 --> 1128.48
personal

1124.799 --> 1132.0
in the air let's just say metaphorically

1128.48 --> 1133.679
like there's tension somebody's like

1132.0 --> 1134.72
really tense

1133.679 --> 1136.48
or

1134.72 --> 1138.72
deep

1136.48 --> 1140.24
then it just like really

1138.72 --> 1142.559
works

1140.24 --> 1144.799
and i don't even like i

1142.559 --> 1148.84
like watching it back was also

1144.799 --> 1152.08
remembering where i got that

1148.84 --> 1153.12
from because i just assimilated it i

1152.08 --> 1157.72
just like

1153.12 --> 1157.7199999999998
i can do that i understand this

1171.28 --> 1174.28
shhh

1188.64 --> 1191.64
anyway

1195.02 --> 1198.279
[Music]

1201.12 --> 1208.0
i really wish i could also do like the

1204.08 --> 1211.4399999999998
very typical native american thing but

1208.0 --> 1214.32
it's it's tougher than it appears to

1211.44 --> 1214.3200000000002
actually do that

1214.559 --> 1220.9189999999999
maybe i have to practice more i'm not

1216.24 --> 1220.919
gonna like try that on air or anything

1233.6 --> 1237.039
but yeah

1235.12 --> 1239.12
look i've always had an affinity for

1237.039 --> 1242.32
like native american

1239.12 --> 1245.6789999999999
culture and spirit spirit stuff

1242.32 --> 1248.48
even like my mother had that and

1245.679 --> 1251.76
yeah she took me to america

1248.48 --> 1254.08
to united states as a baby

1251.76 --> 1256.08
i've got this amazing photo somewhere if

1254.08 --> 1257.84
i can find it back not even sure it's on

1256.08 --> 1260.8799999999999
my computer

1257.84 --> 1262.48
i did show it once

1260.88 --> 1266.1200000000001
it might

1262.48 --> 1266.1200000000001
i think i did

1280.08 --> 1285.12
my photo archive is

1282.88 --> 1288.3200000000002
very elaborate

1285.12 --> 1291.84
i'm glad i somewhat ordered it

1288.32 --> 1291.84
but it's still not ideal

1319.679 --> 1325.0
that yeah i can't find it

1335.2 --> 1337.8400000000001
hmm

1342.72 --> 1347.84
oh wait here it is huh

1344.88 --> 1347.8400000000001
i did have it

1359.6 --> 1364.1589999999999
it's a photo from me as a baby

1362.48 --> 1366.48
with my mom

1364.159 --> 1367.2800000000002
in america

1366.48 --> 1370.08
with

1367.28 --> 1370.08
the locals

1371.6 --> 1374.9189999999999
let's see

1390.32 --> 1393.039
hilarious

1393.12 --> 1396.1589999999999
but yeah

1396.24 --> 1400.24
i think you can tell which one is me

1401.28 --> 1404.48
shouldn't be too difficult

1406.4 --> 1411.8400000000001
but that's yeah that's 90

1409.919 --> 1415.96
80 or 81

1411.84 --> 1415.9599999999998
no it's got to be 90 80.

1439.919 --> 1445.0800000000002
okay sorry evil

1442.08 --> 1445.08
what

1448.32 --> 1452.36
oh god what's this

1478.0 --> 1483.44
sarcasm alert

1480.24 --> 1488.24
yeah it's a terrible thing to say

1483.44 --> 1488.24
even in sarcasm classical homeopath

1492.0 --> 1496.52
that's very pulmonoid of you

1503.12 --> 1506.12
uh

1506.3 --> 1509.49
[Music]

1525.679 --> 1531.3600000000001
no then white evil is not subjective

1530.4 --> 1532.799
but

1531.36 --> 1536.1589999999999
people are

1532.799 --> 1536.96
often a lot more easy to attribute evil

1536.159 --> 1539.0390000000002
to

1536.96 --> 1541.76
natural behavior

1539.039 --> 1544.0
so i'd say that the invention and

1541.76 --> 1549.44
application of the gun

1544.0 --> 1551.279
was really just a a military necessity

1549.44 --> 1553.1200000000001
you're gonna realize that before that

1551.279 --> 1554.72
time

1553.12 --> 1559.6789999999999
war

1554.72 --> 1559.679
and crime was all very freaking bloody

1562.24 --> 1569.2
and guns made it more impersonal but it

1565.36 --> 1571.4399999999998
also made things just go smoother

1569.2 --> 1573.679
compared compared

1571.44 --> 1575.8400000000001
like because seriously like swords and

1573.679 --> 1578.4
spears and shields and walls and all

1575.84 --> 1582.1999999999998
that it works but things get really

1578.4 --> 1582.2
freaking bloody man

1584.0 --> 1589.6
and soldiers like

1586.32 --> 1592.3999999999999
in in areas of a lot of friction and war

1589.6 --> 1593.6789999999999
they turn into like bloody demons they

1592.4 --> 1597.1200000000001
can't help it

1593.679 --> 1600.24
in that time right it constantly like

1597.12 --> 1602.4799999999998
blood gushing on you from your enemy

1600.24 --> 1603.84
dude it's gonna [ __ ] you up

1602.48 --> 1607.1200000000001
more

1603.84 --> 1609.9189999999999
than like being a soldier now with guns

1607.12 --> 1613.52
and like making mistakes or fighting bad

1609.919 --> 1615.76
wars it's all [ __ ] up right but just

1613.52 --> 1618.96
think of it like what if guns hadn't

1615.76 --> 1621.2
been there it would have been even worse

1618.96 --> 1626.3600000000001
so no i don't think that the

1621.2 --> 1626.3600000000001
people that envisioned the gun were evil

1633.12 --> 1640.799
i mean a gun is basically just a really

1636.64 --> 1643.7990000000002
advanced version of throw a rock

1640.799 --> 1643.799
okay

1655.679 --> 1659.44
it's like a rock spear or something

1658.399 --> 1661.76
anyway

1659.44 --> 1661.76
uh

1662.64 --> 1668.24
i never killed anyone but it by its own

1665.76 --> 1670.96
thing i thought you said a gun never

1668.24 --> 1675.96
killed anyone but itself that that would

1670.96 --> 1675.96
be weird but that's not what you said

1684.48 --> 1687.919
right yeah pjs cnet

1689.84 --> 1693.12
yeah

1691.84 --> 1694.08
missiles

1693.12 --> 1697.039
and

1694.08 --> 1698.72
bombards and all that

1697.039 --> 1701.039
are much more

1698.72 --> 1701.039
dark

1701.44 --> 1706.3200000000002
explosives in general are kind of dark

1704.32 --> 1709.039
in nature because

1706.32 --> 1710.96
it's always traumatizing it always just

1709.039 --> 1712.24
destroys rex

1710.96 --> 1714.0
right

1712.24 --> 1717.76
think of it like this the inventor of

1714.0 --> 1724.039
dynamite he got the nobel prize

1717.76 --> 1724.039
because dynamite really was just a mega

1724.159 --> 1727.679
terror

1725.52 --> 1729.9189999999999
i mean yeah it was very easy for

1727.679 --> 1733.919
industry mining and all that yay good

1729.919 --> 1733.919
for you yeah however

1734.08 --> 1739.76
explosives everywhere

1736.64 --> 1742.24
and getting militarized that's really

1739.76 --> 1744.08
a very big destroyer

1742.24 --> 1745.84
much more than

1744.08 --> 1748.37
like ballistics

1745.84 --> 1751.58
ballistics projectiles

1748.37 --> 1751.58
[Music]

1753.75 --> 1756.93
[Music]

1767.84 --> 1770.24
right

1768.64 --> 1772.48
an explosive

1770.24 --> 1774.72
usually causes a lot of collateral

1772.48 --> 1777.679
damage guns

1774.72 --> 1779.44
rarely do i mean they can

1777.679 --> 1781.3600000000001
especially like if you miss and it's

1779.44 --> 1784.3990000000001
crowded or [ __ ] right

1781.36 --> 1787.01
but you know explosives

1784.399 --> 1788.9599999999998
in a crowd will literally always just

1787.01 --> 1791.36
[Music]

1788.96 --> 1792.24
it's just carnage

1791.36 --> 1796.1589999999999
right

1792.24 --> 1800.799
so i'd argue that explosives are really

1796.159 --> 1800.7990000000002
much darker in nature than guns

1801.44 --> 1806.25
not even going to call it evil or

1803.12 --> 1811.6799999999998
anything it's kind of pointless

1806.25 --> 1811.68
[Music]

1812.08 --> 1816.08
right now

1813.12 --> 1819.559

1851.6 --> 1855.08
yeah sorry

1878.88 --> 1883.679
this is ridiculous ben white

1881.2 --> 1886.64
no a line is not evil because it has to

1883.679 --> 1886.64
kill another animal

1888.24 --> 1895.039
evil is not subjective you calling that

1891.84 --> 1898.72
evil is just wrong

1895.039 --> 1898.72
you don't understand evil

1899.679 --> 1902.88
it's nature

1902.96 --> 1908.3990000000001
yeah

1904.08 --> 1908.399
designed by god nature

1909.039 --> 1915.2
and it plays by other rules

1912.88 --> 1916.96
they the animals they play by slightly

1915.2 --> 1919.679
different rules

1916.96 --> 1920.48
by the way that we can fall back into as

1919.679 --> 1923.44
well

1920.48 --> 1924.88
and we try to avoid that it'll usually

1923.44 --> 1927.1200000000001
at all cost

1924.88 --> 1927.1200000000001
right

1927.76 --> 1934.399
it's just another step of functioning

1930.48 --> 1936.88
another part of the ladder

1934.399 --> 1940.799
they're not evil

1936.88 --> 1943.44
lion is not evil a gun is not evil

1940.799 --> 1943.44
a person

1943.919 --> 1950.64
or even well yeah even potentially an

1946.48 --> 1950.64
animal like an animal that's like really

1951.039 --> 1955.6
hurt in its ego for some reason might

1953.6 --> 1957.84
get super sadistic

1955.6 --> 1957.84
right

1958.24 --> 1961.679
it happens

1959.519 --> 1963.279
and they they will like if they have

1961.679 --> 1966.96
like social issues they're getting

1963.279 --> 1969.84
ostracized by their group or something

1966.96 --> 1972.48
they will literally take it out on prey

1969.84 --> 1975.519
and like start torturing them

1972.48 --> 1979.919
okay now you could call that evil

1975.519 --> 1979.919
because basically of what is happening

1983.36 --> 1985.36
but

1984.32 --> 1986.799
that

1985.36 --> 1990.0
like a

1986.799 --> 1993.279
predator hunts an animal to eat it

1990.0 --> 1993.279
that's not evil

1993.679 --> 1997.72
that's just how it works

2012.96 --> 2016.88
right and evil comes with a price

2017.12 --> 2021.6
that's that's the point of it it

2018.84 --> 2023.6
desensitizes you it disconnects you it

2021.6 --> 2025.4399999999998
isolates you

2023.6 --> 2027.76
it hardens you

2025.44 --> 2031.039
this is even biblically described just

2027.76 --> 2031.039
what does evil do

2031.279 --> 2037.44
right so yeah i believe animals can

2035.12 --> 2040.4799999999998
become evil

2037.44 --> 2043.279
they can some can be seduced just like

2040.48 --> 2046.799
people and then they end up in like a

2043.279 --> 2049.76
cycle of addiction to that dark behavior

2046.799 --> 2049.7599999999998
just like people

2051.31 --> 2056.7999999999997
[Music]

2054.399 --> 2059.2
right the problem is is that so many

2056.8 --> 2060.8790000000004
people just don't know how to [ __ ]

2059.2 --> 2063.1189999999997
categorize it

2060.879 --> 2065.359
they're just like it's all evil it's

2063.119 --> 2067.9190000000003
only you have to have large eyes and be

2065.359 --> 2070.3199999999997
surrounded by rainbows

2067.919 --> 2072.3199999999997
and that's only if you do that then it's

2070.32 --> 2075.44
not evil everything that

2072.32 --> 2076.48
deviates from that behavioral pattern is

2075.44 --> 2078.96
evil

2076.48 --> 2081.04
according to some people they're [ __ ]

2078.96 --> 2083.119
insane they literally have no

2081.04 --> 2085.2799999999997
understanding of what the world is how

2083.119 --> 2088.159
it works

2085.28 --> 2090.0
spectrum of behavior nature development

2088.159 --> 2091.599
of the spirit they have no

2090.0 --> 2094.879
grasp

2091.599 --> 2097.28
and those people should not be judging

2094.879 --> 2099.68
what is evil at all they should not be

2097.28 --> 2102.6400000000003
involved in judging what is evil they

2099.68 --> 2105.52
should not be called upon to vote

2102.64 --> 2107.92
on what is evil

2105.52 --> 2110.24
those people should just stay the [ __ ]

2107.92 --> 2110.2400000000002
away

2110.8 --> 2114.8
from getting involved in judgment

2114.88 --> 2119.44
if you don't know how things really work

2120.24 --> 2124.16
and what evil really is

2122.64 --> 2128.3199999999997
and the price

2124.16 --> 2131.2799999999997
in order to recognize it you recognize

2128.32 --> 2133.44
evil by the price

2131.28 --> 2134.6400000000003
yeah

2133.44 --> 2136.0
then

2134.64 --> 2138.3199999999997
if you don't understand that you

2136.0 --> 2141.119
shouldn't even be involved in judgment

2138.32 --> 2141.119
in my opinion

2142.0 --> 2145.839
right unless

2143.76 --> 2148.32
you're very willing to like correct

2145.839 --> 2149.359
yourself in the moment if as you figure

2148.32 --> 2151.839
out

2149.359 --> 2153.92
how you were mistaken and what might

2151.839 --> 2154.96
really be evil

2153.92 --> 2156.88
right

2154.96 --> 2159.119
if you're willing to do that but if

2156.88 --> 2162.2400000000002
you're just there to just know this is

2159.119 --> 2165.119
always evil because this book

2162.24 --> 2167.4399999999996
there's people that oh everybody agrees

2165.119 --> 2170.88
upon that this saying about this part of

2167.44 --> 2173.52
this book that this is evil

2170.88 --> 2176.6400000000003
instead of

2173.52 --> 2177.92
having a much more visceral natural

2176.64 --> 2179.68
based

2177.92 --> 2181.6800000000003
sizing up

2179.68 --> 2185.2799999999997
of how things work out there what is

2181.68 --> 2187.839
really evil what it does to you

2185.28 --> 2187.8390000000004
natural

there's good bad

2202.64 --> 2205.52
good and evil

2212.56 --> 2217.839
no bad is just kind of

2215.2 --> 2221.2799999999997
on its way to evil but it's not just

2217.839 --> 2221.2799999999997
fully committed yet

2223.52 --> 2228.0
right somebody can make an evil mistake

2225.92 --> 2231.599
but still be a good person if they don't

2228.0 --> 2231.599
really realize their mistake

2232.16 --> 2236.16
it's only when they realize their

2233.76 --> 2239.3590000000004
mistake and then still double down up on

2236.16 --> 2240.839
it and willing to let go of all the old

2239.359 --> 2244.0
in order to

2240.839 --> 2247.599
create for that evil that they embrace

2244.0 --> 2247.599
that they truly become evil

2249.44 --> 2253.119
right it's the doubling down

2253.359 --> 2258.7999999999997
after truly understanding that makes it

2256.48 --> 2261.76
evil

2258.8 --> 2263.599
people can be kind of bad

2261.76 --> 2266.0
and those are usually just kind of

2263.599 --> 2267.76
people that just don't know how to get

2266.0 --> 2268.8
themselves in line to make the right

2267.76 --> 2271.8390000000004
choices

2268.8 --> 2274.079
they mostly just ruin it for themselves

2271.839 --> 2276.56
right that's what i would say bad those

2274.079 --> 2280.8
are not evil those are like lost people

2276.56 --> 2280.7999999999997
they're bad news they just wreck things

2281.599 --> 2286.96
they don't do it like a plan to gain

2284.64 --> 2288.96
power they just wreck it because they

2286.96 --> 2291.359
don't have control those are like bad

2288.96 --> 2291.359
news

2293.599 --> 2297.56
right but that's not evil

2300.079 --> 2305.04
evil is with intent and choice

2307.68 --> 2316.56
and whether that choice is cognitive or

2311.76 --> 2316.5600000000004
conscious like in a sensory way

2317.359 --> 2321.92
that doesn't matter it what matters is

2319.28 --> 2324.4
that the consciousness aligns

2321.92 --> 2327.56
to the decision that's what truly makes

2324.4 --> 2327.56
it evil

2335.2 --> 2339.7599999999998
keeping it a bit vague

2337.28 --> 2342.6400000000003
but this should apply

2339.76 --> 2345.3590000000004
doing my best to give

2546.88 --> 2551.92
have like rifles and all that

2549.28 --> 2554.5600000000004
it's all super controlled and registered

and they have to

2554.72 --> 2560.72
go through hoops and checks and whatever

2558.16 --> 2562.48
i mean it is still possible but it is

2560.72 --> 2565.839

be people just virtue sick like and it's

2702.72 --> 2707.04

americans should be very happy with

2707.04 --> 2710.079
their second amendment

2713.44 --> 2717.359

use it in a crisis situation then you're

2752.48 --> 2758.48
do have a p900 i have it's kind of in a

2755.68 --> 2760.72
few years ago now

2758.48 --> 2764.16
but there's no use

2760.72 --> 2765.359
i i'm i can't like show close-ups of the

2764.16 --> 2766.8799999999997
moon

2765.359 --> 2769.839
to prove

2766.88 --> 2773.8
it's not physical

2769.839 --> 2773.7999999999997
it doesn't really help

2774.079 --> 2779.92
besides there is like

2776.319 --> 2779.92
plenty of footage out there

2781.839 --> 2785.359
have you ever fired a gun

2785.68 --> 2788.72
i'm not sure

2787.599 --> 2792.3590000000004
maybe

2788.72 --> 2792.359
maybe one time

2807.68 --> 2811.04
second amendment was written they ever

2809.359 --> 2813.2
envisioned

2811.04 --> 2816.0
but there is now compared to a musket oh

2813.2 --> 2817.9199999999996
no no logical conclusion that's not a

2816.0 --> 2821.76
very logical conclusion because they

2817.92 --> 2824.079
definitely envisioned what would happen

2821.76 --> 2826.4
oh yes

2824.079 --> 2828.6400000000003
i mean in that time they already had

2826.4 --> 2828.64
like

2829.119 --> 2833.28
bombards and all that

2831.52 --> 2836.079
right

2833.28 --> 2837.2000000000003
muskets bombards

2836.079 --> 2839.76
cannons

2837.2 --> 2841.9199999999996
oh yeah you bet your ass they could

2839.76 --> 2845.2000000000003
absolutely figure out what that would

2841.92 --> 2848.079
eventually develop into oh yes also they

2845.2 --> 2849.1189999999997
had like weird bottle rockets

2848.079 --> 2851.04
as well

2849.119 --> 2853.839
dude they tried so many things in that

2851.04 --> 2856.079
era oh yeah you could bet your ass they

2853.839 --> 2856.839
could envision what it would turn into

2856.079 --> 2858.6400000000003
over

2856.839 --> 2860.7999999999997
time

2858.64 --> 2864.16
so to say oh no they just were for the

2860.8 --> 2865.92
muskets no no it wasn't they absolutely

2864.16 --> 2869.2
knew about like

2865.92 --> 2870.16
technological development and warfare

2869.2 --> 2874.72
yeah

2870.16 --> 2874.72
they knew it was gonna improve a lot

2875.359 --> 2880.64
it already had improved a lot even in

2877.76 --> 2880.6400000000003
their lifetimes

2880.96 --> 2886.48
they're not stupid these people

2883.68 --> 2888.7999999999997
that like created the founding fathers

2886.48 --> 2891.8
they they really did have a long-term

2888.8 --> 2891.8
vision

2908.559 --> 2911.3590000000004
yeah good point

2911.76 --> 2916.8
if the moon was physical you would be

2913.359 --> 2916.7999999999997
able to detect it that's right

2917.839 --> 2923.119
when it's just gone for three days

2920.0 --> 2923.119
entirely gone

2923.44 --> 2929.28
right and you would have some kind of

2925.2 --> 2931.359
radio signal bounce

2929.28 --> 2933.52
situation going which there isn't

2931.359 --> 2937.5989999999997
despite like a whole bunch of just

2933.52 --> 2940.0
raving lunatic gammas keep instead

2937.599 --> 2941.839
in insisting

2940.0 --> 2944.48
that it that that's actually out there

2941.839 --> 2944.48
it isn't

2944.64 --> 2949.92
but there are probably wizards organized

2947.76 --> 2952.0
to specifically

2949.92 --> 2954.319
show you a setup to convince you that

2952.0 --> 2956.8
they are

2954.319 --> 2960.319
if you really need that reinsurance to

2956.8 --> 2961.599
reinforce your own delusional worldview

2960.319 --> 2964.079
right

2961.599 --> 2966.2400000000002
but you can't actually do it

2964.079 --> 2967.8390000000004
if you could then people would be doing

2966.24 --> 2970.64
it and they would be showing a

2967.839 --> 2973.04
demonstration of that setup that they

2970.64 --> 2974.64
laid out with multiple cameras

2973.04 --> 2977.52
showing a

2974.64 --> 2979.2799999999997
digital screen readout of the signal

2977.52 --> 2980.96
situation

2979.28 --> 2984.7200000000003
a hand view

2980.96 --> 2987.76
or the person aiming the radio signal

2984.72 --> 2990.319
and then seeing the moon in the distance

2987.76 --> 2992.4
and then a camera view on it all to see

2990.319 --> 2994.0
that it's actually all life happening

2992.4 --> 2996.64
together

2994.0 --> 2999.28
and then the person aims the radio

2996.64 --> 3002.319
signal at the moon oh look the readout

2999.28 --> 3005.0400000000004
is now showing there's a feedback aiming

3002.319 --> 3008.079
away oh it's gone oh it's there it's

3005.04 --> 3009.119
gone it's there it's gone right

3008.079 --> 3010.88
that's

3009.119 --> 3014.079
actually

3010.88 --> 3015.6800000000003
viable clues a viable

3014.079 --> 3017.92
source of proof

3015.68 --> 3020.16
like hey there is some interaction

3017.92 --> 3022.2400000000002
specifically with the moon

3020.16 --> 3024.5589999999997
because if i aim it not at the moon it

3022.24 --> 3026.8799999999997
doesn't do that yeah that's what you

3024.559 --> 3029.8390000000004
would need that's not what's out there

3026.88 --> 3033.359
at all nothing like that no very

3029.839 --> 3036.48
variation no no actual freaking sight of

3033.359 --> 3039.359
a moon in any of those videos you don't

3036.48 --> 3042.2400000000002
actually see the moon in not a single

3039.359 --> 3044.0
freaking example of that they don't even

3042.24 --> 3046.9599999999996
show the moon in those videos

3044.0 --> 3048.559
supposingly doing it it's [ __ ] if

3046.96 --> 3050.8
you believe in that

you're an idiot you're gullible

if you believe that that's real

3055.52 --> 3058.319
yeah

so

3058.319 --> 3063.7599999999998
i don't need like close-ups of the moon

3061.76 --> 3066.8
to try and prove it's

3063.76 --> 3066.8
like holographic

3066.88 --> 3070.48
that that's kind of pointless

3070.72 --> 3075.04
unless i like happen to catch a moon

3072.88 --> 3077.28
ripple but i doubt that i'd i'd be able

3075.04 --> 3079.599
to even keep my camera still enough to

3077.28 --> 3082.3100000000004
to get that to be lucky enough to catch

3158.559 --> 3161.119
camera

3159.599 --> 3163.6800000000003
and they're like you're seeing the hand

3161.119 --> 3166.559
aiming it and it's like yeah there's the

3163.68 --> 3169.2
moon if there's a physical thing there

3166.559 --> 3174.48
that's getting in between the bounds

3169.2 --> 3174.48
you're going to see that physical thing

3175.599 --> 3180.28
this is

3176.96 --> 3180.28
kind of silly

3206.72 --> 3208.72
no

3207.76 --> 3211.119
i mean

3208.72 --> 3212.7999999999997
maybe it could be they could figure out

3211.119 --> 3215.2000000000003
how to turn it into a freaking

3212.8 --> 3217.04
magician's trick and then fool everybody

3215.2 --> 3219.7599999999998
again but the thing is that if you're

3217.04 --> 3221.599
not a magician trying to trick everybody

3219.76 --> 3223.76
into believing it's real

3221.599 --> 3226.1600000000003
and you would actually do it you would

3223.76 --> 3230.7200000000003
show that it isn't happening

3226.16 --> 3232.96
you can aim your freaking radio whatever

3230.72 --> 3235.2799999999997
to the moon

3232.96 --> 3236.8
and there's not going to be a difference

3235.28 --> 3239.28
you're not going to have a signal

3236.8 --> 3243.76
rebounds it's it's all

3239.28 --> 3243.76
fantasy it's all make believe nonsense

3244.079 --> 3246.6400000000003
by

3245.359 --> 3250.48
by the way

3246.64 --> 3252.319
by radio owners right remember

3250.48 --> 3255.599
radio

3252.319 --> 3258.72
kind of the exclusive territory

3255.599 --> 3260.7200000000003
of globe religion

3258.72 --> 3263.2799999999997
i mean

3260.72 --> 3266.16
that's who's doing it all pretty much

3263.28 --> 3268.4
she was upholding the story and

3266.16 --> 3271.2799999999997
you know communication

3268.4 --> 3271.28
storytelling

3275.82 --> 3278.96
[Music]

3277.119 --> 3281.6800000000003
radar during a new moon yeah well that

3278.96 --> 3281.68
would be interesting

3285.119 --> 3290.799
or what about an infrared camera

3288.96 --> 3293.359
i mean

3290.799 --> 3295.28
infrared cameras even pick up the moon

3293.359 --> 3296.16
whatever it is

3295.28 --> 3297.6800000000003
right

3296.16 --> 3301.44
would you see

3297.68 --> 3304.0789999999997
the new moon with an infrared camera

3301.44 --> 3307.359
it's like you would have to if it's

3304.079 --> 3308.88
actually an object that has some

3307.359 --> 3312.24
temperature

3308.88 --> 3312.2400000000002
you would have to see it

3312.64 --> 3314.8799999999997
right

3316.96 --> 3320.64
isn't that the whole point of like

3318.64 --> 3323.44
infrared

3320.64 --> 3327.68
is that you're not typically subjected

3323.44 --> 3327.68
to typical light issues

3329.2 --> 3334.96
it bends less and all that so you should

3332.48 --> 3336.799
be able to just see it right just like

3334.96 --> 3339.119
the infrared views

3336.799 --> 3340.319
in a in a plane

3339.119 --> 3343.52
high up

3340.319 --> 3346.96
right and then you get these incred

3343.52 --> 3348.96
incredible far distant views

3346.96 --> 3350.96
or if you can see that with an infrared

3348.96 --> 3353.28
then what's preventing you from actually

3350.96 --> 3355.04
picking up the moon with infrared

3353.28 --> 3357.0400000000004
during a new moon when you can't

3355.04 --> 3359.119
visually see it you would be able to

3357.04 --> 3361.04
pick it up it's an object right it

3359.119 --> 3362.96
should be there whether you can see it

3361.04 --> 3364.96
or not

3362.96 --> 3367.04
infrared should be picking it up because

3364.96 --> 3369.2
there is a temperature there

3367.04 --> 3371.2
it's an object right it has a

3369.2 --> 3373.5989999999997
temperature you should be able to pick

3371.2 --> 3377.839
it up

3373.599 --> 3377.839
right but it's not actually there

3396.64 --> 3400.799
radar imagery of the moon

3401.28 --> 3404.92
oh god

3410.48 --> 3413.839
yeah gorzil of course

3414.16 --> 3420.16
i mean failure to provide evidence has

3417.2 --> 3421.2
never stopped the globe religion before

3420.16 --> 3424.16
right

3421.2 --> 3426.799
they got all the dynamic they need to

3424.16 --> 3428.48
make up excuses as to for why something

3426.799 --> 3430.319
isn't happening right

3428.48 --> 3432.0
it doesn't really matter to them whether

3430.319 --> 3434.079
there's gonna turn out to be proof or

3432.0 --> 3436.4
not they can always find their way

3434.079 --> 3438.6400000000003
through with more [ __ ]

3436.4 --> 3440.88
because they believe

3438.64 --> 3444.839
they believe it has to be more than that

3440.88 --> 3447.92
reality is cohesive in their worldview

3444.839 --> 3452.68
okay so what you get

3447.92 --> 3452.6800000000003
when you deal with religious fanatics

3465.59 --> 3469.8990000000003

3471.52 --> 3476.319
anyway any feedback on my title i'm

3473.68 --> 3480.48
still kind of proud of it

3476.319 --> 3482.64
i mean it is it is just a multi-dynamic

3480.48 --> 3485.119
meme just like this

3482.64 --> 3487.839
it's all true

3485.119 --> 3491.839
right it addresses everything it

3487.839 --> 3492.799
addresses everything

3491.839 --> 3495.119
right

3492.799 --> 3497.68
you see it right

3495.119 --> 3499.52
ban gun free zones to prevent crisis act

3497.68 --> 3502.96
shootings

3499.52 --> 3506.079
i mean that literally says all of it

3502.96 --> 3506.079
every thing

3514.799 --> 3519.2
sorry to switch subjects just

3517.52 --> 3520.799
it was going to be a bit of a short show

3519.2 --> 3524.4399999999996
anyway

3520.799 --> 3528.34
15 more minutes

3524.44 --> 3528.34
[Music]

3530.24 --> 3534.24
you're what what do you mean godzilla

3535.52 --> 3541.359
the moon volcanoes

3539.2 --> 3543.5989999999997
okay tomanoid

3541.359 --> 3546.64
alrighty then

3543.599 --> 3550.88
getting a bit creative there

3546.64 --> 3550.8799999999997
moon volcanoes that's hilarious

3551.76 --> 3556.48
that would be freaky man

3553.839 --> 3557.599
you'd see like a volcanic eruption on

3556.48 --> 3559.76
the moon

3557.599 --> 3563.2000000000003
can you imagine just suddenly all these

3559.76 --> 3566.1600000000003
black clouds spewing forth there

3563.2 --> 3566.16
that'll be weird

3569.599 --> 3574.799
but i presuppose because of course

3572.16 --> 3577.04
that's not gonna happen

3574.799 --> 3577.04
uh

3581.52 --> 3586.72
hope you've seen my

3583.599 --> 3588.1600000000003
my title card or rather the title of my

3586.72 --> 3591.5989999999997
show godzilla that's what i was

3588.16 --> 3595.319
referring to i named it out

3591.599 --> 3595.319
i named it out loud

3627.92 --> 3631.359
what do you think about the cops being

3629.44 --> 3633.44
[ __ ] well

3631.359 --> 3635.44
it all depends on whether it was

3633.44 --> 3639.359
completely fake and they were just like

3635.44 --> 3641.28
oh it's just another drill or something

3639.359 --> 3643.2
and then they supposedly went hot

3641.28 --> 3645.3590000000004
officially

3643.2 --> 3645.359
but

3646.64 --> 3651.359
i don't know if anything happened at all

3649.52 --> 3654.079
but yeah if they did then they were

3651.359 --> 3657.359
absolute wussies and they should not be

3654.079 --> 3658.96
allowed to have a guard job ever again

3657.359 --> 3660.319
i mean that's literally what they're

3658.96 --> 3663.2
being paid for

3660.319 --> 3665.359
and and then they literally blew it they

3663.2 --> 3668.0
should never have a job in that field

3665.359 --> 3668.0
ever again

3669.76 --> 3673.2000000000003
i mean

3670.72 --> 3676.9599999999996
just go

3673.2 --> 3676.96
like clean sewers or something

3681.52 --> 3684.4
amazing

3682.839 --> 3685.54
title

3684.4 --> 3690.23
thanks

3685.54 --> 3690.23
[Music]

3697.68 --> 3702.8799999999997
you think a fighter jet should be

3699.44 --> 3702.88
covered on the second amendment

3708.48 --> 3714.799
that's a bit complicated though

3712.4 --> 3718.48
maybe but yeah you're still gonna have

3714.799 --> 3718.48
like all kinds of hazards i mean

3723.44 --> 3727.28
there's a lot of things that could go

3724.96 --> 3727.28
wrong

3766.559 --> 3768.88
oh

3767.44 --> 3771.76
really

3768.88 --> 3773.2000000000003
what's my thoughts on iq testing

3771.76 --> 3776.0
it's

3773.2 --> 3778.16
kind of pointless really

3776.0 --> 3779.52
i mean

3778.16 --> 3782.799
it's just

3779.52 --> 3785.2
testing pretty much for quickness and

3782.799 --> 3787.599
like pattern recognition

3785.2 --> 3789.9199999999996
but that's really just a very limited

3787.599 --> 3792.96
range of skills

3789.92 --> 3793.76
that you can do with your mind

3792.96 --> 3797.599
right

3793.76 --> 3799.8390000000004
so iq tests are basically like extremely

3797.599 --> 3801.76
underdeveloped

3799.839 --> 3805.119
although there have been like other

3801.76 --> 3807.28
attempts like eq tests and all that

3805.119 --> 3808.7200000000003
to check for other things but it's all

3807.28 --> 3810.4
look

3808.72 --> 3812.24
it's basically developed by the same

3810.4 --> 3816.0
people that

3812.24 --> 3819.68
have devised psychiatry and all that

3816.0 --> 3824.359
so it's kind of psychological founded

3819.68 --> 3824.359
it's not as effective as it could be

3827.119 --> 3829.76
i mean

3828.24 --> 3832.64
real

3829.76 --> 3835.6800000000003
talent and effectiveness

3832.64 --> 3838.5589999999997
aren't as easily categorized within a

3835.68 --> 3841.0389999999998
simple test

3838.559 --> 3844.48
it just doesn't really work like that

3841.039 --> 3848.6400000000003
right a lot of it has to do with

3844.48 --> 3850.96
morality your social cohesion

3848.64 --> 3853.52
and responses with other people like in

3850.96 --> 3855.68
the actual moment not like being asked a

3853.52 --> 3856.88
theoretical question

3855.68 --> 3859.68
right

3856.88 --> 3863.119
it's it's that simple really it's like

3859.68 --> 3863.9199999999996
yeah you can be really theoretical

3863.119 --> 3866.1600000000003
very

3863.92 --> 3868.7200000000003
detailed

3866.16 --> 3870.0789999999997
but like not really practical not really

3868.72 --> 3873.2
know how to

3870.079 --> 3875.44
actually get people to to join you in an

3873.2 --> 3878.0789999999997
idea or to do something or

3875.44 --> 3882.7200000000003
to just be liked right

3878.079 --> 3882.7200000000003
those two can contrast enormously

3883.52 --> 3889.28
and a lot of actual practical skills do

3886.64 --> 3891.68
come from the ability to deal with other

3889.28 --> 3891.6800000000003
people

3892.839 --> 3897.68
so

3894.64 --> 3901.5989999999997
iq test is kind of a bit of a relic to

3897.68 --> 3901.5989999999997
me it doesn't really prove much

3904.319 --> 3908.88
it's like oh this is your processor

3906.319 --> 3910.64
speed goody

3908.88 --> 3914.039
doesn't really say much

3910.64 --> 3914.0389999999998
beyond that

3930.079 --> 3934.76
what matthew

3931.76 --> 3934.76
what

3943.359 --> 3948.4
all right yeah yeah i don't care

3946.079 --> 3948.4
yeah

3949.52 --> 3954.559
i'm all for just legalizing fire jets

3952.319 --> 3957.2799999999997
everybody should own at least one fire

3954.559 --> 3959.119
jet in the united states

3957.28 --> 3962.0
but you kind of have to pay your own

3959.119 --> 3964.6400000000003
fuel do your own maintenance and pay for

3962.0 --> 3965.52
the insurance if you ever crash it

3964.64 --> 3967.839
so

3965.52 --> 3967.839
yeah

3968.079 --> 3971.44
is that worth the investment

3973.52 --> 3978.96
have you ever thought of becoming a

3976.839 --> 3981.119
psychologist yeah

3978.96 --> 3983.44
but then i realized like what it

3981.119 --> 3985.92
actually what they do to you if you want

3983.44 --> 3987.52
to be become part of that

3985.92 --> 3990.0
and then i

3987.52 --> 3991.599
very gladly declined

3990.0 --> 3995.359
so i am

3991.599 --> 3997.6800000000003
a layman psychologist you could say

3995.359 --> 3998.799
or shaman or whatever however you want

3997.68 --> 4001.2
to see it

3998.799 --> 4003.7599999999998
i do it my own way i i don't want a

4001.2 --> 4006.48
paper i don't want to official i don't

4003.76 --> 4009.599
even want official recognition okay

4006.48 --> 4012.72
like i don't care i don't care for some

4009.599 --> 4012.7200000000003
freaking status

4013.599 --> 4016.1600000000003
if people

4017.28 --> 4020.7200000000003
really care

4018.64 --> 4023.1189999999997
then they can figure out what i can do

4020.72 --> 4023.1189999999997
for them

4025.039 --> 4029.2000000000003
if you're just looking for some person

4027.039 --> 4032.079
with status

4029.2 --> 4033.52
that you could trust in this age good

4032.079 --> 4035.44
luck with that

4033.52 --> 4037.599
you can find all the people with all the

4035.44 --> 4040.48
papers in the world are they going to

4037.599 --> 4040.48
actually help you

4041.359 --> 4045.119
yeah well that's another matter isn't it

4045.599 --> 4048.88
now these people with their papers are

4047.44 --> 4051.76
all so

4048.88 --> 4053.76
railroaded

4051.76 --> 4056.3190000000004
they're not even doing what they really

4053.76 --> 4058.079
wanted to do in the first place in that

4056.319 --> 4060.4
trade

4058.079 --> 4063.8390000000004
most of them because they're just

4060.4 --> 4063.839
grinding income

4064.079 --> 4069.52
yeah i don't want to do that i want to

4066.96 --> 4071.359
actually be effective i want to actually

4069.52 --> 4073.839
help people understand things and heal

4071.359 --> 4075.5989999999997
themselves and get on with their life

4073.839 --> 4077.92
right i don't give a [ __ ] about the

4075.599 --> 4080.1600000000003
money i just want to be effective

psychological warfare

pharmaceuticals

4146.96 --> 4150.799
terrible

4148.4 --> 4153.2789999999995
management policies that derail their

4150.799 --> 4155.359
life and constantly overburden them and

4153.279 --> 4158.56
stress them and make them

4155.359 --> 4162.4800000000005
not get a grip on their life

4158.56 --> 4162.4800000000005
that's what kills most americans

4162.88 --> 4166.2390000000005
yeah

4163.759 --> 4168.239
not guns

4166.239 --> 4171.3589999999995
you know how many people like that die

4168.239 --> 4174.5599999999995
in switzerland where everybody mandatory

4171.359 --> 4176.97
has like an armament

4174.56 --> 4179.1990000000005
they have like a vault

serious weaponry yeah you know how many

4183.679 --> 4187.1990000000005
people die there on the streets

4185.279 --> 4190.1990000000005
percentile wise

4187.199 --> 4193.759
very little because they don't literally

4190.199 --> 4195.599999999999
psychologically attack their own people

4193.759 --> 4197.44
to try to take all that away from it

4195.6 --> 4198.88
because it is of the state that they

4197.44 --> 4201.199
have that

4198.88 --> 4202.8
literally mandatory yeah now that's a

4201.199 --> 4205.678999999999
world of difference

4202.8 --> 4208.96
it's a psychological warfare that kills

4205.679 --> 4211.12
the people not the guns not the guns

4208.96 --> 4213.52
being there it's the psychological

4211.12 --> 4215.76
warfare

4213.52 --> 4217.76
that's what kills the people that is

4215.76 --> 4222.08
what causing what is causing all the

4217.76 --> 4223.280000000001
hysteria and deaths and drug addicts and

4222.08 --> 4226.4
crazy

4223.28 --> 4228.159
satanically obsessed freaks that nobody

4226.4 --> 4231.12
does anything about

4228.159 --> 4234.08
know about ahead of time and then let

4231.12 --> 4236.159
them do it all

4234.08 --> 4237.5199999999995
knowingly

4236.159 --> 4240.879999999999
yeah

4237.52 --> 4244.120000000001
psychological warfare not the presence
