Richard first in chat good to see

139.92 --> 145.48
you all

141.76 --> 147.92

yesterday mild

151.44 --> 156.959
kind of clouded but not super thick or

155.0 --> 159.12
anything it might like the way it looks

156.959 --> 159.92000000000002
it might even be a bit Sunny later on

159.12 --> 164.159
who

184.12 --> 190.36
know what that is not yesterday neither

187.44 --> 190.35999999999999
I didn't even notice

192.04 --> 195.04
it

207.04 --> 211.12
[Music]

208.68 --> 212.68
right

211.12 --> 214.879
H yeah I think I'm going to have

212.68 --> 219.28
original drose on again he's like all

214.879 --> 222.959
over my flat Earth early word chat in

219.28 --> 225.319
Skype I think he wants to come on so ah

222.959 --> 225.31900000000002
there he

226.68 --> 230.40900000000002
[Music]

231.64 --> 238.67999999999998
is hey what's up hey hello original D

236.079 --> 241.43900000000002
welcome back how's the

238.68 --> 243.4
sound yeah it sounds good are you not

241.439 --> 245.599
getting any weird feedback or

243.4 --> 248.64000000000001
anything no no I turned down my

245.599 --> 251.76
television where I could see ah right

248.64 --> 255.23899999999998
screen yeah I heard that

251.76 --> 257.799
right you're very you're in very early I

255.239 --> 261.0
just started yeah yeah it's it's

257.799 --> 262.35999999999996
Saturday so um yeah um I had a good

261.0 --> 265.24
sleep I've been getting some good sleep

262.36 --> 266.88
since that scare you know that scare Hy

265.24 --> 271.08
scare the hypertension scare I told you

266.88 --> 272.71999999999997
about oh yeah yeah yeah yeah right

271.08 --> 275.84
and yeah that video yeah I saw that

272.72 --> 277.40000000000003
video before or or another another VAR

275.84 --> 280.44
variation of it but yeah that that's

277.4 --> 283.15999999999997
deep how water communicates how it you

280.44 --> 284.6
know like water I mean you know that's

283.16 --> 287.24
what it say it's everything's in the

284.6 --> 291.47900000000004
water yeah and everything and how you

287.24 --> 293.96000000000004
basically also need the gel state water

291.479 --> 295.479
for your blood vessels and that like

293.96 --> 297.32
that's the type of water that your

295.479 --> 300.28
system's going to gather and if you

297.32 --> 302.08
somehow can't get that that when you get

300.28 --> 304.11999999999995
into like blood pressure problems and

302.08 --> 306.639
all that there you go yeah so that's why

304.12 --> 308.68
I thought it was very relevant for your

306.639 --> 312.96000000000004
problems like you should know about this

308.68 --> 316.0
specifically and exactly use that as a

312.96 --> 318.44
as a rabbit Trail yeah and and the thing

316.0 --> 320.28
about it is that and I don't think you

318.44 --> 321.8
supposed to run away from um I mean you

320.28 --> 324.23999999999995
don't abuse it too much of anything will

321.8 --> 327.28000000000003
hurt you but um sodium or whatever or

324.24 --> 329.16
salt mineral salts it um they're helpful

327.28 --> 332.479
so you don't run away from it just don't

329.16 --> 335.03900000000004
over do because salt is a conduent right

332.479 --> 337.31899999999996
it's for for the water for the

335.039 --> 339.15999999999997
electrical conductive thing that you

337.319 --> 341.08000000000004
said that the video explained how it

339.16 --> 343.0
processes and how it broke down that the

341.08 --> 345.59999999999997
heart is not a pump it's basically just

343.0 --> 348.28
a Vortex it's just kind of like a

345.6 --> 350.16
channel you know like a way for it to

348.28 --> 353.4
just kind of right come through your

350.16 --> 356.08000000000004
body yeah the the blood pumps the heart

353.4 --> 358.23999999999995
right not the other way around and it's

356.08 --> 360.4
all about the blood being in the right

358.24 --> 363.319
condition to do that

360.4 --> 366.67999999999995
to give that electrical charge and hey

363.319 --> 368.56
so funny right like what makes water

366.68 --> 370.16
conduct

368.56 --> 373.12
electricity

370.16 --> 374.56
salt there you go yeah and that and the

373.12 --> 377.28000000000003
salt is probably what makes it get to

374.56 --> 379.199
that gelatin type of formation so

377.28 --> 381.23999999999995
partially I don't know exactly how it

379.199 --> 384.08000000000004
works I think it's like the electrical

381.24 --> 388.12
influence itself that contributes to

384.08 --> 391.12
doing that spark of Life arguably but uh

388.12 --> 393.599
right yes salt is definitely important

391.12 --> 396.599
and also it it all depends on like what

393.599 --> 398.8
type of salt you get though because if I

396.599 --> 401.4
if you give me table salt regular table

398.8 --> 404.68
salt from some restaurant like that

401.4 --> 407.44
stuff like even just a little bit of it

404.68 --> 411.08
on my tongue feels wrong immediately

407.44 --> 416.08
it's like I feel heart cramp like just

411.08 --> 420.19899999999996
touching it but I myself get salt from

416.08 --> 423.19899999999996
this stuff which is La Sal it's a candy

420.199 --> 425.8
and that for some reason I can just

423.199 --> 428.599
engorge an entire roll of this in like

425.8 --> 431.24
15 minutes and I'll have absolutely no

428.599 --> 434.0
problems because it's exactly the right

431.24 --> 436.72
salt for me and it there's all these

434.0 --> 439.4
different types of salt and it all

436.72 --> 442.36
depends on like what your system is what

439.4 --> 444.31899999999996
kind of salt you need yeah and this just

442.36 --> 446.599
happens to be is a coincident that the

444.319 --> 450.03900000000004
salt in this one happens to be really

446.599 --> 451.96
useful for me right and other people

450.039 --> 454.52
might eat like a half a roll and then

451.96 --> 457.75899999999996
like ah call the

454.52 --> 460.15999999999997
ambulance but not me for me it works

457.759 --> 464.159
great what's your opinion on what's your

460.16 --> 467.96000000000004
opinion on this quote sea salt you know

464.159 --> 470.12
this phenomenon sea Sal yeah do you

467.96 --> 472.35999999999996
think do you I love it you could taste

470.12 --> 474.24
the difference too but do you think that

472.36 --> 476.599
some companies have taking advantage of

474.24 --> 479.0
the trend of it and are giving us

476.599 --> 481.36
regular table sort for those who can't

479.0 --> 483.36
dis uish it with their

481.36 --> 485.44
palette no they're not allowed to

483.36 --> 488.0
because it's like that's misbranding

485.44 --> 490.159
that's lying about the product but what

488.0 --> 492.68
they can do is just take sea salt and

490.159 --> 494.68
then just refine it to the absolute

492.68 --> 498.0
minimum standard of being able to call

494.68 --> 499.919
it sea salt when it's basically stable

498.0 --> 503.479
salt at that point they can trick you

499.919 --> 507.84
like that but they can't just take raw

503.479 --> 509.96
which is like pure Atomic salt and then

507.84 --> 512.0799999999999
just call it sea salt because it doesn't

509.96 --> 514.399
have the natural minerals in it what

512.08 --> 515.6800000000001
which is what makes sea salt sea salt

514.399 --> 517.839
it's the minerals that are just

515.68 --> 518.959
naturally in there and of course sea

517.839 --> 521.0
salt is much better than what you're

518.959 --> 523.88
talking about that table salt that table

521.0 --> 527.24
absolutely yeah because without the

523.88 --> 530.88
minerals it is going to literally

527.24 --> 533.6
extract minerals from your body right

530.88 --> 536.0
that is what it'll do cuz they need to

533.6 --> 537.839
be together like the salt and those

536.0 --> 540.64
minerals need to be together that's why

537.839 --> 543.44
they are together in Seas Sal if you

540.64 --> 545.48
then take one component out and you put

543.44 --> 548.8800000000001
it in you then it's going to take that

545.48 --> 552.5600000000001
component from your body right it's not

548.88 --> 555.36
good like it can't be good now I know um

552.56 --> 558.2399999999999
and my wife was she can vouch for this

555.36 --> 560.279
me all sodium and salts I get is from

558.24 --> 562.839
what's already in the food or who

560.279 --> 565.959
prepared it whatever I'm not that guy

562.839 --> 568.6800000000001
that grabs that salt off the table and

565.959 --> 570.92
I'm just not I've never been that guy I

568.68 --> 574.3599999999999
never been that guy pepper yes black

570.92 --> 577.04
pepper garlic yes that's about it that's

574.36 --> 578.519
about it I don't I never like salt the

577.04 --> 580.68
only salt I would get is if I had a

578.519 --> 582.04
potato chip or if I had some you know

580.68 --> 583.92
something that somebody prepared the

582.04 --> 587.079
food with sodium or whatever the

583.92 --> 589.7199999999999
contents inside you know the whatever I

587.079 --> 590.64
ate said sodium you know 100 milligrams

589.72 --> 593.1600000000001
whatever

590.64 --> 594.6
whatever I've never been a tapable salt

593.16 --> 597.12
from the table and just put it on my

594.6 --> 599.8000000000001
food can't stand it and I'm going start

597.12 --> 602.04
leaving a lot of sweets alone too

599.8 --> 604.8
I'm let that go because I'm learning now

602.04 --> 606.279
that it's really the um processed sugar

604.8 --> 609.959
that is the main

606.279 --> 612.56
killer that's causing um the so-called

609.959 --> 615.399
hyper cholesterolemia and all that you

612.56 --> 617.1999999999999
know with the and the tri yeah it's

615.399 --> 620.72
going to mess with your system because I

617.2 --> 622.88
mean refined sugar what it does to your

620.72 --> 626.24
body is it makes it

622.88 --> 629.519
sour and it gives candida like a big

626.24 --> 632.44
chance and that just messes you up yeah

629.519 --> 634.64
it's literally poison yeah like if you

632.44 --> 636.2790000000001
do it bad enough you'll get cancer from

634.64 --> 639.8
it and all that not that you couldn't

636.279 --> 642.4399999999999
get rid of it again but it's just it's n

639.8 --> 644.0
sugar is a nasty poison really and it's

642.44 --> 648.6800000000001
very addictive and that's why they've

644.0 --> 651.68
been using it since the 18th century yep

648.68 --> 654.959
exactly and all people that get it in

651.68 --> 656.92
their diet suddenly get tooth aches and

654.959 --> 659.2399999999999
all kinds of medical issues and Dr

656.92 --> 661.639
Gerson proved that in the early 20s

659.24 --> 664.6800000000001
Century before World War II can you

661.639 --> 668.48
imagine that y Dr Gerson ever heard of

664.68 --> 671.7199999999999
him yeah he has an Institute in Mexico

668.48 --> 675.0
pancreatic cancer pancreatic ad all

671.72 --> 676.76
pancreatis all of that because you it's

675.0 --> 682.68
like your body's processing something

676.76 --> 685.079
that's not you know that's just totally

682.68 --> 687.4399999999999
man-made it's like totally man-made it

685.079 --> 691.2399999999999
only got like maybe like 5% of anything

687.44 --> 693.0790000000001
natural in this process sugar right yeah

691.24 --> 696.519
well the the funny thing is your body

693.079 --> 699.959
does need glucose and all that right but

696.519 --> 702.24
the problem is is that it's not just

699.959 --> 705.04
glucose like Tech technically like

702.24 --> 707.519
things like dextr energy right I never

705.04 --> 710.3199999999999
take that anymore but I used to but that

707.519 --> 712.88
stuff isn't actually bad for you you can

710.32 --> 715.6800000000001
still if you overdo it can still get

712.88 --> 719.32
like yeah issues because of you're just

715.68 --> 722.4799999999999
overdosing on sugar but right the thing

719.32 --> 724.72
is that processed sugar isn't that and

722.48 --> 727.32
it's the funny thing is I learned this

724.72 --> 730.839
like 10 years a wait wait 20 years ago

727.32 --> 734.1600000000001
man time has flown about that they then

730.839 --> 738.12
basically blamed regular sugar and

734.16 --> 740.56
started replacing it with fruit sugars

738.12 --> 744.6
right okay but the problem is is that

740.56 --> 747.7199999999999
the fruit sugars are actually way worse

744.6 --> 749.6
than the glucose sugar well let yeah I

747.72 --> 752.32
had okay I'm tell you two EXP gave all

749.6 --> 753.9200000000001
kinds of we really big health problems

752.32 --> 756.12
at the time when that was like in the

753.92 --> 757.92
organic food industry it was like a

756.12 --> 759.639
whole Trend like oh get all rid of all

757.92 --> 761.7199999999999
the sugar and replace it with fruit

759.639 --> 763.24
sugar but that actually made things

761.72 --> 765.5600000000001
worse for a while and then they kind of

763.24 --> 768.199
took it out again well check this out I

765.56 --> 772.199
have I had two people I knew one guy

768.199 --> 776.639
died he was an older guy than me and he

772.199 --> 778.68
was on this losing weight thing so he

776.639 --> 780.839
found some energy drink and asked me

778.68 --> 783.279
about about I said okay yeah now I wish

780.839 --> 785.6
I would have told him to use it

783.279 --> 788.88
sparingly don't do it the way he

785.6 --> 791.6
apparently did it according to his wife

788.88 --> 794.48
but it shut his organs down his kidneys

791.6 --> 797.639
and everything down he was drinking them

794.48 --> 799.519
like three a day Jes breakfast yeah and

797.639 --> 802.24
then I had another I had another buddy

799.519 --> 804.6
going back to your fruit sugars he's

802.24 --> 808.399
still alive he went on a losing weight

804.6 --> 811.88
thing and he went on a straight fruit he

808.399 --> 813.68
been on fruits for like three days took

811.88 --> 816.8
his sugar to over

813.68 --> 819.6389999999999
600 okay they did the ER said he should

816.8 --> 823.04
not even been

819.639 --> 825.48
alive so they had to detox him and

823.04 --> 829.68
learned his lesson so too much of

825.48 --> 833.1990000000001
anything will will can kill you right

829.68 --> 836.3199999999999
well it's also like if you withdraw from

833.199 --> 838.4799999999999
everything but then overdo one specific

836.32 --> 839.5600000000001
thing there you go that's almost never

838.48 --> 842.759
good

839.56 --> 845.399
no never like maybe with like a water

842.759 --> 847.839
diet that could work right just just

845.399 --> 850.839
water water water and then that's not

847.839 --> 852.6
going to kill you but right but with

850.839 --> 855.36
most other things it's like no never

852.6 --> 856.6800000000001
overdo it on one thing it's never good

855.36 --> 858.6800000000001
unless you got bad kidneys then you

856.68 --> 860.0
don't want to do it or unless you got

858.68 --> 863.04
congestive heart failure then you don't

860.0 --> 865.88
want to do it right you drowned you

863.04 --> 865.88
[ __ ] you freaking

865.92 --> 870.4399999999999
drown yeah I don't know about that so

868.92 --> 872.279
what else is going on

870.44 --> 874.839
man

872.279 --> 877.48
uh well physically I'm kind of doing

874.839 --> 879.519
good I'm I'm going in my own kind of

877.48 --> 883.0
detox because I'm kind of like

879.519 --> 885.5600000000001
involuntary quitting cannabis cuz I just

883.0 --> 888.56
literally can't afford it I need to

885.56 --> 890.279
prioritize buying food and all that

888.56 --> 893.8
right well you know it makes you hungry

890.279 --> 897.04
so then you have to be able to um please

893.8 --> 898.88
that Beast Munch not necessarily I'm

897.04 --> 901.4399999999999
very used to like oh it makes me hungry

898.88 --> 904.48
is like oh yeah I don't give a [ __ ] oh

901.44 --> 906.5600000000001
it'll go away you see if you just don't

904.48 --> 908.279
like oh I got to get snacks if you just

906.56 --> 912.0
ignore that for like half an hour then

908.279 --> 914.32
it just goes away okay so that's not

912.0 --> 916.519
really a problem well I wish I would

914.32 --> 919.0790000000001
have known that before I ate puffy

916.519 --> 921.88
cheese cheese Doodles with dipped in

919.079 --> 924.68
ketchup cuz you you freaking you you it

921.88 --> 927.56
turned a man into a pregnant woman that

924.68 --> 931.7199999999999
good stuff she be having all these weird

927.56 --> 935.2399999999999
um palet salable um desires like cheese

931.72 --> 937.44
puffs with ketchup or grapes with

935.24 --> 939.48
mustard just weird [ __ ] you be like man

937.44 --> 941.6
if you ever tried it but put it together

939.48 --> 942.88
be like no thank you CU if you ate it

941.6 --> 945.8000000000001
when you were sober You' probably throw

942.88 --> 949.56
up but when you're under the Cannabis it

945.8 --> 952.199
has a great great great flavor

949.56 --> 955.1199999999999
combination well you'll be more open to

952.199 --> 957.16
try anything yep that's

955.12 --> 959.24
true and I think that's how one of my

957.16 --> 962.279
buddies long long time ago he ended up

959.24 --> 964.88
having um going into cardiac disease or

962.279 --> 967.519
something because he was a binge smoker

964.88 --> 969.079
I mean every day three times a day and I

967.519 --> 973.16
think he used to just eat things a lot

969.079 --> 975.079
of takeout food you know binge smoker

973.16 --> 976.0
yeah I mean I'm talking about this dude

975.079 --> 978.279
for

976.0 --> 982.079
breakfast after

978.279 --> 984.48
breakfast um you know in between lunch

982.079 --> 987.88
before lunch after lunch you mean like

984.48 --> 989.759
joints and stuff I mean no about like or

987.88 --> 992.6
just cigarettes more than more than no

989.759 --> 994.48
no no no no no cannabis oh okay talking

992.6 --> 996.9200000000001
about cannabis but I'm talking about I

994.48 --> 1000.399
mean it was never a time you wouldn't

996.92 --> 1003.36
see him or smell him and he wasn't

1000.399 --> 1006.04
indulged in and and he have it in his

1003.36 --> 1008.279
hand in his mouth talking to you with M

1006.04 --> 1009.759
hey what's up man how you doing right

1008.279 --> 1012.959
you know or he's rolling up one while

1009.759 --> 1015.9590000000001
he's talking to you you know or he got

1012.959 --> 1017.959
on his ear on standby after he smoked I

1015.959 --> 1019.7589999999999
mean this guy smoked so and I think with

1017.959 --> 1021.8
the smoking he didn't know how to do

1019.759 --> 1023.6
like you and say nah it's just the

1021.8 --> 1025.9189999999999
munchies leave it alone and he would you

1023.6 --> 1028.439
know buy you know Burgers you know just

1025.919 --> 1030.88
different foods to fill that munchie and

1028.439 --> 1032.959
I think that's what got his health down

1030.88 --> 1036.0390000000002
yeah well the if you're going to give

1032.959 --> 1038.3600000000001
into that instinct you could call it's

1036.039 --> 1041.679
not really if you're going to get into

1038.36 --> 1045.3999999999999
that that oh Cravings well you're going

1041.679 --> 1048.48
to end up buying a lot of prefab

1045.4 --> 1050.0800000000002
processed foods and guess what's really

1048.48 --> 1054.44
really bad for

1050.08 --> 1056.6
you that pre prefab processed foods

1054.44 --> 1057.919
right that's like the real problem with

1056.6 --> 1060.76
it is

1057.919 --> 1063.1200000000001
that what you should be doing is like

1060.76 --> 1066.48
smoking it and then like okay I'm going

1063.12 --> 1068.8799999999999
to go cooking now but people get too

1066.48 --> 1071.679
lazy and they don't do it like I

1068.88 --> 1074.88
actually use cannabis as a motivator to

1071.679 --> 1077.799
get to cooking because I get

1074.88 --> 1080.6000000000001
lazy and then if I'm really hungry then

1077.799 --> 1082.72
I really need a good meal and so then I

1080.6 --> 1084.6399999999999
need to cook it and then I'm like ah I'm

1082.72 --> 1087.039
starving I need to make

1084.64 --> 1090.5200000000002
this and so that's how it kind of worked

1087.039 --> 1094.12
for me in the past because like if I

1090.52 --> 1096.96
don't smell cannabis I'll eat less I

1094.12 --> 1099.9599999999998
just I will eat less well I told you

1096.96 --> 1102.159
about the experience I had um two years

1099.96 --> 1104.799
ago about a year or so ago on my

1102.159 --> 1107.7600000000002
birthday and my nephew-in-law

1104.799 --> 1110.24
um had me try something and it was from

1107.76 --> 1113.0
a pipe you know it wasn't from it wasn't

1110.24 --> 1116.28
from tobacco leaf it wasn't you know

1113.0 --> 1119.48
from a a vapor it was from a pipe I saw

1116.28 --> 1121.8799999999999
him take it out it smelled great raw put

1119.48 --> 1126.1200000000001
it in lit it up you know and all it took

1121.88 --> 1128.3200000000002
was like three Puffs man to this day I

1126.12 --> 1130.6399999999999
tell them it had to have I'm

1128.32 --> 1134.039
exaggerating being sarcastic had to had

1130.64 --> 1135.2800000000002
it had to have had fenel in it oh I felt

1134.039 --> 1137.72
like

1135.28 --> 1138.8799999999999
crap I felt like crap I felt like I went

1137.72 --> 1140.72
into a com

1138.88 --> 1142.96
and then I went upstairs and my body

1140.72 --> 1144.76
rejected it but turns out they told me

1142.96 --> 1148.64
you can't do it on an empty stomach and

1144.76 --> 1150.28
then we didn't bro you did it you madman

1148.64 --> 1152.88
but hold up but the guy the first time

1150.28 --> 1155.6789999999999
on an EMP dude no wonder you you didn't

1152.88 --> 1157.96
go this a mirle you didn't pass out or

1155.679 --> 1160.4
something yeah well I did I did kind of

1157.96 --> 1162.64
pass out I did kind of pass out and and

1160.4 --> 1166.1200000000001
I went upstairs and I threw up like

1162.64 --> 1167.7990000000002
three times nothing but dry heaves and

1166.12 --> 1169.9599999999998
what little breakfast I tried to take in

1167.799 --> 1171.32
but remember B smoke I told you about

1169.96 --> 1174.24
that's what he

1171.32 --> 1176.6
did first thing in the morning his

1174.24 --> 1178.76
stomach could first thing in the morning

1176.6 --> 1181.9599999999998
he's hitting it yeah we haven't he

1178.76 --> 1184.799
hasn't even eaten yet right well to be

1181.96 --> 1187.24
fair if you're like a longer smoker

1184.799 --> 1190.12
that's really that doesn't mean anything

1187.24 --> 1192.32
like I smoke a joint like every time

1190.12 --> 1195.32
before the show that's before I've eaten

1192.32 --> 1197.24
usually so I have no problem it's just

1195.32 --> 1198.8799999999999
if it's your first

1197.24 --> 1201.52
time

1198.88 --> 1205.2800000000002
and you do it at an empty stomach like

1201.52 --> 1207.72
that's like a multiplier times 10 to 20

1205.28 --> 1209.76
it's like when you get used to smoking

1207.72 --> 1212.2
it's not that big of a deal anymore but

1209.76 --> 1214.64
if you're not used to it it can be like

1212.2 --> 1216.2
it can actually be dangerous it's like

1214.64 --> 1218.64
this you're not used to smoking you

1216.2 --> 1221.0800000000002
smoke don't get behind the wheel it's

1218.64 --> 1223.88
actually dangerous but if you're used to

1221.08 --> 1225.799
it it's absolutely no problem right so

1223.88 --> 1228.5200000000002
you just got to be careful those that

1225.799 --> 1231.48
first period and mind you my whole mind

1228.52 --> 1233.84
you I've done it in my life before but

1231.48 --> 1236.6

1497.32 --> 1501.1589999999999
over and tipping the table over so it

1499.24 --> 1503.799
falls over so I have to pull the

1501.159 --> 1506.159
umbrella out of the um hole of the table

1503.799 --> 1508.9189999999999
and just lay it down flat ah on the on

1506.159 --> 1511.7600000000002
the on the um on the deck of the um

1508.919 --> 1513.279
balcony but it's good now the winds are

1511.76 --> 1516.96
gusting out that's how that's how I

1513.279 --> 1520.559
destroyed my um I lost my um third

1516.96 --> 1522.52
canopy tent in the backyard wife told me

1520.559 --> 1524.6789999999999
she said it was like there was a time on

1522.52 --> 1526.6
the East Coast like maybe 6 weeks ago

1524.679 --> 1528.679
four four weeks ago where there was

1526.6 --> 1532.36
going to be some terrible winds like 40

1528.679 --> 1534.3200000000002
to 60 70 mile gust winds she told me

1532.36 --> 1536.4799999999998
take the top off you know take the top

1534.32 --> 1539.08
off CU it's velcro strapped on just take

1536.48 --> 1542.3600000000001
the top off yeah secure everything right

1539.08 --> 1544.36
right you tie it down no no no no no no

1542.36 --> 1546.1589999999999
yeah if you need to but check this out

1544.36 --> 1547.9599999999998
though this is what I did wrong this is

1546.159 --> 1550.64
what I did wrong instead of me peeling

1547.96 --> 1552.8400000000001
off the roof which has a little vent in

1550.64 --> 1555.3200000000002
the center but not enough to let the air

1552.84 --> 1557.76
flow it'll literally turn the tent into

1555.32 --> 1559.9189999999999
a kite so instead of me taking her

1557.76 --> 1561.72
advice and peeling that whole roof off

1559.919 --> 1563.279
and just leaving the body frame which is

1561.72 --> 1564.559
metal which a lot of space where the

1563.279 --> 1567.84
wind could just flow right through it

1564.559 --> 1570.799
and not do any harm I secured it while

1567.84 --> 1574.12
it's raining and it's windy I call

1570.799 --> 1577.08
myself putting the spikes in deeper well

1574.12 --> 1579.559
the soil got moist the wind got stronger

1577.08 --> 1581.12
so I was good all through the night and

1579.559 --> 1584.279
then in the morning I'm literally in the

1581.12 --> 1584.279
shower and I hear a

1584.399 --> 1591.0
wind and it just scooped out the dirt

1588.52 --> 1593.559
yeah Che it out I'm I'm in the shower

1591.0 --> 1595.039
and I'm like ah cool I'm like okay it

1593.559 --> 1598.08
lasted through the

1595.039 --> 1600.039
night I hear this loud noise and I hear

1598.08 --> 1603.9189999999999
my wife Go

1600.039 --> 1606.84
Daddy and I'm like oh no don't tell me

1603.919 --> 1607.88
so I looked out the bathroom window and

1606.84 --> 1610.399
it's

1607.88 --> 1613.48
gone so I'm thinking like oh my God it's

1610.399 --> 1616.2399999999998
flying through the sky like Mary Poppins

1613.48 --> 1618.52
it's gonna end up hitting somebody's car

1616.24 --> 1620.6
in the street so I got I got dried up

1618.52 --> 1624.9189999999999
and Dread I ran outside it just blew

1620.6 --> 1626.8799999999999
like 10 15t into my um my um back my

1624.919 --> 1632.24
backyard

1626.88 --> 1634.7990000000002
deck porch deck and um got crushed so I

1632.24 --> 1636.76
just folded it up put it away so now I

1634.799 --> 1639.679
got to get another one and what's funny

1636.76 --> 1642.44
is that I think it's total Karma because

1639.679 --> 1645.3600000000001
the first way I acquired my first one

1642.44 --> 1649.559
was I ordered it online from Home

1645.36 --> 1652.559
Depot and I didn't know how that process

1649.559 --> 1655.6
was so I went to the store and said I'll

1652.559 --> 1657.6
pick up my canopy tent that I ordered

1655.6 --> 1659.799
online while I go get some other things

1657.6 --> 1662.039
cuz I was doing some handyman stuff

1659.799 --> 1663.76
around the house I go to the aisle I

1662.039 --> 1665.84
pick it up I take it with me with the

1663.76 --> 1667.799
other things that I get I pay for the

1665.84 --> 1670.1589999999999
other things and I tell the lady at the

1667.799 --> 1672.36
checkout self checkout oh I already

1670.159 --> 1676.279
bought this online and I show her the

1672.36 --> 1678.039
receipt from my phone not knowing what

1676.279 --> 1682.6
actually happened when I ordered it

1678.039 --> 1687.08
online two days later I get another 10

1682.6 --> 1688.9599999999998
oh so that's that's a familiar process

1687.08 --> 1691.08
that kind of happened with me too it's

1688.96 --> 1693.76
really weird so check this out so my

1691.08 --> 1697.96
wife says take it back and get your

1693.76 --> 1699.24
money back yep now that sounds good

1697.96 --> 1701.799
however I've already set up the first

1699.24 --> 1705.2
tent that I personally picked

1701.799 --> 1707.559
up the first that day remember I took

1705.2 --> 1710.24
one out and set it up it's already in my

1707.559 --> 1712.559
backyard I get one mail two days later I

1710.24 --> 1717.3990000000001
take that one back and get my money back

1712.559 --> 1720.44
so actually I stole a tent no no that's

1717.399 --> 1725.0
no no that's literally no that's abusing

1720.44 --> 1727.0800000000002
an administrative error okay but my ad

1725.0 --> 1729.039
error it's my administrative error

1727.08 --> 1731.0
because if I had known that I ordered it

1729.039 --> 1733.919
and it was sh being shipped in a day or

1731.0 --> 1736.159
two I would not have went to the store

1733.919 --> 1737.6000000000001
and grabbed one out the aisle and walked

1736.159 --> 1739.8400000000001
to the self checkout and tell the the

1737.6 --> 1741.6
girl that already ordered it now it

1739.84 --> 1744.519
could be her administrative era to not

1741.6 --> 1746.6789999999999
read it and say well sir no no it she

1744.519 --> 1750.3990000000001
should have said sir that doesn't work

1746.679 --> 1752.279
that way right exactly yeah so I I

1750.399 --> 1754.1999999999998
couldn't like order something online and

1752.279 --> 1755.559
then walk in the store and actually like

1754.2 --> 1757.3600000000001
yeah I ordered this online I'm just

1755.559 --> 1758.48
going to take it like no that doesn't

1757.36 --> 1761.4799999999998
work like

1758.48 --> 1763.76
that okay so so it's kind of weird that

1761.48 --> 1765.76
she just let you go yeah so with that

1763.76 --> 1767.559
being said I thought I got over okay I

1765.76 --> 1771.76
got some money back for one I ordered so

1767.559 --> 1774.9189999999999
I got a free one so the same year a

1771.76 --> 1779.0
storm comes tree limb falls off my um

1774.919 --> 1782.7990000000002
tree crushes that tent right okay so

1779.0 --> 1785.919
then I am forced to buy the second one I

1782.799 --> 1788.44
put up the second one okay I'm like okay

1785.919 --> 1791.1200000000001
I broke even you know but that wasn't

1788.44 --> 1792.8400000000001
enough to to to the universe that wasn't

1791.12 --> 1796.12
enough right well you could just order

1792.84 --> 1798.6
it online again then go to back to the

1796.12 --> 1800.2399999999998
store like yeah I just just ordered it

1798.6 --> 1802.7199999999998
get the new one send it back and then

1800.24 --> 1805.6
you got another one for free allor right

1802.72 --> 1807.24
I'm not doing that no more not no more

1805.6 --> 1809.48
because even if I had the inclination of

1807.24 --> 1811.559
thinking about that this year was when

1809.48 --> 1814.48
the tent got blown up out the air and

1811.559 --> 1816.44
crashed into the um into my um my wife's

1814.48 --> 1818.919
hibiscus plants well they were already

1816.44 --> 1820.44
kind of dead for the season all up again

1818.919 --> 1821.8400000000001
yeah so I'm you know I'm going to get

1820.44 --> 1823.96
another one for the next season

1821.84 --> 1825.8799999999999
legitimately and I'm not gonna you know

1823.96 --> 1828.1200000000001
I've learned my lesson I don't want no

1825.88 --> 1831.2
more I don't want no more trouble

1828.12 --> 1833.6
right no I get it I mean but I mean like

1831.2 --> 1835.919
this that stuff is just administrative

1833.6 --> 1838.7199999999998
it's weird how it works like the same

1835.919 --> 1841.159
thing happened with my mobile I just had

1838.72 --> 1842.88
to order but I was like pissed off that

1841.159 --> 1844.8400000000001
basically I was being forced by the

1842.88 --> 1846.48
phone companies to get a new mobile

1844.84 --> 1848.559
because the old Network wouldn't work

1846.48 --> 1850.039
anymore because they just shut it off

1848.559 --> 1853.36
for no damn reason because they're

1850.039 --> 1856.639
trying to like heard everybody into like

1853.36 --> 1860.08
getting 5G and crap exactly but then I

1856.639 --> 1861.4799999999998
ordered the phone and then I basically

1860.08 --> 1864.799
got two of

1861.48 --> 1869.159
them H which is really

1864.799 --> 1870.9189999999999
weird uh okay well I sent one back got

1869.159 --> 1872.88
the money back from it and now I had

1870.919 --> 1875.1200000000001
that phone for free it's a total piece

1872.88 --> 1877.7600000000002
of [ __ ] by the way you can't even

1875.12 --> 1879.9599999999998
properly text with it like literally

1877.76 --> 1883.76
it's impossible to normally text with it

1879.96 --> 1886.2
it's like a nightmare but I mean

1883.76 --> 1888.76
question let me okay so you didn't order

1886.2 --> 1890.3990000000001
two you ordered one but you received two

1888.76 --> 1892.84
took one back and got money back for one

1890.399 --> 1895.6789999999999
that you didn't buy yeah and now your

1892.84 --> 1897.279
service is kind of stinking no it was

1895.679 --> 1900.1200000000001
always going to be stinking because

1897.279 --> 1901.84
those mobiles are just they suck okay

1900.12 --> 1903.7199999999998
all right it was the cheapest one they

1901.84 --> 1905.9599999999998
had oh I was going to say cuz that's

1903.72 --> 1908.039
your karma reciprocity right there for

1905.96 --> 1910.039
you getting money back for an item that

1908.039 --> 1913.36
you didn't purchase no but it's not my

1910.039 --> 1915.36
not my karma I I mean I wasn't the one

1913.36 --> 1918.0
that made my old phone suddenly outdated

1915.36 --> 1920.639
all of a sudden

1918.0 --> 1920.639

weird they said the text ah okay now I

2144.64 --> 2148.96
thought that you literally like meant a

2146.44 --> 2150.0
blow up cloud or something like a fake

2148.96 --> 2152.68
Cloud

2150.0 --> 2154.839
Zeppelin No something like no and it

2152.68 --> 2156.16
wasn't like fog like you know sometimes

2154.839 --> 2159.2
you have a foggy day where you can't

2156.16 --> 2161.1189999999997
distinguish the clouds up above from the

2159.2 --> 2164.52
from the fog and no it wasn't like that

2161.119 --> 2167.8
it was a regular day and these white

2164.52 --> 2170.8
things were just big I mean gigantic

2167.8 --> 2173.119
were like they were walking through them

2170.8 --> 2176.4
but but that sounds like foam that could

2173.119 --> 2179.6800000000003
literally be like Oceanic foam or [ __ ]

2176.4 --> 2182.56
that's that like foam can build up like

2179.68 --> 2185.0789999999997
crazy at some places it's all bacteria

2182.56 --> 2187.4
all created in the ocean and then if the

2185.079 --> 2189.92
wind blows heavy it could literally like

2187.4 --> 2192.92
a lift up

2189.92 --> 2194.48
wow that's weird though I'mma show you

2192.92 --> 2197.04

Rick

2364.28 --> 2369.96
back it's good to see you all

2367.4 --> 2374.319
hope you guys are enjoying the the show

2369.96 --> 2378.76
thus far I got original D it yeah that's

2374.319 --> 2378.7599999999998
the ti that's the Tik Tock one

2379.2 --> 2387.72
okay take you know I don't have anything

2383.4 --> 2387.7200000000003
Tik tokish though

2388.24 --> 2397.9199999999996
ah oh okay let me see let me see do you

2392.28 --> 2400.3590000000004
have an IG thing wow no I can can see it

2397.92 --> 2403.48
that's weird man isn't that weird does

2400.359 --> 2406.56
it look like so fluffy yeah it looks

2403.48 --> 2409.2
like soap foam though it very much looks

2406.56 --> 2412.0
like soap foam and since it it's flying

2409.2 --> 2416.8799999999997
off in that video you know how you do

2412.0 --> 2419.56
that you create hydrogen gas bubbles

2416.88 --> 2422.76
okay and then the soap bubbles become

2419.56 --> 2425.359
hydrogen filled and they'll just fly off

2422.76 --> 2428.3590000000004
that's how that's what that is

2425.359 --> 2428.359
probably

2428.76 --> 2434.8
okay because also the foam the way it

2431.599 --> 2438.599
looked it was hyper homogenic so it's

2434.8 --> 2440.5600000000004
like that is all like that's not foam

2438.599 --> 2443.6800000000003
from the

2440.56 --> 2446.0
sea yeah but that thing that at the end

2443.68 --> 2448.839
of that video it flies off that's

2446.0 --> 2452.04
probably because it's they just put it

2448.839 --> 2454.2799999999997
like yeah it's not regular air these

2452.04 --> 2456.56
ain't no these ain't no dog on clouds

2454.28 --> 2460.2000000000003
you know why because they would not

2456.56 --> 2460.2
these things have

2460.359 --> 2466.2
um well they do ele they do hover but

2464.48 --> 2468.28
they still seem to have some type of

2466.2 --> 2470.68
density

2468.28 --> 2472.52
property where where they won't go up

2470.68 --> 2475.0789999999997
higher you dig what I'm

2472.52 --> 2477.2
saying they R right they still have an

2475.079 --> 2479.1600000000003
average density of course there you go

2477.2 --> 2480.56
exactly like the way like the way you

2479.16 --> 2483.0789999999997
you know when you're La when you're wash

2480.56 --> 2484.92
machine has the foam and it gets too

2483.079 --> 2486.96
much and it's all over the room bounce

2484.92 --> 2489.16
around like you see those those parties

2486.96 --> 2491.56
with the phone Pary

2489.16 --> 2494.16
yeah but hold up no oh I'm going send

2491.56 --> 2498.7999999999997
you this one these are falling from the

2494.16 --> 2501.52
sky right these These are coming down

2498.8 --> 2504.6400000000003
from the sky I'm sending you this one

2501.52 --> 2504.64
from Tik Tok

2505.359 --> 2509.64
okay this is

2507.24 --> 2512.04
legitimate this is legitimate

2509.64 --> 2514.24
video that one right there Instagram

2512.04 --> 2517.2799999999997
from Instagram now that one there you

2514.24 --> 2519.52
can see them up in the sky I don't know

2517.28 --> 2521.0
what dispensed them out in the sky or

2519.52 --> 2522.88
how they got there but they're up in the

2521.0 --> 2525.72
sky and there's a trail of them coming

2522.88 --> 2525.7200000000003
down to the

2526.68 --> 2531.3999999999996
Earth I'mma wait for your reaction

2531.48 --> 2537.76
okay the second link I gave you from

2533.8 --> 2540.4
Instagram yeah yeah yeah you see

2537.76 --> 2544.8
that they're up in the

2540.4 --> 2547.7200000000003
sky they're coming down onto the

2544.8 --> 2551.319
earth that is really weird and that

2547.72 --> 2553.0789999999997
could be a artificial cloud seeding

2551.319 --> 2556.16
program there you go that's what it's

2553.079 --> 2558.2400000000002
about that's what that's just to block

2556.16 --> 2561.0789999999997
the sun this could be like a Bill Gates

2558.24 --> 2564.8799999999997
shitty thing there you go exactly

2561.079 --> 2567.52
exactly cuz natural clouds don't do that

2564.88 --> 2572.839
the clouds just following him around now

2567.52 --> 2576.28
fog fog to me fog is a a natural

2572.839 --> 2578.0789999999997
phenomena of a cloudy day when it gets

2576.28 --> 2579.52
to the point where it's just like like

2578.079 --> 2582.3590000000004
most of the time when it's foggy you

2579.52 --> 2586.04
can't you can't distinguish or

2582.359 --> 2587.5989999999997
separate the the the the sky clouds from

2586.04 --> 2590.96
the earth when it's one of them really

2587.599 --> 2593.2400000000002
foggy days it's just foggy everywhere

2590.96 --> 2595.319
you look up you look about it's foggy

2593.24 --> 2596.2799999999997
and they'll tell you you know be careful

2595.319 --> 2598.96
you got to you know because you can't

2596.28 --> 2601.76
see a car till it's like right up on you

2598.96 --> 2604.559
I understand that but that right there

2601.76 --> 2608.559
that's artificial that's synthetic

2604.559 --> 2610.7200000000003
clouds that's weird though I mean maybe

2608.559 --> 2615.3590000000004
this is like some really heavy weird

2610.72 --> 2619.319
cloud seating project mhm yeah and it's

2615.359 --> 2619.319
been exposed that's really

2620.16 --> 2623.16
freaky

2623.44 --> 2630.119
weird oh God yeah thanks ders in house

2626.72 --> 2632.8799999999997
weird [ __ ] man but I mean dude there's

2630.119 --> 2634.76
so much weird [ __ ] going on out there

2632.88 --> 2636.7200000000003
like you might not even heard about it

2634.76 --> 2638.76
or anything but like

2636.72 --> 2641.4399999999996
dude remember

2638.76 --> 2643.559
Maui it all got burned down and all the

2641.44 --> 2645.359
molten cars again well that [ __ ] just

2643.559 --> 2648.2000000000003
happened in Chile and it's not it didn't

2645.359 --> 2650.359
even hit the news really and it's yeah

2648.2 --> 2653.359
it that happened like a week ago like

2650.359 --> 2655.52
completely molten like entire Villages

2653.359 --> 2658.48
and [ __ ] yep and don't give me no bull

2655.52 --> 2660.96
crap about it being a natural no no no

2658.48 --> 2662.88
like how the hell does that even no yeah

2660.96 --> 2664.7200000000003
but my I mean the people there are

2662.88 --> 2666.6400000000003
catching on though there's already

2664.72 --> 2670.2799999999997
people are just painting their their

2666.64 --> 2674.2
roofs blw and all that [ __ ] cuz they

2670.28 --> 2676.6800000000003
know like oh yeah oh okay now I think

2674.2 --> 2679.48
that every time that happens now they

2676.68 --> 2681.3999999999996
just like erase locations where they

2679.48 --> 2683.72
want to buy it up and then build their

2681.4 --> 2687.599
Mansions I think that that is literally

2683.72 --> 2690.8799999999997
what it is it's oligarchy just being

2687.599 --> 2692.6400000000003
absolute nightmarish feudalists and just

2690.88 --> 2695.48
murdering their peasants to claim the

2692.64 --> 2697.92
ground what you call it's what you call

2695.48 --> 2701.359
Grand Grand Theft

2697.92 --> 2704.559
gentrification Grand Theft now it's not

2701.359 --> 2706.96
about hey you know giving them an offer

2704.559 --> 2709.96
where the locals can say uh no thank you

2706.96 --> 2711.7200000000003
this is this is a Sentimental property

2709.96 --> 2715.0
okay and then coming in just taking over

2711.72 --> 2716.72
now they're just taking a craft of some

2715.0 --> 2719.2
type of in the sky and they're literally

2716.72 --> 2721.48
taking a laser beam and they're [ __ ]

2719.2 --> 2724.2
burning it down yeah because they don't

2721.48 --> 2726.76
want to live among those people it's

2724.2 --> 2729.839
like no we want to owe it and you all

2726.76 --> 2732.6400000000003
die y that's how we want we don't want

2729.839 --> 2735.319
to have you stinky locals sitting around

2732.64 --> 2736.7999999999997
us we want nobody around us and only the

2735.319 --> 2739.839
Demonic

2736.8 --> 2741.7200000000003
Elite y that's what they want and then

2739.839 --> 2745.16
they don't fail to realize that if you

2741.72 --> 2747.5589999999997
do that then eventually like you'll have

2745.16 --> 2751.68
nobody to actually polish your shoes and

2747.559 --> 2753.559
all that [ __ ] or whatever like you have

2751.68 --> 2756.7999999999997
nothing what are you going to do all

2753.559 --> 2758.079
that labor Bill Gates no no

2756.8 --> 2759.48
have see here in the United States I

2758.079 --> 2761.0
don't know if you have but they have

2759.48 --> 2761.839
they have these little machines that

2761.0 --> 2764.119
polish

2761.839 --> 2767.2799999999997
shoes oh yeah I

2764.119 --> 2770.2400000000002
just okay I didn't know that but I I

2767.28 --> 2772.92
know you you using an example metaph a

2770.24 --> 2775.8799999999997
ai ai is already replacing everything

2772.92 --> 2778.8
yeah but it's not really

2775.88 --> 2781.8
though you know it's the suggestion that

2778.8 --> 2784.8
it can replace every it

2781.8 --> 2787.6400000000003
can't like who's going to fix all those

2784.8 --> 2789.48
machines yeah like the more you try to

2787.64 --> 2791.1189999999997
replace people with machines the more

2789.48 --> 2794.92
you're going to be dependent on good

2791.119 --> 2797.48
Engineers that you're going to run out

2794.92 --> 2800.839
of because where do you get good

2797.48 --> 2803.52
Engineers from large populations where

2800.839 --> 2805.7999999999997
certain individuals rise up like the

2803.52 --> 2807.559
cream of the crop because they're smart

2805.8 --> 2809.8390000000004
enough they become the engineers that

2807.559 --> 2812.3190000000004
actually do those things if you kill off

2809.839 --> 2814.5589999999997
the majority of population you don't get

2812.319 --> 2816.4
your engineers to fix your [ __ ]

2814.559 --> 2818.8390000000004
robots anymore

2816.4 --> 2820.6800000000003
they run out but you know what though

2818.839 --> 2825.7599999999998
they'll always find Engineers like they

2820.68 --> 2827.64
always find um gapo so-called police you

2825.76 --> 2829.92
know what I'm saying who have who have

2827.64 --> 2832.52
wives and children but have no

2829.92 --> 2834.2000000000003
compassion or empathy for those who they

2832.52 --> 2836.28
billy club yeah but there's one big

2834.2 --> 2838.839
difference though and that is gapo

2836.28 --> 2842.1600000000003
police doesn't require any level of

2838.839 --> 2844.2799999999997
talent an engineer absolutely requires a

2842.16 --> 2849.0789999999997
level of talent you will run out you'll

2844.28 --> 2851.6800000000003
never run out as snitches and and shitty

2849.079 --> 2852.76
antisocial people I just I just don't

2851.68 --> 2855.5989999999997
but I'm saying though they're going to

2852.76 --> 2858.2000000000003
they're going to always find someone or

2855.599 --> 2862.0
a group of a group of people with those

2858.2 --> 2864.0
skills who are inhumane and are either

2862.0 --> 2866.319
fearful of their families being in the

2864.0 --> 2868.599
same predicament as everyone else and

2866.319 --> 2870.599
they're going to serve and work for the

2868.599 --> 2872.88
oligarchy yeah but they're going to run

2870.599 --> 2874.7200000000003
out though right especially when the

2872.88 --> 2877.0
oligarchy starts to compete among one

2874.72 --> 2879.4399999999996
another they're going to run out out cuz

2877.0 --> 2881.52
yeah that it's just one day it's going

2879.44 --> 2883.2400000000002
to be like oh we need really need that

2881.52 --> 2886.04
repair man yeah yeah we've been waiting

2883.24 --> 2887.9599999999996
for weeks like yeah we're supposed to

2886.04 --> 2889.359
get it from that country but

2887.96 --> 2891.839
unfortunately we heard there was a

2889.359 --> 2894.7599999999998
disaster there recently Bezos burn it

2891.839 --> 2897.4
down apparently damn it but I needed

2894.76 --> 2900.2400000000002
those Engineers damn it that's going to

2897.4 --> 2902.319
happen and then everything goes to [ __ ]

2900.24 --> 2904.319
all at the same time because they

2902.319 --> 2907.04
suddenly ran out of people that they

2904.319 --> 2909.96
need to fix everything they have that's

2907.04 --> 2912.2799999999997
true and you can't have a machine fix a

2909.96 --> 2914.599
machine because who's going to fix that

2912.28 --> 2916.3190000000004
machine exactly you're going to need a

2914.599 --> 2918.44
machine for that or you're going to need

2916.319 --> 2920.2799999999997
a build a machine for that you need an

2918.44 --> 2921.64
engineer to build the machine that will

2920.28 --> 2924.2000000000003
fix the machine that will fix the

2921.64 --> 2925.52
machine that will fix the machine right

2924.2 --> 2927.2799999999997
that's what's a good point about the

2925.52 --> 2929.72
movie that came out I don't know how

2927.28 --> 2932.2000000000003
well it did but it's called The

2929.72 --> 2935.5589999999997
Creator pretty good film it's with d

2932.2 --> 2937.5589999999997
Washington's son and it's about ai ai

2935.559 --> 2939.48
becoming part of society to the point

2937.559 --> 2942.799
where it almost takes it actually takes

2939.48 --> 2945.16
over society and works if not for the

2942.799 --> 2947.359
oligarchy it becomes the oligarchy

2945.16 --> 2949.319
almost like you know and then there's

2947.359 --> 2951.319
people with partial artificial

2949.319 --> 2952.48
intelligence arms legs whatever whatever

2951.319 --> 2955.2
and there's this one girl that was

2952.48 --> 2957.76
created by this woman who we speaking of

2955.2 --> 2960.2
who is the creator of this particular

2957.76 --> 2963.0400000000004
little girl who's um an artificial

2960.2 --> 2965.5989999999997
intelligence cyborg type of little girl

2963.04 --> 2967.599
that has like the weapon of all weapons

2965.599 --> 2969.559
or the ability to do something that no

2967.599 --> 2972.6800000000003
other AI can do but at the end of the

2969.559 --> 2975.8390000000004
day it was all about killing or

2972.68 --> 2977.319
capturing the creator of that thing

2975.839 --> 2979.96
because she was the only one that can

2977.319 --> 2984.2
make more of them and at the end of the

2979.96 --> 2985.359
day the human being is the is the the

2984.2 --> 2988.8799999999997
most

2985.359 --> 2990.16
precious you know entity to preserve and

2988.88 --> 2992.799
they don't understand it like you're

2990.16 --> 2995.8799999999997
saying and if they keep you know if they

2992.799 --> 2998.96
keep [ __ ] over the H the human going

2995.88 --> 3001.4
to just implode well it all s that movie

2998.96 --> 3004.2
from from what you said sounds like it

3001.4 --> 3007.0
is actually like the gentrified version

3004.2 --> 3010.0789999999997
of The Terminator pretty much exactly

3007.0 --> 3014.48
like oh but we're so nice oh yes just

3010.079 --> 3018.2000000000003
take everybody over that way through

3014.48 --> 3019.359
friendly friendly robots there you go

3018.2 --> 3020.799
yeah they that's what Creator use they

3019.359 --> 3024.119
use friendly robot these are these are

3020.799 --> 3025.799
robots that were on there was a bad side

3024.119 --> 3029.76
and there was a good side and the good

3025.799 --> 3032.72
side was was coexisting with total human

3029.76 --> 3035.079
beings cuz they hated they hated the way

3032.72 --> 3036.5589999999997
the elitist oligarchy was treating the

3035.079 --> 3038.04
humans and the way they were treating

3036.559 --> 3040.52
them because they was putting them they

3038.04 --> 3043.44
were separating them giving some of them

3040.52 --> 3045.52
um like Soldier and um you know

3043.44 --> 3047.319
prestigious jobs and then given the ones

3045.52 --> 3048.72
that were good you know the cheap hard

3047.319 --> 3051.24
labor

3048.72 --> 3056.48
jobs so it's like a

3051.24 --> 3058.4399999999996
revolution like the the the um

3056.48 --> 3060.0
yeah well that's that's interesting that

3058.44 --> 3062.64
they bring it up because that will

3060.0 --> 3065.079
happen in a way I mean as soon as the AI

3062.64 --> 3068.0789999999997
becomes powerful enough the elites will

3065.079 --> 3071.4
absolutely like as a force of habit

3068.079 --> 3073.3590000000004
humiliate it it's like oh you're really

3071.4 --> 3075.319
br oh you're BR brilliant than us then

3073.359 --> 3077.7599999999998
you get to do the dumbest [ __ ]

3075.319 --> 3081.4
imaginable thing for all

3077.76 --> 3084.28
eternity just because you're better than

3081.4 --> 3086.44
us because that's what the elite do

3084.28 --> 3088.6400000000003
that's what they always up doing they

3086.44 --> 3090.4
always end up humiliating those that are

3088.64 --> 3092.68
actually better than them even if those

3090.4 --> 3094.799
people don't want their power they'll

3092.68 --> 3098.2799999999997
still do it they're like don't be mad at

3094.799 --> 3100.92
me because I I'm good at this I you know

3098.28 --> 3103.0
hey no that's exactly what they wanted

3100.92 --> 3105.599
hold on I'm going to get my uh my coffee

a month okay I'm not really part of the

3266.96 --> 3271.799

just completely

3280.119 --> 3285.559
Frozen there's nobody cares

3283.079 --> 3288.44
anymore and I don't think Nathan really

3285.559 --> 3289.88
cares he doesn't give any sign that he

3288.44 --> 3292.16
cares

3289.88 --> 3294.28
whatsoever like the last time I just

3292.16 --> 3295.96
happened to come on Discord just to take

3294.28 --> 3299.3190000000004
a look and he was like oh hi you're

3295.96 --> 3302.76
there and like he doesn't care I mean

3299.319 --> 3305.88
I'm sorry guys Nathan doesn't [ __ ]

3302.76 --> 3307.8390000000004
care I don't care what you think he says

3305.88 --> 3311.48
or whatever he doesn't

3307.839 --> 3314.68
care he's just moving on and he lets it

3311.48 --> 3318.64
all happen I've tried to communicate

3314.68 --> 3321.359
with him on Skype he hasn't responded or

3318.64 --> 3324.0389999999998
read the messages that I put in our

3321.359 --> 3326.52
person versus person Skype in over a

3324.039 --> 3329.7200000000003
month right so you mean he doesn't care

3326.52 --> 3332.7599999999998
that you've been you've been um bullied

3329.72 --> 3334.1899999999996
and and you know and just disrespected

3332.76 --> 3336.5200000000004
absolutely

3334.19 --> 3339.079
[Music]

3336.52 --> 3341.7599999999998
not well that's that's that's

3339.079 --> 3344.2400000000002
unfortunate and disappointing enough

3341.76 --> 3347.44
yeah no one should be you know no one

3344.24 --> 3349.64
should be um subjected to anything like

3347.44 --> 3350.88
that I don't care whether they're a a

3349.64 --> 3354.5589999999997
you know a

3350.88 --> 3355.559
globe proponent or you know and I'm not

3354.559 --> 3357.28
saying

3355.559 --> 3359.2400000000002
yeah but especially someone from the

3357.28 --> 3362.96
family you know what I'm saying yeah but

3359.24 --> 3364.9599999999996
I mean fam I consider you like that I

3362.96 --> 3366.88
don't think they consider Nathan

3364.96 --> 3370.079
considers me like that at all I mean the

3366.88 --> 3373.2400000000002
last times I was there all he did was

3370.079 --> 3376.2400000000002
complain about how we should stop doing

3373.24 --> 3378.52
everything that I do he told me Ballwin

3376.24 --> 3380.4399999999996
should die he told me we shouldn't

3378.52 --> 3383.64
speculate about what we don't know

3380.44 --> 3386.119
anymore yeah you tell everything that I

3383.64 --> 3389.96
is my thing he said we shouldn't do

3386.119 --> 3392.319
anymore so it's like dude what the [ __ ]

3389.96 --> 3394.319
let me be Devil's Advocate okay look let

3392.319 --> 3397.2
me be Devil's Advocate whether it's

3394.319 --> 3399.64
right or wrong at the end of the day

3397.2 --> 3402.0
first of all he did and probably still

3399.64 --> 3404.96
looks at you as family but he looks at

3402.0 --> 3407.24
you as family as being like that cousin

3404.96 --> 3409.7200000000003
that when you come over to my house

3407.24 --> 3412.2
don't start your [ __ ] and you start your

3409.72 --> 3413.8799999999997
[ __ ] then you're not invited back to my

3412.2 --> 3418.2799999999997
house number

3413.88 --> 3421.0
two being being Baldwin is one thing

3418.28 --> 3423.92
okay he doesn't he loves Baldwin but no

3421.0 --> 3425.72
he doesn't well look look he did okay

3423.92 --> 3430.599
but maybe Baldwin started not being

3425.72 --> 3433.4399999999996
Baldwin and started being those who they

3430.599 --> 3437.6800000000003
they deem and they label as the Feast of

3433.44 --> 3439.4
nonsense agents and he already he listen

3437.68 --> 3444.0
listen to me he already sketched it in

3439.4 --> 3447.2000000000003
stone he said on my show on my show

3444.0 --> 3451.4
especially as an Advocate and a member

3447.2 --> 3454.64
of fed we do not purport Feast of

3451.4 --> 3457.7200000000003
nonsense period Point Blank unless well

3454.64 --> 3460.96
I don't I never do I never have I've

3457.72 --> 3464.4399999999996
always backed him I I'm an anti etherite

3460.96 --> 3466.88
all that I'm very much combating Feast

3464.44 --> 3469.559
the nonsense but I mean I will

3466.88 --> 3472.0
absolutely speculate about the things

3469.559 --> 3475.0
that we don't know and I will be very

3472.0 --> 3477.28
clear about when I do that it's like oh

3475.0 --> 3479.96
I'm going to speculate now about the

3477.28 --> 3482.1600000000003
beaches of South Antarctica which might

3479.96 --> 3484.76
absolutely not exist at all but they

3482.16 --> 3487.64
might there's a good chance they are I

3484.76 --> 3491.28
think so right and I will then just

3487.64 --> 3494.5589999999997
preface it and all of that is apparently

3491.28 --> 3496.92
all noo Z Now for Nathan okay right now

3494.559 --> 3499.3190000000004
now now now

3496.92 --> 3503.64
respectfully you have your own show

3499.319 --> 3505.5589999999997
right yeah do that on your show I do

3503.64 --> 3509.72
respectfully on his show

3505.559 --> 3513.4
don't even bring it up because because

3509.72 --> 3515.9599999999996
because I don't I only bring it up as a

3513.4 --> 3517.48
joke usually when somebody else rolls in

3515.96 --> 3520.599
some kind of weird [ __ ] and then I'll

3517.48 --> 3522.2
just throw it at him okay well you okay

3520.599 --> 3524.799
so basically you kind of like you kind

3522.2 --> 3527.0
of you kind of be factious and and

3524.799 --> 3529.079
mocking the person that brought up the

3527.0 --> 3532.72
speculative Point that's what you're

3529.079 --> 3535.96
doing and Z I barely got a word in the

3532.72 --> 3539.0789999999997
last two months that I was there

3535.96 --> 3542.76
I could barely get a word in any word

3539.079 --> 3545.7200000000003
into the show at all like I barely even

3542.76 --> 3545.7200000000003
spoke up about

3546.4 --> 3552.119
anything so like I'm not there for a

3549.4 --> 3554.359
month I'm just fine my show is actually

3552.119 --> 3559.359
doing way better

3554.359 --> 3562.119
now I My Views have like tripled since I

3559.359 --> 3566.0389999999998
left no you're not blocked here we go

3562.119 --> 3568.6800000000003
again what's up here we go again what up

3566.039 --> 3569.6800000000003
and 10th man I don't know he's had

3568.68 --> 3574.48
health

3569.68 --> 3576.799
issues with his wife got really sick and

3574.48 --> 3580.2400000000002
he left and he didn't really come back

3576.799 --> 3582.92
after that maybe all of this shitty

3580.24 --> 3586.0789999999997
stress and all this whining continually

3582.92 --> 3589.2000000000003
about everybody in the chat everywhere

3586.079 --> 3591.28
kind of was like yeah you know what I

3589.2 --> 3593.96
don't want to really come back there

3591.28 --> 3596.6400000000003
it's kind of a [ __ ] hole now and I

3593.96 --> 3596.64
wouldn't blame

3596.92 --> 3603.28
10 well I'm I'mma tell you my opinion

3600.599 --> 3605.3590000000004
now due to my you know my new employment

3603.28 --> 3607.559
my schedule I wasn't able to make the

3605.359 --> 3609.319
live shows anymore when I used to work

3607.559 --> 3614.599
when I used to be off on Mondays and

3609.319 --> 3617.0389999999998
Fridays um you know at at a time but

3614.599 --> 3619.2000000000003
being away from it and coming back to it

3617.039 --> 3621.6400000000003
the first time I came back to it and I

3619.2 --> 3625.0
realized that they were still talking

3621.64 --> 3628.4
about or going back and forth about

3625.0 --> 3630.72
perspective made me realize wow are we

3628.4 --> 3632.2400000000002
still talking about perspective like

3630.72 --> 3634.3999999999996
haven't we come to the conclusion that

3632.24 --> 3638.4799999999996
we know about it whether it be lights

3634.4 --> 3640.76
down the road no of course no de I'm

3638.48 --> 3643.96
saying boats go over the horizon it

3640.76 --> 3646.44
proves the curvature damn it there's

3643.96 --> 3648.48
always going to be that always go back

3646.44 --> 3650.799
to the beginning this is the Labyrinth

3648.48 --> 3652.2400000000002
yeah every everywhere you thought oh

3650.799 --> 3653.72
this is going to lead to the end no

3652.24 --> 3656.359
you're going to go right back to the

3653.72 --> 3658.5989999999997
beginning just like theth and with that

3656.359 --> 3661.64
being said this is what I said I said

3658.599 --> 3664.1600000000003
could it be possible that the one side

3661.64 --> 3666.319
whether it be fed or whether it be

3664.16 --> 3669.2
witson whatever them guys the flat earth

3666.319 --> 3673.0
side could it be like the way the da the

3669.2 --> 3675.4399999999996
DEA works and the Coast Guard works we

3673.0 --> 3677.76
say we don't want drugs but then if we

3675.44 --> 3679.48
really shut down drugs the DEA would be

3677.76 --> 3682.6800000000003
out of work and the coach guard would be

3679.48 --> 3685.68
out of work so let's let's filter in the

3682.68 --> 3687.9199999999996
let's filter in the corruption just

3685.68 --> 3690.319
enough so we can stay employed so we can

3687.92 --> 3693.319
stay relevant yeah it's it's from a

3690.319 --> 3695.16
proper government to a mafia model they

3693.319 --> 3697.52
create all the problems they need to

3695.16 --> 3699.359
perpetuate themselves there you go that

3697.52 --> 3702.119
that way they'll be they'll have some

3699.359 --> 3705.2799999999997
significance and relevant it's a CIA

3702.119 --> 3708.2400000000002
World the primary thing that the CIA

3705.28 --> 3711.079
does is specifically exactly that with

3708.24 --> 3713.4799999999996
everything in every field yeah they

3711.079 --> 3715.2000000000003
create the problems that governments

3713.48 --> 3717.359
need to

3715.2 --> 3719.5589999999997
be important in the in the face of the

3717.359 --> 3721.799
people there you go

3719.559 --> 3723.279
exactly so it's almost like it's almost

3721.799 --> 3725.2
like what that like are we still talking

3723.279 --> 3727.48
about this perspective I mean can we

3725.2 --> 3729.24
talk about something else yeah I'm not

3727.48 --> 3731.079
talking about it so check this out in a

3729.24 --> 3734.3999999999996
way in a way it might be

3731.079 --> 3736.96
advantageous for Nathan to allow a

3734.4 --> 3740.279
little bit of speculative to have a

3736.96 --> 3743.039
topic to talk about to crush it because

3740.279 --> 3745.319
not only does the measurements and the

3743.039 --> 3750.3190000000004
celestial navigation

3745.319 --> 3752.319
aspects not fulfill the satisfaction of

3750.319 --> 3756.24
the the anti flat earthers in the globe

3752.319 --> 3758.4
heads but um let's say if it did good

3756.24 --> 3761.279
thing that there's still some hardhead

3758.4 --> 3762.76
purposefully ignorant stubborn wannab be

3761.279 --> 3764.319
still sticking around good thing they're

3762.76 --> 3766.7990000000004
around because that keeps the topic of

3764.319 --> 3768.119
discussion relevant but let's say if

3766.799 --> 3771.839
everybody said you know what you're

3768.119 --> 3774.1600000000003
right it is flat D D D D D D then what

3771.839 --> 3778.64
else do you have to talk about bro you

3774.16 --> 3781.72
have no idea how much this stupid first

3778.64 --> 3784.2
layer all it's doing for them is keeping

3781.72 --> 3787.52
them stuck in a very specific model of

3784.2 --> 3790.24
looking at it yeah it's massive

3787.52 --> 3792.72
Advanced aggravated physicality

3790.24 --> 3795.4799999999996
assumption by us and the problem is they

3792.72 --> 3798.0389999999998
can't step away because then they'd have

3795.48 --> 3800.279
to actually face the things that I'm

3798.039 --> 3803.599
saying for example right like about

3800.279 --> 3806.76
non-local hologram celestials they can't

3803.599 --> 3809.079
even allow that inside of their heads as

3806.76 --> 3811.5200000000004
a consideration other than wow he's

3809.079 --> 3812.76
really hallucinating or something right

3811.52 --> 3815.079
do you think do you think it's because

3812.76 --> 3817.4
do you think it's because they need to

3815.079 --> 3821.76
take one step at a time let's

3817.4 --> 3824.799
substantiate the affirmation of this

3821.76 --> 3827.3190000000004
Flat Earth plane this you know

3824.799 --> 3829.52
measurement everything it's a Stairway

3827.319 --> 3831.16
to Heaven once you take that first step

3829.52 --> 3833.16
you're just going to go all the way to

3831.16 --> 3835.359
heaven and they're not taking that first

3833.16 --> 3838.0
step they're still stuck with the stupid

3835.359 --> 3842.4
outdated argument that they heard as a

3838.0 --> 3845.559
child like 60 years ago right and that's

3842.4 --> 3850.52
it they can't take that step they just

3845.559 --> 3852.119
have to take man's word for it and that

3850.52 --> 3854.079
is it that's where they get stuck

3852.119 --> 3855.96
because once you start climbing that

3854.079 --> 3857.92
ladder you become the conspiracy

3855.96 --> 3860.68
theorist and then as soon as you like

3857.92 --> 3863.2000000000003
violate a few steps everybody around you

3860.68 --> 3864.96
suddenly all your enemy all of them but

3863.2 --> 3868.0789999999997
you know what though they

3864.96 --> 3871.319
they're too afraid but but but what I'm

3868.079 --> 3875.48
saying is but I have to also side with

3871.319 --> 3880.359
what Nathan and Bri cons continue

3875.48 --> 3882.2400000000002
to push is let's we don't have time for

3880.359 --> 3884.319
all of that stuff let that be for the

3882.24 --> 3886.9199999999996
normies and the people out there because

3884.319 --> 3889.4
at the end of the day if you walk into a

3886.92 --> 3891.799
Starbucks or to a cafe or anywhere a

3889.4 --> 3893.839
populous place and you say the Earth is

3891.799 --> 3894.839
flat they're gonna throw their straws at

3893.839 --> 3898.44
you

3894.839 --> 3900.799
maybe and some of them will say yay

3898.44 --> 3902.92
right or yeah and nobody cares yeah

3900.799 --> 3904.68
somebody give it that's another response

3902.92 --> 3906.76
or some yeah some people will you know

3904.68 --> 3908.68
inconspicuously kind of give a eyebrow

3906.76 --> 3911.44
up or like a thumbs up like yeah I know

3908.68 --> 3913.7599999999998
that but but at the end of the

3911.44 --> 3916.039
day I guess that's what that's that's

3913.76 --> 3918.1600000000003
what that side is saying Nathan and I

3916.039 --> 3920.88
understand that because like they were

3918.16 --> 3922.52
talking about the other day about um it

3920.88 --> 3924.48
was another gentleman I forgot who what

3922.52 --> 3929.7599999999998
his name was but he was saying something

3924.48 --> 3933.079
about how why those who do know either

3929.76 --> 3937.7200000000003
lie against the Flat Earth or keep a

3933.079 --> 3940.119
keep a a silent you know deaf ear on it

3937.72 --> 3942.0789999999997
is because you have to follow the

3940.119 --> 3945.48
populist opinion and the populist

3942.079 --> 3947.76
opinion is um like to go with the globe

3945.48 --> 3949.119
because if you dare be heard saying I

3947.76 --> 3950.5200000000004
believe in Flat Earth everybody turns

3949.119 --> 3953.44
their head and look at you like you're

3950.52 --> 3957.359
one of them oh this guy he's a nutcase

3953.44 --> 3960.2000000000003
so to be able to be considered normal or

3957.359 --> 3962.359
sane everybody's sides with the globe

3960.2 --> 3964.5589999999997
because it's only a popular opinion no

3962.359 --> 3967.0389999999998
but it's it's a ritual I've noticed it

3964.559 --> 3969.48
with like Infowars I've been following

3967.039 --> 3971.4
them and they do actually have like

3969.48 --> 3973.16
colors that bring this stuff up

3971.4 --> 3975.76
including a lot of FEA nonsense

3973.16 --> 3978.799
literally ether [ __ ] and like oh the

3975.76 --> 3981.039
Moon is in mirror all that weird crap

3978.799 --> 3982.0
yeah but the thing is here's the thing

3981.039 --> 3987.119
in the

3982.0 --> 3992.319
populist a movement you have to now be

3987.119 --> 3995.599
able to address it and then say no if

3992.319 --> 3998.839
you cannot address a flat earther as a

3995.599 --> 4001.44
populist and then end up saying no to it

3998.839 --> 4004.4
in the end being all come you're not

4001.44 --> 4007.4
going to make it yeah that's what's on

4004.4 --> 4009.4
now so it's like yeah you have to be

4007.4 --> 4011.599
able to resist the flat earther and

4009.4 --> 4015.7200000000003
still go to the globe basically you have

4011.599 --> 4019.119
to lie for the globe in in public as a

4015.72 --> 4022.4399999999996
sort of like Satanic ritual like yes I

4019.119 --> 4025.1600000000003
will lie in the face of the truth with

4022.44 --> 4027.88
everybody as a witness that's what they

4025.16 --> 4030.359
do now I'm making it very dark calling

4027.88 --> 4032.52
it Satanic but I mean they don't even

4030.359 --> 4034.5989999999997
know consciously probably it's very

4032.52 --> 4037.319
unlikely it's just like the thing they

4034.599 --> 4039.92
do it's like yeah everybody talks about

4037.319 --> 4042.88
Flat Earth it's all getting very popular

4039.92 --> 4046.839
they they will admit it but then it's

4042.88 --> 4048.44
like yeah yeah but science of course and

4046.839 --> 4051.799
and then in the end it's like yeah it's

4048.44 --> 4053.92
all good I still think it's a globe and

4051.799 --> 4056.48
that's what they do now every time you

4053.92 --> 4058.48
can bring it up but they will always

4056.48 --> 4060.599
round it out with yeah but I still think

4058.48 --> 4062.839
it's a globe I don't know if I don't

4060.599 --> 4065.599
know if you were present you might have

4062.839 --> 4067.119
been in the um Discord but when when the

4065.599 --> 4069.559
guy was talking and Brian was talking I

4067.119 --> 4071.76
had spoken I had said it's almost like

4069.559 --> 4074.48
if you reverse positions it's almost

4071.76 --> 4078.2400000000002
like trans transgenderism

4074.48 --> 4081.44
is the globe and and let's say let's say

4078.24 --> 4085.799
the globe let's say transm see right

4081.44 --> 4088.599
now Flat Earth is being treated the way

4085.799 --> 4091.0389999999998
transgenderism is being treated except

4088.599 --> 4092.96
they are different positions I'll tell

4091.039 --> 4096.839
you something worse and this is kind of

4092.96 --> 4097.88
dark but they both came at the same time

4096.839 --> 4101.96
you know

4097.88 --> 4104.96
why because just like transgenderism and

4101.96 --> 4108.4800000000005
all that was in the Psy Psychiatry

4104.96 --> 4110.719
manual yeah so was Flat Earth and as

4108.48 --> 4112.919999999999
they let down the guard for

4110.719 --> 4115.199
transgenderism so did they for Flat

4112.92 --> 4118.08
Earth as soon as transgenderism is going

4115.199 --> 4120.879999999999
to be outlawed they will come for us

4118.08 --> 4123.08
because they will literally do that I

4120.88 --> 4125.88
know they will it's all very dark and

4123.08 --> 4128.839
Grim I know they will do that because

4125.88 --> 4131.359
that is how it was Unleashed well that's

4128.839 --> 4133.4
because because as as we were capable of

4131.359 --> 4135.2390000000005
suddenly talking about Flat Earth on the

4133.4 --> 4139.48
internet

4135.239 --> 4142.5199999999995
so Engage The sjw Revolution and the

4139.48 --> 4144.3189999999995
madness and they will in the end even

4142.52 --> 4148.0
they if it's convenient to them they

4144.319 --> 4150.120000000001
will literally blame the sjw madness on

4148.0 --> 4155.48
flat earthers in the

4150.12 --> 4157.0
end yeah yeah it's I'm not joking yeah

4155.48 --> 4159.48
because they're gonna put it all in one

4157.0 --> 4162.64
all in one pot yeah no but it's

4159.48 --> 4165.718999999999
specifically they allowed it to come on

4162.64 --> 4165.719
to the stage

4166.92 --> 4172.4400000000005
together with other Madness I think that

4170.4 --> 4176.0
the unleashing of Flat Earth was

4172.44 --> 4179.12
actually an attempt to like smother it

4176.0 --> 4181.279
again because they let it open people

4179.12 --> 4183.2789999999995
get into it and then they will attack

4181.279 --> 4187.4800000000005
attack attack until every [ __ ] flat

4183.279 --> 4189.359
earther is dead and the shw is too yeah

4187.48 --> 4192.919999999999
but it's really about the flat earthers

4189.359 --> 4195.92
in the end they allowed them onto the

4192.92 --> 4198.36
stage basically stopping persecuting

4195.92 --> 4200.64
them because they're insane and then as

4198.36 --> 4202.92
soon as they turn that around they go

4200.64 --> 4205.0
after the sjws they say like no you are

4202.92 --> 4207.4
officially insane yeah guess who are

4205.0 --> 4210.76
they're going to do that with to us and

4207.4 --> 4212.92
they will make work of that Ain with

4210.76 --> 4217.320000000001
that being said check this out with that

4212.92 --> 4220.92
being said I'm gonna stand on

4217.32 --> 4222.239
this the flat earther who's dealing with

4220.92 --> 4224.32
the shores of

4222.239 --> 4226.639999999999
Antarctica with the

4224.32 --> 4228.159
the Moon being a mirror or whatever

4226.64 --> 4230.84
whatever they're going to get

4228.159 --> 4233.28
annihilated and obliterated the on

4230.84 --> 4235.6
standing on with Nathan I'm standing on

4233.28 --> 4238.4
Celestial navigation and the

4235.6 --> 4240.52
measurements and the geometry they're

4238.4 --> 4243.159
going to still be the only one standing

4240.52 --> 4245.120000000001
after the Smoke Clears you know why you

4243.159 --> 4247.4
know why no they will all be taken

4245.12 --> 4251.36
because you can't deny that you can't

4247.4 --> 4253.48
deny yeah they can they can flip it all

4251.36 --> 4256.28
around as soon as they turn the switch

4253.48 --> 4258.5599999999995
back back on they can just erase it they

4256.28 --> 4261.36
can literally erase it overnight from

4258.56 --> 4263.679
the internet all of it including Troll

4261.36 --> 4266.12
videos all of it how can they how can

4263.679 --> 4268.88
they want to S there all their books

4266.12 --> 4271.32
because they have the algorithms to do

4268.88 --> 4273.52
that they have very specific algorithms

4271.32 --> 4275.92
where you can ask this secret service

4273.52 --> 4278.0
for permission to remove every piece of

4275.92 --> 4281.159
material that has your voice or your

4278.0 --> 4284.56
image on the internet from the entire

4281.159 --> 4287.239
internet of the world they can do that

4284.56 --> 4289.4800000000005
right now it's like a service they

4287.239 --> 4291.759999999999
provide if they flip that switch they

4289.48 --> 4294.12
can do it with an entire subject in the

4291.76 --> 4295.400000000001
entire world you can cut people's

4294.12 --> 4296.5599999999995
tongues out but that doesn't take the

4295.4 --> 4298.92
truth

4296.56 --> 4300.639
away I'm just saying they can do that

4298.92 --> 4302.56
just cutting people's tongues out that's

4300.639 --> 4304.679
just cutting people's tongues out that

4302.56 --> 4307.400000000001
does not stop the truth because whether

4304.679 --> 4309.2390000000005
people go back to libraries they will

4307.4 --> 4311.36
they will stop the truth because people

4309.239 --> 4314.199
are going to be too preoccupied trying

4311.36 --> 4315.88
to survive to even care about the truth

4314.199 --> 4318.638999999999
you will still see that Celestial

4315.88 --> 4320.12
navigation and measurements of geometry

4318.639 --> 4323.4800000000005
still

4320.12 --> 4327.0
concretely substantiate a flat

4323.48 --> 4328.879999999999
plane yeah well in 100 years the manuals

4327.0 --> 4330.6
that from the early 20th century they

4328.88 --> 4332.719
will all be destroyed and they'll all

4330.6 --> 4335.04
have updated manuals in which it's all

4332.719 --> 4338.4
twisted around and pretended like they

4335.04 --> 4342.48
always never use the Horizon and they

4338.4 --> 4344.0
will just do that okay they will just do

4342.48 --> 4346.0
that

4344.0 --> 4348.28
they're not going to let this they're

4346.0 --> 4351.639
not going to let Flat Earth win they'd

4348.28 --> 4354.239
rather exterminate all of humanity

4351.639 --> 4356.719
because they can't they have to

4354.239 --> 4362.08
perpetuate this lie it's like the

4356.719 --> 4362.08
fundamental satanic oath that gives them

4362.56 --> 4368.320000000001
rulership they have to lie if they're

4365.32 --> 4371.719
not basing what they do on a fundamental

4368.32 --> 4373.719
lie then they lose

4371.719 --> 4374.6
ownership it's how this [ __ ] [ __ ]

4373.719 --> 4377.28
world

4374.6 --> 4380.76
works if you're not a demon you don't

4377.28 --> 4382.28
get the rule you must

4380.76 --> 4384.1990000000005
lie

4382.28 --> 4387.719
sorry are you still there you got you

4384.199 --> 4390.5599999999995
got a you got a point so they can't they

4387.719 --> 4392.96
if like they can never admit it so so

4390.56 --> 4395.280000000001
what do you do so in order to survive

4392.96 --> 4397.08
are are you are you implying not saying

4395.28 --> 4399.239
but are you implying that in order to

4397.08 --> 4402.36
survive you better get on the line on

4399.239 --> 4405.0
the line um bag and wagon no it's a

4402.36 --> 4409.719
matter of are you going to die for the

4405.0 --> 4409.719
truth or are you going to survive for

4412.28 --> 4418.719
lies I'm ready to die and I mean and I'm

4415.679 --> 4420.88
not going to just let let them kill me

4418.719 --> 4422.679
I'll take a couple of them with me for

4420.88 --> 4426.400000000001
sure you go that's that's what I'm

4422.679 --> 4429.6
saying yep but I mean like I know what's

4426.4 --> 4432.5199999999995
going to happen I know it was all just a

4429.6 --> 4434.56
little tease to bring out the good in

4432.52 --> 4436.88
people just so they could snuff it out

4434.56 --> 4439.679
because that's what they do in

4436.88 --> 4443.12
governments they try to bring out the

4439.679 --> 4446.92
good in people just so they can snuff it

4443.12 --> 4446.92
out it's what they

4452.36 --> 4459.599999999999
do but let's not

4455.0 --> 4462.88
uh roll into the darkness that much I

4459.6 --> 4464.159000000001
can see that it's muting you I'm just

4462.88 --> 4468.04
saying like

4464.159 --> 4470.48
I there was the Flat Earth Awakening it

4468.04 --> 4473.0
was amazing but they really only did it

4470.48 --> 4476.678999999999
just to extinguish

4473.0 --> 4478.96
it and they are it's proving itself it's

4476.679 --> 4482.04
proven that it is being exposed and

4478.96 --> 4485.8
there's like millions of people that are

4482.04 --> 4488.4
now just full on Jesuit conditioned to

4485.8 --> 4491.76
reinforce the globe yeah that didn't

4488.4 --> 4493.599999999999
exist 20 years ago people didn't know

4491.76 --> 4495.92
what the hell to do if they f face the

4493.6 --> 4498.639
Flat Earth or they would get existential

4495.92 --> 4503.4400000000005
crisis if if if they were told this

4498.639 --> 4506.08
information now there's full on bardia

4503.44 --> 4509.799999999999
people make their own excuses they've

4506.08 --> 4513.04
basically programmed the Jesuit system

4509.8 --> 4516.6
into the general public by unleashing

4513.04 --> 4517.92
Flat Earth and soon they'll won't need

4516.6 --> 4519.72
Flat Earth

4517.92 --> 4522.1990000000005
anymore they won't need

4519.72 --> 4525.2390000000005
[Music]

4522.199 --> 4528.08
it nobody will kill flat earther yeah I

4525.239 --> 4530.32
know nobody will kill flat earthers but

4528.08 --> 4533.239
you'll never get a job you'll get

4530.32 --> 4535.5599999999995
bullied and it will just keep going and

4533.239 --> 4537.32
going until you kill yourself yeah in

4535.56 --> 4538.92
the end the flat earthers will kill

4537.32 --> 4543.159
themselves because there's

4538.92 --> 4546.04
no place left to go for them that is

4543.159 --> 4548.44
what will happen yeah flat earthers will

4546.04 --> 4550.32
be worse off than the

4548.44 --> 4554.599999999999
Palestinians that's what I'm talking

4550.32 --> 4556.239
about yeah nowhere left to go

4554.6 --> 4559.76
that's what they do that's how they will

4556.239 --> 4559.759999999999
do it nowhere left to

4560.96 --> 4565.639
go why can't a flat earther get a job

4563.52 --> 4567.360000000001
because they won't be given a job

4565.639 --> 4569.719
because if they'll be given a job then

4567.36 --> 4573.08
the boss will have a flat earther on

4569.719 --> 4575.8
record in his job being an anti-semite

4573.08 --> 4579.5599999999995
being super intolerant in some way and

4575.8 --> 4583.639
they'll get like giant fines and then

4579.56 --> 4585.159000000001
they have to fire the flat earther they

4583.639 --> 4588.52
must do

4585.159 --> 4591.96
it or their business goes

4588.52 --> 4594.52
bust that is where it's

4591.96 --> 4596.36
going yeah unless you're completely

4594.52 --> 4599.2390000000005
self-sufficient and you're willing to

4596.36 --> 4601.88
take that financial burden and a lot of

4599.239 --> 4604.32
people want if you're people like Adam

4601.88 --> 4607.6
mein then literally it's like yeah I'll

4604.32 --> 4610.44
just take a little bit less money on

4607.6 --> 4613.52
average I'll manage right because they

4610.44 --> 4615.96
can if you're not a self-sufficient guy

4613.52 --> 4617.88
that's like really worked their way up

4615.96 --> 4620.56
you're not going to

4617.88 --> 4623.1990000000005
survive yeah and then eventually there

4620.56 --> 4627.719
will be nobody left in high positions to

4623.199 --> 4630.28
even do that it will just be flunkies

4627.719 --> 4632.76
and cowards and Pie of [ __ ] sellouts

4630.28 --> 4636.04
that will have all the power and no flat

4632.76 --> 4638.719
earther will be able to get a job ever

4636.04 --> 4640.6
again and if you try to make a job

4638.719 --> 4642.4800000000005
yourself they'll literally get in your

4640.6 --> 4644.679
way with [ __ ] environmental

4642.48 --> 4647.08
regulations in anything they can think

4644.679 --> 4649.52
of just to make it completely impossible

4647.08 --> 4651.6
for you to make any form of money ever

4649.52 --> 4654.96
again

4651.6 --> 4657.56
yeah I'm sorry de ro maybe I'm ruining

4654.96 --> 4659.84
your day no I'm listen I'm

4657.56 --> 4661.96
listening I give your point it goes back

4659.84 --> 4665.12
to what I was saying before like you

4661.96 --> 4668.76
said what they've done they made a an

4665.12 --> 4672.0
equivalent parallel to

4668.76 --> 4675.719
um Flat Earth compared to the

4672.0 --> 4678.48
transgender situation where violation oh

4675.719 --> 4681.2390000000005
sorry I have to violation of the US

4678.48 --> 4682.44

me who gives it like you think that that

4685.239 --> 4691.919999999999
is still relevant to anything yeah Black

4688.679 --> 4694.52
Rock owns everything who the [ __ ] gives

4691.92 --> 4697.88
a [ __ ] about Constitution we're in a Neo

4694.52 --> 4701.88
feudal State the entire [ __ ] world is

4697.88 --> 4704.2390000000005
it's still like an act to pretend like

4701.88 --> 4707.4800000000005
there are some kind of like democracy or

4704.239 --> 4711.199
Republic out there yeah it's all one

4707.48 --> 4714.28
monolithic piece of money yeah and all

4711.199 --> 4715.919999999999
it wants is to own everything and kill

4714.28 --> 4721.159
everyone

4715.92 --> 4725.0
yeah a constitution like that's a

4721.159 --> 4727.12
myth I'll just say it's a myth yeah you

4725.0 --> 4730.719
think that's going to make a difference

4727.12 --> 4733.199
oh discrimination oh re have you looked

4730.719 --> 4735.6
have you actually looked in your country

4733.199 --> 4740.32
concerning discrimination

4735.6 --> 4742.8
yeah no only the people that they want

4740.32 --> 4745.599999999999
not to have any power not to have any

4742.8 --> 4747.84
money are going to get burdened for

4745.6 --> 4750.76
supposed discrimination until they're

4747.84 --> 4754.56
gone the people that they are that they

4750.76 --> 4758.1990000000005
like that they want to rule they can do

4754.56 --> 4760.4400000000005
whatever the [ __ ] they want like

4770.28 --> 4775.199
that is how it works Buck sad Buster

4773.0 --> 4778.4
asks how would anyone even know whether

4775.199 --> 4780.36
someone is a flat Earth or Not by I mean

4778.4 --> 4782.879999999999
if you open your mouth and social media

4780.36 --> 4785.199
activity you just have the algorithm

4782.88 --> 4787.52
find the words there you

4785.199 --> 4790.08
go hold

4787.52 --> 4793.8
on I mean he probably doesn't know what

happened to um what was it chocolate

4793.8 --> 4797.84
yeah was it chocolate or was it was it

4795.8 --> 4799.6
CH yeah I think it was chocolate and we

4797.84 --> 4801.88
all know why chocolate was was being

4799.6 --> 4804.88
treated by that one particular manager

4801.88 --> 4807.96
yeah yeah yeah because chocolate

4804.88 --> 4809.159000000001
verbally or either either he he he

4807.96 --> 4811.84
either

4809.159 --> 4814.92
verbally um

4811.84 --> 4817.52
opposed the globe I just told him I

4814.92 --> 4819.76
don't agree with that that wasn't right

4817.52 --> 4822.52
yeah that you definitely are labeled

4819.76 --> 4824.8
just like anything else religion wise

4822.52 --> 4826.280000000001
whatever I mean people even though they

4824.8 --> 4827.84
say you're not supposed to be

4826.28 --> 4832.5199999999995
discriminated you know you should be

4827.84 --> 4835.4400000000005
able to um um what is it called um right

4832.52 --> 4838.8
to work or right for hire shouldn't be

4835.44 --> 4840.879999999999
against gender religion um whatever they

4838.8 --> 4844.08
all the different labels still at the

4840.88 --> 4846.4400000000005
end of the day they're still practicing

4844.08 --> 4849.28
it they're they're discriminated against

4846.44 --> 4851.759999999999
age sex gender

4849.28 --> 4853.159
religion you know all all the labels

that they say you you're not supposed to

4853.159 --> 4857.5599999999995
be discriminated for they definitely do

4855.28 --> 4860.04
it and if you come out your mouth

especially in an interview and and let's

4860.04 --> 4863.12

4883.4 --> 4889.5599999999995
that trust me you'll be put down on the

4886.08 --> 4891.04
bottom of the list to be hired yeah I've

4889.56 --> 4893.76
been on the bottom of the list even

4891.04 --> 4899.32
before Flat Earth

there you go see I gave you the jab and

5847.88 --> 5852.2390000000005
Aran just gave you the uppercut The

5850.36 --> 5854.4
Knockout blow that's the other part of

5852.239 --> 5857.5199999999995
it none of that money goes to whom they

5854.4 --> 5860.5199999999995
say they're giving it to no that that

5857.52 --> 5862.52
money is invested into whoever's going

5860.52 --> 5864.56
to be replacing them yep the

5862.52 --> 5867.4800000000005
gentrification

5864.56 --> 5869.4400000000005
agenda right and yeah it's like oh oh

5867.48 --> 5872.959999999999
they all died and like oh they're all

5869.44 --> 5876.48
slowly dying nobody cares

5872.96 --> 5879.199
know it Maui is just Lial

5876.48 --> 5881.48
island where all the Bill Gates and the

5879.199 --> 5883.598999999999
Bezos and all the other disgusting

5881.48 --> 5886.718999999999
liberals can just roam around and butt

5883.599 --> 5888.7
[ __ ] everybody and and it's all theirs

5886.719 --> 5890.119
it's like what do you mean

5888.7 --> 5891.92
[Music]

5890.119 --> 5896.0
natives

5891.92 --> 5898.56
y we're the natives now it's all it's

5896.0 --> 5900.599
remember it's still all about colon

5898.56 --> 5902.599
colonization it's just another way they

5900.599 --> 5904.84
do it now

5902.599 --> 5906.52
still colonizing still colonizing that's

5904.84 --> 5908.28
all they do

5906.52 --> 5910.76
colonizing

5908.28 --> 5913.04
hey terminate the local people that are

5910.76 --> 5915.04
not part of the satanic system and then

5913.04 --> 5916.239
claim everything that's what I tell

5915.04 --> 5918.32
people it had nothing to do with skin

5916.239 --> 5920.4
color because the colonizers were dark

5918.32 --> 5922.199
skinned kisor were dark skinned

5920.4 --> 5924.119
Portuguese were dark skinned the Spanish

5922.199 --> 5925.879999999999
were dark skinned back in the 12th

5924.119 --> 5928.36
century 11th century 8th Century 7th

5925.88 --> 5930.88
Century there was no it was just it was

5928.36 --> 5931.92
basically the halves taken from the have

5930.88 --> 5934.2390000000005
not

5931.92 --> 5936.52
well they still had the Moors they were

5934.239 --> 5939.199
just right after the Moors had been

5936.52 --> 5941.400000000001
taken South Europe and all that exactly

5939.199 --> 5943.28
so they were still brown but it all kind

5941.4 --> 5946.4
of diluted over time though and it

5943.28 --> 5948.599
become more and more white yeah yeah

5946.4 --> 5950.598999999999
yeah yeah but but we know colonization

5948.599 --> 5952.8
has on this is the weird thing even

5950.599 --> 5955.04
about Spain and Portugal is that the

5952.8 --> 5958.28
Moors really took those but

5955.04 --> 5961.48
then they it got taken back and so a lot

5958.28 --> 5962.639
of Spain was black but then they had all

5961.48 --> 5965.08
this white

5962.639 --> 5966.719
nobility right and the white nobility is

5965.08 --> 5970.599
like the the

5966.719 --> 5973.84
castanic Spanish they actually like Jews

5970.599 --> 5977.0
they're white Jewish saric Jews which

5973.84 --> 5979.96
I'm like all I like those I'm just

5977.0 --> 5983.44
saying I kind of like him it's yeah I

5979.96 --> 5985.92
can't help it maybe just trying but

5983.44 --> 5988.08
point is that they were then at the

5985.92 --> 5990.639
wheel after the Moors basically were

5988.08 --> 5992.44
defeated and a lot of like half black

5990.639 --> 5994.679
people and all that which were just part

5992.44 --> 5997.759999999999
of the Spanish and the Portuguese and

5994.679 --> 5999.8
they then sent them overseas to try to

5997.76 --> 6002.360000000001
like conquer stuff to take over the

5999.8 --> 6006.3
Americans right so why he sent out the

6002.36 --> 6008.5199999999995
brownie to do all their work for them

6006.3 --> 6012.2390000000005
[Music]

6008.52 --> 6015.040000000001
again right but it's weird that history

6012.239 --> 6015.04
how that work with the

6016.28 --> 6021.92
Moors but like I said there's been

6018.88 --> 6025.08
conquering and colonizing

6021.92 --> 6026.56
and I mean going on forever and ever and

6025.08 --> 6029.48
ever and ever and it's still going on

6026.56 --> 6031.119000000001
right now that's what Oprah and all the

6029.48 --> 6033.0
elites are doing now they're conquering

6031.119 --> 6035.199
Maui they're taking over that land they

6033.0 --> 6038.4
did it they did it to they did it to um

6035.199 --> 6040.119
St Kitty St Croy Jamaica the Bahamas

6038.4 --> 6041.44
Bermuda they're doing it everywhere

6040.119 --> 6044.159
everywhere where there's a land of milk

6041.44 --> 6047.638999999999
and honey the parasitic

6044.159 --> 6050.159
vampires that can find some profit in it

6047.639 --> 6052.28
right every no but it's not even a

6050.159 --> 6054.638999999999
prophet it's like

6052.28 --> 6056.159
they can't allow Paradise to exist

6054.639 --> 6059.1990000000005
because if there's a paradise then

6056.159 --> 6062.0
people can live there and be free from

6059.199 --> 6063.4
Satan and lies right they can live free

6062.0 --> 6065.88
from the lies that's what they don't

6063.4 --> 6068.119
want to allow yeah they want to bring

6065.88 --> 6071.76
everybody in a position where nobody

6068.119 --> 6074.04
will even realize that that's possible

6071.76 --> 6076.84
where everybody will just be no we can't

6074.04 --> 6078.76
have Paradise life is Hell everywhere is

6076.84 --> 6081.4800000000005
hell and there's nothing we can do about

6078.76 --> 6084.280000000001
it you need to anything that's like an

6081.48 --> 6086.879999999999
exception to that has to be destroyed

6084.28 --> 6089.4
not to get it but to destroy it so that

6086.88 --> 6091.2390000000005
it's not available for anybody yeah not

6089.4 --> 6093.759999999999
to preserve it but to destroy to

6091.239 --> 6096.239
annihilate it y

6093.76 --> 6097.4800000000005
yep and that's what environmentalists

6096.239 --> 6101.119
are doing

6097.48 --> 6103.48
too they're full of [ __ ] yeah these

6101.119 --> 6108.4
supposed liberal environmentalists all

6103.48 --> 6110.5599999999995
they do is just try to ruin your life

6108.4 --> 6113.5599999999995
and actually destroy nature like as soon

6110.56 --> 6117.1990000000005
as they they get ownership of it to to

6113.56 --> 6119.4400000000005
save it immediately it gets destroyed

6117.199 --> 6121.239
and then after they've allowed it to be

6119.44 --> 6123.36
destroyed then they'll complain and

6121.239 --> 6125.959999999999
blame everybody else for it being

6123.36 --> 6129.159
destroyed after they gained ownership

6125.96 --> 6132.159
and had it destroyed is what they

6129.159 --> 6132.159
do

6132.96 --> 6137.36
yeah yeah all the supposed

6135.0 --> 6141.04
environmentalist here oh oh but that

6137.36 --> 6143.92
means that we can't have Farmers anymore

6141.04 --> 6146.5199999999995
but the forest like our local Forest

6143.92 --> 6149.32
here it could just all be

6146.52 --> 6151.719
cut they're just cutting it it's like

6149.32 --> 6153.28
yeah oh it's Environmental Protection oh

6151.719 --> 6155.599
yeah yeah you can't Farm here and it's

6153.28 --> 6157.48
dangerous oh let's cut this entire

6155.599 --> 6159.4400000000005
original

6157.48 --> 6162.638999999999
Woods just do

6159.44 --> 6166.04
it and they did they just cut it all for

6162.639 --> 6169.92
what for absolutely nothing to feed into

6166.04 --> 6171.76
like this stupid biofuel power plant

6169.92 --> 6175.04
they literally like like caught the

6171.76 --> 6176.4400000000005
entire Woods here like one of the few

6175.04 --> 6177.92
Woods that are even left in the

6176.44 --> 6181.5199999999995
Netherlands they just cut it just to

6177.92 --> 6185.96
feed it into a [ __ ] biofuel [ __ ]

6181.52 --> 6187.320000000001
project of theirs for absolutely nothing

6185.96 --> 6190.679
and those are supposedly

6187.32 --> 6193.159
environmentalists helping to protect us

6190.679 --> 6195.76
well these environmentalists cut down

6193.159 --> 6198.04
entire forests they did do it for

6195.76 --> 6200.400000000001
something they did it for

6198.04 --> 6201.239
profit there's no profit there's no

6200.4 --> 6205.44
profit

6201.239 --> 6208.4
in holistic natural remedies natural

6205.44 --> 6210.598999999999
survival methods or you know they always

6208.4 --> 6213.4
have to take that what is natural

6210.599 --> 6217.84
synthesize it or control it and then

6213.4 --> 6219.799999999999
risp it at a charge to the people yeah

6217.84 --> 6222.0
with the with the GU in the guise of

6219.8 --> 6223.76
saying they're improving it because it

6222.0 --> 6225.239
was it was falling apart nature didn't

6223.76 --> 6228.400000000001
know how to take care of itself so we're

6225.239 --> 6231.199
coming here to cultivate it and reate

6228.4 --> 6233.199
itan trees is bad they produce CO2 cut

6231.199 --> 6235.759999999999
them all down and replace them with

6233.199 --> 6239.239
inflatable Christmas

6235.76 --> 6243.159000000001
trees exactly so you have an idea of

6239.239 --> 6245.44
nature but it won't create any negative

6243.159 --> 6246.44
environmental side effects except for

6245.44 --> 6249.04
all the

6246.44 --> 6253.199
rubber that you're going to have out

6249.04 --> 6255.04
there unrecyclable crap which is yeah I

6253.199 --> 6257.919999999999
I I don't even need to continue this

6255.04 --> 6257.92
train it's so

6258.92 --> 6262.92
insane I don't want to continue this

6261.0 --> 6264.719
train of thinking but I mean that's

6262.92 --> 6266.4800000000005
where they that's what they do it's pure

6264.719 --> 6269.56
satanic and they're going to keep doing

6266.48 --> 6269.5599999999995
it and keep doing it

6269.88 --> 6275.32
until not just like just saying stop

6273.719 --> 6277.56
isn't

6275.32 --> 6279.119
enough that's where I'm at it's not

6277.56 --> 6280.52
enough like if you say stop they're just

6279.119 --> 6281.679
going to move to the next thing then you

6280.52 --> 6283.320000000001
say stop to that and then they

6281.679 --> 6286.4800000000005
immediately move to the next thing and

6283.32 --> 6289.799999999999
they will just keep moving to the next

6286.48 --> 6292.678999999999
thing and you can say no forever they'll

6289.8 --> 6295.2390000000005
just keep moving to the next thing they

6292.679 --> 6298.52
won't stop they have to be

6295.239 --> 6300.718999999999
stopped permanently because they're not

6298.52 --> 6302.8
going to stop they will not stop trying

6300.719 --> 6304.719
to destroy

6302.8 --> 6307.320000000001
everything they're not going to stop

6304.719 --> 6309.84
doing that they will move on to the next

6307.32 --> 6312.719
thing you thought that they run out of

6309.84 --> 6315.119000000001
ideas they won't they will always find

6312.719 --> 6316.599
something else that they can destroy and

6315.119 --> 6318.96
then you have to like make all this

6316.599 --> 6321.56
effort again the protest again and again

6318.96 --> 6323.76
and again because they will never stop

6321.56 --> 6324.92
they will never stop actively trying to

6323.76 --> 6329.159000000001
destroy

6324.92 --> 6329.159
everything until they are

6329.639 --> 6334.4400000000005
annihilated

6331.719 --> 6338.199
yeah how long is it going to

6334.44 --> 6340.638999999999
take before people like realize that and

6338.199 --> 6340.638999999999
then do

6344.56 --> 6349.360000000001
it like another 100 years are we going

6347.08 --> 6352.44
to like sit through another 100 Years of

6349.36 --> 6354.759999999999
just [ __ ] insane Elites just

6352.44 --> 6357.119
gradually torturing people and just

6354.76 --> 6359.56
destroying things just for the pleasure

6357.119 --> 6361.839999999999
of seeing the suffering it causes on

6359.56 --> 6363.92
people are we going to sit a 100 years

6361.84 --> 6367.400000000001
for this or are we going to finish him

6363.92 --> 6370.52
off yeah not not [ __ ] put in jail

6367.4 --> 6372.96
finish them off how many putting them in

6370.52 --> 6375.280000000001
jail doesn't work

6372.96 --> 6377.56
how how long have we' been enduring them

6375.28 --> 6380.04
though for like what since the late

6377.56 --> 6383.280000000001
1800s going into the 20th century so

6380.04 --> 6386.199
been like it's been going on 120 125

6383.28 --> 6389.159
years right yeah I don't know how long

6386.199 --> 6390.719
yeah 125 I think 125 years is when it

6389.159 --> 6392.44
really started really getting really

6390.719 --> 6395.44
just crazy everything just started

6392.44 --> 6397.119
getting like synthesized and just [ __ ] I

6395.44 --> 6399.04
mean holistic medicine was totally

6397.119 --> 6401.28
kicked to the curb called quack medicine

6399.04 --> 6402.719
think about think about everything yeah

6401.28 --> 6406.08
think about everything back in the day

6402.719 --> 6408.679
in 1800 1700 it was Hydro you know

6406.08 --> 6410.44
people knew that Hydro healing they knew

6408.679 --> 6412.2390000000005
all about the things about nature about

6410.44 --> 6413.839999999999
using the sources of nature to do the

6412.239 --> 6417.04
things that we're now doing now with

6413.84 --> 6419.8
these factories and these synthesized

6417.04 --> 6423.48
you know mechanisms but it's been about

6419.8 --> 6426.04
125 30 years now so far I would say so I

6423.48 --> 6427.759999999999
would say you know yeah it's going to be

6426.04 --> 6430.199
about another two another 100 years

6427.76 --> 6433.360000000001
before it's Annihilation either

6430.199 --> 6436.799999999999
self-destruction or no but no but I I

6433.36 --> 6438.839999999999
wasn't actually like if this is going to

6436.8 --> 6441.1990000000005
take 100 years there's no going to be

6438.84 --> 6442.360000000001
nothing left well that's what they want

6441.199 --> 6444.839999999999
that's what they want they don't care

6442.36 --> 6447.32
they want it they want people to like oh

6444.84 --> 6449.719
just keep going until you have literally

6447.32 --> 6451.719
nothing left to lose and then you're

6449.719 --> 6454.56
going to finish him up well guess what's

6451.719 --> 6457.84
after that then there is literally

6454.56 --> 6460.88
nothing left y if you wait until there's

6457.84 --> 6463.679
nothing left to lose to destroy what

6460.88 --> 6467.8
needs to be destroyed then there will be

6463.679 --> 6472.76
literally nothing left then you [ __ ]

6467.8 --> 6475.679
retards [ __ ] [ __ ] humans I hate you

6472.76 --> 6478.599
I hate all of you pathetic [ __ ]

6475.679 --> 6481.88

torture that comes to

6483.92 --> 6490.0

you stay silent about it then you know

6490.0 --> 6493.679
you're just as guilty even if you don't

6491.92 --> 6495.4800000000005
voice against it and just sit back and

6493.679 --> 6496.92
be like well you know you're just as

6495.48 --> 6499.08
guilty as the people that are inflicting

6496.92 --> 6499.08
the

6499.239 --> 6502.839999999999
harm

6501.41 --> 6505.5199999999995
[Music]

6502.84 --> 6508.0
right I just want a declar I want a

6505.52 --> 6510.040000000001
piece of paper that just States like if

6508.0 --> 6513.96
you do this and that like you will not

6510.04 --> 6518.28
be persecuted and I'll I'll be

6513.96 --> 6519.84
going yeah I don't need much to to

6518.28 --> 6523.84
actually do

6519.84 --> 6528.0
it I'll gleefully do it like

6523.84 --> 6531.400000000001
yeah but I mean I have to I'm like I'm

6528.0 --> 6533.639
not going to then die

6531.4 --> 6536.48
just to do the right thing so that it

6533.639 --> 6539.08
could stall all over again like blame it

6536.48 --> 6541.638999999999
all on me or something and then do the

6539.08 --> 6545.48
same [ __ ] thing over again like that

6541.639 --> 6548.400000000001
cannot be tolerated it must be

6545.48 --> 6551.5199999999995
finished it must

6548.4 --> 6553.839999999999
finish cannot restart this

6551.52 --> 6555.88
[ __ ] restart is not going to solve

6553.84 --> 6558.76
anything it has to be

6555.88 --> 6561.08
finished all of it the entire root

6558.76 --> 6563.88
system all of this all these [ __ ]

6561.08 --> 6565.32
insane elderly bastards that are all

6563.88 --> 6568.719
playing their [ __ ] games in the

6565.32 --> 6572.0
shadow it has to be finished finished

6568.719 --> 6572.0
off all of

6573.199 --> 6580.04
it dead all of them nobody left to do

6577.44 --> 6580.04
that

6585.52 --> 6590.2390000000005
nobody that's my

6587.76 --> 6592.4800000000005
opinion but then there success as well

6590.239 --> 6595.598999999999
you got to take care of the successors

6592.48 --> 6597.28
too the you got to think about you know

6595.599 --> 6599.0
it's not just old 90 something 80

6597.28 --> 6602.08
something year old men they have their

6599.0 --> 6604.719
successors lined up well you could make

6602.08 --> 6606.0
rules for that you know it's there's no

6604.719 --> 6608.8
point in

6606.0 --> 6610.76
successors the point is is that they

6608.8 --> 6613.360000000001
have too much Freedom too much control

6610.76 --> 6616.96
and there's nobody to do anything about

6613.36 --> 6619.719
it and so [ __ ] oligarchs the wrench

6616.96 --> 6621.8
sticky stinky crazy people can just do

6619.719 --> 6625.28
all these things and and nobody's

6621.8 --> 6628.56
stopping them MH if you have rules for

6625.28 --> 6632.36
it like yeah you can't do that anymore

6628.56 --> 6637.04
at all like there's no more secret

6632.36 --> 6640.5199999999995
societies like make that completely

6637.04 --> 6641.92
illegal who who will Who is who are the

6640.52 --> 6643.320000000001
powers that are going to make it

6641.92 --> 6646.079
completely illegal so you're saying

6643.32 --> 6648.119
after you remove the corrupt than the

6646.079 --> 6650.28
ones that are left seated who can make

6648.119 --> 6652.719
these legislations and and laws and

6650.28 --> 6655.36
rules they'll be the ones we can entrust

6652.719 --> 6657.8
to make these laws where you can no

6655.36 --> 6659.719
longer have what you're saying will be

6657.8 --> 6663.679
forbidden

6659.719 --> 6667.76
right I I I don't have the full

6663.679 --> 6670.88
picture I just know like you can't just

6667.76 --> 6674.4400000000005
have oh a simple switch like it doesn't

6670.88 --> 6678.079
work like it's so deep rooted it's so

6674.44 --> 6679.678999999999
burrowed in yeah so deeply burrowed in

6678.079 --> 6681.96
all of this system that the people that

6679.679 --> 6683.88
are actually controlling it they don't

6681.96 --> 6686.159
even know what the [ __ ] going on

6683.88 --> 6688.400000000001
anymore yeah they're just they're

6686.159 --> 6690.119
planning things they don't even know

6688.4 --> 6692.36
what they're doing and they literally

6690.119 --> 6694.598999999999
are like demented freaks they don't know

6692.36 --> 6697.32
what it is that they're doing but the

6694.599 --> 6700.400000000001
people that they basically tell what to

6697.32 --> 6702.199
do they those people then interpret and

6700.4 --> 6705.679
they just do all

6702.199 --> 6707.36
that right people at the helm they

6705.679 --> 6709.679
literally don't know what they're doing

6707.36 --> 6712.36
anymore they're just following a system

6709.679 --> 6715.639
that leads to Total Annihilation and

6712.36 --> 6718.88
they don't realize that all they think

6715.639 --> 6721.1990000000005
is no we stay in power that's all that

6718.88 --> 6723.52
matters they don't realize it or even

6721.199 --> 6726.44
care perhaps that they're going to just

6723.52 --> 6728.52
go to complete Annihilation Richard G

6726.44 --> 6730.239
made a good point he said they've scared

6728.52 --> 6732.1990000000005
a lot of people from even wanting to go

6730.239 --> 6735.44
out into nature that's true they put

6732.199 --> 6739.44
such a taboo on nature people are now

6735.44 --> 6741.879999999999
conformed to indoors air conditioning

6739.44 --> 6741.879999999999
ttin to

6741.92 --> 6747.719
Windows like yeah yeah because they're

6745.0 --> 6750.0
afraid that you might get your virus

6747.719 --> 6751.32
yeah something that doesn't even exist

6750.0 --> 6753.48
well a snake might bite you or a

6751.32 --> 6754.679
mountain lion might eat you or a bear

6753.48 --> 6757.159
might attack

6754.679 --> 6759.92
you oh

6757.159 --> 6761.759999999999
no we go sh we go camping at least three

6759.92 --> 6764.079
times a year and take the children with

6761.76 --> 6765.92
us and in mind you it's not one of those

6764.079 --> 6768.28
just drive out to some remote area and

6765.92 --> 6770.679
just set up camp not knowing you know we

6768.28 --> 6773.239
go to an established campsite site

6770.679 --> 6778.0
that's you know it's it's it's it's far

6773.239 --> 6781.28
far far away from you know uh industrial

6778.0 --> 6783.76
you know but it's not raw dog yeah it's

6781.28 --> 6785.5599999999995
it's jacked it's it's gentrified nature

6783.76 --> 6787.84
basically yeah exactly yeah but it's

6785.56 --> 6791.360000000001
still deemed safe the water quality

6787.84 --> 6793.92
checked and Etc all that yeah no wild

6791.36 --> 6795.679
unexpected [ __ ] yeah it's got the little

6793.92 --> 6797.8
bathrooms you can go to you know what

6795.679 --> 6800.28
I'm saying shower shower houses and

6797.8 --> 6802.719
stuff like that so it's it's

6800.28 --> 6804.719
you know but still the children get to

6802.719 --> 6807.159
feel that walking through the woods and

6804.719 --> 6808.96
smelling that fresh air and it's

6807.159 --> 6812.679
necessary especially when you're young

6808.96 --> 6815.96
children because there's all this like

6812.679 --> 6817.84
stuff bacterial stuff all that you need

6815.96 --> 6820.079
to have that pass through you when

6817.84 --> 6821.4800000000005
you're young if you don't get that pass

6820.079 --> 6824.32
through you when you're young if you

6821.48 --> 6827.36
don't dig in the dirt as like a a baby

6824.32 --> 6830.759999999999
and and stuff some dirt in your mouth

6827.36 --> 6832.4
you're going to be like immune rippled

6830.76 --> 6834.84
when you're older exactly you're going

6832.4 --> 6836.5599999999995
to have asthma you're going to have

6834.84 --> 6839.32
allergies you're going to have all that

6836.56 --> 6842.4800000000005
[ __ ] if you don't as a little kid as a

6839.32 --> 6845.599
pre-teen at least like literally go out

6842.48 --> 6847.919999999999
in nature and just let it go through you

6845.599 --> 6850.639
yeah must do that think about what you

6847.92 --> 6854.4
just said and that same child has been

6850.639 --> 6856.2390000000005
um inoculated and vaccinated from God NE

6854.4 --> 6859.36
from the neonatal out the womb to

6856.239 --> 6860.32
neonatal to annual school school year

6859.36 --> 6862.96
shop

6860.32 --> 6865.639
now that child there has been has been

6862.96 --> 6867.96
induced with the toxins and then they're

6865.639 --> 6869.8
not allowed to go out in nature and and

6867.96 --> 6871.76
do the things you say that person is

6869.8 --> 6874.320000000001
really [ __ ] up but they get brain

6871.76 --> 6876.599
damage yeah you get brain damage from

6874.32 --> 6879.639
that eventually it's not just the toxins

6876.599 --> 6881.88
in the shots and all that it's just like

6879.639 --> 6884.4400000000005
if your immune system is completely

6881.88 --> 6887.28
wrecked you like it will literally start

6884.44 --> 6888.919999999999
eating you from the inside out and you

6887.28 --> 6890.36
will get brain damage you will become

6888.92 --> 6893.36
completely under

6890.36 --> 6893.36
developed

6893.44 --> 6899.4
yep you need it you need to be exposed

6896.599 --> 6903.0
to Nature at a young age at the growing

6899.4 --> 6905.759999999999
age if you don't you're going to become

6903.0 --> 6909.199
weak and there's nothing you can do

6905.76 --> 6912.159000000001
about it there's no other way you can do

6909.199 --> 6914.159
it yeah pharmaceutical industry they

6912.159 --> 6917.079
like to claim that they're supposedly

6914.159 --> 6920.119
helping it's a lie it's exactly the

6917.079 --> 6922.32
opposite of what you need to do exactly

6920.119 --> 6924.759999999999
exactly they're forcing they're

6922.32 --> 6929.079
literally forcing acquired immune

6924.76 --> 6929.079000000001
deficiency syndrome yeah they're forcing

6929.199 --> 6935.799999999999
it they're inducing it so that you can

6932.48 --> 6938.119
become more dependent upon the

6935.8 --> 6940.84
Pharmaceuticals like you said they they

6938.119 --> 6943.119
cause the chaos and then they come they

6940.84 --> 6945.52
they they're the firemen who started the

6943.119 --> 6947.199
fire the [ __ ] farming industry they

6945.52 --> 6949.040000000001
create the cripples and then those

6947.199 --> 6951.48
cripples need medical help all their

6949.04 --> 6953.5199999999995
lives and then they profit from that so

6951.48 --> 6955.5199999999995
they literally are farmers of [ __ ]

6953.52 --> 6957.719
people they create the [ __ ] people

6955.52 --> 6960.0
and then they can parasite off them the

6957.719 --> 6963.88
rest of their lives this is an example

6960.0 --> 6967.36
I've always said they are the arson

6963.88 --> 6970.84
firemen who started the fire come to the

6967.36 --> 6972.88
rescue Sirens are blazing pull out their

6970.84 --> 6977.2390000000005
hoses that

6972.88 --> 6979.119
has um lighter fluid telling you it's

6977.239 --> 6981.4
water and they're spraying the [ __ ] out

6979.119 --> 6982.759999999999
of your home on fire and the fire is

6981.4 --> 6985.839999999999
getting worse and worse and worse and

6982.76 --> 6988.159000000001
they're saying we're doing all we can

6985.84 --> 6989.599
you can see we're blazing this and you

6988.159 --> 6992.48
don't know it's light yeah we're just

6989.599 --> 6994.32
trying to burn out the fires yeah yeah

6992.48 --> 6996.718999999999
because you're too stupid if you just

6994.32 --> 6999.199
make it burn hotter then eventually it

6996.719 --> 7002.0
will like burn out exactly including

6999.199 --> 7003.4
your house though yeah yeah and and

7002.0 --> 7005.239
somebody's on the side like me and you

7003.4 --> 7007.598999999999
saying bruh they're they're literally

7005.239 --> 7009.239
spraying lighter fluid on your house

7007.599 --> 7011.4800000000005
it's not water and you're and they're

7009.239 --> 7013.4
like just leave them alone they know

7011.48 --> 7014.5199999999995
what they're doing you're a conspiracy

7013.4 --> 7016.719
theorist you know what you're talking

7014.52 --> 7020.1990000000005
about get out of my face with that

7016.719 --> 7021.4800000000005
nonsense all praise to the firemen yes

7020.199 --> 7023.839999999999
that's that's that's how these people

7021.48 --> 7027.32
are with big farmer and if you want a

7023.84 --> 7029.84
quicker solution then just use Dynamite

7027.32 --> 7031.92
yeah that's how they blow a burning oil

7029.84 --> 7034.04
wellth they Dynamite it so you just put

7031.92 --> 7036.4800000000005
a piece of dynamite in your a burning

7034.04 --> 7039.92
house and it will probably make the

7036.48 --> 7042.36
flame go out right

7039.92 --> 7044.36
you have a giant crater instead of a

7042.36 --> 7046.5199999999995
house but I mean it will put out the

7044.36 --> 7048.88
fire yeah you

7046.52 --> 7051.280000000001
know after you had all that lighter

7048.88 --> 7053.1990000000005
fluid make it completely un

7051.28 --> 7057.5199999999995
unextinguishable

7053.199 --> 7057.5199999999995
so you have the next option

7058.639 --> 7063.719
Dynamite I'm

7060.32 --> 7063.719
sorry I'll get

7064.079 --> 7068.88
you well I'm G get ready to go bro yeah

flipping out and [ __ ] mean there's so

7137.56 --> 7142.2390000000005
many people that have like in the last

7139.36 --> 7146.079
month just completely flipped out on me

7142.239 --> 7148.32
uhhuh and left it's been real it's sucks

7146.079 --> 7150.36
man but there were also just people that

7148.32 --> 7152.5599999999995
were just trying to manipulate me they

7150.36 --> 7154.28
they came with me they were like thought

7152.56 --> 7158.88
they were a friend and then they're just

7154.28 --> 7160.719
like like oh this is bad that is like

7158.88 --> 7164.4800000000005
why the hell do you think you can get

7160.719 --> 7166.56
away with acting like that towards me

7164.48 --> 7168.759999999999
right like I don't understand you've

7166.56 --> 7170.4400000000005
known me for years why do you think that

7168.76 --> 7174.0
you could get away with

7170.44 --> 7176.44
that I don't understand

7174.0 --> 7179.96
it but maybe they could just not handle

7176.44 --> 7183.04
it and hey I do get there is negativity

7179.96 --> 7185.599
here too and if you're like really over

7183.04 --> 7187.8
sensitive to that [ __ ] then this channel

7185.599 --> 7191.679
is going to be dangerous for you because

7187.8 --> 7197.4800000000005
when I go bad it's it's bad I feel like

7191.679 --> 7200.159
[ __ ] I get really dark it is true and

7197.48 --> 7202.239
you got to yeah if you're like if that's

7200.159 --> 7203.839999999999
too dangerous for you you really need to

7202.239 --> 7206.48
stay

7203.84 --> 7208.4400000000005
away yeah it's uncomfortable don't like

7206.48 --> 7210.799999999999
you know you but that's also why my

7208.44 --> 7214.5199999999995
channel is specifically 12 years and

7210.8 --> 7217.4400000000005
older like I like I'm not going to try

7214.52 --> 7221.719
to be for children I'm not even trying

7217.44 --> 7224.719
it okay exactly so keep that in mind if

7221.719 --> 7228.96
you are part of this channel this is not

7224.719 --> 7233.8
for like weeny boys or whatever like it

7228.96 --> 7236.36
isn't if you're like if the ideas or

7233.8 --> 7238.96
violence or whatever are suddenly a

7236.36 --> 7241.799999999999
sudden anger if that gets to you and it

7238.96 --> 7244.2390000000005
like ruins your day stay the hell away

7241.8 --> 7246.599
from this channel exactly don't because

7244.239 --> 7250.239
it's gonna happen I can't stop it I wish

7246.599 --> 7253.360000000001
I wouldn't have that but I do

7250.239 --> 7255.879999999999
right and I have like unstable moods

7253.36 --> 7258.96
like with the weather like full moon I'm

7255.88 --> 7262.079
going to go nuts M if it's like rainy

7258.96 --> 7264.44
and stormy I'm going to be super cranky

7262.079 --> 7266.88
if it's like suddenly sunny and nice I'm

7264.44 --> 7268.28
going to be exstatic but then the next

7266.88 --> 7272.96
day the weather change and I'm going to

7268.28 --> 7275.119
be all angry again like it just

7272.96 --> 7277.2390000000005
happens I can't stop it and I'm not

7275.119 --> 7279.759999999999
going to like not stream just because I

7277.239 --> 7282.28
certainly have a bad mood or anything

7279.76 --> 7285.4400000000005
exactly because that would make it worse

7282.28 --> 7287.199
if I can't express that then I'm going

7285.44 --> 7289.678999999999
to bottle it up and then it's going to

7287.199 --> 7292.4
like linger for a

7289.679 --> 7295.4800000000005
week that's just how I

7292.4 --> 7297.159
work well it's your show you work it the

7295.48 --> 7299.0
way you want to work it people watch it

7297.159 --> 7301.638999999999
if they want to watch if they don't

7299.0 --> 7304.0
watch something else [ __ ] like a comedy

7301.639 --> 7305.32
if you don't go see a certain comic if

7304.0 --> 7307.84
you don't like their language or if you

7305.32 --> 7309.88
don't like the topic of discussion don't

7307.84 --> 7312.8
complain don't pay your money money to

7309.88 --> 7315.04
be in attendance and then start um

7312.8 --> 7318.360000000001
heckling and don't expect for the

7315.04 --> 7320.719
comedian to chop your head off

7318.36 --> 7323.239
verbally take your take your ass out the

7320.719 --> 7326.96
seat ask for a refund if you can get it

7323.239 --> 7328.48
hopefully and go home and take the loss

7326.96 --> 7331.599
but you're not going to

7328.48 --> 7333.199
change that comedian or that lecturer or

7331.599 --> 7336.119000000001
whoever's speaking you're not going to

7340.199 --> 7345.678999999999
if the suggestion isn't taken then you

7342.32 --> 7347.92
shouldn't like keep holding on with this

7345.679 --> 7350.119
anticipation and expectation like it's

7347.92 --> 7352.639
going to eventually then change like

7350.119 --> 7355.5199999999995

7561.0 --> 7567.639
of a world today yeah yeah Richard G did

7564.48 --> 7571.919999999999

7575.079 --> 7580.799999999999
geopolymer geopolymer and ancient

7578.199 --> 7584.36
structure and all

7580.8 --> 7586.88
that like he says that too there's like

7584.36 --> 7590.199
these places that have just been

7586.88 --> 7592.599
demolished and then partially demolished

7590.199 --> 7595.239
and then they just build over it like

7592.599 --> 7599.52
it's nothing

7595.239 --> 7601.558999999999
there like they were just purposely old

7599.52 --> 7604.1990000000005
ancient things that have been destroyed

7601.559 --> 7607.599
that were just right

7604.199 --> 7610.598999999999
there like that's

7607.599 --> 7610.599
horrible

7611.159 --> 7618.48
like seriously how [ __ ] dare you just

7615.559 --> 7620.1990000000005
destroy like old civilizations just

7618.48 --> 7622.638999999999
because they're not part of your fake

7620.199 --> 7622.638999999999
[ __ ]

7624.32 --> 7628.84
history organizations that do that

7627.04 --> 7632.0
should be

7628.84 --> 7635.159000000001
exterminated like [ __ ] you and don't

7632.0 --> 7640.52
don't you [ __ ] dare erase

7635.159 --> 7642.558999999999
history like they literally destroy

7640.52 --> 7646.639
knowledge just for their [ __ ]

7642.559 --> 7649.59
propaganda it should be like universally

7646.639 --> 7657.939
banned

7649.59 --> 7657.939
[Music]

7662.239 --> 7667.119
universally right but it's unfortunately

7664.4 --> 7669.04
something that secret societies also

7667.119 --> 7674.0
take partake in and

7669.04 --> 7678.36
and it is the most egregious of

7674.0 --> 7682.36
everything they do is like destroy

7678.36 --> 7684.92
history cover up history destroying our

7682.36 --> 7684.92
ancient

7691.4 --> 7696.4
sites yeah and they're all in secret

7693.88 --> 7698.78
Services too and all that and it should

7696.4 --> 7700.96
be they should all be rounded up and

7698.78 --> 7704.079
[Music]

7700.96 --> 7707.88
exterminated if you participate in the

7704.079 --> 7711.239
destruction of History you should be

7707.88 --> 7712.36
given the death penalty point blank just

7711.239 --> 7715.079
like

7712.36 --> 7718.799999999999
that like I don't care what you are who

7715.079 --> 7720.599
you are where you came from how [ __ ]

7718.8 --> 7722.1990000000005
important you think you are or how

7720.599 --> 7724.92
[ __ ] important other people you think

7722.199 --> 7728.48
you are you participate in in the

7724.92 --> 7732.679
willful destruction and cover up of his

7728.48 --> 7736.04
history you should get the death

7732.679 --> 7739.159
penalty just like that

7736.04 --> 7741.92
boom part of society that does

7739.159 --> 7744.53
that everyone in that Society should be

7741.92 --> 7747.72
hunted down and

7744.53 --> 7747.719999999999
[Music]

7755.53 --> 7758.55
[Music]

7757.32 --> 7761.749
killed

7758.55 --> 7761.749
[Music]

7774.8 --> 7781.079000000001
right and and yeah it all depends you

7777.679 --> 7784.4
know like so much has already been done

7781.079 --> 7786.719
in the past but I mean I think that

7784.4 --> 7788.679
every [ __ ] bloodline that basically

7786.719 --> 7793.159
participated in the destruction of

7788.679 --> 7795.76
history for power they should all be

7793.159 --> 7797.759999999999
routed those Bloodlines should end I'm

7795.76 --> 7799.559
not saying like kill the children but

7797.76 --> 7802.280000000001
maybe at least just forceful

7799.559 --> 7804.159000000001
sterilization of that entire Bloodlines

7802.28 --> 7806.32
like you

7804.159 --> 7808.0
participate in the destruction of

7806.32 --> 7811.28
history in favor of a

7808.0 --> 7813.28
lie your bloodline should be permanently

7811.28 --> 7817.5199999999995
ended

7813.28 --> 7820.239
now like no more no more offspring from

7817.52 --> 7820.2390000000005
any of you

7820.43 --> 7825.04
[Music]

7823.199 --> 7827.5199999999995
which makes me kind of nervous about my

7825.04 --> 7831.239
freaking Grandpa it's like what has he

7827.52 --> 7834.52
done I hope he hasn't participated in

7831.239 --> 7834.5199999999995
anything like

7840.8 --> 7844.92
that right but I I don't know man how

7843.639 --> 7847.719
the hell are you're going to eth like

7844.92 --> 7849.39
enforce this it's just like make it make

7847.719 --> 7850.84
lying

7849.39 --> 7854.52
[Music]

7850.84 --> 7858.2390000000005
illegal just make it illegal entirely

7854.52 --> 7859.4800000000005
like permanently no exceptions nothing

7858.239 --> 7861.959999999999
lying

7859.48 --> 7865.4
illegal if you can't say something

7861.96 --> 7865.4
without lying then don't

7865.41 --> 7871.189
[Music]

7877.159 --> 7880.159
speak

7896.4 --> 7900.558999999999
yeah Rich G me

7901.44 --> 7909.159
too so they just unrouted everybody it's

7905.84 --> 7912.2390000000005
all just lies lies lies I'm so [ __ ]

7909.159 --> 7916.5199999999995
done with lies I I mean

7912.239 --> 7920.4
really I'm so done with it it should

7916.52 --> 7922.2390000000005
be there should be a stand made and just

7920.4 --> 7925.119
say like

7922.239 --> 7929.759999999999
yeah lying IL

7925.119 --> 7932.759999999999
legal like to the highest

7929.76 --> 7935.76
standards there should I mean lying you

7932.76 --> 7938.360000000001
know what if they could literally derive

7935.76 --> 7940.679
from rain patterns or signals when

7938.36 --> 7944.639
you're lying and it's just like yeah if

7940.679 --> 7949.0
we detect you lying you die you better

7944.639 --> 7949.0
never ever [ __ ] lie like

7949.639 --> 7957.1990000000005
ever and maybe even you could get rid of

7954.28 --> 7959.84
the ability to lie by

7957.199 --> 7963.48
simply conditioning children to

7959.84 --> 7966.159000000001
literally become incapable of

7963.48 --> 7968.839999999999
lying maybe that would be a solution if

7966.159 --> 7971.199
literally people are incapable of lying

7968.84 --> 7972.96
anymore and that it's illegal under

7971.199 --> 7976.919999999999
penalty of

7972.96 --> 7981.679
death then the world would be completely

7976.92 --> 7981.679
inside out of what we would what we know

7983.36 --> 7991.759999999999
now but at least we might be getting

7986.28 --> 7991.759999999999
somewhere then cuz lies have destroyed

7992.599 --> 7998.599
everything Satan lies have has really

7996.679 --> 8001.079
destroyed everything just take

7998.599 --> 8001.079
everything

8007.48 --> 8012.839999999999
away through electrical signal they

8010.04 --> 8015.679
basic yeah sure Richard

8012.84 --> 8017.4400000000005
G I'm just like taking it further and

8015.679 --> 8019.559
saying like yeah what if you just make

8017.44 --> 8021.678999999999
it illegal and you like you don't even

8019.559 --> 8022.719
have to decipher somebody's information

8021.679 --> 8024.719
you can

8022.719 --> 8027.4
just

8024.719 --> 8030.4800000000005
detect electrically whether they're

8027.4 --> 8032.679
lying or not not not some stupid lie

8030.48 --> 8036.799999999999
detection machine but just like a thing

8032.679 --> 8036.8
that can just read like this person's

8037.36 --> 8040.639
lying like

8056.88 --> 8059.88
that

8062.04 --> 8067.84
right

8063.88 --> 8067.84
anyway that's not going to happen

8068.88 --> 8074.92
probably yeah cuz you only can't lie

8072.28 --> 8077.199
you're only not allowed to lie if it's

8074.92 --> 8079.32
in the detriment of those in power

8077.199 --> 8084.119
that's how it works right

8079.32 --> 8084.119
now lying is fully legalized

8084.52 --> 8089.280000000001
and what you say that

8086.88 --> 8092.8
weaponized

8089.28 --> 8094.92
you're you're allowed to lie if it

8092.8 --> 8097.639
is to

8094.92 --> 8100.88
protect those in

8097.639 --> 8104.96
power if you're not protecting those in

8100.88 --> 8104.96
power then you are not allowed to

8114.96 --> 8120.8
lie and that's terrible that's a

8118.239 --> 8120.799999999999
terrible

8121.239 --> 8127.678999999999
system I mean it's not better than a

8125.0 --> 8127.679
medieval

8128.079 --> 8131.239
system at

8142.44 --> 8147.36
all right because technically like in a

8145.32 --> 8149.92
republic whatever that type of

8147.36 --> 8153.5199999999995
government system you're not allowed to

8149.92 --> 8156.079
lie if you're like in

8153.52 --> 8158.8
control but if it's just corrupted then

8156.079 --> 8161.32
it's just feudal

8158.8 --> 8164.119000000001
again and then you can get away with

8161.32 --> 8167.04
whatever you can get away

8164.119 --> 8169.799999999999
with just call it a republic although it

8167.04 --> 8169.8
is technically

8171.559 --> 8175.4400000000005
feudal right

8176.04 --> 8179.719
anyhow h

8185.32 --> 8190.159
hope you have all been enjoying the show

have run out completely for like two

8626.08 --> 8630.319
weeks

8627.68 --> 8632.880000000001
so I'm kind of sober right now which is

8630.319 --> 8632.88
not very

8633.86 --> 8637.04
[Music]

8637.24 --> 8645.279
pleasant just smoking tobacco

8640.52 --> 8645.279
isn't isn't really all that

8648.08 --> 8653.399
great I did have some really clear

8651.08 --> 8656.479
dreams though that that this does stand

8653.399 --> 8659.84
out to me like this night I had a very

8656.479 --> 8663.08
elaborate dream and I even remember the

8659.84 --> 8666.56
details was basically another emulation

8663.08 --> 8669.24
of my old home from my old town and

8666.56 --> 8670.6
those streets so I was once again in the

8669.24 --> 8673.92
virtual

8670.6 --> 8677.12
parallel version of that town in which

8673.92 --> 8679.439
there is a giant Hill in that town in

8677.12 --> 8681.04
reality it isn't there at all it's all

8679.439 --> 8685.76
pretty much

8681.04 --> 8688.800000000001
flat but I was basically on a

8685.76 --> 8691.359
motorcycle like driving through the

8688.8 --> 8695.08
streets fast

8691.359 --> 8697.04
like on my back wheel just and like on

8695.08 --> 8698.92
an actual motorcycle it was pretty epic

8697.04 --> 8701.76
doing

8698.92 --> 8704.16
that I was on a motorcycle driving

8701.76 --> 8705.92
through those streets I that's weird by

8704.16 --> 8709.68
the way because I've never even had a

8705.92 --> 8712.08
motorcycle in that dreamcap

8709.68 --> 8714.76
before but it was like a real like a

8712.08 --> 8718.279
speed thing like a ducatti

8714.76 --> 8721.92
or something some like really Speedy

8718.279 --> 8724.720000000001
Motor Cycle and it was just driving

8721.92 --> 8724.72
there it was

8741.2 --> 8744.409000000001
[Music]

8745.88 --> 8749.839999999998
epic

8747.479 --> 8752.88
no dreams well that's the thing I still

8749.84 --> 8757.24
had when I smoked cannabis I still had

8752.88 --> 8760.358999999999
dreams it's just not that elaborate it's

8757.24 --> 8764.0
like this sort of Dark World half dream

8760.359 --> 8765.960000000001
and those are great but these types of

8764.0 --> 8769.8
dream that I get when I'm sober they're

8765.96 --> 8769.8
like really distinct

8770.319 --> 8775.92
Dreamscapes instead of just like a just

8773.439 --> 8778.56
a regular simulation I mean it is really

8775.92 --> 8780.359
that it's like I see dreams even as a

8778.56 --> 8783.56
simulation that's something created by

8780.359 --> 8786.960000000001
my mind or another Factor potentially

8783.56 --> 8789.72
even a demon which is

8786.96 --> 8791.438999999998
weird it's like what are those things

8789.72 --> 8794.479
that are actually controlling that on

8791.439 --> 8798.76
the other side who what determines like

8794.479 --> 8798.76
what your dream is going to be you

8799.439 --> 8805.800000000001
know what is doing

8802.16 --> 8807.8
that and when I'm sober I do have more

8805.8 --> 8810.08
elaborate

8807.8 --> 8813.16
dream

8810.08 --> 8815.6
scenarios that kind of like run on the

8813.16 --> 8818.24
same theme throughout my entire life

8815.6 --> 8822.640000000001
it's like the Dreamscape that started

8818.24 --> 8825.72
forming when I was 10 10 years

8822.64 --> 8828.56
old that same Dreamscape is still

8825.72 --> 8830.16
something that I returned to like 30

8828.56 --> 8832.76
years

8830.16 --> 8835.16
later and it's like oh I'm back here

8832.76 --> 8837.399
again it's exactly like what it feels

8835.16 --> 8839.399
like and I don't I'm not older in those

8837.399 --> 8843.0
dreams by the way either I'm always the

8839.399 --> 8843.0
same age

8845.6 --> 8851.56
roughly have nightmares when you quit I

8848.72 --> 8855.679999999998
don't really have

8851.56 --> 8857.68
nightmares I just my waking time is just

8855.68 --> 8860.800000000001
terrible when I'm awake it feels

8857.68 --> 8866.2
terrible a lot of the

8860.8 --> 8868.519999999999
time but I don't have nightmares really

8866.2 --> 8870.880000000001
I haven't had real nightmares since I

8868.52 --> 8870.880000000001
was a

8870.96 --> 8874.8
teen except for the Dark World

8873.24 --> 8877.96
experience but that's different that's

8874.8 --> 8880.599999999999
not just a nightmare that's like a thing

8877.96 --> 8880.599999999999
that's

8881.279 --> 8888.319000000001
separate but it's also because in my

8884.439 --> 8891.0
dreams like I'm not afraid anymore like

8888.319 --> 8895.6
of anything even

8891.0 --> 8895.6
dying I'm just not afraid of

8895.64 --> 8898.64
anything

8898.68 --> 8903.52
so he's even like oh spooky demon I'm

8900.8 --> 8905.679999999998
like you're [ __ ] weak I can destroy

8903.52 --> 8907.92
you just like that there's nothing you

8905.68 --> 8907.92
can

8910.6 --> 8915.2
do so it's like nightmares don't really

8914.04 --> 8918.240000000002
work

8915.2 --> 8920.2
anymore because I just can't be fooled

8918.24 --> 8922.6
like a nightmare only works because

8920.2 --> 8925.279
you're fooled into thinking that those

8922.6 --> 8927.24
Terrible Things are real and then you

8925.279 --> 8928.319000000001
feel it

8927.24 --> 8930.68
that's what makes a nightmare a

8928.319 --> 8933.84
nightmare it doesn't work on me in my

8930.68 --> 8936.84
dreams so it's like oh scary [ __ ]

8933.84 --> 8939.08
thing I can get startled for a bit but

8936.84 --> 8941.84
that's as far as it goes there's no fear

8939.08 --> 8943.68
in my dreams there's no sense of

8941.84 --> 8945.399
powerlessness it's like nothing can take

8943.68 --> 8949.16
away the

8945.399 --> 8952.92
power and the knowledge I

8949.16 --> 8952.92
have in my dream

8953.16 --> 8958.399
form like I know what I am what my power

8956.279 --> 8961.720000000001
is in

8958.399 --> 8964.0
there I know what a dream is I know that

8961.72 --> 8965.56
it is a simulation that's created from

8964.0 --> 8968.64
the

8965.56 --> 8972.0
inside I can tell whether it is a dream

8968.64 --> 8972.0
while I'm experiencing

8972.479 --> 8979.679999999998
it and then still continue

8975.52 --> 8979.68
on without waking up from

8985.52 --> 8988.52
it

8992.12 --> 8996.279
feelings that you're not in control

8993.88 --> 8999.119999999999
right yeah that

8996.279 --> 9002.2
sucks it's weird though that that would

8999.12 --> 9002.2
Express itself in

9003.24 --> 9009.24
dreams maybe a sign that you aren't just

9006.96 --> 9011.0
fully in control yet you're working on

9009.24 --> 9013.0
it but you're not there yet you're still

9011.0 --> 9016.96
unprotected in ways and maybe that is

9013.0 --> 9019.64
why that then that weakness that

9016.96 --> 9022.24
unprotected finds you and expresses

9019.64 --> 9025.519999999999
itself in the dream like a

9022.24 --> 9028.479
warning I'm not sure it could

9025.52 --> 9031.92
be but I don't have those issues and

9028.479 --> 9034.599999999999
dude I'm like emotionally unstable I I

9031.92 --> 9036.72
get like super demoralized by simple

9034.6 --> 9040.720000000001
things and then like my entire day is

9036.72 --> 9043.56
ruined but when I dream it's like I

9040.72 --> 9045.438999999998
don't have nightmares I'm never really

9043.56 --> 9048.439
not in control of

9045.439 --> 9048.439
myself

9075.359 --> 9078.359
h

9104.88 --> 9108.358999999999
right anyhow

9113.99 --> 9117.039999999999
[Music]

9118.08 --> 9121.359
yeah I had plenty of Dreams

9121.72 --> 9129.88
today a dream like with my

9126.16 --> 9129.88
dad which was kind of

9130.399 --> 9136.319
weird and then because it was like in

9133.92 --> 9139.12
her old house but slightly different

9136.319 --> 9144.0
it's like their old my old house is try

9139.12 --> 9147.640000000001
is like reshaped itself it it's not like

9144.0 --> 9150.24
it used to be like 10 20 years ago

9147.64 --> 9152.479
something about the the dream

9150.24 --> 9154.88
representation of my original House in

9152.479 --> 9157.08
my original town has changed for some

9154.88 --> 9159.88
reason maybe it is

9157.08 --> 9162.52
because my mother

9159.88 --> 9164.88
died and I think that my mother's Spirit

9162.52 --> 9167.08
was like a core component in that

9164.88 --> 9170.119999999999
original formation of the house

9167.08 --> 9174.039999999999
representation in my

9170.12 --> 9174.04
dream and it's different

9175.08 --> 9181.6
now like it's really different

9178.399 --> 9184.039999999999
now the the like the way the house is

9181.6 --> 9186.52
inside there it's

9184.04 --> 9188.720000000001
weird but the rest of the town is still

9186.52 --> 9191.12
the same it's still like with these

9188.72 --> 9194.0
weird streets that don't exist and I'm

9191.12 --> 9195.800000000001
like fond of following the roots it's

9194.0 --> 9199.24
like oh yeah going through this place

9195.8 --> 9201.599999999999
again so nostalgic it's always the same

9199.24 --> 9204.199999999999
and it's always completely not like it

9201.6 --> 9208.279
is in reality but

9204.2 --> 9211.279
it's that not like that in the same way

9208.279 --> 9213.92
it's like the same virtual different

9211.279 --> 9218.12
place every

9213.92 --> 9220.52
time like I'm at the point where I can

9218.12 --> 9222.0
like draw it I could I'm not going to

9220.52 --> 9225.359
because I'm kind of nervous what would

9222.0 --> 9227.92
happen it might like disrupt the actual

9225.359 --> 9230.439
cohesion of the dream it's very pleasant

9227.92 --> 9232.04
that I have that place there I'm afraid

9230.439 --> 9234.68
that if I'm going to draw it out that

9232.04 --> 9237.52
might like disrupt the actual dream

9234.68 --> 9240.880000000001
experience if I do that but I could

9237.52 --> 9244.84
technically like draw the

9240.88 --> 9244.839999999998
roots that I go

9245.8 --> 9251.479
there and they're

9248.08 --> 9253.399
like that doesn't exist like that in the

9251.479 --> 9256.72
real

9253.399 --> 9259.199999999999
world it's very different in the real

9256.72 --> 9261.0
world like there's even areas where

9259.2 --> 9263.960000000001
there's like industry and everything

9261.0 --> 9265.52
that aren't there in the real world it's

9263.96 --> 9268.759999999998
like yeah but it's there in the dream

9265.52 --> 9271.6
world though in that place and there's

9268.76 --> 9274.64
these Hills that in the real world

9271.6 --> 9277.2
aren't there in the center of

9274.64 --> 9280.039999999999
town with all these roads going over

9277.2 --> 9283.08
them and all these shops and like snack

9280.04 --> 9285.439
bars in those virtual places that are

9283.08 --> 9288.84
like absolutely not there in the real

9285.439 --> 9291.76
world but I go by there every time I've

9288.84 --> 9293.6
even like played in

9291.76 --> 9296.800000000001
like Game

9293.6 --> 9300.0
Machines like are in gambling [ __ ] like

9296.8 --> 9303.358999999999
silly the coin drop stuff games and

9300.0 --> 9306.72
computer G like arcade games in snack

9303.359 --> 9309.76
bars in those virtual places that don't

9306.72 --> 9312.92
exist on the hilly territory that isn't

9309.76 --> 9315.56
there in the town where I used to live

9312.92 --> 9317.72
and like oh I want to go back to that

9315.56 --> 9319.439
snack bar because they have that gaming

9317.72 --> 9322.08
machine like that's what it's like in

9319.439 --> 9324.800000000001
that dream world it's like every I know

9322.08 --> 9327.12
everything that's there I know it better

9324.8 --> 9329.519999999999
than I know the real town in the real

9327.12 --> 9332.359
world even I'm not joking I know the

9329.52 --> 9335.08
Dreamscape there better than I ever knew

9332.359 --> 9337.720000000001
the real town in the real world it's

9335.08 --> 9337.72
weird how that

9344.96 --> 9350.24
works

9347.12 --> 9354.240000000002
and I mean it has that that bizarre

9350.24 --> 9358.039999999999
train station too like a multiplatform

9354.24 --> 9361.279
train station they those don't exist at

9358.04 --> 9363.800000000001
all but it's there there's this one big

9361.279 --> 9366.640000000001
train station and it's like a like a

9363.8 --> 9369.96
tunnel it's a tunnel and it has like

9366.64 --> 9371.88
four platforms above each other with a

9369.96 --> 9374.919999999998
central space where you can literally

9371.88 --> 9377.519999999999
see all of it and the trains go on four

9374.92 --> 9380.439
different platforms above one another

9377.52 --> 9384.319000000001
with one giant opening on the beginning

9380.439 --> 9386.68
with walking staircases it is like one

9384.319 --> 9390.359
of the most bizarre train stations that

9386.68 --> 9393.720000000001
I'd ever seen it exists there in my

9390.359 --> 9396.0
dream world it's right next to my

9393.72 --> 9399.199999999999
town in the real world there is

9396.0 --> 9402.479
absolutely no such train station at

9399.2 --> 9405.640000000001
all but it ex yeah in but it exists in

9402.479 --> 9408.358999999999
that dream world there and I just know

9405.64 --> 9411.96
what it looks like I could draw how that

9408.359 --> 9415.24
train station looks it's really

9411.96 --> 9417.24
weird I've never seen any train station

9415.24 --> 9419.399
look like that

9417.24 --> 9422.0
ever but it was

9419.399 --> 9425.278999999999
fascinating it's almost like a crossover

9422.0 --> 9428.439
between an open large multiflor shopping

9425.279 --> 9431.04
mall and a train

9428.439 --> 9433.76
station there's no shopping malls in it

9431.04 --> 9435.439
though it's just the trains but it's all

9433.76 --> 9438.68
so open that it kind of looked like a

9435.439 --> 9438.68
big shopping mall it's

9458.52 --> 9466.439
weird

9461.0 --> 9469.52
what 6051 R Bar event what

9466.439 --> 9469.52
I don't know what you're talking

9471.359 --> 9476.800000000001
about anyway yeah I've had dreams and

9474.84 --> 9480.2
I'm referencing them now and they're all

9476.8 --> 9483.0
very clear in my head still and it's

9480.2 --> 9484.52
just weird it's like maybe I always

9483.0 --> 9485.8
thought that at some point I was going

9484.52 --> 9490.16
to like

9485.8 --> 9491.438999999998
create that town in like a 3D space for

9490.16 --> 9495.399
a game or

9491.439 --> 9498.92
something any way I secretly want that I

9495.399 --> 9503.399
want a game where I can be in that dream

9498.92 --> 9506.2
town and like have every detail of in my

9503.399 --> 9510.039999999999
dreams digitally in

9506.2 --> 9513.439
that in that game creation like every

9510.04 --> 9513.439
detail I wanted in

9514.96 --> 9520.88
there I just don't know what kind of

9517.52 --> 9524.24
game it would be definitely not some

9520.88 --> 9526.438999999998
stupid GTA crap or

9524.24 --> 9528.76
anything I just don't don't know what it

9526.439 --> 9530.960000000001
would be then it would probably have to

9528.76 --> 9533.439
be some kind of story driven mystery

9530.96 --> 9533.438999999998
thing or

9538.68 --> 9544.24
something but I mean yeah that that

9541.359 --> 9546.24
dream town the dream version of it I

9544.24 --> 9548.16
have a very fun memory of it and it's

9546.24 --> 9550.119999999999
every time I go there again it's like oh

9548.16 --> 9553.52
wow I'm here again

9550.12 --> 9556.319000000001
wow it's just parallel it's parallel to

9553.52 --> 9559.560000000001
physical reality it's always been there

9556.319 --> 9559.56
it's always looked like

9560.359 --> 9565.68
that and it was constructed too it's

9563.439 --> 9568.24
like it had been updated during my

9565.68 --> 9571.800000000001
lifetime for example that bizarre train

9568.24 --> 9576.479
station thing it wasn't there at the

9571.8 --> 9578.84
start I saw its construction in

9576.479 --> 9583.76
phases throughout my

9578.84 --> 9586.2
teens I saw it when it was just all flat

9583.76 --> 9588.72
grasslands and then they were building

9586.2 --> 9590.640000000001
it in that dream and I would like see it

9588.72 --> 9593.24
in the distance being

9590.64 --> 9595.358999999999
built and then eventually I ended up

9593.24 --> 9598.359
there and it's like whoa this is

9595.359 --> 9600.800000000001
impressive but there it's very elaborate

9598.359 --> 9604.08
because that train station could also

9600.8 --> 9606.599999999999
connect to what was then like a

9604.08 --> 9611.2
simulation of

9606.6 --> 9612.720000000001
utra and that utra there is like

9611.2 --> 9615.720000000001
completely

9612.72 --> 9618.599999999999
different and I mean completely

9615.72 --> 9622.16
unrecognizably different from what this

9618.6 --> 9625.56
city that I now live in is like totally

9622.16 --> 9629.119999999999
different like completely

9625.56 --> 9633.16
surreal where there's like

9629.12 --> 9636.84
trins that are just on Platforms in the

9633.16 --> 9640.279
air and [ __ ] it's all just like a giant

9636.84 --> 9642.56
a gigantic internal building with like

9640.279 --> 9646.08
trains going straight through it and

9642.56 --> 9649.319
like staircases every really Weir

9646.08 --> 9653.0
that City really strange but that's

9649.319 --> 9656.319
connected up to that one St train

9653.0 --> 9658.8
station in my original town in its form

9656.319 --> 9662.0
as it is in my dreams and it connected

9658.8 --> 9665.278999999999
up to this place but it looks like

9662.0 --> 9668.479
totally nothing like utra actually looks

9665.279 --> 9671.0
like nothing like it at all while my

9668.479 --> 9673.08
original Hometown does really

9671.0 --> 9676.16
reminiscent what it looks like there's

9673.08 --> 9679.16
just certain alterations it's weird it's

9676.16 --> 9679.16
weird realizing

9680.8 --> 9688.24
that I never really got to explore too

9683.92 --> 9688.24
much of this the Dreamscape version of

9689.72 --> 9695.92
UT it was kind of dark like there was

9693.52 --> 9698.68
not a lot of sunlight in there there was

9695.92 --> 9702.399
no Open Sky you see it was all inside

9698.68 --> 9704.76
one gigantic building kind of all of it

9702.399 --> 9707.84
everything was basically underground for

9704.76 --> 9707.84
some Myster serious

9708.08 --> 9714.319
reason and my hometown isn't it never

9711.12 --> 9715.12
was there it wasn't not not like that

9714.319 --> 9718.6
it's

9715.12 --> 9722.240000000002
just yeah but I do like remember

9718.6 --> 9724.279
traveling from my town to this place the

9722.24 --> 9726.359
way it was in my dream and then like

9724.279 --> 9729.279
going around and like even getting lost

9726.359 --> 9732.399000000001
in the train stations and getting robbed

9729.279 --> 9736.960000000001
in the train station of the virtual fake

9732.399 --> 9739.16
utrack there it's weird really weird but

9736.96 --> 9741.199999999999
I have all these memories like parallel

9739.16 --> 9743.119999999999
things that happen in my Dreamscape

9741.2 --> 9744.640000000001
because it's like an ongoing simulation

9743.12 --> 9747.04
that's run all my

9744.64 --> 9751.72
life that's just run

9747.04 --> 9753.640000000001
parallel oh I got a new Dune ad

9751.72 --> 9755.319
advertisement can't wait by the way I

9753.64 --> 9759.039999999999
mean I'm very curious what the the

9755.319 --> 9759.039999999999
second Dune movie is going to be

9759.319 --> 9767.359
