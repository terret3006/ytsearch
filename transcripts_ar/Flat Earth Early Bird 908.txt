that would be much appreciated

79.68 --> 86.08000000000001
so you can already probably

83.04 --> 89.68
guess the weather

86.08 --> 93.67999999999999
today is pretty beautiful

89.68 --> 98.0
it's another day like yesterday very

93.68 --> 101.43900000000001
yeah sunny a lot of blue sky

98.0 --> 103.68
some clouds around less than yesterday

101.439 --> 105.19999999999999
and yeah there's a bit of a breeze but

103.68 --> 108.399
it's just nice and warm

105.2 --> 109.119
because there's so much sun there's a

108.399 --> 114.24
people

109.119 --> 129.84
out there picnicking and playing games

114.24 --> 129.84
pregnant girl awesome stuff

143.2 --> 145.51999999999998
so

149.44 --> 161.12
it's saturday the 29th of may 2021

156.16 --> 164.48
ah month of may is almost over

161.12 --> 166.8
how quickly that all slipped by

164.48 --> 168.64
all right hello good servant first in

166.8 --> 171.76000000000002
chat circo

168.64 --> 185.83999999999997
good to see you

171.76 --> 185.84
are we all doing

189.76 --> 194.72
all right so

195.44 --> 199.35999999999999
yeah yesterday was pretty decent it's

198.4 --> 201.44
like

199.36 --> 203.59900000000002
half of the day i didn't even have too

201.44 --> 206.319
much of an ache

203.599 --> 206.319
in my jaw

210.56 --> 214.159
still have it though but it's yeah well

213.519 --> 217.04
it's just

214.159 --> 217.67999999999998
it's i call it it's migrated so now it's

217.04 --> 221.12
just

217.68 --> 224.239
expressing itself in a different way

221.12 --> 227.59900000000002
more local pressure situation

224.239 --> 228.0
not so much the inflamed effect so i

227.599 --> 230.48
guess

228.0 --> 232.56
it's on to that phase right it's a

230.48 --> 235.67999999999998
process

232.56 --> 239.28
so it's probably just like now it's like

235.68 --> 241.68
the the pus forming time or whatever

239.28 --> 242.319
because that's usually when it gets less

241.68 --> 246.0
inflamed

242.319 --> 248.39999999999998
more pressurized but yeah

246.0 --> 250.72
not going to be a lot or anything it's

248.4 --> 254.08
just a phase

250.72 --> 258.479
i think i'll be like by monday i think

254.08 --> 261.44
it'll be all gone so i'm doing all right

258.479 --> 262.0
being very careful with all this and

261.44 --> 264.08
yeah

262.0 --> 267.84
still had dinner and all that right so

264.08 --> 271.59999999999997
despite all that i can still eat

267.84 --> 274.23999999999995
uh thank god for that it's been worse

271.6 --> 274.24
in the past

275.44 --> 278.479
but then again i didn't have any

277.04 --> 281.759
magnesium

278.479 --> 284.96
which oddly enough i can't like

281.759 --> 288.0
really pinpoint it too specifically but

284.96 --> 288.88
yeah every time i have like really acute

288.0 --> 292.16
pain

288.88 --> 295.68
from whatever like pressure

292.16 --> 298.32000000000005
or some food or the temperature

295.68 --> 298.8
like every time i take just a little

298.32 --> 303.039
shot

298.8 --> 306.8
of magnesium in water and just

303.039 --> 308.88
flush it around there like it instantly

306.8 --> 310.16
instantly takes the pain away it's like

308.88 --> 313.28
i've never experienced

310.16 --> 315.36
anything like that but

313.28 --> 318.4
it doesn't stay away though but it is

315.36 --> 318.40000000000003
like an acute

319.52 --> 323.44
yeah remedy against the acute pain which

322.0 --> 325.759
is very effective

323.44 --> 327.12
never knew that and like it keeps

325.759 --> 330.24
working right but yeah

327.12 --> 333.44
after that it'll still come back

330.24 --> 335.44
kind of slowly but like for that acute

333.44 --> 337.36
shock moment yeah it seems to work

335.44 --> 338.71999999999997
really well i wonder how well it also

337.36 --> 342.40000000000003
works

338.72 --> 344.8
with other other people

342.4 --> 346.71999999999997
like if you have a cavity and it really

344.8 --> 349.36
hurts would it work on that because

346.72 --> 349.91900000000004
that's not what this is right it's in my

349.36 --> 352.08000000000004
jaw

349.919 --> 353.12
but it is those nerves so i really

352.08 --> 358.08
wonder

353.12 --> 358.08
right uh

360.8 --> 367.44
bottles with magnesium was out of stock

364.84 --> 371.19899999999996
really bottles

367.44 --> 371.199
oh this is just like

373.199 --> 380.08000000000004
it's not really a bottle i think they

376.24 --> 384.16
generally come in these things

380.08 --> 388.15999999999997
just basic flat jars with powder in them

384.16 --> 392.08000000000004
i don't know about bottles

388.16 --> 392.08000000000004
with liquid form of that i don't know

392.479 --> 396.56
but it's really cheap too you know so

399.759 --> 404.24
is it a remedy for pain in the whole

401.919 --> 404.24
body

404.479 --> 410.08
well the thing is i

407.84 --> 412.0
this is a newly discovered thing like

410.08 --> 413.35999999999996
i've never known that before and i've

412.0 --> 415.919
had this sort of [ __ ]

413.36 --> 417.039
like throughout my life periodically a

415.919 --> 419.84
lot of it

417.039 --> 421.52
even during the flat earth early bird

419.84 --> 424.08
shows

421.52 --> 426.15999999999997
once or twice a year and i just i'm kind

424.08 --> 428.479
of open about it i deal with it

426.16 --> 430.47900000000004
but i never knew this right i don't know

428.479 --> 433.75899999999996
if it works for other things as well

430.479 --> 436.96
maybe if there is an acute like sharp

433.759 --> 439.52000000000004
moment of pain that's what it

436.96 --> 440.71999999999997
like with this situation seems to work

439.52 --> 443.35999999999996
really well for so

440.72 --> 445.59900000000005
maybe it also does for other types of

443.36 --> 448.319
shock pain moments

445.599 --> 451.039
i can't say it's really like a long-term

448.319 --> 453.44
pain suppressor

451.039 --> 455.919
from what i've experienced recently

453.44 --> 456.56
right so it's not like a real painkiller

455.919 --> 458.56
but it does

456.56 --> 459.599
seem to work against the pain shock

458.56 --> 462.8
moments

459.599 --> 463.68
in this location don't know if it will

462.8 --> 467.599
do that

463.68 --> 470.08
anywhere else so i don't know maybe you

467.599 --> 472.08
could try it out you know

470.08 --> 476.08
magnesium it's not bad for you as long

472.08 --> 476.08
as you don't like over scoop it

476.24 --> 479.84000000000003
don't don't swallow

480.08 --> 483.919
a handful of powder or something crazy

482.16 --> 486.56
like that

483.919 --> 487.84
but yeah you could try it who knows what

486.56 --> 491.28000000000003
it'll work on

487.84 --> 493.67999999999995
i never knew this maybe also yeah maybe

491.28 --> 494.55999999999995
it is kind of unique to this condition

493.68 --> 497.52
that i have

494.56 --> 498.96
and it doesn't work on other types of

497.52 --> 500.96
pain conditions like that

498.96 --> 503.599
so can guarantee it this is just

500.96 --> 506.71999999999997
something i recently discovered

503.599 --> 509.919
and like really my surprise

506.72 --> 509.91900000000004
i didn't expect that

514.0 --> 521.44
right but besides this little thing

518.64 --> 523.36
that seems to work magnesium is also

521.44 --> 527.12
just

523.36 --> 531.36
it smoothens you out it calms you down

527.12 --> 533.519
and it kind of stabilizes

531.36 --> 534.88
your sense of confidence as a side

533.519 --> 537.2
effect

534.88 --> 538.399
right it's like even alex jones

537.2 --> 540.399
recognizes this

538.399 --> 542.48
in his advertisement for his product

540.399 --> 543.36
because yeah the magnesium is like this

542.48 --> 545.6
overlooked

543.36 --> 545.6
thing

546.959 --> 550.0
it's kind of taken for granted or

548.64 --> 551.8389999999999
something so it

550.0 --> 554.08
hadn't been getting a lot of attention

551.839 --> 556.48
by myself included although i did

554.08 --> 557.44
i have some contact with it again the

556.48 --> 559.839
skin

557.44 --> 561.7600000000001
thing in the past and that worked back

559.839 --> 564.5600000000001
then but even after that i kind of

561.76 --> 564.56
forgot about it

567.519 --> 569.76
right

570.56 --> 573.5189999999999
hello ben white

573.839 --> 582.48
and seeking star water good to see you

577.6 --> 582.48
all right so let's do the t test again

586.8 --> 591.12
i discovered that it mostly has to do

588.88 --> 592.399
with the temperature

591.12 --> 595.04
there is a lot of temperature

592.399 --> 597.6
sensitivity especially to heat

595.04 --> 598.959
cold also but not as much as the heat

597.6 --> 601.36
the heat really does

598.959 --> 602.4799999999999
i don't know just changes the pressure

601.36 --> 607.2
dynamics in the

602.48 --> 607.2
in the osmosis or something right

611.44 --> 618.8800000000001
it's great for many reasons and an

614.0 --> 621.76
average diet is lacking

618.88 --> 633.8389999999999
what you mean in average diet it's

621.76 --> 633.8389999999999
lacking could be

641.92 --> 645.1999999999999
okay good servant yeah that wow that

644.48 --> 648.9590000000001
does sound

645.2 --> 648.9590000000001
like kind of ridiculous

649.12 --> 652.399
planet made of diamond

652.48 --> 655.839
one that is glass and

656.959 --> 663.92
hot ice what

660.8 --> 663.92
how does that even work

671.279 --> 677.68
take all 12 cell salts regularly oh

675.44 --> 677.6800000000001
okay

682.079 --> 685.3599999999999
why don't people understand how dumb

683.76 --> 688.0
that sounds well because

685.36 --> 688.8000000000001
if you buy the heliocentrism and the

688.0 --> 693.12
sources

688.8 --> 697.4399999999999
that provide it then you're used to it

693.12 --> 700.079
you're you you get used to like

697.44 --> 703.2790000000001
they're being very flexible let's just

700.079 --> 706.56
call it flexible in the mind right

703.279 --> 709.36
so there it's easier than to suspend

706.56 --> 711.4399999999999
your disbelief even if if it actually

709.36 --> 712.88
is stupid because if it sounds

711.44 --> 716.24
contradicting and stupid

712.88 --> 720.0
illogical it could just be seen as a

716.24 --> 720.0
challenge as to figure out why

721.519 --> 728.639
how would that work but a hot eye

725.519 --> 730.079
sounds really ridiculous it's like i

728.639 --> 733.519
can't imagine a way how

730.079 --> 735.68
ice could be kept in the ice in the icy

733.519 --> 737.44
state

735.68 --> 739.3599999999999
under high temperature like how would

737.44 --> 741.6800000000001
that ever be possible that seems

739.36 --> 746.0
completely impossible

741.68 --> 749.4399999999999
right because example you could keep

746.0 --> 752.32
water liquid

749.44 --> 754.24
theoretically under extremely cold

752.32 --> 757.839
conditions you know why because

754.24 --> 758.399
ice is expanded water and if the water

757.839 --> 761.839
is

758.399 --> 764.48
visib like physiologically or physically

761.839 --> 765.7600000000001
completely unable to escape because it's

764.48 --> 768.88
perfectly

765.76 --> 771.279
pressurized sealed like perfectly sealed

768.88 --> 772.079
then it simply cannot expand in order to

771.279 --> 774.72
crystallize

772.079 --> 776.2399999999999
into the ice despite the temperature

774.72 --> 778.88
super cold water right so

776.24 --> 779.839
that would be something that could

778.88 --> 782.32
somehow be

779.839 --> 783.12
said oh unique situation because of the

782.32 --> 784.72
pressure there's

783.12 --> 786.32
water even though it's really cool blah

784.72 --> 789.839
blah blah you know

786.32 --> 794.88
cosmogeny heliocentric stories

789.839 --> 798.32
but hot ice there is no condition

794.88 --> 798.8
under which water could be prevented

798.32 --> 802.399
from

798.8 --> 806.0
melting if the temperature was high

802.399 --> 807.36
right that part is under any and

806.0 --> 810.399
visualized

807.36 --> 812.5600000000001
setup completely impossible

810.399 --> 815.76
there's no reason for it ever to not

812.56 --> 818.0
melt makes no sense

815.76 --> 819.4399999999999
right because oh yeah it'll shrink well

818.0 --> 822.56
that's no problem

819.44 --> 824.639
if it's completely sealed then simply

822.56 --> 825.92
it will shrink into water and then

824.639 --> 828.16
perhaps fill the rest

825.92 --> 829.519
up with the lacking pressure with water

828.16 --> 833.279
vapor

829.519 --> 835.839
situation resolved right so

833.279 --> 837.92
it cannot be prevented from melting if

835.839 --> 839.6
the temperature is low under pretty much

837.92 --> 843.199
any circumstance that i can

839.6 --> 846.8000000000001
that i can envision so yes

843.199 --> 849.8389999999999
i agree good servant it is

846.8 --> 851.68
insulting but maybe

849.839 --> 853.7600000000001
you could just see it as a challenge

851.68 --> 856.88
maybe it is their

853.76 --> 859.519
kind of people that'll get into it for

856.88 --> 862.079
them to figure it out

859.519 --> 863.68
to realize that like no that is really

862.079 --> 871.279
impossible

863.68 --> 884.8
you know

871.279 --> 887.199
in a vacuum

884.8 --> 889.3599999999999
a thousand plus earth a sure well if

887.199 --> 889.92
there's billions and billions of things

889.36 --> 892.88
out there

889.92 --> 895.76
then why not right it's not that hard

892.88 --> 895.76
hard to imagine

897.12 --> 913.839
if you believe there's such a thing as

900.0 --> 913.839
more than earth

924.839 --> 927.839
oh

931.199 --> 955.8389999999999
hey steamy traveler

940.88 --> 955.8389999999999
what's that

963.92 --> 969.8389999999999
super ionic eyes

967.199 --> 969.8389999999999
what

973.6 --> 983.839
the [ __ ]

994.839 --> 1001.839
what both solid and liquid

998.959 --> 1001.8389999999999
the hell is this

1005.92 --> 1011.8389999999999
super ionic phase

1022.839 --> 1027.52
what

1025.28 --> 1031.12
is there any kind of video demonstration

1027.52 --> 1031.12
of this process this seems

1032.88 --> 1035.679
interesting

1036.72 --> 1039.839
where's the proof

1041.679 --> 1045.3600000000001
like where's the empirical proof

1047.199 --> 1050.64
there's an extensive description even

1050.0 --> 1054.4
yeah

1050.64 --> 1056.72
of what it was but

1054.4 --> 1056.72
where

1057.52 --> 1064.559
where's the actual experimental

1061.44 --> 1067.8400000000001
like video data to to show

1064.559 --> 1067.84
the state

1078.84 --> 1081.84
weird

1085.52 --> 1091.9189999999999
yes i read that adamikin indeed

1089.039 --> 1091.919
welcome to jet

1092.72 --> 1098.24
so okay i get i get the description but

1098.4 --> 1105.039
how do they know this right where

1102.4 --> 1105.039
how is this

1105.44 --> 1113.28
figured out how did they detect it

1108.799 --> 1113.28
hello amanda young what troll oh

1117.33 --> 1121.12
[Music]

1118.88 --> 1124.64
you take a class and learn some math

1121.12 --> 1127.76
dude i had math and physics

1124.64 --> 1131.039
yeah i was pretty good at it

1127.76 --> 1133.6
in school nick rupert i'm pretty good at

1131.039 --> 1134.48
math and physics it's just that i've

1133.6 --> 1136.6399999999999
kind of

1134.48 --> 1138.96
abandoned math because it tends to give

1136.64 --> 1141.44
me a headache and people

1138.96 --> 1142.4
that are into it maneuver you into just

1141.44 --> 1145.28
some freaking

1142.4 --> 1146.48
number pattern loop which is extremely

1145.28 --> 1149.6
distracting from

1146.48 --> 1153.2
actual oversight over how things work

1149.6 --> 1156.3999999999999
so i try to avoid it and instead look at

1153.2 --> 1158.64
math as to what is the pattern

1156.4 --> 1160.0800000000002
that just what is the pattern what is it

1158.64 --> 1162.8400000000001
standing for what is it

1160.08 --> 1164.8799999999999
representing right because math is

1162.84 --> 1167.52
representation

1164.88 --> 1169.6000000000001
that's what i look at i don't look at

1167.52 --> 1169.9189999999999
the actual mechanics of the numbers i

1169.6 --> 1172.08
look

1169.919 --> 1173.679
at the patterns of the graphs i look at

1172.08 --> 1178.08
the consistent

1173.679 --> 1180.0800000000002
effects existential effects so

1178.08 --> 1183.6
that's what i do with it right so i

1180.08 --> 1185.76
don't like to talk about math

1183.6 --> 1187.12
but i am pretty good at math because i

1185.76 --> 1188.72
understand math right

1187.12 --> 1190.7199999999998
it's kind of like programming i

1188.72 --> 1192.48
understand programming i don't know how

1190.72 --> 1193.52
to program but i freaking will

1192.48 --> 1196.799
understand it

1193.52 --> 1198.48
and i've proved that proven that to

1196.799 --> 1199.12
people that know how to program by

1198.48 --> 1202.48
giving them

1199.12 --> 1207.52
like in-depth like detailed device

1202.48 --> 1210.64
advice like giving them recommendations

1207.52 --> 1214.08
within something that they're doing

1210.64 --> 1218.64
that's i can do that

1214.08 --> 1222.24
right it's worked out quite a few times

1218.64 --> 1222.24
in the past though but

1223.2 --> 1229.919
uh it's a long time ago

1226.559 --> 1232.0
i used to do that all the time or i

1229.919 --> 1235.919
wanted to do that all the time and i got

1232.0 --> 1238.72
a few opportunities to kind of help out

1235.919 --> 1238.72
with ideas

1241.919 --> 1247.1200000000001
how are you gonna know what the

1244.799 --> 1248.799
predictions of an experiment or theory

1247.12 --> 1252.32
are when you can't do math

1248.799 --> 1252.8799999999999
oh [ __ ] rupert you don't really seem

1252.32 --> 1255.76
to

1252.88 --> 1258.0
understand the scientific method you see

1255.76 --> 1261.12
scientific method doesn't require

1258.0 --> 1266.0
math it just requires you

1261.12 --> 1270.2399999999998
to describe the cause of the effect

1266.0 --> 1273.76
yeah so it shows you the the patterns

1270.24 --> 1275.6
you don't need to insert any numbers

1273.76 --> 1277.44
because all you have to basically

1275.6 --> 1281.12
explain

1277.44 --> 1283.52
is what is changing

1281.12 --> 1284.7199999999998
right it's not even about how it is like

1283.52 --> 1288.559
what

1284.72 --> 1291.52
are you changing to change an effect

1288.559 --> 1292.72
because of an effect so it's only about

1291.52 --> 1295.52
non-change

1292.72 --> 1296.48
and change right it has nothing to do

1295.52 --> 1298.799
with any

1296.48 --> 1300.32
numerical thing you don't have to

1298.799 --> 1302.08
involve numerics in it

1300.32 --> 1303.52
right math is not required in the

1302.08 --> 1305.6
scientific method only

1303.52 --> 1309.12
thing you have to establish is whether

1305.6 --> 1309.12
something is changed

1309.44 --> 1316.8400000000001
yeah so i'm sorry nick rupert

1314.559 --> 1318.799
maybe you should go to the doctor

1316.84 --> 1320.8799999999999
because

1318.799 --> 1323.28
you see or well another type of dog do

1320.88 --> 1327.679
you seem to have some mental problems

1323.28 --> 1327.6789999999999
a little bit of methyl methaholics

1329.52 --> 1334.559
math is like kryptonite for oh god keep

1332.799 --> 1337.52
gaslighting yourself buddies

1334.559 --> 1337.52
keep gaslighting

1341.679 --> 1350.24
right maybe you should focus a little

1345.12 --> 1350.2399999999998
less on math and more on spelling

1358.84 --> 1361.84
right

1362.48 --> 1365.52
right and adam yeah good servant you're

1364.799 --> 1368.72
totally on

1365.52 --> 1371.76
yeah adam if he chooses to

1368.72 --> 1374.08
he can absolutely mask the

1371.76 --> 1375.6
[ __ ] out of anybody anybody i know

1374.08 --> 1379.76
pretty much

1375.6 --> 1382.32
because he has the focus i'm not

1379.76 --> 1383.44
i'd like to basically just show the

1382.32 --> 1386.0
patterns right

1383.44 --> 1387.1200000000001
to bypass the math he can actually do

1386.0 --> 1390.24
the math

1387.12 --> 1390.2399999999998
if he chooses to

1390.799 --> 1394.799
because yeah he's not just going to do

1392.48 --> 1396.08
all that if it's just a bunch of

1394.799 --> 1400.0
squirting globers that

1396.08 --> 1400.0
aren't really listening anyway

1400.4 --> 1405.52
right there has to be a proper receiver

1403.679 --> 1407.1200000000001
for the teaching in order for him to

1405.52 --> 1407.76
engage because he's not going to waste

1407.12 --> 1411.52
his

1407.76 --> 1417.84
quality thinking

1411.52 --> 1417.84
on just some random chat trolls

1420.159 --> 1427.3600000000001
oh wow yeah

1423.84 --> 1428.8799999999999
dan 52 dislikes somebody's having a bad

1427.36 --> 1432.24
mood today

1428.88 --> 1435.44
very bad mood this is terrible

1432.24 --> 1435.44
what did i do wrong

1436.64 --> 1445.8400000000001
like serious what did i do wrong

1446.96 --> 1451.6000000000001
this is weird man it almost seems like

1450.88 --> 1455.2
the more

1451.6 --> 1458.24
i am trying to stabilize

1455.2 --> 1459.279
relations between the globe and flat

1458.24 --> 1462.4
earth and i

1459.279 --> 1465.44
try to be reasonably defensive of

1462.4 --> 1466.96
globe things like providing

1465.44 --> 1469.1200000000001
like looking at it like oh it's a

1466.96 --> 1471.6000000000001
learning opportunity even from within

1469.12 --> 1473.4399999999998
the the people that don't know right

1471.6 --> 1476.8799999999999
just

1473.44 --> 1480.48
fractal thinking defending and yeah

1476.88 --> 1487.8400000000001
ballers seem to maybe i unnerve them or

1480.48 --> 1487.84
something when i do that

1490.48 --> 1493.2
it's weird

1493.679 --> 1501.8400000000001
58 somebody's in a really bad mood today

1507.52 --> 1512.6399999999999
oh nick did you just double down say the

1509.679 --> 1515.279
same thing over again

1512.64 --> 1516.48
if you can do math you will have no way

1515.279 --> 1518.799
to know

1516.48 --> 1519.679
whether your experiment falsifies your

1518.799 --> 1522.96
theory or not

1519.679 --> 1526.48
no you don't you don't need

1522.96 --> 1528.64
math you just need to know if the thing

1526.48 --> 1529.279
you're varying and manipulating is

1528.64 --> 1532.0800000000002
causing

1529.279 --> 1533.919
the effect of the hypothesis you don't

1532.08 --> 1536.6399999999999
need any math for that i'm so

1533.919 --> 1536.64
sorry nick

1538.0 --> 1544.32
your math is superfluous it it's not

1541.2 --> 1546.559
foundational math is not the foundation

1544.32 --> 1550.1589999999999
of reality

1546.559 --> 1554.72
it's a side effect it's a it's a tool

1550.159 --> 1557.8400000000001
to compare structures

1554.72 --> 1557.84
and to get precise

1558.0 --> 1563.52
right in modeling but it's it's always

1568.84 --> 1571.84
secondary

1580.24 --> 1585.84
god what

1583.52 --> 1588.0
sounds like mental yeah you sound

1585.84 --> 1590.1589999999999
absolutely like you're mentally ill nick

1588.0 --> 1594.48
rupert

1590.159 --> 1598.7990000000002
it sounds like you're crying out

1594.48 --> 1602.799
for math for math to mean something

1598.799 --> 1605.279
what did you sacrifice for your math

1602.799 --> 1606.8799999999999
what did you do that you have to put it

1605.279 --> 1610.0
on a pedestal to become

1606.88 --> 1611.279
ever important because it isn't it's

1610.0 --> 1613.12
just a tool

1611.279 --> 1615.919
seems like you're worshiping the tool

1613.12 --> 1618.799
you think that the tool is the reality

1615.919 --> 1618.7990000000002
it's really sad

1618.96 --> 1622.64
but at the same time kind of funny

1623.12 --> 1628.1589999999999
oh can you please describe what you mean

1625.039 --> 1628.1589999999999
by fractal thinking

1631.2 --> 1634.72
that's not an easy way to just describe

1633.679 --> 1638.0800000000002
it it's

1634.72 --> 1638.08
fractal thinking is

1638.96 --> 1646.0
comes from like realization

1642.64 --> 1648.3200000000002
that there's different ways of thinking

1646.0 --> 1650.64
from everybody and then everybody is

1648.32 --> 1654.0
basically going through their own linear

1650.64 --> 1654.64
experiences with their own swings and

1654.0 --> 1657.679
their own

1654.64 --> 1659.1200000000001
inner responses to whatever information

1657.679 --> 1662.64
they are being confronted with

1659.12 --> 1665.76
at the time just like well we are as

1662.64 --> 1668.88
individuals right

1665.76 --> 1673.36
and if you realize that then

1668.88 --> 1673.3600000000001
you can just figure out

1674.0 --> 1678.0
whenever you say something what the

1676.32 --> 1679.9189999999999
effect of it is going to be

1678.0 --> 1682.0
to different people in different states

1679.919 --> 1683.5200000000002
of mind based on cross-referencing with

1682.0 --> 1685.12
everything you've been confronted with

1683.52 --> 1686.72
you start to figure out how do people

1685.12 --> 1689.9189999999999
respond

1686.72 --> 1694.08
universally on the spectrum

1689.919 --> 1696.24
of moods and character types and then

1694.08 --> 1698.08
well then you can try to basically

1696.24 --> 1700.0
figure out okay if i'm going to bring

1698.08 --> 1700.8799999999999
forth a subject if we're going to make a

1700.0 --> 1703.84
statement

1700.88 --> 1704.88
how is that going to affect every single

1703.84 --> 1707.6789999999999
one

1704.88 --> 1709.279
every single position on the spectrum

1707.679 --> 1712.159
and sometimes

1709.279 --> 1713.12
just by considering that you start to

1712.159 --> 1715.5200000000002
see

1713.12 --> 1717.1999999999998
whole things that can come from with it

1715.52 --> 1720.399
and then you can see like a true

1717.2 --> 1720.3990000000001
long-term influence

1721.2 --> 1725.44
of just words or statements or an

1724.32 --> 1728.799
attitude

1725.44 --> 1728.799
or principles

1729.76 --> 1736.8799999999999
and communicating them and that's

1733.36 --> 1739.1999999999998
yeah that's what i call fractal thinking

1736.88 --> 1739.919
because when you apply fractal thinking

1739.2 --> 1741.3600000000001
you take it

1739.919 --> 1744.72
yeah depending on how far you're gonna

1741.36 --> 1747.12
take it how far you can

1744.72 --> 1748.32
basically suspend your disbelief to try

1747.12 --> 1750.9599999999998
to emulate

1748.32 --> 1751.6789999999999
people in other situations and mindsets

1750.96 --> 1755.2
which can be

1751.679 --> 1756.88
very strenuous like to really imagine

1755.2 --> 1758.72
what it is to be somebody that's

1756.88 --> 1761.8400000000001
completely

1758.72 --> 1764.08
surrendered to evil is very strenuous

1761.84 --> 1766.6399999999999
or somebody that's like completely

1764.08 --> 1770.559
delusional is very strenuous

1766.64 --> 1774.5590000000002
but if you can get used to it

1770.559 --> 1776.399
then suddenly you really start to get it

1774.559 --> 1778.32
you really understand and can even

1776.399 --> 1781.279
predict what people will do

1778.32 --> 1782.24
based on the state they're in in

1781.279 --> 1786.0
relation to

1782.24 --> 1788.24
what their character ability ranges

1786.0 --> 1788.24
right

1790.96 --> 1798.3990000000001
what did he say word salad

1794.32 --> 1801.039
biker don't talk to ladies like that

1798.399 --> 1801.039
nick rupert

1804.48 --> 1809.84
seems like nick is in a bit of a squirt

1806.84 --> 1809.84
fest

1819.76 --> 1822.96
right but i hope that explains fractal

1821.919 --> 1824.5590000000002
thinking again i

1822.96 --> 1826.96
like every time i try to keep it as

1824.559 --> 1829.9189999999999
short as possible

1826.96 --> 1830.64
because the entire problem with fractal

1829.919 --> 1834.159
thinking

1830.64 --> 1834.88
is this is the main problem of engaging

1834.159 --> 1837.2
in it

1834.88 --> 1840.7990000000002
that when you go into another mindset

1837.2 --> 1844.24
and truly start to figure it out

1840.799 --> 1847.36
you can accidentally personify

1844.24 --> 1850.24
your own identity with it

1847.36 --> 1851.36
and then you can get stuck right it's

1850.24 --> 1853.84
almost like

1851.36 --> 1856.0
you accidentally become possessed this

1853.84 --> 1856.8799999999999
is by the way part of the mechanics even

1856.0 --> 1859.84
of possession

1856.88 --> 1860.64
is you get obsessed with something and

1859.84 --> 1864.24
then you

1860.64 --> 1867.519
change because of it right well

1864.24 --> 1870.32
fractal thinking if you really

1867.519 --> 1872.32
go far away from what you would want to

1870.32 --> 1873.12
consider what you want to know is out

1872.32 --> 1875.12
there

1873.12 --> 1877.039
and you start to deep dig into the

1875.12 --> 1880.1589999999999
darkness or heavy delusion

1877.039 --> 1883.6
ironman lucifer then they

1880.159 --> 1883.6000000000001
can basically

1884.08 --> 1889.9189999999999
it can come too close you might

1887.2 --> 1890.799
become too sympathetic in the process

1889.919 --> 1894.0
accidentally

1890.799 --> 1894.559
and then it kind of rubs off on you and

1894.0 --> 1897.76
you might

1894.559 --> 1901.279
get stuck into elements right

1897.76 --> 1905.12
this is even like very dark people

1901.279 --> 1907.519
are very paranoid and aggressive

1905.12 --> 1908.9599999999998
you might get an idea from that

1907.519 --> 1912.0
perspective that will get

1908.96 --> 1913.039
stuck to you and you might attain that

1912.0 --> 1915.44
paranoia

1913.039 --> 1917.279
that's not you're not supposed to have

1915.44 --> 1919.519
that as a really good person that's

1917.279 --> 1920.08
really careful not to offend anybody and

1919.519 --> 1922.96
that's really

1920.08 --> 1923.6
careful in picking their life routes but

1922.96 --> 1927.039
just by

1923.6 --> 1930.1589999999999
imagining somebody that is messed up

1927.039 --> 1933.84
it might accidentally catch

1930.159 --> 1936.64
you and you might get a like temporary

1933.84 --> 1937.12
sense of paranoia or a fair idea that

1936.64 --> 1939.3600000000001
stuck

1937.12 --> 1941.76
get that that gets stuck it's also part

1939.36 --> 1946.1589999999999
of slovania syndrome

1941.76 --> 1948.32
right and this is even

1946.159 --> 1949.44
in the mechanics of my healer he

1948.32 --> 1951.519
describes this

1949.44 --> 1952.88
yeah that it's basically what i just

1951.519 --> 1954.88
said

1952.88 --> 1956.48
only i gave it a more psychological

1954.88 --> 1959.7600000000002
context and he

1956.48 --> 1963.84
describes it more as just yeah

1959.76 --> 1963.84
ariman and lucifer

1964.96 --> 1969.76
right so spirit mechanics is also part

1968.159 --> 1973.919
of the whole thing

1969.76 --> 1978.399
the spirit mechanics really kind of

1973.919 --> 1978.3990000000001
is a critical part of fractal thinking

1979.2 --> 1982.48
like if you don't accept any kind of

1981.2 --> 1984.72
spirit mechanics

1982.48 --> 1985.6
then you're just not going to understand

1984.72 --> 1987.559
it at all

1985.6 --> 1989.279
you won't understand the the

1987.559 --> 1991.6
hyperdynamics the

1989.279 --> 1992.399
the fractal dynamics because of it

1991.6 --> 1996.6399999999999
because you don't

1992.399 --> 2000.399
understand that spirit really is a thing

1996.64 --> 2003.6000000000001
and has a determining factor in how

2000.399 --> 2004.7199999999998
things and people respond get put

2003.6 --> 2008.08
together

2004.72 --> 2009.919
unfold into certain types of situations

2008.08 --> 2012.399
they're going to bump into

2009.919 --> 2013.279
right you know don't necessarily can use

2012.399 --> 2016.32
it to predict

2013.279 --> 2017.039
specifically but you can get a general

2016.32 --> 2019.4399999999998
notion of

2017.039 --> 2020.24
like okay you're gonna wake up in this

2019.44 --> 2022.3990000000001
mood

2020.24 --> 2023.76
then typically these type of things can

2022.399 --> 2025.76
come from that

2023.76 --> 2028.32
or you woke up in another type of mood

2025.76 --> 2030.559
and then you already know

2028.32 --> 2032.799
like this is where you wanna go this is

2030.559 --> 2035.44
what's gonna happen

2032.799 --> 2035.9189999999999
and then usually a big part of it does

2035.44 --> 2039.919
happen

2035.919 --> 2042.5590000000002
or you simply

2039.919 --> 2045.3600000000001
are so into it that the things that

2042.559 --> 2047.6
would contradict that slightly or

2045.36 --> 2049.04
other things that might have happened if

2047.6 --> 2050.0789999999997
you weren't in that mood they're just

2049.04 --> 2052.56
gonna bounce off

2050.079 --> 2053.2000000000003
because you're so into that frequency

2052.56 --> 2056.879
and then i think

2053.2 --> 2059.1189999999997
bounce off dark dark intentions dark

2056.879 --> 2060.0789999999997
tendencies they might have something

2059.119 --> 2062.8790000000004
planned to try

2060.079 --> 2063.28
it out to get here or something it'll

2062.879 --> 2065.679
just

2063.28 --> 2066.639
bounce off because that spirit energy is

2065.679 --> 2069.76
very strong

2066.639 --> 2071.9190000000003
in that moment in in such a day right

2069.76 --> 2075.28
this is all spirit mechanics

2071.919 --> 2077.679
and how that actually affects

2075.28 --> 2080.8
how things transpire around you and

2077.679 --> 2085.04
social interactions

2080.8 --> 2085.04
yeah it's all part of fractal thinking

2085.44 --> 2089.52
and i don't blame you if you think it's

2087.76 --> 2092.2400000000002
all convoluted because it

2089.52 --> 2092.24
it it's

2092.56 --> 2099.119
it's just everything

2095.839 --> 2102.7999999999997
so oversight on everything

2099.119 --> 2105.52
every field

2102.8 --> 2107.76
and also my approach in the learning

2105.52 --> 2111.839
process is just

2107.76 --> 2113.6800000000003
take all the information even if entire

2111.839 --> 2115.92
fields might be competing or

2113.68 --> 2117.04
contradicting have had their wars in the

2115.92 --> 2119.359
past

2117.04 --> 2120.8
i try to look beyond that and just see

2119.359 --> 2124.88
it as

2120.8 --> 2127.44
different expressions of the same

2124.88 --> 2129.359
attempts the same feelings the same

2127.44 --> 2132.48
spirit

2129.359 --> 2133.44
and then different crystallizations of

2132.48 --> 2136.16
them

2133.44 --> 2138.2400000000002
so i always go and look for well very

2136.16 --> 2139.04
specific frequency and very specific

2138.24 --> 2142.3999999999996
patterns and

2139.04 --> 2145.2
guess what jesus

2142.4 --> 2146.8
everything that has to do with him of

2145.2 --> 2149.4399999999996
what he actually did

2146.8 --> 2149.8390000000004
and said yeah that's one of like the

2149.44 --> 2153.839
most

2149.839 --> 2156.88
optimal crystallizations

2153.839 --> 2158.16
of purity intentions godly intentions

2156.88 --> 2160.1600000000003
the good

2158.16 --> 2162.96
that i've ever come across right to tie

2160.16 --> 2162.96
it all in with that

2166.32 --> 2174.48
am i chanting a spell with my hands now

2169.68 --> 2174.48
the hands are just support

2176.48 --> 2187.839
it's kind of to i don't know

2180.0 --> 2187.839
i do it purely intuitive

2187.92 --> 2194.16
you know when i get ethereal

2191.28 --> 2196.96
and talk about like frequency fields out

2194.16 --> 2200.0789999999997
there yeah i might typically do this

2196.96 --> 2202.32
because it is like it's

2200.079 --> 2203.44
it's like this field and it's everywhere

2202.32 --> 2206.88
it's like

2203.44 --> 2210.48
it's not bound by space even

2206.88 --> 2214.32
like it's it's everywhere

2210.48 --> 2217.359
right just like the possibility

2214.32 --> 2220.6400000000003
to interface with god

2217.359 --> 2224.0
is everywhere it's everywhere

2220.64 --> 2226.56
it's not specifically physically bound

2224.0 --> 2226.56
to any

2226.839 --> 2243.839
location it's just everywhere

2243.92 --> 2246.16
whoa

2252.8 --> 2257.8390000000004
what the

2264.32 --> 2268.7200000000003
yeah sometimes a bit weird sensations

2266.48 --> 2271.44
here still trying to look

2268.72 --> 2273.04
when this sort of thing is going on like

2271.44 --> 2275.599
like even my teeth

2273.04 --> 2277.92
sometimes can just seem to move or

2275.599 --> 2279.599
something it's really freaky

2277.92 --> 2281.119
and then it hurts for a while and then

2279.599 --> 2282.32
after a while i feel back and it's like

2281.119 --> 2285.52
what did this

2282.32 --> 2287.3590000000004
did it just sink for like a millimeter

2285.52 --> 2289.92
or something it doesn't seem to fit like

2287.359 --> 2293.92
it did before that [ __ ]

2289.92 --> 2296.079
yeah weird uh

2293.92 --> 2299.839
yeah seeking star wars they're they're

2296.079 --> 2299.8390000000004
going for a record attempt

2300.079 --> 2305.04
somebody is in a really foul mood today

2303.119 --> 2313.839
but hey i appreciate all the votes you

2305.04 --> 2313.839
know it's great

2336.4 --> 2343.04
right it could also be by the way that

2339.44 --> 2345.119
they don't like or that this person is

2343.04 --> 2348.88
extra pissed off because of my

2345.119 --> 2352.839
uh my ballwin act

2348.88 --> 2354.6400000000003
i have no idea what you guys think about

2352.839 --> 2357.2
it

2354.64 --> 2359.359
like maybe it it's a little unnerving to

2357.2 --> 2359.839
you i would totally get that because it

2359.359 --> 2363.5989999999997
is

2359.839 --> 2366.72
like he is a fanatic right

2363.599 --> 2369.52
he can't be defeated

2366.72 --> 2372.0789999999997
but don't worry he's always going to be

2369.52 --> 2374.64
secondary

2372.079 --> 2376.48
he's me from the past i'm very glad that

2374.64 --> 2379.839
i've outgrown him

2376.48 --> 2379.839
but yeah in a way

2380.839 --> 2386.96
he's he's not gonna really

2383.76 --> 2386.96
lay down because

2387.68 --> 2398.64
yeah it can go on

2396.16 --> 2399.2
yeah nathan are but it's just a sock

2398.64 --> 2401.68
voting

2399.2 --> 2401.68
a lot of it

2406.72 --> 2411.839
okay number six sure

2413.839 --> 2418.319
well i haven't really needed the to talk

2417.119 --> 2420.599
about that

2418.319 --> 2421.7599999999998
but you know since trolls and

2420.599 --> 2425.04
heliocentrical

2421.76 --> 2426.96
religious fanatics are kind of prevalent

2425.04 --> 2429.2
and through my activities on the flat

2426.96 --> 2431.359
earth debates definitely get to know

2429.2 --> 2434.48
about me

2431.359 --> 2439.04
and how i absolutely blatantly

2434.48 --> 2442.4
condone nathan's crushing of globers

2439.04 --> 2444.8
when they get all lying and devious

2442.4 --> 2446.7200000000003
how i absolutely condone that it's only

2444.8 --> 2449.76
to be expected

2446.72 --> 2450.24
that they would at times just come after

2449.76 --> 2453.5200000000004
me

2450.24 --> 2455.4399999999996
right so they're still you don't have to

2453.52 --> 2456.96
the votes in themselves i don't give a

2455.44 --> 2459.04
[ __ ] about that

2456.96 --> 2460.48
it's nonsense most of it gets erased

2459.04 --> 2462.319
anyway you know

2460.48 --> 2464.48
it's not the first time i've had this

2462.319 --> 2467.839
for years it's okay

2464.48 --> 2467.839
it's really okay

2469.04 --> 2473.04
there's still plenty of psychology to

2471.68 --> 2476.24
talk about

2473.04 --> 2479.2799999999997
right most of flat earth for me is

2476.24 --> 2482.319
psychology because

2479.28 --> 2486.2400000000002
i'm a master of cosmogeny i can just

2482.319 --> 2490.88
say that i'm a master

2486.24 --> 2490.8799999999997
it's nothing out there is gonna faze me

2491.119 --> 2496.1600000000003
right you can't outdo me i'm a better

2494.0 --> 2499.68
glober than you are

2496.16 --> 2503.5989999999997
i'm a more honorable glober than you are

2499.68 --> 2507.2799999999997
whoever's trolling you know this

2503.599 --> 2510.079
and yeah i don't

2507.28 --> 2510.48
like you measure my entire value based

2510.079 --> 2514.1600000000003
on

2510.48 --> 2517.2
consensus and income

2514.16 --> 2520.48
right so yeah that hurts

2517.2 --> 2522.64
that hurts because you gave everything

2520.48 --> 2524.48
to be part of this thing and you're

2522.64 --> 2526.16
still incompetent

2524.48 --> 2528.0
you can barely hold on to your own

2526.16 --> 2531.44
faculties and me somebody that

2528.0 --> 2534.88
specifically did not go for these things

2531.44 --> 2539.28
not for the status not for the money

2534.88 --> 2543.28
and i'm better at it in every aspect

2539.28 --> 2545.52
than you all you got is a bunch of maths

2543.28 --> 2547.28
a bunch of specific numbers nonsense and

2545.52 --> 2550.0
then a lot of claim laid to that and

2547.28 --> 2553.28
philosophical garbage

2550.0 --> 2554.24
that's what you got i actually know how

2553.28 --> 2557.44
to do things

2554.24 --> 2560.24
how to visualize how to figure out how

2557.44 --> 2561.28
i know how to figure out how to figure

2560.24 --> 2564.4799999999996
out things

2561.28 --> 2566.5600000000004
really well yeah and that makes me

2564.48 --> 2568.64
a better baller than you because that's

2566.56 --> 2571.44
exactly what the ball religion is

2568.64 --> 2571.44
and i know that

2572.16 --> 2581.5989999999997
yeah isn't it alien napalm

2576.72 --> 2584.56
isn't it it is isn't it it is good one

2581.599 --> 2585.599
i think it's hilarious i'm laughing

2584.56 --> 2588.56
inside myself

2585.599 --> 2589.3590000000004
in a very sadistic way mind you because

2588.56 --> 2591.92
i'm still

2589.359 --> 2593.92
pissed off that the world turned out the

2591.92 --> 2597.76
way it did

2593.92 --> 2601.839
in school figuring out that people

2597.76 --> 2605.5600000000004
that had the same interests as me right

2601.839 --> 2609.359
that they are disgusting bastards

2605.56 --> 2612.56
egotistical ninnies and

2609.359 --> 2613.359
liars and deviants disgusting people a

2612.56 --> 2616.0789999999997
lot of them

2613.359 --> 2617.04
are they turn out to be like that or to

2616.079 --> 2619.28
be weak

2617.04 --> 2620.16
and cocking and that the entire

2619.28 --> 2622.48
apparatus

2620.16 --> 2623.92
actually upholding this level of

2622.48 --> 2626.2400000000002
supposed intelligence

2623.92 --> 2627.44
is corrupted and that's his huge

2626.24 --> 2631.2
disappointment so this

2627.44 --> 2633.599
is my vengeance upon all of you

2631.2 --> 2634.48
all of you that became part of that

2633.599 --> 2637.76
nining

2634.48 --> 2639.839
guild of bullshitters and storytellers

2637.76 --> 2641.3590000000004
that literally tried to make their own

2639.839 --> 2645.599
public [ __ ]

2641.359 --> 2648.7999999999997
this is my revenge on you yeah one man

2645.599 --> 2652.48
one man very poor other

2648.8 --> 2655.599
individuals that are my alike

2652.48 --> 2658.079
we're outdoing you we're breaking every

2655.599 --> 2659.119
stupid little storytelling nonsense

2658.079 --> 2661.2000000000003
trick

2659.119 --> 2662.7200000000003
and we're actually figuring out the real

2661.2 --> 2667.4399999999996
mechanics

2662.72 --> 2667.4399999999996
and even how you could still

2667.599 --> 2671.599
twirl around this is what i do and still

2670.24 --> 2673.2799999999997
make it into a ball

2671.599 --> 2675.3590000000004
up to a certain level of suspense of

2673.28 --> 2678.96
disbelief i can still do that

2675.359 --> 2681.5989999999997
yeah this is my revenge i'm making

2678.96 --> 2682.16
that entire corrupted apparatus of

2681.599 --> 2685.44
teaching

2682.16 --> 2688.64
and guild forming and a bunch of niniang

2685.44 --> 2690.96
whiny [ __ ] that that tried to just

2688.64 --> 2692.319
like oh it's my honor oh i'm gonna

2690.96 --> 2696.56
publish this i'm gonna

2692.319 --> 2699.7599999999998
lawyers and [ __ ] bullshitters stories on

2696.56 --> 2700.64
liberal tv all that crap yeah i'm gonna

2699.76 --> 2703.599
make it all

2700.64 --> 2704.64
completely superfluous we don't even

2703.599 --> 2707.76
need

2704.64 --> 2710.64
that to make the ball religion survive

2707.76 --> 2711.76
there's a better way you are completely

2710.64 --> 2715.2
superfluous

2711.76 --> 2718.2400000000002
outdated and corrupted and you need to

2715.2 --> 2719.2799999999997
get the [ __ ] out of this world and leave

2718.24 --> 2720.9599999999996
it to people that

2719.28 --> 2722.4
actually know what the [ __ ] they're

2720.96 --> 2725.44
doing

2722.4 --> 2725.44
and that have honor

2730.839 --> 2735.92
yeah know

2732.56 --> 2738.319
what reality is and can still fabricate

2735.92 --> 2739.359
the story which is what it is the

2738.319 --> 2743.2
thinking game

2739.359 --> 2746.0
that's what the ball is instead of just

2743.2 --> 2746.64
making everybody [ __ ] and then

2746.0 --> 2748.88
trying to

2746.64 --> 2749.7599999999998
rule over them like a bunch of demon

2748.88 --> 2760.2400000000002
ninis

2749.76 --> 2762.8
it's disgusting

2760.24 --> 2764.0
yeah now that the thing is nick rupert

2762.8 --> 2766.7200000000003
that

2764.0 --> 2767.68
classic projection you don't know what

2766.72 --> 2769.68
you're doing though

2767.68 --> 2771.44
you're just making it up yeah that's

2769.68 --> 2774.48
exactly

2771.44 --> 2776.319
what the heliocentric religion is

2774.48 --> 2778.56
they don't know what they're doing

2776.319 --> 2782.4
they're just making it up

2778.56 --> 2782.4
and they're making it up poorly

2782.48 --> 2789.359
errors in every corner

2786.079 --> 2792.6400000000003
this proof the assertion at

2789.359 --> 2795.2799999999997
every corner in the mechanics

2792.64 --> 2796.4
it's completely broken heliocentric

2795.28 --> 2800.2400000000002
modeling

2796.4 --> 2803.28
is the most broken physics

2800.24 --> 2804.72
conception humanity has ever constructed

2803.28 --> 2808.48
at this point

2804.72 --> 2811.4399999999996
but it's supposed to be that

2808.48 --> 2811.92
because it's a toy it's not actually

2811.44 --> 2815.04
real

2811.92 --> 2817.359
it's actually a tool to challenge your

2815.04 --> 2820.56
consciousness

2817.359 --> 2822.96
yeah you know what globers are

2820.56 --> 2823.68
and trenchers especially they're the

2822.96 --> 2827.119
ones that

2823.68 --> 2830.0789999999997
failed the test they got bound

2827.119 --> 2831.04
by the reversed world spell bound by

2830.079 --> 2833.04
lies

2831.04 --> 2835.2
expressing itself in their behavior as

2833.04 --> 2838.56
well delusion

2835.2 --> 2841.4399999999996
dementia lies because they

2838.56 --> 2842.24
failed the test they failed to see

2841.44 --> 2845.839
through

2842.24 --> 2845.839
the ball

2848.48 --> 2862.19
squirt for me fundies go

2859.06 --> 2862.19
[Music]

2869.359 --> 2874.72
i have a transparent bowl okay sarco

2877.76 --> 2887.8390000000004
hey turret 306.

2889.119 --> 2894.4
what about flat earth what about it

2894.64 --> 2902.24
yeah all visuals

2898.559 --> 2905.3590000000004
all observations all detections

2902.24 --> 2908.4799999999996
prove the earth is flat

2905.359 --> 2914.88
that the orientation of the overall

2908.48 --> 2917.599
surface is quite persistently flat

2914.88 --> 2918.8
yeah geometrical orientation of the

2917.599 --> 2922.559
earth's surface

2918.8 --> 2929.8390000000004
is consistently flat the ui don't have

2922.559 --> 2929.8390000000004
anything against that

2930.319 --> 2933.839
you're just being a baiter well are you

2932.72 --> 2935.839
literally not

2933.839 --> 2938.0789999999997
what you literally ask a question what

2935.839 --> 2940.0789999999997
about flat earth

2938.079 --> 2942.96
and then you're saying you're just being

2940.079 --> 2945.28
a baiter

2942.96 --> 2947.119
how do you even know what's coming out

2945.28 --> 2949.3590000000004
of your mouth or are you still just

2947.119 --> 2951.04
recovering from the devastating

2949.359 --> 2954.48
realization i just roll

2951.04 --> 2958.24
right over you yeah that you don't

2954.48 --> 2960.2400000000002
want to make it make sense out of it

2958.24 --> 2962.0789999999997
you don't want to make sense out of what

2960.24 --> 2965.359
i just said there

2962.079 --> 2968.88
baltards you didn't like it because

2965.359 --> 2970.7999999999997
the truth hurts it makes your delusional

2968.88 --> 2973.6800000000003
behavior exposed

2970.8 --> 2974.6400000000003
for what it is instead of you being okay

2973.68 --> 2977.9199999999996
with it and then

2974.64 --> 2981.2799999999997
proceeding yeah

2977.92 --> 2983.599
so you're now just projecting

2981.28 --> 2985.599
saying i'm just i'm just baiting and

2983.599 --> 2986.7200000000003
just throw i'm the one that's trolling

2985.599 --> 2989.76
you right

2986.72 --> 2992.9599999999996
i'm the one that's trolling you

2989.76 --> 2993.44
you socks in my chat i'm just trolling

2992.96 --> 2996.7200000000003
you

2993.44 --> 2999.92
right on my channel

2996.72 --> 3003.2
where i on camera talk

2999.92 --> 3005.2000000000003
every day everybody knows who i am

3003.2 --> 3007.359
a lot of people know my address and i'm

3005.2 --> 3008.0789999999997
fine with that some even have my phone

3007.359 --> 3010.48
number

3008.079 --> 3011.76
everybody knows who i am but no no i'm

3010.48 --> 3017.119
the one trolling

3011.76 --> 3017.119
you anonymous sock accounts in my chat

3031.599 --> 3035.76
while seeking star wars i wouldn't call

3033.44 --> 3041.839
physics superfluous

3035.76 --> 3041.8390000000004
but there's a lot to be fixed in physics

3046.559 --> 3053.92
math yeah math is kind of superfluous

3050.24 --> 3057.5989999999997
but on the other hand it does it can get

3053.92 --> 3069.2000000000003
very convenient it's a great tool to use

3057.599 --> 3073.6800000000003
but it isn't essential

3069.2 --> 3073.68
now seeking star wars leave him alone

3073.76 --> 3083.8390000000004
i'll take care of him

3088.8 --> 3096.079
i know seeking star wars i know what

3091.2 --> 3097.52
superfluous means

3096.079 --> 3100.4
but i wouldn't call physics

3097.52 --> 3100.4
non-essential

3102.96 --> 3107.44
there's just a lot of mess to clean up

3105.599 --> 3111.839
in physics because it's become very

3107.44 --> 3111.839
convoluted with baller machinations

3115.2 --> 3118.0789999999997
hey clutch bear

3123.68 --> 3128.0
yeah tara 306 yeah but akuma virus is

3127.44 --> 3131.359
just

3128.0 --> 3133.359
inept like him calling himself the

3131.359 --> 3138.7999999999997
mathematician

3133.359 --> 3141.04
is absolutely ridiculous

3138.8 --> 3143.3590000000004
he's just a liar he's not good at math

3141.04 --> 3143.359
at all

3164.839 --> 3167.839
young

3170.24 --> 3181.839
okay yeah go [ __ ] off dude

3190.64 --> 3195.839
yeah i remember that tara 306 it was

3193.04 --> 3195.839
quite ridiculous

3206.0 --> 3209.92
look i don't really care number six it

3208.48 --> 3212.72
could have a

3209.92 --> 3214.319
thousand down votes serious hey dude get

3212.72 --> 3218.0
all the trolls right

3214.319 --> 3221.2
get them all the entire internet let's

3218.0 --> 3224.8
give like like break the system

3221.2 --> 3230.16
give me over 6 million down votes

3224.8 --> 3233.44
go do it see if it's gonna do anything

3230.16 --> 3235.68
come on then you

3233.44 --> 3236.48
you want to show consensus right you

3235.68 --> 3239.68
want to show

3236.48 --> 3243.68
how everybody doesn't like me well

3239.68 --> 3243.68
six million do it

3244.559 --> 3251.3590000000004
go with the six million down votes

3248.079 --> 3253.92
come on what are you are you weak can't

3251.359 --> 3253.92
you do it

3255.52 --> 3261.04
like come on how much effort is that can

3258.4 --> 3264.2400000000002
make a sock account every 10 seconds

3261.04 --> 3266.96
we just do that for like an hour and ask

3264.24 --> 3269.2
like 10 other buddies to do it

3266.96 --> 3279.839
i don't know you could pile on quite a

3269.2 --> 3279.839
few right

3280.559 --> 3288.559
many people don't like me of how i

3283.839 --> 3293.839
act oh how do i act how do i act

3288.559 --> 3293.8390000000004
stanley said how's my acting

3294.559 --> 3299.52
right if hey if you have a complaint

3297.52 --> 3300.96
sure i'll address that you know if

3299.52 --> 3303.52
people actually have

3300.96 --> 3305.28
legitimate complaints about something i

3303.52 --> 3308.559
see that as of an opportunity

3305.28 --> 3309.119
to improve myself that's also why i

3308.559 --> 3311.599
don't just

3309.119 --> 3312.48
outright ban every freaking troll out

3311.599 --> 3314.88
there

3312.48 --> 3317.04
because sometimes by accident they help

3314.88 --> 3319.44
me

3317.04 --> 3320.5589999999997
that's another piece of revenge that i

3319.44 --> 3322.96
like it's like

3320.559 --> 3324.6400000000003
this is you think you think you can do

3322.96 --> 3328.319
something negative to me

3324.64 --> 3328.319
but no you're just gonna help

3333.52 --> 3338.0
you me like the master mate i i don't

3336.079 --> 3342.4
even know what you're talking about dude

3338.0 --> 3342.4
number six maybe you should get over

3346.839 --> 3353.119
that

3349.839 --> 3362.799
oh you got a 1k subs nice well done

3353.119 --> 3366.559
good servant

3362.799 --> 3366.559
tv is acting not irwin

3366.64 --> 3372.72
right well when i say how i'm acting

3370.0 --> 3373.839
right that's like what's wrong with my

3372.72 --> 3378.0789999999997
attitude or my

3373.839 --> 3378.0789999999997
actions rather right

3378.16 --> 3382.5589999999997
because indeed this is not pre-recorded

3380.799 --> 3383.119
acting i don't have a script i don't

3382.559 --> 3386.2400000000002
have a

3383.119 --> 3388.0
i don't even have a plan this is i'm

3386.24 --> 3390.9599999999996
very spontaneous

3388.0 --> 3392.16
and my plan the one that i do have is

3390.96 --> 3395.839
consistent of okay

3392.16 --> 3399.839
just elements put elements together of

3395.839 --> 3399.839
things that i've done or a subject

3402.24 --> 3405.839
that's it

3407.04 --> 3413.839
no topic today just trolls acting up

3410.24 --> 3417.2799999999997
yeah look at that man 167

3413.839 --> 3419.839
it must be a record 68

3417.28 --> 3419.8390000000004
nice

3426.72 --> 3431.839
okay good servant well why would they go

3429.92 --> 3434.0
somewhere they hate because they kind

3431.839 --> 3447.839
can't find any place they love

3434.0 --> 3447.839
that's why right

3452.88 --> 3461.839
who starting to look at ufos

3457.119 --> 3461.839
are they yeah i've heard about that

3466.559 --> 3475.8390000000004
oh i can't look into that link

3486.839 --> 3489.839
ugh

3511.92 --> 3515.92
ufos may be a distraction from

3513.76 --> 3516.88
everything else well yeah in a way it is

3515.92 --> 3520.4
it's part of the

3516.88 --> 3524.319
alien legacy story

3520.4 --> 3526.88
right part of heliocentrism eventually

3524.319 --> 3529.2
so it's kind of like the cultural

3526.88 --> 3531.359
extension of heliocentrism the entire

3529.2 --> 3534.3999999999996
ufo and aliens

3531.359 --> 3536.48
and look ever since like the x-files

3534.4 --> 3537.52
there's been a lot of people waiting for

3536.48 --> 3541.599
this sort of thing

3537.52 --> 3544.64
right so that's going to preoccupy

3541.599 --> 3546.559
the x-files and alien lovers

3544.64 --> 3549.359
i really love to get into that sort of

3546.559 --> 3552.88
thing and it will serve to distract

3549.359 --> 3552.88
that category of people

3553.119 --> 3559.839
yes it will there's probably a lot of

3556.96 --> 3559.839
them

3573.2 --> 3587.839
hey and i'm making what's that

3598.839 --> 3601.839
hmm

3612.839 --> 3615.839
so

3633.2 --> 3639.2799999999997
people are sex yeah they're probably all

3636.48 --> 3639.28
poor and addicted

3640.839 --> 3644.0
squirters

3642.079 --> 3646.2400000000002
these are the same people that go after

3644.0 --> 3648.319
owen benjamin because he makes them feel

3646.24 --> 3651.52
so guilty

3648.319 --> 3653.52
and yeah i do that too to a certain

3651.52 --> 3656.72
degree especially when it comes to the

3653.52 --> 3660.4
heliocentric religion and

3656.72 --> 3663.7599999999998
all these perverts liars

3660.4 --> 3666.2400000000002
pathological people hiding in the

3663.76 --> 3669.5200000000004
heliocentric religion to kind of

3666.24 --> 3670.24
cover up their own faults and sins to

3669.52 --> 3685.839
themselves

3670.24 --> 3685.839
right it's very confronting

3695.28 --> 3699.8390000000004
project bluebeam nah

3718.4 --> 3725.119
i don't think like the project bluebeam

3721.76 --> 3727.8390000000004
well maybe in some way they were grafted

3725.119 --> 3727.839
in but

3728.799 --> 3733.0389999999998
to be fair i can't say anything right

3730.88 --> 3734.799
about it right now i would have to not

3733.039 --> 3736.7990000000004
be in pain

3734.799 --> 3737.92
because that is like a very tough thing

3736.799 --> 3741.839
to

3737.92 --> 3741.839
puzzle over

3750.48 --> 3755.839
he had terror306 he did say that yes

3766.4 --> 3771.28
george sanford not all of it is plasma

3768.72 --> 3771.2799999999997
phenomena

3771.359 --> 3777.44
there's all kinds of ufos right there's

3774.48 --> 3778.16
there's also metal spheres that have

3777.44 --> 3781.119
been

3778.16 --> 3782.5589999999997
filmed just hovering and [ __ ] like

3781.119 --> 3784.7200000000003
they've kind of been designated as

3782.559 --> 3787.44
drones

3784.72 --> 3788.8799999999997
covering metal spheres or like not

3787.44 --> 3793.68
perfect spheres but like

3788.88 --> 3796.96
pill shape like slightly extended

3793.68 --> 3798.72
weird and you have the well the weird

3796.96 --> 3803.28
falling star-like

3798.72 --> 3807.68
ufo lights that do weird [ __ ]

3803.28 --> 3807.6800000000003
and yet so there's all kinds of these

3808.839 --> 3825.839
phenomena

3811.119 --> 3825.839
yes george sanford dude there is so much

3832.72 --> 3836.0
but you never heard of that metal

3834.24 --> 3838.0
spheres

3836.0 --> 3840.72
they're not perfect spheres though but

3838.0 --> 3841.52
like even that was like declassified a

3840.72 --> 3844.0789999999997
whole

3841.52 --> 3846.64
like 10 years ago or something somewhere

3844.079 --> 3846.6400000000003
over there

3846.72 --> 3853.4399999999996
about how there were jets

3849.76 --> 3855.28
that would actually fly and bump into

3853.44 --> 3858.4
these things that would like hover

3855.28 --> 3858.4
parallel to them

3860.0 --> 3864.079
like from yeah military american

3862.88 --> 3868.559
