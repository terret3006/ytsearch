so

97.84 --> 102.32000000000001
today the weather is

100.64 --> 105.119
cloudy

102.32 --> 105.119
kind of windy

105.2 --> 108.56
but it's still pretty warm

109.2 --> 114.56
and yeah yesterday especially yesterday

112.479 --> 118.24
afternoon

114.56 --> 118.24000000000001
and evening it rained a lot

118.56 --> 124.0
but it seemed like a lot of it just

120.96 --> 124.0
evaporated again

124.88 --> 127.36
anyway

127.52 --> 131.44
it's a bit of a gray day but it's still

129.52 --> 133.36
just nice and warm

131.44 --> 136.44
so

133.36 --> 136.44000000000003
all right

144.16 --> 150.0
hello gadget inspector first in chat

147.28 --> 150.0
good to see you

150.4 --> 157.239
it is saturday

152.959 --> 157.239
september 11 2021

158.4 --> 162.0
uh

159.68 --> 162.0
yeah

164.239 --> 170.8
and i'll be doing a

166.64 --> 174.79999999999998
our show today maybe more depends

170.8 --> 174.8
uh hello dusty writer good to see you

176.48 --> 179.64
all right

184.08 --> 186.4
yeah

186.879 --> 190.159
man i had a really late night again last

189.28 --> 193.599
night

190.159 --> 195.2
i tried not to but it's just

193.599 --> 199.83999999999997
it was

195.2 --> 199.83999999999997
tough to turn that damn computer off

200.0 --> 202.239
uh

205.76 --> 210.64
so it might be a little bit

208.08 --> 212.64000000000001
slow today

210.64 --> 216.0
well i don't know maybe it's just this

212.64 --> 217.44
the first half hour

216.0 --> 219.04
uh

217.44 --> 221.2
right so there were a lot of streams

219.04 --> 223.35999999999999
yesterday

221.2 --> 225.92
and even this morning because mitchell

223.36 --> 227.20000000000002
in us from australia had another live

225.92 --> 229.92
stream

227.2 --> 233.04
with david weiss on

229.92 --> 235.92
i happened to be able to catch that live

233.04 --> 235.92
was interesting

238.879 --> 244.64
oh pee brains video on perspective yeah

242.159 --> 247.28
yeah sorry dusty writer but that's

244.64 --> 249.76
it's it's nonsense

247.28 --> 252.959
it's a nice idea but it stems really

249.76 --> 255.519
from the oh the old counter globe model

252.959 --> 257.359
argument

255.519 --> 260.4
because perspective just doesn't apply

257.359 --> 262.24
to any of the celestial bodies

260.4 --> 263.919
at all

262.24 --> 266.56
right because if they would then there

263.919 --> 269.28
would be an angular size

266.56 --> 270.56
i mean angular speed

269.28 --> 273.44
change

270.56 --> 275.199
as the lights go towards the horizon and

273.44 --> 277.68
they don't

275.199 --> 279.91900000000004
the angular speed in relation to the

277.68 --> 282.24
observer is consistent

279.919 --> 285.68
in the apparent rotation of the

282.24 --> 285.68
celestial demisphere

286.56 --> 291.44
so it's just

289.12 --> 293.68
it's a fun idea to consider it's just

291.44 --> 296.8
not true

293.68 --> 299.84000000000003
anyway hello jason brown

296.8 --> 299.84000000000003
gary everest

301.759 --> 307.96000000000004
yeah gary i got some of your emails i

316.96 --> 320.4
i'll just see where this goes

321.68 --> 325.84000000000003
i thought your emails were kind of pushy

323.68 --> 327.68
and

325.84 --> 329.84
not very helpful

327.68 --> 331.759
but we'll see what you supposedly have

329.84 --> 333.67999999999995
to offer

331.759 --> 336.40000000000003
sound a lot like you remarked mark

333.68 --> 336.40000000000003
smiler

336.56 --> 342.0
though you didn't bring up any magnets

338.32 --> 342.0
or anything but yeah we'll see

345.68 --> 351.72
right

347.199 --> 351.72
so also was watching own benjamin

353.84 --> 358.79999999999995
got halfway

355.759 --> 358.8
that's really good

365.28 --> 369.84
yesterday's flat earth debates were also

367.36 --> 369.84000000000003
excellent

372.88 --> 377.44
oh yeah martin luther was doing uh all

375.44 --> 379.52
kinds of conference streams but his

377.44 --> 381.6
connection just as the

379.52 --> 383.44
time passed his connect his internet

381.6 --> 384.8
connection started to just suck more and

383.44 --> 388.16
more so

384.8 --> 390.08
i hope he all recorded it as well

388.16 --> 391.03900000000004
because we barely got to see anything on

390.08 --> 392.639
that

391.039 --> 395.84
but it looked like he had a lot of fun

392.639 --> 395.84000000000003
there with the crowd

410.56 --> 415.44
oh yeah jim bob gmob had several streams

413.44 --> 419.12
yesterday

415.44 --> 419.12
apparently he got into a bit of a

421.199 --> 426.88
an issue with some guy

423.599 --> 426.88
it was hilarious man

427.68 --> 430.479
like

428.639 --> 433.52
apparently some

430.479 --> 436.4
yeah some guy over in california or

433.52 --> 438.639
something got offended by

436.4 --> 441.039
a cartoon jim bob made and then he

438.639 --> 444.08
literally threatened him so

441.039 --> 446.56
jim bob recorded that put that

444.08 --> 449.44
video on his channel

446.56 --> 452.319
then it got removed for copyright by the

449.44 --> 453.36
guy who then made another video

452.319 --> 456.0
claiming

453.36 --> 459.039
he didn't say that

456.0 --> 461.12
so jim bob uploaded that this is just

459.039 --> 464.12
hilarious

461.12 --> 464.12
god

464.24 --> 467.039
so silly

467.84 --> 470.15999999999997
ah

476.639 --> 479.84000000000003
it was really silly

480.4 --> 482.71999999999997
uh

483.12 --> 487.039
right so yeah that's pretty much been my

485.199 --> 489.28000000000003
activities

487.039 --> 492.84
hey steamy traveler

489.28 --> 492.84
good to see you

494.08 --> 498.08
did i see what rent he put on there

498.479 --> 500.87899999999996
what

503.28 --> 506.75899999999996
that's disgusting

507.199 --> 511.84000000000003
what a

509.36 --> 516.24
i don't care dude like he should

511.84 --> 516.24
literally be silenced into oblivion

517.68 --> 521.8389999999999
it's absolutely repulsive

539.76 --> 543.8389999999999
i think that ranty is just trying to use

542.399 --> 546.56
the

543.839 --> 549.44
the ending of the summer period to just

546.56 --> 552.4799999999999
haul in a whole bunch of

549.44 --> 554.9590000000001
discontent and hurt people like like a

552.48 --> 558.6
real grabbler does because that is what

554.959 --> 561.5999999999999
he is that's his methods he is quite a

558.6 --> 564.72
repulsive individual

561.6 --> 567.6
i wonder if most people even see

564.72 --> 567.6
how bad he is

570.32 --> 574.88
ugh

571.92 --> 577.36
anyway probably

574.88 --> 580.72
it's

577.36 --> 580.72
when he says things like that

582.399 --> 586.399
all right so he's just

583.92 --> 588.7199999999999
he's trolling so he's effectively

586.399 --> 591.68
trolling

588.72 --> 593.76
throwing out that line in the hopes that

591.68 --> 594.959
flat earthers will be like oh how dare

593.76 --> 597.12
you

594.959 --> 599.68
get all outraged right because

597.12 --> 599.68
yeah that's

599.839 --> 604.9590000000001
how you reel in people and he's chosen a

603.36 --> 607.519
phase of the year

604.959 --> 609.92
where people will on average bite a lot

607.519 --> 611.6
more in that

609.92 --> 614.24
because they all

611.6 --> 616.48
are ending their vacations

614.24 --> 617.519
i'll have to get back to work and a lot

616.48 --> 619.6800000000001
of people

617.519 --> 621.2
might not be all that happy about that

619.68 --> 624.64
situation

621.2 --> 624.6400000000001
and even location change

624.88 --> 630.48
so yeah they will be more than

627.76 --> 633.519
averagely agitated and will be more

630.48 --> 635.76
likely to start biting

633.519 --> 638.079
in such

635.76 --> 640.0
troll bait videos basically

638.079 --> 644.04
right

640.0 --> 644.04
it's it's really repulsive

648.399 --> 653.519
uh

650.64 --> 657.24
more people watching oh yeah that that

653.519 --> 657.24
that matters everything

668.399 --> 672.56
telling brandon how to run his show

671.36 --> 675.04
dude

672.56 --> 678.0
brandon should just like if he continues

675.04 --> 682.24
doing that brandon should just ban ranty

678.0 --> 682.24
serious just get him out of there

682.8 --> 687.16
you know it's his channel now

689.519 --> 694.0
and i think that brandon's doing fine

692.64 --> 696.64
like

694.0 --> 699.04
on average when i watch the show now

696.64 --> 702.0
over at brandon's i find it a lot more

699.04 --> 705.5999999999999
entertaining and bearable to sit through

702.0 --> 705.6
than say half a year ago

707.68 --> 711.1999999999999
so i think brennan overall is doing a

709.519 --> 713.519
pretty good job he's getting the feel

711.2 --> 715.0400000000001
for it and he's finding a balance and

713.519 --> 717.2
yeah

715.04 --> 718.48
like it's not always that compelling to

717.2 --> 722.0
like

718.48 --> 724.0
go and be very active in the chat

722.0 --> 725.92
but just even to kind of listen to the

724.0 --> 727.839
show in the background it's pretty

725.92 --> 730.8389999999999
pretty cool pretty cool to sit through

727.839 --> 730.839
that

731.2 --> 735.12
unless they're all getting very shouty

733.2 --> 736.24
because that does happen sometimes but

735.12 --> 738.0
yeah

736.24 --> 740.399
ups and downs

738.0 --> 740.399
anyway

742.079 --> 747.4399999999999
yeah i don't think granty needs to be

743.6 --> 747.44
telling brandon how to run his show

748.639 --> 752.519
hello return to normal

759.44 --> 761.9200000000001
right

768.72 --> 773.279
so yeah unlike everybody else in the

771.36 --> 775.04
world probably

773.279 --> 777.4399999999999
that has a youtube channel or other

775.04 --> 780.7199999999999
channels i'm i didn't really plan to

777.44 --> 783.2
talk about 911

780.72 --> 783.2
today

784.48 --> 789.44
but hey if something really interesting

787.04 --> 790.8
concerning that comes up i might address

789.44 --> 793.839
it i just

790.8 --> 796.88
didn't think like oh yeah 911 let's do

793.839 --> 799.36
it all about that no

796.88 --> 801.36
i usually kind of choose to to be the

799.36 --> 803.76
only guy that doesn't talk about things

801.36 --> 806.0
when everybody else talks about that one

803.76 --> 806.0
thing

807.04 --> 809.279
uh

809.6 --> 814.0
how am i today i'm doing i'm doing just

811.839 --> 816.72
fine

814.0 --> 818.88
maybe getting a little bit tired because

816.72 --> 821.44
i'm just going to be to bed way too late

818.88 --> 821.4399999999999
these days

823.839 --> 829.36
all right

825.04 --> 831.36
also yeah been looking at my finances

829.36 --> 832.72
it's getting to that time of the month

831.36 --> 834.32
again

832.72 --> 837.519
so

834.32 --> 837.519
yeah i will run out

837.6 --> 839.9200000000001
in

840.959 --> 843.5999999999999
right before

842.639 --> 845.839
before

843.6 --> 848.639
well the week is over let's just say it

845.839 --> 850.48
like that so i really hope that

848.639 --> 853.279
some players out there

850.48 --> 855.76
that like my shows will choose this time

853.279 --> 857.519
to support me kind of like pj crew shank

855.76 --> 861.279
did yesterday

857.519 --> 861.279
because i could definitely use it

862.88 --> 867.199
and i hope that if you do because yeah

866.399 --> 869.279
what

867.199 --> 870.639
saying that's not properly constructed

869.279 --> 872.8
sentence

870.639 --> 875.6800000000001
i know that if you do that i'm going to

872.8 --> 878.959
be less worrying about that and so less

875.68 --> 881.8389999999999
distracted about money problems

878.959 --> 884.3199999999999
and will be much more easily addressing

881.839 --> 885.1990000000001
subjects in detail

884.32 --> 887.44
right

885.199 --> 890.399
for your information

887.44 --> 890.399
hey michael khan

good to see you here

892.56 --> 897.4799999999999

914.079 --> 917.079

941.199 --> 944.8389999999999
very early there

966.8 --> 969.8
what

972.16 --> 977.88
trends the trend

974.88 --> 977.88
substantiation

979.36 --> 984.48
oh and the eucharist i've never heard of

982.24 --> 984.48
that

988.8 --> 992.8
i've never heard of that word before

990.8 --> 994.7199999999999
transubstantiation

992.8 --> 996.66
what are you sure you spelled that

994.72 --> 999.78
correctly

996.66 --> 999.78
[Music]

1024.0 --> 1031.559
like those last three hours just slip by

1026.799 --> 1031.559
extremely fast this is weird

1067.76 --> 1070.0
oh

1070.48 --> 1074.64
okay so then you misspelled it and then

1073.039 --> 1077.64
it's trans

1074.64 --> 1077.64
substantiation

1085.2 --> 1089.039
okay well

1087.52 --> 1091.12
what no

1089.039 --> 1094.6
the eucharist

1091.12 --> 1094.6
and what is that

1098.72 --> 1101.809
[Music]

1105.52 --> 1109.9189999999999
a reenactment of the last supper all

1107.84 --> 1109.9189999999999
right

1111.12 --> 1115.6399999999999
what what are my thoughts on it

1124.16 --> 1128.799
i

1125.919 --> 1131.76
i think it's probably overblown

1128.799 --> 1134.96
and latched onto

1131.76 --> 1137.679
so yeah it's a very complicated thing

1134.96 --> 1140.16
because jesus himself if i'm not

1137.679 --> 1143.2
mistaken did kind of like

1140.16 --> 1143.2
even suggest

1144.24 --> 1148.84
right he made a point about

1146.72 --> 1151.76
the wine and the

1148.84 --> 1158.1999999999998
bread didn't he

1151.76 --> 1158.2
or did i did i accidentally think he did

1179.6 --> 1182.8799999999999
right because

1180.88 --> 1186.88
if he did you know

1182.88 --> 1186.88
jesus talked about a lot of

1187.28 --> 1191.6
metaphysical things

1189.28 --> 1195.52
it's like you have to recognize that so

1191.6 --> 1195.52
what i think he might have been doing

1197.919 --> 1202.24
if he actually himself said like yeah

1201.12 --> 1203.36
just think of

1202.24 --> 1207.84
the

1203.36 --> 1209.9189999999999
the wafer or the bread as my flesh and

1207.84 --> 1213.28
the wine as my blood

1209.919 --> 1213.2800000000002
well what he might have been

1213.76 --> 1218.84
trying to do at the time

1217.679 --> 1223.76
was kind

1218.84 --> 1226.24
of gave us a mechanism to hold on to

1223.76 --> 1227.44
in a period where everybody was

1226.24 --> 1229.6
like

1227.44 --> 1231.6000000000001
feeling they're gonna lose him right

1229.6 --> 1233.4399999999998
this this magnificent man in his

1231.6 --> 1235.36
teachings

1233.44 --> 1236.559
and that he was trying to help them to

1235.36 --> 1240.08
kind of like

1236.559 --> 1243.039
focus on how to get closer to him

1240.08 --> 1245.4399999999998
even though it was a trick

1243.039 --> 1248.4
like it's not literal

1245.44 --> 1250.0800000000002
but it's kind of like hey if you

1248.4 --> 1253.2800000000002
want to remember me

1250.08 --> 1253.28
you want to be close to me

1253.6 --> 1259.6789999999999
you know just remember be by this

1257.36 --> 1262.32
so you can kind of like

1259.679 --> 1265.2
associate it and hold on to like what

1262.32 --> 1268.24
did what i was like with my radiance and

1265.2 --> 1270.559
with my presence what that felt like

1268.24 --> 1273.44
and bind that feeling

1270.559 --> 1275.28
to that little ritual right

1273.44 --> 1276.799
that's something that i could

1275.28 --> 1279.52
spontaneously

1276.799 --> 1279.52
come up with

1279.679 --> 1284.64
to kind of like help

1281.84 --> 1286.08
my friends and followers if i like knew

1284.64 --> 1287.8400000000001
that yeah

1286.08 --> 1291.84
doom was coming

1287.84 --> 1291.84
i wanted to give them some

1292.96 --> 1297.039
something to help against the the grief

1295.12 --> 1299.039
that might set in right

1297.039 --> 1300.799
that's what i would think of

1299.039 --> 1303.2
now i might be getting things out of

1300.799 --> 1305.36
context slightly that's why i asked like

1303.2 --> 1308.3600000000001
did he literally say that i don't

1305.36 --> 1308.36
remember

1323.12 --> 1327.84
all right so

1324.72 --> 1330.159
yeah just stay silent right i asked a

1327.84 --> 1333.4399999999998
question don't don't actually answer the

1330.159 --> 1336.3200000000002
question just let me ramble on

1333.44 --> 1336.3200000000002
without a clue

1343.2 --> 1348.0800000000002
oh

1344.0 --> 1348.08
now it starts raining outside geez

1350.95 --> 1354.079
[Music]

1354.799 --> 1358.52
not a little too

1363.2 --> 1366.2
hmm

1377.52 --> 1383.12
you're not coarsed in that so you don't

1380.24 --> 1386.0
know you don't know what jesus said

1383.12 --> 1386.0
about it right

1386.32 --> 1391.36
because mechanically i'm not suggesting

1389.12 --> 1393.36
anything mechanically

1391.36 --> 1397.6789999999999
it could have been made up the whole

1393.36 --> 1399.6789999999999
thing about maybe he just in silent had

1397.679 --> 1401.6000000000001
the last supper

1399.679 --> 1403.52
and he didn't tell that

1401.6 --> 1406.24
he didn't tell people like ooh remember

1403.52 --> 1409.28
me by the drink and buy the bread

1406.24 --> 1411.2
maybe he didn't say that and the priest

1409.28 --> 1413.6
afterward made it up

1411.2 --> 1414.72
i'm not sure

1413.6 --> 1416.3999999999999
right

1414.72 --> 1419.44
there would have to be i would have to

1416.4 --> 1421.3600000000001
look it up and i'm very bad at looking

1419.44 --> 1423.8400000000001
[ __ ] up in the bible

1421.36 --> 1423.84
this is

1424.08 --> 1427.039
it would take time

1429.2 --> 1434.88
right so i guess nobody in chat knows

1433.6 --> 1437.36
or

1434.88 --> 1439.279
aries curse of man do you know since you

1437.36 --> 1441.76
literally brought it up

1439.279 --> 1444.64
could you perhaps answer the questions i

1441.76 --> 1448.039
asked which are integral

1444.64 --> 1448.039
to the subject

1459.84 --> 1465.84
bible verses about no but i don't care

1462.559 --> 1468.32
like what the people afterward

1465.84 --> 1470.72
even in the bible say about that

1468.32 --> 1472.3999999999999
situation like if paul talked about said

1470.72 --> 1475.919
was so very important

1472.4 --> 1478.3200000000002
no i i want to know when it happened

1475.919 --> 1479.2
if jesus himself

1478.32 --> 1482.559
said

1479.2 --> 1482.559
something about it

1483.76 --> 1488.08
that the priesthood later would have

1487.12 --> 1490.7199999999998
to

1488.08 --> 1492.3999999999999
latch onto and make it into a really big

1490.72 --> 1493.84
thing in a tradition

1492.4 --> 1495.6000000000001
in the church

1493.84 --> 1497.9189999999999
i'm asking

1495.6 --> 1501.6399999999999
i'm asking

1497.919 --> 1501.64
hello dutch sailor

1515.44 --> 1521.679
one of the debating points what the hell

1517.84 --> 1524.48
is the debate about it either he himself

1521.679 --> 1526.24
when it happened said these things

1524.48 --> 1529.279
or he didn't

1526.24 --> 1531.2
that is the only relevant question here

1529.279 --> 1534.0
really about it

1531.2 --> 1536.48
did jesus himself say oh think of this

1534.0 --> 1539.6
bread as my flesh think of this wine as

1536.48 --> 1542.48
my blood did he

1539.6 --> 1545.36
say that or didn't he

1542.48 --> 1545.3600000000001
that's the question

1548.559 --> 1552.0
god

1549.76 --> 1552.0
that

1555.2 --> 1555.2
oh what

1575.679 --> 1580.799
that's pathetic gary everest that's

1578.08 --> 1580.799
really pathetic

1581.84 --> 1584.9599999999998
and that's a paradoxical statement

1583.44 --> 1588.24
because if you were jesus you would

1584.96 --> 1588.24
definitely not do that

1591.12 --> 1599.0
because jesus doesn't do that and you

1595.36 --> 1599.0
can get out

1607.36 --> 1613.12
god said no i'm not asking god jesus in

1611.039 --> 1616.32
red letters not god

1613.12 --> 1616.32
did jesus say that

1623.44 --> 1631.8400000000001
i don't care about the debating points

1627.44 --> 1634.8400000000001
i just want to know if he said it or not

1631.84 --> 1634.84
right

1644.88 --> 1647.88
yes

1674.0 --> 1681.0
but what exactly did he say i need to

1676.799 --> 1681.0
freaking look it up this is

1693.039 --> 1696.52
where is that

1696.799 --> 1702.36
[ __ ] i have no idea how to find this

1710.88 --> 1715.3600000000001
there's not like a singular chapter

1713.2 --> 1717.52
where that specifically happens right

1715.36 --> 1719.52
it's talked about through different

1717.52 --> 1722.0
people

1719.52 --> 1723.84
just like how this is how does this work

1722.0 --> 1727.44
i'm so terrible at finding things in the

1723.84 --> 1727.4399999999998
bible i'm just the worst

1735.6 --> 1740.1589999999999
right

1736.84 --> 1741.52
john 6

1740.159 --> 1744.64
all right i'm just

1741.52 --> 1744.6399999999999
jesus said unto them

1750.84 --> 1754.559
verily wait what

1755.84 --> 1760.799
except he eats the flesh of the son of

1758.48 --> 1762.72
man

1760.799 --> 1765.679
so he didn't

1762.72 --> 1765.679
actually mention

1765.84 --> 1770.08
himself in the first person

1768.48 --> 1772.48
he referred to

1770.08 --> 1774.48
a third person

1772.48 --> 1777.44
his

1774.48 --> 1780.3990000000001
and you have no life

1777.44 --> 1782.72
no life in you

1780.399 --> 1782.7199999999998
wow

1783.279 --> 1787.679
so

1784.799 --> 1790.0
he didn't say it

1787.679 --> 1794.799
he said something about

1790.0 --> 1797.76
ye son of man the son of man and their

1794.799 --> 1797.76
blood and flesh

1800.48 --> 1804.919
who so eateth my flesh

1808.32 --> 1812.4399999999998
okay every squishy man

1822.72 --> 1827.52
so is that all in red letters

1825.039 --> 1827.52
aries

1828.559 --> 1835.32
to specify that geez that it literally

1831.2 --> 1835.32
came out of jesus's mouth

1841.36 --> 1846.8799999999999
he referred to himself as the son of man

1843.679 --> 1846.88
what that's odd

1847.36 --> 1852.9599999999998
don't mean to be disrespectful but to me

1851.679 --> 1854.88
there's a

1852.96 --> 1856.559
non-religious approach to that kind of

1854.88 --> 1860.72
sounds like when i'm talking about

1856.559 --> 1860.72
myself as being an elven wizard

1861.44 --> 1865.279
if you get my drift

1863.12 --> 1868.2399999999998
that's weird but fine

1865.279 --> 1872.12
who might complain

1868.24 --> 1872.1200000000001
he's the best of us

1898.08 --> 1902.399
yeah yeah yeah sorry tony whitcomb i

1900.159 --> 1904.72
almost overlooked i was like reading

1902.399 --> 1907.6
into that uh yeah i'll check paypal

1904.72 --> 1910.64
thank you very much

1907.6 --> 1910.6399999999999
the most welcome

1919.12 --> 1925.12
yes thank you very much

1921.76 --> 1925.12
i really appreciate that

1930.72 --> 1934.039
that's great

1940.08 --> 1943.32
thank you

1950.0 --> 1956.159
yeah michael khan yeah yeah that that

1953.519 --> 1960.32
riddle there i'm not

1956.159 --> 1960.3200000000002
yeah i'm not buying into that at all

1961.44 --> 1965.039
or well there's just ways you could

1963.36 --> 1968.08
interpret that that

1965.039 --> 1970.08
make it not hold all that much weight

1968.08 --> 1973.96
in the way that is

1970.08 --> 1973.96
popularly conceived

1978.559 --> 1983.84
right soon as you go into like blood

1981.36 --> 1988.08
sacrifice that immediately contradicts

1983.84 --> 1993.1589999999999
the loss of god for man so

1988.08 --> 1993.1589999999999
yeah not buying that at all

2005.039 --> 2008.96
right

2006.08 --> 2011.36
you know it makes it like creepy in a

2008.96 --> 2014.32
lot of ways

2011.36 --> 2017.279
especially look if that is really it

2014.32 --> 2020.72
then the whole idea of

2017.279 --> 2023.919
eat my flesh drink my blood

2020.72 --> 2023.919
is very creepy

2026.24 --> 2031.519
if he's also supposed to be a blood

2028.48 --> 2035.1200000000001
sacrifice to god

2031.519 --> 2037.279
to pay for taking our sins away which is

2035.12 --> 2039.4399999999998
preposterous

2037.279 --> 2041.919
sins are all still there it doesn't take

2039.44 --> 2041.919
it away

2042.08 --> 2046.48
all jesus really did

2044.799 --> 2049.04
through his knowledge through his

2046.48 --> 2051.76
communication is given opportunity to

2049.04 --> 2055.24
avoid the sins by recognizing them and

2051.76 --> 2055.2400000000002
what they do

2065.679 --> 2070.879
but yeah it sounds really weird you know

2067.599 --> 2072.8790000000004
like ooh drink my blood eat my flesh of

2070.879 --> 2077.1189999999997
the soul of man or whatever to remember

2072.879 --> 2079.52
me and then like he dies and so then

2077.119 --> 2081.679
i don't know

2079.52 --> 2083.359
they took that all literal they like

2081.679 --> 2084.7200000000003
might just like

2083.359 --> 2087.5989999999997
wait

2084.72 --> 2091.1189999999997
for like how did he make it

2087.599 --> 2094.8790000000004
back to the burial ground like

2091.119 --> 2098.2400000000002
wouldn't they just like try to like

2094.879 --> 2101.2
well get really disgusting and basically

2098.24 --> 2103.68
take his flesh and his blood

2101.2 --> 2105.2
to remember him by like it's just very

2103.68 --> 2107.2
freaky

2105.2 --> 2109.9199999999996
like i don't think it all means what

2107.2 --> 2113.16
everybody thinks it means

2109.92 --> 2113.16
like that

2116.48 --> 2121.2
free us from death but that's ridiculous

2119.28 --> 2123.28
we're not free from death we're all

2121.2 --> 2128.2799999999997
bound to death that's ridiculous that

2123.28 --> 2128.28
makes no sense michael khan sorry

2132.8 --> 2136.96
he died without sin

2134.64 --> 2136.96
yes

2143.2 --> 2148.0
oh well yeah

2144.96 --> 2148.0
as far as i could tell

2149.599 --> 2154.4
but i'm not even sure whether he

2151.2 --> 2157.2
actually died there on the cross

2154.4 --> 2159.44
i'm not 100 sure like people keep

2157.2 --> 2161.839
telling me about this but that they made

2159.44 --> 2164.4
sure this is that i'm like nah that's

2161.839 --> 2166.0789999999997
very nice but

2164.4 --> 2169.079
i actually think he might have made it

2166.079 --> 2169.079
through

2172.4 --> 2175.76
but that's just me

2175.92 --> 2179.64
and a few others

2199.359 --> 2203.44
yeah dude

2200.8 --> 2205.44
just don't take it

2203.44 --> 2207.76
don't take it and then don't go

2205.44 --> 2209.04
completely paranoid even if you haven't

2207.76 --> 2211.28
taken it

2209.04 --> 2213.52
right and hey don't go paranoid if you

2211.28 --> 2216.6400000000003
have taken it

2213.52 --> 2216.64
just stay calm

2217.76 --> 2220.32
you know what's gonna happen is gonna

2219.28 --> 2224.8
happen

2220.32 --> 2224.8
it's no use getting all crazy over it

2226.16 --> 2230.0789999999997
just don't take it everything should be

2228.16 --> 2233.44
all right i think that the whole idea of

2230.079 --> 2236.48
like oh they are going to infect us is

2233.44 --> 2238.48
highly overblown

2236.48 --> 2240.32
i think there's resonance issues i think

2238.48 --> 2243.92
that yeah if your energy field is going

2240.32 --> 2243.92
to be messed up by this v

2244.4 --> 2249.76
which it probably does apparently

2246.4 --> 2252.48
measurably so then

2249.76 --> 2253.8390000000004
just be wary of that just like somebody

2252.48 --> 2256.079
that's like

2253.839 --> 2258.56
on the verge of a psychotic break right

2256.079 --> 2260.96
they have all this kind of like

2258.56 --> 2262.72
raw energy coming off them and they have

2260.96 --> 2264.64
strange ways they can look out of their

2262.72 --> 2266.56
eyes right well when you know that about

2264.64 --> 2268.72
somebody you're going to be careful

2266.56 --> 2270.96
you're not going to be just like oh

2268.72 --> 2272.56
i'm going gonna hug you randomly or

2270.96 --> 2274.96
maybe you would because

2272.56 --> 2277.7599999999998
i that would be what you do whatever but

2274.96 --> 2280.7200000000003
you'd be wary like okay this peop this

2277.76 --> 2283.2000000000003
person is under pressure that means

2280.72 --> 2286.72
there's literal tension coming forth

2283.2 --> 2289.4399999999996
from that that [ __ ] can rub off on you

2286.72 --> 2291.52
you might catch that tension

2289.44 --> 2293.52
right

2291.52 --> 2295.7599999999998
and maybe that is the way through

2293.52 --> 2297.52
resonance

2295.76 --> 2299.28
that it seems

2297.52 --> 2301.359
non-veed

2299.28 --> 2302.6400000000003
can get

2301.359 --> 2305.68
well sick

2302.64 --> 2307.359
from interaction with feed

2305.68 --> 2309.9199999999996
that's what i think is going on there's

2307.359 --> 2313.3199999999997
no actual effect it's all

2309.92 --> 2313.32
so overblown

2315.2 --> 2321.96
anyway back to the other subject

2318.96 --> 2321.96
hmm

2326.96 --> 2330.96
why don't you tell us what you think

2328.56 --> 2333.839
happens after you die

2330.96 --> 2336.64
that's this only the beginning it's

2333.839 --> 2339.04
i can't tell it all depends on

2336.64 --> 2341.839
who you are what you done

2339.04 --> 2341.839
what you learned

2342.24 --> 2345.5989999999997
i think there's a whole bunch of things

2344.4 --> 2347.44
that can

2345.599 --> 2349.04
happen

2347.44 --> 2352.4
i think that after that you could

2349.04 --> 2355.44
reincarnate maybe very quickly maybe

2352.4 --> 2357.28
like what i've suspected even like

2355.44 --> 2360.64
15 years ago

2357.28 --> 2363.0400000000004
is that when you die

2360.64 --> 2366.0
you face god you basically

2363.04 --> 2367.44
go up to god or god comes to you

2366.0 --> 2368.96
depending on how you're going to look at

2367.44 --> 2371.92
it in the other dimension and you're

2368.96 --> 2372.8
going to face everything you've done

2371.92 --> 2375.359
and

2372.8 --> 2379.599
have all the white noise taken away so

2375.359 --> 2381.839
you get to experience it without

2379.599 --> 2384.0
without a shield

2381.839 --> 2386.0789999999997
right so you basically get to face the

2384.0 --> 2389.359
absolute reality of everything you've

2386.079 --> 2389.3590000000004
done good and bad

2390.0 --> 2395.68
and my it might even become presented to

2392.48 --> 2397.92
you in a very specific setting

2395.68 --> 2400.0
to strengthen

2397.92 --> 2402.88
that confrontation

2400.0 --> 2405.04
so it might be focused into a phase of

2402.88 --> 2406.1600000000003
heaven and a phase of hell

2405.04 --> 2409.599
hopefully

2406.16 --> 2411.839
heaven comes second so you first face

2409.599 --> 2413.599
everything you've suppressed you didn't

2411.839 --> 2415.44
that was terrible

2413.599 --> 2416.6400000000003
you basically feel the weight of all

2415.44 --> 2418.88
your sin

2416.64 --> 2420.56
and then afterward

2418.88 --> 2423.04
you basically then

2420.56 --> 2424.88
would face god and and be asked like

2423.04 --> 2427.599
okay so

2424.88 --> 2427.599
did you get it

2430.0 --> 2434.48
and then and yeah you keep on going

2432.24 --> 2435.839
through that until you get it until you

2434.48 --> 2438.16
accept

2435.839 --> 2440.4
and then after you get to experience all

2438.16 --> 2442.16
the good things

2440.4 --> 2444.56
and

2442.16 --> 2448.24
might potentially be able to experience

2444.56 --> 2450.56
that enjoy that until you are satisfied

2448.24 --> 2453.1189999999997
in your spirit

2450.56 --> 2456.24
till you can basically let go of that

2453.119 --> 2457.6800000000003
format of existence and all the memories

2456.24 --> 2461.5989999999997
that come with it

2457.68 --> 2464.64
and then you move on to something else

2461.599 --> 2466.56
to an an actual afterlife another

2464.64 --> 2468.64
continuum existence maybe a

2466.56 --> 2471.2799999999997
reincarnation maybe you'll go back or

2468.64 --> 2474.0789999999997
maybe you'll move to the other place

2471.28 --> 2474.079
whatever that is

2484.72 --> 2489.04
your nation is bonkrom because you

2486.72 --> 2493.1189999999997
believe scripture well i've heard that

2489.04 --> 2495.839
jesus actually talks about reincarnation

2493.119 --> 2495.839
but not in the

2496.0 --> 2500.16
in the eastern

2497.76 --> 2500.1600000000003
sense

2502.4 --> 2507.2400000000002
so

2504.24 --> 2507.24
yeah

2513.44 --> 2519.2000000000003
okay gary everest i already addressed

2516.48 --> 2523.48
that question i literally just did don't

2519.2 --> 2523.48
know why you're asking again

2524.96 --> 2531.44
you literally copy pasted the same thing

2528.319 --> 2532.88
when i just explained it in detail what

2531.44 --> 2534.7200000000003
i think

2532.88 --> 2537.839
it's very odd

2534.72 --> 2537.839
odd behavior there

2551.119 --> 2554.56
will be resurrected

2554.96 --> 2560.04
right

2556.72 --> 2560.04
well maybe

2564.88 --> 2568.6400000000003
i mean if there is some kind of a like

2567.119 --> 2570.6400000000003
next level

2568.64 --> 2572.72
a kingdom of heaven

2570.64 --> 2573.52
i'd love to be part of that and i hope

2572.72 --> 2576.56
that

2573.52 --> 2578.64
god forgives me for my transgressions in

2576.56 --> 2580.48
the past because i did go

2578.64 --> 2583.04
in ways pretty dark

2580.48 --> 2586.64
i get i took risks

2583.04 --> 2586.64
because of my curiosity and

2586.8 --> 2590.8
i don't know

2589.119 --> 2594.0
but i certainly hope

2590.8 --> 2597.2000000000003
that i'd be admitted despite not me just

2594.0 --> 2600.4
like chanting all day like oh i have to

2597.2 --> 2603.4399999999996
believe this little riddle or i'm barred

2600.4 --> 2604.839
oh god please don't make me doubt the

2603.44 --> 2608.7200000000003
riddle

2604.839 --> 2611.52
right i'm kind of like aiming

2608.72 --> 2614.0
on that that is [ __ ]

2611.52 --> 2615.92
but yeah that might not exclude people

2614.0 --> 2617.44
that believe that from actually being

2615.92 --> 2619.28
able to enter heaven but i think

2617.44 --> 2621.359
personally it's a distraction it's a

2619.28 --> 2624.1600000000003
lock

2621.359 --> 2624.16
for your mind

2626.88 --> 2630.599
but that's just me

2634.48 --> 2639.119
i think we're all constantly being

2636.4 --> 2640.88
tested and one of these tests is also

2639.119 --> 2642.2400000000002
intellectual

2640.88 --> 2643.92
and we face

2642.24 --> 2645.9199999999996
riddles

2643.92 --> 2649.52
and that if we're overwhelmed by the

2645.92 --> 2652.079
body of works of where the riddles are

2649.52 --> 2654.72
or the body of work associated with it

2652.079 --> 2656.96
when it's being told to us

2654.72 --> 2658.3999999999996
that a lot of people unfortunately

2656.96 --> 2659.28
decide to

2658.4 --> 2661.839
not

2659.28 --> 2663.2000000000003
deal with it not try to figure out what

2661.839 --> 2665.68
is said

2663.2 --> 2667.9199999999996
in a deeper way and instead let their

2665.68 --> 2669.68
fear just make them

2667.92 --> 2671.52
surrender to something they don't

2669.68 --> 2673.359
understand

2671.52 --> 2675.839
and then they believe from that point on

2673.359 --> 2679.2799999999997
i have to chant this or i i'm in big

2675.839 --> 2679.2799999999997
trouble in the face of god

2680.48 --> 2684.319
when that makes absolutely no logical

2683.359 --> 2687.44
sense

2684.319 --> 2689.119
like that entire process of thinking and

2687.44 --> 2691.359
response is

2689.119 --> 2695.119
a dark mechanism it's a mind control

2691.359 --> 2695.119
mechanism right not saying that

2695.52 --> 2699.599
well no i am say it is a mind control

2698.24 --> 2702.16
mechanism

2699.599 --> 2702.1600000000003
that's like

2702.56 --> 2710.24
basic say something then you use fear

2707.68 --> 2712.48
it's like okay if you don't believe this

2710.24 --> 2714.9599999999996
nonsense chant

2712.48 --> 2716.8
that might be very complicated it might

2714.96 --> 2719.44
be very carefully crafted but if you

2716.8 --> 2721.76
don't believe it you go to hell

2719.44 --> 2723.839
and then make everything about that

2721.76 --> 2726.7200000000003
about people that reject it and then

2723.839 --> 2730.7599999999998
they are doomed and they are persecuted

2726.72 --> 2730.7599999999998
that's what happened at first

2740.96 --> 2743.96
okay

2748.64 --> 2755.92
i didn't talk about what happened yeah i

2751.44 --> 2755.92
did gary everest are you demented

2759.68 --> 2763.7599999999998
what the hell

2761.68 --> 2765.5989999999997
yeah i did talk about that i addressed

2763.76 --> 2766.96
it in full like

2765.599 --> 2768.88
dutch sailor

2766.96 --> 2770.2400000000002
gary or i mean

2768.88 --> 2771.28
michael khan

2770.24 --> 2774.0789999999997
aries

2771.28 --> 2776.48
did i address his question that he copy

2774.079 --> 2779.599
pasted twice and he now says i didn't

2776.48 --> 2783.16
address it did i address it or didn't i

2779.599 --> 2783.1600000000003
i think i did

2793.839 --> 2799.68
you simply well dude

2796.079 --> 2801.6800000000003
john hernandez anybody

2799.68 --> 2805.5989999999997
that would try to communicate anything

2801.68 --> 2808.72
about the bible to me with all caps

2805.599 --> 2811.28
is immediately disqualified

2808.72 --> 2811.2799999999997
understand

2811.76 --> 2816.8
because that means you're chanting

2814.88 --> 2819.76
and especially if you don't if you say

2816.8 --> 2823.2000000000003
oh you don't have to understand

2819.76 --> 2824.7200000000003
you have to believe yes screw you

2823.2 --> 2826.96
screw

2824.72 --> 2826.9599999999996
you

2827.04 --> 2831.7599999999998
understanding is the key to

2828.8 --> 2834.7200000000003
enlightenment not belief in that which

2831.76 --> 2834.7200000000003
you don't understand

2842.559 --> 2845.8390000000004
i know that's what you've been told

2849.52 --> 2853.24
i'm not buying that

2858.079 --> 2864.76
don't take the screw you too personal

2861.76 --> 2864.76
uh

2874.4 --> 2878.0
gary

2875.359 --> 2881.44
could you please stop copy pasting the

2878.0 --> 2884.4
same [ __ ] like i'm gonna ban you you're

2881.44 --> 2884.4
really annoying

2885.76 --> 2889.599
i'm starting to have doubts you're

2887.359 --> 2891.68
actually a real person because this is

2889.599 --> 2894.0
not how a real person would normally

2891.68 --> 2897.0
communicate it's very weird what you're

2894.0 --> 2897.0
doing

2918.8 --> 2922.88
hmm

2921.119 --> 2925.28
right yeah michael cohn that sounds

2922.88 --> 2927.52
sensible

2925.28 --> 2930.96
prophecy of the scripture is not of any

2927.52 --> 2930.96
private interpretation

2931.76 --> 2935.079
that's fine

2946.8 --> 2951.6800000000003
right so that literally then excludes

2949.04 --> 2951.68
everybody

2952.079 --> 2957.2000000000003
right i'm not gonna

2954.079 --> 2958.4
if that private interpretation is versus

2957.2 --> 2960.5589999999997
like a

2958.4 --> 2964.559
religious authority

2960.559 --> 2966.88
then don't mind me if i don't buy that

2964.559 --> 2970.1600000000003
because that would contradict

2966.88 --> 2973.119
foundations of what christ taught

2970.16 --> 2974.64
that give no authority

2973.119 --> 2978.079
to another man

2974.64 --> 2978.0789999999997
when it concerns to god

2978.319 --> 2982.8
but it concerns god right might be

2980.559 --> 2984.4
slightly paraphrasing but yeah he said

2982.8 --> 2985.44
that that is

2984.4 --> 2987.599
really

2985.44 --> 2990.7200000000003
really fundamental and important in

2987.599 --> 2992.96
everything and identifying what is going

2990.72 --> 2992.9599999999996
on

2993.04 --> 2997.88
with christianity it's critical

3001.119 --> 3004.119
um

3019.839 --> 3023.52
okay

3021.04 --> 3025.68
well could you elaborate

3023.52 --> 3028.24
on that john hernandez

3025.68 --> 3029.359
the great exchange concerning christ

3028.24 --> 3032.4799999999996
could you

3029.359 --> 3035.88
just say what what that is then

3032.48 --> 3035.88
that would be great

3055.44 --> 3058.48
yeah i know michael khan you are only

3057.44 --> 3060.319
telling you

3058.48 --> 3062.16
me what scripture says

3060.319 --> 3064.319
yeah and i'm then

3062.16 --> 3066.96
using scripture

3064.319 --> 3068.48
to identify how

3066.96 --> 3070.88
certain

3068.48 --> 3073.76
angles of interpretation should be

3070.88 --> 3073.76
excluded

3074.4 --> 3079.76
right because i'm interpreting

3077.52 --> 3081.599
knowing this first that no prophecy of

3079.76 --> 3084.2400000000002
the scripture is of any private

3081.599 --> 3087.599
interpretation that basically means

3084.24 --> 3089.7599999999998
there is no interpretation

3087.599 --> 3092.7200000000003
because the private interpretation is

3089.76 --> 3095.3590000000004
the only interpretation it should be

3092.72 --> 3097.1189999999997
because that's the only privately is

3095.359 --> 3099.359
where you

3097.119 --> 3102.96
find god

3099.359 --> 3102.96
by jesus's own words

3103.359 --> 3107.2799999999997
paraphrasing slightly but that is

3105.119 --> 3109.52
definitely the meaning of it

3107.28 --> 3111.8390000000004
as i remember

3109.52 --> 3111.839
right

3170.319 --> 3175.52
pilgrimage is once considered very

3173.04 --> 3175.52
important

3178.96 --> 3184.559
right but that's for pragmatic reasons

3182.079 --> 3186.88
also it's because traveling

3184.559 --> 3188.8
makes you learn a lot and it confronts

3186.88 --> 3191.52
you with the differences and

3188.8 --> 3193.6800000000003
similarities in different

3191.52 --> 3196.24
people of different peoples in different

3193.68 --> 3196.24
regions

3197.44 --> 3200.319
right

3198.24 --> 3202.4799999999996
because anybody that would go on to a

3200.319 --> 3206.0
pilgrimage especially when in the old

3202.48 --> 3206.0
days when they would do it by foot

3206.8 --> 3211.2000000000003
they would always return a much wiser

3210.0 --> 3214.24
man

3211.2 --> 3216.5589999999997
always because it is quite an experience

3214.24 --> 3218.72
you learn a lot about yourself and other

3216.559 --> 3220.48
people

3218.72 --> 3223.4399999999996
right

3220.48 --> 3225.839
funny thing is is that

3223.44 --> 3228.2400000000002
the mormons

3225.839 --> 3231.04
still kind of utilize that they they did

3228.24 --> 3232.5589999999997
that in their own way so they send out

3231.04 --> 3234.96
elders

3232.559 --> 3236.6400000000003
and they go out all over the world

3234.96 --> 3238.64
effectively doing the same thing now

3236.64 --> 3240.0
it's not like a pilgrimage to a specific

3238.64 --> 3241.92
location

3240.0 --> 3243.92
but it is like no you go to another

3241.92 --> 3244.64
country with completely different people

3243.92 --> 3248.4
and

3244.64 --> 3248.4
you just figure it out

3249.52 --> 3254.8
which is also

3251.04 --> 3254.8
a learn learning experience

3256.96 --> 3260.0
so i'd like to compare that to

3258.48 --> 3261.599
pilgrimage

3260.0 --> 3265.0
i thought it was very interesting that

3261.599 --> 3265.0
they do that

3277.52 --> 3281.2
what

3279.359 --> 3284.48
that's ridiculous

3281.2 --> 3286.72
john hernandez serious did always work

3284.48 --> 3290.16
on the crowd no

3286.72 --> 3292.9599999999996
no dying is not the task

3290.16 --> 3294.3999999999996
it's not the glorious task he performed

3292.96 --> 3297.119
yeah dying

3294.4 --> 3298.799
this freaking death worship i'm so sick

3297.119 --> 3301.52
of hearing about that

3298.799 --> 3301.52
it's sick

3303.28 --> 3306.3190000000004
like

3304.16 --> 3309.44
what the hell would any of it have

3306.319 --> 3310.72
mattered if christ just freaking died on

3309.44 --> 3313.119
that cross

3310.72 --> 3314.8799999999997
and you and he wouldn't have given all

3313.119 --> 3316.2400000000002
his advice he wouldn't have done all the

3314.88 --> 3318.319
things he did

3316.24 --> 3320.64
then what the hell

3318.319 --> 3325.04
would he have effectively caused in it

3320.64 --> 3329.64
as a change a measurable provable change

3325.04 --> 3329.64
onto the world this is it's just

3333.81 --> 3336.96
[Music]

3337.52 --> 3342.0
teaching

3339.119 --> 3342.0
was his job

3342.64 --> 3347.2
that's his works

3344.64 --> 3349.5989999999997
the teachings the words

3347.2 --> 3353.5589999999997
it's not him dying

3349.599 --> 3353.559
sick of hearing that

3367.359 --> 3370.359
ugh

3381.69 --> 3385.07
[Music]

3412.88 --> 3418.6400000000003
yeah that's right michael khan well

3415.839 --> 3421.7599999999998
that could still all have been and he

3418.64 --> 3423.7599999999998
didn't die all of that right

3421.76 --> 3427.3590000000004
because

3423.76 --> 3430.559
you could consider that he had to die as

3427.359 --> 3432.799
in that was the only way he would get

3430.559 --> 3434.96
out

3432.799 --> 3437.44
get out of the process that he had

3434.96 --> 3440.88
engaged with full dedication

3437.44 --> 3440.88
the high level teaching

3441.04 --> 3445.839
and if he would have held on to it there

3443.44 --> 3448.559
would have been like a big war and

3445.839 --> 3451.52
probably the total destruction of his

3448.559 --> 3457.119
entire works his actual works this

3451.52 --> 3457.119
teachings right so he knew he had to die

3457.2 --> 3462.64
become officially out of the picture

3460.16 --> 3464.16
right and then when somebody that loved

3462.64 --> 3466.96
him

3464.16 --> 3468.24
really deeply like peter and didn't want

3466.96 --> 3470.4
him to go

3468.24 --> 3473.04
i don't want you to go he said like no

3470.4 --> 3476.1600000000003
i'm sorry this has to happen that's not

3473.04 --> 3477.92
oh i have to die now that means i have

3476.16 --> 3480.24
to get out

3477.92 --> 3482.64
of this situation this is the only way

3480.24 --> 3484.72
it can go or everything will be

3482.64 --> 3487.7599999999998
destroyed my works

3484.72 --> 3490.3999999999996
would be erased

3487.76 --> 3492.88
because it would lead to a war

3490.4 --> 3492.88
you see

3492.96 --> 3501.319
he didn't have to die

3496.16 --> 3501.319
but he had to get out of the picture

3506.799 --> 3509.799
ah

3526.799 --> 3531.359
right and if he would have just like

3528.799 --> 3532.799
fled

3531.359 --> 3535.839
that wouldn't have worked it would have

3532.799 --> 3537.599
also degraded his work so he had to like

3535.839 --> 3539.92
officially die

3537.599 --> 3540.88
that was the only way he could get out

3539.92 --> 3542.559
of that

3540.88 --> 3547.559
position

3542.559 --> 3547.559
and have his legacy maintained

3578.559 --> 3583.8390000000004
i'm sick of hearing that

3581.44 --> 3585.92
when i identify

3583.839 --> 3588.319
because i've come to what what does that

3585.92 --> 3590.319
mean what are you talking about now i'm

3588.319 --> 3593.599
sick of hearing it because it makes no

3590.319 --> 3596.319
sense and it makes people obsessed with

3593.599 --> 3599.44
his death obsessed with death it's like

3596.319 --> 3602.0
literally staring at a freaking human

3599.44 --> 3604.48
sacrifice ritual

3602.0 --> 3607.04
you know how sick that is

3604.48 --> 3609.839
you're being mentally spellbound to a

3607.04 --> 3611.7599999999998
freaking human sacrifice ritual you

3609.839 --> 3615.839
maniacs

3611.76 --> 3615.8390000000004
you don't even know what you're doing

3616.88 --> 3622.0
he didn't have to die he had to

3619.359 --> 3624.16
officially die to get out of the picture

3622.0 --> 3628.24
stop being persecuted

3624.16 --> 3633.2799999999997
and have his legacy maintained

3628.24 --> 3633.2799999999997
he didn't physically have to die

3634.559 --> 3637.76
it's not about that

3639.599 --> 3646.96
no that's [ __ ] you don't stop death

3642.72 --> 3649.359
through sin if you sin you die

3646.96 --> 3651.68
he didn't stop that that happens right

3649.359 --> 3654.5589999999997
now the world still works like this it's

3651.68 --> 3656.72
the design if you sin it's gonna wear on

3654.559 --> 3660.1600000000003
you and if you sin too much and you hold

3656.72 --> 3662.72
on to it too long it's gonna kill you

3660.16 --> 3666.96
jesus didn't take that away by being a

3662.72 --> 3668.799
freaking human sacrifice you freak

3666.96 --> 3672.48
it's still there

3668.799 --> 3674.24
stop deluding yourself

3672.48 --> 3676.72
sorry i'm yelling

3674.24 --> 3679.2
this is not just you i'm talking to it's

3676.72 --> 3680.0
talking to like millions of people out

3679.2 --> 3684.5989999999997
there

3680.0 --> 3684.599
that hold on to this craziness

3689.44 --> 3696.92
and i can finally yell

3692.72 --> 3696.9199999999996
because nobody else is home here

3701.52 --> 3706.839
oh i don't get the point of why jesus oh

3704.16 --> 3710.64
you mean to be a human

3706.839 --> 3713.359
sacrifice so you can believe

3710.64 --> 3715.5989999999997
that you're free from sin that it

3713.359 --> 3718.5589999999997
doesn't kill you anymore

3715.599 --> 3721.839
i don't get the point why he came to be

3718.559 --> 3723.44
a human sacrifice so you could falsely

3721.839 --> 3726.88
believe

3723.44 --> 3729.92
that sins don't kill you anymore really

3726.88 --> 3732.4
i don't get it do i

3729.92 --> 3732.4
god

3732.64 --> 3736.92
i think you don't get it

3741.76 --> 3744.1600000000003
ah

3746.24 --> 3749.4399999999996
jesus gave his life

3750.88 --> 3755.2000000000003
yeah you know how funny that is

3753.52 --> 3756.72
when you say it like that yeah he did

3755.2 --> 3759.52
gave his life

3756.72 --> 3761.839
he gave his life he lived

3759.52 --> 3764.319
he gave it his all

3761.839 --> 3766.5589999999997
and made a legacy of information and

3764.319 --> 3768.799
knowledge and wisdom that echo on to

3766.559 --> 3772.48
this day and have changed

3768.799 --> 3772.48
the mind of men

3774.24 --> 3781.5989999999997
his information changed the mind of men

3779.119 --> 3784.799
okay

3781.599 --> 3784.799
he gave his life

3786.48 --> 3793.52
he didn't let his life be taken as a

3789.92 --> 3797.6800000000003
human sacrifice so you could imagine

3793.52 --> 3800.559
that sins no longer kill you

3797.68 --> 3800.5589999999997
how ironic

3802.559 --> 3804.799
uh

3806.559 --> 3810.2400000000002
no you're good in your faith well that's

3808.319 --> 3812.48
fine you can keep on chanting all you

3810.24 --> 3812.4799999999996
like

3818.4 --> 3823.119
don't start my day upset i'm not

3820.799 --> 3825.2
starting my day upset this [ __ ] has been

3823.119 --> 3827.359
upsetting me for a long time because i

3825.2 --> 3829.2
hate it when good people chant

3827.359 --> 3832.4
themselves

3829.2 --> 3834.5589999999997
into just this mind numb state

3832.4 --> 3836.839
where you take something preposterous

3834.559 --> 3840.3190000000004
for granted

3836.839 --> 3843.68
preposterous illogical contradictive to

3840.319 --> 3843.68
god's freaking law

3844.0 --> 3851.28
the god's laws that still stand

3848.48 --> 3854.64
the sins

3851.28 --> 3856.7200000000003
that's not taken away right whenever any

3854.64 --> 3858.96
freaking catholic priest or whatever

3856.72 --> 3861.68
says like oh we take away the sin oh the

3858.96 --> 3864.559
original sin the sin that you're born

3861.68 --> 3867.2
with something you've done wrong before

3864.559 --> 3871.8390000000004
you've ever done something

3867.2 --> 3871.839
it takes away that that made up [ __ ]

3872.88 --> 3875.28
sorry

3876.319 --> 3881.839
if that could have been taken away then

3878.0 --> 3881.839
it never existed

3888.319 --> 3892.48
this just

3890.319 --> 3895.839
it doesn't make any sense to me at all

3892.48 --> 3895.839
nothing about it does

3903.46 --> 3907.359
[Music]

3905.039 --> 3909.8390000000004
your faith in everlasting that's really

3907.359 --> 3909.839
nice

3911.839 --> 3915.839
i like to just

3913.2 --> 3918.799
learn about how reality works how the

3915.839 --> 3920.0789999999997
design actually is and with that like

3918.799 --> 3923.359
what

3920.079 --> 3924.559
does the designer expect of us why are

3923.359 --> 3927.68
we here

3924.559 --> 3930.0
what are these tests why are they like

3927.68 --> 3930.0
that

3930.16 --> 3935.16
actual pragmatic approach

3938.72 --> 3942.9599999999996
you see i believe there's a point to

3940.559 --> 3946.2400000000002
this all and i believe that point

3942.96 --> 3948.96
can be understood it's beyond just you

3946.24 --> 3950.8799999999997
have to believe this and chant it even

3948.96 --> 3953.359
though you don't understand it because

3950.88 --> 3955.92
don't try to understand it

3953.359 --> 3957.2
because you might risk being barred from

3955.92 --> 3958.799
heaven

3957.2 --> 3961.2
seriously

3958.799 --> 3961.2
guys

3964.48 --> 3969.2
no i'm not gonna talk to paula

3967.2 --> 3972.64
dude she kicked me out when i when i

3969.2 --> 3974.799
started to make my claims about this

3972.64 --> 3979.2
i'm not going back there it's she's

3974.799 --> 3981.599
nothing she she has nothing to tell me

3979.2 --> 3984.64
that's of any use about this

3981.599 --> 3986.799
i mean her knowledge her

3984.64 --> 3988.799
knowledge of all the works and even what

3986.799 --> 3991.2
people have said about in the different

3988.799 --> 3994.16
philosophy philosophical traits and all

3991.2 --> 3996.16
that yeah she knows a lot i do respect

3994.16 --> 3997.359
that but

3996.16 --> 4000.8799999999997
she is

3997.359 --> 4004.16
just holding on to the chance

4000.88 --> 4007.2000000000003
and she just found more body of works to

4004.16 --> 4010.64
justify why she holds on to the chance

4007.2 --> 4012.3999999999996
that doesn't make the chance logical

4010.64 --> 4014.96
doesn't stop them from being

4012.4 --> 4017.96
contradictive

4014.96 --> 4017.96
so

4020.88 --> 4023.88
uh

4039.039 --> 4042.039
uh

4072.96 --> 4077.839
the illusion i wouldn't call it illusion

4081.44 --> 4085.68
distraction

4082.88 --> 4088.2400000000002
right the only thing that prevents

4085.68 --> 4091.2
true insight true ascension and that

4088.24 --> 4095.52
includes sensory ascension right it's

4091.2 --> 4095.52
not just understanding it's sensory

4097.679 --> 4102.719
and the only way that actually stops you

4100.4 --> 4105.2789999999995
from doing that is distraction on the

4102.719 --> 4107.759
outside and on the inside

4105.279 --> 4110.0
outside distractions you latch onto them

4107.759 --> 4112.56
on the inside and that prevents you

4110.0 --> 4116.239
dissuade you from ascending from going

4112.56 --> 4119.56
further and overcoming it

4116.239 --> 4119.5599999999995
in your mind

4123.359 --> 4128.4800000000005
and what you don't understand

4126.4 --> 4131.48
you fear

4128.48 --> 4131.48
right

4133.199 --> 4137.12
now there are some

4134.719 --> 4140.719
words that have

4137.12 --> 4140.719
extreme implications

4142.56 --> 4145.56
right

4157.92 --> 4164.159
okay michael gunn

4161.04 --> 4166.88
well you're being a sport at least i

4164.159 --> 4168.4
sorry if i'm being very loud about this

4166.88 --> 4170.799
it's just that

4168.4 --> 4172.719
i get very riled up by this whole

4170.799 --> 4173.679
subject

4172.719 --> 4175.52
because

4173.679 --> 4178.96
like to me i

4175.52 --> 4181.679
i have other things in my head

4178.96 --> 4184.2390000000005
right i can't even lay it down i just

4181.679 --> 4186.319
have a idea that

4184.239 --> 4189.759
i'm afraid that good people might

4186.319 --> 4191.6
actually be barred from heaven

4189.759 --> 4193.92
for not ascending

4191.6 --> 4196.320000000001
for holding on to the obstacles and

4193.92 --> 4199.6
believing that those obstacles are the

4196.32 --> 4199.599999999999
key to the gate

4199.76 --> 4203.2390000000005
when they're not

4204.159 --> 4208.239
and i

4205.44 --> 4210.879999999999
yes it's super esoteric but this is kind

4208.239 --> 4213.678999999999
of in my head a belief

4210.88 --> 4217.36
that came from the inside

4213.679 --> 4219.04
a long time ago

4217.36 --> 4221.92
because i really believe that

4219.04 --> 4224.8
understanding is the true key it's the

4221.92 --> 4226.2390000000005
key to ascension and it is potentially

4224.8 --> 4228.64
the ascension

4226.239 --> 4231.28
might be the only true way to actually

4228.64 --> 4232.88
attain that key to get there to go to

4231.28 --> 4235.04
that next level

4232.88 --> 4237.679
and if you don't find it then you

4235.04 --> 4239.76
potentially reincarnate and try again

4237.679 --> 4242.32
and try again until you either find the

4239.76 --> 4244.56
key to heaven or you tumble down into

4242.32 --> 4246.239
the hole of hell and never get out

4244.56 --> 4247.6
or the abyss

4246.239 --> 4249.919999999999
and then you stay in the darkness

4247.6 --> 4252.719
forever

4249.92 --> 4255.6
wondering why you didn't try to get the

4252.719 --> 4255.6
key to heaven

4256.0 --> 4261.84
something like that but that's esoteric

4258.719 --> 4261.84
that's ethereal

4262.239 --> 4267.0
it's not scriptural i know

4272.88 --> 4275.96
all right

4302.159 --> 4305.199
hey youtube what

4306.56 --> 4313.88
i don't what is that like some series

4310.88 --> 4313.88
uh

4314.239 --> 4317.36
i don't watch tv

4326.64 --> 4332.8
right

4329.52 --> 4335.1990000000005
let me try to put it into another

4332.8 --> 4337.679
format to explain what i tried to

4335.199 --> 4339.199
communicate about the fear that if you

4337.679 --> 4340.88
don't overcome the obstacle and you

4339.199 --> 4342.879999999999
think the obstacle is the key to heaven

4340.88 --> 4345.36
then you don't get into heaven that

4342.88 --> 4347.36
might not necessarily mean you go to

4345.36 --> 4350.639999999999
hell instead right might mean

4347.36 --> 4354.159
reincarnate it might also mean

4350.64 --> 4356.56
you go to the sub heaven

4354.159 --> 4358.4
because you can't really

4356.56 --> 4360.96
grip it

4358.4 --> 4363.28
you can't truly wield the power of

4360.96 --> 4365.36
heaven because you didn't get it in

4363.28 --> 4368.08
spirit you didn't grow enough

4365.36 --> 4370.239
so you become like the sub heaven

4368.08 --> 4372.719
and then the real people in heaven will

4370.239 --> 4374.5599999999995
kind of like be your

4372.719 --> 4375.6
overlords you don't really

4374.56 --> 4377.679
rule

4375.6 --> 4379.679
a sense of power in an earthly sense it

4377.679 --> 4381.92
doesn't exist there that would make no

4379.679 --> 4383.84
sense

4381.92 --> 4386.2390000000005
but they would be like the shepherds to

4383.84 --> 4388.88
those

4386.239 --> 4390.639999999999
sub-heaven entries of those that didn't

4388.88 --> 4393.04
kind of intellectually make it that

4390.64 --> 4395.280000000001
didn't truly understand they but they

4393.04 --> 4397.6
were very faithful

4395.28 --> 4399.199
they had a lot of good energy

4397.6 --> 4401.280000000001
but they didn't get it they didn't

4399.199 --> 4403.599999999999
overcome the obstacle right that might

4401.28 --> 4407.04
be a way

4403.6 --> 4408.88
it also happens after death i don't know

4407.04 --> 4411.12
for sure

4408.88 --> 4415.04
i'm always trying to reconstruct things

4411.12 --> 4417.12
in my mind like okay if i was sort of

4415.04 --> 4419.92
god the designer and thinking like a

4417.12 --> 4422.0
designer like how would i arrange it

4419.92 --> 4422.8
what would make true sense

4422.0 --> 4425.92
like

4422.8 --> 4427.6
on the long long on the longest run

4425.92 --> 4430.56
roughly

4427.6 --> 4433.52
and then well this might be a way that

4430.56 --> 4433.52
it would manifest

4433.679 --> 4438.84
i don't know

4435.44 --> 4438.839999999999
it's an idea

4441.04 --> 4446.0
right because i i can't

4443.679 --> 4448.96
truly believe

4446.0 --> 4453.04
that there would be such a clear-cut one

4448.96 --> 4456.4
side or the other side border system

4453.04 --> 4460.0
for heaven hell and the abyss

4456.4 --> 4460.0
and purgatory and all of it

4462.719 --> 4467.52
i kind of believe it's a spectrum and

4464.96 --> 4468.4800000000005
it's kind of like how far you grew in

4467.52 --> 4470.8
spirit

4468.48 --> 4474.5599999999995
and understanding during life

4470.8 --> 4479.04
is like is like literally the level

4474.56 --> 4481.1990000000005
of entry you attain on the other side

4479.04 --> 4484.4
it's direct it should be directly

4481.199 --> 4484.4
proportional to

4485.679 --> 4488.56
yeah to that

4490.08 --> 4494.96
energy frequency wise

4492.8 --> 4497.52
and inside wise

4494.96 --> 4499.36
separately like

4497.52 --> 4502.0
a 2d

4499.36 --> 4502.0
spectrum

4506.159 --> 4511.5199999999995
and then what you attain

4508.239 --> 4512.32
is literally the height

4511.52 --> 4515.4400000000005
of

4512.32 --> 4515.44
the entryway

4516.159 --> 4519.199
does that make sense

4520.32 --> 4525.199
so yeah how how high up

4522.719 --> 4526.88
in the tower of heaven are you going to

4525.199 --> 4529.04
settle in

4526.88 --> 4533.12
isn't that an interesting idea

4529.04 --> 4534.64
tower of heaven and the higher you climb

4533.12 --> 4536.64
during life

4534.64 --> 4540.0
the higher the entry

4536.64 --> 4540.0
becomes available to you

4541.76 --> 4544.96
in a way that would

4543.44 --> 4547.44
to me

4544.96 --> 4552.199
seem just

4547.44 --> 4552.199
and isn't god just above all

4553.679 --> 4557.679
right

4554.8 --> 4559.360000000001
right but this is pretty

4557.679 --> 4560.8
yeah

4559.36 --> 4564.08
esoteric

4560.8 --> 4566.2390000000005
ethereal speculation so

4564.08 --> 4568.159
don't expect anybody to really take this

4566.239 --> 4569.678999999999
super serious what i just tried to

4568.159 --> 4572.719
communicate

4569.679 --> 4572.719
but it is a thought

4575.12 --> 4582.5599999999995
you know and if god must be just

4578.88 --> 4585.12
then if we don't see how he is just

4582.56 --> 4587.360000000001
then we must be overlooking something

4585.12 --> 4590.08
and isn't that already kind of a formula

4587.36 --> 4591.28
that really works well throughout your

4590.08 --> 4593.28
life

4591.28 --> 4595.199
because who hasn't thought at some point

4593.28 --> 4598.48
like during their young years like this

4595.199 --> 4600.48
is injustice how could god do this

4598.48 --> 4603.678999999999
then when you get older you get it you

4600.48 --> 4605.5199999999995
certainly understand what how and why

4603.679 --> 4608.56
this those things kind of happen the way

4605.52 --> 4611.280000000001
they do what they do and

4608.56 --> 4611.280000000001
how every

4612.719 --> 4618.159
seemingly negative thing can

4615.28 --> 4620.4
yield a positive growth right the

4618.159 --> 4622.639999999999
obstacle the tests

4620.4 --> 4625.28
the tests of creation

4622.64 --> 4627.52
kind of to me seems like the purpose

4625.28 --> 4631.92
we're here

4627.52 --> 4631.92
that's the main objective

4634.64 --> 4639.4400000000005
the main source of grow energy as well

4641.36 --> 4644.36
anyway

4660.96 --> 4665.84
dude aries cursor man who do you think

4663.04 --> 4665.84
invented

4666.719 --> 4669.92
the one world government

4675.52 --> 4681.040000000001
who do you think started that

4679.04 --> 4682.48
could it be

4681.04 --> 4683.92
the vatican

4682.48 --> 4687.159
the vatican

4683.92 --> 4687.159
could it

4692.56 --> 4700.400000000001
didn't they kind of do a giant trial run

4696.08 --> 4701.84
during the theocracy age in europe

4700.4 --> 4704.239
didn't they

4701.84 --> 4706.88
kind of try to make a one-world

4704.239 --> 4709.678999999999
government of their own

4706.88 --> 4711.12
ignoring nation states

4709.679 --> 4714.0
even

4711.12 --> 4717.28
trumping kings with their popes and all

4714.0 --> 4719.84
that trying that power play with that

4717.28 --> 4722.239
isn't that kind of like an early run of

4719.84 --> 4725.2390000000005
a one world government

4722.239 --> 4725.239
huh

4743.62 --> 4746.979
[Music]

4754.96 --> 4758.6
hey banjo bear

4764.88 --> 4767.88
okay

4780.4 --> 4785.32
oh by the way hello mandy young good to

4782.159 --> 4785.32
see you

4817.92 --> 4820.4800000000005
what the

4827.679 --> 4829.92
what's

4828.639 --> 4834.4800000000005
that

4829.92 --> 4834.4800000000005
where's that black line on the right

4837.679 --> 4841.2390000000005
what the

4853.84 --> 4856.84
huh

4881.84 --> 4887.1990000000005
yeah i know right

4884.48 --> 4891.678999999999
old house rod bound

4887.199 --> 4891.678999999999
rodborn welcome to chat by the way

4895.199 --> 4899.04
but seriously i think that actually what

4897.84 --> 4901.04
they did

4899.04 --> 4903.5199999999995
with chris in them

4901.04 --> 4906.96
with jesus's magnificent teachings is

4903.52 --> 4911.1990000000005
they tried to make the first

4906.96 --> 4911.199
kind of like a world government with it

4912.8 --> 4917.679
and then they switched it inside out

4916.239 --> 4921.5199999999995
themselves

4917.679 --> 4921.52
and they made atheism

4922.48 --> 4925.799999999999
and the globe

4931.199 --> 4934.799999999999
like

4932.96 --> 4937.92
just look at where the big bang theory

4934.8 --> 4937.92
came from who made that

4938.0 --> 4941.04
right

4939.199 --> 4943.199
in the 60s

4941.04 --> 4946.88
the 1960s

4943.199 --> 4949.199
right so where did all that come from

4946.88 --> 4952.32
the same group

4949.199 --> 4953.759999999999
same group of same organization bringing

4952.32 --> 4955.04
out

4953.76 --> 4958.04
modern

4955.04 --> 4958.04
atheism

4960.8 --> 4966.88
and the globe cosmology and everything

4963.28 --> 4966.88
that's tied into that

4968.0 --> 4972.32
right they like to tell you in history

4970.4 --> 4975.5199999999995
like oh

4972.32 --> 4978.48
oh they did you was interested oh they

4975.52 --> 4982.719
were persecuted by the church and

4978.48 --> 4984.638999999999
oh they were so much trouble oh really

4982.719 --> 4987.12
or

4984.639 --> 4989.92
it was kind of a controlled opposition

4987.12 --> 4993.04
introduction like oh we are against the

4989.92 --> 4995.1990000000005
old paradigm ooh you're bad you're a bad

4993.04 --> 4996.719
boy naughty naughty boy

4995.199 --> 5000.239
and then everybody's like oh these

4996.719 --> 5002.2390000000005
people they don't give a [ __ ]

5000.239 --> 5004.718999999999
that this is very oversimplified but i

5002.239 --> 5007.12
think that

5004.719 --> 5009.84
that heliocentrism cosmology and all

5007.12 --> 5012.08
that was actively introduced

5009.84 --> 5012.08
by

5012.159 --> 5017.04
by the vatican

5013.6 --> 5018.639
it's very rough pinpointing

5017.04 --> 5020.32
it's not as simple as that but

5018.639 --> 5022.4800000000005
effectively

5020.32 --> 5025.44
i think they introduced it

5022.48 --> 5029.839999999999
then they also kind of worked against it

5025.44 --> 5029.839999999999
a little to make it more

5030.56 --> 5035.76
seeming like a naturally

5033.6 --> 5038.320000000001
occurring revolution

5035.76 --> 5040.08
spiritual revolution against the church

5038.32 --> 5041.759999999999
they created their own controlled

5040.08 --> 5044.4
opposition

5041.76 --> 5047.12
to take over

5044.4 --> 5049.599999999999
for the yeah for the new program the new

5047.12 --> 5053.36
world religion the occult religion where

5049.6 --> 5053.360000000001
the people don't know it's a religion

5054.4 --> 5059.5199999999995
it comes from the same group

5056.56 --> 5062.400000000001
the same group that effectively made

5059.52 --> 5064.0
modern or yeah the christianity into

5062.4 --> 5066.239
what it is

5064.0 --> 5068.0
completely counter opposite to what it

5066.239 --> 5069.678999999999
should be according to christ's own

5068.0 --> 5070.639
teachings

5069.679 --> 5073.6
right

5070.639 --> 5076.719
those same people that did that

5073.6 --> 5079.679
and trial runs world government with it

5076.719 --> 5081.84
in medieval times and beyond

5079.679 --> 5085.28
they also

5081.84 --> 5087.6
started up the exact opposite

5085.28 --> 5089.12
the inside out universe where there is

5087.6 --> 5090.159000000001
no god

5089.12 --> 5091.599999999999
and where

5090.159 --> 5093.839999999999
everything is endless and we're all

5091.6 --> 5096.0
insignificant in evolution and all that

5093.84 --> 5098.639
nonsense that came from it

5096.0 --> 5100.0
it's the same group that created all

5098.639 --> 5104.639
that

5100.0 --> 5106.159
in a controlled oppositional startup

5104.639 --> 5107.04
right

5106.159 --> 5110.0
and

5107.04 --> 5112.719
the same group is the ones now working

5110.0 --> 5116.0
on that cosmology

5112.719 --> 5121.2390000000005
as they were before 500 years ago

5116.0 --> 5121.239
working on the christian cosmology

5128.32 --> 5133.5199999999995
does that make any sense

5130.4 --> 5133.5199999999995
what i'm saying right now

5137.84 --> 5143.1990000000005
i think it does but it might be very

5140.8 --> 5145.84
oversimplified the way that i presented

5143.199 --> 5148.32
it it's just such a complex big thing

5145.84 --> 5151.679
that happened

5148.32 --> 5155.84
but i i truly believe that i put it down

5151.679 --> 5155.84
accurately in rough terms

5156.56 --> 5161.1990000000005
like the vatican and the catholic church

5158.32 --> 5163.28
effectively did create atheism as the

5161.199 --> 5166.4
new world religion

5163.28 --> 5169.84
with everything that's on top of that

5166.4 --> 5169.839999999999
they started it up

5195.52 --> 5203.1990000000005
right okay erase cursive man what

5199.92 --> 5203.1990000000005
different bible versions

5207.199 --> 5215.28
kgv only for you okay well

5211.6 --> 5217.4400000000005
did you know that king james

5215.28 --> 5219.12
it's a great likelihood he was actually

5217.44 --> 5221.759999999999
a transvestite

5219.12 --> 5221.76
secretly

5222.159 --> 5225.04
did you know that

5227.679 --> 5233.52
but seriously there's a lot wrong with

5229.6 --> 5233.52
the king james version there is

5233.84 --> 5236.84
like

5238.4 --> 5245.36
king james in his own way

5241.76 --> 5249.52
did something very similar to when

5245.36 --> 5250.639
that emperor of rome wasn't constantine

5249.52 --> 5253.92
made

5250.639 --> 5256.56
christianity into the empire religion

5253.92 --> 5259.1990000000005
all of a sudden it's a very similar

5256.56 --> 5260.4800000000005
feeling move like altering it but in a

5259.199 --> 5263.04
way that

5260.48 --> 5264.239
would work very well for

5263.04 --> 5267.12
that

5264.239 --> 5270.239
current empire

5267.12 --> 5274.32
i think that's what king james did

5270.239 --> 5274.32
when he made his version of the bible

5274.719 --> 5281.4
but the man was anything but a saint

5277.28 --> 5281.4
okay he really wasn't

5291.04 --> 5297.28
no versions accepting case

5293.76 --> 5297.280000000001
yeah but that's what dude

5297.76 --> 5302.56
that's freaky by the way but yeah if

5300.239 --> 5303.678999999999
people make that make the bible like

5302.56 --> 5305.6
that yeah

5303.679 --> 5307.76
then they make it like that doesn't make

5305.6 --> 5309.84
it correct though but yeah what are you

5307.76 --> 5314.2390000000005
gonna do

5309.84 --> 5314.2390000000005
changing the words of jesus that is evil

5314.8 --> 5319.6
that is

5316.08 --> 5322.719
that is truly corrupt

5319.6 --> 5324.0
you're gonna change the words jesus

5322.719 --> 5326.159
it becomes

5324.0 --> 5330.04
like you should burn it

5326.159 --> 5330.04
you should burn that book

5338.48 --> 5343.44
i'm not saying you have to do that but

5341.36 --> 5345.44
symbolically like

5343.44 --> 5346.4
if you're gonna change the word to jesus

5345.44 --> 5350.839999999999
yeah

5346.4 --> 5350.839999999999
then what do you got left you know

5350.88 --> 5356.6
anyway i'll be back two minutes

5353.199 --> 5356.599999999999
hang in there

5371.84 --> 5374.84
so

5389.12 --> 5392.12
so

5449.76 --> 5454.719
oh my god

5452.48 --> 5456.5599999999995
well aries christman

5454.719 --> 5458.719
dude

5456.56 --> 5460.8
if they have lgbtq

5458.719 --> 5464.159
bibles now

5460.8 --> 5466.2390000000005
that's cute don't mind if i don't go go

5464.159 --> 5467.04
to those churches

5466.239 --> 5468.48
that

5467.04 --> 5470.32
well

5468.48 --> 5473.32
should you even call them churches you

5470.32 --> 5473.32
know

5476.08 --> 5479.08
god

5502.719 --> 5505.719
me

5513.12 --> 5516.5599999999995
well that's a very esoteric statement

5515.199 --> 5518.879999999999
there

5516.56 --> 5520.88
gaining wisdom from the moment the truth

5518.88 --> 5523.1990000000005
left this world the church was corrupted

5520.88 --> 5523.1990000000005
