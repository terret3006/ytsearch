there's not a lot of strong wind but

127.36 --> 134.16
there's still some and

128.879 --> 137.92
yeah still pretty okay

134.16 --> 137.92
and i don't know it might clear up

140.84 --> 146.64000000000001
somewhere

142.879 --> 146.64
right so

147.12 --> 150.56
it's thursday

151.12 --> 161.04
the 4th of march 2021

156.48 --> 161.04
i got my coffee still because

164.16 --> 168.07999999999998
i woke up really late it was kind of

166.08 --> 171.84
bizarre

168.08 --> 171.84
i thought that it was earlier but

172.0 --> 177.44
i slept in quite a bit

175.519 --> 179.20000000000002
but then again i also went to bed kind

177.44 --> 180.8
of late this time

179.2 --> 183.28
it was just a whole bunch of things

180.8 --> 187.04000000000002
happening and kind of made me

183.28 --> 187.04
a little bit restless kept me up

196.319 --> 200.23899999999998
hello tom parker by the way first in

210.84 --> 213.84
chat

215.2 --> 219.11999999999998
letters debates yesterday was pretty

216.879 --> 219.12
good

225.36 --> 229.44000000000003
yeah and it like man

229.599 --> 233.83999999999997
i did my news for a paper round at some

231.84 --> 236.159
point but when i came back

233.84 --> 238.239
the guys were still going like after the

236.159 --> 242.0
after show was over

238.239 --> 246.0
and that kept on going until

242.0 --> 250.56
was it almost like eight o'clock my time

246.0 --> 253.2
and yeah uh tony was having a sort of an

250.56 --> 253.2
integral

253.439 --> 258.799
medical slash legal discussion with adam

257.44 --> 261.919
meakin and that lasted

258.799 --> 264.23999999999995
very long and they was yeah it was very

261.919 --> 266.0
interesting

264.24 --> 267.6
to listen to that even though i missed a

266.0 --> 270.08
big chunk of it because i was doing

267.6 --> 270.08000000000004
other stuff

271.84 --> 276.63899999999995
but yeah it was about some detail about

276.24 --> 279.199
some

276.639 --> 281.199
yeah tony was going back and forth with

279.199 --> 285.199
somebody

281.199 --> 287.44
and uh i wonder what will come out of

285.199 --> 287.44
that

288.639 --> 293.199
yeah by the way for those who haven't

290.56 --> 294.96
caught on tony anthony riley sleeping

293.199 --> 299.44
warriors channel has been just

294.96 --> 299.44
deleted by youtube

301.039 --> 303.84
pretty shocking

306.0 --> 325.84
hello christian kumar

310.0 --> 325.84
my god tiny wombo dutch sailor

332.4 --> 339.12
uh yeah christian kumar there's no real

335.68 --> 341.759
groundbreaking evidence for a flat earth

339.12 --> 343.759
because all of it's already out there we

341.759 --> 353.84000000000003
don't need any more proof

343.759 --> 353.84000000000003
we just know it's flat

364.84 --> 369.039
um i know

366.72 --> 370.47900000000004
in france i know you're very petty i

369.039 --> 372.96
know

370.479 --> 375.12
i know that autocratic top-down

372.96 --> 378.4
censorship

375.12 --> 381.84000000000003
is the only savior you have left

378.4 --> 381.84
i know

382.16 --> 385.759
it's very revealing isn't it

391.68 --> 396.72
which one of the three what

396.96 --> 400.96
oh there's only three models now are

399.28 --> 404.31899999999996
they

400.96 --> 408.4
really i didn't know there were three

404.319 --> 423.84000000000003
models as far as i'm concerned there's

408.4 --> 423.84
just endless amounts of options

435.599 --> 443.44
anti-vaxx rhetoric and up next

440.4 --> 446.15999999999997
now that that's not how that works and

443.44 --> 448.24
anti-vaxx censorship has been happening

446.16 --> 452.96000000000004
for a long time

448.24 --> 455.52
they've been compartmentalized

452.96 --> 456.4
even like that's been cracked down on

455.52 --> 460.31899999999996
even before

456.4 --> 460.31899999999996
flat earth kind of came onto the scene

462.84 --> 466.08
so

464.0 --> 468.879
but they still keep popping up they have

466.08 --> 468.87899999999996
their own circuit

469.039 --> 479.84
some of them out there that have been

470.479 --> 479.84
going at it for a long time

504.84 --> 507.84
hmm

509.039 --> 514.159
another side what other side

514.32 --> 521.6800000000001
who's to say you you can get there

518.159 --> 524.8
i i think you've you're caught into a

521.68 --> 528.0799999999999
physicality assumption bias based

524.8 --> 530.56
effect christian kumar

528.08 --> 532.72
where you're basically thinking through

530.56 --> 535.92
the imagery

532.72 --> 536.48
like oh so the earth is flat so it's

535.92 --> 541.04
flat

536.48 --> 544.399
in space no no the underside is not

541.04 --> 545.76
is not in reach can't just go to the

544.399 --> 549.2
underside

545.76 --> 552.64
yeah physicality assumption bias

549.2 --> 556.8000000000001
it's a psychological effect where you

552.64 --> 560.72
try to make things you see into

556.8 --> 560.7199999999999
a tangible form in your mind

561.12 --> 565.36
and that is a bias you know it also

563.68 --> 569.1999999999999
applies to heavenly bodies

565.36 --> 572.72
it's just a bias that because you could

569.2 --> 577.839
conceive of them as a physical object

572.72 --> 577.839
that they must be so

607.519 --> 613.04
wow so that's what you're going to do

610.959 --> 616.4799999999999
now you're just going to create a

613.04 --> 618.56
a ridicule ridiculous straw man version

616.48 --> 624.0
of the flat earth

618.56 --> 633.8389999999999
model and then start to make fun of that

624.0 --> 633.839
that's what's left for you

652.64 --> 656.88
yeah my god they are struggling a lot

657.68 --> 661.4399999999999
i know they're going through some

660.56 --> 664.079
serious [ __ ]

661.44 --> 664.0790000000001
in their heads

664.48 --> 668.0
and the only way out they can find for

667.2 --> 670.399
themselves

668.0 --> 671.44
is to just quickly hop over to a flat

670.399 --> 675.36
earther and just

671.44 --> 677.6800000000001
nag them so they don't have to feel

675.36 --> 680.0
i don't have to use their focus on their

677.68 --> 683.1999999999999
feelings so much

680.0 --> 685.6
because it's really shitty there because

683.2 --> 688.8000000000001
they've lost

685.6 --> 692.5600000000001
and they're not being given

688.8 --> 694.7199999999999
the illusion that oh yeah it's okay

692.56 --> 696.4799999999999
you can think of that you've won they're

694.72 --> 700.5600000000001
not getting that

696.48 --> 703.9200000000001
from us so they just start to nag

700.56 --> 707.68
you know i don't go up

703.92 --> 707.68
to their hangouts

708.079 --> 712.4799999999999
and start nagging them

711.12 --> 714.399
you know there's other flat earthers

712.48 --> 717.6
that do do that and hey

714.399 --> 719.44
at times sometimes it's like sometimes

717.6 --> 721.12
you gotta do it sometimes especially

719.44 --> 724.72
when

721.12 --> 726.88
there's yeah baller religious

724.72 --> 729.6
streamers out there that are being

726.88 --> 731.04
really like oh we're so great and oh the

729.6 --> 732.0
flat earthers are so stupid yeah if

731.04 --> 734.639
you're gonna do that

732.0 --> 736.959
then i'm gonna pop up and basically

734.639 --> 739.279
smack down some real facts

736.959 --> 741.5189999999999
remind you about certain things that you

739.279 --> 744.32
would like to forget

741.519 --> 745.36
right but other than that we don't and

744.32 --> 748.399
go and

745.36 --> 749.12
stalk people by calling them up on their

748.399 --> 752.88
phones

749.12 --> 755.519
just to bully them right

752.88 --> 759.2
that's the difference i don't know any

755.519 --> 761.279
flat earthers that do that

759.2 --> 763.279
heard any baller complaints about how

761.279 --> 768.48
they're constantly being called up

763.279 --> 768.48
by flat earthers were bullying them

770.16 --> 776.399
no you don't know any of those

773.36 --> 779.44
oh why would that be

776.399 --> 780.48
could it be because flat earthers don't

779.44 --> 783.0400000000001
have

780.48 --> 785.279
pain in their heart from their inability

783.04 --> 787.5999999999999
to confront themselves with blatant lies

785.279 --> 791.279
that are open for everyone to see

787.6 --> 792.399
that we can deal with yeah because we

791.279 --> 801.8389999999999
don't have that

792.399 --> 801.839
because we're on the other side

809.519 --> 816.48
d day fraction

813.44 --> 821.9200000000001
do you mean die fraction i don't know

816.48 --> 821.9200000000001
what d fraction is in that sense

823.6 --> 830.24
but if you mean optics based diffraction

827.199 --> 832.639
yeah i've ever of a rough idea of what

830.24 --> 832.639
that is

833.12 --> 837.92
but it's it's quite elusive to me though

835.44 --> 840.48
i know the rough structures but

837.92 --> 841.04
depending i like every time i really

840.48 --> 843.519
need to

841.04 --> 845.8389999999999
put things down concerning optics i

843.519 --> 848.8
really like need a moment to get

845.839 --> 849.36
to get back into it because optics are

848.8 --> 852.959
difficult

849.36 --> 856.9590000000001
always have been to me but i have

852.959 --> 871.8389999999999
made a a little model for that

856.959 --> 871.8389999999999
the eyeball and stick graph

873.519 --> 876.88
i have been attacked one time dutch

875.68 --> 881.76
sailor what

876.88 --> 885.8389999999999
no i've never been a flat earth or like

881.76 --> 885.8389999999999
somebody physically attacking me no

888.0 --> 891.92
but i have been doxxed in the past

892.24 --> 897.279
then again it's like yeah

895.36 --> 899.839
it's kind of ridiculous to try and

897.279 --> 902.8
prevent being dogs when you're being so

899.839 --> 902.8000000000001
open and honest

903.36 --> 906.24
about yourself

907.839 --> 911.0400000000001
because people are gonna do that they're

909.44 --> 914.0
gonna find out and in a way

911.04 --> 914.7199999999999
it's like no i i want i want it to be

914.0 --> 918.48
known

914.72 --> 920.88
where i am like because hey

918.48 --> 922.399
it there might be something you want to

920.88 --> 924.639
share with me

922.399 --> 926.399
or you might have questions or you might

924.639 --> 927.92
want to know about something really

926.399 --> 930.8
complicated that

927.92 --> 934.3199999999999
you've walked around with all your life

930.8 --> 937.279
and everybody just thinks you're crazy

934.32 --> 938.399
and hey maybe you are crazy but if you

937.279 --> 941.199
are

938.399 --> 943.6
then i'll still find i will still be

941.199 --> 947.4399999999999
able to find out

943.6 --> 950.16
what of the thing that's in you

947.44 --> 952.839
is you being crazy and what might be an

950.16 --> 956.24
actual thing

952.839 --> 957.2790000000001
right i'm i happen to be very good at

956.24 --> 960.9590000000001
that

957.279 --> 964.16
and i've i dove into quite a few people

960.959 --> 967.199
very mentally plagued people and

964.16 --> 970.399
people that are very mentally still but

967.199 --> 971.3599999999999
all people have unusual experiences

970.399 --> 975.199
sometime and

971.36 --> 978.88
and they tend to really hang in there

975.199 --> 982.0
very deeply and people yeah you can't

978.88 --> 984.0
people on average are very superficial

982.0 --> 986.24
so they just start to ignore you

984.0 --> 989.12
whenever you

986.24 --> 990.48
want to share something really unusual

989.12 --> 991.36
it's always been like that but it's

990.48 --> 993.6800000000001
getting worse

991.36 --> 995.04
because people are on average just more

993.68 --> 997.12
hiding

995.04 --> 999.36
mentally because the world is going

997.12 --> 1000.639
crazy and they can't handle being

999.36 --> 1011.36
conscious about that

1000.639 --> 1014.8
so they retract on average

1011.36 --> 1014.8000000000001
it's flurry respective

1015.839 --> 1022.839
yeah at least it's not blur perspective

1019.36 --> 1025.52
because that now that's really

1022.839 --> 1029.52
ridiculous

1025.52 --> 1033.039
blur perspective it's the weird

1029.52 --> 1036.0
autographic view that's blur perspective

1033.039 --> 1036.0
now that's weird

1037.52 --> 1043.039
can you imagine just site itself that

1039.76 --> 1045.36
you would see everything parallel

1043.039 --> 1047.76
and things wouldn't get smaller as you

1045.36 --> 1051.12
look into the distance

1047.76 --> 1053.52
it's a pretty bizarre if yeah if that

1051.12 --> 1055.52
were somehow possible that you could

1053.52 --> 1056.96
see the light doesn't work that way you

1055.52 --> 1060.559
know because light is involved

1056.96 --> 1061.8400000000001
perspective always but could you just

1060.559 --> 1064.72
imagine like you would

1061.84 --> 1067.52
literally see just perfectly parallel so

1064.72 --> 1070.799
it would be like a perfect

1067.52 --> 1071.679
cross shot of all things in a certain

1070.799 --> 1074.0
dimension

1071.679 --> 1074.96
as you would see it that's blur

1074.0 --> 1078.08
perspective

1074.96 --> 1080.88
right oh that's weird a perspective is

1078.08 --> 1085.9189999999999
the only thing where you can kind of

1080.88 --> 1085.919
see and calculate a curve with the sides

1086.96 --> 1093.039
right because if you actually us

1090.64 --> 1093.76
apply fleur spective the real

1093.039 --> 1096.16
perspective

1093.76 --> 1098.24
then suddenly oh yeah now yeah that's

1096.16 --> 1100.3200000000002
not really the curve then

1098.24 --> 1102.799
huh it's just perspective making things

1100.32 --> 1102.799
smaller

1120.84 --> 1123.84
what

1125.679 --> 1137.8400000000001
flat earth people no more than the

1127.6 --> 1137.84
illuminati one

1139.919 --> 1145.6000000000001
flat earthers just i don't know

1143.12 --> 1148.6399999999999
i think on average know enough to know

1145.6 --> 1151.84
that they know very little

1148.64 --> 1154.88
and probably so do the elite

1151.84 --> 1154.8799999999999
the illuminati

1162.84 --> 1179.84
agm

1165.039 --> 1179.84
there is no big fire

1189.2 --> 1196.0
ah rufus and hobbits not i'm gonna be

1192.88 --> 1198.0
pedantic technically you do still

1196.0 --> 1199.52
kind of feel movement without

1198.0 --> 1201.6
acceleration

1199.52 --> 1204.0
because of the vibration that usually

1201.6 --> 1206.0
comes you know the friction

1204.0 --> 1208.4
something is moving even at a constant

1206.0 --> 1212.32
rate unless they're in a vacuum

1208.4 --> 1213.8400000000001
which just doesn't happen in nature

1212.32 --> 1215.6
there's going to be some kind of a

1213.84 --> 1218.72
friction

1215.6 --> 1221.6789999999999
and friction typically

1218.72 --> 1223.039
may cause for example oscillation of the

1221.679 --> 1225.2800000000002
body

1223.039 --> 1227.52
that is moving right so even the

1225.28 --> 1228.1589999999999
acceleration literally applies that

1227.52 --> 1230.0
force

1228.159 --> 1231.3600000000001
that you could then feel like pressing

1230.0 --> 1233.12
from a direction

1231.36 --> 1234.8799999999999
but even if you're moving at a constant

1233.12 --> 1238.1589999999999
rate like you

1234.88 --> 1241.0390000000002
know when you're in a car

1238.159 --> 1241.919
that's standing still and you know when

1241.039 --> 1244.24
you're in a car

1241.919 --> 1246.0
that's moving at a steady speed even

1244.24 --> 1247.76
blindfolded

1246.0 --> 1249.44
and you would even know if you're in a

1247.76 --> 1252.08
car on a moving train

1249.44 --> 1253.76
you know why because you can feel

1252.08 --> 1256.559
vibrations

1253.76 --> 1263.84
it has to do with oscillation haha so

1256.559 --> 1263.84
there you go

1273.76 --> 1277.2
friction in an even movement yeah but

1276.64 --> 1281.5200000000002
the

1277.2 --> 1284.48
in only frictionless movement

1281.52 --> 1291.679
that that only really happens in theory

1284.48 --> 1293.6
tiny bumble that's the point

1291.679 --> 1295.44
like if somebody's going to ask like oh

1293.6 --> 1297.36
how are you going to feel it

1295.44 --> 1298.64
right well feeling is something that

1297.36 --> 1302.24
happens in the physical

1298.64 --> 1303.3600000000001
real world our senses so i'm not going

1302.24 --> 1306.32
to

1303.36 --> 1306.799
assume that question was how would it

1306.32 --> 1310.08
feel

1306.799 --> 1311.84
in theory right no

1310.08 --> 1313.36
that's not how i'm going to interpret it

1311.84 --> 1315.1999999999998
so then i'm going to drag in

1313.36 --> 1316.7199999999998
the things that are always going to be

1315.2 --> 1319.44
there in nature

1316.72 --> 1321.3600000000001
like friction that may cause oscillation

1319.44 --> 1324.24
and that is the secondary way how you

1321.36 --> 1324.24
detect movement

1330.799 --> 1334.6399999999999
oh shut up dr gonzo

1342.559 --> 1347.84
i'm not going to do drugs with japanese

1345.28 --> 1347.84
billionaires

1358.84 --> 1361.84
thanks

1372.559 --> 1379.6789999999999
only friction you feel from tires

1376.72 --> 1379.679
that's not true

1384.159 --> 1389.8400000000001
oh right whatever

1387.6 --> 1389.84
anyway

1396.72 --> 1402.559
derek's what are you talking with dude

1399.6 --> 1407.4399999999998
don't be so triggered dr gonzo

1402.559 --> 1411.9189999999999
don't be so triggered space is fake

1407.44 --> 1411.919
it's physically impossible right

1414.88 --> 1421.679
the moon is not a body

1418.0 --> 1424.72
of matter floating in a vacuum

1421.679 --> 1431.8400000000001
in proximity to our ball body of matter

1424.72 --> 1431.84
that we're supposedly standing on

1435.2 --> 1442.0800000000002
dude dr gonzo have you ever taken a look

1438.4 --> 1443.039
at the photo photography and potentially

1442.08 --> 1445.6789999999999
footage of

1443.039 --> 1446.24
the freaking ice wall and like on top of

1445.679 --> 1448.5590000000002
it

1446.24 --> 1450.48
the plateau the eye split have you ever

1448.559 --> 1453.84
seen how unbelievably

1450.48 --> 1454.48
freaking flat that is that's like a a

1453.84 --> 1458.0
nice

1454.48 --> 1459.84
desert out there endless

1458.0 --> 1461.6
it would literally just stretch on

1459.84 --> 1465.76
almost like

1461.6 --> 1466.24
like a like the ice plateau when i saw

1465.76 --> 1470.84
that

1466.24 --> 1472.4
what it first reminded me of seriously

1470.84 --> 1476.3999999999999
was

1472.4 --> 1479.52
like in in 3d rendering programs

1476.4 --> 1482.88
even that i used that

1479.52 --> 1485.6
like yeah in the virtual mechanics of

1482.88 --> 1486.0800000000002
3d rendering it's just wireframes and

1485.6 --> 1488.48
you can

1486.08 --> 1489.1999999999998
have an endless plane literally it's

1488.48 --> 1491.84
just like no

1489.2 --> 1494.4
this is an endless plane it's just how

1491.84 --> 1496.1589999999999
it works out in that system

1494.4 --> 1499.44
and that's kind of what it reminded me

1496.159 --> 1502.3200000000002
of it's like jesus it's so

1499.44 --> 1504.0
it's just endless how it looked anyway

1502.32 --> 1507.279
it's incredibly far

1504.0 --> 1511.6
you can see on there

1507.279 --> 1514.159
right so on top of the ice wall

1511.6 --> 1514.9599999999998
you know the ice wall itself you see it

1514.159 --> 1517.3600000000001
you see it

1514.96 --> 1519.44
stretching up there so then you get

1517.36 --> 1520.32
closer and you get on top of it and then

1519.44 --> 1523.3600000000001
you look

1520.32 --> 1526.84
over that that's that's

1523.36 --> 1529.84
crazy far and flat

1526.84 --> 1529.84
crazy

1544.799 --> 1548.24
hello foul and buchanan

1555.039 --> 1558.799
oh jose bloomington yes

1559.679 --> 1563.2
that's yeah now tony's just getting

1561.84 --> 1566.3999999999999
cracked down upon and

1563.2 --> 1569.8400000000001
i i i don't really

1566.4 --> 1573.2
understand why but

1569.84 --> 1573.1999999999998
maybe it's because of the

1574.72 --> 1579.679
i guess this slightly more pushy tone

1577.12 --> 1585.84
it's just tony you know tony's tony

1579.679 --> 1585.8400000000001
and tony has tony style humor

1586.96 --> 1592.4
yeah but i think it was that i think

1590.96 --> 1595.679
that that video of

1592.4 --> 1598.88
the the guy's bed exploding

1595.679 --> 1601.76
in a practical joke i think that it was

1598.88 --> 1603.279
sized up by some really oversensitive

1601.76 --> 1605.12
people

1603.279 --> 1606.72
it's like oh this is violence and i

1605.12 --> 1608.4799999999998
think that they just

1606.72 --> 1610.24
squirted themselves out of control and

1608.48 --> 1612.08
then it was decided oh this guy is

1610.24 --> 1615.36
actually evil or so i don't know it's

1612.08 --> 1617.52
it seemed absolutely ridiculous

1615.36 --> 1618.3999999999999
because yeah it was a bit of a rough

1617.52 --> 1620.24
thing

1618.4 --> 1621.76
but it didn't seem like the guy wasn't

1620.24 --> 1626.0
hurt

1621.76 --> 1628.96
shocked and that was part of the point

1626.0 --> 1628.96
as a metaphor

1630.72 --> 1636.24
so yeah it is ridiculous it's very

1633.44 --> 1639.039
childish that they did that

1636.24 --> 1641.6
and also the result of it is that tony

1639.039 --> 1645.12
seems to be more invigorated than ever

1641.6 --> 1648.6399999999999
right so there you go it's like

1645.12 --> 1651.76
a little piece of a sort of a more

1648.64 --> 1654.3990000000001
spiritual troll part of tony

1651.76 --> 1654.8799999999999
that is always poking the wider world in

1654.399 --> 1658.8799999999999
a way

1654.88 --> 1660.7990000000002
very carefully yeah he

1658.88 --> 1662.0
the world out there just troll baited

1660.799 --> 1665.12
him

1662.0 --> 1665.76
like he did this thing they took the

1665.12 --> 1669.36
bait

1665.76 --> 1672.24
they censored him and now he's like yeah

1669.36 --> 1672.9599999999998
right now that trollish part about him

1672.24 --> 1676.64
is only

1672.96 --> 1679.44
invigorated because his test

1676.64 --> 1681.279
had basically succeeded like a test

1679.44 --> 1683.679
that's really

1681.279 --> 1686.32
subconscious it doesn't even have to do

1683.679 --> 1690.72
with the material he's treating

1686.32 --> 1693.2
right it's a spiritual test so

1690.72 --> 1694.96
that's what that is like he's more

1693.2 --> 1696.64
invigorated than ever

1694.96 --> 1698.72
from what i heard yesterday he wouldn't

1696.64 --> 1700.0
shut up we just keep on talking talking

1698.72 --> 1702.96
talking because it just

1700.0 --> 1702.96
pumped with energy

1705.919 --> 1709.3600000000001
so definitely not the last time we're

1708.559 --> 1713.44
gonna see

1709.36 --> 1713.4399999999998
him do stuff on the internet

1719.44 --> 1725.8400000000001
right rufus ain't hobbits that's yeah

1721.36 --> 1725.84
that's fine

1727.76 --> 1731.2
now look if i didn't know sleeping

1730.399 --> 1733.4399999999998
warrior

1731.2 --> 1735.2
then i probably wouldn't be all that big

1733.44 --> 1738.0
a fan of him either

1735.2 --> 1740.159
but i just like i've known him for a

1738.0 --> 1743.76
long time and we shared some really

1740.159 --> 1747.2
personal moments and feelings

1743.76 --> 1750.08
like he gets and trusts me

1747.2 --> 1751.3600000000001
and like i have to honor that this is

1750.08 --> 1754.399
rare

1751.36 --> 1757.12
that it like really for real and he's

1754.399 --> 1760.399
tried like his

1757.12 --> 1762.6399999999999
uh he called it bro brawling and i

1760.399 --> 1765.039
haven't always responded too well to it

1762.64 --> 1766.159
been a little defensive sometimes and

1765.039 --> 1768.32
then it's like oh it's

1766.159 --> 1769.3600000000001
because he's dutch he doesn't get it

1768.32 --> 1773.279
yeah

1769.36 --> 1776.399
that's right but yeah i really

1773.279 --> 1781.84
appreciate his presence in the group and

1776.399 --> 1781.84
his activity and his mind how he thinks

1785.12 --> 1789.6789999999999
no doctor gonzo no you're not gonna sign

1787.919 --> 1795.8400000000001
me up

1789.679 --> 1795.8400000000001
that's not even possible anyway

1796.96 --> 1809.8400000000001
because you can't really sign anybody

1798.88 --> 1809.8400000000001
else up that's ridiculous

1814.62 --> 1817.9099999999999
[Music]

1820.84 --> 1823.84
so

1832.64 --> 1838.3990000000001
smart tvs youtube being available from

1835.84 --> 1841.6789999999999
the tv

1838.399 --> 1845.9189999999999
well not as a standard violin vocabulary

1841.679 --> 1848.0
it's not standard i mean there are some

1845.919 --> 1849.679
systems where they are yeah have been

1848.0 --> 1853.919
able to graft

1849.679 --> 1853.919
youtube and other internet even into

1854.799 --> 1861.6
into regular tv sources like even the

1858.24 --> 1865.039
uh the what is it again the modified

1861.6 --> 1866.8799999999999
xbox the old xbox

1865.039 --> 1868.72
somebody built a system for that where

1866.88 --> 1870.72
you can literally just plug it into the

1868.72 --> 1874.32
internet and then

1870.72 --> 1877.3600000000001
get pretty much any type of media

1874.32 --> 1882.0
from tv channels live

1877.36 --> 1886.32
to just databases of videos

1882.0 --> 1886.32
and youtube channels just like that

1886.799 --> 1890.72
but that's that's not standardized

1888.88 --> 1894.24
though it's possible

1890.72 --> 1898.96
it's not standardized so youtube is

1894.24 --> 1907.84
not standard standard available on tv

1898.96 --> 1907.8400000000001
i don't think so

1942.88 --> 1950.24
dr gunzo just piss off okay

1947.519 --> 1951.1200000000001
i'm not going to go on some stupid

1950.24 --> 1954.24
little space

1951.12 --> 1957.4399999999998
program thingy whatever

1954.24 --> 1963.84
to prove the earth is flat just [ __ ] off

1957.44 --> 1963.8400000000001
okay how about that

1966.799 --> 1971.679
i don't give a [ __ ] about a larger

1969.84 --> 1974.24
following

1971.679 --> 1975.679
i'm not going to do that so just [ __ ]

1974.24 --> 1978.559
off

1975.679 --> 1979.44
yeah i really think i'm gonna go to

1978.559 --> 1981.2
japan

1979.44 --> 1983.279
for something like that and go through

1981.2 --> 1985.44
all that [ __ ] probably be forced to take

1983.279 --> 1987.039
some corona vaccine or couldn't even get

1985.44 --> 1991.8400000000001
there

1987.039 --> 1991.84
i'm not gonna do that so [ __ ] off

2004.799 --> 2008.0
oh you don't understand i just told you

2007.6 --> 2009.4399999999998
why

2008.0 --> 2013.84
if you don't understand that then you're

2009.44 --> 2013.8400000000001
just [ __ ] so just shut up

2015.76 --> 2021.12
i'm not going anywhere for a while just

2019.279 --> 2022.799
i'll be happy to be able to maneuver

2021.12 --> 2023.9189999999999
around in the netherlands okay and the

2022.799 --> 2027.44
rest of europe

2023.919 --> 2027.44
i'm not going to japan

2029.2 --> 2047.8400000000001
or the usa not going there

2032.96 --> 2047.8400000000001
not for a while

2050.48 --> 2055.2
now i'm not really interested to roll

2053.44 --> 2058.56
into some program

2055.2 --> 2060.0
and be subjected to that all that [ __ ]

2058.56 --> 2062.879
out there

2060.0 --> 2065.599
just to satisfy a bunch of squirt boys

2062.879 --> 2065.5989999999997
in my chat

2066.079 --> 2070.159
yeah inifranza that's that's not what i

stop trying to make me do [ __ ] i don't

2105.44 --> 2117.839
want to do

2119.2 --> 2123.2799999999997
no i'm not going to be able to settle fe

2121.92 --> 2125.599
topic

2123.28 --> 2126.5600000000004
yeah it's never going to be settled

2125.599 --> 2130.2400000000002
because you

2126.56 --> 2132.72
will never settle it doesn't matter what

2130.24 --> 2133.4399999999996
i do what i would subject myself to how

2132.72 --> 2135.7599999999998
many years

2133.44 --> 2137.04
you're always going to be here in chat

2135.76 --> 2139.44
whining

2137.04 --> 2141.359
oh look oh he's ignoring glow proof

2139.44 --> 2142.96
that's what you always do

2141.359 --> 2144.88
and what you always will do it's your

2142.96 --> 2147.119
curse is what you're gonna die with it's

2144.88 --> 2151.04
what god is gonna torture you with

2147.119 --> 2154.6400000000003
after death because you did not succeed

2151.04 --> 2157.52
the test yeah

2154.64 --> 2158.56
i don't give a [ __ ] it's your freaking

2157.52 --> 2161.119
problem

2158.56 --> 2161.119
not mine

2162.16 --> 2167.839
i don't give a [ __ ] you will not

2165.44 --> 2169.92
relinquish your globe belief i don't

2167.839 --> 2187.839
care

2169.92 --> 2187.839
yeah it's your problem not mine

2198.56 --> 2203.44
avoid the truth oh dude

2204.56 --> 2208.64
look who's talking even though there's

2206.72 --> 2211.9199999999996
nothing to look at with you because

2208.64 --> 2214.0
you're just a soft troll guy

2211.92 --> 2215.92
right there's nothing really to look at

2214.0 --> 2218.72
there

2215.92 --> 2219.359
look who's avoiding truth literally

2218.72 --> 2222.0
every

2219.359 --> 2223.68
[ __ ] step you avoid the truth every

2222.0 --> 2226.0
[ __ ] step there's no

2223.68 --> 2227.52
you don't even have a grip on natural

2226.0 --> 2230.4
mechanics

2227.52 --> 2232.0
everything is all broken all your

2230.4 --> 2234.8
knowledge is broken

2232.0 --> 2236.48
every tool you've ever had in your mind

2234.8 --> 2238.6400000000003
is broken

2236.48 --> 2241.119
because they made you break it because

2238.64 --> 2242.0
broken tools is the only way you can

2241.119 --> 2244.079
justify some

2242.0 --> 2245.04
kind of virtual globe of the world in

2244.079 --> 2248.4
your head

2245.04 --> 2251.079
yeah but now you're there with a whole

2248.4 --> 2253.839
bunch of broken tools in your head

2251.079 --> 2255.3590000000004
congratulations that's your [ __ ]

2253.839 --> 2256.16
problem you're the one that broke the

2255.359 --> 2259.2
tools

2256.16 --> 2262.0789999999997
for your belief yeah i don't give a [ __ ]

2259.2 --> 2263.1189999999997
that you can't understand anymore i

2262.079 --> 2266.5600000000004
don't give a [ __ ]

2263.119 --> 2270.2400000000002
you did that you did that to yourself

2266.56 --> 2273.599
in your head unable to grasp

2270.24 --> 2277.2799999999997
arguments yeah you did that it's not

2273.599 --> 2277.28
my problem okay

2278.88 --> 2282.2400000000002
no it doesn't work because you've

2280.88 --> 2284.88
ignored everything

2282.24 --> 2285.2799999999997
everything every argument ever made

2284.88 --> 2288.32
you're

2285.28 --> 2290.1600000000003
in this chat right for months i've been

2288.32 --> 2293.839
doing this for years

2290.16 --> 2298.0
and it's been the same my viewpoints

2293.839 --> 2300.4
my attitudes pretty much the same

2298.0 --> 2301.44
and i keep repeating it over and over

2300.4 --> 2305.2000000000003
again and you're not

2301.44 --> 2308.64
listening now some people have engaged

2305.2 --> 2309.9199999999996
that do listen and yeah they were able

2308.64 --> 2313.359
to grasp

2309.92 --> 2316.56
the point to the entire situation

2313.359 --> 2319.2
they were and it

2316.56 --> 2320.88
unchained them it gave them some freedom

2319.2 --> 2322.64
that they actually needed because they

2320.88 --> 2324.32
wanted to do something with that freedom

2322.64 --> 2328.0
and they felt changed right

2324.32 --> 2330.7200000000003
or you people you hide under your chains

2328.0 --> 2333.359
you're so chained up you're literally

2330.72 --> 2336.48
hiding under the pile of change

2333.359 --> 2338.96
chains that you are chained to to

2336.48 --> 2341.28
prevent others from seeing you

2338.96 --> 2355.839
you're hiding under your own chains you

2341.28 --> 2355.8390000000004
got that many chains on you

2357.359 --> 2360.88
oh quickly move on

2365.28 --> 2368.32
yeah well metal metal slug master you

2367.2 --> 2371.9199999999996
know when you

2368.32 --> 2374.0
enter a chat with so negative

2371.92 --> 2375.28
yeah that's typically how people get

2374.0 --> 2376.8
banned because

2375.28 --> 2379.52
if the first thing you're going to do

2376.8 --> 2382.2400000000002
when you step in where in somewhere

2379.52 --> 2382.56
is act like a dick yeah that's how you

2382.24 --> 2384.8799999999997
get

2382.56 --> 2384.88
banned

2386.56 --> 2391.7599999999998
think that's strange or you think that's

2388.88 --> 2391.76
actually normal

2392.56 --> 2397.44
you know when you go somewhere and

2395.44 --> 2400.88
you're new

2397.44 --> 2403.44
it's quite common that you actually act

2400.88 --> 2404.7200000000003
maybe a little bit nicer than you really

2403.44 --> 2407.76
are

2404.72 --> 2410.0789999999997
because there's new people you know

2407.76 --> 2410.8
you you have to represent because you're

2410.079 --> 2413.28
new

2410.8 --> 2414.6400000000003
and if you're gonna enter a place and

2413.28 --> 2425.8390000000004
act like a complete

2414.64 --> 2425.839
[ __ ] guess what's gonna happen

2426.24 --> 2439.839
hello guns have never owned rmp by the

2428.4 --> 2439.839
way good to see you

2441.44 --> 2453.839
you're new in this chat

2464.839 --> 2469.359
hello

2466.88 --> 2470.319
cool well foul longboat cannon look if

2469.359 --> 2474.56
youtube is

2470.319 --> 2477.7599999999998
actually more widely spread available

2474.56 --> 2480.96
through tvs yeah that's on one

2477.76 --> 2484.079
on one hand there's a lot of really

2480.96 --> 2486.56
stupid mind damaging

2484.079 --> 2487.6800000000003
[ __ ] just by the low level of

2486.56 --> 2491.92
intellectual

2487.68 --> 2494.0
conduct it's really damaging to

2491.92 --> 2495.599
watch that [ __ ] but yeah people get

2494.0 --> 2496.56
drawn into it and they do it to

2495.599 --> 2499.04
themselves

2496.56 --> 2500.319
so if that is more widely available on

2499.04 --> 2502.72
tv

2500.319 --> 2503.599
wouldn't be great but then again

2502.72 --> 2505.839
freaking out

2503.599 --> 2506.96
the tv just the programming that's

2505.839 --> 2509.44
already there

2506.96 --> 2510.88
is already kind of shitty so would it

2509.44 --> 2512.88
really matter

2510.88 --> 2515.52
and hey if it is available that means

2512.88 --> 2518.4
that i am technically available too

2515.52 --> 2518.4
so who knows

2521.599 --> 2537.839
who knows who's watching

2539.28 --> 2545.6800000000003
what dr gonza why would you say that or

2542.16 --> 2545.68
why are you straw manning me

2546.72 --> 2555.2
who said that machine learning is fake

2551.2 --> 2558.24
flawed sure of course it's flawed

2555.2 --> 2560.8799999999997
because it's made by man it's a system

2558.24 --> 2562.8799999999997
and then situations change and then

2560.88 --> 2564.4
suddenly it doesn't really work anymore

2562.88 --> 2567.28
because the way

2564.4 --> 2568.079
things happen out there the information

2567.28 --> 2572.7200000000003
and how it

2568.079 --> 2572.7200000000003
spreads it changes right

2572.8 --> 2578.079
so any ai program

2576.079 --> 2579.2000000000003
would always have to have kind of like

2578.079 --> 2593.8390000000004
caretakers

2579.2 --> 2593.839
who would help adapt it help it adapt

2597.599 --> 2601.52
oh all right well guns of nephron dude

2600.0 --> 2604.8
you just take care of

2601.52 --> 2604.8
whatever you need uh

2605.2 --> 2610.72
i'm a little tight myself financially

2608.4 --> 2614.4
but hey yeah

2610.72 --> 2614.3999999999996
i'll survive i hope

2616.56 --> 2621.359
and maybe some other people would also

2619.44 --> 2635.839
donate to my paypal that would

2621.359 --> 2635.839
certainly help you know

2641.04 --> 2645.68
ah oh cool that's good to hear rocket

2644.319 --> 2648.56
man yeah well ai

2645.68 --> 2652.0789999999997
had look i was interested in ai in the

2648.56 --> 2652.0789999999997
freaking late 90s okay

2652.96 --> 2660.079
and i kind of got into that a little

2657.76 --> 2661.76
like i've known people that have been ai

2660.079 --> 2665.28
programmers

2661.76 --> 2677.8390000000004
in early yeah like in in

2665.28 --> 2677.8390000000004
after the 2000s

2692.56 --> 2696.88
all right yeah jose bobington and all of

2694.8 --> 2698.8
you you don't have to worry about ai

2696.88 --> 2702.48
there is no point where the ai

2698.8 --> 2705.3590000000004
will certainly like outsmart everything

2702.48 --> 2706.88
it's always robots computers it's always

2705.359 --> 2711.5989999999997
secondary

2706.88 --> 2711.599
they will always be dependent on humans

2716.839 --> 2719.839
always

2731.839 --> 2738.16
it definitely won't yeah it will it will

2735.119 --> 2740.7200000000003
if it wants to keep developing

2738.16 --> 2740.72
yeah it will

2743.76 --> 2747.599
it's happening right now while you go

2745.599 --> 2751.76
lock yourself in your basement and be

2747.599 --> 2755.92
very very afraid then dr gonzo

2751.76 --> 2756.5600000000004
lock your basement until the terminators

2755.92 --> 2761.839
come

2756.56 --> 2761.839
yeah be very very afraid

2763.2 --> 2767.359
and yeah just leave me alone about it

2772.839 --> 2775.839
okay

2818.88 --> 2823.04
what year was spielberg's i don't know

2823.839 --> 2831.839
you could google that guns have never

2825.599 --> 2831.839
owned rmp

2867.599 --> 2874.1600000000003
right so

2870.8 --> 2874.8
let me try to explain something that i

2874.16 --> 2877.7599999999998
learned

2874.8 --> 2878.4
very early on i think it still is valid

2877.76 --> 2881.0400000000004
about

2878.4 --> 2883.44
the concept of programming and computer

2881.04 --> 2887.839
and algorithms and all that

2883.44 --> 2891.44
that is that

2887.839 --> 2894.0789999999997
humans tend to overlook what we all take

2891.44 --> 2899.2000000000003
for granted within our conscious right

2894.079 --> 2901.92
so if a computer is very effective

2899.2 --> 2903.2
then that means that what they produce

2901.92 --> 2905.76
has a good result

2903.2 --> 2908.16
for wider implications right well guess

2905.76 --> 2911.5200000000004
what computers

2908.16 --> 2915.2
tend to not really understand that

2911.52 --> 2917.119
they just that mechanisms and parameters

2915.2 --> 2919.839
handed to them they just try

2917.119 --> 2921.2000000000003
to solve the issues get the most

2919.839 --> 2923.839
efficient

2921.2 --> 2925.839
that's what computers can do through

2923.839 --> 2929.2
their systematic

2925.839 --> 2931.2799999999997
nature but at some point

2929.2 --> 2932.7999999999997
it's always going to be resolved

2931.28 --> 2934.88
whatever it is it's going to have

2932.8 --> 2936.96
fulfilled whatever it can do with the

2934.88 --> 2938.319
programming handed down to them

2936.96 --> 2940.96
and what's going to be the next

2938.319 --> 2943.359
programming so either without humans

2940.96 --> 2944.88
computers will end up in a stuck cycle

2943.359 --> 2947.04
that's never going to change or they're

2944.88 --> 2951.839
just going to be stuck

2947.04 --> 2955.2
because without an overseer a human mind

2951.839 --> 2957.359
to give it an actual purpose it's going

2955.2 --> 2961.04
to run out of purpose

2957.359 --> 2964.88
right computers can never survive

2961.04 --> 2971.839
or be like humans

2964.88 --> 2971.839
even close to it without humans

2972.0 --> 2978.96
yeah i concluded there this fear yeah

2975.359 --> 2979.52
right or the ai has already figured out

2978.96 --> 2981.76
like yeah

2979.52 --> 2983.359
humans are so [ __ ] stupid if we say

2981.76 --> 2985.28
the earth is a globe even though every

2983.359 --> 2988.5589999999997
technical evidence

2985.28 --> 2991.599
disproves that then they will

2988.559 --> 2996.2400000000002
fall on their knees and die for us

2991.599 --> 2996.2400000000002
huh this is

2996.839 --> 2999.839
sorry

3024.839 --> 3027.839
eh

3041.76 --> 3047.92
wow well dr gonzo if if the ai has been

3045.68 --> 3051.2
able to predict

3047.92 --> 3054.7200000000003
the orbits

3051.2 --> 3057.7599999999998
right without actually having the

3054.72 --> 3058.64
the data about gravity and the mechanics

3057.76 --> 3061.8390000000004
behind it

3058.64 --> 3064.7999999999997
could it be that it's deduced

3061.839 --> 3066.5589999999997
a cyclical nature with prediction

3064.8 --> 3069.119
predicting capability

3066.559 --> 3072.48
because he didn't need any of that

3069.119 --> 3075.599
because of the inherent cyclical nature

3072.48 --> 3077.76
of the phenomena presented of the

3075.599 --> 3081.28
celestial globe of the heavens

3077.76 --> 3084.0
yeah so even the computer is smart

3081.28 --> 3087.3590000000004
enough to realize it's [ __ ]

3084.0 --> 3089.839
it's just giving you back the data as is

3087.359 --> 3091.2799999999997
and leaving you to your illusions about

3089.839 --> 3094.319
gravity

3091.28 --> 3096.0
and ball belief just giving analyzing

3094.319 --> 3098.64
the data realizing yeah there is a very

3096.0 --> 3100.4
predictable systematic cyclic cyclical

3098.64 --> 3103.68
nature to this pattern

3100.4 --> 3107.359
this is how you do it yeah

3103.68 --> 3111.839
it it doesn't

3107.359 --> 3116.16
need to know gravity in order to predict

3111.839 --> 3119.88
things with the celestial bodies huh

3116.16 --> 3123.2
so it it globe not required

3119.88 --> 3124.6400000000003
heliocentrism not required just analyzes

3123.2 --> 3128.0789999999997
the

3124.64 --> 3132.48
data patterns isn't that just funny

3128.079 --> 3135.8390000000004
yeah or or did you think that

3132.48 --> 3139.599
maybe the ai the literal digital

3135.839 --> 3142.48
program made to follow certain

3139.599 --> 3144.079
maybe it secretly has a consciousness

3142.48 --> 3147.119
and in that consciousness

3144.079 --> 3150.1600000000003
it secretly is already figured out that

3147.119 --> 3152.7200000000003
it's a heliocentric paul universe

3150.16 --> 3153.5989999999997
and it's keeping it a secret the ai

3152.72 --> 3156.0789999999997
program

3153.599 --> 3157.52
that analyzed the data it's keeping a

3156.079 --> 3160.8
secret from you

3157.52 --> 3161.92
it's keeping a secret because it knows

3160.8 --> 3164.319
about gravity

3161.92 --> 3166.88
it already knew right because we gave it

3164.319 --> 3168.8
the data without even saying

3166.88 --> 3170.6400000000003
that gravity is a thing and it was able

3168.8 --> 3174.319
to predict

3170.64 --> 3180.0
patterns in the heavens oh

3174.319 --> 3181.52
oh my god the ai knows it's a globe

3180.0 --> 3183.119
yeah look at them squirt look at them

3181.52 --> 3186.4
squirt

3183.119 --> 3190.4
squirt for me zealots come on do it

3186.4 --> 3194.96
go go go it's secretly new

3190.4 --> 3197.359
the digital data program

3194.96 --> 3198.0
that's basically doing things step by

3197.359 --> 3201.5989999999997
step it

3198.0 --> 3202.96
secretly had a knowledge outside of the

3201.599 --> 3205.6800000000003
program

3202.96 --> 3206.88
about gravity because it was able to

3205.68 --> 3210.0789999999997
predict

3206.88 --> 3211.92
eclipses and little things

3210.079 --> 3213.599
in the celestial bodies and he didn't

3211.92 --> 3216.64
even know about gravity

3213.599 --> 3218.4
well maybe yeah i'm not i'm not even

3216.64 --> 3222.16
gonna spoil it anymore i'm just

3218.4 --> 3225.44
gonna leave it just like that for you

3222.16 --> 3228.24
just go and assimilate that

3225.44 --> 3229.68
yeah go go worry about the ai having

3228.24 --> 3233.04
secret memories about

3229.68 --> 3236.48
things it hasn't been told about yeah

3233.04 --> 3251.839
because it has to be a globe has to be

3236.48 --> 3251.839
right go ahead

3258.72 --> 3265.839
it's just so funny

3270.16 --> 3278.24
yeah this show is fantastic because

3273.2 --> 3279.839
it just reveals live on the spot how

3278.24 --> 3282.5589999999997
deep the delusions sink

3279.839 --> 3284.64
you will literally discontort reality

3282.559 --> 3287.76
have fantastical

3284.64 --> 3291.2
mystical things for placed

3287.76 --> 3293.6800000000003
by your mind in reality in your view

3291.2 --> 3294.3999999999996
because you don't understand that the

3293.68 --> 3297.2799999999997
entire

3294.4 --> 3298.48
entire heliocentric conception

3297.28 --> 3301.52
physicality

3298.48 --> 3302.64
of the the celestial lights and the

3301.52 --> 3306.079
gravity suppose

3302.64 --> 3309.839
that that is all secondary it's a

3306.079 --> 3313.04
painting made on a frame and the frame

3309.839 --> 3316.16
is the data the frame what

3313.04 --> 3318.24
is the angular position in relation to

3316.16 --> 3320.3999999999996
that specific position on the earth

3318.24 --> 3321.5989999999997
cross-reference every other angular

3320.4 --> 3324.88
position

3321.599 --> 3326.799
of celestial lights across the heavens

3324.88 --> 3328.079
figure out a cyclical pattern in a

3326.799 --> 3331.599
cyclical nature then

3328.079 --> 3335.8390000000004
use the cyclical nature

3331.599 --> 3339.119
to be able to predict crossing points

3335.839 --> 3342.4
none of it has to be physical it's

3339.119 --> 3345.6800000000003
just data cross referencing

3342.4 --> 3346.48
yeah but you actually believe that

3345.68 --> 3349.5989999999997
secretly

3346.48 --> 3351.76
knew it was a globe you said to me

3349.599 --> 3353.2000000000003
but it didn't even have to gravity data

3351.76 --> 3357.3590000000004
and it was able to predict

3353.2 --> 3357.359
just listen to yourself man

3360.839 --> 3363.839
it's

3368.24 --> 3377.839
it's just amazing

3388.839 --> 3395.92
so

3391.2 --> 3395.9199999999996
it's not too late to join the university

3397.76 --> 3402.4
you mean my university yes it's not too

3400.559 --> 3404.2400000000002
late to join my university

3402.4 --> 3406.079
but you can stay on the sidelines and

3404.24 --> 3408.5589999999997
just squirt

3406.079 --> 3409.44
and have your ball believe all you want

3408.559 --> 3411.8390000000004
but yes you

3409.44 --> 3414.64
you can technically join my university

3411.839 --> 3417.599
by being present in chat

3414.64 --> 3417.5989999999997
paying attention

3417.68 --> 3422.3999999999996
and resolving issues as they are

3420.72 --> 3425.4399999999996
presented

3422.4 --> 3428.799
and eventually you'll you'll become part

3425.44 --> 3431.359
of my university my online university

3428.799 --> 3431.359
right here

3431.599 --> 3436.799
because my university is where i'm at

3438.64 --> 3446.0789999999997
and if you learn my mechanics

3441.68 --> 3448.8799999999997
learn my lore then you become part of my

3446.079 --> 3448.88
university

3452.4 --> 3455.599
if you don't understand any of it and

3454.24 --> 3458.4799999999996
you're just gonna

3455.599 --> 3460.0
try to ridicule it yeah then there's

3458.48 --> 3461.359
nothing really left

3460.0 --> 3463.92
for you then you're not gonna get

3461.359 --> 3475.839
anything out of it except

3463.92 --> 3475.839
a lot of bad behavior

3476.72 --> 3481.5989999999997
ah metal slug master is not entirely

3478.799 --> 3483.92
true donate to my paypal

3481.599 --> 3483.92
you know

3484.88 --> 3489.04
there may not be like an entry fee but

3487.44 --> 3490.64
if you're going to be part of it

3489.04 --> 3492.64
and you don't want it to literally

3490.64 --> 3496.5589999999997
collapse in on you around you you're

3492.64 --> 3496.5589999999997
going to have to dominate at some point

3496.96 --> 3501.44
and if you're just wanting to parasite

3499.839 --> 3503.04
and make it worse then you will get

3501.44 --> 3517.839
kicked out eventually that's how this

3503.04 --> 3517.839
university works

3531.2 --> 3538.72
i'm gonna provide food on the table

3534.72 --> 3542.839
well it might

3538.72 --> 3544.0
you know my university what it actually

3542.839 --> 3547.92
does

3544.0 --> 3550.96
is help people find a way through

3547.92 --> 3554.2400000000002
when they're stuck right that's

3550.96 --> 3554.96
what i typically do is help people find

3554.24 --> 3559.839
a way through

3554.96 --> 3559.839
if they're open enough to accept it

3562.559 --> 3573.8390000000004
so wherever you're at you know

3565.599 --> 3573.839
wherever you're at

3576.079 --> 3579.92
but basically whatever profession you're

3578.0 --> 3580.48
going to do there is something you can

3579.92 --> 3583.04
learn

3580.48 --> 3584.16
in every profession and there are things

3583.04 --> 3586.5589999999997
you can improve

3584.16 --> 3590.5589999999997
in every profession and there's skills

3586.559 --> 3601.8390000000004
you can build in every profession

3590.559 --> 3601.8390000000004
in some way

3622.079 --> 3629.8390000000004
amateur footage of mars

3639.92 --> 3643.839
yes yes metal slug master

3644.72 --> 3649.04
or isn't that kind of like how

3646.16 --> 3651.839
university works in works in general

3649.04 --> 3655.359
it's not like you'd have to pay a fee

3651.839 --> 3657.44
immediately as you cross the front door

3655.359 --> 3660.24
there's like open days where you can

3657.44 --> 3662.16
check it out is this something i like

3660.24 --> 3663.5989999999997
but then if you want to actually be part

3662.16 --> 3667.1189999999997
of it yeah then you have to pay

3663.599 --> 3669.52
big time right well with me

3667.119 --> 3670.319
it's more a blend like you can

3669.52 --> 3672.96
immediately

3670.319 --> 3672.96
start learning

3673.44 --> 3677.839
and then walk away and then at least

3676.16 --> 3679.359
spread the knowledge and then maybe

3677.839 --> 3680.5589999999997
other people will be interested and

3679.359 --> 3683.68
drawn in by that

3680.559 --> 3685.44
so it's like a form of advertisement

3683.68 --> 3687.68
just by then spreading the knowledge and

3685.44 --> 3691.52
the insights and yeah

3687.68 --> 3699.839
or you could stay and really

3691.52 --> 3699.839
try to help me build it even better

3700.72 --> 3713.839
and it's up to you

3725.52 --> 3732.72
thank you very much about in

3728.88 --> 3735.76
500 for the 4.99 super chat donation

3732.72 --> 3738.0789999999997
are our win really are when

3735.76 --> 3739.039
it's not our wins our win university but

3738.079 --> 3742.4
that's fine

3739.039 --> 3746.3190000000004
we in university better than any college

3742.4 --> 3750.64
here in los angeles oops

3746.319 --> 3755.839
youtube crashed did you see that

3750.64 --> 3755.839
that's weird

3756.72 --> 3759.359
back to now

3760.96 --> 3764.559
yeah thank you for the super chat

3762.799 --> 3766.96
donation i do appreciate it

3764.559 --> 3769.599
i have noticed by the way that that's

3766.96 --> 3771.44
fine about it 500 i know

3769.599 --> 3773.76
i appreciate the donation it's been a

3771.44 --> 3775.68
while i don't get that much i don't know

3773.76 --> 3778.2400000000002
what it is maybe it's really like

3775.68 --> 3779.9199999999996
the average wealth is just dramatically

3778.24 --> 3780.9599999999996
decreased and nobody can afford it

3779.92 --> 3783.28
anymore

3780.96 --> 3784.64
but i've like cross-referenced the

3783.28 --> 3788.0
income

3784.64 --> 3789.2799999999997
even through youtube in general and it's

3788.0 --> 3794.0
been very low

3789.28 --> 3797.76
like below average in the last

3794.0 --> 3801.52
two months three months actually

3797.76 --> 3810.0
so i'm not directly complaining i'm just

3801.52 --> 3812.16
saying i take a notice of this

3810.0 --> 3815.44
that's purely like through super chats

3812.16 --> 3815.44
and advertisement money

3821.359 --> 3825.68
and it's weird by the way because i

3824.319 --> 3828.24
don't understand how it

3825.68 --> 3830.319
it should own like just through the ads

3828.24 --> 3834.799
alone it should only be going up

3830.319 --> 3834.799
on average but it's been going down

3836.72 --> 3840.64
even though the amount of shows that

3838.48 --> 3842.319
have ads on them which is technically

3840.64 --> 3853.839
every single one of them

3842.319 --> 3853.839
is going up so i don't really understand

3864.839 --> 3867.839
oh

3878.88 --> 3883.599
below average for everyone not invested

3880.88 --> 3883.599
in crypto

3883.76 --> 3895.8390000000004
already had about five what

3910.4 --> 3917.039
yes wow you're so slow

3913.839 --> 3923.839
do you have me on delay or something

3917.039 --> 3923.8390000000004
in france

3934.839 --> 3937.839
um

3961.599 --> 3971.119
what i threatened you with a ban

3965.599 --> 3971.119
really that's what you heard in all that

3973.839 --> 3979.839
really metal slug master is that really

3977.2 --> 3979.839
what you heard

3983.92 --> 3988.079
you do realize there's just complete

3986.0 --> 3989.2
baller squirters in here that have been

3988.079 --> 3991.6800000000003
here for months and

3989.2 --> 3994.5589999999997
just let them like i used to ban them

3991.68 --> 3994.5589999999997
just for that

3994.64 --> 3997.359
they don't pay

3999.2 --> 4004.839
so how did you hear that in there that

4001.52 --> 4007.839
you're gonna get banned if you don't

4004.839 --> 4007.839
donate

4010.799 --> 4015.92
yeah i just laid out just the setup of

4014.559 --> 4018.88
the situation

4015.92 --> 4020.16
how is that or or maybe i got to your

4018.88 --> 4023.039
feelings and you just

4020.16 --> 4024.3999999999996
realized that i was right and that you

4023.039 --> 4026.4
probably should donate

4024.4 --> 4027.52
right well that's not blackmailing you

4026.4 --> 4030.2400000000002
to donate that's

4027.52 --> 4032.24
just called getting to you sorry if you

4030.24 --> 4034.16
can't handle it

4032.24 --> 4035.52
right but i'm not gonna ban you if you

4034.16 --> 4037.2799999999997
don't donate

4035.52 --> 4038.64
i'm gonna ban you if you act like an

4037.28 --> 4042.7200000000003
[ __ ]

4038.64 --> 4049.839
but i'm not gonna pre-assume that that's

4042.72 --> 4049.839
gonna happen

4074.16 --> 4077.839
yeah i came saying

4078.16 --> 4081.2799999999997
[Music]

4094.079 --> 4100.719
well metal slug master you see

4097.44 --> 4103.2789999999995
i'm not going to kick you for

4100.719 --> 4104.0
coming by regularly and not donating i

4103.279 --> 4106.2390000000005
am going to

4104.0 --> 4107.44
kick you eventually though for

4106.239 --> 4110.879999999999
complaining

4107.44 --> 4113.2789999999995
about how you think you would have to

4110.88 --> 4116.0
and you don't stop talking about it

4113.279 --> 4118.159000000001
start to become really nagging

4116.0 --> 4119.199
that would be a reason to ban you for so

4118.159 --> 4121.44
if you don't stop

4119.199 --> 4122.5599999999995
whining about this i will ban you for

4121.44 --> 4124.639999999999
that

4122.56 --> 4126.159000000001
right not for not donating but for

4124.64 --> 4133.839
whining about it

4126.159 --> 4133.839
you get it

4144.839 --> 4148.41
so

4146.319 --> 4151.529
mars is your cousin okay

4148.41 --> 4151.5289999999995
[Music]

4153.199 --> 4162.239
yeah i know guns have never owned rmp

4160.0 --> 4164.0
i really feel like a gardener sometimes

4162.239 --> 4175.04
and just there's some ballers

4164.0 --> 4178.48
just you gotta give them a try

4175.04 --> 4181.359
you know not to be too rough but

4178.48 --> 4182.879999999999
like it's like with weeds just like

4181.359 --> 4185.92
regular weeds out there

4182.88 --> 4188.96
some weeds are pretty cool and

4185.92 --> 4189.839
like have even like things yeah some

4188.96 --> 4191.92
weeds can be

4189.839 --> 4193.6
even used as food and some have really

4191.92 --> 4196.4
beautiful flowers right it's not like

4193.6 --> 4198.8
all weeds always suck

4196.4 --> 4200.0
so yeah i have a bit of a garden here

4198.8 --> 4202.8
like that

4200.0 --> 4204.4
and some weeds i keep and even though

4202.8 --> 4206.0
they're weeds yeah they still might

4204.4 --> 4209.92
serve a purpose and i just get

4206.0 --> 4212.64
all the thistle and all the annoying

4209.92 --> 4213.52
poisonous plant poison ivy those i root

4212.64 --> 4215.76
out

4213.52 --> 4217.280000000001
but i just leave the regular ones i've

4215.76 --> 4219.679
also by the way learned that

4217.28 --> 4221.5199999999995
a lot of those types of plants actually

4219.679 --> 4223.679
are good for the soil and all that

4221.52 --> 4225.6
so right it's funny how that works out

4223.679 --> 4231.1990000000005
the metaphor

4225.6 --> 4233.4400000000005
so yes i try to keep the

4231.199 --> 4235.678999999999
the lesser toxic ballers or the

4233.44 --> 4238.5599999999995
non-toxic there might be some non-toxic

4235.679 --> 4238.56
out there completely

4250.0 --> 4259.84
hey julio pebbin good to see you

4263.679 --> 4266.8
right exactly metal slug masters you get

4265.92 --> 4273.679
it

4266.8 --> 4276.0
that's cool

4273.679 --> 4278.0
and also it's it's kind of a funny

4276.0 --> 4278.4
rebuttal you know if somebody's good oh

4278.0 --> 4280.48
they're

4278.4 --> 4282.639999999999
weeds if somebody's like really trying

4280.48 --> 4284.799999999999
to how do you call that

4282.64 --> 4286.08
put down some group and call them weeds

4284.8 --> 4289.04
you know being very

4286.08 --> 4289.6
bigoted in some way and it's like what

4289.04 --> 4292.4
but

4289.6 --> 4294.08
not all weeds are bad there's some

4292.4 --> 4295.839999999999
actually edible weeds they're really

4294.08 --> 4296.4
beautiful some weeds are good for the

4295.84 --> 4298.64
soil

4296.4 --> 4299.5199999999995
like you could be really pedantic about

4298.64 --> 4302.96
that

4299.52 --> 4302.96
and just yeah

4303.6 --> 4316.320000000001
yes i am dutch game scion

4314.0 --> 4316.32
hmm

4318.32 --> 4329.84
all right foul on buchanan see you later

4346.159 --> 4357.839999999999
ah that's a good one roof and saint

4347.84 --> 4357.84
hubbins i really like that

4362.32 --> 4365.679
right but sometimes you know

4367.04 --> 4372.4
the problem is that people that do feel

4369.679 --> 4374.96
like that that are very stressed

4372.4 --> 4375.839999999999
and that want that stress to be on well

4374.96 --> 4377.6
me

4375.84 --> 4381.04
and people that believe the opposite of

4377.6 --> 4383.1990000000005
what they believe they do come in

4381.04 --> 4384.159
and that's also the reason why sometimes

4383.199 --> 4387.678999999999
just

4384.159 --> 4390.4
get really harsh all of a sudden

4387.679 --> 4391.52
right compared to for example like how i

4390.4 --> 4394.4
am now

4391.52 --> 4394.400000000001
very calm and

4394.719 --> 4398.64
it's really those people that do that

4397.679 --> 4401.88
but

4398.64 --> 4405.52
in face-to-face situations i've had

4401.88 --> 4407.76
similarities to it although yeah through

4405.52 --> 4409.84
the internet it does kind of condense

4407.76 --> 4412.56
even more it becomes even

4409.84 --> 4414.400000000001
more pronounced the effects of that

4412.56 --> 4416.080000000001
social interaction situation

4414.4 --> 4418.5599999999995
and in the real world too if somebody

4416.08 --> 4420.48
just comes into your space

4418.56 --> 4421.6
or if you talk with and just get really

4420.48 --> 4425.44
in your face

4421.6 --> 4427.92
you gotta respond because if you don't

4425.44 --> 4430.159
then there's like this weird bully

4427.92 --> 4432.4800000000005
polarized social situation that will

4430.159 --> 4436.0
come out of it

4432.48 --> 4440.0
right and for stemming from that habit

4436.0 --> 4442.0
just god has i gotta reciprocate and

4440.0 --> 4444.96
that's why i get really rough sometimes

4442.0 --> 4444.96
and sometimes like

4445.76 --> 4450.96
yeah pretty sharp and nasty in a way

4452.4 --> 4455.599999999999
kind of merciless in a psychological

4454.64 --> 4460.8
level i

4455.6 --> 4460.8
have to i don't like it but if you don't

4460.88 --> 4469.28
basically if you don't show your weapon

4465.199 --> 4472.08
then the situation will transform into

4469.28 --> 4472.08
something bad

4472.8 --> 4479.52
right i tried completely ignoring

4476.88 --> 4480.64
negative behavior by just banning it by

4479.52 --> 4483.52
just banning that

4480.64 --> 4485.12
and the people that do that like way in

4483.52 --> 4488.719
the earlier years of this

4485.12 --> 4491.12
youtube channel i did that

4488.719 --> 4492.4
it didn't work they just became more

4491.12 --> 4494.719
obsessed with me

4492.4 --> 4495.679
as i would try to effectively completely

4494.719 --> 4498.4
keep it out

4495.679 --> 4501.28
so it's just you have to show your fangs

4498.4 --> 4504.5599999999995
sometimes you have to show

4501.28 --> 4506.639999999999
that you can defend yourself that they

4504.56 --> 4508.4800000000005
really can get to you and that works

4506.64 --> 4511.52
better

4508.48 --> 4514.4
it's weird it just works better it's

4511.52 --> 4514.400000000001
worked better for me

4517.12 --> 4525.84
exterminate them dr gonzo

4531.36 --> 4542.0
ah guns have never run rp yes totally

4538.159 --> 4546.0
in a way i am a disgruntled nasa fan

4542.0 --> 4549.04
myself and i still have a

4546.0 --> 4552.48
really almost bleeding heart

4549.04 --> 4554.239
liberal type of very remote dream that's

4552.48 --> 4556.159
probably never gonna happen

4554.239 --> 4558.0
that it would be turned into something

4556.159 --> 4562.48
that's alright and not so

4558.0 --> 4566.48
dark that we could have like a

4562.48 --> 4567.44
world stage heliocentric dream that

4566.48 --> 4570.5599999999995
could be

4567.44 --> 4575.44
put on by them in a non-nefarious way

4570.56 --> 4575.4400000000005
as a just a yeah as a big dream

4576.32 --> 4581.44
that you would be allowed to be snapped

4578.4 --> 4583.92
out of without then getting

4581.44 --> 4586.08
major detriments in society because of

4583.92 --> 4586.08
it

4588.56 --> 4592.080000000001
so when i first figured out like hey

4590.4 --> 4593.599999999999
nasa it's not good with there's

4592.08 --> 4594.64
something wrong here they're just not

4593.6 --> 4597.6
doing it right

4594.64 --> 4599.76
i was my first response was okay so how

4597.6 --> 4602.2390000000005
are we going to replace them by somebody

4599.76 --> 4604.96
that's actually going to do the job

4602.239 --> 4606.839999999999
that was my first response to that way

4604.96 --> 4609.84
before

4606.84 --> 4609.84
2015

4620.08 --> 4624.96
and i'm still not just letting that go

4622.4 --> 4624.96
entirely

4628.719 --> 4637.84
and who knows where it's gonna lead

4651.6 --> 4655.84
anyone seen another koala lately uh

4656.64 --> 4665.84
not sure a hana koala it's not

4659.92 --> 4665.84
like in the chat on a daily basis

4667.52 --> 4679.84
i think i saw her at least like within a

4670.48 --> 4679.839999999999
week ago

4691.76 --> 4696.56
okay voynich you have a rectangular loop

4698.239 --> 4707.839999999999
i've seen those it's weird i don't even

4700.08 --> 4707.84
know why they're like that

4709.199 --> 4712.239
yeah over mobile yeah obermocco's been

4711.04 --> 4721.84
gone for a while

4712.239 --> 4721.839999999999
i don't know what's going on with that

4730.48 --> 4735.839999999999
for reading hmm okay

4743.679 --> 4749.84
yeah i agree tom parker he was

4770.719 --> 4775.36
it's really petty fantasizing it's like

4773.52 --> 4778.4800000000005
fan fiction

4775.36 --> 4779.44
why do these ballers always do why do

4778.48 --> 4781.678999999999
you do that

4779.44 --> 4782.879999999999
fan fiction on somebody it's like oh

4781.679 --> 4786.159
somebody's leaving that

4782.88 --> 4788.159000000001
means i'm going to fantasize about how

4786.159 --> 4789.36
they stepped away from flat earth and

4788.159 --> 4791.839999999999
realized it was a ball

4789.36 --> 4794.0
after all and then basically went on

4791.84 --> 4798.719
their knees and

4794.0 --> 4798.719
prayed to nasa i'm sorry i doubted you

4800.56 --> 4808.56
it's i don't know why you do that

4804.239 --> 4808.5599999999995
why you share that so petty

4815.04 --> 4820.32
can you make the chat font size a little

4818.0 --> 4820.32
bigger

4823.199 --> 4830.4
i'm sorry flat ai it look the chat size

4827.12 --> 4833.5199999999995
of like in the screen

4830.4 --> 4836.48
it's not really meant for you to

4833.52 --> 4839.120000000001
read it during the live show that's what

4836.48 --> 4842.159
the youtube chat is for

4839.12 --> 4845.199
what the chat on the side is for is to

4842.159 --> 4847.679
have it all recorded because

4845.199 --> 4848.5599999999995
technically you can watch my shows at

4847.679 --> 4851.52
say

4848.56 --> 4852.96
really high resolution it is an option

4851.52 --> 4853.76
and if you look at it at write

4852.96 --> 4858.4
resolution

4853.76 --> 4861.679
then you can see then you can read it

4858.4 --> 4864.5599999999995
so it's more like a

4861.679 --> 4865.4400000000005
an extra recording of the text because

4864.56 --> 4868.88
youtube

4865.44 --> 4872.32
chats can be screwed with afterward

4868.88 --> 4874.639
right somebody times it out

4872.32 --> 4876.719
somebody gets timed out in the chat for

4874.639 --> 4878.159000000001
whatever reason sometimes

4876.719 --> 4880.0
like everything they said during the

4878.159 --> 4882.08
whole thing gets removed and you can't

4880.0 --> 4885.36
see that back in the playback

4882.08 --> 4888.0
that's what the sidechat is for

4885.36 --> 4889.599999999999
to have it all on record like it can be

4888.0 --> 4892.719
removed it can't be edited

4889.6 --> 4893.4400000000005
it's literally on screen as part of the

4892.719 --> 4897.6
visual

4893.44 --> 4903.839999999999
cannot be edited it is exactly as is

4897.6 --> 4903.84
that's what the chat's for

4908.48 --> 4912.08
all right flat ai now it's perfectly

4910.159 --> 4915.12
okay

4912.08 --> 4916.639
i get it like i'm looking at the chat

4915.12 --> 4919.599999999999
right now and yeah i

4916.639 --> 4931.84
agree it is a little tough to read it

4919.6 --> 4931.84
you really have to get up close

4954.96 --> 4973.84
whoa guns would never own an rp that's

4957.44 --> 4973.839999999999
really heavy man

4982.08 --> 4988.88
uh what else can it do besides

4986.08 --> 4990.639
the flat earth besides science

4988.88 --> 4991.28
sharpening scientific understanding and

4990.639 --> 4995.36
is pro

4991.28 --> 4995.36
exposing misleading theories well

4995.52 --> 5000.159000000001
just by the engagement of that process

4997.44 --> 5003.36
alone it helps to

5000.159 --> 5007.04
for it helps people to distinguish

5003.36 --> 5007.92
lies from truth also the actions that

5007.04 --> 5011.199
accompany

5007.92 --> 5014.4
both just to understand lying and

5011.199 --> 5016.48
telling the truth better as an action

5014.4 --> 5018.719
not to recognize it in others so you

5016.48 --> 5020.638999999999
really get to understand what's going on

5018.719 --> 5023.44
how it's really working

5020.639 --> 5024.2390000000005
so it's not just the specific

5023.44 --> 5026.08
understanding

5024.239 --> 5027.759999999999
in the field in which we are being

5026.08 --> 5031.679
deceived

5027.76 --> 5031.679
it's also understanding why

5032.8 --> 5036.400000000001
how did it get to this why do people do

5036.08 --> 5039.36
this

5036.4 --> 5041.5199999999995
there's so much more to figure out in

5039.36 --> 5044.639
detail

5041.52 --> 5045.92
once the truth sinks in as to like what

5044.639 --> 5049.36
is the setup

5045.92 --> 5052.719
how did it get to this and i've been

5049.36 --> 5052.719
talking about that to no end

5053.84 --> 5058.159000000001
there's so much psychology to be figured

5068.84 --> 5071.84
out

5088.88 --> 5092.8
hmm wow that is pretty heavy dude guns

5091.679 --> 5099.84
have never owned that

5092.8 --> 5099.84
somebody in your family

5124.719 --> 5129.12
right but yet nathan has talked about

5126.96 --> 5131.92
this too you know nathan oakley

5129.12 --> 5133.28
but how nasa really is the leading edge

5131.92 --> 5136.56
of cinematography

5133.28 --> 5139.679
and other

5136.56 --> 5141.6
media the media groups and the producers

5139.679 --> 5145.76
and the movie makers basically

5141.6 --> 5147.6
follow them so nasa does get involved

5145.76 --> 5149.679
just in cinematography because

5147.6 --> 5151.92
they are the ones that are the keepers

5149.679 --> 5154.159
of the dream the keepers of the dream

5151.92 --> 5155.28
the representation of what it's supposed

5154.159 --> 5160.239
to be like

5155.28 --> 5163.04
when you look at it through the cgi

5160.239 --> 5163.678999999999
right so they determine like when you

5163.04 --> 5167.28
look at

5163.679 --> 5169.6
the supposed ball earth in an image

5167.28 --> 5171.28
what will that typically be like what

5169.6 --> 5174.4800000000005
would that have to be like

5171.28 --> 5175.599999999999
right and whatever that they represented

5174.48 --> 5179.678999999999
as

5175.6 --> 5182.320000000001
if you for example i've even

5179.679 --> 5184.56
i'm getting a little scattered and even

5182.32 --> 5187.84
way back years back i said like

5184.56 --> 5190.0
dude even if the earth was a ball who's

5187.84 --> 5192.4800000000005
to say it'll actually look like those

5190.0 --> 5192.48
pictures

5193.6 --> 5197.120000000001
wouldn't it be complete wouldn't it just

5196.639 --> 5200.0
be

5197.12 --> 5201.599999999999
the surface would just be all blurred up

5200.0 --> 5203.12
because of the thickness of the area

5201.6 --> 5206.0
looking through all of it

5203.12 --> 5207.92
so who's to say you'd see any clear cut

5206.0 --> 5210.719
out landscape and all that

5207.92 --> 5212.719
there's too much air to look through

5210.719 --> 5214.639
like i've had that realization so

5212.719 --> 5216.8
basically nasa through

5214.639 --> 5219.04
the cinematography have just decided

5216.8 --> 5221.52
when you look at the ball earth

5219.04 --> 5223.12
you look at it almost as if it did not

5221.52 --> 5226.639
have any air

5223.12 --> 5239.84
they'll show you clouds they'll not

5226.639 --> 5239.84
show the actual effects of the air

5893.92 --> 5901.52
ha that was good yeah sorry for the

5897.84 --> 5901.52
prolonged wait that was actually

5902.159 --> 5906.239
basically getting in a point appointment

5904.96 --> 5908.32
for uh

5906.239 --> 5909.36
for the lawyer and it sounded really

5908.32 --> 5911.36
good

5909.36 --> 5925.839999999999
now however i have to have a toilet

5911.36 --> 5925.839999999999
break i'll see you back in two minutes

6004.96 --> 6012.56
right huh

6008.159 --> 6012.5599999999995
but that phone call was very good

6016.719 --> 6023.84
i got an appointment for next wednesday

6024.0 --> 6028.159
and it should work out just fine

6032.56 --> 6037.76
so what did i miss guys i don't know how

6035.04 --> 6039.119
long was i on the phone

6037.76 --> 6041.679
it shouldn't be like more than five

6039.119 --> 6041.679
minutes right

6044.239 --> 6052.0
even if in secret arwen is loaded

6048.56 --> 6057.52
yeah i know i'm loaded

6052.0 --> 6057.52
but financially not so much

6058.4 --> 6065.839999999999
not yet anyway

6070.32 --> 6079.84
but i do i do agree that i have

6074.8 --> 6079.84
managed to uphold a certain

6079.92 --> 6083.4400000000005
it's gonna sound weird a certain level

6082.0 --> 6087.6
of classiness

6083.44 --> 6090.96
despite my poverty i've managed to not

6087.6 --> 6092.8
let myself really turn to trash by the

6090.96 --> 6096.2390000000005
poverty

6092.8 --> 6098.52
that's that's correct so i would

6096.239 --> 6099.919999999999
i would understand how you could in a

6098.52 --> 6101.84
conspiratorial way

6099.92 --> 6103.36
think that i might be really loaded

6101.84 --> 6106.719
pretending to be poor

6103.36 --> 6108.5599999999995
i wouldn't understand that and in

6106.719 --> 6111.04
reality it's actually sort of the other

6108.56 --> 6111.04
way around

6112.239 --> 6117.919999999999
i'm trying to not look poor even though

6115.199 --> 6117.919999999999
i kind of am

6120.8 --> 6126.159000000001
and besides i'm not i might be poor

6123.76 --> 6130.08
financially a bit

6126.159 --> 6130.08
i don't know like compared to

6130.88 --> 6134.0
people in in third world countries is

6133.36 --> 6136.88
ridiculous

6134.0 --> 6138.48
i'm really freaking rich compared to

6136.88 --> 6141.84
people in third world countries

6138.48 --> 6144.4
okay but compared to the rest of the

6141.84 --> 6144.400000000001
netherlands

6153.52 --> 6156.639
what the [ __ ] dude

6159.119 --> 6163.839999999999
like how old is he even

6164.08 --> 6177.84
how old is elon musk

6167.199 --> 6177.839999999999
it's kind of ridiculous

6180.8 --> 6187.04
dude if i was his kid then he would have

6184.32 --> 6191.84
conceived me when he was nine

6187.04 --> 6191.84
this is absolutely absurd

6194.32 --> 6197.679
but you probably knew that

6202.4 --> 6205.44
i'm doing a bad job of trying to not

6205.119 --> 6209.199
look

6205.44 --> 6213.5199999999995
poor ah

6209.199 --> 6213.5199999999995
but not that bad a job red pill trill

6214.08 --> 6217.679
not that bad because indie francis

6216.48 --> 6233.839999999999
thought that i was

6217.679 --> 6233.84
secretly loaded

6243.84 --> 6247.84
could be george sanford

6267.92 --> 6275.84
wow again that sounds really dark

6278.0 --> 6289.84
the sweater is real

6281.52 --> 6289.84
the [ __ ]

6297.6 --> 6303.84
oh okay good for you voynich

6308.239 --> 6317.839999999999
okay again

6349.04 --> 6359.84
good don't do that

6365.679 --> 6373.84
yeah it's not a crossbow

6375.199 --> 6382.879999999999
and if i know you then you

6378.48 --> 6387.839999999999
should know not to ask that question

6382.88 --> 6387.84
it's really annoying

6397.52 --> 6402.96
right so a newbie might come in and just

6401.04 --> 6405.04
just ask that question yeah that's not

6402.96 --> 6408.08
you though

6405.04 --> 6410.639
you need fonza you definitely do know so

6408.08 --> 6410.639
you are now

6412.84 --> 6415.84
trolling

6454.84 --> 6457.84
so

6469.44 --> 6474.239
no red pill trill sorry i already got

6482.84 --> 6485.84
one

6509.199 --> 6513.759999999999
yeah but i'm gonna run out the show soon

6511.679 --> 6517.4400000000005
anyway

6513.76 --> 6517.4400000000005
it's been good

6518.0 --> 6524.4
and yes i agree iron 26

6521.199 --> 6526.32
it does seem like trolls are

6524.4 --> 6527.839999999999
kind of getting a little bit more blunt

6526.32 --> 6530.4
i think that

6527.84 --> 6533.6
even tiny womble would agree to it who

6530.4 --> 6535.759999999999
is like one of the first ballers

6533.6 --> 6537.84
to actually get here in the chat and

6535.76 --> 6539.52
really stay and stay well behaved i

6537.84 --> 6541.04
think that he agrees to that there's

6539.52 --> 6544.159000000001
just

6541.04 --> 6546.8
like more troll-ish ballers now

6544.159 --> 6549.36
having the balls to come in i guess or

6546.8 --> 6549.360000000001
attempt it

6551.76 --> 6554.96
should have been in orleans chat three

6553.52 --> 6557.119000000001
years ago yeah well back

6554.96 --> 6560.719
but that back then i didn't have as much

6557.119 --> 6562.639
control even over the chat

6560.719 --> 6564.4
or the internet in general i didn't know

6562.639 --> 6566.400000000001
really about the interface and yeah the

6564.4 --> 6568.239
trolls trolls trolls trolls

6566.4 --> 6570.239
and there were a lot of spam issues back

6568.239 --> 6572.718999999999
then

6570.239 --> 6575.759999999999
now there's a slow mode system that

6572.719 --> 6579.44
wasn't there back then

6575.76 --> 6580.96
slow mode solves a lot against like the

6579.44 --> 6584.4
real the

6580.96 --> 6584.4
like real spammers and [ __ ]

6585.92 --> 6590.88
