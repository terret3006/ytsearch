and i can sure use it

76.4 --> 79.84
a lot right now

82.08 --> 84.32
so

85.28 --> 87.84
today is

87.92 --> 93.52
gorgeous

89.68 --> 93.52000000000001
it's a real full summer's day

94.0 --> 96.56
it's a

96.799 --> 100.96000000000001
a mowing machine currently

99.2 --> 102.88000000000001
at work

100.96 --> 106.479
don't know if the

102.88 --> 110.19999999999999
mike is even picking up on that but

106.479 --> 110.2
it is very noisy

114.64 --> 119.68
right but yeah this seems to be no

117.04 --> 122.24000000000001
trails left behind today

119.68 --> 124.56
very little clouds and just nice and

122.24 --> 127.19999999999999
blue

124.56 --> 129.2
yesterday did end up really trailed up

127.2 --> 132.72
though

129.2 --> 132.72
like i tried to basically

132.959 --> 137.92000000000002
do the orgone effect

135.52 --> 140.4
and i think it did work to a limited

137.92 --> 143.44
extent but it was just yeah

140.4 --> 144.72
everything was hazed up

143.44 --> 147.28
in the evening

144.72 --> 149.92
quite a bit i hope they're gonna not do

147.28 --> 149.92
that today

153.04 --> 158.84
birds are taking a bath

155.36 --> 158.84
in there regularly

165.9 --> 168.99
[Music]

173.76 --> 176.76
right

184.319 --> 188.0
hello clutch first in chat

188.4 --> 191.28
christoffy

193.36 --> 196.48000000000002
welcome

194.48 --> 198.879
slow mo moon buggy

196.48 --> 200.79999999999998
good to see you

198.879 --> 203.84
where's the scientifically flattest

200.8 --> 206.72
stationary no no it's not

203.84 --> 209.36
this word scientific

206.72 --> 212.799
does not apply

209.36 --> 215.44000000000003
see flat and stationary are what is

212.799 --> 215.44
traits

215.519 --> 220.31900000000002
and those do not fall under the

217.84 --> 222.959
scientific method

220.319 --> 225.04
so scientific method only proves the

222.959 --> 227.599
cause of an effect

225.04 --> 229.12
by varying and manipulating the natural

227.599 --> 231.2
phenomenon

229.12 --> 234.0
presumed to be causing

231.2 --> 234.0
said effect

234.64 --> 241.83999999999997
now the earth beings flat and stationary

237.04 --> 241.84
and enclosed mind you are not scientific

242.799 --> 248.239
they're what is questions

245.2 --> 248.23899999999998
they fall under

248.799 --> 251.799
geometry

254.08 --> 256.56
mostly

257.12 --> 259.359
right

263.52 --> 267.56
hey seeking star wars

268.08 --> 271.59999999999997
patrol reporting for duty that's very

270.24 --> 274.08
welcome

271.6 --> 276.24
i think i could use some

274.08 --> 279.59999999999997
yesterday i i don't know man yesterday i

276.24 --> 279.6
was in such a bad mood

280.08 --> 284.479
and i hadn't even like noticed that

282.08 --> 286.4
until i had until the show was already

284.479 --> 288.0
underway

286.4 --> 291.59999999999997
i'm gonna try to do

288.0 --> 291.6
less agitated today

291.759 --> 296.56
but yeah i am having a bit of like

293.919 --> 298.96
weather transition issues like i'm not

296.56 --> 302.72
feeling all that super great because

298.96 --> 304.4
like the temperature just went up a lot

302.72 --> 306.72
quite

304.4 --> 309.71999999999997
rapidly

306.72 --> 309.72
so

313.28 --> 316.55999999999995
24 degrees right

317.12 --> 322.16
oh according to the prediction tomorrow

319.12 --> 322.16
is going to be even warmer

322.24 --> 327.68
and fridays 30 degrees god

329.6 --> 335.28000000000003
that's gonna be like that's probably

331.759 --> 335.28000000000003
going to be you know sure day then

335.759 --> 341.36
30 degrees jesus

338.88 --> 341.36
we'll see

343.12 --> 346.16
hey pgcnet

351.52 --> 355.52
so yeah

352.96 --> 358.79999999999995
i don't have any green tea today because

355.52 --> 362.639
it's just way too warm for that

358.8 --> 364.96000000000004
so i got water and a gusto energy drink

362.639 --> 367.36
maybe i'll take it i don't know i still

364.96 --> 368.79999999999995
have like an illuminati crossover but

367.36 --> 370.88
for some reason

368.8 --> 373.199
i wasn't all that hungry

370.88 --> 376.639
still not

373.199 --> 376.639
probably going to eat it later today

378.96 --> 381.84
just feel

389.919 --> 395.75899999999996
right anyway

392.4 --> 396.79999999999995
yesterday's flat earth debate was great

395.759 --> 399.28000000000003
and i think

396.8 --> 401.6
that everybody was had tendencies of

399.28 --> 402.63899999999995
being a little agitated yesterday on

401.6 --> 404.319
average

402.639 --> 406.479
but still the flat earth debate turned

404.319 --> 408.88
into a great show

406.479 --> 412.12
and it like the after show lasted pretty

408.88 --> 412.12
long too

418.91 --> 422.16900000000004
[Music]

424.8 --> 429.36
right but i'm gonna try to take it a bit

426.639 --> 429.36
easy today

429.68 --> 433.599
full moon

431.28 --> 435.28
yeah

433.599 --> 437.919
i thought so

435.28 --> 440.55999999999995
yesterday night by the way was a really

437.919 --> 442.639
odd sight i'm almost sorry i didn't like

440.56 --> 445.039
get my p900 out

442.639 --> 447.12
last minute and just film it

445.039 --> 449.44
was such a weird sight with like the

447.12 --> 453.44
full moon and there was like this this

449.44 --> 453.44
carpet of sheep clouds up there

453.919 --> 457.52
it's a really bizarre sight

459.599 --> 464.68
but interesting

461.039 --> 464.68
a terrible 306

490.4 --> 496.0
oh by the way if you want to see some

492.16 --> 498.96000000000004
silly comedy i think it's from india

496.0 --> 498.96
bumped into this

499.52 --> 502.96
this is comedian

501.44 --> 505.599
i think

502.96 --> 508.23999999999995
called adam w maybe you've heard of him

505.599 --> 508.24
at territ

508.8 --> 513.599
there's a lot of videos they're all very

510.4 --> 513.5989999999999
typically the same though

519.68 --> 523.56
but i thought it was funny

539.36 --> 545.12
i think i might be get

541.279 --> 546.959
get like a foot bath or something

545.12 --> 549.279
i think that might help

546.959 --> 553.4799999999999
i'm gonna get that right now i think

549.279 --> 553.48
then i'll do some good

664.8 --> 668.76
sorry for the hold up

682.72 --> 686.36
camera's still working

689.44 --> 692.0790000000001
yes it is

692.24 --> 694.72
all right

699.68 --> 702.88
ah you're yeah i thought you would you

701.6 --> 705.88
would have seen that there are three

702.88 --> 705.88
essays

743.44 --> 750.639
okay that's a little too cold

746.56 --> 750.6389999999999
or rather it's not hot enough

753.12 --> 758.92
as in

754.32 --> 758.9200000000001
tomorrow i'll probably get a foot bath

809.76 --> 814.72
right so anyway

812.32 --> 816.1600000000001
i was watching oh benjamin i finished up

814.72 --> 820.8000000000001
the uh

816.16 --> 824.24
gardner show like when he was on there

820.8 --> 824.24
really good as usual

825.92 --> 830.639
and i find it sometimes just amazing how

828.48 --> 833.1990000000001
much

830.639 --> 836.88
what they talk about

833.199 --> 836.88
in my own way i talk about

840.16 --> 845.4399999999999
like a couple of things not because i'm

842.16 --> 847.279
just not in that position but

845.44 --> 849.6800000000001
yeah it is

847.279 --> 851.76
remarkable at times really i like i'd

849.68 --> 853.519
really

851.76 --> 856.079
i think i'd like to meet like this

853.519 --> 857.839
gardner guy

856.079 --> 860.2399999999999
at some point that would be very

857.839 --> 862.72
interesting

860.24 --> 864.88
i think he could probably like really

862.72 --> 868.48
help me out with some tips

864.88 --> 872.32
like i get the feeling that he would

868.48 --> 872.32
know how to help me out in a way

874.639 --> 878.399
like with my person that is

879.279 --> 881.6
yeah

882.16 --> 887.199
but uh

884.399 --> 891.04
yeah apparently also uh yeah bitcoin has

887.199 --> 891.04
taken another massive plunge

891.6 --> 897.24
so that was owen benjamin's show from

894.24 --> 897.24
yesterday

898.72 --> 904.839
i had no idea because yeah but

900.8 --> 904.8389999999999
apparently that has happened

924.24 --> 928.0790000000001
twenty thousand five five what

930.16 --> 935.68
is that how much it plunged okay

933.839 --> 938.0
or is that i don't know

935.68 --> 941.4799999999999
like i'm not that interested i'm not

938.0 --> 941.48
keeping track

941.6 --> 946.639
but i do like to take notice when

944.32 --> 951.1600000000001
there's a giant dip of some kind because

946.639 --> 951.16
that's gonna influence a lot of people

959.92 --> 962.16
hmm

962.639 --> 965.9590000000001
right characteristics

981.839 --> 983.9200000000001
you

996.8 --> 1001.639
let's see i'm rounding around for a

998.639 --> 1001.639
second

1023.04 --> 1025.279
um

1027.039 --> 1029.679
anyhow

1030.48 --> 1036.48
so yeah i'm

1032.799 --> 1036.48
feeling a little better so

1036.88 --> 1042.959
what do you guys want to talk about

1040.16 --> 1042.959
and yeah

1047.679 --> 1051.52
like if it's something that i'm probably

1049.6 --> 1054.0
not gonna know about please don't just

1051.52 --> 1055.679
use shorts and assume that i know what

1054.0 --> 1058.0
it means

1055.679 --> 1060.64
i happen to know

1058.0 --> 1062.64
that btc

1060.64 --> 1066.44
is like a bitcoin

1062.64 --> 1066.44
short terminology

1076.24 --> 1079.559
all right anyway

1092.96 --> 1098.96
any feedback from yesterday's show

1096.88 --> 1102.0800000000002
except for

1098.96 --> 1104.799
gadget inspector

1102.08 --> 1109.84
just complaining that my anger is gonna

1104.799 --> 1109.84
send away all these people oh no

1118.08 --> 1124.08
i think that the word nano was inserted

1120.4 --> 1125.3600000000001
into her lexicon like the word virus

1124.08 --> 1128.559
uh

1125.36 --> 1131.12
yeah well yes

1128.559 --> 1134.24
i mean effectively but

1131.12 --> 1136.1599999999999
look the word virus is like a model

1134.24 --> 1138.24
conception

1136.16 --> 1140.88
based on yeah

1138.24 --> 1144.48
on a faulty concept

1140.88 --> 1148.0800000000002
but nano is basically like a size

1144.48 --> 1151.679
dash scale indicator

1148.08 --> 1157.1999999999998
so there is nanotechnology

1151.679 --> 1159.52
it's just that what they say it will do

1157.2 --> 1160.799
i'm not trusting any of that

1159.52 --> 1164.24
right

1160.799 --> 1166.8799999999999
but yeah there is extremely small almost

1164.24 --> 1169.6
like atomic

1166.88 --> 1169.6000000000001
technology

1172.799 --> 1176.84
dwarf okay

1174.559 --> 1180.8799999999999
that's

1176.84 --> 1180.8799999999999
interesting ramon hard

1184.08 --> 1191.24
all right it is basically just a

1186.64 --> 1191.24
fancy word for extremely small

1197.76 --> 1200.76
uh

1210.32 --> 1213.039
right but

1211.52 --> 1214.08
another word

1213.039 --> 1216.96
typical

1214.08 --> 1218.799
that is inserted like the word virus is

1216.96 --> 1222.4
quantum

1218.799 --> 1226.32
right quantum this quantum that

1222.4 --> 1228.64
especially because nano is just pretty

1226.32 --> 1230.8799999999999
widely understood as oh that means

1228.64 --> 1234.0
something really small

1230.88 --> 1237.2800000000002
but when people put the word quantum in

1234.0 --> 1238.559
front of something quantum tech or

1237.28 --> 1240.799
quantum

1238.559 --> 1244.3999999999999
phasing whatever

1240.799 --> 1248.1589999999999
that's purely technobabble and literally

1244.4 --> 1249.919
literally nobody not almost nobody in

1248.159 --> 1252.0800000000002
the world understand

1249.919 --> 1254.0800000000002
what quantum actually means

1252.08 --> 1256.559
they know nothing of the whole quantum

1254.08 --> 1257.76
mechanics they know absolutely nothing

1256.559 --> 1260.72
about it

1257.76 --> 1263.039
and if they know like the basics like oh

1260.72 --> 1265.3600000000001
double slit experiment

1263.039 --> 1266.96
then they don't understand it

1265.36 --> 1271.52
because if you're just gonna put the

1266.96 --> 1271.52
word quantum in front of something

1271.76 --> 1276.919
you're probably not understanding what

1273.84 --> 1276.9189999999999
it means

1278.72 --> 1283.76
word nano a great increase since the

1280.88 --> 1285.919
1990s well yeah it's not surprising i

1283.76 --> 1288.0
mean there's an entire industry that's

1285.919 --> 1290.0
getting like more miniature

1288.0 --> 1293.44
as time progresses that's the

1290.0 --> 1293.44
electronics industry

1293.6 --> 1299.76
right if nano applies somewhere

1297.36 --> 1302.6399999999999
it's like the electronics and computer

1299.76 --> 1302.64
chip industry

1302.88 --> 1307.8400000000001
and those have like really

1305.2 --> 1312.0
dived into the depths

1307.84 --> 1314.24
around the 90s still going

1312.0 --> 1316.72
right and then the claim of quantum

1314.24 --> 1318.72
computers came on and all that blah blah

1316.72 --> 1321.3600000000001
blah blah blah nobody knows what it

1318.72 --> 1321.3600000000001
actually is

1321.6 --> 1327.4399999999998
the generalized idea like oh it's

1325.28 --> 1330.3999999999999
it's a one and a zero at the same time

1327.44 --> 1332.559
undecided and then it just knows the

1330.4 --> 1336.3200000000002
outcome that's like the the most

1332.559 --> 1340.24
[ __ ] [ __ ] story i've ever heard

1336.32 --> 1345.24
nate no it's not true

1340.24 --> 1345.24
it's pure sci-fi blabbermouthing

1347.6 --> 1353.52
it was a small spike to use

1349.919 --> 1355.919
nano in 90 what

1353.52 --> 1355.9189999999999
okay

1356.32 --> 1361.039
why is that

1358.53 --> 1364.8799999999999
[Music]

1361.039 --> 1364.8799999999999
i can't explain that one

1372.64 --> 1375.64
okay

1383.679 --> 1387.96
nano is a car name oh yeah

1388.08 --> 1390.6399999999999
why not

1395.919 --> 1401.3200000000002
hello terminoid and

1398.08 --> 1401.32
hey toys

1418.159 --> 1423.6000000000001
what's nano eevee

1421.2 --> 1426.159
and hello now

1423.6 --> 1426.1589999999999
this is

1428.96 --> 1431.8400000000001
daniel robles

1434.08 --> 1440.52
right uh

1435.679 --> 1440.52
oh wait so what's already there

1446.88 --> 1450.96
i feel weird i've slept great

1451.279 --> 1456.84
but i still kind of feel a bit tired

1453.84 --> 1456.84
weird

1466.96 --> 1471.72
hmm all right gram bernard makes sense

1482.559 --> 1488.1589999999999
some people think atoms are a hoax right

1486.159 --> 1490.7990000000002
well there's some people that think that

1488.159 --> 1493.679
water is just an element so there's

1490.799 --> 1495.9189999999999
people that are just complete retards

1493.679 --> 1498.159
they have no idea what they're doing and

1495.919 --> 1500.5590000000002
they think that

1498.159 --> 1502.72
because they discovered that so many

1500.559 --> 1504.6399999999999
things are fake that means everything is

1502.72 --> 1507.2
fake and they now can just start making

1504.64 --> 1511.279
up whatever the [ __ ] they want

1507.2 --> 1513.52
like it's a sandbox with lots of lagos

1511.279 --> 1515.2
they're idiots and they're making

1513.52 --> 1516.8799999999999
everything harder

1515.2 --> 1518.4
when they do that

1516.88 --> 1521.679
they're just making everything more

1518.4 --> 1521.679
confusing for everybody

1522.64 --> 1528.96
so yeah i definitely do believe in the

1525.76 --> 1531.36
atomic theory

1528.96 --> 1531.3600000000001
and

1531.679 --> 1538.4
there's still mysteries about it right

1534.799 --> 1541.52
also the whole proton neutron electron

1538.4 --> 1543.52
it's a model

1541.52 --> 1545.44
it's too small

1543.52 --> 1547.9189999999999
to actually be

1545.44 --> 1548.799
tangibly provable

1547.919 --> 1552.159
but

1548.799 --> 1552.1589999999999
the model works out

1554.24 --> 1557.919
it is cross-referenced with endless

1556.72 --> 1560.919
chemistry

1557.919 --> 1560.919
experimentation

1565.039 --> 1569.76
that's still not entirely perfect

1567.279 --> 1572.08
there's still weird oddities like

1569.76 --> 1575.2
missing material

1572.08 --> 1577.6
all that in certain effects it is all

1575.2 --> 1579.6000000000001
very mysterious

1577.6 --> 1582.32
but on average i think that atomic

1579.6 --> 1584.6399999999999
theory is the most reliable

1582.32 --> 1586.799
model for matter

1584.64 --> 1589.8400000000001
also because it's just been worked out

1586.799 --> 1589.84
so extensively

1590.4 --> 1594.0800000000002
and

1591.919 --> 1595.919
the information and practical

1594.08 --> 1599.84
application that comes out of that

1595.919 --> 1599.8400000000001
knowledge is fast

1600.559 --> 1605.6
so there's definitely no need to revise

1604.159 --> 1609.4
chemistry

1605.6 --> 1609.3999999999999
if you know what i mean

1612.29 --> 1615.48
[Music]

1620.48 --> 1625.96
want to miss the quality of energy yeah

1622.559 --> 1625.96
you are mistaken

1626.799 --> 1630.48
quantum

1628.08 --> 1633.6789999999999
the word in itself what it literally

1630.48 --> 1635.279
actually signifies is

1633.679 --> 1638.0800000000002
an amount

1635.279 --> 1640.399
it's like a designated amount

1638.08 --> 1643.039
that's what quantum meets

1640.399 --> 1645.12
right quanta

1643.039 --> 1647.12
multiple

1645.12 --> 1650.2399999999998
units of an amount

1647.12 --> 1655.12
a quantum is basically like a unit of an

1650.24 --> 1656.3990000000001
amount a quantum right like a quantum

1655.12 --> 1660.32
of light

1656.399 --> 1660.32
packets of energy yeah sure

1660.96 --> 1664.88
that's what the word actually

1663.6 --> 1666.0
means

1664.88 --> 1667.7600000000002
but

1666.0 --> 1670.559
people use it

1667.76 --> 1673.679
they are actually referencing

1670.559 --> 1675.6789999999999
quantum mechanic experiments

1673.679 --> 1676.5590000000002
and then they don't understand that and

1675.679 --> 1679.76
that

1676.559 --> 1683.36
general misunderstanding is why it is so

1679.76 --> 1686.559
popular as like a wizard or sci-fi word

1683.36 --> 1689.4399999999998
because it is really bizarre

1686.559 --> 1691.36
and complicated

1689.44 --> 1692.72
surreal almost

1691.36 --> 1695.039
and people

1692.72 --> 1697.919
are mystified i don't know really how to

1695.039 --> 1699.36
place it so they just qualify it as

1697.919 --> 1701.76
quantum

1699.36 --> 1703.84
quantum mechanics stuff

1701.76 --> 1705.919
we don't get it it's really mysterious

1703.84 --> 1709.559
but probably everything is possible with

1705.919 --> 1709.5590000000002
it but we don't understand

1732.32 --> 1739.559
surprise that thing is like vibrating

1734.399 --> 1739.559
the [ __ ] out of the place making sick

1878.24 --> 1880.48
ah

1883.919 --> 1887.3600000000001
okay well i googled quantum and i was

1886.48 --> 1892.039
right

1887.36 --> 1892.039
because i know that's what it means

1895.2 --> 1899.519
and of course there's other things also

1897.36 --> 1901.76
called quantum

1899.519 --> 1904.72
basically technologies and all that

1901.76 --> 1908.799
named quantum right because it's so cool

1904.72 --> 1912.76
quantum it's like science oh

1908.799 --> 1912.76
so special now

1931.679 --> 1937.1200000000001
the cutting edge of science appears

1934.08 --> 1938.48
esoteric to laymen

1937.12 --> 1941.279
no

1938.48 --> 1941.279
no not really

1942.64 --> 1949.3600000000001
if by layman you're specifically me

1946.48 --> 1950.88
if you mean me because i am declared a

1949.36 --> 1952.8799999999999
layman

1950.88 --> 1956.5590000000002
yeah no it does not appear to be

1952.88 --> 1960.0
esoteric to me at all

1956.559 --> 1964.32
cutting edge of science isn't science

1960.0 --> 1964.32
it's technology it's engineering

1964.399 --> 1969.6
and it's not esoteric or mystical to me

1971.2 --> 1974.799
yeah

1972.72 --> 1976.799
i'm just aware

1974.799 --> 1978.399
through personal experience throughout

1976.799 --> 1979.279
my life

1978.399 --> 1981.4399999999998
that

1979.279 --> 1984.399
there's a lot of things like quantum

1981.44 --> 1985.1200000000001
mechanics and

1984.399 --> 1987.6789999999999
just

1985.12 --> 1990.0
a lot of technology that people have no

1987.679 --> 1992.64
idea what the [ __ ] it really is nor do

1990.0 --> 1994.64
they nor do they actually even want to

1992.64 --> 1996.3200000000002
really know

1994.64 --> 1998.3990000000001
they just want to feel like it's all

1996.32 --> 2003.0
super special and that the the

1998.399 --> 2003.0
technology will take care of everything

2004.64 --> 2008.72
yeah

2006.559 --> 2008.72
so

2009.84 --> 2016.72
there is no cutting edge of science

2013.2 --> 2018.559
there's only a scientific method

2016.72 --> 2020.88
but there's a cutting edge in

2018.559 --> 2025.24
technological application and

2020.88 --> 2025.24
development for sure

2070.72 --> 2074.5989999999997
hello by the way jd

2138.96 --> 2143.04
it seems mysterious to me

2143.28 --> 2145.8390000000004
okay

2148.56 --> 2152.88
what about it

2150.079 --> 2155.599
i mean if you were referencing yourself

2152.88 --> 2157.359
as a layman then okay

2155.599 --> 2159.6800000000003
fine

2157.359 --> 2163.04
what's mysterious about it

2159.68 --> 2164.3999999999996
you need me to explain anything

2163.04 --> 2169.2799999999997
i think i got a

2164.4 --> 2169.28
decent grasp on like a quantum mechanics

2170.96 --> 2178.4
i'm not entirely sure about the

2173.119 --> 2178.4
assertions or conclusions drawn from it

2180.64 --> 2184.56
but i've been exposed to plenty

2185.119 --> 2189.2000000000003
so i think i i

2187.119 --> 2193.88
pretty decently

2189.2 --> 2193.8799999999997
understand what it's all about

2239.119 --> 2244.96
or you could just leave it like that say

2242.24 --> 2246.24
oh it seems mysterious to me and then

2244.96 --> 2248.2400000000002
not

2246.24 --> 2252.0
not continue on

2248.24 --> 2254.56
not respond to the inquiry of that

2252.0 --> 2257.8
so that i don't really have a subject to

2254.56 --> 2257.7999999999997
talk about

2260.16 --> 2264.72
all right i'm here i'm here for you guys

2266.48 --> 2271.839
strict or mellow i'm here

2269.2 --> 2275.04
for you guys so yeah

2271.839 --> 2278.72
if you're not gonna connect

2275.04 --> 2278.72
then what am i supposed to do here

2282.24 --> 2286.8799999999997
just sit look at the chat and do nothing

2289.76 --> 2293.6800000000003
this is

2291.76 --> 2295.8390000000004
slow-motion but

2293.68 --> 2298.0
yeah that's hilarious

2295.839 --> 2299.2799999999997
i have no clue about quantum stuff

2298.0 --> 2300.96
because i'm

2299.28 --> 2303.119
three quarters

2300.96 --> 2305.2
total numpty

2303.119 --> 2308.4
i don't think so slow mo moon buggy i

2305.2 --> 2312.04
mean you're only a quarter not a quarter

2308.4 --> 2312.04
numty at best

2312.079 --> 2315.599
you have way too sharp an instinct to be

2314.4 --> 2320.079
considered

2315.599 --> 2320.079
like almost full numpty no way

2320.56 --> 2326.24
you pay too much attention to be that

2323.2 --> 2329.2
much numpty

2326.24 --> 2329.2
so i disagree

2331.2 --> 2336.64
you're working on it what you're

2333.04 --> 2340.44
actively trying to become a numpty why

2336.64 --> 2340.44
why would you do that

2347.359 --> 2350.48
can i dance

2350.72 --> 2356.48
technically yeah

2353.28 --> 2356.48
breakdance no

2356.88 --> 2362.56
i don't even know what i know what salsa

2359.68 --> 2365.68
is cha-cha

2362.56 --> 2369.52
[ __ ] i've never even heard of that

2365.68 --> 2371.7599999999998
right but if when i danced typically was

2369.52 --> 2373.92
on the golf scene and i just do kind of

2371.76 --> 2375.5200000000004
like free

2373.92 --> 2379.119
wavy

2375.52 --> 2381.7599999999998
like direct i become the e and become

2379.119 --> 2384.8
the living dancing equalizer of the

2381.76 --> 2388.0
music that's what i do it's the only

2384.8 --> 2390.4
real way that i dance

2388.0 --> 2392.24
i'm very good at it i called it shadow

2390.4 --> 2395.359
dancing

2392.24 --> 2396.56
it is basically sort of a shamanic thing

2395.359 --> 2399.68
that's why

2396.56 --> 2402.32
i only dance on music i like

2399.68 --> 2403.44
i'm never just gonna dance on whatever

2402.32 --> 2405.44
never

2403.44 --> 2407.68
like oh party oh everything was good oh

2405.44 --> 2411.04
but this song sucks okay well then i'll

2407.68 --> 2413.2
stop dancing then because i don't dance

2411.04 --> 2416.16
to music that sucks

2413.2 --> 2416.16
or is too gay

2420.16 --> 2422.48
right

2423.44 --> 2428.96
but i typically just get very wavy with

2426.0 --> 2430.96
my hands and all that

2428.96 --> 2433.2
yeah

2430.96 --> 2433.2
so

2434.319 --> 2439.44
shadow dancing so very mystical

2437.44 --> 2442.0
it does something

2439.44 --> 2444.2400000000002
you can transform the environment doing

2442.0 --> 2446.4
that the energy of it

2444.24 --> 2448.72
and i have

2446.4 --> 2450.8
but there's like oh there's a party oh

2448.72 --> 2454.56
there's a golf party

2450.8 --> 2456.0
80s or something or whatever a bit

2454.56 --> 2458.319
electro

2456.0 --> 2460.079
and everybody's just like

2458.319 --> 2462.0
we're golfing

2460.079 --> 2464.4
we don't want to do anything we're gonna

2462.0 --> 2466.079
mope here that's gothic right

2464.4 --> 2468.4
and then i just go like oh okay then

2466.079 --> 2470.5600000000004
i'll be the only one on the dance floor

2468.4 --> 2472.319
and i'm just gonna freaking shadow dance

2470.56 --> 2475.119
the [ __ ] out of the place with all the

2472.319 --> 2476.4
room in the world no shame

2475.119 --> 2478.48
no doubt

2476.4 --> 2481.6800000000003
and guess what happens

2478.48 --> 2485.76
yeah like one minute later everybody's

2481.68 --> 2485.7599999999998
filling the dance floor that's what i do

2489.2 --> 2494.7999999999997
i've ever been to a rave

2492.4 --> 2496.64
no not really

2494.8 --> 2499.92
well

2496.64 --> 2502.64
maybe like twice or something with haha

2499.92 --> 2505.52
my friend and naima when i said was

2502.64 --> 2505.52
still dating her

2506.079 --> 2514.5600000000004
it was sort of like a

2509.839 --> 2517.839
goa trans side trans hippie thing rave

2514.56 --> 2517.839
it was kind of a rave

2518.319 --> 2521.359
on on a boat

2521.44 --> 2528.079
and a big boat

2524.079 --> 2528.079
in the harbor of amsterdam

2528.48 --> 2532.04
that's about it

2536.8 --> 2543.8390000000004
i hate ballroom dancing class

2540.48 --> 2545.52
you lucky bastard i wish i had ballroom

2543.839 --> 2547.52
dancing class

2545.52 --> 2549.599
i wish i've had that

2547.52 --> 2551.7599999999998
dude

2549.599 --> 2553.44
that's lucky

2551.76 --> 2555.44
i mean how are you going to get that

2553.44 --> 2558.64
nowadays all you learn is how to

2555.44 --> 2560.48
freaking twerk and gay be gay that's

2558.64 --> 2562.4
that's what you can learn now in this

2560.48 --> 2565.599
age

2562.4 --> 2567.119
man ballroom dancing sounds pretty damn

2565.599 --> 2570.4
cool to me

2567.119 --> 2570.4
it was horrible why

2570.72 --> 2575.7599999999998
why was it horrible

2573.76 --> 2579.6800000000003
maybe if you just really didn't want to

2575.76 --> 2581.599
do it yet then it would be horrible

2579.68 --> 2584.0
i can imagine if you're not into it then

2581.599 --> 2586.8
it just sucks

2584.0 --> 2588.88
because it's all so strict by the rules

2586.8 --> 2590.6400000000003
and you have to do the right steps in

2588.88 --> 2592.6400000000003
the right moment and

2590.64 --> 2596.68
yeah if you're not into that it sucks i

2592.64 --> 2596.68
can i can imagine that

2601.35 --> 2606.8399999999997
[Music]

2621.04 --> 2625.839
yes

2622.8 --> 2628.7200000000003
it's finally gonna piss off

2625.839 --> 2628.72
not that i hate

2629.359 --> 2632.0789999999997
people that

2630.48 --> 2633.119
work like that it's just that that

2632.079 --> 2636.1600000000003
machine

2633.119 --> 2639.6800000000003
is vibrating like right into my room and

2636.16 --> 2639.68
it's making me nauseated

2640.16 --> 2643.359
so i'm really happy that he's gonna [ __ ]

2642.24 --> 2647.0789999999997
off now

2643.359 --> 2647.0789999999997
really really happy

2652.24 --> 2655.839
oh

2654.16 --> 2657.1189999999997
okay so yeah

2655.839 --> 2658.64
yeah

2657.119 --> 2662.2000000000003
yeah if you're nervous and all that you

2658.64 --> 2662.2
have it's gonna suck

2665.92 --> 2671.839
by the way you could have basically

2667.839 --> 2676.24
fixed that by wearing velvet gloves

2671.839 --> 2680.7599999999998
which are like not uncommon even to use

2676.24 --> 2680.7599999999998
for ballroom dancing and all that

2691.2 --> 2695.4399999999996
right but yeah being nervous about it

2693.119 --> 2696.7200000000003
that's not great

2695.44 --> 2700.2000000000003
i get it

2696.72 --> 2700.2
you were a mess

2708.88 --> 2713.359
i think that my parents did like teach

2711.2 --> 2715.68
me or my mother

2713.359 --> 2717.52
they mostly did teach me like basic

2715.68 --> 2719.68
ballroom dancing

2717.52 --> 2721.04
when i was still a teen and was gonna go

2719.68 --> 2723.5989999999997
to like a

2721.04 --> 2726.88
like a party on school and i just was

2723.599 --> 2729.04
like i don't know how to dance

2726.88 --> 2733.44
can you teach me and then i got some

2729.04 --> 2736.72
basic tips and i got it pretty quickly

2733.44 --> 2739.2000000000003
so i've never had like real official

2736.72 --> 2739.2
training

2741.76 --> 2747.8390000000004
such friend takes

2743.68 --> 2747.839
dancing classes which isn't all right

2749.28 --> 2752.28
cool

2768.72 --> 2771.2799999999997
right

2769.76 --> 2773.92
yeah akumu

2771.28 --> 2775.92
and slo-mo the whole point is is that

2773.92 --> 2776.8
you gotta own it

2775.92 --> 2779.119
right

2776.8 --> 2780.5600000000004
you gotta own that everybody's watching

2779.119 --> 2782.2400000000002
you

2780.56 --> 2783.599
you gotta own that you will make

2782.24 --> 2785.9199999999996
mistakes

2783.599 --> 2786.88
you just gotta own it and just be like

2785.92 --> 2791.28
yeah

2786.88 --> 2793.359
look at me everybody look at me dancing

2791.28 --> 2795.28
i'm doing my best

2793.359 --> 2796.72
and it's okay it's okay

2795.28 --> 2799.28
if i [ __ ] up

2796.72 --> 2802.3999999999996
because i'll correct it quickly and just

2799.28 --> 2803.52
don't be nervous about it right

2802.4 --> 2806.0
like

2803.52 --> 2808.56
who are those people anyway to really

2806.0 --> 2808.56
judge you

2811.52 --> 2816.64
dancing like that is mostly just a

2814.0 --> 2818.96
discipline and it requires training and

2816.64 --> 2820.16
it requires failure

2818.96 --> 2823.04
at first

2820.16 --> 2825.52
to figure out the mistakes and

2823.04 --> 2828.079
learn from them so

2825.52 --> 2829.7599999999998
just don't be nervous

2828.079 --> 2832.079
of course that's a little late for you

2829.76 --> 2835.76
now slow mo moon buggy since it happened

2832.079 --> 2835.76
like a long time ago i take it

2841.599 --> 2845.44
all right but the only way to really do

2843.28 --> 2848.7200000000003
it right is to be bold and to just own

2845.44 --> 2850.079
it like yeah i'm going to own this

2848.72 --> 2852.9599999999996
place

2850.079 --> 2852.96
with my dancing

2856.559 --> 2861.599
40 years ago right

2859.599 --> 2862.559
that no no not dance like nobody's

2861.599 --> 2864.8
watching

2862.559 --> 2867.52
dance like everybody's watching and it

2864.8 --> 2867.52
doesn't matter

2867.839 --> 2873.839
because you're awesome

2871.119 --> 2873.839
you're doing that

2879.92 --> 2883.839
i mean if you're just if you're too

2882.24 --> 2885.68
nervous

2883.839 --> 2888.72
you can't stop the nerves like in the

2885.68 --> 2890.64
beginning yeah then maybe dance like

2888.72 --> 2893.2
like nobody's watching just imagine that

2890.64 --> 2896.0789999999997
you're alone there that might work but

2893.2 --> 2896.0789999999997
in the long run

2897.76 --> 2902.1600000000003
you then either stick to that that you

2900.24 --> 2904.4799999999996
always have to imagine that nobody's

2902.16 --> 2906.5589999999997
watching well what if somebody

2904.48 --> 2908.319
in the audience suddenly gets attention

2906.559 --> 2909.76
crappy well you're gonna snap out of

2908.319 --> 2912.079
that you're gonna suddenly be like oh

2909.76 --> 2914.4
[ __ ] people are watching right so it's

2912.079 --> 2916.559
better on the long run after you've

2914.4 --> 2919.76
overcome some of those nerves

2916.559 --> 2921.2000000000003
to just own it be like yeah everybody's

2919.76 --> 2923.76
watching

2921.2 --> 2923.7599999999998
so what

2924.24 --> 2927.5989999999997
who cares

2926.16 --> 2929.68
i'm doing this

2927.599 --> 2932.559
and i might make mistakes and i'll learn

2929.68 --> 2932.5589999999997
from those mistakes

2935.359 --> 2938.96
it's how i

2936.64 --> 2940.839
learned to dance in general because i

2938.96 --> 2943.76
was super

2940.839 --> 2945.599
nervous from being on the dance floor

2943.76 --> 2949.119
when i was younger and i had to like

2945.599 --> 2951.3590000000004
actively train that out of me

2949.119 --> 2953.359
like in my teens because i was just

2951.359 --> 2955.52
hyper nervous

2953.359 --> 2956.4
and i didn't want to be because i am

2955.52 --> 2959.52
pretty

2956.4 --> 2961.839
i'm a very flexible dexterous kind of

2959.52 --> 2963.2
person it was much more when i was

2961.839 --> 2966.0789999999997
younger even

2963.2 --> 2967.7599999999998
kind of like getting stiff

2966.079 --> 2970.1600000000003
a little bit more

2967.76 --> 2972.8
it's hyper flexible and i'm very good at

2970.16 --> 2975.359
dancing so there's just no reason

2972.8 --> 2978.7200000000003
to be nervous about it for me

2975.359 --> 2978.72
and i still had to overcome it

2999.839 --> 3006.5589999999997
but come on guys like ballroom dancing

3002.559 --> 3009.44
on like good classical walsh music

3006.559 --> 3012.3190000000004
that's pretty epic

3009.44 --> 3013.839
if you could bear that style of music

3012.319 --> 3016.16
it's pretty epic

3013.839 --> 3016.16
to me

3024.839 --> 3031.2
it quantum computing will get suppressed

3028.8 --> 3034.079
no no ben white

3031.2 --> 3036.0789999999997
no it will not get suppressed it was

3034.079 --> 3039.52
made up

3036.079 --> 3041.28
there is no quantum computing

3039.52 --> 3042.72
it's [ __ ]

3041.28 --> 3044.079
it's just

3042.72 --> 3047.2799999999997
smaller

3044.079 --> 3049.079
faster that's all it's not oh look at

3047.28 --> 3052.3190000000004
the special

3049.079 --> 3054.8
mysterious unknown

3052.319 --> 3058.4
thingy that'll know everything ahead of

3054.8 --> 3060.96
time no that's science fiction [ __ ]

3058.4 --> 3063.6800000000003
it's science fiction [ __ ] it's never

3060.96 --> 3065.68
been actually demonstrated it's a little

3063.68 --> 3066.96
wizard trick

3065.68 --> 3070.16
it's fake

3066.96 --> 3071.839
quantum computing is fake it doesn't

3070.16 --> 3074.0
exist

3071.839 --> 3075.7599999999998
never has it's always been a science

3074.0 --> 3079.359
fiction myth

3075.76 --> 3083.119
very eagerly grabbed onto

3079.359 --> 3085.2
by the sci-fi community as soon as the

3083.119 --> 3087.52
idea came up

3085.2 --> 3087.52
yeah

3089.04 --> 3091.68
it's fake

3093.839 --> 3098.72
quantum computing is about as real as

3096.16 --> 3100.5589999999997
nuclear bombs

3098.72 --> 3104.16
it's fake

3100.559 --> 3104.1600000000003
it's a science fiction myth

3105.52 --> 3110.88
and the myth is there to make you think

3108.16 --> 3113.52
that computers are like god they're all

3110.88 --> 3116.8
we don't understand it's so complex the

3113.52 --> 3120.16
computer has become the god

3116.8 --> 3122.559
that's what quantum computing

3120.16 --> 3125.04
does to the mind

3122.559 --> 3127.3590000000004
as a science fiction story it makes you

3125.04 --> 3130.0
think like wow computer man they're so

3127.359 --> 3132.64
mystery they are

3130.0 --> 3135.44
how can they know things allegedly

3132.64 --> 3137.359
before it was even like

3135.44 --> 3139.44
entered in the computer like dude

3137.359 --> 3141.7599999999998
there's so many myths about quantum

3139.44 --> 3144.079
computing it's all [ __ ] and it's all

3141.76 --> 3147.119
there just to make you think that

3144.079 --> 3149.119
computers are now getting smarter than

3147.119 --> 3151.359
people when there's this mystery of

3149.119 --> 3152.48
quantum computing it's all

3151.359 --> 3153.5989999999997
[ __ ]

3152.48 --> 3157.48
all of it

3153.599 --> 3157.48
it's all horse [ __ ]

3158.8 --> 3162.069
[Music]

3168.8 --> 3173.599
not making it about yourself can help oh

3171.359 --> 3175.52
yeah a renault cable of course but that

3173.599 --> 3178.48
all depends on what are you going to do

3175.52 --> 3181.2
with it like what share what motivates

3178.48 --> 3184.4
you the most sharing music

3181.2 --> 3185.839
or being a special boy

3184.4 --> 3188.1600000000003
well

3185.839 --> 3189.68
if being a special boy motivates you

3188.16 --> 3190.8799999999997
more then you're probably going to be

3189.68 --> 3193.04
doing that

3190.88 --> 3195.839
and that's going to turn you into that

3193.04 --> 3195.839
type of guy

3196.559 --> 3200.2400000000002
right

3198.48 --> 3202.72
so

3200.24 --> 3203.9199999999996
either good work no nuclear weapons are

3202.72 --> 3205.2799999999997
not real

3203.92 --> 3208.76
moderator

3205.28 --> 3208.76

3219.119 --> 3222.4
no suck

3220.4 --> 3224.8
sub

3222.4 --> 3224.8
fake

3225.599 --> 3230.4
you want to defend nuclear weapons as a

3228.0 --> 3233.52
real thing

3230.4 --> 3234.839
bring an actual account be a person

3233.52 --> 3240.44
discuss it with

3234.839 --> 3240.44

3256.64 --> 3260.1189999999997
all righty kumu

3268.079 --> 3272.559

3270.48 --> 3274.8
shorts i happen to know what these

3272.559 --> 3277.0400000000004
shorts mean but i just don't appreciate

3274.8 --> 3281.319
it when you do that

3277.04 --> 3281.319
just spell it out

3281.38 --> 3284.579
[Music]

3299.44 --> 3303.92
yes arenacle will i get that

3301.76 --> 3306.559
i'm just saying

3303.92 --> 3308.2400000000002
there are those types of pianists

3306.559 --> 3310.7200000000003
for example

3308.24 --> 3313.4399999999996
that are like oh look at me i'm special

3310.72 --> 3314.9599999999996
i'm so extravagant oh look at how quick

3313.44 --> 3317.68
i am

3314.96 --> 3320.0

3317.68 --> 3322.5589999999997
[ __ ]

3320.0 --> 3325.44
so yeah there is a market for special

3322.559 --> 3328.1600000000003
boy performance

3325.44 --> 3329.68
they're like oh look at me i'm so good

3328.16 --> 3332.799
right

3329.68 --> 3334.96
just as there is probably a wider market

3332.799 --> 3337.04
for people that are just there to like

3334.96 --> 3339.359
want to experience good music

3337.04 --> 3341.92
and so they'll want a performer that

3339.359 --> 3344.96
focuses on that too and not about how

3341.92 --> 3344.96
special boy they are

3346.319 --> 3351.68
acronyms yes sure i call them shorts

3349.2 --> 3351.68

3444.079 --> 3447.92
and then they lift it all the way to the

3445.839 --> 3449.52
top and they just start throwing giant

3447.92 --> 3452.2400000000002
piles of cash at it

3449.52 --> 3454.319
they want the special boys

3452.24 --> 3456.9599999999996
that's why the special boys always like

3454.319 --> 3456.96
rise up

3457.44 --> 3461.599
right

3458.319 --> 3463.599
act look look how full the world is with

3461.599 --> 3466.1600000000003
actual musicians

3463.599 --> 3468.079
that nobody's ever heard of and then

3466.16 --> 3471.44
when you hear something from them you're

3468.079 --> 3474.4
like what the hell this is really good

3471.44 --> 3477.04

3474.4 --> 3478.4
the world is full of that

3477.04 --> 3480.64
those people

3493.2 --> 3497.7599999999998
top they just shove it up there

3495.76 --> 3502.6400000000003

3523.359 --> 3527.4
it's their form of advertisement

3533.92 --> 3538.0
it's all artificial

3536.559 --> 3540.4
all of it

3538.0 --> 3541.44
as soon as the money stops so does the

3540.4 --> 3543.599
gay

3541.44 --> 3547.2000000000003
to that level

3543.599 --> 3548.6400000000003
really it's all financialized fagginess

3547.2 --> 3552.839
all of it

3548.64 --> 3552.839
it's all funded [ __ ]

3558.079 --> 3562.6400000000003
like pay to be gay

3560.4 --> 3564.559

3562.64 --> 3568.68
uh

3564.559 --> 3568.6800000000003
people are subjected to

3572.0 --> 3575.28
you need the talent to pull up yeah well

3573.92 --> 3578.319
there's

3575.28 --> 3581.0400000000004
thousands hundreds of thousands of

3578.319 --> 3582.24
really talented musical talented people

3581.04 --> 3585.64
out there

3582.24 --> 3585.64
and they're great

3592.559 --> 3599.8390000000004
right they want the [ __ ] they want that

3596.24 --> 3602.24
[ __ ] to shove money at it and use it as

3599.839 --> 3605.4
advertisement to encourage more people

3602.24 --> 3608.319
especially young people to also become

3605.4 --> 3610.4
professional facts

3608.319 --> 3613.119
and that's what it is

3610.4 --> 3615.839
i'm not gonna try to go back to my mood

3613.119 --> 3615.839
from yesterday

3616.88 --> 3620.2400000000002
i had enough of that already

3625.359 --> 3632.52
but it is what it is paid too gay

3628.96 --> 3632.52
that's what they're doing

3643.68 --> 3648.7599999999998
how much they paying

3645.599 --> 3648.76
a lot

3664.72 --> 3670.24
right and all you have to do for that

3667.2 --> 3672.8799999999997
is live the rest of your life in hell

3670.24 --> 3672.8799999999997
that's all

3679.92 --> 3684.0
yeah ralph rodriguez i'm glad you think

3682.079 --> 3686.799
it's funny i don't actually think it's

3684.0 --> 3689.2
funny although i guess i can imagine why

3686.799 --> 3691.44
it sounds kind of funny

3689.2 --> 3693.68
but that's what happens

3691.44 --> 3693.68
yeah

3694.799 --> 3698.88
certain type of bankers

3697.68 --> 3700.0
they pay

3698.88 --> 3701.28
to gain

3700.0 --> 3704.24
it's like oh

3701.28 --> 3706.559
oh oh you want to be big shot right well

3704.24 --> 3708.319
here is the list of things

3706.559 --> 3709.8390000000004
which you need to pick a couple of

3708.319 --> 3712.24
things from

3709.839 --> 3715.04
and then become that or you're not gonna

3712.24 --> 3715.04
get the loan

3715.2 --> 3720.319
pay too gay

3717.2 --> 3723.68
yeah it's real

3720.319 --> 3723.68
it actually happens

3724.88 --> 3728.48
i've it's been shoved in my face

3727.359 --> 3730.0789999999997
literally

3728.48 --> 3731.28
in the past

3730.079 --> 3734.319
literally

3731.28 --> 3737.2000000000003
i was rejected with certain things

3734.319 --> 3739.119
which i had ambitions for because i

3737.2 --> 3743.48
wasn't gay

3739.119 --> 3743.48
because i wasn't gay enough

3775.92 --> 3778.799
hello chris dick

3778.88 --> 3784.079
welcome to the chat

3782.319 --> 3786.96
flat earther took a long time to

3784.079 --> 3790.3590000000004
actually get to looking into it yeah

3786.96 --> 3790.359
i can imagine

3832.079 --> 3836.1600000000003
if we have too many bills to pay well

3834.4 --> 3838.48
yeah well it's

3836.16 --> 3840.16
it's very similar to the weimar republic

3838.48 --> 3841.039
situation

3840.16 --> 3844.0
right

3841.039 --> 3846.2400000000002
i mean look at like the whole explosion

3844.0 --> 3848.88
of pornography

3846.24 --> 3850.64
that came out of that when it really

3848.88 --> 3853.6400000000003
went down the [ __ ] financially

3850.64 --> 3853.64
remember

3854.48 --> 3860.48
it really went to [ __ ] and then

3857.2 --> 3863.7599999999998
there was a really bad pornography

3860.48 --> 3866.799
problem because yeah the poor people

3863.76 --> 3869.5200000000004
were being abused

3866.799 --> 3872.319
for that lured into oh we will get you

3869.52 --> 3875.44
money we'll get you what you need

3872.319 --> 3879.68
just do this one thing for us and do it

3875.44 --> 3879.68
again and again and again and again

3882.559 --> 3889.52
and that's

3884.88 --> 3889.52
what basically created the book burnings

3889.68 --> 3895.7599999999998
during hitler

3892.24 --> 3899.5989999999997
those were mostly porn

3895.76 --> 3902.4
that's not a joke it was mostly porn oh

3899.599 --> 3903.76
there happened to be a lot of

3902.4 --> 3906.839
books

3903.76 --> 3909.5200000000004
written by jews oh were they actually

3906.839 --> 3912.48
pornographers then pornographer jews

3909.52 --> 3914.48
yeah i can imagine why the world has not

3912.48 --> 3917.2
really changed all that much in 100

3914.48 --> 3917.2
years has it

3923.2 --> 3927.9199999999996
so pay too gay

3926.4 --> 3929.2000000000003
it's not the first time this is

3927.92 --> 3931.52
happening

3929.2 --> 3935.16
it happened a hundred years ago in

3931.52 --> 3935.16
germany as well

3937.28 --> 3944.3590000000004
and it was disgusting and it was pure

3939.76 --> 3944.3590000000004
abuse of the poor of the impoverished

3950.64 --> 3953.64
huh

3964.0 --> 3968.64
yeah that's a good one pornography

3967.68 --> 3970.0789999999997
yeah

3968.64 --> 3972.16
that's

3970.079 --> 3974.319
i mean i'm not gonna call my show that

3972.16 --> 3974.319
but

3975.119 --> 3981.119
i think that poor pornography is a

3977.92 --> 3981.119
pretty apt

3981.2 --> 3984.839
way to say it

3993.839 --> 3996.839
sake

3998.05 --> 4001.2290000000003
[Music]

4006.079 --> 4011.0
sextant offenders

4008.0 --> 4011.0
yeah

4036.4 --> 4043.92
sleep with real women well furthering us

4039.68 --> 4043.9199999999996
you mean real prostitutes

4069.92 --> 4073.52
yeah i wouldn't call prostitutes real

4072.24 --> 4076.8799999999997
women though

4073.52 --> 4079.44
yeah because they don't they're [ __ ]

4076.88 --> 4079.44
miserable

4080.64 --> 4084.319
and they probably yeah

4085.119 --> 4089.92
need prostitutes right

4087.52 --> 4092.16
and who knows man some of them probably

4089.92 --> 4093.599
do still watch more

4092.16 --> 4095.44
right

4093.599 --> 4097.759
i mean addiction

4095.44 --> 4100.4
is all over the place when you're rich

4097.759 --> 4102.799
because what the [ __ ] gonna stop you

4100.4 --> 4104.48
not your money

4102.799 --> 4106.88
right

4104.48 --> 4109.44
so a lot of them do just end up freaking

4106.88 --> 4112.0
sex addicts and all that

4109.44 --> 4115.879999999999
and they don't sleep with women they

4112.0 --> 4115.88
sleep with prostitutes

4147.359 --> 4150.4890000000005
[Music]

4152.239 --> 4155.239
anything

4175.279 --> 4177.52
um

4180.719 --> 4185.44
well six look i

4182.56 --> 4187.52
i do need a model

4185.44 --> 4189.678999999999
it's just that

4187.52 --> 4191.359
i'm not gonna say

4189.679 --> 4194.159
oh look

4191.359 --> 4196.88
this is reality

4194.159 --> 4199.44
it's just oh this is my estimation of

4196.88 --> 4201.52
how things are really arranged the most

4199.44 --> 4203.28
likely and like from a designer's

4201.52 --> 4205.76
perspective this is how i would design

4203.28 --> 4207.5199999999995
it if i had these in these options

4205.76 --> 4208.8
available to me

4207.52 --> 4210.8
yeah

4208.8 --> 4214.159000000001
and that's a model

4210.8 --> 4216.56
but i'm not gonna say it is that

4214.159 --> 4218.879999999999
because there's still

4216.56 --> 4221.04
evidence that would need to be gathered

4218.88 --> 4224.159000000001
in order to confirm whether that is

4221.04 --> 4224.159
actually real or not

4224.719 --> 4227.92
right

4226.48 --> 4230.959999999999
just like the whole frustrating

4227.92 --> 4233.4400000000005
situation every time everybody laughs at

4230.96 --> 4235.12
me over at fpd for me declaring oh it's

4233.44 --> 4237.599999999999
a non-local

4235.12 --> 4239.44
hologram the celestials are non-local

4237.6 --> 4241.4400000000005
holograms and then they're like how do

4239.44 --> 4243.36
you prove that yeah i can't yeah i know

4241.44 --> 4245.5199999999995
yeah

4243.36 --> 4250.719
i can prove you that it's not physical

4245.52 --> 4250.719
and i can only imagine one alternative

4252.239 --> 4255.759999999999
and this is how it works

4257.76 --> 4264.159000000001
right so at least i do have a model

4260.96 --> 4265.44
it's just i'm not going to say this is

4264.159 --> 4268.96
reality

4265.44 --> 4270.0
because i don't know for sure

4268.96 --> 4272.56
it's

4270.0 --> 4276.36
my best estimation with the knowledge

4272.56 --> 4276.360000000001
available to me

4300.96 --> 4306.56
scientific models no that's not a

4303.6 --> 4306.56
scientific model

4307.04 --> 4310.88
that word is incorrect

4312.719 --> 4315.84
it's just a model

4318.32 --> 4323.92
it's not scientific model there's no

4321.679 --> 4326.84
establishment of a cause of an effect

4323.92 --> 4332.4400000000005
it's only a what is

4326.84 --> 4332.4400000000005
scenario that doesn't fall under science

4342.88 --> 4349.12
no it isn't grabernard you don't seem to

4345.6 --> 4352.56
be very informed about science

4349.12 --> 4354.0
are you new to this scene

4352.56 --> 4355.120000000001
have you ever watched a flat earth

4354.0 --> 4357.84
debate

4355.12 --> 4357.84
you should

4358.159 --> 4362.32
science

4359.679 --> 4366.8
is not about modeling it is about

4362.32 --> 4366.799999999999
establishing the cause of an effect

4366.88 --> 4372.719
you have to vary and manipulate as the

4369.52 --> 4375.4400000000005
experimenter the independent variable

4372.719 --> 4378.719
within the hypothesis which has to be a

4375.44 --> 4382.678999999999
naturally occurring phenomenon

4378.719 --> 4382.679
yeah flat earth debate

4386.88 --> 4391.1990000000005
also check out quantum eraser channel

4396.719 --> 4403.76
oh yeah yeah you're right seeking star

4399.12 --> 4403.76
wars derpcon for yeah correct

4411.679 --> 4418.4800000000005
yeah so grammar nard you're wrong

4415.6 --> 4418.4800000000005
kind of an idiot

4421.199 --> 4427.12
you don't know what science is

4423.12 --> 4428.239
you can't back those statements

4427.12 --> 4430.32
yeah

4428.239 --> 4432.32
science being

4430.32 --> 4433.44
the establishment of the cause of an

4432.32 --> 4435.04
effect

4433.44 --> 4437.599999999999
is quite

4435.04 --> 4439.44
well written down

4437.6 --> 4441.6
and backed by

4439.44 --> 4444.08
all universities

4441.6 --> 4447.1990000000005
because that is the scientific method

4444.08 --> 4450.199
and that is science it's all very well

4447.199 --> 4450.199
established

4468.719 --> 4474.56
why couldn't you do this why could you

4470.8 --> 4474.56
yeah because you can't

4474.88 --> 4478.719
why can't you do science on man-made

4476.64 --> 4480.719
stuff well you could do it on man-made

4478.719 --> 4483.04
stuff as long as the

4480.719 --> 4486.32
independent variable

4483.04 --> 4489.44
to presume to be causing the presumed

4486.32 --> 4489.44
cause of the effect

4489.84 --> 4496.4800000000005
it has to be naturally occurring right

4492.719 --> 4500.56
you can still use manmade devices

4496.48 --> 4501.36
as part of the experiment as long as

4500.56 --> 4502.719
the

4501.36 --> 4504.719
thing that you're going to very

4502.719 --> 4506.719
manipulate within the experiment

4504.719 --> 4510.159
experiment is a naturally occurring

4506.719 --> 4512.4
phenomenon and not a man-made device or

4510.159 --> 4517.04
a phenomenon that comes forth

4512.4 --> 4517.04
specifically from the man-made device

4517.12 --> 4520.719
that's natural science

4522.64 --> 4527.280000000001
right and if it's man-made stuff it's

4524.719 --> 4530.4800000000005
not science it's technology it's

4527.28 --> 4532.0
engineering it's not science if you

4530.48 --> 4535.04
don't understand that then you're

4532.0 --> 4537.76
extremely ill-informed

4535.04 --> 4540.56
and you're a fantasist you've went along

4537.76 --> 4542.88
on the giant hippie culture which is

4540.56 --> 4545.04
what it comes from hippie culture it's

4542.88 --> 4546.88
basically tavistock

4545.04 --> 4549.44
insertion

4546.88 --> 4551.52
with all that that's when it came right

4549.44 --> 4553.199
science it's now sciences it can be

4551.52 --> 4554.88
everything science is for everybody and

4553.199 --> 4557.199
everybody could do science

4554.88 --> 4559.12
oh look look at me do science i dropped

4557.199 --> 4562.5599999999995
something it dropped i could make an

4559.12 --> 4565.5199999999995
idea a model about it and that's science

4562.56 --> 4567.280000000001
no it isn't you're an idiot if you

4565.52 --> 4569.679
believe that

4567.28 --> 4571.199
it is the deliberate

4569.679 --> 4572.96
demolishing

4571.199 --> 4576.719
the foundations

4572.96 --> 4579.36
of actual science the discipline

4576.719 --> 4582.0
the method of science

4579.36 --> 4584.719
that's what they did

4582.0 --> 4587.44
as part of the hippie revolution

4584.719 --> 4591.52
and now it's all so popular everything

4587.44 --> 4592.839999999999
is science as long as it looks fancy

4591.52 --> 4596.56
it's not

4592.84 --> 4599.4400000000005
science none of that is science the only

4596.56 --> 4601.280000000001
thing that is science is the method

4599.44 --> 4603.759999999999
where you vary and manipulate the

4601.28 --> 4608.04
independent variable which has to be a

4603.76 --> 4608.04
naturally occurring phenomenon

4608.4 --> 4611.92
and then you establish the cause of the

4610.8 --> 4612.96
effect

4611.92 --> 4616.159
whether

4612.96 --> 4617.84
the manipulated phenomenon

4616.159 --> 4619.5199999999995
was affected

4617.84 --> 4622.0
or not

4619.52 --> 4624.719
so you always get a result you either

4622.0 --> 4627.52
prove or disprove

4624.719 --> 4629.44
the cause of the effect

4627.52 --> 4632.96
that's science

4629.44 --> 4636.199
that's the only thing

4632.96 --> 4636.199
it is

4652.159 --> 4656.5599999999995
how do you think second law of

4653.52 --> 4659.52
thermodynamics was discovered no

4656.56 --> 4661.679
had nothing to do with an engine

4659.52 --> 4663.4400000000005
second law of thermodynamics applies to

4661.679 --> 4667.679
everything

4663.44 --> 4668.719
it was figure it out and then test it

4667.679 --> 4671.04
is

4668.719 --> 4673.04
there something that that goes in the

4671.04 --> 4677.12
other direction

4673.04 --> 4680.48
where cold actually flows to hot

4677.12 --> 4683.84
right for example

4680.48 --> 4686.639999999999
where i yeah where low pressure actually

4683.84 --> 4688.8
builds up to high pressure

4686.64 --> 4690.64
naturally without some physical

4688.8 --> 4692.2390000000005
intervention right

4690.64 --> 4694.320000000001
that's how the second law of

4692.239 --> 4696.639999999999
thermodynamics was established here on

4694.32 --> 4696.639999999999
earth

4697.44 --> 4701.12
by testing everything

4701.28 --> 4705.96
not just oh a couple of devices

4715.36 --> 4721.92
no no that's wrong graminard second law

4719.199 --> 4722.799999999999
applies to everything that's why it's a

4721.92 --> 4725.36
law

4722.8 --> 4727.92
if it says according to you it doesn't

4725.36 --> 4731.44
apply to everything then it is an alloy

4727.92 --> 4731.4400000000005
you numpty [ __ ]

4731.76 --> 4736.96
stop blabbering like an adiq [ __ ] you

4735.28 --> 4740.239
don't know what the [ __ ] you're talking

4736.96 --> 4740.2390000000005
about you [ __ ]

4744.32 --> 4749.599999999999
laugh it up funny [ __ ] with

4747.52 --> 4751.1990000000005
a [ __ ] you don't know what the [ __ ]

4749.6 --> 4754.08
you're talking about

4751.199 --> 4757.12
it applies to everything real

4754.08 --> 4761.6
yeah oh it doesn't apply

4757.12 --> 4763.679
to a scenario a model that doesn't exist

4761.6 --> 4764.88
you say yeah

4763.679 --> 4765.92
oh okay

4764.88 --> 4766.88
right

4765.92 --> 4768.96
yeah

4766.88 --> 4771.76
no it doesn't apply to those things that

4768.96 --> 4773.28
don't exist that you can make up i'm

4771.76 --> 4777.400000000001
sure yeah

4773.28 --> 4779.759999999999
but it does apply to everything in

4777.4 --> 4782.879999999999
reality though

4779.76 --> 4782.88
numpty [ __ ]

4785.36 --> 4792.32
there is no open system you [ __ ]

4789.52 --> 4794.96
[ __ ] that was my point

4792.32 --> 4799.44
it doesn't apply to an open system which

4794.96 --> 4803.04
we don't have you [ __ ] [ __ ]

4799.44 --> 4806.159
we don't have an open system we have gas

4803.04 --> 4808.96
pressure that means we don't have an

4806.159 --> 4812.5199999999995
open system you get it the numpty dip

4808.96 --> 4812.52
[ __ ] come on

4819.28 --> 4824.719
an engine is a man-made device

4822.239 --> 4826.239
and besides it's not open it has

4824.719 --> 4829.04
compartments

4826.239 --> 4831.44
it has a pressure system it builds up

4829.04 --> 4833.28
pressure and it releases that pressure

4831.44 --> 4835.5199999999995
but it still has it

4833.28 --> 4835.5199999999995
yeah

4836.08 --> 4838.48
so

4836.96 --> 4841.12
the earth is not

4838.48 --> 4843.839999999999
an open system

4841.12 --> 4846.4
second law of thermodynamics applies to

4843.84 --> 4848.159000000001
all things all things

4846.4 --> 4850.799999999999
and by the way where the [ __ ] are you

4848.159 --> 4853.759999999999
even getting this nonsense from it

4850.8 --> 4856.639
doesn't apply to an open yes it [ __ ]

4853.76 --> 4859.6
does you numpty [ __ ]

4856.639 --> 4862.2390000000005
it applies to everything it applies to

4859.6 --> 4867.719
everything that's real that's why it's a

4862.239 --> 4867.718999999999
law of nature you [ __ ] idiot

4884.0 --> 4891.28
oh my god

4887.28 --> 4894.639
who the [ __ ] are you you numpty [ __ ]

4891.28 --> 4897.92
get the [ __ ] out of my chat

4894.639 --> 4898.88
with your [ __ ] assertions

4897.92 --> 4901.12
i mean

4898.88 --> 4901.12
like

4901.36 --> 4906.159
you're not even interesting as a

4903.76 --> 4908.96
fantasist [ __ ] talker you're not

4906.159 --> 4912.32
even interesting you're just the [ __ ]

4908.96 --> 4914.4800000000005
[ __ ] white trash piece of [ __ ] from

4912.32 --> 4916.719
down the street that blabbers off and

4914.48 --> 4919.12
nobody listens because you're a [ __ ]

4916.719 --> 4921.12
[ __ ] and you don't even need to know

4919.12 --> 4923.36
about reality and how things work in

4921.12 --> 4928.44
order to figure that one out about you

4923.36 --> 4928.44
you [ __ ] numpty [ __ ]

4936.239 --> 4942.08
god

4937.36 --> 4945.12
what a [ __ ] unbelievable derpcon 5

4942.08 --> 4948.8
derpcon 5 absolutely that's why it's

4945.12 --> 4952.28
been no there is no derpcon 7

4948.8 --> 4952.28
goes to 5.

4970.4 --> 4975.679
yeah and i'm talking to you too devil's

4972.48 --> 4978.799999999999
that forget you [ __ ] [ __ ]

4975.679 --> 4981.52
what the hell is wrong with you lol lol

4978.8 --> 4983.1990000000005
get the [ __ ] out of here lol

4981.52 --> 4984.639
pure [ __ ]

4983.199 --> 4987.638999999999
lies

4984.639 --> 4987.639
deceiver

4989.679 --> 4992.679
deceiver

4998.53 --> 5001.759999999999
[Music]

5015.76 --> 5020.96
hey [ __ ] with your band that means you

5019.04 --> 5023.6
don't make sock account it means you're

5020.96 --> 5026.88
banned get the [ __ ] out of my chat you

5023.6 --> 5028.400000000001
miss informant piece of [ __ ]

5026.88 --> 5031.04
[ __ ] off

5028.4 --> 5035.07
you're not welcome here anymore

5031.04 --> 5040.999
disgusting liar

5035.07 --> 5040.999
[Music]

5044.4 --> 5047.96
eat this now

5065.84 --> 5068.84
um

5075.12 --> 5078.12
um

5084.27 --> 5088.879000000001
[Music]

5090.719 --> 5093.04
wow

5095.28 --> 5099.12
see

5096.32 --> 5102.719
even akuma virus here gets it

5099.12 --> 5102.719
and he is like a numpty

5108.639 --> 5114.2390000000005
just goes to show how

5110.84 --> 5115.84
incredibly [ __ ] this [ __ ] is

5114.239 --> 5119.36
grammar nerd

5115.84 --> 5122.639
nards devil's advocate what a bunch of

5119.36 --> 5126.239
fantasists loser freaks

5122.639 --> 5131.2390000000005
you're filthy liars

5126.239 --> 5131.239
people should beat you in the streets

5159.36 --> 5165.639
hot tar and feathers arguably chicken

5161.76 --> 5165.639
strawberry that would work

5170.239 --> 5175.839999999999
or just straight on napalm

5172.78 --> 5175.84
[Music]

5176.159 --> 5180.28
and do everybody a favor

5181.86 --> 5185.04
[Music]

5188.239 --> 5191.239
um

5207.199 --> 5211.799999999999
tauren feathers will be making a

5208.8 --> 5211.8
comeback

5216.48 --> 5219.48
maybe

5226.32 --> 5228.88
i don't know

5229.44 --> 5233.44
i think it's kind of gross i think that

5231.12 --> 5236.239
just putting them in like a

5233.44 --> 5236.239
in the stock

5236.88 --> 5239.679
basically the wooden it come trap and

5238.719 --> 5243.04
then just

5239.679 --> 5243.04
like publicly shaming

5246.0 --> 5251.08
that would probably uh

5248.08 --> 5251.08
defies

5253.6 --> 5257.52
i mean

5255.12 --> 5260.08
i don't think there's enough feathers in

5257.52 --> 5262.2390000000005
the world right now to basically

5260.08 --> 5267.239
provide

5262.239 --> 5267.239
for all these numpty [ __ ] out there

5267.28 --> 5270.96
i mean there's probably not going to be

5268.56 --> 5273.04
a tar shortage

5270.96 --> 5275.92
but i mean

5273.04 --> 5277.6
that's a lot of feathers

5275.92 --> 5280.159
and feathers are kind of like an

5277.6 --> 5281.52
industrial commodity it would be a waste

5280.159 --> 5284.839999999999
to use them

5281.52 --> 5284.84
i think

5299.44 --> 5302.44
right

5308.719 --> 5311.84
good point akumu

5314.8 --> 5318.0
right

5316.0 --> 5322.679
and like chicken feathers aren't like

5318.0 --> 5322.679
industrially used even are they

5322.96 --> 5326.56
they use different type of feathers for

5324.639 --> 5328.2390000000005
that or

5326.56 --> 5330.4800000000005
whatever it is

5328.239 --> 5331.599999999999
whatever you call it so yeah maybe maybe

5330.48 --> 5333.599999999999
it would work

5331.6 --> 5336.719
the chickens out there there's still

5333.6 --> 5339.280000000001
plenty of chicken feathers

5336.719 --> 5342.32
they're mostly just recycled so

5339.28 --> 5342.32
maybe it could work

5342.719 --> 5345.96
good one

5351.04 --> 5355.36
newton's law of gravity

5355.679 --> 5360.32
now there was no

5357.84 --> 5365.1990000000005
law of gravity there was only

5360.32 --> 5366.4
a law of gravity in his model

5365.199 --> 5371.12
a thing

5366.4 --> 5371.12
that he basically said this is an axiom

5371.44 --> 5377.12
you need the law of gravity for

5374.56 --> 5380.719
everything to work right but newton's

5377.12 --> 5384.88
law like that was only within his model

5380.719 --> 5387.28
it was not a natural law it was a law

5384.88 --> 5389.1990000000005
within his model

5387.28 --> 5392.5599999999995
which is incorrect by the way because it

5389.199 --> 5394.4
excludes gas pressure behavior yeah it

5392.56 --> 5396.4800000000005
is officially

5394.4 --> 5399.839999999999
it's wrong his model is wrong and

5396.48 --> 5402.638999999999
newton's law within his model is

5399.84 --> 5405.360000000001
therefore wrong it's not a natural law

5402.639 --> 5406.400000000001
it never was a natural law it was always

5405.36 --> 5409.36
a law

5406.4 --> 5411.44
within his model

5409.36 --> 5415.639
it's not the same

5411.44 --> 5415.638999999999
it isn't real

5428.08 --> 5432.4
newton didn't have a theory that's

5429.84 --> 5435.6
correct he disclaimed the scientific

5432.4 --> 5438.4
hypothesis concerning gravity adamantly

5435.6 --> 5441.1990000000005
officially written in

5438.4 --> 5443.12
in letters yes

5441.199 --> 5444.159
very wise of him

5443.12 --> 5445.92
because

5444.159 --> 5448.799999999999
well his law

5445.92 --> 5451.92
and his model were wrong and he knew it

5448.8 --> 5454.4800000000005
it was basically an attempt a playful

5451.92 --> 5458.639
attempt to model things out

5454.48 --> 5458.638999999999
and it didn't work it was not complete

5458.8 --> 5464.88
right he did not

5461.199 --> 5467.44
yet comprehend or figure out relative

5464.88 --> 5467.4400000000005
density

5470.56 --> 5475.52
that's probably that relative density as

5473.04 --> 5477.44
an officially recognized system came

5475.52 --> 5479.120000000001
later

5477.44 --> 5481.678999999999
it might have been figured out like

5479.12 --> 5485.599999999999
thousands of years ago too

5481.679 --> 5485.6
but like within modern

5486.32 --> 5491.5199999999995
like

5487.36 --> 5493.36
western history and like engineering and

5491.52 --> 5495.6
scientific community it was figured out

5493.36 --> 5498.639
probably later

5495.6 --> 5498.639
or rediscovered

5498.8 --> 5503.12
what was wrong with his model he

5500.719 --> 5505.44
excluded gas behavior that's what's

5503.12 --> 5509.44
wrong with his model

5505.44 --> 5510.32
yeah entire gravity model assumes

5509.44 --> 5512.4
that

5510.32 --> 5516.48
well gas doesn't expand in all

5512.4 --> 5516.48
directions to fill the available volume

5517.04 --> 5522.48
it treats gases as a fluid

5520.639 --> 5525.52
like a liquid

5522.48 --> 5530.08
within the model

5525.52 --> 5532.8
and thereby excluding gas behavior

5530.08 --> 5535.5199999999995
within his model newton's model gas

5532.8 --> 5536.400000000001
behavior is not accounted for the only

5535.52 --> 5539.1990000000005
way

5536.4 --> 5541.199
it is even addressed

5539.199 --> 5544.08
in any way

5541.199 --> 5545.28
is when friction

5544.08 --> 5546.8
of air

5545.28 --> 5549.28
is included

5546.8 --> 5553.0
that's the only way it was accounted for

5549.28 --> 5553.0
within newton mechanics

5561.199 --> 5565.759999999999
what part of what the [ __ ] are you

5563.28 --> 5570.5599999999995
talking about i never i never said that

5565.76 --> 5574.4800000000005
he said that it's a natural fact

5570.56 --> 5577.679
do you know newton mechanics newtonian i

5574.48 --> 5581.759999999999
do it excludes gas behavior i figured

5577.679 --> 5584.159
this out when i was 16 okay i figured

5581.76 --> 5586.4800000000005
this out when i was 16.

5584.159 --> 5586.48
yeah

5586.56 --> 5590.88
a long freaking ass time ago

5591.28 --> 5597.12
i knew that back then

5594.56 --> 5600.56
that it was incomplete

5597.12 --> 5602.159
my freaking teacher literally told me in

5600.56 --> 5605.360000000001
private because he didn't want to say

5602.159 --> 5605.36
that in front of the class

5605.92 --> 5611.36
he told me about relative density or

5608.639 --> 5613.6
just density he called it density the

5611.36 --> 5616.32
actual thing is density gravity isn't

5613.6 --> 5618.08
real it's a model it's from newton it

5616.32 --> 5620.239
doesn't actually work and then there's

5618.08 --> 5622.639
einstein gravity but that's just purely

5620.239 --> 5624.08
mathematical i back then didn't yet

5622.639 --> 5626.400000000001
understand that if it's purely

5624.08 --> 5628.0
mathematical that means it's not real i

5626.4 --> 5630.719
didn't understand that yet i thought

5628.0 --> 5634.32
that math was reality so that was still

5630.719 --> 5636.719
very confusing but i already learned

5634.32 --> 5640.96
that newton

5636.719 --> 5644.4
excludes gas behavior within his model

5640.96 --> 5646.719
he assumed the model assumed

5644.4 --> 5648.638999999999
that it is like a fluid and that it goes

5646.719 --> 5650.719
down goes boom boom

5648.639 --> 5653.36
just like liquids

5650.719 --> 5653.36
it doesn't

5654.08 --> 5659.04
it expands in all directions to avail to

5656.719 --> 5661.52
fill the available volume and newton

5659.04 --> 5663.28
never accounted for that

5661.52 --> 5665.679
he didn't and that's a naturally

5663.28 --> 5667.84
establishable fact you can literally go

5665.679 --> 5670.84
through his formula and figure that out

5667.84 --> 5670.84
yourself

5681.92 --> 5687.679
i'll give a [ __ ] if relative density is

5684.96 --> 5690.159
not officially recognized i don't give a

5687.679 --> 5692.0
fleeting [ __ ]

5690.159 --> 5692.879999999999
thursday vegan

5692.0 --> 5695.52
bag

5692.88 --> 5698.32
i don't give a [ __ ] about that

5695.52 --> 5702.159000000001
it's scientific fact

5698.32 --> 5704.5599999999995
it is repeatable demonstrable scientific

5702.159 --> 5706.719
fact we don't give a [ __ ] if the

5704.56 --> 5709.1990000000005
majority of the world doesn't recognize

5706.719 --> 5712.4800000000005
that they can go [ __ ] themselves blow

5709.199 --> 5715.678999999999
yourselves up you piece of [ __ ] lying

5712.48 --> 5717.919999999999
cock-sucking satan [ __ ] okay

5715.679 --> 5720.719
i don't give a [ __ ] if you don't

5717.92 --> 5723.1990000000005
recognize relative density theory it is

5720.719 --> 5726.0
scientifically established fact and

5723.199 --> 5727.04
there's nothing you can do about that

5726.0 --> 5729.36
[ __ ]

5727.04 --> 5732.08
you hear that [ __ ]

5729.36 --> 5733.04
there's nothing you can do to stop that

5732.08 --> 5737.84
fact

5733.04 --> 5740.8
that it is scientific fact repeatable

5737.84 --> 5740.8
you can do it

5740.96 --> 5746.8
i don't care if it's not recognized go

5743.84 --> 5746.8
[ __ ] yourself

5747.44 --> 5754.4
it is repeatable demonstrable scientific

5751.76 --> 5757.360000000001
fact you can go [ __ ] yourself if you

5754.4 --> 5761.04
don't like it you hear it [ __ ]

5757.36 --> 5763.44
go suck satan's [ __ ] and do it somewhere

5761.04 --> 5764.639
else because you're banned in here hear

5763.44 --> 5766.719
me [ __ ]

5764.639 --> 5769.1990000000005
[ __ ] off

5766.719 --> 5772.08
it's scientific fact and there's nothing

5769.199 --> 5775.04
you can do about it everybody can do

5772.08 --> 5777.92
that experiment everybody has it water

5775.04 --> 5781.5199999999995
everybody has a glass everybody has salt

5777.92 --> 5781.52
and everybody can get an egg

5781.679 --> 5786.719
everybody can do the experiment and

5784.8 --> 5789.360000000001
prove that it works

5786.719 --> 5793.679
exactly according to the scientific

5789.36 --> 5797.5599999999995
method and there is nothing you can do

5793.679 --> 5797.56
about it

5801.199 --> 5803.919999999999
and with that i'm gonna round out the

5802.96 --> 5806.159
