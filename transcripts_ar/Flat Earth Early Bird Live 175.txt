30.35 --> 33.399
[Music]

36.56 --> 41.96
[Music]

65.67 --> 71.93900000000001
and I yeah you could even hear that

68.2 --> 76.119
because I was muted so yeah I'd I had

71.939 --> 81.08999999999999
accidentally a page opened as part to

76.119 --> 88.99
hang out the vote thingy and then I

81.09 --> 91.77000000000001
forgot that it itself would play so yeah

88.99 --> 98.89
a bit of a messy start there let's see

91.77 --> 105.64
if I can fix this right so this let's

98.89 --> 108.209
see which one is it okay and it's gonna

105.64 --> 108.209
take a while

115.63 --> 123.31
there there he go

119.5 --> 128.08
okay yep

123.31 --> 131.12
so yeah that was a sloppy start good

128.08 --> 134.93
morning welcome to Flat Earth

131.12 --> 138.62
early-bird number 175 I'm your host

134.93 --> 141.82
Arwen and usually I don't have such a

138.62 --> 145.61
messy start so my apologies for that and

141.82 --> 148.91
before we start the show please don't

145.61 --> 151.67000000000002
forget to share share share it any

148.91 --> 153.53
platform you see fit and if you haven't

151.67 --> 155.20899999999997
already subscribed to my channel and hit

153.53 --> 157.7
the bell notifications so you know when

155.209 --> 162.41
I'm going live which is 2 p.m.

157.7 --> 165.2
Amsterdam time right so the weather

162.41 --> 166.73
today is yeah that's pretty decent it's

165.2 --> 169.31
a little bit better than yesterday it's

166.73 --> 173.51
kind of the same but not windy at all

169.31 --> 176.18
and it's not raining like few drops

173.51 --> 180.32
sometimes like solitaire drops that's

176.18 --> 183.92000000000002
about it it's not very sunny though but

180.32 --> 186.38
I've had moments where so leader there

183.92 --> 188.67999999999998
is a an open spot and the Sun comes

186.38 --> 191.35999999999999
through and actually kind of Pleasant so

188.68 --> 197.06
every day different day in spring in the

191.36 --> 198.65
Netherlands so right now I don't have to

197.06 --> 200.51
talk about the votes anymore because

198.65 --> 206.08
you're gonna literally see them go up

200.51 --> 206.07999999999998
and off live so you can already see

207.549 --> 213.37
what's going on considering that let's

210.59 --> 213.37
see who is in chat

213.87 --> 217.18
[Music]

218.16 --> 226.04999999999998
all right so we got Dan Winfield who

221.61 --> 229.92000000000002
popped by quite early and drunken bullet

226.05 --> 231.24
for one one Robert slaughter all right

229.92 --> 235.48999999999998
yeah

231.24 --> 240.27
seem to be interested in Medini Voynich

235.49 --> 248.15
beer and skittles young class Shaw

240.27 --> 260.0
Steve low okay and I don't know this is

248.15 --> 260.0
Major Tom water Clements alright X 320

261.049 --> 267.78
so yeah good to see you all

263.37 --> 271.41
I got a class on today as promised a

267.78 --> 277.97999999999996
regular one so thanks again for the

271.41 --> 278.43
super chat donation I also got some

277.98 --> 282.45000000000005
coffee

278.43 --> 284.45
and of course tea but I don't know

282.45 --> 287.67
recently I've been getting up so early

284.45 --> 290.27
like this is the fourth day in a row

287.67 --> 293.46000000000004
that I've just got up at 8 o'clock

290.27 --> 296.60999999999996
automatically like my alarm clocks set

293.46 --> 300.59999999999997
to 11 but I just get up because I also

296.61 --> 302.91
get go to bed quite early just I just

300.6 --> 305.55
crash and I'm like okay I could try to

302.91 --> 307.17
keep myself awake or just go to sleep

305.55 --> 310.23
and actually get a really good night

307.17 --> 313.65000000000003
rest and yeah when I'm really

310.23 --> 315.84000000000003
preoccupied with creative stuff or just

313.65 --> 318.29999999999995
like really zoned into like watching a

315.84 --> 320.76
series then it's really hard to resist

318.3 --> 323.52000000000004
that and then I tend to break through

320.76 --> 328.5
stay up late mess up my rhythm but I

323.52 --> 330.9
haven't been doing that so yeah that's

328.5 --> 333.36
why I get coffee pretty early but then

330.9 --> 335.96999999999997
as soon as the show pretty much arrives

333.36 --> 337.98
I feel like yeah I kind of do want

335.97 --> 341.04
coffee but I'll need something to eat

337.98 --> 343.68
with it otherwise it's gonna kind of

341.04 --> 345.36
mess up my metabolism so I got coffee

343.68 --> 349.189
and it cuts all

345.36 --> 349.189
it's a good morning

360.55 --> 365.53000000000003
yeah by the way if you're thirsty I

362.889 --> 372.22
don't recommend coffee doesn't actually

365.53 --> 374.34
exactly help against thirst green tea

372.22 --> 377.79
does though

374.34 --> 377.78999999999996
[Music]

394.37 --> 397.569
[Music]

405.65 --> 409.77
yeah Walter Clemons I don't know really

408.24 --> 420.84000000000003
who you are this is the first time I've

409.77 --> 423.08
seen you in my chat okay all right so as

420.84 --> 423.08
expected

425.36 --> 442.56
yeah you don't go trolling on me no

431.1 --> 445.17
[ __ ] please yeah lucky for me this

442.56 --> 448.11
is actually lunch but over in the US

445.17 --> 455.58000000000004
especially in the West Coast it's six

448.11 --> 457.95
o'clock now so either on my show from

455.58 --> 463.83
that side I get the really really early

457.95 --> 469.21999999999997
birds like chocolate for example it's a

463.83 --> 469.21999999999997
really really guy working all day or

469.31 --> 475.41
Rasta for example that's been up all

472.35 --> 479.52000000000004
night because he does that every now and

475.41 --> 484.35
then or in a couple is consecutively in

479.52 --> 486.41999999999996
a row so I am aware of like the time

484.35 --> 488.73
schedule of pretty much everyone more

486.42 --> 493.23
and more like having been dealing with

488.73 --> 495.62
this transatlantic YouTube movement it

493.23 --> 499.86
just makes me very aware of the time

495.62 --> 504.81
eventually like I have my own time

499.86 --> 506.58000000000004
feeling but I kind of tune in now more

504.81 --> 508.62
and more with other people and I feel

506.58 --> 510.53999999999996
like yeah it's slightly offset there

508.62 --> 515.01
TuneIn is slightly different and I get a

510.54 --> 516.9
better feel for it eventually I think it

515.01 --> 519.63
will even help me more and more to just

516.9 --> 524.72
predict what kind of state they will be

519.63 --> 524.72
in depending on their time zone

529.529 --> 539.879
and right uh Walter Clemons like fire

535.54 --> 544.5999999999999
trucks scooty and monster trucks okay

539.879 --> 547.0600000000001
well I don't know this is not really the

544.6 --> 552.509
show to discuss that kind of thing I

547.06 --> 555.31
think you you might want to look for

552.509 --> 555.819
channels that talk about that kind of

555.31 --> 559.0889999999999
stuff

555.819 --> 563.62
because I talk about science and

559.089 --> 569.339
pseudoscience and alternative history

563.62 --> 569.339
and a lot of conspiracy and yeah

572.73 --> 577.8000000000001
when I talk about is not for the

574.89 --> 582.38
faint-hearted in general I do try to be

577.8 --> 582.38
gentle with what I talk about but I

585.08 --> 591.09
consider myself to be pretty hardcore

588.12 --> 594.6
but just not in the tone but with the

591.09 --> 597.63
subjects I deal with I I do challenge

594.6 --> 600.99
myself constantly to to treat subjects

597.63 --> 605.45
that are risky that are scary and try to

600.99 --> 608.82
give it some sensible approach somehow

605.45 --> 611.34
so that you can talk about it even

608.82 --> 614.97
entertain ideas coming from those

611.34 --> 618.45
thought angles without being

614.97 --> 620.73
contaminated by the other elements that

618.45 --> 623.88
are present in that way of thinking or

620.73 --> 625.71
in the original foundational motivations

623.88 --> 629.52
or anything and I find that fascinating

625.71 --> 632.37
it's I don't know I guess it's almost a

629.52 --> 634.71
necessary skill to be doing that as a

632.37 --> 638.16
game master because I have to drum up

634.71 --> 640.98
entire cultures that are different or in

638.16 --> 644.55
more situations and kind of make it I

640.98 --> 647.4300000000001
have to be able to understand the

644.55 --> 649.89
motivations of it all and how they think

647.43 --> 653.13
how they would respond individually to

649.89 --> 656.52
things and just conjure forth entire

653.13 --> 659.79
group dynamics virtually in the

656.52 --> 664.67
experience of my players and myself of

659.79 --> 664.67
the story so I need to do that

674.57 --> 682.6700000000001
tinfoil stuff hilarious isn't it so

679.28 --> 685.67
funny you know that the original tin

682.67 --> 687.62
foil had what what it how it came up I

685.67 --> 692.74
think it came up like in the 70s or

687.62 --> 695.54
something so weird but it is related to

692.74 --> 699.71
originally to protect from mind-control

695.54 --> 706.87
which was presumably caused by radio

699.71 --> 712.01
interference and it's so funny because

706.87 --> 713.66
it's been like cartoon of I'd almost a

712.01 --> 717.86
bit like the blue man with colloidal

713.66 --> 721.91
silver but much wider as like a the

717.86 --> 723.95
tinfoil hat is like the fools hat of the

721.91 --> 726.38
modern culture do you understand

723.95 --> 729.22
it's the fools hat of the modern

726.38 --> 731.84
sculpture that's what they made it into

729.22 --> 735.01
kind of like the original fools hat

731.84 --> 740.7800000000001
pretty much is a wizard hat it's like a

735.01 --> 746.03
pylon it's also a weird like taking away

740.78 --> 747.77
the the power that a hat can have that

746.03 --> 751.0699999999999
and there is something weird too that

747.77 --> 755.39
something psychological and energy why

751.07 --> 758.57
it's very complicated but yeah the

755.39 --> 760.64
tinfoil hat and the idea was it was

758.57 --> 764.09
supposed to protect you from that

760.64 --> 766.43
influence well the idea was sort of a

764.09 --> 771.9200000000001
Faraday cage but the funny or the silly

766.43 --> 773.6899999999999
thing is that yeah of course it's unless

771.92 --> 777.3499999999999
you're gonna wrap your entire head into

773.69 --> 783.3800000000001
it you could be approached from from

777.35 --> 785.72
below so it's still the concept was not

783.38 --> 787.61
really worked out all that well and

785.72 --> 790.37
that's kind of the funny silly thing

787.61 --> 794.42
about it it's people just trying [ __ ]

790.37 --> 796.34
out and then everybody rides with it

794.42 --> 800.66
because it kind of sounds kind of like

796.34 --> 803.36
okay that could sorta work you know many

800.66 --> 806.06
people are very easy in trying to trying

803.36 --> 807.6
to conceptualize new ideas if it's

806.06 --> 812.2199999999999
interesting to them

807.6 --> 816.9200000000001
so the seventies but the tinfoil hat

812.22 --> 818.73
does could potentially kind of work

816.92 --> 823.38
that's the funny thing

818.73 --> 827.82
and we even know that for example if you

823.38 --> 831.42
have allergy to to electromagnetism

827.82 --> 834.9300000000001
for example of Wi-Fi systems or radio

831.42 --> 837.99
towers which are while my opinion proven

834.93 --> 841.68
to be damaging directly very measurably

837.99 --> 843.3
with direct symptoms nervousness and all

841.68 --> 844.8599999999999
kinds of things if you're extra

843.3 --> 848.2199999999999
sensitive to it I've known people like

844.86 --> 850.77
that and they actually you either paint

848.22 --> 852.8100000000001
coats it's kind of expensive your entire

850.77 --> 857.4499999999999
room have to be very meticulous or you

852.81 --> 861.5999999999999
put a layer of tinfoil over it and maybe

857.45 --> 864.21
yeah then put something else over that

861.6 --> 866.82
maybe paint or whatever but and that

864.21 --> 870.33
really does measurably work they have

866.82 --> 873.08
devices to measure the influence and it

870.33 --> 876.3000000000001
really does work and that's funny

873.08 --> 881.2800000000001
because the tinfoil hat is still the

876.3 --> 885.92
symbol of the modern fool see how that

881.28 --> 885.92
is wizardry just by itself

891.16 --> 898.99
it's just like Oh a conspiracy theorist

894.31 --> 900.9399999999999
is crazy well we know the conspiracy

898.99 --> 905.38
theorist is like even postmodern it's

900.94 --> 907.87
the 21st century born really when it was

905.38 --> 909.85
mainstreamed the concept of conspiracy

907.87 --> 913.48
theories by the tinfoil hat ER is kind

909.85 --> 916.84
of like the preset to that it's the

913.48 --> 919.86
evolution it's made more technical more

916.84 --> 924.22
technical about the ways of thinking

919.86 --> 926.5600000000001
more to that angle not just trying weird

924.22 --> 930.75
kooky things out but it started with the

926.56 --> 930.75
tinfoil hat isn't that interesting

931.29 --> 935.05
because we all use all these

933.46 --> 937.87
terminologies for granted because

935.05 --> 940.0
immediately resonates in some way we all

937.87 --> 942.34
been conditioned to just use that to go

940.0 --> 944.14
with it whatever pops up if it's somehow

942.34 --> 948.96
sticks you go with it it becomes

944.14 --> 948.96
normalized yeah

960.51 --> 967.079
right well there is an issue to that by

963.48 --> 971.79
the way truth is truth and that is that

967.079 --> 978.3
people that are really sensitive to to

971.79 --> 980.76
radiation that they can actually become

978.3 --> 984.779
paranoid because of it and the problem

980.76 --> 987.5
is is it even enhances each other it

984.779 --> 990.329
really does but people can and this is

987.5 --> 993.06
officialy yeah there are people around

990.329 --> 995.0999999999999
the world that have that that do become

993.06 --> 997.0189999999999
so paranoid about it that they truly

995.1 --> 999.4490000000001
become miserable and they isolate

997.019 --> 1002.329
themselves and lock themselves up to

999.449 --> 1005.149
protect themselves against the phone

1002.329 --> 1010.4899999999999
radiation or it does happen and that is

1005.149 --> 1014.87
a paranoid reaction but it often starts

1010.49 --> 1017.9590000000001
with truly do feeling it do having

1014.87 --> 1022.82
influenced by it and that it does

1017.959 --> 1030.52
amplify paranoia itself that's the issue

1022.82 --> 1030.52
to what what does that mean

1045.13 --> 1051.7600000000002
oh come on

1048.93 --> 1054.54
okay well sure we'll talk about Flat

1051.76 --> 1057.07
Earth I guess kind of sick of this

1054.54 --> 1060.28
social engineering stuff that's really

1057.07 --> 1063.36
to the core of much of how people learn

1060.28 --> 1063.36
in the world right

1063.58 --> 1068.98
woven into that network through our

1067.09 --> 1070.6
experiences in life through how we grew

1068.98 --> 1074.89
up but I guess flat earth

1070.6 --> 1076.3899999999999
sure right so a container for gas

1074.89 --> 1077.98
pressure there has to be a container

1076.39 --> 1080.0200000000002
first there is the container then

1077.98 --> 1082.54
there's the gas pressure and then sets

1080.02 --> 1086.26
in the gradient that is the natural

1082.54 --> 1089.8899999999999
order of all things in this regard in

1086.26 --> 1096.31
the regard of gas pressure beginning

1089.89 --> 1101.47
middle and end results container gas

1096.31 --> 1105.84
pressure gradient so the thing is a dome

1101.47 --> 1114.13
a dome would be a very simple

1105.84 --> 1117.33
straightforward grasp graspable like a

1114.13 --> 1121.3000000000002
palpable thing we could imagine and

1117.33 --> 1123.79
miniaturize so that could solve the the

1121.3 --> 1127.27
dome could indeed solve a container but

1123.79 --> 1131.05
it depends on the entire nature of the

1127.27 --> 1134.91
realm itself so a dome is not the only

1131.05 --> 1137.9199999999998
way to establish a container if the

1134.91 --> 1140.2
realm itself has looping elements to it

1137.92 --> 1143.8300000000002
and there's simply a special limited

1140.2 --> 1146.41
confine that those limited confines will

1143.83 --> 1149.83
serve equally as the container as all

1146.41 --> 1153.3100000000002
the gas pressure laterally pushes

1149.83 --> 1158.29
against itself and thus creating an

1153.31 --> 1160.72
equilibrium state of equilibrium within

1158.29 --> 1164.05
the limited confine as long as there is

1160.72 --> 1168.07
some kind of cutoff point or it works

1164.05 --> 1171.1599999999999
even weirder but yeah there's just

1168.07 --> 1173.3999999999999
certain conditions that can definitely

1171.16 --> 1177.3000000000002
create a container without B

1173.4 --> 1179.93
without it being literally a cup over

1177.3 --> 1179.93
our world

1180.35 --> 1185.9099999999999
so that's my understanding of the

1182.79 --> 1187.92
container of this world which there

1185.91 --> 1191.93
definitely is or there would not be a

1187.92 --> 1191.93
gradient that would not be gas pressure

1197.09 --> 1203.49
right okay no there we go again

1200.49 --> 1205.29
you guys always want the same thing over

1203.49 --> 1208.2
and over and over and over and over and

1205.29 --> 1210.0
over and over again don't you oh my god

1208.2 --> 1213.6000000000001
how many times do we have to explain

1210.0 --> 1217.89
this right so how does the pressure

1213.6 --> 1220.62
gradients come into being right well it

1217.89 --> 1222.39
does so by displacement and whether the

1220.62 --> 1226.4699999999998
cause what the cause of that

1222.39 --> 1229.17
displacement is the division as I used

1226.47 --> 1232.26
to conceptualize it the things separate

1229.17 --> 1234.5700000000002
into the dense and the less dense or

1232.26 --> 1236.67
they have even the less heavy before I

1234.57 --> 1239.3999999999999
understood more the technical side of it

1236.67 --> 1243.3600000000001
and it really is the density and you

1239.4 --> 1246.51
could presuppose there is a gravity

1243.36 --> 1249.75
causing this division but provably so it

1246.51 --> 1252.39
is actually caused by ya relative

1249.75 --> 1256.31
density and relative density causes

1252.39 --> 1259.3500000000001
displacement in the mass if that

1256.31 --> 1261.8999999999999
separated or combined piece of mass is

1259.35 --> 1265.08
in this equilibrium in relation to

1261.9 --> 1268.44
everything surrounding it as long as it

1265.08 --> 1270.84
has maneuverability and that is how it

1268.44 --> 1276.3600000000001
works it's always like that and whatever

1270.84 --> 1281.1599999999999
causes the displacement the gradient as

1276.36 --> 1283.59
it manifests is technically unclear why

1281.16 --> 1285.39
does relative density split in that the

1283.59 --> 1288.6
way it does it does it doesn't answer

1285.39 --> 1291.24
that it simply does not but it can be

1288.6 --> 1293.85
scientifically proven that it is caused

1291.24 --> 1298.77
in a very specific way and that is the

1293.85 --> 1300.61
relative density division within the

1298.77 --> 1303.95
gradient

1300.61 --> 1307.52
the spectrum a spectrum of relative

1303.95 --> 1313.42
density so that's how it works I hope

1307.52 --> 1313.42
that sufficiently answers your question

1319.59 --> 1327.6799999999998
okay mark open up I haven't seen that

1322.08 --> 1327.6799999999998
clip I I'll check it out

1330.57 --> 1337.32
but in yeah check it out I'll actually

1333.48 --> 1341.1200000000001
just post it in my early bird chat on

1337.32 --> 1341.12
skype and have a look at it later cuz

1341.96 --> 1346.47
let's see what time for video it is gas

1344.73 --> 1352.29
pressure without a container all right

1346.47 --> 1355.98
it is a flick through of like a drawing

1352.29 --> 1358.05
board with text okay right well I can

1355.98 --> 1361.58
just outright explain it so thanks for

1358.05 --> 1361.58
the assistance but I think I can manage

1373.68 --> 1380.52
all right indeed Theo Megawati earth is

1377.46 --> 1382.5
in needed dynamic system and there's

1380.52 --> 1394.16
temperature influences which has a

1382.5 --> 1394.16
cascade effect of lichen

1396.359 --> 1404.4189999999999
waves how to describe it it's like the

1400.469 --> 1404.419
world oscillates it's like the seasons

1406.429 --> 1413.519
and it's all tied in to one another like

1410.129 --> 1415.589
the temperature difference from the Sun

1413.519 --> 1418.2
basically what it causes on the land

1415.589 --> 1421.259
what causes in the air how that all

1418.2 --> 1425.729
interacts and the Sun strength and how

1421.259 --> 1429.299
that that difference in strength causes

1425.729 --> 1431.3690000000001
a difference in in yeah in the entire

1429.299 --> 1435.229
atmosphere and what happens what goes on

1431.369 --> 1439.7389999999998
it but it's I think it's pretty pretty

1435.229 --> 1442.529
much Sun bound entirely so it's almost

1439.739 --> 1444.269
entirely irrelevant what we as humans

1442.529 --> 1446.489
pretty much do except for yeah we could

1444.269 --> 1451.259
still poison everything that's the

1446.489 --> 1454.219
biggest problem but other than that it's

1451.259 --> 1457.169
pretty much the Sun so yeah that's why I

1454.219 --> 1461.789
definitely do not agree with manmade

1457.169 --> 1465.3290000000002
climate change it's ridiculous actually

1461.789 --> 1469.049
I have quite the contrary I contrary an

1465.329 --> 1477.149
idea that that because plants thrive on

1469.049 --> 1481.789
co2 so anyway just wandered off into

1477.149 --> 1481.789
another subject let's get let's see

1492.62 --> 1502.76
who mysteric electricity right yeah

1497.99 --> 1504.26
there's so much about it but the setup

1502.76 --> 1509.929
of this world it's incredibly

1504.26 --> 1513.799
complicated okay

1509.929 --> 1515.9
casual spaceman how is it the Sun does

1513.799 --> 1521.36
not change in angular size throughout

1515.9 --> 1525.23
the day right well because in my view

1521.36 --> 1528.3799999999999
and how I see it it's a holographic

1525.23 --> 1531.83
phenomena that is pretty much only

1528.38 --> 1534.71
apparently in its angular position in

1531.83 --> 1536.3899999999999
relation to the observer so the angular

1534.71 --> 1540.74
relation is really the only thing we

1536.39 --> 1546.5590000000002
have and it seems to be consistent like

1540.74 --> 1548.57
a clock but a holographic clock and

1546.559 --> 1551.1789999999999
that's what I think that yeah the

1548.57 --> 1554.649
heavens are and it's been referenced

1551.179 --> 1554.6490000000001
like that in in the past

1557.82 --> 1563.34
so I don't think the Sun is any physical

1560.609 --> 1565.499
object in a specific location up there

1563.34 --> 1570.32
in the heavens I think that light

1565.499 --> 1576.119
manifests through some bizarre mechanism

1570.32 --> 1579.72
into our realm but in relation to the

1576.119 --> 1581.759
observer and that makes light heavenly

1579.72 --> 1585.059
light very mysterious phenomena by

1581.759 --> 1587.879
itself because yeah I've tried to

1585.059 --> 1591.869
explain it before I think that depending

1587.879 --> 1595.4089999999999
on your location on the earth if you

1591.869 --> 1597.2389999999998
could somehow visually keep a line of

1595.409 --> 1602.46
sight with one another over huge

1597.239 --> 1604.44
distances then yeah I propose that the

1602.46 --> 1608.099
Sun would be at different locations to

1604.44 --> 1610.46
each and they would see the shadows in

1608.099 --> 1617.1589999999999
relation to the position of the Sun as

1610.46 --> 1619.83
they see it and it would be different as

1617.159 --> 1622.529
they look at the other of somehow a

1619.83 --> 1624.96
giant telescope whatever then they would

1622.529 --> 1627.149
see the Sun differently then as the

1624.96 --> 1630.509
shadow by that person differently as

1627.149 --> 1632.5189999999998
that person sees the shadow by

1630.509 --> 1635.58
themselves because the Sun to them isn't

1632.519 --> 1637.889
it I think I proposed that it's

1635.58 --> 1640.2289999999998
literally a holographic in relation to

1637.889 --> 1645.859
the position of observation itself

1640.229 --> 1649.259
basically sounds very surreal I know but

1645.859 --> 1651.9289999999999
yeah this is this makes sense to me yeah

1649.259 --> 1654.809
doesn't exactly make things less

1651.929 --> 1657.029
complicated I know but I'll keep on

1654.809 --> 1662.129
trying to extrapolate on this and

1657.029 --> 1664.919
explain it further over the the times

1662.129 --> 1668.7489999999998
why the daily show so I could get back

1664.919 --> 1671.429
to this multiple times and I have so

1668.749 --> 1675.029
anyway that's what I think about the Sun

1671.429 --> 1677.3990000000001
I completely discard the concept that it

1675.029 --> 1680.609
may be a physical object in a specific

1677.399 --> 1683.0089999999998
location causing that light like a lamp

1680.609 --> 1685.2289999999998
as we know lamps here physically on

1683.009 --> 1687.059
earth and have confirmation of their

1685.229 --> 1687.73
location and approachability and all

1687.059 --> 1690.69
that

1687.73 --> 1690.69
so

1718.17 --> 1723.3300000000002
no beat from the oh that's not true

1724.23 --> 1730.06
Holograms do not have a position they

1727.27 --> 1732.85
have an apparent position and depending

1730.06 --> 1738.8799999999999
on the nature of the hologram they can

1732.85 --> 1743.1699999999998
be visible or completely invisible the

1738.88 --> 1745.41
apparent image so that was completely

1743.17 --> 1745.41
wrong

1748.87 --> 1753.8899999999999
[Music]

1757.52 --> 1760.94
[Music]

1764.15 --> 1767.549
[Music]

1771.3 --> 1774.349
[Music]

1783.91 --> 1787.1190000000001
[Music]

1787.17 --> 1795.13
what okay Peter Finley one you don't get

1792.7 --> 1796.8400000000001
it or do you want you just want to test

1795.13 --> 1800.47
me if I can explain it correctly

1796.84 --> 1802.36
he asks explain how a hologram can show

1800.47 --> 1805.2
differently for different viewers

1802.36 --> 1809.56
well that's due to the nature of what

1805.2 --> 1815.02
puts the visual in place it's always

1809.56 --> 1817.06
reflection based somehow I think it has

1815.02 --> 1819.67
to do potentially with an interference

1817.06 --> 1822.61
pattern in the light the very mysterious

1819.67 --> 1825.91
even how it works but it is absolutely

1822.61 --> 1830.56
worked out and Holograms can be

1825.91 --> 1832.8300000000002
engineered even like on 2d with I think

1830.56 --> 1834.9099999999999
it's like crystals that are just

1832.83 --> 1838.62
reflecting in a specific way I don't

1834.91 --> 1842.65
know it's pretty amazing how it works I

1838.62 --> 1845.2299999999998
think I think it's been out there since

1842.65 --> 1847.27
the 60s or 70s something like that maybe

1845.23 --> 1849.19
earlier I don't know but it is

1847.27 --> 1851.74
definitely something more of the latter

1849.19 --> 1853.9
part of the 20th century when that

1851.74 --> 1855.4
started to when people could make that I

1853.9 --> 1859.39
remember it from the 80s

1855.4 --> 1861.88
like my first holographic satellites

1859.39 --> 1863.8300000000002
yeah really it was NASA stuff and

1861.88 --> 1866.0800000000002
satellites the first hologram pictures

1863.83 --> 1868.24
that I had when I was like six or

1866.08 --> 1870.4199999999998
something mate and I thought they were

1868.24 --> 1870.42
amazing

1873.24 --> 1883.2
but yeah it just it shows something

1877.419 --> 1883.2
depending on the angle of the viewer

1883.649 --> 1890.83
that's how it works so you could have a

1887.23 --> 1892.8700000000001
hologram on a flat surface the hologram

1890.83 --> 1894.549
effect look at it from one side seen one

1892.87 --> 1896.2589999999998
picture and somebody else could stand on

1894.549 --> 1897.97
the other side look it from another

1896.259 --> 1904.1390000000001
angle and see an entirely different

1897.97 --> 1910.84
picture that's also a hologram effect

1904.139 --> 1913.779
but it's 2d actual like the these

1910.84 --> 1915.6999999999998
high-tech Holograms like a flume wasn't

1913.779 --> 1917.889
too pakka now everything Michael Jackson

1915.7 --> 1920.3500000000001
I think - that's that's even more

1917.889 --> 1926.529
complicated I think that is like with

1920.35 --> 1929.519
beam interaction I don't know exactly

1926.529 --> 1931.12
how they did it it's a different type of

1929.519 --> 1934.72
approach

1931.12 --> 1934.7199999999998
[Music]

1935.39 --> 1940.89
all right you have a great day too

1937.5 --> 1946.53
casual spaceman I appreciate the

1940.89 --> 1957.3300000000002
questions and the civil that the civil

1946.53 --> 1960.6
attitude always good Major Tom that's

1957.33 --> 1962.58
kind of a strawman question but I don't

1960.6 --> 1965.4299999999998
know if the civil if the ancient

1962.58 --> 1969.6499999999999
civilization knew the Sun is a

1965.43 --> 1969.65
holographic projection it all depends on

1970.94 --> 1980.19
yeah if it if it even if it needed to be

1977.51 --> 1986.1
conceptualized that way or if it

1980.19 --> 1987.99
mattered to them if somebody were very

1986.1 --> 1989.9699999999998
very early on was gonna claim it was a

1987.99 --> 1993.51
literal physical thing out there like a

1989.97 --> 1994.98
ball then yeah even with the high tech

1993.51 --> 1997.11
empires they might have been inclined to

1994.98 --> 1999.93
also experiment like use their personal

1997.11 --> 2001.58
hovercrafts that try to approach the Sun

1999.93 --> 2003.5
and see what had happened and people

2001.58 --> 2005.84
would probably choke when I get up high

2003.5 --> 2008.24
enough or their devices my falter

2005.84 --> 2010.1
because I don't know it's probably

2008.24 --> 2012.29
electromagnetically driven and up there

2010.1 --> 2015.23
there's all kinds of stuff going so they

2012.29 --> 2018.5
would fail and then maybe somebody would

2015.23 --> 2021.8600000000001
suggest okay well we seem to our crew

2018.5 --> 2024.53
try to approach it but it just kept on

2021.86 --> 2026.4099999999999
bending away we couldn't it it didn't

2024.53 --> 2028.91
seem like we were getting closer and

2026.41 --> 2030.8000000000002
maybe we've ran into other problems like

2028.91 --> 2033.26
we couldn't breathe anymore devices

2030.8 --> 2035.09
failed so yeah it seems like we're

2033.26 --> 2038.54
trying to follow it but just it keeps on

2035.09 --> 2041.48
moving away so then they might conclude

2038.54 --> 2043.61
okay it may be like alive always moving

2041.48 --> 2046.04
away not really understanding nature of

2043.61 --> 2048.379
holographics or maybe they did then they

2046.04 --> 2049.73
were experts even in laser stuff so they

2048.379 --> 2051.83
already built that and then thought well

2049.73 --> 2055.46
maybe it is like the light natured

2051.83 --> 2058.04
somehow because yeah if you deal with

2055.46 --> 2060.889
lasers and really understands optics

2058.04 --> 2064.0099999999998
then yeah they'll protect the option of

2060.889 --> 2065.84
holographic becomes something just like

2064.01 --> 2067.86
with lenses you get to see lens flares

2065.84 --> 2070.86
and you know okay that's not literal

2067.86 --> 2072.92
a physical thing that's a light based

2070.86 --> 2075.42
phenomena it's like a hologram already

2072.92 --> 2079.11
so it depends on their understanding

2075.42 --> 2081.56
back in the day as how to they would

2079.11 --> 2084.7200000000003
approach the lights of the heaven and

2081.56 --> 2086.64
conceptualize it so they might have

2084.72 --> 2087.87
known it was all holographic somehow

2086.64 --> 2091.95
they might have even been able to

2087.87 --> 2094.95
interface with it or alter it I don't

2091.95 --> 2108.27
know it's a very very long time ago a

2094.95 --> 2110.85
lot has happened since then all right

2108.27 --> 2119.66
yeah I don't need your help thank you

2110.85 --> 2119.66
very much Thanks

2122.32 --> 2129.1600000000003
whoo check out the down votes yeah

2126.69 --> 2136.6
people really don't like it when I start

2129.16 --> 2142.75
to talk about holographic Sun and all

2136.6 --> 2144.73
that and well I'd I should meet troll

2142.75 --> 2146.2
baiting that just trying to distract I'm

2144.73 --> 2149.17
I'm doing great

2146.2 --> 2150.85
and I've got some really good questions

2149.17 --> 2152.38
from my audience I'm very happy about

2150.85 --> 2158.04
that so I'm just gonna kick all the

2152.38 --> 2161.52
trolls stay show their base behavior and

2158.04 --> 2161.52
get on with the show

2168.82 --> 2172.639
[Music]

2174.45 --> 2178.1699999999996
Kate where's Kay

2181.65 --> 2188.2200000000003
first are they listening with you Major

2184.53 --> 2192.84
Tom or gleam okay shout out to K

2188.22 --> 2193.3799999999997
wherever that is and hello Karen good to

2192.84 --> 2195.96
see you

2193.38 --> 2198.11
I need your wrench skills because

2195.96 --> 2202.11
there's some annoying trolls around

2198.11 --> 2203.51
don't just ban people out right because

2202.11 --> 2211.83
you really really hate them

2203.51 --> 2214.26
please hey hello hi fruit do you I

2211.83 --> 2216.59
haven't seen you in a long time good

2214.26 --> 2216.59
morning

2221.869 --> 2226.859
right well gently channel how does a

2224.729 --> 2228.93
hologram burn your skin well that's just

2226.859 --> 2230.729
it you know a hologram is light so if

2228.93 --> 2233.5789999999997
the nature of that light would be strong

2230.729 --> 2234.0589999999997
enough then technically just think about

2233.579 --> 2237.239
it

2234.059 --> 2240.029
it's basically light light being

2237.239 --> 2240.9
generated creating the super modern

2240.029 --> 2242.88
hologram

2240.9 --> 2246.839
I'll just imagine that those lights will

2242.88 --> 2252.509
not just be standard lamps for that but

2246.839 --> 2256.95
actually mega mega powerful potential

2252.509 --> 2259.2
laser strong beams well then if

2256.95 --> 2261.299
everything would be able to handle that

2259.2 --> 2263.9399999999996
kind of energy that would because of it

2261.299 --> 2267.5389999999998
then you could create a hologram as well

2263.94 --> 2272.759
but just seeing it would actually burn

2267.539 --> 2275.759
you right so yes a hologram can

2272.759 --> 2278.849
definitely it's still light radiating

2275.759 --> 2281.039
it's still that's why you see it so that

2278.849 --> 2285.9500000000003
light if strong enough can definitely

2281.039 --> 2285.9500000000003
have an effect on your skin absolutely

2289.26 --> 2300.2700000000004
yeah it's all light and light is

2292.14 --> 2302.16
absorbed and scattering I think much of

2300.27 --> 2305.19
the sunlight is basically so much

2302.16 --> 2309.1189999999997
scattered that in relation it doesn't

2305.19 --> 2311.16
even directly matter so much if you

2309.119 --> 2313.77
would be directly in the shadow if your

2311.16 --> 2318.33
skin would be absorbing Sun although for

2313.77 --> 2321.45
some reason not being in the shadow is

2318.33 --> 2325.71
major feelable dip yeah difference as in

2321.45 --> 2329.79
the heat part and that's tough to

2325.71 --> 2331.65
explain with the hologram supposedly

2329.79 --> 2334.56
being in a holographic position and

2331.65 --> 2336.09
somebody else sees it then that but on

2334.56 --> 2338.7599999999998
the other hand that's kind of weird like

2336.09 --> 2340.5
if you are in the Sun then it doesn't

2338.76 --> 2342.6000000000004
really even matter too much if your

2340.5 --> 2345.24
backside is in the shadow you are gonna

2342.6 --> 2347.0699999999997
be heating up entirely so you can't even

2345.24 --> 2352.6499999999996
say like oh it's because it's coming

2347.07 --> 2354.42
from this side no you are in a shadow so

2352.65 --> 2355.92
even if the Sun would be in a different

2354.42 --> 2358.98
position you would still be in a shell

2355.92 --> 2361.92
it's see it's kind of relative of that

2358.98 --> 2363.39
and I don't know I think it can kind of

2361.92 --> 2366.7200000000003
work technically but it's still

2363.39 --> 2368.7599999999998
mysterious to me so it's I'm really

2366.72 --> 2372.89
trying to dig through this holographic

2368.76 --> 2372.8900000000003
concept of the position of the Sun and

2372.92 --> 2377.359
building it because there's more

2378.9 --> 2385.54
you know the corpuscular A's were one of

2382.12 --> 2388.42
the first very strong signs of it that

2385.54 --> 2392.2
it is really holographic that you see

2388.42 --> 2395.14
these rays from the Sun through the

2392.2 --> 2397.6299999999997
clouds and then if somebody else miles

2395.14 --> 2400.12
and miles away would look at this Sun or

2397.63 --> 2401.8900000000003
exactly the same cloud formation that

2400.12 --> 2403.75
might be in a specific location through

2401.89 --> 2406.12
which the first observer sees those race

2403.75 --> 2408.07
they'd look at the landscape maybe even

2406.12 --> 2409.54
from a mountain down onto it so they

2408.07 --> 2412.21
could literally see the landscape and

2409.54 --> 2413.86
they would not see those race because

2412.21 --> 2416.11
the Sun to them is in a different

2413.86 --> 2419.31
position behind other potential clouds

2416.11 --> 2422.08
or not behind clouds at all yeah and

2419.31 --> 2425.0499999999997
that's been observed that's been tested

2422.08 --> 2431.2599999999998
I saw was it again Karen be somebody

2425.05 --> 2434.11
from the from the team you should know

2431.26 --> 2439.0200000000004
who it was was it again forget his name

2434.11 --> 2439.02
sorry he makes good videos

2439.24 --> 2442.35
[Music]

2446.57 --> 2455.56
was it again anybody even paying

2451.46 --> 2458.53
attention to what I'm saying serious but

2455.56 --> 2464.48
mm-hmm

2458.53 --> 2466.9100000000003
Zach it was sack yeah that's right he

2464.48 --> 2469.33
made he actually tested it out was

2466.91 --> 2469.33
awesome

2481.19 --> 2485.89
yeah decimal Z's called now Zack yep

2486.109 --> 2495.0589999999997
mid-city

2488.6 --> 2495.0589999999997
[Music]

2521.91 --> 2524.7799999999997
no one

2525.04 --> 2538.3
okay I'm losing track of our discussion

2528.46 --> 2540.4
here okay Theo Megawati says if the Sun

2538.3 --> 2543.9100000000003
was a hologram a light source wouldn't

2540.4 --> 2547.9900000000002
be shining on it in order to be shining

2543.91 --> 2550.0
on it would have to be physical object

2547.99 --> 2551.62
your assertion is coherent I don't

2550.0 --> 2556.84
understand what you're saying that

2551.62 --> 2559.81
doesn't make any sense to me that your

2556.84 --> 2563.44
assumption is that it is literally like

2559.81 --> 2565.54
a modern hologram device and that's not

2563.44 --> 2569.2000000000003
what I'm claiming I don't know the

2565.54 --> 2575.5
nature of its holographic apparition

2569.2 --> 2577.3599999999997
I just think strongly that it is

2575.5 --> 2579.79
holographic in nature and as I've

2577.36 --> 2584.05
explained there are multiple ways to

2579.79 --> 2588.55
create holographic effects so we may

2584.05 --> 2590.38
just simply not have figured it out but

2588.55 --> 2595.3300000000004
technically there might be some way to

2590.38 --> 2598.54
just somehow in the small scale emulate

2595.33 --> 2602.2599999999998
if you knew maybe it's like a dome in

2598.54 --> 2603.94
some way in a very simplistic way the

2602.26 --> 2607.32
entire globe of the heavens could be

2603.94 --> 2610.39
emulated somehow with technology without

2607.32 --> 2612.82
specifically filling in the details but

2610.39 --> 2615.1299999999997
just through a natural fractal it would

2612.82 --> 2617.2000000000003
automatically appear exactly like we see

2615.13 --> 2619.21
it including Sun and Moon and everything

2617.2 --> 2621.73
maybe maybe that is possible I don't

2619.21 --> 2624.88
know maybe it is like a totally natural

2621.73 --> 2628.2400000000002
effect for it to be exactly like we see

2624.88 --> 2633.51
it and might be miniaturized I don't

2628.24 --> 2633.5099999999998
know it's fascinating to find out

2646.329 --> 2660.9990000000003
okay I don't get that clean sorry yeah

2651.999 --> 2664.749
oh don't get cocky Jose it's not word

2660.999 --> 2668.049
salad it's just as much word salad as

2664.749 --> 2671.2189999999996
rumpus and all the ballers talk with

2668.049 --> 2673.929
their science fiction extrapolations

2671.219 --> 2676.329
they're detailed delving in their

2673.929 --> 2679.42
presuppositional universe it's on that

2676.329 --> 2686.049
level but this is just my thing this is

2679.42 --> 2687.939
where I'm exploring and I don't think

2686.049 --> 2690.429
it's worth salad because I'm not trying

2687.939 --> 2693.339
to confuse everyone I'm literally trying

2690.429 --> 2696.509
to explain concepts that are kind of

2693.339 --> 2696.509
difficult I realize that

2712.15 --> 2717.29
Karen B What did he say I told you not

2715.61 --> 2720.25
the time I had people just because you

2717.29 --> 2720.25
dislike him What did he say

2731.92 --> 2740.65
mm yeah yeah sure Brenda from arson

2752.82 --> 2761.76
okay okay sure gleam sure I don't

2755.76 --> 2765.6600000000003
exactly understand it but why are you

2761.76 --> 2775.3100000000004
talking click on the comment and read it

2765.66 --> 2777.54
how do I do that if it's a view did wait

2775.31 --> 2780.0499999999997
holy [ __ ] I didn't even know you could

2777.54 --> 2780.05
do that

2784.91 --> 2790.7
okay okay yeah I get it that's it's

2788.87 --> 2793.49
slander I get it

2790.7 --> 2795.9199999999996
sorry but it's good to know that you can

2793.49 --> 2798.9799999999996
actually do it I to be fair it always

2795.92 --> 2806.4500000000003
does say that and I just never saw it

2798.98 --> 2809.21
that's so weird I just naturally took it

2806.45 --> 2811.37
as computer spam I guess I have that

2809.21 --> 2813.59
sometimes I just don't pick up on

2811.37 --> 2816.68
certain things that are just generally

2813.59 --> 2818.6000000000004
present extra text because computers has

2816.68 --> 2820.79
so much text everywhere and it just

2818.6 --> 2824.5699999999997
sometimes overlooked things that's weird

2820.79 --> 2825.83
anyway good to know that's funny

2824.57 --> 2828.13
let's see if I can do that with more

2825.83 --> 2828.13
things

2836.11 --> 2843.4900000000002
alright okay I get it yeah coach oh okay

2841.12 --> 2848.2
if you're gonna be here in my chat Kosho

2843.49 --> 2851.89
and karen is here then stop stop

2848.2 --> 2856.4399999999996
addressing her stop harassing her

2851.89 --> 2856.44
basically that's so I get it

2856.84 --> 2860.0190000000002
[Music]

2868.0 --> 2870.57
at

2873.95 --> 2876.79
right

2877.04 --> 2888.57
Fusion is own way Fusion is the other

2881.78 --> 2890.9300000000003
okay Randa sure that makes a lot of

2888.57 --> 2890.9300000000003
sense

2913.569 --> 2919.179
maybe Brenda needs some coffee to wake

2915.969 --> 2941.319
up first because she's not really

2919.179 --> 2946.2290000000003
picking up on what she's typing okie

2941.319 --> 2946.229
dokie Brenda I thought so

2955.34 --> 2961.9700000000003
all right I don't know about fusion

2959.03 --> 2964.48
Ephesian though I think it's highly

2961.97 --> 2964.48
theoretical

2976.94 --> 2985.19
although yeah I have heard stories mind

2980.78 --> 2990.11
use pure stories about is it fusion

2985.19 --> 2991.9700000000003
reactors that ever were in being built

2990.11 --> 2995.56
and that was even like ten years ago

2991.97 --> 2995.56
when I first saw those stories

2999.97 --> 3006.27
well that's very nice Brenda but the

3003.54 --> 3012.09
thing is about nuclear reactors could

3006.27 --> 3014.67
actually be something else in the sense

3012.09 --> 3017.4300000000003
that the the materials that they say

3014.67 --> 3020.16
they use are being used but they just

3017.43 --> 3022.8799999999997
don't exactly work the way they say it

3020.16 --> 3026.0699999999997
is supposed to work it works differently

3022.88 --> 3035.28
so it's like secret application of

3026.07 --> 3038.13
things with a cover story but I am I I'm

3035.28 --> 3041.1000000000004
not a nuclear expert or even nuclear

3038.13 --> 3043.7400000000002
conspiracy cover story expert I just

3041.1 --> 3045.27
know that there's different angles to it

3043.74 --> 3049.2299999999996
and sometimes here are people about it

3045.27 --> 3052.25
and I find it very fascinating what they

3049.23 --> 3052.25
theorize about it

3056.0 --> 3065.18
all right Daniel field what maybe maybe

3059.57 --> 3072.26
it is nuclear fusion is a giant fraud I

3065.18 --> 3076.0699999999997
don't know if it is I think nuclear

3072.26 --> 3079.0
fission probably is a giant fraud but

3076.07 --> 3082.04
fusion the new application of basically

3079.0 --> 3086.57
creating a miniature Sun as they try to

3082.04 --> 3090.0099999999998
suggest it somehow with hydrogen maybe

3086.57 --> 3090.01
that is possible

3095.35 --> 3101.14
and as for nuclear reactors maybe it

3099.01 --> 3105.5200000000004
just doesn't exactly work like they say

3101.14 --> 3108.49
it does but it kind of does and it does

3105.52 --> 3111.64
actually create well it heats water the

3108.49 --> 3113.4399999999996
hotter the water hot water drives the

3111.64 --> 3114.97
turbine the turbine mate makes

3113.44 --> 3117.73
electricity that's what it does it's a

3114.97 --> 3120.43
it's a natural water heater and I think

3117.73 --> 3123.43
it does do that I do believe in the

3120.43 --> 3128.56
existence of uranium that has special

3123.43 --> 3137.1099999999997
properties but what are the real effects

3128.56 --> 3140.5
and radiation there there is something

3137.11 --> 3143.98
like radiation definitely but I don't

3140.5 --> 3146.11
know I don't know enough about it I know

3143.98 --> 3150.16
what it's supposed to be officially

3146.11 --> 3153.34
though I have learned about the alpha

3150.16 --> 3156.19
beta gamma radiation and all that how

3153.34 --> 3160.0
I've had that in school so I know it but

3156.19 --> 3165.52
I have some doubts about it not like

3160.0 --> 3167.83
super big doubts at all and those doubts

3165.52 --> 3170.53
definitely do not reach into chemistry

3167.83 --> 3173.56
mind you I have a solid trust in general

3170.53 --> 3177.07
chemistry that that really is exactly

3173.56 --> 3178.54
how it says it functions although maybe

3177.07 --> 3180.67
certain properties might have been

3178.54 --> 3182.98
hidden from people might probably

3180.67 --> 3189.04
industrial secrets all that but

3182.98 --> 3191.1
chemistry is it works but as for nuclear

3189.04 --> 3193.5099999999998
technology I have doubts about that

3191.1 --> 3195.94
about nuclear reactors that they would

3193.51 --> 3199.7200000000003
work exactly as the science supposedly

3195.94 --> 3204.82
tells us and especially about nuclear

3199.72 --> 3208.0
bombs and I really really hope that I'm

3204.82 --> 3208.6600000000003
mistaken about nuclear bombs at that but

3208.0 --> 3213.31
I don't know

3208.66 --> 3217.33
I don't can't say for sure but I in the

3213.31 --> 3221.2
nuclear region the bomb is probably the

3217.33 --> 3223.0
biggest doubter for me but it's not like

3221.2 --> 3224.0499999999997
oh yeah of course they don't exist I'm

3223.0 --> 3227.17
not like

3224.05 --> 3229.1800000000003
that that much in doubt about it I think

3227.17 --> 3233.98
there is a chance that it might be real

3229.18 --> 3236.29
or that they kind of that they tricked

3233.98 --> 3238.33
it first to dramatize it to influence

3236.29 --> 3242.38
everyone to get momentum and that there

3238.33 --> 3246.94
may actually be something like that but

3242.38 --> 3248.6800000000003
that it existed later maybe something

3246.94 --> 3251.9700000000003
like I don't know I hope it doesn't

3248.68 --> 3256.2999999999997
exist and who knows maybe there are just

3251.97 --> 3258.4599999999996
super giant bombs and they might appear

3256.3 --> 3261.52
almost like nuclear if they would be

3258.46 --> 3264.76
used but they might not even be nuclear

3261.52 --> 3266.74
they might just get that again how that

3264.76 --> 3268.6600000000003
actually works maybe a cover story and

3266.74 --> 3275.74
they found a different process to create

3268.66 --> 3278.1099999999997
a giant explosion I don't know there's

3275.74 --> 3284.7099999999996
like a century of development here you

3278.11 --> 3286.6800000000003
know no no I'm not a nuclear physicist

3284.71 --> 3290.23
Samus

3286.68 --> 3292.1499999999996
I'm just approaching it from a pretty

3290.23 --> 3296.02
colloquial angle with some understanding

3292.15 --> 3299.11
a little because I did have physics in

3296.02 --> 3301.3
school and did pretty well there and I

3299.11 --> 3304.9500000000003
do remember the rough lines of how it

3301.3 --> 3309.25
works how it's supposed to be working

3304.95 --> 3312.18
and yeah I just have my doubts with

3309.25 --> 3312.18
certain details

3319.09 --> 3322.2000000000003
what the hell

3327.47 --> 3331.299
what kind of a question is that

3348.17 --> 3353.2400000000002
okay

3350.55 --> 3353.2400000000002
dude

3353.41 --> 3362.609
just go away seriously I'm sick of this

3357.46 --> 3362.609
[ __ ] stop trolling my [ __ ] please

3375.17 --> 3378.2690000000002
[Music]

3387.49 --> 3396.18
I had a very very weird sketchy in my

3390.609 --> 3399.0099999999998
mind kind of like a parody of a parody

3396.18 --> 3400.75
yeah I'll think I'll share it especially

3399.01 --> 3403.69
like in the last part where nobody

3400.75 --> 3408.609
watches that I'm just kidding maybe they

3403.69 --> 3411.7000000000003
will know it's kind of a comedy joke and

3408.609 --> 3413.5299999999997
it's it references life of Ryan so it

3411.7 --> 3415.21
could probably be done but I'll just

3413.53 --> 3420.21
explain it it's a scene that's very

3415.21 --> 3420.21
familiar with a lot of people it's when

3420.9 --> 3427.9300000000003
the what is it the Judean people's front

3424.21 --> 3430.45
are in the blind man's cabin basically

3427.93 --> 3432.5499999999997
talk conspiring as they are always doing

3430.45 --> 3434.2
against the Romans and then the Romans

3432.55 --> 3436.96
come knocking on the door and the blind

3434.2 --> 3440.3999999999996
old man basically does kind of a routine

3436.96 --> 3443.099
talk and yeah they're searching

3440.4 --> 3447.9100000000003
everything but everyone's like hidden

3443.099 --> 3449.559
ridiculously obvious and then the Romans

3447.91 --> 3452.069
go in and they don't find anyone and

3449.559 --> 3454.75
they got out then it happens again

3452.069 --> 3456.79
really really quickly it's very comedic

3454.75 --> 3460.049
oh and then they come out and I say we

3456.79 --> 3463.42
found this spoon sir so I was thinking

3460.049 --> 3465.069
it's probably it's probably not gonna be

3463.42 --> 3469.4500000000003
as funny as the original I really like

3465.069 --> 3472.089
that sketch but I was thinking you could

3469.45 --> 3474.27
politicize it and just say that the

3472.089 --> 3478.66
Romans came in and they're looking for

3474.27 --> 3482.589
for Russian collusion and it barred you

3478.66 --> 3487.5099999999998
in the house so no we didn't found any

3482.589 --> 3491.5299999999997
Russian sir just a bunch of Jews okay

3487.51 --> 3497.559
then they go back like I think we missed

3491.53 --> 3501.88
a spot and they go in again and the same

3497.559 --> 3504.88
thing it see suddenly suddenly it makes

3501.88 --> 3507.03
sense okay that was probably very stupid

3504.88 --> 3507.03
you

3511.97 --> 3515.27
[Music]

3516.16 --> 3520.33
but it would be kind of ironic you know

3523.06 --> 3528.67
yeah maybe you could make it

3525.56 --> 3532.97
the old man Trump opening the door

3528.67 --> 3540.67
looking for a Russian collusion nope we

3532.97 --> 3540.6699999999996
just found a bunch of juicer ok get it

3545.17 --> 3550.67
we have Alex Jones's crew could totally

3548.72 --> 3569.12
do sketch like this but they would never

3550.67 --> 3572.41
do it of course I hope you guys

3569.12 --> 3572.41
appreciate the joke

3573.69 --> 3576.9
[Music]

3580.9 --> 3585.079
right Crowder

3582.95 --> 3591.47
but Crowder doesn't really make jokes

3585.079 --> 3594.049
about Jews right or maybe this is just

3591.47 --> 3597.589
about doable well he has my full

3594.049 --> 3600.17
permission to basically take my idea it

3597.589 --> 3601.91
would be an honor if he'd actually dare

3600.17 --> 3604.609
to mention my name probably wouldn't

3601.91 --> 3606.3489999999997
what that would be kind of cool since I

3604.609 --> 3608.45
did kind of make up the idea about

3606.349 --> 3611.44
anyone's welcome to basically try that

3608.45 --> 3615.2599999999998
out take that life famous life of ryan

3611.44 --> 3618.14
comedy sketch and voice it over and

3615.26 --> 3620.9
maybe stick like a head on over the

3618.14 --> 3624.2889999999998
blind man of trump and you could

3620.9 --> 3628.25
potentially even make the romans like

3624.289 --> 3630.26
the democrats put like nancy pelosi over

3628.25 --> 3632.529
it or something like that it's very

3630.26 --> 3632.529
doable

3635.44 --> 3639.309
I think they would appreciate something

3637.329 --> 3643.329
like that at this point it's very much

3639.309 --> 3651.51
up there political joking alley and it's

3643.329 --> 3655.8390000000004
very straight to the points we'll see

3651.51 --> 3658.17
who gets there first but you heard it

3655.839 --> 3666.7
first on the early bird show guys

3658.17 --> 3668.7400000000002
number one number 175 so yeah I'm gonna

3666.7 --> 3673.0
round out to show it's been an hour

3668.74 --> 3675.7
exactly and yeah I've been talking

3673.0 --> 3683.44
plenty I didn't really feel like guests

3675.7 --> 3685.23
anyway I think yeah oh hold on oh oh

3683.44 --> 3690.4
damn

3685.23 --> 3693.369
whoops I yeah I didn't see that

3690.4 --> 3699.609
Reilly actually asked for a link but I

3693.369 --> 3701.7000000000003
completely didn't see the message that

3699.609 --> 3704.68
would have been good if to have him um I

3701.7 --> 3706.4199999999996
don't know if he's still there but now

3704.68 --> 3708.7889999999998
I'm gonna round out the show I kind of

3706.42 --> 3711.16
need to have a break and the debate

3708.789 --> 3716.23
should be starting any moment now

3711.16 --> 3718.24
so thanks everyone for coming I hope you

3716.23 --> 3722.109
like the show please upload it if you

3718.24 --> 3725.14
did and yeah subscribe to my channel hit

3722.109 --> 3726.94
the bell notification to know when I'm

3725.14 --> 3731.799
going life which should be 2 p.m.

3726.94 --> 3733.9
Amsterdam time every day and yeah please

interesting even then it already has

3750.19 --> 3757.2000000000003
because it's me and I'm so interesting

3753.39 --> 3757.2
maybe I don't know

3758.23 --> 3766.58
shut up right now right so I will be

3765.26 --> 3770.78

next time hashtag me for of course and

3773.27 --> 3808.0389999999998
keep it flat
