so yeah starting a little late again

166.81 --> 173.16
[Music]

169.8 --> 175.44
oh well weather today is

173.16 --> 178.34
kind of the same as yesterday maybe a

175.44 --> 178.34
little less clouded

179.519 --> 185.09900000000002
it's not raining out of these clouds

181.98 --> 187.73899999999998
they don't seem to be thick enough

185.099 --> 190.94
I mean I've seen us a few droplets here

187.739 --> 190.94
and there but not really

191.04 --> 197.519
anything noteworthy

194.28 --> 199.8
right and there's a much much less wind

197.519 --> 202.14000000000001
that does really stand out

199.8 --> 204.44
even up there it's kind of just hanging

202.14 --> 204.44
still

208.2 --> 214.28
right

210.18 --> 214.28
okay camera freeze wow

216.48 --> 220.56
uh

218.159 --> 222.29899999999998
low Matthew Hall first in chat Mike

220.56 --> 224.34
zadunich

222.299 --> 230.64000000000001
good to see you all

224.34 --> 230.64000000000001
it is Monday the 30th of May 2022

238.379 --> 240.98
right

247.68 --> 252.239
been out for groceries twice already

249.659 --> 255.42
today one was really early to get

252.239 --> 257.04
groceries second was to get smokes which

255.42 --> 258.9
is part of the reason why I was late

257.04 --> 261.199
because that shop only opens after one

258.9 --> 261.19899999999996
o'clock

261.54 --> 265.62
yeah

263.759 --> 268.91900000000004
but it was really good to like have a

265.62 --> 271.259
bike ride out there did close up pretty

268.919 --> 274.139
much but just a lot of fresh air that

271.259 --> 278.41900000000004
did me a lot of good I also had a bit of

274.139 --> 278.419
a new experiment a little drinksy

278.52 --> 282.78
but remember those little bottles with

280.74 --> 285.54
uh

282.78 --> 288.05999999999995
I said again turmeric ginger and

285.54 --> 290.34000000000003
Chili Pepper well there's a there was

288.06 --> 291.96
another for for Ryan that I noticed I

290.34 --> 293.52
don't know how long it's been there I've

291.96 --> 296.75899999999996
been asking

293.52 --> 298.85999999999996
like big title garana

296.759 --> 302.40000000000003
or go around that

298.86 --> 306.91900000000004
and I thought like hmm

302.4 --> 309.06
I want to try that it turns out only 0.4

306.919 --> 311.28
guaranai in there

309.06 --> 314.46
I had to like get a magnifying glass to

311.28 --> 316.73999999999995
even read that such a small letters

314.46 --> 318.96
but yeah

316.74 --> 321.44
that did feel kind of good

318.96 --> 324.5
I got another bottle

321.44 --> 324.5
yeah yeah

327.6 --> 332.28000000000003
it's funny because I've been hearing

329.58 --> 334.02
actually through Infowars advertisement

332.28 --> 335.63899999999995
about it

334.02 --> 338.24
so it's something that they're doing

335.639 --> 338.24
stuff with

338.82 --> 343.86
which usually means there's something to

340.919 --> 345.65999999999997
it so if it is just available here now

343.86 --> 349.139
that's interesting so I thought I'd try

345.66 --> 351.41900000000004
it I did not super like the taste

349.139 --> 353.22
but it feels kind of good

351.419 --> 356.65999999999997
kind of a

353.22 --> 356.66
fresh uplifting feeling

357.72 --> 360.38000000000005
anyway

364.8 --> 370.44
oh yeah and

367.4 --> 372.78
synchronicities okay I do have them all

370.44 --> 375.71999999999997
the time I barely talk about it like I

372.78 --> 378.96
just like to kind of let it dream

375.72 --> 381.41900000000004
but one was just really funny now

378.96 --> 385.38
it's very kind of personal

381.419 --> 388.19899999999996
so I'll have to like explain it

385.38 --> 390.479
remember when I first like started

388.199 --> 392.16
talking about blueberry and I mean I've

390.479 --> 394.5
like really

392.16 --> 396.47900000000004
been repeating it because I do really

394.5 --> 398.699
think this is important

396.479 --> 401.88
but when I first started talking about

398.699 --> 405.06
it was like oh yeah it's very different

401.88 --> 406.08
it's not freaking Tombstone so just get

405.06 --> 408.84
over it

406.08 --> 411.599
it's not Tombstone it's a different move

408.84 --> 416.539
well when I first started saying that

411.599 --> 416.539
now only I just noticed browsing through

416.58 --> 423.479
Eternal awesome I guess sort of a sort

420.12 --> 427.62
of liberal very theatrical people

423.479 --> 430.25899999999996
movie and series and things reviewers

427.62 --> 432.599
and they're kind of

430.259 --> 434.40000000000003
they're trying to aim at a more general

432.599 --> 436.259
public now

434.4 --> 439.62
but still they give a lot of personal

436.259 --> 441.84000000000003
input and insight and I like they are

439.62 --> 444.479
kind of liberal but I do like them

441.84 --> 446.69899999999996
you'll think that

444.479 --> 451.56
they're at least sensible about things

446.699 --> 454.979
and their their arguments but guess what

451.56 --> 456.12
like the main guy there reviewed on that

454.979 --> 458.28
very day

456.12 --> 459.72
tombstones

458.28 --> 462.55999999999995
dude

459.72 --> 462.56
the [ __ ]

462.78 --> 469.25899999999996
and it was a pretty good review

466.319 --> 472.099
but it's just like bumping into that

469.259 --> 472.099
it's like what

474.72 --> 480.36
really and it's not like it was in the

477.84 --> 481.919
theme of like building up to something

480.36 --> 483.96000000000004
right because they do that they'd be

481.919 --> 486.06
like oh there's a new Batman movie let's

483.96 --> 488.63899999999995
review all the Batman move no this is

486.06 --> 490.86
just like Tombstone back just there was

488.639 --> 493.40000000000003
no Western stuff around that or anything

490.86 --> 497.40000000000003
it's just like Bang

493.4 --> 497.4
hmm hmm

498.66 --> 504.47900000000004
somebody from ciao awesome tuning into

502.319 --> 507.139
the early bird show

504.479 --> 507.139
I wonder

507.66 --> 512.219
if they did I'd feel honored because

509.759 --> 514.2
yeah I've been following them for a very

512.219 --> 516.719
long time

514.2 --> 519.659
through all kinds of ups and downs

516.719 --> 521.88
and they can always like

519.659 --> 525.18
open

521.88 --> 527.82
like there's not really

525.18 --> 529.3199999999999
okay there's yeah

527.82 --> 532.08
of course there's always a Grappler

529.32 --> 534.86
somewhere but overall like they're

532.08 --> 534.86
pretty good people

535.56 --> 539.4899999999999
anyway

537.0 --> 542.519
ah

539.49 --> 544.92
[Music]

542.519 --> 547.44
at least I hope they are

544.92 --> 549.24
they do like to like they are very

547.44 --> 552.98
liberal so they are like oh I like

549.24 --> 552.98
spooky and dark [ __ ] and

553.38 --> 556.16
that too

557.16 --> 564.959
so they're not like

560.519 --> 566.64
you're us or anything no anyway uh I

564.959 --> 570.4399999999999
just thought it was funny bumping into

566.64 --> 570.4399999999999
that and just realizing like what

571.86 --> 576.839
now technically

574.14 --> 579.18
and this is this gets weird because I

576.839 --> 581.0400000000001
just start thinking about like how how

579.18 --> 583.7399999999999
did that happen

581.04 --> 586.8
right I don't believe in coincidences I

583.74 --> 589.58
believe in a mechanical structure

586.8 --> 589.5799999999999
so

595.08 --> 600.839
how did I come up in that moment

597.26 --> 604.26
comparing it to tombstone

600.839 --> 606.36
I didn't like I don't follow any of

604.26 --> 608.519
these guys's boards because they have

606.36 --> 611.4590000000001
like forums and

608.519 --> 613.86
they do polls a lot right that's how

611.459 --> 616.64
they kind of like well become more

613.86 --> 616.64
mainstream too

617.519 --> 620.7
right

618.54 --> 622.1999999999999
so they probably had it on the list

620.7 --> 623.88
somewhere and everybody voted for

622.2 --> 626.0400000000001
tombstone

623.88 --> 628.62
but it's just kind of weird

626.04 --> 631.5
so it's more likely they've already made

628.62 --> 633.24
that video by that time but how then out

631.5 --> 636.72
of nowhere not knowing anything about

633.24 --> 639.0
what was coming would I say tombstone

636.72 --> 641.82
I don't know

639.0 --> 643.62
it's just very synchronistic

641.82 --> 646.74
and weird

643.62 --> 650.899
and like in a way I am putting too much

646.74 --> 650.899
weight on myself here it's just that

650.94 --> 657.72
like I I'm not potentially not even that

654.18 --> 661.64
significant but it does feel like I am

657.72 --> 661.64
and I know that I get things right

662.339 --> 667.5600000000001
right maybe little detail mistakes but

665.279 --> 669.42
the overall structures I get it right

667.56 --> 673.459
and I grabbed deep

669.42 --> 673.459
so it's just yeah anyway

673.5 --> 676.16
uh

690.36 --> 696.26
okay interesting Matthew Hall

693.72 --> 696.26
see

696.38 --> 704.16
vitamin powder

699.779 --> 706.32
hemp calcium right well the nothing

704.16 --> 708.0
about that sounds bad

706.32 --> 711.74
although yeah what kind of vitamin

708.0 --> 711.74
powder of course but

711.779 --> 719.1
I mean I use algae I use like the

716.579 --> 721.1389999999999
supplement which is like a capsule

719.1 --> 723.899
it's almost like facial but it's not

721.139 --> 726.62
fish oil it's like an algae extract

723.899 --> 726.62
called again

729.92 --> 733.76
oh let me get it

772.74 --> 777.54
my memory works so funny when I

775.5 --> 780.899
approached my fridge

777.54 --> 782.399
like within two meters

780.899 --> 784.86
it's like

782.399 --> 786.0
instantly I could remember what his name

784.86 --> 789.24
was

786.0 --> 793.44
but it was like palpable when

789.24 --> 796.8
like it was somehow a approximation to

793.44 --> 798.839
it suddenly reminded me it's very

796.8 --> 802.68
being me is weird

798.839 --> 804.3000000000001
anyway it's called astaxantine

802.68 --> 807.3
right

804.3 --> 809.6999999999999
and it is effectively an LG abstract

807.3 --> 811.68
also by the way use spirulina of course

809.7 --> 815.3000000000001
oh yeah and this is

811.68 --> 815.3
bottle I was talking about

821.93 --> 825.959
[Music]

824.1 --> 830.9590000000001
right

825.959 --> 830.959
it also looks kind of dirty but

831.3 --> 835.9989999999999
feels good

832.86 --> 835.999
[Music]

840.839 --> 845.6
I had it like

842.82 --> 845.6
see

847.019 --> 851.519
one and a half hour ago

849.0 --> 855.019
[Music]

851.519 --> 855.019
right so anyway

861.66 --> 867.199
hope you guys been up to let me check

864.36 --> 867.1990000000001
what was that doing

872.579 --> 877.3389999999999
oh yeah Quantum of conscience had

874.56 --> 877.3389999999999
another good video

881.339 --> 886.019
not as good as the one before that but

883.44 --> 888.8000000000001
pretty good did everybody check out the

886.019 --> 888.8
one that I Linked UP

891.42 --> 895.4399999999999
like I really like the whole Spectrum

893.699 --> 897.899
talk

895.44 --> 899.94
like it's so clear

897.899 --> 904.88
so usable

899.94 --> 904.8800000000001
all I have to do is remember it uh

905.93 --> 909.959
[Music]

907.86 --> 912.1800000000001
had a really good idea but I'd like have

909.959 --> 915.4799999999999
to literally watch his video back to

912.18 --> 918.3599999999999
like reconstruct it

915.48 --> 921.54
because he does inspire some really

918.36 --> 924.1990000000001
heavy esoterics

921.54 --> 924.199
huh

934.139 --> 940.0790000000001
okay Matthew Hall that's weird

937.62 --> 942.3
Tombstone yeah look there's a whole

940.079 --> 945.0
bunch of stuff about that movie The

942.3 --> 947.2199999999999
Making of it the history that it's based

945.0 --> 949.32
on the real story sort of

947.22 --> 952.6800000000001
right

949.32 --> 955.8000000000001
but yeah like I mean

952.68 --> 958.56
blueberry obviously is complete fiction

955.8 --> 963.7199999999999
like there's nothing real about any

958.56 --> 967.68
locations or Figures it's fear fiction

963.72 --> 969.12
but it's just not overly concerned with

967.68 --> 971.0999999999999
that

969.12 --> 974.579
is just trying to

971.1 --> 978.72
share an experience and some really deep

974.579 --> 980.459
insights very clearly without clutter

978.72 --> 983.519
this is just a completely different

980.459 --> 986.779
movie effectively effectively anyway I'm

983.519 --> 986.779
gonna put these back in the fridge

1023.18 --> 1025.839
foreign

1033.459 --> 1039.819
of things as they were created cast into

1036.439 --> 1039.8190000000002
out into existence

1039.919 --> 1046.039
well yeah Matthew Hall

1043.22 --> 1047.6000000000001
it's what I suspect as to the origin of

1046.039 --> 1049.58
the synchronicity if that's what you're

1047.6 --> 1052.1
talking about

1049.58 --> 1054.32
right because

1052.1 --> 1057.02
I am an empath

1054.32 --> 1060.02
and when I care about something I kind

1057.02 --> 1062.12
of tune into them and into just more

1060.02 --> 1064.76
than like the picture they have to

1062.12 --> 1067.3999999999999
represent it's like

1064.76 --> 1069.98
you could compare it to

1067.4 --> 1072.3200000000002
there's like a puppet show and like I'm

1069.98 --> 1075.2
into the puppet shows

1072.32 --> 1077.8999999999999
right think about like way like 200

1075.2 --> 1079.5800000000002
years ago or more to the puppet shows

1077.9 --> 1080.48
Well everybody's like oh that's a fun

1079.58 --> 1082.1599999999999
story

1080.48 --> 1084.26
but I'm like

1082.16 --> 1086.0
how did they come up with the story who

1084.26 --> 1089.96
who is that

1086.0 --> 1092.36
who are those actors and like why did

1089.96 --> 1095.419
the character they were playing in that

1092.36 --> 1097.28
day sound a little bit different could

1095.419 --> 1099.2
it be because they had like a personal

1097.28 --> 1100.52
thing that was kind of burdening them or

1099.2 --> 1102.32
they were distracted or they were

1100.52 --> 1103.94
secretly having an argument

1102.32 --> 1105.9189999999999
with the cast

1103.94 --> 1110.6000000000001
and they had to just straight face it

1105.919 --> 1113.0590000000002
like that's what I then do and then I

1110.6 --> 1115.9399999999998
just learn so much more from just

1113.059 --> 1120.34
looking at that Puppet Theater

1115.94 --> 1120.3400000000001
and this is kind of what happens to me

1120.559 --> 1123.76
I hope that makes sense

1124.039 --> 1130.179
so it's just I Zone in and I just pick

1126.62 --> 1130.1789999999999
up on things they think

1131.78 --> 1137.539
like what they're actually doing in that

1134.059 --> 1139.94
moment and I'm not like wanting to grab

1137.539 --> 1142.1
it and like literally get the thoughts

1139.94 --> 1144.38
it's just I touch it

1142.1 --> 1146.9189999999999
and then it becomes a part of my

1144.38 --> 1146.919
structure

1147.38 --> 1152.24
and then it influences the way I think I

1150.799 --> 1156.28
have ideas

1152.24 --> 1156.28
it's that's what I suspect

1156.5 --> 1164.32
right it's not literally telepathic it

1159.799 --> 1164.32
is effectively telepathic is

1164.919 --> 1168.7
reminiscent at times

1168.799 --> 1171.4
anyway

1171.44 --> 1175.94
because I just always

1173.44 --> 1177.919
naturally embrace all the deeper

1175.94 --> 1180.0800000000002
structures that is like the full

1177.919 --> 1181.5800000000002
information of a complete person and

1180.08 --> 1183.4399999999998
their struggles and the things that

1181.58 --> 1185.26
nobody and they themselves don't want to

1183.44 --> 1188.96
know about

1185.26 --> 1192.74
I just kind of do that

1188.96 --> 1195.58
so then I just see much more and what's

1192.74 --> 1195.58
actually going on

1196.64 --> 1199.1200000000001
anyway

1201.62 --> 1206.32
I hope anybody is following what I'm

1203.84 --> 1206.32
talking about

1210.14 --> 1215.0
free voices HD takes good internet to

1213.679 --> 1217.2800000000002
stream

1215.0 --> 1219.559
HD

1217.28 --> 1222.559
well

1219.559 --> 1225.3799999999999
George Sanford you can just like have

1222.559 --> 1228.76
lower resolution options I mean it's

1225.38 --> 1228.7600000000002
mostly just voice anyway

1244.89 --> 1248.0590000000002
[Music]

1249.74 --> 1253.48
not a free voice no options really

1257.72 --> 1259.9
foreign

1270.08 --> 1274.6399999999999
that's odd

1272.78 --> 1276.98
I mean if you're gonna do it in higher

1274.64 --> 1279.5590000000002
resolution then why not lower that takes

1276.98 --> 1281.84
up so much less

1279.559 --> 1285.46
anyways

1281.84 --> 1285.4599999999998
maybe he'll be working on that

1286.76 --> 1291.52
but I don't know why it doesn't just

1288.559 --> 1291.52
have like a podcast

1291.74 --> 1296.179
dual system for it

1294.02 --> 1299.32
but whatever

1296.179 --> 1299.3200000000002
at least it's there

1312.53 --> 1315.76
[Music]

1323.0 --> 1326.659
all right anyway

1330.44 --> 1333.44
this

1352.58 --> 1356.9189999999999
and by the way hello moon buggy

1361.64 --> 1364.1200000000001
yeah

1364.46 --> 1366.76
foreign

1370.66 --> 1376.64
[Music]

1404.02 --> 1409.28
also talking about synchronicities a

1407.299 --> 1412.28
little bit more on a complex level

1409.28 --> 1414.98
less tangible even sometimes when I

1412.28 --> 1417.76
watch own Benjamin just because of the

1414.98 --> 1417.76
way he is

1418.4 --> 1424.3400000000001
and because of the way I am

1421.34 --> 1426.62
it feels sometimes like he says

1424.34 --> 1428.12
something that it feels like I'm saying

1426.62 --> 1430.4599999999998
that

1428.12 --> 1432.02
it's really weird

1430.46 --> 1434.419
this

1432.02 --> 1437.26
and like the only difference is is just

1434.419 --> 1437.26
like his style

1441.2 --> 1445.64
and well what he dwells upon like the

1444.14 --> 1446.96
choices that he makes within the train

1445.64 --> 1449.8400000000001
of thinking

1446.96 --> 1451.3400000000001
it is different but it just feels so

1449.84 --> 1454.1
much alike

1451.34 --> 1454.9399999999998
in ways and I sound very different by

1454.1 --> 1457.039
the way

1454.94 --> 1459.52
very different from Owen I'm nothing

1457.039 --> 1459.52
like him

1474.7 --> 1480.0800000000002
but he does like think on a very high

1477.5 --> 1483.679
level and

1480.08 --> 1485.6
maybe he's not even able to explain what

1483.679 --> 1489.039
he experiences all that well

1485.6 --> 1489.039
but it is detectable

1492.98 --> 1499.46
I hope it is with me as well it should

1495.559 --> 1501.03
be crazy at this point if it wasn't

1499.46 --> 1504.23
uh

1501.03 --> 1504.23
[Music]

1518.779 --> 1522.76
hey at least G let's see you

1523.039 --> 1525.22
foreign

1530.72 --> 1534.849
what's up

1531.79 --> 1534.849
[Music]

1553.039 --> 1556.179
ah all right

1556.58 --> 1558.6999999999998
thank you

1559.4 --> 1562.8400000000001
okay let's see

1577.7 --> 1582.64
you know what I find the weirdest about

1579.62 --> 1582.6399999999999
my own streams

1583.52 --> 1589.76
that I find certain

1587.0 --> 1593.6
segments that I talk about when I kind

1589.76 --> 1596.779
of get nerdy or it feels like that to me

1593.6 --> 1599.0
but that's actually one way to myself

1596.779 --> 1602.0
Looking Back review like the most

1599.0 --> 1602.0
information

1602.24 --> 1606.919
it's so odd watching myself back

1603.98 --> 1608.72
sometimes and I really wonder if

1606.919 --> 1612.2
everybody like

1608.72 --> 1617.38
picks up on the same things or just com

1612.2 --> 1617.38
like how wide a spectrum is my output

1618.98 --> 1623.419
I'm not even sure like the percentages

1621.44 --> 1626.0
of how much you guys

1623.419 --> 1628.8400000000001
like really understand of everything

1626.0 --> 1628.84
that I talk about

1629.679 --> 1635.48
also because of well the esoterics of it

1632.96 --> 1636.8600000000001
like I mean it is all

1635.48 --> 1639.38
very

1636.86 --> 1642.26
spiritual describing things that are

1639.38 --> 1644.6000000000001
intangible that are very like perception

1642.26 --> 1647.299
based including of what your mind tends

1644.6 --> 1648.98
to make of things and Etc it's very

1647.299 --> 1653.24
difficult to explain

1648.98 --> 1657.22
I try to specialize in making it

1653.24 --> 1657.22
tangible to the mind as it were

1661.279 --> 1666.38
but yeah to be fair I don't really get a

1664.94 --> 1670.46
lot of feedback

1666.38 --> 1673.279
what I do understand from most people

1670.46 --> 1675.64
is that they do kind of understand me as

1673.279 --> 1675.64
a person

1678.559 --> 1682.279
and which is weird

1680.299 --> 1684.9189999999999
in a way because

1682.279 --> 1686.72
I understand much more of like what I'm

1684.919 --> 1689.72
doing

1686.72 --> 1693.14
then I have a full grip of like

1689.72 --> 1696.3990000000001
looking at myself as a as a separate

1693.14 --> 1696.3990000000001
human being

1697.1 --> 1703.82
but I just realized through you guys

1700.94 --> 1707.1200000000001
that it is understood who I am even

1703.82 --> 1709.22
though I understand myself less

1707.12 --> 1711.6789999999999
think

1709.22 --> 1713.539
it's just I do understand I have a very

1711.679 --> 1716.6000000000001
high grip even of things that I do it's

1713.539 --> 1719.779
just that somehow

1716.6 --> 1721.82
I can't really unify it in a complete

1719.779 --> 1724.7
picture

1721.82 --> 1727.779
to really understand what kind of

1724.7 --> 1727.779
impression I'm making

1730.039 --> 1733.84
but because of everybody

1734.179 --> 1739.48
like because you people remind me who I

1737.299 --> 1739.48
am

1739.58 --> 1745.6999999999998
through your reflections

1741.98 --> 1747.2
and also show me when I'm truly like off

1745.7 --> 1749.779
balance

1747.2 --> 1752.8400000000001
because I can be like stuck in some kind

1749.779 --> 1756.26
of tirade or train a thought and then

1752.84 --> 1758.779
things happen and I don't notice you

1756.26 --> 1760.58
guys do

1758.779 --> 1763.039
and then

1760.58 --> 1765.98
just somebody telling me like without

1763.039 --> 1768.919
being a gamma or without obviously

1765.98 --> 1772.159
having their ego invested in the

1768.919 --> 1773.779
situation to respond just tell me like

1772.159 --> 1776.8400000000001
hey dude whoa

1773.779 --> 1779.059
and then I like whoa what oh

1776.84 --> 1782.9189999999999
I wasn't noticing that that is happening

1779.059 --> 1782.9189999999999
I definitely don't want to go there

1783.2 --> 1787.3600000000001
anyway

1784.46 --> 1787.3600000000001
uh

1793.159 --> 1797.6000000000001
don't stress about I'm not stressing

1795.35 --> 1801.6789999999999
[Music]

1797.6 --> 1803.899
I am not stressing I'm just trying to

1801.679 --> 1807.3400000000001
clarify

1803.899 --> 1807.34
I am a being hungry though

1816.44 --> 1821.779
ah thanks for saying that Matthew all

1819.14 --> 1824.659
I think a good impression

1821.779 --> 1826.64
I don't know though like there are some

1824.659 --> 1829.64
moments if you isolate them then it's

1826.64 --> 1832.22
like really it looks really ugly and I

1829.64 --> 1836.0
have this weird thing

1832.22 --> 1837.6200000000001
about my I guess my spirit

1836.0 --> 1841.399
energy

1837.62 --> 1844.279
that if I'm like in like if there's bad

1841.399 --> 1846.32
[ __ ] that's on my soul

1844.279 --> 1849.08
like bad thoughts I can't get rid of

1846.32 --> 1852.3799999999999
yeah something that hit me in a bad way

1849.08 --> 1855.74
then it really does almost like ooze off

1852.38 --> 1858.679
me and I become like people suddenly

1855.74 --> 1863.0
want to avoid me naturally

1858.679 --> 1865.039
and that's well yeah I say I declare

1863.0 --> 1867.26
basically it's part of my sensitivity it

1865.039 --> 1869.84
happens to me some days I'm bad and then

1867.26 --> 1871.64
it's just like ah I got super pissed off

1869.84 --> 1874.8799999999999
at everything

1871.64 --> 1877.039
and then I'm still like hi I'm nice

1874.88 --> 1880.279
person like I don't do that to anybody's

1877.039 --> 1882.62
face ever ever but I am pissed off in

1880.279 --> 1883.82
between moments but people are still

1882.62 --> 1887.84
kind of like

1883.82 --> 1890.539
hey very very careful even though I've

1887.84 --> 1892.9399999999998
never spat out angrily against anybody

1890.539 --> 1895.22
but it's just

1892.94 --> 1897.44
even though I keep it locked and it's

1895.22 --> 1899.8990000000001
still radiating off me people still

1897.44 --> 1904.159
respond to that then right I'm just

1899.899 --> 1905.6589999999999
noticing all that I'm noticing it

1904.159 --> 1908.0
and

1905.659 --> 1911.2990000000002
also

1908.0 --> 1914.72
when you realize that it it because you

1911.299 --> 1918.98
get into trouble like internally with a

1914.72 --> 1921.08
puzzle because you can't really control

1918.98 --> 1922.22
your mood

1921.08 --> 1925.399
you see

1922.22 --> 1927.98
right I barely can sometimes it's just

1925.399 --> 1931.1
it's a day and it's wrong things go even

1927.98 --> 1933.799
if you did everything you could just one

1931.1 --> 1936.799
person is just sloppy in the wrong way

1933.799 --> 1939.74
and like through them like a demon like

1936.799 --> 1941.899
instantly just relax lashes out breaks

1939.74 --> 1942.6200000000001
out you've seen it happen to me life on

1941.899 --> 1944.7199999999998
air

1942.62 --> 1948.1399999999999
right

1944.72 --> 1950.74
because I'm actually not feeling good

1948.14 --> 1953.659
I'm just really trying

1950.74 --> 1956.0
but nothing sneaky but I'm trying to

1953.659 --> 1959.5
hold it in and just

1956.0 --> 1959.5
not let it ruin things

1961.76 --> 1966.1589999999999
but it's still kind of radiates off me

1966.86 --> 1972.799
and that by the way is not just with

1969.74 --> 1975.44
anger or something or or like

1972.799 --> 1976.94
feeling really bad about myself also

1975.44 --> 1980.6000000000001
oozes it off me

1976.94 --> 1983.779
people get like ill really they do

1980.6 --> 1986.24
right but when I'm feeling like like

1983.779 --> 1989.899
yeah I'm worthy

1986.24 --> 1993.2
and like I'm attractive to women

1989.899 --> 1995.6
I got a mustache I'm looking cohesive I

1993.2 --> 1998.059
obviously don't have any markings

1995.6 --> 2000.76
from like companies that own me as a

1998.059 --> 2002.26
slave without me realizing it I have no

2000.76 --> 2004.96
logos

2002.26 --> 2008.74
of any companies on me anywhere not no

2004.96 --> 2012.039
text right I wear only jewelry that I

2008.74 --> 2014.26
made everything is super worn because I

2012.039 --> 2017.019
stuck to it for like 10 years it's

2014.26 --> 2019.6589999999999
really visible I know this is attractive

2017.019 --> 2021.76
to some women so I have like this

2019.659 --> 2024.5800000000002
knowledge based confidence

2021.76 --> 2027.22
when I feel good because when I don't

2024.58 --> 2028.899
feel good I just kind of feel like I'm a

2027.22 --> 2032.32
bum or something that's trying to

2028.899 --> 2033.9399999999998
pretend to be a real person that's very

2032.32 --> 2036.82
different setting but when I feel good

2033.94 --> 2038.8600000000001
it works and suddenly like women just

2036.82 --> 2042.12
light up

2038.86 --> 2042.12
when they see you in there

2042.88 --> 2048.639
and weirdly sometimes even little kids

2046.0 --> 2049.78
too they really like like what hey

2048.639 --> 2052.06
mister

2049.78 --> 2053.32
that kind of effect they want my

2052.06 --> 2055.7799999999997
attention

2053.32 --> 2058.3
and I'm loving it

2055.78 --> 2060.2200000000003
not that I really like go towards kids

2058.3 --> 2062.619
and give them a lot of attention I'm

2060.22 --> 2064.2999999999997
like yeah sorry I don't really know you

2062.619 --> 2067.599
but I'll

2064.3 --> 2068.8
I'll compose myself with an example of

2067.599 --> 2070.2000000000003
like

2068.8 --> 2074.139
like yeah

2070.2 --> 2077.4399999999996
if it's a well it's usually little boys

2074.139 --> 2078.879
and then I'm like yeah be a man like

2077.44 --> 2081.2400000000002
don't worry things will be all right

2078.879 --> 2081.24
just

2082.839 --> 2087.339
just

2084.879 --> 2090.639
don't give in to weakness like I just

2087.339 --> 2091.96
try to radiate that and I think that

2090.639 --> 2094.0
helps

2091.96 --> 2096.94
I think that a lot of little boys need

2094.0 --> 2098.26
that and they often don't really get it

2096.94 --> 2101.5
from their dad they might have a good

2098.26 --> 2103.599
dad but strong dads and here in the

2101.5 --> 2108.22
Netherlands especially is like that's

2103.599 --> 2110.8
rare like actual like robust strong man

2108.22 --> 2113.859
it's kind of rare to find here most are

2110.8 --> 2115.8390000000004
kind of like well

2113.859 --> 2117.94
a bit cocked

2115.839 --> 2120.42
right and they try their best but

2117.94 --> 2123.88
they're still cocking and like nobody's

2120.42 --> 2127.7200000000003
nobody's challenging him on it right and

2123.88 --> 2129.579
then everybody gets like that so

2127.72 --> 2131.5
but that's some of the things that

2129.579 --> 2133.3
happen like when I feel good and

2131.5 --> 2134.859
confident and I can back it with

2133.3 --> 2137.8590000000004
knowledge

2134.859 --> 2140.92
it's not just oh I feel kind of good no

2137.859 --> 2143.56
it's backed with knowledge

2140.92 --> 2145.66
that sustains it but it's got to be

2143.56 --> 2148.9
fused first God

2145.66 --> 2150.94
be right because if I don't

2148.9 --> 2152.859
feel good

2150.94 --> 2155.2000000000003
then that knowledge is completely

2152.859 --> 2156.52
useless because I kind of don't want to

2155.2 --> 2160.6189999999997
be attractive

2156.52 --> 2160.619
I don't feel like that it yeah

2161.079 --> 2165.3590000000004
you can confirm from the Netherlands

2162.88 --> 2165.359
yeah yeah

2170.93 --> 2175.0789999999997
[Music]

2172.72 --> 2175.0789999999997
right

2176.44 --> 2182.079
right and when I do that in a way I am

2179.619 --> 2184.3
very defiant to the system when I really

2182.079 --> 2186.28
use that confidence and strength and

2184.3 --> 2188.8
everybody's drawn to that

2186.28 --> 2192.5400000000004
I know that's like

2188.8 --> 2192.54
in defiance of the program

2193.66 --> 2199.1189999999997
and that if I'd be like interconnected

2196.18 --> 2203.02
with a lot of people like jobs and [ __ ]

2199.119 --> 2203.02
and friends that

2203.44 --> 2208.42
it would be impossible almost to keep

2206.2 --> 2210.16
doing that because they're all gonna try

2208.42 --> 2212.6800000000003
to pull you down

2210.16 --> 2214.96
because you just shine too much unless

2212.68 --> 2217.839
you completely dominate them and don't

2214.96 --> 2219.88
get into like trouble or

2217.839 --> 2222.2799999999997
then

2219.88 --> 2225.4
you're gonna be dragged down

2222.28 --> 2228.8390000000004
so it is almost like a luxury I also

2225.4 --> 2228.839
have because of my isolation

2231.28 --> 2235.42
that's what makes it much more stable

2233.2 --> 2237.7599999999998
and it can hold on to it

2235.42 --> 2242.2200000000003
but I can't really

2237.76 --> 2242.2200000000003
build a fast network of

2242.26 --> 2247.9
workers and

2244.78 --> 2250.1400000000003
colleagues directly around me here like

2247.9 --> 2250.14
that

2253.359 --> 2257.02
foreign

2254.76 --> 2261.46
because you have a strong character

2257.02 --> 2263.859
others yes but Matthew Hall I I

2261.46 --> 2265.54
don't want you to skip on basically the

2263.859 --> 2267.16
point that I was trying to make right

2265.54 --> 2271.5
because

2267.16 --> 2271.5
it doesn't always work

2273.52 --> 2277.96
it only works when I feel

2276.579 --> 2280.0
good

2277.96 --> 2285.599
when I embrace it

2280.0 --> 2285.599
when I feel I have a purpose being that

2288.28 --> 2294.2200000000003
because when I don't then I'm told I I

2291.579 --> 2295.78
will not be seen as having a strong

2294.22 --> 2298.18
character

2295.78 --> 2302.1400000000003
and that's just a fact

2298.18 --> 2304.839
and sometimes even like online or

2302.14 --> 2307.54
like certain days on the Flat Earth

2304.839 --> 2310.72
debate I just I'm just stumbling and I'm

2307.54 --> 2312.82
like I I'm not a strong character it

2310.72 --> 2316.18
happens and like

2312.82 --> 2318.099
don't block that out it is true I am not

2316.18 --> 2320.2599999999998
always a strong character

2318.099 --> 2323.2000000000003
what I'm really trying to work on

2320.26 --> 2326.7400000000002
dealing with it and I'd say that the

2323.2 --> 2329.4399999999996
amount of strength moments are are

2326.74 --> 2332.74
already outnumbering the moments of

2329.44 --> 2335.16
weakness by far it used to be the other

2332.74 --> 2335.16
way around

2335.8 --> 2340.5600000000004
I started out in Long prolonged Darkness

2341.44 --> 2346.42
like isolation and like really sweaty

2344.32 --> 2350.2200000000003
paranoia and like I don't want to see

2346.42 --> 2350.2200000000003
the light like that bad

2352.42 --> 2360.16
and dwelling upon gamma things but but

2355.599 --> 2362.56
not like gamma bullying I've always I've

2360.16 --> 2365.0789999999997
never done that I've always avoided that

2362.56 --> 2368.56
but that's partially because just I have

2365.079 --> 2372.9
been subjected to bullying even as a kid

2368.56 --> 2372.9
and maybe extremely intolerant to it

2373.72 --> 2376.3199999999997
uh

2380.92 --> 2388.839
go do some free service work

2384.76 --> 2391.8
work acid what why

2388.839 --> 2391.7999999999997
and who are you

2403.359 --> 2407.819
yeah random guy yeah

2405.579 --> 2407.819
no

2408.04 --> 2412.74
I I'm not gonna do that

2414.819 --> 2417.96
why would I do that

2418.3 --> 2421.6600000000003
we met in the coffee shop all right

2420.28 --> 2424.26
right

2421.66 --> 2424.2599999999998
all right

2426.339 --> 2431.859
purpose

2429.04 --> 2435.22
sorry do I look like I'm

2431.859 --> 2436.96
having a lack of purpose here

2435.22 --> 2440.7599999999998
you really think that what I'm doing

2436.96 --> 2440.76
here might show that it is pointless

2443.619 --> 2448.54
is there no purpose here

2446.14 --> 2451.18
I think I have plenty of purpose I think

2448.54 --> 2453.0
I already have a mission I have

2451.18 --> 2459.0
very

2453.0 --> 2459.0
productive way to spend my day every day

2459.339 --> 2466.54
even though yeah originally like if you

2463.3 --> 2470.94
generally do that activity

2466.54 --> 2470.94
which like hysterically is

2471.4 --> 2474.339
mostly

2473.079 --> 2477.52
like

2474.339 --> 2480.5789999999997
drinking some beers smoking some joints

2477.52 --> 2483.18
watching a lot of media watching some

2480.579 --> 2483.1800000000003
movies

2483.22 --> 2489.2799999999997
playing some games going to bed that's

2485.98 --> 2492.4
my life here's the thing though if

2489.28 --> 2494.5600000000004
that's if that was all it will be a

2492.4 --> 2496.7200000000003
complete waste of time

2494.56 --> 2499.2999999999997
it will be a complete waste of time if

2496.72 --> 2504.359
it that was just it

2499.3 --> 2504.3590000000004
right it's not just it

2505.0 --> 2510.119
with all those things

2508.48 --> 2514.0
I really

2510.119 --> 2517.859
prioritize to spend my time wisely I

2514.0 --> 2517.859
don't watch stupid [ __ ]

2518.02 --> 2522.28
right and I'm learning about

2520.3 --> 2524.98
psychological warfare I'm learning about

2522.28 --> 2526.8390000000004
the program the in the programming that

2524.98 --> 2527.92
people are being subjected to through

2526.839 --> 2529.96
media

2527.92 --> 2532.54
and I need to know

2529.96 --> 2536.819
because it's part of what I do

2532.54 --> 2536.819
right also I do dream walking

2537.22 --> 2540.8799999999997
with it all

2538.66 --> 2543.64
I basically

2540.88 --> 2545.859
as I listen sometimes I literally go

2543.64 --> 2547.66
walk in their shoes and not literally

2545.859 --> 2550.0
spiritually

2547.66 --> 2552.64
and I'm like

2550.0 --> 2555.04
well really good at it

2552.64 --> 2557.98
I think there might be some like pretty

2555.04 --> 2559.599
surreal effects out there I mean I have

2557.98 --> 2561.64
pretty much

2559.599 --> 2565.6600000000003
open up myself

2561.64 --> 2568.2999999999997
or interdimensional inquiry sounds kind

2565.66 --> 2571.48
of silly right but I'm quite certain

2568.3 --> 2573.88
that it is actually there and that some

2571.48 --> 2575.92
people might do that

2573.88 --> 2578.1400000000003
that through the other dimension they

2575.92 --> 2580.7200000000003
face me and

2578.14 --> 2583.7799999999997
ask me questions

2580.72 --> 2585.9399999999996
and then like there isn't all this

2583.78 --> 2589.8390000000004
clutter from the material world

2585.94 --> 2592.42
interface to stop you from finding

2589.839 --> 2593.68
the Purity to really get the answers

2592.42 --> 2596.079
that you sought

2593.68 --> 2598.72
I can do that

2596.079 --> 2602.319
I can even do that in the physical world

2598.72 --> 2603.3999999999996
it's just people can get the focus to do

2602.319 --> 2607.92
that

2603.4 --> 2607.92
the clutter clutter everywhere

2611.74 --> 2620.2799999999997
[Music]

2615.52 --> 2620.28
then I misunderstood what you said yeah

2622.72 --> 2629.68
you probably did no I wasn't looking for

2626.2 --> 2634.06
oh my life is so terrible I need

2629.68 --> 2637.0789999999997
something to do I'm so bored excuse me

2634.06 --> 2637.0789999999997
[ __ ] hell

2637.48 --> 2641.819
if any if I'm anything it's not bored

2643.24 --> 2647.8799999999997
I find

2645.099 --> 2651.7000000000003
everything quite overwhelming at times

2647.88 --> 2653.26
basic things can be even overwhelming at

2651.7 --> 2656.7999999999997
times not through the way that I'm gonna

2653.26 --> 2658.5400000000004
look at some kind of like autistic spasm

2656.8 --> 2661.9
or something

2658.54 --> 2664.54
although I did actually have those in my

2661.9 --> 2666.94
teens at times from being overwhelmed

2664.54 --> 2668.98
okay

2666.94 --> 2671.079
it's just that

2668.98 --> 2673.42
I don't know man maybe my freaking

2671.079 --> 2676.6600000000003
pineal gland is just standard open

2673.42 --> 2679.2400000000002
always because I just get so much

2676.66 --> 2681.22
freaking input from everything from all

2679.24 --> 2683.859
my senses and I'm seeing so much

2681.22 --> 2687.8799999999997
structure it's just it gets a little

2683.859 --> 2689.7999999999997
overwhelming just doing nothing can be

2687.88 --> 2692.76
overwhelming because there's so much

2689.8 --> 2692.76
sensory input

2693.16 --> 2698.7599999999998
right and this is also potentially a

2696.52 --> 2698.7599999999998
problem

2699.4 --> 2705.339
because it's very hard to keep basic for

2702.88 --> 2707.619
me and to just like oh yeah somebody's

2705.339 --> 2709.599
of course just not really concerned with

2707.619 --> 2710.98
anything kind of bored with the day and

2709.599 --> 2713.6400000000003
then I'm like

2710.98 --> 2713.64
hi

2714.819 --> 2720.04
did you know

2717.22 --> 2723.8799999999997
you know that look at the gods calling

2720.04 --> 2726.579
for your reach up I'm like ah no no I

2723.88 --> 2728.819
can't just disturb people's day like

2726.579 --> 2728.819
that

2730.2 --> 2736.5989999999997
unless they like come looking for me

2733.839 --> 2738.7
and give me the sign like hey I want

2736.599 --> 2742.02
some of what you got

2738.7 --> 2742.02
and then I can do that

2742.359 --> 2748.54
I'm sort of having that those kind of

2745.119 --> 2750.099
moments with my uh my roommate and it's

2748.54 --> 2752.88
great

2750.099 --> 2752.88
love it

2759.28 --> 2763.98
why do you need to search for more

2761.68 --> 2763.98
information

2764.14 --> 2769.319
sorry information what do you mean

2766.96 --> 2769.319
information

2799.48 --> 2805.2400000000002
right yeah Matthew Hall well when I say

2802.839 --> 2808.24
dream walking

2805.24 --> 2810.339
dream walking is what you can learn to

2808.24 --> 2812.4399999999996
do with daydreaming

2810.339 --> 2814.359
because daydreaming

2812.44 --> 2816.2200000000003
especially when you're young and you do

2814.359 --> 2818.819
that a lot you can't help it you just

2816.22 --> 2822.16
fall into Daydream and be freaking

2818.819 --> 2826.06
surreal and powerful and like weird [ __ ]

2822.16 --> 2826.06
can actually happen like

2827.56 --> 2831.339
seriously you're daydreaming you think

2829.839 --> 2833.2
about something and suddenly you get

2831.339 --> 2835.599
this giant slap in the face and fall

2833.2 --> 2839.46
over backward

2835.599 --> 2839.46
and literally nobody did that

2839.619 --> 2842.2200000000003
right

2842.38 --> 2847.839
well it if you when you Daydream usually

2845.38 --> 2849.2200000000003
you're just subjected to it when you're

2847.839 --> 2850.2999999999997
younger you don't really know what's

2849.22 --> 2853.2999999999997
happening

2850.3 --> 2855.94
you're just gonna have to be secure to

2853.3 --> 2857.619
your to like the lights to the Purity

2855.94 --> 2860.859
and to not

2857.619 --> 2862.059
get caught up in Bad Things

2860.859 --> 2863.5589999999997
because then it's just going to be

2862.059 --> 2867.119
nightmares

2863.559 --> 2867.119
and release scary

2868.48 --> 2875.579
but when you're older you should be able

2871.119 --> 2875.579
to realize just what that is and that

2875.68 --> 2880.839
it's there's like this thing a lot of

2878.92 --> 2884.2000000000003
people when they go through it they

2880.839 --> 2886.24
don't really like it they feel like it's

2884.2 --> 2889.54
an Affliction almost or it becomes that

2886.24 --> 2891.8799999999997
and then they like lay it down they turn

2889.54 --> 2893.619
it off and they lay it down as in like

2891.88 --> 2896.619
oh that's just daydreaming that's for

2893.619 --> 2898.359
kids I don't have time for that

2896.619 --> 2901.0
and then they completely forget

2898.359 --> 2902.5
everything about it and they don't turn

2901.0 --> 2905.319
it back on

2902.5 --> 2907.0
or maybe like randomly but they don't

2905.319 --> 2910.24
want it anymore

2907.0 --> 2911.619
well I did not do that I actively did

2910.24 --> 2913.0
not do that

2911.619 --> 2915.1600000000003
and I thought

2913.0 --> 2916.96
there's so much that I've experienced I

2915.16 --> 2921.819
can do things with this

2916.96 --> 2925.54
is nature this is handed in my design

2921.819 --> 2928.48
to just lay it down would be

2925.54 --> 2931.0589999999997
like a waste foreign

2928.48 --> 2933.72
I mean God doesn't design things without

2931.059 --> 2933.7200000000003
a purpose

2936.04 --> 2938.579
uh

2944.14 --> 2947.7599999999998
so now I do dream walking

2949.54 --> 2953.619
and a lot of the times I'm literally

2951.52 --> 2955.78
just walking back and forth

2953.619 --> 2958.48
now

2955.78 --> 2960.579
it is it might visually kind of look

2958.48 --> 2962.619
like somebody that's like really worried

2960.579 --> 2964.96
like then they go back and forth because

2962.619 --> 2967.7200000000003
they're kind of nervous right well

2964.96 --> 2970.359
that's not happening

2967.72 --> 2973.7799999999997
I'm not walking back and forth like that

2970.359 --> 2976.0
dude if I was like

2973.78 --> 2979.119
Outdoors or something I'd freaking walk

2976.0 --> 2982.599
Ley lines dream walking long lay lines

2979.119 --> 2984.339
also dream walk outside when I go to the

2982.599 --> 2986.819
forest this just happens like always

2984.339 --> 2986.819
happens

2995.38 --> 3001.619
right and yeah

2998.02 --> 3004.14
being a cannabis smoker does make it

3001.619 --> 3006.96
even more in your face

3004.14 --> 3009.7799999999997
easier to engage with but even without

3006.96 --> 3014.64
it even my sober completely sober times

3009.78 --> 3017.579
it just happens it happens anyway

3014.64 --> 3021.48
right it's not like this only started

3017.579 --> 3023.099
like after 15 when I first had my first

3021.48 --> 3026.16
Puff

3023.099 --> 3029.599
right secretly

3026.16 --> 3029.5989999999997
it's not legal don't do that

3029.94 --> 3037.859
before that I I potentially headed more

3035.7 --> 3041.5789999999997
right and this is also generally said

3037.859 --> 3044.16
that hey you sometimes you need your

3041.579 --> 3046.619
dreams back you gotta like really cut

3044.16 --> 3048.96
down on smoking the cannabis

3046.619 --> 3051.3
because in general it's sad that if you

3048.96 --> 3053.4
smoke like a lot of cannabis a big dose

3051.3 --> 3054.9
or something for your doing it's going

3053.4 --> 3058.079
to like kind of

3054.9 --> 3062.42
make you bypass the dream face

3058.079 --> 3062.42
you might rest physically really well

3063.24 --> 3065.839
right

3066.059 --> 3072.3
now I don't smoke a lot and I am having

3069.9 --> 3075.1800000000003
quite a few dreams

3072.3 --> 3077.2200000000003
like when I sleep now the actual dream

3075.18 --> 3079.5589999999997
dreams in your sleep right not dream

3077.22 --> 3082.0789999999997
walking which is

3079.559 --> 3085.0400000000004
sort of halfway

3082.079 --> 3085.04
like daydream

3087.36 --> 3090.51
[Music]

3106.859 --> 3111.18
right yeah Matthew look if you have if

3109.559 --> 3112.6800000000003
you're already developing your own

3111.18 --> 3115.14
system

3112.68 --> 3117.839
on how to turn it off or on

3115.14 --> 3119.2799999999997
then that you need to keep that to

3117.839 --> 3121.68
yourself

3119.28 --> 3124.8
you don't want to just publicly hand out

3121.68 --> 3128.16
like key mechanisms for you

3124.8 --> 3131.6400000000003
unless there is no key mechanisms

3128.16 --> 3134.2799999999997
there's no trigger words or anything

3131.64 --> 3136.44
it's just your conscious decision or

3134.28 --> 3140.1600000000003
something

3136.44 --> 3144.079
like I'm super open because I have no

3140.16 --> 3144.0789999999997
real keywords it is because

3144.839 --> 3150.54
I've thrown off so much

3147.72 --> 3152.9399999999996
that I feel I can do it

3150.54 --> 3156.44
I can be that open because I'm almost

3152.94 --> 3156.44
impervious in ways

3157.619 --> 3162.559
because of how I've done things how I've

3159.78 --> 3162.559
developed myself

3172.02 --> 3175.7599999999998
what do you mean with open

3194.28 --> 3199.2000000000003
right obviously you're having a lot of

3197.4 --> 3202.2200000000003
trouble following the conversation there

3199.2 --> 3202.22
32 huh

3203.339 --> 3209.989
foreign

3205.2 --> 3209.989
[Music]

3216.44 --> 3220.02
sure if you want to share that

3218.94 --> 3222.48
fine

3220.02 --> 3225.8
just be very careful with sharing like

3222.48 --> 3225.8
personal mechanisms

3240.66 --> 3243.859
derp alert

3244.68 --> 3250.2599999999998
yeah

3247.2 --> 3253.3799999999997
I mean I can't say all that without

3250.26 --> 3255.0
having some gamma revenge for those that

3253.38 --> 3256.6800000000003
don't understand anything I just said

3255.0 --> 3259.74
because they don't even have the senses

3256.68 --> 3262.5589999999997
left but they did hear the statements of

3259.74 --> 3264.1189999999997
dominance and let that go even though

3262.559 --> 3266.46
they have no [ __ ] clue what I'm

3264.119 --> 3269.059
talking about

3266.46 --> 3269.059
huh

3280.52 --> 3287.48
hey Jim West yeah

3283.98 --> 3287.48
I didn't even read the question

3291.599 --> 3297.7400000000002
like what why would I see a doctor

3294.24 --> 3297.74
anyway or what

3302.64 --> 3309.2599999999998
is a doctor gonna tell me that I can't

3305.4 --> 3309.26
figure out myself seriously

3321.66 --> 3324.319
foreign

3325.94 --> 3329.2400000000002
yeah I know

3332.88 --> 3337.98
I learned to do that before I I use

3336.119 --> 3341.1600000000003
drugs

3337.98 --> 3343.68
right I learned that like around when I

3341.16 --> 3347.339
was 12 I think

3343.68 --> 3349.68
when I basically was offered the the

3347.339 --> 3351.66
reflections from everybody like oh

3349.68 --> 3353.64
daydreaming is for kids you're not a kid

3351.66 --> 3356.52
anymore you're supposed to be a cool

3353.64 --> 3359.7599999999998
wannabe adult now

3356.52 --> 3362.04
well I never let go of daydreaming and I

3359.76 --> 3363.0
I actually kind of embraced it as like

3362.04 --> 3364.619
oh

3363.0 --> 3366.72
well

3364.619 --> 3368.339
I guess I'm just gonna do this magic

3366.72 --> 3372.0589999999997
with it then

3368.339 --> 3375.68
good stuff only good stuff like

3372.059 --> 3380.0
in honor of The Lord of the Rings elves

3375.68 --> 3380.0
and that sort of spirit

3380.04 --> 3383.4
hey

3381.059 --> 3385.8590000000004
I'm named after it so I have a very good

3383.4 --> 3389.119
anchor for for such things

3385.859 --> 3389.119
right say my name

3393.0 --> 3398.28
and then I learned eventually also about

3395.28 --> 3400.26
like dream walking from aboriginals and

3398.28 --> 3401.52
it was like yeah dude that's freaking

3400.26 --> 3404.28
what I do

3401.52 --> 3408.059
it was like almost outraged like not

3404.28 --> 3409.98
like oh yeah yeah it's mine no no it's

3408.059 --> 3412.7400000000002
just like dude why are you having to

3409.98 --> 3415.14
recognize that that's what I freaking do

3412.74 --> 3417.1189999999997
I I just heard about this you should

3415.14 --> 3420.7799999999997
have known why would didn't anybody tell

3417.119 --> 3423.5
me like this is what I do this is

3420.78 --> 3423.5
dreamwalk

3424.319 --> 3430.02
anyway that's what I felt I've never

3426.839 --> 3431.7599999999998
actually met aboriginals face to face I

3430.02 --> 3435.079
think

3431.76 --> 3435.079
not consciously anyway

3435.18 --> 3441.839
although I've bumped into some

3437.46 --> 3444.48
like in the Dark World experience

3441.839 --> 3448.04
there's some of them are still out there

3444.48 --> 3448.04
doing that old thing

3468.59 --> 3471.739
[Music]

3475.04 --> 3478.82

3487.14 --> 3493.5589999999997

3493.559 --> 3496.559
ax320

3498.78 --> 3503.6400000000003
ah okay everything the report there is a

3501.42 --> 3506.059
flat Earth debates that's gonna go live

3503.64 --> 3506.0589999999997
at least

3509.4 --> 3512.46
where are the snacks yeah no snacks

3511.38 --> 3515.7000000000003
today

3512.46 --> 3519.079
I already had my castle before the show

3515.7 --> 3519.0789999999997
way before the show

3519.24 --> 3522.859
because I got up kind of early

3543.599 --> 3548.839
all right so yeah guys we got another

3545.76 --> 3548.8390000000004
half hour or so

3549.9 --> 3552.9
foreign

3553.28 --> 3558.98
enough about the whole dream walking

3555.599 --> 3558.98
thing that I do and all that

3559.079 --> 3563.4
it's what I do yeah

3561.299 --> 3565.74
a lot of people will probably think wow

3563.4 --> 3569.7000000000003
that's a giant waste of time

3565.74 --> 3571.9799999999996
well is it or what is what are you

3569.7 --> 3575.22
actually putting

3571.98 --> 3578.599
or laying down for

3575.22 --> 3578.5989999999997
for all that work

3584.7 --> 3590.64
not saying that you shouldn't do any

3586.559 --> 3592.98
it's absolutely not but I mean it's not

3590.64 --> 3595.5589999999997
just me just being a stick in the mud

3592.98 --> 3598.98
and like yeah no

3595.559 --> 3601.8590000000004
I I don't like

3598.98 --> 3604.38
not being like everybody else like I

3601.859 --> 3607.68
don't like that I am

3604.38 --> 3609.42
yeah not very Financial capable

3607.68 --> 3611.94
okay

3609.42 --> 3616.02
so yeah it is still alluring it's just

3611.94 --> 3617.28
that doing it the way I I do have as you

3616.02 --> 3619.38
lit

3617.28 --> 3621.8390000000004
certain level of focus

3619.38 --> 3626.94
dedication

3621.839 --> 3626.94
and just straightforwardness

3627.839 --> 3634.14
that I don't think I would have still

3629.88 --> 3636.44
had if I had just like integrated with

3634.14 --> 3636.44
everything

3636.78 --> 3641.4
you got to realize that before I even

3638.94 --> 3642.66
came on to the letter scene I was kind

3641.4 --> 3645.839
of a wussy

3642.66 --> 3650.3999999999996
compared to that I really was very much

3645.839 --> 3653.5789999999997
like a lot of hidden fear and [ __ ]

3650.4 --> 3655.02
oh I wasn't really a wussy I think

3653.579 --> 3658.2000000000003
but

3655.02 --> 3660.9
not not to be fair in a way I was but it

3658.2 --> 3665.46
still was good things but it was also

3660.9 --> 3668.4
just like kind of a scaredy cat in ways

3665.46 --> 3671.28
I've gotten rid of that

3668.4 --> 3673.799
by doing this

3671.28 --> 3677.2200000000003
by the engagement

3673.799 --> 3680.22
because it is work like this is work I

3677.22 --> 3683.52
do work yeah it's just me talking on the

3680.22 --> 3686.339
screen interacting with other people do

3683.52 --> 3688.98
going on other social media watching

3686.339 --> 3691.2
more social media watching movies and

3688.98 --> 3694.38
then doing it all over again yes

3691.2 --> 3696.839
but it is actually work

3694.38 --> 3699.359
I take it all very serious this is not

3696.839 --> 3702.9
just me wasting time and pretending like

3699.359 --> 3706.04
I'm doing something useful this is all

3702.9 --> 3706.04
very serious to me

3729.46 --> 3732.51
[Music]

3734.94 --> 3737.42
ah

3745.039 --> 3749.88
by the way Mark sergeant had like a

3748.2 --> 3752.8799999999997
pretty

3749.88 --> 3755.6400000000003
cool music video yesterday I don't know

3752.88 --> 3759.1400000000003
if you guys picked up on that

3755.64 --> 3759.14
like that was pretty cool song

3759.359 --> 3765.5989999999997
by media bear I don't know if he's

3762.059 --> 3769.02
actually a bear if it is like I would oh

3765.599 --> 3773.599
Benjamin Inspire type of bear but

3769.02 --> 3773.599
it's a pretty cool song check it out

3774.119 --> 3778.1600000000003
bumped it into it through Mark sergeant

3786.26 --> 3790.1600000000003
gaslighting me with psyups

3814.619 --> 3820.44
why don't I believe in Jesus the creator

3819.0 --> 3823.52
of God

3820.44 --> 3823.52
what the [ __ ]

3829.74 --> 3834.4799999999996
wow

3831.059 --> 3837.119
can I have a derp alert

3834.48 --> 3840.68
come on

3837.119 --> 3840.6800000000003
everything you said is wrong

3841.079 --> 3845.52
yeah

3842.48 --> 3847.5
gaslighting me with psyops that's what

3845.52 --> 3850.079
you're doing right now it's very typical

3847.5 --> 3852.359
it's like synchronization

3850.079 --> 3857.0
but from the Dark Side

3852.359 --> 3861.839
just as much tied into the whole

3857.0 --> 3861.839
redesigned Godly structure

3862.98 --> 3868.92
the darkness is basically their darkness

3865.5 --> 3872.52
and weakness is there to prove that

3868.92 --> 3874.619
what is weakness and that it exists

3872.52 --> 3877.799
and that the challenge never stops

3874.619 --> 3880.44
they're there to remind us that look at

3877.799 --> 3881.7599999999998
this Mr four guy in check

3880.44 --> 3886.38
right

3881.76 --> 3889.6800000000003
you think you're great well realize that

3886.38 --> 3892.02
under different circumstances God has

3889.68 --> 3896.64
had designated you a different type of

3892.02 --> 3900.2
path you could have become Mr four

3896.64 --> 3900.2
just think about it

3900.9 --> 3907.099
be honest

3902.4 --> 3907.099
are all created by the same God

3907.14 --> 3912.7799999999997
by the same designer

3909.42 --> 3916.2200000000003
with a purpose and Mr four was designed

3912.78 --> 3916.2200000000003
to be him

3916.38 --> 3919.98
and God does not design things without a

3918.96 --> 3922.079
function

3919.98 --> 3924.9
whether you ignore that function

3922.079 --> 3926.2200000000003
polarize against it and just cut it out

3924.9 --> 3929.099
of your mind or

3926.22 --> 3930.7799999999997
whether you actually embrace the

3929.099 --> 3935.1800000000003
challenge and then

3930.78 --> 3935.1800000000003
figure it out why are they like that

3935.64 --> 3941.7599999999998
and you can learn this all from one

3938.579 --> 3943.98
single comment all these things see see

3941.76 --> 3947.5200000000004
how incredible amounts of information

3943.98 --> 3951.059
people reveal

3947.52 --> 3954.38
without even knowing it

3951.059 --> 3954.38
that's amazing to me

3964.5 --> 3969.0
wow

3966.24 --> 3971.359
I don't know what freaking book you've

3969.0 --> 3974.28
been reading Mr for but

3971.359 --> 3977.299
that's insane

3974.28 --> 3977.299
you're uh

3979.079 --> 3985.02
your description of

3981.78 --> 3988.46
of like philosophical description makes

3985.02 --> 3988.46
absolutely no sense

3988.5 --> 3993.359
nobody I've never heard anybody claim

3990.78 --> 3995.1600000000003
that but you maybe some crazy person

3993.359 --> 3996.7799999999997
that I immediately wouldn't have taken

3995.16 --> 3999.5989999999997
series and thought is just tripping

3996.78 --> 4002.1800000000003
maybe you're just tripping

3999.599 --> 4005.059
but yeah it makes absolutely no sense

4002.18 --> 4007.839
what you're just saying

4005.059 --> 4007.8390000000004
uh

4010.4 --> 4015.15
yeah so you can start where is she

4013.22 --> 4016.52
damn it I need my derp alert

4015.15 --> 4019.819
[Music]

4016.52 --> 4022.18
and of course your overall presence and

4019.819 --> 4022.18
wisdom

4026.83 --> 4029.98
[Music]

4038.92 --> 4041.969
[Music]

4042.079 --> 4044.6800000000003
foreign

4083.92 --> 4090.44
you disagree with that like everything

4087.859 --> 4093.799
he said was wrong all of the statements

4090.44 --> 4096.5
none of it made any sense

4093.799 --> 4100.319
but okay fine

4096.5 --> 4103.509
I know Nathan doesn't own me

4100.319 --> 4103.509
[Music]

4128.9 --> 4131.9
foreign

4136.35 --> 4144.219
[Music]

4140.779 --> 4144.219
sensible if possible

4147.44 --> 4154.299
I mean do I need really need to

4150.319 --> 4154.299
go over the housekeeping questions

4154.58 --> 4159.739
since this guy says which is like the

4157.88 --> 4162.56
most Preposterous part

4159.739 --> 4165.199
wonder if a pref letters proof after

4162.56 --> 4167.7390000000005
1200 shows

4165.199 --> 4167.739
right

4189.14 --> 4192.679
yeah Matthew of course Christ and God

4191.54 --> 4195.08
are real

4192.679 --> 4196.76
there's a whole bunch of things that are

4195.08 --> 4198.159
real

4196.76 --> 4201.4400000000005
and

4198.159 --> 4202.879999999999
realize uniformly spiritually things

4201.44 --> 4206.36
that are real

4202.88 --> 4208.9400000000005
will will have been attempted to be

4206.36 --> 4212.659
distorted by power

4208.94 --> 4215.299999999999
and they usually end up winning

4212.659 --> 4217.46
over the mind

4215.3 --> 4220.400000000001
so that

4217.46 --> 4222.82
it's like spreading a rumor about evil

4220.4 --> 4225.62
about something

4222.82 --> 4228.08
traditionally very hard to actually get

4225.62 --> 4230.54
rid of like those rumors would persist

4228.08 --> 4232.64
for a very long time even after it had

4230.54 --> 4235.46
been officially revealed to be like a

4232.64 --> 4236.42
political lie or something it it tends

4235.46 --> 4239.0
to stick

4236.42 --> 4242.3
or it used to at least I mean now it's

4239.0 --> 4245.98
the internet age it's slightly different

4242.3 --> 4245.9800000000005
things do catch on quicker

4253.64 --> 4257.9800000000005
but yeah let's go to definitely

4258.32 --> 4261.28
definitely real

4262.54 --> 4267.0199999999995
although even at this point you know to

4264.92 --> 4269.86
call in God

4267.02 --> 4269.860000000001
is

4270.14 --> 4274.76
is almost like an oversimplification but

4273.14 --> 4277.84
I guess that's what it is that's the

4274.76 --> 4277.84
point but

4278.0 --> 4284.659
because I just have such a reverence for

4280.94 --> 4287.12
the infinite power that is kind of

4284.659 --> 4289.879999999999
palpable to me

4287.12 --> 4292.58
that he has that

4289.88 --> 4295.6990000000005
to just call it God to or hear other

4292.58 --> 4296.96
people talk about God like they have it

4295.699 --> 4301.28
like

4296.96 --> 4303.14
like if you truly understood or had a

4301.28 --> 4305.3
bigger understanding of God you would be

4303.14 --> 4308.5
very careful

4305.3 --> 4308.5
to invoke him

4309.08 --> 4313.94
that means like to call upon him to like

4311.9 --> 4316.239
have other people do things because it's

4313.94 --> 4316.239
like

4316.94 --> 4324.259999999999
that's almost like a blasphemy because

4320.719 --> 4326.0
of the design of all things it's like

4324.26 --> 4328.159000000001
you're downplaying you're the

4326.0 --> 4332.56
oversimplifier you're turning God into

4328.159 --> 4332.5599999999995
an icon again even in minor ways

4334.52 --> 4339.5
people have a tendency to do that it's

4337.4 --> 4342.32
the priesthood effect

4339.5 --> 4345.739
they all end up doing it

4342.32 --> 4347.5
invoking God for some

4345.739 --> 4351.159
human

4347.5 --> 4351.159
contemporary purpose

4353.48 --> 4358.54
I have no idea what they're saying

4357.32 --> 4361.099999999999
right

4358.54 --> 4363.92
led by

4361.1 --> 4366.4400000000005
Good Feeling readings

4363.92 --> 4369.02
like a trust

4366.44 --> 4371.299999999999
in like Christ and like that power and

4369.02 --> 4373.96
all that but still not really

4371.3 --> 4376.179
understanding it or you wouldn't do that

4373.96 --> 4379.159
in my opinion

4376.179 --> 4380.4800000000005
you'd be much more careful and humble

4379.159 --> 4382.9
with it

4380.48 --> 4385.28
right I think that like Catholicism

4382.9 --> 4387.08
which is like it's not even like the

4385.28 --> 4389.259999999999
people that are Catholic growing up like

4387.08 --> 4389.26
that

4389.78 --> 4397.82
it is evil like the church was evil like

4394.46 --> 4402.159
really freaking evil not Christian like

4397.82 --> 4402.159
they they stole Christ

4402.199 --> 4405.46
they stolen

4405.739 --> 4411.5599999999995
and they deranged so many things in

4408.92 --> 4413.659
there that's still echoed to this day by

4411.56 --> 4414.92
people that think they're the opponents

4413.659 --> 4416.659
of the church

4414.92 --> 4419.38
they think they're the opponents but

4416.659 --> 4422.839999999999
they basically Echo the same sentiments

4419.38 --> 4426.38
and conceptions in priesthood tools to

4422.84 --> 4427.64
hold on to that specifically come from

4426.38 --> 4429.5
them

4427.64 --> 4432.7390000000005
and they think they're their opponents

4429.5 --> 4437.32
but they use the same things

4432.739 --> 4437.32
and to see it everywhere everywhere

4442.699 --> 4448.159
people don't understand what Catholicism

4445.34 --> 4451.159000000001
like what that is like

4448.159 --> 4454.28
how they came to these conclusions that

4451.159 --> 4458.179
that they openly chanted and like

4454.28 --> 4461.36
directly lend upon with their power and

4458.179 --> 4464.6
their atrocities it's like if you oppose

4461.36 --> 4465.739
the word of God which is basically what

4464.6 --> 4470.7390000000005
they say

4465.739 --> 4470.739
then you are Satan and must be defeated

4471.56 --> 4475.580000000001
and that was there

4474.14 --> 4478.400000000001
right

4475.58 --> 4480.82
it's just pure power policy pure abuse

4478.4 --> 4483.739
like directly

4480.82 --> 4486.28
diametrically opposed to the Christ's

4483.739 --> 4486.28
teachings

4488.719 --> 4495.82
it's really a miracle it

4491.3 --> 4495.820000000001
that they flourished for so long

4498.14 --> 4507.55
under that sort of abuse

4501.13 --> 4507.55
[Music]

4510.8 --> 4517.0
do you believe the Bible to be true in

4513.5 --> 4517.0
every word no

4521.78 --> 4527.62
I don't think it's even it it's an

4524.84 --> 4531.32
assembled story

4527.62 --> 4533.5599999999995
inspired on a on a person that is real

4531.32 --> 4537.32
and the things that Jesus says

4533.56 --> 4539.900000000001
specifically noted even are real I think

4537.32 --> 4544.219
he really said that it's just an

4539.9 --> 4545.48
assembled story so no it is not true in

4544.219 --> 4548.54
every word

4545.48 --> 4551.08
there is incredible wisdom to be found

4548.54 --> 4551.08
there though

4552.62 --> 4558.679
but look at how freaking abuse it is it

4556.04 --> 4560.96
is all it's just made

4558.679 --> 4563.42
more contemporary there's a lot of the

4560.96 --> 4565.219
Timeless power is basically taken away

4563.42 --> 4568.4
in ways too

4565.219 --> 4570.38
people don't understand that about it a

4568.4 --> 4574.099999999999
lot of people get fixated over a very

4570.38 --> 4576.5
specific type of sentences and then lift

4574.1 --> 4578.780000000001
that out and start using it as a weapon

4576.5 --> 4582.44
in their obsessive devil persecution

4578.78 --> 4585.259999999999
which is diametrically opposed to

4582.44 --> 4588.159
Christ's teachings

4585.26 --> 4588.159000000001
foreign

4601.36 --> 4606.799999999999
what the [ __ ] are you talking about

4603.98 --> 4609.139999999999
I ABS you're not paying attention Mr

4606.8 --> 4613.1
four I already explained

4609.14 --> 4616.88
I I don't believe in God I know he has

4613.1 --> 4621.08
to exist I can feel it I can see it God

4616.88 --> 4623.54
is in everything God is the the one that

4621.08 --> 4627.5
hands out all information that passes

4623.54 --> 4629.96
through US everyone no exception all

4627.5 --> 4633.76
living things that have thoughts

4629.96 --> 4633.76
all those thoughts come from God

4636.8 --> 4642.9800000000005
and we're all literally designed

4639.38 --> 4646.400000000001
throughout time like um yeah

4642.98 --> 4648.5
a big play we get to choose we get the

4646.4 --> 4650.78
partially right to play through these

4648.5 --> 4652.1
choices but the rules are all there in

4650.78 --> 4655.4
the design

4652.1 --> 4657.92
believe in God no I absolutely know he's

4655.4 --> 4660.44
real and I think that the way people

4657.92 --> 4663.14
invoke God

4660.44 --> 4665.36
in churches and all that is Blasphemous

4663.14 --> 4668.0
they have no freaking idea what they're

4665.36 --> 4670.5199999999995
doing and they're downplaying it and

4668.0 --> 4674.42
just making another icon

4670.52 --> 4676.6
making another personified icon out of

4674.42 --> 4676.6
it

4677.0 --> 4682.06
and downplay his true Majesty

4686.84 --> 4692.900000000001
so yeah

4689.54 --> 4695.719
I am not a non-believer oh well yeah

4692.9 --> 4697.28
technically no I don't believe things I

4695.719 --> 4699.88
don't believe things that I don't know

4697.28 --> 4699.88
are real

4701.12 --> 4706.4
it's like believing is like do you trust

4704.719 --> 4709.46
your senses

4706.4 --> 4711.44
before you trust your do you trust your

4709.46 --> 4714.219
senses to tell you the truth before your

4711.44 --> 4718.58
cognition can catch up with them yeah

4714.219 --> 4722.3
yes yes I do I trust my senses

4718.58 --> 4725.38
before my cognition is able to catch up

4722.3 --> 4725.38
with them yes

4727.04 --> 4730.04
foreign

4734.0 --> 4740.02
people say yeah those people are kind of

4737.42 --> 4740.02
[ __ ]

4740.239 --> 4745.419999999999
and they probably watch Star Trek six

4760.28 --> 4766.3
don't believe little G God I don't give

4763.34 --> 4766.3
a [ __ ] dude

4771.199 --> 4773.799999999999
all right

4775.28 --> 4779.9
if you don't believe in God to be a real

4777.62 --> 4782.0599999999995
then you just didn't think clearly

4779.9 --> 4783.739
enough about it because there is no way

4782.06 --> 4786.7390000000005
anything here

4783.739 --> 4789.62
it can exist as it does without there

4786.739 --> 4791.78
being a original creator

4789.62 --> 4795.5599999999995
and designer of it all throughout time

4791.78 --> 4797.239
there is no other logically consistent

4795.56 --> 4802.1
way

4797.239 --> 4802.099999999999
to even approach existence

4802.719 --> 4806.32
ontological primitive

4806.38 --> 4811.36
besides the design is in everything

4811.639 --> 4818.96
like structure itself

4815.42 --> 4820.76
is part of the design structure itself

4818.96 --> 4825.9800000000005
is

4820.76 --> 4828.88
the patterns that lead to the design it

4825.98 --> 4828.879999999999
is part of the design

4829.34 --> 4835.159000000001
that material exists is part of the

4833.6 --> 4837.4400000000005
design

4835.159 --> 4840.799999999999
I don't think material existed before

4837.44 --> 4843.5599999999995
God basically manifested it

4840.8 --> 4845.78
even though in the Bible it is like oh

4843.56 --> 4848.06
he arrived in somewhere and it was

4845.78 --> 4849.199
something was already there yeah that's

4848.06 --> 4852.38
a really

4849.199 --> 4854.659
nice story though about that it is

4852.38 --> 4856.82
interesting it is very rich of

4854.659 --> 4859.54
information

4856.82 --> 4859.54
but

4863.719 --> 4869.78
I still think it is kind of filling in

4866.48 --> 4872.919999999999
the blank that's just like how are you

4869.78 --> 4872.92
certain about that

4873.04 --> 4878.84
[Music]

4876.199 --> 4881.719
what happened before that

4878.84 --> 4884.719
right what was God doing before that

4881.719 --> 4887.44
maybe they left out a previous part

4884.719 --> 4891.02
where he literally just like

4887.44 --> 4893.36
dense densified spirit in and like

4891.02 --> 4895.46
created a framework in order for a

4893.36 --> 4897.799999999999
material to be able to come into

4895.46 --> 4900.32
existence maybe they left that part out

4897.8 --> 4903.58
how would you know yeah it's the

4900.32 --> 4903.58
freaking Catholic Church

4904.04 --> 4908.96
that has got all this

4906.56 --> 4911.120000000001
under their control they sent out people

4908.96 --> 4913.96
to erase information they sent out

4911.12 --> 4916.699
Jesuits long times ago to literally

4913.96 --> 4920.6
destroy ancient wisdoms

4916.699 --> 4922.94
out there that was Kept Secret okay how

4920.6 --> 4925.639
do you know that Parts aren't even left

4922.94 --> 4929.419999999999
out of this particular Genesis story

4925.639 --> 4930.32
maybe there is a a preface and it's left

4929.42 --> 4933.38
out

4930.32 --> 4935.78
you don't get to they just don't they

4933.38 --> 4937.9400000000005
didn't put it in how would you know it

4935.78 --> 4940.78
was assembled the book was assembled

4937.94 --> 4944.5
it's proven that is an assembled book

4940.78 --> 4944.5
and reassembled

4949.89 --> 4953.039000000001
[Music]

4964.28 --> 4968.0
get the [ __ ] out of here Mr Ford it's

4966.5 --> 4970.52
the dumbest thing I've ever heard of

4968.0 --> 4972.92
troll say

4970.52 --> 4974.4800000000005
are no dinosaurs they're fictional

4972.92 --> 4976.159
constructs

4974.48 --> 4979.4
they don't exist

4976.159 --> 4982.159
they were assembled in workshops in the

4979.4 --> 4984.44
19th century

4982.159 --> 4988.42
but mostly made by chicken bones and

4984.44 --> 4988.419999999999
whale bones big bones put together

4988.639 --> 4993.04
and they just planted them

4993.679 --> 4998.38
and then make a media spectacle out of

4996.26 --> 4998.38
it

5000.58 --> 5006.639
dinosaurs are fake never existed

5004.3 --> 5009.219
Big Bang never exists it was thought up

5006.639 --> 5011.7390000000005
in the freaking 20th century by a Jesuit

5009.219 --> 5012.94
priest for crying out loud

5011.739 --> 5015.459999999999
yeah

5012.94 --> 5019.44
Earth is not a ball it's flat It's

5015.46 --> 5019.44
contained it's a limited space

5023.199 --> 5029.5599999999995
and it can only have manifested the way

5026.679 --> 5033.4
it has because it has to be designed

5029.56 --> 5035.56
things cannot come out of nothing

5033.4 --> 5038.259999999999
that's a logically

5035.56 --> 5042.1
is a logical dead end to assume such

5038.26 --> 5044.8
things as always is it always will be

5042.1 --> 5048.659000000001
because you can't prove that

5044.8 --> 5048.659000000001
things don't just come out of nothing

5052.9 --> 5055.32
right

5056.38 --> 5062.02
yeah and hey the Bible the book yeah it

5059.86 --> 5064.299999999999
was written by man

5062.02 --> 5067.719
and it was inspired

5064.3 --> 5071.38
by man to assemble it

5067.719 --> 5074.38
but there was a Jesus figure and his

5071.38 --> 5077.08
wisdom was incredible

5074.38 --> 5080.08
and it changed like

5077.08 --> 5082.179
the spirit realm itself

5080.08 --> 5084.699
it changed everything

5082.179 --> 5086.7390000000005
it brought a light in that was just not

5084.699 --> 5089.08
there before that time

5086.739 --> 5090.638999999999
and I he might not even been the only

5089.08 --> 5093.34
one I think that a whole bunch of

5090.639 --> 5095.139
ascended masters stood up

5093.34 --> 5098.02
over time

5095.139 --> 5103.26
and I do personally kind of favor him I

5098.02 --> 5103.26
think he is like the most pure in a way

5105.94 --> 5111.5199999999995
how did gum come it doesn't say God

5108.88 --> 5112.719
comes from nothing it's not addressed we

5111.52 --> 5115.2390000000005
don't know

5112.719 --> 5117.1
what God is outside of the Physical

5115.239 --> 5118.9
Realm even though he is outside of the

5117.1 --> 5121.42
Physical Realm

5118.9 --> 5123.099999999999
we don't know what is there we don't

5121.42 --> 5124.2390000000005
know what is in the other dimensions

5123.1 --> 5126.84
that's

5124.239 --> 5126.839999999999
so

5129.1 --> 5135.219
nobody says God comes from nothing

5132.639 --> 5138.04
that's not even said in the Bible it's

5135.219 --> 5142.78
just no God is just there

5138.04 --> 5145.659
nobody knows how long where how

5142.78 --> 5149.4
he is there he did not come from nothing

5145.659 --> 5149.4
that's said nowhere

5161.219 --> 5166.179
yeah dude if you're gonna have to be a

5164.08 --> 5168.82
little bit specific for talking about

5166.179 --> 5172.36
God and the origin and all that little G

5168.82 --> 5175.799999999999
God yeah little G gods were probably

5172.36 --> 5175.799999999999
created by God as well

5176.139 --> 5182.62
there's been a lot of things created the

5179.98 --> 5185.199
design potential is unlimited there

5182.62 --> 5188.32
could have been incredible things

5185.199 --> 5191.678999999999
and everything we just get to hear about

5188.32 --> 5194.259999999999
is what is remains

5191.679 --> 5197.5
after all the attrition after all the

5194.26 --> 5200.4400000000005
darkness have has basically destroyed a

5197.5 --> 5203.139
whole bunch of what God designed

5200.44 --> 5205.178999999999
and we are just here sitting on the

5203.139 --> 5207.719
remnants trying to figure out what was

5205.179 --> 5207.719
really there

5218.29 --> 5221.34
[Music]

5223.96 --> 5230.08
do

5226.54 --> 5233.28
do Stephen Hawkins died in the freaking

5230.08 --> 5233.28
90s you dumbass

5233.739 --> 5238.178999999999
the guide have been rolling around in a

5235.9 --> 5240.4
wheelchair for over a decade in the 21st

5238.179 --> 5241.78
century that's not the same guy he

5240.4 --> 5243.46
doesn't even have the same freaking

5241.78 --> 5247.3
teeth

5243.46 --> 5249.159
it's just a a freak Show we'll pop it oh

5247.3 --> 5250.900000000001
by the way uh before I round out the

5249.159 --> 5253.12
show

5250.9 --> 5257.0199999999995
I'm starting to watch

5253.12 --> 5260.5599999999995
the latest season of stranger things

5257.02 --> 5263.8
and I was really freaking hilarious

5260.56 --> 5266.56
Define that in class somebody made a

5263.8 --> 5268.96
priest like the [ __ ] in that scenario

5266.56 --> 5272.88
made a presentation about Helen Keller

5268.96 --> 5272.88
and I laughed my freaking ass off

5272.98 --> 5276.659
that's so freaking funny

5278.44 --> 5284.5
that was so hilarious

5281.139 --> 5287.38
like these guys have been paying

5284.5 --> 5290.44
attention the writers of of the stranger

5287.38 --> 5294.34
things they they have looked around and

5290.44 --> 5296.5599999999995
they it's really funny and Promises

5294.34 --> 5298.84
I don't know I think that I think they

5296.56 --> 5301.26
might have learned a bit about their

5298.84 --> 5301.26
lesson

5302.62 --> 5309.239
to not go all full sgaw

5305.679 --> 5309.2390000000005
