so yeah today is a beautiful day it was

73.619 --> 85.40899999999999
actually so good then in a in an unusual

82.32 --> 88.38
maneuver I did my newspaper rounds the

85.409 --> 90.93
in the morning and it was really nice it

88.38 --> 93.27
was exactly this type of weather nice

90.93 --> 95.25
and sunny a little bit windy a bit

93.27 --> 97.1
annoying sometimes when you're trying to

95.25 --> 103.17
haul around papers and getting blowed

97.1 --> 107.97
you know directions but yeah beautiful

103.17 --> 112.59
day and they got the whole evening to

107.97 --> 116.31
myself for if I would like to get on

112.59 --> 119.19
some other panel and go berserk on the

116.31 --> 124.35
people that are acting like total demons

119.19 --> 126.99
like what happened yesterday that's most

124.35 --> 133.07999999999998
of you and especially a GM definitely

126.99 --> 135.959
knows so let's see you in chat ok a GM

133.08 --> 140.34
was first usually is first these days

135.959 --> 146.54
Steve a Monday you was good to see you

140.34 --> 150.629
righteous force leb I killed the hope

146.54 --> 157.43
yeah good to see you let's see how's my

150.629 --> 157.42999999999998
sound doing right should be normal

158.94 --> 165.25
[Music]

160.39 --> 168.26
so yeah yesterday was it was kind of odd

165.25 --> 171.41
the Hangout itself that I had yesterday

168.26 --> 173.89999999999998
I did I wasn't all that inspired that

171.41 --> 178.25
just didn't really happen too much

173.9 --> 183.26
and I was like I needed some more time

178.25 --> 185.3
to yeah I don't know I would my energy

183.26 --> 188.35999999999999
wasn't prepared properly somehow it

185.3 --> 196.31
didn't really work but today hopefully

188.36 --> 198.92000000000002
it's going to go a little bit better I'm

196.31 --> 204.14000000000001
still hoping to get Brendon although now

198.92 --> 207.89
all of a sudden it seems to be

204.14 --> 211.1
impossible to catch her maybe she's just

207.89 --> 213.70999999999998
sleeping late these days what would

211.1 --> 221.6
explain why she did get on Jose's much

213.71 --> 224.93
later right also I just got a little

221.6 --> 229.78
call over Skype right before the show

224.93 --> 234.74
started by Nathan and Randy because whoa

229.78 --> 236.45
seems that I have Randy band and Nathan

234.74 --> 238.76000000000002
was trying to ask me if I could please

236.45 --> 247.16
unban him same team and all that and

238.76 --> 250.85
then I basically said like why should I

247.16 --> 257.6
do that because Randy has been kind of a

250.85 --> 259.64
dick in many ways and Nathan actually

257.6 --> 262.46000000000004
tried to make him apologize let's just

259.64 --> 266.63
throw that out there it does definitely

262.46 --> 268.28
try but it's Randy couldn't do it he

266.63 --> 271.85
actually said that he prefer being

268.28 --> 274.94
banned so yeah and that's exactly the

271.85 --> 278.18
problem cuz you know come on

274.94 --> 281.63
Randy's like that I know but at the same

278.18 --> 283.88
time our one is also like that in the

281.63 --> 284.57
sense that I am very tolerant but I have

283.88 --> 290.29
my limits

284.57 --> 295.45
especially to those who are unrepentant

290.29 --> 297.73
and to their bad behaviors and that's

295.45 --> 300.34
the problem here that's been a problem

297.73 --> 306.0
for a long time and it managed to work

300.34 --> 306.0
somehow but it doesn't do that anymore

309.42 --> 319.90000000000003
so yeah not so much the same team no no

313.89 --> 322.2
you know used to be not not so much

319.9 --> 322.2
anymore

330.05 --> 334.819
but I did offer them both sigh get on my

332.9 --> 340.87
show and talk about it if they wanted to

334.819 --> 340.87
but they declined not surprisingly

350.79 --> 357.99
yeah yeah the whole situation you know

355.62 --> 361.89
what it is this kind of a thing

357.99 --> 369.72
I felt really weird about it afterward

361.89 --> 372.06
because I was going full-on yeah

369.72 --> 375.27000000000004
basically saying yeah you're you're a

372.06 --> 378.24
[ __ ] your act did the way you act would

375.27 --> 380.13
you attack everyone your total egomaniac

378.24 --> 383.73
you know no honor everything you say is

380.13 --> 386.64
like a Viper bite just the way it just

383.73 --> 389.49
sounds the guy is just totally repulsive

386.64 --> 394.02
I don't get how he allows himself to be

389.49 --> 396.33
like this can't understand it and well

394.02 --> 398.82
that's normal for him so that's why I

396.33 --> 402.45
eventually unsub Candle Ike wanted the

398.82 --> 404.49
study meant first Tim Osman and watch

402.45 --> 408.45
this channel but what's just boring [ __ ]

404.49 --> 412.08
playing stupid music and just whining

408.45 --> 414.03
all the time it was [ __ ] so I couldn't

412.08 --> 415.62
stand it anymore not even to try and

414.03 --> 418.46999999999997
keep tabs on what they were talking

415.62 --> 422.22
about just so I unsubscribe done bailed

418.47 --> 424.92
and everything and but the band bump

422.22 --> 428.55
into him and I've been trying to like

424.92 --> 432.24
contact Brenda for a while and just like

428.55 --> 433.14
wanted her to have a little room to just

432.24 --> 435.24
talk about it

433.14 --> 438.47999999999996
what happened because I'd I feel like

435.24 --> 445.14
people aren't giving her that like none

438.48 --> 447.45000000000005
at all and being very brutal with her

445.14 --> 449.4
and yeah you could say okay well yeah

447.45 --> 453.87
she's been the total idiot and she's a

449.4 --> 457.77
drone and she kind of deserves some yeah

453.87 --> 463.17
slapping face metaphorically but this

457.77 --> 467.21999999999997
just seems just wrong it just feels

463.17 --> 469.11
wrong what they're doing and yeah it

467.22 --> 471.03000000000003
just feels wrong to me and I have though

469.11 --> 473.55
I don't know call it a white night urge

471.03 --> 475.79999999999995
to kind of defend her or something even

473.55 --> 478.86
though I don't have huge amounts of

475.8 --> 480.90000000000003
respect for her but just you gotta you

478.86 --> 482.88
gotta fight off the bad behavior no

480.9 --> 483.92999999999995
matter who it's targeted at if it's for

482.88 --> 484.35
the wrong reasons

483.93 --> 485.97
it's

484.35 --> 492.15000000000003
the wrong reasons it doesn't matter who

485.97 --> 496.88000000000005
it is and oh hello Randy exclamation

492.15 --> 496.88
mark alright

501.13 --> 512.8
what the [ __ ] all right goodbye anyway

509.4 --> 517.4789999999999
yeah I got on there I've watched the lil

512.8 --> 522.13
and I just noticed that Tim was not only

517.479 --> 526.36
just [ __ ] over Brenda because yeah

522.13 --> 530.59
obvious reasons but even then suggesting

526.36 --> 534.07
just horrific things like a psychopath

530.59 --> 536.94
like somebody who doesn't understand the

534.07 --> 540.1
actual energy of the words they're using

536.94 --> 544.4200000000001
because they are desensitized he

540.1 --> 547.48
literally said like yeah she she could

544.42 --> 556.77
have probably epstein herself like oh my

547.48 --> 560.47
god like what is wrong with you two

556.77 --> 565.09
to rob a situation like that off on to

560.47 --> 571.5
Brenda on to anyone really that is so

565.09 --> 574.39
repulsive it it's it's

571.5 --> 575.35
multi-dimensionally disgusting because

574.39 --> 578.1999999999999
of who the guy is

575.35 --> 580.5400000000001
of course what happened to him is very

578.2 --> 584.26
dubious but it's basically yeah he's

580.54 --> 587.5
suicide like how could you talk about

584.26 --> 589.72
other people like that like I never do

587.5 --> 592.75
that even though sometimes in a rage I

589.72 --> 594.82
might be inclined to kind of like just

592.75 --> 597.76
to make somebody shut up but I always

594.82 --> 602.44
try to avoid that because it's just pure

597.76 --> 607.06
wrong and he would like say that [ __ ] in

602.44 --> 611.5
the group like it was a joke that is so

607.06 --> 614.29
repulsive I just that that really made

611.5 --> 618.51
me turn me to rage win and just the guy

614.29 --> 621.0699999999999
needed punishment big time relentless

618.51 --> 625.97
he's just lucky there was the internet

621.07 --> 628.07
between us because yeah

625.97 --> 630.1700000000001
you know what probably would have

628.07 --> 637.7
happened I was really pissed off at the

630.17 --> 640.1899999999999
guy and I do think I did get to him a

637.7 --> 645.5600000000001
little but he'll never show it it's just

640.19 --> 648.5
gonna now yes uh Vanya rage retro rage

645.56 --> 652.2199999999999
respond to to that situation and try to

648.5 --> 654.68
shame me as much as possible and I don't

652.22 --> 656.15
really care or maybe he really got to

654.68 --> 660.02
him he's just gonna shut up and stay

656.15 --> 669.86
away but I kind of doubt it anyway hello

because you know how Randy gets when

1143.19 --> 1148.44
people try to make him apologize

1145.32 --> 1151.08
his Savannah a complex starts working up

1148.44 --> 1154.3490000000002
and then he turns into a really nasty

1151.08 --> 1157.83
troll on the same level of some of these

1154.349 --> 1162.6899999999998
other people at this distinct type of

1157.83 --> 1165.529
behavior that's why I called him that so

curious to hear because every time I do

1416.5 --> 1422.08
that it's it feels like yeah it needs to

1419.29 --> 1424.36
be done it's true but then at the same

1422.08 --> 1430.36
time afterward happened like this weird

1424.36 --> 1433.4699999999998
feeling like like there's like this

1430.36 --> 1437.4599999999998
these dark eyes looking on it's weird

1433.47 --> 1440.23
there's definitely a whole swath of very

1437.46 --> 1442.54
repulsive people that are gonna take

1440.23 --> 1444.49
notice of that kind of [ __ ] and they're

1442.54 --> 1453.6399999999999
gonna try to use it against me at some

1444.49 --> 1458.43
point I think but yeah I sometimes just

1453.64 --> 1461.7700000000002
need to I have so much frustration of

1458.43 --> 1465.8400000000001
all the people that are on the scene

1461.77 --> 1473.61
that I get caught up mingling in between

1465.84 --> 1473.61
that I'm just so disappointed at them

1478.39 --> 1486.92
and yeah they yeah I've had some how do

1483.71 --> 1490.1000000000001
you say some financial stress situations

1486.92 --> 1492.23
and then yeah at some point

1490.1 --> 1495.8899999999999
combine that with beer in the evening

1492.23 --> 1497.66
and because I definitely did have some

1495.89 --> 1502.3400000000001
beers I don't think I'd ever have gone

1497.66 --> 1504.77
all out like that if I hadn't but I

1502.34 --> 1507.4099999999999
wanted to anyway because I'm just so

1504.77 --> 1512.48
freaking frustrated about all these

1507.41 --> 1515.3300000000002
horrible people among us that literally

1512.48 --> 1517.76
infect the people with their presence

1515.33 --> 1520.28
and I sometimes think they don't even

1517.76 --> 1522.44
notice it they just let it happen and it

1520.28 --> 1531.23
smears off on them and then everything

1522.44 --> 1533.65
is ruined and I really just get him out

1531.23 --> 1533.65
of here

1540.35 --> 1545.899
all right well cept a piece ank's for

1542.6 --> 1550.6299999999999
the comment yeah there's always people

1545.899 --> 1550.6299999999999
looking for you to feel I know I know

1552.13 --> 1556.8400000000001
that's why I usually don't really

1554.63 --> 1574.7
respond to that at all

1556.84 --> 1577.639
what a Jason Jason dispray Lou I don't

1574.7 --> 1580.45
ban Nathan monk Lido he's like one of my

1577.639 --> 1580.4499999999998
favorite trolls

1592.95 --> 1600.27
I don't know he just I I think it's just

1597.57 --> 1602.31
really funny now it's good it's good

1600.27 --> 1606.21
I was just being like oh no no don't ban

1602.31 --> 1610.53
this guy because yeah time out here what

1606.21 --> 1614.31
is this another sock god how many of

1610.53 --> 1631.29
these sock cards do you have and nobody

1614.31 --> 1635.31
banned you all right oh I think Jason

1631.29 --> 1638.09
this furry is what probably yeah he is

1635.31 --> 1645.11
from the globe light tour bus it

1638.09 --> 1645.11
advertising so I that's interesting I

1646.01 --> 1651.3799999999999
wonder what they have in mind that's

1648.69 --> 1651.38
kind of interesting

1662.55 --> 1668.49
yeah guys it's no use timing him out he

1665.76 --> 1677.91
probably has like 20 shotguns just let

1668.49 --> 1681.8700000000001
him be his silly self if it gets too bad

1677.91 --> 1695.22
I'll just slow down I'll just put it to

1681.87 --> 1697.8799999999999
slow mode now he gleen yeah sorry mister

1695.22 --> 1697.88
coming earlier

1706.07 --> 1708.73
huh

1712.96 --> 1719.17
the Oki I don't know exactly what you

1717.28 --> 1726.12
mean by that but it sounds very

1719.17 --> 1726.1200000000001
interesting gleam let me see if I can

1739.83 --> 1750.12
what holy [ __ ] really

1746.04 --> 1751.43
that's Wow thanks for that that's

1750.12 --> 1756.36
fascinating I uh

1751.43 --> 1760.47
I'm not there yet though but thanks for

1756.36 --> 1764.4599999999998
the update so am I getting this right

1760.47 --> 1766.83
that electron seems to have the same

1764.46 --> 1770.6100000000001
kind of weird slowing down speeding up

1766.83 --> 1772.1699999999998
effect as light has in in its own way is

1770.61 --> 1774.4099999999999
that what you're saying that is really

1772.17 --> 1774.41
fascinating

1786.76 --> 1791.92
yeah how would you approach that then

1789.09 --> 1796.2099999999998
then it's almost like there really is

1791.92 --> 1801.7
this medium it kind of plays into the

1796.21 --> 1802.95
ether concept if you ask me but then the

1801.7 --> 1805.69
ether would kind of have that

1802.95 --> 1808.15
stabilizing effect all not just light

1805.69 --> 1811.6200000000001
one on electron on electrics as well and

1808.15 --> 1816.88
I'm pretty pretty much any type of yeah

1811.62 --> 1820.87
non material based energies could that

1816.88 --> 1826.7700000000002
be correct this is all new to me by the

1820.87 --> 1826.77
way well I haven't even considered it

1830.82 --> 1834.01
[Music]

1837.909 --> 1844.8690000000001
Wow huh

1851.59 --> 1872.7099999999998
what gleam you're blowing my mind dude

1856.559 --> 1876.46
or are you a dude yeah damn yeah if you

1872.71 --> 1878.169
got some more direct reference to what

1876.46 --> 1884.44
you're talking about I'd love to look

1878.169 --> 1889.169
into that or like add me on skype and

1884.44 --> 1891.94
I'll add you in my early bird room with

1889.169 --> 1894.1000000000001
ya dejan is also in there I'd love to

1891.94 --> 1897.179
hear more about this maybe just my chat

1894.1 --> 1897.1789999999999
is a little tough

1909.97 --> 1914.92
that is fascinating but

1920.38 --> 1922.919
right

1922.95 --> 1929.8500000000001
ah look it's getting a little bit too

1926.22 --> 1932.009
convoluted now so I may yeah you're

1929.85 --> 1934.019
trying to compact all that information

1932.009 --> 1936.57
in just a couple of sentences it's a

1934.019 --> 1939.57
little bit tough to make sure that I'm

1936.57 --> 1943.32
not mistaking interpreting things but

1939.57 --> 1947.82
are you saying that like the way

1943.32 --> 1949.98
electrics flow like electric connection

1947.82 --> 1954.83
or what would have an electric field

1949.98 --> 1962.759
when you shoot like a laser through it

1954.83 --> 1967.499
that it the the light slows down it kind

1962.759 --> 1971.73
of like bends it a little as if slowing

1967.499 --> 1974.6390000000001
down just like it medium transit of a

1971.73 --> 1977.279
laser through glass and everything and

1974.639 --> 1979.639
then again would also slow down in that

1977.279 --> 1979.639
sense

1987.01 --> 1994.81
[ __ ] on drag that's fascinating

1990.6 --> 1996.8799999999999
well I think I got it right then it's

1994.81 --> 2001.6799999999998
fatty this is really interesting and

1996.88 --> 2005.15
weird also I think around yeah mm in the

2001.68 --> 2008.4
times of 2008 I had contact with some

2005.15 --> 2010.8300000000002
weird basement-dwelling American guy who

2008.4 --> 2014.52
was heavily into physics and high-tech

2010.83 --> 2017.8799999999999
[ __ ] he was a bit of a creeper but he

2014.52 --> 2022.05
was heavily studying the effect that

2017.88 --> 2024.75
this kind of effect of how lights can

2022.05 --> 2027.3
influence electricity and we had all

2024.75 --> 2028.23
kinds of weird high-tech weapon ideas

2027.3 --> 2030.6299999999999
with that [ __ ]

2028.23 --> 2038.94
we're totally science fiction the crap

2030.63 --> 2045.63
out of things so it's interesting to to

2038.94 --> 2048.659
hear about that again right so gleam

2045.63 --> 2055.9500000000003
thanks for all the info but please just

2048.659 --> 2058.98
post a link and also if you can add me

2055.95 --> 2061.4089999999997
on skype and I'll just add you in the

2058.98 --> 2063.33
room so you could elaborate some more

2061.409 --> 2065.78
about this because I really find this

2063.33 --> 2065.7799999999997
very interesting

2071.16 --> 2079.64
try it but you tried three times okay

2079.88 --> 2086.55
well did you try the right address

2083.24 --> 2089.3999999999996
because I have another old account and

2086.55 --> 2099.42
that's the wrong one you you need to use

2089.4 --> 2100.92
our win with Y and not IJ and seven now

2099.42 --> 2103.5
gleam you don't have to come with me

2100.92 --> 2106.86
live on the show I just want you in the

2103.5 --> 2108.66
chat room so you could give out links

2106.86 --> 2118.8
and everything I want to talk some more

2108.66 --> 2120.6
about this after the show - hmm you know

2118.8 --> 2132.42
what screw it I'm gonna give you a

2120.6 --> 2134.91
wrench your input is thus valuable yeah

2132.42 --> 2137.66
thanks uber McCool if that is the one

2134.91 --> 2137.66
let's see

2151.75 --> 2161.17
hmm okay hey I found you Lou

2185.35 --> 2194.15
there we go

2188.35 --> 2197.66
welcome to the early Burchette ah yeah

2194.15 --> 2202.76
you got the same link right let's see if

2197.66 --> 2206.47
I can present it yeah for the record I

2202.76 --> 2206.4700000000003
haven't really read it or anything

2208.96 --> 2211.96
wait

2228.91 --> 2233.6499999999996
all right that's more like it okay here

2232.809 --> 2241.529
it goes

2233.65 --> 2241.529
there we go so as the website

2242.67 --> 2247.9
researchers find electron current

2245.559 --> 2251.7000000000003
direction in photo drag effect is

2247.9 --> 2251.7000000000003
dependent on surrounding environment

2263.69 --> 2267.82
waitwhat

2264.63 --> 2267.82
[Music]

2280.97 --> 2287.75
okay I'm just gonna read this past

2285.26 --> 2290.599
research efforts have shown that when

2287.75 --> 2297.619
photons strike and metal at an angle

2290.599 --> 2300.17
their momentum is conserved what as it

2297.619 --> 2304.579
is given to free electrons from the

2300.17 --> 2305.589
metal surface the momentum that doesn't

2304.579 --> 2309.13
make any sense

2305.589 --> 2309.13
hold on by the way

2337.099 --> 2342.119
alright okay so well yeah the whole

2340.319 --> 2343.68
momentum seems kind of ridiculous

2342.119 --> 2346.589
because I don't think that light has

2343.68 --> 2350.39
mass or let me rephrase that I'm

2346.589 --> 2354.24
absolutely sure there is no mass

2350.39 --> 2357.71
involved in light what so ever so that's

2354.24 --> 2361.859
already kind of a bit of a bump but

2357.71 --> 2363.869
let's continue momentum is conserved as

2361.859 --> 2366.0589999999997
it is given free electrons from the

2363.869 --> 2368.01
metal surface this results in free

2366.059 --> 2372.809
electrons being pushed forward creating

2368.01 --> 2375.63
an electric current right so there's

2372.809 --> 2377.6400000000003
basically as light bumps off there is

2375.63 --> 2386.0
electrons released because of the energy

2377.64 --> 2390.72
and it being pushed forward as in I

2386.0 --> 2394.26
really get it creating an electric

2390.72 --> 2396.8999999999996
current yeah where is it creating an

2394.26 --> 2401.0
electric current in the metal or is it

2396.9 --> 2405.38
like charging up like a electric field

2401.0 --> 2405.38
what is it exactly I don't get it

2408.109 --> 2414.2889999999998
anyway the photoelectric effect it has

2412.4 --> 2416.779
been put to use in many modern

2414.289 --> 2418.9990000000003
applications I'm sure it is recently

2416.779 --> 2421.16
research has shown that electrons in

2418.999 --> 2423.4399999999996
such situation do not always flow as

2421.16 --> 2426.019
expected okay to find out why the

2423.44 --> 2429.739
research is carried out some very simple

2426.019 --> 2434.4399999999996
experiments which I wonder if they're

2429.739 --> 2437.93
really but first experiment consisted of

2434.44 --> 2438.619
setting up gold film inside of a vacuum

2437.93 --> 2442.249
chamber

2438.619 --> 2442.759
it's an electrode attached to it at one

2442.249 --> 2445.069
end

2442.759 --> 2446.959
researchers fired polarized light at the

2445.069 --> 2451.64
film and an angle to read voltage

2446.959 --> 2454.609
readings of the electron how did that

2451.64 --> 2456.8289999999997
current began flowing in the metal just

2454.609 --> 2460.94
as theories regarding the photoelectric

2456.829 --> 2462.469
drag photo dragon effect suggests that

2460.94 --> 2472.42
there was a problem however the current

2462.469 --> 2472.42
flowed in the wrong direction I

2472.49 --> 2478.91
how does that make any sense I what do

2476.45 --> 2481.16
they mean with that where was it

2478.91 --> 2486.29
established the electrons went into a

2481.16 --> 2491.98
direction that I might just be totally

2486.29 --> 2491.98
not getting this what do you guys think

2495.16 --> 2501.44
current flowed in the wrong direction so

2498.58 --> 2505.8199999999997
does that mean that like in an electric

2501.44 --> 2508.39
circuit sadly it is reversed is that

2505.82 --> 2508.3900000000003
what they mean

2513.27 --> 2519.119
all right so yeah slightly confused by

2516.18 --> 2520.83
the results as am i the researcher set

2519.119 --> 2522.81
up the same apparatus in a non vacuum

2520.83 --> 2526.31
environment and ran the experiment again

2522.81 --> 2531.75
this time the voltage flowed forward

2526.31 --> 2539.88
prior research had shown it would okay

2531.75 --> 2542.46
wait all right so what they're

2539.88 --> 2546.53
suggesting is that if there is normal

2542.46 --> 2549.36
air pressure then everything works

2546.53 --> 2552.38
predictably normally but if they're

2549.36 --> 2556.29
super low pressure then apparently that

2552.38 --> 2561.57
changes the way the charge functions and

2556.29 --> 2564.48
reverses it well there yeah it would be

2561.57 --> 2567.77
to me yet another weird side effect of

2564.48 --> 2570.09
highly different different pressures

2567.77 --> 2574.92
different pressures seem to have all

2570.09 --> 2577.38
these kinds of insane wide effects on on

2574.92 --> 2582.02
effect on young electrics and all that

2577.38 --> 2582.02
so in that it doesn't surprise me at all

2589.21 --> 2595.809
oh wait Deb okay thanks gleam sorry I

2594.069 --> 2596.38
haven't read it I've been just looking

2595.809 --> 2600.52
into this

2596.38 --> 2602.859
but yeah gleam says it's to do with the

2600.52 --> 2606.099
potential differences they were

2602.859 --> 2608.589
expecting an attraction to the metal and

2606.099 --> 2610.6600000000003
repelled it okay is that descriptor e

2608.589 --> 2614.349
because I'm pretty sure it had nothing

2610.66 --> 2617.22
to do with magnetic attraction it seems

2614.349 --> 2622.5
like a reverse charge the like a

2617.22 --> 2622.5
polarized opposite switch is that it

2623.91 --> 2630.99
medium has electric in it so there's a

2626.559 --> 2630.9900000000002
charge that's what I thought

2635.08 --> 2640.9
yeah September I I'm literally

2638.77 --> 2643.03
improvising here it would be much better

2640.9 --> 2645.46
if we just had a conversation and

2643.03 --> 2653.53
somebody like gleam could literally

2645.46 --> 2659.95
explain it anyway let me try to continue

2653.53 --> 2661.86
reading research researchers suggesting

2659.95 --> 2664.5699999999997
their findings show that electron flow

2661.86 --> 2666.25
direction from photon dragon facts is

2664.57 --> 2669.1600000000003
wholly dependent on the environment

2666.25 --> 2671.68
around the metal freely acknowledged

2669.16 --> 2674.77
that they do not know why the electrons

2671.68 --> 2676.4199999999996
flow backwards but hazard as I guess the

2674.77 --> 2678.82
flow direction may be impacted by the

2676.42 --> 2681.79
core electrons that are bound to metal

2678.82 --> 2684.34
ions they also know that their findings

2681.79 --> 2685.7799999999997
will have to be more fully explored

2684.34 --> 2688.57
because their observations have

2685.78 --> 2690.1600000000003
demonstrated that there are still gaps

2688.57 --> 2694.3
in understanding how light and metals

2690.16 --> 2697.95
interact well I might have a small

2694.3 --> 2705.36
suggestion as a as a layman outsider and

2697.95 --> 2708.8799999999997
say that well electric charge it's like

2705.36 --> 2710.86
everything it always has to do with

2708.88 --> 2713.86
conductivity so it seems only logical

2710.86 --> 2716.76
that if there is a lack of material that

2713.86 --> 2718.65
it will influence the way the charge

2716.76 --> 2722.4700000000003
manifests because it is like a

2718.65 --> 2724.78
manifestation in comparison to when

2722.47 --> 2730.0299999999997
there is just full out medium to

2724.78 --> 2732.78
transfer through so maybe there is kind

2730.03 --> 2734.8900000000003
of like a weird feedback loop effect

2732.78 --> 2739.8
electrically going on something like

2734.89 --> 2742.7999999999997
that just being I'm improvising it

2739.8 --> 2742.8
anyway

2745.67 --> 2755.46
[Music]

2748.68 --> 2765.5
Yeah right oh that's it oh right yeah

2755.46 --> 2765.5
still interesting thank you for that

2783.05 --> 2788.119
now gleam but that's the thing your

2785.63 --> 2790.46
description direct magnetism into it

2788.119 --> 2793.1000000000004
sort of the way you when you're talking

2790.46 --> 2796.94
about attraction and repelling that is

2793.1 --> 2800.6
very much magnetism related but it

2796.94 --> 2804.56
doesn't seem to be like that at all just

2800.6 --> 2807.5899999999997
has to do with how charge comes into

2804.56 --> 2810.41
being like how does the energy manifest

2807.59 --> 2813.9700000000003
and in this case they're studying it how

2810.41 --> 2818.1499999999996
does it manifest when yeah when the room

2813.97 --> 2821.2999999999997
to which the charge can manifest through

2818.15 --> 2823.369
is altered by all the material not being

2821.3 --> 2825.17
there anymore and apparently it then

2823.369 --> 2829.1000000000004
manifests in a different way is

2825.17 --> 2831.58
fascinating the nature of electric

2829.1 --> 2831.58
charges

2838.77 --> 2842.369
oh cool the one says he's gonna do this

2841.619 --> 2846.4500000000003
experiment

2842.369 --> 2850.4
Wow I hope you film that we got to see

2846.45 --> 2850.3999999999996
that stuff that's awesome

2859.97 --> 2865.85
all right well I'm glad you agree to

2862.52 --> 2867.74
that clean that photons is massless and

2865.85 --> 2870.52
every time they say things like momentum

2867.74 --> 2878.1499999999996
I'm suggests a Oh God

2870.52 --> 2880.7599999999998
because yeah pretty sure that momentum

2878.15 --> 2882.9500000000003
is actually part of the Newtonian

2880.76 --> 2885.6200000000003
concept that applies to matter to all

2882.95 --> 2890.0
things with mass so it doesn't really

2885.62 --> 2892.64
apply it's just it's another effect it's

2890.0 --> 2895.25
not momentum but momentum I guess is

2892.64 --> 2897.62
more descriptor II so people will kind

2895.25 --> 2906.5
of get through the script eerie

2897.62 --> 2910.31
direction of what they're explaining the

2906.5 --> 2916.43
what well okay gleam says he believes

2910.31 --> 2917.15
more in the perturbation theory never

2916.43 --> 2920.4199999999996
heard of it

2917.15 --> 2932.7290000000003
I'm gonna Google that right now

2920.42 --> 2932.7290000000003
[Music]

2935.24 --> 2938.24
okay

2942.76 --> 2949.4700000000003
all right yeah I kind of agree

2947.1 --> 2951.609
perturbation theory comprises

2949.47 --> 2953.859
mathematical methods for finding an

2951.609 --> 2955.84
approximate solution to a problem by

2953.859 --> 2959.2599999999998
starting from the exact solution of a

2955.84 --> 2962.8900000000003
related simpler problem yeah it's a very

2959.26 --> 2965.19
workable result yielding method in

2962.89 --> 2968.6189999999997
general it's what I kind of do as well

2965.19 --> 2970.2400000000002
uh yeah I'll share it it's just I've

2968.619 --> 2974.4700000000003
just found some wiki it's not that

2970.24 --> 2986.3399999999997
interesting really but yeah perturbation

2974.47 --> 2986.3399999999997
theory what are you talking about

2996.29 --> 3008.75
alright you think that the drag effect

2999.599 --> 3010.88
is the ether well can't say yet as I

3008.75 --> 3014.24
explained before ether may be one of

3010.88 --> 3016.73
these things that is like a like a lost

3014.24 --> 3020.93
aberration that people regularly don't

3016.73 --> 3025.22
even get to that point - I'm pretty sure

3020.93 --> 3027.71
that Tesla completely understood it of

3025.22 --> 3030.5
course he did he knew what it was and

3027.71 --> 3034.51
what it wasn't I I'm not sure yet I just

3030.5 --> 3036.68
feel so much like an aberration like him

3034.51 --> 3039.1600000000003
something you would have to assume to be

3036.68 --> 3042.6499999999996
there just like the concept of gravity

3039.16 --> 3045.3489999999997
except this one rests on just the

3042.65 --> 3048.349
general misunderstanding of what it

3045.349 --> 3051.349
actually is they're studying it's just

3048.349 --> 3052.76
that's when you get the wrong angle to

3051.349 --> 3055.76
the whole thing that's when the

3052.76 --> 3058.73
aberrations start to become this this

3055.76 --> 3060.44
cornerstone of the whole thing that's

3058.73 --> 3061.19
how you kind of figure out that you're

3060.44 --> 3064.54
on the wrong track

3061.19 --> 3071.33
because aberrations start to pop up and

3064.54 --> 3073.82
it could be this but until I actually

3071.33 --> 3078.38
fully understand to get to that level

3073.82 --> 3080.9
this is just a future suspicion that I

3078.38 --> 3083.9300000000003
can perfectly confirm I'm just saying it

3080.9 --> 3088.7000000000003
feels like an aberration it may turn out

3083.93 --> 3090.7599999999998
to be one but I can't be sure at this

3088.7 --> 3090.7599999999998
point

3093.1 --> 3100.87
just warning you may turn out to be one

3096.12 --> 3104.5299999999997
and that doesn't mean that everything

3100.87 --> 3108.0099999999998
that the ether theory attributes to it

3104.53 --> 3111.4300000000003
is not necessarily like oh that doesn't

3108.01 --> 3115.1200000000003
exist at all no just saying that it

3111.43 --> 3118.5099999999998
could be simply the remnants of what is

3115.12 --> 3120.49
going on that are left over when the

3118.51 --> 3123.19
whole theory is constructed of what is

3120.49 --> 3125.4399999999996
going on and then it's like just like

3123.19 --> 3128.05
with gravity like ooh you have to assume

3125.44 --> 3131.55
that part or it's not gonna work despite

3128.05 --> 3134.88
that it's all things you can't really

3131.55 --> 3134.88
scientifically prove

3139.31 --> 3154.7599999999998
Oh Feeny TV is oh well wouldn't be

3142.73 --> 3157.16
surprised that guy is just yet nah I'm

3154.76 --> 3161.4500000000003
most inclined to just erase that because

3157.16 --> 3171.98
that guy is so repulsive he has been for

3161.45 --> 3174.95
a long time right yeah and that Amanda

3171.98 --> 3177.38
young is the reason why I'm not worried

3174.95 --> 3180.74
every time somebody starts to go on some

3177.38 --> 3186.2000000000003
kind of nasty rage rant about me and why

3180.74 --> 3190.1299999999997
I'm such a terrible person because what

3186.2 --> 3193.0
do they have really you know I'm pretty

3190.13 --> 3197.21
open and honest about all of my flaws I

3193.0 --> 3206.87
am trying to work on them as I go and I

3197.21 --> 3209.54
do contribute so yeah I'm not worried

3206.87 --> 3214.72
about it what's he gonna say that I'm a

3209.54 --> 3214.72
homophobe oh yeah yeah I am

3214.81 --> 3222.95
it's not like I'm doing that to be

3217.19 --> 3225.56
trendy or something it's just yeah but

3222.95 --> 3228.08
then I could use that on the other hand

3225.56 --> 3232.19
though I do have to transsexual friends

3228.08 --> 3235.18
and there's a lot of gay people that I

3232.19 --> 3239.27
really kind of like because they're not

3235.18 --> 3244.3999999999996
horrifying facts there just happened to

3239.27 --> 3246.23
be homosexual you know and that's I

3244.4 --> 3251.33
would never call those people dirty

3246.23 --> 3253.58
facts or just because they like yeah do

3251.33 --> 3255.71
you know what with their boyfriends or

3253.58 --> 3258.2599999999998
whatever that's their own business it's

3255.71 --> 3261.59
all about the behavior towards other and

3258.26 --> 3265.19
manipulate in all that [ __ ] that's what

3261.59 --> 3269.9500000000003
I'm attacking not the actual thing and I

3265.19 --> 3274.0
don't know any other way to describe it

3269.95 --> 3274.0
without watering it down

3277.0 --> 3286.48
all right anyway thanks for the there

3283.04 --> 3289.06
rumor updates it's good to hear that

3286.48 --> 3295.55
copyright strike

3289.06 --> 3298.85
that's hilarious mm-hmm I don't know do

3295.55 --> 3301.4500000000003
I have do I even have that capability to

3298.85 --> 3301.45
do that Oh

3306.61 --> 3310.04
anyway I I don't even want to look for

3309.29 --> 3315.32
his channel

3310.04 --> 3319.31
just let the gutter trolls just barf out

3315.32 --> 3320.53
all their diarrhea until they well drown

3319.31 --> 3323.24
in it

3320.53 --> 3329.98
then just let the rain wash it all away

3323.24 --> 3329.9799999999996
so they can start all over again yeah

3331.21 --> 3334.39
all right

3345.82 --> 3349.7690000000002
[Music]

3353.47 --> 3356.9599999999996
[Music]

3376.64 --> 3386.2799999999997
damnit I'm missing a good conversation

3379.26 --> 3388.9500000000003
in my chat now thank you truth seeker

3386.28 --> 3391.3500000000004
mafia indeed do

3388.95 --> 3392.9399999999996
yeah I'm not I'm gonna round out the

3391.35 --> 3395.64
show and not too long from now but I'm

3392.94 --> 3397.14
still want to continue this this

3395.64 --> 3399.47
conversation because I thought it was

3397.14 --> 3407.97
really good

3399.47 --> 3410.8999999999996
gleam asked dejan I think it was it

3407.97 --> 3410.8999999999996
where no wow

3411.17 --> 3415.67
argh I lost it

3425.049 --> 3431.38
but yet that somebody say that the ether

3428.429 --> 3435.279
would not be present in a vacuum and

3431.38 --> 3441.909
that would be what the photo drag effect

3435.279 --> 3448.119
would supposedly be proven well could be

3441.909 --> 3450.609
again I don't think at this point from

3448.119 --> 3454.38
first glance and from long term looking

3450.609 --> 3457.3289999999997
that the ether really is exactly like

3454.38 --> 3462.6690000000003
what it would have to be is basically a

3457.329 --> 3468.159
stabilizing field but that means that

3462.669 --> 3470.799
it's a setup of a thing that you can't

3468.159 --> 3473.819
really touch and prove and manipulate as

3470.799 --> 3477.189
there and that that's just like gravity

3473.819 --> 3480.159
it's the same kind of construction a

3477.189 --> 3482.799
thing that has to be there in order for

3480.159 --> 3490.63
things to function but you can't

3482.799 --> 3492.819
actually get it that's why I say that it

3490.63 --> 3495.399
just feels the same it just feels like

3492.819 --> 3498.479
no there's some other element about the

3495.399 --> 3502.929
whole nature of it that we're missing I

3498.479 --> 3505.989
don't think it is literally a field it's

3502.929 --> 3508.449
just a misunderstood part of the

3505.989 --> 3511.839
functions of what people have been

3508.449 --> 3515.919
trying to study with it with electrics

3511.839 --> 3518.319
and an optics and all that that's what I

3515.919 --> 3520.649
think will probably turn it out turn out

3518.319 --> 3520.649
to be

3535.01 --> 3543.21
Nicole Garland and pure medicine I'm

3540.54 --> 3545.9
getting a lot of people in chat it's

3543.21 --> 3545.9
good to see you

3556.18 --> 3563.319
I agree cept a P if there's an ether

3560.069 --> 3566.92
yeah but did but that's the whole thing

3563.319 --> 3569.38
about it the very concept of the ether

3566.92 --> 3572.619
is something that just goes through all

3569.38 --> 3576.1600000000003
things and is present everywhere per

3572.619 --> 3578.26
default by the very concept of it there

3576.16 --> 3583.69
should be no possibility to take away a

3578.26 --> 3586.9300000000003
chunk of it just like with gravity it's

3583.69 --> 3591.4
sorry to keep comparing it to that I'm

3586.93 --> 3594.7889999999998
not trying to break the progress I'm

3591.4 --> 3598.63
just saying the signs it the same growth

3594.789 --> 3600.4
pattern within the framework of the

3598.63 --> 3601.029
conceptualization of reality it's the

3600.4 --> 3604.319
same pattern

3601.029 --> 3604.319
I'm just recognizing it

3615.29 --> 3621.14
yeah I agree Dave cafard that is a very

3618.26 --> 3624.4700000000003
wise lesson when truth is on your side

3621.14 --> 3627.2599999999998
you can just stick to that stay away

3624.47 --> 3629.39
from arguing about nothing takes away

3627.26 --> 3631.13
from the truth yeah you agree and that

3629.39 --> 3636.25
is also kind of the thing that I felt

3631.13 --> 3641.36
bad about afterward after that yeah the

3636.25 --> 3644.57
verbal assaults on Jose's because it did

3641.36 --> 3648.59
serve a function though I I just need it

3644.57 --> 3652.6400000000003
I just wanted to lash out against

3648.59 --> 3655.61
somebody that deserved it it was like a

3652.64 --> 3658.94
move I really want these people to go

3655.61 --> 3661.25
away and I'm not gonna like poke troll

3658.94 --> 3663.5
them that like the Gama way no I just

3661.25 --> 3667.88
really want to give them a message Hey

3663.5 --> 3670.09
you sick demon piss off go rot away in a

3667.88 --> 3673.6
corner somewhere we nobody wants you

3670.09 --> 3676.34
unless the only other demons want you

3673.6 --> 3678.2
and they don't really want you they just

3676.34 --> 3681.6400000000003
want to have a safe ground where they

3678.2 --> 3684.6499999999996
can be that sick type of person and

3681.64 --> 3686.54
that's what really drove it it doesn't

3684.65 --> 3689.12
even have anything to do about the globe

3686.54 --> 3694.31
or Flat Earth or any of the technicals

3689.12 --> 3697.7
at all it was really about just the

3694.31 --> 3699.0499999999997
social aspects of it all because that

3697.7 --> 3708.98
does matter it does have a lot of

3699.05 --> 3712.6000000000004
influence good morning lumberjack a good

3708.98 --> 3718.12
rest is can do miracles for your health

3712.6 --> 3718.12
so it's never bad to sleep in sometimes

3719.83 --> 3724.2799999999997
anyway I'm gonna round out the show

3722.09 --> 3727.52
because the debates are just about to
