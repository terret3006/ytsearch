129.44 --> 133.68
yeah this is the third time now it seems

131.12 --> 137.59900000000002
to be working and chad is working

133.68 --> 141.28
so yeah starting late

137.599 --> 144.56
because of technical difficulties

141.28 --> 148.879
but i'm here all right so

144.56 --> 151.84
in this particular chat ubub is first

148.879 --> 152.56
nathan oakley 9080. good to see you here

151.84 --> 157.44
william b

152.56 --> 162.64000000000001
call right

157.44 --> 166.0
weather is there it's kind of fresh

162.64 --> 171.76
and windy and cloudy

166.0 --> 175.28
so yeah putting on a sweater today

171.76 --> 175.28
i don't know it could be worse

179.28 --> 185.84
all right so

187.92 --> 190.95899999999997
how are you all doing

191.76 --> 195.51899999999998
yeah yesterday's show i didn't watch it

194.72 --> 197.12
back man

195.519 --> 199.84
i didn't think it was all that great

197.12 --> 199.84
really

203.599 --> 208.959
it's like just my

207.28 --> 213.84
my head just wasn't really in the right

208.959 --> 213.84
place still distracted by

214.0 --> 222.4
by just nuisance things in my own life

218.159 --> 222.39999999999998
and yeah i'm pretty much residing to

223.599 --> 230.23899999999998
like adapt to the new situation

227.519 --> 231.12
financially for myself and just go with

230.239 --> 236.159
it

231.12 --> 236.159
basically no matter the cost because

236.879 --> 241.2
yeah there is no real viable option for

239.28 --> 242.08
me to just quit doing this and just

241.2 --> 243.92
start to get

242.08 --> 245.20000000000002
some kind of weird job out there right

243.92 --> 248.64
now i get

245.2 --> 251.92
so many issues on the way just from

248.64 --> 254.39999999999998
my own psyche alone

251.92 --> 256.239
all the corona nonsense and everything

254.4 --> 258.079
else

256.239 --> 259.75899999999996
at this point yeah that's just not a

258.079 --> 263.199
viable option unless i

259.759 --> 265.04
yeah have a good plan to psychologically

263.199 --> 265.68
torture myself for a period and then

265.04 --> 269.28000000000003
come out

265.68 --> 271.919
with barely anything at least i will

269.28 --> 275.11999999999995
have lost my mind

271.919 --> 276.96
so yeah i'd rather do this and

275.12 --> 279.6
try to cut down on everything and

276.96 --> 281.19899999999996
hopefully not on food

279.6 --> 283.52000000000004
but everything else at least i got

281.199 --> 287.04
tobacco for like the next

283.52 --> 290.08
four months at least so

287.04 --> 292.47900000000004
not running out of that but yeah that's

290.08 --> 292.479
about it

293.12 --> 299.12
and i don't know cutting down on coffee

296.479 --> 302.56
i haven't had any coffee today

299.12 --> 302.56
maybe that's for the better though

303.28 --> 308.08
you know i'm gonna see i because i'm so

306.08 --> 309.75899999999996
used to coffee also

308.08 --> 310.65
and i enjoy it especially with the

309.759 --> 312.639
tumeric in it

310.65 --> 314.79999999999995
[Music]

312.639 --> 317.36
then i forget sometimes it's also kind

314.8 --> 317.36
of like a

317.44 --> 322.0
metabolic agitator it does typically

322.24 --> 326.16
aggravate inflammation and i've been

324.16 --> 329.759
having situations in my jaw

326.16 --> 331.91900000000004
for a while and yeah i haven't had any

329.759 --> 335.36
coffee

331.919 --> 338.24
and maybe that will actually give some

335.36 --> 340.72
some rest to yeah to this situation and

338.24 --> 343.039
restore it completely

340.72 --> 345.12
so maybe that's kind of a good thing you

343.039 --> 348.56
know maybe the entire world or

345.12 --> 351.039
god or the network whatever

348.56 --> 352.4
has caused this situation to arrive

351.039 --> 354.639
specifically to just

352.4 --> 356.08
force me to cut down on these things so

354.639 --> 358.72
i can properly heal

356.08 --> 361.039
who knows you know afterward it usually

358.72 --> 367.6
turns out to be something like that

361.039 --> 369.84
even though it's very esoteric

367.6 --> 371.6
i don't know it's just how it works hey

369.84 --> 374.23999999999995
michael jones

371.6 --> 374.24
good to see you

377.6 --> 381.84000000000003
yes nathan's stream still going

382.0 --> 387.919
it was it was basically yesterday's show

386.08 --> 389.75899999999996
i think i think nathan is moving it

387.919 --> 393.59999999999997
because he wants to do a gofundme

389.759 --> 397.91900000000004
run live instead

393.6 --> 397.91900000000004
of the normal time slot for the premiere

406.84 --> 409.84
right

416.639 --> 419.039
right

419.919 --> 423.84
yeah anyway

426.24 --> 433.68
uh notes notes notes

430.319 --> 437.12
we're very busy again yesterday

433.68 --> 437.759
up until late late late very freaking

437.12 --> 440.88
late

437.759 --> 444.47900000000004
too late it's not good that late

440.88 --> 448.24
but yeah just catching streams

444.479 --> 450.56
uh after the flatter debate yesterday

448.24 --> 451.52
which was a pretty good show but i

450.56 --> 453.919
wasn't again

451.52 --> 455.84
too active i don't know i it feels like

453.919 --> 457.75899999999996
that maybe

455.84 --> 459.919
if you put it down next to the other

457.759 --> 460.88
shows it's not like that as much but i

459.919 --> 465.68
just

460.88 --> 469.039
felt like i was just

465.68 --> 470.08
didn't really i felt more like isolating

469.039 --> 474.31899999999996
myself

470.08 --> 477.52
i don't know not yeah socially

474.319 --> 478.0
because if yeah stressed and i don't

477.52 --> 482.4
know it's

478.0 --> 482.4
like the end of summer and all that

482.639 --> 487.28000000000003
yeah i'm not gonna call it like being

485.199 --> 489.84000000000003
depressed or anything but it is like in

487.28 --> 493.28
that direction it's those

489.84 --> 495.84
that thing and yeah i'm trying to work

493.28 --> 495.84
around it

498.16 --> 503.36
right so yeah that's just happening

501.28 --> 505.11999999999995
pretty much all throughout the day so i

503.36 --> 506.96000000000004
just have to deal with it

505.12 --> 508.319
let's go into super chat sent you a

506.96 --> 513.28
paper really

508.319 --> 513.28
nathan are you sure that's

516.959 --> 523.039
is that the real you

520.32 --> 523.0390000000001

532.0 --> 535.839
i have a little bit helps

541.92 --> 546.4799999999999
yeah and through paypal you know like

544.24 --> 550.32
things like two euros

546.48 --> 552.32
through paypal it's a lot more useful

550.32 --> 554.0
than when i get it in the super chat so

552.32 --> 556.24
yeah i appreciate that thank you very

554.0 --> 556.24
much

558.16 --> 563.8389999999999
don't get too excited no don't worry

560.56 --> 563.8389999999999
about it

565.92 --> 570.64
but anyway benjamin was live yesterday i

569.44 --> 574.48
think

570.64 --> 574.48
although i thought it wasn't live but it

574.839 --> 580.48
was

576.399 --> 582.24
i just listened to it in the background

580.48 --> 586.48
a lot

582.24 --> 590.8
but my mind was pretty much wandered off

586.48 --> 591.36
oh yeah right and then uh yeah have no

590.8 --> 594.88
sphere

591.36 --> 596.72
live stream from uh iron realm

594.88 --> 598.88
i pretty much sat through that whole

596.72 --> 601.839
thing like listen to it in background in

598.88 --> 603.4399999999999
and in chat and at some point it was

601.839 --> 607.0400000000001
pretty interesting like riley

603.44 --> 610.399
got on there and he actually

607.04 --> 613.519
called like people in government

610.399 --> 616.64
about very specific statements that were

613.519 --> 617.36
yeah he had spotted a flaw within the

616.64 --> 620.0
system

617.36 --> 623.6800000000001
as it were and the things that were said

620.0 --> 626.48
it's basically asking for accountability

623.68 --> 633.8389999999999
or an explanation and yeah that was

626.48 --> 633.839
interesting two phone calls

635.04 --> 641.1999999999999
yeah the first one just hung up

638.16 --> 643.279
and the second one you really try to

641.2 --> 647.0400000000001
basically

643.279 --> 649.36
get things sorted

647.04 --> 652.3199999999999
but yeah interested to see where riley's

649.36 --> 652.32
gonna go with that one

652.56 --> 655.92
that was pretty exciting to hear about

654.32 --> 658.72
that well

655.92 --> 660.959
yeah and then after that i was gonna go

658.72 --> 664.64
to bed but then benjamin went live

660.959 --> 670.2399999999999
again over life

664.64 --> 670.24
he did like a a live stream on

670.399 --> 676.24
uh instagram right on sunday and he

675.12 --> 678.5600000000001
basically did a

676.24 --> 679.92
premiere of that on the live played it

678.56 --> 681.76
out

679.92 --> 689.8389999999999

let's see

906.72 --> 909.6800000000001
expected

909.76 --> 913.8389999999999

right okay according to paypal that's

928.48 --> 933.6
all gonna arrive

929.44 --> 935.759
wednesday uh but at least i'd like

933.6 --> 936.8000000000001
this this gives me some good opportunity

935.759 --> 938.8000000000001
to basically

936.8 --> 941.199
yeah borrow some money and then just be

938.8 --> 944.4799999999999
able to give it back after that

941.199 --> 947.279
so thank you very much

944.48 --> 947.9200000000001
it's a great relief that it still keeps

947.279 --> 949.6
going

947.92 --> 951.519
and it makes me feel kind of annoyed

949.6 --> 954.72
that i got impatient yesterday

951.519 --> 955.199
because i did get impatient and it's

954.72 --> 957.6800000000001
like

955.199 --> 959.5999999999999
what am i doing i have a live show i do

957.68 --> 961.68
all kinds of things

959.6 --> 964.0790000000001
like all of this stuff is basically a

961.68 --> 964.079
bonus

965.279 --> 968.48
i can't get angry just because it's not

967.519 --> 971.519
like happening

968.48 --> 976.399
right there right then just to like

971.519 --> 979.44
help against my mind being nervous

976.399 --> 981.04
it's not a good way to do things i

979.44 --> 981.759
definitely did think about that

981.04 --> 984.7199999999999
yesterday

981.759 --> 986.24
after the show because yeah sure it's

984.72 --> 988.8000000000001
all justified and

986.24 --> 988.8
and all that

994.079 --> 997.92
yeah but this kind of situation has

996.56 --> 1000.6389999999999
happened before

997.92 --> 1001.8389999999999
probably last year a lot more of the

1000.639 --> 1005.6
time

1001.839 --> 1008.8000000000001
than this year it's just that i guess

1005.6 --> 1011.839
i've had a lot of really good shows on

1008.8 --> 1014.88
here on the flat earth early virtue

1011.839 --> 1015.6
and like recently in the last two months

1014.88 --> 1020.8
like

1015.6 --> 1020.8000000000001
really good stuff compared to last year

1020.959 --> 1025.839
because last year it was like hit and

1023.36 --> 1025.839
miss

1026.0 --> 1031.52
like i had a good show and then i went

1028.559 --> 1034.6399999999999
after like two shitty shows

1031.52 --> 1034.6399999999999
yeah really like

1036.319 --> 1040.6399999999999
because i didn't really know what to do

1038.64 --> 1042.24
what to talk about or i didn't want to

1040.64 --> 1044.0
talk about the subjects that had now

1042.24 --> 1047.36
this is also an issue

1044.0 --> 1050.48
this is a bigger issue

1047.36 --> 1052.0
there look there's always stuff to talk

1050.48 --> 1055.52
about and to draw people

1052.0 --> 1058.559
in with like always you want to talk

1055.52 --> 1061.76
endlessly and get a lot of crowd

1058.559 --> 1065.2
just talk about masks freaking mask

1061.76 --> 1067.84
24 7 channel only talking about masks

1065.2 --> 1070.64
from every direction from every angle

1067.84 --> 1073.9189999999999
for it against it masks only channel

1070.64 --> 1078.16
yeah you'll get a crowd

1073.919 --> 1078.16
but i [ __ ] hate talking about it

1078.64 --> 1084.16
so yeah and i'm faced with these types

1081.12 --> 1087.28
of issues more often

1084.16 --> 1088.24
and it's not like i'm angry about the

1087.28 --> 1091.44
people that

1088.24 --> 1092.88
follow me that they do i guess have

1091.44 --> 1094.72
things to say about it

1092.88 --> 1097.919
it's constantly shoved in everybody's

1094.72 --> 1101.039
face and things about this

1097.919 --> 1103.2
it's just that it feels so pointless to

1101.039 --> 1107.039
me

1103.2 --> 1110.16
like just the idea like a

1107.039 --> 1112.48
metaphorically a rough idea that

1110.16 --> 1113.3600000000001
i'm gonna have a show and every day at

1112.48 --> 1115.76
least

1113.36 --> 1117.28
i spend like a minute or two just

1115.76 --> 1120.8799999999999
reminding everybody that

1117.28 --> 1120.8799999999999
masks don't really work

1121.039 --> 1125.52
and it just seems so pointless to me

1126.72 --> 1134.72
yeah going about like that

1130.16 --> 1138.3200000000002
like at some point people should know

1134.72 --> 1138.32
they just should know

1139.84 --> 1146.24
and if they don't then yeah those people

1143.6 --> 1148.9599999999998
are so hard-learned basically that

1146.24 --> 1148.96
it's no use

1149.76 --> 1154.32
they'll they will just fall for whatever

1152.559 --> 1156.48
socially engineered trick

1154.32 --> 1159.039
that's going to be presented and they

1156.48 --> 1162.88
will not stop

1159.039 --> 1166.48
they will not figure it out they yeah

1162.88 --> 1168.4
they'd rather be fearful about

1166.48 --> 1170.0
everybody that's not going along

1168.4 --> 1174.16
everybody's that's trying to step

1170.0 --> 1177.36
out of it then to actually

1174.16 --> 1178.0
just let it sink in right so there's my

1177.36 --> 1181.52
two minutes

1178.0 --> 1181.52
talking about freaking masks

1189.679 --> 1193.3600000000001
right talking about netflix also like

1192.4 --> 1196.96
gets kind of tired

1193.36 --> 1199.36
i don't know what it is man maybe

1196.96 --> 1201.2
maybe just the juice just ran out for me

1199.36 --> 1204.559
maybe the summer juice just ran

1201.2 --> 1206.32
out remember like a month ago

1204.559 --> 1207.76
it's like i watched this and then i

1206.32 --> 1209.6789999999999
would just

1207.76 --> 1212.799
be reminded about something in it and

1209.679 --> 1215.919
ramble on for like 10 minutes

1212.799 --> 1218.08
and then suddenly jump to the next thing

1215.919 --> 1219.2
be reminded about that keep on continue

1218.08 --> 1222.08
and now it's like

1219.2 --> 1223.919
yeah i did this and i really don't

1222.08 --> 1224.96
either don't remember anything about it

1223.919 --> 1235.8400000000001
or that's just not

1224.96 --> 1235.8400000000001
interesting like i'm not interested

1238.88 --> 1249.8400000000001
yeah maybe and this is kind of weird

1242.24 --> 1249.84
maybe i just need a break

1257.679 --> 1263.8400000000001
what what

1274.84 --> 1277.84
what

1282.4 --> 1290.159
right hmm

1286.24 --> 1292.159
i'm michael jones yeah interesting yeah

1290.159 --> 1294.64
if you really know what to look for

1292.159 --> 1296.48
yeah you can find some good old movies

1294.64 --> 1298.7990000000002
on youtube

1296.48 --> 1301.44
was it like two years ago i watched a

1298.799 --> 1304.8799999999999
whole bunch of

1301.44 --> 1307.6000000000001
black and white science fiction

1304.88 --> 1309.7600000000002
from the 50s and 60s that was pretty

1307.6 --> 1313.36
interesting

1309.76 --> 1316.48
like a really old-fashioned

1313.36 --> 1319.84
futurism like sci-fi it was

1316.48 --> 1319.84
really interesting

1322.24 --> 1328.159
but yeah i'm gonna run out i'm just

1325.28 --> 1332.3999999999999
playing a game now

1328.159 --> 1335.1200000000001
replaying it but it just doesn't leave a

1332.4 --> 1335.1200000000001
lot of words

1335.52 --> 1347.84
i'm just i need my battery to refill

1350.32 --> 1355.28
maybe i just got distracted by talking

1352.799 --> 1357.44
to girls

1355.28 --> 1359.2
because there's been plenty of that too

1357.44 --> 1362.159
maybe that has just

1359.2 --> 1364.0
been distracting me too much as well

1362.159 --> 1367.679
like i don't want to do this anymore i

1364.0 --> 1367.679
just want to hang around with a girl now

1370.88 --> 1375.8400000000001
it has been a long time after all

1384.88 --> 1389.8400000000001
right george sanford

1390.159 --> 1394.72
yeah well netflix is doing all kinds of

1392.08 --> 1394.72
weird [ __ ]

1397.12 --> 1407.12
what's this

1403.84 --> 1411.9189999999999
right yeah the whole cuties

1407.12 --> 1414.9599999999998
thing it is creepy i've never

1411.919 --> 1417.8400000000001
clicked that looked it up by the way

1414.96 --> 1417.8400000000001
not gonna

1419.12 --> 1424.7199999999998
god the photographs in that article are

1421.52 --> 1428.4
just terrible enough

1424.72 --> 1431.3600000000001
it's so creepy like

1428.4 --> 1434.0
they might think it's all sassy but it's

1431.36 --> 1434.0
just wrong

1443.84 --> 1449.6399999999999
yeah yeah maybe

1447.36 --> 1451.279
you know maybe talking about

1449.64 --> 1453.44
demoralization

1451.279 --> 1454.799
maybe it didn't really help that

1453.44 --> 1458.0800000000002
yesterday

1454.799 --> 1461.679
alex jones like sometimes

1458.08 --> 1465.52
i wonder like why do i even watch

1461.679 --> 1468.0800000000002
him anymore because he does

1465.52 --> 1473.6
drag you down into like the ultimate

1468.08 --> 1476.72
gutter sometimes and he did it again ugh

1473.6 --> 1477.52
yeah explaining things that disgusting

1476.72 --> 1480.32
satanists

1477.52 --> 1482.1589999999999
do that i i don't even care to repeat

1480.32 --> 1485.4399999999998
here it's so disgusting

1482.159 --> 1487.679
like i i don't want to even bring that

1485.44 --> 1490.88
the memories of the imagery to the

1487.679 --> 1490.88
forefront in my head

1493.76 --> 1497.279
and i'm just baffled every time like

1495.679 --> 1501.52
okay

1497.279 --> 1504.559
so is that real if that's real

1501.52 --> 1506.32
how do you trace it and how do you stop

1504.559 --> 1508.96
it

1506.32 --> 1509.6
like what is this it just seems like

1508.96 --> 1511.6000000000001
it's

1509.6 --> 1513.6
yeah just another puppet yeah yeah

1511.6 --> 1515.1999999999998
everybody's another puppet

1513.6 --> 1516.02
i don't know what the [ __ ] he's doing

1515.2 --> 1517.919
with that

1516.02 --> 1519.9189999999999
[Music]

1517.919 --> 1524.0
whether he's just there to basically

1519.919 --> 1524.0
prevent people from snoozing off

1525.279 --> 1534.08
maybe he's just tries to wreak

1529.52 --> 1537.52
yeah reel in all the savages

1534.08 --> 1539.52
with that like

1537.52 --> 1541.44
yeah people that because there's plenty

1539.52 --> 1543.6
of people out there that

1541.44 --> 1545.3600000000001
that don't have that thing in them

1543.6 --> 1548.24
holding it back and they're just gonna

1545.36 --> 1550.4799999999998
dig into the worst hell holes imaginable

1548.24 --> 1551.039
and then work out every single detail

1550.48 --> 1554.159
and why

1551.039 --> 1556.799
basically become experts at like

1554.159 --> 1559.279
disgusting torture things

1556.799 --> 1560.72
because they just they're not stopping

1559.279 --> 1564.559
in their investigation

1560.72 --> 1566.559
they should they should

1564.559 --> 1568.48
but they don't there's nothing holding

1566.559 --> 1570.48
them back

1568.48 --> 1573.44
and so they learn the most disgusting

1570.48 --> 1576.24
[ __ ] ever and then they can

1573.44 --> 1577.76
have that in their mind all day long

1576.24 --> 1585.6
goody

1577.76 --> 1588.96
hey yeah if you want to live in hell

1585.6 --> 1590.8799999999999
yeah oh come on can you just drop the

1588.96 --> 1599.8400000000001
time warner [ __ ]

1590.88 --> 1599.8400000000001
get it already

1600.32 --> 1602.6399999999999
no

1605.84 --> 1609.9189999999999
i'm not a hollywood actor

1619.36 --> 1624.84
yeah proven fact well why don't you

1622.4 --> 1627.8400000000001
pay for billboards and just put it

1624.84 --> 1627.84
everywhere

1628.0 --> 1641.84
because so what

1652.84 --> 1655.84
so

1659.36 --> 1668.7199999999998
you know it like i don't watch

1662.96 --> 1671.52
alex jones because i believe in him

1668.72 --> 1672.72
that he's all just great no he is just a

1671.52 --> 1676.799
media

1672.72 --> 1683.84
guy now and he's

1676.799 --> 1683.84
doing it his own way

1702.159 --> 1705.679
yeah look george sanford did i say it's

1704.559 --> 1710.1589999999999
not true

1705.679 --> 1711.8400000000001
did i say it's not true

1710.159 --> 1713.919
i'm just getting tired of you bringing

1711.84 --> 1717.4399999999998
that up all the time

1713.919 --> 1717.44
like nobody cares

1718.559 --> 1722.8799999999999
it doesn't matter like all the people on

1721.84 --> 1725.279
the front

1722.88 --> 1727.44
they're all corrupted there's nobody

1725.279 --> 1729.76
that's not corrupted

1727.44 --> 1732.72
because you can't get on the [ __ ]

1729.76 --> 1736.0
front if you're not corrupted

1732.72 --> 1737.039
so who gives a [ __ ] he works for time

1736.0 --> 1740.559
warner

1737.039 --> 1753.84
has ties with them who gives a flying

1740.559 --> 1753.84
[ __ ] about that

1773.76 --> 1781.84
all right

1788.799 --> 1795.84
i have no idea who you're talking about

1792.84 --> 1795.84
there

1811.44 --> 1818.159
right so you know maybe i should just

1815.36 --> 1818.1589999999999
do that more

1819.2 --> 1825.2
just get pissed off again

1822.559 --> 1827.2
just get pissed off and everyone doing

1825.2 --> 1830.0800000000002
the same [ __ ] over and over again

1827.2 --> 1832.32
didn't i already explain how i actually

1830.08 --> 1834.08
watch media

1832.32 --> 1835.4399999999998
didn't i already explained that george

1834.08 --> 1838.8799999999999
sanford

1835.44 --> 1842.64
or are you just chanting this stuff

1838.88 --> 1845.679
to remind yourself because

1842.64 --> 1849.279
yeah every [ __ ]

1845.679 --> 1850.24
thing is corrupt every [ __ ] thing out

1849.279 --> 1854.72
there

1850.24 --> 1858.799
all media even the small ones

1854.72 --> 1863.2
all of it what is corruption

1858.799 --> 1866.0
they half of the times don't even know

1863.2 --> 1867.679
because it's not like oh this contract

1866.0 --> 1870.72
contractual obligation

1867.679 --> 1872.24
no no that's that's more higher up but

1870.72 --> 1872.96
when you get to that stage you're

1872.24 --> 1875.039
already so

1872.96 --> 1877.519
far in you've already made up your mind

1875.039 --> 1881.039
what you're gonna do

1877.519 --> 1884.64
what you're gonna promote how you are

1881.039 --> 1887.36
devoted to manipulate the public

1884.64 --> 1888.3990000000001
specifically because that's what it

1887.36 --> 1893.279
takes

1888.399 --> 1896.08
to get up there and do that

1893.279 --> 1898.559
and so you analyze every message

1896.08 --> 1900.24
everything every objective every

1898.559 --> 1903.2
long-term goal

1900.24 --> 1904.72
exactly for what it is what it means

1903.2 --> 1907.919
then you network it out

1904.72 --> 1910.3990000000001
see who is on to that and then you start

1907.919 --> 1912.64
to get the dynamic of it all

1910.399 --> 1913.5189999999998
if you're literally gonna believe any

1912.64 --> 1917.919
individual

1913.519 --> 1920.08
and just think that they are always good

1917.919 --> 1923.039
you're always going to be misled because

1920.08 --> 1926.32
that's not how it works anymore

1923.039 --> 1926.32
if it ever has even

1933.279 --> 1937.44
oh miss kang good to see you

1941.6 --> 1945.6789999999999
right so yeah i do need to get pissed

1943.44 --> 1949.2
off because then [ __ ] starts to happen

1945.679 --> 1951.679
even if it makes no freaking sense

1949.2 --> 1953.2
you know better it's that's the weird

1951.679 --> 1954.88
thing now i remember

1953.2 --> 1956.48
now that i'm getting pissed off i

1954.88 --> 1960.0
actually remember

1956.48 --> 1962.159
how [ __ ] typical because big bear

1960.0 --> 1965.2
kind of talked about that

1962.159 --> 1968.0800000000002
on that sunday stream

1965.2 --> 1968.0800000000002
like yeah

1970.64 --> 1975.76
if you feel shitty about something

1973.84 --> 1977.36
if you're depressed even or if you're

1975.76 --> 1980.559
angry just

1977.36 --> 1983.4399999999998
be honest about it let it out and do

1980.559 --> 1984.1589999999999
something with it rather than choking on

1983.44 --> 1986.0
it

1984.159 --> 1988.72
trying to hold it back and that's kind

1986.0 --> 1988.72
of my problem

1989.279 --> 1994.08
because when i feel shitty i'm like no

1992.24 --> 1996.88
that's not the way i want things to go

1994.08 --> 2000.24
so i'm just gonna pause it

1996.88 --> 2001.6000000000001
like almost like a computer fashion like

2000.24 --> 2006.64
oh output is incorrect

2001.6 --> 2008.8799999999999
us go on standby wait until it's changed

2006.64 --> 2010.64
it actually doesn't work like that at

2008.88 --> 2014.48
all it's a very weird

2010.64 --> 2016.5590000000002
habit that i put up yeah that i took on

2014.48 --> 2018.48
when it was much younger and did like

2016.559 --> 2022.799
didn't know how to deal with people

2018.48 --> 2024.559
at all that was my strategy it's like oh

2022.799 --> 2026.399
bad output i'm gonna hold it back

2024.559 --> 2028.96
otherwise people are gonna

2026.399 --> 2031.4399999999998
get really pissed off with me and then

2028.96 --> 2036.3990000000001
i'm gonna get it

2031.44 --> 2039.8400000000001
but yeah it's i'm not that kid anymore

2036.399 --> 2041.6789999999999
so i'm just gonna throw out whatever the

2039.84 --> 2043.6
[ __ ] i'm gonna feel whether i'm pissed

2041.679 --> 2046.96
off whether i'm exhilarated

2043.6 --> 2048.96
whether or not manic or crazy i'm just

2046.96 --> 2051.2
gonna

2048.96 --> 2052.7200000000003
throw it out there and just see whatever

2051.2 --> 2054.879
the [ __ ] happens

2052.72 --> 2056.72
even if it makes no damn sense even if

2054.879 --> 2057.839
it makes me feel like i'm totally

2056.72 --> 2061.4399999999996
ungrateful

2057.839 --> 2063.2799999999997
like i'm a complete [ __ ]

2061.44 --> 2064.7200000000003
and i'm wasting everybody's time even

2063.28 --> 2067.76
though i'm not

2064.72 --> 2069.839
because yeah then i can actually watch

2067.76 --> 2071.44
myself and compare it to somebody else's

2069.839 --> 2072.32
show out there not saying everybody's

2071.44 --> 2075.359
bad

2072.32 --> 2076.96
but holy [ __ ] there's a lot of time

2075.359 --> 2081.839
wasting going on out there

2076.96 --> 2083.919
holy [ __ ] unbelievable

2081.839 --> 2086.839
what people do on the internet and think

2083.919 --> 2090.24
that it actually contributes to

2086.839 --> 2090.24
something god

2091.2 --> 2095.7599999999998
yeah and then again there's people

2093.2 --> 2097.68
probably

2095.76 --> 2100.7200000000003
how dare they think exactly the same

2097.68 --> 2102.64
about me and what i do

2100.72 --> 2104.8799999999997
because there's people that are just

2102.64 --> 2107.92
much better organized

2104.88 --> 2107.92
more professional

2108.64 --> 2114.8799999999997
and they just work and build

2112.24 --> 2116.24
and plan and structurize and get other

2114.88 --> 2119.599
people in on it and

2116.24 --> 2120.8799999999997
get employees and all that yeah never

2119.599 --> 2125.3590000000004
went there

2120.88 --> 2125.359
never got that far too much of a weirdo

2125.44 --> 2132.56
but at the same time i want to try

2130.8 --> 2134.079
like step into something and just

2132.56 --> 2137.2
freaking doing it and just

2134.079 --> 2139.52
never mind the anxiety like i'll

2137.2 --> 2140.8799999999997
kill it i'll literally murder the

2139.52 --> 2143.92
anxiety that i

2140.88 --> 2144.56
feel because it just comes boiling up

2143.92 --> 2146.7200000000003
i'll just

2144.56 --> 2149.04
murder it like no no no no you're going

2146.72 --> 2150.8799999999997
to feel that

2149.04 --> 2152.48
you're not going to escape from it

2150.88 --> 2154.6400000000003
literally stand

2152.48 --> 2155.599
in that spot in that concentrated

2154.64 --> 2159.839
hellish spot

2155.599 --> 2159.839
stand there right now until it's gone

2160.0 --> 2166.079
and just [ __ ] do it i'll do it

2163.44 --> 2173.839
because it will have some purpose

2166.079 --> 2173.8390000000004
because i know it's useful

2174.079 --> 2177.3590000000004
i know it's your checkup

2178.96 --> 2184.839
and i've even explained that but it

2181.44 --> 2186.079
still makes me freaking frustrated as

2184.839 --> 2188.0789999999997
hell

2186.079 --> 2189.3590000000004
i'm seeing like whoa these people man

2188.079 --> 2192.8
they're building like

2189.359 --> 2194.72
really good structured pieces

2192.8 --> 2196.1600000000003
and people are gonna watch that and see

2194.72 --> 2198.64
like wow

2196.16 --> 2201.1189999999997
that guy really knows how what he talks

2198.64 --> 2202.64
about it's so clear with the extra

2201.119 --> 2205.359
imagery and all that [ __ ] and then i

2202.64 --> 2209.1189999999997
realized like [ __ ]

2205.359 --> 2212.4
that's i can't even do that i'm

2209.119 --> 2216.56
for me it's just the verbals but

2212.4 --> 2220.32
yeah somebody could plan out to be good

2216.56 --> 2222.64
verbally explain something

2220.32 --> 2224.079
have great video assistance thinking out

2222.64 --> 2226.16
thinking out again

2224.079 --> 2228.5600000000004
perfecting perfecting perfecting until

2226.16 --> 2232.24
it's just fantastic

2228.56 --> 2236.48
i can't do that the only really

2232.24 --> 2237.1189999999997
positive consolidation price although it

2236.48 --> 2239.76
can be

2237.119 --> 2240.4
quite a grand prize sometimes is that in

2239.76 --> 2243.119
a

2240.4 --> 2245.04
sudden moment i'll figure something out

2243.119 --> 2247.599
really quickly

2245.04 --> 2248.48
and suddenly reach almost like into the

2247.599 --> 2252.96
future and

2248.48 --> 2257.44
hand out this instantaneous prediction

2252.96 --> 2260.56
that's actually kind of valuable

2257.44 --> 2264.0
because it's so pure and that's

2260.56 --> 2266.56
unique but yeah grass is greener on the

2264.0 --> 2266.56
other side

2267.28 --> 2271.8390000000004
i wish it could be like these people

2269.359 --> 2276.24
sometimes and just do it like that

2271.839 --> 2276.24
then again i would

2276.8 --> 2285.8390000000004
not have a lot of maneuvering room

2280.0 --> 2285.839
just being myself

2296.839 --> 2299.839
uh

2310.72 --> 2314.0
uh i don't know what you're blabbering

2312.72 --> 2317.5989999999997
about my tones

2314.0 --> 2327.839
goods i haven't

2317.599 --> 2327.839
prank called anyone since i was like 12.

2330.48 --> 2335.68
right yeah well what people do with

2333.599 --> 2337.3590000000004
their presentations and perfecting all

2335.68 --> 2340.64
that

2337.359 --> 2341.92
i have similar skills but it's complete

2340.64 --> 2343.839
waste of time because

2341.92 --> 2345.2000000000003
that perfection of skills i tend to

2343.839 --> 2350.16
reach in games

2345.2 --> 2353.1189999999997
which is like completely useless

2350.16 --> 2355.5989999999997
except the best i can get out of it is

2353.119 --> 2358.4
that i learn more about

2355.599 --> 2361.28
interfaces learning structures and what

2358.4 --> 2363.599
is efficient how the mind will

2361.28 --> 2363.599
work

2367.359 --> 2373.68
but yeah i don't know

2370.72 --> 2374.9599999999996
i always get every time i say something

2373.68 --> 2377.52
oh man

2374.96 --> 2378.64
i do this it's completely useless then i

2377.52 --> 2380.64
think about it

2378.64 --> 2382.64
for three more seconds and then i figure

2380.64 --> 2384.56
out oh wait no it's not completely

2382.64 --> 2386.0
useless because i don't do things that

2384.56 --> 2388.64
are completely useless i

2386.0 --> 2390.96
only do things that i can get something

2388.64 --> 2390.96
out of

2391.359 --> 2399.52
in some way like there is no

2395.44 --> 2401.52
pause there is never a pause whatever

2399.52 --> 2403.119
i'm do i'm going to get something out of

2401.52 --> 2406.16
it

2403.119 --> 2407.2000000000003
because the only alternative to getting

2406.16 --> 2410.64
something out of it

2407.2 --> 2412.0
is feeling like i'm literally wasting

2410.64 --> 2414.56
time

2412.0 --> 2415.119
like a sensation on top of whatever i'm

2414.56 --> 2417.7599999999998
doing

2415.119 --> 2419.2000000000003
that is terrible so i gotta have like an

2417.76 --> 2421.599
objective okay i'm doing

2419.2 --> 2423.04
something this is how it works this is

2421.599 --> 2425.04
what i'll be doing

2423.04 --> 2427.359
what can i get out of it while i'm doing

2425.04 --> 2430.48
it and it's not a planned thing

2427.359 --> 2432.48
it's just a focus

2430.48 --> 2434.0
so when i get on my bike to get

2432.48 --> 2438.319
groceries

2434.0 --> 2441.92
that's sports to me

2438.319 --> 2446.079
and yeah on top of that

2441.92 --> 2449.2000000000003
yeah like traffic yeah now do you say uh

2446.079 --> 2452.4
traffic dynamics also because

2449.2 --> 2453.04
every as i said every single freaking

2452.4 --> 2456.88
thing you could

2453.04 --> 2459.68
ever imagine i study it

2456.88 --> 2461.44
like i even study traffic dynamics like

2459.68 --> 2464.8799999999997
i study

2461.44 --> 2468.2400000000002
how i can literally through just a few

2464.88 --> 2469.04
signs ignore all traffic lights on my

2468.24 --> 2471.1189999999997
bike

2469.04 --> 2473.2799999999997
never get into an accident and not even

2471.119 --> 2474.319
have to look around if something is

2473.28 --> 2477.6800000000003
coming

2474.319 --> 2481.599
because i study the traffic dynamics

2477.68 --> 2484.319
i really do and it's out of boredom

2481.599 --> 2486.1600000000003
though like that's where it's originally

2484.319 --> 2487.7599999999998
coming from that boredom is like either

2486.16 --> 2490.72
a huge burden or

2487.76 --> 2492.3190000000004
i just put it to work like some kind of

2490.72 --> 2495.4399999999996
weird ai computer

2492.319 --> 2497.839
like okay study this get

2495.44 --> 2498.48
skills and perfection out of that just

2497.839 --> 2500.72
do that

2498.48 --> 2501.68
you know i don't have anything better to

2500.72 --> 2504.7999999999997
do for you just

2501.68 --> 2505.359
study this whatever i'm doing wherever i

2504.8 --> 2508.319
am

2505.359 --> 2509.119
if i'm sitting in some group at a party

2508.319 --> 2512.24
yeah

2509.119 --> 2514.319
there's people like blah blah blah

2512.24 --> 2515.7599999999998
watching something eating kind of

2514.319 --> 2519.119
wasting their time

2515.76 --> 2521.44
getting really dumb on alcohol and i'm

2519.119 --> 2525.2000000000003
there like

2521.44 --> 2526.56
damn it okay i'll study the social

2525.2 --> 2528.3999999999996
dynamics then

2526.56 --> 2530.88
what are people up to how is the

2528.4 --> 2531.6800000000003
vernacular what is the new type of

2530.88 --> 2533.6800000000003
attitude

2531.68 --> 2535.04
what are these people watching on tv

2533.68 --> 2539.04
what are they copying for

2535.04 --> 2542.079
ah and that's me i can't

2539.04 --> 2544.96
stop doing that never

2542.079 --> 2548.8390000000004
i can never stop doing that i haven't

2544.96 --> 2551.839
been able to stop doing that since i was

2548.839 --> 2551.839
12.

2558.24 --> 2565.839
and never just just

2561.839 --> 2565.839
do nothing

2580.72 --> 2588.0789999999997
oh goody no that's that's

2584.8 --> 2593.119
not a joke in my lane

2588.079 --> 2596.96
my good town my town goods

2593.119 --> 2596.96
i think that's more of an agm joke

2600.96 --> 2609.44
he'd appreciate that don't sell myself

2604.839 --> 2611.599
short well how do i do that

2609.44 --> 2613.76
how am i selling myself short i'm

2611.599 --> 2616.7200000000003
actually selling myself i'm telling you

2613.76 --> 2618.96
look on the surface it may seem like i

2616.72 --> 2622.0
have a pretty damn boring life

2618.96 --> 2624.0
like really very simple

2622.0 --> 2627.119
very little things i do very little

2624.0 --> 2630.319
people i even interact with

2627.119 --> 2633.28
but with the things i do i do a lot

2630.319 --> 2634.0
i study it's like i have this big

2633.28 --> 2637.28
computer in my

2634.0 --> 2640.319
head that's just studying society

2637.28 --> 2642.7200000000003
in order to emulate it

2640.319 --> 2642.72
really

2643.44 --> 2650.29
[Music]

2647.44 --> 2652.319
and it gets a lot of energy

2650.29 --> 2656.64
[Music]

2652.319 --> 2660.88
it's like a project and it's ongoing

2656.64 --> 2660.8799999999997
it does help assist oversight it

2661.359 --> 2666.72
helps me look seriously all my social

2664.24 --> 2668.64
studies just studying people because i'm

2666.72 --> 2671.2799999999997
not a normal person or don't feel like

2668.64 --> 2673.839
once i just end up studying everyone

2671.28 --> 2674.3190000000004
it has helped a lot in trying to get a

2673.839 --> 2678.88
better

2674.319 --> 2678.88
grip on what people are like on average

2679.599 --> 2682.079
because

2682.88 --> 2686.4
i feel very alienated from the general

2685.92 --> 2691.839
public

2686.4 --> 2691.839
most of the time

2696.319 --> 2700.0
and it has helped me a lot just doing

2698.48 --> 2704.319
that anyway

2700.0 --> 2706.56
just figuring out okay

2704.319 --> 2708.16
i can put this down i will p then

2706.56 --> 2711.92
actually instantly know

2708.16 --> 2713.839
how people will react to that

2711.92 --> 2715.76
on themselves even if they're not

2713.839 --> 2718.72
talking about it

2715.76 --> 2719.0400000000004
just understanding how do people respond

2718.72 --> 2722.64
to

2719.04 --> 2724.72
things like anything

2722.64 --> 2726.24
and what does it really mean how do they

2724.72 --> 2730.16
really develop not

2726.24 --> 2734.3999999999996
based on storytelling and yeah old

2730.16 --> 2736.8799999999997
ideas but actually what are people

2734.4 --> 2738.319
what are they really how do they really

2736.88 --> 2741.28
work

2738.319 --> 2742.319
because yeah we there's giants amount of

2741.28 --> 2745.3590000000004
stories

2742.319 --> 2748.16
trying to pre make us believe that

2745.359 --> 2749.839
we don't work how we really work but

2748.16 --> 2751.2
that we are working in a different way

2749.839 --> 2755.359
and that we're supposed to be

2751.2 --> 2758.0
like that different way when you're not

2755.359 --> 2761.839
okay you're out of here stop wasting my

2758.0 --> 2761.839
time with stupid questions

2777.89 --> 2781.12
[Music]

2784.01 --> 2790.1600000000003
[Music]

2787.839 --> 2792.24
right yeah martin tallberg but i'm not

2790.16 --> 2794.56
talking about society normal because

2792.24 --> 2797.839
society normal is anything but normal

2794.56 --> 2800.64
i'm talking about actual normal

2797.839 --> 2801.52
like figuring out what are people really

2800.64 --> 2805.04
how do they

2801.52 --> 2805.04
really respond to things

2805.28 --> 2810.6400000000003
what is life really like to normal

2808.24 --> 2810.64
people

2810.96 --> 2818.0
how do they see the world who do they

2814.64 --> 2821.2799999999997
think they are but how do they

2818.0 --> 2824.319
really work because it usually is

2821.28 --> 2826.7200000000003
not really unified all that well on

2824.319 --> 2826.72
average

2828.319 --> 2833.92
yeah that's right actual normal martin

2831.44 --> 2833.92
tolbert

2841.28 --> 2848.7200000000003
like the new normal is insane

2845.28 --> 2850.88
the current normal is not really normal

2848.72 --> 2853.68
but there is a normal that's actually

2850.88 --> 2856.839
normal we just forgot about it

2853.68 --> 2858.72
and we've been too distracted to

2856.839 --> 2860.64
basically

2858.72 --> 2862.72
have a clear sight on what that's really

2860.64 --> 2865.44
supposed to be anymore even we get too

2862.72 --> 2869.68
distracted too easily entangled with

2865.44 --> 2873.119
current normals right

2869.68 --> 2876.48
but the real normal it does exist

2873.119 --> 2879.92
and it's intuitive it's pure it's

2876.48 --> 2882.72
much more natural and gives room

2879.92 --> 2885.119
to things and elements of human traits

2882.72 --> 2888.7999999999997
human characteristics

2885.119 --> 2890.2400000000002
that now just don't come out they don't

2888.8 --> 2892.559
have a chance

2890.24 --> 2893.7599999999998
to get out because they're just too

2892.559 --> 2897.92
snowed under

2893.76 --> 2900.96
other effects too too much strain

2897.92 --> 2904.0
too many hoops to jump through

2900.96 --> 2906.48
all these things just take away

2904.0 --> 2906.48
unique

2907.28 --> 2915.2000000000003
yeah unique silent traits

2912.0 --> 2916.72
that are not as straightforward as as

2915.2 --> 2918.3999999999996
the most things they're not so much in

2916.72 --> 2920.24
your face they're more subtle

2918.4 --> 2922.8
and those traits get lost because they

2920.24 --> 2923.68
don't have a chance to manifest anymore

2922.8 --> 2925.92
in people

2923.68 --> 2927.839
because they're too caught up in the new

2925.92 --> 2931.28
normal

2927.839 --> 2934.319
the current normal with the new normal

2931.28 --> 2936.1600000000003
in the outlook somehow trying to justify

2934.319 --> 2938.16
that

2936.16 --> 2939.92
that that's coming and that it's

2938.16 --> 2940.319
inevitable there's an illusion about

2939.92 --> 2942.8
that

2940.319 --> 2945.839
instead of looking back like what is

2942.8 --> 2945.8390000000004
actual normal

2947.359 --> 2957.04
yeah i'm gonna call this episode like

2950.4 --> 2961.04
that that's actually not a bad idea

2957.04 --> 2961.04
the new normal

2961.119 --> 2971.6800000000003
current normal and

2964.64 --> 2976.16
actual normal i like that

2971.68 --> 2978.0
yeah i really like that huh

2976.16 --> 2982.319
and all i have to do is just give

2978.0 --> 2982.319
recognition that i'm pissed off at moody

2982.64 --> 2986.0
and yeah turns out into a pretty decent

2985.04 --> 2999.839
show after all

2986.0 --> 2999.839
huh typical

3009.599 --> 3013.28
right martin tolberg you you understand

3012.079 --> 3017.28
right yeah

3013.28 --> 3017.28
little kids are actually normal

3021.68 --> 3025.1189999999997
and then yeah unfortunately most of them

3024.48 --> 3028.72
when they

3025.119 --> 3028.7200000000003
kind of grow up in their teens

3028.8 --> 3034.559
they become the current normal

3032.8 --> 3036.4
and then if they're getting all power

3034.559 --> 3037.2000000000003
hungry and want to take control of

3036.4 --> 3041.44
society

3037.2 --> 3044.96
then they start to become the new normal

3041.44 --> 3047.599
you see the pattern see the pattern

3044.96 --> 3048.16
it's a pattern it's a gem just out of

3047.599 --> 3050.88
nowhere

3048.16 --> 3050.8799999999997
just like that

3053.68 --> 3057.04
i guess all i had to do is just be

3055.92 --> 3059.359
honest

3057.04 --> 3062.119
that i feel shitty and that i'm pissed

3059.359 --> 3065.52
off and

3062.119 --> 3066.2400000000002
dissatisfied and hey i got a great new

3065.52 --> 3083.839
concept

3066.24 --> 3083.839
just sprouting up out of nowhere

3094.839 --> 3097.839
uh

3098.079 --> 3101.6800000000003
right a man like me yeah that's true

3102.079 --> 3108.96
yeah well after 9 11 the pace

3105.839 --> 3110.88
of the new normalization definitely

3108.96 --> 3114.559
started to increase

3110.88 --> 3115.6800000000003
it really is like first it was just a

3114.559 --> 3117.599
building army

3115.68 --> 3119.04
then they basically started to march at

3117.599 --> 3122.2400000000002
9 11

3119.04 --> 3125.839
and they've been increasing speed

3122.24 --> 3127.52
like when trump got in they

3125.839 --> 3129.7599999999998
well when obama got in they

3127.52 --> 3131.92
significantly increased the pace and

3129.76 --> 3134.4
they really started to get into remember

3131.92 --> 3135.599
the social justice warrior revolution in

3134.4 --> 3138.64
the west

3135.599 --> 3143.599
horrific that's when the army like

3138.64 --> 3146.4
really started to started to make speed

3143.599 --> 3150.319
and then trump happened and yeah then

3146.4 --> 3150.319
the trench digging kind of began

3151.359 --> 3154.88
but there yeah the new normal it's

3153.2 --> 3156.7999999999997
getting more serious it's getting more

3154.88 --> 3159.6800000000003
aggressive more demonic

3156.8 --> 3162.96
more blatantly just a giant control

3159.68 --> 3165.7599999999998
scheme a mind control scheme

3162.96 --> 3166.16
that's what it is that's what it is to

3165.76 --> 3168.3190000000004
those

3166.16 --> 3171.68
people that deal with that do that you

3168.319 --> 3171.68
know just as i described

3172.319 --> 3179.44
you get born you are

3176.0 --> 3181.76
actually normal and then

3179.44 --> 3183.119
yeah when you grow older you're very

3181.76 --> 3185.0400000000004
like yeah you want to

3183.119 --> 3186.96
become part of society you want to have

3185.04 --> 3187.839
some place you want yeah you figure out

3186.96 --> 3190.0
yourself you

3187.839 --> 3192.48
become current normal which is not

3190.0 --> 3193.2
exactly normal it's more adapted like

3192.48 --> 3195.92
popular

3193.2 --> 3197.359
that sort of thing and then yeah if you

3195.92 --> 3198.8
really get power hungry you start to

3197.359 --> 3201.2799999999997
figure things out how it really works

3198.8 --> 3202.96
and you you want to make your move

3201.28 --> 3205.28
you want to take control become a little

3202.96 --> 3208.0
demon of yourself yeah then you start to

3205.28 --> 3211.3590000000004
adopt the new normal

3208.0 --> 3214.96
not because you literally believe it but

3211.359 --> 3216.7999999999997
because you believe in doing that

3214.96 --> 3218.48
and you believe in the system that

3216.8 --> 3220.8
upholds that

3218.48 --> 3222.079
and eventually figure out yeah it's

3220.8 --> 3225.92
literally a mind

3222.079 --> 3230.319
control system to gain

3225.92 --> 3233.839
autocratic control but kind of like

3230.319 --> 3236.0
autocratic and voluntary because mind

3233.839 --> 3240.0789999999997
control technically is a voluntary

3236.0 --> 3251.839
system people are mind controlled they

3240.079 --> 3251.8390000000004
have succumb they surrender

3260.48 --> 3268.0
hmm yeah tv has been around for a long

3265.76 --> 3268.0
time

3269.04 --> 3274.4
although as things are going it's

3271.599 --> 3277.839
probably not gonna make a hundred years

3274.4 --> 3278.4
it's probably gonna be gone before that

3277.839 --> 3281.359
time

3278.4 --> 3281.359
like completely

3285.28 --> 3290.7200000000003
it will just be completely computerized

3290.839 --> 3293.839
everything

3295.52 --> 3302.72
oh a throne render sorry

3300.079 --> 3304.6400000000003
but you never had a ball to begin with i

3302.72 --> 3307.839
can't give it back to you

3304.64 --> 3307.839
you never had a ball

3308.88 --> 3321.839
you just thought you did

3349.76 --> 3354.0
yeah in a way a man like me you're

3351.52 --> 3354.0
you're right

3354.16 --> 3358.0
it has always been like that

3358.72 --> 3364.0789999999997
but yeah you gotta realize

3361.839 --> 3365.119
in the last 100 years there's been a lot

3364.079 --> 3370.079
of changes

3365.119 --> 3372.7200000000003
societal where before a lot of people

3370.079 --> 3374.799
they were just more busy surviving on

3372.72 --> 3377.2
average

3374.799 --> 3379.68
and which does bring them closer to

3377.2 --> 3382.3999999999996
logos closer to god

3379.68 --> 3384.72
naturally and then like so much

3382.4 --> 3388.0
technological development has

3384.72 --> 3391.5989999999997
happened that the controllers had it

3388.0 --> 3395.52
relatively easy just laying out the root

3391.599 --> 3400.1600000000003
of control of manipulation social change

3395.52 --> 3402.24
to just lay it out there and people yeah

3400.16 --> 3404.16
there was no real alternative it's just

3402.24 --> 3406.0
all new stuff they just had

3404.16 --> 3407.2
spent all their time getting used to it

3406.0 --> 3410.319
and figuring out what

3407.2 --> 3413.4399999999996
everything is and how to go

3410.319 --> 3416.5589999999997
about with what has yeah what

3413.44 --> 3419.839
came to pass that

3416.559 --> 3422.6400000000003
people were too busy to even

3419.839 --> 3424.5589999999997
realize or figure out that it was a real

3422.64 --> 3428.16
danger they're in

3424.559 --> 3431.6800000000003
all that manipulation society building

3428.16 --> 3433.92
you know though went so fast

3431.68 --> 3436.16
people weren't used to that sort of

3433.92 --> 3436.16
thing

3443.52 --> 3449.28
well now everybody's been born in this

3446.96 --> 3451.2
for generations and

3449.28 --> 3454.2400000000002
we've yeah the people that have been

3451.2 --> 3456.16
born post-information revolution

3454.24 --> 3458.16
which is the internet pretty much when

3456.16 --> 3461.52
that really got bigger

3458.16 --> 3465.2799999999997
that did so much you know it's

3461.52 --> 3467.52
like they poo poo it like conspiracy

3465.28 --> 3470.48
theories videos they poo-poo it and they

3467.52 --> 3473.68
even now plan all kinds of [ __ ]

3470.48 --> 3475.44
very really dumb stuff in there but

3473.68 --> 3477.04
yeah just because officially it's

3475.44 --> 3479.52
poo-pooed it

3477.04 --> 3481.04
it doesn't mean that it didn't have

3479.52 --> 3485.44
massive

3481.04 --> 3487.359
massive uncontrolled impact

3485.44 --> 3489.04
it was counter-social engineering

3487.359 --> 3491.44
basically

3489.04 --> 3492.799
it had a massive impact and it's not

3491.44 --> 3495.839
talked about

3492.799 --> 3496.72
how much impact it all actually made on

3495.839 --> 3498.64
people

3496.72 --> 3501.1189999999997
how much it raised the entire conscious

3498.64 --> 3503.7599999999998
how people because of that

3501.119 --> 3505.52
have had opportunities to really start

3503.76 --> 3508.1600000000003
to work against

3505.52 --> 3510.72
the socially engineered society that was

3508.16 --> 3514.3999999999996
laid out for them by the controllers

3510.72 --> 3517.4399999999996
by the the super mega banks and all that

3514.4 --> 3519.839
social engineers

3517.44 --> 3521.04
so they downplay it how much influence

3519.839 --> 3523.92
that had and now

3521.04 --> 3526.72
these days yeah it's already spread out

3523.92 --> 3529.28
but because those things were there

3526.72 --> 3530.0
we are now in an information revolution

3529.28 --> 3533.28
pretty much and there

3530.0 --> 3537.2
are yeah flat earthers around

3533.28 --> 3540.2400000000002
and yeah

3537.2 --> 3543.359
people that want to change society

3540.24 --> 3545.52
figure out something better not being

3543.359 --> 3548.64
led by mega corporations and

3545.52 --> 3550.72
yeah autocrats and they

3548.64 --> 3553.04
actually know a little bit better on how

3550.72 --> 3555.5989999999997
to potentially achieve it and things

3553.04 --> 3556.96
the technology has grown with it and

3555.599 --> 3560.2000000000003
made everything all

3556.96 --> 3564.0
very viable to be decentralized

3560.2 --> 3566.96
self-sufficiency is

3564.0 --> 3568.799
greatly increased by the technology the

3566.96 --> 3571.68
the potential the options for it

3568.799 --> 3574.88
greatly increased by the technology so

3571.68 --> 3578.48
the opportunities are all here

3574.88 --> 3579.599
to literally escape the socially

3578.48 --> 3582.4
engineered

3579.599 --> 3582.4
society

3582.64 --> 3586.0
but at the same time they are pushing

3584.64 --> 3588.72
out more control than ever

3586.0 --> 3589.839
and in certain ways they're counting on

3588.72 --> 3592.64
people and

3589.839 --> 3594.0
people that are that just don't feel

3592.64 --> 3597.1189999999997
they can't handle it that

3594.0 --> 3600.64
have that feel that they must rely upon

3597.119 --> 3603.119
a collective system

3600.64 --> 3605.5989999999997
and they try to actively keep them

3603.119 --> 3607.44
depressed so they don't

3605.599 --> 3611.04
step out of it so they don't find the

3607.44 --> 3614.48
courage that happens

3611.04 --> 3618.24
and sometimes people even do it just

3614.48 --> 3618.2400000000002
automatically it is like a cult

3618.4 --> 3623.04
we see this among extreme liberals a lot

3623.119 --> 3629.44
but it happens everywhere

3626.16 --> 3633.839
among like globe believers this happens

3629.44 --> 3636.96
as well and

3633.839 --> 3639.04
even in the smaller scale

3636.96 --> 3641.04
you know with details like in flat

3639.04 --> 3642.5589999999997
earthers in ways still have it too

3641.04 --> 3647.2799999999997
although we're

3642.559 --> 3650.3190000000004
we will very much respond

3647.28 --> 3652.799
when we're addressed upon such typical

3650.319 --> 3654.48
behavior

3652.799 --> 3656.079
but it happens to everyone because

3654.48 --> 3659.68
especially the more strenuous

3656.079 --> 3661.6800000000003
things are the more you will typically

3659.68 --> 3664.319
just want to respond in a

3661.68 --> 3666.5589999999997
universally automated way because that

3664.319 --> 3668.079
seems the safest that seems to have the

3666.559 --> 3671.599
broadest

3668.079 --> 3674.079
range of understanding and

3671.599 --> 3675.92
you won't have to break your head over

3674.079 --> 3680.48
it while you're already under stress

3675.92 --> 3683.04
so even flat earthers some of them

3680.48 --> 3684.0
some more than others they do this

3683.04 --> 3687.2799999999997
because every

3684.0 --> 3690.88
almost everybody does this

3687.28 --> 3693.599
just some point like oh no just go with

3690.88 --> 3694.319
more bland the more general just fall

3693.599 --> 3696.48
back

3694.319 --> 3698.5589999999997
and in their minds they'll be but but i

3696.48 --> 3699.44
am not going along with that and that

3698.559 --> 3702.6400000000003
and that

3699.44 --> 3705.359
but i will now fall back on

3702.64 --> 3708.48
a side arm that i'm going to imagine is

3705.359 --> 3713.839
not directly linked to that whole thing

3708.48 --> 3713.839
and people do that

3714.079 --> 3720.7200000000003
i do that but i'm much more aware of it

3718.079 --> 3721.76
like yeah i'm having a lot of talk a lot

3720.72 --> 3724.0789999999997
of ideas

3721.76 --> 3725.44
at the same time i'm on social welfare

3724.079 --> 3729.2000000000003
now that's going

3725.44 --> 3731.44
decently it's

3729.2 --> 3732.799
it's not as problematic as one would

3731.44 --> 3736.2400000000002
think

3732.799 --> 3739.599
but but it

3736.24 --> 3742.72
is like

3739.599 --> 3746.0
it is one of the tentacles it might be a

3742.72 --> 3749.52
less stinky smelly tentacle

3746.0 --> 3750.039
because it's actually helping me or but

3749.52 --> 3753.119
yeah

3750.039 --> 3754.4
symptomatically helping me but it is

3753.119 --> 3756.88
part of the tentacle and i

3754.4 --> 3757.76
realized that i realized that every time

3756.88 --> 3761.119
every

3757.76 --> 3763.5200000000004
single time it's not very pleasant

3761.119 --> 3765.359
but then yeah what tentacle am i gonna

3763.52 --> 3766.72
reach out to because i gotta get money

3765.359 --> 3769.0389999999998
somewhere right

3766.72 --> 3770.0
unless i just want to drop everything i

3769.039 --> 3772.4
have and flee

3770.0 --> 3773.28
into the woods and try to build a cabin

3772.4 --> 3775.839
for myself

3773.28 --> 3778.559
somehow and hope i don't die of

3775.839 --> 3778.5589999999997
pneumonia

3778.799 --> 3784.88
so yeah

3782.319 --> 3787.0389999999998
that's the package i'm at you know

3784.88 --> 3789.039
despite all principles you gotta survive

3787.039 --> 3792.96
somehow

3789.039 --> 3795.119
so what do we do with all this

3792.96 --> 3796.0
when it's all tied into everything

3795.119 --> 3799.2000000000003
everything is tied

3796.0 --> 3801.68
into everything there's no escape

3799.2 --> 3803.839
not really it's only escape if you

3801.68 --> 3805.7599999999998
really build up to it

3803.839 --> 3807.839
and then you find the courage to

3805.76 --> 3809.6800000000003
actually escape

3807.839 --> 3812.0789999999997
well guess what most people that build

3809.68 --> 3815.7599999999998
up to it to escape

3812.079 --> 3818.559
then realize whoa i got all this power

3815.76 --> 3822.0
building up and then they don't escape

3818.559 --> 3822.0
and they become part of the system

3822.839 --> 3839.839
yeah that happens a lot

3826.72 --> 3839.839
a whole lot

3843.92 --> 3850.2400000000002
right so yeah in order

3847.2 --> 3851.7599999999998
to prevent that the best thing

3850.24 --> 3853.7599999999998
i would recommend and that i'm

3851.76 --> 3857.76
recommending for myself

3853.76 --> 3860.079
is just focus on simple

3857.76 --> 3861.119
things that are logos that that will

3860.079 --> 3862.799
yield

3861.119 --> 3864.4
you know you have to be productive

3862.799 --> 3865.0389999999998
somehow but that doesn't mean you have

3864.4 --> 3869.44
to be

3865.039 --> 3869.44
productive by society's standards

3872.0 --> 3875.28
by anybody else's you have to just be

3874.24 --> 3878.0789999999997
productive

3875.28 --> 3878.079
in some way

3878.4 --> 3884.7200000000003
food good ideas courage

3881.839 --> 3884.72
morality

3885.44 --> 3895.839
information there's all kinds of things

3888.88 --> 3895.839
you can produce that are good

3904.799 --> 3908.96
yeah martin telberg but there you go if

3907.28 --> 3910.1600000000003
you know the system very well you can

3908.96 --> 3914.96
hack it own it

3910.16 --> 3914.96
yeah own it you say

3915.119 --> 3923.119
you know what that's classified as right

3921.92 --> 3926.079
yeah you can

3923.119 --> 3926.079
but should you

3927.039 --> 3931.119
you know just because you found an

3928.88 --> 3932.079
exploit in a corrupted system does that

3931.119 --> 3933.92
mean that

3932.079 --> 3935.3590000000004
you should then support that system

3933.92 --> 3938.48
because you found a way

3935.359 --> 3938.48
to abuse it

3941.68 --> 3946.0789999999997
if that will eventually perpetuate the

3944.0 --> 3949.28
system

3946.079 --> 3951.039
that is just not working great except

3949.28 --> 3952.079
for you in that moment when you figure

3951.039 --> 3965.8390000000004
out how to

3952.079 --> 3965.8390000000004
exploit it

3976.839 --> 3979.839
hmm

3985.599 --> 3988.96
hmm yeah that's a that's an

3987.52 --> 3992.03
old-fashioned one

3988.96 --> 3995.139
i agree with that

3992.03 --> 3995.139
[Music]

4004.839 --> 4007.839
hmm

4018.16 --> 4023.7599999999998
hmm a man like me i don't know not all

4020.72 --> 4023.7599999999998
people are greedy

4028.319 --> 4034.24
it's the problem is is that if you

4030.559 --> 4036.88
become good at making money

4034.24 --> 4040.319
then your ego can latch onto that and

4036.88 --> 4042.88
that is kind of what greed is

4040.319 --> 4042.88
it's like

4044.0 --> 4048.079
yeah the the spiritual yeah what when he

4047.2 --> 4050.8799999999997
called spiritual

4048.079 --> 4050.88
reward even

4051.28 --> 4058.0
karmic reward getting more

4054.72 --> 4061.0389999999998
yeah that can definitely

4058.0 --> 4062.4
get you like obsessed with it you want

4061.039 --> 4064.6400000000003
more

4062.4 --> 4066.48
like oh you got more okay then you want

4064.64 --> 4069.6299999999997
even more

4066.48 --> 4069.63
[Music]

4073.599 --> 4077.839
all right

4079.359 --> 4084.0
extrapolate that to quantum mechanics

4081.68 --> 4084.0
what

4085.839 --> 4091.839
you cannot observe something without

4087.76 --> 4091.8390000000004
affecting it

4102.839 --> 4106.5599999999995
maybe i don't know

4110.799 --> 4114.239
there's no way to test it

4115.199 --> 4118.48
because the only way to test whether it

4117.12 --> 4122.159
is

4118.48 --> 4125.44
affecting something is by detection

4122.159 --> 4133.839
by recording by observing so i think

4125.44 --> 4133.839
that's untestable

4144.839 --> 4147.839
okay

4149.839 --> 4157.199
well the only way to test

4154.4 --> 4158.159
or to figure out to be certain whether

4157.199 --> 4161.44
something is

4158.159 --> 4165.75
influenced by something is

4161.44 --> 4168.938999999999
through observation so that is literally

4165.75 --> 4168.939
[Music]

4172.839 --> 4175.839
untestable

4190.239 --> 4194.718999999999
all right now on the other hand if you

4192.239 --> 4199.678999999999
could literally prove

4194.719 --> 4199.679
how something is altered by observing it

4200.8 --> 4208.400000000001
that would be interesting now

4204.96 --> 4208.96
you could say that the knowing which

4208.4 --> 4211.759999999999
path

4208.96 --> 4213.28
experiment in quantum mechanics would be

4211.76 --> 4216.56
the proof of that

4213.28 --> 4217.5199999999995
but that's kind of cheating because

4216.56 --> 4220.0
that's not

4217.52 --> 4221.120000000001
really yeah that's not a normal

4220.0 --> 4224.0
situation that's

4221.12 --> 4226.64
kind of a man-made device to me like the

4224.0 --> 4229.84
phenomenon isn't probably

4226.64 --> 4231.679
but yeah if it really counted for

4229.84 --> 4232.64
something like okay really it affects

4231.679 --> 4235.28
something

4232.64 --> 4237.4400000000005
then there should be some residue there

4235.28 --> 4238.5599999999995
should be an alteration that could be

4237.44 --> 4244.239
measured

4238.56 --> 4247.360000000001
so it should be tested

4244.239 --> 4247.36
but yeah how do you even

4249.12 --> 4252.88
isolate it you know because is literally

4252.08 --> 4256.64
observing

4252.88 --> 4259.4400000000005
something the influence or is the

4256.64 --> 4263.84
concentration and focus of people

4259.44 --> 4263.839999999999
observing something is that an influence

4266.32 --> 4269.599999999999
because i'm pretty sure that focus of

4268.719 --> 4272.719
people does

4269.6 --> 4275.52
influence just like prayer so

4272.719 --> 4276.4800000000005
for example just not don't take this

4275.52 --> 4278.2390000000005
literal

4276.48 --> 4282.4
who knows maybe this has been done or

4278.239 --> 4287.678999999999
something like i'd imagine that

4282.4 --> 4291.12
an apple in a glass box

4287.679 --> 4294.4800000000005
would probably stay

4291.12 --> 4297.92
as it is wouldn't spoil

4294.48 --> 4300.4
for a longer time than if that same box

4297.92 --> 4301.36
were surrounded by people that would all

4300.4 --> 4304.48
focus on it

4301.36 --> 4307.5199999999995
and just imagine like

4304.48 --> 4310.159
it rotting in their minds and just

4307.52 --> 4313.6
be there for very long time focusing on

4310.159 --> 4315.679
that while staring at the same apple

4313.6 --> 4316.88
right i think that would probably cause

4315.679 --> 4321.679
the apple to rot

4316.88 --> 4325.679
quicker even though it is a completely

4321.679 --> 4329.84
closed system or uh

4325.679 --> 4329.84
yeah yeah closed system

4331.04 --> 4335.84
air wise you know i think that

4334.4 --> 4337.44
but because then it's not the

4335.84 --> 4338.88
observation

4337.44 --> 4340.5599999999995
you know if you're going to do the same

4338.88 --> 4342.400000000001
thing with cameras just have all these

4340.56 --> 4343.92
cameras hanging over it

4342.4 --> 4347.44
that's probably not going to influence

4343.92 --> 4347.4400000000005
it so i don't know

4349.6 --> 4352.719
it's not really the point of the remark

4351.84 --> 4354.8
you made but

4352.719 --> 4356.719
it did make me think again like oh yeah

4354.8 --> 4359.1990000000005
observation influences something yeah

4356.719 --> 4362.44
how about conscious focus

4359.199 --> 4366.5599999999995
you know it's much more

4362.44 --> 4371.839999999999
influenceable influencing

4366.56 --> 4371.84
than just literal perception

4373.12 --> 4376.88
i think focus conscious focus probably

4375.6 --> 4379.6
the spirit of it

4376.88 --> 4381.04
that probably causes a lot more

4379.6 --> 4384.08
influence

4381.04 --> 4399.84
than literally the mechanical perception

4384.08 --> 4399.84
of something

4414.64 --> 4418.2390000000005
yeah yeah more colored indeed

4424.0 --> 4431.04
well science isn't alive

4427.04 --> 4431.04
so it can't classify things

4432.719 --> 4434.96
but

4436.0 --> 4440.32
i get the point yeah pseudoscience will

4439.52 --> 4442.8
definitely

4440.32 --> 4443.759999999999
declare any serious signs as

4442.8 --> 4446.62
pseudoscience

4443.76 --> 4449.7390000000005
that's what it's there for

4446.62 --> 4449.739
[Music]

4457.28 --> 4461.92
that's all right i'm just being nitpicky

4465.12 --> 4468.88
well to assume your consciousness

4467.199 --> 4469.599999999999
affects things well it is not just

4468.88 --> 4472.8
conscious it's

4469.6 --> 4475.6
conscious attention see

4472.8 --> 4476.64
and now now you hear the word conscious

4475.6 --> 4479.52
attention

4476.64 --> 4482.719
and suddenly that word just probably

4479.52 --> 4485.120000000001
will trigger a whole variety of things

4482.719 --> 4485.76
that you've heard of before like hey

4485.12 --> 4488.96
keep

4485.76 --> 4493.679
giving people conscious attention

4488.96 --> 4497.76
you know all that yeah it matters a lot

4493.679 --> 4501.1990000000005
and there's literally a just a

4497.76 --> 4504.08
unexplained thing that happens an energy

4501.199 --> 4505.28
exchange like a vis a physical

4504.08 --> 4508.719
experience with that

4505.28 --> 4511.36
even that it does

4508.719 --> 4512.719
and yeah you can get all descriptive and

4511.36 --> 4514.639999999999
esoteric on it

4512.719 --> 4516.32
but that's basically what's going on

4514.64 --> 4519.1990000000005
there is a physical

4516.32 --> 4521.44
effect happening because of conscious

4519.199 --> 4525.5199999999995
attention

4521.44 --> 4528.879999999999
hey and even like provably tasks

4525.52 --> 4530.96
just tasks any tasks like especially a

4528.88 --> 4532.96
little bit more complicated tasks

4530.96 --> 4534.32
have somebody that just not interest

4532.96 --> 4538.88
they know how to do it they're not

4534.32 --> 4541.44
interested do it and then have somebody

4538.88 --> 4543.76
that also knows how to do that really in

4541.44 --> 4545.44
for doing it

4543.76 --> 4547.360000000001
that's definitely going to concentrate

4545.44 --> 4549.678999999999
well you already know who's going to do

4547.36 --> 4553.5199999999995
a better job

4549.679 --> 4556.64
why because of conscious attention

4553.52 --> 4559.84
it matters it's literally it

4556.64 --> 4564.0
yeah whether however

4559.84 --> 4567.12
you explain the route of the improvement

4564.0 --> 4570.32
or the influence there is this influence

4567.12 --> 4572.08
one way or the other and the path

4570.32 --> 4574.799999999999
of this influence is almost kind of

4572.08 --> 4576.4
elusive if you try to isolate it as a

4574.8 --> 4581.84
phenomenon

4576.4 --> 4581.839999999999
but it's definitely there

4587.199 --> 4591.678999999999
their conscious attention is dangerous

4589.44 --> 4592.96
well that's what they want to think

4591.679 --> 4596.56
that's what they believe that's what

4592.96 --> 4596.56
they project unto themselves

4596.96 --> 4601.12
you know they look all these trolls they

4600.32 --> 4604.32
think they're all

4601.12 --> 4604.96
just a bunch of james bond people or

4604.32 --> 4608.32
something

4604.96 --> 4610.8
either villains or like

4608.32 --> 4611.5199999999995
the secret good guy that's supposed to

4610.8 --> 4613.6
stop him

4611.52 --> 4614.88
and then just by agitating him because

4613.6 --> 4616.8
they're on hostile grounds

4614.88 --> 4620.08
so you know people get guided by all

4616.8 --> 4620.08
kinds of fantastical

4620.84 --> 4627.4400000000005
yeah feelings and ideas of

4625.12 --> 4628.4
what it's like to do that what they do

4627.44 --> 4630.08
instead of

4628.4 --> 4632.0
just seeing it for what it really is

4630.08 --> 4633.76
trolling

4632.0 --> 4635.52
yeah they get inspired in all kinds of

4633.76 --> 4636.0
ways and they think they can influence

4635.52 --> 4639.040000000001
but yeah

4636.0 --> 4641.44
it's it's a two-way street you can't

4639.04 --> 4643.6
literally influence another person

4641.44 --> 4651.28
unless they're open for it

4643.6 --> 4654.159000000001
you know it's two-way street when it

4651.28 --> 4654.159
comes to people

4656.159 --> 4660.5599999999995
conscious attention can be ignored

4663.6 --> 4679.84
are deflected

4680.56 --> 4683.92

4682.56 --> 4685.679

4683.92 --> 4687.52

4685.679 --> 4691.679
pretty good show

4687.52 --> 4694.159000000001
