so yeah the weather today is quite a

76.159 --> 82.24000000000001
contrast

77.52 --> 82.24
again seems to be going back and forth

82.64 --> 87.43900000000001
but now it's yeah the clouds seem a

85.28 --> 100.24000000000001
little thicker

87.439 --> 102.55999999999999
it's a little windy too

100.24 --> 102.55999999999999
all right

111.439 --> 120.399
right so let's see who's in chat so far

116.479 --> 123.36
ah roger it's first terrett 306

120.399 --> 123.36
daniel field

123.52 --> 126.88
do i have lunch and then do the show no

126.399 --> 130.64
no

126.88 --> 133.599
i uh i never really do it like that

130.64 --> 133.599
there were three or six

134.319 --> 143.83999999999997
usually i have lunch right after or

137.68 --> 143.84
like somewhere halfway flatter debates

147.92 --> 152.39999999999998
now if i also go for lunch before the

151.36 --> 154.959
show then

152.4 --> 157.84
it's probably not yeah then i'll be late

154.959 --> 157.84
a lot

160.64 --> 163.83999999999997
but also i've noticed on average that if

163.44 --> 166.879
i've

163.84 --> 170.0
if i'm very gratified from eating

166.879 --> 173.92
i usually have less

170.0 --> 178.159
uh i get less talky

173.92 --> 180.159
so i wait a little with that and just

178.159 --> 184.39999999999998
but i'm not really hungry when i start

180.159 --> 187.92
the show i rarely am because

184.4 --> 189.519
i had coffee i had well a pile of

187.92 --> 192.48
supplements

189.519 --> 195.36
and i'm not that hungry right after i

192.48 --> 195.35999999999999
get up anyway

196.959 --> 202.08
right after i get up it's like it's an

200.159 --> 203.84
hour after i've gotten up pretty much at

202.08 --> 206.4
this moment

203.84 --> 207.92000000000002
but yeah it usually takes some time

206.4 --> 213.20000000000002
before i

207.92 --> 217.76
get a little hungry

213.2 --> 217.76
right hey here we go again

218.0 --> 220.64
so yeah

221.519 --> 224.64000000000001
i was also a little late because i was

223.36 --> 227.84
watching back

224.64 --> 227.83999999999997
my show from yesterday

228.0 --> 233.599
because i'm almost sorry i didn't watch

229.68 --> 236.72
it back i kind of wanted to but i forgot

233.599 --> 240.07999999999998
because yesterday was i was in a very

236.72 --> 241.68
introspective mood and yeah then i

240.08 --> 245.43900000000002
listened back part of it and it was

241.68 --> 245.439
actually it was interesting to listen at

246.159 --> 252.56
so i got yeah i'm late because i was

248.48 --> 252.56
watching my own show basically this is

253.28 --> 259.28
uh hey zach

256.639 --> 259.28000000000003
good to see you

260.079 --> 265.6
all right let's see what notes oh no i

262.72 --> 269.84000000000003
forgot the notes again didn't i

265.6 --> 269.84000000000003
i did no wait i didn't huh

272.72 --> 276.40000000000003
but i should have probably made more

274.08 --> 276.4
notes

280.479 --> 283.59999999999997
because anyway well yeah yesterday

282.479 --> 288.08
flutter debate

283.6 --> 290.47900000000004
uh flat earth early bird was pretty good

288.08 --> 291.52
apparently it was very introspective i

290.479 --> 293.919
watched back i

291.52 --> 295.919
i couldn't step away as i might actually

293.919 --> 296.479
continue watching that after the show or

295.919 --> 299.12
something

296.479 --> 301.039
like that maybe i won't be in the mood

299.12 --> 305.52
anymore

301.039 --> 308.639
uh and owen benjamin was live also

305.52 --> 312.96
somewhere and

308.639 --> 312.96000000000004
that was just really good really funny

314.32 --> 318.15999999999997
and it was very dynamic with piano and

316.8 --> 321.28000000000003
everything

318.16 --> 324.24
oh man at some point he just somebody

321.28 --> 327.84
kept demanding this song

324.24 --> 328.96000000000004
and like oh yeah big bear was getting a

327.84 --> 332.0
little frustrated

328.96 --> 333.44
with that because like

332.0 --> 335.199
yeah the person demanding it was

333.44 --> 336.96
apparently a little pushy about it so he

335.199 --> 340.479
looked it up played it

336.96 --> 341.919
and it was kind of like it wasn't on the

340.479 --> 344.24
big bear frequency

341.919 --> 345.35999999999996
it like there was something off about it

344.24 --> 348.96000000000004
like it had a little

345.36 --> 352.639
bit of a gay gravel feel to it

348.96 --> 355.12
slightly but then he played it anyway

352.639 --> 356.96000000000004
and then eventually like got kind of

355.12 --> 358.4
sick of it

356.96 --> 360.08
because he just really did it as a

358.4 --> 362.63899999999995
request and then i was like

360.08 --> 364.639
okay like you gotta do voices with this

362.639 --> 365.6
[Â __Â ] and i just kept hearing bob dylan

364.639 --> 367.28000000000003
in my head but i

365.6 --> 368.639
i couldn't think of the name so i was

367.28 --> 370.96
like oh my g

368.639 --> 373.28000000000003
like oh i want to say the name like do

370.96 --> 375.52
it in bob dylan style but it

373.28 --> 377.44
spent like a minute really frustrated

375.52 --> 379.52
because i couldn't remember the name

377.44 --> 380.71999999999997
nobody was talking about it so it was

379.52 --> 383.35999999999996
like

380.72 --> 384.319
but then i got it and he did it like

383.36 --> 386.96000000000004
right away

384.319 --> 389.44
he and my god it was so funny it just

386.96 --> 394.08
couldn't stop laughing

389.44 --> 397.199
that was awesome that moment

394.08 --> 399.35999999999996
ah so yeah had a really good laugh over

397.199 --> 403.84000000000003
at big bear

399.36 --> 403.84000000000003
that's just really funny to me

407.52 --> 411.28
and it's really like it's really an

409.599 --> 414.24
admirable skill to just be

411.28 --> 415.28
good at music and dynamic and mix it in

414.24 --> 418.56
with comedy

415.28 --> 423.84
on a whim like that it's it's just

418.56 --> 423.84
it's something else

430.479 --> 436.56
like real old bardic stuff in a way i

433.759 --> 439.199
imagine sometimes like in the medieval

436.56 --> 441.28000000000003
times whatever they were really like

439.199 --> 443.599
that bart's would try to do that sort of

441.28 --> 447.039
stuff too it's like yeah the good music

443.599 --> 451.84
and then they just start mixing in

447.039 --> 451.84
silly jokes or being silly characters

452.56 --> 457.919
and yeah especially if yeah if it was

455.36 --> 458.47900000000004
like a barden an anti-authority type

457.919 --> 461.44
bard

458.479 --> 462.56
and it probably were out there a lot

461.44 --> 465.199
yeah that would

462.56 --> 468.96
it's just it gives me this feel of like

465.199 --> 468.96000000000004
this medieval bard sometimes

474.08 --> 479.84
and in a way i think that's probably

476.0 --> 479.84
what he's aiming for as well

480.16 --> 486.24
but yeah that was good stuff uh

484.72 --> 488.8
i also caught a bit of a bible

486.24 --> 493.84000000000003
literalist but it i was late so i

488.8 --> 493.84000000000003
didn't really see it

495.44 --> 501.52
also there was this just another

499.039 --> 503.919
odd but interesting interview from mark

501.52 --> 506.71999999999997
sargent with this

503.919 --> 508.71999999999997
12 year old brazilian kid that did his

506.72 --> 511.28000000000003
own show in brazil

508.72 --> 512.24
in brazilian which is like portuguese i

511.28 --> 515.68
think

512.24 --> 518.0
and that was

515.68 --> 520.0799999999999
interesting and odd to listen to too i

518.0 --> 524.159
didn't watch the whole thing but

520.08 --> 524.159
like it was only a sound

524.72 --> 533.12
uh yeah that's it kind of sporadic

529.839 --> 535.0400000000001
after the own benjamin thing and

533.12 --> 537.279
oh yeah i went to bed really early this

535.04 --> 537.279
time

538.16 --> 542.3199999999999
oh really every time i say really it's

540.16 --> 544.3199999999999
still not before 12

542.32 --> 545.44
because that should be early it's not

544.32 --> 548.48
for me i'm

545.44 --> 553.6
it's winter time i'm always late

548.48 --> 553.6
i'm always up late it happens every time

554.08 --> 559.6
it's almost like my time consciousness

556.16 --> 559.6
just shifts a few hours

560.24 --> 565.279
and then when springtime hits it usually

562.48 --> 565.279
shifts back

565.519 --> 571.76
and then i get like this real urges

567.68 --> 571.76
early in the morning to get very active

572.08 --> 576.08
but yeah that's that's that time isn't

575.2 --> 579.839
there yet

576.08 --> 579.839
still going to be a few months probably

580.72 --> 583.44
as in two

584.399 --> 591.839
right so how are you all doing

597.04 --> 602.64
yeah zack yeah here we go again is great

599.839 --> 605.2
and you're all great

602.64 --> 606.88
and you're all improving and it's it's a

605.2 --> 607.6800000000001
real pleasure to have you around in my

606.88 --> 610.32
chat

607.68 --> 611.5999999999999
because i think that you guys really you

610.32 --> 614.6400000000001
get it you get

611.6 --> 618.0790000000001
what this show is how i work

614.64 --> 619.36
kind of what i like and you realize that

618.079 --> 622.4799999999999
i'm

619.36 --> 623.36
trying to be amusing as well like being

622.48 --> 626.5600000000001
entertaining is

623.36 --> 629.839
is still an important thing

626.56 --> 630.7199999999999
you know because yeah i have two hours a

629.839 --> 632.48
day and

630.72 --> 634.88
if i don't manage to keep it

632.48 --> 636.72
entertaining somehow then i'm gonna get

634.88 --> 639.76
stuck

636.72 --> 647.2
feel bad about it and then that's not

639.76 --> 651.36
so just gotta keep it rolling

647.2 --> 651.36
but yeah a lot of you here are great

658.32 --> 664.9590000000001
and yeah the recent month especially

661.519 --> 667.6
is also just new people that

664.959 --> 668.88
there's like two types two types of

667.6 --> 671.76
engagements and i

668.88 --> 672.48
myself also can be classified within

671.76 --> 674.079
them

672.48 --> 675.9200000000001
and that's just the people that are

674.079 --> 678.959
there to absorb

675.92 --> 680.64
and apply

678.959 --> 684.16
and then there's people that have their

680.64 --> 686.16
own like idea responses

684.16 --> 687.36
and what's his name again the steamy

686.16 --> 690.3199999999999
traveler is like is

687.36 --> 691.6800000000001
particularly one of those that just

690.32 --> 695.279
comes in

691.68 --> 698.8
and really has like management

695.279 --> 701.68
ideas live that's

698.8 --> 702.959
kind of how i like ideas on like this

701.68 --> 705.519
would be good if

702.959 --> 706.16
he would address this and the funny

705.519 --> 709.68
thing is

706.16 --> 711.8389999999999
i do that too that's my modus that's

709.68 --> 713.519
like how i typically do thing i watch a

711.839 --> 715.519
show if it's live

713.519 --> 718.079
i kind of try to get involved but in a

715.519 --> 722.079
good way and not to be like

718.079 --> 724.079
attention crabby but to say like oh

722.079 --> 726.56
this would be great like i want to hand

724.079 --> 728.2399999999999
over good ideas

726.56 --> 730.6389999999999
because for some reason when i'm not

728.24 --> 733.6
doing the show myself

730.639 --> 734.16
and i'm just watching then i don't have

733.6 --> 735.9200000000001
the

734.16 --> 738.24
burden of basically having all these

735.92 --> 739.1999999999999
eyes on me that's on to the one having

738.24 --> 741.2
the show

739.2 --> 742.88
and then it gives all this extra room

741.2 --> 745.12
for just

742.88 --> 746.48
that part of figuring out what to do

745.12 --> 748.32
next

746.48 --> 750.16
without the burden and then i try to

748.32 --> 751.7600000000001
contribute that

750.16 --> 753.279
and that's like typically something that

751.76 --> 755.279
i do and i know people

753.279 --> 757.2
absolutely know that about me because it

755.279 --> 761.6
always happens

757.2 --> 763.12
i've done it in every type of show

761.6 --> 764.8000000000001
like before i joined the flat earth

763.12 --> 766.16
debates i was then on the flight of the

764.8 --> 770.4799999999999
bay chat

766.16 --> 772.56
every time right at least i tried

770.48 --> 774.639
during things like when patricia stare

772.56 --> 778.079
went live

774.639 --> 780.5600000000001
typically do that and even in places

778.079 --> 781.4399999999999
yeah before i just got outright banned

780.56 --> 783.68
every time

781.44 --> 784.72
over at globus i did that i always do

783.68 --> 788.079
that

784.72 --> 790.399
and sometimes it gets technical i might

788.079 --> 792.8
take an opposition like okay i'm

790.399 --> 794.959
a safe competitor i'm going to compete

792.8 --> 798.3199999999999
with your idea i'm going to

794.959 --> 799.4399999999999
counter-argue it but from a gentlemanly

798.32 --> 801.6
perspective

799.44 --> 802.72
so that you have something you can

801.6 --> 804.48
oppose i do

802.72 --> 806.88
that too like when it gets technical

804.48 --> 810.639
when it's like typically flat earth

806.88 --> 812.88
because competition is something that's

810.639 --> 814.0
that is kind of whether we like it or

812.88 --> 818.079
not an integral part

814.0 --> 820.72
of yeah dealing with the physics and the

818.079 --> 820.7199999999999
mechanics

823.44 --> 829.12
a lot of people are kind of driven by it

826.56 --> 831.5189999999999
it keeps them awake it keeps them active

829.12 --> 835.12
it keeps them paying attention

831.519 --> 837.519
so then yeah safe competition like gen

835.12 --> 839.36
like on good on good behavioral

837.519 --> 842.8
standards and all that

839.36 --> 845.36
is helpful to provide

842.8 --> 847.199
so i do that too and i even try to do it

845.36 --> 850.5600000000001
in the flat earth debates

847.199 --> 852.88
by being sort of acting like a baller

850.56 --> 855.1199999999999
and then acting a little bit more like a

852.88 --> 857.92
baller than most would

855.12 --> 857.92
because i can

861.36 --> 866.8000000000001
but other people do it too and

864.399 --> 867.76
yeah it's great to have those people

866.8 --> 869.3599999999999
around

867.76 --> 871.279
they're not always around though they

869.36 --> 873.12
don't have to be

871.279 --> 874.959
and it's those people that keep on

873.12 --> 876.48
saying things and then everybody starts

874.959 --> 879.279
rolling in chat too

876.48 --> 880.72
because when i'm just talking especially

879.279 --> 884.0
getting introspective

880.72 --> 886.1600000000001
and explaining then a lot of people also

884.0 --> 888.0
tend to just stand still and i know i

886.16 --> 890.56
know they're just not typing because

888.0 --> 892.48
they're listening they're zoning in

890.56 --> 894.8
but at the same time yeah that also kind

892.48 --> 897.44
of stop the chat

894.8 --> 898.0
so it's a bit complicated i still have

897.44 --> 901.2790000000001
to figure

898.0 --> 912.079
out like how to properly deal with this

901.279 --> 914.32
but it's all good it's all natural

912.079 --> 914.3199999999999
right

916.56 --> 930.959
let's get some tea

926.94 --> 933.12
[Music]

930.959 --> 935.3599999999999
right now i remember i've been watching

933.12 --> 937.6
south park again

935.36 --> 939.44
man there's some real prophetic [Â __Â ] in

937.6 --> 944.0
there it's

939.44 --> 947.44
like in ways we couldn't have seen even

944.0 --> 950.88
like there's like comedy

947.44 --> 953.6
prophecy in there it's you

950.88 --> 954.16
probably might have felt it but if you

953.6 --> 958.0790000000001
would

954.16 --> 960.8
realize how much it's crazy

958.079 --> 961.519
like these guys been really on top of

960.8 --> 965.68
like on the

961.519 --> 968.9590000000001
the very tippy top of the wave

965.68 --> 970.3199999999999
like they've been pushing it big time

968.959 --> 972.4799999999999
and successfully

970.32 --> 973.6
and it's just i'm now watching through

972.48 --> 977.36
season

973.6 --> 978.16
four into five also approaching the 911

977.36 --> 980.839
point

978.16 --> 982.399
and it was really interesting to watch

980.839 --> 984.72
like

982.399 --> 986.639
where the consciousness was at because

984.72 --> 989.9300000000001
south park is always trying to

986.639 --> 991.12
push that frontline consciousness

989.93 --> 995.4399999999999
[Music]

991.12 --> 998.88
like being so straightforward so raw

995.44 --> 1002.8800000000001
and just actual human

998.88 --> 1006.24
like the shameful honest human being

1002.88 --> 1008.079
and to see that consciousness shift

1006.24 --> 1010.0
because of what the events that

1008.079 --> 1012.399
transpired like where everybody was

1010.0 --> 1015.36
at what they were struggling with the

1012.399 --> 1017.6
psychological warfare at the time

1015.36 --> 1018.5600000000001
and then like how it changed and i could

1017.6 --> 1021.44
really i could

1018.56 --> 1022.2399999999999
feel that so yeah watching south park to

1021.44 --> 1028.079
me is like

1022.24 --> 1028.079
whoa dude it's heavy to watch it again

1031.6 --> 1039.839
so yeah i've been watching that let's

1048.24 --> 1053.84
hey daniel field

1056.64 --> 1060.4
if you had a small panel or have ballers

1059.919 --> 1064.8400000000001
call in

1060.4 --> 1067.76
oh god well i've i have done that in the

1064.84 --> 1070.0
past

1067.76 --> 1070.0
but

1071.039 --> 1075.2
a lot of the times it it takes me out of

1073.36 --> 1078.32
the zone

1075.2 --> 1080.4
so what i'm doing right now if i had in

1078.32 --> 1083.28
mind like i'm going to be talking with

1080.4 --> 1086.16
somebody that kind of takes me out of it

1083.28 --> 1086.16
a lot of the times

1087.2 --> 1097.44
so i kind of abandoned that

1095.039 --> 1100.16
and to me yeah i get on the flat earth

1097.44 --> 1100.16
debate so

1100.88 --> 1104.64
it's just i reserve the flat earth

1103.6 --> 1107.52
debates for

1104.64 --> 1110.0
that sort of activity and reserve my

1107.52 --> 1113.36
show more for introspective things

1110.0 --> 1116.799
because i have a lot of room in that

1113.36 --> 1117.84
things to share and skills to do it

1116.799 --> 1121.44
right

1117.84 --> 1124.9599999999998
so i'm just kind of sticking to this

1121.44 --> 1127.52
but yeah it if there might be moments

1124.96 --> 1128.0
where things flare up again in a good

1127.52 --> 1131.28
way

1128.0 --> 1132.88
hopefully that i might just get somebody

1131.28 --> 1136.96
on the show to kind of like

1132.88 --> 1140.0
bring an urgent message or something new

1136.96 --> 1142.32
and yeah but

1140.0 --> 1144.24
it hasn't really nothing really has had

1142.32 --> 1151.84
like that has happened

1144.24 --> 1151.84
for a while i think since last summer

1158.32 --> 1162.84
but once a week on your membership

1160.96 --> 1165.52
platform

1162.84 --> 1167.76
well

1165.52 --> 1167.76
uh

1168.88 --> 1171.679
i don't know yet

1176.88 --> 1180.7990000000002
what happened to so far

1182.32 --> 1187.12
well like uh that was weird

1187.28 --> 1191.44
yeah at some point the actor that played

1189.919 --> 1195.1200000000001
that voice

1191.44 --> 1198.96
he died at some point

1195.12 --> 1201.76
so then they had to sort of like

1198.96 --> 1203.3600000000001
end the chef character too and they they

1201.76 --> 1206.48
did it in a weird way where they

1203.36 --> 1212.0
used pre-recorded voice

1206.48 --> 1212.0
things as a joke that was weird man

1212.64 --> 1216.0800000000002
but i don't yeah i'm not there yet in

1214.64 --> 1218.88
the series i don't know when that

1216.08 --> 1218.8799999999999
happened exactly

1219.44 --> 1235.8400000000001
yeah well that sort of thing happens all

1221.84 --> 1235.84
the time here we go again

1242.24 --> 1251.52
i thought he quit because of scientology

1248.0 --> 1251.9
diddy i

1251.52 --> 1255.219
i

1251.9 --> 1255.219
[Music]

1259.919 --> 1266.5590000000002
well i don't know maybe you're right

1264.08 --> 1268.6399999999999
i look i'm not i haven't really done

1266.559 --> 1270.6399999999999
background research and stuff on

1268.64 --> 1274.0
southwark

1270.64 --> 1276.64
basically i guess it was a rumor

1274.0 --> 1277.2
that i thought that the the actor had

1276.64 --> 1279.5200000000002
died

1277.2 --> 1281.3600000000001
but maybe it's not true maybe what you

1279.52 --> 1283.28
say that he did quit because of

1281.36 --> 1291.84
scientology

1283.28 --> 1291.84
i don't know

1302.84 --> 1305.84
hmm

1323.679 --> 1333.8400000000001
that look dude your guess is as good as

1327.2 --> 1333.8400000000001
mine like

1334.72 --> 1339.18
yeah i would have to do a dig to figure

1337.12 --> 1341.52
that one out i could try it

1339.18 --> 1344.24
[Music]

1341.52 --> 1346.0
who knows what's going to pop up south

1344.24 --> 1347.679
park is very popular so

1346.0 --> 1350.48
there's probably going to be some stuff

1347.679 --> 1350.48
written about it

1351.81 --> 1354.8799999999999
[Music]

1359.28 --> 1375.76
yeah well chef has his own wiki

1363.2 --> 1380.64
wiki page

1375.76 --> 1380.64
let's see jesus christ that's a big page

1382.559 --> 1390.24
that's oh isak

1387.36 --> 1390.24
date hayes voice

1400.84 --> 1406.799
well

1403.44 --> 1409.3600000000001
oh right he didn't die he had suffered

1406.799 --> 1413.039
for a stroke

1409.36 --> 1417.1999999999998
and then indeed like what you said

1413.039 --> 1420.72
he didn't like the scientology thing

1417.2 --> 1424.88
man there's like a huge amount of text

1420.72 --> 1424.88
here on this wiki page that's crazy

1428.84 --> 1445.84
huh

1430.96 --> 1445.8400000000001
and let me share the chef wiki page

1446.57 --> 1449.6899999999998
[Music]

1461.6 --> 1464.0
right

1465.039 --> 1468.24
well yeah it's a character and if

1467.039 --> 1469.84
everybody knows it

1468.24 --> 1474.559
everybody's going to be thinking about

1469.84 --> 1476.3999999999999
it so it starts to lead its own life

1474.559 --> 1479.52
it really it becomes real because

1476.4 --> 1483.3600000000001
everybody needs it to be

1479.52 --> 1483.36
or because everybody's paying attention

1484.32 --> 1487.84
just becomes more important

1492.72 --> 1496.0
it's bigger than old benjamin's picture

1494.88 --> 1500.0800000000002
what

1496.0 --> 1503.2
this is okay

1500.08 --> 1504.559
well if you mean on wikipedia that's not

1503.2 --> 1507.679
surprising because

1504.559 --> 1508.24
yeah wiki is hostile towards own venue

1507.679 --> 1512.4
in space

1508.24 --> 1512.4
yeah towards owen benjamin so that's not

1512.84 --> 1515.84
surprising

1523.2 --> 1533.1200000000001
and yeah

1528.72 --> 1536.4
well zach like the wiki doesn't say that

1533.12 --> 1543.84
the guy the the voice actor of

1536.4 --> 1543.8400000000001
chef is dead or anything

1550.72 --> 1555.6000000000001
that's right it is a hit piece has been

1555.039 --> 1558.799
for

1555.6 --> 1558.799
for a long time

1559.09 --> 1563.039
[Music]

1561.2 --> 1564.4
i think it kind of happened when own

1563.039 --> 1571.84
benjamin

1564.4 --> 1571.8400000000001
like started going after the jew

1583.76 --> 1599.84
hey steamy traveler good to see you

1602.4 --> 1607.1200000000001
yeah we were just talking about south

1604.32 --> 1610.559
park and character

1607.12 --> 1610.559
because i was watching south park

1610.84 --> 1613.84
yesterday

1619.84 --> 1622.1589999999999
what

1624.96 --> 1628.24
yo buying

1629.94 --> 1633.039
[Music]

1638.84 --> 1641.84
uh

1650.72 --> 1655.84
yeah i had a question by the way zack

1652.799 --> 1655.84
are you on a mobile

1658.96 --> 1665.44
oh okay yeah well i don't really care

1662.399 --> 1668.6399999999999
for that sort of lingo anyway

1665.44 --> 1672.24
because as home benjamin has been

1668.64 --> 1677.1200000000001
explaining for some time now

1672.24 --> 1680.24
it's not jew it's grabbler

1677.12 --> 1684.08
and not all grapplers are jews

1680.24 --> 1686.24
so it's really that

1684.08 --> 1686.24
so

1687.44 --> 1691.679
you don't have to erase it all look i'm

1690.24 --> 1693.679
just saying it anyway i'm just

1691.679 --> 1697.8400000000001
i'm not saying it in any nefarious way

1693.679 --> 1697.8400000000001
it's just more like a historical fact

1698.159 --> 1703.0390000000002
it's no but look if if you really feel

1701.44 --> 1705.8400000000001
the need to say it like that

1703.039 --> 1710.08
yeah sure not really gonna stop you as

1705.84 --> 1713.36
long as you don't get crazy with it

1710.08 --> 1716.08
a non-funny way but

1713.36 --> 1718.24
overall yeah i don't really i prefer not

1716.08 --> 1718.24
to

1718.72 --> 1723.039
get too hostile like that because it's

1721.44 --> 1725.8400000000001
completely useless

1723.039 --> 1725.84
it's like

1726.72 --> 1730.32
it helps them in a way

1730.48 --> 1738.13
but not in in the way you understand it

1732.88 --> 1741.3490000000002
and that's why you do it

1738.13 --> 1741.3490000000002
[Music]

1747.44 --> 1752.159
so if you just stick to graveler just go

1749.919 --> 1755.1200000000001
for the the idea of the pharisee of

1752.159 --> 1757.44
somebody that's just willingly pushing

1755.12 --> 1757.4399999999998
sin

1757.76 --> 1762.32
trying to make other people like trying

1760.0 --> 1765.919
to make everything sinful to oppose

1762.32 --> 1767.279
creation and it's often on an intuitive

1765.919 --> 1770.0
level and that's

1767.279 --> 1770.0
a graveler

1771.919 --> 1778.48
and yeah somebody they just want things

1775.2 --> 1783.2
they just want their precious money

1778.48 --> 1785.84
and or just to get the sensation like

1783.2 --> 1787.3600000000001
they are in control like they are making

1785.84 --> 1790.6399999999999
everybody

1787.36 --> 1791.1999999999998
behave like yeah sinful beasts or

1790.64 --> 1794.7990000000002
whatever

1791.2 --> 1797.919
and then they feel all ratified about it

1794.799 --> 1799.36
because yeah god they made god into a

1797.919 --> 1800.64
failure like in their mind

1799.36 --> 1802.799
that sort of thing but that's all

1800.64 --> 1806.64
grappler that's not

1802.799 --> 1809.84
you because yeah an actual jew

1806.64 --> 1809.8400000000001
a good tauren

1809.919 --> 1814.7990000000002
that's yeah that's obviously not what

1812.799 --> 1817.44
they're supposed to be doing so it's

1814.799 --> 1818.799
already it's like a grappler it grabbled

1817.44 --> 1822.159
jew

1818.799 --> 1825.279
a jew can become a gravel a grabbler

1822.159 --> 1827.1200000000001
if they get grabbled their spirit gets

1825.279 --> 1828.799
grabble

1827.12 --> 1830.4799999999998
but that doesn't mean that all jews are

1828.799 --> 1834.559
grapplers see

1830.48 --> 1834.559
so i can say it like that that's okay i

1834.84 --> 1851.84
think

1837.039 --> 1851.84
what's with all the message retractions

1853.2 --> 1857.679
right but anyway because i was it was

1856.159 --> 1861.919
being brought up because

1857.679 --> 1863.76
yeah why does owen benjamin have so many

1861.919 --> 1865.279
negative things around him on the

1863.76 --> 1868.32
internet and wikipedia

1865.279 --> 1870.399
right well it's because he went hard

1868.32 --> 1872.6399999999999
on the jew just said like oh no i'm

1870.399 --> 1876.399
going to completely say

1872.64 --> 1877.6000000000001
no to even the superficial sensation of

1876.399 --> 1880.6399999999999
censorship of that

1877.6 --> 1882.6399999999999
and just really go hard at it as funny

1880.64 --> 1885.76
as possible

1882.64 --> 1889.8400000000001
and as ridiculing funny as possible

1885.76 --> 1889.84
and yeah that hit a lot of people

1891.519 --> 1895.519
in a way he threw like a a brick through

1894.559 --> 1898.6399999999999
a window

1895.519 --> 1902.32
metaphorically and

1898.64 --> 1905.519
but it was kind of necessary in a way

1902.32 --> 1907.9189999999999
it was i think it was supposed to happen

1905.519 --> 1909.1200000000001
but because of that yeah there's a lot

1907.919 --> 1913.279
of like who is it

1909.12 --> 1915.9189999999999
homophobia they totally went after him

1913.279 --> 1915.919
because of that

1918.84 --> 1924.8999999999999
probably

1921.84 --> 1924.8999999999999
[Music]

1927.44 --> 1931.3600000000001
it's been like that for a while by the

1929.12 --> 1935.4399999999998
way and home benjamin has

1931.36 --> 1937.6789999999999
just created baritaria in the meantime

1935.44 --> 1937.679
so

1939.919 --> 1948.88
and they have their own media platform

1944.399 --> 1952.1589999999999
so yeah that did happen but then he also

1948.88 --> 1954.72
he did get out of it he's just like

1952.159 --> 1955.279
yeah where he stepped away from there's

1954.72 --> 1957.3600000000001
a lot of

1955.279 --> 1959.12
squirting going on in his direction and

1957.36 --> 1961.279
they all hate him now because he did

1959.12 --> 1964.4799999999998
that and

1961.279 --> 1964.48
we can't get over it

1966.72 --> 1970.48
always thought satanic people run the

1968.799 --> 1977.84
world well that

1970.48 --> 1977.84
that depends on what that means to you

1979.6 --> 1983.12
i think people run the world

1986.96 --> 1991.039
like amendment yesterday he had that

1989.12 --> 1991.84
message again has had it for like a

1991.039 --> 1996.32
couple of days

1991.84 --> 1998.6399999999999
it's like the deep state is you

1996.32 --> 1999.4399999999998
like this enemy you're creating that's a

1998.64 --> 2003.2
side of you

1999.44 --> 2004.72
you're not able to deal with so you just

2003.2 --> 2008.0
create

2004.72 --> 2008.0
a virtual group

2008.32 --> 2013.36
that you think what must be some of that

2011.44 --> 2015.279
but you don't really know because you

2013.36 --> 2016.799
haven't actually checked out what those

2015.279 --> 2017.12
people are like what they're dealing

2016.799 --> 2020.559
with

2017.12 --> 2022.799
if they are indeed responsible

2020.559 --> 2023.6789999999999
because it's too much work too

2022.799 --> 2026.399
complicated

2023.679 --> 2028.159
and maybe scary because are you actually

2026.399 --> 2029.12
going to approach those people that

2028.159 --> 2031.279
could be very

2029.12 --> 2033.6
dangerous especially if you imagine it

2031.279 --> 2037.36
is very dangerous

2033.6 --> 2037.9189999999999
yeah so we end up creating a virtual

2037.36 --> 2041.12
enemy

2037.919 --> 2043.8400000000001
and guess what like

2041.12 --> 2043.84
governments

2044.159 --> 2049.44
kind of use that to create to basically

2048.48 --> 2052.56
try and mold

2049.44 --> 2054.399
or redraw attention away from

2052.56 --> 2056.159
other virtual enemies and then create a

2054.399 --> 2058.839
virtual enemy and then people latch on

2056.159 --> 2061.839
to that and that's part of their

2058.839 --> 2061.839
trickery

2062.32 --> 2068.7200000000003
and a lot of people do that and

2065.839 --> 2072.399
try their own thing even create their

2068.72 --> 2072.399
own specific virtual enemy

2072.639 --> 2077.04
and yeah the deep state is kind of like

2074.879 --> 2080.0789999999997
a project like that

2077.04 --> 2082.32
and i thought it was very effective how

2080.079 --> 2084.079
he explained it he got through to me

2082.32 --> 2087.76
again because i already knew it it's

2084.079 --> 2090.2400000000002
just to hear it again

2087.76 --> 2092.48
because even if you know it you know how

2090.24 --> 2095.6789999999996
things work

2092.48 --> 2097.92
you can still get caught in it in

2095.679 --> 2100.56
thinking that way anyway even though you

2097.92 --> 2100.56
kind of know

2101.599 --> 2106.0
it's part of a spell and then you by

2104.16 --> 2108.64
accident kind of forget

2106.0 --> 2110.48
it's freaky how that works i had that

2108.64 --> 2114.16
same effect with the globe

2110.48 --> 2115.76
and flat earth in yeah in my younger

2114.16 --> 2118.56
days

2115.76 --> 2119.119
like i like i figured out like wait it's

2118.56 --> 2120.88
fake

2119.119 --> 2122.7200000000003
right yeah because i had seen the proof

2120.88 --> 2125.44
of it and then you kind of by accident

2122.72 --> 2125.4399999999996
just forget

2125.599 --> 2131.839
and you get trapped in the spell again

2132.8 --> 2140.48
and yeah the deep state it is

2137.359 --> 2142.96
a virtual group because it's just it's

2140.48 --> 2142.96
all of them

2143.44 --> 2148.7200000000003
and they are like that also partially

2146.56 --> 2149.599
because of how the world is because of

2148.72 --> 2151.7599999999998
how the people

2149.599 --> 2151.76
are

2153.92 --> 2157.119
and yeah owen makes a great case for

2156.24 --> 2159.2
that

2157.119 --> 2161.119
i really appreciate it when he expands

2159.2 --> 2164.0789999999997
on that

2161.119 --> 2167.04
like our own tolerant yeah tolerance of

2164.079 --> 2170.5600000000004
bad behavior and

2167.04 --> 2172.88
seeming inabilities and just

2170.56 --> 2174.64
taking easily out how the preponderance

2172.88 --> 2179.52
of all that behavior basically

2174.64 --> 2179.52
creates the deep state we deserve

2179.76 --> 2187.8390000000004
and it makes a very good point at it i

2182.32 --> 2187.839
really appreciate that

2191.2 --> 2200.0
and it ties in with yeah like you create

2195.119 --> 2201.839
with your intention

2200.0 --> 2204.48
and that means you can create something

2201.839 --> 2206.88
that's better by envisioning it

2204.48 --> 2209.28
and then yeah projecting and acting

2206.88 --> 2212.4
towards that on the world

2209.28 --> 2214.8
but you can also envision an enemy

2212.4 --> 2216.1600000000003
and then kind of create that and then

2214.8 --> 2218.96
who knows

2216.16 --> 2220.64
what people are actually going to step

2218.96 --> 2224.32
into that virtual enemy

2220.64 --> 2225.52
and use it because i think that happens

2224.32 --> 2228.0
too

2225.52 --> 2229.7599999999998
like if some kind of dark legend is

2228.0 --> 2232.4
conjured up in people's minds

2229.76 --> 2233.3590000000004
then there might be people that are just

2232.4 --> 2236.88
have hot spa

2233.359 --> 2242.16
enough to actually say that's me

2236.88 --> 2245.28
and i'm doing that

2242.16 --> 2245.2799999999997
it's complicated

2245.44 --> 2257.839
because they want to take that legend

2249.119 --> 2257.839
and make it theirs that dark legend

2261.68 --> 2267.1189999999997
yes it really is a battle with ourselves

2264.48 --> 2271.04
it's a battle with

2267.119 --> 2274.6400000000003
the virtual enemy and how do you

2271.04 --> 2278.32
basically resolve

2274.64 --> 2280.0789999999997
it within yourself instead of just

2278.32 --> 2282.7200000000003
projecting the dark

2280.079 --> 2285.8390000000004
the darkness and the blame of everything

2282.72 --> 2285.839
onto that thing outside

2294.72 --> 2300.72
instead of kind of like realizing that

2298.64 --> 2302.24
pretty much everything that's happened

2300.72 --> 2305.839
to you

2302.24 --> 2309.5989999999997
is because of the choices you made

2305.839 --> 2313.44
and the reasons why don't really matter

2309.599 --> 2316.88
they matter to you to your virtual

2313.44 --> 2318.48
feeling world and it's of course a great

2316.88 --> 2319.119
important how you feel and what you can

2318.48 --> 2321.839
do

2319.119 --> 2322.88
with that but technically it's

2321.839 --> 2326.32
everything has happened

2322.88 --> 2328.56
it's your own fault and that's

2326.32 --> 2330.32
and some people may be then like really

2328.56 --> 2332.32
hurt because yeah sometimes something

2330.32 --> 2334.2400000000002
really terrible happens

2332.32 --> 2336.32
and it seems to come out of nowhere and

2334.24 --> 2340.56
it ruins everything

2336.32 --> 2343.52
but that's not exactly what i mean

2340.56 --> 2344.16
it's your response to it how do you take

2343.52 --> 2346.48
it

2344.16 --> 2348.72
that's your choice if you let sometimes

2346.48 --> 2349.599
you can let something traumatize you or

2348.72 --> 2351.9199999999996
you

2349.599 --> 2353.52
don't let it traumatize you you just get

2351.92 --> 2355.119
over it really quickly

2353.52 --> 2357.359
and it's a bit of a mystery how that

2355.119 --> 2359.92
works because with my life

2357.359 --> 2361.44
some things were just super impactful it

2359.92 --> 2363.839
hurt a lot

2361.44 --> 2366.7200000000003
and i had to like grieve over it and

2363.839 --> 2366.72
other things that

2366.88 --> 2370.48
were even much more weightful

2370.88 --> 2376.8
i didn't i didn't have to i just got

2374.48 --> 2378.72
over it really quickly like almost

2376.8 --> 2380.1600000000003
i had already grieved for it for a

2378.72 --> 2382.8799999999997
prolonged time

2380.16 --> 2384.7999999999997
over something i felt was coming and

2382.88 --> 2387.2000000000003
then it was different

2384.8 --> 2388.5600000000004
and it just moved on it was finally over

2387.2 --> 2392.7999999999997
it just

2388.56 --> 2392.7999999999997
yeah this is a very esoteric feeling

2394.64 --> 2399.5989999999997
but yeah everything the way you

2397.52 --> 2404.0
experience the world

2399.599 --> 2404.0
is because of the way you took it

2407.76 --> 2411.599
and if you think like that and you

2409.68 --> 2413.839
basically take responsibility for

2411.599 --> 2417.6800000000003
absolutely everything

2413.839 --> 2419.839
including your own feelings then

2417.68 --> 2421.2799999999997
it becomes a lot clearer that the idea

2419.839 --> 2424.72
of a deep state or it's

2421.28 --> 2428.2400000000002
them it's them that that is kind of like

2424.72 --> 2431.359
conjuring this virtual enemy

2428.24 --> 2434.0789999999997
and that may rub off

2431.359 --> 2435.2
on others too that get caught up in it

2434.079 --> 2439.52
because they're all just

2435.2 --> 2442.56
so eager to to take to get that

2439.52 --> 2445.839
enemy away to

2442.56 --> 2446.16
take them down to have all the troubles

2445.839 --> 2450.4
all

2446.16 --> 2452.72
burned along with the effigy effigy

2450.4 --> 2453.599
like a sacrifice like to get rid of all

2452.72 --> 2457.52
the trouble that's

2453.599 --> 2457.52
kind of where that leads to

2457.92 --> 2460.96
if everything is just left roaming out

2459.92 --> 2463.52
of control

2460.96 --> 2465.04
and there's no order to keep if the

2463.52 --> 2467.44
order is not kept

2465.04 --> 2469.119
then people will eventually that's

2467.44 --> 2471.2000000000003
behavior and this is also described in

2469.119 --> 2473.359
medieval situations it will just like a

2471.2 --> 2476.7999999999997
frenzy take people over and they will

2473.359 --> 2478.0
actually just go out and get somebody

2476.8 --> 2480.88
and then

2478.0 --> 2483.76
i don't know just kill them or burn them

2480.88 --> 2485.44
on a pile or something crazy

2483.76 --> 2488.1600000000003
and i think that way in the past when

2485.44 --> 2490.079
order was a lot less easy to keep that

2488.16 --> 2491.7599999999998
sort of [Â __Â ] did just happen because

2490.079 --> 2494.96
there wasn't

2491.76 --> 2497.92
there was nothing really to

2494.96 --> 2498.88
to contain that now we have all this

2497.92 --> 2500.96
stuff that is

2498.88 --> 2503.92
making us contain ourselves so that just

2500.96 --> 2503.92
doesn't really happen

2504.56 --> 2508.96
i'm glad it doesn't because it's a

2507.04 --> 2511.359
terrible thing it's a terrible side

2508.96 --> 2511.359
effect

2511.76 --> 2514.96
it doesn't really help

2515.119 --> 2519.599
but yeah we have the natural tendency to

2517.44 --> 2522.56
project an enemy

2519.599 --> 2524.48
and then we all agree who the enemy is

2522.56 --> 2527.52
and then we act

2524.48 --> 2530.64
with that direction in mind

2527.52 --> 2532.319
right like you oppose and that that can

2530.64 --> 2534.8799999999997
inspire in a way

2532.319 --> 2535.359
keep driving you to keep going even

2534.88 --> 2536.88
though it

2535.359 --> 2539.04
what you're doing might not even have

2536.88 --> 2539.52
anything to do in a direct sense with

2539.04 --> 2542.0
that

2539.52 --> 2545.359
but it's just like because you have to

2542.0 --> 2547.119
build up to oppose somebody

2545.359 --> 2549.2799999999997
then you put in a little bit more effort

2547.119 --> 2551.119
because you have something to do it for

2549.28 --> 2553.3590000000004
instead of just oh it's just another

2551.119 --> 2556.319
lazy day for nothing

2553.359 --> 2557.119
or whatever stupid job you don't really

2556.319 --> 2560.16
like

2557.119 --> 2564.319
with no outlook with nothing

2560.16 --> 2565.92
that you have to get better for so it's

2564.319 --> 2567.7599999999998
it's really comes down also to

2565.92 --> 2571.119
motivation and a lot of people do

2567.76 --> 2572.1600000000003
use just having a virtual enemy they use

2571.119 --> 2575.359
it

2572.16 --> 2578.3999999999996
to keep driving them to keep the energy

2575.359 --> 2582.64
up to inspire them to

2578.4 --> 2585.599
to make yeah to to make enormous efforts

2582.64 --> 2593.2799999999997
so they need a virtual enemy see see how

2585.599 --> 2597.76
complicated all of this really is

2593.28 --> 2602.0
so that need is being exploited

2597.76 --> 2605.44
by grabblers who will create virtual

2602.0 --> 2606.319
saviors and virtual enemies for us to

2605.44 --> 2609.68
latch onto

2606.319 --> 2612.24
and then and yeah statistically how

2609.68 --> 2612.96
the response is will also determine

2612.24 --> 2616.0789999999997
eventually

2612.96 --> 2618.88
where they will take it

2616.079 --> 2621.119
what the icons that catch our feelings

2618.88 --> 2623.04
will be

2621.119 --> 2626.079
and i think that trump has been

2623.04 --> 2629.119
absolutely used as a predominant

2626.079 --> 2633.04
icon for us to let your feelings on

2629.119 --> 2633.04
but in a very complicated way

2633.2 --> 2639.2799999999997
it's like a surreal thing that they made

2636.8 --> 2639.28
out of him

2641.119 --> 2649.839
from many angles right

2660.16 --> 2677.839
what is going on here

2681.92 --> 2686.079
dude sledgehammer what are you

2688.839 --> 2691.839
doing

2705.44 --> 2709.68
somebody's in a bit of a squirting mood

2707.28 --> 2709.6800000000003
today

2712.079 --> 2718.0
you need that virtual enemy strong you

2714.56 --> 2721.119
need to wake up

2718.0 --> 2724.88
think a lot of ballers just have

2721.119 --> 2724.88
that addiction like they are

2725.92 --> 2733.28
they need a virtual enemy to keep going

2728.96 --> 2735.52
and that's why they keep on coming back

2733.28 --> 2737.119
i think in a way it's just a tool to

2735.52 --> 2739.2
keep you woke up

2737.119 --> 2742.1600000000003
like they need to work wake up or they

2739.2 --> 2744.1099999999997
just fall asleep

2742.16 --> 2745.2
yeah roger i don't know what's wrong

2744.11 --> 2749.119
[Music]

2745.2 --> 2749.1189999999997
it's acting a bit weird in chat here

2759.839 --> 2764.7999999999997
or maybe he's just he's getting worked

2763.119 --> 2765.6800000000003
up because the flat earth debates are

2764.8 --> 2770.48
gonna

2765.68 --> 2770.48
start up in like eight minutes from now

2770.88 --> 2777.28
i think we're having a baller in a

2772.72 --> 2777.2799999999997
startup phase is getting ready to troll

2784.4 --> 2792.2400000000002
yeah i think that's what this is

2788.4 --> 2803.839
oh wait 66 minutes from now

2792.24 --> 2803.839
yeah you're right

2813.839 --> 2818.24
yeah i agree but just let him

2819.839 --> 2831.839
he entered the chat spiraling fashion

2822.64 --> 2831.839
let's see where that goes

2842.839 --> 2845.839
so

2850.319 --> 2855.44
but yeah the virtual enemy is actually a

2853.2 --> 2855.4399999999996
good

2855.92 --> 2861.989
good title i think

2858.8 --> 2861.989
[Music]

2864.8 --> 2873.8390000000004
let's see

2897.839 --> 2905.68
right then necessary virtual enemy

2901.2 --> 2905.68
you are the deep state you you create

2906.8 --> 2910.079
somebody that's to blame

2912.24 --> 2915.52
and then you pile on all your aggression

2914.8 --> 2917.6800000000003
onto that

2915.52 --> 2918.88
instead of realizing that all the things

2917.68 --> 2921.44
to blame

2918.88 --> 2922.559
are basically ending up with you falling

2921.44 --> 2925.839
for it

2922.559 --> 2925.8390000000004
and not getting over it

2926.0 --> 2930.079
or you just getting seduced and then

2929.28 --> 2932.88
knowingly

2930.079 --> 2932.88
falling for it

2934.16 --> 2937.359
and those two factors it's the seduction

2936.4 --> 2940.839
it's your

2937.359 --> 2945.119
your choices that have

2940.839 --> 2947.0
created yeah the hostility the anguish

2945.119 --> 2949.52
the

2947.0 --> 2950.559
dissatisfaction and then you project it

2949.52 --> 2957.839
onto the one

2950.559 --> 2957.8390000000004
that basically gave you the choice

2968.839 --> 2971.839
okay

2977.68 --> 2980.8799999999997
well there's nothing really stopping you

2979.92 --> 2985.839
from just

2980.88 --> 2985.839
asking honest questions at all

2996.4 --> 2999.44
what is international one day cricket i

2998.559 --> 3003.3590000000004
don't get it

2999.44 --> 3013.56
that's probably supposed to be funny

3003.359 --> 3018.8489999999997
i don't see it

[Music]

3025.96 --> 3030.35
[Music]

3037.52 --> 3042.319
what does that mean like i'm not playing

3052.839 --> 3057.839
cricket

3055.28 --> 3061.3590000000004
i think at least that being turfed out

3057.839 --> 3064.24
is a cricket terminology i take it

3061.359 --> 3065.2
right so i don't see how i'm being

3064.24 --> 3069.839
turfed out

3065.2 --> 3069.839
metaphorically either

3086.59 --> 3089.7690000000002
[Music]

3107.52 --> 3113.7599999999998
oh really well it all depends in

3110.72 --> 3117.1189999999997
how inappropriate and evasive and

3113.76 --> 3119.0400000000004
rude the inquiry is if you're just going

3117.119 --> 3122.2400000000002
to be a complete [Â __Â ]

3119.04 --> 3123.92
for no reason and want to know something

3122.24 --> 3125.68
that's none of your damn business is

3123.92 --> 3130.0
nobody's damn business

3125.68 --> 3133.44
with anybody out there then yeah

3130.0 --> 3137.599
if you're just asking a normal

3133.44 --> 3138.4
honest question or even like a baller

3137.599 --> 3141.44
question

3138.4 --> 3144.079
don't mind you know i'm used to that so

3141.44 --> 3145.76
it's just you're just being a whiny

3144.079 --> 3148.0
pants

3145.76 --> 3149.76
you're just playing a victim like oh no

3148.0 --> 3152.0
i can't do it i

3149.76 --> 3155.8390000000004
i can't actually have a point here

3152.0 --> 3155.839
because it'll be kicked oh really

3158.079 --> 3161.119
i've seen that tactic a lot more also by

3160.559 --> 3163.2000000000003
the way

3161.119 --> 3165.44
among ballers where they just go

3163.2 --> 3167.839
endlessly whining for 20 minutes

3165.44 --> 3170.88
straight about how

3167.839 --> 3174.0789999999997
how they're all being treated

3170.88 --> 3176.079
in justified and all that and while they

3174.079 --> 3179.6800000000003
are being asked a question that they

3176.079 --> 3182.96
they don't answer right

3179.68 --> 3185.52
that that victim tactic is really

3182.96 --> 3186.559
just lame it doesn't work it doesn't

3185.52 --> 3189.359
work on anybody

3186.559 --> 3189.76
except the person now that does it they

3189.359 --> 3192.48
may

3189.76 --> 3193.6800000000003
feel like they are justifying it or

3192.48 --> 3196.96
whatever

3193.68 --> 3200.0789999999997
but that tactic in general

3196.96 --> 3201.44
is not what it used to be like 10 years

3200.079 --> 3202.96
ago

3201.44 --> 3206.4
because there has been a lot of

3202.96 --> 3209.599
dispelling going on with that effect

3206.4 --> 3213.52
very widely it's been addressed

3209.599 --> 3216.6400000000003
figured out what it is victim tactics

3213.52 --> 3217.68
and it doesn't work as well as it used

3216.64 --> 3220.0789999999997
to

3217.68 --> 3222.0789999999997
people see through that [Â __Â ] right away

3220.079 --> 3225.6800000000003
see oh you're just trying to distract

3222.079 --> 3229.119
away from whatever from having a point

3225.68 --> 3231.52
from giving an answer to a question

3229.119 --> 3233.44
and you're just yeah whining about it

3231.52 --> 3234.48
about how you're a poor little boy or

3233.44 --> 3236.559
whatever

3234.48 --> 3239.04
well nobody really cares it's just

3236.559 --> 3239.0400000000004
annoying

3243.92 --> 3248.559
oh right roger well there you go it's

3246.319 --> 3251.599
really a thing and i haven't even

3248.559 --> 3252.559
gone to 24 7 flat earth discord or

3251.599 --> 3254.2400000000002
anything

3252.559 --> 3256.8
for a while i've been kind of on my own

3254.24 --> 3258.4799999999996
but every time i get somewhere i do pick

3256.8 --> 3260.0
up on these things and it has been

3258.48 --> 3265.839
happening more and more and more they're

3260.0 --> 3265.839
just whining and being complaining

3279.46 --> 3282.639
[Music]

3298.799 --> 3305.119
ah and you're not a dumbass baller okay

3302.799 --> 3305.119
sure

3305.92 --> 3309.599
in that case you just are in a bad mood

3308.559 --> 3314.4
i guess

3309.599 --> 3314.4
or you're really triggered or

3315.04 --> 3322.079
you have polarized yourself in a certain

3318.839 --> 3324.16
group against me

3322.079 --> 3325.76
or people that i deal with for some

3324.16 --> 3329.44
reason then i guess

3325.76 --> 3331.44
what you an ether believer

3329.44 --> 3335.839
or you think there's a downward bias

3331.44 --> 3335.839
because that's a whole new category now

3340.16 --> 3349.839
so why is it triggered what's going on

3351.28 --> 3354.3990000000003

3388.839 --> 3405.839

mike who mike who

3411.44 --> 3423.119
mike fox oh dear

3419.52 --> 3425.599
but wasn't he a baller are you sure

3423.119 --> 3425.599
territ

3430.48 --> 3434.16
yeah it seems like here we go again

3433.04 --> 3437.2799999999997
maybe he's just here

3434.16 --> 3439.2
just to break the flow we'll see i'll

3437.28 --> 3440.4
just gonna move on and if he's gonna do

3439.2 --> 3442.16
it again then i'm

3440.4 --> 3444.7200000000003
just immediately gonna ban him because

3442.16 --> 3448.24
then he is just here to break my flow

3444.72 --> 3452.3999999999996
maybe he is it's just being

3448.24 --> 3452.3999999999996
possessed i don't know

3454.16 --> 3459.5989999999997
he already considered defeat okay if you

3457.119 --> 3459.599
say so

3459.68 --> 3464.48
uh right but

3462.799 --> 3467.52
yeah now the flow is kind of broken

3464.48 --> 3474.96
anyway but i also kind of

3467.52 --> 3477.359
i think i said pretty much everything

3474.96 --> 3478.079
because you guys do understand right the

3477.359 --> 3481.92
concept

3478.079 --> 3485.52
and yeah the necessary virtual enemy

3481.92 --> 3489.76
and why like

3485.52 --> 3492.48
it can be used to inspire you

3489.76 --> 3502.9900000000002
but you can also use it as an excuse to

3492.48 --> 3506.05
basically give up

3502.99 --> 3506.0499999999997
[Music]

3506.72 --> 3509.9199999999996
oh wow really

3514.0 --> 3517.44
ah so that means he's in the grief phase

3516.88 --> 3522.7200000000003
okay

3517.44 --> 3522.7200000000003
well take it easy on him then dude

3527.28 --> 3532.799
gotta realize what that means if he's

3529.359 --> 3535.7599999999998
really conceited defeat

3532.799 --> 3536.319
then that's pretty dramatic and you

3535.76 --> 3539.3590000000004
should be

3536.319 --> 3539.359
take it easy on him

3543.359 --> 3550.4
because ballers rarely concede

3547.92 --> 3552.2400000000002
it's very tough for people that have

3550.4 --> 3554.48
been very tenacious onto the ball to

3552.24 --> 3558.8799999999997
step away from that that's

3554.48 --> 3573.839
that's pretty incredible

3558.88 --> 3573.839
to at least be able to concede

3586.4 --> 3590.319
i get it tara it's just that

3591.04 --> 3595.7599999999998
you gotta realize that if they step away

3593.359 --> 3598.96
that means they could be

3595.76 --> 3600.6400000000003
potentially your friends in in a year or

3598.96 --> 3604.4
half a year

3600.64 --> 3607.5989999999997
because people do change around a lot

3604.4 --> 3609.359
when they actually get through that

3607.599 --> 3610.96
through that nexus point actually get

3609.359 --> 3615.839
over the globe

3610.96 --> 3615.839
they change a lot so take it easy on

3634.24 --> 3640.16
right it's it's when they're stubborn

3637.839 --> 3641.7599999999998
yeah then i totally get it you just want

3640.16 --> 3645.2
to go at it right

3641.76 --> 3646.4
and because they just keep on imagining

3645.2 --> 3649.52
how they've won

3646.4 --> 3651.359
as ballers anyway despite everything

3649.52 --> 3652.559
yeah i get it you want to definitely go

3651.359 --> 3655.359
at that

3652.559 --> 3656.6400000000003
but when they're actually giving that up

3655.359 --> 3658.319
you know

3656.64 --> 3660.4
they're letting down their guard that

3658.319 --> 3662.88
means they are much more vulnerable

3660.4 --> 3664.2400000000002
you shouldn't then like high level

3662.88 --> 3668.6400000000003
attack them

3664.24 --> 3668.64
that's really rude that's really painful

3669.28 --> 3673.0400000000004
and it's not good for you either

3671.28 --> 3674.7200000000003
karmically

3673.04 --> 3677.2
because you're actually now hurting

3674.72 --> 3680.72
somebody when you do that

3677.2 --> 3681.2
spiritually because if they have their

3680.72 --> 3684.0789999999997
like

3681.2 --> 3684.64
infinite flexible baller defense shield

3684.079 --> 3687.6800000000003
on

3684.64 --> 3690.4
yeah you can strike as hard as you like

3687.68 --> 3691.04
they will just like judo it away and all

3690.4 --> 3693.119
that

3691.04 --> 3695.04
but if they stop doing that and you give

3693.119 --> 3696.2400000000002
that brutal level attack yeah you're

3695.04 --> 3697.44
really going to wound them you don't

3696.24 --> 3699.68
want to do that

3697.44 --> 3701.68
because it was all about getting through

3699.68 --> 3706.0789999999997
to them anyway

3701.68 --> 3706.0789999999997
right don't lose track of that

3708.799 --> 3715.68
a minor god and amanda young

3712.96 --> 3715.68

3736.319 --> 3741.839
oh jesus

3742.96 --> 3755.839
where did you hear that

3765.599 --> 3770.2400000000002
i'm not seeing anything reflect at it if

3768.48 --> 3772.96
that would really be happening it would

3770.24 --> 3775.0389999999998
be all over the news that would

3772.96 --> 3783.44
so i don't know where we're getting that

3775.039 --> 3787.599
here we go again

3783.44 --> 3797.839
okay well send to me over skype

3787.599 --> 3799.76
i'll check it out

3797.839 --> 3802.24
but yeah if you're getting it through

3799.76 --> 3802.2400000000002
england

3802.4 --> 3804.96
i don't know

3806.16 --> 3811.359
let's see it on the wider platform like

3809.2 --> 3813.4399999999996
yeah because if that's real it's going

3811.359 --> 3815.92
to spread everywhere

3813.44 --> 3818.2400000000002
very quickly because it is pretty heavy

3815.92 --> 3818.2400000000002
stuff

3818.48 --> 3822.2400000000002
so i'm almost inclined to say that it's

3820.799 --> 3825.0389999999998
probably misinformation

3822.24 --> 3827.2
otherwise it would be everywhere now

3825.039 --> 3839.8390000000004
that sort of thing spreads like wildfire

3827.2 --> 3839.839
over media

3845.599 --> 3849.92
the democrats going for impeachment oh

3850.839 --> 3853.839
sure

3881.839 --> 3895.839
ah wait let me check

3903.039 --> 3905.3590000000004
nope

3906.319 --> 3909.839
i'm not seeing it

3911.839 --> 3923.839
oh pelosi pence

3925.28 --> 3930.3190000000004
threaten oh yeah oh so it's threatened

3927.92 --> 3937.839
oh wow

3930.319 --> 3937.839
what do you [Â __Â ] do

3948.96 --> 3955.52
man pence is such a freaking sellout

3952.319 --> 3955.52
it's just unbelievable

3956.079 --> 3959.44
but yeah that's

3960.16 --> 3965.839
i don't know

3968.799 --> 3976.16
oh that's fine look rt is

3972.72 --> 3978.5589999999997
relatively okay i have some weird issues

3976.16 --> 3983.0389999999998
here and there but

3978.559 --> 3983.039
i used to follow rt for a long time

3984.64 --> 3990.799
but this is just basically just them

3987.76 --> 3990.7990000000004
blabbering on it

3991.76 --> 3996.48
i don't see what was it what did you say

4004.839 --> 4009.44
again

4006.559 --> 4009.44
that uh

4010.0 --> 4015.92
yeah an insurrection act trump has

4013.119 --> 4019.6800000000003
invoked an insurrection act where

4015.92 --> 4022.4
i don't see it here maybe i'm just not

4019.68 --> 4022.3999999999996
reading right

4024.64 --> 4027.92
let me just

4026.5 --> 4030.16
[Music]

4027.92 --> 4030.16
nope

4031.68 --> 4036.319
mr trump from from invoking

4038.319 --> 4041.0389999999998
no wait that's

4042.96 --> 4048.2400000000002
yeah it's not in the article people are

4044.96 --> 4051.119
talking about in the comments that he

4048.24 --> 4051.1189999999997
hasn't done it

4051.28 --> 4055.44
so the entire premise is kind of yeah

4053.76 --> 4057.6800000000003
for inserting that

4055.44 --> 4063.76
like no no he hasn't done that it

4057.68 --> 4066.24
doesn't say he has done that

4063.76 --> 4068.0
and the democrats are always freaking

4066.24 --> 4071.4399999999996
threatening him so it's just

4068.0 --> 4071.44
it's just a bunch of blabbering

4072.0 --> 4077.839
it's okay

4078.16 --> 4081.7599999999998
don't worry about it that sort of thing

4080.48 --> 4084.2400000000002
happens all the time

4081.76 --> 4086.96
even i myself make the mistake sometimes

4084.24 --> 4091.0389999999998
it's just like oh god the headline

4086.96 --> 4093.76
and then not actually checking

4091.039 --> 4094.079
what it's about and then still taking it

4093.76 --> 4096.319
as

4094.079 --> 4097.759
an acceptable source what i thought

4096.319 --> 4105.359
about it that's just

4097.759 --> 4110.48
it it happens sometimes

4105.359 --> 4110.4800000000005
gda what does that mean mind warped

4116.159 --> 4120.5599999999995
he's threatened if states don't change

4119.04 --> 4126.0
okay

4120.56 --> 4126.0
a good day yeah oh you're going again

4131.44 --> 4147.839
oh wait no you just arrived yeah hello

4135.04 --> 4147.839
hold on i'll be back in two minutes

4158.839 --> 4161.839
so

4228.84 --> 4233.4400000000005
you

4230.4 --> 4233.44
okay mind warp

4234.48 --> 4238.639999999999
not much of a book reader but yeah if

4237.04 --> 4242.719
you just give me the pdf

4238.64 --> 4244.96
i'll take it i have a whole pile of pdfs

4242.719 --> 4246.96
i guess that if the internet would go

4244.96 --> 4249.12
down for half a year i'd probably have

4246.96 --> 4252.08
enough reading material to spend all my

4249.12 --> 4252.08
time just reading

4252.56 --> 4259.84
if i would ever get to that

4256.4 --> 4259.839999999999
not doing other things

4260.88 --> 4263.52
so fine

4270.84 --> 4273.84
okay

4284.84 --> 4287.84
hmm

4290.96 --> 4294.4800000000005
okay that sounds kind of

4294.96 --> 4301.84
new ageish but hey if you like it you

4298.32 --> 4301.84
like it i'll take a look at it

4303.52 --> 4305.92
okay

4309.76 --> 4318.400000000001
i can't really download it by the way

4314.8 --> 4322.0
like that so if you have the pdf on your

4318.4 --> 4325.199
computer it would be nice if you just

4322.0 --> 4329.84
threw it in the skype feed the pdf

4325.199 --> 4329.839999999999
itself and not the link to it

4341.12 --> 4343.84
cool

4344.4 --> 4348.159
why is the sun she's still in prison

4348.96 --> 4357.84
i don't know

4359.22 --> 4362.339
[Music]

4364.32 --> 4367.44
i think maybe sometimes he is in prison

4367.04 --> 4369.92
and

4367.44 --> 4373.44
remains there because like he really

4369.92 --> 4375.4400000000005
wanted to go after the deep state

4373.44 --> 4379.12
like for real and that's why they're

4375.44 --> 4379.12
keeping them there at all costs

4379.84 --> 4384.96
like despite the the negative side of

4383.12 --> 4387.92
public attention side effect that come

4384.96 --> 4399.84
from it maybe that's why

4387.92 --> 4399.84
but i i'm not sure

4410.84 --> 4413.84
hmm

4422.4 --> 4427.839999999999
how are they doing well just exercise of

4424.56 --> 4427.84
raw power

4429.6 --> 4432.64
it's just how they're doing it well

4431.52 --> 4441.84
they're just doing it

4432.64 --> 4441.84
so what are you gonna do to stop it

4443.51 --> 4447.299
[Music]

4448.239 --> 4455.839999999999
but yeah who knows how long this is

4450.08 --> 4455.84
gonna last

4468.8 --> 4472.56
[Music]

4481.6 --> 4486.8
is there a show after mine yeah of

4483.44 --> 4486.799999999999

4504.83 --> 4508.0199999999995
[Music]

4508.84 --> 4511.84
so

4543.199 --> 4553.839999999999
hmm you would watch if you got if i got

4570.64 --> 4573.280000000001
same name

4574.239 --> 4581.839999999999
all right i'll check it out

4584.8 --> 4595.84
see if i can find it

4609.76 --> 4612.939
[Music]

4620.84 --> 4623.84
okay

4624.4 --> 4627.28
i don't see it

4635.44 --> 4639.28
it's not there i don't think you were

4638.08 --> 4651.84
blocked

4639.28 --> 4651.84
why are you getting this

4697.57 --> 4703.84
[Music]

4699.679 --> 4707.04
right well look whatever

4703.84 --> 4710.0
other account you have i looked

4707.04 --> 4711.44
exactly on the name of what you have

4710.0 --> 4714.64
right now

4711.44 --> 4716.4
and it wasn't in there so i don't know

4714.64 --> 4720.719
what your other name is but it's not

4716.4 --> 4723.839999999999
this one

4720.719 --> 4725.679
and i'm only going to search with like

4723.84 --> 4727.1990000000005
the search function because i have so

4725.679 --> 4730.56
many blocked people

4727.199 --> 4735.839999999999
this is it's just i'm not going to

4730.56 --> 4735.84
manually look through that

4742.719 --> 4749.679
yeah zack i know a good servant

4746.88 --> 4751.52
is nice but he's like in a way

4749.679 --> 4754.88
forcefully nice

4751.52 --> 4755.76
and he is kind of zealous he's like a

4754.88 --> 4759.04
really

4755.76 --> 4759.04
zealous type christian

4759.36 --> 4763.839999999999
and he has issues

4772.08 --> 4777.199
but yeah i don't know some of the people

4775.04 --> 4779.36
here in chat think that he's all bad and

4777.199 --> 4782.48
everything

4779.36 --> 4784.96
he's not he's just making mistakes

4782.48 --> 4786.879999999999
and i knew that and it got really pissed

4784.96 --> 4788.64
off at the time because i had so

4786.88 --> 4791.04
too much energy and i really felt like

4788.64 --> 4794.56
he's a betrayer

4791.04 --> 4797.5199999999995
and he is he was to

4794.56 --> 4797.52
what we were doing

4801.04 --> 4808.0
because i was trying to get like really

4804.96 --> 4811.92
up close to see

4808.0 --> 4813.36
yet to see if i could kind of help him

4811.92 --> 4816.8
ascend in ways

4813.36 --> 4819.839999999999
make him figure things out but

4816.8 --> 4821.679
he's not evil and he just went with this

4819.84 --> 4823.92
tony starna guy

4821.679 --> 4825.1990000000005
and now he's had a falling out with him

4823.92 --> 4829.28
and he actually

4825.199 --> 4829.28
stuck up for me and

4829.92 --> 4835.1990000000005
he is trying to move on to another he

4832.88 --> 4837.52
just wants to have a show

4835.199 --> 4840.0
that's it but i'm not gonna be part of

4837.52 --> 4840.0
that show

4842.719 --> 4847.84
but i'm not gonna see him as an enemy

4845.44 --> 4847.839999999999
either

4849.04 --> 4853.44
he's just in certain ways unreliable and

4852.32 --> 4856.719
there's nothing he

4853.44 --> 4858.719
can really do to change that unless he

4856.719 --> 4862.2390000000005
radically changes which i don't really

4858.719 --> 4862.2390000000005
see happening anytime soon

4863.04 --> 4866.639
but i'm not going to see him as an enemy

4864.719 --> 4868.32
i'm just seeing as like a guy that

4866.639 --> 4872.08
really wants to do on youtube

4868.32 --> 4875.36
wants to have a show wants to

4872.08 --> 4879.28
has is a good person deep inside

4875.36 --> 4881.199
and has issues and is very zealous about

4879.28 --> 4884.639
certain things

4881.199 --> 4884.638999999999
and naive in other things

4885.84 --> 4890.719
ah yeah mind of god well that's your

4888.32 --> 4890.719
problem

4890.8 --> 4894.8
if you want to make him your virtual

4893.12 --> 4896.639
enemy if you need that

4894.8 --> 4903.84
then you do that but i'm not going to be

4896.639 --> 4903.84
part of that

4909.44 --> 4914.719
and if you're going to behave very

4911.199 --> 4914.719
shamefully towards him

4914.88 --> 4918.8
yeah it's the title of the show mind of

4917.12 --> 4921.5199999999995
god

4918.8 --> 4922.8
if you're gonna act shamefully and i

4921.52 --> 4925.679
take note of that

4922.8 --> 4927.1990000000005
towards him because he's your enemy yeah

4925.679 --> 4929.4400000000005
just because you think somebody's your

4927.199 --> 4931.5199999999995
enemy is not a good excuse to just let

4929.44 --> 4933.678999999999
it go and start act demonically

4931.52 --> 4935.84
and if i take note of that then i will

4933.679 --> 4936.4800000000005
hold you accountable towards that even

4935.84 --> 4940.08
if you don't

4936.48 --> 4940.08
directly do it in this show

4941.199 --> 4948.239
so just so you know having enemies

4945.12 --> 4952.159
you know having opponents is one thing

4948.239 --> 4959.839999999999
if there is something to really do

4952.159 --> 4959.839999999999
but just declaring an enemy on somebody

4963.6 --> 4971.04
trying to be nicer in 2021 well

4967.76 --> 4971.84
then maybe just recognize that a lot of

4971.04 --> 4975.12
this

4971.84 --> 4977.28
need for a virtual enemy is because of

4975.12 --> 4977.76
your own frustrations maybe it's better

4977.28 --> 4980.48
to

4977.76 --> 4982.159000000001
see if you can try and deal with that on

4980.48 --> 4984.799999999999
your own

4982.159 --> 4986.239
with yourself and that's very tough by

4984.8 --> 4988.56
the way i'm not saying oh

4986.239 --> 4990.4
just just do it you know i know i know

4988.56 --> 4993.679
it [Â __Â ] hard

4990.4 --> 4996.0
but it's necessary it's necessary

4993.679 --> 4997.4400000000005
because there's groups there's other

4996.0 --> 5001.28
people there's

4997.44 --> 5004.638999999999
system users that are abusing

5001.28 --> 5005.36
the general need that is being conjured

5004.639 --> 5008.08
by people

5005.36 --> 5010.4
of an opponent they're using all that

5008.08 --> 5012.4
and they're feeding off it

5010.4 --> 5014.799999999999
and they're reinforcing it so it's

5012.4 --> 5016.96
better to in general not be a part of it

5014.8 --> 5018.56
but it's very tough to step away from it

5016.96 --> 5020.4800000000005
if you have it as a habit it's very

5018.56 --> 5023.280000000001
tough i know i used to be there

5020.48 --> 5025.759999999999
it's very tenacious and made me like

5023.28 --> 5029.199
really anti-social

5025.76 --> 5030.0
it's just not good now thankfully i

5029.199 --> 5033.44
haven't been

5030.0 --> 5037.199
as bad as that like on the show

5033.44 --> 5040.879999999999
been very frustrated

5037.199 --> 5043.12
hurt and angry on this show but i was

5040.88 --> 5045.4400000000005
never like that

5043.12 --> 5047.679
because it's like an attitude now i had

5045.44 --> 5051.599999999999
those issues in my teen times and

5047.679 --> 5051.6
unfortunately slightly beyond that

5052.0 --> 5057.84
but that's like a lot worse just

5058.4 --> 5061.44
declaring enemies you just got to be

5060.639 --> 5064.2390000000005
careful

5061.44 --> 5066.159
because most of the times the enemy is

5064.239 --> 5069.44
actually yourself and you're not

5066.159 --> 5071.5199999999995
and your unwillingness or inability

5069.44 --> 5073.28
virtual inability to deal with it and

5071.52 --> 5076.400000000001
then you project it onto others

5073.28 --> 5076.96
and yeah we see a lot of people doing

5076.4 --> 5080.96
this

5076.96 --> 5082.96
all the time especially

5080.96 --> 5084.159
around the flat earth scene with the

5082.96 --> 5087.36
ballers

5084.159 --> 5090.48
could safely say like that's some

5087.36 --> 5093.44
ballers that seems to be

5090.48 --> 5095.04
probably 80 percent of their social time

5093.44 --> 5097.36
that's how they spend their time

5095.04 --> 5100.8
socially

5097.36 --> 5102.96
attacking attacking attacking

5100.8 --> 5104.56
dominating dominating dominating with

5102.96 --> 5107.28
their belief

5104.56 --> 5107.280000000001
and it's not

5107.76 --> 5113.84
is not very productive

5121.679 --> 5124.84
bald earth is necessary for mental

5123.6 --> 5128.4800000000005
enslavement

5124.84 --> 5131.76
oh it's just a reliable

5128.48 --> 5135.839999999999
system a high

5131.76 --> 5138.320000000001
threshold spell that is just

5135.84 --> 5139.52
impossible to overcome for some so they

5138.32 --> 5142.719
will defend it

5139.52 --> 5143.76
almost to the death and it was designed

5142.719 --> 5147.44
to do that

5143.76 --> 5149.12
as a as a cage cage you could climb out

5147.44 --> 5151.12
of but it's just too tough for people

5149.12 --> 5152.719
they've just become too used to being in

5151.12 --> 5154.88
the cage

5152.719 --> 5158.08
so it's even though you could climb out

5154.88 --> 5160.639
of it it's not closed up

5158.08 --> 5169.84
they just want because it's they're too

5160.639 --> 5169.84
used to it it's their home now

5176.96 --> 5182.96
i would say yeah but tiny womble you are

5180.239 --> 5185.919999999999
an ex you are the exception though at

5182.96 --> 5188.88
least behavioral wise

5185.92 --> 5190.56
from what i can see and in here i don't

5188.88 --> 5193.76
know you might be

5190.56 --> 5193.76
i don't know what you do

5193.92 --> 5198.2390000000005
outside i don't know you that well

5201.6 --> 5204.96
but yes in here

5209.52 --> 5214.400000000001
but even when you compartmentalize and

5211.76 --> 5216.56
you do still attack

5214.4 --> 5218.799999999999
often you over you underestimate how

5216.56 --> 5223.120000000001
much time that actually takes up

5218.8 --> 5225.84
in reality because you fly through it

5223.12 --> 5238.88
because you're releasing in ways when

5225.84 --> 5243.1990000000005
you do it

5238.88 --> 5246.4800000000005
what didn't know he was bad to irwin

5243.199 --> 5248.4
just what no i know that zack

5246.48 --> 5249.599999999999
but there's just we are talking about

5248.4 --> 5252.719
good servant right

5249.6 --> 5254.639
it's just don't worry about it oh yeah

5252.719 --> 5255.6
by the way hello julio pepin good to see

5254.639 --> 5258.4800000000005
you

5255.6 --> 5258.4800000000005
i almost missed you

5260.639 --> 5266.639
now a good servant is an issue

5263.679 --> 5269.12
before you came on the show look zach

5266.639 --> 5271.04
you joined the show in like a month

5269.12 --> 5274.32
this show is like consistently been

5271.04 --> 5278.32
going for two years

5274.32 --> 5280.48
see so it has

5278.32 --> 5282.239
quite a lot has happened a lot of people

5280.48 --> 5285.678999999999
have come and gone

5282.239 --> 5288.4
in chat and sometimes even on the show

5285.679 --> 5292.08
so yeah there's just a history we're not

5288.4 --> 5292.08
expecting you to know it

5292.84 --> 5295.84
okay

5296.4 --> 5311.839999999999
don't worry about it

5308.56 --> 5316.400000000001
and a good servant he is like he

5311.84 --> 5316.400000000001
is trying to be good a lot

5318.88 --> 5323.84
but in ways he also seems just kind of

5321.04 --> 5323.84
naive to me

5324.639 --> 5327.92
in ways that i am not

5328.719 --> 5332.2390000000005
not saying i'm not naive in any kind of

5330.639 --> 5334.88
way

5332.239 --> 5338.239
because i am the certain parts of me

5334.88 --> 5351.84
have a tendency for naivety

5338.239 --> 5351.839999999999
it's just not the same parts

5364.32 --> 5379.84
oh damn yeah you did say that did you

5369.12 --> 5379.84
that's crazy

5384.08 --> 5388.0
like at least if you're gonna just put

5385.84 --> 5390.56
it out there just like that

5388.0 --> 5392.239
because yeah you could philosophically

5390.56 --> 5394.56
argue in ways

5392.239 --> 5397.599999999999
to achieve like like yeah there's kind

5394.56 --> 5399.76
of a mirror situation going on

5397.6 --> 5401.1990000000005
but to just overtly state it like that

5399.76 --> 5407.84
yeah that's quite nutty there

5401.199 --> 5407.839999999999
minor god

5432.84 --> 5435.84
what

5456.48 --> 5463.839999999999
i'm getting a little confused here this

5458.639 --> 5463.84
is getting very mixed up

5476.96 --> 5482.08
he made up stuff you didn't say are you

5479.12 --> 5482.08
sure the mind got

5484.32 --> 5488.719
but you did say some pretty nutty things

5486.639 --> 5489.12
you put down things in a way that are

5488.719 --> 5493.28
not

5489.12 --> 5493.28
on the level in the sense

5493.52 --> 5498.320000000001
i probably understood where you were

5495.28 --> 5500.159
going you just didn't

5498.32 --> 5501.44
so and you were saying things that you

5500.159 --> 5505.839999999999
were not

5501.44 --> 5505.839999999999
it just it wasn't put right

5506.96 --> 5511.6
other account is still not visible in

5509.36 --> 5511.599999999999
well

5512.08 --> 5515.76
either your other account is not called

5514.639 --> 5520.0
the

5515.76 --> 5521.6
space mind space of space god

5520.0 --> 5523.84
and then i couldn't find it in the

5521.6 --> 5526.8
banned list

5523.84 --> 5533.84
or i don't know you got another issue i

5526.8 --> 5533.84
don't know what's going on

5544.84 --> 5547.84
um

5555.92 --> 5561.84
yeah it's a different list it's you have

5557.76 --> 5561.84
google blocked and you have chat blocked

5563.679 --> 5567.52
did i block you on google could be

5565.84 --> 5570.56
actually i didn't check that yet

5567.52 --> 5575.84
i'll check it but i thought i almost

5570.56 --> 5575.84
unblocked everyone

5579.36 --> 5586.839999999999
yeah i don't have anybody blocked

5583.36 --> 5589.839999999999
so this is just you or you got the name

5586.84 --> 5589.84
wrong

5592.4 --> 5595.599999999999
[Music]

5600.0 --> 5617.679
really terrible 306

5603.76 --> 5619.6
the north pole done by india okay

5617.679 --> 5621.52
because there have been videos where

5619.6 --> 5623.360000000001
supposedly something went

5621.52 --> 5630.0
over the north pole but they actually

5623.36 --> 5633.28
just kind of went past it

5630.0 --> 5637.12
they obviously during during the journey

5633.28 --> 5637.12
at some point change the angle

5639.84 --> 5645.84
or is this a really recent video tear

5642.8 --> 5645.84
terror 306

5647.04 --> 5650.8
the video showed an interview oh so they

5649.92 --> 5659.84
said

5650.8 --> 5659.84
they did it that's cute

5664.89 --> 5667.939
[Music]

5694.08 --> 5698.8
all right oh look you got a wrench you

5698.239 --> 5701.04
can

5698.8 --> 5715.84
you can just put the link in the chat

5701.04 --> 5715.84
i'll check it out

5756.38 --> 5760.400000000001
[Music]

5758.159 --> 5761.5199999999995
yeah tear it are you on skype by the way

5760.4 --> 5763.679
because

5761.52 --> 5771.84
otherwise if you just send it over there

5763.679 --> 5771.84
that would be even easier

5814.8 --> 5819.4400000000005
thank you ndtv

5824.84 --> 5827.84
okay

5852.84 --> 5855.84
what

5873.36 --> 5879.839999999999
okay that's that

5876.719 --> 5881.52
they were it's just

5879.84 --> 5883.52
saying they were doing it that's it

5881.52 --> 5885.280000000001
there's no actual footage

5883.52 --> 5888.56
anywhere it's just saying oh yeah we

5885.28 --> 5888.5599999999995
just did that that's it

5890.719 --> 5894.8
but yeah thanks for trying anyway tara

5894.84 --> 5897.84
306.

5898.96 --> 5911.84
yo anyone can say they did it

5902.88 --> 5911.84
why don't you prove it

5912.06 --> 5915.209000000001
[Music]

5918.14 --> 5921.339
[Music]

5922.84 --> 5925.84
so

5936.84 --> 5939.84
hmm

5948.32 --> 5956.96
yeah and banana eye

5953.199 --> 5956.96
don't know who you are exactly but

5959.199 --> 5966.0
there's no curvature the horizon

5963.44 --> 5967.599999999999
is not the edge of a sphere you're

5966.0 --> 5970.719
looking at

5967.6 --> 5972.400000000001
black swan observations disprove that

5970.719 --> 5974.96
notion

5972.4 --> 5976.0
because if the earth was a sphere of

5974.96 --> 5979.679
geometrical

5976.0 --> 5982.4
physical sphere then

5979.679 --> 5983.119
yeah that physical nature would

5982.4 --> 5987.599999999999
physically

5983.119 --> 5989.36
obstruct our view in a very consistent

5987.6 --> 5993.4400000000005
way that cannot be

5989.36 --> 5997.119
altered by natural refraction effects

5993.44 --> 5997.119
due to like weather conditions

5999.119 --> 6006.239
but we can see extremely far and no

6002.96 --> 6010.4
weather conditions could justify that

6006.239 --> 6010.4
on a geometrical literal globe

6011.28 --> 6014.48
so the earth is not a geometrical

6012.96 --> 6017.36
literal globe

6014.48 --> 6017.839999999999
and yeah concerning those extreme far

6017.36 --> 6021.839999999999
sights

6017.84 --> 6025.84
one can only conclude that the earth is

6021.84 --> 6030.0
flat or almost perfectly flat

6025.84 --> 6031.88
flat enough as i like to call it

6030.0 --> 6033.119
because there's definitely not a

6031.88 --> 6037.04
geometrical

6033.119 --> 6039.28
obstruction that can be detected in any

6037.04 --> 6039.28
way

6044.239 --> 6047.599999999999
so banana you can stop addressing minor

6046.48 --> 6051.5199999999995
god now because i

6047.6 --> 6053.84
am addressing you i am the show host

6051.52 --> 6054.56
and you are in my chat and my chat is

6053.84 --> 6057.4400000000005
not some

6054.56 --> 6065.84
side chat you can blabber on with no i

6057.44 --> 6065.839999999999
actually interact with my side chat

6066.8 --> 6071.52
okay somebody seems to be going a full

6068.639 --> 6071.52
sport mode now

6076.84 --> 6084.639
wow he's having a lot of fun

6080.48 --> 6087.919999999999
sharing his pain and handwave dismissing

6084.639 --> 6090.08
well laid out arguments that he cannot

6087.92 --> 6093.04
really address

6090.08 --> 6093.5199999999995
no i'm not blocking him and yes he is a

6093.04 --> 6095.92
troll

6093.52 --> 6097.4400000000005
but he's just he's just hurting so let

6095.92 --> 6100.56
him just share his pain

6097.44 --> 6104.839999999999
just let it go past you he's made

6100.56 --> 6106.56
all of us into his virtual necessary

6104.84 --> 6108.96
enemy because

6106.56 --> 6111.04
he's still trapped behind the fences and

6108.96 --> 6114.88
he's just lashing out

6111.04 --> 6115.36
trying to say ha i've won i've won see

6114.88 --> 6117.4400000000005
because

6115.36 --> 6118.4
i can just scatter gun you with saying

6117.44 --> 6120.48
things

6118.4 --> 6122.48
to distract away from the actual

6120.48 --> 6125.119
arguments just handed over to me

6122.48 --> 6127.04
that disprove i'm living on a ball but

6125.119 --> 6129.5199999999995
i'm still living on a ball

6127.04 --> 6131.6
because i can't handle seeing it any

6129.52 --> 6133.6
other way

6131.6 --> 6136.2390000000005
so i'm just gonna scatter gun all of you

6133.6 --> 6139.52
and just tell you how stupid you are

6136.239 --> 6142.159
for not being in that same fenced off

6139.52 --> 6142.159000000001
slave pit

6143.04 --> 6149.84
right banana

6152.88 --> 6156.88
the horizon is behind the rig yeah

6154.8 --> 6160.400000000001
that's right

6156.88 --> 6163.92
that at the apparent location

6160.4 --> 6166.5599999999995
of the horizon is behind the oil rig

6163.92 --> 6168.08
even though it was an extremely low

6166.56 --> 6170.8
observation height

6168.08 --> 6172.88
height right or with extreme low

6170.8 --> 6175.6
observation height what normally happens

6172.88 --> 6176.88
when you're on a geometry geometric

6175.6 --> 6180.08
surface

6176.88 --> 6181.52
is that that means

6180.08 --> 6183.199
that what you're going to see is going

6181.52 --> 6186.2390000000005
to be obstructed

6183.199 --> 6187.199
very close by because the sphere is

6186.239 --> 6189.199
getting in the way

6187.199 --> 6191.839999999999
and a low observation height yet it

6189.199 --> 6191.839999999999
didn't

6192.48 --> 6198.638999999999
because those platforms were very far

6195.679 --> 6200.719
away with the horizon behind it

6198.639 --> 6202.32
and it should not have been visible at

6200.719 --> 6205.199
all

6202.32 --> 6205.84
you should have just seen maybe like one

6205.199 --> 6209.36
of the

6205.84 --> 6211.6
topies of the towers stick out at best

6209.36 --> 6213.119
maybe nothing just nothing just a bulge

6211.6 --> 6216.2390000000005
you're staring at

6213.119 --> 6218.96
if it was actually a geometrical sphere

6216.239 --> 6220.638999999999
you were looking over at that extremely

6218.96 --> 6222.719
low observation i'd yet

6220.639 --> 6223.76
it was fully visible right there in the

6222.719 --> 6226.56
distance

6223.76 --> 6227.92
that's impossible when you look over a

6226.56 --> 6229.76
geometric sphere

6227.92 --> 6231.679
the geometry would get in the way it

6229.76 --> 6234.400000000001
would obstruct what you would see

6231.679 --> 6234.4
but it didn't

6234.96 --> 6238.8
there is no justification for that on

6237.04 --> 6240.639
the sphere at all and that's called the

6238.8 --> 6244.159000000001
black swan argument

6240.639 --> 6247.28
there is no spherical geometry

6244.159 --> 6249.44
obstructing things in the distance

6247.28 --> 6250.88
the horizon is not a sphere edge that's

6249.44 --> 6253.599999999999
blocking things

6250.88 --> 6256.400000000001
it's an apparent location where the sky

6253.6 --> 6256.400000000001
meets the ground

6257.679 --> 6261.84
it's not a sphere edge

6274.639 --> 6277.84
now he's just trying to squirt make you

6276.56 --> 6280.400000000001
all squirt guys

6277.84 --> 6281.679
just ignore him he's constantly

6280.4 --> 6283.599999999999
addressing everybody

6281.679 --> 6285.6
except me of course not the show host

6283.6 --> 6289.1990000000005
that's actually addressing him

6285.6 --> 6303.84
so just let him let him squirt

6289.199 --> 6303.839999999999
it's not doing anything

6307.679 --> 6311.84
this is yeah sure we do yeah if we're

6309.52 --> 6313.92
moving it's just see it's just a real

6311.84 --> 6316.08
it's chanting he's chanting as nathan

6313.92 --> 6318.96
won't call it

6316.08 --> 6321.76
just reasserting all the points that are

6318.96 --> 6325.36
very blatantly disproven

6321.76 --> 6327.76
empirical based facts and just saying no

6325.36 --> 6331.839999999999
it is true it is true

6327.76 --> 6331.84
yeah that's what they do

6332.0 --> 6336.719
it's what would you do if you got a

6333.679 --> 6336.719
banana in your eye

6338.239 --> 6345.839999999999
like this guy

6355.36 --> 6359.28
see he's he just he's jealous of nathan

6358.08 --> 6362.4
he wants to be

6359.28 --> 6366.0
nathan he wants to be in that position

6362.4 --> 6367.839999999999
where he can be very strict

6366.0 --> 6369.6
towards people that are being very

6367.84 --> 6372.8
stupid and not getting it he's just

6369.6 --> 6376.2390000000005
jealous of nathan so he's now enacting

6372.8 --> 6378.0
like he is nathan but from his virtual

6376.239 --> 6380.4
baller perspective so he's

6378.0 --> 6382.08
trying to enact like he's nathan towards

6380.4 --> 6384.5599999999995
the flat earthers

6382.08 --> 6385.5199999999995
think that that works it's just trying

6384.56 --> 6388.320000000001
to

6385.52 --> 6390.2390000000005
change reality so that he can have it

6388.32 --> 6392.48
all for the ball

6390.239 --> 6395.44
instead of against the ball so the

6392.48 --> 6398.5599999999995
mental gymnastics he's playing

6395.44 --> 6402.799999999999
this is special

6398.56 --> 6402.8
very special very creepy

6403.199 --> 6408.638999999999
but that's what they all want that's

6404.96 --> 6412.08
they all have a rage boner for nathan

6408.639 --> 6414.4800000000005
because they want to be exactly

6412.08 --> 6416.0
like that towards other people and have

6414.48 --> 6418.48
it justified have it be

6416.0 --> 6420.719
applauded it's such a power position to

6418.48 --> 6420.718999999999
them

6420.8 --> 6425.4800000000005
they don't understand that it's that

6423.76 --> 6429.84
power position

6425.48 --> 6433.199
because you believe in the ball

6429.84 --> 6434.719
that's the reason why it works the way

6433.199 --> 6438.32
it does

6434.719 --> 6442.4
you can't attain that sort of

6438.32 --> 6445.759999999999
social status position act

6442.4 --> 6448.879999999999
way of doing things with

6445.76 --> 6452.08
the ball as your foundation

6448.88 --> 6454.8
that is impossible it can never be

6452.08 --> 6456.48
attained so you will spend years and

6454.8 --> 6458.719
years squirting every day

6456.48 --> 6460.08
trying to make it like that because you

6458.719 --> 6463.6
can't accept

6460.08 --> 6466.719
that that position can only be achieved

6463.6 --> 6469.04
by abandoning that ball

6466.719 --> 6470.88
because it's not real then then you

6469.04 --> 6472.48
could potentially enact that

6470.88 --> 6474.8
but as soon as you would you would have

6472.48 --> 6477.44
to deal with the demoralization of

6474.8 --> 6479.119000000001
getting over the ball first

6477.44 --> 6480.32
and that's going to change everything so

6479.119 --> 6481.679
you're just not going to do it you're

6480.32 --> 6484.32
just going to keep on

6481.679 --> 6485.52
pretending like you can attain that

6484.32 --> 6489.28
position from

6485.52 --> 6494.0
from a baller foundation you can't

6489.28 --> 6496.8
you can only scatter gun gaslight

6494.0 --> 6497.76
bluff your way through like you are on

6496.8 --> 6499.6
the winning side

6497.76 --> 6501.360000000001
it's not convincing anybody it's just

6499.6 --> 6502.8
convincing you and people that

6501.36 --> 6504.32
want to believe that you're on the

6502.8 --> 6505.119000000001
winning side because they haven't looked

6504.32 --> 6507.28
into it

6505.119 --> 6509.36
and to us it's just going to be annoying

6507.28 --> 6512.4
and arrogant and it'll trigger us

6509.36 --> 6516.0
slightly but not as much

6512.4 --> 6518.799999999999
now because i'm explaining exactly

6516.0 --> 6520.32
what is happening right here in their

6518.8 --> 6523.76
mind

6520.32 --> 6527.119
just keep on scatter gunning more prefab

6523.76 --> 6529.2390000000005
nonsense facts

6527.119 --> 6530.719
that they've just swiped together

6529.239 --> 6532.638999999999
improvisingly

6530.719 --> 6534.88
to get through something then they have

6532.639 --> 6536.719
a filler to present they got a lot of

6534.88 --> 6537.52
filler it was all addressed all

6536.719 --> 6539.6
dispelled

6537.52 --> 6541.280000000001
but they'll ignore that part and just

6539.6 --> 6544.0
recycle everything

6541.28 --> 6544.8
so they can scatter gun everyone with

6544.0 --> 6547.28
nonsense

6544.8 --> 6549.76
filler supposed facts that aren't

6547.28 --> 6551.599999999999
actually facts it's all [Â __Â ]

6549.76 --> 6554.56
and often doesn't even have anything to

6551.6 --> 6557.52
do with proving the shape

6554.56 --> 6559.280000000001
it's just to them they remember it as

6557.52 --> 6562.320000000001
that they took it as a virtual

6559.28 --> 6562.32
fact and a win

6562.4 --> 6565.5199999999995
and they hold on to that virtual fact

6564.8 --> 6567.92
and win

6565.52 --> 6571.280000000001
and scattergun everybody with it even

6567.92 --> 6571.28
though it's complete nonsense

6571.599 --> 6575.4400000000005
and that way they can fill their day

6573.199 --> 6580.159
with just scatter gunning nonsense

6575.44 --> 6582.48
red herrings move away from the question

6580.159 --> 6584.32
step away from the question bring up

6582.48 --> 6585.919999999999
something new scatter gunning again

6584.32 --> 6587.84
keep on scatter gunning because as soon

6585.92 --> 6590.56
as somebody addresses anything you say

6587.84 --> 6592.719
it's all over so keep scatter gunning

6590.56 --> 6595.92
the red herrings the gas lightings

6592.719 --> 6596.4
and just be very proud of how fast you

6595.92 --> 6598.56
are

6596.4 --> 6599.92
in spouting out this nonsense and that

6598.56 --> 6602.639
you're kind of like

6599.92 --> 6603.119
overwhelming everybody with how quick

6602.639 --> 6605.92
you are

6603.119 --> 6607.28
to spout out all your nonsense and then

6605.92 --> 6610.4800000000005
you're very proud of that

6607.28 --> 6612.4
we know because it gives you the feeling

6610.48 --> 6615.839999999999
like i was quicker than you

6612.4 --> 6618.0
not correct but quicker in asserting my

6615.84 --> 6620.0
nonsense and that tires out people and

6618.0 --> 6623.04
then i feel wow i'm so quick

6620.0 --> 6626.4
i'm so quick at doing my nonsense

6623.04 --> 6628.08
that i think is real it's awesome

6626.4 --> 6629.679
and then you have your your moment of

6628.08 --> 6631.44
squirt for the day

6629.679 --> 6633.1990000000005
i don't know maybe you need it all of

6631.44 --> 6636.08
the day probably just

6633.199 --> 6639.839999999999
a few times a day right that's your way

6636.08 --> 6639.84
to squirt

6641.119 --> 6645.28
he probably has it on mute i'm pretty

6644.08 --> 6648.0
sure banana eye has

6645.28 --> 6649.119
my show on mute so he can't hear what

6652.239 --> 6656.08
and you can use what i'm saying to

6655.04 --> 6659.84

6656.08 --> 6661.84
funny what he's trying to say

6659.84 --> 6663.119000000001

6661.84 --> 6665.4400000000005
addressing me

6663.119 --> 6666.48
because he knows i'm absolutely
