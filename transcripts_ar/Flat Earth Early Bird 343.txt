that will be much appreciated so today

73.92 --> 81.89
the weather is almost same as yesterday

76.95 --> 81.89
it's just a little bit more windy and a

82.19 --> 85.52
lot of chemtrails

93.74 --> 98.72999999999999
it what I went out in the city and was

96.42 --> 106.08
really crowded everywhere early in the

98.73 --> 110.16
morning there was weird apparently there

106.08 --> 113.87
was this giant hardcore party that went

110.16 --> 119.14999999999999
down in some stadium in Utrecht and

113.87 --> 119.15
there were like hardcore dressed people

119.57 --> 128.98999999999998
like roaming around with headaches and

122.37 --> 128.99
such this was it was funny to see mm-hmm

130.85 --> 137.32999999999998
so yeah that's just something that

133.29 --> 137.32999999999998
happened in town here mm-hmm

137.36 --> 142.05
ha hey Colin dresser yeah you like the

141.3 --> 145.11
new look

142.05 --> 149.82000000000002
a Tammy confound it and I'm probably

145.11 --> 153.71
gonna I'm good I have plans to Adam some

149.82 --> 157.82
more but I don't know how to do it yet

153.71 --> 162.739
but I don't have a Skyrim installation

157.82 --> 162.739
anyway yeah I'm gonna go through Chet

164.72 --> 167.759
[Music]

168.28 --> 181.33
right so Amanda um was first more

172.7 --> 184.22
colored Steve righteous force dank ATM

181.33 --> 186.85000000000002
call address her George Sand Ford

184.22 --> 186.85
paulcurran

188.77 --> 192.23000000000002
is this spherical called bass that's

191.69 --> 196.91
hilarious

192.23 --> 200.0
uh a sleeping warrior the pop goes the

196.91 --> 205.60999999999999
model yeah that was your video yesterday

200.0 --> 212.99
was hilarious more color it's Michael

205.61 --> 221.21
Roark good servants yeah good to see you

212.99 --> 223.13
all so yeah today Sunday suddenly the

221.21 --> 228.16
clocks have all changed all of a sudden

223.13 --> 232.04
everywhere so it's actually earlier now

228.16 --> 235.79
than it normally is and yeah I heard it

232.04 --> 239.59
changed in England and Eastern Europe as

235.79 --> 239.59
well so it's just a Europe region

240.19 --> 249.4
maybe Africa so I don't know no idea but

244.82 --> 249.4
yeah the time zones have changed so I

249.79 --> 257.93
had got note that the time zone zones

254.63 --> 262.82
changed in the Australia region a few

257.93 --> 266.21
days before so I don't know when the

262.82 --> 268.63
when America is gonna the America region

266.21 --> 271.64
is gonna change the time zone

268.63 --> 272.63
either later or a day for already done

271.64 --> 283.47999999999996
it a lot sooner

272.63 --> 283.48
I don't know anyway what's going down

298.25 --> 302.08
and what hangover poker and

307.6 --> 312.97
you mean from the premiere on ball

310.27 --> 315.96999999999997
busters yesterday that was recorded like

312.97 --> 318.13000000000005
weeks ago no I don't have a hangover

315.97 --> 332.129
from then

318.13 --> 332.129
[Music]

340.0 --> 349.129
mm-hmm anyway yeah I've read before this

344.599 --> 351.43899999999996
eye and yesterday spread out throughout

349.129 --> 353.87
the day yesterday it was kind of a messy

351.439 --> 359.81
day for me did all kinds of things at

353.87 --> 364.729
the same time and but yeah watched Owen

359.81 --> 368.84
Benjamin and he's just full-on just

364.729 --> 372.039
putting it baseline Flat Earth now it's

368.84 --> 372.039
pretty astounding

372.08 --> 381.37899999999996
[Music]

375.55 --> 383.659
so yeah I'd wonder if if he would ever

381.379 --> 387.59000000000003
consider for example coming on the Flat

383.659 --> 391.039
Earth debates as a challenge maybe maybe

387.59 --> 396.67999999999995
not but that would be funny I think he

391.039 --> 400.659
could probably do it now now he doesn't

396.68 --> 404.33
like just a lot of the behavior that

400.659 --> 410.12
involves Flat Earth because not all

404.33 --> 412.219
flatterers are just doing it right a lot

410.12 --> 422.33
are getting dragged into bad social

412.219 --> 426.259
behavior so but yeah I wonder if he if

422.33 --> 428.599
he'd find the debates interesting enough

426.259 --> 432.439
maybe de to have some criticism or

428.599 --> 437.77
something I don't know but yeah so far

432.439 --> 441.469
he's sticking to David ysus material and

437.77 --> 448.96
what he taps into and hey that's good

441.469 --> 448.96
enough you know we'll see where he goes

454.47 --> 464.41
yeah maybe kamikaze Gilmore if the thing

458.29 --> 466.51000000000005
is I wonder if he'd had the time because

464.41 --> 468.13000000000005
he if I wouldn't Benjamin would be on

466.51 --> 479.95
the panel he's not just gonna sit back

468.13 --> 481.93
and maybe one time do it but I do wonder

479.95 --> 484.33
sometimes like would he be listening to

481.93 --> 487.81
that stuff while he was working in the

484.33 --> 491.59
garden I could imagine it would be in a

487.81 --> 494.89
way very stimulating I think there's a

491.59 --> 498.09999999999997
lot of people that do work while

494.89 --> 502.0
listening to the Flat Earth debates it

498.1 --> 506.68
fires them up so maybe he's doing that

502.0 --> 509.88
as well I don't know anyway it's the

506.68 --> 513.16
whole ego so well it could clash but

509.88 --> 516.55
look Owen Benjamin's not an idiot he

513.16 --> 518.8
knows about his ego nathan is also very

516.55 --> 521.14
aware about his ego he wouldn't

518.8 --> 525.6899999999999
necessarily clash but there could be a

521.14 --> 525.6899999999999
risk of course that's yeah

528.11 --> 533.32
I don't know

535.28 --> 545.9599999999999
anyway just it's it's good to see him do

540.17 --> 551.8299999999999
that do his flatter thing and it's funny

545.96 --> 554.6600000000001
away because I address and talk about

551.83 --> 557.9300000000001
like the trolls for example and their

554.66 --> 561.11
tactics and their beliefs a lot what

557.93 --> 563.06
they tried to do on the spot and on

561.11 --> 571.46
Benjamin does that in his own way as

563.06 --> 575.0899999999999
well only his own approach and it's

571.46 --> 578.21
interesting to see how how he's

575.09 --> 582.8000000000001
sharpening his insights on what they're

578.21 --> 585.4100000000001
doing of sharpening well he got it he

582.8 --> 592.78
gets the gist of it most of it

585.41 --> 592.78
and ya know just

594.61 --> 598.9300000000001
it's interesting the way he puts it out

596.709 --> 601.9499999999999
and yeah it gives me something to

598.93 --> 606.1899999999999
reflect upon the way I put it out anyway

601.95 --> 610.69
yeah there was some some great new video

606.19 --> 618.19
yesterday from was it chocolate say and

610.69 --> 624.1600000000001
again just found it all right very old

618.19 --> 627.3900000000001
video about entropy it was a really good

624.16 --> 627.39
video let's see

630.97 --> 641.14
if I can maybe present some of the

634.24 --> 644.32
although it is like 35 minutes long but

641.14 --> 645.9
it's a very elaborate presentation from

644.32 --> 651.3100000000001
the 50s or something

645.9 --> 653.77
by an awesome old teacher or he talks

651.31 --> 656.16
about entropy in every conceivable way

653.77 --> 660.64
and it's really well done

656.16 --> 664.17
there's no globe nonsense in there it's

660.64 --> 668.53
just not on his mind is not focused on

664.17 --> 671.8
on any cosmic cosmic gonacl.com to me

668.53 --> 675.9399999999999
and it's awesome you know what I'll just

671.8 --> 681.43
put it out in chat it's definitely worth

675.94 --> 684.9000000000001
taking a look at it's a video posted by

681.43 --> 684.9
Chris pillow

685.05 --> 688.16
[Music]

688.629 --> 696.37
yeah from Professor George Porter an

693.73 --> 703.91
introduction to chemical change and

696.37 --> 705.889
thermodynamics so yeah take a look at it

703.91 --> 709.399
it's good yeah

705.889 --> 712.009
I expected it's gonna be used maybe it

709.399 --> 718.36
globe Buster's or maybe at the debates

712.009 --> 718.36
tomorrow because it's very good video

718.4 --> 721.51
[Music]

730.11 --> 733.11
mm-hm

741.2 --> 744.2
yeah

750.51 --> 756.399
yeah it's true it's true more colored

753.82 --> 760.6
I've been trying to point at that as

756.399 --> 763.95
well it's look you can just break the

760.6 --> 766.51
globe apart very quickly using

763.95 --> 769.75
foundational logic like second law of

766.51 --> 772.81
thermodynamics got the space vacuum a

769.75 --> 775.18
fast-paced vacuum next to a very small

772.81 --> 776.7399999999999
area where there's gas pressure just

775.18 --> 781.75
built up and stable that that's

776.74 --> 784.42
impossible but yeah I have entertained

781.75 --> 787.24
the presuppositional system of their

784.42 --> 789.91
model and then even when you do that

787.24 --> 792.64
even as you dig through and honestly try

789.91 --> 794.62
to build the arguments presupposing a

792.64 --> 797.17
lot of foundational arguments that have

794.62 --> 801.43
no standing but still bypassing that all

797.17 --> 805.0889999999999
then you still find that how they

801.43 --> 807.55
perceive from above all the forces that

805.089 --> 810.7790000000001
are present in the in reality that

807.55 --> 813.79
gravity is a weak force and even

810.779 --> 815.92
presupposing all of it all of it that

813.79 --> 820.0889999999999
every the gravity whatever it's supposed

815.92 --> 824.0799999999999
to be some kind of sphere achill set

820.089 --> 825.85
spiracle centrical force you know if you

824.08 --> 829.0600000000001
presuppose all of these things then

825.85 --> 832.33
still it just the gravity is not strong

829.06 --> 836.65
enough to keep the gas pressure to stuck

832.33 --> 838.51
to the earth and I've even earlier Leon

836.65 --> 840.37
I'm talking about two years ago said

838.51 --> 843.459
what the consequence would be it would

840.37 --> 847.74
be an outer gas universe with a slightly

843.459 --> 852.3389999999999
thicker atmosphere on the earth then

847.74 --> 854.85
surrounding it in the entire cosmos that

852.339 --> 858.7900000000001
would be the consequence in their

854.85 --> 861.97
presuppositional foundational logic and

858.79 --> 865.48
that's just the silly thing that now

861.97 --> 870.399
what we see their model is so blatantly

865.48 --> 874.7090000000001
broken like they're trying to build

870.399 --> 877.6
something with worn-out warped legos and

874.709 --> 880.8389999999999
even as they're trying to build

877.6 --> 882.19
something then even what they built even

880.839 --> 884.1700000000001
if the legos would not have

882.19 --> 886.24
been warped it still would just

884.17 --> 889.27
naturally collapse because it was a bad

886.24 --> 892.48
design that's what the globe is it's so

889.27 --> 895.63
messed up and weirdly enough there they

892.48 --> 898.33
still defend it reason doesn't seem to

895.63 --> 900.61
be involved in in the defense and then

898.33 --> 902.9200000000001
what they try to do is guess like

900.61 --> 906.4300000000001
flat-earthers by trying to suggest that

902.92 --> 909.8499999999999
that that their default position is

906.43 --> 911.62
actually what the default position of

909.85 --> 914.89
flat earthers are they tried to Gaslight

911.62 --> 919.99
us with their desperate situation that

914.89 --> 922.56
they have and projected onto us to just

919.99 --> 925.63
get a glimpse of an idea of a victory

922.56 --> 930.1199999999999
that is exactly the opposite of reality

925.63 --> 930.12
and that's what we get a lot these days

933.45 --> 944.5600000000001
it's a total reversed world gaslighting

939.09 --> 947.59
they project onto us their doom in order

944.56 --> 952.3
to try to escape the realization that

947.59 --> 958.62
they are doomed in their assertions it's

952.3 --> 958.62
very ironic but it's also very annoying

960.18 --> 966.01
it's like constant death screeching

963.52 --> 970.71
everywhere there's nothing you can

966.01 --> 970.71
really do to stop it or anything

974.2 --> 978.49
anyway yeah

989.13 --> 994.77
all right we're colored yeah it's always

991.53 --> 999.11
about the superficial looks isn't it the

994.77 --> 1002.0
globe the entire globe concept it all

999.11 --> 1004.94
weighs heavily on the first impression

1002.0 --> 1009.53
and what the imagination naturally tends

1004.94 --> 1012.9100000000001
to do with it and they guide the not the

1009.53 --> 1016.16
how the consciousness chooses things

1012.91 --> 1020.11
within that discovery process very early

1016.16 --> 1023.66
on it's the fairy the guided super-young

1020.11 --> 1026.18
indoctrination part so they give us

1023.66 --> 1029.6
already that they hand us the tools at a

1026.18 --> 1032.39
very young age that we need to do and it

1029.6 --> 1034.9699999999998
makes it made me it's a very young kid

1032.39 --> 1038.3600000000001
feel extremely adult like oh my god I'm

1034.97 --> 1040.6100000000001
actually getting the official adult

1038.36 --> 1046.9399999999998
rules that's what I thought was

1040.61 --> 1050.3
happening so I took it big time but I

1046.94 --> 1053.53
didn't see of course that that yeah the

1050.3 --> 1053.53
world doesn't work that way

1061.82 --> 1068.81
yeah and as you take it they program you

1065.27 --> 1071.78
as you take it as a kid super serious as

1068.81 --> 1075.32
a big-time adult information initiation

1071.78 --> 1078.05
or whatever of the information you then

1075.32 --> 1080.33
are so open so strong that you are

1078.05 --> 1082.8799999999999
programmable and they will program you

1080.33 --> 1089.3
exactly as designated exactly with the

1082.88 --> 1091.96
tools specially designed to guide your

1089.3 --> 1095.05
train of thought concerning these things

1091.96 --> 1100.3400000000001
that's what they do in that age category

1095.05 --> 1102.8
through the energies through a false

1100.34 --> 1105.1599999999999
initiation in a way the initiation in

1102.8 --> 1105.1599999999999
the lie

1109.79 --> 1119.84
yeah it's very devious really it's weird

1115.52 --> 1121.94
because every mechanism that is involved

1119.84 --> 1125.9299999999998
in the globe indoctrination is pretty

1121.94 --> 1129.1100000000001
devious like it's never really good the

1125.93 --> 1133.22
good is always a cover to protect from

1129.11 --> 1136.7299999999998
the dark sides of it and that's what I

1133.22 --> 1140.18
bumped into as well a lot when I started

1136.73 --> 1142.52
to figure out that just some things more

1140.18 --> 1144.3200000000002
improvised people weren't always being

1142.52 --> 1150.07
told the truth it seems to be more

1144.32 --> 1153.77
dependent on what the person being asked

1150.07 --> 1157.04
could put out how they could put it

1153.77 --> 1159.59
together so it seemed to be much more

1157.04 --> 1162.23
human dependent the vision in the story

1159.59 --> 1166.36
then actual technical dependent although

1162.23 --> 1169.28
they have some technical guidelines some

1166.36 --> 1176.6
stuff they would have to presuppose have

1169.28 --> 1177.77
to hold on to in their things and but

1176.6 --> 1180.6499999999999
that bump yeah

1177.77 --> 1182.66
when eventually I thought at first like

1180.65 --> 1185.21
I it's all just necessary you know it's

1182.66 --> 1187.22
the only way you can make it work but I

1185.21 --> 1189.26
didn't realize that the only way it

1187.22 --> 1192.08
could be made to work that way is

1189.26 --> 1197.78
because it was all a lie I didn't

1192.08 --> 1200.6299999999999
realize that it was very tough to

1197.78 --> 1203.78
already be part of something in a way be

1200.63 --> 1205.7900000000002
behind something work with it try to do

1203.78 --> 1211.24
it yourself trying to become part of it

1205.79 --> 1214.07
and you find things you don't like in it

1211.24 --> 1216.29
try to find the think of alternatives

1214.07 --> 1218.54
for how to do that and then eventually

1216.29 --> 1220.6599999999999
you'll just figure out that it is all a

1218.54 --> 1225.4099999999999
lie

1220.66 --> 1227.5400000000002
and that people in their personal

1225.41 --> 1231.47
beliefs about it are even extremely

1227.54 --> 1234.23
divided within seems to be more

1231.47 --> 1238.94
politically driven than really personal

1234.23 --> 1243.14
inspiration driven so yeah it's just

1238.94 --> 1243.53
there was nothing for me that I could do

1243.14 --> 1245.9
with

1243.53 --> 1248.6299999999999
that would hold the ground that would

1245.9 --> 1252.25
mean it would just eat away at me

1248.63 --> 1255.95
year after year if I'd gone on that path

1252.25 --> 1263.75
then I'd have nothing of the spirit that

1255.95 --> 1266.48
I have now if I had and I felt that even

1263.75 --> 1272.27
though I still believed in the ball and

1266.48 --> 1276.5
you imagined that even if I found out

1272.27 --> 1278.6
that it was basically [ __ ] what they

1276.5 --> 1282.14
were shoving in our faces I still

1278.6 --> 1285.1699999999998
believed that that was just a cover for

1282.14 --> 1288.38
it really being there and just being too

1285.17 --> 1290.21
complicated or that they don't want they

1288.38 --> 1293.5700000000002
didn't want to be embarrassed by their

1290.21 --> 1295.43
shortcomings or maybe some covert [ __ ]

1293.57 --> 1297.74
that made it very very hard that could

1295.43 --> 1301.52
not be revealed all these excuses would

1297.74 --> 1304.34
pop up in my mind in order to justify

1301.52 --> 1309.23
that there might still be a globe in a

1304.34 --> 1311.33
way after all and that the NASA stuff

1309.23 --> 1317.24
and the so-called proof given to the

1311.33 --> 1320.84
world was just a a messy nonsense to

1317.24 --> 1323.99
cover for the real truth that it still

1320.84 --> 1327.08
was out there it just was very confusing

1323.99 --> 1328.97
see it becomes very confusing when you

1327.08 --> 1331.4299999999998
keep on believing and then then try to

1328.97 --> 1336.08
try to justify everything that surrounds

1331.43 --> 1337.73
it and eventually you run into a halt it

1336.08 --> 1341.48
just gives you a headache and it's just

1337.73 --> 1344.27
like that it's so chaotic I can't can't

1341.48 --> 1347.33
oversee the reason or what it's is and

1344.27 --> 1353.3
and left it alone for a long time and

1347.33 --> 1355.6699999999998
then in 2015 eventually I started to

1353.3 --> 1358.18
yeah I bumped into the freaking flares

1355.67 --> 1363.5500000000002
again and it seemed to be much more open

1358.18 --> 1363.55
platform now all of a sudden

1364.46 --> 1371.179
and then I finally felt like okay maybe

1368.419 --> 1376.94
I can now try to approach the whole

1371.179 --> 1378.6190000000001
thing as if it really were a lie for

1376.94 --> 1382.3690000000001
real that the globe might actually not

1378.619 --> 1384.9499999999998
be real maybe that way I can figure out

1382.369 --> 1387.369
whether if it might still be out there

1384.95 --> 1387.3690000000001
or not

1393.3 --> 1399.75
and then as I literally open up to a new

1396.27 --> 1402.18
foundation of approach yeah

1399.75 --> 1403.89
certainly the admits conceptions about

1402.18 --> 1406.17
flat earthers what they believe about

1403.89 --> 1408.69
the lit map being literal and all that

1406.17 --> 1412.38
that of course bummed I bumped into that

1408.69 --> 1415.53
very annoying made me less comfortable

1412.38 --> 1419.63
with the whole thing but also learning

1415.53 --> 1422.7
about physics so much from a fresh

1419.63 --> 1424.92
foundational perspective and then it

1422.7 --> 1427.8300000000002
really I really understood the physics

1424.92 --> 1430.2
so much better than I did before it

1427.83 --> 1433.56
wasn't some conceptual framework anymore

1430.2 --> 1438.42
I could literally just apply it now to

1433.56 --> 1440.54
the world in so many ways and yeah that

1438.42 --> 1442.74
made it very apparent that

1440.54 --> 1445.94
presuppositional assertions at some

1442.74 --> 1448.6200000000001
points are just better abandoned and

1445.94 --> 1451.29
that's when I figured out wait note it

1448.62 --> 1454.6499999999999
there really is no chance that the globe

1451.29 --> 1462.48
is real in that sense there's just no

1454.65 --> 1465.6000000000001
chance yeah and the overall chance that

1462.48 --> 1470.31
the world the realm is just very surreal

1465.6 --> 1472.8
in nature is much higher than the idea

1470.31 --> 1474.54
of the literal globe earth and the

1472.8 --> 1476.75
mechanics that all supposed to make that

1474.54 --> 1476.75
happen

1481.7 --> 1490.04
but I could only really reach that

1483.89 --> 1493.16
conclusion when I first was able to

1490.04 --> 1498.3999999999999
really honestly try to build a new angle

1493.16 --> 1505.01
of approach in the foundation to really

1498.4 --> 1509.5400000000002
build from a flat earth perspective but

1505.01 --> 1511.34
to not let the globe conceptualization

1509.54 --> 1512.45
mechanic in our minds it get involved

1511.34 --> 1514.9399999999998
with it anymore

1512.45 --> 1519.3500000000001
and that's yeah that's when it really

1514.94 --> 1523.3700000000001
became dispelled that's when the

1519.35 --> 1527.33
mechanics were identified in my mind as

1523.37 --> 1530.06
a neurotic building process like a game

1527.33 --> 1532.0
that's very tough to let go that you're

1530.06 --> 1535.28
not really informed it's a game but

1532.0 --> 1539.39
you'd play it like a game and everybody

1535.28 --> 1542.03
knows how to play that game and people

1539.39 --> 1543.7700000000002
that play the room very well are honored

1542.03 --> 1545.84
and put on the media and all that and

1543.77 --> 1547.91
that's how they that's how the globe

1545.84 --> 1552.3799999999999
idea and the mechanics of it all work

1547.91 --> 1555.67
it's again it's practically treated as a

1552.38 --> 1555.67
personal mind game

1561.38 --> 1572.65
yeah yeah rambling on a bit yeah

1585.37 --> 1595.6299999999999
EMF what electromagnetic frequency what

1590.68 --> 1597.22
does that got to do with gravity you

1595.63 --> 1602.89
don't know what causes the relative

1597.22 --> 1606.22
density alignment you don't know Casey

1602.89 --> 1610.0300000000002
Jones I know that's many flat earthers

1606.22 --> 1613.39
have suggested conceptualized that

1610.03 --> 1616.18
gravity may be caused by something like

1613.39 --> 1618.76
an electro polarized electrostatics

1616.18 --> 1621.18
whatever all all kinds of possibilities

1618.76 --> 1623.32
but it's all just come presuppositional

1621.18 --> 1625.98
conceptualizations it's not been

1623.32 --> 1625.98
confirmed

1633.46 --> 1639.43
it's just more like oh look models oh

1636.31 --> 1643.74
this is how it looks like oh this just

1639.43 --> 1648.22
happens to look exactly how we

1643.74 --> 1651.04
forcefully literal eyes the map and its

1648.22 --> 1653.8600000000001
shape because of that so that fits so

1651.04 --> 1655.8999999999999
that is proof that we are right because

1653.86 --> 1658.2099999999998
it makes perfect sense because the

1655.9 --> 1660.8500000000001
pattern of the magnetics correlates

1658.21 --> 1666.93
exactly with how we presuppose the earth

1660.85 --> 1666.9299999999998
to be yeah that

1674.57 --> 1679.549
[Music]

1680.56 --> 1687.19
[Applause]

1683.24 --> 1690.95
[Music]

1687.19 --> 1695.8400000000001
now really really Casey Jones land mass

1690.95 --> 1701.809
is the earth land mass is flat the earth

1695.84 --> 1708.02
is half a sphere really explain that to

1701.809 --> 1709.539
me because that's a contradiction in

1708.02 --> 1713.74
terms

1709.539 --> 1717.02
if you're gonna say it's a sphere then

1713.74 --> 1721.27
it's not going to be flat even if it is

1717.02 --> 1721.27
half a sphere if you're gonna say that

1721.539 --> 1730.82
the realm shape is irregular and worked

1726.47 --> 1734.27
in a specific way and it's all flat now

1730.82 --> 1737.059
there I can go with you that falls right

1734.27 --> 1738.83
into the ally of the conceptualization

1737.059 --> 1745.19
that the realm maybe have looping

1738.83 --> 1750.07
aspects going with the baseline that it

1745.19 --> 1750.0700000000002
definitely all is flat geometrically so

1754.1 --> 1765.33
surrounding the earth Oh surrounding you

1758.34 --> 1772.97
say surrounding where and how would you

1765.33 --> 1772.97
know it would be there where yeah

1802.06 --> 1808.51
nopal kuren I don't think a spherical

1805.46 --> 1814.49
compass would scream the true shape I

1808.51 --> 1816.35
did I don't think that a foot like a

1814.49 --> 1820.45
soccer ball

1816.35 --> 1820.4499999999998
screams the true shape either

1830.99 --> 1833.8
yeah

1836.88 --> 1842.239
pay snack do the future

1839.22 --> 1842.239
[Music]

1861.84 --> 1868.08
oh right well mark does air something

1865.74 --> 1870.48
you don't understand is that yeah well

1868.08 --> 1873.06
if you're going to be presupposing that

1870.48 --> 1875.43
both Sun and Moon are in literal

1873.06 --> 1878.75
position circling over the presupposed

1875.43 --> 1882.8400000000001
disc earth then how do eclipses work

1878.75 --> 1884.87
yeah duh doesn't really work when you're

1882.84 --> 1887.76
out presupposing all that now does it

1884.87 --> 1889.9799999999998
because it's all presuppose there's no

1887.76 --> 1893.12
proof that it is in any physical literal

1889.98 --> 1895.89
location now if you take away any

1893.12 --> 1897.6899999999998
physicality assumption bias concerning

1895.89 --> 1901.17
the heavenly bodies including the Sun

1897.69 --> 1904.3200000000002
and the moon then suddenly and light

1901.17 --> 1909.18
based unusual phenomena like an eclipse

1904.32 --> 1911.76
becomes well just as mysterious but

1909.18 --> 1914.3700000000001
still like yeah it's of course it's a

1911.76 --> 1922.43
light phenomenon it's like it's very

1914.37 --> 1926.9699999999998
specific to the location and yeah I

1922.43 --> 1930.75
don't have to make it work because there

1926.97 --> 1935.22
is no no physical assumptions that I

1930.75 --> 1939.27
have to justify to explain the sighting

1935.22 --> 1942.8600000000001
of the eclipses because I'm not assuming

1939.27 --> 1942.86
that they're physical objects

1949.72 --> 1952.829
[Music]

1956.0 --> 1965.1
we'll pass away - do I think mark

1959.64 --> 1967.17
Sargent is a shell oh man you must have

1965.1 --> 1971.7199999999998
thought about that question for a very

1967.17 --> 1981.1200000000001
long time it's so original Wow

1971.72 --> 1983.79
well a shield for what passivate oh you

1981.12 --> 1990.8999999999999
know technically that a question like

1983.79 --> 1998.04
that is like does that person have a job

1990.9 --> 2002.3600000000001
or does he make a living it's not very

1998.04 --> 2006.3799999999999
specific so what she'll what why how

2002.36 --> 2010.4799999999998
what is he shilling for maybe he is like

2006.38 --> 2013.3700000000001
shilling is basically a sales technique

2010.48 --> 2016.69
so what is he selling

2013.37 --> 2019.58
well if he's selling Flat Earth oh yeah

2016.69 --> 2024.4
you could definitely say he is a shield

2019.58 --> 2027.73
for Flat Earth full-on in but that

2024.4 --> 2032.18
doesn't really mean anything other than

2027.73 --> 2035.72
that apparently Flat Earth is becoming a

2032.18 --> 2038.0600000000002
subject that relates to money somehow

2035.72 --> 2041.33
despite all the disclaimers from balls

2038.06 --> 2044.84
in the last year's spamming non cent Lee

2041.33 --> 2046.6699999999998
don't stop that it's all just oh it's

2044.84 --> 2050.41
just gonna destroy everything you're

2046.67 --> 2050.41
gonna get poor oh it's gonna be so bad

2051.94 --> 2061.16
so yeah what what is Mark sergeant

2056.5 --> 2065.53
shilling for it Flat Earth oh it's a

2061.16 --> 2073.5499999999997
parasite parasites make really really

2065.53 --> 2077.4500000000003
who how how is he Paris of what is he

2073.55 --> 2079.94
Paris iting on what group out there is

2077.45 --> 2083.1499999999996
being forced to finance him in is like

2079.94 --> 2085.4900000000002
oh my god please help us like we have

2083.15 --> 2086.6600000000003
this mark Sargent and we've been forced

2085.49 --> 2089.93
to pay him money

2086.66 --> 2098.5299999999997
we feel so abused it is like a parasite

2089.93 --> 2098.5299999999997
the what where please explain

2114.43 --> 2121.359
oh just like me

2118.029 --> 2128.14
while schminke schmick what kind of a

2121.359 --> 2132.5789999999997
name is that anyway let's see oh oh yeah

2128.14 --> 2134.98
you look just great you actually have a

2132.579 --> 2140.4100000000003
90 subscribers but you don't have any

2134.98 --> 2143.68
videos alright so yeah I don't know

2140.41 --> 2154.0789999999997
anything about you so I can't really say

2143.68 --> 2154.0789999999997
what you're doing but

2154.92 --> 2159.94
yeah unless you want to actually come

2158.08 --> 2162.61
with some arguments instead of just

2159.94 --> 2165.2200000000003
personally attacking people because of

2162.61 --> 2170.46
their financial circumstances and how

2165.22 --> 2170.4599999999996
they have to get by you know

2195.84 --> 2204.06
pass away tell you builded behind the

2199.41 --> 2206.25
curve documentary it's a stunt look mark

2204.06 --> 2208.92
sergeant and all of the people that went

2206.25 --> 2211.89
in there were very aware that they were

2208.92 --> 2214.02
being interviewed by somebody that by a

2211.89 --> 2216.5699999999997
group that was hostile towards Flat

2214.02 --> 2220.23
Earth nobody was having any real

2216.57 --> 2224.0
illusions about that although some kind

2220.23 --> 2227.31
of like open hope maybe naive wise but

2224.0 --> 2230.55
yeah all the people that were in there

2227.31 --> 2234.15
had a lot of material of them them

2230.55 --> 2238.3500000000004
talking saying things and yeah was all

2234.15 --> 2240.03
cut down and they just all put out there

2238.35 --> 2243.47
what they believed to be right and

2240.03 --> 2246.1200000000003
relevant so they all did their best and

2243.47 --> 2250.73
what was eventually taken from it was

2246.12 --> 2253.38
kind of a weird setup where they were

2250.73 --> 2255.63
where they really did their best to try

2253.38 --> 2259.07
to make them all look like fools but

2255.63 --> 2259.07
that was out of their hands

2261.98 --> 2268.08
so yeah the documentary itself is not

2265.65 --> 2272.51
genuine it is a highly politicized it's

2268.08 --> 2276.45
very manipulative but what flat earthers

2272.51 --> 2280.86
in that movie said yeah that was all

2276.45 --> 2283.62
genuine may not have all been absolutely

2280.86 --> 2284.48
correct at every corner but it was

2283.62 --> 2287.48
genuine

2284.48 --> 2287.48
absolutely

2302.84 --> 2313.4500000000003
hmm yeah yeah the makin I think you're

2307.55 --> 2320.8100000000004
right the mass is a conceptual

2313.45 --> 2326.0499999999997
derivative just like volume volume and

2320.81 --> 2335.54
the mass are conjoined derivatives of

2326.05 --> 2336.59
density of matter so one cannot exist

2335.54 --> 2340.43
without the other

2336.59 --> 2342.3500000000004
it's technically impossible unless you

2340.43 --> 2344.08
would have a theoretical absolute vacuum

2342.35 --> 2348.0499999999997
which is impossible to achieve

2344.08 --> 2350.06
physically so there's always the

2348.05 --> 2353.51
combination there's always volume and

2350.06 --> 2355.13
there's always mass of matter and which

2353.51 --> 2359.53
one you're gonna approach is how many

2355.13 --> 2359.53
you approach the concept of the density

2361.57 --> 2364.57
right

2369.349 --> 2375.8590000000004
no Carl stand back density is mass and

2372.709 --> 2378.009
volume not mass is not density in eval

2375.859 --> 2378.009
you

2407.98 --> 2410.7
hmm

2417.64 --> 2420.42
all right

2428.82 --> 2437.2200000000003
no no there is no mark sergeant's

2432.36 --> 2441.3
flattered society passivate oh the

2437.22 --> 2445.0499999999997
flatter society is not led by mark

2441.3 --> 2448.7400000000002
sergeant he did join it at one point out

2445.05 --> 2451.29
of curiosity and to inquire some

2448.74 --> 2455.2999999999997
information at the early days as he is

2451.29 --> 2458.73
admitted but it is not his stance and

2455.3 --> 2460.3500000000004
the Flat Earth Society presupposes a lot

2458.73 --> 2463.469
of silly things

2460.35 --> 2463.469
[Music]

2470.37 --> 2475.62
so yeah just don't call it mark

2472.89 --> 2479.8399999999997
sergeant's flattered society because

2475.62 --> 2479.8399999999997
that is a giant giant straw man

2507.75 --> 2518.48
yeah well Eric Dubay says a lot of crazy

2510.81 --> 2522.33
stuff you know Eric do base Flat Earth

2518.48 --> 2523.17
work I guess 200 proofs and all that

2522.33 --> 2529.65
it's pretty good

2523.17 --> 2532.17
as for his personal talk rumors and [ __ ]

2529.65 --> 2535.92
about other people it's just a complete

2532.17 --> 2538.23
waste of time so I wouldn't hold too

2535.92 --> 2541.4900000000002
much weight - Eric Dubay his opinions

2538.23 --> 2541.4900000000002
about other people in general

2553.75 --> 2560.17
right well pass away tow as I said Eric

2556.55 --> 2560.17
Dubay has said a lot of things

2565.349 --> 2568.13
yeah

2596.22 --> 2602.41
Wow somebody told you somebody was

2599.5 --> 2609.37
something move well if you'd go by

2602.41 --> 2612.0299999999997
general rumors but I don't know I don't

2609.37 --> 2612.0299999999997
think years

2616.98 --> 2623.25
but there has been some kind of covert

2619.91 --> 2625.23
suspicion going around on my side a

2623.25 --> 2627.599
little as well but I just don't really

2625.23 --> 2630.38
engage with it too much that he might

2627.599 --> 2634.02
have been caught in some kind of web

2630.38 --> 2637.56
situation with with maybe the CIA or

2634.02 --> 2643.859
something and that is also part of why

2637.56 --> 2645.71
he is over in the East so I do think

2643.859 --> 2650.0099999999998
there's a lot of suspicious stuffs

2645.71 --> 2655.619
concerning Eric Dubay but I just don't

2650.01 --> 2668.8390000000004
want to get into that you know it's just

2655.619 --> 2668.839
makes it more sivan you know maybe

2685.93 --> 2688.969
[Music]

2694.58 --> 2701.65
yeah I think I've seen them both mother

2697.01 --> 2701.65
Salim not a great fan

2728.01 --> 2730.67
why

2735.69 --> 2746.599
okay all right yeah it's silver I made

2739.53 --> 2746.599
it and this is pure silver as in 99.9%

2746.93 --> 2752.49
technically eat it not gonna chew it

2750.45 --> 2759.71
though and there's a Flower of Life

2752.49 --> 2759.7099999999996
pattern that I carved onto it so

2771.99 --> 2775.0499999999997
[Music]

2793.93 --> 2796.93
mmm

2798.03 --> 2801.84
oh yeah kamikaze Gilmore yeah I know

2800.64 --> 2806.5699999999997
everything about it

2801.84 --> 2806.57
haze I got that book

2813.96 --> 2832.41
I got the best book in the whole series

2818.51 --> 2836.63
Manuel of the plains and you're right he

2832.41 --> 2836.6299999999997
does have very interesting pictures

2838.25 --> 2844.559
conceptualize it yeah they really try

2840.569 --> 2848.099
out they try to give you some suggestion

2844.559 --> 2850.2000000000003
as to how to approach your own personal

2848.099 --> 2853.619
alternate difficult cosmogony

2850.2 --> 2855.839
what you can do they really explain this

2853.619 --> 2869.94
you're literally building your own

2855.839 --> 2872.13
cosmology you see and by the way no I

2869.94 --> 2874.319
haven't really read it basically just

2872.13 --> 2879.6800000000003
glanced through it because I already

2874.319 --> 2879.68
understood this before I have the book

2879.799 --> 2887.0099999999998
and actually remade some things about it

2884.16 --> 2890.46
like certain types of prestige classes

2887.01 --> 2893.5400000000004
like this one there in it I remade them

2890.46 --> 2893.54
to be a lot better

2894.97 --> 2898.0699999999997
[Applause]

2900.42 --> 2903.579
[Applause]

2906.69 --> 2922.5
there are some good pictures in you

2909.839 --> 2926.619
flying them they do try to avoid like a

2922.5 --> 2931.53
flat around the type view most of the

2926.619 --> 2938.38
time though there are pictures like this

2931.53 --> 2940.4500000000003
like ice guard but these are the special

2938.38 --> 2942.19
planes so that what they literally show

2940.45 --> 2949.5099999999998
you here is what it's supposed to be

2942.19 --> 2956.17
looking like it's not really the

2949.51 --> 2968.369
planetary if you know what I mean yeah

2956.17 --> 2970.5
limbo so chaos pandemonium the abyss

2968.369 --> 2973.7200000000003
isn't that interesting

2970.5 --> 2977.97
this is how they say the realm of the

2973.72 --> 2977.97
abyss works isn't that fascinating

2983.099 --> 3000.1400000000003
oh and there's Hades now they're not

2995.699 --> 3006.079
skipping anything it's all there where

3000.14 --> 3010.549
you got Hades looks pretty familiar

3006.079 --> 3016.9100000000003
right there's not a lot of planets in

3010.549 --> 3019.4
here as in zero although they leave it

3016.91 --> 3023.089
up to you to the to the gamemaster to

3019.4 --> 3027.529
decide whether the the earthly realms

3023.089 --> 3029.299
the material realm is a planet or not

3027.529 --> 3032.829
they leave that completely open oh yeah

3029.299 --> 3032.829
here we have the nine hells

3044.059 --> 3064.579
oh are you gonna live love this one

3058.759 --> 3071.779
Wow ah yeah that's just special oh this

3064.579 --> 3073.759
oh this is actually a special no way it

3071.779 --> 3077.199
is the Arcadia this place is called

3073.759 --> 3080.589
Arcadia yes

3077.199 --> 3080.589
check this out

3086.349 --> 3094.829
notice something over there that's just

3093.969 --> 3104.169
amazing

3094.829 --> 3109.199
it's like orb of day and night so they

3104.169 --> 3109.199
have a special separate Sun mechanic oh

3112.019 --> 3120.359
and here we have the mountain of

3114.249 --> 3128.799
Celestia it's very obviously inspired on

3120.359 --> 3130.8089999999997
on Mount Olympus and that's technically

3128.799 --> 3132.939
what it represents as well so let's just

3130.809 --> 3138.2490000000003
the realm of the Angels the lawful good

3132.939 --> 3142.39
and primary seat of one of the more of

3138.249 --> 3147.6989999999996
the more important gods because this

3142.39 --> 3150.069
book is realm is basically well it's

3147.699 --> 3151.4790000000003
fully in the grip of the sons of God you

3150.069 --> 3154.689
could call it because there's no

3151.479 --> 3157.3289999999997
singular deity except for a Oh who keeps

3154.689 --> 3159.3999999999996
out of everything so yeah one could

3157.329 --> 3161.679
speculate that that is supposedly the

3159.4 --> 3166.329
creator it's it's interesting what they

3161.679 --> 3170.14
made of it but this is in this realm in

3166.329 --> 3173.679
this world in this game it's it's pretty

3170.14 --> 3176.319
much a pre-flood setup with the gods

3173.679 --> 3181.079
involving themselves and magical powers

3176.319 --> 3181.079
going all the way overkill and all that

3181.469 --> 3190.679
Wow here we have Elysium and that's

3188.14 --> 3190.679
special

3198.48 --> 3213.2400000000002
hey it's hanging right over eight

3201.51 --> 3215.5200000000004
endless ocean fascinating let's see if

3213.24 --> 3217.95
it can find something else oh yeah this

3215.52 --> 3221.16
is probably the one that you were

3217.95 --> 3223.98
remembering it's Outlands it's there's

3221.16 --> 3226.67
been games specifically made about this

3223.98 --> 3229.77
region the term and Planescape

3226.67 --> 3234.48
specifically so this picture may seem

3229.77 --> 3237.42
very familiar to you there you go this

3234.48 --> 3239.4900000000002
is supposed to be the absolute epicenter

3237.42 --> 3243.359
of the outer Plains where everything

3239.49 --> 3247.16
crossroads with the tower and on this

3243.359 --> 3256.34
tower supposedly seats the god of magic

3247.16 --> 3256.3399999999997
book oh yeah fascinating isn't it

3258.81 --> 3261.9
[Music]

3266.14 --> 3274.64
Neph yeah there's a creature it's like a

3271.15 --> 3277.07
plane that is alive called Neth I

3274.64 --> 3283.8199999999997
actually worked with that in my own game

3277.07 --> 3288.25
I nest the plane that lives the realm of

3283.82 --> 3290.9
sentient matter it lives yeah it's weird

3288.25 --> 3292.0
but I involved the gamers with that as

3290.9 --> 3296.39
well

3292.0 --> 3300.65
whoa Thank You Ellie B for the super

3296.39 --> 3304.7599999999998
chat donation that's pretty big anyway

3300.65 --> 3311.0
yeah that's the menu of the planes great

3304.76 --> 3318.349
great I feel very lucky to have been

3311.0 --> 3320.38
able to acquire it and yeah why not show

3318.349 --> 3320.38
it

3334.4 --> 3340.6800000000003
all right there was no message in it no

3337.38 --> 3342.59
I didn't see that well if you just say

3340.68 --> 3347.2999999999997
what you wanted to say I'll shout it out

3342.59 --> 3347.3
anyway Thank You Ally before the hundred

3348.17 --> 3359.79
hundred danish crowns superjet the

3354.36 --> 3363.7400000000002
relation Brenda

3359.79 --> 3363.74
piss off with your straw man [ __ ]

3364.43 --> 3375.44
delusional [ __ ] it's like there's just

3371.13 --> 3378.84
no more viable ground with you Brenda

3375.44 --> 3381.51
every time I see you anywhere the only

3378.84 --> 3384.6600000000003
thing you do is make things shittier you

3381.51 --> 3388.7000000000003
don't you're not even capable of having

3384.66 --> 3388.7
a normal conversation anymore these days

3397.49 --> 3415.0499999999997
yeah whatever this is language yeah well

3411.63 --> 3432.81
when I use swear words I use Aliki pit

3415.05 --> 3438.11
short yeah yes disease a CTD let's say

3432.81 --> 3438.11
chat transmissible disease

3444.32 --> 3451.07
hmm hey thank you again le B there is no

3449.15 --> 3453.6800000000003
force that makes things fall it is

3451.07 --> 3457.6400000000003
merely a property of the realm we live

3453.68 --> 3464.0
in oh and the double spli experiment

3457.64 --> 3466.1299999999997
proves jack okay la vie thank you for

3464.0 --> 3468.41
that although I disagree with you

3466.13 --> 3471.53
because there is definitely a force you

3468.41 --> 3475.31
know where the force is it it arrives

3471.53 --> 3477.32
when matter when relative density is in

3475.31 --> 3482.0299999999997
at this equilibrium that's when the

3477.32 --> 3485.0
force arrives it is inherent within the

3482.03 --> 3487.67
relations between the material dance the

3485.0 --> 3495.47
densities of the materials that is what

3487.67 --> 3498.44
creates the force of displacement so

3495.47 --> 3501.7099999999996
forces definitely do make things fall

3498.44 --> 3503.78
and go up and displace in all kinds of

3501.71 --> 3507.2
way but that force is not a constant

3503.78 --> 3510.7000000000003
acceleration being applied to all things

3507.2 --> 3515.1499999999996
in a uniform way no it simply is

3510.7 --> 3517.7599999999998
inherent within matter when the density

3515.15 --> 3521.6
of a piece of matter is in this

3517.76 --> 3525.86
equilibrium with its surrounding that is

3521.6 --> 3527.99
when the force arrives you can call it

3525.86 --> 3529.9100000000003
gravity but it isn't gravity because

3527.99 --> 3532.9399999999996
gravity is supposed to be something else

3529.91 --> 3534.8599999999997
from all as all different angles it's

3532.94 --> 3537.59
either supposed to be some force this

3534.86 --> 3539.51
equilibrium constantly present or it's

3537.59 --> 3542.8700000000003
supposed to be the bending of space-time

3539.51 --> 3545.38
that which preceded it and doesn't even

3542.87 --> 3546.85
explain what it's supposed to be doing

3545.38 --> 3551.9
okay

3546.85 --> 3554.56
so gravity is nonsense relative density

3551.9 --> 3554.56
is proven

3565.369 --> 3575.6600000000003
ah okay ellaby yes sorry not gonna give

3573.589 --> 3577.46
you your super chats back but I really

3575.66 --> 3579.979
do appreciate you spreading around the

3577.46 --> 3582.65
wealth glad you're doing good that you

3579.979 --> 3585.46
feel that you can do that and thank you

3582.65 --> 3585.46
for sharing it with me

3592.69 --> 3599.7200000000003
if you have some more to spread around

3594.98 --> 3602.21
not saying you should but for me the

3599.72 --> 3605.5099999999998
paypal really works the best just to

3602.21 --> 3607.039
remind you if if you like it but yeah

3605.51 --> 3617.9300000000003
thank you for everything you've

3607.039 --> 3621.67
supported so far what YouTube should set

3617.93 --> 3621.6699999999996
up a trouble super chat

3625.08 --> 3628.139
[Music]

3630.28 --> 3636.25
yeah well you know if YouTube really

3633.7 --> 3640.5699999999997
wanted to screw their system over they

3636.25 --> 3643.06
could turn the chats into a buy to play

3640.57 --> 3646.5
type of system where you could literally

3643.06 --> 3648.43
buy privileges from me from YouTube

3646.5 --> 3650.89
maybe they're already doing that

3648.43 --> 3653.8599999999997
covertly they could do that but it would

3650.89 --> 3655.7799999999997
absolutely screw up the whole thing give

3653.86 --> 3657.94
them probably some money on the short

3655.78 --> 3662.71
run it would give the trolls a lot more

3657.94 --> 3666.25
grip and then eventually it'll just make

3662.71 --> 3668.98
everything squeeze the death quicker in

3666.25 --> 3672.31
the end so youtube if you're hearing

3668.98 --> 3674.94
this suggestion don't do that just leave

3672.31 --> 3680.7999999999997
things be retract your political

3674.94 --> 3684.64
meddling with everyone let this place be

3680.8 --> 3687.6600000000003
as free market as you can get calls to

3684.64 --> 3692.23
violence and all that out of the way and

3687.66 --> 3695.29
leave it to that and don't don't

3692.23 --> 3696.94
manipulate the meaning or context of

3695.29 --> 3702.5099999999998
things in order to get your political

3696.94 --> 3702.51
agenda in please YouTube

3709.569 --> 3714.73
only Shiva can see I'm pretty sure that

3712.309 --> 3720.8900000000003
Brenda said shared that she was

3714.73 --> 3723.2
originally a man and you can do with

3720.89 --> 3727.52
that whatever you want you know the

3723.2 --> 3730.73
thing is with me I really care so little

3727.52 --> 3733.13
that I will call her and she I have I

3730.73 --> 3735.619
have no issue with this I I have other

3733.13 --> 3740.63
Fred to all their transsexual friends

3735.619 --> 3743.119
yes I am so liberal yeah but I really

3740.63 --> 3745.1600000000003
don't mind as long as you just don't try

3743.119 --> 3747.53
to force it the bundle of children then

3745.16 --> 3749.8689999999997
I'm all fine with it it's a mistake I

3747.53 --> 3754.25
consider it a mistake but it's not an

3749.869 --> 3756.23
unforgivable mistake and the penalties

3754.25 --> 3758.9
for the mistake come within your own

3756.23 --> 3761.299
lifetime and everybody will face them

3758.9 --> 3769.73
sooner or later so that's just how it

3761.299 --> 3771.77
works to me and when I say okay I'm

3769.73 --> 3774.38
gonna accept that this person wants to

3771.77 --> 3777.53
be called a she then I will do it not

3774.38 --> 3780.9500000000003
because I believe it is a she but

3777.53 --> 3783.44
because that person has like an well to

3780.95 --> 3786.2
me I literally considered as a social

3783.44 --> 3788.41
abnormality or they would rather have

3786.2 --> 3790.16
everyone presupposed they'd be is she

3788.41 --> 3792.98
that's how I see it

3790.16 --> 3796.0099999999998
and I'm fine with that as long as they

3792.98 --> 3798.14
don't start to like attack me over it

3796.01 --> 3801.4300000000003
when I don't get when I'm not fanatical

3798.14 --> 3805.25
about it or enough or something you know

3801.43 --> 3807.859
don't push that [ __ ] on me but I have to

3805.25 --> 3810.89
not no big problem with it although I am

3807.859 --> 3813.2
not typically comfortable in a in a

3810.89 --> 3816.859
joint group of transsexuals or something

3813.2 --> 3818.45
know that I don't know that I wouldn't

3816.859 --> 3821.44
have be too comfortable with such a

3818.45 --> 3826.3689999999997
situation but that doesn't mean that I

3821.44 --> 3828.559
can't socially interact with these type

3826.369 --> 3830.78
of people I well I can't

3828.559 --> 3833.48
if they behave like Brenda's been doing

3830.78 --> 3836.7400000000002
because that but that has nothing to do

3833.48 --> 3839.75
with yeah her sexual issues or whatever

3836.74 --> 3842.029
that's just the behavior that behavior I

3839.75 --> 3844.939
don't really care what you are

3842.029 --> 3847.039
you know although the context doesn't

3844.939 --> 3851.089
matter for the overall behavior as to

3847.039 --> 3853.3990000000003
the what drives it but I'm not gonna

3851.089 --> 3857.629
accept that me havior and I'm gonna

3853.399 --> 3860.419
point at it very harshly but it has

3857.629 --> 3865.609
nothing to do with whether she was

3860.419 --> 3867.459
originally a man I don't care it's not

3865.609 --> 3869.919
worth my time

3867.459 --> 3875.1189999999997
thirty more minutes

3869.919 --> 3876.949
sure went on I'm fine with that I'm it's

3875.119 --> 3880.9990000000003
a Sunday I have all the time in the

3876.949 --> 3883.099
world it's nice weather now four more

3880.999 --> 3884.4489999999996
hours is not gonna happen it's a little

3883.099 --> 3896.949
bit too much but thanks for the

3884.449 --> 3896.949
suggestion okay Ellie be sure

3904.039 --> 3909.15
yeah if and four more hours not gonna

3906.749 --> 3911.97
happen not without a break

3909.15 --> 3916.009
Oh Brenda you're gonna Skype message me

3911.97 --> 3920.339
no I'm not angry I'm just really

3916.009 --> 3929.299
repulsed by your instance red herring

3920.339 --> 3933.499
messages just by basically your blatant

3929.299 --> 3935.729
compulsion to constantly maximize

3933.499 --> 3938.1299999999997
psychological attack even with first

3935.729 --> 3941.6299999999997
interaction that is what I have a

3938.13 --> 3946.589
problem with and I'm not afraid of it

3941.63 --> 3954.4700000000003
I'm not angry but I do get impatient

3946.589 --> 3954.47
with that okay Brenda

3988.22 --> 3993.98
right that was funny yeah yeah this

3990.5 --> 3996.14
morning or afternoon I was in the coffee

3993.98 --> 3998.9
shop and as I said like there was a lot

3996.14 --> 4002.71
of people going around that went to the

3998.9 --> 4007.859
thunderdome event the hardcore Stadium

4002.71 --> 4010.66
music stuff and a group of people were

4007.859 --> 4013.359
like I think they were like from

4010.66 --> 4015.79
Manchester or slightly more on the

4013.359 --> 4019.0299999999997
Scottish border because they they they

4015.79 --> 4022.06
really had the just a special way of

4019.03 --> 4024.4
talking I can't emulate but I just

4022.06 --> 4027.5789999999997
recognized that like oh wow that sounds

4024.4 --> 4031.21
like some of the people on some of the

4027.579 --> 4035.9700000000003
baller panel so it was special I'm

4031.21 --> 4038.8
getting more feel for the local type of

4035.97 --> 4042.31
accent in England because of all the

4038.8 --> 4044.5600000000004
debates I didn't address them or

4042.31 --> 4047.589
anything like they would they seemed

4044.56 --> 4049.589
kind of sick so I wasn't if I'd asked

4047.589 --> 4052.69
them like hey you know what flat earth

4049.589 --> 4054.609
if I did that one of the guys would have

4052.69 --> 4056.98
probably just looked at me and then ran

4054.609 --> 4064.74
away throwing up cuz he really looked

4056.98 --> 4064.7400000000002
like he had a lot of trouble yeah

4066.45 --> 4071.6099999999997
[Music]

4083.05 --> 4093.34
yeah I know mother Salim right look like

4089.8 --> 4095.5
a few weeks ago Jose subtly just went

4093.34 --> 4097.299
full in hostile and started attacking me

4095.5 --> 4100.87
for no reason even though we've been

4097.299 --> 4104.23
pretty civil and like comrades as

4100.87 --> 4106.99
youtubers started attacking me like

4104.23 --> 4108.669999999999
pretty brutally and I first thought okay

4106.99 --> 4111.73
it's just one of his moods or something

4108.67 --> 4113.47
you know but he kept on to it so yeah

4111.73 --> 4116.169999999999
because of that a few days ago it's just

4113.47 --> 4119.56
like you know what I haven't really been

4116.17 --> 4121.06
over to Jose's I haven't heard any sign

4119.56 --> 4124.450000000001
that there's something interesting going

4121.06 --> 4127.569
on there or that he's improved so I'm

4124.45 --> 4130.65
just gonna say it as it is it's [ __ ] it

4127.569 --> 4134.200000000001
really is and didn't even matter whether

4130.65 --> 4137.41
whether that person that I kicked out of

4134.2 --> 4139.839
my chat was actually Jose or some sock

4137.41 --> 4143.5
account or a fake-out I thought it was

4139.839 --> 4145.93
just a fight to say it because Jose just

4143.5 --> 4150.69
started to suck and I think it's

4145.93 --> 4153.13
probably ever a unwanted an accidental

4150.69 --> 4155.169999999999
reflection of his life I think that his

4153.13 --> 4157.299
life probably went pretty messy all of a

4155.17 --> 4159.67
sudden not too long ago and he's been

4157.299 --> 4161.859
very closed off about it but I could

4159.67 --> 4165.96
just feel it and he has a lot of

4161.859 --> 4168.76
frustration and he's throwing it out and

4165.96 --> 4171.7
damaging things damaging his own in the

4168.76 --> 4175.42
integrity of his show the friendships

4171.7 --> 4177.76
the trust and it's stupid it's a waste

4175.42 --> 4180.299
what he's doing and I don't know how to

4177.76 --> 4180.299
stop him

4189.339 --> 4191.94
yeah

4193.47 --> 4197.79
I don't know sleeping warrior if you're

4195.99 --> 4201.51
saying that is the reason because of

4197.79 --> 4204.99
John Watson I feel I don't know what the

4201.51 --> 4209.1
reason is I just know that Jose is gone

4204.99 --> 4211.349999999999
bad he started to rot he's no longer

4209.1 --> 4219.900000000001
free and open he's just started to

4211.35 --> 4223.370000000001
become politically angry so he's he

4219.9 --> 4227.25
probably caught the the inevitable

4223.37 --> 4230.13
contagion like the the ctd that beretta

4227.25 --> 4232.17
has maybe he caught that and it's

4230.13 --> 4233.9400000000005
starting to eat its way through his soul

4232.17 --> 4238.65
and he's starting to turn into one of

4233.94 --> 4242.49
them a permanent red herring fish

4238.65 --> 4246.44
slapping contest salesman that that is

4242.49 --> 4246.44
what the ctd turns you into

4259.67 --> 4268.0
yeah yeah sleeping work you know what at

4264.17 --> 4272.6900000000005
this point I don't know why Jose even

4268.0 --> 4277.88
why he doesn't just straight out

4272.69 --> 4281.719999999999
straight out shamelessly as in screw all

4277.88 --> 4286.79
of you just opens up a YouTube baller

4281.72 --> 4293.54
Church why not you could do it could

4286.79 --> 4296.63
bring a little bit of the swing into it

4293.54 --> 4298.85
and just turn his show nothing to do

4296.63 --> 4301.97
but-- but just turn it into a freakin

4298.85 --> 4304.72
hallelujah baller Church dude do that

4301.97 --> 4309.1
Jose it work it's it's absolutely

4304.72 --> 4313.1900000000005
[ __ ] it's insane but it'll work

4309.1 --> 4316.490000000001
because yeah the degeneration of the the

4313.19 --> 4320.389999999999
baller crowds are ready to stoop to that

4316.49 --> 4323.63
level where it will actually start to

4320.39 --> 4325.55
fill in a need that they have even

4323.63 --> 4327.77
though they claim that it's not the case

4325.55 --> 4331.13
that it's all not true they will be

4327.77 --> 4336.8
ready to take those seats in those banks

4331.13 --> 4340.400000000001
and embrace the ball religiously in a

4336.8 --> 4345.5
ritualistic fashion so yeah go for it

4340.4 --> 4349.66
Jose make the baller Church everybody

4345.5 --> 4349.66
welcome as long as you respect the ball

4350.11 --> 4353.11
boom

4356.72 --> 4361.2390000000005
[Music]

4358.65 --> 4364.15
so there you go more free advice to a

4361.239 --> 4366.04
person that's for no reason turn into a

4364.15 --> 4375.129999999999
complete [ __ ] towards me and I'm just

4366.04 --> 4376.81
giving it away because I'm nice and if I

4375.13 --> 4379.5
have an interesting idea I can't help

4376.81 --> 4379.5
but share it

4383.34 --> 4387.939
[Music]

4393.349 --> 4396.07
hmm

4402.02 --> 4407.530000000001
yeah that's a good description Ali be

4404.06 --> 4407.530000000001
the pretty on target

4413.929 --> 4416.409
it's

4430.789 --> 4437.179
what that is the way to the future what

4435.079 --> 4442.539
you mean the baller Church you agree

4437.179 --> 4448.519
with that idea why not

4442.539 --> 4452.09
and I'm pretty sure that yeah if they

4448.519 --> 4453.679
want to do the prayer that Nathan's not

4452.09 --> 4457.360000000001
gonna copyright that so they could just

4453.679 --> 4460.369
do the narrator your spiritus Sanctus

4457.36 --> 4467.449
already as Dominus spiritus Sanctus

4460.369 --> 4471.308999999999
Arwen they can do that they don't have

4467.449 --> 4471.308999999999
to use our Whedon if they don't want to

4477.99 --> 4481.0289999999995
[Music]

4487.32 --> 4492.21
okay Philip Cooper well thank you I'm

4489.9 --> 4499.259999999999
pretty aware of that that's what I've

4492.21 --> 4502.83
been doing it's what I do it's the

4499.26 --> 4505.400000000001
reason I guess people still see future

4502.83 --> 4509.36
in me including myself

4505.4 --> 4509.36
that is my ideas

4518.73 --> 4530.339999999999
really where where m7 where what aspect

4525.29 --> 4538.94
you tell me where is my religious

4530.34 --> 4538.9400000000005
doctrine where is my ritualistic element

4539.15 --> 4561.389999999999
except for well the show the way I

4541.5 --> 4568.26
started in and rounded out okay I'm

4561.39 --> 4570.719
whatever I need to be but hey if you can

4568.26 --> 4571.4400000000005
point out the religious elements to my

4570.719 --> 4574.9800000000005
channel

4571.44 --> 4578.879999999999
mercury m7 please please share it with

4574.98 --> 4581.91
me I'd love to hear it I know you it's

4578.88 --> 4584.39
very very much down your lane of just

4581.91 --> 4586.5599999999995
immediately taking somebody else's

4584.39 --> 4589.83
explanation when it actually makes sense

4586.56 --> 4594.56
and and just take a part of it like copy

4589.83 --> 4597.63
paste and then just that's you this you

4594.56 --> 4600.42
it is such a sophisticated technique

4597.63 --> 4602.13
just copy paste what the person said put

4600.42 --> 4604.07
it out of context and dump it on

4602.13 --> 4606.1990000000005
somebody without actually understanding

4604.07 --> 4610.73
anything about what you're saying

4606.199 --> 4615.449
it's a classic baller classic mercury m7

4610.73 --> 4619.259999999999
so maybe you could now actually explain

4615.449 --> 4621.87
to me what elements of my channel are

4619.26 --> 4625.7300000000005
religious in order to back up your very

4621.87 --> 4632.699
sloppy clumsily ill-thought-out

4625.73 --> 4634.709999999999
accusation mercury m7 okay if you'd have

4632.699 --> 4641.46
some backup maybe I'm not gonna ban you

4634.71 --> 4645.02
you know leave it up to you it's not

4641.46 --> 4645.02
like I'm not giving you a chance

4666.9 --> 4669.799999999999
waiting

4674.719 --> 4681.19
what concerning my channel is religious

4687.4 --> 4695.679999999999
is oh my god oh so you're not gonna

4692.56 --> 4697.870000000001
point at what is religious about my

4695.68 --> 4700.06
channel instead you're gonna try to

4697.87 --> 4704.07
claim that I don't understand the word

4700.06 --> 4713.200000000001
religion for having used it how classic

4704.07 --> 4715.179999999999
how classic so do you know what it is or

4713.2 --> 4718.96
are you just gonna go with this oh yeah

4715.18 --> 4721.54
I'm being forced to use a word so I'm

4718.96 --> 4724.24
gonna claim that the one asking me to

4721.54 --> 4725.8
prove it I know something about it claim

4724.24 --> 4728.5
that he doesn't know he doesn't know you

4725.8 --> 4731.01
explained it you put out the book you do

4728.5 --> 4735.49
all the work because I'm a freakin lazy

4731.01 --> 4738.280000000001
[ __ ] that copy pastes things other

4735.49 --> 4740.53
people say and try to smack them with it

4738.28 --> 4741.969999999999
without actually understanding what the

4740.53 --> 4745.95
hell they're talking about

4741.97 --> 4749.13
because they are freakin retards and

4745.95 --> 4752.82
lazy as [ __ ]

4749.13 --> 4752.82
mercury m7

4769.82 --> 4778.15
yeah laugh it up so funny it's so funny

4774.71 --> 4780.89
when you're being absolutely barebone

4778.15 --> 4785.15
humiliated for what you've done and how

4780.89 --> 4789.8
lame it is and that you can't just

4785.15 --> 4793.82
nobody of you nobody ever just answers a

4789.8 --> 4797.45
question never if there's any kind of

4793.82 --> 4800.69
creativity involved in actually figuring

4797.45 --> 4802.79
out something real as soon as anyone in

4800.69 --> 4806.86
the freaking world any flat earth or

4802.79 --> 4812.14
anyone asks you something you never

4806.86 --> 4816.5
answer because you're systemic retards

4812.14 --> 4819.38
systemic like but sometimes I think that

4816.5 --> 4821.81
potentially you could be smart if you

4819.38 --> 4825.38
didn't have this mechanism inside your

4821.81 --> 4829.09
brain literally killing off your own

4825.38 --> 4832.79
intelligence literally doing that to you

4829.09 --> 4835.610000000001
it's a brain self-destruct mechanism

4832.79 --> 4838.09
that just disables you from

4835.61 --> 4841.37
understanding things and it erases

4838.09 --> 4845.38
information coming to you as it is

4841.37 --> 4845.38
coming to you it is so sad

4851.83 --> 4854.88
[Music]

religious go because you still haven't

4906.19 --> 4915.58
answered that where qm7

4910.36 --> 4918.429999999999
I know it's so funny it's so funny I am

4915.58 --> 4922.18
so winning because I'm not answering any

4918.43 --> 4924.64
questions and therefore not giving the

4922.18 --> 4927.4890000000005
crowd the people out there proof that I

4924.64 --> 4931.12
know anything that I'm anything other

4927.489 --> 4935.5599999999995
than an absolute [ __ ] and a piece of

4931.12 --> 4944.92
[ __ ] elmer qm7

4935.56 --> 4947.02
and so funny so go I'm giving you three

4944.92 --> 4950.08
more minutes if you don't give me any

4947.02 --> 4953.56
kind of argument whether it be broken or

4950.08 --> 4956.0199999999995
not but just any argument somehow

4953.56 --> 4960.900000000001
pointing at how my channel and my

4956.02 --> 4965.64
activities are religious I'm banning you

4960.9 --> 4968.5599999999995
so go ahead I'll give you a fair shot

4965.64 --> 4970.39
like why don't you just take a shot why

4968.56 --> 4973.9890000000005
don't you actually try to answer a

4970.39 --> 4978.1
freaking question you're [ __ ] instead

4973.989 --> 4980.379999999999
of just sitting there so funny how I'm

4978.1 --> 4991.92
not answering the question it makes me

4980.38 --> 4991.92
look so smart got two minutes

4996.809 --> 5007.51
what about my channel and my activities

5000.429 --> 5007.51
is religious mercury m7 like you claim

5020.17 --> 5027.0
I know he's got nothing but even if you

5023.53 --> 5032.889999999999
got nothing you can still try something

5027.0 --> 5040.27
you know you know that conceding to the

5032.89 --> 5042.64
truth is a win it is even if you got

5040.27 --> 5045.280000000001
nothing if you at least concede to the

5042.64 --> 5047.71
obvious truth then you have a win it's

5045.28 --> 5050.74
just that these people people have been

5047.71 --> 5054.1
so poisoned so politicized beyond

5050.74 --> 5056.8
anything that being rights in their

5054.1 --> 5061.0
political belief is more important than

5056.8 --> 5064.03
the truth systematically systematically

5061.0 --> 5066.1
it completely bypasses there of their

5064.03 --> 5069.3
own normal function as a human being

5066.1 --> 5071.7300000000005
it's just that yeah the belief is more

5069.3 --> 5079.99
important than the truth

5071.73 --> 5083.429999999999
that's very distinct palpable element to

5079.99 --> 5083.429999999999
the whole globe religion ah

5084.78 --> 5090.34
mercury m7 well you're not banned yet

5088.57 --> 5093.759999999999
you still got a minute

5090.34 --> 5095.650000000001
and you're done with me I'm so childish

5093.76 --> 5100.39
even though you haven't answered the

5095.65 --> 5103.75
question as to your statement that my

5100.39 --> 5106.21
channel was religious and I just asked

5103.75 --> 5108.07
you could you may name one thing about

5106.21 --> 5110.11
my channel or what I've done that is

5108.07 --> 5113.799999999999
religious and you're just not answering

5110.11 --> 5117.91
in no way so I said oh you're being bad

5113.8 --> 5120.25
you oh my god so sad

5117.91 --> 5122.68
you're not even trying you're literally

5120.25 --> 5127.81
just pre complaining about getting

5122.68 --> 5131.43
banned like you didn't get a chance it's

5127.81 --> 5136.42
now I'm not banning him yet I just I

5131.43 --> 5139.030000000001
just want to see if somehow just get

5136.42 --> 5143.59
this little little little spark of

5139.03 --> 5147.009999999999
humanity from within and it's like you

5143.59 --> 5149.68
know even pure charcoal has its function

5147.01 --> 5152.35
just put a spark in there and suddenly

5149.68 --> 5152.84
it can turn into heat and you can do

5152.35 --> 5157.660000000001
something

5152.84 --> 5163.63
with it you know so even somebody as did

5157.66 --> 5167.45
just did yeah so lowdown it's mercury m7

5163.63 --> 5170.03
even he could potentially actually

5167.45 --> 5180.7699999999995
answer in a question I believe it is

5170.03 --> 5183.41
possible hmm okay second message banned

5180.77 --> 5185.72
me Arwen banning is what childish people

5183.41 --> 5192.349999999999
do I can still read that and I think

5185.72 --> 5197.4800000000005
that most of people in chat cam so are

5192.35 --> 5199.58
you gonna answer as to what about what I

5197.48 --> 5201.83
do and this show and my channel is

5199.58 --> 5204.92
religious yet or are you just gonna keep

5201.83 --> 5208.63
on now spamming my chat how you are

5204.92 --> 5211.91
banned even though everybody can read it

5208.63 --> 5214.52
are you just gonna be an abject lunatic

5211.91 --> 5216.59
out in the street saying insane [ __ ]

5214.52 --> 5219.9400000000005
because that's practically what it comes

5216.59 --> 5219.9400000000005
down to what you're doing right now

5227.55 --> 5233.820000000001
you know you still have the chance to

5230.1 --> 5235.9800000000005
actually respond to a question I I still

5233.82 --> 5238.38
have the belief that it is physically

5235.98 --> 5241.259999999999
possible for you to answer a question

5238.38 --> 5244.38
that is asked to you I think it is

5241.26 --> 5247.71
possible and still giving you yeah I'm

5244.38 --> 5248.31
giving you extra minutes just do it next

5247.71 --> 5254.34
message

5248.31 --> 5259.76
just just answer a question for once in

5254.34 --> 5259.76
your depravity gutter dwelling life

5280.31 --> 5283.21
he left

5286.68 --> 5295.02
it's amazing isn't it see it does work

5290.82 --> 5297.57
it really does work if you just zoom in

5295.02 --> 5302.64
on a single individual and don't let go

5297.57 --> 5304.86
and press the real issue not just the

5302.64 --> 5306.660000000001
one real issue at the core not all the

5304.86 --> 5309.2699999999995
[ __ ] that surrounds it in history

5306.66 --> 5313.11
because that is just too much you just

5309.27 --> 5316.02
press the issue in the moment and you

5313.11 --> 5320.13
keep on pressing it because it is like a

5316.02 --> 5322.860000000001
nerve to them it is a nerve that breaks

5320.13 --> 5325.650000000001
apart that that system that they got in

5322.86 --> 5327.839999999999
place that allows them to not answer

5325.65 --> 5336.629999999999
things and keep claiming things that

5327.84 --> 5338.400000000001
make no sense oh look who's back not

5336.63 --> 5341.67
answering the question of course he's

5338.4 --> 5343.86
now claiming that I claim the ball as a

5341.67 --> 5350.63
religion and that I have to prove that

5343.86 --> 5350.63
it's a religion that's not that's doing

5351.41 --> 5358.44
it can't be serious man that doesn't

5356.04 --> 5361.89
answer the question why don't you tell

5358.44 --> 5364.889999999999
me what I do is religious why don't you

5361.89 --> 5367.77
point at it instead of that I have to

5364.89 --> 5371.780000000001
now go over again and again like I have

5367.77 --> 5375.6
for weeks now explaining in detail how

5371.78 --> 5377.91
the ball is a religion and why what why

5375.6 --> 5380.160000000001
it is at the core religion it is because

5377.91 --> 5384.2699999999995
it's broken it is a religion because

5380.16 --> 5387.0
it's a lie and it doesn't work every

5384.27 --> 5389.280000000001
part of it is broken even if you

5387.0 --> 5391.74
presuppose all of it it's still broken

5389.28 --> 5395.04
it doesn't work out how it's supposed to

5391.74 --> 5397.38
it's broken it's a lie and therefore

5395.04 --> 5401.03
everything that concerns it and

5397.38 --> 5403.56
everything that is for that lie is

5401.03 --> 5406.889999999999
religious because you got to be

5403.56 --> 5410.51
delusional to keep on forwarding a lie

5406.89 --> 5410.51
as if it were the truth

5410.69 --> 5414.379999999999
mercury m7

5422.179 --> 5429.53
yeah religion is lie it is fundamentally

5425.78 --> 5433.13
a lie it doesn't mean that beliefs are

5429.53 --> 5438.5599999999995
all wrong that there's no valuable thing

5433.13 --> 5440.83
in foreign religions in religion

5438.56 --> 5444.35
religious documents for example

5440.83 --> 5450.969
information or teachings just means that

5444.35 --> 5456.05
religion itself is a system that forces

5450.969 --> 5462.02
people to accept things without proof

5456.05 --> 5466.1
and that makes it well a lie could be a

5462.02 --> 5468.4400000000005
lie or it is a lie you don't really know

5466.1 --> 5472.120000000001
until you actually start to discover it

5468.44 --> 5480.08
if your if your religion allows you to

5472.12 --> 5483.349999999999
so it all depends really but yeah again

5480.08 --> 5487.37
it's kind of a straw man because in this

5483.35 --> 5489.71
case and religion is the religion of the

5487.37 --> 5494.0
globe is specifically about upholding

5489.71 --> 5496.85
the lie Wow for example Christianity is

5494.0 --> 5502.219
much more diverse and complex is

5496.85 --> 5505.85
surrounding data and information and and

5502.219 --> 5510.17
just wisdom within that revealing the

5505.85 --> 5513.71
true nature of reality and then what was

5510.17 --> 5518.3
built around it is just a society to

5513.71 --> 5520.219
take that and do things together with

5518.3 --> 5522.14
that material with that knowledge to try

5520.219 --> 5525.199
and integrate it culturally and socially

5522.14 --> 5529.4890000000005
and the power structures that eventually

5525.199 --> 5533.12
come with that and the lies and control

5529.489 --> 5535.07
and all that that inevitably comes from

5533.12 --> 5538.76
power structure and that is how religion

5535.07 --> 5544.07
eventually it's not right that doesn't

5538.76 --> 5546.38
mean that things within the religion

5544.07 --> 5550.0
that our users used as a doctrine are

5546.38 --> 5551.659000000001
all all of it 100 percent incorrect

5550.0 --> 5555.11
information like the biblical

5551.659 --> 5558.21
information is just very important

5555.11 --> 5562.0199999999995
but that doesn't mean that you're gonna

5558.21 --> 5564.84
have to interpret it exactly as your

5562.02 --> 5567.450000000001
priests tell you how to because that

5564.84 --> 5571.34
then could turn it into a lie that would

5567.45 --> 5571.34
take away the insight in the growth

5582.569 --> 5588.809
all right well anyway the way I put it

5585.809 --> 5590.939
out religion it directly intertwined if

5588.809 --> 5593.609
it lies it's kind of a rough statement

5590.939 --> 5595.619000000001
it'll ruffle some feathers I know I had

5593.609 --> 5599.030000000001
to say it because in this specific

5595.619 --> 5604.018999999999
context in the context of the globe

5599.03 --> 5607.499
nothing is more applicable nothing is

5604.019 --> 5611.269
more applicable with the globe that the

5607.499 --> 5615.179
belief system the religion is there

5611.269 --> 5618.209
purely to uphold the lie the provable

5615.179 --> 5623.899
lie that is what is our religious about

5618.209 --> 5627.119
it but it's much more extreme than most

5623.899 --> 5630.479
other type of religion there they're not

5627.119 --> 5632.728999999999
that that extreme religious that would

5630.479 --> 5638.459
lean so heavily on cognitive dissonance

5632.729 --> 5641.549
as the globe does but then again yeah

5638.459 --> 5645.629
humans can literally just use any type

5641.549 --> 5649.26
of religions and turn and make some kind

5645.629 --> 5651.539
of tradition with it that that would

5649.26 --> 5653.729
completely conflict with the bottom line

5651.539 --> 5655.259999999999
approach of the religious or of the

5653.729 --> 5658.519
doctrines in the first place that's

5655.26 --> 5662.339
always the thing about it you see

5658.519 --> 5664.349
anything can be used to just make

5662.339 --> 5666.839
something with it that eventually turns

5664.349 --> 5668.539
out as the exact opposite of the

5666.839 --> 5671.459
foundation of it

5668.539 --> 5673.349
and in a way you could if you look

5671.459 --> 5675.479
carefully you'd see that the globe in a

5673.349 --> 5677.419
way could be approached that way too

5675.479 --> 5679.530000000001
because it is founded on the

5677.419 --> 5684.269
conceptualization of presuppositional

5679.53 --> 5687.179
honesty but then when yeah eventually

5684.269 --> 5692.399
proof against it pops up it is discarded

5687.179 --> 5694.849
is put aside it is bypassed so it's not

5692.399 --> 5698.609
really presupposition anymore the lies

5694.849 --> 5700.979
the presuppositions have been caught up

5698.609 --> 5703.439
with with real facts and they just

5700.979 --> 5706.369000000001
refused to let the facts replace the

5703.439 --> 5706.369000000001
presuppositions

5710.51 --> 5717.360000000001
and those are the lies in place that

5713.78 --> 5720.15
yeah force everyone to just uphold these

5717.36 --> 5722.69
beliefs even though the proof contrasts

5720.15 --> 5722.69
it

5746.77 --> 5751.660000000001
yeah yeah murk himself I'm just gonna

5749.2 --> 5758.92
piss off because he never answered to my

5751.66 --> 5764.23
question and I think that 10 extra

5758.92 --> 5767.32
minutes was enough it's so funny because

5764.23 --> 5772.15
it's all there it's all visible in there

5767.32 --> 5772.799999999999
I know he's no longer there doesn't

5772.15 --> 5776.629
matter

5812.69 --> 5820.86
ha well the studio 68 is a good good way

5818.85 --> 5824.55
to approach it Christianity is strictly

5820.86 --> 5826.679999999999
not a religion do be on faith and doing

5824.55 --> 5832.05
the commandments Christians are free to

5826.68 --> 5835.320000000001
think well that is debatable that is one

5832.05 --> 5837.35
way that's a very good way to approach

5835.32 --> 5840.9
it I agree with that

5837.35 --> 5842.76
unfortunately there is also a lot of

5840.9 --> 5846.0599999999995
Christians that don't feel like that

5842.76 --> 5849.150000000001
that belief you need to be much more

5846.06 --> 5852.09
rigid in a very specific way in order to

5849.15 --> 5855.45
be a proper Christian but yeah that

5852.09 --> 5858.18
again that's like a culturalization it's

5855.45 --> 5860.49
the human's interpretation enforcing

5858.18 --> 5864.38
that and that's wrong so technically I

5860.49 --> 5864.38
completely agree with that statement

5869.15 --> 5873.5599999999995
mmm right yeah mother Salim yeah thank

5872.78 --> 5876.7699999999995
you

5873.56 --> 5880.34
concerning the p900 I had for a moment

5876.77 --> 5883.580000000001
yesterday I thought like cuz this the

5880.34 --> 5885.71
night sky was extremely clear and I

5883.58 --> 5887.3
could see the Stars I even recognized

5885.71 --> 5890.36
constellations and everything I thought

5887.3 --> 5895.18
like could I film this but if the wind

5890.36 --> 5895.179999999999
was also blowing quite hard so I I

5895.24 --> 5903.83
didn't feel like risking it but maybe

5901.46 --> 5905.6
maybe this night will be very clear

5903.83 --> 5909.11
night again and I might try I'm very

5905.6 --> 5912.160000000001
curious to see what I can get out of the

5909.11 --> 5916.549999999999
p900 just see sooo mning in on stars

5912.16 --> 5919.37
especially hope to see like planets for

5916.55 --> 5921.38
example Venus in the morning I really

5919.37 --> 5923.24
wanna zoom in on Venus in the morning

5921.38 --> 5924.5
because that even with my eye seeing it

5923.24 --> 5927.28
with my eyes has always been very

5924.5 --> 5927.28
special to me

5934.5 --> 5943.86
all right AGM totally agree it's the

5937.26 --> 5946.35
path the method the frequency it is what

5943.86 --> 5950.5199999999995
works best according to the design of

5946.35 --> 5953.1
creation that is what I think it is so

5950.52 --> 5959.120000000001
it is more Christianity to me is more

5953.1 --> 5959.120000000001
like a method a method of honesty and

5960.5 --> 5968.82
yeah that's almost it honesty and good

5965.61 --> 5976.62
spirit as much as possible creativity

5968.82 --> 5980.099999999999
but also especially just yeah the the

5976.62 --> 5986.03
basics of our nature as well what it is

5980.1 --> 5989.370000000001
to be human to to eat grow learn and

5986.03 --> 5992.28
eventually socially entwined with the

5989.37 --> 5996.5599999999995
other sex and have children and all that

5992.28 --> 6000.349999999999
and I still stand behind that i yeah

5996.56 --> 6003.860000000001
that's also part of it like the book

6000.35 --> 6006.47
shows you where the fruits are I I

6003.86 --> 6008.87
consider much of just the book is almost

6006.47 --> 6010.79
like a trial-and-error manual it just

6008.87 --> 6012.62
shows you with everything what what

6010.79 --> 6015.7699999999995
happens what's the consequence what

6012.62 --> 6020.3
happens what's the consequences and it's

6015.77 --> 6021.68
not always that straightforward but that

6020.3 --> 6024.05
doesn't mean it doesn't make any sense

6021.68 --> 6026.950000000001
it just means you have to look deeper

6024.05 --> 6026.95
for the context

6038.87 --> 6043.94
thank you

6040.38 --> 6047.1
Thank You Brenda for another interesting

6043.94 --> 6049.759999999999
interesting remark we got another

6047.1 --> 6053.1
fictional statement from Brenda

6049.76 --> 6058.79
space-time is not conceptual it is real

6053.1 --> 6058.79
and physical congratulations Brenda

6060.8 --> 6063.8
congratulations

[Music]

6100.639 --> 6103.88
thank you

6125.43 --> 6130.51
well if you got a new ridiculous story

6128.38 --> 6134.05
as to how to space-time is supposed to

6130.51 --> 6137.38
be actual physical and you actually got

6134.05 --> 6140.17
my curiosity now but it's kind of late

6137.38 --> 6143.59
to get you in on this right now but I I

6140.17 --> 6146.1900000000005
may be open to hear you out about that

6143.59 --> 6146.1900000000005
at some time

6152.5 --> 6171.58
this is what what Gordon F I'm the

6160.48 --> 6174.61
George Clooney of and I don't know how

6171.58 --> 6176.85
to feel about that state but that's just

6174.61 --> 6176.849999999999
weird

6201.49 --> 6207.37
yeah and there's a is another musing

6204.81 --> 6211.990000000001
you're not smart for saying something

6207.37 --> 6213.5199999999995
like that anyway yeah I'm not gonna get

6211.99 --> 6215.7699999999995
Brendon because I'm actually kind of

6213.52 --> 6218.38
hungry and I don't feel like sitting

6215.77 --> 6221.47
through a half hour of Brenda while I'm

6218.38 --> 6224.02
being hungry and all that sorry all that

6221.47 --> 6232.87
excuse whatever but it's just too late

6224.02 --> 6234.67
for that [ __ ] for me but hey okay Brenda

6232.87 --> 6237.5199999999995
if you want tomorrow

6234.67 --> 6240.64
and please please don't show up in the

6237.52 --> 6241.030000000001
last five minutes okay if you just come

6240.64 --> 6244.990000000001
on

6241.03 --> 6248.71
sure I'll I'd love to hear your bizarro

6244.99 --> 6251.41
story as to how the bending of

6248.71 --> 6256.15
space-time is physically real it love to

6251.41 --> 6259.0599999999995
hear whatever boil up in in there and

6256.15 --> 6260.62
the weird fantasy of yours but yeah

6259.06 --> 6264.25
right now it's a little bit too late so

6260.62 --> 6266.8
yeah you can have another 20 hours of

6264.25 --> 6270.57
thinking about it before you put it down

6266.8 --> 6270.570000000001
on the record

6273.969 --> 6281.26
hmm oh yeah thank you danke I try to be

6279.28 --> 6283.84
here every single day I am here and

6281.26 --> 6285.58
unless I really can't or if there's some

6283.84 --> 6289.51
kind of appointment somewhere else so I

6285.58 --> 6291.07
can make it what yeah if I don't have

6289.51 --> 6294.43
something important to do I will

6291.07 --> 6296.23
definitely do the show and yeah I don't

6294.43 --> 6299.1990000000005
have that many important things to do

6296.23 --> 6305.049999999999
currently so I tend to have the show

6299.199 --> 6308.259999999999
every single day that of course would

6305.05 --> 6311.53
absolutely change if I'd ever had a main

6308.26 --> 6313.51
line job of some kind and that's why

6311.53 --> 6317.199
I've been asking for so much support

6313.51 --> 6319.39
from people and allowing myself to

6317.199 --> 6323.349999999999
continually do it because it is really

6319.39 --> 6330.400000000001
necessary it's I really do need the

6323.35 --> 6332.650000000001
support because otherwise it just can't

6330.4 --> 6335.53
keep this up but so far it's been great

6332.65 --> 6339.73
especially Friday the huge wave of

6335.53 --> 6342.25
support with right before Flat Earth

6339.73 --> 6343.8099999999995
debate number 1,000 and thank you so

6342.25 --> 6349.0
everyone that had been supporting me

6343.81 --> 6352.9800000000005
back then and yeah that it does help I'm

6349.0 --> 6357.55
now all set because as I said before I

6352.98 --> 6360.3099999999995
have had to pay back the Google loan

6357.55 --> 6363.46
that I practically got in the summer so

6360.31 --> 6368.469
I'm still still in the red but it helped

6363.46 --> 6370.75
a lot it brought a lot closer to getting

6368.469 --> 6373.9890000000005
out of the red but I still do need some

6370.75 --> 6377.53
support over here and there and yeah the

6373.989 --> 6379.87
PayPal would be the best way or the the

6377.53 --> 6383.3099999999995
patreon as well because yeah my patron

6379.87 --> 6386.349999999999
has been upgraded little Julie Bennett

6383.31 --> 6389.26
has been substantially upgrading it so I

6386.35 --> 6393.13
think I got got like 25 euros out of it

6389.26 --> 6395.14
a month I haven't seen it being

6393.13 --> 6398.08
transferred yet though so there may be

6395.14 --> 6400.09
something blocking my patreon from

6398.08 --> 6402.969
paying out I don't know yet

6400.09 --> 6405.13
to figure it out but please do keep

6402.969 --> 6407.56
supporting me I know it's annoying every

6405.13 --> 6413.74
time I ask it I think it's annoying

6407.56 --> 6415.51
I do need it so and yeah everyone that

6413.74 --> 6418.51
has supported me thank you for doing it

6415.51 --> 6420.49
I know not everybody that likes to

6418.51 --> 6423.25

solving the camera maybe who knows I'm

6488.28 --> 6492.73

6491.05 --> 6494.2
possibilities with this beautiful clear

6492.73 --> 6498.61
weather look look at this

6494.2 --> 6501.19
see that's it's like despite the

6498.61 --> 6505.0599999999995
chemtrails there's still these huge

6501.19 --> 6508.66
clear blue patches it's almost like the

6505.06 --> 6511.96
sky somehow is just clearing itself up

6508.66 --> 6515.05
extra heavily I can't understand how

6511.96 --> 6517.0
it's working but it is the type of

6515.05 --> 6520.42
weather that will be this night I might

6517.0 --> 6524.26
do a night owl number 3 finally finally

6652.06 --> 6656.02
around here for a moment I don't know

6653.17 --> 6661.35
why I'm just gonna break off the show

6656.02 --> 6661.35
whenever I feel like it yeah

6662.04 --> 6671.32
boo I'm still here and hey I'm still not

6665.98 --> 6674.08
seeing where are my up votes 15 really

6671.32 --> 6679.99
15 people is all that like this show

6674.08 --> 6681.73
with I just just with all the activity

6679.99 --> 6685.63
and chat I can barely believe that

6681.73 --> 6689.009999999999
that's really the result but yeah I know

6685.63 --> 6689.01
most of you try

6693.45 --> 6699.9
[Music]

6695.49 --> 6706.0289999999995
look George

6699.9 --> 6706.0289999999995
[Music]

6740.6 --> 6748.31
so funny it's like the default thing

6746.03 --> 6750.11
that he always does and like by the way

6748.31 --> 6752.6
all the crows do it is they just

6750.11 --> 6758.299999999999
overturn rocks to see if something is

6752.6 --> 6761.06
under there it's like seems like they're

6758.3 --> 6773.6
trying to bug farm and I think it works

6761.06 --> 6777.71
II anyway yeah it's kind of weird now I

6773.6 --> 6780.14
feel be weird for it the first time

6777.71 --> 6782.74
surprise after show it's funny though

6780.14 --> 6785.910000000001
how I can do that

6782.74 --> 6785.91
[Music]

6790.6 --> 6794.669000000001
[Music]

6796.07 --> 6801.45
yeah also I I definitely have noticed

6799.35 --> 6803.400000000001
that that George seems to be a little

6801.45 --> 6806.22
bit smaller than the other crows that

6803.4 --> 6810.2699999999995
I've seen around but I think it is

6806.22 --> 6813.75
because he's still very young the other

6810.27 --> 6820.290000000001
crows do kind of have like this more

6813.75 --> 6822.54
static stoic or adult ish attitude in

6820.29 --> 6824.58
front of it and he seems to be acting

6822.54 --> 6826.89
like a bit of a teenager sometimes so I

6824.58 --> 6829.22
think that they might be his parents or

6826.89 --> 6829.22
something

6841.689 --> 6847.269
all right well Philip Cooper glad you

6844.119 --> 6850.36
liked it so yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna

6847.269 --> 6852.6990000000005
step away now it was fun thanks everyone

6850.36 --> 6855.728999999999
again for sticking around and keeping

6852.699 --> 6857.799999999999
you the discussions going usually keeps

6855.729 --> 6864.459
on going for a while until my chat

6857.8 --> 6867.159000000001
closes down but yeah anyway thanks for

6864.459 --> 6873.969
being here this very long episode almost

6867.159 --> 6878.039
two hours brokens up for George mm-hmm
