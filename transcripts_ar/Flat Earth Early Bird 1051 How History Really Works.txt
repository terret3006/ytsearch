6.02 --> 37.32
[Music]

58.32 --> 60.719
good

59.68 --> 63.479
morning

60.719 --> 66.64

89.36 --> 94.159
that would be much appreciated

91.92 --> 94.159
so

94.32 --> 97.75899999999999
whether today is suddenly

97.92 --> 101.84
sadly cleared up

102.24 --> 105.19999999999999
and i'm really happy that i managed to

104.0 --> 108.24
go to bed

105.2 --> 108.24000000000001
a little earlier

110.0 --> 114.96
so that we'll be able to enjoy this

112.24 --> 116.88
morning

114.96 --> 120.24
because it's been like this

116.88 --> 122.079
crystal clear blue sky

120.24 --> 123.67999999999999
pretty much all morning

122.079 --> 125.67999999999999
and

123.68 --> 128.56
all night as well it was really clear

125.68 --> 132.399
this night

128.56 --> 132.399
and yeah that persisted so

133.2 --> 138.16
it's still

135.28 --> 140.879
it's not very warm outside but

138.16 --> 142.72
like with the sun it's really pleasant

140.879 --> 145.04
especially if you can stay out of the

142.72 --> 145.04
wind

146.4 --> 150.8
right so yeah a whole bunch of people

148.28 --> 152.959
unsurprisingly are having a lot having

150.8 --> 155.44
walks

152.959 --> 158.0
and it's the perfect time to do that

155.44 --> 160.8
when it's weather like this and sunday

158.0 --> 160.8
no less so

171.76 --> 178.959
hello logical observations

174.879 --> 178.959
whoever you are first in chat

179.599 --> 185.48
it is sunday the 24th of october 2021

187.2 --> 190.23899999999998
and

187.92 --> 192.07999999999998
yeah hopefully today's show will last a

190.239 --> 194.239
little longer than it did yesterday

192.08 --> 195.92000000000002
yesterday i really did not feel good at

194.239 --> 197.92000000000002
all

195.92 --> 200.319
it had nothing to do with like drinking

197.92 --> 204.72
or anything it was really just because

200.319 --> 204.72
i just went to bed way too late

206.319 --> 211.879
on friday

208.64 --> 211.879
and yeah

213.04 --> 217.519
like nothing really dramatic happened

214.959 --> 220.799
afterward or anything but i did like it

217.519 --> 220.799
did go under the shower

223.2 --> 229.67999999999998
and after that things were just fine

227.36 --> 229.68
right

231.84 --> 235.4
where is everyone

240.4 --> 242.64000000000001
hmm

252.72 --> 257.199
right so yeah

255.439 --> 260.88
despite yesterday's short show there was

257.199 --> 263.52000000000004
still ball busters live and i joined in

260.88 --> 265.759
although i was not super active i kind

263.52 --> 269.75899999999996
of just hung in the background because i

265.759 --> 271.759
still felt like it felt a little wonky

269.759 --> 273.68
and

271.759 --> 277.28000000000003
but it was a good show

273.68 --> 277.28000000000003
did bring some input

279.6 --> 283.84000000000003
hey america silver patriot good to see

281.6 --> 283.84000000000003
you

289.36 --> 294.0
so i hope that with today's

292.56 --> 295.68
sunlight

294.0 --> 297.759
i'll be able to

295.68 --> 300.88
hang in there a lot better

297.759 --> 300.88
than i did yesterday

308.0 --> 313.84
right so yeah how's everybody doing did

310.16 --> 313.84000000000003
anybody see the ball buster show

316.96 --> 321.919
all right also

319.68 --> 326.479
yeah made by jim bob did a very

321.919 --> 327.68
interesting video he reviewed

326.479 --> 330.96
uh

327.68 --> 333.759
dr john d

330.96 --> 336.96
his light test with the vacuum chamber

333.759 --> 340.08000000000004
and he basically he reviewed it and he

336.96 --> 342.15999999999997
like that guy is up for some

340.08 --> 346.08
serious technical conversations it's

342.16 --> 346.08000000000004
very interesting he even challenged

346.56 --> 350.96
ken wheeler

348.72 --> 354.24
over it

350.96 --> 354.23999999999995
like this is good stuff

357.36 --> 364.6
i wonder if john d caught on yet i did

360.16 --> 364.6
make a mention of it in the skype

378.8 --> 383.039
yeah no responses just yet i don't know

383.36 --> 387.44
right but

384.8 --> 387.44
that was good

391.6 --> 395.639
uh what else

396.24 --> 401.52
all right yeah i heard an early review

398.319 --> 401.52000000000004
of the new dune movie

402.72 --> 406.24
uh yeah without too much in content like

405.199 --> 409.039
fairy

406.24 --> 410.96000000000004
like by movie reviewer that i typically

409.039 --> 412.479
follow

410.96 --> 414.56
and yeah

412.479 --> 416.639
looks like it could be very interesting

414.56 --> 421.96
it's not a movie without its problems

416.639 --> 421.96000000000004
but it's like very stylish and

422.8 --> 426.08
apparently

423.919 --> 428.15999999999997
according to this guy and he is like

426.08 --> 430.4
also a dune fan

428.16 --> 431.84000000000003
so

430.4 --> 434.0
yeah

431.84 --> 436.63899999999995
very curious what what the movie will be

434.0 --> 439.12
like

436.639 --> 441.039
i'm not expecting to see it anytime soon

439.12 --> 443.36
since i typically don't go to movie

441.039 --> 446.56
theaters to watch these things and

443.36 --> 451.639
i don't like cam rips either those suck

446.56 --> 451.639
so i always wait till it's like first

451.919 --> 456.15999999999997
until like yeah

454.88 --> 458.56
later on

456.16 --> 462.72
i have no problem waiting on that or who

458.56 --> 467.199
knows maybe i'll go see it in a theater

462.72 --> 469.84000000000003
it's interesting i might actually try to

467.199 --> 472.16
maybe invite

469.84 --> 474.79999999999995
a roommate for that or something i don't

472.16 --> 476.319
know even if she does like sci-fi i have

474.8 --> 479.12
no idea

476.319 --> 481.03900000000004
fears the mind kill yeah yeah

479.12 --> 483.52
yeah the whole lore

481.039 --> 485.199
from dune is all very relevant

483.52 --> 486.639
especially now it's becoming more

485.199 --> 488.879
relevant

486.639 --> 490.479
but it's just good to hear that it

488.879 --> 493.03900000000004
it

490.479 --> 495.84
like it it didn't just straight out suck

493.039 --> 497.52
right because in this time period

495.84 --> 501.35999999999996
there's always kind of a risk with these

497.52 --> 501.35999999999996
remakes it's like oh god is this

501.44 --> 508.879
like how much are they gonna ruin it

506.0 --> 511.44
and well from this preliminary review it

508.879 --> 512.719
it wasn't that bad

511.44 --> 513.8389999999999
like

512.719 --> 516.08
it wasn't

513.839 --> 516.08
like

518.719 --> 521.719
anyway

521.919 --> 527.6
i got a good feeling about it and i

523.68 --> 527.5999999999999
always appreciate a good dune movie

528.08 --> 533.6
there was a dodgy tv miniseries

531.04 --> 538.16
yet there was australian miniseries and

533.6 --> 538.16
there was like a children of dune series

538.399 --> 542.24
it's been a long time since i last took

540.399 --> 544.32
a look at that

542.24 --> 548.6800000000001
like a long time ago

544.32 --> 548.6800000000001
i might want to recheck it out

559.839 --> 567.519
anyway hello tomonoid

563.36 --> 567.519
hbo also no cams

569.44 --> 574.08
oh really the dune movie was a hbo

572.8 --> 576.4799999999999
release

574.08 --> 578.24
huh all right

576.48 --> 582.32
in that case i'll probably be able to

578.24 --> 582.32
download it pretty easily

583.519 --> 585.839
huh

585.92 --> 591.279
all right so maybe i'll watch that

587.6 --> 592.8000000000001
somewhere this evening or something

591.279 --> 594.32
i'll check it out

592.8 --> 596.16
anyway

594.32 --> 598.8000000000001
right so those were some of the little

596.16 --> 601.36
points oh i actually got to make solid

598.8 --> 602.959
points without just

601.36 --> 604.64
feeling sick

602.959 --> 607.4399999999999
because that's kind of what it was like

604.64 --> 607.4399999999999
yesterday guys

608.0 --> 612.56
it's just i explained it it's like oh i

610.72 --> 614.0790000000001
just can't crap

612.56 --> 615.8389999999999
can't get a grip

614.079 --> 619.68
why can't i get a grip because as soon

615.839 --> 622.5600000000001
as i try i like get a surge of sickness

619.68 --> 623.8389999999999
nausea very annoying

622.56 --> 625.76
that's kind of what it was like

623.839 --> 627.9200000000001
yesterday and then yeah i end up just

625.76 --> 630.959
being silent even just not responding to

627.92 --> 633.68
things happening in chat

630.959 --> 635.76
because i didn't i couldn't muster the

633.68 --> 639.92
energy to properly

635.76 --> 639.92
get into it on arwenian level

641.36 --> 646.0
but i think i'll be able to do that

643.2 --> 646.9590000000001
better now

646.0 --> 649.2
right

646.959 --> 650.16
also i've noticed i i gotta watch out

649.2 --> 652.6400000000001
with like

650.16 --> 654.399
i got minty

652.64 --> 656.3199999999999
on advice

654.399 --> 658.079
and that seems to be working out great i

656.32 --> 659.6800000000001
think that for some reason when i'm like

658.079 --> 662.64
in this state

659.68 --> 664.56
like coffee is kind of a risk

662.64 --> 667.519
i might actually

664.56 --> 670.64
choose to skip

667.519 --> 670.64
hey what's this

671.6 --> 675.9200000000001
that's a torrance of it okay

673.6 --> 675.9200000000001
all right

676.0 --> 680.8
but i might just skip my coffees

678.56 --> 682.959
or my coffee tomorrow i did have one

680.8 --> 685.519
today but like immediately after i felt

682.959 --> 685.5189999999999
like oof

686.079 --> 688.8
like the tension

687.6 --> 692.0790000000001
again

688.8 --> 694.64
but it's kind of going away

692.079 --> 698.399
might help that i didn't just finish my

694.64 --> 700.399
coffee as i did yesterday i pretty much

698.399 --> 701.839
gulped it down right before starting the

700.399 --> 704.72
show i think that

701.839 --> 706.72
also contributed

704.72 --> 709.12
to that situation

706.72 --> 709.12
anyway

710.399 --> 714.12
hello george sanford

722.24 --> 728.48
all right lots of turns okay so i'm not

724.639 --> 731.48
gonna have to go to the movie theaters

728.48 --> 731.48
uh

795.36 --> 801.24
right

797.76 --> 801.24
okay anyway

801.76 --> 806.639
can i repeat who reviewed the dr john d

804.88 --> 809.279
video missed the name yeah that was made

806.639 --> 809.279
by jim bob

809.36 --> 813.88
he's actually in my favorite list

816.56 --> 822.2399999999999
i'll link you up to the channel

819.68 --> 824.8
right and he follows flat earth debates

822.24 --> 826.639
and quantum eraser

824.8 --> 829.12
pretty closely

826.639 --> 831.279
he's very interested in that academic

829.12 --> 834.079
and technical side

831.279 --> 836.32
also he likes to discuss just about

834.079 --> 838.3199999999999
things like gravity's

836.32 --> 842.44
depending of space time like what that

838.32 --> 842.44
is where it comes from and

847.04 --> 851.5999999999999
uh

847.92 --> 853.5999999999999
yeah and now light and i love that

851.6 --> 856.399
because i think i could probably have

853.6 --> 858.48
some discussions with him one-on-one

856.399 --> 860.639
about it right about my conception of

858.48 --> 865.399
light

860.639 --> 865.399
infinitely divisible beams

872.24 --> 875.6800000000001
right but he brought up an interesting

873.839 --> 878.32
dilemma also

875.68 --> 881.4399999999999
yesterday concerning lights how it is

878.32 --> 883.12
like yeah you can't

881.44 --> 884.9590000000001
have light without

883.12 --> 888.16
you don't know if there even is light

884.959 --> 888.16
without a receiver

889.04 --> 892.48
and we can only even see like a beam of

891.44 --> 896.0
light

892.48 --> 899.279
through its reflection on the air or

896.0 --> 901.839
particles within the air

899.279 --> 904.16
right so that's like part of the

901.839 --> 907.8800000000001
video

904.16 --> 907.88
we discussed yesterday

912.24 --> 916.839
i'll just link you up to that one

913.839 --> 916.839
directly

930.079 --> 933.079
uh

937.51 --> 940.5699999999999
[Music]

956.0 --> 959.6
it's kind of funny too by the way

957.44 --> 962.24
because

959.6 --> 964.639
i think sometimes like jim bob also kind

962.24 --> 966.72
of has these weird tension

964.639 --> 968.72
things kind of like i do

966.72 --> 972.8000000000001
but he's worked out

968.72 --> 972.8000000000001
kind of like these voice techniques

973.92 --> 978.0
to soothing it out

975.92 --> 981.399
and it seems to work out very well for

978.0 --> 981.399
him it's interesting

987.6 --> 991.12
so maybe

988.959 --> 993.4399999999999
i'll start trying something in a similar

991.12 --> 997.32
direction because yeah the the low voice

993.44 --> 997.32
vibration like uh

997.519 --> 1000.5600000000001
it does kind of like

1001.519 --> 1006.5600000000001
massage very slightly

1004.079 --> 1011.8389999999999
like the typical regions where these

1006.56 --> 1011.8389999999999
tensions tend to spawn up so that yeah

1013.839 --> 1018.6
yeah i pay attention to things

1045.679 --> 1050.88
right yeah completely missed out on

1048.079 --> 1053.12
flatter day night with

1050.88 --> 1054.679
martin litke

1053.12 --> 1058.4799999999998
because it pretty much went

1054.679 --> 1061.88
simultaneously with qe

1058.48 --> 1061.88
but oh well

1066.48 --> 1071.84
right so yeah guys i'm up to

1068.88 --> 1071.8400000000001
for talking about

1072.559 --> 1077.36
well

1074.24 --> 1081.16
anything as long as it's not too

1077.36 --> 1081.1599999999999
paranoid or whatever

1116.24 --> 1119.24
so

1132.32 --> 1138.96
hello anybody there

1135.12 --> 1138.9599999999998
i see 15 watching but

1141.12 --> 1144.4799999999998
not getting a lot of chat

1146.4 --> 1152.0
hey stone monkey

1148.84 --> 1154.8799999999999
3d what you think of so trump's social

1152.0 --> 1157.919
media oh he did it

1154.88 --> 1157.919
i i didn't know

1159.28 --> 1162.84
what's it called

1218.64 --> 1223.5200000000002
still testing

1220.48 --> 1226.52
truth social media oh dear

1223.52 --> 1226.52
sir

1245.52 --> 1248.559
right still in the testing phase okay

1247.36 --> 1250.24
that

1248.559 --> 1252.96
because

1250.24 --> 1256.0
like i would be expecting like at least

1252.96 --> 1258.4
infowars to quickly remind us about it

1256.0 --> 1260.32
and i haven't seen any articles to

1258.4 --> 1261.76
address that just yet so i guess it's

1260.32 --> 1264.559
still in

1261.76 --> 1264.559
in beta

1265.6 --> 1268.6
right

1279.44 --> 1282.44
uh

1313.919 --> 1318.0
right so

1315.52 --> 1320.0
yeah there's not much to test about that

1318.0 --> 1322.159
or yeah to look at i could look it up

1320.0 --> 1322.159
but

1329.919 --> 1332.919
hello

1354.88 --> 1358.0
tos right

1358.72 --> 1364.4
but you know wow you can't even

1362.0 --> 1366.32
well i guess they had to

1364.4 --> 1368.64
yeah it's too soon to say what that even

1366.32 --> 1368.6399999999999
means

1369.28 --> 1374.72
because yeah it technically would be

1371.44 --> 1376.799
kind of ridiculous to not criticize the

1374.72 --> 1379.2
platform as it's still in development

1376.799 --> 1381.44
stage and like that's how they

1379.2 --> 1384.48
are able to improve it is by people

1381.44 --> 1384.48
criticizing it

1386.88 --> 1389.8400000000001
but yeah whatever

1407.679 --> 1411.1200000000001
hmm

1409.44 --> 1413.44
are you seeking star wars thanks for the

1411.12 --> 1413.4399999999998
link

1415.36 --> 1418.84
oh god

1443.039 --> 1445.84
hmm

1468.48 --> 1473.0
all right anyways thanks for link

1485.919 --> 1488.919
ugh

1507.679 --> 1510.679
so

1519.44 --> 1522.44
um

1579.44 --> 1582.44
hmm

1605.919 --> 1608.919
hmm

1615.76 --> 1620.72
do flat earthers talk much about crude

1618.32 --> 1622.96
oil in its origins

1620.72 --> 1625.6000000000001
hello hungary lion

1622.96 --> 1627.6000000000001
well it is among

1625.6 --> 1629.039
the subjects sort of

1627.6 --> 1632.0
it's not really

1629.039 --> 1634.559
talked about that elaborately

1632.0 --> 1638.159
but yes the whole crude oil thing it's

1634.559 --> 1638.1589999999999
not fossils it's not

1638.84 --> 1644.399
fossils from what i've gathered it's

1641.679 --> 1646.88
actually a biotic

1644.399 --> 1649.039
oil that comes from bacteria that under

1646.88 --> 1650.48
high pressure

1649.039 --> 1652.64
transform

1650.48 --> 1655.84
rock

1652.64 --> 1655.8400000000001
into crude oil

1661.6 --> 1665.559
hey slow mo moon buggy

1691.76 --> 1697.52
how dare you it's dinosaur juices

1695.6 --> 1700.52
hello classical homeopath good to see

1697.52 --> 1700.52
you

1718.159 --> 1721.6000000000001
russia said oh really

1723.52 --> 1728.399
russia

1724.48 --> 1731.679
that's not very specific but okay

1728.399 --> 1735.2399999999998
it is replenishing yes

1731.679 --> 1735.24
hey tony whitcomb

1752.08 --> 1756.52
okay tony whitcomb that's interesting

1774.24 --> 1779.039
yeah yeah tony wait i've got a follow-up

1776.96 --> 1781.8400000000001
question or yeah question that would

1779.039 --> 1781.84
follow that up

1783.12 --> 1788.08
i guess follow-up question is the right

1784.88 --> 1792.48
word for it but like

1788.08 --> 1792.48
did perspective apply like was it

1792.84 --> 1796.399
actually following

1796.96 --> 1801.52
perspective laws as it was moving into

1799.12 --> 1805.2399999999998
the distance did it decrease in angular

1801.52 --> 1805.24
speed and all that

1823.039 --> 1828.36
that what how hungry lion that is weird

1841.76 --> 1844.76
so

1890.88 --> 1894.5590000000002
okay tony whitcomb didn't change

1894.64 --> 1897.2
size

1895.919 --> 1900.3200000000002
right

1897.2 --> 1903.679
but did it also

1900.32 --> 1905.6789999999999
change angular speed or not right

1903.679 --> 1907.919
because that would be much bigger

1905.679 --> 1909.44
indication whether it is a

1907.919 --> 1912.64
celestial

1909.44 --> 1914.64
and therefore holographic phenomenon

1912.64 --> 1916.5590000000002
versus

1914.64 --> 1918.8400000000001
something that is physically being

1916.559 --> 1921.6
projected in a location

1918.84 --> 1922.8799999999999
or more

1921.6 --> 1925.36
yeah more

1922.88 --> 1929.2
difficult alternative an actual object

1925.36 --> 1929.1999999999998
somehow floating up there

1933.039 --> 1938.559
right because if it's a celestial

1935.12 --> 1941.6
projection then there would be no

1938.559 --> 1942.799
angular size changes typically and there

1941.6 --> 1947.48
would be

1942.799 --> 1947.48
no angular speed changes either

1969.2 --> 1973.039
depopulation because giant oil fields

1971.36 --> 1974.84
depleting

1973.039 --> 1980.32
well they might

1974.84 --> 1980.32
be trying to use that as an excuse but

1982.0 --> 1987.32
that's totally insane

1984.32 --> 1987.32
really

1996.96 --> 2003.799
i mean there's there's so much oil

1999.919 --> 2003.7990000000002
in the world that's insane

2006.48 --> 2010.88
right you just go from one well to

2008.799 --> 2013.36
another and like oh it depletes okay now

2010.88 --> 2015.679
then you leave it alone for a while you

2013.36 --> 2018.24
move on to the next

2015.679 --> 2021.44
kind of like crop rotation

2018.24 --> 2021.44
except with oil

2025.919 --> 2033.159
hey nathan oakley yeah i noticed the

2028.08 --> 2033.1589999999999
upload i haven't watched it yet but

2033.44 --> 2037.44
i'll check it out as soon as my show is

2035.2 --> 2037.44
over

2045.44 --> 2050.48
price of oil going up right now

2048.24 --> 2053.4799999999996
just politics yes

2050.48 --> 2053.48
definitely

2089.52 --> 2092.52
blue

2182.72 --> 2187.56
right so yeah i can't really watch the

2184.56 --> 2187.56
video

2188.24 --> 2191.359
so i have no idea like even though it's

2190.16 --> 2193.44
very short

2191.359 --> 2197.56
it's no yeah it's just the guy talking

2193.44 --> 2197.56
on screen so it's no use

2200.8 --> 2206.28
watching that

2202.8 --> 2206.28
without sound

2238.0 --> 2242.68
yes seeking style water indeed

2244.96 --> 2250.32
although if you tell a baller that

2248.4 --> 2252.96
using the word elevation they say yeah

2250.32 --> 2257.48
but elevation is based on

2252.96 --> 2257.48
distance to the core of the earth

2257.599 --> 2261.44
of course it's all perfectly flat

2261.52 --> 2266.079
but yeah that's when you say elevation

2264.0 --> 2267.52
that triggers the ball spherical

2266.079 --> 2271.6400000000003
mechanics

2267.52 --> 2271.64
but the bendiness of that

2283.839 --> 2286.839
dirt

2300.4 --> 2305.359
yeah i'm looking forward to seeing a

2302.48 --> 2305.359
friday show

2311.2 --> 2317.24
i was on it and it was active and it was

2313.52 --> 2317.24
a good show i think

2347.92 --> 2351.64
yeah omega genesis

2360.24 --> 2363.24
so

2384.0 --> 2388.96
yeah classical homeopath yeah that's

2386.16 --> 2391.359
what i was trying to say

2388.96 --> 2393.68
they just apply circumndicular geometry

2391.359 --> 2396.839
and it's all spherical again it's what

2393.68 --> 2396.839
they do

2416.64 --> 2420.16
when

2418.64 --> 2422.319
attorney whitcomb

2420.16 --> 2424.3999999999996
look if you want to make me check

2422.319 --> 2426.96
something out you

2424.4 --> 2429.119
link it up

2426.96 --> 2432.319
please

2429.119 --> 2434.319
just like trying to look for channels

2432.319 --> 2436.64
and all that

2434.319 --> 2439.359
i have very little success with that

2436.64 --> 2441.359
it's usually kind of a hassle to to find

2439.359 --> 2443.44
something specific

2441.359 --> 2444.96
right that's why i like to help out the

2443.44 --> 2447.76
chat

2444.96 --> 2450.8
by basically placing the links of things

2447.76 --> 2450.8
i've watched and all that

2450.96 --> 2455.92
so that you don't have to like oh now i

2453.839 --> 2459.7599999999998
have to look it up somehow and hope that

2455.92 --> 2462.76
youtube will actually help me find it

2459.76 --> 2462.76
right

2471.119 --> 2476.8
right all measurement from the center

2473.28 --> 2479.119
point that has never been measured yeah

2476.8 --> 2481.6800000000003
it has been

2479.119 --> 2483.92
calculated

2481.68 --> 2483.9199999999996
right

2486.16 --> 2490.3999999999996
you didn't realize you had a wrench to

2488.0 --> 2490.4
do that

2490.88 --> 2495.8
dude you've got a wrench for like half a

2492.8 --> 2495.8
year

2525.599 --> 2530.8
a wild guess

2528.64 --> 2533.5989999999997
well circumticular geometry is not a

2530.8 --> 2535.04
wild guess it's just

2533.599 --> 2536.7200000000003
based on

2535.04 --> 2539.2799999999997
an assumption that it has to be

2536.72 --> 2539.2799999999997
spherical

2541.28 --> 2546.079
like the gas in itself is not wild it's

2543.68 --> 2548.8799999999997
just that the presuppositional is the

2546.079 --> 2551.3590000000004
presupposition of the sphere is

2548.88 --> 2553.28
what you could call that wild

2551.359 --> 2556.48
especially in the face of all the

2553.28 --> 2556.48
evidence it's wild

2561.839 --> 2564.839
what

2602.24 --> 2605.5989999999997
i

2603.359 --> 2607.839
only vaguely remember that name i don't

2605.599 --> 2610.079
know who that is

2607.839 --> 2612.64
let me google it

2610.079 --> 2615.44
see what wikipedia has to say

2612.64 --> 2618.839
oh astronomer

2615.44 --> 2618.839
he has paintings

2642.88 --> 2648.119
father of observational astronomy

2648.88 --> 2653.359
father of the scientific method really

2654.079 --> 2656.48
okay

2657.52 --> 2662.24
and the father of modern science

2660.48 --> 2665.72
okay

2662.24 --> 2665.72
that was unexpected

2680.8 --> 2683.8
so

2690.079 --> 2694.319
right so

2691.2 --> 2697.1189999999997
why exactly are you assuming that he

2694.319 --> 2697.119
didn't exist

2699.359 --> 2705.68
i mean the guy has paintings of him

2703.52 --> 2708.92
that's not a hundred percent guarantee

2705.68 --> 2708.9199999999996
but still

2718.48 --> 2724.319
huh all right tony whitcomb well

2722.16 --> 2726.72
look you're very responsible with your

2724.319 --> 2729.04
wrench here so yeah you don't have to

2726.72 --> 2729.04
worry

2729.28 --> 2733.8
you can put your links here

2734.48 --> 2738.2400000000002
as long as it's interesting that is

2738.64 --> 2743.4
hey one for the unit good to see you

2781.839 --> 2784.839
hmm

2795.92 --> 2799.52
okay

2798.079 --> 2800.8390000000004
thanks for the link

2799.52 --> 2802.48
looks kind of

2800.839 --> 2807.319
interesting

2802.48 --> 2807.319
dark matter isn't dark it's invisible

2825.2 --> 2829.7999999999997
all right anyway be back in two minutes

2924.96 --> 2927.96
hmm

2939.68 --> 2943.839
history is a massive lie

2944.48 --> 2948.319
well maybe part of it

2952.48 --> 2956.079
well

2953.2 --> 2958.319
let's just say that lots of history is

2956.079 --> 2962.88
certainly put

2958.319 --> 2962.88
in a very specific context

2963.119 --> 2965.359
right

2968.559 --> 2973.0400000000004
and that context

2970.4 --> 2973.04
is like

2973.119 --> 2977.44
yeah you could if you understand how

2975.52 --> 2980.079
things work in this world if you figure

2977.44 --> 2982.079
that out during your life you might also

2980.079 --> 2985.079
realize like yeah that context is all

2982.079 --> 2985.079
nonsense

2985.119 --> 2989.6800000000003
a lot of it is

2986.72 --> 2992.72
the way it's told it's nonsense

2989.68 --> 2994.24
but that doesn't necessarily mean that

2992.72 --> 2996.16
none of them

2994.24 --> 2998.4799999999996
existed right

2996.16 --> 3002.72
they might simply have been caught up

2998.48 --> 3006.88
people of the games of their time

3002.72 --> 3008.319
right and then written into history

3006.88 --> 3010.4
for

3008.319 --> 3013.839
yeah

3010.4 --> 3013.839
government reasons

3016.24 --> 3019.2
right

3017.28 --> 3020.88
especially before

3019.2 --> 3022.24
modern society

3020.88 --> 3024.559
the history

3022.24 --> 3025.52
was quite literally

3024.559 --> 3026.88
written

3025.52 --> 3029.44
by

3026.88 --> 3032.1600000000003
by kings and all that like they they

3029.44 --> 3036.16
were the ones to a point like how it was

3032.16 --> 3036.16
gonna be written about everything

3038.0 --> 3041.559
a lot of the time

3051.44 --> 3055.839
rollerblading in this incident yeah yeah

3059.839 --> 3064.319
pyramids and blocks being pushed over

3062.16 --> 3065.68
logs of yeah that is absolutely

3064.319 --> 3066.96
preposterous

3065.68 --> 3068.8799999999997
i know

3066.96 --> 3070.64
like where would they even get all that

3068.88 --> 3074.96
wood in that region

3070.64 --> 3077.5989999999997
unless for some reason it was all

3074.96 --> 3077.599
beautiful

3077.68 --> 3080.68
forests

3082.16 --> 3087.52
it yeah it's like it's all very

3085.319 --> 3090.52
counter-intuitive the way they described

3087.52 --> 3090.52
it

3102.96 --> 3108.04
aliens helped oh of course

3115.28 --> 3120.88
no no it wasn't made like that right the

3119.359 --> 3124.319
part

3120.88 --> 3126.96
probably the most important part about

3124.319 --> 3128.8
historical narrative like

3126.96 --> 3130.64
all of it

3128.8 --> 3133.3590000000004
all of it right

3130.64 --> 3135.52
just can you imagine how much that is

3133.359 --> 3137.119
well the narrative context that they

3135.52 --> 3138.8
placed this in

3137.119 --> 3141.599
always

3138.8 --> 3144.4
always says

3141.599 --> 3147.76
the further back we go

3144.4 --> 3149.92
the dumber people were

3147.76 --> 3152.4
the more confused

3149.92 --> 3154.079
the more easily tied up with religion oh

3152.4 --> 3156.319
my god so bad

3154.079 --> 3156.319
and

3156.559 --> 3162.4
yeah the less technology they had that's

3159.599 --> 3165.6800000000003
always the narrative when it comes to

3162.4 --> 3165.6800000000003
history right it's like

3167.29 --> 3170.4
[Music]

3168.88 --> 3173.44
iron age

3170.4 --> 3175.28
bronze age stone age

3173.44 --> 3178.319
and they just put it in that downward

3175.28 --> 3179.2000000000003
ladder towards the past that's

3178.319 --> 3182.48
the

3179.2 --> 3185.839
the standard formula for historical

3182.48 --> 3188.0
narrative every single time it's always

3185.839 --> 3189.2799999999997
further you go to the past the less they

3188.0 --> 3191.839
have

3189.28 --> 3192.88
every single time you know that's the

3191.839 --> 3195.2799999999997
key

3192.88 --> 3197.119
component of historical narrative in the

3195.28 --> 3200.1600000000003
modern sense

3197.119 --> 3203.28
now here's the reality

3200.16 --> 3205.52
that's absolute horseshit

3203.28 --> 3205.52
like

3206.64 --> 3215.2
all these ages had their own

3210.16 --> 3215.2
research their own types of technology

3215.76 --> 3222.0
either like spiritual development or

3218.64 --> 3224.48
just engineering of different sorts with

3222.0 --> 3226.0
whatever came up and then they further

3224.48 --> 3227.44
develop it

3226.0 --> 3229.52
right

3227.44 --> 3231.52
so to suggest that the further back you

3229.52 --> 3232.559
go less there is

3231.52 --> 3234.559
that's

3232.559 --> 3237.3590000000004
wrong

3234.559 --> 3239.76
in ancient times there were pretty hefty

3237.359 --> 3241.7599999999998
technologies not like anything that we

3239.76 --> 3245.44
have now

3241.76 --> 3248.48
but for its time hefty

3245.44 --> 3251.28
and probably also secretly applied

3248.48 --> 3254.16
technologies right like oh keeping

3251.28 --> 3255.119
technological advantages secret

3254.16 --> 3258.24
yeah

3255.119 --> 3261.2000000000003
that's quite logical and that gear is i

3258.24 --> 3263.68
guarantee that is part of like

3261.2 --> 3264.8799999999997
government even in the past so there's

3263.68 --> 3266.5589999999997
like these

3264.88 --> 3269.04
things revealed like

3266.559 --> 3271.76
certain roman temples

3269.04 --> 3273.92
had actual steam

3271.76 --> 3275.599
powered

3273.92 --> 3276.799
doors

3275.599 --> 3279.6800000000003
and such

3276.799 --> 3280.799
serious

3279.68 --> 3283.9199999999996
they would

3280.799 --> 3286.16
do it for theatrical things and all that

3283.92 --> 3288.16
and they would have actual steam power

3286.16 --> 3290.0789999999997
pipes and all that really

3288.16 --> 3291.1189999999997
and that's

3290.079 --> 3293.52
like

3291.119 --> 3296.1600000000003
supposedly 2000 years ago

3293.52 --> 3299.28
right that wasn't supposed to exist yet

3296.16 --> 3300.799
they had it and they applied it

3299.28 --> 3302.88
right that's

3300.799 --> 3304.16
and that's even kind of officially

3302.88 --> 3306.2400000000002
admitted

3304.16 --> 3308.319
so if you take that into account then

3306.24 --> 3311.2
you have to realize like yeah oh all

3308.319 --> 3311.92
those things are not built with a bunch

3311.2 --> 3314.64
of

3311.92 --> 3317.359
half apes and sticks

3314.64 --> 3317.359
and ropes

3317.599 --> 3321.2000000000003
because that is kind of how it's been

3319.2 --> 3324.5589999999997
portrayed now that's complete [ __ ]

3321.2 --> 3324.5589999999997
no the pyramids

3324.72 --> 3327.359
had to be

3325.839 --> 3330.48
devices

3327.359 --> 3332.72
that were built for a good reason

3330.48 --> 3336.88
and probably a lot easier than we take

3332.72 --> 3338.799
granted for a lot easier very quickly

3336.88 --> 3340.96
they probably use stone casting

3338.799 --> 3342.24
especially for the outside blocks which

3340.96 --> 3345.2
would

3342.24 --> 3346.16
is kind of similar to modern

3345.2 --> 3348.5589999999997
uh

3346.16 --> 3351.2
concrete casting although it's much more

3348.559 --> 3352.48
reliable it doesn't break down over the

3351.2 --> 3355.2799999999997
ages

3352.48 --> 3357.52
right it's kind of like stone cat stone

3355.28 --> 3360.2400000000002
casting is kind of the original concrete

3357.52 --> 3362.64
is kind of the bastardization

3360.24 --> 3365.1189999999997
of concrete of yeah of stone casting

3362.64 --> 3366.72
concrete is the bastardization of stone

3365.119 --> 3368.2400000000002
casting

3366.72 --> 3370.319
so they had that

3368.24 --> 3372.799
they probably did all kinds of amazing

3370.319 --> 3374.96
things and

3372.799 --> 3377.359
yeah they're still like these

3374.96 --> 3379.92
giant rocks

3377.359 --> 3381.119
that are very difficult to just

3379.92 --> 3383.04
transport

3381.119 --> 3385.52
and that makes me suspect that giants

3383.04 --> 3387.599
were involved because actual physical

3385.52 --> 3390.72
giants that were very tall would make

3387.599 --> 3394.079
transporting those things so much easier

3390.72 --> 3396.24
like infinitely much easier like

3394.079 --> 3397.92
even in modern day

3396.24 --> 3400.9599999999996
with modern

3397.92 --> 3403.2000000000003
like cranes and giant machines

3400.96 --> 3406.079
having like 20 meter tall giants it

3403.2 --> 3410.319
would probably be a lot easier if

3406.079 --> 3412.319
compare like a giant is a being

3410.319 --> 3414.72
if it can survive like that then it's

3412.319 --> 3418.079
probably very efficient right it doesn't

3414.72 --> 3420.319
fall over and then destroy it has to be

3418.079 --> 3422.559
oh no

3420.319 --> 3426.96
it breaks now we have to replace half of

3422.559 --> 3428.48
it right no it's just a giant

3426.96 --> 3430.96
so

3428.48 --> 3432.72
the pyramids were probably built a lot

3430.96 --> 3435.68
quicker and they had a function or it

3432.72 --> 3435.68
would make no sense

3437.2 --> 3444.04
hieroglyphs include spacecraft well

3439.599 --> 3444.04
spacecraft is a big word

3446.0 --> 3451.92
right they might have seen

3448.799 --> 3454.24
the same spiritual phenomenon

3451.92 --> 3457.119
as we do in these days right i think

3454.24 --> 3460.24
that a lot of ufo things

3457.119 --> 3463.52
were probably

3460.24 --> 3465.7599999999998
like they're extra dimensional

3463.52 --> 3469.119
they're in the spirit realm and they've

3465.76 --> 3471.119
probably been there and been like

3469.119 --> 3474.1600000000003
showing up

3471.119 --> 3477.119
for a long time

3474.16 --> 3479.2
so i'm not surprised that in egyptian

3477.119 --> 3481.119
days as they they were like which is

3479.2 --> 3483.2799999999997
after the pyramids were built they were

3481.119 --> 3485.599
not built by the egyptians

3483.28 --> 3487.8390000000004
but they were probably also into like

3485.599 --> 3489.04
drugs and hallucinogenics for their

3487.839 --> 3491.359
priesthood

3489.04 --> 3493.68
for exploring

3491.359 --> 3498.799
the mind and the other realms and they

3493.68 --> 3498.799
probably did like see flying craft

3498.88 --> 3504.6400000000003
and that's why that was included in

3502.0 --> 3504.64
their writing

3505.2 --> 3508.0789999999997
in their depictions

3512.4 --> 3516.799
giants that could levitate stuff no no

3514.96 --> 3517.599
they wouldn't need to they just pick it

3516.799 --> 3519.44
up

3517.599 --> 3521.52
it's like okay

3519.44 --> 3523.44
you got

3521.52 --> 3525.68
three four giants

3523.44 --> 3527.68
you have a monolith of like

3525.68 --> 3529.44
20 ton

3527.68 --> 3530.96
and they just pick it up

3529.44 --> 3533.2000000000003
three of them and they just carry it

3530.96 --> 3536.319
like a really heavy thing

3533.2 --> 3538.96
but yeah like who else could do that

3536.319 --> 3541.359
you can't just roll it around or float

3538.96 --> 3543.28
it or something that's crazy

3541.359 --> 3545.839
like you just gotta be big enough to

3543.28 --> 3545.8390000000004
pick it up

3548.559 --> 3552.799
right

3549.359 --> 3557.2799999999997
and that those are exclusively for the

3552.799 --> 3559.359
rocks that were whole that had grains

3557.28 --> 3562.799
that show that they are like how they

3559.359 --> 3567.359
were originally they weren't like cast

3562.799 --> 3567.359
like the outside of the pyramid stones

3568.319 --> 3577.2799999999997
magic dance no

3571.04 --> 3577.2799999999997
no just giants just really big humans

3578.88 --> 3584.7200000000003
or maybe even like

3581.119 --> 3587.44
from an older species or older probably

3584.72 --> 3589.2
just as old as humans

3587.44 --> 3592.2400000000002
that were giants or

3589.2 --> 3593.2799999999997
cyclopses or something right

3592.24 --> 3595.5989999999997
it's kind of

3593.28 --> 3597.8390000000004
shoved in my in my face during playing

3595.599 --> 3600.2400000000002
my game

3597.839 --> 3602.16
because there is this this really like i

3600.24 --> 3603.839
went in this dungeon and there's like

3602.16 --> 3605.92
the cyclopses

3603.839 --> 3608.0789999999997
from the ancient past in that game that

3605.92 --> 3611.88
that's their story

3608.079 --> 3611.88
it was really fascinating

3616.079 --> 3619.8390000000004
so who knows were they

3618.079 --> 3623.28
what kind of

3619.839 --> 3625.839
giants were they were they like

3623.28 --> 3628.4
humans altered humans were they like a

3625.839 --> 3632.0
half species human and then some kind of

3628.4 --> 3632.96
vagina a titan or a cyclops or who knows

3632.0 --> 3635.2
what

3632.96 --> 3639.2
they came from but

3635.2 --> 3639.2
20 meters tall on record

3641.119 --> 3645.599
and they could live incredible times yes

3646.4 --> 3651.359
it could be the original humans from the

3648.48 --> 3653.119
bible well proof there's a theory very

3651.359 --> 3657.48
fascinating one

3653.119 --> 3657.48
the nephilim no

3663.92 --> 3667.76
i don't think yeah no

3668.64 --> 3672.8799999999997
this can't be the original humans from

3670.799 --> 3676.7599999999998
the bible and the nephilim

3672.88 --> 3676.76
that doesn't make any sense

3688.079 --> 3691.7200000000003
hello moon shadow

3702.72 --> 3708.319
people have always had a better grasp on

3704.48 --> 3708.319
reality in the past well george sanford

3709.76 --> 3716.0
not necessarily it's just that in this

3712.96 --> 3718.4
age especially right now

3716.0 --> 3719.839
we're in the age of illusions like on my

3718.4 --> 3724.7200000000003
time chart

3719.839 --> 3726.799
of of history my personal arwenian chart

3724.72 --> 3730.5589999999997
we're in the age of illusions that means

3726.799 --> 3732.4
distraction distraction is what gets you

3730.559 --> 3734.0
away from

3732.4 --> 3735.52
getting real

3734.0 --> 3736.319
right

3735.52 --> 3738.0
now

3736.319 --> 3740.079
in the past there might have also been

3738.0 --> 3741.359
periods where people were extremely

3740.079 --> 3743.3590000000004
distracted

3741.359 --> 3746.64
and they would have been just as stupid

3743.359 --> 3749.359
as people are now really just like this

3746.64 --> 3751.68
just like that that is not unique to

3749.359 --> 3753.5989999999997
this age people it isn't

3751.68 --> 3756.96
what's happening out there

3753.599 --> 3759.599
how crazy people get how

3756.96 --> 3760.96
just going over every border

3759.599 --> 3762.2400000000002
socially

3760.96 --> 3763.52
mentally

3762.24 --> 3765.9199999999996
that's

3763.52 --> 3768.559
not unique to this time that's happened

3765.92 --> 3772.64
before throughout history it's part of

3768.559 --> 3775.599
the empire cycle it's what happens

3772.64 --> 3777.44
massive distraction on purpose

3775.599 --> 3778.319
people getting distracted getting caught

3777.44 --> 3780.079
up

3778.319 --> 3782.88
being pulled into

3780.079 --> 3785.2000000000003
lunacy

3782.88 --> 3786.6400000000003
that's not unique

3785.2 --> 3789.1189999999997
but it is

3786.64 --> 3792.0
much more persistent now

3789.119 --> 3792.0
that's the problem

3793.44 --> 3796.7200000000003
right in the past when such periods

3795.52 --> 3799.44
would happen

3796.72 --> 3801.2
it would usually end pretty quickly

3799.44 --> 3803.44
because yeah when

3801.2 --> 3806.16
some group gets completely demonic and

3803.44 --> 3808.559
[ __ ] because that's what that is

3806.16 --> 3810.24
so far away from human

3808.559 --> 3812.48
in their actions that they've just

3810.24 --> 3814.3999999999996
become demonic

3812.48 --> 3816.48
and then the people that wouldn't stand

3814.4 --> 3818.0
for that they would freaking kill them

3816.48 --> 3820.079
all

3818.0 --> 3823.359
or behead them all

3820.079 --> 3825.2000000000003
right serious that's part of the reason

3823.359 --> 3826.88
kind of why i've been

3825.2 --> 3829.839
so

3826.88 --> 3829.839
unrelenting

3832.079 --> 3835.7200000000003
in my own way

3840.4 --> 3842.7200000000003
because

3841.599 --> 3847.119
it

3842.72 --> 3847.1189999999997
it doesn't just fade into nothingness

3847.68 --> 3851.44
or it goes out with a bang

3851.52 --> 3856.88
or some extreme mass hysteria where they

3854.72 --> 3859.2
literally just like cultists all decide

3856.88 --> 3860.559
to kill themselves because they

3859.2 --> 3863.2799999999997
did something

3860.559 --> 3865.28
to themselves for misled reasons and

3863.28 --> 3867.92
then ended up with like

3865.28 --> 3870.559
horrible pain and nightmares

3867.92 --> 3872.64
sounds a little familiar

3870.559 --> 3876.88
doesn't it

3872.64 --> 3880.0
but what's been happening with these

3876.88 --> 3881.039
yeah that's not unique to this time

3880.0 --> 3884.559
period

3881.039 --> 3889.28
that sort of thing has happened before

3884.559 --> 3889.28
probably not even in the too far past

3889.359 --> 3894.5589999999997
but throughout history guaranteed

3892.0 --> 3898.039
that thing has happened before this is

3894.559 --> 3898.039
part of the cycle

3915.039 --> 3922.92
there's psyops from russia and china

3918.24 --> 3922.9199999999996
what the hell are you talking about

3926.799 --> 3931.119
oh it's all russian have you ever

3928.88 --> 3934.0
considered that maybe just the uk and

3931.119 --> 3937.039
the us is just completely [ __ ]

3934.0 --> 3939.359
themselves over

3937.039 --> 3941.44
why is it russia and china's fault is

3939.359 --> 3943.44
that like a last

3941.44 --> 3946.0
last desperate

3943.44 --> 3949.839
extremely desperate

3946.0 --> 3953.44
attempt to blame the others again hoping

3949.839 --> 3954.72
that you will even survive through it

3953.44 --> 3956.0
because that's kind of what it sounds

3954.72 --> 3959.0
like to me

3956.0 --> 3959.0
toiling

3974.16 --> 3979.5989999999997
right

3975.76 --> 3983.119
yeah and this very big nations

3979.599 --> 3986.48
with a lot of power russia and china

3983.119 --> 3989.52
they're not just going to like lay down

3986.48 --> 3991.599
arms and do everything to help the poor

3989.52 --> 3994.48
old us

3991.599 --> 3995.599
and the uk because it's a complicated

3994.48 --> 3999.119
game

3995.599 --> 4001.92
that they're all playing right they have

3999.119 --> 4003.28
interest that it doesn't completely

4001.92 --> 4006.319
explode

4003.28 --> 4008.4
but they also have interest to kind of

4006.319 --> 4010.48
be better than everybody else because

4008.4 --> 4014.6800000000003
that gives them an advantage and they

4010.48 --> 4014.68
they balance it out carefully

4025.359 --> 4028.359
so

4035.92 --> 4038.2400000000002
hmm

4039.839 --> 4043.88
interesting slow moment buggy

4051.28 --> 4055.28
yeah

4052.559 --> 4056.48
that's interesting san ho i've heard of

4055.28 --> 4061.079
that

4056.48 --> 4061.079
i'm not believing it for a second though

4081.039 --> 4085.3590000000004
all right magicians like it like oh

4083.68 --> 4087.9199999999996
magician

4085.359 --> 4091.64
turn him to stone oh really how

4087.92 --> 4091.64
how did he do that

4096.88 --> 4102.0
and by the way like how is that

4099.759 --> 4105.839
before they were turned to zone how did

4102.0 --> 4105.839
they even build huge cities

4110.239 --> 4114.5199999999995
sounds more like a cover story

4119.44 --> 4123.12
i mean maybe

4120.96 --> 4126.719
that's the story that came out of it to

4123.12 --> 4130.239
kind of cover for a similar situation as

4126.719 --> 4131.759
oh pyramids in egypt

4130.239 --> 4135.839
right i think that

4131.759 --> 4139.759
china was just as much of the

4135.839 --> 4142.5599999999995
the atlantean age as everybody else

4139.759 --> 4144.64
they just made up the terracotta thing

4142.56 --> 4148.719
the terracotta army

4144.64 --> 4148.719
just to cover for it in legend

4150.719 --> 4155.279
i think it's much more likely that

4152.64 --> 4157.4400000000005
giants were involved

4155.279 --> 4160.4400000000005
and stone costing techniques and all

4157.44 --> 4160.44
that

4167.199 --> 4172.3589999999995
the confucius was said to come from

4169.359 --> 4172.359
whatever

4174.88 --> 4178.679
that's that's funny

4189.52 --> 4192.52
uh

4205.12 --> 4210.4
the egyptian magicians migrated to china

4208.719 --> 4212.4
what

4210.4 --> 4215.4
ever considered that they were just

4212.4 --> 4215.4
everywhere

4222.64 --> 4227.280000000001
right and like it's not the egyptian

4225.12 --> 4230.5599999999995
magicians by the way the egyptians

4227.28 --> 4234.0
didn't build the pyramids

4230.56 --> 4237.679
they settled in after the flood

4234.0 --> 4241.199
pyramids were all before the flood

4237.679 --> 4243.92
but it could be there was a big team

4241.199 --> 4246.48
like with giants and a whole bunch of

4243.92 --> 4249.36
wizards that had a lot of knowledge

4246.48 --> 4251.5199999999995
about stone casting and all that

4249.36 --> 4253.759999999999
and that they did kind of like go around

4251.52 --> 4256.2390000000005
like building teams building these

4253.76 --> 4258.56
hydroelectric generators we know now as

4256.239 --> 4261.12
pyramids everywhere

4258.56 --> 4263.4400000000005
and settlements and everything

4261.12 --> 4266.32
probably went around the world and just

4263.44 --> 4266.32
kept doing that

4268.719 --> 4272.92
right and that's before the flood

4275.679 --> 4281.52
china means middle it does

4279.76 --> 4285.08
huh

4281.52 --> 4285.080000000001
never heard of that

4307.76 --> 4310.76
do

4318.719 --> 4323.88
hmm fascinating slow mo moon buggy

4333.679 --> 4338.719
they built one pyramid perhaps they used

4335.76 --> 4342.56
its generating power to build others

4338.719 --> 4345.76
that's not very logical

4342.56 --> 4346.64
but they did use it probably to charge

4345.76 --> 4351.04
things

4346.64 --> 4351.04
things like batteries heal people

4351.199 --> 4356.159
all kinds of things that

4353.44 --> 4358.159
pyramids could be used for but mostly

4356.159 --> 4361.04
charging devices

4358.159 --> 4364.08
devices that they probably use

4361.04 --> 4366.64
in all kinds of ways

4364.08 --> 4368.64
but yeah you can't you can bring the

4366.64 --> 4370.719
charged equipment with you you can't

4368.64 --> 4372.64
bring the the pyramid

4370.719 --> 4375.76
field electric fields coming from a

4372.64 --> 4377.12
pyramid don't reach forever

4375.76 --> 4379.280000000001
right

4377.12 --> 4379.28
so

4379.76 --> 4385.08
why are pyramids on the dollar that's

4381.679 --> 4385.08
because of freemasonry

4387.76 --> 4390.96
it's because the freemason

4389.6 --> 4393.84
just like to

4390.96 --> 4396.719
tell everybody we know how that was done

4393.84 --> 4399.4400000000005
we're not telling you

4396.719 --> 4403.12
we have stone casting techniques

4399.44 --> 4403.12
we know how to do this [ __ ]

4403.36 --> 4406.96
we're not gonna tell you but we are

4405.12 --> 4409.96
gonna shove it in your face

4406.96 --> 4409.96
constantly

4418.239 --> 4423.5199999999995
ah perhaps the egyptians migrated to

4421.44 --> 4426.08
america huh well

4423.52 --> 4429.84
there's a certain religion that likes to

4426.08 --> 4429.84
suggest that definitely

4430.88 --> 4433.6
mormonism

4434.32 --> 4441.92
it's really interesting like that

4437.84 --> 4444.88
they suggest that yeah like jesus might

4441.92 --> 4447.04
have even visited

4444.88 --> 4448.719
or something like that this is the whole

4447.04 --> 4452.12
thing about it

4448.719 --> 4452.12
about the americas

4476.96 --> 4480.92
right but yeah dd999

4481.44 --> 4484.48
the pyramid

4483.44 --> 4487.759999999999
look

4484.48 --> 4490.5599999999995
we don't exactly know what type of

4487.76 --> 4493.52
things exactly in the

4490.56 --> 4495.1990000000005
pre-flood era was available

4493.52 --> 4498.64
there's a good chance they might have

4495.199 --> 4499.759999999999
had like flying cities

4498.64 --> 4501.92
yeah

4499.76 --> 4504.159000000001
big ones i made a drawing of that by the

4501.92 --> 4504.159
way

4504.64 --> 4510.400000000001
i want to show you now

4507.12 --> 4511.5199999999995
i made it quite some time ago

4510.4 --> 4514.239
so

4511.52 --> 4516.719
yeah build a pyramid

4514.239 --> 4519.5199999999995
charge

4516.719 --> 4522.4800000000005
char yeah get it work get it

4519.52 --> 4526.2390000000005
turned on and then yeah perhaps

4522.48 --> 4528.32
even charge your floating city with it

4526.239 --> 4530.4
so you could literally move on to the

4528.32 --> 4533.599999999999
next location

4530.4 --> 4533.599999999999
and build it again

4535.92 --> 4539.84
let's see where is it

4558.8 --> 4562.400000000001
damn it we're gonna put that

4565.28 --> 4568.32
yeah there it is

4568.56 --> 4573.360000000001
it's a very s

4571.12 --> 4575.44
it's a pencil drawing you can barely see

4573.36 --> 4578.839999999999
it probably when i show it but it'll

4575.44 --> 4578.839999999999
have to do

4585.199 --> 4589.4
right there we go

4598.0 --> 4601.36
flying

4599.199 --> 4604.36
city's good house the homeless that's

4601.36 --> 4604.36
hilarious

4615.36 --> 4620.4
well it it was more of a flying fortress

4618.48 --> 4623.44
like that

4620.4 --> 4625.759999999999
probably could well ha could just zap

4623.44 --> 4625.759999999999
[ __ ]

4626.44 --> 4631.5199999999995
disintegration or

4628.4 --> 4634.08
super heavy electric

4631.52 --> 4637.080000000001
tesla coil like

4634.08 --> 4637.08
discharges

4637.76 --> 4641.04
right there's

4639.76 --> 4644.320000000001
this

4641.04 --> 4646.56
there's these legends in the

4644.32 --> 4648.96
uh the hindu religion

4646.56 --> 4650.719
describe the the the wars between the

4648.96 --> 4654.719
flying cities and their well what they

4650.719 --> 4654.719
said were nukes and death rays

4656.64 --> 4660.159000000001
that's

4657.52 --> 4662.400000000001
yeah that fits right into my atlantean

4660.159 --> 4662.4
age

4663.28 --> 4669.88
setup

4665.52 --> 4669.88
you could just put it right in there

4690.0 --> 4696.0
yeah yeah by the way hello son ho it's

4693.04 --> 4697.92
i've never seen you in my chat before

4696.0 --> 4699.199
but uh yeah good

4697.92 --> 4703.96
interesting

4699.199 --> 4703.96
topics you're bringing thanks for that

4712.159 --> 4716.799999999999
wow my show it's been going

4714.8 --> 4720.04
i feel quite good actually

4716.8 --> 4720.04
right now

4758.64 --> 4763.4800000000005
yes yes warner i know

4765.04 --> 4769.84
look i'm not saying that i think that

4767.76 --> 4772.08
like

4769.84 --> 4774.2390000000005
it's all perfect

4772.08 --> 4775.76
right with mormonism and all that

4774.239 --> 4778.5599999999995
there's issues

4775.76 --> 4779.679
i just think that their entire angle of

4778.56 --> 4782.159000000001
approach

4779.679 --> 4784.719
talking about

4782.159 --> 4788.08
the ancient times and america i think

4784.719 --> 4791.44
that part is really fascinating

4788.08 --> 4794.32
right because officially

4791.44 --> 4795.919999999999
even right now in the official history

4794.32 --> 4798.88
right we talked about it

4795.92 --> 4798.88
earlier at the show

4799.12 --> 4804.88
it's not recognized to even have been

4801.92 --> 4808.159
colonized it's just the wild indians

4804.88 --> 4809.36
were supposedly in america that's it

4808.159 --> 4811.04
that was the only thing that was

4809.36 --> 4813.28
supposed to be there

4811.04 --> 4815.679
right despite all the

4813.28 --> 4818.239
architecture

4815.679 --> 4819.92
this just inherited like nobody could

4818.239 --> 4822.32
ever build that just like that so

4819.92 --> 4822.32
quickly

4822.48 --> 4829.678999999999
like not the locals at at least

4826.4 --> 4832.719
right so there is just and

4829.679 --> 4834.96
yeah the mormons the

4832.719 --> 4837.04
book of mormon

4834.96 --> 4839.92
it addresses that going to america in

4837.04 --> 4841.92
the ancient times and i find that

4839.92 --> 4844.96
very fascinating

4841.92 --> 4847.04
just as a as a loose concept that they

4844.96 --> 4848.639
forwarded that

4847.04 --> 4849.76
because

4848.639 --> 4851.28
that's

4849.76 --> 4853.84
not addressed

4851.28 --> 4855.759999999999
in history

4853.84 --> 4859.400000000001
and they it might there might have been

4855.76 --> 4859.400000000001
something to it

4868.32 --> 4872.159
the bible doesn't mention america well

4870.32 --> 4874.96
marky wise

4872.159 --> 4876.4
it look considering when the book's

4874.96 --> 4879.52
written

4876.4 --> 4880.799999999999
it wouldn't have been called america

4879.52 --> 4884.040000000001
even

4880.8 --> 4884.04
back then

4888.159 --> 4893.839999999999
right in a way it became america after

4891.199 --> 4894.799999999999
the mud flood era

4893.84 --> 4896.8
which

4894.8 --> 4898.400000000001
is suspected to have happened somewhere

4896.8 --> 4902.04
in the

4898.4 --> 4902.04
18th century

4918.56 --> 4922.2390000000005
made up for that what

4926.88 --> 4932.1990000000005
yeah mate

4928.32 --> 4932.199
is spelled with d-m-a-d-e

4932.48 --> 4936.5199999999995
maid is a woman

4947.679 --> 4951.08
oh yeah

4981.6 --> 4987.6
right i'm gonna round out the show

4984.32 --> 4989.92
that's interesting

4987.6 --> 4992.400000000001
just like to dig through like his

4989.92 --> 4994.88
history again and try to reconstruct it

4992.4 --> 4994.879999999999
somehow

4996.32 --> 5001.759999999999
it doesn't stress me out as

4998.96 --> 5004.08
other subjects

5001.76 --> 5006.96
right

5004.08 --> 5009.36
anyway thanks everyone for coming i hope
