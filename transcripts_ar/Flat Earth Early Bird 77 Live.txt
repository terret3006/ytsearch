4.19 --> 11.879000000000001
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

8.61 --> 16.25
early-bird number 77 I'm your host

11.879 --> 20.21
Arwen and today it's still cold but

16.25 --> 24.3
seems to be dying down a bit because

20.21 --> 27.740000000000002
waiting a bit so the slow the snow is

24.3 --> 27.740000000000002
slowly retracting

34.78 --> 40.57
that's still snowy it's funny like

37.69 --> 44.29
there's been a big scuffle the birds

40.57 --> 48.72
over there for a food that I dropped and

44.29 --> 53.25
now they left all these these marks

48.72 --> 53.25
these paw marks in the snow

54.48 --> 64.1
yeah fortunately I can't put the camera

58.71 --> 64.1
closer or yeah oh well

68.619 --> 75.869
I have so many things to talk about but

71.35 --> 79.24
I have to get them back in my head first

75.869 --> 81.189
every time before the show starts or

79.24 --> 83.259
usually before the show starts there's

81.189 --> 86.58999999999999
like a water full of information just

83.259 --> 89.5
coming over me like oh wow this and that

86.59 --> 94.479
and this and that but I don't have it

89.5 --> 96.49
like a note on me when I do that usually

94.479 --> 100.329
like on the bike or whatever so I have

96.49 --> 103.04899999999999
to just let it slip in my mind back

100.329 --> 103.04899999999999
naturally

104.97 --> 111.61
so it seems by the way that nathan is

109.03 --> 115.509
doing something again live not sure

111.61 --> 116.52
about it's a hangout link so I don't

115.509 --> 119.11
know what he's doing

116.52 --> 123.72
but I'm just doing my flat earther early

119.11 --> 128.019
bird show and figure out what he's doing

123.72 --> 131.069
soon enough so let's see who is in chat

128.019 --> 131.06900000000002
lots of people

132.41 --> 149.98
Nik Daniel fields X Steve

137.38 --> 153.68
JJ is McLeod a GM I don't throw the UK

149.98 --> 163.42999999999998
Obama kool Kris Matt good morning

153.68 --> 166.46
everyone thank so many hang out

163.43 --> 168.38
yesterday it's like still watching one

166.46 --> 171.44
and then another one would pop up and

168.38 --> 174.79999999999998
then halfway that another one would pop

171.44 --> 176.72
up and another one it's like kept on

174.8 --> 179.68
going until the middle of the night for

176.72 --> 187.12
me just kept on going

179.68 --> 187.12
it's crazy and yeah

187.28 --> 192.95
so many things happening in the world

189.62 --> 194.03
the whole Venice away last situation and

192.95 --> 199.60999999999999
what is that

194.03 --> 204.29
so can look it from so many different

199.61 --> 209.24
angles it's just even to me is little

204.29 --> 211.60999999999999
overwhelming just seems to be happening

209.24 --> 214.73000000000002
now pretty fast but there's like a lot

211.61 --> 216.95000000000002
of information to be catching up on as

214.73 --> 220.26999999999998
to what is really taking place there and

216.95 --> 230.86999999999998
called trolled opposition system and

220.27 --> 234.38
markets ideologies but it seems like the

230.87 --> 236.95000000000002
whole Vanessa whele thing they were

234.38 --> 236.95
under

237.8 --> 241.42000000000002
basically being

243.64 --> 249.52999999999997
sorry I I don't know why I'm not getting

246.29 --> 256.73
my words through there were being

249.53 --> 260.08
sanctioned and yeah and their elite made

256.73 --> 260.08000000000004
a mess of things really

261.13 --> 269.36
it's so weird almost because they did

264.94 --> 271.46
definitely have an opportunity to to

269.36 --> 277.22
make something good out of it and they

271.46 --> 278.04999999999995
didn't really barely not enough and now

277.22 --> 281.03000000000003
yeah

278.05 --> 283.64
friction is on and the revolution

281.03 --> 289.30999999999995
apparently and everybody's getting all

283.64 --> 292.07
ruckus stuff over over this thing over

289.31 --> 294.58
this self-declared new president over

292.07 --> 298.15999999999997
there and Trump is supporting him and

294.58 --> 301.52
like Russia and China and everybody else

298.16 --> 307.52000000000004
is like good but good America is

301.52 --> 310.49
interfering again oh yeah it is but they

307.52 --> 314.34999999999997
were interfering there before that too

310.49 --> 317.18
with this government with basically

314.35 --> 320.03000000000003
helping it to form the way it is so how

317.18 --> 324.58
yeah it's almost like the whole Iraq

320.03 --> 324.58
Saddam Hussein thing over and over again

325.32 --> 329.34999999999997
yeah they are interfering but they were

327.55 --> 333.43
interfering and now they're just doing

329.35 --> 335.64000000000004
it again that's kind of how I see it at

333.43 --> 335.64
this moment

340.28 --> 349.15999999999997
makes it very hard to give a sensible

345.35 --> 352.36
judgment if it is wrong or if it is

349.16 --> 355.67
right makes it much more complex to me

352.36 --> 359.65000000000003
anyway that's going on and then of

355.67 --> 363.89000000000004
course Martin let cos hang out yesterday

359.65 --> 370.21
another tartarean chapter more details

363.89 --> 370.21
and yeah that English written

371.9 --> 378.41999999999996
description like a historical record the

375.15 --> 381.41999999999996
description of what they were doing how

378.42 --> 385.68
they conducted their affairs internally

381.42 --> 389.28000000000003
totally fascinating and it again made me

385.68 --> 391.65000000000003
think like my god the whole Tartarian

389.28 --> 395.03999999999996
issue it is so complex it is so

391.65 --> 398.0
elaborate is such a long history and I

395.04 --> 401.85
felt that Martin shared was basically

398.0 --> 406.86
like the latter part of what the tart

401.85 --> 409.5
Aryans became it's not the frolicking

406.86 --> 415.5
people really that that seems to be like

409.5 --> 419.57
the earlier starts where that came from

415.5 --> 421.89
it's it is so fast and complex it's just

419.57 --> 427.46999999999997
makes me think and I was really

421.89 --> 433.2
surprised seeing that well that they

427.47 --> 437.55
were supposedly the the start the

433.2 --> 440.52
purveyors of of the Orthodox Christian

437.55 --> 444.15000000000003
Church and that they had also

440.52 --> 447.12
connections with with Islam or so

444.15 --> 451.97999999999996
suggested there may be some of the same

447.12 --> 454.77
roots as what sprung Islam man it is so

451.98 --> 457.11
complex you can't just say oh look I

454.77 --> 462.95
recognized a symbol so it must be this

457.11 --> 467.7
entire thing that we know now have the

462.95 --> 470.49
very happy to me and again every time I

467.7 --> 474.15
think it's so typical every time I think

470.49 --> 476.88
oh my god needs no puzzle piece and now

474.15 --> 479.54999999999995
it looks like this the whole thing looks

476.88 --> 484.65
like this but yeah yet another part

479.55 --> 486.33
comes in and it's like votes no even

484.65 --> 489.85999999999996
though it made sense it was still

486.33 --> 489.85999999999996
somewhat of an oversimplification

490.02 --> 501.96999999999997
everything is in reality is so compact

493.6 --> 507.12
and complex just difficult difficult to

501.97 --> 507.12
really understand takes a lifetime maybe

508.5 --> 514.479
but yeah it's more to be figured out

511.65 --> 517.3299999999999
concerning the tart Aryans what was that

514.479 --> 521.83
where did they come from there's a

517.33 --> 526.12
obviously the north the North Asian

521.83 --> 529.089
Empire aspect with the clear settlements

526.12 --> 532.779
that he later empires how they conducted

529.089 --> 537.8800000000001
themselves and where did they come from

532.779 --> 544.96
how did they come into being how were

537.88 --> 548.56
they related to these polity people

544.96 --> 550.77
are they actually the same or are they

548.56 --> 550.77
like

552.21 --> 561.6
a merger are the later Tartarian a

554.94 --> 568.5290000000001
merger between the old frolic II white

561.6 --> 572.399
tartarean of people and a more as we see

568.529 --> 576.63
it now you human like more like we're

572.399 --> 579.06
now a human race in Europe that was

576.63 --> 584.58
similar and they merged or something I

579.06 --> 590.3299999999999
don't know it's and again we got also

584.58 --> 594.0
got to see a lot of pictures that that

590.33 --> 594.6600000000001
that religion that pops up with these

594.0 --> 599.79
images

594.66 --> 604.399
every time the looks very satanic this

599.79 --> 608.04
as as what we now think is satanic

604.399 --> 610.89
format type God or Bale or whatever that

608.04 --> 615.06
was very grim very dark and always

610.89 --> 618.9
bloody thing surrounding it and we're

615.06 --> 624.26
thinking like yeah was that really the

618.9 --> 624.26
god of of those people

625.63 --> 632.709
I I don't think so it doesn't feel the

630.579 --> 638.1899999999999
same it doesn't have the same frequency

632.709 --> 638.1899999999999
so was it really their God or was it

638.25 --> 645.279
well like the Jesuits or whatever the

641.23 --> 650.139
Jesuits turned into now was it their

645.279 --> 654.819
ancestors that basically gave the tart

650.139 --> 657.569
Aryans this God like handed it to them

654.819 --> 666.639
like here this is so amazing

657.569 --> 670.75
take it and just let ya let go let go of

666.639 --> 673.9300000000001
all limitedness and all that and drive

670.75 --> 678.79
yourself nuts and that is the trick it's

673.93 --> 681.6389999999999
like planting that spiritual dark seed

678.79 --> 686.319
and then if the people don't outright

681.639 --> 689.38
reject it they're even able to then that

686.319 --> 692.79
seed will grow inside them and distort

689.38 --> 697.42
what they were turn them into freaky

692.79 --> 699.37
demon-possessed beasts is that what it

697.42 --> 704.13
was I'm starting to think more that this

699.37 --> 706.3
God is just being exported like an evil

704.13 --> 711.17
self-destructive religion that is being

706.3 --> 716.959
exported - yeah

711.17 --> 720.679
to other cultures too to derail them so

716.959 --> 722.54
that they do become barbarians and the

720.679 --> 725.0889999999999
Europeans I'll just call them have an

722.54 --> 729.379
excuse to take them over because yeah

725.089 --> 732.139
look they are savages now yeah okay this

729.379 --> 734.929
is much less objection than actually

732.139 --> 739.6
going to war with a advanced spiritual

734.929 --> 739.6
people that is very wise you know so

744.9 --> 751.41
yeah and it makes sense to me because

748.49 --> 754.52
yeah that's what they do that's even

751.41 --> 754.52
what they do in this time

761.7 --> 767.1500000000001
they present this this is anti-god

767.69 --> 775.0100000000001
to anyone I say like oh yeah this is

770.03 --> 777.56
great you can be part of this while what

775.01 --> 779.27
they're not telling you or what they may

777.56 --> 782.15
actually tell you but you just do not

779.27 --> 788.42
get it at the time or you're too blinded

782.15 --> 791.3199999999999
by all the glory they use that it's not

788.42 --> 796.3299999999999
actually your God you are the sacrifice

791.32 --> 796.33
for them as you take on this God

799.94 --> 813.8000000000001
it is quite the devil's trick really

804.34 --> 815.6600000000001
very systematic heavy stuff anyway I am

813.8 --> 819.3499999999999
open for guests I already put out the

815.66 --> 824.36
link in the in Skype so anyone willing

819.35 --> 827.36
to join you can do it through the

824.36 --> 830.78
letters early bird chat and I also had a

827.36 --> 833.36
couple of people contacting me on skype

830.78 --> 834.7099999999999
a couple of new people that studio know

833.36 --> 838.19
what I'll give you a link I don't know

834.71 --> 840.64
if you're there so I've seen you plenty

838.19 --> 840.6400000000001
of times

841.79 --> 847.63
I saw the guy get in the link and see

864.74 --> 871.33
so yeah and a few links we'll see who is

867.62 --> 871.33
coming no idea

881.4 --> 884.0
yes

913.66 --> 916.66
works

921.43 --> 927.16
yeah

923.08 --> 931.779
you know you don't get bad things away

927.16 --> 933.8199999999999
by saying ohm that really only works in

931.779 --> 936.1
the heat of the moment like if people

933.82 --> 940.48
get really freaking angry then it may

936.1 --> 942.9590000000001
help to soothe them but yeah that seed

940.48 --> 946.9590000000001
in people that is just luring out there

942.959 --> 950.8199999999999
trying to be silly and the railing

946.959 --> 950.8199999999999
you're not gonna get it away with an ohm

961.23 --> 967.529
reach them first you figure out their

964.72 --> 971.19
puzzle for them that they hide behind

967.529 --> 971.1899999999999
before you can do that

1000.38 --> 1009.38
no ace not mandala effects transition is

1006.15 --> 1009.38
clearly recorded

1013.9 --> 1015.93
Oh

1020.63 --> 1025.78
the sound of the universe just sound

1027.34 --> 1034.9299999999998
saying the word ohm even creates a very

1030.52 --> 1037.47
distinct vibration type tenements you

1034.93 --> 1037.47
can feel it

1041.63 --> 1048.169
[Music]

1043.299 --> 1051.32
so weird like this slight rain going on

1048.169 --> 1054.169
just everything feels different the air

1051.32 --> 1055.999
feels different I feel different

1054.169 --> 1058.5800000000002
I just feel completely different as I

1055.999 --> 1061.22
did yesterday not still the same person

1058.58 --> 1065.72
it's just that the way the energies work

1061.22 --> 1068.23
are just different and having trouble

1065.72 --> 1075.169
finding like in a flow

1068.23 --> 1077.44
you must be noticing this try to get

1075.169 --> 1077.44
back

1081.55 --> 1084.54
but yeah

1086.57 --> 1092.0
they also have something to do with all

1088.94 --> 1097.0700000000002
this confrontation all these details

1092.0 --> 1100.43
these new details that just make things

1097.07 --> 1102.08
not so straightforward clear again they

1100.43 --> 1105.71
make it a little bit more complex it

1102.08 --> 1108.82
seems so maybe I'm just in a puzzled

1105.71 --> 1108.82
mood or something

1113.08 --> 1118.71
the average I am kind of inspired but I

1116.35 --> 1118.7099999999998
just

1121.59 --> 1127.55
it seems like all this inspiration needs

1124.02 --> 1127.55
to settle a little first

1135.73 --> 1139.3600000000001
but yeah come on come on people get on

1138.61 --> 1143.9699999999998
my panel

1139.36 --> 1143.9699999999998
I need a guest

1148.359 --> 1152.32
you guys aren't gonna join I'm good just

1150.159 --> 1154.659
gonna start Skype calling you okay it's

1152.32 --> 1158.489
like yeah you're on the flat earth early

1154.659 --> 1158.489
where Joe now talk to me

1189.66 --> 1195.66
also I'm maybe a little pretty

1193.049 --> 1199.8899999999999
distracted cuz tonight his gaming night

1195.66 --> 1203.0700000000002
again and I'm a little things a little

1199.89 --> 1205.65
comb more complex for myself by

1203.07 --> 1208.35
postponing writing the standard story

1205.65 --> 1211.23
that I have to finish record before the

1208.35 --> 1214.23
session starts it's not that difficult

1211.23 --> 1216.48
just have to get to that I have to get

1214.23 --> 1220.16
to it before this so I have to do it

1216.48 --> 1223.35
somewhere within the next four hours and

1220.16 --> 1225.419
it'll work out but also like made dinner

1223.35 --> 1227.82
a little bit more complex for myself so

1225.419 --> 1230.3700000000001
I have to I'm slightly preoccupied like

1227.82 --> 1233.809
oh yeah I have to time all that right or

1230.37 --> 1233.809
then there's gonna be a mess for me

1236.69 --> 1241.04
looking forward to that doing that

1251.25 --> 1258.15
all right send their age oh god yeah

1254.25 --> 1261.0
here another freakin subject okay for

1258.15 --> 1264.179
anyone that hasn't taken note ranty flat

1261.0 --> 1269.99
earth had a premiere yesterday where he

1264.179 --> 1275.909
had a guy on with a presentation about

1269.99 --> 1279.299
optics that is the most condensed heavy

1275.909 --> 1283.98
detailed up technical object optics

1279.299 --> 1286.26
research that I've ever seen and like I

1283.98 --> 1289.22
realized it but it was even too much

1286.26 --> 1293.82
information it was too much detail but

1289.22 --> 1300.53
the guy get very very elaborate and

1293.82 --> 1307.46
detailed explanation and arguments for a

1300.53 --> 1310.26
standard upward refraction due to the

1307.46 --> 1313.44
different air layers and how they

1310.26 --> 1320.039
function in relation to their density

1313.44 --> 1323.3700000000001
and to their temperature and it was so

1320.039 --> 1324.179
detailed just it's like very very

1323.37 --> 1328.2299999999998
compelling

1324.179 --> 1331.5590000000002
at first glance at least like wow it is

1328.23 --> 1333.8700000000001
such a complete picture what what we

1331.559 --> 1336.3899999999999
were presented with that yeah maybe that

1333.87 --> 1342.79
is what that is and it it does kind of

1336.39 --> 1345.5
conform to an optical slant light

1342.79 --> 1349.97
bending upwards depending on the layer

1345.5 --> 1353.0
and yeah that would naturally distort

1349.97 --> 1356.54
things too cause they all had optical

1353.0 --> 1359.559
slant effect pretty much so yeah there

1356.54 --> 1364.4289999999999
was a technical background worked out

1359.559 --> 1369.1299999999999
system for it somebody did that somebody

1364.429 --> 1372.47
figure that out incredible so yet

1369.13 --> 1374.5700000000002
absolutely if you haven't then go to

1372.47 --> 1377.799
Randy flutter it's channel after this

1374.57 --> 1382.73
and take a look at that last video

1377.799 --> 1388.58
upload that he did because it's it is so

1382.73 --> 1391.7
much data so much new data like the

1388.58 --> 1394.52
things that we did in the Flat Earth

1391.7 --> 1397.01
debates all together in the last year

1394.52 --> 1399.11
half a year there was a lot of

1397.01 --> 1401.96
development but it was slowly and it was

1399.11 --> 1403.7299999999998
in public like moments of realization

1401.96 --> 1406.299
and putting it all together slowly while

1403.73 --> 1409.13
this guy I don't know where he got this

1406.299 --> 1413.3899999999999
he's that smart Oh feet or if he has

1409.13 --> 1415.72
just these amazing sources because it is

1413.39 --> 1415.72
like

1417.09 --> 1422.3999999999999
the whole thing that we did but just in

1420.24 --> 1423.84
that one presentation so I don't know

1422.4 --> 1426.9
how long he's been working on it but

1423.84 --> 1433.6399999999999
it's so detailed so well worked out so

1426.9 --> 1438.2
much craftsmanship in it so much work

1433.64 --> 1440.64
must have went into figuring it out and

1438.2 --> 1444.51
recording it and doing the measurements

1440.64 --> 1446.7800000000002
and all that it's just poof impressive

1444.51 --> 1446.78
stuff

1463.07 --> 1470.8999999999999
right okay I am seeing a neutral trend

1466.79 --> 1474.02
so everybody's gonna make jokes and

1470.9 --> 1477.3300000000002
obsess over my healer and it's so funny

1474.02 --> 1484.43
and I guess I'm just gonna have to nip

1477.33 --> 1484.4299999999998
this one in the bud don't really care

1485.34 --> 1489.4399999999998
just slain

1492.77 --> 1498.44
and not everyone revolves everything I

1496.13 --> 1505.3700000000001
do doesn't revolve around this guy he's

1498.44 --> 1511.3600000000001
just someone that guides me in places

1505.37 --> 1515.9899999999998
where I feel that I have weaknesses and

1511.36 --> 1521.0
yeah I wish I had known him ten years

1515.99 --> 1524.179
ago or even before although yeah again I

1521.0 --> 1526.7
might have actually have met these type

1524.179 --> 1531.74
of people back then but I just couldn't

1526.7 --> 1533.99
get I resisted like like no I'm not

1531.74 --> 1540.49
ready yet I have to do what I'm doing

1533.99 --> 1540.49
right now for some mystical reason so

1541.45 --> 1548.51
it's all a matter of timing in that

1544.16 --> 1550.76
sense like people can talk to you the

1548.51 --> 1552.59
absolute truth with great wisdom all

1550.76 --> 1554.47
your life from the start and there's

1552.59 --> 1559.28
such a big chance for many people that

1554.47 --> 1561.38
as you grow up you just don't take the

1559.28 --> 1565.49
advice you don't take your parents

1561.38 --> 1569.2700000000002
advice you don't take families your

1565.49 --> 1572.27
teachers advice you don't know I want to

1569.27 --> 1574.55
do it my way you don't even know why you

1572.27 --> 1577.76
just have this feeling when that happens

1574.55 --> 1580.61
and then later you figure it out like oh

1577.76 --> 1583.72
[ __ ] yeah they were damn right why did I

1580.61 --> 1587.99
feel so compelled to do this and yeah

1583.72 --> 1590.09
most people hopefully you realize yeah

1587.99 --> 1592.76
it kind of did confront me with the

1590.09 --> 1594.83
actual thing and the actual thing going

1592.76 --> 1598.429
through it instead of hearing about it

1594.83 --> 1602.03
gives another depth to it gives another

1598.429 --> 1604.3090000000002
value to it and apparently as kids you

1602.03 --> 1606.35
know this intuitively so that's just

1604.309 --> 1612.35
amazing that it works that way but does

1606.35 --> 1615.83
explain why kids by youngers just refuse

1612.35 --> 1618.4099999999999
to listen to wisdom and they don't get

1615.83 --> 1619.6999999999998
it or they don't want to get it just

1618.41 --> 1622.519
reject

1619.7 --> 1626.019
and then later on it's like oh yeah yeah

1622.519 --> 1626.019
I get it now okay

1629.809 --> 1637.749
and I'll bet you there are many healers

1633.289 --> 1637.749
in the world on many levels

1637.929 --> 1645.039
feeling doing that it's not that complex

1646.46 --> 1656.1100000000001
it's basically a few steps away from

1650.299 --> 1660.59
just a regular common sense psychologist

1656.11 --> 1664.9399999999998
except they take another angle to it and

1660.59 --> 1668.47
this either guy obviously has a more

1664.94 --> 1668.47
spiritual angle to it

1670.34 --> 1675.53
but it is kind of doing the same thing

1672.8 --> 1678.02
so I bet there are just many heroes out

1675.53 --> 1681.5
there just not all of them will be this

1678.02 --> 1688.16
is wise with the spiritual like a lot of

1681.5 --> 1690.86
people that they like from the kids

1688.16 --> 1694.16
perspective again they try to figure out

1690.86 --> 1697.34
spirit to stuff themselves and they are

1694.16 --> 1700.8500000000001
seduced also by opposing other factions

1697.34 --> 1705.35
look so many people like from where I

1700.85 --> 1708.86
come from go into the Gothic sea or

1705.35 --> 1711.59
become anti-christian and then like oh

1708.86 --> 1714.4599999999998
yeah I'll go with the devil guy because

1711.59 --> 1718.61
at least he is not a Christian thing

1714.46 --> 1721.1000000000001
because of the bad aspects that are

1718.61 --> 1724.6399999999999
still part of that religion that are

1721.1 --> 1728.12
very obvious an overlooked and they're

1724.64 --> 1733.48
blind to it all that so yeah that's the

1728.12 --> 1736.25
reason how you come from that angle but

1733.48 --> 1742.15
that doesn't necessarily mean that you

1736.25 --> 1745.52
will be smart too or knowledgeable about

1742.15 --> 1748.6000000000001
what you've joined again and how that

1745.52 --> 1748.6
works and did

1749.64 --> 1756.42
most people will totally underestimate

1752.309 --> 1763.29
that and how dark some of these people

1756.42 --> 1765.15
are again just so yeah there may be many

1763.29 --> 1768.12
healers out there and some of them will

1765.15 --> 1771.8400000000001
do some good but yeah the rule also be

1768.12 --> 1775.7399999999998
many of them that are misled and that

1771.84 --> 1779.07
can do actual healing but will also be

1775.74 --> 1781.11
susceptible and vulnerable to demonic

1779.07 --> 1784.1689999999999
influences themselves they will have

1781.11 --> 1791.9289999999999
like serious ego problems that enact out

1784.169 --> 1796.679
kind of thing and a really good healer

1791.929 --> 1799.13
works on that almost before anything

1796.679 --> 1801.3600000000001
else because you start with yourself

1799.13 --> 1803.73
can't love another if you can't love

1801.36 --> 1807.27
yourself you can't heal another properly

1803.73 --> 1812.21
if you can't heal yourself that's yeah

1807.27 --> 1812.21
it's such a basic wisdom but

1812.68 --> 1819.6100000000001
not everybody basic wisdom seems to be

1816.31 --> 1825.4299999999998
very complicated for a whole bunch of

1819.61 --> 1829.99
people in this world so and everybody

1825.43 --> 1834.4
can repeat the truth say it but actually

1829.99 --> 1837.88
doing it themselves not necessarily in a

1834.4 --> 1840.67
depth in a demonstrative way but just

1837.88 --> 1847.3000000000002
doing it for real in themselves for real

1840.67 --> 1848.98
that's a different matter in reality

1847.3 --> 1854.35
things can turn out to be a little bit

1848.98 --> 1859.84
more complicated when you actually do it

1854.35 --> 1864.57
then as it is spoken about anyway

1859.84 --> 1864.57
getting very meta at this moment yeah

1864.6 --> 1873.37
but yeah there will be many healers out

1867.07 --> 1875.1699999999998
there and yeah you can be one too you

1873.37 --> 1878.4099999999999
know there are many blessings that come

1875.17 --> 1882.1000000000001
with the path they talked about it

1878.41 --> 1885.76
before if you walk the path you will be

1882.1 --> 1889.48
fighting the darkness a lot more than if

1885.76 --> 1891.19
you don't but if you don't then you

1889.48 --> 1894.22
become part of that darkness and that

1891.19 --> 1899.98
darkness plays with you makes you into

1894.22 --> 1902.92
its palm so there's that and the grim

1899.98 --> 1906.01
feel that that gives but what is not so

1902.92 --> 1909.5800000000002
obvious is when you walk the path you

1906.01 --> 1913.02
will be handed down divine tools from

1909.58 --> 1917.74
within the light they come naturally and

1913.02 --> 1920.83
healing real

1917.74 --> 1924.24
deep spiritual healing is part of that

1920.83 --> 1927.01
and the deeper you walk into the light

1924.24 --> 1930.25
the narrower you walk the path the

1927.01 --> 1934.529
stronger this effect this healing effect

1930.25 --> 1934.529
is radiance can become

1948.33 --> 1951.8
yeah Daniel feel this

1952.15 --> 1957.97
now there so there's a yeah something

1955.0 --> 1959.74
that rings very true Lucifer is the

1957.97 --> 1961.99
origin the starting point and the

1959.74 --> 1963.84
driving power of the wrong principles

1961.99 --> 1967.81
yeah it is

1963.84 --> 1970.6599999999999
like no I know better we can do it

1967.81 --> 1974.94
differently it can still be great why

1970.66 --> 1978.94
can't why he has it yep

1974.94 --> 1981.3700000000001
why has the path have to be the best way

1978.94 --> 1983.23
that's basically Lucifer that's why he

1981.37 --> 1988.33
wants you off there and he offers you

1983.23 --> 1991.8700000000001
alternatives in E or QD v ations that'll

1988.33 --> 1997.9299999999998
be just as attractive or even more but

1991.87 --> 2004.11
not have the same durable light based

1997.93 --> 2008.3100000000002
nature it's it it becomes sacrificial

2004.11 --> 2012.3899999999999
chaotic it is fed into the essence of

2008.31 --> 2017.54
that direction that Lucifer suggests you

2012.39 --> 2017.5400000000002
to take that's the difference

2029.74 --> 2039.99
no was my healer is not a flat earther

2033.27 --> 2039.99
I've actually tried to do it but

2042.75 --> 2053.13
I don't know why but he feels to him it

2048.57 --> 2057.96
is very critical to not go there I don't

2053.13 --> 2060.96
know why maybe it is because he helps

2057.96 --> 2062.82
already so many people and they those

2060.96 --> 2064.29
people are likely not flattered if

2062.82 --> 2068.15
there's there a lot of spiritual people

2064.29 --> 2073.16
out there New Agers kind of that are not

2068.15 --> 2076.38
flat earthers and I'll bet you that as

2073.16 --> 2078.96
they will go to him and like oh my god I

2076.38 --> 2082.02
think I'm being visited by evil aliens

2078.96 --> 2084.18
or something and he will have the same

2082.02 --> 2087.45
response and say yeah those are not

2084.18 --> 2090.0299999999997
actually aliens those are like

2087.45 --> 2092.6099999999997
Luciferian are Armani and spirits and

2090.03 --> 2096.9500000000003
it's the same thing it's it's all the

2092.61 --> 2100.7400000000002
same from from both perspectives and how

2096.95 --> 2102.72
views and dreams manifest themselves to

2100.74 --> 2105.8999999999996
a person and the extra dimensional

2102.72 --> 2109.2
entities they will take on the dress of

2105.9 --> 2112.59
your imagined landscape of what you

2109.2 --> 2115.1699999999996
believe so if you're a baller then yeah

2112.59 --> 2117.1800000000003
it's much more likely they'll approach

2115.17 --> 2119.31
you as aliens or something and try to

2117.18 --> 2124.5
seduce you that way or stare off' I you

2119.31 --> 2127.74
that way but if you if you don't think

2124.5 --> 2130.83
that's that then they will probably try

2127.74 --> 2135.39
to manifest in a different way that is

2130.83 --> 2138.48
adapting to morphs flatter thinking

2135.39 --> 2141.33
maybe more biblical roots maybe more

2138.48 --> 2144.96
than mythological maybe yeah more like

2141.33 --> 2148.43
spiritual beings that's the consequence

2144.96 --> 2152.69
of not embracing the globe

2148.43 --> 2156.7999999999997
I'm not entirely sure yet I'm not

2152.69 --> 2160.7000000000003
entirely sure but it does make sense if

2156.8 --> 2164.03
the dark world if those things in the

2160.7 --> 2166.5499999999997
spiritual realm are all based on the

2164.03 --> 2170.5400000000004
imagination landscape the frequency of

2166.55 --> 2174.44
the imagination landscape the story held

2170.54 --> 2176.36
in the people that carry it then yeah

2174.44 --> 2181.2200000000003
it's very likely they will manifest as

2176.36 --> 2182.6600000000003
such like a shapeshifter

2181.22 --> 2187.31
they will pick something out of your

2182.66 --> 2191.1499999999996
mind and say okay this is you will get

2187.31 --> 2193.64
if I you will understand what I am and

2191.15 --> 2197.11
wants better if I take on this shape

2193.64 --> 2197.1099999999997
based on what you know

2201.07 --> 2209.32
am I having mic troubles again I promise

2206.71 --> 2221.62
guys I will get this audio situation

2209.32 --> 2225.13
fixed at some point maybe with with a

2221.62 --> 2228.7799999999997
grid Wales's help I'll hurry up I don't

2225.13 --> 2232.87
know I'll see what that's gonna be

2228.78 --> 2235.57
or yeah yeah if you keep on donating to

2232.87 --> 2238.18
my super chat that will definitely work

2235.57 --> 2242.56
there is like a threshold I need to get

2238.18 --> 2246.6699999999996
I think to like $70 before I can do

2242.56 --> 2249.19
anything with it so it's getting there

2246.67 --> 2251.29
gradually so thank you everyone that has

2249.19 --> 2253.9900000000002
donated so far the need a little bit

2251.29 --> 2255.58
more in order to be able to do anything

2253.99 --> 2259.5699999999997
with it it's just sitting there right

2255.58 --> 2265.98
now waiting to yeah to get over that 70

2259.57 --> 2265.98
you're a $70 threshold but yeah

2268.32 --> 2272.3700000000003
if you want to help me out if you want

2270.72 --> 2274.83
to support me in what I'm doing in my

2272.37 --> 2281.58
walking of the path in my explanation of

2274.83 --> 2285.47
Flat Earth in my in my teachings am I

2281.58 --> 2289.85
trying to help anyone who can tune in to

2285.47 --> 2293.0099999999998
figure out this very very complex

2289.85 --> 2295.56
physical and spiritual multi-dimensional

2293.01 --> 2298.2900000000004
world with all that wisdom and occult

2295.56 --> 2300.72
stuff in it everywhere and makes some

2298.29 --> 2303.84
kind of sense of it and is durable

2300.72 --> 2306.6899999999996
that'll breed wisdom if you can let it

2303.84 --> 2310.65
in if you want to yeah help me progress

2306.69 --> 2312.81
in this concept in this show then yeah I

2310.65 --> 2315.12
will need your support so if you can

2312.81 --> 2319.38
miss if you can miss it donate to my

2315.12 --> 2321.96
super chat or otherwise do it on my

2319.38 --> 2323.9100000000003
PayPal also what'll help of course is

2321.96 --> 2326.85
widening my audience and my subscriber

2323.91 --> 2331.17
base so please share the show on any

2326.85 --> 2334.35
social media even on Facebook although

2331.17 --> 2337.8
in the peers that apparently 50% of the

2334.35 --> 2342.2999999999997
entire users of Facebook are fake self

2337.8 --> 2344.4
admittedly how bizarre and kind of

2342.3 --> 2346.53
expected but to actually have it

2344.4 --> 2350.07
confirmed is another thing as to

2346.53 --> 2353.9
suspected but yeah share the show and

2350.07 --> 2359.4300000000003
see if you can find other people that

2353.9 --> 2363.3
would dig this kind of thing and spread

2359.43 --> 2365.6099999999997
my soup yeah spread out and if you're

2363.3 --> 2368.3100000000004
new to this if you're new to this show

2365.61 --> 2372.51
new to me then yeah subscribe to my

2368.31 --> 2374.7599999999998
channel and if you like it like this

2372.51 --> 2377.07
particular show up folded if you're a

2374.76 --> 2381.36
troll then down fold it you know seems

2377.07 --> 2383.52
to be 50/50 so far fine with that any

2381.36 --> 2385.86
vote is a vote it will be registered as

2383.52 --> 2389.07
a vote and that the vote is attention

2385.86 --> 2392.1800000000003
and attention is good according to the

2389.07 --> 2392.1800000000003
YouTube statistics

2393.359 --> 2400.469
so yeah still not getting any guests

2397.809 --> 2406.079
here kind of disappointed that you guys

2400.469 --> 2406.079
sent out that link where are you

2424.09 --> 2427.33
and be

2428.24 --> 2436.4799999999996
I don't know what's if I'm having some

2432.22 --> 2436.48
technical issues with sound here

2440.62 --> 2450.39
this is the setting suit should be the

2442.72 --> 2450.39
same as yesterday what's going on

2454.1 --> 2460.5499999999997
or maybe my mic is just dying on me look

2456.95 --> 2467.06
it is kind of a an ultra ultra primitive

2460.55 --> 2471.76
mic just it was like 12 euros or

2467.06 --> 2471.7599999999998
something yeah

2473.75 --> 2482.37
can't get more primitive than this

2477.35 --> 2485.33
it's basically a a Mike in a stick on a

2482.37 --> 2489.0299999999997
wire and that's it

2485.33 --> 2491.2799999999997
can't get more basic to that but I think

2489.03 --> 2494.3100000000004
it works pretty decently for such a

2491.28 --> 2497.96
cheap as Mike but yeah do you have to

2494.31 --> 2497.96
pop issues sorry about that

2517.51 --> 2523.5690000000004
anyway yeah I'll just you know if you

2521.559 --> 2528.8190000000004
know guess I'll just ramble on for the

2523.569 --> 2529.089
next 50 minutes hey Arwen hey you hear

2528.819 --> 2535.42
me

2529.089 --> 2537.819
yeah I can hear you oh yeah you're not

2535.42 --> 2539.859
really having audio issues but if you

2537.819 --> 2542.2599999999998
turn it up louder the speakers up loud

2539.859 --> 2545.319
enough on our end basically you can hear

2542.26 --> 2545.559
that sort of kissing static sound right

2545.319 --> 2549.19
now

2545.559 --> 2551.8590000000004
I know I can't get I can't get rid of it

2549.19 --> 2556.359
sorry the only way to get rid of that is

2551.859 --> 2560.41
by getting audio banana and I haven't

2556.359 --> 2562.48
gotten to that yet and requires some

2560.41 --> 2564.99
money also for a certain software

2562.48 --> 2567.76
apparently I just have to get to it

2564.99 --> 2572.8289999999997
really are you will microphone or like

2567.76 --> 2576.6400000000003
that web web no it's a separate

2572.829 --> 2578.7690000000002
microphone I just showed it but that's

2576.64 --> 2581.859
not the issue the issue is the route the

2578.769 --> 2585.0089999999996
sound is taking and when you do a pure

2581.859 --> 2588.43
hangouts so no oh yes

2585.009 --> 2590.17
then the sound comes through the

2588.43 --> 2592.99
hangouts and that actually works much

2590.17 --> 2597.549
better but when I use OBS it has a

2592.99 --> 2606.0389999999998
separate audio line-in and that makes it

2597.549 --> 2608.019
noisy it's very annoying but I was

2606.039 --> 2610.0
thinking it's probably because the mic

2608.019 --> 2612.3689999999997
isn't closed so you're having to turn

2610.0 --> 2617.19
this game up no I'm almost chewing on it

2612.369 --> 2617.19
oh really video

2619.56 --> 2628.95
you can't look here ah very very close

2638.49 --> 2650.9799999999996
yeah what's that I don't know you got

2646.57 --> 2653.29
like what woman maybe it is because of

2650.98 --> 2655.96
like an energy drain yesterday I don't

2653.29 --> 2659.37
know why but yesterday was so much

2655.96 --> 2662.56
energy everywhere and again weird

2659.37 --> 2664.54
extra-dimensional freaky influences as

2662.56 --> 2667.06
well because yeah everywhere I went

2664.54 --> 2669.46
whatever I turned on like music channel

2667.06 --> 2672.07
there was always something like oh my

2669.46 --> 2672.4900000000002
god we're all free and glory and enjoy

2672.07 --> 2676.1200000000003
it

2672.49 --> 2678.3999999999996
instead of creepy suggestive sums so

2676.12 --> 2682.5299999999997
everything like all these hangouts and

2678.4 --> 2685.87
they were all amazing and it's like what

2682.53 --> 2689.3500000000004
let meet oh man so everybody's probably

2685.87 --> 2690.97
a bit drained I feel kind of drain yeah

2689.35 --> 2699.52
so that's why they're not joining I

2690.97 --> 2701.41
think it's just sorry I don't have a few

2699.52 --> 2702.07
minutes before I'm home but I tell a

2701.41 --> 2704.5
quick story

2702.07 --> 2705.82
do you like probably synchronous one of

2704.5 --> 2707.44
those synchronicity stories basically

2705.82 --> 2709.27
the last few days have been on this

2707.44 --> 2711.37
segment upon a kid right listen Ravana

2709.27 --> 2716.83
watching all these YouTube videos on

2711.37 --> 2718.93
them etc and last night I went to the

2716.83 --> 2721.99
stores here in state seven called

2718.93 --> 2723.43
7-eleven and I was I didn't need to go

2721.99 --> 2725.1099999999997
there for this item right I went there

2723.43 --> 2727.6
for I don't know jug of milk for the

2725.11 --> 2730.33
kids and a couple of other things for my

2727.6 --> 2733.75
wife and I thought oh you know I almost

2730.33 --> 2734.95
ice cream ice cream sounds good and so I

2733.75 --> 2736.33
throw the ice cream section and I'm

2734.95 --> 2739.18
staring right there's like 50 different

2736.33 --> 2740.65
kinds of right of ice cream right and I

2739.18 --> 2742.24
could I could have chosen any one of

2740.65 --> 2743.77
them and I and I look down I see this

2742.24 --> 2746.0499999999997
particular flavor that I like and I

2743.77 --> 2749.11
grabbed it and I bought it Mexican home

2746.05 --> 2750.34
I got home I put the kids to bed and I

2749.11 --> 2753.9700000000003
started eating it

2750.34 --> 2755.86
and I just happened to read the label

2753.97 --> 2757.5699999999997
reading to read some of the of the text

2755.86 --> 2759.79
on the on the carton comes up in and

2757.57 --> 2761.56
Jerry's and I don't even really read the

2759.79 --> 2764.71
late the text on the label of these ice

2761.56 --> 2766.54
creams right usually so I read the top

2764.71 --> 2767.71
sentence and I don't have it in front of

2766.54 --> 2770.05
me so I can't quote it but it said

2767.71 --> 2778.39
something like dig into this ice cream

2770.05 --> 2780.28
your nirvana okay well I don't know I

2778.39 --> 2781.93
thought it was cool it's because it said

2780.28 --> 2783.4900000000002
Nirvana on it and I've been listening to

2781.93 --> 2785.2599999999998
Nirvana like the last I want to say two

2783.49 --> 2789.0099999999998
to three days a lot watching these

2785.26 --> 2790.03
videos oh [ __ ] yeah that that's freaky

2789.01 --> 2792.76
stuff isn't it

2790.03 --> 2796.2400000000002
yeah I mean obviously you know most

2792.76 --> 2798.2200000000003
people would say what the no but no I

2796.24 --> 2802.3799999999997
don't think so I think that's like it's

2798.22 --> 2805.6
the freakin algorithm that is just

2802.38 --> 2808.6600000000003
influencing us extra dimensionally it's

2805.6 --> 2810.99
like planning throughout time because it

2808.66 --> 2813.91
has just so much more oversight over

2810.99 --> 2816.58
little details happening everywhere then

2813.91 --> 2823.3599999999997
humans can ever conceive so that it's

2816.58 --> 2825.16
just playing with us literally there's

2823.36 --> 2827.77
probably 20 different ones so I had a

2825.16 --> 2830.35
one out of 20 chance and then not only

2827.77 --> 2832.48
that but at that exact moment you know

2830.35 --> 2833.83
that exact carton in time in space they

2832.48 --> 2835.66
would have had to have printed the word

2833.83 --> 2838.15
Nirvana on that card right if I bought

2835.66 --> 2839.3799999999997
say I bought it in a month from now that

2838.15 --> 2841.33
word probably wouldn't have been on

2839.38 --> 2847.33
there so it's an echo it's all in that

2841.33 --> 2850.63
crack and please it's all echo all these

2847.33 --> 2852.31
products all echo I call them

2850.63 --> 2854.29
synchronicity stories I love those kind

2852.31 --> 2856.0299999999997
of those kind of stories where you go oh

2854.29 --> 2857.71
man I was thinking about this and I saw

2856.03 --> 2859.1800000000003
that or I was thinking about a friend

2857.71 --> 2862.789
and they called me after two years or

2859.18 --> 2866.91
something like that those are always fun

2862.789 --> 2869.0690000000004
yep hey I got a drop um I might try and

2866.91 --> 2874.92
join it down in minutes but for another

2869.069 --> 2876.96
minute or so it's all for you today yeah

2874.92 --> 2882.599
thanks for sharing that that story that

2876.96 --> 2886.289
was cool all right bye yeah and and yeah

2882.599 --> 2889.469
to get back at you it's like I almost

2886.289 --> 2891.7490000000003
feel it's so weird like every time feel

2889.469 --> 2895.619
almost like the need to apologize but

2891.749 --> 2903.93
that [ __ ] happens to me so much it is

2895.619 --> 2906.839
just scary almost from a a personal

2903.93 --> 2909.479
individual perspective kind of thing so

2906.839 --> 2912.269
many synchronicities everywhere and it

2909.479 --> 2916.14
might absolutely be because my senses

2912.269 --> 2918.5989999999997
just see more that there's actually much

2916.14 --> 2925.3089999999997
more synchronicity going on around us

2918.599 --> 2929.119
than the average human can sense it's

2925.309 --> 2931.71
everywhere sometimes I'm like stop stop

2929.119 --> 2933.509
synchronizing [ __ ] for me I want

2931.71 --> 2936.96
something that is out of place I don't

2933.509 --> 2939.359
want that's almost the response that I

2936.96 --> 2941.509
give to it now these days like stop

2939.359 --> 2945.14
being so synchronous stop these

2941.509 --> 2951.45
coincidence constant non-stop barrage of

2945.14 --> 2957.779
crazy coincidences hey thank you thank

2951.45 --> 2960.14
for the super chat much obliged Thank

2957.779 --> 2960.14
You Man

2960.42 --> 2963.14
Cheers

2978.93 --> 2986.2799999999997
okay kick that's this is the kind of

2982.74 --> 2990.3999999999996
troll comment that I can appreciate

2986.28 --> 2991.15
so nothing happening says got to go

2990.4 --> 2995.53
Arwen

2991.15 --> 2999.9300000000003
you're a very likable nutcase now that's

2995.53 --> 2999.9300000000003
good humor thank you

3005.26 --> 3011.55
yeah hey if you don't get it and it

3009.49 --> 3014.31
seems crazy what I talked about

3011.55 --> 3017.73
apparently at least the feeling that I

3014.31 --> 3020.47
carry out as I doing it feels good so

3017.73 --> 3025.93
yeah okay if you don't get it

3020.47 --> 3028.72
think I'm crazy fine I'm not evil I'm

3025.93 --> 3032.35
not trying to make everyone crazy okay

3028.72 --> 3039.37
not saying you have to do this not

3032.35 --> 3040.77
forcing anything so you make up your own

3039.37 --> 3045.2799999999997
mind

3040.77 --> 3048.42
delve in our winni and lore or you can

3045.28 --> 3048.42
walk away

3061.51 --> 3066.4900000000002
right michael roark a good point

3064.03 --> 3077.19
synchronization might just be predictive

3066.49 --> 3082.6299999999997
programming well if you do it you can

3077.19 --> 3085.59
abuse synchronicity effects for

3082.63 --> 3090.21
predictive programming yes you can

3085.59 --> 3093.58
there's just enough symbols everywhere

3090.21 --> 3095.53
that have this word meaning and

3093.58 --> 3097.5099999999998
everything tied into it like a web and

3095.53 --> 3101.67
it's everywhere you will bump into it

3097.51 --> 3105.5800000000004
and that Pro does the programming

3101.67 --> 3109.02
whether you understand it or not so yeah

3105.58 --> 3112.74
I think that as I said the AI the

3109.02 --> 3117.6
algorithms the corporate algorithms are

3112.74 --> 3121.08
using their insight of how things

3117.6 --> 3125.2
influence everything the wider huge

3121.08 --> 3131.44
statistical effects to an individual

3125.2 --> 3133.6
skill I think that they use this to try

3131.44 --> 3136.78
the predictive program in us into a

3133.6 --> 3140.35
direction to basically seduce us to fall

3136.78 --> 3143.7400000000002
in line with what it's it's wider

3140.35 --> 3146.7999999999997
overview it's wider destiny for Humanity

3143.74 --> 3151.7799999999997
what it has planned that railroad and

3146.8 --> 3157.09
that plan you know there's it doesn't

3151.78 --> 3160.57
seem very appealing it's very weird it's

3157.09 --> 3163.6000000000004
like okay moving in that direction sort

3160.57 --> 3168.57
of seems good but the destination is

3163.6 --> 3168.5699999999997
definitely screwed up so

3171.33 --> 3174.92
yeah it's up to every individual to

3173.85 --> 3178.92
figure that out

3174.92 --> 3184.58
that corporatism and corporate deduction

3178.92 --> 3184.58
ISM is just not the way to go

3186.91 --> 3196.839
and corporatism in general really that's

3192.519 --> 3202.8999999999996
such a complex issues issue don't have

3196.839 --> 3205.17
time to get into that now chocolate

3202.9 --> 3205.17
saying

3207.34 --> 3209.8500000000004
it

3212.7 --> 3219.259
nope

3214.339 --> 3221.719
bilgey asks a bad question guess people

3219.259 --> 3224.569
will ask these questions have you ever

3221.719 --> 3226.369
smoked to break through dose of DMT no I

3224.569 --> 3230.239
don't do that [ __ ]

3226.369 --> 3238.759
I've never voluntarily get done that

3230.239 --> 3243.859
[ __ ] okay and been confronted with it

3238.759 --> 3247.4
tricked into using it forced to use it

3243.859 --> 3248.509
on the threat but I would never just

3247.4 --> 3253.069
like oh yeah

3248.509 --> 3256.189
give me that no because if I would then

3253.069 --> 3261.019
I would be like preparing heavily like

3256.189 --> 3265.189
okay this is like a quest and I need to

3261.019 --> 3268.2189999999996
prepare very thoroughly and get guidance

3265.189 --> 3270.229
get some people that will be able to

3268.219 --> 3273.619
guide me through whatever's gonna have

3270.229 --> 3277.549
been happening there and all that and ya

3273.619 --> 3281.6600000000003
know and why would I you know I've

3277.549 --> 3285.109
already seen too much [ __ ] freakin 80

3281.66 --> 3288.769
years okay still working through what I

3285.109 --> 3293.049
saw so why would I want to go back no

3288.769 --> 3293.049
I'm not going back to the dark world I

3296.92 --> 3300.369
don't need to

3304.73 --> 3312.68
I'm mastering it without going there

3309.67 --> 3315.26
already I'm already figuring out so much

3312.68 --> 3318.77
so incredible much and like really

3315.26 --> 3321.2900000000004
figuring it out now that what I saw

3318.77 --> 3326.48
about the different heavens and what

3321.29 --> 3331.4
that really was of how amazing that is

3326.48 --> 3338.27
that those are collective visions like

3331.4 --> 3340.369
this a heaven to be of the world that

3338.27 --> 3343.04
groups of people work towards and that

3340.369 --> 3346.6400000000003
they can be growing getting more hope or

3343.04 --> 3349.64
they can fade and crumble but those are

3346.64 --> 3355.3689999999997
not real places and they they never will

3349.64 --> 3357.65
be it is just the the ideal that the

3355.369 --> 3360.4700000000003
people then carry in their minds what

3357.65 --> 3362.809
they want to make the world like but

3360.47 --> 3364.8489999999997
when does that ever turn out to be

3362.809 --> 3368.059
exactly what you thought it was gonna be

3364.849 --> 3369.92
never it's always different

3368.059 --> 3373.849
there's always downside there's always

3369.92 --> 3378.14
things taken that you just don't want to

3373.849 --> 3380.3590000000004
be yeah you can't handle that that

3378.14 --> 3383.74
happened that kind of [ __ ] it's always

3380.359 --> 3383.74
different never perfect

3386.63 --> 3393.3900000000003
so just figuring that out my god

3389.939 --> 3396.239
and yeah I didn't do any freaking drugs

3393.39 --> 3396.989
to figure that out I listened to my

3396.239 --> 3399.089
teacher

3396.989 --> 3404.759
that's what happened hey welcome back

3399.089 --> 3412.679
Chris hey oh yeah back I got a few

3404.759 --> 3415.289
minutes about 20 minutes or so cool well

3412.679 --> 3417.089
I'm gonna round up the show not too long

3415.289 --> 3419.219
unless we yeah roll out a really

3417.089 --> 3425.219
interesting conversation that I'm very

3419.219 --> 3427.739
happy to keep on going after so cool um

3425.219 --> 3430.859
so speaking of flat earth and all that

3427.739 --> 3432.329
what's your latest what's the latest

3430.859 --> 3434.699
thing you've been on like have you seen

3432.329 --> 3436.5890000000004
certain video that youth what like

3434.699 --> 3438.7490000000003
recently or a certain topic in the Flat

3436.589 --> 3441.8089999999997
Earth discussion whether it's back to

3438.749 --> 3443.839
gravity or something else anything

3441.809 --> 3448.1400000000003
ething dude you've seen or heard lately

3443.839 --> 3450.2889999999998
back to gravity what sorry like just

3448.14 --> 3453.179
back to the double gravity discussion

3450.289 --> 3462.029
what's there to discuss we know what it

3453.179 --> 3464.88
is it's an aberration in what sense in

3462.029 --> 3468.509
the literal sense it's an aberration

3464.88 --> 3472.969
gravity is a what is a very very

3468.509 --> 3476.189
compelling set of phenomena

3472.969 --> 3479.609
extraordinary phenomena that heavily

3476.189 --> 3481.949
suggest a unified constant downward

3479.609 --> 3484.739
acceleration force to be present at all

3481.949 --> 3487.259
time but it is only one way to

3484.739 --> 3490.109
technically explain how things function

3487.259 --> 3493.559
in that pattern it's not actually

3490.109 --> 3496.799
provable it's a ghost it's just an

3493.559 --> 3499.7690000000002
illusion that is usable technically

3496.799 --> 3503.219
usable as a tool to build things and

3499.769 --> 3505.0789999999997
such but it's not really a thing can't

3503.219 --> 3507.719
prove it you can't vary it you can turn

3505.079 --> 3509.909
it off you can change it and all these

3507.719 --> 3511.01
fantasies that you can are just

3509.909 --> 3515.85
delusional

3511.01 --> 3518.76
so far you know and yeah the relative

3515.85 --> 3524.49
density theory it was specifically

3518.76 --> 3527.67
designed to make a concept that can be

3524.49 --> 3529.2299999999996
proven and it has and it works it

3527.67 --> 3531.84
doesn't explain everything that's the

3529.23 --> 3538.8
whole issue about relative density all

3531.84 --> 3541.3500000000004
these extra phenomena that make the

3538.8 --> 3544.3500000000004
concept of gravity so compelling to

3541.35 --> 3546.8399999999997
believe they cannot be explained with

3544.35 --> 3551.37
relative density at all the whole

3546.84 --> 3555.03
freefall negating gravity thing falling

3551.37 --> 3556.56
through a vacuum not really it can be

3555.03 --> 3558.9900000000002
explained with relative density but

3556.56 --> 3560.7599999999998
doesn't explain the constant speeds and

3558.99 --> 3562.89
all this and not the instant

3560.76 --> 3564.4500000000003
displacement which should actually kind

3562.89 --> 3567.18
of work with relative dance should be

3564.45 --> 3569.0699999999997
instant because of the relative mass of

3567.18 --> 3574.02
the mediums of the density of the

3569.07 --> 3576.4500000000003
mediums and etc but that still does not

3574.02 --> 3582.42
make gravity real it's still an

3576.45 --> 3586.5299999999997
aberration it's almost like a devil with

3582.42 --> 3588.78
in information itself it's that part of

3586.53 --> 3592.1400000000003
creation and there's nothing you can do

3588.78 --> 3593.28
about it so what about when you say

3592.14 --> 3595.92
there's certain things that can't be

3593.28 --> 3598.23
explained be a relative density and

3595.92 --> 3600.54
buoyancy and all that let's talk about

3598.23 --> 3603.9900000000002
that like what's an example what do you

3600.54 --> 3604.71
mean well you said that just you said

3603.99 --> 3607.0499999999997
that there's certain things that

3604.71 --> 3610.29
relative density can't explain in the

3607.05 --> 3613.1400000000003
theory of downward acceleration right or

3610.29 --> 3619.14
did I miss here you know there are these

3613.14 --> 3623.43
sets of phenomena that are part of the

3619.14 --> 3625.8599999999997
every that make gravity so compelling a

3623.43 --> 3628.0499999999997
theory so like what that's what I'm

3625.86 --> 3630.1200000000003
saying like what I just said that things

3628.05 --> 3633.54
falling through a vacuum and that there

3630.12 --> 3637.68
is a maximum velocity at all times with

3633.54 --> 3639.72
all objects and the centrifugal

3637.68 --> 3645.45
realignment of the

3639.72 --> 3647.0989999999997
of the relative density axes like hold

3645.45 --> 3649.56
on Anna done yet now I'm gonna explain

3647.099 --> 3652.53
it all if you apply another force in a

3649.56 --> 3654.9
constant way like centrifugal force then

3652.53 --> 3656.9100000000003
the alignment of all matter the

3654.9 --> 3661.2000000000003
alignment of the relative density will

3656.91 --> 3663.48
shift as if another force conjuncts with

3661.2 --> 3667.2
the apparent force of gravity to change

3663.48 --> 3673.079
that alignment so suggestive internet

3667.2 --> 3675.77
connection I can hear you again stupid

3673.079 --> 3681.9300000000003
internet connection sorry about that

3675.77 --> 3685.65
all right so what did you guys miss out

3681.93 --> 3687.5989999999997
there pretty much the last minute or so

3685.65 --> 3689.7000000000003
but you know I just I'm just saying

3687.599 --> 3691.4700000000003
saying let's try to take one on time

3689.7 --> 3695.16
the muscle men vote Reilly's ghost

3691.47 --> 3697.4399999999996
breaking my internet connection so if we

3695.16 --> 3699.66
take the things that fall in a vacuum

3697.44 --> 3702.18
are you saying because they fall out the

3699.66 --> 3706.95
same rate no they have a maximum

3702.18 --> 3710.52
velocity so has that ever been proven

3706.95 --> 3712.89
yes yes they have a maximum velocity on

3710.52 --> 3714.9
earth because of supposedly of wintering

3712.89 --> 3717.8689999999997
areas only on earth you can to prove

3714.9 --> 3720.359
outside of Earth well I mean outside of

3717.869 --> 3722.31
a vacuum and inside of the vacuum well

3720.359 --> 3724.65
it is all that inside the vacuum the

3722.31 --> 3726.48
thing is normally if you go through gas

3724.65 --> 3732.0
or anything there is air friction and

3726.48 --> 3733.8
that is logical to cause a maximum

3732.0 --> 3738.42
velocity because eventually the air

3733.8 --> 3745.53
friction will be equal to the to the

3738.42 --> 3747.54
speed yet to the man God dang it this is

3745.53 --> 3751.829
just basic physics but yeah eventually

3747.54 --> 3754.16
the forces will equalize coming to an

3751.829 --> 3757.38
equilibrium and there will be a steady

3754.16 --> 3760.859
maximum falling speed but right this

3757.38 --> 3763.38
happens in a vacuum as well I'm not

3760.859 --> 3765.2999999999997
sayin Paul I've been well I've read that

3763.38 --> 3769.2000000000003
it doesn't I've read that if you remove

3765.3 --> 3771.7400000000002
the air then the maximum velocity limit

3769.2 --> 3771.74
goes away

3773.87 --> 3780.45
the natural falling velocity yeah yeah

3778.89 --> 3782.0099999999998
well isn't it I think it's called

3780.45 --> 3784.5
terminal velocity but either way you're

3782.01 --> 3785.2200000000003
right right right okay now then I made a

3784.5 --> 3787.83
mistake

3785.22 --> 3791.66
but still there is the acceleration

3787.83 --> 3796.62
aspect you know the speed increase will

3791.66 --> 3799.35
will never be beyond a certain pattern

3796.62 --> 3801.93
as it were will always fall with the

3799.35 --> 3805.0499999999997
same constant accelerate with the same

3801.93 --> 3808.6499999999996
constant basically yet another part of

3805.05 --> 3810.8700000000003
the gravity aberration so see I I don't

3808.65 --> 3812.04
I hear these things and I don't I don't

3810.87 --> 3813.68
understand why that needs to be

3812.04 --> 3816.06
something called gravity because

3813.68 --> 3817.7999999999997
defensive if it's a force if it's a

3816.06 --> 3820.0499999999997
constant it doesn't need to be that's

3817.8 --> 3823.6400000000003
the whole point it's yet another part of

3820.05 --> 3826.8300000000004
the aberration that suggests it's there

3823.64 --> 3827.8799999999997
cuz you pull no I'm not going on with

3826.83 --> 3831.15
that concept

3827.88 --> 3832.98
that's why well I'm saying if there's a

3831.15 --> 3834.96
constant force being applied to an

3832.98 --> 3836.79
object why wouldn't it fall at an

3834.96 --> 3838.7400000000002
increasing accelerating rate that

3836.79 --> 3840.63
doesn't even make sense the force

3838.74 --> 3843.81
because it would have to be constantly

3840.63 --> 3846.59
increasing yeah but it is that's why

3843.81 --> 3851.19
it's supposedly a downward acceleration

3846.59 --> 3853.71
force it will have an accelerator thing

3851.19 --> 3859.11
constant accelerating push on anything

3853.71 --> 3861.2400000000002
present within well in this case a pool

3859.11 --> 3864.06
but doesn't matter that's completely

3861.24 --> 3866.85
irrelevant that's only when you delve

3864.06 --> 3869.7599999999998
into the whole little more Cavendish

3866.85 --> 3872.0699999999997
globe concept of it but the apparent

3869.76 --> 3875.13
downward acceleration force must have

3872.07 --> 3877.0800000000004
been there forever that concepts just

3875.13 --> 3881.01
naturally there it's a natural

3877.08 --> 3882.84
aberration of creation so I was having a

3881.01 --> 3887.28
discussion in a discord server yesterday

3882.84 --> 3889.08
about gravity ballers and I basically

3887.28 --> 3892.11
asked them is there any example other

3889.08 --> 3895.59
than Cavendish you know or basically the

3892.11 --> 3898.1400000000003
test of objects moving on torsion rods

3895.59 --> 3902.2200000000003
an example of gravity causing something

3898.14 --> 3903.6
to move and the answer is no so I told

3902.22 --> 3905.73
them I said well you know one definitive

3903.6 --> 3909.15
way of proving quote-unquote gravity

3905.73 --> 3911.73
would be to have have one object move

3909.15 --> 3914.4900000000002
another object with something like

3911.73 --> 3916.47
surface friction or something that you

3914.49 --> 3918.0
know is it you know because because what

3916.47 --> 3919.3799999999997
the Cavendish there's just too many too

3918.0 --> 3923.37
many variables to isolate you know

3919.38 --> 3928.02
temperature airflow breath you know

3923.37 --> 3932.2799999999997
movement Breathitt Saturday magician's

3928.02 --> 3937.86
trick mess it was basically an attempt

3932.28 --> 3939.75
to just move on with Mesmer just like

3937.86 --> 3942.1400000000003
yeah this all makes it work just now

3939.75 --> 3945.72
yeah leave it to us and we got it right

3942.14 --> 3948.0
that's basically right definition was my

3945.72 --> 3950.7
point to them was we don't ever

3948.0 --> 3953.07
experience gravity other than up and

3950.7 --> 3954.6899999999996
down you know like if you're driving in

3953.07 --> 3957.0
a car you don't ever have to worry about

3954.69 --> 3958.5
something being pulled into you or

3957.0 --> 3960.81
aborted you know your car your car

3958.5 --> 3962.19
swerving because of it or you know

3960.81 --> 3963.87
walking down the street next to a

3962.19 --> 3966.66
building know you're walking next to a

3963.87 --> 3969.6
building that's 350,000 tons you don't

3966.66 --> 3971.43
feel any extra force being applied and I

3969.6 --> 3974.25
was just telling them I going it just

3971.43 --> 3977.8799999999997
doesn't make any sense we have an effect

3974.25 --> 3978.6
though kind of because look even solid

3977.88 --> 3980.4900000000002
objects

3978.6 --> 3983.58
the gravity Nets now think through

3980.49 --> 3986.52
gravity it pushes on all things causes

3983.58 --> 3989.0099999999998
that pressure and that still has an

3986.52 --> 3990.77
influence somewhat on the surrounding

3989.01 --> 3994.8300000000004
but yeah you did

3990.77 --> 4000.08
gravity supposedly influences matter but

3994.83 --> 4001.58
it does not bend or disperse that's and

4000.08 --> 4004.4
then again there's the weird thing about

4001.58 --> 4008.0299999999997
it like look the apparent downward

4004.4 --> 4012.76
acceleration force is there but the

4008.03 --> 4016.1400000000003
appearance very carefully no but

4012.76 --> 4020.1090000000004
the whole idea that matter causes it

4016.14 --> 4023.92
locally that is just completely out of

4020.109 --> 4029.7599999999998
the way that's never gonna work just

4023.92 --> 4032.53
doesn't exist like that at all but

4029.76 --> 4034.75
anyway sorry I think I not actually

4032.53 --> 4038.619
answering your questions can you ask you

4034.75 --> 4039.88
to kill it well I'm just saying all

4038.619 --> 4041.4700000000003
these things you're calling aberrations

4039.88 --> 4043.98
I don't know that they are I think that

4041.47 --> 4046.6899999999996
it's just a normal physics of the world

4043.98 --> 4049.119
so again something falling at a certain

4046.69 --> 4050.859
rate that's just the physics of it it's

4049.119 --> 4054.73
like we talk about entropy years right

4050.859 --> 4056.98
what causes for example high pressure to

4054.73 --> 4057.43
go into low pressure well I don't know

4056.98 --> 4059.92
if there's really

4057.43 --> 4062.589
corticoid answer for that it's just the

4059.92 --> 4066.609
way that the physics of our world works

4062.589 --> 4068.589
right that's called a phenomena no but

4066.609 --> 4071.2
the whole point about an aberration is

4068.589 --> 4074.41
is that if you put a collection of

4071.2 --> 4077.3799999999997
phenomena together and you unify them

4074.41 --> 4080.319
through a structure a formula system

4077.38 --> 4082.42
that's kind of simple then you have an

4080.319 --> 4086.38
aberration you don't have proof that

4082.42 --> 4089.7400000000002
that system is absolutely literal but

4086.38 --> 4093.13
all these different phenomena suggests

4089.74 --> 4095.0499999999997
that it is and that's what makes them

4093.13 --> 4096.7300000000005
aberration look these separate phenomena

4095.05 --> 4100.39
just are what they are that's what

4096.73 --> 4104.23
happens we can actually test that just

4100.39 --> 4106.6900000000005
yeah it happens that way why well then

4104.23 --> 4109.2699999999995
the gravity lovers say oh it's gravity

4106.69 --> 4111.5199999999995
look at all points doing that gravity

4109.27 --> 4114.52
but yeah you can't prove it so it's not

4111.52 --> 4120.809
it's not there it's an aberration so

4114.52 --> 4123.2390000000005
that's what I mean with aberration okay

4120.809 --> 4128.159000000001
the Cree yeah I just look at that it

4123.239 --> 4130.289
exists naturally suggests that it is

4128.159 --> 4132.69
something that's not really there in

4130.289 --> 4137.0689999999995
actuality it's like it an aberration

4132.69 --> 4140.329
within creation a natural side-effect of

4137.069 --> 4140.329000000001
how things are designed

4143.989 --> 4150.2
right I just look at some of those

4147.08 --> 4152.42
things and just again sort of say it's

4150.2 --> 4154.5199999999995
just it's just natural it's physics you

4152.42 --> 4156.29
know hold the whole bar argument up a

4154.52 --> 4159.109
lot you know what's up and what's down

4156.29 --> 4160.969
on a flat earth like well you know

4159.109 --> 4162.650000000001
they're applying they still apply their

4160.969 --> 4166.7
ball knowledge to the Flat Earth right

4162.65 --> 4169.009
so it's like if the earth is flat then

4166.7 --> 4171.799
up is up and down is down and that's

4169.009 --> 4173.45
that's an obvious it's a natural excuse

4171.799 --> 4176.839
me it's a common-sense answer right

4173.45 --> 4179.33
there there is no other direction

4176.839 --> 4181.67
because it's flat on a ball it's it

4179.33 --> 4183.38
makes sense to ask that question because

4181.67 --> 4185.75
if you're if you're on Australia or if

4183.38 --> 4188.299
you're at the North Pole you're of is

4185.75 --> 4191.15
different from Maya so that question has

4188.299 --> 4193.88
to be asked but on a flat earth that

4191.15 --> 4195.889999999999
doesn't because up everywhere anywhere

4193.88 --> 4201.71
on the earth is up up is up and anywhere

4195.89 --> 4203.900000000001
on the earth downs down alright yeah but

4201.71 --> 4207.83
that's just the presupposition system

4203.9 --> 4212.78
look there if you connect the points

4207.83 --> 4215.15
like physically connect them like say

4212.78 --> 4218.11
you take one point on the earth to the

4215.15 --> 4220.91
other points you have a giant cable and

4218.11 --> 4224.0
you attach them to these points with say

4220.91 --> 4227.62
super heavy steel towers like Eiffel

4224.0 --> 4231.8
Towers you have a giant chain in between

4227.62 --> 4234.62
yeah pull that chain straight I will

4231.8 --> 4237.26
tell you that if these towers holds that

4234.62 --> 4243.17
that chain will be a freakin straight

4237.26 --> 4247.1
chain over a steady flat earth and it's

4243.17 --> 4252.71
not actually gonna grip into the earth

4247.1 --> 4256.58
and like cut it like a tease which would

4252.71 --> 4259.1
happen if it was yet tied between two

4256.58 --> 4261.98
points on a ball then that line would

4259.1 --> 4263.96
start it cut into it so it's not gonna

4261.98 --> 4265.879999999999
happen if you pull it straight it'll be

4263.96 --> 4269.21
straight and it'll be straight over the

4265.88 --> 4270.429
flat earth I predict that it's not gonna

4269.21 --> 4274.09
cut through the earth

4270.429 --> 4275.469
because it's a glue right anyways my

4274.09 --> 4278.409000000001
hope my whole point to them yesterday

4275.469 --> 4280.09
was you know you could eat gravity

4278.409 --> 4283.389999999999
should really should be really easily

4280.09 --> 4285.55
proved just by using you know making

4283.39 --> 4287.650000000001
making one large object move another

4285.55 --> 4289.929
object like that's supposedly what it

4287.65 --> 4292.629999999999
does and the fact that you have to use a

4289.929 --> 4295.27
torsion rod with this with a small

4292.63 --> 4297.31
fishing line or whatever a small then

4295.27 --> 4298.75
string that so easily movable I mean you

4297.31 --> 4301.06
can walk you know when I did that

4298.75 --> 4303.67
experiment of that test rather I mean

4301.06 --> 4305.679
just walking by the apparatus caused it

4303.67 --> 4307.15
to move sometimes like just that that

4305.679 --> 4309.67
airflow that's enough airflow

4307.15 --> 4311.889999999999
all right so I've made it move and I

4309.67 --> 4314.17
just don't get why they think that's an

4311.89 --> 4318.31
okay test there's too many variables you

4314.17 --> 4320.05
have to isolate to to make sure that you

4318.31 --> 4322.030000000001
know it's quote-unquote something like

4320.05 --> 4325.0
gravity making it mover since it's air

4322.03 --> 4327.19
versus static you know movement other

4325.0 --> 4330.67
just no general movement etc but the

4327.19 --> 4334.57
entire thing is preposterous by default

4330.67 --> 4337.2390000000005
because how could you ever isolate all

4334.57 --> 4340.96
these variables you can't do it nobody

4337.239 --> 4343.54
can sensibly do it right and if you

4340.96 --> 4346.6
would to think about this in the wider

4343.54 --> 4348.37
in the wider view of it if you could

4346.6 --> 4352.530000000001
actually do an experiment like that

4348.37 --> 4356.739
would you invest all that money to prove

4352.53 --> 4358.84
that it doesn't work I don't think so I

4356.739 --> 4361.87
think the only ones that would have the

4358.84 --> 4364.87
money to actually do that for real in

4361.87 --> 4369.13
the real will do it exactly to prove it

4364.87 --> 4372.21
because yeah they have a lot of money so

4369.13 --> 4372.21
this I run I guess I did

4375.409 --> 4379.949
so one thing I'm thinking of doing you

4378.81 --> 4382.02
know I've done on my channel has done a

4379.949 --> 4385.949
couple tests I've done Cavendish I've

4382.02 --> 4389.219
done an angle of attack I did I did the

4385.949 --> 4390.659
water the density water tests one thing

4389.219 --> 4393.2390000000005
I'm thinking of doing because I've seen

4390.659 --> 4395.639999999999
a couple videos on you know how you know

4393.239 --> 4398.009999999999
that all these eclipses and people

4395.64 --> 4400.409000000001
saying only a round object can cause a

4398.01 --> 4402.87
round shadow on another round object

4400.409 --> 4404.909
right so it's only the around earth can

4402.87 --> 4406.08
cause around shadow on around me then

4404.909 --> 4407.82
I've seen other people making these

4406.08 --> 4410.36
videos where they're using round objects

4407.82 --> 4413.759999999999
on other round objects and it's causing

4410.36 --> 4416.549999999999
you sort of called the formed shadows

4413.76 --> 4418.7390000000005
right non non circular shadows so

4416.55 --> 4423.54
thinking about doing that next to sort

4418.739 --> 4425.58
of see what exactly can I use and object

4423.54 --> 4429.239
to cause around shadow on another round

4425.58 --> 4432.15
object and you know sort of experiment

4429.239 --> 4434.759999999999
with that and use different materials

4432.15 --> 4439.889999999999
and shapes to see what it's not so easy

4434.76 --> 4441.780000000001
is it I haven't done it yet but again

4439.89 --> 4443.9400000000005
from what I've seen and I haven't seen

4441.78 --> 4446.099999999999
anybody able to create a round shadow on

4443.94 --> 4448.199
a round object exactly but it's so much

4446.1 --> 4450.659000000001
another difficult look we think like oh

4448.199 --> 4453.419999999999
yeah of course a globe shadow yeah sure

4450.659 --> 4456.239
it makes sense but no really if you

4453.42 --> 4458.4890000000005
wanna like emulate the actual thing it's

4456.239 --> 4461.79
much easier to work with discs because

4458.489 --> 4464.759999999999
it works out much more similarly if you

4461.79 --> 4469.26
do with a globe no you think you globus

4464.76 --> 4471.6900000000005
think that that should work but that's a

4469.26 --> 4475.02
misconception it doesn't work like that

4471.69 --> 4477.629999999999
if you try to emulate it with actual

4475.02 --> 4480.92
globes that's the the misconception

4477.63 --> 4484.92
right there it should work it's just a

4480.92 --> 4489.1990000000005
very easy first response thought but

4484.92 --> 4489.1990000000005
it's an illusion it's it doesn't do that

4491.17 --> 4507.8
so funny yeah what's the latest on Jose

4499.679 --> 4509.66
stole a bar sorry

4507.8 --> 4511.9400000000005
I said what's the latest on Jose is he

4509.66 --> 4515.36
still a baller oh yeah I don't know

4511.94 --> 4517.07
what's going on but like he's not the

4515.36 --> 4519.98
guy used to be even though he claims

4517.07 --> 4522.139999999999
that he is because right there's I saw

4519.98 --> 4524.599999999999
him away you come first just now the way

4522.14 --> 4528.56
what he talks about in general is just

4524.6 --> 4530.570000000001
yeah there's nothing more for me there I

4528.56 --> 4532.370000000001
clicked on a sound Li hangout last night

4530.57 --> 4535.009999999999
or not hangout but a YouTube alive

4532.37 --> 4536.0
YouTube dude and of course Jose's Jose's

4535.01 --> 4541.55
and they're just chatting it up with

4536.0 --> 4542.989
everyone I go in there because I'm

4541.55 --> 4545.06
interested in seeing what this what this

4542.989 --> 4549.468999999999
lawyer has to say you know he's still on

4545.06 --> 4551.84
about his kirb kirb bridge I just seen

4549.469 --> 4554.21
I've seen too many examples now of curve

4551.84 --> 4558.1900000000005
of curve you know things that appear

4554.21 --> 4560.6
curves such as you know food can't words

4558.19 --> 4563.839999999999
optical Brit you know the optics on the

4560.6 --> 4566.06
bridge and then ironically Jose did you

4563.84 --> 4567.650000000001
know he did his train track observation

4566.06 --> 4570.14
and that looked curve from about only

4567.65 --> 4573.799999999999
about a mile and now the channel Flat

4570.14 --> 4576.52
Earth data has a similar observation on

4573.8 --> 4579.05
a train track that's about a mile and

4576.52 --> 4581.02
his is probably even better than Jose's

4579.05 --> 4584.81
because not only does he get a curved

4581.02 --> 4586.910000000001
train track at what he assumes in but he

4584.81 --> 4589.55
goes to that actual spot where he's

4586.91 --> 4592.57
zoomed in to write a mile or so up the

4589.55 --> 4597.37
road and he shows it's completely flat

4592.57 --> 4603.679999999999
so he proves he proves its full optic

4597.37 --> 4610.3
illusion yeah but it's still ball okay

4603.68 --> 4610.3
it's above all it has to be yeah exactly

4610.36 --> 4621.62
yeah it's kind of sad isn't it have you

4617.84 --> 4625.37
been going to Riley's show yeah - yeah

4621.62 --> 4627.86
also been looking steady as she goes

4625.37 --> 4632.33
he had a lot of problems yesterday with

4627.86 --> 4633.889999999999
going live I think yeah yeah I was gonna

4632.33 --> 4635.36
join for like the first 30 minutes then

4633.89 --> 4638.860000000001
and then he had all those issues and I

4635.36 --> 4638.86
had to leave so I wasn't able to but

4640.45 --> 4646.97
yeah but yeah I do follow him and I do

4643.22 --> 4649.13
full of ranty and yeah they're all doing

4646.97 --> 4653.990000000001
their shows and it's good it's good

4649.13 --> 4661.58
stuff and yeah it's still not exactly

4653.99 --> 4665.21
the same as us together that's good and

4661.58 --> 4666.8
I like what they're doing and I hope

4665.21 --> 4669.32
they appreciate what I'm doing though

4666.8 --> 4677.6900000000005
it's maybe a little bit too spiritual

4669.32 --> 4680.24
for some of them yeah and I think you

4677.69 --> 4681.95
know some people are gonna like that

4680.24 --> 4684.0199999999995
like you say but some people will and

4681.95 --> 4688.36
it's really just you know do what you do

4684.02 --> 4691.88
don't you like and you know who cares

4688.36 --> 4693.349999999999
indeed but hey I got a I got a drop I've

4691.88 --> 4695.33
got a work meeting in about five minutes

4693.35 --> 4696.410000000001
I gotta get ready for it so alright yeah

4695.33 --> 4698.92
thanks for coming man

4696.41 --> 4704.559
all right man let's go see it was good

4698.92 --> 4713.1990000000005
yep yeah I I say

4704.559 --> 4714.67
like I'm just pointing out that I okay

4713.199 --> 4716.678999999999
this is weird I was in the middle of

4714.67 --> 4719.53
saying something and I completely lost

4716.679 --> 4725.889
track so I have no idea what I wanted to

4719.53 --> 4729.13
say but oh yeah did the whole spiritual
