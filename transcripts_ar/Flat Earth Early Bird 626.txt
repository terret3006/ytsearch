who knows if i can hold out that long

123.36 --> 127.36
because it

124.0 --> 129.92
i don't know it's really hot it's also a

127.36 --> 132.879
lot more moist i think

129.92 --> 132.879
wait let me show you

139.28 --> 147.36
right so

142.319 --> 151.11999999999998
yeah as you can see not super blue

147.36 --> 157.59900000000002
it's more like a yeah

151.12 --> 159.44
a light blue whitish haze

157.599 --> 161.11999999999998
and yeah this sun is still coming

159.44 --> 163.84
through there and

161.12 --> 165.59900000000002
well right now it's almost wind still

163.84 --> 168.879
it's really unpleasant actually

165.599 --> 170.0
it it there was a little bit more wind

168.879 --> 171.84
earlier today hope

170.0 --> 173.68
there will be some more because this is

171.84 --> 176.239
not nice

173.68 --> 176.239
in this heat

178.48 --> 185.04
anyway i still got my fan

181.76 --> 189.04
hasn't been reclaimed yet

185.04 --> 193.44
probably gonna turn that on uh anyway

189.04 --> 196.239
yeah so i'm not gonna have green tea

193.44 --> 197.92
or tamara coffee for a while like at all

196.239 --> 199.519
with this type of heat it's just not

197.92 --> 202.72
healthy

199.519 --> 206.4
but i do have a lot of other drinks so

202.72 --> 209.76
for one i got a ah i remembered i have a

206.4 --> 210.239
ice cooling thingy well it's almost

209.76 --> 213.67999999999998
melted

210.239 --> 216.48000000000002
now and in it i have something that i

213.68 --> 216.48000000000002
tried out it's

216.879 --> 223.76
green tea with lemongrass in it

220.4 --> 227.84
never tried that before and yes

223.76 --> 227.84
it's interesting

230.48 --> 233.67999999999998
it is really refreshing

234.239 --> 237.84
so that's good it's not something to

235.92 --> 240.879
completely go

237.84 --> 243.92000000000002
up all at once so i restocked on my

240.879 --> 244.959
special formula two thirds water one

243.92 --> 248.07999999999998
third of that

244.959 --> 250.48
special fruit juice so i got a lot more

248.08 --> 250.48000000000002
of that

252.84 --> 258.239
great perfect because i had like

255.439 --> 260.479
a water bottle in the cooler i had this

258.239 --> 260.479
one

260.88 --> 263.919
so when i got the juice i just poured it

262.88 --> 266.0
in there and then

263.919 --> 267.03999999999996
put the ice cold water with it so it's

266.0 --> 270.72
really

267.04 --> 273.36
cold cold is good

270.72 --> 274.24
right also got an an apple and a

273.36 --> 282.40000000000003

tom parker stasmaretz

326.32 --> 335.919
purple rockstar yeah good to see you all

330.96 --> 335.919
on this hot windless

336.84 --> 342.88
tuesday

338.56 --> 345.28000000000003
all right so i did make a couple of

342.88 --> 345.28
notes

349.6 --> 352.8
right but yeah yesterday was just a

351.84 --> 355.28
weird

352.8 --> 356.40000000000003
weird monday because yeah there was no

355.28 --> 359.11999999999995
flat debates

356.4 --> 360.4
i had a very long show and went really

359.12 --> 363.52
well

360.4 --> 367.84
i got bit angry though at the end

363.52 --> 367.84
but in retrospect i think that yeah

368.8 --> 374.8
it's like it unnerves me a bit but

372.08 --> 378.4
that's really what i think

374.8 --> 381.039
and i'm not like

378.4 --> 382.08
yeah i don't know what to do with it yet

381.039 --> 384.08
you know i don't

382.08 --> 385.84
i don't completely understand for

384.08 --> 388.31899999999996
example the intricate situation

385.84 --> 390.15999999999997
in australia like how much is real how

388.319 --> 390.88
much is crisis act because there has

390.16 --> 394.319
been

390.88 --> 396.639
crisis acting going on as well

394.319 --> 399.199
so but yeah it just pisses me off and

396.639 --> 402.0
the idea the upfront idea of just

399.199 --> 402.96000000000004
closing down everything during the day

402.0 --> 406.4
even is just

402.96 --> 410.71999999999997
that's just maniacal and it

406.4 --> 413.52
was yeah it requires a uh

410.72 --> 416.0
an equal and opposite response to

413.52 --> 419.039
balance that out

416.0 --> 419.039
so anyway uh

420.84 --> 427.84
yeah i hope uh

423.84 --> 427.84
drunken bullet is still okay

428.08 --> 433.35999999999996
he was very uh generous yesterday with

430.72 --> 433.36
the paypal

434.479 --> 439.84
i hope he's doing okay today might have

437.68 --> 442.72
a bit of a hangover

439.84 --> 442.71999999999997
anyway uh

443.68 --> 447.36
right no flat earth debates

449.36 --> 453.759
or some premieres though good premieres

452.319 --> 458.8
whoa

453.759 --> 458.8
it's my video glitching what is that

461.36 --> 467.28000000000003
watching on youtube and seems like

464.4 --> 470.479
the video is glitching or something am i

467.28 --> 470.479
is anybody else seeing that

476.84 --> 482.63899999999995
huh

479.759 --> 484.72
all right oh yeah i also watched your

482.639 --> 487.28000000000003
video good servant with tom parker that

484.72 --> 490.08000000000004
show i watched that

487.28 --> 490.08
was a good listen

491.599 --> 495.12
it was really when i was just listening

493.68 --> 496.639
to it in the background though it was

495.12 --> 499.71
really hot and was just

496.639 --> 502.87
arranging some stuff here

499.71 --> 502.87
[Music]

504.0 --> 509.599
right also iron works i watched that

506.639 --> 509.599
live the whole thing

511.039 --> 517.76
all right thanks obermuckel glad just me

514.56 --> 520.8
uh and was temporary

517.76 --> 524.08
just that seemed like

520.8 --> 527.1999999999999
like as i was moving it just hampered

524.08 --> 527.2
i don't know uh

527.76 --> 531.68
yeah i did watch iron works this morning

529.68 --> 534.399
as well and that was pretty good show

531.68 --> 535.519
was there from the start this time

534.399 --> 539.2
finally

535.519 --> 541.839
yeah good show uh

539.2 --> 542.6400000000001
and yesterday i i managed to get myself

541.839 --> 545.839
to finish

542.64 --> 548.24
glitch last two episodes but it is kind

545.839 --> 550.72
of like almost what i was expecting

548.24 --> 552.64
and that it's it was quite a depressing

550.72 --> 555.6
end i thought

552.64 --> 557.68
like that was kind of a bummer so yeah

555.6 --> 559.2
now i know why i postponed that for so

557.68 --> 563.8389999999999
long

559.2 --> 563.839
overall still a very interesting series

564.16 --> 568.0799999999999
with some good character acting and some

566.399 --> 571.12
heavy dilemmas

568.08 --> 571.12
morally and all that

572.08 --> 578.24
uh yeah hi bye bye literally literalist

575.279 --> 578.24
good to see you paula

582.32 --> 587.0400000000001
oh also yesterday i finally managed to

585.279 --> 589.2
make my spaghetti

587.04 --> 590.959
i only postponed it for two days i'm

589.2 --> 592.8000000000001
very glad because if i postpone it

590.959 --> 594.4799999999999
another day it it would probably start

592.8 --> 597.4399999999999
to spoil you know in this heat even if

594.48 --> 600.72
you keep it in the cooler it's just

597.44 --> 600.72
it's not a good time to

601.76 --> 605.8389999999999
to leave your vegetables just lying

604.399 --> 608.8
around

605.839 --> 608.8000000000001
even if they are cold

609.36 --> 612.64
but that was great i have a lot of

610.72 --> 616.32
spaghetti now and

612.64 --> 619.8389999999999
yeah that was very enjoyable

616.32 --> 619.839
and nutritious

620.399 --> 625.12
and i got more for the next three days

622.8 --> 625.12
at least

626.079 --> 633.04
so that's always the nice the upside of

630.839 --> 646.0
it

633.04 --> 648.48
uh right

646.0 --> 648.48
what else

652.24 --> 656.8
i i know there have have been more

655.2 --> 661.839
streams out there

656.8 --> 661.8389999999999
but i forgot which ones

669.12 --> 675.12
you know and yeah besides like i glance

672.16 --> 677.04
over a lot of things so typically if

675.12 --> 678.399
jaron streams i tend to always like

677.04 --> 679.92
click on him

678.399 --> 681.92
and just to see what he's going to be

679.92 --> 683.5999999999999
talking about or like what it's like

681.92 --> 687.04
again just to sample it but

683.6 --> 687.0400000000001
i don't hang around too long

687.839 --> 692.0
i know probably a lot of those people

690.079 --> 694.4799999999999
have the same thing towards me

692.0 --> 696.079
they're just gonna like test like oh

694.48 --> 700.0
what's arwen like now

696.079 --> 700.0
what's he talking about something

700.839 --> 705.6800000000001
technical

702.88 --> 707.6
but yeah it takes a special kind of

705.68 --> 710.8
breed and our wind follower to

707.6 --> 711.8100000000001
really like watching me all throughout

710.8 --> 714.24
what i do

711.81 --> 717.8389999999999
[Music]

714.24 --> 717.839
and it's not for everyone

719.2 --> 724.72
vincent rhodes is a flat earther who is

722.48 --> 724.72
that

725.12 --> 731.839
i don't know who that is good servant

734.48 --> 739.04
uh anyway

740.48 --> 746.399
ah seems the wind is picking up a little

742.72 --> 746.399
at least outside that's good

747.6 --> 749.839
nice

752.0 --> 759.839
okay here's some preacher right

760.32 --> 763.36
african american man he's a flat earther

762.959 --> 767.5999999999999
okay

763.36 --> 770.639
cool that's very interesting i'm i'm

767.6 --> 772.72
really curious to see

770.639 --> 774.16
what well for example i guess my

772.72 --> 776.0
position

774.16 --> 778.079
and some other flat earthers that i

776.0 --> 780.959
sympathize a lot with like for example

778.079 --> 784.399
my literalists like how that will

780.959 --> 784.399
resonate on into the

784.839 --> 788.9590000000001
yeah the bigger

789.12 --> 794.24
priests and churches especially in

791.76 --> 794.24
america

795.279 --> 800.0
now will it cat will they realize like

798.32 --> 802.48
what had happened

800.0 --> 804.639
how they've been tricked how that works

802.48 --> 804.639
and

805.44 --> 810.5600000000001
or will they just keep ignoring it keep

808.24 --> 812.16
on going with the system

810.56 --> 815.8389999999999
because it's gonna bring them to some

812.16 --> 815.8389999999999
really crazy [ __ ]

826.839 --> 829.839
anyway

840.839 --> 843.839
hmm

848.56 --> 850.88
all right

853.68 --> 860.56
i'm gonna turn on the fan for a sec

857.279 --> 860.56
it's super noisy but

861.6 --> 871.839
especially for the face it's really uh

878.86 --> 881.96
[Music]

889.68 --> 896.4799999999999
ah yeah that helps ah i should have

892.24 --> 896.48
gotten a foot bath as well but i forgot

896.56 --> 900.7199999999999
i already had so many drinks and stuff

906.32 --> 912.399

yeah of course they're ignoring the

937.839 --> 941.839
blacks one

944.079 --> 948.2399999999999
what else can they do can't do anything

946.24 --> 952.16
about it

948.24 --> 954.0790000000001
can just yeah

952.16 --> 956.48
draw the attention away from the black

954.079 --> 956.4799999999999
swan

962.88 --> 966.88
ah good to hear drunken balls pronoun

964.639 --> 966.88
one

994.48 --> 1000.8000000000001
let's see what was i

997.68 --> 1004.079
now i often also just check out

1000.8 --> 1005.12
yeah more regular news channels or alex

1004.079 --> 1010.399
jones

1005.12 --> 1012.5600000000001
these types of things but then

1010.399 --> 1015.92
i rarely make notes because some of it

1012.56 --> 1015.92
is just so blatant it's

1016.32 --> 1021.0400000000001
oh yeah the weird situation with shots

1019.04 --> 1024.319
being fired

1021.04 --> 1028.48
and president trump is just easily

1024.319 --> 1032.319
walking off stage to the back that thing

1028.48 --> 1033.919
don't know might have happened

1032.319 --> 1035.36
but in a sense that yeah i don't know

1033.919 --> 1036.72
maybe it was like a nut case or

1035.36 --> 1038.8799999999999
something i've heard i don't know i

1036.72 --> 1041.52
haven't really looked into it

1038.88 --> 1044.7990000000002
it seems a little overblown but yeah

1041.52 --> 1046.48
with all the insanity going out there

1044.799 --> 1049.76
it's not surprising that there isn't

1046.48 --> 1052.32
like an overreaction to such a thing

1049.76 --> 1053.6
even though i didn't think that like the

1052.32 --> 1056.72
president or his

1053.6 --> 1058.0
security queue or crew were overreacting

1056.72 --> 1061.6000000000001
or anything but

1058.0 --> 1062.88
just everyone else maybe and all the

1061.6 --> 1067.84
mask wearing

1062.88 --> 1067.8400000000001
god it's just everywhere

1080.64 --> 1083.5200000000002
is it again

1083.84 --> 1089.84
it is this like also a thing a situation

1088.16 --> 1091.8400000000001
in germany apparently would have just

1089.84 --> 1094.08
read one article

1091.84 --> 1095.6
and you know yeah an article what is

1094.08 --> 1097.76
that these days

1095.6 --> 1100.799
can mean anything it can just be a

1097.76 --> 1104.0
speaking point or a

1100.799 --> 1109.84
like a nudge but i don't know

1104.0 --> 1112.48
it's probably real but apparently

1109.84 --> 1113.9189999999999
yeah in this recording let me let me

1112.48 --> 1116.88
just check it out

1113.919 --> 1120.3200000000002
again what is it source it does have a

1116.88 --> 1123.8400000000001
lot of links it has a video

1120.32 --> 1123.84
uh let's see

1124.4 --> 1131.44
oh all right

1127.76 --> 1134.799
it's on facebook on a melt pins

1131.44 --> 1134.799
whatever that yeah it's like

1134.84 --> 1141.1999999999998
uh a reporting uh

1138.0 --> 1142.48
node i guess it will translate it in

1141.2 --> 1144.64
english

1142.48 --> 1145.679
that's the source but it says basically

1144.64 --> 1149.3600000000001
that

1145.679 --> 1153.039
children in germany that don't

1149.36 --> 1156.3999999999999
live up to the quarantine will be

1153.039 --> 1158.24
basically isolated in yeah

1156.4 --> 1160.16
away from everyone including their

1158.24 --> 1166.08
parents

1160.16 --> 1166.0800000000002
or not they will basic what is it

1168.4 --> 1172.0800000000002
yeah in what do you call it in a closed

1171.12 --> 1174.32
institution

1172.08 --> 1178.08
whatever that means sounds really [ __ ]

1174.32 --> 1181.2
up can't be good

1178.08 --> 1184.48
and the parents risk

1181.2 --> 1188.0
fine or prison time it's so

1184.48 --> 1190.4
absurd like yeah these things man

1188.0 --> 1191.76
it's almost the similar thing as the

1190.4 --> 1194.64
australian situation

1191.76 --> 1196.16
but this is just being said that's a

1194.64 --> 1198.72
difference you know in australia

1196.16 --> 1201.52
they are mistreating people right now

1198.72 --> 1201.52
it's on video

1202.64 --> 1206.7990000000002
but apparently they're trying to push

1204.4 --> 1208.72
this now in germany or it's already been

1206.799 --> 1209.12
initiated i'm not entirely clear about

1208.72 --> 1211.52
it

1209.12 --> 1214.1589999999999
but it's really messed up man this is

1211.52 --> 1214.1589999999999
just so

1218.84 --> 1221.84
bad

1232.84 --> 1237.36
so

1234.7 --> 1239.919
[Music]

1237.36 --> 1240.6399999999999
and yeah also a lot of it is really up

1239.919 --> 1243.8400000000001
to

1240.64 --> 1245.44
all the police you know like what is the

1243.84 --> 1250.32
police like

1245.44 --> 1250.3200000000002
in these countries i can barely imagine

1255.039 --> 1263.84
that they would just do that

1267.44 --> 1272.72
i don't know it just smells of severe

1269.76 --> 1272.72
corruption or

1272.96 --> 1280.0
blackmail or something like that just

1277.679 --> 1281.039
who the hell would become a police

1280.0 --> 1284.24
officer

1281.039 --> 1289.28
and then do that to their own people

1284.24 --> 1289.28
i don't get it i don't get it

1289.36 --> 1297.28
why aren't the police force

1293.2 --> 1300.0
themselves basically how do you say that

1297.28 --> 1301.52
not striking because that's crazy that

1300.0 --> 1305.2
didn't these times

1301.52 --> 1308.48
but like why don't they just

1305.2 --> 1312.48
disobey to just say like

1308.48 --> 1314.64
no no we're not gonna do that

1312.48 --> 1316.4
we are gonna perform the function that

1314.64 --> 1320.159
is

1316.4 --> 1323.76
yeah basically designated to the police

1320.159 --> 1325.7600000000002
as a self-reliant thing that they do

1323.76 --> 1327.039
we're not going to be politicized we're

1325.76 --> 1329.84
not going to be driven by

1327.039 --> 1329.84
some weird

1330.4 --> 1334.4
authoritarian agenda like that gonna

1333.2 --> 1336.48
perform the duties

1334.4 --> 1338.88
that we're supposed to be performing as

1336.48 --> 1341.52
police officers

1338.88 --> 1342.3200000000002
uh yeah i don't know is that maybe

1341.52 --> 1347.84
that's

1342.32 --> 1347.84
so last century or something i it's

1353.28 --> 1361.84
too ta busy taking the knee god

1357.2 --> 1361.8400000000001
but is it really that are they just all

1364.32 --> 1368.6399999999999
yeah talking to the authoritarian

1366.96 --> 1375.8400000000001
machine

1368.64 --> 1375.8400000000001
the money power and all that and i

1386.84 --> 1389.84
so

1393.679 --> 1397.2800000000002
not enough are awake but do you think

1396.64 --> 1400.8400000000001
really that

1397.28 --> 1403.84
like the police in themselves are not

1400.84 --> 1403.84
awake

1404.64 --> 1407.8400000000001
that doesn't make any sense they must

1406.64 --> 1410.96
know

1407.84 --> 1411.28
they're freaking police that's what you

1410.96 --> 1414.64
do

1411.28 --> 1416.6399999999999
as police you figure out what's going on

1414.64 --> 1418.96
figure out when people are trying to

1416.64 --> 1420.64
pull something

1418.96 --> 1422.0
you know you figure it that's what

1420.64 --> 1424.3200000000002
police have

1422.0 --> 1427.679
instincts and training for it makes no

1424.32 --> 1427.6789999999999
sense they have to know

1428.32 --> 1433.039
so that's why i say either they're just

1430.159 --> 1433.0390000000002
blackmailed or

1435.44 --> 1439.279
i don't know driven to madness or

1442.84 --> 1445.84
something

1446.72 --> 1450.96
all right here we go again yeah i did

1448.32 --> 1450.96
hear that

1455.039 --> 1460.64
so yeah basically if

1458.159 --> 1463.0390000000002
if that is really the predominant

1460.64 --> 1465.3600000000001
influence that is causing this police

1463.039 --> 1467.52
response everywhere

1465.36 --> 1468.8799999999999
then isn't it just blatantly obvious

1467.52 --> 1472.279
that that

1468.88 --> 1473.44
type of profiling for police should

1472.279 --> 1476.64
absolutely

1473.44 --> 1479.8400000000001
be banned just whatever

1476.64 --> 1482.5590000000002
that pro that program is erase it erase

1479.84 --> 1484.84
it don't allow that ever to be used

1482.559 --> 1489.52
again like that just

1484.84 --> 1493.1999999999998
keep the more classical system

1489.52 --> 1493.2
maybe tinker on it but this is

1498.84 --> 1503.12
ridiculous

1500.64 --> 1506.24
yeah i guess that maybe it's just the

1503.12 --> 1508.32
weakness of character

1506.24 --> 1515.44
is there to make them more vulnerable to

1508.32 --> 1518.0
political influence

1515.44 --> 1519.8400000000001
and that that's why they have it that's

1518.0 --> 1523.919
what they're counting on maybe

1519.84 --> 1529.84
it's the auto [ __ ] mechan machine

1523.919 --> 1529.8400000000001
as it were auto [ __ ]

1536.32 --> 1539.36
but yeah if that is really the case then

1538.64 --> 1543.1200000000001
it's

1539.36 --> 1548.3999999999999
going to be a matter of simply

1543.12 --> 1552.8799999999999
sacking the police staff and recruiting

1548.4 --> 1555.2
better start recruiting already you know

1552.88 --> 1557.679
figure out who would actually make a

1555.2 --> 1560.72
good police police

1557.679 --> 1562.24
in a yeah in in the tough world that it

1560.72 --> 1562.88
would probably start out with but it

1562.24 --> 1565.6
would

1562.88 --> 1567.44
be able to restore if everybody nobody

1565.6 --> 1568.7199999999998
corrupts is nobody's sneaking in there

1567.44 --> 1570.3200000000002
and just

1568.72 --> 1572.72
doing the whole [ __ ] over again or

1570.32 --> 1572.72
something

1573.2 --> 1577.1200000000001
and yeah sack the whole just the whole

1576.32 --> 1580.24
force

1577.12 --> 1582.0
just get them out or just set them all

1580.24 --> 1585.52
behind desks or i don't know

1582.0 --> 1589.36
how whatever would work and and get some

1585.52 --> 1589.36
real police force in there

1594.0 --> 1598.08
yeah and while you're at it investigate

1596.159 --> 1599.7600000000002
uh investigate the police chiefs and

1598.08 --> 1603.52
what they're up to and

1599.76 --> 1606.8799999999999
yeah bet you there's going to be a whole

1603.52 --> 1612.4
crap load of horror skeletons coming out

1606.88 --> 1615.2
of the closets you couldn't believe

1612.4 --> 1627.8400000000001
that's probably this is unbelievable

1615.2 --> 1627.8400000000001
like everywhere

1638.88 --> 1645.0390000000002
tribulation is coming right

1642.799 --> 1645.039
well

1646.399 --> 1650.799
there's certainly yeah look there are

1648.64 --> 1652.48
just things going on

1650.799 --> 1654.6399999999999
they're working in a certain way and

1652.48 --> 1656.159
everybody can feel there is just natural

1654.64 --> 1658.88
consequences to it

1656.159 --> 1660.48
you can hide from it or you can figure

1658.88 --> 1663.0390000000002
it out

1660.48 --> 1665.3600000000001
and hey if you figure it out you can

1663.039 --> 1668.559
potentially even see

1665.36 --> 1670.8799999999999
how you can smoothen things out how you

1668.559 --> 1675.12
can lessen the damage

1670.88 --> 1675.1200000000001
on the pure for example

1675.6 --> 1680.8799999999999
like how can we undo so much of the

1678.159 --> 1684.0
cocking it's exactly the cocking that's

1680.88 --> 1686.3990000000001
it's probably the cocking the the

1684.0 --> 1689.6
cultural normalization of it

1686.399 --> 1692.4799999999998
that has caused the most damage of

1689.6 --> 1694.9599999999998
everything because a lot of the cocking

1692.48 --> 1698.48
happens when nobody's looking

1694.96 --> 1698.48
when it's really important

1699.039 --> 1703.44
right you know all the the perversion

1702.32 --> 1706.08
and [ __ ] it's it's

1703.44 --> 1708.159
yeah it's not good it's and it's so in

1706.08 --> 1711.1999999999998
your face and all that and that's

1708.159 --> 1714.3200000000002
it's revolting but

1711.2 --> 1715.8400000000001
you know at least it it can be easily

1714.32 --> 1718.559
recognized well the whole

1715.84 --> 1720.9599999999998
cocking invasion of the spirit

1718.559 --> 1725.36
everywhere in the west and all that

1720.96 --> 1728.24
that it does much more damage

1725.36 --> 1729.6789999999999
yeah cocking is just it's the it's

1728.24 --> 1732.08
technically a sexual

1729.679 --> 1733.3600000000001
thing but i don't mean like it's it's

1732.08 --> 1737.279
basically

1733.36 --> 1740.9599999999998
taking a knee just to something

1737.279 --> 1742.0
that is really wrong it comes down to

1740.96 --> 1745.52
like oh

1742.0 --> 1746.159
yeah your wife is a [ __ ] and she wants

1745.52 --> 1748.1589999999999
to be

1746.159 --> 1749.7600000000002
screwed by another man and you're like

1748.159 --> 1753.2
oh i love you so much

1749.76 --> 1755.59
sure that's basically falls under

1753.2 --> 1757.3600000000001
cocking

1755.59 --> 1759.6789999999999
[Music]

1757.36 --> 1763.12
nathan's having a premiere so it seems

1759.679 --> 1763.1200000000001
he's not having a live show

1774.88 --> 1782.3990000000001
all right even you

1779.36 --> 1785.6789999999999
but uh yeah the

1782.399 --> 1788.9599999999998
the just this surrenderism to bad

1785.679 --> 1791.8400000000001
things into desperation to

1788.96 --> 1793.44
giving up also it is really in a way

1791.84 --> 1796.399
aromatic

1793.44 --> 1796.72
it's so much driven by depression and

1796.399 --> 1800.4799999999998
just

1796.72 --> 1804.48
hopelessness and spite

1800.48 --> 1808.08
bitterness and it's it's pure gamma

1804.48 --> 1811.039
the energy of it

1808.08 --> 1812.799
yeah and if you're drawn into that a lot

1811.039 --> 1815.6
and you're conditioned

1812.799 --> 1816.799
from that position socially which kind

1815.6 --> 1819.9189999999999
of happens naturally

1816.799 --> 1822.6399999999999
it it just happens and if then the

1819.919 --> 1825.919
entire system plays into that

1822.64 --> 1827.8400000000001
and the controllers try to trick you and

1825.919 --> 1829.8400000000001
promise you all kinds of yeah that's how

1827.84 --> 1830.8799999999999
so many of these people are now in these

1829.84 --> 1832.72
positions

1830.88 --> 1835.1200000000001
doing these terrible things to their own

1832.72 --> 1835.1200000000001
people

1835.84 --> 1839.84
i wonder how many of them are
