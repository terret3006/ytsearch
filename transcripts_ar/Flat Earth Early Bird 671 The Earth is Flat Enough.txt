so

30.28 --> 37.02
[Music]

47.44 --> 53.12
good morning welcome to flat earth early

50.879 --> 55.28
bird number 671

53.12 --> 57.12
i'm your host irwin and before we start

55.28 --> 58.0
the show please don't forget to share it

57.12 --> 60.079
on any platform

58.0 --> 61.76
you deem fit and if you haven't already

60.079 --> 63.44

63.44 --> 66.39999999999999
live

64.159 --> 67.43900000000001
which is normally 2 p.m amsterdam time

66.4 --> 69.43900000000001
every day

67.439 --> 71.27999999999999
please also do support me through the

69.439 --> 73.19999999999999
paypal patreon the super chat and

71.28 --> 76.72
membership system join button

73.2 --> 76.72
that would be much appreciated

78.4 --> 83.119
the weather today is yeah

83.84 --> 90.4
it basically just stopped raining

87.119 --> 93.36
like a minute ago because

90.4 --> 95.43900000000001
yeah it's pretty damn clouded it's been

93.36 --> 97.52
like that since like 11 o'clock before

95.439 --> 101.03999999999999
that again it was kind of okay

97.52 --> 102.399
a bit of sun here and there like the sun

101.04 --> 105.60000000000001
even hit

102.399 --> 110.159
hit me when i woke up

105.6 --> 110.15899999999999
but now it's just doof so

115.36 --> 121.92
cloudy gray and lots of rain sometimes

120.159 --> 125.43900000000001
it's kind of cold well that's why i'm

121.92 --> 125.43900000000001
wearing a sweater as well so

126.799 --> 131.52
it's still raining over there roger i

128.879 --> 131.51999999999998
bet it is

133.12 --> 138.87900000000002
right so anyway uh roger was first rob h

136.239 --> 142.08
good servant friend m stopping

138.879 --> 144.72
trafficking arrest ahead good to see you

142.08 --> 144.72
so far

146.4 --> 149.52
oh mr jones

151.12 --> 154.4
it's a cloudy day on your on your globe

153.599 --> 157.599
earth model

154.4 --> 160.64000000000001
that's nice can you explain to me how

157.599 --> 163.83999999999997
those clouds can stick around this

160.64 --> 163.83999999999997
in the open container

164.64 --> 168.48
shouldn't the clouds basically be

166.4 --> 173.04
carried off by the

168.48 --> 173.04
constantly expanding gas pressure

178.0 --> 181.44
well the clouds probably wouldn't even

180.879 --> 184.39999999999998
become

181.44 --> 186.48
clouds if the gas was still expanding it

184.4 --> 189.76000000000002
would just stay in vapor form because it

186.48 --> 190.159
couldn't find the conditions to turn

189.76 --> 194.56
back

190.159 --> 194.56
into water droplets

195.12 --> 200.48000000000002
all right uh a tiny wombo

202.159 --> 208.72
indian rainy in the uk yeah sure i bet

205.92 --> 208.72
i bet it is

209.599 --> 215.67999999999998
anyway yeah i had a very

212.959 --> 217.84
very insanely late night last night i

215.68 --> 221.20000000000002
think it was like five o'clock

217.84 --> 226.0
it's not not good like late

221.2 --> 229.44
very very late uh

226.0 --> 231.76
was a lot of fun things going on

229.44 --> 231.76
uh

234.159 --> 237.67999999999998
right the flat earth debate yesterday

236.48 --> 242.48
lasted

237.68 --> 245.68
very long as far as i remember

242.48 --> 245.67999999999998
it was pretty intense

246.64 --> 252.95899999999997
uh what was it another episode of ed

249.68 --> 256.479
and a little bit of chaky too

252.959 --> 260.239
last very long the after show at least

256.479 --> 260.239
one one and a half hours i think

264.4 --> 271.75899999999996
and right another thing that happened

269.36 --> 273.52000000000004
was yeah the continuation of this the

271.759 --> 276.32
space crack

273.52 --> 277.35999999999996
from rodrigo ferrari nunes he's

276.32 --> 279.759
continued his

277.36 --> 281.199
disney episode as it were very

279.759 --> 284.88
interesting

281.199 --> 284.88
stuff was good to be there in chat

288.56 --> 294.24
yeah and owen benjamin was live too

295.04 --> 299.12
and that was just yeah great stuff as

297.36 --> 302.8
usual

299.12 --> 306.24
uh more of the basics though you know

302.8 --> 309.28000000000003
owen he does just talk about

306.24 --> 312.40000000000003
bertaria fruit not blood and

309.28 --> 313.67999999999995
yeah from that perspective there is so

312.4 --> 318.0
much to say

313.68 --> 320.639
to constantly yeah affirm that

318.0 --> 322.24
and he's doing that basically and yeah i

320.639 --> 325.919
appreciate that

322.24 --> 328.639
it really pulls me towards

325.919 --> 330.479
that attitude to just hang around there

328.639 --> 332.88
and i like that

330.479 --> 335.59999999999997
it also distracts me from yeah some of

332.88 --> 335.6
my inner

336.84 --> 342.0
issues

338.56 --> 345.199
so it helps me pull away from that

342.0 --> 348.4
to just be part of that

345.199 --> 352.08000000000004
big bear chat it's good stuff

348.4 --> 355.35999999999996
oh yeah and oh yeah this time

352.08 --> 358.479
he put the ira [ __ ] his pants

355.36 --> 362.96000000000004
uh sound bite

358.479 --> 367.28
over nadler like wiggling away on stage

362.96 --> 371.59999999999997
oh god i shut my face oh jesus

367.28 --> 373.919
and that was just oh my god that was so

371.6 --> 373.91900000000004
funny

375.6 --> 379.12
that was yeah big bear definitely called

378.24 --> 382.16
it on that one

379.12 --> 385.28000000000003
even the way kind of he looks he's he is

382.16 --> 385.28000000000003
the modern day ira

386.639 --> 393.28000000000003
yeah so if you haven't seen that that's

390.08 --> 396.15999999999997
that's very worthwhile watching just for

393.28 --> 396.15999999999997
that clip load

401.44 --> 404.56
oh well thank you mr jones i appreciate

403.919 --> 407.28
that

404.56 --> 409.039
yeah i get default down votes it always

407.28 --> 412.71999999999997
happens but

409.039 --> 415.039
yeah there's this weird thing going on i

412.72 --> 415.68
think that i got standard down votes and

415.039 --> 419.039
every time

415.68 --> 423.84000000000003
somebody even up votes automatically a

419.039 --> 423.84
downfall discounted on top of that see

423.919 --> 429.19899999999996
oh they're 11. oh they're filing it on

427.599 --> 431.199
right now

429.199 --> 432.40000000000003
they're making their presence known oh

431.199 --> 436.96000000000004
we can do

432.4 --> 440.0
we can passively resist by anonymously

436.96 --> 440.96
rigging the system to downvote this

440.0 --> 443.28
youtuber

440.96 --> 444.15999999999997
because we don't like it we don't like

443.28 --> 447.84
it

444.16 --> 450.8
how well our wind breaks

447.84 --> 452.23999999999995
the globe delusion we don't like it we

450.8 --> 456.479
don't like that he's still

452.24 --> 458.72
free to then move beyond and start

456.479 --> 460.639
figuring out the cosmogeny of the realm

458.72 --> 461.52000000000004
and all the possibilities that are still

460.639 --> 463.52
left

461.52 --> 464.87899999999996
which are very different from what is

463.52 --> 467.44
required

464.879 --> 469.44
if you really think the earth would be a

467.44 --> 472.16
globe

469.44 --> 475.12
right so they don't like that and yeah

472.16 --> 478.96000000000004
they want to do that

475.12 --> 480.879
they want to emphasize that

478.96 --> 482.23999999999995
the anonymous part is very important to

480.879 --> 493.759
them

482.24 --> 495.52
because it's just too scary

493.759 --> 496.879
right so what do you guys thought about

495.52 --> 498.479
my ass

496.879 --> 500.47900000000004
hangout yesterday i thought it was

498.479 --> 504.15999999999997
really intense

500.479 --> 506.8
i didn't watch it back but i should

504.16 --> 508.08000000000004
yeah i don't know why i didn't because

506.8 --> 510.96000000000004
it was very

508.08 --> 512.4789999999999
very detailed i expanded upon the

510.96 --> 515.76
looping possibilities

512.479 --> 519.9190000000001
try to explain how it would be like

515.76 --> 521.12
what the options could be and even

519.919 --> 523.919
theorized a little

521.12 --> 525.839
speculate a little about then yeah what

523.919 --> 528.64
actually

525.839 --> 530.8800000000001
could be regulating the loop and how it

528.64 --> 535.8389999999999
ties in with everything else

530.88 --> 535.8389999999999
potentially if it were to be there

539.279 --> 544.56
what no evidence for flat earth well the

541.519 --> 547.92
evidence is all there

544.56 --> 549.4399999999999
i have provided evidence i or basically

547.92 --> 552.3199999999999
pointed it out

549.44 --> 554.6400000000001
you can see too far at too low a viewer

552.32 --> 554.6400000000001
point

555.36 --> 559.92
yeah whatever the earth may be in

557.68 --> 563.3599999999999
totality whatever the realm is

559.92 --> 566.0799999999999
everything that we can see

563.36 --> 569.279
from any perspective reveals itself to

566.08 --> 569.279
be perfectly flat

569.92 --> 577.92
and it's not just saying black swan

573.92 --> 580.0799999999999
and hey just black swan

577.92 --> 581.76
it is basically pointing out yeah the

580.08 --> 584.08
geometry

581.76 --> 587.12
doesn't match up with what we see you

584.08 --> 589.76
can see too far that shouldn't happen

587.12 --> 590.5600000000001
on a globe because of the geometrical

589.76 --> 593.04
horizon

590.56 --> 595.68
which would have to naturally be there

593.04 --> 598.8
but the horizon that we do see

595.68 --> 599.279
in most cases and even if just one but

598.8 --> 602.8
in

599.279 --> 605.68
most cases doesn't match up with

602.8 --> 607.4399999999999
what the geometrical horizon would have

605.68 --> 610.8
to be on the globe

607.44 --> 614.0790000000001
so yeah we can see too far at too

610.8 --> 616.4799999999999
low a viewer height that's a

614.079 --> 617.76
telltale sign that the earth is not a

616.48 --> 621.6
globe

617.76 --> 625.2
but is flat or

621.6 --> 627.0400000000001
maybe very very very very very minutely

625.2 --> 630.48
slightly curved which would not

627.04 --> 634.0
match whatsoever whatsoever

630.48 --> 635.76
with the globe geometry that's

634.0 --> 638.079
that doesn't match with the globe

635.76 --> 641.279
geometry that you guys

638.079 --> 642.88
go with with the globe which has a very

641.279 --> 646.0
specific geometry

642.88 --> 648.56
well observations don't match with that

646.0 --> 650.399
geometry that's basically what the black

648.56 --> 654.3199999999999
swan is about

650.399 --> 658.88
and the thing also is that

654.32 --> 658.88
it's not just a couple of times

659.12 --> 662.8
it doesn't matter if it's just a couple

661.68 --> 665.5999999999999
of times because

662.8 --> 666.079
it should never see that's the thing

665.6 --> 668.0790000000001
about

666.079 --> 669.1999999999999
geometrical horizon that's the thing

668.079 --> 671.92
about looking past

669.2 --> 671.9200000000001
objects

673.44 --> 677.519
you can't just have a few exceptions

678.8 --> 685.8389999999999
vision optics don't allow

682.56 --> 689.04
for round objects

685.839 --> 692.72
or curved surfaces to subtly be

689.04 --> 695.8389999999999
bent into flat that never happens

692.72 --> 699.0400000000001
through optics if anything optics

695.839 --> 702.72
may potentially distort the view

699.04 --> 706.079
to suggest some kind of short

702.72 --> 708.24
term close by curve effect

706.079 --> 709.92
that's the suggestion it's the optical

708.24 --> 712.8
slant effect it's because of

709.92 --> 715.04
diffraction the diffraction limit and

712.8 --> 718.8
the nature of eyeballs and all that

715.04 --> 721.76
and cameras how that works optics

718.8 --> 723.4399999999999
so if anything refraction optic effects

721.76 --> 725.92
may suggest

723.44 --> 728.1600000000001
a slight curve which still would not

725.92 --> 729.36
match up with any geometry of this

728.16 --> 732.88
presupposed sphere

729.36 --> 735.44
earth but

732.88 --> 735.92
it can never do the opposite it can

735.44 --> 739.12
never

735.92 --> 740.0
turn some kind of curved surface into

739.12 --> 744.9590000000001
flat

740.0 --> 749.92
that's not how optics works ever so

744.959 --> 752.959
yeah you can never see this very far

749.92 --> 753.519
at it at the low observation height on

752.959 --> 757.8389999999999
the ball

753.519 --> 759.6
that can never ever be possible

757.839 --> 761.0400000000001
anything only the opposite could be

759.6 --> 764.5600000000001
possible the ball could look

761.04 --> 768.639
even more like a small wall

764.56 --> 769.76
rather than the normal geometry it

768.639 --> 772.0790000000001
should have

769.76 --> 772.88
on a ball that is what could happen it

772.079 --> 775.1999999999999
could never

772.88 --> 777.36
look into flat and that you could see

775.2 --> 780.5600000000001
extremely far

777.36 --> 782.639
that can never happen with the optics

780.56 --> 784.16
that we've all figured out that has been

782.639 --> 787.6800000000001
established that can never

784.16 --> 791.36
happen you understand so yeah proof

787.68 --> 792.399
of flat earth well the complete absence

791.36 --> 795.6
of proof

792.399 --> 798.0
of spherical geometry is good enough

795.6 --> 801.839
indication that the earth is indeed

798.0 --> 803.92
flat flatish or flat enough

801.839 --> 807.0400000000001
how about that how about that the earth

803.92 --> 807.04
is flat enough

807.279 --> 810.8
yeah i like that i'm actually going to

809.04 --> 815.4499999999999
call this episode that

810.8 --> 820.4399999999999
the earth is flat enough

815.45 --> 820.44
[Music]

835.279 --> 839.8389999999999
now there's nothing distorted about a

837.12 --> 843.199
photo a photo is a photo

839.839 --> 846.48
and what photos can reveal is either

843.199 --> 846.959
everything exactly as is or very close

846.48 --> 851.279
to as

846.959 --> 854.8389999999999
is or it can because of diffraction

851.279 --> 858.639
effects right can

854.839 --> 861.6800000000001
suggest curvature and very

858.639 --> 862.72
close by range in ways that's often does

861.68 --> 866.079
not match the

862.72 --> 867.1990000000001
geometry of of the globe earth they can

866.079 --> 870.399
suggest

867.199 --> 872.639
that can seem like it's curving it's not

870.399 --> 872.639
though

873.6 --> 876.24
what's happening

876.639 --> 879.76
youtube was stalling

880.24 --> 886.72
hugely distorted well how how is the

883.6 --> 890.32
photo hugely distorted

886.72 --> 892.32
distortion what kind of distortion are

890.32 --> 893.9200000000001
you even talking about

892.32 --> 896.32
because it doesn't matter if it's

893.92 --> 897.279
distorted the objects are distinctly

896.32 --> 900.0
visible

897.279 --> 903.12
at a very low observation height doesn't

900.0 --> 906.24
matter how much they are distorted

903.12 --> 909.68
they are divided

906.24 --> 912.88
in view in a way that it just

909.68 --> 913.3599999999999
shows to be very flat because you could

912.88 --> 916.48
never

913.36 --> 918.5600000000001
see that far on the geometrical sphere

916.48 --> 919.76
because it would be obstructed and there

918.56 --> 924.399
is no way that

919.76 --> 926.8
optics could ever reveal anything

924.399 --> 927.76
that is stuck behind the geometrical

926.8 --> 931.5999999999999
horizon

927.76 --> 931.6
because that's not how optics works

932.0 --> 936.24
any miraging displacement refraction

934.639 --> 938.639
effects right

936.24 --> 940.0
not diffraction refraction effects can

938.639 --> 944.5600000000001
only displace

940.0 --> 947.279
visuals in relation to the horizon

944.56 --> 949.04
but things stuck behind the horizon

947.279 --> 952.16
could never be

949.04 --> 953.8389999999999
shown above the horizon

952.16 --> 955.6
because of refraction that's an

953.839 --> 959.12
impossibility if it's

955.6 --> 961.36
concealed behind a physical

959.12 --> 962.16
edge of some kind behind something

961.36 --> 965.6
physical

962.16 --> 968.399
miraging effects of any kind cannot

965.6 --> 968.88
reveal it cannot make it visible again

968.399 --> 971.199
that's

968.88 --> 971.92
physical impossibility that doesn't

971.199 --> 975.519
exist

971.92 --> 978.079
that's a myth and terrestrial

975.519 --> 978.88
refraction suggests this but terrestrial

978.079 --> 982.16
refraction

978.88 --> 985.759
is a non-optics fantasy

982.16 --> 988.8
that's also a paradox

985.759 --> 991.839
terrestrial refraction could never

988.8 --> 993.279
be part of proving the radius of earth

991.839 --> 997.839
because that

993.279 --> 997.8389999999999
would cause a paradox

1000.0 --> 1006.399
so that's very very cute that you think

1004.24 --> 1007.36
that the black swan photograph with the

1006.399 --> 1009.199
oil rigs is

1007.36 --> 1011.1990000000001
distorted it doesn't matter because

1009.199 --> 1014.4799999999999
there's only so many types of

1011.199 --> 1017.4399999999999
distortions that can happen

1014.48 --> 1018.48
and none of the distortions that could

1017.44 --> 1021.6800000000001
happen

1018.48 --> 1025.199
in visuals in optics could ever make

1021.68 --> 1029.1989999999998
an object visually

1025.199 --> 1032.959
reappear above a geometrical horizon

1029.199 --> 1039.8390000000002
where normally it is invisible

1032.959 --> 1039.8390000000002
that's impossible

1044.559 --> 1049.52
oh you got websites that claim

1046.799 --> 1052.4
terrestrial refraction do you mr jones

1049.52 --> 1056.08
well it's very nice it's very nice that

1052.4 --> 1059.44
a website claims terrestrial refraction

1056.08 --> 1059.4399999999998
it's a paradox though

1059.52 --> 1066.24
there is no terrestrial refraction

1062.559 --> 1068.24
formulaic wise without r yet terrestrial

1066.24 --> 1072.08
refraction is supposedly

1068.24 --> 1074.559
exactly that which is supposed to prove

1072.08 --> 1075.1999999999998
the radius of earth it's supposed to

1074.559 --> 1078.0
show you

1075.2 --> 1078.4
r even though r is presupposed in it so

1078.0 --> 1081.919
it's

1078.4 --> 1085.6000000000001
already mathematically paradoxical

1081.919 --> 1085.6000000000001
it's it's impossible

1086.16 --> 1089.44
terrestrial refraction could never prove

1088.72 --> 1094.08
the globe

1089.44 --> 1097.6000000000001
because it presupposes r it's impossible

1094.08 --> 1100.559
and it's not proven it's unproven optics

1097.6 --> 1102.7199999999998
it's just wild fantasy

1100.559 --> 1103.9189999999999
based on mathematical presuppositions

1102.72 --> 1106.24
the r value

1103.919 --> 1107.44
so yeah good luck with that it's

1106.24 --> 1109.76
impossible

1107.44 --> 1111.8400000000001
it doesn't matter how many websites talk

1109.76 --> 1112.72
about terrestrial fractions say it must

1111.84 --> 1115.6
be there and

1112.72 --> 1117.2
explain how it's supposed to work optics

1115.6 --> 1120.32
don't work that way

1117.2 --> 1124.799
and terrestrial refraction is a paradox

1120.32 --> 1128.0
it can't prove r it presupposes it

1124.799 --> 1129.36
and it can never prove it because it's a

1128.0 --> 1131.679
paradox

1129.36 --> 1137.84
do it do i need to repeat that a few

1131.679 --> 1137.8400000000001
more times

1145.919 --> 1152.88
ah roger scientific proof is not really

1149.28 --> 1155.6789999999999
required you know

1152.88 --> 1156.4
we don't need scientific proof to figure

1155.679 --> 1159.2
out

1156.4 --> 1161.039
how things work necessarily you can just

1159.2 --> 1164.16
observe it

1161.039 --> 1166.64
and then cross reference it with what is

1164.16 --> 1168.799
established to be possible what has been

1166.64 --> 1171.1200000000001
tested what is repeatable

1168.799 --> 1172.24
optics the optics information it just

1171.12 --> 1175.039
reveals how does

1172.24 --> 1175.919
optics work what happens every time what

1175.039 --> 1179.2
is possible

1175.919 --> 1181.6000000000001
what is not possible

1179.2 --> 1183.44
science doesn't prove things he claimed

1181.6 --> 1185.4399999999998
refraction yeah but he doesn't claim

1183.44 --> 1187.919
scientific evidence though he didn't say

1185.44 --> 1189.919
that which is very wise

1187.919 --> 1193.039
because then immediately the whole thing

1189.919 --> 1194.64
can be thrown out of the door

1193.039 --> 1196.32
doesn't have signs for terrestrial

1194.64 --> 1200.4
refraction it presupposes

1196.32 --> 1202.6399999999999
r that means that it's not provable

1200.4 --> 1204.5590000000002
just like for example the cavendish

1202.64 --> 1206.7990000000002
experiment is not an experiment because

1204.559 --> 1209.6789999999999
it presupposes gravity

1206.799 --> 1209.679
doesn't prove it

1210.96 --> 1214.72
and it's not a natural phenomenon but

1218.84 --> 1224.24
yeah

1220.48 --> 1229.1200000000001
the flat non-rotating dome earth is dead

1224.24 --> 1234.0
uh dead i don't know if it's dead

1229.12 --> 1236.2399999999998
it's definitely not proven though

1234.0 --> 1237.52
there are still presupposed elements to

1236.24 --> 1240.64
it

1237.52 --> 1243.36
and there's indications it may

1240.64 --> 1244.24
definitely not turn out to be a snow

1243.36 --> 1247.6789999999999
globe

1244.24 --> 1248.72
disc earth but we don't know that for

1247.679 --> 1250.8400000000001
sure

1248.72 --> 1252.72
but there's already like spatial

1250.84 --> 1255.4399999999998
irregularities that would put

1252.72 --> 1256.4
the literal geometrical literal snow

1255.44 --> 1258.799
globe model

1256.4 --> 1260.0
of earth it would throw that out of the

1258.799 --> 1262.72
door there's more to

1260.0 --> 1263.36
what's going on in the realm and the

1262.72 --> 1266.0
layout

1263.36 --> 1267.9189999999999
there's complexities that make the

1266.0 --> 1271.44
literal

1267.919 --> 1273.2
snow globe earth very unlikely to be

1271.44 --> 1276.64
possible

1273.2 --> 1281.44
those visuals as is

1276.64 --> 1281.44
but yet we don't know for certain

1288.0 --> 1292.88
yeah mr jones if you say science doesn't

1290.96 --> 1293.76
prove anything then you are a science

1292.88 --> 1296.4
denier

1293.76 --> 1297.919
because science proves the cause to an

1296.4 --> 1300.96
effect

1297.919 --> 1301.6000000000001
it definitely does prove something if it

1300.96 --> 1303.919
doesn't

1301.6 --> 1305.36
prove the cause of an effect then it's

1303.919 --> 1308.7990000000002
not science

1305.36 --> 1312.0
then it's just speculation it's just

1308.799 --> 1312.0
a just so story

1312.88 --> 1319.679
science definitely does prove things now

1316.84 --> 1322.48
pseudoscience globe geometry

1319.679 --> 1324.0
doesn't prove things that is that is

1322.48 --> 1328.0
correct

1324.0 --> 1329.679
but that's your science pseudoscience

1328.0 --> 1332.559
that actually doesn't prove things

1329.679 --> 1336.48
that's a correct assertion

1332.559 --> 1339.52
google it i will be surprised yeah great

1336.48 --> 1341.28
oh i'll just go by the official

1339.52 --> 1344.0
established

1341.28 --> 1344.559
facts about science that you can look up

1344.0 --> 1347.679
not on

1344.559 --> 1352.32
google and some websites you found

1347.679 --> 1352.3200000000002
but in yeah university libraries

1352.48 --> 1358.799
in big works of people that are actually

1355.679 --> 1363.3600000000001
competent physicists and not just a

1358.799 --> 1366.72
bunch of speculators with a paper

1363.36 --> 1366.7199999999998
no you can't ban the shill

1368.96 --> 1372.46
no no no it's much more effective to

1371.28 --> 1373.6789999999999
just let him

1372.46 --> 1376.48
[Music]

1373.679 --> 1376.88
throw out his assertions let me break

1376.48 --> 1379.76
them

1376.88 --> 1380.96
all every single one until he's just

1379.76 --> 1383.36
left with nothing but

1380.96 --> 1385.2
at home which is exactly what he did

1383.36 --> 1387.6
yesterday at the end of the show he just

1385.2 --> 1390.0
started ad homing because i broke every

1387.6 --> 1391.9189999999999
single argument and assertion that he

1390.0 --> 1392.96
put in chat every single one without

1391.919 --> 1396.159
exception

1392.96 --> 1398.88
and i can keep on doing that can keep

1396.159 --> 1403.1200000000001
that up for at least another

1398.88 --> 1405.1200000000001
37 minutes

1403.12 --> 1406.3999999999999
you were not there yesterday or well the

1405.12 --> 1409.28
day before

1406.4 --> 1409.2800000000002
doesn't really matter

1411.84 --> 1417.84
you've been hanging around for a while

1421.2 --> 1426.32
right roger that's right because he's a

1423.2 --> 1426.32
religious zealot

1427.76 --> 1431.44
and you know it doesn't matter he won't

1430.32 --> 1433.9189999999999
concede

1431.44 --> 1434.96
the only thing that matters is that i

1433.919 --> 1437.679
can disprove

1434.96 --> 1438.24
every assertion that he makes that is

1437.679 --> 1441.3600000000001
based

1438.24 --> 1443.279
within his religious paradigm

1441.36 --> 1444.6399999999999
if he can't get out that's not my

1443.279 --> 1447.679
problem that's his

1444.64 --> 1448.0800000000002
problem and you too should realize it's

1447.679 --> 1451.919
his

1448.08 --> 1454.0
problem you know

1451.919 --> 1455.76
we have no problem as long as they

1454.0 --> 1458.559
cannot red-hairing us

1455.76 --> 1460.96
distract us from our trains of thought

1458.559 --> 1464.24
as long as they cannot rump us us

1460.96 --> 1466.799
overtalk us it's absolutely no

1464.24 --> 1467.76
problem whether they disagree with us or

1466.799 --> 1471.44
not

1467.76 --> 1475.919
it doesn't matter because we can simply

1471.44 --> 1479.2
correct them every step of the way

1475.919 --> 1482.72
and thereby they fail visibly

1479.2 --> 1483.8400000000001
for everyone everyone that can see this

1482.72 --> 1486.24
everyone that can

1483.84 --> 1488.08
read what's going on in chat can't

1486.24 --> 1491.2
figure it out it's not that easy it's

1488.08 --> 1491.1999999999998
not that hard i mean

1491.6 --> 1496.9599999999998
unless you are

1494.72 --> 1498.32
on the globe bandwagon unless you are

1496.96 --> 1500.559
determined

1498.32 --> 1501.76
that the earth must be a globe and you

1500.559 --> 1504.3999999999999
are looking around

1501.76 --> 1506.0
to find proof for that assertion if that

1504.4 --> 1508.0800000000002
is your mindset only

1506.0 --> 1509.76
yeah then you'll not even see it but as

1508.08 --> 1512.1589999999999
long as you don't have that mindset as

1509.76 --> 1515.279
long as you're not bound by that spell

1512.159 --> 1516.96
which it is it's like a hypnotic spell

1515.279 --> 1519.76
as long as you're not bound by it you

1516.96 --> 1522.799
can see exactly what is happening

1519.76 --> 1523.2
and you can learn that people that do

1522.799 --> 1527.2
that

1523.2 --> 1530.4
are religious fanatics for their globe

1527.2 --> 1533.44
and that flat earthers like me can

1530.4 --> 1535.2
address everything they say point out

1533.44 --> 1538.72
even where it's coming from

1535.2 --> 1543.3600000000001
and then disprove it based on actual

1538.72 --> 1545.76
proven facts within physics

1543.36 --> 1546.3999999999999
yes you are religious you don't have to

1545.76 --> 1549.12
know

1546.4 --> 1551.919
your religious you don't have to even

1549.12 --> 1555.279
know what religion really is

1551.919 --> 1557.919
you can hate religion

1555.279 --> 1558.88
it doesn't make you not religious you

1557.919 --> 1560.96
are religious

1558.88 --> 1561.919
you're a religious fanatic because you

1560.96 --> 1566.48
ignore

1561.919 --> 1566.48
truth truthful presented facts

1566.799 --> 1570.0
you ignore it that makes you religious

1569.44 --> 1574.4
that is

1570.0 --> 1577.679
specifically what religion does religion

1574.4 --> 1580.0
pushes you to believe something

1577.679 --> 1582.88
even though facts are presented that

1580.0 --> 1582.88
contradict that

1582.96 --> 1586.88
that's typically what makes you

1585.279 --> 1589.84
religious

1586.88 --> 1590.96
it's not about some deity you know they

1589.84 --> 1594.08
even

1590.96 --> 1597.679
they even malformed the word

1594.08 --> 1600.3999999999999
religious by suggesting it only has to

1597.679 --> 1603.2
do with believing in a god or something

1600.4 --> 1604.0
or something supernatural yeah that's a

1603.2 --> 1608.159
distortion

1604.0 --> 1612.08
of what it really means a real religion

1608.159 --> 1614.5590000000002
is a mental process where you surrender

1612.08 --> 1616.3999999999999
to the glory of the feelings an idea

1614.559 --> 1619.279
that you really like

1616.4 --> 1620.64
and everything on top of it you go with

1619.279 --> 1623.2
those feelings

1620.64 --> 1626.64
you choose them you sacrifice your

1623.2 --> 1630.4
reason in the moment your logic

1626.64 --> 1631.8400000000001
your logos for your belief for the

1630.4 --> 1635.679
iconography

1631.84 --> 1638.399
for the symbol for

1635.679 --> 1639.039
anything that is part of the religion in

1638.399 --> 1641.4399999999998
this case

1639.039 --> 1643.12
it's a lot of globe geometry it's our

1641.44 --> 1645.679
base geometry everything

1643.12 --> 1646.799
geometrical are based that's really the

1645.679 --> 1649.279
the core of this

1646.799 --> 1650.32
specific religion you latch on to that

1649.279 --> 1654.24
and you ignore

1650.32 --> 1657.9189999999999
facts that disprove

1654.24 --> 1659.039
that your religion is true you ignore it

1657.919 --> 1662.3990000000001
you don't

1659.039 --> 1665.44
you don't throw it out and then

1662.399 --> 1669.84
counter it no you ignore it

1665.44 --> 1671.679
and you reassert the belief

1669.84 --> 1675.36
or you go at home you just start out

1671.679 --> 1675.3600000000001
attacking the person that's hurting it

1676.0 --> 1680.48
right that's what really makes you

1678.48 --> 1682.08
religious a religious fanatic

1680.48 --> 1684.159
if you keep that up for a prolonged

1682.08 --> 1688.24
period

1684.159 --> 1690.0
if you don't wake from your spell

1688.24 --> 1692.08
so it doesn't matter whether you believe

1690.0 --> 1695.12
in a god even or if you're an

1692.08 --> 1697.1999999999998
atheist or if you're an agnostic if

1695.12 --> 1700.559
you're going to believe

1697.2 --> 1703.8400000000001
in something and keep reasserting that

1700.559 --> 1706.8799999999999
and ignoring counter arguments

1703.84 --> 1709.12
that are very well worked out you don't

1706.88 --> 1711.1200000000001
respond to them you ignore it

1709.12 --> 1712.799
or you just immediately throw it out of

1711.12 --> 1715.52
the door without even

1712.799 --> 1717.12
explaining why with the logical trainer

1715.52 --> 1717.84
thought behind it no you don't go there

1717.12 --> 1720.7199999999998
anymore

1717.84 --> 1722.32
because it doesn't work because the

1720.72 --> 1724.64
rebuttals we give

1722.32 --> 1725.76
are very well worked out and thought out

1724.64 --> 1729.3600000000001
and grounded in

1725.76 --> 1729.36
actual physics and optics

1732.72 --> 1736.24
now i'm not at homing you by calling you

1735.44 --> 1739.6000000000001
religious

1736.24 --> 1740.3990000000001
unless you find religious being

1739.6 --> 1744.32
religious

1740.399 --> 1747.4399999999998
to be a personal insult

1744.32 --> 1747.4399999999998
well that's very telling

1750.48 --> 1756.159
it's just a description it's a

1752.399 --> 1756.1589999999999
description of the process

1757.52 --> 1767.84
it's a way of doing things that's what

1760.559 --> 1767.84
it is

1769.679 --> 1774.0
yeah that's right religion is a

1771.96 --> 1776.88
faith-based belief system

1774.0 --> 1778.32
exactly now you're getting it that's

1776.88 --> 1782.72
exactly what it is so

1778.32 --> 1782.72
your faith in the globe geometry

1783.039 --> 1789.039
is exactly what keeps you religious

1786.399 --> 1790.799
because every time somebody disproves it

1789.039 --> 1794.0
like i have done today

1790.799 --> 1797.2
in the last 30 minutes roughly 20

1794.0 --> 1799.52
minutes you ignore it you ignore

1797.2 --> 1801.76
every aspect you ignore how i

1799.52 --> 1804.1589999999999
elaborately described everything

1801.76 --> 1806.799
related to optics that is part of the

1804.159 --> 1809.7600000000002
observations that disproves

1806.799 --> 1810.559
the globe geometry and you ignore it so

1809.76 --> 1813.76
you are

1810.559 --> 1817.12
religious indeed you have a

1813.76 --> 1819.6
faith based belief system you believe

1817.12 --> 1820.9599999999998
in the globe geometry even though

1819.6 --> 1825.36
physical reality

1820.96 --> 1828.159
disproves it that's your religion

1825.36 --> 1828.1589999999999
do you see now

1830.559 --> 1835.039
now geometry is not evidence if physical

1833.919 --> 1837.6000000000001
reality

1835.039 --> 1838.96
proves the contrary you have no f that's

1837.6 --> 1842.799
not evidence

1838.96 --> 1846.3990000000001
that's mathematical extrapolation

1842.799 --> 1851.84
it's math-based data based on a model

1846.399 --> 1851.84
that doesn't match reality

1853.12 --> 1856.6399999999999
it's not a religion it's not faith-based

1855.44 --> 1859.919
no

1856.64 --> 1863.279
yes yes it is yes

1859.919 --> 1866.24
but keep saying no no

1863.279 --> 1866.24
that's that's all right

1869.36 --> 1872.4799999999998
math is really

1872.88 --> 1879.7600000000002
well there you go people

1876.48 --> 1883.279
the big revelation

1879.76 --> 1888.799
he believes in math he believes math

1883.279 --> 1888.799
is reality there we go isn't that just

1890.84 --> 1893.84
special

1895.34 --> 1900.6399999999999
[Music]

1896.96 --> 1905.44
oh really oh really azir lao

1900.64 --> 1905.44
aziz alau really so

1905.519 --> 1909.84
any any rebuttal to the housekeeping

1908.08 --> 1912.48
questions

1909.84 --> 1914.0
the evidence that you're supposed to

1912.48 --> 1916.3990000000001
supposed to debunk

1914.0 --> 1918.88
over and over again in face of the globe

1916.399 --> 1922.8799999999999
because it disproves it like

1918.88 --> 1925.679
where's your geometrical sphere edge

1922.88 --> 1927.1200000000001
what's your evidence for the r value how

1925.679 --> 1928.88
do you have gas pressure without a

1927.12 --> 1932.399
container

1928.88 --> 1933.679
huh what's your evidence for the molten

1932.399 --> 1936.32
iron core

1933.679 --> 1938.5590000000002
what's the distance to the sun what's

1936.32 --> 1942.96
your proof for that

1938.559 --> 1944.32
huh huh oh you globbers debunk that all

1942.96 --> 1946.24
the time

1944.32 --> 1948.08
that's why that keeps on going on the

1946.24 --> 1951.1200000000001
flat earth debates

1948.08 --> 1955.76
for several years now every day

1951.12 --> 1955.76
every every weekday huh

1956.48 --> 1965.279
no no the globe is a religion

1962.32 --> 1968.96
and in your case math on top of that

1965.279 --> 1968.96
math is also your religion

1970.799 --> 1974.6399999999999
not all globers are silly enough or

1973.44 --> 1977.919
deluded enough to

1974.64 --> 1980.3200000000002
actually believe math is reality i used

1977.919 --> 1983.039
to believe it for a while

1980.32 --> 1984.72
but i even know that i even knew that

1983.039 --> 1988.0
math is always an extract

1984.72 --> 1991.679
so literal math is not reality but

1988.0 --> 1994.88
almost everything can potentially be

1991.679 --> 1997.919
described translated into

1994.88 --> 1999.7600000000002
mathematical language right

1997.919 --> 2002.64
but that doesn't make it real that's

1999.76 --> 2002.64
just our

2002.84 --> 2009.9189999999999
consciousness arranging

2005.76 --> 2011.279
a model to match reality it doesn't make

2009.919 --> 2014.5590000000002
it reality it just

2011.279 --> 2017.6
emulates it within

2014.559 --> 2020.559
yeah within our understanding

2017.6 --> 2022.0
but if the physical reality doesn't

2020.559 --> 2025.44
match the model

2022.0 --> 2027.2
or the math and you still believe it

2025.44 --> 2029.519
nonetheless

2027.2 --> 2031.039
well then you got a problem because now

2029.519 --> 2034.96
you're religiously

2031.039 --> 2037.44
believing in math or a model

2034.96 --> 2039.6000000000001
when you have no physical evidence for

2037.44 --> 2039.6000000000001
it

2039.919 --> 2047.8400000000001
ah that's a religion

2050.56 --> 2054.159
yeah the globers definitely don't like

2052.56 --> 2061.359
this

2054.159 --> 2064.639
it's getting very active in jet

2061.359 --> 2067.919
ah i'm making myself look so stupid

2064.639 --> 2071.599
it's so stupid that i just

2067.919 --> 2075.2
explain exactly why the rope the globe

2071.599 --> 2078.3990000000003
is a religion in detail

2075.2 --> 2078.399
over and over again

2081.919 --> 2087.7599999999998
yeah adam akin isn't that just special

2085.52 --> 2089.7599999999998
do i drive a car well i used to i still

2087.76 --> 2093.8390000000004
have my driver's license

2089.76 --> 2096.2400000000002
i'm a great car driver

2093.839 --> 2100.32
i actually considered being a cab driver

2096.24 --> 2100.3199999999997
way back and then i met my ex-girlfriend

2101.599 --> 2104.8
but i've never ever had an accident in a

2104.4 --> 2107.599
car

2104.8 --> 2109.44
ever not even by somebody else except

2107.599 --> 2110.32
one time where they basically just hit

2109.44 --> 2112.7200000000003
the brakes

2110.32 --> 2112.7200000000003
sadly

2114.88 --> 2119.52
and yeah didn't even have any damage

2116.64 --> 2121.44
from that and it was his fault

2119.52 --> 2124.88
it was added traffic light and they just

2121.44 --> 2124.88
hit the brakes when it was green

2127.359 --> 2131.2
that's like the only time that i even

2129.28 --> 2133.3590000000004
got close to having some sort of an

2131.2 --> 2136.16
accident with a car

2133.359 --> 2137.2
nowhere else and i've avoided crashes

2136.16 --> 2138.8799999999997
even

2137.2 --> 2140.3199999999997
where other people were reckless because

2138.88 --> 2145.839
i'm that good of a car driver but i

2140.32 --> 2145.839
don't have a car anymore right now

2151.52 --> 2158.16
what how do you calculate the distance

2156.079 --> 2160.6400000000003
you need to travel

2158.16 --> 2161.44
why would i need to do that you just

2160.64 --> 2165.2799999999997
need to know

2161.44 --> 2168.88
how much a full gas tank goes on average

2165.28 --> 2173.119
under specific conditions

2168.88 --> 2176.2400000000002
and then you just see okay

2173.119 --> 2180.079
how far will i need to go how roughly

2176.24 --> 2180.0789999999997
how much gas do i need for that

2181.04 --> 2185.7599999999998
it's what math you barely need any math

2184.0 --> 2190.079
it's just a

2185.76 --> 2193.3590000000004
a matter of experience of how much gas

2190.079 --> 2195.2000000000003
your car uses and then you see if you

2193.359 --> 2196.0789999999997
think you roughly have enough for that

2195.2 --> 2201.359
and if not you

2196.079 --> 2204.0
fill it up extra that's it what math

2201.359 --> 2204.56
you don't have to model that you just

2204.0 --> 2207.76
have to have

2204.56 --> 2208.24
experience with the device to know how

2207.76 --> 2215.8390000000004
much

2208.24 --> 2215.839
it will roughly take

2216.0 --> 2221.44
no you don't ever need you never need to

2218.64 --> 2223.92
have any numbers for it

2221.44 --> 2225.04
all you need to know how much does a

2223.92 --> 2228.48
full gas tank

2225.04 --> 2232.16
go never need to look at any numbers

2228.48 --> 2234.16
never not even on the on the gas pump

2232.16 --> 2236.24
you don't need you just need to know how

2234.16 --> 2239.04
far will i roughly go

2236.24 --> 2240.4799999999996
with the gas tank and then you don't

2239.04 --> 2242.88
even need to know

2240.48 --> 2244.8
numbers of distance with that you could

2242.88 --> 2247.04
you could measure it up on a map

2244.8 --> 2248.1600000000003
but you just need to go okay in my

2247.04 --> 2250.88
experience how far

2248.16 --> 2251.359
can i drive with a full gas tank to

2250.88 --> 2254.48
which

2251.359 --> 2255.2
city could i go from this point and then

2254.48 --> 2258.48
you just

2255.2 --> 2258.8799999999997
size it up you literally never have to

2258.48 --> 2262.64
have

2258.88 --> 2262.6400000000003
any numbers involved

2263.2 --> 2269.52
in that you just need to know from

2266.4 --> 2273.44
experience you don't need to get any

2269.52 --> 2273.44
math involved this is ridiculous

2274.8 --> 2279.3590000000004
oh my god you go live your life without

2278.32 --> 2282.4
using math

2279.359 --> 2283.2799999999997
ever good luck with that what i didn't

2282.4 --> 2285.76
say that

2283.28 --> 2286.48
i didn't say i never go without math

2285.76 --> 2290.48
although

2286.48 --> 2290.48
i barely use it i don't need it

2291.839 --> 2295.2
my intuition does a job just fine on its

2294.72 --> 2298.56
own

2295.2 --> 2302.0
i don't need math to do

2298.56 --> 2302.64
things but i could i'm not saying that i

2302.0 --> 2305.76
never do

2302.64 --> 2313.839
i just said you don't need

2305.76 --> 2313.8390000000004
math for that specific thing that's it

2313.92 --> 2316.16
see

2321.92 --> 2327.92
size it up really no no no math

2325.44 --> 2328.7200000000003
is about numbers if there's no numbers

2327.92 --> 2331.92
there's no

2328.72 --> 2334.3999999999996
math so if you're not having

2331.92 --> 2337.44
if you're not conceptualizing numbers in

2334.4 --> 2340.48
the process that's not math

2337.44 --> 2342.16
it's more like just using a rope to

2340.48 --> 2344.56
determine length

2342.16 --> 2345.2
when you when you use a rope to

2344.56 --> 2349.119
determine

2345.2 --> 2350.64
length just visually are you using math

2349.119 --> 2352.56
i don't think so there's no numbers

2350.64 --> 2355.5989999999997
involved no you just

2352.56 --> 2358.16
feel it you just look at it size

2355.599 --> 2359.28
the distance up and then compare it to

2358.16 --> 2363.68
something else

2359.28 --> 2366.96
that's not math you're not using numbers

2363.68 --> 2369.2799999999997
do you see not everything is math

2366.96 --> 2373.04
and neither is the scientific method

2369.28 --> 2373.0400000000004
scientific method doesn't use math

2373.44 --> 2381.599
it's not involved it's just a process

2378.16 --> 2384.24
process comparing things

2381.599 --> 2385.2000000000003
in a very specific setup you don't need

2384.24 --> 2387.2799999999997
math

2385.2 --> 2389.2799999999997
you don't need math for a reality

2387.28 --> 2392.32
globers you don't need it

2389.28 --> 2393.119
i know it's it's revolutionary idea like

2392.32 --> 2396.32
how could you

2393.119 --> 2398.6400000000003
not need math for things

2396.32 --> 2399.76
well there's more to reality than just

2398.64 --> 2402.64
math

2399.76 --> 2404.3190000000004
than just modeling everything in a

2402.64 --> 2407.2
virtual way in your mind

2404.319 --> 2408.48
so to convince yourself you have an

2407.2 --> 2409.9199999999996
understanding of it

2408.48 --> 2413.04
even though it's probably not going to

2409.92 --> 2413.599
include other aspects that you haven't

2413.04 --> 2416.079
even

2413.599 --> 2416.88
picked up on yet because that happens a

2416.079 --> 2419.6800000000003
lot

2416.88 --> 2421.52
models are often very incomplete because

2419.68 --> 2422.3999999999996
there's more details that you haven't

2421.52 --> 2424.72
realized

2422.4 --> 2426.4
that are going to be part of it

2424.72 --> 2427.9199999999996
especially with glovers they're very

2426.4 --> 2430.319
short-sighted but they're conditioned

2427.92 --> 2431.64
too because it's very useful to be

2430.319 --> 2433.44
short-sighted in the globe

2431.64 --> 2435.68
conceptualization because there's so

2433.44 --> 2437.52
many proofs against it

2435.68 --> 2439.52
and if you're constantly trying to

2437.52 --> 2442.24
figure out how it works

2439.52 --> 2444.16
you're going to bump into these facts

2442.24 --> 2446.24
that disprove it so

2444.16 --> 2447.839
yeah it's logical that globers in

2446.24 --> 2450.64
general

2447.839 --> 2452.4
are not very inquisitive because there's

2450.64 --> 2455.839
proofs against their globe

2452.4 --> 2455.839
every corner they go

2456.079 --> 2467.8390000000004
see so logical

2468.54 --> 2471.71
[Music]

2472.24 --> 2476.7999999999997
math math math math yeah things use math

2475.68 --> 2480.319
it's very nice

2476.8 --> 2480.7200000000003
it's very very nice but that doesn't

2480.319 --> 2483.7599999999998
make

2480.72 --> 2486.48
math into reality it's just a model it's

2483.76 --> 2486.48
only a model

2486.64 --> 2492.24
a model is not reality reality is not a

2490.8 --> 2495.92
model

2492.24 --> 2499.04
you can try to make a model of reality

2495.92 --> 2502.079
but yeah in that process you can

2499.04 --> 2505.599
overlook a lot of things and then still

2502.079 --> 2508.0
reify that incomplete model into reality

2505.599 --> 2510.4
it's gonna have mistakes though that

2508.0 --> 2513.839
doesn't make it reality

2510.4 --> 2518.319
reality only is revealed

2513.839 --> 2522.0789999999997
when the mistakes are out of the way

2518.319 --> 2524.48
you corrected them then a model becomes

2522.079 --> 2527.8390000000004
closer to reality

2524.48 --> 2529.92
well there's a lot of mistakes errors

2527.839 --> 2533.04
in the globe model that are revealed by

2529.92 --> 2534.96
the housekeeping questions very directly

2533.04 --> 2536.079
and they're not fixed you haven't fixed

2534.96 --> 2540.2400000000002
them you haven't fixed

2536.079 --> 2542.48
any of it so yeah

2540.24 --> 2543.52
that makes your math your model

2542.48 --> 2547.04
incomplete

2543.52 --> 2550.24
incorrect disproven

2547.04 --> 2550.64
you can be assured whatever you're going

2550.24 --> 2553.7599999999998
to do

2550.64 --> 2556.7999999999997
it's not going to turn out to be a globe

2553.76 --> 2565.8390000000004
according to the incorrect model

2556.8 --> 2565.8390000000004
that you assert

2585.44 --> 2593.839
a great arc minute of the great circle

2588.24 --> 2593.839
of the globe

2594.56 --> 2596.88
sure

2598.24 --> 2602.64
or it's basically the span of the

2601.28 --> 2605.0400000000004
equator line

2602.64 --> 2607.1189999999997
that's not necessary the globe that's

2605.04 --> 2608.88
not this that's only the circle of the

2607.119 --> 2611.6800000000003
globe if you presume it

2608.88 --> 2615.28
to be a circle of the globe it could

2611.68 --> 2615.2799999999997
simply be the equator line

2616.24 --> 2623.2
doesn't mean it's a globe it just means

2620.56 --> 2624.16
this system of measurement is based is

2623.2 --> 2629.04
derived

2624.16 --> 2629.04
from the equator length somehow

2629.599 --> 2633.839
and that's interesting it doesn't mean

2632.0 --> 2635.839
it's derived from a globe that part is

2633.839 --> 2638.0
presuppose you just like to insert that

2635.839 --> 2639.92
in there it's so easy to every time you

2638.0 --> 2642.079
just think of the equator line

2639.92 --> 2645.6800000000003
that's the radius because it should be

2642.079 --> 2645.6800000000003
the radius on your globe model

2645.92 --> 2652.88
doesn't mean it is in reality

2650.88 --> 2654.96
the circumference of the globe i know

2652.88 --> 2657.28
you want it to be but you have no proof

2654.96 --> 2657.28
for that

2658.88 --> 2666.0
because there's no curvature

2662.8 --> 2677.8390000000004
and there would have to be

2666.0 --> 2677.839
if the earth was a globe

2687.68 --> 2692.16
nobody cares if you think it's all

2690.319 --> 2694.64
ridiculous nobody cares

2692.16 --> 2696.64
about your ignorance squirting about

2694.64 --> 2699.839
your retraction and your little

2696.64 --> 2702.8799999999997
act of defiance

2699.839 --> 2703.839
in the face of reality and confrontation

2702.88 --> 2707.359
with reality

2703.839 --> 2710.48
nobody cares about your dark

2707.359 --> 2713.68
dark delusional virtue signaling

2710.48 --> 2719.839
nobody cares about that it

2713.68 --> 2719.839
just makes you look stupid

2728.319 --> 2731.599
i'm the one denying mass which mass is

2730.88 --> 2734.2400000000002
that

2731.599 --> 2735.04
the maths that have been disproven the

2734.24 --> 2737.68
model

2735.04 --> 2738.319
that has been disproven in reality that

2737.68 --> 2741.5989999999997
math

2738.319 --> 2744.16
i need deny that mass yeah i deny

2741.599 --> 2746.56
that that math is actually a

2744.16 --> 2748.7999999999997
representation of reality because it's

2746.56 --> 2748.7999999999997
not

2750.319 --> 2754.8
there's all kinds of elements about it

2752.4 --> 2756.1600000000003
that in reality are not there and they

2754.8 --> 2759.52
should be

2756.16 --> 2775.839
if that math model of yours

2759.52 --> 2775.839
was the real thing it's not

2787.28 --> 2792.4
yeah i bet they love you despite being a

2790.319 --> 2795.359
delusional little baltard

2792.4 --> 2797.04
i bet you you know they would have to

2795.359 --> 2799.2
because what's the alternative

2797.04 --> 2801.119
now that it's been established that you

2799.2 --> 2804.96
are a religious baller zealot

2801.119 --> 2808.4
yeah if they're not going to be oh yeah

2804.96 --> 2812.48
aiza lao you're

2808.4 --> 2815.6800000000003
you're so great oh wait are you a girl

2812.48 --> 2818.72
or are you gay i don't know i don't care

2815.68 --> 2822.0789999999997
either way yeah of course they're gonna

2818.72 --> 2824.56
be just dandy with it yeah that's good

2822.079 --> 2826.48
you go girl or whatever you are you

2824.56 --> 2829.599
believe in that globe yeah because

2826.48 --> 2830.0
if they go against it they'll never hear

2829.599 --> 2832.96
the end

2830.0 --> 2833.839
of it you'll just start whining and

2832.96 --> 2836.48
whining

2833.839 --> 2837.52
and pouting about that [ __ ] until you're

2836.48 --> 2840.319
divorced

2837.52 --> 2841.599
and since you have a kid your partner

2840.319 --> 2845.839
probably doesn't

2841.599 --> 2845.839
want that to happen

2846.079 --> 2851.2000000000003
because they got other priorities than

2848.72 --> 2853.4399999999996
your stupid globe religion

2851.2 --> 2855.2
or going against it even they're just

2853.44 --> 2856.16
probably more interested in keeping the

2855.2 --> 2858.7999999999997
family together

2856.16 --> 2861.7599999999998
even though you are a religious zealot

2858.8 --> 2866.559
with your stupid little reifying math

2861.76 --> 2866.559
that doesn't exist in reality yeah of

2870.839 --> 2873.839
course

2875.76 --> 2883.119
i zalo is it low

2879.68 --> 2883.1189999999997
is it lao or lu

2884.839 --> 2890.319
okay

2886.16 --> 2890.319
sorry i'm not used to names like that

2892.8 --> 2906.88
all right

2900.96 --> 2906.88
mr jones is female no this is a lou

2908.319 --> 2915.839
may be female i don't know

2911.52 --> 2915.839
talking about husband

2918.16 --> 2922.3999999999996
all right okay well maybe you're part of

2921.119 --> 2924.6400000000003
a

2922.4 --> 2927.839
a heavily globe indoctrinated little

2924.64 --> 2931.7599999999998
family do you have globes everywhere

2927.839 --> 2934.5589999999997
are you promising your kid regularly

2931.76 --> 2937.0400000000004
that in a just a few in a decade or so

2934.559 --> 2938.4
yeah we will go tomorrow so if you work

2937.04 --> 2940.48
hard in school

2938.4 --> 2942.079
then maybe you have a chance of going

2940.48 --> 2945.119
are you one of those families because

2942.079 --> 2949.04
then i just straight out pity you

2945.119 --> 2953.359
and oh yeah another thing once your kid

2949.04 --> 2956.4
finds out that it's all a lie

2953.359 --> 2959.44
they're going to hate you

2956.4 --> 2963.599
really bad they're going to really think

2959.44 --> 2965.28
you're [ __ ] pathetic which you are

2963.599 --> 2966.8
and they will probably turn a flat

2965.28 --> 2970.079
earther

2966.8 --> 2971.2000000000003
especially now it's very it's it's the

2970.079 --> 2974.48
thing to do now

2971.2 --> 2976.319
you know you want to go rebellion

2974.48 --> 2977.76
you want a real rebellion not some

2976.319 --> 2981.68
stupid sjw

2977.76 --> 2985.28
[ __ ] beast [ __ ] disgusting stuff

2981.68 --> 2988.64
well just rebel against your [ __ ]

2985.28 --> 2990.88
globe believing parents tell them

2988.64 --> 2992.0789999999997
why don't you prove the housekeeping

2990.88 --> 2994.8
questions

2992.079 --> 2996.7200000000003
and then see as they your parents

2994.8 --> 3000.1600000000003
suddenly start responding

2996.72 --> 3003.2
to you like eight-year-olds

3000.16 --> 3006.8799999999997
like absolute morons just

3003.2 --> 3007.2
reveal themselves to be not just parents

3006.88 --> 3009.6800000000003
but

3007.2 --> 3010.8799999999997
also religious fanatic retards and then

3009.68 --> 3013.5989999999997
you'll know

3010.88 --> 3014.48
yeah i won't be a part of that i don't

3013.599 --> 3017.44
want to look

3014.48 --> 3018.319
like a complete [ __ ] that constantly

3017.44 --> 3021.119
reaffires

3018.319 --> 3023.2799999999997
the disproved things i don't want to be

3021.119 --> 3024.8
part of that

3023.28 --> 3026.7200000000003
it's it's a great and hey there's a

3024.8 --> 3029.3590000000004
whole community out here

3026.72 --> 3030.48
people that agree with you and that'll

3029.359 --> 3032.96
talk with you

3030.48 --> 3034.88
you can explain your troubles about your

3032.96 --> 3038.48
parents

3034.88 --> 3039.28
how they constantly reify disproven math

3038.48 --> 3041.76
models

3039.28 --> 3044.559
into reality and how they'll never stop

3041.76 --> 3049.28
whining about it

3044.559 --> 3049.28
yeah there's room for you here

3052.839 --> 3055.839
so

3055.89 --> 3058.949
[Music]

3060.4 --> 3065.359
no they're not my housekeeping questions

3063.599 --> 3066.559
and they're not of a high priest now

3065.359 --> 3070.16
they're universal

3066.559 --> 3072.2400000000002
they are questions

3070.16 --> 3073.44
for everyone they're everyone's

3072.24 --> 3075.52
questions everyone

3073.44 --> 3077.76
has a like a sense everyone that has an

3075.52 --> 3079.119
inquisitive minds everyone that wants to

3077.76 --> 3081.92
know the truth

3079.119 --> 3083.04
everyone that is willing to lay down

3081.92 --> 3086.64
their dreams

3083.04 --> 3086.64
to figure out what is real

3087.92 --> 3096.48
that's whose questions those are

3091.839 --> 3099.92
they're everyone's

3096.48 --> 3100.319
yeah okay you go spiraling about your

3099.92 --> 3103.6800000000003
math

3100.319 --> 3107.2799999999997
reification that's fine share your pain

3103.68 --> 3109.44
mr jones uh thank you by the way for the

3107.28 --> 3112.4
99 cent super chat donation good servant

3109.44 --> 3112.4
much appreciated

3116.559 --> 3123.599
see see how this reification works what

3120.4 --> 3126.319
well if math is not reality

3123.599 --> 3128.0
then nothing is reality see that's what

3126.319 --> 3130.0
a religion does

3128.0 --> 3132.319
if you take away the foundations of the

3130.0 --> 3135.44
belief in the face of reality

3132.319 --> 3137.119
then nothing can be real you know this

3135.44 --> 3138.16
is a typical response for a lot of

3137.119 --> 3140.559
people

3138.16 --> 3143.2
this is also why for example the idea

3140.559 --> 3145.52
everything is a holographic matrix

3143.2 --> 3147.52
reality is not physically real but it's

3145.52 --> 3150.88
like a matrix projection

3147.52 --> 3153.28
that is a typical thing for people to do

3150.88 --> 3155.119
because if everything you trust on

3153.28 --> 3156.559
always everything that you thought was

3155.119 --> 3159.28
real

3156.559 --> 3161.8390000000004
and that you reified turns out not to be

3159.28 --> 3163.76
real and if that shines through

3161.839 --> 3166.0789999999997
then you kind of panic and then you

3163.76 --> 3168.559
think nothing is real

3166.079 --> 3170.559
that's what happens when you let go of a

3168.559 --> 3171.8390000000004
religious assertion for a second it's

3170.559 --> 3174.3190000000004
quite depressing

3171.839 --> 3176.0789999999997
and that's why most people then after a

3174.319 --> 3178.72
short while

3176.079 --> 3180.319
start to forget about that and then go

3178.72 --> 3182.0
straight back to the religious

3180.319 --> 3184.88
assertions

3182.0 --> 3186.48
that's what people do if it's too

3184.88 --> 3188.8
depressing

3186.48 --> 3189.68
when their religion is broken they'll

3188.8 --> 3193.76
get yeah

3189.68 --> 3196.96
they'll just wander off

3193.76 --> 3198.8
forget about it and then one day wake up

3196.96 --> 3201.2
like nothing happened and get bit right

3198.8 --> 3204.7200000000003
back oh yeah the globe oh

3201.2 --> 3209.839
yeah that's how it works it's a spell

3204.72 --> 3209.839
people it's a spell

3211.599 --> 3219.52
it's a ponzi scheme of belief

3215.52 --> 3219.52
and it plays tricks on your memory

3219.92 --> 3223.52
if you're gonna double down on that

3221.599 --> 3227.44
belief that's how it works

3223.52 --> 3237.839
isn't that just amazing and crazy

3227.44 --> 3237.839
but it's real that's how it works

3239.68 --> 3244.0
how tall am i well

3244.079 --> 3247.119
i'm this tall

3247.359 --> 3265.839
right oh i didn't use

3250.48 --> 3265.839
math hmm

3274.64 --> 3279.5899999999997
okay the camera didn't pick up that

3276.24 --> 3282.6189999999997
entirely but

3279.59 --> 3282.619
[Music]

3290.839 --> 3293.839
right

3301.04 --> 3307.839
one one r wins length yeah

3317.599 --> 3324.799
right but anyway you know measuring

3321.2 --> 3328.64
lengths the the numerics behind it

3324.799 --> 3332.4
that's a convention it's

3328.64 --> 3336.72
only there because

3332.4 --> 3339.28
it people want to use it to compare

3336.72 --> 3341.359
the lengths a length on its own doesn't

3339.28 --> 3343.76
mean anything it only

3341.359 --> 3347.2799999999997
becomes relevant to people because they

3343.76 --> 3350.0
can compare it to something else

3347.28 --> 3350.7200000000003
technically there is no math required

3350.0 --> 3354.16
you could

3350.72 --> 3354.5589999999997
apply math to figure out like how things

3354.16 --> 3357.04
fit

3354.559 --> 3357.0400000000004
and all that

3357.599 --> 3361.6800000000003
sure you could apply it but it's not the

3359.92 --> 3364.88
baseline

3361.68 --> 3367.359
necessity it's just a convention you

3364.88 --> 3367.359
compare

3374.839 --> 3380.4
lengths

3376.88 --> 3380.4
yeah okay you can

3381.119 --> 3384.96
it's enough already with the straight

3383.76 --> 3387.3590000000004
out at homes

3384.96 --> 3388.799
just if you have some arguments that

3387.359 --> 3390.72
would be nice

3388.799 --> 3392.48
you can even scored a little about how

3390.72 --> 3393.68
much you believe your own [ __ ] but if

3392.48 --> 3398.0
you're just

3393.68 --> 3399.7599999999998
gonna do nothing but a few at homes

3398.0 --> 3402.079
that aren't even grounded in anything

3399.76 --> 3402.7200000000003
that i said so far then yeah you're just

3402.079 --> 3404.4
gonna

3402.72 --> 3408.0
be timed out and if you're gonna

3404.4 --> 3408.0
continue that you're gonna get banned

3412.24 --> 3416.72
how do you know the size of an object

3414.0 --> 3419.839
you're comparing it to

3416.72 --> 3419.839
by comparing it

3426.96 --> 3429.2
oh

3430.559 --> 3433.8390000000004
one of those

3448.559 --> 3453.119
get the [ __ ] out dude yeah and i'm not

3451.76 --> 3456.1600000000003
gonna unban you again

3453.119 --> 3460.319
okay [ __ ] so don't so don't even try

3456.16 --> 3460.319
asking somewhere else and whining about

3460.559 --> 3465.8390000000004
no if this is what you're gonna do in my

3462.799 --> 3475.839
chat i'm not gonna unban you again

3465.839 --> 3475.839
just get the [ __ ] out

3481.67 --> 3486.319
[Music]

3484.24 --> 3488.0
right but i'm gonna round out the show

3486.319 --> 3490.079
the the trolls are all

3488.0 --> 3491.68
squirting out of control anyway and they

3490.079 --> 3493.2000000000003
should because the flat earth debate is

3491.68 --> 3496.72
about to start

3493.2 --> 3498.319
the main course where the ballers really

3496.72 --> 3500.8799999999997
get grinded into a pulp

3498.319 --> 3503.839
although i think i i mashed it up pretty

3500.88 --> 3503.839
good i think i

3504.0 --> 3511.52
did like use the dough roller to turn

3507.92 --> 3514.319
to make some pancakes out of globes here

3511.52 --> 3516.24
and yeah they always try to inflate

3514.319 --> 3519.2799999999997
themselves back into a globe but

3516.24 --> 3521.04
yeah that's that's

3519.28 --> 3523.44
going to be a little bit difficult when

3521.04 --> 3525.2799999999997
our winds around with the dough roller

3523.44 --> 3526.48
so anyway i'm going to round out the
