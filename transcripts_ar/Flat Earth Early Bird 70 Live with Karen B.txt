3.35 --> 10.83
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

7.319 --> 17.42
early-bird number 70 I'm your host

10.83 --> 17.42
Arwen and today it's been quite a day

19.25 --> 25.21
sorry for being so late

22.04 --> 25.21
[Applause]

29.62 --> 32.76
hectic hectic hectic

35.469 --> 38.1
it's like

40.879 --> 48.32
making my focus kind of jumbled yeah so

46.489 --> 55.01
much has have been happening now it's

48.32 --> 57.649
just uh let's say had a lot of things I

55.01 --> 60.649
had to take care of financially today

57.649 --> 64.399
and that actually turned out to be

60.649 --> 71.02
really good so I'm relieved of that but

64.399 --> 74.5
despite that simultaneously you say yes

71.02 --> 78.59
so they dipped into a philosophical

74.5 --> 82.61
crisis since yesterday night way too

78.59 --> 88.0
late that the most inconvenient time

82.61 --> 91.85
possible yeah I was watching

88.0 --> 92.36
Patricia's hang out with this guy his

91.85 --> 95.78
name again

92.36 --> 98.44
I forgot Daniel oh yeah volume sorry

95.78 --> 98.44
forgot that

100.259 --> 103.07
it's this better

103.729 --> 111.82
right

106.4 --> 116.89
so yeah they were starting to talk about

111.82 --> 120.88999999999999
the Mandela effect and very very long

116.89 --> 123.86
the I had my own approach to it but as I

120.89 --> 130.34
was basically listening and hearing the

123.86 --> 133.64
guy out I eventually was hurt by the

130.34 --> 139.7
realization that it wasn't just this

133.64 --> 141.73999999999998
simple and yeah from that sprang what

139.7 --> 145.33999999999997
some could consider an existential

141.74 --> 148.04000000000002
philosophical crisis and I explained it

145.34 --> 151.76
in chat in the flat earth really bear

148.04 --> 155.09
chat so anyone can can read what that

151.76 --> 161.38
was all about that is part of the Flat

155.09 --> 161.38
Earth really bear chat but oh my god

163.319 --> 171.569
now that effect apparently it reaches

167.43 --> 178.92000000000002
far beyond just my new changes as I had

171.569 --> 182.60899999999998
imagined and I'm just wondering what can

178.92 --> 185.67
this be what is this and what is this in

182.609 --> 188.37
the grander scheme of things and things

185.67 --> 192.92999999999998
become quite derailed when you start to

188.37 --> 196.47
think about that dangerous like I feel

192.93 --> 199.079
our Imam all over it all over it and

196.47 --> 202.769
that's just dangerous and I actually

199.079 --> 207.15
didn't even get well pissed off in chat

202.769 --> 210.23000000000002
at Patricius which is weird

207.15 --> 214.25
I guess must have been weird to people

210.23 --> 217.73899999999998
me started starting to talk in caps and

214.25 --> 220.019
I left and I should have probably left a

217.739 --> 223.409
lot quicker because it was just getting

220.019 --> 228.989
very unhealthy for me and there was no

223.409 --> 231.17999999999998
response there was and I don't know why

228.989 --> 235.709
I don't know why but there was no

231.18 --> 237.769
response they just kept on rolling and

235.709 --> 237.769
rolling

237.81 --> 247.11
and there was no response while I urged

242.43 --> 249.22
like what do we do with this information

247.11 --> 252.959
there's no response

249.22 --> 259.799
what do we do with this if this is real

252.959 --> 265.62
don't you see the unfathomable

259.799 --> 268.62
unfathomable danger that it can present

265.62 --> 268.62
okay

271.1 --> 278.05
and yeah saya saya by who saya by

276.47 --> 285.64000000000004
everyone

278.05 --> 289.87
what is a saya you see it could be a

285.64 --> 292.90999999999997
massive saya of which we are all apart

289.87 --> 298.73
in the sense and I reason this out yeah

292.91 --> 301.82000000000005
maybe they found a way to use resonance

298.73 --> 305.08000000000004
technology on the highest level to

301.82 --> 314.9
collectively change all of our memories

305.08 --> 319.15999999999997
but that is bizarre and dangerous beyond

314.9 --> 322.65999999999997
imagining because that means that if you

319.16 --> 325.55
control minds so directly not through

322.66 --> 328.27000000000004
manipulation from the outside but from

325.55 --> 332.0
the inside then what are we left with

328.27 --> 337.31
what can we really do that matters they

332.0 --> 339.58
can just click and suddenly it's all

337.31 --> 339.58
different

340.15 --> 347.919
people could be gone that have always

342.16 --> 351.82000000000005
existed or certainly the paths choices

347.919 --> 355.35999999999996
people made dedications life works could

351.82 --> 357.07
some the no longer be there and the

355.36 --> 361.78000000000003
person is now doing something completely

357.07 --> 364.3
different and that feels nothing for for

361.78 --> 370.13899999999995
their original dedication that type of

364.3 --> 372.55
thing do you see do you see how absurdly

370.139 --> 378.25
threatening this is especially to

372.55 --> 380.65000000000003
someone like me on the other hand the

378.25 --> 383.77
exact opposite would be the same the

380.65 --> 388.92999999999995
exact opposite and now it gets really

383.77 --> 391.15
weird and ethereal one of this world is

388.93 --> 394.09000000000003
much more similar Tory than I thought

391.15 --> 398.979
and it can indeed be physically changed

394.09 --> 402.09
but with a strange side effect that

398.979 --> 405.07
though anything physical can be changed

402.09 --> 408.539
maybe the conscious and the spirit

405.07 --> 408.539
cannot be changed

412.82 --> 420.17
and what is the consequences of that and

415.7 --> 424.01
where will it lead to yeah and now you

420.17 --> 426.92
get into really weird stuff like for

424.01 --> 430.21999999999997
example I laid a connection with what

426.92 --> 433.33000000000004
happened to the Tarte Aryans just

430.22 --> 436.01000000000005
imagine they've found a peak

433.33 --> 439.37
civilization with a perfect but almost

436.01 --> 442.46
perfect balance and responsibility and

439.37 --> 446.03000000000003
honor and control and shepherding the

442.46 --> 448.34
other less lesser peoples well what if

446.03 --> 449.96
the dark ones whatever they were

448.34 --> 452.23999999999995
whatever they are

449.96 --> 454.78999999999996
maybe it's the shadow side of the tart

452.24 --> 457.7
Aryans themselves the dark ones among

454.79 --> 462.11
them I don't know what if they started

457.7 --> 464.93
doing this changing reality step by step

462.11 --> 466.40000000000003
and the tart Aryans just saw that it was

464.93 --> 469.49
changing right in front of them

466.4 --> 473.27
basically and what if this went so far

469.49 --> 477.17
so incredibly far that they just became

473.27 --> 479.59
completely derailed from the current

477.17 --> 482.03000000000003
their current reality as it became

479.59 --> 487.07
wouldn't they be driven to absolute

482.03 --> 489.77
madness you know and when you become mad

487.07 --> 492.83
enough for something like that would you

489.77 --> 495.68
not just start killing and cannibalizing

492.83 --> 497.57
everything just completely letting go of

495.68 --> 500.23
the spirit that just hurts because

497.57 --> 504.43
nothing is as it should be

500.23 --> 504.43
yeah so

504.84 --> 508.78999999999996
think about that for a moment

512.24 --> 519.059
is that what this is is that

515.8 --> 519.059
what they're starting

523.06 --> 527.8299999999999
and what are we gonna do what are we

525.73 --> 532.35
gonna do if this aggravates if things

527.83 --> 537.46
change so dramatically and not just

532.35 --> 539.8000000000001
maybe not just in one yeah a change or a

537.46 --> 541.69
moment but just gradually and things

539.8 --> 543.3389999999999
just keep on changing and we all

541.69 --> 546.6700000000001
remember it differently and more

543.339 --> 551.08
differently and even more how is this

546.67 --> 553.12
gonna affect our minds okay I guess

551.08 --> 555.01
that'd be the loonies out there that

553.12 --> 557.77
have completely given up and surrender

555.01 --> 559.779
to the void they won't even notice

557.77 --> 561.6999999999999
because it's all the same to them but

559.779 --> 565.98
for us for the ones that are actually

561.7 --> 569.1400000000001
caring what is that gonna do to us and

565.98 --> 571.66
how do we defend ourselves against this

569.14 --> 574.4499999999999
well I've actually figured something out

571.66 --> 575.26
through all this craziness I figured

574.45 --> 581.4100000000001
something out

575.26 --> 583.27
there is the path because if physical

581.41 --> 585.49
reality if the our memories can be

583.27 --> 588.22
changed like this collectively there is

585.49 --> 591.58
literally nothing we can do about it but

588.22 --> 593.589
just forget it and try to move on but if

591.58 --> 596.26
reality is changing and our spirits

593.589 --> 598.6600000000001
remain the same then there is an

596.26 --> 601.75
existential conclusion you can draw for

598.66 --> 604.63
it from this because that means that

601.75 --> 606.82
everything that actually happened but

604.63 --> 610.18
was altered not to happen in the

606.82 --> 613.1800000000001
spiritual realm still exists so

610.18 --> 615.64
everything that has ever existed will

613.18 --> 619.4499999999999
exist even though it has never happened

615.64 --> 622.18
yeah think about that and that drawn

619.45 --> 626.19
from that conclusion we could consider

622.18 --> 629.0799999999999
that Christ Jesus Christ and what he did

626.19 --> 631.24
even though they may have yeah think

629.08 --> 631.99
about it physically erase that from

631.24 --> 634.0600000000001
everything

631.99 --> 637.36
happen from him ever coming into being

634.06 --> 641.709
in the spiritual realm that will still

637.36 --> 646.029
be there so what can we do we can follow

641.709 --> 649.1199999999999
the spiritual path and the principles

646.029 --> 651.1899999999999
and keep them in us not in some writing

649.12 --> 654.0600000000001
not reflect on some writing out there

651.19 --> 658.87
that just changes before our very eyes

654.06 --> 660.55
but only in us only in ourselves can we

658.87 --> 668.339
maintain the knowledge as the world

660.55 --> 673.9499999999999
turns literally to chaos around us yes

668.339 --> 678.899
makes sense in that way and it gives

673.95 --> 683.86
consolidation how do you say consoles me

678.899 --> 688.149
calms me because no matter what physical

683.86 --> 690.57
reality may turn out to become retro

688.149 --> 690.57
actively

691.089 --> 698.229
in the end the spiritual part of it that

693.909 --> 700.899
will still still be right it will still

698.229 --> 702.9390000000001
be basically as we imagined maybe even

700.899 --> 704.859
different because we were born into a

702.939 --> 706.659
situation where already so much has

704.859 --> 708.399
changed and the story had changed and

706.659 --> 710.529
the original story is not really what it

708.399 --> 712.659
was but that thing that happened that

710.529 --> 716.289
energetic spiritual thing that happened

712.659 --> 719.199
and the essence of that spirit had

716.289 --> 724.929
existed even though it doesn't

719.199 --> 726.939
physically exist anymore in the past but

724.929 --> 729.009
it has existed it is there it is

726.939 --> 732.069
something and we can latch onto that

729.009 --> 734.8290000000001
onto that spirit onto that direction

732.069 --> 739.199
onto that path no matter what reality

734.829 --> 742.2389999999999
tells us because yeah

739.199 --> 745.389
if they can change things that they can

742.239 --> 748.089
change the Bible as part of the theory

745.389 --> 751.059
then they could literally if they were

748.089 --> 754.2990000000001
sadistic enough turn the Bible into a

751.059 --> 757.509
literal Lucifer worshipping book and

754.299 --> 761.699
just replace Jesus with Lucifer what do

757.509 --> 761.6990000000001
we do that yeah

762.07 --> 767.8900000000001
you know what we have to do we have to

764.14 --> 770.64
stick to what our spirit knows and

767.89 --> 773.59
ignore the world that has turned

770.64 --> 777.15
absolutely 180 degrees into madness

773.59 --> 777.15
that's what I think about that

780.54 --> 787.56
so complex I know your ear many of you

784.77 --> 791.28
are probably gonna have to pause this

787.56 --> 794.9599999999999
and just rewatch it again maybe again to

791.28 --> 794.9599999999999
figure out what I'm talking about here

799.6 --> 803.1
right wit wit well

803.8 --> 808.27
maybe half of him has already been

806.589 --> 811.149
removed

808.27 --> 815.17
maybe the entire story will completely

811.149 --> 818.47
change totally changed far beyond

815.17 --> 821.74
recognition it will not be it might

818.47 --> 826.839
become a a book that we simply do not

821.74 --> 831.36
know even as we wipe the dust of our

826.839 --> 831.36
grandpa's old Bible you know

831.51 --> 837.36
that's madness that is that is maddening

834.48 --> 840.75
for anyone who sticks who clings to the

837.36 --> 844.41
physical for a reflection for

840.75 --> 847.44
confirmation well the conclusion is the

844.41 --> 849.899
only true confirmation we can find in

847.44 --> 853.889
the spirit in our spirit and potentially

849.899 --> 857.339
in the recognition of other spirits that

853.889 --> 860.13
are also in the same frequency and that

857.339 --> 863.339
counts for our manifestation here in

860.13 --> 866.399
this world in the linear time line in in

863.339 --> 869.5790000000001
being thrilling this this temple of

866.399 --> 874.38
flesh and it will count on the other

869.579 --> 876.899
side once we are dead even though they

874.38 --> 880.98
may erase all traces of our physical

876.899 --> 884.67
being as we left as we leave it doesn't

880.98 --> 886.62
matter if they have this control then

884.67 --> 889.829
there is nothing we can do about it but

886.62 --> 893.97
do things about what we can do and that

889.829 --> 895.9799999999999
is just follow that path and try to work

893.97 --> 900.11
through this because it would be a

895.98 --> 900.11
cosmic battle basic

900.3 --> 909.9599999999999
on and within reality itself but it's

905.64 --> 914.03
not one that is automatically one by one

909.96 --> 916.71
side it is a continuing surreal

914.03 --> 919.31
interdimensional battle of spiritual

916.71 --> 919.3100000000001
essences

929.23 --> 936.13
so we will see you will see how far this

932.47 --> 939.97
goes and maybe it wants maybe this was

936.13 --> 942.49
just an experiment on a smaller scale to

939.97 --> 943.51
see what we would do how it would

942.49 --> 946.12
respond to this

943.51 --> 949.87
maybe that is its function we don't know

946.12 --> 954.07
we well we will find out if more changes

949.87 --> 957.1
dramatically you know maybe they're

954.07 --> 960.61
gonna pull this insane joke on us and

957.1 --> 964.51
literally make Australia disappear think

960.61 --> 968.16
about that yeah that would be the joke

964.51 --> 971.5
right ha ha ha how funny

968.16 --> 974.86
Thanks now let's hope that doesn't

971.5 --> 978.46
happen I've gotten to know a few

974.86 --> 980.65
Australians that I kind of like and a

978.46 --> 984.9100000000001
lot there they're really annoying but

980.65 --> 987.18
yeah I don't see a purpose to remove

984.91 --> 987.18
that

988.47 --> 996.35
really I don't really see a purpose to

991.02 --> 1001.72
change the layout of how things are I

996.35 --> 1001.72
just want it to be worked out as it is

1002.11 --> 1008.72
really and all these changes the only

1006.56 --> 1011.2399999999999
thing they do is create more chaos in

1008.72 --> 1012.53
the spirits and I don't think that's

1011.24 --> 1018.95
good for anything I think it's

1012.53 --> 1021.5
unbalanced so whoever is doing this if

1018.95 --> 1029.41
they are doing this if it is what I

1021.5 --> 1029.41
think it is stop doing it please

1034.12 --> 1040.7099999999998
this serves no logical purpose if you

1041.27 --> 1049.039
derailed the building path the learning

1044.209 --> 1050.99
curve of every one as they go then what

1049.039 --> 1054.3799999999999
is the meaning of it all you take away

1050.99 --> 1056.75
the meaning of it all so if it is

1054.38 --> 1061.39
actually an individual that is doing

1056.75 --> 1061.39
this serves no purpose

1067.61 --> 1073.04
yeah anyway I completely understand for

1071.24 --> 1076.7
anyone out there that just outright

1073.04 --> 1078.86
refuses to even consider the mandala

1076.7 --> 1081.5900000000001
effect to be physically real in any

1078.86 --> 1086.81
manner and as I said I started out

1081.59 --> 1092.08
thinking yeah it's probably all trick

1086.81 --> 1092.08
but there's some tricks that are so big

1092.32 --> 1098.33
it would be a magician's trick an

1096.07 --> 1101.6599999999999
interdimensional throughout time

1098.33 --> 1104.4499999999998
magician's trick of just unimaginable

1101.66 --> 1107.8600000000001
proportions it would be so such an

1104.45 --> 1111.32
elaborate magician's trick that's just

1107.86 --> 1114.3799999999999
well if it was I would have to recognize

1111.32 --> 1116.9299999999998
that I am NOT and never will be smart

1114.38 --> 1119.2700000000002
enough to completely understand what the

1116.93 --> 1122.24
hell really happened for that to

1119.27 --> 1124.79
manifest in such a way that there was no

1122.24 --> 1127.25
mind alterations happening from the

1124.79 --> 1132.74
inside and no physical changes done in

1127.25 --> 1136.84
the world how how could they met like

1132.74 --> 1139.79
with a few things okay you know like

1136.84 --> 1143.6799999999998
what I talked about even in chat earlier

1139.79 --> 1148.79
around during Patricia's hangout yeah

1143.68 --> 1151.03
something could have a certain name like

1148.79 --> 1155.77
a movie

1151.03 --> 1157.48
and that name would be off a word would

1155.77 --> 1160.03
be off it would feel like it would make

1157.48 --> 1163.33
no sense and we would automatically to

1160.03 --> 1164.86
say like no it should be this what a

1163.33 --> 1167.71
thing could be that that is a

1164.86 --> 1170.4399999999998
psychological fact that exists and that

1167.71 --> 1172.69
will turn out eventually as everyone

1170.44 --> 1175.29
actually remembering the thing how it

1172.69 --> 1182.02
should be and not how it actually is and

1175.29 --> 1184.36
if you only like interrupts the gradual

1182.02 --> 1186.55
sinking in of all that information if

1184.36 --> 1189.6399999999999
you're interrupted somewhere then that

1186.55 --> 1192.73
may be experienced as like hey this is

1189.64 --> 1196.7800000000002
new but it's actually not new because

1192.73 --> 1201.1
you just forgot how it came to be so

1196.78 --> 1204.1299999999999
that could be a core part of that trick

1201.1 --> 1208.4499999999998
but it's so more such it's so elaborate

1204.13 --> 1212.47
it's so big like land layout changes and

1208.45 --> 1214.8600000000001
all these things and I don't understand

1212.47 --> 1221.47
how such a thing could be tricked I

1214.86 --> 1226.9199999999998
can't understand it but yeah it might be

1221.47 --> 1230.38
my god what a trick what an insanely big

1226.92 --> 1234.6100000000001
complex magician's trick would that be

1230.38 --> 1237.92
if that was how it is but I still

1234.61 --> 1244.78
consider the other things also that I

1237.92 --> 1244.78
as a very troublesome possibility

1250.35 --> 1254.9399999999998
so yeah let's see

1260.75 --> 1266.75
yep I've been steadily but slowly losing

1264.47 --> 1267.32
a couple of subscribers again doesn't

1266.75 --> 1270.289
matter really

1267.32 --> 1272.23
although yeah please do check if you are

1270.289 --> 1276.7
subscribed to my channel and if you

1272.23 --> 1279.59
think you are then check again this is

1276.7 --> 1283.52
probably not some mandala effect this is

1279.59 --> 1285.83
probably algorithm related but ya do

1283.52 --> 1288.4
check and subscribe to my channel

1285.83 --> 1290.84
because yeah I did make the thousand but

1288.4 --> 1293.48
this is this should not be the end

1290.84 --> 1296.09
there's more it's more to talk about

1293.48 --> 1299.32
there's these subjects also to talk

1296.09 --> 1303.289
about and philosophize about steadily

1299.32 --> 1305.71
steadily climbing in energy I can I can

1303.289 --> 1308.84
jump all the way up it would break me

1305.71 --> 1311.929
but even this subject just uh nerves we

1308.84 --> 1314.36
don't have to be very careful with

1311.929 --> 1317.24
expressing myself in this or I would

1314.36 --> 1319.58
become vulnerable to I Romanian

1317.24 --> 1322.85
influences as I describe felt that

1319.58 --> 1326.72
presence I felt that energy as this

1322.85 --> 1328.82
realization hit me so but I'm defending

1326.72 --> 1332.059
against it and I already figured out the

1328.82 --> 1336.26
path again the solution is the path no

1332.059 --> 1339.74
matter what it's incredible and I've

1336.26 --> 1342.65
gave you a very solid I felt very

1339.74 --> 1346.269
structured explanation as to why why it

1342.65 --> 1352.299
really would be if if this thing is

1346.269 --> 1352.299
fear it could be but right

1360.14 --> 1362.74
and

1366.249 --> 1376.519
all right well you know cash selling out

1372.559 --> 1379.119
well yeah you know you can act out the

1376.519 --> 1381.739
line for a moment to grab attention

1379.119 --> 1384.9089999999999
there's some people that might like that

1381.739 --> 1389.44
form of doing that is that really

1384.909 --> 1392.2990000000002
corrupting you know there's there is a

1389.44 --> 1396.71
different layers of how far you can go

1392.299 --> 1401.899
and truly the people that are a hundred

1396.71 --> 1404.45
percent persistently stable I get kind

1401.899 --> 1406.399
of boring it's like the Vulcan you know

1404.45 --> 1408.589
yeah they are perfectly in control

1406.399 --> 1413.4189999999999
that's their culture they must and they

1408.589 --> 1415.729
want to but yeah it's still very very

1413.419 --> 1417.169
interesting that they suppress this

1415.729 --> 1419.8690000000001
Ridge and every time it comes around

1417.169 --> 1421.789
yeah I find that very interesting like

1419.869 --> 1423.259
in the Star Trek series that's the more

1421.789 --> 1426.769
fascinating part about it it's actually

1423.259 --> 1427.549
when the control is lost so how does it

1426.769 --> 1430.58
really work

1427.549 --> 1435.57
can you stay perfectly on the path

1430.58 --> 1438.85
always I don't think so and even

1435.57 --> 1442.45
the scholars of the Bible in the path of

1438.85 --> 1446.5
Christ confirm this it's almost

1442.45 --> 1449.5
impossible for a human to do that but

1446.5 --> 1454.27
you can strive to do it and be very

1449.5 --> 1456.25
careful so yeah I will absolutely try to

1454.27 --> 1459.49
stay as stable as I can but I will have

1456.25 --> 1463.12
my crazy moments and that's just in me

1459.49 --> 1465.28
and I might also make mistakes and then

1463.12 --> 1470.1689999999999
as soon as I figure that out I will try

1465.28 --> 1474.7
to correct them so and that's basically

1470.169 --> 1479.25
all we can really hope to do if we want

1474.7 --> 1479.25
to do things right so

1479.9 --> 1485.0
oh yeah by the way also share of this

1481.88 --> 1490.5200000000002
show on any social media see you've been

1485.0 --> 1495.74

wow it's a crowded place oh yeah I'll do

the show I hope you appreciate ensuring

1543.13 --> 1550.0700000000002
it's kind of good to put it out there

1546.289 --> 1553.73
you know I have this weird thing that

1550.07 --> 1557.87
I'm also noticing about myself this is

1553.73 --> 1561.919
again bit personal and that is that due

1557.87 --> 1564.83
to my very sensitive nature when things

1561.919 --> 1570.19
impact me thanks to my insights that are

1564.83 --> 1573.73
very quick to see things I often

1570.19 --> 1578.68
fear I'm kind of overprotective for the

1573.73 --> 1581.82
world sometimes that I fear that I can

1578.68 --> 1581.8200000000002
go too far and

1583.82 --> 1590.629
I'm the yeah but I'm forgetting that as

1587.169 --> 1593.0900000000001
I'm going through all of this and the

1590.629 --> 1599.57
information revolution other people are

1593.09 --> 1602.4789999999998
also growing so perhaps I should find to

1599.57 --> 1605.96
my view on other people a little bit

1602.479 --> 1608.8690000000001
more and approach them more a little bit

1605.96 --> 1610.989
more like don't take it personal what

1608.869 --> 1613.9399999999998
like teenagers instead of preteens

1610.989 --> 1616.249
because they kind of need a challenge so

1613.94 --> 1620.299
I need to maybe push it a little bit

1616.249 --> 1622.009
further and really get well more and

1620.299 --> 1623.599
more into the ethereal more and more

1622.009 --> 1625.869
into the dark world and I just have to

1623.599 --> 1629.1789999999999
be very careful in the process

1625.869 --> 1635.2099999999998
concerning myself because as I climbed

1629.179 --> 1638.71
out of all that I was scared out of my

1635.21 --> 1643.099
mind and I was deluded I was manipulated

1638.71 --> 1648.169
throughout very harshly and so I have

1643.099 --> 1651.859
some memories of things that physically

1648.169 --> 1655.22
never happened that haunt me and I need

1651.859 --> 1658.01
to be very careful basically we're

1655.22 --> 1659.96
dealing this the dark world

1658.01 --> 1665.09
my vision experiences and with these

1659.96 --> 1670.15
entities and the faces they carried and

1665.09 --> 1672.53
all that but at the same time

1670.15 --> 1675.68
philosophically speaking there is a lot

1672.53 --> 1678.86
to delve into and yeah you just got a

1675.68 --> 1680.6000000000001
taste of that with figuring out the the

1678.86 --> 1682.8799999999999
nature of the mandala affect the

1680.6 --> 1685.76
possibilities what that could be in

1682.88 --> 1691.3700000000001
relation to the spiritual dimension and

1685.76 --> 1692.94
the physical world so there's a lot to

1691.37 --> 1696.6799999999998
learn

1692.94 --> 1696.68
wizard schools open

1697.61 --> 1701.1999999999998
but no Mesmer of please

1709.97 --> 1716.45
yeah that's a good point peanuts Clark

1712.61 --> 1720.529
and that's exactly the principle that I

1716.45 --> 1722.8400000000001
used to go through these dark times in

1720.529 --> 1726.98
my past when the Dark One's approached

1722.84 --> 1729.649
me as soon as I figured it out because

1726.98 --> 1732.98
when it was very young I didn't didn't

1729.649 --> 1735.379
know and I didn't share I didn't tell

1732.98 --> 1737.45
anyone about my dark world experience I

1735.379 --> 1739.309
just thought this is just normal this is

1737.45 --> 1740.24
just the other world in the dream world

1739.309 --> 1742.73
and yeah

1740.24 --> 1744.95
it is what it is and didn't really think

1742.73 --> 1746.98
about the implications of that I just

1744.95 --> 1749.3790000000001
thought it was known everybody had that

1746.98 --> 1753.259
so

1749.379 --> 1759.35
no no saucy long dark ones and no the

1753.259 --> 1762.8
dark ones as in dark spirits yeah

1759.35 --> 1768.53
to be fair right might be because of me

1762.8 --> 1773.33
but yeah they all were white skin so no

1768.53 --> 1776.1499999999999
there's no Negroes involving themselves

1773.33 --> 1786.26
with me as dark entities no they were

1776.15 --> 1790.5700000000002
all pretty much white beards but in

1786.26 --> 1794.06
retrospect again I think that has that

1790.57 --> 1796.4299999999998
that they did has more to do with the

1794.06 --> 1798.74
people that I was dealing with at the

1796.43 --> 1800.3600000000001
time because I really more and more

1798.74 --> 1803.36
think that these entities these

1800.36 --> 1807.8
non-human entities were basically just

1803.36 --> 1811.6699999999998
using these people's skin because they

1807.8 --> 1813.95
lent it from my mind with a certain

1811.67 --> 1816.94
expectation in how I would respond to

1813.95 --> 1821.54
them emotionally so they basically used

1816.94 --> 1826.28
memories of people I knew to manipulate

1821.54 --> 1830.09
me in their appearance very devious but

1826.28 --> 1832.8799999999999
also complex it's not just just evil it

1830.09 --> 1837.8899999999999
is just so complex but I don't think

1832.88 --> 1839.66
they were really these people not not

1837.89 --> 1841.8500000000001
with them knowing it anyway

1839.66 --> 1844.16
because I have confronted some people

1841.85 --> 1846.8899999999999
that I knew about this

1844.16 --> 1849.0500000000002
like as I called him the Jesuit guy

1846.89 --> 1851.63
which is a physical person and I

1849.05 --> 1854.4199999999998
explained already that the first things

1851.63 --> 1857.0600000000002
I saw was him on the other side but it

1854.42 --> 1859.5800000000002
didn't really turn out to be him and he

1857.06 --> 1862.07
didn't understand and I thought he was

1859.58 --> 1865.61
lying about it so yeah make it even more

1862.07 --> 1867.59
complex so yeah there's the Jesuit guy

1865.61 --> 1870.9699999999998
in the real world and then there is the

1867.59 --> 1876.1699999999998
entity that took his skin and that is

1870.97 --> 1878.59
very one of the nasty tanti the entities

1876.17 --> 1878.5900000000001
that I know

1880.97 --> 1883.51
yeah

1884.5 --> 1891.78
anyway Oh complex stuff

1892.68 --> 1896.24
not very flattered he

1908.41 --> 1917.23
at AGM hilarious all I need is pointy

1913.78 --> 1921.34
ears and I'd be Spock well I feel

1917.23 --> 1925.96
honored which is not very [ __ ] by the

1921.34 --> 1929.83
way although I could say you honor me

1925.96 --> 1932.65
but yeah look I think the Vulcans are

1929.83 --> 1936.07
very cool and they are kind of the

1932.65 --> 1941.92
science-fiction else with a culture of

1936.07 --> 1944.07
logic rather than yeah the elven culture

1941.92 --> 1949.23
of Lord of the Rings sources which is

1944.07 --> 1949.23
more Germanic traditionalist and

1952.04 --> 1959.3
I think that the Vulcan logic concept

1955.16 --> 1961.8500000000001
comes more from from Eastern philosophy

1959.3 --> 1963.74
roots that's how it was designed but I

1961.85 --> 1968.87
don't mind I have that in me as well

1963.74 --> 1973.79
you know I'm a Eurasian genetically that

1968.87 --> 1977.11
even means anything but I don't mind

1973.79 --> 1982.75
being compared to a Vulcan and I would

1977.11 --> 1986.1499999999999
find it very cool maybe sometime could

1982.75 --> 1988.1
potentially yeah I wouldn't mind as I'm

1986.15 --> 1991.13
not saying it's a realistic thing when I

1988.1 --> 1994.54
wouldn't mind like actually being a

1991.13 --> 1997.22
falcon in a Star Trek series sometime

1994.54 --> 1998.96
maybe just as an extra I don't know I'm

1997.22 --> 2002.77
probably not suited for that kind of

1998.96 --> 2005.3700000000001
stuff in their opinions but I would love

2002.77 --> 2005.37
to do that

2006.32 --> 2012.6499999999999
I think probably cook although yeah it's

2009.7 --> 2015.28
probably not part of the direction that

2012.65 --> 2015.2800000000002
I'm going

2015.82 --> 2022.4089999999999
yeah I'm looking lily Wazza and I'm not

2018.7 --> 2022.409
gonna shout him out please

2023.609 --> 2027.6899999999998
no no he's a troll right

2031.27 --> 2033.9
No

2059.21 --> 2067.19
Wow after getting all this attention off

2062.1 --> 2067.19
me I'm sorry get hungry now

2078.55 --> 2086.3500000000004
so yeah for anyone who's interested

2082.11 --> 2089.53
pretty much done my thing here you're

2086.35 --> 2093.0
welcome to join my panel but you have to

2089.53 --> 2093.0
do it through the early bird chat

2096.01 --> 2101.3100000000004
so if you're in there you're welcome to

2099.01 --> 2101.3100000000004
join

2105.11 --> 2109.6600000000003
see and a lot of new people contact me

2112.36 --> 2118.6800000000003
a good talk with Szell Szell yesterday

2115.9 --> 2118.6800000000003
know is interesting

2143.58 --> 2151.2599999999998
so let's see what has been happening I

2147.1 --> 2151.2599999999998
need to dig into my memory for a bit

2153.63 --> 2160.37
what happened yesterday what did I watch

2160.64 --> 2173.2799999999997
see seems to be a bit jumbled up since

2169.01 --> 2175.6200000000003
since that hangout about Mandela effect

2173.28 --> 2177.42
but I don't think it's an actual Mandela

2175.62 --> 2181.35
effect I think it's just my response to

2177.42 --> 2184.35
it that made it deprioritize and

2181.35 --> 2187.74
everything that happened before that was

2184.35 --> 2190.83
apparently my instinct told me that was

2187.74 --> 2194.43
very important to put a lot of attention

2190.83 --> 2196.2599999999998
on this so I did that and I did that I'm

2194.43 --> 2202.19
just hanging out I hope you're happy

2196.26 --> 2202.19
subconscious feel bit manipulated but

2202.22 --> 2209.14
apparently that's supposed to happen

2206.27 --> 2209.14
so

2221.95 --> 2225.6699999999996
86 watchin nice

2229.05 --> 2231.86
okay

2232.23 --> 2235.13
let's see

2253.82 --> 2256.75
PTA

2257.16 --> 2263.73
yeah was is not a faker he's just a real

2261.0 --> 2267.93
ball believer and he's a relatively

2263.73 --> 2271.08
decent person for them all right you're

2267.93 --> 2275.6699999999996
not a faker right there but you are

2271.08 --> 2279.39
quite naughty and very very indecent

2275.67 --> 2284.91
when pushed so don't think you're a lot

2279.39 --> 2287.1299999999997
better than was really not not saying

2284.91 --> 2293.97
you're not an interesting guy at times

2287.13 --> 2298.73
if anyway I am open for questions and

2293.97 --> 2298.73
I'm also open for guests so yeah

2300.4 --> 2307.48
but not for Jose yet I'm not ready to

2306.04 --> 2310.0299999999997
deal with that if he has something

2307.48 --> 2312.67
important to share and you can do it on

2310.03 --> 2314.32
his channel or in my chat because as you

2312.67 --> 2317.25
all know he's not blocked

2314.32 --> 2317.25
so I'm chat there

2325.55 --> 2336.15
but logic yes I think I did look but

2329.91 --> 2338.94
very shortly because again information

2336.15 --> 2343.1
overload there's a lot of that

2338.94 --> 2346.89
information overload really because

2343.1 --> 2348.75
things need time to sink in especially

2346.89 --> 2352.0499999999997
if it is completely new very

2348.75 --> 2354.39
concentrated information because it

2352.05 --> 2357.51
requires a lot of attention and focus

2354.39 --> 2360.92
and room in your head to actually

2357.51 --> 2365.9300000000003
approach it properly with my mind and

2360.92 --> 2369.4500000000003
figure out if it is reliable enough and

2365.93 --> 2372.21
look I get confronted with people that I

2369.45 --> 2374.8199999999997
guess recognize my level of intelligence

2372.21 --> 2376.05
and they just shove this thing to me

2374.82 --> 2377.3700000000003
it's like yeah look at this you're

2376.05 --> 2379.23
probably intelligent enough to see that

2377.37 --> 2382.83
but they don't realize that it is

2379.23 --> 2385.17
probably they've been focusing on that

2382.83 --> 2389.1
for a while and they were able to

2385.17 --> 2393.57
assimilate it I can't just do that in

2389.1 --> 2395.88
just a few minutes you know and I I get

2393.57 --> 2398.52
a lot of that stuff and a lot of really

2395.88 --> 2404.67
compact information from people and yes

2398.52 --> 2408.39
I really do appreciate it but I I can't

2404.67 --> 2410.31
be expected to just master it look into

2408.39 --> 2411.5299999999997
it know it and respond right away I'm

2410.31 --> 2414.5499999999997
sorry

2411.53 --> 2419.71
and maybe smart

2414.55 --> 2422.23
one guy and maybe I can look very deep

2419.71 --> 2427.05
and understand quickly but it doesn't

2422.23 --> 2429.46
mean that I can just tolerate overdoses

2427.05 --> 2434.46
dosages of information that's

2429.46 --> 2434.46
unfortunately not within my ability I

2434.7 --> 2439.35
can't take it all at once I need my time

2462.58 --> 2465.58
right

2479.94 --> 2485.009
I get the feeling it's the same troll

2482.789 --> 2488.759
really again man

2485.009 --> 2491.4900000000002
were they freaking tenacious Patricius

2488.759 --> 2494.579
chat yesterday that was insane and I've

2491.49 --> 2497.3999999999996
seen them stalking me here as well so we

2494.579 --> 2500.599
got some real serious stalkers here and

2497.4 --> 2500.599
nasty people out there

2515.87 --> 2520.06
no oh that's a good question let's see

2521.9 --> 2527.6600000000003
yeah and constant again Jose is not

2527.18 --> 2531.7999999999997
locked

2527.66 --> 2534.29
I need him because I just like didn't

2531.8 --> 2536.0600000000004
want to see him I did that so he can

2534.29 --> 2537.5
just talk and chat and he can come on

2536.06 --> 2540.13
the panel but I don't want him on the

2537.5 --> 2543.62
panel right now okay not saying never

2540.13 --> 2546.38
don't want it right now might be kind of

2543.62 --> 2551.0499999999997
obvious why you know I'm kind of tilting

2546.38 --> 2553.9100000000003
here and I don't feel like now letting a

2551.05 --> 2556.7000000000003
pretty confrontational thing that will

2553.91 --> 2558.5899999999997
agitate me very likely in with that

2556.7 --> 2561.02
thank you very much everything has a

2558.59 --> 2564.25
time and a place so don't be a whiny

2561.02 --> 2564.25
pants are they

2568.76 --> 2578.55
they right there can see you look can

2575.31 --> 2581.64
you see that you're there that means

2578.55 --> 2585.42
that I can see you that you're not

2581.64 --> 2587.24
blocked so only people that can't see

2585.42 --> 2593.03
you are the ones that have you blocked

2587.24 --> 2593.0299999999997
so stop dumbass please

2595.7 --> 2603.3289999999997
hey Constance no problem no problem

2598.349 --> 2606.7200000000003
uh so again was it was a good question

2603.329 --> 2608.0890000000004
earlier very generalized question oh

2606.72 --> 2611.1299999999997
yeah saucy London

2608.089 --> 2619.2
are there any conspiracies you do not

2611.13 --> 2621.96
believe in oh yeah but it's a matter of

2619.2 --> 2624.779
how you approach it because I don't

2621.96 --> 2627.569
think that any conspiracies theories

2624.779 --> 2631.17
exist without having some kind of

2627.569 --> 2635.13
element of truth to them but yeah there

2631.17 --> 2638.2490000000003
are vast conspiracy concepts out there

2635.13 --> 2641.4500000000003
lures by their own standards ways of

2638.249 --> 2644.5789999999997
thinking that are absolutely untrue

2641.45 --> 2648.45
provably untrue and people believe it

2644.579 --> 2652.319
anyway it is like the whole outer space

2648.45 --> 2654.509
aliens thing the the globe the globe in

2652.319 --> 2656.67
outer space the the alien agenda that

2654.509 --> 2659.94
they are actual physical beings from

2656.67 --> 2660.329
another planet you know that's not how

2659.94 --> 2663.15
it is

2660.329 --> 2665.369
that could be entities from the other

2663.15 --> 2668.069
dimension manifestations from the

2665.369 --> 2670.049
spiritual realm interdimensional aliens

2668.069 --> 2672.119
that could present them however they

2670.049 --> 2673.799
like and if they choose to look like

2672.119 --> 2677.239
grey aliens then they will look like

2673.799 --> 2680.7
grey aliens if they choose to look like

2677.239 --> 2682.559
the Nordic gods then they freakin look

2680.7 --> 2685.249
like the Nordic gods and if they choose

2682.559 --> 2685.2490000000003
to look like

2685.829 --> 2690.88
yeah a bunch of social justice warrior

2688.69 --> 2693.609
and it could look like I want you so did

2690.88 --> 2695.23
it's completely irrelevant how they look

2693.609 --> 2697.14
they can if they're from the other

2695.23 --> 2700.059
dimension from that place that I know

2697.14 --> 2704.019
then they could and they could manifest

2700.059 --> 2706.509
physically in that way then they can be

2704.019 --> 2708.8799999999997
in any form they choose they just lend

2706.509 --> 2711.249
it from your mind from anyone's mind

2708.88 --> 2715.21
from anyone's design and they can be

2711.249 --> 2717.279
that or yeah they could be extra realm

2715.21 --> 2720.539
Ian they could be from another realm

2717.279 --> 2723.099
from another section of the world and

2720.539 --> 2724.599
then they would definitely be physical

2723.099 --> 2728.23
and there are theories about that that

2724.599 --> 2730.9900000000002
it might be the remnant of the Nazi

2728.23 --> 2733.569
Empire that went underground beyond and

2730.99 --> 2735.279
they have yeah well they're pretty much

2733.569 --> 2738.73
on record had made bail

2735.279 --> 2740.829
UFO like devices so yeah maybe they are

2738.73 --> 2744.029
the ones that are doing that could all

2740.829 --> 2746.319
be but as it is usually presented

2744.029 --> 2750.16
millions from outer space and they're

2746.319 --> 2753.43
contacting the secret surfaces and we're

2750.16 --> 2757.69
gonna first contact blah blah that is

2753.43 --> 2760.029
absolutely [ __ ] that's the cover

2757.69 --> 2762.94
story again that's and that's what a

2760.029 --> 2766.21
conspiracy theory is you're a fake one

2762.94 --> 2770.68
it's a cover story to cover up details

2766.21 --> 2773.38
that actually are real with fake context

2770.68 --> 2775.779
fake setting fake staring into a

2773.38 --> 2779.309
direction that is preferred that is

2775.779 --> 2782.37
socially engineered to make it do that

2779.309 --> 2784.9500000000003
but yeah

2782.37 --> 2788.0699999999997
if it doesn't have any elements of

2784.95 --> 2790.6499999999996
reality to it then it's probably not

2788.07 --> 2793.32
gonna catch on you're just completely

2790.65 --> 2795.6600000000003
out of nowhere silly stories that feel

2793.32 --> 2799.1400000000003
very detached from reality in every way

2795.66 --> 2800.25
it doesn't doesn't touch us we don't

2799.14 --> 2803.0099999999998
care about that

2800.25 --> 2807.54
like yeah we want to hear about stories

2803.01 --> 2809.76
of social relations like even like even

2807.54 --> 2811.58
if there's like a super fantasy story or

2809.76 --> 2815.28
science fiction story if there's no

2811.58 --> 2820.17
normal human relations taking place in

2815.28 --> 2823.2900000000004
that then we get alienated it has a word

2820.17 --> 2825.36
you become alienated because it has to

2823.29 --> 2828.27
have something of reality in it or

2825.36 --> 2832.23
there's it's not gonna touch us and that

2828.27 --> 2836.48
is also how fake conspiracies are

2832.23 --> 2836.48
designed and

2836.55 --> 2846.51
it also will very likely happen when we

2841.79 --> 2849.75
try to reverse-engineer what's going on

2846.51 --> 2851.4900000000002
through grafting together conspiracy

2849.75 --> 2853.92
theories trying to analyze them see

2851.49 --> 2860.99
what's real what is not then even then

2853.92 --> 2863.52
we will be prone to humanize things more

2860.99 --> 2867.93
because that is understandable that is

2863.52 --> 2870.3
logic taught to us but in reality it

2867.93 --> 2873.54
might be a little bit more confusing and

2870.3 --> 2876.3900000000003
complex as I gotta demonstrate it

2873.54 --> 2880.74
earlier in the show if that were the

2876.39 --> 2884.94
case yet it'll help you understand but

2880.74 --> 2890.6899999999996
we ourselves also tend to humanize the

2884.94 --> 2894.69
information potentially beyond truth

2890.69 --> 2898.28
it's a risk but you got to do you can

2894.69 --> 2898.28
only do what you can do you know

2907.28 --> 2914.3900000000003
all right the whole 911 thing my god

2911.87 --> 2917.0499999999997
talk about a multi-layered narrative

2914.39 --> 2920.6
conspiracy theory it's just

2917.05 --> 2925.21
mind-boggling to me the new layers that

2920.6 --> 2927.65
have popped up until it became

2925.21 --> 2930.08
absolutely everything hundred-percent

2927.65 --> 2935.83
faked nothing ever happened

2930.08 --> 2939.86
that's what people are now just like

2935.83 --> 2945.29
come on can't be serious it can't be

2939.86 --> 2951.19
that that's just too far you know I saw

2945.29 --> 2951.19
it I saw it what

2951.84 --> 2956.03
I'm gonna throw you a little ball right

2954.27 --> 2960.24
in your face

2956.03 --> 2964.6800000000003
what if they mandala

2960.24 --> 2967.77
affected 9/11 what if it did actually

2964.68 --> 2971.37
roughly happen maybe not like the

2967.77 --> 2973.89
original story buncha Afghans doing that

2971.37 --> 2978.44
absolutely never that never happened and

2973.89 --> 2978.44
that was always [ __ ] but maybe they

2978.74 --> 2987.12
damage controlled it maybe they made

2982.1 --> 2990.36
retroactive Lee made it more fake it

2987.12 --> 2995.1
kind of feels like that it feels like

2990.36 --> 2998.25
that you thought about that maybe it

2995.1 --> 3000.41
really did all happen but they back

2998.25 --> 3002.69
engineered it through the Mandela effect

3000.41 --> 3004.97
so that actually had totally nothing

3002.69 --> 3009.46
happened which makes it even more

3004.97 --> 3009.4599999999996
baffling that people fell for it

3009.64 --> 3017.42
right well Laurie if you can confirm

3012.68 --> 3018.14
that it did happen entirely how did you

3017.42 --> 3019.7000000000003
confirm it

3018.14 --> 3023.9
were you there do you remember it

3019.7 --> 3026.5099999999998
happening what if that memory no longer

3023.9 --> 3029.98
complies to reality because they changed

3026.51 --> 3029.98
it yeah

3031.32 --> 3035.82
no Issa michalski CERN has absolutely

3033.99 --> 3039.2099999999996
nothing to do with them and that effect

3035.82 --> 3045.6800000000003
is total farce whatever Mandela effect

3039.21 --> 3045.68
is it is not made in this world

3052.41 --> 3057.66
anyway I'm just throwing a throwing out

3055.23 --> 3060.319
concept it's conceptual not claiming

3057.66 --> 3063.66
anything look I just don't

3060.319 --> 3065.759
I've lost track with 9/11 okay I know

3063.66 --> 3071.359
the original story was [ __ ]

3065.759 --> 3071.359
absolutely but I thought it was like

3072.63 --> 3079.05
yeah still thought many people died all

3076.17 --> 3080.94
that and now it's just turning more

3079.05 --> 3084.96
stranger and stranger and I don't know

3080.94 --> 3087.36
anymore I just can tell you know I still

3084.96 --> 3089.94
remember when it happened exactly where

3087.36 --> 3093.7200000000003
I was in my life back then everything

3089.94 --> 3095.91
but what really did happen I just can't

3093.72 --> 3102.81
tell anymore I know what I saw on the

3095.91 --> 3106.23
news I know but I don't know just saying

3102.81 --> 3110.85
look it's just saying if the Mandela

3106.23 --> 3113.01
effect was a reality alteration thing

3110.85 --> 3115.86
that actually does occur that can occur

3113.01 --> 3120.84
then who's to say that they wouldn't do

3115.86 --> 3124.8900000000003
this with 9/11 the more complex reason

3120.84 --> 3127.28
would be why right

3124.89 --> 3130.97
why well

3127.28 --> 3134.0600000000004
maybe I'm thinking inter-dimensionally

3130.97 --> 3138.29
now maybe the ones that actually did

3134.06 --> 3142.66
pull that off are getting to a Judgment

3138.29 --> 3145.67
Day point so they're actually trying to

3142.66 --> 3147.6499999999996
retroactively Lee undo the damage and

3145.67 --> 3151.73
turn it into illusion so they're not

3147.65 --> 3154.9100000000003
held accountable as heavily when they

3151.73 --> 3155.86
are judged maybe by God himself on the

3154.91 --> 3160.99
other side

3155.86 --> 3160.9900000000002
think about that very bizarre isn't it

3161.24 --> 3169.2799999999997
that's me are we

3164.34 --> 3169.28
I go to strange places with theorizing

3178.93 --> 3188.569
yeah stop whining Pete's stop why I can

3184.4 --> 3190.67
I can hear your whiny little voice the

3188.569 --> 3194.41
little girl voice right through there

3190.67 --> 3194.41
just yeah go away

3213.32 --> 3220.6200000000003
and no problem yeah he's not gone just

3216.93 --> 3225.08
time that animal for being whining come

3220.62 --> 3225.08
on where else could he go

3242.05 --> 3245.44
yeah cousins to me were playing around a

3244.93 --> 3248.35
bit

3245.44 --> 3252.01
on the screens thinking about the FPGA

3248.35 --> 3255.3689999999997
yeah so it's talking about Aristarchus

3252.01 --> 3258.7000000000003
and seems to be very obsessed with it so

3255.369 --> 3260.98
we were kind of mean I thought yeah

3258.7 --> 3262.1499999999996
maybe he is like Gollum and Aristarchus

3260.98 --> 3284.4900000000002
is the One Ring

3262.15 --> 3284.4900000000002
it's his precious he'll be back

3289.92 --> 3301.84
as starlets from us our historicals yeah

3297.07 --> 3304.6000000000004
I know I can do Gollum pretty well the

3301.84 --> 3307.21
funny thing is is that Gollum basically

3304.6 --> 3310.54
has a more well-developed voice that is

3307.21 --> 3313.48
exactly like one of the Goblin voices

3310.54 --> 3315.2799999999997
that I use for my games although I don't

3313.48 --> 3317.97
do it anymore because otherwise people

3315.28 --> 3320.53
are just gonna hey is that Gollum

3317.97 --> 3324.4199999999996
immediately now because yeah that voice

3320.53 --> 3324.42
is taken pretty much culturally

3334.91 --> 3337.5389999999998
yeah

3337.96 --> 3341.339
this is my precious

3341.56 --> 3345.42
but fortunately enough I made it

3345.94 --> 3350.349
only one master of this ring

3351.9 --> 3361.2000000000003
Oh God

3358.17 --> 3363.539
come on guys see now that's deviating

3361.2 --> 3366.049
from the path ok that's being attention

3363.539 --> 3366.0490000000004
grab you

3370.45 --> 3374.41
now maybe in this in this kit or

3372.76 --> 3379.9300000000003
something at some point could be funny

3374.41 --> 3384.299
to do that but I'm not just gonna do it

3379.93 --> 3384.299
out of nowhere that's silly

3386.35 --> 3389.0699999999997
yeah

3391.599 --> 3395.9990000000003
Smeagol and Gollum miss Jacklin idea

3396.49 --> 3406.2999999999997
it is definitely part of that design

3398.859 --> 3408.93
concept a Smeagol Gollum are

3406.3 --> 3408.9300000000003
say

3413.85 --> 3420.21
a bipolar multiple personality disorder

3417.55 --> 3426.84
like very emotional based that split up

3420.21 --> 3426.84
so I get that character

3427.67 --> 3435.309
um no that's a 10-point it's not it's

3431.569 --> 3440.0589999999997
not a nine it's not a nine bladed sword

3435.309 --> 3442.329
eight or two or five but nine no it's

3440.059 --> 3442.329
ten

3443.89 --> 3447.8689999999997
to pentagrams in conjunction

3458.059 --> 3466.7400000000002
that's right 10 is perfection and it is

3462.089 --> 3471.0589999999997
the Alpha and the Omega and it is the

3466.74 --> 3475.9199999999996
Sun which is also a spherically the

3471.059 --> 3478.3190000000004
symbol of Christ and this is my

3475.92 --> 3481.4700000000003
spiritual map of the pattern of the

3478.319 --> 3484.92
entire reality physical outer dimension

3481.47 --> 3492.1699999999996
the astral plane and the source and then

3484.92 --> 3492.17
the one outside of it all as many things

3495.22 --> 3505.29
and I didn't even know that when I made

3497.5 --> 3505.29
it 2003 that's when I first designed it

3507.309 --> 3512.23
yeah

3508.84 --> 3515.9500000000003
and that's right this thing has 33

3512.23 --> 3520.2
compartments that's right I didn't even

3515.95 --> 3520.2
know that when I made it so yeah

3522.01 --> 3529.3590000000004
right my sauce alone you're full of good

3526.06 --> 3533.77
questions how far have I traveled well

3529.359 --> 3537.04
as a baby it was just born I was taken

3533.77 --> 3540.73
to America there's still photographs of

3537.04 --> 3541.93
this but that's only time I did went to

3540.73 --> 3544.619
America I got this really awesome

3541.93 --> 3549.22
photograph with my mother holding me and

3544.619 --> 3551.8900000000003
a very obvious Native American with a

3549.22 --> 3555.43
baby together in a photo was really cool

3551.89 --> 3558.3689999999997
it's a nice photo and my mother has fond

3555.43 --> 3562.27
memories of that time well had fond

3558.369 --> 3566.609
memories at that time other than that

3562.27 --> 3575.65
I'd pretty much stuck to Europe mostly

3566.609 --> 3577.54
traveled Germany France Spain Italy at

3575.65 --> 3580.32
one point but I don't have good memories

3577.54 --> 3580.32
of that

3580.97 --> 3586.8489999999997
bizarre even dark world related memories

3584.349 --> 3589.55
tell you about it I think I did share

3586.849 --> 3593.9900000000002
that one time I went there and it was

3589.55 --> 3597.38
always said by my parents I was four I

3593.99 --> 3599.5989999999997
think five no fight it was all during

3597.38 --> 3605.48
that fight a lot of freaky [ __ ] happened

3599.599 --> 3610.099
when it was five and yeah ever since

3605.48 --> 3614.42
that moment I always associated Italian

3610.099 --> 3616.6090000000004
with terror and being miserable it's

3614.42 --> 3617.9900000000002
like that was because of what happened

3616.609 --> 3619.58
there because what they did they

3617.99 --> 3621.7999999999997
basically went on a sort of skiing

3619.58 --> 3625.0299999999997
vacation and I was too little so they

3621.8 --> 3629.4500000000003
dropped me off and I was absolutely

3625.03 --> 3632.75
terrified being in a place where people

3629.45 --> 3634.79
didn't even speak Dutch and my body just

3632.75 --> 3637.099
when I wasn't ready to handle it in

3634.79 --> 3638.72
retrospect they even apologized like yes

3637.099 --> 3641.48
sorry we thought you could probably

3638.72 --> 3644.7799999999997
handle it and you couldn't even sorry

3641.48 --> 3648.14
about that but yeah I had dark world

3644.78 --> 3650.599
nightmares there it was terrible I was

3648.14 --> 3652.609
so in terror that I literally entered

3650.599 --> 3654.4700000000003
the other dimension and basically was

3652.609 --> 3656.119
haunted by a bunch of witches that it

3654.47 --> 3659.0299999999997
would make it I was just feeling

3656.119 --> 3661.7000000000003
vulnerable we're accusing me of [ __ ]

3659.03 --> 3666.349
like you are a terrible person you're

3661.7 --> 3668.1189999999997
destroying everything's like yeah deal

3666.349 --> 3676.599
with it when you're like a five-year-old

3668.119 --> 3676.599
kid you know right so

3678.99 --> 3685.47
yeah I went to Italy once once and the

3683.52 --> 3687.45
rest has mostly been Spain I've been to

3685.47 --> 3690.27
the east coast of Spain very near

3687.45 --> 3693.6
Barcelona was a very special place there

3690.27 --> 3695.55
that we always went to was outside of

3693.6 --> 3697.86
the tourist area a lot because we didn't

3695.55 --> 3700.4700000000003
like that like the raw nature at a

3697.86 --> 3703.02
camping like in the middle of a forest

3700.47 --> 3706.1099999999997
so we would literally in sleeping in a

3703.02 --> 3709.62
tent under pine trees was awesome the

3706.11 --> 3712.6200000000003
fresh air was delightful so very good

3709.62 --> 3717.66
memories of that I had my first kiss

3712.62 --> 3722.52
there my first bizarre experience with

3717.66 --> 3726.3599999999997
girls there yeah I've always associated

3722.52 --> 3730.98
going to Spain with like yeah just

3726.36 --> 3736.01
somehow settling down and just fooling

3730.98 --> 3736.01
around with girls like as a kid

3736.36 --> 3740.77
it's always special time for me because

3738.25 --> 3745.03
in my own country like no everybody

3740.77 --> 3747.52
hated me I so I thought so I felt as in

3745.03 --> 3749.77
school no everybody didn't like me but

3747.52 --> 3757.5099999999998
in other countries yeah everybody loved

3749.77 --> 3761.56
me so it is what it is but I've been in

3757.51 --> 3767.82
my adult life I've been to Spain and to

3761.56 --> 3767.82
Germany a couple of times but yeah

3768.35 --> 3774.23
last time I went over the Dutch border

3771.11 --> 3779.6
was with my ex I went to Germany to wave

3774.23 --> 3782.84
gothic Trevon big big party biggest

3779.6 --> 3785.93
gothic party in the world still going

3782.84 --> 3789.1400000000003
very special also some creepy things

3785.93 --> 3790.8599999999997
here and there but just man think about

3789.14 --> 3797.52
it yeah

3790.86 --> 3800.1600000000003
three days and a city the three drem

3797.52 --> 3801.99
travel it does cost like a couple of

3800.16 --> 3805.83
hundred years to do that then you have

3801.99 --> 3809.85
to arrange a hotel or whatever but my

3805.83 --> 3814.34
god I think like three hundred bends

3809.85 --> 3815.61
playing in the course of three days oh

3814.34 --> 3819.81
yeah

3815.61 --> 3822.33
that's special but yeah after Germany

3819.81 --> 3824.73
after that no I pretty much stuck to the

3822.33 --> 3829.64
Netherlands I've been in the Netherlands

3824.73 --> 3829.64
for at least five years

3830.92 --> 3835.92
way too elaborate answer for a very

3834.04 --> 3841.57
simple question

3835.92 --> 3845.7000000000003
and a world tour well would be

3841.57 --> 3848.86
interesting also feels very scary

3845.7 --> 3851.1699999999996
although I know I am probably much more

3848.86 --> 3853.42
capable of doing that now because I have

3851.17 --> 3855.88
more social skills I have more purpose

3853.42 --> 3858.37
more strength spiritual strength like I

3855.88 --> 3860.6800000000003
can do it if I wanted to if I could

3858.37 --> 3866.92
muster the money for this and I find a

3860.68 --> 3869.1
purpose and I don't know in my mind I

3866.92 --> 3872.17
would definitely somewhere in my life

3869.1 --> 3874.87
once or multiple times loved to travel

3872.17 --> 3877.9300000000003
all over the place especially especially

3874.87 --> 3881.77
the exotic places I want that I want to

3877.93 --> 3885.16
find that secret paradise you know not

3881.77 --> 3887.2599999999998
necessarily be on the poles although

3885.16 --> 3890.98
that would be so awesome if that could

3887.26 --> 3893.6200000000003
be possible but look even in the known

3890.98 --> 3896.8
world the known world

3893.62 --> 3899.08
you know how known is it you know it's

3896.8 --> 3901.6600000000003
just an idea we know it we see that map

3899.08 --> 3906.0099999999998
how well do we really know this world

3901.66 --> 3908.68
there is so much here you know you can

3906.01 --> 3911.8
find unique things in the world that you

3908.68 --> 3913.7999999999997
could find potentially yeah let's just

3911.8 --> 3916.9500000000003
get very are whinnying about this I

3913.8 --> 3921.4900000000002
could potentially in my travels find

3916.95 --> 3923.0499999999997
special nonlinear locations I've talked

3921.49 --> 3925.9599999999996
about this a while ago where you would

3923.05 --> 3929.02
basically in the map travel into a place

3925.96 --> 3930.4900000000002
and the road is longer than is

3929.02 --> 3932.65
technically possible and there might be

3930.49 --> 3935.56
even like a village there that nobody

3932.65 --> 3938.37
knows about that shouldn't be there that

3935.56 --> 3938.37
kind of stuff

3939.31 --> 3949.7
whoof that's something you look spatial

3946.24 --> 3952.0099999999998
non-linearity is gonna be a scientific

3949.7 --> 3955.48
theme throughout my life I absolutely

3952.01 --> 3959.4500000000003
would be so thrilled if I could somehow

3955.48 --> 3965.45
find actual proof and confirmation of

3959.45 --> 3968.8399999999997
the concept in any form so cool so yeah

3965.45 --> 3970.97
traveling love to but I need to be well

3968.84 --> 3976.8500000000004
prepared for that and I will be

3970.97 --> 3980.33
eventually but right now booth it's

3976.85 --> 3982.49
gonna be difficult because yeah I will

3980.33 --> 3986.54
need to be properly prepared with

3982.49 --> 3988.2099999999996
financial backup and the right

3986.54 --> 3990.35
connections the right

3988.21 --> 3993.05
preparations you know you can't just go

3990.35 --> 3994.73
to some country and not be informed

3993.05 --> 3997.4300000000003
about what's going on there and the

3994.73 --> 4000.01
groups and the potential dangers and you

3997.43 --> 4003.94
need to really know somebody they're

4000.01 --> 4006.25
actually somehow otherwise you'd just

4003.94 --> 4009.66
yeah you could run into potential

4006.25 --> 4009.66
Cataclysm you know

4013.25 --> 4019.78
all right it's common ground yeah Alan

4017.599 --> 4024.02
be my count is going down

4019.78 --> 4028.46
Larry's isn't it what you can still help

4024.02 --> 4031.0099999999998
me out ah it's back see it's just going

4028.46 --> 4035.6
it hasn't been under the thousand for a

4031.01 --> 4038.6000000000004
while so it's been up 2026 I don't know

4035.6 --> 4040.43
maybe somebody's just pulling a joke

4038.6 --> 4042.92
through YouTube and just putting it

4040.43 --> 4045.0499999999997
swing up the pendulum thing so it's

4042.92 --> 4048.6800000000003
always going up and down and up and down

4045.05 --> 4053.23
and in actuality it's just steadily

4048.68 --> 4053.23
growing but I'd like to fool around

4057.97 --> 4064.6
I love that name doxxed by Jesus

4070.65 --> 4073.2200000000003
yeah

4081.03 --> 4090.27
but yeah I also realize another thing

4084.15 --> 4092.76
that is the more I do or I put out there

4090.27 --> 4098.04
for more I put my dreams out there the

4092.76 --> 4103.319
more other people out there the more

4098.04 --> 4106.89
they are basically amping up the amounts

4103.319 --> 4110.580000000001
that the quantity of volume of this

4106.89 --> 4113.88
information I'm so fast what's being

4110.58 --> 4116.73
pumped out and it almost feels like it

4113.88 --> 4119.400000000001
is just purely trying to it's a

4116.73 --> 4123.139999999999
discouraging policy just put so much

4119.4 --> 4127.259
crap out there that people are gonna be

4123.14 --> 4128.85
oversaturated like come on and if

4127.259 --> 4131.16
they're oversaturated they won't really

4128.85 --> 4133.410000000001
pay attention and that means that when

4131.16 --> 4136.8589999999995
there's some real stuff there they'll

4133.41 --> 4141.15
bump into they just don't look at it

4136.859 --> 4142.47
because they just don't want they think

4141.15 --> 4144.15
that they can't see the difference

4142.47 --> 4146.64
because they haven't studied it because

4144.15 --> 4149.16
it's all too much for them so I think

4146.64 --> 4150.54
that is the reason why they do that but

4149.16 --> 4152.8189999999995
I think yeah it will be amped up

4150.54 --> 4155.549
unfortunately even more and there be

4152.819 --> 4161.7300000000005
more screaming like come on you have to

4155.549 --> 4163.83
believe this come on yes it is really

4161.73 --> 4166.139999999999
aliens from outer space yes we are

4163.83 --> 4168.63
really going to Mars really really

4166.14 --> 4172.14
really please stop this Flat Earth

4168.63 --> 4176.609
please it's all real it's real it's real

4172.14 --> 4178.71
it's real every day new articles it's

4176.609 --> 4187.109
real it's real it's real it's real you

4178.71 --> 4190.759
must stop doubting it's real right see

4187.109 --> 4190.759
it more and more everywhere

4200.32 --> 4206.95
so yeah but that's what I just did there

4205.15 --> 4210.73
that's literally how it feels now it's

4206.95 --> 4214.12
like really again like another new thing

4210.73 --> 4220.8099999999995
reowww not their news a newspaper thing

4214.12 --> 4225.28
another thing not wow it's so so amazing

4220.81 --> 4227.530000000001
so much so much with so little tie into

4225.28 --> 4231.91
anything it's all the stories all of it

4227.53 --> 4233.49
huge huge library spam amount of complex

4231.91 --> 4235.99
stories all based on this

4233.49 --> 4238.08
presuppositional system everything all

4235.99 --> 4243.7
of it

4238.08 --> 4245.92
massive massive like a death bloom you

4243.7 --> 4248.2
know how some plants when they know

4245.92 --> 4250.6
they're dying they're gonna bloom one

4248.2 --> 4252.57
final time to reproduce to attempt a

4250.6 --> 4258.9400000000005
final reproduction it's almost like that

4252.57 --> 4261.94
maybe it is that I don't know I could be

4258.94 --> 4264.429999999999
from certain perspective from a typical

4261.94 --> 4268.54
flat earther perspective let's call it

4264.43 --> 4273.97
or maybe that's just what we hope it to

4268.54 --> 4278.76
be maybe it is really a real serious

4273.97 --> 4278.76
attempt to grab everyone back

4279.58 --> 4285.61
I don't know

4281.53 --> 4289.0
but I do know and this is this is a kind

4285.61 --> 4293.429999999999
of a warning to everyone the more they

4289.0 --> 4296.5
grab attention and the more we do it a

4293.43 --> 4298.450000000001
more attention grabby the more attention

4296.5 --> 4305.26
grabby we get and the more attention

4298.45 --> 4307.96
grabber they get the more a complete and

4305.26 --> 4312.820000000001
utter rejection of it all will start to

4307.96 --> 4316.3
occur from all sides realize this if it

4312.82 --> 4318.969999999999
just amps up too much from all sides too

4316.3 --> 4321.84
much too much too manipulative from all

4318.97 --> 4324.64
sides from the globe from the media and

4321.84 --> 4326.89
the more flat earthers that are maybe

4324.64 --> 4329.04
getting more desperate or maybe not look

4326.89 --> 4332.71
I'm not saying that that that that is

4329.04 --> 4335.98
absolutely happening just saying if if

4332.71 --> 4339.37
we like Co we have to respond back

4335.98 --> 4341.709999999999
likewise we have to stay on par if we

4339.37 --> 4344.98
amp up that tension the psychological

4341.71 --> 4347.13
tension over the world then there may be

4344.98 --> 4350.82
a response where people will just say I

4347.13 --> 4350.82
don't care anymore

4352.27 --> 4358.27
doesn't matter to me I'm just gonna look

4355.15 --> 4362.98
at this circle around me that's what I

4358.27 --> 4365.830000000001
know don't give a freaking [ __ ] about

4362.98 --> 4368.65
what you think is out there that is

4365.83 --> 4370.3
gonna be among the responses and we

4368.65 --> 4372.16
already know a couple of people here and

4370.3 --> 4375.91
there that kind of seem to have that

4372.16 --> 4378.18
stands in their own way but yeah the

4375.91 --> 4381.21
wider public may also respond like this

4378.18 --> 4384.43
eventually if it if it just gets too bad

4381.21 --> 4386.9800000000005
because it yeah you know it's like

4384.43 --> 4390.76
teaching a kid if you if you're gentle

4386.98 --> 4393.73
with a kid and you're too gentle they

4390.76 --> 4394.93
become this is boring I want to do

4393.73 --> 4398.65
something more interesting

4394.93 --> 4400.72
so okay you get it okay I have to get it

4398.65 --> 4402.49
more interesting what do their ones what

4400.72 --> 4405.22
what will grab their attention so you

4402.49 --> 4408.01
get interesting and yeah they think oh

4405.22 --> 4410.08
this is cool I like this right then

4408.01 --> 4411.91
somebody else comes and like does the

4410.08 --> 4416.71
same thing but tells a different story

4411.91 --> 4419.92
and because like hmm but yeah he also I

4416.71 --> 4422.38
also like him so then these people both

4419.92 --> 4422.68
go yeah but look I'm better that's

4422.38 --> 4425.53
better

4422.68 --> 4427.6
oh you even do more their best more than

4425.53 --> 4429.5199999999995
us more the best and eventually killed

4427.6 --> 4433.780000000001
like you guys are nuts I'm just gonna

4429.52 --> 4439.280000000001
walk away if that's basically what I'm

4433.78 --> 4443.24
trying to trying to yeah

4439.28 --> 4449.66
that wasn't how do you say getting the

4443.24 --> 4452.69
right word you'd see an analogy how that

4449.66 --> 4456.17
would be like do you think that would be

4452.69 --> 4458.839999999999
better than the way it is now what do

4456.17 --> 4464.78
you mean hey Karen

4458.84 --> 4466.79
hey thanks for coming sure I mean do you

4464.78 --> 4469.429999999999
think what what you just described is

4466.79 --> 4476.39
better than the way it's been with

4469.43 --> 4479.02
people just not caring yeah no it would

4476.39 --> 4479.02
be the same

4480.659 --> 4485.61
because in the earlier days people

4482.94 --> 4488.879999999999
didn't care they didn't care much what

4485.61 --> 4491.099999999999
the government would tell them and they

4488.88 --> 4494.639
would be warned by their parents for

4491.1 --> 4500.31
what the TV told them and that would

4494.639 --> 4505.5
basically return and I guess that

4500.31 --> 4507.63
support for the NASA things maybe also

4505.5 --> 4510.389
the flat-earthers I don't know the

4507.63 --> 4513.96
support for exploration anything in any

4510.389 --> 4514.4400000000005
direction it would all die down because

4513.96 --> 4516.63
of that

4514.44 --> 4518.638999999999
and maybe that's a good thing because

4516.63 --> 4524.969
yeah there's a lot to fix about this

4518.639 --> 4529.46
world in our own backyard so but is it

4524.969 --> 4531.81
better I don't know I'm just trying to

4529.46 --> 4533.34
see I don't think it would stay that way

4531.81 --> 4535.2300000000005
though I think it would just be like a

4533.34 --> 4537.4490000000005
transition there's gonna have to be some

4535.23 --> 4538.888999999999
sort of transition right like they're

4537.449 --> 4541.32
not just gonna go people aren't just

4538.889 --> 4542.76
gonna go from believing they live on a

4541.32 --> 4544.82
spinning ball and everything that

4542.76 --> 4548.52
they've been told their whole lives to

4544.82 --> 4550.7699999999995
being like heightened ly heightened

4548.52 --> 4554.27
awareness or enlightenment like that

4550.77 --> 4558.2390000000005
there has to be a transition right oh

4554.27 --> 4562.409000000001
yes there there is there will be like we

4558.239 --> 4565.049999999999
are doing that in our path yeah on a

4562.409 --> 4567.08
very small scale on a very small scale

4565.05 --> 4569.79
though compared to how many you know

4567.08 --> 4572.969
people are still walking around like

4569.79 --> 4575.03
zombies right but hasn't that always

4572.969 --> 4581.639
been like that

4575.03 --> 4586.969
yeah but history forever I guess so well

4581.639 --> 4586.969
I don't know has it I think so

4588.4 --> 4592.53
it's

4590.88 --> 4594.9800000000005
it's yeah it's kind of complicated

4592.53 --> 4594.98
because

4595.249 --> 4601.4
it's all about how straightforward

4597.429 --> 4608.059
culture is and when a culture starts

4601.4 --> 4610.249
adopt lies within common common dealing

4608.059 --> 4613.6990000000005
common social interactions and

4610.249 --> 4615.469
everything then eventually what people

4613.699 --> 4617.78
will portray themselves to be will

4615.469 --> 4619.46
absolutely be nothing like how they

4617.78 --> 4621.018999999999
really are and they'll become really

4619.46 --> 4625.34
good at it and that will be really

4621.019 --> 4627.619000000001
confusing for everyone because yeah if

4625.34 --> 4630.139
everyone is acting different than what

4627.619 --> 4633.259999999999
they are how do you even know what

4630.139 --> 4634.789
realism don't you think people are

4633.26 --> 4635.479
already acting different than they

4634.789 --> 4639.619
really are

4635.479 --> 4642.71
a lot of them are yes because I feel

4639.619 --> 4644.829
like being lied to I wasn't acting the

4642.71 --> 4647.9
way that I should have been or I wasn't

4644.829 --> 4649.549999999999
not knowing who I really was or my place

4647.9 --> 4650.808999999999
in the universe I still don't really

4649.55 --> 4653.269
know that I'm still trying to figure it

4650.809 --> 4656.3
all out but when you've been told a lie

4653.269 --> 4658.1900000000005
and you believe it and you behave a

4656.3 --> 4659.96
certain way you're behaving in a way

4658.19 --> 4663.638999999999
that you shouldn't be behaving because

4659.96 --> 4665.96
you're behaving that way based on a lie

4663.639 --> 4670.249
so I think that most people are already

4665.96 --> 4673.46
doing that but it all depends on how you

4670.249 --> 4676.219
let information influence the course you

4673.46 --> 4678.7390000000005
take that's really the where the

4676.219 --> 4682.999
corruption lies because you can

4678.739 --> 4685.428999999999
entertain something but if that new

4682.999 --> 4687.469
information means that you are going to

4685.429 --> 4690.26
change the direction you're going and

4687.469 --> 4692.119
the approach you have yeah then it's

4690.26 --> 4695.76
definitely damaging but it doesn't

4692.119 --> 4699.299999999999
necessarily have to be the case you know

4695.76 --> 4702.51
it's I can very well imagine that there

4699.3 --> 4702.9890000000005
are people there working on holding the

4702.51 --> 4706.4400000000005
Spain's

4702.989 --> 4715.169999999999
space stuff that are still Christians

4706.44 --> 4716.91
really in a very odd way to us yeah but

4715.17 --> 4720.33
still for the most part their behavior

4716.91 --> 4723.33
is based on a world that they are

4720.33 --> 4725.88
presented with that is a lie right but

4723.33 --> 4729.5
what if they were convinced that they

4725.88 --> 4734.09
needed to do that to prevent a cataclysm

4729.5 --> 4734.09
would it still be is nefarious

4738.109 --> 4747.320000000001
um or would it be less nefarious that's

4744.32 --> 4750.799999999999
literally what I said the same thing as

4747.32 --> 4752.478999999999
what I said yeah it it get it shines a

4750.8 --> 4757.6990000000005
new light on the situation

4752.479 --> 4760.159000000001
yeah okay yeah that I agree so because I

4757.699 --> 4762.709
don't think that a lot of people will

4760.159 --> 4765.138999999999
just very easily surrender to some kind

4762.709 --> 4767.688999999999
of evil madness without a good reason

4765.139 --> 4770.389
they have to be deluded with something

4767.689 --> 4776.899
that from that delusional point of view

4770.389 --> 4780.919
does make sense see otherwise your

4776.899 --> 4783.789000000001
spirit will falter kind of like what

4780.919 --> 4790.3
happens to Hillary every now and then

4783.789 --> 4795.55
yeah because she openly just says no I I

4790.3 --> 4799.789
embrace evil pure no delusions about it

4795.55 --> 4802.519
now in her delusion and no evil eye

4799.789 --> 4804.8589999999995
that's what she does and with the

4802.519 --> 4806.780000000001
consequences that come with it the

4804.859 --> 4810.9490000000005
staggering in the dew malfunctions

4806.78 --> 4814.728999999999
everything so I think that a lot of

4810.949 --> 4817.428999999999
people may be doing things that could

4814.729 --> 4821.419
definitely be considered evil especially

4817.429 --> 4824.419
from the victim part side but for them

4821.419 --> 4826.969
they may be may have been told a story

4824.419 --> 4829.059
like yeah if we don't stop this this is

4826.969 --> 4831.229
what's gonna happen everybody's gonna

4829.059 --> 4833.929
civilizations gonna be destroyed and

4831.229 --> 4839.749000000001
this is also by the way even more in the

4833.929 --> 4842.839
open the I guess false paradigm that is

4839.749 --> 4846.139
presented by for example Alex Jones says

4842.839 --> 4848.689
that says do we all want he said it

4846.139 --> 4852.349
again yesterday does it every time

4848.689 --> 4855.919
do we all just want to die and all just

4852.349 --> 4857.909000000001
go to hell or do we go for the stars and

4855.919 --> 4861.449
space and good

4857.909 --> 4864.57
new glory it's always like it has to be

4861.449 --> 4867.15
this or everything dies no there's

4864.57 --> 4869.789
nothing in between and that's a false

4867.15 --> 4873.209
paradigm but it may be a core element as

4869.789 --> 4875.699
to what is keeping the people upholding

4873.209 --> 4878.579
this illusion in line to keep on going

4875.699 --> 4884.239
it is their religion their religious

4878.579 --> 4884.239
motivation what do you think

4884.98 --> 4890.5199999999995
yeah I could see that I don't agree with

4887.71 --> 4894.22
it obvious course I could see that

4890.52 --> 4899.070000000001
horrible taken to not consider there may

4894.22 --> 4906.64
be something in between right it's it's

4899.07 --> 4909.969999999999
it's it's very short-sighted that's

4906.64 --> 4912.55
what's great I think about this realm

4909.97 --> 4914.41
that we live in it there are just as

4912.55 --> 4918.1
many interpretations of it as there are

4914.41 --> 4926.8
people and everybody can sort of choose

4918.1 --> 4930.42
their own adventure yeah yeah and that

4926.8 --> 4935.05
is kind of special about this age though

4930.42 --> 4938.4
you can choose a very vile adventure as

4935.05 --> 4943.78
well and it's just being allowed

4938.4 --> 4946.75
apparently it's insane goes too far too

4943.78 --> 4948.13
much freedom well yeah there well not

4946.75 --> 4952.9
only are they allowed to but that's

4948.13 --> 4956.7
encouraged yeah well that is the freedom

4952.9 --> 4961.299999999999
to be allowed to encourage that [ __ ] see

4956.7 --> 4964.24
now is that a lot that whether it be the

4961.3 --> 4966.28
receiver of the suggestion dewy acting

4964.24 --> 4968.469999999999
it out or the ones that give the

4966.28 --> 4970.679999999999
suggestion it is being allowed to do

4968.47 --> 4970.68
that

4972.01 --> 4978.039000000001
and people are not properly responding

4975.099 --> 4982.05
to it so it seems or the ones that do

4978.039 --> 4985.268999999999
are being isolated from the top down

4982.05 --> 4988.6900000000005
it's being kept in place that that is

4985.269 --> 4992.349
this is allowed and it is this from a

4988.69 --> 4995.739
human perspective absolute madness with

4992.349 --> 4999.21
no reason but yeah again why are they

4995.739 --> 5001.829
doing that what is the reason for the

4999.21 --> 5004.409
commander to do that have they seen what

5001.829 --> 5007.409
happens if they don't do that what what

5004.409 --> 5010.289
is it what really motivates them to do

5007.409 --> 5011.25
this yeah see this is something that

5010.289 --> 5013.139
I've thought about I've thought about

5011.25 --> 5016.349
that for a long time nobody really has

5013.139 --> 5018.150000000001
an answer there is no definite answer as

5016.349 --> 5018.78
to the why question everybody can

5018.15 --> 5021.539
speculate

5018.78 --> 5023.909
oh they're hiding God oh you know for

5021.539 --> 5026.19
control for power and probably it is a

5023.909 --> 5029.299999999999
little bit of all that but the reality I

5026.19 --> 5031.799999999999
think is that we can't even comprehend

5029.3 --> 5034.860000000001
what it is they're hiding like I think

5031.8 --> 5038.869000000001
if we ever do figure out the real why

5034.86 --> 5038.869
like we're all just gonna be blown away

5039.38 --> 5048.809
yeah but also then again if you got to

5046.23 --> 5051.808999999999
hear the real wide but you've got to

5048.809 --> 5053.820000000001
hear it secondhand through somebody

5051.809 --> 5057.869000000001
telling you them telling you what if

5053.82 --> 5060.119
that could not work if it may be what

5057.869 --> 5062.25
they seem can only work on that maybe it

5060.119 --> 5064.86
is actually complete lie the most

5062.25 --> 5068.34
they've been presented with a super

5064.86 --> 5070.139
super complicated lie that is so

5068.34 --> 5073.309
convincing that nothing can convince

5070.139 --> 5073.309
them of the contrary

5075.289 --> 5081.44
but if you hear what they have to say

5077.69 --> 5085.119
then you might as a outsider just hear

5081.44 --> 5088.129999999999
it and say look but this is inconsistent

5085.119 --> 5089.598999999999
they've been lying this is a lie I can

5088.13 --> 5093.679
point at it right here and there and

5089.599 --> 5095.6900000000005
they'll just crumble in front of you if

5093.679 --> 5096.7390000000005
if you if you would point that out and

5095.69 --> 5099.379999999999
that's probably why they don't tell

5096.739 --> 5103.308999999999
anyone and they're just stuck with that

5099.38 --> 5106.059
and it feels to me sometimes like that

5103.309 --> 5110.329000000001
is exactly what they tried with me

5106.059 --> 5115.400000000001
because they did present fast-fast

5110.329 --> 5117.73
suggestive illusions that if I had went

5115.4 --> 5120.259999999999
with that completely all the way and

5117.73 --> 5122.509999999999
basically did everything that they asked

5120.26 --> 5125.539000000001
of me I would absolutely end up like one

5122.51 --> 5128.329000000001
of these maniac elites exactly like that

5125.539 --> 5130.849
so maybe that's they had they were

5128.329 --> 5134.03
forced or they chose to when go through

5130.849 --> 5138.17
a similar thing and just utterly

5134.03 --> 5140.98
corrupted maybe that is what that is I

5138.17 --> 5140.9800000000005
don't know

5142.32 --> 5148.83
mmm-hmm do you know your blood type

5145.41 --> 5154.4
Arwen it's probably gonna be the giant

5148.83 --> 5154.4
one just giant one what's the giant one

5156.68 --> 5162.39
Rh negative its negative right probably

5159.99 --> 5166.53
I don't know I thought it was like I'm

5162.39 --> 5176.37
Rh negative but it's confusing I think

5166.53 --> 5178.0199999999995
it's like I'm not sure if you're o+ then

5176.37 --> 5179.67
you're not Rh negative because the

5178.02 --> 5182.76
positive or the negative refers to the

5179.67 --> 5186.3
Rh factor that was maybe I'd I'd have to

5182.76 --> 5189.3
look it up I don't know but whatever

5186.3 --> 5191.97
whatever my blood type may be I get the

5189.3 --> 5194.46
feeling that I'm kind of special so I

5191.97 --> 5196.62
don't know well you are regard mean

5194.46 --> 5199.29
having an Rh negative blood type is not

5196.62 --> 5201.51
like a requirement of being a flat

5199.29 --> 5206.64
earther or being special or being awake

5201.51 --> 5208.530000000001
I just ask because most people that I do

5206.64 --> 5210.84
ask who are flat earthers who do know

5208.53 --> 5213.75
their blood type are Rh negative which

5210.84 --> 5216.35
just happens to be the majority which I

5213.75 --> 5216.35
find interesting

5220.62 --> 5226.62
well I don't know I don't know if I am i

5223.82 --> 5231.45
I'd have to look into it I basically

5226.62 --> 5233.73
have to ask my dad I should know what

5231.45 --> 5235.23
yeah it's like a hospital thing and I

5233.73 --> 5236.759999999999
don't well most people don't know

5235.23 --> 5238.139999999999
actually it's not uncommon for people

5236.76 --> 5239.37
not to know because most of the time

5238.14 --> 5241.860000000001
people don't need to know their blood

5239.37 --> 5244.26
type you really I mean it's just not

5241.86 --> 5247.95
something that comes up very often a lot

5244.26 --> 5249.360000000001
of people don't know right I didn't know

5247.95 --> 5256.95
the only reason I know is because they

5249.36 --> 5258.54
gave birth to children yeah it's kind of

5256.95 --> 5262.83
important to know when you're planning

5258.54 --> 5265.08
to get children too so yeah I had to get

5262.83 --> 5269.04
the rhogam shot because I'm Rh negative

5265.08 --> 5271.62
oh that's that's how I know because they

5269.04 --> 5275.13
give that they give something called a

5271.62 --> 5277.5
rhogam shot to mothers who are Rh

5275.13 --> 5279.12
negative because if you're an Rh

5277.5 --> 5281.16
negative mother and you're carrying a

5279.12 --> 5286.29
fetus that could possibly be Rh positive

5281.16 --> 5288.93
and your body somehow detects that the

5286.29 --> 5291.87
fetus is Rh positive the mother's body

5288.93 --> 5294.72
will will make antibodies to attack that

5291.87 --> 5297.44
fetus like the body your body will

5294.72 --> 5302.64
literally try to kill your own baby

5297.44 --> 5305.19
which is bizarre I mean that's that's

5302.64 --> 5307.89
very telling I don't know what it all

5305.19 --> 5311.089999999999
means but yeah it means that probably

5307.89 --> 5315.62
we've been cross bred in a way that's

5311.09 --> 5315.62
it's a miracle that it still works

5317.73 --> 5323.959999999999
ever consider that that maybe we are

5320.37 --> 5327.09
indeed like the human crossover results

5323.96 --> 5329.91
yeah where they don't work on Giants and

5327.09 --> 5332.9400000000005
they actually don't really mix so

5329.91 --> 5335.79
somehow it kind of works but still like

5332.94 --> 5338.879999999999
genetic opposition's can bump into each

5335.79 --> 5339.48
other and just say nope that's not gonna

5338.88 --> 5343.31
work

5339.48 --> 5343.3099999999995
maybe it's something like that

5348.59 --> 5355.37
but it is very odd that that does happen

5351.07 --> 5358.19
yeah well they don't know what why there

5355.37 --> 5361.96
is an Rh negative factor it's that

5358.19 --> 5365.0599999999995
doesn't exist in any other species right

5361.96 --> 5375.17
it's only in humans and it's only in

5365.06 --> 5377.900000000001
like 15% of humans so it is very no no

5375.17 --> 5379.52
no I've been looking into it for a long

5377.9 --> 5381.349999999999
time ever since I found out I was Rh

5379.52 --> 5384.35
negative I wanted to know about it and

5381.35 --> 5386.51
everything that they discovered it in

5384.35 --> 5388.58
the 40s from what I can tell and then

5386.51 --> 5391.58
they developed the rogram shot to

5388.58 --> 5393.26
prevent pregnancies from failing as a

5391.58 --> 5395.84
result of it

5393.26 --> 5399.320000000001
where it came from why it happens what

5395.84 --> 5409.7300000000005
the origin of it is unknown completely

5399.32 --> 5413.99
unknown it is odd it's interesting I'll

5409.73 --> 5416.75
aspected it into us I don't know I hate

5413.99 --> 5418.82
the Mendel effect yeah no I hate it's

5416.75 --> 5423.59
the answer to everything and it makes

5418.82 --> 5430.4
everything great I know I ranted about

5423.59 --> 5433.43
it for an hour sort of yeah I don't like

5430.4 --> 5436.879999999999
them and Ella are either but it is it

5433.43 --> 5440.780000000001
requires consideration in my in what I

5436.88 --> 5443.900000000001
do so I did that and I will consult

5440.78 --> 5446.24
further I will lay out my theory about

5443.9 --> 5449.0
that physical might change what the

5446.24 --> 5450.8
spiritual will not and I will lay that

5449.0 --> 5451.97
in front of my healer and see what he

5450.8 --> 5453.71
has to say about it

5451.97 --> 5456.5
it might be right

5453.71 --> 5460.84
I might actually be right at that I

5456.5 --> 5460.84
don't know I will find out soon enough

5462.7 --> 5469.8
but anyway well I'm going for some time

5470.16 --> 5476.22
time flies

5473.07 --> 5476.219999999999
ninety minutes

5477.17 --> 5479.86
so

5482.44 --> 5489.91
yeah blood types any other admission

5487.69 --> 5492.669999999999
relating to that I was just looking in

5489.91 --> 5494.62
the chat somebody was saying it's not

5492.67 --> 5497.2
true my sister's Rh negative but my

5494.62 --> 5500.5599999999995
nephew is not yeah Rh negative mom's can

5497.2 --> 5502.99
give birth to Rh positive babies but it

5500.56 --> 5505.6
it happens it's not like it doesn't ever

5502.99 --> 5508.3
work that's what the rhogam shot is for

5505.6 --> 5510.9400000000005
like you can do they that you an Rh

5508.3 --> 5513.88
negative mom can give birth without the

5510.94 --> 5516.759999999999
shot to the her first Rh positive baby

5513.88 --> 5518.9800000000005
but after that her body has developed

5516.76 --> 5521.5
the antibodies to the Rh positive blood

5518.98 --> 5522.969999999999
type and the second baby is gonna is the

5521.5 --> 5524.89
one that's gonna have the problems and

5522.97 --> 5527.56
that's where you need to have the shot

5524.89 --> 5530.47
right that makes sense because at first

5527.56 --> 5533.59
it's completely covered up in the womb

5530.47 --> 5535.96
and like it's separated but then when

5533.59 --> 5537.85
it's born yeah it's gonna break there's

5535.96 --> 5539.38
probably gonna be blood and that's gonna

5537.85 --> 5541.990000000001
be absorbed by the skin and everything

5539.38 --> 5544.54
and then the immune response starts up

5541.99 --> 5550.889999999999
right yeah that makes sense that makes

5544.54 --> 5550.89
sense yes good to know

5553.46 --> 5565.62
yeah if you shout out to ace MacLeod you

5562.29 --> 5569.82
just showed up in chat yeah you're not

5565.62 --> 5572.22
getting a ranch ace you gotta show your

5569.82 --> 5574.67
face more often and see interesting

5572.22 --> 5574.67
things

5590.139 --> 5593.8
and then so the other way around

5591.789 --> 5597.3
happened with my sister what other way

5593.8 --> 5597.3
around what do you mean Voynich

5607.74 --> 5611.849999999999
I'm curious what he's talking about he's

5610.02 --> 5614.240000000001
talking about his sister and having

5611.85 --> 5614.240000000001
babies

5624.409 --> 5630.15
anyway yeah you can look up stuff about

5627.559 --> 5633.51
rh-negative online and it's there's so

5630.15 --> 5637.23
much crazy stuff it's like they'll say

5633.51 --> 5638.369000000001
that it's like a result of like the

5637.23 --> 5641.879999999999
Anunnaki

5638.369 --> 5644.549999999999
you know geoengineering humans way back

5641.88 --> 5647.309
in the day or some people think it's

5644.55 --> 5651.150000000001
that from the Nephilim some people will

5647.309 --> 5654.749
tell you that it's that it's like

5651.15 --> 5658.289
because in the Garden of Eden Eve had

5654.749 --> 5663.179
sex with Satan and so the Rh negative is

5658.289 --> 5665.34
like the demon seed of Satan or some

5663.179 --> 5667.38
people think it's fallen angels like and

5665.34 --> 5671.28
I don't know what it is who knows what

5667.38 --> 5673.53
it is but there's something weird to it

5671.28 --> 5675.329
and a lot of the and the elite families

5673.53 --> 5677.518999999999
are all Rh negative and like that's why

5675.329 --> 5682.44
they do their inbreeding to keep the Rh

5677.519 --> 5684.4800000000005
negative blood pure that's which is

5682.44 --> 5685.86
interesting too because then last time I

5684.48 --> 5688.049999999999
mom was here we were talking about our

5685.86 --> 5690.929
ancestry and it turns out that I might

5688.05 --> 5694.889
have family ties back to the Spanish

5690.929 --> 5696.63
royal family and actually Spain is one

5694.889 --> 5701.789
of the highest concentrations of Rh

5696.63 --> 5704.719
negative blood and also Morocco that's

5701.789 --> 5708.09
very typical because I do find a lot of

5704.719 --> 5710.039
Spanish girls very attractive well

5708.09 --> 5714.150000000001
that's also because I went to vacation

5710.039 --> 5716.179
there all the time I guess but good to

5714.15 --> 5716.179
know

5720.709 --> 5729.059
boy that's why are you calling me a

5722.969 --> 5737.249
witch there's no need to be nasty I was

5729.059 --> 5738.059
trying to find what you were saying he

5737.249 --> 5740.5689999999995
called me a witch

5738.059 --> 5740.569
I don't know why

5746.089 --> 5752.389
all right yeah

5748.829 --> 5756.59
that's hard the word which is become so

5752.389 --> 5760.04
the place it has become in one hand a

5756.59 --> 5762.42
representation of a the female

5760.04 --> 5766.38
personification of evil on the other

5762.42 --> 5769.7390000000005
hand yeah this very there's also the the

5766.38 --> 5773.21
fairy godmother type which which

5769.739 --> 5775.468999999999
obviously is not evil so it's all about

5773.21 --> 5778.17
perspective on the whole ordeal you know

5775.469 --> 5780.42
are you like fundamentalist Christian

5778.17 --> 5782.67
yeah then which anything magic anything

5780.42 --> 5785.639
out of the ordinary if you don't just

5782.67 --> 5787.829
want to worship your husband and have

5785.639 --> 5789.869
kids then you're a witch like that

5787.829 --> 5794.549999999999
that's like the super hardcore old

5789.869 --> 5795.9
shitty fundamentalism so yeah you could

5794.55 --> 5798.059
be a witch and then it would always be

5795.9 --> 5799.888999999999
evil but yeah in the modern sense what

5798.059 --> 5802.469
is it you know yeah there's absolutely

5799.889 --> 5805.619
evil witches that just abuse their

5802.469 --> 5808.44
insight abuse their social skills abuse

5805.619 --> 5810.57
ethereal skills there's also people that

5808.44 --> 5814.11
do exact the opposite and they're just

5810.57 --> 5820.009999999999
very nice and try to be teachers to

5814.11 --> 5820.009999999999
others and protectors and so you know

5821.979 --> 5828.070000000001
yeah I think some the witch couldn't be

5824.139 --> 5830.8
a Christian so I'm very much a motherly

5828.07 --> 5833.11
type person maybe because I am a mom in

5830.8 --> 5842.53
real life and I just can't turn it off

5833.11 --> 5847.959
so I'm just always a mom right well it's

5842.53 --> 5853.179
just a portent part of of your social

5847.959 --> 5856.179
identity then just like I have this very

5853.179 --> 5859.65
strong impulse to be act and act like a

5856.179 --> 5862.179
teacher or father a father like teacher

5859.65 --> 5867.61
yes I don't know if people accept that

5862.179 --> 5873.579
but yeah those are two things that I

5867.61 --> 5879.28
that I love to do not all people love

5873.579 --> 5883.57
that about me of course but yeah so

5879.28 --> 5886.21
I don't see anything wrong with with

5883.57 --> 5889.75
being motherly or fatherly it's just a

5886.21 --> 5892.66
form of care yeah I mean that's that's

5889.75 --> 5896.91
just it I just care a lot I naturally

5892.66 --> 5900.03
have this tendency to want to nurture

5896.91 --> 5901.33
Kerala that's why you're called Karen

5900.03 --> 5906.58
yeah

5901.33 --> 5907.23
yes exactly you're just caring all over

5906.58 --> 5910.93
the place

5907.23 --> 5914.2
Karen yes from Cara and Latin meaning to

5910.93 --> 5928.990000000001
care really yeah I didn't realize that

5914.2 --> 5932.7699999999995
okay very much like that yeah Constance

5928.99 --> 5938.32
is great well she's a mom too but that's

5932.77 --> 5942.910000000001
also part of what women are that's our

5938.32 --> 5944.469999999999
side of the of the yin-yang right that's

5942.91 --> 5948.91
what we're here to do is to love and

5944.47 --> 5952.42
nurture and care that's just a natural

5948.91 --> 5954.07
thing for women to do I think not that

5952.42 --> 5956.35
it's like the rule I mean there's some

5954.07 --> 5961.8099999999995
women that aren't very nurturing but I

5956.35 --> 5964.75
think in general right yeah it's just a

5961.81 --> 5969.01
possibility that comes with a lot of

5964.75 --> 5971.98
strength and responsibility oh yeah it's

5969.01 --> 5973.780000000001
an option just like all men have their

5971.98 --> 5979.0689999999995
own directions that they can take and

5973.78 --> 5981.559
have similar effects like being a father

5979.069 --> 5988.249000000001
if you take that role seriously yeah

5981.559 --> 5989.929
that can really show so Chris berry

5988.249 --> 5994.129
Karen are you trying to assume your own

5989.929 --> 5999.799
sexual identity yes I identify as a

5994.129 --> 6011.979
woman a natural woman who gives birth to

5999.799 --> 6020.429
children who likes men no can't be

6011.979 --> 6026.729
seriously that's unnatural according to

6020.429 --> 6026.729
modern-day social justice warrior lore

6028.319 --> 6034.829000000001
yeah being heterosexual is a and natural

6031.829 --> 6034.829
yeah

6039.78 --> 6050.86
no but yeah I'd you know I think anyone

6046.84 --> 6054.1900000000005
has a choice to go in any direction but

6050.86 --> 6058.32
yeah we have certain mechanisms

6054.19 --> 6062.11
programmed within our physical being

6058.32 --> 6063.969999999999
that will bear strong fruits when you go

6062.11 --> 6066.4
that path when you go the right hand

6063.97 --> 6068.530000000001
path and do it right if you want to

6066.4 --> 6071.679999999999
deviate you can do that and you can be

6068.53 --> 6073.54
very out there very different but yeah

6071.68 --> 6077.950000000001
you will not get be getting those fruits

6073.54 --> 6081.5199999999995
and eventually the the stem to grow that

6077.95 --> 6085.0
may wither away and you'll be less for

6081.52 --> 6087.820000000001
it so it's your choice that's the truth

6085.0 --> 6093.34
that's the reality about it yeah you

6087.82 --> 6096.4
could be a weird freaky transsexual pedo

6093.34 --> 6099.25
even if you want what not saying that I

6096.4 --> 6101.17
tolerate that but you can go as crazy as

6099.25 --> 6103.9
you like but the crazier you go the

6101.17 --> 6106.35
further away you step away from this

6103.9 --> 6109.99
inherent blueprint that is just there

6106.35 --> 6115.05
naturally and you will not be getting

6109.99 --> 6115.05
the fruits of that it's very simple

6117.32 --> 6124.849999999999
ya know in the trunk making a move on

6121.7 --> 6128.48
care and be okay I know I know I don't I

6124.85 --> 6130.43
have a thought poking trying it's not

6128.48 --> 6134.209999999999
kind you have a conversation about men

6130.43 --> 6137.06
and women between a man and a woman in a

6134.21 --> 6139.34
mature way and then it's all the little

6137.06 --> 6140.09
children that have to turn it into

6139.34 --> 6145.7
something it's not

6140.09 --> 6148.64
right look that's the reason why you why

6145.7 --> 6152.29
we have why you have to be a lesbian and

6148.64 --> 6154.85
I have to be a gay because otherwise

6152.29 --> 6156.53
yeah everybody's going to be fair with

6154.85 --> 6158.120000000001
or they're gonna make out are they gonna

6156.53 --> 6160.099999999999
make out are they actually courting each

6158.12 --> 6164.36
other they'll get obsessed over it so we

6160.1 --> 6167.150000000001
have to be gay for their protection see

6164.36 --> 6170.9
so they can just stop getting distracted

6167.15 --> 6172.61
by that over-sexualization mania that

6170.9 --> 6174.44
seems to be running in there in a lot of

6172.61 --> 6177.83
people right now so they can actually

6174.44 --> 6182.509999999999
focus on the conversation so Karen are

6177.83 --> 6190.66
you now lesbian I just I can't even say

6182.51 --> 6190.66
it as a joke I can't do it I want either

6191.11 --> 6197.42
if other people want to pretend I am to

6195.29 --> 6197.96
make themselves more comfortable you go

6197.42 --> 6199.85
right ahead

6197.96 --> 6205.43
what you think of me is none of my

6199.85 --> 6208.070000000001
business nope yeah we don't have to go

6205.43 --> 6211.1900000000005
there and look guys I talked about this

6208.07 --> 6214.88
before I am not gay I am not homosexual

6211.19 --> 6218.15
and I tried it out not very far but I

6214.88 --> 6220.46
kissed a guy once that didn't even look

6218.15 --> 6223.19
like a woman really and it made me

6220.46 --> 6224.96
physically nauseated almost threw up

6223.19 --> 6230.929999999999
literally and I liked the guy I

6224.96 --> 6232.52
respected him so no I am not gay cannot

6230.93 --> 6235.85
be it's physically impossible

6232.52 --> 6237.370000000001
I would simply just break if I'd even

6235.85 --> 6240.46
tried something like that

6237.37 --> 6243.4
just crash no not gay nothing my

6240.46 --> 6247.24
blueprints not gonna happen nobody can

6243.4 --> 6249.91
imagine about it all your life you can

6247.24 --> 6252.16
make yo e pictures with your favorite

6249.91 --> 6255.94
Arwen character and somebody else if you

6252.16 --> 6259.75
like but in reality I will never be in a

6255.94 --> 6270.46
gay relationship okay ever sorry

6259.75 --> 6272.74
never gonna happen how many guys can say

6270.46 --> 6275.47
that that they actually have proof they

6272.74 --> 6277.09
are not gay yeah I mean I had an

6275.47 --> 6280.21
experience like that too I had a

6277.09 --> 6282.1
girlfriend of mine kissed me at a show

6280.21 --> 6285.1
and I was like really taken back by it

6282.1 --> 6288.75
and that's when I realized that I didn't

6285.1 --> 6288.75
have any sexual attraction to women

6289.92 --> 6307.8
Wazza off to bed now god ace MacLeod gay

6299.26 --> 6307.8
is so brilliant yep

6308.19 --> 6315.16
conservatism is the new counterculture I

6310.9 --> 6319.45
know I know so edgy to be old-fashioned

6315.16 --> 6321.91
and basic natural right hands paths

6319.45 --> 6327.76
nowadays yeah I has always been like

6321.91 --> 6330.51
that sort of I guess mix in my physical

6327.76 --> 6333.229
being and my axe and my parents ID I

6330.51 --> 6336.59
don't know I don't know anyway

6333.229 --> 6338.599
I'm also very liberal in some ways so I

6336.59 --> 6340.999
just say okay look I'm just the middle

6338.599 --> 6343.82
route I'm a libertarian I follow certain

6340.999 --> 6348.079
principles of freedom freedom without

6343.82 --> 6350.299999999999
damage and responsible management and

6348.079 --> 6353.929
corruption control and that is basically

6350.3 --> 6358.55
the fundamental my expressions whatever

6353.929 --> 6363.579
I try to do so yeah not really a

6358.55 --> 6363.579000000001

up you know so no thank you

6415.699 --> 6421.79
I'll just buy the really cheap ass razor

6418.34 --> 6424.610000000001
blades that costs maybe a quarter of

6421.79 --> 6427.19
Gillette and we're perfectly fine and

6424.61 --> 6429.11
lasts a very long time thank you very

6427.19 --> 6431.65
much I take the cheap [ __ ] and it works

6429.11 --> 6431.65
a lot better

6433.939 --> 6442.400000000001
yeah there's like cuz you can join the

6435.949 --> 6445.909
Dollar Shave Club right take it back

6442.4 --> 6452.179
unfortunately I just figured out that my

6445.909 --> 6455.499
cheap as razor blades are from us that's

6452.179 --> 6461.63
not good I didn't know what I bought it

6455.499 --> 6464.829
damn it's okay anyway yeah I'm not gonna

6461.63 --> 6464.829
be a thank you very much

6467.38 --> 6471.789
that was kind of quite anticlimactic

6474.61 --> 6478.099999999999
[Laughter]

6482.219 --> 6488.85
also silly and yeah I guess to get into

6486.449 --> 6490.7699999999995
some stupid [ __ ] stuff Alex Jones

6488.85 --> 6493.08
talks about regularly like every time

6490.77 --> 6495.4800000000005
some crazy [ __ ] goes berserk again

6493.08 --> 6497.88
it's always like the subject of the day

6495.48 --> 6503.0
and it's of course very amusing there's

6497.88 --> 6506.85
like this one big bloke guy with blonde

6503.0 --> 6510.38
long hair that identifies as a woman and

6506.85 --> 6513.06
she's she's become notorious now and

6510.38 --> 6515.4890000000005
that looks just like oh yeah it kind of

6513.06 --> 6518.370000000001
looks like he-man you know and of course

6515.489 --> 6520.129999999999
I'm just a madman but he was like yeah

6518.37 --> 6530.909
it's not the right name and he was just

6520.13 --> 6537.12
I knew it man but it's obvious what

6530.909 --> 6543.299999999999
she's called it's he-man mistresses of

6537.12 --> 6550.11
the universe yeah so obvious she's a man

6543.3 --> 6553.1
I don't understand why he didn't just

6550.11 --> 6553.099999999999
right away get that

6555.32 --> 6561.349
but yeah that that transsexual lady

6558.769 --> 6565.039000000001
really does kind of look like he met

6561.349 --> 6568.25
it's hilarious like really big built

6565.039 --> 6570.92
kind of muscly and that weird half long

6568.25 --> 6577.329
hair exactly like he meant so it's

6570.92 --> 6577.329
amazing how memes make themselves

6580.46 --> 6586.7300000000005
man we've been going for two hours Wow

6587.289 --> 6590.28
it's a long one

6595.61 --> 6598.98
anything else

6597.06 --> 6603.330000000001
maybe the whole she-man thing is a

6598.98 --> 6604.19
little silly to end out on its got

6603.33 --> 6608.97
anything else

6604.19 --> 6610.62
Cara I I don't know I just I don't I

6608.97 --> 6612.6
don't know everybody was telling me to

6610.62 --> 6624.8
join so I joined and then I got called a

6612.6 --> 6624.8
witch yeah oh I forget no I forget now

6633.02 --> 6640.780000000001
mm okay yeah but don't call my panel

6637.58 --> 6643.61
members of which thank you very much

6640.78 --> 6651.259999999999
what if I am a witch what if I'm a good

6643.61 --> 6654.95
witch well then it should be emphasized

6651.26 --> 6657.89
that that is the case and not just like

6654.95 --> 6659.8099999999995
a negative raw accusation no I'm not a

6657.89 --> 6663.89
witch though I don't I don't identify as

6659.81 --> 6668.81
a which identifies I don't cast spells

6663.89 --> 6670.910000000001
or anything like that but if I was a

6668.81 --> 6687.410000000001
witch I'd be a good witch I'd be a white

6670.91 --> 6691.49
witch yes if I was what what is it all

6687.41 --> 6693.44
you know it is like witch like which the

6691.49 --> 6695.63
only thing that matters is the path that

6693.44 --> 6699.53
you take and whatever you're gonna grab

6695.63 --> 6701.89
with that everything has consequences so

6699.53 --> 6704.679999999999
yeah

6701.89 --> 6706.81
I see myself kind of like a shaman at

6704.68 --> 6709.51
times although I don't go I'm not

6706.81 --> 6711.820000000001
traditional I'm just I'm completely

6709.51 --> 6714.43
eclectic I have been for over 20 years

6711.82 --> 6717.849999999999
completely eclectic and that sounds yeah

6714.43 --> 6720.43
if I am almost like a wizard but

6717.85 --> 6723.64
self-made just figuring it out

6720.43 --> 6728.860000000001
everything and trying to grab as wide as

6723.64 --> 6734.43
I can and I do it in the lights like

6728.86 --> 6734.429999999999
Gandalf the White because white is good

6736.62 --> 6741.88
although I do wear black but I do that

6739.93 --> 6743.37
at the same time because I don't think

6741.88 --> 6748.0
I'm ever going to really have white hair

6743.37 --> 6750.19
I open up and like how it looks and I

6748.0 --> 6754.44
always think that because I wear black

6750.19 --> 6757.54
in the physical world that my light is

6754.44 --> 6760.0599999999995
emphasized because I wear black youth

6757.54 --> 6763.48
you look more at my face and not my

6760.06 --> 6764.269
attire so it does have a function in

6763.48 --> 6767.419999999999
that sense

6764.269 --> 6770.3
I hope to emphasize the purity of my

6767.42 --> 6775.61
spirit by sobering my look and that is

6770.3 --> 6778.13
in a way a Protestant thing so I do

6775.61 --> 6780.17
identify a little bit with Protestantism

6778.13 --> 6783.07
although not really with the church

6780.17 --> 6783.07
culture of that

6783.729 --> 6790.869000000001
and I sympathize with a lot of things as

6787.059 --> 6794.469
again I graphed all type of things from

6790.869 --> 6798.808999999999
everywhere and just make it my own make

6794.469 --> 6802.329
make it even more purposeful give it

6798.809 --> 6805.719
make it a building block in a really

6802.329 --> 6807.249
good structure so every part of it is

6805.719 --> 6809.11
valuable that's what I'm trying to

6807.249 --> 6812.86
achieve with with my being in my life

6809.11 --> 6816.789
and the path that I take so that's a

6812.86 --> 6819.969
much better note to round it out on so

6816.789 --> 6822.809
yeah I agree indeed thank you Karen for
