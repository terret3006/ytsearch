[Music]

62.0 --> 69.479

93.36 --> 96.2
be much appreciated

96.24 --> 100.88
so whether today again is

101.579 --> 104.65899999999999
pretty amazing

106.68 --> 113.47900000000001
but there has been a lot of trailing

109.74 --> 113.479
really stood out to me this morning

113.52 --> 118.56
and so there is a bit of a haze up there

115.86 --> 120.96
and it even seems to be sort of forming

118.56 --> 123.06
clouds a little

120.96 --> 126.619
yeah but despite that it's almost

123.06 --> 126.619
entirely wind still

126.719 --> 132.739
and still plenty of some coming through

129.119 --> 132.739
so it's kinda hot

136.5 --> 139.92
yeah really

138.239 --> 144.31900000000002
hot

139.92 --> 144.319
late summer's day again

155.28 --> 160.2
all right

157.08 --> 164.04000000000002
hello is Gadget inspector first in chat

160.2 --> 167.06
indeed return to normal PJ creeshank

164.04 --> 167.06
how y'all doing

168.48 --> 175.879
it's Monday the 6th of September 2021

182.64 --> 187.98
wow you guys are in early

185.76 --> 191.22
normally on Monday everybody's like

187.98 --> 194.06
comes in half an hour later but yeah

191.22 --> 194.06
it's good to see you

195.42 --> 198.07999999999998
ah

198.9 --> 205.34
yeah yesterday's shows was

202.5 --> 205.34
really good

205.379 --> 210.89999999999998
oh

207.72 --> 213.239
I forgot I forgot

210.9 --> 215.659
put in Adam's thumbnail now I remember

213.239 --> 215.659
it

216.78 --> 222.299
I broke your heart a thumbnail from him

219.599 --> 226.04
yesterday evening but then I completely

222.299 --> 226.04000000000002
forgot to upload it

226.7 --> 231.0
right I watched back yesterday's show

229.68 --> 235.92000000000002
and

231.0 --> 240.42
like damn that was good I but

235.92 --> 242.45899999999997
I can potentially understand if

240.42 --> 244.85999999999999
quite a few people had a lot of trouble

242.459 --> 247.5
following what I was talking about

244.86 --> 250.799
because I was just really heavy into

247.5 --> 252.54
fractal explaining like so heavy that

250.799 --> 255.739
it's kind of easy

252.54 --> 255.739
to lose track

255.78 --> 262.919
if you slip in the grip

259.38 --> 265.44
but yeah well I can definitely maintain

262.919 --> 267.35999999999996
that grip so watching it back it's just

265.44 --> 270.5
like wow

267.36 --> 270.5
that was heavy

272.82 --> 276.259
and I'm doing okay

278.88 --> 286.32
right Spirit mechanics

282.0 --> 288.0
like by now I should put another hashtag

286.32 --> 291.8
in the list

288.0 --> 291.8
with Spirit mechanics

294.3 --> 299.66
because it is really a new thing that

296.639 --> 299.66
I'm addressing

300.24 --> 303.08
right anyway

316.44 --> 323.34
by all by accident open up a bottle of

320.46 --> 326.21999999999997
Jameson okay

323.34 --> 327.78
sure by accident

326.22 --> 331.34000000000003
oh

327.78 --> 331.34
as long as you had fun with it

341.99 --> 347.479
[Music]

343.38 --> 347.479
a Dutch sailor good to see you

350.94 --> 356.699
right right away

353.1 --> 359.34000000000003
my subscriber amount has like really

356.699 --> 362.58000000000004
moved up

359.34 --> 366.35999999999996
in kind of a spurt I knew it it's an

362.58 --> 368.52
elastic effect right they held it back

366.36 --> 370.97900000000004
and then they kind of Let It Go and then

368.52 --> 373.979
like well it continued shooting up so

370.979 --> 376.5
now I'm at 2023

373.979 --> 378.18
and even mentioning it might bring it

376.5 --> 379.8
down a little again

378.18 --> 382.46
but still

379.8 --> 382.46000000000004
yeah

383.039 --> 388.46
don't think it's gonna get under the uh

385.5 --> 388.46
2000 again

389.16 --> 395.18
and it shouldn't because I've well met a

392.52 --> 395.18
lot of new people

395.699 --> 400.44
a lot of new people in my chat on a

398.16 --> 402.91900000000004
regular basis now

400.44 --> 402.919
right

404.16 --> 407.41900000000004
hello Peaceful Warrior

411.0 --> 415.62
possible the lunatic is subscribing with

413.52 --> 418.34
every soccer count

415.62 --> 418.34000000000003
yes

420.599 --> 426.06
that's part of the trickery make like 50

423.96 --> 427.979
soccer counts or something as many as

426.06 --> 430.38
you can

427.979 --> 433.919
and then do things with it the thing is

430.38 --> 436.68
though if it is truly a sock account and

433.919 --> 440.0
you don't

436.68 --> 443.819
do any activities with them then YouTube

440.0 --> 446.759
does pick up on that and will eventually

443.819 --> 449.40000000000003
just delete the account

446.759 --> 451.56
as like a fake YouTube account right

449.4 --> 453.65999999999997
that comes in waves too

451.56 --> 455.639
so it's like soccer activity and then

453.66 --> 457.97900000000004
suddenly it's like this YouTube wave

455.639 --> 459.84000000000003
comes past and it's like all the socks

457.979 --> 462.96
are gone

459.84 --> 464.81899999999996
and then subscribers also go down

462.96 --> 468.44
because of that

464.819 --> 471.0
and well then it takes some time

468.44 --> 472.44
for them to start building up again they

471.0 --> 476.4
have to start over

472.44 --> 479.94
I've been seeing that happen

476.4 --> 481.5
like since I came on YouTube and every

479.94 --> 485.039
time it just

481.5 --> 486.84
it's like grass trolls and soccer counts

485.039 --> 488.94
are like grass just keeps growing and at

486.84 --> 490.79999999999995
some point the lawnmower is gonna come

488.94 --> 493.259
over it

490.8 --> 496.02000000000004
right otherwise it's like it's gonna

493.259 --> 498.36
become long grass and then ticks and

496.02 --> 500.75899999999996
other parasites start hanging around in

498.36 --> 502.91900000000004
the grass and be a nuisance

500.759 --> 504.36
the lawnmower comes over it and then

502.919 --> 507.68
it's all gone and they have to just

504.36 --> 507.68
start over from scratch

508.319 --> 516.0600000000001
I think that metaphor is very apt it's

511.08 --> 518.7189999999999
very much how that works around here

516.06 --> 518.7189999999999
huh

525.959 --> 530.3599999999999
why do is it called sock accounts

531.3 --> 537.4799999999999
because the sock is based on sock puppet

536.399 --> 539.72
right

537.48 --> 544.279
a quick

539.72 --> 544.279
representation of an individual

544.86 --> 548.88
you know a sock on your hand with two

547.019 --> 551.4590000000001
eyes and a mouth

548.88 --> 555.06
and that's like you when you look at it

551.459 --> 557.399
you can imagine that to be

555.06 --> 559.8
a creature or even a human being

557.399 --> 562.62
depending on the ACT

559.8 --> 565.0799999999999
right it's puppetry

562.62 --> 567.12
works on kids very well because they

565.08 --> 568.86
have a broad imagination so they just

567.12 --> 570.6
immediately start

568.86 --> 574.26
figuring it out

570.6 --> 577.2
the spirit of the of the puppet

574.26 --> 579.18
and yeah these soccer counts are very

577.2 --> 581.1600000000001
much like that they're just sock puppets

579.18 --> 583.56
they don't accurately represent the

581.16 --> 587.2199999999999
individual

583.56 --> 588.959
they're just there to play a little

587.22 --> 590.76
puppetry Act

588.959 --> 593.2199999999999
so that's where it came from I think

590.76 --> 596.8199999999999
sock puppets

593.22 --> 600.0
right because it's not even a well-made

596.82 --> 602.94
puppet it's not even like a very Artful

600.0 --> 605.279
human resembling puppet with clothing

602.94 --> 607.3800000000001
and careful wiring or anything like

605.279 --> 609.48
actual puppetry no a sock puppet because

607.38 --> 611.579
it's really cheap and quick

609.48 --> 614.839
right but it'll do

611.579 --> 614.8389999999999
to a certain degree

615.54 --> 618.899
right

617.1 --> 620.519
that's why it's not called a puppet

618.899 --> 623.04
account but a sock

620.519 --> 624.9590000000001
I think I don't even know this for sure

623.04 --> 628.019
but if I just raising it out like that

624.959 --> 630.18
it makes perfect sense

628.019 --> 632.279
I've never looked up the history of the

630.18 --> 634.3199999999999
word suck account

632.279 --> 637.22
maybe it's in the urban dictionary or

634.32 --> 637.22
something I don't know

637.38 --> 639.92
anyway

640.8 --> 647.04
snakes like long grass yeah sure

644.279 --> 649.26
well they like to hide in it

647.04 --> 651.66
but there's look snakes have advantages

649.26 --> 653.399
in Long Grass and disadvantages the

651.66 --> 656.519
advantage is

653.399 --> 659.16
like rodents and [ __ ] just stumble upon

656.519 --> 663.24
you and you can just get a quick snack

659.16 --> 665.2199999999999
the downside is big animals may

663.24 --> 666.9590000000001
accidentally like step on you because

665.22 --> 670.1
they didn't see you there

666.959 --> 670.0999999999999
that's the downside

671.399 --> 673.94
all right

676.2 --> 681.9590000000001
like you Google it and it was correct

678.12 --> 685.62
cool that's awesome

681.959 --> 688.92
it makes sense so yeah you know pattern

685.62 --> 692.36
just gotta follow the pattern

688.92 --> 692.36
didn't have to look that one up

696.06 --> 699.9799999999999
with no distinct personality

703.14 --> 709.62
well not necessarily you can pour a lot

706.26 --> 711.18
of Personality into a soccer gown

709.62 --> 713.6
but it's always going to be a soccer

711.18 --> 713.5999999999999
count

715.56 --> 721.5189999999999
and Arwen search engine oil

718.62 --> 721.519
brilliant

724.88 --> 732.06
nah maybe a Wiki page with

729.0 --> 735.079
like Spirit mechanics that might be I

732.06 --> 739.3199999999999
don't know I think like I'm not doing it

735.079 --> 741.3599999999999
I used to kind of do it way back in 2006

739.32 --> 743.88
and eight

741.36 --> 746.1
with my symbolic stuff now that's when I

743.88 --> 750.899
tried to catalog

746.1 --> 753.6
my the the at the time conception of

750.899 --> 757.98
spirit mechanics I put down a lot of

753.6 --> 760.32
stuff that still works it's just like

757.98 --> 763.32
that like really blows my own mind

760.32 --> 767.4590000000001
because I know there was so much I

763.32 --> 768.779
didn't understand but I did trust that I

767.459 --> 771.3599999999999
would

768.779 --> 773.3389999999999
and it worked and then to just look at

771.36 --> 776.42
that afterward it's like

773.339 --> 776.4200000000001
that's incredible

776.88 --> 780.74
how did I know to adapt

781.079 --> 787.019
to something that I

783.779 --> 791.459
didn't know but knew I would eventually

787.019 --> 794.399
know ah yeah sounds a little cryptic but

791.459 --> 797.399
but yeah a Wiki page with Spirit

794.399 --> 800.7
mechanics why not you know

797.399 --> 803.54
humans Angels demons

800.7 --> 803.5400000000001
devils

804.42 --> 809.279
the

805.98 --> 810.54
Dark World virtual representation to the

809.279 --> 812.579
spirit

810.54 --> 817.04
uh

812.579 --> 817.04
the Creator's role with information

817.26 --> 824.399
and the the distinct difference domain

821.12 --> 826.5
differences between the dream realm

824.399 --> 829.92
which is also

826.5 --> 831.959
the dark world is represented and the

829.92 --> 834.7199999999999
actual physical world like all these the

831.959 --> 837.18
spirit mechanics dude it can be mapped I

834.72 --> 839.339
am actively mapping it in my mind I'm

837.18 --> 841.3199999999999
just not writing it down

839.339 --> 844.0400000000001
at the moment I'm writing it down

841.32 --> 844.0400000000001
through my words

849.18 --> 853.9399999999999
right

850.44 --> 853.94
gonna try to upload

856.199 --> 860.3599999999999
Adam's thumbnail hold on

872.16 --> 878.18
no what's this did I all right hmm

908.58 --> 911.24
[Music]

909.24 --> 911.24
um

926.639 --> 930.66
should I do that hmm

945.12 --> 948.259
that should work

968.339 --> 970.94
hmm

973.639 --> 979.6800000000001
lawnmower shred guys inspector how is

977.22 --> 982.5600000000001
that funny that's just terrible

979.68 --> 984.5999999999999
and by the way snakes are very vibration

982.56 --> 986.779
sensitive if there's like a lawnmower

984.6 --> 989.399
engine going in

986.779 --> 992.579
the snake's wolf they're not just gonna

989.399 --> 994.92
sit there and be mowed over

992.579 --> 998.54
they're not stupid

994.92 --> 998.54
like they will Slither away

1007.399 --> 1013.16
I mean if it's really fast they might

1010.399 --> 1014.48
not react in time so like if for example

1013.16 --> 1016.279
out of nowhere

1014.48 --> 1017.779
a truck

1016.279 --> 1021.199
came just

1017.779 --> 1023.36
crashing and like speeding right through

1021.199 --> 1025.1599999999999
a field like that yeah then they might

1023.36 --> 1028.76
just realize it too late and get

1025.16 --> 1033.5790000000002
squished right but a lawnmower doesn't

1028.76 --> 1033.579
go like 80 miles an hour or something

1038.299 --> 1043.4189999999999
crazy

1040.699 --> 1043.419
uh

1054.559 --> 1060.559
Neo who's Neo which Neo is that return

1058.7 --> 1063.94
to normal

1060.559 --> 1063.94
hey Richie

1064.7 --> 1068.32
it's been a while good to see you

1092.299 --> 1096.62
right yeah you block them I don't blame

1094.82 --> 1100.46
you Richie

1096.62 --> 1103.3999999999999
like as yeah it's it's almost like

1100.46 --> 1105.74
especially to women these Gammas are

1103.4 --> 1108.6200000000001
just so nasty

1105.74 --> 1111.6200000000001
it it's been a problem from the start

1108.62 --> 1114.62
like Patricia to

1111.62 --> 1117.02
like the more feminine you are in your

1114.62 --> 1118.6
looks or in your voice the more they

1117.02 --> 1121.76
want to just

1118.6 --> 1124.2199999999998
claw away at you

1121.76 --> 1127.36
it's terrible so I totally get that you

1124.22 --> 1127.3600000000001
just choose to block them

1135.02 --> 1137.44
laughs

1138.26 --> 1143.179
right the only real reason not to do

1140.96 --> 1146.72
that is if you kind of have a purpose

1143.179 --> 1148.94
for them if you have a mission to do

1146.72 --> 1152.1200000000001
that requires

1148.94 --> 1154.419
interaction requires him you to see them

1152.12 --> 1154.4189999999999
right

1154.88 --> 1159.38
if I hadn't

1156.919 --> 1162.6200000000001
then I I would have also just like

1159.38 --> 1164.5390000000002
instantly blocked all everyone and I

1162.62 --> 1165.799
would never mention anything about

1164.539 --> 1168.74
trolls

1165.799 --> 1172.6399999999999
I wouldn't even swear at them

1168.74 --> 1174.679
I probably shouldn't at all even now

1172.64 --> 1177.14
that I do interact with them

1174.679 --> 1180.64
but yeah it's just like hey I might I

1177.14 --> 1180.64
got my heart on my tongue

1187.039 --> 1191.26
Branson is grounded what

1195.2 --> 1201.64
oh [ __ ] oh dude I didn't even know he

1198.44 --> 1201.64
was gonna do a new flight

1202.34 --> 1208.82
the guy did inspector I had no idea

1205.88 --> 1211.8200000000002
like yeah you know

1208.82 --> 1215.539
when they when like there's space things

1211.82 --> 1219.1589999999999
or launches it gets a lot of attention

1215.539 --> 1219.1589999999999
and that's how I pick up on it

1226.159 --> 1230.48
right there's an event then it gets a

1228.86 --> 1232.9399999999998
lot of media attention then I definitely

1230.48 --> 1235.58
pick up on it but I'm not somebody

1232.94 --> 1237.44
that's like really interested in oh

1235.58 --> 1239.9189999999999
what's he gonna do next what he's gonna

1237.44 --> 1239.919
do next

1241.94 --> 1245.1200000000001
right

1243.2 --> 1247.659
so I don't keep track of what they're

1245.12 --> 1247.6589999999999
actually doing

1247.94 --> 1251.8400000000001
but I do keep tabs so thanks for that

1250.28 --> 1255.22
information

1251.84 --> 1255.22
is grounded

1255.5 --> 1261.08
specs

1257.419 --> 1263.539
were not up to par by U.S standards

1261.08 --> 1265.9399999999998
apparently

1263.539 --> 1268.1
I don't see how though because I don't

1265.94 --> 1271.3400000000001
know I saw that

1268.1 --> 1273.5
that Virgin Galactic thing

1271.34 --> 1275.9599999999998
and it seemed everything seemed like

1273.5 --> 1280.72
pretty damn smooth

1275.96 --> 1280.72
no visual abnormalities at least

1291.98 --> 1295.659
hey hello Shelton

1297.38 --> 1302.179
why is it when you search or when you

1299.78 --> 1304.76
get a lot of hate videos well that's

1302.179 --> 1307.76
because I have a lot of fans

1304.76 --> 1310.179
and these fans like really want

1307.76 --> 1310.179
attention

1313.4 --> 1317.0590000000002
right

1314.84 --> 1319.72
and there's really nothing I can do

1317.059 --> 1319.72
about it anymore

1322.88 --> 1327.6200000000001
I I kind of just at some point chose to

1325.46 --> 1330.46
like okay let's just let them do

1327.62 --> 1330.4599999999998
whatever they do

1331.94 --> 1336.26
if I'm gonna try to stop them it's just

1334.039 --> 1340.1
gonna have a strides in the back

1336.26 --> 1343.039
but despite that they've still just like

1340.1 --> 1346.6999999999998
burrowed and burrowed but seriously like

1343.039 --> 1348.32
the level of mockery and this date in

1346.7 --> 1351.0800000000002
some of these videos are so

1348.32 --> 1353.6589999999999
mind-boggling it's like wow people don't

1351.08 --> 1355.1
even get that nasty with politicians

1353.659 --> 1358.88
that they hate

1355.1 --> 1360.26
it's like pretty bizarre but

1358.88 --> 1362.6000000000001
right

1360.26 --> 1366.559
if you really want to find me you you'll

1362.6 --> 1368.6
just have to find the YouTube account

1366.559 --> 1372.039
then you have to gonna scroll through

1368.6 --> 1372.039
all the all the fans first

1376.76 --> 1380.36
didn't their mothers teach them about

1378.44 --> 1382.1000000000001
negative attention well I bet they

1380.36 --> 1386.08
didn't

1382.1 --> 1386.08
or they even used it on them

1386.96 --> 1390.52
right bad mothers

1396.02 --> 1399.1589999999999
but yeah good point

1408.98 --> 1413.659
but I think it's also just a response

1411.559 --> 1417.3999999999999
you know it's a visceral inside

1413.659 --> 1420.98
spiritual response to what I do

1417.4 --> 1423.799
and in a way the shamelessness

1420.98 --> 1427.94
and confidence that I do show in what I

1423.799 --> 1429.32
do it's like I am unrelenting in my

1427.94 --> 1433.5800000000002
mission

1429.32 --> 1438.02
The Awakening the truth Spirit mechanics

1433.58 --> 1440.84
to really like put another dimension to

1438.02 --> 1442.8799999999999
the entire experience literally another

1440.84 --> 1447.1999999999998
depth to it all

1442.88 --> 1450.8600000000001
and try to integrate it the entire

1447.2 --> 1454.22
Insight the entire grip to the just

1450.86 --> 1457.9399999999998
literally all the world

1454.22 --> 1458.96
I'm I'm actively trying to ascend the

1457.94 --> 1462.74
world

1458.96 --> 1464.059
and it's very intuitive because if

1462.74 --> 1465.6200000000001
you're just gonna reason about it

1464.059 --> 1468.6789999999999
logically

1465.62 --> 1470.8999999999999
then there's just no grip it's just too

1468.679 --> 1473.9
much like the freaking world man and

1470.9 --> 1475.279
every individual but

1473.9 --> 1477.5
if you just

1475.279 --> 1479.419
take a step back and just look at

1477.5 --> 1480.679
standard mechanics and statistical

1479.419 --> 1482.2990000000002
effects

1480.679 --> 1484.94
and

1482.299 --> 1486.3799999999999
then I cross-reference that foresight

1484.94 --> 1489.98
for myself

1486.38 --> 1491.779
with just how I see other people talk

1489.98 --> 1494.3600000000001
about things

1491.779 --> 1496.52
on their streams and that is all

1494.36 --> 1499.279
directions like even like separated

1496.52 --> 1502.6399999999999
interviews or like a doctor

1499.279 --> 1504.08
coming out with a video against these or

1502.64 --> 1505.5200000000002
something right

1504.08 --> 1508.039
like

1505.52 --> 1510.62
there's so much detailed information

1508.039 --> 1513.679
about where they are at

1510.62 --> 1515.9189999999999
with their Insight that it it's almost

1513.679 --> 1518.0
like

1515.919 --> 1520.94
watering plants

1518.0 --> 1523.46
and just testing like okay I'm gonna put

1520.94 --> 1525.38
down something really heavy

1523.46 --> 1528.26
and I don't even plan it it just happens

1525.38 --> 1532.22
and then I recognize it and then I look

1528.26 --> 1535.299
how much is that level echoing are other

1532.22 --> 1535.299
people also

1535.58 --> 1542.12
getting something growing

1539.72 --> 1545.6000000000001
it's very intuitive process almost like

1542.12 --> 1548.86
growing plants it's bizarre

1545.6 --> 1548.86
to really think about it

1555.5 --> 1560.559
I am a scumbag on the internet oh wow

1561.38 --> 1566.779
why

1563.299 --> 1570.52
Percy what did I do to you

1566.779 --> 1570.52
person that I've never met before

1591.799 --> 1596.9
well a Shelton yeah they need to say

1594.74 --> 1598.64
things like that because they need they

1596.9 --> 1600.8600000000001
needed off their chest they're just

1598.64 --> 1603.26
really frustrated

1600.86 --> 1605.0
right but they don't understand that

1603.26 --> 1608.48
they're basically just

1605.0 --> 1611.059
whacking off in public

1608.48 --> 1614.059
it's really embarrassing but they need

1611.059 --> 1615.9189999999999
to do it right you can't stop a crazy

1614.059 --> 1617.8999999999999
guy that's

1615.919 --> 1620.2990000000002
in a crazy mood

1617.9 --> 1621.98
can't stop it that you just gotta let

1620.299 --> 1623.9
them do [ __ ] because if you try to stop

1621.98 --> 1625.58
them they could even like get aggressive

1623.9 --> 1626.96
and dangerous because they're out of

1625.58 --> 1628.76
their minds in such a month they just

1626.96 --> 1631.52
need to express whatever is inside of

1628.76 --> 1633.76
them right so

1631.52 --> 1637.96
yeah you just gotta let him squirt

1633.76 --> 1637.96
there's nothing I could do about it

1643.34 --> 1648.08
right and I know that at everything I

1646.399 --> 1650.899
say everything

1648.08 --> 1653.0
they mirror and I see it right away it's

1650.899 --> 1655.36
really bizarre realization like there is

1653.0 --> 1658.159
an inside World Inside Out World

1655.36 --> 1660.76
analysis train of thinking

1658.159 --> 1663.7990000000002
an inside out spirit that basically

1660.76 --> 1666.32
follows what I do around with everything

1663.799 --> 1669.7
I say because a lot of the principles

1666.32 --> 1673.6399999999999
that I do share they work universally

1669.7 --> 1676.1000000000001
but that means they are also

1673.64 --> 1679.039
you you can

1676.1 --> 1681.4399999999998
it is an option to turn them inside out

1679.039 --> 1683.779
if you are like that if you like doing

1681.44 --> 1688.059
that if you're stuck into doing that

1683.779 --> 1688.059
have that realization also

1693.38 --> 1699.74
and they you know every time I speak

1696.98 --> 1701.84
and they feel like I'm touching them

1699.74 --> 1704.299
something that's very personal and

1701.84 --> 1705.86
private and comes with a lot of Shame

1704.299 --> 1706.6399999999999
and feelings they don't like to deal

1705.86 --> 1710.0
with

1706.64 --> 1712.22
then they just immediately instantly

1710.0 --> 1714.14
they know it doesn't even get to their

1712.22 --> 1716.059
conscious thought they just immediately

1714.14 --> 1718.5200000000002
projected onto me

1716.059 --> 1721.22
and it's very easy to do that when

1718.52 --> 1723.08
somebody is telling a story about shame

1721.22 --> 1725.539
and

1723.08 --> 1729.3799999999999
and just

1725.539 --> 1731.299
confliction pain and trying to endure it

1729.38 --> 1734.659
and how to what happens to you when

1731.299 --> 1738.86
you're deflected it's so incredibly easy

1734.659 --> 1740.96
to completely for your mind not for your

1738.86 --> 1744.08
heart so much but for your mind isolate

1740.96 --> 1746.1200000000001
yourself in that story not get involved

1744.08 --> 1750.98
stay the third person

1746.12 --> 1755.4799999999998
it uh perceiver of it the spectator and

1750.98 --> 1757.94
then just see that mechanic on to me the

1755.48 --> 1761.24
one that's explaining it

1757.94 --> 1764.24
so to them then it becomes a story about

1761.24 --> 1766.64
myself that I'm telling

1764.24 --> 1769.159
and the funny thing is

1766.64 --> 1771.2
there's something to that

1769.159 --> 1774.5590000000002
but not right now

1771.2 --> 1777.14
you see in the past I've I've went

1774.559 --> 1779.24
through all these weird

1777.14 --> 1781.7
Roots a shame

1779.24 --> 1783.559
bad mistakes and holding on to the

1781.7 --> 1786.44
mistake even becoming the mistake and

1783.559 --> 1790.279
then later having to realize it and

1786.44 --> 1792.02
letting it go anyway and it had being a

1790.279 --> 1797.14
lot more painful

1792.02 --> 1797.1399999999999
because I doubled down on it for so long

1797.179 --> 1803.0590000000002
so I know all these processes and I

1800.12 --> 1806.6589999999999
almost think sometimes that I actively

1803.059 --> 1808.8799999999999
made many mistakes just so I could grow

1806.659 --> 1812.2990000000002
out of them and learn about it

1808.88 --> 1814.179
and then help others and have more

1812.299 --> 1816.62
trouble

1814.179 --> 1817.94
overcoming these up personal obstacles

1816.62 --> 1822.02
in their lives

1817.94 --> 1823.88
inside themselves not external internal

1822.02 --> 1826.279
dealing with feelings dealing with

1823.88 --> 1829.5800000000002
Sensations dealing with what it is to be

1826.279 --> 1834.279
a human being and the challenges

1829.58 --> 1834.279
that sometimes are very overwhelming

1835.88 --> 1843.3200000000002
to master that because that is Ascension

1840.58 --> 1845.62
overcoming the obstacle that is the way

1843.32 --> 1845.62
through

1848.419 --> 1850.96
all right

1852.279 --> 1857.799
paradigms never shift without resistance

1854.899 --> 1857.799
that's right

1867.019 --> 1872.179
oh Percy Turnbull never shared with us

1870.38 --> 1875.2600000000002
why

1872.179 --> 1875.26
oh shame

1879.08 --> 1884.96
I'm really curious to to hear him out on

1882.26 --> 1887.679
why I'm supposedly a scumbag on the

1884.96 --> 1887.679
internet like

1887.899 --> 1893.6589999999999
that is a word you know this has some

1890.6 --> 1895.9399999999998
implications esoteric implications and I

1893.659 --> 1899.14
I just really

1895.94 --> 1899.14
want to see

1899.539 --> 1903.1
how that could fit

1904.039 --> 1910.039
how what's the percentage of white noise

1906.74 --> 1912.08
you would have to have in order to see

1910.039 --> 1915.62
that

1912.08 --> 1917.899
in what I do so I'm very curious but he

1915.62 --> 1920.1789999999999
just threw out the singular at home I

1917.899 --> 1922.84
guess and then ran away again

1920.179 --> 1922.8400000000001
ah

1932.419 --> 1935.96
oh by the way

1934.279 --> 1941.5
almost forgot

1935.96 --> 1941.5
I got an Illuminati casan bonus whoo

1945.22 --> 1948.329
[Music]

1957.5 --> 1960.159
all right

1964.94 --> 1967.539
hmm

1980.48 --> 1986.059
ah yeah I appreciate that PJ cruisek but

1984.2 --> 1990.38
to be fair though

1986.059 --> 1992.48
I'm not perfect you know when I'm when

1990.38 --> 1994.94
my voice

1992.48 --> 1998.299
is being recorded

1994.94 --> 2001.059
I pay extra attention to do things right

1998.299 --> 2002.019
but hey sometimes in chat I can get kind

2001.059 --> 2005.019
of wild

2002.019 --> 2008.2
I can get pretty

2005.019 --> 2011.6200000000001
well yeah almost demonic

2008.2 --> 2015.64
but it's really just like an Inquisitor

2011.62 --> 2019.1399999999999
Spirit that's like I'm gonna I am

2015.64 --> 2019.14
gonna get ya

2020.86 --> 2028.1399999999999
and that can get pretty intimidating I

2023.98 --> 2028.14
can be pretty intimidating and gruesome

2028.36 --> 2035.5
and I'm not proud of that

2031.36 --> 2036.8799999999999
like afterwards I always just feel dirty

2035.5 --> 2038.919
and yeah

2036.88 --> 2042.8200000000002
you know when you do that to some of

2038.919 --> 2044.919
these people then they that moment that

2042.82 --> 2046.779
Essence that frequency which is not a

2044.919 --> 2049.06
good frequency it is not very Christian

2046.779 --> 2050.44
like the the troll guy yesterday said

2049.06 --> 2055.72
right

2050.44 --> 2059.5
it is true it isn't and I was not

2055.72 --> 2062.98
hesitant to immediately admit that

2059.5 --> 2065.379
right because the recognition of what is

2062.98 --> 2067.119
right and wrong

2065.379 --> 2072.22
is

2067.119 --> 2074.32
overall more important than even what

2072.22 --> 2076.54
if you repeat it

2074.32 --> 2079.44
because if you know something is right

2076.54 --> 2079.44
or wrong then

2080.02 --> 2086.02
you will like be more willing and able

2083.44 --> 2088.5
to take the burden of the consequences

2086.02 --> 2088.5
of it

2118.9 --> 2121.56
right

2125.68 --> 2131.0789999999997
thanks PG crucial I really appreciate

2128.02 --> 2133.619
that but in the past though I have kind

2131.079 --> 2137.6400000000003
of been but it's more like

2133.619 --> 2137.6400000000003
scumbaggery through negligence

2138.46 --> 2145.599
like the worst things I've ever done

2142.54 --> 2147.96
was knowing what was going on and doing

2145.599 --> 2147.96
nothing

2152.44 --> 2159.82
but yeah that sounds really weird maybe

2156.88 --> 2161.6800000000003
but it's not just that it's like I would

2159.82 --> 2164.02
also enjoy

2161.68 --> 2166.8999999999996
like defying

2164.02 --> 2168.16
like it gave me a feeling like yeah I

2166.9 --> 2170.98
know

2168.16 --> 2173.6189999999997
how this could be fixed

2170.98 --> 2175.66
but I'm not gonna do it

2173.619 --> 2180.119
because

2175.66 --> 2180.1189999999997
of petty personal feeling reasons

2187.839 --> 2192.839
right but I haven't really done that in

2190.359 --> 2192.839
a long time

2193.18 --> 2197.859
like that only happens when I am like

2195.94 --> 2200.5
very emotional

2197.859 --> 2203.339
and then the emotion will definitely

2200.5 --> 2203.339
outshine

2203.74 --> 2208.18
the effect the sin I think so whatever

2206.8 --> 2210.04
anyway

2208.18 --> 2213.839
what happened to Rob's keeper I don't

2210.04 --> 2213.839
know Amanda young what happened to him

2216.28 --> 2222.2400000000002
oh my God he is good in the ICU all

2220.119 --> 2222.2400000000002
right

2223.599 --> 2227.579
I hope he didn't take any V's

2230.92 --> 2237.0
thank you

2232.359 --> 2240.54
no covet isn't fantasy it's a condition

2237.0 --> 2240.54
now I said it

2242.5 --> 2247.48
right

2243.82 --> 2250.1400000000003
let's just get him some eye stat

2247.48 --> 2250.14
quickly

2280.3 --> 2284.98
what

2282.88 --> 2287.2000000000003
a Shelton

2284.98 --> 2290.28
Fred Klaus who is that

2287.2 --> 2290.2799999999997
what are you talking about

2317.02 --> 2319.74
oh okay

2327.94 --> 2335.2000000000003
right a just a piece of advice on

2332.38 --> 2337.7200000000003
writing that sort of thing in chat

2335.2 --> 2340.18
if you're when I do that when I would

2337.72 --> 2343.0789999999997
Give an example like that I would put it

2340.18 --> 2343.0789999999997
in between

2343.24 --> 2352.54
what I freaking call that this the two

2347.02 --> 2355.24
dots is it brackets no quotation marks

2352.54 --> 2357.7599999999998
because it is like a sentence like a

2355.24 --> 2362.16
quote almost I don't know

2357.76 --> 2362.1600000000003
never mind it's it's just cosmetics

2368.44 --> 2374.2200000000003
uh

2369.7 --> 2374.22
dark cosmetic more semantics really

2381.099 --> 2386.4
dude but how the [ __ ] in the ICU

2386.92 --> 2390.48
so what ICU

2400.66 --> 2405.04
right

2402.88 --> 2407.02
you got to be kind of careful with these

2405.04 --> 2410.98
conditions and getting admitted in

2407.02 --> 2413.619
hospitals because they might just like

2410.98 --> 2414.94
try to get

2413.619 --> 2417.1600000000003
see

2414.94 --> 2418.42
budget money out of him if you know what

2417.16 --> 2422.2599999999998
I mean

2418.42 --> 2423.2200000000003
I hope yeah I hope he's being taken care

2422.26 --> 2426.0
of

2423.22 --> 2426.0
properly

2431.02 --> 2435.3
all right well thanks for the info Mike

2433.0 --> 2435.3
Hunt

2464.92 --> 2471.0
speech parenthesis

2467.8 --> 2471.0
thank you rob h

2471.52 --> 2474.72
speech marks

2485.2 --> 2491.0989999999997
yeah parenthesis would be a good word

2487.359 --> 2491.0989999999997
it's just not a word that I've

2491.68 --> 2496.98
got steadily integrated in my vocabulary

2500.2 --> 2503.04
thank you for that

2508.66 --> 2515.64
a new EMF what

2512.22 --> 2515.64
electromagnetic frequency

2518.5 --> 2525.099
well yeah

2521.26 --> 2527.7400000000002
it's going to have an influence overall

2525.099 --> 2531.599
but yeah if you look at it from a German

2527.74 --> 2531.5989999999997
new medicine perspective

2531.94 --> 2536.16
like disease conditions like that are

2535.3 --> 2539.38
always

2536.16 --> 2542.3799999999997
responses their responses to like

2539.38 --> 2542.38
tensions

2544.06 --> 2552.94
right so an example would be somebody

2548.44 --> 2555.28
is as a working life very heavy working

2552.94 --> 2557.14
life with a lot of stress or a lot of

2555.28 --> 2558.6400000000003
responsibility they they're doing great

2557.14 --> 2561.16
they get plenty of money but they're

2558.64 --> 2563.14
like always busy with that [ __ ]

2561.16 --> 2565.1189999999997
they never get sick

2563.14 --> 2568.18
then sadly

2565.119 --> 2570.94
it's vacation

2568.18 --> 2573.16
and at first they'll be like hey but I

2570.94 --> 2575.92
don't really want to stop working

2573.16 --> 2577.7799999999997
because then when they stop working

2575.92 --> 2579.2200000000003
they go on vacation whatever maybe

2577.78 --> 2583.1400000000003
they're going somewhere maybe they don't

2579.22 --> 2583.14
even go anywhere they get sick

2584.38 --> 2590.4
right and that's not because they were

2586.359 --> 2590.4
infected that's because

2590.76 --> 2597.2200000000003
it's transformation time

2594.52 --> 2600.04
like the spirit has been like very

2597.22 --> 2601.5989999999997
active very long and then suddenly it

2600.04 --> 2604.72
lets go

2601.599 --> 2606.52
and then all this stuff that couldn't be

2604.72 --> 2610.1189999999997
cleaned up

2606.52 --> 2613.359
because of the setting

2610.119 --> 2616.359
are suddenly like okay now now he

2613.359 --> 2619.359
finally went away quickly clean this up

2616.359 --> 2622.119
right and then you get sick this used to

2619.359 --> 2626.2799999999997
happen to my mother every single time

2622.119 --> 2626.28
there was a vacation every single time

2631.48 --> 2638.02
right hey remember the 2019 Amsterdam

2636.339 --> 2640.66
conference

2638.02 --> 2643.359
remember how incredibly stressful that

2640.66 --> 2645.22
even was like before it happened I was

2643.359 --> 2647.38
totally stressing out over it and the

2645.22 --> 2649.839
guys were like suddenly like oh yeah go

2647.38 --> 2652.48
on a freaking week tour with people I've

2649.839 --> 2654.2799999999997
never met face to face before

2652.48 --> 2657.7
like when I haven't even really been

2654.28 --> 2660.3390000000004
outside of my own City at all for years

2657.7 --> 2662.9199999999996
it was like super stressful and I

2660.339 --> 2665.319
already said like I'm gonna get sick

2662.92 --> 2668.2200000000003
I guarantee it and guess what happened

2665.319 --> 2671.14
after the conference was pretty amazing

2668.22 --> 2673.7799999999997
it really was cool

2671.14 --> 2676.2999999999997
and then afterward

2673.78 --> 2680.1600000000003
guess what happened I got sick and I got

2676.3 --> 2680.1600000000003
pretty sick from it like I got

2680.319 --> 2686.44
pneumonia

2682.18 --> 2690.339
type [ __ ] not super hat not like

2686.44 --> 2692.8
scary but heavy because

2690.339 --> 2694.599
it's like a psychosomatic trigger it's a

2692.8 --> 2697.599
response to

2694.599 --> 2700.54
suddenly being exposed to a lot of

2697.599 --> 2704.02
people face to face that are that deal

2700.54 --> 2707.079
in similar subject similar subjects

2704.02 --> 2708.4
and like a Brotherhood

2707.079 --> 2711.46
family

2708.4 --> 2714.579
Sensation that I have never really felt

2711.46 --> 2718.18
before right it was all very testing

2714.579 --> 2720.6400000000003
and then yeah afterward I got sick

2718.18 --> 2724.44
because my body had to process that all

2720.64 --> 2724.44
too after it was over

2724.54 --> 2730.48
so if Rob skiba went to like another

2727.72 --> 2732.22
conference and a tour and thing very

2730.48 --> 2735.52
busy very

2732.22 --> 2737.6189999999997
strenuous in a good way too usually

2735.52 --> 2739.3
otherwise you wouldn't keep on doing it

2737.619 --> 2740.2000000000003
but yeah especially I haven't done it in

2739.3 --> 2743.7400000000002
a while

2740.2 --> 2747.4199999999996
and you do it again yeah you get sick

2743.74 --> 2750.22
after it is over or if you're unlucky

2747.42 --> 2754.1800000000003
in the middle of it like when you're

2750.22 --> 2755.859
really piled too much weight on and you

2754.18 --> 2758.74
can't handle it and then you break even

2755.859 --> 2761.2
during the process that happens too I

2758.74 --> 2763.06
don't know how it went but this is fully

2761.2 --> 2767.2
logical to me and has nothing to do

2763.06 --> 2767.2
whatsoever with infections

2767.26 --> 2774.2400000000002
some foreign entity invading you

2771.04 --> 2774.24
absolutely nothing

2781.119 --> 2783.839
uh

2799.18 --> 2803.2
news with Mark Sergeant no no now that

2801.64 --> 2805.6189999999997
you mentioned I haven't heard from him

2803.2 --> 2805.6189999999997
in a while

2806.14 --> 2809.16
I don't know

2812.44 --> 2818.04
I don't know what he's doing maybe he's

2814.3 --> 2818.04
like taking care of family and [ __ ]

2823.119 --> 2827.98
you know you you gotta especially like

2826.0 --> 2832.119
look out for your elders in this time

2827.98 --> 2835.66
because if you don't they might just get

2832.119 --> 2837.6400000000003
dragged in a uh a killer trap

2835.66 --> 2840.24
in the medical system if you know what I

2837.64 --> 2840.24
mean so

2844.54 --> 2850.92
I don't know if that is what is going on

2846.64 --> 2850.92
but wouldn't surprise me if it was

2869.44 --> 2873.7200000000003
should give ski with some cannabis oil

2874.059 --> 2878.1400000000003
yeah

2876.04 --> 2880.7799999999997
I don't know if he'd take it Dutch

2878.14 --> 2884.2
sailor but

2880.78 --> 2886.78
I think that if they just give him I

2884.2 --> 2888.04
I'm not even gonna spell it out starts

2886.78 --> 2889.78
with an i

2888.04 --> 2892.24
give him that

2889.78 --> 2894.3390000000004
that would do great

2892.24 --> 2896.7
especially if you're the if if you get

2894.339 --> 2896.7
it early

2901.42 --> 2903.9
right

2904.78 --> 2908.52
the mid Mr Ed medicine

2908.619 --> 2913.9
as they as they like to paraded around

2912.04 --> 2915.16
in a mockery now

2913.9 --> 2918.579
right

2915.16 --> 2922.2599999999998
does this bring him some Mr Ed medicine

2918.579 --> 2922.26
and that should work great

2939.88 --> 2942.059
foreign

2954.4 --> 2959.38
a horse is a horse of course of course

2956.8 --> 2962.02
dude it's American

2959.38 --> 2966.6600000000003
it's a horse

2962.02 --> 2966.66
Mr Ed medicine Jesus come on

2967.66 --> 2973.24
I I can't say it

2971.02 --> 2975.9
I can't say it out loud I'm not gonna do

2973.24 --> 2975.8999999999996
that on my show

3005.76 --> 3009.26
what are you talking about

3011.46 --> 3014.119
no

3018.3 --> 3021.7400000000002
I know what you're trying but

3022.02 --> 3027.78
oh my God

3024.599 --> 3029.579
dude Dutch sailor what

3027.78 --> 3031.559
what world have you been living in

3029.579 --> 3034.4
when's the last time you watched any

3031.559 --> 3034.4
sort of media

3040.98 --> 3047.48
starts with an i

3043.14 --> 3047.48
was invented in Japan

3047.819 --> 3054.48
works really well for certain conditions

3051.119 --> 3056.6400000000003
as in instantly and not just that it

3054.48 --> 3059.88
works for all kinds of things and it is

3056.64 --> 3063.96
currently being mocked in the media as

3059.88 --> 3066.7200000000003
horse medicine right I'm not gonna say

3063.96 --> 3068.88
it if you can't figure it out from those

3066.72 --> 3070.74
hints then you got a problem

3068.88 --> 3073.38
don't know what world you've been living

3070.74 --> 3076.16
in but if you don't get that I'm not

3073.38 --> 3076.1600000000003
gonna help you anymore

3081.18 --> 3084.9199999999996

[Music]

3105.3 --> 3112.319
dude if

3108.72 --> 3115.4399999999996
you could literally what I just said

3112.319 --> 3117.599
put that together like in a Google

3115.44 --> 3121.38
Search and it would probably give you

3117.599 --> 3121.38
the right result serious

3156.54 --> 3161.599
yeah

3158.04 --> 3161.599
I wonder if that will work

3169.319 --> 3176.7599999999998
holy [ __ ] that worked dude just Google

3172.8 --> 3176.76
horse dewormer

3178.44 --> 3181.52
gotta do it

3186.72 --> 3189.5
that's enough

3189.66 --> 3191.839
foreign

3198.619 --> 3204.839
right right yeah yeah I made all that

3201.599 --> 3207.0
effort to not say it out loud so you

3204.839 --> 3210.92
could say it out loud guessing it in my

3207.0 --> 3210.92
chat thanks Bad Karma thanks a lot

3219.059 --> 3223.559
of skip I got the vaccine made oof I

3222.24 --> 3225.4799999999996
don't know if he did

3223.559 --> 3229.7400000000002
I did

3225.48 --> 3232.52
that that would seem really silly to me

3229.74 --> 3232.52
I don't know

3266.52 --> 3272.7599999999998
right yeah but Dutch sailor the horse

3268.92 --> 3276.0
the wormer that's one application

3272.76 --> 3277.7400000000002
that's that's one and the media is using

3276.0 --> 3280.799
it

3277.74 --> 3284.299
to try and give a flare of ridicule

3280.799 --> 3286.559
right because it is so unbelievably

3284.299 --> 3288.839
unbelievably effective

3286.559 --> 3291.599
it's not just for that

3288.839 --> 3296.46
works against parasites

3291.599 --> 3299.6400000000003
and well virus related

3296.46 --> 3301.559
conditions it's very funny even like the

3299.64 --> 3304.5589999999997
conditions right it works against the

3301.559 --> 3307.5
condition oh what have I been saying the

3304.559 --> 3309.6600000000003
V is yeah it isn't anything it's it's a

3307.5 --> 3312.48
condition it is not an infectious agent

3309.66 --> 3315.48
right so yeah

3312.48 --> 3318.54
horse dewormer

3315.48 --> 3322.92
that substance

3318.54 --> 3325.98
invented in Japan works for all kinds of

3322.92 --> 3328.7400000000002
things it's like a really great

3325.98 --> 3331.619
medical invention that works for all

3328.74 --> 3334.8799999999997
kinds of different things

3331.619 --> 3334.88
it's a real blessing

3344.599 --> 3349.1600000000003
yeah I'm not a I'm no doctor

3354.48 --> 3358.339
I didn't get the right paper

3362.7 --> 3366.96
but I'm very interested in medical

3364.74 --> 3370.2799999999997
developments though

3366.96 --> 3370.28
and understanding

3380.579 --> 3385.579
all right Mike Hunt yeah sure

3384.299 --> 3389.64
well

3385.579 --> 3391.319
HIV to me I don't really even see it as

3389.64 --> 3393.54
anything

3391.319 --> 3396.24
right

3393.54 --> 3397.38
as Owen Benjamin has been saying for a

3396.24 --> 3401.52
long time

3397.38 --> 3405.0
and I I based on very long term

3401.52 --> 3406.68
personal study like even like private in

3405.0 --> 3409.319
my own mind not sharing it with people

3406.68 --> 3410.7599999999998
study considerations

3409.319 --> 3412.5
because I always thought it was very

3410.76 --> 3414.7200000000003
scary

3412.5 --> 3416.94
I've been very scared about like being

3414.72 --> 3418.319
infected and [ __ ] like especially in my

3416.94 --> 3420.559
teens I I didn't know I didn't

3418.319 --> 3420.5589999999997
understand

3421.559 --> 3425.52
but apparently yeah nobody even died of

3424.799 --> 3428.88
that

3425.52 --> 3432.54
it was always freaking

3428.88 --> 3435.78
I don't remember what it is uh

3432.54 --> 3438.359
but yeah it came from fauci fauci

3435.78 --> 3439.799
actually gave

3438.359 --> 3443.64
people

3439.799 --> 3447.599
cures supposedly assistance

3443.64 --> 3449.46
for the AIDS condition and that is most

3447.599 --> 3451.319
likely the thing that ended up killing

3449.46 --> 3453.859
them

3451.319 --> 3456.079
for real statistically

3453.859 --> 3459.38
allegedly right

3456.079 --> 3459.38
they don't know

3459.599 --> 3465.8590000000004
but that

3462.059 --> 3465.8590000000004
little detail has been going around

3466.92 --> 3473.76
so yeah I guys I really don't think that

3470.52 --> 3476.94
viruses as portrayed in a medical system

3473.76 --> 3478.7990000000004
are a legitimate scientific model I

3476.94 --> 3481.38
don't think it is

3478.799 --> 3482.7599999999998
I think it is a mistake in the

3481.38 --> 3485.2200000000003
interpretation

3482.76 --> 3487.44
of what is actually going on and then

3485.22 --> 3490.98
yeah I'm not saying that the processes

3487.44 --> 3492.9
that they perceive and test and analyze

3490.98 --> 3494.7
that that doesn't happen all right okay

3492.9 --> 3497.52
those things are probably happen it's

3494.7 --> 3499.4399999999996
just the context of it all you know

3497.52 --> 3501.98
I think they got the context wrong

3499.44 --> 3506.94
because I think it's

3501.98 --> 3509.099
bodily processes it's part of our Metabo

3506.94 --> 3512.819
metabolic system

3509.099 --> 3515.88
household housekeeping cleaning up and

3512.819 --> 3519.119
then virus what they presume are viruses

3515.88 --> 3521.54
are basically acting agents within that

3519.119 --> 3521.54
process

3524.04 --> 3529.2799999999997
and then there are little weird Oddities

3526.5 --> 3529.28
with it too

3529.619 --> 3535.619
but

3531.9 --> 3538.88
it's just not the model that they

3535.619 --> 3538.88
they portray it as

3540.42 --> 3545.839
I don't know the Sailor I I don't want

3542.7 --> 3545.839
to get into that too much

3549.48 --> 3554.119
I'm not even sure like what that is

3559.559 --> 3564.8590000000004
I know what they say it is I I just

3562.26 --> 3564.8590000000004
don't believe it

3568.26 --> 3573.8390000000004
right but hey if it's already said

3571.98 --> 3576.72
that

3573.839 --> 3578.7
horse dewormer actually works against

3576.72 --> 3581.2799999999997
that

3578.7 --> 3583.5589999999997
and it's like official that means that

3581.28 --> 3585.5400000000004
it's backed by study testing right that

3583.559 --> 3587.88
is so it doesn't really matter anymore

3585.54 --> 3590.819
what HIV is then

3587.88 --> 3593.76
like the model doesn't matter anymore

3590.819 --> 3595.619
because if it just provably works

3593.76 --> 3598.3190000000004
against it then what does it even matter

3595.619 --> 3600.6600000000003
what it was or how it came in into being

3598.319 --> 3603.0589999999997
or whatever what it's even doing

3600.66 --> 3604.02
if it can complete completely clear it

3603.059 --> 3607.2000000000003
out

3604.02 --> 3610.7599999999998
through the horse dewormer

3607.2 --> 3610.7599999999998
well problem solved

3622.2 --> 3624.3799999999997
foreign

3632.579 --> 3637.3390000000004
why would you think anybody would say

3634.98 --> 3637.339
that

3648.54 --> 3651.2599999999998
no

3652.2 --> 3655.9399999999996
no I'm not saying that at all

3661.44 --> 3670.319
the HIV is probably a

3666.059 --> 3673.079
a break a problem in that process

3670.319 --> 3675.48
in the mechanism right

3673.079 --> 3680.78
what I'm simply saying is it's like a

3675.48 --> 3680.78
virus is not like a an entity

3681.599 --> 3685.319
it's just a building block and hey

3683.7 --> 3687.0
things could be wrong with building

3685.319 --> 3690.54
blocks you know

3687.0 --> 3692.099
especially if you screw around

3690.54 --> 3694.92
with them

3692.099 --> 3697.099
on the like epigenetic level and all

3694.92 --> 3697.099
that

3711.24 --> 3713.7799999999997
all right

3729.559 --> 3736.079
all right

3731.88 --> 3738.42
so yeah so who cares what it is

3736.079 --> 3741.78
how you're supposed to perceive it if

3738.42 --> 3744.42
horse dewormer officially

3741.78 --> 3746.8190000000004
solved it then what does it even matter

3744.42 --> 3749.2200000000003
anymore what does it matter anymore

3746.819 --> 3751.88
whether it is just

3749.22 --> 3756.0
a mistaken

3751.88 --> 3758.819
correlatory thing to be thought of as in

3756.0 --> 3760.26
as a self-sufficient unit that does

3758.819 --> 3763.2
something

3760.26 --> 3765.2990000000004
or whether it is like a distorted

3763.2 --> 3768.0
condition of the body

3765.299 --> 3771.18
what does it matter anymore if horse

3768.0 --> 3774.9
dewormer just solves it right it doesn't

3771.18 --> 3774.8999999999996
matter anymore hmm

3792.359 --> 3794.9
foreign

3805.14 --> 3809.0
because sympathetically yeah

3809.7 --> 3815.24
sympathetic reaction is a legitimate

3812.819 --> 3815.24
thing

3816.059 --> 3820.76
resonance

3818.24 --> 3823.14
psychosomatically triggered or

3820.76 --> 3827.4
sympathetic resonance

3823.14 --> 3829.74
like being in the field energy field

3827.4 --> 3831.42
of somebody else that is going through

3829.74 --> 3834.1189999999997
the process

3831.42 --> 3836.52
it's like

3834.119 --> 3838.619
being around another piece of

3836.52 --> 3841.98
information

3838.619 --> 3843.599
and then you kind of copy it

3841.98 --> 3845.94
through sympathy

3843.599 --> 3848.339
you don't even have to know about it but

3845.94 --> 3850.02
just by being in the presence of

3848.339 --> 3853.2
somebody that is going through a

3850.02 --> 3856.2
specific process while all that process

3853.2 --> 3858.48
every process is registered in the field

3856.2 --> 3860.5389999999998
in their personal field in their

3858.48 --> 3864.599
personal energy

3860.539 --> 3867.6600000000003
and if you are very sympathetic towards

3864.599 --> 3871.38
the individual then it's not unlikely

3867.66 --> 3875.7
that your field information will try to

3871.38 --> 3878.1800000000003
adapt to it and the condition

3875.7 --> 3878.18
right

3884.88 --> 3891.2400000000002
what psychosomatic mannequin saying what

3887.7 --> 3894.3799999999997
are you talking about Gideon sick

3891.24 --> 3894.3799999999997
that makes no sense

3900.48 --> 3902.66
foreign

3905.76 --> 3912.0
now the thing is

3908.4 --> 3913.92
there is no transmission there is no

3912.0 --> 3917.099
particulate

3913.92 --> 3921.38
transmission you understand Aries cursor

3917.099 --> 3926.46
man no particulate transmission

3921.38 --> 3928.859
no particulate transmission not relevant

3926.46 --> 3932.039
only energy

3928.859 --> 3935.7599999999998
a particle will simply

3932.039 --> 3938.1600000000003
be created inside the body because that

3935.76 --> 3941.2200000000003
is where it is always created

3938.16 --> 3945.24
that's where it is where every related

3941.22 --> 3949.02
trace of it is stored because it's an

3945.24 --> 3951.72
integral part of the body's metabolism

3949.02 --> 3954.619
it's all in there

3951.72 --> 3954.6189999999997
all of it

3981.48 --> 3985.7400000000002
all right I get it yeah Prodigy yeah

3984.0 --> 3988.28
I've listened to some Prodigy man I

3985.74 --> 3991.319
listened to prodigy

3988.28 --> 3995.099
since I was 11 pretty much up until I

3991.319 --> 3997.2
was 15 a lot of it like really non-stop

3995.099 --> 3999.599
listening to all of it

3997.2 --> 4002.859
and

3999.599 --> 4002.8590000000004
drawing [ __ ]

4004.039 --> 4008.6600000000003
a lot of drawing

4006.079 --> 4012.26
and also I was distinctly remember

4008.66 --> 4016.22
building a very very elaborate

4012.26 --> 4018.2000000000003
Quake 2 level on that [ __ ] I I had a

4016.22 --> 4021.339
period when I like to do that like 3D

4018.2 --> 4021.339
modeling levels

4024.68 --> 4030.5589999999997
but mostly just drawing computer games

4028.339 --> 4033.799
yeah I always wanted to make computer

4030.559 --> 4034.88
games like really obsessively when I was

4033.799 --> 4037.66
young

4034.88 --> 4037.6600000000003
like anything

4040.819 --> 4045.2
I still have the book works I've showed

4043.22 --> 4047.72
some of them

4045.2 --> 4050.8999999999996
like I dude before it all kind of went

4047.72 --> 4053.839
to [ __ ] I basically tried to design like

4050.9 --> 4056.1800000000003
a Mario World 3.

4053.839 --> 4059.0
that was an integration of the Mario

4056.18 --> 4062.359
World mechanics with the Mario Brothers

4059.0 --> 4064.579
2 mechanics to basically make it like a

4062.359 --> 4065.96
just an amazing

4064.579 --> 4068.6600000000003
thing

4065.96 --> 4071.599
with like fractal implications of every

4068.66 --> 4074.7799999999997
freaking function to make it like really

4071.599 --> 4078.92
a great puzzle but completely based in

4074.78 --> 4081.1400000000003
the original two Blooms of of mechanisms

4078.92 --> 4083.599
from the Mario Brothers 2 which was not

4081.14 --> 4087.02
really utilized after that and the Mario

4083.599 --> 4087.98
Brothers 3 which had just enormous I

4087.02 --> 4090.74
mean

4087.98 --> 4093.22
Mario World which had enormous potential

4090.74 --> 4093.22
overall

4094.039 --> 4101.319
right anyway

4096.859 --> 4101.319
yeah that's what I used to do as a kid

4103.88 --> 4110.0
in retrospect I really can't think of a

4106.699 --> 4113.0199999999995
more nerdy way to spend my youth

4110.0 --> 4113.02
but that's what I did

4116.179 --> 4118.299
um

4136.58 --> 4140.259
what do you mean about condoms

4152.06 --> 4156.319
what look my [ __ ] it all depends you

4154.52 --> 4158.359
know

4156.319 --> 4161.96
it depends on where you're gonna stick

4158.359 --> 4165.1
it where you're gonna stick yours

4161.96 --> 4165.1
if you know what I mean

4168.14 --> 4173.12
but yeah condoms will still prevent the

4170.839 --> 4174.799
pregnancy right and that's always kind

4173.12 --> 4177.5199999999995
of been its main

4174.799 --> 4177.5199999999995
thing

4187.58 --> 4195.0199999999995
right but in my personal experience

4191.719 --> 4198.46
which is limited by the way compared to

4195.02 --> 4198.46
probably some other people out there

4198.56 --> 4201.64
a lot of like

4202.28 --> 4209.0599999999995
like bad sex and thank God I haven't had

4206.659 --> 4211.699
that bad much of it

4209.06 --> 4213.679
but if it's like really just things are

4211.699 --> 4216.678999999999
wrong the energy is not good

4213.679 --> 4219.1990000000005
then that can have all kinds of pretty

4216.679 --> 4222.159
heavy impact on your health

4219.199 --> 4222.159
on the short run

4222.38 --> 4227.14
like bad sex is really unhealthy for you

4232.159 --> 4234.639999999999
right

4235.34 --> 4239.2390000000005
and especially if you just do it

4237.5 --> 4242.06
constantly

4239.239 --> 4243.44
then it's literally gonna wear and tear

4242.06 --> 4245.42
on your body and then it's not

4243.44 --> 4248.54
surprising you're gonna develop like all

4245.42 --> 4251.4800000000005
kinds of weird conditions

4248.54 --> 4253.76
because you are effectively breaking

4251.48 --> 4255.94
your body through the energy of your

4253.76 --> 4255.9400000000005
spirit

4267.02 --> 4270.400000000001
the birds think it's funny

4271.52 --> 4277.0
maybe

4272.98 --> 4277.0
yeah it's a jackdaws

4277.28 --> 4281.0199999999995
better than dirty talk what

4283.88 --> 4287.0
why

4285.38 --> 4291.08
this is just

4287.0 --> 4294.04
I'm trying to be plastic about it

4291.08 --> 4294.04
don't squirt

4295.28 --> 4299.259999999999
it's just

4296.719 --> 4299.26
you know

4314.179 --> 4322.4
dude Bad Karma I so disagree with you

4319.82 --> 4326.5
no way man no

4322.4 --> 4326.5
no you know what the best freaking

4329.38 --> 4335.3
Prodigy albums was the freaking first

4332.659 --> 4337.639999999999
one man dude have you you've probably

4335.3 --> 4341.4400000000005
never actually listened to that

4337.64 --> 4341.4400000000005
because it was kind of overlooked

4367.219 --> 4374.06
I mean fat of the land is pretty decent

4370.82 --> 4377.48
it's pretty cool

4374.06 --> 4381.64
but seriously

4377.48 --> 4381.639999999999
the experience is something else

4381.679 --> 4388.219
like this is a music that is just

4385.219 --> 4388.219
incategorizable

4388.52 --> 4394.159000000001
it's something else

4391.699 --> 4396.82
and hey the jail the generation was

4394.159 --> 4396.82
pretty good too

4396.92 --> 4402.679
but yeah the first one the experience is

4399.739 --> 4405.08
just it's something else it's something

4402.679 --> 4409.96
that you forget

4405.08 --> 4409.96
because it's so its own frequency

4423.62 --> 4427.599999999999
yeah I still have them CDs

4443.62 --> 4450.92
Juju Superior yeah until it gets wiped

4447.28 --> 4453.679
huh Aries till it gets wiped

4450.92 --> 4456.8
so that disc crashes until

4453.679 --> 4458.54
you get some feedback and suddenly

4456.8 --> 4461.179
your

4458.54 --> 4463.219
uh your Electric System of your computer

4461.179 --> 4465.14
can't handle it and then suddenly like

4463.219 --> 4468.08
things get really fried and then it's

4465.14 --> 4470.4800000000005
lost and then you don't even remember

4468.08 --> 4471.679
what you lost

4470.48 --> 4473.599999999999
yeah

4471.679 --> 4476.719
no no

4473.6 --> 4478.9400000000005
electric is not Superior

4476.719 --> 4481.699
it's easier

4478.94 --> 4484.759999999999
it's not Superior because

4481.699 --> 4487.239
and it's gone and your memory with it

4484.76 --> 4487.2390000000005
right

4542.0 --> 4544.06
um

4545.36 --> 4549.5
Frank Ashley what

4550.58 --> 4555.64
is that like you mean like the singer

4553.159 --> 4555.639999999999
project

4574.88 --> 4577.88
no

4578.0 --> 4580.659
dude

4595.1 --> 4598.719
oh very [ __ ] funny

4611.12 --> 4614.92
it's really a dick move dude

4644.48 --> 4650.799999999999
yeah you tried to Rick Roll us with that

4647.12 --> 4650.8
he's definitely not dead

4651.28 --> 4654.94
very freaking funny

4702.02 --> 4704.02
um

4704.42 --> 4709.659
I'm gonna go into the older music even

4717.44 --> 4720.98
that

4719.06 --> 4725.2390000000005
dude when it comes to that

4720.98 --> 4727.759999999999
that sort of music from that age 80s I

4725.239 --> 4730.759999999999
was just listening to the police

4727.76 --> 4732.92
and Kate Bush that were those were

4730.76 --> 4736.42
absolutely my favorites

4732.92 --> 4736.42
a bit of Bryan Adams too

4739.28 --> 4746.679
oh and Rupert Hein

4742.179 --> 4746.679
which absolutely nobody knows

4770.3 --> 4777.4400000000005
any Dutch bands I like

4774.08 --> 4780.1
dude I don't even know Dutch mats

4777.44 --> 4780.099999999999
no

4784.88 --> 4790.88
I mean I don't hate Dutch music although

4788.78 --> 4793.84
I

4790.88 --> 4793.84
it's just

4794.84 --> 4799.96
I

4796.64 --> 4799.96
I don't know what to say

4829.04 --> 4836.48
I was talking about one the other day oh

4833.36 --> 4839.62
a Dutch band really

4836.48 --> 4839.62
which one was that

4846.08 --> 4852.139
I mean there there are like

4849.739 --> 4854.239
solo artists

4852.139 --> 4856.76
from the 70s

4854.239 --> 4859.58
they were like singing in a guitar right

4856.76 --> 4862.639
that was pretty famous and that's like

4859.58 --> 4865.82
pretty decent it's just before my time I

4862.639 --> 4868.639
knew I had a couple of friends back

4865.82 --> 4870.98
I can make late teens friends at school

4868.639 --> 4874.58
that were really into that

4870.98 --> 4877.218999999999
but other than that I I don't know

4874.58 --> 4879.98
I don't know any Dutch

4877.219 --> 4882.679
music artist that I've been like wow

4879.98 --> 4885.4
that is so awesome no

4882.679 --> 4885.4
I'm sorry

4890.3 --> 4894.56
and sometimes it's just like okay these

4892.699 --> 4896.719
artists they have been doing their own

4894.56 --> 4898.46
style for quite a while and then they

4896.719 --> 4901.04
get pretty decent at it and they they're

4898.46 --> 4904.4800000000005
not even halfway bad people it's just

4901.04 --> 4904.48
it's not really my kind of music

4912.739 --> 4918.4
oh God

4914.38 --> 4918.400000000001
you're not uh

4925.88 --> 4928.54
dude

4935.06 --> 4937.780000000001
I mean

4937.88 --> 4943.76
yeah but that's 90 [ __ ] and I was a teen

4940.94 --> 4947.0
like there was like I get I did kind of

4943.76 --> 4949.9400000000005
like like too unlimited and another band

4947.0 --> 4951.739
it was kind of similar I still have the

4949.94 --> 4953.839999999999
CD somewhere

4951.739 --> 4959.12
but

4953.84 --> 4962.2390000000005
those were Dutch like like uh

4959.12 --> 4965.42
damn it I forgot the name

4962.239 --> 4967.04
like a singer of the other band that I

4965.42 --> 4969.32
can't freaking remember and I'm really

4967.04 --> 4971.3
embarrassed now like I even like knew

4969.32 --> 4974.0
her in person because she was a student

4971.3 --> 4976.28
of my mother's

4974.0 --> 4978.44
right

4976.28 --> 4981.08
well that was kind of like the new

4978.44 --> 4983.719
Breaking house scene in the early 90s

4981.08 --> 4986.6
and it got all popular and [ __ ]

4983.719 --> 4989.44
and I kind of liked it back then

4986.6 --> 4989.4400000000005
sorta

4997.159 --> 5004.5
but yeah that's me as a teen so

5000.699 --> 5004.5
yeah yeah that'll remind me thanks

5006.76 --> 5010.92
it it was another R win

5011.44 --> 5015.719
oh look at me sweating all embarrassed

5016.54 --> 5019.8
there's no r

5022.78 --> 5029.44
no no no no no no no no no no no no no

5025.78 --> 5032.5
no no no no no no no no there's no

5029.44 --> 5035.879999999999
radius no no

5032.5 --> 5035.88
oh thank you for that

5041.739 --> 5046.5599999999995
I needed that thanks

5044.32 --> 5046.5599999999995
foreign

5079.98 --> 5088.78
s look pop music was always garbage

5085.54 --> 5089.98
it's very rare that a pop music song

5088.78 --> 5092.679
actually

5089.98 --> 5097.86
get through

5092.679 --> 5097.86
and then still works after a long time

5097.96 --> 5105.04
and the 80s had a lot of like like

5100.78 --> 5107.199
really just stupid garbage music really

5105.04 --> 5109.56
bad it's like they were doing it on

5107.199 --> 5109.5599999999995
purpose

5117.88 --> 5122.9800000000005
yeah

5119.26 --> 5125.1990000000005
and they dude they probably did that

5122.98 --> 5128.259999999999
before that time too and they've done it

5125.199 --> 5131.5599999999995
ever since the 90s were definitely pop

5128.26 --> 5135.58
music it's just like how bad can we make

5131.56 --> 5139.42
[ __ ] how stupid and lame and

5135.58 --> 5140.86
what do you call it again like uh

5139.42 --> 5143.92
vulgar

5140.86 --> 5146.44
can we get [ __ ] just

5143.92 --> 5149.86
as bad as as possible

5146.44 --> 5151.54
and just Ram it up and it seems to get

5149.86 --> 5153.639
worse and worse and worse and now in

5151.54 --> 5157.78
this age it's even like

5153.639 --> 5159.76
just almost blatantly satanic as [ __ ]

5157.78 --> 5161.8
right

5159.76 --> 5165.04
because there's just always pushing it

5161.8 --> 5168.34
worse and worse that's pop music

5165.04 --> 5171.94
it's stupid and it's

5168.34 --> 5175.96
it's not just for the stupid it is

5171.94 --> 5179.219
for the stupid to make them more stupid

5175.96 --> 5179.219
more corrupted

5231.699 --> 5238.96
yep John Bernard that is how Jazz works

5235.96 --> 5242.199
dude sometimes like they when there's

5238.96 --> 5243.94
like jazz being played on the radio it

5242.199 --> 5247.12
sometimes happens like even in this in

5243.94 --> 5250.239
the organic Supermarket I gotta go at

5247.12 --> 5253.12
right and then just play a little jazz

5250.239 --> 5255.759999999999
and I will just literally play another

5253.12 --> 5260.199
party with my voice on that because I

5255.76 --> 5263.8
can because I get it and it's so easy

5260.199 --> 5266.379999999999
just like just pick up instrument voice

5263.8 --> 5268.7390000000005
and just start playing and you can make

5266.38 --> 5268.7390000000005
it work

5279.52 --> 5284.56
I learned that one from my mother

5282.58 --> 5287.739
just gotta get in the frequency you

5284.56 --> 5290.1990000000005
gotta get what is going on and just

5287.739 --> 5292.62
start start building

5290.199 --> 5292.62
anyway

5324.639 --> 5329.6990000000005
I'm looking well okay thank you

5330.52 --> 5334.3
that's

5332.199 --> 5337.62
whatever

5334.3 --> 5337.62
I'm doing pretty well

5348.219 --> 5350.76
hmm

5384.04 --> 5389.5199999999995
hey banjo bear

5385.96 --> 5389.52
getting in key right

5412.9 --> 5415.62

5416.82 --> 5420.659

5423.04 --> 5427.54

5425.159 --> 5430.78
good morning

5427.54 --> 5436.0199999999995
or just good morning Larry

5430.78 --> 5436.0199999999995
Laurie I'm sorry good morning Laurie

5447.0 --> 5450.42
loves my voice

5452.8 --> 5457.360000000001
huh

5454.78 --> 5459.4
dude I listened back to my own voice and

5457.36 --> 5462.04
I really don't love my voice all that

5459.4 --> 5465.659
much but that maybe it's because I'm

5462.04 --> 5465.659
just so used to hearing it

5473.56 --> 5478.84
although there is this weird thing

5476.26 --> 5481.6
when I'm on my own show my voice isn't

5478.84 --> 5483.76
really all that bad but sometimes when I

5481.6 --> 5485.08
get on the flatter debates it's almost

5483.76 --> 5489.46
like

5485.08 --> 5492.179
I go double speed and then my voice gets

5489.46 --> 5492.179
kind of annoying

5492.88 --> 5496.1990000000005
it's weird like that

5501.94 --> 5505.98
I gotta be careful with that

5515.26 --> 5517.9800000000005
what

5519.04 --> 5525.48
cold finger was touched what the hell

5522.34 --> 5525.4800000000005
are you talking about

5564.88 --> 5569.4400000000005
okay Godzilla

5567.159 --> 5572.0199999999995
I didn't know that

5569.44 --> 5574.178999999999
I know that the Netherlands was

5572.02 --> 5578.4400000000005
originally

5574.179 --> 5582.2390000000005
sort of a province of the German Empire

5578.44 --> 5582.239
before it like separated

5597.639 --> 5602.38
I didn't know that

5599.44 --> 5604.839999999999
that was like mixed in

5602.38 --> 5608.86
in interpretation

5604.84 --> 5611.46
when they went over to America

5608.86 --> 5611.46
hmm

5615.4 --> 5620.879999999999
yeah I don't know John Burnett I don't

5617.44 --> 5620.879999999999
know what peaceful war is on about

5635.5 --> 5639.34
we don't call ourselves Dutch no we

5638.139 --> 5642.34
don't

5639.34 --> 5646.12
because that's English

5642.34 --> 5650.08
Dutch is an English word

5646.12 --> 5653.88
we just call ourselves nederlands

5650.08 --> 5653.88
or Hollands

5672.1 --> 5676.620000000001
yeah I just said that that's seven

5685.6 --> 5688.56
foreign

5704.32 --> 5712.0
it's actually a whole longer kind of

5706.84 --> 5714.52
means lowlander is like Hollow lands

5712.0 --> 5717.6
close to the ground Highlander is

5714.52 --> 5717.6
exactly the opposite

5731.56 --> 5735.4800000000005
okay Dutch sailor that's fine

5758.92 --> 5762.54
I gotta reheat this thing

5783.1 --> 5791.02
all right PG Curry Shank

5785.56 --> 5791.02
wait so you never say Scottish

5794.56 --> 5800.02
that's like unusual thing to say like

5796.96 --> 5802.78
I'm Scottish it would be I'm a Scot

5800.02 --> 5805.5
or a Scotsman

5802.78 --> 5805.5
I don't know

5834.159 --> 5840.94
whiskeyish now that's just called drunk

oh right

5947.8 --> 5953.56

5949.92 --> 5956.02
I mean it's been very amusing in this

5953.56 --> 5959.159000000001
chat but now I'm kind of like I don't

5956.02 --> 5959.159000000001
really know what to talk about

5959.679 --> 5965.619
just watching you guys chat away

5962.679 --> 5968.04
being a little silly and it is very fun

5965.619 --> 5968.04
but

5970.92 --> 5976.7390000000005
yeah maybe I'm just done

5973.719 --> 5976.7390000000005
