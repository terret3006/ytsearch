2.29 --> 9.019
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

5.959 --> 12.5
early-bird number 42 I'm your host

9.019 --> 16.94
Arwen and today is the same weather

12.5 --> 23.39
yesterday pretty much yeah it's 42

16.94 --> 28.07
episode so I guess I might talk about

23.39 --> 32.75
the meaning of everything anyway I do

28.07 --> 36.2
that anyway almost every show so I see

32.75 --> 39.980000000000004
Dan Winfield in chat ajm plain and

36.2 --> 47.290000000000006
simple Cleary Flat Earth searching for

39.98 --> 54.14
gnosis page David read Joseph 3 6 9 TM

47.29 --> 61.46
welcome guys so yeah open for guests you

54.14 --> 62.78
know how to get in man yeah if the after

61.46 --> 67.399
the show I have to do a lot of

62.78 --> 69.549
preparation for my next engines and

67.399 --> 73.789
dragon sessions tomorrow

69.549 --> 77.509
so yeah despite everything I'm kind of

73.789 --> 79.459
behind work tends to happen a lot forget

77.509 --> 82.13
one element leave it laying around and

79.459 --> 84.259
then it's like oh damn one more day so

82.13 --> 86.58999999999999
yeah I have to write the story continue

84.259 --> 86.59
the story

89.139 --> 93.189
other than that yeah

97.99 --> 103.47
what's going on yeah

108.21 --> 113.42999999999999
yeah I've been having a

109.7 --> 115.23
behind-the-scenes some real support from

113.43 --> 120.84
people and I appreciate that

115.23 --> 123.42
and I've also considered and this is

120.84 --> 126.68
actually Randy's idea and it's a good

123.42 --> 131.58
idea to basically put out my paypal

126.68 --> 133.68
address as yeah an option to donate

131.58 --> 136.11
I guess just like the rest of the guys

133.68 --> 140.37
are doing I do have a PayPal account but

136.11 --> 144.72000000000003
I want to change my email address for

140.37 --> 148.47
that so yeah I think I'm probably gonna

144.72 --> 152.09
put that in the description box that's

148.47 --> 160.4
gonna be just a way to yeah help me

152.09 --> 161.69
progress my show and give me options

160.4 --> 165.54
eventually

161.69 --> 169.91
so until yeah I get to those thousand

165.54 --> 174.989
subscribers which is one hell of a task

169.91 --> 176.54999999999998
like even Nathan yesterday shouted me

174.989 --> 179.37
out and encourage people to subscribe

176.55 --> 184.489
and they did and it's really weird

179.37 --> 190.68
because twice my subscribers went above

184.489 --> 194.25
802 803 and twice that they returned

190.68 --> 194.94
back to where they were and where they

194.25 --> 200.25
are now

194.94 --> 207.06
that's 195 or at 795 it's really odd

200.25 --> 209.07
it's like YouTube chips seems to be

207.06 --> 216.69
keeping my subscribers on a tight leash

209.07 --> 220.17
so yeah if you want to help me out their

216.69 --> 222.81
only real way to do is is to spread the

220.17 --> 226.70899999999997
show share the show and get real

222.81 --> 228.62
youtubers we're genuinely interested to

226.709 --> 231.33
pick up on my channel and subscribe

228.62 --> 234.269
that's the only way I'm gonna get to

231.33 --> 239.76000000000002
those thousand subscribers and activate

234.269 --> 242.43
the whole thing well and also helping

239.76 --> 246.14999999999998
with that will be real OBS

242.43 --> 250.20000000000002
set up like more professional-looking

246.15 --> 253.17000000000002
hang out with a good intro and yeah so

250.2 --> 255.629
many guys have been offering to help me

253.17 --> 258.419
out on this and I will take take on

255.629 --> 261.239
their offers just have to prepare a bit

258.419 --> 264.21
myself must be psychologically to get

261.239 --> 268.67999999999995
creative and I will start doing that

264.21 --> 273.63
absolutely after after the DND

268.68 --> 276.15000000000003
session is done so after tomorrow then

273.63 --> 282.40999999999997
I'll have plenty of time to focus purely

276.15 --> 286.56
on yeah building up the format of this

282.41 --> 288.96000000000004
and that will be cool like if I can

286.56 --> 293.61
really master OBS then I can just put

288.96 --> 296.54999999999995
out the link in the chat without any

293.61 --> 301.35
direct dangers so that will be

296.55 --> 305.28000000000003
interesting maybe have I could

301.35 --> 308.72900000000004
potentially have debates with ballers

305.28 --> 315.0
even if they choose to with using my

308.729 --> 318.15
rules I guess somewhere in the direction

315.0 --> 321.479
of what Tim was doing the Hangout the

318.15 --> 325.28
debates I know of which I was part but

321.479 --> 325.28
yeah not a slow and

330.18 --> 335.13
I will just see what happens I think it

332.759 --> 338.03000000000003
could be cool letting on the guests I've

335.13 --> 345.229
already been having moderate success

338.03 --> 350.52
having P Mars on and L&B on and yeah

345.229 --> 354.419
that seems to work out fine so I might

350.52 --> 356.669
try is something riskier well yeah until

354.419 --> 365.18
I got the OBS setup it's just gonna be

356.669 --> 365.18
this hey Anamika

369.46 --> 386.81
when a wall 101 rockhound the red path

375.92 --> 393.86
Enders ace Thorson built and pop the red

386.81 --> 402.07
path michael roark yeah good to see you

393.86 --> 402.07
guys so what is the meaning of the goal

402.94 --> 409.37
yeah it's not so easy to figure that out

405.35 --> 416.24
and our consciousness makes it even

409.37 --> 418.19
harder especially when also the ego is

416.24 --> 420.77
still a part of that and no it's always

418.19 --> 422.51
going to be some part of it but the more

420.77 --> 424.09999999999997
it becomes a part of the harder it

422.51 --> 428.0
becomes to actually figure it out

424.1 --> 431.39000000000004
because as an individual consciousness

428.0 --> 434.95
bound by these energy restrictions I

431.39 --> 442.4
guess or prisons energy restrictions

434.95 --> 447.56
bodily functions all that that we our

442.4 --> 451.88
conscious tends to limit what we can

447.56 --> 455.0
grasp and what we can accept so the

451.88 --> 459.32
meaning of it all is really hard because

455.0 --> 462.98
yeah humans the mind the consciousness

459.32 --> 466.64
objectifies and the meaning of it all is

462.98 --> 468.56
not gonna be subjective really well then

466.64 --> 472.43
it's going to be the meaning of it all

468.56 --> 474.38
for you and yeah that can be completely

472.43 --> 476.45
different with everyone and everybody

474.38 --> 480.92
has a meaning of it all that they

476.45 --> 482.57
basically dig for and latch on to look

480.92 --> 484.84000000000003
which could be part of religion which

482.57 --> 487.88
could be part of a set of principles

484.84 --> 490.03999999999996
yeah but that's the meaning of it all

487.88 --> 494.77
from a subjective perspective so what is

490.04 --> 494.77000000000004
it from an objective perspective well

495.83 --> 507.10999999999996
the patterns the patterns the nature of

500.0 --> 510.409
things what is the meaning of that home

507.11 --> 519.7090000000001
well it seems to be if you describe it

510.409 --> 524.66
transformation and the transition from

519.709 --> 526.9399999999999
chaos to order and then breaking apart

524.66 --> 529.3389999999999
again into chaos and which is very

526.94 --> 533.72
similar to the process of

529.339 --> 537.1700000000001
crystallization by the way think about

533.72 --> 540.9200000000001
that crystal like you have to go to

537.17 --> 544.76
rites molecular substance for a certain

540.92 --> 546.9499999999999
type of crystal to form you put it yeah

544.76 --> 550.13
you have it dissolved in water or some

546.95 --> 552.1700000000001
substance that that works with and you

550.13 --> 553.91
let it settle and it's gonna form

552.17 --> 556.52
crystals and these crystals aren't gonna

553.91 --> 558.5889999999999
grow and they're gonna grow bigger and

556.52 --> 561.1
more complex and there's gonna be side

558.589 --> 564.1300000000001
steps and everything it's like a tree

561.1 --> 569.839
yeah essentially it's gonna run out and

564.13 --> 572.24
then well either sits there for a very

569.839 --> 576.7700000000001
long time or it's gonna be broken apart

572.24 --> 579.32
and used for something else and well

576.77 --> 583.959
that feels very similar to these cycles

579.32 --> 595.9300000000001
of of human civilization for example and

583.959 --> 599.66
I guess of animal culture even because

595.93 --> 604.8389999999999
there is saying that there is like this

599.66 --> 604.8389999999999
perfect mate balance in nature where

605.23 --> 610.52
predator-prey everything keeps each

607.61 --> 614.9300000000001
other in balance well I've been thinking

610.52 --> 619.06
about that maybe that is a myth as well

614.93 --> 623.029
maybe nature doesn't really do that but

619.06 --> 625.2199999999999
we can tend to nature to make that

623.029 --> 627.279
happen and that is desirable that

625.22 --> 629.3000000000001
everything would be in balance and

627.279 --> 633.529
populations would be stable

629.3 --> 636.89
all these animal kinds but does nature

633.529 --> 640.7
do that when unattended really does it

636.89 --> 644.6899999999999
do that or does the same thing happens

640.7 --> 649.519
as on the lot with the long run with

644.69 --> 652.9100000000001
cycles of human Empires do they come

649.519 --> 659.45
stronger bigger and then grow out of

652.91 --> 661.519
control and yeah either destroy their

659.45 --> 666.2900000000001
feeding base and then I'll starve to

661.519 --> 670.22
death or become some lead the subject of

666.29 --> 672.3499999999999
hunting because of the amount yeah

670.22 --> 680.39
become at our new target because of the

672.35 --> 684.88
size of it yeah all depends well depends

680.39 --> 687.769
if there are natural predators present a

684.88 --> 690.32
plenty to you actually counter the

687.769 --> 692.72
growth and that's not always been the

690.32 --> 696.399
case like in Australia yeah you could

692.72 --> 702.9100000000001
say but we're people that brought

696.399 --> 702.91
rabbits and all that right but

705.82 --> 712.72
I don't know species migrate with the

709.15 --> 716.1999999999999
help of other species all the time you

712.72 --> 722.49
know like marine life travels on the

716.2 --> 722.49
turtle back and migrates that way and

726.96 --> 731.89
species use other species to get to

729.97 --> 735.5400000000001
places that they themselves could not

731.89 --> 739.78
get all the time I'm just saying

735.54 --> 745.1999999999999
so to blame exclusively man for such a

739.78 --> 748.66
thing I don't know maybe if just a giant

745.2 --> 751.75
let's say there was a huge mudslide

748.66 --> 755.38
somewhere and a giant forest was

751.75 --> 757.54
basically just threw yeah bashed

755.38 --> 761.59
down by the mudslide and all these trees

757.54 --> 766.12
are all floating near the sea now well

761.59 --> 768.94
many animals yeah maybe in chaos many

766.12 --> 772.36
would have died but let's say that some

768.94 --> 774.6400000000001
of these smaller animals just happen to

772.36 --> 777.37
get caught on these trees and then

774.64 --> 779.83
started floating and if they got lucky

777.37 --> 783.91
and the weather is not too terrible and

779.83 --> 787.0600000000001
the drift goes in a very concurrent

783.91 --> 788.4399999999999
quick direction they might actually end

787.06 --> 792.18
up in an island where they could never

788.44 --> 797.1300000000001
reach swimming there by accident and

792.18 --> 801.03
yeah I don't see that as extremely

797.13 --> 806.02
unlikely you know I could imagine it

801.03 --> 808.5699999999999
without too much weird stuff all natural

806.02 --> 813.4
occurring phenomena that could happen

808.57 --> 815.49
yeah that could happen so I think these

813.4 --> 818.02
kind of things new species getting

815.49 --> 819.94
accidentally or newly introduced in new

818.02 --> 825.84
environments that's not adapted to it

819.94 --> 825.84
happens by itself in nature all the time

828.97 --> 836.0
so yeah and by the way that has nothing

833.12 --> 839.45
to do with evolution not really I'm not

836.0 --> 842.09
suggesting that this is just the natural

839.45 --> 846.38
balance between the creatures and the

842.09 --> 848.36
predatory cycle basically so I'm not

846.38 --> 851.03
suggesting that this has anything

848.36 --> 855.47
directly to do with species evolution at

851.03 --> 858.89
all although yeah these things may

855.47 --> 861.8000000000001
influence the micro evolutions between

858.89 --> 871.27
the species border and make a species

861.8 --> 875.51
more predatory or more more plant eating

871.27 --> 878.72
so yeah I do think that evolution

875.51 --> 881.06
happens within a species over short

878.72 --> 885.14
periods of time so they can relatively

881.06 --> 887.0
adapt to new life circumstances but now

885.14 --> 898.0
new species into other species that

887.0 --> 899.59
doesn't really happen don't god yeah

898.0 --> 910.67
yeah

899.59 --> 913.22
yeah Jim Jim and vegan boy that guy has

910.67 --> 918.1999999999999
a rage boner for me or something every

913.22 --> 924.89
time I come up he just gets into this

918.2 --> 932.59
fits yeah it's a safe to say I'm I'm not

924.89 --> 938.13
a Marxist not a communist so

932.59 --> 949.96
No very much libertarian foundationally

938.13 --> 956.02
limited government yeah but what is the

949.96 --> 970.59
meaning of law meaning is that things

956.02 --> 970.59
are cyclical that life is resilient that

974.57 --> 983.49
when life becomes cornered extraordinary

978.39 --> 985.17
abilities will manifest dormant

983.49 --> 993.66
potentially dormant abilities that's

985.17 --> 996.15
another thing and yeah and then there's

993.66 --> 1001.36
the what's the meaning of it all to a

996.15 --> 1004.73
person well the meaning of it all is to

1001.36 --> 1014.96
find a path for yourself with meaning

1004.73 --> 1021.94
and try to be sensible flexible but

1014.96 --> 1021.94
still true to principles it's just

1027.819 --> 1033.279
ya know but this is just personal

1029.319 --> 1037.72
conduct now but but yeah I see the

1033.279 --> 1040.389
meaning of it always just manifest your

1037.72 --> 1043.539
potential and to work with it and to

1040.389 --> 1047.74
find the social then you have the social

1043.539 --> 1050.83
meaning yeah we have needs to be

1047.74 --> 1057.429
fulfilled socially find a purpose and a

1050.83 --> 1062.309
place among other people and be merry

1057.429 --> 1066.5700000000002
with one another let's be happy and

1062.309 --> 1066.57
let's help each other out

1067.529 --> 1072.879
where we can of course you can't always

1070.33 --> 1074.6789999999999
help everybody and somebody needs to be

1072.879 --> 1081.6689999999999
wanted to be helped in order to be

1074.679 --> 1083.5590000000002
helped but yeah a lot of people they

1081.669 --> 1085.8700000000001
just need to see that there is somebody

1083.559 --> 1089.759
out there actually offering and they

1085.87 --> 1092.0189999999998
will take it even though they're not

1089.759 --> 1094.679
asking in their own flesh now they're

1092.019 --> 1094.679
going to get me

1105.39 --> 1112.38
very loud inside

1109.11 --> 1112.3799999999999
[Music]

1114.94 --> 1122.5900000000001
if I had to run and I'd have to run down

1117.96 --> 1125.1290000000001
three flights of stairs so it's not

1122.59 --> 1125.129
gonna work out

1132.22 --> 1141.22
okay and there's this you misspelled

1137.6 --> 1141.2199999999998
there I've no idea what you're saying

1158.61 --> 1165.85
right

1159.85 --> 1167.59
have children lots of them well thing

1165.85 --> 1169.9599999999998
about that I would have to be able to

1167.59 --> 1172.269
handle them and it's been quite at your

1169.96 --> 1176.559
handling myself so I'm not too sure if

1172.269 --> 1184.5
I'd want to so many of those but to be

1176.559 --> 1184.5
fair I do do have children it's there

1188.54 --> 1194.6599999999999
it's not an overwhelming sensation but

1191.78 --> 1205.46
it is there in the background but I want

1194.66 --> 1210.71
to be with the right woman it has to be

1205.46 --> 1216.38
meant to be and yeah find out soon

1210.71 --> 1220.46
enough or maybe not but once you find

1216.38 --> 1223.66
that right one you know I remember

1220.46 --> 1231.5
that's exactly how my dad and my mother

1223.66 --> 1247.16
that had me almost summoned you could

1231.5 --> 1257.74
say I'm here for a purpose but yeah I

1247.16 --> 1257.74
would like children least one maybe two

1257.83 --> 1265.33
and I'd say maximum three but who knows

1262.57 --> 1268.24
you know I don't know maybe it changed

1265.33 --> 1269.98
my mind maybe a lot of people are going

1268.24 --> 1272.169
to be suddenly dropping like flies and

1269.98 --> 1274.1490000000001
yeah there will be strong even false

1272.169 --> 1277.69
okay this is going wrong we need to

1274.149 --> 1285.539
repopulate but yeah that's this a stress

1277.69 --> 1285.539
scenario the love just see where it goes

1300.48 --> 1303.05
well

1309.19 --> 1320.019
hmm well I prefer to I prefer females at

1315.379 --> 1320.019
least half my age you know what I mean

1320.679 --> 1333.0800000000002
it sounds so bad but now I'm not

1330.59 --> 1336.4289999999999
interested in any of your daughters you

1333.08 --> 1336.4289999999999
know you wanna know

1348.76 --> 1359.14
I don't know I you know the thing about

1354.28 --> 1360.43
it is you really can't have kids in your

1359.14 --> 1362.67
responsible fashion

1360.43 --> 1367.6000000000001
unless you have something built

1362.67 --> 1371.14
something to have a foundation for them

1367.6 --> 1374.59
so and that's always been in my mind

1371.14 --> 1377.2
like yeah I do have to kind of make

1374.59 --> 1382.27
money and maybe a business or something

1377.2 --> 1384.7
of some kind that yeah one of these

1382.27 --> 1386.62
things must end up successful to some

1384.7 --> 1390.57
degree because otherwise I'll never be

1386.62 --> 1394.1399999999999
able to have a family responsibly so and

1390.57 --> 1394.1399999999999
we'll see where it goes

1403.809 --> 1406.59
hmm

1413.57 --> 1424.98
well that's not turning this into a

1416.31 --> 1427.61
dating show anyway the meaning of it all

1424.98 --> 1427.6100000000001
is to

1435.85 --> 1442.559
is to choose and then to make the best

1439.6 --> 1442.559
of your choices

1446.15 --> 1452.75
time no I'm not too mean that's the

1448.25 --> 1455.99
purpose of it all I think or the end

1452.75 --> 1458.419
results there are the most sensible

1455.99 --> 1466.7
approach whatever you want to see it

1458.419 --> 1469.9
like 42 guys nope nobody's paid me

1466.7 --> 1471.559
anything yet

1469.9 --> 1473.96
who knows you know

1471.559 --> 1476.75
once the super chats go keep start

1473.96 --> 1480.6490000000001
startup maybe I will get like

1476.75 --> 1484.159
sponsorship from them I don't I'm not

1480.649 --> 1489.799
like expecting it but I think I probably

1484.159 --> 1491.8600000000001
will be some yeah we'll see where that

1489.799 --> 1491.86
goes

1509.46 --> 1535.33
must be tracking somebody somebody must

1513.16 --> 1538.93
have tweeted something racism okay

1535.33 --> 1542.11
Michael O'Rourke the weird weather going

1538.93 --> 1545.44
on well as far as I can tell the way

1542.11 --> 1552.82
there's not weird at all I do know that

1545.44 --> 1555.3700000000001
the weather is seems to be unnatural or

1552.82 --> 1559.21
unusual in California for a long time

1555.37 --> 1560.59
unusual drought but I don't know I don't

1559.21 --> 1562.3600000000001
think the weather is weird at all

1560.59 --> 1565.3899999999999
absolutely not

1562.36 --> 1568.8999999999999
and if anything the weather is getting

1565.39 --> 1573.9
disturbed by the sudden local lack of

1568.9 --> 1577.5600000000002
co2 being emitted in cities zones I

1573.9 --> 1580.8100000000002
think if anything is gonna cause sudden

1577.56 --> 1590.9199999999998
climate shifting it's that it is the

1580.81 --> 1594.85
sudden change of gaseous output and you

1590.92 --> 1599.0800000000002
have to be fair I know it's it's Al Gore

1594.85 --> 1602.62
sacrilegious but I think as yeah the

1599.08 --> 1607.24
sooner the better we should start like

1602.62 --> 1610.75
literally pumping out co2 or just you

1607.24 --> 1615.1
know what do it controls just do it in

1610.75 --> 1620.92
forests have like forests with co2 gas

1615.1 --> 1625.0
lines with little valves so there's just

1620.92 --> 1627.16
regular like a solution of co2 and

1625.0 --> 1629.92
regular air to just enrich it you

1627.16 --> 1632.74
transfer it directly into the forest oh

1629.92 --> 1635.8600000000001
my god or use it for aggregate

1632.74 --> 1637.42
it's probably already being used for for

1635.86 --> 1639.7299999999998
it that's good

1637.42 --> 1644.8600000000001
we need co2 we need more the plants

1639.73 --> 1648.97
needed bad you know and we need the

1644.86 --> 1652.51
plants it's better for the weather

1648.97 --> 1657.6000000000001
stable stable it stability better

1652.51 --> 1665.26
against winds and all that better oxygen

1657.6 --> 1670.36
and more life animals are gonna thrive

1665.26 --> 1674.02
of that as well and so will we

1670.36 --> 1676.51
and humans will thrive from the thriving

1674.02 --> 1679.66
of trees of that energy that it radiates

1676.51 --> 1684.97
when it thrives so it's good we need

1679.66 --> 1691.3300000000002
that so yeah I am very much against the

1684.97 --> 1694.09
carbon dioxide phobia agenda so called

1691.33 --> 1697.57
climate change it's absolutely a

1694.09 --> 1699.97
preposterous and it and really an insult

1697.57 --> 1703.09
to my intelligence it's asinine because

1699.97 --> 1706.1200000000001
I am of an environmentalist was raised

1703.09 --> 1709.27
that way maybe a little zealous in my

1706.12 --> 1711.9699999999998
way so it's like a leftist trademark

1709.27 --> 1715.27
that I held onto because I am deeply

1711.97 --> 1717.64
come convicted in environmentalism

1715.27 --> 1720.67
against poison it's one of the reasons I

1717.64 --> 1723.1000000000001
eat is strictly organic even though

1720.67 --> 1726.94
that's not perfect but it's least the

1723.1 --> 1729.25
best you could do besides doing it

1726.94 --> 1732.5800000000002
yourself I don't have these options

1729.25 --> 1734.83
right now but yeah I am an

1732.58 --> 1738.1299999999999
environmentalist and poison and toxic

1734.83 --> 1740.26
waste is it has been always and still is

1738.13 --> 1743.5200000000002
to some degree a massive problem

1740.26 --> 1750.54
everywhere especially the accumulation

1743.52 --> 1756.309
accumulation of toxic wastes byproducts

1750.54 --> 1760.78
like fluoride like petrol side product

1756.309 --> 1761.47
waste really disgusting stuff and that

1760.78 --> 1765.55
is a problem

1761.47 --> 1766.63
so the problem about fossil fuels about

1765.55 --> 1769.93
oil

1766.63 --> 1773.2
is not the co2 that's like the only

1769.93 --> 1775.54
benefit often really the problem is is

1773.2 --> 1780.22
the pollution the benzene is getting

1775.54 --> 1784.42
ejected in the air and complex carbon

1780.22 --> 1787.84
molecules that are polluted and not to

1784.42 --> 1790.54
co2 that's like the better part but the

1787.84 --> 1793.4199999999998
complex carbon molecules and the side

1790.54 --> 1796.24
product wastes that's not part of the

1793.42 --> 1798.7
few but that's left behind after the

1796.24 --> 1807.75
chemical processes those are the problem

1798.7 --> 1812.74
CRT co2 is the only non problem in it so

1807.75 --> 1815.02
yeah pollution it's gonna every time

1812.74 --> 1817.9
every time you discover new chemical

1815.02 --> 1820.99
processes you discover new materials

1817.9 --> 1823.51
there's gonna be a new waste problem

1820.99 --> 1826.51
very likely to spring into being you

1823.51 --> 1828.61
might see it right away you might not

1826.51 --> 1830.65
see it coming it might be something that

1828.61 --> 1831.1899999999998
appears afterwards after you start using

1830.65 --> 1834.0700000000002
it

1831.19 --> 1835.6000000000001
well for example micro plastics is one

1834.07 --> 1838.99
of these things is one of the things

1835.6 --> 1842.1699999999998
that when plastic was introduced nobody

1838.99 --> 1844.8700000000001
saw that coming and it is a big problem

1842.17 --> 1848.44
right now nobody saw that coming

1844.87 --> 1854.77
really nobody so I didn't see it coming

1848.44 --> 1856.03
in but it is a problem and that's what

1854.77 --> 1858.97
we're always gonna have to deal with

1856.03 --> 1864.16
that's why environment environmentalism

1858.97 --> 1867.3700000000001
and holism in that sense always needs to

1864.16 --> 1871.26
be a part of the Union consciousness of

1867.37 --> 1874.62
people that will take that into account

1871.26 --> 1876.8799999999999
when new things are coming into being

1874.62 --> 1879.9399999999998
what's going to be the problem how can

1876.88 --> 1881.5900000000001
we work towards resolving the problems

1879.94 --> 1883.6000000000001
that will be coming with this new

1881.59 --> 1887.9199999999998
technology with this new technique this

1883.6 --> 1891.07
new material always somebody has to be

1887.92 --> 1892.8400000000001
on that because otherwise yeah the more

1891.07 --> 1894.7
things you're going to invent the more

1892.84 --> 1898.2099999999998
technology the more new things are going

1894.7 --> 1900.179
to be industrialized then suddenly the

1898.21 --> 1904.83
amount of junk that is going to pile

1900.179 --> 1908.659
it's gonna be catastrophic because of

1904.83 --> 1913.619
this and things are gonna be poison

1908.659 --> 1916.999
could be a lot of trouble reclaiming

1913.619 --> 1919.649
that toxified area that kind of thing

1916.999 --> 1921.539
there's already places on this earth

1919.649 --> 1924.4399999999998
that have this problem right now it's

1921.539 --> 1927.299
really aggravating

1924.44 --> 1933.509
and we need to work on that how do you

1927.299 --> 1935.6689999999999
clean it up and then of course how can

1933.509 --> 1938.7
you do it even cheaper and then how can

1935.669 --> 1942.24
you do that even cheaper but the

1938.7 --> 1945.1490000000001
effectiveness must be the exit but it

1942.24 --> 1946.919
much must be the objective must always

1945.149 --> 1949.08
be successful but yeah you always want

1946.919 --> 1951.3300000000002
to do it cheaper because it's extremely

1949.08 --> 1955.86
expensive nobody is willing to offer

1951.33 --> 1958.889
their money for it you know they it's

1955.86 --> 1962.1589999999999
unfortunate but people will vote against

1958.889 --> 1965.9089999999999
it they'd rather leave it there

1962.159 --> 1968.8790000000001
and just walk around it then pay for it

1965.909 --> 1972.69
to get it cleaned up unless it was

1968.879 --> 1974.399
really cheap and then it could be seen

1972.69 --> 1976.6490000000001
as an investment value look we clean it

1974.399 --> 1978.84
up and now you can actually do something

1976.649 --> 1982.4989999999998
with it and put it into your colony

1978.84 --> 1984.6
options so if it's cheap then suddenly

1982.499 --> 1987.09
it becomes a viable option to clean up

1984.6 --> 1991.9189999999999
that's also very important principle to

1987.09 --> 1999.6
keep in mind yeah so it's safe to say

1991.919 --> 2002.269
I'd love to end up in a job maybe on a

1999.6 --> 2004.61
think-tank or even at the head of a

2002.269 --> 2008.83
company that deals in environmental

2004.61 --> 2012.2589999999998
technology there's many concepts already

2008.83 --> 2015.59
pretty much fabricated in my mind and

2012.259 --> 2018.799
written down little that I would like to

2015.59 --> 2020.9289999999999
attempt once I get the resources and the

2018.799 --> 2022.33
connections do it all they have talked

2020.929 --> 2035.26
to some people about this

2022.33 --> 2036.1299999999999
so anybody wants to join the panel still

2035.26 --> 2040.36
open

2036.13 --> 2056.65
I mean rambling on for a half an hour

2040.36 --> 2061.29
now so at Elgar what is stage time he is

2056.65 --> 2064.54
like the rumpus of the mainstream media

2061.29 --> 2067.33
with his false promises and all his

2064.54 --> 2068.2799999999997
predictions that didn't come true but

2067.33 --> 2070.99
you guys think

2068.28 --> 2079.179
Elgar really is the rumpus of the

2070.99 --> 2081.3399999999997
mainstream media the specialist that is

2079.179 --> 2084.419
promoted

2081.34 --> 2084.4190000000003
[Music]

2090.749 --> 2097.589
well ajm that's it that's a statement

2094.379 --> 2107.489
that can use some analysis Trump into

2097.589 --> 2115.47
the savior and he's the fall guy well he

2107.489 --> 2119.13
is not the savior but he is somebody

2115.47 --> 2121.3489999999997
that could fix the situation and he has

2119.13 --> 2123.619
been trying to fix the situation and

2121.349 --> 2127.079
there's a lot of counter movement and

2123.619 --> 2130.589
yeah the opposition is trying to use him

2127.079 --> 2132.509
as a full guide very blatant very

2130.589 --> 2135.3289999999997
obvious they're blaming him for

2132.509 --> 2139.17
everything everything good that happens

2135.329 --> 2144.779
the credit is taken by by others by

2139.17 --> 2147.66
Obama for example in public so yeah he's

2144.779 --> 2150.809
not exactly the savior and he is being

2147.66 --> 2154.41
used as a fall guy but that doesn't mean

2150.809 --> 2156.829
that they will succeed at that and it

2154.41 --> 2159.749
also doesn't mean that once Trump

2156.829 --> 2163.619
actually completely overcomes this group

2159.749 --> 2167.1899999999996
and takes control that he will stay on

2163.619 --> 2171.569
the same course and that is the more

2167.19 --> 2174.569
risky part what will he do once he truly

2171.569 --> 2178.769
overcomes the opposition and what will

2174.569 --> 2181.079
be the ones that basically helped

2178.769 --> 2186.1189999999997
overthrow that opposition what will they

2181.079 --> 2188.4
do with the of the new power position

2186.119 --> 2191.099
they will be filling their lies a

2188.4 --> 2193.7690000000002
potential danger will the people still

2191.099 --> 2197.039
be upholding their principles or will

2193.769 --> 2198.6299999999997
they slowly gradually start to corrupt

2197.039 --> 2203.099
there is the big danger and that's

2198.63 --> 2207.42
always been my big morning to talk to

2203.099 --> 2209.279
Alex Jones and to other people that are

2207.42 --> 2211.9700000000003
very proud Trump like keep in mind

2209.279 --> 2214.079
always stay on the principles the

2211.97 --> 2218.4199999999996
libertarian principles are more

2214.079 --> 2220.8390000000004
important than any individuals and well

2218.42 --> 2226.839
byword at least

2220.839 --> 2227.95
they seem to confirm that and that's

2226.839 --> 2229.599
good that's good

2227.95 --> 2235.569
glad about that I don't know if he will

2229.599 --> 2237.67
actually do it but at least he he speaks

2235.569 --> 2239.799
out about it so we'll see we'll find out

2237.67 --> 2243.969
but yeah there's still some way to go

2239.799 --> 2247.5389999999998
before the the deep state and Muller and

2243.969 --> 2252.059
all these people these people that are

2247.539 --> 2254.1400000000003
just basically rumba singing in politics

2252.059 --> 2257.049
make you trying to make a mess of

2254.14 --> 2259.029
everything lying about as much causing

2257.049 --> 2263.979
as much friction and obstruction as

2259.029 --> 2270.119
possible these people will eventually be

2263.979 --> 2273.93
ejected and be in prison feel better and

2270.119 --> 2276.279
maybe even Hillary Clinton as well

2273.93 --> 2279.339
although that might take a little longer

2276.279 --> 2282.64
or maybe not it might all happen pretty

2279.339 --> 2284.849
rapidly all of a sudden but it may take

2282.64 --> 2289.6299999999997
a while until it gets to that point

2284.849 --> 2295.3590000000004
although yeah that could be 2019 or it

2289.63 --> 2297.7290000000003
could be 2020 I'll find out if you think

2295.359 --> 2302.41
about it politically yeah it's the the

2297.729 --> 2307.5389999999998
pragmatic potentially dirty thinking for

2302.41 --> 2311.109
thinking yeah a political stunt could be

2307.539 --> 2312.7000000000003
like to gain temporary momentum for a

2311.109 --> 2316.979
voting round for say another

2312.7 --> 2320.529
presidential election then imprisoning

2316.979 --> 2322.839
Hillary actually getting her tried and

2320.529 --> 2326.259
everything yeah my god that would

2322.839 --> 2328.15
suddenly give a massive response from

2326.259 --> 2330.249
people like finally it's happening

2328.15 --> 2332.14
they've been waiting on it so long and

2330.249 --> 2334.2099999999996
yeah they will definitely give him

2332.14 --> 2336.729
another chance even though he might have

2334.21 --> 2339.91
done some stuff that would be dubious or

2336.729 --> 2343.269
seems like poor choices or or if he's

2339.91 --> 2346.509
been asked because yeah Trump is a

2343.269 --> 2348.1299999999997
pretty cool guy but he is a human being

2346.509 --> 2350.68
and he's under a lot of pressure and

2348.13 --> 2353.7200000000003
even he can be an ass

2350.68 --> 2357.5299999999997
sometimes he does it on purpose is it

2353.72 --> 2359.6899999999996
it's counter social justice warrior

2357.53 --> 2363.0800000000004
attitude but sometimes he's just in a

2359.69 --> 2368.75
bad mood because he's a guy and wasn't

2363.08 --> 2371.0299999999997
shot but he might eventually maybe he

2368.75 --> 2373.49
does it sometimes I don't know I don't

2371.03 --> 2376.27
like talking about it in that way I

2373.49 --> 2378.9199999999996
really do respect Trump overall

2376.27 --> 2385.46
comparing him to the other presidents

2378.92 --> 2389.57
he's been a very cool and just positive

2385.46 --> 2391.58
guy I think yeah the international

2389.57 --> 2394.6400000000003
politics attitude that's something else

2391.58 --> 2397.25
but from the things he's actually done

2394.64 --> 2399.02
it seems to be just a really good guy

2397.25 --> 2402.71
trying to do the right thing trying to

2399.02 --> 2408.35
please everyone and find them just

2402.71 --> 2410.03
calmed the place down and yeah I do

2408.35 --> 2416.21
respect him for that so anyway enough

2410.03 --> 2424.0400000000004
about Trump then I think he's bad I'd

2416.21 --> 2430.51
have nothing against our each man yep

2424.04 --> 2430.5099999999998
agreed John Wayne oh yeah whoa No

2431.29 --> 2434.55
[Music]

2450.31 --> 2456.91
yeah but for now it's gonna be

2454.59 --> 2460.9300000000003
interesting it's gonna be pretty good

2456.91 --> 2465.85
and things are just gonna continue on

2460.93 --> 2470.3799999999997
and there's still more ground to gain in

2465.85 --> 2473.74
in this specific trajectory where we've

2470.38 --> 2476.83
not run out of space to grow in with

2473.74 --> 2479.58
what we do it's not good yeah so let's

2476.83 --> 2479.58
continue this

2510.68 --> 2521.3799999999997
oh yeah P Mars I blocked you because you

2517.55 --> 2521.38
were using that picture again

2527.49 --> 2535.5
and yeah you're not locked in here right

2530.01 --> 2537.51
so you're stealing chat there I just

2535.5 --> 2540.35
blocked you temporarily not permanently

2537.51 --> 2540.3500000000004
don't worry about it

2559.15 --> 2568.65
what yeah water is h2o it is yeah

2575.08 --> 2578.77
believe there's still people

2583.03 --> 2591.9900000000002
water is not a atom it is a molecule

2587.61 --> 2595.3
then when you use electrolyze you can

2591.99 --> 2606.04
split it up into distinct different

2595.3 --> 2608.38
gases with different abilities so an any

2606.04 --> 2610.75
salt you're gonna use to basically start

2608.38 --> 2616.63
up the electrolyzed process is gonna be

2610.75 --> 2619.45
left behind in its entirety complete the

2616.63 --> 2621.4300000000003
entire weight of the added salt the

2619.45 --> 2627.79
solution is going to be crystallized in

2621.43 --> 2630.0699999999997
the bottom of the empty canister that

2627.79 --> 2632.92
you used that you applied the process

2630.07 --> 2635.7400000000002
and so yeah the water in its entirety

2632.92 --> 2637.6
without anything added splits up into

2635.74 --> 2643.2
two different gases with two different

2637.6 --> 2643.2
properties so get over it

2655.77 --> 2658.77
mm-hmm

2681.08 --> 2693.7599999999998
Yeah right truth seeker me mafias 36

2686.68 --> 2698.69
that's right I pretty much agree that

2693.76 --> 2707.1200000000003
airplanes use very little fuel and they

2698.69 --> 2711.35
use advanced electrical engineering to

2707.12 --> 2715.8199999999997
basically self-perpetuate energy used

2711.35 --> 2719.89
for the yeah the thrust and it even has

2715.82 --> 2725.36
some levitation abilities so yeah it's

2719.89 --> 2728.2999999999997
it's a nice piece of advanced technology

2725.36 --> 2731.51
hidden in plain sight literally air in

2728.3 --> 2735.92
airplane in plain sight and I think it's

2731.51 --> 2739.67
genius at least they're yeah they're

2735.92 --> 2741.9500000000003
doing something like I'd rather have

2739.67 --> 2746.38
their they're using it and trying to

2741.95 --> 2746.3799999999997
hide it than not using it at all really

2755.67 --> 2767.38
yeah but it is pretty remarkable that

2759.82 --> 2773.6200000000003
they have come this and yeah it just

2767.38 --> 2778.9
shows everyone that the government and

2773.62 --> 2782.49
corporations can be and just if any

2778.9 --> 2787.81
story and if the story is well designed

2782.49 --> 2790.95
it will be believed it will be accepted

2787.81 --> 2794.0499999999997
even though what is actually visible and

2790.95 --> 2796.21
measurable just doesn't add up to that

2794.05 --> 2802.8700000000003
story most people don't get to that

2796.21 --> 2808.35
point and that's what a lot a what a lot

2802.87 --> 2808.35
of groups rely on on that concept

2814.55 --> 2817.7000000000003
it's gonna

2833.38 --> 2846.4
I wish somebody would come on be cool

2840.58 --> 2848.86
yeah you know I can talk on but when

2846.4 --> 2851.08
somebody's there then goes a lot more

2848.86 --> 2853.35
fluent for me so you guys must have

2851.08 --> 2856.77
noticed that right

2853.35 --> 2859.21
the only problem then is becoming that I

2856.77 --> 2862.5099999999998
tend to be coming any more long-winded

2859.21 --> 2863.79
and interrupted that's a problem and I'm

2862.51 --> 2866.05
working on it

2863.79 --> 2868.68
everyone should be working on that it's

2866.05 --> 2868.6800000000003
so difficult

2871.86 --> 2878.4700000000003
yeah there's nothing more difficult than

2875.58 --> 2881.2
communicating when you put a group of

2878.47 --> 2883.24
really smart people together that's

2881.2 --> 2885.8799999999997
usually the problem you end up with as

2883.24 --> 2893.7999999999997
the foundational problem for a lack of

2885.88 --> 2896.38
progress because people that are smart

2893.8 --> 2900.67
have their distinct opinion and their

2896.38 --> 2903.94
ego values that a lot so yeah people

2900.67 --> 2906.28
that are smart will in a group have more

2903.94 --> 2910.4500000000003
difficulty working together than just

2906.28 --> 2913.2400000000002
average people that'll just cooperate

2910.45 --> 2919.8399999999997
and follow orders pretty easily without

2913.24 --> 2922.5
considering too many things so yeah the

2919.84 --> 2922.5
great disadvantage

2937.89 --> 2947.95
so

2940.54 --> 2951.52
way yeah shout out to Randy Flat Earth

2947.95 --> 2956.02
and shout out to Nathan oh please shout

2951.52 --> 2962.79
out to Adam Eaton shout out to the the

2956.02 --> 2962.79
holy [ __ ] show shout-out to Chris very

2962.94 --> 2972.73
shout out to Travis from Red Hen radio

2968.07 --> 2975.9100000000003
yeah all of you guys have all offered to

2972.73 --> 2977.05
help out one way or the other and I

2975.91 --> 2981.85
really appreciate that

2977.05 --> 2984.13
so shout out for that and I also would

2981.85 --> 2989.74
love to have you as credits within the

2984.13 --> 2991.92
intro itself eventually and that will be

2989.74 --> 2991.9199999999996
cool

3004.03 --> 3010.63
hmm yeah I can talk about building I

3007.75 --> 3016.48
mean watching The Lord of the Rings like

3010.63 --> 3019.06
that movie and it's a really odd how it

3016.48 --> 3024.31
now looks completely different to me

3019.06 --> 3028.27
when I watch because Lord of the Rings

3024.31 --> 3030.94
is like a different mindset it's a

3028.27 --> 3033.34
different way of thinking

3030.94 --> 3036.31
socially of thinking about things the

3033.34 --> 3040.63
way they communicate it's like literally

3036.31 --> 3043.93
from a different era and it's kind of

3040.63 --> 3047.26
awkward many times and I've even noticed

3043.93 --> 3050.47
like in the eyes of the actors that they

3047.26 --> 3054.07
had real trouble like doing it in a

3050.47 --> 3057.52
natural way most like difficult for them

3054.07 --> 3063.7000000000003
but they really did try absolutely and

3057.52 --> 3067.92
it was very decent result but yeah I saw

3063.7 --> 3067.9199999999996
that a lot more about it and just

3071.19 --> 3080.71
thinking of its like what if somebody

3076.57 --> 3085.53
made like a remake of The Lord of the

3080.71 --> 3088.78
Rings but adapted in a more modern

3085.53 --> 3096.6400000000003
cultural way but how God not in the bad

3088.78 --> 3099.1600000000003
way not in rap or or like stupid girlie

3096.64 --> 3105.3399999999997
culture no nothing that sends modernized

3099.16 --> 3110.56
but make the people more competent and

3105.34 --> 3114.19
more sharp more real more games games of

3110.56 --> 3118.39
Thrones II but not necessarily with gore

3114.19 --> 3120.94
and treachery as brutal as that but what

3118.39 --> 3125.47
if yeah everybody was acting more like

3120.94 --> 3134.38
Oh like a real serious scenario like

3125.47 --> 3137.29
real war and real more optimal gritty

3134.38 --> 3137.76
maybe more not greedy in an overdone way

3137.29 --> 3140.7799999999997
but

3137.76 --> 3145.44
more the harsh reality feeling and not a

3140.78 --> 3151.1090000000004
romanticized fear romanticized oh we

3145.44 --> 3153.96
lost drama but more like oh [ __ ] this is

3151.109 --> 3157.41
real of kind of feeling I wonder what

3153.96 --> 3160.08
that would do now of course the music is

3157.41 --> 3165.93
not really adapted to that kind of

3160.08 --> 3168.84
setting but it might just surprisingly

3165.93 --> 3172.47
work out well to still keep that music

3168.84 --> 3174.75
but then make it more real because it

3172.47 --> 3178.3689999999997
would probably be even more impactful

3174.75 --> 3181.74
and you everyone would be less

3178.369 --> 3184.38
distracted by just the almost a natural

3181.74 --> 3187.109
seeming behavior which is not to blame

3184.38 --> 3191.9700000000003
just from another era and these are

3187.109 --> 3194.8199999999997
modern actors so they wouldn't be

3191.97 --> 3197.9399999999996
bothered by that and really latch on to

3194.82 --> 3200.04
the real realness of the characters and

3197.94 --> 3203.4
really get their story that music might

3200.04 --> 3206.91
make even more impact and the magical

3203.4 --> 3209.31
things that happen may seem even more

3206.91 --> 3211.7999999999997
magical more deep more straightforward

3209.31 --> 3215.82
because that is how I experienced

3211.8 --> 3218.79
actually reading models which I did way

3215.82 --> 3220.8590000000004
before the movies came up I it was the

3218.79 --> 3224.99
book that I voluntarily read from

3220.859 --> 3229.04
beginning to end in one summer in Spain

3224.99 --> 3229.04
it was delightful but

3230.54 --> 3238.369
tokine gets a little long whited in his

3233.72 --> 3242.6299999999997
details but he does also use that to

3238.369 --> 3246.38
build up tension and to get really close

3242.63 --> 3251.9300000000003
to your comfort zone that is one of the

3246.38 --> 3254.2400000000002
tricks that he does but yeah to get that

3251.93 --> 3262.73
across on movie you have to really make

3254.24 --> 3265.0099999999998
it more real and not adapted in a

3262.73 --> 3267.71
commercial way so that the widest

3265.01 --> 3273.26
audience will get it but just more more

3267.71 --> 3277.34
like a like a Saving Private Ryan hards

3273.26 --> 3282.619
movie that that sensation like the real

3277.34 --> 3287.9
serious rest of boom and just emphasize

3282.619 --> 3291.3500000000004
that and to be fair there are parts

3287.9 --> 3294.89
where they do this closely the Gondar is

3291.35 --> 3298.609
one of the better parts of the entire

3294.89 --> 3301.73
movie and how they portray the urgency

3298.609 --> 3303.5299999999997
and their culture in response to the

3301.73 --> 3307.25
scenario that we're playing out over the

3303.53 --> 3311.63
ages in middle-earth I like that part

3307.25 --> 3316.4
but there should be more of this urgency

3311.63 --> 3323.03
of the real this realness in my taste

3316.4 --> 3326.0
couldn't have an update anyway this is

3323.03 --> 3329.53
most I'm just mostly mostly Fanny faking

3326.0 --> 3335.09
around I guess or just being nitpicky

3329.53 --> 3342.5600000000004
but yeah if some of the old-fashioned

3335.09 --> 3346.76
this would be I don't know worked out a

3342.56 --> 3348.38
little bit more or less mythical and

3346.76 --> 3352.07
more direct

3348.38 --> 3354.859
I guess look if probably if somebody

3352.07 --> 3357.29
would do that in a movie then the

3354.859 --> 3359.69
Tolkien company would probably sue them

3357.29 --> 3361.56
for straying too far off the original

3359.69 --> 3364.89
concept of what

3361.56 --> 3367.68
of Tolkien's typical work mythologies

3364.89 --> 3371.43
and all that so it might not just it

3367.68 --> 3373.64
might just not be possible or maybe they

3371.43 --> 3378.2
will actually embrace it embrace and

3373.64 --> 3380.8199999999997
modernization knows it's up to them

3378.2 --> 3384.99
completely up to them or to the family

3380.82 --> 3386.8500000000004
company anyway that was a little bit

3384.99 --> 3389.43
about Lord of the Rings I still think

3386.85 --> 3397.25
it's a very good movie I think it's

3389.43 --> 3400.02
beautiful movie and if you look very

3397.25 --> 3402.63
sharply with sharp eyes with sharp

3400.02 --> 3404.85
details to facial expressions the waist

3402.63 --> 3408.06
eyes look yeah you will see a lot of

3404.85 --> 3409.95
like suppressed frustration with actors

3408.06 --> 3414.15
and everything that is very visible to

3409.95 --> 3417.5699999999997
me now but if you don't look so sharply

3414.15 --> 3421.02
and you just feel the story and feel

3417.57 --> 3422.88
these the cultures or basically what

3421.02 --> 3425.31
they're supposed to be and you will need

3422.88 --> 3428.76
to read the full book of Lord of the

3425.31 --> 3431.16
Rings to really get that and don't skip

3428.76 --> 3434.9900000000002
parts like really get it try to get what

3431.16 --> 3437.8799999999997
the feel is what he's trying to portray

3434.99 --> 3440.22
look at the types of consciousness he is

3437.88 --> 3442.61
trying to portray if you get that and

3440.22 --> 3447.6299999999997
you watch the movie by that standard

3442.61 --> 3449.9100000000003
then all of the ADI little details that

3447.63 --> 3453.12
are often won't bother you so much

3449.91 --> 3455.79
because you have the actual meaning

3453.12 --> 3458.43
that's supposed to be behind it -

3455.79 --> 3460.98
basically overlay that that's how I

3458.43 --> 3462.7799999999997
watched the first couple of times that

3460.98 --> 3465.05
I've watched it and suddenly now that

3462.78 --> 3468.84
I'm really looking at the details anyway

3465.05 --> 3473.07
that was it for the Lord of the Rings

3468.84 --> 3476.4300000000003
