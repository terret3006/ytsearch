166.16 --> 174.48
27 degrees right so

169.36 --> 176.8
that's the warmest day so far over here

174.48 --> 176.79999999999998
i think

178.72 --> 182.159
um weird

182.4 --> 187.04

186.4 --> 190.48000000000002
thing

190.48 --> 194.0
gets away

191.2 --> 196.72
yeah let's get it so that that got it

194.0 --> 196.72
away good

196.84 --> 199.84
uh

200.0 --> 205.519
hey steamy traveler it's 27 degrees it's

203.2 --> 207.04
it's kind of shirtless day but i managed

205.519 --> 210.31900000000002
to do it without

207.04 --> 213.599
also reinstalled my vent

210.319 --> 216.23899999999998
for emergencies

213.599 --> 218.159
remember this thing it's noisy so i'll

216.239 --> 219.20000000000002
try to prevent using it as much as

218.159 --> 226.159
possible because

219.2 --> 229.28
well here's why

226.159 --> 241.84
it's noisy as [ __ ] for those who

229.28 --> 241.84
remember from last year

252.879 --> 261.28
the g7 is over now it's nato's turn

256.479 --> 261.28
in the news if we in the news for a week

266.84 --> 269.84
yeah

274.8 --> 278.88
right good surfing sauce it's probably

277.52 --> 282.24
hot over there in the us

278.88 --> 284.08
as well right it's this kind of warm

282.24 --> 287.919
it's usually warm everywhere in the

284.08 --> 287.919
north for most of it

294.72 --> 298.32000000000005
cook ethics on a carb

299.759 --> 302.8
yeah man one of the jack dot when i went

302.16 --> 304.32000000000005
outside

302.8 --> 306.8
for the first time today there was this

304.32 --> 310.0
jack don just laying on the roof like

306.8 --> 314.16
this like i thought it was dead

310.0 --> 317.36
like dude did did it just die from heat

314.16 --> 319.36
right there but then as he saw me coming

317.36 --> 320.0
he immediately like got up and then flew

319.36 --> 323.12
away

320.0 --> 326.56
but it looked like really like

323.12 --> 329.6
it just laid completely weirded

326.56 --> 331.6
warped with its

329.6 --> 333.28000000000003
yeah with its chin up so it looked

331.6 --> 336.88
really weird

333.28 --> 340.63899999999995
it's just trying to get some airflow

336.88 --> 343.36
or something get rid of the heat

340.639 --> 345.039
so yeah the birds are all mouth beak

343.36 --> 346.88
open

345.039 --> 348.08
gave them some fresh new water which

346.88 --> 353.84
they just almost

348.08 --> 353.84
immediately some magpie stormed in there

361.52 --> 366.0
now i'm not gonna cook an egg on a car

363.6 --> 367.44
because i don't have a car

366.0 --> 372.0
don't think somebody else is going to

367.44 --> 372.0
appreciate if i cook an egg on their car

374.56 --> 378.319
150 i don't know how much that is in

376.8 --> 382.24
fahrenheit

378.319 --> 382.24
it's just this fahrenheit is really

384.4 --> 387.919
it's a hundred how much let's say all

387.52 --> 390.31899999999996
right

387.919 --> 390.31899999999996
forty

393.52 --> 402.4
60 degrees are you serious that's deadly

398.639 --> 402.40000000000003
that's freaking sahara level

405.919 --> 409.19899999999996
that wait yeah that that would be 140

408.16 --> 412.24
degrees

409.199 --> 415.52000000000004
uh i'm saying 115

412.24 --> 417.759
fahrenheit to celsius

415.52 --> 423.84
all right it's 46 is still freaking

417.759 --> 423.84000000000003
insanely hot

428.0 --> 431.52
all right so hot hot hot

432.88 --> 440.56
right yesterday watched some football

437.44 --> 444.8
it was just in time see the first

440.56 --> 447.12
dutch european match

444.8 --> 447.12
game

448.08 --> 453.599
and it was fun it was an exciting game

450.479 --> 453.599
to see and we won

457.759 --> 465.759
right and yeah some intricacies about

462.56 --> 468.879
that player is it from denmark

465.759 --> 472.08000000000004
who i got a heart attack apparently

468.879 --> 473.52000000000004
is it the day before in the middle of a

472.08 --> 477.12
game

473.52 --> 479.35999999999996
and i just really noticed really noticed

477.12 --> 483.36
like i had a question

479.36 --> 483.36
of course as i am well

483.599 --> 489.039
the conspiracy there is immediately it's

487.039 --> 492.31899999999996
of course like okay so did he take the

489.039 --> 495.36
facts did he

492.319 --> 497.599
it's just like somebody going on a weird

495.36 --> 499.199
suicide murder rampage like the first

497.599 --> 500.15999999999997
question is going to be like oh was he

499.199 --> 503.759
on rein

500.16 --> 505.68
re-up re-inhibit up

503.759 --> 507.759
uptake re-inhibitors what is it called

505.68 --> 511.479
again

507.759 --> 514.64
the yeah the

511.479 --> 517.36
antidepressant pharmaceutical

514.64 --> 517.919
that typically causes that so it's like

517.36 --> 520.64
with this

517.919 --> 522.7189999999999
guy it's like oh heart attack right did

520.64 --> 525.519
he get a coronafx

522.719 --> 527.0400000000001
and then one of the players from the

525.519 --> 530.32
netherlands in an interview

527.04 --> 534.0
even brought him up got all emotional

530.32 --> 537.6
and was like yeah let's not

534.0 --> 539.2
speculate on like how he got that heart

537.6 --> 542.9590000000001
attack and

539.2 --> 546.9590000000001
it's like oh and he even like ex

542.959 --> 548.88
like he kept it under wraps

546.959 --> 550.3199999999999
as not to reveal too much but he was

548.88 --> 552.32
basically saying

550.32 --> 553.7600000000001
i could just feel it from him like yeah

552.32 --> 556.32
i'm scared

553.76 --> 557.04
because we know that guy took the facts

556.32 --> 559.36
and i took

557.04 --> 560.3199999999999
it too and now i'm scared will i get a

559.36 --> 563.76
heart attack

560.32 --> 565.279
seriously i heard that he didn't

563.76 --> 568.64
literally say that but

565.279 --> 568.64
he pretty much said that

571.04 --> 577.8389999999999
so yeah that happened

580.24 --> 584.72
right but yeah that was like afterward

583.2 --> 587.44
the game itself was very

584.72 --> 587.44
interesting and

587.92 --> 592.0
this was a good match to watch i usually

590.72 --> 595.2
i'm not big fan of

592.0 --> 599.12
soccer football

595.2 --> 601.44
but yeah the the more international

599.12 --> 604.399
tournaments i i do typically watch them

601.44 --> 606.8800000000001
when the netherlands is in him

604.399 --> 606.88
i don't know

608.24 --> 611.76
but i've never been much of a club

610.48 --> 619.839
football guy

611.76 --> 619.8389999999999
at all anyway huh

625.6 --> 629.9200000000001
how are you guys doing except for the

630.839 --> 633.839
heat

636.48 --> 640.0790000000001
right i managed to find a name for

638.24 --> 642.9590000000001
yesterday's episode by the way i don't

640.079 --> 642.959
know if you've noticed

643.519 --> 648.8
i watched it all back and i thought it

645.68 --> 650.3199999999999
was a really good show

648.8 --> 652.56
all right anyway i called it

650.32 --> 654.5600000000001
spectroscopy coriolis effect and why

652.56 --> 656.2399999999999
machines will always need humans

654.56 --> 661.8389999999999
i thought that was a pretty good title

656.24 --> 661.839
for that show

663.279 --> 667.12
and it was interesting to listen back

670.079 --> 674.0
it's good garden ground great yeah as

672.72 --> 677.519
long as you give it all enough

674.0 --> 680.64
water look my herb

677.519 --> 684.64
plants in the kitchen

680.64 --> 687.8389999999999
they're like totally crushing it like

684.64 --> 690.88
even like the basil plants

687.839 --> 693.9200000000001
they're like giving side sprouts

690.88 --> 695.92
like in the corn like in armpits of

693.92 --> 698.88
lower leaves they're like starting to

695.92 --> 701.36
grow new branches like they are really

698.88 --> 703.12
yeah they really appreciate this heat

701.36 --> 706.24
and i give them like water three

703.12 --> 708.48
four times a day so they never dry out

706.24 --> 710.639
yeah i got a parsley

708.48 --> 713.9200000000001
plant and they like need constant

710.639 --> 716.32
watering or they'll dry out very quickly

713.92 --> 718.4799999999999
but yeah all the plants are absolutely

716.32 --> 731.839
appreciating this type of heat

718.48 --> 731.839
as long as they get enough water

739.68 --> 743.4399999999999
notice that in the summertime in the

741.279 --> 746.32
north hemisphere

743.44 --> 748.639
very hard to find anywhere in the club

746.32 --> 752.72
what

748.639 --> 755.76
right so yeah andy

752.72 --> 759.76
skips hello welcome to my chat

755.76 --> 762.8
i think you mean like that the winters

759.76 --> 766.48
in the south are not as cold

762.8 --> 766.4799999999999
as the winters in the north

766.56 --> 770.959
on average yet there might be something

768.48 --> 774.5600000000001
to that it's weird

770.959 --> 778.2399999999999
in the same way by the way the winters

774.56 --> 780.4799999999999
in the south are not that cold

778.24 --> 787.839
right are and the summers are well the

780.48 --> 790.88
summers are kind of hot though

787.839 --> 792.32
but then again they're hot over here as

790.88 --> 794.72
well so maybe

792.32 --> 795.36
i don't know but yeah the the north and

794.72 --> 796.88
the south

795.36 --> 798.9590000000001
are a little different in their

796.88 --> 801.8389999999999
seasoning i know

798.959 --> 801.8389999999999
it's weird

815.519 --> 818.88
i think probably the best way to average

818.399 --> 822.0
out

818.88 --> 822.88
the temperatures would be to measure it

822.0 --> 824.52
directly

822.88 --> 826.079
like at c

824.52 --> 828.56
[Music]

826.079 --> 829.12
like what is the heat at sea in the

828.56 --> 833.92
north

829.12 --> 833.92
what is the heat at sea in the south

836.0 --> 842.48
because yeah when it's very deeply land

839.199 --> 845.3599999999999
inwards it always gets gets a lot hotter

842.48 --> 847.76
and also tends to get a lot cooler

845.36 --> 848.88
than if it's at sea when it averages out

847.76 --> 850.959
more

848.88 --> 852.399
but because of that you can also just

850.959 --> 856.88
get a better

852.399 --> 860.399
well average reading

856.88 --> 862.24
on what any differences might be

860.399 --> 871.839
in temperature in the north and south in

862.24 --> 871.839
the seasons

872.48 --> 880.24
the coldest temperature measured

876.24 --> 880.24
in antarctica yeah no doubt

881.36 --> 886.399
i wonder though you know is there also a

884.639 --> 889.519
distinct temperature difference

886.399 --> 893.76
in the north and so yeah or in the south

889.519 --> 898.16
at antarctica during summer and winter

893.76 --> 901.76
or does it become kind of insignificant

898.16 --> 905.04
or is it simply that in the summer

901.76 --> 907.199
well summer for the south

905.04 --> 908.639
it's still very cold it's just that in

907.199 --> 912.959
the winter it's even

908.639 --> 916.9590000000001
more bitter cold i don't know probably

912.959 --> 916.959
it's just very cold over there always

917.92 --> 921.199
it's not like the ice ever melts except

920.72 --> 924.88
maybe

921.199 --> 929.8389999999999
the the one the ice floating

924.88 --> 929.8389999999999
directly over the ocean that's built up

938.839 --> 946.48
there

941.839 --> 946.48
find me somewhere cold on the planet

946.639 --> 950.32
yeah they're well their model is kind of

949.199 --> 953.199
rubbish

950.32 --> 956.639
in many many ways although like how the

953.199 --> 956.639
temperatures are laid out

957.6 --> 961.0400000000001
the real seasonal effects it is a bit of

960.079 --> 964.079
a mystery though

961.04 --> 965.12
like even even in my opinion on the flat

964.079 --> 967.4399999999999
earth

965.12 --> 968.48
model even if you're gonna go by disc or

967.44 --> 972.0
any anytime

968.48 --> 983.839
type of setup it's still kind of

972.0 --> 983.839
mysterious to me

987.759 --> 990.0790000000001
whoa

991.199 --> 999.519
minus 70 71 sheesh

996.0 --> 999.519
jared sanford that's really cold

1007.839 --> 1011.839
hey seeking star water

1020.959 --> 1026.0
got no tea today not surprisingly

1024.16 --> 1029.6000000000001
do have some water i put it in the

1026.0 --> 1029.6
fridge but it's already

1030.0 --> 1033.039
regular temperature

1036.24 --> 1039.839
better than nothing

1046.559 --> 1054.6399999999999
all right so yesterday

1051.84 --> 1067.84
[Music]

1054.64 --> 1067.8400000000001

1081.039 --> 1084.4
too many videos out there

1085.679 --> 1089.2800000000002
just enjoyed the nice weather

1093.039 --> 1098.0
man i had really extensive dreams this

1095.76 --> 1098.0
night

1099.12 --> 1102.799
i'm still stuck in my head that and like

1102.0 --> 1105.039
there was a

1102.799 --> 1106.8799999999999
real puzzle going on and i was trying to

1105.039 --> 1109.76
puzzle it out

1106.88 --> 1112.7990000000002
maybe an influence was that i kind of

1109.76 --> 1116.08
watched the ninth gate

1112.799 --> 1116.08
before going to bed

1116.24 --> 1120.88
although it didn't terrify me as much

1121.679 --> 1126.799
as it has in the past that that movie is

1124.24 --> 1130.08
really freaky

1126.799 --> 1136.0
it's like so eerie so much like

1130.08 --> 1138.96
dark frequency being reenacted in people

1136.0 --> 1142.96
really creeped me out but i guess that

1138.96 --> 1142.96
it has set me to dreaming again

1143.039 --> 1153.919
just puzzling out things

1151.76 --> 1155.039
because yeah movie like that really give

1153.919 --> 1158.64
me the feeling like

1155.039 --> 1158.64
everybody's staring at me

1158.799 --> 1162.799
from from within the dark world gives me

1161.52 --> 1164.48
that feeling a lot

1162.799 --> 1168.96
and then i kind of get this weird

1164.48 --> 1168.96
virtual negotiation thing happening

1169.6 --> 1172.32
it's weird

1173.84 --> 1178.559
i get reminded by big chunks of my

1176.08 --> 1181.039
vision in the past

1178.559 --> 1183.12
like especially how i responded to it

1181.039 --> 1185.919
back then

1183.12 --> 1188.0
like my visions constantly remind me

1185.919 --> 1191.2
basically at how

1188.0 --> 1193.2
incapable i really was of dealing with

1191.2 --> 1196.32
those things back then

1193.2 --> 1198.24
even though i was really mostly trying

1196.32 --> 1201.12
to convince myself that i

1198.24 --> 1201.84
would the end that i had to in a way

1201.12 --> 1205.12
it's just

1201.84 --> 1205.12
so weird

1205.52 --> 1209.76
right it's probably not making things

1207.84 --> 1210.08
more clear for you guys like this but

1209.76 --> 1213.919
it's

1210.08 --> 1213.9189999999999
it's all just very ethereal

1214.48 --> 1220.799
lots of dreaming pretty much up until i

1216.48 --> 1225.52
woke up

1220.799 --> 1225.52
which was roughly an hour and 15 minutes

1232.84 --> 1237.28
ago

1234.96 --> 1238.72
so what have you guys and girls been up

1237.28 --> 1242.08
to

1238.72 --> 1243.6000000000001
anything you you would like me to

1242.08 --> 1246.32
address

1243.6 --> 1248.48
dressed several subjects yesterday did

1246.32 --> 1251.84
some explanations

1248.48 --> 1251.84
i'd love to do that again

1252.88 --> 1263.8400000000001
maybe new subjects

1274.72 --> 1281.919
i was informed once that there was

1278.559 --> 1283.36
no such thing as a paladin and it broke

1281.919 --> 1291.8400000000001
you what

1283.36 --> 1291.84
but in what context

1302.84 --> 1305.84
so

1312.64 --> 1316.7990000000002
right in what context because what is a

1315.2 --> 1320.24
paladin

1316.799 --> 1323.28
if a paladin is really rich and has

1320.24 --> 1333.84
power then he's not really a paladin

1323.28 --> 1333.84
that doesn't work

1341.84 --> 1361.84
no one makes to heaven

1345.679 --> 1361.8400000000001
in their own way what what do you mean

1363.919 --> 1367.2800000000002
hello libby by the way

1368.88 --> 1375.8400000000001
yeah seriously what are you talking

1372.84 --> 1375.84
about

1400.84 --> 1403.84
so

1408.0 --> 1411.919
george center yeah i'd say lots of them

1410.0 --> 1415.36
yeah probably

1411.919 --> 1416.24
but the critical the absolute critical

1415.36 --> 1420.0
cornerstone

1416.24 --> 1423.84
of being a paladin is morality

1420.0 --> 1426.88
at all time right there's order

1423.84 --> 1431.039
and there's morality

1426.88 --> 1431.919
and like even just within freaking game

1431.039 --> 1435.52
enactments of

1431.919 --> 1437.8400000000001
it so roughly based on the idea

1435.52 --> 1440.08
it's always juggling between keeping

1437.84 --> 1441.52
order and staying moral right if you get

1440.08 --> 1443.6789999999999
too moral then chaos

1441.52 --> 1445.6
eventually will break out if you forgive

1443.679 --> 1448.96
too many enemies

1445.6 --> 1452.0
eventually they will turn on you yeah

1448.96 --> 1455.039
and so it's like a very rough

1452.0 --> 1457.36
balance for a paladin in games it's

1455.039 --> 1459.84
a lot of personal conflict because of

1457.36 --> 1459.84
that

1460.4 --> 1466.48
so yeah look people back then

1463.919 --> 1467.8400000000001
they've simply said okay this this is a

1466.48 --> 1470.96
paladin

1467.84 --> 1474.32
because he's a really great leader but

1470.96 --> 1478.64
is he also a moral leader or is he more

1474.32 --> 1482.3999999999999
moral than the rest moral enough it's

1478.64 --> 1483.039
right that's why the idea of a paladin

1482.4 --> 1486.0
is

1483.039 --> 1488.32
is kind of like similar to the idea of

1486.0 --> 1491.6
an ideology

1488.32 --> 1494.6399999999999
it's practically kind of impossible to

1491.6 --> 1494.6399999999999
do it perfectly

1494.96 --> 1501.8400000000001
it doesn't mean that you can't try in

1497.12 --> 1501.84
some way

1504.799 --> 1508.72
you were told that you can't beat the

1506.72 --> 1515.44
system when i was young

1508.72 --> 1519.039
well you can't you can't really

1515.44 --> 1523.039
but as a paladin you can create

1519.039 --> 1526.48
kind of safe spaces against the system

1523.039 --> 1526.48
or within the system

1527.36 --> 1530.32
that is possible

1534.0 --> 1539.12
right but one of the important things

1536.24 --> 1539.1200000000001
for a paladin

1539.2 --> 1547.2
is you have basically two lords you have

1542.559 --> 1550.48
lord god master of morality

1547.2 --> 1556.32
and justice and then you have

1550.48 --> 1557.44
the lord of the land the ruler which

1556.32 --> 1561.84
kind of stands for

1557.44 --> 1564.64
the nation right the leadership official

1561.84 --> 1567.6399999999999
and a paladin also well would have to

1564.64 --> 1570.0
obey that unless that leader is like

1567.64 --> 1572.88
unbelievably corrupt and would

1570.0 --> 1578.08
eventually destroy

1572.88 --> 1578.0800000000002
the leadership right it's

1582.84 --> 1585.84
complicated

1595.84 --> 1601.4399999999998
the holes in the fabric of the firmament

1599.12 --> 1601.4399999999998
what

1606.64 --> 1610.5590000000002
no okay that's an interesting idea andy

1609.679 --> 1613.2
skips

1610.559 --> 1615.12
but the problem is if there was a

1613.2 --> 1617.2
literal euclidean

1615.12 --> 1618.9599999999998
position of a hole through which light

1617.2 --> 1621.76
comes etc etc

1618.96 --> 1621.76
well guess what

1622.08 --> 1626.08
perspective effects right so there's a

1625.2 --> 1627.919
hole

1626.08 --> 1629.1999999999998
well that means there's a diffraction

1627.919 --> 1631.039
effect

1629.2 --> 1634.64
right because that's what happens when

1631.039 --> 1634.64
light shines through a hole

1634.88 --> 1638.8400000000001
physically right there's all kinds of

1638.0 --> 1641.44
things

1638.84 --> 1643.52
consequences of light going through

1641.44 --> 1647.679
holes

1643.52 --> 1647.679
so that's not what we're seeing

1648.32 --> 1652.48
and besides if light was literally

1651.039 --> 1654.24
coming through some holes

1652.48 --> 1656.48
whether it's out of reach or not in a

1654.24 --> 1656.799
firmament but if there's literally like

1656.48 --> 1658.96
a

1656.799 --> 1660.6399999999999
physical thing with holes that would be

1658.96 --> 1663.039
moving

1660.64 --> 1664.0
well then you would be able to see those

1663.039 --> 1667.2
stars

1664.0 --> 1668.64
at all time no matter how high up you go

1667.2 --> 1670.799
they would never disappear because

1668.64 --> 1671.6000000000001
there's literally a physical literal

1670.799 --> 1674.8799999999999
position

1671.6 --> 1679.279
pre-assumed in this setup

1674.88 --> 1681.44
where light is coming through the hole

1679.279 --> 1682.48
in for square law would apply so the

1681.44 --> 1685.1200000000001
sooner

1682.48 --> 1687.279
the sooner you approach it the brighter

1685.12 --> 1690.6399999999999
it gets well that doesn't happen

1687.279 --> 1693.279
so yeah it's an interesting

1690.64 --> 1695.279
idea and especially when you compare it

1693.279 --> 1697.36
to things like the solar eclipse

1695.279 --> 1699.76
it really does look like there's a big

1697.36 --> 1701.4399999999998
rock rolling in front of a hole

1699.76 --> 1704.0
through which the sun comes it kind of

1701.44 --> 1708.559
looks like that to me too

1704.0 --> 1708.559
but that's the mind interpreting the

1708.84 --> 1711.84
visuals

1714.159 --> 1721.0390000000002
if there were holes in the ferment oh

1717.679 --> 1721.039
okay yeah

1721.919 --> 1725.8400000000001
well that's not i wasn't assuming that

1725.039 --> 1729.12
you would be

1725.84 --> 1733.36
assuming that there was any holes to

1729.12 --> 1736.399
light doesn't mean that it would be

1733.36 --> 1739.1999999999998
open space in those holes it would

1736.399 --> 1741.6399999999999
simply be

1739.2 --> 1743.279
physically transparent versus

1741.64 --> 1744.88
non-transparent

1743.279 --> 1746.96
and there would probably be another

1744.88 --> 1749.1200000000001
layer in between

1746.96 --> 1752.88
to prevent the gaze the gas from

1749.12 --> 1756.08
escaping through those holes

1752.88 --> 1767.8400000000001
by that mind experiment

1756.08 --> 1767.84
that you presented

1771.36 --> 1781.84
light change positions

1787.52 --> 1797.84
taking a bath

1795.52 --> 1797.84
wow

1799.12 --> 1809.84
he is wet all right

1812.159 --> 1816.3990000000001
right so yeah i appreciate the uh the

1815.2 --> 1819.3600000000001
thought

1816.399 --> 1821.12
anybody else i am pretty doing pretty

1819.36 --> 1824.24
good by the way

1821.12 --> 1827.84
no more nuisance from my jaw

1824.24 --> 1827.84
that seems to have gone away again

1828.559 --> 1832.48
and i don't think it was the lasagna

1830.32 --> 1834.24
because i still ate lasagna yesterday it

1832.48 --> 1836.08
was really nice

1834.24 --> 1839.36
to really be careful not to start

1836.08 --> 1839.36
engorging that [ __ ]

1839.76 --> 1842.559
eat too much

1844.399 --> 1848.4799999999998
it's just too much cheese isn't that

1846.24 --> 1852.32
really good

1848.48 --> 1854.3990000000001
but it's so tasty but yeah today i'm

1852.32 --> 1860.08
doing great

1854.399 --> 1860.08
but it's hot but i'm very focused i

1862.84 --> 1865.84
think

1874.72 --> 1878.559
some stars do appear like some kind of

1877.12 --> 1881.1999999999998
lens

1878.559 --> 1882.799
when viewed through a real telescope

1881.2 --> 1885.3600000000001
really does it

1882.799 --> 1888.8799999999999
or maybe that could simply be well since

1885.36 --> 1888.8799999999999
you're looking through a lens

1890.84 --> 1895.4399999999998
right

1892.96 --> 1895.44
maybe the

1896.0 --> 1900.72
the holographic nature of the light

1898.919 --> 1903.279
manifestation

1900.72 --> 1904.08
is kind of taking on the form of the

1903.279 --> 1906.48
observer

1904.08 --> 1910.0
like that maybe that's why it can be

1906.48 --> 1910.0
made to look like a lens

1911.12 --> 1916.559
because your focus would kind of like

1913.84 --> 1916.559
make it so

1916.799 --> 1920.08
but even though yeah whatever you're

1918.96 --> 1923.279
looking at it might

1920.08 --> 1926.72
look like something like a lens but

1923.279 --> 1930.159
is it literally because

1926.72 --> 1933.44
virtually how far would that star

1930.159 --> 1934.0
be away like if you were assuming was on

1933.44 --> 1937.3600000000001
the dome

1934.0 --> 1940.399
or whatever can your telescope

1937.36 --> 1943.039
actually reach that far

1940.399 --> 1943.039
visually

1947.519 --> 1951.76
you know it's a question you should be

1949.519 --> 1955.279
asking

1951.76 --> 1959.519
like when you look up does your site

1955.279 --> 1962.559
actually reach towards the firmament

1959.519 --> 1962.88
can you like the physical part of it can

1962.559 --> 1965.9189999999999
you

1962.88 --> 1968.159
actually physically see that far

1965.919 --> 1970.0
right it's an important question to ask

1968.159 --> 1974.88
yourself

1970.0 --> 1974.88
can you actually when you look up see

1975.36 --> 1978.6399999999999
like things

1980.08 --> 1986.0
can your site actually reach until the

1982.88 --> 1986.0
end of the container

1989.44 --> 1993.039
right in order for you to assume that

1991.6 --> 1996.6399999999999
stars might be like

1993.039 --> 2000.399
in the firmament literally like in

1996.64 --> 2004.0
the dome or flat top whatever that is

2000.399 --> 2007.1999999999998
can your side actually reach that far

2004.0 --> 2010.24
or is it just another mistake

2007.2 --> 2010.96
is lights in the firmament kind of

2010.24 --> 2013.679
another way

2010.96 --> 2014.799
of saying like in the holographic

2013.679 --> 2016.799
projector

2014.799 --> 2018.8799999999999
like that's the only way you'll ever see

2016.799 --> 2020.24
it it's always out of reach it's

2018.88 --> 2023.6000000000001
holographic like you're

2020.24 --> 2026.559
staring at a

2023.6 --> 2029.12
dome whatever you're staring at it and

2026.559 --> 2030.559
it has a holographic projection within

2029.12 --> 2032.399
it

2030.559 --> 2033.6789999999999
but that means it's not actually

2032.399 --> 2038.6399999999999
literally like

2033.679 --> 2044.3200000000002
little lights in it it's just that

2038.64 --> 2046.159
it would allow the hologram to manifest

2044.32 --> 2047.84
and hey when you can never reach

2046.159 --> 2048.32
something like a hologram yeah you could

2047.84 --> 2050.0
say

2048.32 --> 2051.3590000000004
it's out of reach it's inside the

2050.0 --> 2054.399
firmament

2051.359 --> 2057.919
so it's the thereby always out of reach

2054.399 --> 2062.0
right these are all solutions

2057.919 --> 2064.72
to mind interpretation problems

2062.0 --> 2065.359
right i think that it was said that the

2064.72 --> 2068.399
lights are

2065.359 --> 2070.56
in the verbament

2068.399 --> 2073.1189999999997
because there was just no way they would

2070.56 --> 2077.52
ever be able to describe

2073.119 --> 2080.8
holographic nature of light to people

2077.52 --> 2080.8
in the classical era

2081.52 --> 2084.8
they probably already thought that

2083.44 --> 2087.28
mirror stuff

2084.8 --> 2089.599
which probably magicians would have been

2087.28 --> 2092.8
capable of trekking with for a long

2089.599 --> 2095.04
long long time probably would have

2092.8 --> 2096.639
freaked them out

2095.04 --> 2098.96
right so how are you ever going to

2096.639 --> 2102.2400000000002
explain a holographic nature

2098.96 --> 2105.359
to just a regular group of people

2102.24 --> 2106.24
you want you just say no it's the lights

2105.359 --> 2108.4
yeah they're

2106.24 --> 2109.2799999999997
in the firmament and so you can never

2108.4 --> 2112.48
reach it

2109.28 --> 2112.96
right so is that sufficient to make you

2112.48 --> 2116.64
stop

2112.96 --> 2121.28
asking more questions about it yes

2116.64 --> 2121.2799999999997
good right

2127.839 --> 2133.04
how far is the sun and star it has no

2130.48 --> 2133.04
distance

2135.28 --> 2139.2000000000003
the sun and the stars are light-based

2138.24 --> 2142.8799999999997
holographic

2139.2 --> 2143.68
phenomena they have no actual position

2142.88 --> 2147.119
they only have

2143.68 --> 2147.5989999999997
apparent angular positions in relation

2147.119 --> 2152.079
to

2147.599 --> 2152.079
observers full sword

2152.16 --> 2160.16
they just don't have an

2155.359 --> 2160.16
actual euclidean position in space

2169.839 --> 2174.32
right every time i say it it's

2171.76 --> 2177.44
holographic it's holographic

2174.32 --> 2178.0
it's very serious when i say that it's

2177.44 --> 2181.76
not like

2178.0 --> 2184.96
ooh quickly roughly tried to grab it

2181.76 --> 2189.15
no i'm i'm getting more and more serious

2184.96 --> 2192.26
about the holographic nature like it is

2189.15 --> 2192.26
[Music]

2194.72 --> 2199.68
grams and yeah of course immediately the

2198.079 --> 2201.44
technician and some people is going to

2199.68 --> 2202.3199999999997
say okay so where is it being projected

2201.44 --> 2204.8
from

2202.32 --> 2206.88
where is the reflecting thing because

2204.8 --> 2207.6800000000003
that's how we know holograms work here

2206.88 --> 2210.0
on earth

2207.68 --> 2212.56
right so where is it where's the back

2210.0 --> 2215.44
engineered

2212.56 --> 2217.04
right yeah i i don't know man i don't

2215.44 --> 2220.079
even know how this is

2217.04 --> 2222.96
possible i just know

2220.079 --> 2222.96
from the data

2223.28 --> 2228.6400000000003
this is what it seems to be holographic

2225.76 --> 2232.6400000000003
at the edge of vision

2228.64 --> 2235.04
no actual positions of any of it

2232.64 --> 2236.0789999999997
you could basically map out how it all

2235.04 --> 2240.32
worked

2236.079 --> 2242.8
on line based systems

2240.32 --> 2245.52
i've even thought about this like what

2242.8 --> 2245.52
would that do

2245.599 --> 2251.6800000000003
if you literally take every observer

2249.2 --> 2252.72
or observation at every point on the

2251.68 --> 2256.0
earth

2252.72 --> 2259.2799999999997
every point on the earth and just

2256.0 --> 2262.24
show okay how do the lights manifest

2259.28 --> 2265.8390000000004
there and then draw them out

2262.24 --> 2268.9599999999996
as lines on a set distance lines

2265.839 --> 2272.24
towards the observer right

2268.96 --> 2275.2
and then take those sketches of that

2272.24 --> 2276.5989999999997
would be 3d hopefully and have that

2275.2 --> 2280.56
everywhere

2276.599 --> 2280.56
everywhere and then maybe

2281.44 --> 2286.0
yeah kind of a wire framy looking

2284.96 --> 2288.2400000000002
pattern could be

2286.0 --> 2291.2
derived from that to kind of give a

2288.24 --> 2293.2
better idea of like how all this light

2291.2 --> 2295.7599999999998
is manifesting holographically

2293.2 --> 2295.7599999999998
everywhere

2296.8 --> 2301.44
because every siding of every celestial

2299.76 --> 2305.5200000000004
is

2301.44 --> 2306.4
unique you see it at the edge of your

2305.52 --> 2309.04
vision

2306.4 --> 2311.599
the virtual location angular virtual

2309.04 --> 2314.4
location

2311.599 --> 2315.599
no matter like if a few hundred miles

2314.4 --> 2318.1600000000003
away

2315.599 --> 2319.6800000000003
somebody else there will not see it on

2318.16 --> 2322.96
that same location they will have

2319.68 --> 2322.96
another angle to it

2324.0 --> 2327.28
right if you try to trace down the

2326.32 --> 2329.3590000000004
angles

2327.28 --> 2331.28
in euclidean space above the earth then

2329.359 --> 2333.2799999999997
it just all disappears

2331.28 --> 2335.44
there's nothing left there is no

2333.28 --> 2341.8390000000004
euclidean position from which these

2335.44 --> 2341.839
lights are coming

2346.079 --> 2350.0
firmament reflects like well there we

2347.76 --> 2351.119
have another rumor good server you don't

2350.0 --> 2355.839
know that

2351.119 --> 2355.839
at all

2359.44 --> 2363.2000000000003
the ferment would be reflecting like

2361.28 --> 2365.119
that would mean that you would see your

2363.2 --> 2369.68
own reflection

2365.119 --> 2371.839
good servant

2369.68 --> 2374.3999999999996
i could be reflecting that would

2371.839 --> 2377.599
literally mean

2374.4 --> 2380.64
you go up a certain height and you

2377.599 --> 2382.4
zoom in all the way up there you should

2380.64 --> 2385.52
be able to be

2382.4 --> 2389.28
seeing a reflection of yourself

2385.52 --> 2392.56
right it's a reflecting lights

2389.28 --> 2396.4
off the dome whatever it is that means

2392.56 --> 2398.7999999999997
it would also be reflecting you

2396.4 --> 2398.8
right

2400.16 --> 2411.839
natural consequences think about it

2421.76 --> 2426.5600000000004
okay george sanford thanks for that

2424.16 --> 2426.56
update

2427.76 --> 2439.8390000000004
that little factoid

2441.28 --> 2446.1600000000003
right well you know what one could even

2444.4 --> 2449.2000000000003
consider

2446.16 --> 2453.359
angles the idea of angles an

2449.2 --> 2456.0
early realization of holographic things

2453.359 --> 2457.359
might have been what people would start

2456.0 --> 2461.359
to call angels

2457.359 --> 2464.16
right maybe angels are

2461.359 --> 2464.16
originally

2465.52 --> 2470.16
like yeah that's why they called the

2468.24 --> 2471.839
stars angels right well maybe that's

2470.16 --> 2474.319
because they are elusive they

2471.839 --> 2475.599
are a holographic they appear to the

2474.319 --> 2478.319
individual

2475.599 --> 2478.96
yet they cannot be grasped sounds

2478.319 --> 2481.44
roughly

2478.96 --> 2483.359
also like early descriptions of angels

2481.44 --> 2488.88
in ways and

2483.359 --> 2488.88
divine phenomena wouldn't you say

2488.96 --> 2492.48
so yeah maybe the ancients simply

2491.839 --> 2496.0
thought that

2492.48 --> 2499.839
holographic things were divine because

2496.0 --> 2499.839
they just couldn't grasp it at all

2502.319 --> 2509.2799999999997
they responded all of them

2506.8 --> 2511.3590000000004
going into a little joke mode here like

2509.28 --> 2514.4
the average black men

2511.359 --> 2517.119
two street magician tricks

2514.4 --> 2518.96
they were all like what the [ __ ] and

2517.119 --> 2522.0
they just didn't know how to

2518.96 --> 2524.16
handle such realizations

2522.0 --> 2525.04
holographic things that were literally

2524.16 --> 2527.92
built in

2525.04 --> 2528.24
creation so they just thought uh that's

2527.92 --> 2530.64
just

2528.24 --> 2532.16
angels it's too complicated don't don't

2530.64 --> 2535.359
think about it

2532.16 --> 2536.72
scary like this god stuff right it's the

2535.359 --> 2540.0
angels

2536.72 --> 2543.5989999999997
right roughly

2540.0 --> 2543.599
comparing speculating

2545.52 --> 2551.68
because people usually end up fearing

2548.8 --> 2553.52
and sometimes even obsessing over what

2551.68 --> 2556.0
they don't understand

2553.52 --> 2557.599
that they attribute great powers to

2556.0 --> 2560.0
something

2557.599 --> 2560.88
because who knows it might be they don't

2560.0 --> 2565.839
understand so

2560.88 --> 2565.839
who knows what power it contains right

2566.8 --> 2581.2000000000003
human nature that does that

2579.2 --> 2583.839
water can reflect light without

2581.2 --> 2586.96
reflecting yourself

2583.839 --> 2590.0
that's if it's reflecting

2586.96 --> 2591.839
it's reflecting now if the light being

2590.0 --> 2595.68
reflected is very bright it will

2591.839 --> 2598.56
outshine every reflection yeah sure

2595.68 --> 2601.04
but if it's a mirror it's still going to

2598.56 --> 2603.04
mirror things

2601.04 --> 2605.44
and especially since you go up and the

2603.04 --> 2608.64
stars seem to disappear

2605.44 --> 2611.28
well what's stopping you from seeing a

2608.64 --> 2613.52
reflection of yourself then

2611.28 --> 2613.52
right

2614.88 --> 2618.48
if you're in a room of mirrors that's

2616.64 --> 2622.16
perfectly dark

2618.48 --> 2623.52
then you don't see anything light up one

2622.16 --> 2626.64
candle and you'll see

2623.52 --> 2632.079
yourself reflected everywhere

2626.64 --> 2632.0789999999997
where there's mirrors right that's a

2632.839 --> 2635.839
mirror

2636.64 --> 2642.0789999999997
now if there's very bright lamps

2639.76 --> 2643.8390000000004
like really bright lamps in those same

2642.079 --> 2646.319
mirror rooms

2643.839 --> 2647.44
shining everywhere yeah you're gonna see

2646.319 --> 2650.72
like bright [ __ ]

2647.44 --> 2654.4
everywhere probably and you won't so

2650.72 --> 2656.3999999999996
easily see your reflection

2654.4 --> 2657.599
it might be drowned out by the light

2656.4 --> 2660.1600000000003
right

2657.599 --> 2661.52
that's logical but if it's not there if

2660.16 --> 2663.52
there's no light

2661.52 --> 2666.24
then what's stopping you from seeing a

2663.52 --> 2677.839
reflection of yourself

2666.24 --> 2677.839
right this is my question to you

2683.28 --> 2687.119
perhaps they didn't understand holograms

2685.359 --> 2691.839
and yeah that was my point

2687.119 --> 2691.839
cool aboken that was exactly my point

2693.28 --> 2697.119
so yeah not surprising that they would

2695.76 --> 2700.3190000000004
end up

2697.119 --> 2702.4
calling them angels the stars they would

2700.319 --> 2704.0
always be around they will be mysterious

2702.4 --> 2706.64
they are ever out of reach but they're

2704.0 --> 2706.64
always there

2715.76 --> 2720.3190000000004
demons in the sky shine bright like what

2718.72 --> 2722.72
the [ __ ] are you talking about wire

2720.319 --> 2722.72
blues

2730.839 --> 2747.839
serious

2733.68 --> 2747.839
why do you bring demons into this

2758.839 --> 2761.839
so

2777.2 --> 2779.4399999999996
what

2782.079 --> 2788.4
lights are in the water or mirrors

2785.28 --> 2790.7200000000003
powered by salt water and i have

2788.4 --> 2792.7200000000003
no idea what you're talking about wire

2790.72 --> 2795.839
blues can you be

2792.72 --> 2795.839
a little bit more

2796.64 --> 2802.8799999999997
focused making a point

2799.92 --> 2804.48
this is not just like art school where

2802.88 --> 2807.52
i'm okay with you just

2804.48 --> 2810.56
randomly blabbering weird [ __ ]

2807.52 --> 2813.359
right no if you're gonna use words

2810.56 --> 2814.0
i'm going to demand a certain level of

2813.359 --> 2816.72
physics

2814.0 --> 2817.599
construction okay you're gonna have to

2816.72 --> 2820.8799999999997
be

2817.599 --> 2825.2000000000003
clear have a point please

2820.88 --> 2829.52
right what that guy did yesterday

2825.2 --> 2832.48
arataza rathazala i don't like that

2829.52 --> 2833.839
right he was just blabbering like a

2832.48 --> 2837.2
weirdo priest on a

2833.839 --> 2839.2799999999997
on a soapbox nine

2837.2 --> 2840.24
lit it's art type of blabber i don't

2839.28 --> 2843.119
like that

2840.24 --> 2845.359
and i don't give a [ __ ] about freaking

2843.119 --> 2849.119
songs

2845.359 --> 2852.319
by stupid pop stars okay don't

2849.119 --> 2856.079
drag that garbage in here

2852.319 --> 2859.68
thanks if you even

2856.079 --> 2862.96
know those songs you got a problem

2859.68 --> 2866.24
you got a mark on you why the hell did

2862.96 --> 2866.2400000000002
you watch that garbage

2866.96 --> 2875.28
it's all pure brainwashing pure

2871.52 --> 2878.079
darkness eating right all they do

2875.28 --> 2879.119
take in real interesting things and

2878.079 --> 2881.76
unique

2879.119 --> 2883.28
terrestrial phenomena whatever

2881.76 --> 2886.3190000000004
fantastical things

2883.28 --> 2890.3190000000004
and then put demon marks on it

2886.319 --> 2901.839
that's what they all do if you watch it

2890.319 --> 2901.839
you get contaminated

2931.599 --> 2939.599
yeah that's cool magnetic salt water

2935.52 --> 2939.599
is electric no not really

2941.839 --> 2946.0
might be the influence on

2946.24 --> 2952.319
on say the tide effects right salt water

2950.16 --> 2953.5989999999997
magnetics might be an electrical

2952.319 --> 2956.72
influence what i call

2953.599 --> 2958.6400000000003
angel spoons right that's serious

2956.72 --> 2960.8799999999997
that's the name i'm going for right

2958.64 --> 2964.16
that's official

2960.88 --> 2966.079
physicality assumption bias optical

2964.16 --> 2969.5989999999997
slant

2966.079 --> 2970.079
angel spoon yeah it's literally what i'm

2969.599 --> 2972.2400000000002
calling

2970.079 --> 2972.2400000000002
it

2976.96 --> 2980.319
why do i call it that even because i

2978.88 --> 2983.44
think that it's probably

2980.319 --> 2986.8
part of the same influence

2983.44 --> 2999.839
same energy source that helps manifest

2986.8 --> 2999.8390000000004
the heavenly lights

3006.88 --> 3010.7200000000003
crucify means increase

3011.2 --> 3015.2799999999997
that's a very old terminology then

3024.319 --> 3028.48
i get it like day mom

3030.48 --> 3038.48
mon being me

3033.599 --> 3038.48
day is that true okay could be

3039.359 --> 3043.04
right but that's the problem that's the

3040.88 --> 3046.0
cultural problem we all have

3043.04 --> 3047.599
right it's all the same roots of the

3046.0 --> 3051.44
language and then people

3047.599 --> 3051.44
start saying okay

3051.52 --> 3059.7599999999998
let's graph this icon

3055.68 --> 3061.5989999999997
into regular language

3059.76 --> 3064.3190000000004
let's make this out of it let's make

3061.599 --> 3064.319
that out of it

3065.359 --> 3071.119
so they well they literally demonize

3068.64 --> 3072.4
the language even the word demonized

3071.119 --> 3076.079
basically have come

3072.4 --> 3077.6800000000003
out of it demonizing by what you said

3076.079 --> 3083.04
seeking star wars

3077.68 --> 3086.24
is shaming somebody for really ascending

3083.04 --> 3087.7599999999998
for being their true self and not being

3086.24 --> 3092.16
part of a system

3087.76 --> 3092.1600000000003
that's really weird demonize

3093.119 --> 3098.48
to basically shame someone's true self

3096.4 --> 3101.28
that's yeah it's kind of mind blown when

3098.48 --> 3101.28
you think about it

3103.92 --> 3110.88
in that sense even the word demon itself

3106.96 --> 3115.04
is demonizing to the true self it's

3110.88 --> 3115.04
using the word demonize is to

3119.04 --> 3125.839
deny individuality

3137.119 --> 3140.8
i don't really understand how crucify

3139.599 --> 3143.599
really ties into

3140.8 --> 3143.599
increase though

3150.64 --> 3153.839
like how would it amplify

3155.599 --> 3161.2000000000003
how does a cross increase i

3159.28 --> 3162.48
i don't really see the connection with

3161.2 --> 3167.839
that one yet but

3162.48 --> 3167.839
might come to me let's look it up

3170.16 --> 3173.42
[Applause]

3187.92 --> 3195.839
right well when you look it up it

3189.839 --> 3195.839
doesn't really yield the other version

3200.079 --> 3208.319
yeah crucifying is relentlessly

3205.2 --> 3210.0789999999997
criticizing and indeed the literal thing

3208.319 --> 3213.7599999999998
so

3210.079 --> 3213.76
don't even know where you got that root

3220.839 --> 3223.839
from

3234.839 --> 3237.839
so

3269.76 --> 3274.8
i'd be interested to see

3272.8 --> 3276.8390000000004
where you got that connection from

3274.8 --> 3281.2000000000003
specifically

3276.839 --> 3282.88
because i'm not finding any sort of

3281.2 --> 3287.7599999999998
reference of that what you said

3282.88 --> 3287.76
about crucify seeking star water

3289.359 --> 3293.7599999999998
i mean with dam on i could simply derive

3292.64 --> 3296.48
it from

3293.76 --> 3296.48
the latin

3297.92 --> 3307.28
just get literal with the words but

3302.24 --> 3311.68
crucify i can't find that

3307.28 --> 3321.8390000000004
it is an esoteric hermetic definition

3311.68 --> 3321.839
what okay

3322.559 --> 3329.76
well maybe they interpret it then

3325.599 --> 3333.839
as like a martyr effect

3329.76 --> 3336.88
if crucifying is one would you say again

3333.839 --> 3338.72
increase then maybe it is like yeah if

3336.88 --> 3342.319
you crucify something

3338.72 --> 3344.5589999999997
its message will be increased like that

3342.319 --> 3345.92
so it's rather than the increase is

3344.559 --> 3347.92
through martyrdom

3345.92 --> 3363.839
or something i don't know i'm trying to

3347.92 --> 3363.839
connect it here

3363.92 --> 3369.2000000000003
that connection would be well typically

3366.16 --> 3369.2
like esoteric

3374.319 --> 3378.96
but it would rather be like the

3376.16 --> 3378.96
consequence

3385.76 --> 3389.44
not the action so it would be pointing

3387.599 --> 3392.4
at the consequence of the action not the

3389.44 --> 3392.4
action itself

3393.04 --> 3405.839
i don't know

3413.04 --> 3418.16
waters above waters below no no there is

3416.079 --> 3419.6800000000003
no clue of that whatsoever and there's

3418.16 --> 3421.839
no holes

3419.68 --> 3424.319
dude i already addressed it the holes in

3421.839 --> 3426.88
the firmament no there is no holes

3424.319 --> 3428.5589999999997
there is a reference though and neil at

3426.88 --> 3432.4
the flat earth debates love to

3428.559 --> 3436.1600000000003
remind us about it that the

3432.4 --> 3440.0
celestial lights the luminaries

3436.16 --> 3443.44
are in the firmament yeah that's not

3440.0 --> 3446.88
holes no it's in the firmament

3443.44 --> 3450.2400000000002
right let's get let's just

3446.88 --> 3453.6800000000003
like now in can also mean out

3450.24 --> 3457.1189999999997
or in between no no in means

3453.68 --> 3461.44
in all right in

3457.119 --> 3464.48
firmament however you think it is in

3461.44 --> 3467.599
not under not through

3464.48 --> 3470.64
in in in in not

3467.599 --> 3474.0
anywhere else right so

3470.64 --> 3476.72
drop the holes idea it doesn't exist

3474.0 --> 3476.72
there's no way

3477.52 --> 3484.96
so yeah if you say it's in the firmament

3481.04 --> 3488.079
then maybe the firmament is like a glass

3484.96 --> 3490.079
holographic system that literally

3488.079 --> 3491.3590000000004
through however the [ __ ] that's supposed

3490.079 --> 3494.1600000000003
to work

3491.359 --> 3497.2
managed to create a hologram that is

3494.16 --> 3500.0
visible to everybody

3497.2 --> 3500.319
even though your site might not be able

3500.0 --> 3503.2
to

3500.319 --> 3504.4
bridge the distance towards the

3503.2 --> 3507.52
firmament

3504.4 --> 3507.52
the physical thing

3511.92 --> 3515.04
right that's the only thing that's said

3513.52 --> 3517.92
about it right and it's a

3515.04 --> 3518.799
massive clue and it excludes so many

3517.92 --> 3522.4
things

3518.799 --> 3522.4
when you realize that hm

3526.48 --> 3534.0
in is in just like and

3530.559 --> 3537.0400000000004
means and and not also or

3534.0 --> 3539.44
it means and not or right in

3537.04 --> 3540.079
means in if it's in the firmament it's

3539.44 --> 3543.2000000000003
in

3540.079 --> 3544.079
the firmament not in between the

3543.2 --> 3546.319
firmament

3544.079 --> 3548.079
not through the firmament not under the

3546.319 --> 3551.68
fermi not above the ferment

3548.079 --> 3551.6800000000003
in the firmament

3557.359 --> 3561.119
right and hey if there is a holographic

3559.76 --> 3564.4
thing coming

3561.119 --> 3567.76
from something an object

3564.4 --> 3571.44
then yeah where's the hologram it's

3567.76 --> 3572.0
in the object because it isn't anywhere

3571.44 --> 3574.799
it's not

3572.0 --> 3575.839
literally anywhere the object that has a

3574.799 --> 3579.04
has a hologram

3575.839 --> 3583.2
thing going yeah the hologram is

3579.04 --> 3584.88
in the object not behind the object not

3583.2 --> 3586.319
in front of the object not in between

3584.88 --> 3588.559
the object no it's in

3586.319 --> 3589.7599999999998
the object the object creates the

3588.559 --> 3593.3590000000004
hologram

3589.76 --> 3601.8390000000004
to the observer within right

3593.359 --> 3601.839
that's how it works

3605.52 --> 3611.04
oh finally

3609.28 --> 3613.2000000000003
the sun stopped hitting the wall here

3611.04 --> 3615.599
that's good

3613.2 --> 3617.1189999999997
i need to get a little breather it's so

3615.599 --> 3620.319
hot

3617.119 --> 3620.319
hey julio pop on

3620.64 --> 3623.04
sup

3626.839 --> 3632.0
huh

3629.68 --> 3633.04
behind the ocean there must be a way out

3632.0 --> 3634.96
into it as well

3633.04 --> 3637.359
hey if you really want to go there why

3634.96 --> 3643.839
don't you try and find out

3637.359 --> 3643.839
right or you could just live your life

3649.2 --> 3653.7599999999998
crap it's even more hot outside than

3651.359 --> 3653.7599999999998
it's here

3654.839 --> 3657.839
ah

3672.4 --> 3675.6800000000003
okay seeking star wars well by that

3674.559 --> 3678.88
definition

3675.68 --> 3682.5589999999997
it seems like crucify is

3678.88 --> 3682.559
synonymous for rebirth

3682.88 --> 3689.28
that's that's occultism though

3686.799 --> 3691.2
because how does that have anything

3689.28 --> 3694.6400000000003
remotely to do with

3691.2 --> 3696.72
it's just a description explaining

3694.64 --> 3699.2
esoterics and then say yeah you can use

3696.72 --> 3702.24
it that way that's a priest trick

3699.2 --> 3705.2
that's that's literally

3702.24 --> 3705.2
the gnostics

3706.0 --> 3709.52
using their esoteric thinking where is

3708.48 --> 3711.44
their mind at

3709.52 --> 3713.92
and then saying okay we're just going to

3711.44 --> 3716.88
use this word

3713.92 --> 3718.48
for our ritualistic esoteric

3716.88 --> 3720.319
understanding even though the word

3718.48 --> 3721.76
really hasn't anything to do with it

3720.319 --> 3725.0389999999998
it's more symbolic

3721.76 --> 3727.8390000000004
right so yeah i personally

3725.039 --> 3727.8390000000004
disapprove

3729.599 --> 3734.6400000000003
it's it's a priest thing has nothing to

3732.799 --> 3736.64
do with the real word

3734.64 --> 3738.24
like with demon yeah you could

3736.64 --> 3741.839
definitely

3738.24 --> 3745.2799999999997
consider that

3741.839 --> 3747.92
it's complicated crucify no

3745.28 --> 3749.599
crucified means crucify it doesn't mean

3747.92 --> 3752.7200000000003
ascend

3749.599 --> 3753.2000000000003
does it mean rebirth you could attribute

3752.72 --> 3756.8799999999997
those

3753.2 --> 3759.1189999999997
things to it in a very specific context

3756.88 --> 3769.839
but that's not the universal meaning of

3759.119 --> 3769.839
it it's just not

3794.24 --> 3798.799
in heaven on earth that's interesting

3798.88 --> 3806.1600000000003
but is heaven the firmament agm

3802.64 --> 3811.839
would be in heaven would that equate

3806.16 --> 3811.839
in the firmament would it

3812.079 --> 3815.3590000000004
because by that standard that saying

3814.079 --> 3819.2000000000003
would basically

3815.359 --> 3820.64
point at astrology that would be saying

3819.2 --> 3823.1189999999997
okay yeah the lights

3820.64 --> 3824.8799999999997
in the heavens the assumed angels

3823.119 --> 3828.4
whatever or in the firmament

3824.88 --> 3829.2000000000003
yeah what they do reflects directly on

3828.4 --> 3832.4
earth

3829.2 --> 3834.799
and that's what astrologers go with

3832.4 --> 3836.799
because it kind of is an influence to

3834.799 --> 3839.2
the celestials on earth

3836.799 --> 3841.359
it's kind of elusive it's bizarre how it

3839.2 --> 3842.48
works has to do with the energy swings

3841.359 --> 3844.0789999999997
and all that

3842.48 --> 3847.359
probably the same thing that actually

3844.079 --> 3847.3590000000004
feeds their manifestation

3847.68 --> 3850.5589999999997
three heavens

3851.599 --> 3858.0
does that mean three firmament layers

3855.28 --> 3858.0
with their own

3858.559 --> 3862.1600000000003
holographic elements

3862.4 --> 3866.079
because yeah it's it's simple what are

3865.2 --> 3868.72
you actually

3866.079 --> 3868.7200000000003
interpreting

3870.88 --> 3876.1600000000003
because in my opinion seriously guys

3873.599 --> 3878.0
heaven what you think is heaven

3876.16 --> 3880.48
i don't think that's a literal physical

3878.0 --> 3882.559
place i don't think heaven exists in the

3880.48 --> 3885.119
material realm i think it is an over

3882.559 --> 3885.119
dimension

3888.16 --> 3890.48
and

3891.839 --> 3896.72
right i think there might be like this

3894.44 --> 3899.76
intertwining

3896.72 --> 3903.9199999999996
of celestial lore and

3899.76 --> 3905.76
holographics in that sense and

3903.92 --> 3907.359
heaven and the angels in the other

3905.76 --> 3910.7990000000004
dimension of the spirit

3907.359 --> 3911.5989999999997
right i think there seems to be a mix-up

3910.799 --> 3922.48
in it

3911.599 --> 3924.2400000000002
a lot of people mix this up constantly

3922.48 --> 3926.4
oh my god they already depleted that

3924.24 --> 3928.9599999999996
water within an hour

3926.4 --> 3928.96
two hours

3932.4 --> 3937.359
astrology is for the simple-minded oh

3936.16 --> 3938.7799999999997
really

3937.359 --> 3941.7599999999998
is it now

3938.78 --> 3944.4
[Music]

3941.76 --> 3944.4
no it's not

3948.0 --> 3953.119
but hey the simpleminded can be seduced

3951.119 --> 3954.96
to basically become an addict to

3953.119 --> 3956.4
astrology readings

3954.96 --> 3958.16
right which means that they would

3956.4 --> 3962.319
abandon their natural

3958.16 --> 3964.96
inner understanding and reading

3962.319 --> 3966.72
in favor of oh i need the input from

3964.96 --> 3968.96
outside

3966.72 --> 3968.9599999999996
right

3970.4 --> 3975.76
that's simple-minded you become addicted

3973.359 --> 3979.119
to astrology and you constantly try to

3975.76 --> 3980.0
find things to believe within it instead

3979.119 --> 3984.0
of

3980.0 --> 3986.559
realizing the deeper connections

3984.0 --> 3987.599
because i even had look i all forms of

3986.559 --> 3991.119
divination

3987.599 --> 3994.319
yield pretty heavy results with me like

3991.119 --> 3996.48
seriously heavy like

3994.319 --> 4000.16
i talk about fractal thinking well when

3996.48 --> 4002.72
freaking somebody lays a card for me

4000.16 --> 4003.359
in a non-hostile attempt an actual

4002.72 --> 4006.48
connection

4003.359 --> 4008.0
spiritual person to person things come

4006.48 --> 4011.119
rolling out there that just

4008.0 --> 4012.0
absolutely blow my mind right and now

4011.119 --> 4015.359
we're talking about

4012.0 --> 4018.72
our winds mind not easily blown

4015.359 --> 4022.0789999999997
okay you can't blow my mind that easily

4018.72 --> 4023.7599999999998
and it does it every freaking time

4022.079 --> 4025.2000000000003
it freaks me out sometimes that's why i

4023.76 --> 4027.5200000000004
don't do it all the time

4025.2 --> 4029.2
because it makes too much impact right

4027.52 --> 4031.92
astrology is not

4029.2 --> 4034.64
for the simple-minded definition is not

4031.92 --> 4036.799
for the simple-minded

4034.64 --> 4038.72
but the simple-minded might simply

4036.799 --> 4042.24
abandon

4038.72 --> 4043.5989999999997
a sensible course of being and thinking

4042.24 --> 4045.9199999999996
for themselves and

4043.599 --> 4049.039
trying to take responsibility figure out

4045.92 --> 4052.48
things out there and

4049.039 --> 4055.5200000000004
reaching out to god in favor of

4052.48 --> 4056.72
constantly feeding on readouts of

4055.52 --> 4059.359
astrologers

4056.72 --> 4061.7599999999998
right that's simple-minded not because

4059.359 --> 4062.4
the astrology is simple-minded it's

4061.76 --> 4064.88
because the

4062.4 --> 4064.88
people

4065.599 --> 4071.52
latch onto it because they don't get a

4068.96 --> 4077.839
grip on their own life

4071.52 --> 4077.839
those are the simple-minded

4099.759 --> 4105.679
writing a book on interest well seeking

4102.799 --> 4109.759
star wars

4105.679 --> 4111.759
yes i am kind of ignoring it

4109.759 --> 4112.96
because i take it very seriously it

4111.759 --> 4115.04
sounds weird right

4112.96 --> 4116.4
i ignore it because i take it very

4115.04 --> 4119.679
serious like i don't

4116.4 --> 4123.2789999999995
want to be like i have like tarot

4119.679 --> 4127.679
type cards i have them here

4123.279 --> 4127.679
i haven't touched them in over a year

4128.0 --> 4132.0
and i don't allow myself to be drawn to

4130.96 --> 4134.96
using it regularly

4132.0 --> 4136.319
i don't do that anymore because it's

4134.96 --> 4137.92
only going to be a burden and

4136.319 --> 4142.4800000000005
distraction to me

4137.92 --> 4147.6
but i would like to know

4142.48 --> 4150.4
more about your deck in the book

4147.6 --> 4152.2390000000005
and well if you would i would love to

4150.4 --> 4154.4
have a copy of it

4152.239 --> 4156.0
once you're finished and i will be

4154.4 --> 4161.839
giving that copy

4156.0 --> 4161.839
to my mother-in-law

4162.239 --> 4168.799
right to my dad's wife because she is

4165.359 --> 4171.1990000000005
really strong with astrology like really

4168.799 --> 4171.199
strong

4171.279 --> 4175.839000000001
and i'd love to hear her opinion

4175.92 --> 4189.839
on your work

4200.64 --> 4203.92
that's not my mother-in-law oh sorry uh

4202.719 --> 4207.28
stepmother

4203.92 --> 4209.679
mother-in-law the [ __ ] no mother-in-law

4207.28 --> 4209.679
would be

4211.199 --> 4214.4
like the mother of my brother's wife

4214.0 --> 4216.96
right

4214.4 --> 4218.879999999999
yeah i'm sorry stepmother this is the

4216.96 --> 4222.08
mother-in-law

4218.88 --> 4225.52
weird thanks

4222.08 --> 4231.84
yeah that's not my mother-in-law i know

4225.52 --> 4231.84
i can make mistakes

4237.84 --> 4240.159000000001
don't

4241.36 --> 4245.599999999999
know agm astrology is not horoscope

4244.08 --> 4248.08
nonsense

4245.6 --> 4248.08
it isn't

4248.719 --> 4255.36
but you should not be afraid of

4252.159 --> 4258.4
not wanting to engage with it just don't

4255.36 --> 4260.0
poopoo it when you do right when you

4258.4 --> 4263.839999999999
step away from astrology

4260.0 --> 4265.92
don't be a dick towards people

4263.84 --> 4267.360000000001
that actually know something about that

4265.92 --> 4269.92
all right don't do it

4267.36 --> 4271.04
don't get always if the devil is at the

4269.92 --> 4274.2390000000005
table

4271.04 --> 4277.28
yeah don't be a [ __ ] about it

4274.239 --> 4280.5599999999995
just eat the warnings and even my

4277.28 --> 4284.0
warnings that i literally just now roll

4280.56 --> 4284.0
out for everybody to hear

4284.84 --> 4289.12
right i personally don't even tap into

4288.159 --> 4292.5599999999995
astrology

4289.12 --> 4294.08
why because i take it very seriously and

4292.56 --> 4297.679
i know

4294.08 --> 4302.32
that the serious power of it could

4297.679 --> 4308.64
lead me away from my own pure focus

4302.32 --> 4315.84
that's why not because it's mumbo jumbo

4308.64 --> 4315.84
or because it's evil no it's not

4333.679 --> 4343.84
damn it come here

4344.0 --> 4348.4
no you're not in the wrong chat seeking

4345.76 --> 4348.400000000001
star wars

4349.84 --> 4353.76
there are some obstacles with some

4352.56 --> 4356.8
people

4353.76 --> 4358.719
that need to be worked through

4356.8 --> 4361.1990000000005
but hey what i'm saying is also a

4358.719 --> 4365.92
message to you you know

4361.199 --> 4365.919999999999
be careful be careful with it don't

4368.32 --> 4375.199
never stop relying on yourself

4371.44 --> 4378.48
right if you grow to need

4375.199 --> 4379.5199999999995
an astrology reference some sort any

4378.48 --> 4381.28
sort

4379.52 --> 4385.84
when you actually engage with your own

4381.28 --> 4385.84
life you got a problem

4387.84 --> 4394.88
in in any form i see astrology as

4391.52 --> 4397.84
it's a look beyond

4394.88 --> 4398.64
beyond your normal flow so i can

4397.84 --> 4401.679
literally just

4398.64 --> 4404.8
open the the window

4401.679 --> 4405.52
to astrology get a read and just be

4404.8 --> 4408.400000000001
absolutely like

4405.52 --> 4410.0
holy [ __ ] i knew it i know it i know it

4408.4 --> 4414.0
then it close it back down

4410.0 --> 4415.52
say i forget about it it is as i thought

4414.0 --> 4418.96
it was and i don't

4415.52 --> 4422.159000000001
need that constant glory power

4418.96 --> 4425.36
because it will rip

4422.159 --> 4427.599999999999
you away from

4425.36 --> 4429.28
the flow you're actually in it's like

4427.6 --> 4433.280000000001
opening the door eventually

4429.28 --> 4435.28
ruins the effect don't don't open it up

4433.28 --> 4438.88
and keep it open forever

4435.28 --> 4438.88
because it'll ruin everything

4439.199 --> 4444.639999999999
that's how i use it only

4442.32 --> 4446.5599999999995
open up a window to basically find a

4444.64 --> 4448.88
confirmation that everything i thought

4446.56 --> 4451.679
was correct

4448.88 --> 4453.04
and then it turns out to be because i

4451.679 --> 4457.12
don't really make

4453.04 --> 4457.12
that many long-term mistakes anymore

4457.36 --> 4463.679
even in my thoughts my

4460.56 --> 4466.96
feelings are extremely sharp

4463.679 --> 4466.96
extremely sharp

4467.52 --> 4472.159000000001
i pick up on more things with my

4470.48 --> 4475.28
feelings and my intuition

4472.159 --> 4478.639999999999
then i can cognitively understand

4475.28 --> 4482.239
and i have had that for decades

4478.64 --> 4485.12
pretty much my entire life and i still

4482.239 --> 4486.159
esoterically reflect upon those moments

4485.12 --> 4490.0
that i did not

4486.159 --> 4491.199
understand what i read still do that

4490.0 --> 4495.44
because i believe

4491.199 --> 4500.719
that one day i will get a complete

4495.44 --> 4500.719
conscious grip on everything i've ever

4508.84 --> 4511.84
perceived

4527.199 --> 4539.839999999999
what looking up at the stars worshiping

4530.48 --> 4539.839999999999
devils were you talking about

4540.32 --> 4545.12
why do you think ancient civilizations

4542.4 --> 4548.639999999999
mapped the heavens before the earth

4545.12 --> 4552.4
uh that's very easy

4548.64 --> 4555.84
to explain arataza dattazala very easy

4552.4 --> 4555.839999999999
why do you think they did that

4556.64 --> 4564.4800000000005
because the heavens are like a sphere

4560.88 --> 4568.64
and they have a very specific limit

4564.48 --> 4572.159
limit of amount of celestial sightings

4568.64 --> 4575.1990000000005
right also you can see the major

4572.159 --> 4578.0
part of the celestial heavens and how it

4575.199 --> 4581.44
is like in relation to everything else

4578.0 --> 4584.4
pretty much everywhere

4581.44 --> 4585.5199999999995
the actual land on earth now that's

4584.4 --> 4589.5199999999995
another matter

4585.52 --> 4592.080000000001
that's not so easy to just go everywhere

4589.52 --> 4593.679
right because you might run into hostile

4592.08 --> 4596.48
opponents

4593.679 --> 4599.28
or extremely harsh nature that you're

4596.48 --> 4602.32
not really prepared for yeah it's

4599.28 --> 4602.96
endlessly more complicated to map the

4602.32 --> 4606.08
earth

4602.96 --> 4608.159
than it is to map the heavens so of

4606.08 --> 4623.84
course they map the heavens first

4608.159 --> 4623.839999999999
of course they did it's only logical

4646.239 --> 4651.839999999999
uh yeah agm that doesn't really mean

4648.8 --> 4651.84
anything to me

4657.6 --> 4661.52
maybe other people here understand

4659.6 --> 4663.84
exactly what you mean with that i have

4661.52 --> 4665.52
no freaking idea and i will never have

4663.84 --> 4669.28
an idea right

4665.52 --> 4671.92
i will never in my lifetime be a person

4669.28 --> 4671.92
that'll hear

4673.12 --> 4681.04
wobbly [ __ ] 12 5

4676.4 --> 4683.759999999999
8 and then actually know what that means

4681.04 --> 4685.44
maybe in like 40 years or something if

4683.76 --> 4687.1990000000005
i'm still alive i will have

4685.44 --> 4689.04
heard it so many times that i will

4687.199 --> 4690.799999999999
eventually start to associate

4689.04 --> 4693.92
what i learned about it afterward with

4690.8 --> 4696.320000000001
what it means and then maybe

4693.92 --> 4697.36
i'll never be good at it so yeah if

4696.32 --> 4701.12
you're just gonna say

4697.36 --> 4703.28
luke 8 17 that literally doesn't mean

4701.12 --> 4705.44
anything to me

4703.28 --> 4707.04
so unless you're actually gonna say what

4705.44 --> 4710.4
it says

4707.04 --> 4721.84
there's no point to me in doing that in

4710.4 --> 4721.839999999999
my chat agm

4725.199 --> 4732.32
numerology is very important why

4729.12 --> 4732.32
why is it important

4732.48 --> 4735.839999999999
i disagree

4738.56 --> 4742.56
i mean yeah you can use it sure and hey

4741.44 --> 4746.239
numerology is a

4742.56 --> 4746.2390000000005
naturally arrived thing

4746.32 --> 4750.96
so yeah people will have done stuff with

4748.8 --> 4750.96
it

4751.92 --> 4763.84
how does that make it important

4774.84 --> 4777.84
uh

4788.84 --> 4796.400000000001
okay

4791.44 --> 4800.799999999999
yeah i know so do i and you know why

4796.4 --> 4805.12
because i exclude number relations right

4800.8 --> 4806.4800000000005
in all the web interdimensional web of

4805.12 --> 4808.32
correlations of

4806.48 --> 4810.638999999999
everything with everything right

4808.32 --> 4814.0
everything with everything

4810.639 --> 4819.84
multiple dimensions right freaking

4814.0 --> 4823.28
numbers is like duplo

4819.84 --> 4826.639
to heavy mechanical legos it's

4823.28 --> 4827.5199999999995
useless it's so primitive yeah it works

4826.639 --> 4832.719
out but

4827.52 --> 4836.080000000001
what are you gonna do with it nothing

4832.719 --> 4838.159
the true web of of connections of

4836.08 --> 4840.8
all meaning and all things with all

4838.159 --> 4843.759999999999
things is much more extensive than just

4840.8 --> 4843.76
numerology

4843.84 --> 4847.92
right just like gematria it's a

4846.239 --> 4850.959999999999
distraction it's

4847.92 --> 4855.12
it's just gonna rip you away

4850.96 --> 4857.92
from clarity stillness

4855.12 --> 4858.4
and unique insight that's what i've seen

4857.92 --> 4861.84
it do

4858.4 --> 4861.839999999999
and that's why i avoid it

4862.639 --> 4868.719
yeah numerology is like duplo blocks

4865.92 --> 4870.96
compared to technical legos right the

4868.719 --> 4870.96
real

4873.76 --> 4877.84
the good stuff you can build machines

4876.96 --> 4882.0
with legos

4877.84 --> 4882.96
right yeah so what can you do with duplo

4882.0 --> 4888.159
box

4882.96 --> 4891.36
nothing can build a wall with it

4888.159 --> 4894.48
or a tower or a mountain

4891.36 --> 4894.48
that's pretty much it

4894.8 --> 4898.4800000000005
technical i don't know what it's called

4896.48 --> 4902.239
meccano legos

4898.48 --> 4906.239
it's just another type of lego

4902.239 --> 4908.4
a lot of axes and and gears and [ __ ]

4906.239 --> 4911.919999999999
and you have like motors electro motors

4908.4 --> 4911.92
with them i still have some of that

4913.679 --> 4917.52
but the main difference is that yeah

4915.679 --> 4921.04
duplos has just the

4917.52 --> 4923.1990000000005
extreme limit to what type of blocks

4921.04 --> 4925.44
it has available while technical lagos

4923.199 --> 4928.0
has like

4925.44 --> 4930.32
thousands if not tens of thousands

4928.0 --> 4933.76
different types of parts

4930.32 --> 4935.44
right you could do endless endlessly

4933.76 --> 4936.719
more things with technical legos that

4935.44 --> 4938.32
you could do with duplos

4936.719 --> 4945.84
that was kind of the point i was trying

4938.32 --> 4945.84
to make

4950.8 --> 4956.400000000001
right and by the way it's more about

4952.56 --> 4956.400000000001
geometry than numerology

4956.639 --> 4960.96
there is probably more value hidden

4959.12 --> 4962.88
within numerology

4960.96 --> 4964.719
but just like with all serious

4962.88 --> 4968.2390000000005
divinations i like to just

4964.719 --> 4968.2390000000005
put it in the back

4969.04 --> 4975.44
because it will eat you up alive it will

4972.56 --> 4976.639
eat your consciousness up if especially

4975.44 --> 4979.839999999999
if it's strong it will

4976.639 --> 4983.28
literally consume

4979.84 --> 4984.96
your soul permanently right and that

4983.28 --> 4987.159
doesn't mean like oh you're going to

4984.96 --> 4992.32
hell now no it means you will be

4987.159 --> 5001.839999999999
permanently distracted permanently

4992.32 --> 5001.84
distracted yeah don't want that

5005.04 --> 5008.88
that's what it'll do to me now you out

5008.0 --> 5011.52
there may not

5008.88 --> 5011.92
experience anything like that i think

5011.52 --> 5014.2390000000005
and

5011.92 --> 5015.1990000000005
it's probably a rule fits the stronger

5014.239 --> 5017.12
the readouts

5015.199 --> 5019.44
the more dangerous they become to the

5017.12 --> 5023.04
recipient

5019.44 --> 5024.799999999999
it's like the difference between frodo

5023.04 --> 5026.48
taking the one ring and putting it on

5024.8 --> 5029.360000000001
becoming invisible

5026.48 --> 5030.239
getting some weird [ __ ] with it and

5029.36 --> 5034.4
somebody like

5030.239 --> 5034.4
gandalf putting it on right

5034.88 --> 5041.6
appeals to him a whole lot

5038.48 --> 5045.44
but through him

5041.6 --> 5048.639
the ring would wield terrible power

5045.44 --> 5052.5599999999995
right it feels like that to me

5048.639 --> 5054.96
that's exactly how it feels to me

5052.56 --> 5056.2390000000005
with astrology and numerology and all

5054.96 --> 5059.92
that it's like i

5056.239 --> 5061.36
understand the power i'm not going to

5059.92 --> 5062.88
assimilate it

5061.36 --> 5065.12
because it's going to end up

5062.88 --> 5068.159000000001
assimilating me

5065.12 --> 5071.84
and i don't want that i don't want to

5068.159 --> 5071.839999999999
become that

5086.719 --> 5091.36
those who choose numerology for evil

5089.12 --> 5091.36
what

5093.6 --> 5098.639
well look any form of manipulation

5096.159 --> 5101.92
whether it is through numbers

5098.639 --> 5104.88
or through dreams

5101.92 --> 5107.52
evil is evil doesn't matter what route

5104.88 --> 5110.2390000000005
it takes but if you're going to

5107.52 --> 5112.080000000001
attain power over a region like

5110.239 --> 5115.44
numerology or astrology

5112.08 --> 5118.5599999999995
or tarot cards

5115.44 --> 5119.599999999999
and then you use your insight over that

5118.56 --> 5122.96
power

5119.6 --> 5125.84
to mislead somebody do evil

5122.96 --> 5128.2390000000005
yeah that's gonna fire back at you

5125.84 --> 5130.8
because you wielded the power

5128.239 --> 5131.839999999999
and then you abused the power and then

5130.8 --> 5136.719
the punishment

5131.84 --> 5140.0
from god will come through the power

5136.719 --> 5143.04
you must realize this

5140.0 --> 5146.159
the more power you attain

5143.04 --> 5149.44
if you abuse that power then that power

5146.159 --> 5149.44
will be the punishment

5152.84 --> 5155.84
eventually

5157.679 --> 5160.88
the wabulants i don't know how that is

5159.76 --> 5163.360000000001
wisdom

5160.88 --> 5164.159000000001
i think that's called a trope something

5163.36 --> 5167.199
that people

5164.159 --> 5168.879999999999
endlessly parrot for all eternity not

5167.199 --> 5183.839999999999
knowing what the hell it even supposed

5168.88 --> 5183.84
to mean

5187.12 --> 5191.12
what is knowledge if you can apply it

5195.6 --> 5200.56
just knowledge right but just because

5198.48 --> 5203.759999999999
you know how to do something doesn't

5200.56 --> 5203.76
mean you should do it

5203.92 --> 5208.84
have you ever thought about that one

5205.679 --> 5211.84
arataza rathazala

5208.84 --> 5211.84
right

5215.52 --> 5225.84
just because you have power doesn't mean

5220.159 --> 5225.839999999999
you should use it

5236.84 --> 5239.84
okay

5253.679 --> 5260.2390000000005
but yeah look applying knowledge

5256.719 --> 5261.84
is complicated but if you apply to

5260.239 --> 5266.718999999999
yourself

5261.84 --> 5281.84
and yeah

5266.719 --> 5281.84
it's it's too complicated

5284.4 --> 5289.12
yes tara 306 indeed they use the great

5287.36 --> 5293.599999999999
distraction

5289.12 --> 5293.599999999999
to ignore their life that's what it is

5293.679 --> 5296.96
any great distraction will eventually

5296.32 --> 5301.04
serve to

5296.96 --> 5303.52
make you ignore your own life

5301.04 --> 5307.36
and that includes obsession with

5303.52 --> 5310.88
astrology and the tarot and all that

5307.36 --> 5311.679
get really good at it get obsessed with

5310.88 --> 5315.6
it

5311.679 --> 5319.52
any obsession will always make you

5315.6 --> 5323.84
draw away from your life's path

5319.52 --> 5323.84
it's what obsessions do

5323.92 --> 5329.4400000000005
sessions force you to change railroad it

5326.719 --> 5329.44
forces you

5330.4 --> 5333.759999999999
but it doesn't mean it's going to lead

5331.679 --> 5334.719
to something good that all depends on

5333.76 --> 5338.0
the entire

5334.719 --> 5341.28
intention and context and how serious

5338.0 --> 5345.52
you take yourself and the power you are

5341.28 --> 5349.04
attaining you just think power is only

5345.52 --> 5353.4400000000005
oh it's only more freedom only easier oh

5349.04 --> 5355.92
only relief yeah no no it's not

5353.44 --> 5358.32
that's what retards think and lazy

5355.92 --> 5362.4800000000005
pieces of [ __ ]

5358.32 --> 5365.759999999999
yeah no every power

5362.48 --> 5367.44
has a responsibility and that

5365.76 --> 5379.84
responsibility

5367.44 --> 5379.839999999999
you take it or it takes you

5385.92 --> 5390.96
you believe english has an existence in

5388.4 --> 5395.679
antiquity

5390.96 --> 5395.679
what uh

5396.48 --> 5403.44
no i don't think so

5400.4 --> 5407.04
but i think that roman

5403.44 --> 5409.919999999999
was probably an ancient english

5407.04 --> 5409.92
i think roman

5410.56 --> 5415.1990000000005
was actually a created language just

5413.199 --> 5416.159
like english it was created for the

5415.199 --> 5418.839999999999
empire

5416.159 --> 5420.0
and hey a lot of english is based on

5418.84 --> 5422.159000000001
roman

5420.0 --> 5424.56
and so is a lot of european language in

5422.159 --> 5424.5599999999995
general

5428.4 --> 5435.599999999999
is it called roman latin sorry

5432.88 --> 5436.32
roman well it was of the roman empire

5435.6 --> 5440.56
basically

5436.32 --> 5442.239
but it was called latin of course latin

5440.56 --> 5443.6
it's even called latin and dutch i don't

5442.239 --> 5447.5199999999995
know why you call it roman

5443.6 --> 5449.04
weird right but latin in its own right

5447.52 --> 5452.2390000000005
was probably just like

5449.04 --> 5455.44
english english a freshly created

5452.239 --> 5455.44
imperial language

5457.76 --> 5464.0
i don't even know how much of the roman

5461.28 --> 5466.48
empire was real but that language was

5464.0 --> 5469.199
certainly there

5466.48 --> 5472.5599999999995
and it is very likely to have been

5469.199 --> 5472.5599999999995
created from scratch

5475.04 --> 5482.0
all right and probably like english

5478.8 --> 5491.84
is designed to spread and to be

5482.0 --> 5491.84
compatible and dynamic so was latin

5502.48 --> 5505.599999999999
right george sanford but english is so

5505.28 --> 5507.92
yeah

5505.6 --> 5510.4800000000005
widespread exactly before because of the

5507.92 --> 5514.0
before mentioned reasons

5510.48 --> 5519.599999999999
it was made as a language to conquer

5514.0 --> 5521.92
to culturally conquer

5519.6 --> 5522.88
because it's just so dynamic so

5521.92 --> 5526.719
efficient so

5522.88 --> 5530.400000000001
clear with so much reach for the

5526.719 --> 5531.6
intellect right it's made it's designed

5530.4 --> 5533.28
for that

5531.6 --> 5534.719
and that's what makes it so great and

5533.28 --> 5538.4
dynamic and

5534.719 --> 5538.4
relatively easy to adopt

5540.8 --> 5546.96
i need to refresh in their water

5543.92 --> 5549.1990000000005
anyway i think i'm gonna round out the

5546.96 --> 5549.199
show

5549.36 --> 5563.36
how time has flown

5561.36 --> 5566.0
if you don't understand the english it

5563.36 --> 5569.04
is confusing

5566.0 --> 5569.6
right but why it's because english

5569.04 --> 5572.639
people

5569.6 --> 5575.360000000001
on average not take the typical brit

5572.639 --> 5577.12
or whatever but people that talk english

5575.36 --> 5580.239
often talk

5577.12 --> 5582.639
specialist right because the entire

5580.239 --> 5584.0
spectrum of available conversations that

5582.639 --> 5586.88
you could have with the le

5584.0 --> 5589.12
with the language of english is just

5586.88 --> 5591.92
unbelievably wide

5589.12 --> 5594.0
you could have technically every sort of

5591.92 --> 5594.56
conceivable conversation in english

5594.0 --> 5598.639
right

5594.56 --> 5602.0
it has defined what we can conceive of

5598.639 --> 5605.36
of conversing about english

5602.0 --> 5606.239
literally defined it for us it's that

5605.36 --> 5607.92
broad

5606.239 --> 5610.159
now there's other languages also have a

5607.92 --> 5612.32
very broad range in all directions

5610.159 --> 5613.28
english could just attain anything you

5612.32 --> 5615.12
could talk about

5613.28 --> 5617.04
anything in english and that's what

5615.12 --> 5619.44
makes it

5617.04 --> 5620.08
easy to adapt because hey you have a

5619.44 --> 5623.28
certain

5620.08 --> 5626.5599999999995
language in some remote region

5623.28 --> 5629.599999999999
it's kind of obscure you have your own

5626.56 --> 5631.120000000001
tradition and cultural angle to things

5629.6 --> 5632.159000000001
and like maybe there's a certain way of

5631.12 --> 5635.36
spiritual thinking

5632.159 --> 5637.599999999999
in the language built well guess what

5635.36 --> 5638.639
you could translate that to english and

5637.6 --> 5641.6
it would be

5638.639 --> 5645.6
in the same spirit and so because of

5641.6 --> 5648.96
that a lot of people will be able to

5645.6 --> 5651.6
do all language into english because

5648.96 --> 5653.84
english it reaches so wide in its

5651.6 --> 5656.8
meaning right if you're going to try

5653.84 --> 5658.639
another language it's much more niche

5656.8 --> 5660.719
you're going to be like uh well why do

5658.639 --> 5661.84
they have like 20 different words for

5660.719 --> 5665.6
ice

5661.84 --> 5668.2390000000005
we don't even have eyes here right

5665.6 --> 5669.1990000000005
well a whole other thing about certain

5668.239 --> 5671.44
plants or whatever

5669.199 --> 5673.36
like they don't have any words for that

5671.44 --> 5678.239
well english has words for

5673.36 --> 5678.239
everything absolutely everything

5679.679 --> 5682.88
most things not not absolutely

5682.32 --> 5685.28
everything

5682.88 --> 5687.04
but most things anyway i'm rounding out

5685.28 --> 5689.44
