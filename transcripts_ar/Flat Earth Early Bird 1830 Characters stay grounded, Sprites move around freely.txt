285.68 --> 289.16
standby ready to

291.199 --> 294.8
go so yeah

295.12 --> 303.08
yesterday my own show was pretty good I

298.32 --> 306.24
thought and Flat Earth debates was

303.08 --> 310.52
interesting it yeah it lasted a bit long

306.24 --> 312.32
though like it was like a a Bev day Bev

310.52 --> 316.479
and a crony came

312.32 --> 319.44
on and the show literally went on till

316.479 --> 322.28
like my God how

319.44 --> 325.039
long I think it was in total like a six-

322.28 --> 325.039
hour show or

328.479 --> 332.24
something

330.56 --> 333.31
live forever

332.24 --> 335.52
what

333.31 --> 341.759
[Music]

335.52 --> 341.75899999999996
okay don't know about that but just live

350.319 --> 358.40000000000003
good right so yeah flat debates

354.639 --> 360.28000000000003
long oh Benjamin is going full ballistic

358.4 --> 363.919
on India

360.28 --> 363.919
it's kind of freaky kind of

374.12 --> 380.4
gross and later I also watched a movie

377.759 --> 383.12
that seen before action

380.4 --> 385.63899999999995
movie second version I I I kind of want

383.12 --> 387.919
to see the first one now but was like

385.639 --> 390.88
something that just popped up on Netflix

387.919 --> 393.919
The Transporter too I like what what

390.88 --> 396.319
kind of a name is that but I mean that

393.919 --> 396.31899999999996
movie

396.88 --> 401.24
is like it's

401.72 --> 406.96000000000004
ridiculously it it's it's weird the

404.52 --> 408.08
movie is weird like the action is so

406.96 --> 411.79999999999995
over the

408.08 --> 413.68
top it's like it is really like so over

411.8 --> 416.759
the top there's no person that could see

413.68 --> 419.96
that and just like not feel weird about

416.759 --> 422.319
it because the action is just

419.96 --> 427.63899999999995
choreographed like almost like half

422.319 --> 427.639
Jackie Chan style but not

427.68 --> 434.24
funny it's really rough but like just

432.12 --> 438.56
surreal and he does Maneuvers with his

434.24 --> 438.56
car that are like totally

439.52 --> 445.4
impossible like unless you were like a

442.36 --> 448.12
god you're like oh yeah I've absolute

445.4 --> 451.12
perfect Mastery of physics in all forms

448.12 --> 455.599
like yeah then that could work

451.12 --> 459.319
sure otherwise it's like what the [ __ ]

455.599 --> 462.319
it's extremely entertaining though as an

459.319 --> 466.36
action movie I mean I really like

462.319 --> 469.24
popcorn time not that I eat popcorn but

466.36 --> 473.599
that's the feeling I got so if you want

469.24 --> 476.199
to see like a pumping crazy ass action

473.599 --> 478.319
movie yeah The Transporter 2 is

476.199 --> 481.319
definitely going to do

478.319 --> 481.319
it

483.68 --> 487.08
Napoleon oh

490.84 --> 498.4
okay I don't think I've seen that one

494.159 --> 498.4
right but so yeah my day was

508.24 --> 511.24
cool

518.32 --> 523.599
um yeah also there's apparently just

520.839 --> 523.599
trolls going

524.04 --> 529.519
around like trying to create a rift

527.32 --> 531.24
again between within

529.519 --> 535.6
fed

531.24 --> 538.44
specifically to Nathan and me for some

535.6 --> 540.44
reason they really don't like us being

538.44 --> 542.399
friends and they're like making lots of

540.44 --> 546.5600000000001
effort

542.399 --> 550.04
to to try to split us like our

546.56 --> 550.04
cooperation apart

556.88 --> 561.279
somehow but I mean it's not really going

559.04 --> 561.279
to

562.839 --> 568.6400000000001
work and like after the after show

566.2 --> 570.72
recording was over like like we talked

568.64 --> 573.8
about it for like

570.72 --> 576.9200000000001
hours like it's never going to work

573.8 --> 576.92
trolls are getting

577.68 --> 582.4399999999999
desperate but it doesn't work so

598.12 --> 601.12
anyhow

614.43 --> 617.4599999999999
[Music]

618.92 --> 622.279
right so yeah what have you been up

627.8 --> 633.68
to oh yeah there's also this been going

631.04 --> 636.56
for a while but man this huge Farmers

633.68 --> 636.56
protest in

637.48 --> 643.88
Germany it's pretty

640.36 --> 647.76
heavy some of you might have seen some

643.88 --> 647.76
clips about of it here and

654.079 --> 661.56
there how did the new improved version

657.68 --> 661.56
turn out I I don't know

668.959 --> 674.56
Tommy I just know like like I wasn't

672.32 --> 679.12
going to have any of it I mean I'm not

674.56 --> 683.8
like just ball winning around all the

679.12 --> 685.0
time I'm not doing that anyway and like

683.8 --> 686.8
yeah there's going to be people

685.0 --> 689.6
complaining about what I do and there's

686.8 --> 692.959
compl people complaining about

689.6 --> 695.16
Neil and about Brian and about all of

692.959 --> 698.04
them QE like there's people just

695.16 --> 700.8389999999999
complaining about

698.04 --> 704.12
everything nobody cares or well I don't

700.839 --> 706.9200000000001
care and Nathan shouldn't really care

704.12 --> 710.399
either I just see that as

706.92 --> 712.88
trolls right I mean steamy traveler and

710.399 --> 715.48
he's pretty cool he's been very friendly

712.88 --> 718.6
and supportive of me he really doesn't

715.48 --> 722.6
like what Nathan does yeah but I don't

718.6 --> 725.44
let him whine to me about

722.6 --> 727.399
it I just say yeah yeah yeah you don't

725.44 --> 728.8800000000001
like it fine don't watch it then I'm

727.399 --> 731.72
going to watch it I'm going to be a part

728.88 --> 733.88
of it and that's going to keep

731.72 --> 734.88
going it's not always going to be

733.88 --> 738.4399999999999
without

734.88 --> 738.4399999999999
friction but I don't

739.76 --> 745.04
care like I need that and they need

746.839 --> 755.519
me like they told me so if they're going

751.8 --> 759.16
to tell me I'm going to take that

755.519 --> 761.279
serious right I sometimes feel like man

759.16 --> 764.4399999999999
what am I even doing here do you even

761.279 --> 766.92
need me but they do it's just sometimes

764.44 --> 769.1600000000001
the feelings are around where it's like

766.92 --> 771.519
it just I feel really

769.16 --> 773.8389999999999
inconvenient but that is pretty much it

771.519 --> 776.88
and it's just a feeling it's

773.839 --> 780.839
not anything other than

776.88 --> 780.8389999999999
that so I have no problem

782.24 --> 787.32
problems with how things go on fed it

785.079 --> 790.279
doesn't always go great sometimes it

787.32 --> 793.0790000000001
seems like everybody's after me I don't

790.279 --> 796.079
care like well it's annoying when that

793.079 --> 798.0
happens but it's like oh it's just one

796.079 --> 802.5999999999999
of those days and I'm going to be

798.0 --> 807.76
probably bit but yeah so what oh no a

802.6 --> 809.94
bad day oh got to I got to quit now no

807.76 --> 813.019
way

809.94 --> 813.019
[Music]

832.279 --> 837.759
anyway right think I'm going to take a

834.44 --> 839.639
bite on my Illuminati

837.759 --> 843.0790000000001
C

839.639 --> 846.5600000000001
since the chat's not exactly

843.079 --> 849.0
exploding take your time it's

846.56 --> 853.4799999999999
early it's probably freezing where

849.0 --> 855.839
you're at as well anyway

853.48 --> 859.0790000000001
cheers oh

855.839 --> 861.8800000000001
yeah and Ben these [ __ ] trolls at

859.079 --> 865.12
Owen Benjamin were just suddenly whining

861.88 --> 865.12
about how I was a

866.16 --> 873.3199999999999
Fed it was like really pushing that like

870.399 --> 875.48
oh I even like try to ask him like so

873.32 --> 878.48
what

875.48 --> 882.36
agency like what agency am I working for

878.48 --> 882.36
and when am I finally going to get that

882.839 --> 891.1600000000001
paycheck but he just kept going like

887.279 --> 895.079
what I what the [ __ ] did I ever say

891.16 --> 897.279
wrong I did say like yeah well I do I am

895.079 --> 899.7589999999999
part of

897.279 --> 903.079
fed but that's stands for Flat Earth

899.759 --> 906.0790000000001
debate not not a federal

903.079 --> 910.8
agency not the

906.079 --> 910.8
FED anyway it was

911.48 --> 916.36
weird but yeah it seems like some Arwin

914.279 --> 917.36
haters have found their way over into

916.36 --> 920.72
the

917.36 --> 924.9590000000001
rumble chat of Owen Benjamin as

920.72 --> 924.9590000000001
well so that's just freaking

925.0 --> 932.36
great I have seem have to have

929.24 --> 934.72
have I seem to have haters just

932.36 --> 938.9590000000001
following me around on social media

934.72 --> 942.36
stalking me Cyber stalkers

938.959 --> 945.16
huh right saying all this

942.36 --> 948.12
[ __ ] never actually backing everything

945.16 --> 952.36
so there's people just actively going

948.12 --> 955.44
around trying to spread rumors for some

952.36 --> 957.6
reason and I wonder if they actually

955.44 --> 960.6
know the

957.6 --> 960.6
reason

969.519 --> 974.279
it doesn't matter

971.519 --> 977.6
like at this point doing that sort of

974.279 --> 980.8
[ __ ] especially when I'm there I mean

977.6 --> 980.8000000000001
the only thing it does

981.04 --> 988.199
is highlight to the place I'm

984.959 --> 991.1199999999999
at that there's just disgusting trolls

988.199 --> 991.12
Stu talking me

992.279 --> 996.279
and and that I apparently trigger those

995.16 --> 999.639
types of

996.279 --> 1002.639
people I trigger a lot of crazies and

999.639 --> 1002.639
yeah so it does ow and

1003.319 --> 1008.92
Benjamin so I should only find sympathy

1006.639 --> 1008.92
for

1011.12 --> 1016.12
it yeah I hope Tera doesn't watch

1013.399 --> 1020.48
yesterday this over Ben I know hello

1016.12 --> 1020.48
slow mo moon buggy yeah

1020.6 --> 1025.199
although

1022.199 --> 1027.039
yeah I mean he might have some

1025.199 --> 1029.799
understanding for it but I mean is not

1027.039 --> 1035.0
going to have a good time watching that

1029.799 --> 1040.72
I mean Owen did like go he was basically

1035.0 --> 1040.72
like poking hard hard hard at the

1047.4 --> 1051.88
Indians what happened yeah you're just

1049.88 --> 1056.2
going to have to watch it I'm not going

1051.88 --> 1056.2
to like go into the details

1062.919 --> 1069.44
thanks the Irish love being roasted by

1065.52 --> 1069.44
Elby yeah but that's the Irish

1071.16 --> 1076.2
though I mean Brian laughs every time

1074.039 --> 1079.28
somebody says something racist about the

1076.2 --> 1081.559
Irish during fed too and he's like

1079.28 --> 1082.72
genuinely laughing for that so that's an

1081.559 --> 1085.12
Irish

1082.72 --> 1089.2
thing I get

1085.12 --> 1092.559
it a good quality by the way to be able

1089.2 --> 1092.559
to laugh about that so

1100.64 --> 1108.4
easily right but hey I Look to kind of

1105.28 --> 1111.72
like hook it up with like something

1108.4 --> 1113.88
older that I said I mean India has a lot

1111.72 --> 1116.08
of freaking gamas and they're like

1113.88 --> 1119.44
really terrible gamas and like teret

1116.08 --> 1123.039
knows this like we discussed

1119.44 --> 1125.64
that right and so Owen is now literally

1123.039 --> 1129.36
getting the entire gamma hiive from

1125.64 --> 1130.5200000000002
India behind him or behind him after him

1129.36 --> 1132.6
and that's really kind of what's

1130.52 --> 1134.9189999999999
happening so I think teret could

1132.6 --> 1137.32
probably even understand it's just not

1134.919 --> 1139.8400000000001
going to be fun for him to like watch

1137.32 --> 1144.0
that entire thing

1139.84 --> 1144.0
so but he's not going to do

1146.559 --> 1150.0
that I doubt

1152.559 --> 1158.72
it and to be fair in a way you know what

1155.72 --> 1161.44
I had a bit of a weird feeling with it

1158.72 --> 1165.6000000000001
because I mean

1161.44 --> 1168.76
Owen like made like this giant point

1165.6 --> 1170.7199999999998
about how he was grossed out

1168.76 --> 1174.12
by certain

1170.72 --> 1174.1200000000001
things but I

1177.919 --> 1183.2
mean I've never seen so much [ __ ] talk

1181.2 --> 1187.24
let's just say it like

1183.2 --> 1189.679
that and it made me feel like uh well

1187.24 --> 1192.64
depending on the circumstances you can

1189.679 --> 1196.919
be quite the manure truck

1192.64 --> 1200.64
Owen seems like it's not that terrible

1196.919 --> 1200.64
to you since you like see seem to

1203.36 --> 1207.6
like throw it around quite a

1211.32 --> 1221.2
bit yeah that that I'll stick it to

1216.6 --> 1221.1999999999998
that the rest you can imagine about

1222.4 --> 1229.159
it so that felt a bit like H I guess it

1227.08 --> 1232.52
doesn't really grow like I didn't see

1229.159 --> 1235.0390000000002
you like almost throw up even once over

1232.52 --> 1237.9189999999999
talk he seemed to be having a lot of fun

1235.039 --> 1241.919
and being having no problems whatsoever

1237.919 --> 1244.919
describing all this very disgusting [ __ ]

1241.919 --> 1244.919
literally

1244.94 --> 1251.48
[Music]

1247.679 --> 1255.3600000000001
so or maybe it's just like when he

1251.48 --> 1258.24
like goes after something then like he's

1255.36 --> 1260.9189999999999
not affected by it I don't know it just

1258.24 --> 1260.919
felt a bit

1261.28 --> 1264.28
like

1264.84 --> 1269.799
whatever anyway it was not it was kind

1268.0 --> 1272.72
of funny here and there it was not

1269.799 --> 1276.6
really the most enjoyable show because

1272.72 --> 1276.6000000000001
it's just too much [ __ ] going

1287.039 --> 1290.039
on

1297.279 --> 1300.72
just realiz like if you're going to

1298.679 --> 1304.039
watch that show from beginning to end it

1300.72 --> 1306.159
is kind of the Biff

1304.039 --> 1308.919
experience

1306.159 --> 1311.279
right from Back to the

1308.919 --> 1315.5590000000002
Future what always keeps happening to

1311.279 --> 1320.039
him it it kind of will be like that if

1315.559 --> 1320.039
you just watch that stream

1326.679 --> 1330.48
all

1327.4 --> 1333.679
right anyhow I'm going to take a bite

1330.48 --> 1333.679
out of my Illuminati

1334.2 --> 1338.529
C

1335.27 --> 1338.529
[Music]

1346.96 --> 1349.96
wo

1354.0 --> 1356.36
hello

1358.44 --> 1368.24
clamy that BBC documentary sorry slowmo

1363.36 --> 1368.24
Which BBC documentary are you talking

1373.159 --> 1379.96
about one about India and their

1376.96 --> 1379.96
habits

1381.679 --> 1385.3600000000001
well it's

1382.919 --> 1388.48
probably not made

1385.36 --> 1391.4799999999998
of but I would really in a way I would

1388.48 --> 1395.159
like some honest clarification about the

1391.48 --> 1397.52
cultural Rifts within India

1395.159 --> 1401.1200000000001
itself because apparently there are

1397.52 --> 1403.9189999999999
these weird shitty

1401.12 --> 1409.799
people there culture that are like

1403.919 --> 1412.919
weirdly obsessed and it's very gross it

1409.799 --> 1416.559
is but I mean I'm very certain that it's

1412.919 --> 1416.5590000000002
not like everybody definitely

1417.2 --> 1423.72
not I definitely think that I mean

1420.84 --> 1426.039
terets from what I've gathered so far

1423.72 --> 1427.6000000000001
from everything he's talked about he's a

1426.039 --> 1430.6
pretty clean

1427.6 --> 1430.6
guy

1430.84 --> 1436.8799999999999
so I get a feeling he doesn't really

1434.24 --> 1438.919
like that part of

1436.88 --> 1440.279
India

1438.919 --> 1444.8400000000001
and I don't blame

1440.279 --> 1444.84
him I wouldn't really like that part

1445.44 --> 1451.52
either bro slowmo could you please not

1448.96 --> 1453.88
just put that like that in the chat for

1451.52 --> 1453.8799999999999
[ __ ]

1454.64 --> 1458.0
sake that's

1460.36 --> 1466.1589999999999
just

1462.4 --> 1469.799
thanks okay we don't need to know the

1466.159 --> 1469.7990000000002
details of that thank you

1470.24 --> 1474.44
H it just gross

1477.559 --> 1480.559
things

1491.08 --> 1498.6399999999999
yeah yeah by the way ironically also

1495.6 --> 1503.8799999999999
after having watched all that out B

1498.64 --> 1507.44
show I did actually watch or half of it

1503.88 --> 1511.6000000000001
an Indian Bollywood

1507.44 --> 1515.159
movie and I have to say it was very

1511.6 --> 1518.1589999999999
tough not to like see own benam making

1515.159 --> 1520.24
commentary on it

1518.159 --> 1524.0390000000002
secretly

1520.24 --> 1524.039
oh and it was kind of

1526.679 --> 1532.279
weird

1529.2 --> 1535.3600000000001
it was not like really as entertaining

1532.279 --> 1538.24
as like the rrr

1535.36 --> 1540.76
movie was of a different scale like you

1538.24 --> 1542.559
could really see the CGI in this one

1540.76 --> 1544.919
it's like what the hell did you guys

1542.559 --> 1544.9189999999999
like

1545.08 --> 1550.6
use just the graphics engine of an

1548.039 --> 1552.64
advanced computer game for this entire

1550.6 --> 1555.76
thing like that's what you used as the

1552.64 --> 1557.679
special effects you just use that engine

1555.76 --> 1560.919
of a certain because it just looked

1557.679 --> 1565.919
looked like a video game like a lot of

1560.919 --> 1568.0800000000002
it even though it was pretty decent

1565.919 --> 1570.0
Graphics but it just still looked like

1568.08 --> 1573.559
it was made from a video game and some

1570.0 --> 1577.2
like Figures were like oh my God that's

1573.559 --> 1580.32
terrible although look who's talking I

1577.2 --> 1582.52
mean there's plenty of Hollywood movies

1580.32 --> 1584.9189999999999
that oh look oh that's the younger

1582.52 --> 1588.36
version of this actor with the young

1584.919 --> 1590.44
face it looks so real oh

1588.36 --> 1592.1999999999998
like Trum Legacy and like you have to

1590.44 --> 1594.6000000000001
stare against that face all the time

1592.2 --> 1598.1200000000001
you're like oh oh God it's so [ __ ]

1594.6 --> 1600.84
ugly ah it's such an ugly video game

1598.12 --> 1600.84
face get it

1602.279 --> 1609.64
away yeah there this movie had a bit of

1605.159 --> 1614.44
that too like like no that just does not

1609.64 --> 1614.44
look like a real thing no matter what is

1615.36 --> 1621.6399999999999
like that's like the the the Scorpion

1619.24 --> 1624.24
Rock dude from The Scorpion King or

1621.64 --> 1628.24
whatever that movie was that really

1624.24 --> 1631.279
infamously ugly CGI of the

1628.24 --> 1634.36
rock like it is that

1631.279 --> 1636.96
level although in that movie it really

1634.36 --> 1638.799
stands out how ugly it is compared to

1636.96 --> 1641.6000000000001
the rest of the movie with this it's all

1638.799 --> 1645.9189999999999
a bit like

1641.6 --> 1649.399
what weird CGI

1645.919 --> 1652.64
world and like it was mostly CGI I mean

1649.399 --> 1652.6399999999999
there weren't even that many

1653.96 --> 1659.559
people very limited cast now that I

1657.039 --> 1662.559
think about it something that rrr

1659.559 --> 1666.9189999999999
definitely did not have they had tons of

1662.559 --> 1670.559
people like big stage stuff hundreds of

1666.919 --> 1675.3990000000001
people in there that made it very

1670.559 --> 1675.399
interesting this one not so much

1676.519 --> 1679.519
anyway

1686.559 --> 1690.279
I don't remember even what it was

1690.32 --> 1695.76
called right but I'm like halfway I just

1693.24 --> 1698.0
had to go to bed at some point otherwise

1695.76 --> 1699.279
I'll keep getting super late on the

1698.0 --> 1703.159
early bir

1699.279 --> 1705.64
show I don't want that oh yeah it's

1703.159 --> 1709.8400000000001
called ID

1705.64 --> 1712.8400000000001
purush AI purush

1709.84 --> 1712.84
sorry

1712.88 --> 1717.6000000000001
yeah and those bowmen are pretty

1718.44 --> 1724.6000000000001
badass I got some real like Indian

1721.6 --> 1727.6399999999999
models for that and they do look pretty

1724.6 --> 1730.9599999999998
[Music]

1727.64 --> 1734.0800000000002
badass all right so that's the thing I'm

1730.96 --> 1737.44
watching I mean but it has some like

1734.08 --> 1741.9189999999999
weird computer like CGI it that that

1737.44 --> 1744.6000000000001
they really were very Reckless with it's

1741.919 --> 1748.279
like yeah when it looks like that you

1744.6 --> 1751.32
shouldn't really like do it like 20

1748.279 --> 1755.08
times in one frame and then the same

1751.32 --> 1759.76
animation and like that really stands

1755.08 --> 1759.76
out you should do that but oh

1764.679 --> 1770.5590000000002
well don't have a yeah whatever clammy I

1768.08 --> 1770.559
don't think

1771.0 --> 1778.64
so I think Nathan needs to stop

1775.519 --> 1782.1200000000001
being pushed around

1778.64 --> 1784.96
by yeah I don't know people that are

1782.12 --> 1788.0
just anti Arwin that just don't like me

1784.96 --> 1791.44
don't like what I do anything I do and

1788.0 --> 1795.64
hey screw that I get people all the time

1791.44 --> 1795.64
complaining about other people as

1796.08 --> 1799.32
well and

1801.44 --> 1808.679
yeah people with unstable moods

1805.519 --> 1811.32
suddenly opposing us out of nowhere

1808.679 --> 1811.3200000000002
again

1812.039 --> 1817.48
right you can't blame that kind of stuff

1816.039 --> 1820.84
on my

1817.48 --> 1824.44
presence or the even the things how I do

1820.84 --> 1828.6399999999999
it yeah I do my best I improve

1824.44 --> 1831.3600000000001
measurably provably on record and that

1828.64 --> 1831.3600000000001
should be good

1833.6 --> 1839.48
enough right Nathan is not going to just

1837.24 --> 1841.279
tell me like oh you have to stop this

1839.48 --> 1846.039
you have to stop that you have to change

1841.279 --> 1849.24
this it's like yeah I'm sorry I'm sorry

1846.039 --> 1851.919
but we don't have a contract in order

1849.24 --> 1855.2
for you to change my contract on how I

1851.919 --> 1857.96
should be behaving thanks yeah you're

1855.2 --> 1860.76
going to have to pay me then if you're

1857.96 --> 1865.1200000000001
going to like like actually pay me not

1860.76 --> 1865.12
like €1 every two months or

1866.0 --> 1869.0
something

1879.24 --> 1883.44
so so don't worry about it

1886.159 --> 1889.159
tamy

1890.679 --> 1893.44
you like the diversity of personalities

1892.6 --> 1896.0
on

1893.44 --> 1898.159
fed did did you catch that part of the

1896.0 --> 1900.0
conversation we had because we did

1898.159 --> 1902.7600000000002
actually mention

1900.0 --> 1904.799
that like they the guys brought it up

1902.76 --> 1907.84
Adam can brought it up like literally

1904.799 --> 1907.84
the diversity of

1908.159 --> 1912.2
personalities but it's very true

1912.48 --> 1918.3990000000001
though we're all very different

1916.159 --> 1920.279
individuals

1918.399 --> 1922.4399999999998
but we're all counting on that

1920.279 --> 1925.0
difference you know you didn't hear that

1922.44 --> 1925.0
oh wow

1927.639 --> 1931.12
synchronicities all right I'm going to

1929.24 --> 1934.6
turn my coffee

1931.12 --> 1934.6
on be right

1946.08 --> 1949.08
back

1976.88 --> 1979.48
and and I'm

1984.6 --> 1988.24
back well flat

1997.36 --> 2002.76
land dude shut the [ __ ] up are what the

2001.159 --> 2006.72
[ __ ] are you whining

2002.76 --> 2009.24
about Nathan does not bully me he's just

2006.72 --> 2010.76
getting being wh at by trolls and he's

2009.24 --> 2013.24
trying to do something about he's

2010.76 --> 2018.12
probably having

2013.24 --> 2018.1200000000001
some orientation difficulties with

2018.76 --> 2024.48
it and these trolls like are really

2022.24 --> 2026.919
devious and if they think it'll work

2024.48 --> 2029.72
they'll like write very serious

2026.919 --> 2033.279
elaborate written letters and everything

2029.72 --> 2035.48
like they do anything to get to

2033.279 --> 2037.679
you

2035.48 --> 2040.279
anything like these freaks would

2037.679 --> 2042.519
probably even like spend money to hire

2040.279 --> 2046.519
people just if they thought that they

2042.519 --> 2049.839
could be able to convince you of

2046.519 --> 2054.48
something people are freaks man these

2049.839 --> 2054.48
trolls they're really freaks they're

2062.72 --> 2069.1189999999997
disgusting and I think Nathan just kind

2065.2 --> 2072.0
of fell for it for a bit and he needs to

2069.119 --> 2072.0
just not do

2072.919 --> 2077.839
that I'm pretty damn sure I got mostly

2076.639 --> 2081.879
everyone in

2077.839 --> 2081.879
fed behind my back on

2088.0 --> 2095.639
that right and I thought it was kind of

2092.599 --> 2098.96
stupid cuz Nathan should have addressed

2095.639 --> 2101.2000000000003
it in sky we had the conversation he

2098.96 --> 2103.48
should have continued that conversation

2101.2 --> 2106.3999999999996
and not started on the live show that

2103.48 --> 2106.4
was a dumb

2112.72 --> 2120.24
move cuz it just proved that he failed

2117.68 --> 2122.8799999999997
he failed to understand the situation

2120.24 --> 2122.8799999999997
what it really

2123.72 --> 2128.7999999999997
was you failed to see that he was

2126.32 --> 2128.8
getting

2135.64 --> 2141.52
trolled right cuz there's tons of people

2138.72 --> 2144.5989999999997
out there they don't really care they

2141.52 --> 2148.04
just want to see us break apart that's

2144.599 --> 2150.839
all they want cuz together we're strong

2148.04 --> 2153.0
and they want us not strong they want us

2150.839 --> 2155.72
broken apart so they will try to create

2153.0 --> 2157.52
a rift between every single individual

2155.72 --> 2160.04
at every

2157.52 --> 2163.079
opportunity that they can

2160.04 --> 2165.0
see and they will keep doing that they

2163.079 --> 2168.44
have been doing it for years and they

2165.0 --> 2171.8
will keep doing it and it never ends and

2168.44 --> 2171.8
it is never going to

2173.24 --> 2178.319
end and maybe Nathan forgot that for a

2178.44 --> 2184.359
moment or maybe he just didn't really

2181.079 --> 2186.8390000000004
want it anymore in that

2184.359 --> 2189.92
moment whatever it was it's not my

2186.839 --> 2192.56
freaking problem cuz hey you're going to

2189.92 --> 2194.92
take me as I am and that's with bwin

2192.56 --> 2198.599
which is literally a part of me it's not

2194.92 --> 2198.599
a simulation it is

2200.359 --> 2207.16
me you're not going to tell me to to let

2204.359 --> 2211.2799999999997
him die or anything

2207.16 --> 2213.7599999999998
yeah CU BN can never be defeated and

2211.28 --> 2213.76
that's a

2215.68 --> 2220.0789999999997
fact

2217.319 --> 2223.839
right we need

2220.079 --> 2226.599
him even if people don't like

2223.839 --> 2230.7599999999998
him I don't really like them at times

2226.599 --> 2230.76
who cares it is what it

2233.0 --> 2238.96
is right and I don't use Ballwin to

2236.24 --> 2241.2799999999997
confuse or dilute the

2238.96 --> 2244.8
situation I never do

2241.28 --> 2247.48
that usually do it to

2244.8 --> 2250.8
address something that I see that I

2247.48 --> 2252.88
think that the flat earthers or aiders

2250.8 --> 2255.6800000000003
are getting wrong about the

2252.88 --> 2259.8
ball that's what Ballwin does there he's

2255.68 --> 2259.7999999999997
like quality control for ball

2262.2 --> 2270.0789999999997
belief and you need that yeah I can do

2266.8 --> 2274.04
that better than any of

2270.079 --> 2276.119
them and they're all decent with it

2274.04 --> 2278.4
they're okay trying to figure out what

2276.119 --> 2280.92
wallers are they're going to do

2278.4 --> 2282.6800000000003
especially in like

2280.92 --> 2284.96
discussions right because they had so

2282.68 --> 2289.3999999999996
much training like but I know more than

2284.96 --> 2289.4
that because I am one it's in

2292.2 --> 2297.68
me the D in fed stays like yeah

2305.52 --> 2308.52
sure

2312.68 --> 2318.0
B wi is great be careful saying that I

2314.96 --> 2318.88
mean he is obnoxious though like once it

2318.0 --> 2323.2
gets

2318.88 --> 2325.44
going like I always have to like kind of

2323.2 --> 2328.56
like let the cage open a bit and then

2325.44 --> 2330.2400000000002
he's going to be there but I mean like

2328.56 --> 2332.68
it doesn't take long before I have to

2330.24 --> 2335.2799999999997
like actively like yeah you're going to

2332.68 --> 2337.3999999999996
go back in the cage because if I just

2335.28 --> 2340.0400000000004
let him go he's just going to go until

2337.4 --> 2342.2400000000002
like the entire [ __ ] world hates him

2340.04 --> 2345.8
though

2342.24 --> 2347.2
cuz yeah that's just what happen So

2345.8 --> 2348.04
eventually I have to like put him back

2347.2 --> 2351.359
in the

2348.04 --> 2351.359
bottle I get

2354.16 --> 2360.04
it draws like to claim Echo chamber on

2357.4 --> 2362.96
fed yeah well win not not so much right

2360.04 --> 2366.56
yeah blue pill Devolution you get it

2362.96 --> 2368.64
it's all just to try to divide us these

2366.56 --> 2372.68
people are desperate they're like

2368.64 --> 2374.839
throwing their full un Diplo diplomatic

2372.68 --> 2378.1189999999997
works at

2374.839 --> 2382.24
it probably going to create a

2378.119 --> 2386.04
specific diplomacy department at the UN

2382.24 --> 2389.24
just to try to get the FED members on

2386.04 --> 2390.8
YouTube on the internet to stop

2389.24 --> 2394.04
cooperating they're probably going to

2390.8 --> 2394.04
have their own un

2395.4 --> 2398.4
Department

2399.68 --> 2403.72
anyway I'm going to get my coffee I'll

2401.24 --> 2403.72
be right

2425.359 --> 2428.359
back

2455.319 --> 2458.319
spe

2481.01 --> 2488.2400000000002
[Music]

2483.28 --> 2488.2400000000002
people are too [ __ ] to go super

2494.68 --> 2498.8799999999997
hey steamy

2496.68 --> 2503.3999999999996
traveler good to see

2498.88 --> 2503.4
you hey seeking star water good to see

2503.92 --> 2512.119
you ah everybody's here typing in

2509.119 --> 2512.119
bed

2514.88 --> 2521.2000000000003
what so mistake you mean because it's

2517.92 --> 2521.2000000000003
now tough to get out of

2521.8 --> 2527.319
bed yeah today was tough to get out of

2524.4 --> 2530.56
bed man it was so cold I mean it was

2527.319 --> 2532.7599999999998
literally -4° okay yeah it's tough to

2530.56 --> 2533.839
get out of bed when it's -4 degrees in

2532.76 --> 2536.88
your

2533.839 --> 2538.96
room it's just like you got to wait

2536.88 --> 2542.079
until it's like

2538.96 --> 2543.68
properly vibrating till it's like you're

2542.079 --> 2546.3590000000004
like in the starting blocks it just

2543.68 --> 2548.7599999999998
happens sometimes when it's cold if to

2546.359 --> 2551.5989999999997
wake until you're like ready to jump out

2548.76 --> 2553.3190000000004
and then just like quickly throw open

2551.599 --> 2555.2400000000002
the blankets and quickly put on the

2553.319 --> 2556.839
clothes and quickly close the door and

2555.24 --> 2559.68
then quickly install the heating and

2556.839 --> 2559.68
then just like

2561.839 --> 2568.2
oh I managed today

2565.2 --> 2568.2
though

2575.16 --> 2578.16
that

2585.559 --> 2589.599
programing

2587.04 --> 2592.16
duper

2589.599 --> 2595.119
what I don't know I don't know what

2592.16 --> 2598.0
would be best though I I don't really

2595.119 --> 2601.599
want to go into programming again please

2598.0 --> 2603.319
but I mean I just thought like oh C++ or

2601.599 --> 2608.04
something or whatever they use these

2603.319 --> 2611.359
days man I dude I am just it's so

2608.04 --> 2613.96
it's kind of out of my league

2611.359 --> 2616.5989999999997
man I'm in I'm like in that position

2613.96 --> 2619.319
where I'm like yeah I would ask my

2616.599 --> 2621.599
programmer that

2619.319 --> 2626.2799999999997
question cuz I'm not

2621.599 --> 2626.28
that I'm just kind of a designer

2634.68 --> 2639.5989999999997
guyus 20 degrees

2637.96 --> 2643.96
jeez

2639.599 --> 2643.96
Fahrenheit what the how cold is

2645.119 --> 2649.6800000000003
that that's that's like crazy

2650.28 --> 2656.4
cold but are you on like are you on

2653.04 --> 2658.599
Antarctica now seeking star water did

2656.4 --> 2661.04
you tunnel all the way

2658.599 --> 2663.2400000000002
to

2661.04 --> 2664.48
Antarctic like yeah I was just clearing

2663.24 --> 2667.2799999999997
out the

2664.48 --> 2670.16
snow got CAU stop doing clearing out the

2667.28 --> 2672.7200000000003
snow for a bit and then like oh yeah

2670.16 --> 2674.319
after a month it turned out I was like

2672.72 --> 2677.9599999999996
in

2674.319 --> 2681.5589999999997
Antarctica no I would make a funny book

2677.96 --> 2681.559
though children's story or

2688.48 --> 2692.4
something how much is that in

2694.96 --> 2697.96
Celsius

2704.079 --> 2713.599
Min - 32 degrees

2708.319 --> 2713.599
Jesus holy [ __ ] that is

2714.64 --> 2720.0
Ah that's like careful not to stick out

2717.76 --> 2724.3590000000004
your tongue for too long because it

2720.0 --> 2724.359
freezes off type of cold

2724.88 --> 2727.88
dang

2754.88 --> 2757.88
for

2759.079 --> 2761.559
need have

2761.96 --> 2765.599
acid okay

2764.33 --> 2768.5989999999997
[Music]

2765.599 --> 2768.599
duper

2769.599 --> 2775.839
huh y the game by the way doesn't need

2772.4 --> 2775.839
Sprites it's not that type of

2778.119 --> 2785.28
game look if somebody would actually be

2781.68 --> 2788.0
willing to like help program it we'd

2785.28 --> 2791.2000000000003
have to have a meeting and then I'll

2788.0 --> 2794.0
start explaining it from scratch one

2791.2 --> 2796.64
onone draw it

2794.0 --> 2800.24
out I don't really want to do it

2796.64 --> 2802.96
here but yeah duper I mean I do kind of

2800.24 --> 2805.16
appreciate the offer if that is what

2802.96 --> 2805.16
that

2809.28 --> 2814.7200000000003
is so I might hold you up on that on

2812.04 --> 2819.079
some point derer will be kind of good I

2814.72 --> 2821.2799999999997
mean you're my protector it you might as

2819.079 --> 2824.28
well if you if you know a bit of

2821.28 --> 2824.28
programming that would be

2829.839 --> 2836.44
awesome right but a good start to really

2832.72 --> 2840.9199999999996
be able to program a bull Dash

2836.44 --> 2844.64
game it would be very useful if you were

2840.92 --> 2846.76
able to actually study a boulder dash

2844.64 --> 2849.0
game programming

2846.76 --> 2852.2000000000003
to understand what is happening in the

2849.0 --> 2856.119
buer dash game because buer Dash games

2852.2 --> 2859.16
function in a very very specific way

2856.119 --> 2861.88
there's very specific things happening

2859.16 --> 2863.839
which is what makes it work exactly like

2861.88 --> 2866.559
a bullet Dash game it's like a puzzle

2863.839 --> 2868.7599999999998
the programming itself is a puzzle

2866.559 --> 2872.0400000000004
that's very specific there are things

2868.76 --> 2872.0400000000004
off the entire thing is

2873.559 --> 2880.44
[ __ ] that's the tricky part about it

2877.319 --> 2883.4
but I know how it works I know exactly

2880.44 --> 2886.4
how it works it's just the programming

2883.4 --> 2886.4
Parts going to be a

2888.76 --> 2895.3190000000004
chore I need somebody that's really good

2892.92 --> 2897.48
with codes that I could say like yeah

2895.319 --> 2900.5589999999997
this and that and they would like

2897.48 --> 2904.44
immediately like oh okay so that's how

2900.559 --> 2906.76
this is how I would like do that in

2904.44 --> 2909.0
code I'm I mean if they were really

2906.76 --> 2911.3590000000004
quick with that dude have one of those

2909.0 --> 2913.52
guys and we could

2911.359 --> 2917.68
like maybe

2913.52 --> 2922.0
program the game like very

2917.68 --> 2923.5589999999997
quick that way cuz I really know how

2922.0 --> 2927.28
it's supposed to be

2923.559 --> 2931.76
working if somebody really

2927.28 --> 2934.0
knows like quickly what code to use and

2931.76 --> 2935.8390000000004
can make it work and has oversight over

2934.0 --> 2938.0
complications when you combine certain C

2935.839 --> 2941.799
codes and bigger systems

2938.0 --> 2944.799
Etc then it could work very quickly

2941.799 --> 2946.88
relatively for making it computer game

2944.799 --> 2951.48
because computer games always take a lot

2946.88 --> 2951.48
of time to make even the simple

2956.2 --> 2963.1189999999997
ones do I want my game to be

2959.24 --> 2967.839
spe well duper look the point is I

2963.119 --> 2969.4
really wanted the game to be flexible

2967.839 --> 2973.24
enough

2969.4 --> 2977.119
because I it's like I just want

2973.24 --> 2977.1189999999997
everybody to be able to get

2978.4 --> 2984.52
it I I don't want to make it as like a

2981.119 --> 2989.839
cash cow or anything I

2984.52 --> 2992.88
want I want just I want to reinvigorate

2989.839 --> 2996.0
the love for like B Dash puzzle

2992.88 --> 2998.48
games I want to reinvigorate it and and

2996.0 --> 3000.559
I want it basically programmed in a way

2998.48 --> 3003.559
that people could literally put it on

3000.559 --> 3006.7200000000003
their mobile phone in any direction on

3003.559 --> 3008.799
their PC on their apple on their mobile

3006.72 --> 3010.9599999999996
phone

3008.799 --> 3013.44
anywhere that's kind of what I hope to

3010.96 --> 3017.559
be as

3013.44 --> 3017.559
broadly interface as

3024.44 --> 3028.68
possible

3026.16 --> 3030.799
and I don't know what what is I mean I

3028.68 --> 3033.68
am not up to date on programming

3030.799 --> 3033.68
languages and their

3036.64 --> 3043.96
flexibility but yeah I mean considering

3041.599 --> 3046.48
like everybody's mobile or most mobiles

3043.96 --> 3050.079
these days work on Android or something

3046.48 --> 3050.079
it's important that it would work on

3050.359 --> 3057.5989999999997
Android cuz I mean the game is very suit

3054.48 --> 3060.319
should be very suit suitable to play on

3057.599 --> 3060.319
just a little

3061.799 --> 3066.28
screen and that's majority of people

3064.44 --> 3068.92
these days

3066.28 --> 3072.6800000000003
anyway right majority of people have

3068.92 --> 3076.52
mobiles now smartphones and not PCS they

3072.68 --> 3076.52
might have a PC like at work or

3077.2 --> 3083.359
something but more people just have

3080.359 --> 3083.359
mobiles

3084.359 --> 3087.359
anyway

3092.839 --> 3095.92
what are you guys talking

3096.52 --> 3100.4
about right but duper yeah if you really

3099.24 --> 3103.4799999999996
want

3100.4 --> 3105.64
to want to get involved somehow want if

3103.48 --> 3108.0
you're really serious like you're going

3105.64 --> 3111.48
to have to contact me on Skype I'm going

3108.0 --> 3116.839
to have to like know who you are

3111.48 --> 3119.2
then you can't just be a name in a chat

3116.839 --> 3121.319
if you're going to like if you really

3119.2 --> 3123.5589999999997
want to cooperate with a big project

3121.319 --> 3123.5589999999997
like

3125.92 --> 3130.319
that yeah and I will keep things

3130.359 --> 3134.5989999999997
private just going to dox you or

3132.44 --> 3137.7200000000003
anything you don't have to worry about

3134.599 --> 3139.839
that I'm just glad that somebody like

3137.72 --> 3144.2
wants to offer to

3139.839 --> 3144.2
help so

3144.28 --> 3147.28
anyway

3160.44 --> 3163.92
are you talking about more crazy

3166.76 --> 3170.599
temperatures I think the callest that

3168.96 --> 3173.319
I've ever lived through here in the

3170.599 --> 3177.2400000000002
Netherlands was like minus5

3173.319 --> 3179.68
cels on a very cool winter I did not

3177.24 --> 3179.68
like that

3182.04 --> 3190.68
winter cuz it was like one of

3186.2 --> 3192.9199999999996
those like bitter cold and so terribly

3190.68 --> 3197.5989999999997
windy all the time there was like this

3192.92 --> 3199.4
icy this ice saw wind like all the time

3197.599 --> 3202.079
it was

3199.4 --> 3206.079
horrendous like being outside was like

3202.079 --> 3208.8390000000004
literally like painful like no I don't

3206.079 --> 3208.8390000000004
want to go

3212.2 --> 3218.839
outside Das nothing

3215.04 --> 3218.839
Sprites for the player

3219.319 --> 3222.319
character

3230.24 --> 3236.7599999999998
uh are you

3232.76 --> 3240.3190000000004
sure I don't know about that duper

3236.76 --> 3242.7200000000003
I don't think like other than Graphics I

3240.319 --> 3244.52
don't know if they actually use right

3242.72 --> 3247.48
the whole thing about B Dash is that

3244.52 --> 3251.04
it's kind of character based it always

3247.48 --> 3253.2400000000002
used characters and not

3251.04 --> 3256.24
Sprites I don't know if that language

3253.24 --> 3260.2799999999997
even still applies that's a division

3256.24 --> 3262.0
thing of how like what what how it works

3260.28 --> 3263.88
how it used to work at least on a comer

3262.0 --> 3265.88
is like there's the characters things

3263.88 --> 3269.0
that can't move around and then there's

3265.88 --> 3271.96
the Sprites they can basically free move

3269.0 --> 3271.96
independently on the

3272.119 --> 3279.359
screen well bulad Dash is a rigid grid

3276.72 --> 3281.72
there is no free moving on the

3279.359 --> 3284.52
screen there's no independent free

3281.72 --> 3288.319
movement on the screen it's a rigid grid

3284.52 --> 3291.839
things only exist within the

3288.319 --> 3293.799
squares there's no in between so I don't

3291.839 --> 3295.799
think there's any Sprites duper if there

3293.799 --> 3297.599
would be any Sprites

3295.799 --> 3300.7599999999998
it would just be

3297.599 --> 3303.28
Graphics because hey there can be and I

3300.76 --> 3306.0400000000004
had planned this two layers to the game

3303.28 --> 3306.0400000000004
you have the

3306.88 --> 3312.04
grid everything sticks to that it it

3309.72 --> 3314.359
will have basic Graphics like

3312.04 --> 3316.2799999999997
character-based Graphics very simple

3314.359 --> 3318.2
still

3316.28 --> 3322.88
things

3318.2 --> 3326.5989999999997
and then you could have a layer over

3322.88 --> 3329.6400000000003
that of graphics so that an explosion

3326.599 --> 3333.92
doesn't just look like nine times

3329.64 --> 3337.92
like a thingy but actually like a

3333.92 --> 3341.48
fireball explosion that's like on top of

3337.92 --> 3345.2000000000003
the background Graphics right like

3341.48 --> 3348.4
Graphics layer on top of it Sprites

3345.2 --> 3350.799
would probably be used for

3348.4 --> 3353.799
that because that's exactly what a

3350.799 --> 3356.28
Sprite does independently over the top

3353.799 --> 3357.92
of everything right so yeah Sprites

3356.28 --> 3360.4
could probably be used but it would

3357.92 --> 3363.079
mostly be an afterthought for the

3360.4 --> 3366.2400000000002
animation part which is

3363.079 --> 3369.52
like not the main function of the game

3366.24 --> 3372.5589999999997
like it could literally function without

3369.52 --> 3375.319
that it would look really simple

3372.559 --> 3380.4
though not much to look

3375.319 --> 3381.96
at so yeah duper I yeah it's kind of

3380.4 --> 3383.6800000000003
funny that you're bringing that I have

3381.96 --> 3386.92
really thought out the details it's all

3383.68 --> 3386.9199999999996
in there so

3391.839 --> 3396.96
no yeah don't have to tell me what a

3394.319 --> 3399.119
Sprite is duper I've known what a Sprite

3396.96 --> 3402.119
is when you weren't even born

3399.119 --> 3402.119
yet

3402.48 --> 3408.2
literally like when I was seven I knew

3405.44 --> 3408.2000000000003
what his Sprite

3413.88 --> 3416.88
was

3428.96 --> 3434.28
so you don't need Sprites to see an

3432.72 --> 3439.16
object in a

3434.28 --> 3443.799
game not if you use characters passive

3439.16 --> 3446.799
things that don't or unable to move

3443.799 --> 3446.799
around

3447.0 --> 3450.119
that's how Bula Dash

3451.64 --> 3457.48
worked yeah you're it's like not a

3454.839 --> 3461.4
Sprite moving around over the

3457.48 --> 3465.28
screen it's you're the unit that square

3461.4 --> 3468.0
is you if you push to that direction

3465.28 --> 3470.799
that square stops being you and then the

3468.0 --> 3472.599
other Square becomes you and that's how

3470.799 --> 3475.0
it moves it's character to character

3472.599 --> 3478.88
it's not a thing that's like moving in

3475.0 --> 3481.4
between squares no it's a grit system it

3478.88 --> 3484.44
doesn't need Sprite

3481.4 --> 3487.6800000000003
duper it's not how that system

3484.44 --> 3490.88
works it doesn't need

3487.68 --> 3492.64
that yeah it's not a video game where

3490.88 --> 3495.1600000000003
you're like a little figure and you're

3492.64 --> 3497.5589999999997
walking around and you're like oh oh oh

3495.16 --> 3499.7599999999998
I haven't gone right around the corner

3497.559 --> 3501.92
just yet yeah that's a Sprite because

3499.76 --> 3504.559
the Sprite can move in between the grid

3501.92 --> 3505.28
and it can like one pixel to the side

3504.559 --> 3508.079
yeah

3505.28 --> 3511.6800000000003
that doesn't happen in Bull Dash ever

3508.079 --> 3514.1600000000003
it's all on the grid this Grid or the

3511.68 --> 3516.3999999999996
one beside it there's no in between this

3514.16 --> 3519.64
one or that one that's how bullet Dash

3516.4 --> 3519.64
Works no

3526.359 --> 3529.359
Sprites

3529.4 --> 3536.7200000000003
anyway sorry to bore to death with

3533.72 --> 3536.72
that

3537.96 --> 3541.839
you're confused yeah I bet you

3543.96 --> 3549.28
are and by that I can tell that you're

3546.92 --> 3554.0
probably not going to end up programming

3549.28 --> 3554.0
bull Dash with me if this confuses

3554.079 --> 3558.88
you oh well thanks for offering

3562.12 --> 3566.64
[Music]

3563.64 --> 3566.64
though

3582.039 --> 3587.8390000000004
you're confused look

3585.0 --> 3592.039
loer think about Sprites think what they

3587.839 --> 3595.64
do in games yeah what were Sprites for

3592.039 --> 3599.48
free moving so you have the background

3595.64 --> 3601.799
like grass a bunch of trees a stone

3599.48 --> 3604.16
whatever think of Zelda you know the

3601.799 --> 3606.799
background guess what the background it

3604.16 --> 3608.68
can scroll visually but the things on

3606.799 --> 3610.119
the background don't move around because

3608.68 --> 3614.52
if something is moving around has a

3610.119 --> 3618.48
little animation they use a Sprite for

3614.52 --> 3622.799
that because if something is

3618.48 --> 3625.2400000000002
moving pixel per pixel it cannot be the

3622.799 --> 3627.4
background it cannot be a character it

3625.24 --> 3629.7599999999998
has to be a

3627.4 --> 3632.44
right right so if you have a game where

3629.76 --> 3635.44
there's for example hit

3632.44 --> 3639.319
detection that works with pixels so it's

3635.44 --> 3642.599
like oh you have your little car your

3639.319 --> 3645.0
little man whatever in pixels and oh you

3642.599 --> 3646.76
have the wall and it's like oh almost

3645.0 --> 3647.68
hit the wall but not yet you're safe and

3646.76 --> 3652.48
then it's

3647.68 --> 3655.44
like the pixel of your Sprite hit the

3652.48 --> 3657.079
hit detection thing and now you're

3655.44 --> 3661.559
something happens in the game yeah

3657.079 --> 3664.2400000000002
that's Sprite stuff that never ever

3661.559 --> 3667.3590000000004
happens in B Dash there's no hit

3664.24 --> 3669.72
detection there's only is something

3667.359 --> 3673.48
that's going to make you explode in the

3669.72 --> 3675.68
GD block directly next to you there's no

3673.48 --> 3678.079
pixel stuff there's no hit detection

3675.68 --> 3680.24
nothing it's just you're there or you're

3678.079 --> 3682.2400000000002
right next to there and that's it now

3680.24 --> 3686.4399999999996
those are the places you can be there's

3682.24 --> 3686.4399999999996
no in between you can be

3686.76 --> 3691.6800000000003
no

3688.319 --> 3693.7599999999998
Sprites except maybe for visual

3691.68 --> 3696.0
animations

3693.76 --> 3700.44
afterwards hope somebody can still

3696.0 --> 3700.44
follow this probably

3709.4 --> 3716.44
not Bal

3712.4 --> 3716.44
Das yeah that's different

3719.799 --> 3725.52
Collision yes Collision hit detection

3722.599 --> 3729.6800000000003
Collision yeah it's the

3725.52 --> 3732.0
same right so Collision only happens

3729.68 --> 3732.0
with

3736.359 --> 3742.319
Sprites right because a character can't

3740.64 --> 3745.319
move

3742.319 --> 3748.68
around it's either here or it isn't

3745.319 --> 3751.52
there it might be there if if the system

3748.68 --> 3755.5589999999997
allows it to do that but it's not going

3751.52 --> 3758.119
to be in between it's definitely here or

3755.559 --> 3760.52
there and that's how bulad Dash works

3758.119 --> 3763.559
there's no in between no Sprites

3760.52 --> 3768.0389999999998
necessary right and it'll save a lot

3763.559 --> 3771.92
of processing power too because

3768.039 --> 3774.1600000000003
Sprites like that's another process

3771.92 --> 3777.319
ready the more of them there are the

3774.16 --> 3781.0389999999998
more more clogged up the game becomes

3777.319 --> 3784.52
slows down Etc it doesn't happen with

3781.039 --> 3786.119
characters that's why you have gigantic

3784.52 --> 3788.559
boulder dash

3786.119 --> 3790.319
levels that still function with

3788.559 --> 3792.48
complicated things all happening at the

3790.319 --> 3795.319
same time even outside of you and it

3792.48 --> 3797.599
still works why because it isn't all

3795.319 --> 3801.359
just Sprites if it was all Sprites it

3797.599 --> 3804.7200000000003
would immediately freeze and crash its

3801.359 --> 3807.2
characters CU everything is perfect

3804.72 --> 3811.5589999999997
stuck to its

3807.2 --> 3811.5589999999997
grid and that makes it very

3815.72 --> 3820.9599999999996
efficient no duper you don't know what

3818.16 --> 3820.96
the hell you're talking

3833.279 --> 3836.279
about

3837.559 --> 3841.7200000000003
now you clearly don't know what you're

3839.44 --> 3848.079
talking about duper

3841.72 --> 3848.0789999999997
Sprites are intrinsically tied into

3849.599 --> 3855.839
Collision like these are like the things

3852.68 --> 3859.359
that I actually did learn like about

3855.839 --> 3862.0789999999997
computers when I was seven mostly for my

3859.359 --> 3865.0789999999997
brother CU he was very interested in

3862.079 --> 3869.2400000000002
these developments at the time you

3865.079 --> 3872.279
Sprites a Sprite a free

3869.24 --> 3875.0
floating thing separate of the

3872.279 --> 3877.24
background was a revolutionary new

3875.0 --> 3879.0
invention on the computer to have that

3877.24 --> 3881.0789999999997
it was

3879.0 --> 3882.92
revolutionary and at first it was like

3881.079 --> 3884.88
wow yeah we can have like eight Sprites

3882.92 --> 3888.839
at the same time on

3884.88 --> 3891.2000000000003
screen and then the Commodore was like

3888.839 --> 3892.799
yeah we can do that too and then a bunch

3891.2 --> 3895.8799999999997
of hackers figured out like yeah but we

3892.799 --> 3899.079
can also do 16 it still works like what

3895.88 --> 3901.2400000000002
really yeah and we can do like 64 but it

3899.079 --> 3903.039
slows down but it's still possible yeah

3901.24 --> 3906.64
but it shouldn't be possible yeah but it

3903.039 --> 3909.2000000000003
is we figured out how to do it even

3906.64 --> 3911.24
though it's not supposed to work yeah

3909.2 --> 3913.64
that's how I know about Sprites with the

3911.24 --> 3913.64
comer

3923.079 --> 3926.079
64

3928.0 --> 3931.559
that that doesn't mean anything

3934.52 --> 3937.52
duper

3939.039 --> 3943.76
whatever

3941.2 --> 3946.7599999999998
yeah but I'm not going to tell you again

3943.76 --> 3948.88
though yeah it's all cool Sprite yeah no

3946.76 --> 3951.88
very in very important in video game

3948.88 --> 3954.7200000000003
yeah I'm sure yeah not in bullet Dash

3951.88 --> 3956.6800000000003
though except for

3954.72 --> 3958.72
Graphics

3956.68 --> 3961.0389999999998
afterthought yeah that that's how it

3958.72 --> 3963.9199999999996
works that's how this game is going to

3961.039 --> 3967.2400000000002
work you

3963.92 --> 3970.319
understand what I do not need is a

3967.24 --> 3973.7599999999998
programmer that has their own Vision on

3970.319 --> 3977.92
how they think this game should

3973.76 --> 3981.2000000000003
work yeah that's what I do not need

3977.92 --> 3985.039
do cuz it's only going to work one

3981.2 --> 3987.0789999999997
way and that's this way how bll Dash

3985.039 --> 3991.039
Works how it's always

3987.079 --> 3996.0
worked if you program it another way

3991.039 --> 3996.0
then it fails it doesn't work

4004.88 --> 4007.88
then

4013.0 --> 4016.0
anyhow

4020.92 --> 4027.2400000000002
I want to talk about the rest is talking

4022.76 --> 4027.2400000000002
about Shing your Sprites

4037.88 --> 4043.6400000000003
what it's really funny when you think

4040.44 --> 4044.599
about like Sprites because Sprite is

4043.64 --> 4046.8799999999997
like a

4044.599 --> 4049.88
pixie it's like a

4046.88 --> 4051.7200000000003
magical little thing and that's how they

4049.88 --> 4053.279
regard it it's like yeah it's magical

4051.72 --> 4056.359
it's just this piece of Graphics that

4053.279 --> 4058.119
can just move around independently of

4056.359 --> 4059.359
anything that's like it's just going to

4058.119 --> 4061.92
move over

4059.359 --> 4063.359
things and that was magical back then so

4061.92 --> 4065.799
it's like yeah it's a

4063.359 --> 4069.359
right it's like we suddenly got free

4065.799 --> 4069.359
wondering Graphics all of a

4072.92 --> 4075.92
sudden

4077.799 --> 4082.599
you don't need to see the carrot what

4079.839 --> 4082.599
are you talking

4083.88 --> 4089.559
about it's a puzzle game the character

4087.359 --> 4091.48
that is your charact your player

4089.559 --> 4096.2390000000005
character is going to be at the center

4091.48 --> 4098.679
of the screen you do see him you just

4096.239 --> 4101.639999999999
don't

4098.679 --> 4103.359
it's just like have you ever seen bul

4101.64 --> 4106.0
the dash have you ever seen a bul the

4103.359 --> 4109.799
Dash game any

4106.0 --> 4112.48
yeah they only exist on the

4109.799 --> 4115.679
grd there's no in between there might be

4112.48 --> 4117.639999999999
an animation of it walking o certainly

4115.679 --> 4119.56
oh it walks from this to that but

4117.64 --> 4123.400000000001
technically that doesn't exist because

4119.56 --> 4125.719
it can't stop walking in between the

4123.4 --> 4128.3589999999995
Grid it's just an

4125.719 --> 4130.64
animation to make it seem like it's

4128.359 --> 4134.08
moving what it's actually happening is

4130.64 --> 4136.88
it's it's right here and now it's it's

4134.08 --> 4140.2789999999995
there it wasn't in between it wasn't

4136.88 --> 4143.799
nowhere anywhere it was there or there

4140.279 --> 4145.88
and that's how that grit system works

4143.799 --> 4148.239
then how you show it with the animation

4145.88 --> 4150.279
is all

4148.239 --> 4151.879999999999
secondary if you really want to get it

4150.279 --> 4155.88
you're going to have to like watch

4151.88 --> 4158.2390000000005
really old buou Dash like from Old

4155.88 --> 4160.679
Computers who didn't have funky

4158.239 --> 4164.12
animation stuff it was all character

4160.679 --> 4167.12
based very basic Graphics in which you

4164.12 --> 4171.0
could see that grid because everything

4167.12 --> 4174.599999999999
literally only existed within the grid

4171.0 --> 4177.359
there visually so that you can see

4174.6 --> 4179.359
what's really happening instead of being

4177.359 --> 4181.839
distracted by all kinds of animations

4179.359 --> 4185.719
that cover that

4181.839 --> 4188.839
up remind me of dig duck yeah but dig

4185.719 --> 4192.159
duck funnily enough was Sprite based you

4188.839 --> 4195.48
see with dick dug it didn't hold to any

4192.159 --> 4198.0
Grid at all you could Dig Dug and then

4195.48 --> 4201.879999999999
like oh I'm going to go like three

4198.0 --> 4204.48
pixels down and then go to the side yeah

4201.88 --> 4207.56
that was kind of weird about

4204.48 --> 4209.44
digdug and that is not how it works in

4207.56 --> 4211.92
bullet Dash because in bullet Dash you

4209.44 --> 4216.08
can't dig three pixels

4211.92 --> 4218.6
down you dig one block down two blocks

4216.08 --> 4222.0
down no in

4218.6 --> 4224.92
between cuz it's not Sprite based digdug

4222.0 --> 4226.92
is Sprite based

4224.92 --> 4231.88
bulad Dash is

4226.92 --> 4236.64
not dig dog has very small levels that

4231.88 --> 4240.32
fit on the screen every time bulad Dash

4236.64 --> 4243.280000000001
has huge levels that definitely don't

4240.32 --> 4246.96
fit on the screen why does it have huge

4243.28 --> 4249.639999999999
levels because it can because it's not

4246.96 --> 4252.64
made with

4249.64 --> 4254.88
Sprites because if it was all Sprites it

4252.64 --> 4257.719
would immediately make the computer

4254.88 --> 4261.679
crash because it's way too much data it

4257.719 --> 4266.6
has to continually be processing doesn't

4261.679 --> 4266.6
fit like it would make a modern computer

4267.12 --> 4274.32
crash or at least like way

4270.8 --> 4276.88
overloaded like irrationally burn it out

4274.32 --> 4279.96
cuz it's not how that game works it

4276.88 --> 4283.2390000000005
works with characters not with Sprites

4279.96 --> 4285.6
final I don't know how many in how many

4283.239 --> 4290.759999999999
different ways I need to keep explaining

4285.6 --> 4294.84
this before it's definitively

4290.76 --> 4294.84
understood I know what I'm talking

4299.239 --> 4303.959999999999
about you just watch a video bu Dash

4301.719 --> 4303.96
yeah

4309.36 --> 4316.5599999999995
cool that's

4312.56 --> 4318.8
good should play bades seems familiar

4316.56 --> 4321.52
yeah but it was very popular and they

4318.8 --> 4325.360000000001
and there like bulles still going dig

4321.52 --> 4326.2390000000005
dog is not dig dog is like an 80s game I

4325.36 --> 4330.679
played

4326.239 --> 4331.799999999999
it on my brother's Schneider the green

4330.679 --> 4335.0
black

4331.8 --> 4337.56
screen it was fun

4335.0 --> 4339.28
though but everything back then was fun

4337.56 --> 4342.719
if it was

4339.28 --> 4345.599999999999
moving on a computer screen anything

4342.719 --> 4347.84
that had Fri was fun back then when I

4345.6 --> 4347.84
was

4351.08 --> 4356.5199999999995
little I did like play dig duck in like

4353.96 --> 4360.56
a simulator thing what is it like five

4356.52 --> 4360.56
years ago it was really

4369.6 --> 4375.719
lame to play Cafe down to that's sounds

4381.52 --> 4387.120000000001
hilarious right but dig dog is kind of

4384.32 --> 4388.96
like oh a creature oh let's blow it up

4387.12 --> 4391.84
next no the next creature oh don't get

4388.96 --> 4395.199
caught yeah bul the dash is like no this

4391.84 --> 4398.08
is a very serious puzzle game and the

4395.199 --> 4401.32
puzzle game could be random like it's

4398.08 --> 4403.88
surreal it the game does give you like

4401.32 --> 4406.36
claustrophobia at times

4403.88 --> 4408.88
like for real it's like it it really

4406.36 --> 4408.88
gets to

4411.8 --> 4415.12
you f

4432.36 --> 4435.36
you

4447.639 --> 4454.6
right right but what bull Dash really

4451.12 --> 4456.92
did do is like challenge you cuz there

4454.6 --> 4459.56
were levels that were just like you

4456.92 --> 4462.4800000000005
couldn't figure out how to how to finish

4459.56 --> 4464.639
it and like could really like ah why

4462.48 --> 4466.919999999999
don't I know this level I get to this

4464.639 --> 4470.08
level every time why can't I figure it

4466.92 --> 4472.2390000000005
out but then if you did figure it out it

4470.08 --> 4474.8
was like

4472.239 --> 4478.04
whoa then were you're like oh my God now

4474.8 --> 4478.04
I can see the levels

4478.36 --> 4484.5199999999995
Beyond I mean yeah and that was just

4481.76 --> 4488.159000000001
basic bll the Dash without even super

4484.52 --> 4491.679
complicated puzzle like designed

4488.159 --> 4494.719
levels the more random type levels but

4491.679 --> 4496.96
it was a massive challenge

4494.719 --> 4499.76
like they were very challenging

4496.96 --> 4502.639
games so simple so challenging and

4499.76 --> 4505.88
that's great I mean that's bul the dash

4502.639 --> 4508.6
there is no other game like it it really

4505.88 --> 4513.32
is like a pinnacle puzzle game I

4508.6 --> 4515.76
consider bul the dash to be like Tetris

4513.32 --> 4518.639
except Tetris was super popularized

4515.76 --> 4522.56
everybody knows Tetris everybody should

4518.639 --> 4524.159000000001
know bul Dash because it is that good

4522.56 --> 4528.04
the game is that

4524.159 --> 4530.759999999999
good the potential of the game is

4528.04 --> 4533.4
enormous way bigger than what Tetris can

4530.76 --> 4535.6
do Tetris just really fun and simple and

4533.4 --> 4535.599999999999
it

4537.04 --> 4542.96
worked and it was ideal for a Game Boy

4540.08 --> 4547.04
and that's what made it work so great

4542.96 --> 4550.639
boulder dash is really like one of the

4547.04 --> 4555.199
best games of that time for how

4550.639 --> 4555.1990000000005
functional it was how simple it worked

4556.52 --> 4564.56
that little G the tetris kills

4560.88 --> 4564.56
what what are you talking

4570.4 --> 4573.5599999999995
about all

4577.44 --> 4585.04

younger it's except that I'm not that

4654.159 --> 4659.08
young and impulsive

4656.36 --> 4660.48
anymore but I mean like 20 years ago

4659.08 --> 4662.8
like I would have been his best friend

4660.48 --> 4665.759999999999
or something

4662.8 --> 4668.639
maybe right but yeah and the other girl

4665.76 --> 4673.1990000000005

4668.639 --> 4675.36
like a real woman type of girl and like

4673.199 --> 4677.719
she has an awesome family then they're

4675.36 --> 4677.719
really

4678.92 --> 4686.08
tight and

4681.32 --> 4689.0
yeah she's very nice I I kind of like

4686.08 --> 4690.679
her and I'm like yesterday I like really

4689.0 --> 4693.719
like for the first time like had a bit

4690.679 --> 4695.719
of a conversation like yeah I'm kind of

4693.719 --> 4699.28
jealous of your family you guys seem so

4695.719 --> 4702.199
tight and my family is all blown up and

4699.28 --> 4704.159
proceeded to tell a summarized version

4702.199 --> 4708.4
of how all that

4704.159 --> 4708.4
went tried not to end too

4708.84 --> 4713.76
depressing but yeah I'm very happy with

4711.84 --> 4715.92
the new

4713.76 --> 4720.280000000001
roommates feels like it's going to be a

4715.92 --> 4720.28
very good year here in here at

4723.32 --> 4728.12
least mention Tetris Tetris skill I

4726.36 --> 4731.0
don't know what that is Woodwork and gy

4728.12 --> 4731.0
bear I've never heard of

4731.92 --> 4734.92
that

4751.6 --> 4756.56
just saying Tetris because of the

4753.76 --> 4758.8
popularity at the time I mean every

4756.56 --> 4762.04
freaking person in the world that knows

4758.8 --> 4764.84
what a computer is knows what Tetris is

4762.04 --> 4764.84
at this point

4765.0 --> 4769.44
I'm kind of surprised that Tetris isn't

4767.199 --> 4770.919999999999
just like a standard game that can be

4769.44 --> 4773.759999999999
found in like

4770.92 --> 4779.04
every operating

4773.76 --> 4781.400000000001
system like bamon and wine sweeper why

4779.04 --> 4785.239
isn't Tetris just a standard thing in

4781.4 --> 4788.159
there like at this point shouldn't it be

4785.239 --> 4792.28
just like oh yeah Tetris

4788.159 --> 4794.839999999999
because I mean really why isn't it just

4792.28 --> 4794.84
standard

4799.92 --> 4807.2390000000005
kill screen is the point where a game

4801.6 --> 4807.2390000000005
crashed because it isn't oh oh okay

4809.36 --> 4813.92
right yeah you're talking about like the

4811.719 --> 4816.32
early Tetris

4813.92 --> 4818.96
right where they basically didn't even

4816.32 --> 4818.96
finish the

4820.0 --> 4825.52
program but haven't they like updated it

4823.199 --> 4825.5199999999995
since

4835.76 --> 4841.1990000000005
then I mean not the old cartridges

4838.36 --> 4843.36
probably but I don't know right but I've

4841.199 --> 4844.5599999999995
heard about that that it was basically

4843.36 --> 4847.5199999999995
just not

4844.56 --> 4850.2390000000005
finished that it was rushed on the

4847.52 --> 4852.1990000000005
market and that if you were getting

4850.239 --> 4855.36
really good at it that you would indeed

4852.199 --> 4857.759999999999
like it would would just

4855.36 --> 4858.839999999999
break the game would crash I've heard

4857.76 --> 4863.08
that

4858.84 --> 4863.08
yeah never actually seen it

4865.639 --> 4871.12
though okay what the hell am I going to

4868.44 --> 4871.12
go Today's

4881.639 --> 4886.08
Show

4884.32 --> 4889.12
the original Tetris not the millennial

4886.08 --> 4889.12
vers right

4895.88 --> 4900.679
exactly never been done

4903.92 --> 4908.28
really okay well I must have picked that

4906.12 --> 4910.28
up on a dark World Vision then because

4908.28 --> 4911.639
it seems to make perfect sense that that

4910.28 --> 4914.48
was

4911.639 --> 4917.04
there it's like

4914.48 --> 4919.199
yeah but to be fair I can't really

4917.04 --> 4920.96
remember where I got that information

4919.199 --> 4922.599999999999
from so it could literally be like

4920.96 --> 4925.6
something that was told to me in the

4922.6 --> 4928.2390000000005
dark world I get in Dark World I had

4925.6 --> 4929.84
like tons and tons and tons of heads up

4928.239 --> 4931.36
about things like oh this and that oh

4929.84 --> 4936.08
this and that this and that this and

4931.36 --> 4939.36
that it's just I don't know when or

4936.08 --> 4943.4
where it's like yeah I got all the data

4939.36 --> 4946.5599999999995
I just it's just not filed properly it's

4943.4 --> 4950.799999999999
all just a giant pile of

4946.56 --> 4954.2390000000005
stuff and you just have to recognize

4950.8 --> 4954.2390000000005
it and get

4955.44 --> 4960.839999999999
lucky no not from The Ether shut up ww

4958.56 --> 4960.84
can go

4961.6 --> 4965.84
anywhere but seriously now that I was

4964.04 --> 4967.239
told oh going a kill screen I'm like

4965.84 --> 4969.719
yeah yeah

4967.239 --> 4971.959999999999
duh what you didn't know

4969.719 --> 4974.84
that and then you're saying like oh yeah

4971.96 --> 4978.84
it was just recently like

4974.84 --> 4982.679
what but why do does it feel like I've

4978.84 --> 4986.719
known that for 20 years then oh oh Dark

4982.679 --> 4986.719
World okay that makes

5001.48 --> 5004.48
sense

5054.78 --> 5058.32
[Music]

5056.6 --> 5060.360000000001
come on guys help me out what am I going

5058.32 --> 5062.84
to call this

5060.36 --> 5065.92
show I think I'm going to like mention

5062.84 --> 5065.92
about Sprites and

5091.36 --> 5095.509999999999
characters

5092.45 --> 5095.51
[Music]

5121.28 --> 5124.28

5136.679 --> 5140.679
okay this is kind of weird but that's

5138.639 --> 5141.8
what I'm going to call it now characters

5140.679 --> 5146.4400000000005
stay

5141.8 --> 5146.4400000000005
grounded Sprites move around

5147.88 --> 5153.28
freely that's funny because people can

5150.96 --> 5156.52
now like just try try to guess what the

5153.28 --> 5159.759999999999
hell I'm even talking about with that

5156.52 --> 5159.76
title that's

5163.04 --> 5169.56
fun anybody notice that Constantine hell

5166.88 --> 5169.56
was

5171.0 --> 5174.0
name

5181.199 --> 5184.199
what

5185.6 --> 5189.84
I don't remember woodworking gy

5196.56 --> 5202.4800000000005
Bear right but I mean yeah I've been

5199.92 --> 5205.679
hearing more about that I I wasn't aware

5202.48 --> 5208.44
that Mark Sergeant was such a fervent

5205.679 --> 5211.28
simulation theorist I mean he actually

5208.44 --> 5214.199
thinks that this is like a matrix video

5211.28 --> 5214.199
game projection

5215.119 --> 5221.159
I didn't know he took it that

5217.119 --> 5221.159
literal I just think it's kind of

5221.84 --> 5227.159000000001
Similator I don't think we're like it's

5224.76 --> 5229.360000000001
like a real full-on simulation I think

5227.159 --> 5230.44
it's like more like a suppression field

5229.36 --> 5232.92
that's

5230.44 --> 5236.36
happening and that suppression field

5232.92 --> 5236.36
changes our entire

5237.0 --> 5243.52
perspective of our

5239.28 --> 5248.759999999999
being and binds us to this linearity

5243.52 --> 5253.52
thing right so in a way you to the

5248.76 --> 5253.52
spirit the physical world is like a

5254.0 --> 5261.32
simulation but the

5258.0 --> 5265.48
spirit like it there is

5261.32 --> 5267.679
no over thing there is no other thing

5265.48 --> 5269.879999999999
though than the simulation that's why I

5267.679 --> 5271.679
call it Similator right because there's

5269.88 --> 5273.719
the simulation and then there's the

5271.679 --> 5276.119
spirit world the inner

5273.719 --> 5279.199
world there's no material in the inner

5276.119 --> 5283.239
world there's nothing to reflect upon in

5279.199 --> 5287.44
the inner world except for the ideas

5283.239 --> 5289.718999999999
attained from the material yeah whatever

5287.44 --> 5292.879999999999
you're going to be seeing in any dream

5289.719 --> 5296.76
in any Vision in any hallucination it's

5292.88 --> 5300.56
all going to be things that have been

5296.76 --> 5305.96
founded that have been conceived of

5300.56 --> 5305.96
envisioned Within the material realm

5306.0 --> 5311.44
experience yeah and that's where I

5309.0 --> 5313.04
really differ with Mark Sergeant because

5311.44 --> 5314.919999999999
yeah if you say oh it's a simulation

5313.04 --> 5317.639
then oh turn off the simulation you're

5314.92 --> 5319.8
in the real world yeah I don't think

5317.639 --> 5323.159000000001
there is the real

5319.8 --> 5325.4400000000005
world like this the simulation is the

5323.159 --> 5325.44
real

5331.0 --> 5335.199
world

5332.76 --> 5337.4800000000005
that's a very sloppy way of saying it

5335.199 --> 5341.08
but that's why I call it

5337.48 --> 5344.36
Similator like a simulation like how we

5341.08 --> 5347.639
would understand a simulation to be

5344.36 --> 5349.5199999999995
except it's not simulated off anything

5347.639 --> 5353.52
it's literally something that's

5349.52 --> 5353.52
manifested where before there wasn't

5356.719 --> 5360.159
any that's the

5360.92 --> 5365.639
difference

5363.92 --> 5367.4
okay that's a very cryptic answer there

5365.639 --> 5369.8
slowmo moon buggy hello dank by the way

5367.4 --> 5369.799999999999
good to see

5381.88 --> 5389.32
you right so got a

5386.84 --> 5392.4800000000005
title before I round out I really want

5389.32 --> 5394.4
to draw attention again uh I can really

5392.48 --> 5397.239
use some support if anybody could miss

5394.4 --> 5399.5199999999995
it just little bits it is going to be

5397.239 --> 5399.5199999999995
for

5400.199 --> 5406.119
food I mean I'm good for it now

5403.119 --> 5406.119
but

5406.36 --> 5412.839999999999
like I need some supporter I'm going to

5408.84 --> 5412.84
have a very very hungry

5413.639 --> 5419.08
weekend what am I talking about it's

5415.719 --> 5420.56
Tuesday is before the weekend so please

5419.08 --> 5423.119
anybody if that you could help me out

5420.56 --> 5426.1990000000005
little bits too would be

5423.119 --> 5428.839999999999
great you I know you guys have supported

5426.199 --> 5432.32
me decently I don't want to complain

5428.84 --> 5435.76
about it too much I've managed to avoid

5432.32 --> 5440.04
most of that in the recent month and I

5435.76 --> 5442.360000000001
think that you all enjoyed me more not

5440.04 --> 5445.28
complaining about it too

5442.36 --> 5449.0
much but the fact remains is that I am

5445.28 --> 5454.4
going to run out of funds for food

5449.0 --> 5456.8
soon and that's beside the debt that's

5454.4 --> 5459.239
currently happening and I can't do

5456.8 --> 5463.4400000000005
anything about

5459.239 --> 5468.239
it but yeah I mean food you know

5463.44 --> 5470.5199999999995
that's that's just a a littleit higher

5468.239 --> 5473.4
priority anyway please support me

5470.52 --> 5475.360000000001
through the PayPal patreon too i' I've

5473.4 --> 5477.04
got a decent amount of patreons these

5475.36 --> 5480.44
days patreon

5477.04 --> 5484.239
support more would always be great I

5480.44 --> 5484.239
mean it's a monthly thing it is

5484.88 --> 5490.8
helpful and yeah hopefully I don't know

5487.44 --> 5492.96
maybe patreon could like more people

5490.8 --> 5495.8
chiping with five bucks every month and

5492.96 --> 5500.44
that will eventually like really be

5495.8 --> 5502.0
helpful it already is but still I could

5500.44 --> 5505.5599999999995
use

5502.0 --> 5508.119
more but then again who who couldn't who

5505.56 --> 5510.56
couldn't use more support

5508.119 --> 5513.759999999999
right but anyway please support me

5510.56 --> 5513.76
through PayPal PR

5519.719 --> 5525.36
preferably

5521.52 --> 5528.719
okay all the grand thing seems possible

5525.36 --> 5530.599999999999
God makes the big picture and each of

5528.719 --> 5533.32
this is interacting and adding to the

5530.6 --> 5535.320000000001
perception of the whole that's

5533.32 --> 5537.88
interesting constantly updating the

5535.32 --> 5539.96
whole right well from that perspective

5537.88 --> 5542.1990000000005
when you look it like that then the

5539.96 --> 5545.08
simulation is our conscious

5542.199 --> 5548.799999999999
like manifesting this

5545.08 --> 5552.28
world that's really trippy that does

5548.8 --> 5554.8
kind of sound like you smoked some weed

5552.28 --> 5557.599999999999
although it's more like you're a

5554.8 --> 5560.96
20-year-old that smoked some weed I mean

5557.6 --> 5563.84
I smoke some weed today and like I don't

5560.96 --> 5568.08
go trippy like

5563.84 --> 5568.08
that I did when I was younger

5570.639 --> 5574.4400000000005
though

5572.28 --> 5577.32
but no I don't I don't think that

5574.44 --> 5579.36
literally our conscious is manifesting

5577.32 --> 5582.96
the world like this I think that this

5579.36 --> 5582.96
world does

5583.36 --> 5588.28
exist and it is our

5585.76 --> 5590.88
Consciousness that allows us to

5588.28 --> 5590.88
experience

5600.56 --> 5603.56
it

5606.119 --> 5609.96
definitely in their 40s

5613.6 --> 5619.1990000000005
right to before after show yes and

5630.56 --> 5633.56
yes

5638.76 --> 5642.76
and actions become part of the whole

5640.52 --> 5645.639
right well it's still the idea that the

5642.76 --> 5648.56
Consciousness Collective or otherwise is

5645.639 --> 5651.719
constructing this reality I don't think

5648.56 --> 5654.88
so I think that that entire idea is

5651.719 --> 5657.119
super obsessive and it's like oh we're

5654.88 --> 5659.679
the gods we're creating and we're just

5657.119 --> 5662.679
looking at oh I'm so powerful oh I'm

5659.679 --> 5665.96
looking at it I'm creating it

5662.679 --> 5668.2390000000005
it's me oh I think it's ridiculous that

5665.96 --> 5670.84
idea that oh you're manifesting by

5668.239 --> 5672.599999999999
looking at it screw you dude stop being

5670.84 --> 5678.360000000001
such a megal

5672.6 --> 5681.360000000001
maniacal hippie it's stupid it's just

5678.36 --> 5681.36
lame

5681.48 --> 5688.0
yep you're not creating anything by

5684.48 --> 5691.28
looking at it you're

5688.0 --> 5693.199
just observing it I mean something might

5691.28 --> 5695.639
happen happened you creating it by

5693.199 --> 5697.599999999999
looking at yeah screw you no you're not

5695.639 --> 5701.52
God you didn't create

5697.6 --> 5704.320000000001
that you didn't manifest anything right

5701.52 --> 5706.159000000001
not you not your Consciousness like oh

5704.32 --> 5708.639
you might be part of God and then God

5706.159 --> 5712.08
did it yeah sure not you

5708.639 --> 5716.0
though not you in that

5712.08 --> 5718.32
form so just stop being so Mega Lal and

5716.0 --> 5721.04
think that you can create or manifest

5718.32 --> 5723.239
anything it's hor [ __ ] you manifest what

5721.04 --> 5727.199
you put together what you

5723.239 --> 5730.759999999999
rearrange within this created

5727.199 --> 5731.96
reality and you reassemble what God has

5730.76 --> 5736.6
made for

5731.96 --> 5740.4
us that's what we do we don't manifest

5736.6 --> 5743.84
things we manifest visions and then we

5740.4 --> 5749.36
use the material realm what was given to

5743.84 --> 5751.4400000000005
us to rearrange that and recreate our

5749.36 --> 5754.639
vision that's what we do we don't me

5751.44 --> 5754.638999999999
manifest anything

5761.4 --> 5767.32
material these things you shall do one

5764.32 --> 5767.32
more

5780.32 --> 5784.84
okay okay fair enough woodwor and gy

5782.8 --> 5786.96
bear yeah at this point it's like

5784.84 --> 5790.719
nitpicky with words

5786.96 --> 5792.0
but yes I agree we interact with

5790.719 --> 5795.119
creation

5792.0 --> 5798.08
definitely and I mean indirectly we may

5795.119 --> 5800.08
manifest but always remember you're

5798.08 --> 5803.639
you're doing it with what was given to

5800.08 --> 5806.5599999999995
you by creation by God and we were given

5803.639 --> 5809.639
to us by creation by God our

5806.56 --> 5812.679
Consciousness was given this

5809.639 --> 5815.639
body by God

5812.679 --> 5819.639
everything we get we get from God like

5815.639 --> 5822.88
that's that should be

5819.639 --> 5824.52
like in your conscience that should be

5822.88 --> 5827.04
the vantage point of your conscience in

5824.52 --> 5832.280000000001
my opinion that's the healthiest and

5827.04 --> 5832.28
most logical durable view of

5839.48 --> 5848.44
things maybe God the

5843.199 --> 5851.36
we uh bro dude if dude if we're like

5848.44 --> 5854.44
dead and in heaven or whatever who says

5851.36 --> 5856.32
that God is like no no all those spirit

5854.44 --> 5859.799999999999
that were alive yeah they can [ __ ] off

5856.32 --> 5863.759999999999
you stay in heaven I'll just do it uh

5859.8 --> 5866.4800000000005
yeah we may very well be like the guy

5863.76 --> 5869.8
who says that after you die it's only

5866.48 --> 5872.199
God that does anything I mean isn't God

5869.8 --> 5875.56
going to like tell you like yeah okay

5872.199 --> 5878.719
now you're on the other side and this is

5875.56 --> 5881.119000000001
what we actually do on the other side

5878.719 --> 5883.56
this is how I pull things together in

5881.119 --> 5885.48
the world like people always say thank

5883.56 --> 5888.159000000001
God for doing this and that well that's

5885.48 --> 5891.239
also you that you're going to do that in

5888.159 --> 5894.28
my name like I'm giving you this ability

5891.239 --> 5896.159
to even after death interact with your

5894.28 --> 5898.5199999999995
spirit with The Realm this is how it

5896.159 --> 5901.719
works you could think of yourself as

5898.52 --> 5905.280000000001
being my angel or something or my arm

5901.719 --> 5909.04
yeah that may very well happen

5905.28 --> 5912.44
right we may rejoin with God and then do

5909.04 --> 5916.08
what God does be the ones doing it for

5912.44 --> 5919.36
him who knows what happens after death

5916.08 --> 5919.36
all these things could be a

5919.56 --> 5926.280000000001
possibility just know that in this state

5923.84 --> 5929.04
with your unique individual

5926.28 --> 5930.119
Consciousness you are not God you are

5929.04 --> 5933.639
not the

5930.119 --> 5934.719
designer you didn't build that your body

5933.639 --> 5938.8
the

5934.719 --> 5938.8
world you're just

5938.96 --> 5945.639
here enjoying it having been given that

5942.48 --> 5945.638999999999
opportunity by the

5954.76 --> 5957.76
designer

5960.04 --> 5964.92
what

5962.92 --> 5966.76
what are you on about woodw and guny

5964.92 --> 5969.119
bear you're acting

5966.76 --> 5972.119000000001
weird right anyhow I'm going to run out

5969.119 --> 5974.159
the show so thanks everyone for coming I

5972.119 --> 5979.4
hope you like this show I thought it was

5974.159 --> 5981.5199999999995
fun a bit over the place but still good

5979.4 --> 5983.5199999999995
enough wonder how many people are going

5981.52 --> 5986.88
to be guessing at the title what that

5983.52 --> 5988.76
means I like that I like it when people

5986.88 --> 5992.36
actually need to make effort to figure

5988.76 --> 5995.56
out something I like doing that

5992.36 --> 5997.759999999999
right uh so thanks everyone for coming I

5995.56 --> 6000.04
hope you like this show if you did then
