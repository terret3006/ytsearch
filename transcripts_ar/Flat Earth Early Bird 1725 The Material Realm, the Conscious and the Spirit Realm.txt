little less windy thus far which is kind

103.079 --> 107.41999999999999
of nice yesterday was really just too

105.24 --> 107.42
much

108.0 --> 112.28
it's a very restless evening as well

117.18 --> 122.24000000000001
just a little bit of blue sky here and

119.399 --> 122.24
there but not much

124.92 --> 130.56
wind's still blowing my plants are all

127.5 --> 132.66
over the place I I've yeah I'm just

130.56 --> 135.18
leaving it like this

132.66 --> 137.22
seems to work

135.18 --> 140.54000000000002
at least they're not moving around from

137.22 --> 140.54
the from where they're at

143.16 --> 145.52
right

145.71 --> 151.56
[Music]

148.56 --> 151.56
hmm

155.099 --> 161.17999999999998
so hello everyone it's Wednesday the

159.26 --> 165.17999999999998
20th of

161.18 --> 165.18
September 2023

166.08 --> 172.62
temperatures probably gonna be

169.26 --> 175.5
18 degrees again maybe 20. we'll see

172.62 --> 178.58
[Music]

175.5 --> 178.58
19. okay

179.16 --> 184.28
well it says it's gonna rain we'll see

181.8 --> 184.28
about that

189.48 --> 192.92
yeah that might happen

195.9 --> 199.139
[Music]

200.94 --> 205.4
right so yeah let's start off

206.34 --> 209.4
yeah yesterday

208.44 --> 211.2
short show

209.4 --> 214.92000000000002
[Music]

211.2 --> 217.56
but man I was like

214.92 --> 220.44
not fully in control of myself and that

217.56 --> 223.44
expressed itself pretty much in

220.44 --> 226.739
that very very angry rant again to wait

223.44 --> 229.22
against whitsid a widget against the

226.739 --> 229.22
morgyle

229.739 --> 235.44
uh yeah

232.98 --> 236.7
you did actually contact me surprise

235.44 --> 240.18
surprise

236.7 --> 243.26
apparently the guy that I had added on

240.18 --> 243.26000000000002
Skype wasn't him

243.959 --> 249.78
but I mean yeah I don't know what the

246.78 --> 253.56
hell happened in that sense I thought

249.78 --> 254.58
that DD Divergent Droid I think it was

253.56 --> 257.04
him

254.58 --> 259.91900000000004
in Skype said that he was

257.04 --> 263.16
in contact with him

259.919 --> 266.28
maybe he was wrong whatever it was I

263.16 --> 269.28000000000003
basically like yeah went way over the

266.28 --> 271.55999999999995
top but went berserk and it wasn't

269.28 --> 273.84
really even meant for him

271.56 --> 277.38
even though some of the explanations I

273.84 --> 280.85999999999996
gave about well in the past people like

277.38 --> 282.06
not showing up not saying anything that

280.86 --> 285.41900000000004
was

282.06 --> 286.979
the agitation that was exaggerated

285.419 --> 289.32
basically

286.979 --> 291.59999999999997
although that is that is a real issue

289.32 --> 294.78
with me I really yeah especially when

291.6 --> 297.78000000000003
I'm in when I'm restless and [ __ ] like I

294.78 --> 300.23999999999995
don't take kindly to that sort of thing

297.78 --> 304.03999999999996
but in this case in retrospect it was

300.24 --> 304.04
probably just a misunderstanding

304.38 --> 308.88
and he probably didn't know anything

306.3 --> 310.8
about it or maybe I was right and he

308.88 --> 313.919
just kind of ignored it whatever it is

310.8 --> 316.94
he's not gonna come on my show

313.919 --> 316.94
and yeah

318.6 --> 323.40000000000003
I did actually well I called my healer

321.18 --> 325.139
before the show I'm very very glad that

323.4 --> 328.44
I did

325.139 --> 330.66
because yeah something had actually

328.44 --> 332.639
happened before the show that that I

330.66 --> 334.68
didn't bring up

332.639 --> 337.74
was just something that happened out

334.68 --> 339.84000000000003
there I bumped like I was just grocery

337.74 --> 342.06
shopping and stuff

339.84 --> 344.4
into the coffee shop and somebody was

342.06 --> 345.96
there that was like

344.4 --> 348.29999999999995
a customer

345.96 --> 349.5
that was in a super

348.3 --> 351.72
like

349.5 --> 356.419
terrible mood

351.72 --> 356.41900000000004
and he like basically yeah I mean

357.479 --> 362.639
he was super rude to me like out of

360.18 --> 364.02
nowhere and it was basically just trying

362.639 --> 366.78000000000003
to

364.02 --> 369.06
in be informative but he was just like

366.78 --> 370.5
in a nasty ass mood and he just was

369.06 --> 373.44
super rude to me

370.5 --> 375.479
and I think that literally just like

373.44 --> 378.08
knocked me

375.479 --> 380.639
my spirit out of my body in a sense that

378.08 --> 383.58
that anger

380.639 --> 385.819
basically echoed itself into what

383.58 --> 385.81899999999996
happened

386.22 --> 392.28000000000003
and I Unleashed it it became Unleashed

389.58 --> 394.919
on the morgo and once it kept going the

392.28 --> 397.44
funny thing was though that even as I

394.919 --> 399.59999999999997
was doing it I was literally like

397.44 --> 401.759
reading all the spiritual metadata of

399.6 --> 403.91900000000004
people that were in the chat because

401.759 --> 405.12
everybody was really shocked at what was

403.919 --> 408.59999999999997
happening

405.12 --> 410.88
but I could feel that and I knew like

408.6 --> 413.58000000000004
when that was happening like oh [ __ ]

410.88 --> 415.319
something's wrong

413.58 --> 418.8
but

415.319 --> 421.259
I just tried to turn it into a

418.8 --> 425.34000000000003
productive explanation

421.259 --> 428.759
but like it was not consciously meant to

425.34 --> 431.58
happen I definitely had not planned

428.759 --> 435.12
in that moment to like I was like oh

431.58 --> 437.58
yeah I was gonna go on the morgal no I

435.12 --> 440.6
did not plan that and it was like

437.58 --> 440.59999999999997
a screw up

440.94 --> 446.699
right and I shouldn't have called the

443.759 --> 449.40000000000003
morgow a junkie that was just super

446.699 --> 452.16
brutal brutally rude

449.4 --> 455.23999999999995
and yeah I I don't know about the

452.16 --> 455.24
situation exactly

455.819 --> 460.199
right

457.099 --> 463.08
according to what is on the streams and

460.199 --> 465.06
all that he had to stream even telling

463.08 --> 468.24
again about how it was the terrible

465.06 --> 469.62
financial situation yeah sure whatever I

468.24 --> 472.44
mean

469.62 --> 475.34000000000003
I mean I'm not gonna

472.44 --> 475.34
really

476.88 --> 481.44
like get drawn into that [ __ ] I got

479.22 --> 483.78000000000003
Financial issues of my own

481.44 --> 486.78
but

483.78 --> 489.31899999999996
so I'm not gonna like be guilt trip over

486.78 --> 489.31899999999996
what happened

490.02 --> 494.94
but I will definitely recognize that I

492.84 --> 498.599
made a mistake and that was just super

494.94 --> 501.84
rude and that yeah I can't forget about

498.599 --> 502.8
any contact with the morgal probably on

501.84 --> 504.78
my show

502.8 --> 507.199
if that was even gonna happen in the

504.78 --> 507.19899999999996
first place

509.4 --> 513.74
I don't I'm not too sure if it even was

513.839 --> 519.32
because

515.64 --> 519.3199999999999
well I think that

520.26 --> 526.14
I don't know exactly how that works but

523.62 --> 528.839
I'm just not really being I'm not being

526.14 --> 532.279
taken seriously by people out there

528.839 --> 532.2790000000001
really not really

538.68 --> 543.54
like people that have channels and that

541.5 --> 546.06
have more things like I don't know

543.54 --> 549.12
anybody out there that actually I guess

546.06 --> 551.399
really takes me serious

549.12 --> 554.3
and I mean

551.399 --> 554.3
Nathan

556.38 --> 560.88
I don't think he really takes me that

558.6 --> 563.1
serious either

560.88 --> 567.0
but he is

563.1 --> 570.48
he is like a friend to me

567.0 --> 572.16
it's an extremely forgiving and and all

570.48 --> 574.5
that so

572.16 --> 577.1999999999999
but uh

574.5 --> 580.08
or guys okay he's not a puppet or a

577.2 --> 582.4200000000001
Muppet this is I don't know skeptic

580.08 --> 585.0
hello by the way and hello will Brax

582.42 --> 587.88
first in chat

585.0 --> 590.18
I don't know what he is

587.88 --> 592.74
I don't know what's gonna happen there's

590.18 --> 593.88
not everything about it is something I

592.74 --> 596.16
like

593.88 --> 597.8389999999999
but that's yeah whatever man there's

596.16 --> 601.1
plenty about me that a lot of people

597.839 --> 601.1
don't like either and

601.2 --> 604.1600000000001
I don't know man

607.56 --> 613.3199999999999
I think I'm just not stable enough for

610.74 --> 615.3
vast majority of people to be taken

613.32 --> 618.3000000000001
seriously or something

615.3 --> 622.1999999999999
and then it just doesn't matter like

618.3 --> 625.88
whatever genius might come out if any I

622.2 --> 625.88
don't think it matters to people at all

626.519 --> 636.26
I think this world has become used to

629.66 --> 636.26
stable retards over unstable geniuses

637.08 --> 641.6600000000001
I think that's literally what it is and

653.279 --> 660.4399999999999
I'm gonna have to find some way to

656.64 --> 660.4399999999999
basically be more modest

662.42 --> 667.8199999999999
and just not have these expectations

674.1 --> 679.5790000000001
and somehow I have my ego be able to

676.8 --> 679.579
deal with that

685.56 --> 689.0999999999999
right anyway

693.18 --> 698.64
so there you go

695.7 --> 700.82
I'm sorry the morgow I was super rude to

698.64 --> 700.8199999999999
you

701.7 --> 706.1400000000001
didn't technically deserve that the

704.04 --> 708.0
whole situation was probably based on

706.14 --> 709.8
the misunderstanding

708.0 --> 712.92
and yeah

709.8 --> 715.26
and now let's move on

712.92 --> 716.88
right so yeah I had a title for today I

715.26 --> 718.4399999999999
had a really good talk with my healer

716.88 --> 721.8
and I asked him some questions about

718.44 --> 724.3800000000001
like Rudolph Steiner view on the

721.8 --> 726.06
on the realm especially the relation

724.38 --> 727.5
between the spirit realm and the

726.06 --> 730.26
material Realm

727.5 --> 732.3
he had a lot of things to say it was

730.26 --> 733.86
very inspiring also it made me think

732.3 --> 735.5999999999999
back to

733.86 --> 738.36
something that I talked about didn't

735.6 --> 741.4200000000001
bring it up to him at that point

738.36 --> 745.4590000000001
where remember the shows where hello Dr

741.42 --> 745.459
Utica by the way remember the shows

745.74 --> 751.0790000000001
where I talked

747.54 --> 753.779
about how the consciousness

751.079 --> 757.579
like in your dreams and envisions that

753.779 --> 760.88
everything that we construct is like

757.579 --> 760.88
based on

761.279 --> 767.0
on like reconstructions of experiences

767.66 --> 772.38
perception-based experiences in the

769.62 --> 774.0600000000001
material Realm and how that to the

772.38 --> 777.899
consciousness

774.06 --> 779.9399999999999
makes the spiritual realm like secondary

777.899 --> 783.86
but here's the weird thing

779.94 --> 783.86
that's for like the consciousness

784.019 --> 787.8
because

785.12 --> 789.18
technically according to Rudolph Steiner

787.8 --> 792.0
and I have to like really kind of give

789.18 --> 794.88
it to him like it does make sense he

792.0 --> 796.68
says and it even fits in my own like

794.88 --> 799.5
attempt at a

796.68 --> 801.66
super early the creation of reality

799.5 --> 804.18
right I had that story

801.66 --> 806.279
still have it around somewhere

804.18 --> 808.9799999999999
and in that too it's like the spirit

806.279 --> 811.88
realm exists first and then the material

808.98 --> 811.88
realm is like

813.3 --> 819.5999999999999
built beside it so it's like this

816.839 --> 823.3800000000001
parallel realities

819.6 --> 825.5400000000001
but everything that's material is like

823.38 --> 826.8
driven by a spirit and that's by the way

825.54 --> 830.06
also

826.8 --> 830.06
uh in her

831.32 --> 839.519
meticism says that to apparently or at

836.579 --> 842.2399999999999
least uh that video God damn I'm back

839.519 --> 842.24
with the names today

842.48 --> 848.519
original videos

845.959 --> 852.3599999999999
oh God yeah

848.519 --> 855.3
Hermes Tres Magistas like that vid that

852.36 --> 857.339
long video well very typically in that

855.3 --> 861.42
lore it is like everything has a spirit

857.339 --> 864.3000000000001
right rudel Steiner says that

861.42 --> 868.139
material things that basically don't

864.3 --> 870.899
have or have their Spirit withdrawn

868.139 --> 873.26
like they succumb to entropy very

870.899 --> 873.26
quickly

873.54 --> 878.6999999999999
something like that

875.639 --> 881.519
really fascinating so that in that sense

878.7 --> 884.1
the material realm is like directly

881.519 --> 887.399
dependent on the on the spiritual realm

884.1 --> 889.62
and in that sense like as a mechanical

887.399 --> 894.62
relationship

889.62 --> 894.62
energy interaction it's secondary

896.339 --> 902.8800000000001
which really does like

898.98 --> 906.48
well light a big fire Under The Cauldron

902.88 --> 911.579
of the simulation Theory

906.48 --> 913.6800000000001
which is like yeah it's like that's not

911.579 --> 916.3389999999999
how Rudolph Steiner thinks of it but

913.68 --> 916.3389999999999
it's definitely

917.04 --> 921.199
worth noting so yeah

922.199 --> 925.3389999999999
hello Richard G

926.639 --> 933.26
420 over there oh okay

929.579 --> 933.26
wow that's really early by the way

936.36 --> 938.899
huh

939.3 --> 944.899
right so yeah that's a very short piece

941.639 --> 949.32
I don't know if you guys are like ready

944.899 --> 951.6
to believe me ready to receive me

949.32 --> 955.5
but like this is a new mechanical

951.6 --> 957.48
Insight that's now going to be

955.5 --> 960.48
there

957.48 --> 962.94
and echoing if people are interested

960.48 --> 965.6990000000001
it's like I basically

962.94 --> 967.32
my inter-spiritual cosmology is now

965.699 --> 969.12
getting more

967.32 --> 972.36
structured

969.12 --> 974.82
with these insights that makes sense

972.36 --> 978.1990000000001
fascinating by the way like Hitler

974.82 --> 978.1990000000001
brought up a story that

979.38 --> 987.779
like before Earth there were like other

984.32 --> 988.8000000000001
planets yeah yeah it's the lingo is is

987.779 --> 991.079
tough

988.8 --> 994.38
but it's hilarious but it's all

991.079 --> 995.4799999999999
spiritual like it's non-material planets

994.38 --> 998.82
yeah

995.48 --> 1002.9590000000001
so before the Earth there were

998.82 --> 1004.94
what did he say the Sun the Moon

1002.959 --> 1009.8
and Saturn

1004.94 --> 1012.6800000000001
were like the previous like the the pre

1009.8 --> 1014.3
human incarnations

1012.68 --> 1017.66
like before

1014.3 --> 1020.079
eventually Earth and the Garden of Eden

1017.66 --> 1020.079
like

1020.36 --> 1024.079
so there were like

1022.04 --> 1026.24
you could say that those are like

1024.079 --> 1029.799
descriptions of the Garden of Eden State

1026.24 --> 1029.799
the pre-material state

1031.6 --> 1037.28
and Rudolph signer says that there were

1034.699 --> 1040.1000000000001
just like previous planetary spiritual

1037.28 --> 1044.36
incarnations where with like different

1040.1 --> 1048.3799999999999
basically different forms of creation

1044.36 --> 1050.0
like on the sun we were just pure light

1048.38 --> 1053.6000000000001
beings

1050.0 --> 1056.0
like literally light very weird it's

1053.6 --> 1057.74
that is kind of mystical

1056.0 --> 1061.039
and

1057.74 --> 1063.86
yeah other substances on the other

1061.039 --> 1067.22
incarnations it's fascinating

1063.86 --> 1068.4189999999999
like more Elementary more Elemental type

1067.22 --> 1071.98
spirits

1068.419 --> 1074.539
and that yeah well that then basically

1071.98 --> 1076.419
turned to Clay

1074.539 --> 1080.299
on Earth

1076.419 --> 1084.44
so it's like the Earth was like a

1080.299 --> 1087.98
an earth Elemental and from that

1084.44 --> 1090.44
was basically like yeah the the more

1087.98 --> 1095.02
human form that we're used to

1090.44 --> 1095.02
and then the whole thing basically got

1096.44 --> 1102.38
well as he describes it like spiritually

1099.08 --> 1105.32
down lettered into the material realm

1102.38 --> 1108.74
like the material became manifested out

1105.32 --> 1111.08
of the spirit realm because Lucifer

1108.74 --> 1113.559
started yeah that's it grafted into it

1111.08 --> 1113.559
definitely

1114.02 --> 1120.02
like Lucifer came down started like or

1117.26 --> 1121.7
yeah basically broke ranks you could say

1120.02 --> 1124.1
with the angels

1121.7 --> 1126.32
because it wasn't even physical yet

1124.1 --> 1129.62
right broke ranks with the angels

1126.32 --> 1132.34
started messing with the Earth Elemental

1129.62 --> 1132.34
state

1132.38 --> 1138.919
the Adam and Eve situation

1134.72 --> 1141.2
and that then created or caused as a

1138.919 --> 1144.14
secondary if it didn't create it Lucifer

1141.2 --> 1147.76
didn't create it but it caused

1144.14 --> 1149.66
the materialification

1147.76 --> 1152.0
of that

1149.66 --> 1154.3400000000001
of that situation and that's like what

1152.0 --> 1157.28
where we're at

1154.34 --> 1160.22
and the other part still exists like

1157.28 --> 1162.98
it's parallel now so it's like the

1160.22 --> 1164.78
spirit realm split up and now the

1162.98 --> 1166.34
material realm is there parallel and

1164.78 --> 1169.84
that's where where Consciousness is at

1166.34 --> 1169.84
but we're very interconnected

1170.66 --> 1174.8200000000002
really fascinating to me

1176.84 --> 1179.3799999999999
right

1181.58 --> 1185.36
I think I'm gonna like in this time

1183.32 --> 1187.82
period like dig a little bit more again

1185.36 --> 1189.74
into Rudolph Steiner because of the well

1187.82 --> 1191.6789999999999
the storms and the restlessness it's

1189.74 --> 1194.059
really helpful to focus on that because

1191.679 --> 1196.94
in this time period with all that

1194.059 --> 1200.6
restlessness in the autumn

1196.94 --> 1203.48
I can like very easily just get blown

1200.6 --> 1205.82
off my socks over nothing

1203.48 --> 1208.22
like lose myself because of a shock

1205.82 --> 1210.02
that's unexpected it's very [ __ ]

1208.22 --> 1212.2
annoying

1210.02 --> 1212.2
foreign

1215.5 --> 1221.0
ero is recommended to read Rudolph

1218.299 --> 1226.28
Steiner to stay in your body and well

1221.0 --> 1229.92
the empirical data from my analysis thus

1226.28 --> 1231.799
far proof that that is correct

1229.92 --> 1234.8600000000001
[Music]

1231.799 --> 1239.2
I mean when it works it works

1234.86 --> 1239.1999999999998
right hello Mojo good to see you

1240.94 --> 1244.049
[Music]

1244.52 --> 1247.58
by the way I really clean up my blocked

1246.799 --> 1249.02
list

1247.58 --> 1252.5
oh yeah

1249.02 --> 1255.08
my banned list a lot yesterday

1252.5 --> 1258.52
it's just weird [ __ ] go like there's a

1255.08 --> 1258.52
whole like what the hell is going on

1259.039 --> 1262.6
has anybody seen low fruit

1264.919 --> 1270.14
because somehow he's got a manager

1268.58 --> 1274.1789999999999
wrench

1270.14 --> 1274.179
and I don't know how that even happened

1274.36 --> 1280.76
and so did it Darth that's like what the

1277.88 --> 1284.6000000000001
[ __ ] is going on here

1280.76 --> 1284.6
foreign like

1288.5 --> 1292.6
like I didn't intend to have that

1294.81 --> 1298.02
[Music]

1301.1 --> 1305.12
oh by the way what the [ __ ] is going on

1303.08 --> 1309.1589999999999
with my subscribers

1305.12 --> 1309.1589999999999
seems like it's literally Frozen again

1311.0 --> 1315.2
like in that that's really unexpected by

1313.64 --> 1318.98
the way

1315.2 --> 1322.039
I haven't I have to take taken a look

1318.98 --> 1325.58
and yeah I what the [ __ ] like that's

1322.039 --> 1327.98
literally never happened before

1325.58 --> 1330.34
that's been happening for a while very

1327.98 --> 1330.34
odd

1338.12 --> 1341.08
uh

1342.38 --> 1346.179
but uh yeah it just

1347.539 --> 1354.679
right anyway if low fruit shows up I'll

1351.14 --> 1356.48
just give him a regular wrench again

1354.679 --> 1361.419
but uh

1356.48 --> 1361.419
that was so weird anyway I clean it up

1361.88 --> 1365.7800000000002
I gave him a wrench yeah I know doctor

1363.74 --> 1368.919
would go but I gave him a regular wrench

1365.78 --> 1373.6589999999999
as far as I know but maybe

1368.919 --> 1373.659
I did it's just weird

1374.78 --> 1380.96
he got a special wrench why not anymore

1378.2 --> 1383.059
I mean I never intended that so I

1380.96 --> 1385.4
removed those wrenches

1383.059 --> 1387.9189999999999
Darth has a regular wrench now I could

1385.4 --> 1390.919
actually just replace it but I couldn't

1387.919 --> 1393.14
get low fruit back in the

1390.919 --> 1393.919
by just typing the name he wouldn't show

1393.14 --> 1396.14
up

1393.919 --> 1400.0590000000002
so he has to actually show up in my chat

1396.14 --> 1400.0590000000002
again in order to get a wrench back

1405.93 --> 1413.559
[Music]

1408.62 --> 1413.559
I haven't seen him in a while but anyway

1418.46 --> 1425.559
so any feedback any ideas are you all

1422.059 --> 1425.559
just really tired or something

1425.72 --> 1429.44
foreign

1427.1 --> 1433.12
I forget sometimes it's really freaking

1429.44 --> 1433.1200000000001
early in the United States right now

1436.22 --> 1442.28
right well maybe his account is

1439.58 --> 1444.8799999999999
compromised

1442.28 --> 1444.8799999999999
could be

1448.22 --> 1452.3600000000001
because there were a whole bunch of

1449.659 --> 1454.22
people banned that I have absolutely no

1452.36 --> 1456.62
recollection of ever

1454.22 --> 1459.6200000000001
Banning

1456.62 --> 1464.059
really weird like people that are like

1459.62 --> 1466.1589999999999
pretty damn sure I unbanned Godzilla

1464.059 --> 1467.72
last time right and didn't get him

1466.159 --> 1470.0
banned again well he was in there again

1467.72 --> 1472.659
like what the [ __ ] is he doing here like

1470.0 --> 1472.659
what is that

1473.6 --> 1478.12
barely awake all right skeptic no

1475.94 --> 1478.1200000000001
problem

1483.559 --> 1488.8999999999999
right but anyway I'm gonna make much

1486.2 --> 1492.0800000000002
more effort I'm going to redouble my

1488.9 --> 1494.799
efforts because the emperor is coming

1492.08 --> 1498.1399999999999
of suppressing my anger

1494.799 --> 1501.58
or not well suppressing it

1498.14 --> 1501.5800000000002
making sure that

1506.98 --> 1512.539
like I said I find more constructive

1509.659 --> 1515.3600000000001
ways of dealing with it and not get into

1512.539 --> 1517.76
well rage seduction moments because

1515.36 --> 1521.36
that's what that was

1517.76 --> 1524.36
it's like a high tension and then

1521.36 --> 1526.6999999999998
whatever comes around is like bang and

1524.36 --> 1528.62
it just full aggression like the

1526.7 --> 1530.48
decision everything like the

1528.62 --> 1532.8799999999999
Consciousness gets Swept Away in a

1530.48 --> 1534.74
moment like that that's really how it

1532.88 --> 1538.64
happened yesterday

1534.74 --> 1540.74
right and it was also in a ways

1538.64 --> 1542.72
projection based it was in security

1540.74 --> 1545.44
projection based

1542.72 --> 1545.44
definitely

1547.1 --> 1551.6589999999999
right I can tell you that like calling

1549.919 --> 1554.419
him a junkie yeah that's freaking

1551.659 --> 1557.0590000000002
projection fear

1554.419 --> 1559.279
I I think of myself like that sometimes

1557.059 --> 1562.1589999999999
even though yeah I smoke cannabis that's

1559.279 --> 1565.22
it but I mean yeah I don't have really a

1562.159 --> 1567.5
working life so officially people out

1565.22 --> 1569.1200000000001
there are going to classify me as a

1567.5 --> 1572.0
junkie

1569.12 --> 1574.3999999999999
and it really [ __ ] sucks and my ego

1572.0 --> 1577.039
really doesn't like it but at the same

1574.4 --> 1579.5590000000002
time like

1577.039 --> 1583.58
go [ __ ] themselves

1579.559 --> 1587.0
that's also the response because even if

1583.58 --> 1590.1789999999999
I didn't if I was productive and I

1587.0 --> 1591.38
didn't smoke and and they they'd still

1590.179 --> 1593.72
hate me

1591.38 --> 1596.74
because a lot of people they just like

1593.72 --> 1596.74
to be judgmental

1598.4 --> 1603.0800000000002
they don't really care they don't judge

1601.039 --> 1605.779
people because they are trying to push

1603.08 --> 1607.58
them to be better yeah a lot of people

1605.779 --> 1609.44
just judge you because they want to be

1607.58 --> 1611.299
judgmental [ __ ] and feel like

1609.44 --> 1613.76
they're better than you

1611.299 --> 1615.679
and so if I change all that they

1613.76 --> 1617.96
couldn't do that anymore they'd find

1615.679 --> 1620.1200000000001
something else they'd still say I'd be

1617.96 --> 1622.72
unaccomplied it's like so it doesn't

1620.12 --> 1622.7199999999998
really matter

1625.1 --> 1631.82
like if I quit and all that

1629.299 --> 1635.3799999999999
just because of what people say then

1631.82 --> 1635.3799999999999
those people would then rule me

1635.779 --> 1641.72
so but it was technically in the moment

1639.08 --> 1644.539
projection right I got snatched up with

1641.72 --> 1646.58
my Consciousness went full in at the

1644.539 --> 1648.52
worst moment it was totally out of

1646.58 --> 1651.74
nothing

1648.52 --> 1654.1399999999999
and everything gets drawn in all my

1651.74 --> 1657.5
insecurities all

1654.14 --> 1660.38
right although yeah the thing that I

1657.5 --> 1662.72
consciously bit down on like

1660.38 --> 1665.96
leaving somebody to wait

1662.72 --> 1668.779
that is something that I don't do

1665.96 --> 1671.24
me personally yeah

1668.779 --> 1674.299
I mean I might be like late

1671.24 --> 1676.88
10 minutes half an hour something right

1674.299 --> 1679.9
on my show sometimes

1676.88 --> 1679.9
or like

1680.299 --> 1686.0
yeah at an appointment

1682.46 --> 1689.0
maybe I'd be a little late

1686.0 --> 1690.919
but I would never just not show up and

1689.0 --> 1696.14
not say anything and and then make

1690.919 --> 1699.679
excuses or that I I never do that ever I

1696.14 --> 1701.48
like despise people that do that

1699.679 --> 1704.919
like I can never be friends with people

1701.48 --> 1704.919
that that do that ever

1705.08 --> 1709.539
I I sit like really this why is that

1710.02 --> 1717.7
so that part was not projection

1713.72 --> 1717.7
but a lot of the other things were

1720.32 --> 1727.279
like potentially even

1723.62 --> 1728.8999999999999
me say I'm not sure like saying to him

1727.279 --> 1730.88
like what you think you're better than

1728.9 --> 1733.159
me and all that

1730.88 --> 1735.98
I don't know

1733.159 --> 1738.3200000000002
if the morgow is like that at all

1735.98 --> 1740.9
he might have been in the past I don't

1738.32 --> 1743.12
know if he's like that anymore

1740.9 --> 1745.88
I mean with their contact on Skype I

1743.12 --> 1748.4599999999998
didn't get that feeling so that also

1745.88 --> 1752.5590000000002
might have been projection

1748.46 --> 1756.02
right so there there you go full on

1752.559 --> 1758.26
confessional analysis of what I did

1756.02 --> 1758.26
yesterday

1760.22 --> 1764.779
because yeah that sort of thing does

1762.679 --> 1766.76
happen and it is problematic and I'm

1764.779 --> 1769.58
pretty sure I'm not the only one that

1766.76 --> 1772.76
sort of thing happens to

1769.58 --> 1775.52
and you really do have to analyze it

1772.76 --> 1779.84
because if you try to deny it or cover

1775.52 --> 1783.799
it up you'll be like chasing denial like

1779.84 --> 1788.1999999999998
for a while makes you look much worse

1783.799 --> 1791.96
better to just immediately spot it

1788.2 --> 1794.059
calm down get like the nervous route

1791.96 --> 1796.64
that's doing that out of there if you

1794.059 --> 1800.48
can I called my healer he helped me it

1796.64 --> 1802.64
that really works yeah I because

1800.48 --> 1804.74
once you get knocked out of your body

1802.64 --> 1806.72
like that to a hundred when you lose a

1804.74 --> 1808.7
hundred percent of your spirit and that

1806.72 --> 1811.159
can happen doesn't mean you die it's not

1808.7 --> 1813.799
like that but it's like you lose control

1811.159 --> 1817.159
in a way and that can happen to some

1813.799 --> 1819.74
people I am somehow more prone to it

1817.159 --> 1821.6000000000001
especially in like weather situations

1819.74 --> 1824.179
like this

1821.6 --> 1827.36
and then you can't put it back yourself

1824.179 --> 1828.74
like my technique doesn't work then when

1827.36 --> 1831.1399999999999
I do it

1828.74 --> 1833.179
you have to be have a certain percentage

1831.14 --> 1835.039
to be able to restore yourself to 100

1833.179 --> 1836.0
and that's why I needed to call my

1835.039 --> 1838.52
healer

1836.0 --> 1841.039
I and I and I didn't wait either I mean

1838.52 --> 1844.22
I recognized that even yesterday night

1841.039 --> 1846.679
like oh this is not good I've got to

1844.22 --> 1849.7
call my healer and I did and and I

1846.679 --> 1849.7
really feel better now

1849.86 --> 1855.08
but apparently you need external

1852.32 --> 1856.8799999999999
restoration when you lose it all when

1855.08 --> 1860.08
you lose all your spirit

1856.88 --> 1860.0800000000002
when you get knocked out

1860.419 --> 1864.279
you need external restoration

1864.799 --> 1871.34
I or I need that

1868.46 --> 1873.919
or it could just dwell on and pretend

1871.34 --> 1876.62
like oh no I could I could take care of

1873.919 --> 1878.72
it and then just stumble around like a

1876.62 --> 1881.2399999999998
lot of people do well no I'd like to

1878.72 --> 1886.1000000000001
just [ __ ] fix it

1881.24 --> 1888.58
quick because I know how this works now

1886.1 --> 1888.58
anyway

1893.299 --> 1899.1399999999999
I also proof prone to that you just

1896.059 --> 1899.1399999999999
don't know how to fix it

1899.96 --> 1902.08
um

1904.279 --> 1909.32
well you can't like permanently fix it

1906.86 --> 1911.6
but you can basically like clean

1909.32 --> 1915.26
yourself out

1911.6 --> 1917.9599999999998
yeah I mean I'd say like contact my

1915.26 --> 1921.08
healer or some like somebody that's

1917.96 --> 1922.88
really into like Rudolph Steiner Spirit

1921.08 --> 1927.46
healing

1922.88 --> 1927.46
because it's bound to be similar

1932.0 --> 1935.44
maybe I could do it

1937.82 --> 1940.6589999999999
I don't know

1943.039 --> 1948.26
I mean I I'd love to bring in contact

1945.5 --> 1951.32
with him but I mean it is

1948.26 --> 1953.0
yeah he's Dutch he's not super good at

1951.32 --> 1956.48
English I mean he could probably still

1953.0 --> 1960.039
maybe yeah maybe I can ask him

1956.48 --> 1960.039
next time I call him

1960.32 --> 1963.46
maybe you do it

1967.279 --> 1971.84
sometimes it takes days to feel kind of

1969.679 --> 1972.98
backed on yes that's what normally

1971.84 --> 1977.1789999999999
happens

1972.98 --> 1980.779
well with my healer he he did really

1977.179 --> 1985.0590000000002
well haste in that process a lot

1980.779 --> 1985.059
to just basically get there immediately

1989.6 --> 1995.26
I wish I could do it just like that on

1993.019 --> 1995.26
you

2007.36 --> 2011.399
will you meet him private no on the

2009.22 --> 2011.3990000000001
phone

2012.82 --> 2018.8799999999999
no he doesn't do internet

2016.24 --> 2022.44
or barely

2018.88 --> 2022.44
he's had so much trouble

2022.779 --> 2027.94
with internet because stalkers and [ __ ]

2025.779 --> 2029.559
like people that are after him because

2027.94 --> 2032.3400000000001
he's like challenged the medical

2029.559 --> 2032.34
establishment

2032.44 --> 2036.5800000000002
foreign

2034.419 --> 2039.1000000000001
like he used to be a practicing doctor

2036.58 --> 2041.5
and then went alternative and like he's

2039.1 --> 2044.34
like off the internet now

2041.5 --> 2044.34
because of that

2046.559 --> 2051.399
are we still a doctor I think

2049.54 --> 2054.159
but anyway

2051.399 --> 2058.02
how did I find him through my dad

2054.159 --> 2058.02
he's like a colleague of my dad

2061.72 --> 2064.56
hello Sam

2067.839 --> 2072.639
so my dad recommended him then I went to

2070.78 --> 2075.0400000000004
visit him and

2072.639 --> 2077.379
and that wasn't a time when I was like

2075.04 --> 2079.599
really doing bad when I was like

2077.379 --> 2080.6189999999997
savagely getting haunted by my visions

2079.599 --> 2082.2400000000002
and

2080.619 --> 2085.56
and went ahead

2082.24 --> 2085.56
basically just

2094.54 --> 2098.379
it's like in 2015.

2106.54 --> 2110.02
I'm still looking back at that time and

2108.88 --> 2112.119
just like

2110.02 --> 2114.22
I mean because I wasn't just like oh

2112.119 --> 2116.44
lose weight Journal of like these

2114.22 --> 2118.5989999999997
nightmares and [ __ ] because I was just

2116.44 --> 2121.839
still so freaking nervous and scared and

2118.599 --> 2125.2000000000003
[ __ ] but man like there was so much

2121.839 --> 2127.48
crazy [ __ ] going on in my head back then

2125.2 --> 2130.9199999999996
like all these fission [ __ ] just getting

2127.48 --> 2130.92
piled on me suddenly

2132.04 --> 2139.119
and like like uh like it it's like not

2136.96 --> 2140.7400000000002
just remembering the Visions but also

2139.119 --> 2143.56
like almost like interactive

2140.74 --> 2146.3799999999997
hallucinations that would come with

2143.56 --> 2148.42
remembering it it's like I remember it

2146.38 --> 2150.52
happened and then certainly like things

2148.42 --> 2153.16
start moving and [ __ ]

2150.52 --> 2156.16
like ah

2153.16 --> 2156.16
terrifying

2170.26 --> 2175.9
all based on this this bizarre thing

2173.32 --> 2179.6800000000003
that happened to me like in there

2175.9 --> 2182.32
like a spell that happened on me like in

2179.68 --> 2184.0899999999997
the Dark World

2182.32 --> 2187.199
there were certain things that

2184.09 --> 2187.199
[Music]

2187.3 --> 2192.76
I tricked myself into believing I did in

2190.54 --> 2194.44
reality

2192.76 --> 2197.0200000000004
and apparently

2194.44 --> 2200.2000000000003
like in the dark world I consciously did

2197.02 --> 2202.66
that which is like

2200.2 --> 2206.2
just crazy

2202.66 --> 2209.2
just crazy but the thing is is that the

2206.2 --> 2212.859
way it's placed in my memory I can't

2209.2 --> 2215.2
convince myself it's not real

2212.859 --> 2218.56
and I have to just be really strong and

2215.2 --> 2221.2
100 in my body to be able to recognize

2218.56 --> 2224.0789999999997
that it is actually an illusion because

2221.2 --> 2226.66
as soon as I get less

2224.079 --> 2229.42
and think back about I just can't think

2226.66 --> 2231.64
of it as being fake like it's literally

2229.42 --> 2233.619
impossible to me it's like a a

2231.64 --> 2234.8199999999997
delusional nightmare of something

2233.619 --> 2238.44
horrific

2234.82 --> 2238.44
that I haven't actually done

2239.38 --> 2244.06
and it's so tough

2241.119 --> 2246.52
to deal with it sometimes and it and I'm

2244.06 --> 2249.22
just like why the [ __ ]

2246.52 --> 2252.839
like what the hell did I think I was

2249.22 --> 2252.839
gonna accomplish doing that

2254.2 --> 2261.0989999999997
when did I ever sit like how did that

2258.28 --> 2264.2400000000002
make sense to me

2261.099 --> 2264.2400000000002
I don't get it

2264.52 --> 2269.56
but maybe I was literally out running

2266.56 --> 2274.0
the fair anyways because that was in

2269.56 --> 2276.64
well it probably yeah I mean guys I

2274.0 --> 2277.98
could very mechanically argue that the

2276.64 --> 2281.68
devil did it

2277.98 --> 2286.079
in because he visited me and [ __ ] right

2281.68 --> 2286.0789999999997
when that happened 2017 and

2287.02 --> 2293.7
and that for some reason like

2291.099 --> 2293.7000000000003
oh my God

2295.42 --> 2301.5
I think I I know how it just it's too

2298.9 --> 2301.5
embarrassing

2306.22 --> 2309.8999999999996
I thought I had to prove something

2311.44 --> 2317.4
but that turned out to be kind of

2314.74 --> 2317.3999999999996
delusional

2319.24 --> 2327.4199999999996
and now that delusional thing I thought

2322.359 --> 2327.42
I'd would have to do like be a man

2328.24 --> 2335.0789999999997
was uh yeah now imprinted on me as a as

2332.32 --> 2337.599
an illusion that I think is real

2335.079 --> 2341.2200000000003
even though there's absolutely no leads

2337.599 --> 2341.2200000000003
that it is actually real

2347.52 --> 2353.64
hey doctor groceries

2351.099 --> 2353.6400000000003
all right

2356.44 --> 2361.96
hello Lenox by the way good to see you

has anyone bothered to gerunds wow

2381.46 --> 2387.28
no land Lennox had no idea but I mean

2385.0 --> 2391.96
really it's like oh have you seen

2387.28 --> 2393.96
Randy's latest stream yeah no

2391.96 --> 2393.96
no

2394.06 --> 2399.099
I mean if he's going with like Brenda

2396.76 --> 2403.3
now that's like well then he's went for

2399.099 --> 2406.32
ranty I mean it is like it is that

2403.3 --> 2406.32
is it not

2423.099 --> 2429.839
it's like the fire it's like the bottom

2425.56 --> 2429.839
layer and after that you just stop

2443.2 --> 2450.24
okay but you say Brenda has claimed the

2446.68 --> 2450.24
blacks like what does that mean

2450.7 --> 2456.359
what do you mean she claimed that

2453.82 --> 2456.3590000000004
when

2459.51 --> 2462.6090000000004
[Music]

2473.859 --> 2476.04

2486.359 --> 2492.46

2489.94 --> 2495.46
tell me so that I don't have to hear

2492.46 --> 2495.46
that

2498.4 --> 2504.119
you suffered through it so we don't have

2500.619 --> 2504.119
to now tell us what she said

2508.48 --> 2513.64
try to summarize it or was it just so

2511.3 --> 2517.8
convoluted that you you can't even put

2513.64 --> 2517.7999999999997
it together was it so incoherent

2517.96 --> 2522.06
she claimed the Black Swan about what

2522.46 --> 2526.32
not the Horizon I take it

2526.56 --> 2533.38
or did she like try to reverse

2530.079 --> 2536.7400000000002
like oh no if you if the Horizon looks

2533.38 --> 2539.38
like a globe one time well that's a

2536.74 --> 2541.24
Black Swan for a flat earth like did she

2539.38 --> 2544.2400000000002
do something like that I could imagine

2541.24 --> 2546.3999999999996
that she'd do something like that

2544.24 --> 2548.4599999999996
that that would be a brand new thing to

2546.4 --> 2548.46
do

2561.24 --> 2568.56
yeah yeah skeptic

2564.88 --> 2568.56

2994.18 --> 2998.16

3005.88 --> 3009.079
and 25 seconds

3012.92 --> 3019.76
at least YouTube doesn't seem to be

3015.24 --> 3019.7599999999998
freezing by the way that is that is nice

3019.859 --> 3024.839
seems to stupid maybe I just had to go

3022.319 --> 3026.7599999999998
off uh and be irrationally angry for

3024.839 --> 3028.94
YouTube to stop [ __ ] around or

3026.76 --> 3028.94
something

3029.46 --> 3034.76
had to slap the Gremlins with the

3031.68 --> 3034.7599999999998
psionic Lash

3042.0 --> 3046.26
hey lumpy guys in fact dude somebody had

3044.76 --> 3048.3

3048.3 --> 3053.3590000000004
or did I do it God I don't know

3053.4 --> 3058.44
I mean I do get agitated sometimes but I

3056.16 --> 3061.3799999999997
don't just like ban you guys like that

3058.44 --> 3063.059
right I mean not without you actually

3061.38 --> 3064.6400000000003
making a scene

3063.059 --> 3067.02
or like

3064.64 --> 3069.98
protesting declaring you're gay or

3067.02 --> 3069.98
something right

3074.52 --> 3078.72
and then I I didn't know you were that

3077.46 --> 3082.559
ugly

3078.72 --> 3082.5589999999997
lumpy gas what

3083.339 --> 3088.38
yeah welcome back anyway

3085.559 --> 3091.079
so no wonder people haven't been showing

3088.38 --> 3093.78
up what the [ __ ]

3091.079 --> 3095.04
everybody just got banned somehow who

3093.78 --> 3098.8390000000004
the hell did that

3095.04 --> 3098.839
and how the hell did that happen

3103.98 --> 3106.7
oh

3107.4 --> 3112.38
still showing two hours

3109.68 --> 3116.7599999999998
Now 51 oh okay

3112.38 --> 3116.76
you don't get notifications weird

3131.64 --> 3140.1189999999997
you had a management you did notice

3134.7 --> 3140.1189999999997
but did I give you one the first go

3143.52 --> 3148.02
did did you notice that right away or

3146.099 --> 3151.319
you figured it out later whatever it's

3148.02 --> 3154.74
not I'm not suspecting you

3151.319 --> 3157.02
so not me Mania no no I'm not suspecting

3154.74 --> 3159.7999999999997
you of that

3157.02 --> 3159.8
directly

3162.24 --> 3166.5589999999997
I mean there's like nothing about how

3164.76 --> 3168.78
you're talking or anything that gives me

3166.559 --> 3172.94
any spiritual metadata that makes me

3168.78 --> 3172.94
suspect you so don't worry about it

3174.66 --> 3178.3999999999996
oh you just noticed it right

3187.68 --> 3192.18
or I had already taken it away by the

3189.9 --> 3194.64
way I took it away yesterday

3192.18 --> 3195.839
but anyway things are sort of back to

3194.64 --> 3197.819
normal

3195.839 --> 3199.859
YouTube's not an honestly yeah well

3197.819 --> 3201.9
maybe well maybe somebody is just

3199.859 --> 3204.2999999999997
literally [ __ ] around with my channel

3201.9 --> 3205.619
somehow

3204.3 --> 3209.099
and like

3205.619 --> 3211.2000000000003
being sneaky about it

3209.099 --> 3213.8590000000004
I'm certainly not getting any weird

3211.2 --> 3213.859
notifications

3214.02 --> 3220.68
like because if it's like from another

3217.619 --> 3223.339
IEP address you know

3220.68 --> 3223.339
like

3223.74 --> 3228.5989999999997
it does take note of that and that's not

3226.02 --> 3231.3
happening so

3228.599 --> 3234.26
that's just something weird going on

3231.3 --> 3234.26
I don't like it

3241.74 --> 3247.5589999999997
but yeah I just gonna have to keep

3243.96 --> 3249.66
maintaining it manually and keep looking

3247.559 --> 3251.94
through my band list

3249.66 --> 3254.52
to see if there's not anybody in there

3251.94 --> 3256.44
that shouldn't be in there because if I

3254.52 --> 3260.64
wish I could like make a band filters

3256.44 --> 3264.2000000000003
like these people cannot be banned

3260.64 --> 3264.2
but then not tell you

3266.819 --> 3270.48
but yeah that's kind of what the

3268.2 --> 3272.5789999999997
wrenches were for

3270.48 --> 3275.16
because the funny thing is if you have a

3272.579 --> 3277.5
wrench you can't be Ben

3275.16 --> 3279.18
can only be banned if the wrench is then

3277.5 --> 3283.7
revoked

3279.18 --> 3283.7
but only managing moderators can do that

3295.64 --> 3302.359
software can have bugs and yeah no [ __ ]

3298.44 --> 3302.359
you two have bucks lots of them

3302.69 --> 3305.789
[Music]

3305.94 --> 3309.559
and I keep reoccurring

3311.579 --> 3317.6400000000003
what's the talk

3313.319 --> 3320.359
uh well I had a bit a bit of spirit talk

3317.64 --> 3320.359
earlier

3320.7 --> 3327.5
certain spiritual mechanic insights

3324.48 --> 3327.5
and yeah

3329.7 --> 3334.9399999999996
somebody Len Lennox shared

3335.04 --> 3338.66
that jiren had

3340.04 --> 3346.079
a debateism with Brenda

3343.859 --> 3348.0589999999997
so

3346.079 --> 3351.119
that's just funny

3348.059 --> 3352.8190000000004
I mean that's just funny to me like I

3351.119 --> 3356.2200000000003
don't really want to watch it to be fair

3352.819 --> 3359.339
like I mean maybe Nathan more I bet

3356.22 --> 3363.359
Nathan will not review it because I mean

3359.339 --> 3366.5
Brenda is like very unpleasant

3363.359 --> 3366.5
to listen to

3368.35 --> 3372.72
[Music]

3370.02 --> 3374.339
is Jaron full Globe now too I don't know

3372.72 --> 3376.0789999999997
what the hell he's doing man I don't

3374.339 --> 3378.48
know if he even knows what he's doing

3376.079 --> 3381.3590000000004
but it just feels like he's following

3378.48 --> 3386.42
like in Randy's footsteps he's he's like

3381.359 --> 3386.42
going for ranty never go for renty

3398.119 --> 3403.859
apparently sure he loves you and uh

3401.76 --> 3407.46
thanks for that gorgeous for thanks for

3403.859 --> 3407.46
that image Godzilla

3417.21 --> 3420.32
[Music]

3421.5 --> 3426.359
looks like a man of woman's wig yes just

3424.619 --> 3429.359
looks like a not

3426.359 --> 3431.5789999999997
two great looking

3429.359 --> 3435.0789999999997
middle-aged older woman

3431.579 --> 3435.079
now but to be fair yet

3435.3 --> 3438.619
it's not looking great

3448.38 --> 3454.7400000000002
well I had a previous picture in which

3451.74 --> 3456.839
he did kind of look like a not very

3454.74 --> 3460.4399999999996
attractive older woman

3456.839 --> 3463.68
but yeah then this I know what you mean

3460.44 --> 3466.46
it does really kind of look more like a

3463.68 --> 3466.46
middle-aged man

3466.68 --> 3470.0589999999997
this is kind of tragic

3470.64 --> 3473.24
whatever

3474.54 --> 3481.88
to suck don't do that

3477.54 --> 3481.88
don't don't do that skeptic

3485.579 --> 3489.119
technically you shouldn't joke about

3487.319 --> 3491.42
that sort of thing I mean it's not that

3489.119 --> 3491.42
bad

3499.14 --> 3505.74
I mean you you could also

3503.64 --> 3508.0789999999997
like do what happens here in the

3505.74 --> 3511.9199999999996
Netherlands

3508.079 --> 3516.059
there's this party member here

3511.92 --> 3518.7000000000003
who literally came on Prince day

3516.059 --> 3521.1600000000003
in a pink dress and that's a guy with a

3518.7 --> 3522.1189999999997
mustache

3521.16 --> 3525.0589999999997
yeah

3522.119 --> 3526.92
who's like in the parliament

3525.059 --> 3529.799
so

3526.92 --> 3531.96
I mean we should be glad with people

3529.799 --> 3534.359
like Brenda because at least they really

3531.96 --> 3538.68
try to look like a woman

3534.359 --> 3538.68
because that is anyway

3544.81 --> 3547.909
[Music]

3549.54 --> 3556.099
yeah you're not welcome here bro this is

3553.5 --> 3556.099
not uh

3556.92 --> 3560.9
you're in the wrong Saloon buddy

3566.04 --> 3575.04
maybe stand focus on the derp

3570.18 --> 3578.3999999999996
yeah but it's more tiresome lumpy gas

3575.04 --> 3581.88
I mean I'd gladly just make fun of

3578.4 --> 3585.6600000000003
appearances just so I don't have to like

3581.88 --> 3587.7000000000003
strain my mind with the idiocy that

3585.66 --> 3589.6189999999997
comes out of these people and I'm

3587.7 --> 3591.839
talking about both examples that

3589.619 --> 3595.079
includes the political idiot

3591.839 --> 3597.72
of the dying party that's like super pro

3595.079 --> 3601.6800000000003
w e f [ __ ]

3597.72 --> 3606.1189999999997
climate change Nut Cases all that crap

3601.68 --> 3609.299
or a Brenda that literally is Infamous

3606.119 --> 3612.54
for saying phenomenon in a scientific

3609.299 --> 3613.92
experiment is shoe right I mean what the

3612.54 --> 3616.68
[ __ ]

3613.92 --> 3620.48
I don't really want to go through what

3616.68 --> 3620.48
they talk about if you know what I mean

3621.0 --> 3626.4
like even in this thing

3623.46 --> 3629.52
in the video I like I wouldn't actually

3626.4 --> 3631.98
listen to what Brenda says I wouldn't I

3629.52 --> 3634.579
would only listen to what Jaron says in

3631.98 --> 3634.579
response

3634.74 --> 3639.839
because

3636.319 --> 3642.18
Jaren didn't used to be a completely

3639.839 --> 3644.88
deranged idiot

3642.18 --> 3647.7599999999998
so that's kind of new if he'd actually

3644.88 --> 3649.559
stooped this low like he did with mctoon

3647.76 --> 3651.42
and yeah so if this is his new thing

3649.559 --> 3655.1400000000003
then I'd be willing to sort of listen

3651.42 --> 3657.42
like how bad it's gotten with jiren but

3655.14 --> 3661.02
I'm not even like I don't care what

3657.42 --> 3662.4
Brenda says she always talks complete

3661.02 --> 3666.18
horse [ __ ]

3662.4 --> 3667.7400000000002
like I don't listen to her ever like

3666.18 --> 3672.14
never again

3667.74 --> 3672.14
like always crap always

3672.48 --> 3678.359
like when it comes to like Flat Earth or

3675.54 --> 3681.0589999999997
globe or anything

3678.359 --> 3682.5589999999997
most things that come out of her are

3681.059 --> 3687.1400000000003
crap

3682.559 --> 3687.1400000000003
I'm sorry Miranda it's just what it is

3692.339 --> 3697.38
no

3694.94 --> 3700.859
Brenda thinks

3697.38 --> 3702.299
she owns kiwis modus tolan's argument

3700.859 --> 3704.0989999999997
reflex

3702.299 --> 3706.2599999999998
she owns it

3704.099 --> 3708.839
okay

3706.26 --> 3711.6600000000003
but how is how is she supposedly

3708.839 --> 3713.46
applying it

3711.66 --> 3715.319
to what

3713.46 --> 3717.54
I mean it's cool that she gets the

3715.319 --> 3721.2799999999997
modestoles argument and all but how is

3717.54 --> 3721.2799999999997
she applying the Black Swan exactly

3724.5 --> 3728.0
hey slo-mo moon buggy

3730.74 --> 3734.72
good premise was false

3737.64 --> 3742.74
no

3739.74 --> 3742.74
uh

3743.52 --> 3748.559
thanks for

3745.5 --> 3750.72
sharing that singing star water that's

3748.559 --> 3753.96
and that's why I don't listen to Brenda

3750.72 --> 3756.72
it's so tiresome

3753.96 --> 3759.299
so tedious

3756.72 --> 3763.22
but thank you for reminding me exactly

3759.299 --> 3763.22
why I don't listen to Brenda

3771.42 --> 3777.559
exhausting ADC yep

3774.359 --> 3777.5589999999997
yep that's a good summary

3784.619 --> 3787.52
foreign

3795.0 --> 3798.079
[Music]

3814.04 --> 3820.319
so it therefore it's false

3818.7 --> 3823.3999999999996
further than

3820.319 --> 3826.2599999999998
yeah so complete malarkey

3823.4 --> 3829.5
Godzilla complete Malarkey nonsense as

3826.26 --> 3831.48
usual I mean it's just it's really like

3829.5 --> 3834.54
Petty

3831.48 --> 3837.9
Petty word magician trick it's so

3834.54 --> 3841.319
pathetic she's like a really she's doing

3837.9 --> 3843.26
it like a super super cheap psychologist

3841.319 --> 3845.52
just

3843.26 --> 3848.78
claying it around and just everything

3845.52 --> 3848.78
becomes nonsense

3851.52 --> 3856.14
I'm sorry to insult the psychology of

3854.28 --> 3859.2000000000003
professions I'm sure none of you would

3856.14 --> 3861.3799999999997
ever associate with her or him or

3859.2 --> 3861.3799999999997
whatever

3861.5 --> 3868.14
I'm just but she is always like trying

3865.079 --> 3869.6400000000003
to manipulate people like and manipulate

3868.14 --> 3871.74
thoughts

3869.64 --> 3874.2
she's like one of those people that just

3871.74 --> 3876.299
wants everything to be possible like she

3874.2 --> 3878.3999999999996
wants

3876.299 --> 3880.44
complete mental Freedom so that

3878.4 --> 3883.619
literally

3880.44 --> 3886.579
contradictions are okay kind of thing

3883.619 --> 3889.1400000000003
until it's politically like

3886.579 --> 3891.48
inconvenient or like not aligned with

3889.14 --> 3893.94
what she wants and then she'll like like

3891.48 --> 3897.14
the the police the politic [ __ ] right

3893.94 --> 3897.14
because that's a system

3897.42 --> 3901.7400000000002
it's the overthrow of all rationality

3899.52 --> 3903.839
it's just everything is only political

3901.74 --> 3905.819
like nothing everything can when

3903.839 --> 3908.52
everything can be true

3905.819 --> 3912.359
then only

3908.52 --> 3914.099
being part of the party thinking is what

3912.359 --> 3915.9
matters that like

3914.099 --> 3918.0
whether something is aligned to the

3915.9 --> 3921.0
party thinking will determine whether

3918.0 --> 3925.859
something is wrong or right that's how

3921.0 --> 3927.9
she thinks it is like a full-on 1984.

3925.859 --> 3931.98
mental state

3927.9 --> 3934.799
she really is like that

3931.98 --> 3936.599
and like has been since like the first

3934.799 --> 3938.78
time I met her she's always been like

3936.599 --> 3938.78
that

3940.89 --> 3944.0099999999998
[Music]

3952.52 --> 3960.44
tries to set up gotchas yeah oh well of

3956.16 --> 3960.44
course the whole troll book works

3961.38 --> 3968.28
she is like a professional manipulator

3963.72 --> 3971.2799999999997
very fanatical but not very good though

3968.28 --> 3973.7400000000002
not sophisticated

3971.28 --> 3977.88
cheap tricks

3973.74 --> 3981.299
like very dependent on the weaker of

3977.88 --> 3984.92
mind to be able to be taken serious at

3981.299 --> 3984.92
all that's what she is

3985.38 --> 3989.359
a manipulator low class

3990.299 --> 3993.14
compulsive

4006.559 --> 4013.299
yeah number third yes

4009.5 --> 4013.299
always it's like that always

4024.02 --> 4027.2889999999998
[Music]

4041.9 --> 4047.599
yes there they all do because if you

4045.079 --> 4050.6600000000003
want to hold on to your ball belief

4047.599 --> 4052.579
you'll have to throw all rationality and

4050.66 --> 4056.48
logic overboard

4052.579 --> 4058.6400000000003
and become adrift in the

4056.48 --> 4062.44
a rational

4058.64 --> 4062.44
political way of thinking

4062.539 --> 4065.9
yeah

4063.68 --> 4067.52
either you're with

4065.9 --> 4070.46
the book

4067.52 --> 4073.4
of that tells you how things are

4070.46 --> 4075.2200000000003
supposed to be or you're against it

4073.4 --> 4079.78
foreign

4075.22 --> 4079.7799999999997
any arguments can be used

4080.78 --> 4087.38
or cracked down and broken apart

4083.96 --> 4090.859
depending on whether you are aligned

4087.38 --> 4093.38
or not aligned with the party thinking

4090.859 --> 4096.14
that's how it works it's how the entire

4093.38 --> 4097.9400000000005
like guys I've been saying for a while

4096.14 --> 4101.62
yeah

4097.94 --> 4101.62
the globe is part

4102.679 --> 4106.759
it's like part of the same train right

4104.66 --> 4109.88
first you get

4106.759 --> 4111.859
the replacement of Christ with a false

4109.88 --> 4114.14
idol type thing

4111.859 --> 4116.779
with the wisdom of Christ still

4114.14 --> 4119.660000000001
Underneath It All But like it is like a

4116.779 --> 4122.14
fake illusion about what what's

4119.66 --> 4122.139999999999
happening

4122.66 --> 4128.9
making the [ __ ] Christians

4125.48 --> 4130.879999999999
that keep dilapidating keep watching now

4128.9 --> 4133.699
right

4130.88 --> 4136.219
the original Christians were like really

4133.699 --> 4140.3589999999995
strong much more like like classic

4136.219 --> 4143.08
Muslims right Muslims came yeah around

4140.359 --> 4143.08
the same time

4143.719 --> 4147.859
so that started first it's like first

4146.06 --> 4150.38
the overthrow of Christ the replacement

4147.859 --> 4152.120000000001
of Christ with the Antichrist through

4150.38 --> 4155.06
the Catholic church because they are at

4152.12 --> 4158.12
the part of it then comes the globe

4155.06 --> 4161.779
and then comes communism

4158.12 --> 4164.12
because they're one

4161.779 --> 4165.799000000001
one thing

4164.12 --> 4168.44
they're all

4165.799 --> 4172.06
linear steps it's like the Four Horsemen

4168.44 --> 4172.0599999999995
of the Apocalypse remember that

4173.299 --> 4184.219
so in Globe fanaticism you find Marxist

4180.799 --> 4188.7789999999995
communist thinking

4184.219 --> 4191.6
because it is one system

4188.779 --> 4196.160000000001
started with the overthrow of Christ

4191.6 --> 4198.9800000000005
the reversal of the physical reality

4196.16 --> 4202.219
and reason with that

4198.98 --> 4205.639999999999
and then like the social order and

4202.219 --> 4211.179
control with Communism and then arguably

4205.64 --> 4211.179
after that transhumanism and but yeah

4211.28 --> 4216.04
I had a show about this like years ago

4216.199 --> 4221.0599999999995
but there for me there's always the same

4218.48 --> 4224.299999999999
like oh you're Global well that means

4221.06 --> 4227.1990000000005
you're also probably somehow connected

4224.3 --> 4227.1990000000005
into communism

4232.04 --> 4234.64
all right

4234.98 --> 4245.178999999999
and I'm sometimes really wondering

4238.82 --> 4249.38
was what was the typical cosmology of

4245.179 --> 4251.0
the Nazis or not even the Nazis of that

4249.38 --> 4252.4400000000005
culture

4251.0 --> 4254.659
in which

4252.44 --> 4256.58
those kind of like started to come

4254.659 --> 4259.159
together right

4256.58 --> 4261.199
did they have any consideration for

4259.159 --> 4263.86
cosmology were they like this typical

4261.199 --> 4263.86
concave

4264.8 --> 4268.42
or were they flat

4269.239 --> 4274.159
because there certainly wouldn't have

4271.64 --> 4278.08
been like globers

4274.159 --> 4280.699
like do you see like in like Nazi stuff

4278.08 --> 4283.5199999999995
Nazi propaganda I'm talking like very

4280.699 --> 4287.419999999999
early stuff like even before the war

4283.52 --> 4290.56
was that globes in all of it

4287.42 --> 4290.56
did they use that

4293.719 --> 4296.62
I'm asking

4300.98 --> 4307.28
or is that really what they converted to

4303.739 --> 4309.32
like Werner from Brown when with project

4307.28 --> 4313.5199999999995
paper clip they came to United States

4309.32 --> 4317.5599999999995
and then used their trade

4313.52 --> 4317.56
to then enforce the globe

4317.659 --> 4321.799999999999
right you don't know because I don't

4319.64 --> 4322.88
think the Nazis were about the globe at

4321.8 --> 4325.9400000000005
all

4322.88 --> 4328.82
I don't I think that well every time I

4325.94 --> 4332.78
get into contact or hear something about

4328.82 --> 4336.5599999999995
some sort of online wannabe Nazi figure

4332.78 --> 4338.48
they're always freaking concave

4336.56 --> 4340.06
but in the past

4338.48 --> 4342.739
having bumped into that like

4340.06 --> 4344.96
pre-internet will not literally pre and

4342.739 --> 4347.379999999999
but for me before I got on the internet

4344.96 --> 4347.38
more

4347.659 --> 4353.5
they didn't like really say concave

4354.86 --> 4361.339999999999
they did they did actually say flat

4359.239 --> 4366.98
so I've always been puzzled about it's

4361.34 --> 4370.64
like what did they actually think

4366.98 --> 4374.718999999999
were they like biblical approached

4370.64 --> 4378.7390000000005
like no it says it's like a sea a

4374.719 --> 4381.56
ceiling clay and it's flat like very

4378.739 --> 4384.44
basic is is that what they were going

4381.56 --> 4387.5
with or did they have more elaborate

4384.44 --> 4390.5599999999995
ideas I mean it is the time of theosophy

4387.5 --> 4392.6
as well I mean Rudolph Steiner was right

4390.56 --> 4394.820000000001
there right and talking about like the

4392.6 --> 4396.92
spirit Dimension and so

4394.82 --> 4400.719
how

4396.92 --> 4400.719
was it seen

4401.54 --> 4407.98
and what was in the propaganda where

4404.78 --> 4413.679
their globes in the propaganda did they

4407.98 --> 4413.678999999999
abide to the globe cosmology or not

4417.5 --> 4421.219
because

4418.699 --> 4424.219
I don't remember and I have seen some

4421.219 --> 4426.92
older like Nazi footage and stuff like

4424.219 --> 4429.38
propaganda Clips like animated clips of

4426.92 --> 4431.78
like really proto-looking Nazis and that

4429.38 --> 4434.54
are flying with jet packs and [ __ ] right

4431.78 --> 4436.759999999999
some of you might have seen that

4434.54 --> 4437.42
I don't remember ever seeing a glowb

4436.76 --> 4440.26
earth

4437.42 --> 4440.26
in that

4447.38 --> 4453.26
I think that they didn't

4450.86 --> 4457.339999999999
I think they didn't do that

4453.26 --> 4461.320000000001
it just left that out it didn't abide

4457.34 --> 4461.32
media wise to the globe

4467.12 --> 4472.219
it's like they didn't go along with the

4469.219 --> 4474.699
plan right 20th century plan

4472.219 --> 4477.9800000000005
20th Century Fox the whole movie

4474.699 --> 4479.78
Hollywood all the movement was like now

4477.98 --> 4482.419999999999
we're gonna put the globe and everything

4479.78 --> 4483.5599999999995
in our all the radio stations everywhere

4482.42 --> 4485.719
like that's

4483.56 --> 4487.820000000001
and the Nazis like didn't do that

4485.719 --> 4490.09
potentially like they did not go along

4487.82 --> 4493.349999999999
with it at all

4490.09 --> 4493.35
[Music]

4499.1 --> 4503.780000000001
and it's almost ironic like Werner from

4501.5 --> 4505.4
Brown then if you take take a look at

4503.78 --> 4509.239
this like this

4505.4 --> 4511.5199999999995
that he then came became part of NASA

4509.239 --> 4514.299999999999
but he still had it in his gravestone

4511.52 --> 4514.3
right like

4514.58 --> 4520.9
the Firma showed his handiwork

4518.36 --> 4524.42
why would he do that

4520.9 --> 4527.12
unless he's just doing all this

4524.42 --> 4529.28
spaceship for the American government

4527.12 --> 4531.5
because he has to

4529.28 --> 4533.78
but originally they didn't do that the

4531.5 --> 4536.3
Nazis didn't actually do that they

4533.78 --> 4539.179
didn't have a [ __ ] Space Program they

4536.3 --> 4540.92
had a rocket program sure

4539.179 --> 4543.679
right

4540.92 --> 4547.1
for bombing and [ __ ]

4543.679 --> 4549.56
as an alternative to bombers

4547.1 --> 4551.4800000000005
they tried rocketry for that purpose for

4549.56 --> 4554.26
a military purpose not for freaking

4551.48 --> 4554.259999999999
spaceship

4555.62 --> 4559.82
I think that the uh what was it again

4558.14 --> 4564.14
there was it

4559.82 --> 4568.159
the the secret space program of that

4564.14 --> 4570.9800000000005
stayed in Yugoslavia what was it again

4568.159 --> 4573.98
there is like they did that

4570.98 --> 4576.139999999999
and they were supposedly kind of

4573.98 --> 4579.199
pro-nazi

4576.14 --> 4580.54
they were like part of it right or like

4579.199 --> 4584.299999999999
another

4580.54 --> 4585.58
fascist Alliance faction type thing

4584.3 --> 4588.320000000001
right

4585.58 --> 4590.12
and they had that supposed secret space

4588.32 --> 4592.46
program

4590.12 --> 4595.42
but I mean that could also have been

4592.46 --> 4595.42
just one

4596.78 --> 4604.54
like project it's

4600.14 --> 4604.54
it's really difficult to place it all

4605.42 --> 4611.0
but I don't know any like

4608.179 --> 4613.4
propaganda from the Nazis like with

4611.0 --> 4616.34
animation and [ __ ] where there would be

4613.4 --> 4618.58
Globe Earth space recognition of

4616.34 --> 4618.58
anything

4621.26 --> 4628.280000000001
right I'm sure like later there has been

4623.9 --> 4631.46
inspired stuff I mean we got like

4628.28 --> 4634.58
uh the iron uh

4631.46 --> 4637.34
a crazy movie where like the Nazis have

4634.58 --> 4639.64
a secret space or a secret moon base and

4637.34 --> 4639.64
[ __ ]

4639.679 --> 4645.26
right but that's all much later like

4642.5 --> 4648.76
that's basically proper yeah science

4645.26 --> 4648.76
fiction inspired propaganda

4650.9 --> 4656.0
right

4653.0 --> 4656.0
interpolar

4667.719 --> 4674.659
yeah derp alert indeed

4671.739 --> 4678.199
calculate the distance ballistics using

4674.659 --> 4680.679
a spherical geometry is

4678.199 --> 4680.678999999999
no

4680.719 --> 4684.26
music correct

4682.1 --> 4686.900000000001
create coordinate system which is flat

4684.26 --> 4688.88
it's like a flat Square that's what they

4686.9 --> 4691.82
actually use

4688.88 --> 4694.719
yeah nothing uses spherical geometry

4691.82 --> 4694.719
nothing

4695.56 --> 4703.52
uses spherical geometry

4700.219 --> 4705.86
in in actual engineering and Chip it

4703.52 --> 4709.120000000001
only happens in astrophysics and

4705.86 --> 4709.12
astronomy [ __ ]

4710.239 --> 4716.239
yeah and it shouldn't it's all that just

4713.84 --> 4720.02
to justify how it doesn't work

4716.239 --> 4723.199
spherical geometry isn't used

4720.02 --> 4725.84
in physical reality moon rover

4723.199 --> 4729.5599999999995
you realize that right

4725.84 --> 4731.4800000000005
it's a hyper conceptual mathematical

4729.56 --> 4735.46
idea

4731.48 --> 4735.459999999999
that's never used

4737.12 --> 4740.5
hey Google virus

4743.719 --> 4750.02
in glorious bastards is that the movie

4746.9 --> 4751.94
where they go to a moon base in space I

4750.02 --> 4754.540000000001
don't think so in glorious bad it is a

4751.94 --> 4757.28
propaganda [ __ ] but it's just like

4754.54 --> 4758.659
supposedly taking place in World War II

4757.28 --> 4762.219
that's not

4758.659 --> 4762.219
the one where it's like

4764.48 --> 4769.4
they all have to like every country

4766.699 --> 4773.419999999999
sends their spaceships

4769.4 --> 4775.58
to go after something with the Moon

4773.42 --> 4780.04
right

4775.58 --> 4780.04
and then they find this Nazi base there

4781.219 --> 4786.7390000000005
with all these blonde people

4784.699 --> 4789.32
I don't know what that movie I don't

4786.739 --> 4793.0599999999995
remember what it was called it's not

4789.32 --> 4793.0599999999995
Inglorious Bastards though

4805.4 --> 4811.219
what is even spherical what you don't

4808.76 --> 4813.62
know what spherical geometry is Godzilla

4811.219 --> 4817.64
it's Circle geometry is where you use

4813.62 --> 4820.94
angles that are bent

4817.64 --> 4824.4400000000005
and yes that doesn't make any sense

4820.94 --> 4824.44

Como virus is kind of funny

4914.96 --> 4921.32
still wrong though but you know likes to

4918.32 --> 4926.299999999999
be passively wrong

4921.32 --> 4929.719
it's like oh yeah oh oh I am not going

4926.3 --> 4932.679
to agree with that passively but

4929.719 --> 4935.3
I certainly don't have any evidence to

4932.679 --> 4939.43
contradict what you said but I'm gonna

4935.3 --> 4942.469
be passive like that that's a Kubo virus

[Music]

4954.58 --> 4963.58
these spheres do exist though right yeah

4958.699 --> 4963.58
no physical spheres definitely exist

4977.06 --> 4983.780000000001
claim geometry sphere yeah but that's

4979.82 --> 4985.78
sphere geometry that's like the geometry

4983.78 --> 4990.259999999999
of a sphere

4985.78 --> 4992.84
spherical geometry is not the same thing

4990.26 --> 4995.06
lumpy gas in a vacuum that that's the

4992.84 --> 4997.88
trick isn't it it's not the geometry of

4995.06 --> 5000.280000000001
a sphere like the geometry of the plane

4997.88 --> 5002.14
you have planar geometry

5000.28 --> 5006.219
they have spherical geometry and

5002.14 --> 5010.360000000001
spherical geometry Works differently

5006.219 --> 5014.699
right it's not the sizing up of a sphere

5010.36 --> 5014.699
is the sizing up of the surface

5014.98 --> 5019.799999999999
of what you presume to be as Fair

5020.44 --> 5025.249
ah

5027.1 --> 5031.179
even though you actually are measuring a

flat plane see

5031.179 --> 5036.9400000000005
it's more like spherical geometry is

5033.4 --> 5039.58
more like the mathematical justification

5036.94 --> 5042.82
on how to

5039.58 --> 5044.32
think of a flat plane

5042.82 --> 5046.54
as is fair

5044.32 --> 5048.82
that's really what spherical geometry is

5046.54 --> 5051.76
all about

5048.82 --> 5054.099999999999
and that's how they use it to justify

5051.76 --> 5057.659000000001
why things are perfectly flat and how

5054.1 --> 5057.659000000001
that still means it's a sphere

5074.38 --> 5079.38
thank you

5075.64 --> 5081.64
how the Germans used Fe well first off

5079.38 --> 5085.3

5086.44 --> 5090.5199999999995
nobody's gonna tell me differently not

5088.6 --> 5093.159000000001
even the [ __ ] military if they do

5090.52 --> 5096.120000000001
they're probably paid Liars just to keep

5093.159 --> 5096.12
that undercover

5098.26 --> 5107.34
okay but I'm talking about specifically

5102.12 --> 5110.8
what they told the people

5107.34 --> 5113.62
not like what they believed it's like

5110.8 --> 5116.7390000000005
what is in their media the media what

5113.62 --> 5118.84
does the media say what does the man on

5116.739 --> 5121.178999999999
the radio say what was the television

5118.84 --> 5123.6990000000005
saying what do the cartoons say what do

5121.179 --> 5126.04
they say do they say it's a globe is

5123.699 --> 5129.58
there a globe there does the globe keep

5126.04 --> 5132.179
coming back or isn't it they don't show

5129.58 --> 5132.179
the globe

5132.219 --> 5135.42
that's my question

5135.64 --> 5141.159000000001
because they sure as hell were operating

5138.219 --> 5143.44
in the military using a flat plane

5141.159 --> 5145.78
because the Earth is flat and if they

5143.44 --> 5148.5
didn't use that then their equipment

5145.78 --> 5148.5
wouldn't work

5154.659 --> 5159.879999999999
and they would be off with their

5157.12 --> 5161.86
freaking aims all the time

5159.88 --> 5163.6
like shooting their cannons at distance

5161.86 --> 5165.4
like that doesn't work if you're gonna

5163.6 --> 5167.56
go with spherical geometry you're just

5165.4 --> 5169.78
gonna miss always right Globe Earth

not having proof doesn't mean that they

5450.28 --> 5455.099999999999
can't think of it as having proof right

to that thing

is so first deism

5529.26 --> 5532.659000000001
a god

5531.219 --> 5537.52
and then

5532.659 --> 5539.259999999999
faith in human so man man you have faith

5537.52 --> 5541.4800000000005
in man

5539.26 --> 5544.54
you believe man

5541.48 --> 5545.678999999999
not but I thought you were Deus like

you seem to be

5576.34 --> 5581.139
face that man will keep making up [ __ ]

5579.159 --> 5584.679
forever

5581.139 --> 5587.08
I have faith that the globe lore can

5584.679 --> 5590.08
keep developing

5587.08 --> 5592.48
despite it being so blatantly fake so

5590.08 --> 5595.48
yeah I have faith in man

5592.48 --> 5598.959999999999
I faith in her creativity

5595.48 --> 5601.419999999999
and our tenaciousness and holding on to

5598.96 --> 5606.42
delusions

5601.42 --> 5606.42
and ignoring our conscious insights

5606.58 --> 5610.8
I faith that humans do that

I don't trust it though

5614.739 --> 5617.459999999999
you see

5618.219 --> 5624.639
I don't trust a person

5621.4 --> 5627.58
because they had an idea

5624.639 --> 5632.02
I might trust the idea

5627.58 --> 5636.58
because the idea is not the person

5632.02 --> 5639.6990000000005
I trust the idea not the person

5636.58 --> 5642.639
and if a person has a lot of good ideas

5639.699 --> 5645.96
coming out of that then then that's what

5642.639 --> 5645.96
I can trust about them

5646.179 --> 5650.1
yeah because I trust what is

5650.739 --> 5656.32
not what I

5653.56 --> 5658.54
imagine could be

5656.32 --> 5659.739
I trust what is not what I imagine could

5658.54 --> 5662.26
be

5659.739 --> 5665.44
although I'd love to speculate about

5662.26 --> 5667.84
what I think could be right I don't

5665.44 --> 5671.86
trust on that I don't just lean on it

5667.84 --> 5674.38
that's why I don't suddenly reify things

5671.86 --> 5678.099999999999
dramatically say like I'm absolutely

5674.38 --> 5680.62
like I know this is absolutely true

5678.1 --> 5684.52
like for example the looping nature of

5680.62 --> 5687.46
the realm I've I've a very

5684.52 --> 5691.2390000000005
good feeling about it

5687.46 --> 5696.179
and also I know it's a claim that can be

5691.239 --> 5699.5199999999995
falsified it can be tested to be proven

5696.179 --> 5702.58
correct or incorrect and I'm very happy

5699.52 --> 5705.580000000001
that I at least am gambling on something

5702.58 --> 5706.62
that can be proven I'm not like oh I'm

5705.58 --> 5710.08
gonna

5706.62 --> 5712.54
gamble on this thing that can never ever

5710.08 --> 5715.0199999999995
be proven no

5712.54 --> 5717.219
like the upward Rising Earth [ __ ]

5715.02 --> 5721.9800000000005
literally can never be proven yeah

5717.219 --> 5721.9800000000005
that's why like yeah don't touch that

5724.54 --> 5729.219
why would I gamble on something that can

5726.82 --> 5731.699
never be tested

it's you

oh quite a few people here actually for

5759.219 --> 5763.56
my show is doing

5760.78 --> 5763.5599999999995
my little

5763.679 --> 5767.6990000000005
ignored corner on the internet

5787.3 --> 5793.7390000000005
like seeing people help others gives

5790.3 --> 5793.7390000000005
faith in humanity

5794.56 --> 5800.26
so

5797.139 --> 5803.9800000000005
you see people helping others and that

5800.26 --> 5803.9800000000005
makes them trustworthy

5804.28 --> 5809.679
don't you know that people it's very

5807.699 --> 5811.659
historically known that

5809.679 --> 5814.06
when you get

5811.659 --> 5816.099999999999
people helping you

5814.06 --> 5818.080000000001
there's a chance that at the end of the

5816.1 --> 5820.360000000001
road they want something from you and

5818.08 --> 5823.32
they're planning towards that you you

5820.36 --> 5823.32
know that right

5825.34 --> 5830.38
I mean help is great it's like yeah

5828.52 --> 5831.639
without it everything would crumble for

5830.38 --> 5833.9800000000005
sure

5831.639 --> 5836.9800000000005
but I mean that doesn't make them

5833.98 --> 5836.98
trustworthy

5838.659 --> 5844.9
it's not about trust oh really so you

5841.96 --> 5847.78
don't trust in man then Akuma virus

5844.9 --> 5849.82
because you did kind of say yeah do you

5847.78 --> 5853.199
have faith in man so that means that you

5849.82 --> 5853.199
trust them right

5867.06 --> 5875.639
paying for a person's groceries

5870.58 --> 5875.639
mean you want something from them

5876.4 --> 5881.5
its kind Acts

5879.46 --> 5886.4800000000005
sure

5881.5 --> 5889.06
but a kind act is also

5886.48 --> 5892.678999999999
is not selfless

5889.06 --> 5892.679
people say that it isn't

5893.86 --> 5900.219
you do kindly kind Acts or you do also

5897.639 --> 5903.78
for yourself

5900.219 --> 5903.78
you'd be a fool not to

5904.3 --> 5909.42
yeah kindness is a form of self-defense

5910.78 --> 5917.259999999999
and some peoples even apply that so much

5914.44 --> 5918.82
that even when they hate somebody they

5917.26 --> 5920.92
still are kind

5918.82 --> 5923.58
because they have to do that it's like

5920.92 --> 5923.58
their culture

5924.699 --> 5929.678999999999
yeah

5927.04 --> 5932.86
how does that make them trustworthy how

5929.679 --> 5934.4800000000005
can you now trust what they have to say

5932.86 --> 5936.159
right

5934.48 --> 5939.159
I mean

5936.159 --> 5942.699
Earth is not a ball akumo virus people

5939.159 --> 5946.239
have come together organized

5942.699 --> 5948.339999999999
and studied man and their habits and

5946.239 --> 5951.339999999999
their ways of thinking for a long time

5948.34 --> 5952.719
to bring you this religion of the ball

5951.34 --> 5956.82
Earth

5952.719 --> 5956.82
that arised through Catholicism

5957.28 --> 5960.3
and into government

5960.58 --> 5966.639
and it's people telling you that it is

5963.699 --> 5968.678999999999
that people telling you that that's the

5966.639 --> 5970.719
faith you have to have if you believe in

5968.679 --> 5973.92
that if you believe in the globe then

5970.719 --> 5973.92
you have faith in man

5974.26 --> 5980.92
then you trust them

5977.199 --> 5983.5
because that's where the only proof lies

5980.92 --> 5987.76
in the trust of what people have to say

5983.5 --> 5990.4
about it because every empirical and

5987.76 --> 5994.659000000001
logical assessment

5990.4 --> 5997.599999999999
will prove that it's not a globe

5994.659 --> 6000.9
so the only thing you can hold on to

5997.6 --> 6003.900000000001
is on trusting men that tell you it's

6000.9 --> 6006.42
globe Akuma virus

with Godzilla telling you it's not a

6062.639 --> 6066.179
globe

6064.32 --> 6068.28
and so I

6066.179 --> 6071.76
told you that yeah if you have faith in

6068.28 --> 6075.659
men so you trust them then

6071.76 --> 6077.76
because that is where the globe faith

6075.659 --> 6080.4
comes from

6077.76 --> 6082.8
if the Arbiters of the religion they

6080.4 --> 6086.04
have official statements

6082.8 --> 6088.860000000001
they have official data supposedly

6086.04 --> 6091.1
pictures that they give you and stories

6088.86 --> 6093.839999999999
accompanied with them official stories

6091.1 --> 6095.58
and yeah they seem ridiculous but that's

6093.84 --> 6097.139
what you're gonna get and that's what

6095.58 --> 6100.679
you gotta take

6097.139 --> 6103.86
if you want to hold on

6100.679 --> 6106.139
to the Earth being globe

6103.86 --> 6108.259999999999
because empirically

6106.139 --> 6112.34
logically

6108.26 --> 6112.34
geometrically there's no evidence

6114.239 --> 6118.099999999999
and that was the point that I was making

6118.56 --> 6122.719
alright see you later hello fruit yeah

6120.42 --> 6122.719
thanks

6132.9 --> 6137.54
umari is a whole meaning we can do

6135.3 --> 6137.54
better

6143.04 --> 6146.48
I'm not sure we can

6146.88 --> 6153.719
I mean but Humanities definitely has has

6150.179 --> 6156.719
its ups as well as its Downs

6153.719 --> 6159.3
and there's potential there

6156.719 --> 6162.2390000000005
but it doesn't mean that we can all just

6159.3 --> 6166.5
always be better

6162.239 --> 6169.218999999999
at least not in the setting that we're

6166.5 --> 6169.219
living in

6173.28 --> 6179.94
like there is gonna be a lot of people

6175.98 --> 6181.5199999999995
that won't just because they will be

6179.94 --> 6184.659
defiant

6181.52 --> 6184.659000000001
[Music]

6186.54 --> 6189.84
so yeah there's potential but that

6188.28 --> 6193.5199999999995
doesn't mean that that potential is

6189.84 --> 6193.52
gonna like permanently manifest

6193.92 --> 6199.56
you could rather compare it to humanity

6196.679 --> 6203.2390000000005
can have its moments I think that's a

6199.56 --> 6203.2390000000005
much more honest assessment

6220.8 --> 6224.820000000001
you have faith in manual I have faith in

6223.02 --> 6228.179
logic

6224.82 --> 6230.88
and really logic alone

6228.179 --> 6234.4800000000005
if logic is in people

6230.88 --> 6235.9800000000005
then I trust them because they have

6234.48 --> 6239.28
logic

6235.98 --> 6242.58
if logic is abandoned within people then

6239.28 --> 6246.119
I know that I can't trust them that much

6242.58 --> 6248.699
because they live in chaos

6246.119 --> 6252.0599999999995
it's logic there's chaos

6248.699 --> 6255.678999999999
now of course chaos is perception

6252.06 --> 6257.88
because somebody that's really

6255.679 --> 6261.0
intense and smart

6257.88 --> 6263.34
and cares can definitely completely

6261.0 --> 6265.98
figure out and predict somebody that

6263.34 --> 6268.8
lives in total chaos because the chaos

6265.98 --> 6271.138999999999
is mostly for themselves

6268.8 --> 6273.360000000001
when you see things as chaos that means

6271.139 --> 6275.88
that you don't have oversight and you

6273.36 --> 6278.5199999999995
relinquish control it's out of your

6275.88 --> 6281.9400000000005
hands okay the definite definition of

6278.52 --> 6284.219
chaos is that it's out of your hands

6281.94 --> 6288.08
so if it's not out of your hands anymore

6284.219 --> 6288.08
then it's not really chaos

6289.44 --> 6297.678999999999
because chaos is perception or rather

6292.56 --> 6300.659000000001
the lack thereof the lack of perception

6297.679 --> 6302.52
disables you from seeing the patterns in

6300.659 --> 6304.259999999999
the oversight getting a grip on what

6302.52 --> 6306.119000000001
things are and how they are and how they

6304.26 --> 6310.320000000001
work and how they will be

6306.119 --> 6312.78
and then to your mind it turns into a

6310.32 --> 6315.0
chaos that becomes from your perception

6312.78 --> 6318.0
unpredictable

6315.0 --> 6320.9
actual chaos doesn't really exist it's a

6318.0 --> 6320.9
perceptional thing

6321.38 --> 6326.54
all right

6323.94 --> 6326.54
anyway

6336.98 --> 6343.619
yes akumu virus I got it already you

6341.1 --> 6346.4400000000005
don't have to now start telling me that

6343.619 --> 6348.86
[ __ ] I just I literally all just explain

6346.44 --> 6348.86
it

6350.639 --> 6357.2390000000005
yeah I use your sentence I I know that's

6354.36 --> 6359.82
not what you meant akumovirus can can we

6357.239 --> 6363.119
declare about that when you said I have

6359.82 --> 6366.719
faith in humanity I know

6363.119 --> 6370.0199999999995
you didn't mean I trust in what humans

6366.719 --> 6372.179
have to say absolutely I know you didn't

6370.02 --> 6374.9400000000005
mean that you don't have to keep

6372.179 --> 6378.9
re-saying that okay

6374.94 --> 6381.379999999999
are we clear on that I just use your

6378.9 --> 6381.379999999999
statement

6381.78 --> 6389.82
to parallel build with that and then

6385.56 --> 6393.06
highlight how you are unbewittingly not

6389.82 --> 6395.639
tied into your statement trusting in man

6393.06 --> 6399.119000000001
for your belief about the shape of the

6395.639 --> 6403.56
earth that was what I was doing

6399.119 --> 6408.86
you don't need to point out

6403.56 --> 6408.860000000001
what it was and what you meant all right

6423.36 --> 6428.94
it's just very ironic when you say

6426.239 --> 6431.959999999999
something like that and oh I explain

6428.94 --> 6431.96
exactly why

6437.52 --> 6442.219
to me it sounded like a Freudian slip

6443.1 --> 6446.780000000001
that's why it played into it

6448.38 --> 6453.7390000000005
it did explain why I explain exactly why

6455.58 --> 6459.98
the globe is Faith in man

6466.04 --> 6472.26
telling you it works like this even

6469.32 --> 6474.42
though you can't make sense of it

6472.26 --> 6480.0
even though there's no logic to it even

6474.42 --> 6480.0
though it defies tangible reality

6484.56 --> 6490.02
it is nothing to do with the glove no no

6487.619 --> 6492.179
it did

6490.02 --> 6494.159000000001
indirectly

6492.179 --> 6496.679
are you just gonna whine and complain

6494.159 --> 6498.9
about it now because I absolutely I

6496.679 --> 6501.36
literally spent 15 [ __ ] minutes

6498.9 --> 6504.9
explaining it a kumu virus

6501.36 --> 6508.199
don't suddenly now unplug your heirs

6504.9 --> 6511.58
for [ __ ] sake man

6508.199 --> 6511.58
just listen back then

6511.739 --> 6516.718999999999
I know what you were talking about I

6514.38 --> 6518.76
already explained that what the [ __ ]

6516.719 --> 6521.0
wrong with you

6518.76 --> 6521.0
foreign

6537.06 --> 6542.46
so can you stop keeping bringing up that

6540.48 --> 6545.099999999999
statement that you said

6542.46 --> 6547.199
I'm not talking about the statement that

6545.1 --> 6549.900000000001
you said so stop keep bringing it up

6547.199 --> 6552.119
okay Akuma virus I'm not talking about

6549.9 --> 6556.44
the statement yeah

6552.119 --> 6558.799999999999
not talking about what you said is that

6556.44 --> 6558.799999999999
clear

6567.239 --> 6572.699
I told you I merely used it as a

6570.179 --> 6576.92
stepping stone

6572.699 --> 6576.919999999999
because I thought it was kind of ironic

6584.39 --> 6587.409000000001
[Music]

6591.02 --> 6596.4800000000005
like teachers helping children to learn

6593.88 --> 6596.4800000000005
terrible

6597.84 --> 6600.84
foreign

6601.199 --> 6604.46
I hated that

6605.94 --> 6610.199
I mean

6607.86 --> 6612.36
for me it's like leave me the [ __ ] alone

6610.199 --> 6614.46
stop trying to indoctrinate me when I

6612.36 --> 6616.259999999999
was a little kid it's like I want to

6614.46 --> 6620.78
just hear about the globe I just want to

6616.26 --> 6620.780000000001
hear about it don't tell me how to think

6624.3 --> 6628.92
and like when they were talking about

6626.28 --> 6631.259999999999
Coriolis effect and all that I would

6628.92 --> 6633.179
just tell like shut up just I don't want

6631.26 --> 6635.159000000001
it when I didn't shut up but I would

6633.179 --> 6638.4
just wouldn't listen I'm just like no

6635.159 --> 6640.619
I'll just trust that it's a globe

6638.4 --> 6642.659
leave me alone don't tell me anything

6640.619 --> 6643.98
about it like I don't want to hear why

6642.659 --> 6645.54
it's a globe

6643.98 --> 6648.0
and I'm talking about when I was a

6645.54 --> 6649.92
little kid I'm just like let me just

6648.0 --> 6652.02
I'll just go with the space stuff and

6649.92 --> 6653.639
it's all very cool and imagery I want to

6652.02 --> 6655.9800000000005
see more planet images I always thought

6653.639 --> 6658.86
it was beautiful I liked painting Globes

6655.98 --> 6662.4
when I was a little kid yeah I love that

6658.86 --> 6664.92
[ __ ] but like leave me alone with your

6662.4 --> 6668.28
crazy [ __ ] and telling me Oh gravity

6664.92 --> 6670.7390000000005
is all relative and oh you know gravity

6668.28 --> 6673.5
when you jump off a bill like leave me

6670.739 --> 6675.239
alone as a little kid I was already like

6673.5 --> 6677.699
I

6675.239 --> 6680.04
like no

6677.699 --> 6682.86
you already told me I have to think of

6680.04 --> 6685.199
it as a globe so I will do that

6682.86 --> 6687.259999999999
but don't tell me all that other crazy

6685.199 --> 6690.48
[ __ ]

6687.26 --> 6691.8
I don't want to hear it it sounds very

6690.48 --> 6695.218999999999
damaging

6691.8 --> 6698.58
like I had the sense as a kid to know

6695.219 --> 6701.46
like this is damaging to me

6698.58 --> 6704.0599999999995
and I felt that with a lot of this NASA

6701.46 --> 6704.06
[ __ ]

6704.46 --> 6710.4
even though I was like yeah space but

6707.94 --> 6712.08
then like the real stuff happens and you

6710.4 --> 6715.82
like

6712.08 --> 6715.82
this is so [ __ ] miserable

6716.34 --> 6722.639
it seems so

6719.159 --> 6726.54
like a dud it's like it's not real

6722.639 --> 6728.400000000001
like how can they be acting like this if

6726.54 --> 6731.96
it was all real

6728.4 --> 6731.96
just doesn't make any sense

6732.48 --> 6739.5
so I'd be like leave me alone

6735.239 --> 6744.08
like get away from me NASA you're making

6739.5 --> 6744.08
it harder for me to believe in the globe

6745.5 --> 6751.26
it's not even ironic

6747.42 --> 6754.32
saying that that that's what that was

6751.26 --> 6756.659000000001
like no I I wanted to believe in the

6754.32 --> 6760.88
globe but NASA was just like

6756.659 --> 6760.879999999999
so it's just something so wrong about it

6771.08 --> 6775.5199999999995
right I'm gonna round out the show

6773.28 --> 6775.5199999999995
