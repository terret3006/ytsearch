of your faults anyway yeah the weather

89.77 --> 102.429
today is really warm it's like really

97.78 --> 108.46000000000001
really warm now that doesn't seem to be

102.429 --> 111.509
uh any kind of wind almost barely look

108.46 --> 111.509
at the blossoming tree

122.51 --> 129.45000000000002
so yeah it feels like a warm summer day

125.84 --> 137.88
almost this would be a pretty good

129.45 --> 140.45
summer day and yeah right it's like that

137.88 --> 143.79
in the UK as well

140.45 --> 147.20999999999998
hey the summer is technically not here

143.79 --> 150.57
yet it's just a very nice surprisingly

147.21 --> 153.6
nice spring day for April

150.57 --> 158.43
I guess that all the stormy weather all

153.6 --> 160.62
came in March and yeah usually that

158.43 --> 163.05
comes in April in the Netherlands it's

160.62 --> 165.54
like even there's a saying for that but

163.05 --> 172.05
I guess that April just wanted to be

165.54 --> 177.89999999999998
really nice weather this year so yeah

172.05 --> 179.85000000000002
enjoying it let's he wasn't yet okay ESP

177.9 --> 184.22

hyperactive all right I don't know I've

228.52 --> 234.43
said that for all icky you might want to

230.35 --> 246.22
consider just go outside and go jumping

234.43 --> 247.0
or something hello da GD 101 yeah it's

246.22 --> 251.76
Sunday

247.0 --> 256.81
and it's a really nice sunny day and

251.76 --> 261.71999999999997
it's so weird man it's like why why is

256.81 --> 261.72
the church still closed I don't get it I

263.4 --> 266.82
don't get it

269.93 --> 287.889
kind of disappoint me but oh well it's

277.639 --> 287.889
their business so let's see

289.18 --> 299.24
yeah yesterday yeah when did I go with

295.19 --> 301.31
the mid-late not that late wasn't that

299.24 --> 303.8
bad but yeah there was a lot of own

301.31 --> 306.53000000000003
Benjamin going on and he was just he had

303.8 --> 310.73
another yeah he had a grab her piano

306.53 --> 313.64
session and was just so so funny

310.73 --> 316.94
it hurt my guts from laughing at some

313.64 --> 322.90999999999997
boy captain going it going it was

316.94 --> 326.54
amazing a boma flat ghetto fish a long

322.91 --> 337.22
time let see anyway it got green tea

326.54 --> 339.88
with me right away yeah people are

337.22 --> 347.75
worried it doesn't make any sense though

339.88 --> 352.31
it makes no damn sense like I don't

347.75 --> 356.51
think anybody here really knows anyone

352.31 --> 358.07
in person that is like specifically

356.51 --> 361.64
dying from the I think that's

358.07 --> 364.64
everybody's figuring it out and like the

361.64 --> 367.21999999999997
direct there's doctors coming out with

364.64 --> 372.91999999999996
now saying yeah the statistics have been

367.22 --> 375.5
written I witnessed that and so yeah the

372.92 --> 378.02000000000004
fear keeps on being hyped through all

375.5 --> 381.08
the media sources they just keep going

378.02 --> 383.12
with it it's like people yeah yeah

381.08 --> 384.8
things are coming down and predictions

383.12 --> 387.11
and then they load oh it's worse it's

384.8 --> 392.33
getting worse they just keep on pushing

387.11 --> 395.39
against everything it's like the media

392.33 --> 399.78999999999996
is pushing it there it's pushing it even

395.39 --> 406.64
in the face of the program almost

399.79 --> 408.92
pushing it too much he I I don't know it

406.64 --> 412.64
just doesn't seem to be very consistent

408.92 --> 415.33000000000004
anymore as to any kind of vision as to

412.64 --> 415.33
where it's going

415.36 --> 424.84000000000003
it's weird well you know where they want

421.84 --> 426.52
to go it's Bailey Bill Gates very

424.84 --> 429.25
obvious but they were you know what they

426.52 --> 432.419
want but I don't see any way that that's

429.25 --> 438.189
really gonna work that way anymore

432.419 --> 440.43899999999996
like that it's like they offer to other

438.189 --> 443.56
people said before like it almost seems

440.439 --> 450.90000000000003
like it's broken like the system has

443.56 --> 450.9
broken yet it's still going it's weird

453.99 --> 457.129
[Music]

457.37 --> 470.26
I don't know why why would they do that

464.18 --> 473.03000000000003
by the way is this pushing towards a

470.26 --> 475.96999999999997
reformation of Internet free speech in

473.03 --> 479.09
some way is the fake news is the media

475.97 --> 482.51000000000005
the persistent [ __ ] are they gonna be

479.09 --> 484.669
the pretext are they doing this is the

482.51 --> 487.699
media doing this to gain control over

484.669 --> 491.63
free speech because you know they are

487.699 --> 494.36
well simpering the free thinkers that's

491.63 --> 498.919
another matter but are they pushing like

494.36 --> 502.46000000000004
too far and crisis act situations and

498.919 --> 506.33
just direct statistics and hyping

502.46 --> 509.40999999999997
clearly false data on the people is that

506.33 --> 515.15
gonna inevitably lead to some kind of

509.41 --> 517.4
big crackdown on media because I think

515.15 --> 519.8
that that may be actually the plan that

517.4 --> 522.62
they are literally trying to break the

519.8 --> 526.3389999999999
system so that there will be some big

522.62 --> 529.19
clamp down with their misbehavior as the

526.339 --> 534.1700000000001
pretext and I'm not talking about just

529.19 --> 536.4200000000001
basic web censorship or gatekeeping

534.17 --> 539.029
narrowing down the street the stream

536.42 --> 540.9799999999999
whatever the availability you know

539.029 --> 543.68
that's already being done out but that's

540.98 --> 546.38
like policy that those are policy

543.68 --> 549.3199999999999
effects because the free speech system

546.38 --> 553.37
is technically still legally in place so

549.32 --> 557.2090000000001
are they pushing too far specifically to

553.37 --> 559.91
kind of destroy the very foundations of

557.209 --> 562.16
free speech is that why they're doing it

559.91 --> 564.9499999999999
it makes sense from a satanic

562.16 --> 566.209
perspective because they don't care they

564.95 --> 569.0600000000001
don't really care they just care about

566.209 --> 572.93
the money and the power they don't care

569.06 --> 576.02
about the consequences not really so

572.93 --> 582.0799999999999
maybe it is pushing to that that's that

576.02 --> 584.5699999999999
could be extremely bad it's kind of

582.08 --> 587.3290000000001
typical down the lane of control you

584.57 --> 588.7090000000001
know make everybody chair you finally

587.329 --> 590.7099999999999
something's gonna be done about that

588.709 --> 593.1999999999999
blasted fake news like ever

590.71 --> 595.3000000000001
we'll eventually be like yeah finally

593.2 --> 597.1600000000001
but what do you think how they're they

595.3 --> 599.14
going to do it what do you think the the

597.16 --> 604.8389999999999
wider consequences will be when they do

599.14 --> 606.8199999999999
it yes now you got a problem and it kind

604.839 --> 612.339
of was a problem that was always there

606.82 --> 616.9300000000001
from the start with free speech because

612.339 --> 621.49
free speech only really works when there

616.93 --> 625.93
when the general public is has enough

621.49 --> 628.6
logos to defend it properly because if

625.93 --> 631.42
they don't they stop doing that then the

628.6 --> 638.07
Dark One's take control and they ruin it

631.42 --> 638.0699999999999
to take it away see

645.4 --> 648.539
[Music]

651.04 --> 658.48
but but you do I hope you guys

653.29 --> 662.8
understand the pattern of this you know

658.48 --> 666.91
a media that is kind of doing bad things

662.8 --> 669.5799999999999
being uncovered effectively yeah of

666.91 --> 676.66
course they're gonna push back some but

669.58 --> 679.4200000000001
if they would really want to stay there

676.66 --> 681.52
on the long run and adapt to a

679.42 --> 685.27
transformation they wouldn't be doing

681.52 --> 687.67
this they're doing this to break it I'm

685.27 --> 693.13
almost certain of this otherwise they

687.67 --> 697.0899999999999
would stop they're not they're not

693.13 --> 700.62
stopping they keep on shoving the

697.09 --> 700.62
numbers keep on rehire

702.15 --> 709.18
it's almost like every country that has

704.71 --> 710.59
ever tapped into Corona ever admitted to

709.18 --> 713.56
it being a problem of it or even

710.59 --> 715.69
existing they will just be subjected to

713.56 --> 724.4799999999999
these games through their Corona games

715.69 --> 726.4300000000001
and it ended yeah like yeah the media's

724.48 --> 735.46
just doesn't seem to really stop doesn't

726.43 --> 736.9599999999999
seem to cooperate truly but maybe I

735.46 --> 739.69
don't know maybe that's just another

736.96 --> 743.5500000000001
layer of the game maybe yeah governments

739.69 --> 748.1800000000001
are well maybe yeah like I said

743.55 --> 750.6999999999999
government's plan to let this happen to

748.18 --> 755.1099999999999
crackdown on free speech using taking

750.7 --> 761.8900000000001
down fake news as an excuse I think we

755.11 --> 765.96
should guard for this with great and

761.89 --> 770.23
with eyes wide open great vigilance

765.96 --> 774.9300000000001
because this is bound to happen in some

770.23 --> 774.9300000000001
way I have to be careful everywhere

776.42 --> 785.4599999999999
so yeah everybody just keep doing what

784.02 --> 787.77
you're doing and and do it as

785.46 --> 792.24
responsible as you can and don't go with

787.77 --> 793.8
fear and you know every there's there's

792.24 --> 797.97
like already trick questions going

793.8 --> 801.74
around it's the same situation as with

797.97 --> 804.0
911 there's now these specific like

801.74 --> 806.76
troll types going around that are

804.0 --> 809.4
fishing for accusations because they

806.76 --> 811.68
want to register people saying specific

809.4 --> 816.24
things so they think that they can use

811.68 --> 818.25
that afterward the forward to whoever's

816.24 --> 820.47
gonna take it all down so they have a

818.25 --> 826.02
list of accusations so what they want

820.47 --> 829.26
people the kind of spill or say be on

826.02 --> 831.27
record saying is Corona is a fake it

829.26 --> 835.41
doesn't exist they want that

831.27 --> 840.99
specifically to be on record but because

835.41 --> 845.13
it's technically not true right because

840.99 --> 847.589
it's not about Corona a virus or that

845.13 --> 847.98
it's engineered whether that is true or

847.589 --> 849.44
not

847.98 --> 851.97
now that entire thing is completely

849.44 --> 854.8800000000001
irrelevant to the entire setup of what

851.97 --> 857.82
is going on because yeah the corona

854.88 --> 859.8
viruses do exist and probably some

857.82 --> 862.44
laboratory probably did try to fool

859.8 --> 866.55
around with that but yeah the issue is

862.44 --> 868.6500000000001
is that viruses simply are not what the

866.55 --> 871.1999999999999
mainstream medical system claims they

868.65 --> 875.31
are in the first place that is the issue

871.2 --> 878.37
not that Corona a virus thingy does not

875.31 --> 881.67
exist no it's just the scenario that's

878.37 --> 885.98
been latched on to it does not exist and

881.67 --> 890.5799999999999
it's very similar to certain other

885.98 --> 894.5
scientific details I've gone around for

890.58 --> 897.6600000000001
example the concept of gravity you know

894.5 --> 900.63
there is an alignment there you know

897.66 --> 903.42
little G gravity the the actual gravity

900.63 --> 906.12
it does exist it's an effect caused by

903.42 --> 908.61
relative density it is effectively the

906.12 --> 910.589
effect that comes out of the whole thing

908.61 --> 913.799
which reveals an alignment and that

910.589 --> 917.85
alignment could be considered cost or

913.799 --> 921.36
yeah to be gravity that align the

917.85 --> 924.149
gravity is the alignment that off

921.36 --> 925.799
relative density but because there's

924.149 --> 928.379
been all these stories about mass

925.799 --> 930.48
attracting massive rumors did not claim

928.379 --> 933.98
no hypothesis and this conceptual

930.48 --> 937.009
mediums to supposedly latch on to more

933.98 --> 939.509
frameworks of displacement why

937.009 --> 942.119
supposedly that's so conceptual that has

939.509 --> 944.519
all been latched on to that and then

942.119 --> 948.5690000000001
some people may come say oh what you

944.519 --> 951.54
don't believe gravity exists and then if

948.569 --> 954.299
you just say no then technically you are

951.54 --> 956.819
also incorrect technically but it's like

954.299 --> 959.389
a judicial matter because when ballers

956.819 --> 963.179
say they think of the entire universe

959.389 --> 965.61
framework and of mass attracted to mass

963.179 --> 968.519
but that's really not the technical

965.61 --> 971.249
gravity the technical gravity is the

968.519 --> 978.299
alignment the effect caused by relative

971.249 --> 979.529
density so if you just say gravity

978.299 --> 981.48
doesn't exist technically you're

979.529 --> 984.209
incorrect but if you just say no gravity

981.48 --> 988.799
is not that that is all fictional then

984.209 --> 992.16
they have no no foundation to accuse you

988.799 --> 996.54
with so we should keep these technical

992.16 --> 1001.399
trickery thingies in mind very carefully

996.54 --> 1005.0889999999999
it's like a judicial consciousness layer

1001.399 --> 1008.869
to protect you in an age where we're

1005.089 --> 1012.23
basically up against very dangerous mind

1008.869 --> 1017.9590000000001
controlling system you have to do this

1012.23 --> 1020.4490000000001
you have to be technically correct do

1017.959 --> 1023.9889999999999
you see so if somebody if some [ __ ]

1020.449 --> 1026.089
or whatever a troll even or a person /

1023.989 --> 1027.829
believer as you do think it doesn't

1026.089 --> 1030.11
exist they're going to be outraged if

1027.829 --> 1032.839
you just say no they're going to be oh

1030.11 --> 1038.12
my god the implications all the people

1032.839 --> 1041.23
this and then well because because of

1038.12 --> 1043.9589999999998
that because you were wrong

1041.23 --> 1046.929
are allowed karmically to be outraged

1043.959 --> 1049.75
it's their little squirt moment do you

1046.929 --> 1055.0900000000001
see so when somebody asks you does

1049.75 --> 1058.299
Corona exist you say yes you say yes it

1055.09 --> 1062.309
exists that's the start of it and then

1058.299 --> 1066.34
you say but it's not an infectious

1062.309 --> 1069.04
hostile entity that's not what it is and

1066.34 --> 1072.28
then you explain about what viruses are

1069.04 --> 1075.04
in the more understandable version that

1072.28 --> 1078.07
microbiology is a secondary system it's

1075.04 --> 1082.26
a cleanup crew system that's inherent to

1078.07 --> 1086.97
the biome on a cellular level of

1082.26 --> 1089.919
organisms especially mammal organisms so

1086.97 --> 1091.75
there you go that's what you say then

1089.919 --> 1094.5400000000002
they got nothing they have no squirt

1091.75 --> 1098.44
moment they have no secrets niching

1094.54 --> 1107.5
powers anymore that's the way you do it

1098.44 --> 1109.15
you be absolutely correct so that's what

1107.5 --> 1115.54
I'm gonna do it's one of my measures

1109.15 --> 1118.5700000000002
it's my my measures mine and it's just

1115.54 --> 1125.61
what because I had a pretty big

1118.57 --> 1130.059
revelation personally yesterday that

1125.61 --> 1131.9499999999998
yeah it has to do with my path what I'm

1130.059 --> 1136.54
doing here I talked to good servant

1131.95 --> 1138.73
about this so I think he gets it it just

1136.54 --> 1141.01
feels like I'm under pressure and I'm in

1138.73 --> 1143.02
the point like another tipping point

1141.01 --> 1146.23
it's like it's been a while since I've

1143.02 --> 1148.21
been here there's not a tipping point

1146.23 --> 1154.29
another moment where I have to choose am

1148.21 --> 1159.76
I gonna gonna continue as I have

1154.29 --> 1163.57
relaxing and joying myself trying to

1159.76 --> 1165.82
appreciate the simple things or am I

1163.57 --> 1171.24
going to compact further take more

1165.82 --> 1171.24
stress abandon more joy in a way

1171.99 --> 1177.88
to find a way through and see if now on

1175.929 --> 1180.52
the other side things are not so grim

1177.88 --> 1184.0
anymore because I do know a lot more who

1180.52 --> 1187.15
I am I do and I there's more for me on

1184.0 --> 1190.51
the other side when I do this I feel it

1187.15 --> 1194.41
I can feel it it's calling me so I have

1190.51 --> 1198.99
to kind of compress my spirit take more

1194.41 --> 1198.99
responsibility retreat

1200.25 --> 1209.38
some of the energies that I'm kind of

1203.95 --> 1213.1000000000001
used to feed on as a standard process as

1209.38 --> 1216.97
my being I have to retreat it to instead

1213.1 --> 1219.76
reroute it and compact me to create more

1216.97 --> 1222.669
stress in a way to harden certain

1219.76 --> 1226.21
elements of myself that I've let stay

1222.669 --> 1229.169
weak because first I could it was too

1226.21 --> 1232.539
weak there's nothing I can do with it I

1229.169 --> 1234.97
must strengthen these elements in myself

1232.539 --> 1240.58
or I'm just never gonna be fulfilled

1234.97 --> 1245.23
I will never find the momentum I need to

1240.58 --> 1249.01
really engage in social life again in a

1245.23 --> 1250.96
physical way because that has been it's

1249.01 --> 1253.75
kind of blocked and that's because of

1250.96 --> 1256.539
well what I do and the intellectual

1253.75 --> 1259.659
height the that's specifically designed

1256.539 --> 1261.669
to give that that room to do that to

1259.659 --> 1264.2800000000002
play around because again it is like a

1261.669 --> 1271.929
thing that has been viable to do it like

1264.28 --> 1275.799
this for me but this set of cannot

1271.929 --> 1278.679
persist forever or I will feel myself

1275.799 --> 1281.11
growing old and weak and then not being

1278.679 --> 1283.679
able to attain what I really need in is

1281.11 --> 1283.6789999999999
life anymore

1287.44 --> 1301.28
so yeah I think I'm sort off in some way

1293.65 --> 1303.89
gonna be stopping smoking again and I'm

1301.28 --> 1305.6
gonna fall back it's gonna be very very

1303.89 --> 1308.8400000000001
challenging but it's like the first time

1305.6 --> 1312.7099999999998
that I realize it's like not even about

1308.84 --> 1324.1689999999999
being financially balanced anymore it's

1312.71 --> 1328.22
about just finally building and also

1324.169 --> 1330.8300000000002
just having that challenge of I need to

1328.22 --> 1332.929
face a challenge of staring at a

1330.83 --> 1335.6599999999999
potential pile of money not that I have

1332.929 --> 1338.3300000000002
any right now but I need to be able to

1335.66 --> 1343.73
say it's something that I was terrible

1338.33 --> 1345.9499999999998
at saving money well when I was young it

1343.73 --> 1348.64
wasn't actually that bad because there

1345.95 --> 1351.8300000000002
was not a lot of things that I wanted

1348.64 --> 1354.169
until I figured out cannabis and then

1351.83 --> 1356.9289999999999
suddenly that started to be something

1354.169 --> 1359.3600000000001
that I wanted and then after that point

1356.929 --> 1360.5800000000002
I didn't really know how to save money

1359.36 --> 1363.5
anymore

1360.58 --> 1366.59
so yeah I can directly attribute that to

1363.5 --> 1369.799
personal addiction and I'm damn well

1366.59 --> 1375.22
ashamed of it but on the other hand it

1369.799 --> 1378.83
is I am and I have addictive tendencies

1375.22 --> 1381.169
so did my mother it's very tough to

1378.83 --> 1384.6499999999999
escape from cycles when just your you

1381.169 --> 1392.65
get stuck in it for me and for my mother

1384.65 --> 1395.3200000000002
as well so but yeah I have to face it

1392.65 --> 1397.0900000000001
and the funny thing is I have had sort

1395.32 --> 1401.8899999999999
of tests because there were days in the

1397.09 --> 1406.84
last two weeks where I yeah I didn't

1401.89 --> 1410.0700000000002
smoke or barely smoke and yeah I was

1406.84 --> 1412.6899999999998
kind of almost pissed off afterward that

1410.07 --> 1415.12
the quality of what came out of me was

1412.69 --> 1415.72
much better and I'm like oh my god

1415.12 --> 1420.61
really

1415.72 --> 1424.48
I didn't feel too great but I just did

1420.61 --> 1428.7099999999998
better that's a horrid realization of us

1424.48 --> 1435.85
it's like okay I got this choice either

1428.71 --> 1444.94
I feel kind of bliss or I face not

1435.85 --> 1446.77
feeling so bliss and just do better so

1444.94 --> 1451.5700000000002
I'm gonna try it unless time I tried

1446.77 --> 1454.03
this I was 21 and I felt really shitty

1451.57 --> 1457.6
in that time like really bad but I was

1454.03 --> 1459.37
also surrounded by bad people that were

1457.6 --> 1465.04
not good for me that were not healthy

1459.37 --> 1466.87
and yeah at home everything was wrong my

1465.04 --> 1470.3799999999999
mother and my dad it was like in the

1466.87 --> 1473.83
middle of like the pre divorce period it

1470.38 --> 1476.6200000000001
was a very shitty time but it just had

1473.83 --> 1479.02
to do it because I felt like it was

1476.62 --> 1483.4199999999998
gonna I don't know make me get an

1479.02 --> 1488.35
accident or something at the time and

1483.42 --> 1491.679
it's not like that now I I don't feel as

1488.35 --> 1497.77
bad even when I smoke I'm just noticing

1491.679 --> 1501.96
that my skill skills are less because

1497.77 --> 1505.66
when I smoke more things get worse it's

1501.96 --> 1508.03
it's annoying and I don't know if

1505.66 --> 1509.77
everybody has this effect but I think it

1508.03 --> 1514.84
is that it's starting to work like that

1509.77 --> 1517.51
for me it's like the the relaxation and

1514.84 --> 1520.059
the comfort that it brings with it it is

1517.51 --> 1522.02
a detriment it's it's a potential

1520.059 --> 1528.83
detriment to my skills

1522.02 --> 1534.1399999999999
and my output so I'm yeah I'm gonna have

1528.83 --> 1540.4099999999999
to refigure this out and I don't know if

1534.14 --> 1543.5300000000002
I could basically turn back the well the

1540.41 --> 1545.8400000000001
smoke and become not a daily smoker

1543.53 --> 1547.85
anymore and for example do it in the

1545.84 --> 1550.1
weekend but I think it's not gonna work

1547.85 --> 1552.86
though I think because every time in the

1550.1 --> 1554.06
past when I did something like that the

1552.86 --> 1556.37
other thing that would happen is that

1554.06 --> 1559.9099999999999
when I would then smoke the impact would

1556.37 --> 1563.87
just be so enormous that it would break

1559.91 --> 1567.38
my balance again because the only way

1563.87 --> 1569.9599999999998
for me that smoking is actually kind of

1567.38 --> 1572.7800000000002
durable is if I do it on a daily basis

1569.96 --> 1574.82
because if I wait too long and then

1572.78 --> 1578.21
smoke again it just makes too much

1574.82 --> 1580.79
impact so I was young

1578.21 --> 1585.83
it also Mitch made really too much

1580.79 --> 1587.69
impact way too much even then it's the

1585.83 --> 1590.1799999999998
tobacco now it's not the tobacco the

1587.69 --> 1596.23
tobacco actually makes it less bad for

1590.18 --> 1596.23
me it actually stabilizes some of it

1604.37 --> 1607.2099999999998
anyway

1609.0 --> 1615.15
yeah it's a weird balancing act and I

1612.02 --> 1624.539
feel that I just I don't want to do it

1615.15 --> 1627.6200000000001
anymore tobacco has been sprayed what

1624.539 --> 1627.62
are you talking about

1639.19 --> 1646.8400000000001
right clear well that's that's great the

1644.65 --> 1650.74
issue with me too is that I smoke

1646.84 --> 1653.5
because of the room in within the time

1650.74 --> 1657.01
and every day that I have so I have the

1653.5 --> 1659.68
room to do it and yeah then you get this

1657.01 --> 1661.3
weird paradoxical effect it's like okay

1659.68 --> 1664.78
because you have to ruin to do it you

1661.3 --> 1666.79
smoke and if you don't then you

1664.78 --> 1667.8899999999999
certainly have too much time on your

1666.79 --> 1670.99
hands

1667.89 --> 1673.5300000000002
that yeah you can't properly fill

1670.99 --> 1685.14
because you didn't plan anything

1673.53 --> 1689.1499999999999
anything bigger right so

1685.14 --> 1691.95
right there's things I want to do and

1689.15 --> 1697.92
yeah I just want to do them I don't want

1691.95 --> 1700.38
to go through this spring just hanging

1697.92 --> 1702.6200000000001
around and pretty much not doing

1700.38 --> 1702.6200000000001
anything

1707.98 --> 1712.559
what are you talking about Jeffry bill

1736.419 --> 1750.49
aluminum and barium reacts oh okay

1742.91 --> 1755.539
I don't know I don't think it's that I

1750.49 --> 1758.53
don't think so I think I'm just very

1755.539 --> 1758.53
sensitive to it

1761.61 --> 1765.61
[Music]

1772.88 --> 1779.409
[Music]

1775.71 --> 1781.6000000000001
yeah no straightforward very dumb

1779.409 --> 1784.179
questions by people that obviously know

1781.6 --> 1785.4599999999998
the answer to it will be timed out very

1784.179 --> 1788.26
simple

1785.46 --> 1790.57
they'll tolerate no [ __ ] from anyone

1788.26 --> 1792.72
don't ask questions you know the answer

1790.57 --> 1792.72
do

1821.299 --> 1829.95
MJ contain heavy metals yeah of course

1827.129 --> 1833.4289999999999
it all matters on what its gonna be

1829.95 --> 1835.969
grown-up I'm pretty satisfied that the

1833.429 --> 1841.0800000000002
quality of the cannabis here is good and

1835.969 --> 1843.779
I think that while the people that went

1841.08 --> 1845.879
with me that that I joined in the

1843.779 --> 1849.96
Amsterdam conference last year can atone

1845.879 --> 1853.859
to that it's good quality it's very

1849.96 --> 1856.7
clean and there's like laboratories here

1853.859 --> 1859.32
where you can send cannabis to test on

1856.7 --> 1863.159
how clean it is and the strength of it

1859.32 --> 1868.4399999999998
and all that and that is being done so I

1863.159 --> 1870.5700000000002
don't think quality here is that Yeah

1868.44 --> 1872.1290000000001
right yeah kind of is from you track is

1870.57 --> 1874.739
better than Amsterdam but that's because

1872.129 --> 1878.4289999999999
Amsterdam is like a tourist trap so they

1874.739 --> 1882.089
did typically do that they just try to

1878.429 --> 1886.169
maximize profit in your tract it's it's

1882.089 --> 1889.58
not so much like that it's more a big

1886.169 --> 1892.5800000000002
residential city and the quality is good

1889.58 --> 1892.58
overall

1900.02 --> 1905.03
test it myself well that's interesting

1902.75 --> 1908.75
if I knew how I could do that

1905.03 --> 1911.87
Oh platter

1908.75 --> 1914.6
yeah not America as a nightmare he's in

1911.87 --> 1918.02
trouble there's a lot of very bad stuff

1914.6 --> 1921.1299999999999
going down there I talked with my friend

1918.02 --> 1927.11
again over phone who lives there and

1921.13 --> 1929.45
yeah she's just noticing that like

1927.11 --> 1932.27
there's the corona nonsense there is

1929.45 --> 1935.3
going but it like it's people are

1932.27 --> 1937.73
responding in a bad way over there

1935.3 --> 1942.23
because it is kind of like a liberal

1937.73 --> 1945.94
City very much and they're going crazy

1942.23 --> 1945.94
over it over there so I hear

1950.58 --> 1956.6999999999998
really Jeffrey you get you you can just

1954.03 --> 1959.43
by testing kits for cannabis I didn't

1956.7 --> 1963.65
know that does it test anything other

1959.43 --> 1963.65
than just the THC levels and all that

1967.73 --> 1976.28
good to have my insiders alright well I

1971.25 --> 1981.87
just have literally a handful of friends

1976.28 --> 1984.87
so but yeah as I said before the the

1981.87 --> 1991.7099999999998
very few friends that I have I do listen

1984.87 --> 1995.07
and ask a lot and yet this lady is a

1991.71 --> 1996.17
very talkative lady that doesn't have a

1995.07 --> 2000.95
lot of friends that are very

1996.17 --> 2003.38
understanding and so yeah I'm there for

2000.95 --> 2008.93
that and she has a lot of things she

2003.38 --> 2011.18
pays attention to so she always yeah it

2008.93 --> 2015.44
could be hours on the phone listening to

2011.18 --> 2017.45
a girl yeah a woman a mother but can be

2015.44 --> 2020.3600000000001
a little tiresome sometimes but she just

2017.45 --> 2022.91
she picks up on so many details and like

2020.36 --> 2025.37
especially the psychological responses

2022.91 --> 2027.65
because it's weird you know I'm used to

2025.37 --> 2032.6899999999998
dealing with trolls and gammas and

2027.65 --> 2035.8100000000002
quarters of all shapes sizes and ages in

2032.69 --> 2038.6000000000001
here over at YouTube and other places on

2035.81 --> 2040.76
the internet she isn't because she's not

2038.6 --> 2041.77
an Internet person at all she is no time

2040.76 --> 2046.37
for that [ __ ]

2041.77 --> 2049.28
but despite that for some reason her

2046.37 --> 2052.4
social life is riddled with like the

2049.28 --> 2057.53
worst gama's imaginable and borderline

2052.4 --> 2059.929
Psychopaths even that's like yeah so she

2057.53 --> 2062.9900000000002
has around psychological warfare

2059.929 --> 2065.78
experiences and it's is uncanny when we

2062.99 --> 2068.3599999999997
compare these things how much they are

2065.78 --> 2070.34
alike when we talk about the double

2068.36 --> 2075.73
think about the red herrings abut she's

2070.34 --> 2078.29
starting to learn these terminologies

2075.73 --> 2079.79
because that's really what's going on

2078.29 --> 2081.98
the red herring the straw man the

2079.79 --> 2086.81
gaslighting she's literally learning

2081.98 --> 2090.919
these technical debate words because

2086.81 --> 2094.399
she's dealing with that and yeah it's

2090.919 --> 2098.0299999999997
awesome it's just

2094.399 --> 2101.8489999999997
right but at the same time she's also

2098.03 --> 2105.5400000000004
she has a lot of challenges because

2101.849 --> 2107.67
she's she's a woman and she's been kind

2105.54 --> 2110.25
of like conditioned by her mother in a

2107.67 --> 2114.48
way has advantages disadvantage to be

2110.25 --> 2117.24
very subservient to be very humble and

2114.48 --> 2119.25
always be there for other people even if

2117.24 --> 2123.089
yeah the problem is those people are

2119.25 --> 2125.369
complete idiots she's just super super

2123.089 --> 2128.099
it's like a natural-born mother to the

2125.369 --> 2129.9900000000002
world and thank God she now has a kid to

2128.099 --> 2132.06
mother because that kids much more worth

2129.99 --> 2133.56
it than people she tends to deal with

2132.06 --> 2135.54
because she's gets surrounded by

2133.56 --> 2138.21
narcissists and people that completely

2135.54 --> 2141.829
abuse that quality of her and she's been

2138.21 --> 2144.66
fighting that all her life all her life

2141.829 --> 2148.17
just as crazy a life as mine probably

2144.66 --> 2150.21
even more crazy in a way it's like she's

2148.17 --> 2153.27
dealing with domestic violence and [ __ ]

2150.21 --> 2156.45
too you know it's crazy people are

2153.27 --> 2160.56
there's some really crazy nasty people

2156.45 --> 2162.66
out there and her problem is she always

2160.56 --> 2164.369
sees the good thing in them she just

2162.66 --> 2168.21
can't help it's like a neurotic thing

2164.369 --> 2170.849
and I'm trying to get harsh and real

2168.21 --> 2173.4900000000002
with her because she knows to like it's

2170.849 --> 2176.13
getting too draining she doesn't want to

2173.49 --> 2177.8689999999997
do that anymore so in a way she's almost

2176.13 --> 2180.3
presented with a similar type of

2177.869 --> 2183.1800000000003
situation as I've arrived in it's like

2180.3 --> 2185.25
okay things could just keep on going

2183.18 --> 2187.2
exactly the way they are but it's just

2185.25 --> 2189.98
gonna make you get drained and suffer

2187.2 --> 2193.5
and not really progress too much and

2189.98 --> 2195.96
she's like done with it she's done with

2193.5 --> 2199.319
the subservience very much so towards

2195.96 --> 2201.48
government towards her social circles

2199.319 --> 2204.3
and she is really reforming and I'm very

2201.48 --> 2207.9
proud of her and I help her every step

2204.3 --> 2209.6400000000003
of the way if I need to because she's

2207.9 --> 2212.96
yeah she's up against some really

2209.64 --> 2212.96
naughty people sometimes

2217.44 --> 2220.44
yeah

2224.079 --> 2230.6400000000003
you know and then the next challenge is

2226.9 --> 2233.739
gonna arrive for her because when she

2230.64 --> 2235.779
manages to attain that social position

2233.739 --> 2238.989
that spiritual position for herself to

2235.779 --> 2241.839
get out of the subservience then her

2238.989 --> 2244.599
daughter will grow up and when she's

2241.839 --> 2246.4
going to be a teenager oh my god it's

2244.599 --> 2250.059
gonna be the biggest challenge in her

2246.4 --> 2254.099
life because that girl is extremely

2250.059 --> 2259.3190000000004
intelligent and spiritual yet surrounded

2254.099 --> 2264.4500000000003
by mad people like her father is insane

2259.319 --> 2267.759
dangerous scary manipulative psychopath

2264.45 --> 2270.18
who could potentially do incredibly dark

2267.759 --> 2273.009
[ __ ] but nobody really knows for sure

2270.18 --> 2277.66
because he is very creepy

2273.009 --> 2281.68
and like people like poor people in the

2277.66 --> 2283.66
system protect him they protect him and

2281.68 --> 2285.759
I wonder sometimes that's because of

2283.66 --> 2288.43
blackmail or if the people in that

2285.759 --> 2293.979
system that do that are just liberally

2288.43 --> 2298.1499999999996
insane because they protect him and they

2293.979 --> 2303.1299999999997
try to they try to take seriously they

2298.15 --> 2304.719
try to take this girl's child away not

2303.13 --> 2307.289
that they're being very successful but

2304.719 --> 2310.69
she knows they are trying to push this

2307.289 --> 2314.529
together like declared unfit as a mother

2310.69 --> 2318.039
in some way to take that child and give

2314.529 --> 2323.64
it to her father that [ __ ] psychopath

2318.039 --> 2330.009
they literally want to do that it is

2323.64 --> 2333.279
satanic and it's a problem there's some

2330.009 --> 2336.64
really nasty people there you name it

2333.279 --> 2340.569
really nasty totally out of their minds

2336.64 --> 2345.3689999999997
and they protect one another it's creepy

2340.569 --> 2348.91
as [ __ ] and well my friend has also been

2345.369 --> 2351.67
pondering like maybe maybe living here

2348.91 --> 2355.66
wasn't such a great idea after all it

2351.67 --> 2357.1
seemed great but she's kind of like

2355.66 --> 2360.2799999999997
wanna go back to the

2357.1 --> 2366.97
town she grew up in where she knows much

2360.28 --> 2370.69
money many many more people and I tend

2366.97 --> 2374.6499999999996
to kind of agree with her like name a

2370.69 --> 2376.27
huh look up I'm not a specialist that I

2374.65 --> 2378.4
may have but from everything I've heard

2376.27 --> 2380.83
from there so far it's not a good place

2378.4 --> 2389.92
to be a single mother it's actually kind

2380.83 --> 2393.97
of dangerous but yeah you know I can't

2389.92 --> 2395.44
make any of those choices for but yeah

2393.97 --> 2396.1
there's some weird stuff going around

2395.44 --> 2401.56
man

2396.1 --> 2406.87
like the Netherlands is it really isn't

2401.56 --> 2409.86
as glorious and safe as everybody likes

2406.87 --> 2413.85
to think it is there's so many

2409.86 --> 2417.96
psychologically deranged in situations

2413.85 --> 2417.96
in between at all

2422.25 --> 2429.13
yeah Gideon's sake I agree

2424.6 --> 2431.44
like she needs friends that'll actually

2429.13 --> 2433.7200000000003
protect her and that that won't have to

2431.44 --> 2435.73
because a problem for her friends cuz

2433.72 --> 2438.1299999999997
they're not rich you know she's kind of

2435.73 --> 2442.0
like she's not she's she hangs around

2438.13 --> 2444.1600000000003
with people that that are squatters and

2442.0 --> 2446.95
all that so they're not rich people and

2444.16 --> 2449.47
yeah she lives way on the other side of

2446.95 --> 2451.2999999999997
the country now sort of so those friends

2449.47 --> 2453.1299999999997
are not just gonna go on the train to

2451.3 --> 2455.02
her to visit a gret but if she lived

2453.13 --> 2456.2200000000003
there again then they're gonna be around

2455.02 --> 2459.61
the corner for them so it's gonna be

2456.22 --> 2461.8599999999997
much more convenient so she's really

2459.61 --> 2464.26
thinking about moving back if that is an

2461.86 --> 2467.59
actual financial possibility at this

2464.26 --> 2471.76
time and it's gonna be a great hassle

2467.59 --> 2473.6800000000003
once again but I don't know if she's

2471.76 --> 2475.69
gonna do it she's definitely thinking

2473.68 --> 2479.04
about any way that this is go based on

2475.69 --> 2479.04
the conversation I had last week

2487.969 --> 2490.969
right

2491.52 --> 2498.49
but really can you imagine it's like

2495.49 --> 2502.77
people there in government are literally

2498.49 --> 2507.609
trying to take away a like a dedicated

2502.77 --> 2509.64
spiritual super dedicated mother that

2507.609 --> 2514.18
they're trying to take away her child

2509.64 --> 2516.0099999999998
when she's like obsessed with with

2514.18 --> 2522.48
protecting her child and taking good

2516.01 --> 2524.38
care of really yeah awesome mother

2522.48 --> 2527.65
patient as a saint

2524.38 --> 2529.48
incredible more better than my mother

2527.65 --> 2531.28
almost but yeah my mother was not in

2529.48 --> 2534.97
that position of course it wasn't single

2531.28 --> 2538.0890000000004
and all that but and they're taking

2534.97 --> 2539.7999999999997
trying just because I don't know for

2538.089 --> 2541.859
whatever reason because of their do

2539.8 --> 2546.069
because they're dilute that time to take

2541.859 --> 2551.5
her kid away to give it to a psychopath

2546.069 --> 2555.369
that's been on record kicked her full

2551.5 --> 2558.64
power in the stomach when she was still

2555.369 --> 2561.94
recovering from giving birth yeah only a

2558.64 --> 2565.17
maniacal psychopath does that she could

2561.94 --> 2565.17
have been killed from that

2567.869 --> 2572.099
and she thinks that he actually wanted

2571.259 --> 2574.89
to kill her

2572.099 --> 2585.029
actually he never even apologized to

2574.89 --> 2586.279
that the guy is a [ __ ] maniac it's

2585.029 --> 2590.99
gonna be lucky

2586.279 --> 2590.99
he's never gonna meet me face to face

2597.079 --> 2603.15
alright but but just imagine for a

2599.819 --> 2606.72
second there's a woman with it with a

2603.15 --> 2607.2000000000003
kid it was like four or five or

2606.72 --> 2612.3799999999997
something

2607.2 --> 2615.779
three I don't know little kid with a

2612.38 --> 2617.88
ex-boyfriend who's the father that after

2615.779 --> 2619.92
they're almost after the after she gave

2617.88 --> 2622.4100000000003
birth not too long after she was still

2619.92 --> 2627.599
like her womb was still recovering it

2622.41 --> 2634.41
was still wounded he on record kicked

2627.599 --> 2638.48
her full power in the stomach it's just

2634.41 --> 2641.3999999999996
known she when she might actually have I

2638.48 --> 2644.069
think she chose not to report it to the

2641.4 --> 2647.009
police but it's known the people that

2644.069 --> 2653.22
deal with her and with him know that

2647.009 --> 2658.049
this happened and yet they still tried

2653.22 --> 2664.5589999999997
to help him take her child even though

2658.049 --> 2669.89
he is a nasty psychologically deranged

2664.559 --> 2673.9990000000003
psychopath that is infamous they're

2669.89 --> 2673.999
people know he is like that

2675.05 --> 2684.2400000000002
yeah if only she had known but yeah

2680.64 --> 2684.9
that's that's her problem it's always

2684.24 --> 2687.81
been her problem

2684.9 --> 2691.11
you know and she's at least she figured

2687.81 --> 2693.15
it out with this guy so I guess this

2691.11 --> 2696.1200000000003
story would be typically down Patricia

2693.15 --> 2702.51
stairs lane because it is kind of a

2696.12 --> 2707.85
similar scenario only yeah she did get a

2702.51 --> 2709.71
child and it's not easy yeah she's not

2707.85 --> 2712.43
getting really getting rid of him like

2709.71 --> 2712.43
that easily

2717.2 --> 2722.22
right well Gideon's sick people that are

2720.42 --> 2724.5
like that that are that afraid that

2722.22 --> 2726.2099999999996
they're dead in pain that they have so

2724.5 --> 2729.059
little control over anything that they

2726.21 --> 2734.13
do that they would literally attempt to

2729.059 --> 2737.789
murder the mother of their own child

2734.13 --> 2741.9500000000003
not too long after birth if they're like

2737.789 --> 2745.7990000000004
that they should kill themselves or

2741.95 --> 2750.8089999999997
somebody should do that for him in my

2745.799 --> 2752.309
personal opinion it's like nobody wants

2750.809 --> 2757.5190000000002
you not even you

2752.309 --> 2760.1400000000003
just just be done with it be brave for

2757.519 --> 2762.68
once in your freakin life and just be

2760.14 --> 2762.68
done with it

2779.079 --> 2791.569
anyway yeah they needed to get that off

2781.579 --> 2793.96
my chest as well because yeah yep not a

2791.569 --> 2793.96
pandemic

2796.42 --> 2799.53
[Music]

2821.44 --> 2830.53
oh dear Guns of Navarone II where are

2826.51 --> 2835.2700000000004
you going buddy be careful be very very

2830.53 --> 2839.65
careful because those thoughts burden me

2835.27 --> 2842.89
as well at times but it's a trap it's

2839.65 --> 2846.4900000000002
very dangerous to think like that it's a

2842.89 --> 2849.31
mind trap don't go there they're all

2846.49 --> 2852.97
just squirting cowards it's all of love

2849.31 --> 2856.81
all these maniacs they're all it's a

2852.97 --> 2858.18
pure hollow Bluff all of it no troll in

2856.81 --> 2862.45
check

2858.18 --> 2866.1699999999996
has anything as any power the only thing

2862.45 --> 2868.39
they can do is squirt squirt all day

2866.17 --> 2871.66
long and they'll take on any Bluff any

2868.39 --> 2875.8599999999997
[ __ ] any kind of angle but they have

2871.66 --> 2878.2
nothing then they're not not even close

2875.86 --> 2880.6600000000003
to as dangerous as the guy that I just

2878.2 --> 2882.04
mentioned because most of these trolls

2880.66 --> 2883.81
they don't do anything they're just

2882.04 --> 2887.17
sitting all day squirting behind their

2883.81 --> 2889.9
computer in their basement and yeah

2887.17 --> 2892.69
ordering their Corona mask and all that

2889.9 --> 2894.9700000000003
[ __ ] they're just squirting all day

2892.69 --> 2898.03
they don't they're not a threat

2894.97 --> 2904.29
they're just a bunch of squid a bunch of

2898.03 --> 2904.2900000000004
squirters squirting digital ink all day

2904.44 --> 2911.11
but they're not a threat not really

2906.82 --> 2914.0800000000004
they're just a nuisance really the more

2911.11 --> 2916.84
dangerous are the people that do that

2914.08 --> 2920.11
kind of [ __ ] to that nasty level in

2916.84 --> 2922.4500000000003
person face to face and if you're if

2920.11 --> 2925.09
you're really in a bad situation they'll

2922.45 --> 2929.64
get physical with it as well those are

2925.09 --> 2934.2400000000002
their really [ __ ] people but that's

2929.64 --> 2940.54
those are not the trolls the trolls are

2934.24 --> 2944.7099999999996
just a bunch of scorners you can't have

2940.54 --> 2949.99
momentum yo no this is bad this guy why

2944.71 --> 2953.5
why people like him find something is

2949.99 --> 2955.62
bad about when you got a job you don't

2953.5 --> 2960.64
making it my

2955.62 --> 2965.68
your karate denier yeah squirting

2960.64 --> 2973.92
squirting all day long veterans you

2965.68 --> 2973.9199999999996
don't believe in science science yeah

2974.7 --> 2981.43
yeah that's the trolls but they're just

2978.28 --> 2984.9100000000003
like a bunch of squids you know a squid

2981.43 --> 2987.25
is not very dangerous squid only really

2984.91 --> 2990.0699999999997
gets dangerous when you just let it

2987.25 --> 2993.31
latch itself around your throat and then

2990.07 --> 2995.23
it starts crushing you but if you slap

2993.31 --> 2997.72
it off before it gets there it's not

2995.23 --> 3001.35
that damage done it's only when you just

2997.72 --> 3003.87
sit by and let them do it all and you

3001.35 --> 3008.19
take it you take their [ __ ] and let

3003.87 --> 3012.0299999999997
them penetrate your being just a bunch

3008.19 --> 3017.1
of squids or squirters you know squids

3012.03 --> 3020.19
squirt to they squirt ink so yeah the

3017.1 --> 3023.67
squids the squirters in chat the

3020.19 --> 3027.6
controls they squirt digital ink like

3023.67 --> 3030.84
squids try to get their suction

3027.6 --> 3033.42
tentacles on anything they can just to

3030.84 --> 3036.96
try to stick in some way and latch on

3033.42 --> 3038.96
drag drag behind it try to take away the

3036.96 --> 3042.86
speed try to take away the flexibility

3038.96 --> 3042.86
squids squirters

3043.06 --> 3046.23
[Music]

3053.36 --> 3059.58
that makes sense you know there's a lot

3055.95 --> 3063.0899999999997
of squids that are into the tentacle

3059.58 --> 3065.25
porn as well why is that could it be

3063.09 --> 3069.38
because there are little squiddy's

3065.25 --> 3069.38
inside the squid has gotten

3089.91 --> 3098.83
squidward yeah well isn't he kind of

3096.52 --> 3099.79
like a troll as well he is kind of a

3098.83 --> 3102.5099999999998
squid is neat

3099.79 --> 3106.48
he's a total gamma and he is little

3102.51 --> 3108.94
bastard he is a squid they got it right

3106.48 --> 3112.89
they got Squidward right Squidward is

3108.94 --> 3112.89
like the ultimate gamma neighbor

3138.66 --> 3146.46
squidward plays the clarinet yeah I

3141.91 --> 3146.46
don't see any relevance to that but

3154.31 --> 3156.94
yep

3167.21 --> 3176.59
that's live maybe a little bit too

3170.27 --> 3176.59
descriptive there Jeffery bill but yeah

3180.43 --> 3184.4199999999996
yeah well let's not talk about sports

3183.02 --> 3188.86
Kwanzaa

3184.42 --> 3188.86
that's a bit ridiculous

3195.35 --> 3202.72
it's quittin wanna remind you of

3197.42 --> 3202.7200000000003
quagmire how they're nothing alike

3209.04 --> 3215.82
now quagmire is just a a grab ler having

3213.06 --> 3219.869
a great time for his doing but he has a

3215.82 --> 3223.38
grappler Squidward is just is just a

3219.869 --> 3225.6000000000004
gamma he's not in the know of anything

3223.38 --> 3227.28
he's not connected he doesn't know what

3225.6 --> 3229.17
the hell's going on he doesn't even know

3227.28 --> 3232.76
how to socialize properly everybody

3229.17 --> 3232.76
hates him they're nothing alike

3238.25 --> 3241.329
[Music]

3244.91 --> 3249.75
come on guys

3246.45 --> 3252.95
quagmire is a freakin grab there you got

3249.75 --> 3252.95
to know that right

3279.53 --> 3288.71
I don't know where you're getting that

3281.69 --> 3294.9500000000003
plot either but the breaking into a

3288.71 --> 3299.08
revolution really its operation and

3294.95 --> 3299.08
walking bread which one is that

3306.3 --> 3316.29
all right I think operation Mockingbird

3309.78 --> 3317.9100000000003
is yeah that's engaged so long ago I

3316.29 --> 3320.43
think that everything that that

3317.91 --> 3323.8799999999997
operation was about has already been

3320.43 --> 3325.02
pretty much fulfilled and integrated you

3323.88 --> 3328.38
can't really stop it

3325.02 --> 3329.07
it's already in everything it's already

3328.38 --> 3331.76
planted

3329.07 --> 3335.84
that's what information placement is

3331.76 --> 3335.84
that's what that was

3339.26 --> 3342.9900000000002
Mockingbird video okay that's an

3341.52 --> 3346.32
interesting way to put it

3342.99 --> 3350.9399999999996
Mockingbird Media maybe I don't know is

3346.32 --> 3354.03
it is CNN and all that is that operation

3350.94 --> 3356.18
Mockingbird I don't know I think

3354.03 --> 3359.96
operation Mockingbird was a much more

3356.18 --> 3363.0899999999997
covert information placement based thing

3359.96 --> 3365.91
CNN and all that the fake news now it's

3363.09 --> 3368.31
much more overt it's that you can't call

3365.91 --> 3372.06
that the same it's not the same

3368.31 --> 3374.0099999999998
operation unless it's like a final stage

3372.06 --> 3376.0499999999997
of the Opera to be fair I have never

3374.01 --> 3378.2700000000004
really read through operation

3376.05 --> 3381.03
Mockingbird or anything what exactly the

3378.27 --> 3384.6
details were if that's even publicized I

3381.03 --> 3388.2900000000004
think nobody I think they kept it all

3384.6 --> 3391.5299999999997
classified anyway still right or has it

3388.29 --> 3394.56
been Declassified now I don't know it's

3391.53 --> 3397.01
been a while but I don't think that the

3394.56 --> 3400.32
current situation with media is

3397.01 --> 3404.8500000000004
operation Mockingbird if anything then

3400.32 --> 3408.15
operation Mockingbird might have been

3404.85 --> 3413.1
like being reformed transformed and

3408.15 --> 3415.44
could be the reason how so many similar

3413.1 --> 3418.83
narratives are introduced

3415.44 --> 3422.93
even through the sub mainstream that

3418.83 --> 3426.6
could potentially be like a line in from

3422.93 --> 3428.6099999999997
CIA think tank type things now that

3426.6 --> 3431.43
could be somewhat considered as

3428.61 --> 3433.92
operation Mockingbird but is it is it

3431.43 --> 3436.6699999999996
that I don't know I don't think it's the

3433.92 --> 3436.67
same project

3445.48 --> 3455.809
all right just be aware that a lot of

3453.46 --> 3462.069
people go around on the Internet

3455.809 --> 3462.0690000000004
including flat-earthers and all that no

3462.579 --> 3475.3390000000004
it's okay thanks for that good servant

3468.16 --> 3476.8289999999997
it's just weird how you got me

3475.339 --> 3480.7
distracted

3476.829 --> 3480.7000000000003
what was it talking about

3484.45 --> 3491.71
all right flat earthers yeah we have to

3488.17 --> 3495.4300000000003
be we have to become more aware of where

3491.71 --> 3497.17
we're getting our information fed from

3495.43 --> 3499.3799999999997
now the funny thing is in a way it's

3497.17 --> 3501.76
kind of ironic is that nathan is

3499.38 --> 3503.7400000000002
probably one of the people out there

3501.76 --> 3508.75
that is more on top of it than most

3503.74 --> 3511.93
people I know but think that he

3508.75 --> 3516.04
overlooks certain details too because

3511.93 --> 3518.47
that approach makes him like you like

3516.04 --> 3521.349
universally skeptic skeptic towards

3518.47 --> 3523.93
absolutely everything and that makes him

3521.349 --> 3525.6400000000003
overlook certain things make something

3523.93 --> 3526.8689999999997
everything is fake basically it is a

3525.64 --> 3529.41
side effect

3526.869 --> 3534.07
it's a solipsistic type of side effect

3529.41 --> 3538.99
it comes out of that so but it's good to

3534.07 --> 3542.349
be aware that a lot of things that we

3538.99 --> 3547.089
keep ourselves busy with myself included

3542.349 --> 3550.9300000000003
by the way is being fed to us through

3547.089 --> 3555.21
other channels now where did they get

3550.93 --> 3557.5
that feed from did they all make it up

3555.21 --> 3559.2400000000002
doesn't seem like that because there's

3557.5 --> 3561.67
so many stories that are pretty much

3559.24 --> 3563.6189999999997
similar they're not exactly the same but

3561.67 --> 3565.63
they certainly carry the same tone the

3563.619 --> 3569.4100000000003
same direction maybe slightly different

3565.63 --> 3571.569
personal angle other insights but it

3569.41 --> 3573.8489999999997
seems like there is a direction being

3571.569 --> 3577.54
given in some way when you really

3573.849 --> 3579.9
compare a lot of things and that should

3577.54 --> 3584.44
something should be something we should

3579.9 --> 3586.569
not just ignore and realize that if

3584.44 --> 3587.53
you're gonna latch on to anything even

3586.569 --> 3589.18
if you thought it was a really

3587.53 --> 3596.829
well-written article you should realize

3589.18 --> 3599.6499999999996
that it could be part of a feed and then

3596.829 --> 3601.8390000000004
yeah anytime you get feed it's just like

3599.65 --> 3603.76
with feeding Birds if you've constantly

3601.839 --> 3606.2799999999997
feed Birds they'll start to count on it

3603.76 --> 3608.3190000000004
and then they'll stop searching their

3606.28 --> 3612.4300000000003
own food because they know that food is

3608.319 --> 3616.56
there that's the problem if you rely on

3612.43 --> 3618.339
feed because there is so much of it

3616.56 --> 3623.189
you'll stop

3618.339 --> 3626.89
digging for food in your own spirit and

3623.189 --> 3629.92
that's probably the main reason why

3626.89 --> 3633.6299999999997
people especially youtubers should not

3629.92 --> 3636.969
always be engaged with media constantly

3633.63 --> 3640.65
engaged doesn't mean that you I watch a

3636.969 --> 3643.539
lot of media if you're constantly like

3640.65 --> 3646.6600000000003
making your whole day about that and

3643.539 --> 3649.029
things that happen in that and not your

3646.66 --> 3653.109
own personal life and creativity you

3649.029 --> 3656.829
know that then eventually you lose that

3653.109 --> 3661.119
ability or it'll become less strong to

3656.829 --> 3663.369
tap into the feed of your own spirit so

3661.119 --> 3666.1890000000003
be careful with that be careful with the

3663.369 --> 3669.099
feed be careful with the media feed who

3666.189 --> 3671.3799999999997
is feeding this and are you gonna keep

3669.099 --> 3674.339
on eating you know even this is skeptic

3671.38 --> 3677.529
you know even if you say that's all fake

3674.339 --> 3683.049
well are you gonna then obsess all day

3677.529 --> 3687.579
with it being fake you see that's that's

3683.049 --> 3689.979
feed to you understand that some that's

3687.579 --> 3692.1090000000004
food given to you and you took it you

3689.979 --> 3694.749
didn't take it literally but you took it

3692.109 --> 3698.049
ah positionally that's still taking it

3694.749 --> 3700.1789999999996
you're still making it a thing that you

3698.049 --> 3704.319
concern yourself with in that moment and

3700.179 --> 3707.4390000000003
that may linger in you not giving you

3704.319 --> 3710.249
room to tap in to feed that comes

3707.439 --> 3710.249
naturally

3722.2 --> 3725.41
what's this

3735.4 --> 3747.94
you should go well look I hope I'm not

3745.539 --> 3750.67
like causing everyone that follows me to

3747.94 --> 3753.21
literally obsess over me all day that

3750.67 --> 3753.21
would be good

3758.25 --> 3764.64
so yeah and that I know I get feed out

3761.31 --> 3770.58
every day I give my guy I bring the feed

3764.64 --> 3776.91
I bring the food but don't make

3770.58 --> 3781.369
everything then only about me I don't

3776.91 --> 3781.3689999999997
want people getting obsessed like that I

3783.83 --> 3788.97
prefer to be your friend

3786.06 --> 3795.18
maybe teacher if you're willing to let

3788.97 --> 3798.81
me be that to you and also an

3795.18 --> 3801.98
entertainer in a way has to be there and

3798.81 --> 3805.609
that that should be it

3801.98 --> 3808.83
and I hope that's that's gonna be enough

3805.609 --> 3810.5989999999997
motivation for you to to help me out

3808.83 --> 3812.46
financially as well to support me

3810.599 --> 3815.9700000000003
through the PayPal patreon my GoFundMe

3812.46 --> 3820.83
and the super chat because I do need it

3815.97 --> 3826.0499999999997
and hopefully if my personal challenge

3820.83 --> 3828.69
will go as I hope it will then I might

3826.05 --> 3832.65
even need less to get around and they

3828.69 --> 3836.66
could just use surpluses or maybe get

3832.65 --> 3841.589
that the fresh air system for once right

3836.66 --> 3844.5299999999997
oh and at the same time by the way I got

3841.589 --> 3846.48
from the Florida and show off fraud when

3844.53 --> 3848.01
I rather the crypto financial front in

3846.48 --> 3850.4900000000002
this case I've got some good news

3848.01 --> 3857.28
everyone

3850.49 --> 3861.1189999999997
yeah my my what is it my license as it's

3857.28 --> 3862.619
called is almost full it's gonna be for

3861.119 --> 3865.38
this summer and that means I'm gonna

3862.619 --> 3868.32
have full output and things to do with

3865.38 --> 3873.06
it and I I will have cryptocurrency that

3868.32 --> 3878.119
I can trade it's not like Bitcoin it's

3873.06 --> 3881.58
not a lot but it is a constant product

3878.119 --> 3884.13
virtual and I am gonna what I'm gonna

3881.58 --> 3887.339
test it out with my dad soon I'm gonna

3884.13 --> 3890.4300000000003
see if for example I can trade some of

3887.339 --> 3895.93
that cryptocurrency that come

3890.43 --> 3898.39
in two lemons from D life because that

3895.93 --> 3902.19
should be possible to do that and then

3898.39 --> 3905.41
certainly I'm gonna have some virtual

3902.19 --> 3908.29
maneuvering room financially to do some

3905.41 --> 3910.39
things with it without even taxes being

3908.29 --> 3913.75
involved at all it's like it never has

3910.39 --> 3916.6299999999997
to even be money but I'll have some

3913.75 --> 3918.79
crypto maneuvering room that might be

3916.63 --> 3920.8
interesting because there is more social

3918.79 --> 3926.08
media that seems to be dealing with this

3920.8 --> 3929.94
so I might actually yeah get something

3926.08 --> 3932.14
with it without having to transform

3929.94 --> 3935.62
physical money that I kind of need for

3932.14 --> 3938.08
food and all that into it so that's an

3935.62 --> 3942.27
interesting prospect for me in the near

3938.08 --> 3946.83
future it's just a few weeks away it's

3942.27 --> 3949.09
yeah two months two months that's it

3946.83 --> 3950.98
then I got it so it's going to be

3949.09 --> 3954.7000000000003
midsummer and I will be having a full

3950.98 --> 3958.57
license GTI anyway oh thank you by the

3954.7 --> 3961.2999999999997

you're literally helping me survive here

4079.869 --> 4084.969
thank you a lot I in the middle of the

4083.529 --> 4088.619
morning I always needed more than any

4084.969 --> 4092.259
other time pretty much after like the

4088.619 --> 4096.339
in-between the 19th and the 18th it's

4092.259 --> 4101.049
the toughest time but it might get

4096.339 --> 4105.4
better you know as I am gonna try to

4101.049 --> 4111.339
wean off the cannabis because there is a

4105.4 --> 4114.369
big cost post unfortunately then we

4111.339 --> 4117.04
thank you so much both brendham and of

4114.369 --> 4124.0199999999995

donations thank you so much okay

4124.079 --> 4137.5599999999995
hour and eight minutes nice okay well

4127.0 --> 4144.549
hits Sundays I keep it going it's also

4137.56 --> 4146.56
interesting because I've as I going back

4144.549 --> 4151.9
to my personal realization yesterday

4146.56 --> 4155.889
evening I also realized a how do you

4151.9 --> 4158.969
call that a system a psychological

4155.889 --> 4162.52
mechanism an automated mechanism that my

4158.969 --> 4166.96
consciousness specifically performs in

4162.52 --> 4169.309
the moment I kind of realized a very

4166.96 --> 4171.859
basic escapism mechanism

4169.309 --> 4176.359
that kind of diffuses tension on the

4171.859 --> 4180.799
short run but I also noticed that's

4176.359 --> 4183.049
actually kind of detrimental to my

4180.799 --> 4185.319
compacted 'no sit diffuses me when I do

4183.049 --> 4188.359
that and then when I realized that I

4185.319 --> 4192.139
focused on it in a moment and what it

4188.359 --> 4195.289000000001
basically makes me do is let my

4192.139 --> 4200.2390000000005
consciousness not drift to the side but

4195.289 --> 4202.55
like really keep it like that and it can

4200.239 --> 4204.53
no there's no other way to explain it I

4202.55 --> 4207.17
keep it like that keep it under

4204.53 --> 4210.199
attention not too much attention and

4207.17 --> 4214.28
when I do that things start to happen

4210.199 --> 4217.428999999999
it's weird like suddenly my guts start

4214.28 --> 4221.03
to bubble it's like all this stuff

4217.429 --> 4223.789
starts to happen and it's a trick it's a

4221.03 --> 4227.2699999999995
basic trick and all I need to do is just

4223.789 --> 4231.5
not let myself go into automated

4227.27 --> 4233.9890000000005
distracted mode where I let my spirit

4231.5 --> 4237.17
wander off no I forced my spirit almost

4233.989 --> 4241.129999999999
like in a cage in myself I compact it

4237.17 --> 4246.02
and force it to be here forced me to be

4241.13 --> 4250.309
here with my conscious focus for cos

4246.02 --> 4252.88
here not out there not the world and

4250.309 --> 4260.1990000000005
what other crazy people are doing just

4252.88 --> 4265.539
be here and it's almost like is that

4260.199 --> 4268.28
what meditation is supposed to do cuz I

4265.539 --> 4275.809
never really made much sense to me but I

4268.28 --> 4279.34
think a perception a perception I I

4275.809 --> 4282.76
don't understand that word

4279.34 --> 4286.72
but yeah I did that and since I've done

4282.76 --> 4287.68
it I forgot a lot more concentration

4286.72 --> 4290.4400000000005
available

4287.68 --> 4292.59
it's like visceral I can feel it that

4290.44 --> 4296.41
give I can notice it even in a moment

4292.59 --> 4299.08
I'm more fluid I make less mistakes

4296.41 --> 4303.91
I don't stumble all of a sudden as much

4299.08 --> 4308.8
I don't have confidence Falls like

4303.91 --> 4315.7
suddenly oh [ __ ] I'm it's going to go

4308.8 --> 4318.37
back that it's gone so this is part this

4315.7 --> 4321.849999999999
technique very basic technique it's like

4318.37 --> 4324.099999999999
why haven't I trained that my entire

4321.85 --> 4327.13
freakin now I know why because then I

4324.1 --> 4329.35
wouldn't be such a dreamer but I think

4327.13 --> 4333.61
this may be the most basic trick that I

4329.35 --> 4337.06
originally kind of did by accident to go

4333.61 --> 4339.4
into squirt mode because it's like a

4337.06 --> 4345.81
natural thing I can do it's like just

4339.4 --> 4349.33
force myself in distraction and it's

4345.81 --> 4352.06
grown as a mechanism in there it's

4349.33 --> 4354.07
without me even consciously realizing it

4352.06 --> 4358.3
too much it's so odd how that works but

4354.07 --> 4360.549999999999
I am conscious now and I am going to do

4358.3 --> 4363.400000000001
this like this in a different way

4360.55 --> 4365.29
because in earlier periods when I got

4363.4 --> 4367.36
really frustrated with myself in a

4365.29 --> 4370.2699999999995
situation for example I would have these

4367.36 --> 4373.929999999999
moments to I would attempt to do this

4370.27 --> 4375.610000000001
right this effect but because in that

4373.93 --> 4380.9400000000005
moment in that realization I would be

4375.61 --> 4385.29
angry it wouldn't stay you know why I

4380.94 --> 4390.389999999999
figured it out I finally figured out why

4385.29 --> 4395.59
because the anger in that moment is not

4390.39 --> 4397.570000000001
because I want to be whole yeah it's not

4395.59 --> 4400.360000000001
because of I want this because that

4397.57 --> 4404.38
would work no it's because I wanted to

4400.36 --> 4409.78
be able to go back to sleep and enjoy it

4404.38 --> 4412.27
and that's why that never worked it's a

4409.78 --> 4414.99
pretty incredible realization

4412.27 --> 4418.39
it's really about the conscious decision

4414.99 --> 4420.58
making and your position and it's such a

4418.39 --> 4422.200000000001
big decision that there's all these

4420.58 --> 4424.24
other processes of what your

4422.2 --> 4427.33
consciousness does with the aftermath

4424.24 --> 4430.0599999999995
and after result but now I figured out

4427.33 --> 4435.88
that is why that didn't work because I

4430.06 --> 4443.620000000001
didn't want it that's why and that's the

4435.88 --> 4446.67
big difference and it's now working it's

4443.62 --> 4446.67
finally working

4451.42 --> 4456.47
all right yeah guns of our MP of

4455.03 --> 4459.55
Navarone our MP if you want to be

4456.47 --> 4459.55
patreon that would be awesome

4459.79 --> 4465.98
like I really appreciate patreon because

4462.59 --> 4468.02
again it's such a it's just this out

4465.98 --> 4470.209999999999
look like on at least that's always

4468.02 --> 4473.72
gonna come you know it's it's a great

4470.21 --> 4475.7300000000005
relief you don't have to be like hoping

4473.72 --> 4478.31
that somebody just drops money on you

4475.73 --> 4481.219999999999
all the time although that's always nice

4478.31 --> 4483.71
when that happens what patreon is it's

4481.22 --> 4488.51
nice because it's just is this thing

4483.71 --> 4490.97
that's always there if if you can if you

4488.51 --> 4493.7300000000005
have patreon capabilities you know

4490.97 --> 4498.37
appreciate it and I want to send more

4493.73 --> 4498.37
really Wow okay that's awesome

4499.7 --> 4506.57
okay well the best way would be patriot

4502.55 --> 4508.25
we'll be paypal it probably worked in

4506.57 --> 4510.679999999999
most direct way so if you want to do

4508.25 --> 4514.04
that then yeah those the links for it

4510.68 --> 4516.320000000001
are in the description box below Guns of

4514.04 --> 4518.51
Navarone our MP thank you so much for

4516.32 --> 4521.5
yeah your will your will to support I

4518.51 --> 4521.5
really appreciate that

4524.38 --> 4534.74
anyway compactness the focus and yeah on

4530.9 --> 4537.5599999999995
top of that effect right so what can

4534.74 --> 4541.099999999999
cannabis especially like when you get a

4537.56 --> 4544.55
big joint or when it's late and I've

4541.1 --> 4547.22
already had a few this doesn't work

4544.55 --> 4552.38
either because that is also a thing that

4547.22 --> 4555.740000000001
cannabis does eventually first when you

4552.38 --> 4558.89
get hit a head first time then you can't

4555.74 --> 4561.11
really do that for a moment just take

4558.89 --> 4563.12
long and then later in the evening when

4561.11 --> 4567.95
I have smoked a lot you can't really do

4563.12 --> 4574.849999999999
that either so it's see all these

4567.95 --> 4577.55
mechanisms cannabis income the spiritual

4574.85 --> 4578.990000000001
tricks my ascension me getting more

4577.55 --> 4582.17
serious all these things are also

4578.99 --> 4582.83
directly interconnected if you ignore

4582.17 --> 4586.16
what

4582.83 --> 4595.43
part the arrest is gonna falter so I

4586.16 --> 4599.71
have to focus now and and keep it keep

4595.43 --> 4604.070000000001
it conscious on this keep it compacted

4599.71 --> 4606.8
it's gonna be tough and I'm probably

4604.07 --> 4609.11
gonna buckle and I'm when it happens I'm

4606.8 --> 4611.87
probably gonna be incredibly miserable

4609.11 --> 4613.969999999999
and crying like a little [ __ ] and then

4611.87 --> 4619.96
slapping myself in the face and trying

4613.97 --> 4623.27
again I hope it doesn't happen too much

4619.96 --> 4626.99
because at the same time when I compact

4623.27 --> 4631.370000000001
there is like a lot of old hurt it's

4626.99 --> 4633.83
like but it's like this inside but but

4631.37 --> 4639.32
but but but all these subtle feelings

4633.83 --> 4644.0599999999995
and you heard it so much so long it

4639.32 --> 4647.48
tries to force its way back out because

4644.06 --> 4651.29
it's used to be out to not be in there

4647.48 --> 4656.66
to be free to basically roam around my

4651.29 --> 4659.33
energy and then I have to prevent it

4656.66 --> 4661.28
from tricking me into letting it go

4659.33 --> 4665.15
again because it's almost like a

4661.28 --> 4667.179999999999
separate entity sometimes sometimes you

4665.15 --> 4671.42
really feel like that is not really me

4667.18 --> 4676.18
it's parts that I've gotten used to

4671.42 --> 4681.05
associate with me but is it really me

4676.18 --> 4684.02
maybe it was but I'm starting to

4681.05 --> 4687.83
disassociate with those aspects of

4684.02 --> 4690.64
myself I don't really want them to be a

4687.83 --> 4690.64
part of me anymore

4691.739 --> 4697.889999999999
oh oh and by the way I had a very vivid

4695.76 --> 4699.3
dream yesterday as well which I'm not

4697.89 --> 4701.88
going to talk about because it was

4699.3 --> 4709.110000000001
actually kind of humiliating and that is

4701.88 --> 4712.4400000000005
extremely interesting that it was it was

4709.11 --> 4717.03
a humiliation dream and it was almost

4712.44 --> 4720.12
like they were testing me to see if I

4717.03 --> 4724.08
would respond to humiliation or if I

4720.12 --> 4725.58
would be like no I am in control and

4724.08 --> 4731.5199999999995
guess what I was definitely in control

4725.58 --> 4736.11
that time it's a parasite maybe getting

4731.52 --> 4740.4890000000005
sick I don't know maybe it is maybe it

4736.11 --> 4742.7699999999995
is just appetites maybe it's just gravel

4740.489 --> 4744.75
traits you know a parent I don't

4742.77 --> 4747.9800000000005
necessarily want to see it as an

4744.75 --> 4751.5
external force that is trying to take me

4747.98 --> 4753.089999999999
because that is that's just that sound

4751.5 --> 4754.56
doesn't that sound familiar you know

4753.09 --> 4756.92
that's kind of the same thing that's

4754.56 --> 4760.38
been done with viruses so like this

4756.92 --> 4762.09
hostile entity it'll penetrate you and

4760.38 --> 4765.2390000000005
then take you over oh really

4762.09 --> 4767.55
is it though or is it just a natural

4765.239 --> 4771.209999999999
mechanism well I think that these

4767.55 --> 4775.05
elements that I've associated myself

4771.21 --> 4776.85
with are also natural elements that just

4775.05 --> 4779.85
they're they're available and they have

4776.85 --> 4782.25
their consequences I don't even know if

4779.85 --> 4786.21
they are necessarily like a hostile

4782.25 --> 4790.19
thing it's more like a habit and habit

4786.21 --> 4793.71
does not care whether it is functional

4790.19 --> 4797.73
rational or even makes you feel good no

4793.71 --> 4801.51
it just wants to persist because that is

4797.73 --> 4804.03
how it works is that a hostile entity

4801.51 --> 4806.31
taking you and then trying to get in

4804.03 --> 4808.2
your way or is it just a natural

4806.31 --> 4811.9400000000005
mechanism that is part of psyche of your

4808.2 --> 4811.94
psyche see

4818.32 --> 4827.29
I'm serious guys and it's also it

4822.44 --> 4831.83
borders to the idea that everybody has

4827.29 --> 4834.2
God and the devil in them the shoulder I

4831.83 --> 4838.34
dare they everybody has that as part of

4834.2 --> 4841.429999999999
them but is that really in an other

4838.34 --> 4848.12
entity or is it simply a part of our

4841.43 --> 4849.77
bill than our experience and type a

4848.12 --> 4851.8099999999995
railroad traps

4849.77 --> 4856.660000000001
that'll naturally arrive like

4851.81 --> 4860.96
aberrations when you when you tap out

4856.66 --> 4864.47
when you go away from logos yeah that

4860.96 --> 4866.77
could be called satanic because doing it

4864.47 --> 4872.45
wrong that's what that is

4866.77 --> 4876.950000000001
but does that make the person not them

4872.45 --> 4879.17
or are just mechanisms that have kind of

4876.95 --> 4882.74
gotten you have been given their own

4879.17 --> 4883.67
life and kind of taken over the

4882.74 --> 4885.59
consciousness

4883.67 --> 4888.55
it's like those processes have become

4885.59 --> 4890.87
prioritized over logical decision-making

4888.55 --> 4894.4400000000005
does that make them possessed by Devils

4890.87 --> 4897.41
or does it make them possessed by a

4894.44 --> 4901.009999999999
natural separated psychological elements

4897.41 --> 4905.2699999999995
that have kind of taken over that if

4901.01 --> 4910.04
yeah in it's still the person in a way

4905.27 --> 4915.38
it's just not a natural manifestation of

4910.04 --> 4918.22
how normal human beings are and in that

4915.38 --> 4924.68
sense I've argued a long time ago even

4918.22 --> 4930.35
that true evil is just madness it's just

4924.68 --> 4932.83
madness very bizarre extreme perform of

4930.35 --> 4932.83
madness

4933.889 --> 4940.4800000000005
yeah well not parasitic again see it's

4937.219 --> 4944.96
like you're all so desperate that take

4940.48 --> 4948.138999999999
this evil thing and dissociate it from

4944.96 --> 4953.27
you it's like no it's a hostile thing

4948.139 --> 4957.26
from the outside trying to get me is it

4953.27 --> 4960.7390000000005
or is it just a natural piece of you

4957.26 --> 4964.96
that you have to learn to deal with as

4960.739 --> 4964.959999999999
part of the challenge of creation

4973.4 --> 4976.4
see

4986.699 --> 4996.0
right well is it hostile or is the

4992.52 --> 5000.5
person hostile for not wanting to let

4996.0 --> 5003.8
sink things sink in and give the rains

5000.5 --> 5006.699
to be arranged elements of themselves to

5003.8 --> 5006.6990000000005
protect themselves

5026.19 --> 5036.179999999999
so it is hostile or are you is the

5030.96 --> 5039.78
person hostile you know it is hostile

5036.18 --> 5043.9800000000005
it's a matter of perspective it can

5039.78 --> 5046.139999999999
trick you or do you trick you does the

5043.98 --> 5049.04
person trick themselves and these

5046.14 --> 5052.04
elements are just forwarded as a

5049.04 --> 5052.04
solution

5061.909 --> 5080.69
that's dicey yes it is what are you

5079.88 --> 5084.56
talking about

5080.69 --> 5087.08
narc slacker I get what you're saying

5084.56 --> 5088.31
okay good and good servant I understand

5087.08 --> 5093.469
what you're saying as well it's just

5088.31 --> 5098.84
that when you try to separate the evil

5093.469 --> 5102.4
from yourself it is effectively moving

5098.84 --> 5107.32
the perspective on yourself from a

5102.4 --> 5110.9
responsibility point of view into a

5107.32 --> 5111.86
hostility point of view see it's a

5110.9 --> 5114.129999999999
matter of perspective

5111.86 --> 5114.13
edit

5116.15 --> 5122.62
[Music]

5118.08 --> 5125.41
because separating it from you is a form

5122.62 --> 5127.69
of polarization and it falls down the

5125.41 --> 5128.83
line of politicization when you separate

5127.69 --> 5132.849999999999
things from yourself

5128.83 --> 5138.25
that are a part of yourself actually in

5132.85 --> 5140.46
a way then yeah you don't give

5138.25 --> 5143.44
recognition to the full scope of

5140.46 --> 5145.9
creation of what you are in a way and

5143.44 --> 5147.969999999999
that doesn't mean that the dark parts

5145.9 --> 5150.94
that the bad parts in the escapism in

5147.97 --> 5154.21
the the weakness should be encouraged or

5150.94 --> 5158.73
emphasized right absolutely not no no no

5154.21 --> 5162.7300000000005
but it should not be separated from your

5158.73 --> 5166.03
self because then you're kind of

5162.73 --> 5168.61
attacking an aspect of yourself instead

5166.03 --> 5170.759999999999
of recognizing it and taking

5168.61 --> 5170.759999999999
responsibility

5175.739 --> 5182.678999999999
but it's not good it it those aspects

5179.77 --> 5184.659000000001
are not good aspect its side effects of

5182.679 --> 5185.5
bad situations that's right good serve

5184.659 --> 5187.929
and you are correct

5185.5 --> 5190.05
anyway I can take a break be back in two

5187.929 --> 5190.05

religion and it is written by men and

5524.32 --> 5527.48
translated that's right it doesn't

5526.969 --> 5532.55

this story is Stanley stands it doesn't

5532.55 --> 5539.659000000001
matter it doesn't matter if a freaking

5536.15 --> 5544.429
goat wrote it or an elephant it doesn't

5539.659 --> 5547.969
matter what matters is what you read and

5544.429 --> 5552.11
what it does and what it means and the

5547.969 --> 5560.12
esoteric implications doesn't matter I

5552.11 --> 5564.469
don't care who wrote it you know I don't

5560.12 --> 5567.14
care like even if it would be written by

5564.469 --> 5572.63
the most evil person that has ever lived

5567.14 --> 5574.400000000001

5572.63 --> 5579.08
screwing everyone in the ultimate

5574.4 --> 5582.589999999999
control prank that that's it wouldn't

5579.08 --> 5588.26
matter it would not matter because the

book is what it is the power is there it

5588.26 --> 5594.02
doesn't matter who wrote it and it

5592.159 --> 5595.79
doesn't matter even that much that

5594.02 --> 5599.27
things have been altered or left out

5595.79 --> 5603.949
even because the power of it stands it's

5599.27 --> 5607.429
there you can't mistake it you can't

5603.949 --> 5610.82
twist it not really if you twist it then

5607.429 --> 5613.04
you become atheist you become like that

5610.82 --> 5614.509999999999
and it's very telling the frequency

5613.04 --> 5616.909
changes of somebody that does that

5614.51 --> 5618.14
immediately so it doesn't matter who

5616.909 --> 5620.03
wrote it doesn't matter if it came

5618.14 --> 5626.0
falling out of the sky one day it

5620.03 --> 5628.82
doesn't matter the only thing that

5626.0 --> 5631.0
matters is for what it is and what it

5628.82 --> 5631.0
does

can make a a funny clip if they wanted

5678.679 --> 5688.07
off my my personals what is it my

5682.489 --> 5689.69
squirter boy act earlier I have no

5688.07 --> 5691.67
problem with that if you want if you

5689.69 --> 5695.268999999999
want my voice of like the ultimate

5691.67 --> 5697.369
squirt boy and put some animation over

5695.269 --> 5700.099
that I don't know maybe he's just only

5697.369 --> 5702.799999999999
for big bears if you want to do that

5700.099 --> 5704.979
that's fine or maybe my voice just sucks

5702.8 --> 5708.829000000001
too much and be like what's this weird

5704.979 --> 5712.01
Dutch accent in there I don't know man

5708.829 --> 5714.889
it doesn't matter I just think that the

5712.01 --> 5723.349
concept of squirters and grab lers are

5714.889 --> 5723.979
just so freakin funny to do that it's

creepy

5723.979 --> 5730.309
yes quickly you being mean to me I'm

5728.449 --> 5733.969
gonna report you and then you're gonna

5730.309 --> 5736.6900000000005
take down your channel and keep your

5733.969 --> 5736.69
social distance

5743.829 --> 5751.268999999999
yeah squirt boy squid boy squirt boy

5747.349 --> 5751.269
it's kind of the same thing to me now

5761.02 --> 5767.17
Oh God yeah talking about squirt boys

5765.2 --> 5770.36
right

5767.17 --> 5773.66
we all know a certain person that is

5770.36 --> 5778.19
that could not be defined more perfectly

5773.66 --> 5788.51
than a squirt boy you all know who it is

5778.19 --> 5795.469999999999
right it's Brenda Brenda's the ultimate

5788.51 --> 5797.51
squirt boy remember she I still

5795.47 --> 5799.9400000000005
conveniently call her if she even though

5797.51 --> 5801.4400000000005
it's a guy actually squirt boy but I'm

5799.94 --> 5804.349999999999
gonna call her ashy when I talk about

5801.44 --> 5807.139999999999
her she came in chat two days ago I'm

5804.35 --> 5808.820000000001
gonna report you a man ain't gonna

5807.14 --> 5814.150000000001
report you yeah that's because that's

5808.82 --> 5818.54
what squirt boys do exactly that only

5814.15 --> 5821.69
brenda has a more calm voice and just

5818.54 --> 5824.99
very drown --is-- she doesn't really

5821.69 --> 5830.349999999999
know how to express emotions in a normal

5824.99 --> 5834.5599999999995
way the swagman

5830.35 --> 5836.6900000000005
yee-yee so yeah she's kind of a numb

5834.56 --> 5839.93
down squirt boy I think she's probably

5836.69 --> 5844.969999999999
taking too many drugs or hormones that

5839.93 --> 5847.31
went bad or something yeah the other

5844.97 --> 5852.8
Brenda not you Brandon no no no you're

5847.31 --> 5855.950000000001
definitely not a squirt boy yeah well

5852.8 --> 5859.7
what's the full name again Brenda Phan

5855.95 --> 5862.7
hacen that's that's the one no not you

5859.7 --> 5864.849999999999
Brandon thank god you're not a squirt

5862.7 --> 5864.849999999999
boy

5867.949 --> 5873.73
it's my am that's right

5882.56 --> 5888.96
good servants why you should even be

5887.7 --> 5892.5599999999995
asking that kind of thing

5888.96 --> 5896.34
it's like why would you care why would

5892.56 --> 5899.870000000001
anybody care really what what Brenda

5896.34 --> 5899.87
looks like at this point you know

5905.47 --> 5908.569
[Music]

5914.93 --> 5921.240000000001
they're enjoying [ __ ] out of all these

5918.39 --> 5927.12
flowers going open everywhere and the

5921.24 --> 5936.65
lack of wind so yeah bees are always a

5927.12 --> 5940.53
good sign it doesn't have any parasites

5936.65 --> 5943.0199999999995
because insects especially flying

5940.53 --> 5945.86
insects sometimes do they get like

5943.02 --> 5950.43
little parasites that get in between

5945.86 --> 5953.5199999999995
their shoulders and [ __ ] usually that

5950.43 --> 5955.9800000000005
happens more later in the year but I

5953.52 --> 5956.790000000001
always check when I see bugs are like

5955.98 --> 5959.959999999999
are they healthy

5956.79 --> 5962.43
are they not riddled with parasites

5959.96 --> 5964.17
because that's very important if they're

5962.43 --> 5967.2300000000005
riddled with parasites they're yeah

5964.17 --> 5970.82
that's not gonna end well anyway I'm

5967.23 --> 5970.82
gonna help this one out

5977.98 --> 5983.199
wait

5980.04 --> 5983.199
[Music]

5992.06 --> 6016.660000000001
Oh sneaky B come on stop being so silly

6026.19 --> 6033.58
the bees are kind of looking around the

6029.05 --> 6035.650000000001
buildings here - I don't know too late

6033.58 --> 6038.26
to make nests or something I think

6035.65 --> 6046.0
they're not high fees these ones these

6038.26 --> 6053.76
are like bees they're like solitary bees

6046.0 --> 6053.76
I think anyway always good to see them

6057.63 --> 6063.52
yeah and another sign that there's

6060.969 --> 6066.52
probably not a lot of 5g activity over

6063.52 --> 6071.1
here because bees are the first thing to

6066.52 --> 6071.1
go when that happens you'll see

6088.48 --> 6099.009999999999
right yeah also by the way a general tip

6095.07 --> 6101.2
if you have sometimes insects especially

6099.01 --> 6105.25
bees I've seen this happen last year

6101.2 --> 6111.37
it's very tragic bees can also trap

6105.25 --> 6118.05
themselves accidentally in rooms if for

6111.37 --> 6121.15
example there is sunlight on one side

6118.05 --> 6122.860000000001
yet there's no windows to be open like

6121.15 --> 6124.66
if there's large windows those bees are

6122.86 --> 6126.25
going to be drawn to it and there's

6124.66 --> 6128.65
going to be no way out and then they'll

6126.25 --> 6130.75
yeah if they get in from the other side

6128.65 --> 6132.3099999999995
they'll be drawn to the light again they

6130.75 --> 6134.71
go to the window and then they'll

6132.31 --> 6138.46
eventually just exhaust themselves and

6134.71 --> 6141.28
die last year there were like 50 dead

6138.46 --> 6144.07
bees inside because they all got trapped

6141.28 --> 6147.58
so if if you're noticing this kind of

6144.07 --> 6152.0199999999995
thing make sure that when it's hot you

6147.58 --> 6156.64
put a window on the side of where the

6152.02 --> 6160.06
Sun is hitting it on that side you put a

6156.64 --> 6161.92
window open because then insects will be

6160.06 --> 6165.04
drawn to the light and then they might

6161.92 --> 6168.1900000000005
escape after all they won't typically

6165.04 --> 6170.08
come in through a hot side though you

6168.19 --> 6173.98
know because from the outside bees won't

6170.08 --> 6178.09
look up hot surfaces like that when it's

6173.98 --> 6180.669999999999
hot so think about it if you got a house

6178.09 --> 6183.31
or a room or whatever with windows and

6180.67 --> 6185.65
their Sun on it and typically insects

6183.31 --> 6187.780000000001
get stuck inside make sure you open a

6185.65 --> 6189.339999999999
window because then they can get out you

6187.78 --> 6192.759999999999
won't have all these piles of dead

6189.34 --> 6200.83
insects on your floor you know it's not

6192.76 --> 6204.25
good for anyone where that happens wasps

6200.83 --> 6208.18
are evil that wasps are just very

6204.25 --> 6211.77
passive aggressive gammas they're not

6208.18 --> 6211.77
really evil they're just nasty

6215.419 --> 6221.579
just gammas but instead of a keyboard

6218.88 --> 6223.139
where they troll all day they just have

6221.579 --> 6227.308999999999
this sting and they'd like to get in

6223.139 --> 6228.179
your face and [ __ ] they're not evil

6227.309 --> 6233.820000000001
they're just

6228.179 --> 6238.01
wasps very stupid creatures just don't

6233.82 --> 6238.009999999999
leave your sugar outside that's all

6238.07 --> 6245.82
and yeah especially the things like open

6241.249 --> 6249.239
and coca-cola [ __ ] you know they know

6245.82 --> 6250.619
they'll come so no sugary drinks don't

6249.239 --> 6252.299999999999
leave them out in the open on the

6250.619 --> 6254.969
outside wasps

6252.3 --> 6263.539
they'll come if they're around in the

6254.969 --> 6268.949
neighborhood they'll be scared of bugs

6263.539 --> 6271.199
the bugs are just I don't know bucks

6268.949 --> 6274.049999999999
many bucks to me are just like animals

6271.199 --> 6275.638999999999
they're just really small and they have

6274.05 --> 6278.669
a more simple program but they're just

6275.639 --> 6281.51
like animals and just creatures they in

6278.669 --> 6285.148999999999
a way they have senses to it's not

6281.51 --> 6287.909000000001
feeling feelings but they do have like

6285.149 --> 6292.409000000001
sort of receptors for that it's weird

6287.909 --> 6298.709
how it works and bees are very gentle

6292.409 --> 6301.049999999999
creatures very gentle and there's other

6298.709 --> 6304.079
insects too like especially the bee I

6301.05 --> 6306.869000000001
like beetles beetles are cute bills

6304.079 --> 6311.36
don't harm anyone you're just sitting

6306.869 --> 6311.36
around and just eating leaves and [ __ ]

6319.84 --> 6322.47
yes

6326.52 --> 6332.67
oh oh yeah that sucks yeah you don't

6331.02 --> 6334.830000000001
want to get a wasp stuck in the

6332.67 --> 6339.47
long-sleeve shirt that's a terrible

6334.83 --> 6339.47
situation that's terrible

6348.889 --> 6352.9400000000005
yeah besides I wouldn't recommend

6350.9 --> 6355.549999999999
long-sleeve shirts during the summer

6352.94 --> 6360.44
anyhow you know why would you want to

6355.55 --> 6363.110000000001
cover that up you know it's like why

6360.44 --> 6365.78
would you even put a shirt on especially

6363.11 --> 6368.53
if you're a man you need the Sun sudden

6365.78 --> 6371.599999999999
is good just make sure you got enough

6368.53 --> 6373.969
the right stuff in your body because

6371.6 --> 6379.09
then you don't burn no you just get the

6373.969 --> 6379.09
vitamins maybe a little brown

6388.719 --> 6393.3
pick a nasty long tentacle bill what

6409.05 --> 6416.320000000001
hmm right what you have it's like

6413.28 --> 6418.69
mosquitoes stings and wasp stings are

6416.32 --> 6423.25
very different type of substance you

6418.69 --> 6424.299999999999
know like the wasp stings are just more

6423.25 --> 6428.29
it's acid

6424.3 --> 6431.83
they literally stick acid in you and it

6428.29 --> 6435.73
just hurts a lot but there's the weird

6431.83 --> 6438.22
thing there's it's technically not even

6435.73 --> 6440.23
bad for your system to get stung unless

6438.22 --> 6440.860000000001
you have allergies for it then it can be

6440.23 --> 6444.94
deadly

6440.86 --> 6447.88
you know but there's even a therapy

6444.94 --> 6450.669999999999
based on I'm getting stung it's weird

6447.88 --> 6453.43
how it's it has a thing on your body

6450.67 --> 6455.35
that can be actually kind of good yeah

6453.43 --> 6457.72
look you have to look into it just don't

6455.35 --> 6459.46
just get randomly stung because you

6457.72 --> 6464.89
think it's good for it so we're just

6459.46 --> 6466.9
gonna do that anyway but yeah net

6464.89 --> 6467.59
mosquitoes they do something entirely

6466.9 --> 6473.219999999999
different

6467.59 --> 6476.110000000001
they just inject you with a was it a

6473.22 --> 6478.18
solvent something that makes the blood

6476.11 --> 6481.929999999999
not clogged so they can suck it up and

6478.18 --> 6484.96
that [ __ ] is just it happens to it it

6481.93 --> 6488.9800000000005
causes the itch sensation a lot and can

6484.96 --> 6491.77
hang around a lot longer in a way it's

6488.98 --> 6494.169999999999
cuz if it's gonna hurt right the sting

6491.77 --> 6497.89
you're not gonna touch it you're just

6494.17 --> 6499.72
gonna be like ah hoping it'll go away

6497.89 --> 6501.52
and then eventually it'll probably go

6499.72 --> 6504.67
away you might get a muscle ache or

6501.52 --> 6507.280000000001
whatever the B are with a mosquito sting

6504.67 --> 6509.9800000000005
yeah that's that's not you're trying to

6507.28 --> 6511.63
forget it and then it's like so that can

6509.98 --> 6515.08
keep on coming back and back and back

6511.63 --> 6520.24
and the itchy affect can reinforce

6515.08 --> 6522.76
itself with histamine response and then

6520.24 --> 6524.679999999999
your body kind of makes it itch again

6522.76 --> 6527.2
it's weird how it works that doesn't

6524.68 --> 6529.240000000001
really happen with with wasp stings so I

6527.2 --> 6532.44
can imagine that you find mosquitoes a

6529.24 --> 6535.0599999999995
lot more annoying than wasps so do I

6532.44 --> 6537.009999999999
absolutely I hate mosquitoes that's why

6535.06 --> 6540.76
I like that so much because they eat

6537.01 --> 6543.3
them the only good mosquito is is to be

6540.76 --> 6543.3
eaten

6543.9 --> 6560.94
that's as far as I'm concerned it's the

6546.13 --> 6564.4800000000005
only function oh wow

6560.94 --> 6564.48
two hours already

6576.189 --> 6583.479
yeah yeah that's very sensible you have

6579.309 --> 6584.439
a yeah especially with flies because

6583.479 --> 6586.719
flies

6584.439 --> 6589.869000000001
you should probably ignore them because

6586.719 --> 6595.349
once you start hunting a fly they know

6589.869 --> 6599.018999999999
and they play with you especially the

6595.349 --> 6602.7390000000005
the more the Flies that are in warmer

6599.019 --> 6606.189
atmospheres in warmer regions so

6602.739 --> 6608.678999999999
annoying so it's best to just leave him

6606.189 --> 6610.419
alone or just try to get them out

6608.679 --> 6612.579
because when you start hitting flies

6610.419 --> 6615.01
it's like they take revenge other flies

6612.579 --> 6618.639
come and then get more in your face have

6615.01 --> 6622.749
you never experienced that with me that

6618.639 --> 6623.309
happens that's why like I never hurt a

6622.749 --> 6627.219
fly

6623.309 --> 6629.469
unless I'm like really super pissed off

6627.219 --> 6631.179
in the moment anyway and then it gets in

6629.469 --> 6632.829
my face and then I'm gonna freakin smash

6631.179 --> 6635.32
it because I'm gonna just smash

6632.829 --> 6649.949
something but that's not my standard

6635.32 --> 6652.419
response hmm yeah dragonflies yep

6649.949 --> 6656.199
dragonflies eat mosquitoes and so dude

6652.419 --> 6660.82
their larvae larvae in the water they go

6656.199 --> 6663.178999999999
after other bugs and mosquito larvae is

6660.82 --> 6663.179
also

6672.349 --> 6678.9490000000005
dragon flies there's a lot of them here

6675.829 --> 6688.829
in regions where it's like a bit swampy

6678.949 --> 6691.29
or where there's like a lake there's

6688.829 --> 6697.59
lots of dragonflies there I always like
