37.63 --> 45.559000000000005
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

41.629 --> 47.329
early-bird number 273 I'm your host

45.559 --> 49.04
Arwen and before we start to show please

47.329 --> 51.199
don't forget to share it on any platform

49.04 --> 52.879
you deem fit and also if you haven't

51.199 --> 54.41
already subscribed to my channel and hit

52.879 --> 55.94
the bell notification so you know what

54.41 --> 58.73
I'm going live which is normally 2:00

55.94 --> 61.19
p.m. amsterdam time every day also

58.73 --> 63.169999999999995
please support my channel through the

61.19 --> 65.36
super chat paypal patreon and my

63.17 --> 70.88
GoFundMe much obliged

65.36 --> 78.59
so yeah today not so warm I got my

70.88 --> 84.16999999999999
sweater on and yeah it was a really

78.59 --> 92.899
beautiful morning though and my dad came

84.17 --> 95.9
over and he had some equipment and that

92.899 --> 100.79
I'm gonna use to basically bypass the

95.9 --> 105.88000000000001
internet issue it's really cool

100.79 --> 115.759
thingy like it's the all-in-one Internet

105.88 --> 120.04899999999999
wrench very cool you can use those plugs

115.759 --> 123.229
and put them on well the cords and then

120.049 --> 128.479
do everything with this just this one

123.229 --> 129.89
thing it's a really cool one so I am no

128.479 --> 133.25
longer gonna have Internet issues

129.89 --> 135.51899999999998
probably after this week looking forward

133.25 --> 135.519
to that

138.92 --> 145.5
it's gonna be a full lined connection so

144.36 --> 151.14000000000001
that's gonna be lovely

145.5 --> 153.989
let's see you is in chat all right we

151.14 --> 159.48
got a smile out who was actually first

153.989 --> 164.37
Wow and righteous force AGM Amanda young

159.48 --> 168.69
a gem had to leave I think pretty soon

164.37 --> 173.849
and thanks for popping by over moco

168.69 --> 182.16
right oh yeah March force pumpkin yeah

173.849 --> 187.379
good to see you all yeah let's see yeah

182.16 --> 189.569
I was watching a a new earth video just

187.379 --> 191.819
before this Eden was really good it's

189.569 --> 194.45899999999997
one hour and it's basically her just

191.819 --> 196.70899999999997
talking with a couple of background

194.459 --> 203.1
pictures some of them were really nice

196.709 --> 205.53
and interesting and some spiritual

203.1 --> 210.23
advice and yes she's known to do that

205.53 --> 213.989
and I think that she has a very refined

210.23 --> 217.319
sense of her own frequency and I find

213.989 --> 222.18
that very compelling her arguments are

217.319 --> 225.23899999999998
often very compelling to me and it's

222.18 --> 228.98000000000002
always good to listen and I definitely

225.239 --> 232.47
spotted some things she mentioned that

228.98 --> 234.98899999999998
that are like risk factors and that I do

232.47 --> 237.0
engage in and it just it's good to like

234.989 --> 239.609
hear it from somebody that I can

237.0 --> 241.98
actually respect spiritually because

239.609 --> 245.669
they they're really putting a lot of

241.98 --> 250.16899999999998
focus on doing that right so it's good

245.669 --> 254.18
and I don't know I'll see where it goes

250.169 --> 254.18
I'm good just gonna let it sink

256.81 --> 271.6
I forgot to check the bear did he have a

261.459 --> 274.69
video Oh hmm he did dammit why the hats

271.6 --> 278.77000000000004
hate the Russians oh man I gotta watch

274.69 --> 283.51
that one that's that's gonna be

278.77 --> 290.94
fascinating yeah anyway hey Brenda M

283.51 --> 294.78999999999996
hello Brenda huh what else went down oh

290.94 --> 296.68
yeah my internet went down yesterday in

294.79 --> 299.86
the middle of the debates I wasn't there

296.68 --> 302.14
I wasn't all that active most laying in

299.86 --> 304.09000000000003
the background got a little little

302.14 --> 308.32
chatty in there and then at some point

304.09 --> 311.07
that just internet broke my roommate

308.32 --> 314.26
that is in that room wasn't home and

311.07 --> 315.49
only two hours later he came back so yep

314.26 --> 318.37
that was it

315.49 --> 323.229
I completely missed out on everything

318.37 --> 330.88
Elex Jones as well oh yeah watch the

323.229 --> 333.24
movie again Birdman very cool very cool

330.88 --> 333.24
movie

334.97 --> 341.3
uh-huh I always do that every time I

338.12 --> 344.36
internet goes down I I just do stuff you

341.3 --> 346.16
know and then I end up watching a movie

344.36 --> 348.44
that I have on my computer downloaded

346.16 --> 350.74
and this time it was Birdman and it's

348.44 --> 357.41
like the second time I seen it very

350.74 --> 361.72
interesting it's a very artistic movie

357.41 --> 365.48
in the sense that it's very focused on

361.72 --> 369.68
on camera works on stage works and it's

365.48 --> 372.86
basically one giant nonstop shot the

369.68 --> 374.54
entire movie it's pretty crazy but I did

372.86 --> 376.28000000000003
detect a certain points where they

374.54 --> 378.26000000000005
definitely did trickery because they

376.28 --> 380.41999999999996
couldn't have possibly literally all

378.26 --> 384.02
done it in one shot so they did some

380.42 --> 388.49
real sneaky switcheroos that they could

384.02 --> 392.53999999999996
use to cut seen it and I did catch a

388.49 --> 396.25
couple of them maybe two or three but

392.54 --> 400.79
it's just a very ingeniously made movie

396.25 --> 403.39
so yeah if you haven't seen that it's

400.79 --> 407.83000000000004
called Birdman it's about actors it's a

403.39 --> 410.9
yeah really about Broadway type stage

407.83 --> 415.52
musicals and all that not or as a stage

410.9 --> 417.62
acting and very behind the scene it's

415.52 --> 419.35999999999996
literally you get to see every part of

417.62 --> 424.31
the whole block basically it's

419.36 --> 426.66900000000004
fascinating so if you yeah you get bored

424.31 --> 431.05
sometimes find that movie

426.669 --> 431.04999999999995
it's from let's see

439.72 --> 442.72
yeah

443.12 --> 446.339
[Music]

447.469 --> 451.55
yeah 2014

455.95 --> 458.67
all right

462.919 --> 475.729
yeah well duh the meets gang what do you

466.759 --> 480.77000000000004
think but I don't know I thought it it

475.729 --> 481.909
was the movie is not super corrupt as it

480.77 --> 487.75899999999996
it's not evil

481.909 --> 490.52
it's very neutral and very exposed you

487.759 --> 493.969
really get to see the personal things

490.52 --> 495.979
it's it's a well-crafted movie and you

493.969 --> 498.409
better believe that the house so small

495.979 --> 500.0
are part of this probably some of the

498.409 --> 504.86
actors are I'm not a hundred percent

500.0 --> 508.939
sure but of course but as Owen Benjamin

504.86 --> 512.3000000000001
says no small hats are are all rotten

508.939 --> 515.51
and I don't know this seems like a

512.3 --> 521.169
unicorn movie with a true owed and loved

515.51 --> 521.169
for before the craft doesn't work

525.36 --> 534.839
oh and it's like zero CGI I think well

532.199 --> 536.819
in retrospect some things would have

534.839 --> 540.629
probably been done with CGI because

536.819 --> 544.6189999999999
doing that in real is very dangerous but

540.629 --> 547.8290000000001
now did they you if they use CGI they

544.619 --> 549.869
did it exactly how you should and not

547.829 --> 552.1189999999999
like make half the movie about it or

549.869 --> 555.269
look at how good it is made but it

552.119 --> 557.279
should be used to fill up things to take

555.269 --> 560.069
away certain risks without people

557.279 --> 562.709
noticing that is the best way to apply

560.069 --> 566.459
it and that move the people that made

562.709 --> 570.3789999999999
the movie really got that so I don't

566.459 --> 570.3789999999999
know it's a good one

570.7 --> 573.769
[Music]

580.68 --> 589.4899999999999
yeah l'addition Ciriaco Karen B because

587.009 --> 589.49
it's flat

590.75 --> 595.389
all right so yeah I watch that enjoyed

593.18 --> 595.3889999999999
it

599.019 --> 609.069
watched a huge amount of the Big Bang

606.319 --> 611.74
Theory which is it's kind of weird

609.069 --> 614.36
because I'm starting to see a shift

611.74 --> 619.129
basically in the show it pretty much

614.36 --> 623.9300000000001
went through two seasons in two or three

619.129 --> 627.6800000000001
days it's weird it's like it's becoming

623.93 --> 630.67
more stereotyped and they're they seem

627.68 --> 633.3499999999999
to be working away from personal details

630.67 --> 635.75
because they are pretty much set and

633.35 --> 637.759
there's not a lot of character change

635.75 --> 639.5
like real change is usually just a

637.759 --> 644.24
slight loop and then it just ends up

639.5 --> 647.0
back where they started but they're now

644.24 --> 649.04
just more manoeuvring so instead of the

647.0 --> 650.6
individuals it's become more like a play

649.04 --> 651.92
board with these different characters

650.6 --> 654.47
and it's kind of cool because they're

651.92 --> 657.559
bringing bringing back characters that

654.47 --> 661.3090000000001
were kind of like side notes and they

657.559 --> 666.35
work them out pretty decently so it it's

661.309 --> 669.529
different you it's starting to gradually

666.35 --> 675.2900000000001
we're a bit it's not surprising it's

669.529 --> 677.72
like seven or eight season now what's

675.29 --> 680.75
still amusing and it's really like a

677.72 --> 682.1890000000001
binge watch thing the only thing that I

680.75 --> 683.87
really have to do is skip that damn

682.189 --> 687.86
intro because it's really really

683.87 --> 690.139
annoying cuz they like big bang nice

687.86 --> 692.389
song flashy flashy fantastic mega

690.139 --> 694.66
indoctrination yeah I definitely want to

692.389 --> 700.12
skip that one

694.66 --> 700.12
and that's it

707.5 --> 714.41
other than that I think a lot has been

710.18 --> 716.9899999999999
going down again ranty is drawing I

714.41 --> 721.12
don't watch it but I just hear he does

716.99 --> 721.12
definitely attract a lot of rumors with

723.85 --> 732.529
yeah but now rumpus is basically taken

730.22 --> 742.029
over I heard recently or was that

732.529 --> 742.029
somewhere else I don't know yeah

743.97 --> 753.58
from what I get it seems to be getting

746.53 --> 756.37
Messier and Messier also I heard a rumor

753.58 --> 759.88
that Brenda went berserk again just as

756.37 --> 769.09
bad as that last time that true I don't

759.88 --> 772.02
know I I really don't even care that

769.09 --> 772.02
much to be fair

776.2 --> 781.63
I have been thinking a lot more deeply

779.32 --> 783.7900000000001
again about quantum mechanics though it

781.63 --> 787.5
was the one premiere again from

783.79 --> 792.12
ball-busters about light is a particle

787.5 --> 795.76
well yeah I saw that I was in chat and I

792.12 --> 798.04
thought I was just gonna be fun trolling

795.76 --> 799.6899999999999
but this was actually the first time I

798.04 --> 802.8
watched the entire thing I hadn't

799.69 --> 806.2900000000001
watched it and as I was watching it I

802.8 --> 812.16
did really strangled me like what the

806.29 --> 816.2199999999999
hell is this that is total wizardry [ __ ]

812.16 --> 818.829
it's a total it's amping up the pressure

816.22 --> 821.0500000000001
then jumbling around showing some things

818.829 --> 824.26
without explaining it it is like the

821.05 --> 829.5699999999999
arrogance and it was terrible and it

824.26 --> 832.06
didn't prove [ __ ] and again after

829.57 --> 834.85
afterwards just getting stuck in the

832.06 --> 841.3199999999999
indie false dichotomy of particle wave

834.85 --> 847.86
it's ridiculous I thought it was really

841.32 --> 847.86
disappointing I really did

858.33 --> 863.7800000000001
yeah it should be a lot easier to prove

860.52 --> 868.8299999999999
it turns out that proving the

863.78 --> 871.7099999999999
double-slit experiment the nowhere

868.83 --> 874.47
effect seems to be almost as difficult

871.71 --> 877.59
as trying to prove mass attracting mass

874.47 --> 880.02
with the Cavendish experiment because

877.59 --> 882.75
that's something you don't just do like

880.02 --> 887.04
that now you have to do a lot of time

882.75 --> 889.77
and then the true trust [ __ ] it's a mess

887.04 --> 894.15
and with this one whatever he showed it

889.77 --> 897.23
just didn't show anything it's just like

894.15 --> 900.7099999999999
Oh a machine it's a machine no lasers

897.23 --> 900.71
blah blah blah

910.23 --> 914.6700000000001
right

912.29 --> 918.23
so

914.67 --> 920.9399999999999
it seems that others have also caught on

918.23 --> 923.61
people that don't fit my chat all that

920.94 --> 925.8290000000001
often have caught on to the beam concept

923.61 --> 928.37
which still stands although it's

925.829 --> 930.8
slightly more complicated concerning the

928.37 --> 933.42
light actually having a speed

930.8 --> 937.14
empirically proven to me I'm gonna take

933.42 --> 939.899
that but yeah the beam concept that is

937.14 --> 942.329
potentially infinitely divisible in

939.899 --> 945.029
nature still stands and all these

942.329 --> 949.0699999999999
supposed proofs of the old the particle

945.029 --> 956.16
minimum is still very much disputable

949.07 --> 960.0
very very much so because yeah what

956.16 --> 965.01
quantum eraser literally did was claimed

960.0 --> 969.66
okay because of the process what is it

965.01 --> 972.5889999999999
I forget the name sorry guys the

969.66 --> 974.85
exchange where the electron is released

972.589 --> 977.1600000000001
because of the absorption of the

974.85 --> 980.12
sunlight changing it that effect

977.16 --> 984.42
photoelectric effect I think it was that

980.12 --> 987.6
proved it was a particle well no it

984.42 --> 990.149
literally proved that right apparently

987.6 --> 994.529
it has an exchange effect but it's going

990.149 --> 996.66
to be bound by well whatever type of

994.529 --> 999.42
particle or matter it's going to be

996.66 --> 1002.39
interacting with because yeah the light

999.42 --> 1007.579
comes then build the energy builds up

1002.39 --> 1011.149
until the critical the minimum the

1007.579 --> 1015.2299999999999
minimum line for the effect to transit

1011.149 --> 1018.32
to initiate that's what's that's based

1015.23 --> 1022.399
on doesn't prove that there's literally

1018.32 --> 1025.429
light balls units hitting and then like

1022.399 --> 1030.98
oh it hit click no that doesn't prove

1025.429 --> 1032.9
that at all so yeah light being a beam

1030.98 --> 1038.059
and that bring in all kinds of

1032.9 --> 1041.959
possibilities and throwing a lot of

1038.059 --> 1045.05
nonsense off the table like theorizing

1041.959 --> 1048.05
how a particle could split up and then

1045.05 --> 1050.96
fuse back together that kind of nonsense

1048.05 --> 1055.309
it's totally unnecessary if you just

1050.96 --> 1058.4
conceptualize because you should that

1055.309 --> 1060.95
light can definitely be divided of the

1058.4 --> 1073.3000000000002
energy amounts much further than is

1060.95 --> 1073.3
officially admitted hello Nathan

1074.32 --> 1077.32
really

1089.03 --> 1094.11
well Nathan oh I'm getting from you so

1091.98 --> 1096.299
far it's your just yes manning

1094.11 --> 1098.76
everything that quantum eraser says

1096.299 --> 1100.47
because obviously you're not really

1098.76 --> 1107.19
getting it and you've even admitted it

1100.47 --> 1110.25
at times but I do get it more I'm not in

1107.19 --> 1113.909
the total I don't I haven't absorbed

1110.25 --> 1117.84
everything yet but I am very sharp as I

1113.909 --> 1121.38
go and I do notice things and I and I'm

1117.84 --> 1126.78
not afraid to go everywhere and approach

1121.38 --> 1129.5700000000002
this with the same the same magnifying

1126.78 --> 1131.94
glass as we have been approaching the

1129.57 --> 1134.28
globe oars on the flat at the base I'm

1131.94 --> 1136.23
not afraid to do that at all on my show

1134.28 --> 1139.559
by the way because I don't really feel

1136.23 --> 1141.929
like going at quantum eraser on your

1139.559 --> 1145.02
show because I don't want to be another

1141.929 --> 1146.4
anon or write the hand I don't want to

1145.02 --> 1149.34
go I don't want a bicker

1146.4 --> 1152.789
okay I'm sick of the bickering [ __ ] so

1149.34 --> 1155.549
I'm just not unless quantum eraser

1152.789 --> 1158.73
promises me he'll actually behave like a

1155.549 --> 1161.1
normal human being and discussing this

1158.73 --> 1164.25
and discussing my doubts and my concepts

1161.1 --> 1167.01
and seeking clarification about things

1164.25 --> 1169.19
then I'm not gonna go discuss this with

1167.01 --> 1169.19
him

1182.67 --> 1189.44
oh great it's a fake fake Nathan that's

1185.64 --> 1189.44
just that's just great

1190.67 --> 1206.99
okay well got me there troll very very

1198.15 --> 1206.99
sneaky of you yeah

1218.269 --> 1225.889
yeah yeah

1221.799 --> 1231.9189999999999
potatoes are cool and tasty yeah it was

1225.889 --> 1238.279
a fake Nathan zero subscriber yeah they

1231.919 --> 1240.95
love to trick me and hey what he said

1238.279 --> 1244.959
like if Nathan was in kind of a trolling

1240.95 --> 1244.959
mood he could have just said that so it

1245.619 --> 1251.289
it was very sneaky very sneaky troll

1262.74 --> 1271.02
yes yes check oh I have considered it

1265.47 --> 1275.1000000000001
and I considered that I don't want to do

1271.02 --> 1277.8
that maybe I'll write a secret book

1275.1 --> 1279.48
about it and then after I die yeah if

1277.8 --> 1281.78
people still want to read it they can

1279.48 --> 1284.78
but I don't want to be bothered with

1281.78 --> 1289.62
that because if I'm gonna write about it

1284.78 --> 1291.78
then I should write about it in full if

1289.62 --> 1294.75
I start censoring and it's not gonna

1291.78 --> 1297.3899999999999
make any sense and that means that I

1294.75 --> 1299.28
throw out all the horrors that I've been

1297.39 --> 1304.8600000000001
subjected to and that's just not

1299.28 --> 1322.3799999999999
something you want to do while you're

1304.86 --> 1325.49
still alive huh well maybe I'd call it

1322.38 --> 1325.49
to hell and back

1331.46 --> 1336.97
kind of a funny Lord of the Ring

1334.43 --> 1336.97
reference

1338.09 --> 1341.25
[Music]

1345.59 --> 1348.59
anyway

1354.62 --> 1360.9189999999999
yeah that's not gonna happen but yeah I

1358.19 --> 1365.269
can reflect upon my visions plenty of

1360.919 --> 1367.46
people have questions and I still the

1365.269 --> 1370.85
whole thing about it is that I was just

1367.46 --> 1372.95
going through so many details I could

1370.85 --> 1375.32
see so much clearer in there so I did

1372.95 --> 1378.679
learn incredible amounts of things

1375.32 --> 1381.559
including things that I in retrospect

1378.679 --> 1383.6000000000001
really don't even want to know what that

1381.559 --> 1385.309
I even yeah I just couldn't help it

1383.6 --> 1388.629
because I had the opportunity for it

1385.309 --> 1388.629
it's just weird how that works

1395.08 --> 1404.019
about thankfully I have the past keep

1399.799 --> 1404.019
all the [ __ ] at bay

1407.619 --> 1411.519
fellowship of the plane

1422.39 --> 1432.23
no the Illuminati it does not not

1425.72 --> 1434.1200000000001
anymore because it did like this weird

1432.23 --> 1439.31
how that coincided the memories of it

1434.12 --> 1442.55
pretty much 2014 and before that as well

1439.31 --> 1446.48
it's just it wasn't still I didn't

1442.55 --> 1448.3
understand what it was before that and

1446.48 --> 1451.6100000000001
when you don't understand what it is

1448.3 --> 1454.6299999999999
then your your imagination can go wild

1451.61 --> 1458.87
with that and torture you with that [ __ ]

1454.63 --> 1463.3700000000001
but I've since figured out what it

1458.87 --> 1465.9799999999998
really is and by that nature I can't

1463.37 --> 1471.1999999999998
fear it anymore because I understand

1465.98 --> 1473.59
that that is exactly what it what where

1471.2 --> 1473.5900000000001
it came from

1488.309 --> 1491.309
yeah

1500.2 --> 1503.97
a Emmerich's jmock

1520.539 --> 1523.229
yeah

1523.52 --> 1531.02
well silchenko that yeah you can always

1528.95 --> 1537.41
use it as inspiration to create some

1531.02 --> 1545.179
sort of high fantasy well I do in the

1537.41 --> 1547.25
sense that the concepts of it and that

1545.179 --> 1549.8300000000002
type of experience and even the meaning

1547.25 --> 1553.51
of it to a person and how that feels I

1549.83 --> 1557.8999999999999
know how to emulate that for others and

1553.51 --> 1563.03
I apply it in in my in my fantasy games

1557.9 --> 1566.96
in my D&D world I really it is almost

1563.03 --> 1570.26
like a life movie through the mind and I

1566.96 --> 1572.3600000000001
use I construct the scenario and emulate

1570.26 --> 1576.559
the feelings based on some things that

1572.36 --> 1581.4699999999998
I've seen and then manifested and then

1576.559 --> 1581.47
and it just resonates and it works

1616.87 --> 1621.299
I have no reason to return

1627.55 --> 1635.08
because I already know what my nemesis

1630.04 --> 1638.53
is the nemesis is always you so wish

1635.08 --> 1640.36
yourself aspects about yourself that

1638.53 --> 1643.47
draw you into the darkness that is what

1640.36 --> 1651.82
it is that is literally what it all is

1643.47 --> 1654.76
but in a very complex system so you

1651.82 --> 1657.1299999999999
could conceptualize the demons or these

1654.76 --> 1662.29
extra dimensional entities however you

1657.13 --> 1666.6100000000001
want to see it they can only harass you

1662.29 --> 1669.34
or torture you with your own sins with

1666.61 --> 1671.8
your own mistakes your own foolishness

1669.34 --> 1677.98
your own cowardice your own fears all

1671.8 --> 1679.51
that [ __ ] and that is what that is and

1677.98 --> 1684.1200000000001
if there are parts of you that you have

1679.51 --> 1686.98
pure and that the knowing the trust

1684.12 --> 1691.1799999999998
beyond at all and the realize the

1686.98 --> 1693.34
ability to let those darkness go part by

1691.18 --> 1697.39
parts that is where they have become

1693.34 --> 1699.6999999999998
totally helpless and this is even

1697.39 --> 1702.7
reflected into workings of the real

1699.7 --> 1708.91
world our society it works it's the same

1702.7 --> 1710.68
kind of system uncanny but yeah pretty

1708.91 --> 1714.5800000000002
sure that the people that built this

1710.68 --> 1717.28
didn't get that system by chance they

1714.58 --> 1720.8999999999999
definitely had designed it inspired on a

1717.28 --> 1720.8999999999999
certain other type of experience

1725.73 --> 1728.73
what

1736.8 --> 1742.46
Oh Benjamin what are you talking about

1751.68 --> 1754.25
what

1766.159 --> 1773.419
getting way too distracted here yeah

1782.07 --> 1791.22
anyway I'm happy to report that probably

1786.96 --> 1793.6200000000001
because of the severity the punishment I

1791.22 --> 1796.6200000000001
received during my visions that I have

1793.62 --> 1799.1999999999998
been able to overcome so much because

1796.62 --> 1803.58
otherwise I'd never had the motivation

1799.2 --> 1806.43
to do that because what it also showed

1803.58 --> 1813.3899999999999
in many aspects that it seemed to be

1806.43 --> 1817.2
very easy is what would happen if if I

1813.39 --> 1819.45
if I didn't overcome it's almost like

1817.2 --> 1821.3700000000001
the freaking Christmas story you know

1819.45 --> 1823.8
what's the one that goes to past

1821.37 --> 1826.34
Christmas and all that it's very much

1823.8 --> 1829.2
like that it's like okay you have this

1826.34 --> 1831.48
you're not going to stop it okay so this

1829.2 --> 1833.91
is what's gonna happen like with you you

1831.48 --> 1836.84
literally get a future simulation of

1833.91 --> 1841.71
yourself in a like a parallel dimension

1836.84 --> 1844.32
experience and I'm thank God that I

1841.71 --> 1848.94
realized that now because I've seen even

1844.32 --> 1851.31
myself do like creepy criminal [ __ ] that

1848.94 --> 1858.18
I could just it's impossible for me to

1851.31 --> 1860.37
do that I'm so glad my god there's just

1858.18 --> 1863.01
no way that could arrive to that

1860.37 --> 1865.9499999999998
situation but it would simulate like as

1863.01 --> 1867.56
if like like yeah this is gonna happen

1865.95 --> 1875.13
if you don't work on that

1867.56 --> 1877.6499999999999
it's freaky as hell and the funny thing

1875.13 --> 1880.68
though I do also remember even as I got

1877.65 --> 1884.5400000000002
out of that that I knew that I had

1880.68 --> 1888.9
succeeded a at that time I knew like

1884.54 --> 1891.54
that's a simulation that's part of the

1888.9 --> 1893.7
test that's not real that's not really

1891.54 --> 1895.68
gonna happen also because I learned the

1893.7 --> 1898.14
lesson it's very complex

1895.68 --> 1901.41
interdimensional [ __ ] consequences and

1898.14 --> 1903.75
all that but then later because of the

1901.41 --> 1905.4
entire shock of the overall experience

1903.75 --> 1907.08
because that was basically a sub

1905.4 --> 1910.17
experience of the whole thing the eighty

1907.08 --> 1913.35
years because everything eventually was

1910.17 --> 1915.5700000000002
too much I forgot most of it and I just

1913.35 --> 1918.36
get like flashes of

1915.57 --> 1920.6699999999998
Heights and I don't even understand the

1918.36 --> 1922.85
context of it and that at first made me

1920.67 --> 1926.67
think like oh my god

1922.85 --> 1928.23
what's gonna happen to me I see this the

1926.67 --> 1931.5600000000002
creepiest [ __ ] ever

1928.23 --> 1934.2
and now finally after so long and after

1931.56 --> 1937.71
having it all come back to me and slowly

1934.2 --> 1939.78
sinking it letting it sink it's clearing

1937.71 --> 1943.56
up I've even explained it and I can just

1939.78 --> 1947.31
see wait this experience was in that

1943.56 --> 1951.99
compartment sub experience right there

1947.31 --> 1954.99
during this line and that thing that I

1951.99 --> 1958.32
saw was totally different from another

1954.99 --> 1960.51
age for from another time that I got to

1958.32 --> 1963.0
look in again from when I was younger

1960.51 --> 1966.51
that I simply got the C's in a simulated

1963.0 --> 1969.24
fashion was extremely shocking so I see

1966.51 --> 1972.5
so much clearer now and that also takes

1969.24 --> 1972.5
away a lot of the fear

2002.45 --> 2007.01
oh by the way happy to report and we'll

2005.45 --> 2008.8700000000001
see how long that lasts that since

2007.01 --> 2011.23
yesterday I'm above fourteen hundred

2008.87 --> 2014.4199999999998
subscribers woohoo

2011.23 --> 2015.98
so thanks everyone that has newly

2014.42 --> 2019.13
subscribed and of course my old

2015.98 --> 2022.18
subscribers as well hope the show is

2019.13 --> 2025.4
still worth watching to you guys

2022.18 --> 2029.18
despite sometimes the long pauses of

2025.4 --> 2032.0900000000001
silence trying to fish around in chat

2029.18 --> 2034.04
see if I can catch a good question or a

2032.09 --> 2046.73
good train of thought to latch onto and

2034.04 --> 2049.48
work with oh no god somebody's there's a

2046.73 --> 2049.48
serious soccer

2056.64 --> 2064.7999999999997
somebody got the the high-tech sock tool

2061.31 --> 2068.67
or somebody is really bored and spending

2064.8 --> 2072.6800000000003
a lot of time on that boredom probably

2068.67 --> 2072.6800000000003
both anyway

2078.32 --> 2082.7200000000003
I thank so many young I do my best

2088.679 --> 2091.609
hmm

2095.669 --> 2103.749
yeah I just saw the premier announcement

2099.069 --> 2110.529
so indeed there is no live show boo how

2103.749 --> 2117.9399999999996
disappointing yeah

2110.529 --> 2121.39
I could of course open up panel here if

2117.94 --> 2126.5190000000002
people would like to hey I see Brenda is

2121.39 --> 2128.999
finally there she's not saying anything

2126.519 --> 2128.999
now

2149.3 --> 2152.449
[Music]

2167.83 --> 2176.35
yep let me is going to this show is

2170.56 --> 2179.62
definitely not meant to rage I try to

2176.35 --> 2181.72
prevent that at all cost sometimes I

2179.62 --> 2188.95
might get really unusually pissed off

2181.72 --> 2193.5
about something but for two hours again

2188.95 --> 2193.5
I'm under young how am I gonna do that

2194.82 --> 2201.46
I'm gonna be I'm gonna be glad if I

2198.73 --> 2206.02
can't fill another half an hour because

2201.46 --> 2210.88
I don't know it's not a lot of

2206.02 --> 2213.27
technicals I could get back into the

2210.88 --> 2215.65
whole quantum mechanics thing before the

2213.27 --> 2222.69
hmm before the Nathan Oakley sock

2215.65 --> 2222.69
distracted me away from that but yeah

2224.55 --> 2234.75
I've just been thinking over and over

2227.59 --> 2238.1200000000003
about the whole how electrons supposedly

2234.75 --> 2241.12
electricity and light magnetic fields

2238.12 --> 2244.0899999999997
supposedly work sometimes like a wave

2241.12 --> 2247.18
sometimes like a particle and what that

2244.09 --> 2249.1800000000003
really is because I think there's some

2247.18 --> 2252.39
kind of conceptual misunderstanding

2249.18 --> 2252.39
going on

2258.0 --> 2265.41
but I I guess I'm gonna need to wade

2261.57 --> 2270.26
through more of all the math models and

2265.41 --> 2276.45
everything in order to see it to see

2270.26 --> 2278.7900000000004
what the problem really is and see if I

2276.45 --> 2282.1699999999996
could create something alternative like

2278.79 --> 2285.42
a beam based concept that is not

2282.17 --> 2288.119
obstructed by some kind of minimum

2285.42 --> 2291.48
particle or anything minimum amount of

2288.119 --> 2296.849
energy and then see if it works out

2291.48 --> 2298.41
better also by the way as a word in a

2296.849 --> 2300.21
more general thing I've also been

2298.41 --> 2303.23
thinking about the whole double slit

2300.21 --> 2306.0
effect not not some experiment but just

2303.23 --> 2309.21
the pattern that comes out of two slits

2306.0 --> 2313.26
in a position to one and what that

2309.21 --> 2316.65
really is how how does that actually

2313.26 --> 2319.98
work because that is maybe one of the

2316.65 --> 2323.849
more mysterious effects to me that that

2319.98 --> 2326.07
just happens in general rather than

2323.849 --> 2328.05
trying to figure out what the pattern is

2326.07 --> 2332.88
so why would it do that

2328.05 --> 2337.65
in a position to a single slit like what

2332.88 --> 2339.599
is really going on and I'd like to test

2337.65 --> 2341.94
it out like can you split up the slits

2339.599 --> 2345.77
it would be so interesting if you had

2341.94 --> 2349.26
like a perfect perfect surface control

2345.77 --> 2352.589
almost like a moon let's think like

2349.26 --> 2354.48
sci-fi hi-tech now in like a a system

2352.589 --> 2356.7
with many blocks that you could

2354.48 --> 2360.349
literally program a computer to arrange

2356.7 --> 2363.6899999999996
it forever finally just immediately

2360.349 --> 2366.3
created slits and that you can widen

2363.69 --> 2368.82
them very perfectly and do all kinds of

2366.3 --> 2371.52
things and then just experiment with

2368.82 --> 2374.4
that see like what are the type of

2371.52 --> 2378.839
effects that come out of it when does it

2374.4 --> 2380.7000000000003
become a wave when does it refract up in

2378.839 --> 2383.4
the wave like pattern and all that like

2380.7 --> 2385.91
when does that start to engage figure

2383.4 --> 2385.9100000000003
that out

2387.75 --> 2394.24
because I don't think that quantum

2391.81 --> 2399.16
mechanics really even addresses that as

2394.24 --> 2402.0699999999997
much it doesn't feel like it I don't

2399.16 --> 2407.47
know maybe I'm just not far enough into

2402.07 --> 2410.1400000000003
looking into it to see that yet but I am

2407.47 --> 2413.1499999999996
fascinated simply by the fact that a

2410.14 --> 2416.719
light apparently does do that

2413.15 --> 2416.719
[Music]

2527.47 --> 2536.6499999999996
while I was away I was just thinking the

2533.64 --> 2543.2799999999997
the wave-like pattern of light with the

2536.65 --> 2549.58
double slits right that effect can it be

2543.28 --> 2552.5800000000004
emulated with ray tracing does it work

2549.58 --> 2557.29
the same because if that could be

2552.58 --> 2561.79
emulated then it it must be understood

2557.29 --> 2566.68
or is that something that doesn't act

2561.79 --> 2569.5299999999997
that's not a meal a table in in a 3d

2566.68 --> 2571.8689999999997
virtual realm that is literally it is

2569.53 --> 2574.5400000000004
ray tracing it is an emulation of the

2571.869 --> 2577.09
function of light that's why it is kind

2574.54 --> 2579.52
of semi realistic up to really realistic

2577.09 --> 2585.01
because it is emulating optics so I

2579.52 --> 2589.359
wonder does the double slit effect can

2585.01 --> 2591.67
that be simulated naturally within a

2589.359 --> 2596.83
good-quality ray tracer does that

2591.67 --> 2599.31
actually happen by itself because of the

2596.83 --> 2602.0499999999997
design or is it something they can

2599.31 --> 2606.369
emulate and that is part of the mystery

2602.05 --> 2608.98
I wonder now because I do know that it

2606.369 --> 2610.9900000000002
definitely does happen in the real world

2608.98 --> 2613.42
it's not that difficult to achieve the

2610.99 --> 2618.3689999999997
effect but can they actually retrace

2613.42 --> 2624.4500000000003
that effect just came to me I I've never

2618.369 --> 2624.4500000000003
seen it being emulated have you

2637.83 --> 2649.71
that is just wrong neil w there is no

2645.93 --> 2653.1499999999996
dual nature it's misunderstood it's not

2649.71 --> 2655.86
a particle it's not a wave really

2653.15 --> 2659.52
there's something else go long there's

2655.86 --> 2661.77
some kind of interference pattern

2659.52 --> 2664.7
literally so yeah how is that

2661.77 --> 2664.7
interfering why

2675.0 --> 2685.79
okay the Illuminati well I what

2686.35 --> 2690.49
look I am not thinking about waves and

2688.9 --> 2695.8
particles that's what they're working

2690.49 --> 2697.6
with I think a beam connection that does

2695.8 --> 2700.3300000000004
have a speed apparently I don't even

2697.6 --> 2706.41
know why that's also part of finding out

2700.33 --> 2709.15
what is why is it not instantaneous and

2706.41 --> 2712.0
why does it work the way does all that

2709.15 --> 2714.01
what is actually going on and I think

2712.0 --> 2719.44
that it might be just a infinitely

2714.01 --> 2722.53
divisible beam and not a yeah minima

2719.44 --> 2725.4700000000003
quanta particle or anything yeah or a

2722.53 --> 2730.0
wave because a wave is not it's not even

2725.47 --> 2732.5499999999997
a thing a wave is a medium transfer it's

2730.0 --> 2736.78
a medium pattern so it doesn't make any

2732.55 --> 2739.7200000000003
sense the medium of what so what is

2736.78 --> 2744.01
actually happening then if it's a wave

2739.72 --> 2753.0099999999998
of what what is light a wave of if it

2744.01 --> 2755.23
would be a wave so I'm just not certain

2753.01 --> 2757.8300000000004
about it I think there's more to figure

2755.23 --> 2757.83
out about it

2770.04 --> 2773.66
huh interesting

2779.339 --> 2787.409
but that doesn't explain anything though

2781.829 --> 2790.079
Neal W nothing first you say Oh particle

2787.409 --> 2794.839
Wraith and then UV light hits metal

2790.079 --> 2797.489
surface an emission of electrons so how

2794.839 --> 2799.8289999999997
does that prove anything it is simply

2797.489 --> 2802.099
the again a specific type of light that

2799.829 --> 2806.2490000000003
has a certain influence and then

2802.099 --> 2817.039
eventually it reacts with matter and the

2806.249 --> 2817.0389999999998
electron is exchanged so get out here

2833.58 --> 2836.42
hmm

2840.54 --> 2849.36
well Illuminati that sounds like a giant

2843.54 --> 2857.2799999999997
pile of science-fiction nonsense let's

2849.36 --> 2859.94
see what dashing forward it two slits

2857.28 --> 2859.94
all right

2873.36 --> 2877.32
okay interesting

2880.099 --> 2885.619
that's fascinating thanks for sharing

2882.499 --> 2889.999
that huh

2885.619 --> 2895.989
I I should have probably shown that

2889.999 --> 2895.9889999999996
sorry guys let's see I can still do that

2897.309 --> 2900.369
all right

2902.52 --> 2908.1
so it is apparently a guy doing just

2907.619 --> 2912.36
that

2908.1 --> 2914.69
or at least applying it with the laser I

2912.36 --> 2914.69
think

2933.34 --> 2941.56
yeah wait hold on let me do that again

2936.1 --> 2943.98
oh yeah oh wow it switches it pretty

2941.56 --> 2943.98
rapidly

2948.43 --> 2951.48
see it again

2979.53 --> 2982.3700000000003
okay

2983.42 --> 2990.13
right uh yeah it's old and I could have

2988.369 --> 2994.94
done a better job I think but yeah you

2990.13 --> 2998.029
look at me how many decades later so but

2994.94 --> 3001.029
still good stuff it's at least a some

2998.029 --> 3004.42
kind of demonstration how it changes oh

3001.029 --> 3006.9
wait let me show this part get split up

3004.42 --> 3006.9
even further

3027.109 --> 3034.13
hmm anyway yeah that was kind of worth

3030.2 --> 3037.959
sharing so thanks for that

3034.13 --> 3037.9590000000003
Oh what another one

3053.39 --> 3056.5699999999997
[Music]

3062.4 --> 3067.64
wait is that the same one oh no wait

3085.25 --> 3088.25
2:40

3088.92 --> 3093.65
okay let's see

3108.47 --> 3112.18
I hope everyone can see this

3115.89 --> 3119.029
no wait that

3174.35 --> 3177.5299999999997
[Music]

3187.68 --> 3193.1699999999996
yep

3190.329 --> 3193.17
okay

3193.24 --> 3199.24
anyway this is just yeah the kind of

3195.91 --> 3202.319
like what I described and how how does

3199.24 --> 3202.319
that split up

3207.15 --> 3216.9300000000003
so it yeah can definitely you can change

3214.019 --> 3219.859
the wave the apparent wave-like pattern

3216.93 --> 3219.859
apparently

3225.369 --> 3234.779
anyway yeah this yeah thanks for sharing

3229.69 --> 3234.779
that vision was interesting

3255.15 --> 3258.219
[Music]

3263.14 --> 3269.019
good point mark colored it should

3266.249 --> 3272.2
definitely also be tested with sunlight

3269.019 --> 3275.0089999999996
and who knows maybe even moonlight let's

3272.2 --> 3275.009
see what happens

3292.12 --> 3298.1099999999997
yeah anyway I have to ponder upon this

3295.15 --> 3298.11
some longer

3314.88 --> 3319.02
how does that really work

3323.1 --> 3330.24
no PJ I'm not gonna but talk about your

3326.619 --> 3330.2400000000002
freakin cloud patterns

3338.54 --> 3343.72
hmm hey Adam II can

3346.52 --> 3352.63
okay sounds good what is that

3376.44 --> 3387.56
hmm yeah sounds pretty good looks good

3380.72 --> 3387.56
14 minutes video from dr. John Dee

3395.2 --> 3404.66
all right anyway I'm gonna round out the

3398.989 --> 3411.4990000000003
show cuz subjects for now and yeah also

3404.66 --> 3414.41
need some lunch so thanks everyone for

3411.499 --> 3417.319
coming and it's been interesting several

3414.41 --> 3423.859
subjects thanks a lot for the input from

3417.319 --> 3425.599
chat Ben yeah it was good mmm they

3423.859 --> 3429.71
apparently know flatter debates oh

3425.599 --> 3437.21
there's a there's a rerun so maybe see

3429.71 --> 3438.7690000000002
using in the chat of that sometime yeah

3437.21 --> 3440.569
if you liked the video then please don't

3438.769 --> 3442.16
forget to upload it and if you haven't

3440.569 --> 3443.569
already subscribed to my channel hit the

3442.16 --> 3445.759
bell notification so you know when and

3443.569 --> 3449.269
well in life which is normally 2 p.m.

3445.759 --> 3451.309
after damn time also please yeah

3449.269 --> 3454.8799999999997
support my channel through the super

3451.309 --> 3455.799
chats paypal patreon and my GoFundMe it

3454.88 --> 3458.71
really does help

3455.799 --> 3463.7889999999998
although yeah it doesn't always help me

3458.71 --> 3465.739
provide subject Oh if a huge file then I

3463.789 --> 3471.279
would just be doing a lot of things and

3465.739 --> 3471.279
presenting that what audio what's audio

3472.42 --> 3481.069
something wrong with my audio no anyway

3479.509 --> 3484.729
I will be back tomorrow with flattered

3481.069 --> 3489.349
the early bird number 274 I hope to see

3484.729 --> 3491.239
most of you then and hashtag me if I

3489.349 --> 3496.989
indeed over macaw

3491.239 --> 3496.989
until the next time yeah keep it flat

3497.55 --> 3517.6800000000003
