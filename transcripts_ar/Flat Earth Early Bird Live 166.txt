7.97 --> 42.989
[Music]

39.35 --> 46.86
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

42.989 --> 50.01
early-bird number 166 I'm your host

46.86 --> 52.079
Arwen and before we start please share

50.01 --> 53.37
the show and subscribe to my channel if

52.079 --> 55.05
you haven't already and hit the bell

53.37 --> 57.419999999999995
notification so you know when I'm going

55.05 --> 60.649
life which they happens to be a little

57.42 --> 64.44
bit early because they've got impatient

60.649 --> 76.89
but on average 2 o'clock p.m. Amsterdam

64.44 --> 78.99
time so yes today's weather yeah it's

76.89 --> 86.369
kind of the same yesterday it's did we

78.99 --> 92.13
need bit cloudy not super warm it still

86.369 --> 95.97
feels like spring it's been a just tiny

92.13 --> 100.47
little bits of rain throughout the night

95.97 --> 110.52
and yesterday evening well that's how it

100.47 --> 115.47
doing ok ok so

110.52 --> 123.479
good morning I am clean

115.47 --> 130.59
Steve brand M Samus Jamison Cormack good

123.479 --> 135.3
to see you all chat early arrivals how's

130.59 --> 141.83
the weather over there there's been a

135.3 --> 141.83
lot of interesting streams happening

144.17 --> 153.14999999999998
let's see I was just watching Owen

147.57 --> 156.209
Benjamin and of course and the Rammstein

153.15 --> 159.39000000000001
video Steve posted in chat at the

156.209 --> 162.41
beginning and was interesting I haven't

159.39 --> 162.41
really kept track of them

165.49 --> 178.77
I have seen Rammstein live a couple of

170.14 --> 178.76999999999998
times though I think like a decade ago

180.73 --> 189.37
yeah so let's see what did I watch oh

183.91 --> 191.56
yeah Randy was on Jose's channel up

189.37 --> 193.0
against the whole panel a rumpus mostly

191.56 --> 199.26
and it was a really interesting

193.0 --> 201.989
conversation so if you haven't seen that

199.26 --> 207.67
definitely go and watch it

201.989 --> 210.01
it he married it on Randy's channel so

207.67 --> 212.349
let me just put up the link so you can

210.01 --> 218.38
watch it later it's really interesting

212.349 --> 223.709
it's just it 18 minutes a little less

218.38 --> 225.76
than 90 minutes long it was good and

223.709 --> 229.18
subscribe to your auntie if you haven't

225.76 --> 230.67999999999998
already he's putting in a lot of effort

229.18 --> 243.519
probably more than he should

230.68 --> 252.81
oh I completely missed out on the ayran

243.519 --> 252.81
round media video too bad

254.67 --> 264.59999999999997
I think oh yeah I was watching some more

258.829 --> 267.63
what's the name some more if the Netflix

264.6 --> 274.40000000000003
series let's see

267.63 --> 278.61
once again yeah oh yeah stranger things

274.4 --> 286.04999999999995
it's pretty interesting I'm now into the

278.61 --> 289.32
second season I don't know I think that

286.05 --> 293.19
the D&D thing it is almost getting kind

289.32 --> 295.71
of all to me because they're very

293.19 --> 298.08
superficial they look the thing about

295.71 --> 300.12
Dean years is that so many different

298.08 --> 302.01
things in it happened so many different

300.12 --> 305.52
monsters with so many different legends

302.01 --> 309.419
and they just keep on referencing just a

305.52 --> 314.76
few things there are very basic players

309.419 --> 320.76
they they play D&D like I used to play

314.76 --> 323.13
when I was like between 14 and 17 and we

320.76 --> 325.68
were just screwing around not really

323.13 --> 328.90999999999997
doing anything serious being overly

325.68 --> 331.41
eager overly ambitious overly greedy

328.91 --> 333.90000000000003
totally out of control as players and

331.41 --> 336.63000000000005
the game would usually just crash after

333.9 --> 338.7
four hours or something or we would good

336.63 --> 344.88
we would get stuck in statistics just

338.7 --> 346.68
looking over tables of possibilities but

344.88 --> 351.33
they're pretty basic players and it's

346.68 --> 352.89
kind of lame they're very young I don't

351.33 --> 360.81
know how young they're even supposed to

352.89 --> 367.919
be anyway stranger things yeah it's

360.81 --> 370.35
still interesting I really like the the

367.919 --> 375.2
other dimension concept it's funny how

370.35 --> 375.20000000000005
they kind of physicalized it

376.889 --> 385.209
it does feel very much like inter planar

380.169 --> 387.269
D&D and and there are the portals it's

385.209 --> 393.069
very I don't know it's very atmospheric

387.269 --> 396.779
it's interesting and yeah mix up with

393.069 --> 396.779
all the kids stuff it's kind of weird

396.929 --> 402.80899999999997
but overall an interesting setting so

409.47 --> 418.11
all right okay the casual spaceman

412.56 --> 419.61
is asking a really good question it's

418.11 --> 422.40000000000003
not that hard to answer

419.61 --> 424.38
he asks our when can you explain in

422.4 --> 428.28
detail how pressure gradient works on a

424.38 --> 433.32
closed dome system Flat Earth model okay

428.28 --> 438.96
well first off there is yeah there's

433.32 --> 441.21
only there are several concepts and the

438.96 --> 445.53
model is not the real thing but if

441.21 --> 450.57
you're gonna presume in disk with a with

445.53 --> 452.15999999999997
a dome on it like a snow globe okay how

450.57 --> 455.37
does the pressure gradient on that work

452.16 --> 457.38000000000005
it's not that difficult at all in fact I

455.37 --> 462.02
think that even mark sergeant mentioned

457.38 --> 464.37
how that worked in his discussion with

462.02 --> 466.5
with the astrophysicists where Mark

464.37 --> 469.98
Sargeant very boldly basically claimed

466.5 --> 471.72
and I like that it's kind of like the

469.98 --> 474.03000000000003
way I would have said it when I was

471.72 --> 478.25
still defending gravity basically says

474.03 --> 480.29999999999995
look gravity does exist it's just it's

478.25 --> 484.23
Universal in its direction it's just

480.3 --> 486.75
down down to the disk and if you have

484.23 --> 488.66900000000004
that if you presuppose that there is

486.75 --> 493.8
some kind of mysterious force or

488.669 --> 496.02
apparent force present then yeah the gas

493.8 --> 501.93
within the container will start to

496.02 --> 504.47999999999996
divide itself and yeah according to

501.93 --> 507.419
their density and that is funny because

504.48 --> 511.11
the relative density theory then

507.419 --> 514.53
suddenly rears its head and that is

511.11 --> 517.08
provable so gravity it's all a matter of

514.53 --> 519.51
perspective really do you want to

517.08 --> 522.12
presuppose it or do you bypass it

519.51 --> 528.42
completely into the territory of

522.12 --> 531.9
relative density so pressure gradient it

528.42 --> 534.81
forms naturally after the equilibrium

531.9 --> 538.23
within the container has been found for

534.81 --> 541.9499999999999
all the gas pressure within and on

538.23 --> 543.03
gradients can form if forces or apparent

541.95 --> 548.13
forces apply

543.03 --> 551.81
or one could say it naturally forms due

548.13 --> 556.53
to the gradient of the relative density

551.81 --> 558.15
spectrum again it's all a matter of

556.53 --> 560.27
perspective so I hope that answers the

558.15 --> 560.27
question

561.62 --> 566.57
stop putting words in my mouth

563.85 --> 566.57
thank you very much

574.38 --> 585.33
I did not say gravity exists I say you

577.5 --> 588.11
can presuppose it you you can build on

585.33 --> 591.36
the presupposition that there is a force

588.11 --> 594.1800000000001
even though only an apparent force seems

591.36 --> 594.78
to be present or could be deduced to be

594.18 --> 597.9
present

594.78 --> 601.26
that's the aberration the aberrations

597.9 --> 605.97
are real it's just not what it seems to

601.26 --> 609.5699999999999
be but you can entertain gravity for

605.97 --> 612.5400000000001
conversations sake doesn't mean that it

609.57 --> 617.84
is a real thing the way it is

612.54 --> 617.8399999999999
presupposed so

633.53 --> 636.16
what

640.71 --> 650.4000000000001
alrights once a 1984 that's fear very

645.5 --> 652.44
very funny so the Greeks proved the

650.4 --> 653.3299999999999
earth was a sphere thousands of years

652.44 --> 658.62
ago

653.33 --> 662.57
then tell me please how how did they

658.62 --> 662.57
manipulate their independent variable

663.14 --> 668.43
because I'm sure that the Greeks started

666.39 --> 671.58
out presupposing that the earth was a

668.43 --> 675.75
sphere in there and their calculations

671.58 --> 677.94
and their modeling sure the degrees

675.75 --> 681.77
could have started it doesn't mean that

677.94 --> 681.7700000000001
they proved it scientifically

691.98 --> 701.46
I know PJ I don't pay a lot of attention

699.33 --> 705.36
to your questions because they're really

701.46 --> 707.7900000000001
annoying not because of something that

705.36 --> 712.59
was said on the debate yesterday and I

707.79 --> 715.98
wasn't really even present because the

712.59 --> 720.38
room was full only slipped in at the

715.98 --> 720.38
last moment in the after show I think

725.85 --> 729.83
[Music]

735.79 --> 739.01
[Music]

746.22 --> 749.58
[Music]

757.32 --> 760.4290000000001
[Music]

769.44 --> 776.95
okay language quality is visibly

772.9 --> 779.02
degrading in my chat please get back

776.95 --> 785.76
soon to some real questions please and

779.02 --> 785.76
not just acting like retards in my chat

793.36 --> 796.48
[Music]

814.94 --> 821.07
good

817.11 --> 824.84
okay interesting theory psychics warrior

821.07 --> 824.84
about the ley lines

832.23 --> 839.71
I'd be very curious to hear how you

835.3 --> 842.529
think that the leylines supposed to work

839.71 --> 845.5600000000001
out in some kind of model that's the

842.529 --> 848.98
first time I've heard anyone talk about

845.56 --> 851.05
it or maybe vaguely reference it if

848.98 --> 855.16
somebody referenced it before a long

851.05 --> 856.4799999999999
time ago if you actually have a a model

855.16 --> 858.79
for the leylines

856.48 --> 865.899
on the flat earth I'd be interested to

858.79 --> 868.8389999999999
see that because I do know about ley

865.899 --> 873.97
lines even way before flat earth that it

868.839 --> 877.12
is a thing apparently also it's weird

873.97 --> 881.47
because I think I can't even feel it but

877.12 --> 884.26
I'm not sure depends I think I have

881.47 --> 886.86
experienced that being at ley lines like

884.26 --> 889.86
for example during dawn feels very

886.86 --> 889.86
intense

905.58 --> 908.58
right

916.56 --> 919.6999999999999
[Music]

924.63 --> 930.72
all right okay well the casual spaceman

928.44 --> 936.3000000000001
let's continue the question since you're

930.72 --> 938.85
keeping it technically correct okay if

936.3 --> 941.7299999999999
you're gonna presuppose a force is

938.85 --> 943.35
present then that force is going to

941.73 --> 946.519
exert pressure and that's gonna

943.35 --> 949.589
basically cause a buoyancy effect as

946.519 --> 952.86
they say according to the gravity

949.589 --> 959.1
structure reasoning that'll push the

952.86 --> 960.75
lighter particles up in relation to the

959.1 --> 964.0790000000001
heavier particles and that is how the

960.75 --> 969.38
gradient would form or you can explain

964.079 --> 974.9399999999999
it by relative density gradient spectrum

969.38 --> 977.54
either way so it's not that difficult

974.94 --> 977.5400000000001
really

987.89 --> 990.98
[Music]

999.069 --> 1007.389
right okay the the altimeter that works

1006.369 --> 1013.509
on the aircraft

1007.389 --> 1015.699
I could I could think of a way that it

1013.509 --> 1018.399
could function I do not literally know

1015.699 --> 1020.189
how it function haven't read into it but

1018.399 --> 1023.439
I could imagine that it is indeed

1020.189 --> 1028.649
pressure based because the gradient is

1023.439 --> 1032.86
pretty consistent so should be able to

1028.649 --> 1036.6689999999999
measure the heights by the typical

1032.86 --> 1039.039
pressure surrounding the aircraft at

1036.669 --> 1041.019
that height because it's been well

1039.039 --> 1043.419
established all the different pressures

1041.019 --> 1046.509
the pressure gradient has been yeah

1043.419 --> 1047.98
mapped out and maybe there's another

1046.509 --> 1051.309
factor at play as well and it's just

1047.98 --> 1055.57
cross reference combined data I don't

1051.309 --> 1057.75
know but I don't see a problem here at

1055.57 --> 1057.75
all

1075.25 --> 1087.7
no I rigged or we Naoko Womble pictures

1080.45 --> 1087.7
of the eyes as taken from earth I I

1088.63 --> 1093.5900000000001
don't know I've heard about that concept

1091.82 --> 1096.62
that they're supposedly something

1093.59 --> 1098.99
visible identified as the ISS I've

1096.62 --> 1101.8
personally never seen it with my own

1098.99 --> 1107.36
eyes or like life through an actual

1101.8 --> 1111.6499999999999
telescope and I have my severe doubts

1107.36 --> 1113.6
about it that it's really real or not

1111.65 --> 1115.0
some kind of weird light trickery or I

1113.6 --> 1119.1789999999999
don't know what that is

1115.0 --> 1121.91
I'd have to see it for myself

1119.179 --> 1125.14
and not just some video plucked off

1121.91 --> 1125.14
youtube somewhere

1144.63 --> 1151.5
we annoying troll

1157.91 --> 1165.1100000000001
all right okay well the casual spaceman

1161.21 --> 1169.6000000000001
if you're gonna presume the aircraft is

1165.11 --> 1172.49
even capable of getting near the dome

1169.6 --> 1175.55
then you're stepping it a little bit too

1172.49 --> 1181.25
far in my opinion because the aircraft

1175.55 --> 1186.1299999999999
needs lift needs to be able to lift in

1181.25 --> 1188.72
the lower pressure in the thinner air or

1186.13 --> 1191.5700000000002
the type of gas that is present really

1188.72 --> 1193.43
high up near the dome if you're gonna

1191.57 --> 1197.74
assume that there is a dome or some kind

1193.43 --> 1197.74
of platform it could never reach there

1199.03 --> 1206.03
you know if airplanes go up too high

1201.97 --> 1209.59
they start to just lose lift and they

1206.03 --> 1214.33
then slow down and it can risk dropping

1209.59 --> 1214.33
like a like a brick

1227.2 --> 1231.77
so the altimeter is just going to

1229.76 --> 1233.39
respond to the pressure whatever fresh

1231.77 --> 1236.12
is surrounding it but they're never

1233.39 --> 1243.3200000000002
gonna reach the edge of the dome with

1236.12 --> 1251.33
any aircraft okay and rockets don't do

1243.32 --> 1254.3
it either unless you want to show me

1251.33 --> 1262.01
that footage of that rocket that crashes

1254.3 --> 1264.559
into the dome or bounces off it or

1262.01 --> 1266.179
something because I don't think that

1264.559 --> 1268.25
Rockets can reach it either I think

1266.179 --> 1271.5700000000002
planes can absolutely not reach it but

1268.25 --> 1271.57
rockets can't either

1280.899 --> 1286.309
all right well casual spaceman if you're

1284.33 --> 1293.33
going to assume that there is a dome

1286.309 --> 1295.639
literally stretching to the edges well

1293.33 --> 1297.32
if it's gonna be to the side it's still

1295.639 --> 1298.9989999999998
going to be subjected to the higher

1297.32 --> 1303.049
pressure because the pressure is purely

1298.999 --> 1305.089
a it's not like in between the dome and

1303.049 --> 1309.95
the earth it's literally specific set

1305.089 --> 1311.809
directions so the dome in the middle

1309.95 --> 1313.969
part you would say that would have

1311.809 --> 1318.379
considerable amount of extremely low

1313.969 --> 1321.499
pressure right next to it but the dome

1318.379 --> 1325.07
parts next to the edge the on the Arctic

1321.499 --> 1326.749
edge that it would be a dome up until

1325.07 --> 1329.7189999999998
the bottom so it's just gonna have

1326.749 --> 1334.579
regular air pressure I don't see the

1329.719 --> 1337.339
issue here what what's your what's the

1334.579 --> 1342.829
real question isn't it obvious all these

1337.339 --> 1345.2
things oh my god no Simon Dan I do not

1342.829 --> 1347.289
have evidence for a dominant claim one

1345.2 --> 1349.909
this guy here is asking questions

1347.289 --> 1351.769
forcing me to presuppose the dome he's

1349.909 --> 1356.259
asking dumb questions

1351.769 --> 1359.119
I don't agree with the dome okay i

1356.259 --> 1361.509
presuppose a looping qualifying that's

1359.119 --> 1361.509
what I do

1368.16 --> 1371.16
goodbye

1384.24 --> 1387.14
anymore

1410.94 --> 1413.94
yeah

1427.52 --> 1430.7
hello Jose

1453.79 --> 1456.42
Wow

1456.61 --> 1465.4599999999998
really Simon then you don't debate

1459.039 --> 1469.149
flat-earthers at all so you pretty much

1465.46 --> 1473.7
figured out that there's no way you can

1469.149 --> 1478.7399999999998
come out of that in one piece right

1473.7 --> 1478.74
because you have terrible skills and

1481.049 --> 1484.899
you're you're on the side where you

1483.279 --> 1487.57
don't have a lot of winning arguments

1484.899 --> 1491.139
it's just the bluff so I get it no

1487.57 --> 1494.529
debate I get it it's a pretty decent

1491.139 --> 1496.12
move it is embarrassing though it's kind

1494.529 --> 1501.659
of as embarrassing as slick James

1496.12 --> 1501.6589999999999
Johnson or five-o as I like to call him

1504.659 --> 1511.2600000000002
Fievel in the snake pit

1516.789 --> 1526.36
let's see if I can yeah I made a funny

1520.22 --> 1529.58
picture or I made I cut out a picture I

1526.36 --> 1532.8799999999999
was just looking at Slick James I can

1529.58 --> 1537.49
and thought he kind of reminds me of

1532.88 --> 1542.179
somebody that weird had and everything

1537.49 --> 1543.799
so and I thought yeah I did call him a

1542.179 --> 1548.89
mouse before because he was calling us a

1543.799 --> 1553.82
snake so I found an appropriate image

1548.89 --> 1563.3700000000001
kind of corresponds to slick James I'll

1553.82 --> 1570.8
present it right now all right

1563.37 --> 1573.6299999999999
so you see the similarities just put a

1570.8 --> 1576.83
like a mobile in front of his mouth and

1573.63 --> 1576.8300000000002
it's slick James

1592.11 --> 1601.1
so yep and inspiration hits you when you

1598.32 --> 1601.1
least expected

1606.55 --> 1613.1499999999999
it's a little mouse with a big mouth and

1608.98 --> 1616.27
very little wisdom it's perfect I don't

1613.15 --> 1621.39
know how much of a driver he is but he

1616.27 --> 1621.3899999999999
completely fits the profile of Fievel

1625.35 --> 1630.76
really random you think

1627.88 --> 1634.72
Fievel is cute I thought it was one of

1630.76 --> 1637.23
the most annoying characters a Disney

1634.72 --> 1640.1200000000001
ever probably created

1637.23 --> 1644.28
well no no that's not true

1640.12 --> 1647.8
you know but one of the most annoying

1644.28 --> 1649.69
main characters it's very hard Disney is

1647.8 --> 1652.27
very good at making extremely annoying

1649.69 --> 1656.38
characters at times but this is like the

1652.27 --> 1658.6
prime this is the main character and I

1656.38 --> 1666.22
find him excruciatingly ly annoying and

1658.6 --> 1667.35
whiny anyway I thought it was very

1666.22 --> 1670.47
fitting

1667.35 --> 1670.4699999999998
[Applause]

1690.12 --> 1702.1399999999999
ah casual spaceman I did not say say

1696.169 --> 1702.14
Rockets were hitting the down I said

1704.84 --> 1711.99
it's probably not possible but yeah who

1710.46 --> 1714.809
knows if you're gonna presuppose a

1711.99 --> 1718.049
literal dome around the disk up until

1714.809 --> 1721.59
bottom floor somehow then yeah of course

1718.049 --> 1726.679
it could hit the dome more to the side

1721.59 --> 1726.6789999999999
at the Antarctic the Antarctic

1736.0 --> 1739.069
[Applause]

1742.72 --> 1745.92
[Music]

1756.47 --> 1760.19
or okay plain truth I don't know I

1758.51 --> 1767.0
wasn't the first one at Disney film

1760.19 --> 1769.1200000000001
though father goes west is the second

1767.0 --> 1769.12
one

1769.21 --> 1775.25
the first one is an American tale I

1771.83 --> 1780.25
think it was Disney and maybe I'm wrong

1775.25 --> 1780.25
I don't know I need to check my facts

1785.06 --> 1788.1599999999999
[Music]

1794.47 --> 1797.47
1986

1800.95 --> 1809.22
no no no it's not who is this

1810.69 --> 1817.95
[Music]

1813.059 --> 1824.039
dumb Bluth okay no it's not Disney it's

1817.95 --> 1825.3300000000002
it's a Hollywood cartoon guy alright

1824.039 --> 1831.36
okay sorry

1825.33 --> 1835.74
Disney accusations oh well it's all kind

1831.36 --> 1837.7199999999998
of the same type of crowd Warner

1835.74 --> 1848.22
Brothers right right

1837.72 --> 1850.5
a Saiyan Lord okay anyway yeah I take it

1848.22 --> 1854.07
back it's not one of Disney's most

1850.5 --> 1856.83
annoying characters it's just I guess a

1854.07 --> 1861.47
very annoying character in general for a

1856.83 --> 1865.34
cartoon anyway

1861.47 --> 1865.34
tastes differ I guess

1869.09 --> 1874.04
[Music]

1870.8 --> 1876.9199999999998
I guess you know when I was a little kid

1874.04 --> 1879.05
I did really like the character but as

1876.92 --> 1882.91
soon as I pretty much became a teenager

1879.05 --> 1882.9099999999999
it just annoyed the hell out of me

1888.91 --> 1897.2
okay drunken bullet I'll be the judge if

1892.91 --> 1899.75
you have a good question ask away oh and

1897.2 --> 1902.0800000000002
hello by the way the enemy can good

1899.75 --> 1902.08
afternoon

1943.1 --> 1949.86
mmm-hmm all right well drunken bullet

1946.379 --> 1954.119
yeah you run straight line and that's

1949.86 --> 1955.4699999999998
according to disk model theory right

1954.119 --> 1957.509
yeah if you go in a straight line

1955.47 --> 1961.289
eventually you'll run into the ice wall

1957.509 --> 1962.8990000000001
it's really nice well yeah you could end

1961.289 --> 1965.129
up at the same point if you

1962.899 --> 1967.619
geometrically go exactly in this

1965.129 --> 1972.509
straight line and not just based on

1967.619 --> 1977.6689999999999
celestial orientation well yeah you

1972.509 --> 1979.71
could presume a radius oh we went in a

1977.669 --> 1982.6490000000001
circle I'm gonna presume I literally

1979.71 --> 1985.799
went in a circle over a sphere yeah you

1982.649 --> 1991.32
can do that or it could simply be

1985.799 --> 1992.759
looping it could be ending up in a

1991.32 --> 1995.22
straight line in the same direction

1992.759 --> 2000.44
because of the nature of the design of

1995.22 --> 2006.559
the realm so yeah if you want to presume

2000.44 --> 2008.1190000000001
a sphere when you end up at the same

2006.559 --> 2011.509
point you started when going in a

2008.119 --> 2013.1899999999998
straight line well you can do that but

2011.509 --> 2015.289
you don't have any proof for it that way

2013.19 --> 2017.48
you're just presupposing it again

2015.289 --> 2019.609
because there's much more to it than

2017.48 --> 2021.769
just moving in a straight line and

2019.609 --> 2025.239
ending up in the same place it's just

2021.769 --> 2025.239
one piece of data

2029.66 --> 2032.8290000000002
[Music]

2035.54 --> 2041.98
okay Jose antipodal what are you talking

2039.8 --> 2041.98
about

2059.19 --> 2062.329
[Music]

2077.349 --> 2082.69
right okay well it's a really nice if

2080.979 --> 2083.859
you're gonna presume this fear and

2082.69 --> 2085.899
everything but there's still no

2083.859 --> 2092.549
curvature and there's still optics to

2085.899 --> 2092.549
account for it's a come D

2099.86 --> 2109.33
it wasn't called an F point value right

2103.96 --> 2109.33
formerly known as the diffraction limit

2110.32 --> 2117.34
all these things in optics that

2112.72 --> 2124.31
definitely do not support obstruction or

2117.34 --> 2126.7400000000002
concealment as curvature in visuals and

2124.31 --> 2128.57
of course presuppose mathematically and

2126.74 --> 2132.5299999999997
geometrically whatever you like in your

2128.57 --> 2136.03
models and but in the actual observable

2132.53 --> 2140.26
world there's other factors at play

2136.03 --> 2146.02
there does not seem to be any curvature

2140.26 --> 2153.7400000000002
so yeah even traveling does not prove

2146.02 --> 2157.06
any geometrical shape at that may prove

2153.74 --> 2157.06
a realm layout

2172.24 --> 2178.1389999999997
[Music]

2203.74 --> 2206.9399999999996
[Music]

2217.78 --> 2224.6800000000003
well thanks for the advice LEP but I

2221.78 --> 2227.9
don't see any need to kick him just yet

2224.68 --> 2231.14
as long as he behaves properly they

2227.9 --> 2233.6600000000003
wants to make a funny observation though

2231.14 --> 2237.6189999999997
and that is every time I see him in chat

2233.66 --> 2240.23
with his icon just makes me think like

2237.619 --> 2244.52
he's a bit of an airhead because his

2240.23 --> 2246.29
head and that looks like a balloon with

2244.52 --> 2249.73
yeah balloons tend to have blown up

2246.29 --> 2252.2
balloons that have very low density so I

2249.73 --> 2258.77
wonder if the low density in his head

2252.2 --> 2261.6699999999996
and making him makes him fly up with his

2258.77 --> 2265.57
imagination as a metaphor I don't know

2261.67 --> 2265.57
just inspired I guess

2265.78 --> 2270.94
hello dot studio 68 good to see you

2275.09 --> 2278.26
[Music]

2287.57 --> 2303.79
a ranty flat earth good to see you

2313.66 --> 2321.7889999999998
Oh Reno Cabo

2318.009 --> 2324.97
yeah to be fair yeah bully cats does

2321.789 --> 2328.8390000000004
look more like a balloon like the actual

2324.97 --> 2332.8289999999997
guy but I was talking specifically about

2328.839 --> 2335.2889999999998
Simon dance icon the the caricature of

2332.829 --> 2336.849
himself just just looks like his head is

2335.289 --> 2339.21
a balloon so I thought it was very

2336.849 --> 2339.21
appropriate

2359.6 --> 2373.22
hey anyway yeah I am open for panel

2366.47 --> 2377.27
members by the way still have over 40

2373.22 --> 2379.22
minutes to go at least tomorrow's gonna

2377.27 --> 2382.25
be an open panel day by the way of

2379.22 --> 2385.04
course as usual but yeah you know what

2382.25 --> 2389.38
I'll just throw out the an out link in

2385.04 --> 2393.59
public let's see maybe Randy and Ally

2389.38 --> 2394.61
the studio wants to join maybe if

2393.59 --> 2397.13
they're in here

2394.61 --> 2401.98
Simon dan may actually dare to get on I

2397.13 --> 2401.98
kind of doubt it though but who knows

2414.34 --> 2423.489
[Music]

2428.579 --> 2431.2690000000002
Hey

2433.12 --> 2438.97
yes Jose I saw Randy's performance on

2436.9 --> 2441.1600000000003
your show against rumpus and brenda and

2438.97 --> 2444.33
he did great it was a very good

2441.16 --> 2447.04
conversation didn't even get really

2444.33 --> 2450.67
screamy or anything it's no really

2447.04 --> 2456.22
pissed and rumpus was typically rumpus

2450.67 --> 2458.64
but I've seen him worse and was really

2456.22 --> 2458.64
enjoyable

2460.29 --> 2470.04
yes I'm and then I I know you're alright

2464.49 --> 2470.04
scaredy-cat now you're not a cat

2475.6 --> 2482.35
I know the thought of getting into an

2480.37 --> 2489.39
actual debate with a flat earther gets

2482.35 --> 2489.39
you on a ceiling cuz you're a balloon so

2491.43 --> 2500.3799999999997
as soon as the flat earther comes it's

2493.9 --> 2505.26
just that icon is just tries to stay out

2500.38 --> 2505.26
of sight I get it

2512.67 --> 2524.369
hmm well good for you is one say a 90-84

2517.38 --> 2526.4100000000003
be sure to hit my super jet if you

2524.369 --> 2529.829
appreciate me for the entertainment

2526.41 --> 2533.45

2559.24 --> 2567.91
complete statement is that supposed to

2561.31 --> 2570.06
be funny I was just joking around come

2567.91 --> 2570.06
on

2571.53 --> 2577.6800000000003
I'm not even bashing you for the

2574.42 --> 2582.57
legitimate criticism I have about your

2577.68 --> 2582.5699999999997
poor overall personality come on

2591.9 --> 2594.859
all right

2598.31 --> 2610.02
hey Ali B hey how are you doing me oh

2612.66 --> 2616.56

2614.64 --> 2618.45
on minute I'm just gonna be a coffee I'm

2616.56 --> 2621.74
just gonna do it I just thought about

2618.45 --> 2625.1699999999996
telling you I don't want coffee as well

2621.74 --> 2627.2999999999997
okay what if you stay here talking maybe

2625.17 --> 2629.79
you start talking to Simon down in chat

2627.3 --> 2631.17
and I'm gonna make coffee then when I

2629.79 --> 2634.2599999999998
get back you make coffee

2631.17 --> 2636.44
what'd he say oh yes no problems yeah

2634.26 --> 2640.0200000000004
that's a deal

2636.44 --> 2645.98
okay all right Simon

2640.02 --> 2649.17
dan why don't you come on and talk and

2645.98 --> 2651.95
discuss things where they're very same

2649.17 --> 2656.2200000000003
people that you insult and hide behind

2651.95 --> 2662.52
yellow YouTube channel I think it's

2656.22 --> 2670.23
kinda as kind of cowardly kinda exposes

2662.52 --> 2672.99
our a personality flaw and the way that

2670.23 --> 2675.27
yeah it's like I could imagine you in

2672.99 --> 2677.7299999999996
real life you know it says a lot about

2675.27 --> 2679.34
someone you know you make these videos

2677.73 --> 2681.54
and so in people that are asking

2679.34 --> 2683.28
equations are I'm just wondering if you

2681.54 --> 2687.5
that's what you actually if you're a

2683.28 --> 2691.86
teacher do you teach your you teach kids

2687.5 --> 2695.67
that that if anybody thinks different

2691.86 --> 2699.6
than their own idea I'm just wondering

2695.67 --> 2702.57
and you fly under the flag you're just

2699.6 --> 2704.85
pointing arrows they will know your no

2702.57 --> 2707.88
you're not you're insulting people and

2704.85 --> 2709.44
if you think and and and actually it

2707.88 --> 2711.7200000000003
shows them internally you know the

2709.44 --> 2717.18
people that actually follow you that

2711.72 --> 2720.6
actually condone your behavior because

2717.18 --> 2723.0899999999997
it's it's it's kind of shallow that the

2720.6 --> 2725.16
only the only way that you can get

2723.09 --> 2728.9100000000003
recognition

2725.16 --> 2731.49
by bringing other people they down you

2728.91 --> 2732.66
know when we look at it on a beggar and

2731.49 --> 2735.83
the beggar picture

2732.66 --> 2740.21
yeah your YouTube channel is

2735.83 --> 2744.96
specifically to attack people and

2740.21 --> 2747.9900000000002
encourage a brilliant of people that are

2744.96 --> 2752.91
online trying to have a discussion about

2747.99 --> 2756.5099999999998
stuff and you and the people late you

2752.91 --> 2757.47
have coming uninvited we don't want you

2756.51 --> 2760.0200000000004
we don't need you

2757.47 --> 2762.56
that's why to the modern al that's why I

2760.02 --> 2766.68
would say that a cat clothes like this

2762.56 --> 2768.87
we always bring in viewers it gives a

2766.68 --> 2771.3599999999997
[ __ ] why would you want employing people

2768.87 --> 2773.4
of this team mentality is that person

2771.36 --> 2776.3700000000003
and here a chat

2773.4 --> 2778.26
we are the in and if people just want

2776.37 --> 2781.5
you to discuss things fight with you

2778.26 --> 2784.17
bring in the toxicity of the band divine

2781.5 --> 2787.41
energy energies and stuff like that

2784.17 --> 2789.78
because that's what you're doing by by

2787.41 --> 2792.3599999999997
even interacting with these these people

2789.78 --> 2795.48
when they leave ur are coming don't

2792.36 --> 2797.7000000000003

2819.6 --> 2830.12

2823.44 --> 2833.84
hook with some pleasure oh all right so

2830.12 --> 2833.8399999999997
I'm taking over

2836.65 --> 2846.4300000000003
yeah coffee is nice and I really need

2840.049 --> 2851.499
some yesterday I was in a weird mood

2846.43 --> 2854.779
and I was I got some beers last minute

2851.499 --> 2857.1189999999997
and then I did something very unusual

2854.779 --> 2859.849
for my doing and I'm kind of regretting

2857.119 --> 2863.449
it but I guess it's like a test but I

2859.849 --> 2864.739
actually got non-organic food I craved

2863.449 --> 2870.739
french fries

2864.739 --> 2874.309
I've been bicycling past this specific

2870.739 --> 2878.119
place several times and yeah when I met

2874.309 --> 2879.739
up with with Hagrid wells we went in

2878.119 --> 2883.099
there because he had to get some dinner

2879.739 --> 2886.4
and they have really good French fries I

2883.099 --> 2889.549
kind of stole a couple from Hagrid wells

2886.4 --> 2891.38
he had got a lot of stuff and now I've

2889.549 --> 2893.449
been craving it and I got some of that

2891.38 --> 2897.049
and I got my own mayonnaise or at least

2893.449 --> 2900.949
I didn't get non-organic fats like only

2897.049 --> 2905.599
the French fries but yeah it was nice

2900.949 --> 2908.329
but even as I was stuffing myself with

2905.599 --> 2911.029
it eventually started feeling like

2908.329 --> 2915.619
there's something off about this and now

2911.029 --> 2916.699
today I woke up almost like nauseated

2915.619 --> 2919.6400000000003
it's freaky

2916.699 --> 2921.739
it really matters so much apparently it

2919.64 --> 2925.239
was a big test usually I like take a

2921.739 --> 2927.979
french fry maybe or you know like

2925.239 --> 2931.309
getting seduced but I never eat like a

2927.979 --> 2933.14
whole bag of french fries like like I

2931.309 --> 2938.6890000000003
did yesterday and man I do definitely

2933.14 --> 2941.089
feel that and good to have a actual

2938.689 --> 2945.469
physical reminder again why I eat

2941.089 --> 2952.42
organic and why I don't get seduced to

2945.469 --> 2955.099
do this kind of stuff a lot so mmm

2952.42 --> 2958.13
yeah it made quite an impact like I

2955.099 --> 2960.829
still feel it in my guts this it's weird

2958.13 --> 2964.4
because normally sometimes I like overdo

2960.829 --> 2966.8590000000004
the alcohol or something when I like

2964.4 --> 2968.859
feel really bad or I'm about to get sick

2966.859 --> 2970.359
and I suddenly overdo the alcohol and

2968.859 --> 2973.359
everything and then the next day I can

2970.359 --> 2977.109
get like really nauseated for a while

2973.359 --> 2979.299
but then it goes away eventually I could

2977.109 --> 2982.269
drink enough water get some stuff and it

2979.299 --> 2984.249
goes away but with this it's not really

2982.269 --> 2986.589
going away so I got a strong feeling

2984.249 --> 2991.6299999999997
this is gonna hang around like pretty

2986.589 --> 2992.2
much until the until the late evening so

2991.63 --> 2996.539
yeah

2992.2 --> 3003.089
regular french fries it's worse than

2996.539 --> 3007.6800000000003
every drugs for Arwen I would live

3003.089 --> 3008.19
without is that fly elf french fries are

3007.68 --> 3011.3999999999996
warm

3008.19 --> 3015.15
no it was a regular snack bar as they

3011.4 --> 3018.059
call it with the punch with a chinese

3015.15 --> 3019.589
couple I think like a lot of snack bars

3018.059 --> 3022.0190000000002
here in the Netherlands are filled up

3019.589 --> 3024.269
with with Chinese families they all

3022.019 --> 3025.89
claim it apparently because it's really

3024.269 --> 3028.549
low paying and they don't give a [ __ ]

3025.89 --> 3032.249
and they just put their family to work

3028.549 --> 3034.14
so yes you see here I would sit here a

3032.249 --> 3039.48
lot of those some Vietnamese I think

3034.14 --> 3042.089
Vietnamese and like Syrians and and

3039.48 --> 3044.039
stuff like that they usually do no half

3042.089 --> 3046.799
bar because I know they have the ground

3044.039 --> 3049.739
balls and strike well they have combined

3046.799 --> 3052.14
things here so they provide like snack

3049.739 --> 3056.609
bar typical what Dutch people like but

3052.14 --> 3061.109
also sometimes Chinese food they make it

3056.609 --> 3063.769
separately so they're quite well planned

3061.109 --> 3067.2889999999998
and ambitious I get the feeling but

3063.769 --> 3069.749
they're not all about oh I only want to

3067.289 --> 3072.69
hype they really they're aiming to build

3069.749 --> 3075.45
a business really seriously and are

3072.69 --> 3077.4
willing to take to work very hard for

3075.45 --> 3080.249
relatively little money as long as they

3077.4 --> 3083.009
get the coroner as it were I don't know

3080.249 --> 3084.6299999999997
I kind of in fact you do yeah but you do

3083.009 --> 3087.66
real they are hard workers and that's

3084.63 --> 3090.21
what of this year but he's people skull

3087.66 --> 3093.1499999999996
and we we trying to have a Pakistanis we

3090.21 --> 3095.91
call ashore a [ __ ] Shore right and I was

3093.15 --> 3098.009
in about but I was never like derogative

3095.91 --> 3100.6189999999997
before because Scottish people were very

3098.009 --> 3101.33
least worth our language so we shortened

3100.619 --> 3103.46
what

3101.33 --> 3106.13
you know I mean so it was never I was

3103.46 --> 3109.7
never brought up when I see how I'm good

3106.13 --> 3111.7400000000002
then the pakis that means that saves in

3109.7 --> 3114.77
all I'm going down in the Pakistani Shah

3111.74 --> 3116.54
so we we never use another talk about

3114.77 --> 3119.33
racism I love Anu of Avery I never

3116.54 --> 3121.64
became invalid Collins racist Stella

3119.33 --> 3125.0
went down in London and that was like a

3121.64 --> 3127.3399999999997
25 year old Armand was my ever first

3125.0 --> 3130.37
experience on about the hill recess and

3127.34 --> 3134.6600000000003
was my no and and I actually began to

3130.37 --> 3137.6
feel that because I because I left in

3134.66 --> 3141.3799999999997
London and it's really really real trait

3137.6 --> 3144.5899999999997
it's like a you actually see silt and

3141.38 --> 3148.04
behavior and you actually become like

3144.59 --> 3150.77
that and I know that I'm not the harm no

3148.04 --> 3153.68
but the thoughts will in my head about a

3150.77 --> 3156.62
black people never Muslims I've got got

3153.68 --> 3160.0699999999997
friends and that but like there would

3156.62 --> 3161.66
you call it the generalization I got a

3160.07 --> 3163.94
generalization came out and I started

3161.66 --> 3164.8399999999997
feeling it myself and that was just

3163.94 --> 3167.93
because of the hell because then

3164.84 --> 3170.9
Scotland went on as I can't you know I

3167.93 --> 3172.7599999999998
don't I was never taught to he anybody

3170.9 --> 3176.03
of a different race my thought my family

3172.76 --> 3179.3
and we never got taught that there's

3176.03 --> 3182.36
really realtor it suddenly become it can

3179.3 --> 3184.7000000000003
become a social habit to do that but

3182.36 --> 3187.13
exactly that's what happened to me it

3184.7 --> 3189.74
became like a not that was really real

3187.13 --> 3192.02
you know when I think about it they I

3189.74 --> 3195.95
can actually remember like my whole

3192.02 --> 3198.56
mentality towards a black people I came

3195.95 --> 3200.4199999999996
generalized you know and I had to fight

3198.56 --> 3203.2999999999997
against that because I was a we love it

3200.42 --> 3206.2400000000002
but I fought against the thoughts in my

3203.3 --> 3210.2000000000003
head king of them you know and right now

3206.24 --> 3211.8199999999997
I know I know what you mean but I got

3210.2 --> 3214.5499999999997
something to add to that and that is

3211.82 --> 3215.3900000000003
look I've had similar things from a

3214.55 --> 3217.8500000000004
different angle

3215.39 --> 3219.91
it's basically derived from fear of what

3217.85 --> 3224.36
you don't know and what is different and

3219.91 --> 3228.0499999999997
I had it myself but I realized that and

3224.36 --> 3230.28
this is even it's a step beyond liberal

3228.05 --> 3234.27
because

3230.28 --> 3237.03
yeah you can realize like okay it's not

3234.27 --> 3239.55
all that overgeneralization there are

3237.03 --> 3241.92
good people and then you could like a

3239.55 --> 3244.71
typical liberal just ignore all the bad

3241.92 --> 3247.38
and to see the good in it or you could

3244.71 --> 3252.12
say no there is a group of people that

3247.38 --> 3255.27
fit that profile exactly and they are

3252.12 --> 3256.98
often even racist themselves towards

3255.27 --> 3260.88
other groups and they're just generally

3256.98 --> 3263.67
bigoted terrible people and they exist

3260.88 --> 3266.52
and those are yeah it's almost like okay

3263.67 --> 3268.38
you can be racist against those only the

3266.52 --> 3272.52
problem is anyone seeing that will never

3268.38 --> 3274.2000000000003
get it they were always wrong but

3272.52 --> 3276.39
there's definitely a group of people

3274.2 --> 3278.8199999999997
that absolutely don't fit that bill and

3276.39 --> 3281.6099999999997
it's just like if you would make a

3278.82 --> 3283.9500000000003
remark of that type to that person it's

3281.61 --> 3285.78
just completely off it just doesn't make

3283.95 --> 3287.0699999999997
any sense because their frequency is

3285.78 --> 3291.57
completely different there you're

3287.07 --> 3296.1000000000004
addressing another culture it's like the

3291.57 --> 3300.27
mistake that Bush made calling what was

3296.1 --> 3302.2799999999997
it again the the Sunnis the enemies are

3300.27 --> 3304.71
a terrible problem against the Shiites

3302.28 --> 3307.4100000000003
while he was addressing with the Sunnis

3304.71 --> 3309.78
like you only didn't do it's like that

3307.41 --> 3313.98
it's totally off if you don't that if

3309.78 --> 3318.48
you're being overgeneralizing racist to

3313.98 --> 3324.18
somebody that's just a really yeah well

3318.48 --> 3328.34
adapted fully realized person of another

3324.18 --> 3330.9199999999996
race exactly the other member of that a

3328.34 --> 3334.4700000000003
what you call a member of that group

3330.92 --> 3336.87
just by consequence so both kind of like

3334.47 --> 3338.6099999999997
you know the law yeah if you you know I

3336.87 --> 3340.56
mean know that yeah exactly exactly and

3338.61 --> 3342.57
and the thing was I was going to talk

3340.56 --> 3344.2799999999997
about is that I hate it when it comes

3342.57 --> 3347.55
and you know when these thoughts and you

3344.28 --> 3350.7900000000004
vide and invade you know like what I say

3347.55 --> 3352.53
what you disclaim deal is yeah yeah

3350.79 --> 3354.3
you're looking at that person it's not

3352.53 --> 3356.3100000000004
even partly group making the same color

3354.3 --> 3358.53
or they're they may have the same belief

3356.31 --> 3360.93
a football fan or whatever right but

3358.53 --> 3363.27
you're judging in Mozilla and a key and

3360.93 --> 3363.8399999999997
then AMA the thing is I'm a we off when

3363.27 --> 3365.94
info

3363.84 --> 3367.38
come into my head mm-hmm and I get

3365.94 --> 3369.09
pissed off with it you know I mean oh

3367.38 --> 3371.7000000000003
god damn but you're right you have to

3369.09 --> 3375.09
there's a balance is it not you know

3371.7 --> 3376.8599999999997
loathing thoughts and but yeah it's

3375.09 --> 3380.2200000000003
great it's quite difficult you know

3376.86 --> 3383.01
thinking actually but you gotta say it

3380.22 --> 3386.31
in a way like this as well is that these

3383.01 --> 3388.8300000000004
groups have their troublemakers like we

3386.31 --> 3391.11
have our troublemakers that we still see

3388.83 --> 3392.91
as part of our group the but that are

3391.11 --> 3393.6600000000003
constantly getting in our way and making

3392.91 --> 3398.7
us look bad

3393.66 --> 3400.68
and the the racial groups you could call

3398.7 --> 3403.56
it or their type of communities however

3400.68 --> 3408.24
that started to form have the same

3403.56 --> 3411.98
problems so if people are let me give

3408.24 --> 3415.9199999999996
you a very punishing example but if like

3411.98 --> 3419.46
Pete Shay was B flat earther in every

3415.92 --> 3422.01
one side yeah of course if we would be

3419.46 --> 3424.77
all declared completely nuts and all

3422.01 --> 3427.7700000000004
that sorry PJ sorry there are nothing

3424.77 --> 3429.93
solid they would they would have proof

3427.77 --> 3435.6
over it would say well look here's

3429.93 --> 3438.8999999999996
perfectly with your evidence right but

3435.6 --> 3441.39
the thing is every group has this type

3438.9 --> 3443.9700000000003
of issue every social group every

3441.39 --> 3446.8199999999997
community group however it may

3443.97 --> 3448.95
crystallize so it can be about opinions

3446.82 --> 3452.6400000000003
about the subject it could be a religion

3448.95 --> 3456.2999999999997
it could be a typical natural racial

3452.64 --> 3460.2
community and the subcultures from those

3456.3 --> 3463.92
races that come with that and they all

3460.2 --> 3465.54
have their idiots that are kind of

3463.92 --> 3469.4900000000002
accepted but are constantly making

3465.54 --> 3471.98
trouble for them for them as a community

3469.49 --> 3474.5099999999998
facing the rest of the world and

3471.98 --> 3479.4900000000002
sometimes it grows completely out of

3474.51 --> 3482.63
control somewhere as well so I think

3479.49 --> 3485.85
that's all the good thing about that is

3482.63 --> 3487.77
there's a well I'm just kinda realizing

3485.85 --> 3490.2
they know well especially last night

3487.77 --> 3491.279
yesterday was an amazing day for me yo

3490.2 --> 3494.609
and you know you have one

3491.279 --> 3496.739
these the Euro flaked back or another

3494.609 --> 3498.959
the color the color but was owing lastly

3496.739 --> 3500.819
you who were on the beer last night or

3498.959 --> 3503.969
has to be something in the atmosphere

3500.819 --> 3505.89
cuz I never usually drank I thought I'm

3503.969 --> 3508.679
gonna have a ball awaiting saw a giant

3505.89 --> 3511.8289999999997
actually drank two bottles honestly but

3508.679 --> 3514.89
the last it came now we are talking

3511.829 --> 3516.7490000000003
about things that like normal people

3514.89 --> 3518.5789999999997
don't you know in the daily life don't

3516.749 --> 3522.089
talk about we just be discussing

3518.579 --> 3524.4590000000003
psychology group dynamics all this kind

3522.089 --> 3526.459
of stuff people do people discuss those

3524.459 --> 3528.8999999999996
things these things in real life

3526.459 --> 3532.4089999999997
anything which knowledge that we talk

3528.9 --> 3534.839
nope yeah exactly and I think you well

3532.409 --> 3536.849
though I do I just do it I viewed your

3534.839 --> 3539.699
badges well I've seen no one's really

3536.849 --> 3541.319
funny because sometimes really

3539.699 --> 3542.4
interesting situations come out of it

3541.319 --> 3545.009
because there are some people that

3542.4 --> 3547.7690000000002
totally don't expect it but they'll just

3545.009 --> 3549.839
be polite and kind of not rudely walk

3547.769 --> 3551.1589999999997
away but they totally don't get what

3549.839 --> 3553.019
you're saying and they've kind of

3551.159 --> 3556.9790000000003
learned to act like to go along with it

3553.019 --> 3559.1989999999996
and you can totally abuse that but in a

3556.979 --> 3564.419
good way I always stood in a good way

3559.199 --> 3566.609
that you actually I guess it's kind of

3564.419 --> 3568.3489999999997
wizardry in a way but I love that

3566.609 --> 3571.769
sometimes it really works

3568.349 --> 3574.409
and you can just hand them like chunks

3571.769 --> 3576.689
of information that they're really

3574.409 --> 3579.15
uncomfortable with but you can still

3576.689 --> 3582.239
make it visible to them and they'll just

3579.15 --> 3584.699
try to forget about it but it's a good

3582.239 --> 3587.219
chance they'll might dream about it or

3584.699 --> 3590.009
something yeah exactly it's a you know

3587.219 --> 3592.169
what I'm not rude and obviously about an

3590.009 --> 3594.839
hour ago I was talking to machine

3592.169 --> 3596.39
we're just discussing of a Irani well

3594.839 --> 3599.249
talked just discussing a few things

3596.39 --> 3602.069
exactly they were always seen as you

3599.249 --> 3605.3689999999997
just repeated elevate what it's what

3602.069 --> 3609.199
wasn't you do and it's about its social

3605.369 --> 3612.059
it's about social interaction trickery

3609.199 --> 3614.099
using the mechanisms that are present

3612.059 --> 3616.219
typically and also realizing that there

3614.099 --> 3621.719
are mechanisms in the first place

3616.219 --> 3624.69
ah-ha-ha exactly no the problem is that

3621.719 --> 3627.06
those only elect

3624.69 --> 3629.609
but probably in the millions that

3627.06 --> 3631.77
northern so when the interact they

3629.609 --> 3634.319
basically use that generalization of

3631.77 --> 3636.93
psychology you know effect most people

3634.319 --> 3639.24
okay so our war I think there's a whole

3636.93 --> 3642.27
swath of people that do know about this

3639.24 --> 3644.64
like say listen no sales we all know

3642.27 --> 3647.579
about this and there's a lot of salesmen

3644.64 --> 3650.8489999999997
in the world well exactly they get told

3647.579 --> 3654.27
on the actually an a marketer Anil and

3650.849 --> 3656.9100000000003
they get traded polymer yeah and but the

3654.27 --> 3659.369
thing is right but to the normal layman

3656.91 --> 3660.93
the crane driver the calf until the

3659.369 --> 3663.27
plumber and stuff like that

3660.93 --> 3666.359
cracking don't know but they don't

3663.27 --> 3669.359
contemplate the implications over that

3666.359 --> 3671.88
they could actually be subjected to it

3669.359 --> 3673.47
because you know what you know that yet

3671.88 --> 3676.9100000000003
yeah you're a wheel then you can start

3673.47 --> 3678.99
noticing that when people do it to you

3676.91 --> 3681.24
if you know I mean you know if someone's

3678.99 --> 3685.29
trying it peer that's mean our I

3681.24 --> 3689.7299999999996
guarantee you you sport I think more

3685.29 --> 3692.579
lately than maybe a normal person it's

3689.73 --> 3696.2400000000002
when someone's using what wizardry or

3692.579 --> 3697.65
something that tactic or ammonia okay

3696.24 --> 3701.31
nothing you're aware of that because

3697.65 --> 3703.7400000000002
immediately yes exactly and exactly why

3701.31 --> 3707.04
they're doing it even I'm kind of dude I

3703.74 --> 3709.89
can totally like it's almost Star Trek

3707.04 --> 3712.38
in like oh we're being tractor beam yeah

3709.89 --> 3714.7799999999997
send them a pulse feedback into this

3712.38 --> 3717.27
that's literally what I do when people

3714.78 --> 3718.5600000000004
try to trick me I immediately like what

3717.27 --> 3721.5
is it what is it they're doing why are

3718.56 --> 3725.16
they doing it what is driving them okay

3721.5 --> 3727.26
counter response way yeah more arsenal

3725.16 --> 3729.93
eyes way more personalized counter

3727.26 --> 3732.42
response because it happens and I'm not

3729.93 --> 3735.54
just a steady mechanism response yep

3732.42 --> 3739.56
yeah what you've just explained it takes

3735.54 --> 3741.27
about 0.8 into analyze what something

3739.56 --> 3743.5499999999997
position it's like you'll have that

3741.27 --> 3746.91
conversation in your head but it's like

3743.55 --> 3750.1800000000003
if it's a switch yeah your instinct just

3746.91 --> 3752.16
grabs hold and analyzes within

3750.18 --> 3753.6299999999997
milliseconds and you've analyzed you

3752.16 --> 3757.3489999999997
know exactly what they are doing blah

3753.63 --> 3758.15
blah blah blah and you react like and I

3757.349 --> 3760.59
second

3758.15 --> 3762.48
that's quite a reason the brain actually

3760.59 --> 3766.65
when you when I sleep pretty don't ask

3762.48 --> 3769.11
with early on the biggest problem with

3766.65 --> 3771.96
me with that mechanism is not

3769.11 --> 3774.0
immediately wanting to talk because then

3771.96 --> 3775.92
I tend to talk over people and a lot of

3774.0 --> 3777.96
people have this issue that are dealing

3775.92 --> 3779.55
with this type of analytical mechanism

3777.96 --> 3781.44
and everybody starts talking over one

3779.55 --> 3784.65
another and automatically because you're

3781.44 --> 3787.26
so in tune and it's the biggest trick to

3784.65 --> 3789.9
basically do that whole it to yourself

3787.26 --> 3791.9100000000003
and then wait until the still adapt to

3789.9 --> 3794.88
the tempo of the conversation as to not

3791.91 --> 3796.5
disrupt the flow of the line of thinking

3794.88 --> 3800.07
of the person you're talking with that's

3796.5 --> 3803.16
a big important trick to do and I don't

3800.07 --> 3806.76
always get it right especially like on

3803.16 --> 3808.77
Nathan's but yeah that I ever did

3806.76 --> 3810.1800000000003
different approach it just I'm a dog in

3808.77 --> 3812.88
the corner on a chain and suddenly I

3810.18 --> 3816.21
just jump out and parent yeah that's

3812.88 --> 3818.01
what I do there if I'm the same mother

3816.21 --> 3820.11
yeah but it's not but the fact that

3818.01 --> 3823.2000000000003
you're aware of it I will meet you

3820.11 --> 3825.36
you're a it gives you an advantage when

3823.2 --> 3827.5499999999997
you know it because that's my problem as

3825.36 --> 3830.4300000000003
well about interrupting I'm just

3827.55 --> 3832.7400000000002
beginning LM a you know maybe they'll

3830.43 --> 3834.7799999999997
isolate you're improving me your what

3832.74 --> 3836.6099999999997
you said I've noticed that as I see cuz

3834.78 --> 3838.71
I remember leave when you actually saved

3836.61 --> 3841.59
right I'm working on myself

3838.71 --> 3843.7200000000003
mm-hm and six months ago and it's true

3841.59 --> 3846.27
oh you're doing a lot better you still

3843.72 --> 3848.37
have your moments when you're kind of

3846.27 --> 3849.9
like nervous or something and then you

3848.37 --> 3852.9
become very impulsive and it's

3849.9 --> 3854.82
unstoppable you might end up angry but

3852.9 --> 3857.34
yeah I have kind of the same thing as

3854.82 --> 3860.9700000000003
well and in periods but yeah you used to

3857.34 --> 3863.28
constantly be very breaky in your

3860.97 --> 3865.02
interaction you like didn't know to find

3863.28 --> 3865.98
the right timing now you know it you

3865.02 --> 3869.73
know how it works

3865.98 --> 3872.13
you're your conversationalist now you're

3869.73 --> 3875.01
doing alright so I you have to progress

3872.13 --> 3877.11
in your skill absolutely well this is a

3875.01 --> 3880.7400000000002
thing you know the frustrating thing

3877.11 --> 3883.38
about us is that I've known all along

3880.74 --> 3886.4399999999996
right because I know all these you know

3883.38 --> 3888.7200000000003
these like in you know when all not all

3886.44 --> 3891.2400000000002
about but I have a very deep

3888.72 --> 3891.8999999999996
understanding of really psychology and

3891.24 --> 3894.359
stuff like that

3891.9 --> 3896.88
and the thing is the thing is um I'm

3894.359 --> 3898.92
committing the crime whilst on OA and

3896.88 --> 3900.4500000000003
that was what was the most frustrating

3898.92 --> 3902.4300000000003
thing youngest that you know you know

3900.45 --> 3904.71
you're doing stop

3902.43 --> 3906.72
but sometimes right you can't stop the

3904.71 --> 3909.4990000000003
impulse you just recognized what happens

3906.72 --> 3913.2
well it has to start somewhere and

3909.499 --> 3915.6189999999997
eventually as you allow yourself to just

3913.2 --> 3918.39
look it in the face and not escape it

3915.619 --> 3920.73
eventually you'll be able to see the

3918.39 --> 3924.839
forefronts and you feel it coming you

3920.73 --> 3926.849
feel potentially minutes in advance like

3924.839 --> 3929.16
oh I feel it's going this way I'm gonna

3926.849 --> 3932.2200000000003
probably do this now what do I do to

3929.16 --> 3936.089
avoid that and you adapt your tactics

3932.22 --> 3938.97
beforehand instinctive a look at its

3936.089 --> 3942.69
management it is real it is Personnel

3938.97 --> 3946.859
Management with you it's nice enough to

3942.69 --> 3949.17
do that yeah exactly exactly and it's

3946.859 --> 3950.96
just exactly what you say it's like

3949.17 --> 3953.46
you've seen it in the future because

3950.96 --> 3956.19
because you're reading your reaction lit

3953.46 --> 3958.41
coming to what you know are with what

3956.19 --> 3960.18
you know that guy's going to see so you

3958.41 --> 3961.529
know that man again starts talking you

3960.18 --> 3962.8489999999997
know exactly where these go and so

3961.529 --> 3966.059
you're not actually seen inand the

3962.849 --> 3967.739
future so it's right you know it's

3966.059 --> 3969.5690000000004
exactly disclaims you've got anger and

3967.739 --> 3972.18
you know what a minute before is that

3969.569 --> 3974.369
you can feel it you can feel it in your

3972.18 --> 3977.069
toes then it's game you know where it's

3974.369 --> 3978.7490000000003
going that's literally how it said

3977.069 --> 3980.97
colloquy you know where it's going

3978.749 --> 3984.7099999999996
because you recognize it because people

3980.97 --> 3987.359
don't really invent new things or

3984.71 --> 3989.46
concepts every single time they talk

3987.359 --> 3991.049
it's very rare that a person out of

3989.46 --> 3992.9700000000003
nowhere start something new

3991.049 --> 3995.97
most of what people talk about is

3992.97 --> 4000.0789999999997
regurgitation or a perfection of a

3995.97 --> 4001.5789999999997
certain point so it's very likely if

4000.079 --> 4003.529
you're going to hear somebody say

4001.579 --> 4005.509
something it's gonna be something you

4003.529 --> 4009.829
recognize unless you're like totally

4005.509 --> 4012.98
fresh to the scene yeah yeah exactly

4009.829 --> 4016.4500000000003
exactly and that's exactly right

4012.98 --> 4018.799
Arvind you know that's not something a

4016.45 --> 4021.319
people I'm not I'm not saying people who

4018.799 --> 4024.42
issued what calm example it's funny not

4021.319 --> 4028.609
because generally you have

4024.42 --> 4031.38
it's easier to to teach them to practice

4028.609 --> 4033.839
you know because emotions it's crazy you

4031.38 --> 4036.839
know s and and it came that if you doing

4033.839 --> 4038.73
if you don't lead by example

4036.839 --> 4041.67
nobody's going to take you seriously

4038.73 --> 4043.89
nothing mm-hmm you know I still like

4041.67 --> 4046.89
that but I don't think it's a thing that

4043.89 --> 4048.359
should be a quashed there's a time and a

4046.89 --> 4052.46
place for it and it's just recognizing

4048.359 --> 4054.72
that time that to hell with her I'm

4052.46 --> 4056.309
emotional and I'm going to spit it out

4054.72 --> 4058.019
I deserve to you know it's like that

4056.309 --> 4059.88
finding that you know there's a time and

4058.019 --> 4061.9199999999996
a place to do it you know what it's not

4059.88 --> 4067.17
bad you know they got to find the right

4061.92 --> 4069.15
moment that's exactly and so for sale

4067.17 --> 4072.029
but I would have I would put a challenge

4069.15 --> 4074.25
to Simon damn um I would like to

4072.029 --> 4079.559
challenge him coming to be coming to be

4114.089 --> 4119.759
need some time to do it but come on with

4116.37 --> 4122.0689999999995
me come on they're actually that gang

4119.759 --> 4124.38
hides behind the channel right he's

4122.069 --> 4126.179
slang savory but the off but never

4124.38 --> 4128.069
interacts you understand they're nothing

4126.179 --> 4130.35
that chemically and that's why I was

4128.069 --> 4131.759
I've seen in the modern eels look good

4130.35 --> 4133.1900000000005
and tonight to these people don't

4131.759 --> 4138.569
encourage them

4133.19 --> 4143.58
it's not for me EC but if it was late so

4138.569 --> 4144.839000000001
I would even hope our Darwin sorry

4143.58 --> 4145.859
what's a gang we are a hundred or

4144.839 --> 4148.35
thousand soaps

4145.859 --> 4149.13
coming to this channel and what is he

4148.35 --> 4150.6900000000005
doing here

4149.13 --> 4152.819
you understand he's not here because

4150.69 --> 4156.239
he's here for a reason or hes doing song

4152.819 --> 4158.01
get rid of them stop interacting with

4156.239 --> 4159.66
these we should stop him tonight

4158.01 --> 4162.75
these people but unfortunately we need

4159.66 --> 4165.3
these people to interact with tell em

4162.75 --> 4166.83
more ourselves you know if we see

4165.3 --> 4168.96
something oh you're wrong because I just

4166.83 --> 4172.38
thought we could look at how are you

4168.96 --> 4176.43
it's over he's he's free hostile

4172.38 --> 4179.61
advertisement I have no problem with it

4176.43 --> 4181.71
as long as he just doesn't go period his

4179.61 --> 4182.16
Eagle look why would you want if feed is

4181.71 --> 4183.63
evil

4182.16 --> 4186.36
to hell with it I mean thank God it's

4183.63 --> 4188.43
like 50 really good new subscribers

4186.36 --> 4190.799999999999
actual people that are in chats and are

4188.43 --> 4195.87
actually interacting with me from him so

4190.8 --> 4198.4800000000005
thank you for that Simon then see he's

4195.87 --> 4200.49
not all figure he's not just a UH but

4198.48 --> 4202.799999999999
Alvin your man oh you've got 50 more

4200.49 --> 4204.8099999999995
subs if it not just subs please small

4202.8 --> 4207.150000000001
other he's all that I gots to learn I

4204.81 --> 4209.79
got to listen in truth I got to know new

4207.15 --> 4214.379999999999
people that are actually good and nice

4209.79 --> 4216.66
and interest interested so and I got a

4214.38 --> 4218.97
wave of trolls at first especially but

4216.66 --> 4220.83
they've here okay they leave right look

4218.97 --> 4223.740000000001
look let me let me explain something to

4220.83 --> 4225.6
y'all win right see and this is a fact

4223.74 --> 4228.179999999999
because it happened to me like you're

4225.6 --> 4231.870000000001
not and I thought when I used to go on a

4228.18 --> 4234.450000000001
hunt about 33 subscribers right and then

4231.87 --> 4237.48
I went on a dales ensure that a year ago

4234.45 --> 4240.03
whatever I was born in reg a regular on

4237.48 --> 4242.9
Neil my sub K Jasmine burst it

4240.03 --> 4246.83
I mean intellectually went up Tilly in

4242.9 --> 4249.96
200 subscribers not for a [ __ ] and

4246.83 --> 4252.12
slacking Don a Camus thought because I

4249.96 --> 4254.22
wasn't interested in his songs of his I

4252.12 --> 4257.73
was actually I was actually getting

4254.22 --> 4261.45
worried I had so many some scribbles but

4257.73 --> 4263.129999999999
I learned something almond as that the

4261.45 --> 4265.29
more hangouts you want to you don't need

4263.13 --> 4267.72
claims like there Simon down and people

4265.29 --> 4270.66
coming to you what you do this is you

4267.72 --> 4273.030000000001
got the more you interact on a hangouts

4270.66 --> 4276.24
and stuff like that you get subscribers

4273.03 --> 4278.58
that way and that's much more honest we

4276.24 --> 4280.2
then doing it rather than we don't need

4278.58 --> 4282.0
these people to come to your child you

4280.2 --> 4285.63
don't need them but I'm not gonna throw

4282.0 --> 4287.85
away free subscribers yeah but I'm

4285.63 --> 4289.95
saying you're putting your Putin you're

4287.85 --> 4292.31
putting too much onus on having

4289.95 --> 4295.17
subscribe us

4292.31 --> 4297.72
people meeting new people is important

4295.17 --> 4300.93
right I mean I'm explaining it wrongly

4297.72 --> 4304.41
oh the explained I'm right so what I'm

4300.93 --> 4308.01
seeing is the more hangouts that you go

4304.41 --> 4310.98
on to the more subscribers so you don't

4308.01 --> 4312.24
have to rely on Simon dance and stuff

4310.98 --> 4314.759999999999
like that you'll get more subscribers

4312.24 --> 4317.46
good oh I am NOT

4314.76 --> 4320.63
I find this weird you're suggesting I'm

4317.46 --> 4322.56
relying upon it no I don't ever say well

4320.63 --> 4324.51
that's not the way I meant it that

4322.56 --> 4326.580000000001
you're relying on I never said that not

4324.51 --> 4328.83
as long as you literally use the word

4326.58 --> 4332.04
though may have not been what you meant

4328.83 --> 4334.59
but that's what you said and I'm just

4332.04 --> 4336.45
the one hey I told you look I'm not

4334.59 --> 4339.4800000000005
gonna be like Riley and ranty and

4336.45 --> 4340.71
literally all look look at what they did

4339.48 --> 4342.66
now it's all wrong

4340.71 --> 4345.93
I I don't give a much attention I'm

4342.66 --> 4348.2699999999995
actually one of the debater group guys

4345.93 --> 4350.280000000001
that gives them the least attention of

4348.27 --> 4353.1900000000005
anyone but if they're gonna visit me in

4350.28 --> 4355.139999999999
my chats I will not be shy to just

4353.19 --> 4358.259999999999
answer their questions how oh no matter

4355.14 --> 4361.4400000000005
how stupid or repetitive it is as long

4358.26 --> 4364.59
as they're not gonna be disgusting all

4361.44 --> 4366.419999999999
right but well I agree we are not and if

4364.59 --> 4368.46
you're not classy that side ever but

4366.42 --> 4372.24
don't you get that you'll hit the house

4368.46 --> 4374.76
that are implying the a you know I don't

4372.24 --> 4377.25
I said we don't need them I never said

4374.76 --> 4379.4400000000005
you rely on I says we don't need them

4377.25 --> 4381.48
so we'll clear that out straight away so

4379.44 --> 4383.25
you don't think now say that because why

4381.48 --> 4387.0599999999995
are you thinking that I said that we

4383.25 --> 4389.97
will you judge me well and I get your

4387.06 --> 4393.54
point you're totally get it it's good

4389.97 --> 4396.33
point but it is more complicated like do

4393.54 --> 4398.46
we need him like I personally in what I

4396.33 --> 4401.49
do don't need them at all I got plenty

4398.46 --> 4403.74
of material I'm like is anybody finally

4401.49 --> 4408.09
gonna ask a real question is anybody

4403.74 --> 4409.349999999999
gonna try to get on my level first proof

4408.09 --> 4411.3
that they understand what the hell I'm

4409.35 --> 4413.85
actually talking about and then asking

4411.3 --> 4415.59
questions on that level that's really

4413.85 --> 4420.4400000000005
what I'm hoping for I don't need guys

4415.59 --> 4424.96
like him at all at all but as a

4420.44 --> 4427.599999999999
community as a YouTube

4424.96 --> 4430.63
alternative media phenomena flat

4427.6 --> 4433.530000000001
earthers kind of do need these type of

4430.63 --> 4437.38
figures because they rake in new people

4433.53 --> 4441.25
yes yes I don't I don't like leave it

4437.38 --> 4445.39
all the arguments have progressed

4441.25 --> 4448.96
greatly because all these people the

4445.39 --> 4451.6900000000005
same crap that's been going on for the

4448.96 --> 4455.38
last five years is still hot hold on

4451.69 --> 4458.37
it's not the same trap Howard it's all

4455.38 --> 4460.21
the same crap I would it be the same re

4458.37 --> 4461.8
manifestation we talked about having a

4460.21 --> 4463.66
conversation she's my tongue I talk away

4461.8 --> 4466.3
see softly the thing is for the last

4463.66 --> 4468.28
five years that this has been going on

4466.3 --> 4470.26
for five years these people coming in of

4468.28 --> 4473.83
channels and stuff like that it's it's

4470.26 --> 4475.75
the same we are not all slowly but

4473.83 --> 4477.73
surely no one don't is science that I

4475.75 --> 4479.77
was trying to bring in about two years

4477.73 --> 4481.419999999999
ago I was trying but and playing in the

4479.77 --> 4484.21
subject of people actually looking at

4481.42 --> 4485.65
the science a stuff that was the whole

4484.21 --> 4488.32
reason I'm going that's what I was

4485.65 --> 4489.67
trying to do and it got food but now

4488.32 --> 4492.88
after two years

4489.67 --> 4494.86
no faily was talking about this speed

4492.88 --> 4497.9400000000005
the late late the French and stuff like

4494.86 --> 4501.58
when born in a we are actually

4497.94 --> 4503.589999999999
discovering new stuff yeah that we never

4501.58 --> 4505.93
that that we've never known about real

4503.59 --> 4507.7300000000005
actually trading real actually looking

4505.93 --> 4510.700000000001
at new science the science for the stuff

4507.73 --> 4513.28
that real we are the real looking at a

4510.7 --> 4515.49
regarding a fly off right this it's not

4513.28 --> 4519.28
the air looks wrong is deceptively

4515.49 --> 4519.61
engineering a lot of things new from

4519.28 --> 4522.25
scratch

4519.61 --> 4524.2
yeah that's exactly but no no my

4522.25 --> 4525.88
frustration I was amping here five years

4524.2 --> 4527.32
I was near enough in at the beginning I

4525.88 --> 4528.25
was brought me over sex yields I was

4527.32 --> 4532.599999999999
needed nothing that they can have

4528.25 --> 4535.74
remember Nathan they startin is when he

4532.6 --> 4537.79
first started the shoes I remember it

4535.74 --> 4540.099999999999
was it called for China

4537.79 --> 4542.23
it was our China whatever's there is

4540.1 --> 4545.02
pain I remember the pegs split and the

4542.23 --> 4547.23
conspiracies over her yeah yeah and

4545.02 --> 4549.7300000000005
either plane I was the other in

4547.23 --> 4552.16
destruction that that caused it just

4549.73 --> 4554.0199999999995
went Oh totally

4552.16 --> 4557.09
so everybody went off on their own

4554.02 --> 4559.790000000001
famous flying off the pointers

4557.09 --> 4562.91
maybe's frustration to me the point is

4559.79 --> 4565.04
none of you were pretty layer with fly

4562.91 --> 4567.98
offers beginning to understand the

4565.04 --> 4571.79
science more and being able to be across

4567.98 --> 4574.61
arguments and noise notice when someone

4571.79 --> 4576.05
has seen something is totally focusing

4574.61 --> 4579.62
or well no that's not because the

4576.05 --> 4582.320000000001
Rayleigh criteria or perspective demands

4579.62 --> 4586.3099999999995
or gravity the accretion right right

4582.32 --> 4589.67
right but they'll also get there at the

4586.31 --> 4591.200000000001
same time if these people were not there

4589.67 --> 4593.9
to constantly get in her way and

4591.2 --> 4596.0599999999995
challenges and try to trick us that we

4593.9 --> 4599.54
would not have had this level of

4596.06 --> 4601.88
training we would have for thing and

4599.54 --> 4604.25
speculating without being able to really

4601.88 --> 4605.900000000001
test it against a real opponent so we

4604.25 --> 4608.54
need these opponents to progress

4605.9 --> 4610.82
ourselves to sharpen the bat although we

4608.54 --> 4613.97
don't know yes we do

4610.82 --> 4616.099999999999
and we have it we have our oven we need

4613.97 --> 4617.87
to study more we need to be sales well

4616.1 --> 4619.97
we don't need these claims they don't

4617.87 --> 4622.79
help us research yeah they do I do

4619.97 --> 4625.9400000000005
because they drive us they motivate us

4622.79 --> 4628.85
we should need the the but we do we

4625.94 --> 4631.79
shouldn't but review not me personally

4628.85 --> 4635.18
though but the community as a whole yes

4631.79 --> 4638.33
the competition actually drives much of

4635.18 --> 4641.33
it off but if I'm going that is the flaw

4638.33 --> 4644.48
that thank you what that's exposing that

4641.33 --> 4647.54
we as independent thinkers need someone

4644.48 --> 4649.549999999999
to show in ball us and war till them

4647.54 --> 4650.2699999999995
little train why don't we just going to

4649.55 --> 4653.03
put your brain

4650.27 --> 4655.400000000001
let's sparring wait oh no why can't you

4653.03 --> 4658.88
just pick up a book and look for

4655.4 --> 4660.92
ourselves instead of having a subjecting

4658.88 --> 4664.43
ourselves to abuse because you need to

4660.92 --> 4666.9800000000005
feel tests things usually go up against

4664.43 --> 4669.62
some you doesn't agree in order to

4666.98 --> 4672.08
really sharpen your ideas and get it

4669.62 --> 4673.82
right and not start dwelling on your own

4672.08 --> 4676.85
created delusions that are not being

4673.82 --> 4680.509999999999
tested tested really it's really

4676.85 --> 4682.97
necessary it's even science the official

4680.51 --> 4685.79
original science worked like that comes

4682.97 --> 4688.52
philosophy all of it constant conflicts

4685.79 --> 4690.679
because that's what drives it that's

4688.52 --> 4692.75
what drives the development yeah

4690.679 --> 4695.57
it does it's historically prove but it

4692.75 --> 4700.55
doesn't need to be like the oven is the

4695.57 --> 4703.58
point it doesn't need to be why it is it

4700.55 --> 4706.219
is how it works it it is yeah you go

4703.58 --> 4711.38
engine Ola answer Lily well do you agree

4706.219 --> 4714.89
with me it doesn't have to be like you

4711.38 --> 4717.650000000001
can do it other ways but luckily if you

4714.89 --> 4722.0
don't feel tests your thoughts and

4717.65 --> 4724.219
concepts then yeah you're gonna the less

4722.0 --> 4726.199
you feel test your concepts and more you

4724.219 --> 4728.42
theorize and purely on your own the

4726.199 --> 4732.139999999999
harder it becomes to actually get to the

4728.42 --> 4735.83
field testing I've experienced this my

4732.14 --> 4737.89
say up later on Stan training is what

4735.83 --> 4740.48
makes you really good at it

4737.89 --> 4742.55
okay it is Jenna Ward

4740.48 --> 4744.3099999999995
do you know what you did Dale you just

4742.55 --> 4746.659000000001
suddenly rumpus asked you a yes-or-no

4744.31 --> 4749.9890000000005
question and then you went on to explain

4746.659 --> 4752.719
and I still don't know we stand yes or

4749.989 --> 4755.78
no question that was a yes or no

4752.719 --> 4758.449
what was the yes or no question do we

4755.78 --> 4762.639999999999
need not conflict do we need to be

4758.449 --> 4767.719
abused to make us go and look at a bit

4762.64 --> 4770.96
yes or no me personally no right answer

4767.719 --> 4773.6
what does it on the long run yes I do

4770.96 --> 4777.199
it's not an immediate thing but it needs

4773.6 --> 4779.360000000001
to be part of living because that's just

4777.199 --> 4783.0199999999995
how life works it needs to be tested

4779.36 --> 4783.83
ah [ __ ] see that that's just how

4783.02 --> 4785.870000000001
life works

4783.83 --> 4789.0199999999995
yes Lee it's a part of a rope it's a

4785.87 --> 4791.63
paralyzed and like would you even say

4789.02 --> 4795.110000000001
would you accepted that answer right off

4791.63 --> 4798.5
of your parent for example if you said

4795.11 --> 4800.57
why why and they see because I see so

4798.5 --> 4802.4
but that's what that answer was the

4800.57 --> 4805.28
universe not be no it's an egg no it's

4802.4 --> 4806.87
nothing lame of authority no don't red

4805.28 --> 4809.9
herring me Ali I'm getting really pissed

4806.87 --> 4811.34
off here and by the way is what you say

4809.9 --> 4814.67
with your red herring no I'm not

4811.34 --> 4818.33
claiming Authority saying it's there and

4814.67 --> 4821.87
it works it's not an easy that is

4818.33 --> 4823.54
telling you to do anything I've no no no

4821.87 --> 4826.21
I was criticizing you

4823.54 --> 4830.62
acceptance on the court that you said

4826.21 --> 4832.66
well that's the real life as that's why

4830.62 --> 4834.82
I was classy that's not what I said it's

4832.66 --> 4836.68
how it functions it's not this saying

4834.82 --> 4838.719999999999
that's just how it is

4836.68 --> 4841.650000000001
that's not what I'm saying I'm saying

4838.72 --> 4844.87
literally it's a technical part of

4841.65 --> 4847.299999999999
hearts and life that works and develops

4844.87 --> 4849.16
but it doesn't have to that was a

4847.3 --> 4852.400000000001
creation does it have to be like that

4849.16 --> 4854.82
yes yes there you go

4852.4 --> 4858.07
so what you've done there is you've

4854.82 --> 4860.0199999999995
settled you've accepted that that's the

4858.07 --> 4861.5199999999995
way as when it doesn't have to I've got

4860.02 --> 4866.92
proof it doesn't have to be that way

4861.52 --> 4868.96
Armand it's good for you no because it

4866.92 --> 4871.54
precise nice to hear it I'd like to hear

4868.96 --> 4873.52
it like the long stretch of it as in

4871.54 --> 4875.0199999999995
period of 10 years you show me where

4873.52 --> 4879.63
there's no conflict and it's not

4875.02 --> 4881.89
necessary for actual development show me

4879.63 --> 4884.53
okay well we will have a discussion

4881.89 --> 4886.93
about Lanaya the or don't know I'm sure

4884.53 --> 4888.5199999999995
you want because it's very hard like on

4886.93 --> 4890.05
the short rail yeah you don't need

4888.52 --> 4891.820000000001
conflict this is what I answered with

4890.05 --> 4894.64
first you don't need conflict on the

4891.82 --> 4897.25
short run you can just learn but

4894.64 --> 4899.38
eventually you do need to fireproof it

4897.25 --> 4901.48
you do need to test it whatever you're

4899.38 --> 4905.4400000000005
doing it's called field testing even

4901.48 --> 4907.66
science requires empirical engagements

4905.44 --> 4911.259999999999
it's a part of the scientific method for

4907.66 --> 4913.84
crying out loud okay it is required in

4911.26 --> 4917.26
order to progress it's the natural way

4913.84 --> 4920.59
things work concerning the last

4917.26 --> 4923.5
regulation last privation your and there

4920.59 --> 4931.57
are critical parts of that progression

4923.5 --> 4935.32
that are always there that's all it's

4931.57 --> 4937.99
it's like the same thing without evil

4935.32 --> 4940.65
you would not appreciate good it's

4937.99 --> 4942.36
another one of those type of concepts

4940.65 --> 4947.139999999999
bollocks

4942.36 --> 4949.21
nope the eyes ball up smooth no that's

4947.14 --> 4952.18
that's one it if that's it nice a

4949.21 --> 4954.31
materialistic acceptance that's know

4952.18 --> 4956.490000000001
this all has to be evil not just a

4954.31 --> 4959.240000000001
materialist an extractive

4956.49 --> 4961.32
we accept an evil absolutely

4959.24 --> 4964.32
anti-materialistic has nothing to do

4961.32 --> 4966.33
with it it's purely about the spiritual

4964.32 --> 4967.139999999999
balance of things that's where that

4966.33 --> 4971.28
comes from

4967.14 --> 4974.52
no last year one of you are when I'm

4971.28 --> 4977.099999999999
beginning to a nor accept

4974.52 --> 4978.93
well I'm taught oh it's just the we as

4977.1 --> 4981.4800000000005
well that was your seed meal no but

4978.93 --> 4984.360000000001
that's what you're saying I never say

4981.48 --> 4986.099999999999
that I've never said that you constantly

4984.36 --> 4988.65
bring it up like I'm okay with

4986.1 --> 4990.660000000001
everything like just because I know

4988.65 --> 4993.719999999999
something works in a certain way or I

4990.66 --> 4997.11
claim it that that means that of course

4993.72 --> 5000.14
leave it all alone no a person has a a

4997.11 --> 5002.7699999999995
thing to do in the world no matter how

5000.14 --> 5002.77
it works

5003.01 --> 5009.41
certain mechanisms that are like you

5006.14 --> 5011.3
can't take them out doesn't mean that

5009.41 --> 5013.849999999999
you can just be like oh yeah because

5011.3 --> 5016.76
okay without evil we wouldn't appreciate

5013.85 --> 5018.4400000000005
beauty so let's create evil no that's

5016.76 --> 5020.570000000001
totally ridiculous

5018.44 --> 5023.66
it has nothing to do with that that's an

5020.57 --> 5026.24
overgeneralization it's drawing the

5023.66 --> 5029.78
system towards your own personal actions

5026.24 --> 5031.67
in in an attempt to try to justify some

5029.78 --> 5034.82
kind of behavior that's what that is

5031.67 --> 5037.7300000000005
it has nothing to do with how things

5034.82 --> 5040.759999999999
work it's drawing a concept towards

5037.73 --> 5042.919999999999
yourself and then trying to use that to

5040.76 --> 5044.24
intellectually intellectually be able to

5042.92 --> 5047.78
manipulate yourself to do something

5044.24 --> 5049.73
that's just wrong that's not what I'm

5047.78 --> 5053.3
doing I'm just pointing at how things

5049.73 --> 5055.219999999999
work it's like chemistry yeah the last

5053.3 --> 5057.56
four cemeteries date in order for a

5055.22 --> 5059.150000000001
chemical reaction to come into being

5057.56 --> 5062.030000000001
there have to be two different materials

5059.15 --> 5064.5199999999995
at least and they will no longer be as

5062.03 --> 5067.25
they was are they ask you something no

5064.52 --> 5069.620000000001
the oven let's see let me ask actuation

5067.25 --> 5074.84
let me ask a question right so you're

5069.62 --> 5078.14
seeing the evil is a necessity for good

5074.84 --> 5082.1900000000005
to exist that's not what I said

5078.14 --> 5086.12
so what do you see then I said without

5082.19 --> 5088.429999999999
the darkness without evil and this is

5086.12 --> 5090.29
from a consciousness standpoint Beauty

5088.43 --> 5094.12
would not be as

5090.29 --> 5096.59
appreciate it and that's a natural fact

5094.12 --> 5100.46
as you're not dealing with how the

5096.59 --> 5103.22
consciousness functions Louis no yes it

5100.46 --> 5107.17
is and I'm done I'm done with this I'm

5103.22 --> 5111.41
done with this you're being very well

5107.17 --> 5113.18
define if you cannot believe it is

5111.41 --> 5115.46
getting annoying this oppositional

5113.18 --> 5117.71
defines it's not necessary I've talked

5115.46 --> 5120.38
about these subjects many many many many

5117.71 --> 5122.9
times and little in the early bird show

5120.38 --> 5125.92
even with reason with peanuts Clark and

5122.9 --> 5130.79
with all the others it's weird that you

5125.92 --> 5135.35
you don't accept that these things just

5130.79 --> 5138.62
work this way and until you Delhi we can

5135.35 --> 5141.83
literally demonstrate that it's not

5138.62 --> 5143.63
required with an example which you

5141.83 --> 5145.5199999999995
haven't you just said no it's not

5143.63 --> 5148.25
necessary you haven't actually provided

5145.52 --> 5151.7300000000005
an example so it's a belief in that

5148.25 --> 5153.65
sense a feeling it's not necessary but

5151.73 --> 5156.5599999999995
you have to first provide the proof and

5153.65 --> 5157.54
then we'll talk so I'm gonna run out the

5156.56 --> 5160.04
show

5157.54 --> 5162.25
what's interesting thanks everyone for

5160.04 --> 5162.25

5211.1 --> 5216.1
chats and I see Randy getting a lot of

5213.02 --> 5220.540000000001
super chats recently and I totally think

5216.1 --> 5220.54
yeah I heard you say

5222.63 --> 5228.31
I'm not unhappy for them to get it I

5225.75 --> 5232.03
they totally deserve it in my opinion

5228.31 --> 5234.22
but I was just wondering why it has died

5232.03 --> 5236.32
down a little on my side I'm not saying

5234.22 --> 5239.8
like we should give me more money just

5236.32 --> 5243.37
one wondering why it's been been of a

5239.8 --> 5245.9800000000005
vacuum recently but anyway I'm still

5243.37 --> 5248.86
