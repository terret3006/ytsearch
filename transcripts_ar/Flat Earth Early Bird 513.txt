yeah yeah damn ikan yeah good to see you

183.42 --> 200.67
all uh that a pretty late night there's

192.27 --> 202.68
so much going on yesterday I'm still

200.67 --> 205.97
kind of recovering

202.68 --> 213.239
I was so active yesterday was just crazy

205.97 --> 218.07
mm-hmm and man like the the ball-busters

213.239 --> 225.44
lasted so long so long I was really

218.07 --> 225.44
knackered after that Lola is exposed

226.58 --> 233.25
what's happening with the icons for your

229.98 --> 236.39999999999998
membership oh right

233.25 --> 240.18
yep yeah the atom Eakin I think I

236.4 --> 242.79
commented yeah I've been trying to

240.18 --> 245.82
figure out some things like trying out

242.79 --> 248.519
like what type if I couldn't what I like

245.82 --> 252.39
you know based also what you gave me but

248.519 --> 255.45000000000002
it's I don't know I could technically

252.39 --> 261.12
use what you gave me just yet that's

255.45 --> 265.7
barely visible sorry about that I could

261.12 --> 268.44
just use it but I don't know my artistic

265.7 --> 272.37
needs are telling me like no you gotta

268.44 --> 274.74
be more specific with something but this

272.37 --> 278.669
is I don't know I don't know if you can

274.74 --> 280.5
even alter the icons afterward I don't

278.669 --> 283.15999999999997
know much about how it actually works

280.5 --> 283.16
that system

288.27 --> 292.349
but yes Adam ikan most of those icons

290.94 --> 298.62
like three of them were absolutely

292.349 --> 306.389
suitable it's just that like I was

298.62 --> 309.15
thinking like for the yeah I was like

306.389 --> 312.21000000000004
kind of mixed about the arcane Archer in

309.15 --> 314.69899999999996
this year because this year was proper

312.21 --> 317.669
for it but it was so dark you know and

314.699 --> 323.789
seers are not necessarily dark in my

317.669 --> 326.37
opinion especially if they're elven can

323.789 --> 331.349
we see your options again

326.37 --> 333.72
oh that devil that would be very awesome

331.349 --> 337.159
the Adam Macon yeah I would definitely

333.72 --> 337.15900000000005
want to get back to you about it

342.319 --> 348.15000000000003
no Voynich I'm not gonna use my face

345.93 --> 355.38
what the hell's everyone's obsession

348.15 --> 358.409
with me always like why the do I seem

355.38 --> 360.99
like a trump like a guy that just wants

358.409 --> 364.53
to see his freakin face everywhere I may

360.99 --> 367.86
have everyone named after him like do I

364.53 --> 375.33
really seem like that guy's I don't get

367.86 --> 380.72900000000004
this show them criticized on the air and

375.33 --> 385.25
I can alter them okay okay Adam let's

380.729 --> 385.25
see let's get in

385.42 --> 397.12
right some Skype because yeah Adam

393.02 --> 397.12
brought forth some really awesome icons

399.64 --> 407.38
so this is kind of what he brought to

402.92 --> 407.38
the table pretty badass

410.02 --> 414.41999999999996
right

412.69 --> 416.96999999999997
[Music]

414.42 --> 417.6
although I thought the seer icon was a

416.97 --> 420.81
bit dark

417.6 --> 422.58000000000004
you obviously know it's like Dark Wizard

420.81 --> 425.55
with an eye well that's not really what

422.58 --> 430.28999999999996
its ears like and yeah it's funny

425.55 --> 433.17
because you're the the left bottom one

430.29 --> 436.67
is it's funny because I recognize it is

433.17 --> 439.98
kind of an official arcane Archer symbol

436.67 --> 443.1
from certain games in which they use

439.98 --> 444.57
that concept as well so that on itself

443.1 --> 450.18
it would be proper

444.57 --> 452.01
especially referring to D&D and yeah

450.18 --> 458.13
well the druid kind of stands for itself

452.01 --> 459.87
the Arch Druid so yeah I but I could

458.13 --> 463.14
technically just use this

459.87 --> 467.94
I probably not use the the right upper

463.14 --> 473.78
one because it just seems too dark but

467.94 --> 477.63
anyway yeah I thought it was great and I

473.78 --> 484.89
can already use it you know me if I can

477.63 --> 487.38
alter the pictures afterward then I

484.89 --> 493.22999999999996
could just use these and then maybe

487.38 --> 494.61
tweak it a little later which one is my

493.23 --> 497.43
favorite one did that I don't really

494.61 --> 501.16
have a favorite look there's gonna be

497.43 --> 505.01
four different icons for it so

501.16 --> 508.01000000000005
[Music]

505.01 --> 513.4399999999999
I guess that I think the arcane Archer

508.01 --> 515.33
one is really awesome right yeah

513.44 --> 517.72
Marceline that is the arcane our

515.33 --> 517.72
children

518.5 --> 526.308
[Music]

527.49 --> 532.91
right and there is a kind of a gamer

530.4 --> 537.12
based chronological order to it you know

532.91 --> 539.9399999999999
the bottom level will be Ranger it's

537.12 --> 542.0600000000001
just like a basic membership and then

539.94 --> 545.33
you get the arcane Archer so like a

542.06 --> 547.77
little more ability sneaks in there and

545.33 --> 549.6
yeah a little bit more magical with the

547.77 --> 553.89
archery which is probably the base of

549.6 --> 556.5600000000001
most Rangers anyway at least elven

553.89 --> 560.01
ranges you know I guess the Strider I

556.56 --> 563.8699999999999
know is more about the sword and then

560.01 --> 567.84
yeah you get to see it's like the arcane

563.87 --> 572.82
power reaches its peak and then you get

567.84 --> 575.64
to see and then yeah when you see you

572.82 --> 579.12
yeah you ultimate yeah you're either go

575.64 --> 581.16
nuts or you take responsibility and then

579.12 --> 585.41
one could be considered an arc through

581.16 --> 590.48
it in a way it's it's a bit of a jump

585.41 --> 590.48
but I think that most people will get it

591.38 --> 600.75
yes I can same as emotes no no it's just

598.68 --> 604.5799999999999
a little icon that will be showed next

600.75 --> 604.58
to your name if you remember

613.43 --> 629.6899999999999
yes I was mother see I think my audience

620.03 --> 632.6
would be very suitable for that and I'm

629.69 --> 635.36
not going to demand it you know but yeah

632.6 --> 638.51
with the membership system present I

635.36 --> 641.3000000000001
have the interesting option to just

638.51 --> 644.5699999999999
suddenly turn members only on if I want

641.3 --> 648.65
to do and then yeah no trolls could

644.57 --> 652.85
possibly just sneak in and spam or

648.65 --> 656.12
something so it's yeah it's another

652.85 --> 662.78
function I've seen others use it it can

656.12 --> 668.14
be very handy especially if you want to

662.78 --> 668.14
take your check very seriously so yeah

673.15 --> 680.51
and who knows where I'll go you know and

675.56 --> 683.5999999999999
the way I tend to my chat has changed a

680.51 --> 688.31
lot everybody that has been here with me

683.6 --> 690.2900000000001
throughout the year knows it's changed

688.31 --> 692.5699999999999
Lots like developing I figure it out

690.29 --> 694.8499999999999
well that'll probably hit go the same

692.57 --> 697.7600000000001
way with the membership system it's just

694.85 --> 700.73
something I got to figure out how to do

697.76 --> 704.71
it right what's what's the best way to

700.73 --> 704.71
do it as I go

708.88 --> 719.68
good sorry that Cosentino gravitational

714.08 --> 719.6800000000001
lensing really oh dear

722.019 --> 730.399
well it's kind of a big claim isn't it

725.05 --> 732.889
it's a claim that the bending of

730.399 --> 738.049
space-time if it is sufficient enough

732.889 --> 740.629
will also bend light but all such claims

738.049 --> 751.699
like specifically in celestial

740.629 --> 753.879
observations like that's admitted it's

751.699 --> 760.3599999999999
of a science fiction concept it's it's

753.879 --> 762.939
designated to the or is it the region of

760.36 --> 766.279
pseudo science of course the

762.939 --> 769.699
astrophysics well as for physics is like

766.279 --> 772.16
the presupposed physics of the celestial

769.699 --> 773.019
observations so that's where that comes

772.16 --> 776.149
from

773.019 --> 779.589
it's a concept it's been around for a

776.149 --> 779.589
while since Einstein I think

782.59 --> 785.659
[Music]

801.23 --> 805.6700000000001
right yeah that's correct

813.28 --> 824.0799999999999
okay the concept correlates directly to

818.92 --> 825.42
the yet to the metaphysical construct of

824.08 --> 829.0
a black hole

825.42 --> 830.77
remember the a void that sucks up all

829.0 --> 833.92
light while the sucking up of all light

830.77 --> 837.39
is the the bending and the effective non

833.92 --> 837.39
release of light

845.3 --> 850.2199999999999
it is kind of weird though I think that

847.67 --> 854.5699999999999
like the concept of black holes were

850.22 --> 857.6
invented before there was even any kind

854.57 --> 860.45
of observation I think that it really

857.6 --> 862.85
was originally a metaphysical construct

860.45 --> 866.36
that came out of conceptualization

862.85 --> 871.19
reasoning concerning gravity and the

866.36 --> 873.649
universe so I think that that the the

871.19 --> 878.9300000000001
Einstein type of conceptual thinking and

873.649 --> 882.14
modeling I think that purely that doing

878.93 --> 884.6899999999999
that yielded the concept of a black hole

882.14 --> 888.709
and then it became very popular as a

884.69 --> 895.57
concept and that it was absorbed into

888.709 --> 899.0
science fiction and mainstream cosmology

895.57 --> 901.97
and it is a very interesting concept I

899.0 --> 904.73
have to be yeah I have to be fair about

901.97 --> 906.9200000000001
that I've always found the concepts of

904.73 --> 909.2
black holes very fascinating and also

906.92 --> 911.75
like if they're really there what's

909.2 --> 915.76
their real relation what what is their

911.75 --> 919.27
balance with it all and like what is the

915.76 --> 928.149
deeper function as it were in the whole

919.27 --> 928.149
yeah so yep say endless busying therapy

929.589 --> 933.82
okay that's cool man you

947.39 --> 956.87
Oh God Sarita so he's yeah we won't look

952.82 --> 961.839
into it that stuff well I guess then he

956.87 --> 966.41
has a personal issue with it you know I

961.839 --> 968.48
wouldn't accept it at that age even

966.41 --> 971.87
though I conceptually kind of did look

968.48 --> 975.14
into it I just I just looked I didn't

971.87 --> 978.44
really assimilate any technicals about

975.14 --> 982.16
it I just looked listened to the

978.44 --> 985.85
reasoning that I heard at the time take

982.16 --> 988.67
took note that it was kind of sound but

985.85 --> 993.2900000000001
then rejected it after taking note of

988.67 --> 1001.99
that because I yeah it's it's tied into

993.29 --> 1004.079
the the the trust with society if

1001.99 --> 1008.61
there's heavy rejection at a younger age

1004.079 --> 1013.54
it's because of yeah not wanting to deal

1008.61 --> 1017.62
with that Society upholds Ally and that

1013.54 --> 1020.29
you fell for can be very tough for some

1017.62 --> 1024.579
people you know especially in their

1020.29 --> 1027.6399999999999
teams I think but not everyone it's

1024.579 --> 1031.62
really about the individual and like

1027.64 --> 1031.6200000000001
their personal inner struggles

1042.97 --> 1050.65
okay Oh what are you gonna teach him

1046.96 --> 1056.98
about Fe cosmology because it's still

1050.65 --> 1059.77
you know how careful will you be with

1056.98 --> 1063.03
teaching him because a lot of what's

1059.77 --> 1066.04
going around in Flat Earth the model

1063.03 --> 1068.56
yeah there's there's a whole range of

1066.04 --> 1070.45
things wrong with that as well so are

1068.56 --> 1072.52
you gonna give him the whole feeling

1070.45 --> 1076.1200000000001
with the disc presupposition and all

1072.52 --> 1078.45
that because there's just so much it

1076.12 --> 1078.4499999999998
yeah

1079.38 --> 1090.96
are you just gonna leave it to him okay

1087.49 --> 1090.96
no model okay

1094.23 --> 1097.41
[Music]

1100.62 --> 1106.1699999999998
[Music]

1120.78 --> 1127.25
okay

1123.38 --> 1129.4
yeah well best of luck pretty heavy

1127.25 --> 1129.4
stuff

1164.68 --> 1168.269
[Music]

1175.11 --> 1184.49
huh okay lunatic that's that's

1181.83 --> 1184.49
interesting

1212.68 --> 1215.49
hmm

1230.49 --> 1238.83
all right sedate that cousin - yeah it's

1232.8 --> 1241.68
good but it's it if I do something like

1238.83 --> 1245.3999999999999
that I'd bring in everything I'd bring

1241.68 --> 1247.44
in every reference and and also the

1245.4 --> 1252.5400000000002
trickery well it would be up to my kid

1247.44 --> 1255.96
like how interests that they are in even

1252.54 --> 1258.1499999999999
yeah societal structure and religion and

1255.96 --> 1262.05
story you know it would all depend on

1258.15 --> 1265.92
how much they're already into that in as

1262.05 --> 1267.96
to how how deep I would relay my own

1265.92 --> 1274.23
findings because that is pretty heavy

1267.96 --> 1276.45
stuff you know but yeah the more you

1274.23 --> 1279.3600000000001
give them to reflect upon also the more

1276.45 --> 1282.51
they realized like yeah people have been

1279.36 --> 1285.84
at this and trying to figure this out

1282.51 --> 1287.73
for a long time and this is how they

1285.84 --> 1290.84
conclude and that is how they concluded

1287.73 --> 1294.44
and that gives them a much more honest

1290.84 --> 1296.9099999999999
picture eventually that cannot be

1294.44 --> 1299.13
manipulated so easy as when you would

1296.91 --> 1302.8200000000002
only present a few sources or just a

1299.13 --> 1306.2900000000002
singular one see because if they've

1302.82 --> 1308.73
already seen anything that they can't be

1306.29 --> 1313.08
confronted with it in a manipulative way

1308.73 --> 1315.15
by somebody else in order to arouse some

1313.08 --> 1316.56
kind of hostility something you know

1315.15 --> 1322.5800000000002
because that is something that typically

1316.56 --> 1326.8799999999999
does happen now of hostility being some

1322.58 --> 1330.98
polarization being created between

1326.88 --> 1330.98
groups and religions all that

1360.1 --> 1366.25
right thinking too much yeah I know the

1363.16 --> 1369.22
problem any young but it is really a

1366.25 --> 1373.18
problem you know too much of anything is

1369.22 --> 1374.92
bad even thinking because if the

1373.18 --> 1375.75
thinking starts to take a life of its

1374.92 --> 1378.49
own

1375.75 --> 1382.35
then it's going to take away from just

1378.49 --> 1385.35
your down-to-earth life experience

1382.35 --> 1385.35
practically

1389.87 --> 1395.04
all right you start to migrate to that

1393.0 --> 1398.1
place where you have so much available I

1395.04 --> 1400.77
know everything about it it's like a

1398.1 --> 1404.73
serious problem it has been with me for

1400.77 --> 1408.17
a long time I even kind of considered it

1404.73 --> 1408.17
like a curse really

1413.58 --> 1422.36
does my mind stop yes it does or rather

1417.66 --> 1426.15
it doesn't really stop it it just rolls

1422.36 --> 1428.85
but I can basically also just look and

1426.15 --> 1431.27
not try to reflect some kind of idea

1428.85 --> 1437.1299999999999
upon it but it's tough because it's it

1431.27 --> 1441.57
easily happens by itself if I just let

1437.13 --> 1442.74
myself just hang it happens again again

1441.57 --> 1445.8899999999999
remember what I said earlier like

1442.74 --> 1446.52
compact try to stay here where I am

1445.89 --> 1448.68
right now

1446.52 --> 1451.04
that that's something that I kind of

1448.68 --> 1455.3400000000001
need to focus on otherwise it'll just go

1451.04 --> 1457.8899999999999
I'll start to reflect on everything like

1455.34 --> 1460.35
one moment will be a reflection not just

1457.89 --> 1463.38
of looking at a tree but it will be like

1460.35 --> 1465.99
a tied in with complex realization of

1463.38 --> 1468.69
past where it came from or it might go

1465.99 --> 1475.44
depending on everything else see it it's

1468.69 --> 1480.99
just yeah it's problematic just looking

1475.44 --> 1483.3300000000002
at a tree or a pillow or anything can

1480.99 --> 1485.85
just lead to the entire world being

1483.33 --> 1492.4099999999999
involved somehow it's bizarre how that

1485.85 --> 1492.4099999999999
goes and can be very draining

1499.82 --> 1508.95
yeah and it can also be evasive or like

1506.73 --> 1513.75
an invasion of the mind almost because

1508.95 --> 1515.94
sometimes if I get over focused on for

1513.75 --> 1519.18
example a certain type of group of

1515.94 --> 1522.42
people or key individuals that are

1519.18 --> 1524.49
having some important even potentially

1522.42 --> 1527.28
interdimensional dealings right now in

1524.49 --> 1529.53
the situation in this realm if I get

1527.28 --> 1532.5
over focus then they will almost like

1529.53 --> 1534.3
invade my thoughts because I will be

1532.5 --> 1537.96
thinking about something and then they

1534.3 --> 1540.4199999999998
slip in and have this influence with

1537.96 --> 1541.6200000000001
their ethereal presence in all things

1540.42 --> 1544.3500000000001
among it can be actually quite

1541.62 --> 1549.84
aggravating it can be haunting that way

1544.35 --> 1553.02
it's it's bizarre how presences of

1549.84 --> 1555.1999999999998
existence of individuals and the

1553.02 --> 1558.3
realization that they are out there and

1555.2 --> 1560.5800000000002
are also potentially doing something

1558.3 --> 1565.1399999999999
like this in their own way with their

1560.58 --> 1567.87
own plans it feels like they invade your

1565.14 --> 1571.74
mind if you get over focusing and I

1567.87 --> 1574.8
think that savannas have this problem we

1571.74 --> 1577.35
are first and foremost sub session and

1574.8 --> 1582.11
when you obsess everything becomes the

1577.35 --> 1582.11
thing you obsess over everything and

1582.41 --> 1587.0700000000002
yeah it's I don't know I I don't

1585.36 --> 1589.29
understand why they don't see it as a

1587.07 --> 1591.21
warning sign or is it just too late are

1589.29 --> 1594.02
they just a moth to the flame in it they

1591.21 --> 1596.88
have no control over it anymore

1594.02 --> 1598.95
has the flame burned them out so much

1596.88 --> 1601.2600000000002
that they don't even see it anymore it's

1598.95 --> 1603.06
just a fully automated process there's

1601.26 --> 1607.34
no actual intellectual involvement

1603.06 --> 1607.34
anymore is that it I don't know

1610.35 --> 1618.1599999999999
but yeah letting go is is a skill you

1614.74 --> 1622.26
need when you got a big mind you need to

1618.16 --> 1625.21
be able to let go it's very important

1622.26 --> 1627.81
because otherwise your mind will take

1625.21 --> 1627.81
you over

1631.84 --> 1641.78
[Music]

1638.78 --> 1641.78
anyway

1653.11 --> 1664.799
yes I know lunatic it is yeah well look

1662.59 --> 1669.1899999999998
the world the media the government

1664.799 --> 1676.57
they've presented a giant puzzle a very

1669.19 --> 1679.779
complicated giant puzzle and since it is

1676.57 --> 1682.09
kind of perceived by the public also

1679.779 --> 1683.98
because of what is given away that the

1682.09 --> 1689.499
government is kind of more openly

1683.98 --> 1691.33
hostile they are they feel forced almost

1689.499 --> 1696.97
like a threat date and they have to meet

1691.33 --> 1699.73
the threat by figuring it out see so it

1696.97 --> 1702.249
is in a way just a very complex busy in

1699.73 --> 1704.73
therapy almost in a way that's been very

1702.249 --> 1708.19
carefully prepared for a long time and

1704.73 --> 1712.45
yeah Big Bear Oh Benjamin revealed that

1708.19 --> 1716.3200000000002
yesterday very very elaborately in a

1712.45 --> 1721.45
video that in retrospect I even remember

1716.32 --> 1724.84
seeing live and it was like what what is

1721.45 --> 1727.72
all this and I felt like they're they're

1724.84 --> 1732.4289999999999
gonna push [ __ ] that's what I felt from

1727.72 --> 1735.72
it but I now seeing it back it's just

1732.429 --> 1741.72
like what's really it's that detailed

1735.72 --> 1741.72
the what was it it was a Olympic show in

1743.07 --> 1752.9189999999999
2012 or something right and they had

1749.409 --> 1755.8300000000002
like this whole in-between spectacle

1752.919 --> 1760.169
show why they brought out like giant

1755.83 --> 1764.139
amounts of nurses with empty beds

1760.169 --> 1769.6000000000001
rolling around and then they had moments

1764.139 --> 1773.019
where they yeah he saw just like light

1769.6 --> 1774.6689999999999
based pictures that with the top down

1773.019 --> 1778.33
field in the stadium you could see and

1774.669 --> 1783.7700000000002
then they would flash a literal drawing

1778.33 --> 1786.71
of what we now have been called said

1783.77 --> 1788.69
the that a corona are that a virus looks

1786.71 --> 1798.8600000000001
like it would flash like a virus like

1788.69 --> 1800.66
that beep like really this insane and it

1798.86 --> 1803.1789999999999
was funny because Owen Benjamin showed

1800.66 --> 1805.0400000000002
that video and it became here he said

1803.179 --> 1807.3500000000001
like don't watch the text because the

1805.04 --> 1809.71
maker of this video is just he's

1807.35 --> 1813.4699999999998
spiraling out of control is completely

1809.71 --> 1813.89
he's missing the whole point of his own

1813.47 --> 1816.32
video

1813.89 --> 1820.5200000000002
he's a total Savannah in the West so

1816.32 --> 1824.96
apparel is hilarious but just what was

1820.52 --> 1827.24
on video that that that event in 2012

1824.96 --> 1829.64
during the Olympics is just like if you

1827.24 --> 1831.59
see that now and then look at the world

1829.64 --> 1837.0200000000002
right now what's going on it's just like

1831.59 --> 1842.09
what it did yeah you can get more

1837.02 --> 1845.86
predictive programming than that it's so

1842.09 --> 1845.86
detailed it's bizarre

1855.57 --> 1865.4199999999998
well lunatic I think that the image is

1861.4 --> 1871.48
like a slightly slight artistically

1865.42 --> 1874.72
interpreted way to represent what was

1871.48 --> 1878.17
kind of identified as a virus it's just

1874.72 --> 1881.65
that it's so small it's kind of it's

1878.17 --> 1884.47
yeah it's not that distinct so then they

1881.65 --> 1888.0700000000002
had like the idea of suction cups which

1884.47 --> 1891.72
is based again on the I don't know the

1888.07 --> 1894.55
the system that is typically used for

1891.72 --> 1896.8
microbiology they work with suction cups

1894.55 --> 1898.18
and connectors and all that and they and

1896.8 --> 1901.74
that's just how they came to represent

1898.18 --> 1905.95
it so they kind of designed it like that

1901.74 --> 1907.72
it's like a bland between mechanical

1905.95 --> 1910.66
interpretation of how these things work

1907.72 --> 1913.27
and a very blurry image of what they

1910.66 --> 1915.7900000000002
kind of think is a virus I think that's

1913.27 --> 1920.98
what I think that the device image is

1915.79 --> 1923.3799999999999
really what it really represents do have

1920.98 --> 1927.07
a link to Owens show no sorry when one

1923.38 --> 1934.8700000000001
walk out it was a live stream them on D

1927.07 --> 1937.74
life and yeah that's the if you really

1934.87 --> 1942.25
want to see it back he has a site an

1937.74 --> 1944.14
authorized TV and he puts all the videos

1942.25 --> 1946.96
of his streams there as well so that you

1944.14 --> 1948.7
could see it back or you could catch

1946.96 --> 1951.69
another live stream and hope that he

1948.7 --> 1951.69
kind of plays it again

1956.529 --> 1963.61
but yeah Oh Benjamin the streams on a

1960.529 --> 1966.559
daily basis I always try to be there

1963.61 --> 1968.7199999999998
because it is awesome and he's like

1966.559 --> 1972.49
interactive with Chad and all and it's I

1968.72 --> 1972.49
don't know it's just a great experience

1974.02 --> 1984.799
anyway that's where you can find him

1980.65 --> 1987.01
wait no that's not this is where you can

1984.799 --> 1987.01
find

1998.62 --> 2012.09
what time is he on it it it differs per

2008.61 --> 2015.4189999999999
day it really does usually does two

2012.09 --> 2017.9089999999999
streams if I remember correctly he does

2015.419 --> 2020.76
one at 6:00 p.m.

2017.909 --> 2025.0800000000002
Amsterdam time sometimes or somewhere

2020.76 --> 2030.48
there and then often much later he does

2025.08 --> 2034.1899999999998
another one and usually around or after

2030.48 --> 2041.549
2:00 p.m. or 2:00 a.m. I'm so damn time

2034.19 --> 2044.46
so right but he doesn't really announce

2041.549 --> 2046.8899999999999
it you just got to pay attention to when

2044.46 --> 2055.589
the life says that he's going live and

2046.89 --> 2060.869
then be there quickly anyway yeah it was

2055.589 --> 2062.73
great and it was very typical because

2060.869 --> 2065.909
yeah I was watching that

2062.73 --> 2069.0
it was absolutely crushing and then was

2065.909 --> 2071.609
8 o'clock and I saw quantum eraser going

2069.0 --> 2075.99
live oh wait I have to be on that panel

2071.609 --> 2078.72
and then yeah oh and Benjamin also

2075.99 --> 2081.629
rounded out the show right then which I

2078.72 --> 2085.3199999999997
thought was very convenient and then I

2081.629 --> 2088.0499999999997
got directly on the on the ball-busters

2085.32 --> 2088.3790000000004
panel at this court and that lasted so

2088.05 --> 2091.4900000000002
long

2088.379 --> 2091.49
holy [ __ ]

2091.949 --> 2095.089
[Music]

2096.7 --> 2109.24
so all-in-all I think I've been like

2100.37 --> 2109.24
eight hours active interactive yesterday

2115.57 --> 2120.36
okay thanks for that Patricia Dockery

2127.95 --> 2133.1699999999996
but by the way that's just an estimate

2129.809 --> 2136.77
I'm not entirely sure what his exact

2133.17 --> 2139.4700000000003
schedule is was also because some you

2136.77 --> 2144.24
know he has a very busy life and

2139.47 --> 2147.9199999999996
sometimes he just has to plan to do

2144.24 --> 2150.4199999999996
unusual or yet not daily things and then

2147.92 --> 2152.64
it doesn't stream where he streams at

2150.42 --> 2155.28
another time and yet give you never

2152.64 --> 2158.46
really know in advance until it just

2155.28 --> 2160.02
goes like at least I don't maybe he does

2158.46 --> 2161.64
have a schedule written down somewhere

2160.02 --> 2163.71
like an agenda I don't know maybe that's

2161.64 --> 2177.93
an unauthorized that TV I don't know I'm

2163.71 --> 2180.079
not a member of it okay Steve I feel for

2177.93 --> 2180.0789999999997
you

2185.44 --> 2193.71
I don't know well maybe just defiance

2189.99 --> 2193.7099999999996
doesn't do it for you

2200.71 --> 2203.339
right

2204.56 --> 2207.56
right

2223.5 --> 2229.15
yeah this comedy is great but what I

2226.66 --> 2232.8999999999996
love about Owen especially is just that

2229.15 --> 2235.27
he's this fountain of energy and he has

2232.9 --> 2236.109
just seems like it just has unlimited

2235.27 --> 2238.63
power

2236.109 --> 2243.569
he doesn't really but he just has so

2238.63 --> 2247.48
much of it and it's just impressive

2243.569 --> 2250.329
because he he does he has a daily show

2247.48 --> 2253.569
too but when he does it he interacts

2250.329 --> 2256.7200000000003
with much many more people and he always

2253.569 --> 2263.109
has material and he keeps on talking

2256.72 --> 2268.7799999999997
II never silences he's he's just I don't

2263.109 --> 2270.7889999999998
know it's just better but anyway

2268.78 --> 2274.9900000000002
everyone has their own skill set

2270.789 --> 2277.869
everything I'm pretty sure that I am no

2274.99 --> 2281.97
insanely much about cosmogony and

2277.869 --> 2281.9700000000003
presuppositional Cosmo Jean and all that

2284.19 --> 2292.18
but yeah the Big Bear certainly makes me

2287.559 --> 2295.44
laugh my ass off a lot and it's great

2292.18 --> 2295.44
it's very therapeutic

2300.08 --> 2305.36
[Music]

2315.13 --> 2319.4100000000003
yeah by the way lots of people are

2317.259 --> 2321.97
making a lot of good videos recently

2319.41 --> 2325.479
it's a quantum of conscious has also

2321.97 --> 2332.859
been just doing very interesting things

2325.479 --> 2336.5989999999997
like yeah just detailing on his

2332.859 --> 2342.64
conceptions that I think are yeah

2336.599 --> 2344.65
they're pretty consistent and I just

2342.64 --> 2351.009
like how what he's building with his

2344.65 --> 2353.259
mind I think a lot of people do in a way

2351.009 --> 2355.989
it feels like he's also kind of a Cosmo

2353.259 --> 2359.92
genus except it's maybe you little less

2355.989 --> 2362.339
academic at it it's more wider more

2359.92 --> 2367.259
about the spirits in the individual and

2362.339 --> 2372.19
meeting and creation and then

2367.259 --> 2376.2690000000002
philosophical angles to it consequences

2372.19 --> 2379.66
I don't know I talk about the same type

2376.269 --> 2383.109
of things to a lot except I don't

2379.66 --> 2385.41
pre-recorded I do it all improvised

2383.109 --> 2389.499
because it's all just here it's there

2385.41 --> 2392.469
and I know it's there I could just put

2389.499 --> 2396.249
it out there just like any silly baller

2392.469 --> 2398.319
can come to me and just like I'm gonna

2396.249 --> 2400.5589999999997
ask her the question that he doesn't

2398.319 --> 2404.349
know because I haven't thought about it

2400.559 --> 2407.1090000000004
and then I explained him on the spot

2404.349 --> 2410.8900000000003
might even hand him some extra tools

2407.109 --> 2415.92
they obviously hadn't picked up on with

2410.89 --> 2415.92
his belief because it's all here

2433.31 --> 2440.61
whoo-hoo okay well good for him

2438.27 --> 2442.65
Missouri Salina you know conspiracy cats

2440.61 --> 2446.2200000000003
has been on my channel as well maybe you

2442.65 --> 2449.82
guys have forgotten it's been some time

2446.22 --> 2453.8399999999997
ago but he was here as well remember

2449.82 --> 2456.6600000000003
that's the time he admitted that that

2453.84 --> 2458.61
you actually do require a container in

2456.66 --> 2466.29
order to have gas pressure remember that

2458.61 --> 2467.9700000000003
the good old days so who knows what he's

2466.29 --> 2471.3
bringing had gonna bring to the table

2467.97 --> 2473.3399999999997
who knows maybe he's actually having

2471.3 --> 2476.4
more doubts you know he did have doubts

2473.34 --> 2479.01
remember he had sleepless nights so who

2476.4 --> 2487.37
knows what's happening with him could be

2479.01 --> 2491.34
halfway interesting guys so oh yeah and

2487.37 --> 2493.98
yesterday also on ball busters like

2491.34 --> 2497.4300000000003
rumpus came on for how long was it I

2493.98 --> 2503.79
think about three seconds before cue he

2497.43 --> 2509.5099999999998
kicked him out and it was like ah come

2503.79 --> 2509.5099999999998
on I want to hear about this

2529.03 --> 2532.179
[Music]

2534.31 --> 2539.39
right

2535.55 --> 2542.3590000000004
I saw yeah I've also been pondering upon

2539.39 --> 2556.0099999999998
an idea that's been kind of well shoved

2542.359 --> 2562.58
in my face by again the what's his name

2556.01 --> 2566.21
again Brian right he said that yeah are

2562.58 --> 2568.97
when you got all these baller ideas you

2566.21 --> 2572.21
know I kind of keep bragging about it

2568.97 --> 2573.74
and not trying to reveal too much but

2572.21 --> 2576.8
how I got all these ideas and he said

2573.74 --> 2579.2299999999996
like I you gotta you just gotta write a

2576.8 --> 2584.0
book you got to do it and like oh that

2579.23 --> 2588.94
feels so wrong that just but I'm

2584.0 --> 2594.609
thinking of that maybe I could do a more

2588.94 --> 2600.89
picture based science fiction type book

2594.609 --> 2603.41
to kind of explain my concepts so it

2600.89 --> 2606.7999999999997
wouldn't be like is science literature

2603.41 --> 2609.29
which would be extremely disingenuous if

2606.8 --> 2613.03
I did that with my presuppositional

2609.29 --> 2616.46
concepts if I picture it all it could be

2613.03 --> 2620.1800000000003
just interesting and maybe not so

2616.46 --> 2622.25
harmful because if it's just pictures

2620.18 --> 2626.0899999999997
and a couple of sentences and and all

2622.25 --> 2629.45
that then you know could somebody

2626.09 --> 2631.63
actually say uh you have falsified

2629.45 --> 2634.52
science but it's just a picture book

2631.63 --> 2637.94
it's almost like saying that the molten

2634.52 --> 2640.06
iron core pictures which are ups

2637.94 --> 2644.78
absolutely concepts are like

2640.06 --> 2649.609
falsification no it's it's just a

2644.78 --> 2651.17
conceptual picture basically like

2649.609 --> 2654.43
nobody's claiming that that's a

2651.17 --> 2657.4300000000003
photograph it's just a artistic

2654.43 --> 2657.43
interpretation

2662.079 --> 2668.0190000000002
but anyway I'm thinking about it we'll

2665.359 --> 2668.019
see where it goes

2677.7 --> 2686.069
where has Obama come in uh yeah I don't

2683.97 --> 2689.43
know I think I do see him around every

2686.069 --> 2694.609
now and then but maybe he's just moved

2689.43 --> 2699.6299999999997
his his rhythm I don't know

2694.609 --> 2700.38
yeah was here yesterday okay Wow look at

2699.63 --> 2709.6800000000003
the votes

2700.38 --> 2712.6400000000003
look at the votes it's like I have my

2709.68 --> 2717.8089999999997
show here every day every day and

2712.64 --> 2719.73
there's people here every day piling on

2717.809 --> 2726.6800000000003
these down votes it's just like really

2719.73 --> 2726.68
people is that your your dedication and

2729.529 --> 2735.95
it's that's what it is but just it

2733.74 --> 2738.99
sometimes just baffles me that like why

2735.95 --> 2743.3689999999997
why don't you give up you know it would

2738.99 --> 2745.7099999999996
probably demotivate me slightly if there

2743.369 --> 2747.869
was no more down votes because then I

2745.71 --> 2750.63
guess I'd feel like less of a threat I

2747.869 --> 2755.46
know that I'm probably the biggest

2750.63 --> 2761.7000000000003
threat ever and that if they could they

2755.46 --> 2767.13
would pile it on even more right but I'm

2761.7 --> 2769.319
just saying effectively if I if they

2767.13 --> 2775.369
didn't do that I'd probably feel more

2769.319 --> 2777.99
desperate really so who is doing it

2775.369 --> 2779.96
somebody some weirdo in the shadow is

2777.99 --> 2782.8489999999997
doing that because they have this weird

2779.96 --> 2786.18
doublethink idea of like hahaha yes if

2782.849 --> 2788.6400000000003
we down called him he'll show even more

2786.18 --> 2789.529
and then we might be able to catch him

2788.64 --> 2791.7
sometimes

2789.529 --> 2794.569
something I don't know what the reason

2791.7 --> 2794.569
is why people do this

2796.57 --> 2805.75
a threat I'm a threat to their dreams

2800.05 --> 2808.48
I'm a very serious threat because I am

2805.75 --> 2813.94
practically a builder of their dreams

2808.48 --> 2819.96
and they know it they can feel it so I

2813.94 --> 2823.12
could literally as a hostile alter their

2819.96 --> 2827.46
religion they can feel it it's very

2823.12 --> 2827.46
threatening very threatening

2831.85 --> 2834.909
[Music]

2842.76 --> 2845.48
right

2845.59 --> 2850.9300000000003
well mark color I don't know what it is

2847.98 --> 2854.08
you know sometimes I do down fold as

2850.93 --> 2856.24
well especially if it's somebody that I

2854.08 --> 2857.7999999999997
usually like and they do something or

2856.24 --> 2860.2299999999996
they put something out that it just

2857.8 --> 2863.3500000000004
really hits me the wrong way that I'm

2860.23 --> 2865.81
seriously disappointed unexpectedly then

2863.35 --> 2868.83
I'll down folk doesn't mean anything but

2865.81 --> 2875.62
I'll do it out of principle but this

2868.83 --> 2878.88
just doing this everyday really know

2875.62 --> 2878.88
that that's ridiculous

2881.5 --> 2889.489
[Music]

2899.08 --> 2905.25
right I've wondered sometimes more

2902.08 --> 2907.5099999999998
colored if some people are into this

2905.25 --> 2910.57
like a political game

2907.51 --> 2913.21
I really wonder sometimes if they're

2910.57 --> 2915.1000000000004
just looking at statistics and they're

2913.21 --> 2918.9900000000002
only about statistics and they're like

2915.1 --> 2921.91
if we can just make everything

2918.99 --> 2925.0299999999997
threatening intellectually in Flat Earth

2921.91 --> 2929.35
if we can just demotivate it or show it

2925.03 --> 2932.23
as ugly and then the ones that are nice

2929.35 --> 2933.91
on the bowler side and that are unlikely

2932.23 --> 2936.22
to wake up because they're too deeply

2933.91 --> 2939.81
into the dream and just make it them

2936.22 --> 2946.3599999999997
look all happy and great and support it

2939.81 --> 2951.19
maybe that is it but Wow so that's your

2946.36 --> 2953.8900000000003
life now is it it's making politics out

2951.19 --> 2962.4700000000003
of something that actually isn't even

2953.89 --> 2965.5
politics like politics is already pretty

2962.47 --> 2970.0299999999997
pathetic and disgusting and anyone that

2965.5 --> 2972.37
has a soul left knows that and hates it

2970.03 --> 2976.03
and hates it when people politicize even

2972.37 --> 2979.3199999999997
on their own side because it just takes

2976.03 --> 2985.2400000000002
away spirit takes away genuine

2979.32 --> 2988.42
genuineness and these people seem to

2985.24 --> 2990.58
just not even it's not yeah it's not

2988.42 --> 2993.07
about power I guess in a way it's about

2990.58 --> 2997.59
petty power it's almost like a political

2993.07 --> 3001.23
struggle for petty power within

2997.59 --> 3003.69
religious circle isn't it isn't that

3001.23 --> 3011.75
really what what's happening what these

3003.69 --> 3016.28
ballers do exerting political power for

3011.75 --> 3016.28
yeah for religious reasons

3018.829 --> 3025.489
because they're not actually

3021.569 --> 3028.349
constructing any arguments at this point

3025.489 --> 3030.329
they're just gas lighting that just red

3028.349 --> 3034.1090000000004
herring that just straw Manning wherever

3030.329 --> 3036.469
they can trying to desperately use any

3034.109 --> 3040.649
kind of mistakes in the past or

3036.469 --> 3045.449
misinterpretations or just a knowingness

3040.649 --> 3048.179
of our starting journey to try to

3045.449 --> 3051.4790000000003
strawman us and and and throw us back to

3048.179 --> 3053.9990000000003
that mentality to that position in their

3051.479 --> 3055.9489999999996
development so that they could half way

3053.999 --> 3059.549
handle us again because we didn't know

3055.949 --> 3061.879
everything yet it's that's what it's

3059.549 --> 3061.879
become

3070.95 --> 3074.0499999999997
[Music]

3078.86 --> 3081.9190000000003
[Music]

3089.98 --> 3095.75
well me to me acaba I don't I don't down

3093.41 --> 3098.92
fault lightly I rarely do that it's

3095.75 --> 3103.46
usually only when I'm just like

3098.92 --> 3106.78
personally offended but I only do it

3103.46 --> 3110.45
with people that I usually respect a lot

3106.78 --> 3112.5800000000004
because if it's just like Jose and or

3110.45 --> 3116.66
some baller it's like yeah I'm gonna

3112.58 --> 3118.52
download it for that because yeah what

3116.66 --> 3121.31
do you expect you know when you get in

3118.52 --> 3123.77
there that shit's gonna happen no I only

3121.31 --> 3128.0299999999997
do that when I'm really like offended we

3123.77 --> 3131.56
for something that I didn't expect right

3128.03 --> 3131.5600000000004
that's very rare

3141.3 --> 3144.699
[Music]

3156.17 --> 3162.5
we were all ballers at some point at one

3158.99 --> 3165.74
point well I don't know you know what is

3162.5 --> 3168.02
a baller nowadays is a baller who just

3165.74 --> 3172.18
believes the earth is a ball or is a

3168.02 --> 3175.43
baller that keeps on doubling down and

3172.18 --> 3180.589
trying to force the earth to be a ball

3175.43 --> 3182.5989999999997
you know because regulars people out

3180.589 --> 3184.069
there that don't really pay more too

3182.599 --> 3189.01
much attention yeah they may believe

3184.069 --> 3192.43
it's a ball but they might decline

3189.01 --> 3197.38
inquiring more information about it but

3192.43 --> 3202.04
they're not gonna like lie knowingly lie

3197.38 --> 3203.42
to defend it you know that's more in in

3202.04 --> 3206.27
the ballers lane that's what they that's

3203.42 --> 3210.559
the ballers that we know that's what

3206.27 --> 3213.17
they do that's really a baller I think a

3210.559 --> 3214.46
regular they may believe in the ball but

3213.17 --> 3216.23
that doesn't mean that they're going to

3214.46 --> 3219.049
behave like the ballers do necessarily

3216.23 --> 3221.66
they might because they're already kind

3219.049 --> 3224.809
of bit of squirt boys and all that they

3221.66 --> 3227.21
have squirt boy tendencies by themselves

3224.809 --> 3231.3190000000004
unrelated so they might go and do that

3227.21 --> 3234.339
naturally but regulars are not like

3231.319 --> 3234.339
ballers that we know

3241.68 --> 3246.0299999999997
the option to unemployment

3249.66 --> 3253.19
I don't know what you're talking about

3264.35 --> 3274.48
oh okay if you say so you have a

3269.56 --> 3274.48
whatever you need to say to find peace

3299.32 --> 3301.98
right

3306.42 --> 3313.2000000000003
I don't know I don't think I really ever

3308.849 --> 3321.3900000000003
was like an indoctrinated baller I was

3313.2 --> 3324.54
just a naive ball cosmology enthusiast

3321.39 --> 3328.8289999999997
really that's more like what I was like

3324.54 --> 3331.47
I would not go and get disgusting or

3328.829 --> 3333.7200000000003
like going to peer pressure when I

3331.47 --> 3336.75
couldn't win an argument no never I

3333.72 --> 3339.5989999999997
would always use my creativity to get an

3336.75 --> 3341.819
answer always always and that's the

3339.599 --> 3347.9100000000003
whole thing that made it so appealing to

3341.819 --> 3351.24
me gave me this opportunity to to figure

3347.91 --> 3354.66
something out on the spot and in a way I

3351.24 --> 3358.5789999999997
still AM a ball cosmology enthusiast I'm

3354.66 --> 3358.5789999999997
just not as naive as I used to be

3366.21 --> 3375.359
because I don't believe anymore that it

3369.97 --> 3375.359
could technically be possible I used to

3384.69 --> 3392.819
like yeah yeah the only way you can

3390.3 --> 3395.069
still reach any kind of conclusion that

3392.819 --> 3398.04
it might be a ball is if you start to

3395.069 --> 3401.609
say nothing is as it seems

3398.04 --> 3405.15
but with that is absolutely nothing not

3401.609 --> 3407.88
just our perceptions just literally

3405.15 --> 3411.859
nothing would be as it seems if the

3407.88 --> 3416.94
earth was a ball well that's not a very

3411.859 --> 3419.63
well that's very sell of Cystic that's

3416.94 --> 3422.73
why I'd like to say when ballers just

3419.63 --> 3425.25
completely go down that road they go

3422.73 --> 3428.39
into solipsistic reversal they go into

3425.25 --> 3430.95
like a solipsist the solipsistic panic

3428.39 --> 3436.14
start to say nothing is realized because

3430.95 --> 3440.22
yeah that's the only way philosophically

3436.14 --> 3442.3799999999997
the earth could be a ball if nothing at

3440.22 --> 3446.25
all nothing is as it seems

3442.38 --> 3450.9
so yeah that's what happens when you

3446.25 --> 3456.68
hold on too long in your train of

3450.9 --> 3456.6800000000003
thoughts total solipsistic reversal

3461.549 --> 3469.299
yeah well illuminator this small skill

3466.359 --> 3474.91
is the only skill that is real there is

3469.299 --> 3478.569
no cosmic scale there is no proof of a

3474.91 --> 3486.39
distance after a certain point there's

3478.569 --> 3489.009
no proof of it there's no proof of this

3486.39 --> 3497.89
fastness that is presupposed with the

3489.009 --> 3500.199
glow cosmology doesn't exist pretty big

3497.89 --> 3503.339
though you know and could even be bigger

3500.199 --> 3508.599
than we are currently sizing it up ass

3503.339 --> 3512.65
but it's not that insanely seemingly

3508.599 --> 3519.869
infinitely fast that's not gonna happen

3512.65 --> 3519.869
this is this dear

3526.01 --> 3529.9300000000003
no they don't Harry Cornwall

3559.72 --> 3564.019
[Music]

3572.8 --> 3578.63
yeah more color that is way too specific

3575.99 --> 3581.27
for me you know there's all kinds of

3578.63 --> 3585.71
things that are just very off concerning

3581.27 --> 3589.13
the lighting in actual observations

3585.71 --> 3591.11
compared to how it should be if all

3589.13 --> 3592.9100000000003
these heavenly bodies like the moon and

3591.11 --> 3596.26
the Sun were physical and the earth was

3592.91 --> 3599.96
a ball in between all that yeah it it

3596.26 --> 3602.75
almost works out but it doesn't really

3599.96 --> 3604.4900000000002
there is still a factor of suspense of

3602.75 --> 3608.03
disbelief you have to kind of put in

3604.49 --> 3611.54
between their at points because almost

3608.03 --> 3614.63
kind of works it's not too hard to

3611.54 --> 3618.2599999999998
imagine how it should work sort of and

3614.63 --> 3621.71
that what you see might be kind of like

3618.26 --> 3625.0400000000004
that but when you really carefully

3621.71 --> 3627.7400000000002
carefully detail it out an emulated 3d

3625.04 --> 3630.56
modeling all that yeah that it doesn't

3627.74 --> 3633.47
work out at all it's just the lighting

3630.56 --> 3636.17
of the moon is ridiculous that's not how

3633.47 --> 3639.68
the lighting of a ball looks like at all

3636.17 --> 3641.51
it's just absolutely absurd and if you

3639.68 --> 3644.45
don't think too carefully about it yeah

3641.51 --> 3647.26
my sort of work you know if you don't

3644.45 --> 3647.2599999999998
think about it too hard

3651.61 --> 3654.8700000000003
what was that ooh

3659.79 --> 3665.98
it's always so disappointing every time

3662.47 --> 3668.3799999999997
there's like some kind of baller saying

3665.98 --> 3671.32
something stupid I always hope you know

3668.38 --> 3677.4900000000002
that that stupid little comment is only

3671.32 --> 3680.38
like a first poke to kind of

3677.49 --> 3682.3599999999997
strategically make us underestimate how

3680.38 --> 3685.33
smart he really is yeah I always hope

3682.36 --> 3687.9
for that I literally always it's like no

3685.33 --> 3690.73
no no he can't possibly be that stupid

3687.9 --> 3692.6800000000003
it has to be a trick and he's gonna slap

3690.73 --> 3699.34
us with some real data all of a sudden

3692.68 --> 3703.7799999999997
as a challenge you know but I guess that

3699.34 --> 3709.7400000000002
reality that that doesn't happen very

3703.78 --> 3709.7400000000002
often it's so sad really

3716.35 --> 3719.44
[Music]

3724.829 --> 3736.27
okay thank we careful with that oh by

3731.079 --> 3740.619
the way a good way to dampen the impact

3736.27 --> 3745.319
of coffee which I've at least as far as

3740.619 --> 3745.319
I've experienced is using turmeric in it

3745.44 --> 3753.25
don't know if you do I don't know if you

3750.01 --> 3756.599
tried it maybe you won't like it but for

3753.25 --> 3756.599
me it made it quite a difference

3760.04 --> 3763.09
[Music]

3770.11 --> 3778.06
right oh yeah also I've been pondering

3772.72 --> 3780.04
upon a Einstein in solution as to why

3778.06 --> 3782.41
the earth would be spinning without

3780.04 --> 3785.23
actually having the effects of spinning

3782.41 --> 3787.2999999999997
and it's not based on the theory of

3785.23 --> 3789.13
relativity which makes no sense and is

3787.3 --> 3792.4300000000003
disproven really because there is an

3789.13 --> 3794.83
effect of actual motion but I've managed

3792.43 --> 3799.77
to fixed it with more spacetime bending

3794.83 --> 3799.77
as a side effect of the natural gravity

3799.95 --> 3810.8999999999996
space bending distribution I might put

3805.84 --> 3813.46
that into into the picture book too

3810.9 --> 3814.27
seriously guys I've thought of freaking

3813.46 --> 3816.76
everything

3814.27 --> 3821.61
it's almost makes me kind of

3816.76 --> 3821.61
uncomfortable serious

3839.81 --> 3842.77
prove it

3844.42 --> 3853.42
okay well first you have to presuppose

3847.569 --> 3857.2889999999998
that Einstein and sense conceptual

3853.42 --> 3860.92
medium is actually real if you do that

3857.289 --> 3863.079
then we can continue but I'm not gonna

3860.92 --> 3865.119
explain it all on this show but I don't

3863.079 --> 3865.539
want to just put it out there just like

3865.119 --> 3870.609
that

3865.539 --> 3875.01
a flip book

3870.609 --> 3881.769
maybe that's funny actually you know

3875.01 --> 3885.76
maybe I could even think of wow you know

3881.769 --> 3888.3689999999997
those books where there's like like part

3885.76 --> 3891.8190000000004
of the book folds and you can have like

3888.369 --> 3895.2400000000002
these 3d things with it maybe I can do

3891.819 --> 3899.109
something like that with this then like

3895.24 --> 3905.1699999999996
you had a folded ball earth and a folded

3899.109 --> 3911.3089999999997
ball moving a key I'm in cept about that

3905.17 --> 3915.88
blood dad it's it's not even my idea

3911.309 --> 3919.559
said damn Brian I literally had to tell

3915.88 --> 3927.21
him stop it Lucifer stop seducing me

3919.559 --> 3927.21
because he wouldn't stop oh okay dad

3943.02 --> 3946.44
what's going on

3964.31 --> 3975.62
everybody's still there my show enables

3972.02 --> 3979.57
you coffee drinkers I don't drink coffee

3975.62 --> 3982.64
on my show anymore as I used to okay I

3979.57 --> 3988.07
just have some advice concerning coffee

3982.64 --> 3989.6299999999997
that's all hey and every time I

3988.07 --> 3992.5
mentioned it I do mention like don't

3989.63 --> 3992.5
drink too much of it

3997.28 --> 4000.5690000000004
[Music]

4007.0 --> 4015.16
right

4009.19 --> 4018.27
now but I can't get it out of my head

4015.16 --> 4026.91
yeah I've thought of something

4018.27 --> 4026.91
interesting like I've stopped it

4033.839 --> 4038.5789999999997
but the weird thing is is that in my

4036.559 --> 4041.67
conceptualizations with space-time

4038.579 --> 4044.579
bending and all that I've even managed

4041.67 --> 4052.349
to like almost by accident stumble upon

4044.579 --> 4056.2490000000003
elements that could explain things that

4052.349 --> 4057.869
are part of the entire act of what has

4056.249 --> 4060.1499999999996
been happening with outer space and

4057.869 --> 4063.6600000000003
science fiction that haven't even been

4060.15 --> 4067.049
properly addressed and actually figure

4063.66 --> 4070.229
it out reasons why those things are the

4067.049 --> 4080.4
way they are with my conceptualization

4070.229 --> 4084.7189999999996
it's so crazy like for example remember

4080.4 --> 4089.7290000000003
the the typical war or the thing that is

4084.719 --> 4092.579
a thing of how when things ships enter

4089.729 --> 4096.599
the atmosphere they get all he hot and

4092.579 --> 4099.299
bernie right well think about that the

4096.599 --> 4102.089
only reason they even sorta give with

4099.299 --> 4105.75
that is there is a thermosphere up there

4102.089 --> 4108.359
somewhere and then when you go into it

4105.75 --> 4112.469
from the outside you need up well if you

4108.359 --> 4117.089
get out of it you don't you know that

4112.469 --> 4123.179
doesn't make any constructive sense

4117.089 --> 4126.23
whatsoever it's like it's like a shove

4123.179 --> 4130.349
the dust under the carpet job that bad

4126.23 --> 4132.959999999999
it's literally not a reason it makes no

4130.349 --> 4135.569
freakin sense mechanically in any way

4132.96 --> 4137.759
there is no technical explanation as to

4135.569 --> 4140.1900000000005
why it works the way it does well guess

4137.759 --> 4144.299
what I figured out a better reason for

4140.19 --> 4148.339
that to be there yeah but I'm not

4144.299 --> 4148.339
telling it not yet anyway

4160.13 --> 4169.4800000000005
ah making me all giggly

4181.44 --> 4190.759999999999
yeah because there

4185.15 --> 4194.03
typically there is no way that for an

4190.76 --> 4196.16
object moving through air that the sheer

4194.03 --> 4199.28
speed of moving through that air is

4196.16 --> 4201.8
gonna cause so much friction that it

4199.28 --> 4205.759999999999
would heat something up I don't think

4201.8 --> 4209.33
that can be demonstrated literally like

4205.76 --> 4211.12
think about it even a railgun right this

4209.33 --> 4214.55
is this weird thing that shoots

4211.12 --> 4217.15
something magnetically at well such

4214.55 --> 4220.6900000000005
insane speeds that the sheer

4217.15 --> 4224.8099999999995
acceleration of it kind of like melts

4220.69 --> 4227.36
the projectile but it is the literal

4224.81 --> 4229.43
object accelerating that is causing that

4227.36 --> 4232.58
heat it's not because of some air

4229.43 --> 4234.08
friction no that entire concept that the

4232.58 --> 4238.76
heat would arise because of some

4234.08 --> 4243.44
friction makes no sense whatsoever

4238.76 --> 4245.56
especially because that friction part

4243.44 --> 4248.0
would happen in the upper atmosphere

4245.56 --> 4250.04
right that's where it's supposed to

4248.0 --> 4254.0
start getting all hot and all that well

4250.04 --> 4254.96
how because it's much less thick up

4254.0 --> 4258.08
there

4254.96 --> 4261.14
there's no sense you know that should

4258.08 --> 4262.91
only happen more down hot yeah how is it

4261.14 --> 4264.410000000001
hot then how is it hot up there what's

4262.91 --> 4266.93
holding that heat I'm pretty sure it's

4264.41 --> 4268.5199999999995
actually colder up there right so it

4266.93 --> 4270.62
makes no damn sense

4268.52 --> 4272.3
and then yeah when it goes down

4270.62 --> 4275.12
eventually it'll stop hitting because

4272.3 --> 4276.56
it's through the thermosphere even

4275.12 --> 4278.39
though there's actually more atmosphere

4276.56 --> 4282.740000000001
there and the effect should be more

4278.39 --> 4288.46
apparent but see none of that makes any

4282.74 --> 4291.83
damn sense except through my method I

4288.46 --> 4295.79
literally found a technical way to a car

4291.83 --> 4297.89
to make an excuse for that thing that

4295.79 --> 4301.55
has been introduced into the globe

4297.89 --> 4304.400000000001
science fiction lore with no real good

4301.55 --> 4307.06
explanation when you think about it it's

4304.4 --> 4307.0599999999995
pretty bizarre

4319.59 --> 4323.8
but I do appreciate it you know I always

4322.15 --> 4325.509999999999
think it's cool about size things like

4323.8 --> 4328.75
who they're going into the atmosphere

4325.51 --> 4331.4490000000005
and they risk burn up I know that makes

4328.75 --> 4335.199
no sense at least from the reasoning

4331.449 --> 4337.299999999999
part that they will give to it if

4335.199 --> 4338.259999999999
somebody even thinks about asking a

4337.3 --> 4340.360000000001
question about it

4338.26 --> 4341.9490000000005
but I still think it's like yeah that's

4340.36 --> 4343.78
kind of cool it's the cool part of

4341.949 --> 4345.73
science fiction I get it's it's a thing

4343.78 --> 4348.79
that happens in science fiction you know

4345.73 --> 4351.549999999999
I accept that but I actually kind of

4348.79 --> 4364.929
figured out a weird way to actually give

4351.55 --> 4367.42
it a reason for being there anyway I'll

4364.929 --> 4369.31
uh I'll explain it sometimes but it's

4367.42 --> 4373.9890000000005
not gonna be on this show not for sure

4369.31 --> 4376.409000000001
not don't expect me to to give it out

4373.989 --> 4376.409
anyway

4377.34 --> 4383.26
although hey you know off air I may

4380.98 --> 4388.75
actually share this information with a

4383.26 --> 4391.360000000001
non baller that I trust not to spread it

4388.75 --> 4395.949
out just to make them think about it and

4391.36 --> 4399.929
to reflect upon how how constructive my

4395.949 --> 4403.9
console is as concerned as a concept

4399.929 --> 4407.11
yeah I'm doing great and doing fantastic

4403.9 --> 4408.129999999999
Akuma virus and like you and Chet

4407.11 --> 4412.049999999999
yesterday

4408.13 --> 4412.05
you're spiraling

4414.4 --> 4421.61
although not as bad as Chris man Chris

4419.24 --> 4425.21
in the ball busters chat just went

4421.61 --> 4427.7
completely nuts he was acting like

4425.21 --> 4432.92
somebody was literally stamping on his

4427.7 --> 4435.8
balls his his testicles he was acting

4432.92 --> 4438.26
like that just spamming out she had an

4435.8 --> 4440.75
insult just couldn't stop but then again

4438.26 --> 4443.33
I was kind of metaphorically and

4440.75 --> 4447.14
spiritually stepping on his balls

4443.33 --> 4449.44
so guess I should have expected that to

4447.14 --> 4449.4400000000005
happen

4454.57 --> 4457.5
all right

4480.61 --> 4483.61
yeah

4490.8 --> 4499.84
okay well come on chat now say thank you

4496.21 --> 4503.9800000000005
to Akuma virus for as you asked

4499.84 --> 4507.1900000000005
saying something [ __ ] because yeah

4503.98 --> 4508.919999999999
that's definitely among something that's

4507.19 --> 4512.5
really dumb thing to say

4508.92 --> 4514.83
so they's Thank You Akuma virus for

4512.5 --> 4514.83
obliging

4528.02 --> 4536.119000000001
[Music]

4547.499 --> 4550.28
okay

4555.719 --> 4564.4800000000005
okay so you know we think that when you

4563.1 --> 4567.21
say oh really

4564.48 --> 4571.5599999999995
Amanda I want to get back to this

4567.21 --> 4573.33
because this is kind of special where is

4571.56 --> 4582.080000000001
he don't turn him out

4573.33 --> 4582.08
oh thank ya what did you say again

4584.509 --> 4593.029
oh right yeah our observable sky doesn't

4588.679 --> 4595.609
fit on a flat earth oh yeah

4593.029 --> 4599.209000000001
apparently he does realize that we think

4595.609 --> 4604.909000000001
that is [ __ ] but I just wondered

4599.209 --> 4608.739
does he really think that that is an

4604.909 --> 4612.469
argument that makes sense anyway

4608.739 --> 4615.888999999999
Akuma fires like are you certain you're

4612.469 --> 4619.509
not actually straw Manning us with that

4615.889 --> 4622.369
statement I'm asking honestly

4619.509 --> 4624.199
anyway I'm I'm gonna go to your PayPal

4622.369 --> 4626.139
by the way Amanda you can thank you so

4624.199 --> 4629.558999999999
much for the $2 super generation

4626.139 --> 4629.559
checking PayPal

4638.829 --> 4646.739
ah nice thank you so much for the 10

4642.52 --> 4646.7390000000005
euros that is awesome

4650.62 --> 4659.05
thank you so much I got nice weather a

4658.15 --> 4663.54
good show

4659.05 --> 4666.4800000000005
loyal audience and some extra money

4663.54 --> 4668.83
awesome

4666.48 --> 4673.349999999999
Thank You Amanda young for your

4668.83 --> 4673.35
continual support I appreciate it a lot

4679.71 --> 4682.859
[Music]

4696.3 --> 4701.4800000000005
well what echo move are what is a real

4699.21 --> 4701.4800000000005
problem

4712.46 --> 4720.7300000000005
you mean your problem is that you know

4714.47 --> 4724.360000000001
us well so that's interesting though

4720.73 --> 4731.089999999999
youth what you asked about this guy I

4724.36 --> 4737.29
asked what's no no you asked Okuma virus

4731.09 --> 4737.29
I was quoting you you brought that up

4743.769 --> 4752.7300000000005
are we getting a little confused already

4748.38 --> 4752.7300000000005
maybe it's a bit too early for you

4763.969 --> 4766.87
okay

4769.729 --> 4774.59
okay so what is your real problem

4772.4 --> 4776.78
because your meta talk now now you're

4774.59 --> 4780.559
saying that the thing you're strong

4776.78 --> 4783.17
meant us with that was my question to

4780.559 --> 4784.9400000000005
you you're saying that it was a real

4783.17 --> 4789.17
problem ten years ago when you first

4784.94 --> 4793.159
came across so how how does your straw

4789.17 --> 4797.869
man claim of how it's not supposed to

4793.159 --> 4800.839999999999
work on the flat earth how yeah how does

4797.869 --> 4803.598999999999
that work you know it's very interesting

4800.84 --> 4805.82
you came across at ten years ago I am

4803.599 --> 4809.84
sure you'd like to imagine that

4805.82 --> 4812.209
but how actually does your argument work

4809.84 --> 4815.679
because it's more like a blank assertion

4812.209 --> 4815.679
and a straw man

4823.95 --> 4827.1089999999995
[Music]

4833.76 --> 4839.7
okay so you do you believe it even

4836.28 --> 4842.55
though you don't really know what it

4839.7 --> 4844.739
actually is even though you claim it's

4842.55 --> 4847.59
very awesome because you came across at

4844.739 --> 4851.4
ten years ago but you can't actually

4847.59 --> 4853.28
explain what it even means and how that

4851.4 --> 4857.639999999999
doesn't work

4853.28 --> 4863.57
it's fascinating a Kumu virus it's great

4857.64 --> 4863.570000000001
I guess we are all used to that from you

4864.38 --> 4871.2300000000005
but mother Salim like he doesn't even

4867.63 --> 4873.6900000000005
know what it means the claim that he

4871.23 --> 4874.98
made he just knows he came up with it

4873.69 --> 4879.98
ten years ago and he thought it was

4874.98 --> 4883.589999999999
awesome then but he can even explain

4879.98 --> 4885.239
elaborate upon the concept he just says

4883.59 --> 4888.96
no it just doesn't fit in there it just

4885.239 --> 4891.15
doesn't fit oh why doesn't it fit he's

4888.96 --> 4894.3
not telling us it's just saying it

4891.15 --> 4897.42
doesn't fit because he has a very

4894.3 --> 4903.78
strange notion of what flat earth is

4897.42 --> 4905.28
like and yeah I'm sure he likes to keep

4903.78 --> 4907.04
it that way you know because if you get

4905.28 --> 4910.41
real with any kind of Flat Earth

4907.04 --> 4912.0
conceptualization then yeah it doesn't

4910.41 --> 4914.97
make you feel all that comfortable about

4912.0 --> 4917.55
your ball anymore so it's a common

4914.97 --> 4921.17
practice for a lot of long-run ballers

4917.55 --> 4924.21
to keep holding on to some kind of weird

4921.17 --> 4927.66
incomplete straw man model of a flat

4924.21 --> 4930.83
earth especially disc ones so they can

4927.66 --> 4934.71
use that and compare that broken-down

4930.83 --> 4938.03
incomplete Flat Earth modeling thing to

4934.71 --> 4941.39
the ball to make the ball look great

4938.03 --> 4941.389999999999
that's what they do

4944.85 --> 4952.150000000001
I'm sure you're very comfortable with

4947.53 --> 4969.929999999999
geometry if only were as comfortable

4952.15 --> 4969.929999999999
with reality a creation bear

4981.46 --> 4984.609
[Music]

4993.35 --> 5000.81
so yeah you got any reason why the sky

4996.68 --> 5007.450000000001
won't fit on the flat earth

5000.81 --> 5010.75
please give your reasoning for it what

5007.45 --> 5014.7699999999995
about the Flat Earth does not allow the

5010.75 --> 5019.41
sky as we see it to fit in it a coma

5014.77 --> 5019.410000000001
virus Katie please respond

5032.949 --> 5039.759999999999
no guarantees but look I tend to not ban

5036.79 --> 5043.87
people just for saying things I tend to

5039.76 --> 5045.969
ban them for diverting and not

5043.87 --> 5047.949
responding and getting into ad homes and

5045.969 --> 5050.26
all that's really the reason why I tend

5047.949 --> 5053.799999999999
to ban people in my chat it happens a

5050.26 --> 5055.6900000000005
lot especially to baller so but hey if

5053.8 --> 5058.6
you're gonna assert something then at

5055.69 --> 5062.23
least give some kind of reason for it

5058.6 --> 5064.09
buddy we don't need a history lesson as

5062.23 --> 5066.91
to how you came to the idea I'd like to

5064.09 --> 5070.06
know what the reason actually is for

5066.91 --> 5074.969
your declaration you know could you

5070.06 --> 5074.969
elaborate maybe come on

5105.06 --> 5114.1
okay so you're not gonna do it because

5108.97 --> 5115.990000000001
if you're gonna ask me one more time if

5114.1 --> 5119.56
I'm not gonna ban you I'm gonna ban you

5115.99 --> 5124.57
just so you know so just throw it out

5119.56 --> 5130.72
there and don't ask me questions just

5124.57 --> 5134.74
throw out the issue you have with your

5130.72 --> 5138.490000000001
concept of a flat earth and why the sky

5134.74 --> 5142.38
does not fit into it and the explanation

5138.49 --> 5143.7699999999995
for such things will not start out with

5142.38 --> 5147.4800000000005
questions

5143.77 --> 5152.280000000001
do you understand the Kumu virus an

5147.48 --> 5154.57
explanation not questions

5152.28 --> 5158.5
especially not some kind of other

5154.57 --> 5160.599999999999
subject type of questions like a math or

5158.5 --> 5162.43
geometry or anything no no no we're

5160.6 --> 5165.370000000001
talking about the Flat Earth model and

5162.43 --> 5168.88
why the sky doesn't fit in that so

5165.37 --> 5173.19
please start with your explanation not

5168.88 --> 5173.1900000000005
with a question okay

5177.82 --> 5181.549999999999
[Music]

5179.36 --> 5183.5
and I don't need a citation there is no

5181.55 --> 5189.71
citation for that ingredient SiC don't

5183.5 --> 5193.16
we that's a reasonable if it's about

5189.71 --> 5198.35
geometry okay so what about geometry

5193.16 --> 5200.69
does not allow this guy to fit in the

5198.35 --> 5203.2300000000005
flat earth realm Akuma virus tell me

5200.69 --> 5206.12
what about geography does not allow it

5203.23 --> 5212.0599999999995
if that is really how you're gonna start

5206.12 --> 5213.98
this out no no no no don't talk to the

5212.06 --> 5221.0
people in chat talk to me I'm talking to

5213.98 --> 5223.37
you yeah and people in chat don't poke

5221.0 --> 5226.78
at him don't distract him I genuinely

5223.37 --> 5226.78
want him to answer

5235.429 --> 5244.309
so Akuma virus what about geometry does

5238.909 --> 5254.478999999999
not allow the sky to fit in the flat

5244.309 --> 5256.249
earth realm please elaborate okay yeah

5254.479 --> 5260.7390000000005
that's really interesting we know we

5256.249 --> 5260.739
know what flat means and yeah

5288.949 --> 5295.3099999999995
yeah that's really nice Akuma virus I

5291.92 --> 5299.12
know what the flat surface means in the

5295.31 --> 5303.7390000000005
implications and yes I understand so how

5299.12 --> 5306.44
does that relate to the sky not fitting

5303.739 --> 5317.989
in the realm this is I don't see this

5306.44 --> 5319.639999999999
leading anywhere is it I don't see I

5317.989 --> 5323.178999999999
don't see that's that I didn't see the

5319.64 --> 5326.469
truth in that statement that means basic

5323.179 --> 5329.35
shapes are flat plain versus 3d sphere

5326.469 --> 5332.96
now that seems like a false dichotomy

5329.35 --> 5334.9890000000005
that presupposes all sorts of things

5332.96 --> 5337.28
sorry no there are definitely other

5334.989 --> 5345.3099999999995
possibilities especially if you consider

5337.28 --> 5345.3099999999995
that space may not be entirely linear so

5345.55 --> 5353.21
yeah stop saying patients just continue

5349.37 --> 5360.38
okay does your flat earth curve no

5353.21 --> 5366.199
doesn't so pretty straight straight flat

5360.38 --> 5368.4490000000005
continual looping in on itself infinite

5366.199 --> 5374.0599999999995
straight line infinite repeating

5368.449 --> 5381.259999999999
straight lines yes singular infinitely

5374.06 --> 5386.3
repeating straight line yeah yeah the

5381.26 --> 5389.14
earth is definitely a plane in geometry

5386.3 --> 5391.820000000001
what look we're not talking about

5389.14 --> 5394.01
geometrical conceptualizations okay

5391.82 --> 5399.62
we're talking about the actual physical

5394.01 --> 5405.8
earth realm so I don't see how geometry

5399.62 --> 5409.4
makes it impossible for the sky to fit

5405.8 --> 5413.78
in the flat earth realm can you please

5409.4 --> 5416.0599999999995
move it along a little anyway don't tie

5413.78 --> 5417.949
them out people if you tie them out I'm

5416.06 --> 5421.13
gonna take your wrench

5417.949 --> 5423.82
I'm gonna take a a break just see what

5421.13 --> 5423.82
it puts down

5531.47 --> 5537.83
okay let's see what he put out

5551.98 --> 5555.259999999999
[Music]

5557.79 --> 5563.46
what yeah we perceive 3d because we have

5561.57 --> 5571.95
two eyes yes that's what the last

5563.46 --> 5574.38
perspective the but it yeah it's not

5571.95 --> 5578.79
really the reason we see 3d though you

5574.38 --> 5581.61
know we have we see 3d because physical

5578.79 --> 5585.66
reality is 3d that's really the reason

5581.61 --> 5589.2
why we see that no but we see an extra

5585.66 --> 5590.5199999999995
added perspective into that 3d because

5589.2 --> 5597.99
we have two eyes so you got that

5590.52 --> 5602.1900000000005
technically wrong Okuma virus we see 3d

5597.99 --> 5604.679999999999
because the world is 3d not because we

5602.19 --> 5607.58
have two eyes thank you

5604.68 --> 5607.58
mix that up a little

5615.159 --> 5619.119
so that's fine it doesn't matter if you

5617.169 --> 5633.459
were talking to me if I'm correcting you

5619.119 --> 5638.789
anyway all right so I'm having the

5633.459 --> 5638.789
unfortunate realization that my inquiry

5639.119 --> 5644.469
to become a virus to give me some kind

5642.159 --> 5647.829
of reason as to why this skit the sky

5644.469 --> 5651.88
can't fit in the Flat Earth realm is not

5647.829 --> 5655.709
gonna get an answer it's just talking

5651.88 --> 5660.999
about other nonsense now and comparing

5655.709 --> 5663.07
geometry things that have no consequence

5660.999 --> 5666.55
is a reality really and it's not even

5663.07 --> 5669.639
addressing anything concerning sky or

5666.55 --> 5672.369000000001
gas I guess this is what's gonna be part

5669.639 --> 5674.349
of that or lights or anything physical

5672.369 --> 5676.659
now it's just talking about geometry and

5674.349 --> 5680.05
comparing shapes and this is not gonna

5676.659 --> 5689.879999999999
lead to any kind of evidence why a sky

5680.05 --> 5689.88
cannot fit in a flat earth realm this I

5691.079 --> 5700.869
knew it it that's it isn't it so your

5696.669 --> 5703.179
reason the sky cannot fit in the flat

5700.869 --> 5710.11
earth realm is because you are assuming

5703.179 --> 5714.789
it is a literal sphere surrounding this

5710.11 --> 5717.13
the realm in a literal way and then your

5714.789 --> 5719.11
conclusion it must be a globe otherwise

5717.13 --> 5721.119
it makes no sense right well why don't

5719.11 --> 5723.699
you step away from that physicality

5721.119 --> 5726.28
assumption bias that these lights in

5723.699 --> 5730.869
Evans are a literal sphere to begin with

5726.28 --> 5734.65
because that's a presupposition you're

5730.869 --> 5738.369
just assuming that they are a literal

5734.65 --> 5744.219
sphere of things that surround you Akuma

5738.369 --> 5747.308999999999
virus those lights are not the sky do

5744.219 --> 5755.9800000000005
you understand the sky is air

5747.309 --> 5758.889
the sky is a space a confined space with

5755.98 --> 5762.579
air in it that does things and moves and

5758.889 --> 5765.28
can change temperature that's the sky in

5762.579 --> 5768.759999999999
are those lights you see including the

5765.28 --> 5772.239
Sun here's the big mind twister they're

5768.76 --> 5777.309
not part of the sky we just happen to

5772.239 --> 5779.709999999999
see them they're right they're not

5777.309 --> 5783.4800000000005
physical objects in any position they

5779.71 --> 5787.119
have no consequences as to the

5783.48 --> 5789.009999999999
orientation of what is physically

5787.119 --> 5793.119
transpiring within the realm

5789.01 --> 5799.75
besides the light interaction with the

5793.119 --> 5803.0199999999995
surface okay so I guess that was that it

5799.75 --> 5807.73
yeah I knew it and I should have known

5803.02 --> 5810.329000000001
it when people like a Kumu virus say the

5807.73 --> 5814.36
sky can't fit in the Flat Earth model

5810.329 --> 5816.639
it means sticks in the ground because it

5814.36 --> 5821.589999999999
has to be that's pretty much what it

5816.639 --> 5823.72
means I should have known hello well you

5821.59 --> 5827.1
know you can always hope

5823.72 --> 5827.1
[Music]

5834.31 --> 5844.63
[Music]

5836.05 --> 5849.77
it's well how about nothing is moving

5844.63 --> 5852.74
how about that how about the light angle

5849.77 --> 5855.9800000000005
is changing there is no physical thing

5852.74 --> 5859.19
moving Akuma virus there's not a choice

5855.98 --> 5862.429999999999
between the sky and the earth just

5859.19 --> 5865.19
because you see lights move because you

5862.43 --> 5872.860000000001
see some lights angle change there is no

5865.19 --> 5872.86
physical motion happening like Omo virus

5873.7 --> 5883.04
yeah but there is not a thing moving the

5880.04 --> 5887.38
light angle what you see is moving there

5883.04 --> 5887.38
is no physical thing moving

5895.119 --> 5900.879
did what we you don't need my argument

5898.959 --> 5905.05
no light angle change not needed what

5900.879 --> 5906.699
really you don't you just gonna put that

5905.05 --> 5908.079000000001
on the side that I'm just saying no it's

5906.699 --> 5909.969
not a physical thing it's just the

5908.079 --> 5910.869
lighting you don't need that of course

5909.969 --> 5914.349
you don't need it if you're gonna

5910.869 --> 5916.869
presuppose the earthís of the glow in

5914.349 --> 5918.939
between a ball of stars right yeah I

5916.869 --> 5920.499
know I know you don't need that you

5918.939 --> 5922.570000000001
don't need that argument it's just the

5920.499 --> 5926.438999999999
light angle I know you don't need it but

5922.57 --> 5940.959
I'm gonna use it anyway you know cuz

5926.439 --> 5943.419
it's right it's true we don't need the

5940.959 --> 5947.559
light to have an angle it's you just

5943.419 --> 5950.019
need you need me to presuppose it's a

5947.559 --> 5951.4890000000005
ball of stars and yeah and then you're

5950.019 --> 5953.379
flattered certainly doesn't make sense

5951.489 --> 5955.749
anymore right if it's a flat disk in

5953.379 --> 5957.999
module that ball of stars right right oh

5955.749 --> 5960.34
yeah that's because you're assuming it

5957.999 --> 5964.389
is a literal ball of stars and we're in

5960.34 --> 5966.07
between it physically that's the problem

5964.389 --> 5970.8
to begin with that that's been the

5966.07 --> 5970.799999999999
problem from the start si como virus

5977.76 --> 5980.85
[Music]

5987.41 --> 5995.21
oh you don't so my what I said that the

5993.29 --> 5998.75
assertion that the lights and their

5995.21 --> 6001.3
angles are not physically literally in a

5998.75 --> 6008.02
physical position in relation to one

6001.3 --> 6011.38
another and the earth that that's not

6008.02 --> 6014.8
what you're presupposing are you I think

6011.38 --> 6017.62
you are I think that is like the the

6014.8 --> 6021.570000000001
entry angle to your entire form of

6017.62 --> 6025.3
reasoning here you are definitely

6021.57 --> 6026.98
presupposing that that's your baseline

6025.3 --> 6030.22
assertion it's what your starting point

6026.98 --> 6032.53
for your reasoning not a done if it

6030.22 --> 6034.6900000000005
matters to me well you're using it so

6032.53 --> 6037.719999999999
whether you care about using it or not

6034.69 --> 6044.259999999999
you are doing it doesn't matter if you

6037.72 --> 6047.5
care about it you are you see no no you

6044.26 --> 6049.8
are I just explained why like three

6047.5 --> 6049.8
times

6055.64 --> 6065.08
I can in sync that's nice

6065.71 --> 6073.19
no I didn't explain it wrong your entire

6070.16 --> 6075.889999999999
starting point was that the sky doesn't

6073.19 --> 6078.259999999999
fit in the Flat Earth realm and your

6075.89 --> 6080.09
explanation for it is that it's a ball

6078.26 --> 6081.77
of stars and it doesn't make sense if

6080.09 --> 6084.38
there's a flat earth in between it all

6081.77 --> 6088.39
that's literally your argument that was

6084.38 --> 6091.9400000000005
your reason for your starting point the

6088.39 --> 6093.740000000001
Buddy that was your argument doesn't

6091.94 --> 6096.349999999999
matter if you don't care I didn't get it

6093.74 --> 6097.09
wrong that's what you did it's all on

6096.35 --> 6100.76
record

6097.09 --> 6102.38
visually two places in the top in the

6100.76 --> 6105.6
chat of YouTube whatever they're gonna

6102.38 --> 6106.66
do it and record it in the video itself

6105.6 --> 6110.81
[Music]

6106.66 --> 6113.08
so yeah you did do that absolutely you

6110.81 --> 6113.080000000001
did

6125.11 --> 6134.759999999999
okay it's time it's time to end this I'm

6129.55 --> 6134.76
not gonna deal with a nah-ah argument

6135.0 --> 6139.25
leave whatever the [ __ ] you want man

6137.23 --> 6141.2699999999995
just go away

6139.25 --> 6143.98
[Music]

6141.27 --> 6148.540000000001
I'm not gonna now I'm not gonna ban you

6143.98 --> 6151.66
it just just shut up if you're gonna

6148.54 --> 6153.93
just say now then just shut up get out

6151.66 --> 6153.93
here

6194.09 --> 6199.59
you made an assertion it doesn't matter

6197.429 --> 6201.3
I just if you're gonna make an assertion

6199.59 --> 6203.4890000000005
then you're gonna put down how that

6201.3 --> 6206.149
works and when you do I'm gonna point

6203.489 --> 6209.28
out how you were wrong and exactly why

6206.149 --> 6212.939
and you can say nah to all of that all

6209.28 --> 6215.459
day long you want you can keep keep the

6212.939 --> 6218.849
mantra for yourself but it's there

6215.459 --> 6222.119
the reasoning is there the history is

6218.849 --> 6225.149
there your performance is there on

6222.119 --> 6227.969
record so yeah you can sputter all you

6225.149 --> 6229.669000000001
want it's not gonna help you you said

6227.969 --> 6233.13
what you said you did what you did

6229.669 --> 6235.739
I'm not hammering you on supposedly

6233.13 --> 6239.039
claiming science which I haven't right

6235.739 --> 6244.07
so there's not an argument and I don't

6239.039 --> 6247.259999999999
need to know how careful and apparently

6244.07 --> 6248.969
modest you were trying to be now if

6247.26 --> 6251.189
you're gonna make an assertion then I

6248.969 --> 6254.599
want you to back up that assertion so I

6251.189 --> 6259.019
can point out how you were wrong and why

6254.599 --> 6260.669
see that's how it works I don't need a

6259.019 --> 6262.979
claim of science to break down your

6260.669 --> 6266.84
arguments I just need you to open your

6262.979 --> 6266.84
mouth and I'll do the rest

6276.95 --> 6286.17
[Music]

6282.83 --> 6289.44
no I don't blame you no no it's okay

6286.17 --> 6292.56
it's okay don't don't get triggered come

6289.44 --> 6296.339999999999
virus I'm happy that you actually tried

6292.56 --> 6297.05
to answer it you know it's okay it's

6296.34 --> 6303.09
okay

6297.05 --> 6307.070000000001
you're not in danger it's okay but yeah

6303.09 --> 6312.21
the assertion was still pretty stupid so

6307.07 --> 6314.94
yeah it's just what it is but I do

6312.21 --> 6315.39
appreciate that you at least tried you

6314.94 --> 6326.28
know

6315.39 --> 6334.14
that's worth something I guess okay well

6326.28 --> 6336.45
look that's I don't get it why if you

6334.14 --> 6338.88
don't want to do it then why would you

6336.45 --> 6341.91
put out an assertion like that why would

6338.88 --> 6344.400000000001
you say something if you can't back up

6341.91 --> 6346.38
your own statement why would you use it

6344.4 --> 6350.58
if you can't do if you can't use it it's

6346.38 --> 6352.29
like bringing a weapon to a fight when

6350.58 --> 6357.5599999999995
you don't know how to handle the weapon

6352.29 --> 6357.56
it's it seems kind of pointless you know

6359.84 --> 6367.76
oh okay well don't really appreciate

6366.05 --> 6369.26
that but that's fine

6367.76 --> 6374.38
if you thought you were just playing

6369.26 --> 6378.2
with y'all that's okay you know

6374.38 --> 6381.08
just know that your play we did result

6378.2 --> 6383.54
in us basically dissecting you piece by

6381.08 --> 6386.15
piece your mind that is what's left of

6383.54 --> 6388.04
it so yeah that's that's nice that you

6386.15 --> 6390.65
you thought you were playing with us but

6388.04 --> 6395.39
yeah you were actually sitting in

6390.65 --> 6397.3099999999995
surgery getting your brain analyzed by

6395.39 --> 6399.77
people who do know how things really

6397.31 --> 6401.75
work but that's okay you can you can

6399.77 --> 6404.14
think of that you were playing with us

6401.75 --> 6404.14
that's okay

6436.49 --> 6439.688999999999
[Music]

6442.21 --> 6448.28
yeah sorry I lost interest I'm gonna

6445.46 --> 6453.89
ignore you now I've gave you enough

6448.28 --> 6459.74
attention already we got 10 more minutes

6453.89 --> 6465.76
I think yeah so anything else people

6459.74 --> 6465.76
want to talk about what else happens

6475.75 --> 6482.38
alright yeah watch more Star Trek but

6478.56 --> 6484.39
it's weird I even I guess other people

6482.38 --> 6486.58
are watching Star Trek the old series as

6484.39 --> 6491.160000000001
well because I heard somebody flatter

6486.58 --> 6495.43
discord their partner was watching it I

6491.16 --> 6498.25
saw an episode yesterday that I thought

6495.43 --> 6501.52
was pretty like mind-blowing to hear

6498.25 --> 6505.18
that it's an episode that is probably

6501.52 --> 6507.790000000001
very famous but I had never seen it I

6505.18 --> 6509.89
just seen the movie that came out of it

6507.79 --> 6516.1
which is like the most famous Star Trek

6509.89 --> 6520.780000000001
movie that is yeah it's an episode where

6516.1 --> 6522.85
Khan they yeah see movie is so popular

6520.78 --> 6526.57
they're like The Revenge of Khan and

6522.85 --> 6528.610000000001
they even in the reboot try to do it

6526.57 --> 6532.45
again in another way it was halfway

6528.61 --> 6535.12
decent i guess maybe people disagree but

6532.45 --> 6544.51
i saw the original episode with that guy

6535.12 --> 6547.33
and holy [ __ ] they put down some really

6544.51 --> 6550.6900000000005
weird predictions in there man like

6547.33 --> 6554.26
really freaky had anybody heard that

6550.69 --> 6560.95
they said like yeah when the world was

6554.26 --> 6564.1900000000005
taken over by like nazi supermen in 1994

6560.95 --> 6568.83
and they took control of 2/3 of the

6564.19 --> 6573.37
world and like holy [ __ ]

6568.83 --> 6577.69
when i said but just hearing exactly

6573.37 --> 6580.96
like how they put that out was like dude

6577.69 --> 6585.79
you you gotta like see that again just

6580.96 --> 6589.06
to see what they said about it there was

6585.79 --> 6590.71
like some predictive programming

6589.06 --> 6593.410000000001
placement in there even though like the

6590.71 --> 6595.87
dates probably are slightly off or it's

6593.41 --> 6598.15
it's not exactly like that but it was

6595.87 --> 6602.44
still pretty fascinating like they put

6598.15 --> 6603.969999999999
such an elaborate time-stamped situation

6602.44 --> 6606.0
in our past in there

6603.97 --> 6611.13
it's like what

6606.0 --> 6613.08
ah Thank You Amanda young for the $2

6681.39 --> 6688.68
some of the scenes in that episode again

6683.52 --> 6692.13
to maybe make some notes because they

6688.68 --> 6694.14
literally put like a whole period and

6692.13 --> 6697.47
they were also talking about world

6694.14 --> 6699.990000000001
government and like individuals taking

6697.47 --> 6704.04
over power that were getting very

6699.99 --> 6710.28
hostile to wonder I'm serious guys there

6704.04 --> 6711.99
was like a whole set of crazy elaborate

6710.28 --> 6715.29
