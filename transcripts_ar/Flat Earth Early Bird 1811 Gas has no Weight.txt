5.39 --> 28.29
[Music]

28.96 --> 36.67
look

31.9 --> 36.67
[Music]

58.92 --> 64.36
a

60.92 --> 65.96000000000001
good morning welcome to Flat Earth early

64.36 --> 69.36
bird number

65.96 --> 71.03999999999999
1811 I'm your host AR win and before

69.36 --> 73.96
start the show please don't forget to

71.04 --> 76.64
share it on any platform you deem fit

73.96 --> 79.119
and if you haven't already subscribe to

76.64 --> 81.43900000000001

83.4 --> 88.04
weekdays and 2: p.m. Amsterdam time in

85.52 --> 90.6
the weekend and please also do support

88.04 --> 92.399
me through the PayPal and the pat

90.6 --> 94.119
that'll be much appreciated and it can

92.399 --> 96.119
always use the

94.119 --> 100.92
support

96.119 --> 104.28
right so weather today is kind of

100.92 --> 107.32000000000001
Stormy there a lot of wind blowing has

104.28 --> 107.32000000000001
been pretty much all

107.88 --> 112.56
night clouds are I don't

114.64 --> 121.6
know it's kind of weird

118.0 --> 124.2
I'm when I look over there I see the

121.6 --> 127.0
clouds go that way when I look over

124.2 --> 128.8
there I see the cloud go that way I

127.0 --> 132.28
don't get

128.8 --> 135.519
it so whatever is going on there's a lot

132.28 --> 138.0
of movement happening

135.519 --> 140.20000000000002
and I don't really get how the cloud can

138.0 --> 140.2
be

140.76 --> 147.07999999999998
going oh of course unless it's all going

144.76 --> 150.56
that way and then it's perspective

147.08 --> 152.959
that's making it look like that right

150.56 --> 156.12
can't really tell too much with like a

152.959 --> 159.239
big cloud

156.12 --> 162.239
pack so I guess the wind is

159.239 --> 162.239
going

165.959 --> 170.599
south all right

176.44 --> 183.92
anyhow huh L dupons first in in chat

181.4 --> 183.92000000000002
good to see

184.56 --> 194.36
you it is Thursday the 21st of December

190.879 --> 196.67999999999998
2023 yeah was no show

194.36 --> 201.20000000000002
yesterday yeah just didn't really work

196.68 --> 203.44
out and I was really up for just a day

201.2 --> 206.35999999999999
off

203.44 --> 208.28
anyway because I was just really tired

206.36 --> 211.68
and it did help a lot I feel a lot

208.28 --> 211.68
better and more focused

217.68 --> 223.20000000000002
huh oh that's interesting derer yeah

220.76 --> 226.48
yeah before

223.2 --> 228.48
the atomic system there was elements

226.48 --> 232.04
that's

228.48 --> 236.959
right and technically elements is pretty

232.04 --> 236.959
much the same it's just that atomism

237.76 --> 241.67999999999998
gave more empiric

242.439 --> 250.959
fill in to it but yeah I mean classical

246.48 --> 250.959
elements are basically what have

252.04 --> 256.799
become

254.72 --> 259.759
atoms and the

256.799 --> 263.88
elements right I mean they're called the

259.759 --> 263.88
elements atoms like in

264.199 --> 269.24
the in the book in the chemistry book

267.12 --> 270.32
what's it I always forget the periodic

269.24 --> 272.56
table

270.32 --> 276.15999999999997
another word for that is the elements

272.56 --> 276.16
that's that's still

276.52 --> 283.15999999999997
valid it's for it's for a reason duper

280.52 --> 285.19899999999996
anyway

283.16 --> 288.68
interesting it's good that you're just

285.199 --> 291.0
doing this kind of research or digging

288.68 --> 291.0
into

298.56 --> 303.599
things

300.47 --> 303.59900000000005
[Music]

307.36 --> 313.6
all right so it would apply mostly to

310.36 --> 315.68
like things like chemistry

313.6 --> 318.759
where ancient

315.68 --> 321.0
times they would just say like yeah if

318.759 --> 323.039
you have this much of this and this much

321.0 --> 326.319
much of that that will happen it will

323.039 --> 328.479
react and this will have come out of it

326.319 --> 332.03900000000004
and then they would just like say yeah

328.479 --> 336.68
that's the element in this and the

332.039 --> 336.68
element of that in that and that does

339.28 --> 346.67999999999995
it so like that kind of element thinking

343.56 --> 347.919
is like a very rough model that's

346.68 --> 350.72
Unleashed

347.919 --> 355.4
upon empirical

350.72 --> 355.40000000000003
experimentation with chemicals and

358.08 --> 363.919
materials and then later it's just

361.6 --> 367.49
worked out and figured out in much more

363.919 --> 368.71999999999997
detail and that is what became

367.49 --> 372.16
[Music]

368.72 --> 372.16
chemistry all right

373.68 --> 377.96
anyway yeah five elements

380.479 --> 385.599
right yeah so it's the Four Element

383.0 --> 391.4
ether added later not really though I

385.599 --> 391.4
think ether was added very quick

394.0 --> 397.199
it's like elusive

405.8 --> 411.24
components so there's I mean it's pure

409.28 --> 412.88
speculation but there's a good chance

411.24 --> 415.599
that

412.88 --> 417.759
anything that would be like gaseous and

415.599 --> 419.639
completely

417.759 --> 422.199
unexpected well that is very very

419.639 --> 424.8
elusive like you literally can't see

422.199 --> 426.68
what's happening then and then they

424.8 --> 430.199
would attribute that to Ether because

426.68 --> 433.72
technically ether in ancient times was

430.199 --> 437.52000000000004
air was anything gas

433.72 --> 442.59900000000005
related it specifically the

437.52 --> 442.599
invisible or what is invisible mostly

444.36 --> 453.91900000000004
gas so they would attribute

448.319 --> 456.72
gous effects to Ether logically within

453.919 --> 456.71999999999997
like the element

459.039 --> 465.44
system although air is yeah that's also

463.16 --> 465.44
but I

467.039 --> 475.12
mean that's a good point

470.759 --> 475.12
actually ether was air

475.759 --> 481.319
then why did they have

478.319 --> 481.319
air

484.24 --> 489.479
H yeah maybe duper I don't know about

499.44 --> 508.039
that Four Seasons and there's more than

502.4 --> 508.039
four senses okay definitely

508.24 --> 511.24
more

516.519 --> 522.12
and then you have North East Southwest

519.88 --> 522.12
of

523.2 --> 526.72
course but

524.83 --> 529.64
[Music]

526.72 --> 533.76
uh where's everybody is this just the

529.64 --> 533.76
duper poons and Arwin show

538.2 --> 541.2
now

543.839 --> 549.9590000000001
am I referring to the third

546.68 --> 555.399
eye well logically if there were four

549.959 --> 555.399
elements then ether would not be just

556.04 --> 562.0
air right so in that

559.12 --> 564.48
sense they might have said like visions

562.0 --> 568.88
and dreams were like

564.48 --> 572.5600000000001
ether like elaborate things that that

568.88 --> 574.6
were untraceable except by the the

572.56 --> 579.399
Mind's Eye as it

574.6 --> 579.399
were so dreams and visions

581.36 --> 588.399
and Consciousness itself perhaps

584.839 --> 590.8800000000001
even right so it's like ether could be

588.399 --> 593.36
like oh that's our spirit or it's our

590.88 --> 597.24
Consciousness

593.36 --> 597.24
or the dream

598.12 --> 602.64
stuff something like that I can

603.6 --> 608.8000000000001
imagine and yeah it's all imagination at

606.36 --> 612.32
this point just pure speculation but I

608.8 --> 614.24
mean why not oh how dare you speculate

612.32 --> 617.5600000000001
all these things have been written about

614.24 --> 619.0
it yeah yeah yeah whatever man I mean

617.56 --> 620.92
what you think that those people that

619.0 --> 626.12
wrote those things I mean there were

620.92 --> 628.56
probably good re researchers and adapted

626.12 --> 631.32
but they probably still made a whole

628.56 --> 634.3599999999999
bunch of up based on their contemporary

631.32 --> 637.36
input okay

634.36 --> 639.88
so just because somebody else wrote

637.36 --> 642.48
about it in a book doesn't mean that

639.88 --> 642.48
they got it

653.519 --> 656.8
better right

658.04 --> 661.04
anyway

665.2 --> 670.9200000000001
was there any kind of like thing you

667.8 --> 671.92
wanted to get into or something with the

670.92 --> 674.079
five

671.92 --> 676.5999999999999
elements duper other than just

674.079 --> 676.5999999999999
mentioning

687.959 --> 690.959
them

691.05 --> 694.15
[Music]

717.959 --> 720.959
yeah

723.16 --> 727.0
hey flatter stage good to see you how

725.6 --> 730.519
you doing

727.0 --> 730.519
man it's been a

740.85 --> 750.88
[Music]

747.88 --> 750.88
while

752.28 --> 755.73
[Music]

758.16 --> 767.199
ah ah right you're going to your dad for

762.199 --> 767.199
the holidays for Christmas yeah that's

777.839 --> 780.839
awesome

782.38 --> 786.57
[Music]

802.76 --> 809.48
H that's interesting

805.76 --> 812.16
der right so I guess arist is

809.48 --> 814.279
responsible for all this ether nonsense

812.16 --> 816.76
sounds like because what you're just

814.279 --> 820.8389999999999
describing there sounds a lot

816.76 --> 824.72
like what the etherians basically are

820.839 --> 828.839
doing right an elusive Heavenly

824.72 --> 828.839
substance kind of thing

837.759 --> 841.759
yeah

839.6 --> 846.5600000000001
36,000 ft

841.759 --> 850.72
Jesus that's very high but yeah it's

846.56 --> 850.7199999999999
flat Earth is definitely

859.9 --> 865.049
[Music]

866.44 --> 870.6800000000001
flat right

872.56 --> 877.16
but that's interesting way to put it if

875.36 --> 878.839
Aristotle really like looked at the

877.16 --> 883.079
heavens and thought like hey that stuff

878.839 --> 886.0400000000001
isn't changing it must be different well

883.079 --> 888.199
he was right they are different

886.04 --> 892.4399999999999
Aristotle actually now that yeah now

888.199 --> 896.199
that I ReRe that second part there

892.44 --> 899.1600000000001
duper Aristotle was

896.199 --> 904.0
right not saying that the celestial are

899.16 --> 904.0
ether or anything but they are

905.92 --> 911.199
unchanging and it's different like I

908.56 --> 912.4399999999999
think it's not even physical at all I

911.199 --> 918.199
think they're

912.44 --> 921.5600000000001
Holograms well a hologram would be

918.199 --> 921.56
something light

925.32 --> 932.1600000000001
based and yeah just think about it

928.68 --> 935.7589999999999
there's no real classification for

932.16 --> 939.6
light in the elements although it could

935.759 --> 941.16
be attributed to fire I guess yeah but

939.6 --> 943.0
still yeah but that's the whole point

941.16 --> 945.959
about the elements it's kind of an

943.0 --> 948.68
oversimplification of things you can

945.959 --> 950.6389999999999
then categorize certain things to

948.68 --> 952.92
certain elements but I mean it's still

950.639 --> 952.92
kind of

957.6 --> 960.6
sloppy

981.519 --> 986.44
yeah thanks for that duper please don't

983.639 --> 988.92
please don't spam quotes that would be

986.44 --> 992.48
great hey if you can just par phrase

988.92 --> 992.4799999999999
some things that would be fine as

1001.38 --> 1004.45
[Music]

1017.48 --> 1020.48
well

1025.13 --> 1029.5200000000002
[Music]

1027.36 --> 1032.52
yeah I got a illuminati croissant still

1029.52 --> 1035.9189999999999
in the oven I should probably get

1032.52 --> 1038.199
it I think I'm going to do that now be

1035.919 --> 1038.199
right

1047.4 --> 1050.4
back

1089.09 --> 1095.4599999999998
[Music]

1099.12 --> 1101.559
and I'm

1107.32 --> 1110.32
back

1111.88 --> 1114.999
[Music]

1115.2 --> 1121.76
H ofrs require a great deal of energy oh

1117.96 --> 1121.76
so there's not a great deal of energy is

1127.0 --> 1133.96
there yeah I need the source to project

1129.84 --> 1139.36
complex lighting that's yeah if it was a

1133.96 --> 1143.96
man-made hologram sure flat land

1139.36 --> 1143.9599999999998
well obviously the celestials are not

1144.96 --> 1147.96
man-made

1149.6 --> 1155.08
right no flatter s is not an ether

1158.679 --> 1162.8400000000001
believer don't give [ __ ]

1167.24 --> 1170.24
dude

1183.039 --> 1186.08
yeah dude you're a

1191.559 --> 1199.559
troll I think I'm not a damn

1195.32 --> 1202.48
it no might have mix them up

1199.559 --> 1204.52
there's let me just check let me just

1202.48 --> 1207.52
check my

1204.52 --> 1207.52
own

1211.36 --> 1216.6
videos yeah I think I mixed you up sorry

1214.24 --> 1216.6
about

1226.64 --> 1231.0
that you're Rel ly new

1247.6 --> 1254.7199999999998
right no

1251.039 --> 1254.72
what what are you talking

1257.12 --> 1260.12
about

1268.36 --> 1273.84
I'm not sure what the ether is yeah

1270.44 --> 1278.279
duper that's yeah nobody really knows

1273.84 --> 1278.279
because it's like gravity doesn't really

1287.039 --> 1290.039
exist

1307.039 --> 1313.48
oh

1309.159 --> 1316.3600000000001
really okay veram but I mean Jehovah are

1313.48 --> 1316.3600000000001
Jehovah

1317.039 --> 1323.039
though

1318.559 --> 1326.6789999999999
do you have any experience with Jehovah

1323.039 --> 1329.44
faram cuz there are plenty of people

1326.679 --> 1332.6000000000001
that

1329.44 --> 1334.0
have like even among flat earthers that

1332.6 --> 1336.52
we know

1334.0 --> 1338.12
so yeah but it's not just money it's

1336.52 --> 1342.36
also

1338.12 --> 1345.4799999999998
that nothing really sticks to their mind

1342.36 --> 1345.4799999999998
unless they're like

1345.6 --> 1349.9599999999998
now yeah unless it's part of the

1351.12 --> 1357.12
conditioning right so in a sense yeah

1354.6 --> 1359.039
you could be able to convince them of

1357.12 --> 1361.36
something then they'll get really

1359.039 --> 1364.0
enthusiastic about it but in a few years

1361.36 --> 1367.6789999999999
it'll be just reset and they will forgot

1364.0 --> 1367.679
all well have forgotten all about

1376.0 --> 1382.6
it cuz it's not going to be part of of

1380.12 --> 1382.6
their

1406.64 --> 1409.88
conditioning h

1415.44 --> 1421.88
there is already Source what's the point

1418.48 --> 1421.88
of a hologram

1427.0 --> 1432.32
what yeah but I mean what do you mean

1429.799 --> 1434.52
outside what if it isn't outside what if

1432.32 --> 1437.3999999999999
it's just through I mean it's all

1434.52 --> 1439.48
freaking nonlocal Holograms yeah we

1437.4 --> 1440.919
can't make that why would you then

1439.48 --> 1443.679
assume oh

1440.919 --> 1446.0
so the way these Holograms are

1443.679 --> 1450.48
definitely not like Holograms that we

1446.0 --> 1452.84
make but we're since they are still dedu

1450.48 --> 1454.84
Holograms somehow we're just going to

1452.84 --> 1458.24
assume they're going to work exactly

1454.84 --> 1460.1589999999999
like the Holograms that we make no no

1458.24 --> 1463.24
this is not just some

1460.159 --> 1466.48
device that's concealed

1463.24 --> 1469.52
somewhere within the design of the realm

1466.48 --> 1474.1200000000001
guys it doesn't work like that

1469.52 --> 1477.44
it's not some device of material that is

1474.12 --> 1480.039
creating the celestials okay I think

1477.44 --> 1481.88
it's extra dimensional really I think

1480.039 --> 1484.12
it's the fourth dimension I think it's

1481.88 --> 1487.88
through it's

1484.12 --> 1490.52
a or yeah one way to see it this is

1487.88 --> 1494.8400000000001
going to get kind of like elusive not

1490.52 --> 1499.36
physics related at all okay

1494.84 --> 1502.799
perception so I reason out that this

1499.36 --> 1505.399
entire state of being might be like a

1502.799 --> 1505.399
reduced

1505.44 --> 1513.52
version that allows this realm setup the

1510.48 --> 1516.3600000000001
way it is so it's like reducing it to

1513.52 --> 1517.84
this type of 3D reality is what makes it

1516.36 --> 1522.279
this

1517.84 --> 1525.36
way if we had the veil of the fourth

1522.279 --> 1529.64
dimension released to

1525.36 --> 1533.0
us which is the default state of mind in

1529.64 --> 1534.919
my view like that's actually how it's

1533.0 --> 1536.44
supposed to

1534.919 --> 1539.44
be

1536.44 --> 1542.0800000000002
then things would be

1539.44 --> 1546.559
different and You'

1542.08 --> 1550.96
probably see like a lot more about the

1546.559 --> 1554.12
guy and then maybe they suddenly in the

1550.96 --> 1556.3990000000001
fourth dimension do become lights that

1554.12 --> 1559.12
are actually in an actual position where

1556.399 --> 1560.6399999999999
you could just approach it and like if

1559.12 --> 1564.76
you'd be able to like get there with a

1560.64 --> 1564.76
balloon like be able to put it in your

1565.0 --> 1572.52
hand like see a weirdy Dancy light like

1569.159 --> 1575.159
in a local position where in this normal

1572.52 --> 1576.799
3D reality that's absolutely impossible

1575.159 --> 1579.44
it follows you around everywhere well

1576.799 --> 1581.76
why would it follow you around

1579.44 --> 1584.3990000000001
everywhere because

1581.76 --> 1586.36
it's Out Of

1584.399 --> 1588.84
Reach like

1586.36 --> 1591.799
forever so

1588.84 --> 1593.48
so the only way I could imagine that you

1591.799 --> 1597.96
can reach something that's Out Of Reach

1593.48 --> 1597.96
forever is through fourth

1598.039 --> 1605.24
dimensionally through and back you can't

1601.399 --> 1605.2399999999998
get there through normal spatial

1605.44 --> 1610.72
Dimensions right so yeah sounds maybe a

1608.76 --> 1614.1589999999999
bit hippie dippy or whatever it's an

1610.72 --> 1617.2
older idea it's

1614.159 --> 1618.1200000000001
just dimensional mechanics it's all

1617.2 --> 1620.32
conception

1618.12 --> 1620.32
of

1622.24 --> 1626.96
course hey lva Paul good see

1632.76 --> 1638.48
you right so whenever I say the

1635.44 --> 1641.279
celestials are Holograms it's merely a

1638.48 --> 1644.6
nomer I mean that's not like oh that

1641.279 --> 1649.64
means I'm claiming it's this specific

1644.6 --> 1653.12
device no it's more like hey in contrast

1649.64 --> 1655.6000000000001
to things we can hold in our hands that

1653.12 --> 1658.32
go away and then oh they become smaller

1655.6 --> 1663.36
and close by and they become bigger and

1658.32 --> 1663.36
we see them bigger yeah

1663.6 --> 1668.6789999999999
physical with all those traits that are

1666.159 --> 1670.96
typically of the physical and then you

1668.679 --> 1675.3990000000001
have well what the hell do you have

1670.96 --> 1676.519
beside that besides oh Optical it's just

1675.399 --> 1678.9189999999999
something you

1676.519 --> 1681.36
see

1678.919 --> 1684.1200000000001
well technically yeah it is Optical the

1681.36 --> 1686.32
celestials are purely Optical

1684.12 --> 1689.08
technically but I mean it does not

1686.32 --> 1692.96
explain anything about their

1689.08 --> 1692.96
elusiveness in a physical

1694.32 --> 1701.6399999999999
sense so what the hell do you designate

1697.32 --> 1705.399
that as well I designated it a hologram

1701.64 --> 1705.3990000000001
because it reminded me of a

1706.44 --> 1709.44
hologram

1710.36 --> 1714.9189999999999
like something

1711.76 --> 1717.8799999999999
that's gives you a visual impression of

1714.919 --> 1720.48
something but it's not really there

1717.88 --> 1722.919
that's the Hologram is the only thing

1720.48 --> 1725.96
that actually does anything remotely

1722.919 --> 1729.159
like that okay and that's why I said

1725.96 --> 1732.559
yeah it's a hologram it's not a man-made

1729.159 --> 1738.0390000000002
device thing that's causing

1732.559 --> 1742.1589999999999
that but it's the closest to it of

1738.039 --> 1742.1589999999999
anything that I could figure

1753.159 --> 1758.3990000000001
out that gas has weight no gas does not

1756.159 --> 1758.3990000000001
have

1758.919 --> 1764.64
weight yeah if you oh yeah yeah if you

1762.24 --> 1768.1200000000001
cram gas in a cylinder yeah but it

1764.64 --> 1772.2
doesn't actually have more weight

1768.12 --> 1772.1999999999998
it has weight in a colloquial

1774.12 --> 1780.12
sense

1776.2 --> 1782.0
right but not in a conventional sense do

1780.12 --> 1784.6399999999999
you see

1782.0 --> 1786.519
that so yeah I didn't I kind of forgot

1784.64 --> 1788.519
to mention the colloquial weight it's

1786.519 --> 1790.24
actually like a fourth Branch but it's

1788.519 --> 1792.3990000000001
not really a branch because it's not

1790.24 --> 1794.519
even official classification it's just

1792.399 --> 1797.08
that oh you're cramming in a cylinder

1794.519 --> 1800.039
hey look there is some disequilibrium

1797.08 --> 1801.12
with the medium it gives some pressure

1800.039 --> 1804.399
but that

1801.12 --> 1810.36
pressure which will be translated into a

1804.399 --> 1810.36
weight number is never going to actually

1811.0 --> 1814.919
yield a

1813.279 --> 1818.44
valid

1814.919 --> 1820.279
number that can be directly associated

1818.44 --> 1822.559
with a

1820.279 --> 1824.96
consistent weight of the material

1822.559 --> 1830.32
because it doesn't have any because gas

1824.96 --> 1833.279
doesn't actually have weight gas is not

1830.32 --> 1835.76
weighed in that

1833.279 --> 1838.32
sense right if you have like a bit of

1835.76 --> 1840.6
material like a liquid or a solid yeah

1838.32 --> 1843.08
they weigh that and it's very consistent

1840.6 --> 1845.6
and that's how like industrial standards

1843.08 --> 1849.08
in everything with gases however they

1845.6 --> 1851.039
kind of have to like just use another

1849.08 --> 1856.36
thing they just say like

1851.039 --> 1859.279
no they just put the kilog to the liquid

1856.36 --> 1861.32
compressed version of it cuz when it's

1859.279 --> 1865.399
compressed enough well then you have a

1861.32 --> 1868.32
weight is that weight in proportion

1865.399 --> 1871.84
to the atomic

1868.32 --> 1871.84
weight probably

1873.159 --> 1879.3600000000001
not right you

1875.44 --> 1883.279
can't rely on the disequilibrium

1879.36 --> 1885.399
pressure caused by liquifying gas or

1883.279 --> 1887.639
pressurizing it more in a gas tank and

1885.399 --> 1890.399
then that on the scale giving a little

1887.639 --> 1893.519
bit more weight registered that doesn't

1890.399 --> 1898.0
mean that it's actually proportionally

1893.519 --> 1901.039
weight as in a reliable scale number

1898.0 --> 1903.679
that can be tied in with the atomic

1901.039 --> 1903.679
weight of that

1907.039 --> 1914.48
material yes I know L I started that gas

1911.08 --> 1918.76
cannot have weight I started it on this

1914.48 --> 1921.3990000000001
channel keep bringing it up back up

1918.76 --> 1924.24
nobody else was doing this by the way I

1921.399 --> 1926.1999999999998
was doing this daily not daily but like

1924.24 --> 1928.3990000000001
on a weekly basis brought this up like

1926.2 --> 1930.159
two years ago and nobody else was doing

1928.399 --> 1932.639
it people were having a discussion with

1930.159 --> 1934.72
me but nobody else was actually like

1932.639 --> 1936.399
putting it out there I was kind of

1934.72 --> 1939.799
disappointed by that like why aren't

1936.399 --> 1942.279
more people talking about hey gas has no

1939.799 --> 1944.9189999999999
weight not

1942.279 --> 1949.08
really we get it all now but I was the

1944.919 --> 1949.0800000000002
only one doing those videos

1951.2 --> 1955.48
telling the

1952.32 --> 1957.4399999999998
numpties fair enough although you should

1955.48 --> 1959.159
know better than to tell the numpties

1957.44 --> 1961.2
because they don't

1959.159 --> 1962.7600000000002
listen that's why they're

1961.2 --> 1965.919
numpties

1962.76 --> 1968.919
but you can always keep trying I

1965.919 --> 1968.919
guess

1969.2 --> 1972.319
[Music]

1976.039 --> 1979.039
h

1987.279 --> 1995.399
what what's going on with you Bar

1992.399 --> 1995.399
M

2005.96 --> 2008.96
what

2013.32 --> 2018.12
why is Earth named Earth and not a realm

2015.72 --> 2022.159
or world because it's the

2018.12 --> 2024.4799999999998
name yeah Earth is named after the dirt

2022.159 --> 2024.48
it

2031.58 --> 2034.78
[Music]

2035.96 --> 2038.96
has

2053.76 --> 2060.96
yeah that's right big pig slapper oink

2058.44 --> 2060.96
to

2061.32 --> 2066.52
what yeah gas

2063.8 --> 2068.159
floats unless you contain it and then

2066.52 --> 2070.96
put the

2068.159 --> 2076.399
container on a scale you're not even

2070.96 --> 2076.399
going to register any from gas

2085.44 --> 2090.639
pressure so like effectively out there

2088.399 --> 2093.72
when you put a scale in the air it's not

2090.639 --> 2095.56
going to weigh the weight of the air

2093.72 --> 2097.5989999999997
it's literally going to give a zero

2095.56 --> 2102.96
difference because there's no

2097.599 --> 2102.96
disequilibrium happening to exert that

2104.48 --> 2111.28
pressure anyway I'm G to take a bite on

2107.359 --> 2111.2799999999997
this Illuminati

2123.95 --> 2128.7999999999997
[Music]

2125.8 --> 2128.8
cheers

2136.75 --> 2139.889
[Music]

2141.4 --> 2147.96
yeah it doesn't really matter OVA Paul

2144.52 --> 2151.52
if you compress gas in a

2147.96 --> 2153.599
tank put the tank on the scale it

2151.52 --> 2156.8
doesn't have to be

2153.599 --> 2158.48
liquid it can literally still be gas

2156.8 --> 2161.96
there's some gases that even when you

2158.48 --> 2165.4
compress them they stay gas it's really

2161.96 --> 2167.7200000000003
weird it just becomes really compressed

2165.4 --> 2169.119
gas it's still gases it's not going to

2167.72 --> 2172.2799999999997
turn

2169.119 --> 2174.96
liquid and then it will register a

2172.28 --> 2178.6400000000003
differential on the scale CU it's more

2174.96 --> 2182.76
dense the tanker and the gas than the

2178.64 --> 2185.72
medium it is in it will register more

2182.76 --> 2189.2000000000003
than just the weight of the

2185.72 --> 2191.0
tanker but that extra weight that is

2189.2 --> 2192.2
then registered on the skill is not

2191.0 --> 2195.079
going to be

2192.2 --> 2197.7599999999998
proportional to the

2195.079 --> 2202.319
material but it is going to register

2197.76 --> 2202.3190000000004
something because the old tanker

2202.44 --> 2209.119
everything has become

2205.8 --> 2209.119
more as a

2209.52 --> 2213.34
[Music]

2214.359 --> 2220.04
density would need to see that what who

2217.44 --> 2225.839
are I talking

2220.04 --> 2225.839
to air tanks have strictly dry air

2230.839 --> 2234.119
what yeah

2234.839 --> 2240.52
definitely but I mean when they compress

2237.2 --> 2244.0
air it does actually become liquid you

2240.52 --> 2247.359
can even hear the tanks GL GL

2244.0 --> 2249.28
GL so yeah even when you

2247.359 --> 2252.48
compress the

2249.28 --> 2255.76
air with every piece of gas that's in

2252.48 --> 2259.079
there then it too will become liquid

2255.76 --> 2259.079
when you compress it it

2262.88 --> 2269.52
does right but there are some gases in

2266.839 --> 2271.4
their pure form not in air in between

2269.52 --> 2273.88
air definitely that when you compress

2271.4 --> 2275.64
them they just keep compressing and they

2273.88 --> 2280.839
don't turn into a liquid it's really

2275.64 --> 2284.48
weird and then there's other stuff like

2280.839 --> 2286.64
CO2 that actually doesn't turn into a

2284.48 --> 2290.4
liquid when you compress it it turns

2286.64 --> 2295.04
into a solid literally crystals start

2290.4 --> 2299.079
forming in the tank it's really

2295.04 --> 2301.92
weird and like from that Crystal it

2299.079 --> 2304.5600000000004
directly transforms back into gas when

2301.92 --> 2308.52
there's when the pressure

2304.56 --> 2308.52
lowers it's fascinating

2324.4 --> 2331.6800000000003
no no liquid is not a gas that's the

2329.16 --> 2331.68
entire

2332.88 --> 2338.52
Point liquid and gas are

2339.079 --> 2344.92
States the one state can never be the

2342.359 --> 2344.92
other

2346.16 --> 2351.68
ever it's either one or the other can

2349.52 --> 2354.92
never be

2351.68 --> 2357.2
both can be a combination of both like

2354.92 --> 2362.2000000000003
oh some of it is this and the other is

2357.2 --> 2364.72
that it cannot be both at the same time

2362.2 --> 2369.1189999999997
ever one

2364.72 --> 2373.72
molecule cannot both be gas and liquid

2369.119 --> 2376.0
or solid that's just never logically

2373.72 --> 2376.0
that's

2392.16 --> 2398.839
impossible it's not lighter it's less

2394.599 --> 2402.599
dense than air though hel and hey when

2398.839 --> 2404.24
people say lighter that is colloquially

2402.599 --> 2407.119
dense basically that's what they're

2404.24 --> 2409.319
talking about lighter heavier it's all

2407.119 --> 2411.6400000000003
colloquial

2409.319 --> 2414.2
thinking right so it's not really made

2411.64 --> 2417.16
up their mind whether it is a specific

2414.2 --> 2417.16
pressure based

2418.04 --> 2424.64
weight or like this strength of the

2422.24 --> 2428.359
material itself which would be like

2424.64 --> 2428.359
associated with the density

2429.0 --> 2434.16
right it's just a colloquial designator

2431.92 --> 2434.16
it's

2455.319 --> 2458.319
lighter

2482.319 --> 2487.839
no no it's not

2485.24 --> 2491.9599999999996
lighter

2487.839 --> 2495.7599999999998
lighter is not a a physics terminology

2491.96 --> 2498.28
that's that'll hold ground okay it's

2495.76 --> 2502.8390000000004
less

2498.28 --> 2502.8390000000004
dense helium is less dense than

2502.88 --> 2511.76
air now you might call less dense

2506.56 --> 2511.7599999999998
lighter because you like to just use

2512.16 --> 2516.2799999999997
colloquialisms but if you want to be

2514.079 --> 2520.96
technical then it's absolutely incorrect

2516.28 --> 2520.96
correct to use the word lighter for

2522.68 --> 2528.04
that lighter means more means less dense

2526.96 --> 2532.319
heavier

2528.04 --> 2535.16
means more dense lighter less dense

2532.319 --> 2535.16
heavier more

2539.8 --> 2548.1600000000003
dense right unless you're literally

2542.559 --> 2548.1600000000003
going to compare scale readouts

2551.2 --> 2559.7999999999997
then more or less dense might not be

2554.319 --> 2562.599
relevant it's like oh lighter less total

2559.8 --> 2564.3590000000004
weight right from the scale readout

2562.599 --> 2566.6800000000003
that's a completely different approach

2564.359 --> 2568.7999999999997
though if you're talking about a healing

2566.68 --> 2571.839
balloon a skill is never going to be

2568.8 --> 2575.1600000000003
involved so the only thing you then can

2571.839 --> 2576.72
go by is

2575.16 --> 2578.319
density

2576.72 --> 2582.16
and the information for that is

2578.319 --> 2585.04
available yeah scale scale readouts for

2582.16 --> 2588.04
helium balloons are not

2585.04 --> 2588.04
available

2593.81 --> 2601.0
[Music]

2596.4 --> 2603.2400000000002
yeah I'm going to turn my coffee off be

2601.0 --> 2603.24
right

2605.079 --> 2608.079
back

2635.079 --> 2638.079
for

2665.76 --> 2668.0
hm

2678.2 --> 2684.7599999999998
that's kind of ironic seeking star water

2681.4 --> 2687.52
hello by the way CU science doesn't

2684.76 --> 2687.5200000000004
represent

2688.4 --> 2694.359
anything science is not sentient sence

2692.079 --> 2697.2000000000003
doesn't give presentations it's a method

2694.359 --> 2698.16
that you can follow

2697.2 --> 2701.16
but

2698.16 --> 2703.839
uh I know what you mean

2701.16 --> 2706.319
though hello by the way akumu virus

2703.839 --> 2706.319
welcome

2706.88 --> 2712.839
back the fact gas has weight yeah except

2709.839 --> 2715.44
it absolutely does not have

2712.839 --> 2720.0789999999997
weight

2715.44 --> 2720.079
yeah you can't put gas on a

2720.16 --> 2725.319
scale it's just going to move in all

2722.48 --> 2727.599
directions not down gas does not go down

2725.319 --> 2730.4
go boom boom

2727.599 --> 2733.319
dumbass

2730.4 --> 2736.76
yeah gas moves in all directions but if

2733.319 --> 2740.839
you put a gas tank on a

2736.76 --> 2745.1600000000003
scale and then you fill that gas tank up

2740.839 --> 2747.72
with gas you compress it to much higher

2745.16 --> 2750.839
than atmospheric

2747.72 --> 2753.64
pressure then the scale will

2750.839 --> 2756.24
register some extra

2753.64 --> 2759.1189999999997
weight right it will give another redu

2756.24 --> 2762.72
why because the total

2759.119 --> 2765.2400000000002
equilibrium has been disrupted between

2762.72 --> 2767.9599999999996
the object the gas tank and what's in it

2765.24 --> 2770.0789999999997
and the air that surrounds it the

2767.96 --> 2773.16
equilibrium has

2770.079 --> 2776.44
become further

2773.16 --> 2780.0
apart because the Compressed Gas within

2776.44 --> 2783.52
the tank has made the whole thing even

2780.0 --> 2787.16
more dense on average than the air that

2783.52 --> 2789.96
surrounds it so it's going to then add a

2787.16 --> 2794.3999999999996
little weight but that weight is not

2789.96 --> 2800.44
really proportional to atomic

2794.4 --> 2803.44
weight so it's no longer like molecular

2800.44 --> 2805.7200000000003
weight it's just like yeah you just

2803.44 --> 2809.28
compress gas and this is kind of the

2805.72 --> 2810.7599999999998
readout you get and it's still a stable

2809.28 --> 2812.76
consistent R it's like oh if you

2810.76 --> 2816.6800000000003
pressure this much it will give you like

2812.76 --> 2819.4
a kilogram right it's consistent enough

2816.68 --> 2820.52
for practical use but that readout is

2819.4 --> 2824.48
not

2820.52 --> 2828.92
proportional to any official

2824.48 --> 2831.119
weight that has been attributed to the

2828.92 --> 2833.48
material which would be like atomic

2831.119 --> 2837.8
weight it's not proportional it's just

2833.48 --> 2842.359
some weight just pressure

2837.8 --> 2845.88
not a a stable measurement type of

2842.359 --> 2848.7999999999997
pressure it's just pressure just some

2845.88 --> 2852.6400000000003
wait colloquial wait not wait in

2848.8 --> 2854.44
accordance to the convention just wait

2852.64 --> 2856.359
that that's what it is that's what we're

2854.44 --> 2859.0
talking about here that's where the

2856.359 --> 2859.0
confusion

2874.72 --> 2877.72
lies

2881.04 --> 2886.64
yeah CO2 does indeed go down for a

2883.24 --> 2888.359
little bit until it

2886.64 --> 2891.0789999999997
dissolves

2888.359 --> 2893.96
cuz while it's still kind of

2891.079 --> 2896.8390000000004
concentrated versus the regular air

2893.96 --> 2900.599
outside it is going to be more

2896.839 --> 2903.16
dense than the air outside for a little

2900.599 --> 2907.6400000000003
bit

2903.16 --> 2907.64
Yeah and then it's going to dissipate

2908.52 --> 2913.88
it doesn't stay

2911.24 --> 2915.04
there because gas doesn't go down go

2913.88 --> 2918.96
boom

2915.04 --> 2920.92
boom yeah is it spreads out in all

2918.96 --> 2924.119
directions it just might take a little

2920.92 --> 2926.6800000000003
while but it

2924.119 --> 2928.92
will right but while it's still

2926.68 --> 2930.96
concentrated and hey it can be

2928.92 --> 2932.319
concentrated in a tanker right if you

2930.96 --> 2936.16
separate

2932.319 --> 2938.92
it from the regular air out there

2936.16 --> 2940.839
it's going to stay concentrated right

2938.92 --> 2942.559
and even if you let it out there it's

2940.839 --> 2945.0
going to be concentrated for just a

2942.559 --> 2947.7200000000003
little bit and then while it's

2945.0 --> 2950.319
concentrated it might have a

2947.72 --> 2953.0789999999997
disequilibrium with the other gases

2950.319 --> 2956.88
that's around it for just a little

2953.079 --> 2959.0
bit until it eventually like kind of

2956.88 --> 2963.28
mingles in and then it's just it

2959.0 --> 2963.28
dissipates and it becomes part of the

2964.52 --> 2970.44
mesh gas does not have weight in

2968.16 --> 2974.04
accordance to the

2970.44 --> 2974.04
convention and that's a

2976.24 --> 2984.9599999999996
fact you can never get put gas on a

2980.24 --> 2989.68
scale in any way and get like a logic

2984.96 --> 2994.0
like a consistent atomic weight type of

2989.68 --> 2996.48
result out of that it doesn't work it's

2994.0 --> 2999.48
not even how atomic weight has been

2996.48 --> 3003.119
established most of the time like atomic

2999.48 --> 3006.599
weight with like materials that are

3003.119 --> 3009.079
naturally gaseous and are very hard to

3006.599 --> 3011.7200000000003
even turn liid like let's say hel

3009.079 --> 3011.7200000000003
hydrogen

3012.68 --> 3017.9199999999996
helium like look how much you have to

3015.319 --> 3020.44
compress that stuff just to cause a

3017.92 --> 3023.04
state change that's crazy how much it

3020.44 --> 3023.04
has to be

3024.44 --> 3027.44
compressed

3028.839 --> 3035.52
right well they only established an

3031.839 --> 3037.68
atomic weight after it was no longer in

3035.52 --> 3040.28
a gaseous

3037.68 --> 3045.24
state right because it needs to be

3040.28 --> 3046.799
either liquid or a solid to give

3045.24 --> 3049.1189999999997
a

3046.799 --> 3051.52
stable

3049.119 --> 3054.0
disequilibrium with the

3051.52 --> 3055.44
surrounding yeah because only when the

3054.0 --> 3058.359
dise equilibrium with the surround

3055.44 --> 3061.359
rounding is stable because the material

3058.359 --> 3064.359
isn't just suddenly expanding or

3061.359 --> 3064.359
Contracting

3064.48 --> 3070.839
because it's gas right because the

3068.119 --> 3072.52
density of gas effectively changes

3070.839 --> 3075.96
depending on the

3072.52 --> 3078.319
pressure of it how much of it is there

3075.96 --> 3081.2400000000002
it will like oh it's this density and

3078.319 --> 3084.359
then oh yeah now it's not that density

3081.24 --> 3086.0
anymore it's changed it's

3084.359 --> 3089.88
redistributed

3086.0 --> 3092.079
the volume ratio with the actual M yeah

3089.88 --> 3092.079
with

3092.24 --> 3097.8799999999997
the with I guess the theoretical Mass

3096.0 --> 3100.48
has just dramatically changed so there

3097.88 --> 3102.96
is no thing that can be anchored

3100.48 --> 3104.359
permanently in its gaseous State and

3102.96 --> 3107.319
that's the whole point that's why it

3104.359 --> 3108.2
doesn't have mass and that's why they

3107.319 --> 3110.4
can

3108.2 --> 3114.68
establish atomic

3110.4 --> 3118.4
mass with gas unless they can pressurize

3114.68 --> 3122.319
it cool it down to the point where it

3118.4 --> 3126.559
does become a liquid and then gains that

3122.319 --> 3129.079
linear reliability factor that you need

3126.559 --> 3132.44
to actually gain some kind of linear

3129.079 --> 3135.1600000000003
weight system out of it yeah a

3132.44 --> 3138.76
consistent where the quantity of it is

3135.16 --> 3138.7599999999998
going to be consistent

3139.52 --> 3145.16
numerically right so you can create a

3142.52 --> 3148.559
linear weight system out of it it has to

3145.16 --> 3151.16
be liquid or solid if a material was

3148.559 --> 3154.3590000000004
discovered that could not be made liquid

3151.16 --> 3158.2799999999997
or solid and it's only in its gas State

3154.359 --> 3161.92
then the density of that material will

3158.28 --> 3164.6400000000003
never ever be established or measured

3161.92 --> 3167.96
they would never be able to do

3164.64 --> 3170.1189999999997
it get it they might discover hey

3167.96 --> 3173.599
there's something there it's a different

3170.119 --> 3175.76
chemical or something but like we can't

3173.599 --> 3180.28
make it liquid or solid well then you

3175.76 --> 3182.599
will never ever know the density of you

3180.28 --> 3182.599
never

3183.16 --> 3192.839
will he guys goid yeah yeah just keep

3186.52 --> 3192.839
chanting just just say it now make it

3197.15 --> 3200.289
[Music]

3200.599 --> 3203.599
true

3204.16 --> 3207.16
no

3240.59 --> 3244.039
[Music]

3244.2 --> 3247.2
yeah

3248.4 --> 3255.88
mhm yeah two gs he's got 2 kilog of

3253.2 --> 3259.64
helium and then gas goes down go boom

3255.88 --> 3261.28
boom then because he's a [ __ ] [ __ ]

3259.64 --> 3266.0
lva Paul don't you

3261.28 --> 3269.0400000000004
see flat land is just a [ __ ] [ __ ]

3266.0 --> 3269.04
he could never let it

3270.599 --> 3275.6400000000003
go he's going to go down go boom boom

3285.44 --> 3292.319
forever yes get the [ __ ] out of here

3289.92 --> 3292.319
[ __ ]

3292.799 --> 3298.44
D just keep lying to yourself

3295.31 --> 3298.44
[Music]

3307.04 --> 3310.92
no no gas does not have

3311.72 --> 3318.24
weight I spent yet another 15 minutes

3315.64 --> 3320.48
explaining this it doesn't seem to

3318.24 --> 3323.24
matter how many [ __ ] times I keep

3320.48 --> 3326.079
explaining this there's just a bunch of

3323.24 --> 3330.9199999999996
retards they refuse to learn they're

3326.079 --> 3333.1600000000003
just here to say no you got it wrong you

3330.92 --> 3335.96
got it wrong doesn't matter how many

3333.16 --> 3337.0389999999998
[ __ ] times you explain it in detail

3335.96 --> 3339.96
it's

3337.039 --> 3342.039
wrong and just reassert the same hor

3339.96 --> 3344.48
[ __ ] why because you didn't listen you

3342.039 --> 3348.3190000000004
didn't listen like the other hundreds of

3344.48 --> 3348.319
[ __ ] times I've tried to explain

3354.0 --> 3357.0
it

3362.559 --> 3369.559
no if you want me to post some links for

3365.44 --> 3369.559
you just post them in

3369.68 --> 3373.44
Skype and I'll post

3376.78 --> 3383.119
[Music]

3378.48 --> 3383.119
them I'm going to get my coffee be right

3383.92 --> 3386.92
back

3413.88 --> 3416.88
for

3443.799 --> 3446.799
yeah

3453.4 --> 3458.44
he doesn't understand yeah I know L po I

3460.28 --> 3464.8390000000004
know yeah if you want me to post some

3462.559 --> 3469.039
link

3464.839 --> 3469.0389999999998
then just send it to me over

3469.799 --> 3473.359
Skype I'll post

3473.799 --> 3476.799
it

3493.88 --> 3499.6400000000003
second love thermodynamics describe

3495.96 --> 3499.64
energy not gas behavior oh

3503.72 --> 3506.72
really

3507.64 --> 3514.0789999999997
yeah that's not true well thermodynamics

3511.079 --> 3517.44
doesn't just describe

3514.079 --> 3520.44
heat behavior of heat that's not

3517.44 --> 3520.44
exclusively

3533.72 --> 3536.72
thermodynamics

3560.15 --> 3563.419
[Music]

3563.64 --> 3566.64
man

3571.2 --> 3576.9199999999996
well flatland you know the laws of

3573.319 --> 3579.64
thermodynamics so much well then you

3576.92 --> 3582.0
should know that it's definitely

3579.64 --> 3586.72
included in the laws of thermodynamics

3582.0 --> 3586.72
that gas expands to fill the available

3588.799 --> 3596.64
volume it's like definitely taught in

3592.119 --> 3596.6400000000003
physics where the subject comes up

3598.079 --> 3603.6800000000003
so I don't know why you think that

3600.4 --> 3607.2400000000002
suddenly gas behavior is not involved

3603.68 --> 3611.44
has been taught so

3607.24 --> 3612.5989999999997
like since the beginning of physics

3611.44 --> 3615.0
pretty

3612.599 --> 3617.1600000000003
much so don't know where you're getting

3615.0 --> 3618.559
that maybe you memory hold it or

3617.16 --> 3620.8799999999997
something for

3618.559 --> 3623.559
yourself could be man I mean there's

3620.88 --> 3625.77
memory holding going

3623.559 --> 3628.809

3741.559 --> 3749.2000000000003
water okay thanks for telling me I

3743.599 --> 3749.2000000000003
thought so 21 so it's always a special

3766.2 --> 3770.62
[Music]

3773.359 --> 3776.359
moment

3788.119 --> 3794.6800000000003
oh man that Illumina s really hit the

3790.64 --> 3794.68
spot I'm almost like I want another

3795.24 --> 3801.8799999999997
one oh YouTube is acting

3797.839 --> 3801.88
weird open subscri

3802.24 --> 3809.2
what H okay that's weird yeah I mean

3806.0 --> 3811.359
YouTube keeps freezing on me too keep

3809.2 --> 3813.319
having to refresh my video because it

3811.359 --> 3816.0
just freezes up on me and I don't

3813.319 --> 3816.0
understand even

3825.03 --> 3831.469

[Music]

3893.16 --> 3896.16
you

3896.2 --> 3903.359
man anyway bringing this up this subject

3899.799 --> 3906.559
really does seem to get things rolling

3903.359 --> 3908.119
man I mean no problem with people

3906.559 --> 3910.8390000000004
jumping in to

3908.119 --> 3914.2000000000003
talk when I bring up that gas doesn't

3910.839 --> 3917.48
have weight I mean there it I don't even

3914.2 --> 3917.48
understand why it's so

3917.559 --> 3925.4
triggering like what's supposed to

3920.559 --> 3927.52
be so triggering about it I mean gas

3925.4 --> 3930.48
just doesn't have weight it it it

3927.52 --> 3934.559
doesn't go down go boom boom it doesn't

3930.48 --> 3937.76
just like sit there and press on a scale

3934.559 --> 3937.76
to give you like a

3944.0 --> 3950.839
readout yeah gases don't weigh you don't

3947.359 --> 3956.0389999999998
weigh them you have to put them in a

3950.839 --> 3959.96
container and then if it's a lot more

3956.039 --> 3963.5200000000004
pressurized than the regular air outside

3959.96 --> 3965.559
then it might register a teeny weeny

3963.52 --> 3966.96
little bit of weight that's not going to

3965.559 --> 3968.6400000000003
be a

3966.96 --> 3972.359
usable

3968.64 --> 3974.64
quantity to really figure out any detail

3972.359 --> 3978.119
of it yeah you're not able to use it

3974.64 --> 3980.72
it's not like a a chemically reliable

3978.119 --> 3983.0
number you're going to get from that

3980.72 --> 3987.319
weight

3983.0 --> 3990.079
registry yeah it's not atomic mass

3987.319 --> 3990.079
related

3990.48 --> 3995.839
weight it's just a disequilibrium with

3993.64 --> 3998.72
the surrounding

3995.839 --> 4002.2
air and that will cause it to

3998.72 --> 4002.2
press and that's

4009.0 --> 4015.0
it but I

4011.4 --> 4017.079
mean the chat yesterday was was just or

4015.0 --> 4020.16
like the comment section from

4017.079 --> 4023.2000000000003
yesterday's show like holy or two days

4020.16 --> 4026.5989999999997
ago sorry Tuesday

4023.2 --> 4026.5989999999997
show it's

4027.559 --> 4030.559
crazy

4032.079 --> 4039.6800000000003
ah okay yeah that that's the link I can

4036.359 --> 4042.64
post LV Paul thank you for that I think

4039.68 --> 4042.64
I will repost

4042.92 --> 4045.92
that

4050.039 --> 4056.599
I hope this

4051.24 --> 4056.5989999999997
works wait what oh it's too big

4057.24 --> 4060.24
[ __ ]

4066.079 --> 4069.4
okay wait

4070.359 --> 4074.839
what what the [ __ ] was

4072.92 --> 4076.7200000000003
that

4074.839 --> 4080.2
how

4076.72 --> 4084.0389999999998
is okay no what the

4080.2 --> 4087.359
hell like that's not what I freaking

4084.039 --> 4087.3590000000004
copied that's

4094.92 --> 4102.839
[ __ ] which is copy

4098.96 --> 4105.839
link that's more like

4102.839 --> 4105.839
it

4107.759 --> 4113.52
then behavior of gases another link oh

4110.88 --> 4116.04
from lva pole by the way yeah I think I

4113.52 --> 4119.279
got enough for now

4116.04 --> 4123.4
thanks all right so more about gas

4119.279 --> 4123.400000000001
behavior and how they don't have

4125.159 --> 4130.44
weight and oh no wait I mean second law

4128.239 --> 4132.799
thermodynamics how definitely gas

4130.44 --> 4134.799
behavior is part of Second Law

4132.799 --> 4137.12
thermodynamics think that that's what

4134.799 --> 4137.12
this is

4138.05 --> 4141.289
[Music]

4148.0 --> 4154.719
about we CH cylinder with mg yeah but

4151.6 --> 4158.839
that's colloquial dumb

4154.719 --> 4163.159
[ __ ] flat land you dumb [ __ ] don't you

4158.839 --> 4168.88
get it that weight has nothing to do

4163.159 --> 4172.3589999999995
with the Atomic weights you can't do

4168.88 --> 4175.88
chemistry with the weight that you

4172.359 --> 4177.719
register when you do

4175.88 --> 4182.4800000000005
that get

4177.719 --> 4184.96
it it's not chemically reliable weight

4182.48 --> 4188.959999999999
it's not the atomic weight it's not

4184.96 --> 4191.12
actual weight it's colloquial it's just

4188.96 --> 4192.799
it happens to be a this equilibrium with

4191.12 --> 4194.32
the surroundings so it's going to press

4192.799 --> 4198.88
down

4194.32 --> 4201.759999999999
is not weight scale ratio

4198.88 --> 4206.159000000001
based that's the whole point like that's

4201.76 --> 4210.400000000001
like the point the point of me bringing

4206.159 --> 4213.44
it up for like a thousand freaking

4210.4 --> 4216.719
hours now it must no probably not more

4213.44 --> 4220.48
than a 100 but I mean like so many hours

4216.719 --> 4226.199
of me trying to explain it just for that

4220.48 --> 4228.959999999999
one [ __ ] detail just one

4226.199 --> 4231.919999999999
detail and keeps triggering people you

4228.96 --> 4234.36
just can't get it I don't know why you

4231.92 --> 4234.36
don't get

4234.719 --> 4240.52
it gas doesn't have

4237.8 --> 4245.12
weight that's not weight when you put it

4240.52 --> 4247.400000000001
on a scale that's not weight you're

4245.12 --> 4252.48
measuring it's not

4247.4 --> 4255.12
chemical related weight it's just some

4252.48 --> 4258.12
weight and and you can even then compare

4255.12 --> 4260.239
that some weight to like oh yeah that's

4258.12 --> 4263.5599999999995
the typical weight of a cylinder that's

4260.239 --> 4267.12
full yeah but you don't even know how

4263.56 --> 4270.88
much exactly that really is it's not

4267.12 --> 4274.12
weight it's just that's how much when

4270.88 --> 4276.0
you compress gas that much how how much

4274.12 --> 4279.12
it ends up weighing when you put it on

4276.0 --> 4283.04
the scale yeah that weight has no

4279.12 --> 4287.76
relation to atomic mass or anything like

4283.04 --> 4291.0
that it's not chemically reliable weight

4287.76 --> 4295.159000000001
it's not the density it's not the the

4291.0 --> 4295.159
real wait the

4302.0 --> 4306.4
number it's like

4307.44 --> 4312.5599999999995
different what the hell would you even

4309.48 --> 4315.0
call it maybe just call it gas

4312.56 --> 4317.88
weight that would be kind of funny to

4315.0 --> 4321.719
call it that it would be like yeah it's

4317.88 --> 4325.08
called gas weight but it is literally

4321.719 --> 4328.639
totally not weight because gas doesn't

4325.08 --> 4330.88
actually have weight but like this is

4328.639 --> 4332.56
what happens when you compress it and

4330.88 --> 4335.1990000000005
then you put it on a scale and this is

4332.56 --> 4337.8
what you get out of it you could call

4335.199 --> 4340.159
that gas weight but

4337.8 --> 4341.84
ironically yeah it would be like super

4340.159 --> 4343.96
confusing to do that because it would

4341.84 --> 4345.2390000000005
literally suggest the opposite what is

4343.96 --> 4347.56
actually

4345.239 --> 4349.799999999999
happening but I bet people would just

4347.56 --> 4352.120000000001
call it gas weight nonetheless because

4349.8 --> 4355.159000000001
people are [ __ ] and they keep on

4352.12 --> 4357.679
coming back saying the same hor [ __ ]

4355.159 --> 4360.599999999999
over and over again suggesting that gas

4357.679 --> 4362.92
has weight because they P put a gas tank

4360.6 --> 4362.92
on the

4363.76 --> 4367.84
scale they just can't help

4372.44 --> 4375.44
themselves

4379.639 --> 4383.56
you don't even have to compress it yeah

4381.32 --> 4384.96
yeah you can put uncompressed gas on the

4383.56 --> 4388.56
scale

4384.96 --> 4390.92
yes just and then it will give you a

4388.56 --> 4392.84
reading no it won't give you a reading

4390.92 --> 4395.0
it's because it's an equilibrium with

4392.84 --> 4395.0
the

4395.679 --> 4400.36
surrounding that's the same

4398.0 --> 4401.52
density yeah if it's in its expanded

4400.36 --> 4403.599999999999
State it's going to have the same

4401.52 --> 4405.6
density and very soon after it's going

4403.6 --> 4408.76
to mingle in with all the other gas and

4405.6 --> 4412.56
then you totally will be the same

4408.76 --> 4412.56
there's no more differential at all

4422.719 --> 4431.04
then no PA is just being stubborn that's

4428.48 --> 4435.36
mostly it with Akuma virus Akuma virus

4431.04 --> 4435.36
is really freaking stubborn

4437.76 --> 4443.400000000001
yeah yeah yeah I know dip [ __ ] Akuma

4440.28 --> 4446.599999999999
virus they'll never

4443.4 --> 4448.08
learn I know keep saying the same [ __ ]

4446.6 --> 4449.320000000001
over and over again even though I

4448.08 --> 4453.639
literally

4449.32 --> 4457.719
addressed said [ __ ] over and over again

4453.639 --> 4458.8
again today for the third [ __ ] show

4457.719 --> 4462.28
in a

4458.8 --> 4465.28
row and you still don't get

4462.28 --> 4465.28
it

4465.4 --> 4469.48
yeah you choose to completely

4467.4 --> 4471.679
misunderstand what the [ __ ] it is you

4469.48 --> 4474.12
think you're doing Kum virus that's

4471.679 --> 4475.719
what's happening you don't understand

4474.12 --> 4479.0
what the [ __ ] it is that you're doing

4475.719 --> 4483.52
when you're doing that yeah that

4479.0 --> 4486.719
pressure of the scale is not in

4483.52 --> 4489.080000000001
compor with atomic weight or anything

4486.719 --> 4491.4800000000005
it's just colloquial weight it's just

4489.08 --> 4497.159
some pressure on the

4491.48 --> 4497.159
scale it's not chem Ally reliable

4498.159 --> 4504.638999999999
weight yeah you can't stack it up like a

4501.44 --> 4507.599999999999
bunch of gold bars and then like put a

4504.639 --> 4510.28
direct price to that direct weight and

4507.6 --> 4512.4400000000005
it's always going to be that yeah it's

4510.28 --> 4515.32
all like oh no this Tank's just this

4512.44 --> 4517.44
much compressed and that's how much it

4515.32 --> 4519.759999999999
weighs then

4517.44 --> 4522.799999999999
here and that's kind of what they use

4519.76 --> 4526.08
yeah it's not based on atomic weight

4522.8 --> 4528.6
it's just the industrial colloquial

4526.08 --> 4530.6
weight like oh this is how much it

4528.6 --> 4532.92
weighs when you compress it okay that's

4530.6 --> 4536.400000000001
safe okay that's how much we use and

4532.92 --> 4538.56
it's just like yeah one tank has 2 kg of

4536.4 --> 4540.48
gas because that's how much it weighs

4538.56 --> 4543.4400000000005
when we compress it we don't actually

4540.48 --> 4546.28
exactly know how much that

4543.44 --> 4549.28
is it just when you put it on the scales

4546.28 --> 4551.599999999999
2 kilograms heavier that's all that's

4549.28 --> 4554.48
all they

4551.6 --> 4557.88
do so then yeah oh it has weight yeah

4554.48 --> 4559.799999999999
colloquial weight sure if you put enough

4557.88 --> 4562.52
together it's going to be a dis

4559.8 --> 4564.12
equilibrium with the surrounding air and

4562.52 --> 4565.96
all that and then going to register

4564.12 --> 4569.719
weight on a scale doesn't mean that it

4565.96 --> 4572.08
has atomic weight like that that that is

4569.719 --> 4572.08
what you're

4573.12 --> 4581.679
weighing you can't put it in any linear

4577.639 --> 4586.679
relationship with what we know as

4581.679 --> 4591.32
weight and weight right how you know how

4586.679 --> 4596.639
much like how what's the volume of like

4591.32 --> 4596.639
a kilogram of this and that

4596.76 --> 4602.4400000000005
right well with all materials you know

4599.639 --> 4604.28
that except for

4602.44 --> 4607.32
what

4604.28 --> 4610.759999999999
gas things that are typically gas and

4607.32 --> 4612.08
you don't know that because gas has all

4610.76 --> 4614.2390000000005
these different

4612.08 --> 4616.719
compressions

4614.239 --> 4619.04
regular materials don't have that like

4616.719 --> 4620.88
liquid solid materials don't have that

4619.04 --> 4622.84
that's why it's

4620.88 --> 4626.1990000000005
reliable because it doesn't keep

4622.84 --> 4629.360000000001
changing all over the place

4626.199 --> 4634.159
yeah that's what they used to create

4629.36 --> 4636.96
that Convention of weight and atomic

4634.159 --> 4639.08
weight yeah you can't do that with gas

4636.96 --> 4641.4
but you can compress gas and put it on

4639.08 --> 4644.639
the scale and then have some weight

4641.4 --> 4649.599999999999
being registered yeah that weight is

4644.639 --> 4653.4400000000005
not tied into any

4649.6 --> 4656.679
linear understanding about

4653.44 --> 4660.32
material yeah has nothing to do with

4656.679 --> 4663.4800000000005
that it's not tied into anything real

4660.32 --> 4663.48
anything physics

4663.679 --> 4671.719
related it's just a scale registering

4667.719 --> 4676.4
weight and that's all it's just some

4671.719 --> 4678.96
pressure it's not a very specific thing

4676.4 --> 4682.04
that's always

4678.96 --> 4685.88
there because it's

4682.04 --> 4689.199
gas and with gas the

4685.88 --> 4694.28
weight it always changes depending on

4689.199 --> 4694.28
what the compression is it's not

4694.76 --> 4701.719
reliable right because weight is caused

4699.48 --> 4705.08
by the

4701.719 --> 4708.4800000000005
disequilibrium of the object with the

4705.08 --> 4711.5199999999995
median that it's surrounded by well if

4708.48 --> 4715.759999999999
the object is

4711.52 --> 4717.56
gas then it can only do that it can only

4715.76 --> 4720.6
press down if it's

4717.56 --> 4723.4800000000005
contained and then it will press down

4720.6 --> 4726.2390000000005
based on the average dis equilibrium of

4723.48 --> 4727.718999999999
the object and the gas within it versus

4726.239 --> 4730.0
the medium

4727.719 --> 4731.199
outside that difference is going to be

4730.0 --> 4734.0
very

4731.199 --> 4736.48
little unless you compress the gas

4734.0 --> 4739.199
inside of the tank to like really

4736.48 --> 4741.799999999999
unnaturally high

4739.199 --> 4745.159
levels and then it will become so much

4741.8 --> 4748.1990000000005
more of that gas inside compared to the

4745.159 --> 4750.719
gas outside that that will the very

4748.199 --> 4754.199
compression causes the disequilibrium

4750.719 --> 4757.719
the compression causes the weight CU in

4754.199 --> 4760.599999999999
a natural state it never does that you

4757.719 --> 4763.4
have to unnaturally compress it to get

4760.6 --> 4764.320000000001
it to even register weight

4763.4 --> 4768.28
at

4764.32 --> 4771.199
all yeah you can have gigantic amount of

4768.28 --> 4773.88
gas just sitting in a room it will not

4771.199 --> 4775.839999999999
register anything on a scale it will not

4773.88 --> 4779.76
do anything with the

4775.84 --> 4784.4400000000005
scale scale will be completely

4779.76 --> 4784.4400000000005
unaffected because gas doesn't press

4784.6 --> 4789.84
down it presses in all directions and it

4787.4 --> 4791.239
has to be contained and then the

4789.84 --> 4795.159000000001
container

4791.239 --> 4798.959999999999
solid can press down and maybe take a

4795.159 --> 4798.96
little bit of that gas pressure with

4803.52 --> 4810.92
it but the gas in inherently does not go

4808.56 --> 4814.0
down it doesn't do

4810.92 --> 4816.32
that it a lot of the time gas isn't even

4814.0 --> 4818.84
at this equilibrium with its surrounding

4816.32 --> 4821.759999999999
it's it's going to go up or it's going

4818.84 --> 4824.76
to go randomly in any

4821.76 --> 4824.76
direction

4830.79 --> 4839.96
[Music]

4836.28 --> 4843.04
right I mean gas in a vacuum chamber

4839.96 --> 4847.28
never goes down it only goes

4843.04 --> 4849.92
down if it's contained by an

4847.28 --> 4852.08
object that prevents it from escaping

4849.92 --> 4854.32
and then it's really the object that's

4852.08 --> 4856.239
going down

4854.32 --> 4857.96
because give that gas a chance it's not

4856.239 --> 4860.678999999999
going to go down it's going to go in all

4857.96 --> 4862.6
directions instead yeah that's the

4860.679 --> 4866.08
number one priority the number one

4862.6 --> 4869.76
priority for gas is to go in all

4866.08 --> 4872.76
directions down is just

4869.76 --> 4874.4400000000005
secondary like oh go in all directions

4872.76 --> 4877.52
because that's where the lower pressure

4874.44 --> 4881.04
is that's where they need to go yeah and

4877.52 --> 4883.719
then oh it's slightly more dense than

4881.04 --> 4885.36
the surrounding gas well then maybe

4883.719 --> 4888.719
while it's going in all Direction it

4885.36 --> 4890.639
might go down a little bit yeah until

4888.719 --> 4891.92
it's no longer a dise equilibrium with

4890.639 --> 4895.679
it

4891.92 --> 4898.96
surrounding so it's all mixed

4895.679 --> 4901.52
in but the number one priority for gas

4898.96 --> 4904.639
is that it goes in all

4901.52 --> 4906.4800000000005
directions to the lower pressure it

4904.639 --> 4911.08
doesn't really care for any

4906.48 --> 4911.08
directionality it's all

4911.639 --> 4916.4400000000005
secondary first it has to fill the

4913.88 --> 4916.4400000000005
available

4938.52 --> 4946.0
volume can you weigh rad on in its

4941.239 --> 4946.0
gaseous State no no no you

4946.96 --> 4952.4800000000005
can't I mean you might be able to

4949.719 --> 4955.76
compress it enough to register weight

4952.48 --> 4957.199
like compressing gas in a tank again the

4955.76 --> 4962.0
same thing

4957.199 --> 4965.678999999999
right but you're not going to weigh it

4962.0 --> 4969.36
and like get a a reliable reading on

4965.679 --> 4971.56
it while it's in a gaseous State like

4969.36 --> 4974.719
that's not going to tell

4971.56 --> 4978.320000000001
you like if you put a gas tank and it's

4974.719 --> 4981.04
going to register 2 kilg how do you know

4978.32 --> 4981.04
how much that

4985.08 --> 4992.159
is R down does not float in air it sinks

4988.6 --> 4995.360000000001
yeah until it dissolves in the air yeah

4992.159 --> 4999.799999999999
there's no gas that doesn't eventually

4995.36 --> 4999.799999999999
evaporate and mixes in with

5001.48 --> 5004.48
everything

5013.199 --> 5020.4
breath is moist no doesn't contain

5016.52 --> 5023.76
liquid it contains water

5020.4 --> 5026.679
vapor that's not liquid water vapor is

5023.76 --> 5026.679
not liquid it's a

5026.96 --> 5032.28
gas now if it becomes cold because the

5029.76 --> 5034.88
air outside of your lungs is much colder

5032.28 --> 5038.239
then and it might liquify again so that

5034.88 --> 5040.639
you see the water vapor the droplets

5038.239 --> 5043.159
forming but while you're breathing it

5040.639 --> 5043.159000000001
it's not

5044.96 --> 5048.32
liquid it's

5057.8 --> 5064.360000000001
gas Ron sinks below air and does not

5061.4 --> 5064.36
combine with it

5072.12 --> 5077.719
really I've never heard of that before

5075.36 --> 5080.599999999999
sounds quite

5077.719 --> 5084.0
hazardous but seriously what I've never

5080.6 --> 5086.84
heard like all gas eventually evaporates

5084.0 --> 5088.719
so are you saying that raon is gas

5086.84 --> 5090.84
that's basically like a liquid that

5088.719 --> 5094.36
doesn't

5090.84 --> 5094.360000000001
dissolve what the [ __ ]

5095.639 --> 5100.400000000001
I'm not talking about gases that are

5097.6 --> 5102.1990000000005
more dense than air yeah that's logical

5100.4 --> 5105.839999999999
yeah the point is is that all of them

5102.199 --> 5105.839999999999
eventually dissolve in the

5106.04 --> 5111.28
air that's the point everything

5109.08 --> 5114.239
dissolves in the air you're claiming

5111.28 --> 5118.239
here if I didn't read it wrong that

5114.239 --> 5118.239
radon doesn't do that

5120.48 --> 5124.28
okay well that's kind of

5127.28 --> 5133.44
crazy so radon apparently according to

5130.56 --> 5137.8
you is a gas that just doesn't

5133.44 --> 5143.44
expand it will just not not mix with

5137.8 --> 5143.4400000000005
other gas I guess that's really

5148.8 --> 5153.84
weird gases that are more dense than the

5151.48 --> 5157.28
air do not dissipa in there what the

5153.84 --> 5157.28
[ __ ] are you talking about

5158.159 --> 5165.44
[ __ ] that's absolute har [ __ ] you're

5161.76 --> 5170.08
just wrong potentially lying

5165.44 --> 5176.199
now yeah yeah yeah CO2 more dense than

5170.08 --> 5178.96
air definitely dissolves yeah like

5176.199 --> 5181.879999999999
everything everything

5178.96 --> 5185.639
does yeah sulur aif fluoride definitely

5181.88 --> 5187.679
more Den than areir yeah yeah definitely

5185.639 --> 5192.159000000001
dissolves in the

5187.679 --> 5197.32
air yeah like all gases

5192.159 --> 5200.239
so you're claiming radon doesn't do that

5197.32 --> 5202.08
sure sure I'm sure you made that up

5200.239 --> 5204.36
yourself I don't think there's any

5202.08 --> 5207.679
exception yeah it's called a second law

5204.36 --> 5210.839999999999
thermodynamics for a reason all gases

5207.679 --> 5214.1990000000005
expand all of

5210.84 --> 5214.1990000000005
them so

5219.67 --> 5225.1990000000005
[Music]

5221.79 --> 5225.199
[Applause]

5241.119 --> 5244.119
Dam

5244.679 --> 5251.4400000000005
dissolve dissipate whatever mix in with

5248.119 --> 5254.679
the rest of the air yeah all Air mixes

5251.44 --> 5257.96
in with other air all

5254.679 --> 5259.36
gases mix with other gases like they

5257.96 --> 5262.44
might

5259.36 --> 5264.199
repulse each other but they're still

5262.44 --> 5268.678999999999
going to mix

5264.199 --> 5268.678999999999
in cuz gas is spread out in all

5269.639 --> 5274.56
directions it becomes an in homogene

5272.119 --> 5274.5599999999995
genus

5280.44 --> 5287.5199999999995
Mash if you have a cool hey hey you got

5283.92 --> 5290.84
some demonstration for that [ __ ] for

5287.52 --> 5293.4800000000005
these crazy claims of yours of gas is

5290.84 --> 5296.88
not mixing that's cool you have any

5293.48 --> 5296.879999999999
demonstration for that hor

5296.93 --> 5300.109
[Music]

5301.04 --> 5304.04
[ __ ]

5314.239 --> 5318.839999999999
cuz if you put two gases in one

5316.199 --> 5322.28
container they're definitely not going

5318.84 --> 5326.639
to sit separate from one

5322.28 --> 5326.639
another it's the dumbest thing I've ever

5328.719 --> 5333.04
heard they do not combine yeah except

5331.84 --> 5335.679
they they

5333.04 --> 5339.28
do they

5335.679 --> 5340.76
do because of entropy gas just spreads

5339.28 --> 5343.96
out in all

5340.76 --> 5345.52
directions they're going to mix in and

5343.96 --> 5347.6
then when they're going to mix in I'm

5345.52 --> 5351.080000000001
pretty sure that the more dense gas is

5347.6 --> 5353.92
going to be percentile wise a little bit

5351.08 --> 5356.84
more present at the bottom section of

5353.92 --> 5359.639
the container while the less gas less

5356.84 --> 5362.679
dened gas will definitely be percentile

5359.639 --> 5363.84
wise more present at the top side of

5362.679 --> 5368.84
that

5363.84 --> 5370.88
container but they will be mingled

5368.84 --> 5374.1990000000005
because gas is spread in all directions

5370.88 --> 5376.96
they do mingle in yeah in this giant

5374.199 --> 5380.48
container we have here there's a lot of

5376.96 --> 5382.2390000000005
different gases and they are mixed in

5380.48 --> 5385.32
they don't sit

5382.239 --> 5387.919999999999
separate and they don't like oh there's

5385.32 --> 5391.48
no wind oh that means the gases are now

5387.92 --> 5394.32
separating no they don't do that they

5391.48 --> 5398.04
don't actually do

5394.32 --> 5398.04
that they don't

5399.84 --> 5408.400000000001
separate yeah like oil and water gases

5404.199 --> 5408.4
in the air don't

5413.6 --> 5419.4800000000005
separate they don't like oh well now

5417.44 --> 5423.4
that this friction is over I'm going to

5419.48 --> 5427.32
try to coagulate and like be your of

5423.4 --> 5430.44
this type of gas like no that doesn't

5427.32 --> 5434.48
happen that happens in

5430.44 --> 5437.04
liquids yeah coagulation surface tension

5434.48 --> 5440.36
oh guess what gas doesn't have surface

5437.04 --> 5442.96
tension yeah gas doesn't have surface

5440.36 --> 5448.199
tension liquid has surface

5442.96 --> 5451.08
tension gas doesn't have that yeah so if

5448.199 --> 5454.4
you just leave it all calm yeah you have

5451.08 --> 5457.199
this very very still no motion at all no

5454.4 --> 5461.04
friction nothing and different gas yeah

5457.199 --> 5464.839999999999
they're not going to separate and form

5461.04 --> 5467.159
layers CU they don't do that gases don't

5464.84 --> 5467.159000000001
do

5467.52 --> 5472.76
that

5469.119 --> 5476.08
yeah they're just going to mingle

5472.76 --> 5479.0
in everything's going to mingle in and

5476.08 --> 5481.36
then yeah perhaps the more dense gases

5479.0 --> 5483.76
are on average percentile wise going to

5481.36 --> 5485.5599999999995
sit more at the bottom of that container

5483.76 --> 5488.719
while the less dense gases are on

5485.56 --> 5490.679
average percentile wise going to be

5488.719 --> 5493.679
little bit more present at the top of

5490.679 --> 5496.1990000000005
that container and that's it there's no

5493.679 --> 5498.56
separation there there's no layering

5496.199 --> 5501.759999999999
it's not going to separate like oil and

5498.56 --> 5505.719
water you need to let that go it doesn't

5501.76 --> 5505.719
happen gases don't do

5506.51 --> 5513.4800000000005
[Music]

5509.44 --> 5516.719
that CO2 collect s in a mine no it

5513.48 --> 5520.32
doesn't collect it keeps pumping out if

5516.719 --> 5521.56
you keep pumping it out keep adding the

5520.32 --> 5524.36
amount of

5521.56 --> 5526.84
gas then yeah it's just going to keep on

5524.36 --> 5529.759999999999
moving and moving and prevent any other

5526.84 --> 5533.159000000001
gas from basically mingling in if

5529.76 --> 5535.88
there's constantly new gas being

5533.159 --> 5537.799999999999
introduced the rest of the gas is not

5535.88 --> 5540.8
going to have a chance to mingle in

5537.8 --> 5543.96
because it's getting pressed out by the

5540.8 --> 5546.6
newly roduced gas yeah that's what

5543.96 --> 5550.719
happens in the mine yeah as soon as that

5546.6 --> 5551.88
CO2 gets cut off from pumping out more

5550.719 --> 5555.4800000000005
out of the

5551.88 --> 5559.119
ground guess what happens yeah it's

5555.48 --> 5562.32
going to mingle in cuz that's what gases

5559.119 --> 5565.48
do they don't form puddles they don't

5562.32 --> 5565.48
form separated

5565.6 --> 5570.320000000001
layers

5567.56 --> 5573.04
yeah you can have only some kind of

5570.32 --> 5577.5199999999995
virtual separation if there is

5573.04 --> 5579.56
continually in large quantities new Pure

5577.52 --> 5583.719
Gas being

5579.56 --> 5588.639
introduced yeah and then the influx of

5583.719 --> 5591.84
new prevents that particular piece of

5588.639 --> 5594.159000000001
space where that gas gets introduced

5591.84 --> 5596.08
from mingling in with the outside world

5594.159 --> 5600.239
because the amount that's getting

5596.08 --> 5602.76
introduced in there exceeds the speed by

5600.239 --> 5605.32
which the gas from outside tries to

5602.76 --> 5608.56
mingle in yeah that's how that works

5605.32 --> 5611.599999999999
that's exactly how that works CU it is

5608.56 --> 5613.639
all mingling in it's just more gas is

5611.6 --> 5617.6
getting pumped out in

5613.639 --> 5619.159000000001
there to kind of like countermand the

5617.6 --> 5622.119000000001
natural

5619.159 --> 5624.159
entropy and that's why it seems like

5622.119 --> 5626.679
it's concentrated there it isn't it's

5624.159 --> 5629.44
the constant influx that is preventing

5626.679 --> 5631.88
the entropy from making everything

5629.44 --> 5635.119
mingle in with one another that's what's

5631.88 --> 5635.119
happening in there in that

5642.679 --> 5647.639
mine can you pour gas into a glass

5645.639 --> 5648.4800000000005
Beaker without a cover and it remain in

5647.639 --> 5650.119
that

5648.48 --> 5652.879999999999
Beaker

5650.119 --> 5655.119
no you can pour it in there it's going

5652.88 --> 5657.52
to sit there for a little while and then

5655.119 --> 5657.5199999999995
it'll

5658.159 --> 5665.92
dissipate because eventually gas

5662.679 --> 5667.04
dissolves in the rest of the gas it all

5665.92 --> 5669.36
mingles

5667.04 --> 5672.08
in dissolving might not be the right

5669.36 --> 5675.839999999999
word I don't give a [ __ ] at this

5672.08 --> 5678.639
point yeah it doesn't stay separate gas

5675.84 --> 5678.639
spreads in all

5680.76 --> 5689.679
directions yeah you can't pour gas in a

5685.199 --> 5692.678999999999
cup and then have it sit there forever

5689.679 --> 5695.52
yeah if you check

5692.679 --> 5697.36
30 seconds later you're going to notice

5695.52 --> 5700.96
or even smell or whatever like oh yeah

5697.36 --> 5702.5199999999995
that's still in there yeah sure yeah

5700.96 --> 5704.0
there's not a person in the world that's

5702.52 --> 5708.320000000001
going to come

5704.0 --> 5713.52
back 5 minutes later and then measure

5708.32 --> 5715.599999999999
that gas still being in there yeah not a

5713.52 --> 5718.84
person in the

5715.6 --> 5720.400000000001
world CU that's not what happens and you

5718.84 --> 5723.400000000001
know

5720.4 --> 5723.4
it

5731.0 --> 5736.52
just play this off I don't yeah shut up

5734.28 --> 5739.08
stop trying to run around the argument

5736.52 --> 5742.119000000001
the argument is is that

5739.08 --> 5746.08
gas doesn't go down go boom

5742.119 --> 5750.4
boom and it doesn't form

5746.08 --> 5752.5199999999995
layers yeah it doesn't do

5750.4 --> 5756.04
that that's what the argument's about

5752.52 --> 5756.040000000001
not about the words that I

5762.36 --> 5769.719
use would I like to be money on that

5765.719 --> 5769.719
what the [ __ ] are you what is that even

5771.08 --> 5778.199
mean can you post a URL no you don't

5775.88 --> 5778.1990000000005
have a

5780.32 --> 5783.32
wrench

5791.119 --> 5796.4
no there is no experience in reality

5793.88 --> 5801.4400000000005
akumu virus you never did any of those

5796.4 --> 5801.44
things stop lying to us and yourself

5802.0 --> 5807.04
[ __ ] don't lie to us about your

5804.96 --> 5809.719
[ __ ] Ballard experiences that you

5807.04 --> 5813.92
never had akumu

5809.719 --> 5815.92
virus getting k sick of you yeah didn't

5813.92 --> 5819.28
keep you around you could just keep

5815.92 --> 5823.36
inserting your conniving

5819.28 --> 5826.36
lies dirty stinky

5823.36 --> 5826.36
liar

5832.56 --> 5835.649
[Music]

5839.28 --> 5845.679
yeah I'm I am proving you lied I'm

5843.119 --> 5848.239
letting your comments sit in my chat

5845.679 --> 5848.2390000000005
akumu

5854.04 --> 5861.4
virus you never did

5857.119 --> 5864.36
anything you haven't done any of these

5861.4 --> 5866.119
things anything you said you have not

5864.36 --> 5869.598999999999
done

5866.119 --> 5872.639
that you think that gas can sit separate

5869.599 --> 5875.32
in layers and you think you've seen some

5872.639 --> 5879.92
kind of demonstration for this you're a

5875.32 --> 5881.92
[ __ ] liar nobody's ever seen that

5879.92 --> 5887.0
that guy earlier with the freaking

5881.92 --> 5887.0
raidon claim is probably a [ __ ] liar

5892.39 --> 5895.459000000001
[Music]

5900.119 --> 5906.039
too

5902.88 --> 5906.039
[Music]

5915.32 --> 5923.799999999999
you can't have gas sit separate in

5919.719 --> 5929.199
layers next to other gas without it

5923.8 --> 5933.360000000001
having dissipated within it it doesn't

5929.199 --> 5936.119
happen gas is always always mix in with

5933.36 --> 5938.88
the gases that surround them always they

5936.119 --> 5938.88
always do

5939.199 --> 5946.239
that yeah they don't immediately explode

5943.599 --> 5951.04
to mix up with one

5946.239 --> 5953.919999999999
another but they always end up mixing up

5951.04 --> 5955.639
always every single time there's no gas

5953.92 --> 5959.0
that stays

5955.639 --> 5961.4800000000005
separate yeah long time it's all long

5959.0 --> 5964.52
long time in your mind yeah but but it

5961.48 --> 5967.759999999999
never is permanent though

5964.52 --> 5971.4400000000005
never there is never a permanent

5967.76 --> 5974.92
separation of one gas with another

5971.44 --> 5977.879999999999
without a barrier it never exists it's

5974.92 --> 5982.119
not a single example in the [ __ ]

5977.88 --> 5984.4400000000005
world where there is a a puddle of gas

5982.119 --> 5988.239
sitting right out in the open against

5984.44 --> 5990.04
the air and it just sits there yeah it

5988.239 --> 5993.04
does not

5990.04 --> 5993.04
exist

6008.44 --> 6011.239
yeah it sits there for a long time

6010.28 --> 6014.719
Richard

6011.239 --> 6014.718999999999
G I mean

6018.08 --> 6022.8
seriously yeah you're [ __ ] at Kuma

6020.52 --> 6025.4800000000005
virus thanks for

6022.8 --> 6027.84
reemphasizing that you are a [ __ ] I

6025.48 --> 6031.598999999999
almost forgot that you're a [ __ ]

6027.84 --> 6034.4400000000005
[ __ ] cuz I don't really talk about

6031.599 --> 6038.52
physics a lot cuz every time I do you

6034.44 --> 6038.5199999999995
turn into a [ __ ]

6039.04 --> 6044.119
[ __ ] just make me want to kick you out

6042.679 --> 6048.08
you're just

6044.119 --> 6048.08
belligerent and hard learn

6049.92 --> 6052.92
it

6079.84 --> 6085.52
for

6082.679 --> 6088.32
hey hey dip [ __ ] get the [ __ ] out of my

6085.52 --> 6091.0
chat [ __ ] you didn't even get the

6088.32 --> 6095.239
name right [ __ ] with now you can [ __ ]

6091.0 --> 6099.52
off shove your glow up your

6095.239 --> 6099.5199999999995
ass while you're at it

6108.8 --> 6113.679
okay yeah gas does not have

6119.679 --> 6124.4
weight just gonna maybe I'm just going

6122.239 --> 6130.638999999999
to say it every single show it's just

6124.4 --> 6130.638999999999
like every show is going to have gas has

6131.639 --> 6137.92
no maybe just going to put it maybe I'm

6134.96 --> 6143.679
just going to call it the gas has no

6137.92 --> 6143.679
weight early bir show how about

6149.0 --> 6153.119
that maybe I should do

6155.199 --> 6161.5199999999995
that oh I wonder how long it's going to

6157.56 --> 6164.1990000000005
take until people stop responding to

6161.52 --> 6167.92
that probably longer than just calling

6164.199 --> 6167.919999999999
it flat Earth nobody gives a

6168.36 --> 6173.28
[ __ ] does make it true yeah it is true

6171.08 --> 6175.76
[ __ ] with now shut your [ __ ] mouth

6173.28 --> 6175.759999999999
akumu

6179.36 --> 6184.839999999999
[Music]

6182.119 --> 6187.679
virus all the contrary evidence no I

6184.84 --> 6191.56
didn't delete anything it's right there

6187.679 --> 6191.56
right in the video

6197.52 --> 6202.679
[ __ ] you like the new show name

6207.97 --> 6211.549
[Music]

6213.04 --> 6216.08
no I'm going to leave it flat Earth

6214.32 --> 6218.4
early bird but I'm going to keep bring

6216.08 --> 6220.5199999999995
this back up and I'm going to keep

6218.4 --> 6223.48
smashing people's heads

6220.52 --> 6225.88
in till they get it or shut the [ __ ] up

6223.48 --> 6229.678999999999
and stop

6225.88 --> 6232.679
talking right cuz they're wrong and I'm

6229.679 --> 6232.679
right

6235.28 --> 6241.08
and I deliver evidence that I'm right

6238.92 --> 6244.88
they keep explaining how I'm right and

6241.08 --> 6248.239
then dip shits keep on giving

6244.88 --> 6251.56
examples why they think it's wrong even

6248.239 --> 6253.5599999999995
though those examples don't work out

6251.56 --> 6255.92
because they prove that you haven't

6253.56 --> 6258.52
listened to a [ __ ] word I said about

6255.92 --> 6260.719
it that you don't even understand the

6258.52 --> 6262.92
entire context of what I'm Des

6260.719 --> 6265.52
describing that's what that proves it

6262.92 --> 6268.36
just proves you're a [ __ ] dumbass who

6265.52 --> 6270.84
thinks that a read out on a scale means

6268.36 --> 6273.36
weight you [ __ ] with that's what it

6270.84 --> 6276.679
means it means that you think that a

6273.36 --> 6280.08
readout on a scale is what weight is and

6276.679 --> 6283.76
that that's a physics yeah I got a scale

6280.08 --> 6286.44
that means physics cuz you're a [ __ ]

6283.76 --> 6288.599
[ __ ] that's why you can't let it go

6286.44 --> 6291.759999999999
you can't let go of your own

6288.599 --> 6294.400000000001
retardation that you learn in school and

6291.76 --> 6296.679
all the balart [ __ ] with teachers all

6294.4 --> 6299.5199999999995
give you oh you're so good you're so

6296.679 --> 6301.56
good the skill is Wai the physics and

6299.52 --> 6303.4400000000005
you're a [ __ ] [ __ ] that's what's

6301.56 --> 6309.080000000001
going on

6303.44 --> 6311.759999999999
[ __ ] yeah why you just deal with it you

6309.08 --> 6313.92
deal that you're incompetent that your

6311.76 --> 6317.360000000001
teachers were

6313.92 --> 6319.84
incompetent that you don't get it even

6317.36 --> 6322.759999999999
though you're probably like it's 20

6319.84 --> 6324.92
years later from school you still think

6322.76 --> 6329.88
you're smart even though you never got

6324.92 --> 6334.1990000000005
it right just told by a bunch of

6329.88 --> 6336.2390000000005
shoulder tapping ass wipes that you were

6334.199 --> 6338.719
right when you were clearly wrong and

6336.239 --> 6341.159
you didn't get it and didn't prove to

6338.719 --> 6342.84
anybody that you got it you just chanted

6341.159 --> 6345.4
a bunch of stupid

6342.84 --> 6348.96
formulas that were

6345.4 --> 6352.48
wrong H Newtonian mechanics formulas

6348.96 --> 6352.4800000000005
that were wrong

6353.199 --> 6357.879999999999
that are

6354.56 --> 6359.599
officially denounced to be wrong yeah

6357.88 --> 6361.8
they're wrong they're officially wrong

6359.599 --> 6364.4400000000005
you still use them though your teachers

6361.8 --> 6366.84
gave you such compliments for using

6364.44 --> 6369.598999999999
them

6366.84 --> 6373.360000000001
right and now you don't understand what

6369.599 --> 6377.84
weight is you're just a

6373.36 --> 6381.08
dumbass you think that a a readout on a

6377.84 --> 6383.4400000000005
scale means that what you put on the

6381.08 --> 6386.08
scale has weight that's what you think

6383.44 --> 6387.48
that that means cuz you don't even

6386.08 --> 6389.4
understand what weight is doesn't matter

6387.48 --> 6392.638999999999
how many times it's explain to you you

6389.4 --> 6396.159
just don't get it you don't understand

6392.639 --> 6401.1990000000005
what reality is what is

6396.159 --> 6405.48
happening why a scale gives you a weight

6401.199 --> 6405.48
readout you don't understand

6406.0 --> 6412.52
that you just think you don't need

6409.04 --> 6414.5199999999995
mechanics SK kill Rita well that means

6412.52 --> 6417.8
that there's so much mass on this that

6414.52 --> 6420.88
the gravity is causing the [ __ ]

6417.8 --> 6422.92
weight on the skill cuz you're a dumbass

6420.88 --> 6427.52
and you didn't get it and you're still

6422.92 --> 6427.52
thinking in Newtonian mechanics like a

6427.96 --> 6436.08
[ __ ] that's what's going on Bard [ __ ]

6432.52 --> 6436.080000000001
witht neonian

6436.84 --> 6441.04
[ __ ] that's why you don't get it

6439.4 --> 6442.48
that's why you still think gas has

6441.04 --> 6447.4
weight it

6442.48 --> 6452.159
doesn't you don't understand what weight

6447.4 --> 6455.199
is yeah you can have the three different

6452.159 --> 6458.28
versions of weight repeated to you over

6455.199 --> 6460.4
and over and over again like you're in

6458.28 --> 6463.96
in second

6460.4 --> 6467.48
grade yeah and it can happen like on a

6463.96 --> 6470.36
yearly basis for a decade and you still

6467.48 --> 6473.4
don't get it and you still get back here

6470.36 --> 6476.36
and start sputtering and protesting

6473.4 --> 6478.598999999999
guess this way to put someone in scale

6476.36 --> 6482.0
because you're a [ __ ] [ __ ] you

6478.599 --> 6485.360000000001
can't get over yourself

6482.0 --> 6485.36
[ __ ] you're

6495.32 --> 6500.679
wrong

6497.04 --> 6503.88
yeah putting things on a scale does it

6500.679 --> 6503.88
mean it has

6504.04 --> 6511.8
weight you don't know what weight is you

6507.96 --> 6511.8
don't know why it is

6514.0 --> 6519.36
there you're still thinking neonian like

6517.08 --> 6519.36
a

6529.199 --> 6535.0
dumbass

6531.96 --> 6537.4
yeah I know he's trolling lva Paul I

6535.0 --> 6537.4
know he

6537.8 --> 6542.679
is cu he's an [ __ ] and once you get

6540.44 --> 6545.159
the ballart triggered he won't shut the

6542.679 --> 6547.76
[ __ ] up until you kick him out I just

6545.159 --> 6550.04
kind of don't want to kick him

6547.76 --> 6551.719
out cuz if I'm going to kick him out

6550.04 --> 6554.44
then I just kind of don't want to talk

6551.719 --> 6557.56
to him again for like a

6554.44 --> 6560.239
month cuz he just one shot his [ __ ]

6557.56 --> 6562.400000000001
mouth whenever the subjects comes up

6560.239 --> 6565.879999999999
keeps getting it wrong and I'm sick of

6562.4 --> 6569.48
it I'm sick of people that can never get

6565.88 --> 6574.679
it right I hate people that always get

6569.48 --> 6577.799999999999
it wrong I lose my patience with people

6574.679 --> 6577.8
that always get it

6580.719 --> 6587.0
wrong no you don't know [ __ ] akumu virus

6584.28 --> 6588.5199999999995
you're a [ __ ] delusional [ __ ] and

6587.0 --> 6590.76
you don't know what the hell it is that

6588.52 --> 6593.56
you're doing

6590.76 --> 6596.119000000001
you get things wrong and you keep

6593.56 --> 6599.4400000000005
getting it

6596.119 --> 6604.88
wrong and people try to tell

6599.44 --> 6608.199
you how it's wrong why it's wrong what's

6604.88 --> 6610.639
happening how you could improve what

6608.199 --> 6613.48
you're doing and you don't do it you

6610.639 --> 6616.400000000001
keep doing the same [ __ ] over and over

6613.48 --> 6619.718999999999
again every single Dam time you don't

6616.4 --> 6621.08
adapt anything that comes out of you to

6619.719 --> 6624.52
whatever is

6621.08 --> 6627.0
happening I have to continually adapt

6624.52 --> 6628.92
the way that I explain things based on

6627.0 --> 6631.56
the [ __ ] horsh [ __ ] that comes

6628.92 --> 6635.08
spewing out of your mouth every goddamn

6631.56 --> 6636.96
time and you don't adapt anything

6635.08 --> 6638.84
because you're just not listening you're

6636.96 --> 6640.679
just regurgitating your [ __ ]

6638.84 --> 6644.079
programming that makes no

6640.679 --> 6646.92
sense that you can't justify it's based

6644.079 --> 6652.04
on outdated parameters that's what you

6646.92 --> 6652.04
keep doing and I'm sick of it

6654.679 --> 6659.599
I'm gonna kick you the [ __ ] out get the

6657.32 --> 6659.599
[ __ ]

6665.0 --> 6668.149
[Music]

6671.13 --> 6675.609
[Music]

6678.96 --> 6681.96
out

6682.599 --> 6686.56
yeah Akuma is not going to do anything

6684.8 --> 6691.92
especially now that I'm kicked him the

6686.56 --> 6691.92
[ __ ] out he's gonna stay out for a

6697.36 --> 6703.44
while cuz I need to talk about actual

6700.84 --> 6705.4400000000005
subjects I just I guess I'm going to

6703.44 --> 6707.079
kick every [ __ ] ballart that's been

6705.44 --> 6708.5599999999995
hanging around here for a while I'm G to

6707.079 --> 6711.5599999999995
kick them all

6708.56 --> 6714.159000000001
out because I'm going to bring in more

6711.56 --> 6716.4800000000005
of these actual relevant subjects and

6714.159 --> 6719.239
I'm going to hammer them in everybody's

6716.48 --> 6722.119
[ __ ] face

6719.239 --> 6725.28
nonstop because these things need to be

6722.119 --> 6727.0
understood and bolard confusion needs to

6725.28 --> 6730.159
get the [ __ ]

6727.0 --> 6734.04
out yeah go make your own [ __ ] videos

6730.159 --> 6736.32
on your own [ __ ] Channel yeah go spam

6734.04 --> 6738.88
your hor [ __ ] over

6736.32 --> 6741.599
there not in my

6738.88 --> 6745.599
chat

6741.599 --> 6745.599
you're not a baller anymore good for you

6746.93 --> 6750.029
[Music]

6755.679 --> 6758.679
duper

6765.48 --> 6774.44
right so yeah I lose my uh my patience

6770.679 --> 6776.719
this crap I mean some of you here like

6774.44 --> 6779.48
Richard G how many times have I talked

6776.719 --> 6782.599
about this now how many how many of the

6779.48 --> 6785.199
show is this about this subject think

6782.599 --> 6788.04
you've been following for a while how

6785.199 --> 6792.638999999999
what is this like the 10th

6788.04 --> 6792.639
time the 10th time in the last three

6794.32 --> 6800.239
years must maybe

6797.36 --> 6802.679
more and the same [ __ ] just keeps

6800.239 --> 6807.119
happening over and over again doesn't it

6802.679 --> 6810.119
especially a virus the same [ __ ] exactly

6807.119 --> 6813.159
the same over and over again every time

6810.119 --> 6815.0
no gas has layers it forms layers oh

6813.159 --> 6817.36
there's an exception there's this gas it

6815.0 --> 6822.28
doesn't mingle in all these insane

6817.36 --> 6822.28
claims about gas staying

6824.4 --> 6829.48
separate and oh oh of course Second Law

6827.4 --> 6836.079
thermodynamics doesn't have anything to

6829.48 --> 6836.079
do with gas what the [ __ ] is wrong with

6844.38 --> 6849.56
[Music]

6846.28 --> 6852.28
you it's a great topic I

6849.56 --> 6855.56
guess breaks people's mind it just gets

6852.28 --> 6858.599
me grumpy I hate it that people

6855.56 --> 6861.76
just I mean I don't know what else to do

6858.599 --> 6865.84
man I just don't what to do anymore man

6861.76 --> 6868.8
I just keep on trying to just like no

6865.84 --> 6872.04
this is that this that that

6868.8 --> 6874.719
that like there's only one way this can

6872.04 --> 6877.599
be

6874.719 --> 6880.32
guys gas does not go down go boom boom

6877.599 --> 6882.4400000000005
it doesn't form puddles it doesn't stay

6880.32 --> 6887.679
separate from other

6882.44 --> 6890.919999999999
gas and it doesn't have a atomic weight

6887.679 --> 6893.4
to it gases don't have that it doesn't

6890.92 --> 6895.32
work like that atomic weight isn't even

6893.4 --> 6896.48
established with materials in their

6895.32 --> 6902.0
gaseous

6896.48 --> 6905.04
State cuz why because gas doesn't have

6902.0 --> 6906.84
weight you could create some downward

6905.04 --> 6910.32
pressure If you contain it and if you

6906.84 --> 6913.52
put a lot of it in that container sure

6910.32 --> 6918.599
it's not weight

6913.52 --> 6921.1990000000005
though it's just some this equilibrium

6918.599 --> 6923.2390000000005
pressure some relative density dis

6921.199 --> 6926.28
equilibrium pressure it's not weight

6923.239 --> 6929.48
it's it doesn't it doesn't relate it

6926.28 --> 6932.079
there's no linear lockstep thing

6929.48 --> 6933.879999999999
there doesn't compart with the atomic

6932.079 --> 6938.599
weight it never

6933.88 --> 6942.04
does apparent gas weight on a scale in a

6938.599 --> 6945.92
tank there no relationship to atomic

6942.04 --> 6945.92
weight it's not the same

6948.599 --> 6951.599
thing

6959.8 --> 6966.679
if a demonstration of weight no it's not

6962.639 --> 6970.32
a demonstration of weight AR wble it's

6966.679 --> 6973.04
just weight's a convention it's a

6970.32 --> 6977.5599999999995
system based on relative density dis

6973.04 --> 6980.599
equilibrium pressure and then in air of

6977.56 --> 6982.360000000001
liquids and solids

6980.599 --> 6986.119000000001
yeah that's part of

6982.36 --> 6989.4
it and then there's a yeah the there's a

6986.119 --> 6989.4
quantity system with

6995.719 --> 7002.36
it the the whole the quantity system is

6999.599 --> 7005.1990000000005
literally what what it's used

7002.36 --> 7008.598999999999
for now you can quantify you can put a

7005.199 --> 7009.96
number to this weight the convention of

7008.599 --> 7012.04
weight you can put a number number to it

7009.96 --> 7013.159
it's like oh you put all this stuff on

7012.04 --> 7017.0
the

7013.159 --> 7019.679
scale and combined this is how much it

7017.0 --> 7023.92
weighs in

7019.679 --> 7026.32
air right but that in air is the part

7023.92 --> 7027.92
you don't really say when you do that

7026.32 --> 7028.92
it's just no you put it on a scale you

7027.92 --> 7032.119
weigh

7028.92 --> 7034.76
it the in a is not really thought about

7032.119 --> 7038.159
because most people usually only weigh

7034.76 --> 7041.56
things in air and not like in

7038.159 --> 7044.4
water or in something else right that's

7041.56 --> 7044.400000000001
not where you do

7047.0 --> 7053.4
that but what weight is

7050.52 --> 7056.84
practically is relative density dis

7053.4 --> 7060.32
equilibrium Force how much is the object

7056.84 --> 7060.32
at this equilibrium with its

7062.239 --> 7065.678999999999
surrounding that

7067.56 --> 7074.360000000001
determines like yeah how much pressure

7070.84 --> 7077.079
it will give and then depending on how

7074.36 --> 7080.159
much of it that exists like how much

7077.079 --> 7082.5599999999995
volume of that this equilibrium is

7080.159 --> 7083.4
happening that will create that Force so

7082.56 --> 7087.639
if

7083.4 --> 7089.199
there's a little thing that's at this

7087.639 --> 7091.04
equilibri with the surrounding it will

7089.199 --> 7095.119
create that little bit of pressure based

7091.04 --> 7098.92
on its volume if that same type of

7095.119 --> 7101.598999999999
substance exists in a vast quantity it

7098.92 --> 7105.56
will this equilibrium will be exactly

7101.599 --> 7108.8
the same except now all of that

7105.56 --> 7111.679
material together will push down

7108.8 --> 7113.8
creating a lot more force and thus a lot

7111.679 --> 7118.159
more

7113.8 --> 7121.0
weight even though the density was the

7118.159 --> 7122.879999999999
same and that's what weight is for it's

7121.0 --> 7125.96
really about the

7122.88 --> 7129.76
quantification of this equilibrium

7125.96 --> 7132.8
pressure that's what weight is for right

7129.76 --> 7134.719
anyway I'm going to round out the show

7132.8 --> 7136.119000000001
thanks everyone for coming I hope you

7167.639 --> 7171.76
12 on a Friday and I'm going to join the

7170.119 --> 7173.719
Flat Earth debates over at Nathan Oakley

7171.76 --> 7175.8
980 Channel which should start up any

7173.719 --> 7179.88
second now hope to see you there in the

7175.8 --> 7180.96
chat and until the next video oh might

7179.88 --> 7183.639
