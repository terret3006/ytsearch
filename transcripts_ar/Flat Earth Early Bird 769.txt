[Music]

71.119 --> 74.56
it was kind of weird because

76.72 --> 83.03999999999999
i just overslept i think

80.799 --> 86.4
i didn't realize it was this late i

83.04 --> 89.68
thought it was like

86.4 --> 93.36
like just a little past

89.68 --> 95.2
one but i guess i was over an hour late

93.36 --> 97.2
didn't even realize that yet really

95.2 --> 99.92
weird

97.2 --> 102.399
but uh yeah anyway gonna be a short show

99.92 --> 106.479
today because of this

102.399 --> 106.479
some 50 minutes

108.96 --> 116.96
and i still got my breakfast coffee

112.479 --> 116.96
right here and i need some of that

120.159 --> 124.64
yeah it's odd i did not go to bed

122.439 --> 129.84
particularly late today

124.64 --> 129.84
or tonight but

129.92 --> 133.599
i guess i just really needed it

134.72 --> 139.92
got some chicken broccoli dinner but i

137.92 --> 141.67999999999998
did have it like even after 12. i think

139.92 --> 144.64
i ate it at one o'clock

141.68 --> 148.31900000000002
which is kind of unusual but i was not

144.64 --> 148.319
going to skip dinner again

148.72 --> 157.84
so anyway let's see who's left

151.76 --> 157.84
this is five watching

160.08 --> 164.56
let's see if somebody can find their way

161.84 --> 164.56
into the chat

164.879 --> 169.67999999999998
maybe after waiting an hour people have

167.28 --> 172.4
gone on and went to do other things

169.68 --> 172.4
i'm not sure

172.72 --> 177.12
but yeah i didn't really expect to be

174.64 --> 177.11999999999998
this late

177.18 --> 180.249
[Music]

182.84 --> 185.84
myself

200.959 --> 207.2
hey here we go again good to see you

204.239 --> 207.20000000000002
sca dawson

215.84 --> 219.12
can i repeat my excuse for my excuses

218.4 --> 221.68
that

219.12 --> 223.76
i had my alarm clock set at 12 o'clock

221.68 --> 225.04000000000002
when it went off i felt like damn it i

223.76 --> 227.76
really need

225.04 --> 230.07999999999998
just five more minutes sleep and then

227.76 --> 233.67999999999998
suddenly it was

230.08 --> 235.43900000000002
uh an hour and 45 minutes later

233.68 --> 237.36
apparently

235.439 --> 239.76
it just hasn't had never happened before

237.36 --> 242.87900000000002
like that

239.76 --> 246.319
so yeah that was it

242.879 --> 248.79899999999998
it's just like oh i guess i really

246.319 --> 255.83999999999997
needed those extra

248.799 --> 255.84
one hour and 45 minutes of sleep

259.84 --> 262.15999999999997
right

263.04 --> 274.16
it was weird

269.8 --> 276.8
[Music]

274.16 --> 279.68
snooze button is a killer well with me

276.8 --> 282.88
it usually isn't

279.68 --> 286.08
with me like 15 minutes

282.88 --> 288.88
sometimes like 30 but

286.08 --> 289.28
i don't know my intuition rarely lets it

288.88 --> 291.12
last

289.28 --> 292.479
much longer than that because at that

291.12 --> 295.199
point suddenly i

292.479 --> 298.0
realized like i am being i waiting very

295.199 --> 302.40000000000003
long and then i'll just snap awake

298.0 --> 307.52
that usually happens but this time it

302.4 --> 307.52
didn't happen this is it's

308.84 --> 311.84
weird

314.4 --> 316.79999999999995
all right

322.84 --> 327.039
anyway

325.039 --> 328.56
i've been finishing up babylon 5

327.039 --> 330.88
yesterday

328.56 --> 332.56
after bladder debate somewhere in the

330.88 --> 334.24
evening

332.56 --> 335.919
and also noticed that there was a new

334.24 --> 338.24
season of cobra kai

335.919 --> 340.56
so i then basically went on to watch

338.24 --> 343.68
that

340.56 --> 346.56
and it yeah it's very amusing

343.68 --> 346.56
as it always is

347.52 --> 353.28
something better to dwell on than like

350.88 --> 356.88
the last episode of babylon 5 which is

353.28 --> 359.11999999999995
extremely depressing and dramatic

356.88 --> 359.12
so

360.0 --> 366.4
but i'm still going to watch the movies

362.4 --> 368.31899999999996
just wasn't in the moon for it

366.4 --> 370.79999999999995
and perhaps even like the follow-up

368.319 --> 381.84000000000003
series have you watched it

370.8 --> 381.84000000000003
here we go again

384.639 --> 390.639
all right anyway sorry for being so late

387.36 --> 392.56
it's very unusual for me to be this late

390.639 --> 394.96000000000004
i thought like oh no damn it i'm going

392.56 --> 399.52
to be 10 minutes late again

394.96 --> 399.52
oh wait it's 2 o'clock damn it

407.6 --> 411.36
no tiny wumbo i have not

415.36 --> 419.36
it's hard not to have the old character

417.12 --> 422.319
yeah i agree

419.36 --> 425.44
totally agree and they didn't exactly

422.319 --> 427.36
use the follow-up characters as well

425.44 --> 429.44
it would have been good if they had

427.36 --> 432.40000000000003
established

429.44 --> 434.96
those individuals already through

432.4 --> 436.96
babylon five if we'd had already been

434.96 --> 438.71999999999997
introduced to basically some of the

436.96 --> 440.71999999999997
important crew that was going to be on

438.72 --> 442.88000000000005
that ship

440.72 --> 444.0
through babylon 5 if they kind of if we

442.88 --> 446.56
got to see them

444.0 --> 448.639
before see then it would have been a

446.56 --> 450.639
much smoother transition now it's just

448.639 --> 453.36
like oh

450.639 --> 455.199
complete break here's a whole bunch of

453.36 --> 457.44
new people

455.199 --> 458.96000000000004
and at first you think like oh sheridan

457.44 --> 461.44
he's gonna be there right

458.96 --> 461.44
no

463.68 --> 467.52
yeah it's a bit of a bummer

470.56 --> 477.44
arwen is a watch a space show

473.68 --> 480.08
type english yeah i do

477.44 --> 481.44
max martin i'm a big fan of science

480.08 --> 493.84
fiction

481.44 --> 493.84
that's right

498.879 --> 507.84000000000003
although i did basically finish watching

501.84 --> 507.84
it now

523.279 --> 526.959
the star is called david

528.72 --> 533.36
i think so it's kind of confusing

533.519 --> 539.519
he doesn't look very one quarter member

536.88 --> 539.519
if he was

543.2 --> 548.0
maybe he just has this bone lump

546.399 --> 563.839
somewhere hidden in his hair or

548.0 --> 563.839
something i don't know

573.92 --> 577.12
right but anyway i haven't watched that

575.92 --> 580.16
yet so i yeah

577.12 --> 580.16
i don't know about it

582.8 --> 586.8
but yeah it's not the same it doesn't

585.279 --> 588.959
have the same

586.8 --> 590.0
chemistry as like everything that's

588.959 --> 594.0799999999999
happening on babylon

590.0 --> 596.08
5 over there so

594.08 --> 598.8000000000001
what happened yeah i'm just extremely

596.08 --> 604.0790000000001
late there at 306.

598.8 --> 607.04
i overslept by over one and a half hours

604.079 --> 607.04
so yeah

614.64 --> 621.68
i'll try not to let that happen again

618.0 --> 621.68
because that's kind of annoying

626.959 --> 634.3199999999999
oh oh a more finished finish to london

630.48 --> 638.399
not only that how about lita

634.32 --> 640.399
lita and jakar like they're

638.399 --> 643.92
i've been thinking about it again and

640.399 --> 646.079
this is probably not even new

643.92 --> 650.079
there should have been at least a sixth

646.079 --> 650.079
season maybe even a seventh

650.48 --> 654.64
like where the the issues with the

654.0 --> 658.079
psycho

654.64 --> 659.36
would be finished up the side this yeah

658.079 --> 662.8
the

659.36 --> 663.12
the psionics wars and lita is going to

662.8 --> 665.3599999999999
be

663.12 --> 666.16
like well it's like she said a nuclear

665.36 --> 668.24
bomb shows

666.16 --> 670.959
i think that she was going to end up as

668.24 --> 675.76
a main protagonist

670.959 --> 679.3599999999999
because she was just way too powerful

675.76 --> 682.16
and getting cocky about it so that was

679.36 --> 683.44
naturally going to grow into an arc that

682.16 --> 686.24
was going to be very

683.44 --> 687.36
powerful probably who knows man at some

686.24 --> 690.399
point she might have just

687.36 --> 690.399
single-handedly just

690.48 --> 696.9590000000001
yeah just like a one woman

693.92 --> 698.8
army against an entire race or something

696.959 --> 700.4799999999999
you know there was all these

698.8 --> 702.4799999999999
possibilities like

700.48 --> 704.399
her and your car doing all kinds of

702.48 --> 707.2
stuff together

704.399 --> 708.48
but yeah they broke it off because well

707.2 --> 711.519
it is logical

708.48 --> 714.32
because if jakar the character the actor

711.519 --> 717.839
if he died

714.32 --> 720.0
you can't replace that he was had a big

717.839 --> 723.12
part of the spirit

720.0 --> 724.16
of babylon 5 of what it was and if he

723.12 --> 726.5600000000001
just dropped away

724.16 --> 729.1999999999999
you can't replace that so just the

726.56 --> 731.5999999999999
entire story literally just broke apart

729.2 --> 733.0400000000001
it unraveled because he was not no

731.6 --> 735.44
longer there anymore it's extreme

733.04 --> 744.51
straight it's an extreme tragedy

735.44 --> 747.6690000000001
in my opinion

744.51 --> 747.669
[Music]

750.88 --> 754.0
i even wonder like what he looked like

753.2 --> 756.0790000000001
without

754.0 --> 757.2
without his mask because i'm pretty sure

756.079 --> 760.3199999999999
that

757.2 --> 761.2
he just is jakar like i don't even know

760.32 --> 763.7600000000001
what he looks like

761.2 --> 766.399
without the mask because that mask is

763.76 --> 766.399
like him

768.72 --> 772.1600000000001
i'm not talking about alita movie i'm

771.279 --> 776.16
talking about

772.16 --> 780.16
babylon 5 the series the whole thing

776.16 --> 783.4399999999999
always i don't even know what elita is

780.16 --> 786.48
oh yeah wait that's a stupid disney

783.44 --> 788.24
techno movies transhumanist [ __ ] isn't

786.48 --> 791.6
it

788.24 --> 794.72
with the unnaturally big-eyed girl yeah

791.6 --> 798.0
that i know i'm talking about

794.72 --> 801.0400000000001
babylon 5 the 90s science fiction

798.0 --> 804.88
series one of the best story arced

801.04 --> 807.12
series ever made yeah that one

804.88 --> 808.72
the one that is incomplete because one

807.12 --> 811.839
of the primary actors

808.72 --> 814.9590000000001
died it's a great tragedy

811.839 --> 817.44
because it left the story incomplete and

814.959 --> 820.399
it is one of the best

817.44 --> 829.839
siri stories i've ever seen so it's a

820.399 --> 829.839
great tragedy

832.16 --> 834.48
um

840.839 --> 846.48
remake ha i don't i

843.6 --> 847.44
i don't think that the original maker

846.48 --> 850.48
allows

847.44 --> 853.2790000000001
a remake of this that would be just a

850.48 --> 855.839
direct assault

853.279 --> 856.959
on the spirit of it like how are you

855.839 --> 860.9590000000001
gonna remake this

856.959 --> 863.88
it's always going to be a poor imitation

860.959 --> 865.04
because where are you gonna find these

863.88 --> 869.12
magnificent

865.04 --> 871.5999999999999
story carrying actors which ones

869.12 --> 872.88
oh wait there barely aren't any they're

871.6 --> 875.76
all liberal

872.88 --> 876.959
freaks now that are just squirting and

875.76 --> 880.56
trying to

876.959 --> 882.88
force their satanism into the world now

880.56 --> 885.199
yeah that's not gonna work it's all just

882.88 --> 888.16
a bunch of pieces of [ __ ]

885.199 --> 890.24
that cannot even find the passion to

888.16 --> 891.76
care about the product they're in yeah

890.24 --> 893.839
that's right there's not gonna be a

891.76 --> 896.399
remake of babylon 5. that would be

893.839 --> 898.32
insane

896.399 --> 899.44
it would probably be one of the most

898.32 --> 903.0400000000001
hated remakes

899.44 --> 913.839
ever created because it's such an insult

903.04 --> 913.8389999999999
if they did that

923.76 --> 931.8389999999999
it's very simple babylon 5 the series

927.839 --> 935.2790000000001
are the characters a whole bunch of

931.839 --> 938.32
really amazing powerful

935.279 --> 941.12
actors that make

938.32 --> 941.759
those characters those characters are

941.12 --> 944.9590000000001
there they're

941.759 --> 947.04
interesting and it makes this series

944.959 --> 949.279
good luck trying to find that chemistry

947.04 --> 952.48
again it's not gonna happen

949.279 --> 954.72
like ever what other series are like oh

952.48 --> 956.32
this is a regular occurrence that

954.72 --> 958.8000000000001
just the actors come together and

956.32 --> 960.9590000000001
suddenly this epic saga just

958.8 --> 962.8
brings forth from it oh yeah yeah which

960.959 --> 966.4799999999999
science fiction series out there is

962.8 --> 969.7589999999999
is that exactly

966.48 --> 970.16
none there isn't any because most actors

969.759 --> 973.839
just

970.16 --> 975.759
suck they just don't care enough

973.839 --> 983.839
to actually get an act together like

975.759 --> 983.839
that yeah

984.26 --> 987.419
[Music]

990.32 --> 993.6800000000001
no i have not watched battlestar

992.24 --> 995.92
galactica all the new

993.68 --> 997.7589999999999
i did watch it in the day i didn't watch

995.92 --> 999.12
the new one i thought it was just a

997.759 --> 1001.279
nasty

999.12 --> 1002.24
old battlestar galactica was kind of

1001.279 --> 1004.72
like

1002.24 --> 1005.6800000000001
it was a bit kiddie stuff and i liked it

1004.72 --> 1008.5600000000001
about that

1005.68 --> 1010.56
the newer one is just brutal military

1008.56 --> 1013.68
[ __ ] and it sucks

1010.56 --> 1013.68
i didn't like it at all

1017.199 --> 1020.959
it's just aggressive

1021.12 --> 1024.48
like battlestar galactica the new series

1023.199 --> 1026.3999999999999
is more like

1024.48 --> 1028.64
when you call this the movie series

1026.4 --> 1028.64
again

1030.48 --> 1032.88
damn it

1037.28 --> 1042.0
starship troopers they made it too much

1040.079 --> 1044.079
into starship troopers

1042.0 --> 1047.039
about to start galactica series it was

1044.079 --> 1047.039
just too aggressive

1047.41 --> 1052.16
[Music]

1049.919 --> 1054.88
now of course people that like starship

1052.16 --> 1057.039
troopers will say yeah

1054.88 --> 1058.5590000000002
but yeah it's not battlestar galactica

1057.039 --> 1059.76
it doesn't have the atmosphere of the

1058.559 --> 1063.44
original series

1059.76 --> 1065.919
like where's the disco why is nobody gay

1063.44 --> 1067.76
and not saying they're gay just kidding

1065.919 --> 1070.4
but yeah that was a lot of battlestar

1067.76 --> 1070.4
galactica

1071.52 --> 1081.84
it was a kind of gay and disco-ish

1082.08 --> 1095.84
yes the original from the 80s

1098.36 --> 1101.54
[Music]

1106.0 --> 1109.84
i don't even remember most of it

1111.6 --> 1115.039
because yeah battlestar galactica is

1113.84 --> 1118.08
literally just

1115.039 --> 1121.36
kitty [ __ ] compared to babylon 5.

1118.08 --> 1124.559
it really is it's just

1121.36 --> 1126.9599999999998
stupid sci-fi kitty [ __ ]

1124.559 --> 1129.12
compared to babylon 5. like battlestar

1126.96 --> 1130.24
galactica barely even has a consistent

1129.12 --> 1133.1999999999998
story

1130.24 --> 1133.679
and so much nonsense failure you just

1133.2 --> 1138.0800000000002
you'd

1133.679 --> 1138.0800000000002
laugh half of the time of how silly it

1143.73 --> 1146.9
[Music]

1148.84 --> 1151.84
looked

1155.28 --> 1157.52
ah

1159.6 --> 1164.48
hey man damn it i have to do newspaper

1162.799 --> 1168.48
rounds too

1164.48 --> 1172.0
i don't wanna i just wanna

1168.48 --> 1172.0
go back to bed or something

1177.44 --> 1182.64
crypto is doing well sure

1189.679 --> 1193.8400000000001
is that doing well is it

1199.36 --> 1202.9599999999998
if you mean yes we are all being

1202.159 --> 1208.3200000000002
corralled

1202.96 --> 1208.32
towards crypto then yes yes we are

1214.32 --> 1219.28
yeah well don't wish you have more it's

1217.12 --> 1222.799
[ __ ]

1219.28 --> 1225.039
it's like having gold it's completely

1222.799 --> 1227.76
useless to think oh i wish i had more

1225.039 --> 1229.84
because now it is becoming more valuable

1227.76 --> 1230.8799999999999
it's a complete waste of your time that

1229.84 --> 1234.0
only

1230.88 --> 1237.919
ever matters if you have

1234.0 --> 1241.12
money left over for savings

1237.919 --> 1243.3600000000001
and you probably don't and neither do i

1241.12 --> 1244.6399999999999
so all of that idea oh it would have

1243.36 --> 1246.84
been more valuable is

1244.64 --> 1248.3200000000002
literally a complete waste of your

1246.84 --> 1251.36
energy

1248.32 --> 1253.2
that only matters if you have money

1251.36 --> 1254.8799999999999
left over that you kind of want to

1253.2 --> 1258.4
invest or make

1254.88 --> 1260.64
more valuable or all that we don't

1258.4 --> 1263.8400000000001
so it's just complete waste of time to

1260.64 --> 1263.8400000000001
think about that

1272.24 --> 1280.559
what george sanford that i doubt it

1276.88 --> 1282.24
like what printing i think that a lot of

1280.559 --> 1284.799
time the money supposedly

1282.24 --> 1285.44
is conjured up they don't even print it

1284.799 --> 1291.84
they just

1285.44 --> 1291.8400000000001
write up a bunch of numbers

1307.86 --> 1312.559
[Music]

1316.88 --> 1319.8400000000001
you

1328.64 --> 1334.64
everyone buys oil and gas in dollars

1331.52 --> 1334.6399999999999
well not everybody

1340.559 --> 1343.9189999999999
not everybody anymore

1344.08 --> 1348.3999999999999
there's still a great amount of people

1348.559 --> 1352.72
even in russia really

1353.28 --> 1357.28
i what about the brics i don't think

1356.159 --> 1360.64
they do

1357.28 --> 1362.48
i think that they trade differently

1360.64 --> 1366.3200000000002
among one another

1362.48 --> 1368.4
india china russia was it that was that

1366.32 --> 1369.84
the foundation for the rix so i don't

1368.4 --> 1375.8400000000001
think that's really

1369.84 --> 1375.84
in effect anymore

1380.4 --> 1388.72
or iran that's the one damn it

1384.799 --> 1391.84
then it i ran

1388.72 --> 1395.679
was it iran russia or

1391.84 --> 1397.6
india i don't know man the brics is

1395.679 --> 1399.6000000000001
haven't really looked into that for a

1397.6 --> 1403.84
while but it was like the whole

1399.6 --> 1403.84
asian block mostly

1408.64 --> 1412.7990000000002
because the saudis only accept dollars

1410.72 --> 1417.84
while the saudis aren't the only

1412.799 --> 1417.84
oil producers in the world max martin

1420.24 --> 1431.84
and yeah nobody's forcing anybody to

1423.679 --> 1431.8400000000001
buy oil from the saudis

1437.52 --> 1445.84
brazil russia india china

1440.88 --> 1445.8400000000001
south africa right

1448.799 --> 1452.0
so it wasn't the iran

1452.24 --> 1459.84
i thought it was like that i knew that

1455.12 --> 1459.84
brazil was in there

1481.83 --> 1486.02
[Music]

1484.84 --> 1494.1699999999998
laughs

1486.02 --> 1494.17
[Music]

1500.559 --> 1505.039
yeah russian russia is very

1503.6 --> 1507.9189999999999
self-sufficient

1505.039 --> 1510.32
although their primary output is gas

1507.919 --> 1513.44
like they got

1510.32 --> 1517.12
enough gas to

1513.44 --> 1517.1200000000001
fill the entire realm with

1517.36 --> 1523.36
because they have access to that deep

1520.48 --> 1525.2
gas arctic pocket that's like insanely

1523.36 --> 1528.32
large

1525.2 --> 1531.2
that was originally the great threat to

1528.32 --> 1535.4399999999998
destroy the world and then they just

1531.2 --> 1535.8400000000001
tamed it and now they're just tapping it

1535.44 --> 1540.0800000000002
for

1535.84 --> 1543.84
like infinite amount of gas

1540.08 --> 1543.84
so yeah

1586.559 --> 1590.6399999999999
i don't know about that george sanford

1588.72 --> 1592.4
that is not what i was referring to i

1590.64 --> 1596.48
don't know about the oil wells over

1592.4 --> 1596.48
there but russia is a pretty big country

1596.559 --> 1600.96
so i'll bet there is plenty of oil but

1599.039 --> 1602.96
what is really standing out is the

1600.96 --> 1605.8400000000001
amount of gas and that's not

1602.96 --> 1606.72
a side thing from an oil well that's a

1605.84 --> 1610.08
giant

1606.72 --> 1613.039
giant arctic gas bubble

1610.08 --> 1615.4399999999998
giant i remember the time when it was

1613.039 --> 1617.6
announced that that freaking bubble

1615.44 --> 1618.96
at some point the ice would melt and

1617.6 --> 1620.6399999999999
then all that gas would be

1618.96 --> 1622.08
released in the atmosphere causing

1620.64 --> 1624.64
literally all life

1622.08 --> 1626.48
to choke to death that's what they said

1624.64 --> 1629.3600000000001
about it originally

1626.48 --> 1631.2
the fear porn everybody well russia has

1629.36 --> 1636.08
engaged to basically

1631.2 --> 1636.0800000000002
just tame it and start using it

1638.84 --> 1641.84
instead

1642.96 --> 1648.3990000000001
and that's why they have yeah almost

1645.039 --> 1648.399
unlimited amount of gas

1648.559 --> 1655.84
and that's why they sell it very cheap

1659.279 --> 1662.88
right well gas is extremely efficient

1661.84 --> 1666.48
and clean

1662.88 --> 1666.48
it is gas is

1666.96 --> 1672.88
i think at this point the cleanest

1670.24 --> 1673.6
fossil fuel it's not even fossil fuel

1672.88 --> 1676.0800000000002
but its

1673.6 --> 1676.08
cheapest

1676.88 --> 1683.919
uh earth based

1680.159 --> 1687.5200000000002
non-durable resource like the the most

1683.919 --> 1690.7990000000002
the the cleanest earth-based

1687.52 --> 1690.799
resource there is

1693.52 --> 1700.48
yeah so yeah of course

1696.96 --> 1703.1200000000001
the whole world should be using that

1700.48 --> 1704.48
for as long as it lasts because it is

1703.12 --> 1708.1589999999999
very clean

1704.48 --> 1711.84
and very cheap and there is

1708.159 --> 1711.8400000000001
almost infinite amounts of it

1712.159 --> 1716.24
i think that like the whole world can

1713.919 --> 1719.44
just run on that

1716.24 --> 1725.84
on that particular amount of gas for

1719.44 --> 1725.8400000000001
several decades if not more

1757.919 --> 1765.1200000000001
zero co2 gas emission power

1761.12 --> 1767.279
wow talk about a massive massive waste

1765.12 --> 1769.84
of focus

1767.279 --> 1769.84
terrible

1770.399 --> 1776.8799999999999
yeah seriously people that that focus

1773.84 --> 1780.08
on like co2 le

1776.88 --> 1781.6000000000001
like industry completely without

1780.08 --> 1783.6
but all these people should all just

1781.6 --> 1787.4399999999998
[ __ ] kill themselves

1783.6 --> 1791.039
what a goddamn waste

1787.44 --> 1794.159
we need the co2 life plant life

1791.039 --> 1797.6
needs the co2 power plants that

1794.159 --> 1801.2
produce no co2 what a goddamn

1797.6 --> 1803.84
waste what a waste it's the dumbest

1801.2 --> 1803.8400000000001
[ __ ] thing

1806.84 --> 1813.84
ever

1809.84 --> 1817.039
like at this point the entire

1813.84 --> 1819.6
freaking u.n agenda the entire thing is

1817.039 --> 1821.679
literally going to be destroyed because

1819.6 --> 1825.039
of the co2 nonsense

1821.679 --> 1827.3600000000001
if they had kept that part out

1825.039 --> 1828.24
then who knows how long the u.n would

1827.36 --> 1833.1999999999998
have held out

1828.24 --> 1836.24
but because of this [ __ ] co2 [ __ ]

1833.2 --> 1838.64
it is going to be destroyed

1836.24 --> 1839.679
it is not going to last because it is

1838.64 --> 1845.2
the greatest

1839.679 --> 1845.2
waste of time ever thought up

1846.399 --> 1854.08
like co2 production is necessary

1850.799 --> 1857.6
there needs to be ground-based

1854.08 --> 1861.9189999999999
co2 production in industry

1857.6 --> 1864.9599999999998
co2 needs to be pumped out at quantities

1861.919 --> 1868.0800000000002
into the open air like we all

1864.96 --> 1871.2
need that right

1868.08 --> 1874.6399999999999
co2 no co2

1871.2 --> 1893.8400000000001
industry it's the worst wasted time

1874.64 --> 1893.8400000000001
ever it's only a giant waste of time

1897.44 --> 1900.64
like the only way you can even think of

1899.76 --> 1904.0
that it would be

1900.64 --> 1907.2
so sort of handy is yeah you can

1904.0 --> 1909.36
direct the co2 if you can do that in a

1907.2 --> 1910.559
power plant or whatever and there is co2

1909.36 --> 1913.519
side product and then

1910.559 --> 1915.12
no release it in the open air but yeah

1913.519 --> 1918.159
bottle it up

1915.12 --> 1918.6399999999999
and then send those bottle up co2 tanks

1918.159 --> 1921.8400000000001
to

1918.64 --> 1921.8400000000001
i don't know growers

1922.24 --> 1926.0
to archeries to whatever

1926.08 --> 1933.279
to plant producers and then

1929.919 --> 1937.3600000000001
let them use this co2 to yeah

1933.279 --> 1940.399
to enhance the plants if it could be

1937.36 --> 1941.1999999999998
separated and yeah industrially utilized

1940.399 --> 1944.2399999999998
like that

1941.2 --> 1945.6000000000001
that's not a bad idea but to completely

1944.24 --> 1948.72
try to bypass

1945.6 --> 1951.76
co2 production in general what a

1948.72 --> 1955.1200000000001
god damn waste what a

1951.76 --> 1957.679
waste of focus it's the worst ever

1955.12 --> 1958.399
completely useless like there is

1957.679 --> 1962.3200000000002
literally

1958.399 --> 1966.08
no use other than this virtual [ __ ]

1962.32 --> 1967.2
idea global warming climate change co2

1966.08 --> 1970.6399999999999

absolute horse [ __ ]

1970.64 --> 1977.8400000000001
stupidest thing ever conceived

1977.9 --> 1982.489
[Music]

2007.44 --> 2019.8400000000001
all right

2027.36 --> 2033.84
oh man

2038.08 --> 2046.72
there is no globe exponential monk

2041.44 --> 2050.56
[ __ ] and solar energy is not

2046.72 --> 2053.04
that efficient doesn't work

2050.56 --> 2054.32
and you can't have some stupid little

2053.04 --> 2057.2
solar power thing

2054.32 --> 2059.04
in orbit around the earth so it would be

2057.2 --> 2062.0789999999997
in the full sunlight at all time

2059.04 --> 2063.04
yeah guess what that doesn't exist if it

2062.079 --> 2065.76
would have

2063.04 --> 2066.399
then yeah there should have been this

2065.76 --> 2068.96
giant

2066.399 --> 2069.839
electric plant solar plant that would be

2068.96 --> 2072.32
literally

2069.839 --> 2074.0789999999997
24 7 providing a lot of electrical

2072.32 --> 2075.839
energy using microwaves

2074.079 --> 2077.2000000000003
yeah the technology was already devised

2075.839 --> 2080.56
in the 90s

2077.2 --> 2084.0
yeah we know but guess what the earth

2080.56 --> 2087.2
is not a globe and orbits don't exist

2084.0 --> 2091.04
so it's all really cute

2087.2 --> 2094.6389999999997
but no solar energy is not going to be

2091.04 --> 2096.96
a 24 7 solar energy plan ever

2094.639 --> 2097.839
even though there should be if the earth

2096.96 --> 2102.8
was a globe

2097.839 --> 2105.999
but it's not isn't that unfortunate

2102.8 --> 2105.9990000000003
[Music]

2118.0 --> 2121.76
you probably never even heard about that

2122.079 --> 2126.96
because like the technological

2124.4 --> 2130.0
applications

2126.96 --> 2133.839
what we could do if the earth was a

2130.0 --> 2136.56
globe yeah giant amounts of

2133.839 --> 2137.92
really well thought out ideas that's

2136.56 --> 2141.68
right

2137.92 --> 2144.2400000000002
guess what the earth is not a globe

2141.68 --> 2145.52
and that's why those great ideas

2144.24 --> 2149.04
conceived

2145.52 --> 2149.68
never get put into practice because the

2149.04 --> 2158.32
earth

2149.68 --> 2162.24
is in the globe yeah isn't that just sad

2158.32 --> 2164.2400000000002
yeah max martin a 24 7 solar energy

2162.24 --> 2166.24
power plant

2164.24 --> 2167.4399999999996
yeah if the earth was a globe then you

2166.24 --> 2170.9599999999996
can simply put

2167.44 --> 2174.88
one of those in orbit in orbit

2170.96 --> 2178.64
flying around the earth in a 24-hour

2174.88 --> 2182.079
day cycle right so it would

2178.64 --> 2185.5989999999997
literally always be in the sun

2182.079 --> 2188.7200000000003
and then through microwave radiation

2185.599 --> 2191.28
it could send out the energy downward

2188.72 --> 2194.24
to the earth's surface to be yeah

2191.28 --> 2197.52
received by special receivers

2194.24 --> 2200.24
that technology was already devised in

2197.52 --> 2203.359
the 90s

2200.24 --> 2208.72
yes i remember even it being

2203.359 --> 2208.72
being brought up in freaking school

2210.96 --> 2214.32
how would you transfer the power through

2213.28 --> 2218.0
the air

2214.32 --> 2218.0
through microwave technology

2219.52 --> 2226.32
literally just pumping the electrics

2222.88 --> 2229.6800000000003
in the air through microwave

2226.32 --> 2232.48
and it is possible

2229.68 --> 2233.1189999999997
just like you would transfer wi-fi

2232.48 --> 2243.839
signals

2233.119 --> 2243.839
you could also just transfer electricity

2252.4 --> 2259.599
oh you didn't know that

2257.359 --> 2259.5989999999997
ah

2261.68 --> 2268.64
yeah that was possible 30 years ago

2266.32 --> 2270.079
but it's too difficult to go back to the

2268.64 --> 2273.5989999999997
moon because the technology

2270.079 --> 2275.119
used for that 50 years ago

2273.599 --> 2277.04
yeah they destroyed it it's too

2275.119 --> 2278.2400000000002
complicated to build something like that

2277.04 --> 2282.48
again

2278.24 --> 2286.24
but yeah you can actually transfer

2282.48 --> 2288.2400000000002
energy wirelessly in great quantities

2286.24 --> 2290.24
over a fast distance yeah that is

2288.24 --> 2293.04
technologically possible

2290.24 --> 2294.56
yet nobody's really interested in it

2293.04 --> 2297.52
because

2294.56 --> 2299.7599999999998
yeah if the worth of their globe then

2297.52 --> 2301.52
where are all these damn satellites

2299.76 --> 2304.079
catching sunlight 24

2301.52 --> 2305.599
7 and radiating it back to earth

2304.079 --> 2308.88
receiver so we'd have

2305.599 --> 2311.44
permanent cheap solar energy oh we don't

2308.88 --> 2313.28
we don't yeah it's because the earth is

2311.44 --> 2315.76
not a freaking globe and you can't have

2313.28 --> 2318.2400000000002
a 24 7 orbit

2315.76 --> 2320.7200000000003
facing the sun always that doesn't work

2318.24 --> 2320.72
that way

2321.52 --> 2324.88
like the best you could hope for is like

2323.359 --> 2328.24
a

2324.88 --> 2329.599
like a hovering plane that's just going

2328.24 --> 2333.2799999999997
to fly forever

2329.599 --> 2336.4
and then in that way try to absorb some

2333.28 --> 2338.88
solar energy like

2336.4 --> 2339.76
yeah a big floating solar panel

2338.88 --> 2343.44
basically

2339.76 --> 2345.0400000000004
and that could project some electricity

2343.44 --> 2346.88
downwards

2345.04 --> 2349.119
but that's never going to be the same

2346.88 --> 2353.2000000000003
skill because it yeah it has to be

2349.119 --> 2355.44
light to stay up there

2353.2 --> 2356.72
and it's going to cost energy to stay up

2355.44 --> 2359.52
there

2356.72 --> 2359.52
blimp no

2361.119 --> 2364.1600000000003
maybe a little

2364.48 --> 2370.56
maybe but the thing is

2367.76 --> 2372.8
it's never going to be as easy as with a

2370.56 --> 2375.52
supposed satellite

2372.8 --> 2378.0
that is just falling around the earth

2375.52 --> 2381.04
it's not costing any any energy for it

2378.0 --> 2397.52
to fall around the earth right

2381.04 --> 2400.64
too bad that that's impossible

2397.52 --> 2402.32
oh my god unfortunately you're actually

2400.64 --> 2404.48
defending that statement

2402.32 --> 2406.96
you're actually defending don pettit

2404.48 --> 2411.04
here are you

2406.96 --> 2414.56
it's that is just absurd man

2411.04 --> 2414.56
that is just absurd

2422.079 --> 2427.119
so explain to me right they made all

2425.68 --> 2429.5989999999997
these things by hand

2427.119 --> 2433.119
all of it right and we're talking about

2429.599 --> 2435.6800000000003
a big rocket thingy and ships and blah

2433.119 --> 2437.119
right well guess what a hundred years

2435.68 --> 2439.839
ago they would make

2437.119 --> 2442.319
cars exactly like that they would make

2439.839 --> 2444.7999999999997
every part by hand

2442.319 --> 2446.72
oh but it it's too difficult to to do

2444.8 --> 2448.5600000000004
that over again right because as

2446.72 --> 2450.48
factories are closed those people are no

2448.56 --> 2453.839
longer alive that used to do that

2450.48 --> 2457.359
so we can't do that anymore wrong

2453.839 --> 2459.44
we can it's not that hard

2457.359 --> 2461.359
just got a couple of people that are

2459.44 --> 2464.96
enthusia enthusiasts

2461.359 --> 2465.359
doing that then they will completely do

2464.96 --> 2468.0
it

2465.359 --> 2469.5989999999997
again and it will just build a freaking

2468.0 --> 2472.079
car

2469.599 --> 2473.2000000000003
from scratch the way they did it a

2472.079 --> 2475.04
hundred years ago

2473.2 --> 2477.1189999999997
because they can they can't figure it

2475.04 --> 2480.48
out it's not that difficult

2477.119 --> 2483.2000000000003
right so why then would it be

2480.48 --> 2486.0
too difficult too much of a hassle with

2483.2 --> 2488.96
this enormous nasa budget

2486.0 --> 2491.599
and millions of people working

2488.96 --> 2493.92
supposedly for nasa doing things right

2491.599 --> 2495.52
so why couldn't all those people and all

2493.92 --> 2498.16
that money get together to just

2495.52 --> 2499.839
figure out how they build it just as a

2498.16 --> 2502.0
monument piece you don't even have to

2499.839 --> 2505.359
send the damn thing into space

2502.0 --> 2508.0
just rebuild it as a museum prop how

2505.359 --> 2509.5989999999997
about that

2508.0 --> 2512.4
it's too difficult it can't do that

2509.599 --> 2515.28
that's absolutely [ __ ]

2512.4 --> 2515.28
like at this point

2515.44 --> 2520.56
computer design algorithms could simply

2518.56 --> 2524.0
scan the old stuff

2520.56 --> 2525.599
and then try to rebuild it just from the

2524.0 --> 2528.88
visuals

2525.599 --> 2531.119
and it would get pretty close maybe

2528.88 --> 2537.839
would fill in a lot of the work so it's

2531.119 --> 2537.839
just preposterous

2540.0 --> 2544.16
there is no excuse to say that they

2542.48 --> 2547.119
couldn't build it again

2544.16 --> 2549.52
because the level of the technology and

2547.119 --> 2550.0
the aerodynamics and everything that was

2549.52 --> 2554.0
a part

2550.0 --> 2556.0
of it are just open on record

2554.0 --> 2557.68
technological developments that are

2556.0 --> 2559.92
already outdated

2557.68 --> 2561.04
like they've already out it's already

2559.92 --> 2563.2000000000003
outdated

2561.04 --> 2564.079
they can already improved on the

2563.2 --> 2566.3999999999996
standard that

2564.079 --> 2567.28
they were utilizing in the design at the

2566.4 --> 2570.48
time

2567.28 --> 2573.599
so to say that they can't remake it

2570.48 --> 2577.599
is just ridiculous

2573.599 --> 2578.96
it is just ridiculous they can remake it

2577.599 --> 2580.88
and improve on it

2578.96 --> 2582.0
that's what they can do they're just not

2580.88 --> 2584.1600000000003
doing it

2582.0 --> 2585.92
because there's no use for it because it

2584.16 --> 2587.04
was only there to convince a bunch of

2585.92 --> 2588.56
boomers

2587.04 --> 2591.52
that there was such a thing as outer

2588.56 --> 2595.2
space and that you can land on the moon

2591.52 --> 2596.48
so that they could pay lifetime budget

2595.2 --> 2598.24
to nasa

2596.48 --> 2600.0
and everybody would love it because they

2598.24 --> 2601.1189999999997
had this dream that they went to the

2600.0 --> 2603.28
moon

2601.119 --> 2604.48
right that's why they're not going to

2603.28 --> 2605.92
rebuild it

2604.48 --> 2608.079
because they don't want to go there

2605.92 --> 2611.76
again they just

2608.079 --> 2613.44
want you to pay up that's the only thing

2611.76 --> 2621.8390000000004
they really want

2613.44 --> 2621.839
they're already getting paid up enough

2624.89 --> 2628.0699999999997
[Music]

2648.319 --> 2651.7599999999998
why don't you believe nasa well why do

2650.96 --> 2655.2
you believe

2651.76 --> 2655.2000000000003
nasa exponential monk

2656.96 --> 2664.96
what specifically makes you believe nasa

2661.92 --> 2664.96
why don't you answer that

2667.119 --> 2672.4
why don't you believe why do you believe

2669.839 --> 2674.96
nasa

2672.4 --> 2676.0
answer it i'm addressing you right now

2674.96 --> 2678.2400000000002
you better not have

2676.0 --> 2681.04
freaking muted me because then i'm just

2678.24 --> 2681.04
gonna ban you

2681.44 --> 2688.48
if you're in my chat you will listen

2684.96 --> 2689.76
to when i address you life or you will

2688.48 --> 2691.68
be banned

2689.76 --> 2694.7200000000003
are you hearing me exponential monk

2691.68 --> 2694.72
answer my question

2695.2 --> 2705.839
do not address soul you will address

2698.24 --> 2705.839
me arwen why do you believe in nasa

2729.68 --> 2735.44
oh and it grin it went silent surprise

2732.88 --> 2735.44
surprise

2735.52 --> 2739.44
maybe he's just looking up his database

2738.24 --> 2742.16
as prefab

2739.44 --> 2745.119
response nonsense trying to fabricate

2742.16 --> 2746.7999999999997
some kind of response to that

2745.119 --> 2748.319
because of course he can't just

2746.8 --> 2750.7200000000003
improvisingly say

2748.319 --> 2752.48
why he would believe nasa because no

2750.72 --> 2754.3999999999996
person in their right mind would believe

2752.48 --> 2757.599
nasa

2754.4 --> 2760.7200000000003
oh oh

2757.599 --> 2761.599
exponential monk so you responded to

2760.72 --> 2763.68
somebody else

2761.599 --> 2764.6400000000003
well that's means you're going to get

2763.68 --> 2768.8799999999997
the [ __ ]

2764.64 --> 2768.8799999999997
out of my chat [ __ ]

2769.04 --> 2772.96
i've been addressing you you were not

2771.04 --> 2774.72
listening that means you muted me

2772.96 --> 2777.44
that means you're now banned get the

2774.72 --> 2783.52
[ __ ] out of my room

2777.44 --> 2783.52
[ __ ] spamming [ __ ]

2784.16 --> 2788.3999999999996
if you're in my chat you better damn

2786.079 --> 2803.8390000000004
have it unmuted and listen to when i

2788.4 --> 2803.839
address you by name [ __ ]

2808.56 --> 2813.7599999999998
all right so

2811.599 --> 2816.079
i think i'm gonna round out the show

2813.76 --> 2818.079
it's a very short show today only 46

2816.079 --> 2821.44
minutes

2818.079 --> 2821.44
or at this time

2821.88 --> 2827.76
[Music]

2824.16 --> 2827.7599999999998
but it was a pretty good show

2829.359 --> 2845.839
and hey plenty of flat earth related

2831.599 --> 2845.839
subject that i brought up so

2852.8 --> 2856.0
no that's not what they said

2854.079 --> 2856.8
unfortunately reality they didn't use

2856.0 --> 2858.96
the word now

2856.8 --> 2861.2000000000003
they just said we can't go back because

2858.96 --> 2865.119
it's too tedious they did not say

2861.2 --> 2867.839
we cannot go back now they left that out

2865.119 --> 2869.04
so you are literally inserting a little

2867.839 --> 2872.0789999999997
word in there

2869.04 --> 2873.52
to add on to the meaning beyond what was

2872.079 --> 2876.6400000000003
originally said

2873.52 --> 2878.96
yeah maybe you shouldn't do that

2876.64 --> 2881.92
maybe you shouldn't add words to the

2878.96 --> 2881.92
statement they made

2882.64 --> 2886.0
yeah that's right they didn't say it

2884.559 --> 2890.96
that's right but they did

2886.0 --> 2890.96
say that they cannot go back

2892.0 --> 2897.76
they didn't give some kind of time

2895.04 --> 2900.0
to that they just said no we can't do it

2897.76 --> 2904.2400000000002
because it's too difficult to

2900.0 --> 2906.48
build that old severely outdated [ __ ]

2904.24 --> 2907.5989999999997
that we supposedly utilize in order to

2906.48 --> 2909.359
get there

2907.599 --> 2915.52
they just don't address it anymore

2909.359 --> 2916.88
that's the reality

2915.52 --> 2918.64
they couldn't this is they said they

2916.88 --> 2923.2000000000003
couldn't get past the van ellenberg

2918.64 --> 2926.16
except for when they actually did yeah

2923.2 --> 2926.7999999999997
when they actually did including buzz

2926.16 --> 2929.04
aldrin

2926.8 --> 2931.44
who went apparently right through it and

2929.04 --> 2933.52
back and he's still alive right now

2931.44 --> 2935.28
he's a little kooky but he's still

2933.52 --> 2938.96
perfectly alive

2935.28 --> 2941.6800000000003
he hasn't died off extreme cancers yet

2938.96 --> 2942.2400000000002
which you probably would if you went

2941.68 --> 2945.7599999999998
through

2942.24 --> 2948.8799999999997
an actual heavy radiation

2945.76 --> 2948.88
as they suggested

2949.839 --> 2954.5589999999997
right if radiation is enough to disrupt

2952.8 --> 2956.559
equipment

2954.559 --> 2958.4
then you better damn well believe it's
