good morning welcome to Flat Earth

42.699 --> 47.559
early-bird number 289 I'm your host

55.809 --> 60.209999999999994
I'm going live which is normally 2:00

57.97 --> 62.829
p.m. Amsterdam time every day also

60.21 --> 64.93
please support my show through the Super

62.829 --> 66.97
chats PayPal patreon and my GoFundMe

64.93 --> 75.18
that would be much appreciated

66.97 --> 79.509
so today the heat has finally subsided a

75.18 --> 82.649
little it's a like a cloudy day there's

79.509 --> 85.75
almost no direct sunlight at any point

82.649 --> 89.979
but it's lovely there's a nice cool

85.75 --> 93.729
breeze it still feels like summer but

89.979 --> 96.49
like just a nice cool pause and all that

93.729 --> 99.91
heat kind of moist though but not too

96.49 --> 104.47
bad there's been some really weird type

99.91 --> 108.16
of lightning storm going on it happened

104.47 --> 111.849
yes two days ago and yesterday don't see

108.16 --> 115.869
that too often it's very weird you see a

111.849 --> 119.8
lot of lightning but it doesn't seem to

115.869 --> 124.95
be lightning hitting the ground really

119.8 --> 128.07999999999998
and you barely hear it so it seems it

124.95 --> 133.0
especially two days ago in the evening

128.08 --> 136.75
there was just this one spot all roughly

133.0 --> 142.18
over there at Horizon above it and it

136.75 --> 144.22
would just flashing flashing it looked

142.18 --> 147.64000000000001
so weird because it stayed almost in

144.22 --> 151.569
exactly the same location or apparent

147.64 --> 154.29999999999998
location at least what is that some kind

151.569 --> 157.29999999999998
of weird unusual lightning storm going

154.3 --> 160.71900000000002
on without any sound or it was

157.3 --> 164.34900000000002
apparently very visible at a huge

160.719 --> 165.35999999999999
distance which would be not enough for

164.349 --> 168.42
the

165.36 --> 173.01000000000002
the sound wave to hit you eventually but

168.42 --> 177.10999999999999
still that well just so many so visible

173.01 --> 177.10999999999999
without barely any sound it was weird

178.4 --> 184.47
yeah and yeah yesterday that happened

181.44 --> 186.84
more straight across but didn't get

184.47 --> 190.74
pretty close and sometimes I did hear

186.84 --> 193.05
lightning but it wasn't raining or

190.74 --> 194.67000000000002
anything so it seemed like another type

193.05 --> 197.58
of lightning storm I wish I could have

194.67 --> 205.2
filmed it in a good way my webcam would

197.58 --> 210.18
have done it any good so today I got

205.2 --> 211.23
with me Tamera coffee this temperature

210.18 --> 217.83
is very doable

211.23 --> 221.04
I got another Illuminati cousin and the

217.83 --> 226.98000000000002
tangerine because I feel like tangerines

221.04 --> 228.84
this last week no tea though I got some

226.98 --> 233.04
lemonade in the in the cooler downstairs

228.84 --> 239.09
I might get that you know so let's see

233.04 --> 244.29
wasn't Chet lots of people EDM was first

292.41 --> 306.29
okay YouTube man

301.98 --> 306.29
I was up pretty late today

310.97 --> 321.03000000000003
that's just stupid maybe bended saw bent

317.79 --> 327.08000000000004
saw bended and Theo Megawati haven't

321.03 --> 327.08
seen you in a while hmm

332.999 --> 341.579
right yeah oh talking about that it was

336.959 --> 345.509
kind of weird because yesterday I was

341.579 --> 347.159
out on the roof and yeah smoking it was

345.509 --> 349.16900000000004
just delightful so I was just there I

347.159 --> 355.679
was really enjoying the evening a lot

349.169 --> 360.35999999999996
outside and then at some point I was

355.679 --> 366.68899999999996
facing what is it north or something and

360.36 --> 369.539
a lightning struck behind me and without

366.689 --> 371.84900000000005
sound again but so bright that it

369.539 --> 374.669
literally flashed it all so I could see

371.849 --> 377.61
my own shadow on the roof okay was

374.669 --> 382.289
pretty bright flash but it didn't hear

377.61 --> 384.059
any thunder afterwards just none but

382.289 --> 388.24899999999997
what I did notice is that as I was

384.059 --> 391.709
standing there having my backside like

388.249 --> 395.069
basically unprepared for that as the

391.709 --> 397.8
flash flashed I felt a click in the back

395.069 --> 401.459
of my head it was very weird and also

397.8 --> 404.61
suddenly my ears were attuned slightly

401.459 --> 406.589
different you know how that happens it's

404.61 --> 408.749
similar to when your ears pop it just

406.589 --> 413.189
closed me or something weird something

408.749 --> 416.249
different that happened but there was no

413.189 --> 418.40900000000005
sound so there was like bang and then

416.249 --> 421.199
yeah you can get overwhelmed from the

418.409 --> 423.329
sound and it yours your hearing is

421.199 --> 426.98900000000003
slightly different no it's just a flash

423.329 --> 430.439
I felt I literally felt a click in the

426.989 --> 432.739
back of my head and then my ears sounded

430.439 --> 435.329
slightly there it was weird

432.739 --> 437.549
it almost was like there was an

435.329 --> 439.369
electromagnetic shock wave going through

437.549 --> 447.679
me or something

439.369 --> 447.67900000000003
it didn't feel bad it just felt like

448.639 --> 457.729
like tension release out of nowhere it

452.0 --> 461.8
is weird it was a weird experience so

457.729 --> 466.099
yeah that happened I you know for such a

461.8 --> 469.759
basic life you could say I do get to

466.099 --> 472.15
experience really odd stuff that I guess

469.759 --> 478.55
most people wouldn't take notice of

472.15 --> 481.969
but with my senses and the small region

478.55 --> 484.789
to focus us on so I don't have much

481.969 --> 488.719
distraction by the body of everything I

484.789 --> 492.199
can observe I just tend to see unique

488.719 --> 494.9
thingies little weird elements happening

492.199 --> 499.46000000000004
and then remember them vividly so like

494.9 --> 503.06
this one it does really help that I feel

499.46 --> 506.35999999999996
stronger like I said yesterday because

503.06 --> 508.34
then suddenly my attention actually

506.36 --> 511.87
takes notice of this type of thing again

508.34 --> 511.86999999999995
and it's interesting

513.78 --> 516.9599999999999
[Music]

521.77 --> 524.88
okay fine each

527.47 --> 533.74
what reset when is this reset gonna be

530.65 --> 536.68
why are you constantly gambling on some

533.74 --> 537.7
kind of weird a theory or reset to

536.68 --> 542.26
change everything

537.7 --> 547.12
sounds like apocalyptic wishes you know

542.26 --> 552.97
I don't I I don't even I'm not trying to

547.12 --> 555.7
be mean but it I regard that way of

552.97 --> 558.76
viewing things as a problem it's just a

555.7 --> 561.58
burden and it's not constructive back in

558.76 --> 565.5699999999999
the day I did believe apocalyptic things

561.58 --> 569.4100000000001
in the sense that even during the 2000

565.57 --> 571.96
scare I was I really was nervous

569.41 --> 574.6899999999999
something bad what happened didn't of

571.96 --> 576.94
course but I was really nervous about it

574.69 --> 578.5300000000001
it's the first time I was really nervous

576.94 --> 579.1300000000001
that something really bad was gonna

578.53 --> 587.04
happen

579.13 --> 591.58
and then in 2012 well yeah I was sick

587.04 --> 594.9399999999999
about it because everybody I was talking

591.58 --> 600.94
to they were all almost panicking about

594.94 --> 603.61
that [ __ ] it was so hyped up and I

600.94 --> 607.48
really thought that yeah this is the end

603.61 --> 612.28
or something wasn't something did happen

607.48 --> 614.44
though but maybe it is because all the

612.28 --> 617.92
attentions were all drawn into one

614.44 --> 624.6400000000001
direction and then when it stopped

617.92 --> 626.77
suddenly everything changed people would

624.64 --> 630.37
take other directions than they would

626.77 --> 632.5889999999999
normally because they got out of a

630.37 --> 634.3
certain rusted position that they

632.589 --> 636.7
wouldn't normally get out of it was

634.3 --> 639.8199999999999
because they expect at the end that they

636.7 --> 642.97
all or a lot of people basically broke

639.82 --> 645.85
out of their normal routine expecting

642.97 --> 647.61
the end and then after that didn't

645.85 --> 651.25
happen

647.61 --> 654.28
people suddenly noticed they had this

651.25 --> 657.28
freedom to to do things differently a

654.28 --> 659.53
lot of them I think and that kind of

657.28 --> 661.27
changed the whole landscape so maybe

659.53 --> 665.02
that is kind of a reset of

661.27 --> 667.5
actively it seemed to be for me for me

665.02 --> 674.38
everything after that was just like I

667.5 --> 677.02
literally had nothing I hadn't I I

674.38 --> 679.63
really believed that it was gonna be the

677.02 --> 682.39
end of me somehow and I

679.63 --> 687.37
yeah if when you totally aim for that

682.39 --> 689.74
and then you realize it's not true and

687.37 --> 693.37
I'm not gonna make it true you know I'm

689.74 --> 695.17
not that freaking obsessed with my ideas

693.37 --> 697.96
I've never allowed that mechanism to

695.17 --> 700.24
even be able to manifest ever ever not

697.96 --> 702.6700000000001
even a single time you know not a single

700.24 --> 706.69
attempt for whatever reason okay no

702.67 --> 709.63
matter how shitty I can feel but after

706.69 --> 713.11
that is just like there's nothing and

709.63 --> 716.29
I'm just being faced with everything

713.11 --> 720.13
that I've done and what I'm left with as

716.29 --> 722.77
a result and that made me kind of feel

720.13 --> 726.37
really shitty because it felt like I

722.77 --> 729.43
wasted so much it was a tough pill to

726.37 --> 731.23
swallow that it wasn't yet so I'm trying

729.43 --> 733.9899999999999
to heat people that are constantly

731.23 --> 736.78
thinking oh reset already said all the

733.99 --> 739.21
apocalypse all oh it's all going to blow

736.78 --> 743.11
up all the meteors gonna strike it's all

739.21 --> 746.59
the same thing it's actually escapism an

743.11 --> 751.48
escapist mindset mechanism that is

746.59 --> 756.73
actively being used and abused mostly by

751.48 --> 760.63
media by cultures by the need for

756.73 --> 763.6
certain habits to get some steam off or

760.63 --> 766.36
distract you it slipped in and it can be

763.6 --> 771.25
found everywhere and it's escapism it's

766.36 --> 773.02
literally not really being confident not

771.25 --> 778.09
really knowing what to do with the

773.02 --> 780.67
future so much that you're then dragged

778.09 --> 784.6600000000001
into some kind of much more extreme

780.67 --> 789.28
final thing in your mind which seems

784.66 --> 791.4399999999999
pure in the face of the mess you feel

789.28 --> 794.019
doesn't mean that it actually is a mess

791.44 --> 801.9590000000001
but that you feel you've made that's the

794.019 --> 804.699
escapists mechanism I've been there so

801.959 --> 807.25
yeah other people have said it before

804.699 --> 809.769
you know it's like Oh fear poured all

807.25 --> 812.889
the doom all this that Owen Benjamin

809.769 --> 814.689
even talks about it well this is I'm

812.889 --> 816.91
pretty confident I'm pretty satisfied

814.689 --> 821.819
with how I put it down this is what that

816.91 --> 826.329
is it's literally escapism from your own

821.819 --> 829.17
bad feelings about where you're going or

826.329 --> 832.4799999999999
yeah the lack of the plan they're off

829.17 --> 836.41
probably for a lot of people for me also

832.48 --> 839.1700000000001
just not getting a grip on the situation

836.41 --> 843.55
on your situation on your problems on

839.17 --> 847.329
your wait to proceed and then you start

843.55 --> 851.139
to go into escapist mode and drag in

847.329 --> 854.019
some kind of occupational therapy which

851.139 --> 856.0600000000001
could perhaps be globe figuring out the

854.019 --> 859.8100000000001
globe defending to go or even Flat Earth

856.06 --> 862.8389999999999
escape just through the through the

859.81 --> 865.569
bidding but for a lot of people it's

862.839 --> 867.759
simply they get obsessed with doom with

865.569 --> 870.069
some kind of doom that somebody said and

867.759 --> 872.7090000000001
they believed it and then they're there

870.069 --> 876.279
man mind keep stuck on that to distract

872.709 --> 879.6099999999999
them to kind of give them an excuse not

876.279 --> 882.81
really to look at what else they got and

879.61 --> 882.8100000000001
to build on that

886.49 --> 892.58
I hope that was informative I had a good

890.57 --> 895.94
telephone call with my healer too by the

892.58 --> 899.3000000000001
by the way before this so that that may

895.94 --> 899.9300000000001
be part of the inspiration and really

899.3 --> 902.4499999999999
good talk

899.93 --> 906.76
cleared some things up and again he

902.45 --> 906.76
basically confirmed everything I thought

912.19 --> 922.2800000000001
the Holy Ghost is well I'm not

919.19 --> 926.87
necessarily tying in any biblical things

922.28 --> 928.8199999999999
into what I do you know you could

926.87 --> 931.4
compare it but there are so many

928.82 --> 933.83
complexities to the Bible so you can't

931.4 --> 943.5799999999999
just simply compare anything you do to

933.83 --> 946.37
it really that much you could but I'm

943.58 --> 952.73
not laying any kind of claim of divinity

946.37 --> 955.24
here I just have good moments where

952.73 --> 958.3100000000001
things are more clear to me and I just

955.24 --> 962.1800000000001
seem to get a better grip on why people

958.31 --> 964.3399999999999
don't understand certain things and in

962.18 --> 966.7399999999999
what format they need to have it

964.34 --> 969.47
presented in order for things to sink in

966.74 --> 973.79
more quickly for it to click that's my

969.47 --> 975.74
main focus is very sensitive ethereal

973.79 --> 978.86
thing I'm focusing on the frequencies

975.74 --> 981.4
again it's the same thing I do with the

978.86 --> 984.59
Bible it's about the frequencies about

981.4 --> 990.5799999999999
what is really going on what does it

984.59 --> 990.58
really what's really happening

993.03 --> 1005.04
[Music]

995.26 --> 1005.04
anyway right so

1009.89 --> 1024.939
ah man I was up very late yesterday it

1020.06 --> 1029.839
was really late probably a lot of people

1024.939 --> 1034.189
because I ran t know Trish Blythe I did

1029.839 --> 1037.1889999999999
not I I don't have look there's an issue

1034.189 --> 1042.76
with the superjet its first of all

1037.189 --> 1045.53
delayed and then I literally almost at

1042.76 --> 1050.27
95% at least have to pay it back

1045.53 --> 1054.5
afterward and I'm not gonna take a chunk

1050.27 --> 1057.23
out of my eating money to get a Bible

1054.5 --> 1059.33
that's why I asked for people to send it

1057.23 --> 1063.38
to me I literally gave my real address

1059.33 --> 1070.79
here in chat because I I would like one

1063.38 --> 1075.2800000000002
but at this point it is a luxury item to

1070.79 --> 1079.24
me the actual physical object that is

1075.28 --> 1083.32
not the concept not what it stands for

1079.24 --> 1083.32
take that very seriously

1088.85 --> 1096.1799999999998
now I don't have a physical Bible I do

1091.53 --> 1102.36
have some online things that I download

1096.18 --> 1104.8500000000001
it but I don't know I I can't seem to

1102.36 --> 1110.9099999999999
work with it properly I get very

1104.85 --> 1112.59
confused about it that way I think those

1110.91 --> 1118.8000000000002
internet tools would probably work

1112.59 --> 1120.9299999999998
better if somebody had too distracting

1118.8 --> 1123.96
me yeah if somebody already knew the

1120.93 --> 1125.91
Bible the actual paper version then it

1123.96 --> 1127.6200000000001
would probably work out really well for

1125.91 --> 1130.5900000000001
them they would probably be able to

1127.62 --> 1134.34
orientate in those online type system

1130.59 --> 1137.52
structures much better I'm not and so I

1134.34 --> 1139.56
do kind of want the physical thing but I

1137.52 --> 1142.74
just haven't come across it yet

1139.56 --> 1148.19
I really haven't well from the point

1142.74 --> 1152.07
that I did become a Christian in spirit

1148.19 --> 1154.55
which is now four years ago five years

1152.07 --> 1154.55
ago

1168.07 --> 1170.609
yeah

1176.48 --> 1186.38
man you know Karen B that's kind of

1181.28 --> 1188.6299999999999
interesting I would in a way I still

1186.38 --> 1190.7900000000002
consider them kind of as luxury items

1188.63 --> 1199.43
but it would be kinda cool to have like

1190.79 --> 1201.62
all those really big books to just have

1199.43 --> 1204.29
like a small library with all the

1201.62 --> 1211.1299999999999
significant religious books around the

1204.29 --> 1215.3
world just all of them oh you'd always

1211.13 --> 1217.43
just take anything and check it out and

1215.3 --> 1219.77
then if it reminds you of something else

1217.43 --> 1224.5
could pair it could be so fascinating to

1219.77 --> 1224.5
do but I'm not there yet anyway

1230.53 --> 1233.71
[Music]

1237.51 --> 1240.51
so

1242.08 --> 1249.61
yeah I agree Karen B and look in the

1247.12 --> 1252.4599999999998
time that I did go to the church right

1249.61 --> 1258.58
here across the street and I did go

1252.46 --> 1261.13
there at least two years I I had a very

1258.58 --> 1264.1299999999999
good time and all of them had their

1261.13 --> 1267.46
Bibles and I read some of it there were

1264.13 --> 1269.7700000000002
even like Bible reading class like

1267.46 --> 1272.32
things I kind of appreciated that so I

1269.77 --> 1275.8899999999999
did all kinds of things with the Bible

1272.32 --> 1281.2
old New Testament and the Bruegel

1275.89 --> 1283.7800000000002
Moorabbin it I did definitely get the

1281.2 --> 1286.45
feel for it and the funny thing was is

1283.78 --> 1289.12
that I could even reference and predict

1286.45 --> 1290.41
certain because I was so into it over

1289.12 --> 1295.06
there and because the field the energy

1290.41 --> 1299.8000000000002
was so good so pure I would be able to

1295.06 --> 1301.3899999999999
actually tie in things even though I've

1299.8 --> 1304.0
literally never read the whole thing

1301.39 --> 1307.99
just from everything I've heard because

1304.0 --> 1310.69
I feel that I do get it at least to

1307.99 --> 1314.6200000000001
certain levels just intuitively I

1310.69 --> 1322.06
definitely do get it yeah I know Trish

1314.62 --> 1324.08
flight can you please stop being so like

1322.06 --> 1327.6589999999999
this please

1324.08 --> 1330.6899999999998
stop telling me things you think I need

1327.659 --> 1332.46
to know or that otherwise I am is taking

1330.69 --> 1335.789
and going to hell please stop that

1332.46 --> 1339.929
okay I know I know what I'm talking

1335.789 --> 1346.519
about I'm not asking you to be my

1339.929 --> 1346.519
teacher okay don't act like that please

1348.559 --> 1355.4289999999999
the student chooses the teacher not the

1351.72 --> 1355.429
other way around okay

1355.909 --> 1362.159
and if there is any kind of Bible

1359.879 --> 1366.48
teacher that I as a student would

1362.159 --> 1375.6290000000001
actually take on it would be Paula Bible

1366.48 --> 1377.129
literalist at this moment at least I

1375.629 --> 1383.1899999999998
don't know what she thinks about it

1377.129 --> 1385.649
maybe she'd leave I don't know but I've

1383.19 --> 1390.269
followed her for quite some time and

1385.649 --> 1394.4289999999999
I've always been ya fascinated with

1390.269 --> 1394.429
everything that she's teaching so

1401.81 --> 1409.12
done Mormon God God it's God it's got

1406.31 --> 1412.82
its the creator Trish Blythe and

1409.12 --> 1416.06
whatever may be in some way twisted or

1412.82 --> 1425.09
politicized within it or inserted

1416.06 --> 1431.2
somehow it's still God okay you know how

1425.09 --> 1431.1999999999998
many is just you just don't get it

1437.65 --> 1444.68
this this polarized again it's the

1442.4 --> 1448.0900000000001
switchboard you're using the switch it's

1444.68 --> 1452.15
not about the switchboard it's about

1448.09 --> 1457.28
getting it exactly right or making

1452.15 --> 1460.94
mistakes evading or breaking that's what

1457.28 --> 1463.1
it's not Oh only only this freakin

1460.94 --> 1465.56
little book in this specific location

1463.1 --> 1468.8
with that group of people is the right

1465.56 --> 1470.96
thing and everyone else don't know what

1468.8 --> 1474.53
they're doing and they constantly need

1470.96 --> 1478.28
to be corrected because the holy duty to

1474.53 --> 1481.97
constantly push everyone around with

1478.28 --> 1487.25
your very specific point of view that's

1481.97 --> 1491.5
just it's spiritually offensive it

1487.25 --> 1491.5
really is stop it

1496.12 --> 1498.9899999999998
you don't know

1503.51 --> 1512.179
wise men knows that they barely know

1508.26 --> 1512.179
anything or nothing if you will

1529.07 --> 1536.6899999999998
right I deal with the creator and

1532.37 --> 1541.1599999999999
creation and all that ties in with it

1536.69 --> 1544.0700000000002
and I think Jesus did definitely tie in

1541.16 --> 1547.6100000000001
with that in a very significant way but

1544.07 --> 1550.07
I don't think he's the only one he is in

1547.61 --> 1553.9699999999998
my opinion the most critical one the one

1550.07 --> 1558.77
that changed the whole spiritual

1553.97 --> 1563.42
landscape and allowed pretty narrow

1558.77 --> 1567.26
unique things to come into being that in

1563.42 --> 1568.52
any other way would just never the

1567.26 --> 1572.48
creation would never have achieved

1568.52 --> 1575.06
anything close to what became possible

1572.48 --> 1580.04
because of Jesus because of that

1575.06 --> 1582.31
decision from the Creator okay just so

1580.04 --> 1582.31
you know

1588.74 --> 1601.3990000000001
a gamer mark YouTube guests sure I'm

1599.51 --> 1609.919
open to all kinds of guests I'm even

1601.399 --> 1615.1
yeah you know if you want to contact me

1609.919 --> 1617.72
you can still do so on on skype the

1615.1 --> 1621.83
address is in the description box below

1617.72 --> 1627.8600000000001
you can add me there we can talk if yeah

1621.83 --> 1629.75
you can share some things or propose

1627.86 --> 1631.61
coming on the show with a specific

1629.75 --> 1633.11
subject hey if you want to add if you

1631.61 --> 1635.6899999999998
have some kind of presentation to give

1633.11 --> 1639.4399999999998
I'm even up for that it's all fine

1635.69 --> 1643.69
whatever is convenient to you as long as

1639.44 --> 1643.69
it's interesting you're welcome

1656.45 --> 1665.749
all right Karen B that's that's the very

1661.82 --> 1670.009
much over-generalized but still true way

1665.749 --> 1671.809
to say it it's interesting how that

1670.009 --> 1678.739
works right

1671.809 --> 1680.629
and besides religion the real path of

1678.739 --> 1684.259
Christ and the teachings of Christ it's

1680.629 --> 1690.139
not about the religion absolutely not he

1684.259 --> 1693.259
opposed it he opposed a church a power

1690.139 --> 1696.9699999999998
structure it was about the individual it

1693.259 --> 1701.029
was about the individual knowledge

1696.97 --> 1705.499
realization and struggle with the ego

1701.029 --> 1709.279
with with the earthly gripping you down

1705.499 --> 1712.34
keeping it up and they have Rudolf

1709.279 --> 1714.529
Steiner by the way got that perfectly it

1712.34 --> 1717.559
so that resonated with me very much

1714.529 --> 1720.139
that's why I still definitely also

1717.559 --> 1723.35
follow those teachings because it is the

1720.139 --> 1727.0089999999998
spiritual approach they get Christ they

1723.35 --> 1728.9599999999998
get the path exactly yeah your body is

1727.009 --> 1731.57
the church that's right but there are

1728.96 --> 1734.269
consequences because of that with

1731.57 --> 1737.23
religion and that is that religion are

1734.269 --> 1744.23
basically power structures using

1737.23 --> 1746.629
knowledge using tricks of enlightenment

1744.23 --> 1750.409
all kinds of things that are all good

1746.629 --> 1754.6689999999999
tools but they use it to maintain a

1750.409 --> 1757.97
power structures they build in corners

1754.669 --> 1760.94
and doors within the whole body of

1757.97 --> 1763.309
knowledge to stop the free wandering

1760.94 --> 1766.779
within it and dictate in how to

1763.309 --> 1771.289
interpret certain things turning the

1766.779 --> 1774.94
making an effective real road through a

1771.289 --> 1778.85
book like this is how we in the church

1774.94 --> 1781.009
interpret these things it's a very

1778.85 --> 1783.23
specific way of interpreting what is

1781.009 --> 1785.989
going through a certain book while there

1783.23 --> 1789.23
could be potentially hundreds of ways to

1785.989 --> 1790.4
interpret that book and that is part of

1789.23 --> 1794.029
religion

1790.4 --> 1797.8090000000002
it is taking the true knowledge and then

1794.029 --> 1801.5
narrowing it down putting blindfolds on

1797.809 --> 1803.3899999999999
the people that go through it and then

1801.5 --> 1807.02
basically telling them what they should

1803.39 --> 1811.5490000000002
be interpreting out of it and therefore

1807.02 --> 1814.549
taking away their own yeah their bind it

1811.549 --> 1817.19
bound they become bound they become

1814.549 --> 1821.09
enslaved to another person and that is

1817.19 --> 1822.44
just there's exactly wrong it's exactly

1821.09 --> 1827.0
what you're not supposed to be doing

1822.44 --> 1831.6490000000001
according to Christ so all religion

1827.0 --> 1836.2
technically does very structural systems

1831.649 --> 1839.12
that it incorporates goes in the face

1836.2 --> 1844.039
most of it anyway in the face of what

1839.12 --> 1847.4599999999998
Christ teaches a real church should not

1844.039 --> 1851.27
even be a place a real church should be

1847.46 --> 1859.809
a group of people that just naturally

1851.27 --> 1859.809
gather that's it that could be anything

1863.63 --> 1868.5700000000002
no thanks let earth for life

1871.66 --> 1880.789
[Music]

1892.26 --> 1903.85
right but the real problem with a church

1898.35 --> 1909.6399999999999
or rather with religion is the hierarchy

1903.85 --> 1917.4699999999998
and it's almost inevitable yeah sorry

1909.64 --> 1925.8700000000001
hey LMB long time no see yeah you can

1917.47 --> 1931.15
buy ranches anymore nope it's it's out

1925.87 --> 1933.6399999999999
of there it's just been turned into lame

1931.15 --> 1936.21
joke so I'm simply just not handing out

1933.64 --> 1939.0700000000002
wrenches anymore unless I feel like it

1936.21 --> 1941.52
Hey missed opportunity you thought it

1939.07 --> 1946.0
would trolling it would be more fun well

1941.52 --> 1947.92
that's what happens you troll it out of

1946.0 --> 1953.07
existence it was your opportunity not

1947.92 --> 1953.0700000000002
mine anyway

1953.55 --> 1962.8899999999999
losing track here all right we're search

1959.61 --> 1965.1699999999998
okay the problem is is with where

1962.89 --> 1969.73
religion comes in is when there is a

1965.17 --> 1972.22
group of people that could all be

1969.73 --> 1975.6100000000001
Christians and they come together and

1972.22 --> 1978.1000000000001
then at some point for some reason by

1975.61 --> 1984.51
way of seduction by way of the earthly

1978.1 --> 1989.1999999999998
influences they may decide upon a leader

1984.51 --> 1992.65
for practical purposes because one of

1989.2 --> 1994.78
them seems of stronger individual for

1992.65 --> 1997.77
some reason and wiser than all these

1994.78 --> 2001.01
things and that is where it starts

1997.77 --> 2006.51
because that is the first step into

2001.01 --> 2009.6
forming a religious hierarchy people for

2006.51 --> 2011.85
whatever reason give some kind of

2009.6 --> 2014.1899999999998
authority to another individual where

2011.85 --> 2017.1
they are no longer equal within the

2014.19 --> 2020.3700000000001
group but they become subject by their

2017.1 --> 2022.86
own decision that is where it is no

2020.37 --> 2028.32
Randy you're not bad

2022.86 --> 2031.7099999999998
hmm and that's where it starts and it's

2028.32 --> 2033.72
almost inevitable to happen it's it's

2031.71 --> 2036.029
much harder for everyone to stay

2033.72 --> 2039.96
individuals in a giant group of

2036.029 --> 2042.919
individuals and not naturally wanting to

2039.96 --> 2042.919
form a hierarchy

2062.57 --> 2070.429
is that the same as Nathan and all his

2065.48 --> 2077.72
minions well I'm pretty sure that's not

2070.429 --> 2080.7200000000003
a religious Church everybody in the

2077.72 --> 2085.85
panel there including myself is in there

2080.72 --> 2089.0299999999997
for their own reasons no Karen BJ's

2085.85 --> 2093.88
McLeod is not banned not as far as I

2089.03 --> 2093.88
know I didn't ban him

2098.8 --> 2102.86
wait let me double check I don't know

2101.12 --> 2105.91
maybe people have been screwing around

2102.86 --> 2105.9100000000003
and ranches I

2121.86 --> 2126.8
I did see a couple of ace McLeod's in my

2127.34 --> 2135.6800000000003
in my pan list but I thought those were

2129.95 --> 2135.68
obvious socks let me check it again

2147.8 --> 2150.4300000000003
No

2150.67 --> 2154.7400000000002
no I know he's not bad

2161.23 --> 2163.92
No

2173.39 --> 2181.31
this well did he say that Lodi are you

2177.14 --> 2183.5899999999997
sure I didn't stick around for the whole

2181.31 --> 2189.2
thing so eventually I just had to go to

2183.59 --> 2198.82
bed but but yeah

2189.2 --> 2198.8199999999997
Nathan was kind of on fire as they say

2231.21 --> 2241.079
yeah well it was kind of weird yesterday

2235.23 --> 2241.65
I have to admit that just George is such

2241.079 --> 2246.0890000000004
it

2241.65 --> 2250.2200000000003
he really is kind of a weasel sniffling

2246.089 --> 2255.599
kind of guy just a weirdo yeah

2250.22 --> 2258.8999999999996
and just this isn't the whole thing

2255.599 --> 2262.079
about him neurotically shaving his face

2258.9 --> 2264.4100000000003
like that it was just what the hell so

2262.079 --> 2264.4100000000003
weird

2267.44 --> 2275.15
so yeah Nathan was kind of using very

2272.309 --> 2282.559
violent psychological tactics to break

2275.15 --> 2286.319
through the psychological fortress that

2282.559 --> 2293.0690000000004
George had and it's very violent very

2286.319 --> 2295.859
ugly and George is also yeah very much

2293.069 --> 2299.549
the same way except yeah because nathan

2295.859 --> 2301.65
was putting on the full force there's

2299.549 --> 2303.42
just no way he can compete with that so

2301.65 --> 2304.2000000000003
he then turned to the more like a

2303.42 --> 2306.359
victims

2304.2 --> 2308.1899999999996
yeah first he tried like oh yeah he

2306.359 --> 2311.67
owned Athens just going crazy and then

2308.19 --> 2317.069
kind of almost went into victim status

2311.67 --> 2321.4500000000003
about it it's just I was it was pretty

2317.069 --> 2323.64
crazy display really and the craziest

2321.45 --> 2329.2799999999997
thing about it is that George actually

2323.64 --> 2332.54
just hung around that was probably the

2329.28 --> 2332.5400000000004
craziest thing about it

2349.74 --> 2354.9399999999996
[Music]

2351.94 --> 2354.94

2365.25 --> 2368.45

2700.9 --> 2705.96
rettner Stefan hey listen if you would

2702.82 --> 2709.3
be so kind to send it to my email or

2705.96 --> 2711.69
somehow get it over on skype that would

2709.3 --> 2711.69
be fun

2728.82 --> 2733.61
I already explained to you Trish Blythe

2734.48 --> 2741.06
okay you use the superjet because you

2737.73 --> 2744.9900000000002
wanted a highlighted message with how I

2741.06 --> 2747.48
must get a Bible right and that all

2744.99 --> 2749.37
you're basically trying to bribe me to

2747.48 --> 2752.01
get a Bible but what you don't realize

2749.37 --> 2754.56
is that I don't get that money really

2752.01 --> 2757.5200000000004
I've already explained this on my

2754.56 --> 2757.52
hangouts earlier

2762.45 --> 2772.74
it it yeah it just gets shaft off in the

2769.91 --> 2777.049
squared off against my social welfare in

2772.74 --> 2777.049
the end so I already told everyone

2778.01 --> 2782.9100000000003
unless it is huge amounts and then it

2781.019 --> 2785.4599999999996
may actually make a big difference but

2782.91 --> 2787.6189999999997
I'm dead people aren't doing that and

2785.46 --> 2790.0190000000002
while Sam in kind of did that one time

2787.619 --> 2792.809
that kind of made a difference really

2790.019 --> 2796.529
but yeah if you really want to make a

2792.809 --> 2801.23
difference do it through Pay Pal that's

2796.529 --> 2801.23
why I say that every now and then

2844.81 --> 2847.65
mmm

2886.14 --> 2892.2889999999998
all right well this is obviously not

2891.269 --> 2896.49
going anywhere

2892.289 --> 2898.349
since there's mostly just trolls being

2896.49 --> 2900.18
active and people that are being very

2898.349 --> 2903.3900000000003
complaining pants about a lot of things

2900.18 --> 2907.95
and ranty who is being surprisingly

2903.39 --> 2910.549
normal in compared comparison to

2907.95 --> 2910.549
everyone else

2916.26 --> 2920.96
so welcome back to chat Randy

2927.48 --> 2930.63
[Music]

2944.869 --> 2947.92
yeah Lottie

2948.89 --> 2962.18
stop trolling me stop it getting really

2954.259 --> 2964.16
freaking annoying so yeah I I think I'm

2962.18 --> 2967.8689999999997
gonna round out the show it's gonna be

2964.16 --> 2967.8689999999997
somewhat of a short one

2968.979 --> 2982.759
and I don't know if if if this is gonna

2977.839 --> 2987.049
persist because you lot they're even

2982.759 --> 2990.529
handing in with the rest your kid you're

2987.049 --> 2994.219
you're keeping the pushing going on okay

2990.529 --> 2997.519
and if you keep that up I will just ban

2994.219 --> 3000.759
you again I I've really in this sound so

2997.519 --> 3002.6499999999996
Oh probably to you it sounds incredibly

3000.759 --> 3005.829
two-faced because you're stuck on the

3002.65 --> 3008.469
other side in that mindset here but I've

3005.829 --> 3012.549
been incredibly tolerant of this [ __ ]

3008.469 --> 3014.89
okay as for the super chat I didn't ask

3012.549 --> 3018.64
for that literally did not

3014.89 --> 3021.219
I don't need super jet I asked for a

3018.64 --> 3026.229
Bible if you want me to have Bible then

3021.219 --> 3028.9
send me a Bible then following that up

3026.229 --> 3031.18
with a super chat message telling me I

3028.9 --> 3033.4300000000003
can't do that here is money

3031.18 --> 3036.339
yeah that doesn't work cuz I already

3033.43 --> 3039.459
told everyone here that I practically

3036.339 --> 3045.16
don't get anything from that and I'm not

3039.459 --> 3049.769
gonna cut away a piece of my food in

3045.16 --> 3049.769
order to get that it's a luxury item and

3050.4 --> 3056.319
indeed if I really needed to look

3053.41 --> 3059.999
something up I could do it online if

3056.319 --> 3064.239
necessary and I'd love to have a book

3059.999 --> 3068.4399999999996

3112.29 --> 3118.65
Nathan's behavior was not Christian

3114.93 --> 3121.0499999999997
okay Nathan's never claimed even to be a

3118.65 --> 3124.2000000000003
Christian he's done some crazy [ __ ] with

3121.05 --> 3126.869

3255.44 --> 3261.109
nice somebody had supported me at some

3257.54 --> 3265.99
point here but I understand that that

3261.109 --> 3269.7999999999997
you don't feel like it right that's fine

3265.99 --> 3269.7999999999997
you'll figure it out

3271.329 --> 3274.679
I don't know

3275.589 --> 3288.64
