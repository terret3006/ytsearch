the weather has turned around again

80.0 --> 85.36
switch

80.479 --> 88.799
back to beautiful

85.36 --> 89.52
such a clear sky still a little moist in

88.799 --> 92.72000000000001
the air

89.52 --> 96.0
as you can see by it being a little

92.72 --> 101.03999999999999
lighter blue at the horizon but

96.0 --> 105.36
yeah there's no clouds at all currently

101.04 --> 105.36000000000001
airplane flying there not leaving a uh

105.439 --> 113.67999999999999
a long trail so it's dissolving

110.159 --> 114.07900000000001
probably just moist yeah looking really

113.68 --> 117.92
good

114.079 --> 121.36
nice the wind is also kind of warm it's

117.92 --> 125.759
it's really just summer again

121.36 --> 129.2
and people are all over

125.759 --> 134.08
the parks

129.2 --> 134.07999999999998
streets down here

134.56 --> 143.28
playing with their pets and all that

136.879 --> 146.879
it's amazing

143.28 --> 148.48
i gave the birds a fresh bowl of water

146.879 --> 151.84
and some bread and the water

148.48 --> 154.16
yeah they already started washing in it

151.84 --> 157.84
so it's already almost gone like within

154.16 --> 157.84
half an hour

165.84 --> 171.84
all right let's see what's the

169.04 --> 171.84
temperature

174.08 --> 179.20000000000002
22 degrees right so it's right back up

176.959 --> 179.20000000000002
there

180.08 --> 185.68
it's cut nice nice temperature not too

182.72 --> 189.92
hot and too sweaty

185.68 --> 189.92000000000002
hey hello good servant first in chat

191.04 --> 199.84
welcome on this sunday the

194.159 --> 199.84
6th of june 2021

202.4 --> 207.12
asked a friend to come and watch all

204.56 --> 207.12
right cool

210.84 --> 213.84
hello

214.959 --> 218.08
so thankfully i did make some notes

216.959 --> 221.12
yesterday

218.08 --> 225.04000000000002
i've been feeling so much better since

221.12 --> 225.04
my jaw is no longer distracting me

225.28 --> 230.4
although i do notice that because of

227.12 --> 232.64000000000001
that the like the emergency mechanisms

230.4 --> 236.87900000000002
have been removed but now kind of my

232.64 --> 238.79899999999998
tension gone back up onto my jaw because

236.879 --> 240.959
when i'm like really in the flow that

238.799 --> 243.439
does kind of happen

240.959 --> 243.439
as well

244.879 --> 248.159
but overall doing great

250.08 --> 257.35900000000004
saturday was yeah crowded with streams

255.439 --> 261.44
after the flat earth early bird show i

257.359 --> 261.44
watched some owen benjamin and bit shoot

263.199 --> 270.40000000000003
dell also went live

266.8 --> 274.639
there was a lot of spirit in the air

270.4 --> 276.79999999999995
uh and later on martin litka also went

274.639 --> 280.88
live

276.8 --> 283.84000000000003
had a flattery night typical good stuff

280.88 --> 283.84
uh

286.16 --> 291.84000000000003
yeah i thought of some new ideas uh i

289.28 --> 297.84
scribbled them down pretty poorly

291.84 --> 297.84
let me try to decipher what i wrote down

299.04 --> 304.639
oh right yeah yeah a little joke

302.479 --> 306.8
you know the narrative the new one

304.639 --> 310.08
involving with vaccines and now this is

306.8 --> 312.96000000000004
not completely without danger but to me

310.08 --> 314.08
the shedding right i think that the

312.96 --> 317.59999999999997
shedding idea

314.08 --> 317.59999999999997
is still based on viral

318.32 --> 325.12
virus model

322.56 --> 326.16
right the idea of it still the idea that

325.12 --> 329.84000000000003
oh it's the

326.16 --> 332.88000000000005
it's spreading the disease is spreading

329.84 --> 334.63899999999995
that idea instead of the condition there

332.88 --> 338.96
might be some weird like

334.639 --> 341.199
uh psychosomatic based

338.96 --> 342.479
things that might be happening that

341.199 --> 344.0
would make it seem

342.479 --> 346.639
like indeed there is some kind of a

344.0 --> 349.12
shedding through

346.639 --> 351.039
through spiritual sympathy right which

349.12 --> 353.12
would be psychosomatics again because

351.039 --> 354.96
there is no infection

353.12 --> 357.68
from people that have might be taking

354.96 --> 360.08
vaccines or whatever

357.68 --> 361.759
and even like the proteins i explained

360.08 --> 365.44
this before

361.759 --> 365.44
so i thought of a little meme

365.759 --> 373.12
feedback loop beware of shatters

369.759 --> 377.44
right but a shatter

373.12 --> 381.6
is also people who live in sheds

377.44 --> 385.28
like owen benjamin because shatters

381.6 --> 386.8
they know how to avoid the narrative

385.28 --> 390.4
belief

386.8 --> 395.039
so it's like beware of shatters

390.4 --> 396.96
could interpret it as okay beware of the

395.039 --> 398.96
virus it's even more dangerous

396.96 --> 401.59999999999997
or if you know to look through it and

398.96 --> 403.919
you probably heard about owen benjamin

401.6 --> 405.6
beware of shatters they don't believe

403.919 --> 409.84
our narrative

405.6 --> 415.12
right it's a little little puzzle

409.84 --> 415.11999999999995
that came to me i love those moments

418.319 --> 423.28000000000003
i might call my hangout this but the

421.12 --> 426.479
problem is is that

423.28 --> 429.599
it might uh yeah because

426.479 --> 432.71999999999997
it is still basically fully a

429.599 --> 435.039
narrative based word or maybe you could

432.72 --> 437.59900000000005
say it like beware of people who live in

435.039 --> 440.15999999999997
sheds

437.599 --> 441.12
but then it wouldn't be apparent the

440.16 --> 442.88000000000005
trick

441.12 --> 444.319
so i'm not sure if i'm gonna call the

442.88 --> 447.84
hangout that

444.319 --> 450.88
but anyway also

447.84 --> 456.0
for those who seek to squirt more over

450.88 --> 456.0
crazy techno paranoia

456.479 --> 461.52
covet vaccine seems to make some people

459.28 --> 464.23999999999995
locally magnetic

461.52 --> 465.75899999999996
so then i thought okay people here here

464.24 --> 468.879
we go

465.759 --> 471.84000000000003
maybe the vaccine turns you into a 5g

468.879 --> 471.84000000000003
relay station

474.08 --> 480.96
this is yeah

478.879 --> 482.879
don't score too much over it don't

480.96 --> 485.919
spread it too far it's probably gonna

482.879 --> 489.44
arrive naturally in other people's minds

485.919 --> 492.87899999999996
it's a bit of a forecast right

489.44 --> 494.96
also the mystery of the popularity of

492.879 --> 497.199
the frogs

494.96 --> 499.35999999999996
why is it why is there so many frogs in

497.199 --> 502.72
conspiracy land right

499.36 --> 506.24
pepe the frog and

502.72 --> 510.24
the gay frog from alex jones

506.24 --> 513.839
well i have a actually a

510.24 --> 517.039
esoteric answer to this

513.839 --> 520.1590000000001
why well it's because the frog

517.039 --> 520.88
really is very much like the canary is

520.159 --> 524.159
in a

520.88 --> 526.8
to a coal miner see

524.159 --> 528.0
canary in a coal mine they're super

526.8 --> 532.64
sensitive to gas

528.0 --> 535.36
to non like to butane

532.64 --> 537.12
to poison in in the air they're very

535.36 --> 539.76
sensitive to it and they like

537.12 --> 540.88
drop that very quickly so that's why

539.76 --> 543.68
coal miners

540.88 --> 545.92
use them so if they accidentally unleash

543.68 --> 547.3599999999999
the pocket of gas which they might not

545.92 --> 549.279
know

547.36 --> 550.8000000000001
if it if it would happen it would just

549.279 --> 552.959
start to seep through

550.8 --> 555.279
then as long as the canary is just doing

552.959 --> 555.279
fine

556.56 --> 560.4799999999999
then they know it's safe but if suddenly

558.959 --> 562.8
the canary is dead it's like

560.48 --> 564.64
run run to the outside as quick as

562.8 --> 566.7199999999999
possible

564.64 --> 569.36
right that's a canary in a coal mine

566.72 --> 572.5600000000001
well a frog

569.36 --> 575.04
a frog is kind of the same thing

572.56 --> 576.7199999999999
to nature especially to the wet regions

575.04 --> 577.76
where they are predominantly like at

576.72 --> 580.88
swamps but

577.76 --> 584.64
riverlands ponds

580.88 --> 587.519
right because frogs they're very loud

584.64 --> 589.1999999999999
right especially when in the mating

587.519 --> 592.08
season in the summer and all that

589.2 --> 593.36
kind of like crickets they're very loud

592.08 --> 596.8000000000001
but

593.36 --> 597.839
it's the sound of a frog is actually a

596.8 --> 599.8389999999999
blessing

597.839 --> 601.36
from nature because frogs are like

599.839 --> 605.12
canaries in the coal mine

601.36 --> 608.16
they respond a lot

605.12 --> 610.32
to poison in the water

608.16 --> 611.1999999999999
like canaries respond to poison in the

610.32 --> 614.399
air

611.2 --> 617.2
frogs respond to poison in the water so

614.399 --> 617.76
if there is some pollution happening

617.2 --> 620.72
then

617.76 --> 622.48
if it's really bad you could notice that

620.72 --> 624.0790000000001
suddenly the frogs have all died right

622.48 --> 626.0790000000001
if that happens that's like a

624.079 --> 627.68
curse that was like a curse in ancient

626.079 --> 630.7199999999999
times like oh my god the frogs died

627.68 --> 633.4399999999999
there's something really bad

630.72 --> 634.8000000000001
some serious poison or something that

633.44 --> 637.2
would scare them

634.8 --> 640.24
probably if they didn't understand the

637.2 --> 640.24
biology really

640.72 --> 649.36
right so frogs are like canaries

646.8 --> 650.3199999999999
there yeah what i said they're like a

649.36 --> 652.16
blessing

650.32 --> 653.44
and they're very sensitive to poison in

652.16 --> 654.8
the water

653.44 --> 656.24
so if there's something wrong with the

654.8 --> 658.8389999999999
frogs then you know there's something

656.24 --> 660.399
wrong with the water you got to be

658.839 --> 663.6800000000001
careful

660.399 --> 667.68
right and this is just esoteric

663.68 --> 668.16
nature based truth and because of that

667.68 --> 670.88
power

668.16 --> 672.16
because of that function with the

670.88 --> 675.36
knowledge

672.16 --> 679.76
it's a great

675.36 --> 683.04
meme arc type mold

679.76 --> 683.04
for resistance

684.079 --> 690.3199999999999
for resistance against poisoning against

687.12 --> 694.64
yeah well yeah that

690.32 --> 698.88
and that's basically what controllers do

694.64 --> 700.8389999999999
rulers evil people like to poison you in

698.88 --> 703.12
all kinds of ways psychologically

700.839 --> 706.5600000000001
mentally

703.12 --> 706.5600000000001
and also with the water

706.8 --> 711.68
and with well some regions maybe even

709.6 --> 713.279
with chemtrails not sure

711.68 --> 715.12
how much of that is actually still

713.279 --> 718.16
happening i know their

715.12 --> 719.279
weather modifying but like the poisons i

718.16 --> 722.3199999999999
don't know for sure

719.279 --> 722.72
i just i have my doubts about it but i

722.32 --> 725.0400000000001
do

722.72 --> 729.36
know that they are geoengineering so

725.04 --> 730.88
that case you could involve the sky

729.36 --> 732.639
and of course some regions there's

730.88 --> 735.2
fluoride in the water right so

732.639 --> 735.2
frogs

736.079 --> 747.04
it's a good symbol and i like frogs

745.279 --> 748.399
yeah if you're gonna like i used to

747.04 --> 751.4399999999999
sleep

748.399 --> 752.24
sometimes in places in nature when i was

751.44 --> 756.1600000000001
a kid i went

752.24 --> 757.76
into nature a lot as a young kid

756.16 --> 761.92
and sometimes if there were a lot of

757.76 --> 764.72
frogs yeah man they can be freaking loud

761.92 --> 764.7199999999999
you would go out

765.04 --> 768.3199999999999
like over at pawns and [ __ ] in the

767.44 --> 769.839
evening

768.32 --> 772.399
and you couldn't barely even have a

769.839 --> 774.1600000000001
conversation with each other like a

772.399 --> 777.2
meter distance because of the frogs

774.16 --> 778.56
being so freaking loud and just

777.2 --> 780.9590000000001
it's like they almost had like this

778.56 --> 782.3199999999999
psychosomatic thing going this web of

780.959 --> 786.16
sound and you just

782.32 --> 789.839
can't get through that

786.16 --> 793.519
not the gay ones yeah that's right

789.839 --> 796.1600000000001
thursday beetroot you don't have to

793.519 --> 796.16
remove that

796.32 --> 801.44
all right so these were some things that

797.92 --> 806.3199999999999
were on my mind

801.44 --> 809.0400000000001
time to put them down hello dutch sailor

806.32 --> 809.519
shatner's bassoon seeking star water

809.04 --> 811.68
nathan

809.519 --> 811.68
r

812.959 --> 815.8389999999999
welcome to the show

827.58 --> 830.779
[Music]

833.43 --> 836.76
[Music]

836.959 --> 857.8389999999999
hey nathan oakley how are you doing

842.399 --> 857.839
still healing up fine i hope

864.88 --> 869.36
okay good servant you think frogs are

866.72 --> 872.32
pretty gay

869.36 --> 872.32
in what sense

874.48 --> 885.839
yes nathan r atrazine definitely does

877.279 --> 885.8389999999999
unnatural things to frogs

890.8 --> 895.519
hmm okay nathan well if if it's still

894.32 --> 899.0400000000001
like in the healing up

895.519 --> 902.16
phase not just the the cleaning up after

899.04 --> 905.279
phase because that's still gonna happen

902.16 --> 909.04
then you might wanna just like flush

905.279 --> 909.04
carefully with colloidal silver

909.36 --> 913.839
that might speed it up a little

914.88 --> 919.199
right if it's still like there's still a

916.959 --> 919.8389999999999
wound and it's literally still trying to

919.199 --> 923.199
recover

919.839 --> 926.639
and heal up and men yeah connect

923.199 --> 928.639
then once that's done

926.639 --> 930.32
then it's really gonna heal up in the

928.639 --> 932.0790000000001
final phase and it might get a little

930.32 --> 941.839
dirty here and there

932.079 --> 941.8389999999999
that's a good sign

946.56 --> 949.8389999999999
right and it might also by the way

948.72 --> 952.5600000000001
depending on your

949.839 --> 953.6800000000001
condition like flushing with colloidal

952.56 --> 956.959
silver it might

953.68 --> 959.7589999999999
also happen help to prevent

956.959 --> 961.68
from that it might spread slightly just

959.759 --> 962.16
part of the inflammation that might

961.68 --> 964.7199999999999
happen

962.16 --> 966.16
right if it's all going to be doused in

964.72 --> 968.9590000000001
it

966.16 --> 970.079
it'll be just better able to withstand

968.959 --> 973.04
that

970.079 --> 973.04
colloidal silver

976.079 --> 978.959
it's awesome stuff

980.24 --> 983.839
if you make it right

1010.16 --> 1017.8389999999999
anyway so yeah pretty much

1014.079 --> 1025.839
open for whatever subject

1017.839 --> 1025.839
you guys gals want to talk about

1050.84 --> 1053.84
so

1063.679 --> 1070.72
a vertical rainbow

1067.039 --> 1070.72
replace your peak wow

1072.72 --> 1076.64
oh you got that uploaded somewhere

1078.799 --> 1081.9189999999999
nice nathan oakley is alex jones sells

1081.36 --> 1084.32
silver

1081.919 --> 1084.3200000000002
could be

1085.039 --> 1088.16
or he even back in the day he used to

1087.6 --> 1090.559
have

1088.16 --> 1095.039
connections with like gold sellers and

1090.559 --> 1099.2
all that

1095.039 --> 1099.2
so he's had that for a long time

1101.919 --> 1106.8400000000001
yeah alex jones sells a lot of things

1104.88 --> 1109.8400000000001
and

1106.84 --> 1112.0
hey

1109.84 --> 1113.84
if you're really like the trade guy you

1112.0 --> 1116.08
might be able to find something cheaper

1113.84 --> 1118.72
but at least everything he sells is

1116.08 --> 1120.1599999999999
is usually good quality like and when

1118.72 --> 1122.96
there's something wrong

1120.16 --> 1125.1200000000001
over time then he alters it to correct

1122.96 --> 1125.1200000000001
it

1127.6 --> 1131.9189999999999
so especially like the products that

1129.36 --> 1133.039
have been like pretty much unchanged for

1131.919 --> 1137.039
a long time

1133.039 --> 1140.0
they're usually just very good

1137.039 --> 1140.0
right anyway

1144.08 --> 1149.12
yeah seeking star water i'm very curious

1147.12 --> 1151.84
to see this picture you got it uploaded

1149.12 --> 1151.84
somewhere

1161.28 --> 1167.12
the enlightenment period and a

1163.2 --> 1167.1200000000001
subversion of the scientific method

1176.84 --> 1181.039
oh

1178.64 --> 1181.039
all right

1181.15 --> 1184.799
[Music]

1182.88 --> 1187.1200000000001
yeah the enlightenment period what a

1184.799 --> 1187.12
time

1187.919 --> 1190.96
i think that during those times there

1190.16 --> 1195.44
was some

1190.96 --> 1195.44
serious brilliance being unlocked

1195.52 --> 1202.0
wildly like people really

1199.2 --> 1204.0
rose up out of the like the long time

1202.0 --> 1205.44
suppression period that has been going

1204.0 --> 1208.159
through

1205.44 --> 1208.159
before that

1212.64 --> 1221.8400000000001
just something happened like some kind

1214.799 --> 1221.84
of energy just arrived the inspiration

1223.28 --> 1229.2
and yeah i think that that's also

1226.24 --> 1229.2
probably where

1229.76 --> 1238.799
probably tertaria really came from

1234.96 --> 1242.4
a lot of ideas and people figuring out

1238.799 --> 1245.6
how to build it and then that knowledge

1242.4 --> 1248.0
spread and you

1245.6 --> 1248.9599999999998
you got like a real serious builders

1248.0 --> 1253.039
that just use

1248.96 --> 1256.159
ancient techniques kind of secretly

1253.039 --> 1258.24
and then they use that to even like

1256.159 --> 1263.8400000000001
overwhelm everybody like wow look at

1258.24 --> 1263.84
what we can do

1264.72 --> 1269.039
and yeah that way you can get pretty big

1267.28 --> 1271.2
because it's almost to most people like

1269.039 --> 1276.8799999999999
whoa the gods have just arrived and

1271.2 --> 1279.1200000000001
like oh it's awesome we're safe now

1276.88 --> 1281.8400000000001
right until the gravelers eventually

1279.12 --> 1281.84
find their way

1282.159 --> 1285.6000000000001
and start to mind control people and

1284.48 --> 1289.2
that's the

1285.6 --> 1292.6399999999999
yeah that really started up

1289.2 --> 1294.64
during the industrialization

1292.64 --> 1296.5590000000002
but before that yeah there was a lot of

1294.64 --> 1299.2800000000002
wizardry going on there were people

1296.559 --> 1302.84
planning and scheming

1299.28 --> 1305.84
mind control schemes cults

1302.84 --> 1305.84
heliocentrism

1306.32 --> 1309.9189999999999
but i think that these people back then

1308.159 --> 1313.0390000000002
were very identified

1309.919 --> 1315.76
like people knew what these wizards

1313.039 --> 1318.1589999999999
whatever sorcerers probably would have

1315.76 --> 1321.6
been seen like that were up to

1318.159 --> 1321.6000000000001
and they didn't really trust them

1327.36 --> 1330.4799999999998
right there's even like historical

1329.039 --> 1334.64
accounts of that

1330.48 --> 1338.24
news or yeah book works

1334.64 --> 1338.24
referencing to them like that

1344.96 --> 1349.679
not yeah shatner's bassoon i don't think

1347.52 --> 1351.2
that the scientific method was corrupted

1349.679 --> 1353.919
that early on

1351.2 --> 1353.919
i think that

1355.12 --> 1362.0
like even the designers were

1358.559 --> 1363.84
yeah it was like it's scary to really

1362.0 --> 1365.679
bypass it because you can't become

1363.84 --> 1366.8799999999999
delusional and they would have been wise

1365.679 --> 1369.76
enough

1366.88 --> 1371.919
not to do that publicly right most

1369.76 --> 1373.679
people didn't

1371.919 --> 1375.76
like they didn't even just understand

1373.679 --> 1377.52
the scientific method at all

1375.76 --> 1379.28
they would think that was already kind

1377.52 --> 1383.679
of wizardry and like

1379.28 --> 1383.6789999999999
yeah but god says this

1384.159 --> 1387.679
right it's not the method that's going

1386.32 --> 1390.1589999999999
to tell me whether it's real

1387.679 --> 1392.159
right like that the people weren't ready

1390.159 --> 1396.5590000000002
yet

1392.159 --> 1396.5590000000002
and then much later i think only really

1397.039 --> 1402.0
during the late 19th century late

1400.84 --> 1404.72
industrialization

1402.0 --> 1405.2
early 20th century that the scientific

1404.72 --> 1407.84
method

1405.2 --> 1409.52
really started to click people started

1407.84 --> 1411.76
to understand

1409.52 --> 1411.76
that

1412.72 --> 1418.48
that it helped improve things too

1416.48 --> 1422.4
so many things had changed at first for

1418.48 --> 1424.24
the worse as it always does but then

1422.4 --> 1425.52
things got kind of solved even like

1424.24 --> 1427.76
pollution issues

1425.52 --> 1429.36
like the the problem of things were

1427.76 --> 1431.12
being figured out through this

1429.36 --> 1435.84
scientific method

1431.12 --> 1438.2399999999998
chemistry biology they all had

1435.84 --> 1440.1589999999999
a lot of revolutions that would yield

1438.24 --> 1441.36
results because of the scientific method

1440.159 --> 1443.2
right

1441.36 --> 1444.9599999999998
and not everybody would understand it

1443.2 --> 1445.76
but they would start to trust it because

1444.96 --> 1449.44
of that

1445.76 --> 1451.6
it's only really i think in the 60s

1449.44 --> 1452.88
that the scientific method really

1451.6 --> 1456.32
started to slip

1452.88 --> 1458.4
and falter in people's minds

1456.32 --> 1459.4399999999998
that there was because it was a cultural

1458.4 --> 1462.48
revolution

1459.44 --> 1466.4
it's like we're free it's liberal

1462.48 --> 1470.4
liberating liberal liberation from

1466.4 --> 1473.76
from foundation from empiricism

1470.4 --> 1475.44
like science can be math that really i

1473.76 --> 1479.279
think came in the 60s

1475.44 --> 1481.679
not really before that maybe einstein

1479.279 --> 1483.52
had a hand in it too but even in his own

1481.679 --> 1484.5590000000002
time he was kind of regarded as a wizard

1483.52 --> 1488.08
because of it

1484.559 --> 1491.039
people were very stuck to

1488.08 --> 1492.3999999999999
the scientific method still right so

1491.039 --> 1501.84
this is my

1492.4 --> 1501.8400000000001
overview on how it was

1503.279 --> 1515.84
i hope it's it makes sense to you i

1505.84 --> 1515.84
think i'm pretty spot on with this

1524.159 --> 1528.159
not actually done then but recognized by

1526.48 --> 1530.32
the intelligence intelligentsia

1528.159 --> 1532.24
now but look it's like the people that

1530.32 --> 1537.039
are making the

1532.24 --> 1537.039
heliocentric myth stories yeah they

1537.2 --> 1542.0800000000002
they avoid it but that didn't mean that

1541.2 --> 1545.52
they wouldn't

1542.08 --> 1548.3999999999999
also dedicate some of their attention to

1545.52 --> 1551.9189999999999
actual physical things in the world

1548.4 --> 1553.48
physical sciences as well

1551.919 --> 1555.919
right so they had to come out

1553.48 --> 1558.4
compartmentalize it there's the cultural

1555.919 --> 1560.48
aspect the heliocentric religion

1558.4 --> 1562.0
and then there's the actual field

1560.48 --> 1564.32
science

1562.0 --> 1566.0
which definitely requires the scientific

1564.32 --> 1568.3999999999999
method if you if you bypass

1566.0 --> 1569.679
it then you're gonna get wrong you're

1568.4 --> 1572.799
gonna just

1569.679 --> 1574.72
yeah rip a mistake it's just wrong

1572.799 --> 1577.9189999999999
that's also they kind of tried that with

1574.72 --> 1580.24
the cavendish experiment

1577.919 --> 1582.96
and yeah that was very quickly just

1580.24 --> 1584.96
figured out to be a wizard trick

1582.96 --> 1588.559
although it's still being like

1584.96 --> 1591.279
culturally applied in schools i guess

1588.559 --> 1593.039
i think really that most of it is just

1591.279 --> 1595.12
culture and it's kind of like

1593.039 --> 1596.32
it's culture pretending to be science

1595.12 --> 1598.559
it's like mimicking

1596.32 --> 1600.08
like we are science but no it's actually

1598.559 --> 1603.6789999999999
a culture

1600.08 --> 1606.48
and people buy into it they don't think

1603.679 --> 1606.48
about it too much

1611.279 --> 1614.88
oh that's okay chad knows bassoon

1619.76 --> 1627.84
emailed me all right let's take a look

1635.039 --> 1643.6
what oh the photo seems a little blurry

1639.76 --> 1643.6
i don't really see

1644.08 --> 1646.559
rainbow

1651.2 --> 1656.88
there is some weird color situation

1653.2 --> 1656.88
going on but that's like the entire

1657.6 --> 1661.12
photograph i i don't see it

1662.96 --> 1669.8400000000001
place here is behind the pink area

1666.84 --> 1669.84
it

1672.559 --> 1676.32
are you sure you sent the right picture

1680.799 --> 1697.84
i mean i'll show it but

1703.44 --> 1709.2
right this this is the picture i got

1707.2 --> 1711.8400000000001
it is a beautiful picture though a

1709.2 --> 1711.8400000000001
little blurry

1715.679 --> 1720.5590000000002
but yeah it must be tough to keep it you

1717.6 --> 1725.84
probably made it with hand

1720.559 --> 1725.84
and not a uh oh the other thing

1737.039 --> 1740.72
with the tripod that's it

1750.84 --> 1753.84
right

1774.96 --> 1795.8400000000001
all right just popped out the chat

1780.559 --> 1795.84
should have done that earlier

1806.84 --> 1810.799
hmm

1808.72 --> 1811.76
okay well seeking star wars could it be

1810.799 --> 1814.6399999999999
that the

1811.76 --> 1816.24
the prismatic effect of the rainbow that

1814.64 --> 1819.8400000000001
it actually

1816.24 --> 1821.039
appeared really close maybe it's just

1819.84 --> 1824.1589999999999
because of your

1821.039 --> 1824.1589999999999
the shape of your eye

1826.08 --> 1829.6789999999999
and that the camera wouldn't really pick

1827.919 --> 1837.44
it up

1829.679 --> 1851.8400000000001
i don't know

1837.44 --> 1851.8400000000001
hey that one guy good morning

1890.84 --> 1893.84
hmm

1897.44 --> 1903.1200000000001
right yeah seeking star wars like

1901.279 --> 1905.44
if you really see something very

1903.12 --> 1906.0
spectacular you should try to just film

1905.44 --> 1909.3600000000001
it not

1906.0 --> 1909.36
not just photograph it

1910.159 --> 1915.279
but if yeah if i don't know if you if

1912.32 --> 1916.799
your device can do that

1915.279 --> 1921.679
if you not have enough memory or

1916.799 --> 1923.679
something or battery

1921.679 --> 1926.64
you seem to be going around in some

1923.679 --> 1929.8400000000001
really beautiful looking country

1926.64 --> 1929.8400000000001
i'd love to have a good look

1933.519 --> 1937.519
hello here we go again good to see you

1938.72 --> 1945.519
ah right seeking stuff so it was kind of

1942.559 --> 1948.0
like that big storm front

1945.519 --> 1948.559
that came over was it like last week or

1948.0 --> 1951.2
the week

1948.559 --> 1951.2
before that

1951.76 --> 1956.32
it was all in a time span of like two or

1954.72 --> 1959.039
three minutes

1956.32 --> 1961.279
but i was just so impressed that i i

1959.039 --> 1962.799
couldn't get myself to step away and to

1961.279 --> 1966.159
record it

1962.799 --> 1968.559
i could have tried but i just felt like

1966.159 --> 1971.7600000000002
no i'm too distracted to do this

1968.559 --> 1977.84
i have to just like

1971.76 --> 1977.84
interface with the moment uh

1982.32 --> 1986.72
cool okay looking forward to that

1988.399 --> 1992.6399999999999
what is your compass pointing at uh

1993.84 --> 2005.84
probably geomagnetic north

2012.159 --> 2021.6000000000001
or if you are south of the equator then

2018.399 --> 2021.6
away from the south

2022.24 --> 2033.84
from the south magnetic pole or poles

2025.76 --> 2033.84
i think there's two of them

2058.839 --> 2061.839
so

2072.0 --> 2089.839
kitty is much better today oh that's

2073.839 --> 2089.839
good to hear

2106.96 --> 2117.839
ah such nice weather

2124.0 --> 2127.2
it's funny like in this weather it's

2125.599 --> 2130.32
very typical

2127.2 --> 2131.2799999999997
eventually like personal airplanes do

2130.32 --> 2134.7200000000003
fly over there

2131.28 --> 2137.8390000000004
are like personal airplane

2134.72 --> 2140.3999999999996
airports or just hobby

2137.839 --> 2140.4
pilots

2141.359 --> 2147.52
good stuff

2144.48 --> 2159.839
would be probably quite a spectacle to

2147.52 --> 2159.839
do that

2161.98 --> 2165.01
[Music]

2166.56 --> 2169.52
a black kitty

2170.64 --> 2175.52
oh yeah black kitties can be dangerous

2173.28 --> 2175.52
though

2177.52 --> 2181.7599999999998
especially in the shadows like they can

2179.839 --> 2183.44
start all the [ __ ] out here i've

2181.76 --> 2187.8390000000004
seen some black cats that were really

2183.44 --> 2187.839
addicted to doing that

2197.44 --> 2201.839
there's two cats over here there is like

2199.599 --> 2201.839
the

2205.44 --> 2211.76
cypre very typical cat

2208.64 --> 2215.359
male he's not a giant but he

2211.76 --> 2218.6400000000003
is like male and he just really likes to

2215.359 --> 2221.2
eat and kind of lazy around

2218.64 --> 2224.3199999999997
but he has like dignity towards other

2221.2 --> 2224.3199999999997
cats as a male

2225.839 --> 2228.88
and then there's the other white one

2227.839 --> 2232.56
who's also

2228.88 --> 2232.56
male but very different characters

2233.68 --> 2242.0789999999997
much slimmer and more like a minx

2238.24 --> 2245.68
like really really super agile

2242.079 --> 2248.2400000000002
even for a cat and he is like

2245.68 --> 2250.72
sometimes even very motiony almost like

2248.24 --> 2250.72
a snake

2251.04 --> 2256.079
he's like he's really awesome and he

2254.0 --> 2258.96
comes by too

2256.079 --> 2259.28
but mostly he's just out in the field

2258.96 --> 2262.32
like

2259.28 --> 2264.48
hunting for moles and mice and just

2262.32 --> 2267.44
screwing around not even hunting it's

2264.48 --> 2267.44
really like playing

2269.359 --> 2285.839
i really like it it's a really cool

2272.32 --> 2285.839
completely white cat

2286.72 --> 2288.9599999999996
whoa

2291.839 --> 2295.68
growls at strangers oui so you got a

2295.28 --> 2299.8390000000004
guard

2295.68 --> 2299.839
cat one of those

2310.839 --> 2313.839
hmm

2315.76 --> 2321.6800000000003
i miss my old cat she used to sleep

2319.04 --> 2321.68
on me too

2324.839 --> 2327.839
hmm

2352.839 --> 2355.839
hmm

2356.72 --> 2361.2
i don't you just love it when cats since

2360.0 --> 2363.92
i'm like a computer

2361.2 --> 2364.72
guy with a keyboard like a lot of cats

2363.92 --> 2366.56
also

2364.72 --> 2370.56
i've noticed through other people like

2366.56 --> 2370.56
to get onto people's keyboards

2373.28 --> 2377.52
like especially like if you're looking

2375.359 --> 2380.0789999999997
at the screen

2377.52 --> 2381.7599999999998
then they're like hi i'm going to stand

2380.079 --> 2397.8390000000004
on

2381.76 --> 2397.8390000000004
a sudden

2410.64 --> 2425.04
whoa andrew dude trying to bring down

2414.4 --> 2430.079
the spirit

2425.04 --> 2430.079
what the fallen angels technology

2436.839 --> 2439.839
what

2443.68 --> 2449.52
in sociology we discussed how freudian

2446.319 --> 2452.88
psychology became pseudoscience religion

2449.52 --> 2455.599
the 40s and 50s oh like

2452.88 --> 2459.52
eugenics so it's basically like because

2455.599 --> 2462.6400000000003
freud was all about freaking eugenics

2459.52 --> 2466.16
it makes sense that there yeah

2462.64 --> 2470.0
the religious revolution in that era

2466.16 --> 2473.359
star trek came kind of also out of that

2470.0 --> 2476.8
it's that futurism right it's that old

2473.359 --> 2481.839
futurism and then

2476.8 --> 2481.8390000000004
like the 60s happened

2486.88 --> 2492.0
yeah they they planned all of the

2489.28 --> 2492.0
transitions

2492.839 --> 2495.839
like

2506.839 --> 2512.199
so

2509.1 --> 2512.199
[Music]

2520.839 --> 2523.839
videos

2535.359 --> 2541.44
what good servant

2539.04 --> 2545.119
now you're saying that an attack cat is

2541.44 --> 2547.44
fallen angel's technology what i

2545.119 --> 2551.839
it's trouble for trying to figure out

2547.44 --> 2551.839
what you're saying

2554.64 --> 2561.359
or is aj who knows maybe he's at church

2558.0 --> 2561.359
or something i don't know does he go to

2562.839 --> 2565.839
church

2586.88 --> 2593.839
wow how the time flies

2615.15 --> 2618.219
[Music]

2620.24 --> 2625.1189999999997
right it's really weird now that these

2623.76 --> 2627.6800000000003
pieces of information have been put

2625.119 --> 2632.6400000000003
together also with what you said

2627.68 --> 2632.64
earlier shatner's bassoon

2633.2 --> 2636.64
freudian psychology

2636.96 --> 2639.2
like

2640.72 --> 2645.9199999999996
maybe it was really them like those

2643.839 --> 2649.839
thinkers those

2645.92 --> 2652.64
futurists and eugenicists

2649.839 --> 2652.64
that really

2652.96 --> 2660.079
were gonna implant and they did

2656.319 --> 2663.839
the idea of heliocentrism to be absolute

2660.079 --> 2663.8390000000004
absolutely real

2666.0 --> 2670.319
and then have that reinforced with the

2668.16 --> 2677.839
moon landing it became like a

2670.319 --> 2677.839
military project with the u.s

2686.079 --> 2689.599
elon musk is annoying the crypto space

2688.64 --> 2705.839
again

2689.599 --> 2705.839
what did he do now

2714.94 --> 2718.38
[Music]

2748.0 --> 2753.76
okie dokie wear a mask over your eyes

2758.839 --> 2761.839
uh

2767.76 --> 2771.8390000000004
backing another meme coin oh there

2772.839 --> 2775.839
really

2802.8 --> 2809.04
and he's being blamed for yeah

2806.0 --> 2811.28
well he's maybe it reminds me a lot of

2809.04 --> 2811.2799999999997
like

2814.839 --> 2819.44
trump

2816.96 --> 2820.7200000000003
like he's in a position but there's a

2819.44 --> 2822.7200000000003
lot of people that are probably

2820.72 --> 2825.04
dissatisfied with what he's actually

2822.72 --> 2825.04
doing

2827.68 --> 2833.359
so then when something stupid happens

2830.96 --> 2834.88
especially that time when he was like

2833.359 --> 2836.64
demonstrating that car

2834.88 --> 2839.44
and then he rammed right through the

2836.64 --> 2845.839
window with the single hit

2839.44 --> 2845.839
like nobody was happy about that

2856.96 --> 2862.7200000000003
covet denier okay well victor croot

2866.88 --> 2871.119
what what is it can you tell me that

2870.319 --> 2875.599
victor croot

2871.119 --> 2877.359
what is kofi in order to deny it

2875.599 --> 2879.839
what is seeking star wars actually

2877.359 --> 2879.839
denying

2880.72 --> 2887.839
hey agent

2889.09 --> 2892.2290000000003
[Music]

2898.839 --> 2901.839
so

2907.92 --> 2912.48
the rebranding of any respiratory

2910.079 --> 2915.8390000000004
illness

2912.48 --> 2915.839
roughly yeah

2916.0 --> 2921.76
that's basically what is happening

2919.04 --> 2923.68
if it's effectively what is happening

2921.76 --> 2929.8390000000004
right

2923.68 --> 2929.839
but that wasn't the question though

2932.16 --> 2937.92
disease caused by a virus really

2938.8 --> 2943.119
what's your scientific evidence for that

2940.8 --> 2946.1600000000003
victor croot

2943.119 --> 2948.48
who is going to have to say my name

2946.16 --> 2949.2799999999997
within the sec in the next two minutes

2948.48 --> 2953.52
or

2949.28 --> 2953.52
he might simply be a chat stalker

2954.319 --> 2957.839
victor croot say my name

2972.559 --> 2977.28
oh i don't think victor groot is

2976.64 --> 2980.48
actually

2977.28 --> 2983.0400000000004
listening to the show

2980.48 --> 2985.839
yeah well you know what the penalty for

2983.04 --> 2985.839
that is

2997.44 --> 3005.599
ah right okay 10 seconds

3001.68 --> 3008.8799999999997
10 seconds to say my name victor crude

3005.599 --> 3012.559
nine eight seven

3008.88 --> 3016.88
six five four

3012.559 --> 3027.8390000000004
three two one

3016.88 --> 3027.839
and there you go

3037.96 --> 3041.09
[Applause]

3060.64 --> 3065.359
common question c19 is the common cold

3067.52 --> 3071.04
i wouldn't exactly call it the common

3069.92 --> 3073.28
cold right

3071.04 --> 3074.5589999999997
but common cold is kind of like in the

3073.28 --> 3078.079
same spectrum

3074.559 --> 3078.079
as the covet condition

3078.72 --> 3084.8799999999997
the flu common cold

3082.079 --> 3087.04
there's different types of like symptoms

3084.88 --> 3089.52
typically correlating with it

3087.04 --> 3092.96
so covet is the condition that typically

3089.52 --> 3095.92
associates with respiratory

3092.96 --> 3098.0
the bronchi bronchitis and lungs and

3095.92 --> 3101.44
throat

3098.0 --> 3105.76
that's typic that's the covet condition

3101.44 --> 3105.76
right it's not actually an infection

3106.0 --> 3110.64
or it's not the yeah the infection is

3109.359 --> 3113.44
secondary

3110.64 --> 3115.04
to the any infection may be secondary to

3113.44 --> 3118.96
the condition

3115.04 --> 3122.4
it's not caused by

3118.96 --> 3125.44
some inanimate particle

3122.4 --> 3128.4
floating around hitting you

3125.44 --> 3129.44
or getting into your digestion system or

3128.4 --> 3133.44
something you breathe

3129.44 --> 3136.16
in and then suddenly it starts digesting

3133.44 --> 3138.0
locally and then give you the disease

3136.16 --> 3140.7999999999997
that's not how it works it doesn't work

3138.0 --> 3142.0
like that as it would with some

3140.8 --> 3145.2000000000003
bacterial

3142.0 --> 3148.24
things bacterial pneumonia

3145.2 --> 3150.7999999999997
for example right that is real

3148.24 --> 3153.839
like the ones caused by wearing masks

3150.8 --> 3153.8390000000004
too much

3165.68 --> 3170.5589999999997
what if victor was deaf well

3171.76 --> 3175.599
i'm sorry that

3178.64 --> 3184.0789999999997
i didn't i haven't thought of that

3180.72 --> 3184.0789999999997
actually steamy traveler

3193.52 --> 3198.079
but still he seemed kind of like

3195.76 --> 3200.3190000000004
gamma-ish

3198.079 --> 3200.319
all right

3201.92 --> 3205.839
i don't know this yeah

3206.48 --> 3210.0
i hadn't thought of that before steamy

3208.24 --> 3212.24
traveler is

3210.0 --> 3213.2
right i don't mean to ban just because

3212.24 --> 3215.9199999999996
you're deaf

3213.2 --> 3217.2799999999997
you didn't yeah but it is like i am

3215.92 --> 3219.839
addressing the chat

3217.28 --> 3219.8390000000004
verbally

3221.28 --> 3226.6400000000003
so it's kind of like i'm sorry but i

3224.319 --> 3228.64
don't really can't really provide for

3226.64 --> 3230.16
deaf people here i don't mean to

3228.64 --> 3234.72
discriminate

3230.16 --> 3237.839
it's just that's how this show works

3234.72 --> 3238.7999999999997
and i communicate a lot through the

3237.839 --> 3241.2
verbal element

3238.8 --> 3243.76
and i'm sorry if deaf people are missing

3241.2 --> 3251.839
out on that i really don't mean it

3243.76 --> 3251.8390000000004
on purpose

3254.4 --> 3260.2400000000002
anyway this is like unless

3257.44 --> 3262.2400000000002
yeah but if you're deaf that doesn't

3260.24 --> 3265.04
give you an excuse to be a dick or an

3262.24 --> 3269.04
ignorant idiot though

3265.04 --> 3271.44
right i'm not gonna discriminate

3269.04 --> 3278.16
against you just because you're deaf if

3271.44 --> 3282.2400000000002
you're also a dick

3278.16 --> 3282.24
people can lip read all right

3283.92 --> 3288.88
he ain't deaf yeah no but it was just

3286.079 --> 3292.0
hypothetical

3288.88 --> 3296.2400000000002
anyway covet

3292.0 --> 3298.799
condition right so these exosomes

3296.24 --> 3301.359
which are identified as viruses the

3298.799 --> 3303.68
correlating factor

3301.359 --> 3307.839
yeah the thing about them is you have

3303.68 --> 3310.0789999999997
them in your body all the time

3307.839 --> 3311.839
there's like literally the tests that

3310.079 --> 3313.92
are supposedly going to tell you whether

3311.839 --> 3317.04
you have covet or not

3313.92 --> 3320.48
it's actually a test for the condition

3317.04 --> 3323.92
it tests those particles

3320.48 --> 3327.92
the amount in a certain location

3323.92 --> 3332.0
to figure out the average

3327.92 --> 3334.64
like the literally a percentage of that

3332.0 --> 3336.559
within your system and then when you

3334.64 --> 3337.359
have a certain threshold that's when

3336.559 --> 3340.559
they say okay

3337.359 --> 3344.0
you have it right

3340.559 --> 3346.4
overlooking the actual

3344.0 --> 3348.16
yeah it's like viruses right it's

3346.4 --> 3352.4
supposed to be infection so you

3348.16 --> 3356.5589999999997
always have a percentage of it

3352.4 --> 3359.04
always how is that

3356.559 --> 3360.3190000000004
how does that work out with the idea of

3359.04 --> 3363.68
infection

3360.319 --> 3365.599
that makes no sense right it's not the

3363.68 --> 3368.0
same thing

3365.599 --> 3370.6400000000003
either you have it or you don't if you

3368.0 --> 3374.559
always have some of it then

3370.64 --> 3374.5589999999997
how is that an infection it's it's a

3374.839 --> 3377.839
condition

3382.48 --> 3389.44
pcr tests are both well no agm

3386.0 --> 3390.559
technically they are tests it's just

3389.44 --> 3394.319
that

3390.559 --> 3398.96
for the model of viral covet infection

3394.319 --> 3400.72
it's useless it's not because the test

3398.96 --> 3403.68
right well there have been problems

3400.72 --> 3405.839
where it's just like wildly off

3403.68 --> 3408.5589999999997
and all that right i think there might

3405.839 --> 3410.72
have been some improvement since then

3408.559 --> 3412.48
but what it basically did is just take a

3410.72 --> 3414.9599999999996
sample and then figure out

3412.48 --> 3416.64
how many of these specific particles are

3414.96 --> 3418.64
in there

3416.64 --> 3421.2799999999997
but like the preliminary tests were kind

3418.64 --> 3421.2799999999997
of useless

3422.48 --> 3427.359
so to actually test it it was a lot more

3424.72 --> 3430.5589999999997
complicated

3427.359 --> 3431.359
and what it comes down to for the real

3430.559 --> 3434.4
testing

3431.359 --> 3438.48
is making out a percentage of these

3434.4 --> 3440.319
exosomes in the sample

3438.48 --> 3442.4
and then cross-referencing it with a

3440.319 --> 3446.0
diagram that says okay if it's this

3442.4 --> 3449.839
many over that then they

3446.0 --> 3454.24
are infected that's how the the real

3449.839 --> 3454.24
real testing system works

3454.72 --> 3458.64
so that means they are it's normal to

3458.0 --> 3460.799
have them

3458.64 --> 3463.7599999999998
to actually have those particles in your

3460.799 --> 3466.079
system at all time

3463.76 --> 3466.079
okay

3467.76 --> 3474.0
so yeah the virus infection model

3471.119 --> 3476.2400000000002
doesn't hold up at all in the face of

3474.0 --> 3476.24
this

3486.839 --> 3489.839
data

3498.48 --> 3502.2400000000002
right so i hope that addresses a few

3501.839 --> 3504.96
things

3502.24 --> 3504.9599999999996
including to

3506.24 --> 3512.9599999999996
victor croot was banned for

3509.28 --> 3517.8390000000004
not following chat protocol

3512.96 --> 3517.839
of this show

3525.76 --> 3528.96
oh you got a new video

3529.44 --> 3531.839
okay

3566.16 --> 3569.359
uh i don't see it

3569.599 --> 3574.4
last video you uploaded was four months

3572.079 --> 3574.4
ago

3575.839 --> 3587.839
wow you got 1.18k

3580.079 --> 3587.8390000000004
subs nice dude that made a big jump

3592.4 --> 3601.839
yeah good servants channel guys

3609.76 --> 3615.8390000000004
what protocol denier what

3627.17 --> 3630.32
[Music]

3640.839 --> 3643.839
um

3654.839 --> 3657.839
so

3676.64 --> 3680.319
but okay but i don't understand it

3679.92 --> 3685.839
though

3680.319 --> 3685.839
protocol denier

3694.96 --> 3699.839
which protocol exactly

3722.319 --> 3728.64
massive panic attack wow well i hope not

3725.76 --> 3730.88
andrew that's a little dramatic

3728.64 --> 3732.4
i don't know to some people it might be

3730.88 --> 3736.559
pretty

3732.4 --> 3738.319
heavy impact especially if they had

3736.559 --> 3755.8390000000004
really dedicated

3738.319 --> 3755.839
their energy to being part of it

3759.599 --> 3763.76
i don't really get panic attacks from it

3761.44 --> 3767.2000000000003
like i've really

3763.76 --> 3770.0
settled it's like yeah the world is this

3767.2 --> 3772.16
way because it insists

3770.0 --> 3773.839
it's nothing i can really do to change

3772.16 --> 3777.7599999999998
it

3773.839 --> 3780.88
but i can help those who do

3777.76 --> 3783.8390000000004
want to change towards the better the

3780.88 --> 3783.839
better

3795.839 --> 3801.52
oh really oh reason he bent okay

3799.76 --> 3803.76
okay now i get it seeking stillwater

3801.52 --> 3806.079
yeah the chat protocol denier

3803.76 --> 3806.079
okay

3807.44 --> 3810.799
sounds a little weird when you as a

3810.079 --> 3813.92
regular

3810.799 --> 3818.4
chat visitor and part of the show really

3813.92 --> 3818.4
say that though from their perspective

3821.2 --> 3825.839
but i get it it's a joke

3826.23 --> 3829.3
[Music]

3839.2 --> 3853.839
how biblical skill bad things are too

3842.319 --> 3853.839
well here we go again

3855.839 --> 3859.92
i just got the feeling that a lot of

3858.24 --> 3863.2
what we're being confronted it

3859.92 --> 3866.2400000000002
with is also kind of like it just

3863.2 --> 3867.4399999999996
piles extra on top of it right bad

3866.24 --> 3871.1189999999997
things

3867.44 --> 3874.4
there's a lot of bluff a suggestion that

3871.119 --> 3876.319
the dark side uses and people that want

3874.4 --> 3881.119
attention just get drawn into

3876.319 --> 3882.96
also conjuring it that kind of blurs the

3881.119 --> 3885.599
line as to what is really

3882.96 --> 3886.7200000000003
out there because of all the things that

3885.599 --> 3890.7200000000003
people made up

3886.72 --> 3890.72
on top of what is really out there

3891.839 --> 3895.52
so it's really tough but when i realized

3895.119 --> 3898.96
that

3895.52 --> 3901.92
then then it just does

3898.96 --> 3903.76
like although yeah if you let the full

3901.92 --> 3905.839
scope of the nightmare

3903.76 --> 3907.2000000000003
combined nightmare of everything that

3905.839 --> 3909.52
everybody conjured up

3907.2 --> 3910.72
if you let that hit you yeah it's it's

3909.52 --> 3915.0389999999998
like pure hell

3910.72 --> 3917.839
don't do that right just don't do that

3915.039 --> 3917.8390000000004
don't go there

3920.4 --> 3926.4
a lot of it has only transpired in

3923.2 --> 3926.3999999999996
people's imagination

3928.559 --> 3933.76
doesn't mean that all of it is

3930.16 --> 3933.7599999999998
completely imaginary

3933.839 --> 3937.52
but i just see it as a percentile wise

3936.079 --> 3941.6800000000003
like people like to

3937.52 --> 3945.0
oh put something on top of a story

3941.68 --> 3946.48
to make it extra juicy or scary or

3945.0 --> 3949.599
attention-grabby

3946.48 --> 3952.96
right but certain kind of typical tricks

3949.599 --> 3954.559
then spread around they meme it's like

3952.96 --> 3958.0
tricks that oh that that's

3954.559 --> 3961.119
exciting i'll i might go with that

3958.0 --> 3962.079
narrative right but that way yeah things

3961.119 --> 3966.4
get a little over

3962.079 --> 3966.4
exciting and over dramatic

3967.68 --> 3972.24
and if you believe all of that to the

3969.92 --> 3973.92
fullest extent of your imagination yeah

3972.24 --> 3975.9199999999996
that's gonna drive you nuts that's

3973.92 --> 3977.599
super depressing that's literal

3975.92 --> 3979.599
hellscape that's like

3977.599 --> 3981.52
imagination of that is like oh there's

3979.599 --> 3984.799
actually a giant hell out there is in

3981.52 --> 3987.44
its carnage in this constant

3984.799 --> 3988.0
slaughter of the innocent like really

3987.44 --> 3991.119
heavy

3988.0 --> 3991.44
and it's much worse than we know and and

3991.119 --> 3993.6800000000003
then

3991.44 --> 3996.0
and this is all just like a projected

3993.68 --> 3997.9199999999996
illusion from a matrix

3996.0 --> 3999.039
to make us believe it's all fine and

3997.92 --> 4001.52
that that is all an

3999.039 --> 4001.5200000000004
illusion

4002.799 --> 4006.079
right and then you get really twisted up

4005.28 --> 4008.799
in that

4006.079 --> 4010.96
dichotomy like what is real which one is

4008.799 --> 4020.319
real it drives you nuts

4010.96 --> 4022.799
i i got i was there it drove me nuts

4020.319 --> 4023.359
gotta realize that a lot of it is just

4022.799 --> 4026.48
told

4023.359 --> 4030.0789999999997
very convincingly and it it's like

4026.48 --> 4033.68
in a way that it could be true

4030.079 --> 4036.2400000000002
but it's probably still made up

4033.68 --> 4038.24
right they really think a lot some of

4036.24 --> 4040.64
those people that like to do that they

4038.24 --> 4041.359
really think about it like could this be

4040.64 --> 4044.4
real hey

4041.359 --> 4045.359
in a way i do that i'm just very careful

4044.4 --> 4047.76
with it

4045.359 --> 4049.5989999999997
right i do it with my cosmogeny trying

4047.76 --> 4051.119
to figure out like what could the realm

4049.599 --> 4055.3590000000004
be

4051.119 --> 4055.359
i use those same tricks

4060.24 --> 4067.359
but i make sure that people

4063.68 --> 4070.0
realize like this is a

4067.359 --> 4072.48
mind experiment when i do such things

4070.0 --> 4077.839
this is a presupposition

4072.48 --> 4077.839
what if

4080.24 --> 4087.1189999999997
i was a slave to aj and ike back then

4083.68 --> 4089.9199999999996
well me too in a way

4087.119 --> 4093.599
but not really a slave but i was

4089.92 --> 4093.599
definitely like spellbound like

4094.079 --> 4098.719
he did pile on quite a few nightmares

4100.08 --> 4105.359
at times i would get physically ill from

4102.839 --> 4107.359
it

4105.359 --> 4109.120000000001
but it's it's almost been kind of like

4107.359 --> 4112.319
an inoculation

4109.12 --> 4112.3189999999995
a spiritual one

4112.4 --> 4115.92
and i needed to break out of this

4114.799 --> 4119.359
tenacious

4115.92 --> 4123.12
holes of like no i'm going to just

4119.359 --> 4133.839
pretend like it's fine like i can work

4123.12 --> 4133.839
with this no you can't work with that

4137.12 --> 4142.719
oh you deleted it from youtube

4140.4 --> 4142.719
okay

4145.12 --> 4147.839
oops

4148.159 --> 4161.839
i'll re-upload it then

4165.759 --> 4172.719
2008 man yeah i was

4169.679 --> 4175.1990000000005
right there over at

4172.719 --> 4177.44
alex jones for a while like even before

4175.199 --> 4177.44
that

4177.52 --> 4182.080000000001
but like i went through the whole obama

4179.44 --> 4182.08
deception

4183.679 --> 4189.6
man did he ever call that one like when

4187.12 --> 4191.92
he brought out this movie like

4189.6 --> 4193.759
predicting roughly what he was going to

4191.92 --> 4196.2390000000005
do

4193.759 --> 4203.04
and in so many ways he just hit the nail

4196.239 --> 4205.36
on the head it was insane

4203.04 --> 4205.36
and

4206.64 --> 4211.92
yeah i i i did a lot of like uh

4209.679 --> 4214.64
alex jones activism back then like

4211.92 --> 4218.4
literally spreading articles

4214.64 --> 4221.280000000001
would have my own little forum

4218.4 --> 4222.5599999999995
some niche corner of the internet to

4221.28 --> 4225.92
draw in people

4222.56 --> 4228.4800000000005
like hey you what you need to know this

4225.92 --> 4230.719
like oh look poison in the food and

4228.48 --> 4232.959999999999
water and how that works and

4230.719 --> 4234.64
interesting medical developments and

4232.96 --> 4238.2390000000005
right all that is kind of like

4234.64 --> 4240.88
standard now in many areas

4238.239 --> 4243.28
there's a lot of it and a lot of like

4240.88 --> 4247.12
total misinformation garbage as well

4243.28 --> 4248.8
in other areas but back then it was

4247.12 --> 4251.679
really exciting to do that

4248.8 --> 4253.76
to spread the articles because there

4251.679 --> 4255.36
weren't that many good ones

4253.76 --> 4259.84
there wasn't really much of an

4255.36 --> 4259.839999999999
alternative media yet

4288.159 --> 4291.839999999999
it's a shame what happened to aj

4292.08 --> 4295.04
is it so bad

4299.04 --> 4304.56
i mean he's screwed up a couple of times

4306.719 --> 4312.4800000000005
yes he has a percentage of collab

4310.159 --> 4314.48
grabbler activities at times he has his

4312.48 --> 4316.879999999999
grabbler moments but

4314.48 --> 4319.44
i don't really think he sucks that

4316.88 --> 4319.4400000000005
terribly

4322.88 --> 4326.64
i do really think that he's very

4325.28 --> 4329.84
seriously trying to keep

4326.64 --> 4333.12
improving himself at least

4329.84 --> 4333.12
takes it very serious

4336.159 --> 4343.839999999999
all ego

4355.12 --> 4364.719
i i guess but i don't know

4358.719 --> 4364.719
it i don't find it that unbearable

4365.199 --> 4369.5199999999995
i mean sometimes it's really annoying

4367.6 --> 4370.0
like when he tries to get too much out

4369.52 --> 4373.1990000000005
of it

4370.0 --> 4376.88
out of his credit but the guy does

4373.199 --> 4379.36
have like he has done [ __ ]

4376.88 --> 4382.719
and he did call things right so he

4379.36 --> 4382.719
deserves some credit

4382.84 --> 4385.84
some

4395.92 --> 4401.28
who is ike david ike don't you know

4398.64 --> 4401.280000000001
david ike

4410.88 --> 4427.84
one of the monty pythons what

4429.76 --> 4436.88
okay here we go i actually had like

4433.28 --> 4436.88
conversations with david ike

4437.199 --> 4441.919999999999
i met him too like on certain types of

4439.6 --> 4444.8
fairs in the netherlands

4441.92 --> 4446.0
like alternative fares like alternative

4444.8 --> 4450.88
technology and like

4446.0 --> 4453.04
water energy and pyramid [ __ ] and

4450.88 --> 4455.04
like real conspiracy like mini

4453.04 --> 4455.5199999999995
conspiracy fairs there were a lot of

4455.04 --> 4458.64
them

4455.52 --> 4460.88
around that back then

4458.64 --> 4461.679
and i did meet david ike like face to

4460.88 --> 4469.84
face

4461.679 --> 4469.84
had conversations with him

4490.48 --> 4496.159
i think i'm not sure

4493.679 --> 4497.4400000000005
i think i actually asked dave and ike if

4496.159 --> 4499.92
the earth was flat

4497.44 --> 4499.919999999999
one time

4501.84 --> 4504.96
and he just quickly

4505.76 --> 4509.679
put that to like he basically

4508.0 --> 4512.08
communicated like yeah i don't really

4509.679 --> 4514.08
want to talk about that

4512.08 --> 4515.5199999999995
if i remember correctly i might be

4514.08 --> 4519.28
incorrect and it

4515.52 --> 4519.280000000001
so much has happened since then

4520.96 --> 4527.199
who is bilderberg wow you don't even

4524.159 --> 4531.679
know what bilderberg is stevie travert

4527.199 --> 4535.04
dude bilderberg is like one of the big

4531.679 --> 4537.76
think tank groups

4535.04 --> 4539.76
that have been planning the whole new

4537.76 --> 4543.04
world order stuff

4539.76 --> 4544.4800000000005
for a long time some mega corporations

4543.04 --> 4547.12
and nobility

4544.48 --> 4547.12
and media

4548.719 --> 4553.84
happen at the bilderberg group but also

4550.96 --> 4556.8
other places trilateral commission

4553.84 --> 4557.360000000001
council foreign relations those are like

4556.8 --> 4560.4800000000005
the

4557.36 --> 4562.159
the elitist think tanks and alex jones

4560.48 --> 4567.599999999999
was totally exposing them at the

4562.159 --> 4570.08
beginning of the century

4567.6 --> 4574.159000000001
like end game the movie end game i i

4570.08 --> 4575.84
have the video or the dvd somewhere

4574.159 --> 4577.92
it was all about that the buildable

4575.84 --> 4579.6
group he literally went to the

4577.92 --> 4581.84
bilderberg group there

4579.6 --> 4583.04
as as they were doing they still do it

4581.84 --> 4584.400000000001
too

4583.04 --> 4586.0
they still try to do it when there's

4584.4 --> 4595.44
bilderberg conferences because they

4586.0 --> 4597.28
still happen

4595.44 --> 4598.719
that's yeah that really surprises me

4597.28 --> 4609.84
that you've never heard of that

4598.719 --> 4609.84
before steven traveler

4634.84 --> 4637.84
hmm

4646.0 --> 4650.56
well i've already gone almost half an

4649.52 --> 4654.64
hour

4650.56 --> 4654.64
extra yeah but i feel good today

4656.64 --> 4665.84
i am going to take too many break

4658.239 --> 4665.839999999999
however be right back

4718.84 --> 4721.84
now

4746.84 --> 4749.84
um

4757.12 --> 4763.84
and i'm back

4767.36 --> 4777.839999999999
nuclear agenda hmm

4779.13 --> 4783.4400000000005
[Music]

4780.32 --> 4786.159
yes steamy traveler indeed after a hotel

4783.44 --> 4789.36
in the netherlands that's right

4786.159 --> 4804.4
and started up by prince bernhard

4789.36 --> 4807.478999999999
late prince bernard

4804.4 --> 4807.478999999999
[Music]

4826.96 --> 4830.159
welcome to the show

4831.04 --> 4836.32
well welcome to you to the show this is

4833.76 --> 4836.320000000001
my show

4836.719 --> 4847.84
running is medicinal yeah

4876.639 --> 4880.4800000000005
right yes here we go again and it's

4878.239 --> 4884.0
really crazy

4880.48 --> 4886.638999999999
that it happens because

4884.0 --> 4887.44
they're lit that's like conspiracy

4886.639 --> 4891.28
happening

4887.44 --> 4895.28
like it's illegal what they do

4891.28 --> 4897.679
because they have official government

4895.28 --> 4897.679
heads

4897.84 --> 4901.84
people in governments active governments

4900.639 --> 4904.96
not just

4901.84 --> 4909.6
active governments going there and

4904.96 --> 4912.08
secretly basically being instructed

4909.6 --> 4914.719
or instructing the others right that's

4912.08 --> 4916.96
that's like a secret conspiracy like

4914.719 --> 4918.88
heads of state and people in active

4916.96 --> 4919.6
governments are not allowed to do that

4918.88 --> 4922.0
in secret

4919.6 --> 4924.159000000001
there's laws against it yet they just do

4922.0 --> 4924.159
it

4925.44 --> 4931.12
they have been doing that for a while

4927.36 --> 4933.44
it's pretty bizarre

4931.12 --> 4934.239
it's like they having their own secret

4933.44 --> 4937.04
rules

4934.239 --> 4937.44
just like yeah i know that's your rule

4937.04 --> 4945.1
but

4937.44 --> 4948.469
we don't care we're in power

4945.1 --> 4948.469
[Music]

5000.239 --> 5006.5599999999995
is it similar to g7 well

5003.52 --> 5009.360000000001
i think that g7 is basically just a

5006.56 --> 5009.360000000001
public event

5011.28 --> 5014.88
right it's more like a public forum

5014.239 --> 5017.839999999999
there is

5014.88 --> 5019.28
cameras rolling like like a public

5017.84 --> 5022.639
conference

5019.28 --> 5029.04
so it's different it's not just

5022.639 --> 5030.88
elitist table talking

5029.04 --> 5034.719
i might be wrong though i don't know i

5030.88 --> 5034.719
haven't really deeply looked into it

5034.88 --> 5039.28
into the the whole g setup

5039.76 --> 5043.12
but from just i don't know new snippets

5042.4 --> 5046.879999999999
there's like

5043.12 --> 5046.88
footage of in the middle of it

5047.36 --> 5051.28
so it seems more like a conference thing

5049.679 --> 5055.52
a public thing

5051.28 --> 5057.84
am i right or am i wrong please

5055.52 --> 5057.84
tell me

5103.92 --> 5107.04
right here we go again

5108.639 --> 5114.400000000001
the the g conferences are not secretive

5112.56 --> 5115.6
right that's what i thought right so i

5114.4 --> 5127.839999999999
was correct okay

5115.6 --> 5127.84
thank you for confirming that

5128.88 --> 5132.719
it's more of a

5130.15 --> 5136.4
[Music]

5132.719 --> 5139.679
diplomatic event in ways

5136.4 --> 5141.12
than the other ones because the other

5139.679 --> 5144.2390000000005
ones are just kind of like

5141.12 --> 5147.28
well more like a trade industrial deals

5144.239 --> 5151.04
uh conspiracies like planning

5147.28 --> 5151.04
it's a completely different thing

5152.719 --> 5156.4800000000005
because they can just all keep it a

5162.48 --> 5165.61
[Music]

5166.84 --> 5169.84
secret

5180.0 --> 5183.199
all right i'm not saying that like the

5181.44 --> 5186.159
whole the g meetings

5183.199 --> 5186.159
that it's good

5186.8 --> 5191.84
but if at least they're gonna be public

5189.04 --> 5191.84
about it that's

5192.4 --> 5211.839999999999
the lesser of evils i don't know what to

5196.0 --> 5211.84
call it

5247.679 --> 5255.12
i was thinking keep everything yeah well

5252.0 --> 5258.639
steamy traveler it's like in

5255.12 --> 5259.76
in the end game the movie from alex

5258.639 --> 5262.4800000000005
jones

5259.76 --> 5262.96
with like the un building with the skull

5262.48 --> 5267.44
on it

5262.96 --> 5270.88
all green in that movie

5267.44 --> 5273.919999999999
there's a video clip where it's actually

5270.88 --> 5276.2390000000005
like i think was it even like

5273.92 --> 5277.84
verbally recorded or written down

5276.239 --> 5279.12
somewhere i think it was verbally

5277.84 --> 5282.159000000001
recorded

5279.12 --> 5285.12
somebody was thanking the press

5282.159 --> 5287.759999999999
for keeping it so for ensuring that it

5285.12 --> 5287.76
wouldn't be

5287.84 --> 5292.08
publicly known that like they were

5289.76 --> 5294.08
literally just saying like

5292.08 --> 5296.48
yeah thanks to the press for keeping

5294.08 --> 5299.04
this for a secret for as long as it has

5296.48 --> 5302.08
been a secret

5299.04 --> 5303.92
hahahaha right

5302.08 --> 5306.8
yeah check out that movie if you've

5303.92 --> 5311.04
never seen endgame before yeah it is

5306.8 --> 5313.76
it is really heavy doom in a way though

5311.04 --> 5315.92
like there's a lot of alex jones serious

5313.76 --> 5319.84
doom in there

5315.92 --> 5319.84
don't be fooled too much

5319.92 --> 5325.84
but look carefully because there it it's

5322.88 --> 5325.84
very revealing

5328.48 --> 5337.839999999999
just remember everything you learned

5330.4 --> 5337.839999999999
when you watch it

5342.08 --> 5351.84
let's see if i can find that video

5370.96 --> 5379.84
must be somewhere

5387.6 --> 5391.120000000001
it could be in a box somewhere

5391.28 --> 5407.84
but i do have a lot of dvds

5412.48 --> 5415.199
is it here

5415.6 --> 5423.6
yeah what's here after aha

5420.239 --> 5423.599999999999
oh this is kind of weird though

5424.719 --> 5428.88
of course i still have it plastic

5426.48 --> 5428.879999999999
wrapped

5430.88 --> 5435.52
also that i almost forgot about that

5432.96 --> 5435.52
yeah i got it

5435.92 --> 5442.0
i guess i still have most of the plastic

5438.48 --> 5442.0
wrap i'm hilarious for that

5446.0 --> 5450.88
because i just had the video version so

5448.56 --> 5462.400000000001
i i kind of left the plastic on

5450.88 --> 5464.2390000000005
but yeah ends game that's the one also

5462.4 --> 5467.679
yeah

5464.239 --> 5470.48
it was a good movie at the time

5467.679 --> 5473.12
invisible empire very interesting from

5470.48 --> 5475.678999999999
jason burmes

5473.12 --> 5476.88
was with the infowars team at at the

5475.679 --> 5480.719
time

5476.88 --> 5480.719
and of course the obama deception

5481.04 --> 5485.36
man what an impact that movie made

5486.56 --> 5492.84
i was literally making copies of these

5489.679 --> 5494.159
and handing them out around 2 between

5492.84 --> 5497.76
2008

5494.159 --> 5497.759999999999
2008 2010

5498.88 --> 5502.88
oh yeah nobody my deception too with the

5500.8 --> 5504.96
fall of the republic

5502.88 --> 5507.36
don't i don't remember too much about

5504.96 --> 5507.36
this one

5507.76 --> 5513.4400000000005
but this like obama deception was real

5510.4 --> 5515.92
and the invisible empire

5513.44 --> 5515.919999999999
that's when

5516.88 --> 5523.76
like alex jones really upped his

5520.32 --> 5526.0
his editor crew the production

5523.76 --> 5527.52
quality of these movies was really good

5526.0 --> 5533.84
for that time

5527.52 --> 5533.84
so much animated stuff

5567.12 --> 5571.92
ah it's nice that i still have them

5569.52 --> 5571.92
within

5572.84 --> 5575.84
reach

5586.84 --> 5589.84
so

5615.199 --> 5619.12
time warner has good animators

5620.32 --> 5622.88
it could be

5623.92 --> 5627.84
is that basically the time he

5628.84 --> 5631.84
collaborated

5683.6 --> 5686.639
