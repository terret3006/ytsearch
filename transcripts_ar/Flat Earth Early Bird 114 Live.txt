7.68 --> 42.37
[Music]

38.789 --> 46.539
good morning welcome to flatters

42.37 --> 51.699
earlybird number 114

46.539 --> 56.32
I'm your host our winner today it's

51.699 --> 64.71
quite a restless day like literally and

56.32 --> 64.71000000000001
metaphorically God

66.54 --> 72.84
after everything like after yesterday

69.84 --> 77.33
evening feels like everything has been

72.84 --> 77.33
spiraling out of control all of sudden

77.66 --> 85.07
and I'm doing pretty okay but yeah

88.1 --> 91.99
could be a lot better

93.1 --> 102.5
so yeah I got myself into a bit of

100.25 --> 107.33
financial trouble all of a sudden out of

102.5 --> 111.89
nowhere by forgetting my damn keys as I

107.33 --> 114.52
left the house on return there was

111.89 --> 114.52
nobody there

118.61 --> 122.72
and yeah

123.21 --> 128.89
also this is night like this massive

126.91 --> 134.14
storm just broke out

128.89 --> 136.41
it's totally Restless yeah I did find my

134.14 --> 136.41
keys

136.73 --> 144.79999999999998
right I usually leave them and I'm just

141.94 --> 149.87
stunned that I actually forgot them

144.8 --> 153.97
because that that doesn't happen I have

149.87 --> 158.48000000000002
a very strict routine like a

153.97 --> 161.35999999999999
foundational routine that pretty much

158.48 --> 166.0
rammed in their neurotically to prevent

161.36 --> 168.83
myself from forgetting it but the

166.0 --> 172.099
exhilaration of the entire conversation

168.83 --> 175.79000000000002
that went on for hours after the early

172.099 --> 180.79899999999998
bird show went offline just completely

175.79 --> 186.62
got distracted and my haste I forgot

180.799 --> 190.459
them it's so annoying so stupid so basic

186.62 --> 194.299
and so screwed because of it because

190.459 --> 198.59
yeah all the financial stability I have

194.299 --> 201.70000000000002
just been gathering it's all gone it's

198.59 --> 201.70000000000002
all gone oh great

203.79 --> 207.989
I'm gonna have to get out of this

211.9 --> 219.19
and yeah like it's not just that one

216.37 --> 223.36
thing just everything was crazy like the

219.19 --> 228.819
D&D that I did started out pretty ok and

223.36 --> 233.59
then just noticed that I was still too

228.819 --> 236.42999999999998
distracted by the entire situation from

233.59 --> 236.43
yesterday hold on

239.92 --> 246.05999999999997
[Music]

248.9 --> 251.949
[Music]

254.55 --> 257.58
[Music]

258.34 --> 264.23999999999995
and there it comes my landlord

261.2 --> 264.24
[Music]

274.31 --> 280.759
are you just gonna solve that today cuz

277.199 --> 283.199
yeah of course who doesn't have a giant

280.759 --> 285.81
smack of money on their bank account

283.199 --> 293.43
just for a Kade this kind of case like

285.81 --> 295.289
well me I don't technically couldn't

293.43 --> 296.27
even pay for it right now even if I

295.289 --> 298.53
wanted to

296.27 --> 303.39
it's just screwed

298.53 --> 308.38
[Music]

303.39 --> 311.2
yeah trying to reach my dad all that I

308.38 --> 313.59
see if he can back it up or whatever I

311.2 --> 317.32
don't know I don't know it sucks but

313.59 --> 319.84
yeah anyway continuing the indie session

317.32 --> 322.65
it was kind of okay but then I ended up

319.84 --> 326.13
in a position where I was just

322.65 --> 326.13
[Music]

328.66 --> 337.36
so distracted and sensitive to basically

333.03 --> 343.59999999999997
properly guide gamers as a game master

337.36 --> 345.88
and made the force to play roles as NPCs

343.6 --> 350.53000000000003
that were extremely uncomfortable and

345.88 --> 353.74
like they pushed it again freakin

350.53 --> 357.03999999999996
interrogations and going too far and

353.74 --> 362.28000000000003
just I didn't like it it's like yeah

357.04 --> 364.93
they were being technically taking

362.28 --> 367.71999999999997
advantage of the situation maneuvering

364.93 --> 373.23
very politically by their own standards

367.72 --> 376.39000000000004
and winning but just it felt so dark and

373.23 --> 382.18
I just didn't like it it was very

376.39 --> 384.93
uncomfortable sitting through it also

382.18 --> 387.49
just because I was too distracted

384.93 --> 389.95
basically couldn't handle the situation

387.49 --> 394.57
when it happened and I'm sure I'll be

389.95 --> 397.69
able to fix the issues or the balance

394.57 --> 400.84
later on for the next session but just

397.69 --> 403.21
yeah that happened then I came home then

400.84 --> 404.04999999999995
I figured out damn it my keys where the

403.21 --> 407.84999999999997
hell are my keys

404.05 --> 411.15000000000003
why didn't I notice this before

407.85 --> 412.92
and managed to get in the great

411.15 --> 416.64
foresight of knowing there's more [ __ ]

412.92 --> 418.83000000000004
coming and then I look into globe

416.64 --> 421.2
busters and see that oh yeah look

418.83 --> 425.87
Nathan just rage quit they're in a fight

421.2 --> 428.90999999999997
now goody-goody more in fighting hooray

425.87 --> 432.21
everything went to [ __ ] all at the same

428.91 --> 451.8
time all at once and a big storm and I

432.21 --> 457.419
feel like [ __ ] good so I did actually

451.8 --> 463.249
manage to contact my healer this morning

457.419 --> 467.239
consulted him extensively and I'm afraid

463.249 --> 471.139
that all my suspicions every single one

467.239 --> 473.82899999999995
of them were completely on target that's

471.139 --> 473.829
kind of unnerving

475.569 --> 485.41900000000004
so yeah I need to talk to Randy about

479.419 --> 488.919
this because yeah this is a potential

485.419 --> 491.919
danger might be a bit overrated

488.919 --> 491.919
but

494.44 --> 500.44
I think what happened to Randy is

497.01 --> 503.55
basically got caught in somebody yeah

500.44 --> 503.55
you could say his fell

505.069 --> 510.379
I can't blame him because he just got

508.009 --> 513.7090000000001
dropped a giant bomb of information on

510.379 --> 516.469
two very long time for for a first

513.709 --> 521.3599999999999
contact five hours that's insane

516.469 --> 524.4200000000001
so I already thought like yeah who's

521.36 --> 526.4300000000001
gonna do that just pile on all that

524.42 --> 529.79
information just the first contact

526.43 --> 533.18
that's felt like okay that's not how I

529.79 --> 535.7199999999999
would do it it's not balanced it's

533.18 --> 535.7199999999999
overkill

539.1 --> 543.63
it's a great likelihood that much of

541.019 --> 550.94
what he said although not everything is

543.63 --> 550.9399999999999
just a bluff in a way it's very tough

554.769 --> 561.649
that's more to be figured out but yeah

557.81 --> 564.9799999999999
it's safe to say that I I'm not gonna

561.649 --> 568.519
trust this guy though I may be open for

564.98 --> 571.759
some kind of contact but yeah I'm not

568.519 --> 575.389
gonna go into business or whatever and

571.759 --> 582.73
if that is even a real thing could just

575.389 --> 582.73
be a incentive to allure us in

585.12 --> 590.149
it's just everything is not nice

597.23 --> 601.72
[Music]

602.32 --> 604.62
all right

612.71 --> 621.5
yeah also kind of weird I guess a side

616.52 --> 627.23
note that the singer prodigy apparently

621.5 --> 630.11
committed suicide yesterday well don't

627.23 --> 634.07
think nobody saw that coming with the

630.11 --> 637.61
type of mania that the guy was into yeah

634.07 --> 642.4590000000001
get really manic sometimes should just

637.61 --> 646.1
do that just just go

642.459 --> 648.1999999999999
so that is sad for me person I used to

646.1 --> 650.51
listen to the prodigy a lot especially

648.2 --> 653.2700000000001
in the early days I really like their

650.51 --> 656.6
earlier works and then after a while it

653.27 --> 659.6899999999999
started to go a bit downhill for me like

656.6 --> 665.48
can be generated in my personal feeling

659.69 --> 668.5400000000001
and got worse I just I really like the

665.48 --> 672.38
old prodigy and I don't like the newer

668.54 --> 678.31
things they did but yeah it's still kind

672.38 --> 678.31
of sad so that happen

696.73 --> 700.33
[ __ ] I hate it

703.31 --> 707.439
and it's season chat for a moment

710.02 --> 714.87

868.69 --> 873.9100000000001
Freemasonry and the parallel dimensions

872.17 --> 877.63
and what supposedly is going on over

873.91 --> 881.41
there it was intense maybe a little bit

877.63 --> 884.68
too intense for my taste like I like to

881.41 --> 887.3399999999999
keep things subtle and that didn't

884.68 --> 889.29
really happen yesterday and it's just I

887.34 --> 891.639
[Music]

889.29 --> 895.24
won't had I was kind of relief to

891.639 --> 898.1800000000001
finally find people that were getting it

895.24 --> 900.85
as it were what I've been trying to

898.18 --> 906.55
subtly share with everyone over the

900.85 --> 912.7900000000001
years but it kind of felt like it was

906.55 --> 916.24
being broken into it's like yesterday

912.79 --> 919.029
yesterday okay look look at the YouTube

916.24 --> 924.04
screen flat earth early-bird number 114

919.029 --> 926.759
so it's num number 130 yesterday don't

924.04 --> 926.759
be basic

934.69 --> 940.0600000000001
I will link why should I throw in a link

937.48 --> 944.44
to yesterday's hangout just go to my

940.06 --> 946.5089999999999
channel click videos and then click 130

944.44 --> 950.139
it's yesterday but it's a long hangout

946.509 --> 953.39
so what do it now unless you yea don't

950.139 --> 956.429
want to follow this hangout

953.39 --> 956.429
[Music]

971.61 --> 979.59
good right my approach on these topics

974.37 --> 983.76
is be careful don't overdo it don't be

979.59 --> 987.77
seduced by Lucifer don't be fooled by

983.76 --> 991.4
our Imam and from what I gathered and

987.77 --> 997.71
was confirmed by my healer this guy is

991.4 --> 1000.41
absolutely both and yeah it is sort of a

997.71 --> 1003.6800000000001
theory way you could say he wasn't

1000.41 --> 1006.79
really there he is being driven by the

1003.68 --> 1008.18
powers that are unleashed on him

1006.79 --> 1011.54
voluntarily

1008.18 --> 1018.28
I don't know but even the angel stated

1011.54 --> 1023.0899999999999
it could not be it could not be helped

1018.28 --> 1025.82
that's a important sign you know

1023.09 --> 1028.31
sometimes I do have like concerns about

1025.82 --> 1030.1399999999999
people then I asked my either like yeah

1028.31 --> 1032.9589999999998
can you can't do something about that

1030.14 --> 1036.1100000000001
and he does help some people

1032.959 --> 1038.42
but sometimes bump into people and it's

1036.11 --> 1041.4799999999998
like a karma thing or whatever and they

1038.42 --> 1046.5800000000002
cannot interfere and this is one of

1041.48 --> 1049.24
these people now yeah for example does

1046.58 --> 1052.07
he really have all these artifacts

1049.24 --> 1055.52
doesn't have some artifacts or is it

1052.07 --> 1060.52
just a bluff is it a giant bluff because

1055.52 --> 1060.52
it's not that hard to do that you know

1061.43 --> 1065.49
hangout link right hangout link is in

1064.95 --> 1068.28

1131.58 --> 1142.1

1136.799 --> 1142.1
[ __ ] it's kind of a relatively okay day

1142.639 --> 1150.119
you can still see some blue here and

1145.289 --> 1154.129
there but it's blowing hard still some

1150.119 --> 1154.129
sort so could be worse I guess

1165.11 --> 1169.0
I know

1187.14 --> 1195.0300000000002
okay a new rule new rule okay anyone

1275.48 --> 1279.47
whatever comes in from people watching

1277.79 --> 1281.6299999999999
the advertisement so every time a

1279.47 --> 1287.75
freaking advertisers pop up watch it

1281.63 --> 1289.91
click it do that and I might eventually

1287.75 --> 1293.06
get to getting that money if YouTube

1289.91 --> 1297.0800000000002
isn't shut down before that possibility

1496.049 --> 1502.62
to get to know people I'm building

1497.82 --> 1506.03
skills I'm trying to build momentum I'm

1502.62 --> 1506.03
doing all that but

1508.07 --> 1512.6
it's not going anywhere quickly it's not

1511.01 --> 1515.33

1551.79 --> 1555.47
[Music]

1556.99 --> 1564.29
right but technically yeah it's always

1561.5 --> 1567.71
been financial [ __ ] that has caused me

1564.29 --> 1569.54
the worst aches the biggest worries and

1567.71 --> 1573.89
that's just it's like an allergic

1569.54 --> 1576.07
response makes me irrationally nervous

1573.89 --> 1580.13
about that [ __ ]

1576.07 --> 1585.83
but yeah if I manage to fix that and

1580.13 --> 1589.7
I've been blessed so far widely with my

1585.83 --> 1592.6999999999998
friends and my dad just people helping

1589.7 --> 1595.8500000000001
me out then I'll get out of this as well

1592.7 --> 1599.75
but yeah because the rest you know it

1595.85 --> 1602.99
sucks all these little things they suck

1599.75 --> 1605.96
but it's not something they'll like

1602.99 --> 1609.82
weigh on me heavily it's just kind of

1605.96 --> 1613.8500000000001
expected after a day like yesterday

1609.82 --> 1616.1899999999998
getting so deeply into that that other

1613.85 --> 1618.11

1616.19 --> 1621.1100000000001
ghost stories and she had based on real

1618.11 --> 1626.54
experiences yeah that's the kind of [ __ ]

1621.11 --> 1629.99
that tends to happen that's why you

1626.54 --> 1632.3799999999999
don't like hear everybody talking about

1629.99 --> 1636.67
that [ __ ] everywhere all the time

1632.38 --> 1636.67

1960.39 --> 1968.0900000000001
no trolling go somewhere else if you

1963.929 --> 1968.0900000000001
want to do that [ __ ] get a freakin life

1985.9 --> 1997.0590000000002
right finally an actual question under

1991.6 --> 2000.33
Omega right well Nathan I haven't

1997.059 --> 2002.34
actually seen it but that was on it was

2000.33 --> 2004.29
only a matter of time before something

2002.34 --> 2009.9499999999998
like that happened because yeah if you

2004.29 --> 2009.95
have paid any kind of attention right

2014.59 --> 2021.1
yeah there's always been something

2017.23 --> 2024.07
between those like friction stuff Bob

2021.1 --> 2027.1
like trolling him like being really

2024.07 --> 2029.71
nasty in chats and everything to to

2027.1 --> 2031.6899999999998
Nathan while Nathan didn't really

2029.71 --> 2035.74
deserve that and yeah Nathan it does

2031.69 --> 2039.549
have like a been a bit of a whip himself

2035.74 --> 2041.19
and look Nathan's been hammering in the

2039.549 --> 2043.48
recent times much more on the

2041.19 --> 2045.97
technicalities of the use of language

2043.48 --> 2051.089
with which is kind of an important part

2045.97 --> 2054.55
it's to get things straight and Bob

2051.089 --> 2055.139
doesn't seem to be one in the one to do

2054.55 --> 2058.48
that

2055.139 --> 2063.0
like some other flat-earthers too by the

2058.48 --> 2068.379
way we're hanging in the background and

2063.0 --> 2070.659
yeah Nathan just went straight to the

2068.379 --> 2072.7599999999998
court debate Flat Earth debate style and

2070.659 --> 2078.329
just probably completely grilled him

2072.76 --> 2081.7000000000003
over it and Bob got all pissy so yeah

2078.329 --> 2083.5
semantics that's it that's and it got

2081.7 --> 2085.649
out of control it was only a matter of

2083.5 --> 2085.649
time

2093.31 --> 2101.44
no they have not been used why would you

2097.6 --> 2104.19
even bring that up forage why are you

2101.44 --> 2104.19
saying that

2107.19 --> 2112.1
look at yourself why are you saying that

2109.8 --> 2112.1000000000004

that but I can't be driving in a vehicle

2346.85 --> 2351.92

2360.859 --> 2370.459
they've got stomach surgery whoo yeah

2366.16 --> 2376.5389999999998
ventricle hernia ahead feel them I up in

2370.459 --> 2376.5389999999998
my chest okay

2376.67 --> 2395.239
it doesn't sound nice so yep over there

2389.209 --> 2402.44
I can barely make a half of what you're

2395.239 --> 2405.14
saying your yeah you might want to retry

2402.44 --> 2413.119
to join see if it works or otherwise

2405.14 --> 2416.3489999999997
yeah the connection just sucks I'm in

2413.119 --> 2416.349
Michigan it's pretty

2436.89 --> 2441.3199999999997
yeah this knife was just crazy

2443.7 --> 2449.98
like in the morning I woke up like

2447.34 --> 2453.28
sweating and it just didn't stop that

2449.98 --> 2455.59
basically covered myself in towels to

2453.28 --> 2466.1800000000003
try and sleep again because that was the

2455.59 --> 2477.19
only way to get it away to welcome back

2466.18 --> 2479.74
our sounds the same say I think it's

2477.19 --> 2484.9500000000003
where my router [ __ ] house and where

2479.74 --> 2484.95
I'm at okay

2501.44 --> 2511.23
about it my video walk can you hear me

2504.06 --> 2512.369
better now yeah maybe you can hear you

2511.23 --> 2514.5
can hear me a little bit better now

2512.369 --> 2519.53
right yeah yeah it's going much more

2514.5 --> 2525.72
fluid now yeah let's lay my your broader

2519.53 --> 2529.13
mission cuz I said okay let me take that

2525.72 --> 2529.1299999999997
back it's not going better

2532.22 --> 2540.93
canopy's Eman freaking out I have one

2537.75 --> 2542.58
eye I have one but ever since I figured

2540.93 --> 2549.24
out how to do this on the go I'm just

2542.58 --> 2551.91
using my cell phone alright well it's

2549.24 --> 2555.39
very handy but if you got a PC or a

2551.91 --> 2557.58
laptop or anything then just do that

2555.39 --> 2560.609
because you can do it landlines and

2557.58 --> 2563.869
works so much more stable than through

2560.609 --> 2563.869
Wi-Fi and everything

2565.25 --> 2572.04
but yeah we'll see what we can do with

2567.51 --> 2576.0200000000004
this for now yeah what kind of side work

2572.04 --> 2579.7799999999997
you've been trying to get into side work

2576.02 --> 2585.14
yes well I haven't really been getting

2579.78 --> 2588.51
into a lot of things okay because yeah

2585.14 --> 2591.2999999999997
even trying to find jobs just frustrates

2588.51 --> 2593.4900000000002
the hell out of me like seriously

2591.3 --> 2597.36
because I put so much effort into it

2593.49 --> 2600.27
every time to just be shoved aside like

2597.36 --> 2604.98
a number and that's like traumatizing

2600.27 --> 2608.04
sounds really stupid but it is like it's

2604.98 --> 2609.87
shocking to me because I've put in

2608.04 --> 2612.33
everything and then I get nothing and

2609.87 --> 2614.43
then I'm just expected yeah just keep on

2612.33 --> 2617.58
doing that yeah just doing 50 times in a

2614.43 --> 2619.44
row just take the punishment one day

2617.58 --> 2621.72
you'll get something out of it you just

2619.44 --> 2623.9700000000003
have to expend some more in the attempt

2621.72 --> 2625.98
to try to find a resource to get more

2623.97 --> 2629.52
money because that's the best way to get

2625.98 --> 2631.23
money is to hand out more money without

2629.52 --> 2633.09
guarantees you're actually gonna get

2631.23 --> 2638.94
something back in return it's brilliant

2633.09 --> 2641.7000000000003
such a great system I love it not so

2638.94 --> 2644.43
well I mean what is doing through I've

2641.7 --> 2647.1899999999996
been doing like paper rounds here but

2644.43 --> 2649.2599999999998
it's it's [ __ ] it's more like a social

job that I do because a lot of people

2649.26 --> 2655.4300000000003
are happy about it because it don't make

2651.3 --> 2655.4300000000003
[ __ ] from it nothing

2655.91 --> 2665.509
so uh the I I own my own business here

2660.279 --> 2668.18

2668.18 --> 2675.529
construction unions a lot of jobs I've

2671.99 --> 2679.25
worked for a lot of people and about

2675.529 --> 2681.799
four years ago now you know I didn't you

2679.25 --> 2685.16
know my mindset was you know I don't

2681.799 --> 2688.19
want this company to make millions off

2685.16 --> 2691.009
of me I want to make the millions right

2688.19 --> 2693.71

2709.369 --> 2715.4300000000003
amount of money being a business owner

2712.4 --> 2718.73
then working for a corporation and

2715.43 --> 2720.5
getting you know a paycheck from them I

2718.73 --> 2722.96
think I would make more money

2720.5 --> 2726.259
eighty ninety thousand a year instead of

2722.96 --> 2728.569
my well I don't make you know I make

2726.259 --> 2730.099
like forty thousand but I still get to

2859.099 --> 2864.349
business information on Google and then

2862.489 --> 2866.329
from there you you know you don't have

2864.349 --> 2868.13
to pay for any advertisement you know I

2866.329 --> 2870.4700000000003
don't ever pay for advertisement that's

2877.309 --> 2882.2000000000003
money back you know it's you might make

2879.769 --> 2884.749
that money back but you're not gonna

2882.2 --> 2886.999
profit from that advertisement you're

2884.749 --> 2888.859
gonna profit from word-of-mouth and

2886.999 --> 2890.799
that's where I've gotten a lot of my

2888.859 --> 2893.95
jobs is just word of mouth

2890.799 --> 2893.95
all right

2895.16 --> 2899.46
but yeah I can help you uh you know

2897.9 --> 2903.6
start out I've helped a couple of my

2899.46 --> 2905.85
guys my buddy of Jose he's uh East Costa

2903.6 --> 2908.0099999999998
Rican and I helped him start his

2905.85 --> 2911.0699999999997
landscape company you know by putting

2908.01 --> 2913.8900000000003
him on Google and when I met him he was

2911.07 --> 2916.56
only you know 20 20 you know 20

2913.89 --> 2921.5699999999997
contracts and now he's over 70 contracts

2916.56 --> 2923.52
now so I mean it and it is a big

2921.57 --> 2926.07
difference you know cuz he'd mows lon it

2923.52 --> 2928.38
does snow removal and it's a big

2926.07 --> 2930.63
difference from 20 contracts to 60

2928.38 --> 2933.81
contracts so now he has three full-time

2930.63 --> 2935.94
employees helping him and he's doing

2933.81 --> 2939.27
he's doing a lot better now because of

2935.94 --> 2940.59
you know we put him on Google we put him

2939.27 --> 2942.39
I don't know if you got a Google

2940.59 --> 2944.19
platform down there where you can Google

2942.39 --> 2945.98
business but you should I think it's all

2944.19 --> 2951.75
around the world

2945.98 --> 2957.75
sure probably you have you just got to

2951.75 --> 2958.91
create a Google business account do you

2957.75 --> 2963.5
know about that

2958.91 --> 2966.77
no not really it's

2963.5 --> 2969.56
yeah I know that sort of stuff is it

2966.77 --> 2974.21
does exist and there's like it's been

2969.56 --> 2978.29
pretty much going on outside of my field

2974.21 --> 2981.65
of knowledge and mostly just terrifies

2978.29 --> 2984.89
me to be fair it's just like boots all

2981.65 --> 2988.21
this stuff is going so fast and I don't

2984.89 --> 2990.95
have a feel for this anymore

2988.21 --> 2993.08
yeah everything everything is moving

2990.95 --> 2994.609
technology is moving too quickly you

2993.08 --> 2997.0099999999998
know where it's everything's just moving

2994.609 --> 2999.38
too quickly and a lot of these you know

2997.01 --> 3002.2000000000003
people they can't comprehend all these

2999.38 --> 3004.03
and my grand grandparents they still

3002.2 --> 3006.609
don't even have a cell phone or laptop

3004.03 --> 3011.4900000000002
or a computer you know they still they

3006.609 --> 3011.49
just couldn't adapt into that technology

3012.3 --> 3019.9300000000003
all right yeah why I haven't in last 20

3015.94 --> 3022.5
years so I know I heard vfe add that

3019.93 --> 3028.7999999999997
there are some things out there that

3022.5 --> 3031.56
supposedly work with I just I hate it

3028.8 --> 3034.29
and everything is getting squeezed

3031.56 --> 3036.75
anyway it's always like Oh something new

3034.29 --> 3040.23
oh look there's profit here and let's

3036.75 --> 3041.85
adapt do that and then the rest of the

3040.23 --> 3043.8
world catches on and suddenly there's

3041.85 --> 3046.52
too much competition and the Texas come

3043.8 --> 3048.9300000000003
in and yeah you're screwed again and

3046.52 --> 3052.37
that what's that's what keeps on

3048.93 --> 3052.37
happening all the time

3052.97 --> 3062.1899999999996
yeah we just we just have to adapt to

3056.66 --> 3064.5899999999997
what to who why why would this to be

3062.19 --> 3074.46
done it's ridiculous it's a ridiculous

3064.59 --> 3076.83
game we were playing their game right

3074.46 --> 3079.11
now

3076.83 --> 3081.0
oh yeah end up really with is just being

3079.11 --> 3082.9700000000003
a little bit better in the game and the

3081.0 --> 3089.1
people that are not are just screwed

3082.97 --> 3091.8599999999997
that's really good and I'm still young

3089.1 --> 3095.7799999999997
Ireland you know I'm only 28 and I

3091.86 --> 3098.4
started my business young you know so

3095.78 --> 3103.3500000000004
then it got me to a point two years ago

3098.4 --> 3106.02
I bought a house I mean I didn't take

3103.35 --> 3110.42
cash for the house it's a mortgage but

3106.02 --> 3110.42
mortgage is way cheaper than rent

3116.579 --> 3119.329
I guess so

3121.57 --> 3127.84
but now I have to fix everything ruff

3125.11 --> 3132.04
myself you know instead of having a

3127.84 --> 3138.8500000000004
landlord or a company corporation come

3132.04 --> 3142.0299999999997
fix it for me right well that's yeah

3138.85 --> 3144.85
it's just yours then you can fix it any

3142.03 --> 3148.8700000000003
way you see fit that's the difference

3144.85 --> 3155.83
that's a lot more attractive to me of

3148.87 --> 3157.8399999999997
course no no we're gonna start you out

3155.83 --> 3161.17
slow and you know what we'll get

3157.84 --> 3163.84

3167.5 --> 3173.17
and uh and we can we can help you get

3171.43 --> 3175.14
started you know all you have to do is

3173.17 --> 3177.52
it could be like Arwen's handyman's

3175.14 --> 3180.3399999999997
that's how it's gonna be or you know a

3177.52 --> 3184.48

anything but I'm not good at do it

3215.62 --> 3221.91

and [ __ ] like that you know right like

3479.859 --> 3488.59
merchandising yes right I thought about

3482.51 --> 3491.1800000000003
that you know what it costs money yeah

3488.59 --> 3492.83
hey but you don't you don't have to tell

3491.18 --> 3497.0299999999997
how much that cause it's not gonna cost

3492.83 --> 3499.13
you $100 no but it's gonna cost me $2 $4

3497.03 --> 3501.17
a time first I have to do better

3499.13 --> 3503.33
Benna can actually do that and yeah

3501.17 --> 3506.39
that's in the plan I got plans the

3503.33 --> 3508.43
problem is the money always the freaking

3506.39 --> 3510.41
money and then everything goes pretty

3508.43 --> 3512.75
smoothly and then something shitty

3510.41 --> 3516.44
happens that didn't need to happen and

3512.75 --> 3518.72
suddenly like chunk like the half money

3516.44 --> 3521.119
for freaking out a half a month it just

3518.72 --> 3521.99
thrown in the garbage can for absolutely

3521.119 --> 3525.29
nothing

3521.99 --> 3529.3399999999997
yeah it's all gotta [ __ ] okay that's

3525.29 --> 3531.7
where I'm at and I'm sick that it I'm

3529.34 --> 3534.98
just sick of it that it works this way

3531.7 --> 3538.49
you know so I'm Nicolas I just had to

3534.98 --> 3540.109
put $8,000 into my truck you know [ __ ]

3538.49 --> 3542.27
that I didn't want to happen you know

3540.109 --> 3545.359
you know an engine blew and once the

3542.27 --> 3547.13
engine blows in in a diesel truck you

3545.359 --> 3548.68
know you got to replace the turbo and a

3547.13 --> 3550.48
turbo was [ __ ] you know

3548.68 --> 3557.3489999999997
I know that kind of [ __ ] or else I want

3550.48 --> 3558.04
to bought the damn truck happens to

3557.349 --> 3565.119
everybody

3558.04 --> 3567.7599999999998
hey oh yeah if you have a business then

3565.119 --> 3568.96
you're tied in to that ship and that's

3567.76 --> 3572.88
not nothing

3568.96 --> 3575.2
well yeah you also got stuff to

3572.88 --> 3580.03
counterbalance that and you got

3575.2 --> 3584.74
flexibility you got dynamics you got

3580.03 --> 3585.579
people depending on you that's yeah it's

3584.74 --> 3587.5299999999997
hard it's hard

3585.579 --> 3589.9300000000003
I have people depending on me yeah so if

3587.53 --> 3591.4
I don't keep them busy they're just

3589.93 --> 3595.0
gonna go find something else to do

3591.4 --> 3600.4
alright well in a way I do too here in

3595.0 --> 3602.53
this show so I'm just gonna do this for

3600.4 --> 3604.329
now and look I got other skills like I'm

3602.53 --> 3606.4
still a goldsmith although I haven't

3604.329 --> 3609.8390000000004
practiced it for a long time but I can

3606.4 --> 3609.839
still do that you don't forget that

3612.03 --> 3617.52
yeah do like healer stuff and everything

3615.39 --> 3619.41
I've even considered like doing that

3617.52 --> 3626.34
advertising it professionally but

3619.41 --> 3629.94
there's just issues with that like if

3626.34 --> 3635.13
you're going to like directly trade off

3629.94 --> 3637.02
ethereal skills for money then it'll get

3635.13 --> 3639.27
a sucking effect and people will

3637.02 --> 3641.58
approach you that will drain you and

3639.27 --> 3643.47
make it impossible for you to keep on

3641.58 --> 3648.39
doing that without destroying it

3643.47 --> 3651.6299999999997
freaking happens so it's just it's a

3648.39 --> 3653.85
tough dynamic the whole YouTube thing

3651.63 --> 3656.79
here seems to be pretty much the only

3653.85 --> 3659.91
thing that does really seem to be going

3656.79 --> 3666.44
for me well they're gonna start

3659.91 --> 3666.44
censoring a lot of [ __ ] that they do I

3666.65 --> 3672.78
guess that lady the owner of YouTube is

3670.19 --> 3675.69
there they're trying to create a new

3672.78 --> 3678.17
algorithm or some [ __ ] I heard yeah

3675.69 --> 3678.17
that's stupid

3680.12 --> 3685.29
right yeah but thank you by the way the

3682.71 --> 3688.83
mind of God for the $2 super chat much

3685.29 --> 3690.42
appreciated peace are we in much of the

3688.83 --> 3692.2
world is in pain sadly

3690.42 --> 3696.099
yep

3692.2 --> 3698.89
and just to respond to miss il only the

3696.099 --> 3702.099
wise the most successful people take the

3698.89 --> 3703.24
biggest risk yeah and the majority of

3702.099 --> 3708.78
them fail

3703.24 --> 3712.1189999999997
utterly not the majority of them yeah

3708.78 --> 3720.76
yeah they do the ones that take the

3712.119 --> 3723.1600000000003
biggest risk yeah they do that's why

3720.76 --> 3724.7200000000003
it's a big risk if the biggest risk

3723.16 --> 3726.8799999999997
would always be winning then everybody

3724.72 --> 3730.45
would be going to the casino and getting

3726.88 --> 3733.359
rich doesn't happen and neither does it

3730.45 --> 3745.7799999999997
in in the working world and all that

3733.359 --> 3748.3489999999997
stuff so yeah so but look swinging up

3745.78 --> 3750.8190000000004
the pendulum it's just shitty now and I

3748.349 --> 3753.88
have to figure out how to get through

3750.819 --> 3756.0099999999998
this and as soon as I got a solution to

3753.88 --> 3758.319
this financial situation I'll probably

3756.01 --> 3760.1800000000003
be instantly in a better mood and it

3758.319 --> 3762.13
will be like Oh like nothing ever

3760.18 --> 3766.3489999999997
happened almost because that's just how

3762.13 --> 3766.349
this [ __ ] includes me and it sucks

3775.56 --> 3787.23
right you got it you got any paper

3786.21 --> 3800.15
rusted it later

3787.23 --> 3800.15
no and Wednesday but

3802.28 --> 3809.6090000000004
the whole thing is just things are going

3806.07 --> 3811.4700000000003
absolutely fine doing good just

3809.609 --> 3818.94
something little shitty and suddenly

3811.47 --> 3822.2999999999997
it's all out of whack and more annoying

3818.94 --> 3826.32
it's because of my own stupidity again

3822.3 --> 3830.76
it seems like every time I'm seduced by

3826.32 --> 3833.19
some kind of thing or I'm overly

3830.76 --> 3837.57
enthusiastic and I'm in a hurry and then

3833.19 --> 3844.9500000000003
everything goes to [ __ ] massive

3837.57 --> 3847.25
punishment hate it because I was doing

3844.95 --> 3847.25
great

3850.4 --> 3856.989
so yeah I'm not gonna be

3853.96 --> 3856.989
[Music]

3857.22 --> 3865.8689999999997
bringing a lot of good spirits today

3859.69 --> 3870.4
sorry about that but yeah anyways thanks

3865.869 --> 3873.28
flatlines for yeah for the support and

3870.4 --> 3874.9900000000002
the advice and yeah I think probably a

3873.28 --> 3879.0400000000004
lot of it is good advice

3874.99 --> 3880.75
just not ready to handle it right now by

3879.04 --> 3881.349
the way your sound quality did get a lot

3880.75 --> 3884.5
better

3881.349 --> 3887.05
I was standing closer I got a I got a

3884.5 --> 3889.24
four thousand square foot house so it's

3887.05 --> 3899.29
kind of hard to have a router you gotta

3889.24 --> 3901.68
kind of be within a router range so I'm

3899.29 --> 3901.68
in the kitchen

3907.06 --> 3910.68
wrong rolling a doobie

3916.15 --> 3923.9100000000003
I think Nathan started already also okay

3932.43 --> 3938.77
cool what seems somebody in chat was

3935.38 --> 3941.2000000000003
inspired by your advice take up a Google

3938.77 --> 3943.78
business yeah look as soon as I can make

3941.2 --> 3948.45
up my mind about okay this is something

3943.78 --> 3950.11
that will work absolutely then sure go

3948.45 --> 3953.3799999999997
for it

3950.11 --> 3955.33
oh it will work but I have tried out

3953.38 --> 3958.4500000000003
stuff before it didn't really work out

3955.33 --> 3960.19
even with help that's you just got to

3958.45 --> 3961.6
put in an algorithm yeah I'm gonna have

3960.19 --> 3964.0
to teach you cuz I didn't even know

3961.6 --> 3967.96
about it in an algorithm you're gonna

3964.0 --> 3974.14
put in keywords you know so in those

3967.96 --> 3976.71
keywords people start searching you up

3974.14 --> 3976.71
quicker

3981.789 --> 3985.73
like you're gonna have to you know

3983.509 --> 3987.68
download Google keywords and then see

3985.73 --> 3990.23
what people are searching up in your

3987.68 --> 3992.6299999999997
area you know it's a little bit

3990.23 --> 3996.109
different or difficult but you know once

3992.63 --> 4001.029
you get the hand of the it's easy cuz

3996.109 --> 4004.0589999999997
I'm not even computer savvy you know all

4001.029 --> 4005.829
right I had the guy who broke my phone I

4004.059 --> 4007.7690000000002
dropped my phone from like 30 feet up in

4005.829 --> 4010.48
the air and a couple weeks ago a

4007.769 --> 4012.0989999999997
broke-ass article get enough alone you

4010.48 --> 4014.14
know a dude I had a whole bunch of [ __ ]

4012.099 --> 4017.4300000000003
I'm here I don't even know my passwords

4014.14 --> 4019.9
and whatnot so buddy he did it for me

4017.43 --> 4022.21
put all that stuff that's I couldn't get

4019.9 --> 4042.2490000000003
that hang things I don't it wasn't

4022.21 --> 4045.819
working or whatever but you said

4042.249 --> 4047.6499999999996
Nathan's Nathan just got ya started up

4045.819 --> 4049.599
yeah I think I'm gonna run that to show

4047.65 --> 4051.39
it's like what my modes not gonna get

4049.599 --> 4054.94
any better

4051.39 --> 4056.319
but yeah I'm kind of interested reading

4054.94 --> 4058.18
what people are saying you like what

4056.319 --> 4065.339
they're doing it's it's really

4058.18 --> 4065.339
interesting you go back

4075.41 --> 4083.0499999999997
just gonna figure out something see you

4080.87 --> 4083.0499999999997
know

4087.549 --> 4095.359
and somehow get this you know the whole

4092.9 --> 4099.079
thing is the drive with me like it has

4095.359 --> 4101.7789999999995
to be sustainable it has to be stable I

4099.079 --> 4105.199
have to be able to keep on doing it

4101.779 --> 4110.900000000001
without breaking down and that's always

4105.199 --> 4115.759
been very tough to find cuz every time I

4110.9 --> 4118.219
try something it tests me so badly it's

4115.759 --> 4121.219
like yeah everybody knows getting a new

4118.219 --> 4124.15
job tests you this and that but seems to

4121.219 --> 4131.029
just go way beyond what regular people

4124.15 --> 4133.46
experiencing that kind of [ __ ] doesn't

4131.029 --> 4138.559
really help a lot that experience it

4133.46 --> 4140.9890000000005
like that and I'm just know that's what

4138.559 --> 4143.809
makes you should make you you know you

4140.989 --> 4145.629999999999
know but what you're trying to do it no

4143.809 --> 4149.150000000001
yeah right but you gotta have the

4145.63 --> 4151.400000000001
opportunity first and the conviction

4149.15 --> 4153.589
like that it's actually sustainable and

4151.4 --> 4156.348999999999
many things don't turn out to be

4153.589 --> 4159.7699999999995
sustainable here they just turn out to

4156.349 --> 4162.349
be enslaving and like yeah we'll give

4159.77 --> 4165.759
you some but you will see parts of you

4162.349 --> 4171.039
crumble cumulative ly as you go and

4165.759 --> 4171.039
that's the condition basically

4172.44 --> 4177.75
like people in business here start to

4175.71 --> 4180.3
tinker on your mind like yeah you're

4177.75 --> 4184.11
thinking the wrong way you have to use

4180.3 --> 4187.2
this methodology you have to give up on

4184.11 --> 4190.65
common decency all that [ __ ] it happens

4187.2 --> 4195.65
and I'm highly allergic to it and I'm

4190.65 --> 4199.5599999999995
just specific not everybody does that

4195.65 --> 4202.28
I'm just I need to quit this this

4199.56 --> 4206.75
subject and this hangout and

4202.28 --> 4209.92
yeah we have everybody probably laughing

4206.75 --> 4212.68
what's the open yeah that as well I

4209.92 --> 4215.75
should probably get over there well

4212.68 --> 4216.320000000001
alright hey if you if you're on later

4215.75 --> 4222.14
man

4216.32 --> 4223.79
or tomorrow you know I'll hit you up or

4222.14 --> 4225.4400000000005
just message me and well we'll get to

4223.79 --> 4232.34
that Google thing we'll start that

4225.44 --> 4235.25
Google you know right what I still

4232.34 --> 4238.39
recommend to just get a laptop or PC and

4235.25 --> 4244.22
just use Skype that's so much easier for

4238.39 --> 4247.7300000000005
me but yeah we'll see you next time

4244.22 --> 4248.72
anyway thanks for coming on the show all

4247.73 --> 4251.5599999999995
right thanks i won

4248.72 --> 4251.56
alright see ya

4256.15 --> 4262.82
so yeah thanks guys for your support and

4259.719 --> 4267.29
yeah good to hear that you have found

4262.82 --> 4271.82
ways to sustain yourself to get through

4267.29 --> 4274.159
all this I in the sense also dead until

4271.82 --> 4277.94
[ __ ] goes wrong and then everything's

4274.159 --> 4284.2699999999995
screwed and I might be able to recover

4277.94 --> 4288.489
this I don't know it's just a test it it

4284.27 --> 4292.9400000000005
freakin feels like a test it feels

4288.489 --> 4295.909
because what happened and we can it's

4292.94 --> 4299.48
just like okay you went there right now

4295.909 --> 4303.348999999999
here and everything at the same time I

4299.48 --> 4307.159
suffer feel the powerlessness feel the

4303.349 --> 4308.78
hope and you just leaking away and you

4307.159 --> 4310.489
can't get over it there's nothing you

4308.78 --> 4312.17
can actively do about it you're just

4310.489 --> 4316.718999999999
gonna have to sit through it again for a

4312.17 --> 4319.4890000000005
day to recover or whatever and then

4316.719 --> 4323.63
it'll just switch around again and

4319.489 --> 4325.61
everything works out so yeah that's my

4323.63 --> 4328.429
conclusion pretty much and it has been

4325.61 --> 4331.299999999999
many times every time I feel like this

4328.429 --> 4333.9400000000005
really nothing I can really do about it

4331.3 --> 4338.92
because it just doesn't work anymore

4333.94 --> 4338.919999999999
until I recover and then it works again

4339.669 --> 4345.449
and there's nothing really active I can

4342.039 --> 4348.449
do about it right for an itch

4345.449 --> 4348.449
exactly

4350.0 --> 4353.039
[Music]

4353.499 --> 4361.65
that's right and positive manifestation

4356.229 --> 4361.650000000001
well I do that but

4365.4 --> 4370.74
I look I still do that okay I'm not

4367.98 --> 4375.209999999999
letting it literally get me depressed

4370.74 --> 4377.88
I'm just suffering little not even that

4375.21 --> 4380.51
much it's just like everything went so

4377.88 --> 4385.83
well seemingly had so much energy and

4380.51 --> 4388.320000000001
then it it became too much and now it's

4385.83 --> 4391.61
just the punishment like oh you went

4388.32 --> 4391.61
there okay there you go

4393.32 --> 4404.73
so yeah it's just gonna be what it is

4399.57 --> 4410.5199999999995
for now that would be in a lot better

4404.73 --> 4413.7
mood tomorrow and yeah that when you're

4410.52 --> 4417.21
in that state you can think all positive

4413.7 --> 4419.16
but it's it's gonna be an intellectual

4417.21 --> 4423.35
construct because feelings are just not

4419.16 --> 4423.349999999999
gonna work like that the time

4442.079 --> 4448.11
well you know what maybe maybe it is

4445.59 --> 4450.869000000001
again time for me to just take a look at

4448.11 --> 4453.598999999999
the superficial job market and just see

4450.869 --> 4457.17
what out there there's anything that

4453.599 --> 4458.7300000000005
makes any kind of damn sense what's

4457.17 --> 4460.71
probably even gonna work out better if

4458.73 --> 4465.0
it just run into some real good people

4460.71 --> 4467.699
that ya can do it through networking but

4465.0 --> 4470.96
just in this world I don't know many

4467.699 --> 4477.119
people that that many people physically

4470.96 --> 4480.599
so whatever it needs to go it will go

4477.119 --> 4483.21
there I will go there and again there is

4480.599 --> 4485.4800000000005
stuff in the works on the long run it's

4483.21 --> 4487.949
always the long run never the short run

4485.48 --> 4489.54
then when I feel bad I always get

4487.949 --> 4492.329
paranoid to think like oh is it all just

4489.54 --> 4494.01
a big joke just a carrot in front of our

4492.329 --> 4495.42
wins face like oh yeah there's something

4494.01 --> 4497.01
better coming and then at the last

4495.42 --> 4500.659
moment it's gonna be taken away and it

4497.01 --> 4503.1900000000005
was all for nothing or not I don't know

4500.659 --> 4511.259999999999
and I feel like this I get it's very

4503.19 --> 4513.619
pessimistic about everything Oh God

4511.26 --> 4513.619000000001
but

4514.0 --> 4523.07
yeah that's not yeah that's not let me

4518.42 --> 4526.15
dwell on this [ __ ] for too long I I'm

4523.07 --> 4526.15
gonna round out the show

4530.92 --> 4537.76
and you jobs like I don't mind menial

4533.35 --> 4540.13
jobs it's just the conditions and what

4537.76 --> 4541.96
they expect and the papers and know

4540.13 --> 4543.31
there's people that's been doing that

4541.96 --> 4549.72
for twenty years that are looking for

4543.31 --> 4552.72
jobs and it's never straightforward

4549.72 --> 4552.72
