116.7 --> 125.18
just did like half an hour ago

120.72 --> 125.17999999999999
so a bit more clouded

128.039 --> 131.57999999999998
looks like it will be a bit of a rainy

130.619 --> 135.0
day

131.58 --> 138.86
despite that it's still warm I mean it

135.0 --> 138.86
really is still warm

140.7 --> 146.06
so that it's at least 20 degrees still

150.66 --> 154.7
right anyway plants are doing great

155.63 --> 164.12
[Music]

159.48 --> 164.11999999999998

it is Friday the 21st of July 2023

186.0 --> 191.04
okay

187.98 --> 193.56
right so yeah today I'm gonna take it a

191.04 --> 194.4
bit more easy I think although I don't

193.56 --> 197.3
know

194.4 --> 197.3
it wasn't

197.879 --> 202.459
because yesterday was such a great show

203.7 --> 208.26
I was very fluid I was very fractal as I

206.76 --> 210.599
kept in it

208.26 --> 213.379
very well so I'm very proud of

210.599 --> 213.379
yesterday's show

216.599 --> 219.61999999999998
ASAP happy

220.019 --> 225.72
right in yesterday's show I I barely

222.239 --> 227.58
even sweared or anything I mean it was

225.72 --> 232.019
really good

227.58 --> 234.36
uh today it's gonna be a shorter show

232.019 --> 238.76
because I'm a little late

234.36 --> 238.76000000000002
so keep staying up too late

243.239 --> 248.64000000000001
right but I mean Saturday I'll probably

246.06 --> 250.739
be doing another three hour stream and

248.64 --> 253.64
and all that

250.739 --> 253.64000000000001
but not today

255.299 --> 260.18
right so yeah I'm up for talking about

257.22 --> 260.18
whatever you like

260.22 --> 263.54
started too early

263.85 --> 267.06
[Music]

265.8 --> 268.56
uh

267.06 --> 271.139
no

268.56 --> 273.54
1pm Amsterdam time

271.139 --> 275.88
it's Friday it's not Saturday

273.54 --> 277.86
hey Terry 306

275.88 --> 280.02
sending this message for the third time

277.86 --> 283.699
um what oh okay

280.02 --> 283.69899999999996

299.759 --> 303.66
guts

301.38 --> 305.04
Gusto energy drink here I don't know if

303.66 --> 306.8
I'm gonna drink that

305.04 --> 309.12
Maybe

306.8 --> 312.74
Illuminati Castle

309.12 --> 312.74
definitely gonna eat that

312.84 --> 318.02
actually planning to eat it before the

314.88 --> 318.02
show but never got to it

332.6 --> 338.03900000000004
right yeah Terry I mean that might be

335.22 --> 340.28000000000003
because of I don't know your mobile or

338.039 --> 340.28
something

347.039 --> 352.15999999999997
maybe you're just having packet loss or

349.979 --> 352.15999999999997
something

360.18 --> 363.5
oh it's raining again

367.8 --> 371.40000000000003
last night was the worst one what do you

370.32 --> 373.68
mean

371.4 --> 376.69899999999996
there it up what's going on hey Richard

373.68 --> 376.699
G good to see you again

377.639 --> 382.62
do I ever get tired of Illuminati

379.86 --> 386.41900000000004
concerns yeah

382.62 --> 386.419
and then I don't eat them for a while

389.34 --> 393.29999999999995
especially in the times where I like eat

391.86 --> 396.24
very

393.3 --> 398.759
well and late it's like when I have

396.24 --> 402.259
dinner relatively late then I'm not as

398.759 --> 402.259
hungry as much in the morning

405.18 --> 411.919
so it all depends on like how I arrange

408.0 --> 411.919
my day with food habits

415.08 --> 417.199
thank you

424.02 --> 428.35999999999996
hey Bill Nye The Science and I are good

426.0 --> 428.36
to see you

429.47 --> 432.54900000000004
[Music]

441.9 --> 449.29999999999995
right so plenty going on

445.199 --> 449.3
fvd was very long again

449.52 --> 453.96
and like even after they have to show

451.979 --> 457.58
recording ended which was very late

453.96 --> 457.58
Nathan still hung around

459.66 --> 466.74
so I think we

462.479 --> 468.3
all dropped like at 7 pm Amsterdam time

466.74 --> 471.18
just

468.3 --> 473.22
I mean I I'm fine with those shows but I

471.18 --> 475.34000000000003
mean it's like a little bit too long for

473.22 --> 475.34000000000003
me

476.24 --> 482.16
but it doesn't seem like the guys of fed

479.099 --> 485.65999999999997
are having any problem with continually

482.16 --> 485.66
having these long shows

491.46 --> 497.52
but yeah me I kind of like want to move

494.58 --> 500.87899999999996
on after one point after a point

497.52 --> 505.099
I kind of like check out what what is

500.879 --> 505.09900000000005
going on over at The Alex Jones Show and

506.759 --> 511.139
and I mean sometimes over at the

509.16 --> 514.279
Alexandria is just like more local

511.139 --> 514.279
politics stuff

514.56 --> 521.279
and then yeah it's not super riveting

519.0 --> 523.02
so then I don't really mind if it is

521.279 --> 525.12
super long

523.02 --> 527.8389999999999
but other times it's a little bit more

525.12 --> 527.839
interesting

528.06 --> 533.88
and then I kind of just put fed like

531.0 --> 535.68
even the G Plus pen I just put it on a

533.88 --> 537.24
mute so I don't hear it and I just go do

535.68 --> 540.4399999999999
other stuff

537.24 --> 540.44
and then come back later

543.3 --> 548.18
whoa earthquake okay turret

555.42 --> 559.16
a rack on it okay

559.8 --> 562.04
foreign

567.5 --> 571.7
yeah that sounds weird tared

576.66 --> 580.519
hey steamy traveler good to see you

591.7 --> 594.889
[Music]

602.82 --> 607.9200000000001
does anyone know a very flattered School

605.88 --> 610.58
curriculum for Elementary School

607.92 --> 610.5799999999999
students

611.04 --> 613.6999999999999
what

614.16 --> 619.3389999999999
no

615.959 --> 619.3389999999999
I don't know any of that

623.42 --> 628.0799999999999
maybe you could ask

626.64 --> 629.1
it's funny that you mentioned that

628.08 --> 632.76
because

629.1 --> 635.64
you can ask Mitchell from Australia

632.76 --> 639.42
I noticed him like

635.64 --> 641.6999999999999
he's like back being active in Skype

639.42 --> 642.4799999999999
but I mean he's like really worked on

641.7 --> 646.019
that

642.48 --> 650.04
when he was making a lot of videos

646.019 --> 652.14
like making it all like

650.04 --> 654.66
usable for little kids he might have

652.14 --> 658.64
even like worked on that for his little

654.66 --> 658.64
kids so you could ask him

664.74 --> 668.279
I don't think he actually follows my

666.839 --> 672.9200000000001
show

668.279 --> 672.92
I think he might be like kind of a

672.98 --> 678.8000000000001
sheep Christian type like that

676.079 --> 681.66
but I don't know

678.8 --> 683.16
I I've seen him spend a lot of attention

681.66 --> 685.86
on that

683.16 --> 689.6999999999999
like flatter for little kids so

685.86 --> 692.66
you could ask him I know

689.7 --> 692.6600000000001
you have his channel

706.65 --> 709.6899999999999
[Music]

712.92 --> 718.25
foreign

715.06 --> 718.25
[Music]

720.53 --> 723.63
[Music]

733.5 --> 736.94
oh steam Traveler

737.519 --> 743.0
already yeah

739.5 --> 743.0
thank you for that steam Traveler

746.32 --> 758.6590000000001
[Music]

766.12 --> 774.179
[Music]

776.82 --> 780.0390000000001
[Music]

786.0 --> 788.72
foreign

800.0 --> 805.74
like the controllers of this Sim maybe

803.519 --> 807.779
Gaza has a message I mean that's a it's

805.74 --> 810.72
a frequency thing

807.779 --> 812.9399999999999
sound the sound of it Derek what you're

810.72 --> 815.639
describing when sadly all these things

812.94 --> 817.8000000000001
typically go wrong

815.639 --> 820.5790000000001
instead of it all goes right that's a

817.8 --> 820.579
frequency thing

821.399 --> 828.26
it actually has to do with like what's

823.98 --> 828.26
happening on on in your spirit

829.2 --> 835.38
with me that sort of weird series of

833.04 --> 839.399
disastrous events that always happens

835.38 --> 842.3
when I'm actually like really

839.399 --> 842.3
agitated

842.7 --> 848.6
and I can't let it go that's when that

845.399 --> 848.6
sort of thing starts happening

850.68 --> 856.38
so I always try to prevent that feeling

854.82 --> 860.399
because

856.38 --> 862.8
things in reality follow it really does

860.399 --> 865.5
as long as I avoid that from happening

862.8 --> 868.92
on in my spirit on the inside like

865.5 --> 871.079
really bad things don't actually happen

868.92 --> 875.0999999999999
and some things that you you could think

871.079 --> 877.1999999999999
of that is bad but you don't need to

875.1 --> 879.72
they're not that bad

877.2 --> 882.0600000000001
if you think of them as really bad and

879.72 --> 883.86
you draw that in and you say like Oh I'm

882.06 --> 885.4399999999999
a victim or something

883.86 --> 888.3000000000001
bad luck

885.44 --> 890.7790000000001
then more actual bad things start

888.3 --> 890.779
happening

896.04 --> 902.699
discuss yeah the rats is a bit weird

899.699 --> 905.2199999999999
are rats more common in in India because

902.699 --> 909.0
we don't see any rats here

905.22 --> 909.779
I mean maybe like more in the the inner

909.0 --> 913.68
city

909.779 --> 915.779
but I think that barely any rats

913.68 --> 919.699
there are mice though those are just

915.779 --> 919.699
like impossible to get rid of really

920.459 --> 925.26
like you get rid of them and then

922.079 --> 928.8599999999999
eventually they just come back

925.26 --> 932.699
like they spawn out of the ground

928.86 --> 932.6990000000001
like homunculus

935.88 --> 941.579
never any rats well what type of how did

939.18 --> 944.66
they look they might have been escaped

941.579 --> 944.66
pet rats

944.88 --> 952.56
did they look really dirty and skittish

948.959 --> 955.76
or were they like actually kind of like

952.56 --> 955.76
still neat looking

988.38 --> 992.519
you hear them laughing at you Bill Nye

990.959 --> 995.2399999999999
said wow

992.519 --> 995.24
okay

1006.98 --> 1012.5790000000001
what

1008.48 --> 1012.5790000000001
that's not how you spell my name

1020.66 --> 1025.24
thank you for that hello Shadow Man

1042.98 --> 1049.34
Fair ideap Google house mice

1047.12 --> 1054.4599999999998
no

1049.34 --> 1054.4599999999998
mice are much smaller than rats Derek

1054.5 --> 1060.919
I mean rats are usually like this big

1058.16 --> 1062.0
that's and with tail they can be even

1060.919 --> 1063.8600000000001
bigger

1062.0 --> 1067.179
and mice are like

1063.86 --> 1067.1789999999999
tiny compared

1078.86 --> 1085.9599999999998
they were house mice right yeah because

1082.4 --> 1085.96
rats are freaking huge

1087.5 --> 1095.02
and the rats are really smart and the

1089.96 --> 1095.02
mice mice are freaky because mice just

1096.62 --> 1103.82
like they just show up

1099.919 --> 1107.26
like did mice are not like even easy to

1103.82 --> 1107.26
trace where they're coming from

1109.64 --> 1115.7800000000002
like in here they literally just come

1112.76 --> 1115.78
out of the walls

1116.419 --> 1121.419
like holes in like we don't know where

1118.76 --> 1121.419
they're coming from

1122.84 --> 1128.059
makes us feel like there is like this

1125.0 --> 1130.1
giant underground mice complex that just

1128.059 --> 1132.94
happens to be connected to the hole in

1130.1 --> 1132.9399999999998
the wall or something

1134.96 --> 1143.66
because I mean out there there's cats

1139.039 --> 1143.66
like pretty much continually

1151.58 --> 1154.9399999999998
yeah my skin squeeze through tight

1153.559 --> 1157.58
spaces

1154.94 --> 1160.7
yeah but still they have to actually

1157.58 --> 1162.5
have spaces they actually have to come

1160.7 --> 1165.5
from somewhere

1162.5 --> 1167.679
they can't just straight go through a

1165.5 --> 1167.679
wall

1170.72 --> 1174.94
what what the hell are you saying

1177.2 --> 1182.2
it's a weird thing to say there Bill Nye

1179.419 --> 1182.2
the science Guyer

1190.22 --> 1194.74
live near the drain

1192.14 --> 1194.74
yeah

1195.38 --> 1199.24
Cinderella yeah okay

1205.28 --> 1209.72
okay

1207.26 --> 1211.96
I haven't actually seen the Cinderella

1209.72 --> 1211.96
movie

1226.72 --> 1232.88
yeah yeah but I know all about it

1229.22 --> 1236.179
because my door has like this tight

1232.88 --> 1238.64
space beneath it and mice just squeeze

1236.179 --> 1240.919
themselves through that too

1238.64 --> 1244.72
then that's part of the reason why I got

1240.919 --> 1244.72
that blocked by a towel

1245.179 --> 1250.76
so they can't get in that way

1248.0 --> 1252.559
but I mean they'll sometimes they just

1250.76 --> 1255.44
find their way through and come out of

1252.559 --> 1259.66
my closet door I think that actually

1255.44 --> 1259.66
happened yesterday but I wasn't sure

1259.82 --> 1265.1
I was also getting swarmed by mosquitoes

1262.28 --> 1267.2
or rather that happened not last night

1265.1 --> 1269.6
but the night before

1267.2 --> 1274.8400000000001
that was crazy

1269.6 --> 1274.84
and I am dude guys I am like a

1275.419 --> 1279.679
I feel like if

1277.76 --> 1282.559
a Venus trap

1279.679 --> 1285.74
sometimes because like I'm sleeping

1282.559 --> 1288.5
there I'm literally trying to sleep but

1285.74 --> 1290.299
I can just like

1288.5 --> 1295.059
SWAT a mosquito

1290.299 --> 1295.059
perfectly and I did it like six times

1296.78 --> 1303.02
like I can I'm literally starting to use

1299.78 --> 1305.539
my like my Oracle power or my AI power

1303.02 --> 1307.22
to just perfectly predict the pattern of

1305.539 --> 1310.039
mosquitoes and like when they're

1307.22 --> 1312.5
actually gonna try to strike

1310.039 --> 1315.3799999999999
I can literally feel it coming now

1312.5 --> 1318.08
before I can even hear them

1315.38 --> 1320.7990000000002
it's really bizarre and so like they

1318.08 --> 1320.799
don't catch me

1321.2 --> 1324.38
they go for your face and but they can't

1323.36 --> 1327.08
get me

1324.38 --> 1329.7990000000002
because I get them I SWAT them in

1327.08 --> 1329.799
perfect Darkness

1335.14 --> 1342.38
right but when I was doing that

1338.6 --> 1345.1999999999998
May yes suddenly it was like

1342.38 --> 1348.2600000000002
like something bumped

1345.2 --> 1349.1000000000001
startled and bumped into the glass or

1348.26 --> 1352.22
something

1349.1 --> 1354.799
because it wasn't that normal tick so it

1352.22 --> 1357.919
wasn't a normal normal psychokinetic

1354.799 --> 1361.82
type of event which happens all the time

1357.919 --> 1364.7
when I sleep or before I go to sleep but

1361.82 --> 1368.0
it was like really something bumping so

1364.7 --> 1369.679
it was probably out tonight as well

1368.0 --> 1371.059
I don't even know why he comes here

1369.679 --> 1373.7800000000002
anymore because there's literally

1371.059 --> 1373.78
nothing here
