6.16 --> 36.5
[Music]

38.96 --> 42.879
good

40.16 --> 44.879
morning welcome to flat earth early bird

42.879 --> 47.12
number 667

44.879 --> 48.879
i'm your host arwyn and before we start

47.12 --> 51.12
the show please don't forget to share it

51.12 --> 54.48
haven't already subscribe to my channel

52.96 --> 55.92
and hit the bell notification so you

54.48 --> 58.07899999999999
know when i'm going live

55.92 --> 59.120000000000005
which is normally 2 pm amsterdam time

58.079 --> 61.359
every day

59.12 --> 62.718999999999994
please also do support me through paypal

61.359 --> 64.479
patreon the super chat and the

62.719 --> 67.84
membership system join button

64.479 --> 67.84
that'd be much appreciated

69.28 --> 75.36
yeah sorry i'm starting late

72.32 --> 75.36
it's very busy

75.439 --> 80.79899999999999
i'll explain but anyway the weather

77.759 --> 84.88
today again is just

80.799 --> 86.0
amazing it's very similar to yesterday

84.88 --> 88.72
except now there is

86.0 --> 89.119
no wind there's barely any wind and it's

88.72 --> 92.479
just

89.119 --> 92.479
really nice and warm

93.68 --> 99.04
it's amazing just no trace of anything

97.2 --> 101.60000000000001
in the sky

99.04 --> 102.399
ah there's a little plane flying over

101.6 --> 105.36
there

102.399 --> 105.36
probably can't see it

106.64 --> 110.479
it's almost yeah

111.36 --> 114.96
and yeah there's noise out there because

114.0 --> 119.04
of

114.96 --> 119.03999999999999
road works again i think they're

119.439 --> 122.96
paving special new parking places there

122.079 --> 125.67999999999999
by the road

122.96 --> 125.67999999999999
something like that

126.32 --> 131.039
so yeah hello everyone

131.84 --> 138.72
amanda young who's first in chat roger

134.959 --> 141.36
ajm good servant parker

138.72 --> 142.8
yeah good to see you again sorry

141.36 --> 146.48000000000002
starting a little bit late

142.8 --> 147.68
it's just busy it was a pretty late

146.48 --> 152.319
night

147.68 --> 155.28
it got up not too late but still uh yeah

152.319 --> 156.39999999999998
my money or at least some of the money

155.28 --> 160.72
got in

156.4 --> 164.72
and i my package that i ordered

160.72 --> 168.08
from the infowars store had arrived

164.72 --> 170.08
two days ago and yeah now i finally had

168.08 --> 171.12
the money to get that so i i just had to

170.08 --> 174.0
get it because

171.12 --> 175.76
i couldn't really wait much longer i

174.0 --> 177.84
really wanted it

175.76 --> 180.48
survival x too i've been waiting for

177.84 --> 185.36
this for four months now

180.48 --> 188.879
and also yeah a long cleanse

185.36 --> 192.64000000000001
and yeah tried some out

188.879 --> 192.64
and that really hit the spot

193.76 --> 200.64
that's exactly what i needed

198.56 --> 202.239
and i hope it'll do some good for my jaw

200.64 --> 205.44
as well

202.239 --> 207.68
last time it helped a lot when i was

205.44 --> 210.159
using iodine it barely had any issues

207.68 --> 214.48000000000002
with my jaw so

210.159 --> 218.48
anyway i got that uh

214.48 --> 226.56
and also i got a gusto energy drink

218.48 --> 229.44
for change no coffee

226.56 --> 232.159
didn't have coffee yesterday not having

229.44 --> 232.159
coffee today

232.319 --> 236.72
but i am trying this for a moment and of

235.439 --> 241.84
course i also got

236.72 --> 241.84
green tea pour it though

246.64 --> 252.64
coffee is great well not for me

250.319 --> 254.72
i do miss it though i like the taste of

252.64 --> 257.12
coffee i like having a cup of coffee in

254.72 --> 258.88
the morning the problem is though it's

257.12 --> 261.199
at least right now it's just not good

258.88 --> 261.199
for me

262.16 --> 265.52000000000004
because just from two days drinking

264.72 --> 268.56
coffee again

265.52 --> 272.479
like major major like

268.56 --> 274.88
pain in my jaw and now it's

272.479 --> 276.32
already going away again after one day

274.88 --> 278.0
of non-coffee

276.32 --> 280.56
so i'm just gonna have to keep that up

278.0 --> 281.28
for a while until that situation is just

280.56 --> 284.88
restored

281.28 --> 288.08
fully and then we'll see

284.88 --> 289.919
or maybe it's no more coffee for me ever

288.08 --> 292.24
because every time it's gonna hurt i

289.919 --> 292.24
don't know

292.88 --> 295.28
anyway

302.08 --> 308.84
steroids coffee what

305.68 --> 310.639
i wouldn't do that if i were you a good

308.84 --> 313.75899999999996
servant

310.639 --> 314.72
anyway yeah yes this episode was pretty

313.759 --> 317.039
good

314.72 --> 319.44000000000005
it did get a lot of attention expectedly

317.039 --> 322.479
everybody was as i predicted squirting

319.44 --> 324.56
over that 666 got all kinds of trolls

322.479 --> 325.919
that didn't even watch my hangout they

324.56 --> 328.479
were just

325.919 --> 330.24
just looking at the 666 and getting all

328.479 --> 334.0
squirty over it

330.24 --> 334.0
right uh

334.8 --> 340.08
holy [ __ ] i completely forgot to make

337.039 --> 340.08
notes yesterday just

350.84 --> 356.15999999999997
completely

352.8 --> 356.16
all right let me try to

358.8 --> 364.16
back engineer that uh once again

365.84 --> 369.28
right yeah the flatter

369.6 --> 380.319
debate rerun it was pretty good

373.28 --> 382.4
it's a very good episode

380.319 --> 383.68
did i watch the glow busters episode

382.4 --> 387.28
about the ether

383.68 --> 387.28000000000003
no no i did not

388.08 --> 397.75899999999996
because it was luminiferous ether then

392.84 --> 397.75899999999996
yeah it's gonna be messy

397.84 --> 402.15999999999997
i i don't like messi i don't like messy

401.12 --> 405.28000000000003
fantasizing

402.16 --> 407.68
at all now if he wants

405.28 --> 409.28
if they want to do that that's just fine

407.68 --> 412.72
and then you let them do that

409.28 --> 415.52
i'll focus on my own

412.72 --> 415.52000000000004
conceptions

418.479 --> 423.12
but yeah was there anything noteworthy

420.56 --> 426.16
to share about it

423.12 --> 426.16
that stood out to you

435.44 --> 440.88
i did watch like the mummy yesterday the

438.08 --> 443.44
movie it was a long time ago

440.88 --> 444.56
interesting little details in there that

443.44 --> 446.96
i already knew

444.56 --> 448.0
but i like was good to go over them

446.96 --> 450.15999999999997
again

448.0 --> 451.36
it's interesting it's an interesting

450.16 --> 454.88000000000005
movie and it's a

451.36 --> 456.40000000000003
pretty decent action movie too or action

454.88 --> 459.599
adventure

456.4 --> 462.71999999999997
it's very much like indiana jones many

459.599 --> 465.12
ways it's obviously like

462.72 --> 468.40000000000003
going roughly the same direction same

465.12 --> 468.4
time period and all that

471.52 --> 474.96
claims he measured the ether with this

474.4 --> 478.08
ring

474.96 --> 482.56
gyroscope oh god

478.08 --> 482.56
of course he did of course

482.96 --> 489.52
whatever that is you know if you're

486.479 --> 492.87899999999996
yeah what why what did it cost

489.52 --> 495.84
why how did he elect

492.879 --> 499.28000000000003
the luminiferous ether cause the

495.84 --> 499.28
pendulum to rotate

500.96 --> 505.44
you know there is a rotation you could

503.28 --> 506.0
say that is the luminiferous ether it

505.44 --> 507.759
rotates

506.0 --> 509.44
just like the heavenly body yeah you

507.759 --> 512.0
could definitely say that

509.44 --> 514.64
but how is it causing it exactly how is

512.0 --> 516.56
he very manipulating that thing

514.64 --> 518.959
how can you prevent the ring laser

516.56 --> 521.1199999999999
gyroscope from rotating

518.959 --> 523.1999999999999
because you have to very manipulate

521.12 --> 524.8
something in order to actually establish

523.2 --> 528.08
a causal relationship

524.8 --> 529.68
first right otherwise it's just going to

528.08 --> 531.279
be the same like gravity it's just going

529.68 --> 533.8389999999999
to be like hey there is something

531.279 --> 536.16
i'm assuming it's this wait i can't very

533.839 --> 539.519
manipulate it because it's constant

536.16 --> 541.68
well then it's not scientific

539.519 --> 542.8
then you don't know what is actually

541.68 --> 549.519
causing it you're just

542.8 --> 553.4399999999999
calling the phenomenon it

549.519 --> 553.44
yeah it propagates light no it doesn't

555.12 --> 559.44
this is ridiculous it is absolutely

558.399 --> 563.279
ridiculous

559.44 --> 567.7600000000001
the ether is not a light medium

563.279 --> 567.76
light does not require a medium

568.8 --> 577.8389999999999
the medium of light is matter

598.16 --> 604.079
so yeah bad habits

601.839 --> 607.2
it's kind of typical isn't it i heard

604.079 --> 607.1999999999999
that apparently

607.92 --> 618.079
bob and cathy and all that have

611.279 --> 621.279
made up with john and and nathan

618.079 --> 621.76
despite that yeah they're still the yeah

621.279 --> 624.8
then

621.76 --> 626.56
this is the next day pretty much

624.8 --> 628.3199999999999
they're doing an entire show about the

626.56 --> 631.5999999999999
luminiferous ether

628.32 --> 634.88
so what's the deal there

631.6 --> 637.279
i guess that was not part of the

634.88 --> 639.36
the agreement like hey you guys got to

637.279 --> 642.16
be correct i guess that wasn't part of

639.36 --> 644.839
the agreement then

642.16 --> 647.519
if they just did an entire hangout about

644.839 --> 650.24
that

647.519 --> 650.24
i don't know man

650.8 --> 654.8
i i don't really care too much you know

653.12 --> 658.399
it's nice that they're

654.8 --> 660.3199999999999
acting nice but yeah things that are

658.399 --> 662.32
annoying me are still going to annoy me

660.32 --> 664.72
if they keep on doing that

662.32 --> 666.88
i could look i will be me i will always

664.72 --> 669.2
be me

666.88 --> 670.079
they may have had an attitude towards me

669.2 --> 674.32
because

670.079 --> 678.3199999999999
i echo nathan and john's

674.32 --> 681.36
arguments and i'm not adapting

678.32 --> 683.7600000000001
socially to what they like

681.36 --> 685.04
but that's not because of that it's

683.76 --> 689.279
basically

685.04 --> 692.3199999999999
because that's the way i am

689.279 --> 696.32
it is always the way i was

692.32 --> 699.0400000000001
except now i have

696.32 --> 700.24
two people which happen to be nathan and

699.04 --> 704.079
kiwi

700.24 --> 706.64
which i kind of know will have my back

704.079 --> 708.3199999999999
if i'm just being honest about that and

706.64 --> 711.12
basically pushing that a little not

708.32 --> 712.24
not that i'm gonna attack anyone

711.12 --> 715.6
verbally

712.24 --> 717.6800000000001
in a high level but i will confront and

715.6 --> 718.639
that's why i did it i did it because i

717.68 --> 722.8
trusted

718.639 --> 725.92
my arguments that nathan and john

722.8 --> 728.399
echoed even though i don't fully agree

725.92 --> 730.079
for example with john's light conception

728.399 --> 733.519
in the first place right

730.079 --> 737.1999999999999
so i don't agree but i definitely agree

733.519 --> 737.2
that there is no such thing as a

737.6 --> 744.399
an ether medium for light

740.959 --> 747.5189999999999
which would have to be because light

744.399 --> 749.92
is wave and it requires a special medium

747.519 --> 753.279
and that medium apparently can't be air

749.92 --> 754.4799999999999
blah blah blah but yeah if they're now

753.279 --> 756.639
going to be nice

754.48 --> 758.0
that's nice that's great i'm just going

756.639 --> 761.36
to be still me

758.0 --> 763.2
do what i always do in the way that i do

761.36 --> 765.04
it

763.2 --> 766.72
so i'm going to be critical i'm going to

765.04 --> 770.399
be silly going to be

766.72 --> 775.0400000000001
satirical towards people

770.399 --> 775.04
and yeah that's not going to change

776.32 --> 780.399
quantum foam what

781.279 --> 787.8389999999999
yeah by the way hello rasta hat

794.32 --> 801.839
no no she no he doesn't

802.0 --> 807.92
the 15 degree deviation of the

805.04 --> 811.92
ring laser gyroscope is not a proof of

807.92 --> 811.92
earth rotation not even remotely

812.48 --> 818.32
you know why because if it was then a

815.68 --> 819.279
physical gyroscope would have the exact

818.32 --> 822.399
same

819.279 --> 825.04
deviation and it did not also the

822.399 --> 828.16
specific 15 degree deviation

825.04 --> 831.4399999999999
is not parallel to the

828.16 --> 834.88
presupposed axis of

831.44 --> 838.8000000000001
globe earth which it would have to be

834.88 --> 842.32
if it is deviating due to earth spin

838.8 --> 845.8389999999999
because the location on that globe earth

842.32 --> 847.7600000000001
matters for what direction the gyroscope

845.839 --> 849.0400000000001
any gyroscope would be spinning and i'm

847.76 --> 852.16
pretty sure that the

849.04 --> 855.76
ring laser gyroscope spins

852.16 --> 859.04
perfectly perpendicular to the location

855.76 --> 861.12
perpendicular to flat as it were well

859.04 --> 863.12
that was in america well that makes no

861.12 --> 865.199
damn sense because the america is not

863.12 --> 868.5600000000001
the north pole of earth

865.199 --> 871.92
of globe earth right so it's

868.56 --> 872.88
completely nonsensical to even assume

871.92 --> 876.8
it's earth

872.88 --> 876.8
rotation based in any way

879.519 --> 882.72
what is it aligned with well that's a

881.04 --> 886.399
bit of a mystery isn't it

882.72 --> 887.0400000000001
my suspicion is that it is tapping into

886.399 --> 890.32
the same

887.04 --> 892.16
influence somehow because

890.32 --> 893.9200000000001
there is light involved it's tapping

892.16 --> 897.4399999999999
into the same

893.92 --> 900.959
light influence that is probably

897.44 --> 902.5600000000001
causing the heavenly bodies specifically

900.959 --> 906.079
the stars to rotate

902.56 --> 908.2399999999999
15 degrees an hour i think that is what

906.079 --> 910.6389999999999
it is tapping into and then

908.24 --> 912.32
because those things those lights are

910.639 --> 914.5600000000001
holographic in nature

912.32 --> 916.24
obviously to me other people have a

914.56 --> 917.5999999999999
little bit more trouble with realizing

916.24 --> 920.72
that

917.6 --> 924.0790000000001
then the

920.72 --> 925.519
exact axis of the rotation doesn't even

924.079 --> 928.16
matter that much

925.519 --> 928.8
because it's just tapping into like a

928.16 --> 931.519
spinning

928.8 --> 933.8389999999999
effect and that could doesn't really

931.519 --> 937.6
matter

933.839 --> 939.44
it's just a spinning effect of

937.6 --> 942.5600000000001
the light influence of the light

939.44 --> 945.9200000000001
manifestation influence out there

942.56 --> 949.1199999999999
what causes the heavenly lights to

945.92 --> 952.56
manifest and spin

949.12 --> 956.32
but that's electrics it's not light

952.56 --> 959.199
medium base there is no light medium

956.32 --> 959.6
that is doing that because light doesn't

959.199 --> 962.4799999999999
need

959.6 --> 963.0400000000001
such a medium to do what it does what

962.48 --> 965.1990000000001
light

963.04 --> 967.04
does need in every single instance

965.199 --> 969.5999999999999
though is energy

967.04 --> 971.68
to feed its manifestation whether it is

969.6 --> 973.12
holographic or coming from a physical

971.68 --> 974.7199999999999
literal source

973.12 --> 976.88
doesn't matter concerning that there

974.72 --> 978.72
needs to be energy feeding into it

976.88 --> 980.8
well the only energy that i could think

978.72 --> 984.24
of that could be doing that in any way

980.8 --> 987.04
is electric and that's where the

984.24 --> 988.88
electric ether comes in not a

987.04 --> 991.04
luminiferous ether

988.88 --> 992.32
there is no such thing but an electric

991.04 --> 995.68
ether the same

992.32 --> 998.88
thing that tesla dealt with focused on

995.68 --> 999.7589999999999
oh yeah better damn well believe that is

998.88 --> 1003.4399999999999
there

999.759 --> 1005.36
it is there is electricity in the air

1003.44 --> 1010.1600000000001
and you can't tap into it you can

1005.36 --> 1013.1990000000001
do all kinds of things with that

1010.16 --> 1016.3199999999999
so the electricity is there

1013.199 --> 1016.3199999999999
the way that it is

1016.72 --> 1021.6800000000001
that's already provable now it's up to

1019.12 --> 1025.679
us to figure out how

1021.68 --> 1029.36
and what it is all influencing

1025.679 --> 1031.679
so that's there

1029.36 --> 1032.9589999999998
i think that's probably the cause how do

1031.679 --> 1035.199
i prove it i don't know

1032.959 --> 1036.88
not yet but it is at least it can be

1035.199 --> 1040.4
established that it's there

1036.88 --> 1040.4
that there is this energy there

1046.64 --> 1050.88
right so that's that's what all that i

1049.12 --> 1052.4799999999998
have to say about that and that's also

1050.88 --> 1054.64
why i didn't watch the show because i

1052.48 --> 1058.0
already know exactly

1054.64 --> 1060.72
i know it luminiferous ether talk to me

1058.0 --> 1063.84
is just like global conceptions it is

1060.72 --> 1067.2
it's exactly the same to me

1063.84 --> 1069.6
it's just an error and then people

1067.2 --> 1070.4
basically counter-argue it and then you

1069.6 --> 1073.1999999999998
ignore it

1070.4 --> 1074.96
and then you continue saying the same

1073.2 --> 1077.919
things over and over again drawing the

1074.96 --> 1080.4
same conclusions ignoring all rebuttals

1077.919 --> 1081.6000000000001
and then even expanding on it a little

1080.4 --> 1084.0800000000002
if you can

1081.6 --> 1086.08
thought up something and that's what

1084.08 --> 1094.96
they typically do

1086.08 --> 1098.32
and i'm not interested in that

1094.96 --> 1101.3600000000001
could be it is dude this whole

1098.32 --> 1104.3999999999999
ether situation that's been

1101.36 --> 1107.4399999999998
out here for at least

1104.4 --> 1109.2800000000002
two years now for

1107.44 --> 1110.88
almost two years one at least one a half

1109.28 --> 1113.12
year it's been

1110.88 --> 1114.4
in the debates pretty much since qe came

1113.12 --> 1118.32
in

1114.4 --> 1121.6000000000001
became a part of it that was addressed

1118.32 --> 1122.0
extensively multiple times many many

1121.6 --> 1124.48
many

1122.0 --> 1124.48
times

1126.08 --> 1130.08
and that's a long time ago so that's

1128.4 --> 1132.0800000000002
very telling it's been

1130.08 --> 1134.3999999999999
ignored because hey they're still going

1132.08 --> 1137.84
with it ignoring rebuttals

1134.4 --> 1137.8400000000001
ignoring arguments at it

1146.08 --> 1153.76
and i'm not angry at them for doing that

1149.6 --> 1155.76
it just makes me lose interest

1153.76 --> 1157.6
because yeah it's already very

1155.76 --> 1165.84
predictable what it's like i've already

1157.6 --> 1165.84
sized up the concept

1176.84 --> 1181.52
oy anyway

1182.0 --> 1187.919
what cheese hologram what

1186.4 --> 1193.8400000000001
that's a funny name that's a good one

1187.919 --> 1193.8400000000001
for the moon right

1210.4 --> 1217.1200000000001
uh rob h that's that's

1214.159 --> 1217.7600000000002
absolutely wrong i don't know where you

1217.12 --> 1222.4799999999998
got that

1217.76 --> 1222.48
but that doesn't make any freaking sense

1222.799 --> 1229.6
if you believe in a photon photon then

1226.799 --> 1230.96
that's you don't need the ether you

1229.6 --> 1234.559
don't need

1230.96 --> 1238.559
a light medium for a photon at all

1234.559 --> 1240.3999999999999
not that i think that light is a photon

1238.559 --> 1242.48
opinion yeah but it doesn't matter if

1240.4 --> 1244.48
it's an opinion it makes no logical

1242.48 --> 1247.679
sense you don't understand

1244.48 --> 1250.4
the concept of the photon if you're

1247.679 --> 1250.4
stating that

1250.64 --> 1255.76
it makes no sense i'm trying to help you

1253.76 --> 1256.32
out here you're making a big mistake

1255.76 --> 1263.84
it's just

1256.32 --> 1263.84
it makes no sense saying that

1266.24 --> 1270.48
unless you're saying the electric ether

1268.4 --> 1275.039
but that's not directly

1270.48 --> 1277.76
related to how light behaves

1275.039 --> 1280.64
yeah in a in a universal sense like

1277.76 --> 1280.64
every single time

1284.72 --> 1287.84
it only reveals itself with the ring

1286.48 --> 1291.84
laser gyroscope

1287.84 --> 1291.84
so far

1303.44 --> 1305.8400000000001
what

1316.84 --> 1322.9599999999998
how doesn't make any sense

1319.679 --> 1323.76
how how is this supposed luminous ether

1322.96 --> 1327.52
right

1323.76 --> 1331.52
the medium for light to propel in

1327.52 --> 1335.44
how is that necessary for anything

1331.52 --> 1335.44
how does it do anything

1337.6 --> 1341.9189999999999
there's you guys have all been

1340.4 --> 1345.8400000000001
brainwashed

1341.919 --> 1349.1200000000001
you all listened in you drowned in it

1345.84 --> 1352.1589999999999
you let your suspense of disbelief

1349.12 --> 1353.6789999999999
get wide open again you got to be

1352.159 --> 1355.5200000000002
critical of what you're listening and

1353.679 --> 1356.5590000000002
that means that a lot of things are

1355.52 --> 1359.36
going to suck

1356.559 --> 1361.2
it means you're going to be disturbed

1359.36 --> 1363.9189999999999
because constantly people say

1361.2 --> 1366.0
stupid things and are wrong yeah that's

1363.919 --> 1368.5590000000002
annoying

1366.0 --> 1370.08
but you gotta be consistent or you're

1368.559 --> 1375.84
gonna wander off and not

1370.08 --> 1375.84
get you start blabbering nonsense

1382.24 --> 1389.919
there is no ether light medium

1386.4 --> 1393.039
it's not required light doesn't need

1389.919 --> 1394.4
an extra medium to behave the way it

1393.039 --> 1397.44
does

1394.4 --> 1402.799
that's conceptual there's no proof

1397.44 --> 1405.8400000000001
for that

1402.799 --> 1405.84
hey do your parent

1410.72 --> 1415.1200000000001
come on how many times how many times

1413.52 --> 1420.799
the medium for light

1415.12 --> 1420.799
is matter or the lack thereof

1421.84 --> 1426.559
it travels through matter it does its

1424.0 --> 1428.559
things because of matter it refracts

1426.559 --> 1431.76
because of matter it

1428.559 --> 1434.48
causes diffraction cascade because of

1431.76 --> 1435.279
proximity to matter everything that

1434.48 --> 1438.32
light does

1435.279 --> 1441.52
is because of matter everything

1438.32 --> 1444.3999999999999
so the medium for light is matter

1441.52 --> 1445.12
it's not ether it doesn't need to be

1444.4 --> 1447.279
ether

1445.12 --> 1448.559
ether is a concept there's no proof for

1447.279 --> 1452.32
it and it doesn't

1448.559 --> 1454.72
need to exist can only

1452.32 --> 1456.72
the only reason to conjure it up is

1454.72 --> 1459.84
because you misunderstand what the [ __ ]

1456.72 --> 1459.84
is going on

1489.2 --> 1492.4
yeah a little tiny wumbo

1492.88 --> 1497.1200000000001
yeah i bet you agree with almost all my

1495.039 --> 1499.36
ideas except the ones that

1497.12 --> 1501.84
prove the earth is flat or not a globe

1499.36 --> 1501.84
right

1502.799 --> 1505.84
it doesn't matter i'm not going to poke

1504.88 --> 1508.159
you about that

1505.84 --> 1510.24
glad you agree because it is sensible

1508.159 --> 1511.8400000000001
it's the only sensible conclusion and i

1510.24 --> 1513.84
don't know why people

1511.84 --> 1516.48
have to conjure up this luminiferous

1513.84 --> 1519.579
ether constantly

1516.48 --> 1519.579
[Music]

1527.2 --> 1533.919
oh really wasting your time was i

1530.4 --> 1536.24
rob h oh i'm sorry you're addicted to a

1533.919 --> 1537.6000000000001
concept that doesn't exist and it's very

1536.24 --> 1542.0
much equatable to

1537.6 --> 1544.6399999999999
gravity right it's a reification fallacy

1542.0 --> 1546.64
luminiferous ether is a reification

1544.64 --> 1549.919
fallacy

1546.64 --> 1553.279
and i'm very close to declaring it

1549.919 --> 1554.64
an aberration because it is highly

1553.279 --> 1558.72
suggestible to be

1554.64 --> 1561.279
there from a certain vantage point

1558.72 --> 1563.6000000000001
a way of seeing things figuring out

1561.279 --> 1566.96
things then the luminesce first ether is

1563.6 --> 1570.3999999999999
a very easy concept to fall

1566.96 --> 1572.96
for for that

1570.4 --> 1574.88
but it doesn't actually exist and like

1572.96 --> 1575.3600000000001
that it's just like gravity all these

1574.88 --> 1578.4
different

1575.36 --> 1581.4399999999998
elements misinterpreted that are

1578.4 --> 1583.76
all attributable to other things

1581.44 --> 1585.76
even though unlike with gravity the

1583.76 --> 1588.48
luminiferous ether

1585.76 --> 1590.24
elements and traits are not all easily

1588.48 --> 1593.919
figured out

1590.24 --> 1593.919
but they could be i'm sure of it

1595.919 --> 1599.1200000000001
but the fundamental fact remains is that

1598.64 --> 1601.039
it is

1599.12 --> 1602.559
conjured up from a philosophical

1601.039 --> 1607.36
necessity

1602.559 --> 1610.72
assuming light is a wave which it isn't

1607.36 --> 1613.1999999999998
it's not a wave and it's not

1610.72 --> 1614.72
a particle it is something else light is

1613.2 --> 1618.4
pretty damn unique

1614.72 --> 1622.0
at it like

1618.4 --> 1626.0800000000002
holographic presence

1622.0 --> 1629.6
virtual visual holographics only

1626.08 --> 1632.48
only exists with light

1629.6 --> 1635.1999999999998
it's the only thing it is even possible

1632.48 --> 1637.279
with to have that

1635.2 --> 1638.799
right well that should already tell you

1637.279 --> 1641.84
something it's pretty it's a

1638.799 --> 1641.84
pretty unique thing

1645.76 --> 1650.0
so i think that the wave particle

1648.48 --> 1655.84
duality

1650.0 --> 1655.84
concerning light is a false dichotomy

1661.919 --> 1666.3990000000001
yeah adamican it's good to know that you

1664.48 --> 1668.52
were in there at least

1666.399 --> 1671.52
it is just these ether these

1668.52 --> 1671.52
etherealists

1677.039 --> 1686.72
i'm very glad that i chose esoteric

1683.36 --> 1686.7199999999998
instead of ethereal

1688.48 --> 1694.559
when it comes to my conception of

1690.399 --> 1694.559
christianity because both words kind of

1694.64 --> 1698.159
are like in that direction

1698.72 --> 1702.48
rough yeah would you say colloquially

1700.88 --> 1705.919
like the feeling of it

1702.48 --> 1708.48
but yeah ether is just becoming a giant

1705.919 --> 1708.48
nuisance

1709.679 --> 1713.1200000000001
because it isn't it's the next

1711.279 --> 1716.48
aberration it's like oh well

1713.12 --> 1718.559
we can't have our globe related

1716.48 --> 1721.76
conceptions anymore

1718.559 --> 1724.32
well we are not going to accept

1721.76 --> 1725.679
that we can't dwell on fantastical

1724.32 --> 1728.799
unprovable things

1725.679 --> 1731.3600000000001
so here is the luminiferous ether now

1728.799 --> 1732.08
let's all squirt and fantasize about

1731.36 --> 1734.4799999999998
that

1732.08 --> 1735.52
for as long as we can waste all our time

1734.48 --> 1737.84
and energy on that

1735.52 --> 1738.96
on an unprovable concept fantasizing

1737.84 --> 1742.08
about oh wow

1738.96 --> 1745.44
this and go way back to all the old

1742.08 --> 1748.48
fantasies again of ooh

1745.44 --> 1751.679
it's it's dreaming

1748.48 --> 1753.919
it's dreaming addiction and there's

1751.679 --> 1758.24
nothing more suitable for dreaming

1753.919 --> 1760.0
addiction than aberrations

1758.24 --> 1763.1200000000001
because aberrations are highly

1760.0 --> 1766.96
suggestive unprovable things

1763.12 --> 1771.6
yeah that's dream material if you if you

1766.96 --> 1771.6000000000001
if if there is any you know

1778.24 --> 1782.48
yes it is a concept no it's not been

1780.48 --> 1784.72
proven yeah but it's not just that

1782.48 --> 1786.799
it's unprovable you can't very

1784.72 --> 1789.76
manipulate it

1786.799 --> 1791.76
just like gravity you can very

1789.76 --> 1792.72
manipulate relative density though which

1791.76 --> 1796.0
makes that

1792.72 --> 1797.76
the real thing well the ether cannot be

1796.0 --> 1800.96
varied and manipulated

1797.76 --> 1803.12
one has to then conclude seeming

1800.96 --> 1805.679
that this type of process happens more

1803.12 --> 1808.08
often in science and physics

1805.679 --> 1808.96
that it too is an aberration and there's

1808.08 --> 1812.1589999999999
something that

1808.96 --> 1815.3600000000001
should be able to explain

1812.159 --> 1816.72
the separate phenomenon tied into its

1815.36 --> 1820.08
conception

1816.72 --> 1823.039
eventually which will not be ether

1820.08 --> 1824.24
because it can't be ether doesn't make

1823.039 --> 1826.1589999999999
any sense

1824.24 --> 1829.039
the only ether that exists is the

1826.159 --> 1832.3990000000001
electrical ether and has nothing to do

1829.039 --> 1836.8799999999999
with how light procreates

1832.399 --> 1839.9189999999999
may be tied into how it manifests

1836.88 --> 1842.48
like how is it spawned the natural

1839.919 --> 1845.8400000000001
lights that is the celestial lights

1842.48 --> 1849.52
and yeah that's the only ether that i'm

1845.84 --> 1850.0
willing to accept as a vantage point for

1849.52 --> 1853.84
further

1850.0 --> 1853.84
explorations of how things work in this

1862.84 --> 1865.84
realm

1867.44 --> 1873.519
how does crow hey mr jones is back

1871.12 --> 1874.399
yeah there's a flat earth debates in 15

1873.519 --> 1876.84
minutes

1874.399 --> 1879.4399999999998
would be interesting to see you join

1876.84 --> 1881.279
that

1879.44 --> 1883.3600000000001
yeah why do things accelerate towards

1881.279 --> 1885.2
the ground at a constant rate well they

1883.36 --> 1889.039
don't

1885.2 --> 1889.519
right they don't do you understand mr

1889.039 --> 1892.8799999999999
jones

1889.519 --> 1895.36
they do not do that things

1892.88 --> 1896.64
do not accelerate towards the ground at

1895.36 --> 1901.039
a constant rate

1896.64 --> 1904.3200000000002
they don't it never does

1901.039 --> 1904.96
it's because things accelerate at

1904.32 --> 1907.2
different

1904.96 --> 1908.88
rates depending on the medium and the

1907.2 --> 1911.279
density of the object

1908.88 --> 1913.6000000000001
and it even accelerates in the other

1911.279 --> 1917.399
direction

1913.6 --> 1919.279
so no it doesn't it's relative density

1917.399 --> 1921.6
disequilibrium force

1919.279 --> 1922.96
because of the medium and the object's

1921.6 --> 1925.76
differential

1922.96 --> 1926.559
density differential between them that

1925.76 --> 1929.2
creates

1926.559 --> 1930.24
the disequilibrium force and it will be

1929.2 --> 1933.679
in

1930.24 --> 1937.36
either direction depending

1933.679 --> 1939.6000000000001
on whether the object is more dense or

1937.36 --> 1942.32
less dense than its medium

1939.6 --> 1943.76
and if it's equally dense then it will

1942.32 --> 1946.399
not

1943.76 --> 1948.0
cause a relative density this

1946.399 --> 1951.1999999999998
equilibrium force and it will stay

1948.0 --> 1953.279
in its place so there is

1951.2 --> 1955.919
no constant acceleration things that

1953.279 --> 1960.0
stay in its place

1955.919 --> 1960.0
are not accelerating they are not moving

1961.039 --> 1965.679
you might be extra dimension you might

1963.36 --> 1967.12
imagine extra dimensional movement like

1965.679 --> 1968.799
einstein did

1967.12 --> 1977.279
that doesn't mean they are actually

1968.799 --> 1979.279
moving that's just conceptualization

1977.279 --> 1980.399
yeah drop something in a vacuum you know

1979.279 --> 1982.48
why you know why

1980.399 --> 1983.84
a balloon filled with helium drops in a

1982.48 --> 1986.559
vacuum

1983.84 --> 1987.6
because the balloon and the helium

1986.559 --> 1990.32
combined

1987.6 --> 1991.36
are denser than the medium it's in which

1990.32 --> 1993.9189999999999
is a vacuum

1991.36 --> 1995.039
which is a lower density than regular

1993.919 --> 1999.039
air pressure

1995.039 --> 2001.679
so that's why it falls down that's right

1999.039 --> 2005.84
it's not gravity it's because it's

2001.679 --> 2005.8400000000001
denser than the medium

2007.519 --> 2021.519
do you understand

2019.679 --> 2024.0800000000002
yeah drop something in a vacuum why

2021.519 --> 2027.519
don't you drop

2024.08 --> 2029.519
an open yeah put a gas canister in a

2027.519 --> 2031.039
vacuum chamber and then open it up see

2029.519 --> 2033.039
what happens

2031.039 --> 2035.679
is it gonna go down go boom boom that

2033.039 --> 2037.519
gas or is it gonna fill the entire gas

2035.679 --> 2040.64
chamber

2037.519 --> 2042.64
is it gonna fill the vacuum chamber

2040.64 --> 2044.3200000000002
and then it might be sucked off again

2042.64 --> 2046.7990000000002
because the vacuum chamber might still

2044.32 --> 2048.399
be pumping it out

2046.799 --> 2050.639
but it's not going to go down go boom

2048.399 --> 2050.6389999999997
boom

2051.919 --> 2060.0
it's going to go in all directions gas

2053.679 --> 2061.76
goes in all directions

2060.0 --> 2063.28
you listening mr jones or is this the

2061.76 --> 2065.0400000000004
last time you're gonna be in my chat

2063.28 --> 2067.599
because i just explained it to you

2065.04 --> 2069.679
three times and now you're asking me why

2067.599 --> 2073.3590000000004
down

2069.679 --> 2076.639
i told you why it always

2073.359 --> 2080.48
fall down because a vacuum

2076.639 --> 2082.2400000000002
is always less dense than the object

2080.48 --> 2089.839
including a helium balloon

2082.24 --> 2089.839
are you hearing me mr jones

2100.94 --> 2103.9990000000003
[Music]

2106.88 --> 2112.6400000000003
that's i never said vacuum suck

2110.64 --> 2114.8799999999997
i said the gas will expand in all

2112.64 --> 2116.72
directions if it can

2114.88 --> 2119.2000000000003
if it has maneuvering room if it's not

2116.72 --> 2121.68
locked in by a balloon

2119.2 --> 2123.2799999999997
that can withstand the inner pressure

2121.68 --> 2126.72
versus

2123.28 --> 2128.8390000000004
the vacuum outside because the pressure

2126.72 --> 2132.64
differential will be pretty

2128.839 --> 2135.44
severe eventually with a vacuum

2132.64 --> 2137.2
the object that's containing the gas the

2135.44 --> 2139.359
gas container has got to be strong

2137.2 --> 2142.3199999999997
enough

2139.359 --> 2144.16
but it's always going to fall down in a

2142.32 --> 2147.2000000000003
vacuum because the vacuum is

2144.16 --> 2148.64
always going to be less dense than the

2147.2 --> 2152.7999999999997
object

2148.64 --> 2154.839
it's as simple as that no density is not

2152.8 --> 2157.28
a force that's right but the density

2154.839 --> 2158.48
disequilibrium between an object and the

2157.28 --> 2162.0
medium

2158.48 --> 2165.359
that does absolutely provably so

2162.0 --> 2168.8
variably and manipulatable cause

2165.359 --> 2170.4
a force and there's nothing that you can

2168.8 --> 2172.8
do to disprove that

2170.4 --> 2174.32
but you can try in any way you can

2172.8 --> 2177.119
conceive you will always

2174.32 --> 2177.52
fail because it's proven its scientific

2177.119 --> 2180.7200000000003
fact

2177.52 --> 2184.24
relative density theory is scientific

2180.72 --> 2186.24
fact and i've mastered it i can explain

2184.24 --> 2188.64
every conceivable angle every

2186.24 --> 2191.2
conceivable setup of the experiment with

2188.64 --> 2194.16
every detail that would be a variable

2191.2 --> 2195.4399999999996
within the concept within the setup of

2194.16 --> 2198.839
the experiment

2195.44 --> 2203.359
relative density this equilibrium force

2198.839 --> 2207.839
is what gravity is trying to reify

2203.359 --> 2207.839
into its false conception

2208.16 --> 2211.839
relative density disequilibrium causes

2210.48 --> 2215.76
the displacement

2211.839 --> 2219.68
it causes the pressure

2215.76 --> 2219.6800000000003
and that's it that's proven fact

2227.04 --> 2231.48
you're not listening it's not relative

2230.24 --> 2233.9199999999996
[Music]

2231.48 --> 2235.52
delibrium maybe you should learn how to

2233.92 --> 2238.8
spell before you're gonna

2235.52 --> 2242.32
assert supposed scientific facts

2238.8 --> 2245.92
right which you're not by the way

2242.32 --> 2249.2000000000003
relative density relative density

2245.92 --> 2253.04
this equilibrium is definitely a

2249.2 --> 2256.48
force it causes the force

2253.04 --> 2260.72
provably so there's this disequilibrium

2256.48 --> 2261.599
if there is a a big differential between

2260.72 --> 2264.9599999999996
the object

2261.599 --> 2268.7200000000003
and the medium's density then force will

2264.96 --> 2269.359
come into being in an accelerated

2268.72 --> 2272.7999999999997
fashion

2269.359 --> 2276.16
as forces do unless it is

2272.8 --> 2278.1600000000003
obstructed from moving despite being

2276.16 --> 2280.0
in this equilibrium with the medium and

2278.16 --> 2282.24
then instead it will

2280.0 --> 2283.28
exert pressure in the direction that it

2282.24 --> 2286.3199999999997
wants to move

2283.28 --> 2287.52
at because of the disequilibrium and

2286.32 --> 2290.96
that pressure

2287.52 --> 2295.119
if if the setting is within a standard

2290.96 --> 2298.88
air pressure medium that can then be

2295.119 --> 2299.359
measured as weight the standardized

2298.88 --> 2301.119
weight

2299.359 --> 2303.359
which is relative density this

2301.119 --> 2303.839
equilibrium within a specific medium of

2303.359 --> 2307.2
air

2303.839 --> 2309.68
that is weight it's not because of

2307.2 --> 2313.5989999999997
gravity go down go boom boom

2309.68 --> 2316.24
because weight is definitely directly

2313.599 --> 2316.7200000000003
dependent on the medium because air

2316.24 --> 2319.04
weight

2316.72 --> 2320.56
is not the same as water weight which is

2319.04 --> 2323.92
officially a concept

2320.56 --> 2324.4
water weight is another weight why is

2323.92 --> 2327.44
that

2324.4 --> 2330.56
because it's based on relative density

2327.44 --> 2331.68
not on some force called gravity and the

2330.56 --> 2334.7999999999997
same goes for

2331.68 --> 2339.2799999999997
vacuum weight which is in a

2334.8 --> 2343.119
medium of vacuum also based on relative

2339.28 --> 2343.119
density not gravity

2345.839 --> 2352.4
yeah well gravity as per einstein not

2349.599 --> 2353.119
being a force is purely conceptual mumbo

2352.4 --> 2356.2400000000002
jumbo

2353.119 --> 2360.48
that's completely unprovable

2356.24 --> 2360.4799999999996
so it's no use to even draw that in

2364.17 --> 2369.839
[Music]

2366.32 --> 2369.839
i don't have to google

2369.92 --> 2373.6800000000003
google gravity not being a force i'm

2372.4 --> 2376.64
very well aware

2373.68 --> 2378.0789999999997
of the official narrative of gravity and

2376.64 --> 2381.359
indeed it isn't a force

2378.079 --> 2383.8390000000004
it's the spending of space time

2381.359 --> 2385.7599999999998
which takes place in a conceptual medium

2383.839 --> 2386.48
that's never been proven that cannot be

2385.76 --> 2390.88
proven that

2386.48 --> 2393.599
reifies time into a physical dimension

2390.88 --> 2394.48
spatial dimension like thing which it's

2393.599 --> 2397.2000000000003
not it's um

2394.48 --> 2397.839
you can't do that that's impossible you

2397.2 --> 2399.839
can't very

2397.839 --> 2401.68
manipulate time it doesn't exist like

2399.839 --> 2403.839
that and even any

2401.68 --> 2405.839
conception that flows out of the

2403.839 --> 2408.839
supposed bending of space-time causing

2405.839 --> 2410.88
displacement and force in the normal 3d

2408.839 --> 2413.92
realm

2410.88 --> 2417.28
it it doesn't even work people

2413.92 --> 2419.52
can't even explain how that

2417.28 --> 2421.0400000000004
works other than fantastical

2419.52 --> 2422.839
storytelling

2421.04 --> 2424.16
which you can't even prove

2422.839 --> 2429.2
mathematically

2424.16 --> 2431.2
or experimentally it makes no sense

2429.2 --> 2432.72
bending of space-time gravity is

2431.2 --> 2436.48
completely conceptual

2432.72 --> 2440.7999999999997
and it only serves to draw

2436.48 --> 2440.8
away from physical reality

2447.119 --> 2467.839
ah but keep trying though

2452.24 --> 2467.839
mr jones

2470.48 --> 2474.96
gravity only works when you're pissed

2472.64 --> 2474.96
nah

2475.52 --> 2480.4
it never really works it's a reification

2477.76 --> 2483.92
fallacy relative density always works

2480.4 --> 2486.88
always it works so well

2483.92 --> 2488.88
that q is even trying to forward and

2486.88 --> 2490.0
when he says that is probably pretty

2488.88 --> 2492.079
serious

2490.0 --> 2493.52
i'm not directly gonna go there but he's

2492.079 --> 2496.96
even willing to say it

2493.52 --> 2500.079
should be a natural law because

2496.96 --> 2502.319
yeah it's got a point there

2500.079 --> 2504.48
unless at some point there is some

2502.319 --> 2507.2799999999997
unique

2504.48 --> 2509.52
realm position where there is an

2507.28 --> 2511.3590000000004
exception which so far that has not been

2509.52 --> 2513.119
proven that there is an exception to the

2511.359 --> 2515.839
relative density

2513.119 --> 2517.119
within the confine of our realm there's

2515.839 --> 2520.0789999999997
no variation

2517.119 --> 2520.079
in how much

2520.319 --> 2524.56
displacement is caused by the

2523.599 --> 2526.7200000000003
differential

2524.56 --> 2527.92
between an object and the medium at any

2526.72 --> 2531.1189999999997
location in the realm

2527.92 --> 2532.88
there's no proof for this so yes

2531.119 --> 2534.319
it might just as well be considered a

2532.88 --> 2538.1600000000003
natural law

2534.319 --> 2540.56
at it yeah no law of gravity but

2538.16 --> 2542.48
there is potentially a law of relative

2540.56 --> 2551.2799999999997
density oh

2542.48 --> 2554.56
yeah globbers don't like that do they

2551.28 --> 2557.119
is this add or something i just

2554.56 --> 2558.56
explained this acceleration requires a

2557.119 --> 2560.7200000000003
force what is that force relative

2558.56 --> 2562.72
density this equilibrium force that's

2560.72 --> 2565.68
the force

2562.72 --> 2568.0
when an object is at equilib this

2565.68 --> 2571.2799999999997
equilibrium

2568.0 --> 2571.839
right which means that it's less or more

2571.28 --> 2574.6400000000003
dense

2571.839 --> 2575.119
than the medium it is in a force will

2574.64 --> 2579.04
set

2575.119 --> 2580.88
in that's how it happens that's when the

2579.04 --> 2582.4
force arrived that's when acceleration

2580.88 --> 2583.44
starts to happen or with the lack of

2582.4 --> 2586.2400000000002
maneuverability

2583.44 --> 2587.52
pressure the pressure can be either way

2586.24 --> 2592.0
a helium balloon

2587.52 --> 2595.44
will exert pressure upward

2592.0 --> 2600.0
if blocked when in a medium of

2595.44 --> 2601.76
regular air because it is less dense

2600.0 --> 2603.44
than the air it is in it's going to move

2601.76 --> 2604.96
upward but hey if something is blocking

2603.44 --> 2606.96
it then it will exert

2604.96 --> 2609.28
pressure upwards not going to be a lot

2606.96 --> 2611.28
of pressure but there is pressure

2609.28 --> 2613.079
because that's how it works it's

2611.28 --> 2615.8390000000004
relative density

2613.079 --> 2619.6800000000003
disequilibrium

2615.839 --> 2622.16
force which either

2619.68 --> 2622.96
causes acceleration and movement or

2622.16 --> 2626.319
pressure

2622.96 --> 2626.88
if it cannot move it is not a force i'll

2626.319 --> 2630.96
just say

2626.88 --> 2634.0
no no it's not a force no

2630.96 --> 2637.28
no can't be my

2634.0 --> 2638.8
gravity this is my gravity where's my

2637.28 --> 2641.28
gravity

2638.8 --> 2643.44
it must be gravity it can't be a force

2641.28 --> 2646.079
relative density disequilibrium

2643.44 --> 2646.8
no it can't be a force because i'm not

2646.079 --> 2648.96
willing to

2646.8 --> 2650.88
entertain the entire framework of how

2648.96 --> 2653.44
it's supposed to work

2650.88 --> 2654.6400000000003
which you can actually empirically test

2653.44 --> 2657.119
for yourself in

2654.64 --> 2658.56
any way you see fit you can get all

2657.119 --> 2661.6800000000003
fantastical about it

2658.56 --> 2662.64
and complicate it the thing is it always

2661.68 --> 2666.7999999999997
works

2662.64 --> 2666.7999999999997
it always works

2671.839 --> 2676.0
it's a jam panda all right that's good

2675.359 --> 2679.5989999999997
for him

2676.0 --> 2681.76
or good for him it's really sad

2679.599 --> 2683.28
but yeah you gotta come up with an

2681.76 --> 2686.6400000000003
actual argument

2683.28 --> 2691.8390000000004
saying no is not an argument

2686.64 --> 2691.839
it's not a rebuttal

2701.839 --> 2709.52
i already explained this to you

2705.359 --> 2711.5989999999997
objects fall down in a vacuum

2709.52 --> 2714.72
not because of the pressure it's

2711.599 --> 2717.3590000000004
pressure has nothing to do with it

2714.72 --> 2719.52
like air pressure liquid pressure it's

2717.359 --> 2721.92
not about pressure of the medium against

2719.52 --> 2723.839
the object it's not related to relative

2721.92 --> 2727.6800000000003
density it's something else

2723.839 --> 2730.7999999999997
no it's only the density

2727.68 --> 2734.319
not pressure the density

2730.8 --> 2736.2400000000002
of the object versus the medium

2734.319 --> 2738.079
that is what causes relative density

2736.24 --> 2742.0
this equilibrium force

2738.079 --> 2745.28
if it if the differential is big enough

2742.0 --> 2748.88
not pressure the pressure is

2745.28 --> 2751.92
what could potentially come

2748.88 --> 2754.0
if an object is at this equilibrium

2751.92 --> 2757.04
with its surrounding but it can't

2754.0 --> 2760.4
maneuver towards where it's

2757.04 --> 2763.119
where it wants to go towards equi to try

2760.4 --> 2764.8
and equalize the equilibrium by if it's

2763.119 --> 2766.319
heavier if it's denser than the

2764.8 --> 2768.2400000000002
surrounding going down well if it can't

2766.319 --> 2770.48
maneuver further it's being blocked

2768.24 --> 2771.9199999999996
then it will translate translate into

2770.48 --> 2776.4
local pressure

2771.92 --> 2776.4
it's not an air pressure type thing

2779.04 --> 2783.359
it's not the same you're you're mixing

2780.88 --> 2783.359
them up

2783.68 --> 2787.5989999999997
there is no meat yes there is a medium

2785.599 --> 2789.3590000000004
in a vacuum

2787.599 --> 2792.079
of course there's a medium in a vacuum

2789.359 --> 2794.0789999999997
even in a perfectly theoretical perfect

2792.079 --> 2797.92
vacuum which is impossible

2794.079 --> 2801.04
physically things would still go down

2797.92 --> 2804.7200000000003
because that perfect vacuum is

2801.04 --> 2806.8
infinitely less dense than the object

2804.72 --> 2808.24
so it's going to go down at a maximum

2806.8 --> 2812.0
rate

2808.24 --> 2814.7999999999997
see how that works it's it's not about

2812.0 --> 2816.24
things being there it's about the

2814.8 --> 2820.5600000000004
average density

2816.24 --> 2822.8799999999997
of whatever is there and if it's nothing

2820.56 --> 2824.56
well then the density of that nothing is

2822.88 --> 2827.04
extremely low

2824.56 --> 2828.319
compared to the density of the object

2827.04 --> 2831.839
how hard is this

2828.319 --> 2831.839
come on

2833.359 --> 2835.92
what do you mean

2842.88 --> 2847.2000000000003
infinite flat curve is that if that is

2845.2 --> 2847.7599999999998
what you really think then you are an

2847.2 --> 2851.2
absolute

2847.76 --> 2853.6800000000003
[ __ ] you are a [ __ ] [ __ ] and

2851.2 --> 2856.839
probably a liar baller in disguise

2853.68 --> 2860.0789999999997
infinite flat curve that's absolutely

2856.839 --> 2861.599
[ __ ] there is no relative direction

2860.079 --> 2864.079
the direction

2861.599 --> 2866.0
is not relative it's not about the

2864.079 --> 2868.48
freaking relativity theory

2866.0 --> 2870.319
that directions and it's all right no

2868.48 --> 2873.68
it's not about that it's only

2870.319 --> 2876.16
the relativity between

2873.68 --> 2878.0
the density of the medium and the

2876.16 --> 2881.44
density of the object the

2878.0 --> 2882.48
directions are absolutely set there's no

2881.44 --> 2885.359
relativity

2882.48 --> 2886.559
about the direction the directions are

2885.359 --> 2890.16
universal

2886.559 --> 2894.6400000000003
and they're always the same always

2890.16 --> 2897.359
up or down depending on the differential

2894.64 --> 2898.72
always up or down no other directions it

2897.359 --> 2900.0789999999997
doesn't

2898.72 --> 2901.9199999999996
it doesn't matter if you're gonna

2900.079 --> 2904.4
evacuate something

2901.92 --> 2905.28
it's not just gonna suddenly float off

2904.4 --> 2907.52
into

2905.28 --> 2909.28
space locally created like some kind of

2907.52 --> 2911.599
stupid fantasy no

2909.28 --> 2912.3190000000004
it's always going to go up or down

2911.599 --> 2916.319
always

2912.319 --> 2920.2
up or down always up or down always

2916.319 --> 2924.079
up or down always up or down

2920.2 --> 2929.839
always up or down

2924.079 --> 2929.8390000000004
okay do you understand

2930.24 --> 2935.7599999999998
all right i'm gonna round out the show

2932.24 --> 2938.3999999999996
it's a pretty intensive flatter show

2935.76 --> 2940.559
so thanks everyone for coming i hope you

2938.4 --> 2942.48
liked the show i thought it was a blast

2940.559 --> 2944.6400000000003
if you did then please don't forget to

2942.48 --> 2946.319
rogan's it up and if you haven't already

2944.64 --> 2947.92
subscribe to my channel and hit the bell

2946.319 --> 2948.5589999999997
notification so you know when i'm going

2947.92 --> 2950.8
live

2948.559 --> 2951.599
which is normally 2 p.m amsterdam time

2950.8 --> 2953.52
every day

2951.599 --> 2955.3590000000004
and please also do support me through

2953.52 --> 2957.44
the paypal patreon the super chat and

2955.359 --> 2958.96
the membership system join button

2957.44 --> 2961.04
they'll be much appreciated and can

2958.96 --> 2962.7200000000003
still i still really need it so please

2961.04 --> 2965.2
keep the support coming

2962.72 --> 2966.64
and thanks everyone for their patience

2965.2 --> 2969.7599999999998
and hey

2966.64 --> 2972.48
i'm worth it i make a good show

2969.76 --> 2974.4
i'm good at what i do i can be fooled

2972.48 --> 2976.4
and i'm here also to keep

2974.4 --> 2977.76
your minds clear because it seems that a

2976.4 --> 2980.319
lot of you

2977.76 --> 2982.559
even the regular seem to wander off and

2980.319 --> 2985.2799999999997
get caught up in

2982.559 --> 2987.28
in vague speculations of others and your

2985.28 --> 2990.4
suspense of disbelief is apparently

2987.28 --> 2993.52
very difficult to to keep

2990.4 --> 2994.079
track of that still and i understand

2993.52 --> 2997.2
because

2994.079 --> 2998.0
it's all complicated material but you

2997.2 --> 3000.3999999999996
gotta be

2998.0 --> 3002.4
precise this is qe always says you gotta

3000.4 --> 3003.44
be exact you have to be or you're gonna

3002.4 --> 3005.28
get lost

3003.44 --> 3007.76
and then you're gonna lose all grip and

3005.28 --> 3010.48
oversight it's very important

3007.76 --> 3012.2400000000002
to be exact and that's partially also

3010.48 --> 3014.079
why i am here

3012.24 --> 3018.5589999999997
right anyway i will be back tomorrow

3014.079 --> 3019.8390000000004
with flat earth early word number 668

3018.559 --> 3021.3590000000004
and i'm gonna join the flat earth

3019.839 --> 3022.319
debates right after this it's already

3021.359 --> 3027.52
starting up

3022.319 --> 3041.839
uh hashtag mifa indeed over mukul

3027.52 --> 3041.839
and until the next video keep it flat

3042.62 --> 3062.85
[Music]

3071.839 --> 3073.92
you
