beautiful

119.36 --> 122.479
pretty clear side

122.64 --> 127.04
there have been some trails but

127.52 --> 133.44
yeah most of it seems to dissolve

131.2 --> 134.64
yeah but there's still some remnants of

133.44 --> 137.04
haze but

134.64 --> 139.92
overall it is still pretty blue

137.04 --> 143.28
hope it mostly stays that way

139.92 --> 145.35999999999999
the rest of the afternoon

143.28 --> 147.76
because it's really nice and sunny it is

145.36 --> 149.68
a bit windy though

147.76 --> 152.319
still

149.68 --> 154.959
not super warm because of that but yeah

152.319 --> 157.83999999999997
very nice

154.959 --> 157.84
overall

158.72 --> 165.0

161.68 --> 165.0
out of nowhere

i have no idea if there will be any

206.48 --> 209.48
today

214.959 --> 219.519
no idea exactly what is going on with

217.84 --> 220.799
nathan

219.519 --> 221.76000000000002
but yeah

220.799 --> 224.64000000000001

224.64 --> 230.319
i'll keep going in a little longer i did

226.879 --> 230.319
start a bit late today so

233.36 --> 237.4
hello pjc net

245.04 --> 247.28
ah

252.319 --> 254.879
yeah

253.68 --> 258.959
man

254.879 --> 258.959
yesterday was a pretty intense day

260.959 --> 265.04
i think my show was pretty good i didn't

263.52 --> 267.12
watch it back though and there were

265.04 --> 269.44
other streams that have since

267.12 --> 272.16
caught my attention

269.44 --> 275.28
jim bob had an amazing

272.16 --> 275.28000000000003
show yesterday

277.199 --> 282.88
that's really good had like a very

280.32 --> 285.36
spirited guy

282.88 --> 288.88
called in

285.36 --> 290.8
and like he started to do

288.88 --> 291.68
fractal speaking

290.8 --> 293.91900000000004
like

291.68 --> 296.16
he was basically attempting to do

293.919 --> 300.08
something that i recognize is like hey

296.16 --> 300.08000000000004
that's what i try to do in ways

302.16 --> 305.47900000000004
come on

310.56 --> 316.96
hello slo-mo moon buggy letter sage

313.52 --> 319.12
right anyway i was really inspired in

316.96 --> 321.75899999999996
the chat there and was basically just

319.12 --> 321.759
rolling out

323.6 --> 326.639
channelings

325.039 --> 327.59999999999997
you might call it

326.639 --> 329.52
dude

327.6 --> 331.64000000000004
why

329.52 --> 334.69
nothing is happening

331.64 --> 334.69
[Music]

344.8 --> 348.32
i might have to check it might be the

346.8 --> 350.639
port

348.32 --> 353.199
might have to try

350.639 --> 355.28000000000003
putting it in another port and see if it

353.199 --> 357.91900000000004
keeps happening the same way because it

355.28 --> 360.63899999999995
might literally be the part

357.919 --> 360.639
at this point

364.24 --> 367.24
anyway

368.24 --> 372.88
yeah

369.36 --> 375.44
jim bob's stream was very inspiring

372.88 --> 376.88
don't even remember like

375.44 --> 380.52
what

376.88 --> 382.15999999999997
yeah it was about the trinity and

380.52 --> 385.039
cross-referencing it with other

382.16 --> 386.56
religions and it was just very broad and

385.039 --> 388.96
very

386.56 --> 390.96
intense

388.96 --> 395.4
great stream if you haven't checked it

390.96 --> 395.4
out watch jim bob

395.44 --> 401.12
like the streams called foundations with

398.0 --> 401.12
guest hotel

402.24 --> 405.36
that was the one right

407.68 --> 410.479
oh yeah

409.52 --> 415.35999999999996
also

410.479 --> 417.36
sean uploaded a snippet of my video

415.36 --> 418.96000000000004
and he

417.36 --> 421.44
mentioning me

418.96 --> 425.919
and he like oh

421.44 --> 428.71999999999997
i ha ha ha what a funny point

425.919 --> 432.24
but i like i didn't even understand like

428.72 --> 434.0
what the point was of sean

432.24 --> 437.52
taking that snippet out because i was

434.0 --> 441.28
describing about like

437.52 --> 442.96
yeah spirit mechanics esoterics like

441.28 --> 444.31899999999996
micro sin

442.96 --> 446.23999999999995
and how like

444.319 --> 447.599
snapping somebody out of their dream

446.24 --> 450.88
when they're not

447.599 --> 452.639
looking for it is like bad versus

450.88 --> 455.36
letting somebody come to you when

452.639 --> 456.40000000000003
they're curious then it's good

455.36 --> 458.40000000000003
right

456.4 --> 460.479
and he took a snippet of that and

458.4 --> 462.31899999999996
somehow thought it had a point and i'm

460.479 --> 463.28
like

462.319 --> 466.319
i

463.28 --> 468.15999999999997
like i really don't get it john

466.319 --> 470.319
do you get it

468.16 --> 472.319
because i doubt it i like are you

470.319 --> 474.0
gaslighting like you think you have a

472.319 --> 475.44
point

474.0 --> 478.319
because

475.44 --> 481.039
i don't see it

478.319 --> 481.03900000000004
that was funny

481.36 --> 489.08000000000004
also watched howdy machowski's video

486.08 --> 489.08
on

492.24 --> 499.36
matt from quantum of consciousness

495.039 --> 503.28
website free voice dot io

499.36 --> 504.84000000000003
about the the design of the pantheon

503.28 --> 508.0
and suppose it

504.84 --> 511.28
hadrian the designer of that in roman

508.0 --> 511.28
times and it is

512.88 --> 515.599
heavy stuff

517.039 --> 520.519
very interesting

520.56 --> 526.16
link you guys up to that video

522.32 --> 529.279
specifically like and you will you will

526.16 --> 529.279
want to check that out

529.44 --> 534.9200000000001
so some really interesting videos very

531.92 --> 534.92
inspired

538.16 --> 541.76
except for the sean smart

540.56 --> 544.0799999999999
that was just

541.76 --> 544.08
silly

545.1 --> 548.48
[Music]

546.56 --> 550.64
sean's parents have been asked the same

548.48 --> 553.6800000000001
question i wonder if he's if his parents

550.64 --> 553.68
are even still alive

554.399 --> 557.839
don't give it a lot of chance

558.0 --> 563.64
uh

560.08 --> 563.64
hey jeff gassett

566.16 --> 572.24
just found that stream foundation yes go

569.279 --> 572.24
tell right good

574.64 --> 578.88
feel free to link it up

576.399 --> 582.0
it is a really good stream like

578.88 --> 584.72
the guest was really

582.0 --> 584.72
in a flow

585.2 --> 589.519
and i recognized that early on like he

587.2 --> 591.76
was very much about orthodox

589.519 --> 592.88
christianity and he had a silly a bit of

591.76 --> 595.8389999999999
a funny

592.88 --> 598.0
part about like yeah it's all about just

595.839 --> 600.24
going with the belief that i immediately

598.0 --> 600.24
chat

600.8 --> 606.64
laid out like how that is diametrically

604.0 --> 610.16
opposed to my

606.64 --> 610.16
foundational operation

610.48 --> 614.16
that yeah if you believe in something

612.72 --> 618.0400000000001
but you don't

614.16 --> 618.04
understand it then

619.12 --> 624.64
you are going to be come vulnerable

622.64 --> 626.8
like based on the percentage of

624.64 --> 628.56
understanding i remember the spectrum

626.8 --> 632.959
between knowing and not knowing yeah

628.56 --> 635.04
yeah playing with that esoterically

632.959 --> 636.56
depending on how much you understand

635.04 --> 639.68
what you believe

636.56 --> 640.959
you will be subjected or you will become

639.68 --> 644.0
vulnerable

640.959 --> 644.8
to that same percentage degree

644.0 --> 647.279
of

644.8 --> 648.959
external delusion

647.279 --> 651.279
frequency wise you will be more

648.959 --> 652.4799999999999
vulnerable to

651.279 --> 654.0
spells

652.48 --> 654.88
being cast

654.0 --> 658.32
like

654.88 --> 659.76
directly parallel to the level of how

658.32 --> 661.12
much

659.76 --> 664.3199999999999
you

661.12 --> 666.24
accept as absolutely true to it to win

664.32 --> 669.2
the core

666.24 --> 671.12
something you don't fully understand

669.2 --> 672.8000000000001
yeah that's what i reason out that's

671.12 --> 674.72
kind of the level

672.8 --> 676.24
that starts rolling out of me in

674.72 --> 679.6
response to that

676.24 --> 679.6
sort of thing in chats

682.64 --> 689.8389999999999
all right so if all's good you could

684.8 --> 689.8389999999999
still read all my comments or all my

690.16 --> 693.519
my chat messages back

695.04 --> 697.76
all right anyway

698.0 --> 702.04
right thanks for posting the link

705.61 --> 708.97
[Music]

710.32 --> 713.399
all right

715.02 --> 718.14
[Music]

730.56 --> 736.6389999999999
i haven't really watched owen benjamin

733.68 --> 738.56
but i'm going to catch up on to that

736.639 --> 741.88
i think

738.56 --> 741.88
soon enough

750.56 --> 754.279
hey borders boy

766.24 --> 768.639
god

770.88 --> 777.56
the whole elon musk twitter situation is

773.68 --> 777.56
such a squirt fest

786.43 --> 789.559
[Music]

789.68 --> 791.92
i mean

790.639 --> 793.6800000000001
there's all these

791.92 --> 796.959
these people like yeah he's gonna make

793.68 --> 796.959
it free again and

797.04 --> 801.279
they haven't been unblocked yet

800.32 --> 804.24
so

801.279 --> 805.43
whatever elon musk was planning to do

804.24 --> 808.0
with this platform

805.43 --> 810.4799999999999
[Music]

808.0 --> 813.6
seems it isn't all that

810.48 --> 816.0790000000001
or he hasn't been able to actually

813.6 --> 817.6
get control over it

816.079 --> 819.68
yet

817.6 --> 821.9200000000001
either way

819.68 --> 824.16
but like every there's like all these

821.92 --> 825.12
groups squirting over it from all sides

824.16 --> 826.7199999999999
so

825.12 --> 829.6
yeah

826.72 --> 832.24
yeah i've been trying to talk about it

829.6 --> 833.839
the least possible amount

832.24 --> 835.44
because i knew everybody was going to be

833.839 --> 839.44
squirting over that and throwing all

835.44 --> 839.44
their hopes on it again of course

844.75 --> 847.97
[Music]

854.839 --> 862.5600000000001
what on a stage talking about

859.12 --> 862.5600000000001
a third coast

862.72 --> 865.0400000000001
what

866.24 --> 869.24
what

879.519 --> 882.519
okay

884.32 --> 890.1600000000001
never heard admiral bird mention any

886.399 --> 894.56
fresh water reservoirs though

890.16 --> 894.56
mean mountains of coal uranium and

894.88 --> 898.399
what was it

896.72 --> 899.9200000000001
other stuff like that

898.399 --> 901.76
but

899.92 --> 905.279
gold i think even

901.76 --> 907.519
never heard about fresh water though

905.279 --> 907.519
so

910.8 --> 916.24
so this guy on stage

913.839 --> 919.7600000000001
how did he get that information i mean

916.24 --> 921.6800000000001
was he like tripping balls

919.76 --> 923.8389999999999
see like

921.68 --> 926.399
spirit traveling and then he's like oh

923.839 --> 928.5600000000001

926.399 --> 931.04
beyond antarctica oh holy [ __ ] there's

928.56 --> 934.0
all these mountains here and look a

931.04 --> 937.8389999999999
giant lake it looks so pure like

934.0 --> 937.839
how did he attain that information

939.68 --> 944.8
or did he just watch an admiral bird

942.16 --> 948.079
video and was like

944.8 --> 950.16
i'm gonna make i'm gonna like really

948.079 --> 952.16
put that out for people to think about

950.16 --> 953.4399999999999
or something in my own way

952.16 --> 955.8389999999999
right

953.44 --> 958.5600000000001
what was that

955.839 --> 958.5600000000001

960.32 --> 963.36
it's a funny video

963.68 --> 968.2399999999999
all right

965.759 --> 970.399
well if you got it on a video somewhere

968.24 --> 972.48
then link it up preferably with a

970.399 --> 974.88
timestamp

972.48 --> 979.32
you can check it out you can try to read

974.88 --> 979.32
off the person what's going on

988.399 --> 991.48
all right

998.079 --> 1005.68
oh and i had pretty late night but

1001.44 --> 1005.6800000000001
i feel incredibly well rested

1006.32 --> 1008.5600000000001
like

1008.959 --> 1014.6389999999999
a lot of like

1011.199 --> 1016.88
my glands and all that which right

1014.639 --> 1020.9590000000001
during even after inflammation

1016.88 --> 1020.959
situations they get kind of like

1021.68 --> 1028.0
start tugging around and they seem to

1025.12 --> 1029.52
all have like really relaxed i had some

1028.0 --> 1031.6
weird

1029.52 --> 1033.039
like minor

1031.6 --> 1036.24
very standard by the way i had that

1033.039 --> 1039.199
since i was very young so like

1036.24 --> 1041.839
where it seems like my kidney starts to

1039.199 --> 1043.919
hurt a bit

1041.839 --> 1046.319
but that has also stopped so i think

1043.919 --> 1047.439
yeah i'm just always trying to figure

1046.319 --> 1049.6789999999999
out what

1047.439 --> 1052.16
is going on in my body because it's so

1049.679 --> 1054.16
elaborate really

1052.16 --> 1057.1200000000001
i will just take it for granted but i

1054.16 --> 1057.1200000000001
want to really know

1059.6 --> 1063.4399999999998
i think like i restored a whole bunch

1062.24 --> 1065.679
this night

1063.44 --> 1067.679
very glad about it

1065.679 --> 1070.0
drink plenty of water i drink plenty of

1067.679 --> 1070.0
water

1072.32 --> 1076.6399999999999
and i don't get dehydrated like not even

1075.44 --> 1078.559
when i'm all

1076.64 --> 1082.3200000000002
behind the computer obsessed over

1078.559 --> 1082.32
something i always have tea

1088.72 --> 1094.32
and i did eat just fine too

1091.6 --> 1095.76
so yeah don't worry about that it's like

1094.32 --> 1098.08
my kidney

1095.76 --> 1100.08
feeling that is not like oh

1098.08 --> 1104.0
something is happening

1100.08 --> 1106.72
no it's just like another switch

1104.0 --> 1109.2
in the procedures and i recognize it as

1106.72 --> 1112.24
such and i'm trying to like more

1109.2 --> 1116.0
specifically identify as to what exactly

1112.24 --> 1116.0
type of switch that is

1116.08 --> 1119.28
to me

1118.08 --> 1121.12
anyway

1119.28 --> 1124.559
stress related no

1121.12 --> 1127.76
no it's nothing natty voyager me

1124.559 --> 1130.6399999999999
mentioning it is not like oh i got a

1127.76 --> 1133.12
symptom i need all you guys to think as

1130.64 --> 1136.5590000000002
to what could be going wrong no that's

1133.12 --> 1138.32
not what that is

1136.559 --> 1141.12
yeah

1138.32 --> 1142.96
it's like a a little poke

1141.12 --> 1145.1999999999998
it's not something i'm worried about

1142.96 --> 1147.039
i've been having that all my life

1145.2 --> 1149.44
it doesn't stay

1147.039 --> 1151.2
it was there for like two days and now

1149.44 --> 1153.679
that is gone again

1151.2 --> 1155.3600000000001
and i feel a whole lot cleared up so to

1153.679 --> 1158.4
me i conclude

1155.36 --> 1159.84
that's like a processing thing that was

1158.4 --> 1162.4
happening

1159.84 --> 1165.28
my kidneys were probably going in a very

1162.4 --> 1167.679
specific setting to clean up a certain

1165.28 --> 1169.2
level of stuff

1167.679 --> 1171.919
that must have been cleaned up now

1169.2 --> 1174.0
before because i feel a lot cleaner even

1171.919 --> 1176.48
though i haven't really

1174.0 --> 1180.799
eaten all that differently or out of

1176.48 --> 1180.799
whack or anything compared to last week

1182.32 --> 1185.6789999999999
so that's how i say it

1189.919 --> 1192.919
okay

1194.48 --> 1200.559
chemical it's chemical release from the

1197.6 --> 1200.559
brain well

1200.64 --> 1204.88
no doubt there's always some kind of

1202.799 --> 1208.24
chemical interaction between the brain

1204.88 --> 1208.24
and organs and all that so

1215.84 --> 1219.72
kidney stones i

1220.08 --> 1225.9189999999999
no but that's actual pain that's not

1222.799 --> 1228.6399999999999
like a little poke

1225.919 --> 1231.44
right sorry for using the word pain i

1228.64 --> 1233.6000000000001
guess pain wouldn't be accurate i'd but

1231.44 --> 1236.24
i do tend like

1233.6 --> 1238.7199999999998
i have a tendency to even call like

1236.24 --> 1241.2
minor nuisance feelings

1238.72 --> 1244.0
like pain because it is basically the

1241.2 --> 1246.64
pain nerve that is getting

1244.0 --> 1252.32
agitated i guess or something

1246.64 --> 1252.3200000000002
it's just it might be a language thing

1255.28 --> 1257.6
anyway

1261.44 --> 1267.44
yeah my kidney stones yeah they suck i

1264.159 --> 1267.44
don't think i've ever had one

1271.039 --> 1274.64
and i don't think i'll get one

1275.12 --> 1281.6
i mean filtering my water the way i do

1277.76 --> 1281.6
certainly does seem to help

1282.64 --> 1288.3200000000002
and avoiding non-organic processed foods

1286.0 --> 1291.32
at all costs

1288.32 --> 1291.32
so

1314.0 --> 1318.4
what are you talking about nandy voyager

1316.72 --> 1323.24
there's not something

1318.4 --> 1323.24
i'm aware of that is doing my head in

1345.6 --> 1350.9599999999998
then why am i addressing the problem no

1348.96 --> 1354.0
i'm just pointing something out it's

1350.96 --> 1356.799
basically like a health report

1354.0 --> 1358.84
you know why it's not because i know you

1356.799 --> 1361.039
all care so

1358.84 --> 1364.0
much about

1361.039 --> 1367.2
my medical condition oh i know you must

1364.0 --> 1370.48
love listening to that right not really

1367.2 --> 1370.48
why do i do it anyway

1370.88 --> 1377.3600000000001
because if i say it then i'll be able to

1375.44 --> 1379.44
see it back

1377.36 --> 1381.4399999999998
it's a journal

1379.44 --> 1384.48
in a way now

1381.44 --> 1387.3600000000001
this just i want to keep track i want to

1384.48 --> 1390.799
understand the cycles that i go through

1387.36 --> 1390.799
i want to understand it better

1394.159 --> 1401.1200000000001
like on an intuitive level

1396.64 --> 1402.88
so i say it i manifest it i

1401.12 --> 1406.1589999999999
bypass any

1402.88 --> 1409.8400000000001
fear that might be bound to become bound

1406.159 --> 1409.8400000000001
to it if i keep it a secret

1410.32 --> 1413.6789999999999
right

1411.36 --> 1416.32
but it doesn't mean that oh he's talking

1413.679 --> 1419.039
about something medical let's all start

1416.32 --> 1422.52
to say about how terrible it could be

1419.039 --> 1422.52
yeah no

1436.08 --> 1442.76
that really is just

1437.799 --> 1442.76
ssd what does that even mean

1446.96 --> 1452.64
does anybody else here understand what

1449.12 --> 1452.6399999999999
natty voyager is talking about

1456.0 --> 1459.84
hello by the way lamel forever

1473.2 --> 1476.96
yeah nutty poetry nobody here

1475.44 --> 1479.279
understands what the hell you're talking

1476.96 --> 1479.279
about

1480.159 --> 1484.88
i mean you might be like really high or

1482.88 --> 1487.6000000000001
something

1484.88 --> 1489.7600000000002
because you're blabbering

1487.6 --> 1492.0
like i can't connect it like i was

1489.76 --> 1494.0
trying to interface with you through

1492.0 --> 1495.6
what i was communicating about thinking

1494.0 --> 1497.679
that you were talking about that but it

1495.6 --> 1499.1999999999998
doesn't seem to really be the case like

1497.679 --> 1502.0800000000002
we don't really understand what you're

1499.2 --> 1502.0800000000002
talking about now

1503.2 --> 1506.0800000000002
oh

1504.159 --> 1510.279
same [ __ ] different day okay okay we

1506.08 --> 1510.279
just seen it thanks for that

1530.96 --> 1534.96
you are concerned that i'm going

1533.8 --> 1538.0
[Music]

1534.96 --> 1540.64
on about something

1538.0 --> 1543.52
so you're concerned about something

1540.64 --> 1545.919
where you basically insinuate that i am

1543.52 --> 1546.8799999999999
concerned about something

1545.919 --> 1549.2
and then

1546.88 --> 1551.0390000000002
well you think it's just an everyday

1549.2 --> 1553.919
thing no no that's what i've been trying

1551.039 --> 1553.919
to tell you

1554.32 --> 1559.039
i've been telling you

1557.12 --> 1560.8799999999999
this is just a common occurrence i had

1559.039 --> 1564.8799999999999
it my whole life i'm not worried about

1560.88 --> 1564.88
it yeah you don't need

1565.52 --> 1570.559
to tell me how you're concerned about

1568.159 --> 1572.5590000000002
how i'm concerned about what i was

1570.559 --> 1576.32
talking about when i was clearly saying

1572.559 --> 1576.32
that i'm not concerned about it

1583.52 --> 1589.36
sneddy voyager the maggot guy

1586.32 --> 1591.52
hmm interesting

1589.36 --> 1594.9599999999998
he does seem a bit wacky and he is

1591.52 --> 1598.279
projecting a lot it seems

1594.96 --> 1598.279
i don't know

1606.74 --> 1609.89
[Music]

1643.76 --> 1649.2
humanitarians

1646.32 --> 1652.039
are you rude

1649.2 --> 1654.32
you lacking in a human what what is

1652.039 --> 1656.0
humanitarian understanding have to do

1654.32 --> 1658.72
with

1656.0 --> 1660.72
you being worried about me being

1658.72 --> 1662.64
supposedly worried about something that

1660.72 --> 1665.76
i've literally explained that i'm not

1662.64 --> 1665.76
worried about really

1666.24 --> 1670.0
what does that have to do with your

1667.6 --> 1672.799
humanitarian understanding it's just a

1670.0 --> 1676.12
weird unnecessary type of projection

1672.799 --> 1676.12
that's all

1686.32 --> 1690.0
okay then

1690.799 --> 1696.0
i don't have the tenacity

1693.279 --> 1699.84
to understand myself

1696.0 --> 1702.48
that might be a hundred percent deep

1699.84 --> 1706.24
rejection there

1702.48 --> 1708.64
because i definitely have the tenacity

1706.24 --> 1711.52
to understand myself

1708.64 --> 1716.0
i arguably sacrificed

1711.52 --> 1716.0
more than i should have to do so

1721.44 --> 1728.3200000000002
trivial crap okay

1724.48 --> 1730.48
well i'm sorry that you feel that way

1728.32 --> 1732.559
don't come back

1730.48 --> 1734.08
huh

1732.559 --> 1736.559
how about that

1734.08 --> 1738.6399999999999
if you don't like what i do

1736.559 --> 1741.6399999999999
get the [ __ ] out

1738.64 --> 1741.64
huh

1745.76 --> 1748.95
[Music]

1752.3 --> 1756.609
[Music]

1756.799 --> 1759.52
i

1758.24 --> 1761.6
don't know what's wrong with these

1759.52 --> 1763.84
people like why do these

1761.6 --> 1766.48
weirdo half

1763.84 --> 1769.4399999999998
drugged up people barely holding on to

1766.48 --> 1772.3990000000001
their last faculty like why do they get

1769.44 --> 1774.96
in my chat and do that

1772.399 --> 1778.4799999999998
like why do these weirdo drunk people

1774.96 --> 1781.8400000000001
keep wandering into my shaman's hut

1778.48 --> 1781.84
i don't get it

1786.64 --> 1790.3200000000002
because that is kind of what it feels

1788.08 --> 1792.6399999999999
like i mean i love having you guys here

1790.32 --> 1795.52
and you you guys get it right it's like

1792.64 --> 1797.039
sort of like a mini temple shaman's hut

1795.52 --> 1800.399
or something

1797.039 --> 1802.96
and it's just these weirdo belligerent

1800.399 --> 1804.2399999999998
drunks just start wandering in all of a

1802.96 --> 1806.08
sudden

1804.24 --> 1807.679
and not even talking about anti-flat

1806.08 --> 1811.1999999999998
earther this guy was not like an

1807.679 --> 1811.2
anti-flat earth he's just like

1811.36 --> 1813.84
weird

1814.159 --> 1819.44
might be related to sean

1816.88 --> 1821.679
no gods

1819.44 --> 1824.0800000000002
i hope not for him

1821.679 --> 1829.0
i mean i would become a belligerent

1824.08 --> 1829.0
drunk if shawn hawkins was my family

1835.43 --> 1838.529
[Music]

1843.36 --> 1846.36
so

1856.399 --> 1860.7199999999998
okay okay

1858.64 --> 1862.7990000000002
anyway he's not there anymore i banned

1860.72 --> 1864.559
him so

1862.799 --> 1867.2
let's try to

1864.559 --> 1867.2
move on

1869.919 --> 1873.039
what was i talking about

1875.76 --> 1879.08
great streams

1881.2 --> 1885.679
oh

1883.12 --> 1889.5189999999998
oh yeah slow-mo moon buggy you did find

1885.679 --> 1891.44
that video of the guy that mentioned the

1889.519 --> 1894.72
third coast

1891.44 --> 1894.72
did you timestamp it

1897.36 --> 1903.32
a grateful dead oh goody

1900.96 --> 1907.039
oh yeah that's a

1903.32 --> 1909.2
38 minute video

1907.039 --> 1911.84
okay i'm gonna have to check it out

1909.2 --> 1911.8400000000001
afterward

1917.679 --> 1923.8400000000001
yeah steamy traveler hello

1921.44 --> 1926.799
what do i think about your most moving

1923.84 --> 1929.12
twitter i think it's being supremely

1926.799 --> 1930.72
overhyped

1929.12 --> 1934.4799999999998
and

1930.72 --> 1937.1200000000001
like to remind everybody that musk has a

1934.48 --> 1939.679
bit of a catastrophic

1937.12 --> 1939.6789999999999
record

1939.76 --> 1944.08
what he does

1941.84 --> 1944.08
so

1944.799 --> 1949.36
yeah i think that a lot of like

1947.279 --> 1951.44
people that have been suppressed by like

1949.36 --> 1952.799
the woke

1951.44 --> 1953.679
the demon

1952.799 --> 1956.24
side

1953.679 --> 1957.679
that they've all been like oh finally we

1956.24 --> 1960.08
we're going to be free we're going to be

1957.679 --> 1961.519
let back on and i kind of doubt it i

1960.08 --> 1963.76
don't think so it doesn't really it

1961.519 --> 1965.6
doesn't seem to have happened so far i

1963.76 --> 1968.24
think everybody got their hopes up but

1965.6 --> 1972.48
elon musk is just

1968.24 --> 1972.48
doing his weird elon musk thing

1972.64 --> 1977.519
i don't think it's gonna really

1974.32 --> 1979.84
accomplish anything

1977.519 --> 1979.84
it's just

1980.159 --> 1987.2
it's just mega corporations switching

1984.799 --> 1988.96
controller

1987.2 --> 1991.44
i don't think they're like even gonna

1988.96 --> 1993.519
unban everything

1991.44 --> 1997.279
or do anything about the woke

1993.519 --> 1997.279
persecution and all that [ __ ]

1998.48 --> 2003.1200000000001
like maybe like i'm i've gone i've

2000.96 --> 2006.24
basically jokingly

2003.12 --> 2009.4399999999998
hinted that oh elon musk oh he's so good

2006.24 --> 2012.159
oh yeah it was super busy right super

2009.44 --> 2014.799
busy way too busy way too busy to truly

2012.159 --> 2016.3200000000002
keep a grip on it all

2014.799 --> 2018.8799999999999
right

2016.32 --> 2021.36
so who's to say he's actually gonna be

2018.88 --> 2024.0800000000002
able to get a grip

2021.36 --> 2026.6399999999999
on like a giant social media platform

2024.08 --> 2029.279
like that in order

2026.64 --> 2031.3600000000001
to actually create some order out of it

2029.279 --> 2034.24
it's much more likely he's just buying

2031.36 --> 2037.76
it up and kind of not having grip on it

2034.24 --> 2039.279
and just being the pr person for it

2037.76 --> 2042.1589999999999
right and

2039.279 --> 2044.32
we might not even change the most basic

2042.159 --> 2046.48
of settings about it you might not be

2044.32 --> 2048.3199999999997
able to actually do that

2046.48 --> 2050.399
yeah we hope

2048.32 --> 2052.96
a lot of people hope that in ways they

2050.399 --> 2055.2
could do that but there's no guarantee

2052.96 --> 2056.96
actually will do that

2055.2 --> 2061.1589999999997
yeah

2056.96 --> 2061.159
so hold your horses

2061.679 --> 2065.2000000000003
just

2063.2 --> 2067.52
let it roll for a bit see what he's

2065.2 --> 2070.56
actually gonna do because

2067.52 --> 2072.0
yeah there's no guaranteed wind here or

2070.56 --> 2075.32
something

2072.0 --> 2075.32
or good

2075.44 --> 2080.2400000000002
it's kind of a muddy situation from my

2078.079 --> 2083.2400000000002
point of view so that's my opinion on

2080.24 --> 2083.24
that

2089.919 --> 2092.919
so

2104.32 --> 2107.32
huh

2123.119 --> 2127.28
he isn't rich either

2125.839 --> 2130.16
well

2127.28 --> 2132.8
yeah it seems he's much more a guy that

2130.16 --> 2136.64
just has really big connections but that

2132.8 --> 2136.6400000000003
makes him an actor for

2137.52 --> 2141.839
the money

2139.44 --> 2143.44
you could you could say that he doesn't

2141.839 --> 2146.56
actually own it

2143.44 --> 2146.56
it owns him

2151.119 --> 2154.079
is to keep going

2153.04 --> 2157.4
for

2154.079 --> 2157.4
money power

2170.64 --> 2176.16
oh yeah yeah that happened too yeah ken

2173.52 --> 2180.4
wheeler and jiren's video

2176.16 --> 2180.3999999999996
was great you thought he was great

2182.079 --> 2186.96
i don't know

2183.599 --> 2189.2000000000003
thank you yeah great is a big word

2186.96 --> 2189.2
but

2190.48 --> 2195.04
if people here

2192.4 --> 2198.0
like him like seeking star water i'm

2195.04 --> 2201.7599999999998
sorry i i naturally don't really like

2198.0 --> 2204.56
tattoo jabba the hutt okay ken wheeler

2201.76 --> 2207.5200000000004
he said a lot of stupid things and he is

2204.56 --> 2211.04
a wizard that likes the technobabble and

2207.52 --> 2211.92
that's a fact that's a fact

2211.04 --> 2214.4
right

2211.92 --> 2216.76
but hey if he's actually

2214.4 --> 2221.8
like trying to

2216.76 --> 2225.28
alleviate himself outside of just

2221.8 --> 2227.76
mesmerizing a a flock with his technobab

2225.28 --> 2232.079
when he actually wants to progress this

2227.76 --> 2234.5600000000004
for real and in within honesty not

2232.079 --> 2237.04
not just to get some cash in

2234.56 --> 2240.24
some safe space with the beast

2237.04 --> 2242.8
then yeah i'm willing to see that as a

2240.24 --> 2245.4399999999996
possibility so i'm just kind of curious

2242.8 --> 2248.32
what he's going to do next

2245.44 --> 2251.119
and yeah he might still be able to

2248.32 --> 2254.96
improve my

2251.119 --> 2257.839
my judgment of him if you will

2254.96 --> 2257.839
right

2258.079 --> 2264.079
but yeah he has said some really

2262.24 --> 2267.2799999999997
well it's not stupid it's just that he's

2264.079 --> 2268.48
just been very focused on techno babble

2267.28 --> 2271.6800000000003
in ways

2268.48 --> 2273.68
and people really love him for that

2271.68 --> 2276.0
so

2273.68 --> 2276.0
yeah

2278.48 --> 2282.96
right but if he's actually willing to

2280.48 --> 2285.359
really dig into flat earth well let's

2282.96 --> 2287.04
see let's see will he come on the flat

2285.359 --> 2288.48
earth debates

2287.04 --> 2290.64
right

2288.48 --> 2293.04
now if he does that and he's willing to

2290.64 --> 2295.5989999999997
sit through an ethonian session like

2293.04 --> 2297.119
that willing to take the heat because of

2295.599 --> 2298.88
some of the things he said in the past

2297.119 --> 2300.7200000000003
and can still be gracious

2298.88 --> 2304.1600000000003
then he will

2300.72 --> 2306.7999999999997
gain my respect a lot

2304.16 --> 2308.8799999999997
and i will even then potentially

2306.8 --> 2312.5600000000004
depending on how well he does that

2308.88 --> 2314.56
apologize to some level

2312.56 --> 2316.0789999999997
for some of my opinions of him in the

2314.56 --> 2318.16
past

2316.079 --> 2319.92
some of the jokes

2318.16 --> 2322.3199999999997
although i'm never really going to take

2319.92 --> 2323.76
away the jabba the tattoo jabba because

2322.32 --> 2325.599
he is

2323.76 --> 2327.2000000000003
that's just the fact that's not going to

2325.599 --> 2328.6400000000003
go away either

2327.2 --> 2331.1189999999997
but i might say

2328.64 --> 2334.0
tattoo jabbed hot in a more loving

2331.119 --> 2334.0
fashion right

2338.64 --> 2342.96
just as i would

2341.04 --> 2345.2
call brian

2342.96 --> 2345.2
like

2347.2 --> 2353.64
a math leprechaun

2349.52 --> 2353.64
like that's a loving title

2359.44 --> 2361.68
yeah

2362.079 --> 2366.6400000000003
i'm really glad that brian is a very

2363.92 --> 2366.64
good person

2366.88 --> 2371.359
because if he would actually not be nice

2369.52 --> 2374.079
it would really suck

2371.359 --> 2375.92
and then i would not call him a math

2374.079 --> 2378.5600000000004
leprechaun

2375.92 --> 2378.56
with love

2379.92 --> 2382.92
right

2411.92 --> 2415.28
okay

2413.28 --> 2418.079
the bible means political entity yeah

2415.28 --> 2418.079
that makes sense

2420.72 --> 2428.64
i see the beast as like a collective

2424.88 --> 2432.0
autopilot driven will

2428.64 --> 2434.16
it's a will that yields certain things

2432.0 --> 2435.119
that transforms everything in a certain

2434.16 --> 2437.44
way

2435.119 --> 2439.119
and it is based on like an automated

2437.44 --> 2441.92
fallback position

2439.119 --> 2442.88
that's how it drives

2441.92 --> 2445.2000000000003
right so

2442.88 --> 2447.04
it doesn't work like an irregular

2445.2 --> 2453.0
consciousness

2447.04 --> 2453.0
it is a collective will but it is like

2453.359 --> 2455.68
it is

2456.0 --> 2459.92
in a lot of ways driven by weakness or

2458.72 --> 2462.16
it can

2459.92 --> 2466.16
be driven by weakness

2462.16 --> 2469.16
can still propel itself

2466.16 --> 2469.16
anyways

2479.02 --> 2485.92
[Music]

2483.28 --> 2488.6400000000003
comparison to basis and dr evil yeah

2485.92 --> 2490.2400000000002
well that comparison was always kind of

2488.64 --> 2492.56
jarring

2490.24 --> 2496.72
it's almost like bases was like on

2492.56 --> 2496.72
purpose seeking out the stereotype

2506.839 --> 2512.88
sometimes i mean all bezos really needs

2509.92 --> 2514.64
now is a mini me that looks exactly like

2512.88 --> 2516.48
him

2514.64 --> 2519.7599999999998
and yeah

2516.48 --> 2523.119
and then he will simply become called dr

2519.76 --> 2527.44
evil and that's never gonna go away

2523.119 --> 2527.44
it's just only a mini me and he's there

2533.44 --> 2538.88
especially if he makes a mini me rocket

2537.119 --> 2540.9100000000003
for his mini me

2538.88 --> 2543.359
you know he can do that

2540.91 --> 2548.1189999999997
[Music]

2543.359 --> 2548.119
people never stop talking about it

2550.56 --> 2553.69
[Music]

2559.28 --> 2566.5600000000004
elon musk in the iron man film

2564.24 --> 2566.56
what

2570.16 --> 2573.1189999999997
elon musk

2573.359 --> 2579.52
in iron what are you talking about elon

2575.92 --> 2582.64
musk in iron man what

2579.52 --> 2582.64
is he really in there

2586.24 --> 2592.3999999999996
claus schwab has a super fake accent

2589.04 --> 2594.64
i think so too i think that he is

2592.4 --> 2596.7200000000003
it's like a cartoon accent it's a

2594.64 --> 2599.1189999999997
cartoon character of himself that he's

2596.72 --> 2599.1189999999997
playing

2601.2 --> 2608.72
he wants to be like a

2604.24 --> 2610.7999999999997
a crossover between the emperor and

2608.72 --> 2615.64
and like a

2610.8 --> 2615.6400000000003
a nazi general or something

2622.05 --> 2626.079
[Music]

2623.839 --> 2628.64
that's right holy [ __ ] dude

2626.079 --> 2629.52
tony wisconsin i am

2628.64 --> 2632.96
dead

2629.52 --> 2635.2
elon musk goes in there what

2632.96 --> 2637.44
dude that must been that must have been

2635.2 --> 2638.96
when i like really didn't know about him

2637.44 --> 2641.2000000000003
yet

2638.96 --> 2643.839
now i almost have to like watch back

2641.2 --> 2646.7999999999997
iron man the original movie is he really

2643.839 --> 2648.07
in there that is so weird

2646.8 --> 2651.369
that is so weird

2648.07 --> 2651.369
[Music]

2659.119 --> 2665.52
if you want to analyze world stage

2661.28 --> 2665.52
actors you need pc no not really

2667.839 --> 2674.0789999999997
but if you have a pc

2671.04 --> 2679.92
then it you're very likely that you end

2674.079 --> 2679.92
up analyzing world stage actors for sure

2682.079 --> 2686.6400000000003
it's no coincidence

2684.319 --> 2689.359
no i'm sure it's not i just i'm kind of

2686.64 --> 2690.64
weirded out because i don't remember him

2689.359 --> 2693.04
like

2690.64 --> 2695.1189999999997
i guess that i just didn't really care

2693.04 --> 2698.96
about elon musk in the slightest back

2695.119 --> 2698.96
then and i just don't remember it

2699.76 --> 2704.4
or maybe i was really annoyed by him

2702.16 --> 2706.7999999999997
because he already felt like he was like

2704.4 --> 2709.599
a new world order puppet to distract us

2706.8 --> 2711.6800000000003
so i just erased it

2709.599 --> 2715.8
because i did think iron man was a

2711.68 --> 2715.7999999999997
really impressive film

2730.0 --> 2733.0
um

2746.0 --> 2748.4
what

2750.16 --> 2754.319
so films are important what are you

2751.839 --> 2756.72
saying that things made by freemasons

2754.319 --> 2758.72
and jews are not important

2756.72 --> 2760.48
plateau plat

2758.72 --> 2763.839
do you even know

2760.48 --> 2766.079
what the hell is going on here

2763.839 --> 2766.0789999999997
what

2767.68 --> 2772.3999999999996
i mean important

2769.68 --> 2775.52
who says they're important even like

2772.4 --> 2777.92
it's just that they're there

2775.52 --> 2781.119
they do provide framework for a whole

2777.92 --> 2783.92
bunch of people's behavior

2781.119 --> 2786.319
we can't stop that from happening at

2783.92 --> 2788.88
this time because the society is fully

2786.319 --> 2791.92
immersed in movie culture and all that

2788.88 --> 2794.96
it's already gone beyond the stage to do

2791.92 --> 2797.92
anything about it so we might as well

2794.96 --> 2800.839
learn as much about it as we can

2797.92 --> 2802.88
to see and be able become able to

2800.839 --> 2805.599
predict how

2802.88 --> 2807.52
it's all going to influence everybody

2805.599 --> 2810.2400000000002
and what we can do with the remaining

2807.52 --> 2810.24
dynamics

2812.6 --> 2815.659
[Music]

2820.079 --> 2827.28
yeah got an idea for an electric jet

2823.2 --> 2827.2799999999997
did you know that in 2000

2828.48 --> 2834.319
10

2831.2 --> 2837.359
i was i went up to a bunch of people in

2834.319 --> 2839.2
the netherlands even that

2837.359 --> 2842.0
the big money and [ __ ]

2839.2 --> 2844.5589999999997
and there was like oh

2842.0 --> 2846.8
the first [ __ ] and started about

2844.559 --> 2849.76
global war or like climate change and

2846.8 --> 2851.76
carbon credits and i was like yeah

2849.76 --> 2853.6800000000003
why don't we just

2851.76 --> 2855.3590000000004
use

2853.68 --> 2858.0
like why don't we

2855.359 --> 2862.0789999999997
change all fuel

2858.0 --> 2864.119
from like airliners into hydrogen

2862.079 --> 2866.1600000000003
everything like make it purely

2864.119 --> 2868.88
hydrogen-based fuel

2866.16 --> 2872.48
had no idea yet about like vacuum engine

2868.88 --> 2874.2400000000002
technology would would have already been

2872.48 --> 2876.48
basically standardized i didn't know

2874.24 --> 2879.2799999999997
about that yet i hadn't really caught on

2876.48 --> 2881.44
to that like the weight and all that

2879.28 --> 2885.079
that was like hydrogen fuel

2881.44 --> 2885.079
just do it hydrogen

2887.04 --> 2892.72
right there's no not going to be any

2888.96 --> 2892.7200000000003
trails it's going to be super clean

2896.0 --> 2902.48
and at this point i'd say combine it

2899.28 --> 2905.0400000000004
right do the the vacuum engine thing

2902.48 --> 2907.839
and use hydrogen

2905.04 --> 2910.64
for the startup right there's still

2907.839 --> 2912.7999999999997
allegedly some

2910.64 --> 2914.7999999999997
typical fuel being used to basically

2912.8 --> 2916.559
fire up the engine and then once it gets

2914.8 --> 2918.8
going the vacuum

2916.559 --> 2920.7200000000003
process keeps it

2918.8 --> 2922.48
keeps it stable but you have to still

2920.72 --> 2925.9199999999996
fire it up

2922.48 --> 2929.839
so use hydrogen for that

2925.92 --> 2929.839
super super clean plates

2937.2 --> 2943.359
right those electric cars it's such

2940.16 --> 2945.92
[ __ ] i mean

2943.359 --> 2948.16
it's nice to have some potential

2945.92 --> 2950.96
electric backup

2948.16 --> 2955.1189999999997
right that you could do that

2950.96 --> 2957.2
but like full full electric engines

2955.119 --> 2960.96
without any

2957.2 --> 2962.0
like backup fuel system

2960.96 --> 2965.04
that's

2962.0 --> 2967.68
in my opinion quite idiotic in that

2965.04 --> 2969.2
sense i think hybrids were pretty good

2967.68 --> 2971.52
idea

2969.2 --> 2973.2799999999997
it's just that there's a lot of

2971.52 --> 2976.079
improvement and refinement in the

2973.28 --> 2978.559
engineering to be figured out concerning

2976.079 --> 2981.04
that right and but instead they seem to

2978.559 --> 2982.96
just go for a full electric this is a

2981.04 --> 2984.4
bad idea

2982.96 --> 2987.2
it's gonna stay

2984.4 --> 2990.48
a bad idea you get it

2987.2 --> 2993.359
like i think that the original

2990.48 --> 2995.52
envisioners of let's go electric

2993.359 --> 2997.5989999999997
that they thought that

2995.52 --> 2999.92
well yeah there's a lot of extra

2997.599 --> 3001.3590000000004
electricity that is basically required

2999.92 --> 3003.04
to charge

3001.359 --> 3005.2799999999997
all these cars so it's going to cost

3003.04 --> 3007.119
more energy at the start i think that

3005.28 --> 3010.0
they thought

3007.119 --> 3012.2400000000002
that through technological development

3010.0 --> 3014.64
they could size down the amount of

3012.24 --> 3017.5989999999997
electricity would actually require to

3014.64 --> 3017.5989999999997
keep them going

3017.92 --> 3023.2000000000003
and i think

3019.44 --> 3025.92
that they highly overestimated

3023.2 --> 3028.5589999999997
the amount that they could over time

3025.92 --> 3029.839
actually downsize the electric intake of

3028.559 --> 3032.2400000000002
this

3029.839 --> 3035.359
and i think that they overestimated this

3032.24 --> 3037.5989999999997
so much that it effectively completely

3035.359 --> 3040.5989999999997
nullified any

3037.599 --> 3040.599
original

3040.88 --> 3046.8
vision they had for it

3043.68 --> 3048.24
it's never going to effectively replace

3046.8 --> 3050.2400000000002
fuel cars

3048.24 --> 3055.839
never

3050.24 --> 3055.839
but there is some room for it

3059.92 --> 3064.559
but yeah the thing is because yeah if

3062.8 --> 3066.6400000000003
you look just look at it like this like

3064.559 --> 3068.88
oh electric cars oh they consume more

3066.64 --> 3071.44
electricity oh we can refine the

3068.88 --> 3074.079
technology and then we'll cost less yeah

3071.44 --> 3077.359
you know what else is out there that you

3074.079 --> 3081.119
could do the same thing too

3077.359 --> 3084.0789999999997
fuel engine cars yeah

3081.119 --> 3086.48
the amount of actual fuel

3084.079 --> 3088.1600000000003
that they need to have the same

3086.48 --> 3092.079
performance

3088.16 --> 3094.839
is also being improved greatly it has

3092.079 --> 3098.319
been for like 60 years or

3094.839 --> 3098.319
more yeah

3099.359 --> 3105.359
so at this point electric cars are

3101.599 --> 3107.2000000000003
almost gaslighting to the public like oh

3105.359 --> 3110.16
we have to do it

3107.2 --> 3114.48
we have to do it yeah yeah but fuel cars

3110.16 --> 3116.72
are actually getting really efficient

3114.48 --> 3120.64
like more efficient

3116.72 --> 3122.16
and they can be even more efficient

3120.64 --> 3125.2799999999997
and fuel

3122.16 --> 3127.68
like that can even be improved like i'm

3125.28 --> 3130.48
fairly certain because now fuel

3127.68 --> 3132.3999999999996
does kind of like rot over time it just

3130.48 --> 3135.359
chemically changes it doesn't work

3132.4 --> 3139.2000000000003
anymore if you like have it processed

3135.359 --> 3141.52
laying around for too long

3139.2 --> 3144.0789999999997
i think that could even be

3141.52 --> 3146.24
improved upon

3144.079 --> 3149.28
so there's a lot of

3146.24 --> 3152.16
development dynamics still left for

3149.28 --> 3154.079
what's now falsely known as fossil fuels

3152.16 --> 3155.359
has nothing to do with fossils with with

3154.079 --> 3157.04
oil

3155.359 --> 3159.2
and natural gas

3157.04 --> 3162.0
there's a lot of development room and it

3159.2 --> 3164.72
can be made extremely efficient also oil

3162.0 --> 3168.4
is a is a self-replenishing

3164.72 --> 3172.0789999999997
source it doesn't run out it probably

3168.4 --> 3173.359
will never run out it could over exhaust

3172.079 --> 3175.6800000000003
and then just

3173.359 --> 3179.44
yeah you don't have enough

3175.68 --> 3182.3999999999996
because you're using way too much

3179.44 --> 3185.119
but it is self-replenishing right it's

3182.4 --> 3187.839
one of the few

3185.119 --> 3189.839
energy sources we have

3187.839 --> 3193.2
from within combustion that is just

3189.839 --> 3193.2
provably replenishing

3193.44 --> 3195.839
right

3207.76 --> 3210.7200000000003
oh my god

3211.52 --> 3214.319
derp alerts

3214.72 --> 3220.3999999999996
electric bus flow up

3217.76 --> 3223.8
blow up look like a three-way flame

3220.4 --> 3223.8
throw jesus

3224.88 --> 3230.2400000000002
yeah well that's what happens when you

3226.559 --> 3233.0400000000004
have really big batteries

3230.24 --> 3234.4799999999996
and then they like over

3233.04 --> 3236.96
burden like

3234.48 --> 3238.319
the amount of electric drain becomes too

3236.96 --> 3240.8
much

3238.319 --> 3243.2
yeah they can blow up it's it's super

3240.8 --> 3244.48
potentially super dangerous right that's

3243.2 --> 3247.9199999999996
why

3244.48 --> 3249.28
you don't want your batteries oversized

3247.92 --> 3252.4
right that's why

3249.28 --> 3254.6400000000003
electric should be support

3252.4 --> 3256.559
i mean

3254.64 --> 3259.52
yeah we're all like oh

3256.559 --> 3261.599
action movies from the 80s oh you fire

3259.52 --> 3264.0
like the last action area of fire at the

3261.599 --> 3266.1600000000003
gas tank boom boom boom and explodes

3264.0 --> 3267.76
right yeah guess what that actually

3266.16 --> 3270.48
happens with

3267.76 --> 3272.079
doesn't happen with fuel it never does

3270.48 --> 3274.559
like you actually have to have some kind

3272.079 --> 3277.2000000000003
of explosive

3274.559 --> 3280.0
combustion yeah fight some fire or

3277.2 --> 3283.04
detonation thing to even ignite the fuel

3280.0 --> 3284.799
and then might still not happen

3283.04 --> 3286.5589999999997
you really have to set the car on fire

3284.799 --> 3288.72
for the fuel to ignite right if you

3286.559 --> 3290.079
shoot it doesn't happen

3288.72 --> 3291.52
well

3290.079 --> 3294.88
car batteries

3291.52 --> 3297.68
yeah sometimes they literally explode in

3294.88 --> 3299.599
a fireball and if you're unlucky

3297.68 --> 3301.9199999999996
you're in the car while it happens and

3299.599 --> 3304.88
you become incinerated

3301.92 --> 3309.28
it's quite a horrible fade

3304.88 --> 3311.28
yeah that never happens with fuel cars

3309.28 --> 3315.6800000000003
ever

3311.28 --> 3315.6800000000003
that doesn't happen with fuel cars

3316.96 --> 3322.16
oil yeah oil does replenish yes it does

3320.64 --> 3324.0789999999997
billy rapola

3322.16 --> 3327.2
you're very ill informed

3324.079 --> 3330.88
oil yeah does replenish

3327.2 --> 3333.359
oil wells replenish they fill back up

3330.88 --> 3334.559
that was known

3333.359 --> 3337.68
even

3334.559 --> 3340.0
in the 19th century

3337.68 --> 3340.0
yeah

3340.48 --> 3345.2
that fact

3341.92 --> 3348.96
that oil well wells replenish

3345.2 --> 3351.5989999999997
has been known for over a hundred years

3348.96 --> 3352.599
or more than a hundred years

3351.599 --> 3355.92
maybe

3352.599 --> 3355.92
150 years

3356.079 --> 3360.559
what opportunities do we have yeah well

3358.24 --> 3362.8799999999997
evidence do i have it's very simple look

3360.559 --> 3364.7200000000003
in the business records this is old [ __ ]

3362.88 --> 3367.119
you'll want to act you you're probably

3364.72 --> 3368.72
not gonna do it i wouldn't do it right

3367.119 --> 3370.2400000000002
because i'm very certain that this is

3368.72 --> 3372.48
the case

3370.24 --> 3375.04
i have enough evidence to convince

3372.48 --> 3375.04
myself

3375.359 --> 3379.2799999999997
that because i've heard other people

3377.119 --> 3381.359
talk about it that did do deep research

3379.28 --> 3383.44
and they did show document yeah i don't

3381.359 --> 3384.24
have the links anymore

3383.44 --> 3386.64
yeah

3384.24 --> 3390.52
i have too much information to keep

3386.64 --> 3390.52
track of all the links

3390.96 --> 3395.839
but i heard that oil wells would become

3394.16 --> 3398.799
shut down because literally they

3395.839 --> 3401.68
couldn't get anything out of it anymore

3398.799 --> 3403.119
then they wait what is it

3401.68 --> 3406.8799999999997
20 years

3403.119 --> 3409.359
50 years go back try it out it's already

3406.88 --> 3414.48
weird that they'd go back and try it out

3409.359 --> 3414.48
why would they do that unless they knew

3414.88 --> 3419.44
yeah

3415.92 --> 3422.319
don't think that oil was only used first

3419.44 --> 3423.44
in the in the 19th century or something

3422.319 --> 3426.48
yeah

3423.44 --> 3428.319
oil has been a utility

3426.48 --> 3430.0
even in roman times

3428.319 --> 3431.68
yeah they just didn't turn it into

3430.0 --> 3434.24
petroleum

3431.68 --> 3437.1189999999997
they didn't crack it with refineries but

3434.24 --> 3439.7599999999998
they used it oh yes they did so they

3437.119 --> 3441.04
pumped it up too in their own ways and

3439.76 --> 3443.2000000000003
quite certain

3441.04 --> 3444.48
they would have found ways

3443.2 --> 3446.5589999999997
to deal with it

3444.48 --> 3449.04
they would have had wells

3446.559 --> 3451.0400000000004
and they would probably stop

3449.04 --> 3453.2
yielding at some point

3451.04 --> 3455.2799999999997
and they'd leave it come back

3453.2 --> 3458.48
and it's filled back up

3455.28 --> 3462.6400000000003
so yeah oil drillers oh pump is dead

3458.48 --> 3463.839
okay move on to the other pumps right

3462.64 --> 3466.24
and then

3463.839 --> 3468.16
you keep it you don't sell it you keep

3466.24 --> 3470.3999999999996
it and then you wait

3468.16 --> 3472.0
for a quite a few times you check it

3470.4 --> 3474.2400000000002
periodically and guess what at some

3472.0 --> 3477.76
point oh look there's oil in it again

3474.24 --> 3477.7599999999998
it's filling back up awesome

3477.92 --> 3482.96
yeah that's a fact

3480.079 --> 3485.04
that's like historically recorded fact

3482.96 --> 3486.4
in business records of

3485.04 --> 3488.24
oil drill

3486.4 --> 3490.079
owners

3488.24 --> 3492.799
yeah

3490.079 --> 3496.44
all your rig owners they know that

3492.799 --> 3496.44
they know that historically

3500.15 --> 3503.55
[Music]

3504.16 --> 3508.5589999999997
yeah i'm not good at no returning yeah

3506.48 --> 3510.72
well if you don't want to know if you're

3508.559 --> 3513.3590000000004
just here to say

3510.72 --> 3514.24
now let go [ __ ] yourself and [ __ ] off

3513.359 --> 3517.04
then

3514.24 --> 3520.3999999999996
yeah i know this is true

3517.04 --> 3520.4
i trust it is true

3523.04 --> 3527.2799999999997
do your own research

3525.44 --> 3530.48
huh

3527.28 --> 3533.0400000000004
no it's a new thing do your own research

3530.48 --> 3535.599
i mean it's never been said before but

3533.04 --> 3538.0
now it has a special meaning do your own

3535.599 --> 3540.4
[ __ ] research

3538.0 --> 3543.44
yeah i did my own research i didn't

3540.4 --> 3546.64
write a book about it just so i can

3543.44 --> 3548.799
entertain some stupid ass troll in chat

3546.64 --> 3551.68
that refuses to do their own research

3548.799 --> 3554.24
yeah i didn't specifically write a book

3551.68 --> 3558.839
just because you're too [ __ ] lazy to

3554.24 --> 3558.839
find out for yourself you ass

3562.799 --> 3567.44
don't tell me

3564.72 --> 3567.4399999999996
to calm down

3568.0 --> 3572.799
newcomer first thing in chat shut your

[ __ ] mouth

3572.799 --> 3577.2
if you're a newcomer in chat you shut

3575.119 --> 3579.76
your [ __ ] mouth

3577.2 --> 3581.5989999999997

all right let's uh

3634.799 --> 3640.7599999999998
let's clean out these derps done with

3652.96 --> 3656.839
it's that steamy traveler

3659.599 --> 3662.1600000000003
oh cool

3664.319 --> 3666.5589999999997
huh

3669.76 --> 3674.48
well there you go

i thank you for that steamy traveler

3677.52 --> 3683.04
thank you for that link

3679.599 --> 3685.44
yeah there you go fact it's fact you got

3683.04 --> 3688.0
it you [ __ ] art it's fact oil

3685.44 --> 3690.96
replenishes it's fact

3688.0 --> 3692.319
fact fact fact fact

3690.96 --> 3695.599
yeah

3692.319 --> 3699.5589999999997
it's not gonna run out you understand

3695.599 --> 3699.559
it's not gonna run out

3712.64 --> 3715.44
a little crooked

3770.4 --> 3774.799
okay

3772.48 --> 3774.799
weird

3779.359 --> 3784.0789999999997
yeah i guess sound just sweet switched

3781.92 --> 3786.48
off out of nowhere i didn't even hear a

3784.079 --> 3786.48
blink

3787.2 --> 3791.52
anyway

3788.24 --> 3791.52
we still got half an hour

3794.16 --> 3797.839
talked about a whole bunch of things

3802.799 --> 3810.2
i had a whole bunch of links

3805.52 --> 3810.2
hope everybody's gonna enjoy that

3818.0 --> 3821.839
huh can't make diesel without making

3820.24 --> 3825.839
petrol

3821.839 --> 3825.839
this is a byproduct really

3826.559 --> 3832.1600000000003
yeah dude oil refinement is like a very

3830.559 --> 3835.039
it's like a whole department of

3832.16 --> 3838.0389999999998
chemistry on its own

3835.039 --> 3838.039
dude

3838.559 --> 3843.28
and there is a need or more development

3841.839 --> 3844.96
too because

3843.28 --> 3848.4
in the end

3844.96 --> 3850.48
there are environmental concerns still

3848.4 --> 3853.039
right it's just that oh the alternative

3850.48 --> 3855.76
is old everybody just starving and

3853.039 --> 3857.92
freezing to death at winter and oh yes

3855.76 --> 3860.88
yes oh that's the solution just not

3857.92 --> 3864.839
using anything no it's not

3860.88 --> 3867.76
right oil is going to be very important

3864.839 --> 3870.319
however there's chemical

3867.76 --> 3873.6800000000003
byproducts

3870.319 --> 3876.4
and they're stacking up over time

3873.68 --> 3877.68
and that's a big problem

3876.4 --> 3879.76
like

3877.68 --> 3881.839
they really don't know what to do with

3879.76 --> 3881.8390000000004
it

3882.48 --> 3886.799
it's like pure chemical waste

3885.92 --> 3889.039
and

3886.799 --> 3890.16
it is a systemic problem and there needs

3889.039 --> 3892.7200000000003
to be

3890.16 --> 3895.359
an ingenious

3892.72 --> 3898.64
chemical solution for it it needs to be

3895.359 --> 3899.68
figured out how you can transform that

3898.64 --> 3902.4
waste

3899.68 --> 3905.9199999999996
into or at least neutralize it like

3902.4 --> 3905.92
actually neutralize it

3906.72 --> 3911.0389999999998
and that's very difficult one it's it's

3908.88 --> 3912.0
a mind bender

3911.039 --> 3914.48
i've

3912.0 --> 3915.599
had ideas about it even a very long time

3914.48 --> 3918.64
ago

3915.599 --> 3920.799
that would require some very serious

3918.64 --> 3922.96
technology

3920.799 --> 3925.28
it might be doable it might already

3922.96 --> 3927.839
exist

3925.28 --> 3929.3590000000004
right a transformer a material

3927.839 --> 3931.68
transformer

3929.359 --> 3934.0
where you basically use extreme high

3931.68 --> 3937.0389999999998
voltage electricity

3934.0 --> 3940.079
to rearrange

3937.039 --> 3942.3190000000004
like the molecular nature of a substance

3940.079 --> 3942.319
right

3943.44 --> 3947.68
transmutation

3945.44 --> 3949.28
it exists

3947.68 --> 3953.1189999999997
could it be used

3949.28 --> 3955.28
on waste oil waste product and actually

3953.119 --> 3958.48
make it so that it's at least not going

3955.28 --> 3958.48
to be such a hazard

3960.0 --> 3965.28
i think it's definitely worth

3962.96 --> 3966.799
researching i mean

3965.28 --> 3969.8390000000004
how big

3966.799 --> 3973.28
a toxic waste field

3969.839 --> 3975.52
how many big toxic waste storage fields

3973.28 --> 3977.44
of this garbage do you want to build up

3975.52 --> 3979.28
over time right

3977.44 --> 3982.4
i mean at some point it's going to be so

3979.28 --> 3984.96
big that if just one big disaster and

3982.4 --> 3988.4
certainly like entire continents are

3984.96 --> 3989.28
just drenched in pure deadly poison

3988.4 --> 3991.039
right

3989.28 --> 3993.119
you don't want to let it get to that

3991.039 --> 3994.3190000000004
point

3993.119 --> 3997.039
so

3994.319 --> 3999.839
my solution would be don't stop using

3997.039 --> 4002.7200000000003
oil although don't overdo it right until

3999.839 --> 4005.52
the problem is solved instead figure out

4002.72 --> 4007.1189999999997
how to chemically

4005.52 --> 4010.799
neutralize

4007.119 --> 4010.799
the toxic waste product

4011.52 --> 4014.079
dig deep

4017.839 --> 4021.16
this guy

4028.079 --> 4032.2400000000002
oh tectonic moves

4029.5 --> 4034.559
[Music]

4032.24 --> 4037.2
tectonic [ __ ]

4034.559 --> 4039.44
who the [ __ ] gives a [ __ ] of moving oil

4037.2 --> 4040.96
around oil wells

4039.44 --> 4041.839
replenish

4040.96 --> 4043.68
yeah

4041.839 --> 4046.0
not sporadically

4043.68 --> 4048.24
it's not oh one just decides to

4046.0 --> 4053.2
replenish no

4048.24 --> 4053.2
a lot of oil wells replenish

4076.16 --> 4078.3999999999996
what

4082.16 --> 4087.7599999999998
oh right

4084.88 --> 4087.76
yes they know

4088.559 --> 4091.559
god

4099.12 --> 4104.159
you're just paraphrasing it now you're

4101.199 --> 4105.5199999999995
emphasizing on some heliocentric insert

4104.159 --> 4107.2789999999995
[ __ ]

4105.52 --> 4109.6
that's what you're doing

4107.279 --> 4109.6
yeah

4109.839 --> 4113.6
tectonic plates are a concept

4115.359 --> 4118.4800000000005
there's

4116.48 --> 4119.919999999999
pressure

4118.48 --> 4122.48
lines

4119.92 --> 4124.4
appearance lisa it's apparently

4122.48 --> 4128.159
measurable right and this has been

4124.4 --> 4130.879999999999
modeled modeled not actually proven into

4128.159 --> 4132.96
the concept of tectonic plates

4130.88 --> 4135.6
floating on

4132.96 --> 4137.52
a liquid molten iron core

4135.6 --> 4139.6
that's fiction yeah sure they're

4137.52 --> 4141.92
friction points they're points where

4139.6 --> 4143.839
some it's like

4141.92 --> 4146.319
pushing

4143.839 --> 4149.199
apparently there's more pressure there

4146.319 --> 4151.759
right and land shifts and all that that

4149.199 --> 4153.5199999999995
doesn't however prove tectonic plates no

4151.759 --> 4155.679
matter how much

4153.52 --> 4156.719
you can reinforce that model in your

4155.679 --> 4160.88
mind

4156.719 --> 4163.6
it doesn't actually prove that

4160.88 --> 4167.279
and there's no real proof of tectonic

4163.6 --> 4169.839
plate shifts either where just entire

4167.279 --> 4173.88
regions are suggested oh look

4169.839 --> 4173.88
this was there now it's here

4177.44 --> 4181.919999999999
i mean things might move apart

4180.4 --> 4184.4
somewhat

4181.92 --> 4187.04
they don't migrate halfway across the

4184.4 --> 4189.92
world across the realm that's completely

4187.04 --> 4191.679
ridiculous so i don't know

4189.92 --> 4193.12
like how that happens but it's not

4191.679 --> 4196.0
plates

4193.12 --> 4196.0
not for certain

4196.32 --> 4201.84
it's not floating on anything

4199.04 --> 4204.32
so we reject steamy artist no no because

4201.84 --> 4206.400000000001
of the conclusion that was drawn yeah

4204.32 --> 4208.96
the conclusion is not oh look tectonic

4206.4 --> 4213.36
plates are doing something that's the

4208.96 --> 4215.92
speculation [ __ ] heliocentric side

4213.36 --> 4218.96
to make the baller squirt he had to

4215.92 --> 4221.679
reinforce the religion to be all science

4218.96 --> 4224.159
oh we know so much yeah

4221.679 --> 4227.52
no the actual article is hey look here's

4224.159 --> 4230.48
an oil well it replenished

4227.52 --> 4233.120000000001
here's why we think it replenished yeah

4230.48 --> 4236.32
no the fact is it replenished

4233.12 --> 4238.88
this it's it's a demonstrable fact yeah

4236.32 --> 4240.4
that's the part that's important the

4238.88 --> 4243.36
rest is all

4240.4 --> 4243.36
speculation

4244.56 --> 4248.0
do you want to get banned hey [ __ ]

4246.48 --> 4249.5199999999995
you want to get banned

4248.0 --> 4252.48
you want to get banned

4249.52 --> 4254.080000000001
c quake huh

4252.48 --> 4256.08
are you here to squirt over your

4254.08 --> 4259.28
religion

4256.08 --> 4261.92
are you an anti-flat earther

4259.28 --> 4264.88
okay you beat me to that kevlar

4261.92 --> 4264.88
didn't need to do that

4266.64 --> 4270.0
to appreciate if you didn't time out

4268.64 --> 4273.64
people that i'm in the middle of a

4270.0 --> 4273.64
conversation with

4298.08 --> 4301.08
um

4305.44 --> 4308.96
sorry not sorry yeah well kev

4309.04 --> 4312.239
please don't do that again

4313.28 --> 4319.04
i will have to take your wrench away if

4315.199 --> 4321.678999999999
you do that again please don't

4319.04 --> 4323.76
i mean yeah it's an annoying troll i get

4321.679 --> 4326.76
it but i was in the conversation with

4323.76 --> 4326.76
him

4339.28 --> 4342.28
hmm

4345.12 --> 4349.84
cool george sanford interesting so you

4347.28 --> 4352.5599999999995
say that they put something down there

4349.84 --> 4356.32
well maybe they're just pumping

4352.56 --> 4359.84
a load of the bacteria goo

4356.32 --> 4362.48
right maybe dude maybe oil drillers

4359.84 --> 4364.8
like they have a secret craft i wouldn't

4362.48 --> 4368.5599999999995
be surprised if they just

4364.8 --> 4370.96
like actually secretly know

4368.56 --> 4372.719
like yeah it's bacteria oh look yeah we

4370.96 --> 4375.44
have it like

4372.719 --> 4377.44
we have somebody that actually breeds

4375.44 --> 4379.839999999999
that bacteria

4377.44 --> 4382.08
and then oh you want an oil well

4379.84 --> 4384.56
this is how you do it

4382.08 --> 4387.679
right you find a place where there's

4384.56 --> 4390.080000000001
already signs of oil material and you

4387.679 --> 4392.4800000000005
pour this bacteria stuff down there you

4390.08 --> 4394.32
pour down the black goo

4392.48 --> 4396.718999999999
and then guess what it's gonna they're

4394.32 --> 4398.4
gonna thrive and they're gonna like

4396.719 --> 4401.44
create oil yeah

4398.4 --> 4403.44
it could be just a secret kept secret

4401.44 --> 4405.759999999999
known

4403.44 --> 4406.799999999999
fact

4405.76 --> 4408.8
like

4406.8 --> 4412.08
smiths would have all have all these

4408.8 --> 4415.679
secret metallurgy tricks that they will

4412.08 --> 4418.5599999999995
keep in the craft right

4415.679 --> 4420.8
oil drillers might have that type those

4418.56 --> 4422.88
types of secrets too i've never heard of

4420.8 --> 4424.8
it before but i'm not surprised if they

4422.88 --> 4427.8
would do something like that george

4424.8 --> 4427.8
sanford

4434.08 --> 4437.96
hey seeking star wars

4442.0 --> 4448.8
and not what they call fracking right

4444.08 --> 4452.4
it's not fracking fracking is ridiculous

4448.8 --> 4455.400000000001
fracking might even actually destroy

4452.4 --> 4455.4
oil

4459.92 --> 4463.1990000000005
on the long run that is

4464.64 --> 4469.68
it's certainly not good for the ground

4466.719 --> 4472.829
that's for sure

4469.68 --> 4472.829000000001
[Music]

4476.43 --> 4482.159000000001
[Music]

4478.96 --> 4483.44
isn't fracking for gas

4482.159 --> 4486.48
is it

4483.44 --> 4487.44
no i don't think so

4486.48 --> 4491.04
maybe

4487.44 --> 4491.04
maybe it's for both

4492.159 --> 4495.48
i don't know

4518.88 --> 4522.84
yeah steamy traveler i know she's quick

4521.36 --> 4524.639999999999
c quake was

4522.84 --> 4527.4400000000005
squirting

4524.64 --> 4529.04
over oil replenish because he's probably

4527.44 --> 4531.44
a

4529.04 --> 4534.08
global warming cultist

4531.44 --> 4536.879999999999
so he's just been told no it doesn't it

4534.08 --> 4538.64
runs out it's bad

4536.88 --> 4540.96
so he just probably

4538.64 --> 4544.6
refuses to believe that it is actually a

4540.96 --> 4544.6
renewable resource

4571.84 --> 4574.84
hmm

4587.679 --> 4592.2390000000005
how is the oil replenished

4590.48 --> 4595.759999999999
it's abiotic

4592.239 --> 4599.04
it's bacteria under high pressure

4595.76 --> 4601.84
eating away at the rock

4599.04 --> 4601.84
it's what it is

4602.88 --> 4606.4800000000005
so yeah you take

4604.56 --> 4609.120000000001
take away

4606.48 --> 4612.239
the oil which is bit like the oil

4609.12 --> 4614.48
effectively would be considered like the

4612.239 --> 4616.32
yeah the pus

4614.48 --> 4618.4
the pot rock pus

4616.32 --> 4621.88
sounds gross right but that's basically

4618.4 --> 4621.879999999999
what it is

4623.6 --> 4627.56
liquefied rock

4638.8 --> 4641.92
black goo is

4642.48 --> 4647.5599999999995
well it certainly is black and gooey

4654.64 --> 4658.96
although i think black goo is uh

4657.199 --> 4660.799999999999
associated with something else i think

4658.96 --> 4662.4
that if there is such a thing as black

4660.8 --> 4665.1990000000005
goo

4662.4 --> 4666.799999999999
like black goo is nano technology that's

4665.199 --> 4671.36
what i've heard

4666.8 --> 4671.360000000001
so considerably like uh

4671.76 --> 4676.0
the graphene

4673.679 --> 4677.92
nanographene right

4676.0 --> 4679.76
that could be considered black goo it

4677.92 --> 4681.36
certainly seems to be behaving in

4679.76 --> 4683.76
similar fashion

4681.36 --> 4685.5199999999995
or at least as described so maybe i

4683.76 --> 4687.280000000001
think the black ghoul was described by

4685.52 --> 4688.2390000000005
people and then maybe fictionalized a

4687.28 --> 4690.08
little

4688.239 --> 4691.599999999999
but it might have been

4690.08 --> 4695.84
what some people

4691.6 --> 4695.84
got an early glimpse of which would be

4695.92 --> 4699.28
what is now graphene

4699.36 --> 4703.92
magnetic

4701.12 --> 4706.5599999999995
like magnetically influenceable

4703.92 --> 4709.52
substance

4706.56 --> 4709.52
and it is black

4710.88 --> 4715.1990000000005
so that it's not oil

4713.199 --> 4718.0
there's nothing to directly do with it

4715.199 --> 4721.839999999999
it just has an appearance resemblance to

4718.0 --> 4721.84
certain degree that's it

4739.76 --> 4743.84
who is liquefied rock what really yes

4742.88 --> 4747.4400000000005
really

4743.84 --> 4749.04
they know yes really that's what it is

4747.44 --> 4750.4
yeah

4749.04 --> 4752.239
it's not

4750.4 --> 4756.0
crushed condensed

4752.239 --> 4758.239
dinosaur and plant remnants

4756.0 --> 4760.56
that actually turns into different types

4758.239 --> 4761.36
of things right

4760.56 --> 4764.2390000000005
like

4761.36 --> 4764.239
it's called peat

4764.8 --> 4770.88
like it compacts it it's actually been

4766.96 --> 4773.12
dug up and even used it like

4770.88 --> 4775.52
uh

4773.12 --> 4777.76
to power steam engines and all that in

4775.52 --> 4780.320000000001
the netherlands too right

4777.76 --> 4783.04
that's what actually happens with like

4780.32 --> 4783.679
swamps that get like piled on and then

4783.04 --> 4786.64
it

4783.679 --> 4791.84
pressurizes and it turns

4786.64 --> 4791.84
into that yeah it doesn't turn into oil

4793.44 --> 4798.08
i mean why would you even find oil in

4796.239 --> 4800.08
like super

4798.08 --> 4802.159
long desert

4800.08 --> 4804.32
that is like been desert for a very long

4802.159 --> 4806.638999999999
time oh you think it was once a swamp

4804.32 --> 4807.679
underneath all that and that's how

4806.639 --> 4809.76
really

4807.679 --> 4812.719
no

4809.76 --> 4815.04
why don't you typically find oil

4812.719 --> 4816.8
in swampy regions then

4815.04 --> 4820.639
because you don't

4816.8 --> 4823.04
i mean it's in some

4820.639 --> 4825.28
but you don't typically find it there

4823.04 --> 4825.28
huh

4825.92 --> 4831.04
because it's not

4827.92 --> 4833.6
organic matter

4831.04 --> 4837.199
somehow digested into oil that's not

4833.6 --> 4837.1990000000005
what it is it's rock

4837.52 --> 4845.280000000001
it's liquefied rock eaten

4840.719 --> 4847.76
away by certain unique type of bacteria

4845.28 --> 4850.239
that under high pressure like liquefied

4847.76 --> 4851.52
and turn it into oil sludge that's what

4850.239 --> 4854.0
it is

4851.52 --> 4857.88
there's no organic matter involved in

4854.0 --> 4857.88
that other than the bacteria

4879.28 --> 4882.5599999999995
where does this info come from i heard

4881.84 --> 4886.0
it

4882.56 --> 4886.0
through several people

4887.199 --> 4890.0
throughout my life

4888.4 --> 4891.12
i learned that

4890.0 --> 4893.28
yeah

4891.12 --> 4898.36
the last time somebody actually gave me

4893.28 --> 4898.36
a detailed explanation was uh

4902.239 --> 4907.12
it's the same guy that made that helped

4904.239 --> 4909.5199999999995
me make the uh the 3d image of the

4907.12 --> 4911.92
rectangular looping model what's it's

4909.52 --> 4915.719
got it's been ages

4911.92 --> 4915.719
seen him in a long time

4920.639 --> 4924.4800000000005
but it's not the first time i've heard

4922.32 --> 4928.36
that is it is however the time that it

4924.48 --> 4928.36
really sank in

4929.61 --> 4932.78
[Music]

4935.92 --> 4940.36
i think he should still be there

4944.639 --> 4951.28
no i don't think he has done any videos

4947.44 --> 4951.28
in a long long time

4954.4 --> 4959.839999999999
oh yeah he's still there chris monk

4957.199 --> 4959.839999999999
celie

4961.92 --> 4968.08
i have we had a very elaborate

4965.36 --> 4970.719
letter debate after after show

4968.08 --> 4974.88
conversation with him we had like

4970.719 --> 4977.199
multiple times some of them lasted hours

4974.88 --> 4980.2390000000005
but he's explained that in great detail

4977.199 --> 4982.96
and i think he's like even he was or is

4980.239 --> 4983.839999999999
involved in

4982.96 --> 4987.6
like

4983.84 --> 4989.4400000000005
big ownership of oil stuff

4987.6 --> 4991.280000000001
so

4989.44 --> 4994.839999999999
he said he knew it from his own

4991.28 --> 4994.84
practical experience

5003.52 --> 5008.320000000001
i don't know if he has any videos

5005.44 --> 5008.32
talking about it

5010.48 --> 5015.44
he's mostly just really fascinated by

5013.28 --> 5017.5199999999995
patterns and all that

5015.44 --> 5020.48
is very weird

5017.52 --> 5024.88
inter-dimensional ideas of

5020.48 --> 5028.239
what earth is and all that very trippy

5024.88 --> 5031.6
not super useful when it comes to like

5028.239 --> 5031.599999999999
letters lore or anything

5037.36 --> 5041.679
right but yeah i'm still subscribed to

5039.44 --> 5045.759999999999
the guy so want to check it out and then

5041.679 --> 5045.76
dig through my subscription list

5046.0 --> 5050.639
you can do that right you can see

5048.639 --> 5053.84
other people are subscribed to you can

5050.639 --> 5053.84
see through that list right

5054.32 --> 5059.32
unless you actively hide it which i

5056.32 --> 5059.32
don't

5080.8 --> 5084.400000000001
yes

5081.76 --> 5085.679
yeah trying to forget about the gulf oil

5084.4 --> 5088.679
spill that was

5085.679 --> 5088.679
terrible

5105.77 --> 5108.839000000001
[Music]

5114.88 --> 5118.02
[Music]

5119.6 --> 5122.6
ah

5131.55 --> 5136.679
[Music]

5133.679 --> 5136.679
up

5139.25 --> 5143.12
[Music]

5141.6 --> 5145.4400000000005
yeah the whole thing is ridiculous you

5143.12 --> 5147.599999999999
can start water

5145.44 --> 5150.239
i mean the company bp

5147.6 --> 5153.2390000000005
after that point should not exist

5150.239 --> 5153.239
anymore

5154.0 --> 5158.08
it should have been completely

5156.32 --> 5161.04
like

5158.08 --> 5164.639
confiscated and all the assets sold

5161.04 --> 5166.88
probably to other freaking companies

5164.639 --> 5168.56
just to pay for the damage they caused

5166.88 --> 5171.36
which is yeah

5168.56 --> 5175.04
could not be measured

5171.36 --> 5175.04
they shouldn't exist anymore

5178.239 --> 5184.48
and safe to say that the people that

5180.96 --> 5186.8
managed that decision against all the

5184.48 --> 5189.04
people actually in the field

5186.8 --> 5190.2390000000005
that told them don't do that don't do

5189.04 --> 5191.12
that

5190.239 --> 5194.0
yeah

5191.12 --> 5195.12
the executives that basically force them

5194.0 --> 5198.88
to do that

5195.12 --> 5198.88
should all go to jail

5200.159 --> 5203.48
life sentence

5239.84 --> 5245.12
all right

5241.76 --> 5245.12
no but the thing is right

5245.28 --> 5251.12
when executives are going to like

5248.719 --> 5252.8
or try to force their own

5251.12 --> 5255.599999999999
workers

5252.8 --> 5258.08
to do self-destructive actions then they

5255.6 --> 5260.639
should be able to basically just

5258.08 --> 5264.32
say no and

5260.639 --> 5265.36
like have judicial ground

5264.32 --> 5267.759999999999
to

5265.36 --> 5271.759999999999
yeah to out

5267.76 --> 5274.8
those executives to literally like yes

5271.76 --> 5277.04
oh you want us to do this

5274.8 --> 5280.400000000001
this is what's gonna happen

5277.04 --> 5283.36
yeah you're under arrest

5280.4 --> 5285.44
you just you're just at attempting

5283.36 --> 5287.599999999999
like sabotage

5285.44 --> 5290.0
with like massive damage in the country

5287.6 --> 5292.639
oh you got old financially that works

5290.0 --> 5294.4
yeah well who gives a [ __ ]

5292.639 --> 5297.12
you're literally

5294.4 --> 5300.96
trying to delegate an assault

5297.12 --> 5300.96
a sabotage assault

5302.159 --> 5306.839999999999
they should just be immediately relieved

5305.6 --> 5310.400000000001
of their

5306.84 --> 5310.400000000001
function legally

5311.199 --> 5314.5599999999995
right

5312.4 --> 5318.08
in that sense like people that actually

5314.56 --> 5320.2390000000005
work at a rig and then really know

5318.08 --> 5322.48
how to manage it the dangers that have

5320.239 --> 5325.599999999999
the knowledge in the field they should

5322.48 --> 5329.44
have more autonomy to prevent

5325.6 --> 5333.84
like these demonically deranged freaks

5329.44 --> 5335.919999999999
and their over reliance on money

5333.84 --> 5338.8
to be able to make those types of

5335.92 --> 5341.52
decisions that should be impossible it

5338.8 --> 5344.400000000001
should be impossible for management of

5341.52 --> 5347.360000000001
any mega corporation

5344.4 --> 5349.36
to do that yeah

5347.36 --> 5350.719
there are things

5349.36 --> 5351.599999999999
that money

5350.719 --> 5352.639
should

5351.6 --> 5356.08
never

5352.639 --> 5359.719
ever be able to buy money power should

5356.08 --> 5359.719
not make a difference

5365.12 --> 5368.8
right

5367.36 --> 5370.48
really

5368.8 --> 5373.4400000000005
really

5370.48 --> 5375.44
i mean all those people at those ricks

5373.44 --> 5377.839999999999
like even the security guards should

5375.44 --> 5379.599999999999
have just said like you're under arrest

5377.84 --> 5382.400000000001
we're going to escort you off the

5379.6 --> 5382.400000000001
platform now

5382.8 --> 5389.1990000000005
like you're not going to do that

5385.84 --> 5391.28
and like oh people on the rig oh they're

5389.199 --> 5393.12
all blackmailed whatever the [ __ ] or

5391.28 --> 5396.159
they're all greedy oh we have to do it

5393.12 --> 5399.44
or they're just stupid and weak yeah no

5396.159 --> 5403.879999999999
you don't get to do it

5399.44 --> 5403.879999999999
you're not allowed to do it

5413.199 --> 5415.44
yeah

5415.52 --> 5419.52
thank you for that historical reference

5418.0 --> 5423.04
i guess it's not the first time right it

5419.52 --> 5424.719
makes it even more egregious the people

5423.04 --> 5427.44
that were in control

5424.719 --> 5428.96
that commanded the people on the field

5427.44 --> 5433.32
there to do that

5428.96 --> 5433.32
should have been arrested

5434.96 --> 5437.52
right there

5440.719 --> 5444.4800000000005
and everybody's too weak

5442.719 --> 5447.28
they're just like oh

5444.48 --> 5449.12
we're with a such a powerful company we

5447.28 --> 5451.199
don't want to do anything about it oh oh

5449.12 --> 5455.84
that means you're ruled by satan that

5451.199 --> 5459.5199999999995
means you become potential war criminals

5455.84 --> 5459.52
because of your negligence

5459.6 --> 5464.400000000001
because you let a bunch of freaks that

5461.6 --> 5468.2390000000005
don't know what the [ __ ] they're doing

5464.4 --> 5469.759999999999
do things you know will destroy things

5468.239 --> 5472.5599999999995
without any

5469.76 --> 5475.4400000000005
good reason like they won't even get out

5472.56 --> 5478.400000000001
of it what they want you see

5475.44 --> 5478.4
you did nothing

5478.719 --> 5485.04
all those people that were

5480.639 --> 5485.04
responsible for allowing that to happen

5486.719 --> 5492.2390000000005
they should have all been thrown in that

5489.12 --> 5494.639
blazing oil fire

5492.239 --> 5496.959999999999
you did that you pieces of [ __ ]

5494.639 --> 5498.88
you did that you didn't stop it you

5496.96 --> 5499.92
didn't stop that from happening or you

5498.88 --> 5503.28
thought

5499.92 --> 5505.84
you thought you could maybe maybe no no

5503.28 --> 5508.48
you're

5505.84 --> 5509.679
directly responsible for allowing a

5508.48 --> 5512.678999999999
massive

5509.679 --> 5512.679
atrocity

5519.28 --> 5525.44
right and if you allow yourself to

5521.44 --> 5526.48
become divided and an immoral radar in a

5525.44 --> 5530.0
system

5526.48 --> 5533.28
that you can see will literally

5530.0 --> 5536.96
just destroy just be a pure destruction

5533.28 --> 5539.5199999999995
moment for no damn reason

5536.96 --> 5541.199
then you are responsible it doesn't

5539.52 --> 5543.280000000001
matter

5541.199 --> 5545.44
it doesn't matter what your angle of

5543.28 --> 5546.48
approach is you're in there you're part

5545.44 --> 5548.719
of that

5546.48 --> 5552.159
you've allowed yourself

5548.719 --> 5553.679
to let the fragmentation turn you into a

5552.159 --> 5555.28
immoral

5553.679 --> 5557.76
weak-minded

5555.28 --> 5560.5599999999995
piece of machinery

5557.76 --> 5563.92
and that comes with punishment

5560.56 --> 5565.52
for you allowing that to happen

5563.92 --> 5568.08
to yourself

5565.52 --> 5568.88
and indirectly because of that

5568.08 --> 5571.5199999999995
to

5568.88 --> 5574.400000000001
the entire situation you allowed that to

5571.52 --> 5575.76
happen you're responsible for that

5574.4 --> 5578.96
yeah

5575.76 --> 5581.84
there's [ __ ] excuses everywhere

5578.96 --> 5584.0
so sick of the [ __ ] excuses people

5581.84 --> 5586.32
make and then allow this kind of [ __ ] to

5584.0 --> 5588.8
happen like at some point

5586.32 --> 5591.759999999999
that happens enough like

5588.8 --> 5594.4800000000005
why isn't there a firing squad just like

5591.76 --> 5597.280000000001
oh oh you did that oh there you go

5594.48 --> 5597.28
executed

5597.52 --> 5602.120000000001
you caused this now you die

5602.56 --> 5607.360000000001
because if you don't do that guess

5605.04 --> 5608.8
what's going to happen

5607.36 --> 5610.32
more

5608.8 --> 5611.76
and more

5610.32 --> 5614.5599999999995
and again

5611.76 --> 5617.280000000001
and again and then more people will be

5614.56 --> 5618.96
like why doesn't anything do it

5617.28 --> 5622.639
yeah yeah

5618.96 --> 5625.92
because you're a [ __ ] wussy

5622.639 --> 5629.12
you don't do anything about anything

5625.92 --> 5632.56
you're just waiting you're crying

5629.12 --> 5634.8
for satan who is your [ __ ] master and

5632.56 --> 5637.120000000001

5695.84 --> 5699.1990000000005
building with your dreams

5698.159 --> 5701.679
if you're

5699.199 --> 5704.32
holding on to some stupid little dream

5701.679 --> 5707.119
of your personal growth and personal

5704.32 --> 5708.08
luxuries or whatever the [ __ ] within

5707.119 --> 5710.639
that

5708.08 --> 5714.159
while you allow satan

5710.639 --> 5716.719
to without any reason only because of

5714.159 --> 5718.5599999999995
weakness destroy

5716.719 --> 5722.4800000000005
actual life

5718.56 --> 5728.280000000001
and nature for no damn reason without

5722.48 --> 5728.28
even a positive financial result yeah

5737.119 --> 5740.32
immediately

5739.28 --> 5745.599999999999
action

5740.32 --> 5747.199
don't allow that [ __ ] to happen anymore

5745.6 --> 5749.52
i mean what's the worst that could

5747.199 --> 5749.5199999999995
happen

5749.84 --> 5755.4400000000005
what's the worst that could happen

5752.639 --> 5759.1990000000005
if you literally just like make work of

5755.44 --> 5761.44
it and say no you're not gonna do that

5759.199 --> 5761.44
right

5761.679 --> 5765.119
i mean

5762.88 --> 5766.88
and if like freaking security guards at

5765.119 --> 5768.639
that point are gonna be like oh we have

5766.88 --> 5770.8
to enforce it then they're [ __ ]

5768.639 --> 5772.96
robots they you take their guns and you

5770.8 --> 5776.159000000001
throw them overboard

5772.96 --> 5777.76
like [ __ ] off then

5776.159 --> 5779.679
they're not gonna do that it's gonna

5777.76 --> 5783.360000000001
blow up this is not gonna happen i'm

5779.679 --> 5787.6
going to defend this with my life now

5783.36 --> 5787.599999999999
because i'm not gonna be a wussy

5787.92 --> 5795.76
and be partially responsible because of

5791.199 --> 5799.799999999999
my wussiness for massive destruction for

5795.76 --> 5799.8
no damn reason

5804.8 --> 5808.320000000001
uh anyway

5806.639 --> 5810.159000000001
gotta round out the show the flat earth

5808.32 --> 5813.48
debate's already begun i just kind of

5810.159 --> 5813.48
wanted to

5814.0 --> 5819.36
i want people to be

5816.88 --> 5821.92
that again i want this

5819.36 --> 5825.119
go along to get along

5821.92 --> 5826.4
dream parasiting i want it to end i want

5825.119 --> 5830.159
people to say

5826.4 --> 5833.5199999999995
it doesn't [ __ ] matter what i dream

5830.159 --> 5835.44
there has to be action here right now

5833.52 --> 5838.88
even if that means

5835.44 --> 5842.4
[ __ ] happens to me afterwards you gotta

5838.88 --> 5845.4400000000005
do it you got to do it

5842.4 --> 5847.44
[ __ ] those little connections [ __ ] oh if

5845.44 --> 5850.32
i only don't say anything i might get

5847.44 --> 5851.44
like 20 more [ __ ] you

5850.32 --> 5854.88
yeah

5851.44 --> 5856.638999999999
[ __ ] you you deserve to die for that 20

5854.88 --> 5859.92
yeah if you don't take action you

5856.639 --> 5862.719
deserve to die for that

5859.92 --> 5865.1990000000005
and if people find out that that is the

5862.719 --> 5868.719
reason why you didn't do anything then

5865.199 --> 5871.36
you might just die for it

5868.719 --> 5872.56
so what will you accomplish by not doing

5871.36 --> 5874.48
it

5872.56 --> 5875.92
what will you accomplish nothing but

5874.48 --> 5878.239
destruction

5875.92 --> 5880.56
yeah

5878.239 --> 5886.239
it's better to potentially have your

5880.56 --> 5886.2390000000005
life ruined and prevent a giant disaster

5886.4 --> 5892.159
then to just go along to get along

5889.199 --> 5893.919999999999
because of some delusional framework of

5892.159 --> 5896.4
your own luxuries that you wanted to

5893.92 --> 5898.2390000000005
maintain that are going to be destroyed

5896.4 --> 5900.32
anyway

5898.239 --> 5903.36
you think they're not gonna like

5900.32 --> 5905.759999999999
put you in the responsibility chair

5903.36 --> 5907.199
or a situation like that happening yes

5905.76 --> 5910.0
they will

5907.199 --> 5911.599999999999
it's gonna be over anyway so better just

5910.0 --> 5913.6
jump to that gun

5911.6 --> 5915.92
and ensure

5913.6 --> 5918.159000000001
it's not going to happen

5915.92 --> 5920.56
i don't understand i don't understand

5918.159 --> 5922.879999999999
how all that could have happened i can't

5920.56 --> 5925.4400000000005
understand

5922.88 --> 5927.52
i mean people on oil rigs are usually

5925.44 --> 5928.799999999999
armed

5927.52 --> 5931.040000000001
i mean

5928.8 --> 5933.360000000001
at minimum

5931.04 --> 5936.0
there should have been a shootout before

5933.36 --> 5937.36
they actually did that probably if there

5936.0 --> 5938.639
would have been a shootout then it would

5937.36 --> 5941.04
never happen

5938.639 --> 5943.76
but i don't get it i don't get how that

5941.04 --> 5946.8
happened it's almost like everybody was

5943.76 --> 5948.96
in on it let's destroy everything that

5946.8 --> 5951.119000000001
they're all just seething in satanic

5948.96 --> 5953.6
energy like yes

5951.119 --> 5955.679
yes we're going to blow it up and that

5953.6 --> 5958.2390000000005
the actual engineers are like but that

5955.679 --> 5959.679
doesn't make any sense

5958.239 --> 5961.839999999999
it can't work

5959.679 --> 5961.84
and

5962.639 --> 5966.56
yeah

5963.84 --> 5968.719
why would you then

5966.56 --> 5971.04
why would you then engage

5968.719 --> 5974.0
if you know like these people are

5971.04 --> 5974.0
[ __ ] insane

5975.679 --> 5982.2390000000005
why does it matter if they own anything

5978.84 --> 5984.400000000001
here it's a crime right it's like oh you

5982.239 --> 5987.44
know somebody has like

5984.4 --> 5989.36
weaponry and you know

5987.44 --> 5992.159
that they're gonna literally use it to

5989.36 --> 5993.28
like rob a bank because they told you

5992.159 --> 5997.599999999999
right

5993.28 --> 6000.0
you might have done it before maybe not

5997.6 --> 6003.76
no that's what that situation is they're

6000.0 --> 6005.44
insane they're going to destroy things

6003.76 --> 6006.84
why would you

6005.44 --> 6012.638999999999
go along with

6006.84 --> 6012.639
that why would you not try to stop that

6013.36 --> 6017.839999999999
like

6015.44 --> 6020.08
why didn't they call like interpol or

6017.84 --> 6022.56
something on them

6020.08 --> 6025.199
like you can't do this i'm going to call

6022.56 --> 6028.159000000001
interpol right now

6025.199 --> 6030.799999999999
