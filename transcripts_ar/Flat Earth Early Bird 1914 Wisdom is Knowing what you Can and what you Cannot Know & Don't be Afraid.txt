118.2 --> 123.479

121.84 --> 125.96000000000001
is that the tree

blossom

130.64 --> 136.319

133.599 --> 140.599
overnight so that's really

136.319 --> 140.599
nice both blossoming

141.4 --> 146.68
now right and yeah there's been a bit of

144.4 --> 149.92000000000002
sun here and there but yeah the clouds

146.68 --> 152.68
do Rush by up there and sometimes it's

149.92 --> 157.11999999999998
sunny and other times it's

152.68 --> 157.12
cloudy the sun's coming out right

158.58 --> 161.71900000000002
[Music]

170.519 --> 174.59900000000002
now yeah beautiful day

175.879 --> 180.959
overall not so wet as it was

178.84 --> 183.84
yesterday

180.959 --> 187.44
right hello clear first in chat good to

183.84 --> 193.08
see you fiber oats good to see

187.44 --> 193.07999999999998
you it is Thursday the 4th of April

198.11 --> 201.44000000000003
[Music]

199.4 --> 205.28
2024

201.44 --> 205.28
temperatures 15°

206.879 --> 211.76
C that's kind of nice

214.56 --> 219.48
there's still some rain out there but

216.879 --> 222.48
not over here right

219.48 --> 222.48
now

225.599 --> 232.39999999999998
right so yeah almost managed to get up

229.36 --> 232.4
in time but not

237.879 --> 243.72
entirely so yeah I'm

240.319 --> 243.72
reinitiating my alarm

244.12 --> 252.72
clock also this night I put my telephone

248.4 --> 256.959
basically away from where I normally put

252.72 --> 260.6
it I thought that maybe if I put it

256.959 --> 262.68
away bit further from my head when I go

260.6 --> 267.16
to sleep maybe that will help like the

262.68 --> 270.52
whole apparent ttis thing and it did it

267.16 --> 272.759
definitely did help so this whole thing

270.52 --> 277.19899999999996
might have been building up since since

272.759 --> 277.199
I got the new phone that was

277.68 --> 284.199
4G it might have some influence on

281.32 --> 289.15999999999997
it right so I'm going to keep trying to

284.199 --> 289.16
do that cuz I mean I feel a lot better

290.0 --> 293.96
today

292.12 --> 297.4
right but

293.96 --> 298.63899999999995
still takes some getting used to the

297.4 --> 301.35999999999996
time

298.639 --> 303.639
shift

301.36 --> 305.68
and I did even though I did like really

303.639 --> 306.88
make effort to go to bed early yesterday

305.68 --> 310.039
and I

306.88 --> 313.56
did I really did go to bed earlier for

310.039 --> 317.24
my doing like

313.56 --> 317.24
2:00 and that did

319.24 --> 325.56
help I'm going to keep that up hey Bill

321.72 --> 325.56
night Des sser good to see

326.36 --> 331.639
you all

328.639 --> 331.639
right

340.12 --> 343.329
[Music]

343.56 --> 349.44
right so yeah

344.72 --> 351.36
title for my doing is a bit generic but

349.44 --> 354.4
I mean this is like one of my

351.36 --> 358.199
sayings wisdom is knowing that you can

354.4 --> 358.19899999999996
what you can and what you cannot

358.639 --> 363.8
know

360.28 --> 363.79999999999995
it's not necessarily a

363.84 --> 367.599
subject so I might still change it

366.199 --> 370.12
around depending on what we're going to

367.599 --> 370.12
be talking

387.88 --> 393.15999999999997
about Matt from Quantum of conscious had

390.639 --> 396.44
an interesting little video he has a lot

393.16 --> 399.52000000000004
of interesting videos but yesterday was

396.44 --> 402.08
all about the eclipse fear

399.52 --> 403.08
mongering made some really interesting

402.08 --> 406.08
points

403.08 --> 409.24
there and I thought like yeah I should

406.08 --> 410.84
probably also emphasize that even more

409.24 --> 413.36
it's

410.84 --> 415.84
like the whole Eclipse situation with

413.36 --> 418.52000000000004
the energies in the air there is an

415.84 --> 420.44
opposition that is strength to fear

418.52 --> 422.919
monger

420.44 --> 424.879
to basically make you summon

422.919 --> 427.87899999999996
that or

424.879 --> 427.879
to

429.28 --> 436.15999999999997
uh to harden the cement on whatever

432.639 --> 440.8
you're going to be inserting at this

436.16 --> 440.8
period so no

443.919 --> 449.52
fear it seems like a very important

447.199 --> 453.40000000000003
thing and I'm definitely holding on to

449.52 --> 456.56
to that and Matt so does Matt which is

453.4 --> 457.71999999999997
great I really like that he like figured

456.56 --> 460.72
that

457.72 --> 464.12
out and I I want to like emphasize that

460.72 --> 467.03900000000004
to all my listeners as well that yeah

464.12 --> 470.759
whatever you're going to be anticipating

467.039 --> 470.759
is what you're going to be

471.599 --> 476.599
summoning but not for everybody just for

478.199 --> 483.68
you so so think of it as the

485.319 --> 489.759
Ghostbusters

487.159 --> 493.0
right whatever you think of is coming

489.759 --> 495.47900000000004
out there to destroy you so just don't

493.0 --> 495.479
think of

497.68 --> 503.28000000000003
anything

499.759 --> 503.28000000000003
don't fear

505.159 --> 510.039
anything and and don't try to summon

507.84 --> 512.68
anything like if you try to summon

510.039 --> 515.36
something positive then you're doing

512.68 --> 517.1999999999999
that to destroy something negative

515.36 --> 519.24
potentially you might be having that in

517.2 --> 523.88
your mind well then you also summon the

519.24 --> 526.04
negative so it's basically like

523.88 --> 530.64
just don't do

526.04 --> 530.64
that it's not necessary trust

534.0 --> 541.44
God and try to ignore just all the the

538.2 --> 541.44
fear pouring out there

543.24 --> 548.44
or dispel it I'm doing a little bit of

546.079 --> 551.56
that around INF Wars there's a lot of

548.44 --> 553.8000000000001
fear porn going around which is to be

551.56 --> 555.5999999999999
expected but I mean it's a great time to

553.8 --> 558.1999999999999
just go around and just tell everybody

555.6 --> 560.6800000000001
like yeah yeah yeah oh no nuclear war

558.2 --> 560.6800000000001
yeah that's

561.04 --> 569.5999999999999
fake oh no aliens it's fake oh no meteor

565.959 --> 571.399
yeah it's fake like there's so much beer

569.6 --> 575.6800000000001
porn stuff which you could just point at

571.399 --> 578.12
and just say it's fake like I know it's

575.68 --> 581.12
fake it's not a

578.12 --> 584.6
guess it's

581.12 --> 589.12
fake the fair cell yeah well that the

584.6 --> 589.12
fair cell is just a business strategy of

589.44 --> 595.9200000000001
course but the point is it in this time

593.2 --> 598.32
like with the real energy being

595.92 --> 601.1999999999999
unleashed the eclipse

598.32 --> 603.12
event like there's a thing where it will

601.2 --> 605.519
be

603.12 --> 608.04
cemented so if this is like an

605.519 --> 611.32
opportunity to basically program

608.04 --> 614.5999999999999
yourself in a very positive way and then

611.32 --> 616.8000000000001
you'll probably be able to carry forth

614.6 --> 622.6
that positive programming for a very

616.8 --> 622.5999999999999
long time maybe even there I say

622.7 --> 626.1600000000001
[Music]

624.32 --> 628.32
permanently you're having trouble

626.16 --> 631.92
ignoring the fear

628.32 --> 636.839
porn yeah because it's

631.92 --> 640.7199999999999
exciting I get it right but I mean so is

636.839 --> 642.1600000000001
sugar sugar is very exciting alcohol can

640.72 --> 645.48
be very

642.16 --> 649.88
exciting and so it's all

645.48 --> 649.88
about not being tempted by

651.279 --> 658.24
it right and very important to realize

654.839 --> 661.24
like it's it's really not

658.24 --> 661.24
real

661.399 --> 668.76
I mean some things might happen out

665.12 --> 671.76
there like the whole Baltimore Bridge

668.76 --> 674.88
event and sure if you want to like

671.76 --> 677.88
investigate what's going on I get it but

674.88 --> 681.519
realize that these things are basically

677.88 --> 684.079
like fear Po and entertainment in a way

681.519 --> 685.24
a lot of things are being sprung and

684.079 --> 687.76
you're being

685.24 --> 690.9590000000001
tricked to make you

687.76 --> 693.0
afraid or basic basically to

690.959 --> 696.88
provide the

693.0 --> 700.04
fear that you might have a need for and

696.88 --> 701.88
it's up to you to resist it or to just

700.04 --> 707.16
see it for what it is

701.88 --> 707.16
and not put all this weight onto

711.56 --> 717.3199999999999
it right so I'm not I'm actually not

714.639 --> 719.76
having trouble with it a lot but it's

717.32 --> 724.639
also because I've already

719.76 --> 727.16
way before this made a gesture made it a

724.639 --> 731.48
step I

727.16 --> 735.16
mean I stepped away from bickering and

731.48 --> 735.16
from polarized

737.199 --> 744.4399999999999
Obsession I did that

740.72 --> 746.32
like like what is it one and a half

744.44 --> 749.2790000000001
month

746.32 --> 751.12
ago and at that time already I could

749.279 --> 755.72
feel this type of energy coming and

751.12 --> 755.72
building up was quite overwhelming at

762.12 --> 767.76
first but I've let a lot of it Go and

765.32 --> 769.48
I'm very happy that I did I mean I I do

767.76 --> 772.6
feel like a lot

769.48 --> 775.12
better A lot more stable it's just that

772.6 --> 777.44
the weird tonight's thing did kind of

775.12 --> 777.44
pop

778.12 --> 783.0
up

779.8 --> 783.0
but I'm working on that as

783.639 --> 788.48
well and it is getting better like today

788.6 --> 794.6800000000001
is it's almost to the level where it

791.48 --> 797.24
like has always been which is like kind

794.68 --> 799.6389999999999
of just a bit of insignificant sound in

797.24 --> 802.0790000000001
the background it's not really

799.639 --> 806.24
disruptive so I really hope that I can

802.079 --> 806.2399999999999
continue to basically keep it like

808.12 --> 811.12
that

811.16 --> 814.56
I will do my best for

815.32 --> 818.32
that

819.72 --> 824.6
right so I recommend that that if you're

822.48 --> 828.48
having issues like with the fear porn

824.6 --> 830.6
out there to really more actively try to

828.48 --> 832.48
be conscious

830.6 --> 836.88
about

832.48 --> 840.04
noticing how how it is appealing to you

836.88 --> 842.759
how you want to basically dive into it

840.04 --> 847.199
and then reject

842.759 --> 850.1990000000001
it like see it a bit like a seduction

847.199 --> 851.639
from the devil type of scenario and

850.199 --> 855.519
resist

851.639 --> 857.92
it try to take it as a challenge to

855.519 --> 857.92
resist

858.68 --> 864.7199999999999
it right and it doesn't mean that you

861.519 --> 868.8
can't go gathering information anymore

864.72 --> 871.48
by the way right it's for example like I

868.8 --> 874.12
already have this

871.48 --> 875.24
habit of going through information and

874.12 --> 877.8
then

875.24 --> 879.48
just taking the good things out of it

877.8 --> 883.0
and then as soon as I noticed that it's

879.48 --> 885.519
going off into into pure

883.0 --> 887.959
geometria like there's no more conrete

885.519 --> 890.6
leads or pieces of information then I

887.959 --> 893.16
just going to drop it or entirely

890.6 --> 895.8000000000001
discontinue the video because usually

893.16 --> 901.04
once that starts up it doesn't res

895.8 --> 901.04
Resort back to more concrete information

903.399 --> 909.44
so like as Nathan Oakley typically says

907.44 --> 910.519
you eat the meat spit out the bones it's

909.44 --> 914.24
a good

910.519 --> 917.199
habit to have and very important right

914.24 --> 920.0790000000001
now right so it's not like oh turn off

917.199 --> 921.639
the internet don't watch anything cuz oh

920.079 --> 925.0
there'll be some fear porn in there

921.639 --> 927.9590000000001
you'll get hooked no just still gather

925.0 --> 932.399
information but just like really siphon

927.959 --> 935.92
off the things that are actually useful

932.399 --> 938.8
that you can learn something about or be

935.92 --> 941.04
informed about and then as soon as it

938.8 --> 945.16
just starts to go off

941.04 --> 945.16
into into vagueness

945.36 --> 952.1990000000001
and Superstition

948.279 --> 955.279
basically just let it go in your mind

952.199 --> 957.24
and notice how that is then not

955.279 --> 960.4399999999999
interesting

957.24 --> 963.639
really it's only interesting if you are

960.44 --> 965.44
into the fear kick and it it isn't

963.639 --> 966.9590000000001
really interesting it might be a kick

965.44 --> 969.5600000000001
but it's not interesting it's you're not

966.959 --> 972.4799999999999
going to learn anything from that it's

969.56 --> 972.4799999999999
just going to wind you

976.44 --> 984.0790000000001
up so yeah hopefully that will

979.6 --> 984.0790000000001
help a little bit to all those

984.24 --> 990.92
watching concerning the eclipse

987.92 --> 990.92
event

992.92 --> 998.4799999999999
fear is the mind

995.079 --> 1001.0
killer don't be

998.48 --> 1004.0
addicted don't kill your

1001.0 --> 1004.0
mind

1006.959 --> 1013.2399999999999
like Let The Awakening awake you and

1011.199 --> 1015.7589999999999
don't put try to put it back to sleep

1013.24 --> 1015.759
with with

1017.68 --> 1022.959
fear right

1020.04 --> 1022.959
so let me switch

1040.829 --> 1044.079
[Music]

1045.72 --> 1050.84
browser right so yeah I'm not getting a

1048.559 --> 1050.84
lot of

1051.96 --> 1057.24
responses on my show yesterday I mean it

1055.039 --> 1058.84
it was a bit of a weird idea I've been

1057.24 --> 1061.679
trying to imagine

1058.84 --> 1063.32
like how for example the Irish might

1061.679 --> 1065.6000000000001
respond to everything that I'm saying

1063.32 --> 1068.48
and realizing that there's a good chance

1065.6 --> 1068.48
that they're not

1068.799 --> 1076.9189999999999
really all that happy about an idea of a

1072.44 --> 1076.919
new Kel Christian

1077.84 --> 1080.84
cism

1081.99 --> 1085.19
[Music]

1085.52 --> 1091.24
I've just been thinking about it like

1088.24 --> 1092.84
how how could this idea fit how could it

1091.24 --> 1098.08
be a positive

1092.84 --> 1098.08
influence but it might simply not be

1101.799 --> 1105.799
ready or it might or it might just pop

1104.52 --> 1108.24
up out of

1105.799 --> 1111.1589999999999
nowhere somewhere in the next year or

1108.24 --> 1115.1200000000001
something or afterward and I'd be very

1111.159 --> 1117.5200000000002
excited to see like whoa what is this

1115.12 --> 1122.36
how how are they doing

1117.52 --> 1124.52
that like how is this new Christian

1122.36 --> 1127.9599999999998
religion are they going to have like

1124.52 --> 1131.44
similar pitfalls as

1127.96 --> 1133.64
Catholicism or are they going to just be

1131.44 --> 1137.28
very cultural and

1133.64 --> 1137.2800000000002
interesting or maybe

1137.559 --> 1145.9189999999999
both yeah but I mean it is very arnian

1141.4 --> 1149.48
of me to just have this these strange

1145.919 --> 1149.48
Visions about what could

1150.44 --> 1153.489
[Music]

1162.2 --> 1168.24
be right so I'm yeah I put that out of

1166.28 --> 1169.8799999999999
course on my show yesterday and I think

1168.24 --> 1173.76
I'm just going to kind of leave

1169.88 --> 1173.7600000000002
it just going to leave it

1176.44 --> 1181.679
be also by the way the the saying that I

1180.24 --> 1183.84
that was the primary saying from

1181.679 --> 1186.919
yesterday show apocalypse is Armageddon

1183.84 --> 1188.28
to those living a lie that's going to be

1186.919 --> 1190.96
very

1188.28 --> 1194.1589999999999
blatant you're going to see it you're

1190.96 --> 1194.159
going to see it in certain

1197.64 --> 1200.64
people

1203.24 --> 1208.919
especially like people that are all

1205.52 --> 1211.36
about the WF agenda and all that you're

1208.919 --> 1213.2800000000002
going to start noticing it on them that

1211.36 --> 1215.559
they're going to look different and it's

1213.28 --> 1218.08
going to grow worse and

1215.559 --> 1220.6789999999999
worse example

1218.08 --> 1226.0
was the the Dutch

1220.679 --> 1226.0
king seems to be undergoing that very

1227.64 --> 1230.64
process

1231.6 --> 1236.9599999999998
and in like photos he's been caught in

1234.4 --> 1240.48
recently it just looks like he's just

1236.96 --> 1240.48
drowning under a pile of

1242.52 --> 1245.96
worries more and

1248.48 --> 1255.52
more while his wife is just looking more

1252.24 --> 1255.52
and more like a complete

1257.6 --> 1260.6
psychopath

1286.559 --> 1290.52
anyway yeah

1295.44 --> 1300.799
right so don't be afraid don't live a

1297.52 --> 1304.44
lie and you'll be good

1300.799 --> 1307.08
just be with

1304.44 --> 1311.72
Jesus as they

1307.08 --> 1314.8799999999999
say but don't be don't hold on any value

1311.72 --> 1320.88
on any crazy riddles though just stick

1314.88 --> 1320.88
to the rudimentary basic Spirit of is

1322.88 --> 1328.64
wisdom right I

1324.72 --> 1332.44
mean the real essence of Christ's wisdom

1328.64 --> 1332.44
is really simple in

1342.87 --> 1345.9799999999998
[Music]

1346.08 --> 1351.4399999999998
nature all right also from what I'm

1349.12 --> 1354.12
reading there's a lot of

1351.44 --> 1356.2
development against the whole medical

1354.12 --> 1358.4399999999998
experimentation situation that has

1356.2 --> 1361.88
happened of

1358.44 --> 1364.919
course those years

1361.88 --> 1367.8400000000001
ago and

1364.919 --> 1372.279
like it's really some countries are

1367.84 --> 1375.08
really like now basically starting to

1372.279 --> 1380.44
officially recognize like what has

1375.08 --> 1380.4399999999998
happened like in Austria

1383.919 --> 1391.3600000000001
so that's that's good development it's

1387.88 --> 1391.3600000000001
taking a long time all of

1392.96 --> 1398.0
it but it's happening it's still going

1395.88 --> 1401.44
it's not like getting muffled on the

1398.0 --> 1401.44
carpet anymore so that's

1403.96 --> 1407.44
positive and what's the worst that

1406.2 --> 1409.88
happens we

1407.44 --> 1411.8600000000001
die

1409.88 --> 1414.98
hello

1411.86 --> 1414.9799999999998
[Music]

1434.559 --> 1440.76
clutch it's the worst that can happen we

1437.799 --> 1445.6
die yeah well if that happens it happens

1440.76 --> 1445.6
I mean there's still stuff happening out

1453.76 --> 1459.96
there but I mean it's very unlikely that

1457.919 --> 1463.4
in regions where there's not some kind

1459.96 --> 1466.2
of War situation acutely happening it's

1463.4 --> 1467.919
just very unlikely anything terrible is

1466.2 --> 1469.0
going to happen all of a sudden around

1467.919 --> 1473.2
the world

1469.0 --> 1473.2
like you definitely don't have to fear

1480.96 --> 1484.279
that and

1484.48 --> 1490.2
actually yeah everybody would fear like

1488.159 --> 1493.919
that in a region where it's relatively

1490.2 --> 1497.32
safe you potentially be summoning a new

1493.919 --> 1500.3200000000002
situation that would actually cause more

1497.32 --> 1500.32
damage

1502.6 --> 1507.32
right so just don't fear and dispel the

1504.96 --> 1507.32
fear

1507.919 --> 1514.159
and and and share the information share

1511.559 --> 1517.36
share what is real and what

1514.159 --> 1519.1200000000001
isn't like be more on the nose about it

1517.36 --> 1522.24
people go like oh we're going to get

1519.12 --> 1524.6789999999999
nuked it's like yeah that's fake

1522.24 --> 1527.32
though with full confidence because

1524.679 --> 1529.0
there is no evidence there really

1527.32 --> 1531.279
isn't

1529.0 --> 1533.559
I mean yeah there's going to be or there

1531.279 --> 1536.08
could be very big bombs that are

1533.559 --> 1538.12
delivered through Hypersonic missiles

1536.08 --> 1542.399
things could definitely blow up and

1538.12 --> 1545.6789999999999
there's all kinds of scary type of

1542.399 --> 1548.08
weapons but like suddenly everything

1545.679 --> 1551.159
just blowing up

1548.08 --> 1553.72
no that ain't

1551.159 --> 1555.64
happening I mean the worst that could

1553.72 --> 1558.64
happen in a scenario like that is that

1555.64 --> 1562.039
suddenly military bases around the world

1558.64 --> 1566.0800000000002
just start blowing up all of a sudden

1562.039 --> 1571.1589999999999
like that's if there's anything like a a

1566.08 --> 1573.84
nuclear launch everywhere then that is

1571.159 --> 1577.3600000000001
what's going to blow up not just

1573.84 --> 1577.36
everything there's no

1579.2 --> 1585.64
way right and there won't be like Miles

1582.88 --> 1587.24
and Miles blast radius kind of thing

1585.64 --> 1590.24
there's no

1587.24 --> 1590.24
way

1599.64 --> 1606.5590000000002
right and even with yeah even if like

1602.96 --> 1608.559
fall on war and went all crazy then

1606.559 --> 1610.399
nukes is like the last thing you need to

1608.559 --> 1613.799
worry about it's probably more going to

1610.399 --> 1616.76
be just Su like suicide bombing drone

1613.799 --> 1620.24
squads drone swarms like that is way

1616.76 --> 1620.24
more dangerous

1622.84 --> 1627.52
they're already like testing these

1625.2 --> 1629.799
things out there in war scenarios right

1627.52 --> 1632.36
now and they're pretty damn terrifying

1629.799 --> 1636.6
if you ask

1632.36 --> 1639.8799999999999
me right but nukes no you don't have to

1636.6 --> 1639.8799999999999
worry you really

1643.12 --> 1648.9189999999999
don't it was always meant as a science

1647.159 --> 1651.3200000000002
fiction

1648.919 --> 1654.3600000000001
deterrent something to discourage

1651.32 --> 1657.96
engaging in for war to make it to make

1654.36 --> 1662.559
the price seem higher for engaging in

1657.96 --> 1662.559
Hot War and it served its

1662.679 --> 1670.3990000000001
function

1664.399 --> 1670.399
but it yeah it doesn't work anymore

1674.48 --> 1679.6
really because there's crazy people that

1677.039 --> 1683.399
don't care

1679.6 --> 1683.399
that don't care whether that's real or

1685.44 --> 1691.76
not so hot Wars are

1689.919 --> 1694.3200000000002
happening

1691.76 --> 1697.519
and nukes

1694.32 --> 1700.559
AR so yeah it's kind of like the

1697.519 --> 1704.24
deterrent for you could say that nukes

1700.559 --> 1706.6789999999999
in a way brought world peace in a in a

1704.24 --> 1710.559
very grably

1706.679 --> 1714.6000000000001
way that the idea of nukes did like

1710.559 --> 1719.36
create a hot War deterrent that worked

1714.6 --> 1723.1589999999999
for quite a while but it seems like that

1719.36 --> 1723.1589999999999
period has mostly

1724.96 --> 1731.2
ended and since like technological

1727.919 --> 1732.0800000000002
development for war has developed quite

1731.2 --> 1735.559
a

1732.08 --> 1738.4399999999998
lot since the new

1735.559 --> 1741.719
era everything is different

1738.44 --> 1741.719
[Music]

1746.0 --> 1750.76
and with the internet alongside that I

1749.0 --> 1753.44
think that it's just

1750.76 --> 1755.64
like war is just definitely not

1753.44 --> 1758.48
appealing

1755.64 --> 1762.279
anymore so it's almost like the war

1758.48 --> 1764.24
deterrent of nukes is basically outdated

1762.279 --> 1768.36
now it's not really even necessary even

1764.24 --> 1772.08
if it would work people realize like no

1768.36 --> 1775.84
is it sucks it's [ __ ]

1772.08 --> 1779.12
up you get blown up way too easily these

1775.84 --> 1779.12
days as a

1786.72 --> 1793.6000000000001
soldier right so maybe in that sense

1790.32 --> 1796.76
it's almost back to the World War I type

1793.6 --> 1799.76
of balance where in World War I like

1796.76 --> 1805.2
soldiers just

1799.76 --> 1808.08
thousands and thousands would die for

1805.2 --> 1810.559
nothing it's almost kind of back to that

1808.08 --> 1814.799
it's like the technology has caught on

1810.559 --> 1818.44
once again and so like as a soldier

1814.799 --> 1818.44
it's very high

1818.76 --> 1826.6
risk that makes War very unappealing and

1823.159 --> 1828.88
now like it's all being filmed and dis

1826.6 --> 1832.039
redistributed everywhere people get to

1828.88 --> 1834.96
see how terrible it is in World War I

1832.039 --> 1837.919
nobody get to see

1834.96 --> 1841.44
anything you just went into the meat

1837.919 --> 1844.3600000000001
grinder and nobody would know about

1841.44 --> 1848.6000000000001
it except you got a letter afterward

1844.36 --> 1852.36
like oh your de family member has died

1848.6 --> 1854.6399999999999
in in the Call of Duty Etc and that's it

1852.36 --> 1856.639
you didn't know how that happened it

1854.64 --> 1861.48
only heard that way

1856.639 --> 1861.4799999999998
afterward well now we get to see very

1862.2 --> 1870.919
quickly how it all happen so the

1864.84 --> 1870.9189999999999
deterrent is is quite up front it's all

1872.519 --> 1876.36
there the setting has

1886.919 --> 1889.919
changed

1892.08 --> 1901.76
right nukes are

1894.559 --> 1906.639
fake turns out that a great big big part

1901.76 --> 1909.1589999999999
of the modern medical system is

1906.639 --> 1912.4399999999998
fake

1909.159 --> 1914.88
that's that is probably much more hard

1912.44 --> 1916.679
to to swallow for a whole bunch of

1914.88 --> 1918.3990000000001
people is

1916.679 --> 1921.72
that yeah

1918.399 --> 1923.9189999999999
virus is not existing and that just like

1921.72 --> 1923.919
the

1924.88 --> 1927.88
whole

1928.159 --> 1933.6390000000001
um germ theory is

1931.279 --> 1937.279
basically mostly

1933.639 --> 1938.639
debunk K poate is never applied with

1937.279 --> 1941.12
like anything

1938.639 --> 1944.7199999999998
ever like they don't they don't even

1941.12 --> 1944.7199999999998
test that anymore it's just all

1944.84 --> 1951.08
presupposed

1946.84 --> 1953.399
and we get subjected to Medical

1951.08 --> 1955.9189999999999
experimentation pretty much since the

1953.399 --> 1959.76
beginning of the 20th

1955.919 --> 1962.76
century that comes out of that medical

1959.76 --> 1965.799
industrial complex that's like founded

1962.76 --> 1968.76
by the Rockefeller Foundation originally

1965.799 --> 1971.84
that has all just been there to to take

1968.76 --> 1974.96
away old

1971.84 --> 1977.32
holistic medical practices on how to

1974.96 --> 1979.8400000000001
cure things with herbs and with basic

1977.32 --> 1979.84
things

1982.32 --> 1987.84
and we're facing

1984.32 --> 1990.559
that right there is like in this period

1987.84 --> 1996.08
there's a phase off between

1990.559 --> 1996.08
that Eugenics style medical

1997.679 --> 2001.1200000000001
system and the

2003.44 --> 2009.279
people and it's coming to a

2006.76 --> 2011.799
head

2009.279 --> 2015.399
it's almost like

2011.799 --> 2016.76
a a war on its own between the medical

2015.399 --> 2019.279
system and the

2016.76 --> 2023.96
people that has been happening for quite

2019.279 --> 2023.96
some time and it's really been pretty

2024.639 --> 2028.36
dramatic in the last

2029.32 --> 2035.559
[Music]

2032.399 --> 2036.7199999999998
decade so yeah that could potentially at

2035.559 --> 2039.72
some point

2036.72 --> 2039.72
end

2043.799 --> 2047.8
and in the meantime there's plenty of

2045.559 --> 2051.919
opportunity to basically

2047.8 --> 2054.0
regain the old holistic type of

2051.919 --> 2056.2799999999997
knowledge because there's the internet

2054.0 --> 2058.52
still there's so much opportunity to

2056.28 --> 2063.32
just attain this information you don't

2058.52 --> 2065.44
have to like know about the one wise

2063.32 --> 2068.839
woman in the

2065.44 --> 2071.56
woods and then

2068.839 --> 2074.24
petition with her and then hear her out

2071.56 --> 2079.7999999999997
and then believe it and try to mimic

2074.24 --> 2079.7999999999997
that no like this type of knowledge is

2079.919 --> 2084.879
everywhere getting tested getting

2092.919 --> 2096.1589999999997
spread all

2096.64 --> 2099.64
right

2100.599 --> 2107.079
right but just like the entire

2102.56 --> 2111.04
conception of what disease even

2107.079 --> 2113.52
is is being radically

2111.04 --> 2117.92
tested even through what I do like

2113.52 --> 2121.839
through the whole view of German new

2117.92 --> 2124.32
medicine it's still testing at times but

2121.839 --> 2128.72
I am just very much seeing it more as

2124.32 --> 2133.56
like no bacteria are really just like

2128.72 --> 2136.4399999999996
a part of of the biome a part of just

2133.56 --> 2139.16
the natural function of the

2136.44 --> 2142.4
multicellular

2139.16 --> 2142.3999999999996
beings of

2144.119 --> 2149.6400000000003
us and the idea that you get

2149.76 --> 2156.48
infected by a micro

2153.319 --> 2158.7599999999998
being and that that

2156.48 --> 2162.359
causes the the

2158.76 --> 2162.3590000000004
disease is

2162.92 --> 2169.76
like it's getting

2166.28 --> 2171.88
dispelled I mean I let me emphasize

2169.76 --> 2174.96
again K

2171.88 --> 2177.8
poit isn't being applied it's not

2174.96 --> 2177.8
actually being

2178.0 --> 2183.079
tested right when that should be like

2181.079 --> 2186.5600000000004
the first

2183.079 --> 2188.2400000000002
step in any medical

2186.56 --> 2189.96
procedure

2188.24 --> 2192.56
that relates to

2189.96 --> 2195.76
this that relates to like oh there is a

2192.56 --> 2199.359
disease oh really golate are you are you

2195.76 --> 2203.1600000000003
doing it or oh you got a reading of some

2199.359 --> 2205.56
stuff in the blood oh really so does

2203.16 --> 2209.0
that prove

2205.56 --> 2213.68
that there is an infection going

2209.0 --> 2216.52
on no it doesn't it bypasses

2213.68 --> 2218.44
culate it's just being

2216.52 --> 2220.52
assumed

2218.44 --> 2222.7200000000003
it's being

2220.52 --> 2225.88
presupposed and this is like really

2222.72 --> 2227.72
standing out to me more and more is that

2225.88 --> 2230.599
the medical system

2227.72 --> 2233.04
is is in a way

2230.599 --> 2237.839
fraudulent because they

2233.04 --> 2240.88
don't really undertake the scientific

2237.839 --> 2243.0
steps that are supposedly at the very

2240.88 --> 2245.4
founding of their

2243.0 --> 2246.52
conceptions they don't do it they don't

2245.4 --> 2249.4
do the

2246.52 --> 2252.48
things

2249.4 --> 2252.48
they just presuppose

2252.56 --> 2256.56
it and that needs to

2258.48 --> 2262.599
stop and I really hope that at some

2260.92 --> 2266.8
point there will be

2262.599 --> 2268.92
like an effort from medical people to

2266.8 --> 2272.88
really like go back to the roots and

2268.92 --> 2275.16
just like yeah CP let's let's get this

2272.88 --> 2279.92
over with let's like really figure this

2275.16 --> 2282.92
out once and for all in like a real big

2279.92 --> 2282.92
official

2283.0 --> 2290.8
test like is it infectious like can we

2287.359 --> 2290.7999999999997
prove it can we trace

2294.56 --> 2298.839
it like what actually

2300.119 --> 2305.76
happens and also important like what is

2303.599 --> 2308.96
the the moral

2305.76 --> 2311.6800000000003
condition of a patient

2308.96 --> 2314.0
to not just make it biological and

2311.68 --> 2317.2
ignore the spiritual and

2314.0 --> 2317.2
mental and

2319.52 --> 2324.839
emotional right so yeah lots of

2322.92 --> 2329.8
developments that are still waiting

2324.839 --> 2329.7999999999997
ahead of us in this period of

2330.079 --> 2338.3590000000004
time and for to get all through all of

2334.319 --> 2340.359
that what we need is a clear

2338.359 --> 2343.24
mind

2340.359 --> 2346.4
and to get over fear

2343.24 --> 2348.319
addiction because all these tricks all

2346.4 --> 2351.04
play into Fair

2348.319 --> 2353.96
addiction that's what keeps them around

2351.04 --> 2353.96
that's what keeps

2355.48 --> 2358.92
them being

2359.68 --> 2363.1189999999997
used right they

2364.76 --> 2370.8390000000004
provide because we are fair and that's

2368.119 --> 2373.6400000000003
why they keep being used and so In This

2370.839 --> 2379.44
Very period of the eclipse it could be

2373.64 --> 2381.24
cemented in Let It Go if you let it go

2379.44 --> 2385.44
then

2381.24 --> 2389.52
those fear based lies out

2385.44 --> 2392.04
there are more likely to be resolved and

2389.52 --> 2395.079
go way

2392.04 --> 2399.119
quicker realize that about

2395.079 --> 2404.6800000000003
it you letting it go will

2399.119 --> 2404.6800000000003
contribute collectively into them going

2408.0 --> 2412.52
away I'd say it's worth it it's worth a

2426.319 --> 2429.319
shot

2429.69 --> 2432.7200000000003
[Music]

2430.839 --> 2435.52
right so yeah I hope that was

2432.72 --> 2440.359
interesting first

2435.52 --> 2440.359
segment I feel so much more concentrated

2449.66 --> 2457.359
[Music]

2454.4 --> 2461.319
now all right and in the meantime also

2457.359 --> 2464.72
so the whole Space thing

2461.319 --> 2469.64
right do we really need to get rid of

2464.72 --> 2472.2
it do we really need to like oh space is

2469.64 --> 2474.5989999999997
fake it's all

2472.2 --> 2476.9199999999996
nonsense Earth is flat Earth is flat

2474.599 --> 2480.2400000000002
Earth is

2476.92 --> 2484.28
flat or are there like still things

2480.24 --> 2489.24
about it that are like welcome cuz for

2484.28 --> 2489.2400000000002
example I still enjoy space movies

2489.28 --> 2494.44
I still enjoy that Science

2491.599 --> 2496.48
Fiction it's getting better the science

2494.44 --> 2499.2400000000002
fiction the space stuff is getting

2496.48 --> 2499.2400000000002
better in

2499.4 --> 2506.0
ways right but it is fake

2502.52 --> 2510.079
though so can we just continue

2506.0 --> 2512.76
on knowing it's fake but enjoying it

2510.079 --> 2514.96
it's like look at this modern magical

2512.76 --> 2517.76
fairy tale storytelling

2514.96 --> 2520.359
tradition look at this isn't that

2517.76 --> 2524.88
amazing like it's not

2520.359 --> 2528.16
real but it it's very impressive

2524.88 --> 2531.56
and you might start to think it's real

2528.16 --> 2533.52
again for just a bit until you really

2531.56 --> 2535.44
think about it and then you realize that

2533.52 --> 2539.04
it can't be

2535.44 --> 2543.48
real but should we get rid of it can we

2539.04 --> 2548.68
get rid of it entirely or is it

2543.48 --> 2551.839
just too glorious to fully let go

2548.68 --> 2555.1189999999997
right well we can certainly get rid of

2551.839 --> 2560.44
the fear poor nonsense associated with

2555.119 --> 2564.839
it right we don't have to be afraid of

2560.44 --> 2568.68
some alien gray men coming from another

2564.839 --> 2570.7999999999997
planet to get us although there might

2568.68 --> 2573.2799999999997
interdimensionally still be some issues

2570.8 --> 2574.96
there but I mean that was always there

2573.28 --> 2578.0400000000004
and it's always going to be there it's

2574.96 --> 2580.52
just the form they take

2578.04 --> 2584.7599999999998
we don't have to worry about some meteor

2580.52 --> 2588.44
striking us destroying us oh no right

2584.76 --> 2590.92
all that stuff is like yeah but it's not

2588.44 --> 2594.0
real so you don't have to worry about

2590.92 --> 2595.6800000000003
that but you could still enjoy a science

2594.0 --> 2598.28
fiction

2595.68 --> 2600.96
movie even if it had some of that

2598.28 --> 2603.2400000000002
nonsense like a what if scenario like

2600.96 --> 2604.52
what if a meteor was going to actually

2603.24 --> 2608.1189999999997
destroy

2604.52 --> 2613.319
us what would we do

2608.119 --> 2613.319
how would we go to another place

2614.52 --> 2620.24
right that may still be kind of

2617.4 --> 2623.079
interesting to to watch

2620.24 --> 2625.5989999999997
that but you don't have to worry it'll

2623.079 --> 2625.599
ever be

2627.76 --> 2635.48
real so amidst the the chain dispelling

2633.68 --> 2638.0789999999997
happening through the

2635.48 --> 2641.079
Apocalypse of all the

2638.079 --> 2644.3590000000004
these fears about things that aren't

2641.079 --> 2647.559
actually real I think that outer space

2644.359 --> 2651.92
and all that as a science fiction medium

2647.559 --> 2654.119
still has a long way to go with

2651.92 --> 2658.319
us like the

2654.119 --> 2658.319
story The story's not over

2664.8 --> 2671.319
yet and also the ACT ual hardcore

2668.119 --> 2675.079
Believers that it is real may still be

2671.319 --> 2678.2799999999997
pushed forth for some time like they're

2675.079 --> 2681.1600000000003
not going to easily Let It

2678.28 --> 2683.4
Go like Elon Musk and his rocket

2681.16 --> 2685.319
launches and all all that stuff I think

2683.4 --> 2686.88
that's still going to keep going for

2685.319 --> 2689.44
some

2686.88 --> 2693.52
time because people are just not going

2689.44 --> 2695.7200000000003
to want to let go it's like the quality

2693.52 --> 2699.079
of space movies and all that is just

2695.72 --> 2700.7999999999997
going to be so great is that that's

2699.079 --> 2703.92
going to make it harder for people that

2700.8 --> 2707.319
really believe it to let it go because

2703.92 --> 2709.44
it's like that futurist image of what

2707.319 --> 2711.92
you think could become

2709.44 --> 2713.64
real just becomes more and more

2711.92 --> 2716.2000000000003
beautiful staring you in the face and

2713.64 --> 2720.16
you want it you want to go there you

2716.2 --> 2720.16
can't go there but you can't let it

2724.0 --> 2728.96
go and that'll be there for a while I

2726.68 --> 2728.96
believe

2739.92 --> 2744.76
all right anyway I'm going to turn on my

2742.559 --> 2747.76
coffee and put Illuminati kasan in the

2744.76 --> 2747.76
oven and I'll be right

2755.92 --> 2758.92
back

2785.92 --> 2788.92
for

2815.839 --> 2821.2799999999997
for

2818.24 --> 2821.2799999999997
hope you're all enjoying the

2822.2 --> 2825.64
show if you are don't forget the Rogan

2824.88 --> 2829.7200000000003
it

2825.64 --> 2832.359
up and yeah I can actually use some

2829.72 --> 2832.359
support by

2834.119 --> 2840.88
now so please do donate to my PayPal I

2838.079 --> 2843.6400000000003
don't have a grabler mask to make my

2840.88 --> 2843.6400000000003
agent tell

2845.839 --> 2848.839
you

2854.319 --> 2859.52
hey oh I did actually get some support

2861.68 --> 2868.1189999999997
huh from moio

2864.96 --> 2871.16
Gustavo thank you I just checked I I did

2868.119 --> 2871.1600000000003
have some support that's

2872.0 --> 2877.48
awesome yesterday even thank you very

2875.2 --> 2879.7599999999998
much oh okay

2877.48 --> 2879.76
that's

2896.64 --> 2899.64
cool

2905.76 --> 2908.76
awesome

2919.96 --> 2924.76
oh it's usually the opposite of what

2921.72 --> 2926.68
mainstream says pump and fearce so you

2924.76 --> 2930.5200000000004
know it's opposite yeah yeah I didn't

2926.68 --> 2934.0789999999997
even get to that clutch because main

2930.52 --> 2934.079
main stream

2935.72 --> 2942.8799999999997
media it's so

2938.92 --> 2945.7200000000003
stupid like it's not even like catching

2942.88 --> 2945.7200000000003
my attention

2945.92 --> 2953.119
anymore the last time I like considered

2948.88 --> 2953.119
mainstream media to be real in any

2954.44 --> 2958.16
way must be

2958.88 --> 2965.7200000000003
like 15 years ago or something when I

2962.839 --> 2967.2799999999997
still had some belief that there was

2965.72 --> 2971.68
something

2967.28 --> 2975.52
useful about it but also back then it

2971.68 --> 2979.5589999999997
wasn't like Pinnacle terrible now it's

2975.52 --> 2981.64
all just terrible it's all of it it's

2979.559 --> 2983.599
just there as a pure psychological

2981.64 --> 2986.04
attack at this

2983.599 --> 2988.799
point there's nothing you can get out of

2986.04 --> 2991.4
it I mean 20 years ago you could watch

2988.799 --> 2993.0
the news and then kind of be informed

2991.4 --> 2995.64
about

2993.0 --> 2998.64
something not

2995.64 --> 2998.64
anymore

3002.76 --> 3008.5200000000004
so I'm so used to like not even consider

3005.839 --> 3010.799
it any it anymore that it just kind of I

3008.52 --> 3012.64
forget about it it's like M oh yeah

3010.799 --> 3015.7599999999998
mainstream

3012.64 --> 3018.2
media I mean my mainstream media is the

3015.76 --> 3021.5200000000004
sub mainstream media which is starting

3018.2 --> 3021.52
to suffer from the same

3021.68 --> 3028.5989999999997
issues but it's still better it's still

3025.52 --> 3030.24
somewhat informative Etc but is the fear

3028.599 --> 3035.2400000000002
por is getting in

3030.24 --> 3039.1189999999997
ETC but I mean mainstream media I can't

3035.24 --> 3039.1189999999997
believe people still watch that

3055.64 --> 3058.64
[ __ ]

3059.24 --> 3065.5589999999997
it's like you don't actually have to

3062.839 --> 3065.5589999999997
watch that you

3065.68 --> 3069.8799999999997
know there's other options

3072.88 --> 3078.1600000000003
now like 20 years

3078.24 --> 3087.2
ago let's just begin 30 years

3082.839 --> 3089.119
ago the news was on television that's

3087.2 --> 3091.7599999999998
where you had to get the

3089.119 --> 3096.7200000000003
news and the

3091.76 --> 3101.1600000000003
newspaper right like now I mean there is

3096.72 --> 3104.8799999999997
so many more options all different

3101.16 --> 3108.2
sorts like this just's no more

3104.88 --> 3110.76
point in following mainstream media it

3108.2 --> 3115.24
is such a waste of time

based or was founded on loose sand the

hide the truth in fundamental levels and

that's become part of that

3392.599 --> 3397.76
system them hiding the truth from the

general public has resulted in them

longer seeing that they were actually

3403.92 --> 3407.359
hiding the truth from the

believe that what they put there to

replace the truth with that that's real

4164.359 --> 4169.159000000001

4165.88 --> 4169.159000000001
you think that's really going to

4170.839 --> 4175.159
happen I think it will come that

4177.279 --> 4183.799000000001
far I mean that's

4180.719 --> 4188.4800000000005
legitimate that that's a relatively

4183.799 --> 4188.48
legitimate fear VI Roes I get

4193.96 --> 4199.2390000000005
it but I'm I

4196.08 --> 4203.159
mean you're in the United States

4199.239 --> 4207.199
actually getting food or even making

4203.159 --> 4210.08
food shouldn't be that

4207.199 --> 4213.639999999999
complicated right if you're going to be

4210.08 --> 4216.4
dependent on big aggra or

4213.64 --> 4219.52
industry yeah then you might get screwed

4216.4 --> 4222.879999999999
that way they're already trying to screw

4219.52 --> 4224.320000000001
you by putting crap in your food and the

4222.88 --> 4226.12
GMO and all

4224.32 --> 4228.0
that

4226.12 --> 4232.36
but I

4228.0 --> 4235.04
mean there are just like smalltime

4232.36 --> 4239.48
farmers and guys that just grow some

4235.04 --> 4239.48
food out there all over the

4239.88 --> 4246.8
place especially

4242.28 --> 4250.239
now and in in anticipation of all this

4246.8 --> 4253.400000000001
so do you really need to be afraid that

4250.239 --> 4257.0
your family members are going to

4253.4 --> 4259.879999999999
starve is that

4257.0 --> 4262.36
is that reasonable considering the

4259.88 --> 4262.36
overall

4268.44 --> 4274.159
circumstances just see it like

4270.92 --> 4277.4400000000005
this if Big Industry would all

4274.159 --> 4279.879999999999
completely totally collapse is everybody

4277.44 --> 4279.879999999999
going to

4280.08 --> 4286.04
starve or will they simply resort to

4283.0 --> 4289.92
more close at home

4286.04 --> 4292.36
natural means of providing food and

4289.92 --> 4297.4800000000005
would that work out just

4292.36 --> 4297.48
fine that's reasonable question to ask

4301.36 --> 4306.08
yourself like even I can ask that

4304.0 --> 4309.12
question and I'm in the Netherlands

4306.08 --> 4313.639
which is like almost a giant city

4309.12 --> 4318.44
state right and the bigger the

4313.639 --> 4321.96
city surface surface of City dwellings

4318.44 --> 4324.799999999999
versus outskirts where there's just like

4321.96 --> 4328.12
land to farm on and all that the bigger

4324.8 --> 4330.8
the amount of City versus land to farm

4328.12 --> 4332.4
on the the bigger that question should

4330.8 --> 4335.4800000000005
be

4332.4 --> 4338.799999999999
becomes more dangerous right if it's

4335.48 --> 4341.839999999999
just a city then yeah the risk of

4338.8 --> 4344.320000000001
starvation becomes higher but you're in

4341.84 --> 4347.92
the United States is the amount of

4344.32 --> 4354.4
Farmland that you have the

4347.92 --> 4354.4
option is like insane insanely

4358.12 --> 4364.639
large right you exactly clut you can

4362.08 --> 4368.8
actually go out and hunt and fish and

4364.639 --> 4371.8
forage yeah over here you can't really

4368.8 --> 4375.8
hunt you can fish some but it I mean

4371.8 --> 4378.0
that's going to run out quickly and for

4375.8 --> 4380.88
yeah a

4378.0 --> 4382.96
bit and that's in the Netherlands that's

4380.88 --> 4386.56
like a full city state basically

4382.96 --> 4391.96
comparatively to other countries right

4386.56 --> 4396.2390000000005
over there you have so much of

4391.96 --> 4396.2390000000005
it do you really have to be

4403.6 --> 4408.6
afraid or is that

4405.639 --> 4413.639
really just an idea based

4408.6 --> 4415.320000000001
on dependence on the system providing

4413.639 --> 4420.12
your

4415.32 --> 4420.12
food that's a legitimate question to ask

4425.48 --> 4430.48
yourself unless of course that the the

4428.12 --> 4433.8
question you asked F it's a good

4430.48 --> 4435.799999999999
question or statement if it is really

4433.8 --> 4437.360000000001
about your your person personal

4435.8 --> 4440.52
financial

4437.36 --> 4443.199
providing right if you're afraid that

4440.52 --> 4446.120000000001
you won't personally be able to like

4443.199 --> 4450.4
provide

4446.12 --> 4452.679
yeah you're an artist that can be

4450.4 --> 4457.199
tough but you got to realize that there

4452.679 --> 4457.1990000000005
will always be food options out

4463.84 --> 4469.1990000000005
there right

4465.8 --> 4469.1990000000005
as long as you can move

4470.6 --> 4476.2390000000005
around you'll be all right I mean as

4473.36 --> 4478.599999999999
soon as you like get locked in a city

4476.239 --> 4481.5599999999995
like you can't leave the city that's

4478.6 --> 4484.8
when things get really tricky

4481.56 --> 4487.6
foodwise cuz then you will be like in a

4484.8 --> 4490.84
prison camp and you will be forced

4487.6 --> 4493.8
to survive on whatever is going to be

4490.84 --> 4496.4800000000005
rolled into the City by the system

4493.8 --> 4498.400000000001
that's going to suck

4496.48 --> 4500.678999999999
but as long as you can still move around

4498.4 --> 4503.92
like there's always options to get food

4500.679 --> 4503.92
especially in the United

4507.679 --> 4513.84
States you're afraid of not having

4510.32 --> 4515.159
enough time attention to give to

4513.84 --> 4518.159000000001
subjects

4515.159 --> 4521.159
people issues that

4518.159 --> 4521.159
matter

4523.52 --> 4526.96
H that's the

4528.52 --> 4533.88
one

4530.04 --> 4536.44
well that's a dynamic

4533.88 --> 4539.639
issue that can only be solved one way

4536.44 --> 4541.879999999999
and that is figure out what is really

4539.639 --> 4544.92
unimportant and try to cut it out of

4541.88 --> 4548.08
your life try to move around

4544.92 --> 4549.84
it so that you do have enough time for

4548.08 --> 4552.5599999999995
the things that really

4549.84 --> 4557.2390000000005
matter right I suggest

4552.56 --> 4559.360000000001
that being afraid of things and then

4557.239 --> 4562.28
spending all your time on those fear

4559.36 --> 4565.839999999999
issues fighting those fear issues is

4562.28 --> 4567.5199999999995
probably one of those things that will

4565.84 --> 4570.96
make it harder for you to give the

4567.52 --> 4570.96
attention to the things that really

4571.08 --> 4574.08
matter

4574.84 --> 4580.159000000001
so but yeah that is a thing that you

4577.92 --> 4583.92
have to work

4580.159 --> 4586.839999999999
on it's a dynamic

4583.92 --> 4588.36
issue

4586.84 --> 4592.6
right but

4588.36 --> 4596.599999999999
fear it's usually fear that that does

4592.6 --> 4598.92
the most damage fear prevents you from

4596.6 --> 4602.280000000001
giving quality time to the things that

4598.92 --> 4604.88
really matter it's What Fear does the

4602.28 --> 4607.639
most take your attention away from

4604.88 --> 4607.639
things that really

4613.84 --> 4616.84
matter

4618.6 --> 4623.84
figuring out the equation versus working

4621.36 --> 4623.839999999999
on the

4627.28 --> 4633.04
equation right

4630.32 --> 4636.719
well there's some guidelines for that as

4633.04 --> 4639.239
well some pointers I could give

4636.719 --> 4641.44
you if you're having a lot of trouble

4639.239 --> 4644.159
figuring out

4641.44 --> 4645.678999999999
something and not reaching the end well

4644.159 --> 4649.799999999999
then

4645.679 --> 4651.4400000000005
dry from another angle or let it be and

4649.8 --> 4654.159000000001
let the answer come

4651.44 --> 4656.719
later right it's like if you're trying

4654.159 --> 4659.32
to puzzle something and you can't get it

4656.719 --> 4661.28
to work or you could try to force it

4659.32 --> 4665.28
spend a lot of time and energy on it and

4661.28 --> 4669.679
then like with a lot of effort maybe fix

4665.28 --> 4671.599999999999
it or you just leave it for a bit leave

4669.679 --> 4673.84
it in the back of your mind move on to

4671.6 --> 4675.679
more productive

4673.84 --> 4678.360000000001
things

4675.679 --> 4682.0
to make the energy flow

4678.36 --> 4685.639
again and then resonating with the

4682.0 --> 4687.96
energy flow might actually undo the

4685.639 --> 4691.2390000000005
clogging effect

4687.96 --> 4693.36
metaphysically of what

4691.239 --> 4696.839999999999
kept the

4693.36 --> 4700.04
Insight from being attained in the thing

4696.84 --> 4700.04
that you were trying to figure

4700.32 --> 4708.44
out sometimes you need to let something

4703.28 --> 4712.759999999999
go to to fix it or to figure it

4708.44 --> 4715.44
out it's very basic very basic tip but

4712.76 --> 4717.6
it it tends to really work so I hope

4715.44 --> 4717.599999999999
that

4719.03 --> 4723.36
[Music]

4720.44 --> 4726.239
helps

4723.36 --> 4728.88
right and it's again it's it's it

4726.239 --> 4731.159
resonates a lot with trust in God like

4728.88 --> 4733.96
don't dwell on

4731.159 --> 4736.159
fear don't dwell on something you can't

4733.96 --> 4739.0
fix you just Let It Go move on to

4736.159 --> 4741.759999999999
something that's better and

4739.0 --> 4745.36
then by resonating the things that will

4741.76 --> 4747.84
make the energies flow again you might

4745.36 --> 4749.96
just suddenly figure out that thing that

4747.84 --> 4751.639
you couldn't figure out when you were

4749.96 --> 4755.0
focusing on

4751.639 --> 4757.4800000000005
it this is part of the Dynamics of how

4755.0 --> 4757.48
the mind

4761.56 --> 4767.6
works right and it's the biggest pitfall

4764.92 --> 4770.32
of any form of obsession because any

4767.6 --> 4773.679
form of obsession will typically let you

4770.32 --> 4776.36
not go like it forces you to not let go

4773.679 --> 4779.32
is what an obsession is but then by not

4776.36 --> 4782.28
letting it go you don't fix

4779.32 --> 4783.96
it because you can't let it go and you

4782.28 --> 4786.5599999999995
get stuck and then you can't fix it

4783.96 --> 4790.52
because you can't let it go letting it

4786.56 --> 4792.719
go often will enable you to figure it

4790.52 --> 4796.8
out or fix

4792.719 --> 4799.84
it that's why obsession is bad it's

4796.8 --> 4799.84
almost always

4801.04 --> 4809.12
bad cuz Obsession tends to prevent you

4805.44 --> 4809.12
from resolving or fixing

4811.28 --> 4817.28
something right it's it's just like

4813.88 --> 4819.4800000000005
sleeping you need to sleep to regenerate

4817.28 --> 4822.239
your

4819.48 --> 4825.32
body why do you regenerate your body

4822.239 --> 4827.36
because you need to be active you need

4825.32 --> 4829.639
to have your body regenerate to be

4827.36 --> 4831.32
active well if you're like not letting

4829.639 --> 4834.719
go of the

4831.32 --> 4837.12
activity how's your body going to

4834.719 --> 4840.36
regenerate if you can't

4837.12 --> 4842.76
sleep see and that's the same pattern as

4840.36 --> 4842.759999999999
with

4846.8 --> 4851.1990000000005
Obsession so yeah letting it go very

4849.639 --> 4855.52
important

4851.199 --> 4857.44
act often to be able to resolve things

4855.52 --> 4860.320000000001
and you could symbolically see it as

4857.44 --> 4863.5599999999995
like let God take care of it it's not

4860.32 --> 4865.599999999999
always your conscious attention being in

4863.56 --> 4869.120000000001
that spot that fixes

4865.6 --> 4873.679
things sometimes you need to let it go

4869.12 --> 4876.28
and leave it to God leave it to the

4873.679 --> 4878.92
background to fix

4876.28 --> 4880.32
it and that could be the background of

4878.92 --> 4882.52
your mind your

4880.32 --> 4885.4
subconscious while your attention goes

4882.52 --> 4889.0
away to more constructive ground to

4885.4 --> 4891.879999999999
better energy flow then suddenly you get

4889.0 --> 4895.0
the right resonance the right room and

4891.88 --> 4897.12
fix it where you couldn't fix it because

4895.0 --> 4899.8
your energies were stuck while you were

4897.12 --> 4899.8
focusing on

4900.32 --> 4906.799999999999
it I hope that

4903.8 --> 4907.92
helps and thank you for the intense

4906.8 --> 4912.320000000001
questions I

4907.92 --> 4912.32
mean I told you I was going to answer

4913.12 --> 4918.96
them I got

4915.08 --> 4918.96
answers I really hope it

4925.76 --> 4931.639
helps and sorry I yelled earlier I just

4928.44 --> 4937.32
got really frustrated with just long

4931.639 --> 4937.32
silence when I have a lot of energy to

4938.44 --> 4943.759999999999
engage sometimes it just hurts me that

4941.28 --> 4946.759999999999
people don't ask me questions when I'm

4943.76 --> 4949.159000000001
like bro you I could like give you so

4946.76 --> 4951.52
much right now all you have to do is

4949.159 --> 4954.239
engage if you're just going to sit there

4951.52 --> 4956.2390000000005
and do nothing how the hell am I going

4954.239 --> 4958.599999999999
to apply myself

4956.239 --> 4960.08
here and that's why I get really

4958.6 --> 4963.88
frustrated at

4960.08 --> 4963.88
times when there's all this

4965.159 --> 4969.638999999999
silence so I thank you tiger bear

4971.48 --> 4976.44
for for asking good questions

4978.8 --> 4984.1990000000005
for putting down the Dilemma so I could

4981.32 --> 4988.28
tackle them I really hope my answers

4984.199 --> 4990.199
helped you they should help anybody that

4988.28 --> 4991.96
has those issues and a lot of people

4990.199 --> 4994.839999999999
have those issues I

4991.96 --> 4997.08
mean I have those issues at time like

4994.84 --> 5000.32
what I just explained about letting it

4997.08 --> 5003.48
go it's been like a rudimentary theme in

5000.32 --> 5005.5599999999995
my life my dad has had to tell me that

5003.48 --> 5008.0
like decades

5005.56 --> 5009.76
all the time just like Let It Go Let It

5008.0 --> 5011.12
Go you're not going to fix it until you

5009.76 --> 5013.280000000001
let it

5011.12 --> 5016.0
go I have

5013.28 --> 5018.8
to like no you have to let it go and

5016.0 --> 5022.0
like but I can't yeah well then you're

5018.8 --> 5022.0
not going to fix it

5027.36 --> 5035.36
then so yeah but knowing is half the

5033.44 --> 5039.08
battle

5035.36 --> 5041.96
right just knowing this is very helpful

5039.08 --> 5044.5599999999995
it can at least be your guide as you

5041.96 --> 5047.719
can't let it go so that at least you got

5044.56 --> 5050.360000000001
a competition with the tendency of

5047.719 --> 5052.4
obsession like yeah I have to actually

5050.36 --> 5054.32
let it go to fix it ah but I can't let

5052.4 --> 5057.159
it go but at least you got a

5054.32 --> 5060.04
counterweight so that eventually maybe

5057.159 --> 5060.879999999999
the grip of I can't let it go will start

5060.04 --> 5065.96
to

5060.88 --> 5068.32
fade so that you can let it go

5065.96 --> 5072.52
you you got to know why you need to let

5068.32 --> 5072.5199999999995
it go to Let It Go

5075.28 --> 5078.759999999999
sometimes got to be

5080.639 --> 5084.52
reminded all right

5085.96 --> 5089.1
[Music]

5093.32 --> 5099.36
anyway

5096.199 --> 5102.5599999999995
it is always kind of interesting to me

5099.36 --> 5105.28
that people that live in America that

5102.56 --> 5109.96
includes Canada that they all seem to

5105.28 --> 5114.44
have this almost obsessive

5109.96 --> 5117.4
fear with not being able to provide

5114.44 --> 5121.0
food this seems to be a very cultural

5117.4 --> 5124.36
thing for you guys and not like saying

5121.0 --> 5125.8
you're less for it it's just it's it's a

5124.36 --> 5128.4
it's a bit

5125.8 --> 5134.08
curious that that's the case when in

5128.4 --> 5134.08
America it's like running out of food

5136.639 --> 5142.88
really like I personally here being in

5140.76 --> 5146.119000000001
the Netherlands should be much more

5142.88 --> 5149.159000000001
worried about running out of food

5146.119 --> 5152.199
everybody than you guys in

5149.159 --> 5154.92
America I'm not worried about it though

5152.199 --> 5156.119
but Americans and Canadians I guess as

5154.92 --> 5158.719
an

5156.119 --> 5161.0
extension they tend to typically have

5158.719 --> 5164.4
this cultural worry about running out of

5161.0 --> 5166.719
food when the likelihood of that

5164.4 --> 5169.48
actually really happening to the point

5166.719 --> 5172.96
where people are going to die

5169.48 --> 5175.599999999999
is so abysmal the chances of that

5172.96 --> 5178.4800000000005
happening is so

5175.6 --> 5182.04
abysmal like everything else could go

5178.48 --> 5182.04
wrong but that pretty

5183.08 --> 5188.119
much and

5184.92 --> 5191.08
and like when's the last time Americans

5188.119 --> 5191.08
have actually

5193.92 --> 5201.04
starved I don't think anybody alive in

5197.08 --> 5203.5199999999995
America right now has actually really

5201.04 --> 5203.5199999999995
known

5208.119 --> 5212.88
starvation like even during the what is

5213.239 --> 5217.759999999999
it

5215.199 --> 5220.599999999999
during all these banking Crisis crisis

5217.76 --> 5222.679
and all that in the early 20th century I

5220.6 --> 5226.2390000000005
mean even back then I mean yeah it would

5222.679 --> 5229.159
have been problematic but truly starving

5226.239 --> 5229.159
to death I

5229.719 --> 5234.119
mean that was probably pretty

5234.28 --> 5239.48
rare I think that actually for example

5237.639 --> 5244.6
in in

5239.48 --> 5246.839999999999
Russia it's been a much bigger problem

5244.6 --> 5249.679
historically also because there's just

5246.84 --> 5253.1990000000005
so many super remote locations and then

5249.679 --> 5255.1990000000005
if harvests fail then literally like a

5253.199 --> 5257.0
village might just starve to death

5255.199 --> 5259.759999999999
because suddenly they don't have any

5257.0 --> 5263.32
food at all right so I think that

5259.76 --> 5266.56
traditionally in Russia starvation is a

5263.32 --> 5268.4
much bigger issue always has been

5266.56 --> 5269.639
compared to the United States where it

5268.4 --> 5271.879999999999
has

5269.639 --> 5276.119
been barely an

5271.88 --> 5276.119
issue overall

5281.199 --> 5284.32
but

5282.56 --> 5287.88
yet

5284.32 --> 5290.88
somehow Americans do seem to worry a lot

5287.88 --> 5290.88
about star

5291.32 --> 5295.36
starvation and it's kind of weird I mean

5293.48 --> 5297.44
I'm not going to say oh that's stupid or

5295.36 --> 5301.28
whatever it's just it's kind of

5297.44 --> 5306.119
weird really when you think of it

5301.28 --> 5306.119
historically am I right

5313.04 --> 5317.8
right I'm not saying that nobody ever

5314.96 --> 5320.199
starved to death in America that's not

5317.8 --> 5324.76
what I'm saying I'm just saying like on

5320.199 --> 5328.919999999999
average even in like the worst of times

5324.76 --> 5331.76
it it was probably the most prevalent

5328.92 --> 5335.4800000000005
during war times because hey this is

5331.76 --> 5337.4800000000005
Rule of fist during war time times a lot

5335.48 --> 5339.599999999999
of people actually do die from

5337.48 --> 5342.759999999999
starvation and that's even a logic

5339.6 --> 5348.400000000001
behind that and that's the logic of

5342.76 --> 5351.08
Siege right Siege you surround the enemy

5348.4 --> 5352.04
you cut off their resources they start

5351.08 --> 5356.44
to

5352.04 --> 5361.5199999999995
starve that's why in war actual War hot

5356.44 --> 5361.5199999999995
war with Siege starvation does

5363.04 --> 5366.04
happen

5368.28 --> 5376.48
but in nonh Hot War

5372.639 --> 5379.84
situations it it's very

5376.48 --> 5383.799999999999
rare unless it's circumstantial because

5379.84 --> 5386.2390000000005
food provision is tough for the region

5383.8 --> 5389.119000000001
because it's like very remote and very

5386.239 --> 5391.718999999999
cold and then the risk of starvation on

5389.119 --> 5391.719
average is

5393.04 --> 5396.04
higher

5398.28 --> 5404.5599999999995
so I bet for example that around the

5400.56 --> 5407.719
times of Civil War in the United States

5404.56 --> 5411.8
there probably did starve quite a few

5407.719 --> 5411.8
people to death because of

5415.44 --> 5420.04
seeg right but I

5417.76 --> 5422.56
mean outside of

5420.04 --> 5425.56
that I don't think it really ever

5422.56 --> 5428.4400000000005
happened because Siege only happens when

5425.56 --> 5431.6
there's war on your

5428.44 --> 5435.96
soil and the Civil War is pretty much

5431.6 --> 5441.280000000001
the last time that happened isn't it

5435.96 --> 5441.28
technically and that's hundreds of years

5444.159 --> 5451.4
ago yet the fear of starvation or not

5448.6 --> 5455.84
being able to provide for your family

5451.4 --> 5458.719
still seems like this strong impulse

5455.84 --> 5458.719
it's it's kind of

5461.159 --> 5465.4
odd so yeah don't be

5475.199 --> 5481.199
afraid right and also realize even if if

5478.84 --> 5484.4400000000005
you're like in a poverty

5481.199 --> 5486.678999999999
situation and that might happen it might

5484.44 --> 5489.48
happen that there's just less means

5486.679 --> 5492.36
available to get food or you just have

5489.48 --> 5497.4
less income for some reason bad luck bad

5492.36 --> 5501.0
timing it happens remember that morality

5497.4 --> 5501.0
is a very big

5501.04 --> 5507.92
part of whether you will effectively

5504.28 --> 5510.96
starve or not cuz if you're all like

5507.92 --> 5515.52
feeling terrible and you're in fear then

5510.96 --> 5518.6
not having food is very punishing

5515.52 --> 5520.6
like it will actually drain your bodies

5518.6 --> 5523.84
and that of your children and your wife

5520.6 --> 5526.1990000000005
and all that it will demoralization is

5523.84 --> 5529.88
actually way

5526.199 --> 5532.759999999999
worse than just not eating as

5529.88 --> 5535.96
much if you're demoralized when you

5532.76 --> 5538.0
don't have food it's way worse for you

5535.96 --> 5540.4
than when you're just like okay we'll

5538.0 --> 5543.48
just eat a little less I'll just like do

5540.4 --> 5545.159
fasting a little bit and I'll be happy

5543.48 --> 5548.44
about it

5545.159 --> 5550.719
I'll trust in God well the person that's

5548.44 --> 5554.879999999999
trusting in God and eating less is going

5550.719 --> 5558.32
to be off way better than the person

5554.88 --> 5559.88
that is in fear and thinks the world's

5558.32 --> 5561.799999999999
going to hell and they're all going to

5559.88 --> 5563.8
starve to death because they have a

5561.8 --> 5566.04
little less food than usual because of

5563.8 --> 5570.0
some

5566.04 --> 5572.4
downturn it really matters a lot

5570.0 --> 5575.52
practically keep that in

5572.4 --> 5578.44
mind yeah

5575.52 --> 5581.4800000000005
moralization is basically more important

5578.44 --> 5584.159
than the amount of food you have

5581.48 --> 5585.879999999999
available keep that in mind it's really

5584.159 --> 5588.48
it really

5585.88 --> 5592.76
matters right because being demoralized

5588.48 --> 5594.239
is is a big drain on your body so if you

5592.76 --> 5596.719
Fe if you're

5594.239 --> 5601.28
fearing that you're going to starve that

5596.719 --> 5601.28
will actually contribute to your

5601.8 --> 5609.119000000001
starvation when you have less food

5604.6 --> 5612.6
available really I I can emphasize this

5609.119 --> 5614.5199999999995
enough to all of you it's really

5612.6 --> 5616.92
important anyway I'm going to take a

5614.52 --> 5620.400000000001
bite on my Illuminati Kasa before it

5616.92 --> 5620.4
gets cold so

5632.719 --> 5635.719
cheers

5637.8 --> 5641.02
[Music]

5656.52 --> 5660.159000000001
I hope you're all doing okay out

5662.719 --> 5665.719
there

5686.81 --> 5690.249000000001
[Music]

5692.639 --> 5695.639
for

5697.52 --> 5703.1990000000005
and just again remember overall that

5701.199 --> 5704.919999999999
prolonged

5703.199 --> 5708.119
fear

5704.92 --> 5711.52
clouds your mind and actually prevents

5708.119 --> 5714.08
you from finding a solution to the thing

5711.52 --> 5719.400000000001
you're you're

5714.08 --> 5722.48
fearing right fear

5719.4 --> 5724.159
practically I I mean nobody should be

5722.48 --> 5726.199
totally Fearless because

5724.159 --> 5727.5599999999995
you yeah fear exists for a reason it's a

5726.199 --> 5731.119
warning

5727.56 --> 5732.88
mechanism but right let's just compare

5731.119 --> 5736.639
fear to an

5732.88 --> 5739.719
alarm oh there's something happening

5736.639 --> 5741.4400000000005
alarm do you want that alarm to keep

5739.719 --> 5744.92
going

5741.44 --> 5749.119
nonstop all the time or is that going to

5744.92 --> 5751.1990000000005
be a major distraction and a headache no

5749.119 --> 5754.199
but you do want it to go off but then

5751.199 --> 5757.879999999999
you want it to shut off also right just

5754.199 --> 5759.48
get the alarm a bit of fear like oh [ __ ]

5757.88 --> 5762.400000000001
and then let it

5759.48 --> 5766.718999999999
go and that's the best way to deal with

5762.4 --> 5769.879999999999
it don't don't deny the

5766.719 --> 5772.32
fear just take it as a warning signal

5769.88 --> 5775.400000000001
and then try to let it go cuz if you're

5772.32 --> 5779.119
going to have the Fear playing out

5775.4 --> 5782.5599999999995
continually it's going to

5779.119 --> 5784.88
disrupt your ability to find a

5782.56 --> 5788.84
solution

5784.88 --> 5791.92
to what to the

5788.84 --> 5794.639
fear so you got to let it

5791.92 --> 5797.679
go and that

5794.639 --> 5801.96
way you're

5797.679 --> 5804.56
using a part of the tools set that God

5801.96 --> 5807.159
provided you with

5804.56 --> 5809.88
correctly or if you just let the alarm

5807.159 --> 5812.5199999999995
Bell go rampant and never stop yeah it's

5809.88 --> 5815.52
going to be super

5812.52 --> 5815.52
disruptive

5818.159 --> 5821.48
keep that in mind remember

5822.91 --> 5830.099999999999
[Music]

5831.48 --> 5837.32
that having a moment of fear is not bad

5835.159 --> 5840.599999999999
it's holding on to the fear that's

5837.32 --> 5840.599999999999
really that does the

5842.52 --> 5845.52
damage

5847.84 --> 5851.92
when you find yourself getting sick at

5849.76 --> 5851.92
the

5858.04 --> 5864.5199999999995
moment hey thank feel good to you yeah

5861.4 --> 5864.5199999999995
that's tough tiger

5864.96 --> 5872.32
bear your body wants to jump and

5868.28 --> 5872.32
leap take care of all these

5872.44 --> 5877.598999999999
tasks

5874.0 --> 5877.599
that's very that's very common

5883.119 --> 5887.119
actually and that's that's a tough

5885.28 --> 5888.88
Dilemma to deal with by the way tarer

5887.119 --> 5891.96
bear if you're getting sick but you

5888.88 --> 5894.96
still want to like continue it's like

5891.96 --> 5898.719
your your body is

5894.96 --> 5901.52
already like you got to realize first

5898.719 --> 5905.52
off that when you get sick that's

5901.52 --> 5908.4400000000005
actually your body resolving the issue

5905.52 --> 5911.280000000001
it's not a problem developing it's a

5908.44 --> 5914.879999999999
problem getting resolved it's basically

5911.28 --> 5920.28
getting sick is often the Regeneration

5914.88 --> 5921.88
process cleaning up but yeah you can't

5920.28 --> 5925.5199999999995
really function while that happens

5921.88 --> 5927.0
properly but your mind wants to still

5925.52 --> 5929.76
keep

5927.0 --> 5931.199
going so you might get that issue where

5929.76 --> 5933.4400000000005
it starts to become

5931.199 --> 5934.44
conflicting I don't really know all too

5933.44 --> 5938.239
to

5934.44 --> 5941.159
well how to resolve

5938.239 --> 5944.44
that except just like try to let it go

5941.159 --> 5944.44
try to give yourself some

5945.719 --> 5952.04
room but it's tough it can be very tough

5948.32 --> 5955.08
to lay down these responsibilities that

5952.04 --> 5959.44
you perceive in order to give your body

5955.08 --> 5959.44
the room to just sick it

5962.36 --> 5968.199
out

5964.719 --> 5970.92
right but if you can find some kind of

5968.199 --> 5973.36
Middle Road with that that's just

5970.92 --> 5976.04
fine you don't have to like super

5973.36 --> 5978.719
strictly like no I'm going to drop

5976.04 --> 5981.239
absolutely everything until I'm better

5978.719 --> 5984.76
that might not be

5981.239 --> 5986.678999999999
ideal because sudden mindset change can

5984.76 --> 5988.84
also have a demoralizing effect which

5986.679 --> 5992.36
isn't

5988.84 --> 5995.360000000001
good as long as you don't also do the

5992.36 --> 5998.239
opposite and just like I am going to

5995.36 --> 6000.839999999999
ignore my sickness I'm just going to

5998.239 --> 6003.4
work right through it that's not very

6000.84 --> 6005.52
healthy either I mean you should only do

6003.4 --> 6008.0
that when it's really critical when you

6005.52 --> 6010.4400000000005
like notice like if I stop now

6008.0 --> 6012.4
everything's going to fall apart then

6010.44 --> 6016.0
you might have to do

6012.4 --> 6018.0
that right but it's it's not healthy

6016.0 --> 6020.48
it's not healthy to do that eventually

6018.0 --> 6023.08
your body will suffer under it because

6020.48 --> 6029.08
your regeneration processes will simply

6023.08 --> 6029.08
be become obstructed it w won't be

6034.76 --> 6038.52
completed it's tough to find a Middle

6036.84 --> 6040.08
Road in

6038.52 --> 6042.92
that

6040.08 --> 6045.4
just you can still keep doing some

6042.92 --> 6047.4400000000005
things as long as you realize your body

6045.4 --> 6051.5599999999995
needs a little extra

6047.44 --> 6051.5599999999995
room to fix itself to

6052.239 --> 6055.239
regenerate

6063.8 --> 6068.08
so yeah I hope that works out for you

6065.8 --> 6071.159000000001
tiger

6068.08 --> 6073.719
bear right and also remember low on

6071.159 --> 6076.879999999999
sugar try to keep the sugar

6073.719 --> 6078.88
low that's about this overall period

6076.88 --> 6081.88
sugar is not going to help

6078.88 --> 6081.88
you

6082.239 --> 6088.718999999999
regenerate it's mostly going to Spur

6084.84 --> 6088.719
your mind to want to take on more

6093.44 --> 6097.919999999999
tasks and it's going to feed the

6099.0 --> 6103.48
bacteria which are all blooming now in

6101.28 --> 6103.48
this

6103.56 --> 6106.56
period

6112.239 --> 6115.239
right

6142.159 --> 6144.91

6246.28 --> 6249.88
been enjoying the

6250.8 --> 6257.56
show maybe it's been very confronting I

6253.96 --> 6257.56
guess today is a bit

6258.04 --> 6264.119

[Music]

6771.44 --> 6774.44
wow

6786.4 --> 6793.079
yeah by the way isg is like the eclipse

6789.4 --> 6796.28
going to come over your place as

6793.079 --> 6799.04
well cuz it is making that stripe all

6796.28 --> 6801.44
the way to the Northeast is it going to

6799.04 --> 6804.04
like hit hit your

6801.44 --> 6806.839999999999
place

6804.04 --> 6806.84
or close to

6810.239 --> 6813.959999999999
it yes

6814.119 --> 6818.96
cool you should definitely like try to

6816.48 --> 6818.959999999999
film

6820.239 --> 6825.36
that if the weather's going to doable

6822.88 --> 6826.719
for it might be like snow storming or

6825.36 --> 6830.079
whatever that's going to be tough to

6826.719 --> 6832.8
film then although really pretty awesome

6830.079 --> 6834.759999999999
to see an eclipse like dir during a

6832.8 --> 6838.04
snowstorm would it like just suddenly

6834.76 --> 6839.96
become really dark in the

6838.04 --> 6844.119
snowstorm oh you're in the path of

6839.96 --> 6844.119
totality even wow that's that's

6855.96 --> 6858.96
interesting

6861.36 --> 6864.36
oh

6867.2 --> 6870.3
[Music]

6872.84 --> 6875.1990000000005

6876.64 --> 6885.85
[Music]

6888.08 --> 6894.32
[Music]

6891.32 --> 6894.32
excited

6899.97 --> 6905.0
[Music]

6903.119 --> 6908.759999999999
by the way I've been hearing some weird

6905.0 --> 6912.04
rumors concerning the eclipse that vely

6908.76 --> 6916.360000000001
remember being addressed before previous

6912.04 --> 6920.119
Eclipse situations that the eclipse may

6916.36 --> 6924.839999999999
have some kind of strange influence on

6920.119 --> 6929.119
food that you shouldn't leave food

6924.84 --> 6929.119000000001
exposed to the light of the

6931.119 --> 6936.159
eclipse I have no idea to like

6936.92 --> 6942.56
really like I have no grip on that but

6939.679 --> 6945.76
it is like

6942.56 --> 6948.4400000000005
just it's an

6945.76 --> 6950.4800000000005
idea makes me wonder like okay so if

6948.44 --> 6952.678999999999
you're going to eat around that

6950.48 --> 6955.678999999999
day you might want to have have your

6952.679 --> 6955.679
food

6956.56 --> 6964.639
stored like not potentially freshly

6959.8 --> 6964.639
picked so that you like don't pick the

6964.84 --> 6969.719
herbs that have just that day been

6967.44 --> 6972.5599999999995
exposed to the eclipse light and rather

6969.719 --> 6975.92
like have some stuff stored or

6972.56 --> 6978.2390000000005
precooked separately stored inside the

6975.92 --> 6981.0
house that you're then going to eat that

6978.239 --> 6983.799999999999
day and maybe the same goes for milk I'm

6981.0 --> 6988.079
not sure it's weird

6983.8 --> 6990.28
this might all just be Superstition

6988.079 --> 6992.719
though and I'm not really going to have

6990.28 --> 6995.639
that problem

6992.719 --> 6998.4800000000005
because like yeah when you eat from

6995.639 --> 7002.41
supermarket food your food is mostly

6998.48 --> 7007.009999999999
going to be stored inside of a

7002.41 --> 7007.01
[Music]

7009.74 --> 7013.5599999999995
[Music]

7011.239 --> 7015.199
refrigerator but yeah I don't know I

7013.56 --> 7018.52
don't even know if there is something to

7015.199 --> 7020.879999999999
it maybe if you do that you're like oh

7018.52 --> 7023.159000000001
I'm going to have an

7020.88 --> 7025.88
eclipse

7023.159 --> 7028.759999999999
herb vegetable stew and I'm all going to

7025.88 --> 7032.28
pick that stuff during the eclipse and

7028.76 --> 7034.159000000001
then cook it and then like eat it maybe

7032.28 --> 7037.5599999999995
something weird will

7034.159 --> 7041.159
happen as in like the bacteria are

7037.56 --> 7042.570000000001
acting weird or whatever I have no

7041.159 --> 7046.688999999999
idea

7042.57 --> 7046.688999999999
[Music]

7048.639 --> 7054.0
you are going to leave a few burgers in

7051.239 --> 7054.0
the garden on

7055.0 --> 7059.28
that H thank you for that Gary

7060.52 --> 7069.4800000000005
F right but it's like yeah

7065.639 --> 7071.119
maybe like getting fresh milk during the

7069.48 --> 7073.44
eclipse like getting it out of the

7071.119 --> 7076.079
others during the eclipse might not be

7073.44 --> 7079.44
the best moment to get your milk and

7076.079 --> 7082.159
like slaughtering it around the eclipse

7079.44 --> 7084.119
might not be the best time to do it

7082.159 --> 7089.598999999999
that's kind of the idea I'm getting from

7084.119 --> 7092.5199999999995
it but I have absolutely no idea whether

7089.599 --> 7095.679
this entire thing is pure

7092.52 --> 7098.079000000001
Superstition that would then like hook

7095.679 --> 7100.159
into the fear porn situation about the

7098.079 --> 7104.119
eclipse or whether there's actually

7100.159 --> 7104.119
something to it I have no idea

7105.04 --> 7112.36
I mean it's not overall strange to thing

7110.079 --> 7113.36
to think that celestial bodies may have

7112.36 --> 7116.079
an

7113.36 --> 7120.598999999999
influence on

7116.079 --> 7124.759999999999
life Moonlight has an influence on

7120.599 --> 7127.4800000000005
life like on bacteria and fungi that's

7124.76 --> 7131.52
like provable it's it's provable that it

7127.48 --> 7132.839999999999
does that so maybe the eclipse does also

7131.52 --> 7134.56
have

7132.84 --> 7137.4400000000005
a special type of

7134.56 --> 7141.1990000000005
effect I don't know I don't know for

7137.44 --> 7145.36
sure but I'm not going to like just say

7141.199 --> 7149.799999999999
absolutely not no I it could be and it

7145.36 --> 7149.799999999999
might be really exaggerated how

7150.63 --> 7156.679
[Music]

7152.92 --> 7159.56
much but as a general

7156.679 --> 7164.04
precaution you might just want to do the

7159.56 --> 7164.04
cooking for the day of the eclipse

7164.96 --> 7171.4
like ahead of

7167.52 --> 7174.56
time like cook some meals the day before

7171.4 --> 7177.28
that you then warm up during the

7174.56 --> 7179.719
eclipse so that you don't just get

7177.28 --> 7183.0
everything fresh from the eclipse day

7179.719 --> 7184.92
itself I I know it makes me sound a feel

7183.0 --> 7188.36
like I'm sounding a bit silly with this

7184.92 --> 7190.28
but I just felt that maybe I need to

7188.36 --> 7192.799999999999
mention this and it's a bit of a

7190.28 --> 7194.759999999999
curiosity like I do Wonder like is there

7192.8 --> 7197.0
really something to this or is it just

7194.76 --> 7197.0
the

7202.84 --> 7208.88
Superstition that's hilarious Gary I be

7205.239 --> 7208.879999999999
leaving a few burgers in the

7220.96 --> 7223.96
garden

7226.719 --> 7233.119
right right but beside that little thing

7230.0 --> 7234.4
most importantly Don't Be Afraid like

7233.119 --> 7236.96
when it's going to happen when the

7234.4 --> 7241.32
eclipse is

7236.96 --> 7244.84
there feel God feel love of God Don't Be

7241.32 --> 7248.119
Afraid don't let go of all the

7244.84 --> 7250.2390000000005
fear that go of the preconception that

7248.119 --> 7253.119
something terrible might happen or that

7250.239 --> 7256.239
there's a bad influence or that a gate

7253.119 --> 7259.4
to hell might be opened with ser and the

7256.239 --> 7263.199
three rockets being fired by NASA

7259.4 --> 7267.04
towards the sun and the devil Comet

7263.199 --> 7269.5199999999995
coming along oh no yeah just let it all

7267.04 --> 7271.32
go let it all

7269.52 --> 7275.079000000001
go and

7271.32 --> 7277.5599999999995
just feel the love of

7275.079 --> 7281.5199999999995
God during that

7277.56 --> 7284.8
day that's my recommendation and I

7281.52 --> 7289.1990000000005
guarantee gue you that you'll

7284.8 --> 7293.159000000001
be better off way better off with a

7289.199 --> 7296.4
surplus if you do that compared to doing

7293.159 --> 7298.638999999999
pretty much anything else doing it any

7296.4 --> 7301.079
other way considering any of the fair

7298.639 --> 7301.079
porn

7302.159 --> 7309.44
things yeah don't be afraid and I'm

7306.119 --> 7310.839999999999
going to keep re reemphasizing this in

7309.44 --> 7314.36
in the coming

7310.84 --> 7317.32
week I'm going to tell all of you like

7314.36 --> 7320.44
every day don't be afraid it's very

7317.32 --> 7322.799999999999
important it's always important but now

7320.44 --> 7326.119
it's even more

7322.8 --> 7329.88
important you don't have to be

7326.119 --> 7332.639
afraid trust God do it

7329.88 --> 7334.92
now and you don't have to be perfect you

7332.639 --> 7338.079
don't have to like oh but I have fear

7334.92 --> 7340.84
issues that's okay everybody has fear

7338.079 --> 7344.88
issues in periods of their

7340.84 --> 7347.28
life but try to make sure to to let it

7344.88 --> 7347.28
go

7348.239 --> 7357.0
now try to actively let it

7351.679 --> 7361.36
go cuz you'll have a lot of

7357.0 --> 7364.719
value out of out of it if you do that

7361.36 --> 7368.28
now in this coming period around the

7364.719 --> 7370.8
eclipse I guarantee it you're going to

7368.28 --> 7373.759999999999
be a lot better for it you're going to

7370.8 --> 7379.2390000000005
have probably more control over your

7373.76 --> 7379.2390000000005
fears if you do that from that point

7397.36 --> 7404.04
on oh oh is already done the lawnmower

7401.52 --> 7404.040000000001
is done

7417.88 --> 7423.28
already can you believe how many

7420.159 --> 7427.44
nonsense things they're rolling

7423.28 --> 7431.48
out oh the eclipse is happening the

7427.44 --> 7435.0
hedron collider is going to fire up and

7431.48 --> 7435.759999999999
n is going to launch three rockets at

7435.0 --> 7438.44
the

7435.76 --> 7443.400000000001
eclipse and the devil comet is going to

7438.44 --> 7443.4
be visible and like

7444.599 --> 7451.360000000001
bro I mean did I miss anything was there

7448.4 --> 7454.48
anything else you could add to

7451.36 --> 7454.48
that I

7454.559 --> 7462.28
mean these things I mentioned that's all

7458.639 --> 7464.52
official isn't that just a blatant sign

7462.28 --> 7467.84
of

7464.52 --> 7473.2390000000005
desperation all of

7467.84 --> 7473.2390000000005
that I mean doesn't it feel

7473.599 --> 7480.32
desperate it's like they're

7477.079 --> 7484.88
desperate for you to be

7480.32 --> 7487.759999999999
afraid why else would you like put

7484.88 --> 7489.52
everything all together in that basket

7487.76 --> 7492.4800000000005
like

7489.52 --> 7496.320000000001
that it's bizarre

7492.48 --> 7498.36
oh the red halfer yeah yeah seeking yeah

7496.32 --> 7503.679
yeah everything I had to pull the

7498.36 --> 7508.04
Antichrist in it and yeah

7503.679 --> 7512.28
nuts but I mean the desperation man is

7508.04 --> 7512.28
just oozing out of

7513.719 --> 7519.44
it it's not working on me like it's not

7517.199 --> 7522.0
working it just I'm just seeing the

7519.44 --> 7526.879999999999
desperation from the darkness it's like

7522.0 --> 7530.88
wow like it's clawing like a

7526.88 --> 7534.0
clawing one last time as it's going to

7530.88 --> 7536.559
like lose its last piece of grip and and

7534.0 --> 7537.92
fall into the abyss or something it's

7536.559 --> 7542.88
such a

7537.92 --> 7542.88
desperate set of things they put

7544.04 --> 7550.04
together and all I can feel is like wow

7547.119 --> 7554.32
God's here God

7550.04 --> 7556.96
is God is radiating energy and I feel so

7554.32 --> 7559.199
much love and peace

7556.96 --> 7561.559
and and

7559.199 --> 7564.239
resolution and like the fear is just not

7561.559 --> 7567.079000000001
touching me I'm just seeing it as

7564.239 --> 7572.678999999999
desperation from their

7567.079 --> 7572.679
side the Locust stuff oh yeah of

7576.599 --> 7583.04
course yeah anything they

7579.84 --> 7585.28
can and who knows maybe they will do

7583.04 --> 7589.119
something nasty maybe they'll like torch

7585.28 --> 7592.92
a bunch of places again or

7589.119 --> 7595.719
something I mean it the likelihood of of

7592.92 --> 7595.719
the the

7595.76 --> 7602.400000000001
elite right of the Beast system the not

7599.88 --> 7605.079
nilk

7602.4 --> 7609.119
Aran they're going to they're desperate

7605.079 --> 7611.88
to to reinforce the fear and the grip on

7609.119 --> 7615.28
the people's minds and so they might

7611.88 --> 7617.559
like pull more stuff like there's an

7615.28 --> 7620.079
idea that there might be something weird

7617.559 --> 7622.599
with the Baltimore bridge collapse I

7620.079 --> 7624.5199999999995
mean I wasn't the only one other people

7622.599 --> 7627.400000000001
have taken notice of it oh how dare you

7624.52 --> 7629.4400000000005
Arn you're not you're not an engineer

7627.4 --> 7632.119
you're not a bridge designer how dare

7629.44 --> 7633.839999999999
you say there's something off about it

7632.119 --> 7636.4
yeah I'm not the only one and it's not

7633.84 --> 7641.32
just gatria

7636.4 --> 7643.4
yeah so that might be an early start of

7641.32 --> 7645.04
that and there might be more [ __ ] that

7643.4 --> 7649.48
they

7645.04 --> 7653.079
pull just to to pile it

7649.48 --> 7655.959999999999
on but again don't be

7653.079 --> 7660.4
afraid really

7655.96 --> 7663.719
don't see it as the darkness desperately

7660.4 --> 7666.04
trying to claw you back they want you

7663.719 --> 7669.96
back they want you back into the loop

7666.04 --> 7671.84
want you back into their fear control

7669.96 --> 7673.88
and they're throwing everything that got

7671.84 --> 7677.76
at you just because they just really

7673.88 --> 7681.079
want you back cuz their grip is

7677.76 --> 7686.4400000000005
slipping see it like that keep seeing it

7681.079 --> 7686.44
like that even as dark events May

7686.48 --> 7690.598999999999
unfold more things blow

7691.0 --> 7697.76
up something I'm sure there's going to

7694.239 --> 7700.558999999999
be terrible things that will be suddenly

7697.76 --> 7703.4400000000005
revealed and all that but keep it in

7700.559 --> 7703.4400000000005
mind don't be Afra

7704.239 --> 7709.5199999999995
afid it's just the devil desperately

7710.599 --> 7718.360000000001
clawing to try to get some grip back as

7713.92 --> 7720.0
it is losing its grip and destined to

7718.36 --> 7724.159
fall into the

7720.0 --> 7724.159
abyss that's what that is right

7730.44 --> 7733.44
now

7747.159 --> 7751.32
hello by the way good to see you seeking

7749.0 --> 7751.32
star

7751.679 --> 7758.4800000000005
water yeah their whole red eff thing

7755.96 --> 7760.36
so who knows man maybe they will have

7758.48 --> 7762.04
like the the weird

7760.36 --> 7764.5199999999995
Antichrist

7762.04 --> 7766.679
little freaky [ __ ] guy come out all of

7764.52 --> 7766.679
a

7779.36 --> 7787.32
sudden but I mean it's just going to be

7782.96 --> 7791.079
weird nobody's going to take that guy

7787.32 --> 7794.079
serious until he starts to wield powers

7791.079 --> 7798.04
and all that but I mean even then it's

7794.079 --> 7798.04
still going to be like what the hell is

7798.199 --> 7808.119
this okay we got the weird [ __ ]

7802.679 --> 7812.4400000000005
guy people call him the Antichrist okay

7808.119 --> 7814.92
whatever it's just going to be like a

7812.44 --> 7817.719
the head of the Beast system really

7814.92 --> 7821.32
that's people are never probably going

7817.719 --> 7823.559
to really see him as like like a spirit

7821.32 --> 7826.04
spiritual figure or something or even an

7823.559 --> 7828.92
anti-spiritual

7826.04 --> 7830.88
figure what I suspect except for people

7828.92 --> 7834.4800000000005
within the Beast system that might have

7830.88 --> 7834.4800000000005
a tendency to like worship

7842.079 --> 7846.558999999999
him but let's just say whatever they're

7844.84 --> 7849.400000000001
going to do whatever they're going to

7846.559 --> 7851.76
reveal however big they plan it it's not

7849.4 --> 7855.759999999999
going to work the way they want it to

7851.76 --> 7858.0
work because the overall grip of the

7855.76 --> 7860.76
darkness is

7858.0 --> 7864.199
slipping so yeah they might have planned

7860.76 --> 7865.92
all this stuff ahead of time even it's

7864.199 --> 7868.119
not going to work the way they thought

7865.92 --> 7868.119
it

7869.599 --> 7874.400000000001
would doesn't matter how long they

7871.92 --> 7874.4
prepared

7876.52 --> 7881.84
it the apocalypse overrides

7880.239 --> 7883.28
it

7881.84 --> 7886.679
and so the

7883.28 --> 7889.96
Armageddon is just going to be their

7886.679 --> 7889.96
Armageddon not

7892.199 --> 7895.199
ours

7909.04 --> 7915.079
right and I mean I still feel it like oh

7912.4 --> 7918.799999999999
the Antichrist might come oh yeah well

7915.079 --> 7922.04
isn't that followed up by the return of

7918.8 --> 7925.4800000000005
Christ I think Christ's already

7922.04 --> 7928.28
returned through

7925.48 --> 7930.48
us I don't think Christ returns as an

7928.28 --> 7933.5199999999995
individual man I think that he returns

7930.48 --> 7935.598999999999
in all of us in those who are open to

7933.52 --> 7940.159000000001
him

7935.599 --> 7942.04
like as he said You shall

7940.159 --> 7945.28
do

7942.04 --> 7945.28
like I did and

7945.719 --> 7953.28
more he's going to return through us for

7949.159 --> 7956.759999999999
those that are actually open to the

7953.28 --> 7961.0
original Jesus's wisdom to those who

7956.76 --> 7964.599
will be like avatars for

7961.0 --> 7968.84
Jesus and not like oh I am the special

7964.599 --> 7971.679
boy I'm the only one no those are fake

7968.84 --> 7974.4800000000005
no it's the Christ spirit

7971.679 --> 7976.639
the Holy Spirit and it's going to be

7974.48 --> 7980.0
really strong really powerful and it's

7976.639 --> 7980.0
not about the ego at

7980.559 --> 7984.92
all those will who will have the Christ

7983.36 --> 7989.0
spirit will

7984.92 --> 7991.719
not ask for recognition about it or even

7989.0 --> 7994.36
claim they are unique in any way it

7991.719 --> 7996.0
isn't unique it's just the return of

7994.36 --> 7997.92
Christ's

7996.0 --> 8002.48
spirit in

7997.92 --> 8005.159
us to counter the darkness

8002.48 --> 8005.159
and seal

8006.0 --> 8009.599
it seal it

8011.119 --> 8017.799999999999
away that's what I believe will

8014.4 --> 8019.239
happen and I think that Christ has

8017.8 --> 8022.84
already

8019.239 --> 8025.199
returned through us through the people

8022.84 --> 8028.159000000001
through the

8025.199 --> 8031.678999999999
apocalypse bits and pieces come

8028.159 --> 8034.558999999999
back insights are regained

8031.679 --> 8038.4400000000005
realizations about

8034.559 --> 8041.320000000001
lies are bringing us closer to the truth

8038.44 --> 8044.159
and to what Jesus Christ really is and

8041.32 --> 8044.159
what's really

8049.559 --> 8054.559
happening the great stream yeah thank

8052.159 --> 8057.4
you Bill night I

8054.559 --> 8060.04
am I'm feeling a lot a lot of good

8057.4 --> 8064.839999999999
energies too

8060.04 --> 8064.84
and I really hope I hope I'm

8065.559 --> 8070.96
helping I'm doing my best I'm glad that

8069.239 --> 8072.5199999999995
at least today I'm like able to

8070.96 --> 8074.76
concentrate a lot better I mean I had

8072.52 --> 8077.400000000001
some real serious concentration problems

8074.76 --> 8077.400000000001
in the last

8077.639 --> 8081.76
week which might have something to do

8080.239 --> 8086.44
with my mobile

8081.76 --> 8090.0
phone which is changed this

8086.44 --> 8093.199
year into a 4G device because the 3G

8090.0 --> 8097.84
devices refused to work they shut it

8093.199 --> 8100.04
off and yeah I always have my mobile

8097.84 --> 8104.400000000001
pretty much what is

8100.04 --> 8107.5199999999995
it one a little over one meter away from

8104.4 --> 8109.679
me where I sleep and that might be

8107.52 --> 8111.8
having a detrimental influence that

8109.679 --> 8114.599
started to be compound that started to

8111.8 --> 8117.8
compound so I'm going to try to now

8114.599 --> 8122.119000000001
sleep while having my mobile phone a bit

8117.8 --> 8127.04
more away let's say 2 and A2 3 m away

8122.119 --> 8129.28
from me and hopefully that will keep

8127.04 --> 8132.119
helping and get me a lot of my

8129.28 --> 8132.119
concentration

8149.92 --> 8156.119
back

8152.32 --> 8156.119
anyway don't forget to rogans up the

8157.0 --> 8161.04
stream if you appreciated

8179.92 --> 8182.92
it

8183.28 --> 8186.74
and

8184.159 --> 8188.159
again hey debatable

8186.74 --> 8192.559
[Music]

8188.159 --> 8195.719
D sorry you're late no we appreciate

8192.559 --> 8198.16
it put your phone in the Faraday

8195.719 --> 8201.08
cage I've been thinking about that I

8198.16 --> 8201.08
don't really have

8203.639 --> 8209.839999999998
one but if this is really like a

8206.76 --> 8212.84
continual problem I may have to get one

8209.84 --> 8212.84
somehow

8215.08 --> 8218.8
like a a blocket pocket or

8228.88 --> 8235.679
something but usually just more

8232.16 --> 8239.319
proximity tends to help and that's why

8235.679 --> 8242.319
well I'm just now testing it

8239.319 --> 8245.319
basically triple the distance between my

8242.319 --> 8249.599
phone and myself while I

8245.319 --> 8249.599
sleep and I feel that's already

8255.96 --> 8263.08
helping cuz like proximity help like

8259.16 --> 8265.359
really matters it it matters a lot it's

8263.08 --> 8265.359
like

8267.519 --> 8276.28
this like a halflife thing like

8272.479 --> 8279.199999999999
every like there a distance between the

8276.28 --> 8280.479000000001
device and you as an influence if you

8279.2 --> 8284.84
have that

8280.479 --> 8287.119999999999
distance like it doubles in its

8284.84 --> 8289.2
influence to the point that if you're

8287.12 --> 8290.800000000001
right next to it like the influence is

8289.2 --> 8294.399000000001
just

8290.8 --> 8297.119999999999
massive it's really bad to like have

8294.399 --> 8301.16
your phone stick to your head basically

8297.12 --> 8305.04
that's just a horrendous influence that

8301.16 --> 8307.039999999999
can potentially I'm not a doctor can

8305.04 --> 8309.599
potentially like cause brain cancer and

8307.04 --> 8311.639000000001
everything but probably will just create

8309.599 --> 8313.84
massive headaches before it even gets to

8311.639 --> 8313.839999999998
that

8318.08 --> 8328.12
point aluminum foil around the Fone

8323.439 --> 8328.12
okay that's that's

8329.719 --> 8332.719
funny

8333.519 --> 8337.639000000001
but uh yeah I may have like some kind of

8335.92 --> 8343.319
blocket pocket

8337.639 --> 8343.319
thing do I have a smartphone no no no

8346.16 --> 8354.0
no but I mean it's a 4G phone and it'll

8350.519 --> 8356.2
still do pings

8354.0 --> 8358.8
right

8356.2 --> 8362.719000000001
so I'm aware that that does keep

8358.8 --> 8362.719
happening throughout the night

8389.64 --> 8392.64
ah

8406.359 --> 8410.2
what's up with the rogans today I see so

8408.359 --> 8416.04
many people in the

8410.2 --> 8416.04
chat only says two two up votes what is

8416.96 --> 8422.64
this maybe they just not registering

8419.96 --> 8422.64
it's weird

8449.64 --> 8452.64
for

8479.56 --> 8482.56
for

8509.52 --> 8512.52
e

8539.52 --> 8544.61
what

8541.42 --> 8544.61
[Music]

8569.439 --> 8572.439
e

8599.319 --> 8604.56
can put your phone in the

8601.64 --> 8607.64
microwave okay debatable D I guess I

8604.56 --> 8610.96
could do that but I mean a microwave is

8607.64 --> 8610.96
all the way downstair

8620.13 --> 8625.599999999999
[Music]

8622.52 --> 8629.04
so yeah and if somebody turns it on your

8625.6 --> 8629.04
your telephone is

8629.439 --> 8632.439
busted

8636.12 --> 8640.2
now I'll just settle for like a blocket

8638.2 --> 8642.960000000001
pocket thing or something that that

8640.2 --> 8642.960000000001
would do just

8647.08 --> 8651.139
[Music]

8648.09 --> 8651.139000000001
[Applause]

8659.359 --> 8662.359
fine

8665.66 --> 8670.979
[Applause]

8678.399 --> 8682.84
what about 4G not from my

8681.319 --> 8685.76
phone

8682.84 --> 8687.64
Bu from the towers well they're at a

8685.76 --> 8691.0
great distance debatable

8687.64 --> 8693.72
D again the distance

8691.0 --> 8693.72
really

8695.359 --> 8700.6
matters I mean we're

8697.92 --> 8702.88
surrounded by phone towers giving

8700.6 --> 8705.16
signals all over the place there's no

8702.88 --> 8709.839999999998
way to prevent that unless you want to

8705.16 --> 8712.479
like yeah aluminum foil your entire room

8709.84 --> 8715.6
and like create this big Faraday

8712.479 --> 8719.358999999999
cage but yeah I don't really have that

8715.6 --> 8721.56
option but the real damage is done in

8719.359 --> 8724.12
close proximity

8721.56 --> 8727.76
to these devices that send these signals

8724.12 --> 8729.399000000001
so for me my phone is basically the

8727.76 --> 8732.359
biggest contributor the biggest

8729.399 --> 8734.64
influencer because it is close to me

8732.359 --> 8739.92
everybody else here having a phone and

8734.64 --> 8745.88
the wifi device is further away from

8739.92 --> 8745.88
me so yeah it's there it's just not that

8749.24 --> 8752.24
impactful

8779.24 --> 8782.24
for

8806.24 --> 8812.24
[Music]

8809.24 --> 8812.24
for

8837.12 --> 8842.0
your uncle has lined his trucker cap and

8840.76 --> 8846.08
his

8842.0 --> 8851.64
underpants inside of his Le

8846.08 --> 8851.64
jacket that seems pretty good

8856.64 --> 8861.84
idea I especially if you do have like a

8859.92 --> 8865.439
smartphone that you have with you all

8861.84 --> 8869.52
day then yeah you want as much

8865.439 --> 8872.12
protection against that very device you

8869.52 --> 8872.12
can

8873.439 --> 8877.399
I mean I don't carry a smartphone with

8875.6 --> 8880.880000000001
me all the

8877.399 --> 8883.88
time so I don't feel like I need that

8880.88 --> 8886.278999999999
much protection also like this location

8883.88 --> 8889.358999999999
is relatively distant to any type of

8886.279 --> 8891.279
phone towers that are around but they're

8889.359 --> 8893.68
all like at a

8891.279 --> 8895.279
distance it's almost like I'm in the

8893.68 --> 8898.720000000001
middle of

8895.279 --> 8902.479000000001
like in the middle of it right in in a

8898.72 --> 8902.479
point where there's the least of

8903.72 --> 8909.88
it and I I really like the location

8906.84 --> 8913.92
because of that cuz I am like away from

8909.88 --> 8916.96
all the phone towers like I'd never ever

8913.92 --> 8918.88
under any circumstance move into a an

8916.96 --> 8922.358999999999
apartment where there was like a phone

8918.88 --> 8924.8
tower on top of the building never that

8922.359 --> 8924.800000000001
would be a

8929.04 --> 8932.04
disaster

8946.76 --> 8954.75
[Music]

8959.76 --> 8962.399
what the the

8967.01 --> 8970.1

hell

9018.96 --> 9021.96

9108.84 --> 9111.84
okay

9114.3 --> 9117.56
[Applause]

9150.479 --> 9154.76
right I've been going for two and a half

9152.04 --> 9157.92
hours already thinking about maneuvering

9154.76 --> 9157.92
towards routing out the

9158.2 --> 9165.240000000002
show it's been a very intense themed

9162.88 --> 9165.24
show

9168.84 --> 9171.84
today

9189.89 --> 9192.958999999999
[Applause]

9198.76 --> 9202.52
for

9200.479 --> 9206.88
but yeah I think that maybe I'll just

9202.52 --> 9209.640000000001
need to leave it with the

9206.88 --> 9213.599999999999
message that I've given and like Let It

9209.64 --> 9213.599999999999
All sink in and again don't be

9219.08 --> 9225.96
afraid things will be just

9223.16 --> 9228.72
fine even if

9225.96 --> 9231.96
unexpected dark events May

9228.72 --> 9233.56
happen it's more likely to be born out

9231.96 --> 9236.16
of

9233.56 --> 9239.72
desperation than out of

9236.16 --> 9242.56
some conceptual imminent Doom which I

9239.72 --> 9242.56
don't believe is

9244.76 --> 9250.479
