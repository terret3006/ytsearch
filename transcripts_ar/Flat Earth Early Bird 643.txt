uh so yeah the

80.799 --> 84.72000000000001
weather today unexpectedly kind of took

82.96 --> 88.479
a turn

84.72 --> 90.88
it's actually kind of nice did not see

88.479 --> 92.799
that coming

90.88 --> 95.83999999999999
yeah it looks very cloudy still over

92.799 --> 97.92
there and it has rained some

95.84 --> 100.0
but yeah it's actually been kind of nice

97.92 --> 102.399
and warm

100.0 --> 104.0
i guess probably surprise people if i

102.399 --> 107.36
told them that i went out

104.0 --> 109.6
just in my t-shirt uh top

107.36 --> 111.84
clothing because of course i'm gonna

109.6 --> 115.03999999999999
wear pants it's ridiculous but

111.84 --> 117.84
just t-shirt and it was fine

115.04 --> 118.799
it was a little fresh but it was much

117.84 --> 122.07900000000001
better than

118.799 --> 125.52000000000001
yeah yesterday and

122.079 --> 127.36
yeah i feel great by the way for those

125.52 --> 130.72
who wondering

127.36 --> 134.08
i would like to ask certain

130.72 --> 138.239
loyal fans to please

134.08 --> 140.64000000000001
not ask me if i'm okay

138.239 --> 141.44
if i don't manage to start exactly on

140.64 --> 142.79999999999998
time because

141.44 --> 144.8
when you're gonna ask that that's

142.8 --> 145.44
exactly when i'm starting up and that

144.8 --> 148.4
makes it

145.44 --> 149.599
more confusing so please don't do that

148.4 --> 153.20000000000002
if i'm a little late

149.599 --> 155.67999999999998
doesn't mean anything anything

153.2 --> 156.56
you know look if for after like half an

155.68 --> 159.59900000000002
hour

156.56 --> 160.72
i'm not there okay then i'd get worried

159.599 --> 163.76
maybe

160.72 --> 167.44
but yeah look these

163.76 --> 170.64
these days i'm late very often so

167.44 --> 171.84
please don't ask no you're you're just

170.64 --> 175.51899999999998
caring but it

171.84 --> 178.959
actually gets kind of in the way so

175.519 --> 185.84
uh right so i got

178.959 --> 185.84
green tea and tamara coffee with me

188.0 --> 194.48
yeah and i feel really good actually

191.2 --> 198.39999999999998
uh because i have slept

194.48 --> 200.04

205.36 --> 210.0
i i got under the shower yesterday i

207.92 --> 212.48
don't know how i managed to

210.0 --> 214.08
postpone that for so long i still wash

212.48 --> 215.76
my feet and all that of course but yeah

214.08 --> 219.36
i should have probably

215.76 --> 222.159
been as sick as as i was taking a good

219.36 --> 222.15900000000002
shower damn it

224.08 --> 228.799
stuff falling behind i should have just

227.519 --> 232.48000000000002

really needed to sleep i actually didn't

253.2 --> 256.4
take a whole

254.48 --> 257.84
load of supplements that i typically

256.4 --> 259.919
normally do

257.84 --> 260.959
right before going to bed and that does

259.919 --> 264.08
help

260.959 --> 267.199
but i just felt like no

264.08 --> 269.68
i've had proper dinner

267.199 --> 270.479
and i'm just gonna do it like this just

269.68 --> 274.88

270.479 --> 278.0
uh what is it the intestinal flora

274.88 --> 281.04
situation what is it yeah one of those

278.0 --> 284.16
things just that nothing else leave it

281.04 --> 286.40000000000003
and sleep with that and i really feel

284.16 --> 287.44
really good this morning like really

286.4 --> 290.0
good

287.44 --> 292.0
it's just like the contrast yes it is

290.0 --> 295.12
just insane

292.0 --> 298.32
i feel really strong

295.12 --> 300.24
like and yeah that showed

298.32 --> 302.71999999999997
because there were some girls that had

300.24 --> 307.28000000000003
kind of like twitch

302.72 --> 310.88000000000005
even in my presence

307.28 --> 314.23999999999995
that means that my presence is very

310.88 --> 317.36
there i guess the the white t-shirt also

314.24 --> 320.24
does help i don't know what it is

317.36 --> 320.56
ah yes i noticed good servant thank you

320.24 --> 324.32
for

320.56 --> 326.8
sharing the show on well on my platforms

324.32 --> 327.68
you know what i would don't mind if you

326.8 --> 330.88
do that

327.68 --> 333.199
at all because i tend to forget that

330.88 --> 334.32
so i don't mind if you actually share my

333.199 --> 337.6
show but

334.32 --> 340.71999999999997
however if you can please

337.6 --> 342.72
also in the text address and you can

340.72 --> 344.32000000000005
edit this afterwards remember with the

342.72 --> 347.44000000000005
three dots

344.32 --> 350.71999999999997
to the side you can edit it add in

347.44 --> 353.6
the actual title because when you

350.72 --> 353.91900000000004
share a link like to a news article it

353.6 --> 357.28000000000003
all

353.919 --> 359.52
shows you know it all shows up

357.28 --> 361.84
or youtube channel apparently even does

359.52 --> 364.479
it i don't know why

361.84 --> 366.96
but if you just put in the youtube link

364.479 --> 370.08
it just shows the link it doesn't even

366.96 --> 373.19899999999996
say what it is you're sharing

370.08 --> 374.08
so in skype if you're gonna share the

373.199 --> 377.039
link then please

374.08 --> 377.52
also put a bit of text on top of it

377.039 --> 379.59999999999997
saying

377.52 --> 383.12
the title of what it is the early word

379.6 --> 385.84000000000003
show flat earth early bird number 643

383.12 --> 387.759
that would help a lot for oversight you

385.84 --> 390.0
know because otherwise it's like oh

387.759 --> 392.08000000000004
let's see one week ago where was that

390.0 --> 393.919
link and then it's all just a pile of

392.08 --> 395.68
codes and you have no you have to click

393.919 --> 398.96
it all to figure out what it is

395.68 --> 403.68
it's very annoying so please

398.96 --> 403.68
if you're gonna share the show on skype

403.759 --> 409.36
then also add the text what it is

407.199 --> 410.639
on top of just the link that would be

409.36 --> 415.28000000000003
very helpful

410.639 --> 415.28000000000003
uh anyway let's see who is in chat

415.84 --> 422.96
good servant was first obamacal

419.599 --> 426.08
and that's it i guess for now

422.96 --> 429.12
hope to see more people coming in it's

426.08 --> 432.639
friday the 28th

429.12 --> 436.96
of august this is the last friday uh

432.639 --> 440.479
this august yeah

436.96 --> 440.479
how that summer flew by

443.039 --> 449.28
it was really fast hey adam meekin

446.08 --> 450.4
yeah by the way uh yesterday's flat

449.28 --> 454.4
earth debate

450.4 --> 456.71999999999997
was really really good

454.4 --> 457.919
and the after show too man it was so

456.72 --> 460.72
powerful

457.919 --> 461.28
with so much rich detail i even got to

460.72 --> 465.44000000000005
basically

461.28 --> 468.479
put out some very deep

465.44 --> 470.08
thoughtful conceptions about terrestrial

468.479 --> 472.0
fraction what would be the natural

470.08 --> 473.599
consequences if terrestrial refraction

472.0 --> 476.56
was actually there

473.599 --> 477.039
and everybody yeah really hooked in on

476.56 --> 480.72
it and

477.039 --> 485.039
it was just a great dynamic

480.72 --> 485.03900000000004
show i really liked it

488.96 --> 494.56
man my youtube has a delay

492.0 --> 497.199
that's like over a minute delay that's

494.56 --> 497.199
ridiculous

500.8 --> 504.879
because i do keep track of what's going

503.199 --> 508.96000000000004
on and sometimes it just goes like

504.879 --> 510.40000000000003
this i don't know why it does that

508.96 --> 512.399
i don't know if you guys are getting

510.4 --> 514.7189999999999
that too or if it's just firefox or

512.399 --> 514.719
something

516.24 --> 523.919
uh hey patricia dockery

520.32 --> 523.9190000000001

till i got into the mountains yeah yeah

531.68 --> 534.4799999999999
yeah you got uh yeah the satellite hit

533.92 --> 537.36
behind

534.48 --> 538.64
the mountains didn't like you anymore i

537.36 --> 541.2
know

538.64 --> 549.8389999999999
but yeah beyond that point to the rest

541.2 --> 549.839
of the hangout it was all great

555.519 --> 559.519
wow well tiny wumbo if you want to go

558.72 --> 562.88
and watch

559.519 --> 566.72
fighter flight stream

562.88 --> 570.64
40 hours you go ahead

566.72 --> 572.72
i'm i'm going to stick to my own show

570.64 --> 575.519
jesus chris why would you even torture

572.72 --> 577.839
yourself sitting through that

575.519 --> 577.839
god

583.44 --> 590.0
you know the worst the globers get

586.56 --> 593.04
and the globe earth hang out

590.0 --> 596.0
people worse they're going to get

593.04 --> 596.959
it's it's going to get at some point all

596.0 --> 599.519
these people that

596.959 --> 600.16
hook into this that like this they're

599.519 --> 604.72
going to get

600.16 --> 606.079
similar things to like gender dysphoria

604.72 --> 609.36
but it's going to be like globe

606.079 --> 612.3199999999999
dysphoria once it really snaps through

609.36 --> 613.92
what the [ __ ] is going on that they're

612.32 --> 617.36
actually liking some

613.92 --> 621.1999999999999
really sick people

617.36 --> 622.88
pathological liars that lie to them too

621.2 --> 623.9200000000001
they lie to themselves they lie to

622.88 --> 626.88
others

623.92 --> 628.24
and and they feel it they cognitively

626.88 --> 630.32
don't

628.24 --> 631.279
absolutely realize they keep it away but

630.32 --> 633.839
they feel it

631.279 --> 636.079
they're just gushing liars i can't

633.839 --> 638.5600000000001
believe that people would stick to that

636.079 --> 639.4399999999999
it's going to be such a dysphoria once

638.56 --> 641.3599999999999
once you snap

639.44 --> 643.2790000000001
out of that after having liked it for so

641.36 --> 644.88
long it's incredible

643.279 --> 647.36
it's going to be just like gendered is

644.88 --> 650.399
for those people that

647.36 --> 652.64
you know trans kids and all and so oh

650.399 --> 655.36
it's so glorious and nice and then they

652.64 --> 657.279
yeah get to adulthood and it's like [ __ ]

655.36 --> 659.76
i'm [ __ ]

657.279 --> 660.8
i don't know what the [ __ ] i am anymore

659.76 --> 663.2
was not what

660.8 --> 664.079
was said and yeah all these surgeries

663.2 --> 666.0
don't work

664.079 --> 667.519
it doesn't make me what i thought it was

666.0 --> 671.12
going to be and

667.519 --> 671.12
and the hormones and ugh

672.079 --> 677.04
that happens a lot you know it's already

675.68 --> 680.2399999999999
happening

677.04 --> 681.04
like right now and five years ago and

680.24 --> 682.8
[ __ ] you know

681.04 --> 684.48
people who have done transgender

682.8 --> 687.76
operations

684.48 --> 690.24
that that's way before that's not just a

687.76 --> 692.0
21st century thing even though they

690.24 --> 694.8
started to politically

692.0 --> 695.12
push it but before that people did that

694.8 --> 697.5999999999999
too

695.12 --> 699.44
and they too had freaking gender

697.6 --> 701.279
dysphoria after some time

699.44 --> 704.1600000000001
well guess what this is gonna happen i

701.279 --> 708.24
predict with the globe as well

704.16 --> 713.04
i do enjoy a dumpster fire though

708.24 --> 717.6800000000001
okay mind of god isn't oh jesus

713.04 --> 721.12
oh god so it's like a jose

717.68 --> 724.16
nonsense fest then i guess

721.12 --> 725.839
all right okay that explains got a bit

724.16 --> 728.0
of respect back if you're just gonna

725.839 --> 731.519
watch it to see it burn and i

728.0 --> 734.56
you'd enjoy that okay okay

731.519 --> 738.0
i wouldn't waste my time on that [ __ ]

734.56 --> 738.0
it's too nauseating

746.32 --> 749.519
he is just reaching now to stay relevant

748.639 --> 752.5600000000001
so yeah his

749.519 --> 755.839
marathon for some kind of promotion

752.56 --> 759.279
but he has such a large channel

755.839 --> 761.44
with so many real viewers he is so

759.279 --> 765.04
popular why would he

761.44 --> 767.6800000000001
need to stay relevant he has so many

765.04 --> 772.079
subscribers doesn't that mean he's very

767.68 --> 774.6389999999999
relevant right

772.079 --> 775.279
why would he need to do a marathon to

774.639 --> 778.72
stay

775.279 --> 778.72
relevant could it be because

780.639 --> 787.92
yeah fake subscribers just a lot of

784.839 --> 790.0790000000001
idiots no

787.92 --> 790.079
i

791.12 --> 795.04
i'm pretty damn sure that his subscriber

794.639 --> 797.519
base

795.04 --> 798.079
that's not all real guaranteed not that

797.519 --> 800.399
he

798.079 --> 802.959
would like pay for subscribe maybe you

800.399 --> 806.079
would i don't really care

802.959 --> 809.5189999999999
you're just an idiot if you do it anyway

806.079 --> 811.12
but i bet you know just because of

809.519 --> 814.24
globers out there that don't even have

811.12 --> 816.88
their own channel necessarily they would

814.24 --> 818.32
definitely send fake subscribers over to

816.88 --> 821.199
these channels because they

818.32 --> 823.519
have to be bigger than for example

821.199 --> 826.7199999999999
little old irwin here

823.519 --> 829.92
or or nathan oakley that no

826.72 --> 832.639
there can't be smaller

829.92 --> 833.36
than us that's impossible because the

832.639 --> 836.72
globe

833.36 --> 839.92
is real and people it's their

836.72 --> 841.279
personal delusional trust feeling in

839.92 --> 844.079
society

841.279 --> 845.92
that if it just seems like flat earth is

844.079 --> 847.8389999999999
more popular than the globe then their

845.92 --> 848.7199999999999
heart breaks so they will do whatever

847.839 --> 852.9590000000001
they can

848.72 --> 856.24
spend money to to themselves

852.959 --> 856.88
fake that these freaking [ __ ] global

856.24 --> 860.5600000000001
channels

856.88 --> 862.56
are more popular to themselves

860.56 --> 864.399
it's not even to the world to themselves

862.56 --> 866.3199999999999
just give them the feeling no no it's

864.399 --> 869.36
okay

866.32 --> 872.24
and that's how desperate

869.36 --> 872.88
some of these globers are out there not

872.24 --> 875.04
saying

872.88 --> 878.0
fight the flat earth himself he's just a

875.04 --> 881.36
complete buffoon

878.0 --> 884.0
i wouldn't even describe

881.36 --> 885.44
yeah enough consciousness to even

884.0 --> 888.639
conceive of any of that

885.44 --> 888.639
he is too dumb

888.959 --> 892.2399999999999
to go above a certain naivety level it's

891.92 --> 899.8389999999999
too

892.24 --> 899.839
dumb like in many ways

900.24 --> 906.24
tiny wumbo mark sergeant has over 9 89

904.0 --> 909.92
000 subscribe did he buy them

906.24 --> 911.6
no he just pretty much single handedly

909.92 --> 913.36
started the flat earth movement on

911.6 --> 916.0
youtube

913.36 --> 916.8000000000001
and put himself out there in media

916.0 --> 920.399
against all

916.8 --> 924.399
odds against all risk even if he knew

920.399 --> 928.16
he was going to be ridiculed so yeah

924.399 --> 932.32
mark sargent has done a lot

928.16 --> 934.399
a lot and realistically

932.32 --> 937.12
he should have like over a million

934.399 --> 937.12
subscribers

938.24 --> 941.839
but yeah who cares

948.399 --> 953.44
he's just more known he's more wide he's

951.199 --> 953.4399999999999
more

953.6 --> 958.639
i call that more pc it's not

956.639 --> 960.16
terminology i typically would like to

958.639 --> 963.199
compare people with

960.16 --> 965.199
but he is he's very aware of that

963.199 --> 966.8
even kind of played into it fool around

965.199 --> 970.3599999999999
with it

966.8 --> 974.24
neutral but he's always been very

970.36 --> 975.6800000000001
very adaptive in his social demeanor

974.24 --> 978.8
towards the wider public

975.68 --> 982.079
always that's his strategy and his

978.8 --> 984.079
natural tendency as a person

982.079 --> 986.079
so yeah it's not surprising that he has

984.079 --> 996.0
a much wider subscriber base than

986.079 --> 997.8389999999999
yeah me or nathan no surprise at all

996.0 --> 999.92
no tiny one where you have not outstayed

997.839 --> 1002.9590000000001
you're welcome

999.92 --> 1005.759
dude you can be wrong

1002.959 --> 1006.8
like 10 times in a row that's that's

1005.759 --> 1008.72
okay

1006.8 --> 1010.4799999999999
because it's your natural thought you're

1008.72 --> 1012.72
not here

1010.48 --> 1014.32
you're wrong you're stupid troll but

1012.72 --> 1016.5600000000001
flat earthers are stupid

1014.32 --> 1018.399
no no you're not doing that you're just

1016.56 --> 1021.04
saying something that you think of

1018.399 --> 1021.68
and that's a good idea i i appreciate

1021.04 --> 1024.0
about that

1021.68 --> 1025.1989999999998
and there's no negative charge on those

1024.0 --> 1026.959
sentences

1025.199 --> 1028.72
so that's perfectly fine you're not

1026.959 --> 1029.52
outstage you're welcome you're just

1028.72 --> 1034.319
wrong

1029.52 --> 1038.319
but that's okay i used to be wrong a lot

1034.319 --> 1040.559
20 years ago with nobody out there to

1038.319 --> 1042.079
even point that out to me because they

1040.559 --> 1044.3999999999999
didn't know

1042.079 --> 1044.3999999999999
right

1046.079 --> 1050.1599999999999
and some of them that did know refused

1048.559 --> 1052.48
to point it out

1050.16 --> 1053.52
because then i would get triggered and i

1052.48 --> 1055.76
would yeah

1053.52 --> 1058.799
be extremely unpleasant to them without

1055.76 --> 1058.799
even realizing it

1060.08 --> 1063.6789999999999
but yeah it's 20 years later now and i'm

1062.48 --> 1067.84
a completely

1063.679 --> 1067.8400000000001
different person at it

1068.08 --> 1071.6789999999999
yeah that's right patricia dockery

1069.919 --> 1072.24
youtube is full of crap with their

1071.679 --> 1075.3600000000001
numbers

1072.24 --> 1076.08
and they rig numbers like they rigged my

1075.36 --> 1079.4399999999998
show

1076.08 --> 1082.48
votes for no damn reason

1079.44 --> 1086.0
although they seem to have

1082.48 --> 1088.72
yeah ceased doing that

1086.0 --> 1091.12
yesterday showed i think let's see where

1088.72 --> 1091.1200000000001
it's at

1093.36 --> 1098.32
yeah right exactly my yesterday show has

1096.08 --> 1102.72
16 up votes

1098.32 --> 1105.6789999999999
so see it's just weird and random

1102.72 --> 1106.48
when a troll feels like it he just gets

1105.679 --> 1108.72
access to

1106.48 --> 1109.52
levers that he should not have access to

1108.72 --> 1112.96
or something

1109.52 --> 1114.24
and starts raking my my [ __ ] because he

1112.96 --> 1119.2
can

1114.24 --> 1119.2
and youtube allows that to happen

1120.24 --> 1125.1200000000001
you know i don't know if it's people

1122.48 --> 1125.679
inside youtube that are baller pieces of

1125.12 --> 1127.9189999999999
[ __ ]

1125.679 --> 1129.919
that are abusing their political power

1127.919 --> 1133.919
like all pieces of [ __ ]

1129.919 --> 1136.0
and sjws and blm [ __ ] pieces of [ __ ]

1133.919 --> 1137.679
garbage people out there because there's

1136.0 --> 1140.559
a lot of them they've been encouraged to

1137.679 --> 1143.2
turn themselves into garbage people

1140.559 --> 1145.44
and they are and they only seek [ __ ]

1143.2 --> 1148.48
power abuse that's the only thing they

1145.44 --> 1150.64
are focused at so it could be them

1148.48 --> 1151.76
or it's literally ballers that just hang

1150.64 --> 1155.5200000000002
around

1151.76 --> 1157.84
that ha are decent with

1155.52 --> 1161.12
computer programs and have figured out

1157.84 --> 1163.6
how to rig youtube itself

1161.12 --> 1164.3999999999999
as an outsider and youtube just doesn't

1163.6 --> 1166.1599999999999
give a [ __ ]

1164.4 --> 1169.039
that could be the case as well i don't

1166.16 --> 1169.52
know nobody has admitted yet that yeah

1169.039 --> 1172.16
it's me

1169.52 --> 1174.16
i i'm the one that's rigging your shows

1172.16 --> 1176.4
nobody said that

1174.16 --> 1178.72
except if they were just trolling to try

1176.4 --> 1182.96
and fool me

1178.72 --> 1182.96
so i don't know exactly who it is

1190.64 --> 1194.88
now it took three years actually so

1193.039 --> 1198.4
you're wrong

1194.88 --> 1202.48
and i don't hide behind nathan

1198.4 --> 1205.8400000000001
colon literal

1202.48 --> 1207.1200000000001
thing that is around a piece of [ __ ]

1205.84 --> 1210.559
before it gets dumped

1207.12 --> 1211.84
yeah you colon right i don't hide behind

1210.559 --> 1215.6
nathan

1211.84 --> 1218.799
i'm a guy that freaking addresses nathan

1215.6 --> 1222.0
i i break the standard

1218.799 --> 1225.6
i am the one that [ __ ] confronts

1222.0 --> 1230.24
qe when i think he's wrong yeah

1225.6 --> 1232.08
yeah what are you [ __ ] talking about

1230.24 --> 1235.84
hiding behind i don't hide behind

1232.08 --> 1235.84
anything [ __ ]

1241.039 --> 1246.32
i simply respect nathan and i like his

1243.919 --> 1246.3200000000002
style

1246.4 --> 1253.76
i share my disdain and disgust

1250.159 --> 1256.7990000000002
over pieces of [ __ ] people like you

1253.76 --> 1260.32
literal colon a piece of [ __ ]

1256.799 --> 1263.84
people you that's you

1260.32 --> 1263.84
you're a walking turd

1264.24 --> 1268.559
and i have as much disdain for that

1267.36 --> 1272.0
those types

1268.559 --> 1275.6789999999999
as nathan does so i enjoy when he

1272.0 --> 1278.48
crushes people like you gives you the

1275.679 --> 1281.2800000000002
verbal treatment that you deserve

1278.48 --> 1284.0
i like that about nathan i enjoy it i

1281.28 --> 1288.72
wouldn't want to miss it

1284.0 --> 1292.32
yeah it's about you

1288.72 --> 1295.44
but you people being out there

1292.32 --> 1299.76
and just spreading around your mental

1295.44 --> 1301.6000000000001
and social garbage over the entire world

1299.76 --> 1303.679
and everybody just lets you because

1301.6 --> 1304.1589999999999
that's normal now because the government

1303.679 --> 1307.76
is

1304.159 --> 1311.2
garbage as well and when a government is

1307.76 --> 1314.72
garbage then garbage is what you get

1311.2 --> 1318.159
everywhere everybody takes example

1314.72 --> 1319.679
to exemplary garbage so that's what you

1318.159 --> 1322.159
get and then you get people like you

1319.679 --> 1322.159
colon

1323.2 --> 1326.88
garbage people all day that are just

1325.84 --> 1329.36

other people down that aren't straight

1329.36 --> 1334.3999999999999
forward garbage that actually say

1331.52 --> 1335.039
exactly what they think honestly that

1334.4 --> 1336.96
don't

1335.039 --> 1338.1589999999999
in their back of their mind politicize

1336.96 --> 1340.48
[ __ ] to try to

1338.159 --> 1341.2
fit in some statistics so they can get a

1340.48 --> 1344.159
little bit more

1341.2 --> 1346.0800000000002
a little bit more money yeah yeah you

1344.159 --> 1347.0390000000002

1362.72 --> 1366.559
by corporations and governments and you

1365.44 --> 1370.96
let it all happen

that you can spend your entire life

your spirit is left and then you realize

1438.72 --> 1442.64
oh [ __ ]

1439.6 --> 1443.4399999999998
oh [ __ ] i didn't hang on to the right

1442.64 --> 1446.4
thing

1443.44 --> 1448.48
i hang on to a lie all my life and that

1446.4 --> 1450.8600000000001
means now that it's slipping away i'm

[Music]

1470.84 --> 1473.84
coming

1476.15 --> 1479.219
[Music]

1485.12 --> 1488.3999999999999
it's good to be merciless

1489.12 --> 1496.08
gives you so much space inside

1493.039 --> 1496.08
where you really need it

1497.039 --> 1504.4
you don't make yourself endure

1501.279 --> 1505.279
vile and disgusting [ __ ] from other

1504.4 --> 1507.52
people

1505.279 --> 1508.72
because you think it is more strategical

1507.52 --> 1512.84
to do that

1508.72 --> 1517.52
to not be noticed and not cause a ruckus

1512.84 --> 1521.1999999999998
yeah it's good to be merciless

1517.52 --> 1525.12
merciless is also discipline

1521.2 --> 1528.4
and i'm not talking about no mercy

1525.12 --> 1530.6399999999999
at all you know no don't just

1528.4 --> 1532.3200000000002
say like okay either you're dead or

1530.64 --> 1533.039
you're not dead or something in the

1532.32 --> 1537.2
military

1533.039 --> 1541.52
that's not no no talking about

1537.2 --> 1544.64
don't let terrible behavior slip by

1541.52 --> 1548.24
weigh it all the whole thing

1544.64 --> 1550.7990000000002
be real that's what i call merciless

1548.24 --> 1553.6
i guess it's technically not correct the

1550.799 --> 1553.6
correct word

1553.84 --> 1561.6789999999999
it's just that that's kind of been

1557.919 --> 1562.5590000000002
culturally dragged in its place it's

1561.679 --> 1566.5590000000002
like

1562.559 --> 1569.44
oh why are you so mean

1566.559 --> 1571.84
by not outright tolerating that

1569.44 --> 1574.799
disgusting behavior from that

1571.84 --> 1574.799
person that

1576.559 --> 1579.6789999999999
and i think that feeling wise a lot of

1578.48 --> 1585.6
people

1579.679 --> 1588.72
that do then straightforward get very

1585.6 --> 1591.12
hard on on such people on

1588.72 --> 1593.1200000000001
in such situations would be regarded as

1591.12 --> 1596.1589999999999
kind of merciless

1593.12 --> 1598.6399999999999
because like uh why is he like that when

1596.159 --> 1600.24
everybody is it's normal right why would

1598.64 --> 1606.0
he do that

1600.24 --> 1612.159
ah yeah it's because it's unacceptable

1606.0 --> 1615.76
and the fact that it has been societally

1612.159 --> 1619.0390000000002
just dilapidated like this that it's now

1615.76 --> 1621.039
normal to endure and tolerate demonic

1619.039 --> 1622.1589999999999
disgusting behavior and just let your

1621.039 --> 1625.279
mind slip

1622.159 --> 1627.8400000000001
into it right that's

1625.279 --> 1627.84
intolerable

1629.279 --> 1633.52
it's one of those things i talked about

1630.96 --> 1635.679
yesterday it's one of those things that

1633.52 --> 1637.76
yeah after 20 years it's still

1635.679 --> 1640.88
intolerable

1637.76 --> 1643.919
still unacceptable

1640.88 --> 1643.919
it's only grown worse

1644.159 --> 1647.44
i have less patience left for such

1646.64 --> 1650.88
things

1647.44 --> 1653.279
because i was kind of like

1650.88 --> 1654.0
passive resistant to it first you know i

1653.279 --> 1655.679
was like no

1654.0 --> 1657.44
i'm not going to talk about it i'm not

1655.679 --> 1658.0800000000002
going to go along with it but i'm not

1657.44 --> 1661.76
going to go

1658.08 --> 1664.0
speak against it well did that turn out

1661.76 --> 1666.32
to be completely useless

1664.0 --> 1668.64
because then i was just ignored and i

1666.32 --> 1670.1589999999999
didn't have any influence or impact i

1668.64 --> 1672.72
didn't change anything it still

1670.159 --> 1674.0
all happened around me so yeah

1672.72 --> 1677.2
retrospect that was

1674.0 --> 1679.6
a bad strategy call on my part on the

1677.2 --> 1682.88
other hand i did not have a lot of

1679.6 --> 1683.84
personal courage to even go out and

1682.88 --> 1686.88
confront

1683.84 --> 1689.6
people in the world like that

1686.88 --> 1691.1200000000001
i think i've built up much more strength

1689.6 --> 1693.6789999999999
in that department

1691.12 --> 1696.0
right that i am very solid in my

1693.679 --> 1699.52
position and i can confront a person

1696.0 --> 1699.52
face to face with that

1699.84 --> 1703.6
much more fearless like that

1708.88 --> 1713.2
yeah [ __ ] off your [ __ ]

1715.6 --> 1725.84
eat [ __ ]

1734.08 --> 1744.1589999999999
all right

1739.6 --> 1749.36
no good servant don't he's not going to

1744.159 --> 1749.3600000000001
and even if he is it's none of your

1750.84 --> 1753.84
business

1758.64 --> 1762.0
now he doesn't have any comebacks he's

1760.32 --> 1765.4399999999998
just reasserting the same

1762.0 --> 1765.44
lies over and over again

1765.6 --> 1769.76
all right but yeah people that inner are

1768.08 --> 1772.399
in hell

1769.76 --> 1772.799
don't waste your end it's insulting to

1772.399 --> 1775.76
me

1772.799 --> 1777.039
actually if you think oh i want him to

1775.76 --> 1780.64
go to heaven no

1777.039 --> 1783.44
no why are you literally

1780.64 --> 1784.3990000000001
gushing your positive energy and dumping

1783.44 --> 1788.3990000000001
it

1784.399 --> 1794.1589999999999
on a poisonous turd don't do that

1788.399 --> 1796.7199999999998
no let it go to hell let it go

1794.159 --> 1799.2
if they're gonna be a little seed in

1796.72 --> 1800.3990000000001
that turd that is poison resistant and a

1799.2 --> 1803.919
plant comes out of it

1800.399 --> 1807.039
that's only their business none of yours

1803.919 --> 1809.039
none of it not your business

1807.039 --> 1810.96
because they're poisonous viper right

1809.039 --> 1813.919
now and you should not even

1810.96 --> 1814.799
allow yourself to be i just want him to

1813.919 --> 1818.7990000000002
be happy now

1814.799 --> 1821.9189999999999
[ __ ] that [ __ ] that

1818.799 --> 1822.799
no you let him go to hell it's up to

1821.919 --> 1825.8400000000001
them

1822.799 --> 1829.279
to come to you up to them

1825.84 --> 1832.08
to grow out of that darkness not you

1829.279 --> 1834.24
not you trying to pull them out of hell

1832.08 --> 1836.799
don't do that

1834.24 --> 1837.679
you lit when you do that you literally

1836.799 --> 1841.2
draw in

1837.679 --> 1845.3600000000001
aramanian energy in your system

1841.2 --> 1851.8400000000001
don't do it don't

1845.36 --> 1851.84
it's not good for you

1856.17 --> 1861.679
[Music]

1857.519 --> 1861.679
all right happy 1942

1861.84 --> 1866.32
okay right yeah

1868.559 --> 1870.8799999999999
right

1875.12 --> 1879.84
yeah heaven is for the good

1888.0 --> 1893.44
you know like what good is it just

1890.88 --> 1898.24
metaphorically you're in heaven

1893.44 --> 1900.0800000000002
you have like heaven pandemonium hell

1898.24 --> 1901.919
and there is interdiment there's no

1900.08 --> 1904.399
spatiality really there is just

1901.919 --> 1906.5590000000002
the spiritual dimension so you have

1904.399 --> 1909.36
awareness that there is hell there

1906.559 --> 1910.08
from a spiritual perspective so if there

1909.36 --> 1912.0
is just this

1910.08 --> 1913.12
poisonous turret there and you're like

1912.0 --> 1916.559
oh my god

1913.12 --> 1918.0
so sorry he is in hell let's take a

1916.559 --> 1921.039
spiritual

1918.0 --> 1923.76
uh called the fishing rod

1921.039 --> 1925.519
and pull that turd up straight out of

1923.76 --> 1929.6
hell

1925.519 --> 1931.76
put him up and then you're in heaven now

1929.6 --> 1933.84
yeah he's still a turd though what's it

1931.76 --> 1934.24
gonna do it's not even gonna see the

1933.84 --> 1936.32
light

1934.24 --> 1937.519
it's not even gonna feel it it's just

1936.32 --> 1940.799
gonna stink

1937.519 --> 1944.32
there see

1940.799 --> 1948.0
it's no use it has got to come

1944.32 --> 1963.75
from the inside in them if it does not

1948.0 --> 1966.839
don't waste your energy and focus

1963.75 --> 1966.839
[Music]

1970.0 --> 1975.679
all right if someone somebody is humble

1972.0 --> 1977.84
enough to actually ask for forgiveness

1975.679 --> 1979.2
if that's real and not just an act to

1977.84 --> 1981.36
try to fool you

1979.2 --> 1982.88
you can detect that if you're smart if

1981.36 --> 1984.24
you don't get distracted by your own

1982.88 --> 1987.1200000000001
enthusiasm feelings

1984.24 --> 1988.559
very important to do that but if

1987.12 --> 1990.7199999999998
somebody actually

1988.559 --> 1992.96
is seeking for forgiveness then they've

1990.72 --> 1993.519
already engaged in the transformation

1992.96 --> 1997.6000000000001
you will

1993.519 --> 2004.32
already feel that they are not demonic

1997.6 --> 2006.24
because only comes from the inside out

2004.32 --> 2007.76
and it changes the frequency changes

2006.24 --> 2011.1200000000001
they literally spiritually

2007.76 --> 2014.48
migrate their essence

2011.12 --> 2016.559
when that happens but you can't trick it

2014.48 --> 2018.24
you can't fool it it either happens or

2016.559 --> 2020.1589999999999
it does not happen it does not matter if

2018.24 --> 2022.3990000000001
somebody says it

2020.159 --> 2033.8400000000001
if they did it you will know you will

2022.399 --> 2033.84
feel it you will see it

2037.73 --> 2043.16
[Music]

2064.72 --> 2068.48
right anyway enough about

2068.72 --> 2076.0789999999997
trolls in hell

2074.24 --> 2078.24
but yeah it's good to address it for a

2076.079 --> 2078.48
second hey if a troll is going to come

2078.24 --> 2080.4799999999996
in

2078.48 --> 2082.639
you know i've shared this many times

2080.48 --> 2085.44
before yeah trolls

2082.639 --> 2085.9190000000003
you're going to have a very very tough

2085.44 --> 2088.96
time

2085.919 --> 2092.0789999999997
trying to ruin my show because

2088.96 --> 2094.639
i will always find some kind of way

2092.079 --> 2095.28
to actually get more positivity or

2094.639 --> 2098.32
lessons

2095.28 --> 2099.3590000000004
out of your presence then you are going

2098.32 --> 2104.4
to ruin

2099.359 --> 2107.2799999999997
the mood so yeah i'm not afraid

2104.4 --> 2108.4
you can't take anything from me you can

2107.28 --> 2111.28
only give

2108.4 --> 2112.96
me things even though you didn't see

2111.28 --> 2117.8390000000004
that is what you were doing

2112.96 --> 2117.839
so yeah it's up to you

2129.76 --> 2136.4
the age of grace will end at some point

2133.359 --> 2136.4
what are you talking about

2140.8 --> 2145.28
you mean the tolerance of the

2143.92 --> 2149.76
intolerable

2145.28 --> 2154.8
the culture that's not grace that's just

2149.76 --> 2154.8
like slavish tolerance that's not grace

2156.72 --> 2161.52
grace is actually acting on the truth

2166.88 --> 2173.52
like grace also comes with

2170.079 --> 2174.88
mercy that's you know because of real

2173.52 --> 2177.04
mercy

2174.88 --> 2179.04
you know you can't just let somebody go

2177.04 --> 2181.599
that's a criminal you know

2179.04 --> 2183.2799999999997
that's obviously done things terrible

2181.599 --> 2183.599
and then you could say yeah so graceful

2183.28 --> 2186.48
that

2183.599 --> 2188.6400000000003
oh we gave him another chance but is

2186.48 --> 2189.44
there any promise that he's going to

2188.64 --> 2191.359
change

2189.44 --> 2194.079
or is he just going to do the same thing

2191.359 --> 2197.44
well that's not grace then is it

2194.079 --> 2200.48
you know real forgiveness

2197.44 --> 2202.7200000000003
should only follow

2200.48 --> 2205.119
after the inner transformation the

2202.72 --> 2206.0
realization the confrontation of the

2205.119 --> 2209.52
individual

2206.0 --> 2212.56
and their misdeeds and their sins

2209.52 --> 2214.32
that they know it not speaking they

2212.56 --> 2215.68
know it and then the transformation

2214.32 --> 2218.56
happens

2215.68 --> 2220.0
and then yeah then you might forgive

2218.56 --> 2223.119
somebody because they have

2220.0 --> 2226.079
actually changed and they don't want to

2223.119 --> 2229.599
be like that anymore and they really do

2226.079 --> 2233.8390000000004
their best not to be that and they can

2229.599 --> 2236.7200000000003
they can grow out of it

2233.839 --> 2237.839
and that's the time to forgive but not

2236.72 --> 2239.7599999999998
before

2237.839 --> 2243.839
forgiving somebody and just letting them

2239.76 --> 2243.8390000000004
go or something it doesn't do anything

2244.8 --> 2261.28
does it's not graceful in my opinion

2256.96 --> 2264.32
i don't know but i guess you could

2261.28 --> 2266.0
interpret it slightly differently yeah

2264.32 --> 2268.7200000000003
maybe it's a language barrier thing you

2266.0 --> 2269.599
know it's difficult the word grace for

2268.72 --> 2272.3199999999997
me is

2269.599 --> 2272.32
it's difficult

2279.119 --> 2287.6800000000003
i guess yeah because grace

2284.48 --> 2292.2400000000002
is like grazia

2287.68 --> 2292.24
thank or uh

2293.2 --> 2301.2799999999997
like forgiveness but

2296.48 --> 2303.28
like only a true ruler

2301.28 --> 2306.7200000000003
can do that technically where the word

2303.28 --> 2309.2000000000003
comes from right like a king

2306.72 --> 2310.16
can just say okay yeah you were a

2309.2 --> 2313.359
complete dick

2310.16 --> 2315.7599999999998
to me and blabbered about me

2313.359 --> 2319.5989999999997
but because you had such a bad time i'm

2315.76 --> 2319.599
gonna forgive you now that's grace

2320.079 --> 2324.5600000000004
kind of a way because that has to do

2322.8 --> 2325.6800000000003
with sovereignty and sovereign ruling

2324.56 --> 2327.7599999999998
and

2325.68 --> 2329.5989999999997
but yeah if you're not a ruler over

2327.76 --> 2333.119
anyone then how is it

2329.599 --> 2334.96
even possible no

2333.119 --> 2336.48
unless you're just gonna say no the

2334.96 --> 2340.2400000000002
grace of god

2336.48 --> 2343.32
basically the natural

2340.24 --> 2344.56
natural forgiveness non-centralized

2343.32 --> 2347.76
non-personified

2344.56 --> 2349.7599999999998
of the creation in response

2347.76 --> 2351.76
now that could be considered grace but

2349.76 --> 2354.96
that's very different see so

2351.76 --> 2356.88
the word grace is difficult for me it's

2354.96 --> 2360.2400000000002
a very complex issue

2356.88 --> 2360.2400000000002
like what is real grace

2361.44 --> 2364.64
you know christians love to use that

2364.24 --> 2367.5989999999997
word

2364.64 --> 2368.0
so glorious but what does it really mean

2367.599 --> 2371.04
like

2368.0 --> 2371.04
really really mean

2377.119 --> 2383.839
grace under pressure what do you mean

2385.599 --> 2397.839
once the tribulation starts

2388.96 --> 2397.839
what tribulation

2400.24 --> 2404.8799999999997
was there ever a time when there wasn't

2402.0 --> 2404.88
a tribulation

2405.52 --> 2411.92
as far as i'm aware of the tribulation

2409.119 --> 2414.319
has been happening before i was even

2411.92 --> 2414.319
born

2415.359 --> 2418.96
i'm wondering if there was ever a time

2417.2 --> 2420.64
when there isn't a tribulation

2418.96 --> 2422.8
because this [ __ ] has been going on

2420.64 --> 2424.96
forever since the beginning of history

2422.8 --> 2429.44
as far as i can tell

2424.96 --> 2429.44
it's always there always the same stuff

2429.52 --> 2432.8
always the pressure always the

2431.04 --> 2439.839
seductions always the

2432.8 --> 2439.8390000000004
the dark ones somehow in control

2440.88 --> 2447.04
simple elegance are refinement of

2444.16 --> 2447.839
movement interesting a man like me

2447.04 --> 2451.68
that's

2447.839 --> 2452.24
see again it just goes to show it's not

2451.68 --> 2454.319
so

2452.24 --> 2457.1189999999997
easy straightforward as you might think

2454.319 --> 2457.119
the word grace

2457.2 --> 2465.04
because that that form that

2460.24 --> 2468.3999999999996
word of grace means graceful so elegance

2465.04 --> 2471.7599999999998
uh effective like in a way that

2468.4 --> 2473.6800000000003
is aesthetically pleasing or inspiring

2471.76 --> 2481.8390000000004
because it's like exemplary

2473.68 --> 2481.839
see that's another form of grace

2507.52 --> 2510.64
hmm okay man like me yeah that makes

2510.079 --> 2512.319
sense

2510.64 --> 2513.92
it's funny you know when you look at the

2512.319 --> 2515.44
word like that and then

2513.92 --> 2517.839
consider these things that are said

2515.44 --> 2520.7200000000003
about it yeah it's basically

2517.839 --> 2522.56
logos if you do the right thing if you

2520.72 --> 2524.0789999999997
follow the path if you follow the right

2522.56 --> 2527.92
instructions

2524.079 --> 2529.6800000000003
and you basically apply the most

2527.92 --> 2533.119
effective

2529.68 --> 2536.72
strategies in your life that are

2533.119 --> 2539.839
accountable for in the design logos

2536.72 --> 2542.16
then you've gained grace

2539.839 --> 2543.2799999999997
and you could perceive that as a

2542.16 --> 2546.48
bestowal of

2543.28 --> 2548.48
blessings from a personified god

2546.48 --> 2550.56
or you could see it as like yeah that's

2548.48 --> 2552.4
exactly how you're supposed to do it and

2550.56 --> 2555.44
then it's just going to be great

2552.4 --> 2558.88
because that is how things work see

2555.44 --> 2563.04
that's a matter of perspective

2558.88 --> 2565.28
i am much more focused on the design

2563.04 --> 2566.88
add it then the designer with those

2565.28 --> 2568.96
things because i think that they are

2566.88 --> 2572.4
basically

2568.96 --> 2572.4
yeah two parts

2572.64 --> 2577.04
on the on a singular string they're like

2575.04 --> 2580.96
two ends of the same string

2577.04 --> 2580.96
to me you know

2581.04 --> 2585.7599999999998
almost like magnetics and electrics

2583.839 --> 2589.119
dielectrics

2585.76 --> 2591.599
i see that like the will

2589.119 --> 2593.2000000000003
of god and the design and how it

2591.599 --> 2594.88
functions it's kind of the same

2593.2 --> 2597.68
to me you know i don't see the

2594.88 --> 2601.6800000000003
separation i don't see it

2597.68 --> 2604.96
it's like yeah that's why i tend to save

2601.68 --> 2606.0789999999997
and believe philosophically at least

2604.96 --> 2610.48
that

2606.079 --> 2613.52
god the creator is all things

2610.48 --> 2617.52
alpha and omega and because yeah

2613.52 --> 2619.44
who when god acts i don't see him

2617.52 --> 2621.359
as a man or whatever coming out of the

2619.44 --> 2625.119
clouds or no

2621.359 --> 2630.48
the creation does it it happens

2625.119 --> 2630.48
so see but it's philosophical at it so

2632.72 --> 2636.7999999999997
man i seem to be very energetic today

2637.359 --> 2645.2799999999997
i i told you i told you that i did

2640.88 --> 2649.839
felt great very very strong this morning

2645.28 --> 2649.8390000000004
i guess it shows

2662.8 --> 2669.6800000000003
how do christians miss all the pagan

2665.92 --> 2673.359
what does that mean in that

2669.68 --> 2674.48
in all religions you know what does that

2673.359 --> 2679.2
even mean i think that

2674.48 --> 2682.64
christian and pagan is just an exoteric

2679.2 --> 2684.8799999999997
division that in the core

2682.64 --> 2687.359
basically comes down to do you have a

2684.88 --> 2690.4
centralized all-powerful creator

2687.359 --> 2690.72
or are you going to deny that i don't

2690.4 --> 2692.7200000000003
know

2690.72 --> 2694.64
virtually kill him or something and then

2692.72 --> 2698.7999999999997
separate it into

2694.64 --> 2700.48
other deities or no deities at all and

2698.8 --> 2702.6400000000003
you're the deity

2700.48 --> 2704.2400000000002
in the infant deity or you know as

2702.64 --> 2706.4
luciferians like to think

2704.24 --> 2707.359
you know that is that's really what it's

2706.4 --> 2710.64
about if

2707.359 --> 2714.64
pagan is

2710.64 --> 2718.48
such crappy overhauled politicized words

2714.64 --> 2721.5989999999997
it's unbelievable

2718.48 --> 2724.8
you know pagan just meets somebody that

2721.599 --> 2727.2000000000003
lives in the bushes basically that's it

2724.8 --> 2728.6400000000003
non-city folk people that like to keep

2727.2 --> 2730.56
away from the center

2728.64 --> 2731.7599999999998
centralized government and keep things

2730.56 --> 2733.359
to their own

2731.76 --> 2735.0400000000004
stay in the bushes don't like to follow

2733.359 --> 2737.119
rules

2735.04 --> 2738.16
that's what it is now does that mean

2737.119 --> 2742.48
that those people

2738.16 --> 2745.44
are benevolent religious

2742.48 --> 2749.119
priests of nature and that they're all

2745.44 --> 2752.56
good and they never do any harm ever

2749.119 --> 2753.92
no that doesn't mean that at all pagans

2752.56 --> 2756.0
could just as well be

2753.92 --> 2757.839
just crazy freaking witches that are

2756.0 --> 2760.079
completely anti-social

2757.839 --> 2761.599
and live in the bushes because of that

2760.079 --> 2765.599
see it's

2761.599 --> 2769.92
it doesn't mean anything it doesn't mean

2765.599 --> 2769.92
anything anymore complete waste

2770.0 --> 2775.52
ah thank you julio pepman for the 20

2773.359 --> 2776.72
super chat donation here's some money

2775.52 --> 2780.64
for a conspiracy

2776.72 --> 2784.72
fund ah

2780.64 --> 2787.7599999999998
that's that's nice well i prefer

2784.72 --> 2791.359
paypal but you know that

2787.76 --> 2791.3590000000004
don't know if that's also part of it

2791.44 --> 2797.76
but yeah because it does get

2795.119 --> 2799.28
with yeah withdrawn by the government

2797.76 --> 2801.6800000000003
out of my paycheck

2799.28 --> 2804.2400000000002
in the end but yeah thank you for the

2801.68 --> 2804.24
gesture

2804.319 --> 2808.0
i didn't know there was a conspiracy

2814.839 --> 2819.119
fund

2816.48 --> 2821.119
and now that you mention it a conspiracy

2819.119 --> 2824.1600000000003
fund seems like a bad idea

2821.119 --> 2824.6400000000003
to call it that because conspiring tends

2824.16 --> 2828.839
to be

2824.64 --> 2831.839
illegal and to just call it a conspiracy

2828.839 --> 2831.839
fund

2835.359 --> 2844.319
anyway it doesn't matter thank you for

2837.839 --> 2849.119
the super chat donation

2844.319 --> 2849.119
oh time has flown got 10 more minutes

2857.2 --> 2864.48
yeah yeah and by the way julio pabin has

2861.76 --> 2866.88
pretty much been single-handedly

2864.48 --> 2869.52
paypal funding me in the last week i

2866.88 --> 2869.52
don't know why

2869.839 --> 2875.7599999999998
but yeah he's been the only one that has

2873.599 --> 2877.52
actually paypal donated to me so thank

2875.76 --> 2878.88
you very much you you've have you pretty

2877.52 --> 2881.68
much been

2878.88 --> 2881.6800000000003
holding me up

2885.2 --> 2887.839
so thank you

2897.68 --> 2901.2799999999997
it's a joke based on yesterday's

2899.2 --> 2903.68
conversation

2901.28 --> 2906.0
what was yesterday's conversation you

2903.68 --> 2908.48
mean it on my show or flat earth debates

2906.0 --> 2915.839
i don't remember

2908.48 --> 2915.839
but it's okay

2920.8 --> 2923.52
hello by the way

2923.839 --> 2943.839
i don't know what a a pananthist is

2928.88 --> 2943.839
do you mean a pantheist

2949.28 --> 2953.0400000000004
right yeah as for what i personally

2952.079 --> 2955.119
believe

2953.04 --> 2957.2799999999997
i think i can feel that in the last few

2955.119 --> 2961.119
minutes

2957.28 --> 2962.2400000000002
ah right julian what am i i absolutely

2961.119 --> 2965.94
believe in a

2962.24 --> 2968.839
central original designer

2965.94 --> 2971.52
[Music]

2968.839 --> 2974.4
and i think that

2971.52 --> 2974.88
he's been it i'm going to make it a he

2974.4 --> 2977.599
because

2974.88 --> 2978.559
i'm he and that's how i my mind has been

2977.599 --> 2982.319
set

2978.559 --> 2984.1600000000003
it the almighty i think he's done a lot

2982.319 --> 2985.68
it's already been described as a lot but

2984.16 --> 2989.359
i think that

2985.68 --> 2990.64
people also have politicized situations

2989.359 --> 2993.92
because i think that

2990.64 --> 2996.0
he originally created the pantheon

2993.92 --> 2997.6800000000003
you know the sons of god the single

2996.0 --> 3001.04
sentence in the bible

2997.68 --> 3004.7999999999997
so what what sons of god what

3001.04 --> 3008.48
what hmm right so yeah i think that

3004.8 --> 3010.96
the original creator did make a pantheon

3008.48 --> 3011.599
and then it turned out to be not that

3010.96 --> 3017.44
great

3011.599 --> 3020.8
to him so they had their time

3017.44 --> 3022.0
and then they went away again but since

3020.8 --> 3025.119
they were apparently

3022.0 --> 3028.0
very yeah or immortal in some

3025.119 --> 3029.92
spiritual way he had to actually lock

3028.0 --> 3031.92
them up because they kept asserting

3029.92 --> 3035.599
their

3031.92 --> 3038.88
temporal ego based will

3035.599 --> 3042.4
over the will of creation itself

3038.88 --> 3042.4
see that's another way to see it

3042.72 --> 3051.1189999999997
so yeah the fallen angels or the gods

3047.68 --> 3053.68
the gods the the yeah the big ones the

3051.119 --> 3055.839
zeus and all that

3053.68 --> 3057.2
and the half gods and all that that came

3055.839 --> 3059.2
from it

3057.2 --> 3061.359
i'm not i don't think that they don't

3059.2 --> 3063.2799999999997
exist or never have existed i think that

3061.359 --> 3064.4
they probably did exist and i think that

3063.28 --> 3068.88
they were probably

3064.4 --> 3071.44
part of the creators early

3068.88 --> 3071.44
creation

3072.8 --> 3078.4
and they're no longer like yeah

3076.64 --> 3080.7999999999997
their time has run out even though they

3078.4 --> 3081.599
are probably technically immortal in

3080.8 --> 3084.8
spirit

3081.599 --> 3087.52
whatever that means like

3084.8 --> 3088.1600000000003
their spirit cannot be laid to rest and

3087.52 --> 3090.24
it will

3088.16 --> 3092.0789999999997
keep on gripping back or something you

3090.24 --> 3094.0789999999997
know it's something like that

3092.079 --> 3095.8390000000004
because yeah according to christianity

3094.079 --> 3097.6800000000003
of course everybody's spirit is

3095.839 --> 3099.359
technically immortal

3097.68 --> 3101.359
but it doesn't mean that after you're

3099.359 --> 3104.5589999999997
dead you can just hop around

3101.359 --> 3107.359
and do all kinds of stuff you know

3104.559 --> 3109.44
and suddenly like reanimate and i say

3107.359 --> 3110.64
yeah it's actually me yeah i know i'm

3109.44 --> 3114.2400000000002
dead but i'm back

3110.64 --> 3114.24
no that that doesn't happen

3114.72 --> 3120.0
but maybe with the gods or the fallen

3118.16 --> 3123.5989999999997
angels the sons of god

3120.0 --> 3126.64
maybe it did happen with them

3123.599 --> 3128.2400000000002
like that and and because of it the

3126.64 --> 3130.319
creator basically

3128.24 --> 3133.1189999999997
yeah pulled some strings and locked them

3130.319 --> 3133.119
into the vaults

3137.52 --> 3143.2
see so yeah again all his opinions oh we

3141.68 --> 3143.5989999999997
have to say it like this we have to do

3143.2 --> 3145.52
it

3143.599 --> 3147.44
we have to do it like this oh and it's

3145.52 --> 3150.48
all the others are wrong let's

3147.44 --> 3152.079
war let's war let's kill the ones that

3150.48 --> 3154.8
don't have our specific

3152.079 --> 3155.6800000000003
political angle to the entire reality

3154.8 --> 3159.52
right

3155.68 --> 3163.2
yeah it's just freaking great

3159.52 --> 3166.319
i'd like to instead just get the truth

3163.2 --> 3171.2799999999997
from all of it and then still remain

3166.319 --> 3171.2799999999997
sensible and still follow the path

3171.359 --> 3178.319
see that's why i just abandoned

3175.04 --> 3180.88
exoterics i abandon it

3178.319 --> 3183.2
it's like when people say to me oh but

3180.88 --> 3185.52
there's been no historical evidence that

3183.2 --> 3186.3999999999996
jesus christ wasn't real and then i'm

3185.52 --> 3190.079
saying like

3186.4 --> 3192.48
i don't give a [ __ ] i don't give a [ __ ]

3190.079 --> 3193.2000000000003
if the entire story was just from

3192.48 --> 3196.2400000000002
scratch

3193.2 --> 3199.839
fabricated every single bit of it

3196.24 --> 3200.3999999999996
because the story is real the energy is

3199.839 --> 3203.119
real

3200.4 --> 3204.0
the example is real i don't care where

3203.119 --> 3206.079
it came from

3204.0 --> 3207.76
i don't care if it was like that or if

3206.079 --> 3209.6800000000003
it was a fictional character

3207.76 --> 3212.1600000000003
and they grafted it together from

3209.68 --> 3215.2
thousands of glorious moments

3212.16 --> 3218.5589999999997
and then designed that

3215.2 --> 3222.0
for us i don't care

3218.559 --> 3224.8
i'm a christian and i'm gonna do it

3222.0 --> 3227.359
like this and i don't give a [ __ ] if

3224.8 --> 3232.079
that means that the entire world

3227.359 --> 3232.0789999999997
will go to war with me i don't care

3234.8 --> 3239.76
ah paypal is working you say julie of

3237.52 --> 3251.44
heaven

3239.76 --> 3255.76
that's good to hear

3251.44 --> 3260.8
paypal is working indeed holy [ __ ]

3255.76 --> 3260.8
thank you so much whoo

3262.839 --> 3270.16
that's very very helpful

3266.079 --> 3272.559
thank you so much julio pabin

3270.16 --> 3275.2
yeah you've single-handedly maintained

3272.559 --> 3279.8390000000004
me this entire month this glorious thank

3275.2 --> 3279.839
you so much

3286.24 --> 3293.2799999999997
i always have to let those moments sink

3288.319 --> 3295.2799999999997
in for me jesus is the son

3293.28 --> 3296.3190000000004
look you can make jesus into whatever

3295.28 --> 3299.44
you like

3296.319 --> 3302.0
you can draw him away you know it's the

3299.44 --> 3306.079
same thing with the bible it's like oh

3302.0 --> 3310.24
but jesus is actually the son but jesus

3306.079 --> 3313.119
is that person or that person

3310.24 --> 3314.72
is like okay does that matter or are you

3313.119 --> 3318.1600000000003
stating

3314.72 --> 3320.64
that he is exclusively that and

3318.16 --> 3322.96
not the other things is that what you're

3320.64 --> 3324.64
doing well if you're doing that

3322.96 --> 3326.64
then you're doing what gnostics are

3324.64 --> 3328.72
doing and you're doing what luciferians

3326.64 --> 3331.5989999999997
are doing you're literally

3328.72 --> 3333.2799999999997
denying it you're cutting things out

3331.599 --> 3336.48
saying no

3333.28 --> 3340.2400000000002
that's not real i'm going to ignore that

3336.48 --> 3343.359
even though it is essentially very good

3340.24 --> 3347.1189999999997
and effective and part of the path yeah

3343.359 --> 3349.2799999999997
that's what gnostics do and luciferians

3347.119 --> 3350.96
if not just outright rejecting the whole

3349.28 --> 3354.0
