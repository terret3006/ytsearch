116.96 --> 121.03999999999999
yeah the weather today is

121.119 --> 124.079
kind of grayish

126.0 --> 129.92
it like yesterday although it's yeah

128.239 --> 133.03900000000002
it's not as hazy

129.92 --> 133.039
as it was yesterday

134.8 --> 139.76000000000002
and it is at least dry

137.84 --> 143.36
it's very cold though i kind of closed

139.76 --> 145.76
the window for a bit

143.36 --> 148.16000000000003
i'll open it up because i do need my

145.76 --> 151.44
fresh air

148.16 --> 154.879
but yeah that's what

151.44 --> 154.879
the weather is like over here

155.599 --> 160.319
hello powell broda

158.03 --> 164.08
[Music]

160.319 --> 167.04
so i got green tea with me and

164.08 --> 171.12
a bun i should not wait too long or get

167.04 --> 173.28
cold and hard

171.12 --> 175.68
had the other one before this show

173.28 --> 175.68
started

178.4 --> 185.59900000000002
ah here we go again you watched that

181.84 --> 188.0
yeah it was wasn't it

185.599 --> 190.48
and indeed it was a bit strange and

188.0 --> 190.48
creepy

191.68 --> 199.84
but it was still very worthwhile

193.76 --> 199.84
watching i thought

203.18 --> 206.34900000000002
[Music]

208.239 --> 211.28
so yesterday

211.44 --> 216.319
it's a pretty interesting day

218.159 --> 224.39999999999998
after my own show which i thought was

220.799 --> 224.4
pretty good didn't watch it back though

224.799 --> 228.959
barely find that time for that these

226.48 --> 232.0
days that was over benjamin live and

228.959 --> 234.879
that was pretty cool

232.0 --> 234.879
it's about again

239.439 --> 244.48
yeah about a lot of things bacteria of

242.56 --> 248.0
course and

244.48 --> 251.92
just the other typical media

248.0 --> 254.239
front guys front guys whatever

251.92 --> 255.67999999999998
and yeah where how they are slipping

254.239 --> 258.479
down

255.68 --> 260.32
morally and just he described that

258.479 --> 262.639
elaborately

260.32 --> 264.639
and yeah it's too good to keep that in

262.639 --> 265.919
mind and very funny at times when you

264.639 --> 270.08
realize where

265.919 --> 273.28
those figures are probably going

270.08 --> 274.88
uh yeah and then i

273.28 --> 276.479
had to cut it off because it was paul

274.88 --> 280.84
buster's life and

276.479 --> 283.36
yeah was there anniversary of the black

280.84 --> 287.52
swan

283.36 --> 287.52000000000004
it was an interesting show i thought

290.96 --> 302.23999999999995
after that

296.08 --> 302.24
i just kind of watched babylon 5 a bit

302.32 --> 304.8
that's it

305.44 --> 311.84
so yeah how are you doing

314.479 --> 322.0
the title is a bit of a fake out

317.919 --> 322.0
but yeah i hope that is obvious

323.52 --> 328.639
but yeah hey if you want me to explain

325.68 --> 332.479
about that i probably could

328.639 --> 332.479
it's going to be spin doctor e

332.58 --> 335.769
[Music]

339.41 --> 342.459
[Music]

346.32 --> 351.36
yeah and also been keeping

349.759 --> 353.68
like i've been keeping track more

351.36 --> 357.28000000000003
recently

353.68 --> 361.039
of some troll activity and chats and

357.28 --> 361.039
just see like what are they doing

361.68 --> 367.199
like how do they work

365.28 --> 369.039
because yeah there's some ballers that

367.199 --> 371.199
just hang around in chat and do their

369.039 --> 372.88
ball thing

371.199 --> 374.72
and then yeah they always have been

372.88 --> 377.44
doing but there's also just

374.72 --> 377.44000000000005
figures that

378.479 --> 386.479
oh yeah more like professional

383.039 --> 388.0
level trolling like they had they

386.479 --> 391.039
scatter gun with a lot of

388.0 --> 393.6
things that they seem to have at the

391.039 --> 396.4
ready yet to go for copy pasting a lot

393.6 --> 396.88
that sort of thing and they just keep on

396.4 --> 399.12
going

396.88 --> 400.319
like very intensely like maybe they

399.12 --> 403.36
really believe that

400.319 --> 405.759
if they do that enough

403.36 --> 408.88
that it'll just discourage flat earthers

405.759 --> 412.24
or something

408.88 --> 415.44
or it is there to just drive

412.24 --> 418.08
yeah the flare there's insane and get

415.44 --> 420.4
them all agitated

418.08 --> 422.56
maybe that is the purpose it yeah they

420.4 --> 425.75899999999996
do agitate me

422.56 --> 427.039
a little sometimes it's just it's

425.759 --> 431.039
annoying when you have

427.039 --> 431.039
answers and they're just not listening

435.68 --> 438.96
have you here

443.039 --> 451.84
tightening tightening conspiracy

448.84 --> 451.84
what

476.84 --> 479.84
tightening

480.96 --> 486.0
yeah here we go again there's a lot of

483.12 --> 493.84000000000003
misspelling going on there in what pow

486.0 --> 493.84
powell broda said i think

498.24 --> 510.40000000000003
yeah but if you can be more specific

507.28 --> 513.12
oh and type yeah yeah yeah anti facts

510.4 --> 515.1999999999999
are like the next

513.12 --> 517.279
level conspiracy theorists and they're

515.2 --> 520.32
really coming after it now they've

517.279 --> 523.36
always have been

520.32 --> 526.399
it's just that now it's been pushed more

523.36 --> 531.279
up to the front and maybe

526.399 --> 531.279
all this vaccine talk is kind of doing

532.839 --> 535.839
that

539.2 --> 548.88
what social pariah is now

542.32 --> 552.88
no not really

548.88 --> 556.24
oh stone monkey 3d really you have

552.88 --> 556.24
okay that's interesting

560.839 --> 563.839
really

567.6 --> 574.24
do you have a video of that like a link

571.2 --> 575.2
stonemonkey3d i'll give you a wrench for

574.24 --> 591.839
that

575.2 --> 591.839
so you can post it

595.12 --> 599.12
post title okay that's fine too

599.6 --> 605.839
i hate what was all

615.519 --> 620.079
uh okay powell broda

621.76 --> 628.0
you mean conspiracy talk

625.44 --> 630.6400000000001
conspiracy theorizing because as far as

628.0 --> 634.48
i know conspiracy

630.64 --> 637.519
is actually sort of criminal

634.48 --> 640.16
so like yeah what you said can

637.519 --> 641.36
mean to counter opposite things at this

640.16 --> 644.399
point so can you be

641.36 --> 644.399
more specific

645.6 --> 652.48
like conspiracy yeah that can be

649.72 --> 653.44
anti-conspiracy or and conspiracy

652.48 --> 657.6800000000001
theorists

653.44 --> 661.0400000000001
or literally the conspiring so

657.68 --> 663.3599999999999
which is the what yeah so

661.04 --> 666.8
please be more specific hey nathan

663.36 --> 666.8000000000001
oakley 980 good to see you

669.68 --> 678.4799999999999
3d zero gyroscope

672.959 --> 678.4799999999999
okay that's the title of that video

680.83 --> 685.2
[Music]

682.48 --> 686.0790000000001
at least that's not going to be a white

685.2 --> 702.8000000000001
hit

686.079 --> 705.3599999999999
with the search i think

702.8 --> 705.3599999999999
okay

707.44 --> 711.7600000000001
that's a very short clip

714.839 --> 717.839
and

718.0 --> 723.36
45 yeah so how is this

721.6 --> 725.9200000000001
proof that they're helium balloons

723.36 --> 725.92
exactly

726.24 --> 731.76
because these could literally just be

729.2 --> 735.6
yeah balloons

731.76 --> 735.6
they don't seem like helium balloons at

742.839 --> 745.839
all

747.36 --> 753.12
because yeah we don't get to see them in

750.32 --> 753.12
this oh wait

754.32 --> 756.5600000000001
hey

757.44 --> 760.48
oh that's interesting

760.8 --> 768.0
yeah they do actually return to normal

764.32 --> 770.1600000000001
and they yeah the balloons do go up that

768.0 --> 770.16
is

770.639 --> 773.839
that is unexpected

781.92 --> 787.04
i'll have to show that over at the flat

785.6 --> 790.24
earth debates wow that's

787.04 --> 790.24
totally unexpected

798.839 --> 801.839
huh

803.12 --> 806.88
yeah i'm gonna have to rethink about

804.72 --> 814.9590000000001
that because i did bring that up

806.88 --> 817.76
like a while back

814.959 --> 821.199
whoa is that the real fight to fly what

817.76 --> 821.199
are you doing in my chat

825.519 --> 829.839
ah thank you bible

830.8 --> 842.42
for the five pound super chat donation

833.6 --> 845.5400000000001
shout out to nathan

842.42 --> 845.54
[Music]

847.519 --> 852.88
right yeah they

851.12 --> 855.199
and the balloons they didn't shoot to

852.88 --> 858.639
the back so

855.199 --> 858.639
that's what i thought would happen

860.48 --> 885.839
so i guess i was wrong

871.36 --> 885.839
from the same time what

890.48 --> 899.839
whoa well that video is nine years old

903.12 --> 909.12
this channel overall is not very active

906.56 --> 909.8389999999999
so one video three years ago and the

909.12 --> 914.72
rest is all

909.839 --> 914.72
seven years ago and nine

914.88 --> 918.639
anyway yeah uh thank you for finding

918.16 --> 922.48
that

918.639 --> 922.48
that at least answers that question

923.279 --> 927.8389999999999
i have to take that into consideration

966.839 --> 972.72
hmm

969.6 --> 977.44
oh you're premiering the edited top

972.72 --> 981.0400000000001

[Music]

1203.52 --> 1210.8799999999999
yeah slicks james johnson

1207.679 --> 1214.24
he's a guy that really does not

1210.88 --> 1215.3600000000001
like beliefs that's what i remember

1214.24 --> 1217.76
mostly about him

1215.36 --> 1220.24
who was uh on the flat earth debates for

1217.76 --> 1222.8799999999999
a period

1220.24 --> 1224.32
uh that's yeah i we haven't heard from

1222.88 --> 1229.1200000000001
him in a while

1224.32 --> 1229.12
he was very active in 2019 i think

1230.799 --> 1235.12
and then he kind of dropped off but he

1232.64 --> 1238.3200000000002
that that guy does have like

1235.12 --> 1238.32
certain issues

1240.72 --> 1243.679
it's like very

1244.24 --> 1253.2
yeah dubious uh social uh behavior

1249.36 --> 1253.1999999999998
in real life let's just say it like that

1254.08 --> 1257.6789999999999
but yeah he did he did participate and

1257.36 --> 1260.1589999999999
like

1257.679 --> 1261.1200000000001
really put out his personal kind of

1260.159 --> 1263.6000000000001
simplistic

1261.12 --> 1265.28
philosophy and it was interesting to

1263.6 --> 1276.08
listen to

1265.28 --> 1279.44
but yeah also it got a bit silly

1276.08 --> 1282.08
can i explain to what why do you want me

1279.44 --> 1282.0800000000002
to do that

1284.24 --> 1290.72
do you know anybody with napoleon

1286.4 --> 1295.6000000000001
complex tony sterner

1290.72 --> 1295.6000000000001
i've never met anybody that actually had

1302.84 --> 1305.84
that

1316.88 --> 1319.8400000000001
uh

1319.92 --> 1323.559
[Music]

1328.54 --> 1334.089
[Music]

1340.159 --> 1347.1200000000001
napoleon complex it's been a long time

1343.44 --> 1349.44
after freshen up

1347.12 --> 1350.6399999999999
i do know that napoleon was a very

1349.44 --> 1352.96
little guy

1350.64 --> 1354.24
and was always overcompensating for that

1352.96 --> 1356.4
and i think

1354.24 --> 1357.52
napoleon complex has to do something

1356.4 --> 1360.3200000000002
with that

1357.52 --> 1362.6399999999999
but it could also be more emphasis on

1360.32 --> 1364.799
psychology

1362.64 --> 1366.64
of actually believing you are that

1364.799 --> 1368.48
historical figure and that can also

1366.64 --> 1371.5200000000002
happen with other types of

1368.48 --> 1373.76
figures that

1371.52 --> 1375.52
you basically start to act out a

1373.76 --> 1388.72
character

1375.52 --> 1391.9189999999999
and stick to that look it up

1388.72 --> 1395.6000000000001
yeah all right so it was the first one

1391.919 --> 1403.8400000000001
inferiority complex because of a short

1395.6 --> 1403.84
nature yeah yeah

1409.83 --> 1412.97
[Music]

1429.2 --> 1433.52
so yeah that's it

1434.159 --> 1445.8400000000001
why did you want me to bring that up

1464.23 --> 1473.84
[Music]

1466.64 --> 1473.8400000000001
i'll just eat the bun

1476.03 --> 1479.16
[Music]

1484.84 --> 1487.84
hmm

1498.84 --> 1501.84
so

1508.48 --> 1515.84
yeah zack sterling you got that right

1526.48 --> 1529.6
i don't know if the guy is even doing

1528.0 --> 1532.799
shows anymore

1529.6 --> 1533.6
does anybody know or is there anybody

1532.799 --> 1537.44
still left

1533.6 --> 1537.84
to care about that because he had been

1537.44 --> 1541.039
very

1537.84 --> 1543.84
active doing his devil persecution

1541.039 --> 1543.84
vanier hangout

1544.32 --> 1557.84
i don't know if that's still going i

1546.08 --> 1557.84
have no idea

1564.0 --> 1571.84
[Music]

1565.44 --> 1571.8400000000001
yeah i know here we go again

1578.159 --> 1582.64
oh yeah iron 26 that i don't know him

1582.0 --> 1585.12
too well

1582.64 --> 1588.0
i just know he's a guy with a very bad

1585.12 --> 1592.7199999999998
attitude overall

1588.0 --> 1595.2
who thinks he's all on the side of god

1592.72 --> 1598.799
in some way yet his behavior shows

1595.2 --> 1601.279
anything but

1598.799 --> 1601.9189999999999
making a lot of mistakes if he really is

1601.279 --> 1604.799
that

1601.919 --> 1605.3600000000001
according to himself and yet i don't

1604.799 --> 1607.84
know

1605.36 --> 1609.76
he's just spent a lot of time building

1607.84 --> 1613.12
up like a conspiracy about

1609.76 --> 1616.559
how everybody's evil and several

1613.12 --> 1619.6
flat earthers going after bob nodell now

1616.559 --> 1622.3999999999999
of course there's some reason to that

1619.6 --> 1623.9189999999999
that it yeah there's issues that i

1622.4 --> 1627.52
addressed at the time as well and i

1623.919 --> 1630.24
guess that's how it sort of connected up

1627.52 --> 1631.2
but he's also going after nathan oakley

1630.24 --> 1634.32
for what it's

1631.2 --> 1635.679
totally totally idiotic there's nothing

1634.32 --> 1639.4399999999998
there

1635.679 --> 1641.76
and i don't know after me

1639.44 --> 1643.3600000000001
i never i wasn't never really sure i

1641.76 --> 1645.52
think they were like

1643.36 --> 1648.799
he was trying to come after me but

1645.52 --> 1648.799
there's nothing really here

1649.44 --> 1654.3990000000001
to come after it's just me

1652.64 --> 1656.72
getting really passionate or really

1654.399 --> 1669.84
pissed off about something sometimes

1656.72 --> 1669.84
and that's it

1671.039 --> 1683.84
right so that's a just it's so

1674.08 --> 1683.84
20 20.

1688.32 --> 1693.4399999999998
anyway yeah the title of the hangout how

1690.32 --> 1696.72
to bend space time to cause a force

1693.44 --> 1700.0800000000002
it's of course a challenge because

1696.72 --> 1703.679
yeah if you could actually do that

1700.08 --> 1705.36
then you could well prove gravity with

1703.679 --> 1707.919
it empirically if you can actually

1705.36 --> 1709.6789999999999
physically do this

1707.919 --> 1711.1200000000001
bending space time to cause force

1709.679 --> 1714.159
because that that would

1711.12 --> 1716.08
bring everything into place

1714.159 --> 1718.0
that everybody that's trying to figure

1716.08 --> 1719.1999999999998
out what gravity is pursuing the proof

1718.0 --> 1724.559
for gravity

1719.2 --> 1728.0800000000002
is what they're all so eager to get

1724.559 --> 1730.8799999999999
the thing is though that i can describe

1728.08 --> 1733.84
it or express what it is doesn't mean

1730.88 --> 1739.3600000000001
that you can actually do it

1733.84 --> 1741.76
but you can think of doing it

1739.36 --> 1743.84
rumpus has the equations just waiting

1741.76 --> 1752.399
for him to present them

1743.84 --> 1754.0
yeah we've heard that one before

1752.399 --> 1756.399
rompus was still going to make a ray

1754.0 --> 1758.88
tracing model utilizing terrestrial

1756.399 --> 1760.799
refraction

1758.88 --> 1764.0
so yeah he actually said that he could

1760.799 --> 1767.44
do that now i highly doubt that that is

1764.0 --> 1769.76
actually possible because of

1767.44 --> 1771.44
just the nature of just calculating

1769.76 --> 1775.2
things

1771.44 --> 1777.76
it's almost impossible i think

1775.2 --> 1778.799
don't know for sure but it's like very

1777.76 --> 1782.399
you have to like

1778.799 --> 1786.08
a continuous alteration type fractal

1782.399 --> 1789.279
model approach to try

1786.08 --> 1792.559
and get a curved surface bent into

1789.279 --> 1794.64
a perfectly flat plane it's it's

1792.559 --> 1798.08
seemingly impossible the other way

1794.64 --> 1800.159
around would be a lot easier

1798.08 --> 1802.1589999999999
because you start with a flat vantage

1800.159 --> 1803.919
point and then you just bend it

1802.159 --> 1805.44
through r but to do it the other way

1803.919 --> 1809.8400000000001
around

1805.44 --> 1812.24
like reversed r to achieve that to

1809.84 --> 1813.9189999999999
basically have a rendered model of it

1812.24 --> 1818.24
like the geometry would be

1813.919 --> 1820.48
spherical and then overlook it

1818.24 --> 1822.799
and then apply a terrestrial refraction

1820.48 --> 1823.279
that bends it all into that flat plane

1822.799 --> 1826.8799999999999
well

1823.279 --> 1830.08
good luck with that like yeah you can

1826.88 --> 1832.7990000000002
theorize that that it should be

1830.08 --> 1834.1589999999999
possible but to actually achieve that

1832.799 --> 1837.76
then you have to

1834.159 --> 1839.919
yeah create like

1837.76 --> 1843.84
a system that'll actually do that and

1839.919 --> 1843.8400000000001
it's just extremely complicated

1843.919 --> 1848.159
to all cram that perfectly perfectly

1847.2 --> 1852.559
accounted for

1848.159 --> 1865.6000000000001
into into a mathematical formula

1852.559 --> 1869.039
it might be impossible

1865.6 --> 1879.84
phrased array optics i

1869.039 --> 1879.84
don't know what that is

1880.399 --> 1884.7199999999998
no i'm not in contact with ranty i hear

1884.0 --> 1887.76
he's still

1884.72 --> 1887.76
he's still going

1888.32 --> 1892.399
but i don't really keep track there's

1890.24 --> 1894.159
others like in flat

1892.399 --> 1907.84
among the flatter debate crew that do

1894.159 --> 1907.8400000000001
keep track i don't really

1908.159 --> 1915.2
but if it's going to be relevant to

1911.76 --> 1918.559
flat earth debate debating to arguments

1915.2 --> 1921.8400000000001
then usually the guys bring it up on the

1918.559 --> 1921.84
on the live show

1955.6 --> 1961.1999999999998
dynamically controlling the optical

1958.24 --> 1963.84
properties of a surface

1961.2 --> 1963.8400000000001
a surface

1974.84 --> 1980.0
okay

1977.6 --> 1982.24
but it is on the microscopic scale

1980.0 --> 1982.24
though

1984.399 --> 1988.32
i think in that sense there's a lot more

1986.96 --> 1991.679
control

1988.32 --> 1994.559
over what's going on well in the actual

1991.679 --> 1997.8400000000001
out there scale of the world

1994.559 --> 2000.6399999999999
there is a dynamic system

1997.84 --> 2004.799
with in homogeneous gases and all that

2000.64 --> 2006.5590000000002
and gets very complicated

2004.799 --> 2008.8799999999999
so it's not the same thing it's just

2006.559 --> 2012.08
like equating

2008.88 --> 2015.7600000000002
throwing liquid liquid

2012.08 --> 2017.6789999999999
gases on a round surface and then

2015.76 --> 2019.279
like zooming in on it and it's like oh

2017.679 --> 2022.0800000000002
look it bends to

2019.279 --> 2024.0
behind it right yeah that's a false

2022.08 --> 2026.799
equivalent it's not the same skill it's

2024.0 --> 2029.6
false equification i think

2026.799 --> 2033.6
so yeah that's not really proof that it

2029.6 --> 2037.279
works like that in the real world

2033.6 --> 2037.279
because the scale does matter

2044.24 --> 2061.839
raised array rave radio radar

2047.6 --> 2061.839
oh god i don't know

2062.24 --> 2075.7599999999998
this is getting very technical i don't

2064.159 --> 2080.2400000000002
know anything about that specifically

2075.76 --> 2080.2400000000002
i i'd have to look up phrase there a

2080.32 --> 2092.82
to see what that is

2089.63 --> 2092.82
[Music]

2097.03 --> 2100.079
[Music]

2100.839 --> 2103.839
hmm

2103.92 --> 2107.92
part of antenna theory

2114.839 --> 2117.839
interesting

2127.119 --> 2145.839
okay the right optics

2148.32 --> 2154.96
wow this is not convoluted at all

2151.68 --> 2157.359
yes it is holy [ __ ] phrased array optics

2154.96 --> 2160.56
is technology of controlling the

2157.359 --> 2173.839
phase and amplitude of light

2160.56 --> 2173.839
waves transmitting okay

2177.839 --> 2182.16
all right but it is basically the

2179.28 --> 2182.1600000000003
manipulation

2184.56 --> 2190.88
of light direction through yeah

2187.76 --> 2193.119
adjustable surface elements

2190.88 --> 2197.2000000000003
that's what it's described here but yeah

2193.119 --> 2200.2400000000002
it also presupposes that light is a wave

2197.2 --> 2215.839
which is kind of funny to me

2200.24 --> 2215.839
because it's not

2217.839 --> 2220.0789999999997
right

2220.96 --> 2224.32
but anyway look even phrased array

2223.92 --> 2226.88
that's

2224.32 --> 2230.079
interesting that you can actively start

2226.88 --> 2230.079
bending optics

2230.24 --> 2233.5989999999997
in the real world like that it's very

2232.48 --> 2236.96
interesting

2233.599 --> 2240.1600000000003
but what i was referring to is

2236.96 --> 2241.68
a mathematical model for terrestrial

2240.16 --> 2245.5989999999997
refraction

2241.68 --> 2249.52
to create a ray traced emulation

2245.599 --> 2250.56
of an actual sphere like the geometry of

2249.52 --> 2253.599
earth's sphere

2250.56 --> 2256.48
overlooking it and then yeah applying

2253.599 --> 2259.76
the terrestrial refraction mechanic

2256.48 --> 2262.88
in order to make it look like you're

2259.76 --> 2265.6800000000003
looking over a flat plane

2262.88 --> 2266.7200000000003
and i think that part is extremely

2265.68 --> 2268.3999999999996
difficult

2266.72 --> 2269.7599999999998
it has nothing to do with actual

2268.4 --> 2272.56
manipulation of

2269.76 --> 2272.96
real visuals has to do with the math

2272.56 --> 2276.88
math

2272.96 --> 2281.2
the math behind yeah

2276.88 --> 2283.76
turning a visual sphere

2281.2 --> 2285.1189999999997
into a flat plane being able to also

2283.76 --> 2289.5200000000004
cause you to see

2285.119 --> 2293.839
beyond the the geometric horizon which

2289.52 --> 2296.839
would be there on a sphere right that

2293.839 --> 2298.72
that part is extremely difficult if not

2296.839 --> 2302.0
impossible

2298.72 --> 2304.8799999999997
and rumpus promised that like in 2017 he

2302.0 --> 2304.88
was gonna do that

2305.599 --> 2309.119
it's a long time ago but i don't see

2308.4 --> 2313.839
that he can

2309.119 --> 2313.839
i don't know how he could do that

2317.57 --> 2321.6290000000004
[Music]

2335.44 --> 2340.7200000000003
okay yeah stone monkey 3d yeah i

2337.92 --> 2344.0
understand yeah the

2340.72 --> 2346.3999999999996
phrased array mechanic

2344.0 --> 2347.28
indeed it explained that by certain

2346.4 --> 2351.839
types of

2347.28 --> 2355.599
yeah steering the output you can direct

2351.839 --> 2358.0
a yeah a physically passive

2355.599 --> 2360.6400000000003
antenna system like using multiple

2358.0 --> 2364.32
antennas and then the way you

2360.64 --> 2367.52
i guess distribute the intensity

2364.32 --> 2368.88
it yeah it causes a directional change

2367.52 --> 2372.24
apparently

2368.88 --> 2383.839
that is it is fascinating

2372.24 --> 2383.839
that that works

2385.49 --> 2388.68
[Music]

2394.839 --> 2397.839
um

2408.839 --> 2411.839
uh

2436.58 --> 2439.92
[Music]

2437.839 --> 2439.92
you

2452.86 --> 2457.44
[Music]

2454.4 --> 2459.6800000000003
well when it comes to like i can't sort

2457.44 --> 2460.56
of on the surface figure out how that

2459.68 --> 2465.359
would work

2460.56 --> 2468.0
that phrased array directing of a signal

2465.359 --> 2469.44
it does seem logical like if there is a

2468.0 --> 2472.0
whole array

2469.44 --> 2475.52
several antennas they're all going to be

2472.0 --> 2475.52
sending in all directions but

2475.839 --> 2483.2799999999997
because they are yeah

2479.76 --> 2484.96
distributed as in a square

2483.28 --> 2486.48
there's going to be like this

2484.96 --> 2490.7200000000003
synchronicity this

2486.48 --> 2493.2
parallel motion of motion

2490.72 --> 2497.2
parallel distribution of the signals

2493.2 --> 2497.2
upwards because that's what they're all

2497.68 --> 2502.0
yeah lined up like so they're all going

2500.319 --> 2503.599
to be

2502.0 --> 2505.76
that yeah that's probably what makes

2503.599 --> 2507.76
them direct the signal because they're

2505.76 --> 2510.3190000000004
technically going in all directions but

2507.76 --> 2512.2400000000002
because the signal is parallel i guess

2510.319 --> 2513.04
with all the antennas in the upward

2512.24 --> 2514.72
direction

2513.04 --> 2516.16
which is the direction that the array

2514.72 --> 2519.1189999999997
would be facing

2516.16 --> 2519.92
that makes sense that it would almost

2519.119 --> 2522.7200000000003
create like a

2519.92 --> 2523.92
more focused beam of of the parallel

2522.72 --> 2526.0789999999997
signals

2523.92 --> 2527.28
into that direction and then by

2526.079 --> 2531.3590000000004
adjusting the

2527.28 --> 2535.119
intensity on the array

2531.359 --> 2539.5989999999997
yeah that effect could cause it to

2535.119 --> 2542.48
direct to adjust the direction of

2539.599 --> 2546.319
the parallel effect as it were so i yeah

2542.48 --> 2546.319
i can't imagine that that could work

2547.52 --> 2551.839
it's interesting

2581.68 --> 2593.839
it's just a system make your own

2602.48 --> 2611.119
right but anyway it's the adjusted array

2607.76 --> 2615.119
the directing it it is all based on

2611.119 --> 2615.119
radio signals right

2615.28 --> 2622.3190000000004
so those are waves as far as i

2618.96 --> 2625.04
know at least they're being represented

2622.319 --> 2625.04
as waves

2625.92 --> 2631.599
so taking that into account that's how i

2629.68 --> 2634.96
was able to figure out like okay

2631.599 --> 2637.6800000000003
so if you have these balls of

2634.96 --> 2639.119
waves basically going in all direction

2637.68 --> 2642.96
based on the antenna

2639.119 --> 2644.7200000000003
if you then have several of those things

2642.96 --> 2646.2400000000002
parallel to one another then there's

2644.72 --> 2650.24
going to be almost like a

2646.24 --> 2654.72
front of yeah of waves

2650.24 --> 2657.9199999999996
at the top upward direction

2654.72 --> 2660.64
because it's all very parallel there

2657.92 --> 2662.48
and then that way i think you're yeah

2660.64 --> 2665.68
you can

2662.48 --> 2668.079
alter the intensity

2665.68 --> 2671.1189999999997
of several antennas to basically almost

2668.079 --> 2674.96
like slant

2671.119 --> 2677.28
how the top side ah it's it's

2674.96 --> 2678.319
difficult yeah it's difficult to explain

2677.28 --> 2680.1600000000003
because

2678.319 --> 2682.16
would be expressed mathematically but

2680.16 --> 2685.44
it's just very visual to me

2682.16 --> 2688.8799999999997
it makes visual sense

2685.44 --> 2690.64
but i'm i'm yeah i'm

2688.88 --> 2691.92
dropping the ball a little when it comes

2690.64 --> 2705.839
to trying to

2691.92 --> 2705.839
explain it it's difficult to explain it

2712.4 --> 2719.76
yeah that's right iron 26 it's basically

2715.2 --> 2723.2799999999997
altering the direction of the

2719.76 --> 2726.4
of the focused beam from the an

2723.28 --> 2727.44
array point on it doesn't just go in a

2726.4 --> 2730.839
circular

2727.44 --> 2732.2400000000002
pattern from there on it is just the

2730.839 --> 2746.7999999999997
redirecting

2732.24 --> 2749.1189999999997
of the optimal signal

2746.8 --> 2749.119
what

2750.56 --> 2754.88
wait what so it's bending no

2756.8 --> 2765.2000000000003
it's not bending it's just

2760.96 --> 2768.64
the beam coming forth from the array

2765.2 --> 2771.2
is yeah angular wise

2768.64 --> 2771.92
altered so it just goes in a different

2771.2 --> 2775.4399999999996
direction

2771.92 --> 2779.04
from the array there's no bending

2775.44 --> 2779.04
after that point of the signal

2785.52 --> 2789.92
it's just the redirection of the yeah

2787.839 --> 2803.839
the optimal beam

2789.92 --> 2803.839
you could call it sort of a beam

2811.92 --> 2816.64
yeah so you don't know how it works does

2814.16 --> 2820.0
it mean it's not real

2816.64 --> 2822.24
well that's why i'm literally

2820.0 --> 2824.64
right now after being confronted with

2822.24 --> 2827.04
this concept for the very first time

2824.64 --> 2829.359
ever i've never heard of this before

2827.04 --> 2831.52
that's why i'm literally now on the spot

2829.359 --> 2834.16
figuring it out

2831.52 --> 2834.72
to see yeah that kind of makes sense

2834.16 --> 2838.0
that

2834.72 --> 2842.0
now that i think about it

2838.0 --> 2844.0
this is probably how they figured it out

2842.0 --> 2846.8
and then i understand it suddenly even

2844.0 --> 2849.04
though it's the very first time

2846.8 --> 2850.079
i've ever been confronted with it i i

2849.04 --> 2854.079
can

2850.079 --> 2857.3590000000004
quickly imagine how it would work

2854.079 --> 2858.96
and i bet you i'm not far off i'll bet

2857.359 --> 2861.119
you

2858.96 --> 2865.359
that i got it right in my approach like

2861.119 --> 2865.359
how that redirection actually works

2866.72 --> 2870.9599999999996
but yeah there it doesn't actually

2869.04 --> 2873.839
provide any sort of

2870.96 --> 2876.0
evidence or groundworks that is viable

2873.839 --> 2876.0
in

2876.4 --> 2881.599
in terrestrial refraction because it's

2880.079 --> 2884.96
radio signals it's not

2881.599 --> 2888.4
light that

2884.96 --> 2893.04
the the phased array

2888.4 --> 2898.0
doesn't really work for optics

2893.04 --> 2902.72
like that it's weird that they call it

2898.0 --> 2902.72
phase array light waves transmitting

2912.839 --> 2917.52
it's

2914.48 --> 2919.359
like they call it an optical

2917.52 --> 2920.72
array but i bet you there's no real

2919.359 --> 2923.52
light happening

2920.72 --> 2924.3999999999996
so i think it's just ground it's

2923.52 --> 2926.64
technology

2924.4 --> 2930.1600000000003
grounded again in the pre-assumption

2926.64 --> 2930.16
that it is all one thing

2930.48 --> 2936.96
that light is the same as radio

2933.76 --> 2938.92
and that like see it's it i think it's

2936.96 --> 2942.2400000000002
coming forth from that

2938.92 --> 2944.8
unification reification

2942.24 --> 2946.16
that happened and it's all one thing and

2944.8 --> 2949.2000000000003
then they just

2946.16 --> 2949.2
move yeah move

2949.68 --> 2955.5989999999997
move around with that to confuse things

2953.359 --> 2957.5989999999997
because this phased array optics

2955.599 --> 2959.2000000000003
i don't see how this has anything to do

2957.599 --> 2961.6800000000003
with optics

2959.2 --> 2971.839
or light like even from what they

2961.68 --> 2971.839
describe here

2972.24 --> 2976.24
although this is different yeah what

2974.72 --> 2978.16
they're talking about holograms

2976.24 --> 2979.839
oh i need to look at this page a little

2978.16 --> 2982.7999999999997
bit more carefully i might be

2979.839 --> 2982.7999999999997
yeah messing it up

2982.88 --> 2986.8
the optics part is something separate i

2985.839 --> 2992.16
think

2986.8 --> 2992.1600000000003
it might be inspired on the same concept

2996.839 --> 3002.0
this

2998.72 --> 3013.839
complicated i'm gonna literally now look

3002.0 --> 3013.839
it up and read some of this

3055.599 --> 3059.44
okay even from what i'm reading in

3058.16 --> 3062.0
wikipedia about

3059.44 --> 3064.2400000000002
wikipedia about phased array optics it's

3062.0 --> 3064.24
just

3064.96 --> 3069.839
it doesn't explain a whole lot

3073.359 --> 3079.68
this just says like it it does this

3076.0 --> 3083.839
doesn't say how it actually does that

3079.68 --> 3083.839
it's just a pretty rough description

3107.68 --> 3112.3999999999996
wow yeah this is all getting

3110.8 --> 3114.2400000000002
i think this has to do also with

3112.4 --> 3115.6800000000003
holographics they're mentioning that you

3114.24 --> 3118.5589999999997
can even make

3115.68 --> 3118.5589999999997
holograms

3118.72 --> 3125.839
using dynamic face very phase

3122.16 --> 3125.839
variation poof

3126.8 --> 3132.2400000000002
so this is a bit heavy stuff

3137.599 --> 3143.119
it is kind of weird because they just

3140.72 --> 3145.9199999999996
assume light is waves they're just

3143.119 --> 3149.44
taking it as such

3145.92 --> 3152.4
and then and then they don't really

3149.44 --> 3155.8
describe the process too well of how

3152.4 --> 3158.989
that's actually supposed to work

3155.8 --> 3158.989
[Music]

3159.76 --> 3167.8390000000004
the interference yeah it doesn't really

3162.64 --> 3167.839
explain a lot though

3191.04 --> 3198.079
turret 30c what

3194.319 --> 3201.599
what is an npc and i know what it is but

3198.079 --> 3201.599
what do you think it is

3201.68 --> 3209.839
i think a lot of yeah to assume that

3204.4 --> 3209.839
people are nobody

3210.24 --> 3214.0
because that is kind of what it assumes

3212.0 --> 3216.64
is that you don't really have any

3214.0 --> 3216.64
available

3216.72 --> 3220.72
that you don't have a wide array of

3218.48 --> 3223.2
feelings and faculties and all that

3220.72 --> 3224.9599999999996
in order to really become an

3223.2 --> 3228.64
individualized person with an

3224.96 --> 3228.64
individualized will or something

3228.72 --> 3233.04
i think a lot of people are just very

3234.319 --> 3239.839
they're just downsized everything about

3237.2 --> 3239.839
themselves

3240.559 --> 3245.2000000000003
i think that in a technical sense i

3244.72 --> 3248.319
think that

3245.2 --> 3251.4399999999996
every npc can even

3248.319 --> 3254.88
wake up from that it's just often too

3251.44 --> 3259.92
punishing why do people

3254.88 --> 3259.92
become npcs because they

3260.96 --> 3267.76
don't want to handle what it is

3265.839 --> 3269.2
that makes you an individual and that is

3267.76 --> 3271.5200000000004
basically the suffering and the

3269.2 --> 3273.04
realization and the confrontation and

3271.52 --> 3274.8
taking the punishment taking the

3273.04 --> 3276.72
responsibility and

3274.8 --> 3278.319
because they try to systematically

3276.72 --> 3281.68
escape from that

3278.319 --> 3281.68
they always seek out

3281.839 --> 3287.599
easy railroads to become a part of

3285.2 --> 3289.5989999999997
groups to become a part of and that kind

3287.599 --> 3291.28
of makes them an npc it doesn't mean

3289.599 --> 3293.44
that they don't have

3291.28 --> 3295.599
an individual inside it just means that

3293.44 --> 3298.7200000000003
they

3295.599 --> 3299.52
are trying to not go with that probably

3298.72 --> 3301.68
because

3299.52 --> 3303.839
it's too punishing or they're too afraid

3301.68 --> 3303.839
and

3305.2 --> 3321.839
so in that sense no i don't think that

3307.359 --> 3321.839
there's such a thing as an npc

3324.96 --> 3333.119
i think that in a way an npc is a choice

3329.839 --> 3337.599
which includes the repeated

3333.119 --> 3337.599
choice to act like you're stupid

3338.079 --> 3341.599
because if you act like you're stupid

3340.4 --> 3343.52
then people

3341.599 --> 3345.76
trying to confront you with complicated

3343.52 --> 3347.28
things will often end up just going away

3345.76 --> 3350.2400000000002
like oh you're just too stupid

3347.28 --> 3350.6400000000003
and then you don't have to listen to all

3350.24 --> 3353.52
those

3350.64 --> 3354.799
heavy things and get all restless from

3353.52 --> 3359.119
it see

3354.799 --> 3359.119
npc npc is a choice

3360.16 --> 3363.839
it's like a fallback position

3364.799 --> 3368.079
or autopilot

3368.16 --> 3371.2
it's always a choice

3372.64 --> 3376.319
and if you make that choice long enough

3375.2 --> 3380.8799999999997
then eventually

3376.319 --> 3380.88
you will believe it is the only choice

3382.319 --> 3391.839
that there is no other choice than to be

3384.72 --> 3391.839
like an npc

3404.0 --> 3410.24
all right being stuck at low level of

3406.079 --> 3412.48
awareness and not evolving our npcs

3410.24 --> 3412.4799999999996
right

3414.96 --> 3420.799
but that really doesn't justify

3418.319 --> 3423.52
what it stands for which is a non-player

3420.799 --> 3423.52
character so

3423.599 --> 3429.119
it wouldn't be it's just somebody stuck

3425.839 --> 3432.24
on a lower level awareness

3429.119 --> 3434.1600000000003
doesn't make them a non-player it just

3432.24 --> 3436.0789999999997
makes them a

3434.16 --> 3438.5589999999997
player that doesn't really give a [ __ ]

3436.079 --> 3442.2400000000002
like in game terminologies

3438.559 --> 3444.1600000000003
it wouldn't be a little robot that is

3442.24 --> 3447.4399999999996
the part of the story for the

3444.16 --> 3448.319
the player to experience and they don't

3447.44 --> 3451.04
really matter

3448.319 --> 3451.839
after the experience part for the player

3451.04 --> 3455.2
is over

3451.839 --> 3457.44
which that is what an npc is no instead

3455.2 --> 3458.24
it would be just another player in the

3457.44 --> 3462.16
game

3458.24 --> 3465.2
that kind of gave up pretty quickly

3462.16 --> 3467.92
or that just plays the game

3465.2 --> 3469.1189999999997
in an ineffective way i think it's more

3467.92 --> 3471.04
comparable to that

3469.119 --> 3472.2400000000002
that isn't an npc because they are

3471.04 --> 3475.119
playing the game

3472.24 --> 3476.9599999999996
they're just not really doing a very

3475.119 --> 3479.52
good job at it

3476.96 --> 3479.52
so far

3479.91 --> 3482.949
[Music]

3483.2 --> 3489.839
nbc lives matter

3514.839 --> 3519.68
uh

3517.119 --> 3520.799
oh sir little wolf it's a bit of a poor

3519.68 --> 3524.799
metaphor to

3520.799 --> 3526.64
compare the bible bible's description of

3524.799 --> 3528.079
how to get into heaven to a computer

3526.64 --> 3531.839
game

3528.079 --> 3531.8390000000004
but i understand

3550.43 --> 3553.5699999999997
[Music]

3555.9 --> 3559.07
[Music]

3559.92 --> 3573.839
diablo 2. man that's a long time ago

3562.64 --> 3573.839
since i last played that

3576.079 --> 3587.8390000000004
not if you read the whole bible what are

3578.799 --> 3587.839
you talking about

3595.04 --> 3598.09
[Music]

3601.01 --> 3610.57
[Music]

3626.839 --> 3634.0
um

3629.68 --> 3643.839
hey this might no

3634.0 --> 3643.839
jet was stuck but it's not

3653.359 --> 3657.839
okay you think that is what it is

3662.0 --> 3671.839
that's quite the esoteric approach

3682.839 --> 3685.839
so

3689.04 --> 3694.319
oh have you ever considered that on a

3692.4 --> 3698.0
bit of an over generalized version that

3694.319 --> 3700.319
maybe it's just both

3698.0 --> 3702.079
know i approac i approach the whole

3700.319 --> 3707.599
bible

3702.079 --> 3710.319
not so exoteric not so literal like that

3707.599 --> 3712.1600000000003
i just see even almost like a

3710.319 --> 3715.52
development process for

3712.16 --> 3721.2799999999997
the program the design

3715.52 --> 3721.28
of this realm according to the designer

3722.24 --> 3727.4399999999996
the designers will like it expresses

3726.799 --> 3730.4
itself

3727.44 --> 3731.68
through the design through how things

3730.4 --> 3734.319
work

3731.68 --> 3735.359
and i think that we can learn a lot

3734.319 --> 3738.079
through the bible

3735.359 --> 3738.96
about how things work it's like

3738.079 --> 3742.88
everything that

3738.96 --> 3746.4
happens in it in the book is like

3742.88 --> 3751.28
it's their test it's tests

3746.4 --> 3751.28
and we get to learn from those tests

3751.839 --> 3757.0389999999998
and not everything is

3757.2 --> 3764.319
universal i think i think that just

3761.2 --> 3765.5989999999997
things that happen in there happen in

3764.319 --> 3769.839
that moment

3765.599 --> 3769.839
from those for those people

3770.24 --> 3777.52
and it's up to you to figure out why

3773.44 --> 3780.079
and how what is actually going on

3777.52 --> 3781.119
on a deeper esoteric level that if you

3780.079 --> 3784.7200000000003
could just get stuck

3781.119 --> 3787.76
on the specific words yeah you'll just

3784.72 --> 3790.48
endlessly dwell on that

3787.76 --> 3792.6400000000003
instead of actually finding the essence

3790.48 --> 3794.559
of the learning process that's going on

3792.64 --> 3811.7599999999998
and the revelation of

3794.559 --> 3813.6800000000003
the design of how things work

3811.76 --> 3815.039
that's why you don't follow the bible

3813.68 --> 3824.64
well why would you

3815.039 --> 3826.88
follow a book

3824.64 --> 3829.52
you seem to completely misunderstand the

3826.88 --> 3829.52
whole point

3832.88 --> 3839.359
like it's not like a cooking book

3836.48 --> 3841.119
level instruction manual you understand

3839.359 --> 3844.72
you read the bible it's not like

3841.119 --> 3847.839
this is literally what you have to do

3844.72 --> 3848.8799999999997
no it's revealing the nature of the

3847.839 --> 3853.44
design and

3848.88 --> 3855.359
how things have developed

3853.44 --> 3857.68
and if you understand that then from

3855.359 --> 3861.0389999999998
that you can derive where you should

3857.68 --> 3862.799
develop what is wisest what's the best

3861.039 --> 3865.8390000000004
way of doing things

3862.799 --> 3868.0
and it gives you a four look

3865.839 --> 3870.0
in how to deal with complicated

3868.0 --> 3880.77
situations and challenges which

3870.0 --> 3883.96
is what we need the most

3880.77 --> 3883.96
[Music]

3899.68 --> 3909.839
what's going on here

3914.24 --> 3918.799
well aries 106 have you ever considered

3916.64 --> 3918.799
that

3919.119 --> 3925.92
you might have a save game

3922.88 --> 3929.52
except the thing you experience is

3925.92 --> 3933.039
past that phase you already played

3929.52 --> 3936.16
the game of yourself

3933.039 --> 3939.44
and you as a conscious experience

3936.16 --> 3942.24
are just only able to experience

3939.44 --> 3943.76
the game that's already been played like

3942.24 --> 3947.5989999999997
you are the

3943.76 --> 3950.7200000000003
roll out movie you are the cut scene

3947.599 --> 3954.48
of your video game

3950.72 --> 3958.16
have you ever considered that it's how i

3954.48 --> 3961.28
i tend to look at reality

3958.16 --> 3964.24
like this is secondary this is the

3961.28 --> 3965.6800000000003
cut scene that i actually get to

3964.24 --> 3969.9199999999996
experience of the game

3965.68 --> 3969.9199999999996
that i'm playing outside of my

3976.839 --> 3979.839
consciousness

3984.2 --> 3987.37
[Music]

3990.16 --> 3993.839
yeah terrible

3994.4 --> 3999.6800000000003
jumanji type game no no that's all just

3996.96 --> 3999.68
video game

4004.839 --> 4007.839
stuff

4013.2 --> 4017.52
right because i think sometimes that the

4015.28 --> 4020.4
actual game that we play

4017.52 --> 4022.319
is literally the tension that we have

4020.4 --> 4024.4
inside the drive the will

4022.319 --> 4025.839
just the level of energy that is the

4024.4 --> 4027.839
actual game

4025.839 --> 4029.599
and what comes out of us and how we look

4027.839 --> 4032.4
at things and how we

4029.599 --> 4035.3590000000004
experience the world in reflection to

4032.4 --> 4037.6800000000003
everything that we carry inside

4035.359 --> 4039.5989999999997
that is the cutscene that is the roll

4037.68 --> 4042.319
out consequence of

4039.599 --> 4042.319
what we do

4047.28 --> 4049.76
uh-oh

4050.48 --> 4053.28
what's going on

4056.24 --> 4063.839
oh it's just youtube

4059.839 --> 4063.839
i thought

4066.72 --> 4072.64
yeah i thought that youtube was crashing

4069.039 --> 4072.6400000000003
or my internet was crashing but

4075.599 --> 4078.7200000000003
wow still going

4082.16 --> 4091.839
hey robin stanley good to see you

4095.359 --> 4101.6
does any anyone seen this

4098.4 --> 4101.599999999999
what seen what

4102.239 --> 4107.759
oh god yeah i've seen that it's pretty

4116.839 --> 4119.839
[ __ ]

4123.199 --> 4126.3189999999995
that's just people getting really

4125.279 --> 4129.759
triggered

4126.319 --> 4132.319
and so they then are inspired to compare

4129.759 --> 4134.319
it to nasty things because yeah they

4132.319 --> 4136.88
just can't handle it

4134.319 --> 4138.88
like i'm not going away and i'm gonna do

4136.88 --> 4141.679
more silly [ __ ]

4138.88 --> 4142.88
because i have that it's part of what i

4141.679 --> 4146.08
am

4142.88 --> 4148.96
and i want to and i am free to

4146.08 --> 4150.0
and i literally don't give a [ __ ] even

4148.96 --> 4152.64
if there is a

4150.0 --> 4154.96
million different people out there

4152.64 --> 4158.08
spending hundreds of hour

4154.96 --> 4160.319
hours making creative slandering shitty

4158.08 --> 4162.799
videos about me i don't give a

4160.319 --> 4162.799
[ __ ]

4164.0 --> 4169.839
that's been happening for years i

4165.92 --> 4169.839
already got over that like three years

4172.839 --> 4177.359
ago

4175.44 --> 4189.3589999999995
you think it's brilliant sex sterling

4177.359 --> 4193.120000000001
you do

4189.359 --> 4193.120000000001
what is brilliant zack sterling

4199.6 --> 4206.2390000000005
that to me it's just you don't see

4203.28 --> 4206.88
much of that kind of [ __ ] out there

4206.239 --> 4208.639999999999
so

4206.88 --> 4211.76
to me it's kind of telling like wow

4208.64 --> 4214.2390000000005
there's actually people that

4211.76 --> 4217.1990000000005
that really make these videos about they

4214.239 --> 4220.879999999999
really think about that

4217.199 --> 4223.199
like that almost makes me kind of

4220.88 --> 4226.719
special

4223.199 --> 4228.839999999999
that i actually get to people because

4226.719 --> 4230.8
there's other people out there that are

4228.84 --> 4233.92
just

4230.8 --> 4236.320000000001
bored they don't do [ __ ] so

4233.92 --> 4240.4800000000005
yeah i apparently what the hell somebody

4236.32 --> 4240.48
found another bag of fireworks out there

4242.4 --> 4245.839999999999
but your kids just running around

4251.679 --> 4256.0
all right what's that link

4256.08 --> 4259.6
yeah if you don't have a wrench you

4258.32 --> 4273.84
can't post links

4259.6 --> 4273.84
blank all right

4280.56 --> 4287.04
don't watch hit pieces

4283.92 --> 4289.04
well i've what watched a few of them

4287.04 --> 4291.6
and i actually thought that some of them

4289.04 --> 4294.4
were kind of amusing

4291.6 --> 4296.320000000001
it's just a part of me when i got really

4294.4 --> 4299.44
angry

4296.32 --> 4300.08
and then they think that is weakness and

4299.44 --> 4302.719
then they

4300.08 --> 4304.239
like do something stupid ridiculous

4302.719 --> 4306.88
behind that it's like oh

4304.239 --> 4307.678999999999
we've won because irwin got really

4306.88 --> 4309.92
pissed off

4307.679 --> 4310.88
and kind of like out of his mind angry

4309.92 --> 4314.159
at a point

4310.88 --> 4317.679
like oh my god because

4314.159 --> 4320.0
that happened they think that everything

4317.679 --> 4321.679
after that is somehow futile or

4320.0 --> 4324.0
something that's because i did that

4321.679 --> 4326.4
because i actually got that angry

4324.0 --> 4328.08
that means that everything i do from

4326.4 --> 4332.4
that point on is useless

4328.08 --> 4333.679
because i broke or something and that

4332.4 --> 4336.0
means that

4333.679 --> 4339.1990000000005
after that point you can never show your

4336.0 --> 4341.12
face again apparently

4339.199 --> 4343.04
the people that are making these videos

4341.12 --> 4346.159
they are all drowning

4343.04 --> 4349.199
in their own shame they're too

4346.159 --> 4351.679
afraid to do anything so they're just

4349.199 --> 4352.799999999999
trying to project all that shame they're

4351.679 --> 4355.6
running away from

4352.8 --> 4356.0
in themselves onto other people that

4355.6 --> 4358.96
don't

4356.0 --> 4358.96
run away from it

4361.28 --> 4371.84
okay my youtube just crashed

4365.199 --> 4371.839999999999
that's weird

4390.159 --> 4394.719
all right now in the past i actually

4393.04 --> 4396.96
went out and got

4394.719 --> 4398.0
went hunting for some videos because

4396.96 --> 4402.32
some of them were

4398.0 --> 4402.32
just really nasty disturbing

4403.04 --> 4407.12
but on the other hand there are also

4405.52 --> 4408.88
videos out there that are

4407.12 --> 4410.8
like they are disturbing but they're

4408.88 --> 4413.28
still kind of funny

4410.8 --> 4416.2390000000005
and to go after that seems almost like a

4413.28 --> 4418.08
crime against art

4416.239 --> 4420.48
because not it's not that i truly

4418.08 --> 4423.76
appreciate those videos but

4420.48 --> 4424.718999999999
it like there is some kind of creativity

4423.76 --> 4427.1990000000005
in them and then

4424.719 --> 4430.88
it's like okay well that makes it all

4427.199 --> 4430.879999999999
right then i can't really touch it

4433.12 --> 4437.679
so i did go after a couple videos that

4435.36 --> 4440.799999999999
were just kind of boring and

4437.679 --> 4443.6
just just mean-spirited and slandering

4440.8 --> 4446.400000000001
there was nothing funny about it

4443.6 --> 4448.08
i went and basically got those videos

4446.4 --> 4451.599999999999
removed and blocked and all that [ __ ]

4448.08 --> 4453.36
that's like years ago now

4451.6 --> 4454.88
and i have noticed that since then

4453.36 --> 4457.12
there's a lot more

4454.88 --> 4458.88
new newer videos although not as much as

4457.12 --> 4462.719
back then

4458.88 --> 4465.1990000000005
but more more of them are now just funny

4462.719 --> 4466.159
and i kind of like that it's okay let

4465.199 --> 4468.639999999999
the internet be

4466.159 --> 4471.12
filled with just oh look at the crazy

4468.64 --> 4474.08
arwen oh he's such a flat earther oh

4471.12 --> 4475.44
oh we associate him with everything that

4474.08 --> 4479.12
is horror or movie

4475.44 --> 4481.199
disgusting nightmarish haunting things

4479.12 --> 4482.159
that get you in your sleep and all the

4481.199 --> 4487.44
yeah yeah

4482.159 --> 4487.44
that's me that's me in your head

4487.76 --> 4490.88
but they don't see that

4491.12 --> 4494.719
that they are basically placing me on a

4493.6 --> 4498.88
pedestal

4494.719 --> 4502.4
in a pit and just

4498.88 --> 4505.4400000000005
worshipping me at a distance out of fear

4502.4 --> 4505.44
that's what they're doing

4505.6 --> 4512.0
it's not gonna influence my spirit a lot

4509.199 --> 4514.32
but it is like a big signal like hey i

4512.0 --> 4517.199
am actually

4514.32 --> 4518.239
getting out there and touching people in

4517.199 --> 4521.5199999999995
places that

4518.239 --> 4523.5199999999995
nobody usually touches them

4521.52 --> 4525.280000000001
they can't reach they can't normally be

4523.52 --> 4528.8
reached

4525.28 --> 4528.8
but i apparently reach them

4532.719 --> 4537.44
because otherwise they wouldn't be

4533.92 --> 4540.719
making these weird videos about me

4537.44 --> 4542.719
so yeah i'm okay with that and hey if

4540.719 --> 4546.32
they're actually kind of funny

4542.719 --> 4546.32
then i even encourage it

4548.56 --> 4552.320000000001
let's not take it too far i don't

4550.0 --> 4555.52
literally encourage it but

4552.32 --> 4557.84
yeah i leave them alone i'll even have a

4555.52 --> 4560.400000000001
laugh about it sometime

4557.84 --> 4561.84
but it has to actually be funny in some

4560.4 --> 4567.839999999999
way

4561.84 --> 4567.84
and not just disgusting and nasty

4568.55 --> 4573.49
[Music]

4573.6 --> 4578.719
aries 106 well what does that have to do

4575.84 --> 4581.6
with what i said and well nothing

4578.719 --> 4584.159
it's just their disgusting horror

4581.6 --> 4587.280000000001
projection unto me because

4584.159 --> 4591.839999999999
i am that horrific to them

4587.28 --> 4594.4
because i go places where it burns us

4591.84 --> 4596.400000000001
for them it is like i am opening the

4594.4 --> 4600.08
gates to hell

4596.4 --> 4602.719
and that hell is reaching out for them

4600.08 --> 4605.28
and it burns us so they have to like

4602.719 --> 4609.84
create some kind of mockery

4605.28 --> 4609.84
to try and close the gate

4610.239 --> 4614.718999999999
because i'm opening up their hell gates

4612.56 --> 4617.679
i'm confronting them with things that

4614.719 --> 4622.0
they need to be confronted with

4617.679 --> 4626.56
that'll wake them up

4622.0 --> 4626.56
that hurts so yeah

4626.64 --> 4632.8
that's why they associate that

4630.239 --> 4634.48
because that movie was pretty ridiculous

4632.8 --> 4636.64
and disgusting

4634.48 --> 4637.599999999999
and yeah they prefer that because

4636.64 --> 4640.08
ridiculous

4637.6 --> 4640.96
and disgusting is kind of like oh it's

4640.08 --> 4642.8
horror

4640.96 --> 4644.64
but it's also kind of funny so you can

4642.8 --> 4645.1990000000005
keep your distance sort of so they're

4644.64 --> 4648.56
just

4645.199 --> 4649.04
trying desperately to somehow get some

4648.56 --> 4652.0
kind of

4649.04 --> 4654.32
imagery associated for them and they

4652.0 --> 4657.84
project it outward with the video

4654.32 --> 4661.04
to try and defuse me

4657.84 --> 4661.4400000000005
arwyn the wizard that is opening up the

4661.04 --> 4664.64
hell

4661.44 --> 4667.599999999999
gate for them specifically and it

4664.64 --> 4669.76
burns us and i keep on doing i keep on

4667.6 --> 4670.2390000000005
opening up that hell gate and it burns

4669.76 --> 4674.08
them

4670.239 --> 4676.32
yes i know i know keep on doing it

4674.08 --> 4677.5199999999995
yeah and your stupid little videos is

4676.32 --> 4681.679
not going to stop it

4677.52 --> 4685.1990000000005
i'm just gonna keep on opening that gate

4681.679 --> 4686.8
until you finally do something about

4685.199 --> 4690.08
yourself

4686.8 --> 4690.4800000000005
and get rid of the sin so when i open up

4690.08 --> 4694.159
that

4690.48 --> 4697.759999999999
gate it doesn't burn you anymore as much

4694.159 --> 4697.759999999999
that's what you actually have to do

4701.87 --> 4706.719
[Music]

4704.719 --> 4707.84
what happened with the topic from the

4706.719 --> 4710.8
title

4707.84 --> 4711.679
uh it was kind of a misleading title on

4710.8 --> 4715.04
purpose

4711.679 --> 4715.679
stone monkey 3d because you can't

4715.04 --> 4718.96
actually

4715.679 --> 4723.84
bend space time to cause a force

4718.96 --> 4726.96
but everybody that believes in gravity

4723.84 --> 4727.6
from the baller side especially wants to

4726.96 --> 4731.36
do this

4727.6 --> 4733.360000000001
they want to find this

4731.36 --> 4734.639999999999
this is like the golden pot below the

4733.36 --> 4737.04
rainbow to them

4734.64 --> 4739.280000000001
how to bend space time to cause a force

4737.04 --> 4742.96
it's literally the golden pot behind

4739.28 --> 4748.639999999999
below the rainbow for the ballers

4742.96 --> 4763.84
this is the solution they're looking for

4748.64 --> 4763.84
this is what they're trying to achieve

4769.43 --> 4777.84
[Music]

4774.84 --> 4777.84
hmm

4788.84 --> 4791.84
what

4804.159 --> 4807.92
yeah it's what wazzo it is a bit of a

4806.0 --> 4811.679
crack by pripe

4807.92 --> 4811.679
crack pipe dream indeed

4812.56 --> 4819.84
and no iron 26 bendy space time is not

4817.36 --> 4819.839999999999
coriolis

4820.639 --> 4829.4400000000005
coriolis is just an apparent deviation

4825.44 --> 4829.44
because of the difference of reference

4830.84 --> 4833.84
frame

4834.88 --> 4837.6900000000005
now space-time is actually a conceptual

4837.12 --> 4838.96
medium

4837.69 --> 4843.678999999999
[Music]

4838.96 --> 4846.96
where in time is reified as if it was a

4843.679 --> 4850.2390000000005
another spatial dimension

4846.96 --> 4852.2390000000005
utilizing mass to unify it in the

4850.239 --> 4855.599999999999
conceptual medium and then it

4852.239 --> 4860.159
that the bending of it

4855.6 --> 4864.0
whatever that even like bending already

4860.159 --> 4867.12
like how does the medium bend

4864.0 --> 4868.0
see it is even to say bending of

4867.12 --> 4871.599999999999
space-time

4868.0 --> 4874.4
is already per default nonsensical

4871.6 --> 4875.6
it just doesn't make any sense it it

4874.4 --> 4878.719
stimulates

4875.6 --> 4880.4800000000005
certain thinking but it ends up in a

4878.719 --> 4883.6
broken psychotic state

4880.48 --> 4886.239
like it doesn't it just

4883.6 --> 4888.400000000001
doesn't make any damn sense literally

4886.239 --> 4889.599999999999
mechanically it makes no sense it's

4888.4 --> 4891.599999999999
suggestible

4889.6 --> 4893.76
but there's actually nothing logically

4891.6 --> 4896.08
there it just doesn't make any damn

4893.76 --> 4896.08
sense

4899.04 --> 4917.84
hey miss kang happy new year to you

4903.6 --> 4917.84
yeah i've been doing pretty good

4918.88 --> 4923.36
what a reference point thing observer c

4921.6 --> 4926.639
band traveler c straight

4923.36 --> 4930.719
well that's again just a metaphor

4926.639 --> 4932.2390000000005
it is a metaphor iron 26

4930.719 --> 4934.0
because i do recognize what you're

4932.239 --> 4936.5599999999995
talking about

4934.0 --> 4937.44
observers he's bent travelers he's

4936.56 --> 4942.080000000001
straight

4937.44 --> 4945.919999999999
but that's again drawing it into their

4942.08 --> 4948.719
relativity thinking and again it doesn't

4945.92 --> 4951.12
actually it's again a description and

4948.719 --> 4954.719
meta for a comparison

4951.12 --> 4958.639
it doesn't actually make any literal

4954.719 --> 4961.199
sense it's a but metaphorically

4958.639 --> 4962.2390000000005
it can be described that doesn't

4961.199 --> 4964.799999999999
actually

4962.239 --> 4966.239
yeah explain what it is how it really

4964.8 --> 4969.4400000000005
works

4966.239 --> 4971.678999999999
it's just another description and yeah

4969.44 --> 4974.879999999999
space time and gravity these days is

4971.679 --> 4978.159
full of descriptions and drawings and

4974.88 --> 4981.52
models and we get used to seeing that

4978.159 --> 4984.5599999999995
it doesn't actually explain it though

4981.52 --> 4988.080000000001
it's all just metaphorical all of it

4984.56 --> 4990.320000000001
it doesn't actually explain it

4988.08 --> 4992.639
it's just a big parlor trick a mystery

4990.32 --> 4994.88
religion parlor trick

4992.639 --> 4997.36
make you think of something don't

4994.88 --> 5000.400000000001
provide the explanation

4997.36 --> 5002.48
and eventually you stop inquiring to the

5000.4 --> 5005.679
explanation and you just settle

5002.48 --> 5009.12
for the metaphor say that is it and

5005.679 --> 5013.28
you don't even realize anymore that con

5009.12 --> 5016.639
drawing the conclusion that is it

5013.28 --> 5018.96
is already a misunderstanding

5016.639 --> 5019.84
because it is not it it's just a

5018.96 --> 5022.96
metaphor

5019.84 --> 5025.1990000000005
every time it's just a description that

5022.96 --> 5027.04
is not actually it

5025.199 --> 5029.199
and they do this every time and we got

5027.04 --> 5032.4
so used to this

5029.199 --> 5037.04
everybody that you start to forget

5032.4 --> 5037.04
that it doesn't actually explain

5040.84 --> 5043.84
anything

5047.199 --> 5051.759999999999
if it's coriolis description well that

5049.04 --> 5054.8
is yeah but coriolis is still based on

5051.76 --> 5056.2390000000005
actual deviation

5054.8 --> 5058.639
and difference reference frame so

5056.239 --> 5062.4
there's real movement going on

5058.639 --> 5065.28
not just conceptual

5062.4 --> 5067.04
moving it's not just as if it no there's

5065.28 --> 5070.96
actual movement going on

5067.04 --> 5073.6
that will result in coriolis deviation

5070.96 --> 5074.4800000000005
it's just the observer is moving and not

5073.6 --> 5077.4400000000005
the things

5074.48 --> 5077.44
around them

5080.08 --> 5084.4
so it's just a displacement of the

5082.84 --> 5087.76
experience

5084.4 --> 5091.12
or f yeah the vantage point it draws the

5087.76 --> 5091.12
observation into the

5091.76 --> 5097.4400000000005
into the non-euclidean

5095.52 --> 5098.639
but that doesn't mean that the physical

5097.44 --> 5100.48
things

5098.639 --> 5104.32
that are experiencing to know that are

5100.48 --> 5106.4
not existing euclidean

5104.32 --> 5109.599999999999
it's yeah it's just it's an apparent

5106.4 --> 5109.599999999999
deviation it's just

5110.28 --> 5115.44
misplacing the emphasis on what is

5112.56 --> 5118.080000000001
moving and what is not

5115.44 --> 5118.879999999999
yeah it's the extr the let me say that

5118.08 --> 5122.32
accidental

5118.88 --> 5125.6
exchange a matter of perspective

5122.32 --> 5127.599999999999
an observer will typically assume

5125.6 --> 5130.2390000000005
that they are standing still and the

5127.6 --> 5133.76
world around them is moving

5130.239 --> 5137.919999999999
even if they are actually moving

5133.76 --> 5140.4800000000005
this can happen now if we travel in a

5137.92 --> 5142.96
straight line

5140.48 --> 5145.36
our minds don't make us believe that as

5142.96 --> 5148.639
much but when we

5145.36 --> 5151.199
move on a spinning thing

5148.639 --> 5153.1990000000005
then our brain does start to tell us

5151.199 --> 5155.5199999999995
this

5153.199 --> 5156.799999999999
you see and that is where the coriolis

5155.52 --> 5159.6
mistake

5156.8 --> 5161.12
comes in that's where the mind tricks

5159.6 --> 5162.88
whether the mind starts to play tricks

5161.12 --> 5163.599999999999
on us but when we move in a straight

5162.88 --> 5166.32
line

5163.6 --> 5167.76
our intuition very much sizes up what is

5166.32 --> 5169.12
happening things are coming from the

5167.76 --> 5171.12
distance

5169.12 --> 5172.719
and that does not make you think that

5171.12 --> 5174.48
you are

5172.719 --> 5175.76
standing still and the earth is moving

5174.48 --> 5177.599999999999
underneath you

5175.76 --> 5179.6
it doesn't give you that impression your

5177.6 --> 5183.04
brain doesn't tell you that as much

5179.6 --> 5187.84
compared to when you are on some kind of

5183.04 --> 5187.84
spinning object a rotating thing

5194.84 --> 5197.84
hmm

5201.52 --> 5204.8
no i i'm not going to play music in the

5203.76 --> 5210.88
background

5204.8 --> 5214.4800000000005
i'm not going to go there

5210.88 --> 5214.4800000000005
i'm not playing any music

5214.639 --> 5219.4400000000005
i have not in the past and i'm not going

5217.199 --> 5222.96
to in the future

5219.44 --> 5224.879999999999
because also by doing that i don't get

5222.96 --> 5228.4
bored of my own music and then

5224.88 --> 5230.400000000001
once you start up music it's very tough

5228.4 --> 5233.759999999999
to decide to drop it again because

5230.4 --> 5235.679
then is suddenly a silence right i know

5233.76 --> 5237.52
this that's why i choose not to use

5235.679 --> 5240.08
music i have intro music

5237.52 --> 5240.88
that's good enough for me all these

5240.08 --> 5244.639
people that

5240.88 --> 5246.4800000000005
take on music yeah oh it might seem oh

5244.639 --> 5248.96
look it's more high tech it's more

5246.48 --> 5250.959999999999
update but they don't realize that once

5248.96 --> 5254.2390000000005
you pick a music you're stuck

5250.96 --> 5254.2390000000005
to having music

5255.44 --> 5262.159
i don't wanna i want the room i want the

5258.8 --> 5262.159000000001
freedom i want the silence

5263.52 --> 5268.8
except for myself just me talking

5279.52 --> 5286.56
and besides like tibetan monks

5282.719 --> 5287.199
songs it is pretty cool but i don't know

5286.56 --> 5294.96
if i would

5287.199 --> 5296.48
deserve that

5294.96 --> 5298.96
it would i don't know it might feel a

5296.48 --> 5300.799999999999
little pretentious

5298.96 --> 5302.0
i don't want to go there i don't want to

5300.8 --> 5304.639
pretend like i'm

5302.0 --> 5309.84
all special like that and i deserve that

5304.639 --> 5309.84
music or

5314.159 --> 5319.28
no glad to hear that sex sterling i am

5316.639 --> 5322.56
very happy with the intro too

5319.28 --> 5324.8
very happy was a great again a great

5322.56 --> 5326.639
intro

5324.8 --> 5328.2390000000005
made it myself the music was made by

5326.639 --> 5332.0
chris berry

5328.239 --> 5332.5599999999995
uh basically after my instructions and

5332.0 --> 5335.84
he did

5332.56 --> 5338.320000000001
very well was a great great little song

5335.84 --> 5338.32
that he made

5359.6 --> 5365.84
all right back in two minutes

5446.84 --> 5449.84
so

5460.84 --> 5463.84
ever

5472.8 --> 5478.96
hey here we go again

5477.69 --> 5491.839999999999
[Music]

5478.96 --> 5491.84
oh wait you were here before that

5502.84 --> 5505.84
hmm

5544.84 --> 5547.84
hmm

5551.84 --> 5561.84
def leppard i don't know what that is

5554.08 --> 5561.84
but probably music right

5563.12 --> 5565.84
anyway

5570.32 --> 5589.84
yeah anything else you guys i still got

5572.719 --> 5589.84
a half an hour or 25 minutes

5591.76 --> 5603.12
pour some sugar on me what

5595.52 --> 5605.1990000000005
if i've ever been to india no nope

5603.12 --> 5606.32
i've never even been to outside of

5605.199 --> 5610.0
europe except for

5606.32 --> 5613.28
once and as a baby

5610.0 --> 5613.679
went to the united states and outside of

5613.28 --> 5617.84
that

5613.679 --> 5617.84
i've never been outside of europe

5618.88 --> 5627.1990000000005
oh i ever come there i don't know

5622.32 --> 5627.199
i kind of doubt it at this point you

5628.84 --> 5634.08
know

5631.04 --> 5636.159
with the way things are going like if

5634.08 --> 5638.4
i'm going to have to like take vaccines

5636.159 --> 5639.759999999999
or have a vaccine passport to get on a

5638.4 --> 5643.679
plane

5639.76 --> 5648.2390000000005
yeah i'll probably never

5643.679 --> 5654.159
go anywhere outside of europe that way

5648.239 --> 5656.4
so if that nonsense lasts

5654.159 --> 5657.679
if it'll stop someday then who knows

5656.4 --> 5661.04
maybe by that time

5657.679 --> 5662.08
i will go to places but as long as

5661.04 --> 5665.12
airplanes are

5662.08 --> 5666.719
just yeah

5665.12 --> 5668.88
messed up like this with the coveted

5666.719 --> 5669.44
nonsense it's not gonna happen i'm not

5668.88 --> 5671.679
gonna go

5669.44 --> 5674.48
anywhere i'd be lucky to go outside of

5671.679 --> 5674.4800000000005
the netherlands

5683.119 --> 5687.839999999999
so we'll see

5726.84 --> 5732.88
ah

5729.84 --> 5734.0
well once one place i really did wanted

5732.88 --> 5737.92
to go and see

5734.0 --> 5738.719
sometime was new zealand i've seen just

5737.92 --> 5741.28
a lot

5738.719 --> 5743.36
from it from several different angles

5741.28 --> 5745.199
not just like ooh public but people that

5743.36 --> 5747.119
actually go there on vacation i knew

5745.199 --> 5750.799999999999
some of them

5747.119 --> 5753.839999999999
they had just amazing photos and

5750.8 --> 5757.360000000001
that really made me think like oh i

5753.84 --> 5760.88
i would like to see that someday

5757.36 --> 5760.88
it's one of the things that i really

5761.679 --> 5764.96
that really pulls me

5766.88 --> 5770.719
you can still drive and you i have a

5769.679 --> 5772.88
passport

5770.719 --> 5774.4800000000005
it's not about having a passport power

5772.88 --> 5778.719
broda

5774.48 --> 5778.718999999999
it's about not wanting to go on a plane

5781.28 --> 5784.719
if that means that i have to freaking go

5783.199 --> 5786.96
through the covet nonsense

5784.719 --> 5789.36
and even potentially get a vaccine or

5786.96 --> 5789.36
something

5791.6 --> 5795.1990000000005
i have never been on the plane by the

5796.84 --> 5799.84
way

5821.119 --> 5825.5199999999995
right small fraction of business they

5823.04 --> 5827.92
had they still stay in business

5825.52 --> 5829.52
was also probably because of the private

5827.92 --> 5833.1990000000005
airplane

5829.52 --> 5835.6
because of the very extremely rich

5833.199 --> 5836.239
that are keeping the plane companies

5835.6 --> 5841.84
afloat

5836.239 --> 5841.839999999999
i think

5851.199 --> 5855.44
right because i'm not sure but i think

5854.159 --> 5859.44
that

5855.44 --> 5859.759999999999
like public flying will eventually just

5859.44 --> 5863.5199999999995
be

5859.76 --> 5867.6
banned like you can't the only way you

5863.52 --> 5869.52
can fly is through a private plane

5867.6 --> 5871.280000000001
i think they're trying to push for that

5869.52 --> 5874.320000000001
because they've been discouraging

5871.28 --> 5877.5199999999995
public flying capabilities since since

5874.32 --> 5883.84
9 11. it's

5877.52 --> 5883.84
only gotten worse

5919.199 --> 5925.839999999999
it's like just

5936.0 --> 5939.52
every time i freaking hear the word jab

5938.639 --> 5942.32
it almost

5939.52 --> 5943.1990000000005
just makes me aggressive just don't even

5942.32 --> 5945.84
suggest it

5943.199 --> 5946.638999999999
don't put it out there how they want you

5945.84 --> 5951.52
to do it

5946.639 --> 5954.719
don't say it just never do it

5951.52 --> 5957.52
don't even talk about it

5954.719 --> 5957.52
not like that

5962.56 --> 5967.280000000001
that's what they want they want you to

5964.639 --> 5967.6
think it's easy taking a vaccine is just

5967.28 --> 5971.28
like

5967.6 --> 5973.6
taking a supplement pill

5971.28 --> 5974.4
or something that's what they want you

5973.6 --> 5977.92
to think

5974.4 --> 5981.679
never echo that sentiment ever

5977.92 --> 5985.679
never echo it not even sarcastically

5981.679 --> 5986.56
easy facts even go never never even as a

5985.679 --> 5989.3
joke

5986.56 --> 5991.360000000001
that's my recommendation

5989.3 --> 5994.56
[Music]

5991.36 --> 5995.92
people can never think that it is easy

5994.56 --> 5997.92
and that's what they want that's what

5995.92 --> 5999.6
they want everybody to think that's what

5997.92 --> 6002.0
fouchy and bill gates

5999.6 --> 6002.8
wants everyone to think that it's okay

6002.0 --> 6005.84
to just

6002.8 --> 6008.679
take your daily vaccine

6005.84 --> 6012.4800000000005
just easy this so never even

6008.679 --> 6012.4800000000005
sarcastically echo that

6020.84 --> 6025.28
please just you can't joke

6023.199 --> 6027.839999999999
it's like joking about oh all you have

6025.28 --> 6027.84
to do is

6028.239 --> 6032.959999999999
yeah get shot it's not even funny

6031.679 --> 6037.04
sarcastically

6032.96 --> 6040.719
it's just it's just terrible

6037.04 --> 6044.239
that's it the only thing it is

6040.719 --> 6044.88
it's not funny it's not funny as sarcasm

6044.239 --> 6051.36
it is

6044.88 --> 6054.719
just terrible

6051.36 --> 6056.159
yeah the ad these people that are making

6054.719 --> 6065.28
covet ads like this

6056.159 --> 6068.719
i think they should all be sued to hell

6065.28 --> 6071.119
the whole apparatus that is

6068.719 --> 6071.92
playing into this monstrous scam they

6071.119 --> 6075.44
should all be

6071.92 --> 6075.4400000000005
sued to hell

6075.6 --> 6079.52
like literally everything taken from

6078.08 --> 6082.08
them

6079.52 --> 6082.080000000001
everything

6086.159 --> 6092.32
just to give off the sign like yeah

6089.28 --> 6096.4
eugenics an industry of

6092.32 --> 6098.199
death of humanity is not an acceptable

6096.4 --> 6107.839999999999
investment you will be

6098.199 --> 6107.839999999999
severely punished that's what i want

6118.84 --> 6121.84
so

6122.719 --> 6127.52
now nobody's ever seen a virus under a

6124.8 --> 6127.52
microscope

6127.76 --> 6131.92
you can't see a virus under a microscope

6132.4 --> 6136.48
that 3d thing they show you

6136.639 --> 6140.719
is is not necessarily it's not a thing

6139.44 --> 6143.119
it's just

6140.719 --> 6144.2390000000005
they say it's a virus they suggest it

6143.119 --> 6149.839999999999
does all these things

6144.239 --> 6149.839999999999
it doesn't

6152.88 --> 6156.159000000001
like viruses are not invasive they're

6155.76 --> 6158.320000000001
not

6156.159 --> 6160.96
invasion like entities they're not

6158.32 --> 6163.639
parasitical entities

6160.96 --> 6165.52
they're a part of the bottle of the

6163.639 --> 6167.76
microbiology

6165.52 --> 6169.4400000000005
that's it they are just an inherent part

6167.76 --> 6173.52
of the mechanisms

6169.44 --> 6176.5599999999995
on a micro scale everything

6173.52 --> 6180.400000000001
every living thing has its

6176.56 --> 6184.2390000000005
own inherent viruses

6180.4 --> 6191.839999999999
it's there it's part of the mechanism

6184.239 --> 6191.839999999999
it's not an invasive force

6192.41 --> 6195.54
[Music]

6209.97 --> 6213.149
[Music]

6216.0 --> 6221.36
oh you think that's [ __ ] no no no

6218.08 --> 6225.04
that actually does happen

6221.36 --> 6227.119
people that die get certified covet

6225.04 --> 6228.8
death even if it has nothing to do with

6227.119 --> 6231.36
it

6228.8 --> 6232.56
it happens you know why because they get

6231.36 --> 6235.759999999999
paid

6232.56 --> 6238.080000000001
huge amounts to do that

6235.76 --> 6239.679
specifically it happens it has been

6238.08 --> 6243.119
registered to happen

6239.679 --> 6247.84
officially reported to happen

6243.119 --> 6247.839999999999
it happens

6250.639 --> 6255.679
who pays the pharmaceutical companies

6258.48 --> 6275.839999999999
the whole operation that's driving the

6262.8 --> 6275.84
covet [ __ ] that they pay

6286.0 --> 6290.56
you could do it yourself if you really

6288.639 --> 6292.719
wanted what the [ __ ] are you blabbering

6290.56 --> 6295.6
about you idiot

6292.719 --> 6295.6
let's admit it

6296.0 --> 6300.56
it's like people in the professions have

6300.84 --> 6305.52
testified

6302.4 --> 6309.839999999999
very widely that it does

6305.52 --> 6312.639
happen and you can even mention specific

6309.84 --> 6313.1990000000005
people sometimes like family members

6312.639 --> 6315.84
that

6313.199 --> 6317.759999999999
they know exactly what they had what

6315.84 --> 6319.04
they died off and then guess what they

6317.76 --> 6330.400000000001
were certified

6319.04 --> 6333.5199999999995
cove it so yes it does happen

6330.4 --> 6334.4
oh peer-reviewed studies bill here we go

6333.52 --> 6338.719
again here we

6334.4 --> 6338.719
we have another pseudo-scientist idiot

6339.199 --> 6342.08
smallpox

6343.76 --> 6349.04
i don't know what smallpox is i had

6346.239 --> 6349.04
smallpox

6349.44 --> 6355.919999999999
it's not a virus though because viruses

6352.48 --> 6359.599999999999
don't exist they don't do what is said

6355.92 --> 6362.8
is done it doesn't work that way

6359.6 --> 6373.84
all the viruses it does not work

6362.8 --> 6373.84
that way

6386.0 --> 6388.88
uh no

6389.199 --> 6393.759999999999
viruses do not exist idiot

6394.56 --> 6398.4800000000005
there's no proof there's no scientific

6396.56 --> 6399.4400000000005
proof for viruses there's scientific

6398.48 --> 6402.48
proof

6399.44 --> 6403.919999999999
for bacteria for parasites all kinds of

6402.48 --> 6407.599999999999
things but viruses

6403.92 --> 6410.56
as they say the model for that just like

6407.6 --> 6412.8
a micro bacteria a non-living micro

6410.56 --> 6413.52
bacteria that invades the body and does

6412.8 --> 6416.4800000000005
all that

6413.52 --> 6417.360000000001
no there is no scientific evidence for

6416.48 --> 6420.08
this

6417.36 --> 6420.08
there is none

6422.719 --> 6427.199
just a bunch of peer review [ __ ]

6425.04 --> 6428.719
it's a conspiracy it's a medical

6427.199 --> 6431.599999999999
conspiracy

6428.719 --> 6432.56
as a control mechanism it's a grappler

6431.6 --> 6436.56
system

6432.56 --> 6439.76
a mind control medical mechanism

6436.56 --> 6441.360000000001
to take control of people through an

6439.76 --> 6445.1990000000005
invisible enemy

6441.36 --> 6446.159
that they don't understand and made very

6445.199 --> 6448.638999999999
afraid of

6446.159 --> 6451.04
that's what viruses are that's what

6448.639 --> 6453.4400000000005
they've have been sort of you they've

6451.04 --> 6455.76
before just been used for profit now

6453.44 --> 6458.239
they're being used to take over the

6455.76 --> 6461.679
freaking world

6458.239 --> 6464.799999999999
and they don't exist it's a pure

6461.679 --> 6471.84
mind control mechanism

6464.8 --> 6471.84
viruses don't work that way

6504.239 --> 6511.759999999999
right yeah indeed hiding under the

6508.639 --> 6512.08
school desk during the cold war isn't

6511.76 --> 6515.119000000001
that

6512.08 --> 6519.28
interesting how nukes don't exist

6515.119 --> 6522.96
either huh yeah there's another one

6519.28 --> 6526.32
it's a military industrial complex based

6522.96 --> 6528.56
mind control scam

6526.32 --> 6531.04
there's a lot of those there's a lot of

6528.56 --> 6533.679
it a lot of it in the world

6531.04 --> 6534.96
most issues you've been made very afraid

6533.679 --> 6537.36
of throughout your life

6534.96 --> 6538.2390000000005
that you've been made to perceive as a

6537.36 --> 6540.96
long-term

6538.239 --> 6541.5199999999995
threat for humanity guess what most of

6540.96 --> 6545.76
it is

6541.52 --> 6549.119000000001
complete made up horse [ __ ]

6545.76 --> 6552.639
yeah think about that every

6549.119 --> 6555.759999999999
major long-term threat to humanity

6552.639 --> 6558.96
from technology or the outside or

6555.76 --> 6561.360000000001
meet yours it's all made up horse

6558.96 --> 6561.36
[ __ ]

6563.599 --> 6566.719
doesn't mean there aren't any real

6565.04 --> 6569.119
problems

6566.719 --> 6571.76
but those things they're all made up

6569.119 --> 6571.759999999999
[ __ ]

6573.64 --> 6576.789000000001
[Music]

6578.0 --> 6582.0
oh here we go again uh no i haven't

6580.88 --> 6585.36
directly noticed

6582.0 --> 6588.08
that but the nurses refusing to fax

6585.36 --> 6588.48
but that's great good to hear i hope

6588.08 --> 6590.5599999999995
they

6588.48 --> 6592.32
they keep it that way because the

6590.56 --> 6595.280000000001
government here is being just

6592.32 --> 6596.159
horrifically pushy but people's patients

6595.28 --> 6599.36
are running thin

6596.159 --> 6601.598999999999
at the same time i think over here the

6599.36 --> 6603.04
people's patients are running thin more

6601.599 --> 6605.63
even than on average

6603.04 --> 6608.4
in other countries which is a good sign

6605.63 --> 6611.599
[Music]

6608.4 --> 6613.759999999999
so i i hope the resistance against the

6611.599 --> 6617.76
covet nonsense

6613.76 --> 6618.56
keeps up so the government doesn't have

6617.76 --> 6622.8
a chance to

6618.56 --> 6622.8
actually push it through and make it

6622.84 --> 6639.4400000000005
permanent

6624.4 --> 6641.679
but it's a tough one

6639.44 --> 6641.678999999999
hmm

6650.84 --> 6653.84
right

6656.56 --> 6663.52
all right kovit is all a scam it's all

6660.159 --> 6665.839999999999
a scam all of it there's

6663.52 --> 6667.1990000000005
literally nothing going on oh yeah

6665.84 --> 6669.92
people do get sick they get

6667.199 --> 6670.4
cold they get a flu guess what is always

6669.92 --> 6673.119
there

6670.4 --> 6674.4
it always has been nothing from the

6673.119 --> 6677.04
medical industry

6674.4 --> 6677.92
has ever been able to stop that from

6677.04 --> 6680.4
happening

6677.92 --> 6682.0
it's just a bunch of helping against the

6680.4 --> 6684.719
symptoms which is what it

6682.0 --> 6686.96
always has been and the only thing you

6684.719 --> 6690.08
can really do against it

6686.96 --> 6692.84
because it it's not even

6690.08 --> 6694.719
yeah it's not like a bacterial infection

6692.84 --> 6698.4800000000005
situation

6694.719 --> 6701.28
with the flu or the flu little maybe

6698.48 --> 6703.678999999999
it's complicated it's like a real flu

6701.28 --> 6706.8
bacteria or whatever

6703.679 --> 6708.88
is it even bacteria but with the cold

6706.8 --> 6710.88
this lit it's

6708.88 --> 6713.679
people just get cold not because they're

6710.88 --> 6716.159000000001
getting invaded by something it's

6713.679 --> 6716.159
because

6717.04 --> 6720.96
their body just needs to clean up and

6718.88 --> 6723.1990000000005
they get a signal from the outside it's

6720.96 --> 6724.719
triggered psychosomatically and then the

6723.199 --> 6727.839999999999
body decides wait

6724.719 --> 6730.4800000000005
we've got a lot of junk piled up on the

6727.84 --> 6732.400000000001
cellular level let's take this

6730.48 --> 6734.839999999999
opportunity to get rid of it

6732.4 --> 6736.0
and then you become sick because the

6734.84 --> 6738.8
sickness

6736.0 --> 6740.08
is the symptoms of your body cleaning up

6738.8 --> 6742.2390000000005
all that junk

6740.08 --> 6743.36
and that cleaning up of all that junk

6742.239 --> 6746.799999999999
that is what the

6743.36 --> 6748.48
actual virus elements do

6746.8 --> 6750.400000000001
that's the actual thing they're doing

6748.48 --> 6751.678999999999
they're the cleanup crew they clean it

6750.4 --> 6755.44
up

6751.679 --> 6759.1990000000005
they're summoned from within the body

6755.44 --> 6760.96
to start cleaning up the toxins on a

6759.199 --> 6764.638999999999
cellular level

6760.96 --> 6768.56
that's what they do

6764.639 --> 6772.639
it's not a an infectious disease

6768.56 --> 6772.639
it isn't never was

6773.28 --> 6778.32
but it is often psychosomatically

6776.84 --> 6781.52
triggered

6778.32 --> 6784.08
if you are if you are with your body in

6781.52 --> 6785.76
a state where your body can kind of use

6784.08 --> 6787.84
that clean up process

6785.76 --> 6790.88
and you are in the vicinity of people

6787.84 --> 6793.119000000001
that are in the middle of being sick

6790.88 --> 6794.2390000000005
sneeze a lot and all that then it

6793.119 --> 6797.44
becomes

6794.239 --> 6800.48
very more likely

6797.44 --> 6802.638999999999
this is not always the case it's also a

6800.48 --> 6805.04
lot about mindset that your body will

6802.639 --> 6809.679
also start to take that signal

6805.04 --> 6813.119
and decide decide

6809.679 --> 6815.92
not get infected decide

6813.119 --> 6817.92
to get sick you understand it's a

6815.92 --> 6821.36
decision

6817.92 --> 6824.0
made by the subconscious and the body

6821.36 --> 6824.719
it's not an infection it's a decision

6824.0 --> 6826.88
you see

6824.719 --> 6828.0
the symptoms and then your body's like

6826.88 --> 6831.28
oh

6828.0 --> 6832.239
maybe we should do that too because

6831.28 --> 6834.4
getting sick

6832.239 --> 6836.0
is actually good for you it cleans up

6834.4 --> 6838.719
your body afterward

6836.0 --> 6838.719
most people

6839.36 --> 6846.08
can testify to this that

6842.639 --> 6847.92
after you've you're done being sick

6846.08 --> 6849.44
you have a period if you don't just

6847.92 --> 6852.4800000000005
start taking all kinds of junk

6849.44 --> 6855.36
drugs and [ __ ] all the time like

6852.48 --> 6856.5599999999995
pharmaceutical crap painkillers or

6855.36 --> 6859.28
whatever or psycho

6856.56 --> 6859.679
yeah whatever antidepressant if you're

6859.28 --> 6862.5599999999995
just

6859.679 --> 6864.639
relatively clean then after you've

6862.56 --> 6867.679
restored from being sick

6864.639 --> 6872.0
you are very much more likely

6867.679 --> 6874.08
to feel a lot healthier and clearer

6872.0 --> 6875.44
than you did before you got sick you

6874.08 --> 6879.04
know why

6875.44 --> 6882.32
because yeah that cold that my light flu

6879.04 --> 6885.28
all these things it cleans up your body

6882.32 --> 6886.48
from toxins that's what it is that is

6885.28 --> 6888.639
what it is

6886.48 --> 6889.598999999999
it's not an infectious disease it's a

6888.639 --> 6892.96
metabolic

6889.599 --> 6897.4400000000005
clean up process it cleans you

6892.96 --> 6897.44
up so when it's done you're cleaned up

6899.83 --> 6904.479
[Music]

6908.22 --> 6915.84
[Music]

6912.32 --> 6918.96
yeah yeah old people die well career

6915.84 --> 6933.84
list it's what happens

6918.96 --> 6933.84
old people die

6944.56 --> 6947.76
so do you think that because old people

6947.36 --> 6950.88
die

6947.76 --> 6953.119000000001
sometimes from a bad cold

6950.88 --> 6954.88
you think that all of this [ __ ] is

6953.119 --> 6958.159
all justified now

6954.88 --> 6960.400000000001
because of that if

6958.159 --> 6962.32
you think that old people dying from

6960.4 --> 6966.08
colds justifies the

6962.32 --> 6969.84
corona crap that has been happening

6966.08 --> 6969.84
do you really think that's worth it

6972.56 --> 6976.159000000001
if you do then you are completely out of

6974.8 --> 6979.4400000000005
your mind

6976.159 --> 6981.679
or you're an old vampire they'll

6979.44 --> 6983.919999999999
rather sacrifice the entire world than

6981.679 --> 6989.84
have some virtual threat
