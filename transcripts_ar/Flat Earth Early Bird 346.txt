[Music]

32.119 --> 34.18
you

42.68 --> 44.74
you

46.34 --> 55.230000000000004
good morning welcome to flatter the

50.76 --> 57.54
earlybird numbered 346 I'm your host

55.23 --> 60.0
Arwen miss before we start the show

57.54 --> 62.94
please don't forget to share it on any

60.0 --> 64.41
platform you deem fit and also if you

62.94 --> 66.24
haven't already subscribed to my channel

64.41 --> 67.71
and hit the bell notification so you

66.24 --> 69.96
know when I'm going live which is

67.71 --> 70.22
normally 2:00 p.m. Amsterdam time every

69.96 --> 73.91999999999999
day

70.22 --> 77.25
please also do support my channel and my

73.92 --> 78.99000000000001
show through the paypal patreon my

77.25 --> 86.52
GoFundMe and the super chats that would

78.99 --> 90.57
be much appreciated so yeah today it

86.52 --> 93.81
feels like winter set in it's still

90.57 --> 97.64899999999999
pretty beautiful bright no chemtrails

93.81 --> 104.88
that I could spot and the air is

97.649 --> 107.49
incredibly dry also so yeah there was

104.88 --> 111.39
actually ice on the roof this morning

107.49 --> 117.8
and I went to bed really early really

111.39 --> 121.369
early before 12 o'clock even I think and

117.8 --> 125.13
so I yeah I get more daylight that way

121.369 --> 126.81
because I do really appreciate it taking

125.13 --> 132.48
some of this Sun even though it is a lot

126.81 --> 137.86
more cold now and dry hmm so yeah I have

132.48 --> 140.88899999999998
Tamera coffee with me today and tea

137.86 --> 140.889
[Music]

144.54 --> 156.73
it was just yeah just casually watching

153.359 --> 162.84900000000002
parliamentary debate of England I don't

156.73 --> 164.82899999999998
know I caught on to that and yeah I get

162.849 --> 166.89999999999998
live notifications it's just like is

164.829 --> 170.95000000000002
stuff going down there right now it's

166.9 --> 174.939
it's mostly political typical weird

170.95 --> 176.82899999999998
stuff but yeah I don't know it's just

174.939 --> 178.32899999999998
for the same reason I sometimes still

176.829 --> 181.09
watch the news I even caught myself

178.329 --> 184.389
today watching a CNN clip now that is

181.09 --> 189.81900000000002
rare that it actually you voluntarily

184.389 --> 193.0
watch that but it was Obama made was

189.819 --> 197.85899999999998
basically addressing social justice

193.0 --> 201.129
warriors to stop being so obsessed over

197.859 --> 205.69
the over the semantics and get to action

201.129 --> 209.42999999999998
like it was just one of those little

205.69 --> 213.19
conundrums it's yeah so I was really

209.43 --> 216.15900000000002
surprised to see that yeah so I've been

213.19 --> 218.409
scouring around usually as I do and it's

216.159 --> 220.54
rare that I bump into some kind of

218.409 --> 223.78
subject news related that I would bring

220.54 --> 227.439
up even though there's a lot of

223.78 --> 229.769
remarkable things going on and repulsive

227.439 --> 229.769
things

235.09 --> 243.94
anyway that I'm not gonna voluntarily

238.599 --> 247.98899999999998
bring up yeah being a bit quiet I was

243.94 --> 258.9
quiet my volume was reset I hope I fixed

247.989 --> 262.56
it put it it's ten it should be enough

258.9 --> 266.54999999999995
see if I put it to 11

262.56 --> 266.55
okay maybe this is better

275.82 --> 280.67
now this this should be fine right

284.01 --> 291.65
I don't know what's going on it's

291.88 --> 294.78
that's weird

298.8 --> 305.03000000000003
let me see maybe there's something wrong

310.069 --> 321.24
no should I'll be working just don't

315.539 --> 328.83
know why the volume is so low even

321.24 --> 331.31
though I said it to 11 now I can't

328.83 --> 331.31
explain it

338.8 --> 345.74
[Music]

341.05 --> 350.2
alright alright good so anyway yeah that

345.74 --> 359.87
happened and yeah Nathan Oakley had a

350.2 --> 363.2
interview with with Roxanne and and the

359.87 --> 366.37
other guy it was but it was really good

363.2 --> 370.07
detailed like about all the fallacies

366.37 --> 371.84000000000003
put it down really really good so if you

370.07 --> 376.79
haven't seen that yet definitely

371.84 --> 379.82
recommend you watch it yeah let's go

376.79 --> 382.36
through check I forgot Nathan was in

379.82 --> 382.36
there by the way

385.82 --> 395.65999999999997
right so HM was first Samus trigger

392.21 --> 404.89
troll secret Asian man Crockett family

395.66 --> 412.22
farms we granny us to look tell us Tao

404.89 --> 416.97999999999996
Asteria wish you got an easier name path

412.22 --> 416.98
secret Asian man Eagle played an anchor

417.97 --> 431.0
mark colored requiem dream Jeff Johnson

426.43 --> 433.69
flat soy de Obama called Julia Pavan was

431.0 --> 433.69
her Saleem

437.3 --> 446.31
gotta kill the hope there's an oak leaf

440.19 --> 454.91
or see Oh Amanda you such a long chat I

446.31 --> 454.91
might be doubling some of you the eye

457.56 --> 467.73
goodtimz for all kinda koala carts Rambo

462.57 --> 479.43
Jambo Hilton pop George Sanford doc

467.73 --> 481.83000000000004
Michael yeah gotcha it's great win it at

479.43 --> 485.0
the last moment just skips a whole part

481.83 --> 489.10999999999996
especially when a lot of people come in

485.0 --> 501.63
sorry - sorry - sadita Cosentino

489.11 --> 506.13
flatlander yeah so yeah I'm pretty much

501.63 --> 510.63
a bit of a blank slate maybe it's the

506.13 --> 513.45
weather but yeah been managing to

510.63 --> 516.18
restore some of my diet getting it's

513.45 --> 518.76
also noticeable that it apparently with

516.18 --> 524.6899999999999
this cold coming in I am more hungry and

518.76 --> 529.28
then just getting more fats very typical

524.69 --> 534.7700000000001
so I'm just following my nature and

529.28 --> 534.77
stalking up my physique for the winter

536.3 --> 539.9
still doing great

543.38 --> 551.52
right yeah I I sporadically addressed so

547.71 --> 553.98
many different issues it's almost like

551.52 --> 556.65
if I'd had to get them all back I just

553.98 --> 561.54
had to rewatch the whole episode from

556.65 --> 564.29
yesterday and I have it as I said I

561.54 --> 566.9399999999999
don't rewatch everything all the time

564.29 --> 570.5999999999999
especially when I had a lot of silent

566.94 --> 579.45
moments that just annoys me a lot

570.6 --> 583.5600000000001
oh god no bugs yeah yeah you know my

579.45 --> 589.13
policy for bugs is the same as for most

583.56 --> 589.13
entities on any level that is you just

590.51 --> 598.71
try to find some common ground and yeah

595.98 --> 601.5600000000001
you can potentially get some kind of

598.71 --> 605.3100000000001
friendship or collaboration or whatever

601.56 --> 607.4899999999999
out of it and that's it that should be

605.31 --> 607.4899999999999
it

610.76 --> 614.06
alo dank

628.829 --> 634.949
what does a gas particle look like well

632.97 --> 638.7900000000001
that's the funny thing about it it

634.949 --> 641.3389999999999
doesn't look like anything because when

638.79 --> 644.189
you say look you're implying visual and

641.339 --> 649.7090000000001
one of the typical traits about gases is

644.189 --> 652.769
that they are invisible so only you can

649.709 --> 656.2389999999999
only start to notice them when you have

652.769 --> 659.639
vast vast quantities of them and then

656.239 --> 662.73
you look through it then there is some

659.639 --> 668.6
effect to the different gases but that's

662.73 --> 672.6
the only way you see it I think well I

668.6 --> 673.0400000000001
think all gases are transparent aren't

672.6 --> 675.119
they

673.04 --> 678.149
because when they're not there we rather

675.119 --> 681.2900000000001
like particulates so pieces of solid

678.149 --> 681.29
matter just floating around

690.47 --> 696.6600000000001
but anyway I kind of red-herring

693.95 --> 698.46
your question with a good point that's

696.66 --> 700.8
always the way to do it if you're gonna

698.46 --> 705.36
be a red herring salesman then present

700.8 --> 706.5
one hell of a fish you know but what

705.36 --> 709.95
does it look like

706.5 --> 715.74
well it's conceptualized to be this very

709.95 --> 719.0300000000001
specific unit that randomly bounces

715.74 --> 723.86
around against all other things and that

719.03 --> 729.47
well that's the thing that it works

723.86 --> 733.13
whenever I deal with it it's technically

729.47 --> 737.07
closed says it's like it works

733.13 --> 745.11
technically but is it really what that

737.07 --> 748.7700000000001
is that has been my question and I try

745.11 --> 752.58
to approach it more dynamically what can

748.77 --> 755.31
it really be and like if gas expands

752.58 --> 760.4100000000001
within available space right it

755.31 --> 763.25
literally expands and is it more apart

760.41 --> 765.63
doing that isn't there some kind of

763.25 --> 770.94
technical consequence is there proof

765.63 --> 773.55
that really exactly like I know about

770.94 --> 780.36
how it works out so well when you

773.55 --> 783.93
compare Escape surface versus containers

780.36 --> 786.57
then that random factor works out so

783.93 --> 788.55
well to explain it but that seems to be

786.57 --> 792.63
the only thing that really ties that

788.55 --> 797.42
element down but could it be that just

792.63 --> 799.65
the particles do like take up more space

797.42 --> 803.889
because they're being stretched apart

799.65 --> 807.309
and they still don't become viv

803.889 --> 810.519
yeah visible but that they could be

807.309 --> 814.329
technically that the molecule could be

810.519 --> 818.799
stretched up as it were and then as soon

814.329 --> 820.6289999999999
as yeah it would find some kind of point

818.799 --> 826.54
it could escape to the it would size

820.629 --> 834.22
down again so that its actual size could

826.54 --> 837.519
be more dynamic and not so set thank you

834.22 --> 843.089
only Schiphol can see how much is a

837.519 --> 843.089
castle also check oh jesus my god

843.91 --> 853.919
yeah croissant it's it's 2 euros

849.609 --> 857.4100000000001
basically but I got the yeah they

853.919 --> 860.819
they're delivered in a specific moment

857.41 --> 865.779
so this time I didn't I was too early

860.819 --> 869.399
when going for groceries wow thanks man

865.779 --> 869.399
I will to check it

872.74 --> 879.649
not take too long so but yeah that's

876.559 --> 886.66
just one of the things I totally get

879.649 --> 890.3
people you know I totally get people's

886.66 --> 894.829
doubts about specific elements within

890.3 --> 901.16
the explanation of what things are it's

894.829 --> 903.1389999999999
a good doubt it's it's literally your

901.16 --> 907.49
sense is trying to make sense of things

903.139 --> 909.11
and if there's something odd about the

907.49 --> 913.639
information or something left

909.11 --> 916.5500000000001
unexplained in a way then that yeah that

913.639 --> 918.41
it's a way at the foundation of it all

916.55 --> 920.4799999999999
and that takes away some of the trust

918.41 --> 923.5889999999999
you feel you can put into it I totally

920.48 --> 927.41
get that that's that's actually natural

923.589 --> 929.629
but yeah what can you do well try to

927.41 --> 932.079
find an alternative explanation that is

929.629 --> 934.85
what also science is about eventually

932.079 --> 940.0089999999999
you try to find an alternative route and

934.85 --> 943.1890000000001
then you try to compare it based on as

940.009 --> 946.249
much scientific valid validated evidence

943.189 --> 950.5999999999999
and empirical and next your experiment

946.249 --> 954.769
will be good and then see if that works

950.6 --> 958.0690000000001
and then the consequences comparing it

954.769 --> 959.779
to the older approaches that's

958.069 --> 962.149
technically what we've been doing

959.779 --> 967.579
concerning gravity that's how relative

962.149 --> 972.709
densities just absolutely replaced all

967.579 --> 974.4799999999999
of the necessities of gravity so that's

972.709 --> 976.699
what we've been doing with that and that

974.48 --> 981.259
they're made there's more things out

976.699 --> 984.2589999999999
there to be looked at carefully and

981.259 --> 987.8290000000001
refined it could be things that are

984.259 --> 990.769
eluding us because hey if you have these

987.829 --> 993.2589999999999
unique approaches to things like

990.769 --> 996.35
discoveries you could make and you just

993.259 --> 999.439
change some of the informations about it

996.35 --> 1002.6990000000001
and make it more uniform slide it more

999.439 --> 1005.0699999999999
into a specific uniform pattern that

1002.699 --> 1009.12
will make it more

1005.07 --> 1012.5500000000001
easily graspable for the yeah the

1009.12 --> 1015.46
simpler minded and more appealable that

1012.55 --> 1018.87
way so they will keep it that way while

1015.46 --> 1022.77
at the same time you could hide very

1018.87 --> 1026.699
potential things that could be done by

1022.77 --> 1029.92
oversimplifying things so they can hide

1026.699 --> 1033.699
little tricks within the discoveries as

1029.92 --> 1037.42
it were so that is also part of the

1033.699 --> 1041.439
reason for me I'm just looking around at

1037.42 --> 1045.069
the details trying to work through where

1041.439 --> 1047.41
there is room to work with and see what

1045.069 --> 1049.62
gems pop off that's really what it's

1047.41 --> 1049.6200000000001
like

1053.58 --> 1061.0
like excavation anyway thank you so much

1058.72 --> 1063.07
only Shiva can see for the for the

1061.0 --> 1068.83
paypal and the super chat donations

1063.07 --> 1078.97
thank you so much I'll definitely get a

1068.83 --> 1086.71
Illuminati Castle tomorrow thanks but

1078.97 --> 1091.8700000000001
yeah there's a lot of issues about gas

1086.71 --> 1097.39
and what it actually is but the overall

1091.87 --> 1099.04
behaviors of it are pretty clear even

1097.39 --> 1104.3500000000001
though we don't understand

1099.04 --> 1107.7
the actual core element perfectly right

1104.35 --> 1107.6999999999998
I guess I could say that

1116.57 --> 1119.78
[Music]

1133.13 --> 1136.2890000000002
[Music]

1141.72 --> 1151.669
are you rambling on about right yeah

1152.84 --> 1158.539
yeah but that's a funny thing that the

1155.87 --> 1164.029
pressure the pressure technically a

1158.539 --> 1167.09
derivative something you derive and it's

1164.029 --> 1169.909
very attainable but it doesn't explain

1167.09 --> 1173.36
anything but directly about the nature

1169.909 --> 1178.279
of what it is only what it behaves like

1173.36 --> 1184.0089999999998
it tells that it spreads out to find

1178.279 --> 1185.69
equal pressure inside the container but

1184.009 --> 1189.94
it doesn't say actually about the

1185.69 --> 1189.94
fundamental particle anything that's Z

1212.66 --> 1215.2900000000002
yeah

1215.55 --> 1229.19
yeah alright L&D his friend's dad lost

1226.47 --> 1229.19
space

1232.37 --> 1242.29
I think what he meant to say was his

1238.46 --> 1244.73
friend's dad told his friend and

1242.29 --> 1247.07
probably a lot of other people that he

1244.73 --> 1251.09
went to space and then his friend

1247.07 --> 1254.8
believed him and then he believed his

1251.09 --> 1254.8
friend and his friends dead

1255.16 --> 1259.0790000000002
[Music]

1266.88 --> 1271.44
no it is it is septembe

1274.39 --> 1283.96
and then after the gases have filled the

1280.24 --> 1288.99
space that's when suddenly things are

1283.96 --> 1292.75
subjected to the natural state and well

1288.99 --> 1296.77
the more dense things go to the bottom

1292.75 --> 1299.71
that whatever has been carried along or

1296.77 --> 1302.2
even just the some of the gases that may

1299.71 --> 1306.429
be more dense they will try to start to

1302.2 --> 1309.88
settle lower to equalize the densities

1306.429 --> 1318.91
and as all that happens a gradient will

1309.88 --> 1323.65
start to set in because the gas has

1318.91 --> 1325.51
filled the space and then all the gases

1323.65 --> 1328.99
that are present will start to follow

1325.51 --> 1332.32
the natural order of things and follow

1328.99 --> 1334.33
relative density and hey if it was a

1332.32 --> 1337.84
dynamic system if there was some

1334.33 --> 1341.35
changing heat source then it would start

1337.84 --> 1343.32
to resemble it a little bit more to how

1341.35 --> 1346.4499999999998
the atmosphere would be you know in

1343.32 --> 1349.6299999999999
homogeneous dynamic system because it's

1346.45 --> 1355.059
constantly moving around so the gases in

1349.63 --> 1357.8200000000002
our atmosphere have much less yeah the

1355.059 --> 1360.55
ability to settle because everything's

1357.82 --> 1362.6699999999998
moving around so it I'll stay mix in a

1360.55 --> 1362.6699999999998
way

1372.47 --> 1379.04
right now but we wouldn't all suffocate

1375.44 --> 1385.99
in co2 because there's not that much co2

1379.04 --> 1389.06
around and hey it nature depends on co2

1385.99 --> 1393.53
settling at the bottom because yeah

1389.06 --> 1402.6799999999998
trees and plants absorb all that so no

1393.53 --> 1404.84
it's not a problem it's yeah even if it

1402.68 --> 1407.99
would settle it'll all just be vacuumed

1404.84 --> 1414.61
off by the plants and then absorbed and

1407.99 --> 1414.61
change into oxygen and glucose

1418.94 --> 1425.979
if there's enough water around

1422.9 --> 1425.979
[Music]

1439.02 --> 1454.85
yes doc Michael that's true things can

1448.02 --> 1459.02
be yeahthere's most materials have

1454.85 --> 1459.02
several states including gas

1466.59 --> 1474.629
but still doesn't reveal the nature of

1470.309 --> 1479.84
the actual gas particle form as it were

1474.629 --> 1479.84
as it is assumed that's other things

1488.95 --> 1495.3400000000001
yeah but cept a pea yeah I understand

1492.43 --> 1499.14
that's what you were responding to but

1495.34 --> 1501.25
they also explained that in a separated

1499.14 --> 1504.2700000000002
experimental container where you would

1501.25 --> 1507.49
do that it's not a dynamic system

1504.27 --> 1513.79
everything is allowed to settle in

1507.49 --> 1516.82
quietness and then yes maybe a layer of

1513.79 --> 1520.72
co2 would eventually settle given enough

1516.82 --> 1522.28
time and without any interruption or

1520.72 --> 1524.65
vibration or anything anything that

1522.28 --> 1527.71
would change what is going on inside of

1524.65 --> 1534.75
that container but that's not what the

1527.71 --> 1534.75
earth is like just saying

1535.87 --> 1539.02
[Music]

1545.33 --> 1553.6999999999998
well yeah shifted purple what are they

1548.88 --> 1553.7
well they're light stars are light

1558.68 --> 1563.73
everything in this realm is able to see

1562.32 --> 1572.1599999999999
them as long as there's nothing

1563.73 --> 1576.23
obstructing it within a certain reach

1572.16 --> 1576.23
that that is the weirdest thing about it

1590.44 --> 1596.53
yeah and also considering yeah it is

1593.5 --> 1599.91
light it is some kind of energy since

1596.53 --> 1604.8999999999999
there seems to I can't find any local

1599.91 --> 1607.8000000000002
localized source to it to its nature I'd

1604.9 --> 1610.3600000000001
have to say that whatever is causing it

1607.8 --> 1613.06
or whatever wherever the energy is

1610.36 --> 1619.6
coming from is just ever-present in the

1613.06 --> 1621.73
realm and then yeah my imagination in

1619.6 --> 1624.4299999999998
this case because this doesn't really

1621.73 --> 1626.65
touch scientific ground but it starts to

1624.43 --> 1631.96
dwell upon the conceptualization of the

1626.65 --> 1635.13
ether energy field being present so if

1631.96 --> 1638.02
that is all present and yeah there's

1635.13 --> 1641.38
relations to that that holds some ground

1638.02 --> 1645.25
well maybe these lights are then caused

1641.38 --> 1650.5300000000002
by it somehow maybe building as part of

1645.25 --> 1652.6
the design it's kind of the baseline

1650.53 --> 1655.3799999999999
assumption that I've been going from

1652.6 --> 1655.3799999999999
from the start

1659.929 --> 1665.76
even though yeah that's just yeah how do

1662.94 --> 1668.01
you prove any of it it's just with the

1665.76 --> 1683.76
lack of proof of another direction this

1668.01 --> 1690.09
is just what remains for me so yeah so

1683.76 --> 1693.769
anything relevant if you got more

1690.09 --> 1693.769
questions it's always welcome

1706.47 --> 1709.159
that

1714.08 --> 1724.85
oh really that is bose-einstein

1718.54 --> 1727.07
condensate is what is that these are

1724.85 --> 1736.7199999999998
those supposed to be states beyond

1727.07 --> 1740.03
plasma Philip Cooper and I've heard I

1736.72 --> 1741.8600000000001
didn't I know the quark concepts I've

1740.03 --> 1744.47
heard of gluons being mentioned

1741.86 --> 1748.85
especially in Star Trek and I've heard

1744.47 --> 1751.3700000000001
the terminology bose-einstein condensate

1748.85 --> 1755.4499999999998
but I don't know what that technically

1751.37 --> 1758.3799999999999
is or what it's supposed to be

1755.45 --> 1758.38
representing

1775.68 --> 1780.77
it's very funny George Sanford

1793.79 --> 1798.45
[Music]

1805.76 --> 1808.36
what

1816.62 --> 1824.1789999999999
okay so they've been probably just been

1819.759 --> 1826.279
fooling around with plasma amping up the

1824.179 --> 1829.009
energies and trying to make something

1826.279 --> 1833.169
else out of it trying to find the next

1829.009 --> 1833.169
level of the plasma state or something

1835.419 --> 1841.48
don't know why that has any serious

1837.799 --> 1841.48
relevance to anything but

1849.99 --> 1853.049
[Music]

1856.65 --> 1863.8700000000001
I think that technically plasma is

1860.37 --> 1863.87
already weird enough on its own

1869.08 --> 1875.71
it's like out I am I'm just being a

1874.0 --> 1877.75
little ignorant concerning it I've never

1875.71 --> 1881.04
really looked too much into that stuff

1877.75 --> 1885.42
but like how do they even make plasma

1881.04 --> 1889.03
like it's not a normal state of matter

1885.42 --> 1893.64
so do they like electrified gasses or

1889.03 --> 1898.68
something subjected to extreme magnetism

1893.64 --> 1901.39
and or they keep it in in a broken state

1898.68 --> 1905.5
but with what did they do that

1901.39 --> 1908.5300000000002
like gases is it like that like a

1905.5 --> 1911.44
chamber full of gas and then just giant

1908.53 --> 1914.68
amount of electricity or whatever on to

1911.44 --> 1916.65
it and then it within that frame it has

1914.68 --> 1920.24
changed the plasma is that what they do

1916.65 --> 1925.43
to create that roughly

1920.24 --> 1925.43
[Music]

1932.39 --> 1950.76
yeah I just wonder if you know is plasma

1942.81 --> 1953.73
even natural is there even proof of

1950.76 --> 1955.77
plasma being present in the realm

1953.73 --> 1958.43
naturally without being created by

1955.77 --> 1958.43
people

1967.789 --> 1973.679
I can't think of a thing that wouldn't

1971.13 --> 1979.0700000000002
lie within a in the realm of

1973.679 --> 1984.3600000000001
presupposition as to lightning storms

1979.07 --> 1987.1789999999999
but where's the actual proof of the

1984.36 --> 1990.6299999999999
plasma then because plasma disintegrates

1987.179 --> 1999.63
it collapses again back into it normal

1990.63 --> 2001.7890000000002
matter right so I I could yeah it makes

1999.63 --> 2007.22
sense to me that the lightning is

2001.789 --> 2009.679
actually just the electrified mater the

2007.22 --> 2013.3990000000001
gas there that might be turned into

2009.679 --> 2016.029
plastic and plastic plasma and then

2013.399 --> 2018.889
electrified starts to radiate like that

2016.029 --> 2021.049
for just a short moment but as soon as

2018.889 --> 2027.86
the electricity is gone so it's the

2021.049 --> 2030.289
plasma so there's no remains of it so

2027.86 --> 2032.6589999999999
the plasma seems to be rather secondary

2030.289 --> 2035.26
there's no permanent plasma state

2032.659 --> 2035.2600000000002
anywhere

2038.7 --> 2051.0
plasma ball really you made the ball

2043.269 --> 2053.56
lightning effect hmm interesting well

2051.0 --> 2055.51
yeah I've seen that even though I think

2053.56 --> 2057.31
I've even seen one once but yeah you

2055.51 --> 2059.0200000000004
don't really know what you're looking at

2057.31 --> 2061.569
unless the thing comes up really close

2059.02 --> 2063.909
and then you're not very happy but I've

2061.569 --> 2066.099
seen plenty of videos with ball

2063.909 --> 2070.54
lightnings that convinced me that that's

2066.099 --> 2076.869
a real thing and yeah maybe it is like a

2070.54 --> 2083.79
uniquely like an L yeah an electric

2076.869 --> 2086.77
clock somehow yeah somehow that keeps a

2083.79 --> 2091.679
perpetual electricity going causing that

2086.77 --> 2096.31
plasma state within that frame somehow

2091.679 --> 2098.71
without constant yeah at least there's

2096.31 --> 2102.43
not any polarized connection going on

2098.71 --> 2105.9700000000003
like regular lightning so but yeah okay

2102.43 --> 2108.7
I guess that that might classify as a

2105.97 --> 2111.9599999999996
natural phenomena concerning plasma I

2108.7 --> 2111.96
guess is a good one

2126.93 --> 2136.73
oh really George Sanford

2140.07 --> 2148.07
look if you ever go with their these

2143.46 --> 2148.07
phenomena and even lightning itself okay

2148.25 --> 2158.58
proves an enclosure proofs if a flat-top

2152.19 --> 2160.77
on the other side yeah you know there's

2158.58 --> 2163.98
already the second law of thermodynamics

2160.77 --> 2167.43
part of the proof for that and you have

2163.98 --> 2170.82
to blend biblical reference that stands

2167.43 --> 2172.3799999999997
pretty solid by itself no matter the

2170.82 --> 2176.31
other speculations you may have

2172.38 --> 2179.58
surrounding that so yeah sure lightning

2176.31 --> 2186.21
it's a polarized thing right so from up

2179.58 --> 2188.2799999999997
there down here okay yeah and the other

2186.21 --> 2190.77
phenomena you talked about sure sprites

2188.28 --> 2197.1000000000004
I know what I've seen the video it's

2190.77 --> 2198.66
very odd but it doesn't prove the actual

2197.1 --> 2203.46
thing in the word that you're using

2198.66 --> 2205.02
mainly the the dome factor the curve hey

2203.46 --> 2212.1
if there is something up there if

2205.02 --> 2214.32
there's a separation which in my current

2212.1 --> 2223.17
opinion would probably be best

2214.32 --> 2227.01
designated as a flat top then yes seems

2223.17 --> 2231.06
to be good indication that that is

2227.01 --> 2233.21
inevitable - to figure that out

2231.06 --> 2233.21
eventually

2262.85 --> 2265.69
hmm

2274.66 --> 2284.0389999999998
really Churchill would it if it were on

2279.7 --> 2288.9399999999996
a dome shape so have you ever been to a

2284.039 --> 2293.5490000000004
planetarium if you ever had that

2288.94 --> 2296.92
experience simulation of the heavens and

2293.549 --> 2300.4
I've been to some that look pretty damn

2296.92 --> 2304.4500000000003
convincing if you tell me so yeah the

2300.4 --> 2307.029
dumb thing actually does work but still

2304.45 --> 2309.729
that is a very specific setup that

2307.029 --> 2316.989
presumes that it's being projected at

2309.729 --> 2323.979
the core there and in reality the stars

2316.989 --> 2326.2
aren't really projected like that it

2323.979 --> 2330.549
seems like we're at the center of this

2326.2 --> 2333.069
apparent then my globe riddled with

2330.549 --> 2337.269
stars and heavenly bodies and the

2333.069 --> 2339.279
daylight and the night light then they

2337.269 --> 2343.359
seem to be specifically attuned to being

2339.279 --> 2348.509
at a distance in relation to us centered

2343.359 --> 2348.509
around our side around everything side

2353.87 --> 2362.1
so unless that dome is literally moving

2358.77 --> 2364.8
around with us as we move and everybody

2362.1 --> 2366.87
has their own separate well then it's

2364.8 --> 2372.0
got to be tough to claim a physical dome

2366.87 --> 2378.75
now isn't it yeah it just goes to show

2372.0 --> 2381.72
that that them.i globe off the heavens

2378.75 --> 2384.6
it hasn't I don't think there is any

2381.72 --> 2392.73
direct relations as to its appearance as

2384.6 --> 2399.75
a demographic of this realm I'm just

2392.73 --> 2402.51
telling you the Oracle physical feature

2399.75 --> 2405.87
relation it seems to have all these

2402.51 --> 2413.6400000000003
lights are in relation to the location

2405.87 --> 2415.88
on the earth rotational aspects that's

2413.64 --> 2415.8799999999997
it

2439.369 --> 2449.029
it's no spero music dance drama NOS the

2444.71 --> 2452.7200000000003
earth is not moving the apparent then my

2449.029 --> 2455.21
globe of the heavens these lights cannot

2452.72 --> 2459.22
be proven to be physical in nature or

2455.21 --> 2462.7400000000002
even have a literal position in any sort

2459.22 --> 2464.72
even a direct correlation is too little

2462.74 --> 2472.069
position in relation to other observers

2464.72 --> 2478.089
it's pretty bizarre right so they don't

2472.069 --> 2483.109
prove that we and this earth is moving

2478.089 --> 2485.89
the lights are moving and when we move

2483.109 --> 2490.21
on the earth then there's other thick

2485.89 --> 2493.73
types of movement the entire thing will

2490.21 --> 2497.7490000000003
move in a specific way correlating to

2493.73 --> 2501.65
how we move on the earth but there is

2497.749 --> 2503.839
nothing moving except for us when we

2501.65 --> 2506.63
move over the earth then we are moving

2503.839 --> 2509.989
and the earth is standing still it's no

2506.63 --> 2515.7690000000002
rotation there's no movement it's just

2509.989 --> 2518.859
there stationary the lights are moving

2515.769 --> 2523.1899999999996
and I think there was a specific

2518.859 --> 2526.16
experiment to even was it knit Aries

2523.19 --> 2530.089
failure that basically proved it that

2526.16 --> 2536.749
the stars are moving and not us

2530.089 --> 2538.339
underneath the stars and that's a widely

2536.749 --> 2542.8289999999997
accepted proof

2538.339 --> 2542.8289999999997
it's a scientifically valid proof

2543.64 --> 2547.3289999999997
historically recorded

2570.86 --> 2581.33
no I don't ignore any valid proof

2574.93 --> 2584.45
Sparrow music it was a straw man because

2581.33 --> 2586.91
doesn't work you don't have proof we're

2584.45 --> 2589.3399999999997
moving there's consequences of that and

2586.91 --> 2592.3999999999996
you don't have any proof it yeah

2589.34 --> 2594.5
Coriolis effect the Coriolis confusion

2592.4 --> 2598.9100000000003
situation that's been playing for the

2594.5 --> 2603.05
last year at least right nobody can even

2598.91 --> 2607.22
touch that nonsense the earth is not

2603.05 --> 2611.96
moving the lights are moving an Aries

2607.22 --> 2618.43
failure even proved that over a century

2611.96 --> 2618.43
ago whenever the farther okay

2628.03 --> 2631.1490000000003
[Music]

2635.82 --> 2644.6800000000003
yeah what Bob's support Jarl you mean

2641.41 --> 2650.1299999999997
the light based a laser gyro where the

2644.68 --> 2652.6299999999997
lights of his gyro actually created a

2650.13 --> 2655.53
15-degree she'd rift per hour

2652.63 --> 2662.23
it's funny isn't it that the light

2655.53 --> 2665.53
rotated 15 degrees some other mysterious

2662.23 --> 2668.5
light source that we know of does the

2665.53 --> 2673.2000000000003
same thing which one was that

2668.5 --> 2673.2
mm-hmm oh wait the globe of the heavens

2674.1 --> 2685.24
hmm it's a fascinating correlation can't

2682.42 --> 2687.82
tie any causation into it but it is very

2685.24 --> 2692.74
telling that something light based

2687.82 --> 2700.3300000000004
specifically has a mysterious aberration

2692.74 --> 2703.87
to 15 degree turn and why fit why not 17

2700.33 --> 2708.64
and a half degree turn you know why why

2703.87 --> 2711.4
that thing seems kind of like the

2708.64 --> 2718.21
correlation correlation yeah yeah it is

2711.4 --> 2721.51
a correlation and that's it ooh almost

2718.21 --> 2724.38
times you out there you know how I feel

2721.51 --> 2724.38
about that icon

2732.93 --> 2740.52
all right and yeah trigger troll its I

2735.84 --> 2744.2400000000002
call it the globe of the heavens I don't

2740.52 --> 2746.73
know I believe for the power of the

2744.24 --> 2749.97
words and the idea technically it's not

2746.73 --> 2753.21
a globe it's always a damn my Globe but

2749.97 --> 2756.33
if you would fill in the things that you

2753.21 --> 2759.75
would never see about it and draw the

2756.33 --> 2761.85
logical consequence then yeah all put

2759.75 --> 2768.24
together that could never be seen at

2761.85 --> 2771.5699999999997
once it would be a globe but nobody ever

2768.24 --> 2777.0299999999997
sees anything other than a damn I hope

2771.57 --> 2779.2400000000002
of the heavens yeah that's the funny

2777.03 --> 2781.92
thing if you call a celestial sphere or

2779.24 --> 2785.22
globe of the heavens that does like

2781.92 --> 2787.77
carry a little bit of extra mystical

2785.22 --> 2789.87
power with the words and it is very

2787.77 --> 2791.7599999999998
mystical seriously I think that the

2789.87 --> 2795.42
globe of the heavens and freaking Sun

2791.76 --> 2799.9500000000003
just like I did just every day just I

2795.42 --> 2801.39
think they're like like yeah

2799.95 --> 2804.72
everything's all right everything is

2801.39 --> 2807.75
just gonna go as it does but oh my god

2804.72 --> 2811.5
what is going on what is that the Sun

2807.75 --> 2814.53
and just how the light works every time

2811.5 --> 2817.5
in how it shifts and I'm just astounded

2814.53 --> 2823.4700000000003
by things that everybody takes for

2817.5 --> 2826.11
granted but yeah I don't know as the

2823.47 --> 2828.0299999999997
more I started to the lights of the

2826.11 --> 2831.3900000000003
heavens and all the light and how it

2828.03 --> 2833.52
reflects upon what I see with the

2831.39 --> 2838.2799999999997
heavens as a source the more I am just

2833.52 --> 2843.66
astounded by the sight of it all and

2838.28 --> 2847.17
yeah the more and more I look at it the

2843.66 --> 2852.3599999999997
more doubts about its holographic nature

2847.17 --> 2855.75
is taken away from me because it just

2852.36 --> 2859.77
all really looks very holographic to me

2855.75 --> 2862.98
and I'm starting to figure out that yeah

2859.77 --> 2864.46
part of the the miraculous sight of some

2862.98 --> 2868.999
of the sights

2864.46 --> 2871.7
that that is very specifically visible

2868.999 --> 2873.499
in relation to my position at such a

2871.7 --> 2875.96
time and that if another person would be

2873.499 --> 2879.14
at a other location they would look at

2875.96 --> 2880.549
the same features so what I would see

2879.14 --> 2883.819
that they would see something completely

2880.549 --> 2886.9
different because of how the light

2883.819 --> 2889.579
really works and that is just

2886.9 --> 2898.4300000000003
mind-blowing realization to me every

2889.579 --> 2901.119
time so no it's just the wonders of

2898.43 --> 2901.1189999999997
creation

2909.18 --> 2911.8999999999996
right

2914.06 --> 2918.67
yeah that's that's true more colored but

2919.39 --> 2924.5
we've arrived in a state where there's

2921.86 --> 2927.6800000000003
just so much nonsense going on in

2924.5 --> 2931.22
general that I don't know a government

2927.68 --> 2934.46
would really have to just aggressively

2931.22 --> 2938.06
address it like say yes we're can't

2934.46 --> 2941.36
really yes look this that that today

2938.06 --> 2943.04
yesterday today tomorrow we will keep on

2941.36 --> 2947.4500000000003
doing this is going to be the result of

2943.04 --> 2953.69
it on the long run and this is yeah it

2947.45 --> 2958.2799999999997
bats they do that maybe that vast

2953.69 --> 2962.29
majority majority will suddenly like huh

2958.28 --> 2964.3700000000003
okay maybe they are doing something

2962.29 --> 2972.35
because that's how much it takes

2964.37 --> 2975.3199999999997
nowadays you know people with the more

2972.35 --> 2977.87
chaos the aggravation of the chaos

2975.32 --> 2980.0
introduced in media the agitation the

2977.87 --> 2984.3199999999997
trickery that trying to pull you in the

2980.0 --> 2988.13
hooks all this methodology the more the

2984.32 --> 2991.07
average public learns to deal with it by

2988.13 --> 2994.4300000000003
just filtering as much out as they can

2991.07 --> 2996.8300000000004
but as they do that as they step away

2994.43 --> 3001.1499999999996
from much of it so do they not really

2996.83 --> 3003.7
learn about it and that gives them an

3001.15 --> 3007.75
advantage in a way but on the long run

3003.7 --> 3009.3399999999997
also a disadvantage and the disadvantage

3007.75 --> 3016.72
is that they'll get more and more

3009.34 --> 3019.86
confused about what's going on it's

3016.72 --> 3019.8599999999997
weird how that all works out

3024.65 --> 3030.51
so yeah chemtrails yeah that's going on

3027.21 --> 3034.64
it's it's irregular though there it

3030.51 --> 3038.059
seems like they've stepped away from

3034.64 --> 3041.25
really trying to hide it and more

3038.059 --> 3045.42
subjecting a level of theater to it in

3041.25 --> 3047.25
order to not create too much unrest I

3045.42 --> 3053.309
think and that's why they have chem free

3047.25 --> 3056.849
chem trail free days and yeah you know

3053.309 --> 3058.92
it could probably be even also with just

3056.849 --> 3061.53
general weather decision-making and that

3058.92 --> 3064.29
sometimes they just don't spray because

3061.53 --> 3065.849
they have to allow a certain transition

3064.29 --> 3069.48
to happen like for example that's

3065.849 --> 3071.6090000000004
freezing like getting gold it's logical

3069.48 --> 3073.559
because if there's clear skies without a

3071.609 --> 3077.819
lot of clouds then it'll get very cold

3073.559 --> 3082.349
so yeah again multi-purpose for the

3077.819 --> 3086.339
entire chemtrail program so wide from

3082.349 --> 3091.349
actual potential viable world management

3086.339 --> 3096.75
up to absolute grab ler malarkey all of

3091.349 --> 3102.059
it is in it and it's now just like sort

3096.75 --> 3106.049
of yeah not really being hidden that

3102.059 --> 3107.88
much anymore more talked about it's like

3106.049 --> 3110.04
this thing is running and people are

3107.88 --> 3115.559
like okay what are we actually gonna do

3110.04 --> 3119.22
with it on the long run how are we gonna

3115.559 --> 3121.53
reflect this upon the public good things

3119.22 --> 3126.089
to it bad things to it and where do we

3121.53 --> 3127.559
go where do we allow the public to think

3126.089 --> 3131.609
that they can have some kind of

3127.559 --> 3136.079
influence on it or do we not do that and

3131.609 --> 3138.839
do we keep it our priesthood secret bag

3136.079 --> 3141.329
of tricks and make sure that nobody that

3138.839 --> 3144.5099999999998
has reach of as access to the bag of

3141.329 --> 3147.42
tricks abuses it to damage us that kind

3144.51 --> 3150.03
of thing like a nobility secret trick

3147.42 --> 3151.829
hey the nobility loft that kind of [ __ ]

3150.03 --> 3153.9300000000003
back in the day when they had more

3151.829 --> 3155.1600000000003
control you know knowledge was power

3153.93 --> 3158.22
somebody had some

3155.16 --> 3162.1499999999996
really interesting device or whatever or

3158.22 --> 3165.4199999999996
invention or a chemistry trick they they

3162.15 --> 3170.88
keep it for themselves and they use it

3165.42 --> 3173.67
for special occasions so yeah maybe

3170.88 --> 3175.71
they're still working on what to do with

3173.67 --> 3177.84
it what did we do with the new

3175.71 --> 3182.73
engineering program and at the same time

3177.84 --> 3187.1400000000003
of course crazy climate change nonsense

3182.73 --> 3188.73
groups and cults are just getting more

3187.14 --> 3190.7999999999997
put out they're given more media

3188.73 --> 3193.65
attention from all sides even just

3190.8 --> 3196.86
looking at like what is this why are

3193.65 --> 3198.96
they so crazy why is it so insane why is

3196.86 --> 3200.6400000000003
it getting so much momentum why are they

3198.96 --> 3206.04
getting so much money what the hell is

3200.64 --> 3211.56
happening that yeah it seems like a big

3206.04 --> 3215.36
theater piece also in a way and I think

3211.56 --> 3218.73
that that climate change cult is

3215.36 --> 3222.4500000000003
probably helping to distract away a lot

3218.73 --> 3224.61
from getting involve more in the

3222.45 --> 3227.97
direction of chemtrails taking it as a

3224.61 --> 3231.1200000000003
subject addressing the government to it

3227.97 --> 3235.23
instead we are being kept busy with this

3231.12 --> 3240.5699999999997
climate insanity of some maniac group of

3235.23 --> 3248.31
people being funded by big corporations

3240.57 --> 3252.4500000000003
and and all that and certain nefarious

3248.31 --> 3255.99
groups of people to distract us by

3252.45 --> 3259.5
threatening to take away just basic

3255.99 --> 3265.5
fundamental life come yeah rights and

3259.5 --> 3269.79
[ __ ] just a dier dier attack on our very

3265.5 --> 3272.79
survival elements that's what they're

3269.79 --> 3275.73
distracting us with in the form of

3272.79 --> 3278.88
climate change cults and the media

3275.73 --> 3282.18
attention they get and that distracts

3278.88 --> 3284.33
away from how people instead of spending

3282.18 --> 3289.58
their time on fighting all that and

3284.33 --> 3292.35
trying to prevent these insane yeah

3289.58 --> 3294.99
climate deals all that nonsense in

3292.35 --> 3297.6
politics from ruining everything

3294.99 --> 3300.12
or if it wasn't there then they could

3297.6 --> 3303.6
have more directly spent their energy

3300.12 --> 3307.71
and efforts to get some inquiry on the

3303.6 --> 3311.1
chemtrail situation so yeah see that's

3307.71 --> 3313.23
how it's all put together even things

3311.1 --> 3318.5099999999998
that are completely useless are never

3313.23 --> 3322.65
really useless because they can be used

3318.51 --> 3327.09
as distractions to focus to force

3322.65 --> 3333.27
people's focus it's it's another form of

3327.09 --> 3335.4300000000003
agitation porn but instead of using it

3333.27 --> 3338.73
to draw attention to yourself and then

3335.43 --> 3340.23
make money or whatever try to trick

3338.73 --> 3343.5
people out of their money it is

3340.23 --> 3345.42
literally to put the spotlight on

3343.5 --> 3347.4
something else even though it's

3345.42 --> 3349.7400000000002
nonsensical so people look at that

3347.4 --> 3353.0
instead of something else that's out

3349.74 --> 3353.0
there that you don't want see

3363.87 --> 3368.49
yeah and that's the that's the whole

3366.15 --> 3369.89
thing every time that the whole climate

3368.49 --> 3373.56
change nonsense

3369.89 --> 3376.08
inquiry about people supposedly ruining

3373.56 --> 3379.68
the future of the world by our

3376.08 --> 3381.72
influences they can always revert to

3379.68 --> 3384.45
chemtrails in some kind of fashion

3381.72 --> 3387.23
within their nonsense story build-up

3384.45 --> 3390.5099999999998
that oh it could be used to fight

3387.23 --> 3392.52
whatever they figured whatever they are

3390.51 --> 3396.0
conceptualizing as being a threat at the

3392.52 --> 3397.65
moment so they can just take it and see

3396.0 --> 3401.46
oh yeah see it's not bad

3397.65 --> 3403.23
from their crazy point of view and if

3401.46 --> 3406.62
you're looking at it superficially yeah

3403.23 --> 3408.54
then you don't necessarily pick up on it

3406.62 --> 3411.7799999999997
in a threatening you don't really see

3408.54 --> 3414.6
what that is and that is out there

3411.78 --> 3422.55
already it's just yeah it's complicated

3414.6 --> 3429.5099999999998
how this trickery works how dare you how

3422.55 --> 3436.02
dare you take away my my future yeah she

3429.51 --> 3444.3500000000004
really has that theatrical voice tell

3436.02 --> 3444.35
you what's with next climate change

3449.09 --> 3452.4990000000003
[Music]

3461.04 --> 3464.46
funny isn't it

3473.21 --> 3484.32
yeah man I'm sometimes so bare with it

3477.89 --> 3487.5
I'm sometimes really jealous Oh Big Bear

3484.32 --> 3491.6090000000004
of Owen Benjamin and man that does that

3487.5 --> 3498.02
video yes and they oh my god actual

3491.609 --> 3501.5699999999997
video made by the Rothschilds it's just

3498.02 --> 3509.31
it was so funny and so crazy it's just

3501.57 --> 3514.6800000000003
even saying but I think it's it must

3509.31 --> 3515.839
have been like I wonder I wasn't I

3514.68 --> 3521.0989999999997
didn't hear

3515.839 --> 3523.7
well oh okay let's just put this out put

3521.099 --> 3527.1600000000003
like a 5-10 minute piece about it but

3523.7 --> 3532.89
yeah there was this video it was in the

3527.16 --> 3537.71
30s 41 or something and Hitler used a

3532.89 --> 3541.859
part of that video as is as propaganda

3537.71 --> 3544.68
to target Jews as it were that's technic

3541.859 --> 3547.0989999999997
historically technically correct but the

3544.68 --> 3551.0099999999998
weird thing about that video was it was

3547.099 --> 3555.53
released with the official intention to

3551.01 --> 3561.51
be a diplomatic piece to draw in

3555.53 --> 3564.8100000000004
sympathy for the Rothschilds but it's

3561.51 --> 3570.2400000000002
almost you almost can't take that

3564.81 --> 3573.38
seriously because really you know what I

3570.24 --> 3580.31
think that it might have actually been

3573.38 --> 3585.15
it might have been intentionally a spark

3580.31 --> 3590.52
to light the war in a way that they were

3585.15 --> 3593.1600000000003
actually just rubbing it in their face

3590.52 --> 3596.88
almost like covertly threatening them

3593.16 --> 3599.73
but like yeah this is what we do and

3596.88 --> 3602.869
guess what everybody on our side is just

3599.73 --> 3602.869
thinking this is funny

3603.87 --> 3619.3199999999997
see how weird the magic of that in it's

3609.05 --> 3621.69
baffling absolutely it's it's something

3619.32 --> 3625.8300000000004
that I have to probably watch carefully

3621.69 --> 3631.19
again and just look at at every detail

3625.83 --> 3631.19
and it was extremely fascinating

3640.82 --> 3643.82
because

3647.019 --> 3652.7889999999998
you wonder like what is the perspective

3649.759 --> 3657.049
behind the motivation of building all

3652.789 --> 3659.779
that could it be that it was like a plea

3657.049 --> 3662.779
and that well god forbid that there were

3659.779 --> 3665.45
actually much worse details that were

3662.779 --> 3668.75
being scrubbed out of the story that

3665.45 --> 3671.96
were part of like okay this that the

3668.75 --> 3674.72
Rothschilds literally just yeah we

3671.96 --> 3678.109
wouldn't be surprised if well that time

3674.72 --> 3680.39
probably if they were absolute just out

3678.109 --> 3684.259
of their mind Psychopaths about it just

3680.39 --> 3687.23
so zealous that they probably had

3684.259 --> 3690.079
trouble even sizing up what people would

3687.23 --> 3692.2400000000002
find disgusting because their sense is

3690.079 --> 3695.569
concerning that was just so destroyed

3692.24 --> 3697.339
and that they let these movie makers

3695.569 --> 3701.329
then do this thing and they tried to

3697.339 --> 3706.43
like okay turn it someone into it like

3701.329 --> 3709.73
okay like the silly Jews and sort of

3706.43 --> 3717.74
still like yeah they did it's so weird

3709.73 --> 3725.69
the whole thing is just what is it don't

3717.74 --> 3729.019
really it hit me so hard and and I

3725.69 --> 3734.299
remember a long long time ago also be it

3729.019 --> 3738.2589999999996
is old to have seen a hint of its

3734.299 --> 3740.9
existence at least very shortly and it

3738.259 --> 3743.38
was absolutely surreal to me back back

3740.9 --> 3743.38
