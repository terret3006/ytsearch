oh yeah

153.0 --> 159.9
yeah it's frosty as [ __ ] no that's not a

156.9 --> 163.20000000000002
good way to say it it's just there's

159.9 --> 166.26000000000002
still ice like on the roofs on the cars

163.2 --> 169.2
it's frozen outside

166.26 --> 170.819
and I'm well happy

169.2 --> 172.64
that I don't have to go out for

170.819 --> 177.54
groceries then again

172.64 --> 178.92
yeah uh yesterday as I was yesterday's

177.54 --> 180.72
show was great by the way I was really

178.92 --> 182.879
happy with the Flat Earth early bird

180.72 --> 185.099
show from yesterday

182.879 --> 187.7
I mean was very happy to put all that

185.099 --> 187.7
down and

188.12 --> 196.09900000000002
but yeah it was really cold outside and

192.06 --> 196.099
then like during every day

196.319 --> 201.72
I tried to like hurry get some groceries

199.08 --> 204.72
on my bike

201.72 --> 206.4
and then I sprained my lower back

204.72 --> 209.54
on the

206.4 --> 209.54
going there

213.0 --> 217.879
yeah I forgot about how much that sucks

219.599 --> 225.17999999999998
so yeah

222.78 --> 227.34
I mean I literally like stood there for

225.18 --> 230.15900000000002
five minutes straight just sweating my

227.34 --> 232.98
ass off because of the freaking pain as

230.159 --> 235.379
I just lit I was trying to get off my

232.98 --> 237.29899999999998
bike took me five minutes

235.379 --> 238.85999999999999
like without falling over in the middle

237.299 --> 240.36
of the street while it was freezing

238.86 --> 242.34
around me and people were just walking

240.36 --> 246.26000000000002
past and

242.34 --> 246.26
nobody even said anything

247.2 --> 252.06
somebody inside was looking funny at me

249.84 --> 256.38
like what is up with him yeah yeah I've

252.06 --> 259.22
been freaking pain dude for five minutes

256.38 --> 259.21999999999997
it was

259.5 --> 264.479
I basically

262.019 --> 267.12
soldiered my way through it just like

264.479 --> 270.419
okay I guess I'll have to walk part of

267.12 --> 272.04
the way then just to make sure that it

270.419 --> 274.02
keeps stretched enough so that it

272.04 --> 275.699
doesn't like totally freeze up and keep

274.02 --> 279.139
my blood going

275.699 --> 279.139
because it's freaking cool

280.32 --> 284.04
back pain is the word yeah

282.54 --> 286.5
well

284.04 --> 289.62
there's worse things to be fair but it's

286.5 --> 290.84
such a freaking hassle it's such a

289.62 --> 292.86
hassle man

290.84 --> 294.84
especially like when it's your lower

292.86 --> 297.66
back

294.84 --> 300.65999999999997
I mean you're pretty much disabled when

297.66 --> 303.36
that happens for a day

300.66 --> 305.34000000000003
so I was actually thinking of not doing

303.36 --> 308.40000000000003
the show today but then I thought like

305.34 --> 310.67999999999995
screw that I want to show you

308.4 --> 313.19899999999996
the weather and I do actually feel

310.68 --> 316.8
pretty good despite the freaking back

313.199 --> 320.94
issues despite half an hour ago

316.8 --> 323.40000000000003
I was like trying to get the socket into

320.94 --> 326.28
the plug or the plug into the socket for

323.4 --> 328.919
my heater and then I sprayed like as I

326.28 --> 332.69899999999996
was in like a clumsy position and it

328.919 --> 335.94
just lay there like ah like on my side

332.699 --> 338.1
with my knees I'm like ah literally like

335.94 --> 342.08
this for like two minutes because it

338.1 --> 342.08000000000004
just could not move it was so [ __ ]

342.66 --> 349.5
right really annoying

345.479 --> 352.02
but uh yeah it's okay I got a warm water

349.5 --> 354.9
bottle that I literally put in between

352.02 --> 358.15999999999997
my sweater and my shirt on my lower back

354.9 --> 358.15999999999997
very helpful

362.6 --> 368.16
hey anyway hello all's first in chat Del

366.36 --> 369.21000000000004
West Watson

368.16 --> 372.54
I could see you

369.21 --> 372.53999999999996
[Music]

375.12 --> 379.74
I'm just really happy I don't like have

377.639 --> 382.08
a job or something well if you have a

379.74 --> 385.039
job you just call in sick of course but

382.08 --> 385.039
still it's so

385.62 --> 388.4
I mean

388.68 --> 393.539
yeah I don't want to say this but

391.319 --> 395.34000000000003
technically like this is one of the few

393.539 --> 396.479
moments where I'm kind of happy I don't

395.34 --> 398.69899999999996
have kids

396.479 --> 401.81899999999996
because having this kind of issue and

398.699 --> 404.759
having kids around is a nightmare

401.819 --> 406.91900000000004
they will poke you they because you're

404.759 --> 409.61
like oh and then kids are going to be

406.919 --> 411.12
like oh why are you so Rusty

409.61 --> 413.759
[Music]

411.12 --> 416.22
I mean I used to do that as a kid and it

413.759 --> 421.199
did it was just

416.22 --> 421.199
little kid not older but

421.5 --> 425.34
you become so vulnerable when this [ __ ]

424.08 --> 428.94
happens

425.34 --> 434.09999999999997
the better ride home wasn't much fun it

428.94 --> 438.06
was doable no it was dude it was just

434.1 --> 441.41900000000004
I sprained my back as I was like as I

438.06 --> 443.46
just got underway pretty much but far

441.419 --> 445.31899999999996
enough that I couldn't just quickly go

443.46 --> 447.78
back

445.319 --> 450.3
so I still had to do it you know but

447.78 --> 451.61999999999995
look once you Soldier your way through

450.3 --> 453.78000000000003
it

451.62 --> 455.639
and just like yeah it hurts yeah it

453.78 --> 458.63899999999995
hurts yeah yeah gotta keep it straight

455.639 --> 461.28000000000003
yeah here gotta keep going right

458.639 --> 464.639
and you don't [ __ ] it up right you don't

461.28 --> 466.85999999999996
like completely fall over or slip yeah

464.639 --> 469.08
oh God thank God I didn't slip on some

466.86 --> 472.319
ice on top of that or something

469.08 --> 474.12
but it wasn't all Frozen up when it was

472.319 --> 476.759
going out

474.12 --> 478.259
but uh

476.759 --> 482.16
yeah

478.259 --> 484.97900000000004
what like after like the 15 minutes

482.16 --> 487.08000000000004
or like after five minutes I was able to

484.979 --> 489.0
actually get back on the bike and after

487.08 --> 490.919
that point it wasn't that tough

489.0 --> 493.139
all you have to do is just be hyper

490.919 --> 495.68
alert because of one second of letting

493.139 --> 498.479
your attention that is crazy

495.68 --> 500.52
so it's it's just that's just like no I

498.479 --> 502.02
gotta be alert like literally soldiers

500.52 --> 504.71999999999997
about to stab me in the back because

502.02 --> 507.78
that's metaphorically what happens if I

504.72 --> 509.40000000000003
don't do this constantly like it you

507.78 --> 513.24
just have to have like a separate

509.4 --> 517.3389999999999
attention that never never wavers

513.24 --> 517.339
and then it's doable ugh

518.039 --> 520.58
right

523.9 --> 526.919
[Music]

528.24 --> 535.019
no but yeah even today it's much better

531.839 --> 536.94
it just yeah if you don't

535.019 --> 538.5600000000001
it's kind of tempting

536.94 --> 540.6600000000001
because it's like oh yeah it's almost

538.56 --> 544.0189999999999
better and then you think like oh can I

540.66 --> 547.0799999999999
test it again and there's a no not yet

544.019 --> 549.48
so that's like when it just hurts it's

547.08 --> 551.1
like oh draw you're not gonna have like

549.48 --> 553.6800000000001
the tendency like oh is it better again

551.1 --> 556.6800000000001
than stretch and then

553.68 --> 558.899
but now it's like no it is better so I

556.68 --> 561.0
just have this impulse like is it is it

558.899 --> 563.64
good again

561.0 --> 565.8
to test it anyway I'm not gonna

563.64 --> 569.04
uh it's maybe a little too late I'm not

565.8 --> 571.0799999999999
gonna drench you in this condition

569.04 --> 573.66
it does typically happen to a lot of

571.08 --> 576.3000000000001
people when suddenly like a lot of cold

573.66 --> 577.5
sets in

576.3 --> 580.68
but

577.5 --> 581.64
then I think personally it has to do

580.68 --> 584.519
with

581.64 --> 587.399
just the cold causing your muscles to

584.519 --> 590.339
cramp more to generate Heat

587.399 --> 593.94
but then if you don't stretch them

590.339 --> 595.08
then it actually sort of congests the

593.94 --> 598.9200000000001
blood flow

595.08 --> 602.279
which then causes them to be become like

598.92 --> 605.459
hypertense maybe Frozen and then yeah

602.279 --> 607.62
that happens in your back you're [ __ ]

605.459 --> 611.279
and I think that's what happened and I

607.62 --> 613.2
normally have like routines as I as I'm

611.279 --> 615.8389999999999
in bed and all that

613.2 --> 617.76
to literally just make sure everything

615.839 --> 620.22
is stretched and all that just like

617.76 --> 623.9399999999999
micro gymnastics but it's really

620.22 --> 626.1600000000001
important to do that if you have like

623.94 --> 627.6
Tendencies of these types of backs

626.16 --> 630.7199999999999
issues

627.6 --> 632.399
but apparently I forgot or something

630.72 --> 634.2
you know and you just one time you

632.399 --> 637.76
forget that

634.2 --> 637.76
and yeah this happens

639.12 --> 645.72
anyway I'm pretty sure it's gonna be

641.779 --> 646.62
restored by probably tomorrow or the day

645.72 --> 648.6600000000001
after

646.62 --> 651.12
and I don't have to go out I actually

648.66 --> 653.399
like yeah that was the one advantage

651.12 --> 656.399
because I sprayed my back before I went

653.399 --> 659.7
to the supermarket I was like okay I'm

656.399 --> 662.76
just gonna stock up on stuff

659.7 --> 664.1400000000001
for like the next for today and the next

662.76 --> 668.16
two days

664.14 --> 669.66
so that I don't have to actually go back

668.16 --> 673.4399999999999
so yeah

669.66 --> 676.92
anyway do you do any sports no not

673.44 --> 678.5400000000001
really I mean everything I do is a sport

676.92 --> 684.12
like

678.54 --> 687.54
I got I live at the top floor of uh very

684.12 --> 690.12
small flat apartment building like what

687.54 --> 692.0999999999999
is it four stories high

690.12 --> 694.8
but there's no elevator so I have to go

692.1 --> 697.86
go up and down the stairs almost every

694.8 --> 701.16
day I use that as sport

697.86 --> 703.5
I go on a bicycle I use that as sport

701.16 --> 706.8
it's pretty much everything physical I

703.5 --> 709.8
do I do a sport

706.8 --> 714.3
I just always pay it doesn't mean that I

709.8 --> 718.14
get all like super into it necessarily

714.3 --> 720.3
but I just do it with care and attention

718.14 --> 722.519
every Everything I Do

720.3 --> 724.62
and then that is effective just like

722.519 --> 728.54
sport

724.62 --> 728.54
of Mobility 10.

736.74 --> 741.779
right but when I when it's like this

739.38 --> 744.42
yeah I'm not gonna do any like

741.779 --> 747.48
stretching like that

744.42 --> 752.519
I mean it's the great trick is to just

747.48 --> 754.5600000000001
somehow get your muscles to go back to

752.519 --> 757.079
the original position right that's

754.56 --> 760.8
already a challenge I'm not gonna

757.079 --> 762.3599999999999
you're not gonna do spawn stretches when

760.8 --> 766.2199999999999
you have this anyway

762.36 --> 766.22
I know status Moretz good to see you

767.94 --> 770.36
all right

775.56 --> 780.899
probably gonna take some bone broth

777.839 --> 784.6800000000001
later on today because I know that

780.899 --> 787.26
typically helps I mean it's literally

784.68 --> 789.8
for this kind of situation that helps

787.26 --> 789.8
really well

794.52 --> 801.12
[Music]

797.339 --> 803.7
right but I gotta live through the day I

801.12 --> 806.579
got bears for later and I I got my

803.7 --> 810.6800000000001
cannabis so I'm literally stocked up for

806.579 --> 810.68
everything for three days I'm okay

811.92 --> 817.38
I was also lucky enough to be able to

814.2 --> 821.94
well afford that because everything from

817.38 --> 826.459
the PayPal came in all at once on Monday

821.94 --> 826.4590000000001
I also have to pay off some debt anyway

826.56 --> 829.579
hope you guys

829.86 --> 835.5790000000001
don't have this issue

832.86 --> 835.5790000000001
and

835.98 --> 838.5790000000001
yeah

838.8 --> 843.74
I just wanted to share since there's

840.959 --> 847.079
some people here I found this amazing

843.74 --> 849.98
amazing piece of music electronic music

847.079 --> 849.9799999999999
to the next level

850.92 --> 855.8389999999999
this of course it's Russian

853.8 --> 858.24
but seriously this is like one of the

855.839 --> 860.9590000000001
most advanced electronic pieces of music

858.24 --> 860.9590000000001
I've ever heard

863.399 --> 870.899
that I bumped into that yesterday

866.579 --> 873.7199999999999
so yeah if you like electronic music

870.899 --> 876.06
the good base then

873.72 --> 878.22
and you like anything in the direction

876.06 --> 880.4399999999999
of what I like you'll probably like this

878.22 --> 882.36
one too

880.44 --> 885.6800000000001
it's a

882.36 --> 885.6800000000001
I thought it was quite beautiful

886.279 --> 892.76
and interesting anyway

889.8 --> 892.76
so there's that

906.899 --> 912.0
it's a

909.3 --> 914.9399999999999
a good song for when you're with a loved

912.0 --> 917.459
one by the way you'll probably be able

914.94 --> 919.2700000000001
to figure that out quickly

917.459 --> 922.399
mm-hmm

919.27 --> 922.399
[Music]

925.079 --> 928.8
let's see yeah Flat Earth debates

927.48 --> 931.1990000000001
yesterday

928.8 --> 933.7199999999999
well yeah because of the back issue I

931.199 --> 937.079
missed the entire live show

933.72 --> 939.9590000000001
because I ended a little early

937.079 --> 942.42
then I went out for groceries before the

939.959 --> 945.18
show went live and then I sprained my

942.42 --> 947.8199999999999
back and then it took all a long time

945.18 --> 950.88
and then when I got back it was like

947.82 --> 954.62
10 minutes after the after show or yeah

950.88 --> 954.62
after the live show had ended already

958.92 --> 963.36
but it did go on pretty long

961.48 --> 966.9590000000001
[Music]

963.36 --> 969.54
again oh yeah and we had this silly

966.959 --> 971.5189999999999
we it went pretty damn silly and you

969.54 --> 972.54
have to show at the end and I mean silly

971.519 --> 975.24
silly

972.54 --> 978.24
we were literally just like little kids

975.24 --> 981.0
just all of us like everybody hit the

978.24 --> 984.54
battle ones like

981.0 --> 987.54
who would win in a fight Batman or

984.54 --> 992.3389999999999
Superman and then like everything

987.54 --> 995.04
like that just from one thing to another

992.339 --> 997.139
from and eventually like even oh how

995.04 --> 999.66
about this anti-flatter third against

997.139 --> 1003.199
this

999.66 --> 1005.6
thing or something it was so silly but

1003.199 --> 1008.18
very enjoyable though to do that one

1005.6 --> 1011.9590000000001
time let's not keep doing that but it

1008.18 --> 1014.54
was it was very silly but very funny

1011.959 --> 1016.5189999999999
and kiwi was in there and it was like

1014.54 --> 1019.12
one of the few times he was actually in

1016.519 --> 1019.12
a good mood

1021.92 --> 1026.299
so that was already like wow kiwi in a

1024.98 --> 1029.299
good mood that's

1026.299 --> 1031.9
that's pretty that's special

1029.299 --> 1031.9
uh

1034.22 --> 1039.8600000000001
QE did like also do uh

1037.52 --> 1042.439
another review video I mean the guy

1039.86 --> 1045.5
keeps pumping it out man

1042.439 --> 1047.66
he's like on the hunt he's like a winter

1045.5 --> 1049.58
wolf on the hunt

1047.66 --> 1051.0800000000002
I've never seen him make so many live

1049.58 --> 1053.9189999999999
videos

1051.08 --> 1053.9189999999999
recently

1058.34 --> 1062.3799999999999
but yeah he went after Bev

1062.48 --> 1068.9
because Bev did a really stupid review

1065.179 --> 1072.799
video about fed

1068.9 --> 1074.919
and kiwi didn't have didn't what do you

1072.799 --> 1074.9189999999999
say

1075.02 --> 1077.62
foreign

1079.96 --> 1083.9
he wasn't gonna take it that's the

1082.34 --> 1086.799
that's the right thing and he literally

1083.9 --> 1090.74
like interrupted him every half a second

1086.799 --> 1092.66
you dumb [ __ ] you're stupid and to be

1090.74 --> 1095.9
fair yeah he

1092.66 --> 1100.3600000000001
QE is right he did pile it on top a bit

1095.9 --> 1100.3600000000001
much but he was pretty much right

1100.7 --> 1106.52
Beth can be like a complete just a

1103.76 --> 1108.679
stubborn ass

1106.52 --> 1110.96
like I mean he's always stubborn but he

1108.679 --> 1113.24
could he he also allows that

1110.96 --> 1115.3400000000001
stubbornness to just turn him into a

1113.24 --> 1117.38
complete ass

1115.34 --> 1121.1
this is

1117.38 --> 1123.44
I I don't enjoy baths shows at all

1121.1 --> 1125.4189999999999
I mean

1123.44 --> 1129.64
there's barely any coherent conversation

1125.419 --> 1129.64
happening there and ever so

1129.799 --> 1135.32
hello anybody anybody out there are you

1132.98 --> 1137.84

five minutes of silence am I this

1143.24 --> 1145.78

ah

1147.08 --> 1150.8799999999999
hey Mike sirunich good to see you

1156.62 --> 1161.9189999999999
song isn't it it's it's beautiful it's

1159.14 --> 1161.919
also very

1166.94 --> 1171.039

1180.26 --> 1184.52
oh since you also did your dinner oh ah

1182.9 --> 1187.8200000000002
I didn't know that stats Moretz right

1184.52 --> 1191.2
yeah well this is uh

1187.82 --> 1194.84
one of the most technologically advanced

1191.2 --> 1197.44
digitally created from scratch song that

1194.84 --> 1204.6499999999999
I've ever heard

1197.44 --> 1204.65
[Music]

1208.88 --> 1212.9
deep Club

1211.1 --> 1215.24
okay

1212.9 --> 1217.94
I can't listen that to that during the

1215.24 --> 1221.36
show though dude if I did if I could do

1217.94 --> 1224.5
that I'd put on one Arrow one shot

1221.36 --> 1224.5
from Alec page

1225.98 --> 1229.539
that's the song that I shared

1230.059 --> 1234.799
well the mixed version

1232.82 --> 1237.08
the original is a little bit more

1234.799 --> 1239.3799999999999
clear-cut but I really like the the

1237.08 --> 1239.3799999999999
remix

1240.799 --> 1248.98
it's no no I can actually I did click on

1244.58 --> 1248.98
it I just can't play it with the sound

1253.39 --> 1261.0900000000001
[Music]

1258.86 --> 1265.4399999999998
I'll check it out after the show

1261.09 --> 1265.4399999999998

foreign

1306.97 --> 1323.67
[Music]

1331.059 --> 1336.32
Brian's logic just shared a link to a

1333.679 --> 1341.0590000000002
video that's

1336.32 --> 1344.1399999999999
that is going to be incredibly stupid

1341.059 --> 1344.1399999999999
some Boomer

1344.659 --> 1352.1000000000001
saying that oh this accident proved that

1349.039 --> 1356.059
the total stupidity of flat earthers yes

1352.1 --> 1358.8799999999999
really some stupid old gray-haired

1356.059 --> 1360.2
Boomer made a video about that

1358.88 --> 1362.1200000000001
uh

1360.2 --> 1363.44
and we're probably gonna review it on

1362.12 --> 1366.34
fvd

1363.44 --> 1366.3400000000001
is my guess

1366.919 --> 1372.6200000000001
so if you wanna some heads up for not

1370.039 --> 1374.6
cool music but really annoying

1372.62 --> 1376.58
anti-flatter through videos of somebody

1374.6 --> 1379.2199999999998
you've probably never seen before that

1376.58 --> 1381.58
we're gonna review later on in fpd here

1379.22 --> 1381.58
it is

1391.88 --> 1394.419
ah

1396.66 --> 1399.739
[Music]

1411.32 --> 1416.5
yeah also found another interesting

1413.9 --> 1416.5
little game

1418.059 --> 1422.299
Newgrounds has better stuff than I

1420.2 --> 1425.539
thought it did

1422.299 --> 1427.8799999999999
but it's because there's so much of it

1425.539 --> 1430.1
like I don't understand anything about

1427.88 --> 1432.0200000000002
that website at all

1430.1 --> 1435.6789999999999
like

1432.02 --> 1437.78
there's just so much stuff on there and

1435.679 --> 1441.0800000000002
some of it's just crap some of it is

1437.78 --> 1443.12
literally there to troll you to click it

1441.08 --> 1444.799
and it's just nothing

1443.12 --> 1449.0
on purpose

1444.799 --> 1452.12
but it does get like yeah you can it

1449.0 --> 1453.98
does have you can't judge it so you can

1452.12 --> 1455.62
basically see when someone think is just

1453.98 --> 1460.46
a troll

1455.62 --> 1463.34
but there's some pretty well made games

1460.46 --> 1465.82
that are like real projects of personal

1463.34 --> 1465.82
love

1467.299 --> 1472.34
games that are on there

1469.7 --> 1474.74
made with great care

1472.34 --> 1477.3799999999999
that work really well

1474.74 --> 1480.38
they're interesting

1477.38 --> 1485.0200000000002
like not because of the graphics but

1480.38 --> 1485.0200000000002
because of well the way it plays

1490.159 --> 1496.5800000000002
that are like in their own way like

1493.46 --> 1498.38
based on what made all their games like

1496.58 --> 1501.9189999999999
from the 90s

1498.38 --> 1504.159
really good ones like the good adventure

1501.919 --> 1504.159
games

1504.38 --> 1508.46
when it was really fun and they just

1506.6 --> 1510.3799999999999
recreated that so there's like some

1508.46 --> 1513.3400000000001
people that really love good games and

1510.38 --> 1513.3400000000001
they just made that

1518.67 --> 1521.92
[Music]

1524.779 --> 1527.32
all right

1527.48 --> 1529.659
thank you

1534.5 --> 1538.159
I'm glad also that the website's still

1536.84 --> 1540.1399999999999
going

1538.159 --> 1543.46
because apparently they are like having

1540.14 --> 1543.46
Financial issues

1554.179 --> 1560.14
all right so that's why I'm also

1556.4 --> 1560.14
advertising a little for them

1561.32 --> 1567.279
because I do kind of appreciate new

1564.679 --> 1567.279
grounds

1574.96 --> 1581.72
and the funny thing is that almost

1578.24 --> 1584.72
everything that is on here is not

1581.72 --> 1585.43
pay to play Garbage

1584.72 --> 1587.9
see

1585.43 --> 1590.96
[Music]

1587.9 --> 1592.88
like I've not come across one of those

1590.96 --> 1596.559
yet

1592.88 --> 1596.5590000000002
so if you've never heard of that

1597.2 --> 1599.98
try it out

1617.72 --> 1622.1000000000001
all right

1620.059 --> 1624.26
by the way there's some real autistic

1622.1 --> 1629.779
weirdos in there too

1624.26 --> 1631.96
so be warned anyway enough linking for

1629.779 --> 1631.96
today

1655.159 --> 1659.2
all right so yeah what have you been up

1657.08 --> 1659.1999999999998
to

1661.039 --> 1664.039
guys

1669.2 --> 1673.82
now just wander off to all these links

1671.779 --> 1676.779
that I've given you and not watch my

1673.82 --> 1676.779
show anymore please

1688.82 --> 1692.1299999999999
[Music]

1694.159 --> 1697.1200000000001
ah

1714.08 --> 1718.34
I'm thinking by the way also yeah I'm

1716.6 --> 1720.6789999999999
probably going to start talking about my

1718.34 --> 1723.6789999999999
freaking sprained back again

1720.679 --> 1726.98
but I do think like there is a reason

1723.679 --> 1729.14
why it is like this

1726.98 --> 1731.72
I don't see like spraining your back

1729.14 --> 1736.0600000000002
even as like a

1731.72 --> 1739.28
design flaw I think that it is also

1736.06 --> 1739.28
[Music]

1739.46 --> 1744.76
well

1740.6 --> 1744.76
a restoration procedure

1761.48 --> 1767.38
all right because yeah it never like

1764.419 --> 1767.38
lasts forever

1767.899 --> 1771.86
right

1769.159 --> 1774.14
but what it does do is kind of like

1771.86 --> 1776.7199999999998
you see

1774.14 --> 1780.44
this is something that's really really

1776.72 --> 1782.659
stood out to me since I I got this

1780.44 --> 1786.0800000000002
little Affliction yesterday

1782.659 --> 1787.8200000000002
I've not had a single

1786.08 --> 1789.26
stomach issue

1787.82 --> 1793.279
not one

1789.26 --> 1795.14
nothing and I drank beers been smoking

1793.279 --> 1797.899
eating

1795.14 --> 1801.26
and normally I always like have weird

1797.899 --> 1803.7199999999998
acid issues minor right do take care of

1801.26 --> 1806.84
it carefully but it just stands out to

1803.72 --> 1808.94
me like since I got this thing it's

1806.84 --> 1811.1
almost like things in my body work

1808.94 --> 1815.779
differently down there

1811.1 --> 1817.8799999999999
maybe because of that happening locally

1815.779 --> 1819.679
I don't know what it is but it's just

1817.88 --> 1821.8400000000001
like

1819.679 --> 1825.2
maybe it's part of the restoration

1821.84 --> 1827.4189999999999
process that this happens

1825.2 --> 1830.96
I mean why would it always happen

1827.419 --> 1833.48
roughly around the same time a year

1830.96 --> 1836.72
to people that get it

1833.48 --> 1839.38
why doesn't it happen at any other point

1836.72 --> 1839.38
typically

1845.36 --> 1852.58
right maybe spraining your back is kind

1847.76 --> 1852.58
of just like getting the flu or a cold

1853.22 --> 1860.3600000000001
and hopefully in that sense

1857.12 --> 1862.82
it's not psychosomatically transferable

1860.36 --> 1864.62
like a call because then I'm really

1862.82 --> 1867.62
sorry because I've really been talking

1864.62 --> 1871.4189999999999
about it a lot today so please don't let

1867.62 --> 1871.4189999999999
it cycle somatically rub off

1882.02 --> 1887.679

1965.6 --> 1972.9399999999998
I mean with a title like that

1968.779 --> 1972.94
I'd expect to get more comments

1974.24 --> 1979.1
I actually hope to get a lot more

1976.52 --> 1981.279
comments but I didn't that's kind of

1979.1 --> 1981.279
weird

1984.5 --> 1987.399
didn't get any

2004.24 --> 2010.72
well maybe that stuff just needs more

2007.179 --> 2013.8400000000001
time to sink in I don't know man maybe

2010.72 --> 2016.72
maybe I have to readjust like

2013.84 --> 2018.9399999999998
oh I think this is all working like even

2016.72 --> 2022.24
what I wrote out maybe that just always

2018.94 --> 2024.519
takes a week or two or the people that

2022.24 --> 2026.14
just watch my show carefully on their

2024.519 --> 2029.2
own pace are the ones that are getting

2026.14 --> 2032.679
it and let and the light ones less

2029.2 --> 2035.0800000000002
well they're more emotional support

2032.679 --> 2038.159
also and of course the reflection board

2035.08 --> 2038.1589999999999
I mean

2039.279 --> 2045.7
but maybe there is a bit of like a kind

2041.98 --> 2048.46
of a dichotomy for polarization between

2045.7 --> 2050.2200000000003
those that that act

2048.46 --> 2053.2
that do

2050.22 --> 2056.859
participate and those that specifically

2053.2 --> 2059.74
study and do not participate

2056.859 --> 2064.419
I've always found myself that if I don't

2059.74 --> 2066.9399999999996
participate and I really zoom in

2064.419 --> 2069.2999999999997
with my analysis that I do actually see

2066.94 --> 2069.3
more

2080.2 --> 2085.1789999999996
I've actually had some occasions even

2083.139 --> 2088.06
through my own show

2085.179 --> 2089.44
where a lot of the time when I'm very

2088.06 --> 2091.48
inspired

2089.44 --> 2094.0
or I really got like his vision that I'm

2091.48 --> 2095.919
trying to translate I'm just talking and

2094.0 --> 2098.08
talking and

2095.919 --> 2100.18
I'm just throwing it out there I don't

2098.08 --> 2102.0989999999997
necessarily always have like full

2100.18 --> 2103.8999999999996
cognition of what it is that's coming

2102.099 --> 2105.82
even through me I'm just I'm just

2103.9 --> 2108.82
translating

2105.82 --> 2111.76
and then afterward it has happened that

2108.82 --> 2113.56
afterward I'm watching it back and I

2111.76 --> 2115.9
don't always watch everything back so

2113.56 --> 2118.24
it's just on occasion when I watch

2115.9 --> 2121.619
something back and it's like I'm talking

2118.24 --> 2121.6189999999997
to myself like

2122.14 --> 2130.18
like why I'm watching me

2125.859 --> 2132.2799999999997
from the teacher the distant past

2130.18 --> 2134.7999999999997
but

2132.28 --> 2137.38
now that I'm watching I'm in another

2134.8 --> 2141.2200000000003
modus in the analysis modus and now I'm

2137.38 --> 2142.96
getting more information through what I

2141.22 --> 2147.06
was talking about

2142.96 --> 2147.06
then when I was talking about it

2147.76 --> 2152.82
and that's like really weird that's a

2150.22 --> 2155.859
weird experience it's like yeah

2152.82 --> 2159.099
so it's almost like I'm talking to

2155.859 --> 2162.839
myself in the future sometimes because

2159.099 --> 2162.839
that's when I'm paying attention

2189.579 --> 2195.52
it's just something that I experience

2192.82 --> 2197.7400000000002
and maybe this is also an artist's thing

2195.52 --> 2199.599
I think that more artists have that

2197.74 --> 2201.8199999999997
effect

2199.599 --> 2204.46
when they get inspired they just do it

2201.82 --> 2206.7400000000002
they don't necessarily understand it

2204.46 --> 2208.66
like they might understand it

2206.74 --> 2211.54
constructively

2208.66 --> 2214.24
but they don't necessarily have

2211.54 --> 2217.119
like the deeper

2214.24 --> 2219.64
oversight and Reflections about it

2217.119 --> 2222.76
because they're just doing it

2219.64 --> 2226.7799999999997
and this happens to me too sometimes

2222.76 --> 2229.2400000000002

2226.78 --> 2232.38

actual freezing days is good for nature

2736.44 --> 2741.94
traumatizing memory from when my parents

2739.839 --> 2744.2799999999997
went skiing when I was a little kid I

2741.94 --> 2746.64
was like five

and after that they like never like they

2759.52 --> 2763.3
always

2760.54 --> 2765.16
or my brother did go like skiing and

2763.3 --> 2766.96
snowboarding and mono skiing and my

2765.16 --> 2768.8799999999997
brother wasn't really into mono skiing

that's a thing apparently it's different

2768.88 --> 2772.839
from snowboarding and

I can't imagine I'm

2908.14 --> 2913.0
but you know Mike saidunich like for me

2910.599 --> 2914.04
I think also like it's just not gonna

2913.0 --> 2918.819
work

2914.04 --> 2921.0
why because I'm a sweater not the piece

2918.819 --> 2924.7
of clothing it's just that I sweat

2921.0 --> 2926.74
typically when I

2924.7 --> 2928.48
like basically really

2926.74 --> 2930.7599999999998
yeah put effort into something

2928.48 --> 2934.079
physically I do that it's like even when

2930.76 --> 2934.079
I go on the bike

2934.119 --> 2940.599
I just put effort in it like and then I

2937.54 --> 2942.52
get sweaty so if I then have like real

2940.599 --> 2944.56
skiing clothes around me that's a

2942.52 --> 2948.0
nightmare dude because I'm gonna sweat

2944.56 --> 2952.359

2976.48 --> 2981.52
an indication I'm I'm like a more of a

2979.24 --> 2983.319
water person and hey it makes sense I

2981.52 --> 2985.78
have Indonesian blood in me and those

2983.319 --> 2986.859
are that's an island

2985.78 --> 2988.78

2986.859 --> 2992.04
those are island people

like the black Tron has this certain way

3458.04 --> 3463.859
of Designing their things okay so I'm

3460.859 --> 3467.64

parts are like

4904.46 --> 4908.6
just kind of

4906.199 --> 4910.879999999999

hey Godzilla by the way yeah

5006.89 --> 5014.26
[Music]

5010.98 --> 5016.54
although you can basically easily avoid

5014.26 --> 5018.76
that issue if you just

5016.54 --> 5021.64
yeah

5018.76 --> 5024.54
if you just put on slippers then you

5021.64 --> 5024.54
don't get that issue

5025.3 --> 5032.860000000001
but some people just insist on walking

5028.48 --> 5036.36
around with their bare feet in the dark

5032.86 --> 5036.36
yeah that's what you get

5037.239 --> 5041.28

here so

5101.86 --> 5104.86
foreign

5127.8 --> 5134.88
teaching the kids to pick up after

5130.84 --> 5134.88
themselves yeah but yeah

5135.1 --> 5140.320000000001
but I mean the best way to do it to

5138.58 --> 5142.36
actually teach the kid

5140.32 --> 5146.44
how serious they should be taking

5142.36 --> 5149.0199999999995
cleaning up their Legos is if

5146.44 --> 5151.178999999999
if they manage to actually step on a

5149.02 --> 5155.46
piece of Legos themselves

5151.179 --> 5155.46
and then experience how much that hurts

5156.639 --> 5160.900000000001
right

5158.199 --> 5163.599999999999
you gotta make them feel it and really

5160.9 --> 5166.0599999999995
get through to them sometimes

5163.6 --> 5168.76
that's how my parents got through to me

5166.06 --> 5171.400000000001
because I was a giant I'd never clean

5168.76 --> 5173.860000000001
anything up I've just have [ __ ] laying

5171.4 --> 5175.48
around all over the place

5173.86 --> 5179.199
until

5175.48 --> 5181.959999999999
yeah I like walked in right into it into

5179.199 --> 5183.46
the dark and then like literally like

bleeding

5183.46 --> 5188.7390000000005
toes and [ __ ]

5185.679 --> 5190.84
then after that it was like okay

5188.739 --> 5193.299999999999
I'm gonna make sure that never happens

5190.84 --> 5196.4800000000005
again to anyone

5193.3 --> 5198.900000000001
and after that point I cleaned up my

5196.48 --> 5198.9

Street Fighter 2 on the Super Nintendo

5487.3 --> 5491.92
didn't have the game myself but it was

5489.28 --> 5494.46
like every a lot of people had it was

5491.92 --> 5494.46
very popular

5511.659 --> 5514.659

foreign

5554.76 --> 5559.3
yeah because if I keep Banning you

5557.38 --> 5560.92
there's probably a very good reason for

5559.3 --> 5563.4400000000005
doing so and then

5560.92 --> 5566.9800000000005
I'm almost inclined to immediately ban

5563.44 --> 5570.48
you just because of that because I don't

5566.98 --> 5570.48
ban anybody without reason

5570.76 --> 5573.959

5690.46 --> 5696.159
hot chase that I know from arcading

5693.82 --> 5699.96
that was I thought it was extremely

5696.159 --> 5699.96
impressive at the time

5700.36 --> 5704.739
so oh but it was like

5702.639 --> 5708.88
amazing what it was able to accomplish

5704.739 --> 5710.739
with its Graphics amazing and yeah I I

5708.88 --> 5712.2390000000005
have that on my computer I can literally

5710.739 --> 5715.419999999999
play that

5712.239 --> 5717.82
it's exactly the same thing exactly the

5715.42 --> 5719.7390000000005
same game as that thing

5717.82 --> 5722.38
now I don't have a steering wheel and

5719.739 --> 5724.299999999999
all that because that that arcade you

5722.38 --> 5726.659000000001
used to have like a steering wheel and

5724.3 --> 5726.659000000001
all that

5726.9 --> 5732.659
and yeah it's still freaking difficult

5729.46 --> 5732.659
just like back then

5737.26 --> 5739.7390000000005
anyway

5752.08 --> 5757.54

wow that is pretty cheap torque AC but

5757.54 --> 5761.76
yeah that's cute and all what

5762.46 --> 5766.02

5766.54 --> 5771.54
to talk about

5768.1 --> 5771.54
on this show typically

5772.06 --> 5776.92
a little glance maybe but yeah I mean

5774.46 --> 5780.1
this has just been like from one

5776.92 --> 5781.84
freaking toy hobby to another and

5780.1 --> 5785.52
yeah that's not what the Flat Earth

5781.84 --> 5785.52
early bird show normally is for

5788.02 --> 5792.179
especially if you start talking prices

5790.12 --> 5796.179
and [ __ ] I mean that's your own personal

5792.179 --> 5796.179
collector's things

couple of thousands

5866.38 --> 5874.4400000000005
to waste on that

5869.199 --> 5874.44
nor any props for some console

5874.48 --> 5881.04
okay

5876.52 --> 5881.040000000001
I'm happy when I can buy food

[Music]

5892.57 --> 5896.86
[Music]

5894.239 --> 5899.678999999999
what do Glovers say about the new moon

5896.86 --> 5901.58
where does it go for three days

5899.679 --> 5903.159

5901.58 --> 5905.32
[Music]

5903.159 --> 5907.299999999999
it's just drowned out

5905.32 --> 5909.0199999999995
you just don't see the shadow part it's

5907.3 --> 5913.659000000001
drowned out

5909.02 --> 5915.6990000000005
[Music]

5913.659 --> 5916.9
right so they just say it's supposed to

5915.699 --> 5919.089999999999
be there

5916.9 --> 5922.12
but you just don't see it

5919.09 --> 5925.12
[Music]

5922.12 --> 5927.76
because like all the light from the sun

5925.12 --> 5930.219
is just drowning it out that's what they

5927.76 --> 5934.12
say it's all horseshit of course but

5930.219 --> 5937.27
that is what they say

5934.12 --> 5944.629
hello by the way seeing star water

5937.27 --> 5944.629000000001

[Music]

6062.46 --> 6067.08
he's also live apparently

6064.739 --> 6070.5599999999995
talking much more about flatter than I

6067.08 --> 6073.199
am we're talking about toys here

6070.56 --> 6077.719
but yeah I know got a bit of a back

6073.199 --> 6077.719
issue so I'm just taking it easy

6078.719 --> 6084.2390000000005
but yeah I've almost

6080.88 --> 6087.06
the show is almost over anyway

6084.239 --> 6090.659
hopefully tomorrow I will be in a better

6087.06 --> 6093.0
condition more focused

6090.659 --> 6095.28
I think we would talk about actually

6093.0 --> 6099.92
talk about Flat Earth again

6095.28 --> 6103.88
or Maps or anything not toys I mean sure

6099.92 --> 6103.88
sometimes it's just fun

6107.34 --> 6114.43
but I mean it's not super educational

6111.13 --> 6114.43
[Music]

6121.679 --> 6124.28
foreign

6141.739 --> 6145.86
