you can see right there but it's a

81.03 --> 91.28
really beautiful day and this yeah

83.94 --> 96.09
beautiful Sunday not windy quite sunny

91.28 --> 98.869
not very moist like the previous days so

96.09 --> 98.869
yeah it's really nice

103.99 --> 122.89999999999999
mm-hmm so I got Tamara Tamara coffee no

111.14 --> 130.039
that's this is green tea yeah

122.9 --> 132.92000000000002
so let's see who's here son monkey 3d

130.039 --> 137.83999999999997
was first like Ohio Missouri bear I'm

132.92 --> 140.72
and a young George Sanford sorry taka

137.84 --> 147.82
Santino yeah good to see you guys and

140.72 --> 147.82
girls let's see

152.92 --> 156.29999999999998
right let me check something

164.95 --> 167.7
right

172.18 --> 182.43900000000002
yeah I'm not even too sure if I'm going

175.0 --> 185.14
to have D&D this afternoon because this

182.439 --> 189.37
was last week so I don't know but anyway

185.14 --> 204.099
I'm still gonna do this show despite so

189.37 --> 210.42000000000002
a Bates 60r MC unicorn Slayer I had some

204.099 --> 216.37
really odd experiences like really odd

210.42 --> 220.599
even for my doing like flashes flashes

216.37 --> 223.18
with a sudden vision with even with

220.599 --> 225.35899999999998
faces and everything that was really

223.18 --> 225.359
weird

227.939 --> 233.799
it could be because of certain type of

230.53 --> 236.379
imagery that I guess because of a game

233.799 --> 240.639
I've been exposing myself to and some of

236.379 --> 243.42999999999998
these imagery maybe having some

240.639 --> 248.40900000000002
correlation with certain entities so

243.43 --> 250.09
they may be trying to seek me out if I'm

248.409 --> 253.75
interested which I'm not

250.09 --> 256.06
they immediately sense that but I don't

253.75 --> 260.01
know there's something weird going on it

256.06 --> 262.449
yeah nothing yeah it's not like I'm

260.01 --> 265.06
affected by it it's like not like I'm

262.449 --> 268.33000000000004
shocked afterward or anything but it was

265.06 --> 271.0
pretty weird to suddenly like it was

268.33 --> 277.96
while I was going to bed and solely just

271.0 --> 278.889
a flash click and I was kind of jarred a

277.96 --> 282.159
bit like shocked

278.889 --> 284.5
because of the suddenness of it and yeah

282.159 --> 286.99
but anyway I don't know why that was

284.5 --> 290.08
there was a lot of buzzing going on in

286.99 --> 293.59000000000003
the night as well or or maybe I was just

290.08 --> 296.099
like really hyped up and sensitive to

293.59 --> 296.099
know what it was

296.54 --> 309.86
but yeah yesterday a blow Buster's that

303.02 --> 317.47999999999996
was pretty heavy stuff and I was very

309.86 --> 319.34000000000003
hyperactive I felt that in retrospect I

317.48 --> 322.01
may have even kind of ruined it because

319.34 --> 323.92999999999995
I interrupted a couple of times like

322.01 --> 326.03
when I really shouldn't have whoo it

323.93 --> 329.35
just was not necessary and it was

326.03 --> 333.34999999999997
annoying as [ __ ] this is so I apologize

329.35 --> 339.17
but yeah I did at least figure that out

333.35 --> 341.0
and then stopped doing that and I wasn't

339.17 --> 342.77000000000004
the only one by the way I guess that

341.0 --> 345.2
everybody was really hyped up it's the

342.77 --> 352.90999999999997
it's the damn trailer man that trailer

345.2 --> 354.65
just it's like man it's like you it's

352.91 --> 356.99
just that trailer is just great

354.65 --> 364.7
this is let's get you ready for action

356.99 --> 367.1
immediately yeah yeah we're fine overall

364.7 --> 370.31
it was like except for the couple of

367.1 --> 373.97
interruptions I was I was dude yeah it

370.31 --> 377.0
was great and I don't know if people

373.97 --> 380.02000000000004
even noticed but I was actually well not

377.0 --> 384.08
that bad anymore but I was kind of drunk

380.02 --> 386.29999999999995
this but it was from beers before that

384.08 --> 391.09999999999997
because it's just like ass crude it's

386.3 --> 393.71000000000004
Saturday and yeah at first I was a bit

391.1 --> 397.19
slurry and John was a little bit worried

393.71 --> 400.72999999999996
about back talk to him over it over

397.19 --> 403.85
discord before that but said now I got

400.73 --> 405.86
it on in control and I did did manage to

403.85 --> 410.45000000000005
get my furballs under control

405.86 --> 412.37
but yeah I did I was did another effect

410.45 --> 415.72999999999996
of alcohol is that I do get less

412.37 --> 419.2
restraint so I was just good and help

415.73 --> 421.78000000000003
myself interrupting a couple of times

419.2 --> 425.0
yeah

421.78 --> 428.59
what Nathan was also a bit interrupted

425.0 --> 434.05
but Nathan was just that's been hyper

428.59 --> 439.06899999999996
like yesterday or Friday was just so

434.05 --> 441.889
hyped up really once went at it a lot

439.069 --> 446.77000000000004
and yesterday too

441.889 --> 452.05
mutt man he was also extremely focused

446.77 --> 455.27
like really focused and I love how he

452.05 --> 459.02000000000004
basically grabbed mine and chocolates

455.27 --> 461.389
argument and then perfected it like

459.02 --> 465.85999999999996
polished it up like really you nicely

461.389 --> 467.719
put I was super impressive I thought so

465.86 --> 470.90000000000003
yeah it was eventually the whole thing

467.719 --> 473.509
was pretty kick ass and you had the

470.9 --> 476.84
Black Swan it's true but even as I said

473.509 --> 478.699
that thing was there before other

476.84 --> 483.5
pictures it's just with this one it

478.699 --> 488.779
becomes much more clear and we can yeah

483.5 --> 491.12
point that where's the horizon where

488.779 --> 493.58
should it be geometrically it's not

491.12 --> 495.469
there see because it's way over there

493.58 --> 498.85999999999996
behind while the observer hide is

495.469 --> 501.699
extremely low so yeah

498.86 --> 501.699
Black Swan

504.42 --> 511.22
although yeah the the problem is with

507.21 --> 513.63
the Black Swan now is that what John

511.22 --> 515.22
righteously so says yeah I'm gonna just

513.63 --> 518.07
freakin repeat this over and over and

515.22 --> 521.7900000000001
over again it's just that I don't tend

518.07 --> 524.13
to like doing that look so even already

521.79 --> 526.5
at this point I am personally getting a

524.13 --> 529.08
little bored with it but it's because

526.5 --> 532.83
because yeah of the repetitiveness of it

529.08 --> 534.6600000000001
I'd like to personally drive into more

532.83 --> 539.1
details about it instead of just

534.66 --> 541.92
repeating the whole thing and I do I

539.1 --> 546.33
have expanded upon my optical slant

541.92 --> 550.26
theory basically and now truly set my

546.33 --> 552.74
ways and I think it's it's just I have a

550.26 --> 560.04
lot of empirical evidence now that

552.74 --> 563.34
correlates very strongly ok so it

560.04 --> 565.11
correlates its causal based empirical

563.34 --> 568.4100000000001
data and it correlates heavily

565.11 --> 571.44
defraction their fraction causes close

568.41 --> 572.18
proximity to a surface including with

571.44 --> 576.45
lights

572.18 --> 581.2199999999999
- cause diffraction god giving it a

576.45 --> 584.5200000000001
nudge like deviates the pathway where it

581.22 --> 587.85
touches and when that happens over a

584.52 --> 592.11
flat surface that causes to nudge and

587.85 --> 594.03
then reflect off because of the yeah the

592.11 --> 596.4
alright that's the horizon effect and

594.03 --> 600.06
beyond it things are reflecting are a

596.4 --> 602.55
reflection not from what is behind it

600.06 --> 604.9799999999999
but that is all concealed nothing can be

602.55 --> 607.74
seen behind behind the horizon point

604.98 --> 609.65
which is at the same level as the

607.74 --> 613.41
horizon point it's about the height

609.65 --> 616.56
because after that point that horizon

613.41 --> 620.01
point there is like a mirror effect that

616.56 --> 622.26
just very gradually increases in height

620.01 --> 624.0
over distance at a very specific linear

622.26 --> 626.22
relation and everything that is

624.0 --> 628.02
underneath it is completely concealed

626.22 --> 632.59
can never be seen not even mirages

628.02 --> 636.71
nothing but

632.59 --> 638.96
the viewer may see things reflected that

636.71 --> 641.6500000000001
surrounds it it may be a part of the

638.96 --> 644.89
ocean before that could be reflected

641.65 --> 649.4
would be that would be looming or a

644.89 --> 652.37
piece the thing that is still within

649.4 --> 654.59
that zone but above it it sticks out of

652.37 --> 656.45
it out of that mirror zone might also be

654.59 --> 658.6700000000001
reflecting there all kinds of things can

656.45 --> 662.1500000000001
happen but anything that is literally

658.67 --> 664.0999999999999
within that then it cut out peace beyond

662.15 --> 667.1
the horizon point for the viewer

664.1 --> 670.25
it cannot be part of any mirages of any

667.1 --> 675.08
reflection of any visual that can be

670.25 --> 679.45
seen by that observer so I am expanding

675.08 --> 679.45
upon this as well

690.92 --> 703.02
right yeah John John is in a bit of a

699.44 --> 708.48
raging moon recently it's it's err it's

703.02 --> 714.029
annoying but yeah I just you know just

708.48 --> 716.37
smack him it's like it's it Street it's

714.029 --> 719.55
almost like street mentality he just

716.37 --> 726.27
gets really rowdy and you just gotta get

719.55 --> 727.77
rowdy back and that's the way I well

726.27 --> 730.9499999999999
that's what I'm doing it's the only way

727.77 --> 732.779
to do it but you got to be right because

730.95 --> 738.51
just gotta be very loud it's not my

732.779 --> 742.47
thing but I can do that to defend myself

738.51 --> 748.3199999999999
basically or to try to create order this

742.47 --> 750.8100000000001
is it doesn't always work though but at

748.32 --> 753.75
least when I do it it's kind of a signal

750.81 --> 756.93
to John like yeah you are really going a

753.75 --> 758.61
bit too far here because I think he just

756.93 --> 760.76
doesn't really notice when he gets like

758.61 --> 760.76
this

770.89 --> 778.78
so anything you guys want to talk about

774.17 --> 778.78
other than John

788.75 --> 792.16
the gravity joke

813.32 --> 822.8900000000001
Yeah right

824.18 --> 827.79
[Music]

831.03 --> 834.4399999999999
ball busters

836.79 --> 841.9599999999999
just to feel I think

838.78 --> 841.9599999999999
[Music]

846.79 --> 849.98
[Music]

856.47 --> 862.11
oh that's an interesting question

859.5 --> 865.29
sir Chico if you have a room with

862.11 --> 869.78
nothing in it you have space if you have

865.29 --> 873.92
no space there's no nothing in that room

869.78 --> 878.6999999999999
yeah yeah well that's two types of space

873.92 --> 882.24
that is space as in having room it's

878.7 --> 885.32
very clever question because room and

882.24 --> 890.22
space both have two different meanings a

885.32 --> 892.71
room is literally a confine but having

890.22 --> 897.57
room is also having space within that

892.71 --> 900.87
room to put things and space is

897.57 --> 905.37
literally speciality but it is also the

900.87 --> 907.17
same thing in room yes that's a that's a

905.37 --> 914.3100000000001
double trick question very clever sir

907.17 --> 918.1999999999999
checker and how would you call something

914.31 --> 921.419
where there is nothing in no space well

918.2 --> 921.4190000000001
[Music]

922.52 --> 932.8199999999999
that's a conceptual question because it

925.53 --> 937.92
doesn't exist if there is no space there

932.82 --> 941.49
like for example the it would be saying

937.92 --> 943.4699999999999
like yeah what is beyond the loop like

941.49 --> 945.99
it connects from east to west right but

943.47 --> 949.5600000000001
what is in between that or nothing

945.99 --> 956.21
because it interconnected there is

949.56 --> 956.2099999999999
nothing outside of the space that exists

960.42 --> 977.79
that's just it there isn't it's not

966.03 --> 979.89
there doesn't exist and I don't know

977.79 --> 985.17
whether if there are some barriers that

979.89 --> 988.68
basically mark the end of this any type

985.17 --> 991.26
of space barrier from the realm or if

988.68 --> 996.5899999999999
simply the loop in all directions

991.26 --> 1000.1
somehow closes it just makes the

996.59 --> 1002.51
existing space self containing and

1000.1 --> 1007.82
literally there is nothing outside of it

1002.51 --> 1009.92
so even spatial wise the design would

1007.82 --> 1013.0100000000001
not have to concern with anything

1009.92 --> 1016.0999999999999
outside of the cone fine because it's

1013.01 --> 1018.38
looping anyway there's no need for any

1016.1 --> 1020.15
barrier with absolute strength or

1018.38 --> 1025.04
anything anything that could confuse

1020.15 --> 1028.19
anyone or make people obsess over it

1025.04 --> 1032.6599999999999
once they find it but if it's all just

1028.19 --> 1038.65
looping there is no space outside of the

1032.66 --> 1038.65
realm if that were to be the case yeah

1039.64 --> 1044.18
it would certainly fix a lot of

1041.93 --> 1047.9
philosophical issues let's just put it

1044.18 --> 1053.1100000000001
like that if yeah if indeed the realm is

1047.9 --> 1053.1100000000001
looping rectangular as I suspected

1075.32 --> 1081.609
hey more colored right away

1078.5 --> 1081.609
[Music]

1088.19 --> 1094.5800000000002
are you talking about beer pandemic what

1100.16 --> 1111.39
is everybody getting a bit silly this

1102.75 --> 1113.58
morning now anyway if anybody else got

1111.39 --> 1116.01
there any more of those types of complex

1113.58 --> 1121.1299999999999
questions I'd love to tackle them you

1116.01 --> 1121.1299999999999
know try me

1127.53 --> 1134.42
[Music]

1128.75 --> 1134.42
how Corona is beer oh god I get it

1134.96 --> 1145.17
yeah that company must be having a

1137.67 --> 1148.22
bummer now like okay who decided to call

1145.17 --> 1151.0500000000002
it our brand that's just freakin great

1148.22 --> 1152.58
now everybody's gonna be in panicky and

1151.05 --> 1161.78
every time they see our beer brand

1152.58 --> 1161.78
they're gonna be like yeah

1164.92 --> 1173.6200000000001
but who do you sue you know because

1170.13 --> 1177.5800000000002
pretty sure it's not exactly what we

1173.62 --> 1181.11
think it is probably engineered and all

1177.58 --> 1184.51
that and look I don't really know even

1181.11 --> 1190.0
what the virus or the supposed virus or

1184.51 --> 1194.07
the ailment is and like how it how it

1190.0 --> 1194.07
exactly strikes so

1199.63 --> 1204.96
you know every time I see like these

1201.91 --> 1208.6000000000001
bigger outbreaks and it's usually in

1204.96 --> 1210.22
third-world countries or yeah however

1208.6 --> 1211.99
that arrives okay I'm not saying that

1210.22 --> 1214.39
actually arrives naturally I'm just

1211.99 --> 1217.8700000000001
saying once it starts spreading you know

1214.39 --> 1221.0490000000002
in a way it almost becomes obvious at

1217.87 --> 1223.84
least to me that it is rather because

1221.049 --> 1229.03
just the the general poor condition or

1223.84 --> 1231.4289999999999
bad morality among those people that

1229.03 --> 1233.1589999999999
make them all subject that makes a

1231.429 --> 1236.5900000000001
certain region extremely vulnerable

1233.159 --> 1238.7800000000002
especially like compact cities and slums

1236.59 --> 1241.6
yeah of course they're all demoralized

1238.78 --> 1244.08
in certain ways they have poor hygiene

1241.6 --> 1247.1789999999999
and all that so yeah they're gonna have

1244.08 --> 1252.4289999999999
much more complications from any type of

1247.179 --> 1257.38
situation sudden impact diseases sudden

1252.429 --> 1259.3600000000001
waves so yeah like is it really

1257.38 --> 1262.8700000000001
something we should be worried about so

1259.36 --> 1267.07
badly or is it just another cold you

1262.87 --> 1269.26
know really and yeah of course all the

1267.07 --> 1271.0
symptoms it's super extreme is you're

1269.26 --> 1274.75
these people in suits and everything and

1271.0 --> 1277.87
I don't know it just feels a bit like

1274.75 --> 1279.82
the whole nuke situation to me you know

1277.87 --> 1284.35
every time those they bring out those

1279.82 --> 1289.36
hazmat suits it's like really is it

1284.35 --> 1291.52
really that necessary or could you just

1289.36 --> 1296.049
give these people really good

1291.52 --> 1299.83
supplements and proper psychosomatic

1296.049 --> 1302.11
training to know how to basically keep

1299.83 --> 1303.9399999999998
them protected so they don't get it I

1302.11 --> 1306.4289999999999
think that I think it works you know I

1303.94 --> 1308.409
think that works I'd be willing to

1306.429 --> 1310.51
almost test it I'm not saying like oh

1308.409 --> 1312.13
I'm going to go in some diseased region

1310.51 --> 1314.11
or something to try it out I'm just

1312.13 --> 1317.6200000000001
saying like hey if it that arrives I'm

1314.11 --> 1320.9799999999998
gonna trust on that I'll be praying and

1317.62 --> 1323.26
then not be subjected to fear at any

1320.98 --> 1325.9
point like even if I realize like oh

1323.26 --> 1328.48
wait I may suddenly be realizing that

1325.9 --> 1332.01
this person may have it I'm just gonna

1328.48 --> 1335.669
be like oh that's fine and

1332.01 --> 1339.48
I'd be relying upon my general health

1335.669 --> 1341.64
and all that and supplements may be it

1339.48 --> 1343.65
might be afterward go like okay maybe

1341.64 --> 1349.14
I'll take a couple of drops a colloidal

1343.65 --> 1370.3500000000001
silver or some extra vitamin C and then

1349.14 --> 1372.8090000000002
just let it be labelled a right Ella

1370.35 --> 1375.4099999999999
berry is also very strong vitamin C

1372.809 --> 1375.41
sorcerer

1393.559 --> 1403.4089999999999
is China still a third-world country

1396.62 --> 1408.4799999999998
said Jacob well first off China is huge

1403.409 --> 1410.88
it's the most population densities in

1408.48 --> 1415.25
the world probably egg with size and all

1410.88 --> 1420.1390000000001
it's huge so lots of people there and

1415.25 --> 1424.309
you betcha that it's not all poor okay

1420.139 --> 1428.8799999999999
definitely not but there they have some

1424.309 --> 1437.57
poor regions oh yeah oh yes they do

1428.88 --> 1441.029
big-time still so yeah they still have

1437.57 --> 1444.87
regions that could be compared to third

1441.029 --> 1447.269
world conditions you know and then the

1444.87 --> 1450.4189999999999
culture added on top doesn't exactly

1447.269 --> 1454.049
help just letting people ignoring people

1450.419 --> 1455.73
in that have problems or even had

1454.049 --> 1460.1689999999999
accidents that kind of thing like the

1455.73 --> 1464.3990000000001
apathy they have that - it's weird it's

1460.169 --> 1467.039
a bit freaky but yeah that doesn't help

1464.399 --> 1471.87
either you know it's not good for morale

1467.039 --> 1475.83
really and yeah so you they definitely

1471.87 --> 1477.539
have the conditions for heavy plague

1475.83 --> 1480.84
spreading because of it because

1477.539 --> 1486.12
basically morale and yeah not

1480.84 --> 1489.529
everybody's wealthy enough to to keep

1486.12 --> 1494.2689999999998
all their systems up to peak of course

1489.529 --> 1494.269
they're all just struggling to get by

1495.96 --> 1500.91
[Music]

1497.63 --> 1508.0500000000002
and yeah happy indoctrination doesn't

1500.91 --> 1509.8200000000002
help morale either so a 2.5 world

1508.05 --> 1511.83
country that's that's a good one that's

1509.82 --> 1514.71
funny said check oh I'm just saying like

1511.83 --> 1517.98
not it's not everywhere you know there

1514.71 --> 1522.54
man there are some bloody wealthy

1517.98 --> 1526.14
Chinese out there it's crazy they are

1522.54 --> 1530.07
rising up among the most rich people in

1526.14 --> 1533.46
the world absolutely but there's a lot

1530.07 --> 1537.59
of Chinese so there's also a lot of poor

1533.46 --> 1537.5900000000001
people still you know

1541.92 --> 1544.79
anyway

1556.6 --> 1564.74
yeah the other client I know they own

1560.75 --> 1567.08
Hollywood well they have certainly

1564.74 --> 1570.92
invested a lot in Hollywood that is just

1567.08 --> 1574.87
true and you they have censorship

1570.92 --> 1578.75
influence on productions because of it

1574.87 --> 1583.1
so they have basically set their their

1578.75 --> 1589.31
aims on it to manipulate and that's just

1583.1 --> 1592.6699999999998
true but it doesn't necessarily mean

1589.31 --> 1596.99
that they are a conquering force because

1592.67 --> 1599.96
of course yet they do manipulate with

1596.99 --> 1602.57
the typical stuff but yeah that's not

1599.96 --> 1606.2
necessarily even Hollywood that is just

1602.57 --> 1607.7
the the whole leftist movement and all

1606.2 --> 1611.0
that in the political system and

1607.7 --> 1613.52
everything in lagoons and antifa and

1611.0 --> 1615.59
Hollywood is just adding on top of that

1613.52 --> 1617.6
they're not really the leaders although

1615.59 --> 1619.28
you could think of them as such and

1617.6 --> 1623.7099999999998
that's typically a function that

1619.28 --> 1626.6299999999999
Hollywood rises to in any occasion

1623.71 --> 1629.8400000000001
they'd like to be the frontman it's just

1626.63 --> 1630.94
like their job even though it might make

1629.84 --> 1637.1899999999998
no sense

1630.94 --> 1639.89
they're very mercenary at it really and

1637.19 --> 1642.5
they always have been really well for

1639.89 --> 1644.45
good and for bad this is yeah that's

1642.5 --> 1647.62
just how they function it's that it's

1644.45 --> 1653.77
like the actor way the neutral eight

1647.62 --> 1658.6699999999998
yeah but yeah the influence is

1653.77 --> 1661.18
definitely there and China also the on

1658.67 --> 1661.18
Disney

1661.19 --> 1672.3790000000001
oh yeah that South Park episode that was

1667.039 --> 1675.529
a hardcore man yep that was that was

1672.379 --> 1682.849
very hardcore I I understand that China

1675.529 --> 1685.879
get pissed off is it's brutal it is

1682.849 --> 1692.059
something that America would have done

1685.879 --> 1693.799
like 30 40 years ago maybe if they if

1692.059 --> 1697.039
that was the plan

1693.799 --> 1699.619
it's like it is a propaganda way of

1697.039 --> 1702.229
representing even though yeah literally

1699.619 --> 1705.4399999999998
such situations in which could actually

1702.229 --> 1707.96
be transpiring it's it's fit yeah they

1705.44 --> 1717.409
get the regime gets extremely brutal on

1707.96 --> 1720.489
their dissidents as they see it yeah and

1717.409 --> 1720.489
we need a poo

1727.99 --> 1734.35
so yeah that that whole episode was

1731.05 --> 1736.54
absolutely in opposition of what China

1734.35 --> 1740.11
would want so yeah it's no surprise that

1736.54 --> 1746.8899999999999
they would lash out at South Park for

1740.11 --> 1749.9289999999999
that but I was very ballsy of him

1746.89 --> 1749.929
[Music]

1750.75 --> 1757.81
typical South Park really right sorry -

1755.98 --> 1761.14
cousin - you know in a way it is fear

1757.81 --> 1764.32
porn that's the thing it that's why I

1761.14 --> 1766.3000000000002
said it it's it is a dramatization it is

1764.32 --> 1769.71
kind of in a propaganda setting with the

1766.3 --> 1773.6399999999999
music and over emphasizing certain

1769.71 --> 1778.69
issues putting it in a certain light

1773.64 --> 1782.41
yeah but that doesn't mean that you know

1778.69 --> 1789.28
that it's complete fabrication that's

1782.41 --> 1790.21
the issue anyway let's move on to

1789.28 --> 1795.06
another subject

1790.21 --> 1795.06
pretty pretty heavy stuff

1800.02 --> 1803.16
[Music]

1818.61 --> 1828.0
I asked a lone question above the

1822.81 --> 1829.9199999999998
quality like refract whenever it travels

1828.0 --> 1837.39
at an angle into a substance with

1829.92 --> 1841.0700000000002
different refractive index right well

1837.39 --> 1844.5
that is that is like the medium

1841.07 --> 1845.8799999999999
refraction and in normal gas within the

1844.5 --> 1849.27
same medium it's going to be

1845.88 --> 1852.24
insignificant but if for example you

1849.27 --> 1855.45
pass the light passes or the sight

1852.24 --> 1858.3
passes through a an aquarium filled with

1855.45 --> 1861.8700000000001
water well that's much denser and it has

1858.3 --> 1863.6699999999998
a much heavier refractive index so it's

1861.87 --> 1865.4699999999998
going to deviate the path of the light

1863.67 --> 1870.42
but pretty much in a straight line and

1865.47 --> 1873.54
then undo that corner when it moves out

1870.42 --> 1875.67
of the aquarium back into the normal

1873.54 --> 1883.02
it's very odd how that works

1875.67 --> 1885.21
it's just refractive index but that

1883.02 --> 1888.21
doesn't really happen in the atmosphere

1885.21 --> 1891.77
that only happens in heavy substances

1888.21 --> 1891.77
that are still transparent

1903.41 --> 1910.0400000000002
Yeah right but mark Collard what

1905.92 --> 1916.0
refraction basically does is blur things

1910.04 --> 1920.03
up what it diffuses pathways rather than

1916.0 --> 1922.52
specific direction that any directional

1920.03 --> 1926.66
effect is caused by diffraction it is a

1922.52 --> 1934.25
specific interaction process with with

1926.66 --> 1936.92
the material because refraction it it

1934.25 --> 1939.77
basically it's random so it can go in

1936.92 --> 1943.48
any direction of course certain layers

1939.77 --> 1947.77
may then kind of set the ways and even

1943.48 --> 1949.97
yeah create weird reflection like layers

1947.77 --> 1952.76
like their own type of diffraction

1949.97 --> 1958.01
effect it's all how it works it's very

1952.76 --> 1962.51
very complex but refraction in general

1958.01 --> 1966.62
within a homogeneous medium it yeah it's

1962.51 --> 1969.95
in significantly influenced in in an air

1966.62 --> 1974.1699999999998
paced medium right because in the in

1969.95 --> 1974.17
water or anything it's much stronger

1975.73 --> 1981.98
that's by the way also why literally you

1979.25 --> 1986.69
cannot see as far in water as you can

1981.98 --> 1990.32
see in air the lack of air clarity or in

1986.69 --> 1992.3
this case water clarity or it can even

1990.32 --> 1995.24
be very clear water it's still going to

1992.3 --> 1996.8
be an issue the clarity you can see that

1995.24 --> 1998.36
for you things are gonna get blurred up

1996.8 --> 2001.24
at a certain point because of refraction

1998.36 --> 2003.6999999999998
because it just blurs up that is what

2001.24 --> 2009.25
refraction does it blurs things up

2003.7 --> 2013.44
really that doesn't cause the horizon it

2009.25 --> 2013.44
causes the limited view

2014.23 --> 2023.299
diffraction is what causes the horizon

2016.88 --> 2026.14
and it is an interaction process with

2023.299 --> 2026.1399999999999
surfaces

2028.33 --> 2031.3899999999999
[Music]

2043.34 --> 2048.61
that's ridiculous more color that that

2045.889 --> 2048.6099999999997
doesn't make any sense

2055.38 --> 2064.05
that's not how refraction works I

2059.39 --> 2067.77
already explained that refraction it

2064.05 --> 2070.2000000000003
goes into a medium a different medium it

2067.77 --> 2072.63
goes into it then it changes angle and

2070.2 --> 2075.3599999999997
then when it exits it it restores the

2072.63 --> 2079.65
original angle but from another position

2075.36 --> 2082.92
that is how it works it does not they

2079.65 --> 2085.2000000000003
have but it doesn't continue bending

2082.92 --> 2088.2000000000003
within the same medium that that's not

2085.2 --> 2090.39
how refraction works it just deviates

2088.2 --> 2095.1299999999997
its pathway within it and then when it

2090.39 --> 2098.4
acts it it it changes to the medium it

2095.13 --> 2100.35
then borders and then it exits into it

2098.4 --> 2109.26
can bend within the same medium that

2100.35 --> 2111.63
doesn't make any sense and effectively

2109.26 --> 2118.23
over distance it also blurs things up so

2111.63 --> 2121.83
that just doesn't work this is if there

2118.23 --> 2126.66
was that much that heavy refraction that

2121.83 --> 2130.08
would turn so badly around right it

2126.66 --> 2134.19
would effectively cause you to not see

2130.08 --> 2137.22
that far ever so it is contradictive we

2134.19 --> 2139.86
you have to kind of imagine it is

2137.22 --> 2143.43
bending that far and then you use this

2139.86 --> 2145.77
false version of refraction overlooking

2143.43 --> 2147.7799999999997
that actual heavy refraction that would

2145.77 --> 2149.58
make it possible in your mind to

2147.78 --> 2151.9500000000003
potentially bend it around a bow and

2149.58 --> 2154.35
make it look flat actually in reality

2151.95 --> 2158.06
causes things to blur up and you not

2154.35 --> 2162.14
seeing that picture it's a paradox

2158.06 --> 2165.47
you've created a paradox for yourself

2162.14 --> 2165.47
isn't that hilarious

2169.579 --> 2176.73
because actual refraction blurs things

2172.44 --> 2178.89
up if it is heavy if it is not happy

2176.73 --> 2186.14
then there is little blur and you can

2178.89 --> 2190.44
see further it doesn't bend light around

2186.14 --> 2207.749
in in an arc that's not how it works

2190.44 --> 2210.66
right more colored I would I wasn't you

2207.749 --> 2213.18
you put it in quotes I wasn't saying

2210.66 --> 2216.18
yeah yeah you were very careful well

2213.18 --> 2217.499
done mark colored I know it was obvious

2216.18 --> 2221.4199999999996
that you were quoting something else

2217.499 --> 2224.1899999999996
that that wasn't your personal opinion

2221.42 --> 2227.94
but that made it even more worth it for

2224.19 --> 2231.059
me to actually respond to the content of

2227.94 --> 2235.4700000000003
it since it did bring up terrestrial

2231.059 --> 2238.71
refraction and that imagination how it's

2235.47 --> 2239.759
supposed to bend around a ball and that

2238.71 --> 2242.64
just doesn't work

2239.759 --> 2246.93
that's not how refraction or refraction

2242.64 --> 2249.989
indexes work when entering the medium a

2246.93 --> 2254.19
new medium that is transparent the new

2249.989 --> 2256.71
refraction index will cause a notch in

2254.19 --> 2259.589
the direction of the light pathway and

2256.71 --> 2262.38
then will go in a straight line until it

2259.589 --> 2264.3289999999997
exits that medium again and then

2262.38 --> 2266.7000000000003
whatever new medium it's gonna go into

2264.329 --> 2269.579
if it is also transparent it will adapt

2266.7 --> 2272.1899999999996
its angle to that refraction index so

2269.579 --> 2274.5890000000004
alter its path again it doesn't go in a

2272.19 --> 2278.9700000000003
curved path within the same medium

2274.589 --> 2283.339
that's not how that works and the

2278.97 --> 2286.6499999999996
stronger overall yeah refraction is

2283.339 --> 2289.65
through all the mediums combined the

2286.65 --> 2292.079
more the light will diffuse effectively

2289.65 --> 2295.529
blurring up what is visible in the

2292.079 --> 2299.42
background that is what actual optics

2295.529 --> 2299.42
based refraction does

2314.32 --> 2317.8590000000004
[Music]

2321.89 --> 2331.239
[Music]

2337.78 --> 2343.94
while stone monkey 3d if there is a

2341.42 --> 2346.54
continually varying medium if there's an

2343.94 --> 2349.52
irregular medium that's simply gonna

2346.54 --> 2357.46
cascade the whole thing cause total

2349.52 --> 2357.46
warping effectively also blurring it up

2358.6 --> 2367.8199999999997
so it doesn't really matter if there is

2362.68 --> 2371.24
significant deviation if yeah if the

2367.82 --> 2374.48
range of the mediums density for example

2371.24 --> 2377.45
is not uniform but it is at some point

2374.48 --> 2379.04
very thin and at other points less thin

2377.45 --> 2382.48
or more moisture moist

2379.04 --> 2386.5099999999998
yeah then there is going to be some

2382.48 --> 2388.64
irregular blurring because of that it's

2386.51 --> 2391.9700000000003
just going to be some but if the whole

2388.64 --> 2395.27
range of the thing is much thicker much

2391.97 --> 2396.83
more riddled with moist or if it is for

2395.27 --> 2402.28
example water an entirely different

2396.83 --> 2402.2799999999997
medium then that blurring will be much

2404.2 --> 2408.5
yeah in a different way it won't be a

2406.61 --> 2410.54
little blurring like things in the in

2408.5 --> 2415.09
the far distance it will just blur

2410.54 --> 2415.09
everything causing you to not see as far

2416.95 --> 2422.6899999999996
because the refraction the overall

2419.66 --> 2424.73
refraction is stronger causing more blur

2422.69 --> 2429.83
there causing a slight causing

2424.73 --> 2432.36
deviations but the blur also eventually

2429.83 --> 2435.61
is what the result of it will be

2432.36 --> 2435.61
[Music]

2448.059 --> 2451.059
ridiculous

2454.58 --> 2460.19
atmospheric refraction ooh

2457.38 --> 2460.19
sure

2479.7 --> 2482.7
right

2510.74 --> 2518.27
all right stallion 1812 okay I guess I

2514.91 --> 2520.0099999999998
did bring up nukes before are they real

2518.27 --> 2530.69
or are they fake well I'm pretty sure

2520.01 --> 2534.5800000000004
they're fake but despite that despite

2530.69 --> 2536.84
that doesn't mean that they they

2534.58 --> 2542.99
military-industrial complex has not

2536.84 --> 2547.1000000000004
devised just ways to basically have

2542.99 --> 2551.5699999999997
bombs that are as big pretty sure

2547.1 --> 2555.38
they've upped the scale at it so yeah it

2551.57 --> 2558.11
may not be as ultra destructive as they

2555.38 --> 2560.6600000000003
made the nukes out to be but yeah when

2558.11 --> 2563.9900000000002
when the [ __ ] really hits the fan and

2560.66 --> 2567.14
like the big the big devices are brought

2563.99 --> 2569.3799999999997
out you bet that it's gonna be just as

2567.14 --> 2569.3799999999997
bad

2572.77 --> 2580.5099999999998
there will be huge holes in the ground

2577.119 --> 2584.44
where one cities were if that sort of

2580.51 --> 2587.1400000000003
thing will happen ever it might not be

2584.44 --> 2590.56
nukes but it it will be just as bad as

2587.14 --> 2594.5499999999997
it practically the big freaking hole so

2590.56 --> 2598.0
let's not let's not be too happy about

2594.55 --> 2601.84
nukes not being real because it's

2598.0 --> 2604.23
basically just a cover story damage can

2601.84 --> 2604.23
be done

2673.57 --> 2679.63
no there's just people out there that

2676.04 --> 2679.63
are never gonna accept it ever

2686.06 --> 2691.109
[Music]

2702.49 --> 2713.49
right sorry to Cosentino yeah that's

2708.75 --> 2713.49
maybe yeah I don't know

2723.49 --> 2730.18
I hope not let's just say it like that

2725.819 --> 2734.619
but yeah it it could happen but who's to

2730.18 --> 2738.6699999999996
say it is gonna happen quickly you know

2734.619 --> 2740.55
in a way I think almost that if this

2738.67 --> 2744.25
kind of thing is really gonna happen

2740.55 --> 2749.6800000000003
it's like everybody will know it and not

2744.25 --> 2753.96
know how to stop it because they're all

2749.68 --> 2767.9199999999996
part of it like that you know it's like

2753.96 --> 2770.589
it's not this type of situation yeah I

2767.92 --> 2773.559
need I think you need to stop bringing

2770.589 --> 2777.0299999999997
that up satvinder loud it's very

2773.559 --> 2777.03

kicked out or band or just timed out

2831.44 --> 2843.15
please continue to bring up the subject

2834.15 --> 2843.599
that I didn't want you to do so it's not

2843.15 --> 2851.809
funny

2843.599 --> 2851.809
oh okay well that case and then

2862.38 --> 2865.619
[Music]

2878.6 --> 2885.47
ah right what are they talking about

2881.65 --> 2888.4100000000003
fiery Cataclysm right yeah I don't know

2885.47 --> 2892.7
I don't think I don't necessarily think

2888.41 --> 2894.74
it's gonna happen anytime soon as I said

2892.7 --> 2900.8199999999997
yeah I think I finished that train of

2894.74 --> 2900.8199999999997
thought anything else

2922.2 --> 2934.1699999999996
okay yeah I don't know that but maybe

2931.92 --> 2941.31
I'll bump into it at some point sorry -

2934.17 --> 2944.04
sorry - Cosentino but look personally i

2941.31 --> 2947.61
have not made up my mind about all the

2944.04 --> 2953.7799999999997
things that are even part of it all you

2947.61 --> 2956.28
know I go by the actions and by the

2953.78 --> 2960.36
principles of Jesus Christ within the

2956.28 --> 2963.6600000000003
whole thing but as for what the visions

2960.36 --> 2968.7000000000003
were of the individuals are their

2963.66 --> 2970.8599999999997
communications with God I have to just

2968.7 --> 2973.74
puzzle it out because I personally think

2970.86 --> 2976.32
that a lot of it could dad basically be

2973.74 --> 2978.6899999999996
metaphorical a be not in the physical

2976.32 --> 2981.1200000000003
world experience it could be yeah like a

2978.69 --> 2983.39
vision so it's going to be if they

2981.12 --> 2992.45
literally went through like the

2983.39 --> 2996.48
physiological process then that has some

2992.45 --> 2998.5499999999997
technical consequences for what the

2996.48 --> 3002.2
experience will be like it's like the

2998.55 --> 3006.67
setting it's the the medium would be set

3002.2 --> 3010.49
so and yet it's a big puzzle for me and

3006.67 --> 3017.4500000000003
yeah what is physically literal and what

3010.49 --> 3020.5699999999997
is metaphorical prayerfully I'll get to

3017.45 --> 3023.81
it I'm not saying that that it is all

3020.57 --> 3026.0
metaphor I don't know maybe it parts

3023.81 --> 3030.0499999999997
just literally say like no this is

3026.0 --> 3032.48
literally going to happen but it all

3030.05 --> 3035.92
depends on ya when that's the whole

3032.48 --> 3041.27
thing about future situations you know

3035.92 --> 3043.55
it becomes very complex as to what that

3041.27 --> 3047.78
means because if like the meaning is too

3043.55 --> 3053.75
specific then it it's like a paradox it

3047.78 --> 3055.52
will undo it or it would be self created

3053.75 --> 3059.99
by somebody choosing

3055.52 --> 3062.33
do that self-fulfilling prophecy as it

3059.99 --> 3066.68
were that technically anyone could do

3062.33 --> 3068.93
that but it was sort of this is well no

3066.68 --> 3072.23
I guess with the Bible it would require

3068.93 --> 3073.8199999999997
a lot of power and control but maybe

3072.23 --> 3079.19
that is more what the prediction was

3073.82 --> 3081.56
about it's just the natural effects that

3079.19 --> 3085.16
humans will be subjected to in group

3081.56 --> 3087.74
base as more control and power arrives

3085.16 --> 3089.54
what will be the response from the ego

3087.74 --> 3091.64
how things will crystallize what the

3089.54 --> 3098.7799999999997
decisions will typically turn out to

3091.64 --> 3101.08
become but that's yeah it's complex

3098.78 --> 3101.0800000000004
stuff

3117.4 --> 3124.87
that your chamfered Russian say oil

3120.12 --> 3128.7999999999997
reproduces itself yeah well they're

3124.87 --> 3132.46
probably right I've heard that oil and

3128.8 --> 3136.0
the deep oil is actually created by some

3132.46 --> 3139.9900000000002
kind of bacteria that under high

3136.0 --> 3143.05
pressure eat dissolve rock and turn it

3139.99 --> 3148.12
into a biotic oil and they just keep on

3143.05 --> 3151.8700000000003
going and so when oils oil wells have

3148.12 --> 3154.18
filled up and they're drained they just

3151.87 --> 3158.0499999999997
start to produce more eat more rock and

3154.18 --> 3160.54
turn it into more oil so yeah I wouldn't

3158.05 --> 3162.55
be surprised at all it's funny if they

3160.54 --> 3174.1
would kind of be more open about

3162.55 --> 3176.4300000000003
admitting it now what's peak oil Martin

3174.1 --> 3184.36
Ellen well peak oil is basically a

3176.43 --> 3188.94
period when a lot of oil wells have like

3184.36 --> 3192.61
been laid to rest for a time and then

3188.94 --> 3194.26
everybody returns and everything's

3192.61 --> 3196.3
filled back up and everybody starts

3194.26 --> 3198.7000000000003
producing at all these new wells that

3196.3 --> 3201.19
you don't need to dig for it first so

3198.7 --> 3203.0499999999997
it's then suddenly a lot of oil arrives

3201.19 --> 3208.06
really cheaply with little investment

3203.05 --> 3210.92
and that causes Peak Oil that is really

3208.06 --> 3214.119
what causes Peak Oil

3210.92 --> 3214.119
[Music]

3215.8 --> 3221.02
that's not every of course there's other

3218.5 --> 3223.3
influences as well but it's it's gonna

3221.02 --> 3227.5
be a factor because the more oil wells

3223.3 --> 3231.55
are drilled events you lead the more oil

3227.5 --> 3243.07
output there will be over time at a

3231.55 --> 3249.07
persistent level no oil is not made the

3243.07 --> 3251.65
energems okay well it it kind of is the

3249.07 --> 3255.34
bacteria make it so

3251.65 --> 3257.5
oil oil wells when they've stopped being

3255.34 --> 3262.42
used because there's not enough oil

3257.5 --> 3267.07
pressure anymore they yeah they just

3262.42 --> 3269.05
refill after a time it's like okay let's

3267.07 --> 3271.6600000000003
open the tap back up and it just starts

3269.05 --> 3274.0
pouring out because the pressures built

3271.66 --> 3278.71
back up because there's it's refilled

3274.0 --> 3280.84
with oil so yeah it does do that it does

3278.71 --> 3282.31
take some time so it's not like oh next

3280.84 --> 3285.19
day it's all filled back up now of

3282.31 --> 3288.97
course not but it takes a couple of

3285.19 --> 3291.01
years but eventually they do fill back

3288.97 --> 3293.31
up no it's not utter nonsense there's

3291.01 --> 3297.2200000000003
been reports of that all over the place

3293.31 --> 3300.34
it happens because it's not freakin

3297.22 --> 3305.7599999999998
rotted dinosaurs that turn into oil in

3300.34 --> 3305.76
all or swamps that's all nonsense

3306.39 --> 3316.8599999999997
now it's bacteria eating away at rock at

3310.87 --> 3316.8599999999997
high pressure and that create oil

3332.46 --> 3339.78
I don't have any reports at hand Fiona

3335.55 --> 3342.96
James I look this is this was really

3339.78 --> 3346.23
basically a passing thing it's like okay

3342.96 --> 3347.82
realization because I've been hearing

3346.23 --> 3350.34
all over the place and it's not like

3347.82 --> 3353.76
reports it's just it's something that's

3350.34 --> 3355.32
been going around they just tell like

3353.76 --> 3358.13
it's something that's been dropped in

3355.32 --> 3361.71
media and look if that wasn't the case

3358.13 --> 3364.32
then people would be widely complaining

3361.71 --> 3366.78
about it saying like look we had this

3364.32 --> 3368.61
oil well here it's been abandoned for 20

3366.78 --> 3372.42
years I just checked no there's nothing

3368.61 --> 3377.25
there no there's just people saying yeah

3372.42 --> 3377.82
yeah yeah it's great fill back up back

3377.25 --> 3381.96
to business

3377.82 --> 3384.51
yeah because does that I'm pretty sure

3381.96 --> 3387.39
otherwise I figure it out there would be

3384.51 --> 3389.61
a big backlash it would be it would turn

3387.39 --> 3391.5299999999997
out to be a foolish rumor that everybody

3389.61 --> 3394.9
would say now that's nonsense it doesn't

3391.53 --> 3398.0190000000002
happen no it does happen

3394.9 --> 3398.0190000000002
[Music]

3412.42 --> 3418.04
well conspiracy theorist you know that's

3415.94 --> 3420.44
very preliminary I don't think there's

3418.04 --> 3422.63
enough need for preliminary theorizing

3420.44 --> 3425.42
anymore because the Internet has been

3422.63 --> 3428.03
here for a while so I would rather now

3425.42 --> 3433.31
designate it as conspiracy fact checker

3428.03 --> 3435.23
how about that how about you know I

3433.31 --> 3438.5
wouldn't mind being called a conspiracy

3435.23 --> 3440.96
fact checker because pretty sure there

3438.5 --> 3443.51
are conspiracies there's an established

3440.96 --> 3446.17
admitted conspiracies there's a

3443.51 --> 3449.6000000000004
conspiracy still staring us in the face

3446.17 --> 3456.34
some of us some of it very arrogantly

3449.6 --> 3459.41
and yeah so it's more about checking

3456.34 --> 3463.1000000000004
which are rumors in which are real ways

3459.41 --> 3465.35
because there is rumors but yeah we've

3463.1 --> 3468.5
become more adapted to recognize them in

3465.35 --> 3471.7999999999997
the preliminary stage and other things

3468.5 --> 3474.23
are just real and you know now much

3471.8 --> 3478.3700000000003
better after a long period of getting

3474.23 --> 3480.41
into this or I do at least and so just

3478.37 --> 3482.81
figure out you were figuring out what is

3480.41 --> 3486.2799999999997
a rumor and what can definitely turn out

3482.81 --> 3488.57
to be real and you just pay attention

3486.28 --> 3490.8500000000004
because these things come out much

3488.57 --> 3493.79
quicker now people are not so hesitant

3490.85 --> 3495.77
anymore to step forward in response to

3493.79 --> 3498.68
these types of things like 10 years ago

3495.77 --> 3505.55
yes remember 10 years ago people were

3498.68 --> 3508.58
very hesitant in general to call in the

3505.55 --> 3514.01
show conspiracy show they will keep it

3508.58 --> 3516.5
superficial and nowadays no there's just

3514.01 --> 3518.3
people engaging with this type of thing

3516.5 --> 3521.06
all over the place with all kinds of

3518.3 --> 3523.04
subjects so it's a different setting now

3521.06 --> 3525.46
the culture has shifted the general

3523.04 --> 3525.46
culture

3527.04 --> 3530.23
[Music]

3538.249 --> 3542.8689999999997
so yeah conspiracy fact checker

3555.769 --> 3564.4489999999996
radiation-related cancer right and but

3560.88 --> 3567.719
yeah I'm not saying that like actual

3564.449 --> 3572.509
radiation right it's very specific that

3567.719 --> 3572.509
that cannot absolutely damage the body I

3572.989 --> 3579.359
don't think that radiation is completely

3576.029 --> 3581.729
fake it is just not exactly what they

3579.359 --> 3584.8489999999997
say it is it is more like a poison that

3581.729 --> 3590.4289999999996
works in a very odd way compared to

3584.849 --> 3592.469
other things but radiation externally it

3590.429 --> 3595.14
all depends like yeah the intensity if

3592.469 --> 3597.599
you have super heavy radiation yeah of

3595.14 --> 3603.1189999999997
course it's gonna literally fry the

3597.599 --> 3604.799
cells and kind of have the same weight

3603.119 --> 3610.489
just because of the sheer intensity but

3604.799 --> 3613.049
that but just basic level exposure what

3610.489 --> 3617.729
officially would be considered slightly

3613.049 --> 3620.249
and safe yeah if we constantly get

3617.729 --> 3623.279
exposed to that level constantly then

3620.249 --> 3625.6189999999997
eventually there may be like a critical

3623.279 --> 3628.999
mass but it like there is influence it's

3625.619 --> 3628.9990000000003
just not as severe

3634.84 --> 3646.28
and it really depends on the type of

3637.52 --> 3649.7
substance because for example plutonium

3646.28 --> 3654.26
right that whatever you think about its

3649.7 --> 3658.66
radioactive qualities it is extremely

3654.26 --> 3667.25
poisonous like really deadly poison so

3658.66 --> 3669.8599999999997
that is just what that is so I'd say

3667.25 --> 3674.06
that any potential radioactive things

3669.86 --> 3676.84
about it are just secondary because it's

3674.06 --> 3676.84
just very poisonous

3683.79 --> 3688.29
right but all of this is about

3685.53 --> 3692.57
radioactivity and all that and it's a

3688.29 --> 3692.57
complex issue complex issue but that

3693.05 --> 3700.32
doesn't really equate to concept of

3696.57 --> 3703.26
nukes it's not because that part is

3700.32 --> 3705.0
fiction like the worst you could do with

3703.26 --> 3707.76
it is have dirty bombs and that's pretty

3705.0 --> 3716.07
disgusting it's big but it's just a

3707.76 --> 3718.32
poison bomb basically but a real nuke

3716.07 --> 3721.2000000000003
like a giant explosion from a relatively

3718.32 --> 3725.01
little device no pretty sure that

3721.2 --> 3726.93
doesn't happen not in that way anyway

3725.01 --> 3733.4
you know who knows what they've devised

3726.93 --> 3736.77
since then what the cover story

3733.4 --> 3738.53
nuclear fission pretty sure that's just

3736.77 --> 3742.159
fake

3738.53 --> 3742.159
[Music]

3754.13 --> 3761.569
well seeking the truth weren't those

3758.15 --> 3763.5190000000002
people were they subjected to external

3761.569 --> 3769.089
radiation or were they literally

3763.519 --> 3769.089
injected with radioactive substances

3769.18 --> 3779.3799999999997
because again those up many of those

3772.309 --> 3783.6400000000003
substances are poisonous so how exactly

3779.38 --> 3783.6400000000003
how exactly did that work

3789.68 --> 3792.7999999999997
[Music]

3812.64 --> 3818.7799999999997
nooks are just an open nuclear reactor

3815.61 --> 3823.6800000000003
no no that's not what nukes are at all

3818.78 --> 3825.78
cam shake 1 2 3 not at all no it's not

3823.68 --> 3830.58
just like a nuclear reactors just

3825.78 --> 3833.76
regular what the material does it heats

3830.58 --> 3835.7999999999997
up things exactly that works yeah the

3833.76 --> 3838.9500000000003
material itself may be changing in the

3835.8 --> 3841.2000000000003
process so it's local radiation but

3838.95 --> 3847.02
that's not what nukes do no nukes are

3841.2 --> 3849.93
said to be that process magnified so

3847.02 --> 3853.17
that a presumed cascade effect a

3849.93 --> 3858.12
critical mass they call it what happened

3853.17 --> 3861.42
causing a chain reaction and like mega

3858.12 --> 3863.94
fission instant like everything all

3861.42 --> 3866.91
fission's up that's what they claim that

3863.94 --> 3884.3
is and that there's no proof of that

3866.91 --> 3884.2999999999997
that that can even happen every bare

3885.96 --> 3892.18
well the atom definition it's not

3890.29 --> 3894.04
necessarily that which cannot be split

3892.18 --> 3896.5789999999997
it's just that which cannot be split

3894.04 --> 3901.42
without changing the entire nature of it

3896.579 --> 3909.599
because atoms can alter but then they

3901.42 --> 3909.599
change and so do molecules of course

3918.11 --> 3921.2290000000003
[Music]

3925.16 --> 3931.02
what do you think

3927.12 --> 3931.92
a Geiger come to countermeasures it

3931.02 --> 3937.05
measures

3931.92 --> 3939.39
well radiation it's just that there is

3937.05 --> 3946.65
radiation pretty much everywhere is it

3939.39 --> 3949.2599999999998
it's a normal thing so yeah it does

3946.65 --> 3950.88
register things it is a way to detect if

3949.26 --> 3952.7700000000004
something is there but that doesn't

3950.88 --> 3956.78
automatically mean that it will be as

3952.77 --> 3956.78
dangerous as they say it is

3990.41 --> 3995.75
yes mark colored it seems so it's but it

3993.26 --> 3998.71
is always the same thing look they

3995.75 --> 4003.01
believe in this thing in this mighty

3998.71 --> 4006.7
vision of manmade doom right the atomic

4003.01 --> 4010.09
bomb then may do the danger that we may

4006.7 --> 4015.0699999999997
destroy each other that that vision it's

4010.09 --> 4017.6800000000003
a dark vision they can't they don't like

4015.07 --> 4020.6800000000003
it when people just say no that's made

4017.68 --> 4023.44
of so they do what bothers then do and

4020.68 --> 4024.91
start to deflect off to everything

4023.44 --> 4027.01
they've learned about it and say is that

4024.91 --> 4029.25
not real is that not real is that not

4027.01 --> 4035.0800000000004
real is that not real is that not real

4029.25 --> 4038.89
well avoiding the core as to what is

4035.08 --> 4041.5299999999997
exactly not real about radioactive yeah

4038.89 --> 4043.66
in this in this case just the atomic

4041.53 --> 4046.26
bomb effect the critical mass build-up

4043.66 --> 4049.74
and then the cascade effect causing

4046.26 --> 4056.59
instant fusion of all the set of all the

4049.74 --> 4058.6
the radioactive atoms that that part

4056.59 --> 4062.38
they'll try to avoid they'll try to

4058.6 --> 4065.56
bypass it and just claim but everything

4062.38 --> 4068.4700000000003
else are you saying that is wrong no

4065.56 --> 4071.32
we're not saying that is wrong there may

4068.47 --> 4074.8599999999997
be slight interpretations about the

4071.32 --> 4077.65
influence may be wrong but the process

4074.86 --> 4081.76
isn't necessarily wrong the wrongly

4077.65 --> 4085.56
describes it's just that the suppose it

4081.76 --> 4088.2400000000002
affects the critical mass build-up

4085.56 --> 4091.62
causing the cascade we know yeah as a

4088.24 --> 4094.9599999999996
nuclear fission explosion that that is

4091.62 --> 4097.84
fiction but everything else there are

4094.96 --> 4101.79
still things with that and it it may

4097.84 --> 4105.33
just be overblown how dangerous it is

4101.79 --> 4105.33
it's understood

4106.309 --> 4112.4490000000005
oh wow

4121.29 --> 4129.11
yeah okay yo [ __ ] that this that is

4129.2 --> 4135.45
whatever it is the curvature calculator

4133.56 --> 4139.650000000001
is based on our anyway and there's no

4135.45 --> 4141.66
proof for it so like that little tool

4139.65 --> 4150.57
has been figured out and abandoned a

4141.66 --> 4153.8099999999995
long time ago and besides we have two

4150.57 --> 4164.48
Black Swan now picture of the two oil

4153.81 --> 4164.4800000000005
rigs remember all right

4178.65 --> 4186.23
short video I see text

4194.409 --> 4197.04
right

4197.94 --> 4203.759999999999
all right

4199.81 --> 4207.070000000001
a small-time channel I see 53 sirs that

4203.76 --> 4223.6
seems like a decent video I'll post link

4207.07 --> 4226.5
for people it's just 1/2 minute hey you

4223.6 --> 4226.5
can be by the way

4251.83 --> 4268.25
jorts Sanford that is amazing they

4256.639 --> 4270.7390000000005
thought that's fascinating you yeah I'm

4268.25 --> 4273.44
going into a bit of conspiracy theory

4270.739 --> 4276.739
now in response to that you're Sanford

4273.44 --> 4283.849999999999
he says granddad says nukes are a real

4276.739 --> 4285.65
scene one yet lived 75 years hmm I'm

4283.85 --> 4288.83
just wondering like what that was

4285.65 --> 4291.5
because supposedly the United States did

4288.83 --> 4293.63
subject like soldiers to the flash and

4291.5 --> 4298.94
all that no pretty sure they did see

4293.63 --> 4302.36
that whatever that specifically was so

4298.94 --> 4306.62
I'm just wondering like what were they

4302.36 --> 4309.739
testing were they testing psychosomatic

4306.62 --> 4313.989
effects were they basically showing a

4309.739 --> 4313.989
giant flash like yeah what is it the

4314.02 --> 4319.370000000001
anyway like it you know the type of

4317.719 --> 4322.429
chemical reaction that gives a giant

4319.37 --> 4327.05
flash that stuff just a really huge

4322.429 --> 4330.17
flash and bang and subject them to it

4327.05 --> 4332.63
and then yeah telling them like yeah

4330.17 --> 4337.57
you've been subjected to radiation and

4332.63 --> 4339.62
we're gonna test you and then see if

4337.57 --> 4341.63
yeah if they're having some

4339.62 --> 4344.38
psychosomatic responses because they've

4341.63 --> 4347.2390000000005
been told you're being subjected to this

4344.38 --> 4350.96
because that may have been a secondary

4347.239 --> 4356.87
test about it so see things can get

4350.96 --> 4358.969
really complex like that like if it was

4356.87 --> 4360.7699999999995
fake then why did they even do that were

4358.969 --> 4363.9800000000005
they testing something psychosomatically

4360.77 --> 4368.719
it's it is kind of like wizardry making

4363.98 --> 4371.449
a story real and then seeing if it could

4368.719 --> 4373.01
be done to actually make people give

4371.449 --> 4374.9
themselves the symptoms for

4373.01 --> 4377.360000000001
psychosomatic because they believed it

4374.9 --> 4379.5199999999995
and that would be the perfect cover for

4377.36 --> 4381.86
it being real because there's people

4379.52 --> 4383.4800000000005
actually apparently influenced by it

4381.86 --> 4386.87
even though it wasn't real

4383.48 --> 4387.58
now that is total wizardry indeed Karen

4386.87 --> 4391.22
me

4387.58 --> 4396.41
it's totally down my lane of interest

4391.22 --> 4400.31
and that thing it makes sense it is a

4396.41 --> 4402.44
isn't away cursing making somebody

4400.31 --> 4405.71
believe there's something terrible

4402.44 --> 4408.139999999999
happen or going on with them and then if

4405.71 --> 4414.71
they literally buy a day we'll created

4408.14 --> 4421.79
that's a curse that's what it is and it

4414.71 --> 4424.64
is absolute wizardry and now there may

4421.79 --> 4428.36
be preliminary things to basically nudge

4424.64 --> 4431.39
people into believing it by for like for

4428.36 --> 4434.45
example how easy would it be to just say

4431.39 --> 4437.38
like oh yeah you have to take this in

4434.45 --> 4439.88
order to stave the the symptoms right

4437.38 --> 4441.25
but the thing you're getting is some

4439.88 --> 4444.38
kind of injection your pillow actually

4441.25 --> 4446.27
causes that symptom and well if you

4444.38 --> 4449.92
eventually then believe it and don't

4446.27 --> 4452.570000000001
figure it out yeah you may like

4449.92 --> 4455.21
psychologically settle like yeah my life

4452.57 --> 4457.639999999999
is gonna end I'm gonna change everything

4455.21 --> 4460.55
around and then the spirit may falter

4457.64 --> 4466.27
and actually be convinced like yeah it

4460.55 --> 4469.55
is the end and then the person would

4466.27 --> 4471.92
would reinforce those symptoms even

4469.55 --> 4473.6
afterward they and even if some of the

4471.92 --> 4478.01
symptoms would go away they would still

4473.6 --> 4480.110000000001
believe it and having basically

4478.01 --> 4484.33
rearranged their entire life around it

4480.11 --> 4484.33
yeah well that's a curse

4489.599 --> 4494.139
right and I know there's a lot of

4491.86 --> 4497.199
ballers here in the background that now

4494.139 --> 4500.59
immediately just take everything I just

4497.199 --> 4502.379999999999
said and think yeah that's exactly flat

4500.59 --> 4505.150000000001
earth it's a curse

4502.38 --> 4512.26
you'll rearrange your entire life around

4505.15 --> 4514.509999999999
it and it makes no sense yeah it's funny

4512.26 --> 4517.3
I know how they work I know they'll

4514.51 --> 4518.889
that's just what they do even if they

4517.3 --> 4522.039
don't speak out about it in chat I know

4518.889 --> 4523.53
they will do it but yeah they that's

4522.039 --> 4528.579
because they overlooked what it actually

4523.53 --> 4530.32
does and what helps do clarity it brings

4528.579 --> 4531.67
and all that they can they can't see

4530.32 --> 4534.61
they don't want to see they don't want

4531.67 --> 4536.9400000000005
to know so they just think this anyway I

4534.61 --> 4547.69
did it to myself

4536.94 --> 4550.36
mm-hmm bring that up right Karen B and

4547.69 --> 4555.308999999999
not just that right how about what was

4550.36 --> 4558.039
it the hundreds hundreds and hundreds of

4555.309 --> 4565.21
nuclear tests have been done all over

4558.039 --> 4567.4
the place yeah secret Asian man that's

4565.21 --> 4570.07
fine I know you're afk a lot that's fine

4567.4 --> 4574.379999999999
I still appreciate your streams you know

4570.07 --> 4574.38
you just stream some good stuff yeah

4575.01 --> 4579.3
what is it talking about now I got

4577.119 --> 4579.299999999999
distracted

4581.829 --> 4585.849
damn it forgotten

4599.92 --> 4604.02
yeah I'm pretty sure there are no nukes

4604.12 --> 4611.04
it's wizardry and yeah psychosomatically

4606.73 --> 4614.08
people can be made to believe it and

4611.04 --> 4616.57
those people believing it genuinely will

4614.08 --> 4620.5
be used as an example to perpetuate that

4616.57 --> 4623.009999999999
belief because there is no that there

4620.5 --> 4625.72
would that such a person would not be

4623.01 --> 4628.83
radiating or suppressing the lie that's

4625.72 --> 4633.360000000001
other people could pick up on so people

4628.83 --> 4633.36
could then more easily take debate

4650.69 --> 4653.889999999999
[Music]

4662.3 --> 4670.909000000001
well anyway look here and be dirty bombs

4666.48 --> 4673.259999999999
are basically a concept and like the

4670.909 --> 4679.679
spiritual moral consequence of doing

4673.26 --> 4682.9800000000005
such things is so severe that it's it's

4679.679 --> 4687.329
not generally applied thank God nobody

4682.98 --> 4688.049999999999
will do that it's such a such a terrible

4687.329 --> 4690.57
thing

4688.05 --> 4693.4400000000005
nobody's going to do that literally

4690.57 --> 4693.44
ruins everything

4721.52 --> 4729.67
you know seeking truth my chat is

4724.13 --> 4733.99
basically about three seconds behind you

4729.67 --> 4733.99
might need to refresh your page

4770.82 --> 4774.78
okay well seeking truth that if this is

4773.28 --> 4777.48
really the first time you've heard about

4774.78 --> 4782.2699999999995
in that can happen but it's been brought

4777.48 --> 4785.37
up many many times over the past years

4782.27 --> 4788.64
even before if I II started my own

4785.37 --> 4792.57
channel here so there's dedicated videos

4788.64 --> 4794.67
about it with video examples and

4792.57 --> 4798.0
pointing it out debunking quite

4794.67 --> 4804.63
elaborately Eric debated even videos

4798.0 --> 4811.98
about it what is it David Weiss many

4804.63 --> 4814.14
times Jaron did videos about it a lot of

4811.98 --> 4816.929999999999
big players did very good videos about

4814.14 --> 4819.950000000001
it so I'll just check it out just circle

4816.93 --> 4819.950000000001
search it out

4827.719 --> 4839.9
seeking truth what why and how why well

4835.9 --> 4843.53
it's a propaganda warfare to always it's

4839.9 --> 4846.018999999999
a and it's it's like a bit of a Ponzi

4843.53 --> 4848.3
scheme it's a geopolitical Ponzi scheme

4846.019 --> 4851.229
it's like designated people that have

4848.3 --> 4854.360000000001
nukes and that then have certain

4851.229 --> 4856.76
approaches geopolitically like you have

4854.36 --> 4861.039
to take the nuke seriously even if it is

4856.76 --> 4865.3
fake it's like it it changes the

4861.039 --> 4869.869
designation of a country in the big game

4865.3 --> 4871.88
and it has practical consequences and

4869.869 --> 4875.139
attitudes and what other groups are

4871.88 --> 4878.929
going to do based on their narratives so

4875.139 --> 4883.51
yeah it has in its it's a it's a phantom

4878.929 --> 4886.9890000000005
tool that's why because they can use it

4883.51 --> 4890.059
it just gives the controller more

4886.989 --> 4892.428999999999
ability to control and they have a fear

4890.059 --> 4897.019
porn tool that they can pull out of the

4892.429 --> 4899.079
closet in case of a potential danger as

4897.019 --> 4902.809
it were that kind of thing right or

4899.079 --> 4907.329
whatever and as for how well we

4902.809 --> 4911.38
explained it you fake it you make some

4907.329 --> 4914.179
some CGI set up and your subjects

4911.38 --> 4917.869
basically make it a deal with a country

4914.179 --> 4921.079
like Japan as a peace deal like yeah we

4917.869 --> 4922.848999999999
need you to be we need you to surrender

4921.079 --> 4926.03
they didn't want us to render okay we

4922.849 --> 4929.78
got something then we want to do and you

4926.03 --> 4932.869
have to go with it you gotta say it is

4929.78 --> 4934.88
what we say it is and you will save

4932.869 --> 4937.489
great face because nobody wants to

4934.88 --> 4938.63
oppose a weapon like that so they use it

4937.489 --> 4942.438999999999
okay sure

4938.63 --> 4945.679
so they firebombed vaisakhi and

4942.439 --> 4948.650000000001
hiroshima did the cover story for nukes

4945.679 --> 4949.13
and japan was like yeah yeah we're

4948.65 --> 4951.589999999999
[ __ ]

4949.13 --> 4955.969
we surrender everybody be like woah [ __ ]

4951.59 --> 4959.2390000000005
really nukes okay we all surrender in

4955.969 --> 4961.31
Japan but yeah afterward

4959.239 --> 4962.299999999999
picking up the pieces it's kind of

4961.31 --> 4964.13
different but there's still

4962.3 --> 4965.6900000000005
psychosomatic going on because the

4964.13 --> 4970.54
government did convince their people

4965.69 --> 4973.489
that it was real and there are victims

4970.54 --> 4976.43
there are definitely victims and hade a

4973.489 --> 4978.62
lot of people just were bombed and

4976.43 --> 4984.280000000001
burned to [ __ ] in the first place

4978.62 --> 4987.17
so that's what I think that happened

4984.28 --> 4990.7699999999995
that that's how they did it that's how

4987.17 --> 4995.68
they convinced it into the world they

4990.77 --> 4995.68
made a deal it's like a controlled

4995.71 --> 5004.51
conquering it's like okay we'll you're

5002.32 --> 5007.42
going to surrender right but we are

5004.51 --> 5010.17
giving you an option to surrender in a

5007.42 --> 5013.54
way that'll be more like a win-win

5010.17 --> 5015.79
that's basically it so go with our

5013.54 --> 5019.09
propaganda thingy you go with it and

5015.79 --> 5022.0
then yeah afterwards we'll make it kind

5019.09 --> 5024.04
of worth your while and hey they're kind

5022.0 --> 5027.01
of allies now right Japan in the United

5024.04 --> 5029.68
States so yeah I think that is part of

5027.01 --> 5030.04
the deal originally that's part of that

5029.68 --> 5032.62
deal

5030.04 --> 5035.2
I really think so there's no proof of it

5032.62 --> 5037.59
in a direct sense but it just that is

5035.2 --> 5041.41
the order it's how it transpired and

5037.59 --> 5045.1900000000005
their allies now so you know how many

5041.41 --> 5047.65
countries do you know become allies

5045.19 --> 5052.21
after they've been at war and then

5047.65 --> 5054.3099999999995
suddenly a huge cataclysm or a genocide

5052.21 --> 5056.64
and then they become allies how many

5054.31 --> 5064.150000000001
times that does that happen in history

5056.64 --> 5066.52
you think you know I don't think it

5064.15 --> 5070.75
happens a lot so that is suspect in

5066.52 --> 5079.320000000001
itself but yeah it is what it is and I

5070.75 --> 5079.32
yeah I'm glad you know why not

5081.16 --> 5087.59
in the sense that they're allies that

5083.9 --> 5091.5199999999995
why not yeah the nuke lying cover story

5087.59 --> 5095.95
is what it is but I have no objection to

5091.52 --> 5095.950000000001
the United States and Japan being allies

5098.5 --> 5106.31
that situation is setup certainly did

5101.51 --> 5111.08
spawn a lot of well great cartoon sci-fi

5106.31 --> 5114.68
it helped the the animation revolution

5111.08 --> 5126.1
also in the United States that also has

5114.68 --> 5126.1
open because of that do you understand

5126.67 --> 5133.04
it's like yeah you're going to go with

5129.83 --> 5136.13
us into fooling the people in the cover

5133.04 --> 5138.98
story and then yeah they actually also

5136.13 --> 5144.92
focus on that and they go with typical

5138.98 --> 5147.44
globe story a lot Andy at least the idea

5144.92 --> 5149.72
of nukes and all that and then they help

5147.44 --> 5151.669999999999
insert all that in their media in their

5149.72 --> 5155.63
fantasy products in the science fiction

5151.67 --> 5158.6
in cartoons America did it defended it

5155.63 --> 5162.59
luck and they cooperated because they

5158.6 --> 5166.64
seem to have made this deal after World

5162.59 --> 5169.7
War Two to basically do the similar type

5166.64 --> 5176.72
of things and be cooperative at it and

5169.7 --> 5179.33
competitive of course anyway that's just

5176.72 --> 5183.85
my view on it and I don't know I don't

5179.33 --> 5187.49
mean to insult anyone with that no

5183.85 --> 5189.410000000001
people definitely died when it happened

5187.49 --> 5191.36
in Hiroshima and Iwasaki not denying

5189.41 --> 5195.0199999999995
that know it not saying nobody died it's

5191.36 --> 5197.2699999999995
just saying it's it wasn't an actual

5195.02 --> 5199.790000000001
nuclear explosion because I don't think

5197.27 --> 5201.080000000001
that those are possible I think that's

5199.79 --> 5205.63
impossible

5201.08 --> 5210.26
I think it was regular fire bombing

5205.63 --> 5214.0
which is terrible it's a terrible way

5210.26 --> 5214.0
to end up horrific

5249.539 --> 5256.619
I wonder some time now that it's it's

5254.25 --> 5261.84
kind of weird and it just popped into my

5256.619 --> 5264.808999999999
head we all know right that after World

5261.84 --> 5268.110000000001
War 2 or basically after Germany was

5264.809 --> 5271.59
defeated the Allies went out and did

5268.11 --> 5277.039
huge fire bombings in Germany like

5271.59 --> 5280.639
destroyed whole cities I wonder now if

5277.039 --> 5283.53
they had the option at some point to go

5280.639 --> 5286.17
if it was necessary if Germany for

5283.53 --> 5289.38
example wouldn't surrender after that if

5286.17 --> 5291.059
they would had and I had an option on

5289.38 --> 5294.929
the table to do the same thing as they

5291.059 --> 5299.13
did with Japan and say like ok we can

5294.929 --> 5302.13
say we nuked you Germany how about that

5299.13 --> 5305.579
and then we can do you can get the same

5302.13 --> 5308.400000000001
deal as Japan think about it but I think

5305.579 --> 5311.099
that Germany declined and then it got

5308.4 --> 5314.039
split up Russia happened yeah East

5311.099 --> 5318.03
Germany and all that but I think that

5314.039 --> 5320.88
America probably wanted to put out a

5318.03 --> 5324.32
similar deal with Germany as they did

5320.88 --> 5327.2390000000005
with Japan what do you guys think

5324.32 --> 5330.42
because they did firebomb the [ __ ] out

5327.239 --> 5335.73
of those cities terrible so they could

5330.42 --> 5338.76
have potentially just resorted to

5335.73 --> 5341.909
eventually doing the same thing saying

5338.76 --> 5344.55
yeah we nuke them but guess what they

5341.909 --> 5347.009999999999
didn't do that that's already kind of a

5344.55 --> 5349.219
sign but they also kind of held back

5347.01 --> 5352.1990000000005
that they firebombed the [ __ ] out of him

5349.219 --> 5355.639
so that just goes to say like was that

5352.199 --> 5360.419999999999
fire bombing originally a potential

5355.639 --> 5362.400000000001
story add-on for America nuking Germany

5360.42 --> 5364.9400000000005
and defeating it that way what do you

5362.4 --> 5364.94
guys think

5376.06 --> 5381.64
and and they canceled it they canceled

5379.3 --> 5384.1900000000005
doing that because it wasn't gonna work

5381.64 --> 5387.96
out politically Germany wasn't gonna go

5384.19 --> 5391.0599999999995
with it maybe Russia didn't stand for it

5387.96 --> 5395.76
they would they yeah they wanted they

5391.06 --> 5395.76
wanted East Germany

5400.63 --> 5407.17
at Geoffrey Bill you don't even know

5402.55 --> 5409.54
what EMP weapons are really I understand

5407.17 --> 5411.76
the concept I've talked about it but I

5409.54 --> 5413.0199999999995
you don't know have you ever seen it

5411.76 --> 5416.62
have you ever done it

5413.02 --> 5418.330000000001
it's just story it's technology science

5416.62 --> 5422.44
fiction as far as I'm concerned I

5418.33 --> 5424.24
haven't seen a demonstration ever now

5422.44 --> 5428.3099999999995
it's gonna be slightly difficult to

5424.24 --> 5430.599999999999
record a demonstration since that camera

5428.31 --> 5433.18
is probably also going to be subjected

5430.6 --> 5435.22
to the same effect so how do you yeah

5433.18 --> 5436.990000000001
you have to basically see it live

5435.22 --> 5440.05
demonstration and are you going to be

5436.99 --> 5442.66
tricked it's tough but I've just never

5440.05 --> 5444.7
seen it I've never seen empirical proof

5442.66 --> 5447.4
that EMP weapons are real either

5444.7 --> 5450.25
and the original idea was basically

5447.4 --> 5454.0599999999995
spawned from nukes in the first place it

5450.25 --> 5456.42
was supposedly the side effect first all

5454.06 --> 5459.070000000001
the electronics go out from the flash

5456.42 --> 5463.63
the communications would go down and

5459.07 --> 5468.69
then yeah remember that was that was the

5463.63 --> 5471.9400000000005
EMP idea that would come from news so

5468.69 --> 5475.66
that's where that ideas palms from from

5471.94 --> 5479.62
a theoretical construct right so is

5475.66 --> 5481.42
there any real EMP I don't know because

5479.62 --> 5484.57
as far as I'm concerned it spawned from

5481.42 --> 5492.1900000000005
the concept of nuclear fission explosion

5484.57 --> 5494.41
so I don't know I don't know guys but

5492.19 --> 5496.179999999999
who knows maybe maybe does exist I don't

5494.41 --> 5499.72
know but I've never seen anything like

5496.18 --> 5502.59
that convinced me at this point that

5499.72 --> 5502.59
that it's real

5536.27 --> 5543.92
Noorie true seeker radiation poisoning

5539.29 --> 5548.39
are you sure or was it nuclear

5543.92 --> 5553.52
contamination as in the substance I was

5548.39 --> 5556.18
he what kind of radiation poisoning are

5553.52 --> 5556.18
you talking about

5563.01 --> 5571.29
like I can imagine that if you for

5567.45 --> 5574.7699999999995
example breathe dust that is yeah

5571.29 --> 5578.13
radioactive poisonous yeah that can

5574.77 --> 5582.3
cause damage probably if it is the

5578.13 --> 5586.32
poisonous tide and then radiation

5582.3 --> 5588.18
secondary effects typically it all

5586.32 --> 5592.259999999999
depends if it's if you just supposedly

5588.18 --> 5595.200000000001
solve the flesh from a nuke that's I

5592.26 --> 5596.91
don't think that does anything in it I

5595.2 --> 5600.65
don't even think there is a flash of a

5596.91 --> 5600.65
nuke it's probably something else

5602.15 --> 5606.469999999999
it's probably just magnesium

5619.59 --> 5627.2
all right anyway yeah go for a second

5624.2 --> 5627.2
yeah

5629.74 --> 5633.07
I'll be back

5733.219 --> 5739.33
a tank

5740.01 --> 5743.06
[Music]

5799.75 --> 5808.73
well George Sanford they fake them to

5805.28 --> 5811.869
control the messes in fear it just heat

5808.73 --> 5815.54
well there's other reasons for it too

5811.869 --> 5817.969
like if radioactivity like if these

5815.54 --> 5820.01
specific because I think that uranium

5817.969 --> 5823.04
and all that it is it does do that it is

5820.01 --> 5826.900000000001
a unique material they also just don't

5823.04 --> 5829.489
want us that substance to get blown up I

5826.9 --> 5833.65
think that is also an important reason

5829.489 --> 5837.0199999999995
it's just like it is pretty precious

5833.65 --> 5839.36
don't blow it up and if they didn't

5837.02 --> 5841.25
designate it as extremely dangerous and

5839.36 --> 5844.969
like oh if somebody attacked that that

5841.25 --> 5846.949
is just that's like one of the worst

5844.969 --> 5848.54
things somebody could do is like total

5846.949 --> 5851.089999999999
evil and as long as there's an

5848.54 --> 5854.57
understanding then yeah may be more

5851.09 --> 5858.400000000001
inclined to leave that thing alone to to

5854.57 --> 5858.4
not cause as much Cataclysm

5863.23 --> 5869.629999999999
as for ya suppose that nuclear meltdowns

5867.2 --> 5872.83
I don't even know exactly if that is

5869.63 --> 5876.56
real as well I don't know I don't know I

5872.83 --> 5879.89
don't know what that is does that happen

5876.56 --> 5881.75
does the heat cause it to melt basically

5879.89 --> 5883.46
does that really happen what is the what

5881.75 --> 5888.28
is the consequence is there basically

5883.46 --> 5890.63
toxic vapors come on is that the danger

5888.28 --> 5894.44
attack I can imagine that could be

5890.63 --> 5898.49
pretty dangerous if it is so heated by

5894.44 --> 5901.389999999999
itself that it will start to slightly

5898.49 --> 5905.99
evaporate in the open air and then cause

5901.39 --> 5907.820000000001
basically vapor of that substance to

5905.99 --> 5915.76
start swarming around that would be

5907.82 --> 5923.11
extremely toxic I don't know but yeah I

5915.76 --> 5926.4800000000005
just don't know but at least yeah I

5923.11 --> 5928.5199999999995
think that the substance that they use

5926.48 --> 5930.849999999999
in actual in those plants is pretty

5928.52 --> 5930.85
precious

5950.67 --> 5957.93
that no no that's not true

5954.93 --> 5959.51
cam shake one two three that's not what

5957.93 --> 5963.09
happens

5959.51 --> 5963.780000000001
Inu cabins no that doesn't happen never

5963.09 --> 5967.2
happens

5963.78 --> 5969.179999999999
you know what does happen though is and

5967.2 --> 5974.19
this is kind of admitted is that

5969.18 --> 5977.85
hydrogen can start to form and build up

5974.19 --> 5982.91
and then basically be sparked into

5977.85 --> 5985.110000000001
exploding so yeah that can absolutely

5982.91 --> 5987.78
explosions can happen but it's not a

5985.11 --> 5991.589999999999
nuclear explosion it's a hydrogen gas

5987.78 --> 5993.75
explosion that's what happened in

5991.59 --> 5999.05
Fukushima as well that that's what those

5993.75 --> 5999.05
explosions were hydrogen build-up boom I

6003.49 --> 6010.5199999999995
remember that I saw that when it

6006.65 --> 6012.5599999999995
happened I was right on top of it on

6010.52 --> 6014.06
Alex Jones of course and he showed a lot

6012.56 --> 6015.950000000001
of footage I didn't

6014.06 --> 6018.89
of course fear pore and spiraling out of

6015.95 --> 6021.74
control but I did get exposed by the

6018.89 --> 6027.410000000001
actual footages and all that it wasn't

6021.74 --> 6034.16
dug into that exploit it released this

6027.41 --> 6036.7699999999995
radiation no no it doesn't release

6034.16 --> 6041.18
radiation like that what it does release

6036.77 --> 6042.38
however is well dust because if there's

6041.18 --> 6044.3
going to be explosion there's going to

6042.38 --> 6045.86
be evaporation it's going to be

6044.3 --> 6048.29
displacement yeah there's going to be

6045.86 --> 6051.74
probably uranium dust or whatever the

6048.29 --> 6054.56
substance is that's gonna in the

6051.74 --> 6056.3
explosion have some powder and gas

6054.56 --> 6061.01
basically be blown around a little

6056.3 --> 6064.06
that's toxic potentially but there's not

6061.01 --> 6064.06
a radiation

6073.109 --> 6080.519
oh really well there's so much radiation

6076.05 --> 6084.719
in Chernobyl comes it 1 2 3 so much of

6080.519 --> 6087.149
it that at this time it is almost like a

6084.719 --> 6089.189
nature resort there because the wild

6087.149 --> 6091.769
animals have pulled into the town taking

6089.189 --> 6094.05
it over and the grass is all great and

6091.769 --> 6096.749
there's still some people that just

6094.05 --> 6100.859
refuse to leave that live there and live

6096.749 --> 6103.949
like in paradise literally it's like a

6100.859 --> 6106.979
small paradise because people avoid it

6103.949 --> 6110.178999999999
like hell in general people are not just

6106.979 --> 6112.619000000001
gonna wander in except for like ooh

6110.179 --> 6114.149
thrill-seeking tourists that think it's

6112.619 --> 6116.549999999999
dangerous and they're gonna risk it or

6114.149 --> 6121.169000000001
something but there's just people living

6116.55 --> 6125.909000000001
there all this time so yeah there's no

6121.169 --> 6127.889
radiation no and whatever radiation is

6125.909 --> 6130.228999999999
there is not apparently not dangerous

6127.889 --> 6134.78
because it's just full of life full of

6130.229 --> 6140.869000000001
it is flourishing like nothing else and

6134.78 --> 6140.869
it's been widely recorded on video

6145.66 --> 6150.86
hundreds of people lived there again now

6147.8 --> 6153.43
yeah well I bet you know was bound to

6150.86 --> 6156.44
happen unfortunately it's gonna go back

6153.43 --> 6157.76
probably to the way it was and I wonder

6156.44 --> 6161.239
if at some point they're just gonna

6157.76 --> 6163.16
shrub the entire story out of the out of

6161.239 --> 6166.16
the books and just say like now there

6163.16 --> 6167.0599999999995
was just a disaster and some poison

6166.16 --> 6169.79
there's something

6167.06 --> 6171.4400000000005
yeah people live there again and they're

6169.79 --> 6173.96
gonna leave the radiation nonsense

6171.44 --> 6175.82
stories about ten thousands years of

6173.96 --> 6177.71
livable it's all gonna die they're

6175.82 --> 6179.299999999999
probably just gonna drop that from the

6177.71 --> 6182.75
books eventually they just say no it was

6179.3 --> 6188.06
just an industrial accident because why

6182.75 --> 6191.03
would down bees are lively did they like

6188.06 --> 6193.370000000001
scoop out all the soil and filter out

6191.03 --> 6195.0199999999995
the radio did they do that no they just

6193.37 --> 6199.2699999999995
left it as it is and it's all

6195.02 --> 6199.27
flourishing so

6225.08 --> 6227.86
right

6232.159 --> 6239.549999999999
yeah Jeffrey bill well one thing that I

6235.469 --> 6244.2300000000005
am curious at is how procreation goes

6239.55 --> 6246.92
there because that would really be the

6244.23 --> 6251.218999999999
biggest test like if there is still

6246.92 --> 6254.429
active radioactivity and that would not

6251.219 --> 6256.17
be dangerous to to regular people I

6254.429 --> 6258.179
guess they there are some would

6256.17 --> 6262.08
absolutely survive it without even

6258.179 --> 6264.33
having symptoms but it's generally known

6262.08 --> 6266.699
with radioactivity of all kinds that

6264.33 --> 6268.89
children's infants and especially the

6266.699 --> 6275.79
unborn are extra sensitive to it they

6268.89 --> 6278.01
are so it will show like if people are

6275.79 --> 6280.199
going to live there again and they're

6278.01 --> 6282.81
just gonna suddenly start families and

6280.199 --> 6285.928999999999
eat often the land there and all that

6282.81 --> 6287.76
not import everything it will show it

6285.929 --> 6291.21
will show if there will be birth defects

6287.76 --> 6293.25
but it will be yeah more poison based

6291.21 --> 6297.29
because they're getting substances that

6293.25 --> 6301.44
are not killing the plants or whatever

6297.29 --> 6303.35
it just hypothetically they could people

6301.44 --> 6305.669999999999
could make it but if they would have

6303.35 --> 6308.400000000001
fetuses inside them if somebody was

6305.67 --> 6313.76
pregnant and then that might then cause

6308.4 --> 6318.9
the damage specifically to that infant I

6313.76 --> 6321.0
don't know I don't know I know but if

6318.9 --> 6323.94
yeah hundreds of people if they're again

6321.0 --> 6326.94
they might have already there may

6323.94 --> 6332.4
already been some babies out there so

6326.94 --> 6334.199
who knows that eat yellow cake for

6332.4 --> 6336.71
dessert I wouldn't recommend it's not

6334.199 --> 6336.71
very tasty

6342.37 --> 6345.54
[Music]

6362.59 --> 6368.02
yeah who knows you know about Fukushima

6365.25 --> 6371.23
well the problem with Fukushima of

6368.02 --> 6374.740000000001
course was that the entire city was

6371.23 --> 6379.719999999999
completely trashed by the flood by the

6374.74 --> 6382.84
tidal wave but who knows at some point

6379.72 --> 6386.2
people are just gonna say yeah whatever

6382.84 --> 6388.78
and they're just gonna kind of rebuild

6386.2 --> 6391.72
the town slowly it's gonna be mostly a

6388.78 --> 6394.45
junk pile for a while probably because

6391.72 --> 6396.490000000001
but who knows and I think there's a I

6394.45 --> 6399.5199999999995
think even now there's already people

6396.49 --> 6403.45
living there and they had first problems

6399.52 --> 6407.64
with milk because the cows that yeah

6403.45 --> 6414.75
we're there they'd have this problem

6407.64 --> 6417.7300000000005
apparently look I'm pretty sure that

6414.75 --> 6422.22
because of the hydrogen explosions in

6417.73 --> 6425.53
those power plants literal rods of

6422.22 --> 6429.43
uranium and all that did actually launch

6425.53 --> 6432.82
in all directions and left yeah rubbed

6429.43 --> 6434.740000000001
off a lot of dust and all that so I

6432.82 --> 6437.759999999999
wouldn't be surprised if the area is

6434.74 --> 6437.76
kind of toxic

6444.159 --> 6452.04
but yeah who knows maybe in 30 years or

6447.639 --> 6454.659000000001
so it'll be just like Chernobyl is now

6452.04 --> 6456.51
it'd just be like people picked up the

6454.659 --> 6459.489
pieces again they're like yeah whatever

6456.51 --> 6461.38
we're just gonna do what do we do and

6459.489 --> 6463.75
hey this is a great place a great

6461.38 --> 6466.6
opportunity for government to stay out

6463.75 --> 6468.82
of our business and for people to stay

6466.6 --> 6474.1900000000005
away because they're all afraid who

6468.82 --> 6480.04
knows now I'm not gonna bring up another

6474.19 --> 6483.75
subject now Jeffrey bill thanks so I'm

6480.04 --> 6483.75
gonna run out to show and not too long

6529.299 --> 6543.069
Wow well Jeffrey bill they're doing it

6535.51 --> 6545.019
to themselves if that is the case if

6543.069 --> 6550.179
you're gonna literally make everything

6545.019 --> 6552.159000000001
just a signal bouncing room and get all

6550.179 --> 6554.279
the green away everything yeah it's

6552.159 --> 6558.369
gonna be hell if they want to do that

6554.279 --> 6560.859
then I would probably rather go live in

6558.369 --> 6564.369
Chernobyl than in Hamburg if they're

6560.859 --> 6566.289000000001
literally doing all that and yeah the

6564.369 --> 6568.719
people that actually go with that and

6566.289 --> 6573.789
even go chopping down the trees that

6568.719 --> 6578.109
decided upon them I I wouldn't want to

6573.789 --> 6581.499
be them and I'm having trouble not

6578.109 --> 6586.959000000001
actually overstepping the boundaries of

6581.499 --> 6590.169
what I should do because safe to say I

6586.959 --> 6594.159
don't appreciate people that make that

6590.169 --> 6599.969
kind of decisions and I'd rather see

6594.159 --> 6599.969
them get what they deserve because of it

6614.6 --> 6623.320000000001
all right

6616.38 --> 6627.16
well then don't use it or just hey if

6623.32 --> 6630.099999999999
you're a 5g user just stay the freak

6627.16 --> 6632.11
away from the woods if you want all the

6630.1 --> 6634.63
hyper Internet [ __ ] yeah then you're

6632.11 --> 6637.96
gonna have to be in the city just go sit

6634.63 --> 6641.35
on your internet hub or whatever you

6637.96 --> 6643.42
wanna go out there oh yeah you want to

6641.35 --> 6645.79
go out to the woods because it's nice oh

6643.42 --> 6646.6900000000005
you can't get any reception oh oh they

6645.79 --> 6648.43
figured out they can't have any

6646.69 --> 6649.78
reception because of the wood so now

6648.43 --> 6652.06
they're gonna chop down the wood so you

6649.78 --> 6654.21
don't have any woods to go to in order

6652.06 --> 6657.04
to complain about not getting a signal

6654.21 --> 6661.6
how about that how about you just stayed

6657.04 --> 6665.8
a freak away from the woods if you were

6661.6 --> 6669.18
such a 5g fan just go sit in in your

6665.8 --> 6669.18
city box and stay there

6683.42 --> 6691.49
I don't understand why why anyone

6687.95 --> 6694.3099999999995
thought it was a good idea to 5ki like

6691.49 --> 6696.46
the function of it of it why would you

6694.31 --> 6696.46
do that

6697.21 --> 6705.8
it's basically not too different from

6701.27 --> 6711.05
just Wi-Fi why would you standardize

6705.8 --> 6719.24
this [ __ ] it's the worst idea ever see

6711.05 --> 6720.070000000001
useless it confines the user do you

6719.24 --> 6722.87
understand

6720.07 --> 6724.969999999999
remember the mobile how amazing it was

6722.87 --> 6728.72
oh my god I can have a mobile I don't

6724.97 --> 6730.46
have to sit in a chair at home to talk

6728.72 --> 6732.26
to somebody I can actually walk around

6730.46 --> 6733.76
and know sometimes connections and then

6732.26 --> 6737.45
got better connection look it could get

6733.76 --> 6741.2
almost everywhere and now they're gonna

6737.45 --> 6744.47
do the 5g so you lose that freedom for

6741.2 --> 6746.42
what for what for something you could

6744.47 --> 6748.45
get with a landline at your computer

6746.42 --> 6754.09
you're going to be confined again

6748.45 --> 6754.09
because of 5g it's the dumbest decision

6754.36 --> 6763.67
for the users of it ever dumbest

6759.64 --> 6765.9800000000005
technological thing ever should be

6763.67 --> 6768.38
completely wiped off the table not even

6765.98 --> 6772.339999999999
because of potential risks which are

6768.38 --> 6775.400000000001
kind of overblown I think but just

6772.34 --> 6779.650000000001
because it is stupid it is a stupid

6775.4 --> 6783.429999999999
system it is completely useless

6779.65 --> 6786.4
completely useless

6783.43 --> 6789.91
[Music]

6786.4 --> 6793.42
5g is the worst it's useless nobody

6789.91 --> 6796.15
needs it if you want some hyper mega

6793.42 --> 6799.0
internet stream you wanna download all

6796.15 --> 6800.49
that [ __ ] to do it on a freaking

6799.0 --> 6803.68
landline

6800.49 --> 6808.03
stop being a whiner about something you

6803.68 --> 6817.51
don't need nobody needs this technology

6808.03 --> 6820.21
nobody 4G is more than enough more than

6817.51 --> 6825.22
enough it's not enough for you well then

6820.21 --> 6828.15
go sit and a freakin desktop it's

6825.22 --> 6828.150000000001
cheaper anyway

6839.12 --> 6842.48
it's like really you're gonna change

6841.07 --> 6845.69
everything you're gonna change the

6842.48 --> 6848.8099999999995
dependency foundation of your mobile

6845.69 --> 6851.96
device to something where you're going

6848.81 --> 6857.0
to be regional now again confined again

6851.96 --> 6861.47
you're gonna do that because you want it

6857.0 --> 6863.9
faster so if you're okay with confining

6861.47 --> 6865.67
yourself just to get a little faster why

6863.9 --> 6867.889999999999
don't you just confine yourself with a

6865.67 --> 6871.4
lined land a landline

6867.89 --> 6875.87
it's much easier you don't have to then

6871.4 --> 6881.2699999999995
restrict yourself per default by using

6875.87 --> 6884.12
this completely useless technology it's

6881.27 --> 6887.3
dumb everything about it is dumb the

6884.12 --> 6891.29
people that forwarded this should all be

6887.3 --> 6894.04
smacked in the face seriously it's the

6891.29 --> 6897.41
worst it's diverse from an technological

6894.04 --> 6900.86
environmental everything about it is bad

6897.41 --> 6905.99
it's the worst stop it stop the useless

6900.86 --> 6909.259999999999
technology [ __ ] we don't need it we got

6905.99 --> 6913.88
enough stop pushing

6909.26 --> 6916.280000000001
superfluous [ __ ] on the people nobody

6913.88 --> 6920.96
cares if mindless drones will take

6916.28 --> 6924.44
anything nobody wants this only idiots

6920.96 --> 6927.87
and [ __ ] and money grubbers want

6924.44 --> 6932.5

6927.87 --> 6932.5
[Music]

6934.42 --> 6941.68
so you got your 5g rent didn't want to

6939.32 --> 6941.679999999999
go there

6946.42 --> 6949.45
shut up

6954.01 --> 6957.18
[Music]

6965.28 --> 6971.539
just use a landline there there it works

6971.599 --> 6983.07
it's cheap it has no negative side

6978.389 --> 6987.57
effects it's very very fast very fast

6983.07 --> 6992.159
insanely fast landlines these days like

6987.57 --> 6995.28
I have like a basic basic internet thing

6992.159 --> 6998.789
and getting on the side and I can

6995.28 --> 7002.749
download stuff movies whatever if I have

6998.789 --> 7005.449
the opportunity with five megabytes per

7002.749 --> 7008.42
second and that's like the ultimate

7005.449 --> 7010.428999999999
minimal basic default package and it

7008.42 --> 7014.829
literally doesn't cost me anything

7010.429 --> 7018.38
because I'm writing along with that why

7014.829 --> 7021.978999999999
would you have to why would you go forth

7018.38 --> 7024.139
5g on some freaking mobile when you can

7021.979 --> 7026.96
get a cheap-ass connection and just pump

7024.139 --> 7030.92
any data you want if you want that data

7026.96 --> 7032.659
on your mobile you just forward it to

7030.92 --> 7036.229
your mobile put it on there in some

7032.659 --> 7038.598999999999
memory disk if you really want to watch

7036.229 --> 7044.59
movies on earlier or whatever that are

7038.599 --> 7044.59
gonna take up all this space just

7047.32 --> 7054.53
and besides why does everything with one

7051.23 --> 7057.61
click has to be instant instant fluidity

7054.53 --> 7061.28
it's like oh you want to watch a video

7057.61 --> 7065.96
just click on it have it load for like

7061.28 --> 7070.4
10 20 seconds and you can just watch the

7065.96 --> 7073.01
video you don't need that instant click

7070.4 --> 7077.5
it's working knows not a second delay

7073.01 --> 7082.1900000000005
that is for retards that is for spoiled

7077.5 --> 7085.73
stupid idiots nobody actually needs that

7082.19 --> 7089.839999999999
it's useless it's completely useless

7085.73 --> 7091.12
only serves to help this fake fantasy

7089.84 --> 7093.92
about how everybody's also

7091.12 --> 7095.9
technologically superior and so you can

7093.92 --> 7101.62
get let yourself go more be more

7095.9 --> 7104.87
arrogant brag more and [ __ ] and just

7101.62 --> 7109.97
waste your time more because you can

7104.87 --> 7113.18
more quickly waste your time on the

7109.97 --> 7118.360000000001
internet with your mobile it's useless

7113.18 --> 7118.360000000001
nobody needs 5g nobody

7126.24 --> 7133.86
and for anything text-based anyway you

7130.0 --> 7136.77
don't need you don't even need 3G

7133.86 --> 7141.3099999999995
awesome you don't even need 40 I mean

7136.77 --> 7145.51
3ds video streaming yeah that that cost

7141.31 --> 7149.110000000001
some bandwidth that's true and 40 is

7145.51 --> 7152.26
just Lenny people are using 40 right now

7149.11 --> 7154.36
and it's plenty fluid it's not the

7152.26 --> 7156.16
fluidity of the things that are the

7154.36 --> 7158.41
problem sometimes connection you realize

7156.16 --> 7160.57
it's back it's not the fluidity that's

7158.41 --> 7162.97
the problem it's usually the interfaces

7160.57 --> 7164.98
and just the mismatching of the

7162.97 --> 7166.09
communication platforms and all that

7164.98 --> 7171.009999999999
that's the problem

7166.09 --> 7172.93
there is no problem with with delay with

7171.01 --> 7177.43
information bandwidth there is no

7172.93 --> 7185.92
problem it's great it's fine nobody

7177.43 --> 7188.17
needs 5g nobody ok so I'm with that I'm
