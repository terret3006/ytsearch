weather today

122.799 --> 126.84

124.56 --> 128.479
kind of summer

126.84 --> 131.92000000000002
summery

128.479 --> 131.92000000000002
it is nice but

132.239 --> 137.92000000000002
yeah this used to be very blue sky in

135.36 --> 137.92000000000002
the morning

138.16 --> 143.76
but uh yeah there were a lot of chem

141.76 --> 145.67999999999998
trails and they were definitely chem

143.76 --> 149.599
trails

145.68 --> 149.59900000000002
and now it's kind of hazy up there

150.48 --> 153.67999999999998
but yeah despite that there's not really

152.319 --> 157.51899999999998
a lot of wind

153.68 --> 160.239
and the sun is still pretty bright

157.519 --> 160.239
through all that

162.4 --> 169.48000000000002
so yeah still a beautiful day

165.04 --> 169.48
not as blue as it could be but

173.12 --> 177.92000000000002
hello pj c net first in chat good to see

176.08 --> 181.28
you

177.92 --> 181.28
dry essentially okay

182.879 --> 188.72
oh supposed to be raining according to

185.2 --> 188.72
the forecast in england

192.72 --> 195.76
well it could still happen

196.239 --> 199.68
maybe there's just a cloud that's kind

198.08 --> 201.92000000000002
of like

199.68 --> 204.87900000000002
hanging a bit lower and it might just

201.92 --> 207.2
move over you never know

204.879 --> 208.959
by the way let me check the weather here

207.2 --> 213.159
because i think

208.959 --> 213.159
we're seeing something like that

215.04 --> 220.159
it's 24 degrees celsius by the way here

217.84 --> 222.799
that's

220.159 --> 222.79899999999998
quite a lot

223.68 --> 229.12
right

225.04 --> 229.12
okay over here there's no forecast for

229.36 --> 232.72000000000003
rain

230.319 --> 235.11999999999998
but it does say that like

232.72 --> 237.439
sunday and after that it's gone it will

235.12 --> 237.439
rain

238.0 --> 241.84
but still be pretty warm

247.84 --> 251.12
hello jeff gassett

249.68 --> 255.84
amanda young

251.12 --> 255.84
tarat 306 good to see you

280.56 --> 284.56
a neal degrasse tyson lies good to see

282.72 --> 286.96000000000004
you too

284.56 --> 289.44
right so

286.96 --> 293.479
today i'm going to make a lot of effort

289.44 --> 293.479
to just take it easy

297.44 --> 302.71999999999997
another call with my healer before the

299.36 --> 307.199
show because i just got so

302.72 --> 307.199
well let's just say over excited angry

307.68 --> 313.52
yesterday

308.84 --> 315.11999999999995
was pretty yeah it was overall good day

313.52 --> 317.35999999999996
vladimir's debate was pretty good as

315.12 --> 317.36
well

320.0 --> 325.28
info wars

322.4 --> 328.32
now that was a story roll out about

325.28 --> 332.0
chemtrails in spain

328.32 --> 335.12
where they were admittedly throwing like

332.0 --> 338.8
some sort of pesticides in the air

335.12 --> 342.4
it's just a horrible

338.8 --> 342.40000000000003
yeah i think that got to me a bit

345.039 --> 350.59999999999997
avoiding jubilee stuff

347.6 --> 350.6
okay

358.639 --> 362.8
right yes preacher scene i heard

360.56 --> 364.96
something like that from adam meekin

362.8 --> 367.52000000000004
that there's like a bank holiday thing

364.96 --> 369.19899999999996
and

367.52 --> 371.44
in england

369.199 --> 373.6
right

371.44 --> 375.68
okay why are you

373.6 --> 377.91900000000004
avoiding it

375.68 --> 377.919
like

378.479 --> 385.199
i mean

380.8 --> 385.199
what what does the media even do with it

388.319 --> 392.56
i don't know i haven't even i don't

389.919 --> 397.96
check the tv normally and i i really

392.56 --> 397.96
never do so i don't know

420.84 --> 425.039
yeah

422.639 --> 425.039
also

426.0 --> 429.36
yeah finish watching

431.039 --> 436.56
season four part one

434.16 --> 438.319
of stranger things

436.56 --> 439.28000000000003
and that was kind of

438.319 --> 441.12
yeah

439.28 --> 442.79999999999995
there was definitely going to have to be

441.12 --> 445.52
a second part to it all because they

442.8 --> 448.639
basically build up to like

445.52 --> 448.639
peak potential but

448.84 --> 455.84
no no actual rollout so

452.4 --> 458.0
according to it

455.84 --> 460.63899999999995
first of july is going to be the second

458.0 --> 462.08
part so yeah

460.639 --> 465.08
so far it hasn't really been

462.08 --> 465.08
disappointing

465.36 --> 469.36
it's it's been pretty decent

471.919 --> 476.56
and like in a way even

474.319 --> 479.12
the way they kind of like put soviet

476.56 --> 482.24
russia in the picture

479.12 --> 486.0
is even kind of

482.24 --> 486.0
honest in a way i thought

487.84 --> 491.11999999999995
right

488.96 --> 493.68
like when they first introduced the

491.12 --> 496.0
russians being part of it

493.68 --> 498.0
part of the story in the seas in the was

496.0 --> 501.039
the second season or something it's the

498.0 --> 501.039
third not sure

501.36 --> 505.44
you kind of had to feel like oh dear

503.599 --> 507.039
they're gonna blame russia again for

505.44 --> 509.52
everything right

507.039 --> 511.52
well it doesn't seem like they're act

509.52 --> 514.399
they're really doing that they're trying

511.52 --> 518.56
to like really

514.399 --> 518.56
make it about like soviet russia

518.839 --> 522.32
and yeah

524.08 --> 529.12
like nothing about those parts really

526.72 --> 531.519
made me think like like this is just

529.12 --> 532.48
slandering and evil

531.519 --> 534.9590000000001
really

532.48 --> 537.2
it was pretty decently envisioned i

534.959 --> 537.1999999999999
thought

538.48 --> 542.32
like even the russian characters in

540.48 --> 543.9200000000001
there were yeah

542.32 --> 546.8000000000001
like

543.92 --> 548.8
they were not just stupid villain

546.8 --> 551.279
figures they really had kind of

548.8 --> 552.88
character i don't know it was

551.279 --> 555.2
it was okay i thought

552.88 --> 557.68
i don't know i'm of course not a russian

555.2 --> 558.88
cultural expert

557.68 --> 560.959
but

558.88 --> 562.88
i at least got the feeling that they

560.959 --> 564.959
they didn't just

562.88 --> 566.8
like politically let themselves go on

564.959 --> 568.2399999999999
that or anything

566.8 --> 570.4799999999999
whatever

568.24 --> 570.48
yeah

572.48 --> 576.72
you don't like supporting netflix yeah i

574.72 --> 580.5600000000001
don't like supporting netflix either

576.72 --> 580.5600000000001
they have garbage a lot of it

584.72 --> 588.48
but yeah i'm effectively not paying them

587.6 --> 590.16
anything

588.48 --> 592.8000000000001
i'm riding on somebody else's

590.16 --> 592.8
prescription

594.17 --> 597.26
[Music]

599.12 --> 604.12
with their permission

601.12 --> 604.12
uh

613.3 --> 618.5999999999999
[Music]

615.04 --> 618.5999999999999
right so that

620.37 --> 623.529
[Music]

624.24 --> 628.0
yeah

625.76 --> 630.079
i was kind of like looking around in my

628.0 --> 632.72
videos that some of the videos that i've

630.079 --> 634.8
downloaded over the years

632.72 --> 636.88
like that i didn't just recognize as

634.8 --> 638.4799999999999
like oh this is a hollywood movie or

636.88 --> 641.04
something because i've also just

638.48 --> 643.519
downloaded videos that i come across

641.04 --> 645.12
man i got some videos in there that are

643.519 --> 647.839
like

645.12 --> 647.839
scary

650.079 --> 657.3599999999999
but not as in oh fair porno but just as

653.6 --> 660.64
in like holy [ __ ] that is so esoteric

657.36 --> 664.72
and like urgent it's

660.64 --> 664.72
it's music video i found there

665.76 --> 670.16
i do remember having heard that

668.32 --> 672.0790000000001
and then kind of like turning it off

670.16 --> 674.88
because it's like

672.079 --> 678.079
it's so upfront

674.88 --> 678.079
this almost burns

684.079 --> 689.8389999999999
i don't know if that video is still out

685.76 --> 689.8389999999999
there but i downloaded it

691.04 --> 696.24
let's see what it's called maybe it's

693.519 --> 696.24
still out there

700.72 --> 705.76
oh yeah elon musk and the unseen zones

708.959 --> 713.04
let's see if i can find a download date

714.079 --> 722.4799999999999
oh november 1st 2017.

718.399 --> 722.48
yeah that's from a while ago oh

724.639 --> 727.92
it's a good chance that video is no

726.399 --> 731.12
longer out there

727.92 --> 734.7199999999999
or at least not with the original

731.12 --> 734.72
place that i downloaded it from

735.6 --> 740.36
hey slow mo moonbuggy good to see you

745.76 --> 749.639
hello psychics traveler

763.36 --> 769.04
i'll try to watch it straight look jeff

766.48 --> 770.0790000000001
you don't have to watch it

769.04 --> 773.76
alright

770.079 --> 775.92
it's not like it's blueberry or anything

773.76 --> 779.519
i mean blueberry i think that people

775.92 --> 779.519
should really watch that

779.839 --> 785.2790000000001
like at least once

782.639 --> 787.6
and for me also i just want to test like

785.279 --> 788.72
i want to test them and their spirit

787.6 --> 791.12
what they

788.72 --> 793.6
how they respond to it

791.12 --> 796.9590000000001
right i think it'll do some good i mean

793.6 --> 800.0
even my healer agreed to that

796.959 --> 802.6389999999999
and he's like standardized

800.0 --> 805.04
yeah usually very opposed to anything

802.639 --> 807.6800000000001
that basically suggests

805.04 --> 809.519
taking drugs

807.68 --> 812.3199999999999
would be good for any reason well the

809.519 --> 814.88
movie really doesn't do that

812.32 --> 817.279
it's not focusing on that

814.88 --> 817.279
at all

817.36 --> 820.399
right it's not even telling you what it

818.959 --> 822.2199999999999
is it's

820.399 --> 824.079
yeah it's different

822.22 --> 824.88
[Music]

824.079 --> 826.88
uh

824.88 --> 830.32
but yeah stranger things yeah if you're

826.88 --> 833.04
like into the 80s a lot because it is

830.32 --> 836.1600000000001
really like a nostalgia series about the

833.04 --> 838.639
80s it is really that

836.16 --> 840.56
and they do a remarkably good job i have

838.639 --> 843.36
to say

840.56 --> 846.8
i really think they do

843.36 --> 848.32
nostalgic yeah yeah a lot music

846.8 --> 849.279
situations

848.32 --> 852.1600000000001
like

849.279 --> 853.76
toys and

852.16 --> 855.04
like

853.76 --> 859.279
it likes

855.04 --> 863.279
events that happen and like the whole

859.279 --> 864.399
cold war situation is also going on and

863.279 --> 866.88
yeah

864.399 --> 868.639
that's really what it's it's very much a

866.88 --> 870.24
nostalgia

868.639 --> 871.12
series

870.24 --> 873.6800000000001
right

871.12 --> 876.16
and they also in that sense kind of like

873.68 --> 879.68
extra try to play on your heartstrings

876.16 --> 881.279
which can be a bit annoying at times

879.68 --> 884.0
right

881.279 --> 888.079
but

884.0 --> 890.72
still i think it's it's decent enough

888.079 --> 892.959
in ways and in other ways it is like

890.72 --> 895.0400000000001
kind of misguided but i guess that's an

892.959 --> 899.199
80s thing or something

895.04 --> 901.5999999999999
it it does really feel like 80s

899.199 --> 903.519
but yeah i thought overall it is an

901.6 --> 905.44
interesting serie also i like it

903.519 --> 908.0
personally because of their dungeons and

905.44 --> 909.519
dragons references in there

908.0 --> 911.76
and like

909.519 --> 914.079
they do actually understand dungeons and

911.76 --> 918.3199999999999
dragons although their all of their lore

914.079 --> 920.56
is all kind of 2.0 which would that time

918.32 --> 922.72
frame it was then that's

920.56 --> 925.8389999999999
2.0 time

922.72 --> 927.6800000000001
right one and two

925.839 --> 930.5600000000001
like the books these kids even play from

927.68 --> 930.56
is 2.0

932.24 --> 935.6800000000001
and so i like that about it

936.64 --> 943.199
[Music]

938.0 --> 944.959
and yeah well mk ultra stuff is in there

943.199 --> 947.12
it is kind of the main

944.959 --> 951.2399999999999
thing

947.12 --> 951.24
main character arc

956.48 --> 960.72
so it is definitely interesting

961.199 --> 965.7589999999999
and i think overall it is pretty well

963.199 --> 965.7589999999999
crafted

967.36 --> 970.16
although yeah

971.44 --> 975.839
i don't know

973.12 --> 978.0
it is kind of creepy spooky it is like

975.839 --> 980.639
really about the shadow realm they call

978.0 --> 982.32
it the upside down it's the shadow realm

980.639 --> 984.32
that's just what that's literally what

982.32 --> 986.399
that is in dnd

984.32 --> 988.48
like i can literally look up the page

986.399 --> 991.199
for you and like everything that's in

988.48 --> 993.279
there literally happens

991.199 --> 994.7199999999999
in the upside down so it is just a

993.279 --> 997.8389999999999
shadow room i don't even know why they

994.72 --> 999.44
don't just call it the shadow realm

997.839 --> 1002.639
on the other hand

999.44 --> 1006.8800000000001
they're like naming it as they go

1002.639 --> 1006.88
and being kind of punny about it too so

1008.079 --> 1012.8
it's just their thing but yeah

1013.69 --> 1016.9190000000001
[Music]

1023.759 --> 1027.6
it's a wonder they haven't twisted how

1025.76 --> 1029.679
they portrayed the 1980s to fit their

1027.6 --> 1031.36
agenda their push yes

1029.679 --> 1035.679
well that's what i was afraid of that

1031.36 --> 1037.28
they would were gonna do that fully

1035.679 --> 1039.439
but

1037.28 --> 1042.799
they really showed like a picture

1039.439 --> 1044.72
overall like these are forces that

1042.799 --> 1046.16
everybody dealing with it really is in

1044.72 --> 1048.799
over their head

1046.16 --> 1048.799
and they're like

1050.16 --> 1054.16
like kind of neutral about that so i

1052.64 --> 1056.0800000000002
thought like oh

1054.16 --> 1058.0800000000002
oh somebody in russian is going to be

1056.08 --> 1061.84
the ultimate bad guy or something but

1058.08 --> 1061.84
that just doesn't seem to be the case

1063.039 --> 1069.12
which is a great relief

1066.72 --> 1071.1200000000001
so yeah whatever whoever has been

1069.12 --> 1073.039
writing the stories

1071.12 --> 1076.0
the script and i don't know if they like

1073.039 --> 1077.84
pre-read it wrote it like even before

1076.0 --> 1080.48
they started making the series or if

1077.84 --> 1082.1599999999999
they actually write it part by part as

1080.48 --> 1084.4
they go i'm not sure

1082.16 --> 1086.88
but whoever is in charge is really

1084.4 --> 1089.6000000000001
making sure that it is about nostalgia

1086.88 --> 1091.919
and not about

1089.6 --> 1093.039
like current political events in some

1091.919 --> 1094.96
way

1093.039 --> 1098.08
they're really making sure of that and

1094.96 --> 1099.8400000000001
that's sensible because if they wouldn't

1098.08 --> 1103.84
the entire thing would completely

1099.84 --> 1103.84
disintegrate and everybody would hate it

1107.44 --> 1112.4
i was like kind of nervous after the

1109.679 --> 1114.88
third season like oh the fourth season i

1112.4 --> 1118.96
hope they're not gonna ruin it

1114.88 --> 1120.16
i thought that they might and yeah no

1118.96 --> 1123.039
seems

1120.16 --> 1125.6000000000001
seems like it's pretty good

1123.039 --> 1128.0
and they're making it in a way that

1125.6 --> 1131.28
definitely promises that there could be

1128.0 --> 1133.76
even more follow-up seasons

1131.28 --> 1134.8799999999999
so that they are figuring out a formula

1133.76 --> 1137.61
that is

1134.88 --> 1140.7600000000002
continuating

you

1280.0 --> 1287.2
some time ago

1282.48 --> 1292.799

1443.6 --> 1448.7199999999998
sound right it's so it's it's blatant

1446.48 --> 1451.84
mandela effect

1448.72 --> 1454.72
it's really funny because

1451.84 --> 1457.039
i know the name

1454.72 --> 1460.08
and i remember that everybody does

1457.039 --> 1461.12
pronounce it olstein

1460.08 --> 1462.799
but

1461.12 --> 1465.12
i'm not surprised that you don't

1462.799 --> 1468.9189999999999
actually write it like that

1465.12 --> 1468.9189999999999
very very mandela

1473.919 --> 1477.8400000000001
right a lot of the sometimes

1476.24 --> 1480.32
pronunciations

1477.84 --> 1482.48
and the way it's written is just not the

1480.32 --> 1484.96
same

1482.48 --> 1486.96
it's like oh somebody's it's like this

1484.96 --> 1488.4
but this is how you pronounce it and

1486.96 --> 1490.0
then everybody just learns how you

1488.4 --> 1492.0800000000002
pronounce it

1490.0 --> 1493.039
even though it it kind of doesn't really

1492.08 --> 1494.48
match

1493.039 --> 1496.559
how it's written

1494.48 --> 1501.24
how you would normally phonetically

1496.559 --> 1501.24
interpret that right that just happens

1508.559 --> 1513.76
right and if somebody just calls him

1510.64 --> 1518.919
olstein in a video or whatever that's

1513.76 --> 1518.919

1630.159 --> 1634.3200000000002

1632.0 --> 1636.64
it's probably involved with music or or

1634.32 --> 1639.12
not no

1636.64 --> 1642.88
old scene

1639.12 --> 1645.9189999999999

i'm not sure about the manila effect

1654.32 --> 1658.559

1656.559 --> 1659.98
psychological

that's what's real about it

1661.279 --> 1667.279

and everybody does it in the same

1667.279 --> 1673.2
way

1669.12 --> 1676.1589999999999
because the mind corrects things

1673.2 --> 1677.279
if something doesn't sound right for a

1676.159 --> 1679.8400000000001
very

1677.279 --> 1682.88
mystic reasons usually spiritual that

1679.84 --> 1685.1999999999998
doesn't really even reach your cognition

1682.88 --> 1688.24
you don't become conscious

1685.2 --> 1691.2
why you don't like it you just don't

1688.24 --> 1694.0
like it and you will want to correct it

1691.2 --> 1698.0
in your mind slightly

1694.0 --> 1701.039
and everybody does it the same way and

1698.0 --> 1704.64
that's the mandela effect purely

1701.039 --> 1707.76

1704.64 --> 1707.76

welcome to the real world

what should freak you out the most is

1772.399 --> 1777.36
how

1774.72 --> 1779.919
many things your mind actually deludes

1777.36 --> 1781.9189999999999
you about without you even realizing it

1779.919 --> 1784.48
and that's what mandela

1781.919 --> 1784.48
reveals

1784.799 --> 1789.6
that we don't know

1786.799 --> 1792.08
about how our mind fools us

1789.6 --> 1794.32
most of the time people just

1792.08 --> 1798.559
want get a grasp it's not even that they

1794.32 --> 1798.559
can't they won't get a grasp

1799.2 --> 1802.88
they insist

1800.799 --> 1805.52
that the way their mind has changed

1802.88 --> 1807.7600000000002
things is reality and that's the real

1805.52 --> 1809.84
mandela people that are just like no i

1807.76 --> 1812.24
remember it correctly everything has

1809.84 --> 1812.24
changed

1818.24 --> 1823.84

it's funny

it's not how you spell it

your mind

1848.799 --> 1854.08
it's not how you spell it i think i even

1851.039 --> 1857.12
remember my mother like telling me

1854.08 --> 1861.12
like yes it's osteen but you pronounce

1857.12 --> 1863.5189999999998
it olsteen like i have memories of that

that are

still

1864.799 --> 1868.399
loosely within my grasp

1872.88 --> 1878.3990000000001

2248.24 --> 2255.359
i explained it like

2251.359 --> 2257.5989999999997

2255.359 --> 2260.56
guys

2257.599 --> 2261.92
i even mentioned this one with full

2260.56 --> 2265.2
example

2261.92 --> 2265.2000000000003
at some point i think

2268.24 --> 2271.4399999999996
like

2269.359 --> 2273.04
guys if somebody is not gonna get it

2271.44 --> 2275.92
right in my chat

2273.04 --> 2278.8

2275.92 --> 2282.88
you okay i'm gonna stop giving you the

2278.8 --> 2286.8390000000004
answers because you can't even attain it

2282.88 --> 2286.839
without me apparently

2297.94 --> 2301.15
[Music]

2304.64 --> 2310.72
narrator no

2306.64 --> 2310.72
no tobinoy that's not even funny

2311.04 --> 2313.839

2326.56 --> 2331.839
yeah see it's like you have you guys all

2329.68 --> 2334.3999999999996
been lobotomized

2331.839 --> 2337.119
don't you have that part of your brain

2334.4 --> 2337.119
anymore

2338.4 --> 2346.079
where you can literally

2340.72 --> 2347.2
hear me urgently inquire a very specific

2346.079 --> 2349.2000000000003
one

2347.2 --> 2352.2
not what

2349.2 --> 2352.2

2375.42 --> 2378.699
[Music]

2399.119 --> 2403.52
in the movie

2402.48 --> 2408.319
why

2403.52 --> 2408.319
would she have bracers

2408.48 --> 2411.04
hello

2409.599 --> 2412.6400000000003
hello

2411.04 --> 2416.16

like 10 minutes later

2416.72 --> 2422.64
i mean i get the feeling you guys really

2419.44 --> 2425.599
think that i'm just a joke here

2422.64 --> 2427.92
and even the trolls are piping up

2425.599 --> 2430.56
because all the wrenches are not

2427.92 --> 2432.8
answering

2430.56 --> 2436.0789999999997
even though i'm asking you a direct

2432.8 --> 2439.079
question that i demand an answer with

2436.079 --> 2439.079
okay

2453.04 --> 2457.68
cause jaws did

2455.44 --> 2457.68
it's

2460.56 --> 2465.16

right thank you tony whitcomb getting

2484.8 --> 2490.8
closer it's not fully there but at least

2487.119 --> 2492.6400000000003
you actually contextually try to answer

2490.8 --> 2496.1600000000003
it thank you

2492.64 --> 2499.359
thank you somebody actually trying to

2496.16 --> 2502.0789999999997
answer the urgent question directly

2499.359 --> 2504.24
asked towards the people in chat

2502.079 --> 2509.5600000000004
thank you

2504.24 --> 2509.56
jesus christ you guys are slow

2515.44 --> 2521.2400000000002
not

2516.56 --> 2521.24
shut the [ __ ] up dude [ __ ] off

2522.24 --> 2525.2799999999997
why

2523.76 --> 2527.2000000000003
yeah

2525.28 --> 2529.5600000000004
getting closer tony

2527.2 --> 2531.5989999999997
you've at least you tried

2529.56 --> 2533.119
dissatisfactory enough for me to just

2531.599 --> 2535.119
say it because i don't want to wait

2533.119 --> 2537.92
another 10 minutes for everybody to

2535.119 --> 2541.119
stumble and blunder around like a bunch

2537.92 --> 2541.119
of headless chickens

2542.079 --> 2546.319
yeah you only came in two minutes ago

2544.319 --> 2548.079
yeah

2546.319 --> 2551.839
that's right

2548.079 --> 2551.8390000000004
and you did it right immediately

2554.24 --> 2559.5989999999997
can you imagine tony like everybody else

2556.88 --> 2563.6400000000003
in the chat here has been around

2559.599 --> 2563.6400000000003
and nobody's answering

2569.68 --> 2575.52
dude [ __ ] you [ __ ]

2574.24 --> 2577.359
[ __ ] you

2575.52 --> 2578.64
you [ __ ]

2577.359 --> 2581.2
half-wit

2578.64 --> 2581.2
[ __ ]

2581.28 --> 2588.079
you can't answer the question

2583.76 --> 2588.079
and get the [ __ ] out of my check

2591.44 --> 2594.16
yeah this is not

2593.2 --> 2596.56
your

2594.16 --> 2599.44
place to hang around because you're

2596.56 --> 2603.04
bored okay

2599.44 --> 2605.76
you understand this is a workshop

2603.04 --> 2609.839
you don't get to hang around and be

2605.76 --> 2609.8390000000004
[ __ ] in my chat okay

2614.4 --> 2620.2400000000002
yeah so let me continue

2617.44 --> 2622.88
tony whitcomb actually starting to

2620.24 --> 2624.0
actually answer the question yeah like

2622.88 --> 2629.04
why

2624.0 --> 2629.04
would you remember her having razors

2629.359 --> 2633.359
because

2631.92 --> 2635.76
it was

2633.359 --> 2638.7999999999997
like a karmic thing

2635.76 --> 2640.96
it was essential for the spiritual

2638.8 --> 2643.2000000000003
development

2640.96 --> 2644.319
sympathy

2643.2 --> 2647.2799999999997
right

2644.319 --> 2651.04
the jaws guy with the metal teeth

2647.28 --> 2652.88
kind of creepy kind of tragic

2651.04 --> 2653.7599999999998
we wanted

2652.88 --> 2656.8
him

2653.76 --> 2658.079
to kind of snap out of it

2656.8 --> 2660.7200000000003
and the girl

2658.079 --> 2662.96
seemed to be the figure so if she would

2660.72 --> 2664.3999999999996
have had braces it would have been the

2662.96 --> 2666.96
ultimate

2664.4 --> 2668.64
resonance moment it would have been

2666.96 --> 2670.96
perfect

2668.64 --> 2672.8799999999997
you understand

2670.96 --> 2676.0
perfect like

2672.88 --> 2676.8
the rosetta stone on the entire story

2676.0 --> 2678.4
arc

2676.8 --> 2679.8390000000004
that's

2678.4 --> 2683.839
why

2679.839 --> 2687.2799999999997
you remember that because you want it it

2683.839 --> 2689.44
would have been perfect and they didn't

2687.28 --> 2693.599
do it

2689.44 --> 2695.2000000000003
they left the capstone off the pyramid

2693.599 --> 2697.119
and you

2695.2 --> 2698.96
filled it

2697.119 --> 2700.6400000000003
in

2698.96 --> 2705.079
that's why

2700.64 --> 2705.0789999999997
do you understand now

2710.0 --> 2717.24
yes tony whitcomb you get it thank god

2712.88 --> 2717.2400000000002
somebody actually gets it

2718.4 --> 2723.28
god some of you guys are slow it is

2723.599 --> 2726.4
remarkable

2727.359 --> 2732.7999999999997
right it is the mandela effect

2729.92 --> 2735.839
that's why you remember it like that

2732.8 --> 2740.0
because it would have to be they

2735.839 --> 2744.0
it was an atrocity that they didn't do

2740.0 --> 2748.0
it so you remember it the way

2744.0 --> 2752.0
you think it should have happened

2748.0 --> 2755.44
that's what the mandela effect is

2752.0 --> 2757.04
and i'm absolutely a hundred percent

2755.44 --> 2761.44
certain of this

2757.04 --> 2763.68
every single example can be traced to

2761.44 --> 2766.56
exactly this

2763.68 --> 2770.319
because you never complain about

2766.56 --> 2771.839
something like wait that's not right

2770.319 --> 2773.44
the name

2771.839 --> 2776.64
or the scene

2773.44 --> 2779.92
should be off

2776.64 --> 2781.92
but it isn't it's all smoothened out

2779.92 --> 2784.56
that makes no sense

2781.92 --> 2786.64
you never remember something for being

2784.56 --> 2789.68
too perfect you always remember

2786.64 --> 2792.0789999999997
something or something perfect having

2789.68 --> 2793.2
been left out

2792.079 --> 2794.0
that's

2793.2 --> 2797.4399999999996
why

2794.0 --> 2799.2
you mandela affected in your mind

2797.44 --> 2800.56
because something

2799.2 --> 2803.4399999999996
wasn't

2800.56 --> 2806.4
as it should have been

2803.44 --> 2809.52
karmically story building wise

2806.4 --> 2811.44
spiritually in the experience they took

2809.52 --> 2812.64
something out that should have been

2811.44 --> 2815.52
there

2812.64 --> 2818.0789999999997
you can't deal with that

2815.52 --> 2821.68
it's an attack on the dream and the

2818.079 --> 2827.3590000000004
memory of the story so you

2821.68 --> 2830.7999999999997
fix it in your mind and put the capstone

2827.359 --> 2834.319
where there is none in your mind

2830.8 --> 2836.7200000000003
that's the mandela effect they leave

2834.319 --> 2838.48
something out that should not have been

2836.72 --> 2841.4399999999996
left out right

2838.48 --> 2843.92
nobody wants to see a pyramid without

2841.44 --> 2846.4
the point on top a pyramid that's a

2843.92 --> 2847.359
stump top it's

2846.4 --> 2850.96
wrong

2847.359 --> 2852.0
you need to have that completed in your

2850.96 --> 2853.52
mind

2852.0 --> 2854.4
so your mind

2853.52 --> 2855.68
will

2854.4 --> 2857.52
complete it

2855.68 --> 2861.52
that's the

2857.52 --> 2861.52
mandela effect

2864.93 --> 2870.5589999999997
[Music]

2868.0 --> 2872.079
and the more you get invested

2870.559 --> 2873.92
emotionally

2872.079 --> 2876.48
in a movie

2873.92 --> 2879.28
in something the deeper your heart is

2876.48 --> 2881.359
pulled in the stronger the mandela

2879.28 --> 2885.119
effect will correct

2881.359 --> 2887.2799999999997
the blatant atrocities the errors

2885.119 --> 2889.52
that were in there that you cannot

2887.28 --> 2891.76
accept because it's close to your heart

2889.52 --> 2894.24
just like if you're

2891.76 --> 2897.8390000000004
super in love with somebody and they

2894.24 --> 2900.24
have like a weird trait

2897.839 --> 2904.72
that is like kind of repulsive you

2900.24 --> 2909.04
literally blank it out of your mind

2904.72 --> 2912.16
because you can't have that existing

2909.04 --> 2914.5589999999997
right until it becomes too much

2912.16 --> 2916.48
until it like yeah until you can't block

2914.559 --> 2919.119
it out anymore but you do that

2916.48 --> 2922.2400000000002
it's an idealization of the mind because

2919.119 --> 2924.96
the heart is pulled close and this

2922.24 --> 2927.4399999999996
happens not just with people that we

2924.96 --> 2928.4
deal with or fall in love with it also

2927.44 --> 2929.76
happens

2928.4 --> 2934.559
with

2929.76 --> 2936.96
books we read with movies we watch

2934.559 --> 2941.3590000000004
it happens if we become emotionally

2936.96 --> 2945.2
invested our minds will start to correct

2941.359 --> 2948.16
incompletions and errors in the story

2945.2 --> 2950.5589999999997
and the spirit mechanics of it your mind

2948.16 --> 2953.359
will fill it in and you will remember

2950.559 --> 2955.8390000000004
the cor the mind corrected version

2953.359 --> 2956.88
that's the mandela effect it is what it

2955.839 --> 2959.2799999999997
is

2956.88 --> 2962.1600000000003
and i'm absolutely hundred percent

2959.28 --> 2962.1600000000003
certain about this

2965.45 --> 2968.58
[Music]

2968.96 --> 2973.92
yeah godzilla a line in the lamp that's

2971.28 --> 2976.0
actually from songs that were made it's

2973.92 --> 2978.16
not in the bible

2976.0 --> 2981.119
there were songs made

2978.16 --> 2981.1189999999997
lying in the lamp

2982.16 --> 2987.2799999999997
that's what you remember because you're

2984.559 --> 2990.079
you've been hearing that

2987.28 --> 2992.079
like on radio and tv and other people

2990.079 --> 2995.079
hear that and then that's what they

2992.079 --> 2995.079
remember

3002.319 --> 3007.2
you hear the better version your mind

3004.48 --> 3008.8
makes up which one is better and that's

3007.2 --> 3010.48
what you remember and then you project

3008.8 --> 3013.92
that onto

3010.48 --> 3016.4
the regions where it isn't corrected

3013.92 --> 3018.319
and then you think hey it's wrong it

3016.4 --> 3020.2400000000002
should be this no

3018.319 --> 3022.4
it was always that

3020.24 --> 3024.72
something else was around

3022.4 --> 3027.44
or you already automatically corrected

3024.72 --> 3030.16
it in your mind and then you projected

3027.44 --> 3032.4
that onto well what you thought was

3030.16 --> 3033.68
incomplete

3032.4 --> 3037.319
on like a

3033.68 --> 3037.319
aesthetic level

3056.079 --> 3059.119
a double fake

3060.559 --> 3065.44
well that domino i don't even know where

3062.96 --> 3065.44
to start

3065.68 --> 3071.2
that would be really weird but how like

3068.96 --> 3074.079
i mean

3071.2 --> 3076.48
it would make sense if if if

3074.079 --> 3078.8
people actually did find back like

3076.48 --> 3081.2
videotapes and whatever where she did

3078.8 --> 3082.8
have the races

3081.2 --> 3084.8799999999997
then there is

3082.8 --> 3087.2000000000003
like trickery go and then somebody's

3084.88 --> 3088.0
actually creating a fake mandela effect

3087.2 --> 3090.48
through

3088.0 --> 3093.04
some kind of a deep fake thing

3090.48 --> 3095.92
but i don't think that's the case

3093.04 --> 3098.24
i think that it was just really

3095.92 --> 3100.0
necessary for everybody that she had

3098.24 --> 3101.4399999999996
bracers because then it would have been

3100.0 --> 3103.68
a perfect match

3101.44 --> 3106.7200000000003
and it wasn't and was a major

3103.68 --> 3107.44
disappointment and people just remember

3106.72 --> 3110.9199999999996
it

3107.44 --> 3110.92
like it was

3112.0 --> 3116.96
like how it should have been

3114.079 --> 3116.96
that's what i think

3121.839 --> 3127.92
no i'm not gonna have a stream with

3124.079 --> 3127.92
stavely absolutely not

3132.72 --> 3139.72
she did have races though oh well where

3136.24 --> 3139.72
in what scenes

3144.72 --> 3151.359
maybe she did maybe they took it out

3148.559 --> 3154.6400000000003
like maybe literally

3151.359 --> 3156.72
they just thought that not having braces

3154.64 --> 3159.04
would have made it better

3156.72 --> 3161.9199999999996
but it was like sorely wrong because

3159.04 --> 3164.4
everybody expected that

3161.92 --> 3167.44
whatever it is if it's if there's no

3164.4 --> 3170.559
traces of this then it just wasn't there

3167.44 --> 3172.96
is no physical reality alteration

3170.559 --> 3172.96
happening

3173.119 --> 3177.48
only mind alteration

3184.559 --> 3189.119
besides even the suggestion oh no the

3187.04 --> 3191.68
physical reality although you can't

3189.119 --> 3194.1600000000003
prove you literally can't prove that

3191.68 --> 3195.52
like that's physically improvable it's

3194.16 --> 3197.7599999999998
ridiculous

3195.52 --> 3201.599
why would you think such a thing

3197.76 --> 3201.599
when you could never prove it

3201.68 --> 3204.0
ever

3206.839 --> 3213.359
it's way more logical to approach it

3210.559 --> 3217.52
psychologically because the mind does do

3213.359 --> 3220.4
that sort of thing it really does

3217.52 --> 3222.16
provably it's registered within

3220.4 --> 3226.559
psychology

3222.16 --> 3226.5589999999997
especially in like relationships is that

3226.72 --> 3232.319
it's like lovers they just think each

3229.76 --> 3233.76
other amazing and then after they kind

3232.319 --> 3236.079
of break up

3233.76 --> 3238.2400000000002
and like wait a while meet each other

3236.079 --> 3239.119
again they don't even recognize each

3238.24 --> 3241.04
other

3239.119 --> 3244.2400000000002
because they've projected so many

3241.04 --> 3249.079
alterations okay

3244.24 --> 3249.0789999999997
that's all real it's psychological

a more mainstream view friend mainstream

3275.44 --> 3279.839
dude i don't follow any view this is

3277.839 --> 3281.359
what i figured out about the mandela

3279.839 --> 3285.7599999999998
effect

3281.359 --> 3288.48
not even digging into things

only on occasion maybe hearing

3288.48 --> 3294.079
owen benjamin ramble on about it for a

3290.88 --> 3296.319
bit right that's like the most i can

3294.079 --> 3300.319
tolerate it because i can't stand this

3296.319 --> 3304.64
crap i can't stand the way mandela

3300.319 --> 3306.48
fans hype it up it's just [ __ ]

3304.64 --> 3308.64
it's like oh your entire reality is

3306.48 --> 3311.52
scattered oh it's so

3308.64 --> 3314.48
pointless ah

they're changing everything dudes get a

3337.359 --> 3341.5989999999997
when i do my

am i is it really too much to expect

3345.44 --> 3349.359
from people that have been like

3346.96 --> 3353.04
following me for a year is it too much

3349.359 --> 3353.04
to expect at this point to just

3354.559 --> 3358.4
have you answer my question in a very

3356.88 --> 3360.2400000000002
specific way

3358.4 --> 3362.4
i mean

3360.24 --> 3365.4399999999996
i am a teacher right

3362.4 --> 3369.359
i'm not just a clown

3365.44 --> 3371.52
doing technobabble so you can feel smart

3369.359 --> 3373.62
and maybe learn a few trixies i'm

actually trying to

[Music]

3376.0 --> 3380.88
provide skill

3378.24 --> 3383.2

3380.88 --> 3383.2000000000003
okay

3385.92 --> 3390.6800000000003
i don't know

3387.68 --> 3390.68
layla

3390.799 --> 3397.4
but there's calendars of that so

3393.28 --> 3397.4
you could just google it

3411.92 --> 3417.96
yeah gorgeous yeah i don't care i don't

3414.559 --> 3417.96
care bro

3418.96 --> 3423.04
i don't give a [ __ ]

3420.88 --> 3425.04
you're not going to tell me that i don't

3423.04 --> 3426.96
recognize my own mother

3425.04 --> 3430.24
all right godzilla

3426.96 --> 3433.76
i've never been like i can't imagine a

3430.24 --> 3435.04
grave or insult really i really can't

3433.76 --> 3435.92
still

3435.04 --> 3438.4
and

3435.92 --> 3439.76
your attitude that you have to actually

3438.4 --> 3441.92
say that

3439.76 --> 3443.6800000000003
that you have to say it again you have

3441.92 --> 3444.48
to mention it again

3443.68 --> 3446.64
so

3444.48 --> 3448.96
you're still insisting you're right

3446.64 --> 3450.64
aren't you gorzilla

3448.96 --> 3453.92
after all this

3450.64 --> 3455.04
you still insist that you were right

3453.92 --> 3457.92
don't you

3455.04 --> 3461.119
say it godzilla say say it

3457.92 --> 3462.48
you didn't let it go you still think you

3461.119 --> 3465.04
were right

3462.48 --> 3468.4
and that there is a chance

3465.04 --> 3470.799
that i didn't recognize my own freaking

3468.4 --> 3470.799
mother

3472.839 --> 3476.319
yeah

3474.4 --> 3478.2400000000002
by my own logic

3476.319 --> 3482.4
yeah but except

3478.24 --> 3483.7599999999998
this isn't a movie picture

3482.4 --> 3487.44
this is a

3483.76 --> 3490.559
once in a lifetime unique experience

3487.44 --> 3493.119
in moments of pretty heavy grief

3490.559 --> 3496.2400000000002
and i did pay a lot of attention because

3493.119 --> 3498.88
i was also a spiritual investigator and

3496.24 --> 3500.4799999999996
i was very interested in these sort of

3498.88 --> 3503.119
things

3500.48 --> 3504.48
right

3503.119 --> 3507.119
but

3504.48 --> 3510.079
the sensory input that i have is

3507.119 --> 3512.96
unmistakable

3510.079 --> 3516.6400000000003
there is nothing to correct there was no

3512.96 --> 3521.04
incorrection there was no thing wrong

3516.64 --> 3524.0789999999997
there was no weird aberrant impulse

3521.04 --> 3527.52
that made me have to correct it it

3524.079 --> 3529.8390000000004
doesn't apply it doesn't apply very

3527.52 --> 3533.92
specifically it doesn't

3529.839 --> 3537.2
because it was no imperfection about the

3533.92 --> 3539.599
experience there was no impurity there

3537.2 --> 3542.64
was no seduction there was no dark

3539.599 --> 3544.319
suggestion there wasn't even any

3542.64 --> 3548.16
suggestion

3544.319 --> 3548.16
it was just a hello

3553.28 --> 3558.4
yeah you didn't say but that is what

3555.44 --> 3558.4
that means though

3559.92 --> 3563.76
oh so

3561.44 --> 3565.839
you think that i wouldn't recognize

3563.76 --> 3568.2400000000002
something

3565.839 --> 3570.72
like a ghostly apparition

3568.24 --> 3573.1189999999997
with like the spirit of my mother

3570.72 --> 3575.5989999999997
you you don't think i would recognize

3573.119 --> 3577.6800000000003
the spirit of my own mother so you

3575.599 --> 3580.6400000000003
literally think i am spiritually

3577.68 --> 3583.5989999999997
[ __ ] and my sensories can be

3580.64 --> 3586.48
absolutely not trusted with anything

3583.599 --> 3589.28
because i can't even distinguish the

3586.48 --> 3593.92
essence of my own freaking mother on a

3589.28 --> 3593.92
visceral level according to you godzilla

3594.64 --> 3602.319
so you have absolutely no trust

3598.079 --> 3606.0
on any level about my sensories so i am

3602.319 --> 3608.48
basically a rambling madman to you

3606.0 --> 3611.44
that might accidentally be right at

3608.48 --> 3614.88
times because apparently i can even

3611.44 --> 3616.88
trust my own senses to recognize my own

3614.88 --> 3620.4
[ __ ] mother

3616.88 --> 3620.4
according to you godzilla

3620.48 --> 3625.04
it's never what you said yeah but it is

3622.72 --> 3627.359
it is and you're still holding on to i

3625.04 --> 3630.64
can't believe you're doing this i can't

3627.359 --> 3632.96
believe you're this [ __ ] thick

3630.64 --> 3635.52
gorzilla

3632.96 --> 3639.079
after all this time i can't believe

3635.52 --> 3639.079
you're this thick

3652.42 --> 3655.6800000000003
[Music]

3654.079 --> 3658.6800000000003
i can't believe it

3655.68 --> 3658.68
serious

3678.0 --> 3683.76
yeah so hey godzilla yeah yeah yeah it

3682.559 --> 3686.4
doesn't

3683.76 --> 3689.76
apply

3686.4 --> 3692.28
even mechanically it doesn't apply do

3689.76 --> 3695.6800000000003
you understand gorzilla you are

3692.28 --> 3695.6800000000003
fundamentally wrong

3697.52 --> 3702.48
it's exactly the inside out

3700.24 --> 3706.319
if there would have been any sign of

3702.48 --> 3707.599
imperfection of any kind

3706.319 --> 3710.0
then

3707.599 --> 3711.92
maybe the mandela affected

3710.0 --> 3716.24
effect would have applied because then

3711.92 --> 3719.119
i'd have something to correct in my mind

3716.24 --> 3722.0
which is what the mandela effect is

3719.119 --> 3725.52
right this could have potentially

3722.0 --> 3727.28
happened if i got really emotionally

3725.52 --> 3730.079
invested

3727.28 --> 3732.4
when i was with the medium

3730.079 --> 3734.4
that like i had this conversation with

3732.4 --> 3737.359
this alleged

3734.4 --> 3739.359
deity or whatever it was with right

3737.359 --> 3741.92
because that thing

3739.359 --> 3744.16
did get weird on me

3741.92 --> 3746.16
but i didn't i wasn't emotionally

3744.16 --> 3748.799
invested at that point

3746.16 --> 3750.16
so i recognize it and i remember it

3748.799 --> 3753.2
because

3750.16 --> 3755.839
i'm okay with it not turning out to be

3753.2 --> 3758.3999999999996
perfect as i wanted yeah

3755.839 --> 3761.0389999999998
i didn't need to mandela correctly

3758.4 --> 3764.1600000000003
because i wasn't emotionally invested

3761.039 --> 3767.599
like that yeah with my mother's ghost

3764.16 --> 3769.359
apparition experience there was

3767.599 --> 3770.1600000000003
no

3769.359 --> 3773.44
no

3770.16 --> 3777.2799999999997
bad influence no weirdness nothing there

3773.44 --> 3779.839
was no weird oddity side effect not even

3777.28 --> 3782.799
a little shock nothing

3779.839 --> 3785.839
it was a mystical moment

3782.799 --> 3786.96
there is no application of mandela

3785.839 --> 3788.72
effect

3786.96 --> 3791.68
there is none

3788.72 --> 3794.0
you don't seem to understand the mandela

3791.68 --> 3797.44

3794.0 --> 3798.72
you're just doubling down on being wrong

3797.44 --> 3800.319

after a week

3800.319 --> 3803.0389999999998
gorzilla

3808.079 --> 3813.52
yeah you did say that godzilla

3810.799 --> 3815.52
you said is exactly the same you

3813.52 --> 3818.079
literally are referring to the things

3815.52 --> 3820.64
that i am talking about

3818.079 --> 3824.1600000000003
right now with mandela effect saying it

3820.64 --> 3826.96
applied to my mother you said that you

3824.16 --> 3829.5989999999997
brought that up godzilla stop being a

3826.96 --> 3832.88
petty liar

3829.599 --> 3832.88
man the [ __ ] up

3834.0 --> 3837.4
you were wrong

he

3850.079 --> 3855.119
stopped being a little grambler weenie

3852.799 --> 3855.119

3855.44 --> 3860.16
man the [ __ ] up stop trying to worm

3858.4 --> 3863.6800000000003
yourself out of this

3860.16 --> 3865.52
you're wrong you dragged it in again

3863.68 --> 3867.9199999999996
you should know better

3865.52 --> 3870.0
and now you're getting hammered for it

3867.92 --> 3874.52
and if you don't [ __ ] repent i'm

3870.0 --> 3874.52
gonna ban you again you understand

3884.9 --> 3888.059
[Music]

3897.599 --> 3902.48
no one is right what the [ __ ] are you

3899.839 --> 3902.48
talking about

3905.039 --> 3908.0
if no one is right then nobody has a

3906.96 --> 3911.0
piece of the puzzle that's

3908.0 --> 3911.0
self-contradictory

3921.52 --> 3926.72
thank you pjcnet

3923.599 --> 3929.92
yeah apparently some people think

3926.72 --> 3932.5589999999997
that if it doesn't like come directly

3929.92 --> 3933.839
out of their bible physically or out of

3932.559 --> 3936.2400000000002
that one

3933.839 --> 3937.839
priest they trust that it's all the

3936.24 --> 3940.4799999999996
devil or something

3937.839 --> 3943.68
some people think that everything is the

3940.48 --> 3946.64
devil that literally

3943.68 --> 3949.68
like 99 percent of everything that you

3946.64 --> 3951.68
ever experience is just the devil

3949.68 --> 3955.0389999999998
some people really think that they've

3951.68 --> 3959.1189999999997
become completely paranoid completely

3955.039 --> 3962.2400000000002
spiritually paranoid by priests

3959.119 --> 3964.7200000000003
by priestly indoctrination

3962.24 --> 3966.0789999999997
i trust my senses

3964.72 --> 3967.7599999999998
all right

3966.079 --> 3970.079
i've learned to trust them and i've

3967.76 --> 3972.079
learned to distinguish

3970.079 --> 3974.799
my sensory input

3972.079 --> 3976.079
because i don't always size things up

3974.799 --> 3977.7599999999998
correctly

3976.079 --> 3981.28
but guess what

3977.76 --> 3984.6400000000003
only thing i have to do is let time pass

3981.28 --> 3987.44
reflect upon it look back and then i

3984.64 --> 3992.16
will know if i got it right or not and i

3987.44 --> 3993.119
will be able to reapply that knowledge

3992.16 --> 3996.3999999999996
when i

3993.119 --> 3998.6400000000003
bump into a similar situation similar

3996.4 --> 4000.4
frequency and even if it's slightly off

3998.64 --> 4002.48
i can't adapt to that because then i've

4000.4 --> 4003.359
understood

4002.48 --> 4006.4
yeah

4003.359 --> 4009.92
because i trust my sensories i know what

4006.4 --> 4011.599
i'm doing i'm still alive because of

4009.92 --> 4015.599
them

4011.599 --> 4015.599
because i trusted my senses

4025.039 --> 4029.28
i've seen people

4027.52 --> 4031.92
like get

4029.28 --> 4031.92
destroyed

4032.16 --> 4035.72
because they didn't

4036.16 --> 4041.359
i've had people

4037.599 --> 4045.0
kill themselves that were friends

4041.359 --> 4045.0
because they didn't

4050.48 --> 4054.079
digging in a very far past

4056.079 --> 4060.52
it's nothing recent thank god

4064.799 --> 4068.319
dude what the hell is going on here

4068.48 --> 4072.0
i trust my senses i know what the hell

4070.48 --> 4074.88
i'm talking about when i saw the

4072.0 --> 4077.28
apparition of my mother before i've even

4074.88 --> 4079.119
heard that she was dead

4077.28 --> 4080.96
which i found out

4079.119 --> 4084.079
soon after

4080.96 --> 4086.559
i know it was her

4084.079 --> 4089.6800000000003
i was almost disappointed that there

4086.559 --> 4092.48
wasn't more in the message okay

4089.68 --> 4096.799
but it was all good

4092.48 --> 4096.799
it was unexpectedly good

4098.0 --> 4103.6
that's not mandela effect

4101.6 --> 4106.08
right that how many times do you

4103.6 --> 4108.719
remember something being better

4106.08 --> 4109.92
than you want it to be

4108.719 --> 4113.839
that's

4109.92 --> 4116.719
that just doesn't really even happen

4113.839 --> 4117.839
it never never really does like that

4116.719 --> 4120.0
right

4117.839 --> 4122.4
it's more often that you just

4120.0 --> 4124.159
you think you're going on something

4122.4 --> 4126.5599999999995
and you're having a good time and then

4124.159 --> 4128.639999999999
something is just off and it's just it

4126.56 --> 4130.319
ruins everything it ruins the entire

4128.64 --> 4132.64
trip

4130.319 --> 4133.6
so you just like put it aside you move

4132.64 --> 4135.839
on

4133.6 --> 4138.400000000001
and then you kind of forget

4135.839 --> 4140.719
and then you just remember the entire

4138.4 --> 4142.719
thing as if something good did happen it

4140.719 --> 4144.839
just kind of stays fuzzy

4142.719 --> 4149.6
well that's also mandela effect it's

4144.839 --> 4152.239
again you filling out that blank spot on

4149.6 --> 4154.319
top of the pyramid you have to get it

4152.239 --> 4156.239
you want it straight you have to have it

4154.319 --> 4157.92
straight in your memory if there's no

4156.239 --> 4160.718999999999
capstone

4157.92 --> 4165.279
the mind is restless so your mind fills

4160.719 --> 4165.279
it in that's the mandela effect

4169.759 --> 4175.04
it's a response to aesthetic

4172.719 --> 4176.799
imperfection

4175.04 --> 4181.0
you could state

4176.799 --> 4181.0
it really comes down to that

4197.36 --> 4201.28
right pj cena that's right yeah when

4199.76 --> 4203.92
something like that happens your

4201.28 --> 4205.599999999999
attention is drawn it's like a person is

4203.92 --> 4207.36
coming into the room that you've never

4205.6 --> 4209.120000000001
met before and you're really interested

4207.36 --> 4212.08
in

4209.12 --> 4215.28
so it is like vividly that like i still

4212.08 --> 4217.199
even remember the state of the garden i

4215.28 --> 4219.5199999999995
was in okay

4217.199 --> 4220.799999999999
in the middle of the night three o'clock

4219.52 --> 4224.400000000001
at night

4220.8 --> 4228.719
it's like seven past three or something

4224.4 --> 4228.719
and it was like restless down

4229.28 --> 4233.28
and then suddenly like this white cloud

4231.92 --> 4236.719
just came

4233.28 --> 4239.92
into the garden from inside the house as

4236.719 --> 4241.92
if a person was walking there

4239.92 --> 4243.52
but it wasn't a person it was like a

4241.92 --> 4246.0
white

4243.52 --> 4250.159000000001
veil like cloud

4246.0 --> 4251.84
very subtle no harshness about it no no

4250.159 --> 4253.839999999999
nothing dark

4251.84 --> 4256.96
i've never seen anything like that and

4253.84 --> 4259.4400000000005
then she approached me

4256.96 --> 4262.4
and i didn't feel nervous about that

4259.44 --> 4264.4
then it touched me somehow

4262.4 --> 4266.879999999999
on like my forehead

4264.4 --> 4269.44
and then i snapped into a separate

4266.88 --> 4270.8
vision where i could see my mother's

4269.44 --> 4274.0
face

4270.8 --> 4276.2390000000005
but she was like very young

4274.0 --> 4278.64
like much younger than

4276.239 --> 4281.839999999999
she looked like in her physical body

4278.64 --> 4284.08
like recently it's more like

4281.84 --> 4285.360000000001
she was like 18 or something really

4284.08 --> 4287.679
magical

4285.36 --> 4289.5199999999995
really magical

4287.679 --> 4292.4800000000005
no words

4289.52 --> 4295.120000000001
she did i did not hear like actual

4292.48 --> 4297.919999999999
phonetic words spoken but she spoke to

4295.12 --> 4300.5599999999995
me fully in feelings and she tried to

4297.92 --> 4302.08
reassure me that wow there's so much out

4300.56 --> 4303.04
there

4302.08 --> 4305.28
like

4303.04 --> 4307.6
it's okay

4305.28 --> 4310.32
i'm okay

4307.6 --> 4312.84
you're gonna you're gonna do great kid

4310.32 --> 4318.199
basically that

4312.84 --> 4318.1990000000005
okay and it was really beautiful

4318.6 --> 4324.3
[Music]

4327.59 --> 4330.77
[Music]

4337.76 --> 4340.96
yeah

4339.04 --> 4344.159
they just seen that and it is real it

4340.96 --> 4346.88
was a real experience

4344.159 --> 4350.5599999999995
and i'm not gonna let people's

4346.88 --> 4352.159000000001
freakish paranoia and devil persecution

4350.56 --> 4354.64
lusts

4352.159 --> 4357.5199999999995
and just stubbornness

4354.64 --> 4359.92
take away

4357.52 --> 4362.4800000000005
the pureness of that moment and the

4359.92 --> 4365.04
realizations i got from it because it

4362.48 --> 4366.5599999999995
was a very important moment it was the

4365.04 --> 4368.48
moment that

4366.56 --> 4370.4800000000005
really cemented

4368.48 --> 4371.599999999999
the blood you could say

4370.48 --> 4373.599999999999
of this

4371.6 --> 4377.1990000000005
is real

4373.6 --> 4379.6
there is an afterlife

4377.199 --> 4383.36
that is not just where everything

4379.6 --> 4383.360000000001
becomes completely futile

4383.6 --> 4390.04
there is more

4386.08 --> 4390.04
and i could feel it

4395.27 --> 4403.52
[Music]

4400.48 --> 4403.5199999999995
jesus what the hell

4411.28 --> 4416.239
you are such a gamma

4413.52 --> 4420.719
get the hell

4416.239 --> 4420.718999999999
ah now you're gonna just take a timeout

4421.199 --> 4424.199
sheesh

4442.32 --> 4449.199
all right godzilla so i hope

4445.52 --> 4452.0
you're you're you're gonna let it go now

4449.199 --> 4452.0
i really do

4453.199 --> 4457.28
because at some point if you don't stop

4455.199 --> 4461.96
i'm gonna have to like

4457.28 --> 4461.96
challenge you to a duel effectively

4473.44 --> 4478.12
good thank you very much

4481.11 --> 4484.648999999999
[Music]

4486.56 --> 4490.080000000001
come sit down

4488.239 --> 4494.12
yeah

4490.08 --> 4494.12
no it's all right

4498.48 --> 4501.48
um

4513.36 --> 4517.839999999999
yeah then

4514.719 --> 4517.84
maybe gorzilla

4518.8 --> 4522.1990000000005
you don't know

4530.08 --> 4534.4
i mean i'd we'd be civil

4532.32 --> 4537.199
right that doesn't mean we're gonna i

4534.4 --> 4539.839999999999
don't get along with a lot of people or

4537.199 --> 4539.839999999999
very long

4539.92 --> 4546.159
actually i can't remember even a single

4542.4 --> 4546.159
person that i can be with like

4551.52 --> 4555.76
for

4553.199 --> 4558.239
longer than two days

4555.76 --> 4561.360000000001
without just really urgently needing

4558.239 --> 4563.04
some alone time

4561.36 --> 4564.719
and that's including people that i kind

4563.04 --> 4567.28
of like

4564.719 --> 4570.08
or that i really respect

4567.28 --> 4570.08
so i'm just

4572.08 --> 4576.32
but if it's kind of short yeah i can get

4574.64 --> 4580.679
along with a whole bunch of people as

4576.32 --> 4580.679
long as they can get along with me

4589.52 --> 4594.6
the nerf guns at night noon that's

4591.6 --> 4594.6
hilarious

4596.64 --> 4601.0
that is actually kind of funny

4619.04 --> 4624.64
the shadow of the moon is 70 miles age

4623.28 --> 4627.679
what

4624.64 --> 4629.84
what are you talking about miles

4627.679 --> 4634.08
it's all apparent the moon doesn't have

4629.84 --> 4634.08
an actual size there's no actual

4634.48 --> 4639.12
miles measurement

4636.4 --> 4642.159
like what's your anchoring point

4639.12 --> 4645.679
other than the presuppositional size of

4642.159 --> 4648.0
the moon in the heliocentric model

4645.679 --> 4648.0
i mean

4655.92 --> 4661.04
oh

4657.76 --> 4661.04
shadow smaller than

4662.159 --> 4667.7699999999995
it's all holographic anyway

4664.61 --> 4667.7699999999995
[Music]

4702.32 --> 4705.759999999999
the shadow cannot be smaller than the

4704.159 --> 4708.0
object projecting it that's not

4705.76 --> 4711.04
necessarily true

4708.0 --> 4712.96
godzilla it's complicated but it's all

4711.04 --> 4714.64
based on the assumption they're objects

4712.96 --> 4716.96
and all that

4714.64 --> 4719.4400000000005
but yeah if you have a light bulb it's

4716.96 --> 4721.52
kind of big and you have a disc that's

4719.44 --> 4723.28
like half the diameter of that light

4721.52 --> 4725.92
bulb stuck to it

4723.28 --> 4729.12
yeah the shadow coming from that is

4725.92 --> 4733.679
actually potentially smaller

4729.12 --> 4736.32
because the lights going around it see

4733.679 --> 4738.159
so it's not fully shadowing things up

4736.32 --> 4739.199
then

4738.159 --> 4741.599999999999
but

4739.199 --> 4744.879999999999
that's all based on total physicality

4741.6 --> 4748.76
assumption bias of the celestials anyway

4744.88 --> 4748.76
if you're going to apply that

4772.96 --> 4776.36
what the hell

4778.88 --> 4783.92
box from nathan

4781.6 --> 4783.92
wow

4784.48 --> 4787.599999999999
hey

4785.6 --> 4789.6
leila

4787.6 --> 4793.1990000000005
you should make a video about that you

4789.6 --> 4795.6
seem to have like an entire story arc

4793.199 --> 4797.678999999999
parallel constructed world vision of

4795.6 --> 4799.1990000000005
what it is that i do and what is

4797.679 --> 4801.12
happening over at nathan maybe you

4799.199 --> 4803.44
should write like a science fiction

4801.12 --> 4804.48
novel about that or something sounds

4803.44 --> 4806.799999999999
interesting

4804.48 --> 4807.24
it's very little to do with reality

4806.8 --> 4810.39
though

4815.52 --> 4820.080000000001
nathan botts right

4817.44 --> 4822.638999999999
i mean that's just funny that's funny

4820.08 --> 4825.36
like nathan needs freaking bots

4822.639 --> 4828.08
if anything he's played by anti-flat

4825.36 --> 4828.08
earther bots

4828.48 --> 4832.48
when we don't kick him out all

4830.4 --> 4833.839999999999
but uh

4832.48 --> 4837.04
yeah there's no

4833.84 --> 4837.04
nathan bots

4841.12 --> 4846.88
i mean there is divergent droid these

4843.52 --> 4849.040000000001
days but that's actually a guy

4846.88 --> 4852.719
so

4849.04 --> 4852.719
my camera froze oh really

4857.92 --> 4860.8
all

4858.84 --> 4862.78
right

4860.8 --> 4865.96
thanks for telling me

4862.78 --> 4865.96
[Music]

4866.0 --> 4874.35
no idea how long

4868.25 --> 4874.35
[Music]

4911.52 --> 4916.080000000001
claims without evidence can be dismissed

4913.6 --> 4918.56
without evidence that's right like your

4916.08 --> 4922.48
crazy assertion that nathan has bots

4918.56 --> 4924.8
that are sent over to me

4922.48 --> 4929.638999999999
unless you're literally

4924.8 --> 4929.639
declaring yourself to be a bot

4931.76 --> 4937.360000000001
i mean maybe maybe nathan does have bots

4935.36 --> 4938.96
maybe he made a deal with the anti-flat

4937.36 --> 4940.88
earthers like hey

4938.96 --> 4943.199
please keep coming

4940.88 --> 4945.1990000000005
and nagging everybody

4943.199 --> 4946.879999999999
because that at least keeps them all

4945.199 --> 4949.839999999999
riled up

4946.88 --> 4952.08
and interested right so in that sense

4949.84 --> 4954.32
yeah maybe nathan does have bots and

4952.08 --> 4955.5199999999995
those bots are actually anti-flat

4954.32 --> 4956.84
earthers

4955.52 --> 4961.360000000001
maybe he made a

4956.84 --> 4964.159000000001
deal and i wouldn't even be against that

4961.36 --> 4965.759999999999
i mean even i like to have some trolls

4964.159 --> 4968.5599999999995
just barge in

4965.76 --> 4971.6
and get me riled up so the the my blood

4968.56 --> 4974.159000000001
starts flowing again right

4971.6 --> 4974.159000000001
i get it

4976.0 --> 4981.52
like yeah i mean everybody needs a good

4978.96 --> 4983.84
like whipping slave

4981.52 --> 4988.320000000001
for our entertainment

4983.84 --> 4990.32
like insane raving mad people

4988.32 --> 4992.5599999999995
that you could just like whip

4990.32 --> 4995.679
use for an example

4992.56 --> 4995.679
right it's always nice

4997.76 --> 5002.639
get things going especially when people

4999.76 --> 5004.88
are getting a bit down like dozed off or

5002.639 --> 5007.679
something or lazy

5004.88 --> 5010.08
it's just like having a good little

5007.679 --> 5012.32
freaky nut case

5010.08 --> 5013.44
double speaking funny [ __ ] in your

5012.32 --> 5015.92
chat

5013.44 --> 5017.839999999999
that's ad homing and making up crazy

5015.92 --> 5020.4
parallel construction science fiction

5017.84 --> 5024.88
stories about you yeah it's kind of nice

5020.4 --> 5024.879999999999
to have them around and just use them

5025.28 --> 5029.599999999999
like oh they think they can do all that

5027.44 --> 5031.759999999999
yeah yeah well

5029.6 --> 5034.320000000001
i can do things too

5031.76 --> 5034.320000000001
with you

5034.48 --> 5037.44
huh

5035.44 --> 5039.759999999999
you think you could just show up in my

5037.44 --> 5043.199
chat and i wouldn't

5039.76 --> 5045.97
like start to highlight you or

5043.199 --> 5047.44
reveal what you really are

5045.97 --> 5049.52
[Music]

5047.44 --> 5052.5599999999995
how your lies work

5049.52 --> 5055.360000000001
how twisted you actually are as a person

5052.56 --> 5057.76
to even be doing something like this

5055.36 --> 5060.0
yeah and then the natural consequences

5057.76 --> 5061.92
what will the prices be that you pay in

5060.0 --> 5062.96
your life

5061.92 --> 5065.84
all these

5062.96 --> 5066.88
nice little bonuses

5065.84 --> 5069.52
right

5066.88 --> 5071.84
it's all because you come in the chat

5069.52 --> 5071.84
layla

5080.32 --> 5084.639
the 30 flat earthers here and they're

5082.0 --> 5086.96
not hitting i don't give a [ __ ]

5084.639 --> 5089.04
besides they're not all flat earthers

5086.96 --> 5091.28
i've got a lot of anti-flat earthers

5089.04 --> 5093.92
following me that are obsessed with me

5091.28 --> 5096.96
because they think i'm satan

5093.92 --> 5101.4400000000005
and well to be fair

5096.96 --> 5105.52
towards them i'm yeah i might just be

5101.44 --> 5105.5199999999995
i might just be it that's right

5107.199 --> 5112.32
to them though

5109.92 --> 5113.52
to them specifically

5112.32 --> 5116.5599999999995
huh

5113.52 --> 5120.159000000001
so yeah they like to kind of like

5116.56 --> 5123.52
stick around and get all like swarming

5120.159 --> 5125.199
it's like they're in the plague

5123.52 --> 5126.8
right

5125.199 --> 5129.12
they're the plague and i'm i'm the

5126.8 --> 5131.52
walker and they're surrounding me

5129.12 --> 5133.84
they're like a swarm of

5131.52 --> 5136.080000000001
ravenous insects but they can't really

5133.84 --> 5138.8
chew for through my skin so they just

5136.08 --> 5141.28
attack everything that approaches me

5138.8 --> 5143.84
it really does feel sometimes like i'm

5141.28 --> 5146.639
diablo or something i'm just walking and

5143.84 --> 5148.88
like these anti-flat earthers spawn in

5146.639 --> 5150.400000000001
my path and just everybody has to then

5148.88 --> 5152.719
slay them

5150.4 --> 5155.719
right but it really does feel like that

5152.719 --> 5155.719
sometimes

5163.92 --> 5167.52
right because

5165.28 --> 5169.04
flat earthers have their own little

5167.52 --> 5171.040000000001
weird

5169.04 --> 5173.84
dwelling path

5171.04 --> 5176.239
and little magical thinking trixies that

5173.84 --> 5179.04
they're getting all invested in that is

5176.239 --> 5181.12
gonna be a giant way to bog them down

5179.04 --> 5183.5199999999995
and actually make them fail later

5181.12 --> 5185.12
they're all dealing with that right now

5183.52 --> 5187.1990000000005
so yeah

5185.12 --> 5190.239
our win

5187.199 --> 5193.04
so yeah i say things about flat earthers

5190.239 --> 5196.0
you know i kind of pointed how

5193.04 --> 5198.639
freaking useless some of you can be and

5196.0 --> 5201.04
how deluded you can be when you think

5198.639 --> 5203.76
that just because you know the earth is

5201.04 --> 5206.4
flat and can argue it to a decent level

5203.76 --> 5207.84
that now suddenly you you can just know

5206.4 --> 5210.5599999999995
everything

5207.84 --> 5212.719
and that some idea you gain

5210.56 --> 5216.88
is just the truth and you just like a

5212.719 --> 5219.76
sport try to defend it without actually

5216.88 --> 5222.56
even prioritizing figuring out whether

5219.76 --> 5224.96
it is true or not it's just like yo

5222.56 --> 5228.2390000000005
yeah you got the training so why not

5224.96 --> 5230.2390000000005
just make up some [ __ ] story and

5228.239 --> 5231.12
make it your thing

5230.239 --> 5234.0
i mean

5231.12 --> 5236.8
apparently irwin does it with his

5234.0 --> 5239.76
holographic celestials and

5236.8 --> 5242.88
right i just make that [ __ ] up

5239.76 --> 5244.88
so he's just projecting why can't we

5242.88 --> 5247.679
make [ __ ] up

5244.88 --> 5250.0
well because

5247.679 --> 5250.88
you have to still actually then test it

5250.0 --> 5254.4
and

5250.88 --> 5256.08
like highlight what is this idea how

5254.4 --> 5259.5199999999995
real could it be

5256.08 --> 5261.76
how could it turn out not to be real

5259.52 --> 5264.320000000001
and then be honest about that and then

5261.76 --> 5267.1990000000005
keep comparing i don't see a lot of flat

5264.32 --> 5269.759999999999
earthers doing that

5267.199 --> 5273.919999999999
much just gonna end up

5269.76 --> 5277.6
watching some weird flat earth adjacent

5273.92 --> 5279.76
conspiracy video with like more weirdest

5277.6 --> 5282.08
like oh look at these baseless

5279.76 --> 5283.52
assertions that we've discovered we can

5282.08 --> 5286.32
assert now

5283.52 --> 5287.84
oh look at the new baseless assertions

5286.32 --> 5290.32
came in guys

5287.84 --> 5292.719
get ready to dig in

5290.32 --> 5294.48
yeah that's what a lot of flat earthers

5292.719 --> 5295.92
do now

5294.48 --> 5298.959999999999
because

5295.92 --> 5301.679
they're kind of getting used to dealing

5298.96 --> 5304.32
with ballers and anti-flag directors and

5301.679 --> 5304.32
i guess they're

5305.12 --> 5310.159
getting kind of bogged down so they just

5307.199 --> 5312.5599999999995
want to move on they want more

5310.159 --> 5316.08
of that all the discovery yeah well at

5312.56 --> 5317.120000000001
some point the discovery kind of stops

5316.08 --> 5320.719
right

5317.12 --> 5322.5599999999995
you can't just be an awakening junkie

5320.719 --> 5324.719
if you're not going to build how are you

5322.56 --> 5327.6
going to grow

5324.719 --> 5329.84
grow within the ascension if you don't

5327.6 --> 5331.76
have the roots

5329.84 --> 5333.6
if it's just oh it's just the growth

5331.76 --> 5335.84
process what growth

5333.6 --> 5336.8
so then after you die because it doesn't

5335.84 --> 5339.4400000000005
matter

5336.8 --> 5343.6
or do you actually want to build up so

5339.44 --> 5346.5599999999995
that you actually can hold on

5343.6 --> 5348.159000000001
to the ascension and not just grow for

5346.56 --> 5351.84
this court of it

5348.159 --> 5351.839999999999
without any purpose

5352.32 --> 5356.239
right

5354.0 --> 5359.36
i mean awakening

5356.239 --> 5361.678999999999
at the start is quite a thrill

5359.36 --> 5366.32
but after that it mostly is just a

5361.679 --> 5369.12
burden a burden that is really necessary

5366.32 --> 5373.759999999999
you learn to deal with and carry

5369.12 --> 5373.76
because if you don't everybody's [ __ ]

5374.56 --> 5379.52
and you can literally feel that as

5376.719 --> 5382.719
somebody like relinquishes their burden

5379.52 --> 5386.56
everybody around them gets cursed have

5382.719 --> 5389.6
you ever noticed that when that happens

5386.56 --> 5393.679
when somebody actually lays it down for

5389.6 --> 5394.719
real it curses everybody there's a shock

5393.679 --> 5397.6
wave

5394.719 --> 5400.08
through frequency and it influences

5397.6 --> 5402.96
everybody around them everybody that's

5400.08 --> 5404.719
invested is going to be poisoned

5402.96 --> 5408.0
spiritually

5404.719 --> 5410.8
yeah that's why awakening is not just oh

5408.0 --> 5413.04
the rush of the latest newest brilliant

5410.8 --> 5416.2390000000005
insight oh i'm tripping again no it's

5413.04 --> 5418.4
actually about figuring out what is real

5416.239 --> 5420.239
how does this work how can i get a grip

5418.4 --> 5423.5199999999995
on this in my mind especially in

5420.239 --> 5426.5599999999995
different states and then what burden

5423.52 --> 5428.4800000000005
need id to carry

5426.56 --> 5431.1990000000005
and keep carrying

5428.48 --> 5434.48
that's the real

5431.199 --> 5436.5599999999995
the really is level of the awakening

5434.48 --> 5441.199
it's not just about the rush of the

5436.56 --> 5441.1990000000005
discovery it's about the task

5441.52 --> 5448.88
if you don't do it disaster

5445.679 --> 5451.52
because if you awaken you better pay up

5448.88 --> 5453.6
for it because if you don't the devil

5451.52 --> 5455.84
will come collecting

5453.6 --> 5457.679
because you awaken still

5455.84 --> 5459.92
if you don't take the responsibility

5457.679 --> 5464.639
when you do that then the devil will

5459.92 --> 5464.639
come collecting it works like that

5469.679 --> 5473.36
dude

5470.639 --> 5476.36
stop spamming in my chat you dumb

5473.36 --> 5476.36
troll

5482.56 --> 5487.4800000000005
yeah layla ain't projecting no more

5501.199 --> 5506.879999999999
what is

5502.84 --> 5508.88
this why doesn't it say anymore

5506.88 --> 5511.679
whether somebody's timed out or banned

5508.88 --> 5511.679
this is weird

5516.239 --> 5521.12
might be just temporary youtube glitch

5518.48 --> 5522.879999999999
oh damn it

5521.12 --> 5528.08
it's a show already

5522.88 --> 5530.32
jesus time has flown holy [ __ ]

5528.08 --> 5533.76
i guess i was kind of riled up today and

5530.32 --> 5536.4
time has flown by quite fast i'm

5533.76 --> 5538.719
kind of stunned i didn't expect it to be

5536.4 --> 5541.719
like one hour one and a half hour later

5538.719 --> 5541.719
already

5546.88 --> 5551.12
want to go hey borders boy

5549.12 --> 5553.199
want me to go into more detail what i

5551.12 --> 5555.04
talked about today concerning the

5553.199 --> 5557.28
mandela effect or concerning my

5555.04 --> 5559.12
experience with my mother

5557.28 --> 5560.719
or

5559.12 --> 5564.719
yeah

5560.719 --> 5567.04
about the awakening in general

5564.719 --> 5568.4800000000005
i can talk about all those things if the

5567.04 --> 5570.159
conditions are right and people are

5568.48 --> 5573.919999999999
actually listening because everybody's

5570.159 --> 5577.12
dozing off it's not gonna roll you see

5573.92 --> 5579.12
chat has to get rolling first like this

5577.12 --> 5580.639
like this right now

5579.12 --> 5582.32
even if there's some trolls in there it

5580.639 --> 5584.8
doesn't matter it has to actually keep

5582.32 --> 5586.799999999999
rolling and then i can do it then i can

5584.8 --> 5588.400000000001
do it right

5586.8 --> 5591.6
if everyone's if there's like five

5588.4 --> 5594.719
minutes pause and nothing is happening i

5591.6 --> 5598.400000000001
can't do it you understand i

5594.719 --> 5598.4
physically can't do it

5599.12 --> 5604.719
i'm able to do it because of the energy

5601.92 --> 5604.719
that's flowing

5604.8 --> 5612.159000000001
it just doesn't work any other way

5608.0 --> 5612.159
right anyway thanks everyone for coming

5613.679 --> 5618.4800000000005

nathan well i think nathan is mostly

5618.48 --> 5624.32
like on the same position as that i am

5620.56 --> 5624.320000000001
