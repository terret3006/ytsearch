yesterday

106.32 --> 113.6
very cloudy a couple of clear spots in

109.119 --> 116.96
between but mostly cloudy and rainy

113.6 --> 119.52
too so yesterday

116.96 --> 122.079
it rained a lot

119.52 --> 124.24
and i went out for groceries

122.079 --> 126.32
like an hour ago and it also kind of

124.24 --> 127.28
rained but not really hard so i didn't

126.32 --> 131.119
get

127.28 --> 131.119
overly wet or anything but

131.28 --> 136.56
yeah it seems like it's a bit of a rainy

133.599 --> 136.56
period right now

137.68 --> 143.84
i hope that the nice weather will return

140.959 --> 143.84
soon

144.71 --> 147.83
[Music]

156.48 --> 162.39999999999998
hello vladimir sage first in chat

159.28 --> 165.36
jeff gashat good to see you

162.4 --> 165.36
pjc net

165.519 --> 171.56
it is tuesday the 24th of march 2022

173.27 --> 176.36
[Applause]

179.36 --> 182.36
right

188.48 --> 195.92
so yeah i feel pretty good

192.08 --> 199.76000000000002
a bit of a shock this morning though

195.92 --> 201.92
because i was just eating a croissant

199.76 --> 204.959
and then i suddenly noticed like what

201.92 --> 204.95899999999997
something weird here

205.12 --> 211.76
and then like a pretty yeah big chunk of

208.72 --> 213.44
my tooth broke off or well it was

211.76 --> 215.599
already broken off apparently i don't

213.44 --> 217.599
know exactly when it happened but it

215.599 --> 219.04
kind of came loose and was like oh

217.599 --> 220.79899999999998
[ __ ]

219.04 --> 223.599
happy that didn't like happen in the

220.799 --> 223.59900000000002
middle of the night

224.56 --> 230.64000000000001
that didn't like swallow it or anything

226.959 --> 230.64000000000001
but yeah that was a bit of a shocker

231.04 --> 235.599
very distracting

233.439 --> 238.07999999999998
but yeah nothing painful or anything

235.599 --> 239.83999999999997
it's just like ah

238.08 --> 241.68
it was basically the tooth that already

239.84 --> 244.31900000000002
had a part broken off

241.68 --> 247.84
another part broke off now but i can

244.319 --> 249.83999999999997
literally still eat with it so

247.84 --> 252.239
it is distracting

249.84 --> 253.04
it does make me nervous in general

252.239 --> 255.20000000000002
like

253.04 --> 257.28
yeah

255.2 --> 259.359
but

257.28 --> 261.75899999999996
at some point i will go to a dentist

259.359 --> 264.15999999999997
with it to see if he can like fix it up

261.759 --> 264.16
a bit

266.72 --> 269.68
because

267.6 --> 272.35
i'm mostly afraid that it it'll just

269.68 --> 273.6
like start cutting on my tongue

272.35 --> 275.759
[Music]

273.6 --> 278.88
on the side of it

275.759 --> 280.56
but that was my fear even before with

278.88 --> 283.84
the previous situation when it was

280.56 --> 283.84
already kind of a bit of a hazard

284.08 --> 286.96
it's not gone worse it's actually better

285.919 --> 288.0
than that

286.96 --> 289.52
but

288.0 --> 291.68
anyway

289.52 --> 293.03999999999996
that's kind of distracting me right now

291.68 --> 297.479
but

293.04 --> 297.47900000000004
other than that i feel pretty good

309.039 --> 311.84
dent

314.16 --> 317.16
okay

324.639 --> 326.96000000000004
right

328.72 --> 332.72
yeah the most of the problem that i have

330.96 --> 334.79999999999995
is that i just don't really have enough

332.72 --> 336.8
money

334.8 --> 339.52000000000004
to really go to the dentist to start

336.8 --> 342.8
fixing things

339.52 --> 342.79999999999995
so i just have to make do

343.759 --> 348.56
right at least nothing's hurting i can

345.919 --> 352.15999999999997
still just eat with it fine

348.56 --> 355.28000000000003
i think it probably happened because

352.16 --> 355.28000000000003
the way the pressure

355.44 --> 360.08
was kind of divided that it was pushing

357.68 --> 363.44
on one particular point

360.08 --> 365.19899999999996
that then eventually just broke off

363.44 --> 367.6
it probably like happened somewhere

365.199 --> 369.759
yesterday evening or something i didn't

367.6 --> 372.08000000000004
even notice

369.759 --> 372.08000000000004
weird

375.44 --> 379.36
ah

377.52 --> 382.71999999999997
right so yeah don't worry too much about

379.36 --> 382.72
that i try not to

384.91 --> 388.069
[Music]

388.16 --> 393.16
all right so yeah yesterday's show was

389.84 --> 393.15999999999997
pretty good

394.319 --> 399.199
very satisfied about the way that i

396.16 --> 399.199
conducted myself

400.24 --> 405.12
also the flat earth debates was also

402.72 --> 406.96000000000004
very good the live show was excellent it

405.12 --> 409.12
was there all of the way

406.96 --> 411.52
and the after show was also good but

409.12 --> 411.52
short

411.759 --> 414.16
it's like

414.479 --> 419.919
40 minutes or something

417.44 --> 423.84
but yeah every moment of it was really

419.919 --> 423.84
good and everybody was really focused

425.52 --> 428.24
so

426.56 --> 433.0
it was an interesting show i think i

428.24 --> 433.0
wonder what today's show will be like

436.4 --> 441.75899999999996
uh

438.72 --> 441.759
right what else

446.24 --> 453.039
yeah made by jim bob had a great stream

449.36 --> 456.08000000000004
and a whole bunch of upload clips

453.039 --> 457.919
but yeah stream was great again

456.08 --> 460.4
i was quite in the flow but yeah i

457.919 --> 463.4
didn't really feel like trying to get on

460.4 --> 463.4
again

464.16 --> 469.28000000000003
i love hanging around in chat there and

466.08 --> 469.28
just doing my thing

472.08 --> 475.4
what else

478.8 --> 482.40000000000003
oh yeah watch some own benjamin

485.039 --> 490.44
but yeah most of that i actually watched

487.199 --> 490.44
this morning

494.879 --> 501.199
right and i think that's pretty much it

497.039 --> 501.199
also watch the blake 7 and all that

503.039 --> 506.599
hey tony whitcomb

526.08 --> 532.76
right so yeah

528.64 --> 532.76
what's the temperature actually

532.85 --> 539.2
[Music]

537.2 --> 541.76
14 yeah yeah i thought it was a lot

539.2 --> 541.76
chillier

547.519 --> 549.839
anyway

551.92 --> 555.8389999999999
hey elise g good to see you

561.6 --> 564.88
right

562.48 --> 567.36
somebody linked me up yesterday to this

564.88 --> 570.64
metal video

567.36 --> 573.279
i thought it was actually really good

570.64 --> 576.399
it was it was dark though i didn't like

573.279 --> 579.12
that but like it's the text

576.399 --> 580.64
it's actually good i left a comment

579.12 --> 583.53
there

580.64 --> 586.659
so thanks for linking me up on that

583.53 --> 586.659
[Music]

593.05 --> 597.29
[Music]

599.519 --> 604.5600000000001
yeah

601.68 --> 607.04
have you ever seen the fifth element

604.56 --> 607.04
of course

608.399 --> 612.16
oh yeah not necessarily of course but

610.72 --> 614.64
yeah i did

612.16 --> 617.04
like that was a real big hype

614.64 --> 618.48
for me that i pretty much got into

617.04 --> 621.4399999999999
immediately

618.48 --> 621.44
i love that movie

623.12 --> 630.0
it was like a weird movie that was like

626.24 --> 633.2
very silly but also very silly serious

630.0 --> 634.64
at the same time really odd like really

633.2 --> 638.36
odd

634.64 --> 638.36
but very interesting

657.44 --> 661.9200000000001
amazing opera

659.6 --> 663.839
yeah the opera was pretty cool until

661.92 --> 665.76
they started to get all weird with the

663.839 --> 668.1600000000001
voice and that i thought was actually

665.76 --> 671.279
kind of annoying in cache

668.16 --> 671.279
so i didn't like that

673.44 --> 677.839
multipass

674.72 --> 680.64
yeah yeah lilo multipass

677.839 --> 683.8800000000001
yeah i got that meme on d live

680.64 --> 683.88
as a sticker

688.959 --> 692.5189999999999
that's pretty awesome

702.399 --> 707.68
score was excellent

704.959 --> 709.5999999999999
yeah lilu was

707.68 --> 712.399
pretty hot

709.6 --> 714.32
and uh but i also really liked the

712.399 --> 719.2
villain guy

714.32 --> 721.12
like the cyber hitler you could call him

719.2 --> 723.839
he did kind of look like that i thought

721.12 --> 727.2
he was amazing in this in the entire

723.839 --> 727.2
thing it was just amazing

728.0 --> 730.399
what an

728.839 --> 733.399
actor

730.399 --> 733.399
yeah

746.32 --> 750.6
want to watch it again now okay well

748.16 --> 751.8389999999999
nobody's stopping you

750.6 --> 754.0
[Music]

751.839 --> 757.32
i think i got it on dvd

754.0 --> 757.32
not sure

760.63 --> 763.72
[Music]

765.68 --> 771.959
bruce willis has gone downhill yeah

768.959 --> 771.959
absolutely

772.639 --> 777.04
it's like

774.079 --> 777.04
he hollowed out

777.2 --> 783.36
for the time when the less

780.32 --> 785.44
like he lost his spunk energy or

783.36 --> 787.519
whatever you're gonna call that

785.44 --> 789.519
so he's just like yeah i'm bruce willis

787.519 --> 792.16
i'm just like the old bruce willis

789.519 --> 794.72
except i don't do anything

792.16 --> 798.24
that's interesting anymore

794.72 --> 801.2
it doesn't have that natural

798.24 --> 803.44
impulsive spunk that i could detect in

801.2 --> 806.1600000000001
this like

803.44 --> 810.6800000000001
the later the movie the less he has it

806.16 --> 810.68
it's just not really interesting anymore

827.76 --> 832.76
oh

829.279 --> 832.76
okay tony

846.8 --> 850.639
gary oldman that's yeah that's the guy

850.88 --> 856.0
gary oldman is pretty much

853.12 --> 859.199
kick ass in every movie he's in if you

856.0 --> 862.639
can spot him that is actually him

859.199 --> 867.04
he's a really like deep

862.639 --> 867.04
deep dive character type actor

867.839 --> 870.839
um

877.36 --> 880.36
anyway

887.04 --> 890.88
gary is good in the film leon

895.6 --> 899.839
was he in there

897.199 --> 899.8389999999999
no remember

914.399 --> 916.56
whatever

914.98 --> 920.279
[Music]

916.56 --> 920.279
right so yeah

935.44 --> 940.0
see the cup in there

937.92 --> 941.759
man it's such a long time ago since i

940.0 --> 946.16
saw that movie

941.759 --> 946.16
don't particularly care to watch it back

946.639 --> 952.16
there's a lot of things that were just

949.04 --> 952.16
like off and

953.36 --> 959.04
well it's probably widely known

956.079 --> 961.199
that it was basically like borderline

959.04 --> 963.519
pedo and all that

961.199 --> 965.4399999999999
that very young girl and all that is

963.519 --> 967.279
like

965.44 --> 969.839
it's like yeah from a liberal

967.279 --> 972.32
perspective you could say it's kind of

969.839 --> 974.48
innocent but yeah as soon as you turn

972.32 --> 977.12
that off you just see like yeah this is

974.48 --> 980.12
really just like

977.12 --> 980.12
yak

982.399 --> 986.32
even though it was like a pretty

984.399 --> 988.56
well-acted

986.32 --> 989.6800000000001
movie

988.56 --> 990.88
it's just

989.68 --> 994.16
brabus

990.88 --> 994.16
got involved i think

995.68 --> 998.959
right anyway

997.6 --> 1002.36
don't really want to talk about that

998.959 --> 1002.3599999999999
movie thanks

1029.12 --> 1033.28
there's another movie that has like some

1031.199 --> 1035.52
of the same actors i wonder if any of

1033.28 --> 1036.959
you have ever heard of it

1035.52 --> 1038.799
now i have to remember what it's

1036.959 --> 1040.799
actually called

1038.799 --> 1043.199
it's a lesser known movie

1040.799 --> 1044.4
it's very long though i might have it on

1043.199 --> 1047.1200000000001
dvd

1044.4 --> 1050.8390000000002
otherwise now i should have it on dvd

1047.12 --> 1050.839
hold on let me check

1093.039 --> 1096.96
a lot of people apparently didn't like

1095.039 --> 1100.8799999999999
it i liked it

1096.96 --> 1100.88
it's a multi-language movie

1107.36 --> 1110.7199999999998
i had some

1108.48 --> 1113.6
yeah called blueberry

1110.72 --> 1113.6000000000001
you ever heard of that

1115.2 --> 1119.679
like this

1116.4 --> 1120.799
is very trippy movie

1119.679 --> 1122.88
it's like

1120.799 --> 1124.72
sort of a western thing but it's

1122.88 --> 1127.7600000000002
multilingual there's some french and

1124.72 --> 1130.32
some german and english in there and

1127.76 --> 1132.799
like this native american language

1130.32 --> 1133.84
and it is about like

1132.799 --> 1137.52
well

1133.84 --> 1140.0
it seems pretty much like dmt like

1137.52 --> 1141.44
experience and it's really surreal with

1140.0 --> 1143.76
that

1141.44 --> 1147.2
i thought it was extremely fascinated

1143.76 --> 1147.2
the way that they basically

1147.679 --> 1152.799
designed the hallucinations for that

1149.52 --> 1154.72
which were cgi but it was like

1152.799 --> 1156.799
like there's something to it because

1154.72 --> 1159.2
it's not literally like that but in a

1156.799 --> 1162.96
way it is

1159.2 --> 1166.16
like the the fractal pattern-ness of the

1162.96 --> 1167.919
experience was very well expressed

1166.16 --> 1168.72
within it

1167.919 --> 1171.1200000000001
so

1168.72 --> 1173.28
if you've never seen this yeah it's a

1171.12 --> 1177.039
supernatural experience

1173.28 --> 1179.44

1177.039 --> 1181.679
