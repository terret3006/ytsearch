278.63 --> 286.07
it's a crowded fan oh I see 76 watching

282.33 --> 286.07
wow that was quick

289.58 --> 303.95
hoagie tailors hello spare you room

296.85 --> 308.16
music so yeah I'm just gonna be bold and

303.95 --> 310.44
basically call awliya and no Aaron

308.16 --> 313.72900000000004
Armstrong you can stop skyping me now

310.44 --> 313.729
I'm not unbanning you

328.71 --> 386.75899999999996
let's get in yeah hang out that's the

344.49 --> 388.83000000000004
reason I was indeed and one of the funny

386.759 --> 390.99
things too that I started to notice is a

388.83 --> 394.909
mechanism that I've been using from the

390.99 --> 398.13
start but from an honest position namely

394.909 --> 400.5
just trying to build but they're using

398.13 --> 402.449
it against us like they're making these

400.5 --> 405.93
claims and then they're trying to force

402.449 --> 409.08000000000004
us to prove our claim now I love to make

405.93 --> 412.65000000000003
certain assertions concepts all that and

409.08 --> 415.8
then explain how things could be proven

412.65 --> 418.38
if anybody's interested not actually

415.8 --> 420.539
saying this is true just saying this is

418.38 --> 422.4
how you could and that is one of the

420.539 --> 425.4
ways that I'm trying to go about because

422.4 --> 427.04999999999995
yeah I'm just a guy in this room have

425.4 --> 430.10999999999996
been for most of the time yeah now I do

427.05 --> 432.72
have a camera of course and I have I can

430.11 --> 434.639
do research and learn about things but

432.72 --> 436.77000000000004
it's a very effective method to get

434.639 --> 438.33
around and get things done it's just

436.77 --> 441.84
putting it out there in the open the

438.33 --> 443.88
plan and for anyone to take and do but

441.84 --> 447.02
the ballers they kind of like that I

443.88 --> 452.07
think and they're trying to make us

447.02 --> 454.919
create their evidence for them kind of

452.07 --> 456.96
almost by accident trying to trick us in

454.919 --> 459.44
doing their slave labor for their

456.96 --> 459.44
religion

463.67 --> 469.07
I can hear you fine but it could be that

466.22 --> 472.48
the overall audio output is not

469.07 --> 472.48
fantastic wait

472.81 --> 481.01
speak up again yes yes okay yeah you are

479.12 --> 482.78000000000003
very low in volume I think it's only

481.01 --> 485.63
coming through my microphone this is not

482.78 --> 491.80999999999995
good I don't know I need may might need

485.63 --> 496.48
to create a separate audio source on the

491.81 --> 500.75
go anyway I'll try to amp up the volume

496.48 --> 506.0
more input audio divide ten decibels

500.75 --> 508.82
should be something okay so I am a lot

506.0 --> 518.419
louder where I think you speak up if you

508.82 --> 522.71
go in now I have the problem is is now

518.419 --> 526.13
my microphone is just very loud but

522.71 --> 528.59
there's no separate audio source for the

526.13 --> 531.28
skype and I need to build that for a

528.59 --> 537.64
moment because I haven't made it yet

531.28 --> 537.64
audio so how do input audio

540.52 --> 545.3389999999999
know what

551.69 --> 557.089
today - what

557.84 --> 569.24
oh damn it it's not working okay it's so

564.29 --> 586.67
no audio input how do I get this

569.24 --> 589.49
I haven't installed audio banana so it's

586.67 --> 591.74
what I'm hearing but OBS only is

589.49 --> 594.55
registering my microphone now for some

591.74 --> 603.86
reason is not taking into account Skype

594.55 --> 605.87
it's yeah wait maybe I can because it

603.86 --> 618.47
has a window capture but window capture

605.87 --> 624.47
doesn't imply sound okay okay I could do

618.47 --> 627.07
that think yeah I need air is no other

624.47 --> 627.07
place too

632.77 --> 639.0699999999999
right and it'll just be you seeing it as

637.029 --> 644.97
well so that's better okay

639.07 --> 644.97
so right I mean this is my Skype source

663.51 --> 674.62
desktop

664.69 --> 676.6600000000001
yeah that's audio input capture that's

674.62 --> 680.37
coming in through the microphone that's

676.66 --> 680.37
what people on YouTube are hearing

695.19 --> 720.279
that's right yep turning on I don't know

714.459 --> 722.8199999999999
I have no idea just properties see

720.279 --> 722.82
device

730.019 --> 741.999
that's not ball you'll change that to

733.68 --> 744.9699999999999
default maybe okay so okay yeah it's

741.999 --> 746.139
working hey so you must have had it set

744.97 --> 747.8190000000001
to some and they should hear me now

746.139 --> 749.319
properly so if you check in sky in chat

747.819 --> 753.939
now and see can they hear me yeah that's

749.319 --> 757.059
it speak again but thank you that's

753.939 --> 758.5889999999999
where your skype is all right okay sorry

757.059 --> 766.42
put mine a little lower

758.589 --> 767.7090000000001
yeah too low it's just maximum is fine

766.42 --> 770.29
and yours

767.709 --> 771.9699999999999
turn down a little so speak up one two

770.29 --> 773.949
three four five six seven eight nine

771.97 --> 777.1
yeah that's about right is about right

773.949 --> 778.93
yeah okay let's just do a sound check

777.1 --> 782.6800000000001
ins in Skype is that working guys in

778.93 --> 785.529
this chat yeah this album rocker says

782.68 --> 787.3889999999999
it's perfect now alright ex well thank

785.529 --> 791.74
you for participating in that sound

787.389 --> 793.36
check and yeah let's continue so let me

791.74 --> 796.9300000000001
just address lofty don't tell the truth

793.36 --> 798.519
about why that's gone let me deal with

796.93 --> 800.41
it right don't tell the truth about

798.519 --> 802.839
sleeping worry a begging for cash right

800.41 --> 804.55
I haven't eat begged for cash so where's

802.839 --> 806.4390000000001
the truth in that Lahti stop being a

804.55 --> 809.079
dick or threesomes on through it on

806.439 --> 811.0
Facebook well whether there are or are

809.079 --> 813.699
not threesomes on Facebook that's in

811.0 --> 815.889
that's invading my privacy and whether

813.699 --> 817.449
it was or was not true I wouldn't be

815.889 --> 819.5790000000001
commenting on it because it's like

817.449 --> 821.41
outside of the YouTube guidelines and

819.579 --> 822.7589999999999
you shouldn't be doing it because we all

821.41 --> 825.759
know that you're not allowed to invade

822.759 --> 827.379
one's private wealth on YouTube unless

825.759 --> 828.819
the rules don't apply it's a lottery in

827.379 --> 831.4590000000001
which case you can do whatever you want

828.819 --> 832.899
but let's be honest it's got nothing to

831.459 --> 835.0889999999999
do with the shape of the earth so

832.899 --> 836.829
whether it's true or not true I will not

835.089 --> 839.1700000000001
ever comment on my private world for

836.829 --> 842.1099999999999
obvious reasons and you're addicted ly

839.17 --> 843.91
bringing it up so what's the craic Lahti

842.11 --> 847.0500000000001
in fact actually yeah timed amount well

843.91 --> 850.38
done lofty stop being a dick

847.05 --> 852.3599999999999
but that's what he does I don't get it

850.38 --> 854.04
what stuff is it is it the fact that you

852.36 --> 855.51
guys have that Booker that you realize

854.04 --> 857.0699999999999
that you're on teaching in the National

855.51 --> 858.63
Curriculum is unlawful and that you have

857.07 --> 860.85
to were try and slow me in any possible

858.63 --> 862.56
way you can do you know what if you

860.85 --> 864.0
could see the video Lottie that would be

862.56 --> 867.03
far better than seeing the stuff on

864.0 --> 869.36
Facebook I think that lot is not even

867.03 --> 872.0699999999999
reaching that level really I think that

869.36 --> 874.35
he's not even getting what's going on

872.07 --> 876.75
he's just fooling around like a kid in

874.35 --> 879.36
between adults doing things yeah he's

876.75 --> 881.91
nice to me I used to be when I was a kid

879.36 --> 884.5500000000001
and was being very enthusiastic trying

881.91 --> 886.92
to work along didn't really get what my

884.55 --> 889.05
parents were doing or the consequences

886.92 --> 891.2099999999999
of it but it was just trying to tag

889.05 --> 893.4
along and I think that's what lot is

891.21 --> 896.36
doing in his own way he hasn't really

893.4 --> 901.77
shown that he understands anything

896.36 --> 903.78
really barely look about the sx0 says

901.77 --> 906.48
you don't need to beg where can I give

903.78 --> 908.1899999999999
you money for your work well see if I

906.48 --> 910.02
respond to that now people will say oh

908.19 --> 911.6400000000001
he's begging for money but there's a

910.02 --> 912.9
link in that in every description box on

911.64 --> 914.91
the heart on the live things and there

912.9 --> 916.74
it's there subtly so that if you happen

914.91 --> 919.05
to read the description the link in the

916.74 --> 920.97
description it's there now I'm only

919.05 --> 923.37
mentioning it because lotty's doing a

920.97 --> 924.99
massive job but promoting it for me so

923.37 --> 927.8100000000001
thanks to Lottie for pointing out the

924.99 --> 929.76
doing the begging for me and I don't ask

927.81 --> 933.6899999999999
for any money and but what I do want to

929.76 --> 935.37
mention is that a be science and all of

933.69 --> 937.2
the ball earthers have all got patreon

935.37 --> 939.48
accounts they've all got super chats and

937.2 --> 941.19
no one complains about that do you you

939.48 --> 943.71
don't point out the hypocrisy in your

941.19 --> 945.5100000000001
comments I don't ask for any money right

943.71 --> 946.86
I've never asked for money I've never

945.51 --> 949.08
took a penny out Flat Earth

946.86 --> 950.58
I did take money on ago for me for a

949.08 --> 953.97
particular course which you've all seen

950.58 --> 955.95
has happened and I don't have any money

953.97 --> 957.6
coming in from Flat Earth but that also

955.95 --> 959.7
has the effect that it means that I

957.6 --> 961.89
don't spend as much time on fly if as

959.7 --> 963.33
what I could do and but I don't think

961.89 --> 966.06
that anybody should be making money out

963.33 --> 969.6
of life including bowlers so let's not

966.06 --> 973.65
be hypocritical so I so you think that

969.6 --> 975.6
I'm doing bad by asking my own personal

973.65 --> 978.18
view is that this should be a topic of

975.6 --> 980.46
interest right now if you rate making

978.18 --> 982.0799999999999
regular content like Nathan does like

980.46 --> 983.7900000000001
windows like even like people that I

982.08 --> 985.89
disagree with if they do regular content

983.79 --> 987.5999999999999
and provide a service it's right that

985.89 --> 989.61
they get compensated in some way at a

987.6 --> 992.01
time because it is time it is effort

989.61 --> 995.22
it's hard work it's internet and it's

992.01 --> 998.0699999999999
been occasion yeah you know focus your

995.22 --> 1003.2
energy on it and you can't just step

998.07 --> 1005.12
away and it's not like some some toy you

1003.2 --> 1008.2700000000001
could just step away from and get back

1005.12 --> 1010.13
to later no staying focused on all this

1008.27 --> 1012.23
science on what's going on on the

1010.13 --> 1014.63
psychological warfare to stay properly

1012.23 --> 1017.39
in the zone stay up to par with the

1014.63 --> 1019.37
skills being wielded that requires a

1017.39 --> 1021.86
huge amount of focus this is also what I

1019.37 --> 1024.17
explained to people is that look if my

1021.86 --> 1026.99
financial situation eventually gets too

1024.17 --> 1028.94
dire I will just simply be forced to

1026.99 --> 1031.94
step away and when that happens it's

1028.94 --> 1034.76
gonna be very hard to get back because I

1031.94 --> 1036.92
agree and and that's why I don't want to

1034.76 --> 1042.02
that's why that's really the bottom line

1036.92 --> 1043.459
reason why I am biting my pride my

1042.02 --> 1046.04
tongue and my pride at it and just

1043.459 --> 1047.959
asking for money because I want to keep

1046.04 --> 1052.73
on doing this and I don't see any other

1047.959 --> 1055.97
way that I can so that's why I do this

1052.73 --> 1057.59
and doesn't mean that's the end of it

1055.97 --> 1061.21
because I'm just still trying to figure

1057.59 --> 1065.8999999999999
out other options as I'm going as I live

1061.21 --> 1068.89
but yeah if I didn't get any kind of

1065.9 --> 1075.2
support I would have a very tough time

1068.89 --> 1081.1100000000001
keeping up a Daily Show so yeah if

1075.2 --> 1085.64
anybody in chat wants to oblige s X if

1081.11 --> 1087.83
you want to help me with my show I have

1085.64 --> 1089.69
no objections to that just go to the

1087.83 --> 1090.1699999999998
description box below there's a PayPal

1089.69 --> 1094.46
link

1090.17 --> 1096.98
a GoFundMe link still or the patreon any

1094.46 --> 1098.8700000000001
support to that would be just great I

1096.98 --> 1106.54
will shout you out and I will thank you

1098.87 --> 1106.54
for it and the show will go on so

1106.56 --> 1112.51
yeah I want a shout-out as well if you

1111.1 --> 1114.1899999999998
don't support the channels that make the

1112.51 --> 1116.86
content then the channels that make the

1114.19 --> 1120.0700000000002
content lose interest and leave that's

1116.86 --> 1121.4499999999998
literally it is it so support the

1120.07 --> 1124.06
channels that make the content and they

1121.45 --> 1126.52
stake a lose interest it's not even

1124.06 --> 1130.78
about interest it's you lose the grip

1126.52 --> 1134.8799999999999
you know it takes energy and money and

1130.78 --> 1137.53
time to to keep all of it going

1134.88 --> 1139.66
especially on a trailer basis and it's

1137.53 --> 1141.67
not because of the interest no it's

1139.66 --> 1145.3300000000002
because it just can't wield it anymore

1141.67 --> 1147.1000000000001
you know yeah I agree you're gonna be

1145.33 --> 1150.01
stressed out about something else or

1147.1 --> 1151.4199999999998
constantly having to go somewhere else I

1150.01 --> 1154.53
didn't expect the times and all that

1151.42 --> 1154.53
yeah it's just gonna be ruined

1156.99 --> 1161.56
have you heard anything of Randy by the

1159.67 --> 1165.46
way I haven't seen anything from him in

1161.56 --> 1166.99
a while I have actually yeah and I'm not

1165.46 --> 1168.55
sure what I shouldn't say but what I

1166.99 --> 1170.86
will say is that he's got his internet

1168.55 --> 1172.75
sorted and he's currently doing all that

1170.86 --> 1174.25
I work on him some work I'm not quite

1172.75 --> 1175.66
sure what the work is he didn't go into

1174.25 --> 1177.82
details other than that he's really busy

1175.66 --> 1179.8600000000001
and what he's done is he's basically

1177.82 --> 1181.87
because his internet mistake that he

1179.86 --> 1182.74
made meant that he was forced into

1181.87 --> 1184.57
having time off

1182.74 --> 1188.86
he said that basically spent that time

1184.57 --> 1190.4199999999998
working and he's realized that the

1188.86 --> 1192.9699999999998
internet was taking far too much time

1190.42 --> 1195.04
off his head off his hands and basically

1192.97 --> 1197.17
he needs to work and we spent too much

1195.04 --> 1198.82
time not working and it's cost him

1197.17 --> 1201.01
financially and he needs to have more

1198.82 --> 1202.11
money coming in and hack it's kind of

1201.01 --> 1204.91
like what you were just saying about

1202.11 --> 1207.28
like go for meas and whatever donations

1204.91 --> 1208.96
at the end of the day you have to make

1207.28 --> 1211.09
ends meet right you have to get enough

1208.96 --> 1212.1100000000001
money to survive and he wasn't making

1211.09 --> 1213.76
enough because he was spending too much

1212.11 --> 1215.1399999999999
time on the Internet and now he's gone

1213.76 --> 1216.91
back to work properly cuz he had two

1215.14 --> 1219.46
weeks off or whatever it was and he

1216.91 --> 1220.8400000000001
realizes that everything is can't

1219.46 --> 1223.02
revolve around the internet unless you

1220.84 --> 1226.9599999999998
make a full-time living off it yeah so

1223.02 --> 1229.18
yeah and hey his work is pretty decent

1226.96 --> 1231.3400000000001
paying so it's a good option for him

1229.18 --> 1233.38
it's not like he has to sacrifice a lot

1231.34 --> 1235.8999999999999
to go there again it's just his business

1233.38 --> 1238.63
and all that so yeah I don't blame him

1235.9 --> 1239.5900000000001
at all for doing that it's very logical

1238.63 --> 1242.1390000000001
I will

1239.59 --> 1245.649
probably do that if I had an option as

1242.139 --> 1248.35
viable as he does he built on it of

1245.649 --> 1254.62
course it's his life yeah he works for

1248.35 --> 1256.7489999999998
it yeah it's just a stark that all the

1254.62 --> 1258.309
all the bola is all criticized to fly

1256.749 --> 1261.22
earth is for making any money out of

1258.309 --> 1262.72
this yet they're all monetized and they

1261.22 --> 1264.759
don't criticize them I mean let's not

1262.72 --> 1266.3700000000001
forget greatest sapien stole 20,000

1264.759 --> 1269.59
pound with a go for me from people

1266.37 --> 1271.7489999999998
$20,000 for an Arctic trip that we knew

1269.59 --> 1274.119
would never ever happen that's a bit of

1271.749 --> 1277.749
a problem isn't it because we know well

1274.119 --> 1280.4189999999999
we know that you ballers take money out

1277.749 --> 1282.58
left right and center and we don't take

1280.419 --> 1285.8790000000001
money or the little bits of scrapes that

1282.58 --> 1287.649
we do is needed in most cases and that's

1285.879 --> 1288.9399999999998
the reason why office Lee that's the

1287.649 --> 1290.559
reason why I don't spend too much time

1288.94 --> 1292.8690000000001
in it I do come on to Nathan's

1290.559 --> 1294.1589999999999
periodically but I don't spend too much

1292.869 --> 1295.629
time in it because there's no money in

1294.159 --> 1297.8790000000001
it it's not actually worth my time to

1295.629 --> 1299.4399999999998
spend money on YouTube I'd rather spend

1297.879 --> 1302.129
it in other ways which is the reason why

1299.44 --> 1302.1290000000001
I do what I'm doing

1302.999 --> 1316.769
so I was going nuts no I've got Jose

1312.07 --> 1316.769
blocked all right I don't know why but

1317.159 --> 1321.279
it's just everything Thompson says

1320.049 --> 1322.929
that's a really large claim towards

1321.279 --> 1325.629
sapien Bill Thompson let me be really

1322.929 --> 1327.6390000000001
clear greater sapien claimed $20,000

1325.629 --> 1329.649
offer go for me for a flight that no but

1327.639 --> 1331.9599999999998
everybody knew would work would not work

1329.649 --> 1333.399
nobody thought that it would happen on

1331.96 --> 1334.509
our side because you can't fly over the

1333.399 --> 1337.5089999999998
South Pole and come back up the other

1334.509 --> 1339.249
side and and what do you know that trip

1337.509 --> 1341.23
didn't happen but he still kept the

1339.249 --> 1343.659
money didn't he he still kept the 20,000

1341.23 --> 1346.57
so and then you criticize people like

1343.659 --> 1347.95
Arwen or run tea on me and I have one

1346.57 --> 1349.84
line in my description box

1347.95 --> 1351.519
that's not begging for money it's just

1349.84 --> 1353.529
saying if you want to support me you can

1351.519 --> 1355.84
I never mention it but for when Lottie

1353.529 --> 1357.909
starts kicking off about it that's not

1355.84 --> 1360.1589999999999
begging for money but greater Sapien

1357.909 --> 1362.3500000000001
takes $20,000 off people and that's just

1360.159 --> 1364.8990000000001
ignored

1362.35 --> 1369.4599999999998
Anthony I kind of think that's a bit of

1364.899 --> 1373.5
a false comparison faucet because look

1369.46 --> 1376.18
begging for money is not

1373.5 --> 1378.49
literally it's just it's a voluntary

1376.18 --> 1380.44
basis like hey if you help me out you

1378.49 --> 1382.96
can figure out what the consequences

1380.44 --> 1386.44
will be it'll be a good act will be a

1382.96 --> 1388.69
receive good and whatever I do might be

1386.44 --> 1390.79
worth it or not to the individual giving

1388.69 --> 1394.63
it right that's how it works it's just

1390.79 --> 1398.71
the honest thing but if he actually said

1394.63 --> 1400.72
look I'm gonna go do this then get a lot

1398.71 --> 1401.98
of money for it and that do not do any

1400.72 --> 1405.88
that's not begging for money

1401.98 --> 1411.07
that's scamming it's a big difference

1405.88 --> 1414.91
now there is a sin it's a sinful act to

1411.07 --> 1417.79
do that and I had and things can go

1414.91 --> 1420.49
wrong you know plans can alter and a for

1417.79 --> 1423.19
me in the example was a bit yeah freak

1420.49 --> 1425.5
out with the globe light tour I said

1423.19 --> 1426.6100000000001
like oh yeah I might go there I might do

1425.5 --> 1428.95
it if I got the money then I

1426.61 --> 1431.83
unexpectedly got shaft a lot of money in

1428.95 --> 1433.8400000000001
my face and then I backed out because I

1431.83 --> 1436.24
thought I couldn't handle it and hey I

1433.84 --> 1439.24
said look anyone that wants that money

1436.24 --> 1441.19
back I will give it and I ran Armstrong

1439.24 --> 1444.67
asked for his money back I gave it to

1441.19 --> 1446.38
him and other people I tried to ask them

1444.67 --> 1449.38
individually and they said it was all

1446.38 --> 1451.63
fine I said I talked about it in general

1449.38 --> 1454.3000000000002
said okay I'm gonna buy the tripod with

1451.63 --> 1456.3100000000002
it and then the rest of it will cover

1454.3 --> 1459.73
just the expenses for the Amsterdam

1456.31 --> 1464.29
conference side costs and travel costs

1459.73 --> 1466.51
and if that's okay with everyone I'll

1464.29 --> 1469.57
keep the rest and I haven't had any

1466.51 --> 1471.64
direct complaints from the donators so I

1469.57 --> 1472.96
resolved that it's not a scam because I

1471.64 --> 1475.66
fixed it I

1472.96 --> 1476.95
I gave anyone that wanted their money

1475.66 --> 1479.44
back their money back

1476.95 --> 1484.3
I don't think that the greater Sapien

1479.44 --> 1487.74
right did the same obliged to the same

1484.3 --> 1493.71
level correct there's still people

1487.74 --> 1497.6200000000001
wanting their money back right now Tony

1493.71 --> 1498.8500000000001
on great sapiens yes I don't know I

1497.62 --> 1500.1399999999999
think it's good didn't that long ago

1498.85 --> 1502.4199999999998
it's been that long now I think great

1500.14 --> 1504.49
sapiens kind of weather the storm long

1502.42 --> 1505.39
enough that he's just allowed to keep it

1504.49 --> 1509.11
because

1505.39 --> 1510.7
I don't know 9 nobody seemed to be

1509.11 --> 1514.29
bothered about gifting name what 20

1510.7 --> 1514.29
grand but if we imagine if it was us

1515.52 --> 1520.3899999999999
bill Thompson says that it's not what's

1518.5 --> 1521.86
he saying here bill Thompson in other

1520.39 --> 1523.63
words he did the scam anybody know it

1521.86 --> 1525.49
was a scam sapien did not return the

1523.63 --> 1527.5590000000002
money it's dishonest and then he says

1525.49 --> 1528.82
not if he asks people if they want it

1527.559 --> 1529.36
back yeah but he still took it in the

1528.82 --> 1531.28
first place

1529.36 --> 1533.4399999999998
offering to return the money isn't the

1531.28 --> 1535.48
bit that's the scam and that's the

1533.44 --> 1536.679
restitution isn't it it's important

1535.48 --> 1538.6
important things back to the way they

1536.679 --> 1540.669
were but the offense is there in the

1538.6 --> 1542.8899999999999
first place no you can't fly over the

1540.669 --> 1548.14
southern pole you can't do it you're not

1542.89 --> 1550.419
helping my case sorry I'm just giving

1548.14 --> 1553.63
I'm just feeling water in the trolls all

1550.419 --> 1556.2700000000002
right look the claim was kind of written

1553.63 --> 1558.429
preposterous though they claim that our

1556.27 --> 1560.559
win would be going on the global I tour

1558.429 --> 1562.8700000000001
is not that preposterous like it could

1560.559 --> 1566.74
be a physical possibility if I had the

1562.87 --> 1569.799
stamina the the form to do it it's a

1566.74 --> 1573.549
human task it's not seemingly impossible

1569.799 --> 1575.9189999999999
it's not the act itself that was going

1573.549 --> 1578.9189999999999
to be fun that was not preposterous or

1575.919 --> 1584.23
contests of all whether that be real or

1578.919 --> 1587.3500000000001
not right that's the difference yeah I

1584.23 --> 1589.96
didn't put a bet on it almost like that

1587.35 --> 1590.8899999999999
it wasn't actually really any flatter

1589.96 --> 1593.919
through anything

1590.89 --> 1599.0400000000002
science Flat Earth proof related it was

1593.919 --> 1599.0400000000002
just activism so anyway

1603.4 --> 1608.66
anyone be distracted by these yeah

1606.71 --> 1611.72
they're the trolls really like my chat

1608.66 --> 1613.5500000000002
these days oh yeah they like anything

1611.72 --> 1617.39
anybody on our side that makes any kind

1613.55 --> 1618.8899999999999
of like material at all they just they

1617.39 --> 1620.6000000000001
target them don't they I mean that the

1618.89 --> 1622.5500000000002
simple fact is Bill Thompson whether you

1620.6 --> 1623.87
think they whatever you think about it

1622.55 --> 1625.31
the bottom line is you can't fly over

1623.87 --> 1627.02
the South Pole you can't come back up

1625.31 --> 1628.73
the other side we told everybody that

1627.02 --> 1630.77
you couldn't do it and what do you know

1628.73 --> 1632.45
it didn't happen if the earth really was

1630.77 --> 1634.49
a sphere this would be able to happen

1632.45 --> 1636.23
right and it can't happen it's not down

1634.49 --> 1637.91
to Flat Earth is to do it it's down to

1636.23 --> 1639.53
the Borla this is to demonstrate it and

1637.91 --> 1641.63
I'm glad that it was ball earth as it

1639.53 --> 1642.95
donated to the cause because it wasn't

1641.63 --> 1644.8400000000001
flat earthers that lost the money it was

1642.95 --> 1646.04
baller this-- but it doesn't change the

1644.84 --> 1648.53
fact that you guys can't demonstrate

1646.04 --> 1650.6299999999999
that you can't prove that you can fly

1648.53 --> 1652.22
from South America over the pole back up

1650.63 --> 1654.5900000000001
to the other side and do it in the time

1652.22 --> 1656.27
limit that's required in the to achieve

1654.59 --> 1659.4499999999998
and prove the route that he took as well

1656.27 --> 1661.16
you can't do it so that about sapient

1659.45 --> 1662.24
failure is like George Aires fail if

1661.16 --> 1664.19
Aris failure

1662.24 --> 1665.66
it's the sapien failure he failed to

1664.19 --> 1667.55
prove that you could fly over the the

1665.66 --> 1669.26
North or the South Pole that's all right

1667.55 --> 1670.85
he got 20 grand out of it but he still

1669.26 --> 1673.42
failed to prove that you could fly over

1670.85 --> 1673.4199999999998
the South Pole

1678.95 --> 1683.3700000000001
there certainly seems to be this issue

1681.45 --> 1688.8
about the South Pole isn't it doesn't

1683.37 --> 1691.02
there it's it to me it's still it's

1688.8 --> 1692.34
widely contestable what the South Pole

1691.02 --> 1694.62
really is whether it's a disc

1692.34 --> 1699.6599999999999
surrounding us whether it is the south

1694.62 --> 1703.02
side a flat scape or as the ball of

1699.66 --> 1705.21
demands is an island and I think it's

1703.02 --> 1707.84
that island just isn't there the way

1705.21 --> 1711.93
they say you know even if for example

1707.84 --> 1713.82
now I'm gonna go loopy again if the

1711.93 --> 1716.25
earth realm the looping realm was

1713.82 --> 1719.1
narrower at the poles than at the

1716.25 --> 1721.65
equator like that the issue would be

1719.1 --> 1723.99
that it would that the South Pole would

1721.65 --> 1725.73
seemingly be an island until you moved

1723.99 --> 1728.19
further south and then certainly it

1725.73 --> 1731.25
would open up to a watch much wider

1728.19 --> 1734.76
scape and maybe that is the thing that

1731.25 --> 1738.98
they're trying to conceal or just that

1734.76 --> 1741.96
it's not even remotely Island alike

1738.98 --> 1744.45
anything that that is what I'm betting

1741.96 --> 1747.41
on with why they're trying to conceal it

1744.45 --> 1747.41
the way they do

1751.32 --> 1755.28
do you think that there's more land

1753.27 --> 1758.37
beyond the South Pole beyond that I

1755.28 --> 1761.19
swore I don't know we can speculate all

1758.37 --> 1761.82
day I think that I don't know I don't

1761.19 --> 1763.68
know what to think

1761.82 --> 1766.26
there's no evidence that says that it

1763.68 --> 1767.64
may be or may not be other than logic

1766.26 --> 1771.92
and reason that indicates that it might

1767.64 --> 1774.48
be how about Admiral Byrd's testimony I

1771.92 --> 1775.8600000000001
think where the testimonies interested I

1774.48 --> 1777.69
think that it would need to be verified

1775.86 --> 1779.1
by repeating it but we can't repeat it

1777.69 --> 1782.8700000000001
because it's off-limits you can't get

1779.1 --> 1786.6599999999999
there but right I understand but he was

1782.87 --> 1790.7299999999998
very specific about his wording it was

1786.66 --> 1793.92
like beyond there's more beyond that

1790.73 --> 1797.1
it's not just like oh the South Pole is

1793.92 --> 1800.0700000000002
just bigger no there's other land there

1797.1 --> 1804.78
and minerals and all that stuff this is

1800.07 --> 1806.6399999999999
like very Pontifical II stated didn't

1804.78 --> 1809.82
you also say that you and be on the 80th

1806.64 --> 1811.92
parallel there is some element some kind

1809.82 --> 1814.02
of dome or something that was taking

1811.92 --> 1815.5500000000002
planes out of the sky about 30,000 feets

1814.02 --> 1817.17
the planes were literally being pulled

1815.55 --> 1818.76
out the sky and disintegrated and they

1817.17 --> 1819.45
thought it was German technology have

1818.76 --> 1825.36
you seen that

1819.45 --> 1827.88
that's no Wow it was it I saw it on one

1825.36 --> 1831.27
of the feeds and it could be all kinds

1827.88 --> 1832.38
of things that could yeah it was on one

1831.27 --> 1833.8799999999999
of the feeds on I think it was on

1832.38 --> 1835.8000000000002
Facebook I'm not sure where it was a

1833.88 --> 1837.5100000000002
four-member I can't remember where sorry

1835.8 --> 1839.04
I'll have to try and find it it was

1837.51 --> 1842.25
basically a citation out of an

1839.04 --> 1844.11
encyclopedia dated something like 1967

1842.25 --> 1846.6
or something like that and I'm it

1844.11 --> 1849.3
itemized that planes that were flying at

1846.6 --> 1851.49
the 80th parallel around 30,000 feet

1849.3 --> 1853.05
were being taken out the skies if they

1851.49 --> 1856.23
were being wiped out by some kind of

1853.05 --> 1857.73
like war weaponry or whatever and they

1856.23 --> 1859.65
thought it was German technology at the

1857.73 --> 1861.42
time and it turns out that what they

1859.65 --> 1864.27
were describing is what seems to be the

1861.42 --> 1867.29
outer edge and wall though whatever you

1864.27 --> 1869.55
want to call or a disruptive field

1867.29 --> 1871.83
something there seems to be something

1869.55 --> 1873.84
there and it's worthy of investigation

1871.83 --> 1876.83
because it's funny that that you

1873.84 --> 1879.75
mentioned or that he mentioned potential

1876.83 --> 1881.8799999999999
German technology energy shield or

1879.75 --> 1884.67
whatever because ever considered that

1881.88 --> 1888.42
that might have actually been the thing

1884.67 --> 1889.92
that it was that it didn't really relate

1888.42 --> 1897.63
to Adam that it was just something

1889.92 --> 1899.94
erected to cut off a region yeah could

1897.63 --> 1903.5400000000002
be who knows exactly it's fascinating

1899.94 --> 1908.0700000000002
like especially the specific yeah the

1903.54 --> 1911.58
specificness about the that that

1908.07 --> 1916.6499999999999
position supposedly that it that could

1911.58 --> 1920.3899999999999
be repeatable just have to see that we

1916.65 --> 1922.71
can actually try to test it in the open

1920.39 --> 1925.0490000000002
wonderfully I wondering if it's gonna be

1922.71 --> 1926.28
allowed of course but yeah all you need

1925.049 --> 1928.41
is a weather bloom wouldn't you can get

1926.28 --> 1929.73
to 30,000 feet if you get to space of

1928.41 --> 1931.5900000000001
the yeah if you look at where the 80th

1929.73 --> 1933.48
parallel is is it's quite quite deep

1931.59 --> 1936.0
into the Antarctic region that they tell

1933.48 --> 1937.98
us is the continent of Antarctica it's

1936.0 --> 1939.51
quite deep into it and but nonetheless

1937.98 --> 1941.549
you couldn't Theory get there with a

1939.51 --> 1945.78
weather balloon and I'm sure master

1941.549 --> 1949.1689999999999
after could you point edit on a on a map

1945.78 --> 1952.74
on Google Maps for example exactly where

1949.169 --> 1955.26
that would be be good to see yeah just

1952.74 --> 1956.97
go to Google Earth and then scroll down

1955.26 --> 1961.23
to the 80th parallel and you'll see that

1956.97 --> 1968.059
takes you just decide let me try out

1961.23 --> 1968.059
Google Maps and then get the satellite

1976.549 --> 1982.25
okay how do I do this

1988.06 --> 1994.69
okay I don't know exactly how can show

1991.16 --> 1996.8600000000001
it I can show you on skype anyway I

1994.69 --> 1998.48
could do a screen share and demonstrate

1996.86 --> 2006.85
see if you want oh that would be great

1998.48 --> 2010.35
yes yes okay if you could um screen

2006.85 --> 2010.35
share are you ready yeah

2012.57 --> 2018.52
can you see yes

2014.83 --> 2020.3799999999999
yes I can okay so beyond the 80th

2018.52 --> 2022.9
parallel if you just scroll it around to

2020.38 --> 2025.9
the 80th parallel and you'll see that

2022.9 --> 2028.99
obviously the 90th parallel will be that

2025.9 --> 2030.88
the pole itself and that it's sighted I

2028.99 --> 2032.86
think it said I think it was the 85th

2030.88 --> 2035.71
parallel the 85th degrees I think it

2032.86 --> 2038.7099999999998
said it was either 80 or 80 85

2035.71 --> 2042.6100000000001
yeah it was 85 if you get to the 85th

2038.71 --> 2044.1100000000001
parallel and at 30,000 feet the the

2042.61 --> 2045.76
planes are coming up being literally

2044.11 --> 2048.13
just disintegrating in the sky as if

2045.76 --> 2049.75
they smash it into somewhat and I can do

2048.13 --> 2051.9100000000003
it the citation so I could show you it

2049.75 --> 2053.53
rather than just cite it because I'll

2051.91 --> 2056.02
probably get it wrong and I'm just

2053.53 --> 2057.28
scrolling down to see whether or not let

2056.02 --> 2063.27
me see

2057.28 --> 2066.46
might be in we just find it any other

2063.27 --> 2069.16
correlating weird light based phenomena

2066.46 --> 2071.95
for example at that parallel like if

2069.16 --> 2074.89
there was some kind of presumed barrier

2071.95 --> 2078.0099999999998
relating to the reflections and all that

2074.89 --> 2079.75
off light then there should if there's

2078.01 --> 2082.3300000000004
something to bump into its depth there

2079.75 --> 2087.04
should be visual aberrations with light

2082.33 --> 2090.91
as well yeah check this out so this is

2087.04 --> 2093.82
Sara Cristina's 5 UK 5 rebels UK and

2090.91 --> 2096.2799999999997
further ones right don't need sound so

2093.82 --> 2098.92
this is the this is the encyclopedia of

2096.28 --> 2101.26
America encyclopedia Americana

2098.92 --> 2103.9300000000003
and it's dated there's the date on it

2101.26 --> 2107.5200000000004
somewhere and what she's showing in this

2103.93 --> 2107.52
is when she opens up to a certain page

2108.0 --> 2111.22
I'll just talk about this because I

2109.99 --> 2112.33
don't want the sound to go through I

2111.22 --> 2115.31
don't know what I'll finish we play

2112.33 --> 2119.08
volume 2 of encyclopedia Americana

2115.31 --> 2122.6
and then she turns to a particular page

2119.08 --> 2126.14
issued 1958 right so bear in mind what

2122.6 --> 2127.8199999999997
happened around 1958 cool this and then

2126.14 --> 2130.31
she goes to a particular region in the

2127.82 --> 2132.59
book and it talks about Antarctica and

2130.31 --> 2134.87
it talks about Admiral I think it's

2132.59 --> 2137.8700000000003
Admiral Byrd's thing and I'll read from

2134.87 --> 2139.27
it so that you guys in chat can see it

2137.87 --> 2143.5099999999998
[Music]

2139.27 --> 2145.7599999999998
come on here we go she's just getting

2143.51 --> 2153.0200000000004
the camera focused right she reads and

2145.76 --> 2155.51
she says we were going on Ross Island in

2153.02 --> 2158.36
McMurdo Sound for United States planes

2155.51 --> 2162.34
flew from New Zealand to McMurdo Sound

2158.36 --> 2164.78
on December 20th 1955 and made

2162.34 --> 2167.6200000000003
exploratory flights over unknown parts

2164.78 --> 2171.4100000000003
of the continent until January the 18th

2167.62 --> 2174.17
1958 that 56 when they returned to New

2171.41 --> 2176.5699999999997
Zealand these flights proved the inland

2174.17 --> 2179.9300000000003
areas to be featureless in character

2176.57 --> 2183.2000000000003
with a dome 13,000 feet high at about

2179.93 --> 2186.6699999999996
latitude 80 degrees south so this this

2183.2 --> 2190.52
flight Wow

2186.67 --> 2193.4900000000002
you've not seen this no okay so these

2190.52 --> 2195.95
flights proved the inland areas of the

2193.49 --> 2197.99
whatever the the whatever the southern

2195.95 --> 2199.73
continent or whatever to be featureless

2197.99 --> 2203.12
in character which we can understand and

2199.73 --> 2205.52
accept with a dome 13,000 feet high at

2203.12 --> 2207.74
about latitude 80 degrees south latitude

2205.52 --> 2211.82
eight ninety degrees east

2207.74 --> 2214.1899999999996
but that doesn't imply well the dome as

2211.82 --> 2226.67
in what they're actually describing

2214.19 --> 2231.65
because could it be or it doesn't matter

2226.67 --> 2232.82
it's not well it matters in the sense it

2231.65 --> 2234.17
doesn't matter in the sense that it's

2232.82 --> 2237.2000000000003
not part of their model that there's a

2234.17 --> 2239.96
dome there right well maybe their dome

2237.2 --> 2242.48
is a man-made phenomena see no it

2239.96 --> 2245.39
matters a lot what the approach of the

2242.48 --> 2248.9
dome is is it like inside of the dome to

2245.39 --> 2251.7799999999997
the side or are they bumping into this

2248.9 --> 2252.35
a dove a separate dope well yeah let's

2251.78 --> 2254.75
keep playing

2252.35 --> 2256.37
please okay so let's just address

2254.75 --> 2258.86
somebody in chattier that's basically

2256.37 --> 2261.29
taking the piss EW he says magic says

2258.86 --> 2262.6400000000003
domes at 13,000 feet well let's just

2261.29 --> 2264.98
carry on reading and see what it says

2262.64 --> 2266.33
because this describes these planes it

2264.98 --> 2270.47
should literally be pulled out the skies

2266.33 --> 2273.56
it says new mountain ranges new mountain

2270.47 --> 2275.77
ranges were thirty thousand mountain

2273.56 --> 2281.6
ranges were located at about latitude

2275.77 --> 2287.06
some 85 degrees south longitude 93

2281.6 --> 2289.91
fingers 50 degrees west I hope and I

2287.06 --> 2292.1
think she moves to another parlor and

2289.91 --> 2294.1099999999997
although that's referencing just the dog

2292.1 --> 2295.73
there's a part of this where maybe it's

2294.11 --> 2296.96
a different clip what she references

2295.73 --> 2298.97
these planes that were pulled out of the

2296.96 --> 2301.4900000000002
sky and they thought it was German

2298.97 --> 2303.77
technology that they did you know they'd

2301.49 --> 2305.4799999999996
mastered and got online and it wasn't

2303.77 --> 2308.27
German technology although this is what

2305.48 --> 2313.34
they think it is now 13,000 feet high a

2308.27 --> 2319.46
lot about latitude 80 degrees south oh

2313.34 --> 2322.01
yeah but it's not clear exactly how they

2319.46 --> 2324.14
approached and concluded a dome it's

2322.01 --> 2326.2700000000004
just mentioned a dome there's a dome

2324.14 --> 2329.39
there what is the nature of the dome

2326.27 --> 2331.52
what is the orientation did they bump

2329.39 --> 2336.23
into the side of a dome or that they

2331.52 --> 2339.47
bump into the inside of the brain no

2336.23 --> 2341.27
clarity well there was there was so much

2339.47 --> 2344.39
to do with the planes that were crashing

2341.27 --> 2347.45
into something out there yeah I get that

2344.39 --> 2354.77
part so were they crashing on the inside

2347.45 --> 2356.75
of the dome or straight into a wall well

2354.77 --> 2359.09
what the scene is 8 degrees south and

2356.75 --> 2360.44
latitude at 13,000 feet that's the edge

2359.09 --> 2363.32
of the dome that the planes are crashing

2360.44 --> 2365.12
into I mean I'm not at the end of the

2363.32 --> 2367.13
day the citation is from the

2365.12 --> 2368.63
Encyclopedia Americana right this is not

2367.13 --> 2370.67
made up Flat Earth [ __ ] rhetoric

2368.63 --> 2372.65
this is real world and if you were to

2370.67 --> 2373.85
find this you'd be able to get it I

2372.65 --> 2375.98
don't know where this exists from but

2373.85 --> 2378.71
I'm sure you could get this right so

2375.98 --> 2381.05
that's what it's just oh yeah before it

2378.71 --> 2382.52
doesn't matter that it's old has it been

2381.05 --> 2383.9300000000003
that's the question has it been

2382.52 --> 2386.08
suppressed well it's not gonna be

2383.93 --> 2390.14
printed in print anymore

2386.08 --> 2392.5099999999998
correct so these examples these types of

2390.14 --> 2395.81
answer encyclopedia are just rare

2392.51 --> 2399.98
exactly because of this old encyclopedia

2395.81 --> 2402.32
are potentially very valuable because of

2399.98 --> 2405.68
the censorship that has preceded them

2402.32 --> 2409.6400000000003
and changed everything around so they

2405.68 --> 2411.62
yield love yeah stuff that's kind of no

2409.64 --> 2413.69
longer really permitted and has been

2411.62 --> 2416.5099999999998
taken out but in the old days it's still

2413.69 --> 2417.9500000000003
there well I can sit and when you see

2416.51 --> 2421.4500000000003
stuff like that in an old book you can

2417.95 --> 2421.45
understand why they might burn books

2424.27 --> 2427.13
yeah

2425.54 --> 2428.33
people and kill people if they've got

2427.13 --> 2429.7400000000002
evidence that doesn't support the

2428.33 --> 2433.22
official narrative you can't question

2429.74 --> 2438.74
the official narrative at certain key

2433.22 --> 2440.2099999999996
moments perhaps warrant evidence says if

2438.74 --> 2441.6499999999996
we're under a dome why can't we see the

2440.21 --> 2443.03
Northern Star the North Star in the

2441.65 --> 2444.77
southern hemisphere when the pole size

2443.03 --> 2447.2000000000003
at the top of the dome because you can't

2444.77 --> 2448.58
see far enough you can't see forever you

2447.2 --> 2450.0499999999997
don't have bionic eyes there's an

2448.58 --> 2451.7599999999998
atmosphere in the way you're looking

2450.05 --> 2453.3500000000004
through a density gradient you're

2451.76 --> 2454.82
looking through moisture I mean there's

2453.35 --> 2456.98
loads of reasons you can't see forever

2454.82 --> 2457.8500000000004
under it under the sea and the ocean or

2456.98 --> 2460.55
a matter

2457.85 --> 2463.31
there is no geometrical direct relation

2460.55 --> 2465.8300000000004
because there's no specific physical

2463.31 --> 2468.0499999999997
positions of any of the celestial bodies

2465.83 --> 2471.11
there's just angular positions in

2468.05 --> 2475.82
relation to the observer with a very

2471.11 --> 2477.83
specific model that's what Bill Thompson

2475.82 --> 2479.54
says if he should just go find the dome

2477.83 --> 2481.64
at this point how can I feel I'll find

2479.54 --> 2485.6
the dome when we have a compass and a

2481.64 --> 2488.66
p900 we have no planes we have no money

2485.6 --> 2492.62
no people no resources and what's all

2488.66 --> 2495.95
that we're crazy before we even get to

2492.62 --> 2498.65
the dome or whatever there's still a lot

2495.95 --> 2501.3799999999997
to figure out before that what is the

2498.65 --> 2504.32
orientation of the land and sea bottom

2501.38 --> 2508.1600000000003
in relation to one another what is the

2504.32 --> 2511.31
actual spatial layout of what we know to

2508.16 --> 2514.16
be there what is it why don't we figure

2511.31 --> 2516.77
out that with absolute certainty for

2514.16 --> 2524.27
and stop trying to presuppose things and

2516.77 --> 2526.0099999999998
just get the real thing somehow more and

2524.27 --> 2527.63
evidences yet we can see the Sun and the

2526.01 --> 2528.8900000000003
moon that's thousands of miles away

2527.63 --> 2530.21
yeah but they are pretty big aren't ly

2528.89 --> 2530.8689999999997
you can tell by looking at them the

2530.21 --> 2533.27
pretty big

2530.869 --> 2534.5
you can't tell our Father but the big

2533.27 --> 2536.75
enough for you to be able to pick out

2534.5 --> 2538.31
resolution with your own eye and we know

2536.75 --> 2542.51
that that's quite difficult to do with

2538.31 --> 2550.72
the 93 million miles away right or 280

2542.51 --> 2553.9100000000003
thousand miles there's no distance

2550.72 --> 2556.45
because they don't line up they there is

2553.91 --> 2560.21
no line up of the celestial bodies

2556.45 --> 2563.6299999999997
perfectly that would suggest any kind of

2560.21 --> 2568.339
literal geometrical position it's all

2563.63 --> 2572.329
just angular relations and they can seem

2568.339 --> 2574.94
to be at specific positions but it will

2572.329 --> 2577.4900000000002
always be seemingly because if you

2574.94 --> 2580.76
really test it out it's not gonna work

2577.49 --> 2582.5299999999997
out and hey again approachability why

2580.76 --> 2584.75
don't you approach it it's gonna bend

2582.53 --> 2587.5690000000004
away revealing that it is not actually

2584.75 --> 2593.18
in that location yeah there's always an

2587.569 --> 2595.16
erroneous couple of was the word data

2593.18 --> 2598.06
collection points when you try and try

2595.16 --> 2601.609
and collect the Sun on the ball model

2598.06 --> 2605.39
model as well issues as well happy you

2601.609 --> 2608.06
should all be identical on the Flat

2605.39 --> 2611.1189999999997
Earth model the disk model based model

2608.06 --> 2612.77
with the presuppositions of heavenly

2611.119 --> 2615.56
bodies being in sort of physical

2612.77 --> 2619.13
positions closer by the same issues also

2615.56 --> 2621.2
persistent that's and though all of

2619.13 --> 2623.06
these things just to me reveal look the

2621.2 --> 2626.589
heavenly bodies are not in a physical

2623.06 --> 2631.13
literal position they're all lights and

2626.589 --> 2636.29
you can't really triangulate them it's

2631.13 --> 2638.1800000000003
not effective it doesn't work out so

2636.29 --> 2640.43
morons they're trolling in chat he's

2638.18 --> 2642.109
like what's he saying so but you said

2640.43 --> 2643.64
you can't see at a distance which is it

2642.109 --> 2645.319
yeah if you're looking laterally out to

2643.64 --> 2646.8489999999997
the horizon you're looking through

2645.319 --> 2647.69
liquid you're looking through fluid

2646.849 --> 2650.119
right

2647.69 --> 2651.98
the atmosphere is fluid it behaves like

2650.119 --> 2653.7200000000003
in accordance with fluid dynamics

2651.98 --> 2655.309
so it's essentially as I like trying to

2653.72 --> 2657.0789999999997
look the far under the swimming pool

2655.309 --> 2659.48
it becomes murky the further away you

2657.079 --> 2661.2200000000003
get that's still on a small scale it's

2659.48 --> 2662.93
the same with the real world you're just

2661.22 --> 2665.27
looking over what's fair the distance

2662.93 --> 2667.73
but it doesn't change the fact that the

2665.27 --> 2669.319
atmosphere is a fluid you can't see

2667.73 --> 2672.2
forever you don't have bionic eyes you

2669.319 --> 2673.52
can't you can't see indefinitely and

2672.2 --> 2675.2
perspective stopped you from Zenon

2673.52 --> 2677.15
definitely - and the angular size

2675.2 --> 2679.0989999999997
resolution limitation and Raley's

2677.15 --> 2680.2400000000002
diffraction limits and a few other

2679.099 --> 2684.2000000000003
things that stop you from seeing light

2680.24 --> 2686.4199999999996
pollution and atmospheric obstructions

2684.2 --> 2688.8799999999997
what's that is that a figurine on your

2686.42 --> 2690.6800000000003
own oh oh right it's a bird on a chimney

2688.88 --> 2694.549
yeah it looks like it was a statue of

2690.68 --> 2701.39
some kind no it's George it's my special

2694.549 --> 2704.14
crow friend did you know that okay

2701.39 --> 2712.3689999999997
almost got him to eat out of my hand

2704.14 --> 2713.72
like Ravi says if the Sun goes round you

2712.369 --> 2716.3900000000003
in Antarctica would that tell you

2713.72 --> 2718.3689999999997
anything yeah it would tell you that

2716.39 --> 2723.049
you're probably on a ball but we know

2718.369 --> 2728.6600000000003
that you get nine months and the Sun go

2723.049 --> 2731.45
around you yeah wouldn't it just reveal

2728.66 --> 2734.1499999999996
a weird angular relation of the heavenly

2731.45 --> 2737.39
bodies in relation to that location on

2734.15 --> 2740.1800000000003
the earth wouldn't prove a ball at all

2737.39 --> 2743.66
again presuppositional mechanics don't

2740.18 --> 2746.75
don't go there right what is light and

2743.66 --> 2749.39
however it reveals its angular relations

2746.75 --> 2750.589
to our position that does not prove an

2749.39 --> 2755.0
earth geometry

2750.589 --> 2756.65
it never really will warren says but you

2755.0 --> 2758.349
are looking up to the top of the dome so

2756.65 --> 2760.94
the atmosphere is less as you go higher

2758.349 --> 2763.579
warren the only time that you're looking

2760.94 --> 2765.2000000000003
up at the top of the dome in the context

2763.579 --> 2768.529
of the North Star is when you're at the

2765.2 --> 2770.6899999999996
North Pole for every mile you go the

2768.529 --> 2772.7
North Star appears to drop by around

2770.69 --> 2774.349
about a degree it's not quite a degree

2772.7 --> 2776.569
it slows down as it gets towards the

2774.349 --> 2778.46
horizon police say that's perspective

2776.569 --> 2781.22
you say that's refraction and bending

2778.46 --> 2782.7200000000003
light whichever it is it slows down

2781.22 --> 2784.3999999999996
gets to the horizon it starts to

2782.72 --> 2785.48
converge with the horizon and then you

2784.4 --> 2787.369
can't see anymore

2785.48 --> 2789.14
that's consistent with perspective and

2787.369 --> 2790.55
proximity that's not consistent with

2789.14 --> 2792.44
your claim that you should be able to

2790.55 --> 2793.88
see the Roth's are from the southern

2792.44 --> 2796.13
hemisphere you shouldn't because it goes

2793.88 --> 2798.079
beyond the horizon not because it's a

2796.13 --> 2799.819
ball but because it gets too far from

2798.079 --> 2809.9300000000003
your proximity look up the word

2799.819 --> 2811.609
proximity proximity I love the word yeah

2809.93 --> 2813.14
it's a great word magic says I think he

2811.609 --> 2815.06
could be a bigger ball like Jupiter

2813.14 --> 2818.089
I've not real doubt it could be a bigger

2815.06 --> 2824.48
ball like Jupiter well it'd have to be a

2818.089 --> 2827.3289999999997
lot bigger though weird issues that's

2824.48 --> 2832.76
still not gonna make any kind of literal

2827.329 --> 2835.76
ball and fill up by space situation the

2832.76 --> 2838.19
thing is if it is a ball right of any

2835.76 --> 2840.4100000000003
size then it means that you have to

2838.19 --> 2842.839
offer the rotation of the North Star

2840.41 --> 2844.31
repeated in the south and that means

2842.839 --> 2846.0789999999997
that you have to have somebody in South

2844.31 --> 2847.849
America and somebody in Australia

2846.079 --> 2849.349
looking South at the same time seeing

2847.849 --> 2851.42
the same stars just in a different

2849.349 --> 2853.01
rotation now we don't have that evidence

2851.42 --> 2855.619
because we're told that declination

2853.01 --> 2858.2000000000003
changes things declination corrects what

2855.619 --> 2859.73
you perceive is south it's not actually

2858.2 --> 2861.98
south it's like 10 degrees either way

2859.73 --> 2863.66
and it's like well why does declination

2861.98 --> 2865.46
exist who shouldn't it be the case that

2863.66 --> 2866.72
we see the stars in the South rotating

2865.46 --> 2868.4
around the southern rotation point and

2866.72 --> 2869.93
the answer is we don't see that that

2868.4 --> 2871.52
evidence does not exist and if it did

2869.93 --> 2874.0099999999998
exist you would see that there there are

2871.52 --> 2875.69
10 degrees away from South and that when

2874.01 --> 2878.1800000000003
you look it up and like plot these

2875.69 --> 2880.88
things you think well that can't be like

2878.18 --> 2883.43
that on a sphere but ball has just

2880.88 --> 2884.869
ignore that and I might you can't just

2883.43 --> 2886.3999999999996
ignore about it's like you can't ignore

2884.869 --> 2888.56
gas pressure with our container

2886.4 --> 2890.599
you can't ignore that these are the the

2888.56 --> 2892.369
facts the science facts that demonstrate

2890.599 --> 2894.8
that we're not living on a sphere but

2892.369 --> 2897.04
ballers just go allama with the fingers

2894.8 --> 2897.04
in their ears

2901.349 --> 2904.349
Georgey

2910.44 --> 2914.17
tired man

2911.95 --> 2917.71
yeah well you've been going for almost

2914.17 --> 2919.54
two hours now well my dogs got a cough

2917.71 --> 2920.92
Ellen for the last three nights he's

2919.54 --> 2924.1
been coughing the night time but not

2920.92 --> 2926.5
like a little he's been going coughing

2924.1 --> 2928.87
coughing up a long cough but he hasn't

2926.5 --> 2930.31
gone away yeah well there's nothing

2928.87 --> 2931.63
coming I don't you think I think he's

2930.31 --> 2933.82
got sort of stuck in his throat it's not

2931.63 --> 2935.56
actually stuck it's just tipping him so

2933.82 --> 2936.88
it's making him like agitated and he

2935.56 --> 2938.44
keeps coughing it keeps waking me up

2936.88 --> 2943.03
every time it's every couple that I was

2938.44 --> 2945.16
like that's odd because this crow has

2943.03 --> 2948.94
been doing that as well like a few days

2945.16 --> 2950.6499999999996
ago it's interesting maybe there is

2948.94 --> 2953.4700000000003
something there maybe there is like a

2950.65 --> 2954.85
cold type psychosomatic response with a

2953.47 --> 2958.54
lot of animals too

2954.85 --> 2962.92
with the with the wind blowing again I

2958.54 --> 2966.54
have said on the show before that I

2962.92 --> 2969.4
think that like extreme air pressure

2966.54 --> 2972.07
sensations on the body and which happens

2969.4 --> 2974.35
with with a with strong winds especially

2972.07 --> 2976.1200000000003
gusts of winds if that's constantly

2974.35 --> 2979.18
presents with a lot of force pressure

2976.12 --> 2982.15
changing force then the body can

2979.18 --> 2985.71
typically get triggered to get a

2982.15 --> 2989.86
psychosomatic response that'll get cold

2985.71 --> 2993.31
situations going so I think that animals

2989.86 --> 2997.9900000000002
probably can have this response as well

2993.31 --> 3001.5299999999997
maybe not as wide as you must as humans

2997.99 --> 3003.12
get it but it's very sparing music says

3001.53 --> 3004.92
dog coughing like that could be a sign

3003.12 --> 3007.77
of pneumonia I did consider pneumonia

3004.92 --> 3009.1800000000003
and but he's got bear in last night he

3007.77 --> 3011.39
was a lot better and - just sleep much

3009.18 --> 3014.1499999999996
better so it seems to be deteriorating

3011.39 --> 3016.8599999999997
better rather than deteriorating because

3014.15 --> 3018.9
basically they say on the vets thing

3016.86 --> 3020.58
give it a week if he hasn't recovered or

3018.9 --> 3022.92
he's not showing signs of recovery after

3020.58 --> 3024.84
a week then you need to go the vets are

3022.92 --> 3028.73
gonna be in the manya because if it were

3024.84 --> 3031.9500000000003
you'd know because that is super painful

3028.73 --> 3033.78
he doesn't have any other part of his

3031.95 --> 3037.0899999999997
health it's just that it's probably just

3033.78 --> 3041.38
a flu and just some flu air and goo

3037.09 --> 3043.0
and just it probably go away don't worry

3041.38 --> 3044.9500000000003
about it I wouldn't worry about it

3043.0 --> 3047.11
as long as she's not in pain you know

3044.95 --> 3050.4399999999996
that's the real sign you should be

3047.11 --> 3051.46
looking forever ego playing ananka says

3050.44 --> 3053.65
lucky stop lying

3051.46 --> 3057.01
well don't you go play in anger right

3053.65 --> 3060.2200000000003
also by the way thank us x0 for the $5

3057.01 --> 3066.2200000000003
super Chan donation here have a cup of

3060.22 --> 3067.56
day shout out to eat some all ski it's

3066.22 --> 3071.89
not the Ritz not the real ISA

3067.56 --> 3073.57
good job that's like let's see yeah give

3071.89 --> 3076.45
him a spot of money he's worthy of a

3073.57 --> 3078.6400000000003
spanner he's a terrorist sympathizer but

3076.45 --> 3081.7599999999998
he's still worthy I don't know does he

3078.64 --> 3085.98
want one with I don't know with great

3081.76 --> 3085.98
ranch is gonna great responsibility

3086.31 --> 3091.72
spare room music says right get back to

3088.57 --> 3093.31
work Lottie you are a dick Lottie this
