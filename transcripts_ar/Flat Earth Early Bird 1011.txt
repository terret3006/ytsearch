137.2 --> 143.83999999999997
a return to normal first in chat

140.0 --> 143.84
good show yesterday you think so

145.84 --> 148.56
i didn't know

150.239 --> 155.04
it was good to get a little loud

152.48 --> 156.79999999999998
that part was good and nobody was home

155.04 --> 158.64
and then pretty much as soon as i

156.8 --> 159.76000000000002
rounded out the show suddenly everybody

158.64 --> 163.11999999999998
came home

159.76 --> 163.12
so it all came together

163.92 --> 168.28
hello mike

165.28 --> 168.28
zadoonich

172.4 --> 177.28
and you misspelled my name in caps

175.12 --> 180.48000000000002
but that's all right

177.28 --> 182.239
no my name's very tough to spell right

180.48 --> 186.07999999999998
hello pj christian

182.239 --> 186.08
mitchell from australia good to see you

186.159 --> 190.79999999999998
yeah i still got my

187.84 --> 190.8
tumeric coffee

192.4 --> 196.87900000000002
because i literally

194.879 --> 198.79999999999998
got out of bed 15 minutes before i was

196.879 --> 202.239
supposed to start the show so i thought

198.8 --> 205.76000000000002
it did pretty damn good

202.239 --> 208.799
only starting 20 minutes late

205.76 --> 208.79899999999998
because i rushed it

208.959 --> 214.959
but i feel rested i didn't go to bed

211.36 --> 214.959
insanely late at least

216.08 --> 219.36
uh hey dusty ryder

222.56 --> 226.879
all right to tell off the nasty email

224.48 --> 228.879
yes

226.879 --> 231.12
and i'm not even sure whether he was

228.879 --> 233.28
like mark smiler but he was exactly

231.12 --> 235.519
doing the same type of thing only he had

233.28 --> 238.84
just this other way of writing in the

235.519 --> 241.20000000000002
email it's so manipulative and

238.84 --> 243.84
dude guess guess what he did he

241.2 --> 247.11999999999998
immediately sent me another email

243.84 --> 250.64000000000001
i i only read the title because it said

247.12 --> 252.56
like oh no i'm not trying to

250.64 --> 256.799
change you uh

252.56 --> 258.32
it's just okay i'm done with this freak

256.799 --> 260.799
like

258.32 --> 260.799
ugh

263.12 --> 267.68
so yeah i did block him now

266.16 --> 269.199
don't know if he found out yet i don't

267.68 --> 271.12
care i don't want to hear from him

269.199 --> 273.68
anymore it's just so annoying i don't

271.12 --> 275.6
know if you actually read that email

273.68 --> 277.28000000000003
i did put it up

275.6 --> 280.56
but it didn't put it up for that long

277.28 --> 283.84
but yeah you could basically

280.56 --> 283.84
freeze frame it

284.24 --> 288.16
because i just can't stand to even look

286.639 --> 290.479
at that

288.16 --> 294.28000000000003
it's so annoying to me

290.479 --> 294.28
it feels so invasive

304.8 --> 310.479
creepy o'reilly opinion

307.6 --> 312.8
no i didn't get any feedback from that

310.479 --> 312.8
at all

319.039 --> 324.36
i have still no idea what that was about

327.84 --> 333.84
don't you like sleeping water here yeah

330.4 --> 337.67999999999995
well he's not the perfect guy but he's

333.84 --> 340.4
like i know him for a very long time

337.68 --> 344.0
and at least he does have loyalty

340.4 --> 345.84
like he has a very good sense of that

344.0 --> 347.759
so

345.84 --> 350.08
i don't know what he did that's

347.759 --> 355.039
supposedly so bad but i get the feeling

350.08 --> 355.039
it's all being just maximal twisting

356.16 --> 359.199
it's

357.039 --> 362.59999999999997
yeah

359.199 --> 362.6
i don't know

374.72 --> 379.40000000000003
it was a very rowdy show yesterday

384.639 --> 387.52
yeah mitchell from australia you're

386.639 --> 391.039
great

387.52 --> 394.68
that stream with david weiss

391.039 --> 394.68
was pretty good

405.84 --> 410.56
oh right yeah idea didn't have any

408.16 --> 413.03900000000004
stream yesterday right i thought didn't

410.56 --> 413.039
see any

414.24 --> 419.039
he did have that video

416.4 --> 421.44
about the v and all that

419.039 --> 423.28
and the sea

421.44 --> 425.68
you're taking some risks with that by

423.28 --> 425.67999999999995
the way

427.12 --> 432.639
so one got removed but you got to be

429.28 --> 436.88
careful man because

432.639 --> 438.88
youtube doesn't really take kindly to

436.88 --> 441.28
youtube accounts uploading those types

438.88 --> 443.44
of videos

441.28 --> 445.19899999999996
but i don't know

443.44 --> 448.199
you do what you feel you need to have to

445.199 --> 448.199
do

450.479 --> 455.68
they are good videos so

453.36 --> 455.68
all right

459.039 --> 461.84
yeah yesterday

463.36 --> 469.44
what was i watching yesterday

466.319 --> 469.44
oh yeah the

471.84 --> 478.4
the premiere it was from monday i think

474.8 --> 480.639
i don't know why he played that one

478.4 --> 482.0
what it was from one day was it or was

480.639 --> 484.0
it

482.0 --> 486.24
the friday show after all i'm not sure

484.0 --> 487.52
it was a bit confused but god was i

486.24 --> 489.759
rambly

487.52 --> 492.71999999999997
was i freaking rambly i just never

489.759 --> 494.40000000000003
stopped

492.72 --> 495.91900000000004
i guess i must have been in one of those

494.4 --> 498.63899999999995
moods where i was just rambling

495.919 --> 498.639
endlessly

499.12 --> 503.28000000000003
it's weird because when i'm like that i

501.039 --> 505.44
really feel like everybody wants to hear

503.28 --> 505.44
me

505.759 --> 508.47900000000004
it's weird

509.84 --> 514.3199999999999
it's very hard to put a lid on it when

511.759 --> 514.32
i'm like that

515.279 --> 519.479
it was really excellent

523.039 --> 526.959
yesterday show even

525.279 --> 529.04
because now i was talking about the flat

526.959 --> 531.04
earth debates premiere and that was from

529.04 --> 532.399
friday and it was super rambly on that i

531.04 --> 534.88
think it was friday or it could have

532.399 --> 536.56
been monday because he started late

534.88 --> 538.56
i thought that was

536.56 --> 541.1199999999999
monday

538.56 --> 543.76
where he just suddenly showed up

541.12 --> 543.76
really late

543.839 --> 547.2
never even said why

545.6 --> 548.9590000000001
so that's what made me think it was

547.2 --> 552.88
actually the monday show and it was

548.959 --> 552.88
apparently very rambly on that one

553.279 --> 559.959
i was excellent on that one too okay

556.0 --> 559.959
well thank you dusty ryder

563.68 --> 566.7199999999999
i don't know what it is

567.279 --> 573.68
maybe i'm now looking at my own material

570.08 --> 576.08
and i'm like uh that's not good enough

573.68 --> 579.12
you're not good enough i don't know

576.08 --> 579.12
maybe it is the

580.0 --> 583.92
it's autumn

582.64 --> 586.3199999999999
it's full

583.92 --> 589.04
approaching i do tend to get like that

586.32 --> 591.36
and then once i notice that i kind of

589.04 --> 593.5999999999999
like put a lid on that like okay yeah

591.36 --> 595.6
i'll just shut up about it or everybody

593.6 --> 597.6800000000001
might get like that and that's very

595.6 --> 599.44
annoying to be constantly

597.68 --> 601.12
annoyed by yourself

599.44 --> 603.2790000000001
so i wouldn't want to

601.12 --> 607.04
have other people

603.279 --> 607.04
infected by that spirit as well

608.56 --> 613.8
it was friday

610.64 --> 613.8
all right

629.44 --> 634.6400000000001
right so everybody's doing okay got a

632.48 --> 638.839
good vibe of the chat

634.64 --> 638.8389999999999
i am open for any subjects

650.079 --> 655.3599999999999
i am noticing that i am having a lot of

653.519 --> 658.9590000000001
like

655.36 --> 661.6800000000001
strength again in chats

658.959 --> 664.0
it's really weird in a way because

661.68 --> 666.2399999999999
me doing my own live show is very

664.0 --> 667.92
different from when i basically visit

666.24 --> 670.0
somebody else's show

667.92 --> 671.92
and then i stick the chat it's a whole

670.0 --> 674.16
different game

671.92 --> 676.7199999999999
and like my energies work differently

674.16 --> 678.399
and i get just like massive compact

676.72 --> 680.88
inspiration it's a skill that i've

678.399 --> 684.48
trained even before i started

680.88 --> 686.399
to do my own live shows like get in chat

684.48 --> 687.519
and just compact

686.399 --> 690.56
as much

687.519 --> 691.6
possible information

690.56 --> 695.68
together

691.6 --> 697.9200000000001
in as a concise way possible so

695.68 --> 700.2399999999999
that it doesn't feel overfilled it's

697.92 --> 703.279
just really concise information that has

700.24 --> 705.839
massive as much fractal implica

703.279 --> 707.76
fractal implicationary

705.839 --> 709.6800000000001
compatibility

707.76 --> 712.0
imaginable

709.68 --> 715.12
and that's what i like to do and joke

712.0 --> 715.12
around too in that way

715.44 --> 718.0
and i am

716.56 --> 720.399
yeah that

718.0 --> 723.279
strength has increased recently and it's

720.399 --> 725.2
also good that i found just places live

723.279 --> 727.4399999999999
streams where i feel i'm being

725.2 --> 730.72
appreciated

727.44 --> 732.9590000000001
i did it a lot when owen benjamin was

730.72 --> 736.8000000000001
like still on d live

732.959 --> 739.5999999999999
and on youtube like get in that chat

736.8 --> 739.5999999999999
be the chat

739.76 --> 745.519
and it's always very exhilarating for me

742.56 --> 748.8
to do that because i feel very strong

745.519 --> 748.8
when i just do that

750.959 --> 756.3199999999999
and it's great to hang around and

752.48 --> 759.2
mitchell from australia's chat a lot

756.32 --> 761.12
and i yeah he appreciates me you don't

759.2 --> 764.0790000000001
don't want him to like overpush it or

761.12 --> 766.079
anything right i'm just a chat visitor

764.079 --> 768.4799999999999
but yeah he is very much into the

766.079 --> 772.0
mechanics of the

768.48 --> 774.8000000000001
the flat earth debates

772.0 --> 778.959
the mechanics of of flat earth and the

774.8 --> 781.8389999999999
arguments and i really like to

778.959 --> 783.3599999999999
always remind people about that in chats

781.839 --> 786.36
and yeah

783.36 --> 786.36
mitchell

786.88 --> 790.16
reads out what i say a lot i like that

789.36 --> 792.5600000000001
right

790.16 --> 795.519
it just makes me feel good

792.56 --> 797.3599999999999
but i do it for everybody to see like it

795.519 --> 801.0
is it is just me passing on the

797.36 --> 801.0
information really

803.68 --> 808.8
but it's great i like it i like his

805.92 --> 810.399
streams you have the best

808.8 --> 815.3199999999999
backgrounds

810.399 --> 815.32
what a contrast to me sitting in my room

818.88 --> 824.399
hey slow mo moon buggy neil cosentino

821.68 --> 824.399
good to see you

825.839 --> 831.36
right and by the way say the same goes

828.16 --> 836.3199999999999
for the the gymbop streams

831.36 --> 836.32
made by jim bob dude is freaking awesome

836.399 --> 840.88
and he is

837.92 --> 841.8389999999999
very much into the flat earth debates

840.88 --> 845.12
like

841.839 --> 848.1600000000001
he's been to that school

845.12 --> 850.72
and he's done shout outs and

848.16 --> 854.079
constantly references

850.72 --> 857.76
just the the arguments

854.079 --> 860.7199999999999
and he like he's he's going into like a

857.76 --> 862.959
a troll off with sean hawkins he's even

860.72 --> 866.639
made an a voice for him

862.959 --> 866.6389999999999
it's really amazing

867.839 --> 871.1990000000001
and it's been great being in his chats

869.519 --> 873.76
too

871.199 --> 876.8
so yeah for me it's been great

873.76 --> 876.8
just being out there

878.079 --> 883.56
how am i doing neil

880.24 --> 883.5600000000001
i'm okay

884.399 --> 889.12
starting to transition emotionally more

887.68 --> 891.5999999999999
towards the

889.12 --> 893.6
the autumn time

891.6 --> 896.6
but my energy levels are still pretty

893.6 --> 896.6
good

906.88 --> 911.04
a cockatoo really

908.959 --> 914.0
when did that happen i must have missed

911.04 --> 917.92
that one dusty writing

914.0 --> 917.92
because yeah i have seen sharks there

919.44 --> 922.24
whales

920.88 --> 925.88
really

922.24 --> 925.88
why did that happen

939.199 --> 941.8389999999999
first episode

943.44 --> 947.6
okay

944.48 --> 949.839
i didn't watch back the older streams

947.6 --> 952.8000000000001
pretty much when mitchell came onto the

949.839 --> 954.639
scene on the flat earth debate

952.8 --> 958.4799999999999
got shout outs from nathan that's when i

954.639 --> 958.48
first find out found out about him

965.36 --> 969.48
huh

966.48 --> 969.48
cool

972.56 --> 978.7589999999999
yeah

974.16 --> 978.759
yeah what are my subscribers now

983.759 --> 988.639
right it's

985.8 --> 991.12
2030 now

988.639 --> 991.12
it's nice

994.48 --> 999.12
maybe i'm gonna get a steady growth now

996.48 --> 999.12
after all

1005.44 --> 1010.5600000000001
yeah so thanks everybody that subscribed

1008.16 --> 1012.24
i i get the feeling there are just new

1010.56 --> 1013.8389999999999
people like

1012.24 --> 1015.04
actually finding my channel and

1013.839 --> 1018.639
subscribing

1015.04 --> 1020.3199999999999
despite what whatever the numbers say

1018.639 --> 1022.5600000000001
because i have no idea how many people

1020.32 --> 1024.88
are really following my channel

1022.56 --> 1027.839
and again i've said it a couple of times

1024.88 --> 1030.0
i often get the weird sensation that

1027.839 --> 1034.24
there's like a lot

1030.0 --> 1034.24
more people actually watching and like

1035.12 --> 1038.6789999999999
keeping it silent

1041.52 --> 1046.24
but then again then i watch my actual

1043.919 --> 1049.8400000000001
streams back and then i'm like

1046.24 --> 1052.16
are people really watching this

1049.84 --> 1054.559
i don't get it and that's really weird

1052.16 --> 1056.16
re feeling a realization when i have

1054.559 --> 1058.0
that because

1056.16 --> 1061.2
while i'm doing what i'm doing it

1058.0 --> 1061.2
doesn't feel like that at all

1061.6 --> 1068.08
there is a gradual incline in subs

1066.08 --> 1070.799
yeah

1068.08 --> 1074.08
it's a trickling

1070.799 --> 1074.08
a trickling in effect

1076.0 --> 1080.72
if blue dots on the flat earth people

1078.96 --> 1082.64
app

1080.72 --> 1085.44
in netherland

1082.64 --> 1087.44
orphanage what

1085.44 --> 1090.24
right yeah i'm not part of that app as

1087.44 --> 1090.24
far as i know

1091.28 --> 1096.48
dude i don't even have a phone to use

1093.2 --> 1096.48
that sort of app with

1101.52 --> 1105.44
oh gradual increase yeah i thought

1103.52 --> 1109.84
that's what you meant

1105.44 --> 1109.8400000000001
incline is like a decrease right

1112.799 --> 1117.039
dude i have to up my game with my

1114.88 --> 1120.6000000000001
freaking english

1117.039 --> 1120.6
i really do

1123.039 --> 1129.12
i mean

1124.32 --> 1129.12
english is so incredibly vast

1135.039 --> 1139.919
oh wait incline is something different

1137.52 --> 1142.6399999999999
it's not a decrease

1139.919 --> 1145.679
it's like an impulse

1142.64 --> 1148.16
it's an impulse thing hmm

1145.679 --> 1151.799
being inclined to do something yeah i

1148.16 --> 1151.799
know it like that

1162.64 --> 1167.2800000000002
yeah that's right cairo apple yeah

1164.64 --> 1170.88
there's david weiss's app

1167.28 --> 1170.8799999999999
very long name what is it again

1173.2 --> 1176.64
god i can't remember

1177.36 --> 1185.52
it's like the flat earth sun moon

1181.76 --> 1188.24
stars zodiac

1185.52 --> 1188.24
clock app

1190.16 --> 1193.8400000000001
it was the flat earth like before the

1192.24 --> 1195.28
clock i don't know where it was i

1193.84 --> 1198.72
thought it wasn't i don't know but it

1195.28 --> 1198.72
was like a whole mouthful

1199.36 --> 1204.4799999999998
device has like demonstrated on screen

1201.84 --> 1208.48
it does really look very well made

1204.48 --> 1208.48
it's not without it's not perfect

1208.64 --> 1213.44
they have some like technical tinkering

1210.96 --> 1215.919
issues but that's always with any

1213.44 --> 1218.24
elaborate program

1215.919 --> 1219.039
it takes a lot of time to iron that all

1218.24 --> 1221.52
out

1219.039 --> 1223.52
for the programmers

1221.52 --> 1226.96
but yeah it looked pretty good

1223.52 --> 1229.36
i have not even seen the other one

1226.96 --> 1233.72
but i've heard about it nathan oakley

1229.36 --> 1233.7199999999998
talked about that on his show

1246.84 --> 1254.8799999999999
what incline can be

1250.08 --> 1254.8799999999999
a bench press lifted at an angle

1255.039 --> 1259.72
oh okay

1256.72 --> 1259.72
huh

1268.32 --> 1271.6789999999999
wow

1269.28 --> 1274.84
it's just the ways that english is

1271.679 --> 1279.3600000000001
applied it's just so

1274.84 --> 1279.36
vast i'm very happy with the

1280.0 --> 1285.28
available grammar

1281.84 --> 1287.12
that i can apply i do improvise a lot

1285.28 --> 1289.52
and

1287.12 --> 1292.3999999999999
so often what i say

1289.52 --> 1296.799
despite being comprehensible is pretty

1292.4 --> 1299.3600000000001
kind of like grafted together like

1296.799 --> 1301.679
real properly studied english people

1299.36 --> 1303.36
they could definitely hear

1301.679 --> 1305.3600000000001
when they listen to me that i'm not

1303.36 --> 1308.24
english

1305.36 --> 1310.8799999999999
sometimes i get it really smooth and out

1308.24 --> 1313.44
other times it is really me just

1310.88 --> 1315.919
kind of constructing it together

1313.44 --> 1318.3200000000002
making it sound smooth enough but it is

1315.919 --> 1321.2
definitely audible

1318.32 --> 1324.08
that i'm not english in origin

1321.2 --> 1324.0800000000002
i do my best

1326.24 --> 1331.0
sloped accent what

1344.88 --> 1350.0
right but hey studying english

1347.679 --> 1350.0
it is

1350.72 --> 1355.52
it is like a lifetime occupation

1353.52 --> 1357.039
even my old english teachers would say

1355.52 --> 1359.039
that

1357.039 --> 1359.76
but now with all the streams out there

1359.039 --> 1361.52
and

1359.76 --> 1363.679
all the streams

1361.52 --> 1364.799
in english

1363.679 --> 1367.919
it's like

1364.799 --> 1370.96
even if it's not super interesting what

1367.919 --> 1373.2800000000002
they're talking about or in that moment

1370.96 --> 1375.6000000000001
still you you get their vernacular you

1373.28 --> 1378.6399999999999
get what they learn and

1375.6 --> 1378.6399999999999
what they use

1380.0 --> 1385.039
it's like how people use words

1383.12 --> 1387.6
to basically

1385.039 --> 1389.36
strengthen their confidence

1387.6 --> 1392.08
or to

1389.36 --> 1394.24
get a certain flair

1392.08 --> 1395.9189999999999
that you want to use

1394.24 --> 1397.6
to kind of like that's how you would

1395.919 --> 1400.8400000000001
like to see

1397.6 --> 1403.36
how you would p like people to see

1400.84 --> 1407.1999999999998
you that's also interesting because it

1403.36 --> 1409.12
is basically minor communication magic

1407.2 --> 1412.799
so for me

1409.12 --> 1417.36
there's like two two different projects

1412.799 --> 1419.12
in at which i engage media with one

1417.36 --> 1422.0
is knowledge

1419.12 --> 1424.3999999999999
and is like lore well knowledge gloria

1422.0 --> 1427.039
it's kind of the same thing

1424.4 --> 1429.039
of what is out there with the ideas out

1427.039 --> 1431.679
there

1429.039 --> 1433.919
and

1431.679 --> 1436.159
like how the world works mechanically

1433.919 --> 1438.96
and historically and then there's the

1436.159 --> 1441.44
other and that is just communication

1438.96 --> 1444.24
just language

1441.44 --> 1446.799
and feelings of the person and what they

1444.24 --> 1450.799
want to accomplish it's like a whole

1446.799 --> 1454.08
other layer just as rich

1450.799 --> 1454.08
as lore itself

1455.84 --> 1463.1999999999998
i sound american

1459.279 --> 1463.2
i sound do i sound american

1463.919 --> 1467.679
i don't sound very british

1470.24 --> 1477.919
i mean i like i that is trainable

1474.159 --> 1477.919
it's funny because when i was younger

1478.48 --> 1483.1200000000001
there was a lot of like

1480.48 --> 1486.799
we were watching a lot of bbc

1483.12 --> 1488.7199999999998
things like monty python and

1486.799 --> 1489.76
british comedies

1488.72 --> 1491.039
so

1489.76 --> 1493.679
i

1491.039 --> 1496.24
i was confronted with a lot of british

1493.679 --> 1499.3600000000001
accent and that really made me kind of

1496.24 --> 1501.279
like want to talk british and i did

1499.36 --> 1503.1999999999998
like as a little kid even i would get

1501.279 --> 1507.2
the british accent really well and

1503.2 --> 1509.039
wouldn't say it so much right because

1507.2 --> 1510.799
knowledge about how to utilize the

1509.039 --> 1513.279
language wasn't that broad but it could

1510.799 --> 1514.96
definitely construct a proper sounding

1513.279 --> 1516.799
sentence

1514.96 --> 1518.4
and we try to communicate with other

1516.799 --> 1521.039
kids

1518.4 --> 1523.52
and i remember distinctly

1521.039 --> 1525.76
it was like 8

1523.52 --> 1527.76
10 or something in spain and there was

1525.76 --> 1530.72
just this

1527.76 --> 1531.679
english family and english kids and i

1530.72 --> 1534.24
like

1531.679 --> 1536.0800000000002
i acted like i also came from england

1534.24 --> 1538.24
and they bought it

1536.08 --> 1540.6399999999999
and that was a real kick like holy [ __ ]

1538.24 --> 1542.96
he really thinks i'm a british kid

1540.64 --> 1546.0800000000002
this is yeah

1542.96 --> 1549.1200000000001
so i it all depends

1546.08 --> 1551.1999999999998
this is my default english

1549.12 --> 1554.3999999999999
like this is my

1551.2 --> 1557.1200000000001
well my assembled self-constructed form

1554.4 --> 1558.24
of english and i guess it has a lot of

1557.12 --> 1559.6789999999999
american

1558.24 --> 1561.679
in it

1559.679 --> 1565.279
because there's a lot of options a lot

1561.679 --> 1565.279
of choices within the

1565.52 --> 1568.559
within the structure

1568.799 --> 1573.82
that's the right word

1570.59 --> 1573.82
[Music]

1574.159 --> 1578.88
the relief yeah the structure the

1576.159 --> 1581.0390000000002
surface structure of

1578.88 --> 1582.96
what tone do you pick

1581.039 --> 1584.72
how do you inflect

1582.96 --> 1587.039
there's a lot of difference between

1584.72 --> 1589.679
english and american

1587.039 --> 1592.96
right and i do tend to typically pick

1589.679 --> 1595.279
the american choice more and sometimes i

1592.96 --> 1599.159
do pick the british one

1595.279 --> 1599.159
a little odd like that

1599.52 --> 1603.9189999999999
i've noticed like how consistently

1601.679 --> 1605.679
american choices

1603.919 --> 1608.159
are made by americans within the

1605.679 --> 1609.2
language and how persistent the

1608.159 --> 1612.48
british

1609.2 --> 1614.559
the english irish and scottish people

1612.48 --> 1616.64
pick the british inflections just that

1614.559 --> 1618.32
has stood out to me how incredibly

1616.64 --> 1619.1200000000001
consistent that has been and hey i've

1618.32 --> 1620.559
been

1619.12 --> 1623.12
surrounded

1620.559 --> 1625.44
by british and american

1623.12 --> 1628.799
and australian too

1625.44 --> 1630.64
so like i get to see that size that up

1628.799 --> 1632.96
sometimes it feels like i'm in the other

1630.64 --> 1635.8400000000001
dimension just with a piece of paper

1632.96 --> 1636.88
making notes like that okay

1635.84 --> 1640.52
right

1636.88 --> 1640.5200000000002
that's how it is

1641.919 --> 1647.6000000000001
that's what i do that's

1644.48 --> 1647.6
that's my uh

1648.64 --> 1655.76
higher dimensional self studying

1651.6 --> 1658.8799999999999
the very fabric energy of reality

1655.76 --> 1658.8799999999999
that's what i like to do

1661.039 --> 1665.6
needle sounds like a new york yeah no

1663.279 --> 1665.6
[ __ ]

1666.0 --> 1672.279
can't get more new new yorker than neil

1687.039 --> 1693.279
picking up the twang of the american

1689.039 --> 1693.279
accent right stallion 80 12.

1693.6 --> 1699.6789999999999
but it's not surprising though you see

1696.559 --> 1702.0
i've been listening to alex jones for 15

1699.679 --> 1703.3600000000001
years

1702.0 --> 1706.399
and

1703.36 --> 1708.1589999999999
it's been consistently daily

1706.399 --> 1710.1589999999999
sometimes i just really don't want to

1708.159 --> 1712.0800000000002
watch him

1710.159 --> 1714.88
because he does get like

1712.08 --> 1717.4399999999998
actually really annoying moods

1714.88 --> 1719.919
where he basically just mistreats people

1717.44 --> 1720.64
and [ __ ] and he can't stop that he's

1719.919 --> 1723.2
like

1720.64 --> 1724.96
possessed by like a weird distorting

1723.2 --> 1728.3990000000001
spirit

1724.96 --> 1731.3600000000001
he knows that he has his moods

1728.399 --> 1734.399
but most of the time i just

1731.36 --> 1734.399
i just watch it

1734.48 --> 1737.84
and there is

1736.0 --> 1741.279
that's also part of what i find

1737.84 --> 1745.039
interesting about those shows

1741.279 --> 1747.36
about the guests the guest hosts too

1745.039 --> 1750.08
what guess no the hosts all the hosts

1747.36 --> 1752.9599999999998
alex jones and owen troyer and

1750.08 --> 1755.6789999999999
harrison smith and the others

1752.96 --> 1757.279
is that they typically do like to put in

1755.679 --> 1759.8400000000001
like

1757.279 --> 1763.76
american language historically

1759.84 --> 1766.08
significant phrases and sayings and

1763.76 --> 1767.76
so i've heard a lot of those come by

1766.08 --> 1769.6789999999999
over the years

1767.76 --> 1772.64
and that did

1769.679 --> 1776.72
kind of like settle in so sometimes i

1772.64 --> 1776.72
pop out some american saying

1778.159 --> 1785.8400000000001
now if i'd had been persistently

1781.2 --> 1785.8400000000001
watching a british show like that

1786.159 --> 1790.0
instead

1787.36 --> 1792.4799999999998
then i'd probably be popping out a whole

1790.0 --> 1795.2
bunch of british things

1792.48 --> 1797.3600000000001
this is just what are you exposed to

1795.2 --> 1799.679
and i've been exposed to american for a

1797.36 --> 1803.12
very long time now

1799.679 --> 1805.8400000000001
it started with optimus prime

1803.12 --> 1805.84
when i was like

1806.84 --> 1810.24
six right

1815.34 --> 1818.53
[Music]

1819.039 --> 1823.399
gatekeeper to some things yeah

1844.88 --> 1849.24
alex turns out to be ciao

1852.88 --> 1858.48
well there is just they are part of

1856.08 --> 1859.84
narrative manipulation like they have

1858.48 --> 1861.1200000000001
objectives

1859.84 --> 1864.72
it is

1861.12 --> 1868.4799999999998
very blatantly apparent is that cia what

1864.72 --> 1870.48
is cia even anymore

1868.48 --> 1874.64
like what is that what does that even

1870.48 --> 1874.64
mean anymore when somebody says that

1875.76 --> 1879.76
because yeah cia

1878.559 --> 1882.72
are

1879.76 --> 1885.12
manipulators

1882.72 --> 1886.72
does that mean they're all on the same

1885.12 --> 1888.0
side

1886.72 --> 1891.3600000000001
i think it's

1888.0 --> 1894.64
a much more decentralized

1891.36 --> 1894.6399999999999
group than you'd think

1894.72 --> 1898.72
they all do their own thing and

1896.72 --> 1900.96
sometimes they work together

1898.72 --> 1902.72
it is like they are

1900.96 --> 1904.64
like a freemason

1902.72 --> 1907.279
guild

1904.64 --> 1909.279
but their cia they're like their own

1907.279 --> 1912.399
guild

1909.279 --> 1914.48
cooperative mechanisms pre

1912.399 --> 1916.7199999999998
programming

1914.48 --> 1919.72
but it's not like they're all

1916.72 --> 1919.72
allies

1920.32 --> 1926.72
so yeah what does it even mean anymore

1923.679 --> 1928.96
if somebody turns out to be ciafcia

1926.72 --> 1931.76
influences is manipulating things does

1928.96 --> 1936.64
that mean they are evil

1931.76 --> 1936.64
are they to be ignored completely

1939.84 --> 1943.36
if you know a better source

1941.679 --> 1946.0800000000002
you know

1943.36 --> 1947.1999999999998
because i do get a lot of info even

1946.08 --> 1949.12
sometimes

1947.2 --> 1952.159
pushed on to me

1949.12 --> 1954.1589999999999
with a misinforming angle

1952.159 --> 1956.3990000000001
with a manipulation

1954.159 --> 1958.3990000000001
i still get the information through

1956.399 --> 1960.7199999999998
there

1958.399 --> 1960.7199999999998
right

1961.039 --> 1966.1589999999999
it's like nathan says

1964.24 --> 1968.559
just swallow the meat and spit out the

1966.159 --> 1971.1200000000001
bones that's what i do with alex jones

1968.559 --> 1972.6399999999999
that's what i had to learn

1971.12 --> 1974.799
10 years ago

1972.64 --> 1977.2
because it was driving me nuts back then

1974.799 --> 1979.679
because i actually did thought like it

1977.2 --> 1982.0800000000002
was all quite literal and made me quite

1979.679 --> 1984.64
paranoid too

1982.08 --> 1986.96
but yeah that's just

1984.64 --> 1988.24
reality does that to you and there are

1986.96 --> 1990.3990000000001
things about

1988.24 --> 1994.72
all of that even the fear porn that are

1990.399 --> 1994.7199999999998
real it's just the way it's presented

1995.12 --> 2001.5189999999998
is presented with an objective to really

1998.48 --> 2004.799
rile you up make you fear bound in a way

2001.519 --> 2006.799
so that you keep paying attention

2004.799 --> 2010.1589999999999
right

2006.799 --> 2012.559
it's been like alex's original tactic to

2010.159 --> 2014.96
get out there to get to everybody to

2012.559 --> 2017.9189999999999
literally get to them right that's why

2014.96 --> 2019.76
he was seen as a troll by a lot of

2017.919 --> 2022.48
people back then because he was always

2019.76 --> 2024.08
just getting in your face

2022.48 --> 2026.159
and like super

2024.08 --> 2028.399
agitating

2026.159 --> 2030.64
fair sewing

2028.399 --> 2034.8799999999999
but based on things

2030.64 --> 2034.88
statements and papers that are real

2035.519 --> 2040.48
you see

2037.919 --> 2043.039
so when somebody says ooh isn't he a

2040.48 --> 2045.1200000000001
gatekeeper isn't he cia

2043.039 --> 2047.279
well what if he was

2045.12 --> 2049.359
does it matter

2047.279 --> 2053.919
seriously what'd you think of it does it

2049.359 --> 2056.159
matter yes in a way it does matter

2053.919 --> 2060.44
but does that mean it all has to be just

2056.159 --> 2060.44
discarded no way

2062.639 --> 2065.639
right

2075.76 --> 2080.96
i said there are many times i don't feel

2078.0 --> 2080.96
like watching him

2081.76 --> 2087.0400000000004
many times no not many times it's just

2085.44 --> 2089.839
periodically

2087.04 --> 2089.839
right

2095.28 --> 2100.5600000000004
like it's so weird because some it's

2098.64 --> 2104.16
kind of the same effect as with me

2100.56 --> 2104.16
because when he's in a weird mood

2104.32 --> 2108.88
there a lot of interesting things can

2106.8 --> 2111.44
come out of it

2108.88 --> 2113.44
right in a way it's just

2111.44 --> 2114.32
personal

2113.44 --> 2117.599
it

2114.32 --> 2120.1600000000003
it's hard to explain what that is

2117.599 --> 2123.76
like when he is out of control

2120.16 --> 2127.2799999999997
it's also um sometimes the most valuable

2123.76 --> 2130.32
moments in many different ways also in

2127.28 --> 2132.079
personal background and

2130.32 --> 2134.0
yeah

2132.079 --> 2136.4
things that they are

2134.0 --> 2138.24
bumping into

2136.4 --> 2140.32
on their own

2138.24 --> 2144.7599999999998
not what they present it's very

2140.32 --> 2144.76
revealing those moments

2147.119 --> 2152.0
right i've just learned a lot like

2149.52 --> 2154.32
whether he's a freaking gatekeeper cia

2152.0 --> 2156.16
or bill hicks or whatever like i i

2154.32 --> 2158.56
really don't care

2156.16 --> 2160.56
i don't care i know

2158.56 --> 2162.56
it could be

2160.56 --> 2164.0789999999997
there's certainly traits

2162.56 --> 2167.7999999999997
there

2164.079 --> 2167.8
doesn't really matter

2173.52 --> 2176.64
just uh yeah

2179.119 --> 2183.119
this is what it is

2180.8 --> 2187.3590000000004
you hope it doesn't get worse there's no

2183.119 --> 2189.92
indication it would get worse

2187.359 --> 2191.7599999999998
many ways alex is

2189.92 --> 2194.64
upgrading

2191.76 --> 2197.2400000000002
he's upgrading his game his game with

2194.64 --> 2200.24
language game with

2197.24 --> 2201.68
storytelling he's investing a lot of

2200.24 --> 2202.9599999999996
energy in

2201.68 --> 2205.2799999999997
putting down

2202.96 --> 2206.96
epic sounding stories with a lot of

2205.28 --> 2209.0400000000004
energy in them

2206.96 --> 2211.119
he's not always as good as it but that

2209.04 --> 2214.64
he's just really fascinated with doing

2211.119 --> 2216.56
that and i totally get that

2214.64 --> 2218.16
because i got that too it's one of the

2216.56 --> 2219.599
things that i actually really

2218.16 --> 2222.16
appreciated him

2219.599 --> 2224.32
by with

2222.16 --> 2226.3999999999996
because he started doing that and i had

2224.32 --> 2228.56
that too where you just like get this

2226.4 --> 2230.48
vision

2228.56 --> 2232.32
and all the information comes together

2230.48 --> 2234.88
and it's like really readily available

2232.32 --> 2238.2000000000003
and you just share it

2234.88 --> 2238.2000000000003
on the spot

2253.359 --> 2257.92
what are my views

2255.44 --> 2260.7200000000003
on that phuket word

2257.92 --> 2263.28
this is not even forget where this is

2260.72 --> 2266.64
sock account

2263.28 --> 2268.079
my views it is that it makes some people

2266.64 --> 2271.1189999999997
squirt

2268.079 --> 2273.599
and start to make sock accounts

2271.119 --> 2277.2000000000003
to want to remember everybody to make

2273.599 --> 2277.2000000000003
them kind of uncomfortable

2277.68 --> 2283.2799999999997
and that it's really a petty way to

2280.079 --> 2286.7200000000003
spend your time and your focus like

2283.28 --> 2289.119
especially that you focus on doing that

2286.72 --> 2291.68
that it seems like it's a worthwhile

2289.119 --> 2294.32
occupation to you

2291.68 --> 2297.1189999999997
to make sock accounts just to tell that

2294.32 --> 2299.3590000000004
sort of thing in people's chats

2297.119 --> 2303.4
yeah that's what i think about it how

2299.359 --> 2303.4
about that as an answer

2310.89 --> 2314.83
[Music]

2318.48 --> 2323.04
i already had made my comments about

2320.48 --> 2323.04
that yeah

2323.359 --> 2328.0
i'm not here to be your robotic

2326.24 --> 2330.3199999999997
answering machine

2328.0 --> 2332.16
that constantly says the same thing over

2330.32 --> 2334.56
and over again because you make new sock

2332.16 --> 2337.839
accounts saying the same stupid things

2334.56 --> 2337.839
over and over again yeah

2337.92 --> 2341.32
how about that

2342.56 --> 2347.599
bad karma don't

2345.2 --> 2348.96
inquire you were there man

2347.599 --> 2350.6400000000003
yesterday

2348.96 --> 2353.96
or were you

2350.64 --> 2353.96
i don't know

2354.079 --> 2358.0
don't care just get out

2358.079 --> 2362.4
stop whining about other people

2364.88 --> 2368.6800000000003
who gives a [ __ ]

2380.72 --> 2386.8799999999997
oh you weren't there

2383.44 --> 2386.88
doc appointment no there

2392.32 --> 2397.839
all right

2393.44 --> 2397.839
yeah i'm gonna need some

2398.4 --> 2401.76
troll assistance here

2405.28 --> 2409.96
probably

2406.96 --> 2409.96
probably

2410.0 --> 2414.88
dominoid getting a little sloppy there

2412.079 --> 2414.88
with the spelling

2421.599 --> 2424.599
okay

2427.119 --> 2433.2400000000002
go to the doctor for that

2430.24 --> 2433.24
okay

2440.56 --> 2445.359
probably is how aussies say oh

2443.04 --> 2445.359
really

2446.48 --> 2451.119
i mean it does sound like that

2449.04 --> 2453.599
when they when they use it but

2451.119 --> 2457.6400000000003
i didn't know you'd also indulge in

2453.599 --> 2457.6400000000003
spelling it like that

2474.96 --> 2481.7200000000003
what neat and tub no

2476.96 --> 2481.7200000000003
oh my god bad karma that's

2484.16 --> 2488.96
oh antibiotics are so unbelievably

2487.28 --> 2490.8390000000004
overused

2488.96 --> 2494.56
like really you're gonna take

2490.839 --> 2496.96
antibiotics for a sinus infection for

2494.56 --> 2496.96
real

2497.119 --> 2502.0
why

2498.88 --> 2504.4
why would you do that

2502.0 --> 2506.64
you know that [ __ ] like completely ruins

2504.4 --> 2509.64
your gut flora right why would you do

2506.64 --> 2509.64
that

2511.359 --> 2515.359
like do you even have proof there is

2513.44 --> 2518.2400000000002
some supposed

2515.359 --> 2520.4
bacterial infection like is that what it

2518.24 --> 2520.3999999999996
is

2521.359 --> 2526.24
i mean do you have like a really a

2523.28 --> 2529.28
pressuring red

2526.24 --> 2530.72
painful to the touch type of wound

2529.28 --> 2533.52
okay

2530.72 --> 2535.9199999999996
right then maybe that's like a serious

2533.52 --> 2537.7599999999998
inflammation situation then i'd say okay

2535.92 --> 2541.839
well maybe antibiotics yeah yeah

2537.76 --> 2541.8390000000004
although i try colloidal silver first

2542.319 --> 2547.599
right which doesn't destroy your gut

2544.24 --> 2551.359
flora you can apply topically

2547.599 --> 2555.52
and hey how about oregano oil right much

2551.359 --> 2559.68
much better there's so many other things

2555.52 --> 2559.68
you could do besides antibiotics

2559.76 --> 2564.7200000000003
like why would you go to a doctor with

2562.0 --> 2566.64
something like that

2564.72 --> 2568.9599999999996
why i don't know i don't get it i don't

2566.64 --> 2571.04
get why people are so quick to run to a

2568.96 --> 2572.96
doctor for so just

2571.04 --> 2574.0
typical regular

2572.96 --> 2577.319
things

2574.0 --> 2577.319
i don't know

2580.8 --> 2585.44
you have no clue why

2583.2 --> 2587.4399999999996
but you took it anyway

2585.44 --> 2588.64
so you didn't actually go into

2587.44 --> 2592.16
discussion

2588.64 --> 2595.16
about it with your doctor

2592.16 --> 2595.16
what

2624.0 --> 2627.0
hmm

2636.72 --> 2639.7599999999998
yeah nicole i agree

2638.64 --> 2642.64
doctors

2639.76 --> 2644.96
have been over prescribing antibiotics

2642.64 --> 2644.96
since

2645.839 --> 2651.68
since early 20th century since

2648.079 --> 2651.6800000000003
antibiotics came on the market

2659.839 --> 2664.88
i mean there are cases in which

2662.319 --> 2667.359
antibiotics can be absolutely great

2664.88 --> 2671.2000000000003
let's just say you risk getting gangrene

2667.359 --> 2673.04
or something right antibiotics oh yeah

2671.2 --> 2674.3999999999996
quickly as possible

2673.04 --> 2677.8
but

2674.4 --> 2680.64
just regular internal

2677.8 --> 2683.3590000000004
inflammations like why

2680.64 --> 2686.4
i mean i have that sort of thing

2683.359 --> 2689.04
well i wouldn't say all the time

2686.4 --> 2691.28
but periodically and i even like

2689.04 --> 2694.319
been open about it here

2691.28 --> 2697.52
like why would you go to a doctor

2694.319 --> 2699.119
and take some like serious ailment cure

2697.52 --> 2702.88
because that's what antibiotics it's

2699.119 --> 2705.359
like it's the big guns really

2702.88 --> 2707.599
for very serious situations why would

2705.359 --> 2709.44
you take that for just like oh sinus

2707.599 --> 2713.319
infection it just

2709.44 --> 2713.319
i don't understand

2718.0 --> 2722.96
that is just overestimating like what it

2720.64 --> 2724.56
is and like oh you're a

2722.96 --> 2727.119
sudden

2724.56 --> 2728.64
super dangerous infection oh really is

2727.119 --> 2730.48
that what happens to everybody

2728.64 --> 2732.64
constantly

2730.48 --> 2734.599
that doesn't seem logical to me

2732.64 --> 2737.7599999999998
in my

2734.599 --> 2740.319
diagnostics is

2737.76 --> 2742.6400000000003
layman's diagnostics

2740.319 --> 2742.64
all right

2745.44 --> 2749.599
all right it's much better to just use

2747.2 --> 2752.0
colloidal silver use oregano oil there

2749.599 --> 2755.28
are so many different of these really

2752.0 --> 2755.28
cheap easy to get

2755.68 --> 2761.24
substances

2757.119 --> 2761.2400000000002
they're all very legal

2761.28 --> 2765.92
everywhere

2762.64 --> 2768.319
that are so much easier to use and so

2765.92 --> 2771.319
less side effects

2768.319 --> 2771.319
right

2784.72 --> 2788.2799999999997
hey moon shadow

2795.68 --> 2798.7999999999997
hopefully oh so you're just gonna do it

2798.0 --> 2801.44
then

2798.8 --> 2803.3590000000004
you're just gonna do it

2801.44 --> 2805.04
no questions asked

2803.359 --> 2807.04
the doctor said it

2805.04 --> 2809.52
you don't understand

2807.04 --> 2812.48
seems overblown but you're just gonna do

2809.52 --> 2815.359
it anyway because the doctor told you

2812.48 --> 2817.599
so i guess that the doctor has

2815.359 --> 2820.88
sovereignty over you

2817.599 --> 2822.8
by your own decision then bad karma

2820.88 --> 2825.839
the doctor says you gotta do something

2822.8 --> 2825.8390000000004
you just do it

2827.52 --> 2833.04
that's worrisome

2829.68 --> 2833.04
especially in this age

2839.68 --> 2843.68
take

2841.48 --> 2845.599
diatomaceous earth

2843.68 --> 2848.0789999999997
never heard of that

2845.599 --> 2852.0
tumeric ginger

2848.079 --> 2852.0
yeah sounds about good sounds good

2857.119 --> 2860.96
all right i use turmeric turmeric is

2859.68 --> 2864.319
fantastic

2860.96 --> 2864.319
i use it in my coffee

2864.88 --> 2869.599
most mostly there

2867.119 --> 2872.88
and yeah some of the supplements i take

2869.599 --> 2874.96
also have turmeric in them

2872.88 --> 2877.6800000000003
this is really good and i have

2874.96 --> 2881.2
specifically like made a warning sign

2877.68 --> 2882.0
for myself like don't overdo it

2881.2 --> 2884.8799999999997
because

2882.0 --> 2887.119
you could i could overdo it it's not

2884.88 --> 2890.0
even that bad it's like it is pretty

2887.119 --> 2892.1600000000003
miraculous substance

2890.0 --> 2894.8
but i'm worried like that i might grow

2892.16 --> 2897.1189999999997
like dependent

2894.8 --> 2898.7200000000003
in some ways on my functioning with it

2897.119 --> 2900.2400000000002
if i overdo it

2898.72 --> 2903.24
i worry about that with a lot of

2900.24 --> 2903.24
substances

2921.52 --> 2925.4
chia seed yeah

2929.52 --> 2933.2
you haven't taken the vaccine despite

2931.359 --> 2937.96
all the propaganda oh well good and you

2933.2 --> 2937.96
bad karma well that's one thing

2945.359 --> 2950.5989999999997
now make sure you

2946.88 --> 2950.599
you stick to that

2975.04 --> 2979.119
oh right i almost forgot

2977.04 --> 2981.119
like oregano oil colloidal silver

2979.119 --> 2985.839
vitamin c man

2981.119 --> 2985.839
if you got any form of inflammation

2987.599 --> 2992.8
and then just think like okay have i

2990.319 --> 2995.52
been taking a lot of vitamin c

2992.8 --> 2998.7200000000003
it's probably going to be a no

2995.52 --> 3000.96
really think about that like everybody

2998.72 --> 3003.68
uses vitamin c every now and then okay

3000.96 --> 3005.599
so when you suddenly arrive one day and

3003.68 --> 3007.44
you have like this really painful

3005.599 --> 3012.2000000000003
inflammation somewhere

3007.44 --> 3012.2000000000003
have you been taking vitamin c

3012.64 --> 3016.24
or

3014.0 --> 3017.359
like have you taken large quantities of

3016.24 --> 3018.4799999999996
it

3017.359 --> 3019.92
any form

3018.48 --> 3022.48
probably not

3019.92 --> 3025.28
because vitamin c is

3022.48 --> 3029.359
like universal

3025.28 --> 3029.3590000000004
against all forms of inflammation

3030.079 --> 3036.0
like it works so well for so many things

3033.76 --> 3039.0
and you can't overdose it it's

3036.0 --> 3039.0
impossible

3040.079 --> 3045.2000000000003
so that would also be

3042.319 --> 3045.2
a good option

3046.24 --> 3050.24
because you if you just realize like oh

3048.24 --> 3052.3999999999996
damn i haven't been taking that and now

3050.24 --> 3055.52
i have an inflammation somewhere yeah

3052.4 --> 3058.319
just start taking it immediately

3055.52 --> 3061.839
like what's stopping you there's no bad

3058.319 --> 3061.839
side effects that can come from that

3064.64 --> 3068.7999999999997
now maybe if you swallow like a whole

3066.559 --> 3070.88
bottle all at once

3068.8 --> 3074.2000000000003
yeah that's overkill but just you know

3070.88 --> 3074.2000000000003
what i mean

3095.52 --> 3100.319
okay pg crew shank that sounds

3097.599 --> 3100.319
problematic

3101.119 --> 3107.1600000000003
what

3102.96 --> 3107.16
i'm trying to understand the context

3110.0 --> 3114.559
are you saying that your wife went to

3112.079 --> 3116.7200000000003
the doctor regularly

3114.559 --> 3119.44
because of basically physical symptoms

3116.72 --> 3121.52
that came from suppressed

3119.44 --> 3123.68
psychological issues because that does

3121.52 --> 3125.28
happen that's like a yeah that happens

3123.68 --> 3128.5589999999997
it's like over stressing and then your

3125.28 --> 3130.559
body just becomes the target for it and

3128.559 --> 3133.2000000000003
you start to get problems to distract

3130.559 --> 3138.2000000000003
you from the psychological tensions

3133.2 --> 3138.2
that actually happens it happened to me

3138.559 --> 3144.0
well yeah during my teens and my as a

3141.04 --> 3145.599
little kid that happened

3144.0 --> 3148.24
just literally i get sick and then

3145.599 --> 3150.6400000000003
they're like whoa what happened

3148.24 --> 3152.7999999999997
and then suddenly out of nowhere like a

3150.64 --> 3154.64
memory would pop up like of something

3152.8 --> 3157.119
that had happened that actually stressed

3154.64 --> 3158.96
me out so much that i just forgot it

3157.119 --> 3160.4
entirely

3158.96 --> 3163.64
weird [ __ ]

3160.4 --> 3163.64
like that

3166.96 --> 3169.359
all right

3174.64 --> 3179.5989999999997
well you want to get into the details it

3176.72 --> 3182.0789999999997
that it is your wife's psychology of

3179.599 --> 3182.079
course but

3185.92 --> 3190.6800000000003
like i hope she's not like gone to the

3188.64 --> 3193.52
root of like oh i have these

3190.68 --> 3196.0
psychological issues or something okay

3193.52 --> 3197.44
i'll just take

3196.0 --> 3200.319
like

3197.44 --> 3202.88
drugs against it

3200.319 --> 3204.88
because that is

3202.88 --> 3208.44
not a good option

3204.88 --> 3208.44
on the long run

3208.8 --> 3213.28
the best thing you can do when you

3211.119 --> 3216.1600000000003
realize you have psychological issues

3213.28 --> 3218.8
especially stress related is that you

3216.16 --> 3220.24
don't run away from it and actually take

3218.8 --> 3222.8
some time

3220.24 --> 3226.0
to deal with it

3222.8 --> 3228.48
to face it yourself to get real with

3226.0 --> 3228.48
yourself

3234.64 --> 3238.7999999999997
but yeah you gotta have some room in

3236.24 --> 3241.1189999999997
your life to do that though

3238.8 --> 3242.96
right if you're like in a super tight

3241.119 --> 3244.96
work schedule that it becomes

3242.96 --> 3249.2400000000002
problematic

3244.96 --> 3249.2400000000002
you don't have the room to do it then

3256.079 --> 3261.0
oh okay

3257.76 --> 3261.0
all right

3265.52 --> 3270.88
okay be a christian so it's your partner

3268.64 --> 3274.5589999999997
although yeah partner does kind of in

3270.88 --> 3274.559
this age sound kind of gay

3275.28 --> 3279.8390000000004
but yeah i get it i get it

3289.2 --> 3293.799
what

3290.4 --> 3293.799
the hell

3297.839 --> 3300.48
yeah

3298.72 --> 3303.52
i'm sorry dude

3300.48 --> 3303.52
that's not gonna

3303.68 --> 3309.16
that's not gonna scroll into my chat

3306.16 --> 3309.16
thanks

3329.359 --> 3332.96
hmm

3330.4 --> 3335.44
okay slow mo moon buggy

3332.96 --> 3338.799
that sounds interesting

3335.44 --> 3338.799
cheap vitamin c i guess

3338.96 --> 3342.2400000000002
yeah well cheap vitamin c

3341.44 --> 3343.2000000000003
is

3342.24 --> 3344.72
yeah

3343.2 --> 3347.1189999999997
it's

3344.72 --> 3349.4399999999996
maybe yeah there could be organic

3347.119 --> 3352.0
variants of it

3349.44 --> 3353.92
directly extracted from certain types of

3352.0 --> 3356.559
plants and all that that would probably

3353.92 --> 3359.04
be better but technically just like the

3356.559 --> 3361.44
laboratory of vitamin c

3359.04 --> 3363.2
works just as great as long as it's not

3361.44 --> 3365.119
polluted

3363.2 --> 3367.1189999999997
and usually isn't

3365.119 --> 3369.359
because it's laboratory made and yeah

3367.119 --> 3369.359
it's

3370.0 --> 3373.72
but it works great

3378.799 --> 3384.0
right all vitamin c

3381.359 --> 3387.839
even artificially main ones work just

3384.0 --> 3387.839
fine as long as they're not polluted

3389.2 --> 3393.96
with other things that shouldn't be in

3390.96 --> 3393.96
there

3412.16 --> 3417.2
right yeah pj kershank it's just that if

3414.64 --> 3418.72
a guy that i don't know yet is gonna

3417.2 --> 3422.0789999999997
like talk

3418.72 --> 3422.8799999999997
about his partner without saying

3422.079 --> 3424.88
like

3422.88 --> 3427.52
woman or anything

3424.88 --> 3430.7200000000003
then i'm always left wondering like okay

3427.52 --> 3430.72
does that mean you're gay

3431.839 --> 3436.24
until they make

3433.68 --> 3440.319
clear through what they tell about their

3436.24 --> 3440.319
partner whether they're a woman or a man

3443.839 --> 3449.88
right but you've talked about the misses

3446.48 --> 3449.88
so i knew

3460.9 --> 3464.039
[Music]

3464.48 --> 3469.28
yeah pg christian laugh it up it's a

3466.799 --> 3470.16
serious issue here in the netherlands

3469.28 --> 3474.2000000000003
like

3470.16 --> 3474.2
there's so many weird

3476.799 --> 3481.52
trans ideas it's not even like they're

3479.92 --> 3484.799
getting surgery or anything but there's

3481.52 --> 3484.799
just so much like

3485.52 --> 3491.119
that [ __ ] going around and pc and like a

3488.48 --> 3494.319
lot of people just do say partner here

3491.119 --> 3495.92
and it's actually kind of annoying

3494.319 --> 3497.7599999999998
because what i just said like yeah you

3495.92 --> 3499.44
never really know whether they're gay

3497.76 --> 3502.0
when they talk about their partner yeah

3499.44 --> 3504.7200000000003
that's actually a legitimate issue for

3502.0 --> 3508.079
me out here

3504.72 --> 3508.0789999999997
because you really don't know

3508.64 --> 3513.2799999999997
because a lot of these guys out here are

3510.88 --> 3516.079
gay or they're just acting gay it's

3513.28 --> 3519.6800000000003
terrible

3516.079 --> 3519.6800000000003
i might be overblowing a little bit

3520.079 --> 3522.319
uh

3525.28 --> 3528.559
right anyway what were we talking about

3527.2 --> 3533.839
again

3528.559 --> 3533.8390000000004
oh yeah inflammation bad karma

3534.64 --> 3538.319
and then

3536.24 --> 3540.8799999999997
psychosomatic

3538.319 --> 3544.2799999999997
issues with your

3540.88 --> 3544.28
lady friend

3569.44 --> 3574.559
right it's also owen benjamin's fault

3571.92 --> 3575.76
he's the first one to talk about that

3574.559 --> 3579.079
partner

3575.76 --> 3579.079
my partner

3588.88 --> 3592.319
fail

3590.0 --> 3595.64
aries

3592.319 --> 3595.64
the [ __ ]

3604.4 --> 3609.6800000000003
what what do i think it is this is

3606.72 --> 3611.9199999999996
really weird to talk about that but

3609.68 --> 3611.9199999999996
uh

3613.119 --> 3619.04
it's basically a choice of

3615.04 --> 3620.799
interpretation of your impulses

3619.04 --> 3622.079
right

3620.799 --> 3623.04
because

3622.079 --> 3625.44
guys

3623.04 --> 3628.319
especially ones that have rich emotion

3625.44 --> 3631.2000000000003
lives and all that sensitivities you can

3628.319 --> 3633.359
get like a man crush on another guy

3631.2 --> 3636.24
but it's not sexual

3633.359 --> 3638.16
it's just like whoa

3636.24 --> 3639.2
it's really awesome it makes you feel

3638.16 --> 3642.5989999999997
like oh

3639.2 --> 3642.5989999999997
i want to be

3642.88 --> 3647.28
like yeah

3644.88 --> 3649.76
around them and just hear them out learn

3647.28 --> 3651.0400000000004
from them and like help them and yeah

3649.76 --> 3652.6400000000003
this just

3651.04 --> 3655.2799999999997
and

3652.64 --> 3657.5989999999997
if you then misinterpret that and take

3655.28 --> 3660.96
that further

3657.599 --> 3660.96
then it becomes gay

3661.599 --> 3665.6400000000003
that's basically it

3670.88 --> 3674.88
it's really

3672.16 --> 3677.839
yeah just crossing these lines and then

3674.88 --> 3681.2400000000002
accepting that to be the norm

3677.839 --> 3681.24
that's it

3684.079 --> 3689.52
and it is a choice

3687.119 --> 3692.48
it's a choice to have that line be

3689.52 --> 3694.72
crossed and then go there

3692.48 --> 3696.559
and then maybe if you go there you kind

3694.72 --> 3698.0
of like it and then you really have a

3696.559 --> 3701.0400000000004
problem because now you're not going to

3698.0 --> 3703.2
uncross that line anymore

3701.04 --> 3704.799
right because just because you think you

3703.2 --> 3706.3999999999996
like something doesn't mean it's the

3704.799 --> 3707.839
right thing right

3706.4 --> 3710.319
because that's the same thing that

3707.839 --> 3713.44
people that use heroin say too it's like

3710.319 --> 3716.16
yeah but i really like it yeah

3713.44 --> 3718.96
that's the problem

3716.16 --> 3721.2
don't do it don't go there just never go

3718.96 --> 3721.2
there

3724.24 --> 3729.1189999999997
ew

3727.039 --> 3732.6800000000003
that's a gay

god

3746.48 --> 3749.44
it's all

3748.16 --> 3751.359
ill

3749.44 --> 3753.839
no no no

3751.359 --> 3757.119
when i have sex with somebody it's with

3753.839 --> 3758.4
their spirit it's with their energy i

3757.119 --> 3760.2400000000002
i like

3758.4 --> 3762.559
female energy

3760.24 --> 3764.16
especially certain frequencies it draws

3762.559 --> 3766.88
me in

3764.16 --> 3769.839
it's really their energy body

3766.88 --> 3772.1600000000003
right that's the thing that really

3769.839 --> 3773.68
does it for me

3772.16 --> 3774.5589999999997
it's not about

3773.68 --> 3777.359
like

3774.559 --> 3778.96
the physical mechanics even

3777.359 --> 3781.5989999999997
it's about what they're feeling what

3778.96 --> 3783.359
they're radiating that's the thing that

3781.599 --> 3785.039
does it for me

3783.359 --> 3788.24
it's not like oh

3785.039 --> 3790.1600000000003
a mouth like oh yeah yeah that that's

3788.24 --> 3792.3999999999996
there's other groups of people that also

3790.16 --> 3794.319
think like that you know what they are

3792.4 --> 3796.4
the ones that get blow-up dolls there

3794.319 --> 3798.64
it's all the same to them you know it's

3796.4 --> 3798.64
just

3798.72 --> 3802.24
a certain shape

3800.559 --> 3803.8390000000004
and that apparently is good enough for

3802.24 --> 3805.839
them well guess what

3803.839 --> 3808.88
doesn't really do it for me

3805.839 --> 3813.839
and i happen to not really like male

3808.88 --> 3813.839
energy i like really don't like it

3814.72 --> 3818.16
i mean

3816.0 --> 3822.839
what is it now god

3818.16 --> 3826.8799999999997
two decades ago like i kissed a guy once

3822.839 --> 3829.839
it literally almost made me throw up

3826.88 --> 3833.2000000000003
like i really don't like that energy i

3829.839 --> 3834.4
really really don't oh

3833.2 --> 3836.8799999999997
this is

3834.4 --> 3838.799
i guess i had to get empirical to be

3836.88 --> 3841.28
sure

3838.799 --> 3844.0
but after that point it was like

3841.28 --> 3846.1600000000003
like after that point

3844.0 --> 3848.16
like i really

3846.16 --> 3850.24
didn't want to be associated with that

3848.16 --> 3852.5589999999997
anymore because before that i had no

3850.24 --> 3854.9599999999996
idea and i was like yeah oh gay is all

3852.559 --> 3858.0
popular and oh if you just i was kind of

3854.96 --> 3859.839
being like a stupid liberal kid

3858.0 --> 3861.52
it's like oh yeah

3859.839 --> 3863.2
if you say you're gay then suddenly

3861.52 --> 3864.839
you're cool or something it was really

3863.2 --> 3868.0
that cheap

3864.839 --> 3869.599
that ugh so this makes me feel so

3868.0 --> 3871.599
disgusting now

3869.599 --> 3873.92
i was never really like oh i'm good i'm

3871.599 --> 3875.6800000000003
good never never

3873.92 --> 3877.6800000000003
never do that

3875.68 --> 3878.839
but i was like oh yeah sure i'll call

3877.68 --> 3881.839
myself gay

3878.839 --> 3883.2799999999997
whatever if you guys think that's cool i

3881.839 --> 3885.44
didn't care i didn't really know what

3883.28 --> 3888.1600000000003
that was

3885.44 --> 3890.16
until i well kissed the guy and then i

3888.16 --> 3892.5589999999997
really found out like oh my god is that

3890.16 --> 3894.8799999999997
what this is ew

3892.559 --> 3898.559
ew no

3894.88 --> 3898.559
i don't even want to know the rest

3899.599 --> 3901.92
ugh

3902.48 --> 3905.48
yeah

3910.48 --> 3914.16
but yeah i have like

3913.119 --> 3916.319
known

3914.16 --> 3918.16
gay men

3916.319 --> 3920.72
like friends of my mother

3918.16 --> 3922.8799999999997
was one guy was kind of gay well kind he

3920.72 --> 3925.5989999999997
was like a flaming homosexual but he

3922.88 --> 3927.839
wasn't like a nancy like it

3925.599 --> 3929.52
like he wasn't like constantly

3927.839 --> 3931.44
hopping around like a fruitcake or

3929.52 --> 3933.68
something but he was very gay and i

3931.44 --> 3934.48
thought that that guy was awesome

3933.68 --> 3937.0389999999998
because

3934.48 --> 3939.68
he had a rich

3937.039 --> 3942.1600000000003
internal life and a big mind and we

3939.68 --> 3944.72
would have a lot of conversations

3942.16 --> 3946.64
i was never physically attracted to him

3944.72 --> 3948.72
at all i think he might have been a

3946.64 --> 3953.0389999999998
little bit towards me but he was very

3948.72 --> 3953.0389999999998
respectful very respectful

3953.68 --> 3958.24
he never like made a move or anything

3956.799 --> 3960.88
they have good memories of that and he

3958.24 --> 3963.1189999999997
was well as gay as it gets pretty much

3960.88 --> 3965.2000000000003
so i don't have any issues with gays

3963.119 --> 3967.92
really it's about that

3965.2 --> 3968.64
the ones that really want you to be gay

3967.92 --> 3971.52
too

3968.64 --> 3973.0389999999998
they want to just get in you ugh

3971.52 --> 3975.68
disgusting

3973.039 --> 3977.3590000000004
it's really disgusting to me

3975.68 --> 3981.1189999999997
and i don't like it when women do it

3977.359 --> 3981.119
either like when they're too pushy

3983.359 --> 3987.44
like when they don't know you and

3985.119 --> 3989.2000000000003
they're too pushy like hey if you're

3987.44 --> 3990.799
if you're really into one another you're

3989.2 --> 3994.48
in a relationship and they get like that

3990.799 --> 3994.48
yeah okay you know

3998.64 --> 4002.5589999999997
it's like kind of gay not to give in to

4000.72 --> 4004.8799999999997
that then when you're actually properly

4002.559 --> 4006.799
in a relationship but

4004.88 --> 4008.7200000000003
when you don't know each other you

4006.799 --> 4010.319
shouldn't have that you shouldn't have

4008.72 --> 4014.3999999999996
those impulses like that you shouldn't

4010.319 --> 4014.4
give in to that like that's gay

4014.48 --> 4019.72
[ __ ]

4016.72 --> 4019.72
ish

4025.2 --> 4030.0
yeah the touchy feel yeah

4027.52 --> 4030.0
i know

4030.24 --> 4034.4399999999996
yeah i don't really like that either

4046.319 --> 4049.839
oh my god

4058.0 --> 4064.0
all right

4059.359 --> 4065.44
yeah pj kirshak yeah oh god it should

4064.0 --> 4067.839
come to this

4065.44 --> 4069.52
so it is really sodom all over again

4067.839 --> 4072.48
isn't it

4069.52 --> 4075.48
it really is that

4072.48 --> 4075.48
ugh

4083.359 --> 4088.319
a really funny gay dude from ace died

4085.44 --> 4091.839
from azt yeah

4088.319 --> 4091.839
dude that's freaking fouchy

4095.52 --> 4101.679
fauci killed like a whole bunch of 70s

4098.08 --> 4103.44
and 80s gays with his treatment

4101.679 --> 4105.839
that was actually the thing that killed

4103.44 --> 4105.839
them

4132.64 --> 4135.64
hmm

4157.839 --> 4160.839
yep

4162.88 --> 4167.759
well he wasn't just in on that scam he

4165.44 --> 4170.879999999999
literally was the

4167.759 --> 4170.88
the creator of it

4171.679 --> 4174.679
right

4174.719 --> 4178.359
it was his drug

4204.64 --> 4208.8
are they born like that in my no but

4206.719 --> 4209.92
i've already said i answered that

4208.8 --> 4212.2390000000005
question

4209.92 --> 4215.1990000000005
no they're not born like that but you

4212.239 --> 4218.159
might have some of the impulses it is as

4215.199 --> 4221.199
i said it's just like wow

4218.159 --> 4224.639999999999
being really impressed by a guy

4221.199 --> 4226.879999999999
and being able to imagine like how a guy

4224.64 --> 4228.400000000001
could be attractive to a woman

4226.88 --> 4230.32
right

4228.4 --> 4232.719
well that's

4230.32 --> 4235.599999999999
kind of normal it's just that if you

4232.719 --> 4237.12
then start to become that woman in that

4235.6 --> 4241.1990000000005
imagination

4237.12 --> 4241.199
that's when things get really disgusting

4243.12 --> 4247.84
you see

4245.679 --> 4253.159
and just like constantly thinking about

4247.84 --> 4253.159000000001
sex is kind of gay but just by itself

4258.48 --> 4262.239
like should just not be thinking about

4260.4 --> 4264.239
that should be

4262.239 --> 4267.28
figuring out like hey what is their

4264.239 --> 4270.08
personality what are they good at

4267.28 --> 4272.719
like what must be their own obstacles

4270.08 --> 4274.8
and complications they deal with in life

4272.719 --> 4276.719
that is a more sensible thing to focus

4274.8 --> 4280.56
on not like oh

4276.719 --> 4280.56
oh i wonder how he would squirt

4281.04 --> 4284.04
yuck

4287.0 --> 4290.199
[Music]

4290.239 --> 4296.639999999999
oh jerome horowitz invented it okay okay

4294.0 --> 4299.04
it wasn't fiji himself but he was that

4296.64 --> 4302.96
he was still involved in it though

4299.04 --> 4302.96
then i got that wrong i guess

4305.199 --> 4309.199
am i anti-gay then

4307.44 --> 4312.08
oh

4309.199 --> 4315.839999999999
is that the conclusion you're gonna draw

4312.08 --> 4315.84
from everything that i talked about

4320.96 --> 4329.12
no i'm not anti-gay i am not obsessed

4324.56 --> 4330.8
with oh i want my world to not have kids

4329.12 --> 4332.4
no

4330.8 --> 4334.400000000001
well i preferred not

4332.4 --> 4336.5599999999995
of yeah like

4334.4 --> 4338.48
cut it down you know i don't want every

4336.56 --> 4341.04
freaking man in the world to be gay

4338.48 --> 4344.48
around like that's horrific

4341.04 --> 4344.48
don't mind a couple of them

4345.36 --> 4347.5199999999995
but i am

4346.8 --> 4350.4800000000005
in

4347.52 --> 4352.080000000001
my own way a kind of homophobic like

4350.48 --> 4355.44
actually

4352.08 --> 4358.88
like it does creep me out

4355.44 --> 4358.879999999999
it really creeps me out

4363.28 --> 4368.88
like i guess some people

4365.52 --> 4372.159000000001
are like super terrified of spiders

4368.88 --> 4374.719
right for just a very familiar phobia

4372.159 --> 4376.0
yeah with me like really flaming gay

4374.719 --> 4379.52
people i

4376.0 --> 4382.8
i i get nervous i i get like

4379.52 --> 4382.8
like this is great yeah

4382.96 --> 4388.32
this yeah so

4385.28 --> 4390.239
i don't like it and i don't like people

4388.32 --> 4392.5599999999995
like

4390.239 --> 4396.599999999999
doing that

4392.56 --> 4396.6
i think it's a really disruptive

4400.8 --> 4403.12
dude

4404.0 --> 4408.48
that's you are disgusting i'm gonna

4409.52 --> 4413.8
i think i'm gonna kick you out

4419.92 --> 4423.92
definitely i'm gonna remove that just

4422.56 --> 4427.84
no

4423.92 --> 4432.679
nobody needs more gays

4427.84 --> 4432.679
there's plenty around already

4447.6 --> 4452.1990000000005
wasn't the choice he made oh really

4459.239 --> 4465.919999999999
overpopulation ah

4462.88 --> 4470.12
why'd you start with yourself

4465.92 --> 4470.12
how do you even know it's overpopulation

4470.56 --> 4473.280000000001
what is that

4473.84 --> 4479.360000000001
what is overpopulated what do you base

4477.04 --> 4480.88
the over

4479.36 --> 4482.799999999999
element on

4480.88 --> 4487.0
what do you base that on what are your

4482.8 --> 4487.0
sources to come to that conclusion

4500.719 --> 4504.159
sister is gay okay

4506.56 --> 4512.8
well you know how women also get gay

4510.64 --> 4516.400000000001
by being surrounded by completely

4512.8 --> 4516.400000000001
unreliable [ __ ] men

4516.719 --> 4522.88
and men that abuse them not necessarily

4520.08 --> 4522.88
the same people

4523.679 --> 4530.4
right then they're just like no i'm just

4526.0 --> 4530.4
not connecting to that side anymore

4535.199 --> 4540.159
the population will sort itself out well

4537.44 --> 4541.599999999999
yeah if you're just

4540.159 --> 4543.839999999999
letting everybody

4541.6 --> 4548.4400000000005
be gay

4543.84 --> 4548.4400000000005
yeah then it's gonna sort itself out

4573.84 --> 4578.8
that's right return to normal

4576.8 --> 4580.96
yeah if you get indoctrinated by that

4578.8 --> 4582.8
[ __ ] shit's like oh yeah

4580.96 --> 4585.28
oh my

4582.8 --> 4587.679
little brother or sister or whatever is

4585.28 --> 4591.12
like trans with the operation and all

4587.679 --> 4594.08
like he knew he was like oh really

4591.12 --> 4596.239
he knew that as a kid did he

4594.08 --> 4599.36
like how did he know that could it be

4596.239 --> 4601.44
because everybody was green lighting it

4599.36 --> 4604.32
and being like yay

4601.44 --> 4606.48
come on do whatever impulse like oh you

4604.32 --> 4608.5599999999995
want to be that oh do that

4606.48 --> 4611.04
without any

4608.56 --> 4612.719
responsibility or oversight down to the

4611.04 --> 4615.12
future what that's actually going to do

4612.719 --> 4615.12
to them

4618.88 --> 4622.2390000000005
so

4619.679 --> 4624.64
no it is a choice but yeah if you are

4622.239 --> 4626.5599999999995
literally like in the middle of a gay

4624.64 --> 4628.159000000001
family nest or whatever yeah what you

4626.56 --> 4630.719
think is gonna happen you're not

4628.159 --> 4632.5599999999995
necessarily like you don't automatically

4630.719 --> 4635.76
become gay that way by the way if you're

4632.56 --> 4637.76
just not gay you're not gay some guys

4635.76 --> 4639.360000000001
are really just not gay it doesn't

4637.76 --> 4641.6
matter how many gays you surround them

4639.36 --> 4643.839999999999
but they're not gonna become gay

4641.6 --> 4643.84
right

4644.96 --> 4649.04
but hey if you have any

4647.36 --> 4651.92
sort of like

4649.04 --> 4653.12
impulses in that direction any sort of

4651.92 --> 4654.88
thing

4653.12 --> 4657.5199999999995
and you're surrounded by it yeah it's

4654.88 --> 4660.2390000000005
very likely you're gonna feel very green

4657.52 --> 4662.64
light it's very okay to choose that and

4660.239 --> 4665.639999999999
then you choose that and then you become

4662.64 --> 4665.64
that

4681.92 --> 4686.719
you don't understand physiology at all

4689.92 --> 4694.2390000000005
wow

4691.52 --> 4695.6
no that's a physiological response

4694.239 --> 4698.159
actually

4695.6 --> 4701.76
that's not natural

4698.159 --> 4703.36
that's a physical hormonal response to a

4701.76 --> 4704.320000000001
psychological

4703.36 --> 4706.639999999999
setting

4704.32 --> 4708.96
actually right

4706.64 --> 4710.8
when a woman starts to produce male

4708.96 --> 4714.08
hormones

4710.8 --> 4717.84
come like that it's because the males

4714.08 --> 4717.84
around them are lacking

4718.0 --> 4721.719
did you know that

4723.199 --> 4727.599999999999
because they feel undefended on a

4725.92 --> 4728.88
physical level

4727.6 --> 4730.96
it's like they're surrounded by

4728.88 --> 4733.36
weaklings that could never in a serious

4730.96 --> 4736.4
situation defend them so they then have

4733.36 --> 4736.4
to take it over

4737.52 --> 4742.2390000000005
it happens to some single mothers too

4740.64 --> 4743.280000000001
because they just

4742.239 --> 4745.919999999999
they don't

4743.28 --> 4748.639999999999
have reliable men they're too many

4745.92 --> 4750.56
unreliable men and they just

4748.64 --> 4752.4800000000005
they just do it themselves

4750.56 --> 4755.280000000001
i have no clue what i'm talking about oh

4752.48 --> 4757.44
sure i don't yeah yeah yeah i don't know

4755.28 --> 4759.84
what i'm talking about

4757.44 --> 4762.08
you do because you think you're just

4759.84 --> 4764.719
born gay

4762.08 --> 4768.08
just automatically become a gay

4764.719 --> 4768.08
just like that without any

4774.84 --> 4778.2390000000005
suggestions dude

4778.96 --> 4783.36
an isolated human being that has never

4781.84 --> 4786.2390000000005
even

4783.36 --> 4789.599999999999
seen heard or smelled anything

4786.239 --> 4792.0
associating to sex or social sexual

4789.6 --> 4794.56
interaction in any way

4792.0 --> 4797.28
they're literally not going to even know

4794.56 --> 4799.76
what that is

4797.28 --> 4799.759999999999
it's all

4800.719 --> 4803.199
teaching

4801.84 --> 4805.6
all

4803.199 --> 4808.159
like showing you what that is and then

4805.6 --> 4809.1990000000005
you think it's okay and then you adapt

4808.159 --> 4810.4
to that

4809.199 --> 4814.08
right

4810.4 --> 4814.08
gay doesn't come natural

4816.48 --> 4823.36
like sexual behavior

4820.4 --> 4826.5599999999995
sexual social interaction doesn't really

4823.36 --> 4828.48
come that natural i mean eventually it

4826.56 --> 4831.04
might like

4828.48 --> 4834.0
yeah if you never knew what sex was and

4831.04 --> 4836.08
you meet a female that's the same

4834.0 --> 4838.239
then eventually like nature might

4836.08 --> 4839.679
completely take over

4838.239 --> 4841.36
right

4839.679 --> 4843.52
but it's not going to be the first thing

4841.36 --> 4846.0
on their mind because they've never seen

4843.52 --> 4849.8
or heard anything about that because

4846.0 --> 4849.8
it's taught behavior

4862.0 --> 4865.84
uh race cursor i don't wanna know about

4864.239 --> 4867.36
that

4865.84 --> 4871.159000000001
it's disgusting

4867.36 --> 4871.159
yeah it is double zap

4874.96 --> 4880.08
but yeah once you choose that it's very

4877.6 --> 4882.71
easy to just say i

4880.08 --> 4885.36
i couldn't help it i was born this way

4882.71 --> 4886.32
[Music]

4885.36 --> 4887.839999999999
yeah

4886.32 --> 4892.159
there's a whole bunch of people in a

4887.84 --> 4894.159000000001
whole bunch of places that also say that

4892.159 --> 4896.638999999999
like some of them are

4894.159 --> 4898.719
like part of the new world order they

4896.639 --> 4900.88
say that too like yeah i was just born

4898.719 --> 4903.12
in this family like what can you do you

4900.88 --> 4906.12
know

4903.12 --> 4906.12
yeah

4924.48 --> 4928.239
god slow mo moon buggy yeah

4929.36 --> 4934.199
i've heard those types of stories too

4946.4 --> 4950.879999999999
same sex coupling

4950.0 --> 4952.719
no

4950.88 --> 4955.76
no no no

4952.719 --> 4958.32
rape maybe bad karma yeah

4955.76 --> 4960.88
that's not coupling

4958.32 --> 4963.199
right they don't form couples

4960.88 --> 4964.96
they might have sex with some

4963.199 --> 4966.32
yeah they might get really horny or

4964.96 --> 4968.32
whatever

4966.32 --> 4971.5199999999995
it's not coupling what are you talking

4968.32 --> 4973.84
about never heard of that before

4971.52 --> 4976.96
right coupling is already pretty rare in

4973.84 --> 4976.96
nature to begin with

4977.84 --> 4981.6
like swans couple

4980.159 --> 4983.28
for life

4981.6 --> 4986.320000000001
there's probably some other animals that

4983.28 --> 4990.0
do that same sex coupling that sounds

4986.32 --> 4990.0
like complete hogwash

4991.6 --> 4997.2390000000005
that's

4993.52 --> 4997.2390000000005
you made that up

5005.28 --> 5010.96
asserting dominance yeah maybe

5009.12 --> 5015.84
but that's not the same thing it's not

5010.96 --> 5015.84
like a romantic relationship oh oops

5017.52 --> 5021.040000000001
disgusting primitive oh well hey how

5020.0 --> 5023.199
about just

5021.04 --> 5026.88
getting banned disgusting yeah i am

5023.199 --> 5029.5199999999995
homophobic and you are gay and you suck

5026.88 --> 5032.4800000000005
everything you do sucks

5029.52 --> 5035.360000000001
you suck in your globe retardation and

5032.48 --> 5038.919999999999
you suck in this too so you just suck

5035.36 --> 5038.92
and now you're banned

5057.84 --> 5062.96
didn't make it oh really so

5060.719 --> 5065.12
where's where's the evidence tell me

5062.96 --> 5069.8
about this couple

5065.12 --> 5069.8
this gay couple in nature

5105.6 --> 5110.639
oh well that's so specific there bad

5108.08 --> 5115.04
karma that's great

5110.639 --> 5118.56
several studies making the connection

5115.04 --> 5118.56
it's so specific man

5120.0 --> 5122.239
i mean that's

5121.36 --> 5124.96
like

5122.239 --> 5127.44
almost a perfect clear-cut example of

5124.96 --> 5131.96
exactly what you're talking about

5127.44 --> 5131.96
and i'm being sarcastic right now

5140.12 --> 5143.229
[Music]

5145.26 --> 5148.97
[Music]

5153.44 --> 5159.199
and hey animals do know romance

5157.52 --> 5161.84
right

5159.199 --> 5165.12
it's not just ooh dominate no it they

5161.84 --> 5167.360000000001
know romance like i see crows here i've

5165.12 --> 5170.719
seen them like all summer

5167.36 --> 5174.159
they get romantic they like really do

5170.719 --> 5176.0
like you i know that that is what it is

5174.159 --> 5177.36
because they get like

5176.0 --> 5180.4
really

5177.36 --> 5182.48
really carefully stroking the others

5180.4 --> 5185.759999999999
feathers like in

5182.48 --> 5188.159
in their heads and like they like are so

5185.76 --> 5191.360000000001
careful like that's romance that's

5188.159 --> 5194.4
actually romantic interaction

5191.36 --> 5198.08
in an animal species

5194.4 --> 5201.28
i bet you that the ghee

5198.08 --> 5201.28
ones don't do that

5209.44 --> 5213.919999999999
yeah pj crew shank

5211.52 --> 5213.92
they do

5216.0 --> 5219.0
okay

5224.4 --> 5226.638999999999
no

5227.6 --> 5234.04
no you're gay

5230.159 --> 5234.04
and now you're in a timeout

5243.44 --> 5246.44
um

5254.639 --> 5258.08
and pigeons

5256.719 --> 5260.88
what

5258.08 --> 5264.159
pigeons do they

5260.88 --> 5264.159000000001
they made for life really

5264.56 --> 5268.159000000001
i didn't know that never heard of that

5268.56 --> 5276.6
i mean pigeons do kind of flock together

5272.239 --> 5276.599999999999
but like as a couple

5292.239 --> 5295.239
huh

5300.08 --> 5304.6
whales yeah yeah i did know about that

5311.04 --> 5313.679
ducks too

5320.239 --> 5323.239
hmm

5328.0 --> 5333.12
okay so it's more animals than i took

5330.159 --> 5333.12
for granted i guess

5335.04 --> 5339.44
i bet they don't do gay coupling though

5340.719 --> 5345.12
pandas don't mate for life well it's

5343.199 --> 5346.5599999999995
arguable whether they

5345.12 --> 5349.719
mate at all

5346.56 --> 5349.719
this is

5357.6 --> 5361.04
ducks are opportunist rapists yeah

5359.6 --> 5364.96
that's what i've seen well that's when

5361.04 --> 5366.88
you feed them red you shouldn't do that

5364.96 --> 5369.88
it kind of makes the female ducks

5366.88 --> 5369.88
unhappy

5394.0 --> 5398.239
so what

5396.239 --> 5399.5199999999995
you're getting there getting back there

5398.239 --> 5401.599999999999
again

5399.52 --> 5404.84
no i'm not i'm talking about animals

5401.6 --> 5404.84
right now

5407.76 --> 5412.4800000000005
i mean

5408.8 --> 5414.159000000001
have i talked about any specific gay man

5412.48 --> 5415.12
here

5414.159 --> 5416.239
at all

5415.12 --> 5420.96
no

5416.239 --> 5422.159
i mentioned a person i knew from my past

5420.96 --> 5424.719
that's

5422.159 --> 5424.719
that's it

5426.0 --> 5429.76
i don't like talking about

5432.84 --> 5437.04
him and they don't like that i don't

5435.199 --> 5441.48
like talking about them because gays

5437.04 --> 5441.48
want to be talked about all the time

5450.48 --> 5456.0
i just want to provoke people's thinking

5454.159 --> 5458.239
i don't like being talked about all the

5456.0 --> 5458.239
time

5461.28 --> 5465.44
i just want to get people thinking i

5463.12 --> 5465.44
want to

5465.679 --> 5470.32
see the proof that they get

5468.0 --> 5472.719
what i talk about that they understand

5470.32 --> 5475.199
what i've tried to communicate

5472.719 --> 5477.28
because that would provide me with

5475.199 --> 5479.04
evidence that i'm actually doing

5477.28 --> 5481.5199999999995
something useful

5479.04 --> 5484.0
that it's working

5481.52 --> 5485.6
that i'm not just completely superfluous

5484.0 --> 5487.92
which is like a

5485.6 --> 5490.639
bit of a

5487.92 --> 5493.28
haunting sensation for me sometimes

5490.639 --> 5495.52
because i do sometimes feel like i'm

5493.28 --> 5499.4
completely superfluous in this world

5495.52 --> 5499.400000000001
it's not true though

5509.76 --> 5512.76
what

5519.679 --> 5522.679
okay

5545.04 --> 5549.12
hit us with a decent tub why i only got

5547.679 --> 5550.719
five more minutes

5549.12 --> 5552.5599999999995
until i'm gonna round out the show i

5550.719 --> 5554.159
think that this show is just kind of gay

5552.56 --> 5557.56
today

5554.159 --> 5557.5599999999995
can't be helped

5576.56 --> 5581.6
yeah i agree with you matthew hall that

5578.88 --> 5583.4400000000005
that's what my case was and then kind of

5581.6 --> 5586.400000000001
got ignored but yeah i totally think

5583.44 --> 5589.04
you're you call it there

5586.4 --> 5591.36
it's just dominance it's like prison

5589.04 --> 5591.36
[ __ ]

5594.32 --> 5600.599999999999
there's there's no love involved in that

5597.04 --> 5600.6
it's just dominance

5608.56 --> 5616.639
and the choice yeah that's right

5610.88 --> 5618.88
yeah it is it's a choice it's a choice

5616.639 --> 5621.84
and you can choose to tell yourself you

5618.88 --> 5621.84
were born with it

5622.32 --> 5624.96
but

5623.199 --> 5627.839999999999
it is a choice

5624.96 --> 5627.84
every single time

5628.639 --> 5636.36
every moment it's a choice

5632.159 --> 5636.36
the choice doesn't go away

5657.6 --> 5662.56
yeah i know aries ducks are pretty

5660.08 --> 5667.239
bizarre

5662.56 --> 5667.2390000000005
and not very nice to their own

5675.199 --> 5679.839999999999
gangsta ducks this is right

5683.6 --> 5689.52
no yeah no you're wrong cps

5686.56 --> 5691.76
yeah the choice to act on it is the

5689.52 --> 5694.159000000001
choice to be gay because it's the action

5691.76 --> 5694.96
that makes you gay

5694.159 --> 5697.599999999999
not

5694.96 --> 5701.119
not the feelings not the thoughts

5697.6 --> 5703.76
we're all seduced by weird feelings and

5701.119 --> 5707.199
thoughts at times just by the sheer

5703.76 --> 5711.4400000000005
confrontation of those awkward and out

5707.199 --> 5713.28
of place and bad things it seduces us

5711.44 --> 5717.36
it echoes in our minds

5713.28 --> 5719.759999999999
right it's the action onto the thought

5717.36 --> 5722.4
that would potentially make you gay so

5719.76 --> 5724.2390000000005
yes it's a choice every single time i'm

5722.4 --> 5726.638999999999
standing by what i said it's not a

5724.239 --> 5728.879999999999
random conclusion i drew

5726.639 --> 5732.28
something i thought about very carefully

5728.88 --> 5732.28
it's a choice

5758.639 --> 5762.4800000000005
yeah thanks return to no i'm with that

5760.56 --> 5765.360000000001
i'm gonna round out the show that can't

5762.48 --> 5767.119
find any better way to
