169.44 --> 177.0
it all right so yeah it's

172.84 --> 177.0
nice unexpected sunny

178.76 --> 181.76
Monday

183.08 --> 188.59900000000002
right it is Monday the 12th of February

190.24 --> 195.28
[Music]

192.519 --> 200.239
2024 temperature is not going to be that

195.28 --> 200.239
much high or anything 9° C

202.799 --> 208.68
yep suniness

205.2 --> 211.159
and tomorrow too it says

208.68 --> 212.13
woohoo

211.159 --> 233.16899999999998
that's

212.13 --> 233.16899999999998
[Music]

234.959 --> 240.2
nice right yeah I was watching I'm a bit

238.2 --> 242.959
late because I was watching Paul Cook

240.2 --> 245.79899999999998
stream who was also streaming was just

242.959 --> 247.159
talking about food and all that and was

245.799 --> 251.12
kind of

247.159 --> 251.12
interesting bit weird here and

251.88 --> 259.04
[Music]

256.359 --> 263.08
there that's some opinions that I'm not

259.04 --> 266.32
entirely sure of and he also misread my

263.08 --> 266.32
chats my

266.88 --> 274.479
communications cuz he was claiming that

269.639 --> 274.479
certain vegetables have like are never

275.4 --> 282.479
good and then like they contain

277.919 --> 285.479
chemicals including like broccoli and

282.479 --> 288.08
that that creates kind all kinds of

285.479 --> 291.28
problems but I would have to disagree

288.08 --> 293.19899999999996
because when you cook it it doesn't give

291.28 --> 295.55999999999995
that those

293.199 --> 297.44
reactions but he didn't read it he

295.56 --> 300.16
didn't read it

297.44 --> 302.36
right so yeah like

300.16 --> 304.72
I definitely don't have those issues

302.36 --> 307.36
with those vegetables when you properly

304.72 --> 310.16
cook them

307.36 --> 312.039
right but yeah if you're like vegan and

310.16 --> 314.96000000000004
you think that everything raw is good

312.039 --> 314.96
then you're going to have a

317.039 --> 321.44
problem your heard salt is not good for

319.44 --> 323.919
the body

321.44 --> 327.08
well yeah

323.919 --> 328.479
I it all depends on what salt doons

327.08 --> 329.72999999999996
first in

328.479 --> 332.87899999999996
Chad

329.73 --> 332.879
[Music]

333.6 --> 338.98
hello

335.319 --> 341.88
like I love certain

338.98 --> 344.8
[Music]

341.88 --> 350.919
salts but if you like take General

344.8 --> 350.919
refined salt table salt yeah that's not

352.12 --> 357.039
good

353.919 --> 360.35999999999996
so but I mean when I eat that I'd feel

357.039 --> 362.44
it I'd feel like ooh this is not good

360.36 --> 365.88
this is a burden on

362.44 --> 367.96
my on my arteries like that's literally

365.88 --> 372.08
what that starts to feel like like this

367.96 --> 375.56
is not healthy but when I eat like lacro

372.08 --> 377.44
Sal it's a very specific type of salt

375.56 --> 380.199
like I don't get that

377.44 --> 382.88
issue I eventually get it if I just keep

380.199 --> 387.12
chugging it but in general I

382.88 --> 388.4
don't so that type of salt is like

387.12 --> 391.4
better for

388.4 --> 391.4
me

399.599 --> 405.71999999999997
right right and it's weird because for

403.319 --> 409.28000000000003
example my grandma used to be like

405.72 --> 411.59900000000005
completely crazy about salt loved it and

409.28 --> 413.79999999999995
would like pour a layer of salt like on

411.599 --> 416.199
her food which is like really repulsive

413.8 --> 418.40000000000003
to looks like literally you'd see the

416.199 --> 420.56
crystal layer of salt on there like oh

418.4 --> 423.71999999999997
my God grandma what are you

420.56 --> 426.4
doing but it's very logical in a way

423.72 --> 431.319
that she would be doing that

426.4 --> 434.23999999999995
because because of table salt used to

431.319 --> 438.03900000000004
have like iodine

434.24 --> 441.08
always so it's like salt she was really

438.039 --> 441.08
trying to get to the

441.759 --> 448.12
iodine in

443.68 --> 450.24
retrospect and we did use iodized table

448.12 --> 453.639
salt like in the f like it was still

450.24 --> 456.8
regular dirty salt but it we did have

453.639 --> 456.8
the one with iodine in

458.72 --> 467.08000000000004
it which is better than when it isn't in

462.16 --> 467.08000000000004
there still not super great

471.039 --> 474.039
but

474.919 --> 481.19899999999996
anyhow hey Richard G good see

477.96 --> 485.12
you wow my I show yesterday had a lot of

481.199 --> 485.12
troll spam mails

485.44 --> 491.879
God but it's not surprising because I

488.08 --> 496.19899999999996
was so incredibly cranky at the

491.879 --> 500.0
start even let it slip out like I hate

496.199 --> 502.96000000000004
Humanity like what the [ __ ]

500.0 --> 505.4
that's and I couldn't even say like yeah

502.96 --> 508.23999999999995
but I also love Humanity I just couldn't

505.4 --> 510.56
say it in a moment I was just really

508.24 --> 512.88
bitter

510.56 --> 516.58
but it is true though like I have a

512.88 --> 518.68
definite LoveHate relationship with

516.58 --> 521.479
[Music]

518.68 --> 525.4399999999999
Humanity one moment I love it intensely

521.479 --> 528.399
the other moment I it just gets seeed

525.44 --> 528.399
with anger about

533.08 --> 540.279
it right but I was watching a show from

537.56 --> 544.079
two days ago Saturday

540.279 --> 544.079
show that one was

545.6 --> 552.32
great I watched like the whole thing and

548.92 --> 552.3199999999999
it was a great

557.48 --> 562.399
show although like oh subliminal

560.24 --> 564.36
messaging oh my God it Tri triggered so

562.399 --> 566.64
many people how dare you say it's not

564.36 --> 572.0790000000001
useless it was made

566.64 --> 572.079
illegal I got all these troll mails just

572.35 --> 577.399
[Music]

573.959 --> 579.3199999999999
ridiculous it all worked out in the end

577.399 --> 582.76
thanks sort

579.32 --> 582.7600000000001
of it got

582.959 --> 588.76
better you could say I was a little

585.399 --> 588.76
demonic but I got

591.519 --> 598.079
better I was tur into a

594.519 --> 598.079
n it got

598.12 --> 601.12
better

605.6 --> 610.399
right and yeah today the sun having a

608.44 --> 613.0790000000001
sun bonus really did

610.399 --> 615.2
help like it does make a difference I

613.079 --> 618.4399999999999
mean I'm just that sensitive with my

615.2 --> 622.36
mood to like the environment I just am

618.44 --> 622.36
very environment

624.11 --> 627.989
[Music]

628.04 --> 631.04
sensitive

631.48 --> 636.5600000000001
you got a lot of troll replies I bet you

634.399 --> 636.56
did

644.279 --> 650.88
duper cuz there's a lot of troll

648.04 --> 652.8389999999999
spies and you basically declared like

650.88 --> 656.88
I'm going to clean

652.839 --> 661.0400000000001
house so like oh my god oh no he's gonna

656.88 --> 661.04
it's G to discover me

662.8 --> 666.92
was my kind of version of spam

668.32 --> 674.2990000000001
[Music]

678.2 --> 683.399
yeah yeah duper by the way there is

680.6 --> 683.399
something weird

684.279 --> 689.92
though where are your

687.959 --> 692.56
messages your

689.92 --> 693.8
messages like in the chat were

692.56 --> 696.1999999999999
completely

693.8 --> 698.399
missing like in the last 2 days

696.2 --> 701.0
apparently for some reason

698.399 --> 703.68
and we don't really understand why

701.0 --> 707.72
that's happening I mean you're still on

703.68 --> 707.7199999999999
the screen in the chat

707.8 --> 714.17
there but yeah I don't know what's going

712.16 --> 717.959
on

714.17 --> 720.959
[Music]

717.959 --> 720.959
there

721.97 --> 725.279
[Music]

739.83 --> 750.88
[Music]

747.88 --> 750.88
m

758.68 --> 761.68
right

769.04 --> 776.8
anyhow yes I was sure on those shows

771.88 --> 776.8
look I was talking to you like an

777.12 --> 784.5600000000001
hour you're there on the screen yes I

780.44 --> 784.5600000000001
was damn sure you there

807.76 --> 812.919
duh

809.59 --> 812.919
[Music]

815.56 --> 822.3599999999999
all

816.959 --> 824.199
right anyhow yeah I just got so many

822.36 --> 827.639
annoyed responses to the whole

824.199 --> 829.7199999999999
subliminal messaging thing cuz that is

827.639 --> 831.9590000000001
like really out there it's like such a

829.72 --> 834.399
big subject but I also realized that

831.959 --> 837.8389999999999
subliminal

834.399 --> 841.279
messaging that I basically like narrowed

837.839 --> 843.759
it down a bit bit in my Approach which

841.279 --> 847.959
is probably the reason why everybody got

843.759 --> 847.9590000000001
so annoyed by it all those

848.0 --> 857.36
trolls because it's not just text that's

853.24 --> 859.8
like appearing very quickly like it is

857.36 --> 862.16
also classified subliminal messaging

859.8 --> 865.079
when you hide like

862.16 --> 868.16
shapes within the background and all

865.079 --> 871.519
that that is apparently also classified

868.16 --> 875.68
as subliminal messaging and that part is

871.519 --> 878.32
definitely applied a lot and it does

875.68 --> 881.92
apparently

878.32 --> 885.399
work so what I was basically rambling on

881.92 --> 886.759
about specifically was about quick

885.399 --> 888.639
hidden

886.759 --> 891.32
words on the

888.639 --> 895.199
screen and that one really doesn't work

891.32 --> 897.6800000000001
all that great but it can trigger like a

895.199 --> 899.399
mentu and

897.68 --> 902.88
candidate

899.399 --> 902.88
can be specifically used for

903.88 --> 911.639
that right but I mean there's I just

908.16 --> 914.279
kind of like try to maneuver my argument

911.639 --> 918.8
like it's not really subliminal

914.279 --> 918.8
messaging if you just hide it in plain s

920.04 --> 924.959
side but technically it is classified

922.959 --> 928.1199999999999
subliminal messages if it's not just

924.959 --> 931.5189999999999
overtly there in the foreground drawing

928.12 --> 933.639
your attention mention then you could

931.519 --> 936.6
consider it to be subliminal messaging

933.639 --> 936.6
just background

943.0 --> 949.0
stuff like if for example one day I had

947.24 --> 952.9590000000001
like a

949.0 --> 956.16
weird object or whatever in my 3D

952.959 --> 958.6389999999999
background here like on the mountain

956.16 --> 961.079
just at one time and nobody spots it and

958.639 --> 964.24
nobody I don't address

961.079 --> 966.959
it like that could be also considered a

964.24 --> 966.9590000000001
subliminal

971.079 --> 977.04
message oh no you didn't get timed out

984.44 --> 990.519
duper see you

987.519 --> 990.519
later

1008.4 --> 1011.5799999999999
[Music]

1017.48 --> 1020.48
oh

1025.919 --> 1029.3190000000002
yeah Paul Cook ended his

1034.319 --> 1039.6
stream kind of weird it was just talking

1036.64 --> 1042.959
about food even though it was supposedly

1039.6 --> 1045.1989999999998
about the pre flood

1042.959 --> 1046.959
structures but maybe he talked about

1045.199 --> 1050.4
that like the first hour or something

1046.959 --> 1050.4
it's a it has been a two

1057.52 --> 1060.52
stream

1061.08 --> 1066.1599999999999
right so what what shall I talk

1066.7 --> 1070.059
[Music]

1077.4 --> 1080.4
about

1085.36 --> 1091.0
Eric de Bay had another anti-god video

1088.12 --> 1093.12
which is just really annoying I didn't

1091.0 --> 1095.36
watch it like I'm

1093.12 --> 1098.6
not I'm not going to sit through all

1095.36 --> 1100.6789999999999
that nonsense again it's very s like

1098.6 --> 1102.9599999999998
he's done multiple of those types of

1100.679 --> 1105.5590000000002
videos and they're all the same it's

1102.96 --> 1107.919
just whiny complaining oh it can't be

1105.559 --> 1109.36
because God can't be good blah blah blah

1107.919 --> 1112.44
blah blah

1109.36 --> 1114.76
same kind of crap as jiren only slightly

1112.44 --> 1114.76
better

1116.12 --> 1122.1589999999999
research

1117.799 --> 1125.08
H yeah but I I definitely can't go with

1122.159 --> 1127.64
Eric dubet when he's rolling out that

1125.08 --> 1130.52
nonsense who am I speaking about Eric

1127.64 --> 1130.5200000000002
dub come

1131.72 --> 1140.32
[Music]

1137.32 --> 1140.32
on

1141.36 --> 1146.609
[Music]

1162.72 --> 1166.1200000000001
right so that that's out

1166.799 --> 1171.039
there that's been really quiet

1177.24 --> 1181.919
day I spent like time just watching my

1180.48 --> 1183.84
own

1181.919 --> 1186.5590000000002
stream so

1183.84 --> 1189.6789999999999
1861 Vision through confrontation I mean

1186.559 --> 1192.44
that show was really amazing I watched

1189.679 --> 1195.159
the whole thing and it was just great

1192.44 --> 1197.799
it's not perfect there were some whiny

1195.159 --> 1199.7990000000002
like me just repeating over and over

1197.799 --> 1202.2
again to akumu virus yeah that got

1199.799 --> 1204.96
really annoying steamy Trav traveler got

1202.2 --> 1209.0800000000002
really annoyed me listening back I got

1204.96 --> 1209.08
really annoyed I should really not do

1210.72 --> 1214.3600000000001
that the droning

1218.799 --> 1223.48
repeating but I did like I mean it was

1221.799 --> 1225.28
basically a ground rule that I was

1223.48 --> 1230.159
putting down and I thought like well

1225.28 --> 1230.1589999999999
maybe if I just repeat it 20 times

1241.76 --> 1247.72
you know what in the dream nightmare I

1245.559 --> 1251.76
have a person who is in

1247.72 --> 1251.76
it no longer here

1252.48 --> 1257.6
what people yeah I know that but I mean

1255.88 --> 1261.0
that doesn't make it less annoying when

1257.6 --> 1262.799
I repeat it 20 times in a row I mean

1261.0 --> 1266.76
that is [ __ ]

1262.799 --> 1266.76
annoying I got to give it

1270.039 --> 1274.6
that but it's just because Akuma was

1272.799 --> 1277.4
pushing back he was like no I'm not

1274.6 --> 1280.1589999999999
going to follow any rules and I just

1277.4 --> 1282.5590000000002
wanted to make it abundantly clear like

1280.159 --> 1286.2
yeah well it's

1282.559 --> 1290.039
not this is not an a scenario that

1286.2 --> 1290.039
requires anybody's agreement

1292.039 --> 1298.36
right but who knows maybe it's just not

1295.2 --> 1298.3600000000001
going to be around

1300.919 --> 1307.88
much he got kind of bitter over all

1304.72 --> 1307.88
that I

1307.919 --> 1313.44
think it's like no he wants to hang

1310.799 --> 1316.32
around in the toilet boil Bowl on the

1313.44 --> 1318.48
internet and talk [ __ ] with a bunch of

1316.32 --> 1320.6399999999999
[ __ ] for no reason just because he

1318.48 --> 1322.84
wants the freedom to be able to do that

1320.64 --> 1324.279
and nobody telling him what to do well

1322.84 --> 1328.279
yeah that means that you don't have a

1324.279 --> 1331.08
place here then and he doesn't like

1328.279 --> 1334.48
it doesn't like that I gave

1331.08 --> 1337.1589999999999
him that ultimatum anyway I'm not going

1334.48 --> 1337.159
to recycle

1346.96 --> 1349.96
it

1350.279 --> 1354.4
I'm getting kind of hungry I'm going to

1352.48 --> 1357.3600000000001
put

1354.4 --> 1360.44
son I'm going to put my Illuminati C on

1357.36 --> 1363.6789999999999
the oven I did have one of

1360.44 --> 1366.559
them run out of bread though like I have

1363.679 --> 1366.5590000000002
to get some of

1367.84 --> 1373.6399999999999
that do why I like telling people what

1370.48 --> 1376.32
to do does it make me feel

1373.64 --> 1380.039
good uh

1376.32 --> 1384.24
no not necessar necessarily but it does

1380.039 --> 1387.1589999999999
feel good to like have

1384.24 --> 1392.2
control over my

1387.159 --> 1395.88
place and the things that I do on a

1392.2 --> 1399.0
platform that is my thing and to just

1395.88 --> 1403.1200000000001
like hold strong that does feel good it

1399.0 --> 1403.12
does feel good not to be easily

1404.799 --> 1410.279
manipulated like that yeah but just

1408.32 --> 1413.1589999999999
telling people what to do no that

1410.279 --> 1415.64
doesn't feel good why because I'm an

1413.159 --> 1419.7990000000002
empath and I can feel what they feel

1415.64 --> 1421.8400000000001
when I do it and the usual reaction is

1419.799 --> 1424.36
nuh

1421.84 --> 1427.12
yeah cuz if I tell people what to do and

1424.36 --> 1429.1999999999998
they're all like yeah yeah yeah then

1427.12 --> 1432.4799999999998
that's doesn't even feel like telling

1429.2 --> 1432.48
people what to do it's

1432.6 --> 1436.84
just you don't have to command anybody

1435.159 --> 1439.88
you're just like saying something and

1436.84 --> 1439.8799999999999
everybody agrees

1442.88 --> 1449.24
yeah it feels good to be on charge of

1446.72 --> 1449.24
the kill

1452.32 --> 1455.32
button

1458.72 --> 1467.2
uh good it makes me feel less

1464.2 --> 1469.6000000000001
miserable if I'm just stuck around

1467.2 --> 1473.52
people that are obsessed with bullying

1469.6 --> 1476.36
me and I can't do anything about it

1473.52 --> 1479.0
yeah I don't particularly get a kick out

1476.36 --> 1483.32
of like oh I can ban people oh it's such

1479.0 --> 1487.48
a power oh no but it

1483.32 --> 1491.72
is very pleasant that I don't have to

1487.48 --> 1494.0
force myself to sit through nasty ass

1491.72 --> 1496.08
scumbags that have nothing better to do

1494.0 --> 1498.08
in their lives that but try to make my

1496.08 --> 1500.96
life miserable and that I can do

1498.08 --> 1500.96
something about it

1505.96 --> 1509.279
yes oh

1511.279 --> 1516.559
wow you might be bully people

1516.64 --> 1524.279

around in your shitty Discord groups

1736.399 --> 1739.399
yeah

1748.1 --> 1751.25
[Music]

1765.64 --> 1772.44
oh yeah

1768.63 --> 1773.919
[Music]

1772.44 --> 1776.64
there's some freaky [ __ ] here in the

1773.919 --> 1780.039
Netherlands going like this

1776.64 --> 1780.039
whole some

1780.12 --> 1785.5189999999998
scandal with a store that literally

1783.64 --> 1787.679
which is weird by the way because I was

1785.519 --> 1790.76
talking yesterday about subliminals and

1787.679 --> 1792.799
all that and then this appeared some

1790.76 --> 1799.32
really [ __ ]

1792.799 --> 1799.32
up well pedo subliminals like really bad

1805.799 --> 1809.84
bad in this store here and they're

1808.44 --> 1814.3600000000001
they're getting

1809.84 --> 1818.72
it like they are like really getting a

1814.36 --> 1818.7199999999998
lot of angry people over

1819.039 --> 1824.64
that it's and it's like an older Store

1821.88 --> 1826.24
franchise and it's just gone as [ __ ]

1824.64 --> 1829.88
it's

1826.24 --> 1833.88
like it's like a one of

1829.88 --> 1837.679
those just cheap China shitty products

1833.88 --> 1837.679
and sjw crap

1840.12 --> 1846.0
everywhere called hmer and it's weird

1843.44 --> 1849.64
because they used to be kind of a cool

1846.0 --> 1852.039
store like 30 years

1849.64 --> 1854.2800000000002
ago that just had a lot of different

1852.039 --> 1856.24
stuff and now

1854.28 --> 1859.24
[Music]

1856.24 --> 1859.24
it's

1860.159 --> 1862.48
it's

1880.44 --> 1885.8400000000001
corrupted right so that happened after

1883.24 --> 1887.799
my show that so that's always weird like

1885.84 --> 1889.48
oh talking about sublima this [ __ ]

1887.799 --> 1894.639
happens like

1889.48 --> 1894.6390000000001
what but I mean it doesn't

1897.76 --> 1904.36
work it didn't sneak in anything like

1901.72 --> 1907.49
everybody just noticed it right

1904.36 --> 1907.49
[Music]

1915.84 --> 1919.6789999999999
there all right so that

1923.07 --> 1926.26
[Music]

1946.08 --> 1950.24
happened

1948.039 --> 1953.48
so yeah I don't really know what else to

1950.24 --> 1955.76
talk Richard G what what else can we

1953.48 --> 1959.3990000000001
talk about like we're not going to talk

1955.76 --> 1961.72
about akumu virus he's he's out he might

1959.399 --> 1963.799
be back tomorrow but I'm not really

1961.72 --> 1965.84
eager to welcome him back because he's

1963.799 --> 1967.08
done nothing but whine and complain in

1965.84 --> 1970.24
the last

1967.08 --> 1973.6
week and oh I didn't do that and didn't

1970.24 --> 1975.639
shut the [ __ ] up you have you're whining

1973.6 --> 1978.519
and complaining and don't care that you

1975.639 --> 1981.6
don't recognize that you're doing that

1978.519 --> 1981.6
anyway I'll be right

2005.96 --> 2008.96
back

2057.24 --> 2059.839
come on

2059.96 --> 2064.92
guys

2061.87 --> 2064.92
[Music]

2065.879 --> 2070.04
Richard

2068.0 --> 2071.04
hey that message just didn't show up

2070.04 --> 2074.13
what the

2071.04 --> 2074.13
[Music]

2076.079 --> 2079.28
hell that's

2080.76 --> 2084.3990000000003
freaky episode of

2085.159 --> 2089.32
Simpsons eyes clapped

2090.52 --> 2095.56
what

2093.52 --> 2100.0
whoa

2095.56 --> 2100.0
damn yeah right that's messed

2107.92 --> 2114.599
up but I mean that'll that's not very

2112.04 --> 2117.16
subliminal yeah that's kind of

2114.599 --> 2119.88
overt like that's just overt

2117.16 --> 2122.7599999999998
indoctrination it's like

2119.88 --> 2125.8
forcing something on to

2122.76 --> 2127.7200000000003
you that's like Clockwork

2125.8 --> 2129.5600000000004
Orange

2127.72 --> 2131.68
which is also about that like there's no

2129.56 --> 2133.72
subliminals going on in clock word of

2131.68 --> 2136.48
orange like it's quite

2133.72 --> 2139.2
overt right so it's not really sublim

2136.48 --> 2141.92
like it's programming it's social

2139.2 --> 2144.2
engineering it's mind control but it's

2141.92 --> 2146.599
not subliminal

2144.2 --> 2148.7599999999998
messaging cuz subliminal is all about

2146.599 --> 2148.76
the

2149.079 --> 2155.48
subtleties it's about not being over it

2152.56 --> 2155.48
sneaking things

2155.8 --> 2160.96
through

2157.839 --> 2160.96
but yes definitely

2172.76 --> 2177.5600000000004
programming does overt work better

2177.839 --> 2184.04
yeah well it just reprogram something or

2184.76 --> 2194.44
somebody and it's destructive

2189.96 --> 2197.4
though to do it you're forcing like

2194.44 --> 2200.28
a a thing on the person and eventually

2197.4 --> 2203.28
they'll catch on and they'll just have

2200.28 --> 2207.96
get trouble with it like serious

2203.28 --> 2211.1600000000003
programming is just basically forced

2207.96 --> 2214.119
trauma it is all through trauma when you

2211.16 --> 2214.1189999999997
get overt like

2215.68 --> 2218.68
that

2221.319 --> 2225.56
hey slow Moon buy good to see you

2234.28 --> 2238.3190000000004
what okay slowmo that's

2238.55 --> 2241.639
[Music]

2245.359 --> 2251.44
funny all right but the whole the idea

2248.44 --> 2255.0
about subliminal messaging is that you

2251.44 --> 2257.599
can basically program the public without

2255.0 --> 2262.079
them being disturbed by

2257.599 --> 2265.119
it yeah so that you can sneak things

2262.079 --> 2267.2000000000003
through without riling them up because

2265.119 --> 2270.96
if you just overtly program which would

2267.2 --> 2273.2
be like oh they we're going to war and

2270.96 --> 2277.0
then War propaganda and like oh they're

2273.2 --> 2280.359
bad like that's overt it has a direct

2277.0 --> 2282.599
impact on people it's addresses their

2280.359 --> 2285.24
conscious doesn't bypass them and they

2282.599 --> 2287.92
might and some will

2285.24 --> 2290.4399999999996
resist and then you get a new

2287.92 --> 2292.7200000000003
situation and if you get a new situation

2290.44 --> 2296.52
it might become more difficult to

2292.72 --> 2298.68
program them than if they hadn't been

2296.52 --> 2300.28
aware of anything right so subliminal

2298.68 --> 2301.839
message is more

2300.28 --> 2305.52
subtle

2301.839 --> 2310.0789999999997
leaving the collective Minds intact sort

2305.52 --> 2312.56
of well overt programming might work

2310.079 --> 2315.04
really well if it's like if there's a

2312.56 --> 2318.24
necessity and

2315.04 --> 2318.24
like it

2318.96 --> 2329.76
works but I mean like then you change

2324.64 --> 2329.7599999999998
everything can't just undo overt

2335.52 --> 2338.52
programming

2339.72 --> 2346.2
programming in fashion is apparent to

2343.04 --> 2348.079
you well they like to stick good idea

2346.2 --> 2350.48
like ideas that stick to mind right I

2348.079 --> 2352.8
mean in a way it's sort of even what I

2350.48 --> 2355.359
do with my titles it's like I just put

2352.8 --> 2360.6800000000003
in like a a

2355.359 --> 2363.96
real a more complicated thought into a

2360.68 --> 2366.5989999999997
simple structure is like whereby looking

2363.96 --> 2369.7200000000003
at the title like you know there's a lot

2366.599 --> 2372.1600000000003
there that is going to be discussed like

2369.72 --> 2372.16
there's an

2374.119 --> 2378.92
item so that my titles of my shows are

2377.96 --> 2381.64
like

2378.92 --> 2384.2400000000002
programming they're like programming to

2381.64 --> 2386.8799999999997
invite you in and like hey look at what

2384.24 --> 2389.1189999999997

2386.88 --> 2392.6800000000003
interesting don't you want to know what

2389.119 --> 2392.6800000000003

2394.24 --> 2402.319
right and like the yeah a lot of people

2398.68 --> 2405.56
in with media shows and all that do that

2402.319 --> 2409.68

2405.56 --> 2409.68
products Alo try to do

2412.599 --> 2421.6800000000003
that some more than others like with the

2416.92 --> 2423.56
gross perfume stuff like it's just pure

2421.68 --> 2427.319
programming

2423.56 --> 2430.2799999999997
like the programming is like more overt

2427.319 --> 2432.44
than even the product there right it's

2430.28 --> 2434.8390000000004
more like oh you want to be part of this

2432.44 --> 2437.359

2502.0 --> 2506.359
though social engineering from

2504.28 --> 2510.2000000000003
subliminal to overt trauma based

2506.359 --> 2510.2
programming it's in the title

2515.24 --> 2518.24
now

2523.73 --> 2528.939

2691.599 --> 2697.2400000000002
look this thing is going to eventually

2694.24 --> 2699.72
turn absolutely hor this

2697.24 --> 2702.7999999999997
here cuz we now think like oh yes

2699.72 --> 2707.2799999999997
they're Breaking Free from the sjws but

2702.8 --> 2709.559
when when it does like succeed they're

2707.28 --> 2713.0
going to [ __ ] Europe

2709.559 --> 2716.6400000000003
up like we they're Russia and America

2713.0 --> 2720.48

2716.64 --> 2724.319
not to unseed these disgusting [ __ ]

Nazis I think they're going to just make

2724.319 --> 2728.96
everything harder like they're not going

2726.8 --> 2731.88
to rescue us they're going to be like no

you and you will actually die from that

2753.16 --> 2758.7599999999998
then unlike what you tried with us

2756.76 --> 2760.88
yeah because Europe tried to sanction

2758.76 --> 2764.8
Russia it totally doesn't

2760.88 --> 2767.96
work they're going to do it back we're

2764.8 --> 2771.2400000000002
dead and they are going to do that and

2767.96 --> 2771.2400000000002
we [ __ ] deserve it

2778.16 --> 2784.0

[Music]

2814.8 --> 2820.7200000000003
chat

2820.72 --> 2825.2799999999997
saying that to somebody I was saying

2823.839 --> 2828.72
that as an

2825.28 --> 2831.88
expression within I'm

2828.72 --> 2834.52
sorry maybe next time when you tune in

2831.88 --> 2837.839
and you hear that word at first like

2834.52 --> 2839.319
just not immediately write a sentence

2837.839 --> 2844.2799999999997
about

2839.319 --> 2847.16
it and just let the show go like keep

2844.28 --> 2851.44
listening and then find out you don't

2847.16 --> 2854.0
have to ask it like if I die die die die

2851.44 --> 2858.2000000000003
you'll find out you don't have to ask

2854.0 --> 2858.2
about it I wasn't planning

2858.44 --> 2864.0
to this just

2861.24 --> 2867.2799999999997
another way it's not the right way to

2864.0 --> 2869.38
answer to enter if you don't like it

2867.28 --> 2871.28
then don't immediately bring it

2869.38 --> 2874.359
[Music]

2871.28 --> 2876.8
up it's like a Kuma virus got in here I

2874.359 --> 2880.7999999999997
timed him out 24 hours because he's just

2876.8 --> 2883.119
like no you're wrong about me

2880.8 --> 2884.98
like the [ __ ] kind of way is that to

2883.119 --> 2894.28
enter my

2884.98 --> 2894.28
[Music]

2897.04 --> 2905.68
chat I'm just talking about like we're

2900.24 --> 2909.2799999999997
screwed no don't relax dude me you relax

2905.68 --> 2909.2799999999997
you started this not

2912.96 --> 2916.4
me I am

2917.16 --> 2923.44
relaxed people coming in here

2919.24 --> 2923.4399999999996
complaining is what makes me not

2923.94 --> 2928.55
[Music]

2933.44 --> 2939.88
relaxed all right let I'm just say

2936.96 --> 2942.04
from my Visions I know we're going to be

2939.88 --> 2945.799
screwed and it's

2942.04 --> 2948.119
like right it's their entire plight it's

2945.799 --> 2950.319
the plight of the Demons to me like why

2948.119 --> 2954.4
I should be anti-russia because in the

2950.319 --> 2954.4
end Europe is completely

2956.839 --> 2963.5589999999997
[ __ ] yeah they're not going to come to

2960.28 --> 2966.28
rescue us if we don't deal with our

2963.559 --> 2967.6400000000003
[ __ ] up Elites that are lit trying to

2966.28 --> 2969.2200000000003
kill us

2967.64 --> 2970.319
all

2969.22 --> 2973.2799999999997
[Music]

2970.319 --> 2975.599
then that's our

2973.28 --> 2978.2400000000002
problem the attitude is going to be like

2975.599 --> 2981.96
oh well you got your [ __ ] Soviet

2978.24 --> 2984.4799999999996
Union now you deal with them like we did

2981.96 --> 2987.4
like we have to do that yeah remember me

2984.48 --> 2988.53
saying like hey we have to eventually

2987.4 --> 2990.359
take care of

2988.53 --> 2993.559
[Music]

2990.359 --> 2997.16
them because that is fact and if you're

2993.559 --> 2999.4
like no no there's not way we do things

2997.16 --> 3001.839
okay well then prepare to die prepare to

2999.4 --> 3004.48
have your entire people everything you

3001.839 --> 3008.599
know exterminated

3004.48 --> 3012.96
gradually cuz they're not going to

3008.599 --> 3012.96
rescue us from the

3015.3 --> 3021.04
[Music]

3018.04 --> 3021.04
tyrants

3021.51 --> 3027.44
[Music]

3024.44 --> 3027.44
bro

3027.74 --> 3034.72
[Music]

3032.76 --> 3039.599
Christian no it's not a fair question

3034.72 --> 3042.2
it's just another whining wanker that

3039.599 --> 3044.119
thinks they have the right to just pop

3042.2 --> 3046.48
up for the first time and whine and

3044.119 --> 3054.44
complain you don't shut the [ __ ]

3046.48 --> 3057.39
[Music]

3054.44 --> 3065.319
up

3057.39 --> 3069.1189999999997
[Music]

3065.319 --> 3072.04
yeah it's strong but I mean it's mostly

3069.119 --> 3072.04
because people in

3072.119 --> 3076.48
pain there's a lot of people in pain

3074.52 --> 3079.4
because they know it's going to go and

3076.48 --> 3081.68
they thought oh we just we could just be

3079.4 --> 3085.04
trolls and be satanic

3081.68 --> 3087.44
and disgusting all our lives and there's

3085.04 --> 3090.839
no problem and we're going to win we're

3087.44 --> 3094.04
overcoming God no you are going to

3090.839 --> 3099.449
suffer a

3094.04 --> 3099.449
[Music]

3101.82 --> 3115.599
[Music]

3112.119 --> 3117.76
lot right because Russia is winning they

3115.599 --> 3121.2000000000003
are going to win they have won and they

3117.76 --> 3124.4
are going to win yeah just like Flat

3121.2 --> 3126.96
Earth versus the globe we won we won

3124.4 --> 3129.559
like years

3126.96 --> 3132.76
ago like it got

3129.559 --> 3135.599
boring because there's no more argument

3132.76 --> 3137.6400000000003
to be one we've won it all and all we're

3135.599 --> 3139.4
dealing with is just double thinking

3137.64 --> 3142.2
people that are just perpetually in

3139.4 --> 3144.28
denial well that's not really an

3142.2 --> 3145.5
argument you can

3144.28 --> 3148.559
win

3145.5 --> 3148.559
[Music]

3149.0 --> 3154.319
you can't convince somebody that's

3150.799 --> 3154.319
willingly lying to

3158.36 --> 3161.599
[Music]

3159.72 --> 3165.2799999999997
themselves all right I'm going to get my

3161.599 --> 3165.28
Illuminati C I'll be right

3171.22 --> 3176.66
[Music]

3174.24 --> 3180.5099999999998
back

3176.66 --> 3180.5099999999998
[Music]

3191.46 --> 3199.429
[Music]

3204.16 --> 3207.16
for

3211.559 --> 3216.0
look at how good it

3213.24 --> 3221.3999999999996
looks still very hot

3216.0 --> 3221.4
though can't wait I can't wait I'll have

3224.56 --> 3237.16
[Music]

3232.24 --> 3237.16
to right but yeah it in fact remains

3237.359 --> 3246.2
like the Soviet system here in in Europe

3242.839 --> 3248.4
is being exposed and being like it's not

3246.2 --> 3250.72
going to

3248.4 --> 3253.839
succeed that's the big difference

3250.72 --> 3257.1189999999997
between the Russian Soviet Union because

3253.839 --> 3259.839
they despite everything did actually

3257.119 --> 3261.44
kind of succeed and then on the long run

3259.839 --> 3265.24
it all went to

3261.44 --> 3267.2000000000003
[ __ ] you get the typical problems like

3265.24 --> 3270.5989999999997
which basically proved that communism

3267.2 --> 3270.5989999999997
doesn't really work on the long

3271.92 --> 3275.6800000000003
run and that's why they transformed out

3274.4 --> 3279.52
of

3275.68 --> 3282.24
it but the Russians were just organized

3279.52 --> 3282.24
so much

3282.96 --> 3290.839
better like people would actually

3287.2 --> 3293.9199999999996
really do their best to make it

3290.839 --> 3296.2799999999997
work people in their government weren't

3293.92 --> 3298.92
just disgusting corrupt demons that were

3296.28 --> 3301.28
just like we're going to abuse our power

3298.92 --> 3304.48
all day long yeah I mean the West love

3301.28 --> 3307.079
to fantasize about that nonstop and

3304.48 --> 3310.319
there were some bureaucratic

3307.079 --> 3310.319
things of

3311.0 --> 3318.359
course what the

3314.079 --> 3318.3590000000004
hell duper what the [ __ ] are you

3324.0 --> 3327.0
doing

3337.039 --> 3347.2400000000002
what I thought that for a

3341.28 --> 3350.2400000000002
moment right like do you mean jeans that

3347.24 --> 3350.24
is

3352.52 --> 3356.64
yeah I mean I agree they're very

3355.2 --> 3360.5589999999997
annoying

3356.64 --> 3360.5589999999997
but hating them

3365.66 --> 3370.1189999999997
[Music]

3367.68 --> 3373.68
no Freud didn't

3370.119 --> 3375.6800000000003
slip yeah it was subliminal programming

3373.68 --> 3379.9199999999996
it was the subliminal programming that

3375.68 --> 3379.9199999999996
came out seeking star

3382.119 --> 3388.1600000000003
water maybe it was all the talk of the

3384.96 --> 3390.68
fin solution yesterday that did it I

3388.16 --> 3393.5989999999997
mean in a way you could regard that as

3390.68 --> 3398.2799999999997
some form of subliminal

3393.599 --> 3401.6400000000003
messaging but it's it's more like

3398.28 --> 3401.6400000000003
just being

3402.76 --> 3409.1600000000003
annoying but I mean though if if you

3406.52 --> 3411.2
don't address that part and you just

3409.16 --> 3414.0
thought about what I said like yeah we

3411.2 --> 3416.68
do kind of need a durable solution to

3414.0 --> 3419.52
this problem right

3416.68 --> 3424.0389999999998
a a solution that's going to

3419.52 --> 3428.44
really stop this problem from

3424.039 --> 3430.28
contina a final solution if you

3428.44 --> 3433.64
will

3430.28 --> 3434.799
right but I mean yeah because of the

3433.64 --> 3440.0
words

3434.799 --> 3442.64
and it was a joke sort of I mean I do

3440.0 --> 3446.799
actually I am a proponent for some kind

3442.64 --> 3446.799
of more durable permanent

3448.839 --> 3455.72
ution but to be fair like I don't really

3453.319 --> 3455.72
think

3456.88 --> 3462.1600000000003
that it would have to even be that

3459.48 --> 3466.52
brutal it would but it would have to be

3462.16 --> 3466.52
like yeah the game is over now

3473.799 --> 3476.799
definitely

3479.72 --> 3484.68
right but I mean like in the meantime

3482.599 --> 3486.92
it's like there's a Soviet system here

3484.68 --> 3489.1189999999997
in Europe trying to be erected it's

3486.92 --> 3493.2400000000002
being recognized it's being resisted

3489.119 --> 3496.0
like actually resisted yeah

3493.24 --> 3497.9199999999996
that barely happened in Russia because

3496.0 --> 3501.4
when it did there would be immediate

3497.92 --> 3504.16
military response like that's the big

3501.4 --> 3506.52
difference Sofi had Russia was much more

3504.16 --> 3509.2
militant

3506.52 --> 3509.2
compared to

3511.52 --> 3518.0
Europe Europe is seems to be

3514.799 --> 3521.0
more focused on attempting mind control

3518.0 --> 3526.24
but they're failing

3521.0 --> 3526.24
horrendously they've taken it way too

3527.24 --> 3533.72
far

3529.0 --> 3536.72
like like they were trying to destroy

3533.72 --> 3536.72
it

3537.28 --> 3542.3590000000004
like they thought like wow we got this

3539.44 --> 3545.92
all this knowledge developed of how we

3542.359 --> 3550.359
can manipulate let's do all of it like

3545.92 --> 3554.6800000000003
you idiots you

3550.359 --> 3558.0
unbelievable dumb asses

3554.68 --> 3561.44
yeah you're so

3558.0 --> 3565.48
stupid it's like you got all that power

3561.44 --> 3568.48
and still you manag to completely ruin

3565.48 --> 3572.559
it you're so

3568.48 --> 3572.559
dumb you're so

3580.76 --> 3588.0
dumb like you guys the people in control

3584.44 --> 3590.7200000000003
that are part of this cabal and

3588.0 --> 3592.28
this disgusting

3590.72 --> 3595.64
Soviet

3592.28 --> 3598.119
Europe Empire attempt there's so dumb

3595.64 --> 3602.799
they're so pathetic like those people

3598.119 --> 3602.799
can't rule like they can't

3604.16 --> 3608.48
yeah

3606.079 --> 3610.88
Russia when it was Soviet yeah there

3608.48 --> 3615.68
were terrible things there but they

3610.88 --> 3618.92
actually managed they did it also giant

3615.68 --> 3623.5589999999997
calamities famine [ __ ] things went wrong

3618.92 --> 3627.52
oh yeah but they did actually work for a

3623.559 --> 3631.039
while this thing is is like literally as

3627.52 --> 3633.839
it's being built it's already

3631.039 --> 3636.079
crumbling like massively like this never

3633.839 --> 3636.92
going to work it's going to be a ruins

3636.079 --> 3639.0
at

3636.92 --> 3641.839
best a

3639.0 --> 3645.799
ruined ruins of its

3641.839 --> 3645.799
Soviet attempt it's

3650.24 --> 3654.1189999999997
pathetic I am in Europe what are you

3652.64 --> 3656.44
talking what do you think I'm talking

3654.119 --> 3659.599
about

3656.44 --> 3661.2000000000003
the attempt of turning Europe into a

3659.599 --> 3664.2000000000003
Soviet

3661.2 --> 3664.2
Empire

3665.359 --> 3669.0389999999998
yeah like

3667.48 --> 3675.16
environmentalist

3669.039 --> 3675.1600000000003
based Financial slavery and Neo

3677.0 --> 3681.92
feudalism where here it's right here but

3679.799 --> 3683.96
it's already crumbling so you don't have

3681.92 --> 3688.0
to worry about it yeah there will be

3683.96 --> 3688.0
people that we'll never even know it

3691.599 --> 3697.4
happened because it's never going to

3694.079 --> 3700.76
succeed I mean it's already being

3697.4 --> 3704.64
overthrown even it is trying to

3700.76 --> 3707.7990000000004
build like everybody is aware of it or

3704.64 --> 3707.799
well everybody that really

3708.44 --> 3715.44
matters late stage capitalism

3712.68 --> 3717.8799999999997
what well you could call it

3715.44 --> 3720.92
that but I mean what is happening in

3717.88 --> 3724.839
Europe has very little to do with

3720.92 --> 3727.76
capitalism like carbon

3724.839 --> 3732.24
credit [ __ ] that that has nothing to

3727.76 --> 3732.2400000000002
do with capitalism it's all fake

3733.64 --> 3740.359
environmentalism it's just oh look we

3736.24 --> 3745.0
got some mythical excuse for locking you

3740.359 --> 3747.279
down and not giving you a permit because

3745.0 --> 3749.96
you something in in what you were doing

3747.279 --> 3751.4
is bad for the mother earth which is

3749.96 --> 3753.96
complete

3751.4 --> 3756.599
nonsense

3753.96 --> 3758.599
disproven like their

3756.599 --> 3762.839
entire

3758.599 --> 3764.48
thing is all based on fraud like on

3762.839 --> 3767.839
overt

3764.48 --> 3771.359
lies everything all their systems are

3767.839 --> 3773.0
based on overt lies brutal lies in

3771.359 --> 3774.96
everything everything they bring forward

3773.0 --> 3777.44
it's always a dis disgusting

3774.96 --> 3779.799
straightforward lie everybody knows it's

3777.44 --> 3781.4
ridiculous unless you're really an

3779.799 --> 3783.96
uninformed numpty and you don't know

3781.4 --> 3783.96
anything about

3786.43 --> 3789.54
[Music]

3790.44 --> 3795.079
anything greenwashing that's interesting

3793.799 --> 3801.319
debatable

3795.079 --> 3804.799
D gasoline to force flow of and forced

3801.319 --> 3806.48
by but it's not it's not the

3804.799 --> 3809.839
that's not

3806.48 --> 3809.839
capitalism it's

3810.039 --> 3815.559
technocracy yeah if all the major

3812.359 --> 3817.24
industrial figures and Banks decide that

3815.559 --> 3820.599
that is how they do

3817.24 --> 3822.799
it and then Force everybody else to go

3820.599 --> 3826.039
along with that because they have all

3822.799 --> 3830.24
the power they have all the

3826.039 --> 3835.119
money this technocracy it's not

3830.24 --> 3836.839
capitalism it capitalism would be hey

3835.119 --> 3840.6400000000003
yeah you can try to

3836.839 --> 3842.279
compete oh but oh look oh you oh you

3840.64 --> 3844.0789999999997
need to take account for this and that

3842.279 --> 3846.279
and that and that and that and that oh

3844.079 --> 3847.48
oh you can't start a business then yeah

3846.279 --> 3850.4
yeah that's not

3847.48 --> 3854.16
capitalism it's called a technocracy

3850.4 --> 3856.279
where big Power or

3854.16 --> 3858.8799999999997
oligarchy where the biggest money and

3856.279 --> 3861.48
the power can do everything they can

3858.88 --> 3865.119
fulfill the stupid bureaucratic rules

3861.48 --> 3868.319
bypass the taxation so that they can

3865.119 --> 3870.2400000000002
remain existent as a company while

3868.319 --> 3872.24
little guys can't because they're

3870.24 --> 3874.279
getting buried under nonsensical

3872.24 --> 3876.5589999999997
bureaucratic rules yeah that's not

3874.279 --> 3880.119
capitalism that's the opposite of

3876.559 --> 3882.3590000000004
capitalism yeah capitalism is like no

3880.119 --> 3886.0
anybody can do

3882.359 --> 3888.839
it because the rules are little and the

3886.0 --> 3891.2
taxation is low yeah that's not what's

3888.839 --> 3893.16
happening right now it's exactly the

3891.2 --> 3895.2
opposite there nothing to do with

3893.16 --> 3899.96
capitalism

3895.2 --> 3903.0789999999997
it's it's more a Soviet communist

3899.96 --> 3906.119
system and in those systems it's only

3903.079 --> 3908.7200000000003
big money big

3906.119 --> 3910.52
Tech that gets to do anything because

3908.72 --> 3914.5589999999997
they're the only ones that have the

3910.52 --> 3918.48
power to actually abide by the

3914.559 --> 3921.119
rules that they help make to to make

3918.48 --> 3924.88
sure that they don't get any competition

3921.119 --> 3928.88
yeah that's real communism it's the ex

3924.88 --> 3933.2400000000002
opposite real communism is like an

3928.88 --> 3937.4
oligarchy system a feudal type

3933.24 --> 3940.2
system where the Lords are just the ones

3937.4 --> 3942.52
with the most money and

3940.2 --> 3944.96
power and they get to determine what

3942.52 --> 3948.2
everybody has to

3944.96 --> 3952.359
do because the the rest can't oppose

3948.2 --> 3956.4399999999996
them that's Neo feudalism it's communism

3952.359 --> 3956.44
it's the opposite of

3957.44 --> 3962.76
capitalism capitalistic monopolies yeah

3960.319 --> 3966.88
but the whole point about capitalism is

3962.76 --> 3970.7200000000003
that there shouldn't be any

3966.88 --> 3973.1600000000003
monopolies yeah Anti-Trust laws they're

3970.72 --> 3976.279
part of capital if you don't enforce

3973.16 --> 3979.2
them then it's not capitalism anymore it

3976.279 --> 3982.119
automatically becomes the other

3979.2 --> 3985.16
thing yeah monopoly laws have not been

3982.119 --> 3987.799
enforced there's been huge corporations

3985.16 --> 3990.44
they've been completely left to their

3987.799 --> 3994.279
devices

3990.44 --> 3999.88
unobstructed they all pay less than 1%

3994.279 --> 4002.599
tax and nobody does anything about

3999.88 --> 4004.76
it yeah that's not

4002.599 --> 4007.48
capitalism in

4004.76 --> 4010.1600000000003
capitalism money Powers can't get a

4007.48 --> 4012.599
monopoly that's the whole point if

4010.16 --> 4014.5989999999997
something can get a monopoly then that

4012.599 --> 4016.6800000000003
means they're the only one that can do

4014.599 --> 4020.48
it that takes away the option of people

4016.68 --> 4022.16
that want to do that on their own then

4020.48 --> 4026.2400000000002
you don't have

4022.16 --> 4030.2
capitalism capitalism is only capitalism

4026.24 --> 4033.0789999999997
if you can compete even at a small

4030.2 --> 4037.359
scale then it's capitalism if you can't

4033.079 --> 4037.3590000000004
compete at a small scale it's not

4038.799 --> 4044.64
capitalism against free market no I'm

4041.319 --> 4046.079
against Monopoly marketing that's what

4044.64 --> 4049.68
I'm

4046.079 --> 4049.6800000000003
against pleases

4054.079 --> 4059.3590000000004
you no free market is only free if you

4057.319 --> 4061.079
can compete if there's something there

4059.359 --> 4063.92
that's too

4061.079 --> 4066.559
big that doesn't allow

4063.92 --> 4069.76
competition what is free market about it

4066.559 --> 4071.799
it just means they just own the market

4069.76 --> 4075.5200000000004
and you'll just have to do whatever they

4071.799 --> 4078.96
say or you can't do anything in that

4075.52 --> 4083.079
market yeah that's not

4078.96 --> 4083.079
free that's an owned

4084.279 --> 4088.44
Market yeah that that's also how fascism

4087.2 --> 4090.799
works by the

4088.44 --> 4092.48
way yeah that's how they operate it's

4090.799 --> 4095.52
like oh a big Corporation oh yeah they

4092.48 --> 4097.04
get all the deals they get to determine

4095.52 --> 4101.44
what

4097.04 --> 4101.44
happens yeah it's the same thing

4102.08 --> 4108.799
fascism autocracy one with the most

4105.08 --> 4111.08
power gets to decide how everybody lives

4108.799 --> 4111.08
their

4116.319 --> 4122.04
lives various Market

4119.04 --> 4122.04
P

4122.839 --> 4128.64
okay well I don't I'm not really up to

4125.759 --> 4131.64
date with like oh business and free

4128.64 --> 4134.719
market philosophy and all that debatable

4131.64 --> 4136.759
D I just remember that that even in the

4134.719 --> 4140.0
'90s it was already an issue like there

4136.759 --> 4142.44
were still monopoly laws being

4140.0 --> 4145.64
discussed it was like this issue with

4142.44 --> 4146.599999999999
Microsoft and Bill Gates even back then

4145.64 --> 4149.52
like

4146.6 --> 4153.04
uh they're supposed to split

4149.52 --> 4155.0
up and then they stopped enforcing it

4153.04 --> 4157.2789999999995
that that kind of happened around the

4155.0 --> 4160.0
end of the 90s and then suddenly it's

4157.279 --> 4161.96
like oh they just no they're just left

4160.0 --> 4163.199
like that and everybody's like when are

4161.96 --> 4164.64
these companies going to break up

4163.199 --> 4168.759
they're ruining the

4164.64 --> 4168.759
market and then they just stop doing

4170.48 --> 4175.4
it cuz

4172.64 --> 4180.6
capitalism is like you can't have a free

4175.4 --> 4180.599999999999
market if there if a monopoly can

4185.6 --> 4192.719
form like you can have the best product

4188.839 --> 4194.239
and that by that way like win in the

4192.719 --> 4198.32
market

4194.239 --> 4200.5199999999995
but if like the whole setting is so that

4198.32 --> 4204.5199999999995
literally nothing can ever compete with

4200.52 --> 4208.0
you can't like try to make a cheaper

4204.52 --> 4209.92
version that is nearly as good and like

4208.0 --> 4211.84
that would be competition now there is

4209.92 --> 4214.12
competition well if that just doesn't

4211.84 --> 4216.1990000000005
work at all and nothing can compete then

4214.12 --> 4218.92
when how is that a free market then

4216.199 --> 4222.639999999999
there isn't any now Kum virus did not

4218.92 --> 4225.0
get banned he get a 24-hour time out

4222.64 --> 4227.4800000000005
d

4225.0 --> 4227.48
limited

4227.56 --> 4234.64
capitalism yeah limited but that is

4231.64 --> 4234.64
capitalism

4235.8 --> 4242.1990000000005
yeah what capitalism is supposed to do

4238.88 --> 4243.719
is keep the economy going and keep

4242.199 --> 4246.08
improving

4243.719 --> 4248.679
products to improve the market that's

4246.08 --> 4251.199
the real purpose of capitalism if a

4248.679 --> 4254.8
monopoly can just

4251.199 --> 4259.719
form and like a person person that owns

4254.8 --> 4263.4400000000005
it can just determine how things go

4259.719 --> 4263.44
well that's an

4263.8 --> 4268.76
oligarchy competition is a sin is

4266.56 --> 4270.8
something that comes to mind that's what

4268.76 --> 4273.360000000001
people that are typically

4270.8 --> 4276.719
monopolists think that's what they

4273.36 --> 4279.679
believe that's what they religiously

4276.719 --> 4282.64
teach each other and themselves in the

4279.679 --> 4284.679
family and so if you let those people

4282.64 --> 4287.08
just have that power or they will ruin

4284.679 --> 4290.12
the free

4287.08 --> 4293.96
market anti-monopoly Anti-Trust laws

4290.12 --> 4298.12
were specifically designed to tackle

4293.96 --> 4300.12
that problem and then they were not

4298.12 --> 4302.2
being enforced anymore and that's what

4300.12 --> 4305.39
caused all of this

4302.2 --> 4305.389999999999
[Music]

4309.44 --> 4314.599999999999
[ __ ] yeah that's right regulate small

4312.36 --> 4318.5599999999995
guys out of the look at that's exactly

4314.6 --> 4321.84
what's in China yeah China

4318.56 --> 4325.0
huge biggest Market in the

4321.84 --> 4327.52
world but it's all just Mega

4325.0 --> 4329.96
corporations that own it like little

4327.52 --> 4332.040000000001
guys the state doesn't give a [ __ ] about

4329.96 --> 4333.12
the little guy if you can't compete they

4332.04 --> 4337.8
don't

4333.12 --> 4340.599999999999
care screw you just take the slave

4337.8 --> 4342.4800000000005
job that's that's how they deal with it

4340.6 --> 4345.4800000000005
right because it's not

4342.48 --> 4345.48
capitalism

4348.4 --> 4356.719
right capitalism is really to create the

4352.679 --> 4360.12
bottoms up system for entrepreneurs

4356.719 --> 4362.76
and people yeah businessmen to start

4360.12 --> 4365.12
small and grow it and make a good thing

4362.76 --> 4367.84
out of it and to have that process

4365.12 --> 4367.84
continually

4367.88 --> 4373.96
happen

4369.84 --> 4378.4400000000005
right if one big Corporation that has a

4373.96 --> 4381.28
market can just consume everything then

4378.44 --> 4383.638999999999
you can't compete with that as a small

4381.28 --> 4385.36
guy and if you want to have anything to

4383.639 --> 4387.92
do with you have to then work for the

4385.36 --> 4390.719
Mega Corporation that's going to treat

4387.92 --> 4393.679
you like a slave because they

4390.719 --> 4395.52
can yeah you won't get as much out of it

4393.679 --> 4397.8
you won't have the power you can't

4395.52 --> 4401.320000000001
determine where it's going to

4397.8 --> 4401.320000000001
go you can't

4402.36 --> 4405.36
compete

4406.4 --> 4411.96
Reagan administration Reagan

4408.44 --> 4411.96
administration okay yeah

4421.639 --> 4425.12
yeah that's interesting that they were

4423.92 --> 4427.679
really onto

4425.12 --> 4429.5199999999995
that hey the administrations weren't

4427.679 --> 4431.52
perfect I'm not saying like oh this

4429.52 --> 4434.76
Administration was the better one and

4431.52 --> 4437.040000000001
that one I'm just saying there were

4434.76 --> 4437.04
these

4437.56 --> 4443.320000000001
systems if company gets too big that

4441.32 --> 4446.08
they basically don't have

4443.32 --> 4448.639
to that they become completely

4446.08 --> 4452.08
independent like independent almost like

4448.639 --> 4455.92
their own mini State like that's when

4452.08 --> 4458.88
things go wrong you have to break it up

4455.92 --> 4458.88
what's wrong with Ron

4462.28 --> 4465.28
Paul

4473.679 --> 4479.88
yes that's right steamy traveler that's

4477.12 --> 4482.48
right what is the whole point of it of

4479.88 --> 4484.84
capitalism it's the

4482.48 --> 4486.839999999999
motivation yeah it's the mo it's a

4484.84 --> 4489.56
motivator if you can start something

4486.84 --> 4493.32
small and compete it's the

4489.56 --> 4495.0
motivation yeah the energy goes flowing

4493.32 --> 4499.5599999999995
that's what really makes it work that's

4495.0 --> 4499.56
why it's like the friendly competition

4499.679 --> 4505.4
effect it gets people going it gets

4502.36 --> 4508.44
their creativity going

4505.4 --> 4512.0
everything but only if they can compete

4508.44 --> 4514.919999999999
if they're like protected by the state

4512.0 --> 4514.92
to be able to

4522.199 --> 4525.199
compete

4528.0 --> 4533.6
capitalism is the only motivator no it's

4530.719 --> 4537.08
a system yeah another system is

4533.6 --> 4539.84
controlled economy is that the state

4537.08 --> 4541.4
just gives people money like you buil

4539.84 --> 4544.639
this

4541.4 --> 4547.239
business right and then they build the

4544.639 --> 4548.56
business then they own that business

4547.239 --> 4552.36
they

4548.56 --> 4554.639
become the owners of that business of of

4552.36 --> 4557.88
that market

4554.639 --> 4561.36
and then the state is like yeah you're

4557.88 --> 4564.52
going to do what we say we gave you that

4561.36 --> 4567.32
that's not really capitalism at

4564.52 --> 4570.0
all that's like a control economy where

4567.32 --> 4573.32
the state basically decides who is going

4570.0 --> 4573.32
to have what

4573.92 --> 4581.28
business by how they're going to fund

4576.88 --> 4584.12
them insert money instead of like just

4581.28 --> 4586.32
letting them make money

4584.12 --> 4588.48
and that is not capitalism anymore and

4586.32 --> 4593.36
that is a thing that has been done in

4588.48 --> 4593.36
the 21st century a lot especially by the

4596.52 --> 4602.679
US yeah they just like oh we need this

4599.84 --> 4605.0
thing giant amount of money in the

4602.679 --> 4608.08
budget boom we're going to make this

4605.0 --> 4609.92
apparatus then it forms and then oh it's

4608.08 --> 4612.08
like how the Department of Homeland

4609.92 --> 4615.08
Security came into

4612.08 --> 4615.08
being

4628.12 --> 4633.639
protected by this you know it is that is

4630.76 --> 4635.280000000001
absolutely what capitalism is protected

4633.639 --> 4639.88
by the

4635.28 --> 4639.88
state absolutely what are you talking

4642.0 --> 4645.0
about

4651.8 --> 4655.4400000000005
it's not Collective social

4653.679 --> 4659.2390000000005
responsibility at

4655.44 --> 4661.5599999999995
all specifically capitalism protects the

4659.239 --> 4664.48
entrepreneur with rights they have

4661.56 --> 4668.679
rights to appeal

4664.48 --> 4668.678999999999
to they're allowed to

4672.0 --> 4675.0
compete

4698.639 --> 4705.719
one yeah well your

4701.92 --> 4710.8
look you seem to think of capitalism as

4705.719 --> 4710.8
like the 19th century idea of

4710.92 --> 4717.04
capitalism which is just oligarchy I

4714.12 --> 4720.5199999999995
mean that is just what that was it's

4717.04 --> 4722.5199999999995
just oligarchy yeah you can have as much

4720.52 --> 4724.719
money as you want oh the more money you

4722.52 --> 4726.84
have the more you can do and you own it

4724.719 --> 4728.679
all and nobody can take it away or they

4726.84 --> 4732.159000000001
can try to steal it from you or whatever

4728.679 --> 4734.92
or black whatever yeah it's just

4732.159 --> 4734.92
oligarchy

4735.639 --> 4739.400000000001
that's what you're thinking

4737.52 --> 4741.92
of yeah

4739.4 --> 4744.96
capitalism as a

4741.92 --> 4747.28
system like that runs out then if you

4744.96 --> 4748.76
just let it turn into oligarchy then it

4747.28 --> 4751.36
just runs out it just becomes an

4748.76 --> 4753.1990000000005
oligarchy and then there is no more

4751.36 --> 4756.239
capitalism nobody's going to try

4753.199 --> 4759.36
anything new because that only happens

4756.239 --> 4762.5199999999995
if the oligarch decides it

4759.36 --> 4764.36
happens yeah no more capitalism so it

4762.52 --> 4767.400000000001
isn't

4764.36 --> 4770.96
that a durable form of capitalism

4767.4 --> 4770.96
requires anti-monopoly

4772.88 --> 4776.12
laws that's

4776.56 --> 4780.92
it that's nothing to do with

4786.19 --> 4789.58
[Music]

4791.84 --> 4794.84
democracy

4821.76 --> 4827.04
yeah

4824.4 --> 4829.5599999999995
and those laws are decided upon imposed

4827.04 --> 4829.56
by who

4834.199 --> 4838.4
exactly the government and the

4845.76 --> 4851.719
people elected

4848.4 --> 4854.48
officials well not just like

4851.719 --> 4857.4

4857.4 --> 4864.36
expecting me to roll out like some kind

4859.96 --> 4867.679

4869.36 --> 4874.5199999999995
is the problem man I'm just laying down

4872.159 --> 4878.0
some basic concept

4874.52 --> 4881.280000000001
here a democracy no it democracy has

4878.0 --> 4881.28
nothing to [ __ ] do with

4881.639 --> 4884.639
it

4884.72 --> 4887.839
[Music]

4891.48 --> 4895.678999999999

4994.52 --> 5001.4800000000005
Big Oil platforms paying Republic yep

4997.04 --> 5005.639
Republicans are like a totally corrupted

5001.48 --> 5008.5199999999995
party yeah I never said that American

5005.639 --> 5011.56
politics isn't like irredeemably

5008.52 --> 5013.76
corrupted and should be like purged and

5011.56 --> 5018.92
replaced

5013.76 --> 5023.2390000000005
entirely and like giant Secret Service

5018.92 --> 5026.36
crap networks should be routed it's so

5023.239 --> 5029.678999999999
unbelievably corrupt like it can never

5026.36 --> 5029.679
be fixed from within

5030.32 --> 5035.28
ever it can only be completely

5058.1 --> 5061.299
[Music]

5061.36 --> 5064.36
replaced

5080.119 --> 5083.4
right so what are we arguing

5085.88 --> 5093.8
about I don't get it yeah by the way

5090.48 --> 5096.5599999999995
yeah corruption

5093.8 --> 5099.84
the the just corruption in itself

5096.56 --> 5101.56
destroys any system yeah doesn't matter

5099.84 --> 5105.28
what you

5101.56 --> 5105.280000000001
do it destroys

5106.76 --> 5113.119000000001
everything whatever system you had it's

5109.679 --> 5115.28
not going to work if it's corrupted if

5113.119 --> 5117.08
the people that are carrying it out are

5115.28 --> 5120.32
not carrying it out the way you're

5117.08 --> 5123.5199999999995
supposed to do it to keep it

5120.32 --> 5125.36
functioning in favor of their own

5123.52 --> 5128.159000000001
self-enrichment yeah that's called

5125.36 --> 5131.44
corruption then it doesn't

5128.159 --> 5135.04
work whatever there is yeah monopoly

5131.44 --> 5135.04
laws not being enforced well that's

5139.84 --> 5144.96
corruption you think G Wilders well you

5143.0 --> 5147.44
can't even properly spell his name right

5144.96 --> 5150.159
and who gives a [ __ ] the guy

5147.44 --> 5154.28
is he's not so obvious establishment

5150.159 --> 5154.28
from the start call it like day one

5157.08 --> 5163.92
there's like multiple people that are

5160.28 --> 5167.199
supposedly the new wave and they're all

5163.92 --> 5170.04
WF corrupted all of them they're all

5167.199 --> 5174.28
just trying they just like not being

5170.04 --> 5176.28
super overtly [ __ ] communist about

5174.28 --> 5179.199
it

5176.28 --> 5181.679
yeah because the people that do that

5179.199 --> 5184.199
they are getting massively rejected and

5181.679 --> 5184.1990000000005
kicked out

5185.88 --> 5192.6
but I mean yeah

5187.88 --> 5192.6
Gert definitely has

5192.76 --> 5197.4400000000005
corruption he has those

5195.08 --> 5200.88
ties he's part of the

5197.44 --> 5203.839999999999
cabal of the newer generation of cabal

5200.88 --> 5207.719
the ones that aren't just straight out

5203.84 --> 5209.8
puked out yeah because the elite is

5207.719 --> 5212.84
completely failing no matter who they're

5209.8 --> 5214.96
going to put forward like the control

5212.84 --> 5217.159000000001
itself is being rejected it doesn't

5214.96 --> 5220.08
matter how it's presented anymore

5217.159 --> 5220.08
they're utterly

5230.48 --> 5234.44
failing so which what the [ __ ] are you

5233.4 --> 5237.239
talking

5234.44 --> 5239.4
about you just keep on blabbering and

5237.239 --> 5244.119
blabbering and moving to other things

5239.4 --> 5244.119
like what the what are you doing here

5247.199 --> 5253.4
what the [ __ ] does good generation have

5249.52 --> 5253.400000000001
to do with anything we were talking

5263.92 --> 5267.079
[Music]

5271.119 --> 5274.119
about

5331.6 --> 5335.92
or maybe he's run out maybe's run out of

5334.48 --> 5339.36
breath that's

5335.92 --> 5339.36
good okay move

5341.87 --> 5346.159
[Music]

5360.92 --> 5363.92
on

5365.05 --> 5368.119000000001
[Music]

5381.04 --> 5385.44
all right so I don't know what the [ __ ]

5382.96 --> 5387.6
this all this whiny stuff is about I

5385.44 --> 5390.919999999999
don't even know like why

5387.6 --> 5393.92
I what am I debating about with this

5390.92 --> 5393.92
guy

5396.8 --> 5400.679
I don't even understand like what his

5398.48 --> 5403.199
point is I've just been trying to

5400.679 --> 5406.32
explain like yeah Monopoly Law

5403.199 --> 5408.5599999999995
requires is required for capitalism to

5406.32 --> 5408.5599999999995
keep

5409.199 --> 5415.239
working and he's like no then it's not

5413.159 --> 5419.4
capitalism yeah

5415.239 --> 5423.839999999999
well then it's going to die every

5419.4 --> 5423.839999999999
time if Monopoly can form

5424.44 --> 5430.28
then they can

5427.0 --> 5434.04
literally eventually just bypass loss

5430.28 --> 5436.08
they can just buy their way out of it

5434.04 --> 5439.88
and then it's not capitalism anymore and

5436.08 --> 5442.84
then people can't compete no competition

5439.88 --> 5442.84
possible no

5446.719 --> 5453.28
capitalism if I had the money dude I

5450.119 --> 5455.839999999999
don't know steamy I have absolutely no

5453.28 --> 5455.84
freaking

5456.48 --> 5463.159
idea even when I did have have the money

5460.04 --> 5466.36
I had no idea and that's why I don't

5463.159 --> 5468.4
have the money anymore cuz I had no idea

5466.36 --> 5470.679
what to actually do with it I couldn't

5468.4 --> 5472.92
think of something that I could make

5470.679 --> 5476.52
work in my

5472.92 --> 5480.76
mind so I don't know I didn't know that

5476.52 --> 5483.51
20 years ago and I don't know it

5480.76 --> 5486.6
now

5483.51 --> 5486.6
[Music]

5488.159 --> 5492.638999999999
you don't completely why don't you

5490.44 --> 5496.759999999999
completely understand my point debatable

5492.639 --> 5499.36
D I spent like half an hour just

5496.76 --> 5501.320000000001
repeating the same message over and over

5499.36 --> 5506.36
how can you not understand what I've

5501.32 --> 5506.36
been communicating to you are you

5510.76 --> 5513.76
thick

5540.679 --> 5543.679
for

5544.52 --> 5550.360000000001
maybe don't repeat well maybe

5547.36 --> 5550.36
respond

5551.199 --> 5557.5199999999995
then find another way to you're a

5563.04 --> 5569.76
nuts you can't get your point across oh

5565.96 --> 5572.92
really well you did and your point

5569.76 --> 5575.6
was it's not capital capitalism if

5572.92 --> 5577.52
monopolies are broken up well goodbye

5575.6 --> 5582.1990000000005
capitalism then that's my point you

5577.52 --> 5584.76
don't seem to be receiving anything from

5582.199 --> 5586.678999999999
my communication about it though could

5584.76 --> 5589.76
just ignore

5586.679 --> 5594.8
everything that's what I'm noticing

5589.76 --> 5594.8
yeah I can't find any other way to

5595.4 --> 5602.5599999999995
communicate goodby Capital yeah that's

5597.76 --> 5607.08
right so not capitalism then

5602.56 --> 5610.8
if yeah monopoly laws aren't enforced

5607.08 --> 5614.199
not capitalism then that was my entire

5610.8 --> 5617.360000000001
point in this last half hour is it

5614.199 --> 5617.36
finally getting through to

5618.08 --> 5624.96
you no not let's get rid of capitalism

5621.199 --> 5628.799999999999
there is no capitalism it's not there if

5624.96 --> 5628.8
you can't compete it's not

5630.56 --> 5633.56
capitalism

5636.84 --> 5639.360000000001
it's an

5640.0 --> 5643.36
oligarchy not

5646.76 --> 5651.2390000000005
capitalism oh yeah all caps maybe

5649.159 --> 5653.32
that'll help oh winky face oh yeah

5651.239 --> 5656.32
that's going to help you prevent being

5653.32 --> 5656.32
banned for

5656.84 --> 5661.159000000001
sure you're not giving me an incentive

5828.0 --> 5831.04
what we've been bickering about with

this

5831.04 --> 5838.639
[ __ ] for over half an

that

5850.44 --> 5856.678999999999
[Music]

5853.52 --> 5860.0
simple do interviews make me nervous

5856.679 --> 5860.0
nope not

5861.199 --> 5866.239
really or you mean job interviews yeah

5863.96 --> 5870.199
they well they don't yeah they do make

5866.239 --> 5872.199
me nervous I just don't really do it

5870.199 --> 5875.4
anymore

5872.199 --> 5880.239
I've had like serious depression

5875.4 --> 5880.239
meltdowns over [ __ ] trying

5880.639 --> 5884.32
to do job

5900.119 --> 5903.119
interviews

5918.84 --> 5924.1990000000005
okay that can't be

5921.639 --> 5926.679
good right anyway two minute break I'll

5924.199 --> 5926.678999999999
be right

5930.119 --> 5933.119
back

5990.04 --> 5993.04
for

6045.8 --> 6048.2390000000005
and I'm

6049.92 --> 6052.92
back

6068.28 --> 6070.96

[Music]

6129.44 --> 6134.598999999999
yeah duper next time if you have a job

6131.599 --> 6137.679
interview and it's classified don't tell

6134.599 --> 6137.679
us about it

6139.76 --> 6142.76
yeah

6150.3 --> 6153.39
[Music]

6169.76 --> 6172.76

[Music]

6208.88 --> 6211.719
that all depends

6229.679 --> 6232.679
duper

6251.639 --> 6257.679
what did you catch him at a troll

6254.88 --> 6259.599
video cuz otherwise I don't really care

6257.679 --> 6262.599
to

6259.599 --> 6262.599
know

6289.56 --> 6292.56
right

6305.52 --> 6308.88
all right so yeah let's move

6310.76 --> 6313.939
[Music]

6319.48 --> 6322.48
on

6349.48 --> 6352.48
h

6356.84 --> 6363.28
it's more than that what that he has a

6360.04 --> 6366.28
criminal record or something yeah I

6363.28 --> 6366.28
know

6366.599 --> 6370.639
whatever you don't want to start it

6368.8 --> 6372.8
sounds like you do want to start a

6370.639 --> 6377.0
dumpster fire duper pun it sounds like

6372.8 --> 6377.0
that's exactly what you want to do right

6379.4 --> 6387.0
now

6381.8 --> 6387.0
modal oh so it's completely pointless

6402.119 --> 6408.719
then yes that's exactly right blue build

6406.4 --> 6412.4
Evolution yeah you summarized that

6408.719 --> 6412.4
better than I could have

6413.92 --> 6422.4800000000005
I mean I like to correct people I like

6418.719 --> 6425.32
to actually I'm kind of like that but

6422.48 --> 6427.4
the thing is when I do it I actually

6425.32 --> 6430.88
want to have a good point that can be

6427.4 --> 6432.638999999999
taken and carried on yeah not just I

6430.88 --> 6435.0
just have to correct you and then not

6432.639 --> 6435.0
have a

6435.4 --> 6442.239
point like that's the worst if you're

6437.599 --> 6443.8
going to correct somebody have a point

6442.239 --> 6445.44
if you don't have a point then why would

6443.8 --> 6449.0
you correct

6445.44 --> 6449.0
anything it's just

6455.08 --> 6459.719
disruption yeah and I mean what the hell

6457.719 --> 6463.4
was his

6459.719 --> 6464.679
point if you force monopoly laws it's

6463.4 --> 6466.32
not

6464.679 --> 6468.679
capitalism

6466.32 --> 6471.28
uh it's only capitalism when you don't

6468.679 --> 6473.0
enforce them and then if it will destroy

6471.28 --> 6477.36
itself and it won't be capitalism

6473.0 --> 6480.119
anymore yay so how did any of that make

6477.36 --> 6483.799999999999
any damn sense basically arguing for

6480.119 --> 6485.639
like yeah capitalism is

6483.8 --> 6489.08
impossible

6485.639 --> 6491.599
okay uh well it isn't if you force

6489.08 --> 6491.599
monopoly

6492.199 --> 6495.4
laws you

6497.04 --> 6503.56
know hey LSG good to see you to come up

6500.8 --> 6503.56
with an article

6504.639 --> 6509.52
mile that's to do with Celestial

6517.52 --> 6524.0
angles right that's what that's based on

6521.48 --> 6528.0
that's that's it I'm not if you want to

6524.0 --> 6532.84
know the details about that ask Brian's

6528.0 --> 6532.84
logic you'll do a 20 minutes video about

6534.14 --> 6541.08
[Music]

6553.159 --> 6558.4
it can you

6555.52 --> 6561.56
explain Celestial angles like how

6558.4 --> 6566.0
navigation works it's like

6561.56 --> 6570.4800000000005
this many degrees over that much

6566.0 --> 6573.52
distance so it's like degrees of Polaris

6570.48 --> 6577.08
shift this much distance I think that

6573.52 --> 6577.080000000001
that's where nautical mile came

6577.719 --> 6583.52
from might be wrong but I think that

6580.28 --> 6586.199
that was kind of what it

6583.52 --> 6587.84
is these videos are yeah hey while

6586.199 --> 6591.969999999999
you're asking complicated questions

6587.84 --> 6598.509
you're going to get complicated answers

6591.97 --> 6598.509
[Music]

6600.72 --> 6603.839
[Music]

6613.52 --> 6617.2390000000005
but I think that what I just explained

6615.28 --> 6620.36
is pretty much

6617.239 --> 6623.199
it the nautical miles like the other

6620.36 --> 6627.5599999999995
form of measurement of the Earth has to

6623.199 --> 6631.36
do with star angle based

6627.56 --> 6634.119000000001
distances that's how those other form of

6631.36 --> 6636.44
measurement is done they measure the

6634.119 --> 6638.4
angles of the celestials instead of

6636.44 --> 6643.0
actual distances on

6638.4 --> 6643.0
Earth it's just you use the other

6649.04 --> 6654.36
thing it's about as simple as I can

6651.96 --> 6654.36
explain

6678.96 --> 6681.96
it

6708.96 --> 6711.96
h

6719.4 --> 6725.04
hey was there actual live

6721.639 --> 6725.04
Fed was it a

6728.719 --> 6733.96
Premiere no it was streamed live so I

6731.28 --> 6738.88
guess Nathan's made his computer work

6733.96 --> 6741.88
again or is us to backup or something

6738.88 --> 6741.88
h

6742.44 --> 6745.919999999999
oh God Flat Earth Beast the

6747.04 --> 6751.36
nonsense a little about how latitudes

6749.56 --> 6754.280000000001
are derived from elevation angles and

6751.36 --> 6755.759999999999
she saw it how it makes good yeah that's

6754.28 --> 6758.92
that's what you need to do like that's

6755.76 --> 6762.4400000000005
the like oh we know the Earth is flat

6758.92 --> 6765.8
now let's get into nonsense like ether

6762.44 --> 6769.0
and how the Moon is a reflection of the

6765.8 --> 6771.719
Earth Map right while there is so much

6769.0 --> 6775.0
more detail to

6771.719 --> 6777.36
learn like all that [ __ ] is all just

6775.0 --> 6781.04
Fantastical Feasta nonsense distraction

6777.36 --> 6785.36
while learning exactly how these systems

6781.04 --> 6787.56
work like latitudes and all that like

6785.36 --> 6791.48
it's kind of important to know the

6787.56 --> 6793.92
details about that of like why it is the

6791.48 --> 6795.959999999999
way it is how they were established even

6793.92 --> 6800.639
just to figure out

6795.96 --> 6803.52
like what do we actually know

6800.639 --> 6806.36
yeah in order to know what you actually

6803.52 --> 6809.92
know you have to know that what you are

6806.36 --> 6813.079
using and what has been used how that

6809.92 --> 6816.599
works and then you can figure out like

6813.079 --> 6819.4
hey has this all been done properly are

6816.599 --> 6822.32
there any unforeseen unaddressed issues

6819.4 --> 6823.799999999999
within the making of all these things

6822.32 --> 6827.199
like the

6823.8 --> 6829.119000000001
maps and yeah there are a lot of issues

6827.199 --> 6831.48
and the more you learn about how it's

6829.119 --> 6833.96
made and how Celestial navigation works

6831.48 --> 6835.718999999999
and how map making works the more you

6833.96 --> 6838.4800000000005
start to figure out

6835.719 --> 6840.92
like

6838.48 --> 6843.919999999999
uh there's a lot of things we don't

6840.92 --> 6846.96
really have certainty about

6843.92 --> 6850.76
here I mean these are all very

6846.96 --> 6853.36
consistent map projections in ways but I

6850.76 --> 6856.119000000001
mean you don't really know if the

6853.36 --> 6858.679
orientation of everything is really the

6856.119 --> 6861.679
way that it

6858.679 --> 6861.679
seems

6862.599 --> 6865.719
all right yeah see you later

6870.239 --> 6876.159
duper Polaris is in the middle of a p

6873.239 --> 6878.119
yeah no but that's exactly the physical

6876.159 --> 6881.5199999999995
assumption

6878.119 --> 6884.639
bias that will make you reify the map

6881.52 --> 6886.599
projection that is polaric Centric into

6884.639 --> 6889.719
the literal thing when it obviously

6886.599 --> 6891.079
isn't since everything on the map of the

6889.719 --> 6894.88
dis

6891.079 --> 6898.799999999999
map is of an inconsistent

6894.88 --> 6902.56
scale so that can't be the real thing

6898.8 --> 6905.52
then I mean that is what it

6902.56 --> 6909.159000000001
is yeah if you have a map and one part

6905.52 --> 6911.679
of the map is not consistent in its

6909.159 --> 6916.4
scale representation with another part

6911.679 --> 6918.599
of the map then it's not the real thing

6916.4 --> 6920.719
it's very simple

6918.599 --> 6923.639
right

6920.719 --> 6927.4
just because the projection centers it

6923.639 --> 6931.599
around Polaris doesn't mean that Polaris

6927.4 --> 6931.598999999999
literally is the center point of the

6942.09 --> 6946.999
[Music]

6948.599 --> 6951.599
realm

6961.86 --> 6966.478999999999

for

6991.86 --> 6995.04
[Music]

6996.719 --> 7001.4
yeah and duper you are right I am going

6998.84 --> 7005.360000000001

kicking

7068.4 --> 7071.4
out

7071.76 --> 7074.84
the Slimmer the

7075.239 --> 7082.5599999999995
better like the less viewers that

7078.32 --> 7082.5599999999995
actually make it to see my show the

7083.36 --> 7089.239
better CU I want

7439.599 --> 7445.76
really

7441.079 --> 7445.759999999999

7446.84 --> 7452.599
robots I mean I've been a little bit in

7449.92 --> 7456.2390000000005
the cleaning business when I was younger

7452.599 --> 7459.400000000001
and like it was just

7456.239 --> 7462.239
terrible cuz I like good thorough

7459.4 --> 7464.679
cleaning but I tried to work for one of

7462.239 --> 7466.32
them and they were literally

7464.679 --> 7469.4800000000005
complaining

7466.32 --> 7471.639
about this is like I did it too well

7469.48 --> 7475.0
seriously they would literally take me

7471.639 --> 7477.84
apart like yeah we can't we can't extra

7475.0 --> 7480.88
because you're taking too much time

7477.84 --> 7482.639
doing this and I'm like yeah I'm

7480.88 --> 7486.84
actually cleaning it

7482.639 --> 7489.28
up and not just uh uh uh oh I did the

7486.84 --> 7491.4400000000005
thing I'm contractually bound to to do

7489.28 --> 7493.679
and now I'm moving on like no I am

7491.44 --> 7498.159
actually trying to clean it and they

7493.679 --> 7498.159
were like yeah sorry we can't

7498.84 --> 7503.719
dude that was a

7501.079 --> 7505.639
nightmare like there's just people they

7503.719 --> 7506.96
just pretend to be cleaners and they

7505.639 --> 7509.52
just do something that's in their

7506.96 --> 7513.559
contract they don't give a [ __ ] if it's

7509.52 --> 7513.559
actually clean or not like that was

7517.679 --> 7520.679
terrible

7523.199 --> 7526.839999999999

7525.04 --> 7529.28
becoming a professional cleaner I can

7526.84 --> 7529.28
tell you

7529.36 --> 7535.36
that like what's the point of getting

7532.599 --> 7537.4400000000005
paid to clean stuff when you're don't

7535.36 --> 7541.558999999999
where you're not actually allowed to

7537.44 --> 7541.558999999999
properly clean it I mean that's just

7545.199 --> 7550.678999999999

7676.719 --> 7680.4800000000005
spoiled by city

7682.4 --> 7688.36
life I'm too loose I'm not disciplined

7685.239 --> 7692.0
enough I I'm not stoic enough I don't

7688.36 --> 7694.239
have like a personal continual labor

7692.0 --> 7696.8
tradition which is really essential in

7694.239 --> 7700.44
the Amish you don't have work like

7696.8 --> 7700.4400000000005
you're completely used

7704.04 --> 7713.4
less would have to shave it what what

7708.0 --> 7713.4
why would is do they shave mustaches the

7713.52 --> 7719.040000000001
Amish huh but I can't grow a beard so

7716.4 --> 7719.04
that's not going to

7723.04 --> 7727.32
work so that's just not going to

7727.4 --> 7733.199
happen

7730.36 --> 7736.759999999999
independent not willing to give up on

7733.199 --> 7739.239
technology I'd have much less trouble

7736.76 --> 7739.2390000000005
with that

7742.199 --> 7748.44
part I mean I'd really enjoy being

7745.52 --> 7751.079000000001
around Amish just because they're not

7748.44 --> 7754.44
all staring in their [ __ ] little

7751.079 --> 7756.239
mobile all day long yeah just for that

7754.44 --> 7758.719
alone just like being around people that

7756.239 --> 7761.48
are actually looking around like be

7758.719 --> 7765.4800000000005
trying to find other people's eyes would

7761.48 --> 7765.48
be like a blessing to

7768.559 --> 7776.8
me the arish use

7771.96 --> 7779.0
Tech very limited it's more like the

7776.8 --> 7782.76
representatives or the ones that deal

7779.0 --> 7786.679
with the outside world for business they

7782.76 --> 7789.119000000001
have to have some tech it's just in the

7786.679 --> 7793.04
inner grounds

7789.119 --> 7795.96
on Amish land you don't have

7793.04 --> 7798.559
Tech but I mean the business guy that's

7795.96 --> 7802.04
going to go out of town do business yeah

7798.559 --> 7806.4800000000005
they'll probably have a mobile phone

7802.04 --> 7811.199
right but that's only

7806.48 --> 7811.199
outside on the premise they don't have

7817.239 --> 7820.239
that

7834.84 --> 7837.1990000000005
oh

7838.28 --> 7842.84
okay Amish made Furniture

7847.239 --> 7850.239
cool

7856.95 --> 7868.229
[Music]

7877.159 --> 7881.36
h

7879.639 --> 7883.719
they're well known for their Furniture

7881.36 --> 7887.04
skills yeah well hey if you like don't

7883.719 --> 7888.92
develop in all their Technologies then

7887.04 --> 7894.76
the

7888.92 --> 7894.76
classic things will work best right just

7895.6 --> 7900.52
[Music]

7898.079 --> 7902.239
Woodworking and they do have blacksmiths

7900.52 --> 7905.4800000000005
too right it's not like they don't even

7902.239 --> 7905.48
use steel or

7906.96 --> 7910.159
anything right

7926.32 --> 7933.5199999999995
it's like they could build those things

7928.719 --> 7933.52
they just refus to have like combustion

7937.079 --> 7941.599
systems but I mean you'll be I'll be

7939.599 --> 7943.119000000001
damn sure they'll be using like rocket

7941.599 --> 7947.360000000001
stoves and all

7943.119 --> 7950.759999999999
that just Advanced basic systems because

7947.36 --> 7953.92
you can advance the basic system so

7950.76 --> 7959.04
far like we're not really dependent on

7953.92 --> 7959.04
all this new tech [ __ ] like we really

7960.52 --> 7967.599
aren't only people that think that the

7964.28 --> 7968.759999999999
old Technologies like are outdated and

7967.599 --> 7971.8
bad and

7968.76 --> 7973.77
useless will think that they really need

7971.8 --> 7976.2390000000005
the new tech or they

7973.77 --> 7982.2390000000005
[Music]

7976.239 --> 7982.239
don't old Tech is good it's very

7985.32 --> 7990.679
efficient yeah modern tech breeds

7987.88 --> 7990.679
laziness and

7996.96 --> 7999.96
delusion

8011.28 --> 8017.679
right yeah de do everything for you will

8014.599 --> 8017.679
be the downfall of a

8017.96 --> 8020.96
soul

8021.44 --> 8029.96
right yeah I know derer first

8026.119 --> 8029.96
test Maybe

8030.199 --> 8033.0
first test

8033.52 --> 8037.96
officially but yeah I mean there's like

8036.159 --> 8040.119
long-term problems I already addressed

8037.96 --> 8042.52
this subject two days

8040.119 --> 8046.0
ago with the brain implants what is the

8042.52 --> 8047.92
long-term issues with that like what

8046.0 --> 8050.44
does he want out of

8047.92 --> 8052.04
it I did a full roll out and that's

8050.44 --> 8056.079
going to stand the test of time it's

8052.04 --> 8056.079
among our Winan prediction list

8056.88 --> 8059.88
so

8083.4 --> 8088.639999999999

8093.239 --> 8098.32
really evil he's a business guy and he

8095.48 --> 8100.678999999999
wants to be the the breaker of the

8098.32 --> 8103.239
market he wants to have a new

8100.679 --> 8106.2390000000005
ground to break open with and he thinks

8103.239 --> 8110.239
it's that and he thinks that through his

8106.239 --> 8113.839999999999
brain chips and this is it is there I

8110.239 --> 8117.4
mean it's going to happen that basically

8113.84 --> 8118.639
unexpected superpowers can be like

8117.4 --> 8121.799999999999
unlocked

8118.639 --> 8124.76
doing that sort of thing it's just that

8121.8 --> 8127.679
once that starts to become like a thing

8124.76 --> 8130.639
and the people that want it it's just

8127.679 --> 8134.04
the same like with every other invasive

8130.639 --> 8135.8
thing like super drugs like oh there's

8134.04 --> 8138.679
the super drug it could really do this

8135.8 --> 8142.0
for you and you're like oh be all that

8138.679 --> 8144.1990000000005
yeah what's the price you know because

8142.0 --> 8146.04
even if you don't have some drug flowing

8144.199 --> 8149.48
through your veins to do that if you

8146.04 --> 8151.599
have an implant that's causing something

8149.48 --> 8154.119
and you have heavy activity including

8151.599 --> 8156.079
rain activity it's like there's a lot of

8154.119 --> 8158.558999999999
energy going through your system and

8156.079 --> 8160.28
there's this thing in the way that's

8158.559 --> 8163.92
kind of like forcing how it works so

8160.28 --> 8166.88
either it won't you'll get the range

8163.92 --> 8168.599
manifestation or scarring will build up

8166.88 --> 8171.599
and then suddenly nothing functions

8168.599 --> 8171.599
anymore

8171.639 --> 8177.96
like it will burn itself out just like

8175.92 --> 8180.159
people that go on too many drugs they

8177.96 --> 8182.0
burn themselves out and so will brain

8180.159 --> 8183.48
chips they might like unlock some kind

8182.0 --> 8186.44
of superpowers that are kind of

8183.48 --> 8188.718999999999
mysterious and fascinating and all that

8186.44 --> 8190.32
unlock potential of the human body like

8188.719 --> 8192.24
studies after that have already been

8190.32 --> 8195.84
done even like with

8192.24 --> 8198.08
animals just like H what if you trigger

8195.84 --> 8200.559
this what if you trigger

8198.08 --> 8204.039999999999
that but the problem is is that yeah

8200.559 --> 8207.24
whatever your implant is going to be

8204.04 --> 8210.599
like if you're like wanting to manifest

8207.24 --> 8213.199999999999
in a big way using it having heavy

8210.599 --> 8215.719000000001
activity you're going to have scarring

8213.2 --> 8217.76
issues it's going to keep building it's

8215.719 --> 8220.839999999998
not going to because it's not

8217.76 --> 8224.28
holistic it's not supposed to be there

8220.84 --> 8228.479
low activity however that's fine it's

8224.28 --> 8231.92
like oh I'm wheelchair bound my back was

8228.479 --> 8233.96
damaged and I need this thing to like

8231.92 --> 8236.76
reroute the connection and then I can

8233.96 --> 8239.639
use it again right well that's a

8236.76 --> 8242.479
relatively simp Le Invasion and it is

8239.639 --> 8246.319
the restoration of something that's

8242.479 --> 8249.358999999999
damaged that's much more doable and

8246.319 --> 8252.76
durable compared to like I want

8249.359 --> 8255.880000000001
something new something abnormal that I

8252.76 --> 8259.0
can do with this chip and then oh I'm

8255.88 --> 8262.8
going to get all invested into

8259.0 --> 8265.319
that that's going to mess him up I mean

8262.8 --> 8266.599
I roughly predict that the people that

8265.319 --> 8269.439
are doing

8266.599 --> 8270.2
that they're all going to drop dead at

8269.439 --> 8273.880000000001
some

8270.2 --> 8276.240000000002
point because either because of scarring

8273.88 --> 8278.319
that just builds up because of the

8276.24 --> 8280.08
implant and then it doesn't function

8278.319 --> 8281.76
anymore and then you become like

8280.08 --> 8285.559
mentally handicapped or

8281.76 --> 8288.16
something or like they become so remote

8285.559 --> 8291.279999999999
so disconnected socially from the world

8288.16 --> 8293.639
because of it that they just like become

8291.28 --> 8296.479000000001
completely alienated and at some point

8293.639 --> 8298.199999999999
just by accident commit suicide without

8296.479 --> 8300.08
even realizing it

8298.2 --> 8301.960000000001
like suddenly stepping in front of a bus

8300.08 --> 8304.28
or just suddenly walking off a bridge

8301.96 --> 8306.88
and not realize that they were doing

8304.28 --> 8310.92
that

8306.88 --> 8312.639
so he wants to corner a new market but

8310.92 --> 8316.04
it's going to have

8312.639 --> 8316.039999999999
casualties a lot of

8318.309 --> 8322.279999999999
[Music]

8320.319 --> 8325.8
them

8322.28 --> 8327.960000000001
yeah what can't happen however is oh

8325.8 --> 8330.599
everybody in the world can have an

8327.96 --> 8333.438999999998
implant we're now a high mind no that

8330.599 --> 8335.76
just means you're all going to die very

8333.439 --> 8338.479000000001
quickly it's not going to

8335.76 --> 8340.800000000001
last especially if there's some weird

8338.479 --> 8343.599
bork situation going on where you have

8340.8 --> 8346.039999999999
an interface with a giant web of people

8343.599 --> 8348.76
that like unnaturally communicates to

8346.04 --> 8353.04
you continually like you're going to

8348.76 --> 8356.84
burn out unnatural heavy activity that

8353.04 --> 8357.960000000001
is not stoppable whatever energies

8356.84 --> 8360.24
running High

8357.96 --> 8362.88
scarring forming like it's just going to

8360.24 --> 8365.96
crumble very

8362.88 --> 8369.96
quickly it can't

8365.96 --> 8371.8
last if you have that resistance is

8369.96 --> 8375.759999999998
futile

8371.8 --> 8375.759999999998
sure but then you

8376.2 --> 8382.359
die yeah you don't go or we are the B

8380.2 --> 8385.12
you shall be assimilated walking around

8382.359 --> 8386.439
for like 40 years no no no after five

8385.12 --> 8388.2
years

8386.439 --> 8390.64
is

8388.2 --> 8390.640000000001
and it's

8396.0 --> 8408.92
[Music]

8406.04 --> 8411.240000000002
over duper could you please stop talking

8408.92 --> 8413.439
like that it's just

8411.24 --> 8416.359
stupid is that from

8413.439 --> 8419.24
RoboCop

8416.359 --> 8421.68
probably

8419.24 --> 8422.68
what now resistance is futile is from

8421.68 --> 8427.880000000001
Star

8422.68 --> 8431.6
Trek Voyager and Next Generation the Bor

8427.88 --> 8433.759999999998
not RoboCop now re now what you're

8431.6 --> 8436.479000000001
talking about RoboCop that's the the the

8433.76 --> 8436.479
Droid and he

8437.76 --> 8442.479
says like put down your weapon you have

8440.6 --> 8444.640000000001
20 seconds to

8442.479 --> 8446.319
comply that's what they

8444.64 --> 8448.92
[Music]

8446.319 --> 8451.359
say

8448.92 --> 8451.359
that's from

8453.52 --> 8459.720000000001
Roba put down your weapon you have 20

8456.92 --> 8459.72
seconds to

8466.44 --> 8469.53
[Music]

8474.76 --> 8480.64
comply your dad was bummed you wor to

8477.479 --> 8480.64
start rman oh

8482.76 --> 8490.72
okay I sounded like Sean connory

8485.88 --> 8490.72
pretending to be at okay

8492.88 --> 8497.64
thanks if Sean connory does do a little

8495.84 --> 8499.880000000001
bit of this

8497.64 --> 8502.92
sometimes he does do something weird

8499.88 --> 8504.759999999998
with his mouth kind of doesn't he I I

8502.92 --> 8506.68
get why you think that sounded like Sean

8504.76 --> 8508.800000000001
connory it's still weird to hear that

8506.68 --> 8510.92
though

8508.8 --> 8515.399
I don't think Sean connory was even a

8510.92 --> 8515.399
guy that did voices or something like

8519.76 --> 8526.459
[Music]

8528.83 --> 8531.899
[Music]

8536.16 --> 8539.16
that

8550.62 --> 8555.999000000002
[Music]

8559.96 --> 8565.72
right but I mean old Star Trek the

8563.359 --> 8568.319
Original Series is kind of interesting

8565.72 --> 8571.96
at points it's really silly

8568.319 --> 8575.6
too and it's obviously very squirty like

8571.96 --> 8577.479
o aliens oh where's the chick that the

8575.6 --> 8581.16
captain's going to have sex with

8577.479 --> 8584.88
obviously right it's kind of squirty but

8581.16 --> 8584.88
I mean they had like this whole

8585.399 --> 8590.519999999999
episode I think it was Star Trek or was

8588.2 --> 8592.359
the Next Generation I'm not even sure

8590.52 --> 8594.04
anymore which one it was I thought it

8592.359 --> 8595.479000000001
was the original series where they

8594.04 --> 8597.880000000001
basically

8595.479 --> 8601.88
address spatial

8597.88 --> 8604.56
looping like as a concept now that is

8601.88 --> 8607.438999999998
weird to bump into that

8604.56 --> 8609.88
like a century

8607.439 --> 8613.2
later like

8609.88 --> 8614.399
what wait what are they trying to

8613.2 --> 8617.0
explain

8614.399 --> 8620.399
here holy

8617.0 --> 8623.359
[ __ ] which also leads me to believe that

8620.399 --> 8628.08
look I'm probably not that far off with

8623.359 --> 8631.08
my spatial looping about the realm and

8628.08 --> 8635.56
to assume that nobody has ever figured

8631.08 --> 8637.76
it out before is kind of

8635.56 --> 8641.92
ridiculous and there's

8637.76 --> 8645.56
a bigger chance that simply they figured

8641.92 --> 8649.56
out like this is so weird there is just

8645.56 --> 8652.039999999999
no way we could ever like make it

8649.56 --> 8653.64
acceptable for the average human mind no

8652.04 --> 8654.439
matter where we're going it's like it's

8653.64 --> 8658.88
too

8654.439 --> 8661.56
surreal so we just can't say that

8658.88 --> 8665.24
except maybe H to it within science

8661.56 --> 8667.399
fiction things to be like oh maybe

8665.24 --> 8670.72
you'll kind of get

8667.399 --> 8672.84
this maybe kind of and then oh it's just

8670.72 --> 8675.479
a fantasy thing if somebody's like what

8672.84 --> 8679.72
the hell was that

8675.479 --> 8682.08
about right so I think that the realm is

8679.72 --> 8686.399
looping east to west at least and in

8682.08 --> 8687.52
other ways perhaps I think that it was

8686.399 --> 8691.039999999999
figured out

8687.52 --> 8694.84
out that that's the

8691.04 --> 8697.279
case like I'm pretty damn sure that uh

8694.84 --> 8700.52
admirable bird who supposedly explored

8697.279 --> 8703.720000000001
Antarctica went supposedly claimed to be

8700.52 --> 8707.640000000001
going around the whole thing explored

8703.72 --> 8710.92
all of it he would have had kept

8707.64 --> 8713.64
orientation not just Celestial wise he

8710.92 --> 8715.88
would have actually like hey how are we

8713.64 --> 8720.56
actually moving through

8715.88 --> 8723.119999999999
space how do the star and Sun position

8720.56 --> 8725.72
then correlate to like how we are moving

8723.12 --> 8728.439
through space and he probably figured

8725.72 --> 8730.679999999998
out like wait we are act I believe he

8728.439 --> 8732.319
didn't go in a circle I believe he just

8730.68 --> 8735.439
went in the straight line ended up in

8732.319 --> 8738.479
the same place eventually and it took

8735.439 --> 8741.800000000001
decades potentially that

8738.479 --> 8744.358999999999
travel I don't think he went around the

8741.8 --> 8747.399
realm I think he just went over the

8744.359 --> 8750.479000000001
plateau and kept going

8747.399 --> 8752.96
and then ended up at the same

8750.479 --> 8756.039999999999
location not going in a circle but in a

8752.96 --> 8757.399
straight line and then like realized

8756.04 --> 8762.359
like

8757.399 --> 8762.358999999999
yeah there's something really weird

8762.72 --> 8768.96
here like the only way you could explain

8765.08 --> 8772.399
this is like yeah it's looping like this

8768.96 --> 8774.479
is connected to that even though you go

8772.399 --> 8779.439
there in a straight line

8774.479 --> 8779.438999999998
like we can't make this logic make

8781.16 --> 8786.279
sense

8782.72 --> 8788.08
like as is unless there's a loop like

8786.279 --> 8790.68
there's a wormhole or something that

8788.08 --> 8793.52
might have had some preliminary ideas

8790.68 --> 8795.08
about that sort of thing around Einstein

8793.52 --> 8798.0
you

8795.08 --> 8800.88
know but maybe Ein Einstein was kind of

8798.0 --> 8801.88
like after that after Admiral bird

8800.88 --> 8805.8
wasn't

8801.88 --> 8808.8
he that he became more

8805.8 --> 8808.8
prominent

8814.6 --> 8820.56
do think of the sure stranger things

8816.68 --> 8820.56
it's not exactly new stuff

8820.8 --> 8825.64
clutch The Stranger Things has a very

8823.279 --> 8827.359
interesting Dark World Experience there

8825.64 --> 8828.358999999999
I like it I like their dark world is

8827.359 --> 8831.399000000001
pretty

8828.359 --> 8834.359
cool like it feels a lot like my Dark

8831.399 --> 8835.479
World experience in ways it's just much

8834.359 --> 8837.56
more

8835.479 --> 8839.64
solidified so it is much more

8837.56 --> 8842.92
reminescent of like a Dungeons and

8839.64 --> 8844.399
dragon style Shadow realm the shadow

8842.92 --> 8847.24
realm which is like exactly like the

8844.399 --> 8849.119999999999
physical normal realm except with slight

8847.24 --> 8851.52
alterations and I thought that they

8849.12 --> 8853.92
expressed it pretty well also I liked

8851.52 --> 8856.16
all the 80s references because I'm just

8853.92 --> 8859.479
like am from the

8856.16 --> 8861.84
80s and the rest is like

8859.479 --> 8865.679999999998
yeah

8861.84 --> 8868.68
okay annoying Soviet theme in last

8865.68 --> 8868.68
seasons

8869.56 --> 8875.76
MK Ultra stuff and super power

8873.52 --> 8878.479000000001
unlocked like it's all kinds of

8875.76 --> 8881.72
different themes and it's like yeah it

8878.479 --> 8884.72
was it was interesting when I watched

8881.72 --> 8886.76
it and I like their Dark World things

8884.72 --> 8888.88
especially like portals where you go

8886.76 --> 8892.2
upward and then you fall

8888.88 --> 8895.64
down like a Mirror Universe day like

8892.2 --> 8897.92
that was cool things in there that were

8895.64 --> 8901.519999999999
successfully

8897.92 --> 8903.16
done very Dungeons and Dragons like

8901.52 --> 8906.560000000001
right there was like even the theme they

8903.16 --> 8908.56
were playing that as a group of kids so

8906.56 --> 8911.689999999999
yeah I kind of liked it

8908.56 --> 8911.689999999999
[Music]

8911.76 --> 8918.399
overall but uh I mean it's not like wow

8915.92 --> 8920.76
I got to see that again it's like yeah I

8918.399 --> 8924.68
know that was okay that was

8920.76 --> 8924.68
cool but let's move

8925.6 --> 8928.6
on

8932.24 --> 8936.199999999999
2015 is to now is

8936.76 --> 8943.84
New D yeah clutch I

8940.72 --> 8946.039999999999
mean there are tons and tons of things

8943.84 --> 8948.319
that come out continually and I don't

8946.04 --> 8948.319000000001
watch

8948.33 --> 8951.389
[Music]

8954.399 --> 8959.278999999999
them why do the Russians always have to

8956.96 --> 8963.319
be the bad

8959.279 --> 8967.2
guys because Russia

8963.319 --> 8969.84
bad just but I mean look it was even

8967.2 --> 8973.720000000001
weirder because the Russians

8969.84 --> 8977.399
there they were not like presented as

8973.72 --> 8981.679999999998
like really super evil

8977.399 --> 8984.56
even be why because it was

8981.68 --> 8989.24
Soviets they were the

8984.56 --> 8992.68
Soviets so they weren't that evil yeah

8989.24 --> 8994.479
now if it was post Soviet era then all

8992.68 --> 8997.12
the Russians would all be oh my God

8994.479 --> 8999.438999999998
criminals oh we'll kill everyone they

8997.12 --> 9002.84
would have done that they didn't do it

8999.439 --> 9005.12
because it weren't freed from the Soviet

9002.84 --> 9009.439
Union so they would still have to

9005.12 --> 9013.6
portray it where you could have some

9009.439 --> 9018.24
sympathy with him yeah it's

9013.6 --> 9020.880000000001
Hollywood they know what they're doing

9018.24 --> 9026.479
they telling you exactly how to think

9020.88 --> 9028.24
about it yeah Soviet Russia good post of

9026.479 --> 9030.88
Russia

9028.24 --> 9032.92
bad yeah that's how they secretly want

9030.88 --> 9034.72
you to think about it yeah you might

9032.92 --> 9037.359
have preconceived ideas like oh but we

9034.72 --> 9038.92
like capitalism communism bad and

9037.359 --> 9041.800000000001
they'll be like yeah yeah capitalism

9038.92 --> 9044.479
good communism bad but but the office

9041.8 --> 9047.96

9044.479 --> 9049.479
human side except after the sopia junor

9047.96 --> 9052.199999999999
now they're all criminals oh we're going

9049.479 --> 9055.72
to kill everyone yeah that's what they

9052.2 --> 9055.720000000001
do that's what they

9057.54 --> 9063.04
[Music]

9059.64 --> 9064.57
do VNA is a cool

9063.04 --> 9071.399000000001
villain

9064.57 --> 9074.96
[Music]

9071.399 --> 9078.0
okay was that from the last

9074.96 --> 9079.339999999998
season yeah

9078.0 --> 9089.68
it was

9079.34 --> 9092.24
[Music]

9089.68 --> 9095.12
okay it's a bit annoying though because

9092.24 --> 9097.319
VNA is like a is a very serious

9095.12 --> 9099.52
developed thing in Dungeons and Dragons

9097.319 --> 9104.039999999999
and it wasn't exactly

9099.52 --> 9108.52
VNA but they did try though they did try

9104.04 --> 9110.52
it so it's like yeah okay okay admirable

9108.52 --> 9112.52
attempt it was

9110.52 --> 9115.800000000001
entertaining it's just that after all

9112.52 --> 9117.720000000001
this time I'm like yeah it's cool but

9115.8 --> 9122.56
I'm not like oh yeah did you watch that

9117.72 --> 9122.56
oh you got to see that not so

9123.74 --> 9126.798999999999
[Music]

9127.319 --> 9132.519999999999
much what Hollywood movies portrayed

9130.08 --> 9135.479
Soviet Russia as

9132.52 --> 9138.16
good no but they would always present

9135.479 --> 9140.72
him as the

9138.16 --> 9144.399
opponent the

9140.72 --> 9146.3
opponent and in ret it does feel like

9144.399 --> 9149.369999999999
it's not

9146.3 --> 9149.369999999999
[Music]

9150.12 --> 9156.92
like it would just be emphasized on how

9152.8 --> 9156.92
they're not free sort

9157.52 --> 9165.24
of it's it's it's difficult to

9162.66 --> 9167.2
[Music]

9165.24 --> 9170.56
explain

9167.2 --> 9173.560000000001
just look at the time based

9170.56 --> 9178.72
portrayals when it's still the Soviet

9173.56 --> 9180.88
Union and then after that just look at

9178.72 --> 9182.479
how they're

9180.88 --> 9187.64
portrayed

9182.479 --> 9189.72
yeah post Soviet Union is all super

9187.64 --> 9192.199999999999
corrupted super

9189.72 --> 9195.319
tyrannical all obsessed with

9192.2 --> 9196.68
assassinating people yeah that's

9195.319 --> 9199.56
everything

9196.68 --> 9201.479000000001
about Russia post Soviet Union in movie

9199.56 --> 9203.96
world when it's still the Soviet Union

9201.479 --> 9206.319
it's like oh the Soviet Union they are

9203.96 --> 9212.0
the opponents

9206.319 --> 9214.24
but they would still leave some sympathy

9212.0 --> 9216.64
room yeah they wouldn't just say yeah

9214.24 --> 9218.68
they're just overt disgusting criminals

9216.64 --> 9220.599999999999
that just want to kill everybody like

9218.68 --> 9224.720000000001
they do

9220.6 --> 9227.12
now just pretending like Russia is a is

9224.72 --> 9229.84
a third world dictator ship kind of

9227.12 --> 9232.640000000001
thing that's how they portray it now

9229.84 --> 9235.52
that's the difference they didn't do it

9232.64 --> 9238.479
like that they didn't overly

9235.52 --> 9241.24
villainize Russia when it was Soviet it

9238.479 --> 9244.47
was just the

9241.24 --> 9247.359
opponent don't you see

9244.47 --> 9250.16
[Music]

9247.359 --> 9254.479000000001
it yeah like even

9250.16 --> 9256.68
Rocky freaking Rocky man I will break

9254.479 --> 9258.24
you yeah

9256.68 --> 9260.960000000001
and you think like oh [ __ ] that's a

9258.24 --> 9263.479
really heavy opponent but Rocky like he

9260.96 --> 9266.32
gets it and he wins and then the Russian

9263.479 --> 9267.64
guy is even sympathetic with him

9266.32 --> 9271.96
[Music]

9267.64 --> 9276.319
yeah that's what I mean they leave room

9271.96 --> 9279.438999999998
for sympathy with the Soviet era Russia

9276.319 --> 9285.08
they do it they do it every time they do

9279.439 --> 9288.0
it every time every time yeah now modern

9285.08 --> 9291.56
Russia they're always just [ __ ]

9288.0 --> 9291.56
villains they're not

9300.479 --> 9303.8
redeemable guy killed Carl wellers in

9302.92 --> 9305.88
the

9303.8 --> 9308.358999999999
movie

9305.88 --> 9310.64
what I don't remember that I don't know

9308.359 --> 9312.279
about Rocky 4 I'm just remembering about

9310.64 --> 9316.72
that one because that one really stood

9312.279 --> 9319.880000000001
out it was an entire item it my point is

9316.72 --> 9321.96
is that what I just said I mean look at

9319.88 --> 9325.56
it think about

9321.96 --> 9329.119999999999
it they left some

9325.56 --> 9331.24
room to interpret Soviet Russia as

9329.12 --> 9334.220000000001
redeemable they are

9331.24 --> 9335.52
okay now they

9334.22 --> 9339.08
[Music]

9335.52 --> 9341.560000000001
don't now it's just a dictatorship and

9339.08 --> 9341.56
it's not

9341.64 --> 9348.24
redeemable it's only redeemable when

9344.84 --> 9351.359
every Russian is gay pretty much that's

9348.24 --> 9354.96
like how they do it now like only until

9351.359 --> 9358.08
the [ __ ] lgbtq Fleck and reign

9354.96 --> 9360.8
supreme everywhere in Russia only then

9358.08 --> 9364.279
is Russia free that's what they do

9360.8 --> 9367.88
now yeah that's

9364.279 --> 9367.880000000001
crap it's so

9368.479 --> 9372.88
obvious it's the same every

9374.92 --> 9377.92
time

9385.439 --> 9389.56
and hey if there's like an overt

9387.479 --> 9393.64
exception to this I'd like to hear about

9389.56 --> 9393.64
it because I haven't really come across

9395.68 --> 9401.6
any right and again this Falls like

9399.16 --> 9404.359
under overt programming not

9401.6 --> 9406.439
subliminal it's just this is how you're

9404.359 --> 9412.319
supposed to think about it

9406.439 --> 9416.319
Soviet Russia opponent but

9412.319 --> 9418.0
redeemable post Soviet Russia evil

9416.319 --> 9422.56
oligarchy

9418.0 --> 9422.56
dictatorship very evil not

9422.72 --> 9428.72
redeemable that's their programming so

9425.479 --> 9431.479

9428.72 --> 9437.8
think and feel about

9431.479 --> 9437.8

dude I yesterday night I was not having

10031.24 --> 10036.0
a good

10032.96 --> 10039.438999999998
time I was like

10036.0 --> 10042.2
it just happens sometimes like I go bad

10039.439 --> 10044.24
but what happens is the association it's

10042.2 --> 10046.359
so weird when I feel really terrible

10044.24 --> 10048.199999999999
it's like the Dark World stuff comes

10046.359 --> 10052.6
back to me and it's like I start

10048.2 --> 10052.6
remembering really bad parts of

10053.2 --> 10060.279
it where I was just in that experience

10057.24 --> 10064.52
indoctrinated like doom doom like

10060.279 --> 10068.08
absolute nightmarish ending Doom is

10064.52 --> 10070.24
coming for you like that was in there

10068.08 --> 10073.039999999999
and sometimes when I feel really bad it

10070.24 --> 10075.52
like pulls me back in it and it's very

10073.04 --> 10078.439
terrible to experience

10075.52 --> 10079.359
that but I do manage to pull myself out

10078.439 --> 10081.76
of it

10079.359 --> 10085.640000000001
again but every time I feel like that

10081.76 --> 10090.04
I'm always wondering like am I at when I

10085.64 --> 10095.199999999999
actually die am I am I going to

10090.04 --> 10097.0
hell because that was kind of suggested

10095.2 --> 10098.84
within it but on the other hand my

10097.0 --> 10100.56
healer says they're all demons they're

10098.84 --> 10103.56
all

10100.56 --> 10106.119999999999
liars and it is really basically about

10103.56 --> 10111.64
not surrendering to the idea and giving

10106.12 --> 10111.640000000001
everything to them to make it

10111.92 --> 10117.960000000001
happen and then you'll be free of it but

10115.8 --> 10121.0
every time I feel terrible I just get

10117.96 --> 10124.199999999999
pulled back in and it makes it real

10121.0 --> 10126.92
again it's just a horrifying experience

10124.2 --> 10129.359
really it is a literal nightmare that

10126.92 --> 10132.479
happens then waking it's not during

10129.359 --> 10134.359
sleep it's awake that's what's so

10132.479 --> 10137.24
because then it

10134.359 --> 10139.439
just it's just like the worst possible

10137.24 --> 10142.319
Outlook a person could ever

10139.439 --> 10145.16
feel is what I feel in a moment like

10142.319 --> 10147.16
that it's like I've done it what it

10145.16 --> 10149.039999999999
makes you think is you've done

10147.16 --> 10150.92
everything in your life wrong and

10149.04 --> 10152.800000000001
there's literally nothing you can do

10150.92 --> 10156.72
about it

10152.8 --> 10160.119999999999
anymore this one of the worst

10156.72 --> 10163.64
imaginable Sensations a person could

10160.12 --> 10165.479000000001
have in my position at least when you

10163.64 --> 10167.319
care about things I mean if you don't

10165.479 --> 10168.76
care about anything it will just be like

10167.319 --> 10170.56
yeah that's just hell in the background

10168.76 --> 10173.84
and I'm just an demon I'm just I don't

10170.56 --> 10177.039999999999
care well I do care and so it's really

10173.84 --> 10178.76
tormenting when that happens I didn't

10177.04 --> 10180.800000000001
really want to make it into entire

10178.76 --> 10181.92
subject but it does happen to me every

10180.8 --> 10186.72
now and

10181.92 --> 10186.72
then and it's freaky

10186.76 --> 10191.880000000001
it's like when I reference the Dark

10189.16 --> 10194.92
World people do keep forgetting there's

10191.88 --> 10198.839999999998
like a lot of really terrible things in

10194.92 --> 10201.72
there that I've experienced during that

10198.84 --> 10203.319
trip because often when I reference it I

10201.72 --> 10204.88
just reference like the interesting

10203.319 --> 10207.8
things like oh I saw something of the

10204.88 --> 10210.08
future what it don't reference is like

10207.8 --> 10213.88
oh yeah and while I was going through

10210.08 --> 10215.56
that it felt like the worst imaginable

10213.88 --> 10217.319
end

10215.56 --> 10218.92
that was going to happen and that was

10217.319 --> 10221.479
coming and there was nothing I could do

10218.92 --> 10224.84
about it and it's like pure torture

10221.479 --> 10229.199999999999
knowing it's a a form of torturous

10224.84 --> 10229.2
knowing that you can't compare to

10230.64 --> 10236.239
anything yeah that was also part of it

10233.8 --> 10239.119999999999
and that's why I will always keep

10236.239 --> 10243.6
saying whatever the [ __ ] it was that I

10239.12 --> 10243.6
went through don't do

10243.64 --> 10248.399
that

10245.479 --> 10249.72
just don't because if you're not strong

10248.399 --> 10252.399
enough of

10249.72 --> 10254.64
character you're going to end up to a

10252.399 --> 10258.519999999999
point where you are going to kill

10254.64 --> 10261.64
yourself just from the torment yeah I am

10258.52 --> 10263.52
avoiding that and I will never do it

10261.64 --> 10268.16
because I have a

10263.52 --> 10270.399000000001
system that literally makes it disables

10268.16 --> 10273.8
me from doing that like a robotic

10270.399 --> 10275.239
mechanism that I cultivated very early

10273.8 --> 10278.92
on

10275.239 --> 10281.5
the deal with torment that I did

10278.92 --> 10285.64
experience very early on in my

10281.5 --> 10289.84
[Music]

10285.64 --> 10292.519999999999
life it's like don't let the terror

10289.84 --> 10292.52
snuff you

10294.12 --> 10300.479000000001
out like oh everything freezes up if

10297.359 --> 10302.239
only terrible things are on your mind

10300.479 --> 10305.56
and terrible things you would want to do

10302.239 --> 10308.8
are on your mind then freeze up like you

10305.56 --> 10308.8
just don't do anything

10309.88 --> 10315.8
then like oh you want to end it you

10313.12 --> 10319.880000000001
can't bear another second well then just

10315.8 --> 10322.0
sit there and be in trance until it goes

10319.88 --> 10323.56
away or until you figure out it's not

10322.0 --> 10327.52
going to go away by just sitting there

10323.56 --> 10330.88
waiting until it goes away yeah just

10327.52 --> 10333.0
absolutely nothing you can

10330.88 --> 10337.119999999999
do that

10333.0 --> 10339.479
would agree or work together with any of

10337.12 --> 10341.239000000001
those tyes of thinking or

10339.479 --> 10344.56
feelings that's

10341.239 --> 10348.51
like fanatical mechanism that's in me

10344.56 --> 10350.039999999999
that I built there with my will very

10348.51 --> 10353.16
[Music]

10350.04 --> 10355.52
young physical exercise helps me yeah

10353.16 --> 10358.76
well it would help me too if I wasn't

10355.52 --> 10358.76
just about to go to

10363.16 --> 10369.2
bed but it is true if you feel all that

10366.6 --> 10372.239
kind of dread then physical exercise

10369.2 --> 10374.16
does actually like pull it through you

10372.239 --> 10377.0
and then eventually you'll be released

10374.16 --> 10377.0
from it that is

10377.08 --> 10382.12
true the problem is that when it

10379.319 --> 10386.16
overwhelms me is specifically in moments

10382.12 --> 10388.560000000001
where I can't do physical exercise like

10386.16 --> 10391.239
it's not an option then and that's when

10388.56 --> 10393.96
it typically

10391.239 --> 10396.039999999999
happens it's just waiting for me to be

10393.96 --> 10397.438999999998
like as helpless as possible to just

10396.04 --> 10400.439
torture

10397.439 --> 10403.319
me and the weirdest thing is I remember

10400.439 --> 10407.439
it I remember it doing to me it's like

10403.319 --> 10410.278999999999
the thing that's doing that to me is me

10407.439 --> 10413.279
on the other side I remember it

10410.279 --> 10415.92
happening and I remember being like

10413.279 --> 10418.479000000001
tortured for realizing that I was

10415.92 --> 10422.479
looking at the thing that was doing it

10418.479 --> 10425.199999999999
to me liking and wanting to do it when

10422.479 --> 10428.358999999999
consciously I did not want any of that

10425.2 --> 10431.04
to happen at all but I was forced to

10428.359 --> 10431.04
experience

10432.12 --> 10437.720000000001
it to force to experience my own torture

10436.6 --> 10441.12
with

10437.72 --> 10445.199999999999
Glee and I couldn't prevent it from

10441.12 --> 10445.94
experiencing it it's you can't imagine

10445.2 --> 10452.11
what it's

10445.94 --> 10452.11
[Music]

10452.12 --> 10460.04
like you just can nobody

10456.239 --> 10462.76
can unless you literally experience it

10460.04 --> 10465.960000000001
yourself and then you know it's just too

10462.76 --> 10468.2
horrible to even to open it up to the

10465.96 --> 10471.278999999999
world and communicate about it really

10468.2 --> 10473.92
I'm now doing it for demonstrator

10471.279 --> 10476.720000000001
purposes just to like elucidate about it

10473.92 --> 10479.04
but I don't like talking about how

10476.72 --> 10482.08
unbelievably [ __ ] torturous the

10479.04 --> 10485.640000000001
experience was a big part of it most of

10482.08 --> 10488.6
it I don't like to brag about how

10485.64 --> 10491.56
torturous it was it was just horrendous

10488.6 --> 10494.960000000001
and I feel terrible and I feel stupid

10491.56 --> 10499.0
like why the [ __ ] did you do that what

10494.96 --> 10499.0
the hell is wrong with you

10501.92 --> 10511.439
Arwin like I just wish that I was there

10506.96 --> 10513.64
being older alongside me to like really

10511.439 --> 10515.68
like grab me in the hair and like what

10513.64 --> 10517.239
the [ __ ] [ __ ] do you think you're doing

10515.68 --> 10520.880000000001
you

10517.239 --> 10522.8
freak you stop doing that or I'll keep

10520.88 --> 10527.039999999999
hating

10522.8 --> 10533.219
you stop doing it you [ __ ]

10527.04 --> 10533.219000000001
[Music]

10534.92 --> 10541.76
freak but I can't I can only communicate

10539.319 --> 10543.84
back and forth because it's still

10541.76 --> 10544.76
happening it's still happening that

10543.84 --> 10550.72
torture

10544.76 --> 10550.72
experience is still happening right now

10551.68 --> 10556.12
parallel what advice would I give my

10554.279 --> 10557.68
younger

10556.12 --> 10561.2
self

10557.68 --> 10564.0
nothing advice would be turn in the

10561.2 --> 10566.800000000001
experience everything off don't

10564.0 --> 10569.88
experience anything ever

10566.8 --> 10572.64
again yeah the Dark World Experience

10569.88 --> 10574.759999999998
Must Die everything about it must die

10572.64 --> 10576.439
because everything you experience there

10574.76 --> 10580.92
is my

10576.439 --> 10580.92
torture is the hatred of

10582.479 --> 10588.56
me is the inability to understand me is

10586.52 --> 10591.2
everything that is terrible about this

10588.56 --> 10593.08
[ __ ] world is in that experience from

10591.2 --> 10596.08
A firsters

10593.08 --> 10601.0
View with

10596.08 --> 10603.6
feelings from that other thing it's all

10601.0 --> 10606.12
horrendous it's my arch enemy in every

10603.6 --> 10609.56
corner that I literally experienced

10606.12 --> 10609.560000000001
there and it's

10623.6 --> 10630.04
unbearable and I nothing like I did

10626.8 --> 10633.039999999999
everything wrong in there it's like the

10630.04 --> 10636.640000000001
entire way I entered that thing that

10633.04 --> 10641.640000000001
experience was just everything I did

10636.64 --> 10645.278999999999
wrong every way I drew conclusions was

10641.64 --> 10648.96
wrong everything I even secretly was

10645.279 --> 10652.560000000001
trying to intend to do I did

10648.96 --> 10656.8
wrong I [ __ ] it all up the entire

10652.56 --> 10659.08
experience is a gigantic [ __ ] up like in

10656.8 --> 10662.358999999999
every [ __ ] way you could imagine I

10659.08 --> 10665.2
[ __ ] it up the only way I didn't [ __ ]

10662.359 --> 10668.239
it up is that I still remember remember

10665.2 --> 10670.92
it that's the only thing about

10668.239 --> 10673.199999999999
it everything that happened in there was

10670.92 --> 10675.399
all

10673.2 --> 10678.0
horrendous everything was wrong

10675.399 --> 10679.479
everything was like exactly the opposite

10678.0 --> 10682.279
of what I

10679.479 --> 10684.72
want

10682.279 --> 10686.810000000001
fundamentally I only got to see the

10684.72 --> 10690.65
terrible

10686.81 --> 10690.65
[Music]

10692.439 --> 10699.439
things all I want wanted in an entire

10695.08 --> 10700.96
experience was just get me out get me

10699.439 --> 10704.64
out of

10700.96 --> 10710.839999999998
here make it stop I want to go back to

10704.64 --> 10710.84
the normal World get me out get me out

10710.96 --> 10719.479
now like I don't care about anything any

10714.439 --> 10721.479000000001
me anymore get me out of that [ __ ]

10719.479 --> 10726.479
experience get

10721.479 --> 10726.479
out I want to go back get me

10729.68 --> 10736.04
out there's nothing you can get in the

10733.56 --> 10740.278999999999
past from the future that's useful to

10736.04 --> 10743.800000000001
you nothing and there never will be

10740.279 --> 10746.279
anything only the devil and your

10743.8 --> 10750.0
destruction is what could get a [ __ ]

10746.279 --> 10754.08
Advantage out of the [ __ ] future you

10750.0 --> 10756.359
hear the only way that this can be fixed

10754.08 --> 10759.8
is if you'd never done

10756.359 --> 10764.2
it and never

10759.8 --> 10766.8
will that's the only way it can be fixed

10764.2 --> 10768.880000000001
and guess what it happened you can't do

10766.8 --> 10771.8
that you [ __ ] it up and there's

10768.88 --> 10773.449999999999
nothing you can ever [ __ ] do about it

10771.8 --> 10782.84
ever

10773.45 --> 10784.34
[Music]

10782.84 --> 10801.399
again

10784.34 --> 10801.399
[Music]

10809.88 --> 10812.399
I have some

10812.76 --> 10815.76
frustrations

10819.399 --> 10824.16
it's like the entire [ __ ] dwol

10821.56 --> 10826.76
experience is like I it's like a stupid

10824.16 --> 10830.399
consolidation curiosity that I just

10826.76 --> 10834.960000000001
share because fundamentally the entire
