Arwen and before I start to show please

59.659 --> 63.199
don't forget to share it on any platform

you deem fit and if you haven't already

63.199 --> 66.47
subscribed to my channel and hit the

64.879 --> 68.42
bell notification so you know when I'm

66.47 --> 71.09
going live just normally 2:00 p.m.

68.42 --> 73.85
Amsterdam time every day and please also

71.09 --> 76.07000000000001
do support me through the paypal patreon

73.85 --> 78.28899999999999
my GoFundMe the super chat and the

76.07 --> 83.24
membership system join button that would

78.289 --> 87.31
be much appreciated so yeah today the

83.24 --> 93.11
weather is pretty heavy summer weather

87.31 --> 96.679
but yeah I was out till last minute

93.11 --> 99.409
pretty much so that's why I'm a bit late

96.679 --> 102.02
again sorry about that but yeah the wind

99.409 --> 103.85000000000001
is surprisingly fresh though like I was

102.02 --> 106.55
there in my t-shirt and yeah when I'm

103.85 --> 110.08999999999999
just standing still in the Sun it's

106.55 --> 111.86
really hot but yeah then you the wind

110.09 --> 118.629
catches you and it's actually kind of

111.86 --> 118.629
fresh it's weird but yeah a great day

120.049 --> 128.619
to just go out for a walk smell the

125.119 --> 131.3
fresh air while catching that son

128.619 --> 136.01
yeah there's a bit of haze up there

131.3 --> 139.61
again it does seem very same the same

136.01 --> 145.25
like yesterday so I think there are some

139.61 --> 147.92000000000002
trails still visible but yeah

145.25 --> 151.25
yes there just yeah notice that as the

147.92 --> 154.30999999999997
evening progressed there was no trace

151.25 --> 158.569
left ready haze up there it became just

154.31 --> 167.45
very clear and that seems to happen more

158.569 --> 170.63
often so yeah anyway I got just green

167.45 --> 173.45
tea with me and I'm not gonna eat it but

170.63 --> 176.239
I got a grapefruit and this was actually

173.45 --> 178.32899999999998
the smallest one they had I could have

176.239 --> 182.54
gotten like this big but yeah that's

178.329 --> 184.76000000000002
it's a little bit too much I finally ate

182.54 --> 187.09
that freaking Apple yesterday and it was

184.76 --> 187.09
delicious

187.63 --> 198.23
mmm man I've been up for so long

193.12 --> 200.06
yesterday like I was pretty shocked in

198.23 --> 202.459
the morning to notice that I could see

200.06 --> 209.17000000000002
the morning light it was that late so I

202.459 --> 209.17000000000002
think it was up till 4:00 or 5:00 and

209.889 --> 214.09900000000002
because yeah there was just so much

212.269 --> 221.0
activity

214.099 --> 226.069
I did another upload what's that yes

221.0 --> 230.63
yeah it was yesterday I think I did that

226.069 --> 233.58999999999997
around 8 o'clock I uploaded it and was

230.63 --> 236.45
from like an hour before that 7 7 p.m.

233.59 --> 239.989
in the flat earth debate after show

236.45 --> 243.85899999999998
panel and with the usual crowd cheeky

239.989 --> 246.019
and a couple of others and yeah so

243.859 --> 249.29000000000002
that's another members-only video I

246.019 --> 251.959
think at least good servant has part of

249.29 --> 255.82899999999998
it they'll know about the others

251.959 --> 258.829
but yeah I got pretty rough with Chucky

255.829 --> 264.38
especially and he was just a total

258.829 --> 268.93
rumpus and after that after the premiere

264.38 --> 272.65999999999997
of QE happened he also dove in there

268.93 --> 277.25
apparently and that just went on for

272.66 --> 281.27000000000004
hours yeah what what Falcon nine

277.25 --> 283.66
what is it requiem dream what what about

281.27 --> 283.65999999999997
it

288.19 --> 294.55
I get it you said it Falcon 9 Falcon 9

291.97 --> 303.37
Falcon 9 yeah you did your information

294.55 --> 305.14
place and we get it okay I don't even

303.37 --> 308.02
know what that is I I don't think I

305.14 --> 310.03
really cared that much I don't think

308.02 --> 312.09999999999997
anything about it I don't know what it

310.03 --> 314.04999999999995
is and I don't think I care because I'm

312.1 --> 316.81
already got the feeling it has something

314.05 --> 323.98
to do with some [ __ ] supposed

316.81 --> 326.71
outerspace project or whatever so know

323.98 --> 343.6
that you don't musk Rachel oh sure why

326.71 --> 348.84999999999997
not anyway yeah that just kept on going

343.6 --> 351.85
up until deep into the night oh yeah

348.85 --> 353.86
I've been listening a lot view of music

351.85 --> 357.48
or pretty much one singular song that

353.86 --> 357.48
it's just a very good song

366.889 --> 373.879
gun boots okay

370.31 --> 375.71
what look this is guys I don't know what

373.879 --> 379.78000000000003
supposedly happened but it's the very

375.71 --> 379.78
first time ever that I'm hearing of it

385.93 --> 391.40000000000003
but I take it that if I'm gonna look

389.3 --> 398.53000000000003
around it's gonna be all over the news I

391.4 --> 398.53
didn't do any searching just yet today

419.169 --> 422.169
okay

429.37 --> 436.21
is it even knew what supposedly happened

433.66 --> 439.33000000000004
did like yesterday a Falcon 9 launch

436.21 --> 441.52
happened because I don't see anything

439.33 --> 445.2
I'm looking it up and it's just a

441.52 --> 445.2
description of the vehicle that's it

451.37 --> 454.41
[Music]

465.52 --> 468.18
nope

473.41 --> 482.49
see a couple of references to SpaceX

479.32 --> 482.49
that's it

498.27 --> 501.63
[Music]

505.4 --> 511.15
[Music]

508.17 --> 513.69
yeah well I don't need that in caps AGM

511.15 --> 513.6899999999999
Thanks

544.74 --> 547.83
[Music]

556.49 --> 564.08
now I'm not sleepy atm yeah I've just

561.44 --> 565.9100000000001
I'm not feeling all that great like I

564.08 --> 568.49
didn't have enough sleep doesn't mean

565.91 --> 571.42
I'm sleepy it just feels light means I

568.49 --> 571.42
don't feel that great

592.66 --> 596.7199999999999
right

593.64 --> 596.72
[Music]

665.27 --> 672.98
yeah yeah sorry guys I'm just it's gonna

669.44 --> 674.839
be a slow start I hope I'll move on a

672.98 --> 679.0600000000001
little bit more I'm just not feeling all

674.839 --> 681.86
that great uh too late

679.06 --> 684.4699999999999
think like the wine might have caught

681.86 --> 688.76
got to me yesterday night a little knot

684.47 --> 693.6700000000001
in my hat it's mostly my guts feeling

688.76 --> 693.67
kind of yeah

706.18 --> 712.6099999999999
still have no freakin idea what you guys

709.339 --> 716.089
are talking about is blah blah blah blah

712.61 --> 719.149
Falkenhayn space launch thingy blood

716.089 --> 721.0400000000001
that I don't even know what this is

719.149 --> 722.29
about at this point why did you even

721.04 --> 728.12
bring that up

722.29 --> 732.5889999999999
did something just happen like something

728.12 --> 733.43
happened rights not too long ago what is

732.589 --> 735.9490000000001
it

733.43 --> 738.7589999999999
what happened if you're bringing this up

735.949 --> 740.709
it's starting to piss me off

738.759 --> 743.8100000000001
because at this point it's just

740.709 --> 747.1389999999999
stickering with freaking NASA nonsense

743.81 --> 750.649
if you're just gonna say oh a vehicle

747.139 --> 752.6
yeah a vehicle a vehicle a vehicle what

750.649 --> 756.97
does that mean did something happen

752.6 --> 756.97
didn't it happen why are you bringing up

762.96 --> 772.589
right yesterday a launch in Florida

765.92 --> 775.1999999999999
finally Jesus Christ it's like provide

772.589 --> 777.96
information please if you're gonna bring

775.2 --> 783.45
something up you know I already told you

777.96 --> 785.1600000000001
I don't know anything about this no you

783.45 --> 787.5200000000001
can't post a link because you don't have

785.16 --> 787.52
a wrench

814.71 --> 821.73
edgy nah maybe I'm just a little pissed

818.5 --> 826.24
off maybe it's because I've been

821.73 --> 829.6
tolerating baller [ __ ] maybe a

826.24 --> 831.1
little bit too much like I think that's

829.6 --> 833.95
probably part of why I'm nauseated

831.1 --> 837.37
because I basically hung around with

833.95 --> 839.4100000000001
frickin Chucky and others that are just

837.37 --> 843.64
as bad as him or maybe worse in some

839.41 --> 845.98
ways for a total of like five hours over

843.64 --> 850.26
the day and I think I'm just a little

845.98 --> 853.54
sick of it literally and I have now yeah

850.26 --> 856.96
contracted at least a temporary allergic

853.54 --> 860.89
response to anything baller ish and

856.96 --> 864.87
pointless it's like why are you

860.89 --> 864.87
indifferent inserting some nonsense

865.74 --> 875.76
apparently there is some another yeah

869.41 --> 875.76
rocket launch whatever it's just great

878.9 --> 885.24
mm-hmm yeah thanks good surfing for the

882.03 --> 888.98
dollar 8 super chat donation I'll be all

885.24 --> 888.98
right up just the little crumby I think

894.62 --> 898.85
another toilet break or something

902.36 --> 910.14
it's not fair is it it's not fair that

908.25 --> 912.99
I'm gonna call it fake

910.14 --> 915.26
when pretty damn sure it's fake I don't

912.99 --> 915.26
know

1067.45 --> 1079.419
okay all right I think I'll be all right

1083.0 --> 1086.119
[Music]

1094.37 --> 1098.7199999999998
200 miles a minute

1105.53 --> 1110.11
yeah that that would be incredibly fast

1126.269 --> 1139.999
yeah what's seeking Starwood is what is

1135.959 --> 1139.999
it okay if I just treat it as a light

1152.98 --> 1159.53
okay well good servant look those types

1155.96 --> 1164.1200000000001
of speed those can never really happen

1159.53 --> 1168.1399999999999
on earth anyway so those speeds are

1164.12 --> 1174.35
based on calculations of what they think

1168.14 --> 1177.14
will happen yeah when a when something

1174.35 --> 1178.9399999999998
is being propelled in a vacuum which is

1177.14 --> 1181.5800000000002
very odd in the first place and then

1178.94 --> 1183.95
like the momentum will keep on carrying

1181.58 --> 1187.1799999999998
it and so because of the lack of

1183.95 --> 1190.28
friction from the lack of air pressure

1187.18 --> 1194.15
yeah an object could move at pretty

1190.28 --> 1199.25
insane speeds because yeah there is

1194.15 --> 1201.6200000000001
supposedly less friction and then like

1199.25 --> 1204.71
there wouldn't be as much vibration

1201.62 --> 1206.6299999999999
resonance going on because on earth that

1204.71 --> 1209.39
does happen when you go incredibly fast

1206.63 --> 1211.94
to get into resonation situations and it

1209.39 --> 1215.7800000000002
could literally vibrate the machine

1211.94 --> 1221.27
apart if it's not carefully designed to

1215.78 --> 1224.62
account for that so that's that those

1221.27 --> 1228.74
types of speeds are conceptual based on

1224.62 --> 1231.4399999999998
the idea of how fast a vehicle could go

1228.74 --> 1234.3700000000001
in the supposed outer space that's

1231.44 --> 1234.3700000000001
always what that is

1241.47 --> 1244.539
[Music]

1255.779 --> 1260.84
Wow ten seconds shot and that's it

1270.5 --> 1277.9
ya know Toby resonation its oscillation

1274.01 --> 1281.21
you know sound sound based resonation

1277.9 --> 1285.799
something starts oscillating and all

1281.21 --> 1288.28
that falls under resonance yeah that's a

1285.799 --> 1288.28
real thing

1337.98 --> 1346.559
what would propel something in space

1340.59 --> 1349.73
well momentum mostly although yeah

1346.559 --> 1352.2
there's kind of like shoved in between

1349.73 --> 1356.27
don't think about it too much it still

1352.2 --> 1359.22
suggested that things like thrusters

1356.27 --> 1363.15
supposedly work in space although yeah

1359.22 --> 1364.77
any any type of empirical testing if

1363.15 --> 1368.7
that it would actually work

1364.77 --> 1371.1
yeah results in that it'll just cause an

1368.7 --> 1375.45
object to just rotate wildly around

1371.1 --> 1378.03
itself and not actually displace if

1375.45 --> 1379.95
there is extreme low pressure or a

1378.03 --> 1383.1299999999999
vacuum right next to it it's death

1379.95 --> 1385.74
doesn't have that effect in reality but

1383.13 --> 1390.71
it still suggested that that is the

1385.74 --> 1393.57
standard maneuvering ability in space

1390.71 --> 1396.51
but other than that everything is mostly

1393.57 --> 1400.34
going on momentum just gaining that

1396.51 --> 1403.98
supposed speed not being dragged down by

1400.34 --> 1410.0
gravity relative density disequilibrium

1403.98 --> 1410.0
and then just yeah keep on floating

1413.09 --> 1418.76
retaining the speed that's supposedly

1415.919 --> 1418.76
how they're worse

1433.32 --> 1436.349
[Music]

1444.65 --> 1451.3090000000002
think that's funny Toby it's freaking

1450.86 --> 1455.27
hot

1451.309 --> 1459.1589999999999
why would I do why would I wear a

1455.27 --> 1459.1589999999999
sweater right now that's insane

1476.6 --> 1483.37
oh really oh okay well you're banned

1504.74 --> 1509.6
now don't worry about it good chef and

1506.87 --> 1515.12
I'll take care of it I know you're very

1509.6 --> 1518.87
eager like dude as soon as you and Tom

1515.12 --> 1521.87
Parker will do actual life streams and

1518.87 --> 1523.1599999999999
not just record it you would have like a

1521.87 --> 1526.1889999999999
field day with Chapman

1523.16 --> 1526.189
[Music]

1558.41 --> 1565.97
well look I'm not too worried about

1560.66 --> 1568.45
trolls really it's just that yeah I

1565.97 --> 1574.28
don't have like a what is it liquor

1568.45 --> 1577.22
presentation to give or something so I'm

1574.28 --> 1579.17
gonna be relying more on the chat and if

1577.22 --> 1582.2
people are just putting in lame [ __ ]

1579.17 --> 1583.0900000000001
there and not really trying to be

1582.2 --> 1588.68
helpful

1583.09 --> 1593.0
then yeah I'll be more inclined to get a

1588.68 --> 1595.64
little rough start banning and yeah Toby

1593.0 --> 1597.86
was just insulting me for absolutely no

1595.64 --> 1601.49
reason bringing up something that was

1597.86 --> 1605.03
lame like it some people think it's

1601.49 --> 1608.57
really funny a turtleneck and those

1605.03 --> 1614.47
people are lame that's just dumb if you

1608.57 --> 1614.47
think that's funny now

1639.63 --> 1642.3500000000001
hmm

1644.03 --> 1650.06
but did I go through chat I think I

1646.16 --> 1654.5600000000002
completely forgot like I completely skip

1650.06 --> 1674.75
that today that's yeah it just goes to

1654.56 --> 1676.61
show I'm a little off my routine but

1674.75 --> 1679.43
there is really something about this

1676.61 --> 1680.9299999999998
weather and you know and but the some in

1679.43 --> 1684.38
the energy coming from there

1680.93 --> 1689.3300000000002
I'm I I don't know man I'm just going

1684.38 --> 1692.0600000000002
out on my bike going to wherever and I

1689.33 --> 1694.8799999999999
just I don't know what it is but I'm

1692.06 --> 1700.19
seeing a lot of women that I find

1694.88 --> 1702.8600000000001
absurdly attractive it's like whoa why

1700.19 --> 1705.5
don't I spot these normally like don't

1702.86 --> 1708.49
they come out they only come out when it

1705.5 --> 1712.85
is actually Gauri's weather or something

1708.49 --> 1721.61
or maybe I'm yeah I'm just in the mood

1712.85 --> 1731.6599999999999
but yeah I get baffled sometimes I

1721.61 --> 1734.33
realizing like wow like I can't testify

1731.66 --> 1737.9
to what it's like for women with men but

1734.33 --> 1741.8
me with women it's like there are so

1737.9 --> 1744.1100000000001
many sorts with so many stories and that

1741.8 --> 1750.11
all have hearts and all that and I

1744.11 --> 1752.6
reflect upon it but then at times you

1750.11 --> 1754.58
just get confronted with those that need

1752.6 --> 1757.06
the attention the most and they're

1754.58 --> 1759.83
probably not the most looking

1757.06 --> 1762.6799999999998
good-looking ones and then you kind of

1759.83 --> 1764.57
think that's it's all that and then in

1762.68 --> 1766.8200000000002
other times it just changes around and

1764.57 --> 1769.61
solely you just get slapped in the face

1766.82 --> 1774.08
by just amazing sights of really

1769.61 --> 1776.62
beautiful women that are just there it's

1774.08 --> 1776.62
so weird

1780.36 --> 1785.1299999999999
and anyway this it's very much about my

1782.909 --> 1787.8300000000002
experience I'm not trying to say that

1785.13 --> 1790.409
all women are this are all women or that

1787.83 --> 1793.1689999999999
absolutely not it but it's just there's

1790.409 --> 1796.3500000000001
something about this summer summer does

1793.169 --> 1800.3990000000001
that to men well it is almost like a

1796.35 --> 1804.1789999999999
spell I I don't understand what's going

1800.399 --> 1807.9599999999998
on like that cuz it's just to say me I

1804.179 --> 1810.0
look literally exactly the same like

1807.96 --> 1812.76
okay I'm having a I have a white shirt

1810.0 --> 1815.97
on how but when I go out I don't do that

1812.76 --> 1818.58
because it'll get too dirty too quick so

1815.97 --> 1822.1200000000001
I'm just literally looking exactly the

1818.58 --> 1827.789
same as I always have always it's yeah

1822.12 --> 1835.6789999999999
pretty monotone might look and yeah you

1827.789 --> 1839.37
know it's different other people other

1835.679 --> 1843.269
looks I notice just the beauty of

1839.37 --> 1846.6299999999999
certain girls faces a lot more and I

1843.269 --> 1849.72
just also noticed that some of them are

1846.63 --> 1851.97
actually smart too and I don't know I

1849.72 --> 1855.299
just look into it too much it's my

1851.97 --> 1857.3700000000001
instinct is just this is like going any

1855.299 --> 1859.71
other dimension digging in like what's

1857.37 --> 1862.2299999999998
there and yeah this like really

1859.71 --> 1864.029
good-looking and freakin smart women

1862.23 --> 1868.1100000000001
that are like contemplating things on a

1864.029 --> 1870.21
very serious level and I can see it on

1868.11 --> 1872.9399999999998
their look that they have properly

1870.21 --> 1876.33
nourished instincts to guide them it's

1872.94 --> 1878.97
like ah now that kind of thing kind of

1876.33 --> 1884.1299999999999
gets me off that's something that makes

1878.97 --> 1885.059
my heart my heart pump a little extra in

1884.13 --> 1891.75
a few seconds

1885.059 --> 1893.49
yeah but it's it's rare because it's

1891.75 --> 1895.08
usually the moments when they don't

1893.49 --> 1898.909
think they're being watched or like

1895.08 --> 1901.74
they're just focusing into themselves

1898.909 --> 1904.0800000000002
because as soon as they wouldn't notice

1901.74 --> 1907.919
that I'm looking then yeah might change

1904.08 --> 1910.11
and I don't always even get looks of

1907.919 --> 1911.909
this appreciation like I do get looks of

1910.11 --> 1912.61
appreciation there there's women out

1911.909 --> 1915.279
there that

1912.61 --> 1920.08
they do find me kind of attractive don't

1915.279 --> 1925.169
know why but yeah I'm I'm not a woman so

1920.08 --> 1929.4399999999998
I don't get it you know I find myself

1925.169 --> 1931.529
very pleasant when I'm confident but

1929.44 --> 1932.769
that's not the same thing as like who

1931.529 --> 1937.51
are we

1932.769 --> 1941.23
oh no that I don't get that but I'm very

1937.51 --> 1944.5
happy when that happens to a woman when

1941.23 --> 1948.669
I'm lucky enough to be able to I don't

1944.5 --> 1951.669
know get close to her but to me it's

1948.669 --> 1955.8090000000002
more about how the women then can enjoy

1951.669 --> 1959.19
that anyway

1955.809 --> 1959.19
I'm thinking a lot about that I think

1967.11 --> 1970.24
[Music]

1971.49 --> 1976.029
and yeah the weird thing and I'm not

1973.779 --> 1978.1
even really thinking about sex or

1976.029 --> 1981.669
anything like that the day little pro it

1978.1 --> 1986.35
would probably happen to me in my mind

1981.669 --> 1995.679
much much more alluring is just I don't

1986.35 --> 1999.9089999999999
know just like subtle hugging just yeah

1995.679 --> 2002.3090000000002
did that soft touch that it's how do you

1999.909 --> 2005.22
even describe that that's the stuff

2002.309 --> 2008.1
that's hanging in my mind not like oh

2005.22 --> 2012.26
I'm gonna I'm gonna bang that or

2008.1 --> 2012.26
something that no

2018.68 --> 2022.76
I don't know maybe it's just because I'm

2021.23 --> 2032.78
kind of a romantic

2022.76 --> 2035.06
I was alert to female to the females and

2032.78 --> 2037.3999999999999
there was very young before I literally

2035.06 --> 2040.04
even knew what freaking sex was okay I

2037.4 --> 2047.2900000000002
was in love and like getting all love

2040.04 --> 2050.12
drunk on girls when I was seven

2047.29 --> 2052.79
kind of like literally with girl

2050.12 --> 2054.56
classmates that barely knew what was a

2052.79 --> 2056.12
world going on when I was just like

2054.56 --> 2059.87
completely in love while they're just

2056.12 --> 2062.69
like oh yeah he's nice it's good yeah I

2059.87 --> 2065.77
did I had that way before I even knew

2062.69 --> 2065.77
what the hell sex was

2076.24 --> 2083.7099999999996
oh you'd like that wouldn't you raccoon

2079.72 --> 2086.919
dream oh the ballers can only find a

2083.71 --> 2089.7
good girl for our wind and maybe he

2086.919 --> 2093.2799999999997
wouldn't crush us so badly every day

2089.7 --> 2097.98
every freaking day going around and

2093.28 --> 2100.3900000000003
absolutely just pummeling ballers trolls

2097.98 --> 2104.55
crushing them with arguments that they

2100.39 --> 2107.8289999999997
can't refute that they can't escape from

2104.55 --> 2112.569
every single day yeah yeah yeah find me

2107.829 --> 2115.869
really awesome girl that's right it

2112.569 --> 2120.119
might work but the thing is if it's just

2115.869 --> 2125.2000000000003
gonna be some yeah beauty looks squirter

2120.119 --> 2128.17
did it's not gonna do anything look I

2125.2 --> 2131.0499999999997
don't need a woman that just wants sex

2128.17 --> 2135.7000000000003
or something I've had that does it work

2131.05 --> 2141.299
now I need a connection

2135.7 --> 2145.27
I need a connection in the heart I need

2141.299 --> 2149.559
someone that can actually see Who I am

2145.27 --> 2152.589
fully even what I'm kind of hiding from

2149.559 --> 2156.2200000000003
the world publicly I need them to be

2152.589 --> 2159.549
able to see that and like be with me

2156.22 --> 2165.91
there in secret it's really important to

2159.549 --> 2168.73
me it's like that true partnership like

2165.91 --> 2172.5
the conspiracy within a relation that's

2168.73 --> 2172.5
critical to me

2180.87 --> 2186.91
Cobras are traitors to humanity okay so

2185.47 --> 2200.3799999999997
the baby it sounds a little dramatic

2186.91 --> 2204.2799999999997
they're seeking star water no yeah

2200.38 --> 2208.4500000000003
requiem dream yeah I wouldn't do this

2204.28 --> 2212.9100000000003
show well you know what technically I

2208.45 --> 2217.66
could have started doing this show in

2212.91 --> 2223.69
2012 did you know that my girlfriend

2217.66 --> 2226.0
actually tried to push me to do it to

2223.69 --> 2232.36
get on YouTube and start talking about

2226.0 --> 2236.74
anything and everything but I was just

2232.36 --> 2237.96
too afraid it was too nervous about the

2236.74 --> 2241.0299999999997
whole thing

2237.96 --> 2243.7
so I didn't do it I kind of chickened

2241.03 --> 2245.86
out feel really annoyed by that it

2243.7 --> 2248.41
didn't look good on me but I was just

2245.86 --> 2250.57
not ready for that I wanted to but I

2248.41 --> 2255.0099999999998
just couldn't do it yet it took a lot of

2250.57 --> 2257.23
time for me to like handle like yeah you

2255.01 --> 2259.5
are going to be a public face guy and

2257.23 --> 2263.61
there's going to be like a giant

2259.5 --> 2266.71
tapestry following you around of a

2263.61 --> 2269.4700000000003
virtual group of people that are gonna

2266.71 --> 2273.01
be obsessed with making me feel like I'm

2269.47 --> 2277.72
hated by a lot of people that's the

2273.01 --> 2279.7000000000003
natural consequence for me if I would

2277.72 --> 2281.98
start doing what I do the way that I do

2279.7 --> 2285.8799999999997
it with like this crazy level of honesty

2281.98 --> 2288.7
and purity and I couldn't handle it back

2285.88 --> 2292.0
then now I've settled that I have no

2288.7 --> 2294.7
freakin other choice I have no other

2292.0 --> 2299.31
choice than to do all this it's like the

2294.7 --> 2306.24
only course left for me bar just

2299.31 --> 2306.24
extinguishing so yeah this is what I do

2309.08 --> 2316.56
and I don't even know if I can handle a

2314.46 --> 2317.28
relationship at this point not really

2316.56 --> 2320.88
you know

2317.28 --> 2324.57
let's first have some connection any

2320.88 --> 2327.54
connection just a contact a girl that'll

2324.57 --> 2328.4900000000002
actually say hey yeah I'm gonna talk to

2327.54 --> 2332.64
this guy

2328.49 --> 2334.35
instead of just looking at me right now

2332.64 --> 2336.27
I'm being complaining that girls don't

2334.35 --> 2337.83
step to me right that's that's kind of

2336.27 --> 2339.45
weird but I've just never been good at

2337.83 --> 2342.18
it it's like every time I step toward

2339.45 --> 2345.12
somebody it's either have to be in a

2342.18 --> 2347.25
huge ego high moment and almost

2345.12 --> 2351.96
accidentally do it and then it works or

2347.25 --> 2357.18
I just become too nervous and that never

2351.96 --> 2358.95
looks good or it's in a circle friend

2357.18 --> 2361.02
situation and that it's kind of a

2358.95 --> 2362.6699999999996
different dynamic but I don't really

2361.02 --> 2367.98
have a circle of friends like that

2362.67 --> 2370.17
anymore like not with physical people

2367.98 --> 2375.42
and that you also go out and all that I

2370.17 --> 2379.23
don't have that anymore I'm not gonna

2375.42 --> 2381.36
get a dog there's plenty of lonely

2379.23 --> 2383.37
people out there having dogs that

2381.36 --> 2385.86
specifically have their dog because

2383.37 --> 2389.13
they're terribly lonely it's kind of

2385.86 --> 2393.6600000000003
painful to see it there's a lot of them

2389.13 --> 2395.9100000000003
out there right now that live in this

2393.66 --> 2397.71
freaking building that are incredibly

2395.91 --> 2400.56
lonely and have dogs because they are

2397.71 --> 2404.09
incredibly lonely okay I don't need a

2400.56 --> 2408.98
freaking dog it's not gonna fix anything

2404.09 --> 2408.98
besides don't ya don't have the room

2428.94 --> 2433.62
yeah well you think that I haven't

2431.01 --> 2437.1000000000004
thought about it you know that's how it

2433.62 --> 2441.99
works isn't that's how you squirt that's

2437.1 --> 2442.5899999999997
how you subtly break a code you just say

2441.99 --> 2446.79
huh

2442.59 --> 2450.8700000000003
I feel lonely right now how do I get

2446.79 --> 2455.04
this oh I'm gonna take a dog because

2450.87 --> 2457.92
then I could use that as a social excuse

2455.04 --> 2460.38
to walk up to somebody else that would

2457.92 --> 2463.98
have a dog and I could certainly roll

2460.38 --> 2468.57
out a conversation and even get back and

2463.98 --> 2469.47
do it again and then yeah am I going to

2468.57 --> 2472.02
get a dog

2469.47 --> 2476.16
just for that [ __ ] opportunity to

2472.02 --> 2479.16
arrive naturally that sounds devious to

2476.16 --> 2483.42
me then you're not taking the dog for

2479.16 --> 2487.85
the dog what's that dog the dog is just

2483.42 --> 2494.7000000000003
a tool to you it's a piece of equipment

2487.85 --> 2497.7
how if that is the way it happens you

2494.7 --> 2499.6499999999996
know if you really want a dog and you're

2497.7 --> 2502.1099999999997
like oh I love this dog you the for

2499.65 --> 2504.69
example sleeping warrior you know he has

2502.11 --> 2507.42
a dog and he loves his dog

2504.69 --> 2510.89
it really takes great that's the way to

2507.42 --> 2514.35
do it because he's doing it for the dog

2510.89 --> 2517.02
I'm not gonna get a dog because then I

2514.35 --> 2518.97
could have a opportunity to walk up to

2517.02 --> 2521.64
somebody and have a conversation oh

2518.97 --> 2524.1899999999996
that's like the worst reason ever to get

2521.64 --> 2526.7599999999998
a pet you need a pet because you want

2524.19 --> 2526.76
the pet

2531.63 --> 2542.2000000000003
don't be rude no I'm I'm listening I

2538.559 --> 2546.0890000000004
listen to your advice and then I gave

2542.2 --> 2548.6499999999996
some follow-up advice to go with that

2546.089 --> 2551.68
it's well reason now because I have

2548.65 --> 2555.7000000000003
ironically thought about that in my head

2551.68 --> 2557.9199999999996
and then I realized how crazy that would

2555.7 --> 2559.75
be to get a freaking pad just so you

2557.92 --> 2564.21
could find an excuse to walk up to

2559.75 --> 2564.21
somebody and say hello that's absurd

2572.56 --> 2577.09
the dog is having a toddler for 15 years

2575.74 --> 2579.7299999999996
I guess

2577.09 --> 2584.01
depends on the type of dog you know I I

2579.73 --> 2584.01
have no problem with dogs but you gotta

2584.52 --> 2591.34
recognize them you have gotta be with

2588.04 --> 2596.59
the dog and not just use it as some kind

2591.34 --> 2599.9500000000003
of tool as a piece of equipment to

2596.59 --> 2603.4900000000002
maneuver socially like a hat you know

2599.95 --> 2617.98
that's just disrespectful in my opinion

2603.49 --> 2621.1899999999996
to the animal you know if you want to

2617.98 --> 2624.01
look special if you want to find an

2621.19 --> 2629.2000000000003
excuse to walk up to somebody well then

2624.01 --> 2632.76
yeah wear a hat or have an interesting

2629.2 --> 2636.85
parasol or just anything that's just

2632.76 --> 2638.65
yeah that's the whole thing if you

2636.85 --> 2640.66
really want to walk up to somebody and

2638.65 --> 2644.35
just say hello start a conversation you

2640.66 --> 2651.5499999999997
gotta figure out who you are doing that

2644.35 --> 2653.8199999999997
and not just oh I want a listening ear

2651.55 --> 2656.5600000000004
and I'll do whatever it takes to get it

2653.82 --> 2659.38
because those types of ears don't really

2656.56 --> 2661.81
appreciate that it's just like a hungry

2659.38 --> 2663.19
baby screaming for attention basically

2661.81 --> 2664.81
even though it might not literally be

2663.19 --> 2667.4500000000003
screaming that's how it kind of will

2664.81 --> 2671.38
feel so but if you have something to

2667.45 --> 2678.1
offer with your attention then it's

2671.38 --> 2680.28
something else a more colored the other

2678.1 --> 2680.2799999999997
day

2682.37 --> 2691.79
keep your social distance secret goodie

2687.67 --> 2695.15
all right but yeah in a way back in the

2691.79 --> 2700.04
day when I had a little bit more money

2695.15 --> 2703.34
yeah I did have things it's like I was I

2700.04 --> 2705.38
was a goldsmith I had that I was making

2703.34 --> 2706.1600000000003
things constantly it was something to

2705.38 --> 2710.03
talk about

2706.16 --> 2712.46
it's like oh look what woman out

2710.03 --> 2716.57
especially women and not even just girls

2712.46 --> 2719.81
but women like just having a shiny thing

2716.57 --> 2722.2400000000002
to show they often love that [ __ ] I've

2719.81 --> 2725.42
had so many times that I'm just

2722.24 --> 2727.1299999999997
somewhere and a person a lot of times

2725.42 --> 2730.28
women just asked me like what's that

2727.13 --> 2735.02
what's that thing you're wearing or what

2730.28 --> 2737.3300000000004
is that ring they like it it's been yeah

2735.02 --> 2740.53
great tool for me and hey guess what

2737.33 --> 2743.36
it's a tool it's not a living thing so

2740.53 --> 2751.7900000000004
it's actually a tool that I can yeah

2743.36 --> 2761.53
that's kind of a social tool to me most

2751.79 --> 2761.5299999999997
women will office but yes I agree

2764.76 --> 2771.8
yeah I think I think I can actually

2769.02 --> 2774.54
smell that at a distance it's weird

2771.8 --> 2785.4900000000002
there's like this energy process going

2774.54 --> 2787.71
on it's so subtle how that all works but

2785.49 --> 2792.8999999999996
yeah it's not just strong masculinity

2787.71 --> 2796.43
you know it's also like control of the

2792.9 --> 2799.23
mind and the spirit really it's not just

2796.43 --> 2801.5699999999997
doing yeah

2799.23 --> 2807.66
showing off with your man muscles or

2801.57 --> 2810.869
whatever or how hairy your chest is or

2807.66 --> 2814.2
whatever it is yeah

2810.869 --> 2818.19
it's also about just the the warrior

2814.2 --> 2823.2599999999998
spirit women can see that when a man can

2818.19 --> 2826.98
really pay attention that they really

2823.26 --> 2829.5600000000004
that they're not slobs just like little

2826.98 --> 2832.53
babe yeah bearded babies hanging around

2829.56 --> 2836.16
being morons they appreciate it when a

2832.53 --> 2839.19
man is actually kind of alert and it's

2836.16 --> 2839.7599999999998
like a natural guard to them including

2839.19 --> 2844.16
them yeah

2839.76 --> 2844.1600000000003
so that also works

2851.52 --> 2857.58
all right hey Adam my dad you know with

2855.03 --> 2860.2200000000003
women as far as I've seen it's really

2857.58 --> 2864.35
also about just about their mood like

2860.22 --> 2868.74
what are they in for just looking at

2864.35 --> 2870.96
interacting with a a handsome man strong

2868.74 --> 2873.1189999999997
looking man or whatever or are they like

2870.96 --> 2875.1
in the social frenzy and they just

2873.119 --> 2877.56
looking for a target to break down and

2875.1 --> 2881.2799999999997
it's like oh that guy looks like he

2877.56 --> 2883.98
might be sexist yeah because women can

2881.28 --> 2898.8900000000003
get in that mood too it is very

2883.98 --> 2903.21
different you know I've I've been

2898.89 --> 2905.43
studying women that studying with it's

2903.21 --> 2908.54
almost like studying fauna in a way like

2905.43 --> 2911.19
I study the birds I study the women

2908.54 --> 2918.3
because they're very mysterious creature

2911.19 --> 2921.84
to me would be hilarious to just make a

2918.3 --> 2935.94
nature documentary about women classic

2921.84 --> 2943.859
BBC style but seriously that would be

2935.94 --> 2948.02
really funny birds they call women birds

2943.859 --> 2948.02
in England that's right that's right

2950.0 --> 2960.09
it's incredible isn't it how that all

2952.619 --> 2963.81
works the words Wow how would you call

2960.09 --> 2966.3500000000004
that Fanny that's it's kind of rude on a

2963.81 --> 2966.35
plane

2971.369 --> 2980.2200000000003
you will get a lot of feminist writing

2975.529 --> 2982.109
again a lot of those looks of women that

2980.22 --> 2984.5989999999997
are like really pissed off about

2982.109 --> 2986.94
something somebody said on social media

2984.599 --> 2990.9300000000003
or like a troll that they couldn't just

2986.94 --> 2994.109
ban and yeah certain types can get so

2990.93 --> 2997.23
upset that they'll be like fiery dragons

2994.109 --> 3000.14
looking out there for a target to be

2997.23 --> 3003.23
angry at and they look at me and I'm

3000.14 --> 3005.69
like looking back at them not scared

3003.23 --> 3010.45
just like wow yeah you're really pissed

3005.69 --> 3010.4500000000003
off aren't you and they're like oh yeah

3011.14 --> 3016.0389999999998
then they're never gonna like to step up

3013.94 --> 3017.9
to me because I'm not a [ __ ] I'm not

3016.039 --> 3020.029
afraid of when they're in that mood I

3017.9 --> 3021.92
know exactly what it is I kind of

3020.029 --> 3024.71
sympathize with them even though it is

3021.92 --> 3028.4
annoying because I've been in that mood

3024.71 --> 3030.529
as well you know sometimes trolls really

3028.4 --> 3035.21
do get to me and I'm like seething ly

3030.529 --> 3041.029
mad like get FOMA in the mouth like this

3035.21 --> 3043.67
is a kind of like the that the members

3041.029 --> 3045.68
only show that I uploaded last night if

3043.67 --> 3049.67
you haven't watched that you got to see

3045.68 --> 3051.89
that like Jackie just overemphasis me it

3049.67 --> 3055.13
was a pretty heated conversation overall

3051.89 --> 3059.6299999999997
and not just me it was also some others

3055.13 --> 3062.839
it was pretty intense but yeah Jackie

3059.63 --> 3066.049
just was just being lame chill and over

3062.839 --> 3069.14
like asking a question then I answered

3066.049 --> 3073.48
the question and I literally start rum

3069.14 --> 3077.47
passing me after a few seconds with how

3073.48 --> 3085.16
I'm not answering the question

3077.47 --> 3087.5589999999997
like the [ __ ] dude seriously like get as

3085.16 --> 3089.359
you are trying to answer you get rum

3087.559 --> 3090.529
pissed with him complaining that you're

3089.359 --> 3096.0389999999998
not answering the question

3090.529 --> 3096.039
ah anyway

3099.85 --> 3104.29
yeah and that'll get you really pissed

3102.05 --> 3104.29
off

3109.37 --> 3113.93
[Music]

3111.4 --> 3117.03
who

3113.93 --> 3119.04
yeah Neil but chai keys just janky but

3117.03 --> 3122.52
anyway I got a wrench in there now

3119.04 --> 3125.94
I got handed a wrench and I yeah I have

3122.52 --> 3128.64
some more control it's I'm very happy

3125.94 --> 3133.05
because I can also use that for yeah for

3128.64 --> 3136.77
my streams it's like this is really

3133.05 --> 3140.4300000000003
awesome and I'm thankful that I'm

3136.77 --> 3142.91
allowed to have this because QE was also

3140.43 --> 3142.91
alright with it

3148.609 --> 3155.8199999999997
you even yelled at him Neal well I think

3151.32 --> 3158.52
a lot of people yell at him what show it

3155.82 --> 3164.76
was a members-only upload amanda you

3158.52 --> 3167.49
from from last evening let's see I can

3164.76 --> 3171.119
put it in chat but if you if you have

3167.49 --> 3175.31
trouble navigating then I suggest you go

3171.119 --> 3180.83
to my playlists and there is a member's

3175.31 --> 3183.54
special section there and I upload every

3180.83 --> 3185.7799999999997
member special members-only video in

3183.54 --> 3185.7799999999997
there

3186.17 --> 3194.09
but I'll link you up in the chat so you

3189.45 --> 3194.0899999999997
can watch that only if you remember now

3194.9 --> 3201.33
I'm really trying to make people to come

3197.76 --> 3204.3590000000004
make people become members not because I

3201.33 --> 3206.58
even want the money or whatever you know

3204.359 --> 3212.46
take the minimum I just like the idea

3206.58 --> 3214.859
that I can have a next tier like this is

3212.46 --> 3219.18
the public this is the the OL public

3214.859 --> 3221.2799999999997
show but yeah sometimes there's I have

3219.18 --> 3224.69
moods to get a little bit more hardcore

3221.28 --> 3227.55
and more interactive with ballers

3224.69 --> 3232.68
verbally and yeah I like to do that on

3227.55 --> 3235.3500000000004
this court these days and I record it so

3232.68 --> 3243.4199999999996
check it out the link is in the chat

3235.35 --> 3246.42
right now it's 35 minutes like it's not

3243.42 --> 3248.46
as focused as some of the previous

3246.42 --> 3251.869
upload but I still thought it was an

3248.46 --> 3251.869
interesting conversation

3255.619 --> 3260.089
hmm now I know mark Collard thank you

3258.619 --> 3262.67
for saying that by the way I do

3260.089 --> 3266.119
appreciate that because sometimes it is

3262.67 --> 3268.309
difficult to accept it but the

3266.119 --> 3272.239
membership I like the membership system

3268.309 --> 3275.9
specifically because I can do members

3272.239 --> 3280.029
only video streams because yeah then all

3275.9 --> 3284.2690000000002
the trolls the trolls can't just scour

3280.029 --> 3287.45
my stream and like rip [ __ ] from that to

3284.269 --> 3289.8799999999997
try you make some dumb ridiculing video

3287.45 --> 3292.16
or whatever they can do that unless they

3289.88 --> 3295.359
literally pay me and that's okay you

3292.16 --> 3298.64
know pay to troll I like that idea

3295.359 --> 3301.069
you want to troll me that's okay you

3298.64 --> 3304.819
gotta pay and then you can try to troll

3301.069 --> 3307.19
me I like that idea

3304.819 --> 3309.71
pay to troll like you wanna troll that's

3307.19 --> 3314.079
fine but you're gonna pay there's a

3309.71 --> 3314.079
price I think it should be like that

3321.45 --> 3326.97
all right and oh you think trolls don't

3326.099 --> 3331.23
have any money

3326.97 --> 3335.299
think again it's often like rich people

3331.23 --> 3335.299
that have too much time on their hands

3335.75 --> 3349.16
so troll toll yeah that's right

3349.83 --> 3353.0
[Music]

3357.68 --> 3369.89
especially when trolls want you to pay

3360.39 --> 3369.89
to pass their bridges yeah that story

3370.97 --> 3378.18
now that's a classic like the concept of

3375.839 --> 3380.16
trolls being at bridges and trying to

3378.18 --> 3384.1189999999997
make you pay to get across that's like a

3380.16 --> 3387.5099999999998
classic thing right like that that even

3384.119 --> 3388.8900000000003
exists in in an old game well my

3387.51 --> 3391.1090000000004
favorite one of my favorites from

3388.89 --> 3393.42
baldur's gate they had that like some

3391.109 --> 3397.25
other though they were ogres there are

3393.42 --> 3400.67
literally two ogres on the bridge and

3397.25 --> 3406.2
yeah you can try to converse with them

3400.67 --> 3408.299
to get across but they want you to pay

3406.2 --> 3412.3799999999997
but you can just be like nah I think

3408.299 --> 3414.299
it's too much money na na Mae and then

3412.38 --> 3416.6400000000003
end up literally saying now I think I'm

3414.299 --> 3419.7599999999998
not gonna pay at all but then they get

3416.64 --> 3424.73
into a fight with you it's I don't know

3419.76 --> 3424.73
it's a weird little moment

3430.55 --> 3435.98
if Forgotten Realms love Forgotten

3433.04 --> 3440.48
Realms yeah that's that's why that is

3435.98 --> 3442.52
from that's right if yeah if the game

3440.48 --> 3447.77
says anything to you yeah that specific

3442.52 --> 3451.82
scenario is at the the ruins were the

3447.77 --> 3455.27
Noles which are like hyena men literally

3451.82 --> 3460.52
like humans with hyena hats very weird

3455.27 --> 3464.06
nose they're like they capita they

3460.52 --> 3466.67
captured a a wizard woman and you're

3464.06 --> 3471.25
trying to rescue her with the a defamed

3466.67 --> 3475.369
character of baldur's gate Minsk the

3471.25 --> 3477.74
Ranger Berserker and then you get to

3475.369 --> 3484.94
that bridge right before you get into

3477.74 --> 3487.3999999999996
the the ruins anyway they have a crop of

3484.94 --> 3491.98
winners in my yard with the five new

3487.4 --> 3495.2000000000003
transplants okay hmm

3491.98 --> 3497.72
okay so you're still going going because

3495.2 --> 3499.7
I heard the weather was really bad is

3497.72 --> 3502.6
that is that starting to recover a

3499.7 --> 3502.6
little Missouri bear

3511.619 --> 3517.88
requiem dream are you like literally

3514.859 --> 3520.2599999999998
doing your best to get banned now

3517.88 --> 3522.2400000000002
because I don't know why you're saying

3520.26 --> 3524.9
that and then even trying to draw my

3522.24 --> 3524.8999999999996
attention to it

3531.07 --> 3537.04
yeah so reckon with a dream like hey you

3534.16 --> 3540.6099999999997
want to help me out right yeah you

3537.04 --> 3545.56
donate to my paypal just like the rest

3540.61 --> 3548.6800000000003
the more I get donations the better my

3545.56 --> 3551.0499999999997
life will be I don't need your advice

3548.68 --> 3553.12
that you think it would be so much

3551.05 --> 3555.3700000000003
better for me if I just step away from

3553.12 --> 3560.29
all this all this what I've build up my

3555.37 --> 3564.64
legacy here my presence my yeah

3560.29 --> 3566.86
notoriety in a way and infamy on the

3564.64 --> 3573.8799999999997
baller side I need to step away from all

3566.86 --> 3577.57
that do I because that would be better

3573.88 --> 3581.17
for me in order to do what why would i

3577.57 --> 3583.3300000000004
accomplish by stepping away now where

3581.17 --> 3585.16
would my life go I don't think it'll go

3583.33 --> 3588.61
any better I think I'd get really

3585.16 --> 3591.73
freaking isolated all of a sudden I'd

3588.61 --> 3593.8
lose an entire group of people that I

3591.73 --> 3595.69
know on the internet and that know me

3593.8 --> 3597.82
and that expect me to be there and and

3595.69 --> 3601.29
then what just drop away like that

thank you very much Stephanie

4189.27 --> 4192.899
[Music]

4199.13 --> 4202.13
yeah

4211.36 --> 4216.03
only ever made one even your life Adam

4224.51 --> 4230.62
in Lumina lodge a man of the fields hmm

4265.14 --> 4268.189
[Music]

4269.01 --> 4273.54
yeah where do we go from here you know

4276.96 --> 4283.33
it's kind of weird because with the

4280.24 --> 4288.79
baller situation what they do now what

4283.33 --> 4290.68
is bring being brought out like there

4288.79 --> 4293.71
there's always gonna be some ballers

4290.68 --> 4296.08
that are trying to push back and retain

4293.71 --> 4297.55
the dream you know so no matter what

4296.08 --> 4300.55
there's always gonna be plenty of

4297.55 --> 4303.04
interaction that's also what we get

4300.55 --> 4307.39
seeing the debates and in the panels in

4303.04 --> 4311.92
discord it's not recording but yeah

4307.39 --> 4315.72
separate it just just on our own it's

4311.92 --> 4318.7300000000005
like yeah that's this giant sea of peace

4315.72 --> 4323.25
because we freaking won there's a Black

4318.73 --> 4326.169999999999
Swan and the ballers ain't coming back

4323.25 --> 4331.2
so you then end up either with the

4326.17 --> 4335.5
infighting nonsense or basically putting

4331.2 --> 4337.87
yeah extreme weirdo ballers on pedestals

4335.5 --> 4342.4
to fool with it you have to make them

4337.87 --> 4344.32
look the fool that they really are but

4342.4 --> 4346.78
yeah they're gonna be doing most of it

4344.32 --> 4348.94
themselves and yeah that's it's just

4346.78 --> 4354.3
like oh look yeah we've won we've won

4348.94 --> 4359.5599999999995
like really really won like absolutely

4354.3 --> 4363.85
like with the it's all right of glory

4359.56 --> 4366.490000000001
and all we've won the earth is flat and

4363.85 --> 4369.43
contained and there's a lot of mystery

4366.49 --> 4371.53
about it there's heavy signs of a

4369.43 --> 4375.97
similar Tory nature in many different

4371.53 --> 4378.429999999999
aspects and some people are taking that

4375.97 --> 4382.45
to the max I'm saying it's all simulated

4378.43 --> 4385.4800000000005
and then other people are like yeah just

4382.45 --> 4389.03
digging through all that but yeah we've

4385.48 --> 4393.909
won the earth is definitely flat

4389.03 --> 4398.42
and the mind of people seems to be

4393.909 --> 4401.049999999999
extremely flexible in such weird ways

4398.42 --> 4405.4400000000005
that we can be made to believe

4401.05 --> 4409.219
absolutely absurd things and then go

4405.44 --> 4413.7699999999995
with that and like stick with that as a

4409.219 --> 4417.61
principle stick with the absurdity and

4413.77 --> 4420.079000000001
that's like psychological reveal is

4417.61 --> 4424.19
probably the weirdest of all it's not

4420.079 --> 4428.15
the world that is weird its man its

4424.19 --> 4431.239
mankind the people that are actually

4428.15 --> 4436.219
that weirdness it's the people that are

4431.239 --> 4441.44
freaking insane for real it's not the

4436.219 --> 4444.8
world even so the world is made to look

4441.44 --> 4451.989
crazier than it really is because of the

4444.8 --> 4455.51
people that make it look that crazy and

4451.989 --> 4459.28
illusions are presented as real and then

4455.51 --> 4463.030000000001
by persistence and by show of force and

4459.28 --> 4466.009999999999
power of money and presence and status

4463.03 --> 4469.13
the lie is just perpetuated and

4466.01 --> 4472.34
reinforced like a trophy over reality

4469.13 --> 4476.36
like literally flying with a banner like

4472.34 --> 4478.400000000001
yes see we made this lie into a reality

4476.36 --> 4483.308999999999
and everyone is accepting it we've

4478.4 --> 4487.339999999999
conquered the truth it's like a ritual

4483.309 --> 4489.59
just showing off your lies like look we

4487.34 --> 4493.01
are making this lie it's echoing

4489.59 --> 4495.4400000000005
everywhere everyone now is going along

4493.01 --> 4498.650000000001
with this even though it is a lie and

4495.44 --> 4500.48
everybody should know that but it's not

4498.65 --> 4505.0
about whether it's the truth or not it's

4500.48 --> 4508.28
about whether you will go along with it

4505.0 --> 4510.94
despite it being a lie that's what it's

4508.28 --> 4510.94
all about now

4547.19 --> 4563.849999999999
well that sounds incredible good servant

4554.01 --> 4567.41
Oh Mia Mia de hein Giada hein is that

4563.85 --> 4567.410000000001
Mikan in Gaelic

4596.809 --> 4606.349
ah yeah nauseas gone by the way very you

4604.489 --> 4609.579
do notice it read this like as soon as a

4606.349 --> 4615.13
situation stabilizes it's just I start

4609.579 --> 4615.13
being my usual self again very quickly

4620.21 --> 4623.829
[Music]

4633.949 --> 4641.469
right anyway it's Sunday isn't it yeah

4639.85 --> 4645.410000000001
it's weird

4641.469 --> 4647.57
yesterday everybody or Friday everybody

4645.41 --> 4652.37
was telling me like they felt it was

4647.57 --> 4654.94
Saturday and today I feel like what is

4652.37 --> 4658.16
this Sunday know it feels like Saturday

4654.94 --> 4661.4
it's I don't know maybe it's just the

4658.16 --> 4664.699
freaking energy in the heat maybe that

4661.4 --> 4667.3099999999995
does something not just to our social

4664.699 --> 4670.339999999999
mechanisms when we interact with one

4667.31 --> 4675.650000000001
another but also with I don't know some

4670.34 --> 4679.33
of our intuitive sensories are our

4675.65 --> 4679.33
fine-tuned mint clock maybe

4713.06 --> 4716.06
Swigert

4729.36 --> 4732.86
no that's Squidward

4734.96 --> 4738.25
that's Swaggart

4742.91 --> 4746.98
or is this some other character

4752.47 --> 4758.14
why are we talking about spongebob again

4755.24 --> 4758.139999999999
what is this

4783.93 --> 4790.740000000001
yeah hey ed um could you please not do

4786.75 --> 4793.64
the caps got you several times now

4790.74 --> 4793.639999999999
please don't do that

4823.54 --> 4827.8
that why are you putting it on in the

4825.64 --> 4831.490000000001
first place you know you should

4827.8 --> 4833.68
literally remove the caps lock key just

4831.49 --> 4837.58
remove it from your keyboard don't use

4833.68 --> 4839.530000000001
it don't ever use it just ever feel if

4837.58 --> 4841.8099999999995
you want to have a capital letter use

4839.53 --> 4846.4
the shift and then you let it go you

4841.81 --> 4849.450000000001
don't need caps lock ever ATM just get

4846.4 --> 4849.45
it off your keyboard

4879.16 --> 4885.33
[Music]

4881.01 --> 4887.97
all right so maybe some flat earth it's

4885.33 --> 4891.74
a subject this seems to be like one of

4887.97 --> 4899.1
the slowest shows I've had in months

4891.74 --> 4902.3099999999995
it's incredible like I think a rocket

4899.1 --> 4904.83
thing was brought up and that's pretty

4902.31 --> 4909.330000000001
much it and then proceeded talking about

4904.83 --> 4911.25
I don't know girls and relation

4909.33 --> 4917.48
interactions and the weather and all

4911.25 --> 4919.44
that and Sponge Bob characters now and

4917.48 --> 4920.49
yeah there's not a lot of Flat Earth

4919.44 --> 4923.28
going on anymore

4920.49 --> 4927.41
I don't know what is maybe people maybe

4923.28 --> 4927.41
you guys are just all sick of it

4934.389 --> 4939.369
yeah and also I've noticed that just all

4936.85 --> 4945.0
like literally all the flat earthers out

4939.369 --> 4945.0
there that are trying to build models

4945.239 --> 4949.089999999999
yeah they're they're all pretty much

4947.86 --> 4952.15
reaching a dead end

4949.09 --> 4955.27
they all are they're all caught in two

4952.15 --> 4957.46
presuppositions at some point they just

4955.27 --> 4959.110000000001
get caught into it's like yeah if we

4957.46 --> 4961.63
want the model is out further then we

4959.11 --> 4965.739
have to presuppose this and that's it

4961.63 --> 4968.56
and that just they stay in the same foot

4965.739 --> 4971.879999999999
position it's funny in a way because

4968.56 --> 4975.1
when I started out my thing on YouTube I

4971.88 --> 4978.13
put forth the rectangular looping stuff

4975.1 --> 4981.34
and the holographic globe of the heavens

4978.13 --> 4984.159000000001
that word even that terminology I put

4981.34 --> 4986.409000000001
that out like instantly just did it just

4984.159 --> 4988.86
like that everybody made thought I was

4986.409 --> 4991.83
just literally trolling and crazy

4988.86 --> 4993.869
literally like people that are now

4991.83 --> 4997.179
fellow flat-earthers

4993.869 --> 5000.54
at first like Nathan thought I was

4997.179 --> 5002.76
literally insane okay that's not a joke

5000.54 --> 5005.909
that was not him joking he thought I was

5002.76 --> 5008.070000000001
crazy because I was just saying things

5005.909 --> 5010.71
that were sounding like they were way

5008.07 --> 5013.799999999999
out there in the mean time I've

5010.71 --> 5014.52
explained it all now we understand so

5013.8 --> 5017.429
what I meant

5014.52 --> 5021.179
and he notices that I am very persistent

5017.429 --> 5025.1990000000005
that I'm constant it's not just a random

5021.179 --> 5029.909
story that I've just changed or that I'm

5025.199 --> 5033.21
like being dishonest about but for my

5029.909 --> 5035.5199999999995
timing it was crazy it was like way

5033.21 --> 5038.909
further out there that anybody could

5035.52 --> 5042.570000000001
just generally attend suggested so many

5038.909 --> 5045.15
steps ahead it's just too much for

5042.57 --> 5047.07
people to grab grab hold of that at the

5045.15 --> 5049.739
time but I did it and I've been

5047.07 --> 5052.7699999999995
extremely persistent and the funny thing

5049.739 --> 5056.3099999999995
is wherever people grabbed their bar

5052.77 --> 5058.59
like where they want to be spending them

5056.31 --> 5063.570000000001
their energy and time on within the

5058.59 --> 5067.409000000001
subject reach range they've all kind of

5063.57 --> 5072.079
stuck to the same level

5067.409 --> 5076.949
and kept recycling kept on doing that

5072.079 --> 5080.239
trying it again so in a way everybody's

5076.949 --> 5084.15
kind of doing that but yeah what's the

5080.239 --> 5088.32
like the a real true progress other than

5084.15 --> 5092.159
just further refined details on how we

5088.32 --> 5096.03
absolutely demolished any kind of global

5092.159 --> 5098.369
religion nonsense like by their actions

5096.03 --> 5100.289
not even ours like we don't even have to

5098.369 --> 5104.639
do anything we just have to let the

5100.289 --> 5106.768999999999
ballers just create spiritual seppuku

5104.639 --> 5109.499
right on the spot by their own action

5106.769 --> 5114.959
and just catch it that's what we freakin

5109.499 --> 5117.599
do now just make them humiliate

5114.959 --> 5120.599
themselves and they're doing it they are

5117.599 --> 5123.32
doing it not we they are doing it we

5120.599 --> 5126.32
just have to highlight what is

5123.32 --> 5126.32
humiliating

5132.37 --> 5138.29
right now yell ballers they're always

5135.56 --> 5139.88
gonna stay just reasserting blind

5138.29 --> 5141.53
assertions because that's always what

5139.88 --> 5143.54
they've done is that they have they're

5141.53 --> 5146.15
just so story that's not proof or not

5143.54 --> 5148.76
really backed and then they keep on

5146.15 --> 5150.7699999999995
repeating that story just keep keep on

5148.76 --> 5152.54
telling it like a fairy tale and if you

5150.77 --> 5154.46
hear it enough times everybody will know

5152.54 --> 5156.44
the fairy tale they'll not know whether

5154.46 --> 5157.58
it is absolutely real or not but they'll

5156.44 --> 5160.07
know this story

5157.58 --> 5163.3099999999995
they'll recognize it and they'll accept

5160.07 --> 5166.549999999999
it as being normal whether it was true

5163.31 --> 5168.71
or not that's that doesn't even have to

5166.55 --> 5171.08
reach their consciousness no they just

5168.71 --> 5174.41
know it and they accept it because they

5171.08 --> 5179.74
know it the familiarity is more

5174.41 --> 5186.5
important than the truth about it

5179.74 --> 5189.639999999999
effectively it's crazy how that works so

5186.5 --> 5191.84
yeah people they will just keep on

5189.64 --> 5194.26
rehashing the same story over and over

5191.84 --> 5197.42
again you smash it again thoroughly

5194.26 --> 5199.42
absolute detail complete smashing of the

5197.42 --> 5203.75
argument that is not even an argument

5199.42 --> 5204.53
from the baller side just disproving

5203.75 --> 5208.16
their nonsense

5204.53 --> 5210.62
and yeah they squirt a little they go

5208.16 --> 5212.0
complaining pants and they attack the

5210.62 --> 5215.03
man they start complaining about

5212.0 --> 5219.02
moderation bla bla bla and then the next

5215.03 --> 5222.19
day and it starts all over again now

5219.02 --> 5225.35
that kind of used to take a month

5222.19 --> 5230.629999999999
some like baller would like get into a

5225.35 --> 5233.360000000001
big situation big head had to had debate

5230.63 --> 5238.82
and they would get smashed and then take

5233.36 --> 5243.44
a long time but they're now settled with

5238.82 --> 5247.25
that they will constantly lose like an

5243.44 --> 5248.96
unwinnable fight that they have no other

5247.25 --> 5251.75
choice then to continue doing that

5248.96 --> 5255.22
because they can't accept that they're

5251.75 --> 5257.63
wrong and they're dibala's are just

5255.22 --> 5260.51
conditioning themselves to be okay with

5257.63 --> 5263.63
being humiliated constantly it's like

5260.51 --> 5265.02
their thing now yes we are believers we

5263.63 --> 5269.34
believe in

5265.02 --> 5272.22
science and what we see on TV and we can

5269.34 --> 5275.28
even get a logical argument together we

5272.22 --> 5278.43
don't even know what science is but we

5275.28 --> 5280.92
feel very brave when we stick up for the

5278.43 --> 5282.780000000001
world and get completely smashed in

5280.92 --> 5284.7
every form of argumentation that you

5282.78 --> 5287.16
tried to bring forth to prove our ball

5284.7 --> 5289.26
get completely smashed but it's ok

5287.16 --> 5291.5599999999995
because we're doing it for the ball

5289.26 --> 5294.72
we're doing it for Earth which we

5291.56 --> 5297.77
literally think is the ball so we're

5294.72 --> 5299.55
doing it for it all for our virtual

5297.77 --> 5301.080000000001
representation of what we think the

5299.55 --> 5303.3
earth is like even though we have

5301.08 --> 5305.49
absolutely no proof for it and that's

5303.3 --> 5307.9800000000005
what they're doing now it's just yeah

5305.49 --> 5311.4
they're okay with being constantly

5307.98 --> 5313.23
humiliated worse and worse and worse and

5311.4 --> 5313.799999999999
they're okay with it now it's the new

5313.23 --> 5315.599999999999
normal

5313.8 --> 5318.150000000001
