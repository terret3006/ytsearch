6.48 --> 37.799
foreign

7.92 --> 37.799
[Music]

59.899 --> 65.06

and yeah you can always use the support

96.06 --> 99.96000000000001
shout out to dank for the PayPal

98.7 --> 102.119
yesterday

99.96 --> 104.579
during the Flat Earth debate

102.119 --> 107.0
that was great

104.579 --> 107.0
right

107.759 --> 114.659
whether today is yeah

111.6 --> 117.86
a little less cloudy than yesterday

114.659 --> 117.86
there's barely any wind

120.54 --> 123.5
and uh

126.299 --> 131.58
it was actually kind of nice had to

129.06 --> 135.92000000000002
smoke here on the balcony and it's like

131.58 --> 135.92000000000002
wow it's not cold at all really

139.319 --> 143.54
also because it's just a wind still

145.5 --> 150.26
anyway

147.06 --> 150.26
it's pretty nice day

157.379 --> 162.42
right

159.599 --> 166.85999999999999
so it's Saturday the

162.42 --> 166.85999999999999
4th of February 2023

168.44 --> 173.819
ah and for some reason the chat is on

171.599 --> 176.66
top again

173.819 --> 176.66
let's see

177.9 --> 184.4
yes the day was down

181.14 --> 184.39999999999998
you make sense of it

186.239 --> 192.0
anyway uh

189.54 --> 195.85999999999999
yeah let's check the temperature it's

192.0 --> 195.86
probably around 10 degrees or something

197.4 --> 200.239
11. oh

201.599 --> 206.51899999999998
all right

204.0 --> 208.56
but cloudy

206.519 --> 210.12
and then according to the predictions is

208.56 --> 212.04
actually going to get more sunny but

210.12 --> 216.14000000000001
colder

212.04 --> 216.14
in the course of the next week

217.26 --> 221.94
and colder at night too

219.659 --> 226.099
right so it's probably part of the

221.94 --> 226.099
clouding and lack of wind

227.34 --> 232.519
that is basically keeping it relatively

230.099 --> 232.51899999999998
warm

234.9 --> 237.62
anyway

239.519 --> 243.019
right yesterday

247.019 --> 251.36
whatever Flat Earth debates

251.76 --> 256.44
what's interesting yeah

253.98 --> 258.359
I was very late oh late I went out for

256.44 --> 261.479
groceries and that took a long time I

258.359 --> 263.15999999999997
basically missed the entire live show

261.479 --> 265.62
so

263.16 --> 268.02000000000004
it's not a big part of that

265.62 --> 270.36
uh

268.02 --> 273.71999999999997
but the after show was fun I hung around

270.36 --> 277.38
very long afterward although most guys

273.72 --> 281.47900000000004
kind of dropped pretty early but

277.38 --> 281.479
it was a good ending to the week

282.36 --> 285.42900000000003
[Music]

290.58 --> 294.08
missed Jim Bob's yesterday

295.56 --> 299.34
uh

296.94 --> 301.82
but I did see another one of those uh

299.34 --> 301.82
shows

301.86 --> 307.68
from the Han experience and geoshifter

305.639 --> 309.24
was in there too in the chat so that was

307.68 --> 311.46
fun

309.24 --> 314.84000000000003
but I mean yeah it is

311.46 --> 314.84
it's a really different

315.36 --> 321.3
way of doing a show it's interesting

317.699 --> 323.1
it's and it is very Dutch in its own way

321.3 --> 325.5
but

323.1 --> 327.72
he plays a lot of English clips and he

325.5 --> 331.699
subtitles them

327.72 --> 331.699
like on-screen subtitle

332.52 --> 336.79999999999995
wonder how he does that if he does it

334.44 --> 341.039
like manually translated or if he Auto

336.8 --> 343.56
may go maybe maybe Google Translate

341.039 --> 344.4
the voices and then just put that under

343.56 --> 348.539
there

344.4 --> 352.19899999999996
because otherwise he'd be at it for a

348.539 --> 355.08
while he plays a lot of videos

352.199 --> 358.28000000000003
anyway hey akumu virus

355.08 --> 358.28
what Vietnam

361.52 --> 366.35999999999996
and first in chat hello

369.84 --> 375.61999999999995
I was on time for a change I guess

372.36 --> 375.62
people aren't used to that

389.52 --> 393.74
how's my morning yeah pretty good

395.16 --> 402.12
I mean this is this weird feeling like a

398.819 --> 404.16
very preliminary feeling of spring

402.12 --> 405.9
in the air

404.16 --> 408.24
today

405.9 --> 409.979
but like a very vague hint of it but

408.24 --> 412.28000000000003
even that very vague hint is very

409.979 --> 412.28
welcome

413.3 --> 417.42900000000003
[Music]

420.84 --> 426.10999999999996
also there's probably new farmer

423.539 --> 427.8
protests coming here in the Netherlands

426.11 --> 432.139
[Music]

427.8 --> 432.139
certain Clips have been popping up

435.66 --> 441.66
that

438.3 --> 443.639
like what that very that beautiful Dutch

441.66 --> 447.47900000000004
woman

443.639 --> 451.08
yeah terawatt names

447.479 --> 453.9
basically had a call out like

451.08 --> 456.25899999999996
we're losing farmers are losing we need

453.9 --> 456.25899999999996
your help

457.199 --> 460.88
oh

458.34 --> 460.88
beautiful

462.66 --> 468.78000000000003
so that's probably gonna happen

465.9 --> 472.19899999999996
and I I still support the farmers even

468.78 --> 474.65999999999997
though it's mostly by word

472.199 --> 476.639
because I'm not really a on the street

474.66 --> 479.759
protest kind of guy

476.639 --> 482.479
unless I just entirely sure it's

479.759 --> 482.47900000000004
peaceful because

482.58 --> 485.71999999999997
I don't know man

485.88 --> 490.919
if things got like Rowdy I don't know

488.099 --> 493.56
what would happen to me I could get like

490.919 --> 495.71999999999997
I've had pretty

493.56 --> 497.699
extreme experience in the past where I

495.72 --> 500.52000000000004
would basically just get

497.699 --> 502.8
over invested in the group and then do

500.52 --> 506.099
crazy things

502.8 --> 509.46000000000004
like go too far because I'm like

506.099 --> 511.44
it's like it possesses me so

509.46 --> 513.7189999999999
but that's yeah I don't know it's

511.44 --> 515.3389999999999
basically part of my experience since

513.719 --> 517.7
school because that's typically the

515.339 --> 520.979
thing that went wrong back then

517.7 --> 523.979
and because I don't know I just get

520.979 --> 527.279
really excited well not really excited

523.979 --> 531.9590000000001
as in hyperactive but just like

527.279 --> 535.019
I've been to a few protests in my time

531.959 --> 537.899
and with one I would even like

535.019 --> 540.6
get pick up it was like a sort of open

537.899 --> 542.1
thing and people could basically grab

540.6 --> 543.899
the mic and talk to an audience it

542.1 --> 545.64
wasn't that many people it was like a

543.899 --> 548.36
society it was more like a political

545.64 --> 548.36
thing I think

548.459 --> 551.42
but I just

552.3 --> 556.56
okay

553.68 --> 560.88
I'm afraid that if I show up I I'd

556.56 --> 563.2199999999999
really like get possessed again and just

560.88 --> 565.56
maybe put myself a little bit too much

563.22 --> 567.6600000000001
out there

565.56 --> 570.18
and maybe that would get a really bad

567.66 --> 574.019
reaction too because

570.18 --> 576.4799999999999
I am really like so sick of

574.019 --> 579.019
the pacifism really even though it's

576.48 --> 579.019
necessary

581.88 --> 587.279
right but yeah you've seen me uh

584.279 --> 589.5
basically show that type of behavior in

587.279 --> 591.42
the past where I'm just I go ragewind

589.5 --> 593.6
well I've only really done that on the

591.42 --> 593.5999999999999
internet

593.82 --> 597.0
so

595.2 --> 600.6
but I mean

597.0 --> 603.26
if for example like theoretically if I'd

600.6 --> 606.899
just be walking and some really terrible

603.26 --> 608.76
attitude police like and they have like

606.899 --> 610.44
I can feel their hour I can see that

608.76 --> 612.6
there's like a black thing that goes

610.44 --> 615.6600000000001
over some people when they intend to do

612.6 --> 617.519
bad things and they know it

615.66 --> 620.2199999999999
right

617.519 --> 622.08
and they start assaulting people that

620.22 --> 624.24
are like obviously really nice or

622.08 --> 626.339
something like dude I'd go

624.24 --> 629.94
ape [ __ ] on that

626.339 --> 632.82
and I'm not a really big heavy guy that

629.94 --> 638.36
would like bash them up but I I probably

632.82 --> 638.36
like go Savage and that's not good

639.3 --> 644.64
because yeah that'll get me absolutely

642.06 --> 647.64
arrested and all that and then I my life

644.64 --> 650.24
would be probably over

647.64 --> 650.24
ugh

655.44 --> 661.2
because I can get like extremely

658.32 --> 664.44
defensive of people that I like

661.2 --> 667.019
in action situations it's it is a

664.44 --> 669.3000000000001
defense mechanism too it's

667.019 --> 670.579
I mean

669.3 --> 674.4799999999999
yeah

670.579 --> 677.04
I suspect it might be like sort of an

674.48 --> 679.74
Indonesian Instinct because it feels

677.04 --> 683.24
like that and it was earlier Associated

679.74 --> 683.24
that attitude with that

684.12 --> 687.92
but I mean that that

687.959 --> 691.8
modus operandi the way of going about

690.36 --> 695.1
with that

691.8 --> 697.019
must work really well like in Jungle

695.1 --> 699.66
environments

697.019 --> 702.42
where literally just a bunch of songs

699.66 --> 704.3389999999999
can suddenly just roll up and start like

702.42 --> 707.0999999999999
killing and raping

704.339 --> 709.86
and that's exactly what this instinct is

707.1 --> 711.9590000000001
meant for is to like Savage counter

709.86 --> 713.64
response subtly like

711.959 --> 714.8389999999999
like that

713.64 --> 718.14
but

714.839 --> 720.48
yeah I mean in protests it's not exactly

718.14 --> 724.5
the same scenario although well the the

720.48 --> 726.44
likeness of the energy of like people re

724.5 --> 728.16
like uh

726.44 --> 730.74
infiltrators

728.16 --> 732.36
or antifa people that suddenly just

730.74 --> 733.86
start attacking the police and then the

732.36 --> 736.019
police attack

733.86 --> 737.94
the real protesters that sort of thing

736.019 --> 740.779
right

737.94 --> 743.519
it does resemble the energy to a degree

740.779 --> 745.32
and that's why that instinct will be

743.519 --> 748.339
very seduced

745.32 --> 748.339
to initiate

750.6 --> 754.8000000000001
right so there's another reason why I'm

752.64 --> 757.76
not like very eager to always join

754.8 --> 757.76
protests because

757.98 --> 762.66
foreign

759.98 --> 765.3000000000001
the more time progresses the more

762.66 --> 767.519
likelihood of these kind of in inter

765.3 --> 772.079
infractions

767.519 --> 774.9590000000001
happening with thus risk for me to

772.079 --> 777.779
yeah get out of that in a bad way either

774.959 --> 779.6999999999999
way because even if I didn't do that I'd

777.779 --> 781.32
still I then I start feeling like a

779.7 --> 783.6
coward for not doing that you see

781.32 --> 785.94
instinctually

783.6 --> 787.9200000000001
I'd feel humiliated for that happening

785.94 --> 789.12
in me not doing anything about it you

787.92 --> 792.56
see

789.12 --> 792.5600000000001
and that's not good either

801.06 --> 804.06
ah

805.079 --> 811.5
I can send you some Rogan PNG okay okay

808.5 --> 814.44
there it but I want a thumb

811.5 --> 816.6
with little headphones on it

814.44 --> 819.5400000000001
and I know they're out there

816.6 --> 821.639
little headphones and and a very basic

819.54 --> 824.279
smiley face I know they're out there I

821.639 --> 828.12
think I've already seen them

824.279 --> 830.9399999999999
photos of that as a joke

828.12 --> 833.88
probably from like Bears during when

830.94 --> 837.139
Owen Benjamin really rolled out to the

833.88 --> 837.139
Rogan system

839.3 --> 843.899
but it has to have a headphone because

841.62 --> 845.4590000000001
Rogan is always wearing those headphones

843.899 --> 849.18
during his stream so that's how

845.459 --> 850.9799999999999
everybody recognizes it immediately if

849.18 --> 853.3199999999999
it's just the thumb it's just a thumb

850.98 --> 855.36
and if it has little headphones you

853.32 --> 856.9200000000001
immediately see Joe Rogan in it

855.36 --> 861.019
immediately

856.92 --> 861.019
I like in my head I just know

861.18 --> 865.8599999999999
right if you can find that that would be

863.16 --> 869.66
great but I basically lay down all the

865.86 --> 873.899
ideas that we came up with yesterday

869.66 --> 878.3
in Adam Meekins Skype

873.899 --> 878.3
says it's gonna be on it so we'll see

884.699 --> 889.139
hey dank

886.44 --> 892.0790000000001
it's you man and jado by the way yeah

889.139 --> 895.26
let me shout out everybody uh

892.079 --> 896.76
Terry 306

895.26 --> 899.959
check it out

896.76 --> 899.959
seeking star water

901.56 --> 905.9399999999999
for Rogan up what okay

907.8 --> 915.26
my well my the rogans on my show are

910.98 --> 915.26
still set to zero here visually

915.54 --> 918.3199999999999
I don't know why

922.62 --> 931.1
yeah so uh Rogan's up would be cool

927.06 --> 931.0999999999999
for those that are already in the Stream

931.5 --> 934.639
in the chat I mean

936.54 --> 941.42
ah there's two

939.12 --> 941.42
three

941.88 --> 947.8389999999999
all right that's better

944.94 --> 947.839
12 watching

952.079 --> 954.079
um

961.019 --> 966.24
right by the way it's been kind of

963.06 --> 967.079
interesting to me like sitting in that

966.24 --> 968.279
chat

967.079 --> 970.26
of the ham

968.279 --> 973.86
experience

970.26 --> 975.6
because like well it's all Dutch that's

973.86 --> 977.5790000000001
first off and

975.6 --> 979.74
and he interacts with the chat he even

977.579 --> 984.0
like

979.74 --> 986.699
yeah shouts me out and stuff pretty cool

984.0 --> 988.88
uh like when I say something to the

986.699 --> 988.88
point

990.54 --> 997.74
but it's interesting because well he has

993.899 --> 1001.16
like baller trolls too in his chat

997.74 --> 1004.6
and they don't just kick them out

1001.16 --> 1004.6
it's interesting

1008.42 --> 1012.92
it's

1009.62 --> 1015.32
yeah also because I'm kind of there I

1012.92 --> 1018.279
can study what's happening without being

1015.32 --> 1018.279
the freaking Target

1018.62 --> 1023.24
directly

1020.24 --> 1028.22
I mean I don't get like the full barrage

1023.24 --> 1030.679
of trolls like I do in some other places

1028.22 --> 1032.959
like the English spoken Flat Earth

1030.679 --> 1035.66
channels

1032.959 --> 1037.8390000000002
like for example when I go over at Dells

1035.66 --> 1037.8390000000002
or

1037.939 --> 1043.22
or flat swords or even gym Bobs you

1041.179 --> 1046.22
immediately start seeing my name and

1043.22 --> 1048.679
just whining

1046.22 --> 1050.54
and ridiculing me well that hasn't

1048.679 --> 1052.8200000000002
happened in the Dutch version yet even

1050.54 --> 1056.36
though there I know there are some

1052.82 --> 1058.96
really hey and are we in hating Dutch

1056.36 --> 1058.9599999999998
trolls too

1061.4 --> 1066.22
but maybe they don't go to that channel

1063.62 --> 1066.2199999999998
I don't know

1071.539 --> 1074.72
it's a nice picture of without

1072.919 --> 1076.46
intervention well I'm not didn't say I

1074.72 --> 1081.039
didn't intervene I mean I put myself

1076.46 --> 1081.039
down in the chat like I always do

1085.58 --> 1089.32
it's just kind of funny that

1089.96 --> 1094.0
they're like totally not used to it

1095.72 --> 1100.059
so I didn't get a lot of feedback

1097.7 --> 1102.919
because I put down like the concise

1100.059 --> 1104.72
formatted data and I translated to Dutch

1102.919 --> 1106.5200000000002
pretty eloquently although I've had some

1104.72 --> 1110.179
trouble even with translating certain

1106.52 --> 1114.62
words it's like presupposition

1110.179 --> 1117.5
and apparently in Dutch that is in a war

1114.62 --> 1118.58
understanding which is a pretty weird

1117.5 --> 1120.799
word

1118.58 --> 1123.1399999999999
like I've never actually in the common

1120.799 --> 1125.48
language use that ever

1123.14 --> 1127.76
so that's like

1125.48 --> 1131.08
that's gonna take some time to get used

1127.76 --> 1131.08
to applying that

1133.039 --> 1138.44
for understanding

1135.98 --> 1140.98
right because presupposition is a very

1138.44 --> 1142.8200000000002
important

1140.98 --> 1146.0
mechanism

1142.82 --> 1149.72
of argumentation

1146.0 --> 1153.32
that that is critical to understand like

1149.72 --> 1155.419
how Globe thinkers work in their

1153.32 --> 1159.08
reasoning

1155.419 --> 1161.24
and they they don't apply that word or

1159.08 --> 1163.6399999999999
they're just going about like yeah the

1161.24 --> 1166.64
ball is then just say this see so they

1163.64 --> 1168.5
don't have any argument or this guy and

1166.64 --> 1172.46
the people that didn't seem to have any

1168.5 --> 1175.7
like argumentation discipline

1172.46 --> 1178.82
so they they don't come from that kind

1175.7 --> 1182.799
of culture where they

1178.82 --> 1182.799
debate around the table

1182.9 --> 1187.52
and so they don't have like their

1184.94 --> 1190.22
refined skills concerning that but it is

1187.52 --> 1194.62
really important to make well

1190.22 --> 1194.6200000000001
to really win a debate in an argument

1197.0 --> 1203.32
hey

1199.22 --> 1203.32
I believe myself thanks and praise

1204.08 --> 1206.6789999999999
oh

1207.2 --> 1210.679
cool

1208.88 --> 1215.38
this is a Dutch Flat Earth has been

1210.679 --> 1215.38
following me since 2015. really

1222.679 --> 1228.52
huh

1225.2 --> 1228.52
have you said hello before

1230.14 --> 1234.1000000000001
I mean that's eight years

1235.34 --> 1238.1789999999999
hmm

1238.96 --> 1246.06
but yeah hello

1241.19 --> 1246.06
[Music]

1257.6 --> 1261.28
that's a little distracting

1267.08 --> 1270.62
I guess you're a bit shy

1268.67 --> 1273.22
[Music]

1270.62 --> 1273.2199999999998
foreign

1285.919 --> 1290.0
then you've seen a whole bunch of me

1288.74 --> 1292.88
then

1290.0 --> 1296.059
you probably got to see if you followed

1292.88 --> 1298.94
me for that long really like regularly

1296.059 --> 1301.3999999999999
or just sporadically I mean

1298.94 --> 1304.48
sorry for digging into that but if

1301.4 --> 1304.48
you've seen everything then

1305.78 --> 1311.36
the black cut the feel I hold you up no

1309.86 --> 1314.1999999999998
no no

1311.36 --> 1314.1999999999998
not at all

1316.88 --> 1322.159
just curious

1319.7 --> 1324.0800000000002
I mean it's quite a revelation like oh

1322.159 --> 1327.5
yes I've been following you all this

1324.08 --> 1329.6
time it's like whoa okay so then you got

1327.5 --> 1333.88
to see a whole bunch of me

1329.6 --> 1333.8799999999999
and my good sides and my bad sides

1340.76 --> 1345.26
because yeah well with people that

1343.039 --> 1348.44
typically follow in chat

1345.26 --> 1351.799
I know what they basically where roughly

1348.44 --> 1353.6000000000001
when they were there during all these

1351.799 --> 1356.24
phases

1353.6 --> 1359.1789999999999
roughly

1356.24 --> 1360.98
and I keep that in mind about that right

1359.179 --> 1363.799
but but I know because of interaction

1360.98 --> 1367.22
but with you it's like the first time

1363.799 --> 1369.44
and I'm like what okay so what

1367.22 --> 1372.02
how much do you actually know about me

1369.44 --> 1374.539
I'm basically putting you on the spot

1372.02 --> 1376.22
for a quiz and that's probably the

1374.539 --> 1378.58
reason why you never spoke up before

1376.22 --> 1381.799
because she knew I'd do that

1378.58 --> 1384.6399999999999
you don't have to answer

1381.799 --> 1384.6399999999999
ah

1391.58 --> 1397.539
but

1393.679 --> 1397.539
this is the best phase so far

1398.48 --> 1403.3600000000001
hmm

1400.64 --> 1403.3600000000001
I don't know

1403.7 --> 1411.26
personally I do feel like from a

1408.14 --> 1414.14
selfish point of view yeah I feel better

1411.26 --> 1415.58
I'm in a better place overall I'm more

1414.14 --> 1417.74
stable

1415.58 --> 1420.52
I'm more developed

1417.74 --> 1420.52
a more

1421.7 --> 1426.7
yeah

1423.86 --> 1426.6999999999998
I'm better

1428.72 --> 1434.2
but it's like all the other parts

1434.539 --> 1438.34
it's important that that happen

1440.059 --> 1445.039
well important well it's important to me

1442.4 --> 1446.6000000000001
but because I was so public about it

1445.039 --> 1449.419
basically working it out in the open

1446.6 --> 1453.98
it's really you can see how much of a

1449.419 --> 1456.74
difference right and in a way I hope

1453.98 --> 1461.179
that just by showing all of this

1456.74 --> 1464.659
development over the years even the that

1461.179 --> 1466.8200000000002
sometimes when you bump into people that

1464.659 --> 1469.22
well might be like I was in the start

1466.82 --> 1473.1399999999999
like really like kind of sickly almost

1469.22 --> 1473.14
from stress and [ __ ] and

1473.419 --> 1479.3600000000001
maybe paranoid really badly

1477.5 --> 1481.58
that

1479.36 --> 1483.1399999999999
they're not just trash

1481.58 --> 1487.1
or per default

1483.14 --> 1488.9
because if they like have a mission if

1487.1 --> 1492.02
they're like working at it

1488.9 --> 1496.0
well there's a whole bunch of good

1492.02 --> 1496.0
development that can grow out of that

1497.32 --> 1503.059
right I might not certainly be the

1500.5 --> 1504.74
almighty financial success and all that

1503.059 --> 1506.48
but that's like personal I'm not even

1504.74 --> 1508.4
tying that into

1506.48 --> 1513.159
my development

1508.4 --> 1513.159
it's just like stability and

1513.5 --> 1520.22
dealing with social

1517.24 --> 1523.659
interaction-based issues

1520.22 --> 1523.659
like anger control

1523.76 --> 1528.86
fear

1525.08 --> 1531.1999999999998
don't like perversions like

1528.86 --> 1534.26
roll that back because at the start I

1531.2 --> 1536.96
was also kind of like

1534.26 --> 1539.62
either super rough mouth like out of

1536.96 --> 1542.72
control rough mouth or

1539.62 --> 1545.4799999999998
really timid

1542.72 --> 1548.84
and now

1545.48 --> 1551.0
it's like both sides much more over this

1548.84 --> 1553.52
is over a year so now it's like it more

1551.0 --> 1556.4
connected into one thing that is a much

1553.52 --> 1560.86
more controllable spectrum of expression

1556.4 --> 1560.8600000000001
instead of just these two extremities

1560.96 --> 1567.6200000000001
I've managed to develop that but how did

1563.779 --> 1570.08
I do that by exposure by by showing it

1567.62 --> 1572.0
by like it's there it's not a secret I

1570.08 --> 1573.799
can't keep it My Little Secret in that

1572.0 --> 1575.14
in the background pretending like it

1573.799 --> 1578.6589999999999
doesn't exist

1575.14 --> 1581.179
in the public awareness right force it

1578.659 --> 1585.679
out in the open and thereby confronting

1581.179 --> 1588.98
it and then you have to work on it

1585.679 --> 1591.5590000000002
or you're just going to be show looking

1588.98 --> 1594.44
weak and humiliated on the long run like

1591.559 --> 1599.08
once you expose a weakness you have to

1594.44 --> 1599.0800000000002
work on it if you do that publicly

1603.2 --> 1608.299
or even at all to people

1606.44 --> 1611.1200000000001
but that's the problem right it's like a

1608.299 --> 1613.76
lot of people they have this

1611.12 --> 1616.6399999999999
this idea like there should they should

1613.76 --> 1618.2
be like they only want a perfect image

1616.64 --> 1621.44
to the outside world because they want

1618.2 --> 1624.38
like that social kind of power

1621.44 --> 1626.1200000000001
to dominate others

1624.38 --> 1627.44
that don't feel as secure about

1626.12 --> 1630.7399999999998
themselves

1627.44 --> 1634.7
and then you just make a a social image

1630.74 --> 1637.039
of yourself it's not honest at all

1634.7 --> 1640.4
and some people in the Netherlands that

1637.039 --> 1641.96
what most people that I dealt with in

1640.4 --> 1643.3400000000001
the Netherland were of course announced

1641.96 --> 1645.5
since I live here

1643.34 --> 1648.74
I've met quite a few people that are

1645.5 --> 1650.059
like really in that image and it's just

1648.74 --> 1652.76
like

1650.059 --> 1654.62
this giant energy mask that they're

1652.76 --> 1657.32
constantly wearing and I'm just so

1654.62 --> 1659.539
seeing it it's like really catching my

1657.32 --> 1661.1
eye that they're doing that and then I

1659.539 --> 1663.32
get curious to like who are they

1661.1 --> 1666.82
actually secretly inside and that's very

1663.32 --> 1666.82
dangerous to inquire that

1668.72 --> 1676.039
laughs

1671.539 --> 1681.1589999999999
but I am so not that I am not I don't

1676.039 --> 1681.1589999999999
have an image my image is me

1681.5 --> 1685.96
I use myself as my image

1686.36 --> 1692.1789999999999
and my image when I work on it that

1689.72 --> 1695.559
means I work on myself

1692.179 --> 1699.0800000000002
and not just on some pretentious

1695.559 --> 1701.5
wannabe icon of who I want people to see

1699.08 --> 1701.5
me as

1708.98 --> 1711.58
anyway

1717.22 --> 1723.039
literally from a desk in an attic like

1720.679 --> 1723.039
room

1724.7 --> 1730.3600000000001
top for

1726.86 --> 1730.36
the frame and

1735.2 --> 1741.3400000000001
well this is not an attic

1737.5 --> 1741.34
this is a flat apartment

1741.88 --> 1747.14
and I happen to be at well at literally

1745.7 --> 1750.82
a corner

1747.14 --> 1750.8200000000002
spot at the top

1752.6 --> 1757.58
but it is part of a bigger house but

1754.7 --> 1760.48
this is just my room

1757.58 --> 1765.5
and yeah that's the entire

1760.48 --> 1768.08
Arwin channel has been here

1765.5 --> 1770.179
filmed from here kind of monotonous I

1768.08 --> 1772.36
guess but this is what it is this is the

1770.179 --> 1772.3600000000001
place

1776.899 --> 1783.1
did I get you no tarot I I've been too

1780.5 --> 1783.1
busy talking

1785.62 --> 1789.399
oh I'll get to it

1794.48 --> 1800.08
going argument after argument waiting

1797.059 --> 1800.08
all the time right yeah

1803.84 --> 1808.36
I'm very good at that I have become a

1806.6 --> 1812.36
lot more like I'm

1808.36 --> 1816.4399999999998
when I go debated baller I'm like I'm

1812.36 --> 1818.779
really sorry I'm really sorry but you've

1816.44 --> 1821.96
overlooked this little detail and it's

1818.779 --> 1825.559
just not unfortunately I want it to be

1821.96 --> 1826.76
real too like that's how I talk now more

1825.559 --> 1828.6789999999999
much more in that there I'm over

1826.76 --> 1831.74
exaggerating a little

1828.679 --> 1834.6200000000001
but yeah that's how it was with the the

1831.74 --> 1836.96
other day with says Moretz

1834.62 --> 1839.36
and that is really how I do it because I

1836.96 --> 1842.059
actually I I don't see Ballers as

1839.36 --> 1845.1789999999999
enemies like I am

1842.059 --> 1849.1589999999999
a baller like that

1845.179 --> 1849.159
I just know it's not real

1852.679 --> 1857.8400000000001
it's just that

1854.48 --> 1860.6
it not being real never really actually

1857.84 --> 1861.9189999999999
destroyed my love for it

1860.6 --> 1865.279
it just

1861.919 --> 1867.22
took another form and now it's like it's

1865.279 --> 1870.76
this

1867.22 --> 1870.76
cultural dream

1871.1 --> 1875.36
and there's there is a certain

1873.2 --> 1877.7
mechanical logic behind it even though

1875.36 --> 1880.52
it is

1877.7 --> 1882.44
utterly flawed but that is like part of

1880.52 --> 1887.059
the magic of it

1882.44 --> 1889.22
it's a dream and there's logic to it a

1887.059 --> 1891.2
dream logic and you build it we all

1889.22 --> 1893.24
build it together

1891.2 --> 1895.88
and we have everybody has their own idea

1893.24 --> 1900.22
and then yeah the powers that be then

1895.88 --> 1900.22
basically give a stupid swing to it

1900.5 --> 1904.94
right but in the meantime all these

1902.72 --> 1907.1000000000001
people they believe in it they think

1904.94 --> 1909.159
about it and they have their ideas and

1907.1 --> 1912.08
sometimes like science fiction

1909.159 --> 1915.74
comes rolling out of that

1912.08 --> 1918.32
which is be really interesting

1915.74 --> 1922.22
and so that's kind of how I see it

1918.32 --> 1924.62
but in this age where we're being

1922.22 --> 1929.3600000000001
mind controlled and liked to on a vast

1924.62 --> 1931.52
scale to our obvious detriment it's very

1929.36 --> 1936.02
important that people

1931.52 --> 1939.32
besides enjoying dreams know what is

1936.02 --> 1942.26
real and what isn't it's critical for

1939.32 --> 1944.6
our survival in this coming period

1942.26 --> 1946.58
so critical

1944.6 --> 1951.6789999999999
because there's going to be massive

1946.58 --> 1951.6789999999999
Bluffs like massive scares threats

1952.159 --> 1958.3990000000001
and it's like that's happened before but

1954.38 --> 1962.419
now it's gonna be more in your face and

1958.399 --> 1964.039
before you know it Hysteria

1962.419 --> 1966.679
and then

1964.039 --> 1969.799
like yeah

1966.679 --> 1973.64
certain governments might basically go

1969.799 --> 1977.44
all like actually militant on us

1973.64 --> 1977.44
like there is that possibility

1980.36 --> 1985.6999999999998
so it's extremely important that we

1983.48 --> 1987.8600000000001
everybody whatever they're doing in

1985.7 --> 1989.3600000000001
whatever field that they know what is

1987.86 --> 1991.8799999999999
real and what isn't

1989.36 --> 1994.519
and everybody in every other field will

1991.88 --> 1996.5590000000002
be dependent on everybody else in their

1994.519 --> 1999.279
specialist field knowing what is real

1996.559 --> 1999.279
and what isn't

1999.32 --> 2004.059
and Corruption will be extremely

2001.779 --> 2007.72
detrimental

2004.059 --> 2009.7
and probably get you like unimaginable

2007.72 --> 2014.34
vengeance

2009.7 --> 2014.3400000000001
onto your shoulders for doing that

2014.76 --> 2019.96
unimaginable at this point I mean that's

2017.62 --> 2022.0
gonna be

2019.96 --> 2025.019
really

2022.0 --> 2028.779
really bad for you

2025.019 --> 2030.76
right but so know what is real and what

2028.779 --> 2033.299
isn't

2030.76 --> 2033.299
anyway

2041.44 --> 2044.38
it's a different debating style from

2043.24 --> 2047.38
Nathan

2044.38 --> 2049.599
right well it's still the way that I

2047.38 --> 2053.7400000000002
debate is still from a perspective of

2049.599 --> 2056.02
winning because it is it's one this is

2053.74 --> 2058.54
just the aftermath right there's no

2056.02 --> 2061.379
contention to me there isn't there

2058.54 --> 2064.359
really isn't every argument can be

2061.379 --> 2067.0
rebuttaled in detail every argument it's

2064.359 --> 2069.46
just that the energies Run High then

2067.0 --> 2071.919
eventually I might get impatient or

2069.46 --> 2073.48
fatigued it's like I might lose my

2071.919 --> 2077.0989999999997
concentration or my patience because

2073.48 --> 2077.099
it's just like getting too annoying

2077.8 --> 2083.26
but as long as that energy buildup

2081.399 --> 2085.7799999999997
doesn't happen because the other party

2083.26 --> 2088.599
is really aware of it like status Moretz

2085.78 --> 2091.5
is really in control socially of himself

2088.599 --> 2091.5
very impressive

2091.899 --> 2097.2
well then I don't then I can be very

2094.659 --> 2097.2000000000003
focused

2099.339 --> 2104.7999999999997
and then I don't get have like

2102.119 --> 2107.6800000000003
patronizing attitude seeping in right

2104.8 --> 2111.6400000000003
because that's an energy response

2107.68 --> 2113.56
I can do the same things but without the

2111.64 --> 2116.7999999999997
load

2113.56 --> 2118.66
if there's nothing on from the other

2116.8 --> 2121.38
side

2118.66 --> 2121.3799999999997
to match

2128.32 --> 2132.2200000000003
and of course it works

2130.31 --> 2134.619
[Music]

2132.22 --> 2136.4199999999996
because if you can just convey the truth

2134.619 --> 2139.54
from a very

2136.42 --> 2141.16
confident position very calmly

2139.54 --> 2143.74
and with

2141.16 --> 2146.02
sympathy

2143.74 --> 2148.4199999999996
like knowing like yeah you are mistaken

2146.02 --> 2149.7
and not being like oh oh you think

2148.42 --> 2152.32
you're right

2149.7 --> 2155.64
you're so wrong oh you're a loser

2152.32 --> 2159.099
because you believe in the ball no no no

2155.64 --> 2162.5789999999997
exactly the Opposites like I'm sorry man

2159.099 --> 2166.92
I really wish it was that ball too but

2162.579 --> 2166.92
it just isn't I'm sorry man

2167.38 --> 2173.1600000000003
that's a much more reasonable way to to

2170.5 --> 2173.16
deal with it

2177.4 --> 2182.7400000000002
come on

2178.66 --> 2185.74
that way it might they might have feel

2182.74 --> 2185.74
like

2185.92 --> 2190.119
strong enough to actually try to

2188.619 --> 2192.46
understand it a bit

2190.119 --> 2195.339
to actually open that door not just let

2192.46 --> 2197.7400000000002
it be oh that's Flat Earth rhetoric but

2195.339 --> 2200.14
actually listening

2197.74 --> 2203.6189999999997
to what it is and and

2200.14 --> 2207.1189999999997
accepting it to figure it out

2203.619 --> 2210.04
because that second step well

2207.119 --> 2212.619
anti-flat earthers never make that seven

2210.04 --> 2215.22
second step never

2212.619 --> 2217.48
they can't

2215.22 --> 2220.359
that's how you know

2217.48 --> 2224.2
they can repeat it verbatim but they

2220.359 --> 2226.119
cannot understand it you see they just

2224.2 --> 2227.74
copy paste it it's just like a

2226.119 --> 2229.839
hieroglyph to them it's like oh that's

2227.74 --> 2231.7599999999998
that flatter thing they say exactly like

2229.839 --> 2234.22
that and then they might even be able to

2231.76 --> 2236.099
repeat that but they're not actually

2234.22 --> 2239.9399999999996
going to

2236.099 --> 2239.94
cognitively approach it

2241.06 --> 2246.54
there they're locked out from doing that

2250.06 --> 2256.0
um

2251.7 --> 2259.06
you still frequent in Bob show well I do

2256.0 --> 2261.04
hang out in a chat and all that Dr Bass

2259.06 --> 2262.2999999999997
awkward

2261.04 --> 2264.88
but

2262.3 --> 2267.88
I mean I don't go on the panel that

2264.88 --> 2270.7200000000003
often I've been on there like three or

2267.88 --> 2270.7200000000003
four times now

2273.22 --> 2277.68
but I'm sure I'll get back there I mean

2277.72 --> 2281.64
I feel like poking him a bit

2282.46 --> 2287.68
I mean he pokes people all the time and

2284.98 --> 2290.079
I think he should get some on the level

2287.68 --> 2291.7
poking back

2290.079 --> 2296.2000000000003
Maybe

2291.7 --> 2299.74
start getting into his yeah his

2296.2 --> 2302.04
way of the use of the word arbitrary for

2299.74 --> 2302.04
example

2302.38 --> 2306.1600000000003
which I think

2304.18 --> 2307.7799999999997
and this is of course a joke I think

2306.16 --> 2312.5789999999997
that his application of the word

2307.78 --> 2315.3590000000004
arbitrary seems to be a little arbitrary

2312.579 --> 2315.3590000000004
Jim Bob

2326.74 --> 2331.5989999999997
right the gym Bob is with a little bit

2329.26 --> 2334.6200000000003
of a troll it seems

2331.599 --> 2337.81
it's just he likes doing that

2334.62 --> 2337.81
[Music]

2341.26 --> 2348.2400000000002
there's gonna be people that are gonna

2343.48 --> 2348.2400000000002
match that move on that level

2349.96 --> 2354.46
and I happen to really be kind of sharp

2353.2 --> 2356.98
and

2354.46 --> 2360.839
um well on the the meaning and

2356.98 --> 2360.839
application of words you see

2362.38 --> 2367.96
I like to identify sloppiness and

2365.5 --> 2369.579
technobabble

2367.96 --> 2371.68
right

2369.579 --> 2374.3390000000004
and that's gives them quite some

2371.68 --> 2374.339
response

2382.0 --> 2390.339
of course you have obvious techno Babble

2385.3 --> 2393.46
like in Star Trek or whatever right

2390.339 --> 2395.92
but you also have just things that you

2393.46 --> 2398.98
claim make sense

2395.92 --> 2400.839
when when you decipher it like you put

2398.98 --> 2402.64
it under the loop you take element you

2400.839 --> 2404.56
take the elements apart and then just

2402.64 --> 2408.96
really figure out what it means

2404.56 --> 2408.96
and then there's no logic to it really

2409.42 --> 2414.359
or it becomes like hyper ethereal

2414.64 --> 2418.44
yeah you know

2418.48 --> 2425.22
that's then I lost my train of thought

2422.859 --> 2425.22
yeah

2425.619 --> 2430.48
a meaning of words and I think that Jim

2427.96 --> 2433.26
Bob uses the word arbitrary a little bit

2430.48 --> 2433.26
too much

2437.32 --> 2444.339
and I think that in his well his

2441.66 --> 2446.14
expert ground that he is threading now

2444.339 --> 2448.2
he's getting really he's really trying

2446.14 --> 2450.7
to be like higher philosopher

2448.2 --> 2452.3799999999997
philosophical but I think that he's

2450.7 --> 2456.22
getting a little bit too comfortable

2452.38 --> 2460.32
with that and he hasn't really had

2456.22 --> 2460.3199999999997
very serious high level opposition

2460.96 --> 2464.2
like

2462.04 --> 2466.42
from

2464.2 --> 2468.66
basically people that are more on his

2466.42 --> 2468.66
side

2471.7 --> 2478.4199999999996
it gets people like from naturalists and

2475.42 --> 2478.42
uh

2479.579 --> 2483.46
Gematria and what is the gnostics all

2482.26 --> 2485.26
that

2483.46 --> 2487.3
those people that they have their own

2485.26 --> 2489.88
channel and therefore that and they're

2487.3 --> 2492.52
following yeah he goes after that easily

2489.88 --> 2494.859
because those people are really deluded

2492.52 --> 2496.06
they really don't understand like what

2494.859 --> 2499.7999999999997
they're doing

2496.06 --> 2499.7999999999997
and he's good at that

2500.5 --> 2508.079
but how about your own world view gym up

2505.48 --> 2508.079
foreign

2510.46 --> 2513.3
sometimes

2517.66 --> 2523.7799999999997
Imaging mental masturbation and waste of

2520.0 --> 2526.42
time well lumpy gas in a vacuum gross

2523.78 --> 2528.46
but

2526.42 --> 2530.079
yeah a little

2528.46 --> 2533.8
well to me

2530.079 --> 2536.38
like traditional philosophizing

2533.8 --> 2538.78
is kind of that

2536.38 --> 2542.2200000000003
I think that it is actually kind of a

2538.78 --> 2542.2200000000003
waste of time because it's

2542.619 --> 2547.7200000000003
it's to me it's like you're playing with

2545.56 --> 2551.32
Legos when you could literally be

2547.72 --> 2554.4399999999996
machine engineering it in your

2551.32 --> 2556.48
in your garage on a high level you could

2554.44 --> 2559.619
actually make something right that's

2556.48 --> 2559.619
what it is to be

2565.18 --> 2571.1189999999997
and it's

2567.54 --> 2574.5
it is kind of mathematical in its nature

2571.119 --> 2574.5
and I don't like that

2575.56 --> 2580.839
that's why even like when I was on with

2578.26 --> 2583.599
Jim Bob I said like

2580.839 --> 2585.52
this is like philosophical mathematics

2583.599 --> 2587.92
that's what you're doing

2585.52 --> 2591.7
and I just don't get that

2587.92 --> 2594.579
like that oversimplifies like really

2591.7 --> 2598.2999999999997
elaborate Concepts that really shouldn't

2594.579 --> 2600.7000000000003
be oversimplified like that at all in

2598.3 --> 2602.1400000000003
just an on-the-fly argument

2600.7 --> 2604.5989999999997
you see

2602.14 --> 2607.359
and Jim Bob does do that

2604.599 --> 2608.8
he's kind of a philosophy hipster like

2607.359 --> 2610.42
that a bit

2608.8 --> 2614.04
right Jim Bob

2610.42 --> 2614.04
he'd probably agreed to that

2614.319 --> 2618.579
but hey it's entertaining it's

2616.42 --> 2621.88
interesting and

2618.579 --> 2624.76
he has really funny voices and

2621.88 --> 2627.2400000000002
videos so I'm not complaining I like

2624.76 --> 2627.2400000000002
Jimbo

2627.76 --> 2635.26
but I will analyze him honestly

2631.9 --> 2637.6600000000003
and hey if he cares then he might get

2635.26 --> 2640.1400000000003
something constructing a constructive

2637.66 --> 2640.14
out of it

2641.32 --> 2644.53
[Music]

2649.98 --> 2655.54
he loses me philosophical Christian

2653.14 --> 2658.0
Orthodox Babel

2655.54 --> 2659.92
well I do think some of it is

2658.0 --> 2660.65
interesting

2659.92 --> 2663.909
but

2660.65 --> 2663.909
[Music]

2665.02 --> 2670.06
I wonder if he actually really realizes

2667.78 --> 2672.28
what he's doing with that

2670.06 --> 2674.619
because sometimes I feel like like

2672.28 --> 2677.02
you're just doing this because you're

2674.619 --> 2679.599
into it right now right Jim Bob I mean

2677.02 --> 2683.68
you're not actually

2679.599 --> 2685.2400000000002
fully transitioning into Eastern

2683.68 --> 2688.48
Orthodoxy

2685.24 --> 2691.4399999999996
because a person with his skills I mean

2688.48 --> 2691.44
that seems just

2692.26 --> 2696.2400000000002
bizarre to me

2697.3 --> 2706.98
who is Jim Knox what

2702.16 --> 2706.98
made by Jim Bob Tara 306

2707.8 --> 2714.1600000000003
is in my favorite list

2710.38 --> 2717.46
he has streams almost every day

2714.16 --> 2721.02
and they're they are really funny

2717.46 --> 2721.02
his types are really funny

2721.839 --> 2726.2799999999997
and he does like these deep fake face

2723.819 --> 2729.54
overs

2726.28 --> 2729.5400000000004
when he does the voices

2746.44 --> 2751.54
all right and by the way that the Posh

2748.78 --> 2753.1600000000003
guy that is like his steady sidekick

2751.54 --> 2754.42
almost at this point

2753.16 --> 2757.8999999999996
foreign

2754.42 --> 2761.04
I mean he is a really cool guy

2757.9 --> 2761.04
in the sense that

2762.819 --> 2766.96
for a person that's actually like

2764.859 --> 2768.52
scholarly

2766.96 --> 2771.88
Priestly

2768.52 --> 2774.52
like he would be the guy to ask because

2771.88 --> 2776.38
he is like a really one of the good guys

2774.52 --> 2778.0
like that

2776.38 --> 2782.319
and he's just

2778.0 --> 2783.9
like this really old old block way of

2782.319 --> 2787.9
just

2783.9 --> 2789.76
explaining things very meticulously

2787.9 --> 2792.9
a lot of references

2789.76 --> 2792.9
it is interesting

2793.119 --> 2797.92
what he has to say and he has a lot of

2795.16 --> 2799.72
like feedback on just detailed things

2797.92 --> 2803.38
that have happened

2799.72 --> 2806.0789999999997
in Priestly argumentations I probably

2803.38 --> 2808.54
studied like a whole bunch of books and

2806.079 --> 2811.0600000000004
letters and all that from

2808.54 --> 2812.74
priests in the Eastern Orthodoxy I think

2811.06 --> 2815.56
that's part of by the way of even

2812.74 --> 2817.06
becoming a priest there so but it's it's

2815.56 --> 2820.18
just interesting he's an interesting guy

2817.06 --> 2822.04
and he is really nice

2820.18 --> 2825.8799999999997
like you can't even be a little bit

2822.04 --> 2828.04
critical a bit Pokey with him and he has

2825.88 --> 2830.619
feelings

2828.04 --> 2833.94
but he is just his attitude is so good

2830.619 --> 2836.38
and I really admire that in a man

2833.94 --> 2839.52
I mean that's kind of how I want to be

2836.38 --> 2839.52
too in that sense

2841.06 --> 2846.7
but the attitude part anyway

2843.94 --> 2849.88
so yeah he is a really cool guy but I'm

2846.7 --> 2852.7
just not that super interested

2849.88 --> 2853.6600000000003
I'm interested in figuring out this

2852.7 --> 2855.04
religion

2853.66 --> 2857.56
sure

2855.04 --> 2861.599
but I do not think that it is the

2857.56 --> 2861.599
Salvation absolutely not

2861.76 --> 2866.98
I don't think there's any organized

2864.46 --> 2868.359
religions that will actually help my

2866.98 --> 2870.4
salvation

2868.359 --> 2873.72
out there

2870.4 --> 2873.7200000000003
I have to do it on my own

2880.42 --> 2885.339
but yeah there's a whole bunch of wisdom

2883.599 --> 2887.7400000000002
from people that

2885.339 --> 2889.48
is valuable

2887.74 --> 2891.819
so I'm not saying like oh the other

2889.48 --> 2893.98
religion they should all be destroyed no

2891.819 --> 2895.72
absolutely not

2893.98 --> 2900.48
they all serve a purpose they all have

2895.72 --> 2900.48
grown out of a spirit of those people

2902.92 --> 2908.6800000000003
but things should be better understood

2906.94 --> 2911.26
and approached a little bit more

2908.68 --> 2915.16
critically without then

2911.26 --> 2917.5600000000004
like radically changing things even but

2915.16 --> 2919.2999999999997
just the understanding about it the way

2917.56 --> 2921.94
they

2919.3 --> 2925.54
perceive things and historically reflect

2921.94 --> 2928.66
and I I think that like what if

2925.54 --> 2930.819
this is probably never gonna happen

2928.66 --> 2932.92
but maybe it would

2930.819 --> 2934.48
what if Christianity could be really

2932.92 --> 2938.46
transformed

2934.48 --> 2938.46
like back into the original version

2939.819 --> 2941.819
um

2942.88 --> 2946.1400000000003
yeah it's not gonna work

2948.46 --> 2952.14
because it is kind of like a

2953.38 --> 2955.8
yeah

2955.96 --> 2960.099
the way it works it it really is there

2958.18 --> 2962.7999999999997
organized religion two and two have

2960.099 --> 2965.079
people indulge and still think that

2962.8 --> 2967.48
they're doing the right thing and that

2965.079 --> 2968.6800000000003
is kind of the thing that also makes it

2967.48 --> 2971.4
big

2968.68 --> 2971.3999999999996
ger

2974.2 --> 2980.859
the whole point about yeah what I think

2977.8 --> 2983.5600000000004
the path of Christ is what he actually

2980.859 --> 2985.48
his actual teachings not everything else

2983.56 --> 2988.5
talked about

2985.48 --> 2988.5
by other people

2988.96 --> 2994.5
that it is really all about just doing

2991.96 --> 2994.5
it yourself

2996.819 --> 3001.14
it's all about upholding your own

2998.98 --> 3003.839
standard

3001.14 --> 3006.9
and by doing that you said in an example

3003.839 --> 3010.44
and then other people will long to be

3006.9 --> 3012.839
like that too and they will work at it

3010.44 --> 3015.42
by showing that it exists you give them

3012.839 --> 3018.0
an opportunity to work at it

3015.42 --> 3022.88
and that is really the Christ Way

3018.0 --> 3022.88
and it's not about groups and Power

3023.46 --> 3028.8
although of course yeah if you have

3025.92 --> 3030.9
vessels in the Earthly realm you do want

3028.8 --> 3032.76
to Survive and Thrive and so there is

3030.9 --> 3035.339
always going to be some power involved

3032.76 --> 3037.6800000000003
somewhere but it shouldn't

3035.339 --> 3040.859
be centralized on

3037.68 --> 3043.64
a church Community like that

3040.859 --> 3043.64
I think

3044.46 --> 3050.639
no yeah anyway

3047.54 --> 3050.639
[Music]

3059.819 --> 3065.94
look at this queen yeah Dr Bass Acworth

3063.42 --> 3069.2000000000003
yeah I remember that that was hilarious

3065.94 --> 3069.2000000000003
look at the screen

3069.66 --> 3073.7599999999998
hey skeptic936 good to see you

3077.099 --> 3080.099
foreign

3082.74 --> 3087.24
chirping out there it's

3084.78 --> 3090.2400000000002
a lot of it

3087.24 --> 3090.24
here

3094.5 --> 3099.92
I guess I wasn't the only one feeling

3096.599 --> 3099.92
the spring in the air

3106.44 --> 3109.94
is the mic picking it up

3111.059 --> 3114.02
not a lot

3115.26 --> 3120.2000000000003
I could

3117.24 --> 3120.2
try to

3120.72 --> 3126.7799999999997
get the mic

3123.54 --> 3128.94
more at the door but I'd risk like

3126.78 --> 3131.46
losing sound

3128.94 --> 3135.44
anyway

3131.46 --> 3135.44
birds chirping all over the place

3141.9 --> 3144.9
foreign

3152.48 --> 3158.18
lose break all trust in government

3155.7 --> 3158.18
well

3159.48 --> 3163.04
but is that a good thing though

3167.22 --> 3173.339
I mean

3168.839 --> 3176.22
lose trust in this group of people in

3173.339 --> 3178.14
the government in power

3176.22 --> 3180.5989999999997
that would be good

3178.14 --> 3184.2599999999998
but government

3180.599 --> 3186.54
is kind of essential

3184.26 --> 3189.5
at this stage especially in the

3186.54 --> 3189.5
Netherlands I mean

3189.66 --> 3195.96
it's too hectic

3193.74 --> 3198.359
to not have any government at all but

3195.96 --> 3199.559
they should not be these people in the

3198.359 --> 3200.7
government

3199.559 --> 3203.1600000000003
right

3200.7 --> 3205.02
and besides if you have a good

3203.16 --> 3206.64
government and they uphold the globe

3205.02 --> 3209.94
narrative

3206.64 --> 3211.6189999999997
as a standard but not shove it in your

3209.94 --> 3213.48
face all the time what's bad about that

3211.619 --> 3214.8
right I mean it's just like yeah it's

3213.48 --> 3216.839
just

3214.8 --> 3219.54
so you can still connect up with

3216.839 --> 3223.44
everything out there

3219.54 --> 3225.72
it's not the stance of government going

3223.44 --> 3227.3
with the globe narrative the problem is

3225.72 --> 3230.0989999999997
is when they

3227.3 --> 3232.92
aggressively push mind control things

3230.099 --> 3236.76
concerning that on people or start to

3232.92 --> 3239.099
punish people for not believing that

3236.76 --> 3241.079
right that some kind of teachers

3239.099 --> 3242.579
directive against Flat Earth like those

3241.079 --> 3245.54
things are

3242.579 --> 3245.54
unwanted

3246.599 --> 3251.2200000000003
but yeah

3249.0 --> 3253.319
it's the people in government not

3251.22 --> 3257.16
government itself government is really

3253.319 --> 3259.02
useful and you need it things will go to

3257.16 --> 3260.819
absolute [ __ ] if you don't have

3259.02 --> 3262.92
government

3260.819 --> 3264.54
there's too many people in the

3262.92 --> 3267.119
Netherlands that if there wasn't any

3264.54 --> 3269.46
government they'd literally

3267.119 --> 3271.559
just turn into Warlords and start

3269.46 --> 3274.16
looting and raping

3271.559 --> 3274.1600000000003
okay

3281.52 --> 3285.8
as the rejection of a One World

3283.44 --> 3285.8
Government

3290.579 --> 3293.0
well

3293.4 --> 3301.8
look it's not yeah well it's complicated

3298.38 --> 3304.319
I mean if the One World Government is

3301.8 --> 3307.5
going to mean that just a few people

3304.319 --> 3313.14
that elect themselves and each other

3307.5 --> 3316.38
have massive power over resources and

3313.14 --> 3320.0989999999997
transport and all kinds of things of

3316.38 --> 3322.8
countries yeah that's a bad thing

3320.099 --> 3325.98
but to have a one world government where

3322.8 --> 3328.02
everybody's just a nation and try to

3325.98 --> 3329.16
work this thing out I mean that's not

3328.02 --> 3332.7599999999998
bad

3329.16 --> 3336.839
as a format it's just that if such a

3332.76 --> 3339.78
format then a forum right format a forum

3336.839 --> 3341.7599999999998
if it's going to be used to conspire

3339.78 --> 3344.2200000000003
against the people altogether yeah then

3341.76 --> 3349.3390000000004
it is so it's about the action it's

3344.22 --> 3349.339
about the actions not about the format

3350.04 --> 3355.46
so if a forum like for uh what is it a

3355.5 --> 3359.4
uh

3356.7 --> 3363.1189999999997
like the world economic forum

3359.4 --> 3366.0
if it turns out that it is primarily

3363.119 --> 3368.94
about just well

3366.0 --> 3371.7
making them eat the bugs and

3368.94 --> 3374.16
no longer all that [ __ ] right you know

3371.7 --> 3375.8999999999996
the whole process I mean it's a it's a

3374.16 --> 3378.02
long list of terrible things that

3375.9 --> 3382.079
they're trying to implement everywhere

3378.02 --> 3387.78
destroying farming food

3382.079 --> 3390.42
climate change nonsense policies etc etc

3387.78 --> 3393.059
or if it's just that yeah then it should

3390.42 --> 3395.46
absolutely be shut down but if that just

3393.059 --> 3398.4
was a little part of it and they don't

3395.46 --> 3401.64
really get a lot of traction

3398.4 --> 3402.48
then why close down a forum like that

3401.64 --> 3404.5789999999997
right

3402.48 --> 3407.52
so it's about

3404.579 --> 3409.8
what is happening with it not what it is

3407.52 --> 3411.72
government is not the problem it's the

3409.8 --> 3414.8390000000004
people in the government that are the

3411.72 --> 3417.8999999999996
problem and that's how you should see it

3414.839 --> 3422.119
yeah the the terrible things unrolling

3417.9 --> 3422.119
are happening because of individuals

3422.4 --> 3427.559
and what they've been doing

3425.16 --> 3429.72
with the government the rules that

3427.559 --> 3433.8
they've been

3429.72 --> 3438.14
putting in there that shouldn't be there

3433.8 --> 3438.1400000000003
because without them it would work great

3439.38 --> 3443.9
and it's necessary to have a government

3445.26 --> 3450.2400000000002
I mean take away government and then the

3448.079 --> 3454.28
real genocide actually starts all

3450.24 --> 3454.2799999999997
naturally you don't want that

3460.559 --> 3465.26
you just want the [ __ ] up people out

3462.839 --> 3465.2599999999998
of the government

3466.44 --> 3469.7000000000003
so how are you gonna do that

3474.359 --> 3477.5
you gotta figure it out

3486.059 --> 3488.599
right

3489.96 --> 3495.0
and I wonder like if if there should in

3493.619 --> 3496.859
the Netherlands for example there's

3495.0 --> 3500.46
these people in the government now are

3496.859 --> 3501.5989999999997
so bad they're so terrifyingly bad at

3500.46 --> 3503.52
this point

3501.599 --> 3506.52
record

3503.52 --> 3506.52
bad

3508.8 --> 3513.6600000000003
there should literally be just a count

3511.44 --> 3515.7000000000003
of public counsel and like how do we get

3513.66 --> 3518.52
these people out

3515.7 --> 3521.819
because they're not leaving

3518.52 --> 3523.799
so how do we get them out and I think

3521.819 --> 3526.02
there's even like lawsuits and [ __ ]

3523.799 --> 3528.42
happening the problem is is like it when

3526.02 --> 3531.66
that even succeeds is that gonna get

3528.42 --> 3534.0
them out like what's gonna what what is

3531.66 --> 3536.64
necessary for that step for them to

3534.0 --> 3539.579
actually get out right not just oh we're

3536.64 --> 3542.22
working on it but like what will it take

3539.579 --> 3544.1400000000003
to act like will that work

3542.22 --> 3547.319
or are they suddenly going to bring some

3544.14 --> 3550.6189999999997
mercenary Army Out of the Shadows to

3547.319 --> 3554.04
stop that like do you know

3550.619 --> 3557.6600000000003
what is actually gonna get them out

3554.04 --> 3557.66
is it gonna be like

3558.24 --> 3562.799
a missile strike

3560.339 --> 3566.42
from another country

3562.799 --> 3566.42
is that the only way to do it

3567.599 --> 3574.559
I don't know man I I don't know how this

3570.599 --> 3575.7000000000003
works really in in the

3574.559 --> 3577.799
okay

3575.7 --> 3579.54
in the rooms where they're really trying

3577.799 --> 3582.119
to figure this out because these people

3579.54 --> 3584.04
gotta go they gotta get out have to

3582.119 --> 3586.26
leave and there will not be a

3584.04 --> 3588.66
replacement from their stupid little

3586.26 --> 3590.579
party not to be replaced with another

3588.66 --> 3593.04
puppet under control by the same people

3590.579 --> 3596.2400000000002
it's got to stop psycho has got to

3593.04 --> 3596.24
permanently stop

3603.9 --> 3607.099
so how do you do it

3611.46 --> 3614.119
foreign

3622.46 --> 3626.64
[Music]

3624.72 --> 3628.3799999999997
they pay them

3626.64 --> 3631.44
do you understand that you're transfer

3628.38 --> 3633.839
that they pay the date

3631.44 --> 3636.7200000000003
they make their own numbers

3633.839 --> 3639.619
and they're giving them salary raises

3636.72 --> 3639.6189999999997
themselves okay

3640.799 --> 3643.46
foreign

3645.319 --> 3652.5
they've always kind of done that

3648.0 --> 3654.72
secretly and just very sneakily but

3652.5 --> 3656.94
everything is just getting openly

3654.72 --> 3659.339
corrupted now they're just openly doing

3656.94 --> 3660.299
corrupt they are acting like they are in

3659.339 --> 3662.7599999999998
power

3660.299 --> 3664.859
pure like they are literally in full

3662.76 --> 3666.78
power and they can do anything

3664.859 --> 3671.5989999999997
like Nazis

3666.78 --> 3675.0
like like Hitler did they're doing that

3671.599 --> 3677.1600000000003
totally defiant of everything

3675.0 --> 3678.839
they're just doing things

3677.16 --> 3680.46
just keep going they're not getting out

3678.839 --> 3682.2599999999998
they're getting caught and they just

3680.46 --> 3684.119
keep going they don't care they don't

3682.26 --> 3686.3390000000004
give a [ __ ]

3684.119 --> 3689.0
that they're caught

3686.339 --> 3689.0
at all

3690.599 --> 3693.7400000000002
so what do you do then

3707.4 --> 3714.9
right because

3709.339 --> 3716.46
we pay them no they take the tax money

3714.9 --> 3719.099
George Sanford

3716.46 --> 3722.2200000000003
we don't pay them they take the money

3719.099 --> 3725.1600000000003
from us yeah

3722.22 --> 3728.9399999999996
we don't have to push a button

3725.16 --> 3731.7599999999998
to guarantee they get paid no they

3728.94 --> 3734.28
have tax agency

3731.76 --> 3736.92
and the tax agency has police and if you

3734.28 --> 3740.4
don't pay the tax then you get arrested

3736.92 --> 3743.28
if or do you get fined you yeah you get

3740.4 --> 3746.4
kicked out of your house whatever

3743.28 --> 3749.579
that's the reality we don't pay them

3746.4 --> 3751.92
they take the money from us and if we

3749.579 --> 3753.42
don't give it to them then we get kicked

3751.92 --> 3755.94
out in the street

3753.42 --> 3758.9
that's how it works

3755.94 --> 3758.9
George Sanford

3772.319 --> 3777.839
not if you don't let them oh well yeah

3774.839 --> 3779.52
okay well dude if you want to sit in

3777.839 --> 3782.839
your house

3779.52 --> 3782.839
heavily armed

3782.88 --> 3787.98
without any external electricity and all

3785.579 --> 3790.8590000000004
that and just waiting for a SWAT team to

3787.98 --> 3792.78
suddenly jump in and get you

3790.859 --> 3795.66
if that's how you want to live not

3792.78 --> 3798.799
paying taxes like that sure go ahead you

3795.66 --> 3798.799
go ahead and live like that

3799.619 --> 3802.819
it's not much of a life

3804.44 --> 3813.5
right even Jesus said like

3809.339 --> 3813.5
was it Jesus himself yeah

3814.76 --> 3821.7000000000003
like was it

3818.339 --> 3823.68
let Rome's be Rome's ah damn it I'm I'm

3821.7 --> 3825.4199999999996
paraphrasing it terribly but the thing

3823.68 --> 3828.18
is it's just

3825.42 --> 3829.02
you gotta do that because they are you

3828.18 --> 3832.7599999999998
gotta

3829.02 --> 3835.74
give it to the Earth you have to do that

3832.76 --> 3838.26
or you'll like not be able you'll just

3835.74 --> 3841.2
be defending against everything and that

3838.26 --> 3842.4
is all you'll be doing

3841.2 --> 3844.4399999999996
been doing

3842.4 --> 3846.48
Warriors doing okay well maybe that

3844.44 --> 3848.579
works for you maybe if you're under the

3846.48 --> 3851.599
radar enough or something

3848.579 --> 3851.599
good luck with that man

3854.819 --> 3859.34
hey steamy Traveler

3856.09 --> 3859.34
[Music]

3877.079 --> 3879.92
foreign

3883.94 --> 3887.119
lumpy gas

3891.059 --> 3897.799
you know I think about shorts or

3894.18 --> 3897.799
acronyms please

3901.079 --> 3906.38
pushing fossil fuels as a major problem

3906.48 --> 3913.16
ah give to Caesar what is yeah that's it

3909.18 --> 3913.16
that was the quote thanks

3923.88 --> 3927.7200000000003
I hope this isn't an arbitrary show

3926.819 --> 3931.16
today

3927.72 --> 3931.16
a little I guess

3962.16 --> 3968.5099999999998
foreign

3963.51 --> 3968.51
[Music]

3968.599 --> 3972.98
gave me an idea for the title

3974.38 --> 3977.63
[Music]

4008.18 --> 4011.02
foreign

4024.079 --> 4029.3590000000004
give to Caesar

4025.94 --> 4031.539
is that a good message well Jesus said

4029.359 --> 4031.5389999999998
it

4031.96 --> 4037.28
right but it is not just give him

4035.0 --> 4040.42
whatever he wants

4037.28 --> 4040.42
it's just like

4041.18 --> 4046.22
it's basically a message as in don't go

4043.76 --> 4048.26
poking the bee's nest or The Hornet's

4046.22 --> 4051.3799999999997
Nest

4048.26 --> 4053.2990000000004
like it's gonna do its thing it has

4051.38 --> 4056.1800000000003
certain laws

4053.299 --> 4058.7599999999998
it's wise to follow that because not

4056.18 --> 4062.1189999999997
giving it to them will make them come to

4058.76 --> 4064.7200000000003
you and take more

4062.119 --> 4064.7200000000003
foreign

4066.16 --> 4069.2799999999997
of that

4076.64 --> 4082.4
there's also another saying that kind of

4079.099 --> 4084.799
borders that but it's not like biblical

4082.4 --> 4086.2400000000002
I think some comedian came up with that

4084.799 --> 4089.5389999999998
I don't know who

4086.24 --> 4095.5389999999998
was like three things in life

4089.539 --> 4098.54
are certain life death and taxes

4095.539 --> 4099.92
so it's very 20th century style joke

4098.54 --> 4102.94
but

4099.92 --> 4102.9400000000005
it's true

4107.799 --> 4112.88
Christ's basically

4110.48 --> 4115.599999999999
confirms that

4112.88 --> 4115.6
in a sense

4122.359 --> 4127.52
yeah Christ around the Rogan something

4124.58 --> 4128.96
yeah sure you can send it to me just

4127.52 --> 4132.040000000001
email

4128.96 --> 4132.04
it to me then

4135.14 --> 4142.299
Jesus steamy Trevor

4138.5 --> 4142.299
that is really freaking cold

4145.1 --> 4149.54
hey Adam Aiken

4147.199 --> 4152.48
good to see you

4149.54 --> 4154.16
you got the list I take well yeah you

4152.48 --> 4158.299
would have had to

4154.16 --> 4158.299
it's a pretty big list right 22.

4159.799 --> 4164.739
hey Godzilla 37 good to see you

4171.27 --> 4174.379000000001
[Music]

4177.259 --> 4183.14
it threw it to the ground okay that's

4179.66 --> 4186.04
interesting Godzilla because

4183.14 --> 4186.04
well yeah

4187.94 --> 4194.0
don't trade in their money

4190.339 --> 4197.0599999999995
sure that's logical too

4194.0 --> 4201.02
but if you are going to work

4197.06 --> 4203.06
with something at all because I mean it

4201.02 --> 4205.1
becomes really tough not to

4203.06 --> 4208.46
yeah then you have to pay the taxes

4205.1 --> 4211.219
right but hey if you can get about just

4208.46 --> 4214.04
through barter that's legal just barter

4211.219 --> 4216.7390000000005
it's more complicated

4214.04 --> 4219.28
then you don't have to pay taxes if you

4216.739 --> 4219.28
can do that

4219.62 --> 4225.5599999999995
that is very effective

4222.44 --> 4227.78
if you are going to use money

4225.56 --> 4230.06
then

4227.78 --> 4233.0199999999995
try to stick to the rules

4230.06 --> 4233.02
of that money

4233.48 --> 4237.5
he overturned the tables of the money

4235.4 --> 4240.98
yeah in the church

4237.5 --> 4242.84
in the temple itself absolutely

4240.98 --> 4246.699
like that's not what you're supposed to

4242.84 --> 4246.6990000000005
do there in those types of gatherings

4248.48 --> 4253.0599999999995
but I mean he didn't like

4256.34 --> 4262.64
I don't think he actually Jesus was

4258.62 --> 4268.179
never like there should not be any trade

4262.64 --> 4268.179
money shouldn't exist I wasn't like that

4268.28 --> 4272.9
he just didn't like people that were

4271.28 --> 4275.48
obsessed with money

4272.9 --> 4279.46
and for well Divine reasons you could

4275.48 --> 4279.459999999999
say Ada Studio 68

4283.34 --> 4289.34
if we may settled evidence okay Len

4286.699 --> 4292.04
Lennox well I didn't really yeah I think

4289.34 --> 4294.56
it came up like two days ago

4292.04 --> 4296.84
it's been all hyped up

4294.56 --> 4299.2390000000005
man I was watching Alex Jones yesterday

4296.84 --> 4300.9800000000005
I don't even know why I do that really

4299.239 --> 4302.54
but

4300.98 --> 4305.839999999999
God

4302.54 --> 4307.1
he was hyping this [ __ ] out of it and

4305.84 --> 4309.7390000000005
then after

4307.1 --> 4311.4800000000005
the war room or when Shroyer he didn't

4309.739 --> 4313.099999999999
leave it at all he thought it was just a

4311.48 --> 4314.839999999999
giant distraction I kind of agreed with

4313.1 --> 4318.8
him on that

4314.84 --> 4323.2390000000005
but Alex was like Fair porn hyping the

4318.8 --> 4326.659000000001
[ __ ] out of that stupid ass balloon

4323.239 --> 4330.98
I mean he was literally like there's an

4326.659 --> 4333.62
EMP nuke in the balloon and that's uh

4330.98 --> 4335.799999999999
it's like Alex

4333.62 --> 4339.26
Alex

4335.8 --> 4341.6
you really think there's anybody left in

4339.26 --> 4343.820000000001
this world that's gonna buy a [ __ ]

4341.6 --> 4346.76
story like that I mean you could have

4343.82 --> 4349.759999999999
gotten away with that in like

4346.76 --> 4349.76
2003

4350.12 --> 4358.84
maybe 2010 but now I mean come on man

4355.34 --> 4358.84
you can't be serious

4361.64 --> 4367.76
ugh anyway

4364.76 --> 4370.6990000000005
I think it's just I think it's just kind

4367.76 --> 4372.860000000001
of like China being annoying

4370.699 --> 4375.739
like they don't really care I think it's

4372.86 --> 4377.799999999999
just a some kind of a

4375.739 --> 4380.36
project

4377.8 --> 4382.34
and then it's just like okay we're done

4380.36 --> 4386.139999999999
they got the data and then it just

4382.34 --> 4386.14
drifted off and they're like okay

4387.08 --> 4391.94
like sorry it's Flo yeah it's out of our

4390.14 --> 4393.8
space now it

4391.94 --> 4396.699
they probably don't even care if you

4393.8 --> 4396.6990000000005
shoot it down or not

4402.8 --> 4408.860000000001
I think it's literally just a super

4405.32 --> 4412.099999999999
overblown nonsense situation

4408.86 --> 4415.88
of like this stupid territorialism

4412.1 --> 4418.6990000000005
like oh oh we sent our balloon

4415.88 --> 4420.4400000000005
what you gonna do now America

4418.699 --> 4422.86
well America's gotta be fast

4420.44 --> 4425.78
secretly a nuke

4422.86 --> 4428.719
why isn't the government not shooting it

4425.78 --> 4431.5599999999995
down it might be poisonous like come on

4428.719 --> 4431.56
dude it

4437.84 --> 4446.62
it's all really silly and overblown pun

4441.8 --> 4446.62
intended over blown right

4450.26 --> 4458.08
dude if you don't get right with God the

4453.44 --> 4458.08
Chinese EMP nukes will get you

4463.4 --> 4466.0
foreign

4476.42 --> 4480.9800000000005
if there's gonna be

4478.34 --> 4484.2390000000005
very large explosive then they're gonna

4480.98 --> 4484.239
this just like

4484.34 --> 4490.04
boom it it's not gonna be a stupid

4487.699 --> 4491.96
balloon slowly drifting over it's

4490.04 --> 4496.96
ridiculous

4491.96 --> 4496.96
the entire thing is ridiculous

4512.06 --> 4519.5
is cyber blackout yeah right well look

4515.96 --> 4521.78
it might literally be a fake out and

4519.5 --> 4523.1
they might plan to just like turn off

4521.78 --> 4525.5
the switches it's like oh they're

4523.1 --> 4528.620000000001
turning out at Ground just turning it

4525.5 --> 4532.04
off click and then like oh no it wasn't

4528.62 --> 4534.26
EMP attack yeah they just [ __ ] turn

4532.04 --> 4538.46
off the power and the internet probably

4534.26 --> 4540.1990000000005
then like actively ordered to like

4538.46 --> 4541.82
military standing there turn it off

4540.199 --> 4544.54
right now

4541.82 --> 4544.54
like that

4546.14 --> 4551.3
there's no freaking way that that's

4548.6 --> 4554.26
gonna be an actual EMP attack it's just

4551.3 --> 4554.26
so ridiculous

4559.219 --> 4563.42
enough for everybody to shut down

4561.26 --> 4566.08
flights

4563.42 --> 4566.08

what you think it's American

4646.159 --> 4652.54
okay skeptic93 there

4649.64 --> 4652.54
could be

4653.12 --> 4657.62

4655.1 --> 4658.9400000000005
there's a lot of yeah sad loons really

4657.62 --> 4661.28
high up

maybe but is it guidance control or this

4661.28 --> 4663.699
is just

4666.14 --> 4669.64
lost pressure or something

4670.34 --> 4674.3
maybe the balloon got hit by a micro

4672.5 --> 4677.3
meteorite

4674.3 --> 4677.3
laughs

4680.84 --> 4683.62

4915.32 --> 4919.299999999999

4923.12 --> 4927.98
I had actually a pic like an actual

4925.88 --> 4931.64
photograph of like one of those

4927.98 --> 4934.58
Illuminati croissants of mine that

4931.64 --> 4939.02
I was very specific in the chat

4954.199 --> 4959.12
description

4956.42 --> 4961.58
that's my email this is a one email

4959.12 --> 4965.96

4968.659 --> 4973.96
and turn a photo in canister what do you

4971.54 --> 4973.96
mean can't

4977.42 --> 4980.42
foreign

4983.0 --> 4985.9
why not

4987.219 --> 4990.76
we'll look [ __ ]

4992.719 --> 4998.02
why

4994.699 --> 4998.0199999999995
not if it's simple

4998.43 --> 5001.529
[Music]

5018.04 --> 5020.46
foreign

5020.679 --> 5025.2390000000005
I mean if it's just like a photo of the

5023.26 --> 5027.96
Illuminati Hassan and you can basically

5025.239 --> 5027.959999999999
ah damn it

5034.08 --> 5037.739
yeah sorry

5038.32 --> 5043.5599999999995
yeah you can just cut the cousin out and

5041.38 --> 5043.56
then

5043.6 --> 5048.76
I mean it it would be the triangle

5045.94 --> 5050.86
because if it's just a triangle then

5048.76 --> 5053.8
yeah it's just gonna seem like just a

5050.86 --> 5055.98
triangle or yeah Illuminati pyramid or

5053.8 --> 5055.9800000000005
something

5062.98 --> 5066.718999999999
I want to see what it looks like

5068.98 --> 5076.32
but I've seen it I mean I've seen

5071.8 --> 5076.320000000001
emoticons before that are like photos

5078.76 --> 5081.06
foreign

5096.719 --> 5103.659
maybe that's just over at Discord I mean

5100.48 --> 5107.08
Adam have you seen like in Discord they

5103.659 --> 5109.41
have emoticons that are just pictures

5107.08 --> 5113.0689999999995
amen

5109.41 --> 5113.0689999999995
[Music]

5135.28 --> 5143.08
yeah before you continue with that

5138.84 --> 5146.1990000000005
Illuminati croissant picture

5143.08 --> 5148.3
but chat resolution is low I know

5146.199 --> 5149.98
but it's a really simple shape I mean

5148.3 --> 5152.92
that castle Yeah that's going to be

5149.98 --> 5154.36
tough but I'm just gonna try to find a

5152.92 --> 5158.219
photo

5154.36 --> 5158.219
maybe there's like a store photo

5158.35 --> 5161.459000000001
[Music]

5301.36 --> 5304.32
foreign

5350.94 --> 5357.54
yep yeah that was sound was gone for a

5353.86 --> 5357.54
bit but I found a photo

5359.02 --> 5363.4800000000005
though it's not oriented correctly

5364.82 --> 5367.938999999999
[Music]

5371.98 --> 5376.44
it's the same photos over and over again

5376.78 --> 5380.5599999999995
but there's one that looks exactly like

5378.88 --> 5382.78
the thing that I

5380.56 --> 5385.360000000001
Gap

5382.78 --> 5388.5599999999995
looks like that is the product but yeah

5385.36 --> 5388.5599999999995
it's not angled right

5389.5 --> 5393.9
but I can definitely send you that

5404.139 --> 5407.219
I hope this works

5407.98 --> 5413.0199999999995
right I send it to you

5410.8 --> 5415.659000000001
Adam

5413.02 --> 5418.139
now if you just turn that with yeah but

5415.659 --> 5418.138999999999
it's like

5418.48 --> 5423.699
I guess you could like turn it with the

5421.179 --> 5425.9800000000005
long side down it's still kind of

5423.699 --> 5429.9
asymmetrical then but I mean that's like

5425.98 --> 5429.9
that's at least what it looks like

5432.76 --> 5439.56
it's like cheese on toast

5436.48 --> 5439.5599999999995
yeah but it isn't

5440.139 --> 5445.4800000000005
it's kind of yeah it has depth to it

5443.739 --> 5448.0199999999995
it's not just a flat thing with cheese

5445.48 --> 5448.0199999999995
on it

5448.239 --> 5450.54
foreign

5451.239 --> 5456.759999999999
it's either that or I get

5454.239 --> 5459.099999999999
you know

5456.76 --> 5463.56
one of those and then have a photo of it

5459.1 --> 5463.56
but yeah I can't do that right now so

5468.699 --> 5473.04
what do you mean ask the check what

5470.44 --> 5473.04
works best

5476.679 --> 5482.4400000000005
okay okay yeah I could show it I guess

5479.139 --> 5485.34
but I mean they know what Illuminati

5482.44 --> 5485.339999999999
custom looks like

5487.48 --> 5490.48
foreign

5505.84 --> 5508.84
no

5509.139 --> 5516.4800000000005
why is this not working damn it oh come

5514.3 --> 5516.4800000000005
on

5520.08 --> 5525.6
whatever man [ __ ] obs

5527.62 --> 5530.46
don't work again

5533.5 --> 5539.28
oh oh now it works oh yes of course

5539.62 --> 5544.679
just my keyboard's old right so anyway

5541.96 --> 5544.679
this is

5546.699 --> 5551.44
did you check not yet

5549.699 --> 5554.379999999999
I'm kind of in the middle of something

5551.44 --> 5556.96
turret right but anybody everybody knows

5554.38 --> 5559.6
that that first one is not an Illuminati

5556.96 --> 5563.04
song the second one is what that looks

5559.6 --> 5563.04
like right guys

5568.54 --> 5573.719
I'm gonna check your email right now

5571.12 --> 5573.719
Tarot

5586.719 --> 5591.219
no

5588.36 --> 5595.139
absolutely not

5591.219 --> 5595.139
how is that gonna form an emoticon

5595.78 --> 5600.94
I appreciate the effort there it is

5598.179 --> 5603.159
really funny but that's not absolutely

5600.94 --> 5605.199
not what I was talking about

5603.159 --> 5609.28
you've made an entire hand and then just

5605.199 --> 5611.86
put Joe Rogan's face on the thumb that's

5609.28 --> 5616.179
not what I had in mind at all

5611.86 --> 5619.96
it has to actually be just a thumb just

5616.179 --> 5622.4800000000005
a thumb with two dots and a half a

5619.96 --> 5624.94
circle as a smiley on it and little

5622.48 --> 5627.58
headphones that was it

5624.94 --> 5631.0199999999995
this is not it

5627.58 --> 5631.0199999999995
but thank you for trying though

5638.32 --> 5642.12
so I did

5643.96 --> 5649.96
Oh you mean the the photo thing that you

5647.32 --> 5653.28
okay sure I'll show that

5649.96 --> 5653.28
funny and all but

5661.84 --> 5668.02
I mean it is funny but it's just nothing

5664.96 --> 5672.42
like my Illuminati costume so it kind of

5668.02 --> 5672.42
makes no sense then that's a joke

5676.08 --> 5683.08
no tear it I'm not just going to do that

5679.84 --> 5685.179
yeah you can't just throw [ __ ] at me and

5683.08 --> 5687.34
then tell me oh yeah his members decide

5685.179 --> 5690.42
no I decide

5687.34 --> 5690.42
I decide

5693.88 --> 5696.54
okay

5700.659 --> 5707.138999999999
I'm not gonna let you guys just arrange

5703.719 --> 5710.56
how my channel is gonna be okay

5707.139 --> 5712.06
I mean I'll take suggestion sure

5710.56 --> 5716.820000000001
but I've

5712.06 --> 5716.820000000001
I've got in my mind how I wanted to look

5718.78 --> 5724.36
otherwise I could just like oh just some

5721.659 --> 5725.92
random [ __ ] that's out there I'll just

5724.36 --> 5728.44
put this in there oh this looks kind of

5725.92 --> 5731.58
cool without it yeah no no that's not

5728.44 --> 5735.78
the point it has to actually be

5731.58 --> 5735.78
directly related to my show

5736.179 --> 5741.52
otherwise what's the point

5739.179 --> 5744.52
could just throw anything at oh you want

5741.52 --> 5746.92
more stuff you want more stuff oh I'll

5744.52 --> 5748.620000000001
just play videos that I find all the

5746.92 --> 5751.54
time maybe it could have more

5748.62 --> 5755.26
flashlights and disco balls and colors

5751.54 --> 5758.739
everywhere and it'll pop up the thing is

5755.26 --> 5762.3
is that what you want then no

5758.739 --> 5762.299999999999
that's not this show

5762.58 --> 5768.12
yeah I'm not some freaking Carnival

5765.159 --> 5768.12
attraction okay

5768.78 --> 5772.5599999999995
it has to make sense

5773.26 --> 5777.9400000000005
makes no sense to you well then you

5775.48 --> 5779.638999999999
don't get it Adam then you just don't

5777.94 --> 5782.32
get it

5779.639 --> 5783.58
send that image from Terra to me well

5782.32 --> 5785.08
fine

5783.58 --> 5786.94
but if this is you're gonna be your

5785.08 --> 5789.28
attitude then I don't want it because

5786.94 --> 5792.04
you literally didn't listen to my

5789.28 --> 5796.38
instructions I gave you very specific

5792.04 --> 5800.04
instructions Adam an entire page of it

5796.38 --> 5800.04
meticulously detailed

5800.26 --> 5804.820000000001
that's not what you want to do then I

5803.5 --> 5807.3
guess I'm gonna have to do it myself

5804.82 --> 5807.299999999999
then

5821.56 --> 5826.38
right here's carrot's picture

5827.56 --> 5830.639
not using that

5831.159 --> 5835.86
just trying to help I'm not talking to

5833.62 --> 5835.86
you

5838.54 --> 5843.239
turret

5840.28 --> 5843.239
talking to Adam

5843.639 --> 5849.82
I know you meant well it's just not

5846.94 --> 5852.78
the idea I had

5849.82 --> 5852.78
hey LSG

5875.98 --> 5878.638999999999
foreign

5879.76 --> 5884.6990000000005
they're just trying to help yeah I get

5882.28 --> 5887.62
that it's really nice to have help

5884.699 --> 5891.159
steamy traveler but not if they're

5887.62 --> 5893.5
specifically going to like oh no not not

5891.159 --> 5896.98
this no let's do it completely different

5893.5 --> 5900.14
no then let's not do it

5896.98 --> 5900.139999999999

5905.679 --> 5911.1
will not convert to any decent

5908.62 --> 5911.099999999999

5914.8 --> 5920.38
I don't

5917.739 --> 5922.839999999999
wouldn't it

5920.38 --> 5925.06
well this photo isn't this is like the

5922.84 --> 5926.860000000001
only photo the Illuminati croissant that

5925.06 --> 5928.360000000001
I found that's the only one I found

5926.86 --> 5931.839999999999
online

5928.36 --> 5935.0199999999995
already said I'll probably take an

5931.84 --> 5936.82
actual photograph of it I can't do that

5935.02 --> 5938.38
right now

5936.82 --> 5941.4
so

5938.38 --> 5941.400000000001
not right now

5947.02 --> 5950.02
foreign

5977.199 --> 5980.199
foreign

5984.46 --> 5987.3
wow

5990.219 --> 5998.32
so nobody ever apparently in history

5994.54 --> 6001.32
made a photograph of a thumb with a face

5998.32 --> 6006.0199999999995
drawn on it and a headphones

6001.32 --> 6006.0199999999995
apparently nobody's ever done that

6008.94 --> 6014.12
because Google just doesn't understand

6016.219 --> 6021.08
nobody's ever made a photograph of that

6022.86 --> 6026.96
just as a joke that is just

6043.199 --> 6046.82
okay so let's see

6047.28 --> 6053.54
thumb with face draw oh well that does

6050.34 --> 6056.88
exist but not with the headphones

6053.54 --> 6059.58
okay not with the headphones nobody's

6056.88 --> 6062.42
ever done that oh wait except here but

6059.58 --> 6062.42
that's not a photo

6066.659 --> 6071.04
apparently people draw faces on thumbs

6069.36 --> 6073.679
regularly

6071.04 --> 6076.0199999999995
well it's a whole thing here apparently

6073.679 --> 6078.4400000000005
but I haven't seen any with headphones

6076.02 --> 6078.4400000000005
though

6079.62 --> 6086.28
apparently

6081.48 --> 6089.638999999999
human thumbs and headphones don't mix

6086.28 --> 6093.86
in photo land nobody ever thought that

6089.639 --> 6093.86
it might be funny to do that apparently

6100.08 --> 6103.28
that's weird

6105.0 --> 6108.8
I thought I'd find one

6119.699 --> 6124.199
I'm trying to change ideas represent

6122.699 --> 6126.239
something more visually in this but

6124.199 --> 6128.219
right okay well then it's just not gonna

6126.239 --> 6131.218999999999
be what I had in mind then

6128.219 --> 6131.219
Adam

6137.04 --> 6140.17
[Music]

6155.78 --> 6161.5199999999995
all right well I guess then in that case

6159.0 --> 6163.32
yeah I guess you could just see what you

6161.52 --> 6165.2390000000005
can make of it but

6163.32 --> 6168.32
then it's probably not gonna work out

6165.239 --> 6168.32
the way I thought it would

6173.46 --> 6179.28
anyway sorry being I'm just kind of

6177.0 --> 6181.199
disappointed that

6179.28 --> 6183.92
I thought it would be pretty

6181.199 --> 6183.919999999999
straightforward

6187.86 --> 6192.299999999999
but maybe it also has to do with the

6189.78 --> 6195.36
coloring palette

6192.3 --> 6196.92
that is available for emoticons that's

6195.36 --> 6200.599999999999
just not

6196.92 --> 6200.6
full range enough or something

6219.9 --> 6222.5599999999995
hmm

6223.98 --> 6229.799999999999
great

6226.26 --> 6232.58
okay well okay well then just see what

6229.8 --> 6232.58
we can do and

6232.699 --> 6239.239
ah maybe I got a little over

6235.32 --> 6239.239
enthusiastic yesterday about it

6241.84 --> 6246.05
[Music]

6246.96 --> 6250.1
I'm fine

6262.74 --> 6265.898999999999
[Music]

6272.88 --> 6282.429
foreign

6274.83 --> 6282.429
[Music]

6312.54 --> 6315.199
hmm

6318.44 --> 6323.94
right yeah Adam I mean at this angle it

6321.659 --> 6327.78
would look kind of weird

6323.94 --> 6331.0199999999995
it's just it's so asymmetrical it's like

6327.78 --> 6335.0599999999995
at an angle it's just it should be held

6331.02 --> 6335.06
up like straight up like that but

6335.219 --> 6341.84
I mean if it would have the right angles

6338.159 --> 6341.839999999999
it would be very recognizable

6342.239 --> 6347.54
because now it just seems like an

6344.1 --> 6347.54
asymmetrical triangle

6353.28 --> 6360.239
or toast if you will right so I guess

6357.179 --> 6361.38
don't use this Photograph just hold on

6360.239 --> 6363.599999999999
until

6361.38 --> 6367.28
I get one and we can make a proper

6363.6 --> 6367.280000000001
photograph of it okay

6367.38 --> 6371.119
is that doable

6382.02 --> 6389.280000000001
around triangle I [ __ ] well I don't

6385.82 --> 6391.94
Brown it will be just kind of yellowish

6389.28 --> 6391.94
and brown

6395.1 --> 6401.780000000001
as long as it kind of looks like an

6397.8 --> 6401.78
Illuminati costume I'm good with it

6402.119 --> 6407.339999999999
and then you could probably even

6404.76 --> 6409.52
make a little symbol of an eye on it or

6407.34 --> 6409.52
something

6426.56 --> 6432.3
steamy traveler I agree

6429.54 --> 6436.28
Adam Meekins Illuminati croissant was

6432.3 --> 6436.28
very recognizable straight to the point

6436.619 --> 6442.679
it just isn't the Illuminati croissant

6440.58 --> 6445.0199999999995
it's like oh cool do you got the word

6442.679 --> 6445.9800000000005
yeah but every when I do it then it's

6445.02 --> 6450.860000000001
like yeah

6445.98 --> 6450.86
that is not the emoticon

6455.58 --> 6461.239
only you would recognize yours

6458.639 --> 6461.2390000000005
well

6461.4 --> 6465.08
until I hold one up

6466.739 --> 6472.32
I don't know if it would be that

6468.659 --> 6474.48
unrecognizable I have no idea

6472.32 --> 6478.0199999999995
exactly what that looks like you haven't

6474.48 --> 6480.0599999999995
literally shown me the actual Smiley

6478.02 --> 6484.040000000001
version of it yet

6480.06 --> 6484.04
so I don't know how bad it looks

6484.26 --> 6488.4800000000005
all I've seen so far is just photos

6491.58 --> 6494.659
hello Sean G

6499.92 --> 6506.119
oh

6502.02 --> 6506.119000000001
okay OSG a sore throat

6506.159 --> 6510.138999999999
try some colloidal silver with that

6512.1 --> 6515.3
that should help great

6541.5 --> 6544.5
foreign

6563.65 --> 6566.87
[Music]

6588.119 --> 6591.119
foreign

6599.06 --> 6605.76
there okay well fine then okay you just

6603.06 --> 6607.320000000001
do it that then okay you just forget

6605.76 --> 6610.08
about it forget about everything you

6607.32 --> 6612.84
said you just work it out Adam

6610.08 --> 6615.719
and just make it that way the

6612.84 --> 6618.179
recognizable way and I'll just like let

6615.719 --> 6620.76
that all go no more photo

6618.179 --> 6623.82
there's no photos gonna be in there in

6620.76 --> 6626.52
any form you just draw it the way you

6623.82 --> 6628.5
think it'll work Adam because

6626.52 --> 6630.4800000000005
the way that I thought is not going to

6628.5 --> 6634.8
work apparently and I'm not getting an

6630.48 --> 6637.138999999999
example so far so fine everybody agrees

6634.8 --> 6640.400000000001
with you and not with me so then do it

6637.139 --> 6640.400000000001
that way then fine

6640.56 --> 6644.179
you don't have to be happy about it

6645.24 --> 6648.29
[Music]

6649.26 --> 6651.5
foreign

6652.46 --> 6658.5
[Music]

6654.02 --> 6661.080000000001
that my idea didn't work out that's all

6658.5 --> 6664.82
because that's specifically what I had

6661.08 --> 6664.82
in mind when I started doing this

6677.1 --> 6682.6990000000005
I guess I'm kind of used to like d live

6679.98 --> 6686.099999999999
standards because in dear life you got

6682.699 --> 6687.9
actual photographic animated imagery

6686.1 --> 6689.9400000000005
little gifts

6687.9 --> 6693.259999999999
but yeah those are much better

6689.94 --> 6696.0
resolution and much bigger also than

6693.26 --> 6698.1
emoticons in YouTube

6696.0 --> 6702.06
so fine fair enough

6698.1 --> 6704.58
I'll just be annoyed that the idea that

6702.06 --> 6708.56
I wanted to do this entire thing for

6704.58 --> 6708.5599999999995
just doesn't exist then

6709.32 --> 6713.699
I was wrong and everybody else is right

6712.08 --> 6716.04
okay

6713.699 --> 6719.78
fine you got you got it

6716.04 --> 6719.78
I was wrong you're right

6727.82 --> 6733.08
[Music]

6730.26 --> 6735.179
so just do the Illuminati Castle on your

6733.08 --> 6738.78
way and do all the other things that way

6735.179 --> 6742.4
too doesn't matter if it's recognizable

6738.78 --> 6742.4
for any item I guess

6743.28 --> 6747.0599999999995
although I don't know how the hell

6745.139 --> 6749.46
you're gonna do to mirror coffee then

6747.06 --> 6751.5
like how the [ __ ] are you gonna do to

6749.46 --> 6753.179
mirror coffee in a way that actually is

6751.5 --> 6754.5
comprehensible it's just gonna be a

6753.179 --> 6755.9400000000005
coffee

6754.5 --> 6757.8
what you're going to make the coffee

6755.94 --> 6759.839999999999
slightly different color how the hell

6757.8 --> 6762.719
are you gonna convey then that it's a

6759.84 --> 6765.619000000001
tomato coffee I don't know I don't know

6762.719 --> 6765.619
how you're gonna do that

6785.36 --> 6791.719
don't don't want to do it now

6788.88 --> 6791.719
please

6793.739 --> 6798.0
I'm gonna move on with the show this is

6796.199 --> 6800.9
getting on my nerves

6798.0 --> 6804.199
yeah Adam is a great guy we get it

6800.9 --> 6804.199
he is

6829.619 --> 6835.759999999999
the arbitrary Cassandra

6832.739 --> 6835.759999999999
very funny

6839.46 --> 6844.46
right so let's talk about something else

6842.159 --> 6844.46
now

6848.88 --> 6852.32
I'm thinking about what

6864.78 --> 6867.78
foreign

6876.36 --> 6881.88
God damn it

6880.26 --> 6884.159000000001
[ __ ] new

6881.88 --> 6886.7390000000005
okay my mood is [ __ ] ruined it's not

6884.159 --> 6889.259999999999
gonna get any better it's [ __ ] ruined

6886.739 --> 6891.239
it's over

6889.26 --> 6893.58
this is now officially become a [ __ ]

6891.239 --> 6896.699
show and I'm probably to blame for it

6893.58 --> 6899.159
I'm [ __ ] pissed off now now the

6896.699 --> 6901.619
trolls are getting in and whining to I

6899.159 --> 6905.9
don't have anything to talk about

6901.619 --> 6905.9
and yeah my idea is ruined

6914.02 --> 6917.2390000000005
[Music]

6920.719 --> 6928.34
Temple pastries logo I don't know that

6925.26 --> 6928.34
never heard of that

6943.4 --> 6949.0199999999995
that's hilarious

6945.78 --> 6952.04
but I mean Adam's version is better

6949.02 --> 6952.040000000001
a lot better

6972.06 --> 6978.38
can we see

6974.76 --> 6978.38
didn't I already show you

6984.78 --> 6988.28
fine I'll show you

7009.38 --> 7015.46
there that's what that looks like Temple

7012.98 --> 7015.459999999999
pastries

7016.46 --> 7019.119
okay

7039.199 --> 7044.138999999999
vector image yes correct a Como virus

7086.719 --> 7089.199
foreign

7104.5 --> 7109.76
but look Adam

7107.119 --> 7113.598999999999
you're Illuminati Castle thing is fine

7109.76 --> 7116.2390000000005
it's better it works you just understand

7113.599 --> 7117.9800000000005
better how emoticons work you're making

7116.239 --> 7120.919999999999
them apparently

7117.98 --> 7123.44
I had an idea in mine and it's just the

7120.92 --> 7125.36
entire idea is just literally that

7123.44 --> 7127.94
entire thing that fueled my inspiration

7125.36 --> 7130.699
yesterday is literally entirely in the

7127.94 --> 7132.44
garbage can now so yeah I'm a little

7130.699 --> 7136.098999999999
ticked off

7132.44 --> 7139.219
because now it's something happening

7136.099 --> 7142.3
that wasn't my idea

7139.219 --> 7142.3
and I'm ticked off

7142.639 --> 7146.08
and it's not your fault

7146.719 --> 7149.139
Adam

7161.86 --> 7164.92
thank you

7168.44 --> 7173.96
a steamy traveler how about you stop

7171.86 --> 7176.719
trying to push me

7173.96 --> 7179.06
it's getting on my nerve dude

7176.719 --> 7180.9800000000005
I don't need your advice and you I

7179.06 --> 7184.34
definitely don't need to hear you say no

7180.98 --> 7186.5
biggie okay I'll be determined

7184.34 --> 7188.3
the determining Factor whether I

7186.5 --> 7190.82
experience something as a biggie or not

7188.3 --> 7192.619000000001
and if I'm pissed off I'm [ __ ] pissed

7190.82 --> 7195.82
off and you're not gonna tell me no

7192.619 --> 7195.82
biggie okay

7198.08 --> 7200.08
um

7211.43 --> 7218.7390000000005
[Music]

7214.36 --> 7218.739
screw you yeah bye

7222.76 --> 7227.659000000001
okay

7224.38 --> 7229.82
not orange you know

7227.659 --> 7231.259999999999
oh that could work

7229.82 --> 7233.199
Adam that's

7231.26 --> 7236.119000000001
I mean

7233.199 --> 7238.28
yeah if it's surrounded by black but if

7236.119 --> 7240.32
it's white wouldn't that would you even

7238.28 --> 7242.179
see it

7240.32 --> 7243.44
but I mean I guess at this point it's

7242.179 --> 7247.719
fine

7243.44 --> 7247.719
I mean as long as it's recognizable

7251.48 --> 7257.9
but the yeah the coffee could be a real

7253.88 --> 7260.3
challenge if you want that small so

7257.9 --> 7262.339999999999
you're yeah you're still presenting just

7260.3 --> 7264.7390000000005
large pictures to me so this doesn't

7262.34 --> 7267.5
look like a smiley or yeah at all it's

7264.739 --> 7269.36
not pixelated like I can't tell how

7267.5 --> 7271.96
that's gonna look when it's actually an

7269.36 --> 7271.96
emoticon

7275.06 --> 7280.4800000000005
you see a bunch of trying what are you

7277.159 --> 7280.48
talking about a coma virus

7323.9 --> 7329.0199999999995
okay

7325.52 --> 7329.02
about six then

7329.96 --> 7335.56
right well I guess that

7332.0 --> 7335.56
things like uh

7336.739 --> 7342.5599999999995
the Black Swan is not going to be tough

7339.139 --> 7344.86
vulture Angel spoons should be pretty

7342.56 --> 7344.860000000001
simple

7351.08 --> 7356.239
but I mean the rumpus

7353.659 --> 7359.0
it might look grainy but

7356.239 --> 7360.739
it's it still has to be based on the

7359.0 --> 7364.719
picture because that's the only thing

7360.739 --> 7364.718999999999
that we have of him

7365.179 --> 7370.34
so even if it's going to be just about a

7367.58 --> 7372.8
little block with some red and white and

7370.34 --> 7374.719
brownish and it's barely recognizable as

7372.8 --> 7377.8
a human being it doesn't matter it has

7374.719 --> 7377.8
to be that photo

7378.86 --> 7384.219
it really has to even if it's not

7381.5 --> 7384.219
recognizable

7388.099 --> 7392.139
because otherwise there's just no point

7396.139 --> 7398.8
foreign

7406.04 --> 7409.04
like

7414.139 --> 7419.42
photo identical or in that direction

7416.54 --> 7422.119
I'll be very happy and I'll get my my

7419.42 --> 7425.36
good mood back if I just can have

7422.119 --> 7428.48
the rumpus I don't even understand why

7425.36 --> 7432.58
Nathan doesn't even have a the rumpus

7428.48 --> 7432.58
oh probably because he [ __ ] hates him

7432.86 --> 7437.799999999999
but I want that one I'm making my mark

7440.54 --> 7444.099
if I can have a the rumpus photo

7442.639 --> 7446.719
identical

7444.099 --> 7450.52
emoticon even though it's pixelated as

7446.719 --> 7450.52
[ __ ] I'll be very happy again

7453.739 --> 7459.86
early bird gets to work yeah I was just

7457.219 --> 7462.58
thinking of the early bird which would

7459.86 --> 7462.58
be like a robin

7462.619 --> 7468.5199999999995
if a robin bird

7464.84 --> 7468.52
and it can be cartoony

7473.3 --> 7478.219
right you could basically do the bird

7476.48 --> 7480.379999999999
emoticon

7478.219 --> 7483.38
and then just rearrange its color

7480.38 --> 7486.400000000001
slightly so that'll look like a robin I

7483.38 --> 7486.400000000001
mean that would work fine

7488.239 --> 7494.379999999999
there was a rumpus emote on the I know

7490.88 --> 7494.38
akumo virus I know

7497.239 --> 7502.28
I mean if those it Adam could you

7500.179 --> 7504.7390000000005
basically rip Emoji guns from the

7502.28 --> 7507.139
Discord server because there's a lot of

7504.739 --> 7509.5599999999995
really good ones there including the

7507.139 --> 7509.56
rumpus

7509.659 --> 7517.239
but there might be others too like for

7511.82 --> 7517.239
example a troll or the Black Swan

7522.92 --> 7527.42
there might even be a Rogan's thumb

7525.159 --> 7530.32
thingy there

7527.42 --> 7530.32
who knows

7560.9 --> 7568.839999999999
all right so anyway sorry for the moved

7564.679 --> 7568.84
crash earlier it's just that

7569.719 --> 7576.76
you might be catching on that if I am

7572.78 --> 7576.759999999999
annoyed with something

7578.179 --> 7583.34
and I don't personally say oh it's okay

7581.42 --> 7586.4
don't worry about it I'm just letting it

7583.34 --> 7588.26
go right if I'm annoyed don't freaking

7586.4 --> 7592.759999999999
tell me

7588.26 --> 7597.280000000001
as an outsider to not it's no biggie

7592.76 --> 7597.280000000001
calm down like don't do that

7598.4 --> 7603.0199999999995
it's not

7599.96 --> 7605.119
working it doesn't that does not calm me

7603.02 --> 7607.219
down it just makes me more agitated it

7605.119 --> 7609.139
always does if I'm gonna be pissed off

7607.219 --> 7610.88
about something just let me be pissed

7609.139 --> 7614.36
off at something

7610.88 --> 7618.5
only way is to move on and then maybe

7614.36 --> 7621.92
when I moved on then afterward I'll

7618.5 --> 7624.619
naturally calm down and then get a

7621.92 --> 7626.9
better more clear perspective on it

7624.619 --> 7630.86
but when I'm in the middle of being

7626.9 --> 7633.5599999999995
annoyed don't shush me

7630.86 --> 7635.839999999999
really aggravating to me

7633.56 --> 7639.639
okay

7635.84 --> 7639.639
steamy traveler just don't do that

7657.38 --> 7663.639
whoa the show is already been going over

7659.48 --> 7663.638999999999
two hours I can't believe it huh

7667.659 --> 7673.299999999999
I guess it's been very arbitrary or

7671.119 --> 7673.299999999999
something

7675.08 --> 7681.44
but in a way yeah it has actually been

7677.48 --> 7684.5599999999995
arbitrary as in all over the place

7681.44 --> 7687.5
not really specifically about a subject

7684.56 --> 7690.8
too much other than

7687.5 --> 7694.659
Jim Bob overusing the word arbitrary and

7690.8 --> 7694.659000000001
I think slightly out of context

7696.5 --> 7699.5
foreign

7708.08 --> 7713.78
but I think I'm going to round out the

7710.119 --> 7716.659
show now but it's gone on for two hours

7713.78 --> 7719.0
still feel pretty good though I mean now

7716.659 --> 7721.339999999999
that I'm my mood is slightly restored

7719.0 --> 7725.179
with the prospect in mind that I'll have

7721.34 --> 7727.82
a durampus emoticon which I will laugh

7725.179 --> 7729.8
over pretty much every time I see it I

7727.82 --> 7732.0199999999995
guarantee you

7729.8 --> 7734.06
every time somebody's using that in my

7732.02 --> 7736.040000000001
chat I'm gonna have a small little

7734.06 --> 7739.4800000000005
giggle inside

7736.04 --> 7739.48
and that makes me very happy

7742.04 --> 7746.3
hey tiger bear saw me and Jim Bob the

7744.92 --> 7747.1990000000005
other day you didn't know I had a

7746.3 --> 7748.6990000000005
channel

7747.199 --> 7750.799999999999
right

7748.699 --> 7753.5
well yeah thanks for being here welcome

7750.8 --> 7755.54
to the flatters early bird show

7753.5 --> 7759.32
I'm a little bit over the place I'm not

7755.54 --> 7762.679
as super entertainment fluid as people

7759.32 --> 7766.46
like Jim Bob and old Benjamin

7762.679 --> 7770.0
even in a way like flat side

7766.46 --> 7773.3
they're also fluid and I I just have

7770.0 --> 7775.58
moments where I'm just not fluent and so

7773.3 --> 7777.92
I don't get all stuttery or anything but

7775.58 --> 7779.659
I just like either I don't know what to

7777.92 --> 7780.9800000000005
say or I'm looking for something and I'm

7779.659 --> 7784.638999999999
getting too focused on and then they

7780.98 --> 7787.459999999999
take like minutes so yeah there's weird

7784.639 --> 7789.8
like unusual silent moments here because

7787.46 --> 7793.159
it's just very live

7789.8 --> 7795.4400000000005
and I'm not just somebody playing offer

7793.159 --> 7796.58
tapes keep everybody's attention all the

7795.44 --> 7800.36
time

7796.58 --> 7803.54
although sometimes when I get going when

7800.36 --> 7805.639
I'm inspired then I do do that and then

7803.54 --> 7807.739
I talk for like 10 or 15 minutes

7805.639 --> 7809.54
straight

7807.739 --> 7811.339999999999
but that doesn't help that doesn't

7809.54 --> 7813.739
happen continue that's only when I'm

7811.34 --> 7815.42
just genuinely honestly inspired by

7813.739 --> 7818.739
something

7815.42 --> 7823.179
so I hope you guys can sit through that

7818.739 --> 7823.178999999999
sit through that way of doing a show

7823.58 --> 7828.199
or most people that typically hang

7825.26 --> 7829.76
around here and have wrenches they can

7828.199 --> 7832.098999999999
because otherwise they wouldn't be

7829.76 --> 7833.599
hanging around and having wrenches

7832.099 --> 7836.06
anyway

7833.599 --> 7839.360000000001
good to have you I always like newcomers

7836.06 --> 7841.280000000001
and I've been getting some newcomers

7839.36 --> 7844.28
also it's just through appearing in the

7841.28 --> 7845.9
chat I've read the Han experience but

7844.28 --> 7848.96
through Jim Bob and of course through

7845.9 --> 7851.0

7848.96 --> 7854.0

7851.0 --> 7856.719
Flat Earth debates

7854.0 --> 7856.719
so

7856.82 --> 7860.54
right but I hope you've been enjoying

7858.86 --> 7862.96
the show it's been kind of arbitrary

7860.54 --> 7866.96
though

7862.96 --> 7866.96
