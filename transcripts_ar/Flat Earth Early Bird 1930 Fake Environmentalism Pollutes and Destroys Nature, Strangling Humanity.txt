humidity

238.439 --> 242.76
right what did I do oh

242.84 --> 250.20000000000002
yeah yeah I watched the new movie on

246.76 --> 253.04
Netflix unexpected bump

250.2 --> 257.87899999999996
in the movie

253.04 --> 257.879
Solace turned out to be highly

257.959 --> 264.479
interesting didn't expect it to

261.04 --> 266.88
be but yeah it was very

264.479 --> 269.4
captivating basically thought like oh I

266.88 --> 271.12
I'll just watch a little bit of it but

269.4 --> 274.32
then I watched the entire

271.12 --> 276.68
movie was quite fascinating hey LSG good

274.32 --> 276.68
to see

295.4 --> 301.4
you oh it's some 2015 movie

302.759 --> 305.039
yeah

306.44 --> 309.919
with Anthony

310.52 --> 315.0
Hopkins and it was really a movie down

313.039 --> 318.08
his

315.0 --> 321.4
Lane and it was just

318.08 --> 321.4
interesting an

327.039 --> 331.56
unusual cuz you first think like this is

329.919 --> 334.919
going to

331.56 --> 339.0
be just like some kind of detective

334.919 --> 343.24
thing but it's like really

339.0 --> 344.84
about people with like pretty heavy

343.24 --> 348.24
paranormal

344.84 --> 351.52
ability basically being yeah having this

348.24 --> 354.28000000000003
Vision capability that is really

351.52 --> 354.28
absurdly

355.08 --> 360.96
strong

356.759 --> 363.68
and some really

360.96 --> 366.4
interesting philosophical perspectives

363.68 --> 368.319
with that so like the whole thing really

366.4 --> 372.28
like had a bit of a like almost science

368.319 --> 372.28000000000003
fiction trait to it

372.4 --> 378.19899999999996
spiritually like I really didn't expect

374.759 --> 381.0
it to be like that it was it was

378.199 --> 381.0
genuinely

386.759 --> 392.599
interesting right so the yeah movie

390.199 --> 396.84000000000003
soless I watched

392.599 --> 401.4
that uh other than that didn't continue

396.84 --> 404.11999999999995

um oh Benjamin was there also that was

418.8 --> 421.52000000000004

465.319 --> 470.47900000000004
like stream from last night didn't watch

468.12 --> 472.919
it last night because it was way too

470.479 --> 475.36
late from space

472.919 --> 481.44
audits channel that was recommended to

475.36 --> 483.759
me yesterday but it it was not super

481.44 --> 487.199
interesting it's really about going

483.759 --> 489.84000000000003
through the conceptions of ether and

487.199 --> 489.84000000000003
melon

493.199 --> 496.879
Morley lots of

495.199 --> 499.91900000000004
misconceptions that are being

496.879 --> 499.91900000000004
presupposed in

503.68 --> 510.24
that ROM of conscious video from

506.479 --> 512.88
yesterday was really interesting

510.24 --> 515.88
about

512.88 --> 515.88
nii

519.44 --> 525.7600000000001
hilarious like what a strange figure

521.839 --> 525.7600000000001
that was very

526.88 --> 532.32
strange but the Matt made some good

529.32 --> 532.32
points

545.63 --> 548.6899999999999
[Music]

550.0 --> 553.2
yeah and that was it sort

553.24 --> 557.88
of watch a couple of videos watch the

562.04 --> 568.3199999999999
movie that's chicken broccoli dinner

565.399 --> 570.24
that was really very welcome I think

568.32 --> 572.399
it's like the butter I needed a little

570.24 --> 574.04
bit more butter so yeah but I'm having

572.399 --> 577.6
dinner

574.04 --> 579.92
today with a lot of butter in it part of

577.6 --> 582.5600000000001
the gravy so I'm looking forward to

579.92 --> 585.56
that seems to be doing a lot of good for

582.56 --> 585.56
me

612.0 --> 620.839
right so yeah I'm uh up for talking

616.0 --> 620.839
about whatever you guys like

631.28 --> 634.3399999999999
[Music]

655.48 --> 660.76
also some minor developments with the

658.24 --> 665.16
whole GTI

660.76 --> 668.079
thing cuz like yeah that did

665.16 --> 670.959
collapse like the cryptocurrency that it

668.079 --> 673.1999999999999
was based off because like the financial

670.959 --> 676.5189999999999
situation in the world is just like not

673.2 --> 678.9200000000001
accommodating for it and it's

676.519 --> 681.88
required and

678.92 --> 684.16
uh but there's been some new Dynamics to

681.88 --> 686.399
it so it's like it's kind of switching

684.16 --> 690.24
to Bitcoin in

686.399 --> 692.839
ways and well

690.24 --> 694.16
that's now rolling a bit so who knows

692.839 --> 697.399
where that'll

694.16 --> 700.639
go but it's not going to like go

697.399 --> 703.44
anywhere in a big hurry

700.639 --> 705.36
though but who knows there's like just a

703.44 --> 709.2
little another

705.36 --> 715.12
little spark of hope for the future

709.2 --> 715.12
there and we'll see where that ends up

720.58 --> 723.619
[Music]

724.959 --> 729.6389999999999
but yeah it seems like they're kind of

726.92 --> 729.639
switching to

730.48 --> 736.6800000000001
bitcoin and I mean like yeah in the

734.12 --> 741.639
current situation with El

736.68 --> 741.6389999999999
Salvador switching to bitcoin

744.8 --> 749.079
default a cat

759.48 --> 763.88
like yeah with the El Salvador switching

761.6 --> 765.72
to bitcoin there should be at least more

763.88 --> 768.72
stability for

765.72 --> 768.72
it

769.72 --> 775.6
like and I mean it's still like not like

773.16 --> 777.7199999999999
worth investing all your money in ETC

775.6 --> 781.12
and I don't have any money really to

777.72 --> 781.12
invest in it any

781.68 --> 785.8
anyway concerned about just

786.399 --> 793.0
my availability of

789.36 --> 794.6800000000001
food but yeah that's just like slowly

793.0 --> 797.519
now rolling in the background and we'll

794.68 --> 797.519
see where that ends

798.68 --> 802.68
up uh

849.199 --> 854.399
more government hassle I mean are the

852.12 --> 857.36
people that are in

854.399 --> 861.04
this the missionary cabinet here are

857.36 --> 861.04
just like absolutely

861.36 --> 866.6800000000001
terrible what what the hell are you

864.36 --> 871.04

866.68 --> 871.04
about how the hell is that funny

874.24 --> 880.12
it's not even my cat like don't be it's

880.48 --> 883.48
ridiculous

892.12 --> 897.759
ah right but I mean these ministers here

895.079 --> 901.04
they're they're so terrible they really

897.759 --> 901.04
are absolutely

901.36 --> 908.9590000000001
horrendous and they just obstruct any

905.24 --> 912.6
positive development any resistance

908.959 --> 915.04
against World economic Forum type

912.6 --> 918.8000000000001
agendas that are being imposed through

915.04 --> 922.639
Europe and all that and we

918.8 --> 925.279
can the country can do something against

922.639 --> 928.0790000000001
it basically brace against it and they

925.279 --> 932.4399999999999
just they don't they just get in the way

928.079 --> 932.4399999999999
of that it's it it is like

955.12 --> 960.68
treachery cat seem no you don't know

958.12 --> 963.519

970.56 --> 975.7199999999999
food it's the only damn thing he ever

973.319 --> 978.279
cares about and that's why he comes here

975.72 --> 981.88
cuz he's just like obsessed with hoping

978.279 --> 984.92
to get food and he does that

981.88 --> 990.04
continually the cat doesn't give a [Â __Â ]

984.92 --> 990.04
about anybody only about food only

995.72 --> 1003.9200000000001
what this good okay

999.079 --> 1003.92
Moxy well I'm glad you're feeling good I

1004.16 --> 1009.24
guess like what

1006.639 --> 1012.92
agendas

1009.24 --> 1016.48
yeah the nitrogen

1012.92 --> 1020.4799999999999
agenda that like Farmers

1016.48 --> 1024.319
can't basically like they have manure

1020.48 --> 1027.3600000000001
access in accordance to how it's set and

1024.319 --> 1030.319
like it's just creating giant problems

1027.36 --> 1034.1989999999998
like completely unnecessary

1030.319 --> 1039.799
problems in the nitrogen agenda that

1034.199 --> 1041.88
supposedly a pollutant like CO2 is is an

1039.799 --> 1047.319
Abomination that

1041.88 --> 1050.1200000000001
is just a a blatant attack on

1047.319 --> 1051.84
Farming and thereby food availability

1050.12 --> 1054.28
here in the Netherlands I mean that is

1051.84 --> 1057.1599999999999
what it is it's the only thing it is and

1054.28 --> 1057.16
it should be

1057.24 --> 1060.8700000000001
absolutely annihilated it should be

1059.52 --> 1062.039
halted in the tracks

1060.87 --> 1064.08
[Applause]

1062.039 --> 1067.12
and if

1064.08 --> 1070.12
possible like prevent it from ever

1067.12 --> 1070.12
happening like that

1072.72 --> 1078.6000000000001
again but yeah it's still ongoing so

1076.36 --> 1081.08
yeah that's that's a thing that's still

1078.6 --> 1081.08
on I'm

1088.89 --> 1092.009

it's

1113.96 --> 1120.799
all directly tied into climate change

1117.64 --> 1120.7990000000002
agenda which

1121.2 --> 1127.72
is directly tied in with the WF that's

1125.2 --> 1127.72
just what it

1137.08 --> 1142.799
is what

1139.6 --> 1142.799

1227.28 --> 1233.1589999999999
all complicated set but I mean they are

1230.2 --> 1235.72
like pretty blatantly conspiring to do

1233.159 --> 1239.24
that and have been doing that

1235.72 --> 1239.24
for a long

1248.159 --> 1254.7600000000002

aiz yeah climate change is complete

1282.559 --> 1287.44
fabrication there's no evidence to back

1284.96 --> 1289.44
it it's based on models that have been

1287.44 --> 1293.159
debunked

1289.44 --> 1295.96
thoroughly there's never been a single

1293.159 --> 1298.24
climate change related prediction that

1295.96 --> 1302.3600000000001
has ever come true in the history of

1298.24 --> 1306.159
mankind not a single prediction

1302.36 --> 1308.9189999999999
ever yeah there been harping on this

1306.159 --> 1308.919
type of

1309.36 --> 1316.9599999999998
nonsense climate cataclysm because of

1313.159 --> 1319.24
man influence since the 19th century it

1316.96 --> 1322.52
is completely

1319.24 --> 1326.919
bunk every time and that's why they keep

1322.52 --> 1326.9189999999999
reshaping the nonsense claims about

1373.88 --> 1380.159
lifetime yeah there's been

1376.52 --> 1386.24
geoengineering in your lifetime

1380.159 --> 1389.5200000000002
yeah is it is not due to any standard

1386.24 --> 1393.32
industrial or generally human activities

1389.52 --> 1393.32
that the climate has changed at

1393.72 --> 1398.919
all

1396.039 --> 1402.6
right especially not in the ways that

1398.919 --> 1407.679
are predicted there been no temperature

1402.6 --> 1407.6789999999999
average change total nonsense

1412.76 --> 1418.52
I mean there's been some aberant weather

1414.679 --> 1420.2
but I mean yeah there's been like

1418.52 --> 1423.559
obvious

1420.2 --> 1426.2
climate interventions man-made climate

1423.559 --> 1428.799
interventions that yeah geoengineering

1426.2 --> 1428.799
that's been

1433.24 --> 1440.88
there oh you didn't see snow for years

1437.12 --> 1443.9189999999999
yeah well that not man-made that's that

1440.88 --> 1446.3200000000002
just happens it's called warm periods

1443.919 --> 1446.3200000000002
cold

1447.32 --> 1452.72
periods and they do not relate to human

1453.32 --> 1461.12
activities yeah the climate changes all

1458.08 --> 1464.52
by itself completely irrespective of

1461.12 --> 1464.52
human activity

1479.44 --> 1486.159
we differ no it it's fine it just means

1483.159 --> 1488.679
you're really [Â __Â ] stupid

1486.159 --> 1491.7600000000002
the anybody who believes in climate

1488.679 --> 1494.1200000000001
change is a numpty [Â __Â ] I'm sorry to

1491.76 --> 1496.12
tell you there's no evidence for it

1494.12 --> 1499.12
whatsoever it's a complete communist

1496.12 --> 1499.12
agenda

1500.48 --> 1506.24
it's an agenda to imprison human

1503.159 --> 1508.96
activity it's Neo

1506.24 --> 1511.159
feudalism and it blames us for all kinds

1508.96 --> 1514.799
of things that cannot be proven to be

1511.159 --> 1514.7990000000002
caused by human activity at

1516.72 --> 1522.32
all yeah and most of the predictions are

1519.64 --> 1522.3200000000002
complete

1523.6 --> 1527.32
nonsense yeah you know what causes

1525.919 --> 1529.7990000000002
climate

1527.32 --> 1532.72
change climate change

1529.799 --> 1535.52
agenda building windmills

1532.72 --> 1538.3600000000001
everywhere yeah that actually causes

1535.52 --> 1541.1589999999999
climate change that actually damages

1538.36 --> 1541.1589999999999
nature

1543.559 --> 1551.039
provably yeah then you really are that's

1547.44 --> 1553.3200000000002
right correct then you really are a

1551.039 --> 1557.12
stupid numpty [Â __Â ] and a communist

1553.32 --> 1557.12
Lackey that's correct

1586.24 --> 1590.96
I know they still Force teach it yeah

1588.84 --> 1595.8799999999999
just like other things like

1590.96 --> 1597.32
transgenderism and all that [Â __Â ] yeah if

1595.88 --> 1600.96
something is real you don't have to

1597.32 --> 1605.24
force it you could just prove it and

1600.96 --> 1608.279
then convince people but people will not

1605.24 --> 1610.279
be convinced unless they're idiots that

1608.279 --> 1612.48
are easily to go along with anything

1610.279 --> 1612.48
they're

1612.6 --> 1618.76
told because there's no evidence that

1615.039 --> 1618.76
any of it is real

1627.399 --> 1631.4799999999998
so then they indoctrinate you because

1629.64 --> 1633.1200000000001
that's what they want they want you to

1631.48 --> 1635.679
believe

1633.12 --> 1638.36
that they want you to feel guilty they

1635.679 --> 1642.159
want you to feel like you're a burden on

1638.36 --> 1642.1589999999999
nature and it's absolute

1644.399 --> 1649.399
nonsense in what way do wind turbines

1647.159 --> 1651.88
contribute to climate change it damages

1649.399 --> 1651.8799999999999
nature

1655.64 --> 1662.159
orble and it actually leaves a giant

1659.0 --> 1664.32
mess it's not

1662.159 --> 1668.88
durable like even through their own

1664.32 --> 1673.48
model it basically costs more pollution

1668.88 --> 1677.2
to produce leaves more junk at the

1673.48 --> 1680.1200000000001
end then it can ever prevent it's

1677.2 --> 1680.1200000000001
infeasible

1684.559 --> 1690.6
but just through financial scamming

1687.76 --> 1695.0
basically they they try to force it

1690.6 --> 1695.0
anyway it's just an industrial

1697.96 --> 1706.32
scam at this point most green

1701.799 --> 1709.399
energy like sources that like windmill

1706.32 --> 1712.24
parks and solar power too I mean solar

1709.399 --> 1716.08
power there is something for it on a

1712.24 --> 1720.96
small scale when there's local something

1716.08 --> 1724.799
local but like as a main power source

1720.96 --> 1728.3600000000001
all of those things are completely

1724.799 --> 1731.76
dysfunctional they are provably

1728.36 --> 1736.279
dysfunctional they cost more energy to

1731.76 --> 1739.919
produce then they yield in their entire

1736.279 --> 1742.039
lifetime and they're very polluting

1739.919 --> 1745.159
especially solar panels are very

1742.039 --> 1748.96
polluting the chemicals that are used

1745.159 --> 1753.159
for that are very

1748.96 --> 1756.3600000000001
pollutant and windmills like they damage

1753.159 --> 1758.24
nature there's a lot of birds that die

1756.36 --> 1760.6399999999999
continually because of

1758.24 --> 1764.2
windmills on

1760.64 --> 1764.2
record and they

1764.76 --> 1771.76
distort the life in the ocean as well

1768.919 --> 1774.76
like I'm not going to like yeah don't

1771.76 --> 1778.44
have anything like at the ready but the

1774.76 --> 1781.679
Articles come by there's people that do

1778.44 --> 1782.88
actually catalog that the influence and

1781.679 --> 1786.1200000000001
object to

1782.88 --> 1790.24
it but the industry just keeps going and

1786.12 --> 1790.2399999999998
gets forced by the

1790.44 --> 1798.559
government instead of just having

1794.44 --> 1801.72
sensible long-term Solutions

1798.559 --> 1804.76
like having natural gas

1801.72 --> 1810.279
available or

1804.76 --> 1813.519
coal or just petrol more of

1810.279 --> 1816.44
it which are like way more

1813.519 --> 1816.44
environmentally

1816.84 --> 1822.559
friendly they are they provably are just

1820.279 --> 1825.279
when you put the numbers together they

1822.559 --> 1827.6
are more environmentally friendly than

1825.279 --> 1830.48
the supposed environmentally friendly

1827.6 --> 1832.399
durable energy which isn't durable costs

1830.48 --> 1836.84
more energy to produce than they ever

1832.399 --> 1841.36
yield and have a lot of pollution on the

1836.84 --> 1841.36
side on top of costing tons of

1842.2 --> 1848.24
money what about oone is that a story

1845.2 --> 1851.679
too yeah that's complete nonsense story

1848.24 --> 1854.84
too dupons there is no ozone

1851.679 --> 1857.3600000000001
layer that's a fictional concept there

1854.84 --> 1859.1589999999999
is no ozone layer ozone doesn't form

1857.36 --> 1865.0
layers

1859.159 --> 1865.0
yeah gas doesn't form layers at

1872.399 --> 1877.32
all what

1874.48 --> 1878.6390000000001
happens to the gases that are output

1877.32 --> 1883.559
from burning

1878.639 --> 1886.36
fuels uh well they spread around in all

1883.559 --> 1888.6
directions and then a lot of it gets

1886.36 --> 1891.76
reabsorbed at ground level

1888.6 --> 1891.76
by plant

1892.399 --> 1896.559
life yeah there's a lot of CO2 that

1894.96 --> 1903.32
comes out of it and the

1896.559 --> 1903.32
CO2 actually helps n helps nature

1907.08 --> 1913.1999999999998
provably yeah the entire supposed

1909.919 --> 1916.5590000000002
climate change movement is detrimental

1913.2 --> 1916.559
to Nature

1917.96 --> 1923.8400000000001
the premise of the climate change

1920.08 --> 1926.8799999999999
movement is provably detrimental to

1923.84 --> 1929.559
Nature it is bad for

1926.88 --> 1933.0800000000002
nature to

1929.559 --> 1937.1589999999999
deprive it from CO2 it needs it it

1933.08 --> 1937.1589999999999
absorbs it it absorbs it very

1941.039 --> 1946.84
quickly and Things become Greener

1943.44 --> 1946.8400000000001
because of it

1952.279 --> 1959.0
yeah that's why in green houses some

1955.639 --> 1960.799
green houses they actually just have

1959.0 --> 1964.159
tanks of

1960.799 --> 1967.639
CO2 that they release inside of the

1964.159 --> 1970.159
greenhouse to stimulate the plant growth

1967.639 --> 1970.1589999999999
because it

1972.799 --> 1978.96
works s by what dude get your head out

1976.32 --> 1981.519
of your ass debatable d

1978.96 --> 1985.6000000000001
stop watching nonsense

1981.519 --> 1987.72
propaganda Amazon has reduced size it's

1985.6 --> 1992.0
that they've been saying that for a

1987.72 --> 1995.519
[Â __Â ] Century debatable D it's total

1992.0 --> 1995.519
nonsense it's

1996.44 --> 2000.159
propaganda it doesn't

2006.399 --> 2009.76
happen yeah

2012.519 --> 2019.1200000000001
there's some expansion of like City area

2016.039 --> 2022.44
into the Amazon arguably a

2019.12 --> 2023.9599999999998
little but it like yeah even if they cut

2022.44 --> 2029.159
things

2023.96 --> 2030.2
down uh a lot of it just grows back it

2029.159 --> 2036.2
just

2030.2 --> 2036.2
does takes a little while but it does

2041.279 --> 2048.04
yeah and hey cities May expand yeah

2043.76 --> 2051.2
that's that's that's an issue

2048.04 --> 2054.2799999999997
perhaps but uh I mean we're not having

2051.2 --> 2056.359
trouble breathing because of it there's

2054.28 --> 2061.599
nothing we can do about it and the

2056.359 --> 2064.2799999999997
climate change agenda is definitely not

2061.599 --> 2067.3990000000003
going to change anything about that do

2064.28 --> 2069.7200000000003
you understand it only makes things

2067.399 --> 2069.72
worse

2071.24 --> 2077.3199999999997
look what happened at Dubai last week

2074.04 --> 2077.32
what the [Â __Â ] are you whining

2077.52 --> 2085.32
about that has nothing to do with

2080.0 --> 2085.32
climate change it has to do with weather

2086.56 --> 2093.48
manipulation they literally have a a

2089.119 --> 2095.8790000000004
cloud seeding system there on record AIS

2093.48 --> 2098.44
maybe you need to [Â __Â ] inform

2095.879 --> 2103.359
yourself about these things before you

2098.44 --> 2103.359
spout your nonsense claims about climate

2106.68 --> 2112.64
change wouldn't the density of the gases

2109.599 --> 2117.04
form layers no they don't they don't do

2112.64 --> 2117.04
that duper Boons they spread out in all

2119.24 --> 2125.68
directions Stop interfering and we grow

2122.32 --> 2128.2400000000002
back oh what you mean if we just kill

2125.68 --> 2131.44
every [Â __Â ] human on the Earth it will

2128.24 --> 2135.72
grow back in time oh I'm sure it will

2131.44 --> 2138.48
I'm sure it will yeah but I'm not for a

2135.72 --> 2140.9199999999996
universal human

2138.48 --> 2145.0
genocide so we're just going to have to

2140.92 --> 2148.28
deal with it the way it works and the

2145.0 --> 2152.16
ultimate problem solving

2148.28 --> 2157.2400000000002
solution the climate issues

2152.16 --> 2159.64
and nature detriments is to stop the

2157.24 --> 2163.2
[Â __Â ] climate change policies

2159.64 --> 2163.2
everywhere and forbid

2166.96 --> 2172.68
them

2168.839 --> 2175.16
yeah more CO2 is necessary it's

2172.68 --> 2177.7599999999998
necessary it's good for

2175.16 --> 2180.24
nature and what's good for nature is

2177.76 --> 2180.2400000000002
good for

2180.52 --> 2184.52
us yeah

2188.49 --> 2195.0
[Music]

2191.2 --> 2197.52
oh and need I remind you that a singular

2195.0 --> 2200.319
volcano eruption like the one that

2197.52 --> 2203.96
happened in Indonesia while

2200.319 --> 2205.2
back is like one [Â __Â ] volcano

2203.96 --> 2209.599
eruption

2205.2 --> 2213.7599999999998
produces an equivalent amount of CO2 as

2209.599 --> 2215.6800000000003
like an entire continent does in a year

2213.76 --> 2218.119
from man-made

2215.68 --> 2222.04
production there is

2218.119 --> 2227.079
absolutely nothing effective that

2222.04 --> 2230.0
you or all of humanity together could do

2227.079 --> 2230.0
to change

2231.119 --> 2236.56
anything if there was even a point to

2233.599 --> 2239.04
that and there isn't yeah you want to

2236.56 --> 2242.68
take care of the environment make sure

2239.04 --> 2245.04
that industry minimizes the amount of

2242.68 --> 2247.52
toxic

2245.04 --> 2250.4
poison things that are actually tox

2247.52 --> 2254.56
toxic that are bad for nature that

2250.4 --> 2259.04
prevent plants from growing that make

2254.56 --> 2262.88
animals and plant sick if you cut those

2259.04 --> 2266.599
down as much as you can and leave the

2262.88 --> 2269.52
CO2 gases just be what they

2266.599 --> 2272.0
are like that's better that's what we

2269.52 --> 2275.079
can do we can do good things for the

2272.0 --> 2278.599
environment we can optimize

2275.079 --> 2282.079
it climate change agenda and what they

2278.599 --> 2285.599
do trying to cut down CO2 trying to cut

2282.079 --> 2288.3590000000004
down nitrogen yeah it doesn't work it's

2285.599 --> 2288.3590000000004
only

2289.2 --> 2295.9199999999996
detrimental it's detrimental to us and

2292.599 --> 2295.92
it's detrimental to

2300.48 --> 2307.48
Nature yeah and I am an environmentalist

2303.8 --> 2309.4
I always have been I love nature and

2307.48 --> 2312.33
climate change agenda and all these

2309.4 --> 2315.57
people these scam artists is an

2312.33 --> 2315.5699999999997
[Music]

2318.4 --> 2323.48
Abomination if it be up to me and it

2320.96 --> 2326.04
isn't so don't worry about anything I'm

2323.48 --> 2330.2400000000002
about to say if it were up to me I'd

2326.04 --> 2330.24
have them all hunted down and

2330.76 --> 2337.079
executed

2332.319 --> 2339.92
yeah cuz they are evil they're exploit

2337.079 --> 2343.2400000000002
they're exploiting Humanity they're evil

2339.92 --> 2346.0
they cause more damage they cause damage

2343.24 --> 2349.0
to Nature they cause damage to the

2346.0 --> 2352.64
environment they cause damage to society

2349.0 --> 2355.119
and economy they damage and Destroy

2352.64 --> 2358.0789999999997
things it's the only thing they do and

2355.119 --> 2362.2000000000003
and end up richer in the process they're

2358.079 --> 2362.2000000000003
treasonous to humanity and

2364.599 --> 2372.119
nature electric cars don't help either

2367.8 --> 2373.3590000000004
are you [Â __Â ] aiz do you even try to

2372.119 --> 2378.88
figure things

2373.359 --> 2378.88
out yeah electric cars are not

2379.52 --> 2383.92
good they're polluting

2401.359 --> 2404.5989999999997
yeah they don't

2404.64 --> 2412.92
work electric cars like cost Rare Earth

2410.52 --> 2415.52
minerals that a lot of countries can't

2412.92 --> 2419.8
even produce

2415.52 --> 2422.52
and it causes mining for all that stuff

2419.8 --> 2425.7200000000003
causes massive environmental damage

2422.52 --> 2427.96
provably toxic environmental

2425.72 --> 2429.56
damage kills a whole whole bunch of

2427.96 --> 2432.68
people through the

2429.56 --> 2435.599
pollution and there's technically just

2432.68 --> 2435.5989999999997
not enough of

2438.04 --> 2443.68
it yeah and then you're left with like

2440.56 --> 2443.68
giant amounts of

2444.56 --> 2450.7999999999997
batteries that are literally polluting

2447.52 --> 2454.599
it's the same as with with solar panels

2450.8 --> 2456.5600000000004
they're polluting they run out of

2454.599 --> 2461.56
functionality and then they're just

2456.56 --> 2461.56
pollution the same goes for all these

2463.0 --> 2473.4
batteries yeah

2466.359 --> 2473.4
gasoline is much more efficient and less

2480.76 --> 2485.6800000000003
polluting and now electric cars can be

2484.16 --> 2489.2
kind of nice

2485.68 --> 2491.52
but to

2489.2 --> 2494.8799999999997
to think that everybody could just

2491.52 --> 2497.56
switch to electric cars is

2494.88 --> 2500.96
infeasible it's already calculated to be

2497.56 --> 2504.52
impossible you know what their solution

2500.96 --> 2506.88
is well then nobody gets to drive a car

2504.52 --> 2509.319
except for a bunch of elitist snobs that

2506.88 --> 2511.48
own everything they get to drive the

2509.319 --> 2515.079
electric car and everybody else has to

2511.48 --> 2518.88
use the bus or just go on a bicycle or

2515.079 --> 2521.2400000000002
walk yeah that's their solution you call

2518.88 --> 2521.2400000000002
that a

2522.48 --> 2525.64
solution it

2527.64 --> 2532.64
isn't solar panels polluting what do you

2530.24 --> 2535.0789999999997
mean you know like the chemicals that go

2532.64 --> 2537.48
in solar panels and your rows you don't

2535.079 --> 2537.48
seem to

2544.0 --> 2550.24
know maybe you should look into like the

2547.44 --> 2553.839
chemical processes that go into making

2550.24 --> 2558.0
solar panels you'll be

2553.839 --> 2558.0
shocked extremely

2559.52 --> 2564.24
toxic like actually bad for the

2565.359 --> 2568.839
environment unlike

2570.16 --> 2575.2799999999997
CO2 right and again I'm not against

2572.96 --> 2579.119
solar panels entirely they can have a

2575.28 --> 2582.76
very good function in a small scale and

2579.119 --> 2586.2400000000002
local you can't just use it on a massive

2582.76 --> 2592.3190000000004
scale for a standard power

2586.24 --> 2594.7599999999998
supply yeah I mean there's just in

2592.319 --> 2599.7599999999998
China they've cut

2594.76 --> 2604.8
down like hundreds of Acres of Ancient

2599.76 --> 2609.8390000000004
Forest to install a bunch of solar

2604.8 --> 2609.8390000000004
panels yeah you think that's good for

2614.28 --> 2619.599
nature it isn't it literally destroys

2629.24 --> 2633.68

because it's getting

3693.4 --> 3698.92
subsidized that's the only reason it is

3696.0 --> 3702.28
more cheap because it's getting

3698.92 --> 3704.599
subsidized through the same [Â __Â ]

3702.28 --> 3706.96
environmentalist scamming

3704.599 --> 3712.799
organizations yeah the banks are

3706.96 --> 3712.799
imposing this on us they're forcing it

3732.119 --> 3735.799
a moment

3744.839 --> 3748.88
yeah for

3787.319 --> 3794.119
yeah that's right

3790.16 --> 3794.1189999999997
greo because it's a

3795.559 --> 3800.2400000000002
scam it's an

3797.839 --> 3803.5589999999997
indoctrination

3800.24 --> 3807.279
scam Bankers impose the fake

3803.559 --> 3810.079
environmentalism on everybody

3807.279 --> 3812.559
they can just take it all away all that

3810.079 --> 3816.3590000000004
subsidies just like oh oh we're not

3812.559 --> 3819.039
going to subsidize it anymore oh oh the

3816.359 --> 3820.5589999999997
Alternatives the original gasoline cars

3819.039 --> 3823.2000000000003
are now

3820.559 --> 3825.8390000000004
forbidden you thought oh well if the

3823.2 --> 3827.68
electric cars are so cheap well yeah we

3825.839 --> 3831.4
don't really need the gasoline cars

3827.68 --> 3833.72
we'll just let the politician ban those

3831.4 --> 3836.039
and then oh oh the subsidies are gone oh

3833.72 --> 3837.319
now you have to use those [Â __Â ] El El

3836.039 --> 3840.92
cars and they're

3837.319 --> 3844.119
totally unreasonably expensive and

3840.92 --> 3846.839
electricity payments are off the chart

3844.119 --> 3850.1600000000003
so you literally can't actually even use

3846.839 --> 3851.5589999999997
it feasibly and you can't even get a

3850.16 --> 3854.64
gasoline car

3851.559 --> 3857.599
anymore yeah that's the

3854.64 --> 3861.0389999999998
scam I mean people have talked about

3857.599 --> 3861.039
this 10 years

3861.079 --> 3867.52
ago how this scam works it's been out

3865.16 --> 3869.3999999999996
there for forever it's known what

3867.52 --> 3875.16
they're

3869.4 --> 3880.319
doing isn't gas line flamable yeah you

3875.16 --> 3880.319
think so what it's super

3884.24 --> 3889.4799999999996
efficient

3886.64 --> 3894.1189999999997
yeah and you don't run out of

3889.48 --> 3896.799
it compared to battery fluid which over

3894.119 --> 3899.48
time degrades and

3896.799 --> 3902.88
then then you can't use it anymore you

3899.48 --> 3902.88
just have this chemical

3905.52 --> 3913.279
waste right and even to mine all that

3909.48 --> 3915.839
stuff for the batteries is like a huge

3913.279 --> 3918.279
destruction of nature every time where

3915.839 --> 3921.44
they start mining that it destroys the

3918.279 --> 3924.64
nature it pollutes

3921.44 --> 3929.4
everything yeah and the people that work

3924.64 --> 3929.4
there they often die from Health

3930.76 --> 3937.92
complications like that's already

3933.4 --> 3937.92
happening right now it's already

3939.4 --> 3947.839
known yeah gasoline is very

3944.079 --> 3950.6800000000003
efficient it's become very

3947.839 --> 3953.52
developed and yeah there are some

3950.68 --> 3956.0389999999998
environmental detriments to that as well

3953.52 --> 3959.599
but it is more efficient

3956.039 --> 3962.279
and it doesn't leave giant amounts of

3959.599 --> 3966.279
really toxic pollution it doesn't

3962.279 --> 3966.279
destroy nature as much to get

3968.599 --> 3977.4
it yeah that's right oil is infinite it

3972.16 --> 3982.0789999999997
is it replenishes oil reserves

3977.4 --> 3984.76
replenish oil wells fill up again it's

3982.079 --> 3988.3590000000004
known it's a known fact that they do

3984.76 --> 3993.1600000000003
that you're not going to run out

3988.359 --> 3993.16
yeah but you are going to run out of

3994.4 --> 4002.76
batteries and besides what are you going

3996.799 --> 4005.44
to charge the damn batteries with yeah

4002.76 --> 4011.2400000000002
the amount of energy it requires to

4005.44 --> 4014.4
charge a battery like that is way more

4011.24 --> 4017.52
than the amount of energy to just use

4014.4 --> 4020.92
gasoline yeah you need to burn more

4017.52 --> 4023.52
gasoline to power an electric generator

4020.92 --> 4027.0
to fill your car

4023.52 --> 4031.44
battery than it would when you just use

4027.0 --> 4031.44
gasoline in your car that's a

4031.559 --> 4036.3590000000004
fact yeah so where you going to get that

4033.92 --> 4038.2000000000003
power from with your with your battery

4036.359 --> 4043.5989999999997
car yeah it's still going to have to be

4038.2 --> 4043.5989999999997
produced somehow it's all a scam

4048.76 --> 4052.6800000000003
okay you're out of here

4090.119 --> 4096.0
what about electricity generated by

4092.559 --> 4100.92
nuclear power plants nuclear

4096.0 --> 4103.52
fion yeah well it could work I mean

4100.92 --> 4106.799
nuclear power is very efficient I'm all

4103.52 --> 4106.799000000001
for it

4110.159 --> 4114.3189999999995
right but I mean they're shutting down

4112.199 --> 4117.839
nuclear plants as

4114.319 --> 4121.319
well I don't know if you're aware of

4117.839 --> 4127.04
that yeah same fake environmentalist

4121.319 --> 4127.04
also shut down nuclear power

4127.33 --> 4130.51
[Music]

4133.08 --> 4140.159
yeah was asking me to come back the

4136.12 --> 4140.159
other day what other day are you talking

4150.719 --> 4155.319
about all right anyway I'm going to get

4153.199 --> 4158.3189999999995
my Illuminati C and coffee I'll be right

4155.319 --> 4158.319

no equal e equal does not equal mcÂ² it's

4380.56 --> 4384.92
absolute nonsense it doesn't even mean

4383.0 --> 4391.28
anything

4384.92 --> 4394.2390000000005
yeah nuclear power is just rocks heating

4391.28 --> 4398.04
water driving a

4394.239 --> 4399.799999999999
turbine do I SP still speak to Riley no

4398.04 --> 4405.08
I haven't talked to him in

4399.8 --> 4405.08
ages don't know what the hell he's up to

4408.199 --> 4413.32
I mean I have him on Skype but he

4410.32 --> 4413.32
doesn't respond to

4432.52 --> 4437.4400000000005

4467.12 --> 4470.8
people out because I don't like the

4469.32 --> 4473.599999999999
attitude

4470.8 --> 4479.1990000000005

4487.32 --> 4492.639
just hanging around here polluting

4490.679 --> 4495.639
everything with your ill-informed

4492.639 --> 4495.639
garbage

4506.36 --> 4512.28
yeah you're not going to be here talking

4508.239 --> 4512.28
[Â __Â ] about people from the Flat Earth

4512.52 --> 4516.92
debates you got it

4528.32 --> 4534.719
no I do not agree that atom splitting

4531.56 --> 4534.719
produces energy of

4541.04 --> 4547.6
heat that's just a concept I I don't

4544.48 --> 4552.0
know that that is happening at

4547.6 --> 4553.639
all all I know is that uranium in a

4552.0 --> 4557.92
concentrated

4553.639 --> 4559.96
form r rates heat for a very long

4557.92 --> 4564.04
time very

4559.96 --> 4565.8
long and that that heats water that then

4564.04 --> 4568.12
drives a turbine and that's how a

4565.8 --> 4571.6
nuclear plant works and that's the

4568.12 --> 4575.159
extent of what I'm willing to accept as

4571.6 --> 4577.639
fact yeah as to your theory as to how

4575.159 --> 4580.638999999999
that's happening I don't believe any of

4577.639 --> 4580.639
that

4587.11 --> 4590.29
[Music]

4596.36 --> 4602.5599999999995

4599.4 --> 4606.48
need you to watch you see I don't need

4602.56 --> 4609.679

4672.6 --> 4676.8
currently and that's it

4680.96 --> 4684.2390000000005
do I have a theory on what causes the

4682.92 --> 4687.2390000000005
energy to

4684.239 --> 4687.239
reproduced

4696.96 --> 4703.88
no do I count as an fed panelist no I

4701.04 --> 4707.76
don't I'm not on fed anymore you might

4703.88 --> 4707.76
have noticed for

4757.92 --> 4760.4800000000005
not know

4761.679 --> 4769.4
that he my bell must be uncomfortable

4766.28 --> 4769.4
I don't know it's

4771.159 --> 4776.44
doable especially if you have no choice

4796.44 --> 4801.36
I don't yeah now you're getting a

4799.12 --> 4805.44
timeout 30

4801.36 --> 4809.96

4805.44 --> 4809.96
in the rules read the description

4813.639 --> 4819.639

4848.88 --> 4854.96
them all day long I have no problem my

4851.56 --> 4856.8
chat being almost not active cuz I'd

4854.96 --> 4859.159
rather have moments where there's

4856.8 --> 4861.52
literally nobody saying anything for 10

4859.159 --> 4866.0
minutes than having to watch a bunch of

4861.52 --> 4869.92
Dumpty dip shits talk absolute hor [Â __Â ]

4866.0 --> 4869.92
continually in my chat you got

4873.08 --> 4879.4
it have no objection just kicking all of

4876.32 --> 4879.4
you out just like

4883.199 --> 4890.96
that do I get recognized in

4886.639 --> 4890.96
public uh

4891.239 --> 4897.12
yeah but there's not that many Dutch

4894.239 --> 4902.0
people like in the city that watch my

4897.12 --> 4902.0
show but yeah I do get recognized in

4905.159 --> 4910.32
public okay there we go

4915.12 --> 4921.159
yeah yeah that's not the type of

4916.88 --> 4921.159000000001
questions that I I find

4928.76 --> 4934.719
acceptable do I even look in a mirror

4932.0 --> 4936.679
and do the de no I don't have to look in

4934.719 --> 4939.36
the

4936.679 --> 4941.639
mirror to do that yeah I do the

4939.36 --> 4944.759999999999
technique the mirror has nothing to do

4941.639 --> 4944.76
with it

4961.6 --> 4967.04
right yeah g Buel I

4963.719 --> 4969.639
know it's the

4967.04 --> 4973.28
model that we

4969.639 --> 4976.4400000000005
get that concerns radioactivity as they

4973.28 --> 4976.44
call it

4976.719 --> 4981.4800000000005
I don't trust

4978.639 --> 4984.36
it the more I've learned the more I

4981.48 --> 4986.199
realize that a lot of things that we

4984.36 --> 4990.719
just take for granted that we get taught

4986.199 --> 4990.719
about it it's not trustworthy at

4992.719 --> 5000.12
all if I were applying it what are you

4996.44 --> 5000.12
talking about Toral

5001.88 --> 5007.88
tragedy looking at yourself has no

5005.12 --> 5011.8
influence whatsoever when it comes to

5007.88 --> 5016.32
the technique having your eyes open has

5011.8 --> 5020.1990000000005
is m is really only distracting it

5016.32 --> 5023.0
distracts from applying the

5020.199 --> 5027.96
technique

5023.0 --> 5030.8
yeah visual gaze has no positive

5027.96 --> 5030.8
influence

5032.84 --> 5038.400000000001
whatsoever when it comes to applying the

5034.96 --> 5038.4
technique so just

5038.6 --> 5046.08
stop right but anyway Greg runel

5043.44 --> 5050.08
yeah nuclear

5046.08 --> 5052.5199999999995
material like

5050.08 --> 5056.36
uranium what is known is that if you

5052.52 --> 5058.88
concentrate it it Heats its

5056.36 --> 5062.5599999999995
environment it heats water that's how

5058.88 --> 5064.84
they are using it in nuclear power

5062.56 --> 5068.360000000001
plants that part I trust

5064.84 --> 5070.28
it actually works that does work but

5068.36 --> 5072.5199999999995
then there's a gigantic amount of

5070.28 --> 5074.719
nonsense misinformation that surrounds

5072.52 --> 5078.1990000000005
all of all of

5074.719 --> 5081.719
it the dangers of

5078.199 --> 5083.638999999999
radioactivity is extremely

5081.719 --> 5086.119
exaggerated I don't think there's any

5083.639 --> 5088.719
dangers at all but hey I'm not a nuclear

5086.119 --> 5090.32
physicist so I'm not indoctrinated with

5088.719 --> 5093.119
the propaganda that

5090.32 --> 5097.759999999999
is accepted as

5093.119 --> 5097.759999999999
standard right so it's none of my

5102.0 --> 5111.199
business oh oh aiz oh I'll see you in 30

5107.56 --> 5111.1990000000005
minutes I warned

5121.239 --> 5126.32
you yeah Atomic weapons total nonsense

5129.4 --> 5135.96
does enriched mean the same as

5131.28 --> 5135.96
concentrated yeah pretty much

5158.28 --> 5162.28
right I'm going to take a bite of my

5159.56 --> 5164.04
Illuminati C and hopefully it'll calm

5162.28 --> 5166.36
down a

5164.04 --> 5168.719
bit guys are certainly getting on my

5166.36 --> 5168.719
nerves

5168.92 --> 5173.84
today but I

5170.679 --> 5177.639
mean there's very few things I find more

5173.84 --> 5179.76
tedious than to deal with severely

5177.639 --> 5183.400000000001
indoctrinated people especially when

5179.76 --> 5183.400000000001
they form groups

5184.48 --> 5189.919999999999
can't stand

5186.36 --> 5192.36
it what technique the

5189.92 --> 5194.4800000000005
technique it's something I

5192.36 --> 5198.679
do it's like a

5194.48 --> 5201.44
prayer it's a remote healing prayer

5198.679 --> 5206.159
technique it's based I learned it from

5201.44 --> 5206.159
my healer based on Rudolph Steiner

5207.48 --> 5216.119
lore and it works and if you don't

5212.0 --> 5219.08
believe in it I don't give a [Â __Â ]

5216.119 --> 5222.719
cuz I do it and it

5219.08 --> 5228.0
works and that's all I care

5222.719 --> 5228.0
about and has no name I just call it the

5229.159 --> 5235.44
technique hey thank Phil good to see

5233.119 --> 5239.4
you all right anyway I'm going to take a

5235.44 --> 5239.4
bite out of this one cheers

5255.08 --> 5258.96
no Greg R so there's no

5260.56 --> 5267.4800000000005
relation between how a nuclear power

5263.28 --> 5272.92
plant generates energy compared to an

5267.48 --> 5272.919999999999
alleged atomic bomb energy release

5278.44 --> 5281.799999999999
are you banned again

5281.84 --> 5286.360000000001
no I could though I could ban you

5289.52 --> 5293.280000000001
again that's what you're here

5295.6 --> 5301.4800000000005
for no not Bruno

steinhoff

5301.48 --> 5305.48
Rudolf Steiner

5315.39 --> 5318.479
[Music]

5339.119 --> 5343.4
why because you're asking for

5350.04 --> 5357.119
it cuz I'm kind of agitated from the the

5355.119 --> 5360.239
nonsense in chat so

5357.119 --> 5363.08
far and if you're going to contribute to

5360.239 --> 5364.678999999999
the nonsense behavior in chat then yeah

5363.08 --> 5367.76
I will

5364.679 --> 5367.76
it's up to you Steven

5370.36 --> 5376.199
Jarvis do I guys have a bunch of

5373.08 --> 5376.199
windmills there

5376.8 --> 5383.320000000001
yeah and they

5379.56 --> 5383.320000000001
suck and they kill

5387.08 --> 5396.04
wildlife and they literally like they

5390.32 --> 5396.04
even have a de from what I heard a detr

5396.4 --> 5402.759999999999
influence on the wellbe of farm animals

5399.679 --> 5405.28
the sound they make they negatively

5402.76 --> 5407.76
influence milk production there's all

5405.28 --> 5412.28
kinds of detriments they kill

5407.76 --> 5415.84
birds they negatively influence other

5412.28 --> 5418.599999999999
animals yeah windmills are

5415.84 --> 5420.32
terrible they don't actually produce

5418.6 --> 5423.1990000000005
stable

5420.32 --> 5425.679
energy and eventually they break down

5423.199 --> 5430.879999999999
and then you're left with giant amounts

5425.679 --> 5432.92
of material that's non recyclable

5430.88 --> 5435.400000000001
non-recyclable that just has to be

5432.92 --> 5438.679
buried in a landfill somewhere yeah it's

5435.4 --> 5441.679
already been happening windmills are

5438.679 --> 5441.679
horrendously

5445.0 --> 5452.119
polluting yes step Jarvis I know I'm a

5448.92 --> 5454.88
little bit touchy take it

5452.119 --> 5457.08
easy look at the chat

5454.88 --> 5460.719
and realize like

5457.08 --> 5463.28
hey Arwin might be a little bit uh

5460.719 --> 5465.679
little bit ban happppy right now just

5463.28 --> 5465.679
take it

5480.04 --> 5485.92
easy so I'm kind of a wizard yep

5492.84 --> 5500.159000000001
that's right Greg Brunel told you like

5496.56 --> 5501.84
I'm not just making this stuff up I pick

5500.159 --> 5507.08
up on these

5501.84 --> 5507.08
things like through media through social

5508.04 --> 5514.6
media I mean this kind of stuff is like

5510.88 --> 5516.92
I've been in alternative media

5514.6 --> 5519.52
since like

5516.92 --> 5522.679
2006 and I've followed that kind of

5519.52 --> 5525.159000000001
thing studies alternative studies people

5522.679 --> 5529.159
that figure out about fake

5525.159 --> 5529.159
environmentalism for over a

5531.0 --> 5538.48
decade I remember these things I

5534.6 --> 5541.320000000001
know what is what I know the negative

5538.48 --> 5544.759999999999
influences that they don't want to talk

5541.32 --> 5548.32
about yeah that's why the title for

5544.76 --> 5551.4400000000005
today is fake environmentalism pollutes

5548.32 --> 5555.44
and destroys nature strangles Humanity

5551.44 --> 5555.44
cuz that is what it is

5593.16 --> 5596.3589999999995
[Music]

5617.56 --> 5621.639
nonsense like the rest of the chat

5630.28 --> 5637.8
here now it seems like it's a little

5633.199 --> 5637.799999999999
under control by now that's good

5668.36 --> 5672.04

any reason to believe to be banned then

5734.36 --> 5739.759999999999
why are you entering my chat saying am I

5736.8 --> 5739.76
banned again that's

5743.6 --> 5749.280000000001
ridiculous yeah that makes me suspicious

5747.04 --> 5750.96
that you're in a trollish mood or

5749.28 --> 5753.159
something or you're going to go along

5750.96 --> 5755.639
with the trend of the rest of the people

5753.159 --> 5755.638999999999
in chat

5756.159 --> 5760.48

again might me the keyword I don't know

5816.719 --> 5819.4
what you're talking

5837.0 --> 5843.08
about there's no reason for Steven

5839.6 --> 5845.4800000000005
Jarvis to start out in my chat saying am

5843.08 --> 5848.32
I BN again there was no reason

5845.48 --> 5849.239
whatsoever for him to do that that made

5848.32 --> 5853.719
it

5849.239 --> 5853.718999999999
suspicious and that's it

5887.08 --> 5892.48
the Illuminati cound certainly hit the

5889.159 --> 5892.48
spot it's

5898.28 --> 5903.5199999999995

5983.32 --> 5986.54
[Music]

5988.239 --> 5992.598999999999

kick them out though I'm used to this

5992.599 --> 5999.08
nonsense these nonsense comes in

5996.32 --> 6001.36
waves then I have to time out and ban a

5999.08 --> 6004.5199999999995
bunch of people and then things go back

6001.36 --> 6009.5599999999995
to normal so I'm I'm okay with it I've

more

6070.0 --> 6076.04
comfortable also to be able to endure

6072.8 --> 6078.88
just the annoying trolling and the waves

6076.04 --> 6078.88
of ignorant

6079.92 --> 6085.2390000000005
people that try to force themselves in

6431.88 --> 6436.159000000001

of your comment just

6436.159 --> 6442.0
stop yeah I don't want your goofy [Â __Â ]

6438.92 --> 6443.719

6442.0 --> 6448.719
so I'm just going to ababor the chat

6443.719 --> 6448.719
with nonsense yeah that's not

6462.48 --> 6468.678999999999
acceptable don't say nonsense or you're

6465.159 --> 6468.679
going to get a timeout

6477.159 --> 6480.36
right so yeah any

6480.52 --> 6486.4400000000005
more anything else you want to know that

6484.199 --> 6488.719
that relates to the subject at hand

6486.44 --> 6490.759999999999
today fake environmentalism and how it

6488.719 --> 6493.32
pollutes and destroys nature and

6490.76 --> 6493.320000000001
strangles

6494.159 --> 6501.759999999999
humanity is it the real hym who is who

6499.199 --> 6505.759999999999
the real who who are you talking about g

6501.76 --> 6505.76
h for

6532.92 --> 6535.92
m

6552.58 --> 6555.649
[Music]

6579.719 --> 6586.4
okay

6582.36 --> 6588.08
D you mean debatable D could you spell

6586.4 --> 6592.759999999999
it out

6588.08 --> 6596.8
please could you make some effort to

6592.76 --> 6596.8
properly communicate

6601.679 --> 6606.1990000000005
perhaps is it the real himy

6606.48 --> 6613.08
yeah I don't see why it wouldn't be the

6609.719 --> 6616.28
real him there's no sock account of him

6613.08 --> 6618.92
he talks like him why the hell would you

6616.28 --> 6621.679
think it isn't

6618.92 --> 6624.639
him police engine fire it sounded like a

6621.679 --> 6624.639
fire car

6635.32 --> 6638.84
fire truck but

6644.679 --> 6648.679
uh right

6654.86 --> 6658.0199999999995
[Music]

6660.88 --> 6666.96
so what my country and other countries

6664.32 --> 6669.96
arguably every country really

6666.96 --> 6669.96
needs

6670.44 --> 6680.04
is stopping of the the

6676.239 --> 6684.5599999999995
dismantling of the CO2 carbon credit

6680.04 --> 6684.56
system like a complete dismantling

6684.599 --> 6691.159000000001
and making it illegal to do

6688.52 --> 6693.96
that that's what needs to happen needs

6691.159 --> 6693.96
to be made

6699.119 --> 6702.92
illegal so

6701.32 --> 6707.4
that

6702.92 --> 6712.88
basically the real trade

6707.4 --> 6712.879999999999
becomes just resources and labor

6713.48 --> 6718.44
but I mean yeah the banking system right

6715.52 --> 6720.8
I mean the the core of this entire

6718.44 --> 6724.4
problem with the fake environmentalism

6720.8 --> 6727.079000000001
is the utter Corruption of

6724.4 --> 6730.159
the banking system out

6727.079 --> 6734.44
there not just one bank it's like all of

6730.159 --> 6738.159
them they're all playing along with it

6734.44 --> 6738.159
and that needs to end

6740.66 --> 6747.92
[Music]

6743.44 --> 6747.919999999999
so that there can just be proper

6748.0 --> 6754.36
business proper environmental

6750.4 --> 6756.96
regulations that don't just strangle

6754.36 --> 6760.839999999999
society which is what current fake

6756.96 --> 6763.719
environmentalism does it's strangles

6760.84 --> 6765.56
society and it damages nature in the

6763.719 --> 6770.2390000000005
process as

6765.56 --> 6770.2390000000005
well and it needs to end

6778.679 --> 6786.28
yeah I mean the whole CO2 scam it

6782.32 --> 6788.96
doesn't even effectively lead to forests

6786.28 --> 6792.759999999999
being planted which was kind of an

6788.96 --> 6795.199
original premise is that oh you can like

6792.76 --> 6797.8
get discount by basically planting

6795.199 --> 6801.919999999999
forests that will then absorb the CO2

6797.8 --> 6804.360000000001
etc etc well that kind of worked for a

6801.92 --> 6808.4
while and until they decided like not to

6804.36 --> 6811.28
do that anymore and rather like just

6808.4 --> 6813.199
absorb CO2 from the air and then store

6811.28 --> 6817.32
it in

6813.199 --> 6817.32
tanks which is completely

6819.28 --> 6824.48
insane cuz that way the environment

6822.44 --> 6828.239
isn't actually

6824.48 --> 6831.718999999999
helped the air quality will not go up

6828.239 --> 6836.28
that way at all it will be a direct

6831.719 --> 6836.28
provable detriment to Nature that

6838.199 --> 6843.199
way

6840.4 --> 6845.04
so the environmentalism has just gone

6843.199 --> 6847.839999999999
out of control

6845.04 --> 6851.04
it's it should no longer be entertained

6847.84 --> 6851.04
at all it should be made

6859.96 --> 6863.96
illegal yeah

6866.32 --> 6871.5199999999995
and it can be made illegal you can do

6875.56 --> 6881.88
that but in order to do

6878.56 --> 6884.4400000000005
that you need to get banking under

6881.88 --> 6884.4400000000005
control

6889.119 --> 6895.44
again because banking are just

6892.84 --> 6895.4400000000005
they're out of

6895.48 --> 6902.119
control banking is not is not

6899.56 --> 6904.92
functioning like a service to a nation

6902.119 --> 6904.92
and Humanity

6906.159 --> 6912.92
anymore through imposed regul regulatory

6910.04 --> 6914.76
systems that are based on this fake

6912.92 --> 6916.92
environmentalism like it's not

6914.76 --> 6919.76
functioning the way it should be anymore

6916.92 --> 6925.84
and it should be

6919.76 --> 6925.84
restored to the old format of

6927.96 --> 6933.639
banking so that business can just happen

6931.32 --> 6937.799999999999
again

6933.639 --> 6937.8
and it will be better for

6938.0 --> 6946.239
nature it really will

6942.32 --> 6950.719
right stop cutting

6946.239 --> 6953.239
out like durable

6950.719 --> 6955.28
resources like natural natural

6953.239 --> 6958.4
gas and

6955.28 --> 6962.92
oil stop cutting them out stop trying to

6958.4 --> 6966.679
get rid of them use them again make the

6962.92 --> 6969.52
systems to use them even more efficient

6966.679 --> 6972.719
so you could just like do longer with

6969.52 --> 6975.88
it have it be even more clean and all of

6972.719 --> 6980.0
it is already pretty damn clean by

6975.88 --> 6982.76
now improve upon what you already have

6980.0 --> 6985.52
what we have been using and what is

6982.76 --> 6989.52
clearly shown to be like infinite

6985.52 --> 6992.360000000001
resources like oil is an

6989.52 --> 6995.96
infinite resource

6992.36 --> 6999.48
infinite infinite

6995.96 --> 7002.36
resource it's not going to run out

6999.48 --> 7003.159
cannot be proven to run out it doesn't

7002.36 --> 7005.5599999999995
run

7003.159 --> 7009.48
out yeah a natural

7005.56 --> 7013.8
gas yeah that might theoretically run

7009.48 --> 7016.48
out but there is G gantic amounts of it

7013.8 --> 7016.4800000000005
present in the

7017.44 --> 7022.5599999999995
world and it's not going to run out for

7019.8 --> 7022.56
a long

7023.079 --> 7027.679
time and it's actually quite

7025.56 --> 7032.320000000001
environmentally friendly as

7027.679 --> 7036.52
well to use it it's like the least

7032.32 --> 7040.159
polluting uh combustible

7036.52 --> 7043.280000000001
resource it's naturally very

7040.159 --> 7046.44
clean and it should be

7043.28 --> 7050.48
utilized to fix everything if everything

7046.44 --> 7052.159
is fixed then things work better and

7050.48 --> 7055.079
then there's less pollution when

7052.159 --> 7056.679
everything is fixed is when there is the

7055.079 --> 7058.92
least

7056.679 --> 7064.1990000000005
pollution yeah things that are like

7058.92 --> 7064.1990000000005
broken and dysfunctional are more

7069.079 --> 7074.32
polluting but gas isn't well I don't

7073.199 --> 7079.96
know

7074.32 --> 7079.96
maybe maybe natural gas is potentially

7083.079 --> 7089.5199999999995
infinite can't really be sure look we

7086.32 --> 7091.44
know oil wells fill themselves back up

7089.52 --> 7093.119000000001
you don't really know about gas pockets

7091.44 --> 7096.199
all that

7093.119 --> 7100.44
certain but they could as well they

7096.199 --> 7102.799999999999
could as well also be refilling

7100.44 --> 7104.598999999999
themselves it's not really relevant

7102.8 --> 7108.2390000000005
what's really relevant is that there's

7104.599 --> 7109.76
just so much of it that it wouldn't even

7108.239 --> 7113.079
matter whether they are going to run out

7109.76 --> 7116.079000000001
or not there's just so much of it it's

7113.079 --> 7116.079
crazy not to use

7116.119 --> 7121.719
it right and a lot of these gas Pockets

7118.88 --> 7123.92
like if you don't use them eventually

7121.719 --> 7126.8
they're just going to escape into the

7123.92 --> 7128.88
air raw like one earthquake and just

7126.8 --> 7131.4400000000005
poof Giant Gas

7128.88 --> 7134.4400000000005
bubble just goes out in the air with all

7131.44 --> 7136.759999999999
the toxin that may still be dissolved in

7134.44 --> 7139.28
it could that actually creates

7136.76 --> 7140.56
environmental disasters like kills like

7139.28 --> 7145.239
a whole bunch of

7140.56 --> 7145.2390000000005
life because suddenly toxic gas gets

7145.599 --> 7150.4800000000005
released after like an earthquake right

7148.52 --> 7152.52
so it's

7150.48 --> 7156.718999999999
better to

7152.52 --> 7158.280000000001
just use it utilize it then cleans up

7156.719 --> 7162.199
and then you have a

7158.28 --> 7164.0
resource that is very cheap and very

7162.199 --> 7165.079
environmentally friendly compared to

7164.0 --> 7167.56
other

7165.079 --> 7170.92
combustibles so just use it whether it

7167.56 --> 7170.92
runs out or not do

7170.96 --> 7177.44
it how deep does the ground I you know

7174.48 --> 7177.44
is it infinite

7177.92 --> 7185.28
no definitely not

7181.0 --> 7185.28
infinite but it's going to be deeper

7185.48 --> 7190.199
than than Humanity can handle let's just

7188.44 --> 7192.839999999999
say it like

7190.199 --> 7196.44
that it's going to be way way deeper

7192.84 --> 7199.079
than people could ever deal

7196.44 --> 7200.96
with like even in our most

7199.079 --> 7203.759999999999
technologically advanced State it's

7200.96 --> 7206.96
going to be way too deep for for us to

7203.76 --> 7206.96
ever do anything with

7219.159 --> 7223.4
it so yeah that should be done Resto

7221.96 --> 7225.4800000000005
store oil

7223.4 --> 7230.0
production make

7225.48 --> 7232.36
it just environmentally effective maybe

7230.0 --> 7235.36
even try to find a way to get the oil

7232.36 --> 7237.36
refining process even more

7235.36 --> 7240.079
environmentally

7237.36 --> 7242.36
friendly which is a difficult task

7240.079 --> 7245.92
because there are like

7242.36 --> 7249.199
chemicals that happen because of oil

7245.92 --> 7253.0
refining that are polluting it it

7249.199 --> 7255.159
happens it's a problem but I'm sure like

7253.0 --> 7258.4
really Advanced chemists are working on

7255.159 --> 7260.199
that they should cuz it is like a

7258.4 --> 7264.48
compounding problem that's been out

7260.199 --> 7264.48
there for like over a hundred

7264.52 --> 7269.599
years and who knows maybe there will be

7267.28 --> 7273.4
a solution to that

7269.599 --> 7275.679
eventually but the resource is just it's

7273.4 --> 7277.92
necessary because if everything grinds

7275.679 --> 7281.4
to a halt because there's no energy

7277.92 --> 7284.96
production that's going to be way more

7281.4 --> 7288.32
disast ous to Nature than if we just

7284.96 --> 7288.32
continue oil

7293.239 --> 7302.839999999999
production mil thick who knows how thick

7296.92 --> 7307.2390000000005
it is g h it could be a thousand miles

7302.84 --> 7309.719
thick don't know can't get

7307.239 --> 7313.48
there if you just look at how deep the

7309.719 --> 7317.36
Mariana Trench is well then you get a

7313.48 --> 7319.919999999999
first glimpse of how deep it could

7317.36 --> 7322.598999999999
be

7319.92 --> 7328.0
with that potentially just being a

7322.599 --> 7328.0
fragment of the toal total depth

7334.0 --> 7340.0
so

7336.88 --> 7343.84
yeah to restore the environment oil

7340.0 --> 7343.84
production should be booted back up

7343.88 --> 7350.159000000001
and worked on industrially to get it

7347.079 --> 7350.159
more environmentally

7352.239 --> 7355.879999999999
friendly hey techical soap friend let's

7354.76 --> 7360.04
see

7355.88 --> 7363.32
you and yeah gas natural gas production

7360.04 --> 7367.92
should also be definitely

7363.32 --> 7367.92
used wherever it is

7372.4 --> 7380.32
also I think that solar energy as a

7376.88 --> 7383.4400000000005
non industrial pillar should also

7380.32 --> 7385.639
continue developing

7383.44 --> 7390.119
because solar

7385.639 --> 7393.2390000000005
energy could potentially become decently

7390.119 --> 7395.88
effective as a side energy

7393.239 --> 7398.44
production that is just not as

7395.88 --> 7400.76
environmentally unfriendly not as

7398.44 --> 7403.598999999999
polluting and that would be

7400.76 --> 7406.719
good would be good to just have local

7403.599 --> 7408.4800000000005
solar energy that isn't like a detriment

7406.719 --> 7414.84
to

7408.48 --> 7416.36
Nature right but it should never be that

7414.84 --> 7418.92
like

7416.36 --> 7421.799999999999
just giant

7418.92 --> 7424.92
surfaces of forest or whatever should be

7421.8 --> 7428.119000000001
cut down just so that there's a giant

7424.92 --> 7430.88
solar panel Farm there for

7428.119 --> 7434.28
supposed permanent electricity Supply

7430.88 --> 7437.559
because that is a just a

7434.28 --> 7439.0
horrendous form of environmental abuse

7437.559 --> 7441.96
for

7439.0 --> 7443.76
a for energy production that's not that

7441.96 --> 7447.84
good at

7443.76 --> 7449.92
all yeah you could spare all that force

7447.84 --> 7452.92
from being destroyed and all the species

7449.92 --> 7455.2390000000005
that will die out because of that by

7452.92 --> 7460.599
simply

7455.239 --> 7460.598999999999
having an oilbased power plant

7464.719 --> 7472.159
pretty much one power station like that

7468.04 --> 7474.719
or let's just say a nuclear power plant

7472.159 --> 7476.92
would spare you the destruction of a

7474.719 --> 7479.719
giant

7476.92 --> 7482.28
forest and all the species that are in

7479.719 --> 7487.32
it so

7482.28 --> 7489.8
yeah oil production should re

7487.32 --> 7492.28
re-engage natural gas should be

7489.8 --> 7496.04
exploited to the maximum Poss posibility

7492.28 --> 7499.8
it is one of the best options to use

7496.04 --> 7501.639
definitely and nuclear power you have

7499.8 --> 7505.400000000001
those

7501.639 --> 7505.400000000001
three everything will be

7508.159 --> 7514.0
fine right just stop building power like

7511.32 --> 7516.639
nuclear power plants on fault lines that

7514.0 --> 7518.159
that is like that that's stupid idiotic

7516.639 --> 7522.119
Trend needs to

7518.159 --> 7523.44
end I don't know why industrialist keep

7522.119 --> 7529.199
doing that it

7523.44 --> 7529.199
is just asinine that they keep doing

7530.28 --> 7533.34
[Music]

7549.28 --> 7555.559
that c Earth

7552.719 --> 7557.52
the corner at the end of my

7555.559 --> 7560.4400000000005
what don't know what the hell you're

7557.52 --> 7560.4400000000005
talking about g

7560.679 --> 7569.32
h the Earth is flat it's not a cube it

7565.48 --> 7569.32
like the Earth surface doesn't have

7569.559 --> 7575.04
corners but the confine that we are in

7573.599 --> 7578.28
may be

7575.04 --> 7578.28
squared it

7579.28 --> 7585.079
might it might be a square and

7585.28 --> 7593.119
looping or it might be much bigger and

7589.88 --> 7596.719
looping could be all kinds of things we

7593.119 --> 7598.839999999999
don't know for certain we'd have to like

7596.719 --> 7603.079
definitively figure

7598.84 --> 7605.719
out the orientation of the equator line

7603.079 --> 7605.719
on the Earth's

7605.92 --> 7613.679
surface and then you could basically

7610.159 --> 7617.5199999999995
establish the remaining possibilities of

7613.679 --> 7617.52
what the Earth is like

7646.0 --> 7648.36
hello

7659.28 --> 7664.44
clear where can I find out more about

7661.96 --> 7664.44
infinite

7664.96 --> 7670.36
oil oil wells refill themselves

7672.679 --> 7680.2390000000005
just Google that oil wells refill

7676.679 --> 7680.2390000000005
themselves I mean you're going to get

7681.48 --> 7687.48
results and I'm sure it's going to be

7683.639 --> 7689.8
riddled with nonsense skeptic commentary

7687.48 --> 7692.598999999999
alongside that but there's plenty of

7689.8 --> 7696.52
people that report like oh yeah this oil

7692.599 --> 7700.2390000000005
well we it was abandoned like 40 years

7696.52 --> 7703.88
ago cuz it didn't yield anymore oh we

7700.239 --> 7708.0
tested it again oh it's like filled up

7703.88 --> 7711.119
again let's turn it back on like there's

7708.0 --> 7713.079
stories like that all over the place all

7711.119 --> 7716.96
over the

7713.079 --> 7716.96
world oil doesn't run

7727.0 --> 7732.52
out what Earth is flat hey did you not

7730.52 --> 7736.159000000001
read the title of the

7732.52 --> 7740.2390000000005
show hi my Baldi it's called The Flat

7736.159 --> 7740.239
Earth early bird show yeah Earth is

7757.239 --> 7761.48
flat G today

7763.119 --> 7769.96
Gary shut the [Â __Â ]

7765.76 --> 7769.96
up I talked to him over

7771.44 --> 7776.598999999999
Skype I don't have to apologize to

7781.4 --> 7787.119
anybody yeah do that again and I'll

7784.4 --> 7787.119
[Â __Â ] ban

7790.32 --> 7794.36
you for

7823.65 --> 7826.75
[Music]

7827.199 --> 7831.0
yeah you don't talk to me like

7831.8 --> 7838.360000000001
that yeah and I know Richard G for a

7835.079 --> 7840.159
very long time by now talk to him

7838.36 --> 7841.759999999999
privately on

7840.159 --> 7844.679
Skype

7841.76 --> 7848.679
yeah I'll worry about my

7844.679 --> 7848.679
friends okay

7854.719 --> 7864.719
did I apologize no I did

7858.48 --> 7864.718999999999
not no he actually apologized to me for

7865.92 --> 7868.92
overreacting

7876.599 --> 7882.4400000000005
yeah great show as always okay thanks

7879.44 --> 7882.44
Frank

7883.0 --> 7886.36
don't forget to Rogan it up if you

7884.719 --> 7891.719
really mean

7886.36 --> 7891.719
it I mean I am doing my best here

7894.25 --> 7897.35
[Music]

7920.239 --> 7924.598999999999
okay Gage I have no idea who you're

7922.239 --> 7924.598999999999
talking

7932.199 --> 7936.159
about are you talking about

7937.079 --> 7942.159
me I hope not for your sake

7944.8 --> 7948.84
you don't know if you can Rog well

7946.639 --> 7952.36
that's not my [Â __Â ] problem then then

7948.84 --> 7952.360000000001
don't you just piss off

7953.199 --> 7960.159
then yeah I do time out to keep order

7958.119 --> 7963.04
especially when you start saying things

7960.159 --> 7966.4
that I don't want you to talk about when

7963.04 --> 7968.84
you get personal and an inappropriate

7966.4 --> 7973.119
moment what makes the earth flat the

7968.84 --> 7973.119000000001
lack of sphericity the lack of curve

7976.84 --> 7980.639
no what no gas

7993.239 --> 8000.079
AG you said poor Kitty that it yeah yeah

7996.76 --> 8000.079000000001
that's annoying

8022.48 --> 8026.558999999999
have I measured the entire Earth I don't

8024.28 --> 8032.8
need to measure the entire

8026.559 --> 8035.320000000001
Earth yeah it's not a sphere it's flat

8032.8 --> 8037.719
yeah Black Swan observation proves that

8035.32 --> 8039.239
the Earth is not the sphere that it

8037.719 --> 8044.4
requires to be in order for your

8039.239 --> 8047.5199999999995
heliocentric model to work out it's

8044.4 --> 8051.0
flat I wasn't talking about well maybe

8047.52 --> 8053.679
gas H you could be a little bit more

8051.0 --> 8057.32
specific in when you say things like

8053.679 --> 8059.0
that then as in like the name of who

8057.32 --> 8062.44
you're talking

8059.0 --> 8064.199
about instead of just generically

8062.44 --> 8067.678999999999
criticizing

8064.199 --> 8067.678999999999
somebody in my

8073.079 --> 8079.679
chat Earth is the entire Earth not part

8076.92 --> 8084.84
of it oh really

8079.679 --> 8087.4
so what parts of the sphere are

8084.84 --> 8088.76
flat and where where does the curve

8087.4 --> 8091.679
actually start

8088.76 --> 8093.599
then I don't think you really seem to

8091.679 --> 8095.92
understand like the consequences of a

8093.599 --> 8098.32
spherical

8095.92 --> 8101.32
geometry

8098.32 --> 8101.32
Baldi

8115.0 --> 8122.4
yeah watch two my very oldest shows on

8117.8 --> 8122.400000000001
my channel okay cool guys Gage

8131.88 --> 8138.32
depends on the size of Earth no no it

8135.119 --> 8141.079
doesn't and that's you're just red

8138.32 --> 8144.239
hairing it away there's a very specific

8141.079 --> 8147.0
size of Earth that is claimed that is

8144.239 --> 8148.48
required in order for the heliocentric

8147.0 --> 8151.88
claims to hold

8148.48 --> 8155.919999999999
up it can't be bigger or

8151.88 --> 8157.28
smaller otherwise the amount of degrees

8155.92 --> 8161.599
per

8157.28 --> 8161.599
distance right it doesn't work out

8167.8 --> 8172.76
then one of them said yeah the Dark

8170.199 --> 8172.759999999999
World

8179.599 --> 8185.52
yeah say 20 in that

8182.52 --> 8185.52
video

8197.8 --> 8202.559
Whatever refraction oh really what is

8200.559 --> 8206.639
that what is

8202.559 --> 8210.16
refraction the bending of light in a

8206.639 --> 8215.179999999998
circle that's definitely not what light

8210.16 --> 8217.119999999999
does even in Optics there is no such a

8215.18 --> 8220.599
[Music]

8217.12 --> 8222.639000000001
thing yeah Gary Effy I heard you yeah it

8220.599 --> 8224.960000000001
doesn't relate to anything I'm talking

8222.639 --> 8228.96
about why are you bringing this up are

8224.96 --> 8228.96
you just trying to piss me off on

8233.599 --> 8242.04
purpose post at rationalization there

8237.2 --> 8246.2
must be one fix what

8242.04 --> 8248.479000000001
oh whatever it could be whatever man big

8246.2 --> 8251.08
small but it's a sphere

8248.479 --> 8254.119999999999
though you're

8251.08 --> 8257.399
nuts no light does not

8254.12 --> 8261.04
bend it changes

8257.399 --> 8261.039999999999
angle it doesn't

8261.559 --> 8268.92
Bend yeah terrestrial refraction

8265.08 --> 8272.84
supposedly is not Optics it's math and

8268.92 --> 8272.84
it's math that presupposes

8274.639 --> 8281.16
sphericity light doesn't

8278.0 --> 8285.479
Bend that's a

8281.16 --> 8288.479
lie yeah it changes angle refraction is

8285.479 --> 8289.84
the changing of angles look up I don't

8288.479 --> 8294.24
have to look it

8289.84 --> 8298.0
up I've heard and dealt with it hundreds

8294.24 --> 8301.28
of times hundreds of times yeah

8298.0 --> 8305.559
atmospheric refraction is a

8301.28 --> 8308.599
mathematical construct that is not a

8305.559 --> 8308.599
part of

8310.719 --> 8317.518999999998
Optics it's nonoptical

8313.96 --> 8320.559
in other words it doesn't exist it's a

8317.519 --> 8322.12
mathematical construct that presupposes

8320.559 --> 8325.08
Earth's

8322.12 --> 8328.439
sphericity that's terrestrial refraction

8325.08 --> 8331.92
or atmospheric refraction yeah light

8328.439 --> 8336.84
doesn't bend it doesn't Bend in circles

8331.92 --> 8339.519
it changes angle upon medium

8336.84 --> 8345.28
transition it doesn't

8339.519 --> 8349.12
Bend that's a lie and a mathematical

8345.28 --> 8349.12
fabrication not part of

8359.439 --> 8366.559000000001
Optics yeah I no no you're an anti flat

8363.76 --> 8370.76
earther I'm kicking you out get the [Â __Â ]

8366.559 --> 8370.759999999998
out of here you scumbag you're a

8372.04 --> 8377.599
liar normal people don't even know about

8374.92 --> 8380.519
that fabricated horse [Â __Â ] with your

8377.599 --> 8385.439
[Â __Â ] troll name

8380.519 --> 8385.439
[Â __Â ] liar lying

8387.84 --> 8393.880000000001
scumbag anti flat earther Li scumback

8398.31 --> 8401.458999999999
[Music]

8405.47 --> 8408.66
[Music]

8416.52 --> 8423.359
troll oh who got

8419.08 --> 8427.16
kicked bald D got kicked cuz he's an

8423.359 --> 8431.2
anti flat earther lying [Â __Â ]

8427.16 --> 8434.119999999999
scumbag who seems to know a lot about

8431.2 --> 8437.960000000001
terrestrial atmospheric refraction which

8434.12 --> 8439.640000000001
is a proven mathematical sphere

8437.96 --> 8443.279999999999
presupposing

8439.64 --> 8447.56
fabrication that has no relation or

8443.28 --> 8447.560000000001
evidence within the field of Optics

8448.2 --> 8456.720000000001
whatsoever yeah it's a known

8453.52 --> 8459.439
fabrication not science not

8456.72 --> 8462.199999999999
Optics if you even know about that

8459.439 --> 8466.319
you're an anti flat earther and a

8462.2 --> 8469.960000000001
liar cuz it Doesn't effectively exist it

8466.319 --> 8472.399
only exists within orographic fu-based

8469.96 --> 8474.24
math nonsense

8472.399 --> 8477.119999999999
diagrams

8474.24 --> 8483.96
yeah light doesn't

8477.12 --> 8486.880000000001
bend it changes angle up on medium

8483.96 --> 8490.72
transition that's refraction that's part

8486.88 --> 8492.839999999998
of Optics that's real that's science

8490.72 --> 8495.16
yeah

8492.84 --> 8501.28
changes

8495.16 --> 8502.84
angle it does not Bend within a nonm

8501.28 --> 8506.0
medium

8502.84 --> 8511.92
transition room it doesn't do

8506.0 --> 8511.92
that yeah it's definitely not happening

8513.88 --> 8522.279999999999
and I will not entertain anti Flat Earth

8516.359 --> 8522.28
Liars in my chat that know about these

8523.439 --> 8531.439
Fabrications yeah Earth is not a

8527.92 --> 8532.68
sphere the Earth were a sphere of the

8531.439 --> 8536.12
claimed

8532.68 --> 8539.12
proportions then the Horizon should

8536.12 --> 8541.08
always be at all times at a very

8539.12 --> 8543.52
specific set distance

8541.08 --> 8546.359
and then you wouldn't be able to see

8543.52 --> 8548.76
anything beyond that set distance no

8546.359 --> 8552.04
matter the circumstance because it would

8548.76 --> 8555.56
be physically obstructing the things

8552.04 --> 8558.04
Beyond it like a hill obstructing what

8555.56 --> 8562.0
is behind the

8558.04 --> 8565.399000000001
hill it doesn't do that there's

8562.0 --> 8567.64
observations at very low observation

8565.399 --> 8571.399
height above sea

8567.64 --> 8573.119999999999
level that yield incredible far distant

8571.399 --> 8576.08
SES

8573.12 --> 8581.720000000001
miles miles

8576.08 --> 8585.359
away yeah why because the Earth isn't

8581.72 --> 8588.279999999999
curved and the far distance sides aren't

8585.359 --> 8593.640000000001
being obstructed by the

8588.28 --> 8593.640000000001
curvature Earth is not that sphere it's

8599.0 --> 8603.76
flat yeah black x one is what that's

8608.96 --> 8614.599999999999
called light doesn't travel at all

8611.72 --> 8614.599999999999
because it yeah

8619.03 --> 8622.2
[Music]

8628.72 --> 8633.72
instantaneous manifest travel I might

8631.76 --> 8638.76
have said travel who

8633.72 --> 8638.76
cares don't nitpick me on that hor [Â __Â ]

8643.0 --> 8649.04
Frank I suppose it's really because the

8646.56 --> 8650.399
looping realm thing is not normal Flat

8649.04 --> 8653.960000000001
Earth

8650.399 --> 8657.599999999999
theory not normal what do you mean not

8653.96 --> 8657.599999999999
normal it's it's

8658.96 --> 8664.8
spatial so it can bend if it does has

8662.56 --> 8667.319
that's a total straw man Frank it has

8664.8 --> 8670.039999999999
nothing to [Â __Â ] do with whether light

8667.319 --> 8672.08
travels or is

8670.04 --> 8676.439
instantaneous

8672.08 --> 8676.439
yeah has nothing to do with

8677.0 --> 8686.24
that we're talking about

8680.52 --> 8688.319000000001
Optics yeah light doesn't Bend in its

8686.24 --> 8691.0
pathway in its

8688.319 --> 8693.199999999999
manifestation within a homo genius

8691.0 --> 8696.8
medium it never does

8693.2 --> 8700.68
that it's not how light behaves yeah

8696.8 --> 8705.358999999999
refraction is the changing of the

8700.68 --> 8708.880000000001
angle with a medium transition it

8705.359 --> 8711.880000000001
doesn't bend it changes angle that is

8708.88 --> 8714.199999999999
proven within Optics it's defined it's

8711.88 --> 8717.278999999999
mathematically described it's official

8714.2 --> 8720.279
that is what light does yeah it doesn't

8717.279 --> 8720.279
Bend

8720.96 --> 8726.96
and that's

8723.12 --> 8730.160000000002
final yeah and whether it has a speed or

8726.96 --> 8734.599999999999
is instantaneous has absolutely no

8730.16 --> 8734.6
relation to that fact at

8742.6 --> 8747.56
all what do they think of F I don't give

8745.52 --> 8751.12
a [Â __Â ] what they think about the looping

8747.56 --> 8753.72
realm g h

8751.12 --> 8755.960000000001
they don't care and I don't care whether

8753.72 --> 8755.96
they

8768.12 --> 8773.439
care addressed light bending in your

8770.8 --> 8776.519999999999
comments yeah and failed

8773.439 --> 8779.6
miserably light doesn't

8776.52 --> 8781.6
bend it changes angle upon medium

8779.6 --> 8784.359
transition I don't know how many times I

8781.6 --> 8789.04
need to say that because that is all it

8784.359 --> 8792.880000000001
is that is refraction changes angle upon

8789.04 --> 8795.52
medium transition that is it that is

8792.88 --> 8798.839999999998
refraction that's the only

8795.52 --> 8802.399000000001
refraction it doesn't

8798.84 --> 8802.399
bend in a

8802.88 --> 8808.839999999998
homogeneous medium it doesn't do that it

8805.72 --> 8811.96
only changes angle upon medium

8808.84 --> 8814.399
transition yeah not within a non-m

8811.96 --> 8817.919999999998
medium transition it doesn't do that

8814.399 --> 8822.08
ever terrestrial refraction atmospheric

8817.92 --> 8824.479
refraction is pseudo science

8822.08 --> 8828.039999999999
geometry sphere

8824.479 --> 8833.278999999999
presupposing pseudo science nonsense not

8828.04 --> 8835.359
Optics disproven made up by

8833.279 --> 8839.68
balarts to

8835.359 --> 8841.76
justify why you don't see sphericity of

8839.68 --> 8844.52
the Earth

8841.76 --> 8849.319
yeah made up by

8844.52 --> 8849.319000000001
liars and perpetuated by

8855.38 --> 8858.509999999998
[Music]

8866.0 --> 8876.8
Liars I don't care debatable d

8871.319 --> 8876.8
gravity benl yeah just intable

8881.24 --> 8889.6
idiocy I'm going to buy a few Barron oil

8886.68 --> 8890.720000000001
wells next year no it doesn't go that

8889.6 --> 8895.16
fast

8890.72 --> 8897.399
Gary and besides they're not for sale

8895.16 --> 8899.52
dumbass what you think that the Oil

8897.399 --> 8901.039999999999
Barons are just going to sell their

8899.52 --> 8904.960000000001
Wells

8901.04 --> 8907.640000000001
they know they refill you [Â __Â ] [Â __Â ]

8904.96 --> 8911.839999999998
they've known that for hundreds of

8907.64 --> 8915.039999999999
years Oil Barons don't sell their Wells

8911.84 --> 8919.76
when they're empty because they know

8915.04 --> 8919.76
they refill you [Â __Â ]

8929.04 --> 8933.080000000002
[Â __Â ] for

8968.6 --> 8972.52
it's a pure

8970.479 --> 8978.119999999999
secret

8972.52 --> 8978.12
no it's their secret it has been their

8979.479 --> 8986.24
secret who do you think figured it out

8982.319 --> 8987.439
that that happens yeah the ones that own

8986.24 --> 8989.76
the oil

8987.439 --> 8992.08
wells and then they kept it to

8989.76 --> 8996.800000000001
themselves to create artificial

8992.08 --> 8996.8
scarcity make more money it's what they

9006.88 --> 9012.88
do infinitely looping Earth that makes

9010.72 --> 9016.08
no sense that statement whatsoever what

9012.88 --> 9019.16
the hell is infinitely

9016.08 --> 9021.359
looping it's just a spatial Loop or it

9019.16 --> 9023.479
isn't a spatial Loop there's no infinite

9021.359 --> 9027.6
looping that makes no damn

9023.479 --> 9031.96
sense there's no finite Loop and there's

9027.6 --> 9031.960000000001
no infinite Loop it Loops or it doesn't

9038.319 --> 9047.24
loop I don't care Stephen Jarvis can't

9042.04 --> 9047.240000000002
you see I'm just caught off here

9049.71 --> 9053.369999999999
[Music]

9059.92 --> 9065.76
how did I find out about this

9063.319 --> 9069.88
myself read a bunch of

9065.76 --> 9069.880000000001
Articles talk to a bunch of

9075.6 --> 9082.439
people I feel figured out oil wells

9078.96 --> 9082.438999999998
refill like 10 years

9082.76 --> 9088.439
ago I don't have any sources for you

9110.56 --> 9115.76
you thought looping realm was infinite

9113.52 --> 9118.0
yeah well you don't seem to really be

9115.76 --> 9121.0
understanding what looping even

9118.0 --> 9121.0
means

9123.6 --> 9129.359
rank no

9125.64 --> 9132.399
sources I'd have to look them up I'm

9129.359 --> 9133.6
just going by memory yeah I don't have

9132.399 --> 9137.8
your

9133.6 --> 9137.800000000001
sources you're going to have to find it

9138.16 --> 9142.359
yourself no citation

9140.359 --> 9145.279
that's right I don't have

9142.359 --> 9149.12
citations I mean you can all keep asking

9145.279 --> 9152.24
that if that is what you want leave CU I

9149.12 --> 9155.439
have no citations and I won't give you

9152.24 --> 9159.479
citations yeah I never do have you

9155.439 --> 9161.439
noticed I never do that so why do you

9159.479 --> 9162.96
[Â __Â ] keep asking

9161.439 --> 9166.08
me

9162.96 --> 9169.278999999999
don't I'm just telling you take it or

9166.08 --> 9169.279
leave it

9170.84 --> 9176.56
yeah you want to know more about it you

9173.56 --> 9180.519999999999
go Google it

9176.56 --> 9180.519999999999
then you go find

9192.2 --> 9196.960000000001
out I assume the pattern carried on

9197.6 --> 9204.76
infinitely it's it's a loop

9201.12 --> 9208.08
there is no finite or infinite to a loop

9204.76 --> 9210.76
Frank it's just looping it's spatial

9208.08 --> 9214.359
interconnection there is no finite

9210.76 --> 9219.16
nature or infinite nature to it it just

9214.359 --> 9221.76
is the loop just is or it isn't there's

9219.16 --> 9225.119999999999
no amount of times to go through the

9221.76 --> 9229.960000000001
loop because there is no Loop point it

9225.12 --> 9232.6
is all looping or it isn't all looping

9229.96 --> 9234.919999999998
it's the way space is interconnected

9232.6 --> 9238.439
there is no barrier you're going through

9234.92 --> 9240.84
there's no portal it's just looping or

9238.439 --> 9241.6
it turns out not to be looping and that

9240.84 --> 9245.24
is

9241.6 --> 9248.880000000001
it there is no infinite there is no

9245.24 --> 9252.199999999999
finite anything about it it's looping or

9248.88 --> 9252.199999999999
it's not

9264.96 --> 9271.479
yeah that's cool the bable

9267.84 --> 9275.68
D you go buy them then you go buy the

9271.479 --> 9278.0
abandoned dry Wells and maybe in the

9275.68 --> 9281.279
decade or something they will fill up

9278.0 --> 9281.279
that's cool

9300.8 --> 9308.8
your drawings confuse me yeah

9303.8 --> 9311.039999999999
yeah you can't make a model of a loop

9308.8 --> 9314.519999999999
Frank that's the problem you could

9311.04 --> 9316.560000000001
potentially animate it within a computer

9314.52 --> 9321.640000000001
animation right if you want to see a

9316.56 --> 9321.64
good animation for that then just

9321.76 --> 9324.52
what's going on

9329.439 --> 9334.479000000001
here then like check

9332.16 --> 9337.68
out free

9334.479 --> 9341.08
energy where great animations to show

9337.68 --> 9344.16
you what that's

9341.08 --> 9347.12
like yeah with a paper drawing I can

9344.16 --> 9349.359
just only show it in one way and oh it's

9347.12 --> 9351.640000000001
not perfect oh it couldn't fit in your

9349.359 --> 9354.08
little mind well that's your

9351.64 --> 9357.278999999999
problem

9354.08 --> 9360.08
yeah I mean I keep explaining it which

9357.279 --> 9363.720000000001
is the best way to do it it's explaining

9360.08 --> 9367.2
exactly what the loop means like I just

9363.72 --> 9368.519999999999
did I just explain it again over and

9367.2 --> 9371.2
over

9368.52 --> 9376.720000000001
again keep trying to make it clear what

9371.2 --> 9376.720000000001
I mean with it what it implies

9376.85 --> 9380.049
[Music]

9384.16 --> 9387.399
yeah whatever Stephen

9387.56 --> 9393.319
Jarvis it's hard yeah I bet it is

9409.68 --> 9413.880000000001
infinite stair is infinite hallways yeah

9416.08 --> 9421.08
sure what do I think about people

9418.6 --> 9423.720000000001
presenting theories with no evidence I

9421.08 --> 9423.72
don't give a

9429.319 --> 9437.319
[Â __Â ] like

9432.399 --> 9437.319
globers yeah I ignore them

9474.6 --> 9479.359
I mean if you have a problem with my

9476.64 --> 9481.64
lack of evidence of tangible evidence

9479.359 --> 9484.640000000001
for what I'm talking about well I'm

9481.64 --> 9487.8
sorry I'm really sorry I can't give you

9484.64 --> 9490.92
any tangible evidence I can just give

9487.8 --> 9492.92
you the best description that I can

9490.92 --> 9494.8
figure out to try to communicate the

9492.92 --> 9497.16
ideas and that's

9494.8 --> 9499.56
it you got

9497.16 --> 9502.0
it that's not good enough for you well

9499.56 --> 9506.76
then get the [Â __Â ] out of

9502.0 --> 9506.76
here and don't come back

9537.5 --> 9540.799
[Music]

9541.2 --> 9545.08
yeah forget it

9545.479 --> 9554.319
good cuz my looping realm concept could

9551.16 --> 9556.88
be proven it's falsifiable unlike a

9554.319 --> 9559.439
bunch of other theories like upward

9556.88 --> 9562.08
Rising Earth which is completely in

9559.439 --> 9565.52
falsifiable you can never prove or

9562.08 --> 9567.88
disprove that that is the case yeah you

9565.52 --> 9571.16
can with a looping nature to the realm

9567.88 --> 9576.039999999999
you can prove or disprove it to be the

9571.16 --> 9578.88
case by figuring out the exact spatial

9576.04 --> 9581.399000000001
orientation of the

9578.88 --> 9585.72
Equator if you can figure out that the

9581.399 --> 9591.16
equator is a straight line within ukian

9585.72 --> 9596.119999999999
space then you're presented with a

9591.16 --> 9598.16
geometric problem that basically defies

9596.12 --> 9601.240000000002
normal spatial

9598.16 --> 9603.96
awareness yeah if you move in a straight

9601.24 --> 9606.199999999999
line dead reckoning straight line and

9603.96 --> 9609.72
you end up in the place where you

9606.2 --> 9612.12
started yeah there's only one logical

9609.72 --> 9616.319
conclusion there and that is that the

9612.12 --> 9616.319000000001
space that you walked in is

9617.72 --> 9622.92
looping now if that doesn't

9620.399 --> 9626.599999999999
happen turns out the equator is not a

9622.92 --> 9630.439
straight line well then it becomes

9626.6 --> 9632.880000000001
different then maybe the Earth is a dis

9630.439 --> 9635.16
right I mean in a way I kind of hope it

9632.88 --> 9638.358999999999
is I I kind of hope it is so I don't

9635.16 --> 9641.119999999999
have to continually answer these [Â __Â ]

9638.359 --> 9643.640000000001
questions about it over and over again

9641.12 --> 9646.160000000002
the people that just they don't really

9643.64 --> 9648.68
want to know

9646.16 --> 9651.24
anyway they just want to believe it's a

9648.68 --> 9651.24
stupid

9654.8 --> 9659.679999999998
or they want just like oh I just want to

9657.359 --> 9661.76
know whether it's this or that or yeah I

9659.68 --> 9665.279
can't help

9661.76 --> 9668.359
you I just know that it might be looping

9665.279 --> 9670.880000000001
the realm might be looping and I know

9668.359 --> 9671.84
how do you figure that out whether it is

9670.88 --> 9675.16
or

9671.84 --> 9676.84
isn't all has to do with the orientation

9675.16 --> 9680.64
of the equator

9676.84 --> 9682.279
line is it a circle is it really or is

9680.64 --> 9684.319
it a straight line or is it an

9682.279 --> 9687.560000000001
incomplete circle is it an

9684.319 --> 9690.119999999999
arc then present it with another

9687.56 --> 9693.92
mystery right then there is a loop that

9690.12 --> 9696.240000000002
is non straight and it's not rectangular

9693.92 --> 9700.319
looping it's more like triangular

9696.24 --> 9703.279
looping then which is very

9700.319 --> 9705.68
weird but we don't know we don't know

9703.279 --> 9711.24
for certain because we don't know the

9705.68 --> 9711.24
exact orientation of the equator line

9711.359 --> 9716.92
I still haven't like found any really

9714.479 --> 9719.96
tangible evidence that

9716.92 --> 9722.08
suggests whether it is a dead reckoning

9719.96 --> 9726.72
straight line or a

9722.08 --> 9729.439
circle all we get to see are these map

9726.72 --> 9731.96
projections and one map projection it's

9729.439 --> 9734.64
rectangular and the other map projection

9731.96 --> 9737.8
it's circular and it just there is no

9734.64 --> 9741.479
conclusive evidence either way I just

9737.8 --> 9744.119999999999
know that if it were to be measured we

9741.479 --> 9747.679999999998
could find

9744.12 --> 9752.279
out but you'd have to not just measure a

9747.68 --> 9752.279
map You' have to actually measure it on

9754.6 --> 9759.2
Earth so either way the equator is a

9757.56 --> 9763.68
loop

9759.2 --> 9765.68
no no if it's a full circle well then

9763.68 --> 9768.76
there is no

9765.68 --> 9771.12
Loop then it's a circle within ukian

9768.76 --> 9771.12
space

9772.24 --> 9779.439
it's only when it's not a full

9775.84 --> 9783.319
circle that there may be some spal

9779.439 --> 9785.960000000001
nonlinearity happening which would be

9783.319 --> 9785.96
considered a

9793.52 --> 9798.08
loop I mean I've done shows about

9798.12 --> 9802.08
this for

9831.16 --> 9835.72
let me show you some basic

9839.16 --> 9845.92
diagrams right so for example this would

9842.6 --> 9847.56
be this is like a multiple realm system

9845.92 --> 9850.52
I'm kind of presupposing that there's

9847.56 --> 9852.84
more Realms North and South but just

9850.52 --> 9856.04
take one of these circles the equator

9852.84 --> 9860.8
line is a straight line in here and so

9856.04 --> 9860.800000000001
there's a loop east to west

9862.04 --> 9869.439
right that's how it

9864.8 --> 9874.8
interconnects but it could also be a not

9869.439 --> 9874.800000000001
straight line it could be half a

9875.399 --> 9879.96
circle and then you would get something

9877.68 --> 9879.960000000001
like

9883.279 --> 9891.960000000001
this right and then in that

9887.24 --> 9896.08
setup the Loop towards the north is

9891.96 --> 9896.08
shorter than the loop at the

9900.2 --> 9906.720000000001
South right and then of course there's

9904.24 --> 9909.039999999999
the

9906.72 --> 9911.479
complication because it's not over yet I

9909.04 --> 9914.12
mean but I mean I'm I barely have the

9911.479 --> 9917.119999999999
patience to even discuss this at this

9914.12 --> 9920.6
point I I'm not I'm just not in a great

9917.12 --> 9922.880000000001
mood today sorry guys but yeah I mean

9920.6 --> 9928.04
even if the equator is a

9922.88 --> 9928.039999999999
circle then that still leaves some

9928.2 --> 9931.92
issues like within the map projections

9930.92 --> 9934.84
that we

9931.92 --> 9938.439
know the amount of

9934.84 --> 9940.72
space that is actually in existence

9938.439 --> 9942.800000000001
within the inner

9940.72 --> 9946.199999999999
circle

9942.8 --> 9950.56
is insufficient to accommodate for what

9946.2 --> 9952.880000000001
is actually there as if is the

9950.56 --> 9957.519999999999
southern south of the

9952.88 --> 9959.839999999998
Equator the amount of available room and

9957.52 --> 9962.960000000001
space and

9959.84 --> 9968.439
distance that should be

9962.96 --> 9968.438999999998
there it's not enough it doesn't

9968.6 --> 9974.76
fit what is on the inside on north of

9971.92 --> 9976.84
the equator doesn't fit on the inner

9974.76 --> 9980.2
circle compared to what is south of the

9976.84 --> 9983.08
Equator within the map projection

9980.2 --> 9987.399000000001
of the and so there could be a weird

9983.08 --> 9987.399
nonlinear situation happening in that

9989.2 --> 9996.68
sense half a circle not flat what the

9992.24 --> 9999.68
[Â __Â ] no not curved gas

9996.68 --> 10002.319
H are you

9999.68 --> 10005.92
[Â __Â ] I'm talking about the Flat

10002.319 --> 10005.92
Earth surface and its

10006.16 --> 10012.0
orientation there is no curv

10009.439 --> 10016.52
in any of

10012.0 --> 10016.52
this no curve it's

10022.64 --> 10030.96
flat this is about how the flat

10027.12 --> 10034.160000000002
surface spatially interconnects with the

10030.96 --> 10036.199999999999
rest of the flat surface there is no

10034.16 --> 10039.319
curvature in any of this because there

10036.2 --> 10043.279
is no curvature the Earth is flat it's

10039.319 --> 10045.359
not spherical it's not curved this is

10043.279 --> 10050.640000000001
about the

10045.359 --> 10053.720000000001
available space of Flat Earth and how it

10050.64 --> 10056.319
interconnects with the rest of available

10053.72 --> 10059.96
space of Flat Earth that's what this is

10056.319 --> 10063.88
about is no sphericity they see curves

10059.96 --> 10069.199999999999
yeah in a top down view

10063.88 --> 10069.199999999999
dumbass top down View

10087.56 --> 10092.24
you think you're not getting it oh

10093.12 --> 10097.800000000001
really who could have thought

10103.68 --> 10108.479000000001
confusion Rises yeah because you can't

10106.08 --> 10111.279
see any kind of curve without thinking

10108.479 --> 10113.119999999999
oh that means I'm looking at a sphere

10111.279 --> 10116.479000000001
because you're [Â __Â ] [Â __Â ] every

10113.12 --> 10118.84
time you see a curve oh that means

10116.479 --> 10123.438999999998
spere that's

10118.84 --> 10127.279
[Â __Â ] yeah just told you it's a top

10123.439 --> 10131.800000000001
down view the diagrams are a top down

10127.279 --> 10137.479000000001
view it's not not a perspective view

10131.8 --> 10137.479
it's a top down View

10164.51 --> 10168.28
[Music]

10182.279 --> 10185.68
but top down view of the Equator would

10183.96 --> 10188.199999999999
be a circle oh

10185.68 --> 10191.68
really did you see that with your own

10188.2 --> 10193.92
eyes the bable D you seem to know like

10191.68 --> 10195.68
oh yeah of course oh yeah yeah oh really

10193.92 --> 10199.92
based on

10195.68 --> 10199.92
what it would be that oh

10200.239 --> 10203.8
really based on

10203.84 --> 10209.72
what you always do just like complete

10207.319 --> 10212.199999999999
blank assertions and just assume that

10209.72 --> 10214.64
that's true because you just came up

10212.2 --> 10218.439
with it without any references or

10214.64 --> 10218.439
sources or anything

10218.96 --> 10223.259999999998
of course it's a circle oh oh really

10221.16 --> 10224.479
based on what did you measure

10223.26 --> 10228.64
[Music]

10224.479 --> 10231.119999999999
it did you see it did you see it from

10228.64 --> 10231.119999999999
outer

10235.72 --> 10240.96
space did I not

10237.96 --> 10244.56
sleep yeah I I didn't sleep well this

10240.96 --> 10244.56
night that's correct

10255.0 --> 10260.0
hey red Sabbath I'm not talking to you

10258.239 --> 10262.6
did you catch on yet that I'm not

10260.0 --> 10262.6
talking to

10270.0 --> 10276.68
you I'm mostly talking here

10273.239 --> 10280.359
to gas H and debatable

10276.68 --> 10284.08
D yeah so you could stop being like Oh

10280.359 --> 10286.279
I'm so outraged oh this and that yeah I

10284.08 --> 10289.2
don't give a [Â __Â ] dude I don't give a

10286.279 --> 10290.960000000001
[Â __Â ] I'm not in a good mood right now

10289.2 --> 10295.239000000001
and I don't have the patience for this

10290.96 --> 10295.239
hor [Â __Â ] from you guys

10318.319 --> 10323.84
you drew a circle with a top down view

10323.96 --> 10327.319
yeah that's

10328.239 --> 10334.239
right it's a

10331.2 --> 10336.880000000001
model it's one of my models where it's

10334.239 --> 10339.479
not the Earth is not rectangular but

10336.88 --> 10341.519999999999
rather circular

10339.479 --> 10345.278999999999
circular

10341.52 --> 10347.720000000001
flat with an equator that's straight so

10345.279 --> 10351.12
that the equator length the loop at the

10347.72 --> 10354.599999999999
equator length is like longer than the

10351.12 --> 10358.2
loop north and south of it it's a model

10354.6 --> 10358.2
it's one of the models that I

10359.16 --> 10364.52
drew it's all flat top down view that's

10362.68 --> 10370.439
what it

10364.52 --> 10370.439
is yeah this that's what that is

10381.2 --> 10385.560000000001
the straa doesn't make sense for you

10383.52 --> 10387.359
okay well you don't like it well that's

10385.56 --> 10390.319
too

10387.359 --> 10395.479000000001
bad I'm not saying that it is that it's

10390.319 --> 10395.479
just a possibility of what it could be

10399.56 --> 10404.56
if the horizontal is straight then do

10402.6 --> 10407.359
the

10404.56 --> 10409.64
longitude bend on FL I don't know I'm

10407.359 --> 10409.640000000001
Not Gon

10410.239 --> 10416.319
to it's just I'm not even going to

10413.08 --> 10418.6
answer that those look like spheres yeah

10416.319 --> 10420.72
because that's all you can see isn't it

10418.6 --> 10422.800000000001
just spheres on the brain yeah you get

10420.72 --> 10424.479
to see spheres everywhere oh you see a

10422.8 --> 10427.438999999998
map you're automatically going to think

10424.479 --> 10429.479
of sphere don't you but they kind of

10427.439 --> 10430.92
look like sphere so it's must be spheres

10429.479 --> 10432.88
yeah yeah that's called

10430.92 --> 10436.960000000001
indoctrination that's called getting

10432.88 --> 10439.278999999999
raised up in your life from birth with

10436.96 --> 10440.72
spheres everything you see is a sphere

10439.279 --> 10443.960000000001
oh you look at the sun oh that's a

10440.72 --> 10446.358999999999
sphere why because you're told that's a

10443.96 --> 10448.399
sphere

10446.359 --> 10450.68
immediately that you're standing on a

10448.399 --> 10454.56
sphere you're going to have balls to

10450.68 --> 10456.880000000001
play with and marbles all kinds of

10454.56 --> 10458.439
spheres so yeah you think it's a sphere

10456.88 --> 10461.56
kind of looks like a sphere must be a

10458.439 --> 10464.04
sphere right but I just explained to you

10461.56 --> 10466.6
how it is in the sphere how what I drew

10464.04 --> 10471.359
is not a

10466.6 --> 10474.279
sphere now if you can't go by what is

10471.359 --> 10477.239
told about what you're looking at and

10474.279 --> 10479.720000000001
you have to play into your physicality

10477.239 --> 10482.359
assumption bias instincts that tells you

10479.72 --> 10485.0
it's a sphere for what you're going to

10482.359 --> 10487.800000000001
go with then you got a problem problem

10485.0 --> 10489.439
of not actually listening to what people

10487.8 --> 10492.0
tell you

10489.439 --> 10496.04
and letting your intuition dictate to

10492.0 --> 10499.96
you what you're looking at it's a very

10496.04 --> 10499.960000000001
strong physicality assumption

10500.2 --> 10504.640000000001
bias yeah not my problem if you don't

10503.359 --> 10508.04
understand what you're looking at and

10504.64 --> 10509.64
you don't listen to instructions well

10508.04 --> 10512.640000000001
yeah you're not going to figure it out

10509.64 --> 10512.64
then

10520.359 --> 10527.399000000001
why can't they see Polaris south of the

10523.92 --> 10531.0
Equator well first off you can see

10527.399 --> 10535.479
Polaris south of the Equator

10531.0 --> 10540.12
dumbass yeah just not very far south of

10535.479 --> 10543.278999999999
the Equator and besides it's

10540.12 --> 10546.08
nonlocal holographic angular

10543.279 --> 10550.52
manifestation and if you go further

10546.08 --> 10553.8
south of the Equator well it's simply

10550.52 --> 10556.800000000001
the angle goes underneath the

10553.8 --> 10556.8
Horizon

10559.08 --> 10567.16
yeah that's

10561.8 --> 10568.679999999998
it right the apparent Demis spere of the

10567.16 --> 10573.399
stars and the Sun and the Moon and

10568.68 --> 10576.720000000001
everything that's around you visually

10573.399 --> 10579.119999999999
yeah if you move a certain distance the

10576.72 --> 10581.599999999999
apparent sphere rotates

10579.12 --> 10583.479000000001
and yeah things that are kind of close

10581.6 --> 10584.800000000001
in their angle to the Horizon yeah they

10583.479 --> 10587.399
will

10584.8 --> 10590.72
disappear you just won't be able to see

10587.399 --> 10593.199999999999
them CU they go underneath the Horizon

10590.72 --> 10593.199999999999
and that's

10593.359 --> 10599.359
it yeah there is no actual distance to

10596.439 --> 10602.439
any of the Stars not

10599.359 --> 10605.720000000001
provably just change their angles and

10602.439 --> 10605.720000000001
that's it

10623.439 --> 10628.239
the cental than what

10641.04 --> 10644.720000000001
I I don't know you're asking a question

10642.92 --> 10648.0
that I I don't even understand what

10644.72 --> 10648.0
you're asking there debatable

10654.239 --> 10657.96
D and it's not

10659.04 --> 10663.52
semantics debatable D you could call

10661.279 --> 10667.52
that nitpicking it's not semantics at

10663.52 --> 10667.52
all it's quite literal

10673.12 --> 10678.640000000001
why does it go to the

10675.0 --> 10681.359
Horizon because that's what it is it's

10678.64 --> 10683.84
it angles just shifts yeah there's no

10681.359 --> 10686.640000000001
actual distance it's just an angle it's

10683.84 --> 10689.8
an angular observation you move a

10686.64 --> 10692.599999999999
certain distance the angle shifts that

10689.8 --> 10696.08
angle makes the observation of the star

10692.6 --> 10698.319
body shift underneath the Horizon then

10696.08 --> 10701.76
you don't see it anymore that's why what

10698.319 --> 10705.6
it is that's all you get yeah I can't

10701.76 --> 10709.0
tell you why I can't tell you why the

10705.6 --> 10712.0
stars work the way they do they just

10709.0 --> 10712.0
do

10712.239 --> 10716.16
yeah it's just what it

10721.359 --> 10726.92
is it's not half an explanation it's the

10724.92 --> 10730.16
only explanation it's the only

10726.92 --> 10733.64
explanation that doesn't presuppose a

10730.16 --> 10735.96
bunch of nonsense and claims an actual

10733.64 --> 10738.239
position for any of the celestial lights

10735.96 --> 10743.278999999999
which they don't

10738.239 --> 10743.279
have yeah they don't have actual

10749.319 --> 10754.64
positions so perspective does not apply

10752.399 --> 10759.439
to any of them and anybody who claims

10754.64 --> 10763.16
that is a physicality assumption bias

10759.439 --> 10765.279
enabling disc earther [Â __Â ] and

10763.16 --> 10767.16
there's a lot of them yeah you just make

10765.279 --> 10769.52
that argument oh it's perspective it's

10767.16 --> 10772.239
just moving out of whatever you you

10769.52 --> 10775.12
don't have evidence of an actual

10772.239 --> 10777.92
position you're just presupposing it it

10775.12 --> 10779.560000000001
does and then then perspective applies

10777.92 --> 10781.6
it's all nonsense you don't have

10779.56 --> 10783.88
evidence for it you don't have evidence

10781.6 --> 10786.319
for any actual position of any of the

10783.88 --> 10789.358999999999
celestial lights

10786.319 --> 10792.199999999999
ever they're only apparent that's all

10789.359 --> 10794.800000000001
you have you only have apparent angular

10792.2 --> 10797.359
positions in relation to the Observer

10794.8 --> 10801.438999999998
and how they consistantly shift as you

10797.359 --> 10804.800000000001
move over the Earth and that is it

10801.439 --> 10807.56
angular position change actual position

10804.8 --> 10811.199999999999
doesn't even come into play there is no

10807.56 --> 10811.199999999999
evidence for it

10821.6 --> 10827.92
you can complain about that debatable D

10824.12 --> 10829.12
there just isn't any answer for it it

10827.92 --> 10832.279
doesn't

10829.12 --> 10835.52
exist people can

10832.279 --> 10837.560000000001
be claiming all these things about it oh

10835.52 --> 10839.92
no it does this and that oh it's there

10837.56 --> 10842.56
and oh this is why it goes into the

10839.92 --> 10846.479
distance yeah that's all physicality

10842.56 --> 10851.479
assumption bias based presuppositional

10846.479 --> 10851.479
reasoning it's ping the gun there is no

10864.279 --> 10870.52
evidence so everyone out hey this you're

10867.76 --> 10870.52
saying that not

10876.68 --> 10883.279
me I'm scientific

10879.359 --> 10884.2
theories it's about spatial looping

10883.279 --> 10886.880000000001
there

10884.2 --> 10889.479000000001
it's there's nothing happening it's not

10886.88 --> 10892.599999999999
a scientific theory because I'm not

10889.479 --> 10895.479
proving the cause of an effect it's a

10892.6 --> 10898.56
geometry issue it's a

10895.479 --> 10901.278999999999
geometry of the available volume within

10898.56 --> 10904.16
the realm that's what the looping is

10901.279 --> 10909.84
about it's not a scientific

10904.16 --> 10909.84
theory it's a potential what is

10912.12 --> 10920.279
evidence that's it like it's an idea

10916.6 --> 10922.800000000001
about what could be geometrically it's

10920.279 --> 10926.16
not scientific never could be scientific

10922.8 --> 10929.08
just like the Earth being a sphere claim

10926.16 --> 10933.6
is not scientific even if it were to be

10929.08 --> 10938.479
true which it isn't yeah it's a geometry

10933.6 --> 10941.84
claim not a cause of an effect that is a

10938.479 --> 10944.679999999998
naturally occurring phenomenon it's not

10941.84 --> 10948.6
scientific never was never will be it's

10944.68 --> 10948.6
a geometry issue

10964.47 --> 10970.458999999999
[Music]

10974.26 --> 10982.03
[Music]

10985.01 --> 10990.53
[Music]

10994.47 --> 10997.529999999999
[Music]

11004.399 --> 11009.399
let everybody else talk hey stop a

11009.479 --> 11015.438999999998
minute excuse me what the hell are you

11013.12 --> 11015.439
talking

11020.359 --> 11026.08
about stop demanding evidence for what

11027.88 --> 11032.438999999998
and hey I

11029.56 --> 11033.76
mean I don't have to stop anything this

11032.439 --> 11037.279
is my

11033.76 --> 11041.439
show and I can treat my chat however I

11037.279 --> 11043.479000000001
damn well please so

11041.439 --> 11046.880000000001
stop

11043.479 --> 11048.399
demanding what I should be demanding or

11046.88 --> 11052.0
anything G

11048.399 --> 11055.039999999999
AG you don't have a right to say any of

11052.0 --> 11057.52
these things you don't have a right to

11055.04 --> 11060.239000000001
be here I can literally like just kick

11057.52 --> 11063.239
you out just like

11060.239 --> 11066.6
that yeah and I don't have to justify

11063.239 --> 11068.84
that I can just do that yeah because

11066.6 --> 11068.84
it's

11069.479 --> 11073.679999999998
tedious what you guys are doing is

11083.6 --> 11088.359
tedious so I could do whatever I damn

11086.319 --> 11092.399
well please and

11088.359 --> 11092.399000000001
yeah you don't have any

11095.279 --> 11102.479000000001
recourse yeah and hey if you're coming

11098.8 --> 11105.84
with a nonsense idea like terrestrial

11102.479 --> 11108.319
refraction then I can address that I can

11105.84 --> 11111.0
falsify it I can tell you exactly where

11108.319 --> 11114.88
it came from what it is and what it

11111.0 --> 11118.88
definitely isn't and I will address

11114.88 --> 11118.88
that yeah

11119.16 --> 11126.56
and I did I did not ask you for evidence

11123.52 --> 11128.800000000001
anybody in here did I ask for evidence

11126.56 --> 11133.519999999999
of terrestrial

11128.8 --> 11137.56
refraction no I didn't ask anybody for

11133.52 --> 11141.479000000001
evidence did I I don't waste my time

11137.56 --> 11145.199999999999
with asking for evidence which I know

11141.479 --> 11147.84
doesn't exist because I've been dealing

11145.2 --> 11150.239000000001
with stupid terrestrial refraction claim

11147.84 --> 11150.239
since

11150.279 --> 11158.16
2017

11153.08 --> 11160.16
2017 yes yeah seven years seven years of

11158.16 --> 11163.2
dealing with nonsense terrestrial

11160.16 --> 11166.08
refraction claims on a very regular

11163.2 --> 11168.16
basis I know every [Â __Â ] thing about

11166.08 --> 11170.279
it other than the detailed math because

11168.16 --> 11173.72
I just don't care to remember that at

11170.279 --> 11176.560000000001
all and I know ex exactly what it is and

11173.72 --> 11178.8
what it isn't I don't even need to ask

11176.56 --> 11181.96
for evidence with that I just know what

11178.8 --> 11185.56
it is and especially what it isn't and

11181.96 --> 11188.519999999999
how you can't use it as a claim within

11185.56 --> 11191.72
Optics because it isn't

11188.52 --> 11195.399000000001
Optics it's not Optics it's a

11191.72 --> 11197.278999999999
mathematical nonsense madeup

11195.399 --> 11201.599999999999
excuse to

11197.279 --> 11204.560000000001
justify why you don't see

11201.6 --> 11207.800000000001
curvature yeah why it looks so

11204.56 --> 11210.119999999999
flat yeah that's what terrestrial refra

11207.8 --> 11212.88
what standard refraction is it's not

11210.12 --> 11216.68
based in Optics it claims behavior of

11212.88 --> 11220.239
light that light does not have and I

11216.68 --> 11222.439
explain it all did I ask for evidence no

11220.239 --> 11226.359
I don't need to ask for evidence I'm

11222.439 --> 11229.239
just telling you what I know about it

11226.359 --> 11231.960000000001
yeah so don't you [Â __Â ] straw man

11229.239 --> 11234.76
project your hor [Â __Â ] about asking for

11231.96 --> 11237.278999999999
evidence and put him in my shoes because

11234.76 --> 11240.800000000001
I don't even ask you for evidence I'm

11237.279 --> 11240.800000000001
just telling you what I

11251.08 --> 11254.96
know yeah have fun I

11255.16 --> 11260.2
will bunch of Dumpty

11257.56 --> 11261.76
[Â __Â ] you're all [Â __Â ] [Â __Â ] you

11260.2 --> 11263.6
think you can beat me just because

11261.76 --> 11266.239
you're teaming up with each other bunch

11263.6 --> 11269.439
of ballards you think you can you can

11266.239 --> 11273.84
get Arwin under it I've been doing this

11269.439 --> 11276.08
for a [Â __Â ] decade guys a decade you

11273.84 --> 11280.0
think you can defeat me with your

11276.08 --> 11283.56
nonsense balard arguments you can't I'm

11280.0 --> 11285.239
a master of this crap I hate it but I'm

11283.56 --> 11288.88
a master of

11285.239 --> 11291.72
it yeah I've heard everything every

11288.88 --> 11294.599999999999
conceivable attempt from every baller

11291.72 --> 11297.72
ever there's nothing you can do you

11294.6 --> 11300.04
don't have evidence for Earth curve you

11297.72 --> 11301.358999999999
don't have evidence for the Earth being

11300.04 --> 11306.399000000001
a

11301.359 --> 11310.04
ball yeah I can pinpoint every stupid

11306.399 --> 11313.239
little rebuttal attempt every single one

11310.04 --> 11315.2
in detail as I have and I will continue

11313.239 --> 11317.279
to do so and there's nothing you can do

11315.2 --> 11319.0
to stop

11317.279 --> 11323.319000000001
me

11319.0 --> 11328.72
yeah so by all means

11323.319 --> 11328.72
leave Earth is not a ball

11328.88 --> 11335.479
it's flat and it might be

11331.56 --> 11337.88
looping depending on how the orientation

11335.479 --> 11339.92
of the equator is it will certainly give

11337.88 --> 11343.16
you a lead whether it's looping or

11339.92 --> 11345.64
whether it is a ukian disc as some of

11343.16 --> 11347.64
the circular map projections would

11345.64 --> 11350.519999999999
suggest and a lot of flat earthers

11347.64 --> 11354.76
believe but I don't think so I think

11350.52 --> 11358.800000000001
it's rectangular looping irregular

11354.76 --> 11363.319
rectangular probably I don't know for

11358.8 --> 11365.56
sure but I do know that my conception

11363.319 --> 11368.6
the geometric conception not a

11365.56 --> 11371.6
scientific claim or suggestion a

11368.6 --> 11373.720000000001
geometric conception is

11371.6 --> 11377.04
falsifiable you

11373.72 --> 11379.64
can go out in the world and figure out

11377.04 --> 11381.080000000002
whether it is true or not you can do

11379.64 --> 11383.519999999999
that it is a

11381.08 --> 11387.96
possibility and I will stick to that and

11383.52 --> 11387.960000000001
maybe one day we will find out

11406.97 --> 11410.17
[Music]

11411.64 --> 11416.92
what all right I'm rounding out the show

11443.58 --> 11446.659
[Music]

11447.04 --> 11449.239000000001
here

11474.68 --> 11479.239
was a stinker today yeah it's been tough

11481.04 --> 11486.359
I hope everybody did learn

11483.6 --> 11490.0
though hope I'm not just doing this for

11486.359 --> 11490.0
absolutely nothing

11509.439 --> 11514.12
maybe tomorrow night I'll show I don't

11511.96 --> 11515.56
know I don't know if there's going to be

11514.12 --> 11519.52
any show at this

11515.56 --> 11522.479
point I got complaints I got complaints

11519.52 --> 11525.439
for for dealing with you basically

11522.479 --> 11529.56
somebody just told me like indirectly I

11525.439 --> 11529.56
should have probably just banned you all

11531.319 --> 11536.239
immediately and I'm wondering if I

11533.439 --> 11538.16
should have I feel that maybe I should

11536.239 --> 11539.84
have not even like engaged in this

11538.16 --> 11542.8
entire conversation with you guys

11539.84 --> 11542.8
because it's just so

11566.12 --> 11569.12
tedious

11596.12 --> 11600.08
e for

11620.16 --> 11626.719
[Music]

11635.08 --> 11640.289999999999

great certainly use it right I'll be

11725.279 --> 11728.08
back tomorrow with flat Earth early word

11727.12 --> 11731.479000000001
number

11728.08 --> 11734.92
1931 on a Saturday hope to see you all
