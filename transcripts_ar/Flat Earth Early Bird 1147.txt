but it's still

117.119 --> 119.92
very windy

120.159 --> 126.68
and so there are clouds rushing by up

123.28 --> 126.68
there as well

128.0 --> 131.679
birds hanging in the wind

132.48 --> 137.2
right but some nice clear blue spots in

135.28 --> 141.959
between

137.2 --> 141.959
i went for groceries earlier today

143.44 --> 146.56
and that was kind of nice

146.959 --> 153.56
so it's not wet or anything

150.08 --> 153.56
unlike yesterday

158.8 --> 161.20000000000002
right

164.4 --> 167.519
starting a little late

168.64 --> 174.879
yeah

170.879 --> 174.879
went out for groceries had some lunch

175.2 --> 178.0
oh

176.48 --> 179.92
lunch is

178.0 --> 182.56
hitting the spot but it's

179.92 --> 184.39999999999998
a little making me a little bit tired

182.56 --> 185.519
drawing all that blood to my stomach and

184.4 --> 187.12
all that

185.519 --> 188.31900000000002

192.72 --> 196.76
people to come in my chat

270.4 --> 275.0
so i'm now getting one daily

283.84 --> 286.56
you thought you were late to the party

285.52 --> 288.15999999999997
crockett

286.56 --> 289.44
yeah well everybody seems to be a bit

288.16 --> 291.91900000000004
late

289.44 --> 296.44
i was a little bit late

291.919 --> 296.44
but no you're first in chat so

297.68 --> 300.639
very late than ever

308.8 --> 313.52000000000004
right so yeah again yesterday no flat

310.88 --> 313.52
earth debate

313.68 --> 317.84000000000003
although

315.199 --> 320.479
a little later we did have a like a long

317.84 --> 320.479
skype call

320.639 --> 325.039
where nathan talked about well non-flat

323.12 --> 327.28000000000003
earth debate related

325.039 --> 328.56
subjects

327.28 --> 332.55999999999995
that he wouldn't

328.56 --> 335.759
talk about like on the live show

332.56 --> 335.759
with like yeah

335.84 --> 341.28
medical situation out there and things

338.32 --> 344.0
that he's figured out

341.28 --> 346.0
well that i do talk about

344.0 --> 348.88
and have talked about

346.0 --> 350.96
but it was like really informative and

348.88 --> 354.639
adam was in the call as well and he laid

350.96 --> 354.63899999999995
out like a whole bunch of

354.8 --> 360.319
very keen observations about

358.0 --> 362.24
just what it's like to be a pharmacist

360.319 --> 365.28000000000003
versus a

362.24 --> 367.44
a medical doctor

365.28 --> 371.44
the protocol it was just really

367.44 --> 374.24
interesting hearing adam out on that

371.44 --> 376.16
so yeah thank you for that expose

374.24 --> 378.8
private expose though

376.16 --> 383.759
adam meekin

378.8 --> 383.759
uh let's see what else was going down

386.0 --> 392.08
watch some more own benjamin

389.12 --> 392.08
on bitchute

393.12 --> 398.0
i haven't gotten to the friday episode

395.44 --> 398.0
yet though

398.639 --> 402.28000000000003
i will get there

409.68 --> 411.73
right

410.56 --> 413.36
yeah the

411.73 --> 415.91900000000004
[Music]

413.36 --> 415.91900000000004
fed

416.8 --> 422.319
premiere was again from monday which was

419.52 --> 423.919
a really good show was it yeah it's like

422.319 --> 426.40000000000003
the second time i've heard it back now

423.919 --> 426.4
it's great

426.88 --> 432.52
so

428.56 --> 432.52
uh what else

448.72 --> 453.44000000000005
okay

451.039 --> 453.44
all right

453.919 --> 457.68
yeah

455.44 --> 461.199
i think not too many different things

457.68 --> 461.199
watch some alex jones

463.36 --> 468.08000000000004
and

465.199 --> 470.56
so did i watch a movie i think i watched

468.08 --> 472.87899999999996
a movie yesterday oh yeah

470.56 --> 475.44
sci-fi movie somebody recommended it to

472.879 --> 477.12
me yesterday or the day before i don't

475.44 --> 481.16
remember

477.12 --> 481.16
what's it called again

497.12 --> 502.8
oh yeah intersect

499.84 --> 503.75899999999996
that was a freaky movie

502.8 --> 506.319
it was

503.759 --> 507.28000000000003
very high

506.319 --> 510.08000000000004
like

507.28 --> 511.84
very condensed sci-fi

510.08 --> 514.399
and pretty much the first half of the

511.84 --> 516.159
movie was almost like non-stop techno

514.399 --> 518.8
babble

516.159 --> 521.8389999999999
it was a bunch of smurfs

518.8 --> 521.8389999999999
smurfing it

522.08 --> 527.6
and then yeah it was time-based story as

524.56 --> 529.92
it was alluded to me

527.6 --> 529.9200000000001
and

531.04 --> 537.76
i guess it was kind of interesting

534.56 --> 537.76
how they put it together

540.48 --> 546.24
but it was kind of weird though because

544.48 --> 549.04
you get yeah you start out a movie

546.24 --> 551.92
pretty much in the current days

549.04 --> 554.0
whatever that's supposed to mean

551.92 --> 554.959
where they are basically building this

554.0 --> 556.72
thing

554.959 --> 558.64
and testing it

556.72 --> 562.32
and then they're like going in a

558.64 --> 564.16
flashback to like the inventors

562.32 --> 564.9590000000001
young youth

564.16 --> 567.68
but

564.959 --> 570.2399999999999
then like wait i thought this was a

567.68 --> 571.4399999999999
flashback no it's just oh no this is the

570.24 --> 573.44
movie now

571.44 --> 576.48
you're like what

573.44 --> 578.399
if you like cut it like start watching

576.48 --> 580.5600000000001
in the middle of the movie

578.399 --> 583.839
you you wouldn't even realize like what

580.56 --> 586.56
the hell is going on here because

583.839 --> 588.32
yeah it's oh it's suddenly a completely

586.56 --> 590.88
different movie it's more about like oh

588.32 --> 593.7600000000001
a kid seeing ghosts or something it's

590.88 --> 596.64
very confusing so intersect very

593.76 --> 598.8
confusing movie

596.64 --> 598.8
but

600.0 --> 605.0
good enough i guess it was interesting

608.0 --> 613.2
right but yeah it was all it almost had

610.48 --> 614.24
like this rococo flare to it it was all

613.2 --> 616.9590000000001
a bit

614.24 --> 621.12
over the top in ways

616.959 --> 622.959
it's like some serious sci-fi nerds

621.12 --> 625.44
were basically putting this thing

622.959 --> 625.4399999999999
together

627.2 --> 629.6
anyway

629.839 --> 634.72
it was it was still interesting

632.8 --> 636.16
i think i would have to watch it again

634.72 --> 638.0
to like

636.16 --> 640.3199999999999
be able to pay more attention to the

638.0 --> 642.16
logical consistency of what they were

640.32 --> 644.24
all doing

642.16 --> 645.519
but

644.24 --> 648.32
yeah

645.519 --> 652.16
like the techno babble it it seemed kind

648.32 --> 652.1600000000001
of halfway decent it's just that

654.72 --> 657.72
like

660.16 --> 666.399
the actors were still too much of an

662.32 --> 669.2
actor like they were too much actor

666.399 --> 672.16
to really pull off the techno bevel to

669.2 --> 674.0
make it seem absolutely real

672.16 --> 677.4399999999999
that was a little bit of a problem i had

674.0 --> 680.959
i mean they were pretty they were okay

677.44 --> 682.6400000000001
the younger actors they were okay

680.959 --> 684.88
but

682.64 --> 688.64
when they did technobabble stuff it was

684.88 --> 690.56
just like no i wasn't buying it

688.64 --> 692.48
like that they were saying it i just

690.56 --> 694.2399999999999
wasn't buying it

692.48 --> 696.48
i don't know what that what the problem

694.24 --> 696.48
was

696.64 --> 701.519
but still overall i thought it was an

699.12 --> 703.76
interesting movie right

701.519 --> 707.44
hey nathan oakley

703.76 --> 707.4399999999999
jeff gas head also by the way

714.24 --> 719.44
sketch important video made to 320.

720.079 --> 722.399
okay

724.0 --> 728.36
15 minute what 215.

729.76 --> 732.639
uh what

732.959 --> 738.399
well my

734.32 --> 740.72
usual sunday and yeah my weekend shows

738.399 --> 745.12
usually last one half hour and i

740.72 --> 745.9200000000001
normally start at 2 pm so like

745.12 --> 746.88
3

745.92 --> 749.12
30

746.88 --> 751.519
is when i should be ending

749.12 --> 751.519
nathan

754.24 --> 758.0
just because i start a little late

755.76 --> 758.88
doesn't mean that i am going to continue

758.0 --> 760.639
on

758.88 --> 762.079
like i do that when you when you don't

760.639 --> 764.24
have a live show

762.079 --> 767.92
in the weekdays then

764.24 --> 770.839
i will continue on typically but

767.92 --> 775.959
in the weekend yeah there's no live

770.839 --> 775.9590000000001
show 3 30 your time yeah

791.2 --> 794.5600000000001
huh

792.24 --> 796.8
escape the pacific combat success and

794.56 --> 800.92
that's navigate that's interesting or

796.8 --> 800.92
that sounds interesting crockett

802.72 --> 806.8000000000001
what is it is it like a first person

805.04 --> 810.24
thing

806.8 --> 813.56
or is it more an adventure game style

810.24 --> 813.5600000000001
what is it

818.56 --> 823.4799999999999
all right nathan

820.16 --> 823.48
that's fine

837.12 --> 841.92
first person survival game all right

840.32 --> 845.12
well there's a lot of good engines for

841.92 --> 847.519
that these days crockett

845.12 --> 848.48
like i forgot i'm forgetting the names

847.519 --> 850.5600000000001
but

848.48 --> 852.8000000000001
there's already a couple of these games

850.56 --> 852.8
that

854.48 --> 859.1990000000001
that like make you able to

856.959 --> 861.1199999999999
build stuff

859.199 --> 863.12
like where you don't even just find

861.12 --> 865.36
weapons you can like make them for

863.12 --> 868.0
materials and all that in a first person

865.36 --> 868.0
system so

868.16 --> 872.68
yeah i guess it could be interesting

889.36 --> 895.1990000000001
it would be kind of cool though you know

891.6 --> 897.36
like technically you could have like a

895.199 --> 900.0
well just as you can have flight

897.36 --> 901.279
simulators built as realistically as

900.0 --> 904.16
possible

901.279 --> 906.72
so you could do that just with first

904.16 --> 909.279
person exploration as well and then you

906.72 --> 910.639
could like simulate the environment in

909.279 --> 912.48
the game

910.639 --> 914.9590000000001
that you could literally

912.48 --> 917.519
instead of like holding a weapon and

914.959 --> 920.4799999999999
aiming it and [ __ ] you could like have

917.519 --> 923.6
the sextant and then tune it and then

920.48 --> 925.36
actually use like a sextant simulator it

923.6 --> 928.399
shouldn't

925.36 --> 930.48
it it it can be made to be pretty damn

928.399 --> 933.519
accurate

930.48 --> 935.6
like i can easily imagine how that can

933.519 --> 937.6
be programmed

935.6 --> 938.839
it shouldn't even be that hard right and

937.6 --> 942.0
then you can

938.839 --> 946.5600000000001
like have like a

942.0 --> 950.32
a seafair exploration simulator

946.56 --> 950.3199999999999
where you literally go on a ship

951.199 --> 954.4799999999999
and there's like weather on the oceans

953.199 --> 957.12
and

954.48 --> 960.32
and then you have to just use your

957.12 --> 962.88
sextant and your compass to explore

960.32 --> 964.8000000000001
like that's technically possible i don't

962.88 --> 966.88
know if the game you're talking what

964.8 --> 969.7589999999999
you've been playing if that is like that

966.88 --> 971.6
but

969.759 --> 973.12
i mean it is technically possible to

971.6 --> 975.6
make that i don't know if it would be

973.12 --> 977.759
super interesting to play though but it

975.6 --> 981.1990000000001
would be

977.759 --> 984.24
if you're genuinely interested

981.199 --> 984.24
in how that works

993.199 --> 997.8389999999999
hey soundly's banana cam

1001.759 --> 1004.639
hey kevlar

1005.04 --> 1009.279
sorry you're like yeah everybody seems

1006.56 --> 1013.04
to be late today i don't know why

1009.279 --> 1013.04
i'm late everybody's late

1014.959 --> 1018.8
i blame nathan

1016.639 --> 1020.8
two days in a row no show

1018.8 --> 1024.279
you know and then suddenly everybody

1020.8 --> 1024.279
becomes late

1026.24 --> 1030.64
it's like the summer vacation effect

1028.319 --> 1033.839
like oh there's no more school oh okay

1030.64 --> 1035.6000000000001
then you just start like going to bed

1033.839 --> 1037.6
insanely late

1035.6 --> 1040.48
getting up in the

1037.6 --> 1045.0
early evening etc right

1040.48 --> 1045.0
that that's i blame nathan

1068.48 --> 1074.32
so check it out just okay

1071.2 --> 1074.32
okay crockett so

1076.4 --> 1081.039
was i anywhere close with my assessment

1078.559 --> 1082.72
of what that would be like is it like a

1081.039 --> 1084.32
a simulator and

1082.72 --> 1086.08
a sea

1084.32 --> 1088.32
fare

1086.08 --> 1091.1999999999998
exploration simulator is it really like

1088.32 --> 1092.799
that can you like go on a boat on the

1091.2 --> 1095.44
ocean and

1092.799 --> 1097.28
or is it still land bound i mean there

1095.44 --> 1099.679
isn't many

1097.28 --> 1101.76
first-person type games that actually

1099.679 --> 1104.0

1101.76 --> 1104.0

1718.159 --> 1725.0390000000002
did all of you like party on late

1722.159 --> 1728.0800000000002
everybody seems to be a bit slow today

1725.039 --> 1728.08
including myself

1729.039 --> 1735.48
though didn't go to bed too late

1731.84 --> 1735.48
make sure of that

1760.98 --> 1766.189
[Music]

1776.799 --> 1784.96
nice and relaxing okay good to hear

1781.12 --> 1786.32
yeah mine was pretty decent overall

1784.96 --> 1789.44
watch the

1786.32 --> 1789.4399999999998
fairly good movie

1790.08 --> 1793.08
intersect

1794.24 --> 1800.08
yeah mixed opinions about it

1798.24 --> 1802.72
but overall it was kind of worth it

1800.08 --> 1804.6399999999999
having seen it

1802.72 --> 1805.76
i might have to watch it again at some

1804.64 --> 1809.3600000000001
point

1805.76 --> 1812.24
because it was it was very confusing

1809.36 --> 1812.24
in different ways

1819.52 --> 1825.52
but yeah other than that

1821.44 --> 1825.52
i don't even remember what was i doing

1826.48 --> 1833.96
watching a bit of open benjamin here

1829.6 --> 1833.9599999999998
from alex jones there

1838.48 --> 1842.799
writing some

1839.84 --> 1845.039
comments on news articles etc that kind

1842.799 --> 1849.559
of nonsense

1845.039 --> 1849.559
constantly experimenting with that

1868.159 --> 1871.159
okay

1888.96 --> 1895.679
i you tried to watch it as well tried

1894.08 --> 1898.72
you mean intersect

1895.679 --> 1902.24
you tried to watch that

1898.72 --> 1906.159
so yeah the first part was just like a

1902.24 --> 1909.279
bunch of smurfs talking wasn't it

1906.159 --> 1913.519
i mean they were so smart oh they got it

1909.279 --> 1915.039
so well oh so brilliant special boy

1913.519 --> 1918.0
smurf

1915.039 --> 1921.48
it's all just smur yeah

1918.0 --> 1921.48
smurf socialism

1928.0 --> 1932.88
and yeah that was cut it was kind of by

1930.24 --> 1936.0
a bit like squirty it was annoying

1932.88 --> 1938.159
but yeah like after one third or half

1936.0 --> 1942.0
that completely changes

1938.159 --> 1944.72
it it all becomes really weird

1942.0 --> 1948.399
and hey that guy as a kid

1944.72 --> 1951.039
i do absolutely like resonate with

1948.399 --> 1953.12
like the way that was acted because that

1951.039 --> 1954.799
is

1953.12 --> 1958.4799999999998
in many ways

1954.799 --> 1960.8799999999999
what i felt and was like what

1958.48 --> 1963.279
my stance even was like

1960.88 --> 1964.3990000000001
so i did very much resonate with the

1963.279 --> 1967.12
character

1964.399 --> 1968.8799999999999
in his youth like including the freaking

1967.12 --> 1970.8799999999999
hallucination or well

1968.88 --> 1973.44
what he thought was a loser though it's

1970.88 --> 1975.679
all really complicated

1973.44 --> 1978.64
but yeah i very much resonated with that

1975.679 --> 1978.64
character as a kid

1979.039 --> 1982.679
very much so

1994.48 --> 1999.039
right i wish i had like a

1996.559 --> 2001.36
like some badass friend

1999.039 --> 2003.44
that would yeah that would be fearless

2001.36 --> 2004.4799999999998
like that i didn't really know anybody

2003.44 --> 2007.8400000000001
like that

2004.48 --> 2010.48
at some point i decided to become that

2007.84 --> 2010.48
to others

2012.32 --> 2016.32
but yeah that was like in my teens

2014.88 --> 2020.159
because before that

2016.32 --> 2022.799
i just i felt too weak i felt

2020.159 --> 2022.7990000000002
too alone

2024.24 --> 2029.519
but yeah as soon as like the the

2027.519 --> 2030.88
teenage hormones and all that came in

2029.519 --> 2034.96
that's when i

2030.88 --> 2034.96
i guess got more aggressive and more

2035.519 --> 2040.32
hungry for honor

2038.08 --> 2042.559
like what i'm still expressing to this

2040.32 --> 2044.399
day

2042.559 --> 2046.559
and that definitely changed me around

2044.399 --> 2049.5989999999997
made me more of a defender type and yeah

2046.559 --> 2051.679
those don't don't get targeted

2049.599 --> 2054.48
defenders don't get targeted by bullies

2051.679 --> 2056.639
they know better than that

2054.48 --> 2059.04
right

2056.639 --> 2060.879
but yeah as like a preteen i had a lot

2059.04 --> 2063.2799999999997
of issues with that

2060.879 --> 2063.2799999999997
anyway

2075.679 --> 2079.119
you couldn't make it first yeah well

2078.0 --> 2081.52
then you

2079.119 --> 2083.04
that was just pretty much all the

2081.52 --> 2085.28
smurfing

2083.04 --> 2087.7599999999998
it's like 30 minutes of smurf

2085.28 --> 2090.2400000000002
smurf technobabble and squirting over

2087.76 --> 2091.0400000000004
how incredibly smart and special they

2090.24 --> 2092.399
are

2091.04 --> 2096.72
like that [ __ ]

2092.399 --> 2096.72
and that was really annoying i agree

2097.2 --> 2102.24
but if you bear through that part and

2100.079 --> 2106.2400000000002
continue watching then it's actually

2102.24 --> 2106.24
kind of interesting and weird

2113.599 --> 2119.28
yeah yeah crockett yeah no problem

2117.2 --> 2121.359
about the link and i already passed it

2119.28 --> 2124.0
on to the guys

2121.359 --> 2124.0
on skype

2125.44 --> 2130.04
so thanks for that tip it's interesting

2140.0 --> 2146.24
right but yeah kevlar like

2143.119 --> 2148.079
i thought that even just the character

2146.24 --> 2150.3199999999997
in his youth was super interesting

2148.079 --> 2153.04
because

2150.32 --> 2154.48
that reminded me about me in so many

2153.04 --> 2155.2799999999997
different ways

2154.48 --> 2157.52
like

2155.28 --> 2160.8
that's like that was a character that

2157.52 --> 2162.48
was very close to what it was like

2160.8 --> 2164.8
for me

2162.48 --> 2164.8
although

2166.32 --> 2169.6800000000003
yeah not exactly

2170.32 --> 2175.599
had some other influences as well

2173.68 --> 2178.16
but

2175.599 --> 2179.6800000000003
many ways it was like that just like

2178.16 --> 2182.24
silent

2179.68 --> 2184.48
and then suddenly like break out with

2182.24 --> 2187.839
brilliance because you really get it you

2184.48 --> 2187.839
just don't know how to

2188.64 --> 2195.4
really get it out there

2190.56 --> 2195.4
had to stand up for yourself etc etc

2225.04 --> 2228.839
yeah what is that

2235.76 --> 2241.1600000000003
oh

2238.0 --> 2241.16
all right

2251.119 --> 2254.6800000000003
freaking at

2268.72 --> 2272.56
where's the part where they actually use

2270.8 --> 2274.7200000000003
the sextant where you actually get to

2272.56 --> 2277.44
see

2274.72 --> 2277.4399999999996
the sextant

2278.56 --> 2282.2
i don't see it

2297.44 --> 2300.079
oh wait

2298.88 --> 2303.079

2300.079 --> 2303.079

2431.04 --> 2437.72
right and at 45 that's when they

2432.96 --> 2437.7200000000003
actually effectively use it i get it

2443.52 --> 2448.4
wow why is that sexton shaking like an

2446.64 --> 2451.4
idiot

2448.4 --> 2451.4

2655.359 --> 2658.72
the chat waiting for somebody to speak

2657.359 --> 2661.04
up

2658.72 --> 2663.839
i want to talk about something

2661.04 --> 2667.079

2663.839 --> 2667.0789999999997
the ready

2679.92 --> 2682.96
the only place you need a section is at

2682.16 --> 2685.96
sea

2682.96 --> 2685.96
mostly

2701.52 --> 2704.52

adam what the hell

2711.92 --> 2714.16
uh

2715.04 --> 2719.92
procession of the

2716.839 --> 2723.24
eknox why why what's so interesting

2719.92 --> 2723.2400000000002
about it

2732.96 --> 2737.599
it's a celestial pattern that happens

2735.599 --> 2739.839
apparently

2737.599 --> 2739.839
so

2740.0 --> 2744.68
what what's interesting about it

2765.839 --> 2775.0
how it shows the maps tropic labels

2770.72 --> 2775.0
are incorrect what do you mean

2783.76 --> 2788.28
are incorrect in what sense

2797.2 --> 2802.7999999999997
oh

2798.96 --> 2805.68
it's him again it's mr squirty boy

2802.8 --> 2807.92
yeah yeah that's right vincilantism

2805.68 --> 2810.0789999999997
against criminals

2807.92 --> 2812.16
when they are literally

2810.079 --> 2814.079
not being stopped not being arrested

2812.16 --> 2817.2799999999997
immediately being let go as soon as

2814.079 --> 2820.88
they're caught by police yeah

2817.28 --> 2824.079
that's what i said yeah yeah yeah that's

2820.88 --> 2826.4
that's your problem you can't handle it

2824.079 --> 2826.4
yeah

2826.96 --> 2832.079
yeah when

2828.48 --> 2834.319
when there's no justice because it's

2832.079 --> 2837.119
being suspended

2834.319 --> 2839.839
then vigilantism is the only answer or

2837.119 --> 2841.6800000000003

[Music]

3123.599 --> 3127.3590000000004
gil ambrose just stay the [ __ ] away from

3126.16 --> 3129.44
me

3127.359 --> 3132.16

yeah yeah okay nathan

3136.72 --> 3140.0789999999997
yeah that's okay you link it up

3145.2 --> 3150.24
right because i am not like oh just

3147.92 --> 3154.0
google no i don't want

3150.24 --> 3156.16
like groups to start getting killed

3154.0 --> 3160.16
i just want

3156.16 --> 3162.48
very specific discouragement

3160.16 --> 3164.3999999999996
right when i'm talking about oh just

3162.48 --> 3166.0
machine gun em

3164.4 --> 3167.52
was it yesterday or the day before i

3166.0 --> 3170.559
don't even remember

3167.52 --> 3172.96
because uh i stand behind that that's in

3170.559 --> 3176.3190000000004
specific response to

3172.96 --> 3181.119
criminal looting gangs

3176.319 --> 3184.0
or just straight out daylight murderers

3181.119 --> 3185.76
that are just being let go nobody's

3184.0 --> 3187.44
going after them they're just letting

3185.76 --> 3190.0
them do that right

3187.44 --> 3192.2400000000002
so they get more bold more evil more

3190.0 --> 3193.359
disgusting more ambitious with their

3192.24 --> 3196.0789999999997
greed

3193.359 --> 3198.5589999999997
and their hunger for destruction and the

3196.079 --> 3200.559
only way to actually stop that is by

3198.559 --> 3202.96
literally just

3200.559 --> 3205.599
yeah surprise attack and just kill them

3202.96 --> 3208.4
all bang right because then that sends a

3205.599 --> 3210.7200000000003
message like yeah oh you can go ahead

3208.4 --> 3213.359
but one day somebody can pop out of a

3210.72 --> 3216.72
room and suddenly you're all dead

3213.359 --> 3218.4
yeah that stops it since the police

3216.72 --> 3220.72
aren't stopping it

3218.4 --> 3223.599
that could stop it see so it actually

3220.72 --> 3226.64
had a purpose

3223.599 --> 3228.2400000000002
i'm not like oh just kill the globalist

3226.64 --> 3229.5989999999997
you don't even know what the [ __ ] you're

3228.24 --> 3233.0
talking about

3229.599 --> 3233.0
like a [ __ ]

3243.52 --> 3246.72
posted in 12 okay

3249.359 --> 3254.24
yeah people let's say cool the globalist

3252.88 --> 3256.96
in all caps

3254.24 --> 3260.0789999999997
they're not on my side you're a nobody's

3256.96 --> 3261.52
side you're you're just possessed by

3260.079 --> 3264.2400000000002
insanity

3261.52 --> 3265.359
you're just kill everything see that's

3264.24 --> 3268.64
every man

3265.359 --> 3268.64
you're just insane

3269.599 --> 3272.079
right

3270.559 --> 3276.8390000000004
i want

3272.079 --> 3280.1600000000003
good and life to survive and sometimes

3276.839 --> 3283.68
good can get in its own way

3280.16 --> 3287.2799999999997
because it wants to be good

3283.68 --> 3287.2799999999997
and i'm trying to deal with that

3289.44 --> 3294.96
deal with the spirit of that and to show

3292.72 --> 3294.9599999999996
that

3295.119 --> 3299.76
brutal

3297.28 --> 3302.6400000000003
actions are sometimes

3299.76 --> 3304.7990000000004
a solution sometimes but every it's

3302.64 --> 3307.5989999999997
always a risk every time every time a

3304.799 --> 3310.079
wound is struck somewhere in some way

3307.599 --> 3312.319
it will give a shock

3310.079 --> 3314.319
and that will make well squirted boys

3312.319 --> 3317.2
like that they would just

3314.319 --> 3318.839
just attack everything like a [ __ ]

3317.2 --> 3321.9199999999996
idiot yeah that

3318.839 --> 3325.119
also tends to then make those people

3321.92 --> 3325.119
worse unfortunately

3330.559 --> 3333.52
right

3331.52 --> 3335.44
so let's just say that a lot of my

3333.52 --> 3337.68
comments that are pretty extreme are

3335.44 --> 3341.04
more preventative

3337.68 --> 3343.44
as in like hey do [ __ ] something

3341.04 --> 3344.799
about this situation or this is what's

3343.44 --> 3346.559
gonna happen

3344.799 --> 3349.28
right

3346.559 --> 3351.599
it's a warning like hey if you keep

3349.28 --> 3355.44
doing this on purpose

3351.599 --> 3355.44
this is what is going to happen

3358.0 --> 3362.799
right it's not a call to oh

3360.319 --> 3364.079
let's destroy it all like [ __ ]

3362.799 --> 3366.559
retards

3364.079 --> 3370.559
like demon possessed pieces of [ __ ] that

3366.559 --> 3370.559
need to be put out of their misery

3372.559 --> 3376.6400000000003
yeah that's that's not what i want

3375.119 --> 3378.7200000000003
i want

3376.64 --> 3381.04
people to actually

3378.72 --> 3382.799
retain their senses and their

3381.04 --> 3385.04
sensibility

3382.799 --> 3386.96
and their ancient

3385.04 --> 3389.599
inner wisdom

3386.96 --> 3391.359
that's like part of the design from god

3389.599 --> 3394.079
and your ancestors

3391.359 --> 3395.359
that you can all utilize it and not get

3394.079 --> 3398.7200000000003
fooled

3395.359 --> 3398.72
to lay it all down

3398.96 --> 3402.799
to uphold the responsibility and the

3401.359 --> 3405.2799999999997
power

3402.799 --> 3408.319
the inner power that's what i want

3405.28 --> 3410.2400000000002
not for you to just give up and start

3408.319 --> 3413.599
destroying everything because you're a

3410.24 --> 3413.5989999999997
berserking idiot

3416.839 --> 3424.359
right so

3419.28 --> 3424.3590000000004
i hope i made that abundantly clear

3441.839 --> 3445.24
hello wrath

3472.799 --> 3477.52
i can't believe that weirdo actually

3474.88 --> 3480.96
thought he was on my side

3477.52 --> 3480.96
i think he actually meant that

3481.839 --> 3485.7599999999998
but

3482.559 --> 3490.7200000000003
then he must be just a guy that's just

3485.76 --> 3494.4
like i wanna go out and burn [ __ ] again

3490.72 --> 3494.3999999999996
like blm riots

3494.96 --> 3501.28
like oh just destroy everything

3498.0 --> 3502.88
kill the batman whoever that may seem to

3501.28 --> 3506.88
be at the moment

3502.88 --> 3506.88
right the total insanity

3507.68 --> 3510.8799999999997
pointless destruction

3511.2 --> 3517.839
that's not what i want i want that to be

3514.4 --> 3517.839
stopped more than anything

3521.44 --> 3527.04
right that's why i didn't shy away

3525.44 --> 3529.839
right when it happened

3527.04 --> 3531.52
as as [ __ ] was burning down in america

3529.839 --> 3534.16
and afterward

3531.52 --> 3536.799
calling blm yeah it is actually a

3534.16 --> 3538.96
terrorist organization and now their

3536.799 --> 3540.88
entire money scams

3538.96 --> 3542.88

3540.88 --> 3545.2000000000003

3549.04 --> 3554.799
organization and they're just abusing

3551.76 --> 3557.119
aggressive stupid people to destroy [ __ ]

3574.48 --> 3577.44
in

3575.359 --> 3579.7599999999998
2020 i think

3577.44 --> 3584.4
or was it

3579.76 --> 3586.559
2019 i don't remember it was yeah

3584.4 --> 3588.4
somewhere there

3586.559 --> 3590.3190000000004
and they're racist yeah of course but

3588.4 --> 3592.88
they're they're marxist everything is

3590.319 --> 3595.2

worst you could possibly imagine that's

3605.599 --> 3610.88
good for the blacks right

3608.079 --> 3613.52
just act like [ __ ] demons destroy

3610.88 --> 3615.2000000000003
burn [ __ ] kill random people because of

3613.52 --> 3618.16
their skin color all that's gonna make

3615.2 --> 3620.3999999999996
blacks look so good it's gonna make you

3618.16 --> 3623.359
so beloved oh

3620.4 --> 3628.44
yeah that's blm they're [ __ ]

3623.359 --> 3628.44
satanic scumbag marxist

3638.079 --> 3644.88
black wall street massacre my

3642.24 --> 3644.8799999999997

out of here you [ __ ]

3658.16 --> 3661.2
get out of here

3661.599 --> 3666.079
get out of here

3664.0 --> 3669.359
you don't even have to freaking balls to

3666.079 --> 3672.1600000000003

3669.359 --> 3672.16

useless [ __ ]

3703.839 --> 3706.839
so

3714.079 --> 3718.88
right

3716.079 --> 3721.44
i've made a powerful enemy is so a

3718.88 --> 3723.039
powerful enemy

3721.44 --> 3726.079
when i asked him hey why didn't you

3723.039 --> 3729.44
report me he said no because i like you

3726.079 --> 3731.599
oh you're such a powerful enemy oh i'm

3729.44 --> 3735.039
so impressed

3731.599 --> 3736.6400000000003
mr gamma wanker

3735.039 --> 3738.0
so impressed

3736.64 --> 3742.16
god

3738.0 --> 3742.16
look at yourself look at what you become

3743.76 --> 3747.7990000000004
jesus really

3755.119 --> 3759.44
pentagon is missing two points yeah but

3756.96 --> 3761.44
they always have to outdo it with

3759.44 --> 3762.48
everything else

3761.44 --> 3764.319
right

3762.48 --> 3766.559
i mean i think sometimes i think that

3764.319 --> 3770.319
the pentagon is just creating these

3766.559 --> 3773.6800000000003
crazy terrorist scamming groups

3770.319 --> 3776.64
just so they can steal more

3773.68 --> 3778.64
and not look that bad in comparison

3776.64 --> 3780.64
they basically create straw man

3778.64 --> 3781.52
terrorist organizations

3780.64 --> 3784.8799999999997
to

3781.52 --> 3786.559
yeah to distract away from how [ __ ] up

3784.88 --> 3789.359
they really are sometimes that's what i

3786.559 --> 3789.3590000000004
think they're doing

3795.28 --> 3799.599
i mean that's that's

3797.599 --> 3802.0
not even a joke really

3799.599 --> 3803.6800000000003
that may actually literally be their

3802.0 --> 3805.92
tactical

3803.68 --> 3808.799
system that they do use

3805.92 --> 3812.16
it's like oh guys yeah we're gonna

3808.799 --> 3813.599
steal some more money from taxpayers so

3812.16 --> 3816.0789999999997
we're gonna have to create another

3813.599 --> 3817.44
terrorist organization again

3816.079 --> 3818.88
make them

3817.44 --> 3820.96
like yeah just

3818.88 --> 3823.52
encourage people to steal money scam

3820.96 --> 3826.48
even lay out exactly how to do it right

3823.52 --> 3829.68
give them all the plans of how we do it

3826.48 --> 3831.44
let them do it record it then expose it

3829.68 --> 3833.9199999999996
and then oh

3831.44 --> 3836.96
they'll just forget about how we stole

3833.92 --> 3839.039
like a hundred times more than they did

3836.96 --> 3842.4
that like that may actually be an

3839.039 --> 3845.039
officially registered tactic they use

3842.4 --> 3846.88
that they have in white papers okay i'm

3845.039 --> 3848.88
not even kidding

3846.88 --> 3852.6800000000003
is this is

3848.88 --> 3852.6800000000003
probably true

3854.0 --> 3859.839
allegedly i can't prove it but

3856.88 --> 3861.839
i would not be surprised one bit if it

3859.839 --> 3864.24
is in a white paper somewhere that they

3861.839 --> 3864.24
put out

3864.4 --> 3869.6800000000003
right like a straw man

3867.119 --> 3869.6800000000003
exactly

3875.76 --> 3881.44
right yeah that's right that one guy

3877.76 --> 3884.079
because the blacks they even allow in

3881.44 --> 3887.44
have to be satanic it's like they they

3884.079 --> 3889.6800000000003
lit i think they literally like tell him

3887.44 --> 3889.68
like

3889.92 --> 3895.76
you're satanist now you're with the

3893.119 --> 3897.28
with the true power that means you have

3895.76 --> 3899.119
to now

3897.28 --> 3900.1600000000003
attack black people

3899.119 --> 3902.7200000000003
right

3900.16 --> 3905.0389999999998
everybody has to attack their own if

3902.72 --> 3908.64
you're a satanist then you have to

3905.039 --> 3910.88
attack what you perceive as your own

3908.64 --> 3914.0789999999997
i think they literally do that and

3910.88 --> 3915.76
that's why like in the core group there

3914.079 --> 3918.0
isn't even that many black people in

3915.76 --> 3920.079
there

3918.0 --> 3922.88
like numpties that don't really listen

3920.079 --> 3924.88
too well that kind of like let there let

3922.88 --> 3928.079
that roll past them

3924.88 --> 3929.359
and some really [ __ ] up actual satanic

3928.079 --> 3931.3590000000004
black guys

3929.359 --> 3934.64
and most of them are just white squirter

3931.359 --> 3934.64
boys that are just [ __ ]

3935.52 --> 3938.72
and women that just want that want to

3937.839 --> 3942.96
wean

3938.72 --> 3942.9599999999996
and all that just ugh not

3943.119 --> 3950.039
and there's probably here in there some

3945.28 --> 3950.039
groups that actually meant well

3950.079 --> 3954.88
that are not even aware of how [ __ ] up

3952.64 --> 3956.64
it can get

3954.88 --> 3958.6400000000003
i don't know

3956.64 --> 3960.319
but like the yeah

3958.64 --> 3963.2799999999997
the main group

3960.319 --> 3967.52
they're satanic

3963.28 --> 3970.4
they are there to destroy black people

3967.52 --> 3973.28
to ruin them and their image

3970.4 --> 3973.28
in the country

3973.76 --> 3978.48
to make them

3975.039 --> 3981.119
hate it to turn them into like a weapon

3978.48 --> 3984.16
against everyone like satanists do

3981.119 --> 3988.6400000000003
that's what blm is this is like it's

3984.16 --> 3988.64
spiritual level terrorist organization

3989.76 --> 3993.079
very serious

4013.92 --> 4016.92
hmm

4027.2 --> 4030.2
right

4037.039 --> 4041.6800000000003
right reno yeah

4039.44 --> 4043.599
of race estimated self-important

4041.68 --> 4045.7599999999998
syndrome or just

4043.599 --> 4047.28
bloated frog syndrome

4045.76 --> 4049.8390000000004
just like

4047.28 --> 4051.44
i'm so powerful but it's more gas

4049.839 --> 4054.799
lighting themselves right they're just

4051.44 --> 4056.96
filled filling up with gas

4054.799 --> 4060.319
and they seem really big to themselves

4056.96 --> 4060.319
bloated frog syndrome

4061.119 --> 4066.88
because you just have to do

4062.88 --> 4066.88
and it's and it's done right

4074.16 --> 4078.3999999999996
why so why not go show

4077.44 --> 4080.7200000000003
shot

4078.4 --> 4080.7200000000003
down

4082.079 --> 4086.7200000000003
does white satanic who have infiltrated

4084.64 --> 4089.2799999999997
what what what does that mean i don't

4086.72 --> 4091.5989999999997
understand your sentence

4089.28 --> 4094.7200000000003
a lack of self-awareness

4091.599 --> 4097.4400000000005
well yeah but it's a problem like i i

4094.72 --> 4099.599999999999
have minor issues with the two i i kind

4097.44 --> 4102.4
of get a little bit bloaty frog too but

4099.6 --> 4104.159000000001
i try to not overdo it right because it

4102.4 --> 4106.799
just makes you look stupid when you

4104.159 --> 4106.799
overreach

4109.04 --> 4116.159
if you can't afterward back up

4112.719 --> 4118.4800000000005
the power that you like crush into the

4116.159 --> 4120.48
moment it just makes you look like an

4118.48 --> 4121.599999999999
idiot

4120.48 --> 4124.48
right

4121.6 --> 4126.4800000000005
you can't overshoot

4124.48 --> 4129.3589999999995
in when you do that or it just makes you

4126.48 --> 4130.839
look like an idiot

4129.359 --> 4134.4800000000005
and people are

4130.839 --> 4137.839
very quick these days to figure that out

4134.48 --> 4137.839
when somebody overshoots

4139.279 --> 4145.040000000001
you say that whites have infiltrated blm

4142.799 --> 4146.56
that just that's just like antifa and

4145.04 --> 4150.64
all that they're

4146.56 --> 4152.0
it's all just an inter it's like a weird

4150.64 --> 4155.1990000000005
cult

4152.0 --> 4157.6
corporate system it's like a big group

4155.199 --> 4161.839
and they have

4157.6 --> 4161.839
like associations with antifa

4163.679 --> 4168.0
so

4164.96 --> 4169.6
yeah it's a giant mess

4168.0 --> 4172.4
they have whites

4169.6 --> 4174.719
in blm too

4172.4 --> 4176.96
right but i think that they kind of then

4174.719 --> 4179.12
they segregated they have like blacks

4176.96 --> 4180.88
that are really like like no we have to

4179.12 --> 4183.599999999999
all be black in this group or i'm going

4180.88 --> 4185.359
to be pissed off at whitey

4183.6 --> 4188.159000000001
they have those groups

4185.359 --> 4190.2390000000005
in blm too but it's a pretty big group

4188.159 --> 4195.239
from what i've heard

4190.239 --> 4195.239
so it's kind of splintered like that

4206.56 --> 4209.120000000001
what the hell

4209.52 --> 4214.64
so why not go kill them cut off that

4212.32 --> 4217.199
because just going after them is just

4214.64 --> 4219.360000000001
gonna start like a giant gang war

4217.199 --> 4221.759999999999
that's kind of what they want

4219.36 --> 4223.44
what you should instead do is like swift

4221.76 --> 4225.92
justice right

4223.44 --> 4227.28
so when some of those pieces of [ __ ]

4225.92 --> 4228.56
just start

4227.28 --> 4230.88
like

4228.56 --> 4232.4800000000005
smacking people on the back of the head

4230.88 --> 4235.36
with a brick in the middle of the

4232.48 --> 4238.0
daylight on the street

4235.36 --> 4240.08
that's the moment where you grab the gun

4238.0 --> 4242.56
and shoot him right through the head

4240.08 --> 4246.4
bang dead [ __ ]

4242.56 --> 4249.6
right that no like organize some kind of

4246.4 --> 4253.599999999999
a street war it's just quick response

4249.6 --> 4254.88
like they do that [ __ ] dead

4253.6 --> 4256.96
that's

4254.88 --> 4259.76
what i'm talking about because that way

4256.96 --> 4261.04
yeah it's brutal it's brutal but guess

4259.76 --> 4262.64
what

4261.04 --> 4266.08
you think they're gonna keep on doing

4262.64 --> 4267.92
that it when they get to here like oh

4266.08 --> 4271.36
somebody tried to do that he was

4267.92 --> 4273.679
instantly killed oh oh you think they're

4271.36 --> 4276.239
easily just gonna do that then no no

4273.679 --> 4278.32
it's all about discouragement

4276.239 --> 4280.5599999999995
that's what it's about

4278.32 --> 4283.5199999999995
they have to know you can't do that [ __ ]

4280.56 --> 4284.320000000001
anymore or people will get wild west on

4283.52 --> 4286.159000000001
you

4284.32 --> 4286.88
like in the wild west if you did that

4286.159 --> 4291.04
[ __ ]

4286.88 --> 4293.04
bang dead immediately no questions asked

4291.04 --> 4294.88
people would just literally

4293.04 --> 4296.0
see that and then go about their

4294.88 --> 4299.0
business

4296.0 --> 4299.0
right

4301.679 --> 4307.1990000000005
and yeah being a criminal in the wild

4304.159 --> 4308.0
west was really dangerous because of

4307.199 --> 4308.96
that

4308.0 --> 4313.04
right

4308.96 --> 4314.4
can't you imagine if they were [ __ ]

4313.04 --> 4316.32
back then

4314.4 --> 4317.5199999999995
it would have been a giant hellhole and

4316.32 --> 4319.44
hey in some

4317.52 --> 4322.159000000001
spots it kind of was like that where

4319.44 --> 4325.678999999999
like criminal gangs psychopaths

4322.159 --> 4329.32
would literally have everybody cocked

4325.679 --> 4329.32
and it was a hell

4329.679 --> 4334.0
well why don't you learn from that

4332.08 --> 4335.04
you gotta be brutal

4334.0 --> 4338.08
against

4335.04 --> 4341.28
demonic madness like this

4338.08 --> 4343.6
gotta be hard no [ __ ] around no oh

4341.28 --> 4346.159
they just didn't know all this or that

4343.6 --> 4348.719
no no no they literally

4346.159 --> 4350.5599999999995
knowingly with full disrespect for

4348.719 --> 4351.52
everything and everyone including god

4350.56 --> 4353.92
just

4351.52 --> 4355.4400000000005
try to murder somebody in in the

4353.92 --> 4359.52
daylight

4355.44 --> 4359.5199999999995
that's terror tactic

4359.76 --> 4363.76
the proper response is instantly kill

4362.48 --> 4367.639999999999
them

4363.76 --> 4367.64
no questions asked

4382.159 --> 4386.32
yeah and that almost never happens right

4386.48 --> 4390.32
but when it does

4388.239 --> 4392.239
yeah that

4390.32 --> 4394.88
lethal force bang

4392.239 --> 4394.879999999999
immediately

4394.96 --> 4400.0
right and then they won't do it anymore

4397.36 --> 4403.36
they will just stick to being like their

4400.0 --> 4405.36
own little secret backroom cabal

4403.36 --> 4407.759999999999
squirting all day kind of like what a

4405.36 --> 4410.799999999999
lot of neo-nazis

4407.76 --> 4413.6
were and maybe still are

4410.8 --> 4416.56
right because they can't just do that

4413.6 --> 4419.1990000000005
[ __ ] because they'll immediately get

4416.56 --> 4420.8
arrested or they'll get shot

4419.199 --> 4423.5199999999995
right

4420.8 --> 4425.92
so they go back in their little rooms

4423.52 --> 4427.84
and conspire all day and brew like oh

4425.92 --> 4429.76
we're gonna take it over right because

4427.84 --> 4432.4800000000005
you don't want them to just think they

4429.76 --> 4435.84
can go out and just kill people in

4432.48 --> 4437.28
terrorist actions like that

4435.84 --> 4440.8
right

4437.28 --> 4444.08
so let's do that with the freaking blm

4440.8 --> 4444.08
crazy bastards

4447.679 --> 4452.56
the ones that are actually like really

4449.76 --> 4454.8
[ __ ] evil and murderous that is

4452.56 --> 4457.4400000000005
it's not just like

4454.8 --> 4459.4400000000005
regular folks that thought that blm was

4457.44 --> 4460.639999999999
pro-black right not that not the

4459.44 --> 4464.08
numpties

4460.64 --> 4466.400000000001
that were just fooled into it right like

4464.08 --> 4467.199
they're not gonna kill anybody

4466.4 --> 4470.48
right

4467.199 --> 4474.32
talking about the real the real freaks

4470.48 --> 4474.32
the real racist murderers

4475.52 --> 4479.4800000000005
