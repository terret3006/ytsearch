189.84 --> 197.36
uh right oh dear

193.84 --> 198.48
did i make oh [ __ ] i knew it yes i knew

197.36 --> 201.76000000000002
it

198.48 --> 204.23899999999998
i forgot to make notes after a point so

201.76 --> 204.239
typical

205.2 --> 210.48
even though i do remember doing quite a

206.879 --> 212.159
lot of things it's stupid

210.48 --> 214.72
i should always just have this note

212.159 --> 217.76
right in front of me the whole day

214.72 --> 220.4
this notebook but yeah i forget it after

217.76 --> 220.39999999999998
a certain point

223.2 --> 227.83999999999997
hold on let me update this

233.439 --> 240.159
i remember this morning at least i was

235.599 --> 242.56
watching good servants solo hangout i

240.159 --> 245.28
communicated back to him for a bit

242.56 --> 246.799
about the overall sound quality and i i

245.28 --> 248.4
guess i should have said it before but

246.799 --> 250.0
it just started to really take notice

248.4 --> 252.64000000000001
that

250.0 --> 254.64
his mic is pretty shitty and it's kind

252.64 --> 256.639
of like it feels like he's talking into

254.64 --> 257.519
a paper bag because you can barely hear

256.639 --> 260.56
any high-pitched

257.519 --> 262.24
sounds coming through it i know i find

260.56 --> 264.479
it difficult

262.24 --> 266.56
to follow sometimes so i advised him

264.479 --> 269.36
like get a better mic

266.56 --> 271.6
or at least test it out if it is your

269.36 --> 271.6
mic

272.16 --> 276.47900000000004
you know borrow a mic from somebody else

274.72 --> 279.36
and compare the sound

276.479 --> 280.56
because you you're not it it's not

279.36 --> 285.199
necessarily the mic

280.56 --> 285.199
itself you're never really too sure

286.639 --> 291.919
right yeah yeah good servant that's okay

292.72 --> 296.72
uh yeah and also spurs skimo i didn't

295.68 --> 299.12
see it live though

296.72 --> 300.72
you think good servant did so yeah i

299.12 --> 303.759
just watched the

300.72 --> 307.28000000000003
replay after just

303.759 --> 309.36
more ballers ballers [ __ ]

307.28 --> 311.44
oh thank you good servant for the 99

309.36 --> 314.96000000000004
cent super chatter nation

311.44 --> 314.96
hey hello tracy cole

316.56 --> 319.36
right um

319.919 --> 328.56
oh yeah

325.52 --> 331.919
right i've concluded that pretty much

328.56 --> 333.68
my back problem is completely gone the

331.919 --> 336.4
only thing now is that i am

333.68 --> 338.0
a little stiff but i think it's more due

336.4 --> 340.96
to the overall weather

338.0 --> 343.6
because it's not really local it's just

340.96 --> 343.59999999999997
that i feel

348.4 --> 352.56
but at least i'm not having a lock-up

351.36 --> 355.91900000000004
situation

352.56 --> 355.919
in the back and that's nice

361.28 --> 366.63899999999995
tom parker what after watching qe

363.6 --> 370.319
yesterday you think

366.639 --> 373.68
cow who is cow

370.319 --> 373.68
may become a flat earther

379.8 --> 385.84000000000003
anti-corona measurement demo

383.12 --> 388.4
this saturday in berlin got forbidden i

385.84 --> 388.4
mean what

390.319 --> 395.84000000000003
he was debating qe

399.36 --> 403.36
hmm right the guy that was on yesterday

401.919 --> 404.24
on the flat earth debates right that's

403.36 --> 409.84000000000003
what you mean

404.24 --> 409.84000000000003
i don't know his name

410.0 --> 414.24
he kind of dropped off afterward yeah

412.72 --> 414.88000000000005
who knows i don't know where the guy

414.24 --> 416.96000000000004
stands

414.88 --> 418.4
i've never seen him before heard of him

416.96 --> 421.919
so

418.4 --> 422.23999999999995
who knows you know not everybody that

421.919 --> 425.599
like

422.24 --> 426.319
drops in even from a ball believer

425.599 --> 428.24
perspective

426.319 --> 431.28000000000003
is necessarily a baller a lot of them

428.24 --> 434.72
are just normies

431.28 --> 438.55999999999995
and they still show signs of

434.72 --> 441.52000000000004
in like genuine integrity

438.56 --> 443.52
so yeah who knows it's not the first

441.52 --> 446.88
time

443.52 --> 449.44
remember the other tom tommy

446.88 --> 451.52
from a long time ago he came back and he

449.44 --> 453.599
was he's now a flat earther

451.52 --> 454.96
even yeah talked about it on the flat

453.599 --> 458.15999999999997
earth debates

454.96 --> 460.23999999999995
i was amazed that he was so caught up in

458.16 --> 460.24
it

460.479 --> 468.56
so yeah it happens

464.24 --> 472.16
you're a normie nag with servant

468.56 --> 472.16
and you're not really a normie

472.8 --> 479.84000000000003
you can think of yourself as a normie

480.08 --> 484.24
forbidden by berlin officials but the

482.4 --> 487.919
lawyers tried to let it happen

484.24 --> 490.0
okay well i'm not too up-to-date to the

487.919 --> 492.479
intricacies of what is happening in

490.0 --> 495.599
germany but i am getting

492.479 --> 497.599
yeah there is some feedback

495.599 --> 499.44
through through alternative media

497.599 --> 502.87899999999996
channels that some things get brought up

499.44 --> 502.879
but usually it's not good

503.28 --> 508.15999999999997
so like crackdowns on corona protests or

506.8 --> 510.879
just

508.16 --> 512.5600000000001
more things about people wearing masks

510.879 --> 516.479
and still getting beaten down by the

512.56 --> 516.4789999999999
police for some nonsensical reason

516.8 --> 522.959
that sort of thing anyway

520.719 --> 522.9590000000001
ah

524.48 --> 529.12
right anyway big bear yesterday was not

527.92 --> 531.279
live

529.12 --> 533.16
was another replay a very old stream it

531.279 --> 534.32
was funny to see that it was like a

533.16 --> 537.8389999999999
pre-grabbler

534.32 --> 538.399
era so the whole focus was completely

537.839 --> 541.0400000000001
different

538.399 --> 542.399
in that it was it was kind of

541.04 --> 545.04
interesting from that

542.399 --> 545.519
from a studying perspective to see that

545.04 --> 548.64
was it

545.519 --> 550.72
like in his old house too

548.64 --> 552.3199999999999
i think or was it his brother's side it

550.72 --> 555.839
was not the the

552.32 --> 558.399
ursa manor at least so yeah

555.839 --> 561.2790000000001
i didn't watch the whole thing got

558.399 --> 563.839
started watching other things

561.279 --> 563.8389999999999
uh

568.88 --> 572.16
right i saw

573.519 --> 577.839
natural news i still follow it

581.36 --> 585.04
that mike adams had a pretty radical

583.279 --> 588.48
article you know he

585.04 --> 588.48
he he he does get

588.56 --> 593.92
is it radical is it really that radical

591.2 --> 597.12
he does get very

593.92 --> 599.4399999999999
i say inflamed how do you call that

597.12 --> 601.2
just passionate i don't know that sounds

599.44 --> 603.839
kind of euphemist

601.2 --> 605.839
but he he does really he is really

603.839 --> 607.9200000000001
passionate

605.839 --> 609.2790000000001
for freedom and self-defense and all

607.92 --> 612.0
that and he had this article this

609.279 --> 612.0
morning about

613.12 --> 616.5600000000001
yeah how police should stop standing

616.079 --> 620.079
down

616.56 --> 621.92
in the face of blm writers and all that

620.079 --> 624.079
because they're causing so much damage

621.92 --> 625.04
and just these videos keep on coming out

624.079 --> 627.1999999999999
and it's

625.04 --> 630.8389999999999
like it's really difficult for me now to

627.2 --> 633.839
watch and not just become completely

630.839 --> 633.839
enraged

636.0 --> 644.32
because you know

639.76 --> 647.04
they're all such they're so cowardly

644.32 --> 647.839
like the spirit of these rioters are so

647.04 --> 650.88
cowardly they

647.839 --> 652.9590000000001
they attack the defenseless or the

650.88 --> 654.399
people that aren't even like attacking

652.959 --> 661.8389999999999
them

654.399 --> 661.839
it's just

664.32 --> 668.399
anyway yeah i'm getting a bit caught up

667.2 --> 671.519
in that

668.399 --> 671.519
it's not very healthy

672.959 --> 678.7199999999999
just cause it was me more large yeah

675.279 --> 678.72
more loud screaming

681.44 --> 683.9200000000001
anyway

686.48 --> 690.399
inside shops i'm probably out of 2000.

688.959 --> 694.0
yeah that's

690.399 --> 694.0
i won't work for that since satan

700.839 --> 703.839
like

706.959 --> 711.68
that that's not going on here as far as

710.24 --> 717.839
i know

711.68 --> 717.8389999999999
they better not

722.21 --> 725.9200000000001
[Music]

723.839 --> 727.12
but yeah you know after a certain point

725.92 --> 729.1999999999999
when those kind of

727.12 --> 730.8
insane orders start to happen i'm just

729.2 --> 734.1600000000001
wondering like

730.8 --> 737.68
what about the police they're supposedly

734.16 --> 740.56
enforcing that right it's right

737.68 --> 742.959
or is it a separate appointed group that

740.56 --> 744.959
does that that's not officially police

742.959 --> 746.6389999999999
i don't know maybe that that's different

744.959 --> 749.04
per region

746.639 --> 750.24
but i think overall it is the police and

749.04 --> 752.079
it shouldn't be

750.24 --> 754.519
it's so wrong they shouldn't follow

752.079 --> 758.0
those artists it's completely

754.519 --> 759.279
unconstitutional from any country's

758.0 --> 761.6
perspective

759.279 --> 761.6
you know

766.88 --> 774.16
so why aren't

770.839 --> 775.9200000000001
police rebelling that's what i'm

774.16 --> 777.76
wondering like why aren't the police

775.92 --> 781.519
just saying like

777.76 --> 784.72
no we're not doing that

781.519 --> 784.72
you can't fire us

784.839 --> 789.2
and we are going to stop other police

788.24 --> 791.92
officers that

789.2 --> 793.36
are that one for whatever reason go

791.92 --> 797.36
along with it

793.36 --> 799.279
almost like a union counter response

797.36 --> 801.76
but yeah the unions you know they don't

799.279 --> 803.519
really

801.76 --> 806.639
function the way they're supposed to

803.519 --> 811.2
anymore they're all caught up in the

806.639 --> 814.24
in the leftist networks

811.2 --> 816.9590000000001
but yeah if the police

814.24 --> 817.279
kind of like just say no you're not

816.959 --> 819.04
gonna

817.279 --> 820.48
we're not going to enforce this this is

819.04 --> 823.5999999999999
illegal

820.48 --> 824.399
then i i think that would help a lot it

823.6 --> 828.5600000000001
would also

824.399 --> 831.68
restore some of the moral situation

828.56 --> 834.88
in a location where that happens

831.68 --> 836.2399999999999
you know it's very important that that

834.88 --> 838.72
people

836.24 --> 840.48
have the feeling that police is on their

838.72 --> 842.0
side that they're actually there to

840.48 --> 845.12
enforce the real law

842.0 --> 847.76
and protect people

845.12 --> 848.32
and when this sort of situation goes on

847.76 --> 850.88
and they're

848.32 --> 852.0790000000001
basically finding people for ridiculous

850.88 --> 853.92
things

852.079 --> 855.92
then yeah the opposite happens and

853.92 --> 858.959
people get the feeling like they're

855.92 --> 860.88
like they're in nazi germany too for a

858.959 --> 871.8389999999999
very rough comparison

860.88 --> 871.8389999999999
no and it's just what's that gonna do

876.56 --> 880.4799999999999
more colored i don't know if that's

878.399 --> 883.92
universally true

880.48 --> 887.44
i know that usa has had certain

883.92 --> 887.4399999999999
recruitment profiles

888.639 --> 894.32
and yeah they have recruited a lot of

891.04 --> 894.3199999999999
not very smart people

895.04 --> 899.4399999999999
but i don't know if that's exactly the

897.04 --> 902.639
same throughout the entire country

899.44 --> 902.639
i don't know how that works

903.199 --> 907.4399999999999
but there should still be just people

905.12 --> 910.88
that know what they're doing

907.44 --> 914.8800000000001
in there that should

910.88 --> 918.399
be able to get a grip and and

914.88 --> 918.399
keep the others in line

920.16 --> 928.56
to be real police officers and not

923.76 --> 928.56
and not some political enforcement arm

929.44 --> 931.839
anyway

938.8 --> 942.4799999999999
what is that link more colored

948.0 --> 954.56
us court ruling you can be too smart to

950.959 --> 958.959
be a cop what

954.56 --> 958.959
that is what

966.959 --> 969.8389999999999
what

974.16 --> 981.68
i i'm just really baffled about that

978.48 --> 996.72
thanks more colored what

981.68 --> 999.04
is hey adamikin

996.72 --> 1000.399
right well good servant again that's a

999.04 --> 1002.88
recruitment policy

1000.399 --> 1004.0
i guess but that doesn't mean that

1002.88 --> 1006.48
there's not

1004.0 --> 1006.48
i don't know

1007.04 --> 1010.88
people that have the real police spirit

1010.16 --> 1013.92
in them that

1010.88 --> 1015.6
really want to be a real good cop i

1013.92 --> 1016.639
think there should be plenty around you

1015.6 --> 1018.639
know

1016.639 --> 1019.92
still and they're not really getting a

1018.639 --> 1022.16
chance i guess

1019.92 --> 1022.16
well

1022.959 --> 1029.36
those people should not be left

1026.72 --> 1031.039
to do nothing to just waste that good

1029.36 --> 1034.0
spirit

1031.039 --> 1034.959
so how do we get them in the police

1034.0 --> 1038.0
again or

1034.959 --> 1041.1200000000001
in some replacement thing you know

1038.0 --> 1041.12
that that's the idea

1042.24 --> 1045.1200000000001
how do you do that

1051.52 --> 1055.52
right i i don't really know they joined

1054.559 --> 1059.44
the military

1055.52 --> 1061.679
oh dear okay

1059.44 --> 1062.88
well that look if that's gonna be the

1061.679 --> 1064.64
way that's done then

1062.88 --> 1067.1200000000001
then there's a problem too especially in

1064.64 --> 1069.2800000000002
the usa look if the military

1067.12 --> 1070.3999999999999
people are simply going to replace the

1069.28 --> 1073.039
police

1070.4 --> 1073.44
well they're they're also military or

1073.039 --> 1076.64
maybe

1073.44 --> 1076.64
ex-military then or

1078.0 --> 1081.2
maybe it could work i don't know i don't

1080.32 --> 1084.72
know

1081.2 --> 1087.679
that i my head is not that extensive on

1084.72 --> 1088.72
how to do it yet i'm just trying to

1087.679 --> 1092.3200000000002
really

1088.72 --> 1095.919
figure out a very easy starting point

1092.32 --> 1100.0
like what what could you try to do

1095.919 --> 1102.48
roughly together people that are

1100.0 --> 1104.32
still there in the face of all this

1102.48 --> 1107.84
insanity

1104.32 --> 1110.72
and corruption because

1107.84 --> 1111.039
yeah i don't know history has proven

1110.72 --> 1114.799
that

1111.039 --> 1117.28
it you don't need hierarchical structure

1114.799 --> 1118.48
necessarily you just need a couple of

1117.28 --> 1120.96
good people that have

1118.48 --> 1122.0
natural authority and respect because

1120.96 --> 1123.76
they do the good the

1122.0 --> 1125.52
right thing and everybody needs that and

1123.76 --> 1128.4
wants that and then that enforce

1125.52 --> 1131.039
that makes like a spiritual hierarchy

1128.4 --> 1133.3600000000001
rather than some official hierarchy

1131.039 --> 1133.36
you know

1134.48 --> 1138.559
so the more problematic is is that

1136.64 --> 1140.96
really good effective

1138.559 --> 1142.24
people that could maintain a good

1140.96 --> 1143.919
morality and order

1142.24 --> 1145.36
in a location that they're not getting a

1143.919 --> 1147.6000000000001
good chance

1145.36 --> 1148.6399999999999
to do that because the system is rigged

1147.6 --> 1151.52
against that

1148.64 --> 1153.039
so how do we negate that how do we put

1151.52 --> 1157.12
those people

1153.039 --> 1159.52
back in the positions where they can

1157.12 --> 1161.28
properly maintain order

1159.52 --> 1163.12
how do you do that i think that's

1161.28 --> 1178.799
something that a lot of people should be

1163.12 --> 1181.039
thinking about right now

1178.799 --> 1183.52
oh god well more colored look school

1181.039 --> 1185.84
situations especially in germany is just

1183.52 --> 1185.84
nuts

1186.88 --> 1193.8400000000001
it's crazy what they do there

1208.08 --> 1223.84
let me see some other things

1220.64 --> 1223.8400000000001
ah [ __ ] sake

1224.64 --> 1228.48
firefox keeps crashing on me

1229.679 --> 1234.159
yeah and by the way they re i've had

1232.4 --> 1237.76
some weird experiences with

1234.159 --> 1238.48
chrome as well joining the hangouts with

1237.76 --> 1241.52
nathan

1238.48 --> 1242.559
because at times i don't know how it

1241.52 --> 1246.1589999999999
works

1242.559 --> 1246.48
but it kind of like something is sniping

1246.159 --> 1249.7600000000002
me

1246.48 --> 1250.64
from the panel sometimes it's very weird

1249.76 --> 1252.24
i can get back

1250.64 --> 1254.159
but it literally even says somebody

1252.24 --> 1257.52
removed you and like what

1254.159 --> 1260.5590000000002
that's not even physically possible

1257.52 --> 1262.4
yet it still happens

1260.559 --> 1264.48
when it happens it usually happens a

1262.4 --> 1265.2
couple of times in a row very annoying

1264.48 --> 1268.559
it

1265.2 --> 1269.6000000000001
makes no sense but firefox just straight

1268.559 --> 1277.12
out crashes

1269.6 --> 1280.0
regularly now

1277.12 --> 1281.52
good servant thank you for the 99 cent

1280.0 --> 1285.84
super chat donation yeah

1281.52 --> 1285.84
paypal donations would be nice sure

1286.32 --> 1294.799
what is this yeah

1289.76 --> 1294.799
so i never tried a cbd pen

1298.48 --> 1305.039
all right oh mark collard i think in

1302.48 --> 1308.08
this case

1305.039 --> 1310.559
that his son is doing it for the thc

1308.08 --> 1311.28
and cbd combined because he is using it

1310.559 --> 1315.44
to

1311.28 --> 1318.559
to sleep right well yeah

1315.44 --> 1321.919
just cbd alone

1318.559 --> 1324.32
tends to not immediately influence you

1321.919 --> 1325.3600000000001
to to like get sleepy i don't know if it

1324.32 --> 1328.96
will work

1325.36 --> 1333.84
for that purpose anyway but cbd is still

1328.96 --> 1333.8400000000001
a good idea anyway

1344.159 --> 1349.1200000000001
well no firefox was first

1355.44 --> 1362.3200000000002
i it's not like chrome

1358.64 --> 1365.2
but hey a lot of browser software

1362.32 --> 1366.72
universally is kind of the same because

1365.2 --> 1370.0800000000002
it's all been

1366.72 --> 1372.48
uh how do you say modulized like

1370.08 --> 1375.36
software works like modules now so

1372.48 --> 1377.28
there's just prefabricated very

1375.36 --> 1380.3999999999999
effective structures

1377.28 --> 1380.8799999999999
that cover most of what it's supposed to

1380.4 --> 1383.52
do

1380.88 --> 1384.64
that you can just stick an interface or

1383.52 --> 1387.36
another program

1384.64 --> 1388.64
onto very easily so it's all modulized

1387.36 --> 1390.9599999999998
you know back in the day

1388.64 --> 1392.0800000000002
everything had to be literally

1390.96 --> 1395.919
programmed like

1392.08 --> 1398.0
one giant code and it all had to work it

1395.919 --> 1401.3600000000001
out well now it's all been modulized

1398.0 --> 1404.64
like java kind of started that

1401.36 --> 1407.6789999999999
that idea and

1404.64 --> 1411.2
it's turned out to be very effective

1407.679 --> 1413.039
because of the increasing

1411.2 --> 1415.3600000000001
speed of technology and all that so

1413.039 --> 1417.2
modules become very effective and help

1415.36 --> 1418.3999999999999
oversight in programming i i've

1417.2 --> 1419.919
supported it

1418.4 --> 1421.919
even though i'm not even programmer i

1419.919 --> 1424.24
know about this i know about how that

1421.919 --> 1425.039
works i can't program but i know how it

1424.24 --> 1427.52
works

1425.039 --> 1429.52
and yeah because of modules a lot of

1427.52 --> 1433.039
software is very much alike

1429.52 --> 1436.8799999999999
and even new software companies

1433.039 --> 1440.64
might typically or like like a new

1436.88 --> 1443.0390000000002
website might just typically grab

1440.64 --> 1444.88
a couple of modules that are suited for

1443.039 --> 1447.919
what they want to do

1444.88 --> 1450.96
stick it together and then make a nice

1447.919 --> 1453.2
interface and looks on it but yes

1450.96 --> 1455.3600000000001
it will typically work very much the

1453.2 --> 1458.32
same like other programs because

1455.36 --> 1460.7199999999998
it's probably consistent of similar or

1458.32 --> 1463.52
or literally the same original modules

1460.72 --> 1463.52
that are part of it

1466.4 --> 1471.1200000000001
but firefox is pretty sure they are

1469.36 --> 1474.9599999999998
definitely separate

1471.12 --> 1474.9599999999998
if i don't think they've been bought up

1475.2 --> 1480.24
by chrome but

1478.24 --> 1481.279
officially they had kind of announced

1480.24 --> 1483.6
that they would stop

1481.279 --> 1486.0
updating a while back and i don't know

1483.6 --> 1486.799
maybe now it's just a public browser and

1486.0 --> 1489.039
it's

1486.799 --> 1490.32
left to a couple of people that are just

1489.039 --> 1493.44
willing to

1490.32 --> 1497.2
update it for free

1493.44 --> 1497.2
i'm not sure what the situation is

1497.69 --> 1501.8400000000001
[Music]

1498.84 --> 1501.84
huh

1516.799 --> 1521.76
ah oh you were on vacation where

1525.84 --> 1531.1999999999998
oh it's the last day yeah end of august

1532.96 --> 1537.279
i hope you enjoyed yourself and your i

1536.24 --> 1538.88
hope you because

1537.279 --> 1540.72
yeah you shared that you also had a

1538.88 --> 1543.44
couple of back issues i hope you're

1540.72 --> 1543.919
over them as well i think a lot of

1543.44 --> 1546.799
people

1543.919 --> 1547.3600000000001
that have typically those issues all

1546.799 --> 1549.52
headed

1547.36 --> 1550.799
at the same time it is really an energy

1549.52 --> 1554.32
thing

1550.799 --> 1558.559
i think that triggers such

1554.32 --> 1558.559
such conditions ah you're in italy all

1565.83 --> 1571.84
[Music]

1568.84 --> 1571.84
right

1574.559 --> 1582.72
right anyway whoa already halfway

1579.2 --> 1585.1200000000001
it's kind of funny though you know that

1582.72 --> 1586.48
it is a lot fresher and i think i'm a

1585.12 --> 1589.6
lot smoother today

1586.48 --> 1592.72
i haven't had like tiredness or

1589.6 --> 1599.84
silent moments really i feel a little

1592.72 --> 1599.84
less tired than average as well

1600.72 --> 1603.679
oh oh yeah

1604.88 --> 1614.67
oh no yeah i met a girl yesterday uh

1612.559 --> 1615.84
a neighbor from downstairs

1614.67 --> 1618.96
[Music]

1615.84 --> 1618.9599999999998
she was really cute

1621.12 --> 1626.3999999999999
she had a lot of logos radiating from

1624.48 --> 1630.48
her like

1626.4 --> 1632.24
she didn't have like all kinds of yeah

1630.48 --> 1633.919
bad things going on in the back of her

1632.24 --> 1638.4
mind she was very serene i

1633.919 --> 1638.4
like that so i don't know

1639.44 --> 1642.72
she even yeah she had some issues with

1642.159 --> 1646.48
the

1642.72 --> 1648.159
leak like her ceiling was

1646.48 --> 1649.84
had been leaking and she was worried

1648.159 --> 1650.48
about she didn't know where it came from

1649.84 --> 1652.48
and i

1650.48 --> 1653.6
basically let her in the house to check

1652.48 --> 1657.919
it see how it is

1653.6 --> 1657.9189999999999
she showed me her room and all that

1658.159 --> 1663.44
so yeah she didn't feel any objection to

1661.2 --> 1668.96
that

1663.44 --> 1671.52
and right i don't know she sounded like

1668.96 --> 1671.52
a really

1671.6 --> 1678.08
responsible girl

1674.96 --> 1678.08
from a good family

1678.159 --> 1683.679
i don't know if she's christian i think

1680.08 --> 1685.52
she's probably coming from

1683.679 --> 1686.96
people that are not anti-christian at

1685.52 --> 1689.36
least

1686.96 --> 1690.08
just yeah that has a certain feel i

1689.36 --> 1695.4399999999998
don't know

1690.08 --> 1695.4399999999998
love is in here well with me you know

1695.6 --> 1700.48
i don't know i just i was really

1698.88 --> 1704.0800000000002
impressed

1700.48 --> 1705.3600000000001
it was like she is very nice i i would

1704.08 --> 1708.72
not mind that

1705.36 --> 1711.36
and she was not extremely young

1708.72 --> 1713.1200000000001
i think she was in her 20s somewhere i

1711.36 --> 1714.32
don't know i didn't ask it's very weird

1713.12 --> 1717.58
to ask that but i did

1714.32 --> 1718.8799999999999
ask her name ilsa

1717.58 --> 1720.1589999999999
[Music]

1718.88 --> 1724.5590000000002
i don't know i don't know what she

1720.159 --> 1727.6000000000001
thinks about me

1724.559 --> 1730.96
but i'm pretty sure she did take notice

1727.6 --> 1733.039
that yeah that i thought she was cute

1730.96 --> 1735.2
not that i like piled it on top but i

1733.039 --> 1737.84
just like yeah

1735.2 --> 1739.44
i like i don't know that's this instinct

1737.84 --> 1741.9189999999999
thing you know and then

1739.44 --> 1744.159
this instinct that really emphasized how

1741.919 --> 1746.96
much of a distance somebody is away

1744.159 --> 1747.7600000000002
i don't know i thought she was cute i

1746.96 --> 1749.8400000000001
didn't

1747.76 --> 1750.8799999999999
like blurt it all out or do something

1749.84 --> 1753.9189999999999
stupid

1750.88 --> 1757.1200000000001
i just showed her that

1753.919 --> 1759.5200000000002
that i'm a very responsible person and

1757.12 --> 1759.52
that i'm

1763.039 --> 1768.8799999999999
that i take care of others too

1766.399 --> 1770.4799999999998
and yeah i don't know you know it's just

1768.88 --> 1773.6000000000001
one day and

1770.48 --> 1775.679
now i'm not gonna like let myself fall

1773.6 --> 1777.039
in love and get all spirally over this

1775.679 --> 1778.96
nonsense and then

1777.039 --> 1781.679
completely forget about it i'm just

1778.96 --> 1784.799
gonna put it in the back of my mind and

1781.679 --> 1787.919
see if i meet her again and maybe

1784.799 --> 1789.44
if the energy is right i'll just go down

1787.919 --> 1792.96
and see if she's there and then ask like

1789.44 --> 1792.96
hey you wanna you know

1793.279 --> 1796.72
get a drink on my balcony or something

1795.36 --> 1797.279
it has to be good weather for that

1796.72 --> 1799.279
though so

1797.279 --> 1802.08
it might take a while for something like

1799.279 --> 1804.88
that to arrive i don't know

1802.08 --> 1805.6
but i'm not gonna make too much out of

1804.88 --> 1809.6000000000001
it but

1805.6 --> 1811.12
yeah you know meeting a girl face to

1809.6 --> 1814.799
face unexpectedly

1811.12 --> 1817.52
and yeah

1814.799 --> 1820.08
it made an impression because it doesn't

1817.52 --> 1821.9189999999999
really happen that often with me i don't

1820.08 --> 1824.48
deal with a lot of people face to face

1821.919 --> 1824.48
that often

1833.44 --> 1837.76
anyway let's move on she sounds great

1837.12 --> 1841.6789999999999
well she

1837.76 --> 1844.0
she was a she is a typical dutch

1841.679 --> 1844.0
girl

1844.96 --> 1851.52
like a natural blonde i think like a

1847.84 --> 1854.9599999999998
really light blonde

1851.52 --> 1857.679
if i remember correctly as she's not

1854.96 --> 1859.44
like a natural white haired as much you

1857.679 --> 1860.96
have those as well like really in the

1859.44 --> 1864.24
north of the netherlands

1860.96 --> 1866.799
freeze land and all that but she just

1864.24 --> 1871.36
seemed very typically dutch like that

1866.799 --> 1871.36
with a very i say uh

1871.44 --> 1878.799
condensed frequency type spirit like

1874.64 --> 1880.96
a very rich spirit not hollow

1878.799 --> 1882.24
very yeah just i don't know i like that

1880.96 --> 1884.24
i have that too i

1882.24 --> 1886.559
that's where i come from it's like it

1884.24 --> 1888.159
feels like oh this is

1886.559 --> 1890.559
you could do something with that

1888.159 --> 1893.8400000000001
something real

1890.559 --> 1893.84
i don't know

1894.399 --> 1897.4399999999998
because yeah there's there's also girls

1896.799 --> 1899.84
that

1897.44 --> 1900.799
physically are like that but that are

1899.84 --> 1904.0
just like

1900.799 --> 1906.72
vacated like they don't even look

1904.0 --> 1908.64
out of their eyes really they just stare

1906.72 --> 1910.559
a lot or something or they

1908.64 --> 1912.3990000000001
they don't know how to act this girl had

1910.559 --> 1915.2
no problem

1912.399 --> 1915.1999999999998
with any of that

1918.559 --> 1923.519
like she felt a future for herself

1921.76 --> 1925.279
i know sounds kind of weird right but i

1923.519 --> 1927.919
could just by the by her

1925.279 --> 1929.039
attitude by her stance she had

1927.919 --> 1934.88
confidence

1929.039 --> 1938.799
in her own future at least no

1934.88 --> 1938.7990000000002
that is also very appealing to me

1946.84 --> 1949.84
hmm

1951.84 --> 1955.12
good servant don't worry about it

1956.32 --> 1962.0
i'm not nervous well

1959.919 --> 1963.919
yeah no not nervous you know nervous is

1962.0 --> 1965.039
when you have energy and you don't know

1963.919 --> 1967.519
what to do with it

1965.039 --> 1968.64
i was just exhilarated it was kind of

1967.519 --> 1972.0
weird because

1968.64 --> 1973.44
i had just done groceries and i always

1972.0 --> 1975.2
get energetic so it was

1973.44 --> 1977.1200000000001
like i was sweating a lot and that was

1975.2 --> 1979.039
kind of weird i wasn't nervous but i was

1977.12 --> 1982.559
sweating a lot because it was just

1979.039 --> 1985.44
i had just basically done workouts

1982.559 --> 1988.0
but she didn't seem to like be repulsed

1985.44 --> 1988.0
or anything

1989.12 --> 1993.84
maybe it wasn't that bad maybe i just

1990.96 --> 2005.8400000000001
felt really sweaty

1993.84 --> 2005.84
i don't know doesn't really matter

2008.08 --> 2018.24
what code white

2011.2 --> 2021.8400000000001
keywords what what does that mean

2018.24 --> 2021.84
yeah i was wearing all black

2022.799 --> 2026.399
i didn't have my white shirt on

2027.919 --> 2034.64
she didn't seem to mind that either

2032.96 --> 2036.08
maybe she thought it was kind of

2034.64 --> 2039.6000000000001
interesting i don't know

2036.08 --> 2043.76
i shouldn't constantly try to divine

2039.6 --> 2046.6399999999999
that [ __ ] this is i'm not going to

2043.76 --> 2047.84
and you're not going to make me because

2046.64 --> 2050.879
i know it's not

2047.84 --> 2050.879
useful you know

2052.879 --> 2057.7599999999998
it was meant to be it was meant to be

2055.76 --> 2060.0
could just as well be that i don't know

2057.76 --> 2061.8390000000004
in a period i'll i'll bump into her

2060.0 --> 2063.359
again and she'll be completely different

2061.839 --> 2066.399
who knows

2063.359 --> 2070.48
you you don't know so i

2066.399 --> 2074.3199999999997
shouldn't set all my hopes on something

2070.48 --> 2075.679
in such a preliminary stage but it's

2074.32 --> 2079.44
yeah i'm just going to take it as a

2075.679 --> 2079.44
pleasant experience hey amanda young

2083.599 --> 2089.839
right tom parker just let it happen i am

2108.96 --> 2115.119
invite around for dinner yeah

2112.32 --> 2117.839
yeah i said at some point i i may try

2115.119 --> 2117.839
that

2118.24 --> 2122.0
but yeah before i do that i first wanna

2121.2 --> 2125.1189999999997
see if

2122.0 --> 2127.68
yeah just i know come over for it for a

2125.119 --> 2131.359
drink or whatever

2127.68 --> 2134.56
and first i'm gonna hear her out about

2131.359 --> 2136.72
her food habits and then see

2134.56 --> 2140.48
what a good dinner would be tonight no

2136.72 --> 2140.48
way shitty weather tonight

2141.76 --> 2144.96
and besides i also have to do my

2143.44 --> 2148.48
newspaper rounds i'm going to be too

2144.96 --> 2151.76
busy for that and it's too quick

2148.48 --> 2155.04
is it i don't know

2151.76 --> 2157.3590000000004
look if i bump into her today

2155.04 --> 2159.92
then hey if i'm going to bump into her

2157.359 --> 2163.359
i'm gonna talk to her no matter what

2159.92 --> 2173.839
i've decided upon that i'm just gonna

2163.359 --> 2173.839
walk past her

2177.92 --> 2182.32
don't let someone else move in on her or

2180.72 --> 2184.3199999999997
if someone else could move

2182.32 --> 2186.32
in on her thanks a lot by the way tom

2184.32 --> 2188.079
parker thanks a lot for

2186.32 --> 2189.599
sewing some fear in there that's just

2188.079 --> 2193.119
great man

2189.599 --> 2194.0
uh look if she's gonna go for somebody

2193.119 --> 2195.839
else

2194.0 --> 2198.32
then that somebody else is very unlikely

2195.839 --> 2201.119
to be me if she would go for that

2198.32 --> 2203.119
that means that i may have overestimated

2201.119 --> 2208.32
her in the first place

2203.119 --> 2208.32
so yeah

2211.52 --> 2218.16
but again i'm not gonna

2214.96 --> 2218.16
just talk about her

2223.599 --> 2230.079
going strong no look this is not some

2226.96 --> 2233.839
open for a business socializing girl

2230.079 --> 2237.119
this is not like a hot girl that's like

2233.839 --> 2242.0
ready to get it on no this is a very

2237.119 --> 2244.2400000000002
modest civilized girl that's like

2242.0 --> 2245.76
i don't know she gave me the feeling

2244.24 --> 2248.4799999999996
that she's into family

2245.76 --> 2249.0400000000004
you know it's very different those types

2248.48 --> 2252.4
don't

2249.04 --> 2257.839
get it on like very quickly

2252.4 --> 2257.839
and i like that

2266.48 --> 2270.32
you know that's it i'm not here to score

2269.839 --> 2273.119
you know

2270.32 --> 2274.2400000000002
if i'd be here to score yeah i'd be able

2273.119 --> 2276.7200000000003
to screw

2274.24 --> 2278.72
two girls on a night probably but that

2276.72 --> 2281.68
be disgusting

2278.72 --> 2282.7999999999997
ugh no now that might have appealed to

2281.68 --> 2286.0
me 20 years ago

2282.8 --> 2287.8390000000004
it definitely doesn't these days

2286.0 --> 2289.839
because of the types because of the type

2287.839 --> 2293.359
of women that do that and they rub

2289.839 --> 2296.72
off on you quite literally so no

2293.359 --> 2298.4
no i'm looking for a wife not just gonna

2296.72 --> 2301.52
say that

2298.4 --> 2303.2000000000003
but it is like i don't want to screw

2301.52 --> 2313.839
around anymore i want

2303.2 --> 2313.839
a wife and if possible kids

2318.32 --> 2328.88
right i'm good for you good servant

2326.72 --> 2330.9599999999996
i'm not gonna give up on relationships

2328.88 --> 2334.32
but i'm just going to

2330.96 --> 2334.32
approach it differently

2335.04 --> 2339.119
i'm looking more for a homesteading

2336.88 --> 2341.359
situation set up

2339.119 --> 2342.56
it this is the netherlands of course so

2341.359 --> 2345.52
it's different

2342.56 --> 2345.52
it's like in the us

2346.079 --> 2349.92
but that's what i'm looking for i don't

2348.4 --> 2355.76
know i don't know

2349.92 --> 2357.92
we'll see just ah

2355.76 --> 2360.88
hope to maybe have some conversation

2357.92 --> 2360.88
like that with her

2362.56 --> 2366.48
i don't even know what she studies look

2364.64 --> 2367.92
if she's living there in like this room

2366.48 --> 2369.92
with other women

2367.92 --> 2371.52
she is doing a study here somewhere i

2369.92 --> 2374.32
don't even know what it is

2371.52 --> 2374.32
you know it

2375.599 --> 2381.6800000000003
i just hope it's something useful

2378.8 --> 2383.599
it probably is but yeah you never really

2381.68 --> 2384.96
know it might be geology or something i

2383.599 --> 2387.28
don't know

2384.96 --> 2389.68
i couldn't make it up from what i saw in

2387.28 --> 2392.5600000000004
her room

2389.68 --> 2393.52
maybe she's into art what she didn't

2392.56 --> 2396.96
show maybe

2393.52 --> 2399.52
it's more something basic more technical

2396.96 --> 2399.52
i don't know

2404.56 --> 2411.2799999999997
stop talking about her and that's

2406.96 --> 2414.319
talking to myself

2411.28 --> 2416.96
oh god being single for over five years

2414.319 --> 2416.96
is terrible

2417.599 --> 2427.92
[ __ ] six years actually jesus

2424.88 --> 2429.599
maybe she's watching

2427.92 --> 2432.48
or if she would be watching that would

2429.599 --> 2432.48
be kind of silly

2432.8 --> 2438.69
to me and i'd probably notice

2435.92 --> 2440.8
the next time i see her she'd be like

2438.69 --> 2443.68
[Music]

2440.8 --> 2445.92
i don't know i don't know who's watching

2443.68 --> 2447.68
me i don't know how well people know

2445.92 --> 2450.88
that i have a show and actually checked

2447.68 --> 2450.8799999999997
it out you know

2450.96 --> 2455.2
because there's a lot of people doing a

2452.88 --> 2458.6400000000003
lot of shows also in the netherlands

2455.2 --> 2461.2799999999997
and there's just a lot of crap god

2458.64 --> 2464.0789999999997
people are so wasting everyone's time

2461.28 --> 2465.6800000000003
and with what they do online

2464.079 --> 2468.7200000000003
oh and i can already hear all the

2465.68 --> 2470.64
ballers squirting in the background now

2468.72 --> 2472.0
look who's talking you're wasting every

2470.64 --> 2475.2
one time yeah but

2472.0 --> 2478.079
at least i'm bringing information to the

2475.2 --> 2478.0789999999997
table at least i'm

2478.839 --> 2484.64
articulating

2481.119 --> 2487.6800000000003
you don't advertise what do you mean

2484.64 --> 2487.68
i don't advertise

2488.16 --> 2493.1189999999997
i look i represent

2491.28 --> 2495.8390000000004
and somebody asks me what do you do and

2493.119 --> 2495.839
say well i'm

2496.0 --> 2503.52
i'm a youtuber i have a daily show

2500.24 --> 2504.24
and i have followers and they even help

2503.52 --> 2507.359
me

2504.24 --> 2508.0
help maintain me financially and i'm

2507.359 --> 2511.5989999999997
effectively

2508.0 --> 2513.68
a teacher and then i say i'm a

2511.599 --> 2515.28
cosmogenist and that's when things get

2513.68 --> 2516.0789999999997
weird because then people are like oh

2515.28 --> 2519.28
what

2516.079 --> 2522.46
what is that and then yeah

2519.28 --> 2524.2400000000002
then i test how much they can handle

2522.46 --> 2527.76
[Music]

2524.24 --> 2527.7599999999998
haven't gotten to that point yet

2547.76 --> 2553.76
i have that i could put up only act i

2550.96 --> 2556.16
know is just being myself

2553.76 --> 2558.5600000000004
and yeah that being myself can be very

2556.16 --> 2558.56
nervous

2559.599 --> 2565.839
or just not very nervous that's the only

2562.24 --> 2565.839
ways i can act

2580.4 --> 2583.44
right anyway uh

2587.68 --> 2593.839
your wrench is getting rusty well

2596.72 --> 2607.839
just give it a polish

2608.88 --> 2615.44
yeah but it is kind of silly though

2612.319 --> 2621.839
you guys have been noticing right that

2615.44 --> 2621.839
there's a lot about what

2632.8 --> 2640.2400000000002
sorry tom parker i got this

2637.04 --> 2640.24
got to ban people

2643.52 --> 2649.599
now it's just people that

2646.56 --> 2651.2
that don't have any input

2649.599 --> 2653.3590000000004
that are just trying to waste people's

2651.2 --> 2657.839
time

2653.359 --> 2657.839
yeah that's right flat earth destroyer

2658.72 --> 2663.2
yeah density isn't a force that's

2660.839 --> 2666.0
correct

2663.2 --> 2667.04
yeah but you know what is a force though

2666.0 --> 2671.359
it is

2667.04 --> 2671.359
relative density disequilibrium

2671.44 --> 2678.2400000000002
when something separate

2675.04 --> 2678.96
or contained as an average density that

2678.24 --> 2681.68
is higher

2678.96 --> 2683.2
than the density of the medium that

2681.68 --> 2686.319
surrounds it

2683.2 --> 2688.7999999999997
then a force will literally provably

2686.319 --> 2690.96
scientifically provably come into being

2688.8 --> 2692.6400000000003
and cause displacement

2690.96 --> 2694.4
if it has maneuvering room and if it

2692.64 --> 2696.0
doesn't have maneuvering room that force

2694.4 --> 2698.96
will be translated instead of

2696.0 --> 2703.2
motion into pressure it's provably so

2698.96 --> 2707.76
relative density disequilibrium

2703.2 --> 2707.7599999999998
is causes force

2708.64 --> 2714.24
it's a fact and it goes in both

2711.839 --> 2717.52
directions

2714.24 --> 2719.839
and gravity is

2717.52 --> 2719.839
look

2720.64 --> 2725.68
gravity is not a force and people that

2724.24 --> 2728.72
keep calling it a force

2725.68 --> 2730.48
are continually making official mistakes

2728.72 --> 2733.2
because it's not a force

2730.48 --> 2733.92
i know it's very popular to think of it

2733.2 --> 2736.56
as a force

2733.92 --> 2736.56
but it's not

2738.4 --> 2743.839
so yeah you can keep asserting that but

2741.359 --> 2747.44
it's not going to help your case though

2743.839 --> 2750.56
what is a force however is relative

2747.44 --> 2752.7200000000003
density disequilibrium

2750.56 --> 2755.2799999999997
you can prove that you can test it

2752.72 --> 2755.2799999999997
yourself

2756.8 --> 2762.2400000000002
if it's not a force what is it well

2758.8 --> 2762.2400000000002
officially it's an effect

2762.88 --> 2767.44
it's not the force it's an effect oh

2765.76 --> 2771.3590000000004
that's not helping you

2767.44 --> 2773.92
it's not helping you say that makes it

2771.359 --> 2775.04
less comprehensible yeah you got a good

2773.92 --> 2777.119
point there

2775.04 --> 2778.88
well maybe you should approach it

2777.119 --> 2782.1600000000003
differently and just consider

2778.88 --> 2785.119
that there is no gravity that it's

2782.16 --> 2785.1189999999997
science fiction

2785.44 --> 2789.119
that would help a lot i'd like to stick

2788.0 --> 2791.92
to things that

2789.119 --> 2794.319
can actually be proven and then figure

2791.92 --> 2796.64
out how that works

2794.319 --> 2799.04
and then use that like relative density

2796.64 --> 2800.64
disequilibrium force a provable force

2799.04 --> 2804.319
demonstratable

2800.64 --> 2804.319
repeatable scientific

2805.04 --> 2810.48
gravity not so much unless you can

2808.079 --> 2812.8
figure out how the bending of space

2810.48 --> 2812.8
time

2814.16 --> 2817.359
is gravity and what that means if you

2816.88 --> 2820.7200000000003
can

2817.359 --> 2821.7599999999998
translate that to the actual 3d real

2820.72 --> 2824.319
world

2821.76 --> 2825.8390000000004
in some way that would be interesting

2824.319 --> 2827.7599999999998
but i bet

2825.839 --> 2828.96
that yeah whatever story you're gonna

2827.76 --> 2833.92
come up with

2828.96 --> 2839.2
doesn't actually tie into official

2833.92 --> 2839.2000000000003
official physics concerning it

2839.28 --> 2845.0400000000004
it's just going to be your story because

2841.839 --> 2848.0789999999997
there is no solution

2845.04 --> 2851.2
bending of space-time

2848.079 --> 2854.0
as official gravity was never meant

2851.2 --> 2854.8799999999997
to be solved it was meant to create a

2854.0 --> 2857.599
dead end

2854.88 --> 2858.48
in something the gravity and you know

2857.599 --> 2861.119
why

2858.48 --> 2863.52
because it doesn't exist and they had to

2861.119 --> 2866.079
halt it they had to

2863.52 --> 2868.72
drive it into the ditch and then let the

2866.079 --> 2870.88
people figure it out

2868.72 --> 2872.16
because they couldn't continue on making

2870.88 --> 2874.2400000000002
it a foundation

2872.16 --> 2875.68
of their even of their astronom

2874.24 --> 2877.4399999999996
astronomy modeling

2875.68 --> 2879.52
and it's not really necessary for it

2877.44 --> 2882.0
anyway there's plenty of

2879.52 --> 2884.4
universe models that do not include

2882.0 --> 2887.119
gravity at all

2884.4 --> 2889.04
is enforce accelerated mass yeah yeah

2887.119 --> 2891.92
yeah it is

2889.04 --> 2891.92
that that's fine

2894.559 --> 2897.8390000000004
right and relative density this

2896.559 --> 2901.28
equilibrium

2897.839 --> 2905.92
does accelerate the mass

2901.28 --> 2908.1600000000003
or the object the material

2905.92 --> 2909.119
it does relative density this

2908.16 --> 2912.72
equilibrium

2909.119 --> 2915.839
is a force it causes an acceleration

2912.72 --> 2915.839
that's right

2916.64 --> 2919.7599999999998
it's not gravity though

2921.599 --> 2926.0
because gravity is not a force

2924.48 --> 2927.68
officially

2926.0 --> 2930.4
you don't know what it is because

2927.68 --> 2933.2799999999997
bending of space-time does not

2930.4 --> 2934.48
tie into anything that is real so it

2933.28 --> 2936.2400000000002
isn't anything

2934.48 --> 2937.839
now you can get all fussy about that all

2936.24 --> 2940.24
day long

2937.839 --> 2942.24
i instead like to just divert the

2940.24 --> 2943.68
attention away from gravity to something

2942.24 --> 2945.4399999999996
that can be proven

2943.68 --> 2946.8799999999997
which is relative density this

2945.44 --> 2949.359
equilibrium force

2946.88 --> 2951.92
now there's a force it is a force

2949.359 --> 2951.92
provably

2955.2 --> 2961.52
no you're not listening great circle and

2958.48 --> 2962.48
you don't need a citation i am the

2961.52 --> 2965.2
citation

2962.48 --> 2967.839
density doesn't cause acceleration no

2965.2 --> 2970.0
you're misquoting me

2967.839 --> 2971.68
if you're gonna do that again i'm going

2970.0 --> 2974.96
to ban you

2971.68 --> 2979.68
relative relative

2974.96 --> 2982.88
density this equilibrium

2979.68 --> 2984.16
causes acceleration not density density

2982.88 --> 2986.88
doesn't do anything

2984.16 --> 2987.7599999999998
it's always the relation the density of

2986.88 --> 2989.6800000000003
material

2987.76 --> 2991.599
in relation to the density of its

2989.68 --> 2996.72
surroundings

2991.599 --> 2999.839
that is it equation you say yeah no

2996.72 --> 3002.64
no their equations don't matter

2999.839 --> 3003.44
only thing that matters is physical

3002.64 --> 3007.52
repeatable

3003.44 --> 3009.28
testability you can do it yourself

3007.52 --> 3010.64
and hey if you want to put it into an

3009.28 --> 3014.3190000000004
equation that's fine

3010.64 --> 3016.64
you know tony sleeping warrior and me

3014.319 --> 3019.04
have done that

3016.64 --> 3021.04
you know just on the spot it's not that

3019.04 --> 3022.64
difficult to do it you just say okay you

3021.04 --> 3024.72
have the density

3022.64 --> 3025.68
the medium you have the density of the

3024.72 --> 3029.04
object

3025.68 --> 3032.64
you uh you call that

3029.04 --> 3035.599
you divide one through the other

3032.64 --> 3037.52
and then the result will show you

3035.599 --> 3038.48
whether it's going to go up or going to

3037.52 --> 3041.839
go down

3038.48 --> 3043.44
and how fast you could probably even

3041.839 --> 3046.96
calculate that

3043.44 --> 3050.2400000000002
if you sharpen it out sharpen it further

3046.96 --> 3051.119
but it is a division equation that is

3050.24 --> 3056.0789999999997
the relative

3051.119 --> 3058.319
density system it's a division equation

3056.079 --> 3060.8390000000004
so you can express it in math but it's

3058.319 --> 3062.72
not necessary not necessary for

3060.839 --> 3064.0789999999997
experimentation scientific

3062.72 --> 3068.0
experimentation

3064.079 --> 3071.2000000000003
all it requires is a clear

3068.0 --> 3073.92
cause of the effect that you can very

3071.2 --> 3073.9199999999996
manipulate

3074.0 --> 3080.72
you you can alter it and then prove or

3077.44 --> 3084.88
disprove the hypothesis

3080.72 --> 3086.8799999999997
and you can everybody can do it it's

3084.88 --> 3089.04
been demonstrated you can demonstrate it

3086.88 --> 3090.96
to yourself in many many ways figure out

3089.04 --> 3093.119
many different setups

3090.96 --> 3094.8
to do it over and over and over again in

3093.119 --> 3098.4
many different ways and figure out that

3094.8 --> 3098.4
it is very persistent

3098.559 --> 3101.599
nobody's disproving it yet people been

3100.4 --> 3105.6800000000003
trying to [ __ ]

3101.599 --> 3109.92
disprove it by misinterpreting it

3105.68 --> 3111.52
nobody has disproved relative density

3109.92 --> 3114.4
theory

3111.52 --> 3114.4
proven theory

3120.48 --> 3126.0
no it doesn't flat earth destroyer

3123.68 --> 3127.5989999999997
cavendish is not an experiment it did

3126.0 --> 3131.8
not prove mass attracts

3127.599 --> 3133.599
mass no it calculated from based on

3131.8 --> 3136.319
presuppositions

3133.599 --> 3138.319
the weight of the earth it didn't even

3136.319 --> 3141.24
prove mass attracting mass

3138.319 --> 3144.16
it's a total science fiction

3141.24 --> 3147.52
misinterpretation on purpose it's there

3144.16 --> 3150.72
for people to latch onto this illusion

3147.52 --> 3153.359
that somehow there is a force gravity

3150.72 --> 3153.7599999999998
of mass attracting mass which there is

3153.359 --> 3155.2
no

3153.76 --> 3157.28
proof for this there's not even an

3155.2 --> 3160.64
official hypothesis for this

3157.28 --> 3161.28
do you understand there's no hypothesis

3160.64 --> 3167.839
for mass

3161.28 --> 3167.8390000000004
attracting mass it doesn't exist

3178.839 --> 3183.94
hmm

3180.89 --> 3183.94
[Music]

3185.2 --> 3187.839
yeah i have

3190.24 --> 3194.16
yeah conservation of momentum is not

3192.839 --> 3199.839
mass

3194.16 --> 3199.839
as a false equation it's one or the

3206.839 --> 3209.839
other

3214.96 --> 3218.559
no no rector stefan helderson that's

3217.68 --> 3221.9199999999996
ridiculous

3218.559 --> 3224.48
gravity doesn't exist don't care where

3221.92 --> 3224.48
it fits

3225.92 --> 3241.44
science fiction

3237.52 --> 3244.319
all right so it's uh

3241.44 --> 3244.319
done with your [ __ ]

3247.92 --> 3251.2000000000003
you can come back tomorrow what is

3250.319 --> 3253.2799999999997
gravity

3251.2 --> 3254.8799999999997
it's nothing it doesn't exist it's

3253.28 --> 3256.6400000000003
science fiction

3254.88 --> 3258.4
it's officially the beginning of space

3256.64 --> 3260.0
time which is

3258.4 --> 3261.92
something that's supposed to happen in a

3260.0 --> 3265.04
conceptual medium

3261.92 --> 3265.599
it's not proven people don't even know

3265.04 --> 3267.7599999999998
what it

3265.599 --> 3269.28
means when you try to translate it into

3267.76 --> 3272.599
physical reality

3269.28 --> 3274.6400000000003
there is no confirmation any

3272.599 --> 3276.88
conceptualization of what gravity is

3274.64 --> 3278.799
supposed to be in physical reality

3276.88 --> 3280.2400000000002
based on pseudo-romanian force-based

3278.799 --> 3283.28
einsteinian gravity

3280.24 --> 3286.24
it does not exist get the [ __ ]

3283.28 --> 3287.599
over it it doesn't exist it's only

3286.24 --> 3290.0
stories people made up

3287.599 --> 3290.839
none of it has been confirmed your

3290.0 --> 3294.16
complete

3290.839 --> 3298.319
retards for constantly

3294.16 --> 3303.7599999999998
pursuing that [ __ ] it doesn't exist

3298.319 --> 3303.7599999999998
it's pseudo exactly good servant

3305.68 --> 3311.68
gravity is a concept it doesn't exist

3308.24 --> 3321.839
there is no proof there is no hypothesis

3311.68 --> 3321.839
it doesn't exist it's science fiction

3328.319 --> 3332.72
oh look who's that yeah yeah yeah now

3331.68 --> 3335.839
you're banned

3332.72 --> 3335.839
now you're just banned

3337.92 --> 3341.92
yeah nobody you're not gonna suck on me

3340.16 --> 3344.319
that means you're banned for life

3341.92 --> 3344.319
all of it

3347.28 --> 3353.8390000000004
yeah i already did that

3350.48 --> 3353.839
janice gustavian

3353.92 --> 3358.88
lack of gravity why do objects fall yeah

3356.48 --> 3361.599
relative density disequilibrium

3358.88 --> 3362.6400000000003
is why objects fall the density of an

3361.599 --> 3364.6400000000003
object

3362.64 --> 3365.68
is more dense than the medium that

3364.64 --> 3369.7599999999998
surrounds it a

3365.68 --> 3373.1189999999997
force will be subjected to that body

3369.76 --> 3376.3190000000004
in order for it to find an equilibrium

3373.119 --> 3379.2000000000003
with its medium

3376.319 --> 3380.72
if it's denser it will start to

3379.2 --> 3382.0
accelerate down as long as there's

3380.72 --> 3383.839
maneuvering room

3382.0 --> 3385.04
and otherwise it will translate into

3383.839 --> 3387.52
pressure

3385.04 --> 3388.16
if it's less dense than the surroundings

3387.52 --> 3390.48
it will do

3388.16 --> 3393.04
exactly the same thing in the opposite

3390.48 --> 3393.04
direction

3393.359 --> 3399.119
that's relative density disequilibrium

3396.96 --> 3400.319
force it's a force causes an

3399.119 --> 3402.079
acceleration

3400.319 --> 3403.52
and if there's no maneuvering room it

3402.079 --> 3406.559
causes a pressure

3403.52 --> 3409.2
locally to that which is stopping the

3406.559 --> 3411.2000000000003
maneuvering

3409.2 --> 3412.64
because it still is in this equilibrium

3411.2 --> 3416.319
and it still wants to go

3412.64 --> 3418.24
to an equilibrium point and if it's less

3416.319 --> 3422.88
dense that equilibrium point will

3418.24 --> 3425.2
always be upward and if it's denser

3422.88 --> 3427.839
than its medium then that equilibrium

3425.2 --> 3431.5989999999997
point will always be downward

3427.839 --> 3434.64
and if it's equal to the medium

3431.599 --> 3436.88
then it won't go anywhere it'll stay

i need financial ammo against the

ballers

3512.64 --> 3516.0789999999997

3523.04 --> 3527.04
they're all just misled and they just

3525.2 --> 3531.2799999999997
they're looking

3527.04 --> 3534.24
for a way out that they can work with

3531.28 --> 3536.079
and they have to figure out what it is

3534.24 --> 3537.2
that is their real way out and it takes

3536.079 --> 3538.88
a lot of time

3537.2 --> 3541.839
to get over their conditioning and their

3538.88 --> 3544.96
misconceptions that are being fed

3541.839 --> 3548.5589999999997
