152.34 --> 155.84
so Hayes over there

157.68 --> 161.09900000000002
but I don't know it doesn't look too

159.48 --> 163.5
unnatural

161.099 --> 165.42
so it's probably still like from the

163.5 --> 168.2
same thing that was causing these storms

165.42 --> 168.2
yesterday because

168.42 --> 172.73899999999998
yeah yesterday

170.22 --> 175.76
became like a really

172.739 --> 179.64000000000001
interesting looking day outside but

175.76 --> 181.85999999999999
massive clouds like super black that

179.64 --> 185.33999999999997
literally had like lightning come out of

181.86 --> 189.42000000000002
them in midday well the the rest of the

185.34 --> 193.26
air would be super clear blue

189.42 --> 196.379
already so and yeah pretty magnificent

193.26 --> 199.019
spectacle I shared some of it in the

196.379 --> 201.42
recording of the app to show

199.019 --> 203.58
through my webcam but

201.42 --> 205.319
yeah right now it's just really

203.58 --> 209.09900000000002
beautiful

205.319 --> 211.85999999999999
like I actually cleaned this window

209.099 --> 215.099
just so I can have this perfect

211.86 --> 217.98000000000002
Clear View

215.099 --> 220.64

217.98 --> 220.64
the Sun

221.159 --> 225.35999999999999
Clear Blue Skies

223.5 --> 226.81
and it's really nice and pleasant

225.36 --> 236.169
outside

226.81 --> 236.169
[Music]

238.2 --> 244.2

244.2 --> 247.67999999999998
PJ CNET

245.78 --> 250.22
[Music]

247.68 --> 250.22
welcome

250.92 --> 256.8
it is Thursday the 29th of September

254.22 --> 259.989
2022.

256.8 --> 259.98900000000003
[Music]

260.94 --> 266.4
well don't know how much of you guys

263.58 --> 268.68
paid attention on yesterday's stream and

266.4 --> 270.65999999999997
there's one before we've just made a

268.68 --> 275.34000000000003
couple of remarks but it turns out that

270.66 --> 276.59000000000003
my suspicion my dark suspicion was true

275.34 --> 278.479
foreign

276.59 --> 282.86999999999995
[Music]

278.479 --> 286.919
minister is actually out left

282.87 --> 290.72
[Music]

286.919 --> 290.71999999999997
show you the proof

293.34 --> 299.71999999999997
I think this is gonna like

295.8 --> 299.72
have really unexpected

300.12 --> 307.1
effect I mean

303.06 --> 307.1
she literally exposed herself

307.5 --> 311.96
with a stupid tweet and

329.37 --> 332.569
[Music]

333.419 --> 340.15999999999997
right here it is

336.24 --> 340.16
yeah sorry about the rest of the [ __ ]

340.259 --> 345.62
uh

342.6 --> 345.62
so yeah

347.699 --> 352.38
she's highly in support of Ukraine

350.8 --> 356.24
[Music]

352.38 --> 356.24
oh freaking goodie

356.58 --> 363.71999999999997
and that's by the way

359.22 --> 365.03900000000004
basically already a uh a 180 degree heel

363.72 --> 369.8
turn

365.039 --> 369.8
from the things that she's been saying

370.919 --> 375.29999999999995
during her campaign and all that which I

373.8 --> 380.28000000000003
personally have not followed but yeah I

375.3 --> 382.979
can follow other people talking about it

380.28 --> 385.52
that we're following the lead up to this

382.979 --> 385.52
and all that

395.52 --> 402.419
you're reading that yeah but the tweet

398.52 --> 404.69899999999996
was not in Dutch Eric Tarot

402.419 --> 407.539
not talking about the blab ring that was

404.699 --> 407.539
around the tweet

411.1 --> 414.68
[Music]

413.039 --> 419.9
I'll just

414.68 --> 419.90000000000003
try again and see if I can isolate it

421.08 --> 425.9
just a bit of a hassle to do that uh

443.24 --> 446.339
[Music]

452.819 --> 460.97900000000004
I could just go to her Twitter

456.78 --> 463.69899999999996
and or just find that stupid tweet

460.979 --> 463.699
although

465.0 --> 470.94
there's a lot of it so

467.88 --> 473.88
I'm browsing until I find that

470.94 --> 477.319
this is all in Italian by the way most

473.88 --> 477.319
of it no no oh here it is

478.38 --> 483.62
okay so yours directly from our Twitter

485.039 --> 487.58
see

493.68 --> 499.86
there's a lensky you know you can count

497.039 --> 502.639
on our L'Oreal support for the cause of

499.86 --> 505.8
freedom of the Ukrainian people

502.639 --> 508.52
stay strong and keep your faith

505.8 --> 508.52000000000004
steadfast

513.24 --> 519.44
so out left

516.479 --> 519.44
part of the plan

522.539 --> 533.269
foreign

523.1 --> 533.269
[Music]

540.26 --> 543.4399999999999
like me

547.58 --> 550.739
[Music]

553.86 --> 556.1
foreign

560.66 --> 564.6
[Music]

565.94 --> 571.86
well it could be a trick

568.8 --> 574.62
I'll give you that but even then

571.86 --> 576.36
that's

574.62 --> 577.86
like

576.36 --> 580.6800000000001
dangerous

577.86 --> 584.64
and it is still put like that means that

580.68 --> 586.9799999999999
she could switch just on a whim

584.64 --> 589.56
if she felt she needed to and just

586.98 --> 592.4590000000001
become part of the B system completely

589.56 --> 592.459
alt left

592.86 --> 597.48
their supposed right wings that's gonna

595.38 --> 599.88
be their tactics

597.48 --> 602.16
but it's all part of a railroaded system

599.88 --> 604.14
that's been pre-built that all of them

602.16 --> 608.76
follow and already heard the telltale

604.14 --> 610.86
signs when a standard go after Muslims

608.76 --> 612.959
and blame them for all the [ __ ] that's

610.86 --> 615.66
happening to them

612.959 --> 617.88
like that has anything to do with actual

615.66 --> 623.279
Muslims

617.88 --> 624.3
right that is a a core trademark of alt

623.279 --> 627.959
left

624.3 --> 629.6999999999999
alt left always does that

627.959 --> 633.3599999999999
yeah

629.7 --> 635.279
you understand how many out there are

633.36 --> 638.04
actually part of that

635.279 --> 640.74
and they always do that

638.04 --> 644.16
always they don't leave that part out

640.74 --> 648.32
Trump did it Trump is all left Alex

644.16 --> 648.3199999999999
Jones founded it

652.5 --> 657.959
yeah and even like a little bit of

654.42 --> 659.88
backtrack but then still he just he uses

657.959 --> 661.0999999999999
that narrative he keeps saying that he

659.88 --> 663.36
keeps

661.1 --> 666.26
reifying it anyway

663.36 --> 666.26
alt left

669.899 --> 673.56
they're like

671.22 --> 674.7
yeah maybe a bit too harsh but I don't

673.56 --> 679.26
know

674.7 --> 679.26
like undercover communists

683.76 --> 687.74
you see it now PJ seen it

689.75 --> 698.049
[Music]

708.3 --> 714.959
yes that's correct

711.48 --> 717.12
so the old left is like a right wing

714.959 --> 719.88
setup

717.12 --> 723.54
that cooperates with the same B system

719.88 --> 725.72
it's just another face of globalism alt

723.54 --> 725.7199999999999
left

726.3 --> 732.079
they just

727.98 --> 732.0790000000001
do business in another formula

737.04 --> 744.26
right but they're gonna be nothing more

740.16 --> 744.26
than a bunch of sparring partners really

745.38 --> 751.079
against the actual globalism factions

753.12 --> 758.76
because they're just part of it

755.579 --> 760.8599999999999
so they're they're taking attaining a

758.76 --> 763.56
role like on the world stage right

760.86 --> 766.0790000000001
they're containing that opposition role

763.56 --> 768.6199999999999
but it's all as controlled as can be

766.079 --> 771.42
because they follow a very specific

768.62 --> 773.16
narrative and they do a very specific

771.42 --> 777.079
type of actions

773.16 --> 777.079
and it's all very predictable

777.36 --> 779.899
right

781.2 --> 787.6
I mean this is such a complicated

785.24 --> 789.72
psychological warfare operation

787.6 --> 790.86
[Music]

789.72 --> 792.779
that

790.86 --> 795.0
I really wonder like how many of these

792.779 --> 796.07
people even realize that they're part of

795.0 --> 799.249
that

796.07 --> 799.249
[Music]

804.98 --> 809.279
or they could just be in so far over

807.66 --> 811.5
their head that they're they're just

809.279 --> 814.079
going they're just doing it and they're

811.5 --> 816.72
just happy they can hold on to that

814.079 --> 819.06
roughly that culture

816.72 --> 820.5
even though it's all gets torn apart

819.06 --> 822.54
anyway

820.5 --> 825.079
because they're still gonna allow that

822.54 --> 825.079
all to happen

826.92 --> 832.9799999999999
I mean how long is it going to take this

830.459 --> 833.88
is this is literally me predicting right

832.98 --> 835.8000000000001
now

833.88 --> 838.1
you think that this is the start of it

835.8 --> 838.0999999999999
right

838.44 --> 844.139
she made so she had she had like this

841.98 --> 846.4200000000001
eternally rambling speech thing going

844.139 --> 847.98
where she would just say thing after

846.42 --> 849.899
thing after thing after thing after

847.98 --> 852.24
thing after thing after things totally

849.899 --> 853.92
scatter gunning with just things that

852.24 --> 857.12
people want to hear

853.92 --> 859.3199999999999
with super Bassy it's a total spell

857.12 --> 862.32
total enchantment

859.32 --> 864.6600000000001
and I didn't even hear I couldn't even

862.32 --> 867.5400000000001
decipher the language and just hearing

864.66 --> 870.24
her do that in Italian immediately made

867.54 --> 871.98
me recognize it your scatter gunning

870.24 --> 874.0790000000001
exactly what they want to hear you're

871.98 --> 876.6
enchanting them

874.079 --> 879.0
because there's no way that you could

876.6 --> 881.399
actually back that

879.0 --> 884.279
you nobody can

881.399 --> 885.24
not when you do it like that it's a

884.279 --> 887.3389999999999
spell

885.24 --> 890.66
I didn't even have to understand the

887.339 --> 890.6600000000001
language to fill that out

890.76 --> 896.3389999999999
so this is just a back track with

893.94 --> 898.62
Ukraine [ __ ] which she promised like get

896.339 --> 902.1600000000001
out of Ukraine and just take care of the

898.62 --> 905.399
country right that's what I presume she

902.16 --> 907.5
said because that is yeah what else

905.399 --> 909.36
right it's just one of those things on

907.5 --> 912.06
the list so

909.36 --> 913.4590000000001
how long is it gonna take

912.06 --> 918.0
before

913.459 --> 921.0
suddenly a new disease arrives and now

918.0 --> 923.16
oh now you have to actually cooperate

921.0 --> 924.98
with the medical industrial complex

923.16 --> 928.079
anyway

924.98 --> 931.32
yay all left

928.079 --> 933.2399999999999
are you ready Italian people are you

931.32 --> 935.4590000000001
ready

933.24 --> 938.0600000000001
you're ready for all the left to show

935.459 --> 941.399
you that they're

938.06 --> 943.3199999999999
exactly the same they're just a it was

941.399 --> 945.42
just a mirror trick

943.32 --> 947.1600000000001
the face was just inverted and you

945.42 --> 950.2199999999999
thought it was somebody else but it was

947.16 --> 953.04
just a a trick

950.22 --> 956.1600000000001
and now the curtain's slowly gonna

953.04 --> 958.4399999999999
slide away maybe pretty fast even

956.16 --> 961.399
I mean it was quick to reveal that

958.44 --> 961.399
through that tweet

961.68 --> 967.9399999999999
so and then you're gonna see that they

964.5 --> 967.94
were exactly the same

969.36 --> 974.639
but now they have another type of

972.48 --> 978.36
Bravada angle of approach and they can

974.639 --> 981.42
actually punish you for that

978.36 --> 984.86
by doing terrible things in it in the

981.42 --> 989.9399999999999
name of right-wing thinking so they can

984.86 --> 993.48
slander you more huh how does it feel to

989.94 --> 996.24
be snatched by the balls because you're

993.48 --> 997.259
a [ __ ] idiots thinking that these

996.24 --> 1001.04
people

997.259 --> 1002.9590000000001
would have a chance to actually form a

1001.04 --> 1005.899
cohesive government

1002.959 --> 1009.9799999999999
against this Beast system like that

1005.899 --> 1013.639
without some serious arresting

1009.98 --> 1015.88
like covert operations to even start it

1013.639 --> 1015.88
out

1019.339 --> 1026.3600000000001
so get ready because you're gonna be

1022.04 --> 1029.0
right shamed not through ninning

1026.36 --> 1032.1399999999999
social justice Warriors and gays

1029.0 --> 1034.459
berating everywhere but through supposed

1032.14 --> 1036.6200000000001
right-wing government telling people

1034.459 --> 1038.78
that we're actually behind them and that

1036.62 --> 1040.28
are stuck in them they were just trying

1038.78 --> 1043.28
to be honorable

1040.28 --> 1046.1
by making them do extra brutal things

1043.28 --> 1048.3799999999999
and just turning it all to [ __ ] make the

1046.1 --> 1052.6999999999998
right wing look even worse

1048.38 --> 1055.4
alt left it's alt left world are you

1052.7 --> 1058.82
ready for 2022

1055.4 --> 1060.2
this is the time of the political alt

1058.82 --> 1062.12
left

1060.2 --> 1064.88
because yeah

1062.12 --> 1070.34
the established left order

1064.88 --> 1072.5
is getting isolated insane ineffective

1070.34 --> 1075.26
people are getting more dissatisfied so

1072.5 --> 1076.7
the alt left that moves forward to take

1075.26 --> 1078.08
some of that heat to become the

1076.7 --> 1080.48
lightning rod

1078.08 --> 1083.539
just like Trump was but he was kind of

1080.48 --> 1085.76
early right and being massively shamed

1083.539 --> 1088.94
by the media is part of it

1085.76 --> 1090.62
right the media was truly afraid of

1088.94 --> 1094.1000000000001
somebody

1090.62 --> 1098.3799999999999
they don't give him any attention

1094.1 --> 1098.3799999999999
you never even know that they were there

1100.28 --> 1107.6789999999999
it's attacked

1102.919 --> 1107.679
they're all in on it

1108.38 --> 1114.679
media

1110.62 --> 1119.4799999999998
political established New World Order

1114.679 --> 1121.76
alt left media Shines on them both one

1119.48 --> 1123.919
praising and glorifying the other

1121.76 --> 1124.53
shaming but they give them that

1123.919 --> 1127.72
attention

1124.53 --> 1127.72
[Music]

1127.76 --> 1130.12
see

1132.19 --> 1135.3590000000002
[Music]

1139.22 --> 1143.299
one of the few reasons I'm kind of happy

1141.38 --> 1146.0200000000002
to be

1143.299 --> 1149.24
so

1146.02 --> 1153.4
relatively unknown

1149.24 --> 1153.4
because at least I'm not out left

1156.38 --> 1161.1200000000001
as long as I'm just known by people

1158.96 --> 1163.64
you know that's really that thing that

1161.12 --> 1165.6789999999999
matters as long as people know you

1163.64 --> 1167.7800000000002
doesn't matter if the media talks about

1165.679 --> 1169.1000000000001
you all the time as long as people just

1167.78 --> 1172.7
know you

1169.1 --> 1174.5
that's the really important thing

1172.7 --> 1178.9
anyway

1174.5 --> 1178.9
so yeah was kind of inspired

1181.52 --> 1185.559
I hope you thought that was very

1183.08 --> 1185.559
interesting

1187.58 --> 1193.24
it's also just because of the beautiful

1189.5 --> 1193.24
weather that it was all energized

1193.64 --> 1198.44
I mean I've been thinking about this

1195.679 --> 1200.6000000000001
like since yesterday yesterday night I

1198.44 --> 1203.059
bumped into this yesterday evening and

1200.6 --> 1206.86
it was like you've got to be [ __ ] me

1203.059 --> 1206.86
I literally called that

1206.9 --> 1213.02
and like I didn't even want to believe

1209.66 --> 1215.74
it when I said that it's just that this

1213.02 --> 1215.74
is too much

1215.78 --> 1220.94
this can't be right

1218.539 --> 1222.84
and I was right

1220.94 --> 1224.48
unfortunately

1222.84 --> 1229.539
[Music]

1224.48 --> 1229.539
anyway let's see who's all in chat yeah

1230.96 --> 1235.7
uh

1232.76 --> 1237.39
Terror 306 JD

lva Paul good to see you and all flatter

1248.72 --> 1253.58

1250.52 --> 1256.34
Tony Whitcomb

1253.58 --> 1259.6999999999998
Glenn Lennox thanks for the PayPal the

1256.34 --> 1262.48
nation yesterday Len that was awesome

1259.7 --> 1262.48
keeps me going

1264.98 --> 1269.72
okay now let's actually read what you

1267.32 --> 1273.4399999999998
guys said because I have not read the

1269.72 --> 1276.02
chat at all after I started explaining

1273.44 --> 1278.3200000000002
it's not going to be interrupted in my

1276.02 --> 1278.32
thinking

1295.159 --> 1298.0
yeah

1298.96 --> 1304.82
yeah

1301.059 --> 1307.299
indeed he too very much ALT left you see

1304.82 --> 1307.299
what I mean

1309.34 --> 1315.26
their supposed

1311.32 --> 1317.36
right-wing style but they make it look

1315.26 --> 1320.84
bad

1317.36 --> 1323.0
actual classic right wing are really

1320.84 --> 1328.299
ordered

1323.0 --> 1328.299
and really like calm and wise people

1328.78 --> 1335.02
[Music]

1331.58 --> 1335.02
that's not what they are

1335.6 --> 1342.5
they're escalators

1338.6 --> 1345.74
right they are arousers escalators

1342.5 --> 1348.799
they want you to break up

1345.74 --> 1351.08
so they are almost like sjws but they're

1348.799 --> 1353.44
right wing so that's why they're all

1351.08 --> 1353.4399999999998
left

1353.6 --> 1358.8799999999999
I I

1354.82 --> 1361.84
fear to make the connection but in a way

1358.88 --> 1361.8400000000001
it's almost like

1362.059 --> 1368.72
they're kind of marxist

1365.36 --> 1372.32
but no but no that's incorrect because

1368.72 --> 1375.98
Marxism is kind of like overt

1372.32 --> 1378.32
and they are more secretive

1375.98 --> 1382.22
in the sense that they

1378.32 --> 1385.58
yeah now they're not marxists

1382.22 --> 1390.94
but they're still like a

1385.58 --> 1390.9399999999998
a manifested arm of the same machine

1396.92 --> 1401.539
[Music]

1399.02 --> 1403.94
because yeah marxists what what really

1401.539 --> 1406.82
makes them stand out in a terrible way

1403.94 --> 1407.72
is that they literally constantly just

1406.82 --> 1409.8799999999999
say

1407.72 --> 1411.799
this is what you're doing when they're

1409.88 --> 1413.48
what they're doing that or they're just

1411.799 --> 1416.6
saying we're gonna save this when they

1413.48 --> 1420.94
literally then go and destroy it

1416.6 --> 1420.9399999999998
and ALT left is not like that

1421.46 --> 1427.96
but they're still terrible and they're

1424.7 --> 1427.96
still warped

1434.72 --> 1439.3600000000001
oh okay isn't it okay

1446.17 --> 1449.5990000000002
[Music]

1451.94 --> 1454.179
foreign

1457.6 --> 1460.6699999999998
[Music]

1461.6 --> 1464.74
right and the weird thing about alt left

1463.88 --> 1468.14
is

1464.74 --> 1470.179
they're designed to basically take like

1468.14 --> 1473.419
Grassroots

1470.179 --> 1475.539
pull them in and then turn them into alt

1473.419 --> 1475.539
left

1477.16 --> 1480.419
[Music]

1483.2 --> 1489.6200000000001
because when you just

1485.48 --> 1491.6
follow that alleged winning formula or

1489.62 --> 1494.059
what seems like that

1491.6 --> 1497.059
then you take on their tactics their

1494.059 --> 1499.299
strategies the uniformity aspect all

1497.059 --> 1499.299
that

1499.7 --> 1503.96
but

1501.26 --> 1505.58
The Roots

1503.96 --> 1511.7
what they do

1505.58 --> 1514.1589999999999
is kind of like like Marxism is kind of

1511.7 --> 1516.559
it's all about just social engineering

1514.159 --> 1519.98
tactics whether the person will even

1516.559 --> 1523.6399999999999
realize that or not is another thing

1519.98 --> 1526.82
it's it's not actually Grassroots they

1523.64 --> 1529.039
just end up mowing the lawn pretty much

1526.82 --> 1531.74
yeah that's a pretty good analogy even

1529.039 --> 1537.58
out left is like a lawnmower

1531.74 --> 1537.58
they're just there to mow the Grassroots

1541.35 --> 1548.3
[Music]

1546.159 --> 1560.739
that's a good one

1548.3 --> 1560.739
[Music]

1569.96 --> 1574.96
what hey someone leaves banana cam

1584.96 --> 1587.5
huh

1590.36 --> 1598.059
wouldn't odd left be prone

1594.32 --> 1598.059
to consume what

1601.1 --> 1606.799
reading the definition what you're

1603.5 --> 1608.419
saying there is a official definition of

1606.799 --> 1612.08
alt left

1608.419 --> 1614.659
are you serious a man like me

1612.08 --> 1617.24
I didn't know that

1614.659 --> 1620.96
I I literally made it up it was just

1617.24 --> 1623.419
like a the mirror of alt-right

1620.96 --> 1625.24
it just kind of fizzled right that's

1623.419 --> 1628.22
what they were supposedly accused of

1625.24 --> 1630.86
originally I think like Hillary started

1628.22 --> 1634.48
that or something we alt right

1630.86 --> 1634.4799999999998
well they're actually all left

1654.62 --> 1658.12
oh okay

1659.6 --> 1662.3799999999999
huh

1667.59 --> 1672.1999999999998
[Music]

1670.659 --> 1673.7
okay

1672.2 --> 1676.299
well

1673.7 --> 1676.299
[ __ ]

1681.14 --> 1685.9
well that's certainly uh ruins that

1683.539 --> 1685.9
setup

1686.12 --> 1692.329
foreign

1688.97 --> 1692.329
[Music]

1692.38 --> 1700.0
way weirdly enough it still fits

1696.919 --> 1700.0
see what I mean

1705.679 --> 1708.5800000000002
that's

1714.22 --> 1720.94
in a weird look in a mirror Universe

1717.62 --> 1720.9399999999998
kind of way it is

1721.22 --> 1727.159
still a pretty good description wouldn't

1724.58 --> 1729.3799999999999
you say

1727.159 --> 1732.3400000000001
I mean

1729.38 --> 1732.3400000000001
[ __ ]

1733.64 --> 1737.0
yeah none of them just reading that

1735.5 --> 1739.4
carefully and just thinking like yeah

1737.0 --> 1741.08
how is this these people what they're

1739.4 --> 1743.3600000000001
doing

1741.08 --> 1745.1
yeah they are prone to conspiracy

1743.36 --> 1747.1999999999998
theories

1745.1 --> 1749.779
and they do treat the opposition as

1747.2 --> 1754.419
completely illegitimate in this case

1749.779 --> 1754.419
they really are most of the time

1755.539 --> 1760.12
for now at least but even back in the

1758.299 --> 1763.52
day when

1760.12 --> 1765.4399999999998
the left would make just a little bit

1763.52 --> 1767.059
more effort in certain ways they would

1765.44 --> 1770.24
still just keep [ __ ] and [ __ ]

1767.059 --> 1773.74
and [ __ ] on it especially Alex

1770.24 --> 1773.74
Jones but

1774.02 --> 1779.37
so

1776.36 --> 1782.8899999999999
it does kind of fit

1779.37 --> 1782.8899999999999
[Music]

1791.84 --> 1795.86
the problem is if I just call it alt

1794.659 --> 1798.7990000000002
right

1795.86 --> 1801.5
that would probably be more On Target

1798.799 --> 1803.6
it's just that

1801.5 --> 1806.72
that terminology

1803.6 --> 1809.539
wouldn't have the effect

1806.72 --> 1812.059
because the way it was introduced was as

1809.539 --> 1814.52
like oh that's like the extreme right

1812.059 --> 1817.279
sort of thing

1814.52 --> 1820.58
the actual dangerous opponent that's

1817.279 --> 1823.539
against us but that's specifically not

1820.58 --> 1823.539
what they are

1823.88 --> 1827.659
you see

1825.32 --> 1829.8799999999999
so it's kind of weird to just call them

1827.659 --> 1834.0390000000002
alt right it isn't and they're not right

1829.88 --> 1834.0390000000002
they are like covert left

1841.159 --> 1849.1000000000001
yeah maybe that's a good word for it

1843.32 --> 1849.1
covert left but alt left is just

1849.919 --> 1854.0200000000002
I'm just gonna keep using that until

1854.179 --> 1858.7
the akashic record just tells me

1856.46 --> 1858.7
different

1863.96 --> 1868.52
I mean I wouldn't tried a certain

1866.179 --> 1870.44
phraseology for it and that didn't

1868.52 --> 1873.759
really stick either

1870.44 --> 1873.759
[Music]

1876.2 --> 1881.26
covert left yeah I'll think about it

1881.29 --> 1884.92
[Music]

1886.1 --> 1891.3799999999999
not gonna just say oh yeah go for it

1888.559 --> 1894.08
left but I'll think about that for a

1891.38 --> 1898.179
while I mean all left I've been thinking

1894.08 --> 1898.1789999999999
about that work for like a month

1899.84 --> 1904.76
which is looking for the right timing

1901.94 --> 1907.279
and this was exactly the right timing to

1904.76 --> 1910.1
really just like have a title have a

1907.279 --> 1912.02
direct example and explain

1910.1 --> 1915.1
and compare

1912.02 --> 1915.1
to make an item

1917.06 --> 1924.1599999999999
[Music]

1929.81 --> 1943.07
[Music]

1949.96 --> 1954.679
or

1951.86 --> 1957.08
you could also call it the occulted left

1954.679 --> 1960.02
although yeah people would probably say

1957.08 --> 1962.0
a cult left and then that doesn't work

1960.02 --> 1965.179
but funny because of occulted meaning

1962.0 --> 1968.12
like covered up right and that's one of

1965.179 --> 1971.72
their trademarks of the old left

1968.12 --> 1975.7399999999998
is that the media always just covers

1971.72 --> 1978.159
them but negatively hmm

1975.74 --> 1981.32
so occulted left

1978.159 --> 1984.3990000000001
would basically point at that specific

1981.32 --> 1984.399
Factor about it

1989.63 --> 1992.8990000000001
[Music]

1991.1 --> 1995.6
right but

1992.899 --> 1998.1789999999999
whatever it's named or whatever it's

1995.6 --> 2001.0
going to turn out to be named by us we

1998.179 --> 2001.96
should realize that this is a thing this

2001.0 --> 2006.58
is like

2001.96 --> 2010.24
a fruit of social engineering

2006.58 --> 2012.58
from the yeah from the powers

2010.24 --> 2014.5
from the Beast system this is this is

2012.58 --> 2016.6
one of their fruits it's like an

2014.5 --> 2020.32
undercover

2016.6 --> 2021.82
controlled opposition factor and it's

2020.32 --> 2025.24
hypnotizing

2021.82 --> 2029.08
draws you in through your eager and your

2025.24 --> 2032.019
lust and and your natural impulses which

2029.08 --> 2033.519
is kind of also what communism and

2032.019 --> 2035.919
Marxism does

2033.519 --> 2037.5
but then eventually end up snuffing it

2035.919 --> 2041.019
out

2037.5 --> 2043.36
left doesn't do that they especially

2041.019 --> 2045.46
they make sure that you don't snap out

2043.36 --> 2049.08
of it they want to keep you there they

2045.46 --> 2049.08
want to keep you hypnotized with that

2050.5 --> 2054.0
they need to keep you agitated

2055.599 --> 2059.619
right

2057.339 --> 2061.839
to always think about the ultimate

2059.619 --> 2064.06
opponent and what they're secretly doing

2061.839 --> 2065.2599999999998
in their torture dungeons

2064.06 --> 2067.72
huh

2065.26 --> 2069.5800000000004
and that's all odd left

2067.72 --> 2071.4399999999996
so they don't snuff out your natural

2069.58 --> 2073.48
impulses and just start telling you you

2071.44 --> 2075.46
need to follow this program that's the

2073.48 --> 2077.619
how we develop

2075.46 --> 2080.98
through the evolution and against

2077.619 --> 2082.78
climate change blah blah blah no

2080.98 --> 2086.139
they don't do that

2082.78 --> 2090.28
instead they make you burn yourself out

2086.139 --> 2092.8
over those impulses instead of making

2090.28 --> 2094.2400000000002
you snuff them out actively by

2092.8 --> 2096.7000000000003
suppression

2094.24 --> 2098.25
so they do exactly the opposite with the

2096.7 --> 2101.7189999999996
same end result

2098.25 --> 2101.719
[Music]

2102.64 --> 2105.5989999999997
can you see it

2108.76 --> 2113.28
it's all about mowing the lawn

2116.99 --> 2126.839
[Music]

2124.42 --> 2126.839
foreign

2128.74 --> 2132.6099999999997
[Music]

2153.099 --> 2158.619
but they all lie and cover their lies

2156.22 --> 2161.98
with help from media

2158.619 --> 2165.52
yes a man like me good good one because

2161.98 --> 2168.7
the media connection is really important

2165.52 --> 2172.66
to be able to distinguish

2168.7 --> 2175.14
all left from a genuine opposition to

2172.66 --> 2175.14
globalism

2177.04 --> 2180.46
right

2178.72 --> 2184.74
because

2180.46 --> 2184.7400000000002
they do media do cover

2185.32 --> 2188.32
negatively

2188.38 --> 2191.04
and

2191.32 --> 2197.92
they're probably also

2194.26 --> 2200.26
in the business of drag the blackmail

2197.92 --> 2202.78
with things

2200.26 --> 2205.3
so they withhold in some information

2202.78 --> 2206.98
they will always slander the same [ __ ]

2205.3 --> 2210.099
standard program is just character

2206.98 --> 2211.72
assassination and other Nazis and blah

2210.099 --> 2213.04
blah blah doesn't make any sense but

2211.72 --> 2216.64
that's what they do

2213.04 --> 2219.579
but when it's really important they will

2216.64 --> 2219.8599999999997
actually make secret backdoor deals and

2219.579 --> 2221.6800000000003
like

2219.86 --> 2225.3
[Music]

2221.68 --> 2225.2999999999997
probably blackmail

2228.099 --> 2231.9
and by the way that happens to just the

2230.5 --> 2235.74
regular

2231.9 --> 2235.7400000000002
globalists as well so

2237.16 --> 2241.839
I mean blackmail [ __ ] it's just around

2239.98 --> 2243.52
the corner everywhere there

2241.839 --> 2246.94
but the old left

2243.52 --> 2249.359
they also just have a connection with

2246.94 --> 2249.359
media

2250.54 --> 2253.699
[Music]

2256.0 --> 2265.06
right you could almost argue

2259.92 --> 2267.06
that some of these moves are purely

2265.06 --> 2271.06
like

2267.06 --> 2274.7799999999997
ideological bribes

2271.06 --> 2277.119
to get factions on their side at least

2274.78 --> 2281.2000000000003
temporarily it's like oh

2277.119 --> 2283.2400000000002
you want better media coverage well then

2281.2 --> 2285.7
you're gonna have to Virtue signal that

2283.24 --> 2288.4599999999996
you support Ukraine

2285.7 --> 2290.5
and a really high spot especially if you

2288.46 --> 2293.2
promise the opposite I mean that's like

2290.5 --> 2295.3
wow you just took a fall right in front

2293.2 --> 2298.06
of everybody

2295.3 --> 2301.0600000000004
but for a cost that we like oh we'll

2298.06 --> 2302.98
give you some lenience Trump has done

2301.06 --> 2305.099
that sort of [ __ ] too

2302.98 --> 2308.5
remember

2305.099 --> 2310.3
superheated and then like

2308.5 --> 2312.94
what happened again

2310.3 --> 2316.3
was it during warp speed then suddenly

2312.94 --> 2318.82
the media was like oh okay

2316.3 --> 2320.8
huh he's they they were just like oh

2318.82 --> 2322.1800000000003
that is just dumb and they were much

2320.8 --> 2323.5
more calm now

2322.18 --> 2324.7599999999998
right

2323.5 --> 2327.16
it's like

2324.76 --> 2330.5200000000004
the satanists that do their thing their

2327.16 --> 2332.98
puppetry in the media seats they just

2330.52 --> 2335.56
like get be dwelled like oh he's on

2332.98 --> 2337.72
their side now oh now we don't really

2335.56 --> 2340.9
want to punish him as much it's just

2337.72 --> 2342.16
like scoffing a bit

2340.9 --> 2345.1600000000003
right that's

2342.16 --> 2346.7799999999997
that's what these actions maybe are I

2345.16 --> 2349.72
wonder

2346.78 --> 2351.94
if it was all like okay when are we

2349.72 --> 2354.4599999999996
gonna roll out tactically that we

2351.94 --> 2358.18
actually support Ukraine oh this is the

2354.46 --> 2360.7
timing or was it like ah this media is

2358.18 --> 2363.04
driving me insane why did I promise all

2360.7 --> 2366.04
these things and now everybody's

2363.04 --> 2369.04
attacking me yeah no [ __ ] Sherlock

2366.04 --> 2371.5
okay I I I'll just say something good

2369.04 --> 2374.98
about Ukraine and then maybe the shock

2371.5 --> 2378.64
of that will make it stop a little

2374.98 --> 2382.0
that could be the reason too

2378.64 --> 2384.7
right and that's why I cannot say with

2382.0 --> 2387.76
absolute certainty that is it's gonna

2384.7 --> 2389.68
turn into a complete Fiasco that she

2387.76 --> 2392.44
made that tweet

2389.68 --> 2394.24
all depends on how much action will

2392.44 --> 2397.54
follow up on that

2394.24 --> 2400.359
but the telltale signs of alt leftism is

2397.54 --> 2403.06
in there because always don't blame the

2400.359 --> 2406.3199999999997
Muslims Muslim violence

2403.06 --> 2406.32
very typical

2406.48 --> 2413.38
right I mean if you would really want to

2409.599 --> 2415.1800000000003
tackle problems of like people from the

2413.38 --> 2418.2400000000002
Middle East

2415.18 --> 2420.16
that are really terrible at moving over

2418.24 --> 2421.8999999999996
here in Europe and just having their

2420.16 --> 2424.0
ghettos and whatever

2421.9 --> 2427.1800000000003
yeah that's not Muslims if you really

2424.0 --> 2430.72
wanted to tackle them you would actually

2427.18 --> 2431.7999999999997
start showing the background of these

2430.72 --> 2434.2599999999998
people

2431.8 --> 2437.5
how they're not Muslims how they

2434.26 --> 2439.9
probably fled Muslim countries because

2437.5 --> 2441.82
of their terrible Behavior

2439.9 --> 2446.56
yeah

2441.82 --> 2450.28
the truth the truth has something out

2446.56 --> 2452.74
left won't do they won't do it they will

2450.28 --> 2456.76
not do it because they want that wound

2452.74 --> 2459.7599999999998
it's all tactics Nazi tactics yeah Nazi

2456.76 --> 2463.1800000000003
tactics they leave

2459.76 --> 2467.7400000000002
those terrible people that aren't Muslim

2463.18 --> 2469.7799999999997
stay there as like a agitation puppet

2467.74 --> 2472.54
they'll leave them there they'll like

2469.78 --> 2475.0
not let them [ __ ] all over the place as

2472.54 --> 2477.88
much probably they'll be let the police

2475.0 --> 2480.04
be stricter and have more action like

2477.88 --> 2482.2000000000003
because they yeah they do go out of

2480.04 --> 2484.24
control and they will probably do

2482.2 --> 2488.02
something against that at least right

2484.24 --> 2490.4199999999996
but then they're not gonna like truly

2488.02 --> 2493.78
make you decipher what they really are

2490.42 --> 2496.2400000000002
how they're not Muslims no

2493.78 --> 2498.4
they'll actually it will go as far as to

2496.24 --> 2500.7599999999998
like giving make sure making sure that

2498.4 --> 2503.8
they have like radios to follow like

2500.76 --> 2506.98
imams and [ __ ] from foreign countries

2503.8 --> 2509.619
because then if a foreign country Imam

2506.98 --> 2512.859
gets riled up because I don't know some

2509.619 --> 2515.7400000000002
covert operation blew up a mosque again

2512.859 --> 2519.64
from yeah you know that sort of [ __ ]

2515.74 --> 2521.56
well then those those dredges

2519.64 --> 2523.1189999999997
well they just gotten in the habit of

2521.56 --> 2524.099
just listening to that and they're like

2523.119 --> 2526.3
oh

2524.099 --> 2527.7000000000003
then suddenly there must live in their

2526.3 --> 2530.5600000000004
mind like

2527.7 --> 2532.66
they have something to Riot over then

2530.56 --> 2536.619
they break out right guess what happens

2532.66 --> 2538.359
now now that political group out left

2536.619 --> 2540.88
can say

2538.359 --> 2544.18
it's organized

2540.88 --> 2546.4
see the Imam from that country did that

2544.18 --> 2550.96
and now we're being attacked from the

2546.4 --> 2555.0
inside by these Muslims yeah that's the

2550.96 --> 2558.099
tactic you filthy Nazi

2555.0 --> 2559.359
yeah don't think I don't see how that

2558.099 --> 2563.44
works

2559.359 --> 2563.44
alt left Nazi

2566.87 --> 2570.699
[Music]

2573.94 --> 2575.35
foreign

2574.15 --> 2577.42
[Music]

2575.35 --> 2580.72
[Applause]

2577.42 --> 2583.42
it's genius and I hate it it's so

2580.72 --> 2586.4399999999996
disgusting it's so degenerating it makes

2583.42 --> 2586.44
everybody stupid

2589.56 --> 2593.469
[Music]

2602.619 --> 2606.3
so what are we talking about today

2606.579 --> 2612.0600000000004
what do you think we're talking about

2608.2 --> 2612.06
Darren have you been listening

2613.119 --> 2618.579
talking about alt left

2615.52 --> 2620.74
alt left tactics how it works why they

2618.579 --> 2622.8390000000004
have certain narratives always

2620.74 --> 2626.4399999999996
why they always blame Muslims for

2622.839 --> 2630.32
immigration [ __ ]

2626.44 --> 2631.96
just arrived oh God yeah that's too bad

2630.32 --> 2634.0
[Music]

2631.96 --> 2635.819
not gonna do that all over again I've

2634.0 --> 2638.92
been Non-Stop

2635.819 --> 2641.079
explaining for like half an hour and

2638.92 --> 2643.38
then another 20 minutes on top of that

2641.079 --> 2643.38
so

2649.52 --> 2656.859
[Music]

2653.04 --> 2658.12
right anyway if you appreciate what I do

2656.859 --> 2660.64
here

2658.12 --> 2664.839
[Music]

2660.64 --> 2666.52
I refined insights that are very pure in

2664.839 --> 2670.119
the sense that I have not been entangled

2666.52 --> 2672.819
I barely even read things I'm serious I

2670.119 --> 2676.839
barely read things

2672.819 --> 2679.9
because I read other things I read the

2676.839 --> 2682.599
spirit newspaper I don't read

2679.9 --> 2684.76
text as much I only have to read very

2682.599 --> 2686.319
few and then just the spiritual metadata

2684.76 --> 2690.96
will give me

2686.319 --> 2690.96
hours and hours of pondering material

2692.14 --> 2697.839
which I can get a lot further in

2695.64 --> 2702.48
refining and understanding things than

2697.839 --> 2702.48
if I would just keep reading more text

2710.71 --> 2716.319
[Music]

2713.319 --> 2716.319
uh

2719.7 --> 2726.18
playing his part in The Matrix what are

2722.859 --> 2726.18
you talking about lva ball

2726.28 --> 2729.0
serious

2729.66 --> 2736.68
Ukraine [ __ ] started in 2016 I think 14

2734.079 --> 2736.6800000000003
or something

2740.38 --> 2746.26
it had yeah it's been for what it's been

2743.619 --> 2748.6800000000003
there for a while lva Paul what are you

2746.26 --> 2748.6800000000003
talking about

2749.92 --> 2752.46
foreign

2757.26 --> 2760.329
[Music]

2765.28 --> 2770.38
yes yeah Tara 306 yeah that's what

2767.92 --> 2772.66
happens when you retain your cohesion

2770.38 --> 2774.52
and Purity and keep collecting

2772.66 --> 2777.819
information and building

2774.52 --> 2779.38
you become more you become like

2777.819 --> 2782.92
intellectually

2779.38 --> 2784.7200000000003
but only because of their principles you

2782.92 --> 2786.52
become intellectually Superior and

2784.72 --> 2788.859
that's palpable

2786.52 --> 2789.88
people will start to take you more

2788.859 --> 2792.64
serious

2789.88 --> 2795.2400000000002
just instinctively by the way you

2792.64 --> 2795.24
compose yourself

2802.24 --> 2808.68
but it is very important to besides

2806.02 --> 2811.78
having the inside also be able to tame

2808.68 --> 2815.7
your impulses because you will have more

2811.78 --> 2815.7000000000003
of that the more you know

2827.74 --> 2834.2999999999997
such minute details what do you mean

2830.56 --> 2834.2999999999997
such many details what

2855.27 --> 2859.369
[Music]

2861.88 --> 2864.6600000000003
right

2865.3 --> 2870.0
by the way

2867.04 --> 2870.0
what's that

2870.4 --> 2873.819
yeah if you just seen it you said

2872.38 --> 2875.02
something really good like 10 minutes

2873.819 --> 2876.819
ago

2875.02 --> 2878.44
oh idea

2876.819 --> 2880.48
to give people the illusion that there's

2878.44 --> 2881.92
democracy if you don't support the hard

2880.48 --> 2884.38
loony left

2881.92 --> 2888.359
then there's a fake alternative

2884.38 --> 2888.359
put your energy into supporting

2888.4 --> 2891.119
correct

2892.78 --> 2898.3
right

2894.46 --> 2902.14
or instead of doing either one of those

2898.3 --> 2904.119
you don't support that and instead you

2902.14 --> 2907.859
choose

2904.119 --> 2910.6600000000003
to support individuals that are provably

2907.859 --> 2914.4
exacting change

2910.66 --> 2914.3999999999996
in some positive way

2915.04 --> 2919.18
and if they're doing it consistently and

2917.74 --> 2922.9599999999996
like keep

2919.18 --> 2925.839
having an upwards curve in quality

2922.96 --> 2927.64
then they might have even further

2925.839 --> 2929.98
long-term vision

2927.64 --> 2932.56
you're just gonna have to see if they

2929.98 --> 2934.42
can do that

2932.56 --> 2938.5789999999997
but if you support that if you support

2934.42 --> 2938.579
things that actually exact change

2939.16 --> 2943.18
then you know at least there is

2941.02 --> 2945.099
something changing because the problem

2943.18 --> 2947.6189999999997
is is that things are the way they are

2945.099 --> 2950.44
or if you invest in something that

2947.619 --> 2953.38
actually exacts change then

2950.44 --> 2954.88
at least you'll do something that is

2953.38 --> 2956.7400000000002
effective instead of just being

2954.88 --> 2959.1600000000003
frustrated over things that you're not

2956.74 --> 2959.16
changing

2965.079 --> 2968.04
are you doing

2968.46 --> 2971.659
[Music]

2980.099 --> 2987.52
right yeah later if you just seen it

2983.64 --> 2990.18
[Music]

2987.52 --> 2990.18
ah

2990.66 --> 2996.2799999999997
all right

2993.16 --> 2998.92
that's so weird

2996.28 --> 3001.4
look at that and it's not a chemtrail

2998.92 --> 3001.4
huh

3002.22 --> 3007.859
this weird Haze but it's so big

3005.04 --> 3010.38
and it's not a chemtrail

3007.859 --> 3013.74
it's pretty sure it isn't

3010.38 --> 3015.96
right so all the way from there to over

3013.74 --> 3020.25
there just this big

3015.96 --> 3024.0
thing and over there some of that

3020.25 --> 3024.0
[Music]

3024.599 --> 3029.46
I miss that

3026.58 --> 3033.359
[Music]

3029.46 --> 3037.2
whatever it is it looks pretty beautiful

3033.359 --> 3039.04
the sun is still very nicely shiny

3037.2 --> 3042.9489999999996
through those clouds

3039.04 --> 3042.949
[Music]

3043.56 --> 3049.68
ah damn it camera freeze

3046.68 --> 3049.68
[ __ ]

3051.72 --> 3056.839
I hate it when that happens okay let's

3054.18 --> 3056.839
do that again

3062.72 --> 3069.2599999999998
right so feather

3065.94 --> 3069.26
all the way over there

3070.319 --> 3073.819
and over there a bit

3073.92 --> 3082.28
behind the more prominent clouds

3077.7 --> 3082.2799999999997
but behind that's just regular blue

3083.88 --> 3088.04
picture isn't that just amazing

3109.0 --> 3114.859
[Music]

3112.26 --> 3114.8590000000004
okay

3120.07 --> 3128.38
[Music]

3131.94 --> 3138.319
I only talk about Fe when people ask

3134.88 --> 3138.319
when face to face

3145.619 --> 3151.02
okay well

3148.26 --> 3154.7000000000003
face to face I don't think anybody has

3151.02 --> 3154.7
ever asked me about Flat Earth

3154.92 --> 3157.4
really

3167.9 --> 3180.46
[Music]

3185.17 --> 3188.389
[Music]

3193.52 --> 3197.219
[Music]

3201.74 --> 3206.8799999999997
okay so everybody's just leaving for

3204.54 --> 3208.94
like 20 minutes now

3206.88 --> 3211.38
great

3208.94 --> 3214.04
I never bring it up

3211.38 --> 3214.04
okay

3214.74 --> 3219.4399999999996
well I never just bring it up just like

3217.2 --> 3219.4399999999996
that

3222.0 --> 3226.859
it's like at the end of a long list

3224.52 --> 3229.02
right to First have to go through more

3226.859 --> 3230.96
basic things

3229.02 --> 3234.0
and just see how people respond to that

3230.96 --> 3236.04
so A good vantage point is for example

3234.0 --> 3237.26
hey do you think politicians might be

3236.04 --> 3239.4
lying

3237.26 --> 3242.57
right I mean

3239.4 --> 3246.119
that's as basic as you can get

3242.57 --> 3246.119
[Music]

3246.3 --> 3251.04
I mean if they can't handle that then

3248.7 --> 3254.1189999999997
they're probably insane you wouldn't

3251.04 --> 3254.119
want to talk with them anyway

3258.18 --> 3262.68
but that way you can basically give them

3260.64 --> 3264.96
an angle of approach

3262.68 --> 3267.4199999999996
more easily so that they're more

3264.96 --> 3269.579
prepared instead of just like hey what

3267.42 --> 3273.1800000000003
do you think about the Earth shape you

3269.579 --> 3275.4
think it's a ball no it's flat if you

3273.18 --> 3277.6189999999997
just roll in just like that you'll get

3275.4 --> 3279.48
people totally off guard and it can like

3277.619 --> 3283.1400000000003
totally

3279.48 --> 3286.339
like disrupt whatever they're doing

3283.14 --> 3286.339
in a bad way

3287.28 --> 3291.8390000000004
so that's why I don't recommend doing

3289.559 --> 3293.6400000000003
that just always Build It Up carefully

3291.839 --> 3295.14
if you're gonna do that in the first

3293.64 --> 3297.48
place right

3295.14 --> 3300.2999999999997
and if you figure out as you like test

3297.48 --> 3302.16
the waters like hey politicians lie hey

3300.3 --> 3303.7000000000003
what do you think about

3302.16 --> 3305.7599999999998
9 11.

3303.7 --> 3307.0789999999997
[Music]

3305.76 --> 3311.1600000000003
right

3307.079 --> 3314.099
or hey you think that the boxes might be

3311.16 --> 3316.74
a problem right step by step by step and

3314.099 --> 3317.94
then like eventually like yeah did you

3316.74 --> 3320.8799999999997
know that

3317.94 --> 3323.04
there's actually agencies out there that

3320.88 --> 3324.1800000000003
are literally dedicated to fabricating

3323.04 --> 3326.04
lies

3324.18 --> 3327.72
I mean you probably figured out that

3326.04 --> 3329.64
there are agencies that lie right but

3327.72 --> 3332.0989999999997
did you know that they are actually also

3329.64 --> 3335.24
the Guardians of a really big lie that's

3332.099 --> 3335.2400000000002
been going on for

3335.64 --> 3343.44
as long as yeah we can remember

3340.8 --> 3345.48
and like being re-attempted

3343.44 --> 3348.599
and that way

3345.48 --> 3351.78
slowly building it up then

3348.599 --> 3354.839
then they might be able to actually

3351.78 --> 3357.9
take that weight instead of just ich

3354.839 --> 3360.48
cringe getting smashed under a giant

3357.9 --> 3363.9
weight like if you totally roll out Flat

3360.48 --> 3367.5
Earth right away right

3363.9 --> 3369.42
I want them to just first get some

3367.5 --> 3370.98
training get like get used to their

3369.42 --> 3373.2000000000003
weight like oh do you realize there's a

3370.98 --> 3375.96
little more but yeah did you notice a

3373.2 --> 3379.5589999999997
little more and then it's like oh and

3375.96 --> 3381.54
here's the big one here's the atlas one

3379.559 --> 3384.119
the actual Earth

3381.54 --> 3386.339
and then they might be able to be like

3384.119 --> 3389.0
damn

3386.339 --> 3389.0
huh

3390.119 --> 3397.98
at least they'll not be like ah I'm

3393.54 --> 3399.48
trying to forget about it now uh right

3397.98 --> 3403.099
because that's not gonna accomplish

3399.48 --> 3403.099
anything it's just gonna ruin their day

3405.15 --> 3413.03
[Music]

3413.579 --> 3418.84
right anyway

3415.42 --> 3418.84
[Music]

3419.579 --> 3425.78
I want to enjoy some of that sun sorry

3422.099 --> 3428.88
dude I'm gonna step outside for a second

3425.78 --> 3431.78
if you anybody has any questions about

3428.88 --> 3433.26
anything including the subject of today

3431.78 --> 3436.1400000000003
[Music]

3433.26 --> 3440.42
by all means

3436.14 --> 3440.42
put it in the chat and I'll respond

3481.28 --> 3484.46
and I'm back

3482.78 --> 3486.9
[Music]

3484.46 --> 3488.94
sorry I didn't mean to get in the way

3486.9 --> 3490.76
what are you talking about a man like me

3488.94 --> 3494.64
I mean

3490.76 --> 3495.599
PGC net and Tara just basically left the

3494.64 --> 3498.359
check

3495.599 --> 3500.579
you're not in the way you're just the

3498.359 --> 3503.339
last one that's still kind of talking oh

3500.579 --> 3506.3
did you see that so bad

3503.339 --> 3506.2999999999997
hey hello Cleary

3507.18 --> 3509.7799999999997
all right

3510.82 --> 3514.159
[Music]

3515.88 --> 3521.099
that's right if you just seen it that's

3518.339 --> 3522.839
right and that's why I brought it up in

3521.099 --> 3525.6600000000003
that kind of order right

3522.839 --> 3529.619
do politicians lie

3525.66 --> 3532.0789999999997
very basic like a child might not be

3529.619 --> 3535.079
able to handle that seriously I wasn't

3532.079 --> 3537.2400000000002
able to handle that what they like ah

3535.079 --> 3539.46
that brought me anguish like actual

3537.24 --> 3541.68
anguish as a kid so

3539.46 --> 3543.66
then like okay if they realize yeah

3541.68 --> 3546.4199999999996
politicians lie then they're at least

3543.66 --> 3548.64
like somewhat

3546.42 --> 3552.299
sensible then you can start hey how

3548.64 --> 3554.64
about 9 11. you think that that was what

3552.299 --> 3558.54
they said it was

3554.64 --> 3561.2599999999998
tough but hey it's like 20 years

3558.54 --> 3561.2599999999998
so

3563.94 --> 3569.52
another staircase right so you have to

3566.099 --> 3570.3590000000004
just tell test them one staircase at a

3569.52 --> 3572.16
time

3570.359 --> 3574.319
and if at some point they're like I'm

3572.16 --> 3577.14
not gonna go there I'm not gonna go to

3574.319 --> 3579.54
that next step well then why the hell do

3577.14 --> 3581.04
you want to drag them all the way to the

3579.54 --> 3582.42
top there

3581.04 --> 3585.359
yeah

3582.42 --> 3587.4
no you gotta take it step by step

3585.359 --> 3589.44
that's how I learned to do it in

3587.4 --> 3592.2000000000003
face-to-face situations

3589.44 --> 3595.2000000000003
and that way I've prevented people from

3592.2 --> 3597.0
just really hating me

3595.2 --> 3600.299
because every time I didn't do it

3597.0 --> 3603.599
because I was kind of like anxious

3600.299 --> 3607.98
and then started to be like huh you just

3603.599 --> 3610.6800000000003
don't get this and that Flat Earth

3607.98 --> 3612.72
I was basically using it to grandstand

3610.68 --> 3615.0589999999997
because I was insecure and every time

3612.72 --> 3616.9199999999996
I've done that it's always had a

3615.059 --> 3618.619
terrible effect like those people would

3616.92 --> 3623.42
always end up

3618.619 --> 3623.42
not respecting or trusting me

3623.68 --> 3628.14
[Music]

3625.38 --> 3629.11
that's why I'm never doing that again

3628.14 --> 3631.74
this is

3629.11 --> 3632.9900000000002
[Music]

3631.74 --> 3637.4399999999996
uh

3632.99 --> 3639.24
[Music]

3637.44 --> 3641.94
went through baby steps before you

3639.24 --> 3644.16
clicked yeah logically well generally

3641.94 --> 3646.68
that's how I

3644.16 --> 3647.94
went into a lot of stuff except Flat

3646.68 --> 3650.64
Earth

3647.94 --> 3653.579
because I just couldn't connect it

3650.64 --> 3655.74
first fit it doesn't even make any sense

3653.579 --> 3657.299
because the First videos that I saw were

3655.74 --> 3659.04
in the freaking Dark World when they

3657.299 --> 3662.85
weren't even out yet

3659.04 --> 3664.2
from Eric Dubai in 2012. yeah

3662.85 --> 3665.819
[Music]

3664.2 --> 3667.5589999999997
so

3665.819 --> 3670.619
I've always had kind of a weird thing

3667.559 --> 3673.92
with flat Earth I never bumped into it

3670.619 --> 3676.04
like when actually on YouTube or

3673.92 --> 3676.04
whatever

3676.559 --> 3679.26
browsing because I didn't have an

3678.48 --> 3681.299
account

3679.26 --> 3685.28
it just

3681.299 --> 3685.28
I would never find anything like that

3685.5 --> 3691.38
everything else sure like blowing up

3688.98 --> 3693.44
Earth and like all these weird Hollow

3691.38 --> 3697.38
Earth everything right everything

3693.44 --> 3702.0
mystical and lay lines and

3697.38 --> 3704.28
the black hole with the w wall

3702.0 --> 3706.64
from Nasi paramine it was really into

3704.28 --> 3706.6400000000003
that

3707.0 --> 3712.74
fascinating like mathematical

3709.579 --> 3714.54
extrapolations he made but it's all math

3712.74 --> 3717.9599999999996
though

3714.54 --> 3719.64
but it was really fascinating that's the

3717.96 --> 3721.44
kind of stuff that I was so much into

3719.64 --> 3723.48
right but I just wouldn't bump into

3721.44 --> 3725.4
anything Flat Earth except in the

3723.48 --> 3729.319
freaking dark world

3725.4 --> 3729.319
ah freaky

3731.94 --> 3745.239
[Music]

3746.599 --> 3751.52
couple in the moon lander deniers

3752.76 --> 3759.48
yeah well the moon landing is like

3757.079 --> 3761.3390000000004
that would be the first the before last

3759.48 --> 3764.54
step

3761.339 --> 3764.54
before Flat Earth

3764.94 --> 3770.2200000000003
I mean the moon landing is the moon

3766.98 --> 3771.96
landing real or fake is like

3770.22 --> 3773.0989999999997
the footstool

3771.96 --> 3777.859
to the

3773.099 --> 3777.8590000000004
the actual top of the staircase

3784.92 --> 3788.599
which conspiracy

3793.2 --> 3799.6189999999997
when is it advised to introduce it

3797.28 --> 3801.8590000000004
well why the hell would you want to do

3799.619 --> 3801.859
that

3804.0 --> 3806.66
I mean

3814.04 --> 3820.44
I wouldn't bring that up unless somebody

3816.9 --> 3824.2200000000003
was like already kind of seasoned

3820.44 --> 3827.099
and interested in conspiracy

3824.22 --> 3829.5
not like who the [ __ ] would just drop

3827.099 --> 3832.2000000000003
that on somebody

3829.5 --> 3836.579
I mean they gotta be

3832.2 --> 3839.5789999999997
naturally curious and smart

3836.579 --> 3841.44
and just kind of a conspiracy theorist

3839.579 --> 3844.2000000000003
already to even

3841.44 --> 3847.16
yeah for me to even consider bringing

3844.2 --> 3847.16
that up thanks

3847.26 --> 3855.619
because it is really terrifying

3851.22 --> 3855.6189999999997
when you get real with it it is

3858.02 --> 3863.7599999999998
terrifying and insane and so

3861.24 --> 3867.359
I like to just not bring that up right

3863.76 --> 3869.8190000000004
just like did you know but they're

3867.359 --> 3871.74
drinking a dream you groom and torturing

3869.819 --> 3873.66
little kids yeah that's why you don't

3871.74 --> 3876.18
want to bring that up either unless

3873.66 --> 3879.5989999999997
you're a demonically possessed freak

3876.18 --> 3881.0989999999997
let's just become obsessed with demonics

3879.599 --> 3883.2000000000003
yeah

3881.099 --> 3884.88
I don't like to bring that up I don't

3883.2 --> 3888.24
even like it if other people rang that

3884.88 --> 3892.26
up I think it's utterly disgusting and

3888.24 --> 3896.24
like dangerous to literally utter those

3892.26 --> 3896.2400000000002
words in public it's like

3896.7 --> 3901.799
talking in the language of Mordor you

3899.7 --> 3903.5699999999997
just don't do that

3901.799 --> 3913.78
don't do that

3903.57 --> 3913.78
[Music]

3914.88 --> 3921.839
that's why every time I even mention any

3918.72 --> 3924.0789999999997
of those things I naturally distort my

3921.839 --> 3924.0789999999997
voice

3925.14 --> 3929.5789999999997
have you noticed I cannot just say those

3928.14 --> 3932.46
things

3929.579 --> 3937.2200000000003
because they are so

3932.46 --> 3937.2200000000003
they yeah I have to protect myself

3940.46 --> 3944.21
[Music]

3946.74 --> 3952.799
if I don't say it in a ridiculous voice

3949.079 --> 3957.2000000000003
then it might catch me

3952.799 --> 3957.2
and then I'll get really [ __ ] upset

3957.94 --> 3965.3
[Music]

3989.039 --> 3994.559

3994.559 --> 4002.77
big idiots then I mean Soros is there

4013.16 --> 4020.799

4028.28 --> 4035.3190000000004
consider him to be insane

4031.819 --> 4035.319
because he is

4036.619 --> 4040.0
have you ever noticed that

4040.7 --> 4048.319
oh anti-semitic he is insane and he is

4044.839 --> 4051.64
really evil he's a destroyer

4048.319 --> 4051.64

4052.76 --> 4074.289
he loves ruining people's lives

4088.4 --> 4093.38
when was it Glover moon landing got you

4091.94 --> 4095.42
pissed off

4093.38 --> 4097.16
that's really funny that you say that

4095.42 --> 4100.06
because

4097.16 --> 4100.0599999999995
me too

4100.759 --> 4105.799
you know when I was a little kid I was

4103.219 --> 4109.04
like a massive fan

4105.799 --> 4111.5
of moon landing stuff

4109.04 --> 4113.7789999999995
and like I wanted to see the old stuff

4111.5 --> 4115.16
it's like show me that stuff from the

4113.779 --> 4116.900000000001
70s

4115.16 --> 4119.48
I want to see that

4116.9 --> 4122.54
I wanted the old books

4119.48 --> 4125.12
about it I loved that [ __ ] I thought it

4122.54 --> 4127.58
was so amazing and I just didn't see

4125.12 --> 4129.8589999999995
that it was just kind of a

4127.58 --> 4132.44
yeah fake project

4129.859 --> 4136.1
but if somebody would talk about that it

4132.44 --> 4139.48
would like hey stop talking about that

4136.1 --> 4139.4800000000005
you're ruining my dream

4152.18 --> 4155.339
[Music]

4166.299 --> 4171.08
sorry the evil uses money freaking he

4169.16 --> 4175.599999999999
uses everything for control I mean the

4171.08 --> 4175.6
the guy is like a veteran Marxist

foreign

4192.54 --> 4202.609
[Music]

4219.52 --> 4224.84
it doesn't piss me out well yeah well if

4222.8 --> 4227.0
at this point it doesn't piss you off or

4224.84 --> 4229.04
another

4227.0 --> 4231.26
yeah

4229.04 --> 4233.659
then it just doesn't mean anything

4231.26 --> 4235.76
anymore to you because you're used to it

4233.659 --> 4237.5599999999995
now you're used to Flat earthers being

4235.76 --> 4239.719
out there and all that

4237.56 --> 4243.679
you've heard them out you're literally

4239.719 --> 4245.84
here following a flat earther Channel

4243.679 --> 4249.52
so yeah no no it's no surprise you're

4245.84 --> 4249.52
not getting that response anymore

4249.679 --> 4255.14
from within yourself but hey back in the

4252.98 --> 4258.98
day

4255.14 --> 4262.06
none of this was there was no internet

4258.98 --> 4262.0599999999995
there wasn't any

4263.659 --> 4269.719
so I didn't know anything about any

4267.32 --> 4274.0
alternative view I was just in love with

4269.719 --> 4274.0
the imagery and the and the dream of it

4274.1 --> 4280.58
I had it all copied in my mind

4278.06 --> 4282.950000000001
I had dreams where I would literally be

4280.58 --> 4286.09
planning space missions and [ __ ]

4282.95 --> 4286.09
[Music]

4286.34 --> 4288.9400000000005
right

4290.36 --> 4296.12
now that's a long time ago

4293.84 --> 4298.46
especially as a preteen I had a lot of

4296.12 --> 4299.96
those types of dreams and then in my

4298.46 --> 4303.079
teens too but

4299.96 --> 4303.079
[Music]

4303.08 --> 4307.84
it was already kind of dissipating

4305.06 --> 4310.52
because I already had like pretty full

4307.84 --> 4313.04
full-on confrontations with that space

4310.52 --> 4315.320000000001
was fake and all that I just

4313.04 --> 4319.78
couldn't snap out of the dream so

4315.32 --> 4319.78
basically I started to split up

4320.84 --> 4326.54
where I would just really believe it and

4324.08 --> 4329.78
then be snapped out of it sometimes and

4326.54 --> 4332.48
be really scared

4329.78 --> 4335.36
like really scared all the time

4332.48 --> 4337.879999999999
when I was snapped out of it

4335.36 --> 4340.339999999999
and then eventually I learned how to

4337.88 --> 4342.92
basically snap myself in so I would then

4340.34 --> 4344.78
have like a weird day where I'd have

4342.92 --> 4347.86
like really elaborate conversations

4344.78 --> 4351.62
about Maps or something

4347.86 --> 4354.259999999999
and that totally was Flat Earth

4351.62 --> 4356.42
but I would just kind of like Ballers do

4354.26 --> 4357.92
now kind of like automatically just let

4356.42 --> 4359.3
it all happen

4357.92 --> 4360.86
learn

4359.3 --> 4363.4400000000005
like from a

4360.86 --> 4365.42
sensory point about it

4363.44 --> 4367.339999999999
so that it would be in my memory but

4365.42 --> 4368.96
then later I would just forget about it

4367.34 --> 4370.88
and the next day I wouldn't remember

4368.96 --> 4373.46
that it happened

4370.88 --> 4375.32
but it's still like stored in my memory

4373.46 --> 4377.179
I just couldn't reach it anymore

4375.32 --> 4378.08
consciously because I had to turn it off

4377.179 --> 4381.32
again

4378.08 --> 4384.8
because I would not be subjected to

4381.32 --> 4386.96
prolonged exposure of that level

4384.8 --> 4390.9800000000005
I couldn't handle the truth but I

4386.96 --> 4393.5
learned how to be dynamic with it

4390.98 --> 4396.32
as a very young kid like before I

4393.5 --> 4397.88
understood it I I had Dynamics to deal

4396.32 --> 4400.759999999999
with that which I did not understand

4397.88 --> 4402.92
yeah

4400.76 --> 4405.320000000001
I'm a wizard

4402.92 --> 4408.56
but I did

4405.32 --> 4410.42
I had like conceptions on how to deal

4408.56 --> 4412.219
with information that you cannot handle

4410.42 --> 4415.159
yet

4412.219 --> 4417.62
and I learned how to learn about it

4415.159 --> 4419.179
without making it disrupt my

4417.62 --> 4421.82
consciousness

4419.179 --> 4423.14
in retrospect having all those traits

4421.82 --> 4425.12
and having done those types of things

4423.14 --> 4428.96
I'm not surprised that I had all these

4425.12 --> 4432.14
weird Dark World Visions and [ __ ]

4428.96 --> 4436.659
because in a way I was kind of like

4432.14 --> 4436.659000000001
naturally self-hypnotizing myself

4438.08 --> 4444.34
doing tricks with information that I

4441.86 --> 4446.78
didn't even fully understand that I

4444.34 --> 4449.84
compartmentalized in understanding and

4446.78 --> 4453.259999999999
not knowing anything about it in my mind

4449.84 --> 4456.58
at a very young age

4453.26 --> 4456.58
talking pre-teens

4456.86 --> 4461.54
I naturally learned to do that I didn't

4459.26 --> 4463.6990000000005
even see other I didn't even like learn

4461.54 --> 4467.08
that from seeing it from my parents no

4463.699 --> 4467.08
it just started happening

4479.179 --> 4487.04
all right and for me as a little kid the

4482.96 --> 4491.9800000000005
realization that what everybody gets to

4487.04 --> 4491.98
see is basically a foolish lie

4493.3 --> 4499.400000000001
was so painful to me

4496.219 --> 4502.159
that it made me like not want to live

4499.4 --> 4504.86
not like oh I'm killing myself but just

4502.159 --> 4508.219
like losing all hope

4504.86 --> 4510.92
it like and that that didn't go away it

4508.219 --> 4512.96
wasn't like oh my god oh and then get

4510.92 --> 4514.88
over it no it would be it would stay it

4512.96 --> 4517.219
would be like I am in a world of hell

4514.88 --> 4520.1
and everything is a lie

4517.219 --> 4521.3
and like nobody I know even knows the

4520.1 --> 4524.42
truth

4521.3 --> 4526.9400000000005
like my parents can't handle the truth

4524.42 --> 4529.4
nobody I've ever met could handle the

4526.94 --> 4532.699
truth and I realized those things in

4529.4 --> 4535.82
that state and it was terrible it was

4532.699 --> 4537.678999999999
torturous so I just kind of snapped

4535.82 --> 4540.98
myself back in

4537.679 --> 4542.719
jack myself in again she's okay going to

4540.98 --> 4544.28
bed and then I'm gonna forget about this

4542.719 --> 4545.96
and the next day it's like nothing ever

4544.28 --> 4548.3
happened

4545.96 --> 4550.34
but I still have those memories I just

4548.3 --> 4552.26
didn't have them available to my

4550.34 --> 4554.12
conscience in that moment I had that

4552.26 --> 4557.08
turn off

4554.12 --> 4560.42
so that it could survive and sort of

4557.08 --> 4562.64
have a resemblance of what seemed like a

4560.42 --> 4565.1
normal life

4562.64 --> 4568.659000000001
I was really desperate to retain some

4565.1 --> 4568.659000000001
resemblance of a normal life

4572.42 --> 4577.6990000000005
and that started like really breaking

4575.0 --> 4579.739
apart in my teens

4577.699 --> 4581.239
when I realized that's not gonna happen

4579.739 --> 4583.5199999999995
with me

4581.239 --> 4585.199
everybody is on autopilot and they're

4583.52 --> 4587.7390000000005
buying into things that they're gonna

4585.199 --> 4589.4
like regret

4587.739 --> 4591.98
infinitely

4589.4 --> 4595.659
later on and they already saw that and I

4591.98 --> 4595.659
couldn't do anything to stop anybody

4595.94 --> 4599.96
and then I didn't know what the hell am

4597.86 --> 4602.36
I gonna do

4599.96 --> 4606.34
with all this Insight what the hell am I

4602.36 --> 4606.339999999999
supposed to do with all this in my life

4608.239 --> 4612.58
well

4609.32 --> 4612.58
now I'm doing this

4615.04 --> 4620.84
right the only

4618.1 --> 4622.9400000000005
conclusion that I could draw to somehow

4620.84 --> 4624.860000000001
tie it in and at first it just did not

4622.94 --> 4627.62
appeal to me at all it's just freaking

4624.86 --> 4629.239
talk about it talk about it until you

4627.62 --> 4631.4
find people that are actually gonna

4629.239 --> 4634.48
listen

4631.4 --> 4634.48
talk about everything

4636.44 --> 4642.0199999999995
and I am that's where I am now I'm here

4639.38 --> 4644.4800000000005
I'm doing that and when I had my vision

4642.02 --> 4648.7390000000005
and when I was 17

4644.48 --> 4651.099999999999
I saw that this is what I was gonna do

4648.739 --> 4653.9
with all the dread and all the

4651.1 --> 4657.56
demoralization also

4653.9 --> 4660.799999999999
and I wanted it now I did not want to go

4657.56 --> 4664.719
through all that [ __ ] to get there

4660.8 --> 4664.719
I just wanted it available

4664.82 --> 4669.32
right there

4666.86 --> 4672.679
I didn't get it

4669.32 --> 4675.04
but I tried to grasp it from within the

4672.679 --> 4675.04
visions

4675.199 --> 4679.759999999999
and eventually realized that if I just

4677.659 --> 4682.42
started today if I would have like from

4679.76 --> 4686.06
within the vision started to

4682.42 --> 4688.64
basically meddle with my

4686.06 --> 4692.38
with the rollout of my life that I would

4688.64 --> 4692.38
probably end up destroying it

4693.56 --> 4702.400000000001
and this is also just weird yeah

4697.46 --> 4702.4
Timeless metaphorical situation where

4703.28 --> 4710.5
within the vision part of what I did was

4706.28 --> 4710.5
basically harass myself

4713.179 --> 4719.9800000000005
it's like I was there to test my own

4716.06 --> 4719.9800000000005
weaknesses and harass myself

4721.64 --> 4724.3
like

4724.699 --> 4729.259999999999
yeah and that's

4727.159 --> 4730.94
ongoing

4729.26 --> 4733.400000000001
so

4730.94 --> 4736.719
I still know that that's still going to

4733.4 --> 4736.719
happen even in the future

4738.739 --> 4744.199
right

4740.9 --> 4747.0199999999995
anyway part this type of situation like

4744.199 --> 4749.54
this how that works to me

4747.02 --> 4752.3
it sounds kind of scary probably to

4749.54 --> 4754.64
anybody that has enough sensibility to

4752.3 --> 4757.1
to even figure that out

4754.64 --> 4759.92
that's part of the reason also why I

4757.1 --> 4761.780000000001
call it the 80 years of hell because it

4759.92 --> 4765.38
wasn't just all ugly

4761.78 --> 4769.239
but the weight of all of it was so much

4765.38 --> 4769.2390000000005
that I just could not enjoy it

4769.34 --> 4773.14
I like enjoyed the first

4773.3 --> 4781.58
the first season of that

4777.08 --> 4783.14
and the rest of the 79 years and three

4781.58 --> 4788.0
seasons

4783.14 --> 4790.820000000001
were not enjoyable it just made me stare

4788.0 --> 4794.36
at all the pain everywhere in everything

4790.82 --> 4796.34
in myself in the metaphysics in how

4794.36 --> 4799.299999999999
everything works

4796.34 --> 4799.3
and just

4800.78 --> 4805.179
it did bring out a lot of despise

4807.38 --> 4811.84
resent

4808.94 --> 4811.839999999999
resentment

4812.54 --> 4816.56
and it's always a struggle to just not

4814.699 --> 4819.94
let that get to me because if it does

4816.56 --> 4819.9400000000005
then the devil has won

4819.98 --> 4824.36
over me

4821.78 --> 4827.139999999999
and I'm not letting that happen I have

4824.36 --> 4827.139999999999
to trust that

4828.92 --> 4835.4
the ugliness and

4831.199 --> 4837.799999999999
the pain of oversight is only there

4835.4 --> 4840.04
just to make room for the miracles of

4837.8 --> 4840.04
god

4840.739 --> 4844.9
that happen in a response to it

4848.96 --> 4853.88
setting a good thought to Robert yes

4850.82 --> 4856.58
yeah he's in surgery right now

4853.88 --> 4858.5
or he will be soon so yeah

4856.58 --> 4861.4
definitely giving good thoughts to him

4858.5 --> 4861.4
and prayers

4866.8 --> 4871.149
[Music]

4873.32 --> 4875.92
goodness

4876.26 --> 4880.360000000001
thanks for reminding me orinocobombo

4882.199 --> 4886.9
anyway I hope you find this is all

4884.36 --> 4886.9
interesting

4892.04 --> 4894.5199999999995
funny

4895.04 --> 4900.92
that that I just like attained the word

4898.04 --> 4904.46
wizard and all that and that it gives

4900.92 --> 4907.6990000000005
all these reactions from people

4904.46 --> 4909.62
it's so funny so funny to just say like

4907.699 --> 4913.5199999999995
yeah I'm a wizard

4909.62 --> 4916.699
and not say it jokingly

4913.52 --> 4918.38
yeah just to see what people do it's

4916.699 --> 4921.5
almost like when you say I'm a wizard

4918.38 --> 4925.400000000001
and you mean it and you have explanation

4921.5 --> 4927.76
for what about you is that how that

4925.4 --> 4927.759999999999
works

4927.98 --> 4933.379999999999
it's

4929.9 --> 4938.259999999999
it almost has a similar reaction as just

4933.38 --> 4938.26
flat Earth does with with some people

4939.08 --> 4945.34
it's so funny

4941.719 --> 4948.62
then again of course the the Wizard

4945.34 --> 4951.860000000001
conception has been popularly used to

4948.62 --> 4954.08
point out media liars and all that and

4951.86 --> 4956.179
Spin Doctors

4954.08 --> 4958.94
so yeah I cannot

4956.179 --> 4961.78
actually blame it I find it very

4958.94 --> 4961.78
annoying though

4962.54 --> 4966.56
because

4964.58 --> 4968.84
yeah there's good wizards and there's

4966.56 --> 4970.64
bad Wizards it's the same with

4968.84 --> 4973.64
everything by the way

4970.64 --> 4975.7390000000005
there's good everything and there's bad

4973.64 --> 4978.14
everything

4975.739 --> 4980.718999999999
pick a category

4978.14 --> 4983.179
it has good versions

4980.719 --> 4988.2390000000005
with good morale and it has bad versions

4983.179 --> 4988.2390000000005
with with terrible morale and tactics

4989.0 --> 4993.94
so hey hello creation bear good to see

4991.76 --> 4993.9400000000005
you

4997.64 --> 5001.9800000000005
like good witches and bad witches

5007.3 --> 5011.38
right but it's very simple by their

5009.4 --> 5014.639999999999
fruits you shall know them and by their

5011.38 --> 5014.64
methods you shall know them

5016.9 --> 5021.879999999999
it's always the same it's you Jo you go

5020.38 --> 5025.02
for the action

5021.88 --> 5025.02
go for the action

5025.48 --> 5028.48
still a witch yeah but what does that

5027.4 --> 5031.62
mean

5028.48 --> 5031.62
what does that mean Scott

5033.28 --> 5037.679
good God and bad God no

5039.159 --> 5042.48
God is God

5043.239 --> 5046.32
there's only one

5046.48 --> 5052.718999999999
but he can give you many faces

5052.84 --> 5058.0
little G

5054.42 --> 5061.4800000000005
representative representations and

5058.0 --> 5063.04
formula rollouts on how to approach

5061.48 --> 5066.48
him

5063.04 --> 5066.48
and the spiritual Realm

5067.12 --> 5073.08
where God rules because he's literally

5069.219 --> 5073.08
the creator of the information itself

5074.8 --> 5080.9400000000005
right but yeah little G God good God bad

5078.699 --> 5080.94
God

5083.44 --> 5087.28
there are no good yeah but what is a

5085.84 --> 5092.04
witch

5087.28 --> 5092.04
Scott what is it what's a witch

5098.8 --> 5102.06
what is a witch

5118.14 --> 5121.56
witch do you mean

5125.02 --> 5131.1
someone who thinks they can perform

5127.239 --> 5131.099999999999
magic or some such

5132.04 --> 5136.179
okay

5133.6 --> 5138.96
why aren't they good

5136.179 --> 5138.96
why not

5144.94 --> 5148.48
I mean what's bad about it what's bad

5147.58 --> 5151.179
about

5148.48 --> 5154.0
like focusing your intention to

5151.179 --> 5157.96
do some specific end

5154.0 --> 5159.04
you know other people like pray or they

5157.96 --> 5161.86
just wish

5159.04 --> 5165.46
for something

5161.86 --> 5167.98
right is that is that evil

5165.46 --> 5172.0
or is it only evil when you do that same

5167.98 --> 5174.839999999999
thing but you think you're doing magic

5172.0 --> 5174.84
what's the difference

5176.88 --> 5181.56
yeah that's cute but what is it though

5190.84 --> 5197.679
I mean if you can be specific about it

5194.139 --> 5200.9800000000005
and say yeah okay I'm going to say a

5197.679 --> 5203.86
witch is somebody who literally makes a

5200.98 --> 5209.099999999999
pact with Satan who steps outside of the

5203.86 --> 5209.099999999999
veil to commune with the all

5209.32 --> 5216.84
Earthly powerful and evil the sacrifice

5213.28 --> 5216.84
you're like with Baal or something

5217.0 --> 5222.34
or moloch

5218.679 --> 5225.639
right and then literally creates a

5222.34 --> 5228.1
tradition of sacrifice like killing

5225.639 --> 5231.88
animals or even people

5228.1 --> 5235.900000000001
for like yeah that's that's evil

5231.88 --> 5239.38
that's I get it that's evil

5235.9 --> 5241.0
but is that what a witch is well in that

5239.38 --> 5243.46
case there's a whole bunch of people out

5241.0 --> 5246.1
there that aren't witches

5243.46 --> 5248.44
but they are kind of witch themed they

5246.1 --> 5250.84
like it it's like oh this is my version

5248.44 --> 5253.0
of Harry Potter or I just really like

5250.84 --> 5254.92
seasonal themed things and they're like

5253.0 --> 5257.32
spices and

5254.92 --> 5258.6990000000005
it are they evil are they making a pact

5257.32 --> 5261.719
with the Devil

5258.699 --> 5261.719
I don't think so

5262.96 --> 5266.34
so what is it

5269.32 --> 5273.84
it's all magic isn't it what

5274.12 --> 5279.76
yeah but what makes prayer

5276.639 --> 5282.46
different from witchcraft

5279.76 --> 5285.96
prayer is also thinking

5282.46 --> 5285.96
that by your intention

5286.36 --> 5289.679
you can alter something

5290.679 --> 5295.2390000000005
and you use the Arbiter of what you

5293.739 --> 5296.739
think is God

5295.239 --> 5299.94
to do that

5296.739 --> 5299.94
you commune with that

5302.02 --> 5308.080000000001
how's that different from somebody who

5304.54 --> 5311.94
thinks like oh yeah

5308.08 --> 5311.94
I'm gonna wish for a bigger car

5314.679 --> 5321.9400000000005
except by well the motivations and

5317.32 --> 5321.94
spirit of it and Etc right

5323.62 --> 5326.62
foreign

5328.78 --> 5332.679
people actually thinking they perform

5331.179 --> 5335.5
Magic

5332.679 --> 5340.7390000000005
some of them are

5335.5 --> 5340.739
I mean I like to say that I use Magic

5341.5 --> 5346.239
it's part of what I do I mean quite

5344.62 --> 5349.42
literally

5346.239 --> 5351.159
but I'm dead doing any rituals yeah

5349.42 --> 5353.62
because I figured out that that's a

5351.159 --> 5356.679
waste of time I have talent that

5353.62 --> 5357.82
surpasses that by far I don't need that

5356.679 --> 5360.9
[ __ ]

5357.82 --> 5360.9
like at all

5366.82 --> 5373.659
yeah but I use my centuries and I it

5369.76 --> 5377.1990000000005
reaches beyond the regular also I got

5373.659 --> 5379.96
direct healing abilities

5377.199 --> 5383.0199999999995
I can magnetize it can literally feel

5379.96 --> 5385.78
exactly what type of pain somebody else

5383.02 --> 5388.659000000001
feels at a distance without touching

5385.78 --> 5391.36
them yeah and it can exactly describe

5388.659 --> 5394.44
what they're feeling

5391.36 --> 5394.44
is that magic

5395.98 --> 5402.4
I can also take it away by the way

5399.46 --> 5404.26
is that magic is that evil

5402.4 --> 5405.82
so Scott

5404.26 --> 5407.62
maybe you should

5405.82 --> 5411.099999999999
think about what you're saying before

5407.62 --> 5414.0
you make roll out these insane

5411.1 --> 5414.0
statements

5414.639 --> 5419.58
does that make you a wizard well I like

5416.92 --> 5419.58
to say so

5421.9 --> 5424.32
yeah

5424.42 --> 5430.6
I'm a wizard I perform Magic

5427.719 --> 5433.36
I'm also a diviner

5430.6 --> 5436.120000000001
I don't use ritual

5433.36 --> 5438.82
I don't call upon the Four Seasons blah

5436.12 --> 5441.099999999999
blah blah and draw a circle I can't do

5438.82 --> 5443.98
that I just don't do that I don't need

5441.1 --> 5447.159000000001
to you see like those aren't even the

5443.98 --> 5448.78
sources that I draw in I don't need that

5447.159 --> 5451.659
level of protection

5448.78 --> 5456.46
because I keep my soul very pure and

5451.659 --> 5459.82
made sacrifices for that like personal

5456.46 --> 5463.54
Spirit based sacrifices not

5459.82 --> 5466.599999999999
entities other than my own

5463.54 --> 5469.719
and I don't have that issue I don't need

5466.6 --> 5471.88
this protection like that sometimes I

5469.719 --> 5474.82
need protection when I get into like

5471.88 --> 5477.1
social conflict with people then I call

5474.82 --> 5479.739
my healers like really good at removing

5477.1 --> 5483.900000000001
that over the phone and palpably

5479.739 --> 5483.9
affecting me is that magic

5485.1 --> 5488.219
excuse me

5489.28 --> 5493.32
yeah sorry that's copyrighted

5499.9 --> 5505.0
you know my business is good on you

5503.8 --> 5507.04
bro

5505.0 --> 5507.94
I don't give a [ __ ] if you believe it

5507.04 --> 5509.739
though

5507.94 --> 5511.719
I'm only talking to you about this

5509.739 --> 5515.218999999999
because I'm trying to make a distinct

5511.719 --> 5515.219
Point that's all

5515.26 --> 5520.360000000001
because I know what I can do I don't

5517.659 --> 5522.82
give a [ __ ] if people believe that I can

5520.36 --> 5525.4
do that or not I know I can do these

5522.82 --> 5528.28
things I also know that I don't talk

5525.4 --> 5530.679
about things that are lies

5528.28 --> 5534.099999999999
I would never like Bluff about what I

5530.679 --> 5537.82
can actually do I have done that in the

5534.1 --> 5540.96
far past with disastrous consequences

5537.82 --> 5540.96
so I'm not doing that

5541.02 --> 5549.6
best I can hold some back

5545.62 --> 5549.599999999999
and leave it for later

5549.76 --> 5555.88
because sharing

5552.28 --> 5558.78
all your intensity just to show off may

5555.88 --> 5558.78
leave you vulnerable

5559.42 --> 5562.139
uh

5562.42 --> 5568.12
yeah to see anyway yeah oh okay if you

5565.6 --> 5572.02
don't want to see it you don't see it

5568.12 --> 5573.159
yeah did you know that this belief not

5572.02 --> 5577.06
believing

5573.159 --> 5579.28
is actually spell negation

5577.06 --> 5582.580000000001
literally skepticism

5579.28 --> 5585.12
and I've tested this personally to a

5582.58 --> 5585.12
high degree

5587.26 --> 5594.12
skepticism can literally leave you

5589.9 --> 5594.12
untouched it's like spell resistance

5598.06 --> 5603.1
it's because there is a weird

5600.52 --> 5605.26
Consciousness voluntary component to all

5603.1 --> 5607.780000000001
of it

5605.26 --> 5610.360000000001
so if somebody just chooses not to

5607.78 --> 5613.38
believe something then that will

5610.36 --> 5613.38
influence the result

5615.52 --> 5620.4400000000005
that will influence whether they can be

5617.92 --> 5622.719
influenced by it

5620.44 --> 5625.12
just by how you approach it if you

5622.719 --> 5628.42
approach it with skepticism you fill it

5625.12 --> 5632.699
all in as it depends

5628.42 --> 5632.6990000000005
yeah and then it doesn't work on you

5636.04 --> 5640.98
yeah believe it when you see it uh I

5638.32 --> 5640.98
don't care Scott

5649.239 --> 5653.98
cool

5651.1 --> 5656.860000000001
yeah it's a fantasy all right that I

5653.98 --> 5660.5199999999995
literally use on myself when I'm

5656.86 --> 5663.58
otherwise in great anguish because I can

5660.52 --> 5666.820000000001
literally remove pain locally

5663.58 --> 5669.219
yeah that's all my fantasy I mean I'm

5666.82 --> 5671.4
not just surviving because of it and all

5669.219 --> 5671.4
that

5681.699 --> 5686.32
[ __ ] out of here

5683.62 --> 5690.5199999999995
[ __ ]

5686.32 --> 5692.44
dude I wouldn't even have any hair

5690.52 --> 5695.860000000001
yeah you realize you're [ __ ] little

5692.44 --> 5698.44
[ __ ] I'm 42 okay I'm 42 and I still

5695.86 --> 5701.82
have most of it yeah

5698.44 --> 5701.82
you probably don't

5702.04 --> 5707.08
you probably lost your freaking head

5704.739 --> 5708.7699999999995
hair before you even got puke you

5707.08 --> 5711.929
[ __ ] [ __ ]

5708.77 --> 5711.929
[Music]

5714.48 --> 5717.679999999999
[Music]

5718.98 --> 5722.5199999999995
hey at least G

5726.1 --> 5728.1
Onna

5734.8 --> 5737.400000000001
foreign

5740.46 --> 5744.939
[Music]

5754.199 --> 5759.82
considered the use of ether that's

5757.42 --> 5763.54
hilarious

5759.82 --> 5765.58
uh well Spirit ether Maybe

5763.54 --> 5768.3
I don't think so it's more like

5765.58 --> 5768.3
something Electric

5769.659 --> 5775.78
a man like me like my healing

5771.94 --> 5777.96
magnetizing it's electric it feels

5775.78 --> 5777.96
Electric

5788.56 --> 5793.360000000001
I can also like generate serious heat

5791.199 --> 5795.28
with these hands by the way like really

5793.36 --> 5798.28
hot

5795.28 --> 5800.62
like it's a hot blanket

5798.28 --> 5803.44
and it will be very specifically here

5800.62 --> 5806.32
not like the rest of my arm no only the

5803.44 --> 5808.599999999999
hands so yeah there's all these

5806.32 --> 5812.44
abilities and a lot of people have this

5808.6 --> 5815.8
they just have it most don't even

5812.44 --> 5816.82
name it they just do it they just apply

5815.8 --> 5818.7390000000005
it

5816.82 --> 5823.08
they don't even talk about it that

5818.739 --> 5823.08
nobody really knows that they have it

5829.96 --> 5834.699
yeah please do support me indeed I mean

5832.78 --> 5837.639
I thought that Today's show was pretty

5908.94 --> 5914.379999999999
but yeah that magic

5911.739 --> 5918.04
it's not the devil's magic because I am

5914.38 --> 5922.0
not good with money I do not touch or

5918.04 --> 5924.48
use my Powers concerning money

5922.0 --> 5924.48
I don't

5931.48 --> 5936.178999999999

6111.91 --> 6115.05
[Music]

6124.619 --> 6131.58
yeah now I'm not here to fool your

6127.56 --> 6133.860000000001
senses and tell you the world isn't real

6131.58 --> 6136.0199999999995
because then you go into solar system

6133.86 --> 6137.94
mode and just like oh no so it doesn't

6136.02 --> 6139.5
matter anymore nothing matters oh why

6137.94 --> 6141.48

6139.5 --> 6143.82
[ __ ] atheism huh

6141.48 --> 6145.138999999999
[ __ ] atheism oh wait God doesn't

6143.82 --> 6148.44
exist

6145.139 --> 6150.2390000000005
oh oh look at all that room oh look at

6148.44 --> 6152.339999999999
all that void oh Suddenly It's all

6150.239 --> 6154.379999999999
meaningless and now you get bored and

6152.34 --> 6156.360000000001
what am I gonna do I want to think of

6154.38 --> 6159.54
something original everything has

6156.36 --> 6162.739
already been done yeah

6159.54 --> 6162.739
it's the same [ __ ]

6163.8 --> 6169.56
switch off your sensories become a

6166.56 --> 6172.38
dumbass on autopilot

6169.56 --> 6175.080000000001
in a delusional world that is absolutely

6172.38 --> 6177.42
not makes no sense

6175.08 --> 6180.0
where you can be desensitized not

6177.42 --> 6181.4400000000005
understand anything and scoff at

6180.0 --> 6184.5
everything

6181.44 --> 6187.44
because hey all the other numpties do it

6184.5 --> 6190.92
too so that the way to do things right

6187.44 --> 6193.799999999999
yeah turning yourself off relinquishing

6190.92 --> 6196.46
that spirit that challenge of God

6193.8 --> 6199.5
turn it off believe in the dumbass

6196.46 --> 6203.04
delusional [ __ ] that's obviously

6199.5 --> 6205.92
wrong but that makes you a [ __ ]

6203.04 --> 6207.78
just do that it's also easy

6205.92 --> 6210.6
you don't have to think so much you

6207.78 --> 6212.4
could just be bored and just long for

6210.6 --> 6214.320000000001
entertainment that you don't understand

6212.4 --> 6216.659
what the [ __ ] going on anymore because

6214.32 --> 6219.619
you're such a [ __ ] [ __ ] now

6216.659 --> 6219.619
just do that

6221.99 --> 6225.12
[Music]

6244.739 --> 6252.178999999999
well I didn't give a [ __ ] dude

6248.82 --> 6254.88
I'm gonna say wizard wizard wizard

6252.179 --> 6257.88
wizard I'm one I don't give a [ __ ] if

6254.88 --> 6261.54
you don't think that I am one

6257.88 --> 6263.76
I am one I can describe why I think so

6261.54 --> 6266.5199999999995
I'm not here for your [ __ ] little

6263.76 --> 6268.1990000000005
entertainment you freaking Harry Potter

6266.52 --> 6269.280000000001
retards

6268.199 --> 6272.94
yeah

6269.28 --> 6276.54
this is not about flashy stupid things

6272.94 --> 6278.28
that are metaphors yeah it's all

6276.54 --> 6279.98
metaphors in there yeah I don't deal

6278.28 --> 6284.46
with that [ __ ]

6279.98 --> 6285.379999999999
Wizards yeah a real wizard is about one

6284.46 --> 6290.46
thing

6285.38 --> 6293.88
one thing not stupid parlor tricks not

6290.46 --> 6296.4
fleshy nonsense and robes

6293.88 --> 6297.659000000001
and beguiling although some specialize

6296.4 --> 6301.86
at that yeah

6297.659 --> 6301.86
no it's about knowledge

6302.06 --> 6305.54
in sight

6306.32 --> 6313.199
I don't know about that oh it's all just

6309.48 --> 6316.459999999999
about mesmering lies and yeah yeah

6313.199 --> 6321.0199999999995
so that most people end up doing with it

6316.46 --> 6321.02
waste all their sensory and talents

6325.98 --> 6331.879999999999
spiritual abilities too yeah but that's

6328.56 --> 6331.88
what comes with that

6333.659 --> 6340.739
you need knowledge and insight to be

6337.199 --> 6344.759999999999
able to contain your own abilities that

6340.739 --> 6346.5599999999995
you naturally have including healing

6344.76 --> 6348.719
and empathy

6346.56 --> 6351.42
because you're born with those abilities

6348.719 --> 6354.2390000000005
and unless you actually learn to manage

6351.42 --> 6356.159
them they're probably going to be ripped

6354.239 --> 6359.699
away from you

6356.159 --> 6361.86
yeah desensitizing you'll be locked in

6359.699 --> 6364.739
with a paradigm that denies their

6361.86 --> 6367.98
existence and so they fade away

6364.739 --> 6368.638999999999
yeah you can lose all your abilities you

6367.98 --> 6370.86
know

6368.639 --> 6372.96
just denying they exist

6370.86 --> 6376.339999999999
huh yeah

6372.96 --> 6376.34
yeah I don't do that

6376.8 --> 6381.49
foreign

6378.15 --> 6381.49
[Music]

6385.94 --> 6391.138999999999

6391.139 --> 6395.6990000000005
wasn't it

6392.28 --> 6397.86
yet so much spiritual metadata like when

6395.699 --> 6400.919999999999
he was talking about it he was literally

6397.86 --> 6404.04
there and he just had like a

6400.92 --> 6406.26
a print of what was happening in his

6404.04 --> 6409.139
mind there's so much spiritual method

6406.26 --> 6411.84
that it was like one of the

6409.139 --> 6414.0
yeah it was amazing

6411.84 --> 6416.84
I'm glad you enjoyed it and found some

6414.0 --> 6416.84
inspiration in there

6417.6 --> 6422.0
right but I'm gonna round out this show

6419.58 --> 6422.0
because

6422.88 --> 6426.26
wow time has flown

6430.139 --> 6434.46
right

6431.76 --> 6435.96
so thanks everyone for coming I hope you

6434.46 --> 6438.3
like this show

6435.96 --> 6440.76
got a little bit political but hey I

6438.3 --> 6444.0
laid down a what I think is a real thing

6440.76 --> 6446.88
and that should absolutely be considered

6444.0 --> 6448.619
like everybody should everybody should

6446.88 --> 6451.139
consider like the first part of what I

6448.619 --> 6453.119
was talking about this show I mean it's

6451.139 --> 6455.400000000001
very relevant it's something that's like

6453.119 --> 6458.099999999999
being birthed

6455.4 --> 6461.0
it's developing

6458.1 --> 6464.34
it's like arise it wasn't there before

6461.0 --> 6467.82
it this wasn't here like in the night in

6464.34 --> 6469.619000000001
the 20th century this is relatively new

6467.82 --> 6471.9
and it's like really starting to

6469.619 --> 6474.54
manifest more and more now where it'll

6471.9 --> 6476.699
go I don't know it might be smothered

6474.54 --> 6478.26
very quickly I mean this is an age of

6476.699 --> 6480.178999999999
Awakening and the internet people are

6478.26 --> 6482.76
figuring out things quickly

6480.179 --> 6485.34
but it is happening and it is happening

6482.76 --> 6487.679
in this pattern so I definitely if you

6485.34 --> 6490.139
just came in late I urge you to watch

6487.679 --> 6493.5
