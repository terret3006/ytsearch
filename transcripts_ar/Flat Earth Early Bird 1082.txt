yeah weather today is

105.759 --> 109.43900000000001
different

107.36 --> 111.52
it's cloudy

109.439 --> 115.32
uniformly and it's

111.52 --> 115.32
very windy

115.84 --> 122.64
it's making me really restless

119.36 --> 127.399
it's just this constant gale

122.64 --> 127.399
sometimes get pretty gets pretty hard

142.64 --> 148.48
i had a lot of restless dreaming as well

146.64 --> 151.04
because yeah i was like that since

148.48 --> 155.76
yesterday night so it's just been a

151.04 --> 155.76
restless night although i did get sleep

161.44 --> 166.4
hello club ruckus

163.44 --> 168.8
first in chat jeff gas head

166.4 --> 171.92000000000002
good to see you

168.8 --> 175.8
it is friday the 26th

171.92 --> 175.79999999999998
of november 2021

182.0 --> 186.879
yeah i don't know what what i'm gonna be

183.76 --> 186.879
like on today's show

188.0 --> 193.12
i don't feel as knackered

190.72 --> 195.04
as it were as i did yesterday but i do

193.12 --> 198.72
feel like a restless so

195.04 --> 201.67999999999998
just all this wind

198.72 --> 201.68
makes me nervous

204.4 --> 207.4
right

212.879 --> 218.72
i've been watching some owen benjamin

216.08 --> 220.799
before the show

218.72 --> 223.2
and that also made me nervous not

220.799 --> 225.59900000000002
because it wasn't great

223.2 --> 228.23899999999998
was really great but because like the

225.599 --> 230.23899999999998
recording was

228.239 --> 231.519
stuttering

230.239 --> 234.0
like

231.519 --> 236.56
constantly like

234.0 --> 237.599
snippets of like a quarter second or

236.56 --> 239.84
something

237.599 --> 241.04
were cut out it was really getting on my

239.84 --> 242.31900000000002
nerves because

241.04 --> 244.48
multiple

242.319 --> 246.0
sentences were just interrupted because

244.48 --> 248.0
of that

246.0 --> 249.519
so that didn't really help my nerves

248.0 --> 252.72
either

249.519 --> 254.4
i thought that part was really annoying

252.72 --> 256.799
because it ruined kind of the great

254.4 --> 256.799
stream

262.24 --> 265.24
right

275.759 --> 278.16
also

276.639 --> 281.8
just saw the

278.16 --> 281.8
clip from jiren

283.28 --> 289.03999999999996
obama mentioning

285.28 --> 289.03999999999996
all the flatter things again

289.52 --> 293.19899999999996
like i like these clips because they

291.28 --> 294.96
they give you kind of a flashback into

293.199 --> 297.28000000000003
the past

294.96 --> 301.59999999999997
and they're not too long so yeah i'm

297.28 --> 303.75899999999996
really appreciating jaron's clips

301.6 --> 306.759
from past works

303.759 --> 306.759
huh

310.08 --> 313.68
oh yeah mitchell from australia

315.52 --> 319.59999999999997
another call-in show i think somebody

317.6 --> 321.759
did actually get in there if i'm not

319.6 --> 324.759
mistaken

321.759 --> 324.759
uh

326.08 --> 328.639
what's there

329.52 --> 333.28
let me

330.56 --> 334.96
flick through it

333.28 --> 337.44
but i was in chat

334.96 --> 338.79999999999995
and yeah it wasn't gonna come on there

337.44 --> 341.6
against

338.8 --> 341.6
as a clover

341.919 --> 344.56
oh yeah yeah

345.759 --> 351.039
yeah and i knew i remember that

348.32 --> 355.039
correctly yeah yeah it's a guy on called

351.039 --> 355.039
dane bear never heard of him before

355.36 --> 359.44
he came in at the last part of the show

365.28 --> 369.039
it's storm arwen is it

372.8 --> 375.199
really

379.759 --> 383.52000000000004
the one that was going to hit liverpool

384.319 --> 387.8
hey mike seduce

397.28 --> 403.11999999999995
i'd like to hear some from england

400.72 --> 405.759
like are they are they like

403.12 --> 406.96
in an even heavier

405.759 --> 409.039
storm

406.96 --> 411.68
right now because then it makes sense

409.039 --> 416.31899999999996
because then would mean kind of that

411.68 --> 418.16
i'm touching the outskirts of the storm

416.319 --> 420.24
because it's not really that heavy it's

418.16 --> 421.759
not like trees are constantly shaking

420.24 --> 423.12
and all that

421.759 --> 427.28000000000003
but

423.12 --> 427.28000000000003
there is it is blowing constantly

428.08 --> 430.4
anyway

431.52 --> 434.79999999999995
hey gadget inspector

435.68 --> 437.84000000000003
uh

456.72 --> 462.8
right so yeah what are you guys up to

459.759 --> 466.47900000000004
anything noteworthy

462.8 --> 466.479
happening yesterday

471.36 --> 476.319
i myself have been mostly playing games

476.84 --> 482.15999999999997
uh yeah well visiting the live streams

480.0 --> 484.16
like mitchells and all that

482.16 --> 486.8
flat earth debates

484.16 --> 486.8
premiere

489.44 --> 492.479
and

490.8 --> 496.039
you took a shower

492.479 --> 496.039
was really necessary

512.929 --> 516.249
[Music]

516.8 --> 520.1999999999999
great camera

527.6 --> 532.24
what

528.72 --> 535.24
sunny here northern uk okay

532.24 --> 535.24
weird

540.64 --> 546.12
you weren't well yesterday what do you

542.8 --> 546.12
mean jeff

556.0 --> 559.0
uh

594.8 --> 599.8
a fever type thing okay

609.36 --> 611.6800000000001
hmm

611.92 --> 615.68
well

613.2 --> 617.2
yeah maybe it's just the transition or

615.68 --> 618.8
something

617.2 --> 620.8000000000001
i mean

618.8 --> 622.8
i

620.8 --> 624.959
like for two days now i've been like

622.8 --> 626.4799999999999
feeling it in my back weirdly enough

624.959 --> 627.76
even though

626.48 --> 632.16
i've paid

627.76 --> 634.56
like really disciplinary care with that

632.16 --> 636.16
for a while because i just have so many

634.56 --> 638.64
memories of getting into trouble with my

636.16 --> 641.12
back because i didn't pay attention i've

638.64 --> 643.519
been really paying attention but now

641.12 --> 645.6
still it's like suddenly this

643.519 --> 647.519
these regions

645.6 --> 650.0790000000001
like from out of nowhere seem like

647.519 --> 653.279
cramped up

650.079 --> 653.279
but i'm not getting sick

653.36 --> 656.48
but there is something

656.959 --> 659.1999999999999
it's like

658.16 --> 663.1999999999999
like

659.2 --> 665.6800000000001
a tendency to get a little stiffy and

663.2 --> 667.9200000000001
that's why i am like stretching a lot

665.68 --> 670.079
like even during the show i do that a

667.92 --> 671.76
lot

670.079 --> 673.3599999999999
and it helps

671.76 --> 675.279
and i'm not embarrassed about it or

673.36 --> 677.36
anything

675.279 --> 679.6
because that would be a waste of my time

677.36 --> 682.5600000000001
i really need it

679.6 --> 686.48
i need to stay flexible

682.56 --> 686.4799999999999
it's also for the blood flow i think

686.8 --> 690.4799999999999
of course being a smoker

694.399 --> 699.12
you got to be even more careful

696.959 --> 701.3599999999999
if you have issues with that

699.12 --> 704.64
because smoking is not exactly good for

701.36 --> 704.64
the blood flow in general

704.8 --> 707.04
uh

710.48 --> 715.04
oh god

712.8 --> 720.16
gadget inspector sleeping warrior and

715.04 --> 720.16
bob magnetic stuff was was it live

720.88 --> 723.8389999999999
i heard that

722.24 --> 726.399
he was gonna do something like that i

723.839 --> 727.519
haven't seen it i didn't get any links

726.399 --> 729.44
from

727.519 --> 732.24
skype about it either

729.44 --> 734.9590000000001
or maybe he did post it and i just

732.24 --> 734.9590000000001
overlooked it

735.6 --> 737.839
no

738.079 --> 742.16
i don't see anything oh right oh and jim

741.36 --> 745.839
bob

742.16 --> 745.8389999999999
went on to infowars again

748.56 --> 753.92
it was a very long after show

752.079 --> 756.2399999999999
and then after that like i switched like

753.92 --> 759.519
oh let's check out what what's on

756.24 --> 761.92
the american journal on infowars and jim

759.519 --> 764.72
bob was just right there like oh hey

761.92 --> 764.7199999999999
hello again

768.72 --> 773.72
so yeah jim bob is making his rounds

774.079 --> 777.8389999999999
and representing pretty well

778.16 --> 782.7199999999999
uh

780.0 --> 785.44
but yeah sleeping warrior and bob

782.72 --> 787.9200000000001
magnetics like is it

785.44 --> 790.32
which bob

787.92 --> 793.12
i take like bob nodell i take it because

790.32 --> 793.12
he has his own

793.92 --> 796.4799999999999
stance

798.24 --> 806.399
concerning like previously

801.68 --> 806.399
the effect previously known as gravity

810.079 --> 814.6389999999999
pop node right right

812.16 --> 817.1999999999999
okay so so they went at it

814.639 --> 817.2
verbally

817.44 --> 821.9200000000001
like they were on a stream where when

819.199 --> 821.92
did that happen

827.6 --> 829.839
i

832.56 --> 837.0
i'm trying to look at my notifications

846.959 --> 851.68
like i'll check out sleeping warriors

849.279 --> 851.68
channel

854.0 --> 860.399
sit down there is it

857.6 --> 864.5600000000001
on glow busters or where where

860.399 --> 864.56
where is that stream is there a stream

864.8 --> 870.3199999999999
or did they just record it and then you

867.04 --> 873.5999999999999
got heard you heard about it afterward

870.32 --> 873.6
because they talked about it

876.639 --> 881.32
no

877.36 --> 881.32
it's not in sleeping warriors

889.199 --> 892.76
oh okay

902.399 --> 907.519
right so they're just back and forthing

904.56 --> 909.92
they didn't actually

907.519 --> 911.279
get together on one stream that was my

909.92 --> 914.639
question

911.279 --> 914.639
because that would be interesting

917.12 --> 921.279
but yeah you know tony

921.92 --> 926.639
like he

923.36 --> 928.88
like gravity and relative density really

926.639 --> 931.199
are his hill

928.88 --> 935.519
he did an experiment for that hill and

931.199 --> 935.519
now he's on that hill so yeah he's

938.16 --> 944.16
he's just defending the hill

940.72 --> 946.9590000000001
but it's a good hill to defend

944.16 --> 948.48
and yeah since bob is always trying to

946.959 --> 950.399
like

948.48 --> 954.0
uh

950.399 --> 955.759
reinvent gravity pretty much

954.0 --> 958.0
tony yes

955.759 --> 960.32
is always going to be poking him about

958.0 --> 960.32
that

964.959 --> 968.88
and everybody seems to be like going out

967.519 --> 970.88
and scouting

968.88 --> 973.4399999999999
for like a hunting mode

970.88 --> 975.12
the wolves are hungry you only have to

973.44 --> 977.0400000000001
point at somebody and then they're all

975.12 --> 978.399
just gonna attack because you pointed at

977.04 --> 980.639
it

978.399 --> 983.68
so everybody has like the tendency right

980.639 --> 986.0790000000001
now it seems me myself not so much i get

983.68 --> 989.12
very retractive because of

986.079 --> 991.12
the atmosphere the energy

989.12 --> 996.36
but a lot just go out and just pick

991.12 --> 996.36
targets and just start going at it

1004.0 --> 1009.88
on the last club was this okay so on

1006.88 --> 1009.88
sunday

1013.6 --> 1016.72
what's my opinion

1018.16 --> 1021.759
well i haven't seen that

1020.24 --> 1024.799
i haven't

1021.759 --> 1027.439
i don't well yeah i don't follow

1024.799 --> 1029.36
glowbusters

1027.439 --> 1031.3600000000001
like i'm completely barred from

1029.36 --> 1034.799
commenting there

1031.36 --> 1034.799
i don't really like it

1035.28 --> 1039.199
because of the way they all conduct

1037.199 --> 1042.799
themselves i don't like that

1039.199 --> 1042.799
it seems very outdated

1043.6 --> 1045.9189999999999
and

1048.24 --> 1052.64
yeah because of the implications of what

1050.4 --> 1056.16
they do there's like especially the

1052.64 --> 1058.48
technical flat earthers that i know

1056.16 --> 1061.2
from flat earth debate are like

1058.48 --> 1063.2
going after that but other than that

1061.2 --> 1064.799
i don't really find it all that

1063.2 --> 1067.8400000000001
interesting anymore i mean they've had

1064.799 --> 1067.84
really good days

1067.919 --> 1071.76
especially in the past but it's just

1073.52 --> 1078.12
yeah i'm just not interested right now

1081.84 --> 1087.36
seven seals revelation have i ever heard

1084.72 --> 1090.24
of that yeah grove rook i have

1087.36 --> 1090.24
ever heard of that

1092.48 --> 1096.64
it's part of the whole apocalypse

1097.2 --> 1102.32
predictions

1099.039 --> 1102.32
prophecies i should say

1116.16 --> 1121.88
everybody wants the belt yeah that's one

1118.24 --> 1121.88
way of saying it

1125.2 --> 1128.919
oh man

1143.44 --> 1147.8400000000001
did i see

1144.88 --> 1151.8400000000001
jaren's show the dating game i did see

1147.84 --> 1151.84
the notification but i didn't watch it

1174.0 --> 1180.64
darwin takes a genius level to in of

1178.24 --> 1182.72
intellect

1180.64 --> 1184.0
to even attempt to decode the seven

1182.72 --> 1185.52
seals

1184.0 --> 1186.96
but look

1185.52 --> 1189.039
like with

1186.96 --> 1192.88
every prophecy related thing it's just

1189.039 --> 1193.84
like what's your angle of approach

1192.88 --> 1196.0
what's

1193.84 --> 1198.6399999999999
the foundational structure you're going

1196.0 --> 1198.64
to use

1199.679 --> 1206.3200000000002
as a guide to interpret it right

1203.679 --> 1209.039
because of the multiple interpretation

1206.32 --> 1210.8799999999999
angles that a lot of bible stuff have in

1209.039 --> 1213.52
this case i'd say

1210.88 --> 1215.8400000000001
the seven seals is all about spirit

1213.52 --> 1218.84
energy it is

1215.84 --> 1218.84
about

1221.28 --> 1226.0
the energies

1223.679 --> 1229.039
the frequencies the connections like

1226.0 --> 1230.799
open up unleashed on the earth

1229.039 --> 1233.919
and with it what

1230.799 --> 1235.9189999999999
can potentially come and arrive within

1233.919 --> 1239.3600000000001
people through their

1235.919 --> 1239.3600000000001
soul through their consciousness

1239.52 --> 1244.32
that's how i kind of see the seven seals

1241.6 --> 1246.48
like it's like everything gets unchained

1244.32 --> 1250.08
like all the potential

1246.48 --> 1250.08
all the lids are taken off

1250.24 --> 1254.4
with all the problems that can come with

1252.24 --> 1257.76
it

1254.4 --> 1260.48
and that will come with it

1257.76 --> 1264.0
that's how i see the seven seals

1260.48 --> 1266.44
that's how i see the idea of gates

1264.0 --> 1269.28
and demons that have been so

1266.44 --> 1271.2
exoterized and used in myth

1269.28 --> 1273.76
and even in visuals

1271.2 --> 1277.039
sci-fi and fantasy things

1273.76 --> 1278.96
but i think that it's purely a spiritual

1277.039 --> 1283.12
occasion

1278.96 --> 1283.1200000000001
it's something that happens in the weave

1283.84 --> 1286.9599999999998
like

1284.64 --> 1289.44
in the dark world potentially like in

1286.96 --> 1291.1200000000001
where your spirit actually dwells that's

1289.44 --> 1294.48
where it happens

1291.12 --> 1294.4799999999998
not in the physical world

1300.08 --> 1303.76
anyway that's my take on that

1302.64 --> 1306.72
and a lot

1303.76 --> 1306.72
more relating

1307.52 --> 1309.76
right

1313.12 --> 1317.6
because people are recognizing the

1315.44 --> 1320.3200000000002
similarities right with situations in

1317.6 --> 1321.84
the real world

1320.32 --> 1324.6399999999999
but then still

1321.84 --> 1328.559
kind of attempting to exit terrorize it

1324.64 --> 1328.5590000000002
and make it mechanical again

1329.039 --> 1332.48
while

1330.4 --> 1335.039
what it's actually about is something

1332.48 --> 1336.799
that isn't so straightforward visually

1335.039 --> 1339.6
happening

1336.799 --> 1342.1589999999999
it's actually happening

1339.6 --> 1343.84
in the general feel

1342.159 --> 1346.4
of the people

1343.84 --> 1348.8799999999999
it's much more on a subconscious level

1346.4 --> 1352.0800000000002
in the dark world

1348.88 --> 1352.0800000000002
where the spirit dwells

1354.08 --> 1359.6789999999999
so they feel it they recognize it but

1357.12 --> 1361.36
then by force of habit start to exit

1359.679 --> 1364.3200000000002
terrorize again

1361.36 --> 1367.6789999999999
as the priests have taught

1364.32 --> 1370.32
the culture over multiple generations

1367.679 --> 1370.3200000000002
to do that

1370.88 --> 1375.679
to occupy yourself with interpreting it

1373.84 --> 1377.52
as a physical thing

1375.679 --> 1379.76
icons and

1377.52 --> 1382.1589999999999
architecture etc

1379.76 --> 1385.1589999999999
and to get distracted by that away from

1382.159 --> 1385.159
it

1398.4 --> 1403.1200000000001
to decode the seven seals will reveal

1400.96 --> 1404.96
all everything no

1403.12 --> 1406.8799999999999
it will take us what are you talking

1404.96 --> 1408.64
about

1406.88 --> 1411.2800000000002
what do you mean a thousand channel the

1408.64 --> 1414.44
next what you think that we can't figure

1411.28 --> 1414.44
it out

1418.72 --> 1421.44
what makes you think it's gonna take so

1420.559 --> 1424.9189999999999
long

1421.44 --> 1424.919
to get there

1434.4 --> 1440.3600000000001
i mean once you understand things go

1436.96 --> 1440.3600000000001
very quickly

1463.76 --> 1467.919
okay grow rock rook

1466.48 --> 1473.0
i do i don't know

1467.919 --> 1473.0
like what what what your context is here

1476.159 --> 1481.6000000000001
somebody brought up the seven seals

1478.799 --> 1485.279
i i tried to explain i think it's

1481.6 --> 1488.08
esoteric it's about energy frequency

1485.279 --> 1490.4
about where the spirit dwells

1488.08 --> 1493.1999999999998
so it is

1490.4 --> 1495.2
more like a mind representation for the

1493.2 --> 1497.44
mind to latch onto

1495.2 --> 1500.72
with visuals

1497.44 --> 1504.4
when in reality none of it is actually

1500.72 --> 1504.4
like physically mechanical

1506.159 --> 1510.1200000000001
it's purely energy

1515.679 --> 1522.5590000000002
right that's what makes it esoteric

1518.72 --> 1524.96
that's why it is symbolic

1522.559 --> 1527.52
because the symbolism is necessary to

1524.96 --> 1529.279
give some people that have trouble with

1527.52 --> 1531.679
seeing it like that

1529.279 --> 1533.52
to give them a basic premise framework

1531.679 --> 1536.5590000000002
like a little story

1533.52 --> 1539.44
that gives it some rigid context so they

1536.559 --> 1543.36
can keep oversight but none of it is

1539.44 --> 1545.679
literal you see it's all

1543.36 --> 1549.12
a symbolic representation of something

1545.679 --> 1549.1200000000001
that is very ethereal

1549.84 --> 1553.36
it's all spirit mechanics

1555.12 --> 1560.08
and yeah the only

1557.6 --> 1561.6
kind of reliable long-term way that

1560.08 --> 1563.84
humanity seemed to be able to

1561.6 --> 1565.039
communicate those things is through

1563.84 --> 1565.9189999999999
symbol

1565.039 --> 1568.0
through

1565.919 --> 1570.3200000000002
iconography

1568.0 --> 1573.52
symbolic representation to have the

1570.32 --> 1577.279
associations of the symbol be the guide

1573.52 --> 1580.9189999999999
for the understanding of the esoteric

1577.279 --> 1580.919
of of the ethereal

1591.679 --> 1593.919
hmm

1594.4 --> 1598.3200000000002
i hope

1596.24 --> 1600.24
i made my point it's a pretty complex

1598.32 --> 1602.799
point kind of out of nowhere

1600.24 --> 1607.24
but yeah somebody just started dropping

1602.799 --> 1607.24
seven seals that's pretty intense

1626.08 --> 1630.799
the beginning would be to actually

1628.559 --> 1630.799
why

1633.2 --> 1638.3990000000001
i know

1634.24 --> 1641.1200000000001
the rough context i know the rough setup

1638.399 --> 1644.08
for what what that story represents

1641.12 --> 1646.7199999999998
and i have an interpretation for it

1644.08 --> 1648.799
the interpretation is esoteric

1646.72 --> 1651.279
i've already given like

1648.799 --> 1653.679
another comparison like what if you just

1651.279 --> 1656.24
saw that those seals

1653.679 --> 1658.3990000000001
as like chains

1656.24 --> 1658.3990000000001
or

1658.96 --> 1663.44
pots with lids on them with like powers

1662.0 --> 1666.32
in them

1663.44 --> 1670.0800000000002
not necessarily good powers just like

1666.32 --> 1671.84
raw energy of some form some frequency

1670.08 --> 1675.24
that are then unleashed and it's

1671.84 --> 1678.24
unleashed on pretty much everybody

1675.24 --> 1680.88
simultaneously because it is like

1678.24 --> 1682.72
the weave of spirit that we all share

1680.88 --> 1684.88
with our spirit

1682.72 --> 1686.08
it's the frequency that's available to

1684.88 --> 1689.1200000000001
everybody

1686.08 --> 1689.12
that has sensories

1691.76 --> 1697.12
and i'm pretty sure that the animals and

1694.08 --> 1698.72
all that will also feel it

1697.12 --> 1700.8799999999999
like everything that's alive in the

1698.72 --> 1703.679
centuries feels that

1700.88 --> 1704.7990000000002
it's the energies that we share and like

1703.679 --> 1707.3600000000001
there's

1704.799 --> 1707.36
seals

1707.84 --> 1712.559
that seal off certain elements that are

1710.64 --> 1715.44
built within our design

1712.559 --> 1718.559
and when they become unsealed

1715.44 --> 1721.039
that really kind of changes everything

1718.559 --> 1725.2
changes the perception

1721.039 --> 1728.1589999999999
it changes like the impulses you have

1725.2 --> 1730.559
and thereby depending on how you draw

1728.159 --> 1731.919
your conclusions also the conclusions

1730.559 --> 1735.2
you draw because if you draw your

1731.919 --> 1737.5200000000002
conclusions based on contemporary

1735.2 --> 1739.8400000000001
feeling based interpretations and those

1737.52 --> 1741.6
feelings then change it's just like move

1739.84 --> 1743.76
switches

1741.6 --> 1746.32
that happen like transition from summer

1743.76 --> 1748.48
to autumn right the ancestral winds

1746.32 --> 1750.32
or if you're used to just

1748.48 --> 1753.039
making your decisions and judgments

1750.32 --> 1756.24
based on your feelings and suddenly one

1753.039 --> 1757.6
of the seals the grander seals is opened

1756.24 --> 1759.919
up

1757.6 --> 1761.4399999999998
then how would you even be able to

1759.919 --> 1763.1200000000001
predict what you're going to be like

1761.44 --> 1765.44
because of that

1763.12 --> 1767.039
if suddenly something big changed and

1765.44 --> 1768.559
with everybody

1767.039 --> 1771.12
it would be like whoa there's some

1768.559 --> 1773.039
mandela effect happening like everything

1771.12 --> 1775.84
changed but nobody

1773.039 --> 1775.84
understands it

1776.88 --> 1780.96
but everybody can feel that something

1778.799 --> 1784.32
like really is changed for the

1780.96 --> 1786.159
difference it become different

1784.32 --> 1788.6399999999999
right that's what i think that it would

1786.159 --> 1788.64
be like

1791.44 --> 1796.559
and i've probably felt some of those

1794.159 --> 1798.96
experience i think that seals have been

1796.559 --> 1798.96
opened

1800.96 --> 1805.279
throughout my life

1802.48 --> 1806.3990000000001
like in the world

1805.279 --> 1810.0
like

1806.399 --> 1810.0
seals have been open

1812.559 --> 1818.559
like at least one maybe two maybe three

1815.76 --> 1818.559
maybe more

1818.96 --> 1822.679
there's seven right

1824.24 --> 1831.36
but i have very distinct memories of

1828.0 --> 1836.2
very bizarre experiences in the world

1831.36 --> 1836.1999999999998
very much linear very much shared

1837.76 --> 1842.96
we're like it seems like the entire

1840.08 --> 1845.84
world is going crazy

1842.96 --> 1848.48
like there's a radical feeling

1845.84 --> 1850.6399999999999
shift like something really thick is in

1848.48 --> 1853.1200000000001
the air like holy [ __ ] something's about

1850.64 --> 1853.1200000000001
to happen

1853.76 --> 1856.24
and then

1857.519 --> 1861.679
like it just

1859.44 --> 1865.8400000000001
turns off again and everybody just

1861.679 --> 1865.8400000000001
pretends like nothing happened

1870.72 --> 1876.32
i can remember like two of those moments

1872.799 --> 1879.32
last one was in 2012 and it was so

1876.32 --> 1879.32
weird

1880.799 --> 1884.8799999999999
cops were in your street

1882.799 --> 1890.679
okay the big m

1884.88 --> 1890.679
cops like drive past here all the time

1895.679 --> 1900.96
okay crow rook well yeah you're not

1897.44 --> 1903.039
helping because that's not what i do

1900.96 --> 1905.039
you're gonna bring up the seven seals

1903.039 --> 1908.32
i'm gonna give you my

1905.039 --> 1910.72
insights on it that's what i do

1908.32 --> 1911.6
now if you don't agree with people doing

1910.72 --> 1913.6000000000001
that

1911.6 --> 1916.0
you might want to reconsider bringing up

1913.6 --> 1919.4399999999998
the subject in my show in my chat

1916.0 --> 1921.84
because i am going to respond to that

1919.44 --> 1924.64
the way that i do you should be

1921.84 --> 1924.6399999999999
expecting that

1925.36 --> 1933.039
i'm not however going to like

1928.399 --> 1933.039
agree with you and say like oh yeah i

1933.6 --> 1938.6399999999999
i should just not think about it and

1936.08 --> 1940.8799999999999
just read the bible

1938.64 --> 1943.2
all of that and then just don't think

1940.88 --> 1947.159
about it

1943.2 --> 1947.159
no not gonna do that

1949.36 --> 1952.36
ugh

1976.399 --> 1982.039
wow that's

1978.48 --> 1982.039
one hell of a name

2006.64 --> 2011.039
yeah

2008.0 --> 2013.519
yeah you see the whole thing

2011.039 --> 2015.919
like jeff gas had look this guy the

2013.519 --> 2018.64
bible was a funny sci-fi story

2015.919 --> 2020.3990000000001
yeah i'm gonna do my ballwin thing again

2018.64 --> 2024.64
on another level

2020.399 --> 2024.6399999999999
because i get it it's just that

2025.039 --> 2030.1589999999999
when somebody like that says the bible

2028.0 --> 2032.559
is a funny sci-fi story they don't

2030.159 --> 2037.0390000000002
realize that they

2032.559 --> 2037.039
believe in sci-fi stories

2041.36 --> 2045.1999999999998
right

2042.32 --> 2049.36
so you could switch those words around

2045.2 --> 2049.36
and then see a different approach

2049.839 --> 2056.0
our sci-fi stories

2052.72 --> 2056.0
are a funny bible

2057.04 --> 2061.44
because

2058.0 --> 2063.119
they believe in sci-fi stories

2061.44 --> 2065.679
so

2063.119 --> 2067.599
yeah we don't to so to us hearing

2065.679 --> 2069.04
something being declared a sci-fi story

2067.599 --> 2071.44
makes it fake

2069.04 --> 2073.2799999999997
well but they actually believe in sci-fi

2071.44 --> 2075.679
stories so to compare the bible to a

2073.28 --> 2078.0
sci-fi story is actually a compliment

2075.679 --> 2082.52
that's kind of

2078.0 --> 2082.52
weird when you think about it

2099.28 --> 2103.28
if you reference that to the glove oh so

2101.599 --> 2107.28
you're not a glober and you think that

2103.28 --> 2110.5600000000004
the bible is also sci-fi so

2107.28 --> 2110.5600000000004
where does that leave you

2113.92 --> 2118.48
so are you just like a nihilist a

2116.079 --> 2121.44
solipsist you just don't believe in

2118.48 --> 2125.68
anything it's all just a

2121.44 --> 2125.68
a black screen with a giant act

2126.32 --> 2131.44
and

2127.68 --> 2133.839
yeah it's the only thing that's on so

2131.44 --> 2134.64
that's it you're just wasting your life

2133.839 --> 2138.24
just

2134.64 --> 2142.2
perceiving things that are all fake

2138.24 --> 2142.2
sounds pretty dreary

2151.44 --> 2155.839
a free agent oh

2154.24 --> 2159.72
great freedom

2155.839 --> 2159.72
freedom of the void

2170.24 --> 2173.839
yeah have fun with that

2196.32 --> 2204.079
all right yeah freedom oh you're so free

2201.76 --> 2207.2000000000003
free from understanding free to be

2204.079 --> 2209.28
manipulated by things you don't realize

2207.2 --> 2211.5989999999997
you're doing yeah that's great freedom

2209.28 --> 2211.599
man

2212.0 --> 2218.079
it's certainly very relieving

2214.4 --> 2219.2000000000003
of the pressures of responsibility

2218.079 --> 2221.76
you know

2219.2 --> 2225.1189999999997
to think that you're free

2221.76 --> 2226.96
by thinking that everything is fake

2225.119 --> 2228.6400000000003
but yeah the problem is though not

2226.96 --> 2230.88
everything is fake

2228.64 --> 2232.0789999999997
it's just not

2230.88 --> 2234.88
all

2232.079 --> 2237.04
exactly what it seems like

2234.88 --> 2238.96
at first

2237.04 --> 2240.839
but like even all

2238.96 --> 2242.8
lies

2240.839 --> 2245.2
exist

2242.8 --> 2248.5600000000004
because it is a lie there's there's it's

2245.2 --> 2250.3999999999996
done a lie is done for a reason

2248.56 --> 2254.48
so it exists

2250.4 --> 2256.48
that makes it real it's just not

2254.48 --> 2258.64
believable

2256.48 --> 2262.16
but it exists so it has a reason to

2258.64 --> 2266.96
exist it has a motivation behind it

2262.16 --> 2266.96
it's a code of conduct an operation that

2267.839 --> 2271.48
nothing is fake

2278.72 --> 2282.48
everything has something real to it

2282.72 --> 2286.3999999999996
because if it doesn't

2285.359 --> 2290.16
then

2286.4 --> 2290.1600000000003
it can't grab your attention

2293.68 --> 2299.5989999999997
right sometimes you can hear something

2296.4 --> 2301.76
that's just preposterous

2299.599 --> 2303.92
that you don't agree with but because of

2301.76 --> 2306.96
the feelings that are driving that

2303.92 --> 2309.599
action people still find sympathy not

2306.96 --> 2312.0
for the argument but for the feelings

2309.599 --> 2314.0
behind it because those feelings are

2312.0 --> 2316.079
real and driving the person to say

2314.0 --> 2317.599
things in a certain way and people

2316.079 --> 2319.6800000000003
sympathize with that because they

2317.599 --> 2322.079
recognize the feeling

2319.68 --> 2327.16
and so they support something based on

2322.079 --> 2327.1600000000003
feeling not on technical argument

2329.44 --> 2334.96
so there is truth even in when it is

2332.48 --> 2337.359
nonsense

2334.96 --> 2340.0
because the nonsense is driven by

2337.359 --> 2342.16
motivation feelings

2340.0 --> 2344.24
and people can still sympathize and

2342.16 --> 2346.24
agree with those feelings even though

2344.24 --> 2348.24
the technicals that roll out are

2346.24 --> 2350.3999999999996
nonsense

2348.24 --> 2353.64
by those same people standards it's

2350.4 --> 2353.64
called sympathy

2363.839 --> 2367.48
hey elise g

2374.16 --> 2378.839
is jeff gas head in chat yeah

2382.16 --> 2385.68
can't see him

2384.079 --> 2389.2400000000002
really

2385.68 --> 2389.24
he has a wrench

2405.92 --> 2410.7200000000003
you don't have to subscribe to a

2407.92 --> 2413.44
particular idea or belief

2410.72 --> 2414.8799999999997
well who says you have to

2413.44 --> 2418.079
did i say that

2414.88 --> 2420.56
did i say you have to subscribe

2418.079 --> 2422.5600000000004
to an idea or belief no it's up to you

2420.56 --> 2424.88
it's your personal choice once you

2422.56 --> 2428.7999999999997
realize

2424.88 --> 2428.8
the choice what it really stands for

2429.92 --> 2433.52
right

2431.04 --> 2435.7599999999998
what about it do you believe what about

2433.52 --> 2437.599
it do you trust

2435.76 --> 2440.5600000000004
because if you're just gonna

2437.599 --> 2442.2400000000002
discard it all because oh

2440.56 --> 2443.68
it's fake

2442.24 --> 2446.4799999999996
like some

2443.68 --> 2449.9199999999996
thing about it or like oh it's like oh

2446.48 --> 2452.96
this story is made up well that means

2449.92 --> 2455.119
i'm gonna ignore all of it but what if

2452.96 --> 2459.04
it's actually a story that's based on

2455.119 --> 2461.599
something that's been real

2459.04 --> 2465.04
that contains like really refined

2461.599 --> 2467.3590000000004
communications and wisdom

2465.04 --> 2469.7599999999998
are you still gonna completely throw it

2467.359 --> 2474.0
in the garbage can because you figured

2469.76 --> 2474.0
out it didn't actually literally happen

2477.119 --> 2481.7200000000003
that seems very foolish and solipsistic

2483.04 --> 2487.92
that's freedom from information

2489.76 --> 2494.76
freedom from valuable data

2498.96 --> 2502.0
do you think you could why

2501.119 --> 2504.319
no

2502.0 --> 2504.319
what

2507.2 --> 2511.359
why the hell

2508.4 --> 2514.64
would i want to do that

2511.359 --> 2517.359
why why why would i like get involved

2514.64 --> 2519.92
with whatever that really is

2517.359 --> 2522.48
i'm not gonna just freaking open a bunch

2519.92 --> 2524.319
of seals because i potentially could

2522.48 --> 2526.88
somehow

2524.319 --> 2530.68
i'm not just gonna do that

2526.88 --> 2530.6800000000003
why would i do that

2537.92 --> 2542.2400000000002
i'm asking if i could

2539.839 --> 2542.24
maybe

2542.88 --> 2549.079
maybe i could

2545.119 --> 2549.079
why would i want to do that

2566.4 --> 2569.839
i don't think well i don't give a [ __ ]

2568.8 --> 2572.319
dude

2569.839 --> 2574.319
why do you ask

2572.319 --> 2576.24
you're asking me if i could i say yeah i

2574.319 --> 2577.599
might be able to i don't think you could

2576.24 --> 2580.319
well

2577.599 --> 2581.839
well i don't care dude why did you even

2580.319 --> 2585.52
ask

2581.839 --> 2588.0
i never even asked you to ask

2585.52 --> 2592.44
i'm not a lamb of god

2588.0 --> 2592.44
the [ __ ] does that have to do with it

2593.359 --> 2596.88
do you even know what that means

2598.16 --> 2604.16
to expose me oh guys oh look at that i'm

2601.92 --> 2609.8
being exposed

2604.16 --> 2609.7999999999997
hello hello i'm being exposed

2613.599 --> 2620.48
can decode the seal well that's cool so

2616.56 --> 2623.04
what is the lamb of god crow rook

2620.48 --> 2626.839
it's really cool that you know that so

2623.04 --> 2626.839
well what is it

2644.079 --> 2649.28
oh yeah but you don't you haven't proven

2647.359 --> 2651.52
to me that i'm not the lamb of god what

2649.28 --> 2653.8390000000004
is it what is that

2651.52 --> 2655.52
do you know grow rook or are you just

2653.839 --> 2657.2
blabbering some

2655.52 --> 2658.24
chance that you don't actually

2657.2 --> 2662.2
understand

2658.24 --> 2662.2
very typical if you would

2663.44 --> 2669.92
now don't tell me to read the bible i'm

2666.4 --> 2672.48
asking you for your understanding of

2669.92 --> 2676.16
that word since you rest your entire

2672.48 --> 2678.2400000000002
case of exposing me on that you're

2676.16 --> 2681.1189999999997
accusing me of something that i'm asking

2678.24 --> 2684.64
you to elaborate on what that means

2681.119 --> 2684.6400000000003
you the accuser

2684.8 --> 2687.599
crow rook

2688.079 --> 2692.48
smells a sucked yeah definitely

2690.48 --> 2695.119
somebody's opening up a stinky drawer

2692.48 --> 2698.28
for sure but

2695.119 --> 2698.28
you know

2714.72 --> 2718.7999999999997
it's just so boring like this dude

2717.2 --> 2721.4399999999996
you're accusing me of something now

2718.8 --> 2725.3590000000004
could you please elaborate on the exit

2721.44 --> 2727.68
on the exact nature of the accusation

2725.359 --> 2730.319
right if you're gonna accuse me of

2727.68 --> 2733.1189999999997
pretending to be something or some then

2730.319 --> 2736.24
at least tell me what that something is

2733.119 --> 2736.2400000000002
you imbecile

2738.64 --> 2741.359
your cult

2740.0 --> 2743.2
idiot

2741.359 --> 2745.2
you don't even know

2743.2 --> 2747.839
what you're saying you're literally

2745.2 --> 2747.839
using

2748.72 --> 2754.0
words and sentences that you don't

2751.52 --> 2756.0
understand what they are

2754.0 --> 2757.359
and you think you can attack somebody

2756.0 --> 2759.44
over that

2757.359 --> 2762.48
when you literally don't understand the

2759.44 --> 2766.319
words you're using in your accusation

2762.48 --> 2766.319
that's really pitiful dude

2770.48 --> 2775.92
besides i never really said

2773.2 --> 2778.319
i'm certain i could do it or like i said

2775.92 --> 2779.599
like well maybe i could i don't know for

2778.319 --> 2783.92
sure

2779.599 --> 2786.079
i mean i'm very confident about myself

2783.92 --> 2788.0
and my abilities

2786.079 --> 2789.119
they reach they're pretty good at what i

2788.0 --> 2790.64
do

2789.119 --> 2793.44
even though it's

2790.64 --> 2795.2
like yeah

2793.44 --> 2796.88
it will be very elusive to some people

2795.2 --> 2799.7599999999998
some people just won't be able to see

2796.88 --> 2803.04
what i can do and that's fine

2799.76 --> 2804.3190000000004
don't want to burden them but maybe i

2803.04 --> 2807.839
can

2804.319 --> 2810.72
right i figured out that most things

2807.839 --> 2812.88
can be mastered and wielded if you

2810.72 --> 2814.8799999999997
understand and are willing to take the

2812.88 --> 2816.48
responsibility that comes with the

2814.88 --> 2819.28
understanding and that is really the

2816.48 --> 2819.28
punishing part

2820.4 --> 2823.599
and tuition knows that and that is why a

2822.319 --> 2827.119
lot of people

2823.599 --> 2828.8
choose not to understand

2827.119 --> 2830.8
because of the punishment not because

2828.8 --> 2832.88
they can't understand it's because of

2830.8 --> 2835.28
the punishment they avoid

2832.88 --> 2835.28
anyway

2835.359 --> 2839.2
if you say it has to be the lamb of god

2837.28 --> 2840.8
well what is that then

2839.2 --> 2842.839
i'm pretty sure it's not going to be a

2840.8 --> 2845.599
literal lamb

2842.839 --> 2848.7999999999997
right because if that's the case then

2845.599 --> 2851.2000000000003
keep the sheep away from the doors

2848.8 --> 2851.2000000000003
you know

2851.44 --> 2855.04
but

2852.96 --> 2856.7200000000003
maybe it's something else something

2855.04 --> 2858.64
specific something

2856.72 --> 2860.8799999999997
energy related maybe you have to be in

2858.64 --> 2863.44
the right frequency maybe you have to be

2860.88 --> 2865.839
walking the path in a certain way maybe

2863.44 --> 2868.2400000000002
that is what it indicates i don't know i

2865.839 --> 2869.52
haven't received any explanation about

2868.24 --> 2871.4399999999996
it

2869.52 --> 2872.96
so whatsoever from this guy that

2871.44 --> 2876.7200000000003
actually

2872.96 --> 2879.04
used it in his accusation of me

2876.72 --> 2879.04
right

2883.119 --> 2887.839
so are you gonna get back to me about

2884.96 --> 2887.839
that crow rook

2889.2 --> 2892.0789999999997
or that was it

2894.8 --> 2899.119
you asked me a

2897.2 --> 2900.3999999999996
a chant

2899.119 --> 2902.7200000000003
question

2900.4 --> 2904.4
like a chant trick question that you

2902.72 --> 2906.8799999999997
don't really understand but it's like a

2904.4 --> 2911.76
book you ask a question oh if somebody

2906.88 --> 2913.2000000000003
answers that wrong then they are bad

2911.76 --> 2915.2000000000003
why

2913.2 --> 2916.7999999999997
do you understand

2915.2 --> 2918.0789999999997
what you're asking do you understand

2916.8 --> 2920.0
what that is

2918.079 --> 2922.2400000000002
i mean i would have been asked about

2920.0 --> 2923.44
what are the seven seals before i had an

2922.24 --> 2925.359
elaborate

2923.44 --> 2926.88
response to that

2925.359 --> 2929.119
a view on it

2926.88 --> 2931.2000000000003
that tried to help people understand how

2929.119 --> 2932.96
i see that

2931.2 --> 2935.68
but then

2932.96 --> 2938.16
suddenly this lamp thing and oh how dare

2935.68 --> 2940.0
i say that i might be able to do

2938.16 --> 2944.16
something with the seals

2940.0 --> 2945.52
how dare i well how do you know how dare

2944.16 --> 2947.7599999999998
i

2945.52 --> 2950.64
if you don't even understand

2947.76 --> 2953.28
what the freaking lamb is

2950.64 --> 2956.52
you left the chat uh

2953.28 --> 2956.52
so annoying

2964.16 --> 2967.7599999999998
i mean i'm

2965.52 --> 2970.92
i'm ready to be accused here i'm ready

2967.76 --> 2970.92
for people

2971.52 --> 2977.2
to basically say that i am

2974.48 --> 2978.88
evil or the devil or whatever

2977.2 --> 2981.4399999999996
make your case

2978.88 --> 2983.44
i'm serious you you want to be a

2981.44 --> 2985.68
persecutor for god you think that you're

2983.44 --> 2987.28
an inquisitor

2985.68 --> 2990.16
right here

2987.28 --> 2990.1600000000003
make your case

2990.72 --> 2994.5989999999997
and i will make mine

3004.48 --> 3010.079
the term lamb refers to a sacrifice

3007.839 --> 3010.96
so only somebody

3010.079 --> 3012.48
what

3010.96 --> 3015.44
so that's only somebody that is

3012.48 --> 3017.52
sacrificed or it is the return of jesus

3015.44 --> 3018.88
logical conclusion thank you by the way

3017.52 --> 3020.64
for at least

3018.88 --> 3022.319
trying to

3020.64 --> 3025.04
answer it

3022.319 --> 3026.96
so the lamb of god is like the return of

3025.04 --> 3029.04
jesus is he

3026.96 --> 3032.8
so

3029.04 --> 3032.8
is that in the physical world

3033.52 --> 3037.28
where

3035.599 --> 3038.7200000000003
where are the seals where are they

3037.28 --> 3041.599
physically

3038.72 --> 3043.839
or they're not anywhere physically

3041.599 --> 3043.839
so

3044.24 --> 3050.7999999999997
the lamb of god would be

3046.96 --> 3052.8
like the spirit of jesus

3050.8 --> 3056.079
which i presume is like on the other

3052.8 --> 3058.319
side where i think the seals are

3056.079 --> 3061.96
not in the physical world

3058.319 --> 3061.96
because it's all spiritual

3068.0 --> 3072.72
all right so

3069.599 --> 3072.7200000000003
what if jesus

3073.359 --> 3078.72
right returns through us like our

3076.559 --> 3081.119
ascension is basically we're walking the

3078.72 --> 3083.5989999999997
path as jesus

3081.119 --> 3084.8
did show us

3083.599 --> 3087.76
and we

3084.8 --> 3090.1600000000003
basically tried to do something similar

3087.76 --> 3092.4
in our own time in our own way with our

3090.16 --> 3093.44
own problems right because we are not

3092.4 --> 3095.119
like him

3093.44 --> 3098.319
nobody is

3095.119 --> 3099.2000000000003
presumed to be like him because he

3098.319 --> 3100.88
seemed

3099.2 --> 3104.0
very infallible

3100.88 --> 3104.0
elusively so

3106.319 --> 3111.359
but he still did predict that those that

3109.2 --> 3113.5989999999997
would follow

3111.359 --> 3118.24
they would even like

3113.599 --> 3118.2400000000002
grow beyond his capabilities

3118.72 --> 3122.839
in a good way

3120.559 --> 3125.3590000000004
so if you go by

3122.839 --> 3127.119
those standards

3125.359 --> 3130.16
that way of thinking then i would

3127.119 --> 3131.6800000000003
conclude that jesus returns through us

3130.16 --> 3134.3999999999996
through

3131.68 --> 3135.359
those who actually follow what he's he's

3134.4 --> 3139.76
done

3135.359 --> 3142.4
that way not forming like churches and

3139.76 --> 3143.92
re and being eclectic being finding god

3142.4 --> 3147.04
inside

3143.92 --> 3151.96
taking the challenge for real

3147.04 --> 3151.96
like facing the challenges inside

3152.48 --> 3156.64
but jesus wasn't sacrificing that

3156.88 --> 3162.8
well i think that the idea that

3159.76 --> 3165.44
god would sacrifice like the creator

3162.8 --> 3167.52
himself would sacrifice is preposterous

3165.44 --> 3169.839
to me like i don't agree i think that

3167.52 --> 3169.839
wasn't

3172.559 --> 3177.92
on that whole ordeal again right

3175.76 --> 3181.119
i think that saying that jesus died for

3177.92 --> 3183.76
our sins is atrocious

3181.119 --> 3186.079
i think it is the perfect distraction to

3183.76 --> 3187.76
distract the way from what he what

3186.079 --> 3192.2000000000003
actually mattered and that is the way

3187.76 --> 3192.2000000000003
that he lived and what he showed us

3197.68 --> 3202.0
and i think that this emphasis on

3199.44 --> 3204.8
sacrifice to change the design is

3202.0 --> 3206.839
absolutely absurd because why would the

3204.8 --> 3210.0
designer have

3206.839 --> 3211.68
to perform like this weird earthly

3210.0 --> 3214.16
ritual

3211.68 --> 3216.96
which is very gross

3214.16 --> 3216.96
in order to

3217.119 --> 3223.28
change the design he is the designer

3221.839 --> 3225.839
makes no

3223.28 --> 3229.119
sense it makes absolutely no sense

3225.839 --> 3231.68
whatsoever from an architectural

3229.119 --> 3233.44
point of view

3231.68 --> 3235.68
so i think that

3233.44 --> 3238.88
the right for our sins is actually a

3235.68 --> 3241.7599999999998
devilishly concocted

3238.88 --> 3241.76
distraction

3242.16 --> 3246.319
away from his actual teachings

3246.4 --> 3251.119
that's the thing that

3247.72 --> 3254.5589999999997
encapsulates his teachings

3251.119 --> 3254.559
to distract away from it

3263.599 --> 3268.0
so he's not the lamb of god in that case

3270.079 --> 3274.48
well

3270.88 --> 3277.76
maybe a lamp could be

3274.48 --> 3279.68
seen outside of sacrificial context

3277.76 --> 3281.28
couldn't you

3279.68 --> 3284.96
i mean

3281.28 --> 3290.2400000000002
would jesus himself see lambs

3284.96 --> 3292.559
per definition as a symbol for sacrifice

3290.24 --> 3294.72
would he or would he actually see

3292.559 --> 3297.28
something different mainly the lamb's

3294.72 --> 3297.2799999999997
innocence

3297.52 --> 3302.319
the innocent spirit

3299.92 --> 3302.319
of it

3305.68 --> 3307.839
right

3313.839 --> 3318.319
like from my

3315.44 --> 3320.319
spiritual deep diving and trying to

3318.319 --> 3322.48
figure out like what is this spirit of

3320.319 --> 3324.4
christ what is that really and how is

3322.48 --> 3326.2400000000002
this being encapsulated i think that

3324.4 --> 3328.7200000000003
jesus

3326.24 --> 3330.799
this is my personal

3328.72 --> 3334.0789999999997
interpretation i think that he would be

3330.799 --> 3336.72
just like really annoyed and outraged

3334.079 --> 3339.599
about how christians

3336.72 --> 3342.64
have basically used his legacy

3339.599 --> 3344.799
and how it has been encapsulated by this

3342.64 --> 3347.92
priesthood this church that he tried to

3344.799 --> 3348.96
warn about church formation warn against

3347.92 --> 3351.76
it

3348.96 --> 3354.0
keep the church in yourself

3351.76 --> 3356.079
don't give away your spiritual authority

3354.0 --> 3356.96
to another

3356.079 --> 3359.04
don't

3356.96 --> 3360.88
be part of that sort of a hierarchy

3359.04 --> 3363.599
thing

3360.88 --> 3365.92
and don't start using don't start

3363.599 --> 3367.92
selling things in your church don't make

3365.92 --> 3371.88
it about business

3367.92 --> 3371.88
right all these basics

3394.96 --> 3397.96
huh

3405.44 --> 3412.16
all right gadget inspector

3408.24 --> 3412.16
right vision right it's a vision

3412.88 --> 3418.48
that sounds incredibly esoteric to me

3415.839 --> 3420.319
that sounds dark world experience to me

3418.48 --> 3422.72
that doesn't mean it's not real

3420.319 --> 3426.52
absolutely

3422.72 --> 3426.52
seems very important

3435.359 --> 3438.359
huh

3449.2 --> 3452.96
not that i believe a word but

3450.96 --> 3454.88
theologists

3452.96 --> 3457.839
yeah but that's the whole issue is

3454.88 --> 3457.839
theologists

3457.92 --> 3460.7200000000003
what

3459.28 --> 3464.88
the

3460.72 --> 3467.04
the priesthood of theology decide

3464.88 --> 3469.359
through consensus

3467.04 --> 3471.359
through their

3469.359 --> 3474.88
group of scientists you could say

3471.359 --> 3476.4
biblical scientists almost they decide

3474.88 --> 3478.48
that lamp

3476.4 --> 3480.799
just means

3478.48 --> 3483.359
jesus because of the sacrifice well yeah

3480.799 --> 3486.16
that's not surprising when all of those

3483.359 --> 3488.16
theologists are like submerged

3486.16 --> 3490.48
in like the primary conditioning and

3488.16 --> 3493.68
that is yeah jesus died for your sins

3490.48 --> 3495.68
just died for sin decide yeah that's

3493.68 --> 3496.72
because of that

3495.68 --> 3500.24
right

3496.72 --> 3504.0789999999997
it's a very simple conclusion to draw

3500.24 --> 3504.0789999999997
based on that conditioning

3508.0 --> 3516.96
it's like it narrows it all down

3512.24 --> 3520.4799999999996
so it changes the direction of you

3516.96 --> 3522.559
to just that like everything everything

3520.48 --> 3523.44
becomes just like only thing that

3522.559 --> 3525.8390000000004
matters

3523.44 --> 3528.559
is like everything came

3525.839 --> 3531.359
towards and came from the moment of

3528.559 --> 3534.2400000000002
sacrifice like it is everything

3531.359 --> 3534.24
that's what it does

3535.599 --> 3539.3590000000004
literally it's like literally portrayed

3538.079 --> 3542.96
as like this

3539.359 --> 3544.96
sacrifice literally changed the very

3542.96 --> 3546.079
fabric of creation

3544.96 --> 3547.359
okay

3546.079 --> 3548.88
yeah

3547.359 --> 3550.48
if you're going to put that kind of a

3548.88 --> 3553.28
weight on something

3550.48 --> 3553.28
it's going to be

3554.0 --> 3559.44
everything is going to be crystallized

3556.48 --> 3561.04
around that concept

3559.44 --> 3564.16
have you considered that maybe that

3561.04 --> 3567.04
concept is the problem

3564.16 --> 3572.2799999999997
because hey the wisdom of jesus is

3567.04 --> 3572.2799999999997
palpable in the words even separated

3573.68 --> 3580.0789999999997
right that's where the empirical results

3577.119 --> 3583.04
are like that's valuable it's still it's

3580.079 --> 3585.04
recognizably valuable right now this

3583.04 --> 3588.5589999999997
sacrifice [ __ ] is all just a bunch of

3585.04 --> 3593.359
mystical mumbo-jumbo

3588.559 --> 3595.599
and like a divine glorification of

3593.359 --> 3599.359
a primary sin

3595.599 --> 3601.04
freaking human sacrifice god

3599.359 --> 3602.16
how can't you see it

3601.04 --> 3604.799
like oh

3602.16 --> 3607.44
nobody could ever do that but

3604.799 --> 3609.599
god just had to do it that one time

3607.44 --> 3611.76
really he had to

3609.599 --> 3613.2000000000003
makes no sense he's the freaking

3611.76 --> 3615.5200000000004
designer

3613.2 --> 3617.5989999999997
he can do miracles

3615.52 --> 3620.16
how could he not just

3617.599 --> 3622.6400000000003
change the rules just like that why

3620.16 --> 3627.319
would it have to be accompanied by some

3622.64 --> 3627.319
sacrifice it makes no sense

3635.359 --> 3640.16
yes logical conclusion i know it is a

3638.24 --> 3643.839
priesthood

3640.16 --> 3643.839
that's the whole issue theologists

3644.64 --> 3648.48
yeah they're not priests they're like

3646.72 --> 3652.16
scientists

3648.48 --> 3652.16
studying their religion

3652.319 --> 3659.04
they're not exactly there to give it

3654.96 --> 3659.04
purpose they're rather there to

3659.44 --> 3667.2000000000003
basically explain it away culturally

3664.48 --> 3670.319
like this means that that means that

3667.2 --> 3672.64
so theologists often break become more

3670.319 --> 3675.119
focused on the culture

3672.64 --> 3679.2
of the religion and basically what the

3675.119 --> 3682.319
priests do what they believe how they

3679.2 --> 3682.319
understand things

3683.04 --> 3687.52
and like what do these words actually

3685.599 --> 3688.319
mean according to the priests in the

3687.52 --> 3691.2
book

3688.319 --> 3691.2
instead of like

3692.079 --> 3695.92
realizing that the whole priesthood was

3694.16 --> 3698.72
kind of the problem in the first place

3695.92 --> 3700.559
not the book

3698.72 --> 3702.64
not the informations the priesthood and

3700.559 --> 3705.0400000000004
their interpretation

3702.64 --> 3706.799
that have basically detracted away from

3705.04 --> 3708.799
its true power

3706.799 --> 3710.799
and then the theologists they focused

3708.799 --> 3713.44
more on the priesthood interpretation

3710.799 --> 3715.52
instead of the actual original book and

3713.44 --> 3718.319
they don't respect it

3715.52 --> 3718.319
a lot of the time

3718.48 --> 3725.52
it's kind of funny i should know

3721.2 --> 3729.4399999999996
my first ex-girlfriend is a theologist

3725.52 --> 3729.44
fully studied graduated

3730.799 --> 3736.079
and she is atheist

3733.44 --> 3737.92
like hardcore

3736.079 --> 3739.8390000000004
she's like she's never gonna

3737.92 --> 3741.839
have that

3739.839 --> 3745.7599999999998
undone i tried

3741.839 --> 3748.0
like she's like it can't be done

3745.76 --> 3750.4
do i know betty

3748.0 --> 3753.799
from kiwi in person no never met her

3750.4 --> 3753.799
gadget inspector

3755.44 --> 3759.039
i don't know what she looks like even

3766.079 --> 3769.8390000000004
yes

3766.96 --> 3769.839
she is dutch

3770.559 --> 3775.559
but not exactly like next door neighbor

3786.799 --> 3790.96
maybe because there was one good man

3789.039 --> 3793.599
willing to lay down no but that's the

3790.96 --> 3796.4
entire propaganda

3793.599 --> 3800.4
to play into that longing

3796.4 --> 3803.119
of basically a man wanting to

3800.4 --> 3804.7200000000003
well sacrifice themselves for their

3803.119 --> 3808.4
group right

3804.72 --> 3808.3999999999996
like that honor sensation

3808.799 --> 3814.24
that's what's what it's there for that's

3812.0 --> 3816.72
what it's tr like it's trying to

3814.24 --> 3820.3999999999996
distract away from hey be focused be

3816.72 --> 3822.3999999999996
careful be careful not playing into your

3820.4 --> 3824.559
longings into the seductions the

3822.4 --> 3827.2000000000003
teachings of christ and instead like oh

3824.559 --> 3830.1600000000003
it's all about the sacrifice and you too

3827.2 --> 3832.8799999999997
can sacrifice yourself for your country

3830.16 --> 3835.2
perhaps or something you know or

3832.88 --> 3838.079
the pope's army

3835.2 --> 3840.319
yeah

3838.079 --> 3842.079
quite contradicting to christ's

3840.319 --> 3843.2799999999997
teachings really

3842.079 --> 3845.119
like that

3843.28 --> 3847.76
like it's all about the sacrifice to

3845.119 --> 3849.76
just play into those those longings like

3847.76 --> 3852.48
i want to mean something i

3849.76 --> 3854.48
i'll give i'll give everything for the

3852.48 --> 3858.0
group

3854.48 --> 3858.0
to play into that instinct

3860.24 --> 3867.64
it's manipulation

3863.359 --> 3867.64
it's priesthood trickery

3870.559 --> 3874.559
you too can be a special boy that can

3872.64 --> 3876.72
die for us

3874.559 --> 3878.96
and you'll be glorified

3876.72 --> 3881.4399999999996
it's it's like the oldest priesthood

3878.96 --> 3884.2400000000002
trick in the book that's

3881.44 --> 3886.0
how the nobility even used to rule their

3884.24 --> 3888.799
people

3886.0 --> 3890.48
around the world in ancient times

3888.799 --> 3892.72
just the kings they would just declare

3890.48 --> 3892.72
like

3893.52 --> 3897.68
you you your meaning your life can have

3896.16 --> 3899.839
meaning

3897.68 --> 3901.9199999999996
if somebody steps up and does this

3899.839 --> 3904.319
glorious thing we'll like have the bards

3901.92 --> 3907.44
write stories about you and i will

3904.319 --> 3907.44
promise to honor you

3907.599 --> 3911.44
and people would do that that's a

3909.44 --> 3914.88
priesthood trick that's playing into the

3911.44 --> 3917.359
longing of somebody just

3914.88 --> 3919.44
really that basically ready to squirt

3917.359 --> 3921.68
they want to apply themselves they want

3919.44 --> 3923.44
to be recognized their ego needs things

3921.68 --> 3926.799
they want to do things

3923.44 --> 3926.799
and then you play into that

3928.799 --> 3932.24
that's how rulers ruled

3932.559 --> 3937.2000000000003
it's a priesthood trick

3934.72 --> 3938.48
right that's why originally kings and

3937.2 --> 3941.0389999999998
queens were

3938.48 --> 3943.68
presumed to be a

3941.039 --> 3945.3590000000004
like a pope basically like they had the

3943.68 --> 3947.2799999999997
authority of god

3945.359 --> 3949.2799999999997
they had the connection

3947.28 --> 3951.44
so if they would call forth somebody to

3949.28 --> 3952.799
sacrifice themselves it would be like oh

3951.44 --> 3955.92
yeah but

3952.799 --> 3955.92
god commands me

3958.16 --> 3962.48
right

3959.76 --> 3964.4
so yeah those tricks haven't really gone

3962.48 --> 3968.559
away it's just the setup

3964.4 --> 3968.559
for its applications have changed

3968.96 --> 3973.92
rulers don't do it like that anymore

3971.119 --> 3976.4
although it seems like this neoliberal

3973.92 --> 3978.16
beast insanity system is kind of

3976.4 --> 3979.44
attempting that from a dark side

3978.16 --> 3982.68
perspective

3979.44 --> 3982.68
it's crazy

4010.48 --> 4015.44
yeah now a clutch yeah that's a

4012.24 --> 4018.5589999999997
complicated situation that one but it is

4015.44 --> 4022.2400000000002
very resolvable and that is like

4018.559 --> 4024.6400000000003
in a city like sodom

4022.24 --> 4027.839
there the point is there can't be any

4024.64 --> 4030.48
good men living there not really

4027.839 --> 4034.52
because if you can

4030.48 --> 4034.52
survive that mentally

4034.559 --> 4037.599
then you're not good

4038.88 --> 4044.48
any good person would flee that

4042.24 --> 4046.4799999999996
so it's kind of in my opinion a trick

4044.48 --> 4049.359
question would but if there would be

4046.48 --> 4050.64
this many good men that many well no

4049.359 --> 4052.5589999999997
they can't

4050.64 --> 4056.24
they would have already fled that place

4052.559 --> 4059.2000000000003
because it's a pit of horrors

4056.24 --> 4062.16
because if you stay you become

4059.2 --> 4065.5989999999997
dragged down into hell with it then

4062.16 --> 4066.48
you're one of it you become it

4065.599 --> 4070.3590000000004
so

4066.48 --> 4070.359
that's how i see that

4088.319 --> 4095.119
do you understand my plight clutch

4091.52 --> 4095.119
getting all very biblical today

4100.56 --> 4105.64
oh man

4102.239 --> 4105.639999999999
it's been raining

4134.08 --> 4138.88
find ourselves in where to flee no but

4136.56 --> 4142.56
it's not the same situation right

4138.88 --> 4144.159000000001
because sodom was a place you could flee

4142.56 --> 4145.52
away from it

4144.159 --> 4147.92
and you would

4145.52 --> 4149.52
now if all the places were like sodom

4147.92 --> 4152.159
literally everywhere and there would be

4149.52 --> 4154.56
no place like not even like in the

4152.159 --> 4158.839
middle of nowhere in the forest if even

4154.56 --> 4160.56
the if even the sodom agents are there

4158.839 --> 4162.0
right

4160.56 --> 4164.080000000001
then

4162.0 --> 4166.08
you don't just give up and convert no

4164.08 --> 4169.12
that's when you actually

4166.08 --> 4172.159
basically start a spiritual civil war

4169.12 --> 4174.64
kind of situation and you just

4172.159 --> 4176.3189999999995
you ground you defend and you try to

4174.64 --> 4178.719
build an alternative culture that

4176.319 --> 4180.88
ignores it all

4178.719 --> 4184.319
but you have to actively defend against

4180.88 --> 4186.96
it because that culture will

4184.319 --> 4190.719
like the sodom culture will literally

4186.96 --> 4190.719
attack you for it

4194.64 --> 4197.84
right it's very dangerous

4199.84 --> 4204.0
but yeah

4201.76 --> 4205.76
i think that the whole sodom

4204.0 --> 4206.719
and gomorrah

4205.76 --> 4208.4800000000005
with

4206.719 --> 4211.52
what if there were this many good men i

4208.48 --> 4214.959999999999
think it's a trick question because

4211.52 --> 4217.6
if you could have fled it

4214.96 --> 4220.4
it went to another place

4217.6 --> 4222.88
then there is no logical way that a good

4220.4 --> 4225.28
person would be forced to stay there

4222.88 --> 4227.76
otherwise other than by being

4225.28 --> 4227.759999999999
captured

4228.56 --> 4231.84
beartaria yeah yeah

4292.88 --> 4299.88
right what were we talking about again

4296.719 --> 4299.88
oh yeah

4303.12 --> 4306.64
started out about the lamb

4308.48 --> 4312.5599999999995
talked about the priesthood about how

4310.4 --> 4313.679
christ comes through us

4312.56 --> 4317.04
i think

4313.679 --> 4317.04
as he basically predicted

4317.679 --> 4323.64
and then you brought on

4320.0 --> 4323.64
saturday more

4330.8 --> 4336.0
right but yeah bry what you said

4333.52 --> 4338.4800000000005
same situation we found found ourselves

4336.0 --> 4340.48
in today where to flee

4338.48 --> 4343.04
well it's different

4340.48 --> 4345.44
because back then

4343.04 --> 4348.64
they could have fled it was a place you

4345.44 --> 4348.639999999999
could flee that place

4350.88 --> 4354.92
just live in another region

4372.8 --> 4375.8
anyway

4392.08 --> 4396.12
sheesh it's so dark

4404.4 --> 4409.719
i want a bit of light is this gonna help

4412.719 --> 4420.44
ah just makes me look me yellow

4416.48 --> 4420.44
oh i'm a yellow man

4449.6 --> 4453.159000000001
right so guys

4454.88 --> 4458.08
is there anything else

4458.159 --> 4460.4
what

4460.48 --> 4464.919999999999
part simpson what the hell

4489.199 --> 4496.12
oh red yellow man yeah

4492.56 --> 4496.120000000001
not that yellow

4527.84 --> 4533.2390000000005
john this what

4529.76 --> 4533.2390000000005
is that a color

4545.36 --> 4550.839999999999
nasa is going to fly a spacecraft into

4547.679 --> 4550.84
an asteroid

4553.36 --> 4558.08
like to take samples

4555.76 --> 4560.2390000000005
supposedly

4558.08 --> 4564.0
i mean a while back they like

4560.239 --> 4566.32
shot some kind of projectile

4564.0 --> 4568.56
at an asteroid for some reason or was it

4566.32 --> 4570.88
a comet

4568.56 --> 4573.6
like they even created this supposed

4570.88 --> 4573.6
footage of that

4574.4 --> 4578.5599999999995
so are they gonna do

4576.32 --> 4582.799999999999
something again

4578.56 --> 4585.4400000000005
are they actually gonna supposedly land

4582.8 --> 4585.4400000000005
the craft

4592.719 --> 4596.96
as training for earth defense

4598.96 --> 4605.12
okay so they're gonna

4601.679 --> 4606.719
like train docking procedures

4605.12 --> 4609.719
basically

4606.719 --> 4609.719
okay

4611.12 --> 4613.5199999999995
woohoo

4615.28 --> 4619.0
fire up the simulators

4624.96 --> 4627.96
so

4636.56 --> 4641.120000000001
push it off its trajectories oh no but

4639.76 --> 4643.84
that's

4641.12 --> 4643.84
yeah whatever

4645.44 --> 4652.639999999999
i would say that's irresponsible because

4649.199 --> 4656.639999999999
what if it was used to actually maneuver

4652.64 --> 4658.96
a meteor right in earth's trajectory

4656.64 --> 4663.04
but yeah then i would kind of have to

4658.96 --> 4663.04
believe that any of that is real so

4679.679 --> 4683.6
it would be good if rockets worked in

4681.6 --> 4685.92
space yeah good point jeff gassett

4683.6 --> 4685.92
indeed

4688.48 --> 4691.639999999999
it's hilarious

4694.96 --> 4697.96
okay

4723.52 --> 4727.92
yeah gadgets but yeah i do that too

4725.44 --> 4727.919999999999
sometimes

4728.56 --> 4733.04
like i i particularly like like the rt

4731.6 --> 4736.8
section

4733.04 --> 4736.8
because they often have like

4736.88 --> 4743.28
space stories or something like oh look

4739.76 --> 4746.0
at this planet and all it's so special

4743.28 --> 4747.92
or like oh we figured out the black hole

4746.0 --> 4749.84
you know how that goes i i love those

4747.92 --> 4751.36
kind of silly stories and then

4749.84 --> 4752.96
especially looking in the comment

4751.36 --> 4754.639999999999
section to see like what are people

4752.96 --> 4757.28
responding with and there's like plenty

4754.64 --> 4758.8
of reactions where people actually do

4757.28 --> 4761.759999999999
just buy it

4758.8 --> 4763.76
but there's also like well flat earthers

4761.76 --> 4765.1990000000005
or just people that are highly skeptical

4763.76 --> 4769.6
of nasa that

4765.199 --> 4769.599999999999
just acting a bit trolly it's hilarious

4773.52 --> 4779.84
iss live feed man yeah yeah they don't

4776.96 --> 4782.64
appreciate no damn flat earthers

4779.84 --> 4785.4400000000005
disrupting the flock

4782.64 --> 4785.4400000000005
you know that

4787.679 --> 4791.679
yeah if you basically start making

4789.6 --> 4794.08
arguments as a flat earther you will be

4791.679 --> 4796.2390000000005
banned eventually

4794.08 --> 4796.239
so

4796.64 --> 4800.8
you know it's just a safe space for

4798.48 --> 4804.12
people that want to imagine it's real

4800.8 --> 4804.12
that's it

4811.44 --> 4814.759999999999
that is

4824.48 --> 4831.879999999999
talk about the most inconvenient mama

4828.88 --> 4831.88
aha

4844.4 --> 4849.36
how does that differ from effie channels

4846.48 --> 4849.36
banning clovers

4850.56 --> 4852.8
well

4853.76 --> 4858.1990000000005
i guess there isn't too much different

4860.88 --> 4863.12
right

4865.199 --> 4868.4
like we

4866.32 --> 4871.5199999999995
don't like people that are just trying

4868.4 --> 4874.96
to nag us or that ignore arguments and

4871.52 --> 4878.0
all that and now you know

4874.96 --> 4879.44
i know you know

4878.0 --> 4880.96
that you think

4879.44 --> 4882.96
that's what you're doing too because

4880.96 --> 4886.719
you're projecting

4882.96 --> 4889.12
the real world situation back on us

4886.719 --> 4891.199
saying like oh you're ignoring our

4889.12 --> 4894.5199999999995
arguments yeah you don't have any we

4891.199 --> 4898.0
actually respond to every single one

4894.52 --> 4900.719
enthusiastically vehemently every single

4898.0 --> 4903.76
time in detail like it's almost a newbie

4900.719 --> 4906.08
thing to be able to do that now

4903.76 --> 4908.08
you systematically spend a lot of time

4906.08 --> 4910.88
ignoring things

4908.08 --> 4913.44
but you like to think that we're the one

4910.88 --> 4914.2390000000005
ignoring your arguments i know you want

4913.44 --> 4917.04
that

4914.239 --> 4918.718999999999
it's just not true and we're not gonna

4917.04 --> 4922.159
buy it

4918.719 --> 4924.88
only you will buy it right because

4922.159 --> 4927.679
real global fanatic eventually ends up

4924.88 --> 4929.52
gaslighting themselves

4927.679 --> 4932.0
that's the primary target of the

4929.52 --> 4935.120000000001
influence is yourself

4932.0 --> 4937.36
to so that you can walk away the leaving

4935.12 --> 4940.92
you were on the right side

4937.36 --> 4940.92
that's what you do

4955.76 --> 4958.76
oh

4964.96 --> 4969.12
in the discord chat

4966.8 --> 4973.679
yeah but global mcglobe faced

4969.12 --> 4977.44
nobody in discord at 24 7 discord

4973.679 --> 4980.56
flat earth 24 7 discord actually reads

4977.44 --> 4980.5599999999995
the youtube chat

4983.84 --> 4987.04
nobody

4984.96 --> 4990.08
doesn't matter who you are like

4987.04 --> 4992.639
even when i speak up in that chat nobody

4990.08 --> 4995.44
sees it nobody actually looks at the

4992.639 --> 4998.4800000000005
youtube chat

4995.44 --> 5001.36
nobody on the actual discord panel looks

4998.48 --> 5004.32
at that

5001.36 --> 5006.0
so yeah they ignore questions but that

5004.32 --> 5007.759999999999
doesn't matter if you're a flat earther

5006.0 --> 5010.639
or global because they just don't take a

5007.76 --> 5010.639
look at that chat

5011.84 --> 5017.360000000001
there's more chance that you'll be

5013.84 --> 5018.8
perceived if you post it in their

5017.36 --> 5020.5599999999995
discord

5018.8 --> 5023.1990000000005
chat because there's a discord chat you

5020.56 --> 5025.4400000000005
can even chat put pictures in there

5023.199 --> 5026.96
if you do it there there's bigger chance

5025.44 --> 5029.599999999999
you're going to be picked up on by

5026.96 --> 5033.679
people in that discord

5029.6 --> 5035.76
of 24 7 discord flat earth 24 7 discord

5033.679 --> 5036.96
so

5035.76 --> 5039.04
yeah

5036.96 --> 5040.639
it's not because you're a glober it's

5039.04 --> 5044.56
just because nobody takes a look at the

5040.639 --> 5044.56
chat over there that's all

5045.76 --> 5050.400000000001
the discord youtube chat

5048.159 --> 5050.4
that

5051.36 --> 5053.599999999999
what

5054.08 --> 5059.44
no

5056.0 --> 5060.88
what discord that doesn't make sense

5059.44 --> 5064.638999999999
yeah

5060.88 --> 5067.76
the flat earth 24 7 youtube channel

5064.639 --> 5070.719
which uses discord yeah it can be very

5067.76 --> 5072.159000000001
active at times but nobody that actually

5070.719 --> 5074.32
speaks up

5072.159 --> 5076.5599999999995
from the discord

5074.32 --> 5077.759999999999
which are basically the panelists of

5076.56 --> 5081.1990000000005
that show

5077.76 --> 5085.2390000000005
actually looks at the youtube chat

5081.199 --> 5085.239
that's what i'm trying to say

5088.159 --> 5093.199
you can post pictures without rules oh

5090.56 --> 5094.080000000001
so you do know it uh well maybe they

5093.199 --> 5095.839999999999
just

5094.08 --> 5098.719
are ignoring you because you're an

5095.84 --> 5101.12
annoying gamma troll

5098.719 --> 5104.32
i don't even know why i've

5101.12 --> 5104.32
addressed you right now

5105.28 --> 5110.5199999999995
maybe because it's a bit of a silent

5107.52 --> 5110.52
moment

5119.28 --> 5123.599999999999
you're speaking about youtube that's why

5121.36 --> 5125.36
i said youtube yeah i know and that's

5123.6 --> 5127.52
why you're being ignored because nobody

5125.36 --> 5129.12
looks at that youtube chat

5127.52 --> 5131.280000000001
right

5129.12 --> 5133.5199999999995
which was the original premise of your

5131.28 --> 5136.159
statement like oh they're ignoring me

5133.52 --> 5137.84
yeah everybody ignores the chat no

5136.159 --> 5141.32
matter who's speaking up in there that

5137.84 --> 5141.32
was my rebuttal

5157.36 --> 5162.48
oh so

5158.96 --> 5165.12
people in the chat there that is being

5162.48 --> 5166.839999999999
ignored by the actual live show

5165.12 --> 5169.199
chant you

5166.84 --> 5170.719
say they do

5169.199 --> 5173.678999999999
no [ __ ]

5170.719 --> 5176.56
yeah it's a mess in there again because

5173.679 --> 5178.4
nobody's looking

5176.56 --> 5180.159000000001
right you can say whatever you want so

5178.4 --> 5182.638999999999
there is going to be

5180.159 --> 5184.0
a ballers but also flat earthers that

5182.639 --> 5186.400000000001
are just going to be

5184.0 --> 5188.159
global stupid globe is stupid because

5186.4 --> 5190.799999999999
they can't because nobody really checks

5188.159 --> 5193.5199999999995
out that yet so yeah some people find

5190.8 --> 5195.28
their places to get a little silly

5193.52 --> 5197.679
and of course they're going to ignore

5195.28 --> 5200.639
your globe arguments

5197.679 --> 5203.4400000000005
because that actually takes energy to

5200.639 --> 5206.2390000000005
address that again and all that

5203.44 --> 5211.678999999999
you know flat earthers aren't always in

5206.239 --> 5215.5599999999995
to go at globe arguments global

5211.679 --> 5215.56
yeah it's annoying

5240.199 --> 5246.48
extremist religious beliefs

5242.8 --> 5246.4800000000005
really what's extremist about it

5247.36 --> 5251.28
back to you oh hey hey

5249.44 --> 5253.36
one more mark out of you and you're i'm

5251.28 --> 5255.84
gonna kick you out

5253.36 --> 5258.32
but until then i i want to address uh

5255.84 --> 5260.400000000001
yeah the specific vernacular of your

5258.32 --> 5263.04
accusation

5260.4 --> 5266.879999999999
extremist religious belief so can you

5263.04 --> 5269.199
clarify on that please

5266.88 --> 5272.56
what is extremist about it

5269.199 --> 5272.5599999999995
what is religious about it

5277.04 --> 5282.639
yeah yeah i was such a safe space that

5279.12 --> 5285.28
i'm literally addressing your accusation

5282.639 --> 5288.159000000001
such a safe space right

5285.28 --> 5291.28
i mean that's just straight out banning

5288.159 --> 5294.0
actually addressing what somebody said

5291.28 --> 5297.04
that's the same as banning right

5294.0 --> 5300.0
actually bringing it up for discussion

5297.04 --> 5302.32
that's censorship

5300.0 --> 5302.32
huh

5302.8 --> 5305.8
lol

5316.48 --> 5319.919999999999
take the bible infallible

5321.199 --> 5324.638999999999
excuse me

5323.04 --> 5326.0
that's a lot of

5324.639 --> 5329.28
strawman

5326.0 --> 5329.28
assumptions there

5335.44 --> 5339.199
dude

5337.28 --> 5341.599999999999
are you actu

5339.199 --> 5343.919999999999
you better not be directly addressing me

5341.6 --> 5345.84
because i spent like half this show

5343.92 --> 5350.12
explaining

5345.84 --> 5350.12
the problem with the bible

5351.36 --> 5353.759999999999
this is

5360.0 --> 5364.239
yeah

5361.84 --> 5366.08
thousands of years extremist religious

5364.239 --> 5368.0
approach yeah and has nothing to do with

5366.08 --> 5369.44
christ though

5368.0 --> 5370.88
has to do with the

5369.44 --> 5373.759999999999
theology

5370.88 --> 5377.04
of priesthood power

5373.76 --> 5381.1990000000005
practices of mind control

5377.04 --> 5381.199
through acclaimed authority of god

5382.88 --> 5387.12
yeah

5384.8 --> 5389.92
and yeah if you actually look into the

5387.12 --> 5392.4
bible and the most core figure of it

5389.92 --> 5394.32
you'll find that he is vehemently

5392.4 --> 5395.599999999999
opposing

5394.32 --> 5398.639
all of that

5395.6 --> 5399.92
problem is though christ kind of died

5398.639 --> 5401.92
way back

5399.92 --> 5404.0
after which all this [ __ ] started

5401.92 --> 5407.52
rolling out

5404.0 --> 5410.0
trust me he's not happy about that he

5407.52 --> 5414.8
warned about that right

5410.0 --> 5414.8
so to blame all that [ __ ] on christ

5414.88 --> 5417.92
is kind of ridiculous because it's

5416.96 --> 5420.719
people

5417.92 --> 5424.4
abusing his legacy

5420.719 --> 5428.56
with power politics and mind control

5424.4 --> 5428.5599999999995
pretending to be the vicars of him

5429.28 --> 5432.88
that's actually causing the problem

5433.199 --> 5437.839999999999
theocracy

5434.88 --> 5437.84
priesthood power

5444.88 --> 5450.0
you don't care about oh so it's just

5447.12 --> 5452.8
extremist and you don't even

5450.0 --> 5456.0
want to actually respond to somebody who

5452.8 --> 5459.28
agrees with the problems do you

5456.0 --> 5462.4
so again total solipsism it's just throw

5459.28 --> 5464.8
it overboard i don't want to know

5462.4 --> 5466.5599999999995
even though the person you're i'm

5464.8 --> 5467.679
talking to you right now right this is

5466.56 --> 5469.120000000001
my show

5467.679 --> 5471.36
even though i

5469.12 --> 5474.48
basically recognize the issues and i'm

5471.36 --> 5476.48
trying to figure out

5474.48 --> 5478.08
how to

5476.48 --> 5479.759999999999
take care of this

5478.08 --> 5482.08
somehow

5479.76 --> 5484.8
all of us

5482.08 --> 5486.96
how do we fix this problem

5484.8 --> 5489.12
i'm actually addressing it you're just

5486.96 --> 5490.8
using it as an excuse to say we're

5489.12 --> 5491.92
extremists

5490.8 --> 5495.04
even though

5491.92 --> 5497.84
i've been addressing the problems from

5495.04 --> 5500.719
which extremism also come

5497.84 --> 5505.84
in detail psychology

5500.719 --> 5505.84
and all esoterics all of it

5518.88 --> 5522.96
yeah well i don't know who you're who

5520.639 --> 5525.679
you've been talking to but i don't know

5522.96 --> 5525.679
anybody that

5526.08 --> 5533.639
that acts like that except for a bunch

5528.719 --> 5533.639
of fanatics and they are very annoying

5535.6 --> 5538.8
and then there's other people that

5537.04 --> 5541.6
actually think it's a good thing to

5538.8 --> 5545.400000000001
defend the fanatics

5541.6 --> 5545.400000000001
that's even more annoying

5582.0 --> 5585.0
hmm

5594.48 --> 5597.599999999999
see

5595.199 --> 5598.48

5628.719 --> 5635.52
despite your kind of ridiculous claims

5863.679 --> 5866.679
hmm

5875.44 --> 5878.44
uh

5886.88 --> 5890.8
i thought i didn't believe that yeah no

5888.96 --> 5893.96
[ __ ]

5890.8 --> 5893.96
i don't

5896.08 --> 5902.5599999999995
although yeah i can't necessarily

5900.08 --> 5905.5199999999995
disprove it it just seems extremely

5902.56 --> 5905.52
counter-intuitive

5906.08 --> 5911.84
and illogical to me and i cannot accept

5909.84 --> 5913.84
a logic to be a logic that's the

5911.84 --> 5916.32
beginning of the end

5913.84 --> 5916.32
that's all

5919.92 --> 5924.88
so i don't believe the web no no that's

5922.88 --> 5925.76
not a logical conclusion that i would

5924.88 --> 5928.159000000001
draw

5925.76 --> 5928.159000000001
at all

5929.199 --> 5931.36
no

5932.48 --> 5939.04
i believe the words in there

5936.08 --> 5942.0
to be figured out

5939.04 --> 5944.239
i'm not like like i'm not in under the

5942.0 --> 5946.32
assumption that you can open any kind of

5944.239 --> 5949.119
book including the bible

5946.32 --> 5952.88
be a blank slate and then get absolute

5949.119 --> 5955.119
100 truth out of it no no you can't

5952.88 --> 5958.88
there is no no such book in the world

5955.119 --> 5958.88
ever nor will there ever be

5959.92 --> 5966.04
because

5961.6 --> 5966.04
your spirit doesn't work like that

5966.719 --> 5972.2390000000005
right you can read the same book

5969.28 --> 5975.36
a hundred times and every time

5972.239 --> 5975.36
read it differently

5975.44 --> 5980.36
draw different conclusions from it

5982.8 --> 5986.96
that doesn't make me not believe in the

5985.28 --> 5989.199
bible it just

5986.96 --> 5991.52
i'm not going to go with this ridiculous

5989.199 --> 5992.32
notion

5991.52 --> 5995.76
like

5992.32 --> 5998.639
it's impossible to misinterpret it or to

5995.76 --> 5998.639
make a mistake

6000.159 --> 6005.119
or that the consensus is always right

6003.28 --> 6007.759999999999
like because of christianity has

6005.119 --> 6010.4
concluded this is how we see it yeah

6007.76 --> 6010.400000000001
[ __ ] you

6012.159 --> 6015.36
i don't care

6013.6 --> 6017.92
i mean if it is

6015.36 --> 6020.639
logical in ways then i'll go with that

6017.92 --> 6021.76
but i'm not just gonna like

6020.639 --> 6023.8
limit

6021.76 --> 6026.400000000001
my own

6023.8 --> 6028.719
exploratory dynamics

6026.4 --> 6032.44
when it comes to these things i'm not

6028.719 --> 6032.44
going to do that ever

6036.8 --> 6042.88
like that is real freedom

6038.88 --> 6044.88
freedom not to let yourself be limited

6042.88 --> 6047.28
just because you might risk

6044.88 --> 6048.32
opponents people turning against you

6047.28 --> 6050.639
yeah yeah

6048.32 --> 6052.719
there's a person

6050.639 --> 6055.719
who made mention about that name was

6052.719 --> 6055.719
jesus

6072.719 --> 6075.679
translation of the bible might be wrong

6074.8 --> 6077.52
no

6075.679 --> 6080.0
well yeah and no

6077.52 --> 6083.040000000001
it's all subject to political

6080.0 --> 6085.52
alterations and even the very creation

6083.04 --> 6088.4
of the language has

6085.52 --> 6090.96
entanglements like that like literally

6088.4 --> 6092.96
this the root language is that we

6090.96 --> 6094.08
literally

6092.96 --> 6096.56
use

6094.08 --> 6099.6
have been used to politically maneuver

6096.56 --> 6103.1990000000005
situations like how it was created has

6099.6 --> 6105.1990000000005
been politically contaminated in ways

6103.199 --> 6106.48
it's complicated it's so freaking

6105.199 --> 6108.638999999999
complicated

6106.48 --> 6108.638999999999
but

6109.92 --> 6114.159
no i'm not saying it is wrong i'm saying

6111.92 --> 6118.52
the way the people interpret the bible

6114.159 --> 6118.5199999999995
is wrong that's what i'm saying

6157.92 --> 6161.36
all right anyway

6159.679 --> 6165.56
i'll be back in two minutes and i think

6161.36 --> 6165.5599999999995
i'm gonna round out the shot in

6239.84 --> 6242.84
so

6251.36 --> 6254.759999999999
and back

6269.199 --> 6275.799999999999
yes logical conclusion

6271.28 --> 6275.8
yeah you're right that's why i

6276.0 --> 6280.88
well that's why i allow some trolls to

6278.239 --> 6280.879999999999
do their thing

6286.88 --> 6290.8
yeah because if it is getting quiet and

6289.04 --> 6292.32
everybody's just kind of like sitting in

6290.8 --> 6296.28
the background yeah that doesn't make a

6292.32 --> 6296.28
super interesting show

6302.32 --> 6307.36
don't you also yeah pretty much all of

6304.8 --> 6307.360000000001
that yeah

6307.44 --> 6311.28
i think all of that is quite ridiculous

6312.56 --> 6317.4400000000005
like seriously if you just

6314.88 --> 6319.76
read that in a row

6317.44 --> 6322.638999999999
then you know the guys that came up with

6319.76 --> 6325.04
that were probably

6322.639 --> 6327.6
like priest figures that were isolated

6325.04 --> 6329.92
for a long time

6327.6 --> 6333.1990000000005
got high on mushrooms and then thought

6329.92 --> 6335.679
that that makes sense

6333.199 --> 6337.919999999999
right the trinity

6335.679 --> 6339.76
the authority of the apostles the

6337.92 --> 6341.92
resurrection

6339.76 --> 6345.400000000001
immaculate conception and the virgin

6341.92 --> 6345.4
birth yeah

6345.92 --> 6348.719
you would have to be on mushrooms to

6347.679 --> 6350.88
actually

6348.719 --> 6352.4
believe that any of that makes sense in

6350.88 --> 6355.6
the face

6352.4 --> 6359.839999999999
like what authority

6355.6 --> 6359.84
of the apostles it's jesus

6362.4 --> 6368.0
god has the authority like

6364.719 --> 6370.4800000000005
there is no designation of of

6368.0 --> 6373.199
of authority

6370.48 --> 6376.638999999999
everybody has their own authority

6373.199 --> 6376.638999999999
how well do you connect

6378.32 --> 6383.679
like you don't you don't just get

6380.32 --> 6385.92
appointed a role and get authority

6383.679 --> 6388.639
according to jesus's teachings that's

6385.92 --> 6390.639
not how it works

6388.639 --> 6393.8
it's about a conscious decision taking

6390.639 --> 6393.8
the responsibility

6394.639 --> 6400.08
and then just managing

6397.52 --> 6402.320000000001
people around you for the better it's

6400.08 --> 6405.28
not an authority that just comes by

6402.32 --> 6405.28
being appointed

6406.32 --> 6409.36
because of the title

6410.48 --> 6416.48
right and the resurrection yeah

6413.76 --> 6418.4800000000005
i like to believe it

6416.48 --> 6421.199
i'm just

6418.48 --> 6422.239
i think in yeah in the face of the

6421.199 --> 6424.4
wisdom

6422.239 --> 6426.5599999999995
of his words i think that really the

6424.4 --> 6429.119
resurrection is kind of insignificant i

6426.56 --> 6430.4800000000005
know it's like really like wow

6429.119 --> 6432.96
you know

6430.48 --> 6435.04
but the words and their power their

6432.96 --> 6437.679
echoing through the ages and their

6435.04 --> 6440.159
influence to me are much more powerful

6437.679 --> 6440.159
than that

6441.76 --> 6445.4400000000005
right an immaculate conception and

6443.6 --> 6448.0
virgin birth yeah that kind of like

6445.44 --> 6449.5199999999995
sounds like just

6448.0 --> 6451.76
i don't know

6449.52 --> 6453.360000000001
in this age i kind of associate that

6451.76 --> 6457.84
sort of thing

6453.36 --> 6457.839999999999
with like uh artificial insemination

6458.32 --> 6463.36
right

6459.679 --> 6463.36
it kind of reminds me of the whole

6463.76 --> 6468.159000000001
greek mythos

6465.92 --> 6469.52
with the zeus

6468.159 --> 6472.08
like

6469.52 --> 6474.8
yeah cons conceiving

6472.08 --> 6477.119
with humans with the human women and all

6474.8 --> 6480.159000000001
that right that's what it reminds me

6477.119 --> 6483.159
it's just like what

6480.159 --> 6483.159
like

6486.8 --> 6490.400000000001
yeah high end mushrooms and i'll bet you

6488.8 --> 6492.320000000001
that the

6490.4 --> 6495.04
the priesthood the christian priesthood

6492.32 --> 6497.119
in the roman era when with all the close

6495.04 --> 6500.08
church you'll bet your ass they were

6497.119 --> 6503.28
like doing

6500.08 --> 6505.199
like rituals not necessarily super dark

6503.28 --> 6507.84
but like they were

6505.199 --> 6509.599999999999
making mushroom stews and getting high

6507.84 --> 6512.2390000000005
off their asses

6509.6 --> 6513.04
and like experimenting with oils and all

6512.239 --> 6515.28
that

6513.04 --> 6518.32
so yeah i'll bet your ass they were high

6515.28 --> 6518.32
as [ __ ] a lot of them

6524.4 --> 6529.04
like the ones that did the secret

6526.4 --> 6530.48
studies inside that nobody would ever

6529.04 --> 6532.88
get to see

6530.48 --> 6534.48
like the internal priesthood and then

6532.88 --> 6537.119
there's the external priesthood that

6534.48 --> 6539.04
deals with the people and that

6537.119 --> 6540.799999999999
tells them what to believe and then

6539.04 --> 6543.119
there's the internal priesthood that

6540.8 --> 6547.28
does like the inner research

6543.119 --> 6550.48
get high as [ __ ] on mushrooms and like

6547.28 --> 6552.88
like make incredible drawings and yes

6550.48 --> 6554.959999999999
[Laughter]

6552.88 --> 6558.719
wine i don't know if they're all of them

6554.96 --> 6559.84
were like drunk 24 7.

6558.719 --> 6563.36
but

6559.84 --> 6563.360000000001
some of them probably were

6564.48 --> 6569.839999999999
but i have a high suspicion that there

6566.239 --> 6569.839999999999
were mushrooms involved

6589.119 --> 6593.44
jesus also sent out 72 disciples to

6591.92 --> 6596.56
teach

6593.44 --> 6599.598999999999
no it's not basically priests

6596.56 --> 6602.400000000001
to teach just to teach his teachings is

6599.599 --> 6602.400000000001
not a priest

6602.719 --> 6608.719
what i distinctly call a priesthood

6605.44 --> 6610.799999999999
is where the priests conspire to be the

6608.719 --> 6613.44
keepers of the knowledge

6610.8 --> 6616.0
and to basically tell the people

6613.44 --> 6618.799999999999
to be the arbiter to be the sole

6616.0 --> 6620.639
communicator within that knowledge to be

6618.8 --> 6622.639
the keeper of that knowledge that's when

6620.639 --> 6625.28
it really becomes a priesthood if you're

6622.639 --> 6627.52
just teachings

6625.28 --> 6629.92
teaching great teachings that's

6627.52 --> 6629.92
different

6630.96 --> 6636.8
right it's not an organization

6634.56 --> 6639.92
it's not like oh you have to teach it

6636.8 --> 6642.320000000001
this way let's unify the program we're

6639.92 --> 6644.2390000000005
going to roll out no no every apostle

6642.32 --> 6645.5199999999995
did it in their own way

6644.239 --> 6647.04
separated

6645.52 --> 6650.2390000000005
decentralized

6647.04 --> 6652.32
their interpretations

6650.239 --> 6654.5599999999995
right and then eventually like sort of

6652.32 --> 6656.639
politics games did leak in because yeah

6654.56 --> 6658.320000000001
a lot of people are believing and

6656.639 --> 6660.8
so much development and this so they

6658.32 --> 6661.759999999999
kind of agree like let's not do that

6660.8 --> 6662.639
part

6661.76 --> 6664.8
like

6662.639 --> 6664.8
and

6665.679 --> 6672.28
it's religious it's just religions

6669.28 --> 6672.28
right

6684.96 --> 6688.719
sounds like cherry-picking

6686.719 --> 6691.599
neo-christianity

6688.719 --> 6694.719
is new ageism

6691.599 --> 6697.599
what is old christianity then just

6694.719 --> 6699.92
chanting your ass off and just be part

6697.599 --> 6702.56
of that

6699.92 --> 6706.119
the system

6702.56 --> 6706.119000000001
i don't get it

6722.56 --> 6726.96
they were told to drink

6726.0 --> 6728.239
wine

6726.96 --> 6730.4
well

6728.239 --> 6730.4
i

6730.719 --> 6733.76
maybe get

6732.32 --> 6736.4
like there's a suspicion like in

6733.76 --> 6738.639
medieval time that

6736.4 --> 6740.32
when like the conditions were terrible

6738.639 --> 6743.92
and there were no

6740.32 --> 6746.4
no more functioning sewer systems

6743.92 --> 6749.679
that they eventually

6746.4 --> 6751.36
in a lot of places decided to just make

6749.679 --> 6753.4400000000005
cheap beer

6751.36 --> 6756.239
available for drinking

6753.44 --> 6760.239
because a lot of the water and

6756.239 --> 6760.239
wells were contaminated

6760.8 --> 6765.119000000001
so that makes sense

6763.04 --> 6766.639
yeah wine from grapes

6765.119 --> 6770.159
and beer

6766.639 --> 6773.36
because it would be less less chance of

6770.159 --> 6774.159
having yeah infectious stuff in there

6773.36 --> 6777.159
like

6774.159 --> 6777.159
poison

6782.88 --> 6788.88
the romans cleaned it up for their

6785.199 --> 6791.678999999999
aqueducts you know viaducts right

6788.88 --> 6793.84
so yeah there is a big chance that like

6791.679 --> 6795.84
alcohol was kind of like the common

6793.84 --> 6800.4800000000005
drink

6795.84 --> 6800.4800000000005
in certain places in europe especially

6803.76 --> 6808.08
when there was a lot of unhealthy

6806.0 --> 6811.599
conditions

6808.08 --> 6813.5199999999995
because it just was safer

6811.599 --> 6816.2390000000005
or at least yeah

6813.52 --> 6818.96
that's what i've been taught

6816.239 --> 6821.199
historically about it

6818.96 --> 6823.04
but yeah i was talking more specifically

6821.199 --> 6823.839999999999
about like

6823.04 --> 6826.4
like

6823.84 --> 6826.400000000001
priests

6826.48 --> 6832.959999999999
and their research

6828.88 --> 6832.96
the priests were not just drunks

6833.84 --> 6838.719
maybe political priests right the ones

6836.32 --> 6840.719
that are like emissaries for like the

6838.719 --> 6842.88
pope and all maybe some of those were

6840.719 --> 6845.599
like just drunk

6842.88 --> 6847.04
like drunk diplomat types sure that

6845.599 --> 6850.32
those would have been there but not like

6847.04 --> 6853.599
the the studying the scribes no no

6850.32 --> 6856.32
no they were not drunks

6853.599 --> 6858.4800000000005
like have you ever tried to write

6856.32 --> 6861.48
by hand while being drunk good luck with

6858.48 --> 6861.48
that

6863.599 --> 6866.0
anyway

6866.32 --> 6872.28
i think i'm gonna round out the show

6867.599 --> 6872.28
it's been an interesting show

6880.719 --> 6884.0
i want to dumb down society give them

6882.56 --> 6885.280000000001
alcohol

6884.0 --> 6887.44
yes

6885.28 --> 6887.44
but

6888.159 --> 6893.119
alcohol it can also well it's also kind

6890.56 --> 6895.360000000001
of sterilizing

6893.119 --> 6895.36
so

6901.84 --> 6906.639
i don't know that

6903.28 --> 6906.639
yeah i'm gonna run out to show

6907.52 --> 6912.719
right water would give you this entry

6910.48 --> 6915.5199999999995
so the best to drink the weak beer yeah

6912.719 --> 6918.639
exactly exactly dave though that was the

6915.52 --> 6921.52
point that i was trying to make right

6918.639 --> 6923.599
anyway thanks everyone for coming i hope
