114.64 --> 120.56
trouble

116.719 --> 123.52
right so yeah the weather today

120.56 --> 123.52
has cooled down

124.88 --> 128.64
like just pretty much 15 minutes ago

128.239 --> 132.0
like

128.64 --> 137.11999999999998
this bro yeah the storm broke out

132.0 --> 137.12
so there's this still raining

140.64 --> 145.66
and yeah freshen up too you know ends me

143.84 --> 150.969
wearing the shirt

145.66 --> 150.969
[Music]

151.36 --> 157.84
right so today yeah i got

154.48 --> 157.84
mint tea with me

158.319 --> 160.95899999999997
and that's it

162.0 --> 165.519
because i don't know i'm gonna try to

163.68 --> 168.4
avoid

165.519 --> 168.4
regular tea

168.56 --> 175.44
for a bit had coffee didn't really

172.0 --> 177.84
uh land too well so yeah i got

175.44 --> 179.2
my back problems from yesterday have

177.84 --> 183.28
sort of like uh

179.2 --> 185.11999999999998
i hope peaked and i also figured out

183.28 --> 187.04
things that i can do to kind of lessen

185.12 --> 189.519
it and it seems like i'm not the only

187.04 --> 192.56
one there's been other people

189.519 --> 194.48000000000002
apparently have this too so it's

192.56 --> 196.64000000000001
it's probably due to the weather

194.48 --> 199.84
transition and all that

196.64 --> 202.72
hey good servant glad you found the chat

199.84 --> 202.72
martin tolberg

210.84 --> 213.84
right

214.879 --> 218.39999999999998
so yeah i got some lower back issues i

217.84 --> 222.159
hope

218.4 --> 222.159
there yeah today is going to be

222.4 --> 227.68
it's going to go yeah well it is doing

224.08 --> 231.36
better already you know it is like

227.68 --> 233.84
in the evening like this night i have

231.36 --> 235.43900000000002
i've had less trouble with it than i had

233.84 --> 237.92000000000002
last night so

235.439 --> 238.64
i think it's just going to go a little

237.92 --> 240.39999999999998
better

238.64 --> 242.0
it's already starting to flex up a

240.4 --> 244.0
little so

242.0 --> 246.0
because it is really i don't know if i'd

244.0 --> 246.959
have to like describe what it's like

246.0 --> 249.92
it's like these

246.959 --> 251.519
certain type of muscles it's always the

249.92 --> 254.07999999999998
same thing you know this had this does

251.519 --> 256.639
kind of happen on a yearly basis

254.08 --> 258.32
depending on the weather conditions

256.639 --> 262.479
typically

258.32 --> 264.32
during during autumn

262.479 --> 265.919
and like these muscles i don't know in

264.32 --> 268.15999999999997
the lower back

265.919 --> 269.52
started out like above right it's like

268.16 --> 271.12
the shoulder muscle thing

269.52 --> 273.75899999999996
it starts to cramp and then when it

271.12 --> 275.919
cramps it has trouble like letting go

273.759 --> 277.44
so because it's stiff and it shortens

275.919 --> 279.28
like

277.44 --> 281.28
yeah it pulls on everything and that's

279.28 --> 282.96
really annoying that went away i got rid

281.28 --> 284.23999999999995
of that pretty quickly i know how to do

282.96 --> 286.32
that

284.24 --> 287.28000000000003
by massaging it myself and very

286.32 --> 289.36
carefully because

287.28 --> 290.63899999999995
if that goes wrong then i'm [ __ ] and

289.36 --> 292.40000000000003
it's really like i

290.639 --> 295.04
feel like a freaking hunchback all day

292.4 --> 298.4
long well thank god that didn't happen

295.04 --> 301.759
but instead it migrated to my lower back

298.4 --> 305.84
yeah and that it just

301.759 --> 308.72
tends to yeah turn me into like a

305.84 --> 309.11999999999995
wooden board that's how it feels like

308.72 --> 311.28000000000003
i'm

309.12 --> 312.88
yeah my back it just makes it makes it

311.28 --> 314.23999999999995
feel like it's a wooden board it's very

312.88 --> 317.28
stiff-ish

314.24 --> 320.32
not so much like a hunchback

317.28 --> 320.79999999999995
and it always goes away but it's like

320.32 --> 324.4
these

320.8 --> 327.12
couple of muscles are just

324.4 --> 329.52
i can't even pinpoint like where exactly

327.12 --> 331.759
it is

329.52 --> 333.44
in the lower back like if it's like on

331.759 --> 337.44
the hips

333.44 --> 341.199
or like somewhere else but yeah

337.44 --> 341.199
exercising and stretching yeah

342.08 --> 347.52
well i do keep it flexible pretty much

345.44 --> 350.56
throughout the year i do that naturally

347.52 --> 356.0
it's just i built

350.56 --> 359.28000000000003
that into my standard routines

356.0 --> 362.24
and uh yeah once it just gets cramped

359.28 --> 364.15999999999997
it just doesn't stretch up again like

362.24 --> 368.24
for a while

364.16 --> 369.84000000000003
it's like stuck and it like needs to

368.24 --> 371.52
i guess whatever is causing the

369.84 --> 374.56
stiffness it's probably

371.52 --> 377.35999999999996
clutters of some kind and it just

374.56 --> 379.28000000000003
yeah needs a lot of time to bleed

377.36 --> 382.72
through to get it all out again

379.28 --> 384.15999999999997
to and stiffen it that's what i've

382.72 --> 387.36
learned how that works for

384.16 --> 389.12
roughly and there's all kinds of

387.36 --> 389.84000000000003
exercise i do yeah this is not very

389.12 --> 391.68
exciting

389.84 --> 393.11999999999995
our wins back problems but anyway a

391.68 --> 396.88
little trick

393.12 --> 399.039
that i figured out for this and i don't

396.88 --> 400.0
remember having discovered that before

399.039 --> 403.199
is it sounds

400.0 --> 404.4
weird it's super basic it's basically

403.199 --> 407.36
like

404.4 --> 409.19899999999996
almost like marching practice put up

407.36 --> 411.52000000000004
your knees like this

409.199 --> 412.639
i don't know if you can hear this i can

411.52 --> 414.79999999999995
hear it like

412.639 --> 416.72
through the resonating of my back but

414.8 --> 419.759
like doing this

416.72 --> 423.03900000000004
seems to rub

419.759 --> 425.199
the stiff muscles from the inside

423.039 --> 426.24
towards the back i can hear it plot

425.199 --> 429.12
every time

426.24 --> 430.319
i put my knee back down well that for

429.12 --> 432.88
some reason does

430.319 --> 434.47900000000004
loosen it up a little at least temporary

432.88 --> 434.88
it literally if i do this a couple of

434.479 --> 438.08
times

434.88 --> 440.08
eventually my back will start to feel

438.08 --> 441.199
more straight now it doesn't last very

440.08 --> 443.199
long

441.199 --> 445.36
but it's a temporary exercise yeah it

443.199 --> 451.52000000000004
looks silly

445.36 --> 456.16
but it works it's very simple

451.52 --> 456.15999999999997
for the lower back issue right so

458.0 --> 464.4
right yippee i don't know maybe

461.68 --> 466.24
there's others out there confirmed with

464.4 --> 470.31899999999996
one at least that also has

466.24 --> 479.12
currently back problems so

470.319 --> 481.44
who knows a tip like this might help

479.12 --> 481.44
uh

483.919 --> 488.79999999999995
weird youtube visit saturday able to be

487.199 --> 492.8
here now

488.8 --> 495.199
yeah martin telberk it is saturday

492.8 --> 495.91900000000004
there's no flat earth debates live so

495.199 --> 500.0
i'm just

495.919 --> 500.0
doing a standard one half hour show i

504.84 --> 509.75899999999996
think

506.639 --> 513.039
uh yeah pjp files

509.759 --> 516.159
doing fine except for the back

513.039 --> 516.159
but i'll get over it

517.68 --> 522.399
i got a flat tire okay that's annoying

525.04 --> 529.92
ah notes notes didn't make any notes

527.519 --> 535.839
barely

529.92 --> 535.8389999999999
but i don't know

538.72 --> 542.72
right there was no yeah there was

540.48 --> 549.6800000000001
flutter of the bait life

542.72 --> 552.1600000000001
and it was extra rumpussy i know rumpus

549.68 --> 553.279
cut yeah i think it was was it in the

552.16 --> 556.3199999999999
after show

553.279 --> 557.279
rumpus usually does come on to the after

556.32 --> 560.5600000000001
show it's

557.279 --> 562.08
like typically what he does rarely comes

560.56 --> 565.4399999999999
on to like the live

562.08 --> 569.519
actual literal live show

565.44 --> 574.0
but man like he he was on a romper's

569.519 --> 574.0
yeah i'm in a very rumpusy mood and

574.64 --> 578.0
it was kind of funny to be part of that

577.279 --> 581.4399999999999
panel

578.0 --> 583.6
and just see that happen like how many

581.44 --> 583.9200000000001
times has this happened to rumpus and it

583.6 --> 588.9590000000001
just

583.92 --> 588.959
keeps repeating itself the whole process

589.12 --> 594.48
i don't know uh

592.24 --> 597.44
right no owen benjamin life he did

594.48 --> 597.44
another replay

598.0 --> 609.44
glad i remember

605.36 --> 609.44
make a note for further reference

611.36 --> 616.5600000000001
uh yeah i didn't really hung around hang

615.04 --> 619.8389999999999
around to watch that but

616.56 --> 619.8389999999999
oh well

627.44 --> 633.12
uh no pjp files

630.959 --> 634.64
okay if you wanted to come around look

633.12 --> 636.8
that's fine

634.64 --> 638.72
you can contact me i'm open for that

636.8 --> 642.959
sort of thing depending on

638.72 --> 642.9590000000001
yeah what you what you want

644.079 --> 661.12
but no this is not my front there this

646.0 --> 663.44
is my balcony door

661.12 --> 664.48
so unless you're part of the roof

663.44 --> 666.5600000000001
maintenance

664.48 --> 674.0
crew or something that's that's simply

666.56 --> 677.3599999999999
never gonna happen

674.0 --> 679.6
all right mori be gleno never heard of

677.36 --> 679.6
that

681.44 --> 689.36
many people are buying every story yep

686.0 --> 693.12
yeah you know it's almost like a

689.36 --> 695.839
naivety economy there's people out there

693.12 --> 696.64
so much is being taken there and despite

695.839 --> 699.6800000000001
that they're so

696.64 --> 703.1999999999999
unwilling to learn from the process to

699.68 --> 706.3199999999999
wake up of what's actually transpiring

703.2 --> 710.5600000000001
that they are getting themselves lost

706.32 --> 713.12
in anything like as long

710.56 --> 714.56
as they don't have the sense that they

713.12 --> 716.9590000000001
have to realize

714.56 --> 718.4799999999999
so much is fake they'll just buy

716.959 --> 719.1999999999999
anything and they won't think about it

718.48 --> 722.8000000000001
and as soon as

719.2 --> 724.8000000000001
to them it becomes apparent like oh

722.8 --> 727.3599999999999
there is some reason i shouldn't trust

724.8 --> 729.4399999999999
it anymore they'll just forget about it

727.36 --> 730.72
they won't remember it and then like

729.44 --> 733.44
categorize it and

730.72 --> 734.639
oh this is something that's could be

733.44 --> 737.6
considered mr no

734.639 --> 738.48
they often just forget because

737.6 --> 744.32
forgetting is

738.48 --> 746.16
like a big part of the naivety economy

744.32 --> 748.72
because if you remember everything then

746.16 --> 750.639
eventually you must wake up now this is

748.72 --> 752.32
very similar to how the ballers go

750.639 --> 754.399
around in their interactions with the

752.32 --> 756.72
flat earthers

754.399 --> 757.68
they must forget because they can't

756.72 --> 760.9590000000001
remember it

757.68 --> 762.4799999999999
if it sticks then yeah what stick starts

760.959 --> 764.4799999999999
to build and eventually

762.48 --> 765.76
an image of insight will appear

764.48 --> 769.44
dispelling

765.76 --> 769.4399999999999
what they're trying to assert all of the

770.839 --> 774.5600000000001
time

772.16 --> 774.56
anyway

775.279 --> 787.8389999999999
but i don't know who that is martin

777.2 --> 787.839
tolberg i have no idea

798.839 --> 803.519
um

800.079 --> 815.8389999999999
it's youtube uh i don't think that will

803.519 --> 815.839
work out either

826.839 --> 831.9200000000001
weird

828.399 --> 831.92
yeah i got some weird

836.48 --> 840.639
yeah closed wound how do you call that

838.399 --> 843.92
very little but it was from ice

840.639 --> 846.16
you know trying to get ice out of the

843.92 --> 847.519
out of the freezer and like the ice was

846.16 --> 850.88
piled up and

847.519 --> 853.41
yeah if you get very rough

850.88 --> 855.279
and you rub your hand my

853.41 --> 859.8389999999999
[Music]

855.279 --> 864.24
my knuckles right past like

859.839 --> 864.24
frost crystal yeah it's pretty sharp so

867.68 --> 872.4799999999999
you don't expect that it's like it's

869.839 --> 872.48
just water

872.56 --> 876.959
but yeah it can be pretty damn hard

874.639 --> 876.9590000000001
anyway

881.519 --> 885.839
hey youtube

887.04 --> 899.8389999999999
so what shall i talk about today

911.12 --> 915.279
all right oh yeah i remember yeah i've

913.04 --> 918.24
been watching a lot of

915.279 --> 920.079
music youtube videos and stuff just

918.24 --> 922.48
going around some of the channels that

920.079 --> 926.2399999999999
i'm subscribed to are purely

922.48 --> 929.36
music makers like guitar

926.24 --> 932.0790000000001
and well davey 504 bass

929.36 --> 932.72
and yeah so it just went looking around

932.079 --> 941.8389999999999
that

932.72 --> 941.839
i don't know

949.199 --> 955.8389999999999
slap yeah

959.519 --> 965.44
what youtube it was talked about around

962.759 --> 970.24
2005

965.44 --> 970.24
grays or international banking

973.44 --> 976.5600000000001
look it still gets talked about the

975.6 --> 980.48
issue is it

976.56 --> 983.8389999999999
so much has already just been researched

980.48 --> 983.839
through and through

990.639 --> 994.88
i think that the general public is kind

993.6 --> 997.1990000000001
of aware that

994.88 --> 998.32
yeah there is banking conspiracy going

997.199 --> 1002.079
on

998.32 --> 1005.1990000000001
especially now with this new situation

1002.079 --> 1006.7199999999999
oh yeah by the way something might be

1005.199 --> 1010.56
noteworthy

1006.72 --> 1014.5600000000001
apparently i'm getting articles

1010.56 --> 1014.56
shoved in my face now concerning

1015.04 --> 1017.36
is it

1018.959 --> 1028.319
belarus or as it's called

1023.199 --> 1028.319
in dutch apparently white russia like

1028.88 --> 1034.5590000000002
that they are the president there

1031.919 --> 1036.16
i think it's a pretty uh pretty based

1034.559 --> 1039.6
guy

1036.16 --> 1041.919
like he was offered to to get 940

1039.6 --> 1045.4389999999999
million euros apparently

1041.919 --> 1047.679
or dollars from the world bank

1045.439 --> 1050.16
if they would go with the kovit

1047.679 --> 1053.44
procedures and go into lockdown and he

1050.16 --> 1057.6000000000001
refused that and he's been basically

1053.44 --> 1060.64
reported openly on onto it

1057.6 --> 1060.6399999999999
and now yeah

1060.72 --> 1064.16
it's leaking through the media he's now

1062.799 --> 1068.0
the the latest

1064.16 --> 1070.88
oh now he is evil you know it's so basic

1068.0 --> 1073.039
how politics works these days they just

1070.88 --> 1075.5200000000002
somebody doesn't work along with their

1073.039 --> 1078.08
stupid schemes

1075.52 --> 1079.12
then yeah the media just the corrupt

1078.08 --> 1081.36
media

1079.12 --> 1083.039
new world order media starts to point at

1081.36 --> 1086.1599999999999
those individuals just say oh they're

1083.039 --> 1086.16
hitler they're evil

1088.32 --> 1091.6789999999999
but i'm glad that there's just multiple

1090.559 --> 1094.0
people

1091.679 --> 1096.0800000000002
or multiple countries presidents however

1094.0 --> 1099.28
you want to see it around the world are

1096.08 --> 1099.28
are doing that at least

1102.0 --> 1109.84
so i'm not super informed about it this

1104.559 --> 1109.84
kind of just came around the corner

1124.08 --> 1141.039
oh what

1136.48 --> 1143.52
elohim is a mortal gene engineer

1141.039 --> 1143.52
okay

1147.039 --> 1151.84
this is right

1162.0 --> 1167.039
yeah right yeah martin's martin talbot

1163.76 --> 1170.72
look vatican [ __ ]

1167.039 --> 1174.32
they are the satanists they yeah

1170.72 --> 1177.2
who's been championing the whole atheist

1174.32 --> 1179.52
modeling who came up with the big bang

1177.2 --> 1179.52
you know

1181.6 --> 1189.6789999999999
who who had control over

1185.6 --> 1192.0
astronomy so them

1189.679 --> 1194.64
they're the ones doing it so yeah them

1192.0 --> 1195.36
coming out oh yeah we i'm a researcher

1194.64 --> 1197.2
oh

1195.36 --> 1199.6789999999999
oh yeah we came out that god actually

1197.2 --> 1201.919
doesn't exist oh and then all the

1199.679 --> 1203.919
all the atheists are all rejoicing oh

1201.919 --> 1206.88
see i'll finally

1203.919 --> 1209.44
the main church in their minds is coming

1206.88 --> 1212.0
over to our side of reason

1209.44 --> 1212.96
oh so they're all thank you so much and

1212.0 --> 1215.679
they want to

1212.96 --> 1217.919
radiate that off that that finally all

1215.679 --> 1219.2800000000002
the christians all of them of out there

1217.919 --> 1221.6000000000001
will realize that

1219.28 --> 1222.3999999999999
it's just about control there is no real

1221.6 --> 1226.08
god

1222.4 --> 1228.48
so it's literally just atheist

1226.08 --> 1230.1589999999999
virtue signaling in that chat i bet

1228.48 --> 1232.88
martin tolberg

1230.159 --> 1232.88
this is all

1233.28 --> 1238.8799999999999
yeah anti-god media operations

1236.4 --> 1241.039
there's a there there are those and

1238.88 --> 1243.6000000000001
people do this voluntarily they're just

1241.039 --> 1247.12
driven by the spirit

1243.6 --> 1250.48
that the spirit that just doesn't

1247.12 --> 1252.6399999999999
want a creator or a god or a overarching

1250.48 --> 1255.6
entity to exist

1252.64 --> 1255.6000000000001
they cannot

1256.0 --> 1262.32
allow there to be competition

1259.039 --> 1265.6
for godhood for their own ego they

1262.32 --> 1268.48
have to feel like they can be

1265.6 --> 1270.48
literal gods their ego demands it of

1268.48 --> 1272.48
them it's very addictive once you get

1270.48 --> 1277.84
that idea in your head

1272.48 --> 1277.84
it's a big part of it you know

1278.32 --> 1280.96
but yeah

1282.24 --> 1286.72
it's a lie it's a lie that kind of cuts

1285.28 --> 1290.3999999999999
you off from god

1286.72 --> 1292.72
makes it easier for yourself to imagine

1290.4 --> 1296.48
that you can do just whatever and that

1292.72 --> 1299.52
you can keep secrets and that it won't

1296.48 --> 1301.679
have any consequences other than social

1299.52 --> 1305.12
responses

1301.679 --> 1307.44
you know there's no spiritual effects

1305.12 --> 1309.84
going on there's no

1307.44 --> 1312.24
outside of the material realm influences

1309.84 --> 1315.1999999999998
that it may have

1312.24 --> 1315.84
what you do and how how you conduct

1315.2 --> 1318.72
yourself

1315.84 --> 1321.039
how you how you act in this world than

1318.72 --> 1324.32
your body

1321.039 --> 1326.0
that's all all part of denying god of

1324.32 --> 1328.799
atheism and of just this

1326.0 --> 1330.799
obsession that there does not need to be

1328.799 --> 1332.4
a creator for everything to exist the

1330.799 --> 1335.12
way it does

1332.4 --> 1335.52
and it's all nonsense it's a cult it's a

1335.12 --> 1338.559
cult

1335.52 --> 1341.36
on its own you know the globe it's like

1338.559 --> 1344.08
provable like a math cult math cult of

1341.36 --> 1347.6
ignorance and double think

1344.08 --> 1350.6399999999999
but atheism is is much more

1347.6 --> 1353.1999999999998
directly onto the ego it's like a

1350.64 --> 1356.72
personal

1353.2 --> 1356.72
decision and stubbornness

1359.36 --> 1362.4799999999998
hey tracy call

1404.64 --> 1407.76
i y s

1408.4 --> 1417.8400000000001
with i y s

1431.679 --> 1445.8400000000001
yes i know that

1435.76 --> 1445.84
tracy cole's been in this chat before

1456.84 --> 1461.759
mystical

1458.67 --> 1461.759
[Music]

1467.98 --> 1471.18
[Music]

1493.09 --> 1496.74
[Music]

1496.88 --> 1501.8400000000001
right so anyway

1504.799 --> 1508.32
i keep things kind of short

1511.2 --> 1518.32
but yeah

1514.72 --> 1521.279
a lot of the public relations

1518.32 --> 1523.76
that catholicism does is constantly

1521.279 --> 1526.4
trying to alter and deviate from the

1523.76 --> 1526.4
original

1527.36 --> 1534.6399999999999
bible situation the way of thinking

1531.76 --> 1535.44
even at as was what is supposed to be

1534.64 --> 1537.3600000000001
allowed

1535.44 --> 1538.96
and why and under what conditions they

1537.36 --> 1542.4799999999998
philosophize around

1538.96 --> 1544.96
everything and they've been doing that

1542.48 --> 1546.32
gradually for a long time it's like

1544.96 --> 1557.8400000000001
reversing

1546.32 --> 1557.84
the logos code

1569.279 --> 1572.32
you just read the book of enoch all

1571.84 --> 1574.6399999999999
right

1572.32 --> 1576.48
that's funny yeah i i just what i just

1574.64 --> 1579.5200000000002
happened to have watched

1576.48 --> 1584.08
a couple of videos from uh

1579.52 --> 1586.08
flat water flat earth he reads from the

1584.08 --> 1586.48
book of enoch in his videos a lot and

1586.08 --> 1590.24
shows

1586.48 --> 1592.64
google pictures and other bible stories

1590.24 --> 1592.64
too so

1594.0 --> 1600.0
i've never just literally read it though

1598.08 --> 1602.72
the entire thing i think i have the pdf

1600.0 --> 1613.84
on my computer somewhere

1602.72 --> 1613.84
but yeah

1653.12 --> 1659.36
you just learned about portals oh really

1656.799 --> 1660.48
oh yeah right that's in there as well

1659.36 --> 1664.08
right tracy cole

1660.48 --> 1667.039
in the book of enoch about well

1664.08 --> 1668.08
their attempts to describe the celestial

1667.039 --> 1671.36
workings

1668.08 --> 1674.48
they describe it using portals

1671.36 --> 1675.9189999999999
so yeah and if you do that there is

1674.48 --> 1679.84
still

1675.919 --> 1683.039
physicality assumption basically

1679.84 --> 1685.9189999999999
going on in order yeah to

1683.039 --> 1687.679
need portals to explain what i would

1685.919 --> 1688.88
explain as a purely holographic

1687.679 --> 1691.44
phenomena

1688.88 --> 1692.64
which is not a physical thing in a

1691.44 --> 1697.8400000000001
literal position

1692.64 --> 1697.8400000000001
being visible

1704.399 --> 1708.32
yeah when i first heard about the

1706.799 --> 1712.24
portals of the sun

1708.32 --> 1716.48
pretty early on as well from

1712.24 --> 1719.2
yeah from flat earth flat a flat water

1716.48 --> 1719.2
flare so

1720.159 --> 1723.679
from him reading the book of enoch that

1722.08 --> 1727.039
was also like what

1723.679 --> 1729.44
what like why portals

1727.039 --> 1731.76
and then i saw other people kind of

1729.44 --> 1734.559
trying to latch onto that talk about it

1731.76 --> 1736.24
on their flat earth videos just people

1734.559 --> 1739.6
just talking you know that

1736.24 --> 1741.679
in the beginning like 2015-16

1739.6 --> 1744.8799999999999
it was mostly just that just people

1741.679 --> 1746.799
talking about flat earth ideas

1744.88 --> 1748.7990000000002
there was no real coordination no

1746.799 --> 1751.52
organization

1748.799 --> 1752.08
everybody was just doing their own

1751.52 --> 1754.08
personal

1752.08 --> 1755.12
response into new material they came

1754.08 --> 1758.72
across

1755.12 --> 1761.52
and yeah the port of the sun nobody

1758.72 --> 1762.88
really seemed to get a good grip on that

1761.52 --> 1765.52
situation

1762.88 --> 1767.1200000000001
like nobody really even properly

1765.52 --> 1770.08
understood

1767.12 --> 1771.1999999999998
what exactly was being described they

1770.08 --> 1773.84
they would just

1771.2 --> 1774.96
be like portals fascinating oh what does

1773.84 --> 1777.12
that mean

1774.96 --> 1779.1200000000001
their fantasy would go wild over it but

1777.12 --> 1782.0
none of them really

1779.12 --> 1784.7199999999998
seem to be getting a solid cosmogeny

1782.0 --> 1788.48
data out of that

1784.72 --> 1792.159
and my me myself neither

1788.48 --> 1794.32
but it i guess it did kind of trigger

1792.159 --> 1797.6000000000001
the idea

1794.32 --> 1800.559
or like the inside the option

1797.6 --> 1802.9599999999998
that maybe maybe they aren't literal

1800.559 --> 1805.84
object name the celestial bodies

1802.96 --> 1806.32
are not just lights with i with which

1805.84 --> 1808.72
through

1806.32 --> 1809.76
physicality assumption bias would be

1808.72 --> 1812.799
imagined

1809.76 --> 1814.799
as like a local candle flame that gives

1812.799 --> 1815.44
is very long visible something like that

1814.799 --> 1817.36
you know that's

1815.44 --> 1819.279
what physicality assumption buyers do

1817.36 --> 1821.039
you compare it to something physical

1819.279 --> 1824.08
you know that relates that gives off

1821.039 --> 1826.48
light or it's going to be an object

1824.08 --> 1828.32
it's going to have light coming off it

1826.48 --> 1830.48
that's

1828.32 --> 1831.6
what we understand more about so that's

1830.48 --> 1833.76
what we associate

1831.6 --> 1836.08
things with with the celestials that

1833.76 --> 1838.96
physicality assumption buys and i first

1836.08 --> 1840.559
started noticing that through that book

1838.96 --> 1842.559
of enoch

1840.559 --> 1844.1589999999999
description of the portals of the sun

1842.559 --> 1847.84
and the moon

1844.159 --> 1850.5590000000002
and i started to understand like wait

1847.84 --> 1853.039
portals that seem that that can't be

1850.559 --> 1855.9189999999999
literal that makes no sense

1853.039 --> 1856.72
sun goes down in an apparent spot then

1855.919 --> 1859.919
yeah you see

1856.72 --> 1862.799
it going down over

1859.919 --> 1864.3200000000002
or onto the horizon but if somebody's

1862.799 --> 1868.08
standing there they're not

1864.32 --> 1871.12
literally getting bathed in sun

1868.08 --> 1871.12
so portal

1871.519 --> 1877.679
no portal would be like local

1874.88 --> 1879.3600000000001
as well like even the concept of looping

1877.679 --> 1882.64
within the realm that i

1879.36 --> 1885.9189999999999
kind of brought forth to the table

1882.64 --> 1889.3600000000001
it is local as well is spatial

1885.919 --> 1891.44
spatial local in the physical realm well

1889.36 --> 1893.12
the holographics of the celestial bodies

1891.44 --> 1894.799
are not local in any way they're not in

1893.12 --> 1896.7199999999998
any literal position they're just

1894.799 --> 1898.0
a parrot position in relation to the

1896.72 --> 1901.1200000000001
observer

1898.0 --> 1903.36
so well i figured that all out and a

1901.12 --> 1904.1589999999999
good proper way to explain it much much

1903.36 --> 1908.0
later that

1904.159 --> 1910.159
it's taken years years of me trying to

1908.0 --> 1911.919
get this idea out like they're not

1910.159 --> 1913.44
physical objects they're holographic

1911.919 --> 1915.279
and people like what the hell does that

1913.44 --> 1917.1200000000001
even mean and i'm like

1915.279 --> 1919.039
i'm not too sure yet what that means but

1917.12 --> 1921.6
i'm pretty sure i'm on to something

1919.039 --> 1923.12
it was like the first year mostly in

1921.6 --> 1926.399
chats and then later

1923.12 --> 1929.6
yeah people

1926.399 --> 1932.4799999999998
started to get used to it and then i

1929.6 --> 1934.0
expanded upon it and it became what it

1932.48 --> 1937.1200000000001
is right now and

1934.0 --> 1939.76
pretty happy to say perhaps proud proud

1937.12 --> 1939.76
although yeah

1939.84 --> 1946.8799999999999
that it's a wider understood

1943.2 --> 1950.24
concept among flat earthers not everyone

1946.88 --> 1951.7600000000002
but there's plenty that have kind of

1950.24 --> 1953.84
caught on to this concept

1951.76 --> 1955.519
the holographic a holographic nature

1953.84 --> 1957.9189999999999
non-literal positions

1955.519 --> 1958.96
they're starting to slowly catch on just

1957.919 --> 1962.0800000000002
as i have

1958.96 --> 1963.919
slowly caught on once again to optics

1962.08 --> 1965.36
it's still very intuitive to me because

1963.919 --> 1968.3990000000001
it's a very complex thing

1965.36 --> 1970.08
so many involved factors and yeah

1968.399 --> 1972.9599999999998
it's just very tough to get in there

1970.08 --> 1975.039
well so is the conceptualization

1972.96 --> 1976.0
of a holographic nature of the celestial

1975.039 --> 1980.559
bodies it's

1976.0 --> 1980.559
just tough takes time

1987.279 --> 2005.84
amp research okay

1990.559 --> 2005.84
i don't know who that is martin tolbert

2010.64 --> 2016.48
oh you're dyslexic tracy that's tough

2014.32 --> 2018.399
also my you know tech but what is

2016.48 --> 2019.919
dyslexia is it

2018.399 --> 2021.76
that you can't read or that you

2019.919 --> 2024.24
constantly for some reason get

2021.76 --> 2026.8799999999999
distracted from the reading

2024.24 --> 2028.64
because with me it's like selective

2026.88 --> 2032.0800000000002
dyslexia

2028.64 --> 2034.64
if i have reading material and it i

2032.08 --> 2037.36
i can absorb it like the frequency is

2034.64 --> 2039.8400000000001
right for me and it it provides exactly

2037.36 --> 2042.08
what my curiosity seeks

2039.84 --> 2044.08
then i'll have no trouble reading at all

2042.08 --> 2047.039
be very quick with it

2044.08 --> 2047.76
but if i have to just do general

2047.039 --> 2051.52
research

2047.76 --> 2053.52
up without knowing kind of specifically

2051.52 --> 2056.879
what it is then it takes a lot more

2053.52 --> 2060.24
trouble and i get distracted a lot

2056.879 --> 2061.679
a lot and the same thing happens to when

2060.24 --> 2066.6389999999997
i try to write things

2061.679 --> 2070.2400000000002
still i still haven't really progressed

2066.639 --> 2072.879
in making notes for my book

2070.24 --> 2075.919
that kind of stopped even though it's

2072.879 --> 2079.1189999999997
still in my mind like yeah i do

2075.919 --> 2080.56
i do really want to continue even though

2079.119 --> 2084.3990000000003
it's just two pages

2080.56 --> 2084.399
i should do more but it's just not

2085.919 --> 2092.72
that focus seems to have just like

2088.96 --> 2093.919
faded away for now but i trust that

2092.72 --> 2096.48
it'll get back because

2093.919 --> 2099.04
it is something that should that i just

2096.48 --> 2099.04
should do

2100.96 --> 2106.429
i want to do that

2103.32 --> 2106.429
[Music]

2118.72 --> 2122.56
right yet george sanford yeah that's

2124.4 --> 2130.7200000000003
right i'm not dyslectic

2127.599 --> 2134.32
like that although it took a little bit

2130.72 --> 2136.7999999999997
longer for me to get words right

2134.32 --> 2137.92
i guess for the average person even

2136.8 --> 2140.6400000000003
though verbally

2137.92 --> 2142.56
my verbal communication skills were just

2140.64 --> 2146.24
highly advanced

2142.56 --> 2148.96
probably 10 years ahead of everything

2146.24 --> 2149.4399999999996
but the writing part and the reading

2148.96 --> 2150.96
part

2149.44 --> 2153.28
had a little bit more difficult

2150.96 --> 2155.76
especially writing had more difficulty

2153.28 --> 2155.76
with that

2155.92 --> 2165.599
i don't anymore

2159.839 --> 2165.599
i don't misread it rarely happens

2165.76 --> 2170.32
but it's also i guess because of just

2167.68 --> 2173.52
diet being very careful with my diet and

2170.32 --> 2177.28
all it does help you know what you eat

2173.52 --> 2179.68
really does determine your overall skill

2177.28 --> 2179.6800000000003
range

2180.4 --> 2184.0
if you don't have the proper materials

2182.24 --> 2186.8799999999997
available in your body

2184.0 --> 2187.839
then yeah certain functions will just

2186.88 --> 2193.359
not

2187.839 --> 2193.359
work as smoothly or as long as required

2198.839 --> 2201.839
so

2226.839 --> 2229.839
anyway

2240.839 --> 2243.839
right

2270.4 --> 2288.32
hey in two

2284.88 --> 2292.079
right so next what's next

2288.32 --> 2295.28
we've got at least

2292.079 --> 2295.28
40 more minutes to go

2296.16 --> 2299.839
met a spirit

2305.2 --> 2309.4399999999996
okay stone monkey3d

2310.839 --> 2313.839
sure

2328.88 --> 2332.48
all right yeah tracy cole look i made

2330.88 --> 2336.079
spirits all the time i

2332.48 --> 2340.4
i just don't really make effort of

2336.079 --> 2343.2000000000003
getting acquainted anymore

2340.4 --> 2345.76
my spirits that i meet are just kind of

2343.2 --> 2345.7599999999998
annoying

2352.64 --> 2357.44
i think sometimes they're like just

2354.64 --> 2360.56
echoes of people

2357.44 --> 2363.28
people's frustration or something

2360.56 --> 2365.839
that are just projecting spiritually

2363.28 --> 2368.0
whether they know it or not i don't know

2365.839 --> 2369.7599999999998
probably not most people just have

2368.0 --> 2383.839
spiritual things that they do

2369.76 --> 2383.8390000000004
and without even realizing it

2394.839 --> 2397.839
hmm

2406.0 --> 2413.839
okay that's cool

2411.599 --> 2415.2000000000003
that's always a good sign if yeah the

2413.839 --> 2416.96
thing you are

2415.2 --> 2420.16
even from the outside what yeah if

2416.96 --> 2423.359
you're gonna use a plan

2420.16 --> 2425.5989999999997
for your cooking that that the seeds are

2423.359 --> 2427.119
still viable that you can literally put

2425.599 --> 2430.319
it in your own ground and grow something

2427.119 --> 2430.319
out if that's a good sign

2432.16 --> 2437.7599999999998
that it's at least not like sterile

2435.52 --> 2439.2
that it's not been i don't know what is

2437.76 --> 2442.8
it crossbred so

2439.2 --> 2445.839
badly that it's like no longer

2442.8 --> 2448.0
natural that it can't procreate anymore

2445.839 --> 2448.88
because yeah in the regular food

2448.0 --> 2467.839
industry

2448.88 --> 2467.839
i think that is done a lot anyway

2475.599 --> 2481.52
no agm that's you don't know what that

2479.68 --> 2486.0
is

2481.52 --> 2486.0
you know dude i've done that

2487.92 --> 2491.52
and i'm pretty sure that when i do that

2490.4 --> 2494.8
i'm not

2491.52 --> 2497.2
like contacting a demon or anything i

2494.8 --> 2498.88
barely get information out anyway

2497.2 --> 2500.96
because i don't want to grab that deep

2498.88 --> 2501.92
because hey if i did that then maybe i

2500.96 --> 2504.319
would indeed get

2501.92 --> 2506.2400000000002
negative attachments and whatever a

2504.319 --> 2509.359
demon

2506.24 --> 2510.24
so hey if somebody wants to know

2509.359 --> 2513.359
something

2510.24 --> 2514.64
or has a feel towards like an ancestor

2513.359 --> 2516.48
or whatever

2514.64 --> 2517.839
they want to reach out then i'll just

2516.48 --> 2520.4
give them a little notch

2517.839 --> 2521.599
a little hint it's usually enough you

2520.4 --> 2524.7200000000003
know

2521.599 --> 2527.2000000000003
if people experience or get

2524.72 --> 2527.7599999999998
affirmed that they have a contact

2527.2 --> 2530.64
feeling

2527.76 --> 2532.8
with something then after that point

2530.64 --> 2533.52
usually they don't really even need any

2532.8 --> 2536.6400000000003
advice

2533.52 --> 2540.319
they just need confirmation that what

2536.64 --> 2540.319
their experience is sort of real

2540.72 --> 2543.7599999999998
and then get it properly contexted so

2542.8 --> 2546.96
they don't

2543.76 --> 2551.119
i don't know start to get wild ideas

2546.96 --> 2552.2400000000002
you know but yeah if somebody's like

2551.119 --> 2557.359
that like oh

2552.24 --> 2559.2799999999997
spirits oh you're into spirits could you

2557.359 --> 2561.2799999999997
what do you know about this or could you

2559.28 --> 2564.2400000000002
ask that and then i'll just do it

2561.28 --> 2565.76
just just like that i'm not like oh i'm

2564.24 --> 2570.24
gonna have to meditate or

2565.76 --> 2573.76
no i'm just like focus do it

2570.24 --> 2576.16
and just bang get back an answer

2573.76 --> 2577.0400000000004
or i get back no answer and then i'll

2576.16 --> 2579.5989999999997
say like no i

2577.04 --> 2581.04
specifically didn't get an answer that's

2579.599 --> 2584.319
what i do

2581.04 --> 2585.2
it keeps things simple don't have to

2584.319 --> 2588.16
like oh

2585.2 --> 2590.24
work myself up to do all kinds of things

2588.16 --> 2593.7599999999998
with my physical energy no no i just let

2590.24 --> 2597.2
my spirit purity

2593.76 --> 2600.4
be i guess like a mirror of water

2597.2 --> 2604.0789999999997
still and then

2600.4 --> 2604.96
i still it and then i let an idea in

2604.079 --> 2607.6800000000003
information

2604.96 --> 2608.48
a concept touch that and then let the

2607.68 --> 2611.2799999999997
ripples

2608.48 --> 2614.96
of it just tell give the answer you know

2611.28 --> 2618.3190000000004
it's a metaphorical description

2614.96 --> 2621.76
the mirror being basically my mind

2618.319 --> 2624.56
and my spirit

2621.76 --> 2627.0400000000004
water on on it and yeah that's just how

2624.56 --> 2627.04
i do that

2628.96 --> 2635.839
i'm not very procedural like that

2632.16 --> 2635.839
with spiritual matters i'm not

2637.68 --> 2640.8799999999997
i'm much more procedural when it comes

2640.319 --> 2644.96
to

2640.88 --> 2644.96
yeah taking care of the earthly part of

2646.839 --> 2649.839
myself

2650.56 --> 2657.52
and hey maybe if i'm like a

2654.96 --> 2659.04
temporary stress situation or whatever i

2657.52 --> 2663.04
feel i'm being

2659.04 --> 2666.24
crawled up up upon by dark spirits

2663.04 --> 2668.16
which does happen sometimes then i do

2666.24 --> 2670.64
have a procedure

2668.16 --> 2672.24
spiritual like a chant the combat chant

2670.64 --> 2675.52
remember

2672.24 --> 2679.04
that that i will procedurally do but

2675.52 --> 2681.04
that sort of thing is kind of rare

2679.04 --> 2684.48
like because when i'm just in a good

2681.04 --> 2688.839
position when my spirit is stable

2684.48 --> 2692.2400000000002
i feel very confident i i don't need

2688.839 --> 2705.839
anything it's just matter of

2692.24 --> 2705.839
access to information to me

2708.0 --> 2710.319
what

2712.88 --> 2719.839
angels and demons really

2730.839 --> 2733.839
so

2776.96 --> 2783.359
yeah agm you still need just drink a lot

2780.319 --> 2789.839
of water and vitamin c

2783.359 --> 2789.839
works great

2800.839 --> 2803.839
huh

2814.839 --> 2820.48
hmm

2817.52 --> 2820.48
greasy food

2825.119 --> 2831.839
well mark collard what and a beer no

2828.72 --> 2831.839
don't do that

2832.0 --> 2836.079
now first what you need is just plenty

2834.96 --> 2839.76
of water

2836.079 --> 2843.44
because hey a hangover technically is

2839.76 --> 2846.3190000000004
alcohol poisoning or dehydration

2843.44 --> 2847.68
due to alcohol poisoning because getting

2846.319 --> 2850.88
rid of alcohol in the body

2847.68 --> 2853.7599999999998
takes a lot of water

2850.88 --> 2853.76
to get it all out

2856.24 --> 2862.8799999999997
so first water and then greasy food

2859.68 --> 2865.359
but that's usually after you already

2862.88 --> 2866.8
have rehydrated which gets rid of most

2865.359 --> 2868.7999999999997
of the hangover part

2866.8 --> 2870.88
you might just be slow and then usually

2868.8 --> 2874.7200000000003
the hunger really hits

2870.88 --> 2874.7200000000003
and that's when like yeah you get

2878.24 --> 2882.319
baked eggs or something you know some

2880.64 --> 2883.68
people do with bacon or whatever

2882.319 --> 2887.839
something in that direct yeah that

2883.68 --> 2887.839
really does hit the spot

2888.559 --> 2892.96
unless you've like been really sick from

2890.96 --> 2894.88
too much alcohol then it becomes a bit

2892.96 --> 2896.8
more difficult because your stomach has

2894.88 --> 2899.119
to calm down a little more and it won't

2896.8 --> 2901.8390000000004
handle all that grease all that well

2899.119 --> 2901.839
so

2918.64 --> 2921.699
[Music]

2926.839 --> 2929.839
me

2940.16 --> 2944.3999999999996
yeah but i get it agm look red wine is

2942.96 --> 2947.68
kind of tricky

2944.4 --> 2949.6800000000003
i drink red wine i usually start out

2947.68 --> 2952.64
bears these days

2949.68 --> 2955.04
and then end up with red wine which yeah

2952.64 --> 2957.5989999999997
sounds weird

2955.04 --> 2959.359
but if i drink some red wine after the

2957.599 --> 2962.8
beers in the evening

2959.359 --> 2965.359
i actually feel better the next day than

2962.8 --> 2967.6800000000003
if i don't drink wine on top of the same

2965.359 --> 2971.2
amount of beers

2967.68 --> 2974.319
yeah so in my mind

2971.2 --> 2974.96
what it kind of does i guess is it's

2974.319 --> 2978.4
more

2974.96 --> 2979.04
acidic the detaining and all that yeah

2978.4 --> 2982.079
it's all

2979.04 --> 2982.64
components that the body i guess kind of

2982.079 --> 2985.04
needs

2982.64 --> 2985.7599999999998
after beer which is really fizzy so it

2985.04 --> 2987.7599999999998
kind of like

2985.76 --> 2989.119
makes it settle and then solve some of

2987.76 --> 2992.8
the issues

2989.119 --> 2995.92
it does work out much better for me

2992.8 --> 2998.2400000000002
but yeah if you overdo red wine

2995.92 --> 2999.92
and i can absolutely feel it you know

2998.24 --> 3004.0789999999997
there's like this

2999.92 --> 3006.8
weird red wine nausea meter

3004.079 --> 3009.04
and it's very linear for me it's like

3006.8 --> 3011.599
when i get sick of red wine it's really

3009.04 --> 3015.2
my own fault because i should have known

3011.599 --> 3017.2000000000003
and i'm like oh no i wanted more when i

3015.2 --> 3019.7599999999998
can definitely feel like if i'm gonna

3017.2 --> 3022.319
take just a tiny little bit

3019.76 --> 3025.28
i am gonna be a tiny little bit more

3022.319 --> 3029.839
sick and i'm gonna be sorry about it

3025.28 --> 3031.599
so red wine you just got to be sure to

3029.839 --> 3035.119
keep track of how much you're drinking

3031.599 --> 3038.079
and that you don't start ignoring

3035.119 --> 3039.44
your stomach concerning that also what

3038.079 --> 3041.44
really does help

3039.44 --> 3042.64
if you're gonna drink red wine is just

3041.44 --> 3046.319
have a really good

3042.64 --> 3048.48
meal in between that or before it

3046.319 --> 3051.2799999999997
you know because red wine on a on a

3048.48 --> 3055.839
halfway empty stomach is terrible

3051.28 --> 3055.8390000000004
it's not good

3058.24 --> 3062.5589999999997
yeah but hm look that's really your own

3060.64 --> 3066.48
fault you know as i said

3062.559 --> 3068.8
when you drink red wine you need to

3066.48 --> 3070.96
yeah but it's not snack snack snacking

3068.8 --> 3074.4
next to red wine does not help

3070.96 --> 3077.44
like crisps of any kind no

3074.4 --> 3077.839
no no no you need a proper meal next to

3077.44 --> 3081.92
that

3077.839 --> 3083.2
if you don't then it's going to hurt

3081.92 --> 3086.4
that's why i never

3083.2 --> 3090.7999999999997
would never drink red wine

3086.4 --> 3093.599
before dark ever i'd never do that

3090.8 --> 3097.8390000000004
just doesn't feel right i gotta have a

3093.599 --> 3097.839
meal in me

3101.2 --> 3105.9199999999996
so yeah if you're gonna drink red wine

3103.52 --> 3107.52
relatively early for whatever reason i'd

3105.92 --> 3112.88
i take a really

3107.52 --> 3112.88
proper lunch and not a basic lunch

3115.76 --> 3125.8390000000004
but yeah that's me that's that's my

3117.76 --> 3125.8390000000004
advice on dealing with that

3136.839 --> 3139.839
so

3142.559 --> 3149.28
right yeah mark collard i know

3146.88 --> 3150.88
well what alco very typically does is

3149.28 --> 3152.48
that if there are things

3150.88 --> 3155.28
you're trying to deal with that you

3152.48 --> 3158.16
don't like that you're keeping bubble up

3155.28 --> 3159.52
then alcohol will it's probably the

3158.16 --> 3162.5589999999997
primary

3159.52 --> 3164.559
effect it causes that is most known for

3162.559 --> 3169.44
people will start to bl

3164.559 --> 3172.7200000000003
blur out uh yeah blur out blurt out

3169.44 --> 3174.079
their dissatisfaction so yeah people

3172.72 --> 3177.68
getting too drunk on

3174.079 --> 3179.599
on company parties they start suddenly

3177.68 --> 3181.359
yelling at their boss and then they get

3179.599 --> 3182.7200000000003
fired

3181.359 --> 3184.24
because they've been sitting on

3182.72 --> 3186.24
something they were really pissed off

3184.24 --> 3188.4799999999996
about about code of conduct or whatever

3186.24 --> 3190.0
or something that the guy done

3188.48 --> 3191.52
but they didn't do anything with it

3190.0 --> 3192.72
because they didn't know what to do with

3191.52 --> 3195.119
it

3192.72 --> 3196.7999999999997
they were just too gamma about it and

3195.119 --> 3198.48
then they get drunk and they blurt it

3196.8 --> 3200.88
all out and then they get fired

3198.48 --> 3205.04
because it's stupid to do that so yeah

3200.88 --> 3205.04
that typically does happen with alcohol

3207.359 --> 3211.04
and that's why hey if you're going to be

3210.0 --> 3214.16
a gamma

3211.04 --> 3216.48
passive aggressive about a lot of things

3214.16 --> 3218.16
then you got to be very careful with

3216.48 --> 3220.079
your alcohol because you're constantly

3218.16 --> 3222.64
being going to be suppressing [ __ ]

3220.079 --> 3224.079
that the alcohol is going to naturally

3222.64 --> 3225.52
let out

3224.079 --> 3227.44
and that what you're going to let out is

3225.52 --> 3229.0
going to be troublemaking for sure

3227.44 --> 3231.2000000000003
because it's your personal

3229.0 --> 3233.44
dissatisfaction with the world

3231.2 --> 3233.4399999999996
see

3235.44 --> 3240.16
yeah and that's why also plenty of

3237.839 --> 3243.2
people that drink

3240.16 --> 3247.359
and alcoholics too they get really

3243.2 --> 3251.5989999999997
freaking annoying they just turn into

3247.359 --> 3254.72
noisy whiny complainy pants depressed

3251.599 --> 3256.88
maybe even aggressive because they got

3254.72 --> 3258.319
all that [ __ ] bottled up inside them

3256.88 --> 3260.0
they don't know how to deal with it and

3258.319 --> 3261.2
they did then it comes out with the

3260.0 --> 3263.68
alcohol it's not

3261.2 --> 3265.4399999999996
solved just usually makes things even

3263.68 --> 3268.72
worse

3265.44 --> 3272.2400000000002
creates widens the rift

3268.72 --> 3276.319
between the ego and the society

3272.24 --> 3276.319
see that's what that does

3277.68 --> 3282.24
if you don't solve the dissatisfaction

3280.72 --> 3284.8799999999997
you're keeping inside

3282.24 --> 3285.4399999999996
yet drinking and then causing more

3284.88 --> 3288.48
damage

3285.44 --> 3288.48
letting it out like that

3289.92 --> 3293.6800000000003
alcohol is a depressant no that's not

3292.0 --> 3296.799
true

3293.68 --> 3299.839
no it's it releases

3296.799 --> 3300.72
it's a reliever it really it just takes

3299.839 --> 3303.359
away certain

3300.72 --> 3306.0789999999997
it breaks certain tensions open so it's

3303.359 --> 3307.68
releasing it releases tension

3306.079 --> 3309.599
but yeah if you're sitting on tension

3307.68 --> 3313.2799999999997
that when released is gonna do

3309.599 --> 3314.559
all create havoc yeah then that could be

3313.28 --> 3318.88
dangerous

3314.559 --> 3322.0
you know like but

3318.88 --> 3324.319
if you completely get wasted if you

3322.0 --> 3325.28
literally just keep tanking like heavy

3324.319 --> 3327.2
liquor

3325.28 --> 3329.28
and some people in chat here knows

3327.2 --> 3332.799
exactly like that and yeah drugs

3329.28 --> 3335.76
too heavy drugs heroin and such

3332.799 --> 3337.52
then yeah you literally get numbed and

3335.76 --> 3339.3590000000004
then it doesn't really matter anymore

3337.52 --> 3341.119
what you're feeling because you're so

3339.359 --> 3343.2799999999997
out of your body into a different

3341.119 --> 3345.359
experience that

3343.28 --> 3347.44
you don't even get a chance then to

3345.359 --> 3349.2
remember the shitty things

3347.44 --> 3352.559
right but that's because of total

3349.2 --> 3355.68
intoxication that's not just regular

3352.559 --> 3357.28
alcohol effect that's not a social

3355.68 --> 3360.3999999999996
influence then you're wasted

3357.28 --> 3363.28
and hey if you get wasted enough your

3360.4 --> 3366.88
body will start to very

3363.28 --> 3367.76
yeah deteriorate and if you persist then

3366.88 --> 3370.799
it will become

3367.76 --> 3373.44
permanent so yeah

3370.799 --> 3374.64
getting waste is terrible idea always is

3373.44 --> 3376.7200000000003
you know

3374.64 --> 3377.839
most people that do drink typically get

3376.72 --> 3380.48
wasted in their

3377.839 --> 3383.04
in their late youths when they're like

3380.48 --> 3386.2400000000002
teenagers late teenagers or something

3383.04 --> 3388.72
but yeah that is logical

3386.24 --> 3390.64
because hey what are teenagers known for

3388.72 --> 3392.799
that they typically have to deal with

3390.64 --> 3394.5589999999997
extreme feelings and emotions that they

3392.799 --> 3396.96
don't really know how to place

3394.559 --> 3397.8390000000004
they bottle it up because they can't do

3396.96 --> 3401.119
anything else with it

3397.839 --> 3403.92
then the alcohol rams it all out

3401.119 --> 3405.2000000000003
so they get wasted and then they unborn

3403.92 --> 3407.6800000000003
and burden all that for

3405.2 --> 3407.68
a few

3409.68 --> 3412.799
this is very typical

3413.119 --> 3419.839
but later in life

3416.559 --> 3423.52
you should not

3419.839 --> 3427.68
have the same type of

3423.52 --> 3430.839
bottled up stress you know the teenage

3427.68 --> 3433.04
angst and all that should go away in the

3430.839 --> 3436.48
development

3433.04 --> 3440.48
if you have the developed

3436.48 --> 3444.319
if you take on the responsibility

3440.48 --> 3446.88
of becoming more than just a

3444.319 --> 3449.44
yeah a wild teenager that refuses to

3446.88 --> 3449.44
grow up

3459.52 --> 3462.72
yeah binge drinking

3464.16 --> 3467.92
right i'm just trying look i'm not

3466.079 --> 3470.1600000000003
condoning that at all

3467.92 --> 3471.2000000000003
like you know especially because

3470.16 --> 3473.52
something

3471.2 --> 3474.799
look the problem really comes in when a

3473.52 --> 3478.64
teen

3474.799 --> 3481.28
starts binge drinking and

3478.64 --> 3482.799
they're not sensitive to alcohol then

3481.28 --> 3483.3590000000004
you got a problem because then they

3482.799 --> 3486.4
drink

3483.359 --> 3488.16
a lot and even though they might not

3486.4 --> 3490.799
experience it as much

3488.16 --> 3491.44
or they just don't sense how much they

3490.799 --> 3492.88
are actually

3491.44 --> 3495.76
influenced so they're not having it the

3492.88 --> 3497.559
consciousness fun out of it i guess

3495.76 --> 3499.6800000000003
yeah they're still gonna have all the

3497.559 --> 3501.0400000000004
deterioration and the development

3499.68 --> 3504.16
influence

3501.04 --> 3506.799
you know i

3504.16 --> 3508.64
am really sensitive to alcohol compared

3506.799 --> 3512.799
to most and that's why

3508.64 --> 3515.52
yeah that's why i'm probably not a

3512.799 --> 3518.16
raging alcoholic

3515.52 --> 3520.64
because it just can't get there i can't

3518.16 --> 3520.96
i can't handle that much alco i can't

3520.64 --> 3523.359
get

3520.96 --> 3525.28
used to look i've been drinking now on a

3523.359 --> 3528.799
daily basis

3525.28 --> 3530.0
for two years it's yeah when i say it

3528.799 --> 3533.04
like that kind of worries me

3530.0 --> 3535.599
a bit but

3533.04 --> 3537.44
i'm not like drinking a giant crate of

3535.599 --> 3539.599
beer now it's like oh

3537.44 --> 3541.599
it's been two weeks i'm gonna have to

3539.599 --> 3543.28
take another beer or it's not gonna have

3541.599 --> 3545.28
the same effect no no no

3543.28 --> 3546.48
no i still have pretty much the same

3545.28 --> 3549.2000000000003
amount i

3546.48 --> 3550.559
drank a little more because it was so

3549.2 --> 3553.9199999999996
hot and then

3550.559 --> 3556.3190000000004
like yeah mix it in with the the rattler

3553.92 --> 3558.4
half lemon juice so it's a different

3556.319 --> 3560.799
experience it's more about the water and

3558.4 --> 3562.799
just having a little alcohol to widen

3560.799 --> 3564.48
the arteries in order to let the heat

3562.799 --> 3566.16
out that works

3564.48 --> 3568.079
you don't drink too much alcohol at the

3566.16 --> 3571.1189999999997
same time

3568.079 --> 3572.6400000000003
but overall i haven't really increased

3571.119 --> 3574.7200000000003
in dosage

3572.64 --> 3576.24
in all that time despite it being a

3574.72 --> 3579.7599999999998
daily thing

3576.24 --> 3580.24
because my body just can't get used to

3579.76 --> 3583.92
it

3580.24 --> 3583.9199999999996
it just no it's not going to happen

3584.079 --> 3588.2400000000002
try to get over that board i shouldn't

3586.4 --> 3591.119
want to and i don't want to but when i

3588.24 --> 3594.16
sometimes get a bit

3591.119 --> 3596.079
whatever i think that i'm suddenly

3594.16 --> 3597.68
more and make a stupid decision to take

3596.079 --> 3602.2400000000002
more and it's just going to be

3597.68 --> 3604.72
like no it was too much

3602.24 --> 3606.64
it is still too much and it's going to

3604.72 --> 3607.4399999999996
be too much so it's just a border i

3606.64 --> 3610.0
should

3607.44 --> 3610.7200000000003
just never really pass even though i

3610.0 --> 3615.2
will

3610.72 --> 3617.2799999999997
just to test if if it was real

3615.2 --> 3621.04
you know that's like the only reason i

3617.28 --> 3624.96
even go over those borders to test like

3621.04 --> 3626.96
is that real was it really that much

3624.96 --> 3629.119
and then it's like yeah yeah i was yeah

3626.96 --> 3631.359
yeah then i don't need to test it for a

3629.119 --> 3631.359
while

3640.839 --> 3644.72
anyway

3642.88 --> 3646.0
i seem to be aware of what i do yeah

3644.72 --> 3648.8799999999997
well i'm constantly

3646.0 --> 3648.88
i make notes

3651.76 --> 3658.7200000000003
and yeah to be fair my life is not super

3656.24 --> 3660.9599999999996
busy overall so

3658.72 --> 3662.16
it can actually fit in my head very

3660.96 --> 3664.16
easily

3662.16 --> 3665.44
because people that just have like

3664.16 --> 3667.68
complex full-time

3665.44 --> 3669.359
jobs and families it's just got to be

3667.68 --> 3671.64
too much to keep it all in their heads

3669.359 --> 3674.319
all at once so they have to kind of like

3671.64 --> 3675.7599999999998
compartmentalize read write down it's

3674.319 --> 3676.88
not going to be in their heads all of

3675.76 --> 3678.7200000000003
the time

3676.88 --> 3680.319
i don't know except maybe for mothers

3678.72 --> 3681.839
and details about the kids because they

3680.319 --> 3682.839
just have the special instinct or

3681.839 --> 3686.88
something

3682.839 --> 3689.68
but yeah i live

3686.88 --> 3691.44
not too complicated life i do the show i

3689.68 --> 3692.3999999999996
hang around on the internet i follow

3691.44 --> 3695.76
things i study

3692.4 --> 3699.44
everything with what i do

3695.76 --> 3703.44
spend a lot of time or rating

3699.44 --> 3706.559
trying to be a teacher but

3703.44 --> 3709.52
it's not that not that complicated

3706.559 --> 3711.44
and the complicated expert knowledge

3709.52 --> 3713.2
that i typically deal with the cosmogeny

3711.44 --> 3715.44
issues trying to explain the holographic

3713.2 --> 3718.24
nature of the heavenly bodies all this

3715.44 --> 3719.76
gravity what is it really oh that's

3718.24 --> 3722.3999999999996
that's peanuts to me that's

3719.76 --> 3723.8390000000004
my that's my part of my expertise it's

3722.4 --> 3726.319
really easy for me

3723.839 --> 3727.599
because i'm so doing it all the time i'm

3726.319 --> 3730.48
so used to it

3727.599 --> 3731.119
it doesn't cost me energy at all like at

3730.48 --> 3733.68
all

3731.119 --> 3734.88
it's very cheap it's a cheap thing for

3733.68 --> 3739.2799999999997
me to do that

3734.88 --> 3741.92
energy wise now it used to be tougher

3739.28 --> 3743.6800000000003
but the tougher part was more to be able

3741.92 --> 3747.119
to uphold

3743.68 --> 3748.3999999999996
good structured proper intellectual

3747.119 --> 3750.88
sentences

3748.4 --> 3752.64
while at the same time being conscious

3750.88 --> 3754.319
that it's being filmed and being live

3752.64 --> 3755.44
watched and it's going to echo on into

3754.319 --> 3759.2799999999997
the world for

3755.44 --> 3763.76
unforeseen long time now that part

3759.28 --> 3766.1600000000003
that realization part was tougher for me

3763.76 --> 3767.3590000000004
was more pressuring than actually doing

3766.16 --> 3770.799
the technical thing

3767.359 --> 3773.839
because that comes easy to me i'm i'm

3770.799 --> 3775.68
just like that talking has always been

3773.839 --> 3783.839
very technical

3775.68 --> 3783.839
for me so

3813.119 --> 3825.839
all right

3835.039 --> 3841.599
yeah mark collard well

3839.52 --> 3844.079
only four puffs well that's how it

3841.599 --> 3847.52
started with me too you know

3844.079 --> 3847.52
at 15 no less

3848.16 --> 3854.16
through friends and then because my

3851.599 --> 3856.079
family was kind of like a cannabis

3854.16 --> 3857.359
condoner even at the time we were very

3856.079 --> 3860.799
much for it

3857.359 --> 3863.2799999999997
they they they hid it before you know

3860.799 --> 3865.119
they they didn't tell us that they were

3863.28 --> 3867.44
they they were smoking cigarettes at a

3865.119 --> 3871.119
time then we were all against that oh

3867.44 --> 3873.119
cigarettes bad evil we hated it stinks

3871.119 --> 3874.799
they stopped that but they still kept

3873.119 --> 3876.1600000000003
smoking cannabis but they did it in

3874.799 --> 3878.319
secret

3876.16 --> 3880.16
and then when i when it became apparent

3878.319 --> 3881.2799999999997
that i was kind of trying it out on my

3880.16 --> 3884.48
own with some

3881.28 --> 3886.7200000000003
not too reliable friends this is before

3884.48 --> 3888.4
the jesuit guy by the way

3886.72 --> 3890.24
then they kind of like okay if you're

3888.4 --> 3892.4
gonna do this

3890.24 --> 3894.72
yeah we we don't want you to just hang

3892.4 --> 3898.319
out with these people because they're

3894.72 --> 3901.9199999999996
like they could see that these people

3898.319 --> 3903.92
were not really interested in me

3901.92 --> 3905.6800000000003
but i was so naive i would just get

3903.92 --> 3908.0
dragged along and i was just like whoa

3905.68 --> 3912.319
i'm trying new stuff

3908.0 --> 3914.799
but i wasn't very careful socially yet

3912.319 --> 3917.0389999999998
so they basically said okay you're

3914.799 --> 3919.7599999999998
you're just gonna smoke here and we

3917.039 --> 3920.96
are going to provide you some clean

3919.76 --> 3923.92
cannabis

3920.96 --> 3925.76
and hey if you're into that then well

3923.92 --> 3928.079
why don't you just grow some

3925.76 --> 3929.8390000000004
some of that in the garden you know get

3928.079 --> 3931.2000000000003
do something with it and i was like oh

3929.839 --> 3937.839
yeah sure

3931.2 --> 3937.839
that's awesome i want to do that

3942.48 --> 3948.2400000000002
but yeah i started roughly when i was 15

3948.559 --> 3956.4
but by the time i was 17

3951.68 --> 3959.5989999999997
i was a chain smoker

3956.4 --> 3961.6800000000003
i was like a chain i would smoke several

3959.599 --> 3966.1600000000003
joints a day

3961.68 --> 3968.24
and i kind of saw it coming

3966.16 --> 3971.0389999999998
even in the beginning like i knew it was

3968.24 --> 3971.0389999999998
going to go there

3971.44 --> 3981.28
and i don't know i didn't stop it

3979.28 --> 3982.799
and yeah on one hand there were there's

3981.28 --> 3984.6400000000003
a whole swath of people even

3982.799 --> 3987.2
especially back then they were very

3984.64 --> 3989.2
judgmental towards me about that

3987.2 --> 3991.52
they were calling me like a junkie and

3989.2 --> 3994.799
all that and in a way it

3991.52 --> 3995.68
kind of was it was my way of trying to

3994.799 --> 3998.079
deal with

3995.68 --> 3999.68
very stressful situations even within

3998.079 --> 4003.8390000000004
the family like

3999.68 --> 4006.72
my relation between my dad and my mom

4003.839 --> 4010.799
going very bad

4006.72 --> 4010.799
during that time and

4011.119 --> 4014.559
me not really knowing what the [ __ ] to

4013.599 --> 4017.3590000000004
do with the world

4014.559 --> 4017.76
like my career what am i gonna do i had

4017.359 --> 4021.7599999999998
no

4017.76 --> 4025.28
grip and nobody nobody out there

4021.76 --> 4025.28
was handing me a good idea

4025.599 --> 4030.079
they had nobody that i knew had a really

4028.4 --> 4033.2000000000003
good grip

4030.079 --> 4035.3590000000004
on the world themselves i guess my

4033.2 --> 4037.52
brother was one of the better ones but

4035.359 --> 4039.2
he only had it concerning what he was

4037.52 --> 4040.96
going to do and he became a program and

4039.2 --> 4043.52
he was very tenacious but it was also

4040.96 --> 4046.7200000000003
very punishing to him

4043.52 --> 4049.599
like he ended up not liking it at all

4046.72 --> 4050.24
so much issues with with colleagues and

4049.599 --> 4053.92
bosses

4050.24 --> 4055.359
there's just horrific so it's very much

4053.92 --> 4058.4
against the code of

4055.359 --> 4060.839
programming what he was forced to do a

4058.4 --> 4063.6800000000003
lot of the time

4060.839 --> 4066.88
and

4063.68 --> 4070.16
yeah he he didn't like the smoking part

4066.88 --> 4071.039
at all wait i'm losing track of what i

4070.16 --> 4075.2
was saying

4071.039 --> 4078.7200000000003
uh and my brother always hated smoking

4075.2 --> 4082.319
cannabis smoking too but i

4078.72 --> 4085.7599999999998
yeah i liked it it for me

4082.319 --> 4089.0389999999998
it really triggered my communication

4085.76 --> 4092.88
skills and visualizations that

4089.039 --> 4096.0
it it started it broke open my mouth

4092.88 --> 4099.279
towards other people before that time i

4096.0 --> 4102.64
would barely talk to people

4099.279 --> 4106.4800000000005
barely and if i did it would be some

4102.64 --> 4109.679
weird obsession thing usually like

4106.48 --> 4112.639999999999
some computer game or i was always

4109.679 --> 4113.359
very uncertain about just talking just

4112.64 --> 4118.400000000001
being me

4113.359 --> 4121.359
verbally i was afraid afraid

4118.4 --> 4122.96
but cannabis kind of like it smoothed it

4121.359 --> 4126.88
out it just made like that

4122.96 --> 4129.12
afraidness was just it was gone

4126.88 --> 4131.04
and then i just was able to suddenly

4129.12 --> 4134.96
just be myself and talk and like

4131.04 --> 4137.759
figure out who am i and but yeah

4134.96 --> 4139.679
despite that opening that opportunity

4137.759 --> 4140.4
that it did give me for at the time

4139.679 --> 4142.64
being

4140.4 --> 4144.799
to develop myself in a social way that i

4142.64 --> 4147.279
couldn't before

4144.799 --> 4148.88
it didn't really provide me any answer

4147.279 --> 4150.56
as to like yeah what are you really

4148.88 --> 4153.04
gonna do with this world

4150.56 --> 4155.839000000001
what are you gonna do in this world what

4153.04 --> 4158.239
is your profession

4155.839 --> 4158.88
and yeah nobody could give me a good

4158.239 --> 4161.678999999999
hint

4158.88 --> 4162.719
my parents just said i just try art just

4161.679 --> 4164.799
just do

4162.719 --> 4166.2390000000005
art you're always so creative great

4164.799 --> 4169.44
painting and

4166.239 --> 4172.5599999999995
maybe something music and it all just

4169.44 --> 4174.799
it didn't fit it's like no this

4172.56 --> 4176.719
doesn't matter it's going to just i'm

4174.799 --> 4178.08
going to turn out like a shadow of what

4176.719 --> 4182.96
i could be it's

4178.08 --> 4182.96
i couldn't i couldn't do it

4186.319 --> 4191.679
it didn't work in the end

4191.759 --> 4198.4
but this i don't know

4195.12 --> 4201.199
this does work despite all the

4198.4 --> 4204.32
yes signs from the outside all the

4201.199 --> 4209.599999999999
discouragement all the trolls

4204.32 --> 4212.88
this does work and when i think about it

4209.6 --> 4216.08
20 years ago or more if i

4212.88 --> 4219.1990000000005
could have possibly felt that

4216.08 --> 4221.199
this situation and who i am now was

4219.199 --> 4224.5599999999995
coming

4221.199 --> 4227.839999999999
then then it would be to me like

4224.56 --> 4229.4400000000005
yeah of course of course that's what i'm

4227.84 --> 4230.0
gonna become i'm gonna become an

4229.44 --> 4231.44
isolated

4230.0 --> 4233.6
guy that's still going to be good at

4231.44 --> 4236.879999999999
what he does is going to

4233.6 --> 4238.96
create ripples of understanding far

4236.88 --> 4239.76
beyond what typical controllers would

4238.96 --> 4242.719
like

4239.76 --> 4242.719
that's it really because

4242.96 --> 4247.84
i really just want to ruin their stupid

4245.52 --> 4250.96
little mind control game that's

4247.84 --> 4252.400000000001
the primary thing i want i want to ruin

4250.96 --> 4256.84
it

4252.4 --> 4259.599999999999
just shatter it all with with

4256.84 --> 4261.52
raging raging bright

4259.6 --> 4263.679
understanding and insight that just

4261.52 --> 4266.96
shatters it all

4263.679 --> 4268.4800000000005
because that [ __ ] was horrific to me in

4266.96 --> 4271.12
my youth

4268.48 --> 4273.28
that's also the reason because i was

4271.12 --> 4276.159
first like no i want to be a scientist

4273.28 --> 4277.5199999999995
i want to be a scientist i want to build

4276.159 --> 4280.4
freaking lasers

4277.52 --> 4281.679
and maybe like find out some new type of

4280.4 --> 4284.5599999999995
energy development

4281.679 --> 4286.08
and i'm going to just i'm going to build

4284.56 --> 4287.6
space stations yeah because i still

4286.08 --> 4288.8
believe in the ball but i was just like

4287.6 --> 4291.84
yeah i'm going to do all that

4288.8 --> 4294.56
i am going to do that you know and then

4291.84 --> 4296.4800000000005
it was like okay well we got this

4294.56 --> 4298.0
project and we got that project

4296.48 --> 4299.599999999999
this is what you would be doing and i'm

4298.0 --> 4303.76
like

4299.6 --> 4306.08
but that's [ __ ] that doesn't do anything

4303.76 --> 4307.92
it's just blabbering it's just being

4306.08 --> 4309.92
freaking arrogant with a piece of paper

4307.92 --> 4312.2390000000005
and fooling a lot of people that's not

4309.92 --> 4314.8
science that's not development

4312.239 --> 4315.44
that doesn't do anything it's like yeah

4314.8 --> 4318.56
this is the

4315.44 --> 4321.5199999999995
this is the options we're presenting

4318.56 --> 4325.84
these are the options and it was like

4321.52 --> 4325.84
holy [ __ ] this [ __ ] world man

4326.159 --> 4332.32
the world to me just wanted to

4330.0 --> 4334.159
fool me into getting dragged into

4332.32 --> 4338.5599999999995
something

4334.159 --> 4340.879999999999
and then wasting all my talents

4338.56 --> 4343.1990000000005
they wanted me to waste all my talents

4340.88 --> 4346.159000000001
on something that's useless

4343.199 --> 4346.159
just to get by

4347.36 --> 4354.719
that's that's their primary trick

4350.719 --> 4357.52
that's how the satanists keep control

4354.719 --> 4360.56
by presenting you something that's kind

4357.52 --> 4363.679
of appealing at the start

4360.56 --> 4366.96
seems to give you authority power some

4363.679 --> 4370.2390000000005
respect but you don't realize that

4366.96 --> 4372.32
as you go through it all at the end

4370.239 --> 4374.48
you'll hate everything you originally

4372.32 --> 4377.12
liked about it everything will be just

4374.48 --> 4379.36
[ __ ] and a burden and it will be a drag

4377.12 --> 4381.5199999999995
and then you'll be held accountable

4379.36 --> 4383.36
you will be forced to keep on doing it

4381.52 --> 4384.0
because of your entanglements and the

4383.36 --> 4386.08
other people

4384.0 --> 4387.44
doing the same thing so it's going to be

4386.08 --> 4389.12
like crabs in a bucket

4387.44 --> 4390.639999999999
in the end it's everything you

4389.12 --> 4391.5199999999995
originally thought about it that was

4390.64 --> 4394.2390000000005
going to be good

4391.52 --> 4395.679
it's all going to be 180 degrees it's

4394.239 --> 4397.44
all going to suck

4395.679 --> 4399.36
it's all going to suck your life out of

4397.44 --> 4401.599999999999
you and you're gonna be

4399.36 --> 4403.679
spending the rest of your days and

4401.6 --> 4406.8
you're all telling yourself it was worth

4403.679 --> 4409.52
it yeah yeah i did something good

4406.8 --> 4409.52
really did you

4411.12 --> 4414.64
so yeah sorry this may be a bit over

4413.36 --> 4416.32
generalization

4414.64 --> 4418.56
but that's the situation i was

4416.32 --> 4423.36
confronted with

4418.56 --> 4423.360000000001
very young was like around 13

4424.64 --> 4428.4800000000005
that i really started to see that

4427.04 --> 4432.159
science

4428.48 --> 4434.718999999999
as as being utilized

4432.159 --> 4436.719
the scientific community the where the

4434.719 --> 4439.92
money flows where the reachers

4436.719 --> 4440.96
where the researchers are what is being

4439.92 --> 4444.8
taught that it is

4440.96 --> 4447.12
utterly corrupted fundamentally

4444.8 --> 4451.4400000000005
corrupted only held together

4447.12 --> 4453.04
just to trick people that it is

4451.44 --> 4454.639999999999
the truth and that they can trust it

4453.04 --> 4458.0
that they can trust the people that

4454.64 --> 4459.92
have this knowledge and then when you

4458.0 --> 4461.6
attain this knowledge you

4459.92 --> 4463.84
will be dragged into the circles and

4461.6 --> 4464.64
shown like we are here to mind control

4463.84 --> 4466.719
the people

4464.64 --> 4468.0
with this knowledge are you going to

4466.719 --> 4470.64
join us we all have a lot

4468.0 --> 4471.76
of power and you can mind control the

4470.64 --> 4474.56
people as well

4471.76 --> 4475.76
and then unfortunately for some freaking

4474.56 --> 4479.4400000000005
reason

4475.76 --> 4483.1990000000005
a big majority

4479.44 --> 4484.08
says yes to that [ __ ] or they start out

4483.199 --> 4485.919999999999
saying yes

4484.08 --> 4488.88
and then maybe they'll backtrack but

4485.92 --> 4488.88
they're still stuck

4495.84 --> 4511.84
i don't want that i want knowledge

4500.32 --> 4511.84
to really be real and honest

4512.32 --> 4516.32
and i'm also by that going through the

4514.719 --> 4519.92
philosophy

4516.32 --> 4523.04
that open knowledge

4519.92 --> 4528.32
cannot truly

4523.04 --> 4532.48
be used for bad if it's all pure

4528.32 --> 4533.5199999999995
like like even if the darkness would try

4532.48 --> 4536.879999999999
to try to

4533.52 --> 4537.76
and twist it abuse it use it as a mask

4536.88 --> 4540.96
in some way

4537.76 --> 4543.679
it's only going to pile on more sin that

4540.96 --> 4547.52
will be more visible

4543.679 --> 4548.08
so by that philosophy i really believe

4547.52 --> 4551.120000000001
in this

4548.08 --> 4553.199
method in doing it like this in

4551.12 --> 4555.36
dispelling the notion

4553.199 --> 4556.879999999999
that lies should be put out there for

4555.36 --> 4558.719
the general public

4556.88 --> 4561.679
because they cannot be trusted with the

4558.719 --> 4561.679
real information

4564.4 --> 4569.44
and thereby you base that on a

4567.36 --> 4572.96
pre-assumption that

4569.44 --> 4574.08
people in general will not make the

4572.96 --> 4580.32
right decisions

4574.08 --> 4582.239
when confronted with open knowledge

4580.32 --> 4583.679
that's an assumption because where's the

4582.239 --> 4585.839999999999
proof for that

4583.679 --> 4587.84
you know when people are confronted with

4585.84 --> 4590.56
a lot of false knowledge

4587.84 --> 4593.76
then they eventually will start to focus

4590.56 --> 4594.56
more on control within the story system

4593.76 --> 4596.96
or

4594.56 --> 4599.360000000001
respect authority virtue signaling

4596.96 --> 4601.679
that's what happens

4599.36 --> 4603.199
when they're confronted with false

4601.679 --> 4606.84
knowledge as real this

4603.199 --> 4608.879999999999
naturally happens naturally

4606.84 --> 4609.84
happens right but when they're

4608.88 --> 4613.4400000000005
confronted with

4609.84 --> 4613.92
real true knowledge confirmed honest and

4613.44 --> 4616.96
open

4613.92 --> 4618.88
driven by an open honest spirit that

4616.96 --> 4621.04
doesn't happen like that

4618.88 --> 4622.2390000000005
they have dark intentions they'll

4621.04 --> 4625.92
typically drip

4622.239 --> 4631.199
away they'll step away

4625.92 --> 4631.1990000000005
they're not going to get in there

4631.36 --> 4634.5599999999995
and then use it for something dark

4634.0 --> 4638.159
because

4634.56 --> 4641.679
it's visible to people

4638.159 --> 4644.0
that carry that open spirit of knowledge

4641.679 --> 4646.159
it's visible you can see it when you got

4644.0 --> 4651.84
the doors open you can see if other

4646.159 --> 4651.839999999999
people have their doors open or not

4655.76 --> 4660.400000000001
that's kind of a funny metaphor but yet

4658.719 --> 4663.44
if you got your door open

4660.4 --> 4665.28
you can look through it and see in other

4663.44 --> 4666.96
houses if they have their doors open if

4665.28 --> 4668.8
you've got your door closed

4666.96 --> 4670.4
now assuming you're not having windows

4668.8 --> 4673.52
around it yet you can't see if the

4670.4 --> 4673.5199999999995
others have the doors open

4674.48 --> 4681.599999999999
and that's how honest and open

4678.08 --> 4683.199
truthful insight works

4681.6 --> 4685.92
and i'm not talking about all the just

4683.199 --> 4686.32
so stories and ideas that are reified

4685.92 --> 4689.36
into

4686.32 --> 4691.28
absolute reality in between all that

4689.36 --> 4693.12
because yeah figuring out the truth is

4691.28 --> 4696.239
pretty much an experimental

4693.12 --> 4697.199
task you're constantly trying to figure

4696.239 --> 4700.5599999999995
things out

4697.199 --> 4703.839999999999
envision new methods to figure out

4700.56 --> 4706.080000000001
where you can go you know

4703.84 --> 4708.56
and if you then start to reify certain

4706.08 --> 4710.239
concepts into absolute reality and then

4708.56 --> 4714.0
going with that

4710.239 --> 4715.04
yeah it's going to be less truthful and

4714.0 --> 4719.28
more about oh

4715.04 --> 4721.84
this story this story

4719.28 --> 4721.84
right

4725.76 --> 4728.159000000001
anyway

4734.239 --> 4740.5599999999995
yeah tracy cole am i writing a book

4737.36 --> 4740.5599999999995
well sort of

4742.239 --> 4748.44
i got two pages so far it's basically i

4745.52 --> 4751.280000000001
wanted to write a book purely about

4748.44 --> 4752.799999999999
presuppositional based cosmogeny

4751.28 --> 4756.159
modeling

4752.8 --> 4758.64
just about the technical sides of

4756.159 --> 4760.839999999999
first and foremost to simply reveal that

4758.64 --> 4762.4800000000005
there are so many mechanical

4760.84 --> 4764.96
possibilities

4762.48 --> 4768.159
that's what i really wanted to put down

4764.96 --> 4768.159
structurally on paper

4771.28 --> 4775.12
but yeah i'm so used to just saying it

4774.56 --> 4777.120000000001
to just

4775.12 --> 4778.88
explaining it spontaneously on the spot

4777.12 --> 4780.08
as i'm doing on this show even and

4778.88 --> 4784.32
yesterday and

4780.08 --> 4787.36
every day just explain it on the spot

4784.32 --> 4789.44
and it is consistent i'd like you to

4787.36 --> 4792.4
test me on that

4789.44 --> 4793.28
you know every time i talk about this

4792.4 --> 4795.839999999999
you'll find

4793.28 --> 4796.96
it's all consistent and the only way

4795.84 --> 4801.6
things even change

4796.96 --> 4805.44
is by literal expansion

4801.6 --> 4808.96
consistent expansion like a tree

4805.44 --> 4813.759999999999
like a plant just new things on top

4808.96 --> 4813.76
and it stands the old part stands

4816.84 --> 4819.84
so

4829.44 --> 4833.678999999999
no i don't want to talk about it again

4831.28 --> 4835.599999999999
please

4833.679 --> 4837.76
the situation hasn't changed my

4835.6 --> 4839.1990000000005
roommate's still sick and coughing and

4837.76 --> 4843.6
[ __ ]

4839.199 --> 4845.599999999999
and i feel that there is psychosomatic

4843.6 --> 4847.76
like i've probably been touched already

4845.6 --> 4849.120000000001
by it but i'm just not giving it a

4847.76 --> 4852.96
chance to really

4849.12 --> 4854.0
yeah make me sick i know how to fight

4852.96 --> 4856.88
that

4854.0 --> 4856.88
psychosomatics

4857.92 --> 4862.639
and yeah i'm having more issues just

4860.96 --> 4866.96
with my back

4862.639 --> 4866.96
than with my my breathing or anything

4870.159 --> 4876.239
and i got zinc vitamin c vitamin d3

4874.159 --> 4878.638999999999
it's backup supplements so i'll be

4876.239 --> 4878.638999999999
alright

4880.96 --> 4885.84
and all the tests are all useless

4886.32 --> 4889.84
all of them

4892.4 --> 4897.199
now more color i i'm not getting which

4900.84 --> 4903.84
question

4905.52 --> 4909.040000000001
right right yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i

4907.6 --> 4911.4400000000005
talked about it yesterday i don't want

4909.04 --> 4915.04
to get into all that please

4911.44 --> 4917.04
just so happy that i finally avoided it

4915.04 --> 4919.44
but yes the tests are all completely

4917.04 --> 4922.239
useless as admitted i i

4919.44 --> 4923.759999999999
had a special segment on my show

4922.239 --> 4925.5199999999995
yesterday talking about it

4923.76 --> 4931.84
i watched my show back yesterday by the

4925.52 --> 4931.84
way i thought it was pretty good

4935.44 --> 4959.839999999999
terpenes i won

4944.719 --> 4959.84
what does that mean george sanford

oldest remaining people

4980.48 --> 4985.5199999999995
because a lot of people have come and

4982.239 --> 4987.28
then they eventually kind of moved on

4985.52 --> 4990.400000000001
people that i still see around it like

4987.28 --> 4995.44
in the flat earth debates chat

4990.4 --> 4995.44
or around in other

4998.84 --> 5001.84
shows
