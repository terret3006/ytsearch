148.319 --> 151.599
bunch of looter gangs

152.64 --> 157.83999999999997
you're not even supposed to be here

all right

167.92 --> 172.07999999999998

170.319 --> 174.23899999999998

174.239 --> 177.59900000000002
i got so much bread

177.76 --> 180.39999999999998
saved up

181.2 --> 185.2
all right

183.519 --> 188.56
hello elise g

185.2 --> 191.28
first in chat m fisher from eden

188.56 --> 191.28
good to see you

191.44 --> 197.35999999999999
how are you all doing

194.4 --> 199.84
i'm doing pretty good

197.36 --> 199.84
i had a

200.159 --> 205.35999999999999
a bit of a late well not late

203.04 --> 207.44
later than yesterday didn't go to bed

205.36 --> 209.92000000000002
super early

207.44 --> 211.04
but still i got up kind of early i guess

209.92 --> 213.83999999999997
that

211.04 --> 216.959
i kind of switched rhythms

213.84 --> 218.879
when i did that two days ago

216.959 --> 221.84
so now i've just the more like i just

218.879 --> 225.2
woke up at 10 and it's like like oh i'm

221.84 --> 227.44
i can't sleep more and then i'm like uh

225.2 --> 230.79899999999998
my body's like no

227.44 --> 232.56
no you're gonna get up oh okay

230.799 --> 235.12
fine

232.56 --> 236.64000000000001
so i did

235.12 --> 237.92000000000002
even though i've technically slept

236.64 --> 239.35999999999999
shorter

237.92 --> 241.76
but

239.36 --> 243.59900000000002
yeah i'm still feeling good

241.76 --> 245.599
i had a bit of a scare moment this

243.599 --> 248.159
morning because i thought that my my

245.599 --> 250.0
data disc had actually crashed i

248.159 --> 252.07999999999998
couldn't get it to start up was really

250.0 --> 254.0
weirded out by that

252.08 --> 257.35900000000004
took it out of my computer put it into

254.0 --> 259.12
the like the external

257.359 --> 260.88
uh

259.12 --> 262.96
hard disk thing

260.88 --> 264.479
like an external interface you can just

262.96 --> 266.63899999999995
plug it in there

264.479 --> 270.24
and then i got it to start up again so i

266.639 --> 272.479
was just like oh my god that's

270.24 --> 274.24
that was a close one

272.479 --> 276.32
i mean i could have still just i could

274.24 --> 278.40000000000003
still start up my computer because i got

276.32 --> 280.639
my stuff compartmentalized i got a

278.4 --> 284.23999999999995
startup disc everything installed on

280.639 --> 286.16
that and then the data disk

284.24 --> 289.68
so the data disk was i thought it had

286.16 --> 291.6
crashed but it hasn't thank god

289.68 --> 293.84000000000003
but it did make me think like i should

291.6 --> 298.32000000000005
probably like get a backup of like the

293.84 --> 300.79999999999995
really important files just to be safe

298.32 --> 302.8
and i called my dad

300.8 --> 306.16
because it just wanted to

302.8 --> 308.08
share me being relieved

306.16 --> 309.759
and he said he had a spare hard disk

308.08 --> 311.919
laying around so

309.759 --> 313.759
next opportunity

311.919 --> 318.4
you'll give it to me and i can just use

313.759 --> 318.40000000000003
it as a backup storage so that was nice

318.88 --> 322.8
feeling great this morning

320.56 --> 325.36
good good to hear that fisher from eden

322.8 --> 327.919
yeah i'm feeling a lot better than

325.36 --> 327.91900000000004
yesterday

328.96 --> 334.79999999999995
although yes i i did not feel bad i was

332.24 --> 336.16
just kind of like a little tense or

334.8 --> 338.479
something

336.16 --> 340.8
and yeah by the way i wasn't the only

338.479 --> 343.59999999999997
one oh my god guys

340.8 --> 345.68
remember that crazy troll

343.6 --> 347.759
went completely ape [ __ ] well that was

345.68 --> 349.68
on the flat earth debate as well

347.759 --> 352.24
and it seemed like it was everywhere so

349.68 --> 354.56
yesterday was like

352.24 --> 356.72
yesterday the trolls

354.56 --> 359.36
awoke

356.72 --> 362.0
for some reason not just here not just

359.36 --> 364.40000000000003
at fed but like in a lot of places there

362.0 --> 367.759
was just sudden

364.4 --> 369.12
troll outbursts all over the internet i

367.759 --> 371.52000000000004
think

369.12 --> 372.72
in enough places for me to say all over

371.52 --> 375.35999999999996
the internet

372.72 --> 378.639
it's really weird like like all of the

375.36 --> 380.47900000000004
typical troll people just suddenly go

378.639 --> 382.24
out of nowhere all at once because it's

380.479 --> 384.96
not one person

382.24 --> 384.96000000000004
that's weird

388.4 --> 394.31899999999996
yeah there was some energy going around

389.759 --> 397.28000000000003
for sure indeed it was rigged back

394.319 --> 400.08000000000004
but i feel better

397.28 --> 404.479
also i actively prayed

400.08 --> 404.479
well prayed i projected

404.56 --> 409.28000000000003
a vision onto the future

407.199 --> 410.72
for today

409.28 --> 412.55999999999995
it is kind of

410.72 --> 414.8
in the same train of thought as prayer

412.56 --> 416.8
except it's not really like all and then

414.8 --> 419.039
chant or something but

416.8 --> 421.919
just really like

419.039 --> 424.88
look taking the moment before sleep like

421.919 --> 427.12
looking into the future and then like

424.88 --> 430.0
pushing a little in a way

427.12 --> 431.84000000000003
like tomorrow is gonna be a restored day

430.0 --> 435.44
it's gonna be better

431.84 --> 435.44
i'm gonna be more under control

435.52 --> 440.639
and i'm not going to forget

438.16 --> 443.03900000000004
right that's one thing that i really

440.639 --> 445.199
projected onto it like i'm not going to

443.039 --> 448.0
forget i'm not going to get like

445.199 --> 449.599
oh i need a half hour to wake up no i

448.0 --> 451.68
was just

449.599 --> 453.44
focusing like no i'm going to remember

451.68 --> 456.479
and it worked

453.44 --> 459.44
it was interesting and funnily enough

456.479 --> 459.44
on youtube

460.479 --> 464.87899999999996
howdy machowski that did a little video

464.08 --> 467.039
about

464.879 --> 468.96000000000004
prayer

467.039 --> 471.36
this morning

468.96 --> 474.31899999999996
so it was just synchronicities there

471.36 --> 474.319
very interesting

474.96 --> 480.96
so from a more rowdy chaotic trollish

478.8 --> 483.44
day yesterday

480.96 --> 486.0
that energy it's now much more focused

483.44 --> 487.28
and serene

486.0 --> 490.56
much better

487.28 --> 490.55999999999995
i feel much stronger

491.52 --> 497.919
also yeah a weird thing i'm i have i

495.12 --> 499.52
consciously didn't take vitamin d and k2

497.919 --> 501.44
today

499.52 --> 503.75899999999996
because my healer told me something

501.44 --> 505.919
about that that was really weird that i

503.759 --> 508.47900000000004
hadn't expected it was about basically

505.919 --> 510.4
energy body

508.479 --> 512.639
and apparently

510.4 --> 512.639
like

513.919 --> 520.159
there's a weird energy energy effect in

516.959 --> 522.959
association with it with vitamin d in

520.159 --> 526.0
general he said even

522.959 --> 527.76
that it it's really helpful if you have

526.0 --> 529.519
a heavy

527.76 --> 533.2
conflict

529.519 --> 535.279
like a spiritual conflict of self-worth

533.2 --> 537.44
which is interesting because typical

535.279 --> 539.4399999999999
self-worth conflict or

537.44 --> 542.0
impulses of that nature

539.44 --> 542.72
might typically cause people that have

542.0 --> 545.6
it

542.72 --> 549.279
to basically hide from the sunlight to

545.6 --> 552.88
get sit in their basement and hide right

549.279 --> 556.16
and apparently for that it works great

552.88 --> 558.08
but if you don't have that or if you're

556.16 --> 559.68
like almost out of it then it can

558.08 --> 563.839
actually

559.68 --> 563.8389999999999
close you off weirdly enough

564.16 --> 569.12
so this is all spiritual and he told me

566.56 --> 571.279
that and i was like hmm

569.12 --> 572.24
that's really odd

571.279 --> 574.32
because

572.24 --> 578.64
i've been taking

574.32 --> 581.2
d3 for quite a while now like years

578.64 --> 582.48
and i have memories alongside those

581.2 --> 584.6400000000001
years that

582.48 --> 589.8000000000001
during that entire period

584.64 --> 589.8
i had a lot of like rage outbursts

590.72 --> 596.399
like that i didn't have before

593.519 --> 598.8
so i'm now going to test this piece of

596.399 --> 600.56
new knowledge from my healer that's

598.8 --> 601.92
purely spiritual

600.56 --> 605.8389999999999
to see

601.92 --> 605.8389999999999
if they'll go away if i stop taking him

608.959 --> 614.16
is a hormone not a vitamin okay rest

612.0 --> 616.56
that thanks for that info

614.16 --> 616.56
could be

616.959 --> 620.56
right

619.12 --> 621.519
so

620.56 --> 625.3599999999999
right

621.519 --> 627.76
anyway the spring time is kind of coming

625.36 --> 627.76
and

628.88 --> 633.2
so i'm just gonna not take it for a

630.88 --> 635.36
while i still have dude i have so much

633.2 --> 637.12
stock off item and day three it's kind

635.36 --> 639.2
of weird i

637.12 --> 641.04
seem to have stocked up on it i

639.2 --> 643.519
technically i could take it every day

641.04 --> 643.519
for like

643.6 --> 648.64
is it three more three months four

646.32 --> 648.6400000000001
months

649.44 --> 653.9200000000001
but i'm not going to take it right now

652.16 --> 655.1999999999999
it's just kind of weird

653.92 --> 657.4399999999999
it's a bit

655.2 --> 660.44
feel a bit silly that i have it but oh

657.44 --> 660.44
well

661.76 --> 666.88
i'm gonna test out whether there is a

664.32 --> 668.32
direct correlation or maybe causation

666.88 --> 671.76
with

668.32 --> 673.519
some of my sudden mood bursts

671.76 --> 675.279
with it because it's supposed to like

673.519 --> 677.12
close you off

675.279 --> 678.56
when you close off

677.12 --> 680.88
it's like

678.56 --> 684.16
the law of hate formula right i always

680.88 --> 686.72
said hatred is actually love unanswered

684.16 --> 690.0
well what is love love is a connection

686.72 --> 692.48
and a flow so if that's closed off it

690.0 --> 695.04
almost automatically

692.48 --> 697.36
would have a tendency to become hate

695.04 --> 699.4399999999999
once you try to connect and do that

697.36 --> 700.839
which is something i do because i'm an

699.44 --> 702.5600000000001
empath

700.839 --> 706.6400000000001
right

702.56 --> 710.16
so there's actually a logic behind this

706.64 --> 710.16
test that i'm gonna do

713.839 --> 718.48
you have to cycle off it periodically

715.92 --> 718.4799999999999
interesting

718.72 --> 723.44
did i notice how calm nathan was yeah he

720.8 --> 725.92
was unusually calm

723.44 --> 729.2
but maybe he already saw it coming i

725.92 --> 731.36
mean he was there on my show he did pop

729.2 --> 733.6800000000001
up in my chat

731.36 --> 736.48
so maybe he just saw it like oh our

733.68 --> 738.079
wind's all super fired up that means

736.48 --> 739.76
there's going to be tro the trolls were

738.079 --> 742.959
going crazy was probably seeing that so

739.76 --> 746.3199999999999
he's like okay i'm gonna set myself to

742.959 --> 747.68
super super calm reserve nathan mode

746.32 --> 749.12
because that's probably going to work

747.68 --> 751.1999999999999
really well

749.12 --> 753.6
and it did

751.2 --> 755.519
very unusual well i think it was just

753.6 --> 759.36
strategic

755.519 --> 760.9590000000001
yes it was impressive i agree

759.36 --> 762.88
maybe it's the goatee maybe it's just

760.959 --> 765.1999999999999
getting some beard power or something i

762.88 --> 765.2
don't know

768.72 --> 773.0400000000001
but yeah

771.04 --> 777.4399999999999
yeah yesterday's flat earth debate was

773.04 --> 777.4399999999999
very good it was very interesting

782.399 --> 787.04
yeah he was super triggered man he

784.32 --> 790.48
dropped the f-bomb so many times it was

787.04 --> 790.48
it reminded me of that time

790.56 --> 795.4399999999999
like an interview i heard very long ago

793.279 --> 798.32
now it's like five years

795.44 --> 800.1600000000001
mark sergeant had some caller on on some

798.32 --> 804.0790000000001
radio show and the caller was like just

800.16 --> 807.6
[ __ ] you sort of a [ __ ] you're a liar

804.079 --> 810.6389999999999
was so [ __ ] pissed off

807.6 --> 813.0400000000001
and marcus like okay okay

810.639 --> 816.5600000000001
it's all right i understand

813.04 --> 819.1999999999999
it kind of reminded me of that

816.56 --> 819.1999999999999
pain meds

820.72 --> 826.48
i don't know

822.639 --> 826.48
i don't know if it was that rest ahead

826.72 --> 832.1600000000001
it might be

829.12 --> 834.639
i didn't really notice that though

832.16 --> 836.8
pain meds usually have like an influence

834.639 --> 836.8
on

837.04 --> 840.4399999999999
on your output

844.88 --> 849.76
right

846.079 --> 849.76
hey slow mo moon buggy good to see you

851.12 --> 855.44
but we also uh who else is here

855.76 --> 860.639
seeking star wars

857.92 --> 860.639
good to see you

867.36 --> 870.36
right

872.56 --> 875.92
anyway so yeah

877.68 --> 883.04
spiritual stuff

879.44 --> 885.6
things that my healer brings on like

883.04 --> 887.36
that's it's like a whole other level

885.6 --> 890.16
guys like this

887.36 --> 891.1990000000001
he's basically doing spiritual mechanics

890.16 --> 892.48
and

891.199 --> 895.5999999999999
or what is it

892.48 --> 898.639
the influence of substances including

895.6 --> 900.48
food and things like supplements like on

898.639 --> 902.9590000000001
the body and there's been

900.48 --> 904.9590000000001
testing to this

902.959 --> 909.199
but it's completely different from the

904.959 --> 911.5189999999999
typical biological approach right

909.199 --> 913.3599999999999
so it almost surpasses even like

911.519 --> 916.32
alternative medicine

913.36 --> 918.24
it well almost it does it really does

916.32 --> 920.88
and it's really focused on the spirit

918.24 --> 920.88
mechanics

921.68 --> 924.2399999999999
the root of steiner is all about that as

923.44 --> 927.1990000000001
well

924.24 --> 929.44
so it's very interesting there's so much

927.199 --> 932.0
to learn

929.44 --> 934.72
and yeah my healer knows a lot about it

932.0 --> 936.32
i can't absorb that all at once but just

934.72 --> 937.839
getting these tips

936.32 --> 941.44
one at a time

937.839 --> 944.1600000000001
is really interesting for me

941.44 --> 947.2790000000001
and i'm yeah i feel it is

944.16 --> 950.24
like i don't take his

947.279 --> 953.04
his insights just for granted or like oh

950.24 --> 953.04
this is just some

953.44 --> 958.1600000000001
some nonsense no no no when he makes a

955.759 --> 960.72
point it's there's something to it

958.16 --> 962.639
there's always something to it

960.72 --> 965.279
he isn't always like perfectly correct

962.639 --> 967.279
because in a way like he uses the spirit

965.279 --> 970.079
and his guides to size things up and

967.279 --> 971.36
he's very good at it but not perfect you

970.079 --> 974.0
see

971.36 --> 976.639
still a human he still uses his

974.0 --> 979.519
consciousness to find his way through

976.639 --> 982.32
and he has his own personal

979.519 --> 985.04
little detail issues that are very

982.32 --> 987.279
elusive so he's super effective

985.04 --> 989.92
but he's not like

987.279 --> 992.24
like a perfect telepath like that

989.92 --> 995.12
but for most people they would think

992.24 --> 996.639
like what he does is like telepathic and

995.12 --> 999.36
in ways it is

996.639 --> 1001.6
kind of like the way things i do

999.36 --> 1004.639
are sort of

1001.6 --> 1006.88
sub telepathic like i i discussed this

1004.639 --> 1008.639
even with my dad over the phone a couple

1006.88 --> 1010.079
of times

1008.639 --> 1014.0
and i've discussed this here in this

1010.079 --> 1016.4799999999999
show too that sometimes i can just

1014.0 --> 1020.079
connect the people and then basically

1016.48 --> 1022.48
use the information that they have

1020.079 --> 1024.959
but they don't even necessarily have to

1022.48 --> 1027.3600000000001
be conscious about it

1024.959 --> 1029.679
it's like i can remember things they

1027.36 --> 1031.6789999999999
have forgotten or something

1029.679 --> 1034.959
to make it to put it down in one

1031.679 --> 1037.2800000000002
sentence it's not literally that

1034.959 --> 1038.88
but it is a telepathic effect it's

1037.28 --> 1040.72
really interesting how it works it's

1038.88 --> 1042.4
spirit communication there's just all

1040.72 --> 1043.679
these different levels that people

1042.4 --> 1046.4
communicate

1043.679 --> 1049.76
and the consciousness is really in just

1046.4 --> 1051.679
one part of a very big platter of things

1049.76 --> 1054.16
that are happening really all that's all

1051.679 --> 1054.16
at once

1059.36 --> 1065.12
all right

1061.44 --> 1065.1200000000001
hey ralph rodriguez good to see you

1065.44 --> 1068.16
adam price

1075.36 --> 1078.36
hmm

1080.88 --> 1085.3600000000001
you had a what

1082.799 --> 1085.36
what is that

1086.16 --> 1092.1200000000001
is that a tangerine or an orange i don't

1089.12 --> 1092.12
know

1098.64 --> 1101.3600000000001
right anyway

1104.4 --> 1110.24
yeah yesterday an orange what you you

1107.2 --> 1112.559
ate the orange with the peel

1110.24 --> 1112.559
what

1114.64 --> 1117.64
why

1125.12 --> 1130.1599999999999
oh freeze dryer oh

1127.44 --> 1133.88
okay that's cool sticking star water

1130.16 --> 1133.88
so it's very interesting

1142.799 --> 1146.6399999999999
yes exactly what

1147.44 --> 1152.48
what why why would you eat it with the

1150.08 --> 1152.48
peel

1156.48 --> 1163.2
i mean i guess like orange peel is

1159.44 --> 1166.0800000000002
has disinfectant qualities

1163.2 --> 1166.0800000000002
but yeah

1171.919 --> 1176.5590000000002
i mean other than like shavings for i

1174.72 --> 1179.52
don't know certain types of dessert or

1176.559 --> 1180.32
something i've seen people do that

1179.52 --> 1184.4
i

1180.32 --> 1184.3999999999999
like eating the whole peel what

1185.679 --> 1190.88
i mean the white parts right the not the

1188.72 --> 1192.48
orange part but what's usually kind of

1190.88 --> 1195.8400000000001
left on top of it

1192.48 --> 1195.84
it's not bad to eat that

1198.16 --> 1202.76
but like the orange part what

1210.4 --> 1213.3600000000001
high

1211.799 --> 1216.4
lemonine

1213.36 --> 1218.3999999999999
terpenes yeah

1216.4 --> 1221.039
right it has a function you can actually

1218.4 --> 1224.3200000000002
eat it but to just like literally eat

1221.039 --> 1228.0
the whole orange with peel what

1224.32 --> 1228.0
that seems a bit over the top

1232.24 --> 1237.6
blue mold oh no orange peels and what

1236.159 --> 1240.5590000000002
okay

1237.6 --> 1244.8799999999999
okay slow mo i didn't know that that's

1240.559 --> 1247.8799999999999
interesting is it always antabaya is

1244.88 --> 1247.88
huh

1249.36 --> 1254.6399999999999
okay that that could be a very

1251.52 --> 1258.679
interesting little detail to remember

1254.64 --> 1258.679
i never heard that one before

1264.96 --> 1269.6000000000001
if it's a supermarket what chemicals are

1268.24 --> 1271.76
on it

1269.6 --> 1272.6399999999999
why andy hold my beer i wouldn't know

1271.76 --> 1276.0
because

1272.64 --> 1278.72
i only go to like organic grocery stores

1276.0 --> 1280.32
pretty sure they don't spray

1278.72 --> 1282.559
[ __ ] on there but yeah if you're going

1280.32 --> 1284.96
to eat the peel of an orange yet you

1282.559 --> 1289.32
might want to wash it first that

1284.96 --> 1289.32
wouldn't be a bad idea anyhow

1295.52 --> 1299.52
you can send a link link of what

1302.96 --> 1306.64
it must be nice

1305.28 --> 1308.799
right well

1306.64 --> 1312.0800000000002
and he hold my bear yeah to be fair i

1308.799 --> 1314.32
don't really eat a lot of fruit

1312.08 --> 1316.48
i mean sometimes i'm really in the boot

1314.32 --> 1317.9189999999999
for it then it's like like especially if

1316.48 --> 1320.4
i've been sick or something then it's

1317.919 --> 1323.1200000000001
like i need i need it but it's usually

1320.4 --> 1323.1200000000001
just one day

1324.48 --> 1328.64
maybe two and then i'm kind of done

1326.799 --> 1330.8799999999999
i eat more fruit in the springtime

1328.64 --> 1330.88
though

1331.36 --> 1337.36
think of the blue mold and table okay

1333.28 --> 1337.36
sure slow mo moon buggy why not

1339.84 --> 1343.039
but i think i can just remember it

1342.08 --> 1344.72
though

1343.039 --> 1345.76
i think that's if you

1344.72 --> 1347.84
search

1345.76 --> 1350.48
on blue mold antibiotic you'll probably

1347.84 --> 1353.1999999999998
find a whole bunch of

1350.48 --> 1353.2
websites

1353.84 --> 1358.6399999999999
you love blueberries don't you yeah i

1356.08 --> 1361.84
did i had a phase where i really liked

1358.64 --> 1361.8400000000001
that that's true

1364.48 --> 1367.76
right but there

1365.76 --> 1368.96
but it's more like for in the middle of

1367.76 --> 1370.4
summer

1368.96 --> 1372.159
right

1370.4 --> 1374.88
because when it's hot here then it's

1372.159 --> 1377.7600000000002
kind of nice having

1374.88 --> 1380.5590000000002
like refreshing fruits

1377.76 --> 1380.559
that kind of thing

1381.039 --> 1388.8799999999999
but i haven't had any in a long time

1384.72 --> 1390.48
like at least over half a year

1388.88 --> 1393.6000000000001
because yeah i don't really have the

1390.48 --> 1393.6
money for it right now

1396.24 --> 1400.0
you could try to do something about that

1398.559 --> 1402.72
though and

1400.0 --> 1404.159
donate to my paypal and then

1402.72 --> 1407.28
i don't know if you have a special

1404.159 --> 1408.88
request like get this

1407.28 --> 1410.32
and it's been done before like people

1408.88 --> 1412.24
would insist like i'm giving you a

1410.32 --> 1414.32
paypal so you got you get that

1412.24 --> 1416.4
illuminati croissant right i had a whole

1414.32 --> 1418.24
illuminati croissant face and people

1416.4 --> 1420.159
would just donate specifically for

1418.24 --> 1421.679
illuminati croissant and then yeah okay

1420.159 --> 1423.919
i'll do it

1421.679 --> 1423.919
right

1427.12 --> 1429.6
but

1427.919 --> 1430.48
yeah

1429.6 --> 1433.84
anyway

1430.48 --> 1436.159
any opportunity to plug

1433.84 --> 1438.8799999999999
for donations i'm gonna take because i

1436.159 --> 1441.88
need it i really do

1438.88 --> 1441.88

1444.08 --> 1446.3999999999999
dart

1451.039 --> 1455.559
don't make trouble now you're here

1458.6 --> 1464.24
asmr blueberry eating live

1462.88 --> 1469.3200000000002
what

1464.24 --> 1469.32
keep forgetting what is that asmr about

1488.24 --> 1493.1200000000001
autonomous sensory meridian response

1498.48 --> 1501.48
what

1506.64 --> 1511.1200000000001
is that another word for just triggering

1512.88 --> 1520.24
positive triggering low-grade euphoria

1516.96 --> 1522.72
wow it makes people euphoric

1520.24 --> 1522.72
really

1523.84 --> 1526.84
okay

as i humanly can

1548.72 --> 1553.84
if i [ __ ] feel like it troll

1552.799 --> 1555.6
yeah

1553.84 --> 1557.84
there's nothing you can do about it

1555.6 --> 1557.84
nothing

1558.96 --> 1563.679
you understand you have no authority

1561.12 --> 1566.6399999999999
here you can't threaten me i know what

1563.679 --> 1568.88
i'm doing you can't threaten me people

1581.919 --> 1587.679
i'm not even going to be altered you're

1584.32 --> 1591.76
not even a pebble

1587.679 --> 1594.5590000000002
to cause a ripple in my stream okay

1591.76 --> 1594.559
good luck with that

1597.76 --> 1604.559
six million sounds a bit high oh indeed

1601.84 --> 1607.279
it's preposterous

1604.559 --> 1608.48
right but hey i'm not gonna deny that

1607.279 --> 1611.2
there were

1608.48 --> 1611.2
jews like

1611.6 --> 1615.36
yeah

1612.799 --> 1617.36
like really abused and including even

1615.36 --> 1618.7199999999998
abuse for their intellect which i think

1617.36 --> 1621.6
is

1618.72 --> 1623.76
is even more offensive that like smart

1621.6 --> 1625.36
jews had been

1623.76 --> 1628.24
basically

1625.36 --> 1630.9599999999998
abused to help with stuff and then just

1628.24 --> 1635.1200000000001
killed like abuse their intellect that's

1630.96 --> 1635.1200000000001
even more egregious in my opinion

1636.64 --> 1641.8400000000001
[ __ ] you i don't live in germany [ __ ]

1641.919 --> 1647.2

1667.919 --> 1670.48
that

1669.2 --> 1672.72
whatever's

1670.48 --> 1674.32
right now calling themselves jews out

1672.72 --> 1676.0
there they're not really they have

1674.32 --> 1678.08
nothing to do

1676.0 --> 1681.12
with that at all it's just that people

1678.08 --> 1683.12
identifying themselves as jews they have

1681.12 --> 1685.6789999999999
nothing to do with it

1683.12 --> 1688.4799999999998
it's ridiculous

1685.679 --> 1692.88
yeah and i recognize that

1688.48 --> 1696.96
right those jews are satanists

1692.88 --> 1700.159
which is exactly the opposite of a jew

1696.96 --> 1701.1200000000001
which is the point of it

1700.159 --> 1704.5590000000002
yeah

1701.12 --> 1704.559
that's what a satanist does

1709.52 --> 1713.279
gypsy community dead oh yeah

1713.679 --> 1719.2

1731.84 --> 1738.76
when you sat down on that couch

1734.88 --> 1738.7600000000002
after that game of dart

1747.44 --> 1751.039
they were romani the jibs dude there was

1749.52 --> 1753.44
all kinds of things

1751.039 --> 1755.679
going on there

1753.44 --> 1756.559
i mean germany at the time was a giant

1755.679 --> 1757.76
mess

1756.559 --> 1760.32
it had been

1757.76 --> 1760.32

1760.88 --> 1766.0
right they lost a war they got a giant

1763.919 --> 1767.679
treaty of versailles that absolutely

1766.0 --> 1769.6
screwed them over

1767.679 --> 1771.919
it was a giant mess and when a country

1769.6 --> 1773.9189999999999
is a giant mess

1771.919 --> 1775.8400000000001
predatory groups

1773.919 --> 1778.96
people that really don't respect the

1778.96 --> 1785.679
it's what they do

1781.76 --> 1785.679
right and that includes gypsies right

1788.0 --> 1793.2
yeah that's what they do

1790.24 --> 1795.679
and then it went completely out of hand

1793.2 --> 1797.44
everything went out of hand and

1795.679 --> 1800.48
hitler was

1797.44 --> 1802.88
a raving maniac he was a graveler

1800.48 --> 1805.919

2326.8 --> 2329.8390000000004
right before the show

2331.599 --> 2337.76
right and i need to because i have

2333.92 --> 2341.28
issues in the sense that old fillings

2337.76 --> 2342.88
like from over 20 years ago

2341.28 --> 2345.0400000000004
much like

2342.88 --> 2347.6800000000003
30 years ago

2345.04 --> 2349.52
that are kind of yeah

2347.68 --> 2351.52
breaking off and all that

2349.52 --> 2355.839
sent you five bucks ah thank you nathan

2351.52 --> 2358.4
i really appreciate that yeah

2355.839 --> 2358.4
thank you

2362.64 --> 2367.48
floss after every meal yeah if necessary

2369.119 --> 2372.96
so yeah

2370.4 --> 2373.839
i actually take really good care of my

2372.96 --> 2376.8
teeth

2373.839 --> 2379.599
considering the circumstances

2376.8 --> 2383.0
don't use fluoride

2379.599 --> 2383.0
very careful

2401.68 --> 2404.68
so

2412.8 --> 2418.7200000000003
don't be like nathan i try to watch the

2415.2 --> 2421.359
ads it isn't worth watching the ads on

2418.72 --> 2423.359
youtube shorts well all my ads are

2421.359 --> 2426.0789999999997
always short though

2423.359 --> 2428.319
i specifically

2426.079 --> 2430.48
like disabled like

2428.319 --> 2432.56
ads that you can't click away

2430.48 --> 2435.839
right so none of my ads are going to be

2432.56 --> 2435.839
longer than five seconds

2436.96 --> 2442.8
i guess it's still annoying but on the

2439.04 --> 2442.8
same note right it is

2443.2 --> 2448.72
worth it because there is a i going down

2446.72 --> 2451.5989999999997
with these ads and

2448.72 --> 2454.16
if yeah to actually watch keep track of

2451.599 --> 2456.56
what the ads are doing is to keep track

2454.16 --> 2459.04
of what the ai is doing and how you are

2456.56 --> 2460.96
sized up right

2459.04 --> 2463.359
because ads

2460.96 --> 2467.319
from the google ai is almost like

2463.359 --> 2467.319
another form of communication

2467.68 --> 2474.24
because the system is constantly sizing

2469.92 --> 2476.8
you up and the ads reveal to you how

2474.24 --> 2479.1189999999997
and i actually find that

2476.8 --> 2480.88
worthy enough to keep them around

2479.119 --> 2485.119
as long as you don't have to sit through

2480.88 --> 2487.2000000000003
like 30 seconds of some alcohol and crap

2485.119 --> 2489.92
i hate those

2487.2 --> 2489.9199999999996
disgusting

2492.079 --> 2497.7200000000003
can't find toothpaste without there's

2493.839 --> 2497.72
plenty around still

2511.68 --> 2515.5989999999997
three minutes forced commercials every

2513.76 --> 2519.28
seven minutes

2515.599 --> 2519.28
damn that's a lot

2520.16 --> 2525.359
by the way that's kind of weird that you

2521.839 --> 2527.7599999999998
mentioned it because i was watching

2525.359 --> 2531.04
show from two days ago

2527.76 --> 2533.2000000000003
i did that yesterday by the way

2531.04 --> 2534.72
before the show

2533.2 --> 2539.68
and

2534.72 --> 2542.7999999999997
i got a lot of ads like i was watching

2539.68 --> 2544.24
i had watched half which was an hour

2542.8 --> 2547.119
and i had like

2544.24 --> 2549.2799999999997
eight or nine ads

2547.119 --> 2552.2400000000002
i was like dude what the [ __ ]

2549.28 --> 2553.52
like really that many ads on my little

2552.24 --> 2555.7599999999998
show

2553.52 --> 2557.44
like really

2555.76 --> 2559.8390000000004
that many

2557.44 --> 2562.56
that was really surprising

2559.839 --> 2565.2799999999997
because i had very long periods like

2562.56 --> 2568.56
say two years ago where they didn't they

2565.28 --> 2570.4
just had one ad or none at all

2568.56 --> 2571.52
maybe i just wasn't interesting enough

2570.4 --> 2573.92
or something

2571.52 --> 2576.16
maybe the system sized me up as just not

2573.92 --> 2578.7200000000003
significant enough

2576.16 --> 2580.319
but apparently that's changed a lot

2578.72 --> 2582.3999999999996
apparently now i'm a lot more

2580.319 --> 2585.88
interesting because it likes to cram

2582.4 --> 2585.88
adds in there

2593.28 --> 2595.76
come on

2604.319 --> 2610.4
cable tvs and watching because of that

2608.079 --> 2613.92
dude

2610.4 --> 2616.88
yeah the ads are tvs no the ads aren't

2613.92 --> 2620.0
even a problem it's the freaking content

2616.88 --> 2620.8
that's the problem

2620.0 --> 2622.599
like

2620.8 --> 2625.44
every time now

2622.599 --> 2628.6400000000003
every single time now talk about dutch

2625.44 --> 2631.28
television every single time i what i

2628.64 --> 2632.0789999999997
try to watch anything

2631.28 --> 2635.2000000000003
it

2632.079 --> 2636.96
is almost a hundred percent guarantee

2635.2 --> 2638.64
that within a minute

2636.96 --> 2640.079
i have to turn it off because it's gonna

2638.64 --> 2641.52
make me vomit

2640.079 --> 2643.2000000000003
it's so

2641.52 --> 2647.04
bad

2643.2 --> 2649.04
the mind control the like the aggressive

2647.04 --> 2651.599
hyper leftist

2649.04 --> 2653.599
mind control it's not like communist war

2651.599 --> 2655.599
chanting just yet but it's like

2653.599 --> 2658.8
everything else

2655.599 --> 2662.6400000000003
it's so invasive it's all so

2658.8 --> 2665.28
mega pro everything that's wrong it's so

2662.64 --> 2669.04
political it's so polarized it's so

2665.28 --> 2672.4
everything is just unbearable now

2669.04 --> 2675.68
on dutch television it's unbearable

2672.4 --> 2677.44
it's [ __ ] up beyond repair

2675.68 --> 2680.0789999999997
the only thing left really to do is just

2677.44 --> 2683.56
scrap the whole thing just close down

2680.079 --> 2683.5600000000004
close it down

2694.72 --> 2699.5989999999997
thirty dollars for a 90 day subscription

2697.92 --> 2702.96
jesus

2699.599 --> 2702.96
talk about a rip off

2703.2 --> 2707.68
like you'd have to almost be virtue

2705.28 --> 2710.4
signaling to do that that's just that's

2707.68 --> 2712.16
just insane

2710.4 --> 2714.48
right and here by the way

2712.16 --> 2716.7999999999997
i don't even need that

2714.48 --> 2720.839
there's just you can access tv through

2716.8 --> 2720.8390000000004
the internet it's all free

2737.839 --> 2740.839
so

2750.72 --> 2756.0
okay fisher from eden hey if that's what

2753.28 --> 2756.0
you like to do

2756.56 --> 2764.16
i'm not going anywhere like to any kind

2760.48 --> 2764.16
of tv program not doing it

2765.599 --> 2768.7200000000003
youtube premium

2767.839 --> 2772.0789999999997
hmm

2768.72 --> 2774.24
it is well i constantly get like offers

2772.079 --> 2776.0
from youtube oh get get a month free

2774.24 --> 2778.319
premium get do it oh you can have a

2776.0 --> 2780.88
premium i'm like no no i just want to

2778.319 --> 2782.88
see it exactly as is

2780.88 --> 2786.319
because i want to see the ads i want to

2782.88 --> 2786.319
see what they're going to throw at me

2786.96 --> 2791.92
i mean i don't want to watch ads all the

2789.2 --> 2793.359
time but i kind of want to see how i'm

2791.92 --> 2796.48
sized up and what they're going to try

2793.359 --> 2800.0789999999997
to throw at me i want to know

2796.48 --> 2803.839
it's feedback to me

2800.079 --> 2803.8390000000004
you don't have to pay for youtube right

2805.92 --> 2810.7200000000003
but you have to pay for a youtube

2807.599 --> 2810.7200000000003
premium though i think

2815.119 --> 2819.52
why would you pay for premium i don't

2817.2 --> 2821.359
know there's probably benefits george

2819.52 --> 2823.04
stanford

2821.359 --> 2825.44
pretty sure that nathan

2823.04 --> 2827.2799999999997
pays for premium and i think there is

2825.44 --> 2828.7200000000003
benefits for it

2827.28 --> 2831.8390000000004
also for

2828.72 --> 2831.839
as a content creator

2831.92 --> 2840.2000000000003
but yeah and i'd have to ask him

2835.92 --> 2840.2000000000003
if it comes up i'll ask him

2850.4 --> 2853.4
so

2860.16 --> 2865.2799999999997
look yeah you can avoid ads if you

2863.359 --> 2867.44
insist on doing that i'm just saying

2865.28 --> 2871.52
there might actually be a slight

2867.44 --> 2871.52
advantage to having it around

2871.599 --> 2875.839
right i

2872.88 --> 2879.839
you could almost consider it

2875.839 --> 2880.64
kind of ironic as an inoculation

2879.839 --> 2882.72
like

2880.64 --> 2885.2799999999997
you take a bit of the poison you know

2882.72 --> 2887.2
what's coming at you and then if you

2885.28 --> 2889.0400000000004
suddenly are like forced to sit through

2887.2 --> 2890.96
it it's not going to be it's not going

2889.04 --> 2893.7599999999998
to make you physically ill because you

2890.96 --> 2895.04
kind of were inoculated against it

2893.76 --> 2898.0
see

2895.04 --> 2899.119
kind of i guess the same as like

2898.0 --> 2902.88
taking

2899.119 --> 2906.0
micro doses of cyanide

2902.88 --> 2909.52
so that you when you get an actual

2906.0 --> 2910.96
lethal dose it won't kill you

2909.52 --> 2912.319
right

2910.96 --> 2914.559
that's

2912.319 --> 2916.8
that's how i treat adds

2914.559 --> 2919.0400000000004
i know it's poison but

2916.8 --> 2922.48
i want to know what kind of poison and

2919.04 --> 2924.16
then yeah i'm not gonna get totally my

2922.48 --> 2926.839
day is not gonna be a ruin if i'm

2924.16 --> 2929.7599999999998
suddenly forced to sit through

2926.839 --> 2931.92
ads because i'm inoculated

2929.76 --> 2934.559
i'm already a bit used to how terrible

2931.92 --> 2934.559
they can be

2938.8 --> 2942.6400000000003
you hate them because they're in their

2939.92 --> 2944.48
native yeah with me too by the way i get

2942.64 --> 2946.319
dutch commercials too and they're like

2944.48 --> 2948.88
really repulsive

2946.319 --> 2950.96
because every freaking dutch person in a

2948.88 --> 2953.76
commercial

2950.96 --> 2956.559
like they're all just acting like

2953.76 --> 2959.599
complete retards they're all like

2956.559 --> 2959.599
like almost literally

2960.88 --> 2966.319
like that's the new normal everybody's a

2963.92 --> 2968.559
[ __ ] now it's like

2966.319 --> 2971.44
i just want to choke those guys when i

2968.559 --> 2974.96
see that like [ __ ] off you're a [ __ ]

2971.44 --> 2978.319
[ __ ] piss off it's not normal stop

2974.96 --> 2980.96
degenerating everybody you filthy

2978.319 --> 2980.96
grabbler

2982.24 --> 2986.9199999999996
but yeah

2983.44 --> 2986.92
can't be helped

2999.28 --> 3003.0400000000004
i play a little game during super bowl

3001.119 --> 3006.599
commercials can you spot the narrative

3003.04 --> 3006.599
yeah well for sure

3022.4 --> 3026.96
all right but to me like spot the

3024.24 --> 3028.4799999999996
narrative it's not even

3026.96 --> 3030.8
like

3028.48 --> 3032.559
i don't have to look out if i can see it

3030.8 --> 3035.28
it's always like oh

3032.559 --> 3038.559
because i i don't have to look to see it

3035.28 --> 3040.4
it just it's always immediate like oh

3038.559 --> 3043.2000000000003
god there we go again

3040.4 --> 3047.04
you don't have to look you just have to

3043.2 --> 3047.04
have it bump into your face and

3047.28 --> 3052.8
if you're not just a complete ignorant

3049.68 --> 3056.68
sheep you will know exactly what they're

3052.8 --> 3056.6800000000003
trying to do immediately

3061.5 --> 3064.69
[Music]

3070.72 --> 3076.3999999999996
right

3072.24 --> 3076.3999999999996
yeah they want to create an idiocracy

3076.48 --> 3081.2400000000002
right

3078.24 --> 3081.24
plutocracy

3083.04 --> 3088.48
an idiocracy

3084.8 --> 3089.92
it's like a plutocracy idiocracy

3088.48 --> 3092.16
mix

3089.92 --> 3094.4
i want everybody to be [ __ ] and they

3092.16 --> 3098.3999999999996
want the ones on top to be

3094.4 --> 3100.559
just maniacal murderous maniacs

3098.4 --> 3104.079
that's how they see the world maniacal

3100.559 --> 3107.44
murderous maniacs and [ __ ] retards

3104.079 --> 3110.88
that's how they want the world to be

3107.44 --> 3113.119
so you want to be a demon predator

3110.88 --> 3115.52
like a blatantly evil going to hell

3113.119 --> 3118.8
demon predator or you want to be

3115.52 --> 3120.48
like a completely useless idiot sheep

3118.8 --> 3122.88
that's going to get himself killed

3120.48 --> 3126.64
guaranteed which one do you want to be

3122.88 --> 3126.6400000000003
that's the offer they're making tea

3132.079 --> 3135.92
plutocracy idiocracy

3136.16 --> 3141.319
hey james mason crockett

3155.92 --> 3159.76
yeah fisher from fisher from eden no

3157.839 --> 3162.4
[ __ ] there's more black people in ads

3159.76 --> 3163.6800000000003
it's all black

3162.4 --> 3165.6800000000003
unless

3163.68 --> 3169.44
it's somebody acting like a complete

3165.68 --> 3169.44
[ __ ] and then they have to be white

3173.2 --> 3177.9199999999996
because if you're a white guy

3175.599 --> 3181.04
you can't be seen in ads

3177.92 --> 3182.2400000000002
having seemingly having some form of

3181.04 --> 3184.5589999999997
dignity

3182.24 --> 3184.5589999999997
right

3186.96 --> 3191.119
i mean metaphorically they almost

3188.88 --> 3193.2000000000003
literally just parade the white guys or

3191.119 --> 3196.2400000000002
boys in there and just chop their penis

3193.2 --> 3199.2799999999997
off like it's it's metaphorically that

3196.24 --> 3201.359
they're just literally like yeah

3199.28 --> 3202.3190000000004
it's a psychological attack that's what

3201.359 --> 3205.52
they do

3202.319 --> 3208.0
it's been doing it for a while

3205.52 --> 3212.359
movie idiocracy sums it up perfect yeah

3208.0 --> 3212.359
unfortunately it kind of does

3232.96 --> 3238.2400000000002
such jealousy

3235.28 --> 3241.44
what jealousy or what

3238.24 --> 3243.839
are you projecting again charlie welch

3241.44 --> 3245.92
i mean i don't have to ask i know you

3243.839 --> 3248.24
are that's what you all do

3245.92 --> 3250.319
you only ever speak up when you're

3248.24 --> 3254.5589999999997
frustrated about something you feel so

3250.319 --> 3258.16
then you project it hundred percent

3254.559 --> 3260.96
on whatever dissatisfies you so i don't

3258.16 --> 3260.96
even have to ask

3263.52 --> 3267.7599999999998
just like that dart guys pretty much

3265.44 --> 3269.28
everything you say

3267.76 --> 3272.2400000000002
just

3269.28 --> 3274.1600000000003
read it as if it is literally exactly

3272.24 --> 3276.0
the opposite of what you're saying

3274.16 --> 3277.359
through projection and then it all makes

3276.0 --> 3278.96
perfect sense

3277.359 --> 3281.52
i can read you

3278.96 --> 3284.0
like a book

3281.52 --> 3288.599
you can't even read you yourself like a

3284.0 --> 3288.599
book i can read you though

3294.559 --> 3300.3190000000004
bro no it got electrolytes

3297.599 --> 3303.04
but maybe you want to use water what you

3300.319 --> 3303.04
mean from the

3304.839 --> 3310.0789999999997
toilet that was amazing i love that like

3308.319 --> 3311.839
that's like one of my

3310.079 --> 3314.96
the part that i kind of treasure is like

3311.839 --> 3317.2
when they say what water from the toilet

3314.96 --> 3319.44
that's like really funny

3317.2 --> 3321.839
and also it's like

3319.44 --> 3325.44
it's well crafted because that is kind

3321.839 --> 3327.2799999999997
of what they would say right it's really

3325.44 --> 3330.319
well thought out

3327.28 --> 3333.88
the guy that made the movie was a genius

3330.319 --> 3333.88
he really was

3344.48 --> 3351.359
because he's he spent so much

3348.4 --> 3354.0
time on the details right on the he made

3351.359 --> 3356.24
it all natural that was what's really

3354.0 --> 3358.88
it's not just like everybody's a [ __ ]

3356.24 --> 3360.319
no it was actually natural it was worked

3358.88 --> 3364.319
out

3360.319 --> 3367.44
like everybody was really into like

3364.319 --> 3370.24
what it's like they really tried to

3367.44 --> 3372.64
naturally show like what the culture

3370.24 --> 3374.5589999999997
would be like how people would be like

3372.64 --> 3378.48
if it was that stupid and it's brilliant

3374.559 --> 3382.0
yeah mike judge great

3378.48 --> 3382.0
this is best movie for sure

3383.599 --> 3389.48
does he even have any other movies i

3385.2 --> 3389.48
don't know but it's a great movie

3400.64 --> 3405.04
yeah babies and but that was hilarious

3402.4 --> 3407.76
it's terrible but hilarious i had so

3405.04 --> 3410.06
many crazy times and laughs with beaves

3407.76 --> 3412.559
and butthead

3410.06 --> 3415.119
[Music]

3412.559 --> 3418.0
those 90s

3415.119 --> 3420.1600000000003
yeah but idiocracy was something else

3418.0 --> 3423.16
like that was like a really high class

3420.16 --> 3423.16
movie

3446.4 --> 3451.7200000000003
now i'm not going to do impression of

3447.839 --> 3451.72
beefs and butter sorry

3460.559 --> 3464.6400000000003
what did everybody drink instead of

3462.24 --> 3468.0789999999997
water bronzo

3464.64 --> 3468.0789999999997
like the energy drink

3470.24 --> 3475.24
with like sugar and [ __ ] in there

3486.88 --> 3491.839
yeah okay rockin that's hilarious

3489.44 --> 3496.079
i didn't know that

3491.839 --> 3496.0789999999997
i was off by 490 years

3496.48 --> 3500.72
yeah he did well in a way it he did kind

3499.44 --> 3503.359
of like

3500.72 --> 3505.52
underestimate right he underestimated

3503.359 --> 3507.359
how quickly everybody would become

3505.52 --> 3509.839
[ __ ] like that

3507.359 --> 3511.5989999999997
how quick that would go

3509.839 --> 3513.68
he played it out

3511.599 --> 3517.119
like it took a lot more time when in

3513.68 --> 3521.04
reality no people turning into complete

3517.119 --> 3523.599
apeshit idiots that goes very fast

3521.04 --> 3523.599
that's like

3523.839 --> 3528.16
two generations

3525.839 --> 3530.48
three at most and then it's they're all

3528.16 --> 3532.48
gone they're just all gonna like start

3530.48 --> 3535.119
eating each other

3532.48 --> 3537.599
it's that quick

3535.119 --> 3540.0
people like when they're subjected by

3537.599 --> 3542.6400000000003
terrible predatory government that wants

3540.0 --> 3544.799
them to self-destroy

3542.64 --> 3546.5589999999997
they're gonna destroy themselves really

3544.799 --> 3549.68
quickly

3546.559 --> 3551.28
that doesn't take 500 years that takes

3549.68 --> 3554.3999999999996
50 years

3551.28 --> 3554.4
20 years maybe

3569.52 --> 3572.64
right

3570.4 --> 3576.079
people are seriously [ __ ]

3572.64 --> 3578.48
well retardation is a defense strategy

3576.079 --> 3581.2000000000003
right it's a spiritual defense strategy

3578.48 --> 3584.2400000000002
and if there is a giant like satanic

3581.2 --> 3584.96
spiritual attack on everybody

3584.24 --> 3587.4399999999996
and

3584.96 --> 3589.76
like oh if you stand out if you show

3587.44 --> 3592.64
that you're smarter

3589.76 --> 3594.48
you're gonna like really suffer for it

3592.64 --> 3596.16
yeah everybody's gonna be literally

3594.48 --> 3598.96
encouraged to be [ __ ] it's a

3596.16 --> 3601.1189999999997
spiritual defense strategy

3598.96 --> 3604.559
unfortunately it also completely takes

3601.119 --> 3604.559
away all grip and power

3606.96 --> 3611.04
on the long run it doesn't work on the

3608.96 --> 3612.88
short run it does work right and that's

3611.04 --> 3614.96
why it exists

3612.88 --> 3617.76
people become [ __ ] not because they

3614.96 --> 3620.48
are naturally [ __ ] they become it as

3617.76 --> 3622.0
a spiritual defense against savage

3620.48 --> 3623.76
double thinking

3622.0 --> 3626.0
attacks

3623.76 --> 3627.5200000000004
on their dignity on their culture on

3626.0 --> 3631.04
everything they like

3627.52 --> 3631.04
that's why they become [ __ ]

3633.359 --> 3636.16
right

3634.24 --> 3637.52
if that stops

3636.16 --> 3638.3999999999996
it takes

3637.52 --> 3641.04
one

3638.4 --> 3643.599
generation one

3641.04 --> 3645.52
and the kids that will not be subjected

3643.599 --> 3647.119
to this insanity well maybe through

3645.52 --> 3650.0
their parents

3647.119 --> 3652.4
they will actually just be completely

3650.0 --> 3655.04
mentally restored

3652.4 --> 3657.839
just takes one generation of not being

3655.04 --> 3659.2
savagely psychologically attacked with

3657.839 --> 3662.24
doublespeak

3659.2 --> 3666.04
and they will immediately restore

3662.24 --> 3666.04
just one generation

3670.88 --> 3676.079
right unless there's also poison right

3672.88 --> 3677.92
there's also the poison compound

3676.079 --> 3680.0
but yeah rig back

3677.92 --> 3682.64
you never you never thought of it like

3680.0 --> 3685.2
that really because i've been really

3682.64 --> 3687.04
[ __ ] in my life yeah yeah it sounds

3685.2 --> 3687.9199999999996
so funny right now yeah it's not now

3687.04 --> 3689.599
though

3687.92 --> 3692.16
but

3689.599 --> 3693.92
say 20 years ago

3692.16 --> 3696.48
nah

3693.92 --> 3698.7200000000003
it's it's complicated because i was like

3696.48 --> 3700.2400000000002
a [ __ ] genius

3698.72 --> 3702.3999999999996
seriously that sounds really

3700.24 --> 3703.9199999999996
contradictive right it wasn't

3702.4 --> 3707.119
so on one hand

3703.92 --> 3709.76
i could ha i had that like fine-tuned

3707.119 --> 3713.839
digging talent and the psych the the

3709.76 --> 3716.3190000000004
even semi-telepathy i had that back then

3713.839 --> 3719.119
on the other hand i was like

3716.319 --> 3722.319
i am part of the collective

3719.119 --> 3726.4
i do not believe in evil it cannot exist

3722.319 --> 3729.44
i was really [ __ ] dumb like really

3726.4 --> 3730.48
really naive and [ __ ] right

3729.44 --> 3733.68
brilliant

3730.48 --> 3735.68
super dumb at the same time

3733.68 --> 3737.1189999999997
and people would really be put off by it

3735.68 --> 3738.16
and they would be really freaked out

3737.119 --> 3739.52
even

3738.16 --> 3740.96
because first they thought i was on the

3739.52 --> 3742.4
intellect because i was explaining

3740.96 --> 3744.4
something that was really complicated to

3742.4 --> 3746.0
them and then they would be like oh that

3744.4 --> 3749.52
guy's really smart but then in another

3746.0 --> 3752.0
situation i would act like a freaking

3749.52 --> 3754.0
sjw [ __ ]

3752.0 --> 3755.76
not as bad as you get to see them

3754.0 --> 3758.559
nowadays but

3755.76 --> 3760.48
like that yeah i would terrible i'm so

3758.559 --> 3763.92
ashamed of it but

3760.48 --> 3763.92
that's just that will work

3764.0 --> 3766.0
so

3765.119 --> 3769.2000000000003
it's

3766.0 --> 3771.2
retardation is a psychological defense

3769.2 --> 3772.96
mechanism it's because you're being

3771.2 --> 3774.48
spiritually attacked

3772.96 --> 3776.4
that you can't handle it anymore you

3774.48 --> 3778.319
don't want to stick out

3776.4 --> 3780.319
because that makes the pain

3778.319 --> 3782.5589999999997
come back and you can't do anything

3780.319 --> 3784.4
about it but just sit through it

3782.559 --> 3786.48
you don't know how to get out of that

3784.4 --> 3788.799
situation so you're just gonna make

3786.48 --> 3792.559
yourself dumb

3788.799 --> 3792.559
people do that all the time now

3793.44 --> 3797.28
right we all had [ __ ] moments in

3795.039 --> 3799.28
life yeah that why

3797.28 --> 3802.1600000000003
because we were facing something we

3799.28 --> 3802.1600000000003
couldn't handle

3805.359 --> 3811.839
and what do you do when you're facing

3807.359 --> 3811.839
something you can't handle you play dumb

3812.72 --> 3817.72
that's what almost everybody does

3824.96 --> 3827.96
anyway

3848.799 --> 3855.359
flatter sage that is so typical that is

3852.48 --> 3857.039
so typical isn't it

3855.359 --> 3859.839
yeah

3857.039 --> 3862.96
well i talked about space and all that

3859.839 --> 3866.16
and planets and i was i was constantly

3862.96 --> 3868.799
emulating those supposed intellects that

3866.16 --> 3871.2
knew everything like the atheist

3868.799 --> 3873.359
space talk intellect i was always

3871.2 --> 3875.1189999999997
emulating that and people thought oh

3873.359 --> 3876.799
you're real you're one of them oh you're

3875.119 --> 3878.839
going to be great they said to me you're

3876.799 --> 3880.559
going to be great one

3878.839 --> 3883.68
day

3880.559 --> 3886.799
well they don't say that anymore

3883.68 --> 3886.799
those people are like

3887.359 --> 3890.48
don't want to know

3891.52 --> 3894.72
they're probably all [ __ ] their

3893.2 --> 3896.319
pants

3894.72 --> 3898.72
because they think like oh my god he

3896.319 --> 3901.839
turned into darth vader

3898.72 --> 3904.3999999999996
and i guess in a way i have and even the

3901.839 --> 3907.4
rage sometimes and [ __ ] so

3904.4 --> 3907.4
yeah

3911.52 --> 3916.24
all right but yeah that i'm not going to

3914.0 --> 3919.839
live in the reversed world

3916.24 --> 3922.0789999999997
i dispel it i'm going to break it apart

3919.839 --> 3925.0389999999998
i'm going to break your reversed world

3922.079 --> 3928.0
dream that you think is okay to live in

3925.039 --> 3929.2000000000003
that to turn everything inside out and

3928.0 --> 3930.0
literally

3929.2 --> 3933.4399999999996
just

3930.0 --> 3935.92
destroying and poisoning everything in

3933.44 --> 3939.28
the process making everybody more and

3935.92 --> 3941.44
more [ __ ] over time yeah

3939.28 --> 3944.079
i'm going to break that

3941.44 --> 3944.079
i am

3944.4 --> 3948.88
the nail

3946.559 --> 3950.559
that's ding ding ding that's going to

3948.88 --> 3953.119
break the whole

3950.559 --> 3955.28
split the whole rock apart that's what i

3953.119 --> 3955.28
am

3955.599 --> 3960.559
yeah i'm already in there i'm already

3957.599 --> 3963.599
widgeted in there it's very painful it's

3960.559 --> 3966.3190000000004
very stressful i go nuts

3963.599 --> 3969.039
but i'm not gonna go away because i'm

3966.319 --> 3970.799
harder i'm made of harder stuff

3969.039 --> 3972.88
yeah i've been through [ __ ]

3970.799 --> 3975.2
psychological [ __ ]

3972.88 --> 3976.319
you can't even imagine

3975.2 --> 3980.64
that

3976.319 --> 3980.64
i don't ever want to talk about

3982.16 --> 3986.64
because of just

3983.68 --> 3989.44
the implications it's too much

3986.64 --> 3991.44
there are things people just can't

3989.44 --> 3993.28
handle and that's it an

3991.44 --> 3996.16
absolute

3993.28 --> 4000.3190000000004
indivisible fact there's things people

3996.16 --> 4004.5589999999997
can't handle it i made myself face it

4000.319 --> 4007.52
because of this because i want it to be

4004.559 --> 4009.6800000000003
that what do you call the chisel

4007.52 --> 4012.0
or is the spike what do you call those

4009.68 --> 4012.0
things

4014.96 --> 4018.599
it feels silly

4024.079 --> 4030.079
right so yeah i had to go through that

4027.44 --> 4032.48
to be able to be that hard to not be

4030.079 --> 4034.48
dissuaded from it

4032.48 --> 4036.2400000000002
and i'm doing it

4034.48 --> 4039.44
splitting it up

4036.24 --> 4043.1189999999997
i'm breaking this reversed world spell

4039.44 --> 4044.88
which has just engulfed society i'm

4043.119 --> 4046.48
breaking it and i'm not going to stop

4044.88 --> 4049.28
breaking it

4046.48 --> 4051.92
and yeah unlike owen benjamin i'm not

4049.28 --> 4052.799
really doing it with comedy

4051.92 --> 4054.4
right

4052.799 --> 4056.96
i guess it's cool

4054.4 --> 4059.52
it's very cool that there is comedy and

4056.96 --> 4063.039
i like what owen benjamin does

4059.52 --> 4065.119
i'm much more like the painful part of

4063.039 --> 4065.119
it

4068.319 --> 4072.24
i'm not just here to entertain now owen

4070.319 --> 4074.0
benjamin isn't just there to entertain

4072.24 --> 4076.5589999999997
either he actually informs through what

4074.0 --> 4079.039
he does i'm not doing that

4076.559 --> 4080.1600000000003
i'm just like

4079.039 --> 4082.7200000000003
straight

4080.16 --> 4084.64
ramming that spike in your brain

4082.72 --> 4087.839
breaking that spell

4084.64 --> 4087.839
whether you like it or not

4088.559 --> 4093.599
and that's why some people

4090.4 --> 4096.799
get so unbelievably triggered

4093.599 --> 4097.839
and they like in a panicked frenzy try

4096.799 --> 4100.08
to like

4097.839 --> 4102.159
blackmail me or something they think

4100.08 --> 4105.839
they can blackmail me with things that i

4102.159 --> 4105.839
just openly discuss

4106.799 --> 4112.56
because i just get to them and i get to

4109.279 --> 4115.359
them because i don't use humor

4112.56 --> 4117.279
i mean i use humor sometimes but i don't

4115.359 --> 4119.359
do that as a default i'm not always

4117.279 --> 4120.56
looking how can i make a joke about no

4119.359 --> 4125.120000000001

4120.56 --> 4125.120000000001
ram it straight in your [ __ ] skull

4363.28 --> 4366.4
what do you think about that

4368.96 --> 4375.28
ah don't delete mr pickle

4371.679 --> 4375.28
i was just having fun with him

4379.92 --> 4386.32
i mean oh i need a doctor so much oh i'm

4382.719 --> 4388.08
so oh i'm in medical distress no no i

4386.32 --> 4390.88
think that you're just projecting i

4388.08 --> 4393.04
think you're in medical distress

4390.88 --> 4397.56
you smoke weed

4393.04 --> 4397.56
oh my god really when

4399.6 --> 4402.2390000000005
you don't know

4404.48 --> 4409.44
what you think that

4405.84 --> 4413.4800000000005
smoking weed makes you need a doctor

4409.44 --> 4413.48
the [ __ ] wrong with you

4413.76 --> 4418.8
you don't seem to really understand what

4415.44 --> 4422.0
the hell is going on mr pickle

4418.8 --> 4422.0
who is in your head

4424.0 --> 4428.719
me

4424.8 --> 4428.719
i'm here right here

4429.6 --> 4433.52
i got a lot of connections though yeah

4432.0 --> 4437.199
yeah i can

4433.52 --> 4439.679
take on some creepy [ __ ]

4437.199 --> 4443.12
if i choose to and then i can control it

4439.679 --> 4445.12
yeah and that's kind of unique isn't it

4443.12 --> 4447.5199999999995
i can let things in my head and then

4445.12 --> 4450.08
control them and then let it die down

4447.52 --> 4453.120000000001
and not be like super stressed out

4450.08 --> 4456.64
because of it the rest of the day

4453.12 --> 4456.64
had to actually train that

4456.719 --> 4459.04
because

4459.36 --> 4463.28
expression of that sort of level of

4461.679 --> 4464.96
feelings can be

4463.28 --> 4466.639999999999
physically painful

4464.96 --> 4468.4
especially if you're not used to it it's

4466.64 --> 4470.4800000000005
like you burn up

4468.4 --> 4473.92
it's very painful

4470.48 --> 4473.919999999999
i've learned to deal with it

4474.8 --> 4484.2390000000005
i've trained it so now i am a gateway i

4480.84 --> 4487.28
can stand on any part of the staircase i

4484.239 --> 4490.32
choose i can go there i can be

4487.28 --> 4492.639999999999
other forms of myself

4490.32 --> 4494.179999999999
and it's all me it's all me it's all

4492.64 --> 4495.52
natural all things that

4494.18 --> 4497.1990000000005
[Music]

4495.52 --> 4499.040000000001
no inkling of what that is because

4497.199 --> 4500.159
you're so

4499.04 --> 4502.719
stuck

4500.159 --> 4503.92
in a singular position on the staircase

4502.719 --> 4506.4
in your head

4503.92 --> 4508.4800000000005
you don't even recognize that there is a

4506.4 --> 4510.879999999999
staircase anymore you don't understand

4508.48 --> 4512.879999999999
anything about it you don't know

4510.88 --> 4515.679
anything about subtle communication

4512.88 --> 4519.1990000000005
about subconscious communication you're

4515.679 --> 4520.719
just a out of your mind desensitized

4519.199 --> 4523.678999999999
squirt boy

4520.719 --> 4524.96
that's projecting all their own anxiety

4523.679 --> 4526.32
and misery

4524.96 --> 4527.84
on somebody

4526.32 --> 4530.639999999999
like me

4527.84 --> 4533.360000000001
that doesn't have that and can just

4530.64 --> 4534.56
freely express themselves on their own

4533.36 --> 4537.199
platform

4534.56 --> 4539.84
and even get funds by people that

4537.199 --> 4543.28
appreciate him for doing that

4539.84 --> 4544.88
for being able to explain things yeah

4543.28 --> 4549.36
i'm not the one that needs a doctor i

4544.88 --> 4549.36
think that you actually need a doctor

4549.679 --> 4554.4
right but unfortunately i'm not a doctor

4552.48 --> 4556.0
like that i

4554.4 --> 4557.759999999999
you can't just

4556.0 --> 4560.56
force

4557.76 --> 4562.96
a prescription or an advice out of me

4560.56 --> 4564.159000000001
when you go in with that behavior you're

4562.96 --> 4568.32
gonna have to

4564.159 --> 4571.36
overcome your own defiance first

4568.32 --> 4573.04
and just be honest about who you are

4571.36 --> 4574.799999999999
what you're feeling

4573.04 --> 4577.6
and that you have a problem that you

4574.8 --> 4579.28
have a psychological emotional problem

4577.6 --> 4582.56
that you don't know how to deal with and

4579.28 --> 4585.04
that's why you go to

4582.56 --> 4587.92
other people's

4585.04 --> 4591.12
shows live shows in their chats

4587.92 --> 4594.4
anonymously like a little cowardly [ __ ]

4591.12 --> 4596.4
and then start projecting your miserable

4594.4 --> 4598.159
miserable life on me

4596.4 --> 4600.239
it doesn't work

4598.159 --> 4602.639999999999
everybody knows it like

4600.239 --> 4604.879999999999
you are literally the only one you might

4602.64 --> 4606.96
be able to fool you

4604.88 --> 4610.2390000000005
you can only really fool yourself

4606.96 --> 4612.719
because it's so obvious by now that

4610.239 --> 4616.5599999999995
nobody here in this chat

4612.719 --> 4619.56
doesn't understand that about you

4616.56 --> 4619.56
okay

4624.8 --> 4629.04
yeah mr pickle

4626.64 --> 4631.12
i know you're in a pickle

4629.04 --> 4634.0
you need to stop projecting

4631.12 --> 4636.159
and then then you might find salvation

4634.0 --> 4638.4
right but first you gotta get out of

4636.159 --> 4641.599999999999
that reversed world you gotta set it

4638.4 --> 4643.759999999999
right you gotta be real about what you

4641.6 --> 4645.6
are what you've become before you can do

4643.76 --> 4647.679
anything about it

4645.6 --> 4649.679
if you just keep projecting

4647.679 --> 4651.12
keep sticking to that reversed world

4649.679 --> 4653.4400000000005
reality

4651.12 --> 4655.28
to delude yourself with you will stay

4653.44 --> 4656.4
like that forever

4655.28 --> 4659.5199999999995
forever

4656.4 --> 4661.199
beyond death forever

4659.52 --> 4664.88
you will never

4661.199 --> 4668.4
feel reality again

4664.88 --> 4670.56
you will literally go to that

4668.4 --> 4672.32
with that to hell

4670.56 --> 4675.280000000001
that's not what you want you gotta stop

4672.32 --> 4676.84
you gotta move on

4675.28 --> 4679.92
you gotta

4676.84 --> 4682.0
apply what god gave you

4679.92 --> 4683.6
and fix things

4682.0 --> 4685.6
face the pain

4683.6 --> 4688.719
get real

4685.6 --> 4688.719
actually get real

4690.08 --> 4694.0
and then it might stop then the pain

4691.92 --> 4696.8
might actually stop right the pain

4694.0 --> 4698.64
really stops once you finally are ready

4696.8 --> 4702.0
to accept it

4698.64 --> 4702.0
that's when the pain stops

4702.159 --> 4706.719
if you refuse then it's just gonna nag

4704.8 --> 4710.4400000000005
and chew on you until there's nothing

4706.719 --> 4710.44
left from you

4734.32 --> 4737.759999999999
what are you talking about

4736.0 --> 4739.199

4749.04 --> 4752.719

4751.76 --> 4756.159000000001
really

4752.719 --> 4756.159
really terrible habit

4756.4 --> 4763.04
stop doing that it's not funny it's just

4759.36 --> 4766.239
really [ __ ] disgusting and that

4763.04 --> 4768.56
disgustingness reflects on you it makes

reserved like yesterday i was very

5120.32 --> 5125.36
triggerable today i am not

5125.36 --> 5128.32
weaning off

5127.28 --> 5132.4
oh

5128.32 --> 5132.4

5135.36 --> 5138.96

5178.48 --> 5184.08
my quota for today

5182.4 --> 5187.28
that's great

5184.08 --> 5188.239
it means i will be able to

5187.28 --> 5190.48
eat

5188.239 --> 5194.599999999999
tomorrow as well

5190.48 --> 5194.599999999999
that's great thank you

5203.12 --> 5208.159
all right by the way for those who are

5204.88 --> 5212.08
still like really afraid

5208.159 --> 5215.04
of the russia ukraine situation yeah

5212.08 --> 5215.04
read this article

5219.44 --> 5222.159
from rt

5222.8 --> 5226.96
it's a beautiful day yeah it is fishy

5224.56 --> 5229.679
for me it is kind of a beautiful day

5226.96 --> 5231.6
also it's not as windy

5229.679 --> 5233.28
because that wind was really getting on

5231.6 --> 5234.96
my nerve i don't like it when it's

5233.28 --> 5237.5199999999995
constantly just

5234.96 --> 5239.52
when it's cold i hate that well it's

5237.52 --> 5242.2390000000005
still a bit windy but i guess that the

5239.52 --> 5246.120000000001
wind is

5242.239 --> 5246.12
it's warmed up a little

5252.32 --> 5256.48
how do pigeons find their way home

5259.04 --> 5263.36
i think they use magnetic orientation

5264.08 --> 5267.84
a lot of birds do that

5275.12 --> 5280.08
they have special sensories for that

5277.679 --> 5281.6
i think people like human beings also

5280.08 --> 5283.76
have that but

5281.6 --> 5285.52
i think that the electronics has kind of

5283.76 --> 5288.159000000001
killed it off

5285.52 --> 5291.4400000000005
but i think that people that are like

5288.159 --> 5293.44
super remote that are like woodland only

5291.44 --> 5296.239
types that have never gotten out of the

5293.44 --> 5297.759999999999
woods i think they still have that sense

5296.239 --> 5300.239
as well

5297.76 --> 5303.92
i think the electronic era has killed

5300.239 --> 5303.919999999999
off the our magnetic sense

5305.199 --> 5309.839999999999
pictures gps

5307.36 --> 5309.839999999999
right

5316.239 --> 5318.959999999999
yeah i didn't pray well to be fair

5317.92 --> 5320.0
though

5318.96 --> 5322.08
adam

5320.0 --> 5323.6
mo yeah rasta thinks most people are

5322.08 --> 5325.92
wankers and

5323.6 --> 5328.4800000000005
in a way he does have a point it's just

5325.92 --> 5328.4800000000005
kind of like

5332.239 --> 5334.5599999999995
yeah

5333.04 --> 5336.8

5334.56 --> 5339.04

hey j dreamers

5475.6 --> 5479.1990000000005
we both of us

5477.28 --> 5480.719
because we weren't really used to live

5479.199 --> 5483.599999999999
streaming

5480.719 --> 5485.76
yeah five years ago man our time has

5483.6 --> 5487.52
flown

5485.76 --> 5490.52
five years

5487.52 --> 5490.52
huh

5502.32 --> 5507.36
right yeah and jay jay dreamers was one

5504.88 --> 5508.2390000000005
of the first guys who was digging into

5507.36 --> 5510.799999999999
like

5508.239 --> 5512.4
complicated hebrew and such like

5510.8 --> 5514.159000000001
literally

5512.4 --> 5515.28
because now there's plenty of people

5514.159 --> 5517.759999999999
right that

5515.28 --> 5519.679
know and like cross-reference hebrew and

5517.76 --> 5522.2390000000005
like bible research to get into hebrew

5519.679 --> 5524.4800000000005
right that happens all over

5522.239 --> 5526.718999999999
back in the day five years he was like

5524.48 --> 5529.28
one of the first guys that i knew that

5526.719 --> 5532.159
was doing that it was really interesting

5529.28 --> 5534.0
i learned a lot i learned also like wait

5532.159 --> 5536.799999999999
so there is complications with

5534.0 --> 5536.8
translation

5537.28 --> 5543.88
i never really understood that

5540.239 --> 5543.879999999999
before that point

5558.48 --> 5561.48
this

5563.84 --> 5568.0
right yeah my

5566.239 --> 5569.759999999999
what i thought was really interesting is

5568.0 --> 5573.28
his view on

5569.76 --> 5575.84
basically the layers he was like a

5573.28 --> 5577.759999999999
terrestrial layer guys that he thinks

5575.84 --> 5579.28
that there's like a ladder different

5577.76 --> 5581.52
layers

5579.28 --> 5585.5199999999995
different realms above one another and

5581.52 --> 5588.0
that there is a realm below us

5585.52 --> 5590.159000000001
which would be sort of considered shale

5588.0 --> 5592.159
but that there's like different types of

5590.159 --> 5594.799999999999
layers and that there's multiple realms

5592.159 --> 5596.638999999999
stacked upon one another like that

5594.8 --> 5598.88
that was one of his theories and he

5596.639 --> 5601.4400000000005
really dug into that concept it was very

5598.88 --> 5601.4400000000005
interesting

5601.679 --> 5605.76
like what would the light be like that

5603.6 --> 5607.6
the the purple sun inside and all i

5605.76 --> 5611.6
don't know he worked with a lot and he

5607.6 --> 5611.6
had a lot of great art art with it

5611.92 --> 5615.28
so it was it was kind of story time it

5614.08 --> 5617.5199999999995
was like

5615.28 --> 5620.48
like just dreamers like yeah dreaming

5617.52 --> 5622.56
right it wasn't like woo super detailed

5620.48 --> 5625.36
historical research no no it wasn't

5622.56 --> 5626.320000000001
technical like it was like a dreamer

5625.36 --> 5629.5199999999995
but he

5626.32 --> 5631.92
he did put down dis interesting

5629.52 --> 5631.92
visions

5643.52 --> 5647.280000000001
it was also one of the guys that

5644.96 --> 5649.04
basically said like yeah proto-humans

5647.28 --> 5651.759999999999
the humans before humans and they had

5649.04 --> 5651.76
blue skin

5656.239 --> 5661.44
and yeah there may be something to that

5658.639 --> 5663.12
i'm still not i've never like

5661.44 --> 5665.678999999999
rejected

5663.12 --> 5668.32
no i'm like yeah

5665.679 --> 5670.639
there might be something to that

5668.32 --> 5672.4
i think that we're not the

5670.639 --> 5676.08
original design

5672.4 --> 5679.44
like we are but we're like

5676.08 --> 5681.28
progress like redesigns

5679.44 --> 5684.48
like that we're not like the original

5681.28 --> 5687.36
adam and eve which i think were like

5684.48 --> 5689.839999999999
titans they were massive

5687.36 --> 5691.92
that's what i think right

5689.84 --> 5695.04
right but they who says that we had to

5691.92 --> 5699.88
have like fleshy skin and all that right

5695.04 --> 5699.88
so maybe they had like blue

5700.32 --> 5705.5199999999995
silicon skin or something i don't know

5702.639 --> 5708.88
it was interesting

5705.52 --> 5711.119000000001
it's a long time ago by now

5708.88 --> 5713.4400000000005
i've since then like branched off into

5711.119 --> 5715.839999999999
like figuring out like the different

5713.44 --> 5715.839999999999
ages

5720.239 --> 5726.36
i did that early on by the way still

5722.32 --> 5726.36
with the flatter talks days

5745.119 --> 5748.119
what

5760.56 --> 5765.679
right well adam price

5763.6 --> 5768.320000000001
by that standard

5765.679 --> 5770.719
you can think you can say anything but

5768.32 --> 5772.719
you just say nothing well that's then

5770.719 --> 5778.28
that makes that would make america the

5772.719 --> 5778.28
land of wasted opportunity wouldn't it

5806.0 --> 5808.32
hmm

5810.48 --> 5814.4
i've ever been to then boss yeah

5816.96 --> 5823.679
i've been well not really been there not

5819.76 --> 5825.679
really hung out there but i like drove

5823.679 --> 5828.159
past and through most places in the

5825.679 --> 5828.159
netherlands

5828.48 --> 5832.0
i've been pretty much everywhere

5834.08 --> 5840.04
but i don't really know a lot of big

5836.32 --> 5840.04
cities here well

5861.04 --> 5865.679
are there any guests i'd like on my show

5863.04 --> 5868.0
no yeah well

5865.679 --> 5870.4800000000005
they're flat it's a complicated it's a

5868.0 --> 5873.679
complicated issue i'm kind of like i'm

5870.48 --> 5876.08
liking this format i'm liking doing this

5873.679 --> 5878.0
i like that i just have the chat and

5876.08 --> 5879.679
anybody can get in there

5878.0 --> 5881.84
nobody's going to interrupt me there's

5879.679 --> 5882.8
not going to be like oh oh wait oh your

5881.84 --> 5885.52
talk oh

5882.8 --> 5887.360000000001
that there that's annoying stuff

5885.52 --> 5890.0
especially with people that aren't used

5887.36 --> 5892.5599999999995
to being on live streams

5890.0 --> 5895.719
right and

5892.56 --> 5895.719
i mean

5896.0 --> 5901.679
it just it would just be different

5899.119 --> 5905.599999999999
i'm kind of used to just monologuing now

5901.679 --> 5905.6
and just interacting with you guys

5907.119 --> 5913.44
i mean i guess i could have some people

5910.08 --> 5915.679
on if they wanted to associate with me

5913.44 --> 5915.678999999999
but

5917.36 --> 5921.44
yeah nobody seems to really be in a

5919.199 --> 5922.879999999999
hurry to get on my show

5921.44 --> 5926.4
unless they're like somebody that

5922.88 --> 5926.400000000001
literally nobody's ever heard of

5927.92 --> 5931.92
because people seem to

5929.679 --> 5934.4
that's even in the past early word shows

5931.92 --> 5936.08
people seem to be gladly using me as

5934.4 --> 5937.759999999999
some kind of a stepping stone as

5936.08 --> 5939.92
advertisement

5937.76 --> 5942.2390000000005
but like the bigger people that are

5939.92 --> 5944.32
already well known they don't contact me

5942.239 --> 5946.799999999999
at all

5944.32 --> 5948.5599999999995
like at all

5946.8 --> 5950.639
so

5948.56 --> 5953.84
yeah i'm i'm kind of satisfied with the

5950.639 --> 5953.84
way my show is right now

5955.38 --> 5958.439
[Music]

5960.159 --> 5964.4

5996.48 --> 6001.5199999999995
early bird show kind of for me

5999.119 --> 6003.199
so that i could be able to get things

6001.52 --> 6005.92
off my chest

6003.199 --> 6007.759999999999
before i get on his show and just start

6005.92 --> 6010.76
rumpusing because that's what used to

6007.76 --> 6010.76
happen

6025.52 --> 6032.080000000001
people with large child that come by

6027.52 --> 6032.080000000001

and you wake up a little early for me oh

6070.8 --> 6074.119000000001
that's nice

6080.239 --> 6084.4
tarot card don't mean squat what are you

6082.32 --> 6086.48
talking about johnny m you don't know

6084.4 --> 6088.32
what that is

6086.48 --> 6089.919999999999
cheap parlor tricks

6088.32 --> 6091.92
what the hell does it even have to do

6089.92 --> 6094.32
with a part what does tarot have to do

6091.92 --> 6097.36
with the parlor trick

6094.32 --> 6099.36
you obviously do not understand it at

6097.36 --> 6101.44
all

6099.36 --> 6103.28
it's not a trick

6101.44 --> 6109.04
it's a form of divination there's a

6103.28 --> 6111.28
pattern to it that's very well refined

6109.04 --> 6114.96
there's that's like it's

6111.28 --> 6117.599999999999
it's magic it's spirit energy

6114.96 --> 6120.4
patterns and it's not a cheap part or

6117.6 --> 6121.92
trick that's real it's all real it

6120.4 --> 6123.199
depends though

6121.92 --> 6124.639
the person

6123.199 --> 6128.239
doing it

6124.639 --> 6130.88
using the cards to do it for somebody

6128.239 --> 6133.28
and the one

6130.88 --> 6135.52
actually inquiring right

6133.28 --> 6136.719
both of those factors matter as to the

6135.52 --> 6137.6
results

6136.719 --> 6139.04
i

6137.6 --> 6144.719
personally have

6139.04 --> 6146.96
absolutely amazing like amazing results

6144.719 --> 6149.84
like really mind-blowing things where

6146.96 --> 6149.84
i'm like sometimes

6150.56 --> 6156.8
i get like offended by how

6153.84 --> 6158.719
blatantly straightforward to the point

6156.8 --> 6160.639
my tarot card and

6158.719 --> 6164.32
related cards

6160.639 --> 6167.76
get with me like how much it is like yes

6164.32 --> 6170.08
it is absolutely unmistakably this and

6167.76 --> 6171.84
you know it you felt it coming and it's

6170.08 --> 6175.119
like entangled with everything

6171.84 --> 6177.6
unmistakable there's nothing to be left

6175.119 --> 6180.88
a chance about the the laying of the

6177.6 --> 6183.76
card result here like it's so absolutely

6180.88 --> 6186.56
straightforward dead on target

6183.76 --> 6190.76
that's not coincidence

6186.56 --> 6190.76
like that's physically impossible

6191.679 --> 6196.88
so yeah it's not a partner trick it

6193.84 --> 6197.92
works it is kind of magic though

6196.88 --> 6200.96
it is

6197.92 --> 6202.4
of the spirit realm it can be tricky and

6200.96 --> 6205.199
hey

6202.4 --> 6206.96
tarot card you readers

6205.199 --> 6209.28
people that lay cards like that don't

6206.96 --> 6210.88
have to necessarily be good people so

6209.28 --> 6213.759999999999
you got to be careful who you're doing

6210.88 --> 6213.76
it with right

6213.92 --> 6217.28
you can get

6214.96 --> 6218.4
screwed over with tarot cards just the

6217.28 --> 6220.5599999999995
same

6218.4 --> 6222.879999999999
if you don't have the feel for if you

6220.56 --> 6224.719
don't realize like this person isn't

6222.88 --> 6227.76
actually doesn't have any good will

6224.719 --> 6230.2390000000005
towards me right you gotta know you have

6227.76 --> 6232.159000000001
to have the senses if you don't have the

6230.239 --> 6234.159
census then you don't know what's

6232.159 --> 6236.239
happening

6234.159 --> 6239.4
then you can't understand what it says

6236.239 --> 6239.4
to you

6253.05 --> 6256.8
[Music]

6254.88 --> 6258.96
don't mess with magic absolutely you

6256.8 --> 6262.159000000001
should take it very serious

6258.96 --> 6263.92
i do and that's why i don't just do that

6262.159 --> 6266.719
every day i'm not a guy that like oh i'm

6263.92 --> 6269.28
gonna lay a card every day no

6266.719 --> 6272.84
absolutely not

6269.28 --> 6275.28
i do it pretty much once a year during

6272.84 --> 6276.96
christmas because

6275.28 --> 6278.32
yeah because my

6276.96 --> 6279.84
stepmother

6278.32 --> 6282.96
does cards

6279.84 --> 6284.4800000000005
and she is like a master with it like a

6282.96 --> 6287.36
master

6284.48 --> 6289.678999999999
and so the results are like mind-blowing

6287.36 --> 6291.04
every single time like absolutely

6289.679 --> 6293.36
mind-blowing

6291.04 --> 6294.56
and she has like really beautiful card

6293.36 --> 6297.44
decks

6294.56 --> 6299.679
really amazing

6297.44 --> 6301.119
all kinds of cultural

6299.679 --> 6303.84
backgrounds

6301.119 --> 6303.839999999999
fascinating stuff

6311.119 --> 6316.48
it's not just the basic tarot it's also

6313.36 --> 6318.4
like druidic celtic

6316.48 --> 6322.0
and even like

6318.4 --> 6324.96
the whole directions like everything

6322.0 --> 6324.96
everything you can think

6328.84 --> 6334.88
of yeah well flatter sage maybe yeah a

6332.88 --> 6336.56
witch which

6334.88 --> 6339.1990000000005
that depends on how you're gonna define

6336.56 --> 6342.719
a witch because if they're just like

6339.199 --> 6345.599999999999
like a pagan woman

6342.719 --> 6348.32
there's nothing really bad about that

6345.6 --> 6350.08
but yeah don't get a tarot reading from

6348.32 --> 6352.799999999999
a satanist

6350.08 --> 6355.04
right i i rephrase it like that you

6352.8 --> 6358.08
don't want to have somebody that lives

6355.04 --> 6361.28
in the reversed world to do that because

6358.08 --> 6364.4
they will definitely use it

6361.28 --> 6366.5599999999995
to your detriment or their yeah they

6364.4 --> 6368.32
could or they could use it to bind

6366.56 --> 6372.080000000001
themselves to you

6368.32 --> 6373.119
to make you into their loyal servant

6372.08 --> 6375.5199999999995

6373.119 --> 6377.679
if that's what you meant then i agree

6375.52 --> 6381.1990000000005
gotta be very careful

6377.679 --> 6381.1990000000005

energy

6431.28 --> 6437.92
semi telepathy right oh

6434.08 --> 6440.08

6437.92 --> 6442.4800000000005
into people's memories even though they

6440.08 --> 6446.0
don't verbally share them with me and

6442.48 --> 6448.32
all that like i can find solutions to

6446.0 --> 6451.199
professional problems that i literally

6448.32 --> 6453.5199999999995
have never heard of before before i

6451.199 --> 6456.32
communicated with the individual yeah oh

6456.32 --> 6462.32
witch oh [ __ ] you i'm born with that

6459.119 --> 6465.199
skill it's a natural skill god designed

6462.32 --> 6466.5599999999995
me to be able to do that

6465.199 --> 6471.5199999999995
yeah

6466.56 --> 6474.4800000000005

6471.52 --> 6478.400000000001
so screw you

6474.48 --> 6481.759999999999
yeah it doesn't matter what you do

6478.4 --> 6485.04
what thing happens what matters is with

6481.76 --> 6488.0
what intent do you do that do you honor

6485.04 --> 6490.0
god do you honor the truth when you do

6488.0 --> 6491.679
anything right doesn't matter whether

6490.0 --> 6495.199
it's magic

6491.679 --> 6496.0
or whether it is a job

6495.199 --> 6498.96
or

6496.0 --> 6501.36
just talking it doesn't matter it

6498.96 --> 6503.76
doesn't matter what the thing is you do

6501.36 --> 6506.88
it only really matters is how you do it

6503.76 --> 6509.679
with what intent and if you honor god

6506.88 --> 6512.4800000000005
and the truth while you do it

6509.679 --> 6514.8
if you have a vision if you have a

6512.48 --> 6516.239
planned outcome for yourself all these

6514.8 --> 6518.08
things are

6516.239 --> 6522.32
magic

6518.08 --> 6524.0
magic is literally the fabric

6522.32 --> 6527.0
that our spirit

6524.0 --> 6527.0
is

6527.36 --> 6530.4

6830.32 --> 6833.32
troll

6839.28 --> 6842.32

6844.0 --> 6847.199
getting a little loud in a certain

6846.159 --> 6849.679
moment

6847.199 --> 6852.159
right there's constant noise everywhere

6849.679 --> 6854.2390000000005
from people working

6852.159 --> 6855.839999999999
drilling in the walls and [ __ ] i don't

6854.239 --> 6858.08
think they're gonna give a [ __ ] if i get

6855.84 --> 6859.599
a little loud in a moment

6858.08 --> 6862.639
by the way it's not even that bad it's

6859.599 --> 6864.4800000000005
not even full lungs so i just get a

6862.639 --> 6866.4800000000005
little closer to the mic

6864.48 --> 6869.598999999999
right then again get then i can be

6866.48 --> 6871.119
louder to you guys

6869.599 --> 6874.96
yeah just

6871.119 --> 6877.199
don't put our wind on loudspeaker

6874.96 --> 6880.199
with maximum volume and you'll be all

6877.199 --> 6880.199
right

6903.84 --> 6909.719
god

6905.119 --> 6909.719
now the place is getting zerged here

6919.44 --> 6924.719
idiot can't believe how i hate people

6922.239 --> 6924.718999999999
like that

6925.36 --> 6931.119
i hate him

6928.0 --> 6933.84
yeah i hate people that do that that

6931.119 --> 6936.4
chant [ __ ] they don't understand i hate

6933.84 --> 6937.599
them more than satanists

6936.4 --> 6939.759999999999
because most of the time at least

6937.599 --> 6941.599
satanists understand the creepy [ __ ]

6939.76 --> 6943.119000000001
they're doing they actually understand

6941.599 --> 6944.96
the consequences

6943.119 --> 6946.639
like this person literally doesn't know

6944.96 --> 6950.4
what the [ __ ] he's blabbering about he's

6946.639 --> 6950.400000000001
just chanting like a [ __ ]

6951.36 --> 6954.92
i hate that

6968.8 --> 6974.56
yeah

6970.32 --> 6976.32
i love christ i hate people that chant

6974.56 --> 6978.159000000001
that don't understand what the hell

6976.32 --> 6980.48
they're talking about they just use

6978.159 --> 6982.96
words and don't understand what they

6980.48 --> 6985.36
even mean what they're implying what the

6982.96 --> 6988.32
context of that entire

6985.36 --> 6990.719
moment in the bible even is re right

6988.32 --> 6993.679
because that's important the context

6990.719 --> 6993.679
means everything

6993.92 --> 6998.28
and opinions from people don't matter

6997.04 --> 6999.92
[ __ ]

6998.28 --> 7004.719
consensus

6999.92 --> 7006.96
opinion from people doesn't matter [ __ ]

7004.719 --> 7008.56
it doesn't matter anything the only

7006.96 --> 7011.679
thing that matters

7008.56 --> 7013.4400000000005
is that it has complicated meanings and

7011.679 --> 7014.96
it has a context

7013.44 --> 7017.839999999999
and that you should do everything in

7014.96 --> 7019.679
your power to understand that and then

7017.84 --> 7021.4400000000005
in the process realize that it's

7019.679 --> 7024.4
probably going to turn out to be more

7021.44 --> 7024.4
than you can handle

7024.56 --> 7028.159000000001
once you're there

7026.159 --> 7030.4
that's when you're ready

7028.159 --> 7032.799999999999
that's when you're actually ready to

7030.4 --> 7035.28
kind of like make judgment

7032.8 --> 7037.84
but you'll be less inclined to right

7035.28 --> 7040.159
because you're not as possessed by a

7037.84 --> 7044.32
demon fueled by ignorance that's going

7040.159 --> 7046.879999999999
to make you assault other people

7044.32 --> 7049.5199999999995
right bible bashing devil persecutors

7046.88 --> 7050.96
yeah guess what devil persecutors are

7049.52 --> 7053.52
they're devils

7050.96 --> 7057.96
because the person is vacant and let

7053.52 --> 7057.96
them fill up with a devil

7063.04 --> 7068.08
you can't accomplish anything

7066.08 --> 7071.48
if you don't understand what you're

7068.08 --> 7071.48
talking about

7073.36 --> 7076.36
huh

7088.88 --> 7093.92
yeah i'm gonna run out to show

7091.92 --> 7095.76
guess i had to blow up one more time

7093.92 --> 7099.76
anyway i didn't even blow up against the

7095.76 --> 7102.639
blatant trolls it's so annoying

7099.76 --> 7102.639
it's just that

7103.04 --> 7107.44
bad bible thumpers and i don't even like

7105.84 --> 7108.4800000000005
to say that right

7107.44 --> 7111.919999999999
just

7108.48 --> 7113.678999999999
i i hate them more than trolls

7111.92 --> 7115.599
trolls i can figure out i can just

7113.679 --> 7119.4400000000005
address exactly what's happening with

7115.599 --> 7120.4800000000005
them and they will actually just like

7119.44 --> 7123.04
like

7120.48 --> 7123.919999999999
fall behind they will just fall in line

7123.04 --> 7126.0
right

7123.92 --> 7128.719
bible thumpers once you trigger that

7126.0 --> 7130.48
[ __ ] they'll just never stop blabbering

7128.719 --> 7133.119
like an arrogant piece of [ __ ] and

7130.48 --> 7134.718999999999
they'll just move on from one [ __ ]

7133.119 --> 7135.839999999999
thing to another

7134.719 --> 7137.92
just

7135.84 --> 7140.2390000000005
like a rumpus

7137.92 --> 7143.76
right because they don't understand it

7140.239 --> 7146.638999999999
but they can absolutely scatter gun you

7143.76 --> 7149.679
with [ __ ] more of it until you tire

7146.639 --> 7152.8
out and i hate that i hate that tactic i

7149.679 --> 7154.639
hate people that do that i absolutely

7152.8 --> 7156.639
despise them

7154.639 --> 7160.32
i think it's an affront

7156.639 --> 7160.32
it's an affront to christ

7165.199 --> 7168.5599999999995
right anyway

7167.04 --> 7170.719
i'm over it now

7168.56 --> 7172.4800000000005
so thanks everyone for coming

7170.719 --> 7174.719
i hope you liked this show i thought it
