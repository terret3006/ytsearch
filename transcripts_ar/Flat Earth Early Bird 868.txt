sun though it is a lot warmer

and glad to have it back because it's

126.079 --> 131.44
been kind of

128.399 --> 133.84
a little shady with all the clouds this

131.44 --> 133.84
morning

140.08 --> 148.48000000000002
all right so it's monday the 19th

145.2 --> 151.67999999999998
of april 2021

148.48 --> 156.07999999999998
i'm your host irwin of course

151.68 --> 161.28
tom parker first in chat

156.08 --> 161.28
good to see you all right

172.0 --> 175.28
relatively simple day yesterday it was

174.48 --> 177.92
really just

175.28 --> 179.519
like a day of rest for me in ways

177.92 --> 185.83999999999997
because i just took it easy

179.519 --> 185.84
and it was good

188.56 --> 192.4
yeah kind of after the show yesterday

191.12 --> 196.0
you had a good

192.4 --> 199.84
weekend hope you had a good weekend yes

196.0 --> 199.84
i did tom parker overall i did

200.319 --> 207.92
a couple of like yeah unpleasant

204.159 --> 210.79899999999998
realizations but as for myself

207.92 --> 210.79899999999998
it was pretty good

210.959 --> 213.84
um

222.72 --> 227.84
let me make the notes

233.2 --> 241.83999999999997
seems like the trolls are also here

242.56 --> 250.48
uh yeah after the show yesterday

246.239 --> 250.48000000000002
uh there was premieres and all that

250.72 --> 255.84
from nathan that was pretty good i've

253.92 --> 257.68
been watching a lot of stranger things

255.84 --> 261.519
like the third season

257.68 --> 264.8
not the entire thing yet but i have been

261.519 --> 264.8
just continue watching

265.44 --> 270.0
it is really an amusing series like even

267.919 --> 272.639
the third season is really not bad

270.0 --> 272.639
although it's

274.639 --> 278.40000000000003
no yeah no it was pretty good

278.639 --> 286.0
uh as i remember it

282.16 --> 287.84000000000003
right also uh paula did a live stream

286.0 --> 290.16
it was kind of weird seeing it because

287.84 --> 293.28
she changed from bible literally to

290.16 --> 296.96000000000004
level up i guess that

293.28 --> 300.08
bible literally didn't really fit

296.96 --> 304.0
all that well anymore to her

300.08 --> 306.71999999999997
so yeah she just decided that

304.0 --> 308.4
yeah it's not a bad idea in my opinion

306.72 --> 310.47900000000004
but yeah

308.4 --> 312.32
like she has her own way of doing things

310.479 --> 315.44
uh

312.32 --> 316.32
also have been active again on 24 7

315.44 --> 318.96
discord

316.32 --> 318.96
a little later

321.52 --> 325.12
have you heard from steve lately a witch

324.479 --> 328.56
steve

325.12 --> 329.6
there's a lot of steve's you mean good

328.56 --> 332.8
servant

329.6 --> 335.52000000000004
yeah he was in the chat yesterday and

332.8 --> 337.28000000000003
i'm like he's there's an open

335.52 --> 340.96
communication line again

337.28 --> 340.96
between us on skype

342.24 --> 345.36
and he's doing fine

346.0 --> 355.28
right thought you met him

352.639 --> 357.039
anyway yeah 24 7 discord had a couple of

355.28 --> 359.67999999999995
good moments there

357.039 --> 367.84
just roll in there it was kind of silent

359.68 --> 367.84000000000003
i did my thing

368.319 --> 374.8
i don't even remember what it was i just

371.52 --> 377.039
do that i do what i do

374.8 --> 377.039
uh

378.479 --> 383.12
it's no tea time with gary and terry was

380.88 --> 383.12
there

383.44 --> 394.71999999999997
let me scroll through it again

386.56 --> 397.52
no was it no it was an upload

394.72 --> 398.24
right just a little video about them

397.52 --> 401.52
like

398.24 --> 405.6
uh removing

401.52 --> 405.59999999999997
tree stump that's it

406.84 --> 410.0
uh

408.479 --> 411.919
all right so there were other things

410.0 --> 414.24
happening as well but

411.919 --> 416.0
i didn't get to watch that as i didn't

414.24 --> 419.599
go to bed that late although i would

416.0 --> 422.24
yeah it was past 12 again

419.599 --> 422.96
that was again two o'clock right it's

422.24 --> 427.599
like somewhere

422.96 --> 427.599
two o'clock uh

428.0 --> 432.479
also this morning yeah i got a call back

431.44 --> 435.199
from my healer

432.479 --> 438.4
because i did call him was it yes there

435.199 --> 441.84000000000003
was a saturday

438.4 --> 443.67999999999995
but yeah he's just too busy usually

441.84 --> 445.599
he doesn't really take calls in the

443.68 --> 446.88
weekend anyway unless it's like really

445.599 --> 450.0
urgent

446.88 --> 452.8
he's been busy uh so yeah i did a

450.0 --> 452.8
checkup with that

453.039 --> 456.4
and i was doing just fine

457.44 --> 465.759
uh yeah at this point like

460.8 --> 468.8
having him on the phone is now like a

465.759 --> 472.08000000000004
almost like a micro conference because

468.8 --> 475.12
what i worry about what i deal with and

472.08 --> 478.4
german new medicine approach and just

475.12 --> 481.84000000000003
not going along with the system finding

478.4 --> 485.28
that clean path outside of it

481.84 --> 487.44
in the corona situation somehow

485.28 --> 489.52
and at the same time like giving sort of

487.44 --> 492.71999999999997
a forecast

489.52 --> 494.87899999999996
like he is doing that in his own way so

492.72 --> 497.199
when i have him on the line i put down

494.879 --> 500.319
my worries and then he has like

497.199 --> 502.0
a rollout response because yeah he's

500.319 --> 503.03900000000004
thinking about that a lot so it's almost

502.0 --> 506.08
like we get

503.039 --> 507.919
micro conference

506.08 --> 509.12
i'm probably not the only one that he

507.919 --> 511.039
has that with

509.12 --> 512.32
because a lot of people that have

511.039 --> 515.76
connected to him

512.32 --> 518.8000000000001
through his craft uh

515.76 --> 522.0
yeah they're kind of in this same boat

518.8 --> 523.1999999999999
right they're all pretty much german new

522.0 --> 525.76
medicine

523.2 --> 526.88
followers and when you do that then you

525.76 --> 529.4399999999999
literally just

526.88 --> 530.48
stumble into this medical industrial

529.44 --> 532.1600000000001
complex it

530.48 --> 536.5600000000001
you start to see it for what it really

532.16 --> 540.0799999999999
is you lose you see that it's no more

536.56 --> 542.4799999999999
necessity really for most of it and then

540.08 --> 543.36
yeah the realization it's just really

542.48 --> 545.6
corrupting

543.36 --> 547.519
like i had a metaphor this morning that

545.6 --> 550.32
i came up with it's like in

547.519 --> 553.2
an organ that's always supposed to

550.32 --> 556.6400000000001
function that has suddenly gone

553.2 --> 558.5600000000001
necrotic like it's gone diseased

556.64 --> 560.16
like it and it doesn't seem like it's

558.56 --> 563.8389999999999
gonna come back

560.16 --> 563.8389999999999
right not until there is

564.32 --> 571.839
well some surgery done

568.32 --> 574.839
and who knows it might be replaced but

571.839 --> 577.7600000000001
yeah that's going like it's going to be

574.839 --> 582.08
dramatic either way

577.76 --> 582.08
like anyway

582.399 --> 593.2
it's good to have him on the line

590.8 --> 593.1999999999999
right

596.72 --> 603.279
i didn't get up pretty late though

600.08 --> 604.32
yeah he called me no i wasn't that late

603.279 --> 607.12
really

604.32 --> 608.6400000000001
i don't know time just flew this morning

607.12 --> 608.9590000000001
so that's also why i was a little bit

608.64 --> 612.959
late

608.959 --> 613.5189999999999
just maybe it's because i'm a little

612.959 --> 617.1199999999999
more at

613.519 --> 623.04
ease and then time does move by

617.12 --> 623.04
faster doing the same things

623.2 --> 629.0400000000001
right sometimes like when i'm really

626.959 --> 630.959
comfortable i even have to like get a

629.04 --> 634.48
little punishing towards myself

630.959 --> 636.399
just saying like no don't slow it down

634.48 --> 638.0790000000001
get it done get it done quick quick

636.399 --> 641.04
quick and not

638.079 --> 642.399
like overly hurried but just like focus

641.04 --> 646.24
on what needs to be done

642.399 --> 661.12
so you know you can be on time and i

646.24 --> 664.399
haven't been like that this morning

661.12 --> 666.72
hey hello dean wright and chad good to

664.399 --> 666.72
see you

673.12 --> 679.04
but yeah i in my head i am dwelling on

676.079 --> 680.7199999999999
quite some dramatic things

679.04 --> 682.16
that are going to be unfolding in the

680.72 --> 686.48
near future

682.16 --> 689.76
like there's there is like an effective

686.48 --> 692.9590000000001
apocalypse waiting to unfold and when

689.76 --> 696.0
when it truly hits the minds of

692.959 --> 698.959
everybody that's been dragged into it

696.0 --> 699.6
there's going to be a demoralization

698.959 --> 703.5189999999999
spirit

699.6 --> 706.88
that has never been felt before

703.519 --> 708.9590000000001
in these current generations like they

706.88 --> 712.56
are going to be

708.959 --> 715.4399999999999
basically experiencing

712.56 --> 716.88
a sensation that like humanity is doomed

715.44 --> 719.9200000000001
because so many

716.88 --> 720.399
right and they those people don't have

719.92 --> 724.959
no

720.399 --> 727.92
idea how to grasp the bigger picture

724.959 --> 729.8389999999999
so they will just say now everybody's

727.92 --> 732.8
doomed it doesn't matter anymore

729.839 --> 735.44
this is part of my prediction that's

732.8 --> 735.4399999999999
gonna happen

738.24 --> 743.2
oh you would wanna know why i don't like

741.6 --> 746.32
gay people

743.2 --> 750.0
okay well

746.32 --> 752.1600000000001
because i'm not gay and

750.0 --> 753.2
there's been a lot of gay people trying

752.16 --> 757.04
to force

753.2 --> 759.6800000000001
their gayness on me a lot of like

757.04 --> 761.76
lusting over me and that's quite

759.68 --> 764.8
repulsive

761.76 --> 767.76
right when people project

764.8 --> 769.68
[ __ ] on you that is not a part of you

767.76 --> 772.88
then eventually you'll start to hate

769.68 --> 776.079
them for it

772.88 --> 776.079
it's really that simple

782.079 --> 787.8389999999999
right i never liked it though

791.839 --> 798.5600000000001
yeah well black hat is too bad for you

795.12 --> 802.48
i am homophobic yeah clinically

798.56 --> 804.399
yeah i am it's not something i'm ashamed

802.48 --> 807.839
for

804.399 --> 814.72
contrary it's just

807.839 --> 817.44
that's the way it is right

814.72 --> 819.44
so yeah i'm i'm sorry if you have a

817.44 --> 823.0400000000001
problem with that

819.44 --> 826.72
and go [ __ ] yourself

823.04 --> 829.279
don't give a [ __ ] yeah

826.72 --> 830.72
yes so now that i answered your question

829.279 --> 834.16
you can get the [ __ ] out

830.72 --> 834.1600000000001
scumbag bye

838.54 --> 843.279
[Music]

840.72 --> 844.5600000000001
right hello george sanford by the way

843.279 --> 847.67
good to see you

844.56 --> 847.67
[Music]

854.839 --> 859.44
yeah because

856.8 --> 859.92
yeah you can you can just keep on coming

859.44 --> 863.0400000000001
to me

859.92 --> 864.959
and pretending like you got something

863.04 --> 868.16
over me

864.959 --> 871.4399999999999
by telling me

868.16 --> 874.959
are you this you think

871.44 --> 876.9590000000001
that how dare you well go [ __ ] yourself

874.959 --> 879.199
yeah go [ __ ] yourself there's nothing i

876.959 --> 883.3599999999999
can do about it

879.199 --> 887.3599999999999
i i'm not going to try to suppress it

883.36 --> 891.12
so it goes away or something like that

887.36 --> 893.92
or go in some medic psychology altering

891.12 --> 897.519
medication or whatever i'm not gonna do

893.92 --> 899.92
any of that it's the way it is

897.519 --> 900.5600000000001
and if you have a problem with it then

899.92 --> 903.92
get the

900.56 --> 903.92
[ __ ] out of my way

905.04 --> 911.199
it's very simple right

908.8 --> 912.0
now that doesn't mean that if you just

911.199 --> 916.8
happen to be

912.0 --> 919.92
gay that i'm gonna hold that against you

916.8 --> 922.56
right if you're like that that's

919.92 --> 923.36
that's just that's your issue that's

922.56 --> 927.279
your

923.36 --> 931.12
life choices and path that's what you do

927.279 --> 934.16
just don't project it on to me

931.12 --> 936.9590000000001
all right and don't

934.16 --> 937.68
share your gayness with me thank you

936.959 --> 939.5189999999999
very much

937.68 --> 943.199
because i don't care about that i don't

939.519 --> 943.199
want to know anything about that

945.12 --> 954.8
because it repulses me in in

948.48 --> 957.6
different ways

954.8 --> 957.5999999999999
it's that simple

959.279 --> 963.6
right and a lot of people that follow me

961.759 --> 965.6
i think they are gay

963.6 --> 968.0
and that have been commenters and it's

965.6 --> 971.12
okay because they understand they'd

968.0 --> 971.12
understand what it is

971.36 --> 977.839
my feelings my homophobia if you will

975.519 --> 982.32
and they know how to deal with it ah

977.839 --> 984.72
chat froze

982.32 --> 984.72
is it

986.8 --> 989.4399999999999
let me check

994.839 --> 997.839
dude

998.72 --> 1004.639
no i don't think it's frozen though but

1000.959 --> 1008.56
i'm refreshing it anyway there you go

1004.639 --> 1011.839
now it's just that deleted messages and

1008.56 --> 1011.8389999999999
block people don't show up

1014.24 --> 1021.12
no the realm it's not

1017.519 --> 1025.36
concave it's not

1021.12 --> 1027.52
give it up there's no curvature

1025.36 --> 1029.1989999999998
two of your comments didn't pop up did

1027.52 --> 1039.839
they

1029.199 --> 1039.8390000000002
i think they did

1040.079 --> 1043.9189999999999
no i think every message you you put

1042.88 --> 1047.6000000000001
down

1043.919 --> 1048.88
showed up or or maybe you said a couple

1047.6 --> 1052.0
of things that were like

1048.88 --> 1054.96
google banned so that even

1052.0 --> 1057.12
i don't get to see them it's deleted

1054.96 --> 1060.4
before it even hits the main

1057.12 --> 1060.3999999999999
system i don't know

1060.64 --> 1065.1200000000001
it's not showing up to me in in the

1062.88 --> 1068.88
youtube chat either tom parker so

1065.12 --> 1068.8799999999999
whatever try again

1078.84 --> 1081.84
anyway

1093.6 --> 1097.6789999999999
lisa blair i don't know who that is

1101.84 --> 1108.3999999999999
diameter what are you talking about

1105.28 --> 1110.96
fe diameter what diameter

1108.4 --> 1111.679
why are you assuming there's a diameter

1110.96 --> 1114.08
what

1111.679 --> 1115.8400000000001
are you straw manning me with that the

1114.08 --> 1123.84
flat earth is a disk

1115.84 --> 1123.84
are you doing that the realm

1141.84 --> 1151.84
at 40s okay

1163.44 --> 1168.4
a dice i don't even know what that's

1165.6 --> 1168.3999999999999
supposed to mean

1173.52 --> 1179.84
serious hello rocket blimps by the way

1180.16 --> 1182.4
ah

1183.6 --> 1188.32
without the sun it is a little chilly in

1186.0 --> 1188.32
here

1188.88 --> 1193.8400000000001
hope it comes back soon

1202.72 --> 1210.08
so yeah how is everybody in chat doing

1206.4 --> 1210.0800000000002
today on this monday

1210.559 --> 1221.84
did you guys all have a good weekend

1232.84 --> 1235.84
so

1267.76 --> 1272.1589999999999
if well well the realm those are some

1271.2 --> 1275.52
really

1272.159 --> 1277.679
big jumps and assumption there

1275.52 --> 1280.0
lisa blair proved antarctic as a limit

1277.679 --> 1280.64
circumference circumference so how does

1280.0 --> 1284.96
that work

1280.64 --> 1287.679
circumference you mean the ice wall it

1284.96 --> 1290.4
has a limited length until you

1287.679 --> 1292.5590000000002
return back to the starting point that's

1290.4 --> 1296.159
really interesting

1292.559 --> 1299.76
so does that prove

1296.159 --> 1302.159
it's a ring does it prove it's a disc

1299.76 --> 1303.52
or was it actually just a wall a

1302.159 --> 1307.679
straight line wall

1303.52 --> 1312.24
right these things are are rigorously

1307.679 --> 1316.4
left out of the data

1312.24 --> 1320.32
all right so it doesn't prove anything

1316.4 --> 1320.3200000000002
about the orientation of the realm

1321.52 --> 1328.1589999999999
until you get that extra data

1324.799 --> 1331.679
until you get a mapping

1328.159 --> 1334.64
of the all the angles like the

1331.679 --> 1335.2
the euclidean angles that have been

1334.64 --> 1338.7990000000002
taken

1335.2 --> 1342.88
during the travel across

1338.799 --> 1347.36
antarctica past it past the ice wall

1342.88 --> 1350.7990000000002
right so you can get a map of literal

1347.36 --> 1350.799
angles being taken

1351.28 --> 1354.799
so that when they return at the starting

1353.76 --> 1356.96
point

1354.799 --> 1359.039
assuming they all went in in the

1356.96 --> 1360.64
singular direction and not just back and

1359.039 --> 1364.559
forth like most

1360.64 --> 1367.679
travels past the ice wall thus far

1364.559 --> 1370.72
then yeah you can figure out

1367.679 --> 1374.0800000000002
what do the angles add up to

1370.72 --> 1377.039
right it's that simple simple data data

1374.08 --> 1379.6
you need to know to understand what

1377.039 --> 1389.84
antarctica even is

1379.6 --> 1389.84
in the realm

1398.88 --> 1406.0800000000002
orlando ferguson map no

1402.64 --> 1409.2
well maybe i've seen it come past

1406.08 --> 1409.1999999999998
some point could be

1410.88 --> 1417.8400000000001
you've traced all the flights down south

1414.84 --> 1417.84
okay

1420.72 --> 1424.32
but antarctica race well antarctica

1423.679 --> 1427.679
races

1424.32 --> 1430.799
as far as i know are back and forth

1427.679 --> 1433.8400000000001
yeah that that's the whole point

1430.799 --> 1438.32
with the flights it's back and forth the

1433.84 --> 1438.32
the boat races it's back and forth

1438.559 --> 1445.84
so yeah how do you explain that

1442.24 --> 1445.84
why don't they just

1446.64 --> 1451.2
go in one direction until they end up

1449.039 --> 1452.24
where they started why don't they just

1451.2 --> 1456.88
do that then

1452.24 --> 1456.88
why do they keep going back and forth

1457.279 --> 1461.76
not lisa blair okay if you say so man

1465.12 --> 1470.32
yeah frosty go [ __ ] yourself you [ __ ]

1467.44 --> 1473.1200000000001
piece of [ __ ] i don't give a [ __ ]

1470.32 --> 1473.76
if your sister is gay i don't know your

1473.12 --> 1478.1589999999999
sister

1473.76 --> 1480.48
your sister is your problem yeah

1478.159 --> 1481.679
i don't give a [ __ ] what you think about

1480.48 --> 1484.48
it

1481.679 --> 1485.44
if you are anti-homophobic you can go

1484.48 --> 1488.48
kill yourself

1485.44 --> 1491.679
scumbag communist piece of [ __ ]

1488.48 --> 1494.24
i don't give a [ __ ] i don't give a [ __ ]

1491.679 --> 1495.6000000000001
what you think about how i feel about

1494.24 --> 1499.039
gay people

1495.6 --> 1502.48
right i'm not depriving them of

1499.039 --> 1503.12
life or rights or anything i just want

1502.48 --> 1506.88
them

1503.12 --> 1510.559
to leave me alone with their gayness

1506.88 --> 1512.5590000000002
that is it yeah scumbag

1510.559 --> 1515.2
you're not gonna force me to live in a

1512.559 --> 1529.84
gay world you got that scumbag

1515.2 --> 1529.8400000000001
go [ __ ] yourself

1532.03 --> 1536.8999999999999
[Music]

1540.4 --> 1545.2
they do check them i don't trust you man

1543.6 --> 1546.559
i don't know who you are you say you're

1545.2 --> 1548.799
a map maker

1546.559 --> 1550.3999999999999
and you say you're a concaver it sounds

1548.799 --> 1553.2
like you're

1550.4 --> 1554.88
a liar and a fantasist and i'm probably

1553.2 --> 1558.96
gonna ban you because

1554.88 --> 1558.96
you're just misinformation placement

1561.52 --> 1564.799
because you don't sound like a map maker

1563.36 --> 1568.0
at all you haven't

1564.799 --> 1570.6399999999999
proved that you actually are

1568.0 --> 1572.0
because if you were you would be

1570.64 --> 1575.679
relaying

1572.0 --> 1576.559
a certain quality of data that you have

1575.679 --> 1585.8400000000001
not shown

1576.559 --> 1585.84
at all so i think you're a liar

1592.48 --> 1596.96
promise i'm not well you don't have to

1594.72 --> 1599.039
promise why don't you just prove it

1596.96 --> 1600.96
why don't you prove it that you're an

1599.039 --> 1604.48
actual map maker

1600.96 --> 1607.919
why don't you relate some terminologies

1604.48 --> 1613.52
that you must know if you are right why

1607.919 --> 1616.5590000000002
don't you prove that you are

1613.52 --> 1619.76
show me your knowledge show me what it

1616.559 --> 1619.76
is to be a map maker

1624.72 --> 1630.88
yeah dean right i think you're right

1628.48 --> 1631.679
because what map maker in their right

1630.88 --> 1635.3600000000001
mind would

1631.679 --> 1640.88
would declare they're a concaver

1635.36 --> 1643.1999999999998
that's ridiculous

1640.88 --> 1643.2
dude

1653.279 --> 1657.2
what are map makers called well he's not

1655.6 --> 1660.799
even going to get into that

1657.2 --> 1664.32
right i know what it is i know

1660.799 --> 1667.52
right it's called cartography

1664.32 --> 1670.32
yeah cartography yeah

1667.52 --> 1670.8799999999999
i know that and i'm not a map maker

1670.32 --> 1672.8799999999999
right

1670.88 --> 1674.3200000000002
but i have people that are actually

1672.88 --> 1676.159
interested in that sort of thing and

1674.32 --> 1679.36
then you pick up

1676.159 --> 1681.919
on certain details where do people

1679.36 --> 1683.84
typically focus just like i recognize

1681.919 --> 1685.919
when somebody's a programmer

1683.84 --> 1687.36
versus when somebody pretends to be a

1685.919 --> 1688.7990000000002
programmer even though i'm not a

1687.36 --> 1691.6
programmer

1688.799 --> 1693.2
i know these things because that is part

1691.6 --> 1696.559
of my expertise

1693.2 --> 1699.679
right psychoanalysis

1696.559 --> 1703.9189999999999
inquisitor figuring out and

1699.679 --> 1707.52
rooting the truth right getting it

1703.919 --> 1707.5200000000002
in plain sight that's what i do

1707.84 --> 1713.6789999999999
right and i don't have a paper for that

1709.6 --> 1724.559
it's called a life dedication

1713.679 --> 1726.48
god-given mission

1724.559 --> 1728.72
right yeah dutch sailor lee's already

1726.48 --> 1729.89
out of here oh it's a blabbermouthing

1728.72 --> 1735.76
idiot

1729.89 --> 1741.44
[Music]

1735.76 --> 1741.44
bird is misquoted by flirts no he's not

1742.08 --> 1746.4399999999998
he's not

1743.32 --> 1746.4399999999998
[Music]

1746.64 --> 1752.3990000000001
everything we got from him is on video

1749.76 --> 1754.64
so there's no misquotations there i've

1752.399 --> 1756.2399999999998
rarely heard anybody misquote

1754.64 --> 1757.8400000000001
okay there might be flat earth there's

1756.24 --> 1760.88
like superficial

1757.84 --> 1763.36
flat earthers they'll say oh unrule bird

1760.88 --> 1764.24
proof the earth is flat or sad the earth

1763.36 --> 1767.4399999999998
is flat yeah

1764.24 --> 1770.72
he probably didn't say that

1767.44 --> 1775.1200000000001
and to say he proved that is kind of

1770.72 --> 1781.679
like reaching it right agreed to that

1775.12 --> 1784.399
but nobody's like misquoting him

1781.679 --> 1786.88
they're just overreaching in their train

1784.399 --> 1786.8799999999999
of thinking

1792.159 --> 1795.8400000000001
he was a freemason no doubt

1809.44 --> 1813.279
bird tells the truth it is not liked by

1811.679 --> 1816.5590000000002
bald earth or trolls

1813.279 --> 1819.36
well he tells the truth

1816.559 --> 1821.52
no it's you can't even actually

1819.36 --> 1823.6789999999999
completely prove that that he is telling

1821.52 --> 1828.48
the truth no but what he did

1823.679 --> 1832.0
was break the image

1828.48 --> 1833.2
right he stepped outside of the normal

1832.0 --> 1836.32
narrative

1833.2 --> 1839.2
system that's what he did

1836.32 --> 1840.6399999999999
and that's really what makes balder so

1839.2 --> 1843.6000000000001
nervous because he kind of like

1840.64 --> 1846.0800000000002
testified to things that shouldn't exist

1843.6 --> 1847.76
according to the ball earth right that's

1846.08 --> 1851.12
what they don't like about him he didn't

1847.76 --> 1854.559
prove the earth is flat

1851.12 --> 1856.8799999999999
there's no conclusive evidence that

1854.559 --> 1858.32
he did actually encounter the things

1856.88 --> 1860.3990000000001
that he said

1858.32 --> 1861.9189999999999
right where's the footage where's the

1860.399 --> 1864.399
where's the samples

1861.919 --> 1865.76
the physical samples that he took and

1864.399 --> 1868.2399999999998
took back with him to show

1865.76 --> 1870.1589999999999
like oh look here's a pile of pure

1868.24 --> 1870.64
uranium here's a pile of pure iron

1870.159 --> 1873.919
here's

1870.64 --> 1875.279
pure coal see no he didn't do that so

1873.919 --> 1878.72
it's very likely he

1875.279 --> 1881.039
also kind of gave an ex tried to

1878.72 --> 1882.96
kick-start an incentive to start

1881.039 --> 1885.039
exploring beyond the poles

1882.96 --> 1887.3600000000001
and he probably wanted it as a like a

1885.039 --> 1890.72
public race thing so he tried

1887.36 --> 1893.84
to culturally world influence

1890.72 --> 1896.64
outside of the globe narrative right

1893.84 --> 1897.12
that's what he did that's something

1896.64 --> 1899.8400000000001
that's

1897.12 --> 1900.799
very likely to be the complete picture

1899.84 --> 1903.12
right

1900.799 --> 1904.8799999999999
doesn't mean that he wasn't lying

1903.12 --> 1907.279
because it could have been a lie

1904.88 --> 1908.0800000000002
he could have overblown it he could have

1907.279 --> 1912.24
just

1908.08 --> 1916.24
suspected that it was there preliminary

1912.24 --> 1919.2
and try to incentivize the public

1916.24 --> 1920.24
to push exploring it to see whether it's

1919.2 --> 1935.8400000000001
actually there

1920.24 --> 1935.84
all that that is much more likely

1941.6 --> 1949.84
uh no rocket blimps that's [ __ ]

1952.32 --> 1956.1589999999999
no carbon monoxide poisoning doesn't

1954.399 --> 1958.4799999999998
make you loopy it just

1956.159 --> 1960.0800000000002
gives you like concentration problems

1958.48 --> 1963.84
and [ __ ]

1960.08 --> 1963.84
doesn't make you psychotic

1968.64 --> 1972.5590000000002
and besides if you actually was

1970.48 --> 1974.0
psychotic to that level that he lost

1972.559 --> 1976.799
oversight then

1974.0 --> 1977.84
the signs would be very telling

1976.799 --> 1981.76
constantly

1977.84 --> 1984.6
he would have ticks and [ __ ] right

1981.76 --> 1986.799
like on camera and he did he didn't

1984.6 --> 1989.519
[Music]

1986.799 --> 1990.08
although pretty sure he has just was

1989.519 --> 1992.48
probably

1990.08 --> 1993.84
very nervous because he knew he was

1992.48 --> 1996.72
trying to basically

1993.84 --> 1998.0
wield the world narrative against the

1996.72 --> 2000.3990000000001
main plan

1998.0 --> 2002.799
so it's very likely he was under a great

2000.399 --> 2005.76
deal attention

2002.799 --> 2006.6399999999999
right to explain any weird stance he

2005.76 --> 2009.679
might have had

2006.64 --> 2011.8400000000001
because he knew what he was doing so he

2009.679 --> 2014.24
must have been nervous as [ __ ]

2011.84 --> 2016.32
and he was a guy with with nerves of

2014.24 --> 2019.84
steel right but there's only so much

2016.32 --> 2019.84
even steel nerves can take

2020.0 --> 2026.159
he was trying a big thing and it

2022.96 --> 2026.159
probably got him killed

2027.039 --> 2030.799
and he probably even knew that

2031.2 --> 2033.8400000000001
all right anyway

2034.32 --> 2047.84
mars helicopter success this is

2037.919 --> 2047.8400000000001
right that's hilarious

2051.599 --> 2057.76
all right not all masons are bad well

2055.119 --> 2057.76
may since

2058.48 --> 2063.679
yeah get into dubious stuff and there's

2061.44 --> 2066.159
a lot of conspiracies going on

2063.679 --> 2068.56
with the masons and a lot of it is dark

2066.159 --> 2070.48
but yeah it is up to the mason as an

2068.56 --> 2073.919
individual

2070.48 --> 2076.48
to either become part of the conspiracy

2073.919 --> 2079.7599999999998
power structure or to indeed

2076.48 --> 2082.879
be kind of more solitary

2079.76 --> 2082.8790000000004
and do the opposite

2084.72 --> 2089.839
it's a little complicated

2098.56 --> 2102.16
right but with the freemasons choice is

2101.839 --> 2106.64
like

2102.16 --> 2110.3199999999997
really important and respected

2106.64 --> 2110.72
right what is not respected is people

2110.32 --> 2112.56
that

2110.72 --> 2114.48
literally don't know what they're doing

2112.56 --> 2115.2
and that are following a vague feeling

2114.48 --> 2116.56
without

2115.2 --> 2118.16
actually understanding what they're

2116.56 --> 2119.52
engaging in that's what they do not

2118.16 --> 2122.7999999999997
respect

2119.52 --> 2123.2
from what i got in my life experiences

2122.8 --> 2131.8390000000004
with

2123.2 --> 2131.839
with them

2136.32 --> 2143.599
right but who knows how diverse

2140.16 --> 2147.92
the mason cultures are might be

2143.599 --> 2147.92
extremely decentralized for all i know

2149.839 --> 2153.2
although it seems like it is exactly the

2152.16 --> 2156.24
opposite

2153.2 --> 2159.1189999999997
i don't know i look i i have not

2156.24 --> 2162.16
i don't have like public contacts with

2159.119 --> 2162.1600000000003
freemasons or

2162.64 --> 2170.24
all that my grandfather was a freemason

2166.72 --> 2173.839
that i've never met just figured it out

2170.24 --> 2173.839
afterward after we heard he died

2174.48 --> 2182.2400000000002
and through his acquaintances who were

2178.88 --> 2184.48
blatantly freemasons like yeah i did

2182.24 --> 2186.0
like sort of touch upon it a little and

2184.48 --> 2190.2400000000002
i'm pretty sure there was

2186.0 --> 2190.24
spirit journey contact as well

2190.4 --> 2196.2400000000002
pretty sure about that so yeah

2193.68 --> 2198.3199999999997
in the spirit world i've been all over

2196.24 --> 2201.68
freemasonry

2198.32 --> 2205.44
like all over it that's also

2201.68 --> 2208.16
why i have this i guess odd attitude

2205.44 --> 2209.52
on average where i just say yeah 33 yeah

2208.16 --> 2212.0
it's mine

2209.52 --> 2214.72
oh oh it's evil no that's just you being

2212.0 --> 2218.56
stupid and not understanding any of it

2214.72 --> 2223.52
i claim it individually

2218.56 --> 2223.52
i claim it i take its power

2226.839 --> 2229.839
mine

2233.76 --> 2243.8390000000004
all right

2251.599 --> 2255.52
birds accounts of the north are much

2254.0 --> 2257.68
more interesting than south

2255.52 --> 2259.599
i've heard very little about that george

2257.68 --> 2262.56
sanford

2259.599 --> 2265.3590000000004
what was that about eric dubay's

2262.56 --> 2269.2
grandfather was a freemason oh dear

2265.359 --> 2270.96
really okay

2269.2 --> 2273.5989999999997
well i think that probably a lot of

2270.96 --> 2276.56
people somewhere in the family have some

2273.599 --> 2280.1600000000003
kind of a freemason

2276.56 --> 2285.2
right in europe and the united states

2280.16 --> 2288.3199999999997
and probably a lot of other places too

2285.2 --> 2288.3199999999997
asian countries and

2288.56 --> 2292.7999999999997
and i think there's there in the middle

2290.24 --> 2295.7599999999998
east too or they have their own type of

2292.8 --> 2312.079
version i don't know

2295.76 --> 2314.5600000000004
but freemasons are very widespread

2312.079 --> 2314.5600000000004
anyway

2320.64 --> 2330.0
tropical lands in the north

2325.599 --> 2332.1600000000003
wow are you sure he didn't just mean the

2330.0 --> 2333.839
the slightly warmer regions because

2332.16 --> 2336.0789999999997
there is like this

2333.839 --> 2337.599
oscillation in the temperature for some

2336.079 --> 2340.1600000000003
reason

2337.599 --> 2342.48
where first it gets really cold and icy

2340.16 --> 2345.44
and then suddenly there's like a

2342.48 --> 2348.56
a dip and then it's actually quite

2345.44 --> 2348.56
moderate and pleasant

2349.44 --> 2355.839
and then after that i don't know

2352.72 --> 2356.3199999999997
there's like islands north of europe and

2355.839 --> 2359.359
all that

2356.32 --> 2361.599
i think it's like russian and norwegian

2359.359 --> 2365.359
and some of them are actually not

2361.599 --> 2365.3590000000004
completely frozen up all the time

2366.48 --> 2372.8
so yeah who knows but tropical seems it

2369.599 --> 2372.8
seems a bit extreme

2374.4 --> 2378.32
he must have then gone pretty far

2378.4 --> 2383.76
hey who knows maybe he went to the next

2380.32 --> 2386.88
realm segment you know could be

2383.76 --> 2389.599
hey john bernards hey dude

2386.88 --> 2390.079
are you the john bernard that i talked

2389.599 --> 2394.839
to

2390.079 --> 2397.8390000000004
yesterday on flat earth discord was that

2394.839 --> 2397.839
you

2404.96 --> 2411.76
tropical lands are in the tropics right

2408.0 --> 2415.119
well constant chips uh

2411.76 --> 2417.0400000000004
if there's other realms beyond ah okay

2415.119 --> 2418.7200000000003
good to know then i know what your voice

2417.04 --> 2422.8
is like now all right

2418.72 --> 2426.3999999999996
cool but yeah there may be tropics

2422.8 --> 2429.8390000000004
beyond the north right just look into my

2426.4 --> 2433.04
rectangular looping model setups

2429.839 --> 2436.64
there's very yeah in that there's no

2433.04 --> 2439.119
real objection from a cosmogeny

2436.64 --> 2442.64
standpoint in my view

2439.119 --> 2445.04
that would exclude other realm segments

2442.64 --> 2448.8799999999997
from existing

2445.04 --> 2451.2799999999997
south and potentially even north

2448.88 --> 2452.079
at least one like that we would be the

2451.28 --> 2453.8390000000004
middle earth

2452.079 --> 2455.52
realm and that there's a northern

2453.839 --> 2457.599
segment and a southern segment

2455.52 --> 2459.359
their own realms who knows how big they

2457.599 --> 2461.44
are they might be as big as this realm

2459.359 --> 2463.44
or they might be smaller

2461.44 --> 2465.599
or who knows southern realm might even

2463.44 --> 2468.319
be bigger who knows

2465.599 --> 2469.119
i don't know how big that realm segment

2468.319 --> 2472.4
would those

2469.119 --> 2475.6800000000003
realm segments would be and

2472.4 --> 2478.8
potentially even more beyond

2475.68 --> 2480.56
right instead of three

2478.8 --> 2482.319
realm segments in which we are the

2480.56 --> 2486.24
middle one there might be

2482.319 --> 2489.52
33. you know let's just get a little

2486.24 --> 2491.7599999999998
numerology occultish who knows it could

2489.52 --> 2491.7599999999998
be

2491.92 --> 2500.319
there's nothing that absolutely excluded

2497.28 --> 2503.52
right i don't think that

2500.319 --> 2506.8
admiral byrd actually basically got to

2503.52 --> 2509.68
the point where he said yes

2506.8 --> 2511.2000000000003
i bumped into the dome it's up to here

2509.68 --> 2515.7599999999998
and no further

2511.2 --> 2515.7599999999998
nothing like that right

2516.88 --> 2519.92
so who knows how many realm segments

2518.96 --> 2524.8
there are

2519.92 --> 2524.8
beyond the north and south in this realm

2529.76 --> 2532.7200000000003
hey david reed

2533.2 --> 2537.839
classic arwin

2539.28 --> 2545.6800000000003
i claim to be a witch

2542.56 --> 2547.52
well sorry but i definitely weigh more

2545.68 --> 2551.839
than a duck

2547.52 --> 2551.839
lumpy gas in a vacuum

2570.64 --> 2579.68
who knows inanna snow

2573.839 --> 2579.68
never heard of him her take it sir

2591.359 --> 2594.96
right yeah but george sanford about that

2594.319 --> 2597.839
that

2594.96 --> 2600.079
thing his plane getting taken out where

2597.839 --> 2601.7599999999998
did he say that was that part of like an

2600.079 --> 2603.44
interview too or is that something he

2601.76 --> 2605.92
wrote down in a book

2603.44 --> 2606.56
because i i must have slipped yeah that

2605.92 --> 2610.079
must have

2606.56 --> 2613.2
passed me by i don't remember having

2610.079 --> 2613.2000000000003
heard him say that

2613.28 --> 2616.7200000000003
maybe it was another interview

2617.44 --> 2621.839
george sanford

2622.319 --> 2635.839
oh well

2643.839 --> 2649.839
in his diaries all right

2655.52 --> 2659.52
right well it could be man could very

2658.4 --> 2663.6800000000003
well be

2659.52 --> 2667.04
that there is like a

2663.68 --> 2670.3999999999996
another empire at the north

2667.04 --> 2670.96
like like we are this world empire this

2670.4 --> 2674.319
realms

2670.96 --> 2677.599
empire of satan delusions and lies and

2674.319 --> 2680.72
disgusting [ __ ] self-destruction

2677.599 --> 2681.3590000000004
poison and who knows there might be a

2680.72 --> 2683.5989999999997
purer

2681.359 --> 2686.0789999999997
empire to the north and who knows that

2683.599 --> 2687.44
they originally did relate even to the

2686.079 --> 2690.8
nazis or something

2687.44 --> 2693.359
occultly right might have been

2690.8 --> 2694.5600000000004
that hitler was inspired partially by

2693.359 --> 2696.88
them or contact

2694.56 --> 2700.16
you can go in all kinds of like

2696.88 --> 2703.28
conspiracy theory directions with this

2700.16 --> 2708.0
wouldn't be surprised if

2703.28 --> 2711.1600000000003
that well empire would still be there

2708.0 --> 2712.72
and would have probably even developed

2711.16 --> 2716.0789999999997
simultaneously

2712.72 --> 2718.319
so they might have you could say

2716.079 --> 2719.28
what is presumed to be deep state level

2718.319 --> 2721.44
technology

2719.28 --> 2722.3190000000004
secret like 80 years ahead of everything

2721.44 --> 2724.96
well

2722.319 --> 2726.56
it's very likely that well if there is

2724.96 --> 2728.64
an empire to the north that

2726.56 --> 2732.7999999999997
at the time could literally remote

2728.64 --> 2735.44
control down a plane

2732.8 --> 2736.6400000000003
that they have quite sophisticated

2735.44 --> 2739.839
technology

2736.64 --> 2739.839
and that they're in control

2741.359 --> 2744.96
over there at least and they're just

2743.04 --> 2748.4
keeping it to themselves

2744.96 --> 2750.48
just letting maybe letting earth

2748.4 --> 2752.0
our realm the middle earth letting it

2750.48 --> 2761.839
sweat it letting us

2752.0 --> 2761.839
sweat it out

2762.16 --> 2766.24
didn't he say there was nothing left to

2764.16 --> 2770.7999999999997
explore in the north

2766.24 --> 2770.7999999999997
okay the iron city

2772.839 --> 2775.839
what

2800.72 --> 2805.359
yeah israel hernandez

2805.599 --> 2809.6800000000003
yeah the south definitely had

2809.92 --> 2817.839
america-sized continents according to

2812.0 --> 2817.839
admiral byrd

2819.52 --> 2823.92
was the name of the city in the outer

2822.48 --> 2827.44
world really

2823.92 --> 2830.48
it had a name the iron city series

2827.44 --> 2832.88
is that all big like in admiral bird's

2830.48 --> 2832.88
journal

2833.599 --> 2837.04
maybe i should read that thing

2838.16 --> 2845.839
does sound pretty interesting but i've

2840.559 --> 2845.8390000000004
never heard of that before

2862.0 --> 2864.4
really

2866.4 --> 2870.839
situation getting crazy in india in what

2868.88 --> 2887.839
sense there

2870.839 --> 2887.839
306. welcome to the chat

2895.119 --> 2899.119
the cove it knows okay so what is

2897.44 --> 2901.839
getting crazy about it because

2899.119 --> 2903.6800000000003
the covet news is always completely

2901.839 --> 2905.7599999999998
[ __ ] insane and makes no damn

2903.68 --> 2907.359
sense and is literally just trying to

2905.76 --> 2909.0400000000004
mind control people into killing

2907.359 --> 2912.72
themselves

2909.04 --> 2913.44
and others right massive propaganda

2912.72 --> 2916.48
continues

2913.44 --> 2918.8
okay so it's nothing new then because

2916.48 --> 2920.079
it is crazy it's not getting crazy it is

2918.8 --> 2922.8
crazy it's gonna stay

2920.079 --> 2923.599
crazy for a while right until there's

2922.8 --> 2926.88
just

2923.599 --> 2928.6400000000003
people gonna die that are actually

2926.88 --> 2932.48
spouting out this propaganda

2928.64 --> 2932.48
and then something might alter

2933.76 --> 2939.2000000000003
until then it's just gonna continue

2935.68 --> 2939.2
until everybody's dead

2941.44 --> 2946.48
because they're not going to stop until

2943.52 --> 2946.48
they get killed

2975.359 --> 2982.319
antarctica is bigger than usa uh

2979.839 --> 2983.359
you mean according to the globe model or

2982.319 --> 2999.839
according to

2983.359 --> 2999.839
admiral byrd

3005.04 --> 3008.079
another lockdown

3010.48 --> 3013.839
all right

3018.64 --> 3024.48
any antivir what nobody's being forced

3021.44 --> 3026.559
to take it rocket blimps

3024.48 --> 3030.2400000000002
can can you name me one person that i

3026.559 --> 3030.2400000000002
was actually forced to take it

3030.72 --> 3036.5589999999997
like under threat

3033.839 --> 3036.5589999999997
direct threat

3037.44 --> 3042.7200000000003
or was it just like oh you gotta take it

3040.559 --> 3046.6400000000003
now or we're going to fire you

3042.72 --> 3046.64
right because that's not the same thing

3048.16 --> 3055.839
for work well there you go so

3051.28 --> 3055.8390000000004
that's not being forced

3056.48 --> 3060.48
yeah it's highly unreasonable

3060.64 --> 3064.16
right but that's what a diseased society

3063.52 --> 3065.92
is

3064.16 --> 3068.0
it's highly unreasonable doesn't mean

3065.92 --> 3071.2000000000003
you're being forced now being forced is

3068.0 --> 3076.16
literally not having a choice even

3071.2 --> 3078.96
just trying to basically survive right

3076.16 --> 3079.68
and basically trying to survive does it

3078.96 --> 3083.04
mean oh

3079.68 --> 3085.7599999999998
i gotta ensure that

3083.04 --> 3086.72
all the riches i've gathered and all the

3085.76 --> 3090.3190000000004
authority

3086.72 --> 3092.8799999999997
and all the houses and all investments

3090.319 --> 3095.599
that are gonna retain them so i'm taking

3092.88 --> 3099.839
the facts right that's not being forced

3095.599 --> 3111.839
right that's being seduced

3099.839 --> 3111.839
it's not the same

3131.44 --> 3140.16
it is now being done under duress

3135.52 --> 3140.16
what what does it what is being done

3144.88 --> 3148.8
right because as soon as any any form of

3148.079 --> 3151.599
government

3148.8 --> 3152.079
is literally going to say you must take

3151.599 --> 3155.599
it

3152.079 --> 3156.1600000000003
just you must right you don't have a

3155.599 --> 3158.2400000000002
choice

3156.16 --> 3159.2799999999997
you we're not letting you out of your

3158.24 --> 3163.2799999999997
house to buy

3159.28 --> 3168.3190000000004
food if you don't have that's the moment

3163.28 --> 3170.4
where by natural law their outlaws

3168.319 --> 3171.359
the people in control and they can

3170.4 --> 3174.88
legally be

3171.359 --> 3178.64
assassinated you understand that

3174.88 --> 3180.48
legally because they are overstepping a

3178.64 --> 3184.7999999999997
boundary that under

3180.48 --> 3184.8
and no condition whatsoever

3185.92 --> 3190.2400000000002
they can ever over overstep that

3187.92 --> 3193.44
boundary right

3190.24 --> 3197.1189999999997
there's no justification even

3193.44 --> 3198.16
imaginable that could allow them to do

3197.119 --> 3201.28
that

3198.16 --> 3204.16
under no condition ever right

3201.28 --> 3207.92
so when they actually do that actually

3204.16 --> 3209.92
start to force people that have nothing

3207.92 --> 3213.2000000000003
to lose

3209.92 --> 3213.44
out there cornering them off and forcing

3213.2 --> 3215.839
it

3213.44 --> 3216.839
that's the moment where they can be

3215.839 --> 3220.16
legally

3216.839 --> 3221.7599999999998
assassinated and they probably

3220.16 --> 3223.68
are aware of this and that's why it's

3221.76 --> 3224.559
not really happening they're just trying

3223.68 --> 3228.16
to bluff

3224.559 --> 3230.88
and seduce everyone into taking it

3228.16 --> 3232.7999999999997
literally sacrificing the integrity of

3230.88 --> 3236.1600000000003
the entire society

3232.8 --> 3236.8
that they wield in the process they

3236.16 --> 3238.72
can't

3236.8 --> 3250.1000000000004
actually force it because then they can

3238.72 --> 3253.29
be legally assassinated

3250.1 --> 3253.29
[Music]

3270.559 --> 3273.8390000000004
well agm well i wish them the best of

3273.119 --> 3276.48
luck because

3273.839 --> 3278.24
if if they do anything like that then

3276.48 --> 3280.72
the people

3278.24 --> 3282.24
can either surrender and [ __ ] die

3280.72 --> 3286.48
like pieces of [ __ ]

3282.24 --> 3293.2
wussies or they can pick up their guns

3286.48 --> 3295.44
and kill them

3293.2 --> 3295.4399999999996
right

3297.44 --> 3303.839
so yeah it's all oh you must too

3300.72 --> 3307.52
you must no no that's you buying

3303.839 --> 3309.7599999999998
into the fair spell oh i'm going to be

3307.52 --> 3312.079
forced i'm going to be forced

3309.76 --> 3314.6400000000003
no they can't do it because if they do

3312.079 --> 3318.0
they can be legally assassinated

3314.64 --> 3321.52
do you understand stop buying

3318.0 --> 3326.88
into the spill stop drowning

3321.52 --> 3326.88
into the spell being cast

3328.559 --> 3332.2400000000002
that's right agm forced vaccines go

3331.2 --> 3334.3999999999996
against the normal

3332.24 --> 3336.799
code that's right and that's why i'm

3334.4 --> 3338.96
saying if they actually do that

3336.799 --> 3340.0
it doesn't matter they don't need a

3338.96 --> 3342.7200000000003
lawyer

3340.0 --> 3343.52
to point it out afterward the moment

3342.72 --> 3346.8799999999997
they do it

3343.52 --> 3349.52
they can be legally assassinated

3346.88 --> 3351.839
looking forward to it looking forward to

3349.52 --> 3356.24
some [ __ ] scumbags in government

3351.839 --> 3359.2799999999997
somewhere trying that out and then splat

3356.24 --> 3359.2799999999997
and then the media is oh

3360.72 --> 3364.64
yeah looking forward to that

3368.72 --> 3373.2
because she can't do that all they can

3371.76 --> 3376.2400000000002
do

3373.2 --> 3379.9199999999996
is bluff and

3376.24 --> 3383.04
mind control seduce

3379.92 --> 3383.839
people into thinking they have to take

3383.04 --> 3387.92
it

3383.839 --> 3391.68
do you understand and as soon as they

3387.92 --> 3394.079
move past that into actual forcing it on

3391.68 --> 3394.0789999999997
people

3394.24 --> 3405.839
other than by seduction or mind control

3398.0 --> 3405.839
they can't be legally assassinated

3412.64 --> 3418.72
then the new president of italy is

3414.24 --> 3420.8799999999997
already dead well there probably

3418.72 --> 3423.04
he's probably gonna have like his

3420.88 --> 3424.7200000000003
private little army trying to protect

3423.04 --> 3427.44
him

3424.72 --> 3433.839
but yeah i don't know i don't think

3427.44 --> 3433.839
that's gonna stop a drone strike

3434.76 --> 3438.0190000000002
[Music]

3441.82 --> 3445.599
[Music]

3443.04 --> 3447.359
right because whoever actually does it

3445.599 --> 3449.3590000000004
at that point

3447.359 --> 3450.64
whether they're in a secret service or

3449.359 --> 3453.2799999999997
military or

3450.64 --> 3453.2799999999997
wherever

3454.88 --> 3461.76
like that's they have nothing to lose

3458.559 --> 3465.0400000000004
because it's legal it's literally the

3461.76 --> 3467.119
nazis doing power grab stuff

3465.04 --> 3468.24
when they do that breaking the nuremberg

3467.119 --> 3472.839
coil

3468.24 --> 3476.3999999999996
and consider you could even consider

3472.839 --> 3479.68
that people are obligated

3476.4 --> 3482.319
to do that right something

3479.68 --> 3484.0789999999997
we've kind of forgotten in the last half

3482.319 --> 3486.359
century

3484.079 --> 3487.52
that when somebody does that you're

3486.359 --> 3492.0
obligated

3487.52 --> 3494.319
to stop them if you could otherwise

3492.0 --> 3495.839
you're going to be addressed you had

3494.319 --> 3499.44
that option to do that

3495.839 --> 3502.24
afterward why didn't you do that

3499.44 --> 3502.88
right you're gonna have a problem if you

3502.24 --> 3506.8799999999997
don't

3502.88 --> 3517.359
stop something that you have the duty

3506.88 --> 3520.4
to stop

3517.359 --> 3524.16
has there ever been legal assassination

3520.4 --> 3526.319
well during war because that's what it

3524.16 --> 3526.319
is

3527.44 --> 3531.839
that's the point

3544.88 --> 3551.599
yes i have looked into eric dollar

3548.16 --> 3553.1189999999997
joey not deeply but yeah he's been

3551.599 --> 3559.839
around for a while he has some

3553.119 --> 3559.839
interesting things to say

3561.839 --> 3566.0
now you can change the subject if you

3563.68 --> 3569.359
like i don't really like talking about

3566.0 --> 3569.839
like that just that high action bloody

3569.359 --> 3573.7599999999998
[ __ ]

3569.839 --> 3575.68
i like again i'm not afraid to i just

3573.76 --> 3579.28
don't like it

3575.68 --> 3581.2799999999997
right i just

3579.28 --> 3583.119
have the attitude can somebody please

3581.28 --> 3586.4
just get it over with

3583.119 --> 3590.1600000000003
just get him out i don't want to

3586.4 --> 3593.52
like oh i want to see it all happen

3590.16 --> 3596.0789999999997
oh i'm gonna watch the tv as the war

3593.52 --> 3598.16
breaks out and see things blowing up and

3596.079 --> 3599.52
oh look at all the buildings i hate that

3598.16 --> 3615.839
[ __ ]

3599.52 --> 3615.839
i don't like that i just want resolve

3618.16 --> 3622.319
sun is a converter it's not burning

3620.559 --> 3626.6400000000003
anything right yeah

3622.319 --> 3630.319
eric dollar did actually uh

3626.64 --> 3633.2799999999997
he has been theorizing plenty of

3630.319 --> 3634.0
for plenty of time about like from an

3633.28 --> 3637.2000000000003
electric

3634.0 --> 3637.2
universe perspective

3640.319 --> 3646.48
he's been on to that for quite some time

3643.44 --> 3648.799
right although he hasn't really i don't

3646.48 --> 3651.839
know if he really understands

3648.799 --> 3653.839
or wants to understand the my approach

3651.839 --> 3657.04
which is the holographic

3653.839 --> 3658.64
sun where there is no process it's just

3657.04 --> 3662.88
an apparition it's not

3658.64 --> 3662.8799999999997
actually a thing in any location

3667.839 --> 3671.68
what do you think the slam dunk flat

3669.68 --> 3673.839
earth proof is the black swan

3671.68 --> 3676.0
the horizon not being earth curve

3673.839 --> 3677.2
because then it would have geometric

3676.0 --> 3679.76
limitations

3677.2 --> 3680.799
and in reality it does not and the

3679.76 --> 3682.7200000000003
concept

3680.799 --> 3686.48
of terrestrial refraction is a

3682.72 --> 3686.48
paradoxical machination

3687.04 --> 3691.2
that can never be legitimate

3691.68 --> 3698.319
and that is it and that also immediately

3694.16 --> 3702.5589999999997
discards any concave believers

3698.319 --> 3705.92
right so yeah that's the main thing

3702.559 --> 3709.76
and the rest is all add-on

3705.92 --> 3713.119
right but that's the foundation

3709.76 --> 3716.4
the black swan the earth was

3713.119 --> 3720.079
indeed the sphere proclaimed it is

3716.4 --> 3724.4
then the horizon would be have to be

3720.079 --> 3727.599
geometric the horizon

3724.4 --> 3731.28
as perceived is not

3727.599 --> 3735.3590000000004
abiding by the geometric necessities

3731.28 --> 3738.7200000000003
of the presumed size sphere therefore

3735.359 --> 3738.72
it's not that sphere

3738.88 --> 3741.839
there you go

3780.88 --> 3784.079
dude no

3784.96 --> 3788.88
you don't have to mirror my habits good

3788.16 --> 3792.3999999999996
servant

3788.88 --> 3792.4
but yes it's annoying

3792.64 --> 3797.2799999999997
it's mostly jason mccormack but he knows

3794.96 --> 3799.2
better than to do that in my chat

3797.28 --> 3800.88
because he is allowed back in my chat

3799.2 --> 3802.48
under specific conditions that he

3800.88 --> 3804.6400000000003
doesn't do that

3802.48 --> 3805.599
i have seen him do it in other places

3804.64 --> 3808.64
though but yes

3805.599 --> 3809.119
those places aren't mine so i'm not

3808.64 --> 3812.4
gonna

3809.119 --> 3825.839
pursue him because of that

3812.4 --> 3825.839
but it is annoying i agree

3825.92 --> 3829.599
what do you mean mirror what

3830.72 --> 3839.839
what are you talking about

3850.839 --> 3867.839
um

3852.24 --> 3867.839
neil gassentino good to see you

3875.76 --> 3879.039
oh you said i don't need to mirror your

3877.599 --> 3883.039
habit

3879.039 --> 3886.6400000000003
oh do you since when do you hate that

3883.039 --> 3886.6400000000003
that's fair thing

3889.039 --> 3892.48
because i was specifically allergic to

3891.599 --> 3894.7200000000003
it

3892.48 --> 3895.839
like two years ago when he was doing

3894.72 --> 3900.24
that constantly

3895.839 --> 3900.24
with troll socks and all that but

3901.92 --> 3906.839
i don't know anybody else that has had

3904.0 --> 3909.839
that response

3906.839 --> 3909.839
so

3918.079 --> 3923.8390000000004
all right

3928.24 --> 3931.2799999999997
it's basically just an expression of

3930.319 --> 3935.599
their religious

3931.28 --> 3940.079
faith in in in yeah inside out globe

3935.599 --> 3943.28
that's it it doesn't hold any weight

3940.079 --> 3944.48
overall i find the average ballers a lot

3943.28 --> 3947.44
more annoying

3944.48 --> 3947.44
than concavers

3948.24 --> 3954.0789999999997
it's just still very embarrassing that

3950.72 --> 3956.0789999999997
you would go for concave

3954.079 --> 3965.8390000000004
when the black swan completely throws

3956.079 --> 3965.8390000000004
that into the garbage can

3967.119 --> 3970.7200000000003
you ever going to give us live

3968.88 --> 3973.839
performance of

3970.72 --> 3976.64
intro bit what now

3973.839 --> 3979.0389999999998
now the intro of this show is made by by

3976.64 --> 3982.96
chris berry

3979.039 --> 3982.96
he's in my chat too sometimes

3984.079 --> 3989.119
he wrote it specifically for me

3990.0 --> 3994.72
and there that's it there is no other

3993.2 --> 3996.72
song

3994.72 --> 4001.0389999999998
there's no other part of it that's just

3996.72 --> 4001.0389999999998
it it's just a little intro song

4004.559 --> 4009.28
what did they get the concave idea from

4007.28 --> 4011.3590000000004
picard i don't know where they got it i

4009.28 --> 4015.599
think that the concave idea has been

4011.359 --> 4015.5989999999997
a planted controlled opposition idea

4016.319 --> 4021.839
right so some they just

4020.0 --> 4024.0
thought it up like what are all the

4021.839 --> 4026.88
things that you could think of when you

4024.0 --> 4030.24
realize the earth is not a ball

4026.88 --> 4032.48
well the disc

4030.24 --> 4034.8799999999997
with the stupid sun and moon directly

4032.48 --> 4037.52
overhead literally

4034.88 --> 4040.0
a concave it's all inside out yeah those

4037.52 --> 4043.359
are the things

4040.0 --> 4047.2
that they come up with

4043.359 --> 4049.5989999999997
and then hand to us to dwell upon

4047.2 --> 4050.319
to prevent us from moving further

4049.599 --> 4053.2000000000003
without us

4050.319 --> 4054.96
realizing it because we end up defending

4053.2 --> 4057.0389999999998
the thing that's actually holding us

4054.96 --> 4061.2400000000002
back

4057.039 --> 4064.96
right there's probably been quite a few

4061.24 --> 4066.16
freemasons doing that actually working

4064.96 --> 4069.359
that out

4066.16 --> 4072.3999999999996
making that plan to release these

4069.359 --> 4074.4
idea ideas among the public during the

4072.4 --> 4077.0
natural development

4074.4 --> 4079.2000000000003
so they would latch onto it with

4077.0 --> 4082.4
prefabricated materials with a lot of

4079.2 --> 4086.319
people find very convenient

4082.4 --> 4086.319
and then they make it their life's work

4087.68 --> 4105.12
they stick to that model that was handed

4090.16 --> 4107.759
to them

4105.12 --> 4109.92
are there any such thing as average

4107.759 --> 4110.799
concave i don't know enough concavers to

4109.92 --> 4113.759
know

4110.799 --> 4116.48
i just know that concavers have no

4113.759 --> 4119.04
technical skills whatsoever

4116.48 --> 4119.678999999999
i've never met a single concave that was

4119.04 --> 4123.199
actually

4119.679 --> 4126.319
technically capable

4123.199 --> 4127.44
of anything so to me it just seems like

4126.319 --> 4130.319
all the concaves

4127.44 --> 4131.5199999999995
is literally a group of cultists all

4130.319 --> 4134.319
people that

4131.52 --> 4136.2390000000005
don't have any mechanical insight

4134.319 --> 4138.4800000000005
whatsoever

4136.239 --> 4140.48
that's what i picked up on over the

4138.48 --> 4144.08
years it's been years

4140.48 --> 4147.599999999999
daily activity noticing people

4144.08 --> 4149.839
concave none of them know [ __ ]

4147.6 --> 4152.159000000001
they're all dumb not doesn't make them

4149.839 --> 4155.199
bad it's they're all just dumb

4152.159 --> 4158.719
right among flat earthers i've met some

4155.199 --> 4161.599999999999
really high-tech people by now

4158.719 --> 4161.92
like in the flatter of debates there are

4161.6 --> 4164.64
some

4161.92 --> 4166.64
really well researched technically

4164.64 --> 4170.4800000000005
capable

4166.64 --> 4173.6
like even mathematically talented people

4170.48 --> 4176.718999999999
i don't find them among concavers not a

4173.6 --> 4189.839
single one right

4176.719 --> 4189.839
that really stood out to me

4204.08 --> 4208.5599999999995
there is a church temple in south

4206.08 --> 4209.199
america with nasa astronauts depicted

4208.56 --> 4214.400000000001
instead

4209.199 --> 4214.4
no i have no doubt about that joey

4214.84 --> 4217.84
tribal

4230.719 --> 4235.6
right neil paul is on there and ranty is

4233.679 --> 4238.719
on there and

4235.6 --> 4238.719
they're all just

4239.28 --> 4243.84
these people are like the new media

4241.679 --> 4247.679
trash guild

4243.84 --> 4251.1990000000005
in my opinion a bunch of

4247.679 --> 4251.1990000000005
free yeah hustlers

4252.64 --> 4258.08
that are very flexible with truth and

4255.76 --> 4260.88
have priorities other than just to find

4258.08 --> 4260.88
the pure truth

4263.36 --> 4275.36
they don't want to settle for it

4273.12 --> 4275.36
hmm

4277.6 --> 4287.84
what happened with ranty now well he's

4279.6 --> 4287.84
pretty much now siding with the ball

4289.36 --> 4301.839999999999
that's what happened new

4320.159 --> 4326.639999999999
yeah you seen it coming yeah no [ __ ]

4323.199 --> 4329.919999999999
dude ranty

4326.64 --> 4331.04
freaking rolled out covet fear porn okay

4329.92 --> 4334.8
like not just

4331.04 --> 4334.8
pro no fear porn

4338.239 --> 4343.839999999999
like this guy will do anything he's

4341.28 --> 4343.84
trash

4354.84 --> 4357.84
trash

4361.6 --> 4366.56
well good servant you can't go back well

4364.32 --> 4369.28
you can if you don't give a [ __ ] about

4366.56 --> 4369.280000000001
reality

4369.36 --> 4374.96
you can if you ignore everything

4372.8 --> 4377.52
if you throw it all in the garbage can

4374.96 --> 4378.96
don't assign any value don't let it sink

4377.52 --> 4381.84
in for the long run

4378.96 --> 4383.76
because you don't care and you don't

4381.84 --> 4386.96
care to care

4383.76 --> 4389.92
and then you can do anything like

4386.96 --> 4392.2390000000005
a sociopath doesn't matter anymore you

4389.92 --> 4394.8
can do whatever you want do as that will

4392.239 --> 4396.718999999999
right who gives it [ __ ] about the truth

4394.8 --> 4401.52
if you can just

4396.719 --> 4401.52
bring whatever story learn new dupes

4406.4 --> 4409.759999999999
get back to work neil now

4408.72 --> 4412.159000000001
[Music]

4409.76 --> 4414.159000000001
like the panel hasn't opened yet over at

4412.159 --> 4427.839999999999
nathan so

4414.159 --> 4427.839999999999
oh wait it has just now

4430.08 --> 4435.36
okay it's getting a little bit too cold

4432.56 --> 4435.360000000001
for my comfort

4435.679 --> 4441.679
i'm gonna put on my beloved black

4439.76 --> 4444.2390000000005
sweater that some people

4441.679 --> 4445.1990000000005
really really love that i wear it so

4444.239 --> 4448.4
much

4445.199 --> 4448.4
they love it so much

4449.199 --> 4455.839999999999
right they love this sweater

4452.239 --> 4459.36
they just they adore that i wear this

4455.84 --> 4461.679
so regularly and there's two sweaters by

4459.36 --> 4461.679
the way

4462.4 --> 4469.839999999999
they just love it so much

4472.4 --> 4480.879999999999
right but this one is going in the wash

4475.6 --> 4485.120000000001
pretty soon i just washed the other one

4480.88 --> 4487.6
so you can finally put this one

4485.12 --> 4487.599999999999
in there

4488.159 --> 4494.4
all right but for now at least

4491.36 --> 4497.36
i'm yeah not cold because uh not

4494.4 --> 4511.5199999999995
inside the sun it's not really nice

4497.36 --> 4514.639999999999
still kind of fresh

4511.52 --> 4517.280000000001
all right ready found drop oh what you

4514.64 --> 4520.4800000000005
mean drop behind the geometric horizon

4517.28 --> 4524.639999999999
that is completely inconsistent

4520.48 --> 4527.36
oh so ranty ignored

4524.64 --> 4528.159000000001
that terrestrial refraction is a paradox

4527.36 --> 4532.239
in order to

4528.159 --> 4535.36
entertain that there might be

4532.239 --> 4536.799999999999
some curvature obstructions of things

4535.36 --> 4540.0
into the distance

4536.8 --> 4542.400000000001
did he well that's his problem if he

4540.0 --> 4546.0
wants to get all demented or play

4542.4 --> 4549.36
into other people ballers dementia

4546.0 --> 4552.4
in order to entertain but it might be

4549.36 --> 4555.28
curved after all right that's just

4552.4 --> 4557.759999999999
it's just playing you just playing

4555.28 --> 4562.239
ballers for a fool

4557.76 --> 4564.400000000001
right giving you false hope

4562.239 --> 4565.678999999999
giving you some kind of perceived

4564.4 --> 4567.44
virtual win

4565.679 --> 4568.88
that you don't even understand what

4567.44 --> 4572.4
you're doing anymore

4568.88 --> 4572.400000000001
right he's playing you

4575.44 --> 4581.28
he likes to do that apparently

4578.88 --> 4584.8
granty does really like to play people

4581.28 --> 4586.5599999999995
he's he's a sociopath like that

4584.8 --> 4588.320000000001
and when he gets in the mood he just

4586.56 --> 4590.080000000001
goes and does that

4588.32 --> 4591.5199999999995
he doesn't give a [ __ ] when he's in the

4590.08 --> 4594.88
mood he'll just go

4591.52 --> 4600.320000000001
over any border he doesn't care because

4594.88 --> 4600.32
he wants to yeah that's what a sociopath

4606.84 --> 4609.84
does

4625.04 --> 4637.84
good good servant come on

4629.12 --> 4637.84
calm down

4648.8 --> 4652.320000000001
right kevin horizon's totally totally on

4651.52 --> 4654.2390000000005
target there

4652.32 --> 4656.88
glober's too focused on what they think

4654.239 --> 4659.12
or rather what they imagine

4656.88 --> 4661.6
it's not just thinking right thinking is

4659.12 --> 4664.239
not always geometrical

4661.6 --> 4666.719
imagining though typically is

4664.239 --> 4668.799999999999
geometrical

4666.719 --> 4671.12
right and that's where they focused if

4668.8 --> 4673.92
they opened up and looked around

4671.12 --> 4674.8
things would be different right if they

4673.92 --> 4677.12
actually took

4674.8 --> 4678.08
reality for what it is then yes it would

4677.12 --> 4681.44
be different

4678.08 --> 4682.64
but they don't because there's probably

4681.44 --> 4684.879999999999
things in there

4682.64 --> 4686.56
or as nathan says it there's skeletons

4684.88 --> 4693.84
in closets

4686.56 --> 4693.84
that they don't want to know are there

4700.8 --> 4708.719
yeah aaron armstrong most f years

4703.92 --> 4712.8
hunger he's a scumbag and a liar

4708.719 --> 4717.12
and a troll a sock account producing

4712.8 --> 4721.84
stalking harassing troll piece of [ __ ]

4717.12 --> 4721.84
right he's an unreliable scumbag

4722.0 --> 4727.04
with heavy mood swings and then when

4724.96 --> 4730.719
they swing to the wrong side he becomes

4727.04 --> 4733.92
a really terrible person right

4730.719 --> 4735.04
it's not hanging them out to dry because

4733.92 --> 4737.679
oh he's not

4735.04 --> 4739.12
on our side anymore no it's not about

4737.679 --> 4741.679
side it's about

4739.12 --> 4744.239
everything we've gone through and him

4741.679 --> 4746.56
just not giving a [ __ ] anymore

4744.239 --> 4748.48
yeah i don't give a [ __ ] he gave me the

4746.56 --> 4763.679
camera yeah

4748.48 --> 4767.759999999999
who cares too much hate irwin

4763.679 --> 4769.12
no he's an [ __ ] and he's a scumbag

4767.76 --> 4772.96
and he has acted

4769.12 --> 4774.84
as a scumbag to me when he gave me that

4772.96 --> 4777.6
camera

4774.84 --> 4780.96
immediately not

4777.6 --> 4782.52
after a while immediately he started

4780.96 --> 4785.92
bullying me about it

4782.52 --> 4787.84
immediately all right and he hasn't

4785.92 --> 4790.4
stopped

4787.84 --> 4792.96
every time he gets in one of his moods

4790.4 --> 4796.4
comes by with his trollishness

4792.96 --> 4799.04
and he starts to bully me with it yeah

4796.4 --> 4799.5199999999995
that's the reason he gave it to me not

4799.04 --> 4802.239
to be

4799.52 --> 4804.56
nice he gave it to me so he could find

4802.239 --> 4808.32
an excuse to act like a complete

4804.56 --> 4808.8
[ __ ] to me that's why he gave it to

4808.32 --> 4813.04
me

4808.8 --> 4813.04
not to be nice right

4814.88 --> 4818.0
and there are times where i literally

4816.8 --> 4820.639
wish i hadn't

4818.0 --> 4820.639
accepted it

4822.96 --> 4827.04
because then he would probably not have

4824.8 --> 4830.2390000000005
an excuse to harass me

4827.04 --> 4833.28
about it now

4830.239 --> 4835.04
that would be kind of i would be

4833.28 --> 4838.0
i would have missed out on some cool

4835.04 --> 4840.4
footage that i've made

4838.0 --> 4841.76
yeah that's right accusing others of

4840.4 --> 4847.839999999999
mood swings right

4841.76 --> 4847.84
because they have them the quad

4870.0 --> 4874.4
i don't care what he does to himself

4871.76 --> 4876.639
kevin horizons

4874.4 --> 4877.44
all i care about is that he harasses

4876.639 --> 4880.8
other people

4877.44 --> 4881.839999999999
including myself now if he has issues

4880.8 --> 4884.0
with himself

4881.84 --> 4885.360000000001
that he can face and that's why he do

4884.0 --> 4889.36
this does this

4885.36 --> 4892.48
it's his [ __ ] problem yeah

4889.36 --> 4894.719
i don't care why a bully bully

4892.48 --> 4896.638999999999
somebody i just punch them in the

4894.719 --> 4899.199
[ __ ] face

4896.639 --> 4900.159000000001
it's their [ __ ] problem if they can't

4899.199 --> 4903.839999999999
deal with their own

4900.159 --> 4903.839999999999
inner mechanics

4904.72 --> 4907.759
[Music]

4920.0 --> 4926.72
yeah massive sacrifice oh dude [ __ ] off

4923.92 --> 4927.96
[ __ ] you and [ __ ] ranty

4926.72 --> 4931.280000000001
[Music]

4927.96 --> 4932.56
sacrifices what sacrifice sacrifices for

4931.28 --> 4934.96
his [ __ ] vanity

4932.56 --> 4936.0
he just wanted to claim the credit he

4934.96 --> 4938.88
wanted to be

4936.0 --> 4939.679
flat earth right he didn't do that for

4938.88 --> 4943.12
flat earth

4939.679 --> 4945.28
he did it for the [ __ ] credit

4943.12 --> 4948.88
he doesn't give a [ __ ] about anyone

4945.28 --> 4950.88
except his own [ __ ] ego

4948.88 --> 4952.56
being praised and being put on a

4950.88 --> 4955.679
pedestal that's what he wants

4952.56 --> 4958.2390000000005
he doesn't give a [ __ ]

4955.679 --> 4959.679
about flat earth or the people in it he

4958.239 --> 4961.759999999999
does not

4959.679 --> 4965.36
oh yeah he's probably pretty good at

4961.76 --> 4965.360000000001
trying to convince you that he is

4965.679 --> 4969.76
i know because he's a sociopath and

4967.92 --> 4972.2390000000005
that's what they're good at

4969.76 --> 4973.84
convincing you putting it to sleep to

4972.239 --> 4975.919999999999
kind of like him again into

4973.84 --> 4976.88
oh but given the benefit of the doubt

4975.92 --> 4979.36
you know

4976.88 --> 4981.04
he was so nice to me at that moment i

4979.36 --> 4982.08
don't know i can't really put it

4981.04 --> 4984.0
together with

4982.08 --> 4985.6
what i'm seeing right now how he's a

4984.0 --> 4988.639
total maniac

4985.6 --> 4990.400000000001
scumbag and a betrayer

4988.639 --> 4992.32
right but i'm gonna hold on to that

4990.4 --> 4994.0
memory if when he was really nice to me

4992.32 --> 4995.5199999999995
that one time yeah yeah that's what

4994.0 --> 4999.9
sociopaths do

4995.52 --> 5003.790000000001
yeah get over yourself

4999.9 --> 5003.79
[Music]

5017.12 --> 5024.8
right joey tribal exactly exactly

5021.679 --> 5025.92
he made an item out of it he gave me the

5024.8 --> 5030.8
camera

5025.92 --> 5030.8
just so he can make an item out of me

5031.12 --> 5034.5599999999995
that's what he did because he is a

5032.88 --> 5038.400000000001
[ __ ] scumbag

5034.56 --> 5043.84
sociopath disgusting

5038.4 --> 5043.839999999999
little [ __ ] grabbler that's what he is

5048.639 --> 5053.36
oh yeah i have a good show a daily show

5051.12 --> 5054.96
every day where i talk about cosmogeny

5053.36 --> 5057.92
and get real

5054.96 --> 5059.6
yeah and talk about esoterics and get

5057.92 --> 5062.32
real with that

5059.6 --> 5064.0
and talk about the world fate and get

5062.32 --> 5067.599999999999
real with that

5064.0 --> 5072.239
yeah and i don't break

5067.6 --> 5075.1990000000005
i don't break off i don't say

5072.239 --> 5077.36
i'm throwing it all away i'm going to go

5075.199 --> 5080.799999999999
that completely opposite direction

5077.36 --> 5082.4
and suddenly start basically pissing

5080.8 --> 5082.88
over everything that i've done before

5082.4 --> 5086.48
that

5082.88 --> 5088.88
yeah i don't do that ranty does

5086.48 --> 5091.04
he's doing it right now doing it right

5088.88 --> 5091.04
now

5100.0 --> 5103.84
that's right kevin horizons it was

5105.199 --> 5108.719
yeah joey tribal i know it's funny right

5108.0 --> 5111.84
because it's

5108.719 --> 5114.2390000000005
true that's what makes it so

5111.84 --> 5114.2390000000005
funny

5115.679 --> 5121.12
right and how long has it taken for me

5118.719 --> 5123.199
even to ram him bash him over the head

5121.12 --> 5126.32
with that

5123.199 --> 5129.44
right because i did give him a chance

5126.32 --> 5129.92
to grow out of it to stop doing that to

5129.44 --> 5132.159
stop

5129.92 --> 5133.84
being that [ __ ] little sociopath

5132.159 --> 5136.719
[ __ ] grabbler

5133.84 --> 5139.28
which was in him like he even sort of

5136.719 --> 5142.8
showed it like i am dealing with this

5139.28 --> 5145.92
and i always advised him no

5142.8 --> 5146.400000000001
extinguish that we need you people need

5145.92 --> 5149.6
you

5146.4 --> 5155.839999999999
and he didn't want to and now

5149.6 --> 5155.84
he is what he is he burned the bridges

5158.159 --> 5162.32
and that's what you get and the more you

5160.88 --> 5164.96
do that

5162.32 --> 5166.96
the more i will eventually just start

5164.96 --> 5169.84
calling you exactly what you

5166.96 --> 5169.84
are

5194.84 --> 5197.84
so

5204.639 --> 5211.12
right i had even even forgotten that

5207.44 --> 5214.799999999999
good servant yes i did i did actually

5211.12 --> 5217.04
do that because it was to me

5214.8 --> 5219.1990000000005
very convenient and i was very happy

5217.04 --> 5220.08
with it and i really had thought at the

5219.199 --> 5223.12
time

5220.08 --> 5223.44
maybe he means it maybe he's actually

5223.12 --> 5226.5599999999995
now

5223.44 --> 5229.678999999999
just gonna stop the bad bully

5226.56 --> 5234.0
habits and gonna get real but

5229.679 --> 5234.0
no that didn't last very long did it

5234.48 --> 5239.839999999999
and he just ignored everything

5258.4 --> 5261.679
right indeed the cool moon video with

5260.56 --> 5264.96
the airplane yeah

5261.679 --> 5266.719
it was awesome it was so clear

5264.96 --> 5268.2390000000005
right that was amazing that moment if

5266.719 --> 5281.84
i'd never taken the camera

5268.239 --> 5281.839999999999
that video would not exist

5372.88 --> 5376.88
would do it in person right yeah he gave

5375.28 --> 5378.88
it to nathan

5376.88 --> 5380.56
hey but at least nathan got a really

5378.88 --> 5384.2390000000005
cool photograph out of it

5380.56 --> 5387.6
right so yeah whatever

5384.239 --> 5389.5199999999995
ranty is shittying with

5387.6 --> 5391.76
like i would never want it to change

5389.52 --> 5392.88
because i got a really gold video out of

5391.76 --> 5395.12
it

5392.88 --> 5396.8
nathan got a really cool picture of me

5395.12 --> 5399.92
out of it that he regularly

5396.8 --> 5401.28
uses on his show and i'm really happy

5399.92 --> 5407.1990000000005
with that picture i think i

5401.28 --> 5421.84
look really good on it

5407.199 --> 5421.839999999999
so it's not all gone to waste

5427.44 --> 5430.879999999999
math power that really

5431.199 --> 5436.239
like i don't think he would know what to

5433.679 --> 5438.8
do with me i think a lot of people

5436.239 --> 5441.5199999999995
especially the higher profile ones don't

5438.8 --> 5443.52
know what to do with me man they don't

5441.52 --> 5446.4800000000005
even know how to address me

5443.52 --> 5448.2390000000005
they don't know what stance to take

5446.48 --> 5451.919999999999
because i am not

5448.239 --> 5454.159
like an adapted media guy

5451.92 --> 5457.1990000000005
like all of them they wouldn't know what

5454.159 --> 5457.199
to do with me man

5457.84 --> 5462.159000000001
but sure if they want to look anybody

5461.199 --> 5464.48
like if freaking

5462.159 --> 5466.638999999999
eric debay came to me and said dude i

5464.48 --> 5470.239
wanna talk with you

5466.639 --> 5473.36
wanna talk cosmogeny i'd be yo

5470.239 --> 5474.638999999999
dude i'd be a little nervous sure i

5473.36 --> 5477.679
would be

5474.639 --> 5478.4800000000005
i'll do it i've been open for all of

5477.679 --> 5480.8
that

5478.48 --> 5480.799999999999
right

5483.36 --> 5487.44
as long as that i don't have to

5484.96 --> 5488.719
basically travel outside with people i

5487.44 --> 5491.44
don't know that well

5488.719 --> 5493.92
for a prolonged period not having

5491.44 --> 5494.4
availability to the exact food that i

5493.92 --> 5497.679
need

5494.4 --> 5499.44
then then i'm gonna like

5497.679 --> 5502.159
probably not do it that's why i didn't

5499.44 --> 5504.08
go on the globe-like tour

5502.159 --> 5505.679
after the amsterdam conference because

5504.08 --> 5506.719
that was too much right but when it

5505.679 --> 5509.12
comes to just

5506.719 --> 5510.52
talking with people or even online yeah

5509.12 --> 5513.5199999999995
i am open to

5510.52 --> 5513.52
everybody

5514.239 --> 5521.36
everybody that has anything

5517.84 --> 5524.56
like to say that has a reach

5521.36 --> 5528.08
but they will have to expect me to be me

5524.56 --> 5531.04
and to basically reach that point

5528.08 --> 5532.639
eventually inevitably where i will start

5531.04 --> 5534.48
pointing exactly

5532.639 --> 5536.8
right you say this you say that you say

5534.48 --> 5538.5599999999995
that that's wrong and this is why that's

5536.8 --> 5541.76
wrong that's why that's wrong that's why

5538.56 --> 5542.320000000001
because that's what i am i'm not gonna

5541.76 --> 5544.96
be

5542.32 --> 5546.639
mean about it i'm just gonna point out

5544.96 --> 5548.4
where they're incorrect because that's

5546.639 --> 5552.4800000000005
what i am that's what i do

5548.4 --> 5555.36
if they can't handle that yeah then

5552.48 --> 5556.879999999999
then just leave me alone because i will

5555.36 --> 5561.44
do that

5556.88 --> 5565.12
absolutely i will

5561.44 --> 5568.4
but hey eric eddie bravo

5565.12 --> 5570.639
would be awesome right if

5568.4 --> 5572.638999999999
eddie bravo can appreciate nathan oakley

5570.639 --> 5574.159000000001
then i think that he could probably also

5572.639 --> 5576.08
appreciate me

5574.159 --> 5577.759999999999
so having like a conversation with eddie

5576.08 --> 5579.76
bravo about flat earth and

5577.76 --> 5581.360000000001
who knows kovitz [ __ ] maybe he wants to

5579.76 --> 5586.4800000000005
talk about german new medicine

5581.36 --> 5586.48
the alternatives that will be kick-ass

5587.12 --> 5592.96
right or who knows

5591.28 --> 5595.04
getting on with mark sorry but mark

5592.96 --> 5598.2390000000005
sergeant doesn't really do that

5595.04 --> 5599.44
but any of the other guys sure but yeah

5598.239 --> 5603.599999999999
guess what

5599.44 --> 5606.4
bob nodell doesn't like me

5603.6 --> 5608.320000000001
so yeah half of these people doing

5606.4 --> 5610.08
regular activities they're not gonna

5608.32 --> 5610.5599999999995
invite me on because that's gonna make

5610.08 --> 5613.6
bob

5610.56 --> 5616.159000000001
angry again because bob doesn't like it

5613.6 --> 5617.52
that i'm actually kind of popular among

5616.159 --> 5620.879999999999
some people

5617.52 --> 5623.6
every time i get in anywhere

5620.88 --> 5624.96
and just am in the right spot feeling

5623.6 --> 5627.6
god being myself

5624.96 --> 5629.12
and doing what i typically do inserting

5627.6 --> 5632.400000000001
good info

5629.12 --> 5633.04
he gets like once they like get in front

5632.4 --> 5636.5599999999995
of me like

5633.04 --> 5639.04
hi i'm here i'm bob i'm very cool

5636.56 --> 5641.92
hello to you too like everybody that

5639.04 --> 5644.8
literally says hello in chats

5641.92 --> 5645.6
where i'm at bob is going to be like

5644.8 --> 5648.719
hello

5645.6 --> 5650.08
hello to you two i'm here i'm like he

5648.719 --> 5654.159
does that [ __ ] okay

5650.08 --> 5656.96
like bob really [ __ ] hates me

5654.159 --> 5658.879999999999
probably fears me and he should because

5656.96 --> 5661.679
i know what he did

5658.88 --> 5663.679
and i'm never forgetting that ever and

5661.679 --> 5664.8
he can't handle that and he goes all

5663.679 --> 5667.28
nuts about it

5664.8 --> 5669.76
and so yeah every time i'm somewhere i'm

5667.28 --> 5673.36
like the giant thorn in his eye

5669.76 --> 5674.75
and he harasses everyone about it

5673.36 --> 5677.789
everyone

5674.75 --> 5677.789
[Music]

5678.48 --> 5683.44
so yeah i don't think i'm ever going to

5680.88 --> 5687.36
be like on with karen b

5683.44 --> 5690.719
or patricia stare or jaron

5687.36 --> 5691.119
or any of them ever again because they

5690.719 --> 5694.0
have

5691.119 --> 5695.28
barred me and yeah nathan oakley the

5694.0 --> 5698.56
same

5695.28 --> 5702.719
because we said bad thing

5698.56 --> 5704.88
about bob we didn't pat him on the head

5702.719 --> 5706.719
like he's always a good boy that can

5704.88 --> 5708.8
never do anything wrong

5706.719 --> 5710.8
yeah and that's what happened so yeah

5708.8 --> 5714.4800000000005
the community is divided

5710.8 --> 5718.320000000001
there is a giant camp an empire

5714.48 --> 5723.28
with a hierarchical structure

5718.32 --> 5725.44
right that bars people that criticize

5723.28 --> 5728.0
it's there yeah not going to be invited

5725.44 --> 5730.638999999999
by that but i don't know who else

5728.0 --> 5732.88
out there is not influenced by that

5730.639 --> 5736.32
[ __ ]

5732.88 --> 5743.679
that might actually have me on

5736.32 --> 5746.5599999999995
because i am available i am available

5743.679 --> 5747.36
hey miss kang good to see you why does

5746.56 --> 5752.400000000001
not bob

5747.36 --> 5755.44
doesn't why doesn't he like me well

5752.4 --> 5757.04
because i'm with nathan oakley and i i

5755.44 --> 5760.48
don't

5757.04 --> 5765.199
believe in his dielectric

5760.48 --> 5768.4
incoherent babbling nonsense gravity

5765.199 --> 5771.599999999999
and because i remember

5768.4 --> 5773.679
because i saw it live when it happened

5771.6 --> 5775.6
when he said some really [ __ ] up

5773.679 --> 5778.56
things

5775.6 --> 5780.639
about child abuse let's just euphemize

5778.56 --> 5783.1990000000005
it a little like that

5780.639 --> 5783.84
and the way he said it i'm very

5783.199 --> 5786.239
sensitive

5783.84 --> 5789.1990000000005
not like trigger sensitive but just as

5786.239 --> 5791.599999999999
in literally sensing what it is

5789.199 --> 5795.36
and the way he said that was just going

5791.6 --> 5798.96
over a border nobody should ever go

5795.36 --> 5801.119
because if you yeah and he

5798.96 --> 5802.639
i spoke out about it criticized him for

5801.119 --> 5806.239
it and he's just

5802.639 --> 5806.2390000000005
gone to panic about it

5806.8 --> 5812.639
so i am like on the danger list to him

5810.08 --> 5814.239
like he just wants to imagine a world

5812.639 --> 5816.2390000000005
without arwin

5814.239 --> 5818.0
everything is all right if there's just

5816.239 --> 5821.5199999999995
no arwin

5818.0 --> 5825.119
right so anybody that's even going to be

5821.52 --> 5826.080000000001
caught talking to me that he has a grip

5825.119 --> 5829.199
on

5826.08 --> 5833.36
is going to get

5829.199 --> 5837.119
harassed is going to feel the pressure

5833.36 --> 5841.839999999999
it's going to feel the pressure yeah a

5837.119 --> 5841.839999999999
troll [ __ ]

5842.88 --> 5848.400000000001
it's right here you [ __ ] piece of

5844.639 --> 5848.400000000001
[ __ ] yeah [ __ ] you

5852.88 --> 5859.84
hey how about randy's drone yeah

5856.639 --> 5862.8
that drone that over a thousand

5859.84 --> 5863.28
pounds worth drone that he supposedly

5862.8 --> 5866.320000000001
got

5863.28 --> 5868.159
how about that maybe he actually sold it

5866.32 --> 5871.04
for drugs have you ever considered that

5868.159 --> 5871.04
your [ __ ] face

5873.28 --> 5876.8
where's his drone where's his drone

5875.6 --> 5880.0
where's randy's drone

5876.8 --> 5882.159000000001
oh he's never shown it ever

5880.0 --> 5884.88
where's his drone yeah that most

5882.159 --> 5888.48
expensive thing he ever got money from

5884.88 --> 5891.28
from people to get where is it

5888.48 --> 5892.32
it isn't anywhere because he didn't get

5891.28 --> 5897.04
it

5892.32 --> 5911.84
he just took the money and then lied

5897.04 --> 5911.84
yeah [ __ ]

5919.2 --> 5924.4
[Music]

5921.28 --> 5925.599999999999
he showed his drone scene one once he

5924.4 --> 5928.96
showed

5925.6 --> 5930.96
right so he took it out of the package

5928.96 --> 5934.719
then he put it back into the package and

5930.96 --> 5934.719
then he got his money back

5935.199 --> 5939.839999999999
it's really simple guys

5958.08 --> 5962.4
right john bernards yeah a lot of people

5960.159 --> 5963.119
did because they thought that grant is

5962.4 --> 5965.599999999999
so awesome

5963.119 --> 5966.719
ranty actually goes out in the field and

5965.6 --> 5970.2390000000005
does things

5966.719 --> 5974.2390000000005
yeah yeah he also just lies

5970.239 --> 5974.799999999999
and takes money and then never addresses

5974.239 --> 5978.239
it again

5974.8 --> 5981.76
as he accuses everybody else

5978.239 --> 5984.0
that he can about supposedly

5981.76 --> 5986.719
doing just that he projects it to

5984.0 --> 5988.0
everybody else to avoid people from

5986.719 --> 5990.96
asking him because he

5988.0 --> 5992.8
never talks about it ever he's never

5990.96 --> 5994.56
addressed it ever

5992.8 --> 5996.719
because he knows what he's done and he's

5994.56 --> 6000.2390000000005
not that good a liar

5996.719 --> 6002.56
right he lies

6000.239 --> 6004.32
and he's good in the moment of the lies

6002.56 --> 6005.76
because he's a sociopath and he doesn't

6004.32 --> 6009.28
give a [ __ ] he thinks it's

6005.76 --> 6012.4800000000005
funny he thinks it's funny to do that

6009.28 --> 6015.759999999999
right but he's not a good liar

6012.48 --> 6019.678999999999
once he has actually committed to a lie

6015.76 --> 6021.679
then actually pretending

6019.679 --> 6024.32
it didn't happen or getting through that

6021.679 --> 6026.96
he's not good at that at all

6024.32 --> 6028.96
right he just lies he's not good at

6026.96 --> 6032.159
lying but he just does it

6028.96 --> 6032.159
because he doesn't give a [ __ ]

6034.8 --> 6038.88
iron armstrong i don't know about nathan

6036.88 --> 6042.0
thompson man nathan thompson has

6038.88 --> 6045.6
issues for sure i don't know i'm not

6042.0 --> 6045.6
gonna call him a lying thief

6046.32 --> 6050.239
because i don't know enough about him i

6049.44 --> 6053.759999999999
know he's

6050.239 --> 6053.759999999999
had some weird issues

6054.96 --> 6058.4
i personally i wouldn't really trust him

6057.44 --> 6061.759999999999
but

6058.4 --> 6064.879999999999
i don't know man i'm

6061.76 --> 6079.84

6087.119 --> 6089.759999999999

6090.8 --> 6094.4800000000005
i it might be still in ho on hold

6093.6 --> 6099.52
basically like

6094.48 --> 6099.5199999999995
he submitted it and it's just

6099.84 --> 6104.0
these things sometimes takes incredible

6101.92 --> 6105.52
take incredible long times before they

6104.0 --> 6108.96
even get addressed they just

6105.52 --> 6120.2390000000005
