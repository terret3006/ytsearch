1.22 --> 9.450000000000001
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

5.79 --> 17.369
early-bird number 14 I'm your host

9.45 --> 19.859
Arwen so no guests today yet it's cold

17.369 --> 22.8
again outside but a lot better because

19.859 --> 26.07
it's not so windy so same temperature

22.8 --> 27.23
but when it's not windy it's pretty

26.07 --> 32.94
decent

27.23 --> 35.76
so yeah I'm doing all right today it's a

32.94 --> 41.91
very late night though because now I got

35.76 --> 44.28
Netflix oh dear so suddenly strain

41.91 --> 47.55
myself nothing oh what's this Oh what's

44.28 --> 53.93
this so I already got to science fiction

47.55 --> 53.93
time related series flagged and oh dear

55.039 --> 61.43
but yeah I'm keeping myself amused and

63.83 --> 72.29899999999999
thinking and dreaming a lot but yeah a

69.78 --> 75.86
movie I also watched in its entirety

72.299 --> 82.65
yesterday its arrival I was really

75.86 --> 85.95
fascinating really good movie and yeah

82.65 --> 93.11000000000001
it was was language it was about

85.95 --> 97.77000000000001
language alien language and basically

93.11 --> 101.25
communicating the relation between forms

97.77 --> 105.94999999999999
of communications languages and ways of

101.25 --> 105.95
thinking and it was a fascinating

106.34 --> 112.229
concept eventually yeah I almost

109.68 --> 116.25
shouldn't spoil it because then you're

112.229 --> 119.85
gonna see through the movie a lot but it

116.25 --> 126.649
was really good let's say it was they

119.85 --> 126.649
actually used loved it time nonlinearity

130.2 --> 135.54999999999998
so yeah I get it really got a kick out

135.01 --> 136.64999999999998
of that one

135.55 --> 141.94
[Music]

136.65 --> 145.81
what's very fascinating it also reminded

141.94 --> 151.23
me a lot about my own experiences not

145.81 --> 155.5
literally like that but never seen any

151.23 --> 157.69
septa pods that will be really cool

155.5 --> 162.55
I thought the design for the creatures

157.69 --> 166.3
were awesome or very fascinating well

162.55 --> 170.98000000000002
thought-through octopus like creatures

166.3 --> 174.75
yeah ideal you know these are the squids

170.98 --> 178.32999999999998
and octopuses creatures on this earth

174.75 --> 180.58
people still figuring out like what did

178.33 --> 184.18
God really do something that where did

180.58 --> 188.019
that come from where was it introduced

184.18 --> 192.63
by some alien species a lot of people I

188.019 --> 192.63
used to think that and who knows

196.23 --> 201.64999999999998
I wonder is there even is there mention

199.23 --> 206.09
in the Bible

201.65 --> 208.47
octopi and I think there was a

206.09 --> 214.05
generalization in with sea creatures at

208.47 --> 216.75
least but anyway doesn't really matter

214.05 --> 218.63000000000002
it was a good movie and made me think a

216.75 --> 225.78
lot

218.63 --> 231.26
yeah so let's see it wasn't yet Daniel

225.78 --> 238.76
field hello JJ the rake

231.26 --> 238.76
Daniel goody ruin Thorson welcome dude

240.08 --> 249.69
cute yeah it's freezing over there too I

245.22 --> 253.35
guess or well cold three degrees Celsius

249.69 --> 262.44
yep that's cold that's also water that's

253.35 --> 264.89
the start of water cold so what else can

262.44 --> 264.89
I talk about

271.83 --> 286.34999999999997
the weird thing is with me and Flat

277.18 --> 290.47
Earth I am the way I approach it is very

286.35 --> 294.22
reactionary in a unique way because I

290.47 --> 296.44000000000005
don't think a lot about Flat Earth and

294.22 --> 298.38000000000005
what's going on but when it actually

296.44 --> 302.65
happens when there is conversation

298.38 --> 305.8
that's when I get the insights it's a

302.65 --> 308.26
unique property I have every time I'm

305.8 --> 310.81
really interested in something there's

308.26 --> 312.669
only so much I can do on my own but when

310.81 --> 315.639
I'm interacting with other people that's

312.669 --> 320.59
usually when inspiration hits me very

315.639 --> 322.87
hard even to a degree that it when I try

320.59 --> 325.9
to talk about really really complex

322.87 --> 330.58
subjects like the the dark world in its

325.9 --> 335.13
entirety and all the sensitive elements

330.58 --> 338.56
that I tend to not share in public then

335.13 --> 342.45
even if these people as long as they

338.56 --> 346.0
know me and trust me even if they don't

342.45 --> 348.58
really have the full capacity to grasp

346.0 --> 350.229
that the total consequences of

348.58 --> 355.93
everything that I'm trying to convey

350.229 --> 357.82
I will suddenly get new answers even

355.93 --> 359.74
though they won't actually do it but

357.82 --> 362.96999999999997
because I'm conversing with them the

359.74 --> 365.47
answers will arrive to me through

362.97 --> 369.78900000000004
through the cosmos for the Akashic

365.47 --> 375.03900000000004
record I guess it's like another me

369.789 --> 378.31
that's just responding and it's a gift

375.039 --> 382.24
it's a great gift but you need to wield

378.31 --> 387.51
it properly otherwise the other elements

382.24 --> 391.18
will start to advise you so if another

387.51 --> 394.21
reason and very powerful motivation for

391.18 --> 402.63
me to be a pure person because it only

394.21 --> 406.71999999999997
really works when I am pure yeah so

402.63 --> 414.76
being good comes with its advantages for

406.72 --> 415.36
me and yeah getting answers yeah it's

414.76 --> 421.21
awesome

415.36 --> 423.449
because no matter how you see it like I

421.21 --> 426.88
don't even see it as being smart

423.449 --> 429.97
although it does require a certain

426.88 --> 432.28
insight it's not like I constructed it

429.97 --> 435.699
in a tiresome process every time no it

432.28 --> 440.67999999999995
just freakin hits me it's like literally

435.699 --> 443.91900000000004
like a gift and I don't feel like oh man

440.68 --> 445.6
I accomplished so much intellectually

443.919 --> 448.71
every time I come up with these ideas

445.6 --> 451.69
although I am naturally very proud and I

448.71 --> 454.93
hate it if other people who would steal

451.69 --> 458.5
the ideas and not give me credit for it

454.93 --> 461.62
basically but I don't think such an

458.5 --> 465.36
incredible genius for coming up with the

461.62 --> 469.15
ideas although I am very proud of my

465.36 --> 471.52000000000004
ability eventually to explain it

469.15 --> 477.96999999999997
correctly that but that's another that's

471.52 --> 481.599
another side of it but the actual ideas

477.97 --> 488.5
themselves they just hit me just really

481.599 --> 492.13
lucky I guess or a blessed just luckiest

488.5 --> 495.84
it's not just luck can't happen under

492.13 --> 500.53
any circumstances it's not random but I

495.84 --> 503.40999999999997
am fortunate to have it and yeah I was

500.53 --> 505.55999999999995
born with that I did when I was very

503.41 --> 505.56
young

509.699 --> 518.229
anyway that's some of my inner workings

513.46 --> 520.0
and yeah I don't know a few guys even

518.229 --> 524.3100000000001
get what I'm saying if you believe me or

520.0 --> 531.7
not but I know this works for me and

524.31 --> 534.4899999999999
well you know the the fruits tell the

531.7 --> 539.1
story basically you know them by their

534.49 --> 543.339
fruits and as long as I keep um

539.1 --> 548.13
figuring out stuff and refining my

543.339 --> 553.589
explanations I am kind of bearing fruits

548.13 --> 553.5889999999999
for anyone to take so yeah

556.35 --> 568.2900000000001
anyway alright alright

566.16 --> 572.06
a flat earth question by Daniel feel

568.29 --> 579.29
Darwin you still leaning towards square

572.06 --> 579.29
well you know what yeah I think a

580.07 --> 591.2700000000001
looping confined space is actually much

586.32 --> 593.84
more likely than a physical barrier of

591.27 --> 593.84
some kind

594.08 --> 601.19
although yeah it all depends is that

596.76 --> 604.29
barrier truly the end or is it a

601.19 --> 606.75
container and outside is something else

604.29 --> 608.25
it all depends on run into the barrier

606.75 --> 610.32
and you see through it is there other

608.25 --> 614.15
stuff there or is it just a reflection

610.32 --> 620.7600000000001
or it's just black

614.15 --> 622.56
so yeah all depends would make it more

620.76 --> 625.47
mysterious if we were like in a bubble

622.56 --> 631.8
but a looping confine is just

625.47 --> 634.83
architectural a very if it's possible a

631.8 --> 636.54
very easy solution to a lot of problems

634.83 --> 641.84
and I explained this in my rectangular

636.54 --> 644.0699999999999
looping model hangouts so yeah and

641.84 --> 648.86
whether you call it a square or a

644.07 --> 654.87
rectangle suggesting more land

648.86 --> 657.63
potentially fast amount yeah the looping

654.87 --> 660.9
concept is definitely I'm hanging on to

657.63 --> 665.1899999999999
it and also because it's not for example

660.9 --> 669.4499999999999
like gravity at current prospects it's

665.19 --> 671.4300000000001
true it is actually provable they all

669.45 --> 674.5500000000001
depends you have to measure everything

671.43 --> 677.5799999999999
out on the land surface and the sea the

674.55 --> 684.7199999999999
ocean bottoms and then see what you got

677.58 --> 688.25
and from that you yeah you just keep on

684.72 --> 688.25
working until you find

688.96 --> 696.529
well I guess yeah you could call it

694.22 --> 698.4200000000001
still a model that has in Cygnet that

696.529 --> 703.0
doesn't have any significant problems

698.42 --> 707.24
with it or you don't have to resort to

703.0 --> 709.46
creating projections where it can be as

707.24 --> 712.69
little as possible and I think that if

709.46 --> 715.339
you allow the looping concept into such

712.69 --> 719.87
thing that's probably going to be

715.339 --> 722.9300000000001
relatively easy to do because you just

719.87 --> 728.529
create a border that interconnects and

722.93 --> 731.2099999999999
you have to get that right so anyway

728.529 --> 734.89
yeah I stand still behind the

731.21 --> 737.48
rectangular looping model absolutely

734.89 --> 741.98
although I do not exclude the

737.48 --> 746.54
possibility of an actual disc of some

741.98 --> 750.98
kind or you know even the the north

746.54 --> 754.16
version the is it the egg earth as

750.98 --> 758.72
freaky as it looks you know what in a

754.16 --> 761.709
way yes but if you consider that that

758.72 --> 765.32
thing is probably still a projection

761.709 --> 767.4699999999999
it's still projection base even though

765.32 --> 769.94
it's very three-dimensional in its

767.47 --> 772.76
animation it's still up it's still

769.94 --> 775.19
projection based you gotta fit yeah

772.76 --> 777.68
realize that that's what it's the maps

775.19 --> 782.87
that you do see as part of it that's

777.68 --> 787.12
what it's based on projection so but

782.87 --> 790.1
yeah even that model the egg earth and

787.12 --> 791.9
the rectangular looping model as I

790.1 --> 795.41
envisioned it although slightly

791.9 --> 797.6
different yeah one of the original

795.41 --> 800.54
concepts of the rectangular looping home

797.6 --> 804.08
model which is like it's three section

800.54 --> 806.6899999999999
earth but earth would be the middle part

804.08 --> 811.19
like middle earth and there will be a

806.69 --> 818.48
northern part and a southern part that

811.19 --> 820.5500000000001
yeah there's miss of these regions so I

818.48 --> 822.029
think that rather we would be the middle

820.55 --> 824.04
ring

822.029 --> 827.48
and it yeah doesn't necessarily need to

824.04 --> 830.88
be a ring it can just be looping

827.48 --> 832.86
intersections north to south and it's

830.88 --> 838.52
just looping east to west and that loop

832.86 --> 846.98
is shorter and also the the path the

838.52 --> 846.98
daylight travels over each region so

847.279 --> 856.32
yeah it is kind of similar only I I

850.529 --> 860.3389999999999
guess I step away from the disc-shaped

856.32 --> 861.38
projection in my modeling concept that's

860.339 --> 866.089
basically it

861.38 --> 870.959
it's a difference the difference some

866.089 --> 875.0600000000001
Flat Earth looping rectangular versus

870.959 --> 875.06
disk based systems

879.01 --> 881.7
all right

890.63 --> 899.07
ruin dorsa trying to explain to Daniel

894.89 --> 901.74
looping well the thing is room the

899.07 --> 905.5100000000001
looping aspects not just about the Sun

901.74 --> 909.6
because yeah the Sun holographic

905.51 --> 913.8
naturally but that's why I mentioned the

909.6 --> 918.41
daylight the daylight travels from the

913.8 --> 922.41
east to west looping confine which is a

918.41 --> 924.39
limited length in my rectangular looping

922.41 --> 925.98
model is pretty much it's probably going

924.39 --> 929.25
to be roughly the same everywhere

925.98 --> 933.4200000000001
although as I said the rectangle the

929.25 --> 939.779
rectangle doesn't have to turn out to be

933.42 --> 942.63
perfectly straight could be like pearls

939.779 --> 944.4
like a string of pearls that at some

942.63 --> 946.95
spike becomes tighter and then becomes

944.4 --> 949.29
bigger and tighter and bigger that even

946.95 --> 952.74
helps suggest the planet thanks.thanks

949.29 --> 956.91
created but yeah there could be just

952.74 --> 961.53
other continents almost very similar

956.91 --> 963.6
also suggesting a globe shape but they

961.53 --> 968.37
would be interconnected like a string of

963.6 --> 971.28
beads yeah it's by the way people this

968.37 --> 975.24
is all in my very very very first hang

971.28 --> 979.74
on all of it plucked it all directly out

975.24 --> 982.26
of my visions I didn't even really know

979.74 --> 984.1800000000001
what I was talking about is basically

982.26 --> 991.25
improvising you have to keep that in

984.18 --> 997.17
mind if you watch it and then yeah

991.25 --> 1000.88
pretty amazing how this works but yeah

997.17 --> 1000.88
the loop doesn't necessarily need to be

1000.94 --> 1011.1800000000001
straight the in spatial interconnection

1005.54 --> 1014.24
of the loop can be curved so that say at

1011.18 --> 1017.06
the equator where the Sun travels over

1014.24 --> 1022.72
or the daylight is the strongest I guess

1017.06 --> 1022.7199999999999
on average that in that region

1022.78 --> 1029.26
the loop could be the widest is the west

1026.2 --> 1032.46
and yeah more north/south you go from

1029.26 --> 1037.24
there starts to tighten them some

1032.46 --> 1041.26
shorter until the Arctic and then if you

1037.24 --> 1043.54
travel straight line beyond there it may

1041.26 --> 1045.73
be the Arctic me and or me not and I

1043.54 --> 1049.06
don't know what you're gonna end up with

1045.73 --> 1053.5
and solely the loop starts to widen

1049.06 --> 1057.6699999999998
again and you entered the new region and

1053.5 --> 1060.25
yet the Sun from the other side has

1057.67 --> 1062.3200000000002
completely blotted out it's no longer

1060.25 --> 1071.05
visible and the new Sun from the other

1062.32 --> 1074.1699999999998
side coming visible maybe and that isn't

1071.05 --> 1077.68
a new Sun is it a separate Sun or is it

1074.17 --> 1082.14
just the same effect the lights they

1077.68 --> 1082.14
light effect like an oscillation because

1082.44 --> 1089.5
well you could say if literally

1086.28 --> 1092.17
literally the rectangular looping earth

1089.5 --> 1095.88
would be like the rectangular looping -

1092.17 --> 1100.0
well then it would be subject to

1095.88 --> 1106.15
oscillation sound-based oscillation for

1100.0 --> 1109.03
example say like the box of a guitar it

1106.15 --> 1112.99
amplifies the sound because of the shape

1109.03 --> 1115.54
of it so if the earth looping confine

1112.99 --> 1118.39
would be a rectangular shape then

1115.54 --> 1124.11
certain types of sound would perfectly

1118.39 --> 1127.24
fit within those special confines yeah

1124.11 --> 1129.79
that could create these points so maybe

1127.24 --> 1134.11
there is some kind of oscillation sound

1129.79 --> 1139.4099999999999
relation to where the Sun the daylight

1134.11 --> 1143.4299999999998
is basically the strongest over the

1139.41 --> 1148.0600000000002
regions of the rectangular looping earth

1143.43 --> 1151.0900000000001
so that's there you go you've got an

1148.06 --> 1152.34
idea right out of nowhere see that's how

1151.09 --> 1155.9499999999998
it works

1152.34 --> 1156.58
wow this is really interesting to think

1155.95 --> 1161.559
about

1156.58 --> 1164.86
it kind of fits I had a picture when I

1161.559 --> 1167.32
present it yeah I'll dig it up fits

1164.86 --> 1172.559
really well it's amazing that I didn't

1167.32 --> 1172.559
see it back then holy crap

1173.64 --> 1176.8500000000001
there's good stuff

1186.49 --> 1193.96
ha oh my god yeah it was in my hangout

1191.14 --> 1205.51
about the antique waiter this is good

1193.96 --> 1209.29
stuff let's see there you go so here you

1205.51 --> 1211.27
got assuming the looping earth the right

1209.29 --> 1215.8899999999999
the rectangle east to west is straight

1211.27 --> 1218.71
but yeah that this could be also opening

1215.89 --> 1224.91
like this but yeah here you already see

1218.71 --> 1227.2
the the antique waiters the poles and

1224.91 --> 1230.02
here the equator where the Sun is the

1227.2 --> 1236.74
highest it is see it is kind of like a

1230.02 --> 1239.17
sound oscillation basically how the how

1236.74 --> 1242.46
the Sun relates in its strength and

1239.17 --> 1245.95
height or the the daylight over these

1242.46 --> 1248.41
regions and if the earth is rectangular

1245.95 --> 1255.1200000000001
looping then it really does look like a

1248.41 --> 1261.27
sound wave like in a chamber so yeah

1255.12 --> 1261.27
there you go another theory is born

1266.88 --> 1282.3600000000001
welcome to flatter sucks now yeah it's

1271.62 --> 1286.6499999999999
almost like one okay you asks if you

1282.36 --> 1288.81
step over the line left or right well if

1286.65 --> 1293.3700000000001
you step over it if you travel over it

1288.81 --> 1298.62
you end up in the other continent that

1293.37 --> 1301.59
is out there whatever may be there and

1298.62 --> 1304.32
you according to another theory of me of

1301.59 --> 1307.7099999999998
mine about the star heavens you might

1304.32 --> 1310.53
potentially have a new if you go to the

1307.71 --> 1312.54
north a new northern hemisphere and the

1310.53 --> 1317.91
northern hemisphere maybe the southern

1312.54 --> 1319.83
hemisphere there in that region until

1317.91 --> 1324.24
you get to the equator and it's no

1319.83 --> 1327.0
longer visible and you get another half

1324.24 --> 1330.57
northern hemisphere basically it's an

1327.0 --> 1332.1
entirely a li ya a new unknown set of

1330.57 --> 1335.97
stars you could potentially see there

1332.1 --> 1340.11
and yeah in the same manner in the same

1335.97 --> 1342.98
pattern like a chain of beads you see if

1340.11 --> 1342.9799999999998
I can find it

1356.49 --> 1367.6200000000001
I don't think I even drew it I just

1363.19 --> 1367.6200000000001
described it yeah

1372.91 --> 1379.8700000000001
all right here you know what I'll show

1375.7 --> 1383.31
another picture of the e10 you're

1379.87 --> 1383.31
looping from another angle

1383.73 --> 1386.73
so

1390.93 --> 1396.75
here in the middle is our the Earth or

1393.39 --> 1400.94
the our realm are known out realm the

1396.75 --> 1404.33
Middle Earth continents and then well

1400.94 --> 1408.0900000000001
however big this is going to be is just

1404.33 --> 1411.35
the four river mountain lands to the

1408.09 --> 1414.27
north and whatever is up there islands

1411.35 --> 1417.3799999999999
join or a pool whatever magnetic

1414.27 --> 1418.68
mountain I don't know and to the South

1417.38 --> 1425.24
yeah

1418.68 --> 1428.67
large chunk of Iceland and potentially

1425.24 --> 1431.01
unfrozen land and rivers ending up in

1428.67 --> 1435.51
the sea with more islands in this

1431.01 --> 1439.62
picture or it could just be a vast land

1435.51 --> 1443.67
with rivers and lakes basically and

1439.62 --> 1447.3799999999999
there's no oceans over there might be

1443.67 --> 1447.38
like that who knows

1449.94 --> 1456.81
but yeah another view to rectangular

1454.53 --> 1459.66
looping concept with possibilities of

1456.81 --> 1462.6889999999999
what could be beyond the poles

1459.66 --> 1462.689
[Music]

1478.09 --> 1491.11
oh god are you still on the freakin

1481.419 --> 1494.5900000000001
Logan please sister really so it's a

1491.11 --> 1498.039
nation you know you should just not

1494.59 --> 1503.85
watch his videos and just forget about

1498.039 --> 1503.85
it it's really not worth the energy

1520.4 --> 1523.0
see

1524.05 --> 1531.1
Karen B you're talking about Logan again

1528.34 --> 1535.6299999999999
right yeah look he's not a flat earther

1531.1 --> 1539.9399999999998
it was just a stunt it's almost straight

1535.63 --> 1545.17
forward trolling and he was still polite

1539.94 --> 1548.71
cuz I guess flat earth makes him nervous

1545.17 --> 1552.73
so he's not - yeah he's not too foolish

1548.71 --> 1556.54
to just like really start trolling and

1552.73 --> 1558.94
start misbehaving like that you know

1556.54 --> 1561.55
some people are just they flat earth

1558.94 --> 1563.44
makes them nervous instead of really

1561.55 --> 1566.1399999999999
pissing them off it makes them nervous

1563.44 --> 1568.45
so maybe he's one of these guys I don't

1566.14 --> 1574.0600000000002
know it's not doesn't really look like a

1568.45 --> 1577.3300000000002
brave dude you know so maybe he's just a

1574.06 --> 1579.78
scaredy-cat in general I wouldn't be

1577.33 --> 1579.78
surprised

1584.26 --> 1605.02
anyway it's not go away more interesting

1596.33 --> 1609.3799999999999
things happening right stuff malls

1605.02 --> 1614.06
discoveries new paths people are taking

1609.38 --> 1617.63
lots of new things people are doing my

1614.06 --> 1620.87
life I like it how of the Flat Earth

1617.63 --> 1624.41
debate crew I guess everyone one by one

1620.87 --> 1636.4399999999998
is taking up like a real project it's

1624.41 --> 1639.0800000000002
really cool and yeah it's it and curse

1636.44 --> 1641.54
people it basically really sets them on

1639.08 --> 1645.01
the set path and they can't just walk

1641.54 --> 1647.3
away without disgracing themselves and

1645.01 --> 1653.6299999999999
that changes a person

1647.3 --> 1660.28
for the better tends to it's like they

1653.63 --> 1660.2800000000002
grow up and this is cool I like it so

1660.88 --> 1671.39
and we get a lot more materials and more

1666.55 --> 1673.6299999999999
words more angles of approach that is so

1671.39 --> 1673.63
good

1685.1 --> 1698.4599999999998
so you know any one of you want to come

1689.309 --> 1701.28
on Karen B would you like to come on no

1698.46 --> 1707.3600000000001
settings you a link I think I got you in

1701.28 --> 1707.36
a skirt right yeah

1721.48 --> 1727.6
Karen Vicious your son hates Logan Paul

1728.289 --> 1731.289
yep

1735.19 --> 1746.51
but yeah the guy is a troll so it's

1742.58 --> 1749.32
basically just a social media clown just

1746.51 --> 1749.32
screwing around

1771.059 --> 1781.529
let's see oh yeah I got a new lamp

1776.46 --> 1782.279
ray come on so stupid not interesting

1781.529 --> 1786.72
talk

1782.279 --> 1793.769
oh yeah I must consider to get a chorus

1786.72 --> 1795.99
song at the at the organic supermarket

1793.769 --> 1800.159
here but they didn't have one with

1795.99 --> 1806.61
cheese on it so I didn't want to blend

1800.159 --> 1808.529
one costs way too much anyway okay if

1806.61 --> 1810.4499999999998
you want something cheap organic you got

1808.529 --> 1812.899
to make it yourself otherwise you're

1810.45 --> 1812.8990000000001
gonna pee

1825.22 --> 1828.97
it's an interesting concept thinking

1828.35 --> 1835.1899999999998
about it

1828.97 --> 1837.53
that could well in this case depending

1835.19 --> 1838.39
on this model which is very convenient

1837.53 --> 1843.98
for me

1838.39 --> 1850.3400000000001
yeah then again so Rd yeah think about

1843.98 --> 1853.58
it a lot of the dome disk based flat

1850.34 --> 1859.12
earthers that take that literally use

1853.58 --> 1865.58
the circle centric nature to use

1859.12 --> 1869.51
electric electrics and magnetics to find

1865.58 --> 1874.3999999999999
an explanation for what could be causing

1869.51 --> 1876.58
the aberration of gravity and magnetics

1874.4 --> 1879.71
and potentially the Sun and everything

1876.58 --> 1883.07
so yeah that's in their model but in my

1879.71 --> 1887.39
model I'm now finding a new relation as

1883.07 --> 1888.3999999999999
to what could be causing the globe of

1887.39 --> 1893.21
the heavens

1888.4 --> 1895.22
maybe it's sound based maybe these

1893.21 --> 1898.76
phenomena are sound based for some

1895.22 --> 1901.1000000000001
reason it's very interesting and you get

1898.76 --> 1904.76
the Word of God that brought everything

1901.1 --> 1908.9599999999998
into being also so and there is so much

1904.76 --> 1911.51
to sound so in so incredible a lot of

1908.96 --> 1914.54
things like resonance technology for

1911.51 --> 1919.64
example is kind of literally based on

1914.54 --> 1922.61
sounds it's like making the exact sound

1919.64 --> 1925.46
frequency that resonates with the

1922.61 --> 1931.7299999999998
specific type of molecule for example or

1925.46 --> 1934.25
a type of living organic body itself for

1931.73 --> 1937.299
whatever purpose to energize it to

1934.25 --> 1941.33
strengthen it or to destroy it and

1937.299 --> 1943.37
that's the freakin sound and we're

1941.33 --> 1946.46
already seeing what can be done with it

1943.37 --> 1949.82
like the California fires like the

1946.46 --> 1953.45
complete meltdown of houses and cars and

1949.82 --> 1957.6499999999999
everything that is resonance technology

1953.45 --> 1958.4
that is kind of sound based very refined

1957.65 --> 1964.16
weapon

1958.4 --> 1967.45
sound technology so who knows if you can

1964.16 --> 1970.6100000000001
do that with sound could you potentially

1967.45 --> 1975.23
with sound create in the right type of

1970.61 --> 1978.5
chamber a Sun and a moon and globe of

1975.23 --> 1985.73
the heavens type of effect it's another

1978.5 --> 1988.01
mystery so yeah maybe could maybe sound

1985.73 --> 1991.66
is involved and having the bodies

1988.01 --> 1991.66
something I've never considered before

2001.72 --> 2009.3700000000001
right Daniel says no we too much energy

2006.67 --> 2012.4
yeah well the funny thing Daniel that it

2009.37 --> 2014.4399999999998
is only way too much energy if you

2012.4 --> 2017.74
assume there's literally a ball of fire

2014.44 --> 2019.99
being it caused right there and that's

2017.74 --> 2025.6200000000001
not what I'm assuming I'm assuming that

2019.99 --> 2032.53
daylight light maybe originally caused

2025.62 --> 2035.3799999999999
by some kind of sound effect a certain

2032.53 --> 2038.47
sound frequency an oscillation or

2035.38 --> 2044.68
whatever in this specific chamber that

2038.47 --> 2047.71
is the loop in confine of our throw that

2044.68 --> 2050.53
maybe yeah we don't know what it could

2047.71 --> 2053.68
be may be extremely low or sets of

2050.53 --> 2058.7200000000003
sounds that are combined together that

2053.68 --> 2063.7
are perhaps subsonic but or on some

2058.72 --> 2066.0099999999998
frequency we haven't tapped into the

2063.7 --> 2070.5099999999998
usual woman yeah the skill on the

2066.01 --> 2073.69
spectrum we haven't dealt with yet so we

2070.51 --> 2077.26
don't have circumstantially the type of

2073.69 --> 2080.5
receivers required to even touch upon

2077.26 --> 2082.6000000000004
this or it's been kept from us for a

2080.5 --> 2085.03
good reason and technology's been pushed

2082.6 --> 2088.7799999999997
like now go that direction don't touch

2085.03 --> 2090.8500000000004
this spectrum because it costs more than

2088.78 --> 2092.9500000000003
early and it is because yeah that

2090.85 --> 2095.11
actually deals with the frequencies do

2092.95 --> 2102.66
they like patterns and everything so

2095.11 --> 2107.4900000000002
don't hey I'm joined by chocolate saying

2102.66 --> 2107.49
good morning good morning good morning

2107.7 --> 2125.1699999999996
you'll a party we just always up early

2117.66 --> 2128.5
so did you follow my little all of it

2125.17 --> 2132.0
I heard you gettin into the red

2128.5 --> 2136.47
rectangular yeah string model

2132.0 --> 2139.71
and I was asked about it really yeah I

2136.47 --> 2141.1499999999996
talking a little bit about I just I kind

2139.71 --> 2143.39
of just came on maybe like 10 minutes

2141.15 --> 2143.39
ago

2143.45 --> 2152.8999999999996
yeah those must be rectangular doodling

2146.04 --> 2154.23
talk then cool so what are you up to

2152.9 --> 2162.63
today

2154.23 --> 2169.71
Burton workaholic what do you do anyway

2162.63 --> 2177.6
I work for a solar battery manufacturing

2169.71 --> 2181.76
company so I am a tech and technician

2177.6 --> 2186.7799999999997
and building pretty much a solar battery

2181.76 --> 2192.51
assembly technician cool wow this sounds

2186.78 --> 2195.03
like a pretty cool profession yes

2192.51 --> 2200.3700000000003
because it's it's I mean I'm working on

2195.03 --> 2201.9900000000002
a machine died somehow harnesses the

2200.37 --> 2205.77
power of whatever the hell that thing is

2201.99 --> 2209.43
in the sky don't we call the Sun yeah

2205.77 --> 2212.16
it's cool I want to get more into the

2209.43 --> 2215.52
designing aspects of it see how it

2212.16 --> 2220.6499999999996
really works but it's pretty cool

2215.52 --> 2223.08
technology it is me and the ones we're

2220.65 --> 2225.14
building with it you can actually like

2223.08 --> 2230.79
it's the design for like homes you know

2225.14 --> 2235.1099999999997
so you can at the same time as you're

2230.79 --> 2237.98
taking in solar energy you can also it

2235.11 --> 2243.63
also captures the energy from the grid

2237.98 --> 2247.08
itself and you can hold on to it so all

2243.63 --> 2250.62
the batteries you mean yeah yeah yeah

2247.08 --> 2253.29
that's a good one indeed yeah but with

2250.62 --> 2257.0099999999998
any type of natural energy harvesting

2253.29 --> 2258.99
except for geothermal energy harvesting

2257.01 --> 2260.73
because that's constant you're always

2258.99 --> 2263.7299999999996
gonna need batteries for wind energy

2260.73 --> 2267.359
because the wind doesn't always blow

2263.73 --> 2269.52
and the Sun doesn't always shine though

2267.359 --> 2271.44
usually when the Sun doesn't shine the

2269.52 --> 2277.2
wind tends to blow more so that's funny

2271.44 --> 2278.55
how you can combine those two but yeah

2277.2 --> 2280.74
you're always gonna need batteries

2278.55 --> 2284.69
because sometimes it's gonna do

2280.74 --> 2284.6899999999996
something and other times the or not

2285.68 --> 2301.1
yeah so yeah I guess in like me and

2293.07 --> 2301.1000000000004
everything will always work here you

2301.79 --> 2307.05
cool

2303.83 --> 2308.24
yes sir shout out to the chat good

2342.66 --> 2350.0699999999997
Allenby is harmless I guess I mean he

2347.88 --> 2353.4300000000003
has his moments of being uh that that

2350.07 --> 2355.8
typical baller troll type guy but I

2353.43 --> 2358.08
don't know for the most part I don't

2355.8 --> 2361.5600000000004
mind him and he has shown to have some

2358.08 --> 2366.17
type of common sense when things about a

2361.56 --> 2372.2999999999997
spinning ball right yeah you know yeah I

2366.17 --> 2374.79

Z P or subscribing just half an hour ago

2451.089 --> 2465.68
so what's what's been on your minds have

2457.43 --> 2472.94
any wedding dreams or oh really my dream

2465.68 --> 2476.3289999999997
my dreams are a pretty thing I have to

2472.94 --> 2479.599
get into the habit of trying to write

2476.329 --> 2481.309
them down or something like right for

2479.599 --> 2483.92
the first five minutes after I wake up

2481.309 --> 2485.5690000000004
like there's all types of insanity going

2483.92 --> 2489.65
on through my head and then like I

2485.569 --> 2493.22
forget it after like I fully wake up you

2489.65 --> 2495.2490000000003
know mmm so it's like I don't know but

2493.22 --> 2499.48
yeah I'm dreams are usually pretty

2495.249 --> 2502.749
intense pretty crazy really fighting a

2499.48 --> 2507.049
lot of fighting

2502.749 --> 2510.3689999999997
yeah oh no that's because well I have a

2507.049 --> 2513.499
lot of martial arts [ __ ] in my head and

2510.369 --> 2516.23
yeah okay yeah I remember that I

2513.499 --> 2519.7099999999996
remember that when I was doing Taekwondo

2516.23 --> 2523.239
and it was very intensive in my mind

2519.71 --> 2524.539
yeah I would also dream about that [ __ ]

2523.239 --> 2527.029
yes

2524.539 --> 2531.369
literally choreographing fight scenes in

2527.029 --> 2537.17
my head yeah then the matrix came out

2531.369 --> 2540.049
yeah obviously I'm a big fan of anime

2537.17 --> 2548.299
and [ __ ] like that just as you can see

2540.049 --> 2550.46
by my avatar all right hey we're by the

2548.299 --> 2551.98
way we're joined by Karen B hello Karen

2550.46 --> 2557.119
thanks for joining

2551.98 --> 2558.95
good morning good morning Karen come on

2557.119 --> 2561.079
how are you

2558.95 --> 2571.1899999999996
we're great good how are you this

2561.079 --> 2573.619
morning I'm good I slept very well got a

2571.19 --> 2577.43
nice rest after that after that

2573.619 --> 2579.859
conference huh oh my gosh I've been so

2577.43 --> 2582.9199999999996
tired since I got back still oh and then

2579.859 --> 2584.42
get this last night both of my children

2582.92 --> 2590.33
were throwing up and then

2584.42 --> 2592.94
the night so I was so tired and I had to

2590.33 --> 2595.39
get up and like wash sheets and it was

2592.94 --> 2595.39
horrible

2596.35 --> 2601.7599999999998
in the middle of the night yeah yeah

2600.41 --> 2603.02
like they had already come to bed and

2601.76 --> 2617.5400000000004
they came out of bed they're like mommy

2603.02 --> 2621.41
I threw up but last night was better I

2617.54 --> 2628.81
turned off all the Wi-Fi and I slept for

2621.41 --> 2640.6099999999997
a long time you needed to do that yeah I

2628.81 --> 2646.12
wish I could be there's no Wi-Fi in my

2640.61 --> 2650.06
room I can still hear them zooming

2646.12 --> 2652.46
sometimes I think like it's like being

2650.06 --> 2657.89
of energy just trying to tap into me or

2652.46 --> 2660.08
something drive me nuts yeah I know what

2657.89 --> 2663.3799999999997
you mean it's it's like sometimes I

2660.08 --> 2666.23
don't know it's a weird hum or something

2663.38 --> 2669.25
that like doesn't go away it resonates

2666.23 --> 2677.15
with my spinal fluid it's really

2669.25 --> 2679.31
disturbing disturbing feeling yeah but I

2677.15 --> 2681.83
only have it really when I'm sleeping

2679.31 --> 2683.35
when I'm lying down I guess because the

2681.83 --> 2686.99
pressure is just slightly higher

2683.35 --> 2691.39
something like the pressure on it does

2686.99 --> 2694.1
seem to matter you know you've got those

2691.39 --> 2695.9
with yesterday's sacks of fluid you've

2694.1 --> 2700.0699999999997
got those sex of fluid inside your brain

2695.9 --> 2705.6800000000003
mm-hmm and you could make those sex of

2700.07 --> 2707.1200000000003
fluid vibrate in certain ways I don't

2705.68 --> 2709.1
know if it's your spine necessarily it

2707.12 --> 2710.06
could be the one inside your brain I

2709.1 --> 2713.23
don't know

2710.06 --> 2717.65
yeah I sense it in my spine must be

2713.23 --> 2720.45
other no way it's just the point

2717.65 --> 2724.17
interesting it's hard to figure out what

2720.45 --> 2725.819
it is but yeah I get something really

2724.17 --> 2728.52
weird yesterday like something

2725.819 --> 2733.44
experimental mentally and I actually

2728.52 --> 2738.079
tried to interface with it and the weird

2733.44 --> 2742.38
thing is I think it sort of worked but

2738.079 --> 2744.96
it was jumbled up what it was almost

2742.38 --> 2750.829
like I was getting to see packets of

2744.96 --> 2755.4900000000002
data in front of my eyes and Scratchy

2750.829 --> 2758.25
it was so weird to experience but it was

2755.49 --> 2761.97
almost yeah I don't know the mind is a

2758.25 --> 2772.74
weird thing but it got the feeling like

2761.97 --> 2776.73
it was computer data you try to

2772.74 --> 2780.3289999999997
interface with what with the sound it's

2776.73 --> 2788.4
basically a beam of information encoded

2780.329 --> 2792.0
it's pulses and yeah I don't know once

2788.4 --> 2795.21
you know something about it you just I

2792.0 --> 2798.96
try to adapt and I try to basically let

2795.21 --> 2802.41
it I cannot resist it and just focus on

2798.96 --> 2812.0
it and approach it like it were a stream

2802.41 --> 2812.0
of information good morning everybody

2813.589 --> 2818.7889999999998
welcome thank you very much you don't I

2817.289 --> 2824.46
don't sound too sure about that

2818.789 --> 2829.369
oh and yeah you in a good mood yeah

2824.46 --> 2829.369
great yeah I usually am

2829.47 --> 2838.6189999999997
have you guys seen the beyond the curve

2833.4 --> 2840.15
movie yet no yeah I saw a bootleg

2838.619 --> 2842.1600000000003
version of it a long time ago but I

2840.15 --> 2848.039
haven't watched the full version yet

2842.16 --> 2850.3999999999996
what do you think - it carat hmm it's

2848.039 --> 2853.2200000000003
all right I guess I mean it's

2850.4 --> 2857.51
I wouldn't exactly call it a hit piece

2853.22 --> 2860.3289999999997
but it's not exactly objective either it

2857.51 --> 2863.8390000000004
was really fairly fairly balanced fairly

2860.329 --> 2867.26
fair hmm I don't I don't think so not

2863.839 --> 2868.779
quite but she could have been worse it

2867.26 --> 2871.579
could have been worse

2868.779 --> 2876.74
well Alan not for nothing you do believe

2871.579 --> 2879.4700000000003
you live on a spinning ball so yeah you

2876.74 --> 2882.2889999999998
would you wouldn't really find it unfair

2879.47 --> 2885.2599999999998
in any way well I'm always interested in

2882.289 --> 2888.65
other people's views of why Karin didn't

2885.26 --> 2891.6800000000003
find it that fair well you know it just

2888.65 --> 2897.4100000000003
it really bothers me that a lot of these

2891.68 --> 2899.41
a lot of these articles or documentaries

2897.41 --> 2901.43
or whatever they try to use

2899.41 --> 2903.3489999999997
psychologists to discredit flat-earthers

2901.43 --> 2905.66
like they're trying to basically say

2903.349 --> 2907.6400000000003
that we're crazy or we think we're

2905.66 --> 2909.0389999999998
critical thinkers when we're not you

2907.64 --> 2912.68
know they just try to discredit us

2909.039 --> 2916.039
intellectually or men are discredit our

2912.68 --> 2919.64
mental stability rather than address the

2916.039 --> 2922.279
proofs address the facts of global at

2919.64 --> 2923.93
earth and I'm tired of it if you I don't

2922.279 --> 2925.97
know if you listen to it but I just did

2923.93 --> 2927.2889999999998
it I did an interview with BBC I talked

2925.97 --> 2929.6299999999997
to BBC for over an hour

2927.289 --> 2931.8190000000004
okay and I did it a very long interview

2929.63 --> 2932.96
they asked me lots of questions and they

2931.819 --> 2934.97
didn't tell me what they were gonna be

2932.96 --> 2937.16
doing with my interview well when they

2934.97 --> 2939.6499999999996
released it that's what they had they

2937.16 --> 2943.19
had psychologists you know talking about

2939.65 --> 2945.98
how people think that their critical

2943.19 --> 2948.02
thinkers when they're not you know it

2945.98 --> 2950.539
just that's all they do is they try to

2948.02 --> 2952.819
discredit you instead of addressing the

2950.539 --> 2954.9500000000003
actual issue and I'm tired of it I think

2952.819 --> 2957.41
it's a cop-out I think it's [ __ ] and

2954.95 --> 2959.39
so that was done in the behind the curve

2957.41 --> 2961.16
movie that was part of it so yeah I

2959.39 --> 2964.819
don't think it was objective I don't

2961.16 --> 2968.0589999999997
think it was not biased and I think that

2964.819 --> 2969.77
we're never gonna get a a really well

2968.059 --> 2972.17
represented movie for flutter there's

2969.77 --> 2976.069
until flat earthers make a movie with a

2972.17 --> 2978.9500000000003
allow like more serious detail more

2976.069 --> 2981.73
sciency explanations of details like for

2978.95 --> 2984.3199999999997
example the optics diffraction anything

2981.73 --> 2988.46
well in the end behind the curve

2984.32 --> 2990.8900000000003
yeah no no and they they attended a

2988.46 --> 2992.45
couple of experiments that Bob and Jaron

2990.89 --> 2994.6099999999997
were doing and they did some creative

2992.45 --> 2997.8199999999997
editing to make it look like it was a

2994.61 --> 3001.1800000000003
you know that it was just a big disaster

2997.82 --> 3004.1800000000003
and while Jarrod's experiment that he

3001.18 --> 3006.1299999999997
did do was you know not a successful

3004.18 --> 3008.3199999999997
experiment they made it look much worse

3006.13 --> 3010.1800000000003
than it really was okay and I don't and

3008.32 --> 3013.09
I don't think people understand how hard

3010.18 --> 3015.04
it is to actually go out physically to a

3013.09 --> 3016.7200000000003
location with equipment and do an

3015.04 --> 3019.05
experiment or take a measurement it's

3016.72 --> 3021.58
not easy it really isn't

3019.05 --> 3023.44
people keep saying oh go do this go do

3021.58 --> 3026.5299999999997
that well how about you go do that and

3023.44 --> 3027.7000000000003
you see how hard it is it's not easy is

3026.53 --> 3029.9500000000003
it no sorry Karen

3027.7 --> 3031.2599999999998
um I don't think they met Jaron look

3029.95 --> 3035.14
that bad actually

3031.26 --> 3036.94
because I think they showed that to show

3035.14 --> 3044.74
actually what you're saying to show how

3036.94 --> 3048.61
odd it actually is to do so I thought he

3044.74 --> 3050.77
did okay whatever I said it'd have been

3048.61 --> 3053.8
worse it definitely could have been

3050.77 --> 3056.38
worse I will say that the year they

3053.8 --> 3058.48
didn't completely [ __ ] all over

3056.38 --> 3064.12
everybody but I definitely don't think

3058.48 --> 3070.51
that it was unbiased I liked the mouth

3064.12 --> 3072.13
Powell and demands yeah well he's

3070.51 --> 3073.75
probably one of the few people yet well

3072.13 --> 3079.5
he is really like that though he did

3073.75 --> 3079.5
that to himself he tends to do that I

3081.42 --> 3087.57
don't know what he did but I know

3083.62 --> 3091.18
Martinez Ireland enough that he is just

3087.57 --> 3095.17
so conscious attention Chloe and he

3091.18 --> 3097.96
can't help it but just be really I'll

3095.17 --> 3101.9500000000003
tell you what he did Darwin the he

3097.96 --> 3105.6
demanded five thousand pound up front he

3101.95 --> 3113.02
wanted to be in 25 to 50% of the movie

3105.6 --> 3115.0
and he demanded creative control yeah he

3113.02 --> 3116.68
made some crazy - he really did do that

3115.0 --> 3117.28
that's why I saying he did that to

3116.68 --> 3118.23
himself

3117.28 --> 3122.44
what

3118.23 --> 3126.88
exactly did he do what did he demand to

3122.44 --> 3133.06
be put in there the money it was in 25

3126.88 --> 3135.13
to 50 percent of it okay and what they

3133.06 --> 3138.67
asked what he was doing he must at that

3135.13 --> 3141.13
time it was living prison in it they

3138.67 --> 3144.2200000000003
denied him the filmmaker I don't know

3141.13 --> 3146.05
right and so the only way that they they

3144.22 --> 3147.97
put him in there was showing what he

3146.05 --> 3149.8
demanded and then showing clips from his

3147.97 --> 3151.48
YouTube videos where he loses his [ __ ]

3149.8 --> 3154.09
but she puts out there in public for

3151.48 --> 3156.28
everybody to see it's not like it's not

3154.09 --> 3159.3500000000004
like there was some secret that they

3156.28 --> 3162.51
found I mean that's what he does right

3159.35 --> 3162.5099999999998
[Music]

3168.9 --> 3175.36
right but Jaron was apparently portrayed

3172.93 --> 3178.0299999999997
fairly in else

3175.36 --> 3179.71
well Jaron wasn't Jaron wasn't happy

3178.03 --> 3182.4700000000003
with that film he wasn't happy with how

3179.71 --> 3184.66
they showed the experiment he you know

3182.47 --> 3185.8599999999997
he because he was really there he knows

3184.66 --> 3187.5099999999998
what really happened and he doesn't

3185.86 --> 3188.44
think that they portrayed that fairly

3187.51 --> 3190.2400000000002
mm-hmm

3188.44 --> 3191.83
you know I wasn't there I can't say I

3190.24 --> 3193.75
can only go by what Jaron says but I

3191.83 --> 3197.17
know that Jaron is pretty stand-up guy

3193.75 --> 3206.13
he's very honest so I would come to

3197.17 --> 3209.44
believe Jaron he's very you know this is

3206.13 --> 3213.4300000000003
what about the the line they included

3209.44 --> 3217.41
from Bob about if they release the ring

3213.43 --> 3221.5
laser gyro results it would be all over

3217.41 --> 3225.52
no that's not true yeah that's not true

3221.5 --> 3228.37
because it look at a ring laser gyro is

3225.52 --> 3231.04
not a gyroscope it's light what it

3228.37 --> 3233.68
proves is that the ether spin that's

3231.04 --> 3238.09
what you can derive from that not not

3233.68 --> 3242.83
the earth because there's not a physical

3238.09 --> 3246.52
thing being being gyroscope the thing

3242.83 --> 3248.62
with the ring laser gyro is the test

3246.52 --> 3251.62
that they did if you look at just the

3248.62 --> 3254.3199999999997
raw data it it does

3251.62 --> 3255.94
indicate some sort of rotation right but

3254.32 --> 3257.86
here's the thing it's not consistent

3255.94 --> 3261.19
rotation and it doesn't even always go

3257.86 --> 3263.35
in the right direction so and that it

3261.19 --> 3267.79
that data has been released it's not

3263.35 --> 3269.14
like it's a big secret but it doesn't

3267.79 --> 3271.72
show anything consistent with the

3269.14 --> 3274.18
globular model so it's that's why it

3271.72 --> 3276.22
hasn't become a thing because it doesn't

3274.18 --> 3279.16
show anything that proves the globe

3276.22 --> 3280.48
it just shows inconsistent readings they

3279.16 --> 3283.6
don't really know what's causing the

3280.48 --> 3290.26
rotation all right we tell you think

3283.6 --> 3293.02
it's the no it's not consistent it's not

3290.26 --> 3294.7900000000004
consistent it's not consistent with you

3293.02 --> 3296.32
know latitude it's not consistent with

3294.79 --> 3298.24
the rate the earth is supposed to spin

3296.32 --> 3301.03
and sometimes it went the other way

3298.24 --> 3304.54
no I'm not disputing that absolutely but

3301.03 --> 3307.5400000000004
I was wondering if it had a clue or if

3304.54 --> 3310.2599999999998
you had come to conclusion that it may

3307.54 --> 3313.45
be because of the spin of the ether oh

3310.26 --> 3315.76
that's what that's the theory yeah yeah

3313.45 --> 3319.5099999999998
exactly yeah I heard I thought it was

3315.76 --> 3322.4500000000003
very plausible has it cost I think so -

3319.51 --> 3324.8500000000004
I think so - absolutely

3322.45 --> 3325.39
was the was the information being

3324.85 --> 3328.48
released

3325.39 --> 3332.7999999999997
Karen oh of interest where's it been

3328.48 --> 3333.7
released um I don't know it's been

3332.8 --> 3337.6800000000003
around for a while

3333.7 --> 3340.48
oh just like look at it especially the

3337.68 --> 3344.47
data that suggests is going by which so

3340.48 --> 3348.73
be quite interesting I hate to break it

3344.47 --> 3351.22
to you guys but like the the show is

3348.73 --> 3351.55
pretty much over its we're just getting

3351.22 --> 3354.0699999999997
going

3351.55 --> 3358.2400000000002
I know I know but yeah it's a one hour

3354.07 --> 3360.7000000000003
show and time for Flat Earth debates

3358.24 --> 3362.2599999999998
yeah oh is it time to listen to the

3360.7 --> 3365.7999999999997
shouting man yeah

3362.26 --> 3366.96
the shouting man where's your proof mr.

3365.8 --> 3372.4300000000003
curve

3366.96 --> 3377.23
where's your win over here but anyway

3372.43 --> 3379.54
yeah thank you all for coming though in

3395.98 --> 3401.319
maybe you cellphone car anymore don't

3400.27 --> 3403.329
shout as much

thumbs up if you liked it and I will see

3485.859 --> 3492.21
you on the debates and on the flat earth

3488.829 --> 3499.1400000000003
early-bird number 15 tomorrow

3492.21 --> 3499.14
