starting late

87.6 --> 90.24
these days

91.36 --> 95.36
yeah

92.24 --> 97.28
doing groceries early because i kind of

95.36 --> 99.68
like this

97.28 --> 102.159
kind of wakes me up too you know with

99.68 --> 103.119
going through the cold and all that

102.159 --> 104.799
so

103.119 --> 108.479
but yeah it took a

104.799 --> 108.47900000000001
yeah a little bit of time more

109.84 --> 112.399
so yeah

113.119 --> 116.32
but i am here

116.88 --> 119.67999999999999
all right so the weather today is uh

118.799 --> 121.2
yeah

119.68 --> 125.43900000000001
completely different

121.2 --> 125.43900000000001
it's not clear blue skies and

126.88 --> 132.4
it's not really a gray soup it's just

130.08 --> 134.64000000000001
but it's a pretty thick cloud pack up

132.4 --> 134.64000000000001
there

134.72 --> 141.35999999999999
you can still see the sun

138.0 --> 143.52
barely coming through but

141.36 --> 146.64000000000001
yeah and it seems that there's plenty of

143.52 --> 148.87900000000002
moist in the air too

146.64 --> 151.44
it's at ground level it is a little bit

148.879 --> 151.44
misty

151.519 --> 156.08
all right

153.519 --> 158.16
no wind again there seems to be very

156.08 --> 161.04000000000002
little wind in the

158.16 --> 161.04
last few days

161.519 --> 168.59900000000002
and yeah kind of glad of it because that

163.68 --> 168.59900000000002
would make it a lot colder even so

170.64 --> 174.64
but yeah it's probably still freezing

174.8 --> 181.48000000000002
hello jeff gas at first in chat

177.92 --> 181.48
good to see you

184.239 --> 191.48000000000002
it is

185.68 --> 191.48000000000002
thursday the 23rd of december 2021

193.44 --> 197.0
and temperature

198.239 --> 202.31900000000002
oh it's three degrees

200.0 --> 205.599
huh well that did their prediction

202.319 --> 205.599
certainly didn't come true

205.76 --> 210.239
wow

207.92 --> 212.79899999999998
like today

210.239 --> 217.04
it's complete like

212.799 --> 217.04000000000002
the the forecast is completely different

220.319 --> 225.319
that's just weird

222.319 --> 225.319
right

226.239 --> 231.84
somewhere in between

228.879 --> 231.84
three and nine

232.799 --> 238.08
it's going to be today according to this

234.799 --> 238.08
forecast all right

239.28 --> 243.28
yeah

240.4 --> 245.20000000000002
nearly christmas indeed

243.28 --> 247.76
uh-huh i've been

245.2 --> 250.159
but yeah when i went out for groceries i

247.76 --> 252.159
thought like what the

250.159 --> 254.56
because like the first job i tried to

252.159 --> 256.88
stock up on some tobacco

254.56 --> 258.799
and like the store was like yeah we're

256.88 --> 260.0
we're not essential we're not allowed to

258.799 --> 262.4
sell

260.0 --> 264.32
but i was still able to walk into the

262.4 --> 266.56
store and the woman

264.32 --> 269.12
was in the store so it was just like

266.56 --> 271.759
what do you mean you're not allowed to

269.12 --> 273.04
say you're open like why are you open

271.759 --> 275.759
then

273.04 --> 278.72
and i just got like this feeling like

275.759 --> 280.08000000000004
what the hell is this like i was afraid

278.72 --> 281.199
that all the stores were going to be

280.08 --> 283.68
closed

281.199 --> 286.0
but didn't turn out to be the case thank

283.68 --> 288.639
god

286.0 --> 291.12
i went to another tobacco store

288.639 --> 293.44
this they were simply having like a a

291.12 --> 295.52
windowsill so they opened the door at

293.44 --> 297.759
the table in front of the door and we're

295.52 --> 299.68
like yeah we have to do it like this but

297.759 --> 302.08000000000004
we're still open

299.68 --> 302.08
okay

302.4 --> 307.28
so there is a new sort of lockdown

304.4 --> 309.19899999999996
nonsense going on

307.28 --> 310.88
luckily not like with grocery stores

309.199 --> 312.08
that would be crazy

310.88 --> 315.039
but

312.08 --> 315.039
yeah i stocked up

316.96 --> 321.28
and i'm pretty much set for yeah entire

319.44 --> 325.32
christmas time i think

321.28 --> 325.32
got plenty of food

325.36 --> 329.52000000000004
and smokes

327.28 --> 331.52
yeah just not beers i'm not stocking up

329.52 --> 332.96
on beers that yeah

331.52 --> 335.35999999999996
just gonna

332.96 --> 336.96
well maybe like first christmas day the

335.36 --> 339.6
store is still open i'll get like for

336.96 --> 341.84
the day after two but

339.6 --> 343.91900000000004
yeah i'm not doing that

341.84 --> 346.63899999999995
hello america silver patriot ralph

343.919 --> 346.639
rodriguez

347.199 --> 350.8
right but yeah the fir the first store i

349.12 --> 352.4
walked into was basically like yeah

350.8 --> 353.199
we're not allowed to sell you anything

352.4 --> 355.35999999999996
but

353.199 --> 357.28000000000003
why are you open then that makes no

355.36 --> 359.6
sense

357.28 --> 361.44
maybe the lady was just really confused

359.6 --> 362.8
and stressed out she did seem kind of

361.44 --> 364.479
stressed out

362.8 --> 366.319
she was even like i'm not gonna explain

364.479 --> 368.24
it to you

366.319 --> 370.08000000000004
okay

368.24 --> 372.56
i guess i'll take my business somewhere

370.08 --> 372.56
else then

375.12 --> 378.36
hey crockett

382.72 --> 385.6
well this dumbass at the moment well it

384.72 --> 388.47900000000004
wasn't

385.6 --> 390.319
it wasn't like that everywhere but

388.479 --> 392.84
i guess that some people are just really

390.319 --> 396.24
stressing out and others are

392.84 --> 399.59999999999997
like like you know sizing up store

396.24 --> 402.16
owners here is kind of its own thing

399.6 --> 404.8
and if they're like kind of simple folk

402.16 --> 407.03900000000004
having a store yeah they they can get

404.8 --> 409.28000000000003
very flustered by all this propaganda

407.039 --> 410.639
[ __ ]

409.28 --> 413.039
but

410.639 --> 414.88
other places they're like yeah yeah the

413.039 --> 415.919
government's crazy

414.88 --> 417.84
we're

415.919 --> 419.12
we got all these hoops we gotta jump

417.84 --> 421.44
through now

419.12 --> 423.84000000000003
but we're gonna try to not let it get to

421.44 --> 425.36
us and and we're definitely not falling

423.84 --> 427.28
for their tricks like we're not going to

425.36 --> 430.56
take the v or anything so

427.28 --> 431.52
like that's kind of the mix out there

430.56 --> 433.919
with

431.52 --> 436.0
yeah well where i typically go i go to

433.919 --> 438.0
people

436.0 --> 440.4
to stores where people

438.0 --> 442.72
where people work that are

440.4 --> 444.23999999999995
not like really don't

442.72 --> 446.56
because

444.24 --> 448.319
then they would probably just freak out

446.56 --> 450.479
a little by my appearance alone and all

448.319 --> 452.08000000000004
that so and yeah

450.479 --> 456.0
of course i go to a lot of the same

452.08 --> 456.0
stores eventually they get used to me

456.88 --> 463.44
so it's not i'm not like a guy that like

458.96 --> 465.35999999999996
goes to every store just to check it out

463.44 --> 468.879
[Music]

465.36 --> 468.879
maybe at some point i will

468.96 --> 472.56
but yeah not all of the world is a dumb

471.039 --> 474.71999999999997
ass

472.56 --> 476.56
but there are some that are just

474.72 --> 480.639
really don't know what to do with it

476.56 --> 480.639
anymore they just get all confused

488.16 --> 491.199
oh

489.28 --> 494.55999999999995
hello k

491.199 --> 494.56
kc no man

496.16 --> 500.72
voice to skull technology

498.4 --> 503.84
well it's not a voice though

500.72 --> 503.84000000000003
it's kind of like a

504.08 --> 509.44
an off hum

507.12 --> 510.72
or like a pee

509.44 --> 513.279
it's not like

510.72 --> 514.8000000000001
there's no there's no voices in my in my

513.279 --> 516.64
head being projected thank god that

514.8 --> 519.279
would be crazy

516.64 --> 523.039
but yeah i've heard of that that that's

519.279 --> 523.039
even existed for a long time

523.919 --> 527.6
like a device would sit somewhere you

526.32 --> 529.279
wouldn't hear anything and then if

527.6 --> 532.0
you're exactly in the right spot you

529.279 --> 534.399
suddenly heard music

532.0 --> 536.72
right in your head or your hair's like a

534.399 --> 536.72
voice

536.8 --> 542.24
i know that that exists but i don't

539.839 --> 545.519
think it's widely used because it really

542.24 --> 545.519
kind of freaks out people

546.64 --> 550.959
i don't know if that's even allowed to

548.399 --> 553.279
be used officially out there it's not

550.959 --> 555.279
like standardized at least

553.279 --> 557.68
let's keep it that way it'll be really

555.279 --> 559.36
messed up

557.68 --> 561.92
i wouldn't like want to walk through

559.36 --> 563.6800000000001
every store and then hear some kind of

561.92 --> 567.68
voice or

563.68 --> 567.68
thing being projected in my head

567.76 --> 574.24
because yeah that would be really easy

569.519 --> 574.24
advertisement and really invasive

574.959 --> 577.8389999999999
right

578.08 --> 582.72
would you like

579.92 --> 586.0799999999999
give me a call tell you how to stop it

582.72 --> 586.08
for free what

586.959 --> 592.3199999999999
what do you mean for

588.839 --> 592.32
free you start

600.72 --> 606.399
the world has always been a dumbass

603.6 --> 607.44
not all of the world but yeah the

606.399 --> 609.04
a big

607.44 --> 610.0790000000001
part of it

609.04 --> 613.1999999999999
yeah

610.079 --> 615.3599999999999
and it's like even the smart people

613.2 --> 616.88
that are like technically savvy or

615.36 --> 620.88
something they can still be kind of

616.88 --> 620.88
stupid in other fronts

622.32 --> 624.5600000000001
uh

627.519 --> 630.9590000000001
i i mean when i'm kind of like pissed

629.519 --> 632.399
off or something about something yeah

630.959 --> 634.88
i'll say it like the whole world

632.399 --> 637.519
freaking [ __ ] but it's not literally

634.88 --> 640.399
like that it's

637.519 --> 642.8
a little bit more spread out

640.399 --> 645.8
but yeah i know what you mean

642.8 --> 645.8
yeah

646.32 --> 651.12
right well hey yeah

648.72 --> 653.76
casey if you know something to stop it

651.12 --> 653.76
just say it

659.519 --> 664.079
especially if it's very easy just say it

661.6 --> 664.0790000000001
in chat

667.279 --> 670.959
unless you're just

668.64 --> 673.1999999999999
well selling something you have to get

670.959 --> 675.76
in people on a secret or something just

673.2 --> 678.72
say it

675.76 --> 682.88
right by the way that hum thing

678.72 --> 682.88
has not really been bothering me anymore

683.92 --> 689.0
since i well since i felt a lot better

691.68 --> 695.68
then i wonder like is the humming

693.76 --> 697.68
something i pick up when i don't feel

695.68 --> 700.079
good and then when i feel good it

697.68 --> 702.8
doesn't bother me there's like a natural

700.079 --> 704.56
thing that prevents that from

702.8 --> 707.1999999999999
getting to me

704.56 --> 709.279
i mean it might it might still be

707.2 --> 712.8000000000001
audible

709.279 --> 714.639
it's just that it's not distracting me

712.8 --> 716.88
right now in the night

714.639 --> 718.9590000000001
that's the difference

716.88 --> 721.76
like when i'm a lot weaker i'm gonna

718.959 --> 724.3199999999999
feeble or stressed out yeah then it will

721.76 --> 725.36
distract me and it will really get to me

724.32 --> 727.839
because

725.36 --> 731.36
i can't just

727.839 --> 733.2
put it in the back outside of my

731.36 --> 735.92
attention and hear it my hearing

733.2 --> 735.9200000000001
attention so

738.24 --> 744.44
no it's that's ridiculous

740.639 --> 744.44
it's not what it is

744.639 --> 746.88
look

754.32 --> 759.519
yeah no

755.92 --> 761.8389999999999
no just say it like what am i even gonna

759.519 --> 761.839
call

762.88 --> 767.8389999999999
just say it in chat what device

767.92 --> 773.8389999999999
something like food like what is it

776.959 --> 782.4799999999999
what do you want me to wrap myself up in

780.24 --> 783.839
aluminum foil or something or

782.48 --> 786.32
tin foil

783.839 --> 789.6
wouldn't be surprised if that would work

786.32 --> 789.6
but yeah i'm not gonna do that

790.079 --> 793.68
maybe like

791.36 --> 796.24
isolate my room

793.68 --> 797.8389999999999
like if i would isolate against mobile

796.24 --> 800.399
radiation yeah

797.839 --> 802.639
that might help i'm not really doing it

800.399 --> 802.639
though

802.88 --> 806.32
and it's not bothering me now

806.72 --> 809.2
yeah

807.92 --> 810.8
tinnitus

809.2 --> 811.6800000000001
oh right

810.8 --> 813.76
thought

811.68 --> 816.959
i misread it i thought you were saying

813.76 --> 816.959
tetanus but it isn't

817.92 --> 820.4799999999999
tinnitus

822.88 --> 826.6
i've heard of that before

834.56 --> 839.199
what they did

836.88 --> 839.199
dude

841.04 --> 846.8
what did are you

844.399 --> 847.56
are you that guy again that sent me the

846.8 --> 849.279
magnets

847.56 --> 851.5189999999999
[Music]

849.279 --> 851.519
like

852.56 --> 856.279
the [ __ ] is this

858.639 --> 860.88
like

867.839 --> 871.36
look it's kind of simple how this works

870.16 --> 874.48
for me

871.36 --> 875.6800000000001
when i'm not doing well

874.48 --> 877.9200000000001
like

875.68 --> 879.76
like i get over stressed all that oh by

877.92 --> 882.079
the way thank you kevlar for the five

879.76 --> 885.279
dollar super chat donation i'll send

882.079 --> 886.959
more that's nice send through paid

885.279 --> 888.8
polish if you can

886.959 --> 891.199
that really helps

888.8 --> 894.56
but yeah thank you for

891.199 --> 896.7199999999999
the goodwill merry christmas

894.56 --> 900.2399999999999
but yeah when i'm

896.72 --> 902.48
kind of like faltering and all that

900.24 --> 905.519
then suddenly

902.48 --> 908.16
the range that i'm used to applying with

905.519 --> 910.32
my spirit and my consciousness

908.16 --> 912.24
it suddenly becomes like

910.32 --> 914.48
a wildlands

912.24 --> 915.6800000000001
that's not under my control instead of

914.48 --> 919.36
it is

915.68 --> 921.68
and i'm not yeah i'm not surprised

919.36 --> 925.279
it's just my sensitivity so there's a

921.68 --> 926.8
lot of weird [ __ ] going on in the world

925.279 --> 929.68
like even

926.8 --> 931.5999999999999
ghost things for example like when i'm

929.68 --> 934.2399999999999
like this especially when fear is

931.6 --> 936.0
involved in some way like i can

934.24 --> 938.24
literally have sensation like there's

936.0 --> 940.56
spirits in the room kind of like staring

938.24 --> 943.519
with me with angry eyes or something

940.56 --> 946.6389999999999
right it's not really super heavy to

943.519 --> 949.199
hallucination level but it's like i feel

946.639 --> 951.92
something is there

949.199 --> 954.56
and i might see like maybe a bit of a

951.92 --> 956.88
semi-dark cloud or something

954.56 --> 958.4799999999999
but this happens because i'm weakened

956.88 --> 961.36
because

958.48 --> 963.12
when i'm just strong

961.36 --> 965.1990000000001
all of that might still be out there

963.12 --> 968.0
it's just not getting to me it's not

965.199 --> 971.04
bothering me

968.0 --> 973.199
right kevlar that's awesome

971.04 --> 975.199
thank you very much

973.199 --> 976.24
so

975.199 --> 978.56
yeah

976.24 --> 979.759
when i'm bothered about this [ __ ]

978.56 --> 982.0
you can

979.759 --> 983.6800000000001
think like oh irwin's gone all crazy or

982.0 --> 985.6
you could just think oh

983.68 --> 987.5999999999999
arwyn is now

985.6 --> 990.0
in a slightly weakened state so he's

987.6 --> 992.16
getting a lot of side effects from what

990.0 --> 995.68
i do you could definitely regard it as

992.16 --> 997.36
that that's kind of how i regard it

995.68 --> 999.4399999999999
and yeah when you're in it it's very

997.36 --> 1001.6800000000001
worrisome because it's like oh my god i

999.44 --> 1003.9200000000001
hope this stops

1001.68 --> 1006.0
because that's just

1003.92 --> 1007.92
you can't you can barely do anything

1006.0 --> 1010.24
when that's going on

1007.92 --> 1012.399
but then i always do get out of it and

1010.24 --> 1013.36
it doesn't even all together take that

1012.399 --> 1015.68
long

1013.36 --> 1017.519
especially when it's really heavy

1015.68 --> 1019.4399999999999
then it doesn't take very long it's

1017.519 --> 1022.399
either like a sort of like nothing

1019.44 --> 1023.9200000000001
really works smooth and then it lasts

1022.399 --> 1025.28
for a while or it's like this

1023.92 --> 1027.039
concentrated

1025.28 --> 1029.52
time where just everything just

1027.039 --> 1031.52
certainly piles onto you

1029.52 --> 1034.0
and everything goes wrong and like ah

1031.52 --> 1036.4
things bother you and you get angry

1034.0 --> 1039.919
but that doesn't really last very long

1036.4 --> 1042.16
when that happens so it's all about the

1039.919 --> 1045.2800000000002
swing the swing of the pendulum

1042.16 --> 1046.559
strength of your state the oscillation

1045.28 --> 1051.24
building up

1046.559 --> 1051.24
breaking down building up breaking down

1056.16 --> 1061.52
i regard it as a cia invention

1061.919 --> 1066.6100000000001
that's there to manipulate yeah oh

1063.76 --> 1069.85
really

1066.61 --> 1069.85
[Music]

1073.84 --> 1077.1999999999998
and you think i'm actually being

1075.44 --> 1080.24
subjected to that that i'm being

1077.2 --> 1081.52
specifically targeted by the cia to

1080.24 --> 1082.88
disrupt me

1081.52 --> 1084.32
really

1082.88 --> 1087.44
i mean

1084.32 --> 1090.32
would they really need to do that

1087.44 --> 1093.2
right you got to realize that ca doesn't

1090.32 --> 1094.72
just target people

1093.2 --> 1097.919
like they might

1094.72 --> 1100.559
push me over the edge or so or want to

1097.919 --> 1103.679
is that really that hard

1100.559 --> 1104.96
i mean are am i such a super threat i'm

1103.679 --> 1109.1200000000001
like

1104.96 --> 1110.72
displaying a range of characteristics

1109.12 --> 1113.52
and moods

1110.72 --> 1116.559
that aren't like already naturally

1113.52 --> 1119.28
misunderstood by a majority of people

1116.559 --> 1121.52
out there that will just likely think

1119.28 --> 1124.0
i'm crazy and that's okay

1121.52 --> 1126.8799999999999
i think i'm crazy too sometimes

1124.0 --> 1129.84
but i'm freaking consistent and i i pay

1126.88 --> 1131.3600000000001
a very close attention

1129.84 --> 1133.28
even

1131.36 --> 1136.6399999999999
yeah when i'm in a

1133.28 --> 1138.6399999999999
when i'm not complete

1136.64 --> 1140.96
when something is wrong i still pay a

1138.64 --> 1142.4
lot of attention right

1140.96 --> 1145.039
so

1142.4 --> 1147.44
am i really such a big threat i mean

1145.039 --> 1150.08
yeah there will be some people that

1147.44 --> 1152.48
realize what i am that understand what

1150.08 --> 1155.039
i'm doing how i operate and that are

1152.48 --> 1156.24
interested in in the results of just

1155.039 --> 1158.8799999999999
doing that

1156.24 --> 1160.96
what's coming out and how i feel things

1158.88 --> 1162.5590000000002
the structures i've revealed

1160.96 --> 1164.96
but that's just not going to be for

1162.559 --> 1167.9189999999999
everybody

1164.96 --> 1170.0
some people won't get the the structural

1167.919 --> 1172.0800000000002
insight they won't get the fractal

1170.0 --> 1173.84
thinking and even the dark world stuff

1172.08 --> 1175.84
especially things it's just not it's

1173.84 --> 1178.0
just dreams or he's just crazy or he's

1175.84 --> 1179.6
making it up

1178.0 --> 1182.88
right

1179.6 --> 1185.36
like why would they need to utilize some

1182.88 --> 1188.64
device to disrupt me

1185.36 --> 1191.039
because oh my god i'm so dangerous i'm

1188.64 --> 1191.76
such a public threat

1191.039 --> 1195.84
no

1191.76 --> 1195.84
fast majority people just don't

1195.919 --> 1199.679
they just think like oh this guy

1201.28 --> 1208.48
might be interesting might be crazy

1205.44 --> 1210.0800000000002
like they're not all hawked oh like oh

1208.48 --> 1211.52
my god arun what's the next thing is

1210.08 --> 1215.52
going to say it is going to determine

1211.52 --> 1215.52
everything we do or so that's ridiculous

1215.84 --> 1220.08
i mean

1216.88 --> 1221.7600000000002
in a way secretly i would want that to

1220.08 --> 1224.0
be like that

1221.76 --> 1226.48
but i know

1224.0 --> 1230.64
that it it can't

1226.48 --> 1230.64
you know i'm not gonna fool myself

1230.96 --> 1235.28
the only empirical result i have is when

1234.32 --> 1237.2
i'm

1235.28 --> 1239.9189999999999
being communicated to

1237.2 --> 1239.919
by people

1240.799 --> 1244.0
that are proven yeah that are just

1242.24 --> 1247.2
noticeably people

1244.0 --> 1249.52
and then how their life improves

1247.2 --> 1253.1200000000001
when they have chosen to engage with me

1249.52 --> 1253.12
and to try to figure me out

1255.2 --> 1260.4
those are the ones that i can influence

1257.919 --> 1262.159
for real because they're there

1260.4 --> 1264.4
right if they're not even doing that

1262.159 --> 1265.44
then how do i even know they understand

1264.4 --> 1268.5590000000002
me

1265.44 --> 1268.559
or anything that i do

1269.12 --> 1273.84
right so it just yeah i'm building a

1271.44 --> 1276.3200000000002
case here it's like it's very unlikely

1273.84 --> 1277.84
that they're cia

1276.32 --> 1278.799
coming after me

1277.84 --> 1280.3999999999999
i mean

1278.799 --> 1284.08
maybe in the past

1280.4 --> 1284.0800000000002
i mean i have kind of

1284.4 --> 1288.48
had some really weird contacts

1289.12 --> 1291.84
people that i knew

1291.919 --> 1296.48
and

1293.28 --> 1299.84
i was a blabbermouth and it was very

1296.48 --> 1302.32
overconfident zealous in a way sometimes

1299.84 --> 1304.24
that might have been threatening to them

1302.32 --> 1305.9189999999999
because even back then when i didn't

1304.24 --> 1308.4
understand anything that was going on i

1305.919 --> 1312.0
was just like trying to be a paladin

1308.4 --> 1313.6000000000001
like no it's not gonna work

1312.0 --> 1316.4
you can't

1313.6 --> 1319.84
uniformly get everybody under your mind

1316.4 --> 1319.8400000000001
control things

1320.64 --> 1326.5590000000002
and like i am not gonna be like that i

1324.0 --> 1328.48
might be i even said things like i feel

1326.559 --> 1331.28
that i'm being fooled right now

1328.48 --> 1334.0
partially but i know that in the future

1331.28 --> 1336.6399999999999
not too distant future i will

1334.0 --> 1338.32
be impervious to it

1336.64 --> 1339.8400000000001
i said those kind of things that might

1338.32 --> 1342.559
be considered as threatening but what

1339.84 --> 1344.72
have i even done other than just have

1342.559 --> 1347.2
this weird

1344.72 --> 1349.84
youtube career

1347.2 --> 1351.52
because that spreads around

1349.84 --> 1353.6
there's a bunch of trolls out there that

1351.52 --> 1356.32
are like getting all obsessed and making

1353.6 --> 1356.32
freaky [ __ ]

1357.52 --> 1363.039
but yeah i don't see the threat threat i

1360.72 --> 1365.2
really don't

1363.039 --> 1365.2
so

1367.039 --> 1371.76
so basically you are complaining was

1369.44 --> 1373.76
just your way of raising money

1371.76 --> 1374.96
no

1373.76 --> 1376.64
and

1374.96 --> 1379.52
maybe yes

1376.64 --> 1381.6000000000001
i was just being honest

1379.52 --> 1383.679
just hey i'm being bothered by this

1381.6 --> 1385.36
right now

1383.679 --> 1387.3600000000001
and and just

1385.36 --> 1388.9599999999998
like where what is that does anybody

1387.36 --> 1390.1589999999999
else have that

1388.96 --> 1392.4
my mother

1390.159 --> 1394.64
thought she had that maybe it is a

1392.4 --> 1395.679
family thing i was just trying to figure

1394.64 --> 1398.7990000000002
it out

1395.679 --> 1401.52
and hey if that

1398.799 --> 1407.1589999999999
draws in sympathy and

1401.52 --> 1407.1589999999999
and all that fine i'm just being honest

1418.96 --> 1421.3600000000001
strange

1420.159 --> 1422.72
growth

1421.36 --> 1425.6
no

1422.72 --> 1425.6000000000001
no i don't

1426.0 --> 1430.679
no my legs are perfectly fine

1446.24 --> 1451.36
right ralph rodriguez yeah there's that

1448.72 --> 1453.44
but i'm not the only one yeah flat earth

1451.36 --> 1455.039
i got flat earth in the name

1453.44 --> 1456.64
so yeah i'm

1455.039 --> 1459.279
downgraded

1456.64 --> 1461.8400000000001
through the algorithm fine

1459.279 --> 1461.84
there's that

1468.0 --> 1473.84
they like sit picking on the same family

1481.52 --> 1485.679
maybe

1483.279 --> 1485.679
i mean

1485.84 --> 1491.039
i i can't say that my family wasn't

1488.799 --> 1492.72
targeted

1491.039 --> 1497.48
it was

1492.72 --> 1497.48
we had some really weird experiences

1500.72 --> 1505.919
not violent

1502.64 --> 1508.159
but like mind control

1505.919 --> 1510.48
like some people tried to get in their

1508.159 --> 1512.48
face and all that and

1510.48 --> 1515.44
it was weird

1512.48 --> 1517.039
creepy like extra creepy now

1515.44 --> 1519.52
thinking back at the time it was just

1517.039 --> 1522.24
like oh adventure these people

1519.52 --> 1524.48
who what they believe in lucifer what's

1522.24 --> 1524.48
that

1525.6 --> 1529.76
yeah

1527.52 --> 1531.2
freaky

1529.76 --> 1533.76
i

1531.2 --> 1534.96
i don't remember who they were

1533.76 --> 1536.64
how they

1534.96 --> 1539.039
i think they

1536.64 --> 1541.5200000000002
i don't know maybe my mother was just

1539.039 --> 1543.84
hanging around some weird people

1541.52 --> 1543.84
she was

1544.32 --> 1547.6
and she was into the yeah the music

1546.559 --> 1549.44
scene

1547.6 --> 1552.24
so it's not surprising you're gonna find

1549.44 --> 1554.48
some really weird families there

1552.24 --> 1554.48
and

1554.559 --> 1559.039
i don't know man it's so long ago i

1556.96 --> 1562.48
don't even know whether that was like in

1559.039 --> 1565.96
the physical world or in the dark world

1562.48 --> 1565.96
i don't know

1574.799 --> 1579.36
they hate the truth and that means they

1576.64 --> 1580.3200000000002
will hate you oh yeah well yeah there's

1579.36 --> 1583.279
that

1580.32 --> 1585.84
i am absolutely a fanatic when it comes

1583.279 --> 1585.84
to truth

1593.12 --> 1598.4799999999998
but also just

1594.72 --> 1599.44
a fanatic about honesty right

1598.48 --> 1601.919
it's

1599.44 --> 1604.96
yeah because truth is so

1601.919 --> 1606.159
much and complicated and it is god

1604.96 --> 1607.3600000000001
like

1606.159 --> 1610.8400000000001
yeah

1607.36 --> 1613.84
but honesty is something you can

1610.84 --> 1616.6399999999999
do and that's

1613.84 --> 1618.24
like extra tough because the more honest

1616.64 --> 1621.039
you get

1618.24 --> 1623.679
the more inconveniences especially at

1621.039 --> 1626.1589999999999
first you will find because it confronts

1623.679 --> 1628.159
with the lack of on the lack of honesty

1626.159 --> 1630.0
in other people they will feel their

1628.159 --> 1632.48
lack of honesty in the face of your

1630.0 --> 1632.48
honesty

1637.279 --> 1641.12
anyway yeah

1638.559 --> 1643.44
i got some croissants

1641.12 --> 1645.279
slightly toasted but

1643.44 --> 1649.3990000000001
yeah i'm gonna eat those now i was

1645.279 --> 1649.399
really looking forward to it

1661.919 --> 1666.2
all right he say kc

1671.279 --> 1676.88
look i just think it's really weird

1674.88 --> 1678.5590000000002
that you would be saying oh just call me

1676.88 --> 1681.3600000000001
just call me

1678.559 --> 1683.039
oh i have this thing for you all

1681.36 --> 1685.4399999999998
just say it

1683.039 --> 1688.24
just say it you're not saying it that

1685.44 --> 1688.24
makes me feel

1688.32 --> 1691.2
you're applying some kind of a sales

1690.159 --> 1693.44
tactic

1691.2 --> 1694.96
even though you may be doing it for free

1693.44 --> 1696.96
maybe it's not

1694.96 --> 1700.24
sales for money

1696.96 --> 1702.559
maybe it's sales for a piece of my mind

1700.24 --> 1704.0
it's weird i don't like it if you got

1702.559 --> 1706.32
something to offer

1704.0 --> 1709.44
you just say what it is literally this

1706.32 --> 1712.72
this and that a procedure you can do a

1709.44 --> 1716.0
device you could use

1712.72 --> 1717.3600000000001
right you just say it that's what i do

1716.0 --> 1720.159
oh you think you can figure out

1717.36 --> 1722.559
something that helped say it immediately

1720.159 --> 1724.5590000000002
just there bang it's there this is the

1722.559 --> 1728.72
solution

1724.559 --> 1728.72
don't be like oh just call me ooh

1728.799 --> 1735.44
no just say it say it right there in

1732.88 --> 1738.7600000000002
chat you got 200 characters

1735.44 --> 1738.76
or more

1760.24 --> 1765.3990000000001
anyway

1762.0 --> 1765.399
this is nice

1770.64 --> 1773.64
so

1788.96 --> 1793.039
i can't do that it will take

1793.12 --> 1798.799
hours of typing oh really

1796.08 --> 1801.12
earlier in chat you said it was a very

1798.799 --> 1803.279
simple solution

1801.12 --> 1804.6399999999999
but apparently it takes you an hour to

1803.279 --> 1808.0
type down

1804.64 --> 1810.7990000000002
so does this solution involve i have to

1808.0 --> 1813.36
be indoctrinated in a certain mindset

1810.799 --> 1815.679
first and then it'll go away is that

1813.36 --> 1818.08
part of your solution why the hell would

1815.679 --> 1819.2
a simple solution take you hours of

1818.08 --> 1822.6789999999999
typing

1819.2 --> 1822.679
that's insane

1823.12 --> 1826.08
i don't trust you

1828.32 --> 1834.72
what you're saying is makes no sense

1831.36 --> 1837.84
anyway hello clutch ask and receive

1834.72 --> 1837.84
elise g

1861.36 --> 1864.36
hmm

1866.08 --> 1869.08
so

1884.0 --> 1887.2
oh man

1885.12 --> 1889.36
before this show

1887.2 --> 1892.559
i was also watching our own benjamins

1889.36 --> 1895.36
from yesterday

1892.559 --> 1898.799
about the polar express my god that

1895.36 --> 1900.799
movie is so creepy

1898.799 --> 1901.9189999999999
and it's really weird because i've seen

1900.799 --> 1904.84
like a

1901.919 --> 1907.679
reviewers kind of left this

1904.84 --> 1909.84
guy although i think he thinks he's not

1907.679 --> 1911.76
leftist but whatever

1909.84 --> 1914.0
he was really a fan of christmas and he

1911.76 --> 1916.08
reviewed that movie and he was like oh

1914.0 --> 1917.44
this is kind of creepy and okay this is

1916.08 --> 1919.6789999999999
kind of cool and that's kind of creepy

1917.44 --> 1922.96
and that's kind of cool

1919.679 --> 1926.64
and then just seeing snippets from it

1922.96 --> 1929.6000000000001
like the whole thing is so messed up

1926.64 --> 1931.1200000000001
and owen benjamin like really

1929.6 --> 1935.6
just shoved that

1931.12 --> 1939.039
right up there just like really creepy

1935.6 --> 1941.4399999999998
almost dark world like metaphorical

1939.039 --> 1943.039
experiences so it's like totally on

1941.44 --> 1945.76
target

1943.039 --> 1948.64
like that scene

1945.76 --> 1950.799
that messed up scene with the kid and

1948.64 --> 1953.76
the ghost on the train going into that

1950.799 --> 1956.72
tunnel and it's like a giant angry mouth

1953.76 --> 1958.64
and then he has to jump

1956.72 --> 1960.3990000000001
uh

1958.64 --> 1962.72
and then he like

1960.399 --> 1963.5189999999998
suddenly teleports somewhere in the in

1962.72 --> 1965.039
like

1963.519 --> 1965.919
with coals

1965.039 --> 1969.12
like

1965.919 --> 1971.6000000000001
that's so [ __ ] up like you realize

1969.12 --> 1973.1999999999998
that if that kid actually

1971.6 --> 1975.519
jumped there

1973.2 --> 1978.32
that means he would be

1975.519 --> 1980.96
smashing right in the wall and would be

1978.32 --> 1985.519
absolutely dead

1980.96 --> 1988.159
and then teleport it's so creepy ah

1985.519 --> 1992.3990000000001
you have to believe oh just jump to your

1988.159 --> 1992.3990000000001
death you have to it's so creepy

1994.64 --> 1998.64
yeah that movie is messed up

1999.12 --> 2003.4799999999998
just all of it's messed up

2017.44 --> 2021.44
oh nathan's daughter what

2072.32 --> 2077.119
you have to write a whole paper

2075.04 --> 2079.599
in order to explain how to get that

2077.119 --> 2081.599

2390.16 --> 2395.7999999999997
what are you talking about agent

2392.4 --> 2395.8
there's no video

2401.68 --> 2404.68
so

2434.96 --> 2440.839
yeah i just checked that channel there's

2437.119 --> 2440.839
no video there

2458.4 --> 2462.079
look

2460.48 --> 2464.079
this is real

2462.079 --> 2466.6400000000003
can somebody just

2464.079 --> 2469.119
post that video

2466.64 --> 2469.1189999999997
oh wait

2469.76 --> 2476.0
i see it now i think yeah

2472.8 --> 2480.92
you're right i got it

2476.0 --> 2480.92
well he looks really stressed out

2485.92 --> 2488.4
a real easy way to make videos like

2487.52 --> 2490.56
these

2488.4 --> 2492.7200000000003
um about half an hour ago

2490.56 --> 2494.96
while i was editing a video

2492.72 --> 2497.68
my youngest daughter clover had a

2494.96 --> 2500.0
seizure so her eyes rolled into the back

2497.68 --> 2502.56
of her head and then she was rushed off

2500.0 --> 2504.88
to hospital so i'm going to see her and

2502.56 --> 2506.319
pray and hope for the best but i'm not

2504.88 --> 2508.4
going to be doing a live show while

2506.319 --> 2510.4
that's the case so it will be a little

2508.4 --> 2512.0
bit shaky and

2510.4 --> 2514.319
uh

2512.0 --> 2514.319
yeah

2514.8 --> 2519.599
okay

2516.24 --> 2519.5989999999997
well sorry for doubting you

2520.16 --> 2523.72
yeah that sucks

2531.68 --> 2534.68
right

2540.4 --> 2544.64
it's horrible well

2542.0 --> 2545.68
it kind of yeah it's it's a shocker

2544.64 --> 2548.319
anyway

2545.68 --> 2550.319
i mean but it the seizure doesn't

2548.319 --> 2554.24
doesn't necessarily have to be like

2550.319 --> 2558.319
really terrible it could be more like

2554.24 --> 2558.319
it all depends on how bad it was

2558.56 --> 2565.0
like if she's like also foaming at the

2560.64 --> 2565.0
mouth then you know it's really bad

2566.4 --> 2569.839
or she's like

2567.76 --> 2572.88
totally cramped out or something right

2569.839 --> 2574.64
but anyway yeah it is a big shocker

2572.88 --> 2576.7200000000003
but it could just be a temporary thing

2574.64 --> 2580.64
dude i've had

2576.72 --> 2580.64
seizures as a little kid too

2581.52 --> 2585.04
it like once

2583.359 --> 2587.359
twice and it was really young and they

2585.04 --> 2589.04
were all really worried but

2587.359 --> 2592.72
when they came out it was just like oh

2589.04 --> 2594.48
yeah i'm just normal this is

2592.72 --> 2596.48
but that scared the [ __ ] out of my

2594.48 --> 2598.64
parents

2596.48 --> 2601.52
i think i was like

2598.64 --> 2603.44
five or six or something

2601.52 --> 2606.44
it was also during winter time by the

2603.44 --> 2606.44
way

2608.48 --> 2613.119
right anyway i hope the best to clover

2616.48 --> 2621.44
i'm not having like this ominous feeling

2620.24 --> 2624.0789999999997
so

2621.44 --> 2626.079
i think things will be alright

2624.079 --> 2627.3590000000004
but yeah it's a shocker

2626.079 --> 2631.319
so yeah no

2627.359 --> 2631.319
life letter debate today

2636.4 --> 2639.4
alright

2650.24 --> 2652.56
what

2653.44 --> 2658.48
parametric

2655.68 --> 2658.48
transformer

2661.52 --> 2664.72
okay the people

2664.88 --> 2668.599
that's very electronic

2697.92 --> 2704.44
yeah clutch no good call

2700.4 --> 2704.44
now balls is squirting

2719.68 --> 2722.68
okay

2753.92 --> 2756.2400000000002
now

2755.2 --> 2757.2799999999997
look

2756.24 --> 2761.1189999999997
it could

2757.28 --> 2764.48
be many things it could be a sign that

2761.119 --> 2766.1600000000003
clover like has tendencies to epilepsy

2764.48 --> 2768.319
or something

2766.16 --> 2770.56
would make sense because again christmas

2768.319 --> 2772.4
time all the lights everywhere that

2770.56 --> 2774.88
could trigger it right

2772.4 --> 2778.48
so maybe she has like tendencies to

2774.88 --> 2780.1600000000003
epilepsy some people have that

2778.48 --> 2781.52
and usually you find out as a very

2780.16 --> 2783.04
little kid

2781.52 --> 2785.7599999999998
when i was a kid

2783.04 --> 2787.359
because i had sort of an event like that

2785.76 --> 2790.7200000000003
my parents thought that was gonna be

2787.359 --> 2790.72
like epilepsy too

2790.88 --> 2796.7200000000003
but it really

2793.119 --> 2799.92
never went beyond that and by the way

2796.72 --> 2799.9199999999996
this might be weird

2800.24 --> 2807.2
i still have like sort like micro spasms

2804.319 --> 2810.4
it's weird but it like not

2807.2 --> 2813.5989999999997
never a seizure like that thank god

2810.4 --> 2814.7200000000003
but sometimes it's like

2813.599 --> 2816.4
like that

2814.72 --> 2818.9599999999996
it's really weird like

2816.4 --> 2820.1600000000003
like you just

2818.96 --> 2822.7200000000003
you just

2820.16 --> 2824.16
suddenly you i feel like i'm a whip

2822.72 --> 2825.839
being snapped

2824.16 --> 2827.92
and it's like

2825.839 --> 2829.04
i can't do anything to stop that it's

2827.92 --> 2830.4
weird

2829.04 --> 2832.079
especially like

2830.4 --> 2833.119
well when i'm trying to sleep that

2832.079 --> 2835.52
happens

2833.119 --> 2839.04
right i think it might be a remnant of

2835.52 --> 2842.079
that same thing from when i was young

2839.04 --> 2844.079
but it's just never going any like it's

2842.079 --> 2846.88
not sticking

2844.079 --> 2848.079
making me actually go like full seizure

2846.88 --> 2850.1600000000003
thank god

2848.079 --> 2852.8
like i've never had a seizure really

2850.16 --> 2852.7999999999997
since then

2854.4 --> 2856.8
right so

2857.76 --> 2861.6800000000003
but yeah it's kind of it's a shocker you

2859.839 --> 2864.96
know it's your little girl that's just

2861.68 --> 2868.5989999999997
too terrifying

2864.96 --> 2868.599
so yeah my sympathies

2873.599 --> 2878.1600000000003
i'm just saying it doesn't always have

2875.76 --> 2881.2000000000003
to turn out to be like devastating but

2878.16 --> 2884.2
it will always be a shocker

2881.2 --> 2884.2
right

2893.359 --> 2898.64
did i feel like i was falling no

2896.48 --> 2898.64
no

2899.2 --> 2905.2799999999997
no i more feel like i'm just a

2903.119 --> 2906.48
when i'm get like that with the shock

2905.28 --> 2909.52
things

2906.48 --> 2911.76
i just feel very intense it's like the

2909.52 --> 2913.52
tension like but in a good way it's a

2911.76 --> 2915.8390000000004
good tension

2913.52 --> 2917.7599999999998
but i still get like

2915.839 --> 2922.0
weird wobbly

2917.76 --> 2925.8
it's like it's almost like a manic spasm

2922.0 --> 2925.8
it's weird to explain

2937.52 --> 2942.319
but no there's no like special sensation

2939.76 --> 2943.6800000000003
like i'm falling or anything

2942.319 --> 2945.7599999999998
and yeah

2943.68 --> 2948.16
once i get to the phase where like the

2945.76 --> 2949.76
sheath come on comes over and i'm like

2948.16 --> 2951.839
really dozing away then it doesn't

2949.76 --> 2952.8
happen anymore it only happens before

2951.839 --> 2955.359
that

2952.8 --> 2957.52
if i'm like in sleep mode

2955.359 --> 2958.64
when you feel like the sheath is over me

2957.52 --> 2961.839
it's all

2958.64 --> 2963.92
easy and stretched and all that smooth

2961.839 --> 2965.839
then i don't have that ever

2963.92 --> 2967.839
it only happens when i'm still kind of

2965.839 --> 2970.839
awake like in my bad

2967.839 --> 2970.839
thinking

2973.119 --> 2975.44
right

2976.0 --> 2981.119
it had i had that was hard to deal with

2979.04 --> 2983.44
this kid right

2981.119 --> 2985.76
well if you have it multiple times

2983.44 --> 2987.839
that's really difficult

2985.76 --> 2989.28
like especially if you do it like in the

2987.839 --> 2991.2
middle of class or something and

2989.28 --> 2993.52
everybody freaks out and then suddenly

2991.2 --> 2996.0789999999997
you're like the weirdo or something

2993.52 --> 2997.599
or like creepy yeah that's really

2996.079 --> 2999.44
shocking

2997.599 --> 3001.92
if you have that

2999.44 --> 3004.4
but i just had it once

3001.92 --> 3004.4
at home

3004.48 --> 3009.119
never really had it since

3007.28 --> 3011.599
although i've always had like tension

3009.119 --> 3013.92
issues it's like if i'd prob if i had

3011.599 --> 3015.839
pushed myself over the limit in certain

3013.92 --> 3017.6800000000003
social situations then i might have

3015.839 --> 3018.72
gotten it again

3017.68 --> 3021.9199999999996
but

3018.72 --> 3021.9199999999996
i never really did that

3022.72 --> 3026.5989999999997
i was always very careful

3031.04 --> 3034.72
anyway yeah thanks kevlar

3036.8 --> 3040.079
you're gonna go away there's no flat

3038.4 --> 3042.88
earth debate so i think i'm going to do

3040.079 --> 3046.04
my show a little longer than usual

3042.88 --> 3046.04
to compensate

3056.72 --> 3059.72
um

3075.359 --> 3079.0789999999997
yeah merry christmas

3091.2 --> 3094.2
hey

3101.04 --> 3104.04
so

3130.16 --> 3133.16
yes

3142.4 --> 3145.4
hmm

3154.88 --> 3158.6400000000003
the noise stop

3157.359 --> 3162.04
what noise

3158.64 --> 3162.04
ask and receive

3203.2 --> 3206.839
there is a constant buzz but it finally

3205.359 --> 3210.319
stopped are you

3206.839 --> 3213.68
sure it's because of the video or

3210.319 --> 3217.72
there's no buzz over here it hasn't been

3213.68 --> 3217.72
maybe that's on your side

3256.559 --> 3259.559
so

3266.8 --> 3270.319
it is my pc fan

3270.96 --> 3276.2400000000002
i don't have one

3273.68 --> 3279.24
i don't have a pc fan

3276.24 --> 3279.24
like

3284.24 --> 3290.4399999999996
or maybe there's one in there that's

3286.079 --> 3290.44
still kind of doing something but

3292.079 --> 3295.44
like i can barely hear it

3296.319 --> 3300.5589999999997
then again my mic is kind of like

3304.4 --> 3308.079
no it shouldn't pick up anything

3310.96 --> 3314.96
there's barely any background noise

3313.119 --> 3317.52
coming through i can see it because it's

3314.96 --> 3317.52
just not

3319.359 --> 3322.799
going above this like the standard noise

3321.52 --> 3325.28
level

3322.799 --> 3328.0
just hang around there

3325.28 --> 3328.0
right anyway

3329.28 --> 3333.559
hello skeptic 936

3357.839 --> 3363.04
i mean seriously like i don't think it's

3360.16 --> 3367.68
picking it up like this mic can barely

3363.04 --> 3367.68
pick up my breathing from this distance

3369.839 --> 3374.64
i mean maybe it's not can't be

3372.4 --> 3377.839
resonating through the desk

3374.64 --> 3377.839
let me check it out

3379.359 --> 3382.359
nope

3403.44 --> 3408.599
oh god

3404.88 --> 3408.599
neil's all panicking

3440.14 --> 3443.23
[Applause]

3445.68 --> 3449.4489999999996
you

3446.35 --> 3449.449
[Applause]

3482.23 --> 3485.42
[Applause]

3488.96 --> 3494.239
[Applause]

3496.69 --> 3499.789
[Applause]

3506.92 --> 3510.099
[Applause]

3525.92 --> 3531.04
oh man

3527.04 --> 3534.2
neil's all really stressed out

3531.04 --> 3534.2
i wish

3540.09 --> 3543.1890000000003
[Applause]

3592.96 --> 3595.96
uh

3613.28 --> 3617.2000000000003
check the playback time you will hear it

3615.359 --> 3618.4
go away

3617.2 --> 3620.0
all right

3618.4 --> 3621.92
i might

3620.0 --> 3624.24
i've heard it before by the way it was

3621.92 --> 3626.7200000000003
weird like a couple of shows ago or a

3624.24 --> 3628.64
couple like two months ago now

3626.72 --> 3631.52
i listened back to a show and then i

3628.64 --> 3634.0
noticed it too there was this

3631.52 --> 3635.839
and then like it just stopped but

3634.0 --> 3638.96
even like

3635.839 --> 3641.52
me there in the show i didn't even seem

3638.96 --> 3644.88
to notice i didn't even hear that buzz

3641.52 --> 3646.72
or even hear it go away so

3644.88 --> 3649.119
yeah

3646.72 --> 3653.48
i guess

3649.119 --> 3653.48
some sound stuff does happen

3702.72 --> 3705.72
so

3724.56 --> 3727.67
[Applause]

3734.16 --> 3738.0789999999997
sorry for the silence i'm just trying to

3738.319 --> 3745.0389999999998
get neil to calm down a bit he's really

3741.599 --> 3747.3590000000004
kind of stressed out over this so

3745.039 --> 3747.3590000000004
uh

3751.92 --> 3755.839
yeah but it is a bit of a shock

3763.52 --> 3769.16
mount my mic on the stand we'll fix it

3765.68 --> 3769.16
no it wouldn't

3770.72 --> 3773.5989999999997
i don't think it would

3775.76 --> 3780.48
although hey maybe maybe you know maybe

3778.319 --> 3783.44
there could be this

3780.48 --> 3785.44
this arm for the mic

3783.44 --> 3787.839
remember like when is it it's not like

3785.44 --> 3790.16
two years ago i kind of wanted

3787.839 --> 3790.16
that

3790.88 --> 3797.839
so i could yeah have like a separate

3794.16 --> 3797.839
flexible mic

3798.079 --> 3803.52
but yeah never got

3800.559 --> 3803.52
never got anywhere

3803.599 --> 3809.039
and those yeah that arm thing was kind

3806.319 --> 3809.0389999999998
of expensive

3809.119 --> 3812.559
but it's still something i would like to

3811.119 --> 3814.319
have but

3812.559 --> 3816.48
it's just not really worth the money

3814.319 --> 3818.5589999999997
right now

3816.48 --> 3820.079
unless everybody insists and just sends

3818.559 --> 3822.4
me like a

3820.079 --> 3827.28
whole bunch of money for that but

3822.4 --> 3827.28
yeah i had did not have that on the menu

3832.64 --> 3837.5989999999997
it would quiet

3835.28 --> 3840.3190000000004
all my typing

3837.599 --> 3842.7200000000003
now you'll hear that typing anyway the

3840.319 --> 3845.839
clicky sounds

3842.72 --> 3848.16
are not just from

3845.839 --> 3850.48
like resonance or like

3848.16 --> 3853.1189999999997
vibration going through the table it's

3850.48 --> 3856.2400000000002
just that my keyboards are very clicky

3853.119 --> 3856.2400000000002
and i like it that way

3858.48 --> 3863.2
so they have a

3860.16 --> 3865.2
palpable and audible click

3863.2 --> 3867.839
that way i can just type completely

3865.2 --> 3867.839
blind

3885.599 --> 3889.599
banging through your stereo

3887.68 --> 3893.0
well maybe you shouldn't have it all so

3889.599 --> 3893.0
loud then

3899.28 --> 3904.559
i mean i listen back to my own streams

3901.599 --> 3907.559
it's not that loud george

3904.559 --> 3907.559
sanford

3934.0 --> 3937.0
hmm

3958.799 --> 3961.52
all right all right

3974.72 --> 3980.799
this is so very distracting did not

3977.28 --> 3983.799
expect to have a hangout like this

3980.799 --> 3983.799
uh

3995.359 --> 3998.359
so

4012.64 --> 4017.48
are nathan's kids jabbed i don't know

4020.16 --> 4023.839
i don't i just don't know

4024.16 --> 4028.7599999999998
they might be

4025.44 --> 4028.76
i don't know

4042.96 --> 4049.559
certainly hope not but

4044.96 --> 4049.559
i i literally don't know

4051.52 --> 4056.0
what do i think of the russian ukraine

4053.76 --> 4059.119
border issue i think the whole setup is

4056.0 --> 4059.119
completely ridiculous

4060.64 --> 4063.72
i mean

4065.839 --> 4068.24
yes

4074.799 --> 4078.0
i don't even understand the whole point

4077.039 --> 4081.119
like

4078.0 --> 4084.559
ukraine i don't even understand why it's

4081.119 --> 4084.559
a separate country really

4084.88 --> 4091.2400000000002
and it's been a giant mess

4087.92 --> 4091.2400000000002
ever since

4091.359 --> 4096.239
but yeah

4093.68 --> 4097.92
oh there's all kinds of issues of course

4096.239 --> 4099.759
i

4097.92 --> 4102.759
just gives me a giant headache every

4099.759 --> 4102.759
time

4104.88 --> 4109.759
but yeah i don't like

4106.96 --> 4113.08
ukraine's politics they're

4109.759 --> 4113.08
kind of gross

4120.0 --> 4124.159
and

4121.44 --> 4126.48
i don't know man

4124.159 --> 4128.96
i mean yeah it could just at some point

4126.48 --> 4131.04
it russia could just be like okay we're

4128.96 --> 4133.199
sick of this we're just taking over

4131.04 --> 4136.4
right now and they'll just take over

4133.199 --> 4138.799
ukraine in a day just like that bang

4136.4 --> 4138.799
over

4140.159 --> 4145.5199999999995
i don't know exactly might be a bit too

4143.359 --> 4146.4800000000005
but i think it might be possible at some

4145.52 --> 4148.2390000000005
point

4146.48 --> 4153.0
i don't know what's yeah

4148.239 --> 4153.0
and kind of trying to stay out of it

4162.56 --> 4167.6
what if you turn off the tell a vision

4167.839 --> 4170.96
there's yeah

4171.839 --> 4176.3189999999995
well look i still bump into it like

4174.0 --> 4179.839
through newschannel yeah rt

4176.319 --> 4179.839000000001
is talking about it all the time

4187.6 --> 4191.120000000001
but yeah it's just

4189.6 --> 4194.56
uh it's

4191.12 --> 4196.719
it's just that the whole thing

4194.56 --> 4200.56
it's so annoying

4196.719 --> 4203.04
and like politics everywhere is always

4200.56 --> 4205.84
[ __ ] around with that situation and

4203.04 --> 4205.84
everybody's like

4208.239 --> 4212.239
the whole rush has to blame for

4210.159 --> 4214.5599999999995
everything and it's kind of like they're

4212.239 --> 4217.199
propping up they're pumping up ukraine

4214.56 --> 4219.84
to supposedly be the opposer or

4217.199 --> 4222.799999999999
something like that and it's just all so

4219.84 --> 4222.8
annoying

4224.719 --> 4229.159
and i really wish it would just stop

4231.92 --> 4234.92
okay

4264.48 --> 4268.4
right

4265.6 --> 4270.56
so yeah don't really have too much to

4268.4 --> 4274.48
say about it i mean

4270.56 --> 4274.4800000000005
the situation is what it's going to be

4280.56 --> 4285.76
and i'm pretty sure there will arrive a

4283.52 --> 4287.6
point it's kind of part of my dark world

4285.76 --> 4289.84
visions too

4287.6 --> 4293.52
where russia is going to be just like

4289.84 --> 4295.1990000000005
okay i know we're done with this crap

4293.52 --> 4297.92
and they're just going to roll out the

4295.199 --> 4301.839999999999
tanks and everything

4297.92 --> 4301.84
and nobody's going to stop them

4305.84 --> 4310.08
i think that will probably happen and

4308.4 --> 4311.599999999999
it wouldn't be surprised if it happens

4310.08 --> 4314.719
because of ukraine

4311.6 --> 4318.159000000001
dude i've had weird

4314.719 --> 4322.0
blowback scenarios strongly imprinted in

4318.159 --> 4324.799999999999
my visions that are based on that

4322.0 --> 4324.8
it's weird

4326.239 --> 4331.12
like i don't even feel comfortable just

4328.96 --> 4333.76
publicly talking about it

4331.12 --> 4337.92
because it freaks me out

4333.76 --> 4337.92
and i'm not sure what to think about it

4344.4 --> 4350.28
so can i

4346.08 --> 4350.28
in the summer that is but

4388.56 --> 4392.8
right well look grand chaps you just

4391.199 --> 4395.759999999999
gotta realize this

4392.8 --> 4397.1990000000005
don't know if you're aware of it but

4395.76 --> 4399.4400000000005
every time

4397.199 --> 4401.759999999999
media starts to compare be like oh my

4399.44 --> 4404.0
god this could be like another cuban

4401.76 --> 4406.0
missile crisis and all the nukes could

4404.0 --> 4406.96
be flying

4406.0 --> 4408.32
like

4406.96 --> 4409.76
that's hype

4408.32 --> 4413.84
because it doesn't

4409.76 --> 4416.400000000001
nukes never go flying that never happens

4413.84 --> 4418.64
right there might be very powerful

4416.4 --> 4420.08
targeted missile strikes

4418.64 --> 4422.08
there's not going to be nukes there's

4420.08 --> 4424.5599999999995
not going to be like blowing up entire

4422.08 --> 4425.5199999999995
cities that's just never going to happen

4424.56 --> 4427.4400000000005
ever

4425.52 --> 4429.679
doesn't mean that there can't be like

4427.44 --> 4431.599999999999
really heavy

4429.679 --> 4433.4400000000005
wars

4431.6 --> 4435.6
where just suddenly like thousands of

4433.44 --> 4438.0
tanks come rolling in and just take over

4435.6 --> 4438.0
everything

4438.4 --> 4442.08
and missile strikes take out certain

4440.239 --> 4444.4
things and all that yeah that can happen

4442.08 --> 4446.32
absolutely right

4444.4 --> 4449.679
it could happen it could happen like

4446.32 --> 4452.96
somewhere in the next few years there

4449.679 --> 4454.4800000000005
over at ukraine but i mean

4452.96 --> 4456.88
i think there's a decent chance that

4454.48 --> 4459.5199999999995
will happen

4456.88 --> 4462.96
based including on my visions which were

4459.52 --> 4464.719
like very much moving on from that if

4462.96 --> 4465.679
yeah being a fact

4464.719 --> 4467.76
based

4465.679 --> 4469.52
on that

4467.76 --> 4472.08
if all that was rolled out in my

4469.52 --> 4474.96
experience based on that then there's a

4472.08 --> 4478.0
great chance that it does or rather it

4474.96 --> 4480.719
will actually happen

4478.0 --> 4480.719
so yeah

4481.12 --> 4487.199
but this thing has been kind of building

4483.28 --> 4487.199
up for like a decade or something

4489.84 --> 4495.1990000000005
like ukraine is kind of like the proxy

4493.92 --> 4497.76
what is it

4495.199 --> 4500.239
i don't even know like who's what's

4497.76 --> 4501.04
connected with all the parties the nato

4500.239 --> 4502.799999999999
and

4501.04 --> 4504.56
europe and all that

4502.8 --> 4506.96
it's like ukraine is kind of like the

4504.56 --> 4506.96
front

4508.64 --> 4513.4400000000005
that nato or

4510.8 --> 4516.8
you yeah europe is using

4513.44 --> 4516.799999999999
against russia

4519.199 --> 4525.5199999999995
but it's all kind of crazy

4521.6 --> 4527.92
because russia isn't being militant

4525.52 --> 4530.159000000001
like they're not doing that

4527.92 --> 4532.4
they're very defensive

4530.159 --> 4534.239
they're not doing that and like europe

4532.4 --> 4536.799999999999
and they they're all making out russia

4534.239 --> 4539.759999999999
like oh you're this evil invader

4536.8 --> 4542.719
constantly it's ridiculous

4539.76 --> 4542.719
they don't do that

4551.6 --> 4555.679
maybe ukraine needs to stay neutral like

4554.08 --> 4557.199
yeah but that's the whole point they

4555.679 --> 4559.84
don't

4557.199 --> 4563.44
they're freaking crazy leftists they're

4559.84 --> 4565.6
like leftist open nazis

4563.44 --> 4568.5599999999995
like

4565.6 --> 4570.64
they're not going to stay neutral

4568.56 --> 4572.320000000001
that's the point

4570.64 --> 4575.679
they're always going

4572.32 --> 4575.679
we're the special boys

4576.719 --> 4580.36
that's what they do

4592.64 --> 4598.4800000000005
like always trying to seek a fight

4595.36 --> 4600.48
all that always being loud

4598.48 --> 4602.879999999999
politically i mean

4600.48 --> 4605.759999999999
i mean i don't even know any people in

4602.88 --> 4608.2390000000005
ukraine at all so i'm not even saying

4605.76 --> 4610.320000000001
like oh ukrainians you're all just a

4608.239 --> 4612.4
bunch of ukraine no no no no i don't

4610.32 --> 4614.639999999999
know a new ukrainians i mean i've heard

4612.4 --> 4617.04
some weird stories

4614.64 --> 4618.4800000000005
thrown benjamin that you had some crazy

4617.04 --> 4621.36
situation there

4618.48 --> 4622.4
during certain hunger winter

4621.36 --> 4623.199
right

4622.4 --> 4626.0
but

4623.199 --> 4627.759999999999
i don't know ukrainian people i just

4626.0 --> 4630.32
basically get to see

4627.76 --> 4632.88
the like the news and political stuff

4630.32 --> 4636.0
and it's not looking good

4632.88 --> 4639.6
at all

4636.0 --> 4639.6
always like agitation

4640.64 --> 4643.84
always bravada

4644.96 --> 4649.76
i don't like it at all

4647.44 --> 4652.08
i think they're like a like

4649.76 --> 4655.12
in the world they're like acting like

4652.08 --> 4655.12
just agitators

4662.08 --> 4666.64
i think her left is taking over putting

4664.719 --> 4668.56
nato in there

4666.64 --> 4670.88
yeah

4668.56 --> 4672.56
yeah that yeah i don't know how far

4670.88 --> 4674.56
that's progressed but they certainly

4672.56 --> 4676.400000000001
have been trying that

4674.56 --> 4678.400000000001
they've been trying to turn them into

4676.4 --> 4680.32
like gay nazis

4678.4 --> 4682.08
or something i don't know there's oh

4680.32 --> 4683.84
it's always

4682.08 --> 4686.5599999999995
they always want to make everything

4683.84 --> 4689.360000000001
worse than people can handle

4686.56 --> 4689.360000000001
it's like just

4690.32 --> 4694.08
that's not ukrainian that's like

4692.96 --> 4695.12
nato

4694.08 --> 4697.679
europe

4695.12 --> 4700.4
globalism new world order

4697.679 --> 4703.36
they're always trying to like weaponize

4700.4 --> 4703.36
insanity

4703.76 --> 4707.76
and i think that they're definitely like

4705.84 --> 4711.56
pushing that on ukraine

4707.76 --> 4711.56
as much as they can

4723.199 --> 4729.04
they have their beliefs and take them to

4726.239 --> 4732.199
extremes can you blame them yeah yeah

4729.04 --> 4732.199
you can

4735.199 --> 4739.36
yeah

4737.52 --> 4741.360000000001
yeah when people take their beliefs to

4739.36 --> 4744.719
the extreme yeah you can definitely

4741.36 --> 4744.719
blame them for that yeah

4746.84 --> 4752.64
right people

4749.76 --> 4755.280000000001
or a people are judged by their actions

4752.64 --> 4758.320000000001
not their beliefs and if their beliefs

4755.28 --> 4759.759999999999
lead them to actions that are bad

4758.32 --> 4761.199
then yeah

4759.76 --> 4763.12
that's what you are

4761.199 --> 4765.44
doesn't matter what you believe

4763.12 --> 4765.44
is

4770.96 --> 4775.4
in the end it's the actions that matter

4782.239 --> 4787.04
so hold you liable to your own beliefs

4784.32 --> 4790.08
right yeah yeah that's right

4787.04 --> 4792.08
and my actions right

4790.08 --> 4794.719
that's right

4792.08 --> 4796.08
yeah i judge them

4794.719 --> 4798.0
as i

4796.08 --> 4799.5199999999995
demand to be judged

4798.0 --> 4803.0
that's right

4799.52 --> 4803.0
it's called honesty

4804.0 --> 4808.32
what you're afraid i'm you think i'm

4805.76 --> 4810.639
afraid of being judged

4808.32 --> 4814.0
judge me i get judged all the time i

4810.639 --> 4814.0
judge me all the time

4815.12 --> 4819.84
i'm not gonna hold back judgment about

4817.52 --> 4821.040000000001
something just because i'm afraid to be

4819.84 --> 4822.2390000000005
judged

4821.04 --> 4825.44
yeah

4822.239 --> 4825.44
ever thought about that

4825.76 --> 4832.0
right

4827.84 --> 4834.2390000000005
what was this saying again

4832.0 --> 4836.88
judge not unless you

4834.239 --> 4838.08
are willing to be judged

4836.88 --> 4839.76
yeah

4838.08 --> 4841.6
there you go

4839.76 --> 4843.04
that doesn't mean that you can never

4841.6 --> 4844.400000000001
judge

4843.04 --> 4846.239
that only

4844.4 --> 4848.32
means that hey if you're going to judge

4846.239 --> 4851.599999999999
be prepared to be judged as well yeah

4848.32 --> 4851.599999999999
that's right do it

4854.719 --> 4859.52
and my judgments are righteous well my

4856.8 --> 4861.360000000001
judgments are based on logic logic and

4859.52 --> 4863.360000000001
consistency

4861.36 --> 4868.08
that's right

4863.36 --> 4869.599999999999
natural order and god's laws

4868.08 --> 4872.84
and not

4869.6 --> 4876.88
some person's

4872.84 --> 4880.08
ideal laws or whatever no god's laws

4876.88 --> 4881.04
like the laws the laws of the design

4880.08 --> 4882.4
not

4881.04 --> 4884.719
some written

4882.4 --> 4887.44
sub-belief

4884.719 --> 4890.4
or some idealism yeah i don't give a

4887.44 --> 4892.4
[ __ ] about those so our mind constructs

4890.4 --> 4894.5599999999995
when you're going to that territory only

4892.4 --> 4896.96
your actions is what matters and the

4894.56 --> 4898.4800000000005
actions reflects upon the laws of god

4896.96 --> 4901.28
through the design

4898.48 --> 4901.28
so yeah

4901.36 --> 4904.159
yeah i do

4904.8 --> 4909.360000000001
my logical can be flawed well [ __ ] you

4908.0 --> 4912.32
then

4909.36 --> 4912.32
i don't give a [ __ ]

4913.12 --> 4919.28
if my logic is flawed then that will

4915.199 --> 4919.28
reveal itself and i will adapt

4921.6 --> 4925.320000000001
hello gadget inspector

4972.48 --> 4974.718999999999
yeah

4975.199 --> 4980.799999999999
that's right yeah i just brought it up

4977.92 --> 4984.719
that's right so that's okay yeah i am

4980.8 --> 4987.04
okay to be judged go ahead judge me then

4984.719 --> 4989.44
what you think you can find

4987.04 --> 4992.56
oh i can find the flaws on our wind

4989.44 --> 4995.599999999999
because he dare to judge

4992.56 --> 4999.4800000000005
a group of people and their actions ooh

4995.6 --> 4999.4800000000005
yeah go ahead

5007.36 --> 5014.759999999999
oh that's a great metaphor that

5009.92 --> 5014.76
absolutely doesn't apply to anything

5019.28 --> 5025.44
oh you never said i was oh well i was

5021.6 --> 5025.4400000000005
kind of thinking that you were

5025.6 --> 5030.2390000000005
because just of the way that you

5027.679 --> 5033.2390000000005
presented your text so hey fine that's

5030.239 --> 5033.239
okay

5046.96 --> 5049.96
so

5060.08 --> 5064.719
right well it's very simple if you want

5062.96 --> 5067.36
to judge

5064.719 --> 5070.4800000000005
or you feel called to judge

5067.36 --> 5072.719
then be prepared to be judged well guess

5070.48 --> 5075.28
what

5072.719 --> 5076.96
i was built to judge

5075.28 --> 5079.84
sounds kind of weird when i say it like

5076.96 --> 5081.52
that but i am

5079.84 --> 5082.84
i've

5081.52 --> 5084.400000000001
everything i've

5082.84 --> 5087.04
done

5084.4 --> 5089.839999999999
makes me capable of doing that through

5087.04 --> 5092.719
pure honesty and directness and openness

5089.84 --> 5095.360000000001
about everything almost everything to a

5092.719 --> 5097.76
level that's kind of unheard of

5095.36 --> 5100.4
i have an open honesty about myself how

5097.76 --> 5102.56
i work my flaws

5100.4 --> 5105.28
even my terrors

5102.56 --> 5107.52
my oddities everything yeah

5105.28 --> 5107.5199999999995
so

5109.44 --> 5116.5599999999995
i'm okay you can't judge me why don't

5112.239 --> 5120.239
you go ahead i'm not afraid to be judged

5116.56 --> 5120.2390000000005
and so i will judge

5125.52 --> 5128.96
it's not going to be always perfect but

5127.6 --> 5131.679
it's going to be

5128.96 --> 5133.36
as good as i can get it based on the

5131.679 --> 5135.04
information

5133.36 --> 5137.36
and my senses

5135.04 --> 5138.639
the information from my senses to the

5137.36 --> 5141.679
more subtle

5138.639 --> 5144.639
elusive information

5141.679 --> 5146.639
i will base my judgment on the best

5144.639 --> 5148.0
information available because i take

5146.639 --> 5149.84
judgment

5148.0 --> 5151.84
not as a tactic

5149.84 --> 5153.84
or as what could potentially be a

5151.84 --> 5156.32
political advantage no i take my

5153.84 --> 5158.8
judgment very seriously i judge

5156.32 --> 5162.719
correctly

5158.8 --> 5165.360000000001
i will never abuse judgment

5162.719 --> 5167.28
like even when i'm really pissed off

5165.36 --> 5168.48
like ren when like god trolls or

5167.28 --> 5171.12
whatever

5168.48 --> 5173.04
when i then like get really pissed off

5171.12 --> 5175.36
and i judge them

5173.04 --> 5178.719
i never

5175.36 --> 5181.679
pull it out of whack i never miss judge

5178.719 --> 5184.2390000000005
them when i do it i always bring in the

5181.679 --> 5187.12
real stuff and even give like open

5184.239 --> 5189.599999999999
options right there to them like

5187.12 --> 5193.239
what you can do about it

5189.6 --> 5193.2390000000005
that's what i do

5214.639 --> 5219.12
adjust judgment yeah well said chosen

5216.88 --> 5219.12
one

5221.199 --> 5226.32
hey see me

5517.28 --> 5525.04
i don't give a [ __ ] what he pointed out

5520.0 --> 5525.04
to some map that's all old news man

5526.56 --> 5530.6
it's all old news

5541.36 --> 5545.96
all these maps they're all projections

5546.56 --> 5550.56
i mean it's like

5548.32 --> 5553.5199999999995
been widely

5550.56 --> 5557.679
figured out and discussed a lot at the

5553.52 --> 5557.679
flat earth debates even three years ago

5558.4 --> 5564.638999999999
it's not new he didn't discover it

5562.32 --> 5567.04
it's not like oh look i

5564.639 --> 5572.2390000000005
figured this out i'm the first no you're

5567.04 --> 5572.239
a [ __ ] lying scumbag psycho

5572.84 --> 5577.4400000000005
jake

5574.8 --> 5579.1990000000005
and gadget is a fool

5577.44 --> 5581.839999999999
for holding on

5579.199 --> 5581.839999999999
a fool

5587.44 --> 5591.599999999999
e maps work all year round yeah but it's

5590.0 --> 5593.44
still a projection and it's not the

5591.6 --> 5595.84
scale so

5593.44 --> 5597.839999999999
it doesn't really matter

5595.84 --> 5600.08
it's not the skill it's not a euclidean

5597.84 --> 5601.28
representation of everything that's in

5600.08 --> 5603.44
the realm

5601.28 --> 5605.199
we don't have any

5603.44 --> 5606.879999999999
yeah

5605.199 --> 5609.36
we don't have any

5606.88 --> 5612.0
there is no maps that are actual

5609.36 --> 5614.4
cartesian euclidean representation

5612.0 --> 5618.88
representation two scale of everything

5614.4 --> 5620.48
in the realm there is no such thing none

5618.88 --> 5621.6
no projection

5620.48 --> 5624.638999999999
does that

5621.6 --> 5624.639
there isn't any

5624.719 --> 5631.36
so this false dichotomy is nonsense

5628.48 --> 5634.08
oh this map versus that method it's all

5631.36 --> 5636.48
wrong all the maps are wrong

5634.08 --> 5639.5199999999995
well they're useful because they're a

5636.48 --> 5641.28
projection you can use them to explore

5639.52 --> 5645.120000000001
they're not

5641.28 --> 5646.8
accurate representation of the terrain

5645.12 --> 5650.12
to scale

5646.8 --> 5650.12
they're not

5659.24 --> 5662.34
[Applause]

5667.679 --> 5671.28
i don't give a [ __ ] gadget inspector get

5670.4 --> 5673.599999999999

5671.28 --> 5675.759999999999
stop whining him about him or i'm taking

5673.6 --> 5678.56

5694.32 --> 5698.0
start trolling

5695.84 --> 5700.719
spamming people about flute earth with

5698.0 --> 5702.4
all the rage yeah and he turned out to

5700.719 --> 5704.96
be a complete

5702.4 --> 5711.08
scumbag monster

5704.96 --> 5711.08
and a traitor and a liar and so is jake

5714.159 --> 5719.839999999999
selling a fake map no

5717.28 --> 5721.599999999999
it's not a fake map

5719.84 --> 5722.88
it's just a map

5721.6 --> 5727.719
it's a map

5722.88 --> 5727.719
it's a projection like all maps

5738.639 --> 5741.6
what did jake lie about he lies about

5740.48 --> 5745.5199999999995
everything

5741.6 --> 5749.1990000000005
lies about people he makes up [ __ ]

5745.52 --> 5751.76
oh so when you troll and you spread out

5749.199 --> 5755.759999999999
false accusations and ridiculous

5751.76 --> 5760.719
paranoid fantasies about people

5755.76 --> 5760.719
that's not lying yeah it is it is

5762.639 --> 5767.679
that is lying

5764.56 --> 5771.119000000001

5771.119 --> 5777.32
yeah that's lying scumbag it's lying

5788.719 --> 5793.04
i wonder if he even still knows the

5790.56 --> 5793.04
difference

5794.56 --> 5799.84
any specific lie no i don't watch his

5797.36 --> 5799.839999999999
[ __ ]

5800.159 --> 5804.48
last every time i watch anything about

5802.32 --> 5807.119
him it just immediately makes me want to

5804.48 --> 5809.199
throw up i can't even get to the point

5807.119 --> 5812.5599999999995
where i can analyze what he's doing

5809.199 --> 5816.638999999999
because his sheer radiance is so

5812.56 --> 5818.8
incredibly toxic it makes me physically

5816.639 --> 5822.56
want to throw up

5818.8 --> 5823.92
and that's watching it through a screen

5822.56 --> 5826.88
yeah

5823.92 --> 5829.36
you want to get specific you go dig into

5826.88 --> 5830.400000000001
what he does george sanford good luck

5829.36 --> 5832.159
with that

5830.4 --> 5834.32
have fun

5832.159 --> 5836.799999999999
yeah i don't want to know about it it

5834.32 --> 5840.759999999999
disgusts me everything about him

5836.8 --> 5840.76
disgusts me

5863.679 --> 5866.8
can't have a 20

5865.76 --> 5868.719
hours

5866.8 --> 5870.88
of sun

5868.719 --> 5870.88
in

5874.96 --> 5877.52
okay

5877.6 --> 5881.6
well

5878.96 --> 5883.92
yeah whatever

5881.6 --> 5885.84
you know the sun is not

5883.92 --> 5887.92
a literal lamp

5885.84 --> 5889.6
at a specific height hovering over a

5887.92 --> 5890.88
disk

5889.6 --> 5892.88
so

5890.88 --> 5894.639
that doesn't even have anything to do

5892.88 --> 5897.119
with the map

5894.639 --> 5901.1990000000005
right when you're gonna go like all the

5897.119 --> 5905.119
the sun on the map oh oh really map map

5901.199 --> 5906.4
where exactly on the map is the sun oh

5905.119 --> 5909.199
wait

5906.4 --> 5910.4
it's a projected representation of the

5909.199 --> 5913.04
terrain

5910.4 --> 5916.08
it has nothing to do

5913.04 --> 5918.88
with positions of sun yeah

5916.08 --> 5920.08
the system is derived from the celestial

5918.88 --> 5920.88
angles

5920.08 --> 5924.32
it's

5920.88 --> 5928.32
about the land

5924.32 --> 5931.599999999999
you're talking about models

5928.32 --> 5934.0
the ae model something with the sun

5931.6 --> 5936.96
doesn't work out has nothing to do with

5934.0 --> 5943.239
the map the map is a map

5936.96 --> 5943.2390000000005
you don't have a son on a map it's a map

5962.56 --> 5965.56
oh

5997.28 --> 6001.599999999999
i don't care george sanford i don't care

by surface

6077.52 --> 6082.159000000001
i don't even have to freaking read his

6079.92 --> 6084.2390000000005
material for crying out loud to know

6082.159 --> 6087.04
that everything he digs through

6084.239 --> 6089.119
it's all old news

6087.04 --> 6092.56
all that shit's all been uncovered like

6089.119 --> 6095.04
three four years ago

6092.56 --> 6095.04
he's just

6100.239 --> 6104.48
you want to talk mechanics talk

6102.0 --> 6105.6
mechanics talk to me

6104.48 --> 6107.04
yeah

6105.6 --> 6110.08
i actually

6107.04 --> 6111.92
understand a lot about what's going on

6110.08 --> 6114.08
with the map with the projections with

6111.92 --> 6116.8
the celestials with all of that with

6114.08 --> 6120.719
what could be

6116.8 --> 6122.56
jake dude that guy

6120.719 --> 6125.52
i mean he might

6122.56 --> 6128.88
kind of copy paste some ideas and get

6125.52 --> 6130.8
into don't do it he's a [ __ ]

6128.88 --> 6133.6
psychopath

6130.8 --> 6134.400000000001

6133.6 --> 6136.2390000000005
don't

6134.4 --> 6139.04
follow him

6136.239 --> 6140.32
he will poison your soul

6139.04 --> 6142.56
he does

6140.32 --> 6142.5599999999995
it

6143.04 --> 6145.199
don't

6144.4 --> 6147.199

6147.199 --> 6153.36
he's disgusting

6149.76 --> 6157.4400000000005
don't lean on the psychopath

6153.36 --> 6159.92
for your technical arguments

6157.44 --> 6162.879999999999
he's mostly just copying [ __ ] that's

7399.52 --> 7403.84
hospital and they took chemo and then he

7402.239 --> 7407.159
died

7403.84 --> 7407.159000000001
so yeah

7417.44 --> 7422.598999999999
yeah it was

7418.88 --> 7422.599
like throat cancer

7439.84 --> 7444.159000000001
trying to keep your mom of the chemo oh

7441.599 --> 7446.639
jesus yeah just

7444.159 --> 7449.36
the key mode it's it's bad news it

7446.639 --> 7452.76
literally kills off everything

7449.36 --> 7452.759999999999
it's terrible

7478.96 --> 7483.84
for mustard gas research

7481.84 --> 7487.8
i wouldn't be surprised if that's the

7483.84 --> 7487.8
origins of it yeah

7497.119 --> 7502.159
same recipe

7499.199 --> 7504.799999999999
not entirely sure about that did i do

7502.159 --> 7507.119
know that in chemos there's been like a

7504.8 --> 7509.119000000001
lot of developments and like

7507.119 --> 7511.04
tweaks

7509.119 --> 7514.0
to the component it's not exactly the

7511.04 --> 7517.44
same recipe that's not true

7514.0 --> 7517.44
there's different types of chemo

7517.52 --> 7521.84
but it's pretty much all bad news

7546.159 --> 7549.159
hmm

7567.92 --> 7571.4400000000005
right

7568.96 --> 7574.079
you guys think i overreacted with gadget

7571.44 --> 7574.079
inspector

7574.4 --> 7580.4
it's just that it's been pretty cool to

7577.679 --> 7583.28
have him around and then

7580.4 --> 7585.44
since like a while ago he just

7583.28 --> 7588.48
kept getting on my nerves and saying

7585.44 --> 7590.638999999999
like stupid things

7588.48 --> 7593.04
like he has some impaired judgment or

7590.639 --> 7595.28
something i don't know what the [ __ ] was

7593.04 --> 7595.28
that

7595.52 --> 7600.320000000001
but this was not like i abandoned not

7597.76 --> 7602.2390000000005
just because of it in the spur moment i

7600.32 --> 7604.159
would never do that to somebody that's

7602.239 --> 7606.239
actually been following an intro that

7604.159 --> 7608.159
i've been interacting with

7606.239 --> 7610.079
in chat for a long time it's just that

7608.159 --> 7613.079
it was like getting on my nerves for a

7610.079 --> 7613.079
while

7620.4 --> 7626.199
but yeah in the start he seemed like a

7622.719 --> 7626.199
really cool guy

7640.32 --> 7644.639
50 50 percent

7642.159 --> 7647.36
chance surviving what you're going to

7644.639 --> 7650.719
believe that

7647.36 --> 7651.839999999999
what because a doctor told you that

7650.719 --> 7653.599
really

7651.84 --> 7655.92
no no no i would

7653.599 --> 7657.679
inquire deeper as to how they get into

7655.92 --> 7659.119
that conclusion

7657.679 --> 7661.4400000000005
yeah

7659.119 --> 7663.04
i'm not just going to take

7661.44 --> 7666.0
some stupid

7663.04 --> 7667.44
chance calculation estimate from a

7666.0 --> 7669.28
doctor

7667.44 --> 7672.799999999999
just like that

7669.28 --> 7675.84
oh really 50 50 chances of like what the

7672.8 --> 7675.84
[ __ ] are you talking about

7676.88 --> 7681.04
no

7677.76 --> 7683.360000000001
that's [ __ ] like the entire cancer

7681.04 --> 7685.44
industry rests

7683.36 --> 7688.079
on fear porn

7685.44 --> 7689.44
on doctors scaring the [ __ ] out of you

7688.079 --> 7690.88
oh you're gonna die you're gonna die

7689.44 --> 7694.5599999999995
you're gonna do this

7690.88 --> 7696.719
and like really bad like that

7694.56 --> 7698.8
no

7696.719 --> 7700.8
i'm not afraid of cancer i think i

7698.8 --> 7703.52
probably had cancer

7700.8 --> 7704.400000000001
multiple occasions and it just went away

7703.52 --> 7705.84
again

7704.4 --> 7709.44
because i think

7705.84 --> 7711.84
that cancer is a natural mechanism

7709.44 --> 7714.5599999999995
just like viruses

7711.84 --> 7716.56
it's a part of my body you get born with

7714.56 --> 7718.400000000001
it provably

7716.56 --> 7721.679
you had like 20 different types of

7718.4 --> 7723.04
cancers when you are born it's in you at

7721.679 --> 7725.599
all time

7723.04 --> 7728.96
because it's part of your body

7725.599 --> 7731.84
it's do it's there for a reason

7728.96 --> 7734.32
it does something it has a function

7731.84 --> 7736.32
and yeah if you completely over toxify

7734.32 --> 7738.96
your entire body

7736.32 --> 7741.119
or you are exposed to like absurd levels

7738.96 --> 7742.96
of stress where you go way too far you

7741.119 --> 7744.96
don't learn your lesson you keep getting

7742.96 --> 7746.96
worse and worse yeah you're gonna get

7744.96 --> 7748.96
something really you're gonna get an out

7746.96 --> 7751.599
of control response

7748.96 --> 7754.2390000000005
it's like a police riot

7751.599 --> 7756.96
right because every part of the body is

7754.239 --> 7760.4
like a big society

7756.96 --> 7762.639
viruses are like garbage workers

7760.4 --> 7762.638999999999
right

7762.8 --> 7766.4800000000005
and

7764.239 --> 7768.799999999999
cancer is

7766.48 --> 7770.959999999999
more like a police force

7768.8 --> 7775.119000000001
right it's like oh there's an emergency

7770.96 --> 7777.76
here we gotta corner this off and like

7775.119 --> 7779.839999999999
secure the perimeter and

7777.76 --> 7782.639
and resolve this issue or maybe more

7779.84 --> 7783.52
like firemen

7782.639 --> 7784.88
right

7783.52 --> 7786.96
they're there it's like oh there's a

7784.88 --> 7789.28
danger this is a stress response we got

7786.96 --> 7790.88
to fix this organ

7789.28 --> 7792.5599999999995
and then it's go yeah it's going to get

7790.88 --> 7794.0
painful probably

7792.56 --> 7796.079000000001
cancer is going to do something it's

7794.0 --> 7797.599
going to encapsulate it and then when

7796.079 --> 7801.28
it's fixed

7797.599 --> 7804.159000000001
it gets dissolved it goes away again but

7801.28 --> 7806.239
you have to get to that point

7804.159 --> 7808.239
and yeah if you keep on poisoning

7806.239 --> 7811.28
yourself and agitating cutting into the

7808.239 --> 7812.718999999999
cancer through surgery or attacking it

7811.28 --> 7814.88
through

7812.719 --> 7817.44
radiation therapy or something yeah

7814.88 --> 7819.119
there's also a chance it's gonna go into

7817.44 --> 7821.919999999999
full war

7819.119 --> 7824.4
most of the aggressive

7821.92 --> 7827.04
actions that happen as a result from

7824.4 --> 7829.199
cancer happen after

7827.04 --> 7831.199
intervention

7829.199 --> 7833.839999999999
after it's been cut into and something

7831.199 --> 7836.4
is left or after

7833.84 --> 7839.84
the chemo radiation theory that's when

7836.4 --> 7840.719
it becomes aggressive as they say

7839.84 --> 7842.8
right

7840.719 --> 7844.4
because you're not supposed to do that i

7842.8 --> 7846.56
mean

7844.4 --> 7849.839999999999
i'm not saying that you should never

7846.56 --> 7852.2390000000005
like oh just always let it be no no look

7849.84 --> 7854.56
cancer can literally have give physical

7852.239 --> 7857.44
complications like yeah if it's gonna

7854.56 --> 7859.599
close off an artery for example

7857.44 --> 7862.0
then you have to like

7859.599 --> 7864.0
prevent the closing of that artery if

7862.0 --> 7866.4
you have to then surgically remove a

7864.0 --> 7868.0
part of it or something yeah because

7866.4 --> 7869.04
otherwise how are you going to survive

7868.0 --> 7870.88
right

7869.04 --> 7873.28
but

7870.88 --> 7876.159000000001
only because of that because you should

7873.28 --> 7878.32
just leave it as much as it is and let

7876.159 --> 7880.799999999999
it resolve itself because the more you

7878.32 --> 7883.36
start to intervene the more dangerous it

7880.8 --> 7885.4400000000005
can become

7883.36 --> 7887.04
and this is all very over generalized

7885.44 --> 7889.759999999999
right i am not

7887.04 --> 7891.36
a medical doctor i'm not definitely not

7889.76 --> 7893.119000000001
specialized in

7891.36 --> 7895.598999999999
cancer surgery

7893.119 --> 7897.679
they know from experience a lot more on

7895.599 --> 7899.599
how that works they just follow the

7897.679 --> 7902.0
protocols

7899.599 --> 7902.88
and the insurance company policies and

7902.0 --> 7905.04
all that

7902.88 --> 7906.8
the surgeons right i'm not saying they

7905.04 --> 7910.96
are incompetent

7906.8 --> 7913.360000000001
just saying the program they roll by

7910.96 --> 7915.36
just that's certain protocols

7913.36 --> 7917.5199999999995
right they still get plenty of data and

7915.36 --> 7919.759999999999
plenty of results from what they do with

7917.52 --> 7921.84
it and then they might be able to even

7919.76 --> 7923.360000000001
figure out like yeah all this cancer

7921.84 --> 7925.4400000000005
treatment is actually really

7923.36 --> 7927.119
counterproductive it doesn't really heal

7925.44 --> 7928.159
people but yeah it makes a lot of money

7927.119 --> 7929.28
so

7928.159 --> 7933.199
right

7929.28 --> 7933.199
doctors sometimes are aware of that

7935.04 --> 7941.199
but yeah it's a big issue and there's

7938.0 --> 7942.88
other ways to approach cancer treatment

7941.199 --> 7946.48
like with

7942.88 --> 7949.119
cbd thc therapy

7946.48 --> 7950.718999999999
it works remarkably well there's like

7949.119 --> 7953.44
scientific

7950.719 --> 7956.0
biological proof

7953.44 --> 7959.5199999999995
that there's receptors

7956.0 --> 7962.56
in humans in on a cellular level

7959.52 --> 7964.96
for the components in cannabis

7962.56 --> 7968.0
that under the right circumstances if

7964.96 --> 7970.4
you don't burn it right you have to kind

7968.0 --> 7971.52
of take the oil extract

7970.4 --> 7974.0
it

7971.52 --> 7975.84
literally makes

7974.0 --> 7978.8
cancer cells

7975.84 --> 7981.4400000000005
commit suicide make them basically move

7978.8 --> 7983.4400000000005
to the moment where it deresolutes where

7981.44 --> 7985.36
it's like okay we're done

7983.44 --> 7987.36
and it's gonna dissolve

7985.36 --> 7989.679
that's what it does right

7987.36 --> 7989.679
that's

7989.88 --> 7996.719
universally a thousand times better than

7993.199 --> 7998.32
any others like cancer protocol

7996.719 --> 8000.88
but yeah

7998.32 --> 8002.88
it's not enough profit

8000.88 --> 8004.8
right what they're gonna stop the most

8002.88 --> 8008.32
profitable

8004.8 --> 8010.159000000001
medical industry in world history

8008.32 --> 8012.5599999999995
because there's something that works

8010.159 --> 8015.36
much better and is much cheaper no of

8012.56 --> 8019.1990000000005
course they're not going to do that

8015.36 --> 8019.199
right that's part of the issue

8020.079 --> 8025.599
i'll take cbd over chemo yeah but it's

8022.32 --> 8027.04
not just cbd you have to also do the thc

8025.599 --> 8028.2390000000005
it's very important

8027.04 --> 8031.44
cbd

8028.239 --> 8035.44
is like good for like hormone regulation

8031.44 --> 8037.598999999999
and all that but you also need the thc

8035.44 --> 8039.119
to get the cancer self-destruction

8037.599 --> 8041.84
effect going

8039.119 --> 8044.239
only cbd doesn't do that

8041.84 --> 8047.52
right so i've heard

8044.239 --> 8051.239
from adam who actually works with this

8047.52 --> 8051.2390000000005
he knows a lot more

8054.88 --> 8059.4400000000005
got around cbd right or if it's helping

8056.88 --> 8062.079
it's helping right it it will help

8059.44 --> 8064.239
your body being in a better condition is

8062.079 --> 8066.799999999999
also going to help the cancer but for

8064.239 --> 8069.36
the specific

8066.8 --> 8072.079000000001
cellular self-destruction mechanism for

8069.36 --> 8075.44
cancer cells it also requires to see the

8072.079 --> 8077.28
thc just remember that

8075.44 --> 8079.839999999999
but yeah that also kind of means that

8077.28 --> 8081.759999999999
they might get high from it maybe even

8079.84 --> 8084.719
really high they might find it very

8081.76 --> 8087.4400000000005
uncomfortable some people like really

8084.719 --> 8088.32
really don't like thc eyes

8087.44 --> 8091.199
right

8088.32 --> 8092.639
but unfortunately if you want the cells

8091.199 --> 8094.799999999999
the cancer cells to go into

8092.639 --> 8096.96
self-destruct mode you're going to have

8094.8 --> 8099.04
to go through that right so yeah which

8096.96 --> 8101.199
one do you like you want to get like

8099.04 --> 8102.159
moments where it's like freakishly high

8101.199 --> 8103.119
you're like

8102.159 --> 8106.159
oh

8103.119 --> 8108.48
[ __ ] oh god not again

8106.159 --> 8111.199
or you want to get like chemo

8108.48 --> 8113.119
sickness and lose all your hair and then

8111.199 --> 8115.5199999999995
find out afterward that your immune

8113.119 --> 8118.32
system is completely destroyed or your

8115.52 --> 8119.599
kidneys are all all dead that kind of

8118.32 --> 8122.159
[ __ ] what

8119.599 --> 8126.56
right i'll i'll take the moments of

8122.159 --> 8126.5599999999995
really uncomfortable high thank you

8126.639 --> 8128.96
right

8129.36 --> 8132.92
it's your choice

8139.84 --> 8145.360000000001
ah hey adam

8141.76 --> 8145.360000000001
i was just kind of talking about you

8145.44 --> 8149.96
i hope i said it the right way

8150.96 --> 8155.76
you're much more proficient at the

8152.719 --> 8155.76
details than i am

8156.4 --> 8161.839999999999
but yeah i do care a lot about this

8159.199 --> 8161.839999999999
information

8163.599 --> 8168.2390000000005
high-end you're getting a time out for

8165.52 --> 8168.96
that [ __ ]

8168.239 --> 8170.32
no

8168.96 --> 8171.44
not die

8170.32 --> 8173.44
no

8171.44 --> 8177.199
provable

8173.44 --> 8181.199
provable effect unique

8177.199 --> 8183.04
unique cellular effect

8181.199 --> 8185.36
not high and die

8183.04 --> 8187.199
i'm not talking about smoking a lot of

8185.36 --> 8188.799999999999
doobies or something no i'm talking

8187.199 --> 8190.5599999999995
about

8188.8 --> 8192.559
not smoking not burning it i

8190.56 --> 8194.319
specifically mentioned that

8192.559 --> 8197.599
extracted

8194.319 --> 8197.599
thc cbd

8200.16 --> 8203.519
posted the link from me to yeah yeah

8201.92 --> 8205.04
yeah you did an entire show about it

8203.519 --> 8206.719000000001
didn't you yeah it was a great show

8205.04 --> 8208.160000000002
thank you for posting that

8206.719 --> 8211.678999999998
really helpful

8208.16 --> 8211.679
i hope i got it all right

8212.16 --> 8217.28
i mean i am not a doctor i'm doing this

8214.559 --> 8219.599
out of pure interest and

8217.28 --> 8222.0
because i think it's just an important

8219.599 --> 8224.08
piece of information to have and to

8222.0 --> 8225.519
carry through over generations if

8224.08 --> 8227.599
necessary

8225.519 --> 8229.679
because the medical industry is not

8227.599 --> 8232.559
going to want you to know this

8229.679 --> 8235.04
it never will want you to know this you

8232.559 --> 8238.08
can never expect the medical industry to

8235.04 --> 8241.12
start adopting this at some point unless

8238.08 --> 8243.76
a heavy

8241.12 --> 8245.2
medical revolution happens and like it's

8243.76 --> 8247.679
completely

8245.2 --> 8249.12
overhauled and like all the problems are

8247.679 --> 8251.2
resolved well

8249.12 --> 8253.519
it's kind of bloated with problems right

8251.2 --> 8255.599
now if you know what i mean

8253.519 --> 8258.24
it's kind of hard to

8255.599 --> 8260.08
not know that if you know what i mean

8258.24 --> 8260.84
right so

8260.08 --> 8264.319
right

8260.84 --> 8266.08
now medical industry is going into like

8264.319 --> 8268.88
heavy cancerous

8266.08 --> 8271.76
state you could metaphorically say it's

8268.88 --> 8275.598999999998
it's really seriously corrupt and it's

8271.76 --> 8277.84
getting deadly it's getting dangerous

8275.599 --> 8279.28
there's gonna be

8277.84 --> 8281.439
like yeah

8279.28 --> 8284.639000000001
a whole bunch of people arrested and all

8281.439 --> 8286.719000000001
that and a big reformation of the

8284.639 --> 8288.719
medical system before we can get out of

8286.719 --> 8292.559
this and then maybe

8288.719 --> 8295.438999999998
then maybe cannabis can be

8292.559 --> 8297.438999999998
replacing a lot of cancer therapies

8295.439 --> 8300.559000000001
because it really

8297.439 --> 8300.559000000001
really does work

8300.8 --> 8305.599
but not if you just smoke it that's not

8302.88 --> 8308.16
how it works you got to take it extract

8305.599 --> 8309.04
it you got it like it dissolved in oil

8308.16 --> 8312.639
or

8309.04 --> 8314.559000000001
anyway adamika knows more about his link

8312.639 --> 8315.839999999998
that he posted definitely check it out

8314.559 --> 8317.92
if you want to know more about the

8315.84 --> 8319.92
details

8317.92 --> 8323.28
because yeah adam has actually

8319.92 --> 8323.28
practically worked with this

8323.76 --> 8328.559000000001
he helps people out with it

8325.679 --> 8330.16
so he has a lot of practical experience

8328.559 --> 8331.679
so yeah

8330.16 --> 8334.24
i don't have a lot of practical

8331.679 --> 8337.76
experience unfortunately but i have paid

8334.24 --> 8337.76
attention over my life

8345.679 --> 8352.88
not the time to be in the hospital yeah

8349.599 --> 8355.84
well look typical epilepsia and all that

8352.88 --> 8358.24
it shouldn't be

8355.84 --> 8361.24
rolling into any creepy protocols or

8358.24 --> 8361.24
anything

8361.599 --> 8364.559
and i think there's also like pretty

8363.599 --> 8367.04
good

8364.559 --> 8368.88
substances that they can just like if it

8367.04 --> 8371.519
gets out of hand

8368.88 --> 8373.759999999998
to make the epilepsy stop immediately i

8371.519 --> 8376.24
think

8373.76 --> 8376.24
i don't know

8376.479 --> 8378.88
but i

8380.319 --> 8384.639
i i cannot imagine that it's going to be

8382.719 --> 8387.199999999999
really bad

8384.639 --> 8390.72
i think it was mostly just a shocker i

8387.2 --> 8392.720000000001
myself had like an epilepsia

8390.72 --> 8394.479
as a kid too and everybody was all

8392.72 --> 8396.24
freaked out but when i got out of it it

8394.479 --> 8399.119999999999
was just like oh no i'm just perfectly

8396.24 --> 8402.8
fine i don't even feel like stressed or

8399.12 --> 8405.359
worn out or anything

8402.8 --> 8408.0
and it happened just once so

8405.359 --> 8410.56
and during the winter right that's so

8408.0 --> 8410.56
typical

8411.04 --> 8414.479000000001
like around christmas

8415.28 --> 8419.68
i think like little kids just

8417.439 --> 8420.399
maybe just the tension of it all and

8419.68 --> 8422.319
they

8420.399 --> 8425.599999999999
and then it can typically happen

8422.319 --> 8428.16
something like that so yeah

8425.6 --> 8429.76
i'm not being super worried about clover

8428.16 --> 8431.84
nathan's kid

8429.76 --> 8434.880000000001
i think it's just really a big shocker i

8431.84 --> 8434.880000000001
think it'll be all right

8435.359 --> 8439.359
i mean

8436.64 --> 8442.08
god forbid i'm wrong about that

8439.359 --> 8444.56
but i'm i don't like my senses are

8442.08 --> 8447.84
telling me like

8444.56 --> 8447.84
it shouldn't be that bad

8449.04 --> 8452.560000000001
unless

8450.0 --> 8452.56
there's like

8452.96 --> 8455.039999999999
some

8454.16 --> 8456.64
c

8455.04 --> 8458.399000000001
v

8456.64 --> 8460.08
related issues

8458.399 --> 8462.88
like the issue that you took some kind

8460.08 --> 8465.92
of a vex or something i hope not i don't

8462.88 --> 8465.92
know i can't say

8466.72 --> 8469.519999999999
i don't know

8468.0 --> 8473.2
right but

8469.52 --> 8475.28
you'll probably be hearing about nathan

8473.2 --> 8477.76
we're hearing well

8475.28 --> 8479.439
we'll be hearing nathan about it

8477.76 --> 8483.479
somewhere in the near future he'll

8479.439 --> 8483.479000000001
probably explain it so

8491.359 --> 8494.880000000001
i'll extract some treatments

8498.16 --> 8500.64
all right

8499.2 --> 8502.960000000001
well

8500.64 --> 8508.08
oil extracts

8502.96 --> 8508.08
i don't know exactly what he was using

8512.16 --> 8515.16
right

8515.76 --> 8519.479
but yeah that sucks

8530.16 --> 8534.319
right well yeah i'm sorry to hear that

8532.0 --> 8536.8
jose that had happened to you there's a

8534.319 --> 8539.279999999999
whole bunch of other people

8536.8 --> 8541.199999999999
that do not have that experience it's

8539.28 --> 8545.28
quite the opposite i've known people

8541.2 --> 8547.68
with that quite the opposite yeah

8545.28 --> 8549.52
and that includes my mother

8547.68 --> 8551.6
so

8549.52 --> 8554.0
hey if you don't believe it

8551.6 --> 8557.04
go to the hospital send everybody to the

8554.0 --> 8559.359
hospital keep doing that

8557.04 --> 8561.439
yeah i'm not doing that

8559.359 --> 8562.960000000001
clover seems okay now

8561.439 --> 8565.84
ah awesome

8562.96 --> 8568.16
i knew it i knew it i called it

8565.84 --> 8570.72
i called it

8568.16 --> 8572.479
but i'm glad that it actually did turn

8570.72 --> 8577.16
out all right

8572.479 --> 8577.16
thanks for that information adam

8596.56 --> 8599.56
right

8601.12 --> 8605.76
yeah exactly like the chosen one says it

8603.76 --> 8608.16
does matter like when you start treating

8605.76 --> 8610.399
it because if it's like already in like

8608.16 --> 8612.24
they're really heavy it's already out of

8610.399 --> 8614.16
control you already had surgery this

8612.24 --> 8617.359
that

8614.16 --> 8617.359
it may still help but

8618.0 --> 8626.12
if you start using it when it's still in

8620.24 --> 8626.119999999999
a very early stage it works a lot better

8626.16 --> 8631.92
so i think so at least adam

8630.16 --> 8634.0
anyway i'm not gonna elaborate more if

8631.92 --> 8636.0
you if you want to know the details of

8634.0 --> 8638.08
this then just watch the link that adam

8636.0 --> 8639.52
posted

8638.08 --> 8641.52
the video where

8639.52 --> 8644.0
he is on

8641.52 --> 8646.0
mitchell from australia talking about

8644.0 --> 8648.72
that very subject

8646.0 --> 8650.8
in detail so your interest if you're

8648.72 --> 8652.479
interested watch that link watch it

8650.8 --> 8654.479
really do it

8652.479 --> 8656.0
it's good

8654.479 --> 8658.16
i was watching it when it was live it

8656.0 --> 8660.319
was a really good show

8658.16 --> 8661.439
very informative

8660.319 --> 8663.359
right

8661.439 --> 8664.479000000001
and i think i'm gonna run out now been

8663.359 --> 8669.08
going

8664.479 --> 8669.08
whoa almost two and a half hours

8671.04 --> 8673.84
is that the same

8674.399 --> 8679.319
yeah this

8676.319 --> 8679.319
right

8689.28 --> 8693.439
right well jose look if you're going to

8691.439 --> 8694.880000000001
be anti-cannabis

8693.439 --> 8697.12
treatment

8694.88 --> 8700.08
and you're in the wrong saloon now if

8697.12 --> 8702.240000000002
you don't believe in it or you're like

8700.08 --> 8703.6
no i'm going by my experience and people

8702.24 --> 8705.52
that i know

8703.6 --> 8707.6
it didn't work you're gonna stick to

8705.52 --> 8709.2
that that's fine

8707.6 --> 8713.28
you better not

8709.2 --> 8715.439
get in our [ __ ] way you hear me jose

8713.28 --> 8717.2
if you're gonna be like no no it doesn't

8715.439 --> 8718.24
work it doesn't work don't listen to

8717.2 --> 8722.08
them

8718.24 --> 8725.76
i will freaking kick you out

8722.08 --> 8728.16
right if you choose not to trust it

8725.76 --> 8732.08
because of your experiences that's your

8728.16 --> 8732.08
issue we can't we can't stop you

8732.319 --> 8737.039999999999
you better not

8733.92 --> 8740.399
like so discontent because it does work

8737.04 --> 8740.399000000001
for a whole bunch of people

8740.8 --> 8745.92
and literally the evidence is there

8743.52 --> 8748.880000000001
biologically we have receptors

8745.92 --> 8752.479
specifically specifically

8748.88 --> 8755.119999999999
on a cellular level for these substances

8752.479 --> 8757.438999999998
to do exactly as described

8755.12 --> 8760.0
make the cancer cell sell go

8757.439 --> 8761.52
self-destruct and that's a fact that's a

8760.0 --> 8763.92
medical fact

8761.52 --> 8765.439
if you don't want to trust that that's

8763.92 --> 8767.439
your prerogative

8765.439 --> 8769.52
all right

8767.439 --> 8772.0
okay you're not pro organs okay that's

8769.52 --> 8775.04
that's fine then that's okay that's okay

8772.0 --> 8777.12
just trying to clear things up here

8775.04 --> 8778.399000000001
right

8777.12 --> 8781.52
uh

8778.399 --> 8784.0
i'm gonna run out the show it's been

8781.52 --> 8786.800000000001
a bit intense

8784.0 --> 8790.56
kind of over all over the place

8786.8 --> 8793.039999999999
not seeing gadget inspector back anymore

8790.56 --> 8796.479
because he wouldn't stop whining about

8793.04 --> 8798.080000000002
jake and how supposedly amazing he is

8796.479 --> 8800.16
ugh

8798.08 --> 8803.92
i'm not having that

8800.16 --> 8804.96
right so if you did actually like this

8803.92 --> 8806.88
show

8804.96 --> 8809.119999999999
then please don't forget there rogens it

8806.88 --> 8810.319
up and if you haven't already subscribe

8809.12 --> 8812.319000000001
to my channel and hit the bell

8810.319 --> 8815.119999999999
notification so you know when i'm going

8812.319 --> 8817.359
live which is normally supposed to be 1

8815.12 --> 8819.359
pm amsterdam time in the weekdays

8817.359 --> 8822.08
although recently

8819.359 --> 8823.439
i've been doing more like half past one

8822.08 --> 8824.88
or even

8823.439 --> 8827.76
quarter to two

8824.88 --> 8829.839999999998
but yeah it's the winter and i'm doing

8827.76 --> 8831.359
groceries early

8829.84 --> 8833.76
typically now

8831.359 --> 8836.479000000001
because it does wake me up a bit more

8833.76 --> 8839.28
and i do like that about it so yeah i

8836.479 --> 8841.679999999998
might start typically later than 1 pm

8839.28 --> 8843.68
but i'm supposed to be starting 1 pm

8841.68 --> 8845.439
amsterdam time

8843.68 --> 8847.6
right

8845.439 --> 8851.04
and 2 p.m amsterdam time in the weekend

8847.6 --> 8853.359
and i'm usually on time with that right

8851.04 --> 8854.800000000001
so i will be back tomorrow

8853.359 --> 8856.16
because there's no live flat earth

8854.8 --> 8858.88
debates

8856.16 --> 8862.56
right now i will be back tomorrow with

8858.88 --> 8865.039999999999
flat earth early bird number 1110

8862.56 --> 8868.0
on a friday i think it's already going

8865.04 --> 8870.720000000001
to be christmas day right it's the 24th

8868.0 --> 8873.92
it's the first one

8870.72 --> 8876.0
it's very close one way or the other

8873.92 --> 8879.28
right

8876.0 --> 8881.2
if yeah i don't see you

8879.28 --> 8883.04
this christmas because you're too busy

8881.2 --> 8884.880000000001

happy holidays if you don't like the

8887.2 --> 8892.560000000001
word christmas i do i like it i think

8889.92 --> 8893.84
christmas is awesome

8892.56 --> 8895.519999999999
santa

8893.84 --> 8897.84
not so much but

8895.52 --> 8900.640000000001
yeah what can you do

8897.84 --> 8901.52
but i really do like the festival of the

8900.64 --> 8904.16
light

8901.52 --> 8904.16
and all that

8904.8 --> 8909.599999999999
and just yeah good reminder that the sun

8907.52 --> 8910.960000000001
is gonna come back it's gonna get

8909.6 --> 8913.359
stronger again

8910.96 --> 8915.199999999999
spring will return that's really what

8913.359 --> 8918.880000000001
the festival of light what christmas is

8915.2 --> 8919.68
all about and potentially also the

8918.88 --> 8922.16
yeah

8919.68 --> 8924.0
that tying into jesus christ and how

8922.16 --> 8926.16
that's

8924.0 --> 8928.56
but yeah that's also like jesus christ

8926.16 --> 8929.84
the son so it gets a bit complicated and

8928.56 --> 8930.64
all that

8929.84 --> 8933.76
but

8930.64 --> 8936.399
basically it's the festival of light

8933.76 --> 8940.64
we all shine light to brighten

8936.399 --> 8940.64
our our feelings get together and

8940.8 --> 8943.84
family and

8942.64 --> 8945.599999999999
eat good

8943.84 --> 8949.84
have a good time

8945.6 --> 8952.960000000001
and just enjoy each other's company

8949.84 --> 8954.479
and try not to get in too much family

8952.96 --> 8956.319
hassle

8954.479 --> 8957.519999999999
unfortunately too

8956.319 --> 8959.039999999999
all right that's all part of the

8957.52 --> 8962.479000000001
challenge anyway

8959.04 --> 8965.84
merry christmas and until the next video

8962.479 --> 8997.079
keep it flat

8965.84 --> 8997.079
[Music]

9017.84 --> 9019.92
