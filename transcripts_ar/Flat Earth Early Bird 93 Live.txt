4.13 --> 11.25
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

7.919 --> 16.8
early-bird number 93 I'm your host

11.25 --> 17.66
Arwen and today it's sunny it's really

16.8 --> 22.279
nice

17.66 --> 22.279
cloudy here and there but just sunny

27.23 --> 34.33
son just came from behind the clouds

30.1 --> 34.33
yeah do that

41.82 --> 45.42
yeah it's really nice

48.399 --> 60.379000000000005
so yeah then you'll feel there's been a

52.79 --> 63.47
real Joker here in chat it's good stuff

60.379 --> 69.52
anyway yeah good morning Daniel filled

63.47 --> 69.52
the empty matrix jayjay Steve hmm

73.97 --> 76.6
yeah

77.17 --> 81.64
there's so much happening around its

84.679 --> 90.82900000000001
try to just keep it simple it's not like

87.979 --> 94.96
I got a really complex thing in my head

90.829 --> 99.25899999999999
right now but it's just a lot happening

94.96 --> 102.67899999999999
it's just not letting myself get driven

99.259 --> 106.34
crazy by it and I don't keeping my

102.679 --> 108.819
distance in a way it should know I went

106.34 --> 108.819
deep enough

110.469 --> 119.329
but yeah one thing I am noticing quite

114.799 --> 129.87900000000002
vividly is that I've been been dreaming

119.329 --> 134.12
more and it's weird how it works because

129.879 --> 140.07999999999998
it's almost like it's kind of an almost

134.12 --> 140.08
like dark world dreams but not entirely

143.739 --> 149.26
almost like in-between it's very

146.14 --> 156.33999999999997
interesting and the weird thing is in my

149.26 --> 159.269
dream it's just the theme of being a

156.34 --> 159.269
participant

160.879 --> 168.67999999999998
in the world and actually trying to work

164.9 --> 171.87900000000002
with the the energy connections and the

168.68 --> 176.56900000000002
talents that I have on an ethereal level

171.879 --> 181.849
it's it's interesting I yeah I have no

176.569 --> 189.53
idea it may simply just be my

181.849 --> 192.23
imagination my dreams working on what I

189.53 --> 196.519
had seen because that is what dreams do

192.23 --> 200.13899999999998
dreams are known in general from a lot

196.519 --> 207.37900000000002
of perspectives to resolve things that

200.139 --> 210.799
you can't resolve a normal life feels

207.379 --> 213.26999999999998
like that's happening sort of it's good

210.799 --> 215.88
I guess

213.27 --> 218.43
I do in general feel just a lot better

215.88 --> 225.78
and it's really about what you got on

218.43 --> 231.32
hands there's something to build into to

225.78 --> 231.32
work on then yeah

235.74 --> 244.05
then things start to make sense again to

239.67 --> 247.04999999999998
the feelings it's interesting how that

244.05 --> 249.47
works anyway lots of crazy stuff going

247.05 --> 249.47
on

257.26 --> 260.34
a JMS

261.0 --> 267.21
getting plum spirit oriole like to hear

265.32 --> 272.25
more about where that's coming from

267.21 --> 275.66999999999996
specifically dunno yeah I've been

272.25 --> 281.76
watching a few blocks and few videos of

275.67 --> 284.52000000000004
flat earth Fokker recently and it's

281.76 --> 288.09
interesting because almost in a way it

284.52 --> 288.78
the work we have what he what he talks

288.09 --> 291.41999999999996
about it

288.78 --> 293.57
it feels very familiar it's kind of

291.42 --> 297.32
almost like what I went through myself

293.57 --> 301.84999999999997
with my own responses my own focuses and

297.32 --> 301.84999999999997
yeah it just makes very good points

307.19 --> 311.92
it's really from a much deeper

312.46 --> 318.44
simulation perspective like much much

316.22 --> 322.87
deeper much further varia matrix

318.44 --> 322.87
oriented and I get that concept

332.199 --> 337.029
still what I personally tend to do is

334.96 --> 340.779
not to go off too far in one direction

337.029 --> 344.199
and just keep them all together because

340.779 --> 351.659
they are all seemingly parallel all the

344.199 --> 351.659
approaches hey hello Nathan

362.59 --> 369.48999999999995
right okay a gem that's really

365.5 --> 371.77
interesting but is there any direct

369.49 --> 375.03000000000003
indication of this or are you just

371.77 --> 375.03
sowing fear porn

413.15 --> 422.13
so hey Jim what are you in fear about

417.24 --> 428.64
right now are you saying which should

422.13 --> 432.0
just always be trembling or is there

428.64 --> 435.56
something you feel specifically that

432.0 --> 439.31
should incur our wrath or the his wrath

435.56 --> 439.31
enough specifically

448.72 --> 453.66
good morning [ __ ] juice over McCool

454.08 --> 461.15999999999997
anyway I put the link out there be nice

461.759 --> 472.499
to have a conversation maybe oh that's

467.629 --> 475.159
right yeah yeah I talked about it on my

472.499 --> 479.84900000000005
show and it's just disgusting but true

475.159 --> 481.08
that incurred the wrath off for the

479.849 --> 483.49899999999997
entire world

481.08 --> 483.49899999999997
really

497.639 --> 502.939
ah right go in each low

510.46 --> 516.76
oh right yeah hmm yeah I know I know

513.58 --> 520.659
this is just one step many things that

516.76 --> 523.21
they want to do they want to push

520.659 --> 527.67
farther and further and further into the

523.21 --> 527.6700000000001
madness I know that it's just one step

529.35 --> 535.41
it's kind of weird because you know

531.61 --> 535.41
they're letting it happen

564.83 --> 569.86
right a gem seems to be in an upset mood

576.46 --> 583.8000000000001
you know I get that I have a - you've

579.88 --> 583.8
noticed sometimes

585.36 --> 595.99
yeah I can't say it makes me happy but

588.88 --> 599.92
yeah again it is like still up to the

595.99 --> 602.71
people right allowing it doesn't mean

599.92 --> 608.41
that everybody suddenly mandated to do

602.71 --> 613.38
that or something so it just seems to be

608.41 --> 613.38
a case of blatantly too much freedom

654.52 --> 659.649
yeah this is all getting very deep in

657.73 --> 661.44
chat here and almost don't know what to

659.649 --> 665.26
say you wanna know what to talk about

661.44 --> 670.8900000000001
light-hearted think it's probably not

665.26 --> 670.89
gonna work out never really does yeah

670.98 --> 681.66
yeah I'm still chewy um

677.76 --> 687.399
Saturday's game no wait from what Sunday

681.66 --> 693.49
that new group and it's just like it's

687.399 --> 695.26
probably typically D&D gamer to just be

693.49 --> 697.779
thinking about that yeah I want to do

695.26 --> 701.649
more I want to do more like I for almost

697.779 --> 704.5
I forgot how that was because I haven't

701.649 --> 706.51
played in as a player in another game

704.5 --> 710.62
for such a long time and yeah you get

706.51 --> 712.12
really caught up in it to the point

710.62 --> 717.16
where you have to be careful that it

712.12 --> 722.64
doesn't become an obsession because it

717.16 --> 722.64
is just very fascinating but

723.34 --> 729.6700000000001
yeah also because of these people and

725.71 --> 734.26
I'm just very very curious I feel that

729.67 --> 737.26
these people in their mental and

734.26 --> 740.83
consciousness choices of how to approach

737.26 --> 746.49
and deal with the world is so much from

740.83 --> 746.49
the other side in a way like

750.66 --> 757.98
it's just such they're so different yet

753.899 --> 759.48
very smart and they have a lot of

757.98 --> 763.5
experience with a lot of different

759.48 --> 765.24
people and character traits obviously if

763.5 --> 767.699
you deal with a lot of gamers and they

765.24 --> 770.13
have they like didn't edit for 20 years

767.699 --> 771.66
really intensely so they're even really

770.13 --> 776.54
more fanatical than me anyway although

771.66 --> 781.769
yeah I did write an entire book about it

776.54 --> 785.279
sounds like some crazy nerd but that's

781.769 --> 788.61
just so much I feel I could learn from

785.279 --> 791.269
them even from an entirely different

788.61 --> 791.269
perspective

792.92 --> 798.7199999999999
yeah

795.51 --> 801.53
it makes me glad that I might yeah I may

798.72 --> 801.53
have that opportunity

802.22 --> 808.72
and also learn about just new fields

805.07 --> 814.7800000000001
that I've never really known much about

808.72 --> 819.4100000000001
the whole genetics aspect like they were

814.78 --> 823.79
laboratory scientists with genetics like

819.41 --> 826.4
for real and like a the first response

823.79 --> 830.7199999999999
is like all [ __ ] that's potentially

826.4 --> 833.6
really dark or misled or yeah because

830.72 --> 834.3100000000001
that's the direction that I'm coming

833.6 --> 838.0400000000001
from

834.31 --> 841.6099999999999
but as per people they are still very

838.04 --> 847.25
interesting and they have things that I

841.61 --> 850.4
think I may be able to smoothen out some

847.25 --> 853.43
edges that they can't smooth out while

850.4 --> 856.78
they can hand me dollish that I could by

853.43 --> 856.78
myself never attained

857.76 --> 865.73
so it really feels like an a knowledge

860.339 --> 865.73
win-win scenario for me

869.48 --> 873.3100000000001
and yeah just

874.72 --> 879.21
just dwelling on that and

881.15 --> 885.89
bit about what flavor fokker said

887.54 --> 890.26
it's like

893.03 --> 899.4399999999999
what he's actually trying to describe

895.16 --> 899.4399999999999
are like micro resets

902.079 --> 904.769
it is

907.05 --> 917.88
stems from the concept Mandela effect

911.79 --> 921.76
but yeah what is noticing it's just

917.88 --> 925.899
these micro resets as I will call them

921.76 --> 928.75
seem to be almost a randomly timed and

925.899 --> 933.42
they're not all simultaneously they seem

928.75 --> 933.42
to be like occurring at random moments

933.54 --> 941.019
not all synchronous as it were and then

939.43 --> 946.93
I've been thinking like you know what is

941.019 --> 949.829
that if that presupposing that it acts

946.93 --> 952.529
like it works that that is all will just

949.829 --> 956.88
continue on the conceptualization and

952.529 --> 956.88
makes me think like yeah it's

957.97 --> 965.409
that we our lives and what our

962.47 --> 969.8190000000001
consciousness do with our lives is part

965.409 --> 974.489
of a giant simulation program and the

969.819 --> 979.329
program is being regularly updated and

974.489 --> 982.599
that includes us as the program updates

979.329 --> 985.7489999999999
the entire thing the directions things

982.599 --> 989.9190000000001
are going so do we get opportunity

985.749 --> 993.089
apparently to ourselves change with it

989.919 --> 999.959
or in other direction it's like we get

993.089 --> 1003.0590000000001
the options although yeah we may

999.959 --> 1006.3889999999999
consciously not really experience that

1003.059 --> 1009.01
even because yeah micro resets applied

1006.389 --> 1012.07
to ourselves so there may be

1009.01 --> 1012.0699999999999
[Music]

1013.47 --> 1016.47
natural

1016.709 --> 1023.65
dislocations anyway

1020.66 --> 1023.65
because of

1024.09 --> 1027.02
because of the

1028.549 --> 1035.44
flexible nature of the updating of it

1033.39 --> 1039.0
all

1035.44 --> 1039.0
does that make any damn sense

1043.95 --> 1049.65
probably does but yeah what are you

1046.98 --> 1052.1100000000001
gonna do with it just make things look

1049.65 --> 1055.5900000000001
even more complicated still kind of the

1052.11 --> 1059.85
same it's still thinking like a big

1055.59 --> 1064.11
simulation and then how how do updates

1059.85 --> 1068.1
the deja vu reset thingy as they

1064.11 --> 1071.1299999999999
portrayed it in the movie how how does

1068.1 --> 1074.03
that function in the hole and when you

1071.13 --> 1074.0300000000002
get to experience

1076.53 --> 1085.47
what makes you experience it like our

1079.65 --> 1090.0900000000001
regular people having this like a lot

1085.47 --> 1093.6000000000001
and they don't notice it because they're

1090.09 --> 1094.9499999999998
programmed not to look at it and just go

1093.6 --> 1099.6599999999999
with the update as quick as possible

1094.95 --> 1101.5800000000002
without being disturbed by it could that

1099.66 --> 1103.92
be the reason why some people are

1101.58 --> 1108.6299999999999
noticing it so much especially it

1103.92 --> 1111.1200000000001
truthers and just true there's people

1108.63 --> 1116.73
that try to go with the truth because

1111.12 --> 1121.32
yeah the truth is not go with a lie for

1116.73 --> 1125.04
convenience so that subconsciously

1121.32 --> 1127.56
programmed reaction that people a lot of

1125.04 --> 1130.29
people will have taken on to make things

1127.56 --> 1133.23
easier for them many of us will not have

1130.29 --> 1135.69
that instinct to actually have quite the

1133.23 --> 1138.3
opposite and actually do notice the

1135.69 --> 1141.26
difference a lot but that makes it even

1138.3 --> 1146.75
harder in a sense because there probably

1141.26 --> 1146.75
are so many micro resets going on

1170.92 --> 1178.54
yeah catters I've never talked about it

1175.54 --> 1182.8799999999999
before I kind of made it up in a spot a

1178.54 --> 1182.8799999999999
micro reset a micro research would be

1183.27 --> 1196.99
tiny seemingly random timed changes very

1191.77 --> 1202.9
small ones that are meant to be subtle

1196.99 --> 1205.45
and not radical like a true reset to

1202.9 --> 1211.26
nudge things in a certain direction to

1205.45 --> 1211.26
update the entire program piece by piece

1212.52 --> 1217.42
that's the concept of a micro reset and

1215.5 --> 1223.2
it would be very in line with the

1217.42 --> 1226.3000000000002
Mandela effect experiences so yeah is

1223.2 --> 1229.54
theoretical it is according to you could

1226.3 --> 1232.1499999999999
say the matrix theory I think that by

1229.54 --> 1236.55
now we can call it the simulation or

1232.15 --> 1241.8000000000002
matrix Theory approach of cosmogony

1236.55 --> 1241.8
because yeah I personally don't

1242.1 --> 1252.08
feel good and like ascribing to that

1245.84 --> 1254.82
it's too much it's too much for me I

1252.08 --> 1257.46
need to stay down to earth and that's

1254.82 --> 1261.6599999999999
very hard when you go into that kind of

1257.46 --> 1264.27
approach and I do believe that the world

1261.66 --> 1268.5900000000001
definitely has similar Tori aspects to

1264.27 --> 1276.66
it that are quite confusing surreal but

1268.59 --> 1283.3799999999999
a a true simulation no I think it's

1276.66 --> 1286.95
probably similar Tori but not fake not

1283.38 --> 1289.68
you turn it off and it was just a sub

1286.95 --> 1291.3
reality like thing although yeah that

1289.68 --> 1295.3500000000001
may be a matter of perspective because

1291.3 --> 1301.32
yeah if we are or the mind spawn of the

1295.35 --> 1305.85
creator who is in an over dimension than

1301.32 --> 1308.1499999999999
yet to it it is so it's a matter of

1305.85 --> 1308.1499999999999
perspective

1324.33 --> 1332.54
right yeah f F earth fader you make a

1330.24 --> 1332.54
good point

1335.3 --> 1343.6499999999999
the concept of a big reset of a giant

1338.46 --> 1346.67
disaster of the world ending has always

1343.65 --> 1346.67
been there

1352.62 --> 1359.6689999999999
seduce us to not make an effort because

1357.99 --> 1362.88
it's no use

1359.669 --> 1367.5
because it's gonna end anyway so why

1362.88 --> 1369.5900000000001
would you do it and yeah you can find

1367.5 --> 1374.51
this type of thinking in any culture

1369.59 --> 1374.51
really but

1379.86 --> 1388.4189999999999
it loses the the point of actually going

1384.28 --> 1393.34
through the experience and isn't that in

1388.419 --> 1396.88
a sense why we're here to do all these

1393.34 --> 1399.6689999999999
things to to make that connection

1396.88 --> 1404.95
between our mind and the real world to

1399.669 --> 1408.4
do things with it and to develop it you

1404.95 --> 1412.78
know so yeah to then say no it's no use

1408.4 --> 1415.47
it's just gonna reset yeah it's gonna

1412.78 --> 1415.47
pacify you

1418.18 --> 1421.1100000000001
then again

1425.52 --> 1430.529
there's always something you can do like

1427.89 --> 1437.7
even if you would assume some kind of

1430.529 --> 1441.059
reset you could think of like a a gamble

1437.7 --> 1446.46
in a sense of what what are you going to

1441.059 --> 1449.039
prepare for like what specific type of

1446.46 --> 1451.1100000000001
occurrence or multiple occurrences that

1449.039 --> 1455.549
could potentially happen are you going

1451.11 --> 1459.09
to prepare for giving some kind of minor

1455.549 --> 1462.029
guarantee in order to allow you to just

1459.09 --> 1465.51
do the rest of it basically don't obsess

1462.029 --> 1468.27
and yeah the prepping it's called

1465.51 --> 1471.26
prepping and that's something that I

1468.27 --> 1473.789
think all flat-earthers should engage in

1471.26 --> 1475.32
because yeah it is part of

1473.789 --> 1477.96
self-sufficiency if you have to

1475.32 --> 1484.8899999999999
conscious then you also have the

1477.96 --> 1488.97
responsibility to allow it to exist and

1484.89 --> 1491.76
for that you need self-sufficiency and

1488.97 --> 1494.1490000000001
at first felt self-sufficiency on the

1491.76 --> 1497.0
short run but yeah also

1494.149 --> 1501.7199999999998
self-sufficiently on the long run and

1497.0 --> 1507.02
self-sufficient see through radical

1501.72 --> 1507.02
changes that's that's the last step

1507.22 --> 1514.34
so yeah think about it

1510.47 --> 1518.029
if you're really worried then yeah you

1514.34 --> 1521.35
can drown in the worries or you can

1518.029 --> 1526.58
think of like what can I do

1521.35 --> 1533.269
what are you fearing maybe lost and how

1526.58 --> 1538.549
can you then some how attempt to

1533.269 --> 1541.07
guarantee its continuation because many

1538.549 --> 1544.37
things can happen they may not all

1541.07 --> 1547.37
happen but we all get the feeling that

1544.37 --> 1552.2299999999998
at least things are gonna happen some

1547.37 --> 1557.2589999999998
things definitely would be too weird if

1552.23 --> 1560.59
nothing happened after such intensity of

1557.259 --> 1560.59
information release

1567.98 --> 1570.85
anyway

1576.65 --> 1583.18
what does that mean the last step in

1580.67 --> 1583.18
their way

1586.39 --> 1588.6000000000001
and

1596.83 --> 1601.62
yeah

1598.86 --> 1605.6299999999999
yeah a gym I don't think anything can

1601.62 --> 1605.6299999999999
reset time not even God

1608.95 --> 1620.23
like he can definitely transcend time in

1614.8 --> 1624.55
the design but yeah the design exists

1620.23 --> 1629.53
because a time don't you realize that

1624.55 --> 1631.11
so resetting time it doesn't mean

1629.53 --> 1635.16
anything

1631.11 --> 1635.1599999999999
in the over dimension

1638.95 --> 1646.989
I think if anything it resets Mandela

1644.289 --> 1651.039
induced the military assimilation

1646.989 --> 1656.8890000000001
induced is kind of like adapting the

1651.039 --> 1659.71
design adapting the timings almost like

1656.889 --> 1667.109
yeah what what have been seeing another

1659.71 --> 1667.109
science fiction stuff with like yeah

1667.529 --> 1675.669
time ships that like alter the past and

1672.73 --> 1677.98
[ __ ] and do things that try to change

1675.669 --> 1683.259
the way things develop and everything

1677.98 --> 1685.71
maybe that is exactly what God is and is

1683.259 --> 1691.83
doing up there

1685.71 --> 1696.6290000000001
maybe that is the throne so it can just

1691.83 --> 1696.629
throughout all time decide okay this

1697.15 --> 1700.92
and he has an oversight

1700.97 --> 1705.7
just trying to find the best outcome

1706.8 --> 1711.29
and probably experimenting through it

1715.09 --> 1721.23
but maybe that's just a fantasy of mine

1717.549 --> 1721.23
and a fantasy of some

1721.9 --> 1731.02
other people I don't know maybe it's

1728.08 --> 1733.299
just very literally we're never gonna

1731.02 --> 1736.72
find out because there's no use to

1733.299 --> 1740.549
really finding out but yeah there's

1736.72 --> 1740.549
still a lot more to find out

1746.34 --> 1753.33
yeah Nathan is having a new debate today

1784.48 --> 1792.1
Nathan and me are competing in the

1786.94 --> 1794.739
master beat yet Nathan is asking uh I

1792.1 --> 1797.7099999999998
need a guest somebody wants to join a

1794.739 --> 1804.82
gong life soon and I'm I am life

1797.71 --> 1805.419
enjoying me ice yeah probably not gonna

1804.82 --> 1809.9189999999999
happen

1805.419 --> 1815.159
we'll see ya anyone out here hey if you

1809.919 --> 1815.159
want to join get on over here

1819.87 --> 1826.34
yeah and cat earth yeah you're right

1822.72 --> 1830.13
you're absolutely right

1826.34 --> 1833.8999999999999
occult information occult knowledge true

1830.13 --> 1833.9
insight are true

1836.62 --> 1841.62
inside beyond yeah that

1843.32 --> 1855.1699999999998
it will drive you to your limits it will

1848.17 --> 1860.18
tend to unravel the subtle local

1855.17 --> 1865.01
elements of a person even can do that if

1860.18 --> 1869.93
you allow it if you allow the new

1865.01 --> 1871.85
knowledge to make you discard things to

1869.93 --> 1875.8100000000002
adapt to the new knowledge if you're

1871.85 --> 1878.54
gonna be that serious about it or you

1875.81 --> 1882.62
could just look at it and just try to

1878.54 --> 1886.1599999999999
let it sink in and just see and try to

1882.62 --> 1889.57
be yourself as much as you can so yeah

1886.16 --> 1894.7
be careful with our called stuff and

1889.57 --> 1897.73
that even includes flatter things

1894.7 --> 1902.41
because Flat Earth kind of is are called

1897.73 --> 1902.41
it's hidden that's what that means

1911.45 --> 1914.0800000000002
huh

1915.57 --> 1922.619
all right yeah Vincent roads just posted

1919.739 --> 1925.429
another video five minute video check

1922.619 --> 1925.4289999999999
that out after this

1934.03 --> 1938.31
yeah Peter Berger if you want

1939.05 --> 1942.25
you can join me

1950.1 --> 1954.4499999999998
all right Graham Wilson Brian Wilson

1952.8 --> 1959.84
have I thought about moving to another

1954.45 --> 1959.8400000000001
country well yeah but

1961.54 --> 1968.35
I need to be very careful before I

1964.3 --> 1976.44
consider such a thing cause I'm not

1968.35 --> 1982.3899999999999
fully aware of the complete of the

1976.44 --> 1984.79
countries what are they gonna do and the

1982.39 --> 1991.0300000000002
Netherlands for some mysterious reason

1984.79 --> 1994.96
has always felt a very safe as a place

1991.03 --> 1998.41
to sit through the storm as I described

1994.96 --> 2000.6200000000001
it and I'm not even sure if that is the

1998.41 --> 2000.6200000000001
case

2002.97 --> 2008.059
maybe it is maybe it's a matter of

2005.639 --> 2008.059
perspective

2016.31 --> 2023.26
but yeah there's other countries that I

2019.18 --> 2029.27
considered like that are really alluring

2023.26 --> 2029.78
really interesting and nice big can you

2029.27 --> 2035.54
hear me

2029.78 --> 2038.41
hey whoa check check

2035.54 --> 2042.86
yeah here we hear you I can hear hey

2038.41 --> 2045.3500000000001
Jonathan right my uh mic is kind of

2042.86 --> 2051.56
acting up I'm might I might reboot my

2045.35 --> 2060.0499999999997
machine Oh beep yes yeah you're breaking

2051.56 --> 2061.73
up a little but yeah let me uh let me

2060.05 --> 2064.8500000000004
let me reboot my machine give me a

2061.73 --> 2067.28
couple all right no problem may thanks

2064.85 --> 2069.71
for joining man that's cool yeah man

2067.28 --> 2075.71
I've been I want to join with you guys

2069.71 --> 2077.48
for just hey might as well just reset

2075.71 --> 2081.169
because we're missing half of what

2077.48 --> 2083.54
you're saying all right

2081.169 --> 2088.0699999999997
hey I see you soon okay I'll be back all

2083.54 --> 2091.06
right okay cool huh he actually took my

2088.07 --> 2094.06
invite that's nice didn't expect that

2091.06 --> 2094.06
cool

2111.5 --> 2125.75
okay well I got a guest awesome yeah

2118.94 --> 2129.01
wonder what he wants to talk about some

2125.75 --> 2129.01
project they're working on

2179.95 --> 2186.5299999999997
right

2181.46 --> 2191.78
are we resets mudflats fe it's all

2186.53 --> 2196.01
rubbish all right so I take it you're

2191.78 --> 2198.5600000000004
going for the much simpler easy to

2196.01 --> 2200.69
imagine and widely distributed concept

2198.56 --> 2208.66
of the spinning ball in outer space

2200.69 --> 2208.66
universe F earth fader

2225.46 --> 2239.02
yeah although in a way yeah resets and

2232.4 --> 2239.02
mud floods I think that

2239.109 --> 2248.5589999999997
them as concepts are entering our

2243.759 --> 2254.459
mindset our mind a frame of mind now but

2248.559 --> 2256.9300000000003
yeah I want to give you a lead of

2254.459 --> 2262.239
oversimplification and I look I've been

2256.93 --> 2266.3489999999997
warning about this many times with all

2262.239 --> 2268.989
kinds of subjects that is that when you

2266.349 --> 2271.2090000000003
get something new you oversimplify it it

2268.989 --> 2274.65
is actually kind of a childish response

2271.209 --> 2277.5989999999997
it's not bad it's just what a child does

2274.65 --> 2280.809
you give them some kind of new toy and

2277.599 --> 2284.739
suddenly that toy becomes the world to

2280.809 --> 2289.869
them and they fully envelop in that toy

2284.739 --> 2293.41
and yeah that's what happens to us too

2289.869 --> 2299.5190000000002
when new concepts come to our attention

2293.41 --> 2301.719
and our delved into so don't be wary of

2299.519 --> 2304.1499999999996
oversimplification because I think that

2301.719 --> 2306.88
there is something to the mud flood

2304.15 --> 2315.73
concept but I'm not a hundred percent

2306.88 --> 2322.06
sure it is all a unified thing maybe but

2315.73 --> 2326.079
I haven't seen any definitive proof that

2322.06 --> 2331.3289999999997
it is exactly that and it's a fully

2326.079 --> 2338.02
synchronized single singular event so

2331.329 --> 2341.02
maybe it's rather just a anything that

2338.02 --> 2346.21
is also present in this world that

2341.02 --> 2350.32
happens for reasons and it hasn't come

2346.21 --> 2353.56
to our attention before so there's more

2350.32 --> 2356.52
to look into this what is actually going

2353.56 --> 2356.52
on what happened

2367.87 --> 2375.7799999999997
and yeah how does it work how does

2372.43 --> 2375.7799999999997
history work

2391.589 --> 2397.459
get this weird feeling and keep on

2394.469 --> 2397.459
saying it's that

2400.94 --> 2411.46
there's this weird thing I think I

2403.37 --> 2417.2599999999998
suspect I suspect don't know that if

2411.46 --> 2419.45
humans don't contain themselves to a

2417.26 --> 2424.19
certain level and they just go with

2419.45 --> 2430.06
their with their hunger for whatever it

2424.19 --> 2432.94
is fully and they allow radical

2430.06 --> 2439.88
transformation on a very short time span

2432.94 --> 2445.25
that that has a counter response in a

2439.88 --> 2448.7000000000003
way you could say from nature say

2445.25 --> 2450.859
from God or you could say from the dark

2448.7 --> 2454.6699999999996
side it's all a matter of perspective

2450.859 --> 2456.77
maybe it just seems like there's a

2454.67 --> 2459.8
counterbalance again with the light in

2456.77 --> 2464.45
the dark and very ethereal again

2459.8 --> 2468.5600000000004
and some of the pictures martin ithaca

2464.45 --> 2472.0699999999997
showed the other day about entire cities

2468.56 --> 2475.34
that were just wiped away it just seemed

2472.07 --> 2480.619
like wow that was so incredibly

2475.34 --> 2485.1400000000003
beautiful they really they really just

2480.619 --> 2490.76
build everything for they they totally

2485.14 --> 2496.3399999999997
metropolis you know and yeah what was

2490.76 --> 2499.9300000000003
there before that because don't hear any

2496.34 --> 2503.2400000000002
talk about that wasn't that all forests

2499.93 --> 2509.1189999999997
that did just wipe it all away and just

2503.24 --> 2514.339
start building a giant city on it and is

2509.119 --> 2517.339
that the reason why why a disaster then

2514.339 --> 2519.56
happens or is it another way is there

2517.339 --> 2525.44
always these weird types of disasters

2519.56 --> 2528.92
happening in certain regions and people

2525.44 --> 2534.4700000000003
that know it just take the risk just say

2528.92 --> 2536.63
like yeah in this region things tend to

2534.47 --> 2541.3689999999997
get destroyed by certain natural

2536.63 --> 2543.8
violence or phenomena but yeah because

2541.369 --> 2546.3900000000003
of that you're allowed to go there and

2543.8 --> 2550.8300000000004
then be as wild as you can

2546.39 --> 2554.04
basically while regions where it doesn't

2550.83 --> 2557.88
happen and everything is much more

2554.04 --> 2561.21
strict and contained things stay

2557.88 --> 2564.54
regularly the same is there a pattern

2561.21 --> 2567.08
here ah margles taking really long to

2564.54 --> 2567.08
restarting

2586.279 --> 2590.419
alright it just

2594.87 --> 2598.25
it's weird it's like

2600.369 --> 2605.859
sometimes maybe it is because of what I

2603.309 --> 2607.599
do and this is just like a reflection

2605.859 --> 2610.719
because I can't see it any other way

2607.599 --> 2615.009
because I am a game master in a world

2610.719 --> 2617.829
designer and a story designer a creator

2615.009 --> 2622.989
of purpose within the story and glory

2617.829 --> 2626.739
and tragedy and everything that I'm just

2622.989 --> 2629.89
seeing like how is this world unfolding

2626.739 --> 2635.2
how are these things happening what are

2629.89 --> 2639.94
the settings as in how does it work the

2635.2 --> 2643.18
interaction these cycles of time the

2639.94 --> 2647.589
freedoms and the consequences and I'm

2643.18 --> 2657.1299999999997
just thinking like yeah the designer is

2647.589 --> 2662.5789999999997
one hell of a game master if it is the

2657.13 --> 2662.579
way I think it is that's ingenious

2663.24 --> 2671.91
it makes really good stories and it

2667.29 --> 2678.869
gives everyone an opportunity to be you

2671.91 --> 2685.49
know in a way as they are again glory of

2678.869 --> 2685.4900000000002
the designer it's just amazing what

2688.98 --> 2700.56
Marga went on on Nathan's really hey

2696.6 --> 2705.12
hello peanuts Clark hey I'm not a

2700.56 --> 2707.61
special girl but no well maybe he came

2705.12 --> 2710.0099999999998
on mined by accident and he was just too

2707.61 --> 2714.69
embarrassed to say it cuz I am NOT a

2710.01 --> 2719.55
high-profile guy or something I don't

2714.69 --> 2724.08
know okay always he you think he thought

2719.55 --> 2732.42
it was a happy debate yeah oh my god

2724.08 --> 2735.14
yeah it's all right Oliver still got 60

2732.42 --> 2735.14
people watching

2738.85 --> 2752.83
and you got four foot nine jazz a condo

2744.1 --> 2755.2599999999998
and the chat supporting you what oh I

2752.83 --> 2759.73
remember talking about janitor condo

2755.26 --> 2765.9100000000003
oh yeah he's just another he's four foot

2759.73 --> 2774.7
nine yeah four foot nine what is he a

2765.91 --> 2778.47
thumb - mm-hmm um like Joe Rogan I'm

2774.7 --> 2778.47
supposed to be also extremely small

2782.9 --> 2789.62
how you been man me I'm doing great

2786.41 --> 2791.99
actually I feel like I've completely

2789.62 --> 2802.06
recovered although I'm still like having

2791.99 --> 2804.9799999999996
echos of having seen in the deep I'm I'm

2802.06 --> 2806.81
this is all so freakin ethereal but it's

2804.98 --> 2810.32
like staring in a deep for so long makes

2806.81 --> 2813.89
you very vulnerable but now yeah I'm

2810.32 --> 2818.6800000000003
just using the mechanisms the patterns

2813.89 --> 2821.7799999999997
that I saw to no longer look in the deep

2818.68 --> 2824.21
but to remember having looked in the

2821.78 --> 2826.8500000000004
deep it's very fascinating how that

2824.21 --> 2831.14
works it's kind of similar to my vision

2826.85 --> 2833.48
[ __ ] which all happens ages ago but so

2831.14 --> 2835.85
much I've worked on them just from the

2833.48 --> 2838.37
memory of them so now I work on the

2835.85 --> 2841.88
memory of looking in deep without

2838.37 --> 2845.27
actually getting strangled by look

2841.88 --> 2848.36
looking in the deep just did for a while

2845.27 --> 2854.75
and I'm getting out and I still have a

2848.36 --> 2857.32
lot of insight from it so yeah it's good

2854.75 --> 2859.73
I feel good I feel much stronger I've

2857.32 --> 2864.38
interesting things to look forward to I

2859.73 --> 2870.01
have definitely hope that that there are

2864.38 --> 2870.01
so much more that's gonna come about and

2870.42 --> 2878.17
still there this is the weirdest thing

2874.48 --> 2881.08
is that I have so many vision related

2878.17 --> 2883.48
memories of things where I could

2881.08 --> 2888.13
definitely identify myself as being

2883.48 --> 2893.62
myself doing things in the time we're

2888.13 --> 2896.35
just a lot has happened so unless

2893.62 --> 2898.06
there's gonna go insane amounts of thing

2896.35 --> 2900.2799999999997
happening in a very short run which

2898.06 --> 2902.5
would feel very radical and not like

2900.28 --> 2906.6400000000003
this because it felt through the visions

2902.5 --> 2909.75
like they were relatively linear changes

2906.64 --> 2913.0899999999997
so it could be taken could be grown over

2909.75 --> 2917.16
and I've just seen that there is so much

2913.09 --> 2917.1600000000003
more out there that

2920.869 --> 2930.38
like the dark ones can't fabricate

2926.289 --> 2932.9
illusions to that level they're much

2930.38 --> 2935.7490000000003
more direct so I am pretty sure that

2932.9 --> 2939.2000000000003
things are gonna continue on for a while

2935.749 --> 2944.45
in that sense I am dispelling a lot of

2939.2 --> 2946.749
doom that I was actually getting caught

2944.45 --> 2953.1499999999996
up in while looking into the deep

2946.749 --> 2958.0989999999997
because it's getting so close their hope

2953.15 --> 2968.7490000000003
this makes no sense to you I'm trying to

2958.099 --> 2971.9300000000003
and I just will close but yeah there's

2968.749 --> 2976.8489999999997
much more coming in I also feel like

2971.93 --> 2979.8489999999997
there's been like a release on me like

2976.849 --> 2984.619
yeah I'm I'm actually like I'm looking

2979.849 --> 2989.599
upward like I'm actually allowed to do

2984.619 --> 2991.789
what I'm good at besides just this I can

2989.599 --> 2995.4100000000003
actually expand get the rest of my

2991.789 --> 3001.059
skills out I'm not supposed to

2995.41 --> 3003.239
extinguish basically it's just a

3001.059 --> 3003.239
surprise

3004.41 --> 3011.67
gotcha

3006.45 --> 3015.02
what well I'm glad you're doing good man

3011.67 --> 3019.44
I'm glad I'm glad you you were able to

3015.02 --> 3024.48
talk positive you know all right well so

3019.44 --> 3028.29
am I let me tell you yes it's great to

3024.48 --> 3031.049
feel good it's great like a regular

3028.29 --> 3034.95
person I guess could feel fine you know

3031.049 --> 3041.39
but yeah when you went through [ __ ] as

3034.95 --> 3046.819
painful as I did it feels really good to

3041.39 --> 3046.819
feel normal to feel okay

3052.319 --> 3061.989
and it's it can be hard to it can be

3060.159 --> 3065.199
hard to stay positive to you know

3061.989 --> 3068.229
because it's just a lot of dumb people

3065.199 --> 3069.599
man and it's just it can be really

3068.229 --> 3078.759
frustrating

3069.599 --> 3083.739
yeah and you know it aside I just keep

3078.759 --> 3085.479
getting the urge to like like do

3083.739 --> 3088.179
something and I'm trying to find my

3085.479 --> 3092.499
place in all this and I don't know what

3088.179 --> 3095.799
is it you want to do and just know that

3092.499 --> 3100.419
there are people bliss enough not to get

3095.799 --> 3104.069
any of it considered it from that

3100.419 --> 3104.069
perspective I do a lot

3109.26 --> 3112.7990000000004
I really don't know how to put it in

3110.94 --> 3117.089
words I just like I said I'll just keep

3112.799 --> 3119.369
I just I have I have really really weird

3117.089 --> 3127.23
dreams I don't even want to talk about

3119.369 --> 3128.819
em and I don't know are you sure you I

3127.23 --> 3130.77
just don't know what to I don't know and

3128.819 --> 3133.349
I don't know what to do with all this

3130.77 --> 3138.03
what is the sensation you are feeling

3133.349 --> 3141.079
that is feeling like an obstruction can

3138.03 --> 3141.079
you describe that at least

3145.01 --> 3152.63
is it a sense of isolation a sense of

3147.68 --> 3156.109
stagnation like I told you last time

3152.63 --> 3159.9700000000003
there's still like I feel like I have to

3156.109 --> 3166.2799999999997
participate in this system that is just

3159.97 --> 3169.31
we not meant not not meant to benefit me

3166.28 --> 3175.9700000000003
or anybody around me as a whole which

3169.31 --> 3177.59
which system well this I guess it's it's

3175.97 --> 3178.7599999999998
gonna be different coming from you

3177.59 --> 3182.869
because you're in a different country

3178.76 --> 3186.2900000000004
but that's why I'm asking which system

3182.869 --> 3190.67
yeah I mean well in the country that I

3186.29 --> 3194.42
love him you know we you really can't do

3190.67 --> 3198.8
anything unless you have money or you

3194.42 --> 3207.05
know somebody or you're a bad person you

3198.8 --> 3214.96
know and I try I try to be that I try to

3207.05 --> 3217.4900000000002
be that positive person that you know a

3214.96 --> 3220.64
positive person enough to where other

3217.49 --> 3225.2599999999998
people around me can feel it and it

3220.64 --> 3227.0
makes their day better you know and I'm

3225.26 --> 3229.6090000000004
just realizing just a lot of people just

3227.0 --> 3231.71
don't give a [ __ ] they don't I don't

3229.609 --> 3235.22
know if that's because of their

3231.71 --> 3240.35
programming course because of they

3235.22 --> 3243.56
really just don't care well maybe they

3240.35 --> 3247.0
don't care is actually a mask for they

3243.56 --> 3247.0
don't know how to deal with it

3247.43 --> 3252.529
because it doesn't fit their probe got

3250.069 --> 3258.95
their program there why are they want to

3252.529 --> 3264.559
go maybe I don't care it's just the

3258.95 --> 3266.8999999999996
shield just a lot of this stuff that

3264.559 --> 3271.0690000000004
happened over this weekend with

3266.9 --> 3272.39
everybody like fighting everybody it

3271.069 --> 3278.599
just kind of it just kind of showed me

3272.39 --> 3280.67
that you know it's we we can't get our

3278.599 --> 3282.1400000000003
[ __ ] together you know like knew who was

3280.67 --> 3282.7690000000002
fine now I'm not saying that it never

3282.14 --> 3286.1299999999997
would

3282.769 --> 3287.839
it was fighting what happened did you

3286.13 --> 3288.4100000000003
not did you not watch do you marvels

3287.839 --> 3291.369
Channel

3288.41 --> 3294.769
no the other day no I never watched you

3291.369 --> 3297.38
got a catch out there are you kidding me

3294.769 --> 3300.41
I watched these days like eight freakin

3297.38 --> 3303.289
hours of live streams live streams every

3300.41 --> 3307.609
day I'd just die and only because I

3303.289 --> 3309.259
can't look away because so many people

3307.609 --> 3314.42
are going through such interesting

3309.259 --> 3319.549
processes but I can't watch him on what

3314.42 --> 3321.64
tell me what happened summarize it if

3319.549 --> 3325.7
you will

3321.64 --> 3329.569
well I mean you know last last so no not

3325.7 --> 3332.8999999999996
yesterday but the last Sunday globe

3329.569 --> 3335.96
Busters did us did a little show on what

3332.9 --> 3340.9
was right and so obviously that

3335.96 --> 3343.9990000000003
triggered some people on what's one B&V

3340.9 --> 3349.099
globe blushers did a show last Sunday

3343.999 --> 3353.6299999999997
yeah okay

3349.099 --> 3356.96
and I I remember at the beginning of the

3353.63 --> 3358.849
show Bob made it very clear we're not

3356.96 --> 3360.71
saying this is true all we're doing is

3358.849 --> 3364.9700000000003
just looking at this evidence that's all

3360.71 --> 3368.7490000000003
we're doing well some people got

3364.97 --> 3370.5789999999997
triggered by that obviously one of them

3368.749 --> 3373.9399999999996
being on the vegan warrior I'll never

3370.579 --> 3377.029
die he is I know yes I've been on thank

3373.94 --> 3379.579
God okay okay okay or at least you know

3377.029 --> 3383.45
that he doesn't like so uh

3379.579 --> 3388.44
right right

3383.45 --> 3391.41
and this this really affected me because

3388.44 --> 3395.039
I listened to her Viva Warner and of

3391.41 --> 3398.7889999999998
course when he acted like that I it

3395.039 --> 3403.0490000000004
pissed me off you know and so basically

3398.789 --> 3406.829
to make a long story short vegan warrior

3403.049 --> 3408.96
went off on uninvolved on the Marvel

3406.829 --> 3411.509
show and you know how to be Marvel is

3408.96 --> 3414.45
the Marvel is not like any drama on his

3411.509 --> 3417.329
channel if you noticed you'll never hear

3414.45 --> 3419.64
d-model cuz he's just it's just he's

3417.329 --> 3421.9100000000003
just that's the way he likes to do

3419.64 --> 3421.91
things

3422.18 --> 3426.989
so obviously the video is so bad that do

3425.249 --> 3429.2099999999996
you Marvel had to take it off but of

3426.989 --> 3431.369
course you know people people record it

3429.21 --> 3432.7690000000002
yeah you can still the white office only

3431.369 --> 3435.359
gonna make things worse

3432.769 --> 3436.2
right it's kind of drama that's what I

3435.359 --> 3438.8089999999997
told you tomorrow

3436.2 --> 3443.1189999999997
I said demora mobs will just leave it up

3438.809 --> 3443.119
because that's a Barbra Streisand effect

3443.749 --> 3452.519
it's there it's there can't so so our

3449.339 --> 3456.96
long would be hiding it's like loading

3452.519 --> 3459.2589999999996
spotlight on it along with that you know

3456.96 --> 3464.64
on youtube-land

3459.259 --> 3466.349
here in my actual personal life me and

3464.64 --> 3469.109
my girl were trying to find a new place

3466.349 --> 3472.6090000000004
to live and then of course me and her

3469.109 --> 3475.68
got in a big fight this weekend so

3472.609 --> 3478.529
that's maybe that's why my spirits are

3475.68 --> 3483.66
down this this Monday morning you know

3478.529 --> 3486.289
so it was rough weekend and you couldn't

3483.66 --> 3491.009
get away from the fighting basically

3486.289 --> 3496.44
yeah that's what it sounds like so you

3491.009 --> 3500.13
must be it's it's it's just kind of it

3496.44 --> 3506.609
just made me feel like you know what do

3500.13 --> 3508.619
we do you know why can't why can't the

3506.609 --> 3511.9
Christians and hawing Christians the

3508.619 --> 3516.039
clovers why can't we come together

3511.9 --> 3520.7490000000003
and let's do something to just show this

3516.039 --> 3523.98
to the world you know I don't know what

3520.749 --> 3528.069
that's why you'll you know well I mean

3523.98 --> 3530.109
if we if we did three teams and we went

3528.069 --> 3533.89
three different directions on the 60th

3530.109 --> 3536.2889999999998
parallel and if to the two of the boats

3533.89 --> 3546.549
don't meet each other and we got a

3536.289 --> 3549.279
problem or or instead of instead of you

3546.549 --> 3554.349
know giving Robert Davidson $60,000 for

3549.279 --> 3556.69
her for a convention to where we talk

3554.349 --> 3559.3900000000003
about how good we are on YouTube you

3556.69 --> 3563.14
know let's let's do an exploration let's

3559.39 --> 3564.8799999999997
let's get a team of somebody and let's

3563.14 --> 3567.64
let's get them and just start going

3564.88 --> 3570.1800000000003
south and just filming and just show

3567.64 --> 3573.22
what happens when we try to go south

3570.18 --> 3575.6189999999997
even if we get stopped even if we get

3573.22 --> 3578.259
stopped but it lead us to show the world

3575.619 --> 3587.069
that but I think there's already been

3578.259 --> 3587.069
people that did that in the last decades

3588.63 --> 3594.51
there's not that we shouldn't try again

3591.93 --> 3596.37
or something or get a better angle maybe

3594.51 --> 3600.6600000000003
like try the live streaming or whatever

3596.37 --> 3603.81
but I do remember that there has been at

3600.66 --> 3607.7
least two people that have tried that

3603.81 --> 3610.7
and were stopped and even made the news

3607.7 --> 3610.7
so

3614.29 --> 3620.44
but yeah I do get your frustration like

3617.38 --> 3624.4500000000003
progress what progress we want this we

3620.44 --> 3628.2400000000002
want the conclusion all this theorizing

3624.45 --> 3630.64
want the conclusion yeah that's that's

3628.24 --> 3634.41
gonna be the most difficult part of all

3630.64 --> 3637.39
then that's the whole point that's I

3634.41 --> 3640.06
think that is why they do allow us to

3637.39 --> 3643.42
just freely talk about it to make it a

3640.06 --> 3645.67
subject to talk about and not let us get

3643.42 --> 3648.4900000000002
to the end result because then much of

3645.67 --> 3652.2400000000002
the speculation will stop and suddenly

3648.49 --> 3656.3999999999996
much hidden knowledge will be revealed

3652.24 --> 3658.6899999999996
that that will compromise their control

3656.4 --> 3664.63
so that's gonna be the most difficult

3658.69 --> 3668.59
part and yeah I've already carefully

3664.63 --> 3671.62
tried to tell people maybe sorry to say

3668.59 --> 3675.4500000000003
that we may never get this chance ever

3671.62 --> 3681.3599999999997
no matter what we do because it's just

3675.45 --> 3681.3599999999997
not gonna happen but I may be wrong I

3684.25 --> 3690.55
but think about it like why would we get

3687.099 --> 3695.619
so much freedom in even talking about

3690.55 --> 3700.38
flares and all these things if it if it

3695.619 --> 3703.9900000000002
meant there was a serious risk basically

3700.38 --> 3707.38
because I think it is being released in

3703.99 --> 3711.6699999999996
a way that it can stay somewhat

3707.38 --> 3714.55
contained and I don't know I don't know

3711.67 --> 3716.349
you know maybe if indeed some people are

3714.55 --> 3719.17
like yes screw this I'm gonna go there

3716.349 --> 3723.19
now I got a freaking boats and I got

3719.17 --> 3732.48
people and I'm gonna do it and then they

3723.19 --> 3736.869
will find out a hello Chris Barry Lou

3732.48 --> 3739.53
thanks for joining the panel you hear me

3736.869 --> 3739.53
yep

3742.43 --> 3752.089
I guess I guess in a way I kind of

3746.539 --> 3758.0
understand vegan warriors point because

3752.089 --> 3763.549
honestly how how does mudfoot help us

3758.0 --> 3766.819
now how does that help us now it helps

3763.549 --> 3769.609
us to show that the controllers have

3766.819 --> 3773.089
much more power than is generally

3769.609 --> 3779.5099999999998
believed it actually makes things more

3773.089 --> 3781.52
scary that's the tension that's what it

3779.51 --> 3783.98
practically does first you're amazed and

3781.52 --> 3788.48
then you're like what we have what the

3783.98 --> 3792.289
fun that changes almost everything that

3788.48 --> 3796.579
means there's this deep layer secret

3792.289 --> 3800.2400000000002
knowledge technology and this is like a

3796.579 --> 3803.2400000000002
manifestation of it it's showing a sign

3800.24 --> 3806.72
of what they got might just be a

3803.24 --> 3812.72
fragment so yeah it does actually

3806.72 --> 3816.0789999999997
heightened fear well the way I see it is

3812.72 --> 3818.39
there's just there's nothing that I

3816.079 --> 3822.069
could do about what has happened in the

3818.39 --> 3825.92
past there's nothing I can do about it

3822.069 --> 3829.7599999999998
well the only thing I can do is going

3825.92 --> 3832.309
forward all right and I don't I don't

3829.76 --> 3834.0200000000004
see much that's going forward I'm sorry

3832.309 --> 3836.059
I'm just I'm one of those people who are

3834.02 --> 3838.97
like okay you could talking about your

3836.059 --> 3842.599
mouth look but I'm I'm ready to let's

3838.97 --> 3845.3289999999997
let's talk about it right now like it it

3842.599 --> 3850.6400000000003
does kind of seem like a distraction it

3845.329 --> 3853.01
does what's the what's it all right by

3850.64 --> 3855.65
the way before you guys continue thank

3853.01 --> 3858.71
you only sheeple can see for your super

3855.65 --> 3859.42
chat donation just thank thanks for

3858.71 --> 3862.66
everything or

3859.42 --> 3865.329
our wigeon really you help me get

3862.66 --> 3871.2889999999998
through my trip my god bless you yeah

3865.329 --> 3871.289
and you too thanks for that continue

3871.71 --> 3878.71
what's this mud floor I keep hearing

3873.849 --> 3882.819
about so I can summarize it for you the

3878.71 --> 3886.829
mud flood is a concept of a certain

3882.819 --> 3895.779
event that happened in the time period

3886.829 --> 3899.049
if it was you post-renaissance pre yet

3895.779 --> 3901.599
well the it basically is an alternative

3899.049 --> 3903.569
history as to what happened where there

3901.599 --> 3910.96
appeared to be a culmination of

3903.569 --> 3915.329
civilization peak of a well a pre or

3910.96 --> 3919.45
halfway industrialized Western world and

3915.329 --> 3923.44
then yeah disasters happened all over

3919.45 --> 3928.269
the place and including mud floods that

3923.44 --> 3931.119
was before it's just what the mud flood

3928.269 --> 3933.25
the general terminology is about is that

3931.119 --> 3935.46
just the history is just completely

3933.25 --> 3938.14
different from what we're being told and

3935.46 --> 3940.39
the technological progress and

3938.14 --> 3945.3689999999997
development are just not the way they

3940.39 --> 3948.3289999999997
said it was at all and empires have

3945.369 --> 3953.65
risen with their own peak technology

3948.329 --> 3956.44
many times before and that completely

3953.65 --> 3959.23
dispels that our civilization currently

3956.44 --> 3961.75
is so incredibly an advanced because

3959.23 --> 3965.2
yeah there were peak civilizations

3961.75 --> 3968.41
centuries ago that were incredibly

3965.2 --> 3970.97
developed and much more sensible even in

3968.41 --> 3973.3999999999996
so but we have what the mother thought

3970.97 --> 3977.089
mostly points at is the concept that

3973.4 --> 3980.329
there was an event potentially man

3977.089 --> 3982.7599999999998
created events but could also be natural

3980.329 --> 3988.059
it's not entirely clear different

3982.76 --> 3990.1400000000003
approaches to this where yeah through

3988.059 --> 3994.579
electromagnetism or through sound

3990.14 --> 3997.069
through some kind of ancient tech maybe

3994.579 --> 3999.7400000000002
Tesla related maybe Sonic's related

3997.069 --> 4003.16
something something that is outside of

3999.74 --> 4011.8289999999997
the normal field of regular modern day

4003.16 --> 4015.2799999999997
sciences that caused yeah sand and dirt

4011.829 --> 4020.92
and maybe even rocketed disintegrate and

4015.28 --> 4023.9500000000003
liquefy into mud and yeah and there are

4020.92 --> 4026.77
remnants of this kind of event happening

4023.95 --> 4029.23
at least all throughout Europe I suspect

4026.77 --> 4033.549
that the Netherlands was like a key part

4029.23 --> 4036.19
in it it was river mound and yeah if a

4033.549 --> 4039.779
mud flood happens it will it will move

4036.19 --> 4044.859
as long as it is liquid downhill so

4039.779 --> 4046.72
following rivers definitely and yeah

4044.859 --> 4050.2599999999998
there's just indications that there was

4046.72 --> 4053.319
probably a large mud event where

4050.26 --> 4055.42
suddenly mud came out of the mountains

4053.319 --> 4058.779
it's not entirely clear where it came

4055.42 --> 4061.9300000000003
from some speculated was just coming out

4058.779 --> 4063.19
of the mountains some say yeah the

4061.93 --> 4065.23
ground turned to mud and everything

4063.19 --> 4067.21
things sank in it but that doesn't

4065.23 --> 4069.029
really make any sense because then if

4067.21 --> 4071.559
that were the case you would be seeing

4069.029 --> 4074.559
slanted buildings all over the place and

4071.559 --> 4077.23
I've never seen that really in any of

4074.559 --> 4079.029
the photos that Martin presented so I

4077.23 --> 4081.4900000000002
don't think that is the case but there

4079.029 --> 4082.299
was mud that's basically it there was a

4081.49 --> 4086.2889999999998
lot of mud

4082.299 --> 4090.319
it changed the landscape significantly

4086.289 --> 4094.7290000000003
and that changed society in its own turn

4090.319 --> 4098.0
and spawned a lot of the kingdoms of the

4094.729 --> 4102.409
European kingdoms like kingdoms were

4098.0 --> 4106.04
erected out of a what seemed massive mud

4102.409 --> 4111.848999999999
flood event which wasn't the last one

4106.04 --> 4117.5289999999995
probably no it's just it's a very wide

4111.849 --> 4123.049
complicated story right we sell many

4117.529 --> 4128.75
things we have to figure out go ahead

4123.049 --> 4130.659
Chris you me to care my court story from

4128.75 --> 4135.619
yesterday

4130.659 --> 4136.7789999999995
okay this end well yeah I was on discord

4135.619 --> 4140.8589999999995
yesterday and that's where I got those

4136.779 --> 4140.859
memes that Jose was posting

4141.87 --> 4146.49
right anyways I was on one of these I

4144.93 --> 4149.700000000001
think it was Jim and his Dysport server

4146.49 --> 4152.04
I don't know how to I had it pretty

4149.7 --> 4155.16
lengthy maybe hour long debate with Mike

4152.04 --> 4156.87
I don't know it's hard to tell they're

4155.16 --> 4158.2699999999995
always you know multiple people talking

4156.87 --> 4161.9
about between five and ten different

4158.27 --> 4163.950000000001
baller people on that discord server and

4161.9 --> 4166.08
mostly talked about gravity

4163.95 --> 4168.42
Cavendish I got a couple good

4166.08 --> 4171.42
concessions one was that Cavendish is

4168.42 --> 4175.9400000000005
not an experiment to prove gravity but

4171.42 --> 4178.5
is it is a test to measure gravity which

4175.94 --> 4179.91
okay so we're halfway there so you know

4178.5 --> 4181.23
okay but how do you know what's

4179.91 --> 4183.03
measuring gravity right not something

4181.23 --> 4185.339999999999
something else I couldn't get them to

4183.03 --> 4187.05
concede that basically they were saying

4185.34 --> 4189.12
oh well no Cavendish was designed to

4187.05 --> 4191.97
measure gravity right and I'm like wall

4189.12 --> 4193.59
how do you know that I mean right was

4191.97 --> 4194.79
how do you know what's measured or

4193.59 --> 4197.46
designed to measure something else

4194.79 --> 4198.99
you're just it's a formula it's Nathan's

4197.46 --> 4202.53
forma logical fallacy right

4198.99 --> 4205.13
if balls move you know if I create this

4202.53 --> 4207.87
device and balls move therefore gravity

4205.13 --> 4209.37
we're sorry if gravity exists and I

4207.87 --> 4211.17
built this device balls will move what

4209.37 --> 4213.54
balls move therefore gravity right kind

4211.17 --> 4214.92
of thing so they're just sort of they're

4213.54 --> 4219.09
reaffirming the consequent already

4214.92 --> 4220.47
before they have done the test but

4219.09 --> 4224.16
either way so I got a couple good

4220.47 --> 4225.81
concessions out of it and then just as

4224.16 --> 4228.51
far as the Jose stuff goes he just was

4225.81 --> 4230.04
posting somebody I think I have to

4228.51 --> 4232.5
reread it but somebody just as asking

4230.04 --> 4235.35
him to post there like Oh posted Nathan

4232.5 --> 4236.85
Oakley name so he posted posted a couple

4235.35 --> 4239.820000000001
of those memes I only grabbed the wand

4236.85 --> 4241.740000000001
there was another one that had a note

4239.82 --> 4244.23
Nathan's face on it you know make making

4241.74 --> 4245.55
fun of him pretty much and there's

4244.23 --> 4247.23
really no reason he did it other than

4245.55 --> 4248.76
you suppose the baller destined to and

4247.23 --> 4250.5599999999995
he just did it you know he wants to fit

4248.76 --> 4253.1900000000005
in now and he wants to be their new

4250.56 --> 4253.1900000000005
friends so

4255.85 --> 4262.280000000001
and then he got mad at me because I

4258.05 --> 4264.71
posted it in our our skype group and I'm

4262.28 --> 4266.21
like well that's no that's what you get

4264.71 --> 4268.1
man like you don't you don't be going

4266.21 --> 4269.66
around posting stuff online if you

4268.1 --> 4270.950000000001
against other people's backs if you

4269.66 --> 4276.83
don't want them to find out about it

4270.95 --> 4278.03
right don't be blaming me like I it's

4276.83 --> 4281.65
basically like I caught him cheating and

4278.03 --> 4281.65
I told I told the girlfriend you know

4284.709 --> 4289.57
but anyways that was it not a big deal

4286.51 --> 4292.059
to start had some fun with the ballers

4289.57 --> 4293.829
yesterday and got a goddess consent of

4292.059 --> 4295.719
interesting concession or two out of

4293.829 --> 4296.978999999999
them but you know they did they're

4295.719 --> 4298.51
pressing harder Court you know that a

4296.979 --> 4300.639
lot of their arguments aren't oh well if

4298.51 --> 4302.110000000001
we convince you like you're so they're

4300.639 --> 4303.28
so concerned about us coming back to the

4302.11 --> 4304.478999999999
ball you know they're like oh if we

4303.28 --> 4306.67
convinced you that grab your drill

4304.479 --> 4307.84
you'll come back right sounds like well

4306.67 --> 4310.78
oh yeah absolutely you know if you

4307.84 --> 4312.999
convince me but after an hour you know I

4310.78 --> 4315.759999999999
was I still wasn't convinced you know

4312.999 --> 4318.459
that all their theories are math this

4315.76 --> 4320.249
and not that you know anything yeah F

4318.459 --> 4323.219
equals MA so therefore there's of course

4320.249 --> 4325.179
all that kind of nonsense well hey I

4323.219 --> 4328.03
didn't mean to hijack but I'd have to

4325.179 --> 4330.55
drop yeah Chris where were you uh were

4328.03 --> 4334.809
you in there when when Jim and Sandy

4330.55 --> 4343.150000000001
were going at it no I wasn't what were

4334.809 --> 4346.719
they going at her out over Debbie no

4343.15 --> 4350.049999999999
basically basically soundly was bullying

4346.719 --> 4353.92
and Debbie I don't know what was said

4350.05 --> 4356.860000000001
but in you know Jim Panda obviously took

4353.92 --> 4360.999
up for Debbie Sally didn't like that and

4356.86 --> 4363.179
so they set there and cussing each other

4360.999 --> 4369.82
out for a while Oh

4363.179 --> 4372.219
basically Jim Jim Panda is is he's a

4369.82 --> 4384.28
control freak is what is what is he was

4372.219 --> 4385.9
like Jim panic you think I think I was I

4384.28 --> 4388.869
wish we could get everybody to do a

4385.9 --> 4392.049999999999
video calling out Jim Panda it would be

4388.869 --> 4395.018999999999
awesome oh really for him and that

4392.05 --> 4397.269
famous overnight we did that no that

4395.019 --> 4399.34
dudes in cancer man yeah and he'd be a

4397.269 --> 4403.659000000001
famous cancer overnight

4399.34 --> 4405.610000000001
so don't recommend it yeah oh but you

4403.659 --> 4407.17
say yeah I guess defending Debbie

4405.61 --> 4409.38
against soundly rights that's kind of

4407.17 --> 4409.38
good

4411.02 --> 4418.2300000000005
soundy at least does like footage

4415.91 --> 4422.96
yeah but sound is the worst team because

4418.23 --> 4426.15
his his footage is so bad like it's not

4422.96 --> 4429.0
you know it's there it's reality but he

4426.15 --> 4430.71
they misconstrued the the result tried

4429.0 --> 4433.56
to say oh it's curvature well its

4430.71 --> 4435.96
curvature the last you know 20 miles

4433.56 --> 4438.93
long but you know six miles just eight

4435.96 --> 4442.02
miles compressed right on that Ridge but

4438.93 --> 4445.46
that's what ballers do Dante that's what

4442.02 --> 4448.080000000001
they always do like even Jose does it

4445.46 --> 4449.34
got this amazing footage its curvature

4448.08 --> 4452.73
because that's the only thing I

4449.34 --> 4454.29
understand and yeah that they're always

4452.73 --> 4458.759999999999
going to do that at least they are
