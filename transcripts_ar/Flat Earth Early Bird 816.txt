bright sun out there

really nice outside

154.879 --> 161.76
nice and warm hi

158.48 --> 170.23899999999998
so let's use in chat

161.76 --> 173.04
tom parker's first good morning

170.239 --> 173.68
i'm glad i glad that i figured out the

173.04 --> 176.879
microphone

173.68 --> 176.87900000000002
was on mute in time

181.2 --> 185.83999999999997
got green tea

186.879 --> 195.76
and it's thursday the 25th

190.959 --> 195.76
of february 2021

196.8 --> 201.84
and i feel pretty good today much more

200.4 --> 205.20000000000002
relaxed than yesterday

201.84 --> 210.239
weather is also helping but

205.2 --> 213.28
yeah yeah had some good communications

210.239 --> 216.879
with the uh

213.28 --> 216.879
well the social worker group

217.04 --> 222.79899999999998
like the local one here and

220.799 --> 224.799
yeah i think i'm i'm going to be able to

222.799 --> 228.959
get the uh

224.799 --> 231.59900000000002
the landlord situation fixed

228.959 --> 232.959
and they basically backed up my like the

231.599 --> 236.07999999999998
preliminary

232.959 --> 238.48
of it was that

236.08 --> 240.15900000000002
well i got backed up what i what i

238.48 --> 242.64
thought deep down

240.159 --> 243.519
right not what i felt but what i thought

242.64 --> 246.72
so it was

243.519 --> 246.72
very reassuring

247.12 --> 252.56
and yeah i think i'm gonna be all right

253.439 --> 258.32
still a little nervous nervous but not

255.76 --> 262.4
as badly

258.32 --> 262.4
so yeah overall feel a lot better today

265.12 --> 268.479
which is great because when it's this

266.96 --> 270.32
kind of weather

268.479 --> 273.44
you really just want to be relaxed so

270.32 --> 276.24
you can just soak up

273.44 --> 276.24
the good light

276.8 --> 283.84000000000003
and the nice smells of nature outside

287.28 --> 292.01
so yeah yesterday i

290.479 --> 294.0
put the note block

292.01 --> 295.919
[Music]

294.0 --> 298.479
in my back and i forgot to make notes

295.919 --> 298.479
because of that

302.4 --> 307.84
in general i have to have the thing

304.32 --> 310.0
inside it basically popping in my sights

307.84 --> 312.56
because that reminds me to make notes if

310.0 --> 315.68
i don't see the noteblock then

312.56 --> 315.68
i completely forget

321.68 --> 327.039
all right ending up with lift fail

331.199 --> 339.28000000000003
watching south park particularly

335.36 --> 342.8
the part

339.28 --> 345.67999999999995
where stan's dad reveals that he is

342.8 --> 348.08
lord so you know on that like where in

345.68 --> 351.12
the series i'm roughly at

348.08 --> 352.0
this just it's funny and it's amazing

351.12 --> 354.9
and it's

352.0 --> 356.16
interesting close up

354.9 --> 358.79999999999995
[Music]

356.16 --> 360.88000000000005
on societal things it's i don't know i

358.8 --> 363.84000000000003
think it's very interesting

360.88 --> 365.44
to me it was a big revelation and an

363.84 --> 369.11999999999995
insight

365.44 --> 369.12
what goes on in the minds

369.199 --> 373.759
people that go there anyway

376.319 --> 380.56
where is everybody i see tom parker in

379.44 --> 383.84
chat

380.56 --> 387.12
and that's it did anybody

383.84 --> 395.59999999999997
everybody get a notification

387.12 --> 398.96
me going live

395.6 --> 402.47900000000004
it says there's 10 watching i hope

398.96 --> 402.479
more people come and chat soon

404.319 --> 409.84000000000003
what else what else

410.639 --> 417.28000000000003
i'm all you need uh okay

414.72 --> 420.0
right i watch some home benjamin

417.28 --> 420.0
remember that

420.84 --> 423.84
[ __ ]

430.96 --> 441.12
and i remember watching some alex jones

436.319 --> 441.12
i usually do in the evening my evenings

442.08 --> 451.84
there afternoon

458.8 --> 464.40000000000003
oh i did come across like a disturbing

462.56 --> 466.4
little article it's not hard to

464.4 --> 469.52
come across disturbing articles these

466.4 --> 469.52
days but

473.84 --> 481.599
was this natural news article

478.879 --> 484.16
like bill gates is trying to develop

481.599 --> 486.87899999999996
some really high-tech

484.16 --> 489.28000000000003
ai censorship tools and that is

486.879 --> 491.12
worrisome

489.28 --> 492.479
because i think he's trying to develop a

491.12 --> 495.599
system where people can

492.479 --> 499.919
literally be

495.599 --> 503.039
profiled by the by their activity

499.919 --> 506.4
and then recognized and basically

503.039 --> 509.68
shadow banned just everywhere

506.4 --> 510.79999999999995
on the internet everywhere like it'll

509.68 --> 513.519
just

510.8 --> 516.08
have a filter recognize you even if you

513.519 --> 518.399
try to do something anonymous

516.08 --> 521.839
that sort of thing it's really creepy

518.399 --> 521.839
when i came across that

522.159 --> 527.92
i guess i'll share the article if you

524.88 --> 535.8389999999999
think it's worth taking a look

527.92 --> 535.8389999999999
hey terry 306 indie fonsens

550.959 --> 554.88
all right so every time like these

553.839 --> 557.7600000000001
people

554.88 --> 558.8
like bill gates and mega rich crazy

557.76 --> 560.64
people

558.8 --> 562.0
they have all this power to basically

560.64 --> 563.6
develop things the problem

562.0 --> 565.44
is though that whatever they're going to

563.6 --> 569.519
be developing it's going to be

565.44 --> 569.519
bad for everyone except them

569.92 --> 577.279
and so every time i see something like

571.839 --> 579.839
that i get worried

577.279 --> 580.56
because everything they do big project

579.839 --> 585.36
wise is

580.56 --> 588.399
always to screw everyone else up

585.36 --> 591.36
it really is might start out kind of

588.399 --> 594.32
decent and then they will turn it

591.36 --> 594.88
to the other side and it'll absolutely

594.32 --> 598.24
just

594.88 --> 601.4399999999999
create more

598.24 --> 605.839
feudal alike situations

601.44 --> 605.839
it's terrible

609.519 --> 611.76
so

614.0 --> 619.839
that caught my eye other than that

624.079 --> 629.519
let's see let's see in youtube when was

627.04 --> 629.519
going down

630.079 --> 633.8389999999999
oh yeah also what dell

634.0 --> 639.04
got a bit of that but but he's been

636.56 --> 643.92
having some streaming problems

639.04 --> 643.92
don't know whether it's his internet or

644.839 --> 649.6
youtube

647.519 --> 651.44
but his chat is always pretty fun to

649.6 --> 654.24
hang around with there's a lot of people

651.44 --> 654.24
that get in there

656.8 --> 661.8389999999999
hey ajm dr gonzo

662.399 --> 667.519
so exa dr gonzo since you're now

665.44 --> 675.839
actually calling yourself a doctor what

667.519 --> 675.839
are you a doctor of exactly

677.12 --> 679.92
tiny one more

681.2 --> 689.839
let's get ready to warm

691.279 --> 706.399
phd in internet memes okay

703.12 --> 708.32
because people just love to attain these

706.399 --> 711.2
titles

708.32 --> 712.639
and i bet that it all starts kind of

711.2 --> 714.32
like a larp

712.639 --> 716.0790000000001
you know it it kind of starts out like

714.32 --> 719.0400000000001
oh it's just a thing on the internet

716.079 --> 719.4399999999999
i'm just gonna make this character i'm

719.04 --> 722.079
gonna

719.44 --> 723.6
like call him a doctor or do something

722.079 --> 726.3199999999999
else

723.6 --> 728.72
and then you get into it and then it's

726.32 --> 730.639
like okay people are just responding in

728.72 --> 735.279
that way

730.639 --> 735.279
so i kind of want it to be real

735.44 --> 745.839
right there's that problem

746.32 --> 751.839
so every time somebody calls themselves

748.32 --> 756.839
a doctor of anything it's always

751.839 --> 759.7600000000001
yeah like if that would have been

756.839 --> 763.2790000000001
like okay

759.76 --> 766.639
in my moral opinion and i'm very strict

763.279 --> 769.68
on such things than

766.639 --> 772.0
with words and truth then i would just

769.68 --> 787.8389999999999
why wouldn't i have called myself dr

772.0 --> 787.839
arwin then right

789.6 --> 796.0790000000001
but anyway it doesn't really matter

793.04 --> 798.8
i'm just arwin and hey i do

796.079 --> 801.519
have my own layman's medical advice and

798.8 --> 804.8
insights that i share

801.519 --> 807.68
tips that i give to people that i think

804.8 --> 807.68
actually wanted

808.24 --> 811.76
because there's so much hassle going

810.24 --> 814.72
around and

811.76 --> 815.6
diffusion and information sourcing and

814.72 --> 818.8000000000001
all that

815.6 --> 821.839
it's difficult to figure out

818.8 --> 822.3199999999999
or to have like a stable route that

821.839 --> 824.8000000000001
stays

822.32 --> 826.32
stable into the future on the internet

824.8 --> 828.079
it's tough

826.32 --> 830.9590000000001
because it's all kind of diffusing

828.079 --> 830.959
getting chaotic

834.32 --> 838.9590000000001
it takes years to obtain the doctor

837.199 --> 841.3599999999999
title

838.959 --> 843.04
intense studying right but studying of

841.36 --> 846.399
what exactly

843.04 --> 850.24
because i've been studying this

846.399 --> 851.12
being me figuring myself out psychology

850.24 --> 854.399
and

851.12 --> 855.519
beyond into spiritual sensories and all

854.399 --> 859.04
that

855.519 --> 861.04
that's my life's work i've been studying

859.04 --> 864.079
that for

861.04 --> 864.88
i don't know almost 30 years like

864.079 --> 867.519
actively

864.88 --> 870.48
it's just not a registered thing it's

867.519 --> 873.36
just my own study my layman study

870.48 --> 874.0790000000001
so does that qualify me to call myself a

873.36 --> 877.92
doctor then

874.079 --> 881.12
see it's kind of difficult

877.92 --> 883.36
what is a doctor is a doctor a title

881.12 --> 885.6
you you can only attain if you get a

883.36 --> 890.5600000000001
paper of some kind

885.6 --> 890.5600000000001
very specific or is it not so specific

891.04 --> 899.4399999999999
see it's another colloquialism problem

895.839 --> 902.399
like the cultural idea of

899.44 --> 902.9590000000001
a doctor title just like the cultural

902.399 --> 908.32
idea

902.959 --> 913.3599999999999
of science right colloquialism

908.32 --> 916.0
it's a similar problem

913.36 --> 919.36
and if on average you're allowed to get

916.0 --> 921.68
away to just call yourself a doctor

919.36 --> 921.6800000000001
then

924.959 --> 930.4799999999999
yeah then a lot of people are just going

926.959 --> 933.279
to do that to try and get some edge

930.48 --> 936.399
to maybe get a little bit of an edge

933.279 --> 938.24
peer pressure wise over other people

936.399 --> 939.44
doesn't necessarily have to be nefarious

938.24 --> 941.12
but they will try it

939.44 --> 943.6800000000001
lots of people try that especially on

941.12 --> 943.68
the internet

948.56 --> 954.4799999999999
so but then again if you

951.759 --> 956.9590000000001
are pretty much anonymous on the

954.48 --> 956.9590000000001
internet

957.199 --> 964.639
or just a comment or not like

961.36 --> 966.88
giving out specific medical advice

964.639 --> 968.0
and trying to sell books or something i

966.88 --> 971.68
think that it's okay

968.0 --> 973.68
then on the other hand i'm i might

971.68 --> 975.04
be mistaken but i think that there are

973.68 --> 978.4799999999999
people out there doing

975.04 --> 981.36
just that and just it's perfectly fine

978.48 --> 983.839
so nobody goes after them maybe some

981.36 --> 983.839
comments

988.72 --> 990.9590000000001
uh

991.839 --> 997.36
okay agm please the the caps is not

995.12 --> 1011.839
helping

997.36 --> 1011.839
also you get your spelling wrong

1015.6 --> 1020.16
all right spinning dope spinning ball

1017.759 --> 1020.16
doctor

1020.48 --> 1025.839
i don't think that's really deserving of

1022.88 --> 1025.839
a real doctor title

1027.439 --> 1030.64
anyway it's okay i'm not trying to push

1030.24 --> 1032.48
you

1030.64 --> 1033.76
on like oh you have to change your name

1032.48 --> 1036.319
or anything it's just that

1033.76 --> 1038.16
i wonder that sometimes you know people

1036.319 --> 1040.559
take on certain type of

1038.16 --> 1043.039
type of titles as their internet

1040.559 --> 1043.039
character

1043.36 --> 1048.559
but what does it even really mean and

1045.36 --> 1048.559
what does it do to people

1050.64 --> 1054.24
your head is spinning tough

1057.12 --> 1062.08
uh if your body remains stationary

1059.28 --> 1062.08
that's kind of tough

1064.08 --> 1067.84
it's very tough on your neck

1087.84 --> 1094.0
harsh terror 306

1090.88 --> 1098.24
come on dr gonzo

1094.0 --> 1109.2
is not mean right he may be a clover

1098.24 --> 1111.6
but he's not mean

1109.2 --> 1113.039
the doctor title basically means you

1111.6 --> 1115.84
know what you're talking about

1113.039 --> 1117.679
well that's what it suggests

1115.84 --> 1123.84
colloquially

1117.679 --> 1123.8400000000001
that's what how people respond to it

1126.16 --> 1129.3600000000001
did you hear anything about the roger

1128.16 --> 1133.76
land police station

1129.36 --> 1136.799
no what

1133.76 --> 1139.52
i have no idea

1136.799 --> 1139.84
i didn't come across anything then again

1139.52 --> 1143.679
my

1139.84 --> 1143.6789999999999
sources don't dig very deep

1144.16 --> 1150.24
they dig wider so

1147.28 --> 1151.6
yeah it's not hard to miss unless it

1150.24 --> 1155.44
eventually

1151.6 --> 1165.84
basically floats up to the wider

1155.44 --> 1165.8400000000001
alternative media

1174.4 --> 1178.0
oh and by the way i've been through

1176.96 --> 1180.799
those sources

1178.0 --> 1182.64
that zoom in very much on behavior of

1180.799 --> 1184.4
like the prime minister and minister of

1182.64 --> 1187.2
health here in the netherlands

1184.4 --> 1187.6000000000001
and i'm getting this odd odd sensation

1187.2 --> 1191.3600000000001
this

1187.6 --> 1194.3999999999999
really weird synchronicity thing

1191.36 --> 1197.6789999999999
and that's like these guys are acting

1194.4 --> 1200.72
like baller zealots

1197.679 --> 1200.72
but politician

1201.039 --> 1207.36
that's what they're doing they're like

1204.32 --> 1210.96
grompusing and and

1207.36 --> 1213.1999999999998
just all these things that

1210.96 --> 1214.32
real serious baller zealots do in the

1213.2 --> 1218.159
trenches

1214.32 --> 1221.84
that's what they're doing in politics

1218.159 --> 1221.8400000000001
it's crazy

1222.08 --> 1227.28
and they got smiles on their faces all

1224.08 --> 1229.84
the way it's so bizarre

1227.28 --> 1235.84
to feel that synchronicity there it's

1229.84 --> 1235.84
like what

1239.039 --> 1251.039
okay dr gonzo

1248.24 --> 1251.6
you get it seeking star wars right but

1251.039 --> 1255.12
because

1251.6 --> 1256.24
it is it is specifically the dutch

1255.12 --> 1259.28
politicians

1256.24 --> 1261.36
it seems these two guys that are now

1259.28 --> 1264.24
kind of like forcing the corona [ __ ]

1261.36 --> 1265.9189999999999
and pulling all kinds of tricks they

1264.24 --> 1268.559
really seem

1265.919 --> 1269.919
in their in their attitude and how they

1268.559 --> 1272.559
respond to things and

1269.919 --> 1273.6000000000001
just their composure they seem like like

1272.559 --> 1276.72
a rumpus or something

1273.6 --> 1279.36
it's bizarre it's really bizarre

1276.72 --> 1280.0
what they're trying and i don't really

1279.36 --> 1282.9599999999998
see it

1280.0 --> 1284.48
on that level everywhere else there's

1282.96 --> 1287.52
been a lot of

1284.48 --> 1291.28
like very autocratic autocratic

1287.52 --> 1293.6
attitudes and pushing

1291.28 --> 1296.48
in other fronts and other places by

1293.6 --> 1305.84
other politicians

1296.48 --> 1305.84
but not this sophisticated mind trickery

1318.48 --> 1322.559
hey you new consentino yeah i agree

1322.96 --> 1326.08
politicians are not there for our best

1325.2 --> 1329.3600000000001
interests not

1326.08 --> 1333.84
well some of them maybe but the career

1329.36 --> 1333.84
politicians they're all

1334.96 --> 1338.08
they're all well they're conspiring in a

1337.12 --> 1341.36
bigger plan

1338.08 --> 1342.8799999999999
for that them as a class

1341.36 --> 1345.1999999999998
like they're trying to create a new

1342.88 --> 1347.8400000000001
class

1345.2 --> 1347.8400000000001
like the

1348.96 --> 1353.28
well as we as i learned in history like

1350.96 --> 1354.32
the bourgeoisie was trying to create an

1353.28 --> 1356.72
industrial

1354.32 --> 1358.559
class supposedly right and now they're

1356.72 --> 1360.72
destroying that

1358.559 --> 1364.24
as the ones that originally created it

1360.72 --> 1366.88
become the mega oligarchs

1364.24 --> 1368.72
and stay there stay keep that under

1366.88 --> 1375.0390000000002
their control

1368.72 --> 1377.76
and now it's moving on to this

1375.039 --> 1379.52
it's the politic the politics is trying

1377.76 --> 1383.2
their class thing and they are

1379.52 --> 1387.2
like a guilt you could

1383.2 --> 1390.64
call political wise the new world order

1387.2 --> 1391.6000000000001
like it's like a guild if you're not in

1390.64 --> 1395.1200000000001
the guild

1391.6 --> 1398.24
then you are the enemy through

1395.12 --> 1401.12
through secrecy and stealth or

1398.24 --> 1403.2
just overtly and with all the prop

1401.12 --> 1406.2399999999998
smearing propaganda on top

1403.2 --> 1410.24
very on a very refined

1406.24 --> 1412.48
cohesive level like very persistently

1410.24 --> 1413.039
like do you know exactly what you can

1412.48 --> 1415.6
expect

1413.039 --> 1418.48
how they'll how they will roll out such

1415.6 --> 1420.48
propaganda against

1418.48 --> 1422.799
politicians that are not part of the

1420.48 --> 1422.799
guild

1423.6 --> 1427.1999999999998
so if it feels very much like the 21st

1426.4 --> 1429.3600000000001
century

1427.2 --> 1430.32
and maybe late late 20th century has

1429.36 --> 1432.9189999999999
this new

1430.32 --> 1435.12
class formation just like in the

1432.919 --> 1438.96
industrialization

1435.12 --> 1440.559
the nouveau riche separated from the

1438.96 --> 1443.76
nobility

1440.559 --> 1445.2
like from the public side rose up as

1443.76 --> 1446.96
non-nobility

1445.2 --> 1449.039
and became a new class and now the

1446.96 --> 1451.44
politicians are create trying to create

1449.039 --> 1454.8799999999999
this technocratic neo-feudalism

1451.44 --> 1459.679
and they are trying to form their own

1454.88 --> 1461.679
class in guild formation

1459.679 --> 1462.72
it's very much what it feels like and

1461.679 --> 1473.8400000000001
looks like

1462.72 --> 1473.84
to me

1474.159 --> 1478.48
so yeah first there's like the political

1476.48 --> 1481.6
nobility then you have the

1478.48 --> 1483.2
nouveau riche oligarchy financial

1481.6 --> 1485.279
nobility

1483.2 --> 1487.44
and now you're they're attempting like a

1485.279 --> 1490.32
political nobility

1487.44 --> 1491.52
so it's all these guilds effectively

1490.32 --> 1494.6399999999999
forming

1491.52 --> 1494.6399999999999
over over time

1497.76 --> 1502.559
the new covet vaccinated yeah that's the

1500.24 --> 1505.2
opposing class that's like the new

1502.559 --> 1506.24
level of slave class it's like the

1505.2 --> 1508.159
public

1506.24 --> 1515.84
mind slave class that's what they're

1508.159 --> 1515.8400000000001
also trying to do

1516.48 --> 1524.799
but it's also fascinating that in ways

1520.96 --> 1524.799
you can still stay out of it

1526.4 --> 1530.0800000000002
like the slave cat class is really

1528.88 --> 1533.279
formed

1530.08 --> 1536.08
through trickery and volunteerism

1533.279 --> 1539.12
from people actually buying into it and

1536.08 --> 1539.12
then championing it

1541.44 --> 1545.279
very similar to the spinning ball

1544.32 --> 1548.0
religion

1545.279 --> 1548.72
by the way that's how it operated as

1548.0 --> 1551.52
well

1548.72 --> 1552.64
introduced in the schools people buy

1551.52 --> 1555.679
into it

1552.64 --> 1556.0800000000002
love it they get reinforced through

1555.679 --> 1558.1200000000001
science

1556.08 --> 1559.84
fiction and all that encouraged

1558.12 --> 1562.08
incentivized

1559.84 --> 1562.8799999999999
and then they champion it not knowing

1562.08 --> 1567.039
it's not

1562.88 --> 1567.0390000000002
real not knowing they've been full

1567.679 --> 1574.88
and with the covid class you could say

1572.08 --> 1576.24
it's the same thing and it is kind of

1574.88 --> 1579.44
the political class

1576.24 --> 1583.039
that is their controllers

1579.44 --> 1586.24
like nasa is supposed to be the baller

1583.039 --> 1590.0
controllers priesthood see how this

1586.24 --> 1590.0
formation works

1593.6 --> 1599.039
it's so good to have a lot more clarity

1596.64 --> 1602.7990000000002
instead of just nerves and i can put

1599.039 --> 1602.799
down these things much more eloquently

1603.44 --> 1607.1200000000001
nerves really do get in the way of my

1605.76 --> 1610.84
cohesion

1607.12 --> 1613.84
when it comes to like thinking out the

1610.84 --> 1613.84
structures

1623.039 --> 1628.64
poor russians they are being mass

1624.88 --> 1628.64
vaccinated by force oh really

1637.76 --> 1643.44
and how much

1641.32 --> 1644.8799999999999
post-vaccination deaths do they have

1643.44 --> 1655.8400000000001
because i've heard that they

1644.88 --> 1655.8400000000001
just give basically a placebo just water

1656.48 --> 1660.32
because if it was real yeah that would

1658.48 --> 1662.559
mean a lot of deaths

1660.32 --> 1664.1589999999999
kind of like in israel where they did

1662.559 --> 1666.48
really

1664.159 --> 1669.0390000000002
kind of force it on everybody or i don't

1666.48 --> 1671.1200000000001
know did they really force it or it just

1669.039 --> 1672.32
or they were just it was too tough to

1671.12 --> 1674.2399999999998
not do it i don't know

1672.32 --> 1676.0
exactly how it happened in israel but

1674.24 --> 1677.919
i've been hearing a lot of deaths from

1676.0 --> 1679.6
there

1677.919 --> 1682.88
not so much with russia i haven't heard

1679.6 --> 1684.6399999999999
that and i do follow russia today

1682.88 --> 1686.48
these days so if something like that

1684.64 --> 1688.72
would have happened

1686.48 --> 1690.08
then they would have at least recognized

1688.72 --> 1692.88
it was there and either

1690.08 --> 1693.9189999999999
been very apologetic or defensive or

1692.88 --> 1697.44
just

1693.919 --> 1700.72
critical they would

1697.44 --> 1700.72
mention it so

1709.52 --> 1714.6399999999999
there is a mandatory vaccine scheme

1711.52 --> 1714.6399999999999
inflates yeah no [ __ ]

1714.799 --> 1720.0
there they want to try it like even

1717.76 --> 1720.799
these dutch politicians over here and

1720.0 --> 1723.6
european

1720.799 --> 1724.399
they they aren't like saying it like we

1723.6 --> 1727.12
have to

1724.399 --> 1728.6399999999999
they keep saying it even though nobody

1727.12 --> 1739.84
agrees

1728.64 --> 1739.8400000000001
only insane people and eugenicists

1746.159 --> 1752.64
like they can't really force it you do

1749.52 --> 1753.84
realize that right legally they can't

1752.64 --> 1758.7990000000002
really force it

1753.84 --> 1762.48
but what they can do is buy up as much

1758.799 --> 1765.279
systems that we've all gotten used to

1762.48 --> 1766.0
and relying upon in society whatever

1765.279 --> 1769.279
that society

1766.0 --> 1770.24
is like buy it up and then if you want

1769.279 --> 1772.24
to use it

1770.24 --> 1774.48
then you have to do it that's what they

1772.24 --> 1776.919
can do so that's why

1774.48 --> 1778.64
just and a general outlook of

1776.919 --> 1783.44
self-reliance

1778.64 --> 1786.159
is critical to be able to evade it

1783.44 --> 1786.799
because if you are entangled in society

1786.159 --> 1789.919
you

1786.799 --> 1790.399
demand that these things are normal even

1789.919 --> 1794.0800000000002
though

1790.399 --> 1796.6399999999999
it's being phased out as normal and

1794.08 --> 1796.6399999999999
becoming

1797.76 --> 1802.0
requirement based you have to supposedly

1800.88 --> 1805.5200000000002
have the vaccine

1802.0 --> 1810.96
well then it's it's gone

1805.52 --> 1813.76
that simply means that's gone to trash

1810.96 --> 1814.559
it's no longer a reliable system so you

1813.76 --> 1817.919
must

1814.559 --> 1817.9189999999999
somehow bypass it

1818.72 --> 1822.24
and there's plenty of people that kind

1821.039 --> 1826.24
of realize that

1822.24 --> 1830.559
and are trying to form alternatives

1826.24 --> 1830.559
in all kinds of places

1834.64 --> 1839.76
but self-reliance and that mindset of

1836.96 --> 1841.52
self-reliance is just critical

1839.76 --> 1842.8799999999999
just because otherwise you're going to

1841.52 --> 1844.559
get seduced you're going to be

1842.88 --> 1846.0800000000002
confronted with so many things like you

1844.559 --> 1846.96
wanted to do and then it's like oh no

1846.08 --> 1849.279
you have to

1846.96 --> 1851.039
get that freaking vaccination then yeah

1849.279 --> 1853.6
how long before you just

1851.039 --> 1855.679
are sick of wanting to do certain things

1853.6 --> 1859.9189999999999
not being able to do it

1855.679 --> 1865.8400000000001
so you get the freaking thing you engage

1859.919 --> 1865.8400000000001
and then the nightmare really starts

1866.559 --> 1870.6399999999999
right so that's just the reality we're

1869.84 --> 1874.1589999999999
faced with

1870.64 --> 1874.96
we've been given all kinds of society

1874.159 --> 1878.24
societal

1874.96 --> 1881.3600000000001
luxuries that we

1878.24 --> 1884.0
took for granted and thought were ours

1881.36 --> 1885.279
that we were doing that right we thought

1884.0 --> 1887.919
that just because we had

1885.279 --> 1888.88
jobs and or some people out there had

1887.919 --> 1892.3990000000001
jobs in there

1888.88 --> 1895.3600000000001
right and now we are faced with the

1892.399 --> 1896.399
actual control structure and they're

1895.36 --> 1901.12
just showing us

1896.399 --> 1901.12
no you just do the work

1905.519 --> 1910.0
right how things really work are now

1908.72 --> 1913.279
revealed

1910.0 --> 1914.799
because if some thing can force people

1913.279 --> 1918.0
to take vaccines or

1914.799 --> 1918.6399999999999
stay out then it's not free it's not

1918.0 --> 1922.08
yours

1918.64 --> 1924.5590000000002
that means it's theirs

1922.08 --> 1926.48
they've claimed it like and hey this

1924.559 --> 1928.8799999999999
[ __ ] happened way in the past too you

1926.48 --> 1932.08
know before this modern society

1928.88 --> 1932.72
nobility would just get iffy about

1932.08 --> 1936.6399999999999
something

1932.72 --> 1939.1200000000001
like some business guy or whatever

1936.64 --> 1939.8400000000001
a guy on a market was too successful

1939.12 --> 1942.1589999999999
they would just

1939.84 --> 1944.0
freaking come in and claim it under

1942.159 --> 1946.3990000000001
threat of violence

1944.0 --> 1948.159
and they would be legally allowed to do

1946.399 --> 1950.399
that and then it was theirs

1948.159 --> 1951.279
and then the guy would have to just do

1950.399 --> 1955.12
what they wanted

1951.279 --> 1958.96
or die yeah that's how they did it

1955.12 --> 1960.8799999999999
during feudal times doesn't it sound

1958.96 --> 1965.039
familiar

1960.88 --> 1967.679
doesn't it huh huh

1965.039 --> 1970.08
political nobility coming in just saying

1967.679 --> 1972.0800000000002
no you must do this or you have to close

1970.08 --> 1975.1999999999998
down or hear these giant finds

1972.08 --> 1980.48
sound familiar yeah

1975.2 --> 1980.48
say flashback to the past of feudalism

1980.72 --> 1985.3600000000001
how do you like that you thought it was

1983.919 --> 1988.7990000000002
yours

1985.36 --> 1989.6
no now this is how it works now and you

1988.799 --> 1993.44
gotta learn

1989.6 --> 1996.399
to live with it and survive it

1993.44 --> 1998.24
and be self-reliant and hey people in

1996.399 --> 1998.9599999999998
those times were self-reliant too there

1998.24 --> 2002.159
were

1998.96 --> 2004.159
lots of exploits and things and little

2002.159 --> 2006.3200000000002
conspiracies business conspiracies and

2004.159 --> 2009.279
all that

2006.32 --> 2011.36
but they knew like if you are like

2009.279 --> 2012.88
trying to own everything the nobility

2011.36 --> 2016.1589999999999
will come in and freaking

2012.88 --> 2018.159
take it from you because they don't like

2016.159 --> 2020.7990000000002
power competition or attention

2018.159 --> 2020.7990000000002
competition

2025.2 --> 2032.0
right and that's happening again

2028.24 --> 2037.44
with neo-feudalism based

2032.0 --> 2037.44
on technocracy and media

2038.08 --> 2043.36
well yeah they're pretty much unified

2041.12 --> 2045.36
a lot of the technocracy is grounded in

2043.36 --> 2050.96
media

2045.36 --> 2050.96
media politics business big business

2053.2 --> 2061.839
so they are attempting a new a new

2056.8 --> 2061.8390000000004
neo-feudal nobility class

2063.52 --> 2066.56
right that's going on

2067.04 --> 2073.599
it's not just a country it's everywhere

2070.24 --> 2074.9599999999996
everywhere almost everywhere for almost

2073.599 --> 2077.04
every country

2074.96 --> 2078.0
but at least everywhere in the western

2077.04 --> 2089.839
world

2078.0 --> 2089.839
for sure

2098.64 --> 2117.839
what to receive social benefits

2102.96 --> 2117.839
that's [ __ ]

2128.4 --> 2133.119
well there you go dr gonzo

2134.64 --> 2139.44
you're not exactly building respect on

2137.28 --> 2145.8390000000004
my part by saying such things

2139.44 --> 2145.839
you really don't

2161.44 --> 2165.599
hey absolute flattered vodka good see

2166.41 --> 2169.6299999999997
[Music]

2170.839 --> 2173.839
you

2185.92 --> 2193.92
what do you do in these times well

2189.359 --> 2193.92
you get real with what is real

2194.079 --> 2198.6400000000003
you know you want to live or you want to

2198.88 --> 2202.8
like actually physically live and

2201.119 --> 2204.4
survive

2202.8 --> 2205.8390000000004
well then you got to take on some

2204.4 --> 2208.56
challenges

2205.839 --> 2210.64
now if you're like oh i'm old i got my

2208.56 --> 2213.44
kids it doesn't really matter i don't

2210.64 --> 2213.839
need they don't need my support i have

2213.44 --> 2217.359
am not

2213.839 --> 2219.52
essential for anybody and i just want to

2217.359 --> 2221.7599999999998
enjoy and imagine the world is still

2219.52 --> 2223.04
okay well yeah then take your vaccines

2221.76 --> 2224.96
for sure and then

2223.04 --> 2228.48
at some point you're just gonna get a

2224.96 --> 2231.599
disorder or die

2228.48 --> 2234.079
right if that's if that's how you want

2231.599 --> 2235.76
to do it

2234.079 --> 2237.52
you know but there's going to be a lot

2235.76 --> 2242.5600000000004
of people out there in the world that

2237.52 --> 2243.8
are going to need support so if you're

2242.56 --> 2247.7599999999998
just going to be

2243.8 --> 2250.4
semi-suicidal like that and just give up

2247.76 --> 2251.92
well you're taking away the mental

2250.4 --> 2255.6800000000003
support that they

2251.92 --> 2258.2400000000002
might need right so think about it

2255.68 --> 2258.24
carefully

2262.079 --> 2266.0
all right that world has never been okay

2265.2 --> 2269.1189999999997
you never will

2266.0 --> 2272.48
yeah well if you keep walking away

2269.119 --> 2274.88
then you you ensure that it is never

2272.48 --> 2277.359
going to be okay and never will

2274.88 --> 2279.599
because that is based on people that do

2277.359 --> 2279.5989999999997
that

2280.96 --> 2288.64
you know if you just give up

2285.599 --> 2299.839
then it's going to be like that that's

2288.64 --> 2299.839
part of the problem

2300.72 --> 2304.0789999999997
what are you the better this layout is

2302.88 --> 2306.88
better

2304.079 --> 2307.28
than the running forest okay point each

2306.88 --> 2311.04
well

2307.28 --> 2313.52
it for myself it is kind of good to uh

2311.04 --> 2315.68
to have the old format back without all

2313.52 --> 2317.839
the moving things

2315.68 --> 2319.04
so for me it's almost like nostalgic

2317.839 --> 2322.4
like hey i got it

2319.04 --> 2323.839
my old format back and it's kind of

2322.4 --> 2327.04
growing on me already

2323.839 --> 2330.0789999999997
but there are some potential changes

2327.04 --> 2332.88
planned adam meekin has

2330.079 --> 2335.92
shown me some really really awesome

2332.88 --> 2338.88
background imagery

2335.92 --> 2338.88
so at some point

2338.96 --> 2342.48
i might turn it around again

2344.0 --> 2350.48
but for now yeah this interface is fine

2348.88 --> 2352.32
just got the problem with the sound

2350.48 --> 2355.44
though i don't know how to get it

2352.32 --> 2358.56
symmetrical again

2355.44 --> 2358.56
that's kind of annoying

2358.96 --> 2363.68
i still don't understand why you can't

2361.44 --> 2363.68
just

2365.92 --> 2370.88
so ridiculous why did they take that

2369.68 --> 2373.68
option away

2370.88 --> 2373.6800000000003
so stupid

2375.52 --> 2378.88
the left right slider i don't understand

2377.76 --> 2383.8390000000004
why they took that away

2378.88 --> 2383.839
i just don't anyway

2395.76 --> 2401.0400000000004
okay well dr gonzo please you know if

2398.72 --> 2404.8799999999997
you're going to be

2401.04 --> 2407.599
a surrenderist then i don't really need

2404.88 --> 2407.599
to know about it

2407.76 --> 2412.3190000000004
no that's going to be your problem then

2422.56 --> 2429.2799999999997
because yeah you can't change the world

2425.92 --> 2432.319
by going along with evil

2429.28 --> 2434.96
that's right and

2432.319 --> 2436.88
hey doing something to yourself which

2434.96 --> 2440.56
you're not which you know

2436.88 --> 2444.4
is going to be very likely destructive

2440.56 --> 2446.319
that is evil going along with evil

2444.4 --> 2448.2400000000002
right so doing that is not going to help

2446.319 --> 2453.839
it it's not going to make the world a

2448.24 --> 2453.839
better place

2461.89 --> 2467.839
[Music]

2464.839 --> 2467.839
ah

2480.88 --> 2485.04
hmm that's a good one michael work

2483.04 --> 2486.8
that's from the old block

2485.04 --> 2490.0
those that will not stand for something

2486.8 --> 2490.0
will fall for anything

2492.839 --> 2509.839
right

2495.119 --> 2509.839
hello aaron armstrong

2520.839 --> 2523.839
ah

2537.44 --> 2544.0
t-shirt weather already yeah pretty much

2541.2 --> 2545.2799999999997
although i wouldn't go out like for

2544.0 --> 2548.839
groceries or something

2545.28 --> 2550.0
in my t-shirt because it's it's not that

2548.839 --> 2553.119
warm

2550.0 --> 2556.64
but it is warm enough

2553.119 --> 2556.6400000000003
to be able to yeah enjoy

2557.52 --> 2563.359
just only wearing a t-shirt in here

2561.2 --> 2564.72
there's no moving air around me to cool

2563.359 --> 2567.7599999999998
me off

2564.72 --> 2572.0
and there's plenty of sun so

2567.76 --> 2572.0
and i i like wearing a white t-shirt on

2576.839 --> 2581.359
shows

2579.52 --> 2583.28
yeah michael work just at home

2581.359 --> 2585.839
distraction

2583.28 --> 2587.76
because i i just kind of held his feet

2585.839 --> 2593.839
over the fire about something that's

2587.76 --> 2593.8390000000004
kind of personal so don't blame him

2595.359 --> 2601.2
why did holland change its name to the

2598.48 --> 2601.2
netherlands

2601.44 --> 2605.839
it was never holland all it is just a

2604.56 --> 2609.52
specific

2605.839 --> 2610.24
provincial region north and south

2609.52 --> 2612.96
holland

2610.24 --> 2615.1189999999997
and that was kind of originally the

2612.96 --> 2617.76
netherlands

2615.119 --> 2618.56
it is still well especially south

2617.76 --> 2622.88
holland is

2618.56 --> 2622.88
like very densely populated on average

2626.079 --> 2633.52
but the netherlands basically is are the

2629.76 --> 2635.0800000000004
the provinces the united

2633.52 --> 2642.399
provinces

2635.08 --> 2642.399
[Music]

2643.2 --> 2646.48
and north and south holland are

2645.359 --> 2649.839
provinces

2646.48 --> 2649.839
of the netherlands

2665.8 --> 2668.929
[Music]

2678.72 --> 2683.68
yeah voynich well it's that you're

2681.92 --> 2686.16
like for you're in the netherlands too

2683.68 --> 2688.24
right or very close

2686.16 --> 2690.56
but yeah in a way it's really like a

2688.24 --> 2692.56
spring break moment

2690.56 --> 2693.839
a spring break transition that we

2692.56 --> 2697.2
experienced

2693.839 --> 2699.52
from pretty heavy freezing and snow

2697.2 --> 2705.839
to suddenly it melting getting mild and

2699.52 --> 2705.839
then really getting nice

2712.0 --> 2715.839
oh yeah right vintage

2716.319 --> 2733.839
i know that oh well i i wasn't fully

2719.2 --> 2733.839
aware of that

2744.839 --> 2747.839
hmm

2754.56 --> 2761.839
holland was the seven prince provinces

2758.839 --> 2765.92
combined

2761.839 --> 2768.16
that's it okay well

2765.92 --> 2768.96
if there was some kind of specific name

2768.16 --> 2772.319
transition

2768.96 --> 2774.64
from holland to the netherlands

2772.319 --> 2789.839
i don't know when exactly that happened

2774.64 --> 2789.839
and why

2815.839 --> 2820.24
all right oh man i'm looking forward to

2822.73 --> 2826.929
[Music]

2828.839 --> 2834.719
lunch

2831.33 --> 2834.719
[Music]

2842.839 --> 2845.839
so

2856.16 --> 2864.0
uh no aaron

2859.839 --> 2868.5589999999997
no i'm i'm i've been drinking

2864.0 --> 2870.839
pretty much the same that was since

2868.559 --> 2873.8390000000004
i think yeah since the beginning of the

2870.839 --> 2873.839
year

2879.359 --> 2884.24
but it was good to have a persistent

2884.839 --> 2887.839
break

2888.079 --> 2894.48
yes right yeah i did i got

2891.52 --> 2897.92
really enthusiastic and if that ever

2894.48 --> 2901.28
happens again i'll just shut the [ __ ] up

2897.92 --> 2901.839
it was really stupid but it i was just

2901.28 --> 2905.599
so

2901.839 --> 2909.7599999999998
full of full of spirit then

2905.599 --> 2912.8
it just shoots out it's like it's mania

2909.76 --> 2916.7200000000003
like i had a really a manic episode

2912.8 --> 2918.96
after i got better from being that sick

2916.72 --> 2920.48
it just means that you're just really

2918.96 --> 2924.319
pushy

2920.48 --> 2925.92
to everything so you just make like yeah

2924.319 --> 2928.16
i'm going to do this

2925.92 --> 2930.16
totally not thinking about how things

2928.16 --> 2932.0789999999997
actually work it's just that your will

2930.16 --> 2935.2799999999997
is so overpowering

2932.079 --> 2936.96
in that moment that i make those

2935.28 --> 2938.4
statements

2936.96 --> 2940.96
because in that moment i really hope

2938.4 --> 2945.119
that i can but then eventually

2940.96 --> 2945.119
things return back to normal

2946.72 --> 2951.68
so i i don't know if i'll ever

2949.04 --> 2954.839
permanently stop drinking

2951.68 --> 2957.839
it's not that bad of an influence on

2954.839 --> 2957.839
average

2965.52 --> 2971.839
you think you were mad i know i was

2974.0 --> 2978.64
i had so much sensation of strength and

2976.8 --> 2982.2400000000002
confidence

2978.64 --> 2987.1189999999997
like it's like this thing it awoke in me

2982.24 --> 2987.1189999999997
after i got better really strong

2990.16 --> 2999.839
okay aaron good and you

3008.559 --> 3013.8390000000004
all right

3014.0 --> 3020.4
right well i'm i get it

3017.599 --> 3020.7200000000003
that some people just can't do it ever

3020.4 --> 3024.079
and

3020.72 --> 3024.8799999999997
it might be killing you with me not so

3024.079 --> 3029.04
much

3024.88 --> 3031.92
i just have this persistent limit

3029.04 --> 3032.72
and it's still bringing me some good

3031.92 --> 3035.599
times in

3032.72 --> 3037.839
in certain moments in the day it poses

3035.599 --> 3041.599
some kind of a relief

3037.839 --> 3044.72
of basically not like

3041.599 --> 3047.2000000000003
like relinquishing the pressure

3044.72 --> 3048.9599999999996
on the mental level for a certain moment

3047.2 --> 3049.7599999999998
where it just doesn't really matter as

3048.96 --> 3052.079
much

3049.76 --> 3054.2400000000002
because to me everything always matters

3052.079 --> 3056.1600000000003
it's really annoying

3054.24 --> 3058.3999999999996
to be like that it's always been like

3056.16 --> 3058.3999999999996
that

3066.839 --> 3069.839
and

3071.599 --> 3074.8
yeah i just got it under control never

3074.48 --> 3078.559
it

3074.8 --> 3078.559
never really was out of control

3079.68 --> 3084.7999999999997
but on the long run it does have an

3082.16 --> 3088.319
influence on my mood and everything

3084.8 --> 3091.599
so if i for example get

3088.319 --> 3093.2799999999997
further develop my life what i'm doing

3091.599 --> 3097.599
then at some point i might consider like

3093.28 --> 3100.96
okay maybe it's getting in the way now

3097.599 --> 3103.52
right but at this moment no it's all

3100.96 --> 3107.2
just fine

3103.52 --> 3107.2
it's not costing me too much

3107.599 --> 3111.839
physical or financially

3122.48 --> 3129.2
yes aaron armstrong yes that happened

3126.0 --> 3129.2
two years ago i know

3129.52 --> 3135.04
and i don't remember who it was but

3131.599 --> 3135.04
somebody actually completely

3135.68 --> 3139.839
is it amber reimbursed

3140.24 --> 3144.8799999999997
the entire amount for me which was a

3143.04 --> 3146.8
huge help

3144.88 --> 3150.839
because it was really at a time where i

3146.8 --> 3153.8390000000004
was not not doing all that great

3150.839 --> 3153.839
financially

3155.839 --> 3167.839
it hasn't happened since

3181.2 --> 3195.839
i know i remember that aaron

3204.72 --> 3212.5589999999997
thanks alright yeah dr gonzo

3209.839 --> 3212.5589999999997
don't do that

3213.28 --> 3223.8390000000004
just don't

3225.52 --> 3237.839
might have been sarcasm or whatever but

3229.119 --> 3237.839
you just shouldn't say such things

3248.839 --> 3251.839
so

3259.04 --> 3265.359
right so hey anybody wants to talk about

3261.68 --> 3269.04
cosmogeny or

3265.359 --> 3269.04
have you all learned your lesson

3269.2 --> 3276.3999999999996
but the housekeeping questions now

3272.88 --> 3277.44
you finally get it and you realize that

3276.4 --> 3279.92
from within

3277.44 --> 3282.079
your own presuppositional model every

3279.92 --> 3284.88
step of the way

3282.079 --> 3286.96
like the setup doesn't even abide by

3284.88 --> 3293.839
your own rules

3286.96 --> 3293.839
of functioning is that sinking in yet

3297.68 --> 3303.44
it's all just fake is it dan sebastian

3300.72 --> 3303.4399999999996
it's all fake

3304.48 --> 3308.16
yeah that that's what happens you know

3306.48 --> 3310.88
when when you bump into something

3308.16 --> 3312.96
you don't want to know because it hurts

3310.88 --> 3315.599
then everything is fake yeah i

3312.96 --> 3316.2400000000002
remember that response it's very human

3315.599 --> 3317.76
inherent

3316.24 --> 3320.319
to have that response i had that

3317.76 --> 3321.599
response quite a few times it's like

3320.319 --> 3323.92
what

3321.599 --> 3324.7200000000003
i i'm not accepting this the world can't

3323.92 --> 3328.079
be like this

3324.72 --> 3331.2
if this is true then i'm just not

3328.079 --> 3333.52
then i don't want to know anymore

3331.2 --> 3335.359
yeah i'd be more a little bit more

3333.52 --> 3336.88
direct like that

3335.359 --> 3340.16
i had a lot of those responses

3336.88 --> 3340.1600000000003
especially in my teens

3342.4 --> 3347.839
make me feel very silly afterward

3345.839 --> 3351.52
but that's just how it works right

3347.839 --> 3356.4
because that's what you do in your teens

3351.52 --> 3358.319
not after your 20s in your 30s 40s 50s

3356.4 --> 3363.2000000000003
right that's not when you're supposed to

3358.319 --> 3366.72
be doing that anymore

3363.2 --> 3366.72
because that makes you kind of into a

3374.839 --> 3377.839
dumbass

3385.44 --> 3391.839
yeah share your pain then sebastian

3397.599 --> 3405.599
yeah dr ganzo i know ignorance is bliss

3401.68 --> 3407.52
until you die because that usually comes

3405.599 --> 3410.559
forth from that as well oh

3407.52 --> 3414.4
they don't include that in that saying

3410.559 --> 3418.4
do they too bad

3414.4 --> 3422.559
because it's there

3418.4 --> 3422.559
because ignorance does get you killed

3430.839 --> 3433.839
eventually

3434.0 --> 3437.04
you still want to see the bloody ice

3435.68 --> 3439.9199999999996
fall go

3437.04 --> 3442.88
and watch go go then go and see the

3439.92 --> 3442.88
bloody ice wall then

3444.48 --> 3448.2400000000002
we all die yeah

3448.64 --> 3452.48
well with dying i mean not from natural

3451.44 --> 3456.88
causes

3452.48 --> 3460.96
or it might seem like that but basically

3456.88 --> 3464.6400000000003
dramatically shortening the lifespan

3460.96 --> 3464.64
yeah that's sort of dying

3464.88 --> 3468.0
don't be as smart as

3471.68 --> 3479.2
right and also hey that might include

3475.44 --> 3481.52
taking others with you

3479.2 --> 3481.52
you know

3482.799 --> 3488.799
people that die unexpectedly often

3486.0 --> 3491.119
still live with people counting on them

3488.799 --> 3494.24
and all that [ __ ] and then suddenly oh

3491.119 --> 3498.7200000000003
yeah because of their ignorance

3494.24 --> 3500.4799999999996
they suddenly drop out right they die

3498.72 --> 3502.8799999999997
and then yeah they leave that gap and

3500.48 --> 3503.28
then suddenly yeah suddenly you created

3502.88 --> 3507.2000000000003
this

3503.28 --> 3516.2400000000002
vacuum so

3507.2 --> 3518.24
that's all okay with you

3516.24 --> 3519.5989999999997
nothing would work so it's somebody's

3518.24 --> 3524.72
triggered today

3519.599 --> 3524.7200000000003
dan sebastian is so triggered

3525.76 --> 3531.8390000000004
i haven't even really addressed you

3534.64 --> 3538.16
oh my rage my rage against corporations

3537.839 --> 3542.0
my

3538.16 --> 3544.24
rage i have so much rage against

3542.0 --> 3546.16
corporations i can't stop screaming

3544.24 --> 3549.839
about it

3546.16 --> 3559.839
and now it's boring and

3549.839 --> 3559.839
wow did you just get your period

3565.839 --> 3573.839
because you sound like it

3578.88 --> 3583.04
oh yeah yeah oh yeah i have a lot of

3582.0 --> 3584.96
criticism on

3583.04 --> 3586.64
certain corporations especially when

3584.96 --> 3590.799
they start

3586.64 --> 3594.0
i don't know damaging their own

3590.799 --> 3597.119
products you know yeah that's

3594.0 --> 3602.16
that gets me very frustrated

3597.119 --> 3602.1600000000003
when products for no reason degenerate

3602.319 --> 3607.04
functions are taken away for example

3604.88 --> 3608.96
like being able to go to somebody's

3607.04 --> 3610.72
youtube channel by clicking on the three

3608.96 --> 3612.7200000000003
dots in chat

3610.72 --> 3614.48
for no reason yeah that that can get me

3612.72 --> 3617.839
kind of pissed off

3614.48 --> 3621.68
i'm so sorry i'm so sorry that i

3617.839 --> 3624.319
don't always speak with a calm voice

3621.68 --> 3624.8799999999997
all right like you're a nice little

3624.319 --> 3629.04
animal

3624.88 --> 3631.04
it just has to be killed to be butchered

3629.04 --> 3632.799
so i'm gonna be very nice talking and

3631.04 --> 3636.88
never get angry

3632.799 --> 3640.48
so you can calmly calmly be guided

3636.88 --> 3642.96
to your ignorant grave yeah

3640.48 --> 3644.16
is that good for you a little less

3642.96 --> 3648.16
triggered now

3644.16 --> 3651.52
than sebastian hm

3648.16 --> 3657.839
that matter if it's just very very calm

3651.52 --> 3660.0
everything's okay don't worry

3657.839 --> 3662.0789999999997
you still have so much time just don't

3660.0 --> 3666.16
think about it

3662.079 --> 3670.6400000000003
you know it's okay

3666.16 --> 3673.7599999999998
just do everything they tell you to do

3670.64 --> 3673.7599999999998
everything will be okay

3674.64 --> 3679.2799999999997
you're feeling better now than sebastian

3680.4 --> 3685.839
yeah okay find some peace now

3708.559 --> 3713.599
i think he's back to sleep i think

3711.599 --> 3715.44
i think baby just woke up in the night

3713.599 --> 3716.4
and started like immediately went

3715.44 --> 3719.599
through the chat and

3716.4 --> 3723.039
was like yes i just had to

3719.599 --> 3727.839
calmly address just

3723.039 --> 3727.8390000000004
go back to sleep baby it's okay

3727.92 --> 3730.48
it's okay

3734.319 --> 3741.839
and work so it's back to sleep okay so

3736.48 --> 3741.839
let's get back to the show

3745.96 --> 3749.059
[Music]

3752.839 --> 3769.839
ah

3755.52 --> 3769.839
oh seeking star wars what are you eating

3775.62 --> 3778.73
[Music]

3785.839 --> 3788.88
all right i'll find each you know on

3788.319 --> 3792.0
average

3788.88 --> 3796.4
i i can i think i can safely

3792.0 --> 3800.24
state that people that are very

3796.4 --> 3803.76
triggered a lot of the time are often

3800.24 --> 3808.24
just very much in need of some kind of

3803.76 --> 3811.599
social interaction of a specific sort

3808.24 --> 3814.9599999999996
like more meaningful communication

3811.599 --> 3818.6400000000003
like for example like brothers like

3814.96 --> 3820.079
sibling talk close or if you have that

3818.64 --> 3823.1189999999997
or a parent

3820.079 --> 3825.039
consoling you right people need that and

3823.119 --> 3828.079
if they don't get it

3825.039 --> 3831.28
and they're like too

3828.079 --> 3834.319
proud to recognize it

3831.28 --> 3835.44
that they don't have that option to

3834.319 --> 3838.319
basically

3835.44 --> 3838.96
do that thing to calm down as a human

3838.319 --> 3841.44
being

3838.96 --> 3843.44
then they will get very easily triggered

3841.44 --> 3846.0
and they will start attacking people

3843.44 --> 3847.119
it's almost like why aren't you being

3846.0 --> 3851.2
nice

3847.119 --> 3854.48
why aren't you this and that and that

3851.2 --> 3856.0
kind of like a baby that's woken up in

3854.48 --> 3860.0
the middle of the night

3856.0 --> 3862.079
got a little cramping because they need

3860.0 --> 3863.359
that very specific attention of the

3862.079 --> 3867.599
parent they'll do

3863.359 --> 3870.0789999999997
anything and accept everything

3867.599 --> 3870.6400000000003
just just to help them out in that

3870.079 --> 3874.1600000000003
moment

3870.64 --> 3876.799
right so that a lot of people in chat

3874.16 --> 3878.72
not specifically my chat alone right

3876.799 --> 3881.839
this is very universal

3878.72 --> 3883.68
people on the internet too that are very

3881.839 --> 3886.0789999999997
getting in your face and triggered

3883.68 --> 3889.2
easily it's often people that have

3886.079 --> 3892.1600000000003
just lacked

3889.2 --> 3894.24
social attention or good parenting it

3892.16 --> 3898.0789999999997
really comes to that

3894.24 --> 3900.8799999999997
so if you can just kind of know that

3898.079 --> 3903.039
and give them exactly what they need

3900.88 --> 3906.079
even if they don't understand

3903.039 --> 3908.4
then you'll find they'll be very

3906.079 --> 3909.76
malleable to certainly turn around and

3908.4 --> 3913.039
be very nice

3909.76 --> 3915.599
it is possible i've already tested this

3913.039 --> 3919.28
concept

3915.599 --> 3922.0
in my chat but

3919.28 --> 3924.2400000000002
it's not very nice to feel like you're

3922.0 --> 3924.799
being identified for a weakness you

3924.24 --> 3927.5989999999997
possess

3924.799 --> 3928.72
though so there may still be people in

3927.599 --> 3930.88
chat that get

3928.72 --> 3932.3999999999996
triggered and just immediately say it's

3930.88 --> 3937.839
all nonsense

3932.4 --> 3937.839
like and again here in chat it happens

3944.559 --> 3948.6400000000003
right but most trolls that are very

3947.28 --> 3950.799
easily triggered

3948.64 --> 3952.8799999999997
basically it comes down to they've

3950.799 --> 3956.64
lacked

3952.88 --> 3961.359
personal attention in their life

3956.64 --> 3964.799
so they try to steal that attention

3961.359 --> 3968.5589999999997
through trolling that's really real

3964.799 --> 3972.24
that's i yeah i dare to state

3968.559 --> 3974.559
that it's like my my psychology layman's

3972.24 --> 3977.52
study conclusion

3974.559 --> 3977.52
that that's a thing

3977.599 --> 3982.319
and i'm very confident about it i can

3980.48 --> 3985.44
even testify it

3982.319 --> 3988.799
from myself because i

3985.44 --> 3990.64
as you all know have lived in periods of

3988.799 --> 3993.359
isolation

3990.64 --> 3994.72
and then guess what happens you lack

3993.359 --> 3997.92
getting the attention

3994.72 --> 4000.64
you get stressed out

3997.92 --> 4001.6800000000003
and you may get in people's way one way

4000.64 --> 4004.24
or the other

4001.68 --> 4006.0789999999997
might it be by being extremely noisy and

4004.24 --> 4008.8799999999997
then making people worried

4006.079 --> 4010.559
or by just getting really like oh i want

4008.88 --> 4014.799
to get at something and just

4010.559 --> 4018.1600000000003
jump on it and totally

4014.799 --> 4018.16
be merciless and all that

4018.72 --> 4024.24
if you have more people having

4021.92 --> 4026.559
good social interaction and deeper

4024.24 --> 4027.359
meaningful social interaction with more

4026.559 --> 4029.92
people

4027.359 --> 4030.96
you have less of this pushiness less of

4029.92 --> 4034.16
this tension

4030.96 --> 4038.559
built up that makes you go

4034.16 --> 4038.5589999999997
and do that that's a fact

4042.079 --> 4047.52
and if you remember this

4045.119 --> 4049.599
then i promise you it and maybe in a

4047.52 --> 4050.48
year time a couple of years you'll get

4049.599 --> 4053.119
back to me

4050.48 --> 4053.68
and tell me like holy [ __ ] dude that's

4053.119 --> 4058.4
freaking

4053.68 --> 4061.7599999999998
exactly how it works because it does

4058.4 --> 4063.839
got a lifetime of experience to back it

4061.76 --> 4063.8390000000004
up

4066.86 --> 4070.969
[Music]

4074.839 --> 4077.839
with

4082.319 --> 4088.48
just like how gravity works what

4086.319 --> 4088.48
no

4089.599 --> 4094.079
now gravity suppose is basically a

4092.0 --> 4097.359
mathematical pattern within

4094.079 --> 4100.88
physical mechanics that is not actual

4097.359 --> 4103.120000000001
what effectively works for

4100.88 --> 4104.64
the process of design and all that

4103.12 --> 4108.08
measuring up

4104.64 --> 4111.12
it's not real what i described that's

4108.08 --> 4119.359
actual spirit mechanics that's

4111.12 --> 4120.719
just what it means to be a human being

4119.359 --> 4122.4800000000005
it's not conceptual it's not a

4120.719 --> 4124.159
mathematical pattern that's being

4122.48 --> 4127.199
reified that's just

4124.159 --> 4129.92
the things that happen every time like

4127.199 --> 4133.839
if you apply it if you test it

4129.92 --> 4133.839
it'll work

4135.12 --> 4140.48
well timed and in on place

4139.04 --> 4142.88
you know you can be out of place

4140.48 --> 4145.44
sometimes well timed and on place

4142.88 --> 4146.159000000001
personal attention if you can muster it

4145.44 --> 4149.3589999999995
somehow

4146.159 --> 4151.12
if god allows it you could say if it

4149.359 --> 4151.6
just comes to you that you can do that

4151.12 --> 4155.44
and you

4151.6 --> 4158.88
have the energy and the focus it solves

4155.44 --> 4161.5199999999995
a lot of stress

4158.88 --> 4162.159000000001
situations just some good personal

4161.52 --> 4164.2390000000005
attention

4162.159 --> 4165.2789999999995
if you can find that way through if

4164.239 --> 4168.0
however you

4165.279 --> 4168.88
get offended and triggered from your own

4168.0 --> 4172.48
side

4168.88 --> 4174.319
then this blockade mentally forms

4172.48 --> 4175.839
and then you won't find that moment to

4174.319 --> 4179.04
get to the other person because

4175.839 --> 4182.0
you've gotten defensive right

4179.04 --> 4183.6
because hey if multiple people have a

4182.0 --> 4185.839
lot of stress built up

4183.6 --> 4187.759
not really have found a way to properly

4185.839 --> 4190.96
socially communicate

4187.759 --> 4192.56
then if one gets triggered

4190.96 --> 4194.56
then the other might get triggered back

4192.56 --> 4196.88
and you get a trigger war

4194.56 --> 4199.120000000001
right never ends until somebody gets

4196.88 --> 4202.159000000001
exhausted

4199.12 --> 4205.599999999999
now a lot of people

4202.159 --> 4208.159
by now in the last 20 years

4205.6 --> 4208.719
have experienced this at least once in

4208.159 --> 4211.92
their life

4208.719 --> 4211.92
on the internet somewhere

4213.36 --> 4220.32
it happens to everybody at least once

4217.44 --> 4220.32
get caught up

4221.92 --> 4225.1990000000005
you feel kind of stressed out a little

4223.92 --> 4227.28
tense

4225.199 --> 4228.719
you get caught up in something and then

4227.28 --> 4230.719
certainly it's just

4228.719 --> 4233.12
the they call it they have it given a

4230.719 --> 4235.36
name it's called flame wars

4233.12 --> 4237.36
they gave it a name long time ago it's

4235.36 --> 4241.599999999999
not a new name it's very old

4237.36 --> 4244.639999999999
right that's how it works

4241.6 --> 4248.4800000000005
personal tension builds up

4244.64 --> 4252.159000000001
because of the lack of good

4248.48 --> 4254.08
meaningful deeper personal and spiritual

4252.159 --> 4257.599999999999
communication that doesn't mean oh

4254.08 --> 4258.4
an act a good stimulating act now that

4257.6 --> 4261.280000000001
means

4258.4 --> 4262.639999999999
direct spirit to spirit communication

4261.28 --> 4265.28
and the recognition

4262.64 --> 4266.56
of all things like oh you have feelings

4265.28 --> 4268.8
you feel this about

4266.56 --> 4270.080000000001
yourself or about others you have a

4268.8 --> 4272.2390000000005
conflict with this

4270.08 --> 4275.76
in your the real spiritual issues if

4272.239 --> 4279.28
there's no meaningful communication

4275.76 --> 4282.400000000001
i'd say on a regular basis then tension

4279.28 --> 4282.719
will eventually build up causing you to

4282.4 --> 4285.92
get

4282.719 --> 4288.88
easily triggered and then basically try

4285.92 --> 4291.28
to steal that attention which is a

4288.88 --> 4292.64
futile process you can you can't really

4291.28 --> 4297.28
steal it

4292.64 --> 4299.52
you can't satisfy that need in that way

4297.28 --> 4301.679
but a lot of people still do it

4299.52 --> 4303.72
impulsively

4301.679 --> 4306.909
anyway

4303.72 --> 4306.909000000001

4312.0 --> 4316.48
colin jolie i'm so tricky i'm always so

4315.36 --> 4320.719
triggered

4316.48 --> 4322.879999999999
man i'm guys i'm so triggered right now

4320.719 --> 4328.56
it's unbelievable just going out of my

4322.88 --> 4330.8
mind with stress and just

4328.56 --> 4330.8
no

4333.679 --> 4337.6
i think some people are just kind of

4336.48 --> 4343.28
getting triggered and

4337.6 --> 4346.2390000000005
projecting but that's fine

4343.28 --> 4349.12
you don't have to accept that i'm

4346.239 --> 4353.36
fundamentally correct about something

4349.12 --> 4356.32
because i also claim the same thing

4353.36 --> 4357.5199999999995
about a certain cosmogeny and that goes

4356.32 --> 4360.32
against your dream

4357.52 --> 4362.64
right you don't have to accept what i'm

4360.32 --> 4362.639999999999
saying

4363.12 --> 4369.12
right but if you just listen

4367.199 --> 4370.48
don't discard it right away just think

4369.12 --> 4372.5599999999995
about it carefully and

4370.48 --> 4376.08
maybe deep personified right it doesn't

4372.56 --> 4376.080000000001
have to be about irwin here

4376.239 --> 4380.718999999999
just you could probably figure out other

4378.32 --> 4384.639999999999
people that deal with these things

4380.719 --> 4388.0
and this mechanic just think about it

4384.64 --> 4389.6
then eventually you can see doesn't have

4388.0 --> 4394.48
to involve our win at all

4389.6 --> 4394.4800000000005
you can see that it works like that

4394.96 --> 4400.08
and everybody is in it

4401.6 --> 4405.6
and funnily enough eventually you can

4403.679 --> 4409.76
even develop like this

4405.6 --> 4414.320000000001
gauge this this ah

4409.76 --> 4414.320000000001
yeah what do you call that cena gage

4414.56 --> 4418.4800000000005
like this

4418.96 --> 4422.32
a meter that you can just size up like

4421.84 --> 4427.360000000001
oh

4422.32 --> 4430.0
this much of this type of tension

4427.36 --> 4433.199
this person is probably been socially

4430.0 --> 4436.32
isolated for this amount

4433.199 --> 4438.719
right you

4436.32 --> 4440.719
i've developed this i think a lot of

4438.719 --> 4443.04
people on the internet

4440.719 --> 4444.0
that are like youtubers and stuff do

4443.04 --> 4446.719
develop this

4444.0 --> 4447.6
because they're constantly dealing with

4446.719 --> 4449.92
people

4447.6 --> 4451.679
that have different levels of stress and

4449.92 --> 4452.4
the way they respond because of it and

4451.679 --> 4454.8
eventually

4452.4 --> 4456.239
you just see it because if you never see

4454.8 --> 4459.679
it

4456.239 --> 4462.0
then it will always outsmart you

4459.679 --> 4464.159
then people will always troll you in

4462.0 --> 4466.88
ways that you can't deal with it

4464.159 --> 4469.5199999999995
so you're kind of forced to spiritually

4466.88 --> 4470.96
learn to size it up

4469.52 --> 4473.360000000001
one way or the other but it might be

4470.96 --> 4476.2390000000005
completely self-conscious you never have

4473.36 --> 4477.04
would have to have a single conscious

4476.239 --> 4479.36
thought

4477.04 --> 4480.32
spent on it on the structure of it

4479.36 --> 4483.839999999999
you'll just

4480.32 --> 4483.84
start to sense it

4499.04 --> 4511.84
doctor gunzo don't get pervy please

4515.44 --> 4525.839999999999
and cole and jolly don't care about your

4518.64 --> 4525.84
sexual orientation

4564.84 --> 4570.64
what

4566.159 --> 4570.639999999999
i couldn't approve that message what

4572.96 --> 4581.84
that was weird

4582.88 --> 4586.079
[Music]

4601.36 --> 4603.679
all right

4605.76 --> 4612.159000000001
mars is flat well

4609.28 --> 4612.96
i've heard mars is just devon island i

4612.159 --> 4616.159
don't know

4612.96 --> 4616.719
how reliable that is though but i've

4616.159 --> 4620.48
heard

4616.719 --> 4623.84
that being said so what do you guys

4620.48 --> 4623.839999999999
think is it devon island

4632.4 --> 4636.4
if it is then it would explain a few

4635.199 --> 4639.199
things also

4636.4 --> 4640.96
why the supposed mars landing footage

4639.199 --> 4644.159
did not show

4640.96 --> 4651.84
the horizon at any point because that

4644.159 --> 4651.839999999999
would have probably revealed too much

4662.84 --> 4665.84
now

4668.48 --> 4676.4
what they 100 use it to test

4672.0 --> 4681.92
the rover like officially

4676.4 --> 4683.599999999999
like they say they are basically

4681.92 --> 4684.96
testing it there so they're like

4683.6 --> 4688.719
emulating

4684.96 --> 4691.84
a mars landing and then once they've

4688.719 --> 4694.4800000000005
emulated it they basically do the shot

4691.84 --> 4694.4800000000005
for real

4696.32 --> 4700.5599999999995
and then just claim it was on mars it

4698.8 --> 4702.88
could be

4700.56 --> 4707.84
it's very systematic of them if that if

4702.88 --> 4707.84
they've done that

4733.52 --> 4735.84
okay

4760.84 --> 4763.84
hmm

4766.159 --> 4770.4
oh rocket man it's not that strange that

4768.32 --> 4774.639999999999
it's only now being talked about because

4770.4 --> 4777.28
now there's supposedly a moon or a

4774.64 --> 4779.04
mars landing so yeah duh if that's

4777.28 --> 4780.48
officially being rolled out to be

4779.04 --> 4784.96
happening yeah of course

4780.48 --> 4784.959999999999
now people are looking it up what do you

4788.84 --> 4791.84
expect

4793.92 --> 4797.92
hello milo philip what thanks for

4796.159 --> 4802.4
helping me prove my point yes

4797.92 --> 4802.4
i don't know what point that is but okay

4802.84 --> 4805.84
sure

4817.28 --> 4819.84
hmm

4846.8 --> 4851.4400000000005
hello fellain buchanan good afternoon

4852.88 --> 4858.159000000001
no tiny one mo we're not saying system

4855.84 --> 4860.2390000000005
shouldn't be tested first

4858.159 --> 4862.5599999999995
but the whole situation does kind of

4860.239 --> 4862.5599999999995
smell

4864.56 --> 4870.88
like well covert operations false flag

4868.8 --> 4874.08
operations and such where

4870.88 --> 4875.52
i don't know police for example do a

4874.08 --> 4878.239
training

4875.52 --> 4880.0
of say a terrorist like what if a

4878.239 --> 4881.12
terrorist would do something then train

4880.0 --> 4883.76
them right

4881.12 --> 4886.48
and then suddenly it goes live and

4883.76 --> 4886.4800000000005
becomes real

4887.679 --> 4893.28
that sort of thing right oh if you're

4890.96 --> 4894.8
into false flags and how that works and

4893.28 --> 4897.84
crisis acting and all that

4894.8 --> 4900.8
then you know about that at least

4897.84 --> 4901.360000000001
well how difficult is it to figure out

4900.8 --> 4904.0
that

4901.36 --> 4905.839999999999
it's very likely they're doing just that

4904.0 --> 4906.56
like oh we're just testing it's just for

4905.84 --> 4908.719
the testing

4906.56 --> 4910.2390000000005
and then oh yeah then you just put

4908.719 --> 4913.199
cameras on them

4910.239 --> 4914.799999999999
don't say it's just testing decide like

4913.199 --> 4917.678999999999
okay this is the way it's gonna look

4914.8 --> 4919.76
this is now how that region will look

4917.679 --> 4920.96
okay let's keep a record of that in

4919.76 --> 4923.92
secret

4920.96 --> 4925.04
and just yeah as you're supposedly

4923.92 --> 4927.6
testing it

4925.04 --> 4928.08
oh guess what yeah we were just testing

4927.6 --> 4931.04
it

4928.08 --> 4931.5199999999995
oh and here a few years later oh look

4931.04 --> 4935.12
here

4931.52 --> 4938.080000000001
is the footage of the real thing

4935.12 --> 4939.12
well and if they've if you like

4938.08 --> 4940.88
literally

4939.12 --> 4942.32
were in the editing department or

4940.88 --> 4945.12
whatever then you would know

4942.32 --> 4945.44
this is exactly this is that footage

4945.12 --> 4948.239
this

4945.44 --> 4950.159
is the original footage of that test you

4948.239 --> 4952.239
would recognize it

4950.159 --> 4953.199
right so you you'd probably have to be

4952.239 --> 4956.239
in on it

4953.199 --> 4956.239
and keep it a secret

4957.32 --> 4962.08
presupposing no it's just that's an easy

4960.8 --> 4965.6
way to engage inter

4962.08 --> 4973.84
in trickery tiny wumble

4965.6 --> 4973.84
so it's it's not unlikely

4987.52 --> 4991.360000000001
it looks nothing like worse

4992.56 --> 4996.0
well maybe they don't need the entirety

4994.8 --> 4997.92
of mars they just need

4996.0 --> 5000.56
the parts that they are planning to

4997.92 --> 5005.36
actually go

5000.56 --> 5007.04
with whatever yeah the rover that's it

5005.36 --> 5008.4
and the rest they'll just fill in with

5007.04 --> 5012.48
cgi or

5008.4 --> 5012.48
like scale model props

5012.8 --> 5015.84
however they're gonna do it

5018.32 --> 5021.599999999999
uh no doctor gonzo

5021.679 --> 5029.84
no no don't talk to her

5025.12 --> 5029.84
like that it's very simple

5046.719 --> 5052.8
this ridiculous steamy traveler i'm a

5049.28 --> 5052.8
flat earther they wouldn't have me

5055.44 --> 5060.5599999999995
can you imagine me doing being part of

5058.48 --> 5063.28
that they just hang over my shoulder

5060.56 --> 5063.280000000001
constantly

5064.32 --> 5070.08
like they're still like the normies in

5067.199 --> 5072.0
nasa right that really believe it but

5070.08 --> 5073.92
just imagine that they find out i was a

5072.0 --> 5077.36
flat earther and just in there

5073.92 --> 5079.4400000000005
they'd be constantly looking

5077.36 --> 5081.04
at me like what is the flat earther

5079.44 --> 5082.96
doing here this is ridiculous is he

5081.04 --> 5085.84
going to sabotage it no it's never going

5082.96 --> 5085.84
to work

5094.0 --> 5099.84
he's overqualified for nasa

5097.44 --> 5099.839999999999
probably

5124.84 --> 5127.84
hmm

5129.33 --> 5135.239
[Music]

5138.84 --> 5142.719
uh

5140.159 --> 5143.759999999999
aren't they flat earthers oh what's a

5142.719 --> 5145.92
flat earther

5143.76 --> 5146.8
is a flat earth or somebody who believes

5145.92 --> 5150.4
the flat earth

5146.8 --> 5153.6
and then lies of it and then

5150.4 --> 5156.159
abuses therefore knowledge to manipulate

5153.6 --> 5157.84
and extract money from other people is

5156.159 --> 5158.96
that what a flat earther does by

5157.84 --> 5161.84
definition

5158.96 --> 5161.84
i don't think so

5165.28 --> 5169.28
if you know what the lie is and you're

5167.28 --> 5173.199
gonna keep it a secret and then

5169.28 --> 5174.96
abuse it for all kinds of reasons

5173.199 --> 5176.799999999999
then in my eyes you're not a flat

5174.96 --> 5178.719
earther

5176.8 --> 5181.04
just because you know doesn't make you

5178.719 --> 5181.04
one

5181.52 --> 5185.360000000001
if you're not going to be honest about

5182.96 --> 5187.6
it ever right

5185.36 --> 5188.5599999999995
makes you a flat earther is that you're

5187.6 --> 5197.84
honest

5188.56 --> 5197.84
about it

5204.4 --> 5207.679
i don't know larry to march

5209.679 --> 5215.04
move better place how would you know

5212.719 --> 5216.2390000000005
have you ever spent time trying to fake

5215.04 --> 5218.4
mars landings

5216.239 --> 5219.36
how would you know laura demarch you

5218.4 --> 5225.199
freaking think this

5219.36 --> 5227.5199999999995
[ __ ] is real

5225.199 --> 5229.4
this is where are you considering like

5227.52 --> 5232.8
how to fake

5229.4 --> 5235.92
heliocentric priesthood acts

5232.8 --> 5238.96
this is getting kind of weird

5235.92 --> 5242.0
don't forget you believe it's real right

5238.96 --> 5242.56
right larry the march it's real why

5242.0 --> 5247.76
would you

5242.56 --> 5247.76
think about how to fake it it's real

5250.84 --> 5253.84
right

5256.639 --> 5260.719
death valley would be easier would it

5258.48 --> 5260.718999999999
though

5260.96 --> 5267.84
wouldn't it be too recognizable

5295.12 --> 5300.96
in new mexico is it

5298.639 --> 5300.96
okay

5301.679 --> 5306.8
i'm just going off superficial rumors

5304.639 --> 5310.8
you know people that have brought up

5306.8 --> 5310.8
devon island here in my chat

5318.56 --> 5326.719
uh yes vowlan buchanan i have

5322.88 --> 5329.52
i know underground bike parking facility

5326.719 --> 5329.52
it's pretty big

5332.48 --> 5337.839999999999
it's interesting how is laid out i agree

5352.96 --> 5355.199
hmm

5361.28 --> 5367.679
right okay

5364.32 --> 5367.679
so yeah

5369.36 --> 5374.4
there could be a lot of many different

5372.0 --> 5379.04
factors and places they could have been

5374.4 --> 5381.599999999999
made part of the endeavor

5379.04 --> 5382.88
the mars landing who knows where they

5381.6 --> 5386.2390000000005
actually did

5382.88 --> 5388.96
the thing that they ended up using

5386.239 --> 5388.959999999999
for the footage

5391.12 --> 5393.84
i have no idea

5419.76 --> 5421.84
you

5458.08 --> 5462.88
don't encourage the trolls outreach

5474.84 --> 5477.84
don't

5487.12 --> 5491.84
larry the march

5497.36 --> 5500.96
footage of mars is really can prove

5500.0 --> 5502.96
otherwise

5500.96 --> 5504.8
just saying it's fake doesn't mean

5502.96 --> 5506.96
anything yeah yeah that's very easy to

5504.8 --> 5510.719
conclude is fake you see

5506.96 --> 5514.8
it's taking place in a region

5510.719 --> 5518.159
that can't exist in nature

5514.8 --> 5519.1990000000005
it's very easy to know that whatever

5518.159 --> 5524.0
they

5519.199 --> 5529.199
say and try to show it is supposed to be

5524.0 --> 5532.88
can't exist so it's not that difficult

5529.199 --> 5537.04
you don't have to do all kinds of detail

5532.88 --> 5540.400000000001
work revealing little details about

5537.04 --> 5543.12
whatever they're presenting to basically

5540.4 --> 5546.32
use logic in order to disprove the

5543.12 --> 5549.599999999999
entire endeavor

5546.32 --> 5553.84
yeah it's not that difficult

5549.6 --> 5556.4800000000005
but i know that to you you cannot accept

5553.84 --> 5558.159000000001
the the laws of nature you can't you

5556.48 --> 5561.839999999999
can't accept that

5558.159 --> 5561.839999999999
you require a very specific

5562.32 --> 5567.92
container to have certain levels of gas

5565.52 --> 5567.92
pressure

5568.32 --> 5572.48
can't be infinite sized which is what is

5570.88 --> 5574.8
proposed

5572.48 --> 5575.599999999999
in the heliocentric model it can't be

5574.8 --> 5579.12
that can't

5575.6 --> 5579.120000000001
exist it's impossible

5580.96 --> 5587.199
you couldn't be here alive

5584.159 --> 5588.4
to figure out how it works if that was

5587.199 --> 5591.44
the case

5588.4 --> 5591.44
if that was real

5599.6 --> 5604.0
it's not oakley's pool it's called

5601.76 --> 5608.159000000001
natural law it's not

5604.0 --> 5613.44
kiwi's bull either it's natural lights

5608.159 --> 5616.879999999999
widely established established physics

5613.44 --> 5621.199
figured out by physicists

5616.88 --> 5624.639
like all of them in the past all of them

5621.199 --> 5626.48
not any opinionated or political ones or

5624.639 --> 5628.8
kooky ones or whatever

5626.48 --> 5631.5199999999995
all of them they just knew yeah it's

5628.8 --> 5634.639
natural law natural law means always

5631.52 --> 5638.56
everywhere always yeah

5634.639 --> 5641.679
it's not oakleys or kiwis

5638.56 --> 5645.360000000001
now that's you trying to straw man

5641.679 --> 5648.8
projecting the natural law

5645.36 --> 5651.44
the physical fact of reality

5648.8 --> 5653.76
established by the yeah the most

5651.44 --> 5657.199
down-to-earth

5653.76 --> 5657.679
minds in history you're putting that all

5657.199 --> 5662.48
on

5657.679 --> 5664.4
these people kiwi nathan oakley

5662.48 --> 5665.839999999999
now that's that's called a straw man

5664.4 --> 5669.599999999999
projection you see

5665.84 --> 5673.1990000000005
it's widely established natural law

5669.6 --> 5676.639
throughout history i'm sorry

5673.199 --> 5680.4
that your globe model can't use it

5676.639 --> 5687.84
i'm very sorry it gets in the way

5680.4 --> 5687.839999999999
it is true though

5688.719 --> 5691.84
yes there is a pressure gradient just as

5690.96 --> 5694.0
there is

5691.84 --> 5695.679
displacement passive displacement due to

5694.0 --> 5698.4
relative density

5695.679 --> 5700.08
it's very simple you take a container

5698.4 --> 5702.799999999999
fill it with gas

5700.08 --> 5703.199
relative density sets in the gas starts

5702.8 --> 5704.679
to

5703.199 --> 5709.919999999999
after it's filled the container

5704.679 --> 5712.639
redistribute within the volume available

5709.92 --> 5714.08
because of relative density it divides

5712.639 --> 5717.4400000000005
it up

5714.08 --> 5717.44
dense less dense

5717.92 --> 5721.1990000000005
because it's a pretty big volume still

5720.56 --> 5724.320000000001
yeah this

5721.199 --> 5726.32
is much more emphasized and then on top

5724.32 --> 5729.84
of that there is gas production

5726.32 --> 5733.199
at at the bottom causing a constant

5729.84 --> 5734.4800000000005
introduction or periodic constant

5733.199 --> 5737.44
introduction

5734.48 --> 5738.48
of extra gas pressure at ground level

5737.44 --> 5743.839999999999
kind of

5738.48 --> 5743.839999999999
emphasizing the gradient even further

5743.92 --> 5750.08
but it arranges itself in the gradient

5747.76 --> 5752.400000000001
because of relative density it happens

5750.08 --> 5754.719
on the small scale as well

5752.4 --> 5755.679
now of course it's not going to layer up

5754.719 --> 5760.8
like

5755.679 --> 5760.8
different layers of liquid for example

5761.199 --> 5765.199
it's not going to do that because it is

5764.639 --> 5766.96
gas

5765.199 --> 5768.839999999999
and gas goes in all directions it

5766.96 --> 5772.88
eventually just mashes

5768.84 --> 5774.96
in with a lot of other gas but it on

5772.88 --> 5778.719
average the less dense gas

5774.96 --> 5781.52
will mash out and spread around

5778.719 --> 5782.8
in the higher regions where it's less

5781.52 --> 5785.52
dense

5782.8 --> 5786.320000000001
than the heavier gas which will also

5785.52 --> 5789.280000000001
spread out

5786.32 --> 5793.5199999999995
in all directions but eventually end up

5789.28 --> 5796.8
in the mesh at the lower regions

5793.52 --> 5799.84
because of the density

5796.8 --> 5802.320000000001
so that that's what causes the gradient

5799.84 --> 5803.119000000001
that can only ever be if there is a

5802.32 --> 5806.239
specific

5803.119 --> 5813.839999999999
limited sized volume for the gas to

5806.239 --> 5813.839999999999
spread out in in the first place

5816.719 --> 5820.639
that's that's a complete lie larry the

5819.28 --> 5822.719
march you're lying now

5820.639 --> 5823.92
you or you simply are just blurting out

5822.719 --> 5825.28
something that you don't freaking

5823.92 --> 5828.8
understand

5825.28 --> 5832.5599999999995
there's all that it's not just a

5828.8 --> 5835.679
number it's a description it does have

5832.56 --> 5839.52
units it's called density

5835.679 --> 5843.76
dumbass and it has a freaking vector

5839.52 --> 5847.52
up and down up and down very specific

5843.76 --> 5850.0
yeah so everything you said is wrong

5847.52 --> 5850.8
you can't explain anything well you're

5850.0 --> 5853.6
lying

5850.8 --> 5855.4400000000005
or you're just really freaking stupid

5853.6 --> 5858.2390000000005
and triggered

5855.44 --> 5858.5599999999995
you can't help yourself from blurting

5858.239 --> 5862.879999999999
out

5858.56 --> 5865.679
absolute 180 degrees lies

5862.88 --> 5865.679
you can't help it

5866.96 --> 5870.32
you might just want to shut up

5876.56 --> 5882.639
yeah so gradient yeah gradient gradients

5880.4 --> 5886.719
can only happen

5882.639 --> 5889.28
within a container no container no

5886.719 --> 5892.32
gradient

5889.28 --> 5896.4
right and yeah

5892.32 --> 5900.48
here's another one gradients

5896.4 --> 5904.0
right gradients gradate

5900.48 --> 5908.32
in relation to the complete

5904.0 --> 5911.76
confine of the container that means

5908.32 --> 5912.719
the container is very large then the

5911.76 --> 5915.84
gradient

5912.719 --> 5918.159
will be very wide the gradient is not

5915.84 --> 5919.92
very wide then that means the container

5918.159 --> 5923.44
is not very large

5919.92 --> 5926.719
right so just think about that and then

5923.44 --> 5927.96
realize the outer space is supposed to

5926.719 --> 5931.84
be

5927.96 --> 5934.08
infinite infinite size

5931.84 --> 5936.88
right so how is there going to be any

5934.08 --> 5940.32
kind of gradient

5936.88 --> 5943.679
in an infinite sized container

5940.32 --> 5945.599999999999
can be because the gas can never settle

5943.679 --> 5948.08
it can never settle in order to form a

5945.6 --> 5948.08
gradient

5949.679 --> 5954.0
because a gradient always pans out in

5952.48 --> 5967.839999999999
relation

5954.0 --> 5967.84
to the total volume of the container

5969.36 --> 5981.839999999999
so frustrating isn't it when reality

5972.96 --> 5981.84
contradicts your dreams

5981.92 --> 5985.04
it's not natural

5985.28 --> 5990.239
yeah it is yeah it's natural yeah

5988.32 --> 5992.48
gas pressure expanding in all directions

5990.239 --> 5994.638999999999
to fill the available volume

5992.48 --> 5997.678999999999
the container yeah that's natural law

5994.639 --> 6001.1990000000005
second law of thermodynamics

5997.679 --> 6002.159
very old never disproven because if it

6001.199 --> 6005.119
was it wasn't

6002.159 --> 6006.879999999999
wouldn't be a natural law but if you're

6005.119 --> 6008.239
gonna claim that it's been this proof

6006.88 --> 6009.92
and then you gotta actually

6008.239 --> 6011.678999999999
physically demonstrate it to be

6009.92 --> 6014.08
disproven

6011.679 --> 6014.96
you can't oh yeah that's why it's been a

6014.08 --> 6017.44
natural law

6014.96 --> 6018.32
for a very long time and people very

6017.44 --> 6021.119
early

6018.32 --> 6022.08
that established this caught on like

6021.119 --> 6024.48
yeah

6022.08 --> 6026.639
yeah there's definitely not going to be

6024.48 --> 6029.5199999999995
an exception to this one

6026.639 --> 6030.08
and i'll bet you they tried oh they

6029.52 --> 6033.6
tried

6030.08 --> 6036.48
some way they tried some way to disprove

6033.6 --> 6038.56
it because that's what you have to do

6036.48 --> 6040.4
in order to disprove a natural law you

6038.56 --> 6043.280000000001
have to basically

6040.4 --> 6044.719
show the exception well they tried i bet

6043.28 --> 6046.4
you they did

6044.719 --> 6048.08
and they failed and that's why it's a

6046.4 --> 6052.4
natural law because it happens

6048.08 --> 6052.4
always always

6052.96 --> 6065.84
all right so be back two minutes

6151.86 --> 6163.839999999999
[Music]

6154.48 --> 6163.839999999999
hey dr sailor

6168.8 --> 6171.84
there is no laws of nature cue we made

6170.88 --> 6177.84
that up

6171.84 --> 6177.84
yeah rumpus oh that rumpus

6202.84 --> 6205.84
do

6253.36 --> 6257.119
oh i think the jackdaws are starting to

6255.92 --> 6260.32
build the new nest

6257.119 --> 6261.5199999999995
in the chimney seeing them hanging

6260.32 --> 6264.639
around making that

6261.52 --> 6266.400000000001
those noises again i think they're gonna

6264.639 --> 6275.84
make a new nest over there

6266.4 --> 6275.839999999999
that's cute

6281.92 --> 6286.84
yes rocket man the pressure gradient is

6284.239 --> 6288.0
a series of co-existing pressure

6286.84 --> 6292.08
differences

6288.0 --> 6292.08
yeah within the container

6292.639 --> 6299.1990000000005
right so if the container is

6295.84 --> 6300.96
infinite sized there can't be a fresher

6299.199 --> 6304.08
gradient

6300.96 --> 6307.28
because the bigger the container is

6304.08 --> 6310.96
the bigger the gradient will be

6307.28 --> 6310.96
within it right

6311.199 --> 6314.719
smaller the container the more

6314.84 --> 6319.360000000001
emphasized

6316.0 --> 6324.32
more noticeable any gradients

6319.36 --> 6327.119
the bigger it is the more spread out

6324.32 --> 6327.119
things will get

6328.48 --> 6331.839999999999
can't be infinite because then there can

6330.48 --> 6336.239
be a gradient

6331.84 --> 6339.4400000000005
gas will never have any chance to settle

6336.239 --> 6341.28
because it can never meet the limits

6339.44 --> 6343.199
of the volume of the container in an

6341.28 --> 6345.84
infinite container so it can never

6343.199 --> 6345.839999999999
form a gradient

6346.32 --> 6350.5599999999995
this is not too difficult to visualize

6356.84 --> 6359.84
guys

6360.96 --> 6365.04
psi means per square inch

6369.28 --> 6373.84
it's a volumetric

6384.84 --> 6387.84
measurement

6388.159 --> 6392.879999999999
okay well dr gonzo that's too bad then

6392.96 --> 6397.28
don't poke at them

6397.76 --> 6403.04
like that because at home yeah

6401.199 --> 6405.839999999999
don't care if you get triggered by

6403.04 --> 6408.239
somebody saying something in chat

6405.84 --> 6410.2390000000005
then don't start poking at them it's

6408.239 --> 6413.599999999999
very simple

6410.239 --> 6416.08
like i even stop

6413.6 --> 6417.92
people that i do trust when they attack

6416.08 --> 6420.4
ballers

6417.92 --> 6422.639
because they just are very sick of them

6420.4 --> 6423.44
for some reason in that moment i stopped

6422.639 --> 6425.92
them too

6423.44 --> 6429.599999999999
right so i'm gonna stop you too when you

6425.92 --> 6431.28
start ad homing other people in my chat

6429.6 --> 6433.280000000001
if you're going to be complaining pants

6431.28 --> 6438.5599999999995
about it i don't give a [ __ ]

6433.28 --> 6438.5599999999995
yeah you have no rights here you don't

6440.0 --> 6456.08
you have no no recourse

6443.04 --> 6458.4
to complain about behavior what i do

6456.08 --> 6460.32
yeah yeah that's right you do get the

6458.4 --> 6462.159
time out then

6460.32 --> 6464.639
because if you're just blatantly at

6462.159 --> 6464.638999999999
homing

6464.96 --> 6471.76
and getting pretty creepy at it as well

6469.119 --> 6473.28
not necessarily overtly but if you're

6471.76 --> 6475.76
going in that direction that

6473.28 --> 6476.4
then that will happen at some point you

6475.76 --> 6480.96
don't have

6476.4 --> 6480.96
unlimited freedom here dr gonzo you

6482.84 --> 6485.84
don't

6511.36 --> 6529.36
hey man do you

6526.4 --> 6529.36
you will see what

6534.719 --> 6538.32
what's the container made of of

6537.52 --> 6540.8
something that

6538.32 --> 6541.5199999999995
prevents the gas from expanding beyond

6540.8 --> 6555.84
it

6541.52 --> 6555.84
that's what the container is made of

6571.52 --> 6577.76
touchsailer don't don't do

6574.639 --> 6583.84
that don't

6577.76 --> 6583.84
don't go there

6584.32 --> 6587.199
yeah goodbye

6587.599 --> 6592.32
goodbye mister i'm so sad i'm i

6590.639 --> 6594.159000000001
what i have to be sad because you're

6592.32 --> 6595.92
insulted and now you're threatening to

6594.159 --> 6597.839999999999
go away well if you want to go away and

6595.92 --> 6601.92
stay away that's your damn business

6597.84 --> 6601.92
you want to come back then you come back

6602.239 --> 6607.598999999999
that's all fine if you're gonna at home

6605.28 --> 6609.28
somebody like that again then you will

6607.599 --> 6613.28
get a timeout and if you don't get a

6609.28 --> 6613.28
timeout by them you'll get it by me

6613.44 --> 6617.678999999999
if you can't handle that then goodbye

6622.84 --> 6629.28
bye

6625.36 --> 6629.28
some ears clean blew up

6630.4 --> 6634.48
look there's a lot of fantasizing of

6632.32 --> 6637.5199999999995
course about what exactly

6634.48 --> 6641.839999999999
is the nature of the container

6637.52 --> 6644.400000000001
i've speculated about it myself

6641.84 --> 6646.639
i just kind of tend to refrain from

6644.4 --> 6647.598999999999
conceiving it as some kind of specific

6646.639 --> 6650.639
material

6647.599 --> 6652.4800000000005
i'm much more interested into like the

6650.639 --> 6656.8
spatial nature

6652.48 --> 6660.4
of the available volume of the realm

6656.8 --> 6663.599
and like yeah

6660.4 --> 6667.119
could the the top on

6663.599 --> 6670.400000000001
us the top of the container could it be

6667.119 --> 6673.839999999999
the bottom of the earth

6670.4 --> 6678.08
could there simply be a volumetric

6673.84 --> 6680.0
limit to space in which matter can move

6678.08 --> 6682.08
that there will just be an effective

6680.0 --> 6683.599
barrier not made of a material but

6682.08 --> 6687.199
simply a limit for

6683.599 --> 6692.400000000001
material like there's like this limiter

6687.199 --> 6694.239
you could say simulatory nature element

6692.4 --> 6696.4
where simply it's like yeah this is

6694.239 --> 6698.718999999999
effectively like a perfect glass barrier

6696.4 --> 6701.92
there simply is no more volume

6698.719 --> 6702.719
beyond it for matter to move into like

6701.92 --> 6705.28
that

6702.719 --> 6706.08
i've forwarded that as a concept of what

6705.28 --> 6708.32
the

6706.08 --> 6711.36
yeah the volumetric barrier could be

6708.32 --> 6712.88
like it's all kinds of ways

6711.36 --> 6715.36
you can approach it or you could

6712.88 --> 6718.2390000000005
conceive of it as a material

6715.36 --> 6718.799999999999
or maybe an energy barrier that that is

6718.239 --> 6722.879999999999
like the

6718.8 --> 6725.76
barrier between a compartment beyond

6722.88 --> 6726.96
this specific realm that there may be an

6725.76 --> 6729.599
over realm

6726.96 --> 6731.36
and then what would its container be etc

6729.599 --> 6737.84
etc you know there's so many

6731.36 --> 6737.839999999999
ways you can think about it

6745.52 --> 6748.8
yes why don't i have the pictures why

6747.84 --> 6752.0
were you well

6748.8 --> 6756.400000000001
you didn't invest enough in me

6752.0 --> 6758.8
j hon you should have donated

6756.4 --> 6762.0
a couple of more million euros to my

6758.8 --> 6765.119000000001
paypal account and then maybe

6762.0 --> 6768.48
maybe in 20 years we'll we'll go there

6765.119 --> 6779.839999999999
how about that is that good enough

6768.48 --> 6779.839999999999
seems to work for nasa

6787.199 --> 6790.638999999999
right so why don't we have this well

6789.28 --> 6792.639
they pay up

6790.639 --> 6795.28
you want that you want that well

6792.639 --> 6798.0
freaking pay up

6795.28 --> 6799.04
a couple of million maybe billion that

6798.0 --> 6800.88
would do it

6799.04 --> 6803.199
then we can show you those things those

6800.88 --> 6804.84
lovely lovely things that you demand

6803.199 --> 6807.839999999999
from us

6804.84 --> 6807.84
right

6808.88 --> 6813.599
you paid for it with nasa so why won't

6812.159 --> 6815.679
you pay for it with us

6813.599 --> 6816.96
and then we'll do it i'll show you what

6815.679 --> 6821.679
it is

6816.96 --> 6825.599
right we're not gonna do that cheap

6821.679 --> 6830.639
so yeah donate to my paypal right now

6825.599 --> 6830.639
and maybe one day you will see those

6832.84 --> 6835.84
things

6836.08 --> 6840.239
for a few hundred pounds well that's

6837.599 --> 6840.2390000000005
good for him

6843.44 --> 6847.04
i'm not gonna do it for a few hundred

6845.199 --> 6850.879999999999
pounds though

6847.04 --> 6850.88
because i have bigger expenses

6851.92 --> 6855.4400000000005
and hey i'm not a technical expert as

6854.56 --> 6858.4800000000005
these things

6855.44 --> 6860.638999999999
if mr sensible wants to be that

6858.48 --> 6861.598999999999
he he has the connections and he can do

6860.639 --> 6865.679
that and

6861.599 --> 6868.08
can then tell you the ball earth doesn't

6865.679 --> 6870.4800000000005
have a geometric horizon

6868.08 --> 6871.199
oh wait right there there it is there's

6870.48 --> 6873.839999999999
the curve

6871.199 --> 6874.96
there's the edge right then he can do

6873.84 --> 6877.04
that

6874.96 --> 6878.88
so that's what he did that for and he

6877.04 --> 6880.96
didn't prove anything he didn't prove

6878.88 --> 6884.400000000001
the earthly ball

6880.96 --> 6886.4
just proved he's caught in a double

6884.4 --> 6889.759999999999
speak lie where he

6886.4 --> 6892.5599999999995
claims the horizon is the sphere edge

6889.76 --> 6895.52
and then at the same time this claims

6892.56 --> 6897.76
that he claims that

6895.52 --> 6897.76
so

6900.0 --> 6902.56
i don't see

6903.44 --> 6907.28
why i should be doing that like i could

6906.4 --> 6908.96
make a balloon

6907.28 --> 6910.5599999999995
theoretically and then i just show yeah

6908.96 --> 6912.719
look see yeah it's flat

6910.56 --> 6914.719
yeah the horizon it's at eye level yeah

6912.719 --> 6916.719
we know

6914.719 --> 6919.04
well what would that accomplish there's

6916.719 --> 6920.4
so many of those types of videos already

6919.04 --> 6923.28
out there

6920.4 --> 6925.5199999999995
you know why would a flat earther at

6923.28 --> 6929.04
this point send up a balloon

6925.52 --> 6931.92
when you can just let ballers do it

6929.04 --> 6934.32
take their footage leave out their

6931.92 --> 6937.52
stupid baller commentary

6934.32 --> 6939.199
and then just use their footage to show

6937.52 --> 6940.719
you how the earth is flat

6939.199 --> 6945.199
right we've already been doing that

6940.719 --> 6947.84
quite a few in the last few years so

6945.199 --> 6948.48
why why would we have to do all that

6947.84 --> 6952.639
[ __ ]

6948.48 --> 6952.638999999999
when we can just let ballers do it

6953.28 --> 6960.32
erase their nonsense commentary and just

6956.639 --> 6964.4800000000005
review it for what it is

6960.32 --> 6967.199
right not saying that you shouldn't

6964.48 --> 6968.159
donate a couple of million to my paypal

6967.199 --> 6971.5199999999995
though

6968.159 --> 6974.0
because in 20 years i might just do it

6971.52 --> 6975.360000000001
and that's good enough for you what's

6974.0 --> 6977.599
with nasa so

6975.36 --> 6978.88
yeah still do that right but in the

6977.599 --> 6982.08
meantime

6978.88 --> 6984.400000000001
this is a very cheap option just let

6982.08 --> 6986.96
ballers do these things to try and

6984.4 --> 6989.92
virtua signal their ball religion

6986.96 --> 6991.76
make them see you know capable and smart

6989.92 --> 6995.04
while they insert their nonsense

6991.76 --> 6996.96
over their actions

6995.04 --> 6998.96
over their technical footage and all

6996.96 --> 7002.0
that and just erase

6998.96 --> 7003.84
the blabbering and then just review

7002.0 --> 7007.36
the footage for what it is yeah it's a

7003.84 --> 7013.119000000001
lot easier and more effective too

7007.36 --> 7013.119
right so i'm gonna round out the show

7015.28 --> 7019.759999999999
thanks everyone for coming i hope you

7018.56 --> 7021.52
like the show

7019.76 --> 7023.92
if you did then please don't forget to

7041.28 --> 7045.119
support me through the paypal

7042.88 --> 7047.1990000000005
patreon crypto wallets super chat and

7045.119 --> 7050.88
the membership system join button

7047.199 --> 7054.638999999999
that would be much appreciated i will be

7050.88 --> 7056.84
back tomorrow flat earth early bird

7054.639 --> 7060.8
number

7056.84 --> 7062.08
817 on the friday edition

7060.8 --> 7064.320000000001
and i'm going to join the flat earth

7062.08 --> 7066.5599999999995
debates which should start up any minute

7064.32 --> 7066.5599999999995
now

7069.28 --> 7074.0
fema don't do that amanda young

7074.4 --> 7077.44
that's just terrible

7079.36 --> 7086.32
anyway hashtag me for michael o'rourke

7083.119 --> 7089.44
and until the next video keep it

7086.32 --> 7092.0
flat stationary and

7089.44 --> 7099.96
pressurized with gas thanks to the

7092.0 --> 7113.3
limited volume of the container

7099.96 --> 7114.32
