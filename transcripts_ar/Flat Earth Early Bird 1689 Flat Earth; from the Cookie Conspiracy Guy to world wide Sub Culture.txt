94.74 --> 99.439
beautiful

96.06 --> 99.43900000000001
still some clouds

99.54 --> 104.57900000000001
but lots of

102.0 --> 107.6
sunny skies there's a bit of wind which

104.579 --> 107.6
is actually kind of nice

112.14 --> 118.979
but yeah there's also trails

115.2 --> 121.74000000000001
that I'm noticing up there which I'm not

118.979 --> 125.84
very happy about

121.74 --> 125.83999999999999
there's some lines crossing the sky

126.84 --> 132.719
see that

128.86 --> 132.71900000000002
[Music]

133.379 --> 140.04
but I mean yeah with all these winds

136.92 --> 142.67999999999998
probably won't make too much impact

140.04 --> 146.879
it's very windy usually that sort of

142.68 --> 146.87900000000002
stuff just gets Blown Away disperses

147.239 --> 151.56
right but it's a beautiful day very

149.28 --> 153.239
sunny on average

151.56 --> 155.06
bit of wind which is actually nice

153.239 --> 158.129
because it's just really hot

155.06 --> 158.129
[Music]

158.879 --> 164.34
probably like around 25 27 degrees or

163.14 --> 167.57999999999998
something

164.34 --> 170.06
25 is a good estimate

167.58 --> 170.06
right

170.28 --> 173.28
contrast

174.0 --> 178.2
right

175.2 --> 180.599
hello dank first in chat Richard G good

202.56 --> 206.36
it

203.64 --> 206.35999999999999
huh

217.379 --> 220.379
ah

221.61 --> 224.679
[Music]

224.819 --> 229.56
25 is perfect

227.22 --> 232.76
it well it's great weather

229.56 --> 232.76
I'm very happy with this

234.0 --> 240.959
right had a pretty decent sleep despite

237.299 --> 244.26000000000002
nah it wasn't too late but a little bit

240.959 --> 246.659
that white cat the other cat

244.26 --> 249.0
seems to be like really into me now

246.659 --> 250.26
maybe she's like in love with me or

249.0 --> 252.84
something because she's like really

250.26 --> 254.12
hanging around a lot

252.84 --> 258.38
at night

254.12 --> 258.38
and she's extremely cuddly

259.199 --> 264.0
so that's been nice also had great

262.019 --> 266.94
dinner yesterday

264.0 --> 271.199
that meal that I said that I got

266.94 --> 273.84
with the pre-weekend funds

271.199 --> 276.90000000000003
yeah I made that yesterday it was really

273.84 --> 279.0
really worth it

276.9 --> 281.09999999999997
like

279.0 --> 283.5
there's so much stuff in there it's

281.1 --> 287.34000000000003
unbelievable

283.5 --> 289.979
basically put an entire pot of sambal

287.34 --> 293.11999999999995
in there with the chicken and the garlic

289.979 --> 293.12
and the coconut oil

294.54 --> 299.40000000000003
tumeric

296.52 --> 302.58
in there some ginger in there

299.4 --> 305.52
some well

302.58 --> 307.75899999999996
I guess they call that soy sauce the

305.52 --> 311.09999999999997
black stuff I don't think there's like

307.759 --> 313.68
gay chemicals in there though

311.1 --> 316.02000000000004
and if there is well too bad because

313.68 --> 319.38
that's like traditional

316.02 --> 322.19899999999996
Asian and it's really good with air with

319.38 --> 323.759
it so yeah and lots of vegetables with

322.199 --> 325.62
that

323.759 --> 327.72
carrots

325.62 --> 330.06
green beans

327.72 --> 332.1
celery

330.06 --> 333.72
uh

332.1 --> 336.06
broccoli

333.72 --> 339.84000000000003
and

336.06 --> 343.38
Chinese cabbage I think it's called

339.84 --> 345.96
wait no Pak soy that that was it not

343.38 --> 348.65999999999997
Chinese cabbage

345.96 --> 349.73999999999995
fantastic

348.66 --> 351.47900000000004
[Music]

349.74 --> 353.94
and I got like

351.479 --> 357.18
at least three days of food out of it

353.94 --> 360.419
maybe more probably three days but man I

357.18 --> 362.15000000000003
feel great having eaten that I'm not

360.419 --> 363.24
hungry at all

362.15 --> 366.419
[Music]

363.24 --> 368.699
or it's weird I'm not like oh I need the

366.419 --> 371.88
Illuminati Castle no I'm feeling like oh

368.699 --> 375.3
I can't wait to eat more of that

371.88 --> 378.12
that's what I what it feels like

375.3 --> 382.08
so yeah I'm doing great also

378.12 --> 384.84000000000003
roommate came back from vacation

382.08 --> 387.419
I've been watering her plants and she

384.84 --> 389.94
just gave me money for that

387.419 --> 394.31899999999996
I didn't even ask for it but that was

389.94 --> 397.139
like really really useful

394.319 --> 398.88
so yeah I'm I'm super happy I'm glad to

397.139 --> 401.039
have the roommate back it's really nice

398.88 --> 403.699
to see her again weather is great I've

401.039 --> 403.699
eaten great

405.8 --> 410.819
I've got white [ __ ]

408.66 --> 412.319
interested in me

410.819 --> 416.53900000000004
you know

412.319 --> 416.53900000000004
what else can a man want in life

422.639 --> 426.54
bok choy

425.28 --> 428.94
right

426.54 --> 431.32
[Music]

428.94 --> 442.3
hello Oz good to see you LSG

431.32 --> 442.3
[Music]

443.039 --> 446.21999999999997
right

444.0 --> 448.259
[Music]

446.22 --> 450.78000000000003
so yeah sorry for starting a bit late by

448.259 --> 452.22
the way it's I got re-up really early

450.78 --> 454.79999999999995
actually

452.22 --> 458.52000000000004
went out for groceries but then it all

454.8 --> 460.74
together last took more time than I kind

458.52 --> 462.74
of hoped so

460.74 --> 462.74
um

463.09 --> 467.58
[Music]

466.02 --> 469.979
but that

467.58 --> 471.05
waking up early certainly seems to be a

469.979 --> 476.47999999999996
good sign

471.05 --> 476.48
[Music]

476.58 --> 484.4
so I got all this extra nice weather

480.18 --> 484.40000000000003
right anyway oh yeah uh

484.56 --> 489.18
yesterday I started out the show

486.84 --> 491.4
weighing like super enthusiastic about

489.18 --> 493.44
ghost Wars and all that

491.4 --> 494.78
well I watched

493.44 --> 497.88
like

494.78 --> 500.21999999999997
yeah the rest of well it's pretty long

497.88 --> 502.919
series like 16 episodes but I've watched

500.22 --> 505.379
like now total of two-thirds of it

502.919 --> 507.919
and I'm starting to notice like it it

505.379 --> 507.91900000000004
yeah

508.02 --> 514.26
a distinct lack

511.319 --> 516.659
of story cohesion

514.26 --> 518.9399999999999
like that first

516.659 --> 522.899
those first few episodes

518.94 --> 525.6600000000001
they really had a thing like a spirit

522.899 --> 528.3
chemistry going among the actors like

525.66 --> 530.8199999999999
they really know knew who they were in

528.3 --> 533.8199999999999
the story and what they're doing

530.82 --> 537.3000000000001
and how they are like so it felt like

533.82 --> 542.1
really super cohesive but then

537.3 --> 544.13
after a few episodes it starts to become

542.1 --> 545.58
like messy

544.13 --> 547.2
[Music]

545.58 --> 549.6600000000001
and

547.2 --> 551.519
yeah I mean it's still

549.66 --> 554.459
like it's not the same as when it

551.519 --> 557.1
started out like it's not as good

554.459 --> 558.8389999999999
it's becoming more

557.1 --> 562.14
soapy

558.839 --> 564.72
and like it's obvious that like the

562.14 --> 565.74
script has seems to be more rushed or

564.72 --> 568.26
something

565.74 --> 570.42
after like they had a really good entry

568.26 --> 571.8
idea but then as they were actually

570.42 --> 575.279
developing it

571.8 --> 577.56
it they lost

575.279 --> 580.14
vision

577.56 --> 582.42
and they just started to pick

580.14 --> 585.66
things to keep going like that's what it

582.42 --> 588.779
starts to feel like and

585.66 --> 590.1
it becomes kind of like more of a messy

588.779 --> 593.22
uh

590.1 --> 598.98
jump scare

593.22 --> 601.8000000000001
killing slasher type of spooky horror

598.98 --> 603.54
in a way and that it really cheapens it

601.8 --> 605.519
up so yeah I feel kind of stupid

603.54 --> 607.74
yesterday being like oh this is the best

605.519 --> 611.9590000000001
thing ever it's so impressive and like

607.74 --> 613.98
because well it did start out like that

611.959 --> 616.38
but then

613.98 --> 618.839
like things start happening that would

616.38 --> 622.56
absolutely have like

618.839 --> 624.1800000000001
a massive character Transformations as a

622.56 --> 626.459
result like people would definitely

624.18 --> 627.959
change because of that and they kind of

626.459 --> 632.399
don't

627.959 --> 634.3199999999999
and that's just bad writing

632.399 --> 635.94
like it's not really even the actors

634.32 --> 638.339
they really do their best to make

635.94 --> 641.7600000000001
something of what they've been given

638.339 --> 644.8800000000001
but I did not like like I said like all

641.76 --> 648.56
this priest is so awesome but then

644.88 --> 652.98
he absolutely became not [ __ ] awesome

648.56 --> 656.76
also on top of that I started to see

652.98 --> 659.1800000000001
that there was freaking LGBT [ __ ] in

656.76 --> 659.18
there anyway

659.7 --> 663.6
yeah I just didn't really see it before

661.9 --> 667.1
[Music]

663.6 --> 667.1
so that yeah

667.8 --> 672.54
that was kind of disappointing in a way

670.65 --> 676.079
[Music]

672.54 --> 678.5999999999999
and and next time I'm gonna review a

676.079 --> 680.88
series I'm gonna actually watch through

678.6 --> 682.9200000000001
at least half of it before I start to

680.88 --> 686.04
formulate an opinion because you got all

682.92 --> 688.079
the enthusiasm that I had from the start

686.04 --> 689.459
yesterday

688.079 --> 693.56
but

689.459 --> 693.56
yeah none of the actual

696.18 --> 702.2399999999999
like what it actually turns out to be so

699.959 --> 703.9399999999999
here's the second half of the review of

702.24 --> 706.2
Ghost Wars

703.94 --> 708.5600000000001
it's not as good as I thought it was

706.2 --> 708.5600000000001
gonna be

708.959 --> 713.399
but it had like a lot of potential

712.14 --> 714.72
I mean

713.399 --> 717.72
like

714.72 --> 719.9200000000001
the medium guy he starts to [ __ ] turn

717.72 --> 722.4590000000001
into a gamma

719.92 --> 725.2199999999999
[Music]

722.459 --> 727.5
it's annoying it's like everything is

725.22 --> 730.62
gamma is gamma fighting

727.5 --> 734.519
like at first it was just like

730.62 --> 736.32
typical like witty interaction it seemed

734.519 --> 738.6
a little logical but then eventually

736.32 --> 741.0
like people start to

738.6 --> 742.8000000000001
follow like a gamma type pattern

741.0 --> 745.3
behavior and that's like what the [ __ ]

742.8 --> 748.3599999999999
this is so annoying now

745.3 --> 748.3599999999999
[Music]

748.5 --> 753.48
like transitioning from like a proper

751.2 --> 756.0600000000001
spirited

753.48 --> 758.76
place where you get the feel of what

756.06 --> 761.64
it's like there and then it turns into

758.76 --> 763.38
like an Eli raw horror

761.64 --> 765.3
Slasher

763.38 --> 769.98
and if you know any of those movies

765.3 --> 772.3199999999999
they're really kind of trashy and like

769.98 --> 775.44
stupid City kids not taking anything

772.32 --> 778.38
serious type right well that's kind of

775.44 --> 781.0400000000001
what it it really does turn into it's

778.38 --> 781.04
kind of stupid

782.22 --> 786.36
and things like

783.959 --> 788.88
characters that die just become

786.36 --> 791.279
pointless

788.88 --> 794.3389999999999
and it's like how do you do that how do

791.279 --> 797.639
you have something that starts out so

794.339 --> 799.32
so promising and then just kind of like

797.639 --> 802.0790000000001
mess it up

799.32 --> 803.279
and it's completely because of bad

802.079 --> 805.8599999999999
writing because there's been other

803.279 --> 809.16
series that

805.86 --> 811.8000000000001
do similar type mystery unfolding

809.16 --> 814.38
situations I mean I've seen many of them

811.8 --> 816.18
by now through Netflix what's that

814.38 --> 818.639
Australian one again where people just

816.18 --> 822.18
suddenly wake up out of their graves

818.639 --> 826.62
well that one is very similar to this

822.18 --> 828.2399999999999
except they really write it well all the

826.62 --> 831.0
way

828.24 --> 834.24
and it actually gets even better

831.0 --> 836.279
as it progresses well not with this one

834.24 --> 838.32
with this one's like the exact opposite

836.279 --> 840.6
it's like really the character chemistry

838.32 --> 844.7600000000001
at first really holds it up and then

840.6 --> 844.76
just the story writing becomes so

845.6 --> 849.839
soapish cheap

848.76 --> 852.0
[Music]

849.839 --> 853.98
it's like things that are happening

852.0 --> 856.74
should work

853.98 --> 858.779
but because how it's all put together it

856.74 --> 862.019
doesn't really work and it kind of feels

858.779 --> 865.079
cheap and it even starts to feel a

862.019 --> 867.48
little bit which is weird yeah because I

865.079 --> 869.579
mentioned it yesterday like ooh stranger

867.48 --> 874.6800000000001
things but not with

869.579 --> 876.9799999999999
like weird [ __ ] and monster plants well

874.68 --> 880.8599999999999
they kind of go for that anyway

876.98 --> 883.62
eventually which is like why what

880.86 --> 886.32
like you had the freaking weird ghost

883.62 --> 888.24
things and and now suddenly that and

886.32 --> 892.279
like

888.24 --> 892.279
it just becomes messy

893.279 --> 898.139
and like there's interesting stuff about

895.44 --> 900.6
it but it just becomes

898.139 --> 902.76
the spell doesn't work it's like you

900.6 --> 905.22
just get C like oh they're just trying

902.76 --> 908.519
to be interesting oh just keeping you on

905.22 --> 911.1
the mystery what's next and it's like

908.519 --> 914.639
yeah

911.1 --> 917.639
somebody say something for [ __ ] sake

914.639 --> 917.639

921.36 --> 926.279
don't say nothing for freaking 10

924.18 --> 927.7199999999999

Jesus

930.18 --> 935.9399999999999
right anyway

932.279 --> 938.639
ghost Wars not as good I guess that the

935.94 --> 941.8800000000001
name was it does sound a bit cheapish

938.639 --> 943.52
and that name does seem appropriate

941.88 --> 949.079
after a while anyway

943.52 --> 954.5
[Music]

[Music]

1109.299 --> 1115.539
Richard G

1112.58 --> 1115.539
go though

1116.539 --> 1123.02
right so yeah other than

1119.679 --> 1125.7800000000002
that review correction

1123.02 --> 1129.58
of ghost Wars I don't really have

1125.78 --> 1129.58
anything specific to talk about

1129.919 --> 1132.919
foreign

1135.4 --> 1142.3600000000001
yesterday that was kind of fun he made

1138.86 --> 1142.36
this hilarious Dell song

1143.539 --> 1147.49
and he's not a very good song but it was

1145.7 --> 1150.569
funny

1147.49 --> 1150.569
[Music]

1150.799 --> 1159.259
French toast all right

1153.84 --> 1159.259
[Music]

1162.56 --> 1172.85
[Music]

1170.26 --> 1195.749
so that was going on

1172.85 --> 1195.7489999999998
[Music]

1196.039 --> 1199.0
completely

1200.59 --> 1206.83
[Music]

1207.679 --> 1210.9
so yesterday was overall kind of a quiet

1210.02 --> 1230.6
day

1210.9 --> 1233.919
[Music]

1230.6 --> 1233.9189999999999
all right so the

1234.2 --> 1238.039
taiwai

1236.419 --> 1241.3400000000001
Kawaii

1238.039 --> 1244.28
forest fires are probably

1241.34 --> 1246.6399999999999
very similar to what happened in in

1244.28 --> 1246.6399999999999
Canada

1247.039 --> 1251.72
and

1249.5 --> 1253.82
California

1251.72 --> 1257.72
so that's what's coming out

1253.82 --> 1260.799
it's likely been lit by people by

1257.72 --> 1260.799
climate activists

1260.82 --> 1263.9299999999998
[Music]

1274.6 --> 1278.9599999999998
right

1276.34 --> 1280.3999999999999
and if this is going to be a reoccurring

1278.96 --> 1282.16
thing

1280.4 --> 1283.52
then I suggest

1282.16 --> 1285.8200000000002
[Music]

1283.52 --> 1290.02
that they should be internationally

1285.82 --> 1290.02
declared climate terrorists

1291.86 --> 1298.78
and that anybody that's caught

1295.82 --> 1298.78
setting fire

1299.48 --> 1304.0
should be set on fire

1304.22 --> 1308.419
I think there should be a brutal

1306.98 --> 1311.0
punishment

1308.419 --> 1311.5500000000002
that should be laid out for people that

1311.0 --> 1317.0
do this

1311.55 --> 1317.0
[Music]

1320.059 --> 1328.4189999999999
like I definitely don't think that

1322.78 --> 1328.4189999999999
imprisonment is going to be sufficient

1333.14 --> 1338.1200000000001
like an actual turret I don't even know

1335.6 --> 1339.9189999999999
how a terrorist gets penalized except

1338.12 --> 1342.32
that they get like Maximum Security

1339.919 --> 1344.8300000000002
Prison [ __ ] and all that

1342.32 --> 1349.52
I think that's not enough I mean

1344.83 --> 1351.799
[Music]

1349.52 --> 1355.36
like for example if you're like a

1351.799 --> 1357.9189999999999
religious terrorist like this this crazy

1355.36 --> 1360.799
Grappler Islam

1357.919 --> 1363.74
right that that wants to force everybody

1360.799 --> 1365.36
to convert which is completely not

1363.74 --> 1367.94
logical

1365.36 --> 1370.6999999999998
according to Islam it contradicts the

1367.94 --> 1373.64
actual teaching

1370.7 --> 1376.3600000000001
well they actually had at least

1373.64 --> 1376.3600000000001
they

1378.32 --> 1384.86
it's like [ __ ] up but at least they're

1381.26 --> 1387.559
trying to achieve something

1384.86 --> 1389.4799999999998
that is like

1387.559 --> 1392.86
yeah it's [ __ ] up but it's like a

1389.48 --> 1395.24
doable thing while climate terrorists

1392.86 --> 1396.5
they literally don't even know what

1395.24 --> 1401.2
they're doing and they're just

1396.5 --> 1404.799
destroying things it's it's pure

1401.2 --> 1404.799
delusional vandalism

1404.9 --> 1410.7800000000002
and it destroys things that are it

1408.02 --> 1414.08
destroys nature and these people need to

1410.78 --> 1416.299
be like brutally thought

1414.08 --> 1419.299
I mean

1416.299 --> 1422.6
if it were up to be I'd set a policy

1419.299 --> 1424.6399999999999
internationally like what your

1422.6 --> 1427.8799999999999
a police

1424.64 --> 1430.6000000000001
or a forest guard or anybody and you

1427.88 --> 1434.419
spot people like that

1430.6 --> 1437.539
Marxist like in black clothes and and

1434.419 --> 1440.179
looking weird

1437.539 --> 1442.4
and they're probably climate activists

1440.179 --> 1444.799
and they're lighting fire you catch them

1442.4 --> 1447.3200000000002
then I give you full permission to

1444.799 --> 1449.559
literally beat them to death with a

1447.32 --> 1449.559
stick

1452.059 --> 1458.84
I'd set that policy you you get caught

1455.419 --> 1462.64
trying to set a fire

1458.84 --> 1462.6399999999999
as like a political thing

1463.039 --> 1469.41
you get you literally get green lighted

1467.0 --> 1486.699
to be beaten to death with a stick

1469.41 --> 1486.699
[Music]

1488.179 --> 1494.7800000000002
or maybe like impaled

1491.12 --> 1497.9599999999998
on a on a big tree branch in the forest

1494.78 --> 1501.02
maybe that maybe that would be that it's

1497.96 --> 1503.48
getting too far but seriously I am so

1501.02 --> 1507.799
[ __ ] pissed off at those people

1503.48 --> 1510.5
if I ever walk into a forest and I catch

1507.799 --> 1513.9189999999999
some of these people there

1510.5 --> 1517.28
trying to light the forest on Fires I

1513.919 --> 1520.659
will [ __ ] impale them

1517.28 --> 1520.6589999999999
and leave them there

1521.96 --> 1527.0
maybe use their own

1524.48 --> 1529.64
equipment that they were gonna use to

1527.0 --> 1530.96
light the place on fire to set them on

1529.64 --> 1532.7
fire

1530.96 --> 1534.43
but make sure that the force doesn't

1532.7 --> 1547.1200000000001
burn down when I do

1534.43 --> 1549.02

destroy everything life itself

all for power it cannot be more satanic

1577.46 --> 1583.52
these people must be

brutally punished

brutally

1587.72 --> 1594.38
they don't listen to anything else

where everything is turned inside out

1597.44 --> 1601.64

1599.48 --> 1605.24
and the only thing that will make it

1601.64 --> 1608.1200000000001
matter is if they see their own

1605.24 --> 1611.0
get tortured

it's like a signal like hey it's not

1693.98 --> 1698.1200000000001
correct that's the first to get caught I

1698.12 --> 1702.7399999999998
[ __ ]

1700.22 --> 1707.179
I think Greta is just

1702.74 --> 1710.059
she's just a a propaganda icon

I mean she's she's more of a politician

1710.059 --> 1714.1399999999999
really than an activist like what the

he doesn't [ __ ] do anything I don't

1719.96 --> 1723.98
think she actually likes stuff on fire I

fixed

this enemy that we all face now Satan

than supposed World War II Nazis okay

have no Allegiance

yeah

1905.96 --> 1912.82
if you Harbor or protect

1909.919 --> 1916.46
one of these [ __ ] environmentalist

1912.82 --> 1918.9189999999999
satanists that destroy everything

1916.46 --> 1922.52

1918.919 --> 1927.5590000000002
themselves will never even touch

1922.52 --> 1929.539
then you should be marked as a terrorist

1927.559 --> 1933.34
sympathizer

1929.539 --> 1933.34
with actual consequences

1936.74 --> 1941.84
yeah it's not about like oh what I can

1939.44 --> 1944.419
imagine why they would do it and I would

1941.84 --> 1946.1589999999999
never do it but I yeah I get it I have

1944.419 --> 1947.72
some sympathy that's not the same if

1946.159 --> 1951.64
you're just some stupid social media

1947.72 --> 1951.64
person no if you're like actively

1951.82 --> 1957.5
preventing such an individual from

1955.1 --> 1961.399
being caught

1957.5 --> 1964.76
right because it's your family ah yeah

1961.399 --> 1968.299
you let your family become that yeah I

1964.76 --> 1970.8799999999999
mean don't like let's just it is worth

1968.299 --> 1972.1399999999999
like I said it yesterday it's worse it's

1970.88 --> 1975.14
worse

1972.14 --> 1978.3200000000002
than if you let your kid

1975.14 --> 1980.48
become trans and have an operation and

1978.32 --> 1982.279
basically castrate them yeah I mean

1980.48 --> 1984.679
that's pretty terrible but it's like

1982.279 --> 1986.6
your own freaking shame

1984.679 --> 1988.8200000000002
you let that happen to your own

1986.6 --> 1991.399
offspring that's pretty [ __ ] up

1988.82 --> 1993.559
right and the hope to God that they are

1991.399 --> 1994.4599999999998
not also going to be a pedo later or

1993.559 --> 1997.7
whatever

1994.46 --> 1998.81

stunts to burn down [ __ ] for climate

2017.799 --> 2023.679
change control policy

them ever like they're terrorists

2029.5 --> 2034.059

2048.339 --> 2055.54
kid's a [ __ ] terrorist

2051.58 --> 2058.3199999999997

2055.54 --> 2058.32
culpable

2064.0 --> 2068.719
and if you can't [ __ ] handle it then

unfortunate enough to have a kid like

2084.639 --> 2089.139
that well guess what you should have

2086.679 --> 2091.7200000000003
gotten more kids yeah because then you

2089.139 --> 2094.179
can afford to lose some when they turn

2091.72 --> 2096.04
into rotten beasts

2094.179 --> 2098.5
which can happen

2096.04 --> 2099.46
yeah that's why you should have more

2098.5 --> 2102.46
kids

2099.46 --> 2105.64
so that if one grossed into an insane

2102.46 --> 2107.8
satanic witch that you can afford

2105.64 --> 2110.44
for them to die

2107.8 --> 2113.44
and not hold on with everything you've

2110.44 --> 2116.4

[Music]

2205.96 --> 2213.2200000000003

whatever but it isn't there is no such

2249.88 --> 2253.78
thing

2250.9 --> 2256.06
doesn't exist it's a concept it's a

fictional concept that they made up and

2256.06 --> 2259.14
try to force on everybody

yeah and animals don't have trans

2267.7 --> 2273.46

2270.099 --> 2275.079
yeah animals might have like homosexual

that sort of thing

wide ecological studies

2283.599 --> 2289.78
that have proven that the environment

2285.72 --> 2292.1189999999997
does have an influence like um

2289.78 --> 2295.78
how much percentage

2292.119 --> 2297.82
of the species actually does that sort

2295.78 --> 2301.42
of behavior there's oh and there's like

2297.82 --> 2304.599
social rituals among more uh Advanced

where it can somebody can be like put in

2308.56 --> 2313.72
that position socially it's all

2312.28 --> 2317.52
so

2313.72 --> 2317.52
it has nothing to do with trans

2317.8 --> 2322.26
trance is a social construct

2324.4 --> 2329.64
it doesn't exist it's not a behavior

as long as they do it in private

2561.7 --> 2566.68
interaction even in the past I find

2564.64 --> 2570.2799999999997
trans people to be

2566.68 --> 2574.359
much more comfortable interacting with

3096.48 --> 3100.02
pragmatic here

3097.98 --> 3102.18
if you're going to be a trans

3100.02 --> 3104.4
you'd be [ __ ] saying to have your

genitals transition because that

you'll never experience anything that's

you'd be crazy to do anything like of

of course

3126.599 --> 3131.94
like oh no that might be weird oh really

3129.599 --> 3133.319
so you're just literally gonna castrate

3131.94 --> 3136.38
yourself then

3133.319 --> 3138.48
like never have sex ever again

3136.38 --> 3139.8

you might end up with some high paying

3725.4 --> 3728.819
job no no

3726.599 --> 3731.2200000000003

have to give higher guarantees than that

3731.22 --> 3733.7
yeah

3733.799 --> 3738.42
you must know that you will have the

3736.98 --> 3741.059
investment

3738.42 --> 3743.94
of this giant expensive operation which

3741.059 --> 3748.02
is called going to University you know

3743.94 --> 3750.66
that you you need to have that plan

3748.02 --> 3753.72
to be able to pay it off

3750.66 --> 3757.02
you need to have that before you [ __ ]

3753.72 --> 3759.0
go there if you don't you don't go there

3757.02 --> 3761.16
then

3759.0 --> 3763.799
because you're gonna waste your money on

3761.16 --> 3766.02
[ __ ] and connecting up with people

3763.799 --> 3768.18
that are completely [ __ ] up and

3766.02 --> 3770.22
probably Marxist terrorists of the

3768.18 --> 3772.0789999999997
future

3770.22 --> 3773.7
that's what you're going to be doing if

3772.079 --> 3776.579
you don't know what you're gonna do

3773.7 --> 3779.3999999999996
after this school yeah

3776.579 --> 3781.7000000000003
you need to know you need to have a plan

3779.4 --> 3783.0
or you're not going

3781.7 --> 3785.0989999999997
[Music]

3783.0 --> 3788.16
and then as you're going

3785.099 --> 3791.6400000000003
then you're going to be upheld to uphold

3788.16 --> 3794.0989999999997
the plan that you made and if you don't

3791.64 --> 3796.81
you get pulled out

3794.099 --> 3799.26
no [ __ ] tricks

3796.81 --> 3801.839
[Music]

3799.26 --> 3804.1800000000003
you're gonna make a plan and you're

3801.839 --> 3807.93
going to follow through on the plan and

3804.18 --> 3815.839
if you don't no [ __ ] school for you

3807.93 --> 3819.1189999999997
[Music]

3815.839 --> 3820.14
that's how I do it that's how they did

3819.119 --> 3823.8700000000003
it

3820.14 --> 3826.44
in this in the 17 18th and 19th century

3823.87 --> 3830.16
[Music]

3826.44 --> 3832.26
don't just go to some place

3830.16 --> 3835.859
and then hope everything will work out

3832.26 --> 3838.619
yeah there's only one group that

3835.859 --> 3840.299
actually does that and it works you know

3838.619 --> 3844.1400000000003
which group that is

3840.299 --> 3846.24
the [ __ ] nobility you see they're

3844.14 --> 3847.44
going to get that function no matter

3846.24 --> 3850.14
what

3847.44 --> 3853.14
so to them it's just

3850.14 --> 3855.54
rubbing elbows getting to know some

3853.14 --> 3857.64
competition getting some friends that's

3855.54 --> 3859.92
what it is to them because they're

3857.64 --> 3861.839
always going to get that function

3859.92 --> 3865.92
right their nobility they're just gonna

3861.839 --> 3868.68
be giving it yeah that's the difference

3865.92 --> 3870.9
and the super rich class have the same

3868.68 --> 3873.1189999999997
like they're always gonna get a high

3870.9 --> 3876.7200000000003
paying job daddy will just give it to

3873.119 --> 3879.54
them after they're done right so unless

3876.72 --> 3880.68
your super high class Rich spoiled

3879.54 --> 3882.599
[ __ ]

3880.68 --> 3885.299
there's no [ __ ] point for you even

3882.599 --> 3886.6800000000003
going to a university

3885.299 --> 3887.64
it's like what are you gonna get out of

3886.68 --> 3891.0589999999997
it

3887.64 --> 3894.299
do you have that guaranteed job is that

3891.059 --> 3897.6600000000003
job waiting for you after you graduate

3894.299 --> 3899.819
on on on paper

3897.66 --> 3903.1189999999997
an actual guarantee are you gonna get

3899.819 --> 3907.079
that or are you just oh I'll find out

3903.119 --> 3910.26
what I'll do yeah well then you don't go

3907.079 --> 3913.38
yeah you'll just have to settle hanging

3910.26 --> 3914.63
around with your village friends then

3913.38 --> 3919.2690000000002
which is for free

3914.63 --> 3919.2690000000002
[Music]

3922.26 --> 3927.059
right well in the meantime you can do

3924.72 --> 3931.04
actual work that will make actual money

3927.059 --> 3931.0400000000004
and learn actual skills

3933.66 --> 3936.739
[Music]

3938.16 --> 3943.19
glad I got the

3940.799 --> 3946.2599999999998
conversation back on track

3943.19 --> 3948.66
[Music]

3946.26 --> 3951.26
it's on a proper track away from

3948.66 --> 3951.2599999999998
[ __ ]

3951.299 --> 3959.71
foreign

3953.46 --> 3959.71
[Music]

3962.22 --> 3966.1189999999997
right and unfortunately there's no more

3964.559 --> 3969.2000000000003
Wizards there it's just a bunch of

3966.119 --> 3969.2000000000003
marxist warlocks

3969.34 --> 3998.76
[Music]

3996.119 --> 4000.799
all right choose a job that you will

3998.76 --> 4002.8390000000004
love so you never have to work a day in

4000.799 --> 4004.579
your life yeah and the weird thing is

4002.839 --> 4008.319
for me personally and I never went to

4004.579 --> 4008.319
University I did went to middle school

4008.42 --> 4014.299
and learned a lot it was a good middle

4010.22 --> 4017.299
school so I was like higher education so

4014.299 --> 4019.819
I did get to learn a lot and that had

4017.299 --> 4023.14
good teachers that was very important

4019.819 --> 4023.14
good teachers is everything

4024.02 --> 4028.64
right

4025.46 --> 4030.68
but I did not know for the life of me

4028.64 --> 4033.98
what the hell I was gonna do

4030.68 --> 4037.299
because the best ideas I had is like oh

4033.98 --> 4040.039
you're gonna be like an artist

4037.299 --> 4041.66
brilliant strategy are win [ __ ]

4040.039 --> 4043.46
brilliant oh you're gonna be an artist

4041.66 --> 4046.52
oh yes

4043.46 --> 4049.28
oh that's a proper career

4046.52 --> 4050.839
it's not completely [ __ ] unstable at

4049.28 --> 4052.3390000000004
all traditionally

4050.839 --> 4054.619
right

4052.339 --> 4057.98
so I never really figured out a

4054.619 --> 4059.119
profession I just knew I like to talk a

4057.98 --> 4062.359
lot

4059.119 --> 4064.88
and I like to think a lot

4062.359 --> 4067.22
I actually wanted to become a teacher

4064.88 --> 4069.619
but then realized that that would so

4067.22 --> 4072.5
[ __ ] me up because

4069.619 --> 4073.76
the programs would railroad what I had

4072.5 --> 4076.16
to teach

4073.76 --> 4079.1600000000003
and that would [ __ ] me up because then I

4076.16 --> 4081.5
can't be pure and honest anymore

4079.16 --> 4083.66
so I never became a professional teacher

4081.5 --> 4087.4
specifically because of that because of

4083.66 --> 4087.3999999999996
the lack of Freedom that I would get

4089.559 --> 4093.559
so this is what it is this is what has

4092.359 --> 4096.799
become

4093.559 --> 4099.259
somebody that talks on YouTube

4096.799 --> 4102.08
this is my profession this is my career

4099.259 --> 4103.699
it is the place where I do have that

4102.08 --> 4105.98
full freedom

4103.699 --> 4110.739
which to me is like the most precious

4105.98 --> 4110.739
good it's like I have gold every day

4113.66 --> 4116.139999999999
right

4116.359 --> 4120.679
to me this is like a gold mining

4118.52 --> 4124.040000000001
operation

4120.679 --> 4125.96
and yeah I'll be hungry I'll be

4124.04 --> 4127.64
miserable

4125.96 --> 4131.06
at times

4127.64 --> 4133.759
a lot of friction a lot of backstabbing

4131.06 --> 4135.620000000001
people secretly betraying is just like

4133.759 --> 4137.779
gold mining isn't it

4135.62 --> 4141.0199999999995
right

4137.779 --> 4143.0
digging digging barely eating you gotta

4141.02 --> 4145.339000000001
keep digging gigging and then suddenly

4143.0 --> 4147.92
you score and then you gotta worry that

4145.339 --> 4150.44
you don't get backstabbed well that's

4147.92 --> 4153.5
kind of what I'm doing here

4150.44 --> 4155.839
I've just really glad I found a reliable

4153.5 --> 4159.319
crew but even with the freaking reliable

4155.839 --> 4163.12
Crew That's Just endless bickering

4159.319 --> 4163.120000000001
even with a good crew

4166.88 --> 4174.1990000000005
and unfortunately it doesn't really get

4170.299 --> 4176.239
like translated eventually into actual

4174.199 --> 4178.46
money although I do get support I do get

4176.239 --> 4179.9
some support right but I mean a gold

4178.46 --> 4183.259
digger

4179.9 --> 4184.94
is not like gonna score super high all

4183.259 --> 4187.58
the time like

4184.94 --> 4191.719
gold diggers they really mostly just do

4187.58 --> 4196.66
because it's it's fun it's fun to do

4191.719 --> 4196.66
it's you can have a good time in nature

4197.179 --> 4203.96
that's like gold diggers that water pan

4201.02 --> 4206.0
like pan Diggers at a river

4203.96 --> 4207.38
I mean if you're actually going to dig

4206.0 --> 4209.54
into mine

4207.38 --> 4212.719
you're gonna have to have a score

4209.54 --> 4214.48
because it's not pleasant at all digging

4212.719 --> 4217.96
gold in a mine

4214.48 --> 4221.49
you you will have to have that

4217.96 --> 4222.679
foreknowledge that you're gonna score

4221.49 --> 4225.26
[Music]

4222.679 --> 4227.4800000000005
because a couple of gold flicks is not

4225.26 --> 4229.46
gonna suffice then

4227.48 --> 4230.9
because it sucks you're not out in

4229.46 --> 4234.5
nature you're in the middle of a mine

4230.9 --> 4236.9
you're smelling dust you have gas

4234.5 --> 4239.42
hazards all that [ __ ]

4236.9 --> 4241.699
so if you're mining you will definitely

4239.42 --> 4243.8
want to be sure that you're gonna

4241.699 --> 4246.799999999999
eventually find the score

4243.8 --> 4249.1990000000005
otherwise you're [ __ ] on your gold

4246.8 --> 4252.08
panning not so much because hey you're

4249.199 --> 4256.28
still gonna have a great outdoor day

4252.08 --> 4259.28
at a river in nature fresh air

4256.28 --> 4260.599999999999
and that's gonna be great anyhow

4259.28 --> 4263.08
with your friends

4260.6 --> 4263.08
right

4265.21 --> 4268.26
[Music]

4268.88 --> 4273.679
but yeah

4270.679 --> 4275.78
so this this is what I eventually ended

4273.679 --> 4278.179
up I just wanted to be able to talk and

4275.78 --> 4280.159
then have my talking

4278.179 --> 4282.56
be the value

4280.159 --> 4285.46
like I wanted to say things that would

4282.56 --> 4285.46
be valuable

4287.239 --> 4293.0599999999995
I always wanted to just like contribute

4289.52 --> 4296.42
to Universal human knowledge like to to

4293.06 --> 4298.580000000001
help everybody out because thinking is

4296.42 --> 4301.04
so freaking tiresome

4298.58 --> 4302.78
thinking is very tiresome to a lot of

4301.04 --> 4306.32
people

4302.78 --> 4309.679
except this guy because for me it's

4306.32 --> 4312.32
exactly the opposite for me

4309.679 --> 4316.1
people that don't think and that are

4312.32 --> 4317.36
just doing is like atrocious to me even

4316.1 --> 4320.659000000001
though it's actually kind of normal

4317.36 --> 4324.139999999999
because like my thinking never stops it

4320.659 --> 4327.379999999999
it never actually shuts down even when I

4324.14 --> 4329.780000000001
cognitively don't think guess what my

4327.38 --> 4332.38
Consciousness then starts to basically

4329.78 --> 4332.38
do like

4332.56 --> 4338.719
internal checkups on my systems

4336.56 --> 4340.88
seriously it's like I I can't stop

4338.719 --> 4345.08
thinking even when I'm not cognitively

4340.88 --> 4348.02
thinking like up here then it's like oh

4345.08 --> 4350.179
then that activity simply becomes

4348.02 --> 4352.34
rerouted into like weird checkup

4350.179 --> 4355.46
routines

4352.34 --> 4357.62
that are not cognitive but that are like

4355.46 --> 4360.199
attention it's like my attention just

4357.62 --> 4361.76
never stops my attention is always going

4360.199 --> 4363.69
to something

4361.76 --> 4365.179
it's never like

4363.69 --> 4367.219
[Music]

4365.179 --> 4370.46
what whoa it's half hour later like that

4367.219 --> 4372.5
never happens to me never

4370.46 --> 4374.6
it used to happen more

4372.5 --> 4377.42
it's like I get dreamy

4374.6 --> 4380.179
or yeah when I get sleepy it does happen

4377.42 --> 4382.28
when I get sleepy then it's like yeah

4380.179 --> 4384.26
then I'm not gonna respond

4382.28 --> 4386.78
but then as soon as I wake up it's just

4384.26 --> 4389.179
immediately get active and get cognitive

4386.78 --> 4392.8
and like oh ideas oh hey

4389.179 --> 4392.8
it's like it won't stop

4393.739 --> 4399.799999999999
and the only real way to to turn that

4396.44 --> 4402.0199999999995
into like a product is to basically have

4399.8 --> 4403.64
a Daily Show where you talk for two

4402.02 --> 4408.219
hours straight every freaking day

4403.64 --> 4408.219
forever the rest of your life

4408.97 --> 4412.029
[Music]

4413.3 --> 4418.820000000001
so yeah to me it does feel like I'm this

4416.659 --> 4421.699
what I do here the early virtue is like

4418.82 --> 4424.5199999999995
gold panning every day and sometimes I

4421.699 --> 4426.678999999999
find amazing snow gold flakes

4424.52 --> 4429.8
and sometimes it's kind of like yeah

4426.679 --> 4432.76
weather sucks

4429.8 --> 4436.04
don't have enough food

4432.76 --> 4437.900000000001
uh but I'm gonna do it anyway

4436.04 --> 4439.46
and all the days it's like whoa this is

4437.9 --> 4441.679
great

4439.46 --> 4443.54
look at what we're catching here

4441.679 --> 4446.54
wow

4443.54 --> 4448.1
all that recent storm like broke open

4446.54 --> 4450.3
these rocks

4448.1 --> 4451.46
look at all the gold meds inside there

4450.3 --> 4451.900000000001
[Music]

4451.46 --> 4463.28
right

4451.9 --> 4466.339999999999
[Music]

4463.28 --> 4469.88
but also thinking about it now right so

4466.34 --> 4473.42
what theoretically could I have done

4469.88 --> 4476.2390000000005
before the 21st century

4473.42 --> 4478.9400000000005
to basically do this what I'm doing now

4476.239 --> 4481.599999999999
how could I have already done it like 20

4478.94 --> 4481.599999999999
years ago

4486.98 --> 4493.959999999999
like what

4488.6 --> 4493.96
what subject would I be tackling then

4496.34 --> 4501.92
I mean I I think if I started doing this

4499.4 --> 4502.69
20 years ago I probably would now be

4501.92 --> 4504.32
like

4502.69 --> 4507.199
[Music]

4504.32 --> 4509.239
I would have joined mugger Club too like

4507.199 --> 4512.919999999999
Alex Jones I would have been with all

4509.239 --> 4512.919999999999
those guys I would be like oh yeah

4514.46 --> 4520.659
I would have rolled into that

4517.04 --> 4520.659
because that was already ongoing

4522.44 --> 4528.739
but yeah it's it's because of Flat Earth

4526.34 --> 4529.76
Flat Earth was really the thing that was

4528.739 --> 4534.0199999999995
like

4529.76 --> 4536.06
finally a preponderance type subject

4534.02 --> 4537.320000000001
something so big

4536.06 --> 4540.8
[Music]

4537.32 --> 4542.96
that it's actually going to be somewhat

4540.8 --> 4545.06
challenging to figure it out

4542.96 --> 4549.02
it's actually going to be a something

4545.06 --> 4551.0
that's finally up to par to my

4549.02 --> 4554.0
intellectual standards

4551.0 --> 4556.94
to dig into especially because so many

4554.0 --> 4560.78
people are totally allergic to it well I

4556.94 --> 4563.719
have no such allergies I never did

4560.78 --> 4565.88
my issue was I can't handle the truth

4563.719 --> 4569.54
like I couldn't handle the truth that

4565.88 --> 4571.82
the entire world was being lied about

4569.54 --> 4574.159
and that people would do that and they

4571.82 --> 4576.62
wouldn't even realize that it was

4574.159 --> 4579.379999999999
basically a lie that would be reinforced

4576.62 --> 4581.239
like that Insight was the thing that I

4579.38 --> 4583.64
couldn't handle it wasn't that I

4581.239 --> 4585.799999999999
couldn't understand it how Flat Earth

4583.64 --> 4587.2390000000005
Works and all that that wasn't the

4585.8 --> 4588.4400000000005
problem I was like oh no I want to know

4587.239 --> 4591.259999999999
I wouldn't want more and more and more

4588.44 --> 4592.339999999999
how does that work like how does it

4591.26 --> 4595.900000000001
contained

4592.34 --> 4595.900000000001
how do you know there's a barrier

4597.92 --> 4603.679
I just couldn't handle dealing with it

4601.1 --> 4605.2390000000005
as in like oh now I'm really into this

4603.679 --> 4607.4
let's talk about this and then people

4605.239 --> 4609.86
are like ah you're a crazy person yeah

4607.4 --> 4611.78
you're out I'm kicking you out of the

4609.86 --> 4613.28
sports club or something I mean that

4611.78 --> 4616.0599999999995
would have happened

4613.28 --> 4616.0599999999995
I think

4618.38 --> 4624.7390000000005
so yeah in a way Flat Earth was the

4621.32 --> 4629.239
subject that really gave me

4624.739 --> 4630.62
the entry ground to do this to to start

4629.239 --> 4633.98
talking

4630.62 --> 4636.32
to be like a free-range teacher that's

4633.98 --> 4640.459999999999
completely as their own

4636.32 --> 4642.0199999999995
their own program like Unbound by

4640.46 --> 4644.719
by state

4642.02 --> 4647.5
so that I can literally teach whatever I

4644.719 --> 4647.5
I feel like

4648.44 --> 4655.58
and yeah Flat Earth really gave me that

4651.44 --> 4659.0
field a specialty to really dig into and

4655.58 --> 4661.96
thereby manifest myself into this sort

4659.0 --> 4661.96
of thing that I do

4662.9 --> 4667.299999999999
so thanks to Flat Earth I was able to do

4666.38 --> 4669.1990000000005
this

4667.3 --> 4671.900000000001
[Music]

4669.199 --> 4674.9
for not just flat Earth being flat but

4671.9 --> 4677.599999999999
like the the media

4674.9 --> 4680.239
opening the can of flatter

4677.6 --> 4683.179
in 2015.

4680.239 --> 4686.12
that has really opened it up the ground

4683.179 --> 4689.12
for me to be able to do this

4686.12 --> 4691.76
where before I was just freaking scared

4689.12 --> 4694.96
I was just scared of social persecution

4691.76 --> 4694.96
with everything

4698.9 --> 4702.739
but now that I've crossed the Flat Earth

4701.06 --> 4705.56
barrier

4702.739 --> 4708.0199999999995
well now it's like

4705.56 --> 4711.14
so Superior persecution you got to be

4708.02 --> 4714.860000000001
joking right I'm a flat earther

4711.14 --> 4718.84
the majority of the world probably

4714.86 --> 4718.839999999999
like stands against me

4718.88 --> 4723.02
so who gives a [ __ ] about social

4720.739 --> 4724.159
persecution anymore you got the worst of

4723.02 --> 4727.6990000000005
it anyway

4724.159 --> 4730.699
so I can just be myself now without fear

4727.699 --> 4732.86
of social persecution stopping me

4730.699 --> 4734.96
it's like oh I might say something that

4732.86 --> 4736.33
will make everybody hate me dude I'm a

4734.96 --> 4739.399
flat earther

4736.33 --> 4739.399
[Music]

4739.64 --> 4746.08
and not just that I'm not just a flat

4742.46 --> 4746.08
earther I'm also kind of

4749.0 --> 4754.46
on top of that

4751.94 --> 4756.919999999999
vicious in thought at least I've never

4754.46 --> 4760.159
actually heard anybody

4756.92 --> 4763.159
that I can prove

4760.159 --> 4765.259999999999
but I am definitely vicious on top of

4763.159 --> 4768.139999999999
also being a flat earther so it's like

4765.26 --> 4771.1990000000005
oh social persecution well yeah sure

4768.14 --> 4771.1990000000005
[Music]

4774.56 --> 4780.02
and despite all this nobody's

4776.78 --> 4783.759999999999
persecuting me by the way nobody besides

4780.02 --> 4783.76
trolls and [ __ ] nobody

4784.699 --> 4790.219
everybody that I talk to like at

4788.179 --> 4792.62
supermarket or at the coffee shop they

4790.219 --> 4795.38
all think I'm a cool dude

4792.62 --> 4796.28
and and and they mean it like I can feel

4795.38 --> 4798.5
that

4796.28 --> 4800.92
so it's like and they know I'm a flat

4798.5 --> 4800.92
earther

4801.32 --> 4805.94
they really don't mind

4803.9 --> 4808.5199999999995
but it's probably because I'm not like

4805.94 --> 4811.4
oh did you hear this about Flat Earth

4808.52 --> 4813.860000000001
like I'm not like everybody that I meet

4811.4 --> 4816.62
I don't just start blabbering on about

4813.86 --> 4818.659
Flat Earth every [ __ ] time

4816.62 --> 4820.82
because then people would probably get

4818.659 --> 4823.78
sick of me

4820.82 --> 4823.78
I don't do that

4825.8 --> 4829.820000000001
there are millions now if he is

4828.32 --> 4833.0
mainstream

4829.82 --> 4835.759999999999
it's still subculture Derek

4833.0 --> 4838.219
it's not mainstream

4835.76 --> 4841.1
if it was mainstream then the majority

4838.219 --> 4842.54
of people would openly come up they're

4841.1 --> 4845.4800000000005
not

4842.54 --> 4849.739
it's just a subculture now

4845.48 --> 4852.44
it's not super Niche it's not super rare

4849.739 --> 4855.259999999999
it's not only a couple of isolated

4852.44 --> 4857.12
cookie conspiracy theories so it's a

4855.26 --> 4859.219
subculture now

4857.12 --> 4863.84
[Music]

4859.219 --> 4867.8
right just like Gothic was a subculture

4863.84 --> 4870.67
they were like uh millions of them

4867.8 --> 4871.76
millions of Gothic people

4870.67 --> 4874.159
[Music]

4871.76 --> 4875.719
yeah and wave Gothic Trafford alone

4874.159 --> 4877.28
there would be like hundreds of

4875.719 --> 4881.96
thousands of them

4877.28 --> 4885.0199999999995
so yeah not super isolated individuals

4881.96 --> 4889.46
it is a subculture it's a whole group of

4885.02 --> 4892.46
people that follow the same style

4889.46 --> 4894.5
and flat earthers like that are now a

4892.46 --> 4896.42
subculture it's no longer the isolated

4894.5 --> 4898.699
cookie conspiracy theories no it's an

4896.42 --> 4902.2390000000005
entire subculture

4898.699 --> 4903.678999999999
it's not main culture though it is still

4902.239 --> 4906.5599999999995

4903.679 --> 4909.32
who was main culture then the television

Earth [ __ ] in your face then it's

4911.659 --> 4915.92

4915.92 --> 4921.369
[Music]

4935.54 --> 4939.08

4937.52 --> 4942.56
that's separate

people that are into Fe

4942.56 --> 4948.8

4946.04 --> 4951.679
that are into it as in people that like

4948.8 --> 4954.56
to know about the arguments people that

4951.679 --> 4956.84
like to see the the duking it out of

4954.56 --> 4958.1
flat earthers with anti-flat earthers to

4956.84 --> 4960.26
see how much of a mess they're gonna

4958.1 --> 4963.08
make out of it right

4960.26 --> 4965.360000000001
that's a subculture

4963.08 --> 4967.28
yes the Earth is flat of course but

4965.36 --> 4969.38
there's people that they're like

4967.28 --> 4971.3
yeah if it's flat yeah sure it's in the

4969.38 --> 4973.219
Bible and they'll just leave it like

4971.3 --> 4975.4400000000005
that and they're like not interested in

4973.219 --> 4977.179
talking about it okay those aren't flat

4975.44 --> 4979.339999999999

4977.179 --> 4982.64
flat they're not into it though

I worry about it no but I'm sure it's

[ __ ] Vatican Globe tart

it's the glove tarts

they're making moves

5199.78 --> 5205.54
I told you that there would come a war

5202.42 --> 5207.34
like with Iran and this is this sound

5205.54 --> 5209.62
all sounds like the build-up of it it's

5207.34 --> 5211.8
like a cultural attack

5209.62 --> 5211.8
foreign

5228.76 --> 5233.5
so yeah Tara I mean you're going to

5231.04 --> 5235.179
realize that Islam is probably the

5233.5 --> 5237.82
biggest religion in the world right now

5235.179 --> 5239.9800000000005
there's always going to be millions of

5237.82 --> 5242.259999999999
people getting into it and millions of

5239.98 --> 5244.659
people leaving so

5242.26 --> 5248.1990000000005
I don't know if you've got that in

5244.659 --> 5252.94
proper perspective the supposed movement

5248.199 --> 5258.04
yeah but uh I'm serious like Islam is

5252.94 --> 5260.5
not dying it's not decreasing

5258.04 --> 5263.32
it's the biggest religion the world has

5260.5 --> 5266.08
ever seen it's everywhere

5263.32 --> 5268.299999999999
and I used to be really scared because

5266.08 --> 5271.6
all they're going to get my freedom

5268.3 --> 5273.400000000001

5274.78 --> 5281.159
I know that's not true now that's not

5277.06 --> 5284.620000000001
how it works at all and I also know that

5281.159 --> 5287.5
extreme Muslims right they're not

5284.62 --> 5289.0599999999995
Muslims they're Grappler Muslims and a

5287.5 --> 5291.699
lot of them are actually controlled

5289.06 --> 5295.360000000001
opposition organizations

5291.699 --> 5298.419999999999
of a specific origin

5295.36 --> 5302.94
that are just there to to create

5298.42 --> 5302.9400000000005
friction and war with Islam

5304.36 --> 5310.42
and to like promote Savage Behavior

5307.44 --> 5313.0
among the idiots

5310.42 --> 5314.38
that happen to classify themselves as

5313.0 --> 5316.719
Islamic

5314.38 --> 5318.159000000001
like the people that are like trashing

5316.719 --> 5322.12
France

5318.159 --> 5323.62
yeah none of that actually abides to act

5322.12 --> 5327.42
to real

5323.62 --> 5327.42
Islamic law at all

5328.9 --> 5333.929999999999
like writing and burning everything is

5332.139 --> 5339.34
not Islam

5333.93 --> 5340.780000000001
[Music]

5339.34 --> 5342.82
right

5340.78 --> 5345.04
so there's

5342.82 --> 5347.199
Islam Grapplers and they're being

5345.04 --> 5351.46
promoted they're being funded by the

5347.199 --> 5355.419999999999
West officially even like the whole

5351.46 --> 5358.4800000000005
serious situation isil all that that was

5355.42 --> 5360.58
all freaking Western funded guys all of

5358.48 --> 5363.04
it completely

5360.58 --> 5365.86
complete package funding it was

5363.04 --> 5368.92
literally conjured

5365.86 --> 5372.4
was created extremists

5368.92 --> 5374.1990000000005
were provided money and weapons to do

5372.4 --> 5375.219999999999
their thing

5374.199 --> 5393.12
by the West

5375.22 --> 5395.01
[Music]

5393.12 --> 5399.669
shut the [ __ ] up there

5395.01 --> 5399.669
[Music]

5401.32 --> 5404.82
same with Ukraine yes

5409.239 --> 5413.32
yeah

5410.679 --> 5416.26
New World Order they create the Islamic

5413.32 --> 5418.9
terrorists they create

5416.26 --> 5420.39
the Nazi

5418.9 --> 5422.138999999999
military

5420.39 --> 5425.38
[Music]

5422.139 --> 5428.02
and then they use that created opponent

5425.38 --> 5430.3
to attack the West

5428.02 --> 5432.820000000001
and gain more power

5430.3 --> 5437.08
did destabilize everything and force

5432.82 --> 5439.659
everybody to get stuck in wars and

5437.08 --> 5443.86
setups that are inflexible so that they

5439.659 --> 5443.86
can be maximally exploited

5444.4 --> 5450.438999999999
that's what it does

5446.57 --> 5450.438999999999
[Music]

5452.08 --> 5454.44
yeah

5454.96 --> 5460.42
I mean creating War means an opera

5458.5 --> 5464.699
creating an opportunity for lots of

5460.42 --> 5464.6990000000005
organ harvesting that's what that means

5465.82 --> 5470.44
that's what they do

5468.28 --> 5472.739
that's why they do it it's part of the

5470.44 --> 5476.799999999999
reason it's like oh

5472.739 --> 5480.339999999999
the demand for organs is getting higher

5476.8 --> 5481.96
okay well let's start a war then

5480.34 --> 5484.3
yeah

5481.96 --> 5487.0
you think that might be exaggerated well

5484.3 --> 5489.360000000001
guess again that is pretty much how that

5487.0 --> 5489.36
goes

5492.28 --> 5496.719
I mean people are nothing but

5494.56 --> 5500.080000000001
commodities

5496.719 --> 5502.659
to them to those people that decide to

5500.08 --> 5504.88
do this they don't care they'll

5502.659 --> 5507.219
Slaughter you they'll blow you up

5504.88 --> 5509.5
they'll let you be tortured they'll let

5507.219 --> 5511.86
you starve to death they don't give a

5509.5 --> 5511.86
[ __ ]

5512.56 --> 5518.46
now piss on your Graves they don't give

5515.92 --> 5518.46
a [ __ ]

5518.77 --> 5523.540000000001
[Music]

5521.02 --> 5525.13
they're just there to make money and to

5523.54 --> 5527.32
take away power

5525.13 --> 5530.68
[Music]

5527.32 --> 5545.619
from other people that's what they do

5530.68 --> 5545.619000000001
[Music]

5548.44 --> 5553.678999999999
they want one unified religion yeah

5550.78 --> 5553.679
they're retards

5563.32 --> 5568.84
Americans have their secret labs in

5565.42 --> 5571.07
Ukraine yeah not for long though

5568.84 --> 5577.29
most of them have already been conquered

5571.07 --> 5577.29
[Music]

5579.6 --> 5582.659000000001
thank you

5585.699 --> 5593.08
you know I'm just I feel lucky to know

5589.32 --> 5594.88
with absolute certainty absolute

5593.08 --> 5597.88
certainty

5594.88 --> 5600.639
that there is no threat whatsoever

5597.88 --> 5602.38
from those bio Labs from any bio lab for

5600.639 --> 5605.08
that matter the only threat that you'll

5602.38 --> 5606.400000000001
ever get from one of those bio Labs is

5605.08 --> 5609.76
poison

5606.4 --> 5611.92
that you could shoot in your body and

5609.76 --> 5615.34
then it [ __ ] you up yeah

5611.92 --> 5619.54
that's the only danger it's the only

5615.34 --> 5622.12
danger the only Danger

5619.54 --> 5625.179
something that can be put in a syringe

5622.12 --> 5626.8
and injected in you that's the only

5625.179 --> 5629.639
Danger

5626.8 --> 5632.26
from those via Labs do you understand

5629.639 --> 5635.5
there's no other

5632.26 --> 5636.639
possible Calamity that can come forth

5635.5 --> 5639.4
from it

5636.639 --> 5641.679
don't worry the only thing you need to

5639.4 --> 5644.5
worry about is [ __ ] that they'll try to

5641.679 --> 5646.3
force make you put in your own body

5644.5 --> 5648.58
because they can't actually force it

5646.3 --> 5650.320000000001
somebody actually tries to force it you

5648.58 --> 5652.48
literally have carte blanched to

5650.32 --> 5654.46
literally execute them on the spot

5652.48 --> 5658.379999999999
yeah

5654.46 --> 5658.38
but you didn't really know that

5658.39 --> 5661.439
[Music]

5663.04 --> 5666.96
it's part of the reason why I stated

5664.78 --> 5670.599999999999
that a whole bunch of times

5666.96 --> 5674.02
2020 and 21.

5670.6 --> 5674.860000000001
but yeah you forced me then you die I

5674.02 --> 5677.26
will

5674.86 --> 5678.46
then kill you and make sure that you are

5677.26 --> 5681.820000000001
dead

5678.46 --> 5683.9800000000005
you try and force that [ __ ] in me I will

5681.82 --> 5685.0
kill you and ensure that you are dead

5683.98 --> 5687.5199999999995
then

5685.0 --> 5689.98
right they're not forcing it they can't

5687.52 --> 5692.26
actually do it if they do that it'll be

5689.98 --> 5694.919999999999
overall very quickly

5692.26 --> 5699.42
because that's a line you can't cross

5694.92 --> 5703.0
without immediately initiating like

5699.42 --> 5706.179
post-world War II mechanisms

5703.0 --> 5709.42
so what they can do instead is literally

5706.179 --> 5711.58
lure people in and then say Oh you want

5709.42 --> 5713.38
to keep these trinkets take the shot

5711.58 --> 5716.26
you want to keep your special payment

5713.38 --> 5719.32
payment take the shot like that's how

5716.26 --> 5721.860000000001
they do it and so many [ __ ] people

5719.32 --> 5721.86
bought it

5721.96 --> 5727.3
and in my opinion I am sorry it's it is

5725.139 --> 5729.34
all still tragic but they [ __ ]

5727.3 --> 5732.1
deserve everything that comes to them

5729.34 --> 5734.28
including death

5732.1 --> 5734.280000000001
foreign

5734.639 --> 5740.86
that they didn't deserve is to be

5738.219 --> 5744.82
separated from your dying family like

5740.86 --> 5747.759999999999
that's the part that's just like

5744.82 --> 5749.32
there's no karmic justification for that

5747.76 --> 5751.179
at all

5749.32 --> 5752.799999999999
it's like you must take a shot or you

5751.179 --> 5753.9400000000005
can't see your own dying mother like

5752.8 --> 5756.52
that

5753.94 --> 5759.04
that is the point where they absolutely

5756.52 --> 5761.5
should all be in jail those people that

5759.04 --> 5762.94
that push that but everything else it's

5761.5 --> 5765.34
like yeah

5762.94 --> 5767.98
yeah oh you thought you could just have

5765.34 --> 5771.76
all that no no you can't

5767.98 --> 5774.339999999999
you don't have the right to anything you

5771.76 --> 5777.52
see you don't have the right to your

5774.34 --> 5782.26
high paying job you don't have the right

5777.52 --> 5785.679
to be part of anything or any place

5782.26 --> 5787.900000000001
yeah you don't have that right at all

5785.679 --> 5788.6990000000005
you just have a contract and if the

5787.9 --> 5791.08
person

5788.699 --> 5793.54
decides that

5791.08 --> 5795.34
you do Russian Roulette right now or

5793.54 --> 5798.639
you're fired

5795.34 --> 5800.92
then it's their [ __ ] right to do so

5798.639 --> 5803.08
although you can't legally

5800.92 --> 5805.42
do that specifically with Russian

5803.08 --> 5808.0599999999995
Roulette but you know what I mean

5805.42 --> 5810.76
metaphorically in this case like yeah

5808.06 --> 5815.400000000001
that's what they did and people bought

5810.76 --> 5815.400000000001
it and now they're dying or dead

5818.92 --> 5821.92
foreign

5822.719 --> 5827.8
can be forced

5825.1 --> 5830.02
as soon as somebody's taking that is

5827.8 --> 5831.639
being forced to take it against their

5830.02 --> 5834.88
will

5831.639 --> 5838.86
there's like literally a death warrant

5834.88 --> 5838.86
on those people that did that

5839.32 --> 5844.99
like

5841.6 --> 5846.159000000001
right by Nuremberg Nuremberg standards

5844.99 --> 5849.4
[Music]

5846.159 --> 5851.339999999999
Nuremberg standards you force that

5849.4 --> 5852.4
your life is forfeit

5851.34 --> 5854.8
[Music]

5852.4 --> 5856.599999999999
and there have been places I think like

5854.8 --> 5859.54
in Australia where they actually did do

5856.6 --> 5861.9400000000005
that they just forced it

5859.54 --> 5864.28
they forced those people that forced it

5861.94 --> 5866.199
those Georgie cops or whatever they

5864.28 --> 5868.04
thought they were doing they should all

5866.199 --> 5871.54
get the death penalty

5868.04 --> 5874.719
[Music]

5871.54 --> 5878.32
and not like as the ultimate as bad as

5874.719 --> 5880.719
it no no they should default default no

5878.32 --> 5883.719
mercy death penalty

5880.719 --> 5886.12
do Force anybody to take a shot like

5883.719 --> 5887.92
that death penalty

5886.12 --> 5890.92
unconditional

5887.92 --> 5893.38
[Music]

5890.92 --> 5896.64
yeah doesn't matter if they're a [ __ ]

5893.38 --> 5897.82
doesn't matter if they're an old person

5896.64 --> 5900.46
[Music]

5897.82 --> 5902.5
that were expecting to die within 10

5900.46 --> 5905.02
years anyway it doesn't matter

5902.5 --> 5907.42
you force anybody

5905.02 --> 5908.639
to take that against their will death

5907.42 --> 5910.9400000000005
penalty

5908.639 --> 5914.139
and nothing less

5910.94 --> 5916.419999999999
[Music]

5914.139 --> 5918.46
Nuremberg standard

5916.42 --> 5922.08
you can't force it

5918.46 --> 5926.139
you can ruin somebody's life completely

5922.08 --> 5927.58
and then seduce them to take it to solve

5926.139 --> 5931.719
all that

5927.58 --> 5934.26
but you can never actually Force anybody

5931.719 --> 5940.5
to take it against their will if you do

5934.26 --> 5940.5
death penalty and nothing less

5941.1 --> 5944.169000000001
[Music]

5945.1 --> 5948.9400000000005
right

5946.42 --> 5951.54
on that harsh note though I am gonna

5948.94 --> 5951.54
round out

5952.239 --> 5956.32
prison they couldn't Force yeah that's

5954.1 --> 5958.900000000001
right because if they did they would

5956.32 --> 5960.219
immediately be marked for a death

5958.9 --> 5963.28
penalty

5960.219 --> 5965.199
by Nuremberg standard and that's why I

5963.28 --> 5967.36
keep saying that every time it comes up

5965.199 --> 5970.919999999999
you force me I will kill you I will

5967.36 --> 5970.92
ensure that you are dead

5972.88 --> 5977.86
right so anyway

5975.639 --> 5981.719
time has flown

5977.86 --> 5981.719
it's a slightly short show

5981.88 --> 5988.900000000001
I see very cute yeah I am yes on people

5986.139 --> 5991.12
that deserve it very much

5988.9 --> 5993.04
I I regularly have fantasies of

5991.12 --> 5994.32
literally chopping them up with with

5993.04 --> 5995.44
sharp blades

5994.32 --> 5996.82
[Music]

5995.44 --> 6000.36
that's right

5996.82 --> 6003.0
because I'm [ __ ] sick of people being

6000.36 --> 6004.5599999999995
able to do [ __ ] up [ __ ] out there and

6003.0 --> 6007.62
getting away with it and having an

6004.56 --> 6012.320000000001
entire system that specifically designed

6007.62 --> 6012.32
for them to get away with crime

6012.44 --> 6018.239
it's not even on the preference in group

6015.0 --> 6020.82
it's just Universal like laws to ensure

6018.239 --> 6024.599999999999
that people get away with crime

6020.82 --> 6027.12
and that's that makes me

6024.6 --> 6031.679
kind of vicious

6027.12 --> 6035.5199999999995
makes me really like this grass needs to

6031.679 --> 6038.04
be moan it really needs to be mowed

6035.52 --> 6041.219
that's my attitude

6038.04 --> 6043.92
right so anyway thanks everyone for

6041.219 --> 6045.78
coming I hope you like this show if you
