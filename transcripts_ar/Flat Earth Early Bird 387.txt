189.129 --> 197.29
it's kind of grayish rainy sometimes not

193.93 --> 201.549
so ready but I went through that through

197.29 --> 204.54899999999998
the rain you can hear it and yeah bumped

201.549 --> 207.70000000000002
into two people from two very young

204.549 --> 211.68
people standing outside of the outside

207.7 --> 216.48899999999998
of the supermarket for Greenpeace and

211.68 --> 220.69
yeah there was a really cute girl among

216.489 --> 222.94
them and she she really wanted a

220.69 --> 226.629
conversation so I gave everyone for 45

222.94 --> 230.139
minutes and I even got to the point in

226.629 --> 233.319
the dropping Flat Earth at the end yeah

230.139 --> 235.979
and yeah maybe she'll watch my show she

233.319 --> 239.19899999999998
certainly seemed to be interested in

235.979 --> 242.169
talking a lot about environment also and

239.199 --> 244.989
like the palm oil situation in Brazil

242.169 --> 248.579
and yeah as everybody though I have very

244.989 --> 254.26
elaborate insights and views on that and

248.579 --> 256.51
she was very interested so yeah that was

254.26 --> 259.26
nice and yeah that could also cause me

256.51 --> 259.26
to be kind of late

261.05 --> 268.38
so yeah very busy chat today this Friday

367.96 --> 371.37
matrix media

380.64 --> 389.84999999999997
so yeah yesterday was again very late

384.46 --> 389.84999999999997
night also and I caught a bit of

393.81 --> 400.23
[Music]

395.13 --> 402.45
residence with me and names and recently

400.23 --> 406.72
[Music]

402.45 --> 410.67
same guy from yesterday night I watched

406.72 --> 410.67
it again Christian Channel

418.82 --> 424.29
yeah and my liked videos list doesn't

422.43 --> 427.44
really help me either since it seems to

424.29 --> 433.95000000000005
be extremely selective as to what it

427.44 --> 436.13
actually shows me it sucks the

433.95 --> 439.17
originally the liked list just showed

436.13 --> 441.33
seriously a list of everything that I've

439.17 --> 444.56
liked and now it just shows it off a few

441.33 --> 444.56
videos it's so annoying

451.73 --> 464.40000000000003
Zhen Garcia that's it right and that was

460.53 --> 466.5
interesting also hanging around a lot on

464.4 --> 470.17999999999995
D life

466.5 --> 475.38
I caught lift to fail life and I caught

470.18 --> 477.27
Owen Benjamin lifted it was later that's

475.38 --> 481.62
some good interactions and chat with him

477.27 --> 489.09
as well and he's a great guy

481.62 --> 489.57
oh yeah also on recommendation of Owen

489.09 --> 492.35999999999996
Benjamin

489.57 --> 494.3
I watched what's his name again I supp

492.36 --> 499.77000000000004
to his channel this time

494.3 --> 502.76
yeah the dark stream Fox News is it a

499.77 --> 502.76
fox day right

507.34 --> 512.98
and yeah that was that was interesting

509.92 --> 515.13
he has a very different condensed way of

512.98 --> 518.52
explaining things and it is fascinating

515.13 --> 522.58
I'm noticing more and more that I'm just

518.52 --> 525.4
trying to study people like how do they

522.58 --> 528.19
do it what I noticed about well all of

525.4 --> 531.16
these guys in contrast to myself is how

528.19 --> 533.22
fluid they are they constantly keep on

531.16 --> 535.75
talking and they do interact with chat

533.22 --> 540.1
but they don't have any silent moments

535.75 --> 546.34
and I do now on the other hand that is

540.1 --> 549.25
also because I try to dig up improvised

546.34 --> 551.38
thoughts a lot so that maybe that is the

549.25 --> 554.2
difference I am not much of a pre

551.38 --> 555.97
programmer which would be better you

554.2 --> 559.11
know even the lists with subjects but

555.97 --> 563.23
sometimes it just doesn't work with me

559.11 --> 568.17
but it's it's good to study good to

563.23 --> 568.1700000000001
study these people and and their ideas

570.45 --> 576.36
at least I think so I think it's very

573.19 --> 576.36
interesting to do that

582.06 --> 590.43
right yeah yesterday in the dark stream

584.76 --> 592.92
it was about Britain demanding her exit

590.43 --> 595.65
and about like he when he did some real

592.92 --> 596.5799999999999
research and that like these people do

595.65 --> 602.04
homework

596.58 --> 604.8000000000001
it's just tangible I should do some

602.04 --> 607.8
homework myself sometime but I don't

604.8 --> 611.2199999999999
know this is I think they've gone with

607.8 --> 613.14
improvisation more and it always has

611.22 --> 624.5400000000001
worked very well with me so it's kind of

613.14 --> 627.6899999999999
tough to change it around but yeah

624.54 --> 629.28
apparently there's a big issue going on

627.69 --> 630.0600000000001
in Britain and yeah I kind of followed

629.28 --> 633.99
it myself

630.06 --> 641.91
although vfvf through the channel what's

633.99 --> 644.84
it called in L LBC right but yeah that's

641.91 --> 647.85
mostly just politician interviews oh

644.84 --> 651.39
yeah they of course don't give a really

647.85 --> 655.35
good oversight out of it oh and I

651.39 --> 658.5
thought that fox days hangout yesterday

655.35 --> 664.41
was extremely informative also showing

658.5 --> 667.56
that well the potential growing near the

664.41 --> 672.78
end of the original British Empire set

667.56 --> 675.0
up and that while he says that there's

672.78 --> 679.05
likelihood that Scotland and England

675.0 --> 681.87
will break away from one another because

679.05 --> 686.51
of the yeah where the political

681.87 --> 686.51
situation is inevitably going as it were

693.66 --> 702.0899999999999
huh right the Me's kang yeah you know in

698.46 --> 704.0400000000001
a way it's I guess for me it is a the

702.09 --> 708.0
grass is greener on the other side kind

704.04 --> 708.81
of thing so I really appreciate what I

708.0 --> 711.6
can do

708.81 --> 714.66
although sometimes just you know it has

711.6 --> 717.89
ups and downs and it does look kind of

714.66 --> 721.23
bad when the down is there it's just I

717.89 --> 723.51
can't really get around it try to be as

721.23 --> 727.83
eloquent overall and as explanatory as I

723.51 --> 729.78
can but I do appreciate it but yeah when

727.83 --> 732.12
you then see people that really study

729.78 --> 734.28
carefully then even though at times it

732.12 --> 736.2
may seem like their improvisation skills

734.28 --> 738.12
may be somewhat lacking compared to mine

736.2 --> 740.5500000000001
I don't care about that

738.12 --> 744.45
because I just noticed what they do so

740.55 --> 746.9399999999999
well that I am not so good at and then I

744.45 --> 752.4300000000001
get kind of jealous it's like oh I wish

746.94 --> 754.23
I I was that good so it's yeah I guess

752.43 --> 757.2199999999999
agree a grass is greener on the other

754.23 --> 757.22
side kind of thing

773.769 --> 778.42
anyway let's see what you guys are

775.759 --> 778.42
talking about

793.9 --> 805.17
no green grass here my cork hmm

810.09 --> 814.5600000000001
alright okay I understand that Robin

813.06 --> 817.3199999999999
Stanley it like you have much more

814.56 --> 819.8399999999999
skills available to you when you talk

817.32 --> 822.1500000000001
face-to-face do you have the same thing

819.84 --> 825.3000000000001
like when you call somebody up on skype

822.15 --> 830.52
with a video chat or does that already

825.3 --> 833.13
help you a lot because video chat to me

830.52 --> 835.52
is very different than just text

833.13 --> 835.52
chatting

841.76 --> 846.4399999999999
yeah and with text chatting like timing

844.399 --> 849.32
is everything but when you're

846.44 --> 855.1300000000001
communicating face-to-face and really

849.32 --> 858.35
letting that taking literally the time

855.13 --> 861.97
for the voice to put put it out in a

858.35 --> 864.1990000000001
certain rhythm then it's more it

861.97 --> 868.6990000000001
communication really more becomes like a

864.199 --> 870.5889999999999
a play you do together you feel the

868.699 --> 872.54
directions and then you go with it or

870.589 --> 875.6
you make it deflect it's like a dance

872.54 --> 877.9699999999999
it's something extra as what you have

875.6 --> 880.6700000000001
with chat when in chat timing is just

877.97 --> 883.4300000000001
everything and being clear as possible

880.67 --> 886.699
and in the words and all that what

883.43 --> 890.6899999999999
communication face-to-face is more like

886.699 --> 892.449
a dance and for me I've said many times

890.69 --> 895.1
for me it's very tough to kind of like

892.449 --> 897.529
what is it being an icebreaker

895.1 --> 899.72
stepping up to somebody starting a

897.529 --> 903.709
conversation that's like very tough for

899.72 --> 906.5
me but if somebody seems interested in

903.709 --> 909.8
having a conversation with me then I can

906.5 --> 912.41
read those signs very clearly and then

909.8 --> 915.2299999999999
initiating the conversation is just pure

912.41 --> 917.81
nature it's just there's no problem

915.23 --> 921.35
whatsoever because the connection is

917.81 --> 925.2199999999999
there for me to tap into and then get it

921.35 --> 933.78
all rolling it's so easy once you get

925.22 --> 935.8100000000001
that connection a great icebreaker what

933.78 --> 935.81
Oh

939.87 --> 948.47
oh wow Thank You Julie Oh Pavan I'll

942.78 --> 948.47
check it out if Erica really use it

955.13 --> 960.53
you know I I don't like to go the the

958.52 --> 963.92
beggars route again oh wow Thank You

960.53 --> 966.11
Giulio Pavan yeah 20 euros thank you so

963.92 --> 970.49
much that'll be so that'll be a lot of

966.11 --> 973.94
help because I can't really use it you

970.49 --> 977.42
know my original sources that I used to

973.94 --> 980.3000000000001
lean on especially first half of this

977.42 --> 984.26
year and before like they're all on on

980.3 --> 987.14
hold there's nothing I can get there by

984.26 --> 995.21
my dad's almost yeah um it's pretty much

987.14 --> 997.46
in the same situation in a way although

995.21 --> 1000.46
again the future still does look

997.46 --> 1007.5400000000001
promising but for now it's just very

1000.46 --> 1010.69
tough to get around what do you think

1007.54 --> 1016.42
this is this it really is my profession

1010.69 --> 1023.35
what I do and even if I'm not making

1016.42 --> 1029.1889999999999
money out of it you know anyway thank

1023.35 --> 1029.189
you thank you a lot for that

1033.9 --> 1044.6200000000001
now really baits 60 RMC my presenting my

1039.339 --> 1047.049
presentation has improved 100% okay so

1044.62 --> 1055.27
does that meet in that I'm twice as good

1047.049 --> 1057.8799999999999
or does that mean that I used to be

1055.27 --> 1060.4
absolutely abysmal and that I'm now just

1057.88 --> 1068.71
perfectly fine is a matter of how you

1060.4 --> 1072.97
view the percentages with that you

1068.71 --> 1077.32
probably mean the first thank you I try

1072.97 --> 1080.95
to do my best and sometimes I get a lot

1077.32 --> 1085.08
of inner friction against that and I

1080.95 --> 1085.0800000000002
have to like really tired days as well

1087.67 --> 1091.929
[Music]

1089.669 --> 1094.24
but I don't always see it coming you

1091.929 --> 1096.3400000000001
know I think that a lot of people out

1094.24 --> 1100.39
there that also do this and they have

1096.34 --> 1104.01
jobs and they have a better society of

1100.39 --> 1108.8200000000002
foundation I think in many ways than me

1104.01 --> 1111.19
and they'll know much better ahead of

1108.82 --> 1113.8899999999999
time because of having a more experience

1111.19 --> 1116.47
with work they'll have more intuition to

1113.89 --> 1117.94
see coming like if they're going to be

1116.47 --> 1122.559
in a bad mood or something for me

1117.94 --> 1124.99
sometimes it's it's it seems tough to

1122.559 --> 1128.4089999999999
figure it out I can just notice like oh

1124.99 --> 1132.789
I seem to be somewhat shaky but that can

1128.409 --> 1134.5
turn into good things as well so I don't

1132.789 --> 1136.6299999999999
really know ahead of time it's just like

1134.5 --> 1139.33
okay this is gonna be like a really nice

1136.63 --> 1142.0800000000002
smooth day or I am super strong and it's

1139.33 --> 1146.1399999999999
going to be fluid or it's gonna be okay

1142.08 --> 1148.6899999999998
well I might I might get some really

1146.14 --> 1151.69
interesting things out there and deeper

1148.69 --> 1153.73
thoughts or I could it could shoot wrong

1151.69 --> 1156.789
and I can start to feel really bad about

1153.73 --> 1159.6
myself and then get frustrated I don't

1156.789 --> 1159.6
really know at a time

1161.53 --> 1167.54
so that is kind of what I designated as

1164.87 --> 1170.03
feeble because it feels like their

1167.54 --> 1172.94
normal balance for me it suddenly

1170.03 --> 1174.53
becomes less balanced so it's I don't

1172.94 --> 1180.77
know it could go one way or the other

1174.53 --> 1183.2
then in such times and it's a little

1180.77 --> 1190.6
tough to maneuver where it's gonna end

1183.2 --> 1194.66
up hmm Wow

1190.6 --> 1197.5
okay baits are a 60 RMC I'm not gonna

1194.66 --> 1201.17
argue against that

1197.5 --> 1206.51
no Thank You Marco green I do pride my

1201.17 --> 1209.3000000000002
my English skills it's not perfect and

1206.51 --> 1212.45
there seem to be these long-term little

1209.3 --> 1215.12
weird mistakes are in my spelling in

1212.45 --> 1216.56
chat that I just don't see and other

1215.12 --> 1218.54
people might not see as well but they

1216.56 --> 1220.52
are probably wrong I even have that in

1218.54 --> 1224.18
Dutch it's like things that I just get

1220.52 --> 1227.6299999999999
wrong and I don't nobody points me at it

1224.18 --> 1230.48
I used to get very strict guidance in my

1227.63 --> 1233.2700000000002
language from my parents like I had to

1230.48 --> 1237.8
articulate everything correctly in Dutch

1233.27 --> 1240.02
was very annoying and had to spell

1237.8 --> 1242.3
everything right because I was kind of

1240.02 --> 1244.79
sloppy you know I was always a dreamer I

1242.3 --> 1249.3799999999999
was just look up put it all out there

1244.79 --> 1251.99
and like wasn't that great at getting

1249.38 --> 1257.8600000000001
the spelling correct it was kind of sort

1251.99 --> 1260.8700000000001
of again slightly dyslexic but not full

1257.86 --> 1262.8799999999999
so they really ramped the spelling and

1260.87 --> 1265.82
the correct pronunciations and the

1262.88 --> 1268.6100000000001
understanding the etymology of language

1265.82 --> 1271.82
they ran that into me and it's get

1268.61 --> 1274.25
paying off that did that is what this is

1271.82 --> 1276.62
I think I got training when I was very

1274.25 --> 1277.49
young and this is the result I'm very

1276.62 --> 1279.32
happy about that

1277.49 --> 1281.57
even though was kind of annoying at

1279.32 --> 1285.08
times because I just want to talk about

1281.57 --> 1289.22
my ideas and no guys did right you gotta

1285.08 --> 1291.9499999999998
say it right you gotta you know

1289.22 --> 1294.74
hmm and my brother tried dead with me in

1291.95 --> 1300.29
the scientific method even back in the

1294.74 --> 1302.57
day and then when he tried to confront

1300.29 --> 1305.03
me with quantum mechanics because I said

1302.57 --> 1307.7
no I want to get it please explain in

1305.03 --> 1311.1499999999999
quantum mechanics I was 17 or something

1307.7 --> 1313.79
well maybe 16 and he was like nah

1311.15 --> 1317.5700000000002
there's no way yeah yeah you're too

1313.79 --> 1319.55
stupid you're you're too Arwen like he's

1317.57 --> 1321.62
my big brother 7 years older and there

1319.55 --> 1325.76
was it was probably a red ride because I

1321.62 --> 1327.4699999999998
was much more foolish than him I was

1325.76 --> 1332.15
very smart but I was also kind of

1327.47 --> 1334.33
foolish and a little bit reckless so he

1332.15 --> 1337.01
tried to explain and then yeah

1334.33 --> 1340.34
Einstein I got confronted with Einstein

1337.01 --> 1343.28
and I immediately fell into the trap

1340.34 --> 1347.33
math is reality I didn't understand it I

1343.28 --> 1349.22
didn't understand that that that just

1347.33 --> 1350.8999999999999
because something in math works it

1349.22 --> 1353.1200000000001
doesn't mean it's real my brother kind

1350.9 --> 1354.95
of got that and I didn't and it

1353.12 --> 1356.3899999999999
frustrated him to no end and that's

1354.95 --> 1360.2
after that point he just said yeah I

1356.39 --> 1361.88
don't wanna you're gonna have to figure

1360.2 --> 1362.3
it out for yourself you're not listening

1361.88 --> 1365.42
to me

1362.3 --> 1373.07
and I was super disappointed but yeah

1365.42 --> 1376.18
that that is what that was that's like

1373.07 --> 1376.1799999999998
23 years ago

1419.08 --> 1425.4399999999998
oh sorry mark colored I I'm not trying

1423.369 --> 1427.2099999999998
I'm getting a lot of compliments in chat

1425.44 --> 1428.8300000000002
I thank you very much it's just that

1427.21 --> 1431.169
there's a lot of people addressing me

1428.83 --> 1431.59
and I was in the middle of the train of

1431.169 --> 1433.72
thought

1431.59 --> 1436.35
thank you very much I really appreciate

1433.72 --> 1436.3500000000001
it

1450.48 --> 1461.22
okay Marco Crean what I I don't really

1457.23 --> 1467.28
bring up the Bible at Nathan's side like

1461.22 --> 1470.88
it comes up and then I have something to

1467.28 --> 1473.1
say about it like usually I'm typically

1470.88 --> 1474.99
this I'm such a freakin liberal I can't

1473.1 --> 1476.6399999999999
help it it's compulsive but every time

1474.99 --> 1481.2
the Bible comes up in some way I'm

1476.64 --> 1483.0900000000001
always trying to test it test like what

1481.2 --> 1485.73
is that really could you interpret it

1483.09 --> 1490.8899999999999
like this not meaning to blasphemy but

1485.73 --> 1492.51
just I just see so much more in all of

1490.89 --> 1496.49
that then I think that most people

1492.51 --> 1501.53
really get to see and I just want to I

1496.49 --> 1501.53
want to get to the the deeper mystery

1503.99 --> 1511.79
which is literally there as part of it

1508.86 --> 1511.79
anyway

1518.06 --> 1520.6299999999999
what

1541.83 --> 1556.47
No and w dude who are you normally

1563.87 --> 1573.11
okay you saw footage of a device 180

1570.35 --> 1579.01
feet above the earth no spinning no

1573.11 --> 1579.01
curvature you mean in a balloon

1586.1 --> 1591.4099999999999
but it does sound kind of interesting

1588.47 --> 1596.3600000000001
well if you have like a YouTube video

1591.41 --> 1599.1200000000001
for that and what you can do is just

1596.36 --> 1602.32
take the youtube.com part of the link

1599.12 --> 1605.33
out of it and just after that the watch

1602.32 --> 1608.45
question mark V is and then the code and

1605.33 --> 1616.9299999999998
that post that that should be first of

1608.45 --> 1616.93
all and I'll take a look

1630.05 --> 1636.8
so Marco Korean okay since you seem to

1633.08 --> 1639.4399999999998
have some issues with Christianity and

1636.8 --> 1642.29
you're bringing up the Christian agenda

1639.44 --> 1644.5900000000001
so can you please clarify as to what

1642.29 --> 1644.59
that is

1656.75 --> 1661.09
yes the first time I'm hearing that I

1663.94 --> 1669.169
didn't know Christians had this

1666.26 --> 1671.48
overarching agenda

1669.169 --> 1673.8500000000001
I thought Christians kind of have

1671.48 --> 1678.919
methods and principles that they follow

1673.85 --> 1681.73
and that that makes them cohesive by the

1678.919 --> 1681.73
principles themselves

1693.27 --> 1703.98
so yeah please mark ocarina expand on

1698.16 --> 1707.73
that unless unless you were just trying

1703.98 --> 1711.98
to venture Christ allergies in which

1707.73 --> 1711.98
case you might want to stop doing that

1737.679 --> 1750.049
okay that's a balloon right it is a

1742.73 --> 1752.83
balloon and it is a 360 camera that's

1750.049 --> 1752.83
interesting okay

1757.23 --> 1762.14
hmm

1759.38 --> 1765.7990000000002
cool okay yeah that's a pretty good link

1762.14 --> 1768.4

1765.799 --> 1773.539
already posted it thanks for that mark

1768.4 --> 1775.99

1784.42 --> 1793.42
that is that one of the like the public

1790.54 --> 1795.6299999999999
classical things because then I could

1793.42 --> 1795.63
play

1800.79 --> 1804.68
anyway let me see if I can present that

1803.73 --> 1809.15
it's pretty cool

1804.68 --> 1809.15
thanks for the for the tip

1827.83 --> 1832.859

1847.49 --> 1858.45
clumsily re-engineering my OBS alright

1852.87 --> 1860.78

1858.45 --> 1860.78
zip

1863.91 --> 1867.5900000000001

give him a thumbs up that's pretty

1988.089 --> 2008.07
pretty awesome from yesterday oh yeah

1999.159 --> 2011.429
and this thing very existence is

2008.07 --> 2019.2
insulting to me right when the globe is

2011.429 --> 2021.95
an insight remember that what did you

2019.2 --> 2021.95
say Marco

2026.97 --> 2031.65
Marco Crean you're the worst

2035.82 --> 2044.72
anyway yeah that was interesting thanks

2038.369 --> 2044.72
for the link pretty flat

2051.87 --> 2055.52
okay was that

2069.139 --> 2073.38
[Music]

2070.71 --> 2095.91
okay and this is from the me skanks

2073.38 --> 2106.65
Channel let's see what that is okay okay

2095.91 --> 2109.3799999999997
I still owe at my public a video where I

2106.65 --> 2111.36
actually used that bow behind me and

2109.38 --> 2114.75
then shoot a go

2111.36 --> 2117.06
I still need one of these types of

2114.75 --> 2119.52
globes thingies for that and I'll

2117.06 --> 2122.18
definitely do that in the summer and not

2119.52 --> 2122.18
in this weather

2164.83 --> 2172.5
there is no satellite hotels satellite

2170.02 --> 2172.5
hotel

2173.52 --> 2183.22
in a way you could have a blimp hotel

2178.29 --> 2187.9
maybe very small one there would

2183.22 --> 2192.0099999999998
definitely be gravity to grab but yeah

2187.9 --> 2196.78
you could have like a floating little

2192.01 --> 2200.3500000000004
fortress that'd just be sitting up there

2196.78 --> 2205.9300000000003
very high and whatever not for too long

2200.35 --> 2208.2
though if there's going to be people in

2205.93 --> 2208.2
there

2212.19 --> 2220.579
yeah a lot of Hylian that's right

2216.15 --> 2220.579
well I think there is a lot of helium so

2220.76 --> 2228.2990000000004
and who knows with transmutation on the

2225.21 --> 2230.64
table it might be a lot easier to

2228.299 --> 2234.96
actually transform other gases into

2230.64 --> 2241.5
helium at some point or back or back and

2234.96 --> 2243.78
forth so who knows all these rare

2241.5 --> 2246.78
elements don't necessarily have to be

2243.78 --> 2249.049
that rare on the long run don't forget

2246.78 --> 2249.049
about that

2274.54 --> 2284.5
yeah my core arc that's hilarious but

2281.04 --> 2290.95
yeah I'm afraid I don't have any money

2284.5 --> 2293.05
to go traveling abroad at this point all

2290.95 --> 2296.47
right we are Robin Stanley I've seen

2293.05 --> 2299.7400000000002
that or ya seen videos about that and on

2296.47 --> 2302.1299999999997
television programs the ice hotel what

2299.74 --> 2308.56
was it again

2302.13 --> 2310.87
was it didn't in Norway or was it in the

2308.56 --> 2314.46
north of Finland or what was it again I

2310.87 --> 2314.46
think it was in Norway

2337.64 --> 2346.5499999999997
yeah we're almost halfway through the

2343.32 --> 2351.4700000000003
month can you believe it that in

2346.55 --> 2351.4700000000003
two-and-a-half weeks it's gonna be 2020

2353.75 --> 2361.98
when so quick the weird thing is I don't

2358.68 --> 2364.7599999999998
feel like I've aged a lot but I'm kind

2361.98 --> 2364.76
of happy about that

2368.92 --> 2375.4
it's such a stark difference for me at

2371.86 --> 2377.83
least when as I'm older now at this age

2375.4 --> 2379.78
that when you're young it's like one

2377.83 --> 2383.0099999999998
year makes so much difference so much

2379.78 --> 2387.82
happens to you when you're really young

2383.01 --> 2392.6400000000003
just physically but now not yeah it

2387.82 --> 2392.6400000000003
seems like it barely makes a difference

2398.26 --> 2407.5800000000004
make helium liquid again hey Eric you

2402.46 --> 2407.58
know Finland our writer wasn't Finland

2417.65 --> 2422.14
what's with this guy

2428.63 --> 2435.38
sorry but anyone that calls Jesus

2431.51 --> 2437.71
propaganda it's just you're out of line

2435.38 --> 2437.71
buddy

2438.04 --> 2445.46
they sure the Roman Catholic Church is

2443.03 --> 2448.2200000000003
kind of like a power organization that

2445.46 --> 2451.79
you could say politicize or weaponize

2448.22 --> 2455.87
the Bible and in Christ but that's not

2451.79 --> 2460.31
Christ's fault okay so you can't just

2455.87 --> 2463.04
declare him the phenomena Jesus Christ

2460.31 --> 2465.68
the creator in the flesh you can't just

2463.04 --> 2469.7599999999998
call him propaganda just because the

2465.68 --> 2473.68
roman catholic abused all that kept it

2469.76 --> 2473.6800000000003
secret okay

2493.44 --> 2499.32
no I

2496.07 --> 2506.6400000000003
does it surprise you if I say that I

2499.32 --> 2508.53
don't worship anyone I I just tried to

2506.64 --> 2512.0099999999998
see everything for what it is and

2508.53 --> 2515.07
potentially have respect and friendship

2512.01 --> 2517.3500000000004
and all that but I don't worship any one

2515.07 --> 2520.4700000000003
or anything I try not to I said

2517.35 --> 2531.18
unfortunately end up worshiping women

2520.47 --> 2534.6
sometimes still biological issue but I I

2531.18 --> 2539.19
didn't like love Christ and I believed

2534.6 --> 2544.98
in Christ but it's not like I'm putting

2539.19 --> 2547.44
myself like beneath him I think it's

2544.98 --> 2550.89
like I experience that I am beneath him

2547.44 --> 2554.25
because of what he is and how and all

2550.89 --> 2557.49
that but it's not like an oh good to me

2554.25 --> 2561.42
in front of Christ no I don't think he'd

2557.49 --> 2566.22
even want that that's not his way see

2561.42 --> 2570.69
and that's how I tried to follow the

2566.22 --> 2574.2
path I don't worship deities I try to

2570.69 --> 2576.27
recognize them if they really are real

2574.2 --> 2583.41
for what they are and try to figure out

2576.27 --> 2587.22
what it is but like even yeah the statue

2583.41 --> 2589.6499999999996
of disk of this guy there's something

2587.22 --> 2591.9599999999996
very special about him and he is

2589.65 --> 2596.4300000000003
probably a deity or is some kind of

2591.96 --> 2598.68
spirit from the Hindu world I always

2596.43 --> 2601.3799999999997
thought he was Brahma like the original

2598.68 --> 2606.96
creator they're their version of it

2601.38 --> 2610.77
they're personification but I don't know

2606.96 --> 2614.04
it's just like yeah he's a body and I

2610.77 --> 2616.89
kind of have sympathy in certain ways

2614.04 --> 2619.17
and I like the idea of creation and they

2616.89 --> 2619.92
don't worship Him I don't see that thing

2619.17 --> 2626.16
as an idol

2619.92 --> 2629.06
I don't like do things on an altar or

2626.16 --> 2629.06
anything for it

2638.829 --> 2649.809
oh really bizarre win and where's your

2642.339 --> 2652.15
evidence for that like to see some

2649.809 --> 2653.8700000000003
historical evidence for that thank you

2652.15 --> 2657.0
very much

2653.87 --> 2657.0
[Music]

2660.52 --> 2671.53
[Music]

2664.6 --> 2673.5099999999998
Oh which Bible I use or use I've haven't

2671.53 --> 2675.82
honestly even read through the entire

2673.51 --> 2678.3300000000004
thing but yeah you can also learn about

2675.82 --> 2681.5800000000004
the Bible and about what it's about and

2678.33 --> 2690.49
Jesus through other people and through

2681.58 --> 2699.04
other people reading their Bible so yeah

2690.49 --> 2702.7599999999998
the NLT version yeah and what was it

2699.04 --> 2704.74
MC toon sent me this I thanked him alot

2702.76 --> 2706.9300000000003
for it

2704.74 --> 2710.3199999999997
I think he's a baller but it's just very

2706.93 --> 2712.47
nice that he wanted to help me out with

2710.32 --> 2712.4700000000003
that

2719.87 --> 2723.959
[Music]

2721.349 --> 2728.009
no I will not get a gang James I will

2723.959 --> 2735.39
not I will not entertain a Bible that

2728.009 --> 2739.17
has updates and modernisations like

2735.39 --> 2744.989
freaking wine bottles where there should

2739.17 --> 2748.529
be wine sacks I don't trust the King

2744.989 --> 2751.279
James it's been tampered with that's how

2748.529 --> 2751.279
it feels to me

2777.17 --> 2790.14
Romulus really you think Romulus that

2783.63 --> 2793.04
that is real gotta be [ __ ] me that's

2790.14 --> 2794.94
just ridiculous

2793.04 --> 2801.96
as far as Oh

2794.94 --> 2805.11
Zoroaster krishna nicest horse well the

2801.96 --> 2806.4900000000002
first ones there that you mentioned

2805.11 --> 2811.56
there yeah I think they might have

2806.49 --> 2812.31
actually existed now the time as for the

2811.56 --> 2818.43
other ones

2812.31 --> 2821.88
the aneesa's Horace I don't know they

2818.43 --> 2825.2
seem to be more contemporary things

2821.88 --> 2829.23
probably creations of their priesthood I

2825.2 --> 2830.91
think those were real phenomena I don't

2829.23 --> 2837.56
know I don't think so

2830.91 --> 2840.54
as for Romulus that sounds just like

2837.56 --> 2842.93
yeah Roe a lot of Rome is just complete

2840.54 --> 2842.93
fiction

2853.27 --> 2864.93
oh right changes in the Bible

2859.38 --> 2864.9300000000003
mistranslations well who doesn't matter

2865.41 --> 2871.39
it's it's a necessary change and it

2869.56 --> 2875.02
doesn't make any sense because they're

2871.39 --> 2882.2999999999997
very low likelihood that they had

2875.02 --> 2882.3
bottles that they use that

2910.319 --> 2916.14
yeah and as to yeah what causes it did

2913.859 --> 2919.14
they change it or did was it Mandela

2916.14 --> 2923.219
affected right it doesn't matter it's

2919.14 --> 2926.009
just wrong it's not correct why would

2923.219 --> 2928.549
you trust something like that when it's

2926.009 --> 2928.549
just wrong

2935.7 --> 2945.24
yeah well and W dude a lot is also left

2941.819 --> 2947.46
out of the Bible I already said that it

2945.24 --> 2949.41
that you can figure this out for

2947.46 --> 2951.27
yourself as you read if you read the

2949.41 --> 2954.24
words if you read the titles in the

2951.27 --> 2957.569
names certain words imply things and

2954.24 --> 2960.9599999999996
then there's just sperm sparing mention

2957.569 --> 2962.609
of something and then barely or never

2960.96 --> 2965.069
mention again and there should be a

2962.609 --> 2966.7799999999997
giant history of those things yeah it's

2965.069 --> 2969.5099999999998
not in there that's right

2966.78 --> 2979.5890000000004
that doesn't make the rest and true

2969.51 --> 2982.349
though well and that we dude

2979.589 --> 2987.8289999999997
maybe it isn't complete but incomplete

2982.349 --> 2992.3590000000004
to what purpose it maybe it is complete

2987.829 --> 2992.3590000000004
to the purpose that it serves

2996.33 --> 3003.0299999999997
as it is in that enough of the essential

3000.26 --> 3008.3100000000004
frequency the essential message of the

3003.03 --> 3009.8900000000003
path is in there even though there could

3008.31 --> 3015.35
be more

3009.89 --> 3020.22
no no and w dude who is this guy

3015.35 --> 3023.18
seriously no God is not a jealous car

3020.22 --> 3027.4199999999996
that is ridiculous

3023.18 --> 3030.44
the Creator is not a jealous God that

3027.42 --> 3030.44
doesn't make any damn sense

3034.26 --> 3043.0800000000004
and hey I have my own suspicions that

3037.02 --> 3048.84
the Old Testament that that God is not a

3043.08 --> 3053.49
unified entity but probably a collection

3048.84 --> 3058.1400000000003
of the sons of God or of the house of

3053.49 --> 3061.56
the deities that use God as a

3058.14 --> 3065.1
representative face for when they

3061.56 --> 3067.32
appeared to humans I don't think they

3065.1 --> 3070.98
were literally the Creator I don't think

3067.32 --> 3073.56
that the creator himself or not all of

3070.98 --> 3075.9900000000002
the times at least would get involved

3073.56 --> 3078.74
with it I think that even at times it

3075.99 --> 3081.6899999999996
just seemed to me like those

3078.74 --> 3085.29
representatives of of the pantheon of

3081.69 --> 3088.92
the of the house of God would do things

3085.29 --> 3092.31
or let things happen that even the

3088.92 --> 3094.65
creator himself through the background

3092.31 --> 3099.69
would then through those representatives

3094.65 --> 3101.79
actually result in punishment it's

3099.69 --> 3103.77
surreal but I think it happens like that

3101.79 --> 3107.06
I think that in the Old Testaments all

3103.77 --> 3111.359
the the deities were more or less

3107.06 --> 3114.09
representatives and not the Creator in

3111.359 --> 3117.2
but in in person you could say it's kind

3114.09 --> 3117.2000000000003
of weird to say that but

3121.52 --> 3124.57
[Music]

3154.07 --> 3157.1690000000003
[Music]

3176.369 --> 3180.239
right more colored oh that's how I see

3179.88 --> 3188.299
it

3180.239 --> 3191.64
idiot look isn't consistency the key and

3188.299 --> 3196.489
there are in the Bible

3191.64 --> 3201.0589999999997
sons of God it's not like who the

3196.489 --> 3207.44
soldiers of God the workers of God

3201.059 --> 3212.789
though the sons of God that means like

3207.44 --> 3217.92
it's kind of son relates to like family

3212.789 --> 3220.17
or blood or multiplication so it seems

3217.92 --> 3223.529
like there is more than one entity as

3220.17 --> 3226.289
the creator he was probably the first so

3223.529 --> 3231.059
he had probably a pantheon surrounding

3226.289 --> 3234.0890000000004
him and those godly offspring you could

3231.059 --> 3243.329
call them they would be doing things as

3234.089 --> 3246.479
well I'm not making the sons of God up

3243.329 --> 3249.42
it is mentioned in there it is a part of

3246.479 --> 3255.45
it so that implies that there is just

3249.42 --> 3261.829
that there's offspring of the creator or

3255.45 --> 3261.8289999999997
if his original avatar or something

3280.6 --> 3288.22
oh really Tom Parker sums of God are

3284.77 --> 3292.03
angels oh yeah yeah where where did you

3288.22 --> 3294.6
actually hear that and in what book was

3292.03 --> 3294.6000000000004
that set

3299.65 --> 3312.94
really well just saying yes really it's

3304.27 --> 3317.55
not I'll be cutting it Ebru translation

3312.94 --> 3320.44
all right so some of God means an angel

3317.55 --> 3322.26
so why wouldn't it be called the

3320.44 --> 3324.67
servants of God

3322.26 --> 3331.6600000000003
right that's what angels are aren't they

3324.67 --> 3336.67
right or is there an actual offspring

3331.66 --> 3340.66
relation and then maybe angel would be

3336.67 --> 3343.69
like a lesser designation a functional

3340.66 --> 3348.6
designation of this offspring would

3343.69 --> 3353.86
still make them actually related okay

3348.6 --> 3356.65
it seems guys are also set in the way

3353.86 --> 3358.9900000000002
you see these things it's like the games

3356.65 --> 3361.42
and the stories they all put it into

3358.99 --> 3367.3599999999997
your mind in a very specific way but do

3361.42 --> 3368.8
you really understand what it is now I'm

3367.36 --> 3372.3900000000003
not making [ __ ] up

3368.8 --> 3372.3900000000003
I'm just looking a little deeper

3374.27 --> 3377.42
[Music]

3392.569 --> 3397.88
Oh a video in the link where they will

3395.15 --> 3400.699
talk about the angels and what they did

3397.88 --> 3404.059
yeah I've seen it seen it I've heard it

3400.699 --> 3407.689
so very nice it doesn't actually address

3404.059 --> 3410.6890000000003
the issue just says no no no no don't

3407.689 --> 3416.769
don't pay attention to that word no just

3410.689 --> 3416.769
accept that it is angels right

3417.429 --> 3427.719
no no words mean what they mean not what

3424.16 --> 3427.719
other people want them to me

3440.59 --> 3445.92
yeah Friday the 13th that's true it's

3443.74 --> 3449.0499999999997
actually my lucky day

3445.92 --> 3452.08
it always is my lucky day has been since

3449.05 --> 3454.1800000000003
I was very young I was good things

3452.08 --> 3459.15
happen to me I find money and [ __ ]

3454.18 --> 3459.1499999999996
it's weird I like Friday the 13th

3470.22 --> 3476.62
yeah

3472.6 --> 3480.64
no NW dude he would not done straw man

3476.62 --> 3483.3399999999997
him with that nonsense scientific method

3480.64 --> 3486.3599999999997
is really it's not related you go with

3483.34 --> 3490.4500000000003
historic evidence and then you go with

3486.36 --> 3493.63
the actual foundation of how things are

3490.45 --> 3495.8199999999997
there and how they work and the creation

3493.63 --> 3498.7000000000003
nature of it and that's what he's gonna

3495.82 --> 3501.61
do a combination of historical evidence

3498.7 --> 3506.02
for Jesus and the creation nature of

3501.61 --> 3508.1800000000003
reality and the realm that is where is

3506.02 --> 3513.52
gonna take it not scientific method as

3508.18 --> 3515.14
ridiculous and very manipulate something

3513.52 --> 3516.57
that's no longer there that's in the

3515.14 --> 3524.23
past

3516.57 --> 3526.75
