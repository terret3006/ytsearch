304.62 --> 314.069
yesterday pretty long and shared some

311.22 --> 317.41900000000004
long-term views on the situation on the

314.069 --> 321.889
internet and politics and all that and

317.419 --> 326.34
he's had some very interesting well

321.889 --> 327.93
personal medical research developments

326.34 --> 331.02
like with supplements

327.93 --> 337.71
he's trying all kinds of things out and

331.02 --> 339.78
some interesting findings so yeah I'm

337.71 --> 344.909
actually considering trying something

339.78 --> 347.849
out but yeah that it will cost some so

344.909 --> 349.59
I'm not gonna it's not like something

347.849 --> 351.349
I'm gonna prioritize but it was

349.59 --> 355.79999999999995
definitely interesting

351.349 --> 359.78
and yeah Rasta looks completely

355.8 --> 359.78000000000003
different compared to like two years ago

360.86 --> 366.599
looks much healthier much more radiant

363.75 --> 368.909
much more stable and he has well he's

366.599 --> 371.039
been working out a lot and you can

368.909 --> 374.509
definitely see it his arms are like at

371.039 --> 374.509
least twice the size now

379.51 --> 382.57
[Music]

383.09 --> 385.71999999999997
yeah

388.5 --> 403.41
cut the start efi royalty yeah AI didn't

392.31 --> 406.59
make it out like what that what does

403.41 --> 410.61
that mean actually does that mean I'm

406.59 --> 421.56
first here or is there even something

410.61 --> 423.81
above that I didn't yeah whatever but

421.56 --> 426.56
yeah I do appreciate the credit being

423.81 --> 426.56
given to me

436.59 --> 441.44
yeah I might actually married on the

438.93 --> 445.2
other hand yeah I wouldn't necessarily

441.44 --> 449.16
wait it could work if I just upload it

445.2 --> 450.53999999999996
and then link it to yours that might

449.16 --> 453.03000000000003
actually work because I don't want to

450.54 --> 456.15000000000003
detract more diffuse from your channel

453.03 --> 461.96999999999997
you know you guys did that it's your

456.15 --> 464.78
show you deserve some views but yeah

461.97 --> 464.78000000000003
maybe I'll do it like that

466.07 --> 469.19
[Music]

474.1 --> 483.68
[Music]

476.49 --> 483.68
what obliged to do a song there

493.66 --> 504.82000000000005
yeah look I could do that I guess I

501.73 --> 509.08000000000004
don't know this is if it's like a thing

504.82 --> 513.669
sure I could just I guess take the mic

509.08 --> 516.0699999999999
and then seeing something - I would be

513.669 --> 519.97
it would be a little weird but I can't

516.07 --> 521.71
do that you know it's not gonna be I'm

519.97 --> 528.82
not like a glorious singer or anything

521.71 --> 529.59
when but I do have a good I have what is

528.82 --> 534.73
it

529.59 --> 535.0600000000001
tone awareness a lot inherited from my

534.73 --> 538.19
mother

535.06 --> 538.1899999999999
[Music]

551.49 --> 554.629
[Music]

556.61 --> 564.96
so what do you guys been up to and this

560.19 --> 574.2900000000001
Friday I haven't really watched too many

564.96 --> 577.6800000000001
things yeah Owen Benjamin twice I caught

574.29 --> 579.9599999999999
the first show most of it and the second

577.68 --> 581.64
show two in the evening but then I cut

579.96 --> 584.22
it off because I just didn't want to go

581.64 --> 588.63
to bed that late it was still pretty

584.22 --> 591.9300000000001
damn late but yeah but it was pretty

588.63 --> 596.46
filled with gravy that that weird video

591.93 --> 601.0799999999999
it it was such an odd video that was an

596.46 --> 605.76
animated one between a like a bandit

601.08 --> 609.6600000000001
type of rooster and a well kind of a

605.76 --> 612.63
small hat ish hen or something and they

609.66 --> 617.01
were complaining about like the price of

612.63 --> 618.81
goat milk and like yeah it was such so

617.01 --> 624.15
it's such a weird video it's such an

618.81 --> 626.64
oddity like it seems extremely random

624.15 --> 635.2099999999999
but it is just fascinating in in its own

626.64 --> 635.21
way i RM was back

636.209 --> 642.6899999999999
okay Chara sent furred didn't

639.97 --> 645.94
necessarily need to know that but sure

642.69 --> 648.639
my sphere lifes were colored glasses

645.94 --> 649.69
alright that's was that Ivan Rome media

648.639 --> 656.399
yeah that was last night

649.69 --> 656.399
oh dear there was actual karaoke there

661.26 --> 669.77
uh-huh okay I might check that out a

666.77 --> 669.77
little

690.76 --> 695.059
[Music]

701.7 --> 705.3900000000001
[Music]

703.5 --> 711.47
a torn-up towel

705.39 --> 711.47
[Music]

724.67 --> 731.4499999999999
oh right yeah rust I had a surprising

728.96 --> 733.5500000000001
story for me that yeah because he keeps

731.45 --> 736.4300000000001
track in circles that I don't keep track

733.55 --> 737.9
of but apparently he had this pretty

736.43 --> 740.3
interesting story I don't know if

737.9 --> 743.27
anybody else can confirm this about Sam

740.3 --> 745.5799999999999
Tripoli now I don't follow that guy

743.27 --> 751.0699999999999
because he used to annoy the [ __ ] out of

745.58 --> 754.19
me so I like quickly dropped off but

751.07 --> 756.5
apparently because he was also like

754.19 --> 760.24
promoting using crack and [ __ ] it was

756.5 --> 763.58
completely over the edge but apparently

760.24 --> 768.35
so rasta said to me he's turned his life

763.58 --> 772.99
around and went to rehab and now he's

768.35 --> 775.85
completely changed and he's well as

772.99 --> 780.14
rasta describes it he's kind of like

775.85 --> 784.0400000000001
applying a Nathan Oakley attitude being

780.14 --> 786.68
very super strict super super strict on

784.04 --> 788.36
everyone that's what he says I haven't

786.68 --> 789.29
actually checked anything what does

788.36 --> 794.5600000000001
anybody else

789.29 --> 798.3199999999999
as everybody else followed Sam triply

794.56 --> 799.91
any fans of his here probably yeah I

798.32 --> 804.2600000000001
don't know I'm not gonna say probably

799.91 --> 806.5699999999999
not but who knows you know I watch Alex

804.26 --> 809.03
Jones that doesn't really this is this

806.57 --> 812.84
not that I really watch it with pleasure

809.03 --> 817.37
on a daily basis but I'm just always try

812.84 --> 819.9100000000001
to get it give it a look like see what's

817.37 --> 823.22
going on there who's that

819.91 --> 826.51
Sam Tripoli Sam Tripoli is apparently a

823.22 --> 826.51
good buddy of Eddie Bravo

830.87 --> 837.86
and he's also has a show and all that

834.0 --> 837.86
and they do things together I think

844.61 --> 851.27
anyway yeah I might just see if I can

847.74 --> 851.27
find him on YouTube or something

853.97 --> 858.5
all right is a podcast

862.13 --> 868.99
oh yeah he's also a colleague with Joe

866.48 --> 868.99
Rogan

874.41 --> 878.5799999999999
so he's like in that crowd you know I

876.57 --> 882.3900000000001
don't know if you guys know that but

878.58 --> 885.75
yeah there's Eddie Bravo Joe Rogan Sam

882.39 --> 891.15
triply maybe some others that typically

885.75 --> 893.34
hang around and do shows and Alex Jones

891.15 --> 901.01
sometimes gets in there and gets all

893.34 --> 901.01
silly who is that

910.1 --> 914.77
right I'll just the show picture

917.07 --> 920.2090000000001
[Music]

929.119 --> 940.219
this guy what yeah let's see wouldn't I

935.109 --> 942.0490000000001
think this is probably this most

940.219 --> 945.759
familiar look with like the black hat

942.049 --> 945.759
and the glasses and the beard

956.74 --> 960.04
I don't know yeah I don't know if you

958.66 --> 963.01
know recognize him

960.04 --> 967.62
see here he is Eddie Bravo Alex Jones

963.01 --> 967.62
Sam tripley and I don't know who that is

969.0 --> 979.529
let's just get the freaking picture view

975.61 --> 979.529
image there you go

981.6 --> 996.49
and sound tripley's the guy with the

985.48 --> 998.61
blue shirt right so I don't know if that

996.49 --> 1001.8
says anything to you guys

998.61 --> 1003.72
but yeah that's ant Ripley and he is

1001.8 --> 1007.1999999999999
kind of has a bigger audience

1003.72 --> 1009.779
although yeah because of his his

1007.2 --> 1012.69
personal dwellings apparently it did go

1009.779 --> 1018.29
down a little but he's reformed himself

1012.69 --> 1018.2900000000001
also Rasta says

1035.049 --> 1043.779
I quit again and when he flip-flop it

1039.269 --> 1047.289
yeah I don't watch Joe Rogan at all the

1043.779 --> 1049.47
only times I really watched him was yeah

1047.289 --> 1051.749
at the time when Alex Jones went all

1049.47 --> 1054.789
interdimensional on him and everything

1051.749 --> 1057.8790000000001
like the podcast the first and the

1054.789 --> 1060.45
second but yeah I've already been

1057.879 --> 1064.779
confronted with Joe Rogan through

1060.45 --> 1067.929
through Owen Benjamin that is so it's

1064.779 --> 1074.97
what I call my ask for Rogen's up you

1067.929 --> 1077.3500000000001
know but yeah so I personally don't have

1074.97 --> 1080.59
like I'm not at war with him all right

1077.35 --> 1082.869
he's not like a hostile to me but yeah

1080.59 --> 1088.4499999999998
it's he's done some ridiculous things

1082.869 --> 1092.049
and some yeah very morally dubious

1088.45 --> 1095.71
habits if you know what I mean yeah at a

1092.049 --> 1100.529
fool a tool however you want to see it

1095.71 --> 1105.3400000000001
he happens to be very small and gay or

1100.529 --> 1112.299
like what does it like gives no [ __ ]

1105.34 --> 1115.049
type of sexual apparently isn't

1112.299 --> 1115.049
Mercurian

1116.11 --> 1128.1399999999999
yeah you can find out what that means in

1118.75 --> 1130.71
the in the future right yeah he is

1128.14 --> 1134.26
pretty strong though you know he is a

1130.71 --> 1136.3600000000001
good martial artist like if he'd wanted

1134.26 --> 1138.7
to [ __ ] you up he wouldn't just do that

1136.36 --> 1142.0
you know but if he did if he'd find a

1138.7 --> 1144.43
good reason he could so I wouldn't want

1142.0 --> 1146.2
to go up against him you know he'd

1144.43 --> 1152.3200000000002
probably just crushed my neck very

1146.2 --> 1153.82
quickly so yeah although it had it have

1152.32 --> 1158.07
to catch me first

1153.82 --> 1158.07
you know that's the thing

1173.63 --> 1179.39
where y'all watch O&B bit too

1177.62 --> 1181.82
Ida is he at bit tube I don't know I

1179.39 --> 1185.539
haven't checked now I watch him over D

1181.82 --> 1185.9289999999999
life he has live streams sometimes twice

1185.539 --> 1192.559
a day

1185.929 --> 1195.8300000000002
I think he usually starts when it's

1192.559 --> 1205.1299999999999
early starts at like 6:00 p.m. amsterdam

1195.83 --> 1207.08
time like pretty early and no it's like

1205.13 --> 1209.5100000000002
in the early afternoon i think something

1207.08 --> 1212.4499999999998
like that and then later much much later

1209.51 --> 1218.539
at like at night usually around 3 or 4

1212.45 --> 1223.909
o'clock or something at night he does a

1218.539 --> 1226.58
second stream yeah unfortunately I

1223.909 --> 1228.2600000000002
haven't he hasn't said things to replay

1226.58 --> 1231.26
a lot he does it sometimes especially

1228.26 --> 1233.03
when the streams incredibly choppy so

1231.26 --> 1235.97
you can just watch it again without all

1233.03 --> 1238.7
the without all the connection

1235.97 --> 1242.24
interruptions but most of the streams he

1238.7 --> 1245.0900000000001
does he doesn't replay them it just have

1242.24 --> 1248.09
to go to his personal website and

1245.09 --> 1249.77
subscribe to it with payment and then

1248.09 --> 1252.08
you can just watch everything you ever

1249.77 --> 1255.9089999999999
wants on there apparently I haven't even

1252.08 --> 1260.1789999999999
tried it I should probably try it

1255.909 --> 1265.8700000000001
being a yeah pretty pretty big fan of

1260.179 --> 1265.8700000000001
Owen Benjamin myself if I like to say so

1269.74 --> 1291.04
okay he lies exposed yeah or he isn't

1287.51 --> 1295.51
really dumb you know he's just not very

1291.04 --> 1295.51
wise one could consider

1301.73 --> 1304.809
[Music]

1305.64 --> 1315.26
well Owens Tian who's that

1310.32 --> 1318.62
oh and Tian is a shekel loving wizard

1315.26 --> 1318.62
who is that

1320.68 --> 1323.829
[Music]

1329.63 --> 1335.99
all right the NASA jumpsuit suit yep yes

1333.89 --> 1340.72
never sleep well it seems like that

1335.99 --> 1344.57
thing you know it's it's like this media

1340.72 --> 1347.539
contract or project or something that

1344.57 --> 1349.46
Alex Jones has pretty much started out

1347.539 --> 1353.03
doing from the start being like yeah

1349.46 --> 1354.98
NASA go to space and the deep state is

1353.03 --> 1359.33
holding us back from going to space

1354.98 --> 1362.27
that's pretty much the overarching the

1359.33 --> 1364.46
storyline and just filler in between and

1362.27 --> 1368.539
more fantasy and [ __ ] that's like his

1364.46 --> 1370.58
backdrop feel narrative and then yeah

1368.539 --> 1372.4089999999999
Joe Rogan eventually he started out

1370.58 --> 1374.6589999999999
saying I god the moon landings were

1372.409 --> 1376.8500000000001
faking [ __ ] and kind of getting into

1374.659 --> 1380.63
Flat Earth and then suddenly he switched

1376.85 --> 1383.24
around and then he started to become

1380.63 --> 1385.75
although Flat Earth is crazy and why

1383.24 --> 1388.94
would they lie just the basic nonsense

1385.75 --> 1393.289
so it's almost like they're trying to

1388.94 --> 1397.46
form this team this Pro space team like

1393.289 --> 1399.77
the the last space pirates get that

1397.46 --> 1402.409
feeling like they're the last space

1399.77 --> 1405.35
pirates that's what they want it's like

1402.409 --> 1410.21
when the whole world turns flat we are

1405.35 --> 1412.8799999999999
the last space ventures and they want to

1410.21 --> 1414.8600000000001
keep upholding that dream this against

1412.88 --> 1416.7800000000002
all odds against all data against all

1414.86 --> 1422.6299999999999
conscious awakening they just want to

1416.78 --> 1427.48
keep it going but pirates yeah you can

1422.63 --> 1427.48
do this you said it not me

1428.74 --> 1431.829
[Music]

1449.68 --> 1459.93
don't get al don't go there

1455.5 --> 1459.93
lice exposure and up dogs just don't

1461.1 --> 1465.48
don't do that

1462.52 --> 1465.48
in my chat please

1477.419 --> 1485.2
right yeah Jordan when somebody mentions

1481.21 --> 1489.8790000000001
shekels right they do it for a reason

1485.2 --> 1492.159
okay because it is established that that

1489.879 --> 1494.9189999999999
is kind of going on there is specific

1492.159 --> 1497.8600000000001
money feed keeping certain things going

1494.919 --> 1500.5900000000001
and that's why people then very over

1497.86 --> 1502.9599999999998
generalize to use that term because

1500.59 --> 1504.9599999999998
they're kind of assuming that the Jews

1502.96 --> 1508.409
are in control

1504.96 --> 1510.7
it is very over generalized I know

1508.409 --> 1517.48
doesn't mean there's nothing to it

1510.7 --> 1521.519
you know because yeah it is kind of tied

1517.48 --> 1531.09
in it seems with space the space

1521.519 --> 1531.09
narrative space idea trickery all that

1534.75 --> 1539.909
but I'm talking a power structure down

1537.6 --> 1542.8799999999999
and banking wise and all that the money

1539.909 --> 1545.159
powers not just the average person that

1542.88 --> 1548.7600000000002
follows that certain religious tradition

1545.159 --> 1553.3090000000002
as it were or even citizen of that very

1548.76 --> 1556.53
specific country there next to the ocean

1553.309 --> 1560.51
pretty much in the dead center of the

1556.53 --> 1564.6589999999999
biggest landmass in the world which is

1560.51 --> 1567.36
Africa Asia Europe because technically

1564.659 --> 1569.21
it is a singular landmass and it's

1567.36 --> 1573.559
pretty much that center in the middle

1569.21 --> 1573.559
you all know what I'm talking about

1598.88 --> 1607.69
right basic CMC yes bait 60 our MC is

1604.13 --> 1611.2
correct he did then we all looked at it

1607.69 --> 1613.43
we were all like oh god is Joe Rogan

1611.2 --> 1616.3400000000001
coming with flattered through in time

1613.43 --> 1619.88
off like when Patricia steer was still

1616.34 --> 1623.36
there and Mark Sargent blooming a lot

1619.88 --> 1625.73
and Nathan Oakley was already it was

1623.36 --> 1629.08
like among them as a starter not having

1625.73 --> 1631.1
the flat earth of it yet and Joe Rogan

1629.08 --> 1633.08
was like yeah moon landing and

1631.1 --> 1635.0
everybody's like oh god like we're gonna

1633.08 --> 1636.83
get even bigger bigger right and then

1635.0 --> 1642.26
suddenly he switched around and became

1636.83 --> 1649.1899999999998
like a total dick and that is when the

1642.26 --> 1654.62
toe was born as it were but that

1649.19 --> 1658.79
happened quite a while ago now lies

1654.62 --> 1664.61
exposed stop it stop poking yes stop

1658.79 --> 1667.9099999999999
poking Jordan please I know he has

1664.61 --> 1675.9499999999998
problems but yeah doing that's not gonna

1667.91 --> 1678.65
help it's just like telling his sweet to

1675.95 --> 1683.21
stop being so liberal doesn't work you

1678.65 --> 1687.92
know and he's not a sweet he's a

1683.21 --> 1691.31
Norwegian but they're neighbors so that

1687.92 --> 1693.8200000000002
should tell you something at least all

1691.31 --> 1693.82
right thank you

1702.399 --> 1709.539
yeah yeah yeah don't don't take it all

1706.519 --> 1709.539
too personal dude

1716.22 --> 1722.44
atheism is a problem in a way but yeah

1719.8 --> 1728.309
you don't really see it until you figure

1722.44 --> 1728.309
out why from a per on a personal level

1729.059 --> 1735.0
and maybe you're not there yet

1731.38 --> 1735.0
I don't know

1738.82 --> 1744.07
mm-hmm yes you're not though I know at

1742.87 --> 1752.05
least I don't know if everybody knows

1744.07 --> 1754.9199999999998
about that I do know it's interesting I

1752.05 --> 1758.56
know a perk I had a relationship with a

1754.92 --> 1760.8600000000001
with a girl that actually moved there

1758.56 --> 1768.46
with yeah with her new boyfriend

1760.86 --> 1771.37
he moved she moved to Norway because she

1768.46 --> 1775.65
really didn't like Dutch people anymore

1771.37 --> 1778.57
how they changed and I was like yeah

1775.65 --> 1782.2
fortunately yeah I'm not gonna move to

1778.57 --> 1787.51
Norway because I'd have to miss my dad

1782.2 --> 1789.64
and just I don't know if it would work

1787.51 --> 1791.23
you know I could get around with English

1789.64 --> 1793.63
but I don't know Norway he's also

1791.23 --> 1805.45
extremely cold and I don't like the cold

1793.63 --> 1807.8500000000001
I don't like it she escaped to Norway

1805.45 --> 1810.52
yeah that is kind of like how it did

1807.85 --> 1813.2199999999998
feel at the time you know she was so

1810.52 --> 1815.2
decisive about it as well that it kind

1813.22 --> 1817.81
of unnerved me it almost made me feel

1815.2 --> 1820.27
like she's escaping before like a war

1817.81 --> 1830.46
spring so at the time and got me quite

1820.27 --> 1830.46
paranoid even like this was was that

1831.03 --> 1838.09
2008-2009 over there so that was still

1835.0 --> 1842.65
when yeah when Alex Jones hasn't hadn't

1838.09 --> 1845.77
really turned completely like the way he

1842.65 --> 1848.2900000000002
is yet and I was still caught on in the

1845.77 --> 1851.23
alarmism system because Obama was pretty

1848.29 --> 1854.5
much still raining and all that so that

1851.23 --> 1859.26
was like oh [ __ ] like my friend is

1854.5 --> 1864.55
escaping the Meadowlands I'm stuck here

1859.26 --> 1868.32
made me kind of nervous but yeah that's

1864.55 --> 1868.32
a that's a long time ago now

1875.049 --> 1880.679
ah your rainy cold summers that's that

1879.129 --> 1886.9889999999998
sounds fantastic

1880.679 --> 1891.1000000000001
no but Jordan for me also it is I am not

1886.989 --> 1895.809
yeah like I have Eurasian traits I have

1891.1 --> 1897.759
some Asian genetics in me and I need

1895.809 --> 1903.039
sunlight like if I don't get enough

1897.759 --> 1905.619
sunlight it's gonna [ __ ] me up so going

1903.039 --> 1907.509
to Norway would be a great detriment for

1905.619 --> 1911.23
my health that I probably yeah I could

1907.509 --> 1913.3890000000001
try to supplement that problem out of

1911.23 --> 1917.169
the way but it would still it would

1913.389 --> 1920.7389999999998
still be not be good for my system I'd

1917.169 --> 1923.5900000000001
thrive much better in places like Spain

1920.739 --> 1925.509
and all that like every time I didn't to

1923.59 --> 1929.519
Spain because of a vacation or something

1925.509 --> 1929.519
it was very good for my health

1958.55 --> 1966.05
the Spaniards are so noisy yeah they can

1962.18 --> 1966.8300000000002
be all mediterraneans can so Italy

1966.05 --> 1969.9199999999998
Greece

1966.83 --> 1972.08
God you know aloud they canned me the

1969.92 --> 1974.38
there they can all be very noisy and

1972.08 --> 1978.56
they all have this tendency to just

1974.38 --> 1981.0700000000002
communicate very loudly and people in

1978.56 --> 1985.76
North Africa a lot of them have this -

1981.07 --> 1990.08
that is just that like yeah we're we're

1985.76 --> 1993.8
just used to lalalalala pure yeah just

1990.08 --> 2001.1999999999998
throw it out there that's kind of normal

1993.8 --> 2001.2
to them yeah get very loud

2010.16 --> 2015.98
I can touch my face whenever I please

2013.37 --> 2021.07
besides I washed my hands I actually did

2015.98 --> 2024.07
that and my face too so it's just yeah

2021.07 --> 2024.07
whatever

2034.419 --> 2037.3200000000002
what is this

2041.7 --> 2047.01
what are you saying allies exposed here

2044.69 --> 2053.899
putting all kinds of things out there in

2047.01 --> 2061.29
my chat they speak Mexican in Spain

2053.899 --> 2063.96
okay Cleary I don't think so besides

2061.29 --> 2073.05
it's Mexican even a language it's kind

2063.96 --> 2077.21
of silly Oh some needs to make a song I

2073.05 --> 2077.21
touch my face right now

2087.02 --> 2089.89
all right

2099.15 --> 2105.7490000000003
the worldwide shutdowns well-studied

2102.079 --> 2109.46
Cosentino I think I think the problem is

2105.749 --> 2114.45
much bigger than anybody even realize

2109.46 --> 2117.15
really cause it to me it feels like the

2114.45 --> 2120.4199999999996
darkness is making a stand now it's like

2117.15 --> 2123.9
they're being routed in a way so that

2120.42 --> 2129.779
going full out full out and that means

2123.9 --> 2131.94
they will never stop never it's like

2129.779 --> 2134.369
they will push you until you literally

2131.94 --> 2136.319
give up your mind because you can't deal

2134.369 --> 2139.109
with it anymore and you just want to

2136.319 --> 2142.109
forget about it or until people bind

2139.109 --> 2146.5789999999997
together basically surround them and

2142.109 --> 2147.63
then just like okay it's over you're not

2146.579 --> 2150.329
gonna do this anymore

2147.63 --> 2153.299
yeah will people do that or will they

2150.329 --> 2155.789
all elbow each other out of the way

2153.299 --> 2157.559
though I am the number one self on you

2155.789 --> 2164.2200000000003
I'm the one that's gonna take all the

2157.559 --> 2166.9500000000003
credit is that gonna happen because it

2164.22 --> 2169.859
yeah when you look at the state of the

2166.95 --> 2173.7
general public and then this move it's

2169.859 --> 2179.759
almost like oh [ __ ] they might actually

2173.7 --> 2186.019
kind of get away with it and win crash

2179.759 --> 2192.2690000000002
the awakening with pure pure strangling

2186.019 --> 2194.4889999999996
yeah pure strangle you know if if all

2192.269 --> 2197.4889999999996
the people allow it if everyone [ __ ]

2194.489 --> 2200.9990000000003
and then it's all about the people that

2197.489 --> 2203.759
don't talk to it do they realize how

2200.999 --> 2206.999
serious this is are they going to be

2203.759 --> 2209.97
like hmm hmm I'm not gonna go there but

2206.999 --> 2211.769
yeah I'm not gonna do anything other

2209.97 --> 2213.8689999999997
than just stand back and let it'll

2211.769 --> 2216.4199999999996
happen either no because I don't think

2213.869 --> 2220.049
we can really stand back and let this

2216.42 --> 2224.609
all happen again because it will like

2220.049 --> 2227.19
pretty much permanently break society if

2224.609 --> 2230.39
this keeps up if this is allowed to be

2227.19 --> 2230.39
abused like this

2242.02 --> 2246.82
and I think that there's also other

2244.15 --> 2250.51
groups that are more organized that know

2246.82 --> 2255.04
this and they are getting ready for to

2250.51 --> 2256.69
organize that I hope so in the places

2255.04 --> 2257.74
where there isn't this group they're

2256.69 --> 2261.4900000000002
screwed

2257.74 --> 2263.5899999999997
they're absolutely screwed because this

2261.49 --> 2268.2
thing is just gonna continue until

2263.59 --> 2271.619
everything is just completely choked and

2268.2 --> 2273.5699999999997
everything's been brought up because Oh

2271.619 --> 2279.79
what again

2273.57 --> 2284.52
thank you a menu I will check my paypal

2279.79 --> 2284.52
thank you very much geesh

2288.14 --> 2299.33
what okay this keeps up and I can say

2297.59 --> 2301.82
that I actually have an income on a

2299.33 --> 2307.43
daily basis now this is thank you so

2301.82 --> 2309.8500000000004
much Amanda young 20 euros wow you're

2307.43 --> 2309.85
the best

2310.27 --> 2316.07
it's incredible and and of course the

2314.39 --> 2328.31
five dollars from the super chat thank

2316.07 --> 2332.4500000000003
you so much al mundo the great yes yes

2328.31 --> 2335.99
it is is it killing so can it be

2332.45 --> 2339.14
medically confirmed that these deaths

2335.99 --> 2342.16
were specifically caused by the virus or

2339.14 --> 2345.2
did those people just happen to have a

2342.16 --> 2348.0099999999998
certain level of virus of that type

2345.2 --> 2351.95
present in them during the time of death

2348.01 --> 2354.17
because that seems to be the most yeah

2351.95 --> 2359.5099999999998
that in the most cases it turns out to

2354.17 --> 2360.9500000000003
be that pretty much and yeah in certain

2359.51 --> 2363.76
regions where things are very

2360.95 --> 2368.54
politicized they make it even worse and

2363.76 --> 2370.7000000000003
just say like okay we all that that all

2368.54 --> 2373.12
deaths are now Corona deaths like

2370.7 --> 2376.33
they're gonna just tag it Corona death I

2373.12 --> 2378.74
think that's what they did in Italy and

2376.33 --> 2380.63
they might actually be doing something

2378.74 --> 2383.2299999999996
similar in the United States to like

2380.63 --> 2386.8900000000003
when you suddenly get like this sudden

2383.23 --> 2389.0
pile of deaths really they all just

2386.89 --> 2391.7
simultaneously got this and then all

2389.0 --> 2393.47
died pretty much simultaneously no no

2391.7 --> 2395.8399999999997
that doesn't make any damn sense that

2393.47 --> 2400.1299999999997
seems more like a death count of the day

2395.84 --> 2403.28
of just standards standards deaths which

2400.13 --> 2405.6800000000003
happen on a daily basis from all kinds

2403.28 --> 2409.8500000000004
of different causes and then suddenly a

2405.68 --> 2413.02
death count is just tagged corona and

2409.85 --> 2416.69
certainly we got doesn't grown at this

2413.02 --> 2419.69
mmm-hmm I think it's that I don't have

2416.69 --> 2421.23
any proof for this but the way it's

2419.69 --> 2427.08
coming out that

2421.23 --> 2434.369
makes more sense to me so that is my

2427.08 --> 2437.609
suspicion yes Paul UNIX the aimed

2434.369 --> 2440.2200000000003
outcome is total world police state

2437.609 --> 2448.95
domination with no recourse

2440.22 --> 2451.859
it is a first in the last few steps of a

2448.95 --> 2454.71
final move for a neo feudalistic world

2451.859 --> 2460.5
government system yeah that's what it is

2454.71 --> 2463.7400000000002
and it's not gonna go away until yeah

2460.5 --> 2468.03
until it's forced to go away because

2463.74 --> 2471.2999999999997
this is why this is why this is massive

2468.03 --> 2476.69
massive police corruption on a just an

2471.3 --> 2476.69
epic scale insane worldwide probably and

2476.81 --> 2484.64
including their hospitals and doctors

2480.78 --> 2490.9500000000003
and secret [ __ ] going on with that and

2484.64 --> 2493.35
politicians this is massive it's like

2490.95 --> 2496.2
there were more people in there then

2493.35 --> 2498.63
everybody really realized and they

2496.2 --> 2503.43
turned out to become more willing to

2498.63 --> 2505.23
double down on the darkness as well it's

2503.43 --> 2510.0899999999997
like they didn't want to give it up even

2505.23 --> 2512.03
though it was obviously time for it to

2510.09 --> 2516.119
stop

2512.03 --> 2519.0
and that's what we're seeing now I think

2516.119 --> 2522.09
it's just the darkness coming out it's

2519.0 --> 2527.19
like a fever and suddenly the real

2522.09 --> 2532.88
sickness starts to show itself but yeah

2527.19 --> 2532.88
it can kill you if you let it

2533.44 --> 2540.63
and effectively they're all using this

2537.28 --> 2545.2000000000003
as a as a as a combined system banks

2540.63 --> 2547.21
police medical enforcement their dare

2545.2 --> 2549.91
use it Paulette politics they're using

2547.21 --> 2551.95
it to literally bankrupt things and then

2549.91 --> 2553.8689999999997
whatever they like about what is being

2551.95 --> 2557.74
bankrupt that they buy it up for pennies

2553.869 --> 2560.8900000000003
on the dollar as they say and then they

2557.74 --> 2563.2
have it and then they can use that to

2560.89 --> 2566.0499999999997
push even more out of the way so it is

2563.2 --> 2568.66
like yeah that is what neo feudalism

2566.05 --> 2571.3590000000004
does it is take control of everything

2568.66 --> 2574.0
it's like okay yeah everybody did stuff

2571.359 --> 2577.089
made money okay it's all ours now

2574.0 --> 2579.28
and we're gonna force you through

2577.089 --> 2582.52
starvation and isolation to give

2579.28 --> 2587.2000000000003
everything you have to us so it's like

2582.52 --> 2591.339
all people are being seized in their own

2587.2 --> 2594.31
countries by the system they're being

2591.339 --> 2596.8289999999997
besieged the people are being besieged

2594.31 --> 2600.88
they're being forced to stay in their

2596.829 --> 2603.849
homes by the government that is supposed

2600.88 --> 2607.839
to actually protect them from outsiders

2603.849 --> 2611.8900000000003
but they have kind of become covertly

2607.839 --> 2615.2999999999997
slightly mo more overtly hostile like an

2611.89 --> 2619.77
invading force it's not there yet but

2615.3 --> 2619.77
it's pushing that direction

2624.41 --> 2633.6
we'll the lockdown be permanent

2627.26 --> 2636.57
no but the extra added um consequences

2633.6 --> 2640.68
the the precedents that are being said

2636.57 --> 2646.23
socially they're gonna stay they're not

2640.68 --> 2648.72
gonna let that go away yeah so probably

2646.23 --> 2651.06
they're gonna they're gonna just keep

2648.72 --> 2653.3689999999997
continuing like yeah this corona it's

2651.06 --> 2654.71
not gonna go away yeah nobody feels it

2653.369 --> 2657.63
anymore but it's gonna come back

2654.71 --> 2660.36
guaranteed and like anybody ever getting

2657.63 --> 2661.92
a flu it's gonna be corona it's like the

2660.36 --> 2664.32
curse that'll never gonna go away and

2661.92 --> 2665.55
we're all gonna die eventually from it

2664.32 --> 2667.8900000000003
one way or another because they're gonna

2665.55 --> 2671.46
make while they're wilder claims about

2667.89 --> 2673.8599999999997
it how it is a like a degenerative

2671.46 --> 2676.11
disease like it keeps coming back and

2673.86 --> 2681.2400000000002
every time it's worse they will go and

2676.11 --> 2684.63
knee-length any madness they can think

2681.24 --> 2686.7299999999996
of in order to perpetuate the threat and

2684.63 --> 2690.6
the system that is tied into it that

2686.73 --> 2695.07
they can use to control things under the

2690.6 --> 2698.7599999999998
precedent of a medical threat that's

2695.07 --> 2701.6400000000003
right and it is a form it is medical

2698.76 --> 2703.3500000000004
martial law in a way but it can be soft

2701.64 --> 2706.16
medical martial law it can be hard

2703.35 --> 2711.6
medical martial law it seems to be more

2706.16 --> 2715.58
the soft version but the soft version to

2711.6 --> 2719.16
will literally just completely destroy

2715.58 --> 2721.56
societies it will financially ruin

2719.16 --> 2724.29
everyone and then Oh bailout situation

2721.56 --> 2726.93
financial panic depression and then

2724.29 --> 2729.69
maybe yeah what will happen well they're

2726.93 --> 2732.24
all just gonna freakin die or I don't

2729.69 --> 2735.63
know riot start their own communities do

2732.24 --> 2737.3689999999997
something or die or they're gonna our

2735.63 --> 2740.609
governments are gonna like try to force

2737.369 --> 2743.58
everybody with money and or bankers that

2740.609 --> 2745.47
aren't like the highest up to pay out

2743.58 --> 2746.7599999999998
and like pay for the damage they're

2745.47 --> 2748.89
gonna be pointed like you know you're

2746.76 --> 2754.4100000000003
gonna pay for that and then after that

2748.89 --> 2757.22
is over then a massive collapse because

2754.41 --> 2760.0099999999998
then suddenly nothing can be a

2757.22 --> 2763.04
held anymore insurances won't work

2760.01 --> 2766.369
anymore loans will not be given anymore

2763.04 --> 2774.68
because there is none available like

2766.369 --> 2777.05
that so this cannot be solved the issues

2774.68 --> 2780.91
they bring forth cannot be solved

2777.05 --> 2783.65
through what government is gonna suggest

2780.91 --> 2787.33
everything they will suggest is just

2783.65 --> 2787.33
gonna make it worse everything

2796.059 --> 2803.259
and I well not nothing about virus

2799.93 --> 2805.239
situation but the financial societal

2803.259 --> 2807.459
consequences everything they're gonna do

2805.239 --> 2811.839
in response to that is gonna make it

2807.459 --> 2814.269
worse the only thing the only thing that

2811.839 --> 2817.15
can really kind of save it is by a

2814.269 --> 2817.93
country just saying we're not gonna do

2817.15 --> 2822.099
this anymore

2817.93 --> 2823.959
screw you you want you oh you're gonna

2822.099 --> 2826.7490000000003
declare war on us or we're gonna be

2823.959 --> 2829.799
Outsiders now that's fine and dandy

2826.749 --> 2834.249
we'll just take care of ourselves and

2829.799 --> 2836.739
they will have to like really because

2834.249 --> 2838.4199999999996
they will be isolated then as a country

2836.739 --> 2841.479
but if the country can then still take

2838.42 --> 2846.039
care of itself then it's fine they don't

2841.479 --> 2847.299
do that then yeah it's just gonna be

2846.039 --> 2849.579
destroyed everything is going to be

2847.299 --> 2851.589
destroyed it's going to be neo fuel ISM

2849.579 --> 2852.9990000000003
people are gonna be as poor as in the

2851.589 --> 2854.68
freakin Middle Ages because they're

2852.999 --> 2857.91
literally not allowed to do anything

2854.68 --> 2864.269
anymore under threat of serious

2857.91 --> 2866.769
technologically advanced enforcement yay

2864.269 --> 2869.799
that's what's gonna happen when you just

2866.769 --> 2872.229
let it happen and it's gonna go very

2869.799 --> 2875.199
quickly I think it's not a matter of 10

2872.229 --> 2878.979
years for that [ __ ] if you let it happen

2875.199 --> 2882.7290000000003
it's probably gonna be fully deployed

2878.979 --> 2884.979
and doomed you will feel the doom in a

2882.729 --> 2888.91
span of two years something like that

2884.979 --> 2889.5989999999997
it'll drive very quickly if you all just

2888.91 --> 2893.699
let it happen

2889.599 --> 2893.699
if you just let them do it all

2905.74 --> 2910.1189999999997
so yeah it's up to you guys out there

2908.08 --> 2913.5099999999998
it's up to this the people in control

2910.119 --> 2917.02
the people listening the the planners

2913.51 --> 2919.2400000000002
the decision think tankers out there

2917.02 --> 2921.06
that are kind of like trying to figure

2919.24 --> 2924.58
out the best options for the

2921.06 --> 2927.91
Comptroller's or the the managers not

2924.58 --> 2931.63
really the controllers to make decisions

2927.91 --> 2933.49
yeah it's up to you it's like are you in

2931.63 --> 2936.88
or you out if you're in you're screwed

2933.49 --> 2942.3689999999997
are you out you're screwed but at least

2936.88 --> 2944.19
you could potentially stand a chance and

2942.369 --> 2947.26
if you're gonna do that you're gonna be

2944.19 --> 2949.09
besieged by media as a country very

2947.26 --> 2951.67
badly they're gonna throw in all the

2949.09 --> 2954.04
works they're gonna say all this this

2951.67 --> 2956.08
president or it could be anyone you know

2954.04 --> 2958.66
anybody that really steps outside says

2956.08 --> 2958.98
now is screw this we're not gonna do

2958.66 --> 2962.31
that

2958.98 --> 2965.95
absolutely not we're out there gonna be

2962.31 --> 2968.17
there a barrage by media like they are

2965.95 --> 2971.2
literally committing genocide on their

2968.17 --> 2973.869
own people that far and they're gonna

2971.2 --> 2976.8999999999996
even it might go as far as that they'll

2973.869 --> 2980.08
draw the draft in false footage from

2976.9 --> 2981.73
another place or another time and say

2980.08 --> 2986.7999999999997
that that is happening right now they

2981.73 --> 2990.21
will go absolutely not case nutcase on

2986.8 --> 2995.38
countries that are not cooperating

2990.21 --> 3000.45
because this is the world government it

2995.38 --> 3004.6800000000003
is and the media is the psychological

3000.45 --> 3006.8689999999997
enforcement arm it will literally bully

3004.68 --> 3009.75
everything until it's just so

3006.869 --> 3016.29
demoralized that it's just gonna break

3009.75 --> 3018.96
or surrender unless you have yeah

3016.29 --> 3022.2
consciousness of the grave situation

3018.96 --> 3024.66
that the world has arrived in if you

3022.2 --> 3028.2599999999998
really know if you can find the spirit

3024.66 --> 3030.6
and truly defend yourself with the

3028.26 --> 3033.9300000000003
long-term consequences and uphold the

3030.6 --> 3035.36
flame of Honor in the process it's the

3033.93 --> 3037.8199999999997
only way

3035.36 --> 3040.13
it's the only way and it's extremely

3037.82 --> 3042.5
dangerous but if you don't it's it's all

3040.13 --> 3046.28
gone everything is gone all the spirit

3042.5 --> 3049.19
all the all the spirit of your ancestors

3046.28 --> 3052.19
all of it it'll be all gone it's all

3049.19 --> 3054.14
gonna go away it's gonna go away in you

3052.19 --> 3056.27
eventually too because they'll start

3054.14 --> 3059.48
injecting you with [ __ ] and just melt

3056.27 --> 3062.63
parts of your brain until you're a husk

3059.48 --> 3064.34
until you're physically just incapable

3062.63 --> 3066.59
of even ascending to higher

3064.34 --> 3069.7000000000003
consciousness anymore that's what's

3066.59 --> 3082.04
gonna happen if you let it happen

3069.7 --> 3085.8399999999997
so yeah you choose you choose how would

3082.04 --> 3088.4
you practically resist them well finding

3085.84 --> 3091.04
talking with people speaking the truth

3088.4 --> 3093.89
about it don't get caught up on stupid

3091.04 --> 3094.58
Sevan yay attention-grabbing and get

3093.89 --> 3100.1299999999997
serious

3094.58 --> 3103.0699999999997
there you go we're doomed doomed no no

3100.13 --> 3107.06
it's like this okay these people these

3103.07 --> 3109.34
are doing that this is what is the

3107.06 --> 3110.99
response this is these are the problems

3109.34 --> 3114.1400000000003
here are the corruption nests that are

3110.99 --> 3116.1499999999996
letting it fester how do we do this get

3114.14 --> 3118.73
together and get more together and more

3116.15 --> 3124.51
and then organize it in the entire

3118.73 --> 3126.94
street and then a city and just yeah go

3124.51 --> 3130.2700000000004
go to the government buildings and just

3126.94 --> 3132.17
enforce the people's will on them say no

3130.27 --> 3140.09
you're all fired

3132.17 --> 3143.2400000000002
you're all fired just like that and a if

3140.09 --> 3145.79
the police gets in the way then

3143.24 --> 3147.56
everybody has a problem especially the

3145.79 --> 3151.49
police because what are they gonna do

3147.56 --> 3153.5299999999997
just take out the entire city population

3151.49 --> 3154.49
or like half of it or a quarter of it

3153.53 --> 3157.82
that's a lot

3154.49 --> 3160.8799999999997
what are they just gonna stop that from

3157.82 --> 3164.36
happening when they know what's really

3160.88 --> 3168.35
going down or if they're like that then

3164.36 --> 3169.13
they are basically demons with yeah with

3168.35 --> 3173.0
uniforms

3169.13 --> 3176.119
and then everybody has a problem and is

3173.0 --> 3178.91
probably going to be blood but if not if

3176.119 --> 3182.7200000000003
they have some remnant of their soul and

3178.91 --> 3185.99
wisdom left then they will join those

3182.72 --> 3187.339
people and say yeah freakin government

3185.99 --> 3192.1899999999996
I'm done with this [ __ ]

3187.339 --> 3196.759
I'm not gonna do it anymore but yeah

3192.19 --> 3200.66
what's gonna take like what is that

3196.759 --> 3203.69
critical momentum that certain people in

3200.66 --> 3207.319
a certain type of region will require to

3203.69 --> 3209.69
arrive at in order to be able to make

3207.319 --> 3212.509
that switch it's like how far will you

3209.69 --> 3216.98
be able to cook as a people before you

3212.509 --> 3219.799
snap and they will push it further and

3216.98 --> 3222.14
further further until you snap because

3219.799 --> 3226.069
it is the snap that are counting on that

3222.14 --> 3228.8289999999997
people will not snap into action but

3226.069 --> 3231.95
they will snap in out of their minds and

3228.829 --> 3232.759
into mine slavery that's really what

3231.95 --> 3238.25
they're hoping for

3232.759 --> 3243.849
and the problem is they have a chance of

3238.25 --> 3246.049
succeeding it's not a purely dead hope

3243.849 --> 3248.7200000000003
concerning that strategy even though it

3246.049 --> 3251.269
is a desperate desperate strategy it is

3248.72 --> 3255.799
a death bloom strategy but that doesn't

3251.269 --> 3258.859
mean that it can't succeed it's just

3255.799 --> 3262.88
it's war and though and the March has

3258.859 --> 3266.21
turned into a sprint it's war its war on

3262.88 --> 3270.069
the people this is the world government

3266.21 --> 3274.9
war on the people medical martial law

3270.069 --> 3282.079
people forced into financial services

3274.9 --> 3286.819
into social isolation for what for a

3282.079 --> 3289.63
less than lethal form of a flu makes no

3286.819 --> 3292.46
freaking sense it is medical martial law

3289.63 --> 3294.849
gradually being rolled out on most of

3292.46 --> 3294.849
the world

3300.71 --> 3307.5
right well it's not right it's not just

3304.77 --> 3311.0389999999998
waking up it's not even about waking up

3307.5 --> 3313.23
now it is about feeling the essence

3311.039 --> 3316.3190000000004
inside of you you know everybody's been

3313.23 --> 3318.539
conditioned been taught to just go along

3316.319 --> 3321.299
to get along to keep the stress inside

3318.539 --> 3323.88
to let the slander and [ __ ] in the

3321.299 --> 3326.91
blasphemy just happen so they can move

3323.88 --> 3329.819
beyond right so they're conditioned to

3326.91 --> 3332.91
have that response to atrocity and

3329.819 --> 3336.45
that's a problem can they bypass that

3332.91 --> 3339.089
conditioning can they stare at the

3336.45 --> 3342.93
atrocity at ease as it is getting ready

3339.089 --> 3345.18
to make the final blow to kill them will

3342.93 --> 3349.549
they be hypnotized because of their

3345.18 --> 3352.589
conditioning as they see it transpire or

3349.549 --> 3354.5389999999998
will they snap out of it

3352.589 --> 3356.73
break all the chains that have been

3354.539 --> 3360.329
gradually laid upon them their entire

3356.73 --> 3362.43
lives spiritual chains by society by

3360.329 --> 3365.0
family even by friends wherever will

3362.43 --> 3369.4199999999996
they break it at the last moment and

3365.0 --> 3371.46
just lash out and end it what's gonna

3369.42 --> 3372.6800000000003
happen people I don't know I don't know

3371.46 --> 3375.48
what's gonna happen

3372.68 --> 3379.529
concerning that but it does feel like

3375.48 --> 3381.869
this is just the final these are the

3379.529 --> 3385.38
final steps that will determine whether

3381.869 --> 3389.88
the world government will take control

3385.38 --> 3392.52
and create neo feudalism based on pure

3389.88 --> 3399.02
mind control and deception and medical

3392.52 --> 3402.599
martial law or if the people will be

3399.02 --> 3405.96
free on a slightly less tyrannical level

3402.599 --> 3407.6090000000004
for another period because it's not

3405.96 --> 3410.64
gonna be the last time trust me on that

3407.609 --> 3414.17
even if we do get out of it so yeah

3410.64 --> 3420.9
that's where we are this is the time

3414.17 --> 3423.529
this is the time it's it's it's all or

3420.9 --> 3423.529
nothing

3431.97 --> 3436.9599999999996
and personally I'm kind of eager to

3435.19 --> 3440.7400000000002
start organizing this [ __ ] I've had

3436.96 --> 3446.549
ideas I've had ideas I shared some of

3440.74 --> 3446.549
those ideas one of them would be yeah

3446.7 --> 3452.319
hey what is a good protest response

3450.19 --> 3453.19
movement to this nonsense the quarantine

3452.319 --> 3458.069
nonsense

3453.19 --> 3460.93
it is simple quarantine the government

3458.069 --> 3466.0
quarantine the government quarantine the

3460.93 --> 3469.299
government yeah and it will be a

3466.0 --> 3471.849
revolution but yeah when a government is

3469.299 --> 3477.39
there to literally take away everything

3471.849 --> 3484.089
and give nothing in return then a

3477.39 --> 3488.65
revolution is a matter of survival so

3484.089 --> 3492.19
yeah you know is it a revolution it's or

3488.65 --> 3495.579
is it just you could see it the other

3492.19 --> 3499.15
way the government is the one the

3495.579 --> 3502.3900000000003
government these these groups they are

3499.15 --> 3506.44
the one engaging in a revolution not the

3502.39 --> 3511.18
people people are the ones that are left

3506.44 --> 3514.779
to defend it or break so the government

3511.18 --> 3519.0
and the media the media is basically

3514.779 --> 3524.74
their arm their little puppet boy and

3519.0 --> 3536.5
the medical system they are performing

3524.74 --> 3539.2589999999996
the revolutionary please stop I think

3536.5 --> 3543.339
this is fun think this is fun that is

3539.259 --> 3545.799
gonna yield some kind of good moment you

3543.339 --> 3548.619
think that if we get out of it it's like

3545.799 --> 3552.43
oh yeah finally I'm gonna get my dream

3548.619 --> 3556.05
it's gonna be a great no absolutely not

3552.43 --> 3560.7
it's gonna be [ __ ] anyway yeah

3556.05 --> 3564.4300000000003
it's just gonna not be the end [ __ ] so

3560.7 --> 3568.33
don't don't go uh we're gonna have this

3564.43 --> 3572.3199999999997
we're gonna no absolutely not no this is

3568.33 --> 3575.58
just about not dying on the short run

3572.32 --> 3578.65
that's it you're not gonna get your

3575.58 --> 3582.7
great new reformed government system out

3578.65 --> 3585.37
of it absolutely not absolutely not no

3582.7 --> 3588.3999999999996
matter what happens there's not gonna be

3585.37 --> 3592.45
an advancement this is only about not

3588.4 --> 3594.9700000000003
dying on the short run okay people so

3592.45 --> 3597.46
don't you dare start to get all

3594.97 --> 3599.2599999999998
fantastical about oh there could be so

3597.46 --> 3603.3
much thing we can get out of this no

3599.26 --> 3603.3
this is about survival people

3615.62 --> 3625.1
it just needs to stop the nonsense needs

3619.01 --> 3628.4900000000002
to stop and people can't just stand by

3625.1 --> 3632.69
and just let them get away with it

3628.49 --> 3635.6899999999996
anyway and just saying things and being

3632.69 --> 3639.35
ignored in what you with what you say is

3635.69 --> 3645.92
also not gonna suffice anymore it must

3639.35 --> 3648.5299999999997
stop it's as simple as that and if words

3645.92 --> 3651.7000000000003
are not gonna stop it then physical

3648.53 --> 3651.7000000000003
actions must stop it

3661.44 --> 3664.559
you're right

3672.99 --> 3678.02
oh you should write a certain you should

3675.48 --> 3678.02
be afraid

3692.37 --> 3697.3489999999997
[Music]

3694.069 --> 3700.859

3703.549 --> 3711.269
autocratic neo feudal system of mind

3707.519 --> 3714.359
control where every functionary is gonna

3711.269 --> 3717.45
tell you exactly how you need to think

3714.359 --> 3721.43
how you need to feel and how to do your

3717.45 --> 3725.3689999999997
minor actions enjoy that toady UK in

with your drone slave comrades have fun

3730.38 --> 3736.5
with that with your non-physical action

3734.25 --> 3736.89
you have fun with your pacifism over

3736.5 --> 3739.38
there

3736.89 --> 3742.049
well you become one of the most

3739.38 --> 3742.44
autocratic states the world has ever

3742.049 --> 3752.7889999999998
seen

3742.44 --> 3758.2200000000003

going to get a lot more of it

3761.24 --> 3768.029
so yeah you just stay pacifist you just

3764.88 --> 3772.2200000000003
sit it out sitting it out we'll make it

3768.029 --> 3772.22
go away right mm-hmm

3772.37 --> 3775.42
[Music]

3778.55 --> 3782.619
[Music]

3804.5 --> 3812.12
you think so speeders is easy think that

3809.45 --> 3816.77
mind-control is nice really

3812.12 --> 3820.8199999999997
you like being driven around like a

3816.77 --> 3823.99
robot not having any say over the way

3820.82 --> 3827.53
you even conduct yourself you like that

3823.99 --> 3827.5299999999997
think that's Pleasant

3838.65 --> 3841.7490000000003
[Music]

3843.6 --> 3848.06
all right Jeffrey bill yeah yep it does

3852.54 --> 3861.23
well it's his govern mind government

3856.44 --> 3861.23
basically comes down to govern mind

3861.89 --> 3869.2799999999997
governing is steering it's based it's

3866.94 --> 3872.96
like what a governor does it's like you

3869.28 --> 3876.75
control the decision the flow the plan

3872.96 --> 3880.7400000000002
so govern mind is basically laying out

3876.75 --> 3883.88
the plan for the mind to follow yeah

3880.74 --> 3883.8799999999997
makes perfect sense

3886.62 --> 3889.699
[Music]

3906.19 --> 3912.9700000000003
now Jonah opt-out pessimistic no there's

3910.96 --> 3915.1
two responses to what I just did here

3912.97 --> 3917.23
either people are gonna spiral out of

3915.1 --> 3919.48
control and basically [ __ ] their pants

3917.23 --> 3923.53
they might not share it probably not the

3919.48 --> 3932.5
people in chat here not and yeah they

3923.53 --> 3934.51
will just today yeah oh go away just go

3932.5 --> 3939.43
sit in the garbage somewhere in your own

3934.51 --> 3943.9300000000003
feces I don't give a [ __ ] literally but

3939.43 --> 3948.72
yeah other people may just start to

3943.93 --> 3953.43
realize like yeah this seems extremely

3948.72 --> 3956.0499999999997
unusually overt you know media has been

3953.43 --> 3957.8199999999997
government has done some weird overt

3956.05 --> 3960.5800000000004
information placements where they were

3957.82 --> 3965.65
basically just saying it like yeah we're

3960.58 --> 3968.86
gonna do this let it wait ignore inquiry

3965.65 --> 3971.35
about it and then just it suddenly

3968.86 --> 3973.42
happens and nobody knows why well even

3971.35 --> 3976.15
they know then and yeah that's happened

3973.42 --> 3980.76
about this this is that to the next

3976.15 --> 3980.76
level this is not seen like this before

3980.97 --> 3988.29
so yeah

3988.8 --> 3996.0
death or slavery that's right yeah I

3992.49 --> 3998.6
know you will tell you K the slavery has

3996.0 --> 4006.5
already been very thick on you

3998.6 --> 4008.72
emphasizing the thick part so yeah yeah

4006.5 --> 4013.82
but this the thing you see about that

4008.72 --> 4015.6499999999996
the death or slavery part is that

4013.82 --> 4018.32
doesn't necessarily have to mean your

4015.65 --> 4026.26
death it just means that something's got

4018.32 --> 4026.26
to give and hey you know

4030.339 --> 4036.549
at everything I fought for in my entire

4033.369 --> 4039.489
life is to literally be able to be free

4036.549 --> 4040.39
minded to keep my smarts about to keep

4039.489 --> 4042.549
my soul

4040.39 --> 4044.5589999999997
despite the insanity of this freakin

4042.549 --> 4047.589
world surrounding me in just the mind of

4044.559 --> 4051.219
everybody going completely demonic or

4047.589 --> 4053.049
slightly demonic it's just like what it

4051.219 --> 4056.349
is to be a normal human being has

4053.049 --> 4060.43
culturally eroded to severe levels and

4056.349 --> 4064.1800000000003
it's been punishing me for like ten

4060.43 --> 4066.009
years on a daily basis to deal with it

4064.18 --> 4070.779
it's like yeah everybody is freaking

4066.009 --> 4072.309
insane on a social emotional level

4070.779 --> 4075.279
almost everyone

4072.309 --> 4078.9300000000003
it's just severe problems and it's not

4075.279 --> 4082.239
even these are not like personal hidden

4078.93 --> 4084.969
craziness you know like 40 years ago

4082.239 --> 4087.2490000000003
thirty years ago there was it was even

4084.969 --> 4089.589
my parents news like okay yeah everybody

4087.249 --> 4091.569
has their crazy traits you know it's

4089.589 --> 4094.119
like a person will seem perfectly normal

4091.569 --> 4096.159
but they might have had this one period

4094.119 --> 4098.1990000000005
in their life where they that's went

4096.159 --> 4100.42
through something shocking and then

4098.199 --> 4102.489
suddenly it might come out and they may

4100.42 --> 4105.13
show unusual behavior you know that that

4102.489 --> 4105.8189999999995
type of craziness well it's not like

4105.13 --> 4110.049
that anymore

4105.819 --> 4114.6990000000005
no people thou throw their craziness out

4110.049 --> 4117.67
like it's normal and they even like try

4114.699 --> 4126.509
to cash in on it and it's like yeah

4117.67 --> 4128.859
being crazy is a financial strategy yay

4126.509 --> 4131.65
yeah that's so great

4128.859 --> 4139.2390000000005
that's just freakin brilliant that's

4131.65 --> 4143.379999999999
gonna help a lot not it's ridiculous so

4139.239 --> 4148.0289999999995
yeah that is it's been a very punishing

4143.38 --> 4154.75
to me our society has gradually degraded

4148.029 --> 4157.27
like that how honor is scoffed at or not

4154.75 --> 4159.79
spoken about it's like there are still

4157.27 --> 4162.7300000000005
people even understanding it but they're

4159.79 --> 4164.009
not going to be championing it verbally

4162.73 --> 4168.509
in public No

4164.009 --> 4171.23
but he does it anymore nobody I feel

4168.509 --> 4174.839
like I'm like the only one here that

4171.23 --> 4188.73
does that [ __ ] and it's not appreciated

4174.839 --> 4191.609
when I do it it's it creeps me out talk

4188.73 --> 4195.78
of violence I'm talking of violence

4191.609 --> 4202.2300000000005
really would what what what exactly what

4195.78 --> 4203.82
violent act I was being metaphorical

4202.23 --> 4207.619
earlier with the violence that was a

4203.82 --> 4210.98
metaphor right it's the monster the

4207.619 --> 4214.289
government media medical system

4210.98 --> 4218.369
conspiracy it is a conspiracy

4214.289 --> 4222.09
they are conspiring yes provably so

4218.369 --> 4224.308999999999
coordinated planned conspiracy this is

4222.09 --> 4227.57
not theoretical this is absolute

4224.309 --> 4232.8
empirical fact that it is a conspiracy

4227.57 --> 4234.9
they are taking a big swing with a giant

4232.8 --> 4239.1900000000005
axe to work you or are you going to be

4234.9 --> 4242.07
hypnotized from like the overt nastiness

4239.19 --> 4244.11
of the situation like no way this can't

4242.07 --> 4247.349
be happening and then gonna strobe be

4244.11 --> 4249.449
struck dead by it or are you gonna get

4247.349 --> 4253.4890000000005
out of the way and and basically take

4249.449 --> 4255.9
him down or at least like punch him

4253.489 --> 4258.48
disarmed amor something you know punch

4255.9 --> 4260.009999999999
him until they and then let go of the

4258.48 --> 4262.289
axe so you can take the axe away

4260.01 --> 4265.079000000001
something like that see that that is it

4262.289 --> 4271.829
was metaphorical I've never said to

4265.079 --> 4277.469
anyone to literally commit violence you

4271.829 --> 4279.058999999999
know it's like even if I say I'm gonna

4277.469 --> 4281.909
freakin punch you in the face or

4279.059 --> 4285.0
something you know that even if I did

4281.909 --> 4288.539
that I would never punch somebody in a

4285.0 --> 4291.51
way that they would really get like

4288.539 --> 4296.369
something broken or I would not dare do

4291.51 --> 4297.689
that especially out of anger no way no

4296.369 --> 4301.86
freakin way

4297.689 --> 4305.76
no I will never do damage to anyone even

4301.86 --> 4309.32
if I'm angry except if they are just

4305.76 --> 4312.659000000001
possessed or contracted to literally

4309.32 --> 4315.11
damage me you know and you can sense

4312.659 --> 4317.909
that when somebody then it's like death

4315.11 --> 4320.179
shines through them and then I might be

4317.909 --> 4324.478999999999
inclined to literally just suddenly

4320.179 --> 4329.209
Berserker bash just to prevent dying you

4324.479 --> 4331.9490000000005
know but I would never like initiate

4329.209 --> 4334.019
serious violence like that never and

4331.949 --> 4338.329
never tell anybody to do that know that

4334.019 --> 4344.599
you don't need to I use diplomacy I use

4338.329 --> 4349.789
for site inside tactics trust honor

4344.599 --> 4352.679
community those are also a potential

4349.789 --> 4354.3
effective tool it's not really a weapon

4352.679 --> 4356.189
but it is a tool sometimes you don't

4354.3 --> 4358.34
need you don't need a weapon you just

4356.189 --> 4362.099
need the right tools to get it done

4358.34 --> 4365.099
that's my personal strategy and a way to

4362.099 --> 4368.669
do it is to say okay quarantine the

4365.099 --> 4370.53
government remember it's what is it

4368.669 --> 4372.929
occupy wall street

4370.53 --> 4376.079
remember that occupy wall street how

4372.929 --> 4377.999
that worked how suddenly how wide it

4376.079 --> 4379.829
spread out even though it wasn't really

4377.999 --> 4384.209
successful it was all mostly a bunch of

4379.829 --> 4386.188999999999
hippies but yeah Occupy Wall Street did

4384.209 --> 4388.619
spread quickly and there was good reason

4386.189 --> 4389.360000000001
for it it was a thing and it spread

4388.619 --> 4393.53
worldwide

4389.36 --> 4398.909
well how about quarantine government

4393.53 --> 4402.449
quarantine government yeah it it it can

4398.909 --> 4406.888999999999
be done we can do it the people can do

4402.449 --> 4410.308999999999
it they can stop it saying okay we're

4406.889 --> 4412.019
done with the [ __ ] you we're gonna

4410.309 --> 4412.619000000001
quarantine you you're not gonna get out

4412.019 --> 4414.900000000001
of there

4412.619 --> 4416.699
we're not gonna let you go home you're

4414.9 --> 4422.61
all gonna sit there in your government

4416.699 --> 4425.938999999999
building and you're quarantined until ya

4422.61 --> 4429.228999999999
measures are taken that this nonsense is

4425.939 --> 4429.229
not gonna continue anymore

4429.75 --> 4444.219
like that is that violence I don't think

4439.27 --> 4445.540000000001
so well hey that's Reiner thornton

4444.219 --> 4447.219
that's okay

4445.54 --> 4449.67
you know hey if you're surrounded by

4447.219 --> 4452.5
sheep and they're not gonna do it I

4449.67 --> 4454.84
recommend to get the hell out of there

4452.5 --> 4459.37
cuz they're probably all gonna end up

4454.84 --> 4461.59
dead because if you're not gonna do this

4459.37 --> 4463.48
if you're just gonna let it happen and

4461.59 --> 4464.110000000001
let all the economy around you be

4463.48 --> 4466.629999999999
destroyed

4464.11 --> 4470.08
yeah food's gonna run out what you think

4466.63 --> 4477.179
is gonna happen huh

4470.08 --> 4477.179
what you think is gonna happen yeah I

4478.77 --> 4484.900000000001
think that sheep even sheep when they

4483.1 --> 4487.84
simply don't have any more food

4484.9 --> 4493.53
available to them they will restart

4487.84 --> 4496.179
eventually start eating meat so yeah

4493.53 --> 4499.03
they will at least try I think I'm not

4496.179 --> 4501.04
too sure though maybe they will give up

4499.03 --> 4506.86
and die that could be to I don't know

4501.04 --> 4509.89
about sheep I just could imagine that if

4506.86 --> 4511.389999999999
a creature has enough survival instinct

4509.89 --> 4513.55
that they will continue on no matter

4511.39 --> 4515.58
what that they would probably against

4513.55 --> 4518.05
their nature try to eat things that are

4515.58 --> 4521.08
normally not healthy for them just to

4518.05 --> 4525.51
have this extra chance to maybe survive

4521.08 --> 4525.51
I don't know so even sheep

4532.08 --> 4538.36
diversity will never allow that to

4534.28 --> 4541.17
heaven I really wanted well it not

4538.36 --> 4541.17
really

4558.3 --> 4563.6900000000005
what does that mean speeders II

4586.56 --> 4594.27
Wow I see you guys are properly

4589.87 --> 4594.2699999999995
spiraling over everything I just said

4599.16 --> 4607.47
but what is ASMR can somebody please

4603.01 --> 4607.47
elaborate [ __ ] sake

4616.12 --> 4620.91
I still dug that still doesn't tell me

4618.31 --> 4620.910000000001
what it means

4632.61 --> 4636.25
Wow

4634.0 --> 4644.59
even the definition doesn't say what it

4636.25 --> 4651.49
actually stands for it's ridiculous it's

4644.59 --> 4653.860000000001
just called ASMR oh okay sure it's just

4651.49 --> 4655.78
random letters it's just yeah that's

4653.86 --> 4658.57
what it is it's random letters and you

4655.78 --> 4662.08
there's a description it's just no no

4658.57 --> 4666.549999999999
where what audio studio mixed relaxation

4662.08 --> 4669.25
oh okay thank you glad you got that I

4666.55 --> 4673.53
didn't say it didn't say right over here

4669.25 --> 4673.53
so when I googled it

4682.38 --> 4686.64
autonomous sensory Meridian response

4687.66 --> 4694.8099999999995
alright okay well apparently I wasn't

4692.41 --> 4698.07
able to find it but I guess everybody

4694.81 --> 4698.070000000001
knows except me

4721.659 --> 4733.138999999999
so it is kind of like a meditation

4724.9 --> 4735.728999999999
background music sound just nice

4733.139 --> 4736.719
relaxing background sound stuff like

4735.729 --> 4740.55
that right

4736.719 --> 4740.55
is that ASMR

4747.28 --> 4758.829
Oh does not music it's just sound

4755.92 --> 4764.9490000000005
background sound alright so like yeah

4758.829 --> 4766.869
work Street work or people sitting in

4764.949 --> 4769.388999999999
the park and birds everywhere or a

4766.869 --> 4771.639
waterfall like situation that let's just

4769.389 --> 4777.46
background sound that is relaxing okay I

4771.639 --> 4780.34
think I get it now get a live baby

4777.46 --> 4782.789
screaming or you can just get Paul on

4780.34 --> 4782.789
the panel

4802.26 --> 4808.4400000000005
hamster chewing what

4805.949 --> 4812.009999999999
that's weird so it is basically just

4808.44 --> 4815.33
recorded sounds it can be a lot of

4812.01 --> 4821.900000000001
things sipping tea oh my god really

4815.33 --> 4821.9
that's that's just weird

4833.11 --> 4838.91
well I like birds children especially

4837.11 --> 4842.17
like the really little birds they have

4838.91 --> 4847.37
like these super high pitch sounds and

4842.17 --> 4852.46
it it just does something to the back of

4847.37 --> 4852.46
my mind that feels really invigorating

4872.08 --> 4879.92
yeah dinosaur Falcon I am a little

4874.88 --> 4883.159000000001
confused about all this said I'm not

4879.92 --> 4887.4800000000005
into i--listen music ok I like music I

4883.159 --> 4890.7699999999995
come from a all generation where people

4887.48 --> 4895.879999999999
actually used to listen to sounds that

4890.77 --> 4898.719
were not natural but they just put it

4895.88 --> 4901.55
together in a way that had a rhythm and

4898.719 --> 4904.429
it's like a bird singing except it's

4901.55 --> 4907.849
controlled and mechanized and it was

4904.429 --> 4910.46
called a song back in the day music I

4907.849 --> 4912.56
know I know it's such a Boomer thing

4910.46 --> 4915.5
music is for old people

4912.56 --> 4918.610000000001
I know you just listen to recorded

4915.5 --> 4918.61
sounds now

4936.41 --> 4944.21
I bet there's like a SMRs of giggly

4941.03 --> 4947.87
girls I kind of have one right now it's

4944.21 --> 4949.82
like yeah my roommate and his girlfriend

4947.87 --> 4951.71
are like well they're hanging around

4949.82 --> 4955.28
there a lot and she gets giggly like a

4951.71 --> 4959.53
lot but it is fun to hear so I bet

4955.28 --> 4959.53
there's ASMR zuv giggly girls as well

4962.23 --> 4969.879999999999
man that would probably get like young

4965.87 --> 4969.88
guys just hi listening to that

4988.449 --> 4999.178999999999
okay so you guys think that I have a

4990.79 --> 5002.31
potential ASMR voice sure I could read I

4999.179 --> 5004.89
it's not my best quality but I could

5002.31 --> 5009.6
definitely definitely put some extra

5004.89 --> 5015.570000000001
effort into my voice maybe warm it up a

5009.6 --> 5016.05
little before hand and then do that kind

5015.57 --> 5022.0199999999995
of thing

5016.05 --> 5024.66
no not ASMR sip please besides why would

5022.02 --> 5027.660000000001
you need an a so like people could

5024.66 --> 5029.4
literally just extract every sound that

5027.66 --> 5032.13
I ever made on the early bird show

5029.4 --> 5038.549999999999
sipping my tea and then just make a

5032.13 --> 5042.03
continual probably 10 minute clip this

5038.55 --> 5046.1990000000005
sound click bite of that then you got

5042.03 --> 5048.62
your hour wind sipping tea ASMR so have

5046.199 --> 5048.62
fun with that

5063.71 --> 5078.19
my voice is too squeaky my voice is too

5067.969 --> 5078.19
squeek - squeek you sit down not really

5078.67 --> 5083.29
no but if I clear my throat properly

5085.42 --> 5095.68
then I can muster forth all kinds of

5089.45 --> 5099.429999999999
very low sounding yet consistent voice

5095.68 --> 5104.08
sounds of all kinds and I can do reading

5099.43 --> 5107.4800000000005
so I have pretty good voice control if I

5104.08 --> 5116.15
have sufficient reason to utilize it as

5107.48 --> 5118.25
it were but yeah I'm not gonna SM ours

5116.15 --> 5121.879999999999
are probably not best done during flu

5118.25 --> 5124.219
season an allergy season it would

5121.88 --> 5126.82
probably be best recorded for me in the

5124.219 --> 5126.82
middle of summer

5133.39 --> 5146.33
Thank You Amanda young read the opening

5140.69 --> 5148.9
lines of Hobbit to us really I don't

5146.33 --> 5148.9
have the book

5162.33 --> 5169.32
I I know I I didn't I

5166.34 --> 5172.1900000000005
I've read Lord of the Rings I don't I

5169.32 --> 5176.12
don't really like The Hobbit that much

5172.19 --> 5176.12
it's still ridiculous

5190.389 --> 5200.229
I know what it is it was read to me as a

5193.78 --> 5201.999
kid by my mother but I did read by my

5200.229 --> 5208.499000000001
own volition the Lord of the Rings book

5201.999 --> 5208.499
books just like a decent pile of paper

5216.03 --> 5222.789
no no I don't sound like Smeagol unless

5219.939 --> 5224.34
I want to sound like Smeagol I can

5222.789 --> 5228.36
definitely do that

5224.34 --> 5228.360000000001
takes a little practice though

5231.49 --> 5234.55
[Music]

5242.28 --> 5251.429999999999
the hobbits to Asgard now I mean I think

5246.37 --> 5255.36
you mean Isengard but s Curtis

5251.43 --> 5255.360000000001
that's another universe

5262.49 --> 5271.46
no no no my squeaky voice my squeaky

5266.33 --> 5275.54
voice is more of a goblin voice our

5271.46 --> 5281.36
small tower that's available for and for

5275.54 --> 5283.09
us it's just a different way to make the

5281.36 --> 5293.889999999999
sound come through your mouth it's just

5283.09 --> 5297.4400000000005
no that's not my voice but has time and

5293.89 --> 5299.81
no I'm not the original voice actor of

5297.44 --> 5302.11
the Smeagol character don't worry about

5299.81 --> 5302.110000000001
it

5306.0 --> 5309.109
[Music]

5319.84 --> 5325.2
I know I know totally okay I know that

5323.02 --> 5330.55
you're not joking and that I can do it

5325.2 --> 5334.51
because I have capability to do voices

5330.55 --> 5336.52
on a relatively high level I have that

5334.51 --> 5340.45
ability I've had it since I was a very

5336.52 --> 5344.92
little kid I would do voices when I was

5340.45 --> 5347.92
six I would start to imitate things that

5344.92 --> 5351.79
I saw on the telly literally do their

5347.92 --> 5354.79
voices some I even started out copying

5351.79 --> 5357.58
English just phonetically and that [ __ ]

5354.79 --> 5359.29
it was like literal parrot as the kid I

5357.58 --> 5361.35
didn't even understand what I would be

5359.29 --> 5365.37
saying but I could parrot it perfectly

5361.35 --> 5365.370000000001
because I have that capability

5375.169 --> 5381.929
right well tell you case yeah I get the

5378.599 --> 5383.639
infliction the way he talks I get it

5381.929 --> 5389.789
because I pay attention

5383.639 --> 5392.249
I hear the details I it's critical the

5389.789 --> 5395.789
way the voice is conducted the way you

5392.249 --> 5401.429
go up and down all that it is critical

5395.789 --> 5404.61
it is it it reveals the essence of the

5401.429 --> 5407.6990000000005
spirit of the person or the character as

5404.61 --> 5410.4
it is expressed in the wake of voices

5407.699 --> 5413.369
are conducted tension can be derived

5410.4 --> 5415.379999999999
from that you can hear it in the voice

5413.369 --> 5417.509999999999
the way they handles that they are under

5415.38 --> 5419.309
tension of a certain type and that is

5417.51 --> 5423.150000000001
something that really came forward with

5419.309 --> 5426.659000000001
Smeagol you could hear he had he was

5423.15 --> 5431.28
insane he was broken inside you could

5426.659 --> 5437.638999999999
hear it the way he spoke it was a very

5431.28 --> 5441.36
well developed character and it's

5437.639 --> 5445.409000000001
interesting to know because they created

5441.36 --> 5449.728999999999
that there look in the book it's just

5445.409 --> 5452.098999999999
the way he talks the way he thinks that

5449.729 --> 5456.059
was Smeagol in the book it's like this

5452.099 --> 5460.07
dark lost mind but in the movie they

5456.059 --> 5463.469
made that voice they created another

5460.07 --> 5466.679
dimension to the concept of Smeagol the

5463.469 --> 5469.709
character and it's pretty awesome and it

5466.679 --> 5473.51
was really well done in my opinion they

5469.709 --> 5473.51
really gave it in another dimension

5486.42 --> 5495.17
why okay good for you totally okay I can

5490.53 --> 5495.17
do voices I'm glad you know that now

5500.62 --> 5510.62
and so I've even tried to do like do

5505.97 --> 5514.7300000000005
Nathan Oakley but that's too tough but

5510.62 --> 5517.79
I've actually tried it it's like really

5514.73 --> 5521.8099999999995
just switching and then just becoming

5517.79 --> 5524.81
like that but it's it's too tough he's

5521.81 --> 5530.150000000001
too well-spoken and to British I can't I

5524.81 --> 5532.79
can't do it like that I would just sound

5530.15 --> 5539.239
like a like British and not like him I

5532.79 --> 5547.489
couldn't do that like that but he has a

5539.239 --> 5551.259999999999
very distinct way of talking open the

5547.489 --> 5551.259999999999
line and have a voice of what

5589.619 --> 5592.619
really

5596.82 --> 5610.259999999999
I don't know I can do all kinds of

5605.34 --> 5614.4890000000005
voices it's just that I I tend to not

5610.26 --> 5616.71
like a lot of voices now it's rare for

5614.489 --> 5619.379999999999
me to find an interesting voice with a

5616.71 --> 5624.719
character that that I'll be willing to

5619.38 --> 5626.52
assimilate as where does a lot

5624.719 --> 5629.969
especially like cartoon characters

5626.52 --> 5632.719
they're just annoying stereotypes now a

5629.969 --> 5632.719
lot of them

5641.63 --> 5650.58
but yeah but besides emulating special

5646.68 --> 5652.9800000000005
voices and I can do it it's I don't know

5650.58 --> 5655.08
I can do it a little it is it's

5652.98 --> 5659.37
necessary okay I'm a game master

5655.08 --> 5661.83
I do D and E I need to be able to on the

5659.37 --> 5665.19
spot just like okay I need the voice of

5661.83 --> 5668.79
a dwarf I'm just gonna be a Scottish

5665.19 --> 5670.949
dwarf type it's kind of stereotype but

5668.79 --> 5674.64
it works you know

5670.949 --> 5676.44
and or an elf and then just talk

5674.64 --> 5683.85
slightly more smoothly

5676.44 --> 5687.75
and all kinds of things it's just I have

5683.85 --> 5691.7390000000005
to be able to yeah make voices on the

5687.75 --> 5693.96
spot and graph things together and if it

5691.739 --> 5696.12
is slightly familiar it'll work really

5693.96 --> 5697.86
quickly it might not be very original

5696.12 --> 5700.92
but it will work really quickly on the

5697.86 --> 5704.3099999999995
spot to basically certainly manifest a

5700.92 --> 5705.81
character that is gonna potentially play

5704.31 --> 5708.27
a part in the future in that game and

5705.81 --> 5718.9800000000005
NPC how you have to create a lot of NPC

5708.27 --> 5722.25
voices just on the spot but I can also

5718.98 --> 5723.98
and that's another thing capture the

5722.25 --> 5729.12
spirit of something

5723.98 --> 5733.199
it's like certain types of I don't know

5729.12 --> 5737.5199999999995
movie characters sometimes they have a

5733.199 --> 5740.16
like a very specific overarching trait

5737.52 --> 5745.56
that really radiates off it well I can

5740.16 --> 5750.8099999999995
typically emulate that I get it it's

5745.56 --> 5754.26
like getting their spirit and then just

5750.81 --> 5758.85
acting like that you don't even have to

5754.26 --> 5760.5
like yeah be like them it or be

5758.85 --> 5764.160000000001
literally that I'm not pretending to

5760.5 --> 5767.07
literally be them but just be like that

5764.16 --> 5771.869
exactly like that like be like the

5767.07 --> 5777.69
behavior so I can do that too

5771.869 --> 5780.0599999999995
I know it's did I guess falls under

5777.69 --> 5782.699
acting capability I've always had that

5780.06 --> 5785.31
in me you know there were points when I

5782.699 --> 5789.719
didn't want to become an actor till I

5785.31 --> 5793.469
figured out that yeah you'd have to do

5789.719 --> 5795.889
certain things that I just really really

5793.469 --> 5795.889
don't wanna

5803.5 --> 5810.52
do I think it PJ isn't actually a good

5807.28 --> 5814.0199999999995
hand good singer really I didn't know

5810.52 --> 5814.02
that's weird

5823.45 --> 5837.65
Dell Dell is such a puppet man that's a

5833.75 --> 5840.85
guy this has just extremely little to

5837.65 --> 5840.849999999999
bring to the table really

5861.15 --> 5863.96
all right

5864.63 --> 5872.04
well hope it can be extremely annoying

5867.99 --> 5877.55
Drona SH though yes Jeffrey bill that

5872.04 --> 5882.35
one yeah but we all know that del is

5877.55 --> 5885.0
aggro basically out of self-defense

5882.35 --> 5887.01
because he just gets like that when he

5885.0 --> 5889.77
kind of like doesn't really know what to

5887.01 --> 5894.570000000001
do anymore which kind of happens a lot

5889.77 --> 5900.080000000001
I get the feeling so it's just a grow as

5894.57 --> 5900.08
a as a standard response

5903.66 --> 5906.79
[Music]

5915.57 --> 5919.88

5979.15 --> 5985.599999999999
came on this show and he said some

5981.1 --> 5988.6
really in naughty things I was on his

5985.6 --> 5991.4800000000005
show one time but that's like three

5988.6 --> 5995.77
years ago maybe four was way back in the

5991.48 --> 6002.94
beginning when I really didn't know who

5995.77 --> 6006.5
he was yet but yeah I think really

6002.94 --> 6014.61
checked him out ever since it's just

6006.5 --> 6019.05
missing out really no thanks teddy no

6014.61 --> 6021.54
thanks I already have to watch him do

6019.05 --> 6025.38

flick on ran T's he's over there or the

6025.38 --> 6036.659000000001
Jose's s everywhere but he's always

6028.739 --> 6046.32
doing the same thing like always okay if

6036.659 --> 6054.239
you say so dang I just I'm just the guy

6046.32 --> 6058.67
doesn't really appeal to me all right

6054.239 --> 6058.669999999999
be right back in two minutes

6218.139 --> 6227.56

it's going on that's how de ok shut up

6227.56 --> 6232.570000000001
don't freaking tell me what the hell to

6230.09 --> 6232.57
do ok

6244.53 --> 6251.03
I don't know made your tongue I don't

6247.29 --> 6251.03
think it's anything to worry about I

6257.89 --> 6261.229
[Music]

6264.08 --> 6273.42
didn't think it was a funny joke I don't

6270.87 --> 6281.16
think being told what to do is funny

6273.42 --> 6284.16
joke but that's okay it's like are you

6281.16 --> 6288.12
really gonna joke about that toady while

6284.16 --> 6293.34
your country is literally being turned

6288.12 --> 6295.68
into into a neo few little slave pit so

6293.34 --> 6296.1900000000005
how can you think that saying that is

6295.68 --> 6298.650000000001
funny

6296.19 --> 6303.12
when people are literally getting [ __ ]

6298.65 --> 6306.36
up over that [ __ ] I don't see that is

6303.12 --> 6309.9
why I object it's like it's not funny

6306.36 --> 6312.089999999999
that you say it you know if somebody

6309.9 --> 6313.5
like Nathan said it I know it would be

6312.09 --> 6318.95
pure sarcasm

6313.5 --> 6318.95
they really B's but with you dude

6337.13 --> 6343.719
oh really so who is that Jordan uptown

6339.409 --> 6343.719
or is that you included

6364.649 --> 6371.959000000001
yeah it's a it's a good-enough now I

6372.019 --> 6377.55
basically explain to you that it's not a

6374.999 --> 6381.719
funny joke when you say it because

6377.55 --> 6386.099
everything that I talked about like your

6381.719 --> 6388.8
country is under severe mind-control

6386.099 --> 6391.789
assault with this nonsense so how is

6388.8 --> 6394.8
saying that even funny at this point

6391.789 --> 6398.879
when it's literally being assaulted with

6394.8 --> 6402.419
that stuff I just don't get how you can

6398.879 --> 6407.809
say that thinking it is funny in the

6402.419 --> 6407.809
scenario that you're at see it's just

6420.96 --> 6427.17
oh are they are they made you Tom are

6423.57 --> 6431.28

6434.19 --> 6442.11
from the Corona fires you tell me did

6437.52 --> 6444.96
they die from the corona virus or did

6442.11 --> 6449.16
they die from toxic shock

6444.96 --> 6454.44
maybe vaccine type of thing something

6449.16 --> 6456.45
else I don't know really what's your

6454.44 --> 6456.929999999999
proof what's your proof show me the

6456.45 --> 6459.63
proof

6456.93 --> 6464.81
show me the medical report that says

6459.63 --> 6468.63
died due to virus and then with

6464.81 --> 6471.4800000000005
clinically like how that happened how

6468.63 --> 6474.4800000000005
did that happen or is it just a this kid

6471.48 --> 6476.28
yeah they died and and oh look they

6474.48 --> 6480.259999999999

really he did tell me all about it

6501.27 --> 6506.639
where's your proof where's the proof

6507.449 --> 6510.989
show me the proof

6518.239 --> 6527.138999999999
is your proof that you heard it on a

6520.34 --> 6527.139
news bulletin did you

6541.419 --> 6546.099
really if it was a medical worker you

6544.329 --> 6549.579
would be able to show the report so

6546.099 --> 6552.2390000000005
there is no medical report as to how it

6549.579 --> 6555.849
was concluded that the boy died of

6552.239 --> 6559.119
coronavirus there's just nothing well

6555.849 --> 6563.679
that just goes to show you heard it on

6559.119 --> 6566.139
the news a boy died of the corona virus

6563.679 --> 6570.159
it's like yeah they said it they just

6566.139 --> 6572.979
said it and you thought ah yeah now I

6570.159 --> 6576.07
can tell all their people that a boy

6572.979 --> 6577.899
died of the corona virus I didn't check

6576.07 --> 6579.999
it though I didn't check if they

6577.899 --> 6582.399
actually died if it is even a real

6579.999 --> 6584.739
person what does he look like

6582.399 --> 6587.26
what's the mark Oh is he in the morgue

6584.739 --> 6589.178999999999
right now what's the report what what

6587.26 --> 6591.459
were exactly the physiological

6589.179 --> 6593.469
conditions of his death what did he do

6591.459 --> 6596.26
before that did he take any vaccines

6593.469 --> 6599.889
when was going on oh no no no no no no

6596.26 --> 6602.34

though how can anything be proven ever

6671.21 --> 6679.17
well by proving it and not just taking

6675.45 --> 6684.08
blank assertions handed to you by a news

6679.17 --> 6688.58

shout at you Joran opt ow what kind of

6720.119 --> 6726.9
question is that how can anything ever

6722.82 --> 6731.21
be proven what if I don't just trust a

6726.9 --> 6739.65
blank assertion by a news reader what

6731.21 --> 6742.05
hello hello it's like is there some kind

6739.65 --> 6746.82
of switch over there just not clicking

6742.05 --> 6749.4890000000005
that you shouldn't take anything just as

6746.82 --> 6755.63
is when it's being told to you

6749.489 --> 6755.629999999999
especially in the news these days hello

6755.84 --> 6763.56

no no if it's on the news it's true I

6763.56 --> 6769.830000000001
must trust that it is correct is that

6766.469 --> 6778.19
really what you're saying I'm not sure

6769.83 --> 6781.05
dude but oh really oh so you do you do

Jorn Abdal is a statist he will

6786.599 --> 6793.32
literally take anything as is apparently

6790.5 --> 6796.02
so because if you start to doubt what

6793.32 --> 6798.23
the newsreader say then apparently you

6796.02 --> 6802.59
can't prove anything anymore

6798.23 --> 6805.73
this really sad to hear that Jordan it's

6802.59 --> 6805.7300000000005

Michelle she's lying to you okay if that

7045.13 --> 7050.83
is the case now hey the hospital may

7047.8 --> 7056.41
just be full there may still be regular

7050.83 --> 7059.65
flu going on or I know depression issues

7056.41 --> 7061.84
from the the isolation now all of a

7059.65 --> 7064.57
sudden being a force the police state

7061.84 --> 7067.06
fairs [ __ ] yeah there may be people

7064.57 --> 7069.759999999999
going to hospitals because they get a

7067.06 --> 7073.6900000000005
heart attack from the stress or lose

7069.76 --> 7076.06
their business you know it may get an

7073.69 --> 7078.969999999999
accident yeah that may happen that there

7076.06 --> 7083.02
may the hospitals will have people in

7078.97 --> 7085.66
them sure but Corona Corona all these

7083.02 --> 7088.570000000001
full corona patient hospital where where

7085.66 --> 7094.18
are they I have not seen a single

7088.57 --> 7097.03
picture that was not fed to us by news

7094.18 --> 7100.27
outlets that are well if you look

7097.03 --> 7103.8099999999995
closely seem to be crisis actors it's

7100.27 --> 7107.2300000000005
not real or it's not what they say it is

7103.81 --> 7107.92
it's not Corona those people don't have

7107.23 --> 7111.58
Corona

7107.92 --> 7114.85
there is no Corona it doesn't exist

7111.58 --> 7120.15
this thing that is supposedly a threat

7114.85 --> 7120.150000000001
it does not exist it's virtual

7120.51 --> 7128.889
there is corona type virus elements that

7125.739 --> 7131.619
exist and they arrive during flu season

7128.889 --> 7134.9800000000005
and maybe even also allergy season

7131.619 --> 7137.848999999999
depending on the region yeah it exists

7134.98 --> 7141.999
it's a part of our natural mechanisms

7137.849 --> 7146.4400000000005
this this infectious corona virus

7141.999 --> 7148.989
disease spreading it doesn't exist there

7146.44 --> 7150.638999999999
is nothing there doesn't mean that there

7148.989 --> 7152.919999999999
will always be nothing there who knows

7150.639 --> 7154.719
what the hell they're making what else

7152.92 --> 7156.579
they're gonna freakin unleash whatever

7154.719 --> 7157.329
they got planned but what is happening

7156.579 --> 7162.13
right now

7157.329 --> 7165.308999999999
is nothing there is no virus spreading

7162.13 --> 7179.289
it's all lies all of it

7165.309 --> 7181.809
all of it is lies but hey they could

7179.289 --> 7184.389
they could just freakin send out poison

7181.809 --> 7187.6900000000005
now they could just say oh you know what

7184.389 --> 7190.179
the fear the just the fear spell it's

7187.69 --> 7194.469
not working good enough let's just

7190.179 --> 7196.63
freakin really send that [ __ ] out let's

7194.469 --> 7198.849
just take a couple of boys with a really

7196.63 --> 7202.119
fucked-up disease this is really

7198.849 --> 7205.4800000000005
maniacal and send them out and and

7202.119 --> 7207.308999999999
suddenly people really do get terrible

7205.48 --> 7209.23
diseases or whatever who knows maybe

7207.309 --> 7212.999
they literally gonna spread the freakin

7209.23 --> 7217.329
plague I don't know probably not

7212.999 --> 7219.579
probably not at this point but they

7217.329 --> 7221.909
could and then and then they'd love to

7219.579 --> 7225.219
you look the problem is is everybody

7221.909 --> 7227.17
everybody that's gonna point out Coronas

7225.219 --> 7228.849
fake it's not real there is no disease

7227.17 --> 7232.03
there's nothing going on there hospitals

7228.849 --> 7234.6990000000005
are empty they don't like that that

7232.03 --> 7236.768999999999
we're just pointing at the lie straight

7234.699 --> 7238.329
to their faces they don't like that and

7236.769 --> 7241.059
the more people they do it the less they

7238.329 --> 7243.369
like it so they may then just create it

7241.059 --> 7245.679
make it real all of a sudden and

7243.369 --> 7249.61
suddenly the [ __ ] hits the fan it's like

7245.679 --> 7252.339
all those people called it fake arrest

7249.61 --> 7255.6089999999995
them they call it free

7252.339 --> 7257.8
arrest them see see all the footage of

7255.609 --> 7260.7390000000005
all the people actually dying in their

7257.8 --> 7262.78
own drool yeah it was always there I

7260.739 --> 7265.268999999999
know you nobody's seen it for like a

7262.78 --> 7267.759999999999

arrest the corona deniers hmm they'll

7272.709 --> 7281.82
try anything anything if they can't get

7278.619 --> 7285.999
their neo feudalism world government

7281.82 --> 7288.728999999999
stage to happen I think if they can get

7285.999 --> 7292.019
it done if they will do this [ __ ] they

7288.729 --> 7292.019
will do whatever they can

7296.729 --> 7299.729
yeah

7302.45 --> 7307.6089999999995
[Music]

7311.679 --> 7325.52
all right whoo I've been going for two

7314.96 --> 7330.32
hours I don't know man

7325.52 --> 7333.56
dank look this this weird freaky amoral

7330.32 --> 7336.23
satanic spirit and like the holes that

7333.56 --> 7338.110000000001
this monster system unfolding this world

7336.23 --> 7341.389999999999
government run by pretty much

7338.11 --> 7344.799999999999
Psychopaths with artificially created

7341.39 --> 7350.06
Psychopaths as puppets under them right

7344.8 --> 7353.81
these freaks they will push as far as

7350.06 --> 7357.110000000001
they can and yeah if they gain more

7353.81 --> 7360.02
ground they can normalize demonic

7357.11 --> 7362.8099999999995
behavior Eve behavior and put extreme

7360.02 --> 7365.42
politicization like extreme political

7362.81 --> 7368.0
punishment they could just nor a start

7365.42 --> 7371.57
to normalize that and then yeah they

7368.0 --> 7374.21
will just say yeah we got a group they

7371.57 --> 7378.23
have been the problem they've they've

7374.21 --> 7381.53
gone against our progress yeah okay

7378.23 --> 7385.009999999999
everybody now yeah go out find these

7381.53 --> 7389.09
people and yeah beat him up or something

7385.01 --> 7392.4800000000005
yeah well beef I've seen that kind of

7389.09 --> 7396.7390000000005
thing already happening in America that

7392.48 --> 7399.199
[ __ ] happens people get on social media

7396.739 --> 7402.0199999999995

7399.199 --> 7404.9
these people and they're not taken down

7402.02 --> 7407.92
they're not taken down nobody's taking

7404.9 --> 7410.509999999999
it down blatant calls for violence

7407.92 --> 7413.56
literal descriptive violence with

7410.51 --> 7419.38
specific targets and it's not taken down

7413.56 --> 7422.660000000001
okay anybody take notice of that huh

7419.38 --> 7425.36
think it's just gonna be that think that

7422.66 --> 7428.75
couldn't spread further become even more

7425.36 --> 7433.429
maniacal and normalized and weaponized

7428.75 --> 7438.55
by the psychopathic world government

7433.429 --> 7441.59
oh yeah no things can always grow worse

7438.55 --> 7446.6900000000005
they can they can always grow there is

7441.59 --> 7450.59
no level at which it stops okay people

7446.69 --> 7454.879999999999
there is no level at which it stops it

7450.59 --> 7456.9490000000005
can always go deeper forever until

7454.88 --> 7460.58
literally people burst

7456.949 --> 7463.25
apart from stress until literally their

7460.58 --> 7465.429
their bodies just falter and break under

7463.25 --> 7468.98
the stress of the insanity of it all

7465.429 --> 7474.409
they will go everywhere everywhere you

7468.98 --> 7480.62
can imagine if you let them if you let

7474.409 --> 7483.379999999999
them they will go into the abyss and

7480.62 --> 7487.67
drag everything with them if you let

7483.38 --> 7490.219
them and they will drag you with their -

7487.67 --> 7493.31
even if you think you are resisting by

7490.219 --> 7497.51
staying passive eventually you will be

7493.31 --> 7499.6900000000005
