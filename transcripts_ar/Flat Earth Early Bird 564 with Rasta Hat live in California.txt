rather premiered one last night right

95.47 --> 99.85
before going to bed I just put it on and

97.72 --> 102.42999999999999
I did I went to bed I didn't even watch

99.85 --> 105.55
it life and thus afterward figured out

102.43 --> 107.14
that it wasn't set to Members Only even

105.55 --> 109.6
though I remember setting it to members

107.14 --> 111.28
only so it was a bit annoyed by that but

109.6 --> 114.28
I guess that other people got to see it

111.28 --> 117.009
as well now I have said it to members

114.28 --> 120.58
only though so if you got to see it

117.009 --> 124.78
while not being member you were lucky if

120.58 --> 127.03
you want to see it anyway then become a

124.78 --> 128.95
member of my channel it's not that

127.03 --> 132.64000000000001
expensive and yeah you'll get to see the

128.95 --> 138.16
videos so I hope you enjoyed it right

132.64 --> 142.14999999999998
Steve you did good but it was supposed

138.16 --> 145.12
to be Members Only but anyway yeah I

142.15 --> 149.08
thought it it was it was a pretty long

145.12 --> 152.5
day overall with the ball busters there

149.08 --> 154.51000000000002

157.48 --> 163.26899999999998

169.51 --> 177.34

201.94 --> 206.65
way it looks but it is kind of warm

203.89 --> 214.14999999999998

as Wednesday so yeah Rasta called me up

302.58 --> 309.53999999999996
and yeah in the middle of the night for

306.24 --> 311.7
him basically but that's a weird

309.54 --> 313.44
situation going on like when he was away

311.7 --> 317.34
from home apparently there was this

313.44 --> 319.52
shooting going on and I think it's even

317.34 --> 322.85999999999996
like on the news over there or something

319.52 --> 324.59999999999997
but yeah he and desi are like right

322.86 --> 327.08000000000004
around the corner from where it's

324.6 --> 327.08000000000004
happening

327.47 --> 335.36
so we kind of got live reporters on the

329.91 --> 335.36
ground crazy situation

344.5 --> 349.25
like is it so many times when Rasta

347.78 --> 354.15999999999997
calls me up that's just something crazy

349.25 --> 357.95
happening right there on the spot

354.16 --> 362.68
not in the news tracking it through

357.95 --> 362.68
private social media okay okay

374.74 --> 380.12
right so anyway yeah over there it's

377.51 --> 381.98
it's pretty black it's a black night and

380.12 --> 385.79
there's a darkened helicopter flying

381.98 --> 387.92
over over that plate yeah over the area

385.79 --> 393.11
constantly for yeah what is it

387.92 --> 395.6
has been doing that for a while from

393.11 --> 398.27000000000004
what I've understood they haven't caught

395.6 --> 405.08000000000004
the supposed perpetrator or a shooter

398.27 --> 414.03999999999996
yet so yeah that's going on right there

405.08 --> 414.03999999999996
in arrest us neighborhoods mm-hmm anyway

415.3 --> 425.3
yeah I yeah as I said before I went to

420.11 --> 430.61
bed really early was it I think it was

425.3 --> 432.29
even before 12:00 at night and yeah used

430.61 --> 439.91
a lot of that time in the morning to

432.29 --> 442.58000000000004
sleep just try to recover I don't know

439.91 --> 445.37
more sleep seems to be very useful when

442.58 --> 448.15999999999997
I feel the way that I do as I have been

445.37 --> 451.49
in the last week I had a lot of dreams

448.16 --> 459.29
too and my dreams are getting more

451.49 --> 463.57
interesting my dreams are almost like

459.29 --> 467.54
getting back into like some of the more

463.57 --> 470.81
creative dark world vision parts where I

467.54 --> 472.78000000000003
see like a a three-dimensional

470.81 --> 475.31
representation of something that's not

472.78 --> 478.96999999999997
three-dimensional it's like more a point

475.31 --> 481.82
situation yeah it's complex it's very

478.97 --> 484.91
it's dreamy when that happens but I have

481.82 --> 486.95
a lot of it recently and it is very

484.91 --> 491.08000000000004
interesting because I get the idea I am

486.95 --> 494.63
in contact with with regular people that

491.08 --> 496.46
I've never met it's like almost like I'm

494.63 --> 498.90999999999997
getting introduced with people that I'm

496.46 --> 501.90999999999997
going to meet in the future in some

498.91 --> 504.28000000000003
it's I can't explain it under any other

501.91 --> 506.65000000000003
way but this does seem to happen because

504.28 --> 508.78
I do just meet people and talk to people

506.65 --> 512.9499999999999
that have never seen before

508.78 --> 517.2099999999999
in my dreams but it does seem to involve

512.95 --> 518.6800000000001
like something of my life so it's it's

517.21 --> 522.21
kind of a mystery to me when that

518.68 --> 526.9599999999999
happens it is very fascinating getting

522.21 --> 529.0
yeah more grip off on my dreams by the

526.96 --> 531.1
way despite me still kind of like

529.0 --> 534.31
smoking cannabis and drinking alcohol

531.1 --> 542.49
and they're not nightmarish by the way -

534.31 --> 542.4899999999999
not at all so right so that's happening

542.58 --> 548.23
oh and Benjamin Thomas of course

546.49 --> 553.24
happening again yesterday and was

548.23 --> 555.9300000000001
awesome it's really just awesome to be

553.24 --> 555.9300000000001
in that chat

559.23 --> 565.04
but yeah beside that I've just been very

562.26 --> 568.14
active on the Flat Earth debate and the

565.04 --> 570.51
ballbuster show and then afterward my

568.14 --> 574.14
own little recording which was a by the

570.51 --> 577.2
way already going for an hour before I

574.14 --> 581.55
even started like okay I'm going to

577.2 --> 584.19
record this because sometimes I have to

581.55 --> 586.89
like gather momentum and realization

584.19 --> 588.45
like yeah I should record this because

586.89 --> 590.4
they're always talking they're like

588.45 --> 598.85
always blah blah lined with chai key of

590.4 --> 608.81
course you know it never stops what

598.85 --> 608.8100000000001
okie-dokie Missouri bear holy [ __ ] okay

609.74 --> 617.46
well I was I got through what is it the

613.2 --> 620.07
brilliant middle school call it stoned a

617.46 --> 622.2900000000001
lot of the time as well not always don't

620.07 --> 624.21
think it wasn't during my exam or

622.29 --> 627.98
anything oh I don't know I don't

624.21 --> 630.8100000000001
remember I might have been a little I

627.98 --> 634.38
think that day like it I did like a

630.81 --> 636.7199999999999
smoke in the morning or something but

634.38 --> 640.92
but no wait I'm pretty sure I didn't

636.72 --> 644.94
because I was nervous [ __ ] but it worked

640.92 --> 650.9599999999999
out great I was pretty satisfied with my

644.94 --> 650.96
test results back in the day did in 1999

652.01 --> 659.25
but that whole period I was just smoking

654.78 --> 663.3
cannabis a lot daily like even during

659.25 --> 667.22
school outside of school by the way

663.3 --> 670.2199999999999
which was not allowed I was like yeah

667.22 --> 670.22
whatever

671.24 --> 679.07
don't recommend doing that by the way

673.16 --> 686.899
just being stubborn and a for me it was

679.07 --> 690.1600000000001
like social exploration so every morning

686.899 --> 690.16
before school to him

698.73 --> 701.3290000000001
all right

711.55 --> 718.0899999999999
yeah now I never did that is it nothing

715.12 --> 720.75
that could ever work with a needle you

718.09 --> 720.75
know ever

729.07 --> 739.09
ah alright see you did it a show with

736.29 --> 742.99
creation very good surfing good to hear

739.09 --> 747.3000000000001
you're certainly busy on a daily basis

742.99 --> 747.3
these days a lot of shows from you

751.5 --> 754.679
[Music]

756.99 --> 760.3
ish

758.14 --> 763.12
[Music]

760.3 --> 768.5799999999999
right I'm just very glad I never went

763.12 --> 771.16
there you know I I I was kind of like on

768.58 --> 773.38
the edge of trying some things at some

771.16 --> 776.1999999999999
point but like things like heroin or

773.38 --> 779.08
like pill based pharmaceuticals that

776.2 --> 781.6
things like ecstasy were never among

779.08 --> 784.0200000000001
them because I was just too aware of

781.6 --> 788.82
what it would do and I'm already

784.02 --> 791.17
naturally so like sensitive and

788.82 --> 793.87
overwhelmed by feeling so if I would

791.17 --> 797.38
just stretch all that up through that

793.87 --> 800.35
those more extreme drugs like I would

797.38 --> 804.81
have ended up with an even worse yeah

800.35 --> 804.8100000000001
character to deal with myself

806.38 --> 809.539
[Music]

829.31 --> 834.9899999999999
yeah Missouri B right I get it

832.56 --> 840.4499999999999
I don't really want to talk about that

834.99 --> 843.38
though everybody's had their own trials

840.45 --> 843.38
in their life Oh

859.92 --> 870.7299999999999
well you know in my family like me and

867.879 --> 873.0690000000001
my mother were kind of like a bit of the

870.73 --> 875.86
more drug user types but my mother had

873.069 --> 881.139
had similar issues it's very similar

875.86 --> 883.48
build so yeah she would G almost like

881.139 --> 885.16
accidentally almost killed herself a

883.48 --> 886.899
couple of times because of drinking

885.16 --> 892.569
because it made too much impact like

886.899 --> 896.079
that she went into delirium so yeah she

892.569 --> 897.43
never really went over the edge on

896.079 --> 900.93
anything either

897.43 --> 907.449
like prolonged addiction

900.93 --> 911.079
besides cannabis use that's it so yeah

907.449 --> 913.649
and unfortunately though as time went on

911.079 --> 916.8389999999999
she started to take more pharmaceuticals

913.649 --> 921.339
because she did have problems and she

916.839 --> 923.23
just couldn't handle it by yourself like

921.339 --> 927.3090000000001
things starting out with allergies its

923.23 --> 929.0790000000001
typical problems that I even have and I

927.309 --> 931.12
can imagine that for my mother

929.079 --> 933.7589999999999
it must have been very tough to just

931.12 --> 936.149
accept like yeah that's how it's gonna

933.759 --> 938.17
be and if you're gonna take some

936.149 --> 940.689
pharmaceutical it's only gonna make

938.17 --> 942.639
things worse over that over time it's

940.689 --> 944.139
just gonna erode your organs that are

942.639 --> 954.029
causing the problems in the first place

944.139 --> 959.25
more over time and it did whatever

954.029 --> 961.66
alright but I never I never went there

959.25 --> 963.25
tried to figure it out through other

961.66 --> 965.319
mechanisms through other

963.25 --> 968.519
supplementation's things like iodine

965.319 --> 968.519
have helped me a lot

978.48 --> 993.1990000000001
anyway any updates on the situation

981.989 --> 1005.749
their arrest I had a Dan Winfield

993.199 --> 1006.439
longtime right over what I was trying to

1005.749 --> 1008.419
make a point

1006.439 --> 1010.8689999999999
but like yeah me and my mother were like

1008.419 --> 1013.279
the only ones really getting into that

1010.869 --> 1014.119
still fluid in the helicopters though

1013.279 --> 1016.429
alright

1014.119 --> 1018.4390000000001
they're still looking well the guy

1016.429 --> 1023.389
whoever it is is probably hiding

1018.439 --> 1026.949
somewhere that could take a while yet

1023.389 --> 1031.1
you just heard iodine that's correct

1026.949 --> 1035.5790000000002
all right on was a big step in my self

1031.1 --> 1038.6789999999999
repair through supplementation

1035.579 --> 1038.6789999999999
[Music]

1041.87 --> 1047.7199999999998
anyway but yeah considering the drug

1045.86 --> 1050.299
usage me and my mother were really only

1047.72 --> 1055.1000000000001
ones that even kind of were open to

1050.299 --> 1057.5
trying stuff to some degree my dad a lil

1055.1 --> 1059.98
but it was even more attractive more

1057.5 --> 1063.59
modest with it like he never really

1059.98 --> 1066.95
tried anything I think except just for

1063.59 --> 1070.4189999999999
alcohol and cannabis and such I'm not

1066.95 --> 1074.45
too sure though I should ask him again I

1070.419 --> 1076.97
know that just after I kind of gotten

1074.45 --> 1079.25
into smoking at least he didn't do

1076.97 --> 1082.94
anything I think he might have tried

1079.25 --> 1085.01
some things back in the day during the

1082.94 --> 1086.72
worst and Woodstock era and all that

1085.01 --> 1088.07
that wouldn't be surprising a lot of

1086.72 --> 1091.82
people would just take like

1088.07 --> 1093.83
hallucination based drugs and [ __ ] but

1091.82 --> 1095.84
I'd have to ask him again but anyway

1093.83 --> 1097.8799999999999
yeah the rest of the family was really

1095.84 --> 1100.9399999999998
looking down at that and kind of at my

1097.88 --> 1105.0800000000002
mother and me with that it's like yeah

1100.94 --> 1107.0
drug users is stupid but yeah my mother

1105.08 --> 1109.48
sort of had it under control because she

1107.0 --> 1113.45
still had a prestigious job sort of an

1109.48 --> 1116.809
responsibility and I however did not so

1113.45 --> 1121.159
yeah that didn't really help my social

1116.809 --> 1124.1789999999999
position in my family so I kind of

1121.159 --> 1124.179
became the black sheep

1124.33 --> 1129.799
didn't really want that to be but it

1127.19 --> 1136.3700000000001
that's just what happened and I got used

1129.799 --> 1141.11
to that but I never used it as an excuse

1136.37 --> 1143.84
to just completely let myself go like

1141.11 --> 1149.0
give up no I was really trying to find a

1143.84 --> 1149.98
new way a new angle to do it all not go

1149.0 --> 1155.63
along to get along

1149.98 --> 1160.8990000000001
but not rejecting it and then become

1155.63 --> 1163.909
like a bottom-feeder scumbag either and

1160.899 --> 1168.1589999999999
not stuck in the middle so I was really

1163.909 --> 1171.73
like yeah like how can I break with this

1168.159 --> 1175.2
thing going on in the world around me

1171.73 --> 1181.479
what's trying to force me into it

1175.2 --> 1184.21
without ya losing the things that I have

1181.479 --> 1186.729
that are the reason that I'm rebelling

1184.21 --> 1189.429
against it in the first place if I just

1186.729 --> 1191.429
lose all the qualities that were the

1189.429 --> 1194.979
reason for me to rebel

1191.429 --> 1197.279
then it was all wasted and I kind of

1194.979 --> 1200.499
knew that ahead of times like I had to

1197.279 --> 1203.919
do it right

1200.499 --> 1208.749
in a more complex way more personal way

1203.919 --> 1212.3690000000001
and I think I kind of have succeeded at

1208.749 --> 1215.3790000000001
it although it feels very chaotic and

1212.369 --> 1216.849
yeah the functionality you know I have a

1215.379 --> 1221.32
lot of doubts about me and what I'm

1216.849 --> 1223.629
doing but yeah that's what happens when

1221.32 --> 1226.21
you kind of like try to create something

1223.629 --> 1228.9399999999998
completely new in a way something that

1226.21 --> 1231.429
that is actually a controversial way of

1228.94 --> 1234.239
doing things you can't really pin it

1231.429 --> 1234.239
down so easily

1239.63 --> 1246.21
all right but it is you know when you're

1243.0 --> 1248.55
actually taking an action to defend

1246.21 --> 1250.95
something that you perceive is being

1248.55 --> 1253.47
eroded or attacked or you're they're

1250.95 --> 1256.74
trying to force you to abandon it or in

1253.47 --> 1264.27
your rebellion if you are going to end

1256.74 --> 1267.72
up losing it anyway then is that a

1264.27 --> 1269.97
proper route to take do you see

1267.72 --> 1272.21
doesn't mean that that there's no choice

1269.97 --> 1275.7
like you're going to have to go along

1272.21 --> 1278.07
it's just that you have to make sure

1275.7 --> 1281.46
that if you're going to reject it you're

1278.07 --> 1284.01
not going to end up just throwing it

1281.46 --> 1286.71
away anyway because you didn't see any

1284.01 --> 1289.65
other way all right you didn't realize

1286.71 --> 1293.97
what you were doing and what the

1289.65 --> 1297.51
consequences would be right but that's

1293.97 --> 1300.6000000000001
that's extremely complicated for most

1297.51 --> 1306.81
people they don't even realize it when

1300.6 --> 1309.75
it's happening you know often in tough

1306.81 --> 1312.8999999999999
positions when you are forced to kind of

1309.75 --> 1315.66
make a choice you choose very polarized

1312.9 --> 1318.96
and just stick to one or the other and

1315.66 --> 1320.94
you lose oversight because you feel like

1318.96 --> 1325.92
you're being forced to make a polarized

1320.94 --> 1327.15
yes or no basic choice that's what

1325.92 --> 1332.5500000000002
happens to most people it's what the

1327.15 --> 1336.77
stress of being forced does hmm yes

1363.82 --> 1366.82
cool

1382.97 --> 1390.34
everyone is going to live in their minds

1385.519 --> 1390.34
I'm going to enjoy the ride huh well

1390.429 --> 1396.2
while me enjoying the ride is not going

1393.799 --> 1398.119
to be conditional based on what anyone's

1396.2 --> 1400.249
gonna do I'm just gonna try to enjoy the

1398.119 --> 1403.849
ride it's going to be difficult enough

1400.249 --> 1409.82
by itself even if I just blatantly

1403.849 --> 1412.479
choose to do that I have no choice if I

1409.82 --> 1421.7
don't enjoy the ride it's gonna yeah

1412.479 --> 1424.999
finish me off does he enjoy as an

1421.7 --> 1428.979
essential resource that I cannot afford

1424.999 --> 1428.979
to squander for myself

1437.49 --> 1450.27
Moon Man was timed out yeah he was just

1447.64 --> 1450.2700000000002
being annoying

1461.34 --> 1464.86
hello stallion 8012 yeah doing great

1464.32 --> 1469.1499999999999
today

1464.86 --> 1471.4499999999998
I think they drove a car in the moon yes

1469.15 --> 1471.45
they do

1486.94 --> 1497.659
how's the soap opera which one oh right

1495.769 --> 1503.21
next door but it's been very quiet

1497.659 --> 1504.8600000000001
actually I think I hurt the [ __ ] it

1503.21 --> 1509.1490000000001
feels so bad I shouldn't it's like none

1504.86 --> 1512.84
of my business really but yeah it's

1509.149 --> 1514.7589999999998
calmed down I think the girls did kind

1512.84 --> 1517.519
of like had a bit of a crying moment

1514.759 --> 1520.85
again at some point but not really too

1517.519 --> 1526.97
long or loud and I don't know they're

1520.85 --> 1529.129
just still going I think from what my

1526.97 --> 1530.779
feelings can kind of size up of the

1529.129 --> 1532.61
situation they're probably just gonna

1530.779 --> 1533.929
keep on hanging around until the end of

1532.61 --> 1536.119
summer and then they're probably gonna

1533.929 --> 1540.0800000000002
not see each other anymore after that

1536.119 --> 1542.259
point if my census sized things up

1540.08 --> 1542.259
correctly

1548.42 --> 1554.8400000000001
all right oh there's more issues though

1551.36 --> 1558.29
you know I I'm gonna have I got old man

1554.84 --> 1560.57
complaints just like my mother had old

1558.29 --> 1564.49
lady complaints because we got loud

1560.57 --> 1567.6799999999998
neighbors it's like the door or the

1564.49 --> 1569.18
apartment right next to here there's

1567.68 --> 1571.49
like students in there

1569.18 --> 1573.89
they're always are just like here by the

1571.49 --> 1577.31
way so students but yeah some of these

1573.89 --> 1579.5600000000002
are like French foreign students and

1577.31 --> 1583.49
they're always sitting on the balcony

1579.56 --> 1585.98
being like really freaking loud and even

1583.49 --> 1589.4
having music out loud and it's [ __ ]

1585.98 --> 1591.59
annoying and they do it until too late

1589.4 --> 1593.99
like it until twelve o'clock you

1591.59 --> 1596.06
shouldn't do that but it's like yeah if

1593.99 --> 1597.71
I'm gonna go over there and complain

1596.06 --> 1599.81
about it they're not gonna change it I'm

1597.71 --> 1607.55
pretty damn sure because they're French

1599.81 --> 1609.77
I usually don't past experiences but

1607.55 --> 1611.4199999999998
yeah if they're I don't know maybe I

1609.77 --> 1615.41
will complain about at some point if

1611.42 --> 1618.53
they push if they push it too far but

1615.41 --> 1620.99
there's a lot of noise outside here it's

1618.53 --> 1623.06
just it's like people treat their

1620.99 --> 1625.6
balcony sometimes like it's a restaurant

1623.06 --> 1625.6
or something

1632.78 --> 1639.96
yeah and Robin Stanley and not just that

1636.33 --> 1644.1299999999999
they're just like baseline French

1639.96 --> 1646.77
liberal people too so like even the way

1644.13 --> 1651.9
they make jokes and [ __ ] is just really

1646.77 --> 1655.5
[ __ ] embarrassing and it's it's just

1651.9 --> 1657.45
extremely typical it's not like they're

1655.5 --> 1665.43
really cool French people or something

1657.45 --> 1671.82
they're just typical like news and like

1665.43 --> 1674.03
movie TV program parroting yeah basic

1671.82 --> 1674.03
people

1683.92 --> 1688.17
I don't know man maybe I'm just being

1688.23 --> 1694.15
easily agitated maybe if I was actually

1692.53 --> 1697.27
able to talk French it could have

1694.15 --> 1701.5600000000002
probably turned out to be pretty

1697.27 --> 1703.3899999999999
interesting because I do know that with

1701.56 --> 1706.6
French in general if you can't speak

1703.39 --> 1709.0300000000002
French they really kind of like okay

1706.6 --> 1711.3999999999999
that's awesome then we're kind of will

1709.03 --> 1715.36
treat you like a friend that's what I

1711.4 --> 1717.88
have noticed from the past because my my

1715.36 --> 1719.56
parents could speak French and they

1717.88 --> 1724.5700000000002
tried that out with some French people

1719.56 --> 1730.6299999999999
and yeah that kind of did work yeah

1724.57 --> 1736.05
Spanish did they do it - that's right an

1730.63 --> 1736.0500000000002
Italians in Greece people from Greece

1740.7 --> 1745.529
but it's based in their in their

1743.549 --> 1748.499
cultural habits too you know it's just

1745.529 --> 1750.6
typical just oh it's usually warm

1748.499 --> 1752.309
outside so you just go and sit outside

1750.6 --> 1757.82
and just don't give a [ __ ] about

1752.309 --> 1760.109
anything and just be loud and enjoy and

1757.82 --> 1763.109
the worst that's going to happen is that

1760.109 --> 1765.09
people are gonna approach you and maybe

1763.109 --> 1766.9499999999998
tell you to please be a little bit less

1765.09 --> 1769.4399999999998
noisy but you could take that

1766.95 --> 1773.0900000000001
opportunity to contact them it's almost

1769.44 --> 1773.0900000000001
like this kind of built-in system

1784.12 --> 1794.6999999999998
Wow yeah now that's yeah and Akbar

1789.45 --> 1794.7
yeah you're gonna go to yeah goodbye

1809.95 --> 1820.7
yeah and you're gonna go to because

1814.609 --> 1822.769
you're the same person so any more

1820.7 --> 1828.519
spontaneous socks you want to create and

1822.769 --> 1828.519
have removed because I know it's you

1841.23 --> 1847.359
no good

1844.28 --> 1847.359
[Music]

1856.17 --> 1861.93
I don't know who it is I just know it's

1858.81 --> 1864.96
that same person that's trying to shame

1861.93 --> 1868.73
bears and I know that so it's probably

1864.96 --> 1868.73
somebody that really hates on Benjamin

1872.36 --> 1879.87
there's plenty of candidates for that I

1876.32 --> 1882.9299999999998
just know that those accounts that just

1879.87 --> 1886.77
just manifest just to say hello right

1882.93 --> 1889.44
there right then are absolutely the same

1886.77 --> 1893.93
person that is being banned see there's

1889.44 --> 1893.93
no there's no way it's not

1903.92 --> 1913.6100000000001
a Rob Kane ah yeah I left your comment

1911.48 --> 1916.16
in the comment section of the video last

1913.61 --> 1920.3
last night because you are an actual

1916.16 --> 1925.9
member and you were supposed to be able

1920.3 --> 1928.19
to see it thanks for being a member I

1925.9 --> 1929.75
hope you enjoyed the video I thought it

1928.19 --> 1931.97
was pretty good I watched it back before

1929.75 --> 1933.17
the show before a Rasta called me up and

1931.97 --> 1942.34
it was pretty good

1933.17 --> 1942.3400000000001
I liked how I was so calm more sirens

1944.56 --> 1952.48
you want to call in through Skype for a

1947.54 --> 1956.2
moment and share some of that Resta top

1952.48 --> 1956.2
just optional you know

1967.89 --> 1974.7
must admire his persistence who whose

1972.059 --> 1977.34
persistence I was talking to like three

1974.7 --> 1979.98
people or rather they were all talking

1977.34 --> 1983.6899999999998
to me okay

1979.98 --> 1983.69
I'll call you up I guess

1994.01 --> 2006.58
right now guns have nephron I think that

1997.22 --> 2008.29
the foremost reason what I talking all

2006.58 --> 2018.6399999999999
through each other right

2008.29 --> 2021.34
I think the form for most reason why own

2018.64 --> 2026.0700000000002
Benjamin gets so much hatred is because

2021.34 --> 2028.559
of the sacred slaughterhouse situation

2026.07 --> 2033.1299999999999
because there's just a lot of people

2028.559 --> 2036.28
that will hold on to that some of the

2033.13 --> 2038.1100000000001
things he said are just unacceptable and

2036.28 --> 2040.27
they'll hold on to it forever they'll

2038.11 --> 2042.34
keep it a secret that that is the thing

2040.27 --> 2043.78
that they're holding on to forever they

2042.34 --> 2046.1499999999999
probably won't even mention no they'll

2043.78 --> 2049.81
just use that the back of their hearts

2046.15 --> 2051.909
as a reason to try to slander and attack

2049.81 --> 2054.85
anything Owen Benjamin related which is

2051.909 --> 2059.649
kind of easy because of his comedy

2054.85 --> 2061.99
strategy just the the word use and it's

2059.649 --> 2067.0299999999997
meant to draw attention it's madan meant

2061.99 --> 2070.6589999999997
to ridicule the debates nature the basic

2067.03 --> 2073.09
nature of humanity as a whole and yeah

2070.659 --> 2075.909
people that are gonna hate on him

2073.09 --> 2077.59
because he slaughtered a certain type of

2075.909 --> 2080.2000000000003
cow that they find absolutely

2077.59 --> 2083.53
unacceptable no matter what yet they are

2080.2 --> 2087.8199999999997
going to get in here get in everywhere

2083.53 --> 2089.2000000000003
and just and just hate I think that's

2087.82 --> 2092.44
the real reason it's because of the

2089.2 --> 2094.3889999999997
sacred slaughterhouse situation like if

2092.44 --> 2096.85
you can't accept something that he's

2094.389 --> 2099.94
tackled if you really can't if it like

2096.85 --> 2102.31
really rolled on to the wrong spot and

2099.94 --> 2104.73
you can't move it away yeah that's what

2102.31 --> 2108.7
you're probably going to end up doing

2104.73 --> 2113.34
and that could be small hats

2108.7 --> 2117.2799999999997
it could be Pike thieves

2113.34 --> 2121.27
some of them you know not the good ones

2117.28 --> 2124.51
and yeah all over the place like what

2121.27 --> 2125.38
category out there and love women women

2124.51 --> 2127.55
okay

2125.38 --> 2129.23
he's very roll through

2127.55 --> 2131.51
additional list well that's gonna erupt

2129.23 --> 2135.11
like half the western women in the wrong

2131.51 --> 2137.0600000000004
way these days so yeah so many people

2135.11 --> 2139.46
that have so many reasons that if they

2137.06 --> 2141.89
can't handle that sacred cow being

2139.46 --> 2146.32
slaughtered by him they're just gonna do

2141.89 --> 2146.3199999999997
that it's meant to be

2151.3 --> 2157.42
oh yeah move not to forget gay people

2154.03 --> 2161.86
know just like everything everything is

2157.42 --> 2164.2000000000003
this every group out there if if yeah

2161.86 --> 2167.38
their subject is being tackled and they

2164.2 --> 2170.95
can't handle it yeah they are gonna end

2167.38 --> 2173.4700000000003
up just hating because their sacred

2170.95 --> 2175.66
thing not because there's something

2173.47 --> 2179.4399999999996
about Owen that they really don't like

2175.66 --> 2186.6099999999997
no it's because it went too far for them

2179.44 --> 2189.55
to be acceptable to justifying the

2186.61 --> 2198.36
behavior I'm trying to identify the

2189.55 --> 2201.73
behavior well maybe it is justification

2198.36 --> 2204.57
it's just like understanding the reason

2201.73 --> 2204.57
why that's happening

2209.23 --> 2215.13
hmm right Rasta I'll call you up for a

2212.83 --> 2215.13
second

2227.74 --> 2235.4199999999996
[Music]

2233.41 --> 2236.96
[Applause]

2235.42 --> 2244.26
[Music]

2236.96 --> 2248.52
you yeah ah I see it's the day lights

2244.26 --> 2251.28
already there when we last talked it was

2248.52 --> 2255.24
completely dark yeah you could have this

2251.28 --> 2256.77
screen shared me uh like yeah the

2255.24 --> 2261.5099999999998
helicopters like all like right there in

2256.77 --> 2264.6
in frame yeah you had your own screen so

2261.51 --> 2268.1000000000004
it's still going hey is that a moon uh

2264.6 --> 2271.5
yeah that's a creeping the creepy moon

2268.1 --> 2277.17
yeah it's you know illuminated

2271.5 --> 2278.43
completely incorrectly of course so they

2277.17 --> 2281.64
don't know where this guy is the

2278.43 --> 2284.46
helicopter is looping back around they

2281.64 --> 2287.18
thought he was in a vehicle that blew

2284.46 --> 2289.53
through a roadblock just a block over

2287.18 --> 2292.5299999999997
right back where I was at fill in those

2289.53 --> 2294.6000000000004
water bottles and and then they managed

2292.53 --> 2297.27
to I guess stop that car and a six

2294.6 --> 2298.92
blocks down but then it wasn't even that

2297.27 --> 2301.58
guy it wasn't even who they were looking

2298.92 --> 2305.31
for and stuff it was just another

2301.58 --> 2307.74
deranged [ __ ] person I want to cuss

2305.31 --> 2310.38
on you're not investigated another

2307.74 --> 2313.2299999999996
deranged person you just blew through

2310.38 --> 2316.76
the roadblock was literally drove

2313.23 --> 2320.76
through the dam police barricade what

2316.76 --> 2324.2400000000002
it's just like that just like that here

2320.76 --> 2327.09
we go so that was some of them maybe

2324.24 --> 2329.6099999999997
there was like a an anti-police urgent

2327.09 --> 2332.25
now or it was an anti-police oh that

2329.61 --> 2337.2000000000003
just made a move I think oh yeah or a

2332.25 --> 2339.53
diversion one of the two hmm that's

2337.2 --> 2339.5299999999997
crazy

2340.75 --> 2347.93
yeah by the way how is that whole anti

2343.91 --> 2349.37
police propaganda going around as far as

2347.93 --> 2351.6099999999997
you can notice because I've been hearing

2349.37 --> 2354.5299999999997
that that there's like really serious

2351.61 --> 2356.4500000000003
crazy ideas of like we gotta get rid of

2354.53 --> 2359.51
the all the police departments and not

2356.45 --> 2364.9399999999996
replace them this is all part of it man

2359.51 --> 2370.25
this is all part of it this is all part

2364.94 --> 2378.62
of it it's the same thing it's all the

2370.25 --> 2383.39
same thing just like I don't get it you

2378.62 --> 2385.58
know like why are these police groups

2383.39 --> 2388.7
just going along with it like that what

2385.58 --> 2390.5299999999997
are they gonna do after you know they're

2388.7 --> 2392.27
they're all people with jobs and

2390.53 --> 2394.28
training and [ __ ] and they want to do

2392.27 --> 2396.65
things in their lives so I just don't

2394.28 --> 2400.4300000000003
get it like why are the police kind of

2396.65 --> 2403.79
like playing into the idea of like no

2400.43 --> 2405.71
more police yes yes and Tifa yay no more

2403.79 --> 2409.88
police yeah our chops are gonna be gone

2405.71 --> 2412.82
yay come in I don't get it what's going

2409.88 --> 2417.02
on what are they gonna do at this most

2412.82 --> 2422.96
recent cop killing you know like of the

2417.02 --> 2426.71
of the of the the dark guy all the

2422.96 --> 2429.59
close-up stills of the video show mass

2426.71 --> 2432.44
mass fraud in the scene like the cops

2429.59 --> 2436.48
uniforms the patches and stuff are all

2432.44 --> 2439.46
sewn on there's no they're not real like

2436.48 --> 2441.23
real stuff on their uniforms it's not a

2439.46 --> 2443.09
real badge it's not really wasn't

2441.23 --> 2445.73
thought through it was just stuck on

2443.09 --> 2447.9500000000003
there quickly like that it was sewn on

2445.73 --> 2453.56
right and then like and then the police

2447.95 --> 2457.0699999999997
car the license plate just says police

2453.56 --> 2460.61
and the car the police cars don't match

2457.07 --> 2463.88
any of the police stations or sheriff's

2460.61 --> 2465.83
or state troopers in any of the city

2463.88 --> 2468.1400000000003
that there was that was in the county or

2465.83 --> 2470.72
the state they don't match it when you

2468.14 --> 2472.52
google like it images and video or

2470.72 --> 2473.81
whatever these hot cars that are there

2472.52 --> 2476.89
don't match any

2473.81 --> 2476.89
they don't actually check out

2480.28 --> 2484.55
yeah they don't actually check out they

2482.57 --> 2489.8
they they come that just comes back as

2484.55 --> 2491.42
BS is nothing yeah sorry

2489.8 --> 2493.04
hey you I was gonna call me like in the

2491.42 --> 2494.65
middle of a show you should know better

2493.04 --> 2496.91
than that

2494.65 --> 2498.32
yeah but the floors and stuff they just

2496.91 --> 2499.52
don't check out like none of the scene

2498.32 --> 2499.94
none of the stuff at the scene checks

2499.52 --> 2502.04
out

2499.94 --> 2505.79
it's all when you do close-ups and stuff

2502.04 --> 2508.61
no no no it isn't right and then the the

2505.79 --> 2510.14
little kneeling thing that um that the

2508.61 --> 2513.05
cops are all doing with the people and

2510.14 --> 2516.83
everything it's the same movement the

2513.05 --> 2518.96
same pose that the guy allegedly like

2516.83 --> 2520.73
killed the guy with it's the kneel on

2518.96 --> 2523.82
your on the neck post

2520.73 --> 2528.5
dude that's Israelis military like

2523.82 --> 2530.9
police like yeah yeah yeah yeah I think

2528.5 --> 2534.05
in that one out and now they're like

2530.9 --> 2537.05
they're having them mirror and repeat it

2534.05 --> 2538.73
and keep that imagery going over and

2537.05 --> 2540.6400000000003
over again by having all these people

2538.73 --> 2543.71
and the cops and everything like

2540.64 --> 2546.41
replicating that it's just it's it's

2543.71 --> 2547.94
it's building and you know an archetypal

2546.41 --> 2549.7999999999997
image you know what I'm saying they're

2547.94 --> 2553.61
building some [ __ ] right there

2549.8 --> 2555.9500000000003
they're building a Nikon strawman 9 I

2553.61 --> 2561.38
can and I can it's like they're

2555.95 --> 2563.75
basically enacting an icon for the

2561.38 --> 2566.03
people to get inflamed the over and rage

2563.75 --> 2572.21
and to use as an inspiration to start

2566.03 --> 2576.32
breaking things down I think this is

2572.21 --> 2579.59
crazy but I don't get a wide wide the

2576.32 --> 2581.69
police like why are they even like being

2579.59 --> 2585.11
part of that that's the part that I just

2581.69 --> 2587.78
don't get like a men are they just

2585.11 --> 2590.06
robots act this way a lot man hmm then

2587.78 --> 2591.8300000000004
these people they just they're just

2590.06 --> 2593.69
repeating history man the Nuremberg

2591.83 --> 2595.19
trials explain all this stuff that we

2593.69 --> 2597.14
see now and they're given the same

2595.19 --> 2598.94
excuses the cops are just like aw we're

2597.14 --> 2600.23
just following orders you know we've got

2598.94 --> 2603.79
jobs we're just following orders

2600.23 --> 2605.92
man that doesn't hold up in court man I

2603.79 --> 2609.79
know

2605.92 --> 2611.53
and so uh yeah but the thing is they

2609.79 --> 2615.45
keep they're keeping the courts closed

2611.53 --> 2617.44
over here so like the mass blood of of

2615.45 --> 2619.5699999999997
lawsuits and everything else and

2617.44 --> 2624.76
injunctions and all this stuff can't

2619.57 --> 2628.03
roll out basically with equalized force

2624.76 --> 2629.8300000000004
of opposition because they're just

2628.03 --> 2631.3900000000003
keeping the courts closed and everything

2629.83 --> 2633.8199999999997
so therefore yeah

2631.39 --> 2635.98
bureaucratic obstacle so yeah they're

2633.82 --> 2638.73
not there they've they've removed the

2635.98 --> 2641.5
the the mechanism of legal recourse

2638.73 --> 2643.72
Jesus they've removed the first and

2641.5 --> 2650.86
they're trying to force the second and

2643.72 --> 2654.3399999999997
that's very unfortunate well but how are

2650.86 --> 2658.27
they gonna keep a grip on the situation

2654.34 --> 2659.92
with this the guy they don't want a grip

2658.27 --> 2663.73
on it they want it to get out of control

2659.92 --> 2665.9500000000003
like that's the goal no but look there's

2663.73 --> 2669.1
like the people getting out of control

2665.95 --> 2671.23
right no longer going that's the one no

2669.1 --> 2672.61
no of course but that's one side but at

2671.23 --> 2675.4
the same time it's like the police

2672.61 --> 2680.1400000000003
department the structures of everything

2675.4 --> 2683.53
the control mechanism itself is at risk

2680.14 --> 2685.69
in the process and it's gonna get out

2683.53 --> 2688.96
whereas right not when your goal is to

2685.69 --> 2691.86
have the system as we all know it burn

2688.96 --> 2697.9
to the ground to consolidate under

2691.86 --> 2699.76
federalization Wow they want to

2697.9 --> 2701.17
eliminate all these local municipalities

2699.76 --> 2702.9100000000003
so they can bring in full-fledged

2701.17 --> 2706.21
federal forces they've already got

2702.91 --> 2710.0499999999997
National Guard's state-level military on

2706.21 --> 2713.92
the streets and a ton of places man what

2710.05 --> 2717.4300000000003
that's that's an angle but the thing is

2713.92 --> 2718.84
that's legal [ __ ] Posse Comitatus

2717.43 --> 2724.48
I know but because they're calling it

2718.84 --> 2727.17
state Nash stay but they're not if if

2724.48 --> 2730.27
they were just state it it'd be okay but

2727.17 --> 2732.58
why here like they have like the

2730.27 --> 2734.32
California National Guard the Washington

2732.58 --> 2737.71
National Guard stuff like that

2734.32 --> 2740.6800000000003
they're bringing them out as direct

2737.71 --> 2742.75
militarized as long

2740.68 --> 2745.24
and so but because they're not

2742.75 --> 2746.5
technically federal that they're they're

2745.24 --> 2753.1299999999997
saying that that's their loophole around

2746.5 --> 2756.7
Posse Comitatus I don't know man this as

2753.13 --> 2758.83
soon as you start to even try to explain

2756.7 --> 2761.58
loopholes it's already wrong it's like

2758.83 --> 2764.2
yeah but of course there is no loophole

2761.58 --> 2765.7
well so that's what we'd like to think

2764.2 --> 2767.1699999999996
but you know they're you know just like

2765.7 --> 2768.58
the Constitution says you know no law

2767.17 --> 2771.16
shall be made that infringes

2768.58 --> 2774.25
yeah well that's exactly that's why

2771.16 --> 2775.5099999999998
there is no loophole that's not how they

2774.25 --> 2777.7
see it that's not the game that they're

2775.51 --> 2783.5800000000004
choosing to play by right it's not it's

2777.7 --> 2786.16
not their scientific method like that so

2783.58 --> 2788.23
all this now that it's daylight took

2786.16 --> 2791.29
place just at the end of the alley and

2788.23 --> 2792.79
then one block over whom not even one

2791.29 --> 2795.49
block one half a block because I'm an

2792.79 --> 2798.34
alley in between two streets and it

2795.49 --> 2799.5699999999997
happened on the street that's just on

2798.34 --> 2802.2400000000002
the other side of that like brown

2799.57 --> 2804.4300000000003
building but at the distance of at the

2802.24 --> 2805.47
end of of where you can see down there

2804.43 --> 2808.5699999999997
hmm

2805.47 --> 2811.72
so and then the roadblock was only was

2808.57 --> 2815.17
literally uh right where I crossed the

2811.72 --> 2816.97
road to get the water uh they set up a

2815.17 --> 2820.03
roadblock only about ten minutes after I

2816.97 --> 2821.6499999999996
had like made it back to the house right

2820.03 --> 2827.73
there at that intersection that I just

2821.65 --> 2830.4100000000003
crossed with the water but really crazy

2827.73 --> 2832.6
so it was like you were standing there

2830.41 --> 2838.96
you almost felt like oh [ __ ] there's

2832.6 --> 2846.43
something gonna happen right here I was

2838.96 --> 2848.44
like the tension was so high on the walk

2846.43 --> 2849.97
down there I was telling you I didn't

2848.44 --> 2851.859
know exactly what it was but it was

2849.97 --> 2854.2599999999998
sketchy and I didn't know why exactly

2851.859 --> 2857.08
but the pressure and that was like

2854.26 --> 2860.4100000000003
really high and then moments later a

2857.08 --> 2863.19
Papa Papa I mean what are the what are

2860.41 --> 2863.19
the odds man

2865.44 --> 2872.52
now yeah hey I still see it

2878.45 --> 2885.0789999999997
man stuff yeah it is crazy stuff but to

2882.44 --> 2886.94
be fair I always think that it's crazy

2885.079 --> 2888.44
they realize it afterward but that does

2886.94 --> 2891.589
really happen you know when [ __ ] is

2888.44 --> 2893.42
gonna go down somewhere not necessarily

2891.589 --> 2896.69
a planned thing but if [ __ ] is gonna go

2893.42 --> 2898.82
down then there is gonna be tension it's

2896.69 --> 2902.71
like everything knows it's gonna happen

2898.82 --> 2908.15
and you can feel it too if you're there

2902.71 --> 2910.55
unless you ignore it like the

2908.15 --> 2918.109
electromagnetic like it like the hair of

2910.55 --> 2919.6400000000003
my arms was just like all right well uh

2918.109 --> 2920.72
I'll let you get back to the rest of

2919.64 --> 2922.73
your show dude and I'll hop back in the

2920.72 --> 2923.1499999999996
chats thanks for calling me this is

2922.73 --> 2925.82
crazy

2923.15 --> 2928.7000000000003
and I'm sure definitely uh not quite

2925.82 --> 2931.13
than normal for the early bird show I

2928.7 --> 2935.359
like it it's good I like that you also

2931.13 --> 2937.4
just drew in all the entire thing of the

2935.359 --> 2939.29
situation down there I'm not having

2937.4 --> 2942.38
really elaborate talks but it there's

2939.29 --> 2944.45
just real [ __ ] going down in the US and

2942.38 --> 2947.27
there's always been [ __ ] going down in

2944.45 --> 2949.5789999999997
the u.s. you know for a long time but

2947.27 --> 2953.03
this is just this is just out of control

the people the control of it they're not

3281.33 --> 3286.16
gonna keep it together so that means

that I'll have to do it then that that

3286.16 --> 3288.8199999999997
would be my attitude

3302.839 --> 3307.5389999999998

3325.009 --> 3331.249
whatever is gonna be there and if the

3328.969 --> 3333.2290000000003
situation that Rasta and I were kind of

3331.249 --> 3335.209
in the middle of or he was literally in

3333.229 --> 3338.239
the middle of it I was just a witness

3335.209 --> 3341.1789999999996

completely fake then I'll keep you

3348.799 --> 3360.279

3360.279 --> 3366.109

3366.109 --> 3370.8489999999997
want

3367.299 --> 3373.579
nobody's telling me how to manage myself

3370.849 --> 3376.6690000000003
or well some people do like to tell me

3373.579 --> 3378.619
from all sides at points like oh you got

3376.669 --> 3378.919
to do this yeah yeah happens all the

3378.619 --> 3381.1690000000003
time

3378.919 --> 3383.6299999999997
I say that's thank you very much for the

3381.169 --> 3386.109
suggestion I think I'll stick to what I

3383.63 --> 3386.109
do though

3398.7 --> 3406.1699999999996
all to see it needs to be fiha a large

3401.73 --> 3412.32
media house he does okay well why don't

3406.17 --> 3414.7200000000003
you try david weiss he knows where to

3412.32 --> 3417.69
put these kind of things he has a lot of

3414.72 --> 3424.6499999999996
contact he has a lot of platform and he

3417.69 --> 3427.349
has a lot of media know-how so yeah if

3424.65 --> 3428.849
you got a package here that you think is

3427.349 --> 3431.339
really important a package of

3428.849 --> 3433.26
information that you need to get out

3431.339 --> 3439.52
there but you don't know how to do it

3433.26 --> 3439.5200000000004
I'd contact him depending on what it is

3440.14 --> 3443.3399999999997
[Music]

3446.359 --> 3451.0989999999997
good servant what are you doing

3463.91 --> 3467.5
yes Rasta

3471.109 --> 3476.869
now when look when I said the situation

3474.079 --> 3479.599
fake it and what I meant is that there's

3476.869 --> 3483.589
that yeah whether there is actually

3479.599 --> 3487.119
somebody that was just genuinely doing

3483.589 --> 3489.979
that for their own reasons

3487.119 --> 3492.559
however manipulated or if it was like a

3489.979 --> 3494.089
like a fake shooting that the police was

3492.559 --> 3498.9100000000003
in the know just to create a situation

3494.089 --> 3498.91
that to figure that out

3521.22 --> 3526.16
hmm don't get too comfortable I have

3526.369 --> 3532.55
might get closer a lot quicker than you

3530.19 --> 3532.55
might imagine

3542.34 --> 3547.869
[Music]

3568.44 --> 3575.569
all right anyway yeah that's what the

3571.14 --> 3580.49
Today Show was about this is crazy

3575.569 --> 3585.15
situations over interests us place and

3580.49 --> 3587.8799999999997
yeah this apparently a movement from

3585.15 --> 3591.51
within Marxist circles and all that and

3587.88 --> 3593.55
the police like and don't replace it so

3591.51 --> 3599.51
corrupt so let's just get rid of it all

3593.55 --> 3605.2200000000003
and the police like tolerating that

3599.51 --> 3606.75
working with that sentiment it's it's

3605.22 --> 3614.0989999999997
one of the most insane things I've ever

3606.75 --> 3616.2
seen out there so yeah it's gonna keep

3614.099 --> 3619.05
on getting my attention to figure out

3616.2 --> 3621.569
just what is going on there like these

3619.05 --> 3625.02
people and like what is gonna happen to

3621.569 --> 3628.2
them to the police that are literally

3625.02 --> 3630.66
part of going along with that like it

3628.2 --> 3634.0989999999997
makes me curious to see what will happen

3630.66 --> 3637.0789999999997
because it's just so crazy to me that

3634.099 --> 3640.05
it's actually happening it becomes hard

3637.079 --> 3643.65
to predict what the outcome will be for

3640.05 --> 3646.53
me it's very easy to start imagining

3643.65 --> 3649.2000000000003
what some kind of special you just this

3646.53 --> 3651.23
or cream outcome or some control

3649.2 --> 3654.27
position but what's really gonna happen

3651.23 --> 3655.98
that's what I'm curious that anyway I'm

3654.27 --> 3657.72
rounding out the show so thanks everyone
