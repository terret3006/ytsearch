use the support so please keep it

98.759 --> 105.88
coming right so weather today

103.28 --> 109.399
again pretty

105.88 --> 112.56
hot was a bit it was a bit weird in the

109.399 --> 115.84
morning there was like and even in the

112.56 --> 121.0
night started noticing like

115.84 --> 123.84
after 4 3 after 3

121.0 --> 126.799
that there was this Mist sort of hanging

123.84 --> 129.36
around and then like later in the

126.799 --> 131.959
morning there was actually a lack of sun

129.36 --> 134.959
because there was so much of

131.959 --> 138.4
it so I thought it was going to be kind

134.959 --> 139.84
of a misty day but yeah it did just I

138.4 --> 144.56
guess

139.84 --> 147.16
disintegrate get reabsorbed by the

144.56 --> 148.319
plants so it's a little bit more moist

147.16 --> 151.04
than it was

148.319 --> 153.28
yesterday the blue a little lighter of

151.04 --> 153.28
the

153.4 --> 160.0
sky but it's a pretty

155.959 --> 162.36
nice day and I think here and there

160.0 --> 166.879
there's a little bit of wind not a lot

162.36 --> 169.72000000000003
though but that does help when it is

166.879 --> 172.07999999999998
there and yeah everything's just uh

169.72 --> 175.2
everything green is

172.08 --> 178.48000000000002
exploding including my mint

175.2 --> 178.48
plant it's

178.76 --> 182.959
like

180.76 --> 185.79899999999998
is just going and going

182.959 --> 187.799
and the shoots are making shoots which

185.799 --> 191.48000000000002
are making shoots and it's just never

187.799 --> 191.48000000000002
it's just fractal

191.56 --> 196.0
mint the mint plant is growing

197.159 --> 204.07999999999998
fractally and is really enjoying his

201.04 --> 208.4
bucket all

204.08 --> 211.519
right other plants are also doing

208.4 --> 215.48000000000002
okay my rosemary plant is oh yeah I

211.519 --> 215.48000000000002
should show that up close it's on full

221.76 --> 226.959
bloom I need to give it a lot of water

225.12 --> 230.28
and it all absorbs

226.959 --> 232.159
it there so I actually give this one

230.28 --> 234.4
water the most regularly but look at

232.159 --> 236.76
this it's

234.4 --> 241.519
just blooming

236.76 --> 245.35999999999999
everywhere not just on the side one

241.519 --> 245.36
amazing you see that

253.68 --> 258.56
guys yeah there's not much of a smell

255.959 --> 263.16
coming off

258.56 --> 263.16
that but they are they look really

268.6 --> 271.6
cute

280.84 --> 288.0
and here is the mint for the up

284.28 --> 288.0
close just look at

294.17 --> 297.60900000000004
[Music]

298.56 --> 301.56
that

303.72 --> 308.639
so this thing is uh Crush

322.08 --> 328.44
again right so I just wanted to share

325.479 --> 332.0
that hello Jeff gas hat first in chat

328.44 --> 334.479
good to see you a virus Richard G fiber

332.0 --> 337.72
oats steamy

334.479 --> 341.919
traveler good to see you

337.72 --> 344.319
all oh my YouTube stuck it's another one

341.919 --> 345.79999999999995
of the thank God that the actual stream

344.319 --> 348.47900000000004
isn't stuck and you guys can keep

345.8 --> 351.12
following it but when I then look at my

348.479 --> 351.12
YouTube it's

351.16 --> 358.759
frozen but that's just fine oh I'll

356.12 --> 361.24
survive you got to watch the sunrise

358.759 --> 363.40000000000003
nice

361.24 --> 367.039
I get some really nice sunsets with this

363.4 --> 369.35999999999996
type of weather so the funny thing is I

367.039 --> 374.08
can stand on the roof right over there

369.36 --> 376.91900000000004
and like on sort of a chimney thing and

374.08 --> 378.8
then like catch the last Light in the

376.919 --> 380.919
entire

378.8 --> 384.599
area I can look around and there's

380.919 --> 384.599
nothing else that's getting

385.4 --> 389.919
hit by the Red Sun because there's like

388.08 --> 392.919
the rest is getting blocked by trees

389.919 --> 396.039
further in into the at the Horizon but

392.919 --> 399.599
it's like pretty amazing and it's like

396.039 --> 402.15999999999997
almost red orange at that

399.599 --> 404.919
point like everything around it looks

402.16 --> 406.639
red orange but the sun itself just is

404.919 --> 409.35999999999996
really yellow and it's

406.639 --> 412.319
this very

409.36 --> 416.88
warm or it's like

412.319 --> 416.88
lessen but it's still just this nice

418.4 --> 422.039
warm

419.96 --> 425.23999999999995
and it's kind of magical to just stand

422.039 --> 427.759
there having the last Sun basically hit

425.24 --> 431.479
you while you smoke a

427.759 --> 431.47900000000004
joint it's kind of

435.319 --> 440.599
magical keep hydrated though

442.199 --> 447.599
anyway let's see what you guys are up to

445.28 --> 450.08
yeah I'm doing great I mean yesterday

447.599 --> 453.639
was a blast

450.08 --> 455.639
I should actually watch it back but I

453.639 --> 460.919
mean

455.639 --> 463.919
dude dir has the things to say and like

460.919 --> 465.35999999999996
he I couldn't like it would have been

463.919 --> 467.599
stupid if it would have broken the

465.36 --> 470.47900000000004
conversation but I actually like lost

467.599 --> 474.039
track a couple of times because well he

470.479 --> 477.4
induced a trans with me because he said

474.039 --> 480.44
like really fractally complicated

477.4 --> 482.75899999999996
things that I was completely complely

480.44 --> 484.56
CAU me flat footage like I

482.759 --> 486.84000000000003
never

484.56 --> 489.12
looked like he was just doing

486.84 --> 491.75899999999996
complicated thinking and I'm not used to

489.12 --> 496.24
other people doing that I'm used to me

491.759 --> 499.199
doing that so it's like wait what

496.24 --> 501.52
but it was fascinating and like he

499.199 --> 503.72
totally gets

501.52 --> 505.19899999999996
things and like he comes up with the

503.72 --> 507.91900000000004
same

505.199 --> 509.68
ideas that's amazing too like he thinks

507.919 --> 511.68
in a direction and just the same thing

509.68 --> 516.6800000000001
start rolling out even though he hasn't

511.68 --> 516.6800000000001
like heard that from me and that's like

517.56 --> 523.3599999999999
fascinating right so yesterday longest

520.36 --> 526.6800000000001
early bird show

523.36 --> 526.6800000000001
ever to

527.2 --> 533.839
date so if you haven't seen that

529.6 --> 533.839
definitely check it out hey hello

535.2 --> 540.519
Emma will I be using that format again

537.959 --> 543.56
yes absolutely

540.519 --> 545.24
and I actually want uh I already asked D

543.56 --> 547.16
Rose I want him to get on with me

545.24 --> 549.8
sometime it's going to be a Monday and a

547.16 --> 549.8
Friday and

550.399 --> 556.36
then probably not a lot but maybe I mean

554.8 --> 558.8389999999999
this is not going to be last time that

556.36 --> 561.36
Nathan just suddenly doesn't have a

558.839 --> 565.12
show so the next time he suddenly

561.36 --> 568.519
doesn't have a show and I get a heads up

565.12 --> 573.32
and it's a Monday or Friday then I can

568.519 --> 573.32
basically arrang to get on with

574.64 --> 582.72
me so that's something and yeah other

578.959 --> 586.5999999999999
people other people like Darth and D

582.72 --> 589.6
Rose that that that where the chemistry

586.6 --> 592.5600000000001
just works well fluid keeps fluid and we

589.6 --> 594.279
can do do esoteric stuff and not really

592.56 --> 597.4399999999999
like lose track of each

594.279 --> 599.53
other just keep riding the waves I need

597.44 --> 601.519
guys like that

599.53 --> 604.76
[Music]

601.519 --> 606.64
and dude I mean if it all works out then

604.76 --> 610.36
maybe we could even like sort of build a

606.64 --> 610.36
panel out of it eventually who

611.88 --> 616.0
knows yeah Richie G I

625.24 --> 631.04
know okay steamy traveler yeah yeah yeah

628.399 --> 631.04
we know

631.519 --> 638.16
but I mean it's not entirely true though

634.88 --> 642.6
it's just that fed is really like the

638.16 --> 645.76
guardian of the lore in ways and I

642.6 --> 648.76
definitely am more like a plant that's

645.76 --> 648.76
growing on that

652.48 --> 657.48
Foundation like I can't imagine doing

655.16 --> 661.04
all this without without having an

657.48 --> 661.04
association with fed

663.0 --> 668.88
I would get overrun by all kinds of

666.68 --> 672.279
weirdos if I

668.88 --> 676.6
wouldn't like fed helped me to become

672.279 --> 679.8
very strict and honest and say screw it

676.6 --> 683.639
all like

679.8 --> 687.7199999999999
screw like popularity numbers in that

683.639 --> 691.8
sense I'm not going to cuck to anything

687.72 --> 694.72
and that part is inspired by

691.8 --> 697.16
fed I mean I always had that in me but I

694.72 --> 699.839
mean it could never just

697.16 --> 702.48
manifest just like that on

699.839 --> 704.24
nothing I had to have some ground to

702.48 --> 707.2
start on and in this case it is

704.24 --> 708.92
literally fed I mean fed

707.2 --> 711.9590000000001
is

708.92 --> 714.24
what like Flat Earth early bird show was

711.959 --> 714.2399999999999
a

714.36 --> 720.32
direct

716.56 --> 722.8389999999999
like thing that came out of of like

720.32 --> 726.5600000000001
let's have an hour before

722.839 --> 729.48
fed to create a win-win situation that

726.56 --> 733.1999999999999
there is something available that's very

729.48 --> 733.2
early I can have the

733.959 --> 739.4799999999999
floor and I can basically get my energy

737.8 --> 742.4399999999999
out of my system because this used to be

739.48 --> 745.9200000000001
a problem with fed okay before I had the

742.44 --> 748.48
early bird show I would be much more

745.92 --> 750.4799999999999
rumpy if you could imagine that haha

748.48 --> 752.6800000000001
very funny but I mean a lot of people

750.48 --> 754.6
were but and you know how it what

752.68 --> 756.5999999999999
happens sometimes it still does an fed

754.6 --> 759.72
on the after show or something if they

756.6 --> 761.72
like just start snapping at me because I

759.72 --> 763.5600000000001
really want to insert something I'll get

761.72 --> 766.24
really

763.56 --> 770.0
angry

766.24 --> 773.199
and yeah that barely happens

770.0 --> 775.88
now thanks to the early bird show

773.199 --> 777.68
although sometimes it's just in the air

775.88 --> 780.36
but then I'll figure it out through the

777.68 --> 783.399
early bir show I'll feel it coming I'll

780.36 --> 786.72
be already like well aware of my mood

783.399 --> 789.68
and then I know like okay I can either

786.72 --> 791.5600000000001
just go right in there and potentially

789.68 --> 793.88
create a clash or it could kind of stay

791.56 --> 793.88
on the

796.16 --> 801.7199999999999
sidelines an hour yeah it started out

798.6 --> 801.72
one hour by

802.079 --> 806.8
roads that's right just look at the

804.519 --> 810.76
earliest Early Bird shows they started

806.8 --> 810.76
out being 1 hour

811.0 --> 814.92
it was already pretty difficult filling

812.68 --> 817.519
that hour because it really was like oh

814.92 --> 820.76
here let's get you woken up let's get

817.519 --> 823.9590000000001
you warmed up the FED is coming soon

820.76 --> 827.48
like that's what the early bird show was

823.959 --> 830.279
it is and I'm not ashamed of that I'm

827.48 --> 833.12
actually well I'm very fond of fed

830.279 --> 837.639
despite the flaws that are

833.12 --> 840.639
present uh but because of just the way

837.639 --> 841.92
it's developed and how serious Nathan it

840.639 --> 845.92
really

841.92 --> 848.0
is like with his own development

845.92 --> 849.759
strategies he's learning he is learning

848.0 --> 853.399
a lot and he's proving he's learning a

849.759 --> 856.0790000000001
lot and so he's like it feels like he's

853.399 --> 859.279
on a similar level of wizard Journey as

856.079 --> 862.04
I am I mean his is much more

859.279 --> 864.68
precise more F he's like yeah he's that

862.04 --> 869.639
gladiator and he has his his sword and

864.68 --> 874.12
he just really knows how to use that

869.639 --> 876.72
and I'm yeah not that

874.12 --> 879.88
specific but he is developing he is

876.72 --> 884.8000000000001
leveling up and so am I arguably even

879.88 --> 887.56
more but I mean I still am like very

884.8 --> 891.12
much like I need I feel I need to be in

887.56 --> 893.8389999999999
a party like I'm a wizard I need a

891.12 --> 897.12
Nathan Oakley with that sword to [ __ ]

893.839 --> 899.8000000000001
chop them down right I need

897.12 --> 904.32
that as a ref

899.8 --> 904.3199999999999
reference as a spiritual reference

906.079 --> 912.6389999999999
frame right and and by the way that's

909.92 --> 914.959
how it grew I mean if suddenly things

912.639 --> 917.88
happen and it discontinues for whatever

914.959 --> 920.68
reason God forbid don't think Nathan has

917.88 --> 924.759
that plan ever is

920.68 --> 926.56
not he's not like oh I I'll do this

924.759 --> 928.92
maybe two more years and then I'm sick

926.56 --> 932.3599999999999
of it like no no it seems to really like

928.92 --> 935.399
want to go for this for the long

932.36 --> 937.639
run but even if it would discontinue for

935.399 --> 940.519
some reason I'd still keep going and I'd

937.639 --> 944.0790000000001
still rest on the memory of that because

940.519 --> 946.079
hey it did happen just because the show

944.079 --> 948.7589999999999
sto doesn't mean that all those things

946.079 --> 951.279
that did happen happened and meant

948.759 --> 954.839
something and have implications that we

951.279 --> 954.8389999999999
can trust on

956.0 --> 960.8
right yeah once you understand the

958.079 --> 963.12
argument that's

960.8 --> 967.5999999999999
right tend to listen to these types of

963.12 --> 967.6
streams right because I'm not just

967.839 --> 973.2790000000001
housekeeping and there is definitely a

970.24 --> 975.319
function for it to have it regularly

973.279 --> 977.8389999999999
otherwise it wouldn't be housekeeping

975.319 --> 979.759
and all that and to argue about these

977.839 --> 982.1600000000001
things and to look at the opponent like

979.759 --> 985.319
what are they doing with it right that I

982.16 --> 988.0
find myself spending most of the time on

985.319 --> 990.319
fed figuring out what the anti flat

988.0 --> 992.839
earthers do and how they do it and then

990.319 --> 995.68
I emulate it and then I get carried away

992.839 --> 996.48
and then I expand upon the creation that

995.68 --> 1000.399
they

996.48 --> 1002.16
have like in the hopes which is kind of

1000.399 --> 1003.639
freaky but in the hopes that they are

1002.16 --> 1006.279
actually going to get it and then take

1003.639 --> 1008.04
it and then I can point in it and say I

1006.279 --> 1012.399
made them do

1008.04 --> 1012.399
this it it's creepy I

1013.12 --> 1018.68
guess but I I I feel I can have that

1016.24 --> 1021.0790000000001
luxury because it's utter like it's all

1018.68 --> 1024.24
fly what the fanti flaters do is all

1021.079 --> 1027.76
Folly so do we just want to catch them

1024.24 --> 1029.839
on total double speak contradicting

1027.76 --> 1031.52
themselves every 10 seconds and denying

1029.839 --> 1034.3999999999999
it and then you play the recording and

1031.52 --> 1037.039
they still deny that do we want that

1034.4 --> 1040.3600000000001
continually or do we want to have them

1037.039 --> 1042.199
actually spout very creative

1040.36 --> 1044.4799999999998
constructions that are at least

1042.199 --> 1047.4
interesting to listen to and make your

1044.48 --> 1050.559
mind like it's a challenge to figure out

1047.4 --> 1053.24
what that is would you rather want that

1050.559 --> 1056.72
because that's what I can help provide

1053.24 --> 1056.72
them with

1057.2 --> 1063.4
Ballwin so that at least it's not just

1060.0 --> 1065.88
the stupid double speak continually and

1063.4 --> 1068.2800000000002
the endless rassing and whining about

1065.88 --> 1071.679
the format right because I think we're

1068.28 --> 1074.559
all pretty sick of that at this point

1071.679 --> 1075.9
for a while you

1074.559 --> 1077.1589999999999
know

1075.9 --> 1080.4
[Music]

1077.159 --> 1083.8400000000001
so yeah

1080.4 --> 1087.44
Balwin has an actual

1083.84 --> 1091.3999999999999
function he's not just a

1087.44 --> 1093.679
joke and that part of my conscience is

1091.4 --> 1096.1200000000001
like really elated about it because he

1093.679 --> 1099.2
literally went to

1096.12 --> 1101.559
sleep for a very long

1099.2 --> 1105.0
time in the hopes that he would be able

1101.559 --> 1107.24
to wake up again and he has and the

1105.0 --> 1109.6
world is different now to boen because

1107.24 --> 1110.679
now he's together with with older

1109.6 --> 1113.6399999999999
brother

1110.679 --> 1117.4
Arwin that definitely knows better and

1113.64 --> 1120.3600000000001
he like is subservient to

1117.4 --> 1123.799
Arwin but at least he can be himself

1120.36 --> 1126.6789999999999
like how he wanted to be to roll out

1123.799 --> 1129.0
that that mythical vision of the ball

1126.679 --> 1132.3200000000002
Earth and how you should think of it

1129.0 --> 1135.64
being a ball Earth how to do that

1132.32 --> 1135.6399999999999
correctly as an

1135.88 --> 1143.0390000000002
art a mind art

1139.76 --> 1145.64
cuz that's how I saw it even back then

1143.039 --> 1146.6
that was the one thing that I jumped to

1145.64 --> 1149.64
instead

1146.6 --> 1152.32
of it's a lie everybody's stupid oh I

1149.64 --> 1155.6000000000001
can just [ __ ] them over with it instead

1152.32 --> 1157.8799999999999
of that I was like whoa I get this this

1155.6 --> 1159.039
is like the perfect distraction for

1157.88 --> 1162.2800000000002
extreme

1159.039 --> 1165.679
Brilliance because extreme Brilliance

1162.28 --> 1169.1589999999999
often get snuffed out because it there's

1165.679 --> 1171.96
nothing there to challenge it and then

1169.159 --> 1171.96
you just get

1173.44 --> 1178.28
nightmares and eventually you lose your

1176.36 --> 1180.32
Brilliance because you start to suppress

1178.28 --> 1182.48
it because it just you associate

1180.32 --> 1184.799
intelligence with nightmares that's what

1182.48 --> 1186.919
happens I believe with a lot of people

1184.799 --> 1189.8799999999999
in this

1186.919 --> 1192.159
world that everybody actually has a much

1189.88 --> 1193.0
higher potential for being intelligent

1192.159 --> 1195.8400000000001
and

1193.0 --> 1197.919
Brilliant but that they snuff it

1195.84 --> 1200.799
themselves as in spiritual action

1197.919 --> 1202.159
because well with Brilliance with power

1200.799 --> 1205.24
comes a lot of

1202.159 --> 1208.159
responsibility and you could also say a

1205.24 --> 1211.44
curse there's a counter

1208.159 --> 1213.2800000000002
force that you have to deal with always

1211.44 --> 1216.3200000000002
and if you don't well then the counter

1213.28 --> 1219.72
Force basically snuffs out your

1216.32 --> 1223.28
intelligence you you

1219.72 --> 1225.72
impose being more simple on yourself you

1223.28 --> 1229.36
impose that you don't think you can get

1225.72 --> 1230.919
a grasp on it on yourself

1229.36 --> 1233.7199999999998
and then you believe that and then you

1230.919 --> 1233.72
settle for

1234.12 --> 1240.28
that you become that and when you become

1237.4 --> 1242.48
a role and you're fully convinced then

1240.28 --> 1244.76
eventually the likelihood of losing

1242.48 --> 1248.76
track of old skills and old potential

1244.76 --> 1250.8799999999999
old Curiosities is great and only

1248.76 --> 1252.919
somebody else reminding you of it and

1250.88 --> 1256.48
you in that moment being capable of

1252.919 --> 1259.44
allowing it back in is able is what's

1256.48 --> 1261.64
able to reignite it

1259.44 --> 1264.28
cuz if there's no other thing that

1261.64 --> 1267.24
basically triggers that then you don't

1264.28 --> 1269.3999999999999
even know you had it you forgot about it

1267.24 --> 1271.6
because you had all these things imposed

1269.4 --> 1271.6000000000001
on

1272.64 --> 1278.5200000000002
yourself right so with Ballwin I am

1276.24 --> 1280.1200000000001
basically triggering all ball Believers

1278.52 --> 1283.24
with the

1280.12 --> 1287.36
creativity that made it so

1283.24 --> 1289.88
awesome right why did a lot of people

1287.36 --> 1292.4799999999998
love it so much because it inspired them

1289.88 --> 1295.0
so much and they just went painting man

1292.48 --> 1297.32
and like oh I got this Vision stuff of

1295.0 --> 1301.44
like planets and orbits and it's just

1297.32 --> 1304.9189999999999
they were so like whoa it's so awesome

1301.44 --> 1307.279
right well that's all just been lost

1304.919 --> 1310.48
because it's kind of figured out that

1307.279 --> 1312.32
it's a dream now for real it's it was

1310.48 --> 1316.44
back then something well what might

1312.32 --> 1319.2
really be that but now it's like I it

1316.44 --> 1323.279
turns out it's definitely

1319.2 --> 1326.2
not and now the the corporation the the

1323.279 --> 1328.6
NASA the religion is still just keeping

1326.2 --> 1331.44
going and [ __ ] it up and they're

1328.6 --> 1335.48
almost doing it on purpose and that's

1331.44 --> 1337.3600000000001
just further depleting that original

1335.48 --> 1340.799
like yeah that

1337.36 --> 1343.12
buzz that came out of it that people

1340.799 --> 1345.0
were enjoying so much at the time when

1343.12 --> 1346.279
they still didn't know for sure whether

1345.0 --> 1348.48
it was

1346.279 --> 1352.84
fake was very inspire

1348.48 --> 1352.84
iring right but the knowing

1354.08 --> 1358.72
matters it's a supernatural thing and

1356.84 --> 1362.12
it's scientifically proven that there is

1358.72 --> 1365.1200000000001
a knowing so it

1362.12 --> 1365.12
matters

1367.64 --> 1374.44
H what was my point again right the

1371.44 --> 1376.96
dreaming I'm trying to sort of reignite

1374.44 --> 1380.52
that I guess

1376.96 --> 1384.679
70s cultural enthusiasm that rode on the

1380.52 --> 1387.4
moon landing it did that's hippie dippy

1384.679 --> 1389.279
but it still brought a lot of energy and

1387.4 --> 1393.52
a lot of Hope and

1389.279 --> 1396.679
hope brings procreation yeah a lot of

1393.52 --> 1400.12
hippies procreated okay there's a lot of

1396.679 --> 1402.679
hippie kids you're looking at one

1400.12 --> 1404.52
literally I mean my parents were as

1402.679 --> 1408.0
hippus as you can imagine I'm not even

1404.52 --> 1409.1589999999999
going to tell you the full story because

1408.0 --> 1413.12
it's a bit

1409.159 --> 1417.159
embarrassing how hippie a [ __ ] was

1413.12 --> 1417.1589999999999
really but I

1417.679 --> 1426.4
mean our world is being attacked as the

1422.159 --> 1429.3200000000002
world I guess back then a decade before

1426.4 --> 1432.039
had been or well a decade two decades

1429.32 --> 1433.72
before had been attacked and a lot of

1432.039 --> 1436.8799999999999
population was

1433.72 --> 1439.64
lost like in Europe huge

1436.88 --> 1443.0800000000002
amounts

1439.64 --> 1445.039
and the hippie dippy [ __ ] and the space

1443.08 --> 1448.72
dream did bring a lot of inspiration

1445.039 --> 1452.64
back and a lot of Hope and did yeah we

1448.72 --> 1452.64
created the baby boom

1452.679 --> 1459.6000000000001
right wait no the baby boom is actually

1455.64 --> 1459.6000000000001
what became the hippie generation hold

1460.559 --> 1463.559
on

1464.2 --> 1470.32
right whatever maybe I'm just literally

1467.96 --> 1472.3600000000001
ball wi side is secretly making sort of

1470.32 --> 1475.559
trying to make up a justification for

1472.36 --> 1477.4399999999998
him to I just think that it's more

1475.559 --> 1481.8799999999999
interesting listening

1477.44 --> 1485.96
to ball Fantastical mind constructions

1481.88 --> 1489.0
than to just whing romping

1485.96 --> 1492.52
self-contradicting format complaining

1489.0 --> 1495.64
trolls basically you

1492.52 --> 1499.76
know I'm just trying

1495.64 --> 1499.76
to spice it up

1500.52 --> 1504.1589999999999
I mean I'm going to be dealing with them

1502.12 --> 1506.9599999999998
through Fed

1504.159 --> 1510.24
so maybe they can [ __ ] get a hint how

1506.96 --> 1510.24
to do it properly

1523.52 --> 1528.279
already I used to like that hippie chick

1526.679 --> 1531.0
song I don't know which song you're

1528.279 --> 1533.84
talking about just

1531.0 --> 1537.0
being I'm not familiar with the all the

1533.84 --> 1540.6
hippie music to be fair I'm not super

1537.0 --> 1540.6
impressed with the actual hippie

1541.0 --> 1546.52
music I mean it was very cool for them

1544.48 --> 1549.919
back then but I mean there's so much

1546.52 --> 1549.9189999999999
more fascinating music

1552.919 --> 1558.76
now

1555.44 --> 1561.919
but the times were very interesting and

1558.76 --> 1563.919
just it is on record that people were

1561.919 --> 1568.279
just really into

1563.919 --> 1568.279
it were dreaming like

1568.76 --> 1579.919
crazy and like with joy not

1574.08 --> 1583.84
just a bunch of lame demoralized

1579.919 --> 1586.6000000000001
winers like what you now get out there I

1583.84 --> 1589.4399999999998
mean these sjw figures they're all

1586.6 --> 1593.9189999999999
demoralized

1589.44 --> 1596.64
they're all they all suck hippies didn't

1593.919 --> 1598.279
suck back then well some of them would

1596.64 --> 1602.0
of course because those persons would

1598.279 --> 1604.12
just inherently suck but the hippies on

1602.0 --> 1607.76
average did not suck at all they would

1604.12 --> 1609.8799999999999
be just very high energy and some of

1607.76 --> 1611.52
them would get a little out there when

1609.88 --> 1615.44
they start talking and when they start

1611.52 --> 1616.96
telling stories right and that's kind of

1615.44 --> 1618.44
what they were like they were not

1616.96 --> 1621.44
demoralized

1618.44 --> 1623.0800000000002
in but they would be rebellious though

1621.44 --> 1625.3200000000002
it's like on the work floor it could be

1623.08 --> 1631.36
annoying because they would always like

1625.32 --> 1631.36
start like say like this is wrong and oh

1631.72 --> 1636.3600000000001
equality but just like having them

1637.48 --> 1641.76
around was a lot of energy going

1644.24 --> 1649.32
around high energy yeah very funny Akuma

1647.32 --> 1652.0
virus

1649.32 --> 1655.48
where are my tie-dyed shirts uh they're

1652.0 --> 1660.96
in a box somewhere I I do have

1655.48 --> 1664.44
them and yes I used to be a hippie kind

1660.96 --> 1664.44
of without a

1668.0 --> 1672.559
mustache ah anyway I'm going to eat this

1671.12 --> 1675.6
I'm really

1672.559 --> 1679.519
hungry uh I did not eat super much

1675.6 --> 1679.519
yesterday cheers

1688.679 --> 1695.0800000000002
H wow cool slowo moon

1692.72 --> 1698.44
buggy my mother used to hang out with

1695.08 --> 1701.1589999999999
Miles Davis n not really but she did

1698.44 --> 1701.159
meet him like

1701.64 --> 1708.24
once I think actually maybe I even met

1705.279 --> 1710.64
Miles Davis one time but vaguely

1708.24 --> 1710.64
remember

1721.72 --> 1729.6000000000001
it Fusion

1723.96 --> 1729.6000000000001
stuff well I like the the old Miles

1736.399 --> 1739.399
Davis

1739.559 --> 1744.6
like it was this

1741.08 --> 1748.1999999999998
one album we

1744.6 --> 1751.08
had uh I think it's like collors it's

1748.2 --> 1752.159
like it was might even be called colors

1751.08 --> 1755.24
that

1752.159 --> 1758.7990000000002
one is

1755.24 --> 1761.24
just it's magical because it's almost

1758.799 --> 1765.799
like a like a classical

1761.24 --> 1768.919
composition and how there how it is a a

1765.799 --> 1771.36
feel it is just so much to

1768.919 --> 1774.0
it it's been a while since I heard that

1771.36 --> 1777.6399999999999
but like that one is really impressive

1774.0 --> 1779.24
it's before it gets all out there and

1777.64 --> 1782.44
and like

1779.24 --> 1785.6
uh durges

1782.44 --> 1789.0800000000002
right it's before the Jazz just goes out

1785.6 --> 1789.08
of control starts to turn into a

1789.24 --> 1793.88
durge Kind of Blue right that one yeah

1796.32 --> 1799.32
yeah

1802.159 --> 1806.3200000000002
I

1803.44 --> 1808.559
think I don't actually have the CD of

1806.32 --> 1812.36
that it might be on my computer

1808.559 --> 1812.36
somewhere I think I may have downloaded

1813.32 --> 1817.1589999999999
it kilometers

1817.399 --> 1820.6399999999999
Davies okay

1821.96 --> 1829.24
MMA that joke really shows your

1825.64 --> 1829.24
AG nah

1833.36 --> 1840.6
it's like a person of my age and older

1837.76 --> 1840.6
wouldn't make that

1844.44 --> 1849.3600000000001
joke because like Miles Davis is like

1846.919 --> 1851.72
one of the most respected musicians of

1849.36 --> 1851.7199999999998
all

1855.279 --> 1860.6
time like especially in in the old

1857.72 --> 1863.24
liberal World which is well where what

1860.6 --> 1865.76
my mother where my mother was hanging

1863.24 --> 1865.76
most of the

1869.039 --> 1873.639
time yeah nobody [ __ ] with miles

1871.32 --> 1873.639
that's

1886.159 --> 1892.3990000000001
right

1889.039 --> 1897.559
okay yes fibro he gets it but yeah

1892.399 --> 1897.559
that's true he is like highly revered

1899.48 --> 1906.1200000000001
musician and his death was like mourned

1902.6 --> 1906.12
internationally all over

1910.6 --> 1916.399
television he was like sort of

1912.84 --> 1920.1999999999998
comparable to like what Mandela was in

1916.399 --> 1920.1999999999998
politics he was that in jazz

1923.279 --> 1927.6
music yeah that comparison doesn't

1925.96 --> 1931.919
really age well but I'm literally

1927.6 --> 1931.9189999999999
looking from how it looked like in the

1941.32 --> 1946.519
9s no it's fine

1943.96 --> 1948.559
M I'm not saying you're disrespecting

1946.519 --> 1951.279
I'm just saying that somebody of my age

1948.559 --> 1951.279
and older

1952.44 --> 1956.3990000000001
wouldn't like they wouldn't think of

1954.6 --> 1960.12
saying such a thing even though it's

1956.399 --> 1962.4399999999998
very okay it's it's not that bad a

1960.12 --> 1965.08
joke it's just you don't [ __ ] around

1962.44 --> 1967.6000000000001
with Miles as fibro say that is just how

1965.08 --> 1967.6
we grew

1970.88 --> 1973.88
up

1976.039 --> 1979.039
what

1982.48 --> 1988.6390000000001
okay fiber out I don't think uh there's

1985.6 --> 1991.12
still witches out there literally

1988.639 --> 1992.8799999999999
cursing people for doing that although

1991.12 --> 1995.1999999999998
they might have actually been doing that

1992.88 --> 1995.2
back

1995.679 --> 2000.3990000000001
then it's kind of weird that you joke

1998.08 --> 2000.399
about

2005.72 --> 2009.72
that yeah miles was

2010.0 --> 2015.96
cranky and he had like a a racism

2013.48 --> 2017.679
complex but I mean he did like get

2015.96 --> 2021.6000000000001
really mistreated and

2017.679 --> 2021.6000000000001
[ __ ] like in his younger

2024.08 --> 2030.6
years if I remember correctly he had a

2027.36 --> 2032.84
pretty shitty dad that was violent and

2030.6 --> 2035.9599999999998
the police there were like

2032.84 --> 2038.9599999999998
police just out for him and [ __ ] on

2035.96 --> 2041.279
record

2038.96 --> 2044.6390000000001
like he got beat up one time because he

2041.279 --> 2047.2
was smoking on his break while he was in

2044.639 --> 2050.48
the middle of a concert got beat up by

2047.2 --> 2053.04
some cop like what the [ __ ] but yeah I

2050.48 --> 2056.52
mean he had some serious racism complex

2053.04 --> 2056.52
like he did not like white

2061.679 --> 2067.04
people like he respected my mother

2064.32 --> 2069.56
enough who was very white he respected

2067.04 --> 2072.48
her enough for her pass with pass

2069.56 --> 2074.96
passion with music and Jazz to even

2072.48 --> 2077.56
basically meet

2074.96 --> 2080.639
her because it's

2077.56 --> 2083.44
like well you're pretty like you're

2080.639 --> 2085.839
white but you're pretty cool like he was

2083.44 --> 2088.679
like that he really was and it wasn't

2085.839 --> 2091.639
like because he was conditioned by some

2088.679 --> 2095.76
communist or something no it's just

2091.639 --> 2095.76
that's how he developed

2095.879 --> 2098.879
himself

2125.8 --> 2128.8
m

2142.16 --> 2149.52
yeah I'm a but I mean he was just using

2146.04 --> 2149.52
hard trucks and that [ __ ] you

2149.599 --> 2154.52
up I mean there's a documentary about

2152.4 --> 2155.8
him out there even on Netflix that I

2154.52 --> 2158.48
watched a while

2155.8 --> 2162.079
ago and I mean his entire life is total

2158.48 --> 2164.04
[ __ ] chaos and like complete [ __ ]

2162.079 --> 2166.52
chaos

2164.04 --> 2169.2
endless crazy

2166.52 --> 2173.24
[ __ ]

2169.2 --> 2176.24
drugs depression and [ __ ]

2173.24 --> 2176.24
and

2178.56 --> 2183.96
arguments I don't remember exactly what

2181.319 --> 2185.72
but like it I remember is giant hassle

2183.96 --> 2188.04
like all of

2185.72 --> 2191.359
it

2188.04 --> 2195.0
like he would never be actually bored it

2191.359 --> 2195.0
was more like about

2195.119 --> 2200.119
like his ego could just be like very

2201.48 --> 2208.96
complicated where just not cooperating

2205.04 --> 2211.119
like he was considerably so talented

2208.96 --> 2214.88
with his

2211.119 --> 2216.319
music that like he felt a a barrier

2214.88 --> 2218.48
between himself and the rest of the

2216.319 --> 2222.24
world and it felt at times like you're

2218.48 --> 2222.2400000000002
all just trying to leech off my

2222.48 --> 2227.56
talent and that made it very complicated

2228.72 --> 2234.359
chemistry and I know about that sort of

2231.04 --> 2234.359
thing I have that at times

2243.52 --> 2249.7599999999998
too I'm glad I acely been able to kind

2247.96 --> 2254.4
of

2249.76 --> 2254.4
like build down the barrier a

2257.64 --> 2264.16
bit

2259.92 --> 2264.16
myself Prince worship miles

2275.599 --> 2278.599
yeah

2279.52 --> 2285.28
I don't know though it's

2281.4 --> 2289.76
like my family was into that like Prince

2285.28 --> 2292.3190000000004
my brother was into Prince a lot most

2289.76 --> 2295.6400000000003
Davis I was not

2292.319 --> 2298.839
though for some reason I've just been

2295.64 --> 2298.839
like a white music

2302.24 --> 2307.5989999999997
chaser I'm just so damn

2305.52 --> 2309.92
white

2307.599 --> 2313.04
like I like the

2309.92 --> 2316.4
police I like Kate Bush like that's what

2313.04 --> 2319.119
I was listening to when I was young and

2316.4 --> 2321.079
other things it's like it's all white

2319.119 --> 2324.319
for some reason I it's not like I picked

2321.079 --> 2324.319
them out like that it's just

2324.64 --> 2328.56
that that's pretty white

2335.52 --> 2339.079
yeah

2337.2 --> 2341.319
and I definitely did like Prince like

2339.079 --> 2345.44
Prince was

2341.319 --> 2347.64
like was like our radio because if there

2345.44 --> 2350.16
was like a a journey in the car then

2347.64 --> 2352.72
Prince would be

2350.16 --> 2356.0789999999997
played but I for example was like more

2352.72 --> 2359.1189999999997
into rert Hines a weird obscure band

2356.079 --> 2362.0
that nobody ever heard of with like

2359.119 --> 2364.48
early electronic

2362.0 --> 2367.359
musics and that's as white as it can

2364.48 --> 2370.839
[ __ ] get like that's the whitest

2367.359 --> 2374.119
[ __ ] music I've ever heard sort

2370.839 --> 2377.16
of maybe somebody will disagree it just

2374.119 --> 2377.1600000000003
maybe it's

2377.839 --> 2382.4
like I don't

2379.8 --> 2386.28
know the guy is

2382.4 --> 2386.28
white I wonder if he's still

2395.4 --> 2398.4
around

2402.319 --> 2409.0
yeah dude police I got them all show

2406.04 --> 2411.48
it I don't really actively listen to it

2409.0 --> 2411.48
anymore

2424.68 --> 2431.2
but best CD in the world at the

2428.64 --> 2435.0
time

2431.2 --> 2435.0
right Outland do

2435.76 --> 2443.2000000000003
that zenyata mondata oh this one was

2440.2 --> 2445.7599999999998
like so surreal to me and of course

2443.2 --> 2445.7599999999998
ghost in the

2448.6 --> 2452.68
[Music]

2449.839 --> 2455.2799999999997
machine there's one picture like we had

2452.68 --> 2457.04
the original album of this and there's

2455.28 --> 2461.079
like a picture in there

2457.04 --> 2463.7599999999998
that I had such nightmares over as a kid

2461.079 --> 2463.76
it's so

2464.24 --> 2470.2799999999997
creepy oh it's in there so [ __ ] creep

2467.76 --> 2474.5600000000004
like it's very small here but I mean

2470.28 --> 2474.5600000000004
like it was like what the [ __ ] is

2474.72 --> 2481.2
that right there under my

2477.96 --> 2481.2
finger hold

2482.68 --> 2488.24
on can you see

2485.24 --> 2488.24
that

2489.119 --> 2492.359
yeah I'm

2495.2 --> 2500.48
like and like nothing explains what the

2498.0 --> 2500.48
[ __ ] that

2504.04 --> 2512.119
is it's like a molten pig mask thing or

2509.0 --> 2512.119
something really [ __ ]

2515.24 --> 2518.24
up

2518.96 --> 2524.92
but I mean Kate Bush I listened a lot

2521.72 --> 2530.359
more this is just

2524.92 --> 2530.359
like one of the best CDs of all

2531.8 --> 2538.319
time it's like main even being

2534.68 --> 2541.52
mainstream can't ruin this that's how

2538.319 --> 2544.0
good Kate Bush is weirdly enough she has

2541.52 --> 2547.359
some new stuff too but it's all weird

2544.0 --> 2549.839
it's not really super interesting lot of

2547.359 --> 2552.68
recycling but

2549.839 --> 2556.2
yeah everybody knows hounds of

2552.68 --> 2557.64
Love barely anybody though knows the

2556.2 --> 2561.2
ninth

2557.64 --> 2564.7999999999997
wave which is one of the most surreal

2561.2 --> 2569.0
albums that has ever been

2564.8 --> 2572.119
made and it has like the most amazing

2569.0 --> 2573.72
Celtic like Irish jig in it that I've

2572.119 --> 2576.1600000000003
ever heard and the first one I've ever

2573.72 --> 2578.319
heard and I know the entire song pattern

2576.16 --> 2581.3999999999996
completely by heart and can literally

2578.319 --> 2581.4
sing that which is

2581.88 --> 2587.92
crazy uh it's very complicated but

2584.88 --> 2589.76
that's why I'm obsessed with that like

2587.92 --> 2591.44
I'm obsessed with really complicated

2589.76 --> 2594.0400000000004
Melodies and this is like one of the

2591.44 --> 2594.04
best ones

2599.48 --> 2606.599
ever the entire CD is just amazing it's

2603.64 --> 2610.0
like a it's a movie the C

2606.599 --> 2612.6400000000003
is like a movie you listen to that's

2610.0 --> 2614.96
really what it is there's so much

2612.64 --> 2618.96
happening in the soundscape during that

2614.96 --> 2618.96
entire CD the N wave it's

2622.559 --> 2627.0400000000004
incredible it really feels like you're

2625.0 --> 2629.16
watching a movie except you're not

2627.04 --> 2633.0
watching a screen when you listen to

2629.16 --> 2635.68
that I the the music videos are kind of

2633.0 --> 2638.24
irrelevant I wouldn't watch the videos

2635.68 --> 2641.68
as I would be

2638.24 --> 2645.1189999999997
listening just listen and then like

2641.68 --> 2645.1189999999997
magic happens in your

2648.24 --> 2651.24
mind

2655.8 --> 2660.1600000000003
anyway so that's like what I listen pre

2658.96 --> 2662.2400000000002
teen

2660.16 --> 2664.44
mostly was that that was what I was

2662.24 --> 2664.4399999999996
really

2665.0 --> 2669.48
into

2666.72 --> 2669.48
and rert

2673.52 --> 2679.28
Hines but I I lik rert Hines because

2676.48 --> 2682.44
it's like his songs are like about

2679.28 --> 2685.0
complicated inner struggles and [ __ ] and

2682.44 --> 2688.839
psychological of the arrangements and

2685.0 --> 2691.04
how they how they work like it and very

2688.839 --> 2693.7599999999998
philosophical too

2691.04 --> 2696.079
like high spiritual ideas in his

2693.76 --> 2701.6400000000003
interpretation so I always thought like

2696.079 --> 2701.6400000000003
Robert Hines that one CD is just really

2702.119 --> 2709.2000000000003
interesting sting yeah well sting is is

2706.559 --> 2711.6800000000003
cool but I mean I liked it more in the

2709.2 --> 2711.68
police

2717.92 --> 2727.88
really I thought sting like felt more

2723.76 --> 2727.88
manipulative when he was going solo

2730.119 --> 2735.04
it was always like pulling at your heart

2732.64 --> 2738.0
strings and he's literally sold out the

2735.04 --> 2741.2
the whole climate change agenda like

2738.0 --> 2741.2
that's very obvious

2746.359 --> 2752.5989999999997
now yeah that's right

2749.319 --> 2752.599
Emma what a

2754.88 --> 2757.88
shame

2758.8 --> 2763.1600000000003
yeah so I don't like Sting anymore I

2760.599 --> 2765.44
mean it's a real it's like it feels like

2763.16 --> 2767.64
an old friend that basically just went

2765.44 --> 2767.64
to

2767.68 --> 2772.3999999999996
[ __ ] I don't like like I'm

2772.72 --> 2777.5589999999997
sad but yeah I mean everybody makes

2775.44 --> 2779.96
their own choices in life you know can't

2777.559 --> 2779.96
force

2784.8 --> 2787.8
anybody

2787.96 --> 2792.8
yes a live with

2789.64 --> 2792.7999999999997
it right

2805.6 --> 2808.69
[Music]

2814.8 --> 2821.4
cheers

2817.599 --> 2823.8
right but yeah what with Kate Bush what

2821.4 --> 2826.8
really like Sting

2823.8 --> 2831.52
or the police yeah he is like the writer

2826.8 --> 2836.44
but like he's very very good at making

2831.52 --> 2836.44
like composing music he's like a genius

2837.16 --> 2840.52
composer and that's really the thing

2839.16 --> 2842.68
that stands out that's what made him

2840.52 --> 2846.079
kind of a special boy that's what got up

2842.68 --> 2847.68
his own ass too but he is he is a

2846.079 --> 2850.119
composer and that really shows in the

2847.68 --> 2851.44
police a lot that's where it was really

2850.119 --> 2854.2400000000002
picked

2851.44 --> 2857.0
up and then the gravers got to him and

2854.24 --> 2859.68
then buried him under money and then he

2857.0 --> 2859.68
turned into a

2862.72 --> 2869.0789999999997
devil but Kade

2865.96 --> 2871.88
Bush Kate Bush is something

2869.079 --> 2874.119
else like Kate Bush is like a creative

2871.88 --> 2876.6800000000003
genius she's still at it and she's ups

2874.119 --> 2878.079
and downs which is log IAL if you're a

2876.68 --> 2881.0789999999997
genius

2878.079 --> 2885.76
artist but when she was

2881.079 --> 2888.3590000000004
young she had the most amazing voice

2885.76 --> 2890.76
control that I've ever heard and I mean

2888.359 --> 2894.2
yeah there's some really good ones now

2890.76 --> 2897.2000000000003
out there Adele is really good I think

2894.2 --> 2901.839
but Kate Bush had like

2897.2 --> 2906.4399999999996
a she could just like do Taekwondo with

2901.839 --> 2908.68
her voice it was unbelievable like she

2906.44 --> 2911.079
can't do that anymore but like when she

2908.68 --> 2912.839
was in her Peak she had just these

2911.079 --> 2916.7200000000003
recordings where she had like the most

2912.839 --> 2918.599
crisp clear perfect sound recording and

2916.72 --> 2919.9199999999996
would just use her voice in Her sing

2918.599 --> 2923.52
that's just

2919.92 --> 2927.44
like like it gives me the

2923.52 --> 2929.16
Shivers and that is absolutely maximized

2927.44 --> 2932.079
in the nth

2929.16 --> 2934.44
Wave It's the absolute peak of her

2932.079 --> 2939.28
entire career and it's like I've never

2934.44 --> 2941.599
heard anybody like like match that level

2939.28 --> 2944.4
since which is incredible because it's

2941.599 --> 2944.4
such a long time

2945.68 --> 2953.839
ago but nobody's managed that

2950.96 --> 2956.64
cohesion what she put

2953.839 --> 2961.48
together and I don't think that even she

2956.64 --> 2961.48
managed to put it to reconstruct

2961.76 --> 2968.6400000000003
it also because well it was really her

2965.319 --> 2970.599
voice voice power that made it also work

2968.64 --> 2973.24
like her voice in between if her voice

2970.599 --> 2975.7200000000003
is not in there you're just like okay

2973.24 --> 2979.0789999999997
this is kind of weird music but her

2975.72 --> 2983.2
voice in it is what made the magic

2979.079 --> 2987.119
complete you'd love hius

2983.2 --> 2987.1189999999997
coyote okay never heard of

2987.68 --> 2992.359
it recently released new stuff yeah I

2990.16 --> 2992.359
know

2993.48 --> 2999.25
Emma so she's still added

2996.799 --> 3001.359
I think she's a pretty good person

2999.25 --> 3004.28
[Music]

3001.359 --> 3007.68
actually like I think she's like not

3004.28 --> 3007.6800000000003
corrupt to the system or

3008.599 --> 3015.079
something it's

3010.88 --> 3015.079
fascinating but

3019.16 --> 3022.48
yeah it's

3022.92 --> 3029.839
like I'd love to like see a concert of

3026.119 --> 3032.28
hers just to like meet her and like just

3029.839 --> 3034.68
like wow it's actually Kate Bush This is

3032.28 --> 3039.2000000000003
Amazing because like it's not going to

3034.68 --> 3044.16
be even close to being as awesome as the

3039.2 --> 3044.16
original album recordings it's just a

3044.76 --> 3049.92
fact but it would still have a lot of

3047.48 --> 3053.52
great feels I did see like a recording

3049.92 --> 3056.119
of a concert she did not too long ago or

3053.52 --> 3059.16
like somewhere within a decade

3056.119 --> 3062.079
too it had like even orchestral and all

3059.16 --> 3064.359
that that was really

3062.079 --> 3067.3590000000004
awesome that was really

3064.359 --> 3070.359
fascinating so she's still doing

3067.359 --> 3070.359
stuff

3084.359 --> 3089.68
anyway yeah so that's like one of those

3087.68 --> 3092.1189999999997
things that they really like to run play

3089.68 --> 3093.799
running up that hill

3092.119 --> 3097.839
in

3093.799 --> 3103.28
uh in stranger things like yeah that

3097.839 --> 3107.319
really works on me it's like yeah click

3103.28 --> 3111.079
oh it's freaking the80s I'm a little

3107.319 --> 3111.079
kid it it does

3114.359 --> 3117.359
work

3121.119 --> 3128.44
and I mean that music made me feel like

3123.319 --> 3130.92
a really really special boy that was

3128.44 --> 3133.16
magical Kate Bush was almost sort of

3130.92 --> 3133.16
like

3135.88 --> 3140.6400000000003
my my fairy Godmother or

3141.39 --> 3147.2799999999997
[Music]

3144.28 --> 3147.28
something

3149.2 --> 3158.1189999999997
she partly helped me get inspired to

3154.28 --> 3158.119
basically hold on to

3159.2 --> 3167.68
Magic and to just decide like no I I'm

3164.24 --> 3170.5989999999997
not going to like deny that it

3167.68 --> 3175.24
exists like I will not let the world

3170.599 --> 3179.2000000000003
push that push me to extinguish that cuz

3175.24 --> 3179.2
you're not supposed to believe it I was

3180.319 --> 3187.52
never I would forget about

3184.4 --> 3190.2000000000003
it but I would never like truly force

3187.52 --> 3194.28
myself like no it's not real it can't be

3190.2 --> 3197.839
real no it's like no like everything is

3194.28 --> 3201.0400000000004
real everything is

3197.839 --> 3202.7599999999998
real people just can't handle the truth

3201.04 --> 3206.119
and I didn't even know that saying back

3202.76 --> 3208.96
then but I just knew that that was

3206.119 --> 3210.799
true I was always just super

3208.96 --> 3213.2400000000002
disappointed that nobody could handle

3210.799 --> 3214.72
that nobody always bumping into people

3213.24 --> 3217.35
not being able to handle the truth and

3214.72 --> 3220.4489999999996
I'm just trying to climb and

3217.35 --> 3220.449
[Music]

3223.96 --> 3230.16
climb people just expect you to talk on

3227.16 --> 3233.799
that standard level and I'm like just

3230.16 --> 3233.799
starting a conversation

3234.16 --> 3241.359
like where I basically connect open up

3238.16 --> 3244.52
to people with information level that

3241.359 --> 3248.2799999999997
people are just shocked by because

3244.52 --> 3250.52
usually like they can barely even have

3248.28 --> 3251.96
their own beloved family communicate

3250.52 --> 3254.04
that

3251.96 --> 3258.76
openly that

3254.04 --> 3258.7599999999998
honestly and I just do

3261.4 --> 3269.2400000000002
that because I don't fear being known

3266.839 --> 3272.5589999999997
I've like put the reverse system on that

3269.24 --> 3275.0
it's like no no no I'm I'm afraid not to

3272.559 --> 3277.079
be known because if I'm not known then

3275.0 --> 3278.16
I'll be misunderstood people will fill

3277.079 --> 3282.6800000000003
in the

3278.16 --> 3282.68
blanks and it's probably not going to be

3283.52 --> 3287.599
great so I have to make sure that people

3286.04 --> 3292.839
do actually know

3287.599 --> 3294.92
me I have to risk it I have to risk that

3292.839 --> 3298.72
confrontation that they'll know me for

3294.92 --> 3302.4
who who I am and then respond and and

3298.72 --> 3306.319
then yeah who knows what happens they

3302.4 --> 3308.64
might not like me they might be

3306.319 --> 3310.68
afraid right and it depends on the

3308.64 --> 3312.8799999999997
chemistry like what's the dynamic is the

3310.68 --> 3314.2
majority of a little group afraid or is

3312.88 --> 3316.599
it just one

3314.2 --> 3318.5589999999997
person like there's lots of people

3316.599 --> 3320.119
that'll just act in the group like

3318.559 --> 3322.44
they're not afraid but then when you're

3320.119 --> 3324.0
alone they're going to be like don't

3322.44 --> 3327.44
ever bring that up

3324.0 --> 3329.68
again they they were even afraid to to

3327.44 --> 3332.68
say that while in the

3329.68 --> 3332.68
group

3334.0 --> 3338.079
so because I'd just bring up

3347.559 --> 3351.2400000000002
everything oh okay Terra 306 yeah thanks

3350.2 --> 3354.0
for being

3351.24 --> 3357.0
there always good to have you

3354.0 --> 3357.0
around

3358.839 --> 3365.799
what Sy who is

3362.799 --> 3365.799
that

3368.76 --> 3374.88
Jesus the [ __ ] is that coming from M AAL

3372.0 --> 3374.88
what a dark

3383.92 --> 3386.92
story

3391.4 --> 3395.839
he calls Brian Cox Bryan's

3397.839 --> 3404.48
[ __ ] oh your dad calls it Kate's Bush

3402.039 --> 3404.48
yeah that's

3407.079 --> 3412.3590000000004
hilarious yeah maybe that's like I

3410.559 --> 3415.559
that's very typical by the way it's

3412.359 --> 3417.319
probably like a it

3415.559 --> 3422.52
she is a bit

3417.319 --> 3422.52
witchy but I I think in a way that I

3423.16 --> 3428.48
like

3425.92 --> 3432.4
so but I mean

3428.48 --> 3435.799
Bush for like a Dutch person person is

3432.4 --> 3437.92
really not so directly associated with

3435.799 --> 3441.24
female crotch area you

3437.92 --> 3443.64
know that so if we hear the word Bush

3441.24 --> 3446.799
it's like oh like a burning bush like a

3443.64 --> 3446.799
Shrubbery like

3448.079 --> 3454.44
so but I guess that in America and

3451.799 --> 3456.7599999999998
everybody immediately thinks about the

3454.44 --> 3456.76
other

3473.799 --> 3478.2
thing

3475.4 --> 3479.4
slow mentions yet oh okay I don't even

3478.2 --> 3481.799
know who that

3479.4 --> 3486.1600000000003
is yeah there's a lot of bands with a

3481.799 --> 3486.16
lot of super tragic things you know

3488.92 --> 3495.599
what I end up never liking

3492.68 --> 3498.5589999999997
them the ones that like completely [ __ ]

3495.599 --> 3502.2000000000003
up and they die or something

3498.559 --> 3503.7200000000003
and get they kill themselves like I

3502.2 --> 3506.72
don't like

3503.72 --> 3506.72
them

3506.8 --> 3509.9590000000003
[Music]

3510.559 --> 3517.76
like that did happen right let me check

3514.559 --> 3517.76
something before I bring it

3532.68 --> 3536.72
up is he still around

3539.44 --> 3547.76
yeah I knew it yeah the guy from The

3543.48 --> 3552.119
Prodigy right I when I was like in

3547.76 --> 3553.8390000000004
between 11 and 15 I was a huge fan of

3552.119 --> 3557.319
The

3553.839 --> 3561.7599999999998
Prodigy cuz that music was so

3557.319 --> 3564.119
good it's like from The Experience the J

3561.76 --> 3566.0
the generation and the fat of the land

3564.119 --> 3568.2400000000002
like that was like the bad jila

3566.0 --> 3571.48
Generations like one of the most amazing

3568.24 --> 3574.24
electronic musics I've ever heard at the

3571.48 --> 3577.2400000000002
time one of the best albums of the 90s

3574.24 --> 3581.359
in my opinion

3577.24 --> 3584.16
overall but yeah he killed himself like

3581.359 --> 3587.52
two two years ago and it's

3584.16 --> 3591.5589999999997
like what the [ __ ] happened

3587.52 --> 3596.119
man like because the last few CDs were

3591.559 --> 3599.7200000000003
not great at all it seemed like they The

3596.119 --> 3604.7200000000003
Prodigy had just signed onto the system

3599.72 --> 3605.8799999999997
right had become like one of those just

3604.72 --> 3609.319
like

3605.88 --> 3611.839
uh like Metallica hat you know like

3609.319 --> 3614.52
nobody really likes them

3611.839 --> 3615.96
anymore their old stuff is great and

3614.52 --> 3618.559
that sort of seemed to happen with the

3615.96 --> 3618.559
Prodigy

3620.4 --> 3626.559
and just like what the [ __ ]

3623.559 --> 3626.559
man

3640.68 --> 3643.839
but it's like

3646.44 --> 3651.039
yeah I'm just surprised like why would

3649.52 --> 3654.64
you do

3651.039 --> 3657.2400000000002
that when you have it's like don't you

3654.64 --> 3660.4
it's like the only thing if I were that

3657.24 --> 3663.4399999999996
guy and I'd be like I can't handle my

3660.4 --> 3665.799
life anymore just freaking listen to

3663.44 --> 3670.68
your own [ __ ] music

3665.799 --> 3673.52
dude listen to it how could you not want

3670.68 --> 3677.68
to restart at any

3673.52 --> 3681.559
age just listen to your old stuff try to

3677.68 --> 3684.7599999999998
recreate your old stuff the old level go

3681.559 --> 3686.3190000000004
in another like take it back and he

3684.76 --> 3689.76
could have done

3686.319 --> 3689.7599999999998
that but

3694.92 --> 3703.119
no Liam how made oh okay is that

3699.559 --> 3706.7200000000003
real I didn't know that M A thanks I

3703.119 --> 3706.7200000000003
guess I didn't

3706.96 --> 3710.92
yeah who the hell is Liam

3712.119 --> 3716.44
how oh the synthesizer guy

3726.799 --> 3732.319
right I I just don't get

3730.0 --> 3734.52
it what the hell are they why aren't

3732.319 --> 3736.7599999999998
they just going back I mean it's not

3734.52 --> 3741.2
even that difficult to go back it's just

3736.76 --> 3741.2000000000003
like dude Nostalgia big

3742.72 --> 3749.52
business why try to build something new

3745.64 --> 3752.8799999999997
when you got old great

3749.52 --> 3756.64
stuff why can't you expand on the old

3752.88 --> 3759.319
great stuff it's like a an interesting

3756.64 --> 3762.92
project could be well it's like yeah

3759.319 --> 3764.799
okay Spielberg did it or what you uh

3762.92 --> 3768.799
George Lucas did it with his Star Wars

3764.799 --> 3771.119
it's like you just make album one and a

3768.799 --> 3773.359
half of it you just go to the old style

3771.119 --> 3776.92
and then you're like okay now

3773.359 --> 3778.92
let's continue exactly that like what

3776.92 --> 3780.839
would be in line with that what could we

3778.92 --> 3785.279
make that could literally follow up that

3780.839 --> 3789.16
old CD so that would still be a

3785.279 --> 3791.839
unit so you continue making more songs

3789.16 --> 3794.48
in exactly that style with those sound

3791.839 --> 3798.7599999999998
effects and you do that with every good

3794.48 --> 3800.559
album dude you got a whole comeback if

3798.76 --> 3803.76
they done

3800.559 --> 3807.799
that but no they have to be more like a

3803.76 --> 3811.2000000000003
stage banned and [ __ ] and it's

3807.799 --> 3812.68
like they just I I got the feel that

3811.2 --> 3815.48
they were kind of getting jealous of

3812.68 --> 3815.48
rumstein or

3815.72 --> 3820.68
something don't you guys CU they were

3818.92 --> 3824.2000000000003
kind of put in the same

3820.68 --> 3827.799
basket eventually Prodigy when they

3824.2 --> 3831.0389999999998
became more famous and less

3827.799 --> 3831.0389999999998
good and

3832.559 --> 3838.079
Ramin I mean the fat of the the L had

3834.839 --> 3838.0789999999997
some really intense

3844.119 --> 3847.359
songs whole

3848.319 --> 3854.0
Century Music is a strong subject for

3851.279 --> 3856.559
yeah well for me too both my parents are

3854.0 --> 3859.48
music teachers

3856.559 --> 3864.76
were I've been drench the music it's

3859.48 --> 3868.52
just that I handle music like a f wine

3864.76 --> 3870.8390000000004
taster handles wine I don't make it I

3868.52 --> 3870.839
taste

3874.359 --> 3880.7599999999998
it if I'd make it myself I'd only ever

3878.16 --> 3883.0789999999997
disappoint myself that's what would

3880.76 --> 3883.079
always

3885.279 --> 3890.52
happen because I just can't stop being

3887.799 --> 3893.2
so serious about

3890.52 --> 3894.72
it and even when other people are just

3893.2 --> 3897.4399999999996
not very serious about I'm [ __ ]

3894.72 --> 3902.24
around with music that really annoys me

3897.44 --> 3905.0
you see I can't help it I just got these

3902.24 --> 3906.9599999999996
these this piece of my brain that I

3905.0 --> 3910.72
inherited from my mother where she just

3906.96 --> 3913.2400000000002
can have like Perfect music hearing just

3910.72 --> 3915.52
exactly figure out in one go what's what

3913.24 --> 3918.3999999999996
you're hearing like

3915.52 --> 3920.44
multiple tones at the same time like

3918.4 --> 3922.44
knowing what's going on like I have that

3920.44 --> 3924.76
too I didn't even really train it like

3922.44 --> 3926.319
she she like actively trained in her

3924.76 --> 3930.039
profession all the

3926.319 --> 3931.72
time but I just had a lot of great music

3930.039 --> 3934.88
to train on

3931.72 --> 3937.359
myself so I don't have like the academic

3934.88 --> 3941.52
references for what I'm hearing but I

3937.359 --> 3944.0389999999998
know the patterns oh do I know the

3941.52 --> 3947.68
patterns and I was even there like when

3944.039 --> 3950.6800000000003
my M when my mother was composing music

3947.68 --> 3952.72
with her piano step by step trying

3950.68 --> 3955.52
things out getting it wrong and then oh

3952.72 --> 3956.799
this is right this is right even like

3955.52 --> 3960.119
asking my

3956.799 --> 3963.279
opinion like I was there when that music

3960.119 --> 3966.319
was written that I uploaded on on my

3963.279 --> 3971.079
channel here my mother's

3966.319 --> 3973.799
music that video that's little guitar

3971.079 --> 3976.4
play my mother was I have the memories

3973.799 --> 3979.7599999999998
of my mother composing that while I was

3976.4 --> 3981.88
there on her

3979.76 --> 3984.6400000000003
piano pretty

3981.88 --> 3987.119
amazing and we also like

3984.64 --> 3990.52
together played it on the

3987.119 --> 3990.52
flute with the

3990.839 --> 3996.279
family that was really

3993.559 --> 3998.4
nice it's like one of the last really

3996.279 --> 4000.799
things that we would do

3998.4 --> 4003.6800000000003
together other than horse back riding

4000.799 --> 4006.72
which ended disastrously for my mother

4003.68 --> 4009.1189999999997
was playing the flute like my dad me and

4006.72 --> 4011.4399999999996
my mother my brother wasn't into

4009.119 --> 4013.6800000000003
it he was kind of out of the house at

4011.44 --> 4014.04
that time I don't know why what was he

4013.68 --> 4017.219
doing

4014.04 --> 4017.219
[Music]

4018.96 --> 4021.92
oh wait yeah he was

4022.839 --> 4028.799
studying went to the university and he

4025.279 --> 4031.799
was like living with my grandmother in

4028.799 --> 4031.799
Amsterdam

4042.92 --> 4047.6800000000003
yeah

4045.079 --> 4051.0
and my brother wasn't into that sort my

4047.68 --> 4051.0
brother actually got into

4051.2 --> 4058.52
drumming and also saxophone I think yeah

4056.24 --> 4060.68
I did I almost forgot that my brother

4058.52 --> 4063.92
actually learned to play

4060.68 --> 4067.2
saxophone pretty good at it too I mean

4063.92 --> 4070.44
not like whoa but like still like well

4067.2 --> 4070.4399999999996
not bad not bad at

4071.2 --> 4076.799
all and his drumming well

4074.48 --> 4079.4
I don't properly know I yeah I don't

4076.799 --> 4082.68
know how good he was at

4079.4 --> 4082.6800000000003
drumming it's

4082.799 --> 4087.839
like I was just very impressed I like I

4085.92 --> 4091.16
don't know how to

4087.839 --> 4094.2
drum maybe I could but it's like

4091.16 --> 4094.2
drumming is weird to

4094.52 --> 4101.52
me like I like to drum like with my with

4098.4 --> 4106.879999999999
my hands or something right over my

4101.52 --> 4106.88
feet I do like having a just ah I don't

4109.719 --> 4116.4
know it's like if I really wanted to

4112.839 --> 4118.5599999999995
learn it and like had put time in the

4116.4 --> 4120.799
day to keep like I had a drum set I

4118.56 --> 4122.88
would keep training and I would have to

4120.799 --> 4124.759
train for something like hey I'm going

4122.88 --> 4128.6
to join a band or something I really

4124.759 --> 4132.52
want to be a drummer then yeah I could

4128.6 --> 4134.96
definitely learn it although yeah I

4132.52 --> 4136.679
wonder like if my body still at this age

4134.96 --> 4139.4800000000005
would be able to take it or that I would

4136.679 --> 4142.719
just like get cramps and [ __ ] cuz

4139.48 --> 4142.718999999999
drumming can be very

4144.199 --> 4150.04
intense especially if you don't do it

4147.239 --> 4150.04
just for a short

4150.48 --> 4154.239
time

4152.34 --> 4158.96
[Music]

4154.239 --> 4162.0
anyway my music really is my my musical

4158.96 --> 4164.679
instrument is just my voice it

4162.0 --> 4168.319
is I can flu

4164.679 --> 4172.359
very well at a wide range of tones and

4168.319 --> 4175.080000000001
my and my voice it has an extreme range

4172.359 --> 4176.96
for this for a guy that smokes okay I

4175.08 --> 4180.159
smoke and I have this voice range it's

4176.96 --> 4184.96
crazy it's

4180.159 --> 4189.879999999999
crazy it's crazy how high I can

4184.96 --> 4192.08
go or just go all the way down no isue

4189.88 --> 4192.08
at

4192.719 --> 4195.719
all

4200.96 --> 4207.159
and I I do know how to I can

4204.28 --> 4209.92
sing it's just

4207.159 --> 4212.48
that I it makes me feel like a

4209.92 --> 4214.76
bird and then it's like if somebody

4212.48 --> 4217.718999999999
looks at a bird while they're singing

4214.76 --> 4217.719
and they notice they're

4218.96 --> 4224.56
like they get distracted but I have that

4221.56 --> 4227.56
too like I wouldn't be a great stage

4224.56 --> 4227.56
singer

4232.8 --> 4237.28
probably but who knows if I really

4235.199 --> 4240.12
thought that it was that then I probably

4237.28 --> 4242.759999999999
could I

4240.12 --> 4247.0
just I'm already like talking and

4242.76 --> 4247.0
throwing out my life on

4252.64 --> 4255.64
camera

4256.36 --> 4260.5599999999995
but I mean if I just end up

4258.159 --> 4262.48
spontaneously singing or something like

4260.56 --> 4264.679
it then it just happens and I'm glad

4262.48 --> 4267.12
when it happens it's just I don't want

4264.679 --> 4269.88
it to be like a conscious thing it's

4267.12 --> 4271.48
just if it happens it happens if I feel

4269.88 --> 4273.96
like it the conditions are right then I

4271.48 --> 4277.0
will just do it and it will just be like

4273.96 --> 4280.679
a a great song out of nowhere like I was

4277.0 --> 4283.239
always doing that that's how I like it

4280.679 --> 4286.52
if it's like becoming something that I I

4283.239 --> 4287.44
feel is expected of me then it's going

4286.52 --> 4290.2390000000005
to

4287.44 --> 4292.96
suck I just want my singing and all that

4290.239 --> 4292.959999999999
to just be

4293.32 --> 4298.0
spontaneous so that I don't think of

4295.96 --> 4300.76
myself as being a

4298.0 --> 4303.639
singer with what I do I don't want that

4300.76 --> 4303.639
I just want it to be

4309.84 --> 4315.56
spontaneous flat earth singing

4312.56 --> 4315.56
bird

4324.36 --> 4331.08
yeah like for example that in the in The

4328.159 --> 4334.199
Hobbit movie right the dwarf singing

4331.08 --> 4337.92
that was freaking awesome

4334.199 --> 4340.48
man like I can sing like that too and

4337.92 --> 4344.08
like when I heard that it's like

4340.48 --> 4345.4
oo you just like I I pull off it's like

4344.08 --> 4347.44
pulling it's like oh they're singing

4345.4 --> 4349.839999999999
pull up a chair Go sing along with it

4347.44 --> 4351.678999999999
and it's just I have this weird thing

4349.84 --> 4355.2390000000005
where basically I can sing along with a

4351.679 --> 4358.8
song that I've literally never heard

4355.239 --> 4361.48
before I I don't know how I do it but I

4358.8 --> 4363.400000000001
can it's like I guess how the song is

4361.48 --> 4365.678999999999
going to go and I'm really good at

4363.4 --> 4368.36
guessing even when I absolutely have

4365.679 --> 4371.36
never heard of it before because music

4368.36 --> 4373.12
is just naturally designed in a way

4371.36 --> 4374.639
there's routes you can take that make

4373.12 --> 4377.239
sense and there's route that you can

4374.639 --> 4379.4400000000005
take that don't make sense unless

4377.239 --> 4382.32
there's a wider context a wider reason a

4379.44 --> 4386.159
bigger plan of what's playing out and

4382.32 --> 4388.239
these patterns are all very logical and

4386.159 --> 4391.638999999999
similar even though they're kind of

4388.239 --> 4393.718999999999
ethereal Asic I'm just describing them

4391.639 --> 4397.76
now but there's no

4393.719 --> 4400.639
real official designation for that it's

4397.76 --> 4402.360000000001
just like the the construction process

4400.639 --> 4405.4800000000005
the feel of

4402.36 --> 4407.639
music compos composers just do it and

4405.48 --> 4410.759999999999
then they might have a story afterward

4407.639 --> 4413.32
as to what it is representing but I

4410.76 --> 4414.639
mean I think a lot of times just made up

4413.32 --> 4416.84
[ __ ] what they say about it

4414.639 --> 4420.32
afterward if they even like waste their

4416.84 --> 4423.1990000000005
time doing that or they like use it to

4420.32 --> 4426.159
to to do virtual signaling or something

4423.199 --> 4430.32
but the actual Music Creation process is

4426.159 --> 4433.879999999999
highly ethereal and is magical in my

4430.32 --> 4436.44
opinion like something really

4433.88 --> 4436.4400000000005
magical

4440.4 --> 4447.28
happens and so did my mother my mother

4442.92 --> 4447.28
literally believed that Ma music was

4447.8 --> 4452.92
magical she thought of herself as like

4450.52 --> 4452.92
being a

4454.199 --> 4461.199
Bard a music

4457.32 --> 4461.199
magician into music

4462.28 --> 4467.639
Magic

4464.44 --> 4470.32
but not like oh occult music stuff like

4467.639 --> 4473.36
o special instrumentals like oh sounds

4470.32 --> 4476.08
so ancient oh the ritual like not that

4473.36 --> 4477.639
kind of that's that was my thing I like

4476.08 --> 4479.679
that [ __ ] I thought that was fascinating

4477.639 --> 4483.2390000000005
my mother was just into like

4479.679 --> 4486.0
brilliant complex musical

4483.239 --> 4490.12
composition which would be found in

4486.0 --> 4494.32
Miles Davis right and in Prince and in

4490.12 --> 4498.48
sting and so if they were brilliantly

4494.32 --> 4498.48
composed my mother would be a fan of

4499.76 --> 4505.360000000001
them and be fascinated and and like try

4503.04 --> 4507.6
out to see if she could assimilate some

4505.36 --> 4509.759999999999
of it its power and do a little thing

4507.6 --> 4509.76
with

4512.08 --> 4522.199
it your background Arwin trolls can piss

4516.84 --> 4525.1990000000005
off what where I don't see

4522.199 --> 4525.199
any

4526.92 --> 4529.36
where are

4531.92 --> 4537.04
they all seems pretty amical in my chat

4534.84 --> 4537.04
right

4543.08 --> 4546.96
now you're being attacked on your

4545.4 --> 4552.199
channel

4546.96 --> 4555.199
what was my mom into the band Yes

4552.199 --> 4555.199
no

4562.4 --> 4565.44
at least I don't think

4565.88 --> 4572.719
so your paintings suck

4569.84 --> 4577.28
apparently they're just jealous

4572.719 --> 4581.0
dude I mean fiber outs listen carefully

4577.28 --> 4584.239
personally I'm not a fan of like uh

4581.0 --> 4586.199
Modern Art of like

4584.239 --> 4587.638999999999
uh what do you call that nonform based

4586.199 --> 4590.04
art where you're basically not

4587.639 --> 4592.679
representing something physical but

4590.04 --> 4594.239
you're just having patterns I'm normally

4592.679 --> 4598.4400000000005
not a fan of

4594.239 --> 4601.799999999999
that your stuff is really interesting

4598.44 --> 4604.879999999999
despite being that you there's something

4601.8 --> 4607.56
you make things in a fascinating way so

4604.88 --> 4610.96
[ __ ] them you're

4607.56 --> 4614.56
great which is like that's

4610.96 --> 4616.679
pretty special

4614.56 --> 4619.360000000001
most people that kind of go in the

4616.679 --> 4621.92
direction that you do with art I find

4619.36 --> 4623.839999999999
kind of tedious your stuff is like

4621.92 --> 4625.8
surprisingly

4623.84 --> 4628.719
interesting you're not touching you at

4625.8 --> 4632.4800000000005
all great it shouldn't cuz you're you're

4628.719 --> 4632.4800000000005
you're very talented and what you

4634.8 --> 4638.360000000001
do they're just

4642.0 --> 4645.0
jealous

4649.56 --> 4655.52
you're jealous

4651.6 --> 4659.360000000001
yeah well I used to paint a

4655.52 --> 4663.1990000000005
bit and I got some cool stuff out of it

4659.36 --> 4664.96
but I'm not that good it's like painting

4663.199 --> 4666.719
has never been like a skill where I'm

4664.96 --> 4669.96
like yeah I'm going to expand on that

4666.719 --> 4673.96
because I'm good it's like no I'm

4669.96 --> 4675.88
just I'm just sufficient sufficient

4673.96 --> 4678.6
enough that I'm not going to be fully

4675.88 --> 4680.04
embarrassed about it but I'm not that

4678.6 --> 4683.360000000001
great and that's why I'm not really

4680.04 --> 4687.679
progressing Beyond basic sketching it's

4683.36 --> 4691.08
just I haven't been able to deepen to to

4687.679 --> 4693.96
create to draw with more depth it's just

4691.08 --> 4696.04
not working out for me I'm not digging

4693.96 --> 4699.199
in the drawing depth I'm

4696.04 --> 4701.92
digging in the esoteric inside depth

4699.199 --> 4705.199
that's where I'm digging

4701.92 --> 4707.28
now and it digging deep deeper than I

4705.199 --> 4709.919999999999
ever have I understand more things than

4707.28 --> 4712.28
I ever thought I would be able to and

4709.92 --> 4714.2390000000005
that's part of the thing too is that now

4712.28 --> 4718.48
I'm in a period where I'm

4714.239 --> 4720.959999999999
like I used to think that there would be

4718.48 --> 4722.4
these things that I would just be

4720.96 --> 4724.6
staring me in the face that I would

4722.4 --> 4726.96
never be able to figure

4724.6 --> 4731.679
out I was

4726.96 --> 4734.4800000000005
wrong I no longer believe that there

4731.679 --> 4736.0
is any anything that just cannot be

4734.48 --> 4738.879999999999
understand understood I just don't

4736.0 --> 4740.639
believe it anymore I think everything

4738.88 --> 4744.0
can it's just you have to there's

4740.639 --> 4746.679
certain things about it that you have to

4744.0 --> 4749.159
accept it's all about can you let go of

4746.679 --> 4752.52
your preconceptions to let in something

4749.159 --> 4753.679
more real that's more durable with more

4752.52 --> 4756.52
fractal

4753.679 --> 4759.52
depth that will be more that will ring

4756.52 --> 4759.52
more true over

4761.84 --> 4764.84
time

4783.6 --> 4788.0
right but I mean a lot of trolls out

4785.84 --> 4790.12
there now they will find anything to

4788.0 --> 4793.44
just [ __ ] on

4790.12 --> 4796.88
because they got like some

4793.44 --> 4799.08
AI painting machine thing right and it's

4796.88 --> 4800.96
like oh I just typed this in and I got a

4799.08 --> 4803.36
gigantic piece of

4800.96 --> 4806.04
art you're just

4803.36 --> 4808.28
stupid that's how they think

4806.04 --> 4810.96
now cuz they're idiots and they're

4808.28 --> 4814.0
really [ __ ] lazy and they don't even

4810.96 --> 4817.639
understand that the AI they're using to

4814.0 --> 4820.92
assem to assemble this painting at a

4817.639 --> 4824.76
moment's notice is all derived from

4820.92 --> 4824.76
actual artists work

4826.92 --> 4830.639
cuz they're just [ __ ]

4830.76 --> 4837.2390000000005
[ __ ] they're like complete morons

4833.84 --> 4841.32
that just get powers of

4837.239 --> 4843.36
Kings like yeah you you just had a an

4841.32 --> 4847.639
art assembly machine but you're a

4843.36 --> 4850.12
[ __ ] [ __ ] so oh I am better than

4847.639 --> 4852.32
everybody now and all the people that

4850.12 --> 4854.679
actually make the art are stupid because

4852.32 --> 4857.759999999999
you could just type in a sentence and

4854.679 --> 4861.04
have art

4857.76 --> 4864.679
yeah idiots getting the power of

4861.04 --> 4864.679
Kings that's what that

4866.56 --> 4872.4400000000005
is and that's what a lot of trolls are

4869.0 --> 4874.52
arrogant retards people that found a a

4872.44 --> 4877.0
piece of power that's way that's

4874.52 --> 4879.88
outrageous

4877.0 --> 4881.88
basically and then think that they're

4879.88 --> 4884.639
better than everybody else that's what

4881.88 --> 4884.639
happens

4896.199 --> 4903.44
you all regulars are in those paintings

4899.08 --> 4903.44
what oh

4903.84 --> 4907.4400000000005
wow that's really

4908.28 --> 4914.96
amazing I didn't know that your painting

4911.32 --> 4916.96
was like directly grafting in the spirit

4914.96 --> 4920.4800000000005
of of our

4916.96 --> 4920.4800000000005
group that's really

4941.56 --> 4944.679
amazing

4943.04 --> 4949.4
[Music]

4944.679 --> 4953.84
it's cooling off a bit it's not very

4949.4 --> 4957.96
off magp just found out about the fresh

4953.84 --> 4959.679
water let's see what he going to

4957.96 --> 4962.679
do

4959.679 --> 4962.679
nothing

4963.56 --> 4971.04
oh never

4966.08 --> 4971.04
mind that's an rwi painting

4971.159 --> 4974.5599999999995
what really

4976.239 --> 4978.44
hold

4986.0 --> 4991.0
on

4987.76 --> 4993.320000000001
where is that on your channel VI Roos

4991.0 --> 4993.32
let me

4999.199 --> 5004.48
check

5001.48 --> 5004.48
whoa

5019.199 --> 5025.239
that thing almost looked

5020.96 --> 5030.28
just it's so bizarre how you made

5025.239 --> 5030.28
that because it reminds me of so many

5031.48 --> 5036.199
things

5033.08 --> 5039.4
of different styles it's like it's

5036.199 --> 5039.4
almost a bit of fang

5040.84 --> 5049.32
goog but

5043.719 --> 5049.32
like like if Fang go got like really

5049.84 --> 5056.08
high like because he already had like

5053.28 --> 5059.08
this weird look on things but then like

5056.08 --> 5063.48
it like he's really tripping and it's

5059.08 --> 5066.159
like he just sees this as ceric

5063.48 --> 5069.5199999999995
representation

5066.159 --> 5072.44
instead and it is

5069.52 --> 5076.040000000001
so there's like it's like it's a natural

5072.44 --> 5076.04
structure almost like

5076.8 --> 5080.28
a amazing

5085.239 --> 5093.91
stuff talking about this one of

5089.0 --> 5097.029
course you are a unicorn fiber okay

5093.91 --> 5097.0289999999995
[Music]

5104.36 --> 5107.36
gosh

5121.28 --> 5124.28
okay

5151.28 --> 5156.639
wow

5152.96 --> 5156.639
yeah that kinas is like

5157.119 --> 5162.639
Prismatic to be fair that thing kind of

5159.52 --> 5164.92
like looks like a giant

5162.639 --> 5168.04
hallucination

5164.92 --> 5171.679
astounding is that like a big

5168.04 --> 5171.679
dragon is that what I'm

5174.8 --> 5177.8
seeing

5181.199 --> 5184.199
huh

5189.159 --> 5194.25
yeah I'll post the link don't

5191.15 --> 5194.25
[Music]

5195.639 --> 5199.719
worry this is

5211.199 --> 5214.199
Cushy

5230.08 --> 5235.88
yeah good stuff by

5232.119 --> 5236.639
roads really glad I'm uh I'm inspiring

5235.88 --> 5240.96
all

5236.639 --> 5240.96
that because it's very interesting

5241.119 --> 5244.119
stuff

5254.28 --> 5258.08
no I get it I get

5256.86 --> 5261.28
[Music]

5258.08 --> 5264.5599999999995
it art has its own

5261.28 --> 5268.84
pace it doesn't really abide by the

5264.56 --> 5268.84
normal experience of linear

5271.119 --> 5274.119
time

5275.48 --> 5282.159
my experience real art is you get the

5279.4 --> 5285.119
vision you start to make

5282.159 --> 5288.599999999999
it and then over the time that you make

5285.119 --> 5292.04
it you gain

5288.6 --> 5295.360000000001
alterations and that's what

5292.04 --> 5297.92
happens but you start out with a whole

5295.36 --> 5300.119
picture and then parts of it are still

5297.92 --> 5302.679
ethereal and then as you go yeah

5300.119 --> 5304.799999999999
suddenly it might manifest

5302.679 --> 5307.119
differently and then you are able to

5304.8 --> 5307.119000000001
finish

5311.28 --> 5317.92
it take a long look in the

5314.52 --> 5317.92
mirror I doubt

5324.0 --> 5330.679
it museum of modern

5327.08 --> 5332.5199999999995
AR no dude you should come over here in

5330.679 --> 5336.04
the Netherlands and check out like the

5332.52 --> 5336.040000000001
fog Museum

5343.6 --> 5349.280000000001
seriously like it is very

5346.679 --> 5352.56
special I've been there it is it is

5349.28 --> 5357.32
interesting and it is close to your

5352.56 --> 5360.4400000000005
style are wind be as well several times

5357.32 --> 5364.4
what the M yeah I've never been in New

5360.44 --> 5364.4
York low fruit I don't know what talking

5370.84 --> 5375.88
about oh in

5373.239 --> 5378.638999999999
Amsterdam oh yeah then I guess I I've

5375.88 --> 5381.119
been there

5378.639 --> 5384.2390000000005
sure there are several museums in

5381.119 --> 5387.4
Amsterdam and like in my early 20s I

5384.239 --> 5390.44
went there several times because it's

5387.4 --> 5393.44
like part of my art education I was

5390.44 --> 5396.04
trying to get into an art

5393.44 --> 5396.04
school

5400.679 --> 5406.92
thing I painted some stuff it was not

5407.08 --> 5411.92
super so I eventually kind of stopped

5414.239 --> 5419.678999999999
it the first art project I did after

5417.76 --> 5421.56
that was basically my Dungeons and

5419.679 --> 5424.76
Dragons works that's when I started to

5421.56 --> 5426.360000000001
pick creativity back up although no to

5424.76 --> 5428.639
be fair that's not true because of

5426.36 --> 5432.599999999999
course I did gold

5428.639 --> 5435.08
smithing I transition from painting to

5432.6 --> 5438.08
goldsmithing I was in the middle of my

5435.08 --> 5442.88
painting phase talking

5438.08 --> 5445.5599999999995
like between 19 and

5442.88 --> 5449.04
23 and it's also the time where my

5445.56 --> 5449.04
parents like got

5450.84 --> 5453.84
divorced

5456.719 --> 5461.84
and then after that I started to get

5459.44 --> 5464.28
interested in Gold smithing and I I

5461.84 --> 5467.360000000001
started interested in that because my

5464.28 --> 5467.36
dad used to do

5467.719 --> 5474.96
that this is interesting yeah he used to

5471.159 --> 5476.96
like uh make little standards for an art

5474.96 --> 5479.32
museum that was like the

5476.96 --> 5481.96
neighbors African art by the way for

5479.32 --> 5483.719
like African statues well he used to

5481.96 --> 5485.4
make like the standards for those things

5483.719 --> 5488.639
very good at it

5485.4 --> 5490.4
too so I just got interested I thought

5488.639 --> 5492.6
like yeah maybe that's something I and

5490.4 --> 5495.119
my dad was actually willing to teach me

5492.6 --> 5497.8
right that's the whole thing it's like

5495.119 --> 5500.759999999999
wow if somebody's actually interested in

5497.8 --> 5503.1990000000005
teaching me yet then I will absolutely

5500.76 --> 5503.1990000000005
Master

5503.28 --> 5507.679
it trying to find somebody that's

5505.8 --> 5510.76
interested in teaching you something has

5507.679 --> 5513.76
been the problem all my

5510.76 --> 5513.76
life

5516.88 --> 5522.119
but yeah my dad basically helped me get

5519.92 --> 5526.2390000000005
into gold smithing the disciplines there

5522.119 --> 5528.08
and like sawing metal

5526.239 --> 5531.44
plates

5528.08 --> 5533.96
basic things like soldering but I never

5531.44 --> 5537.04
really got to that and then I went

5533.96 --> 5539.28
to Gold smithing school and then I

5537.04 --> 5543.679
learned it I basically went to the

5539.28 --> 5543.679
goldsmithing school to learn soldering

5548.08 --> 5554.199
because like making shapes cutting

5550.6 --> 5557.2390000000005
shapes like I had all A+ on that [ __ ]

5554.199 --> 5562.04
cuz I'm really good at

5557.239 --> 5565.199
it hey dude I made this yeah this is all

5562.04 --> 5568.159
handson okay

5565.199 --> 5572.599999999999
handon

5568.159 --> 5578.36
okay one go no machine machine no

5572.6 --> 5578.360000000001
machine involved hands on one go that's

5578.639 --> 5582.2390000000005
me I'm good at

5590.4 --> 5594.4
it good at small

5596.719 --> 5604.28
too like I would for that one I used

5600.08 --> 5607.0
saws that were so small you just had

5604.28 --> 5608.8
when I was busy I just have to do like

5607.0 --> 5613.76
and it would immediately

5608.8 --> 5617.119000000001
break there it goes cuz it was so

5613.76 --> 5618.8
mini but I could do it it was tedious

5617.119 --> 5624.44
but very worth

5618.8 --> 5624.4400000000005
it even though I broke like five of

5628.199 --> 5633.48
them but yeah how how else are you going

5631.04 --> 5638.119
to make

5633.48 --> 5641.32
specific shaped holes that are that

5638.119 --> 5647.199
small like the only way to do

5641.32 --> 5650.639
it is with do you see that the tiny

5647.199 --> 5653.839999999999
ones like the camera can barely even

5650.639 --> 5653.84
sharpen damn

5655.4 --> 5660.36
it Focus damn it Focus come

5660.48 --> 5663.48
on

5665.639 --> 5672.159000000001
Focus ah

5668.719 --> 5674.36
whatever up a

5672.159 --> 5677.36
bit does that

5674.36 --> 5680.92
help right see that ah the light see

5677.36 --> 5683.48
there's tiny tiny little holes yeah

5680.92 --> 5685.76
those are s that's not just a round

5683.48 --> 5688.718999999999
drill

5685.76 --> 5693.1990000000005
hole otherwise it would have looked

5688.719 --> 5696.56
sloppy like round drill holes

5693.199 --> 5700.5199999999995
I didn't do that I did a mini mini drill

5696.56 --> 5701.400000000001
hole the smallest drill I've ever seen

5700.52 --> 5705.639
it's

5701.4 --> 5709.04
like 1 mm drill or less than 1

5705.639 --> 5712.719
mm and then the rest with the tiniest

5709.04 --> 5712.719
string saw that I've ever

5715.32 --> 5719.08
used but it was well worth

5720.4 --> 5725.4
it

5723.32 --> 5726.679
the world's smallest perfectly cut

5725.4 --> 5729.679
diamond is in

5726.679 --> 5729.679
Amsterdam

5732.4 --> 5737.159
yes yeah there's a there's a big diamond

5735.96 --> 5741.52
IND

5737.159 --> 5744.599999999999
this yeah but it's great you you do you

5741.52 --> 5747.400000000001
you keep cutting those

5744.6 --> 5748.92
diamonds you got banned from fed again

5747.4 --> 5750.4
yeah but that's because you're acting

5748.92 --> 5753.4
like an idiot

5750.4 --> 5753.4
duper

5753.44 --> 5756.5599999999995
you were acting like

5761.639 --> 5769.6
chiky I even asked you like are you like

5765.159 --> 5772.679
ch's cousin or something but you denied

5769.6 --> 5775.76
it when I ask that that's an indication

5772.679 --> 5775.76
like you're getting

5778.76 --> 5785.52
annoying for stating your neutral

5782.44 --> 5785.5199999999995
no I doubt

5788.639 --> 5792.88
it it's proba well maybe it is for

5791.4 --> 5795.119
stating you're neutral because you're

5792.88 --> 5798.8
blatantly not

5795.119 --> 5802.28
neutral so it's that that would be a

5798.8 --> 5805.76
lie you probably were banned for lying

5802.28 --> 5808.8
duper cuz you're not

5805.76 --> 5811.360000000001
neutral I've seen you regurgitate anti

5808.8 --> 5812.84
Flat Earth sources for batim with

anything he's the guy that came on last

5867.08 --> 5873.199
that got banned from the from the

5869.4 --> 5873.199
Discord because he was

5874.76 --> 5882.52
lying that happened like two weeks ago

5878.48 --> 5882.5199999999995
or something two three weeks

5885.48 --> 5893.799999999999

5890.48 --> 5896.159

5893.8 --> 5896.159000000001
park

5900.119 --> 5903.119
thanks

5910.88 --> 5916.679
there's like endless amounts of other

5914.0 --> 5921.239
locations that are much better as a

5916.679 --> 5924.8
meeting place to meet then vul Park of

5921.239 --> 5927.879999999999
fruit but not being a Dutch person you

5924.8 --> 5927.88
probably don't know

5930.119 --> 5933.119
that

5933.29 --> 5936.43
[Music]

5936.44 --> 5941.638999999999
I mean you probably don't understand

5938.679 --> 5944.56
that around these parts or well it used

5941.639 --> 5947.4800000000005
to be that before the sjw Revolution

5944.56 --> 5950.679
crap and everything became gay here well

5947.48 --> 5953.598999999999
before that the vondo park was like the

5950.679 --> 5956.639
place where gays met so saying like oh

5953.599 --> 5958.92
let's meet at the vondo park it's like

5956.639 --> 5962.1990000000005
that's to us or that to me that's like

5958.92 --> 5965.96
let's meet at the gay bar well let's not

5962.199 --> 5965.96
meet at the gay bar how about

5966.4 --> 5971.239
that but you probably didn't know about

5969.48 --> 5974.598999999999
that because that's

5971.239 --> 5976.08
before before everything became gay here

5974.599 --> 5979.159000000001
so it's like people don't even know

5976.08 --> 5981.199
about that anymore I guess I will always

5979.159 --> 5984.48
remember that that like fulo park that's

5981.199 --> 5987.12
where the freaking gays always

5984.48 --> 5990.04
meet

5987.12 --> 5993.04
[Music]

5990.04 --> 5993.04
yo

6001.84 --> 6009.28
huh scrap the idea for sure that yeah

6005.88 --> 6012.84
now dude there's good places here to be

6009.28 --> 6015.84
the utra dude UT tracked nobody knows

6012.84 --> 6019.4400000000005
about it but it's amazing there's great

6015.84 --> 6021.56
places here there's like lots of Park

6019.44 --> 6025.199
like areas and

6021.56 --> 6027.080000000001
like we don't need to meet up with like

6025.199 --> 6029.159
50 people or something right we're going

6027.08 --> 6032.28
to probably it's going to be like 20

6029.159 --> 6035.96
people 30 maybe if we're lucky probably

6032.28 --> 6038.639
more 10 there's so many places here

6035.96 --> 6041.36
where it's great to hang

6038.639 --> 6044.639
around like hang around by the water

6041.36 --> 6044.639
with the grass plenty of

6048.639 --> 6052.92
trees it's great

6057.76 --> 6065.52
like there's a specific like sort of

6061.48 --> 6068.879999999999
place it's like a a big building with

6065.52 --> 6072.080000000001
a with an area yeah with a little grass

6068.88 --> 6072.08
field and

6072.28 --> 6080.44
some benches and stuff and tables like

6077.52 --> 6083.159000000001
that you can just hire for like an event

6080.44 --> 6083.96
it's right across the river from me

6083.159 --> 6087.4
right

6083.96 --> 6090.32
there I don't know how expensive that is

6087.4 --> 6092.799999999999
but if I'd ever like wanted to organize

6090.32 --> 6094.5199999999995
like sort of an early bird Meetup in the

6092.8 --> 6096.159000000001
Netherlands then that would probably be

6094.52 --> 6097.0
the place because it's literally right

6096.159 --> 6100.119
next

6097.0 --> 6103.719
door and that place is like you can

6100.119 --> 6106.598999999999
easily have 50 people in there and

6103.719 --> 6109.44
outside cuz it's all surrounded by water

6106.599 --> 6109.4400000000005
and trees and

6109.52 --> 6115.280000000001
stuff so that that would probably be the

6112.48 --> 6115.28
place I try

6123.679 --> 6130.119
that I kind of wanted to do that since

6126.56 --> 6134.679
20120 but then the whole lockdown [ __ ]

6130.119 --> 6134.679
happened and all that idea just like

6139.76 --> 6145.719
disappeared

6142.28 --> 6149.32
the drive a Porche on the green

6145.719 --> 6152.28
what okay

6149.32 --> 6155.28
M

6152.28 --> 6155.28
muser

6163.36 --> 6168.92

6165.92 --> 6168.92
called the AIDS

6169.76 --> 6172.76

6192.96 --> 6202.4
no by the way in general dating in a big

6199.52 --> 6206.159000000001
city I I don't know I don't know if

6202.4 --> 6209.719
that's such a good place to find a

6206.159 --> 6212.119
date unless you're just one sex or

6209.719 --> 6215.08
something in a one night stand then yeah

6212.119 --> 6215.08
I guess

6215.28 --> 6218.42
[Music]

6225.44 --> 6232.678999999999
gross if she showed up you would know

6228.719 --> 6232.679
you would she had a good sense

6234.32 --> 6242.199
yes I get it I was slow I was just

6239.159 --> 6243.839999999999
disturbingly taking it literal again I

6242.199 --> 6246.28
can't help it

6243.84 --> 6249.400000000001
guys it's

6246.28 --> 6251.92
like I suspect strongly you meant it as

6249.4 --> 6253.799999999999
a joke but I can't help but interpret it

6251.92 --> 6255.88
literally I just can't help

6253.8 --> 6259.28
myself and then I make it very

6255.88 --> 6259.28
complicated because of

6259.599 --> 6262.599
that

6280.76 --> 6285.360000000001
right

6281.679 --> 6289.159
anyway today I'm good I'm not going

6285.36 --> 6293.44
to yeah I promise not to complain about

6289.159 --> 6296.638999999999
mongy at all and I haven't and I want

6293.44 --> 6296.638999999999
cuz I'm all covered for

6297.32 --> 6303.159
now food

6299.92 --> 6304.4
smokes drinks Illuminati croissant

6303.159 --> 6307.4
everything I

6304.4 --> 6307.4
need

6308.92 --> 6315.119
woohoo now all I need is a nice wind but

6313.36 --> 6317.0
unfortunately you can't buy that in the

6315.119 --> 6320.719
store

6317.0 --> 6323.239
well cuz a fan is not the same thing as

6320.719 --> 6323.2390000000005
actual

6323.639 --> 6326.639
win

6337.0 --> 6342.199
well got a vague idea that I wasn't

6339.48 --> 6344.839999999999
going to like bring up

6342.199 --> 6347.759999999999
something but I mean the heat is making

6344.84 --> 6350.56
it difficult for me really it

6347.76 --> 6352.88
is I noticed that that with the heat it

6350.56 --> 6354.88
really makes it difficult to focus and

6352.88 --> 6356.599
if I like don't do anything if I

6354.88 --> 6359.2390000000005
basically don't talk and think all the

6356.599 --> 6361.8
time and don't get enthusiastic then I

6359.239 --> 6364.44
do cool off a

6361.8 --> 6365.639
lot and then it's very doable and then I

6364.44 --> 6370.199
clear

6365.639 --> 6373.08
up but yeah as I'm doing my show I am

6370.199 --> 6376.36
basically creating heat so

6373.08 --> 6379.08
that it just makes it more difficult to

6376.36 --> 6379.08
to go on

6379.4 --> 6387.799999999999
a on a roll without

6384.239 --> 6392.48
overheating keep sweating just it won't

6387.8 --> 6392.4800000000005
stop I'm going to get the pan thing

6395.84 --> 6402.400000000001
again so yeah even though I loving this

6398.8 --> 6406.76
heat I also secretly can't wait until

6402.4 --> 6410.4
it's over again and I can just like get

6406.76 --> 6414.76
enthusiastic and moving without then get

6410.4 --> 6414.759999999999
getting all sweaty like a pig or a

6423.21 --> 6428.84
[Applause]

hippo oh is

6439.32 --> 6444.159
nice

6441.639 --> 6447.52
noisy but

6444.159 --> 6447.5199999999995
great Dirt

6447.92 --> 6457.96
Cheap like this is a USB stick fan you

6453.36 --> 6457.96
could put this in your laptop it's

6460.84 --> 6466.76
hilarious so that even when the power

6463.52 --> 6471.400000000001
goes out as long as your laptop has a

6466.76 --> 6474.56
battery you can still have a fan

6471.4 --> 6477.199
blow on you when it's super hot so

6474.56 --> 6478.96
that's actually a really potentially

6477.199 --> 6481.199
precious tool if you're going to like

6478.96 --> 6483.32
super hot

6481.199 --> 6485.48
areas because you could stick it in your

6483.32 --> 6489.639
laptop and like even if there's no power

6485.48 --> 6489.638999999999
you'll still have a fan emergency

6497.199 --> 6501.919999999999
fan you take your information from

6499.76 --> 6503.0
Google it's tends to be Pro Globe where

6501.92 --> 6504.679
else I'm I supposed to get the

6503.0 --> 6506.159
information from you don't have to get

6504.679 --> 6507.4400000000005
the information somewhere else you just

6506.159 --> 6510.28
have to be

6507.44 --> 6511.799999999999
capable of

6510.28 --> 6513.5199999999995
discerning

6511.8 --> 6518.2390000000005
actual

6513.52 --> 6520.4800000000005
provable real information from

6518.239 --> 6522.959999999999
conceptual Globe

6520.48 --> 6525.239
minations you have to be able to discern

6522.96 --> 6528.92
the difference right like I'm going to

6525.239 --> 6531.199
look up the coris effect right in

6528.92 --> 6533.56
Wikipedia because because it does

6531.199 --> 6537.119
actually contain the accurate

6533.56 --> 6540.92
information as what Coralis effect is it

6537.119 --> 6543.0
also however has this huge trunk of

6540.92 --> 6545.4400000000005
Globus

6543.0 --> 6548.32
nonsense where first they claim yeah

6545.44 --> 6552.32
it's it's an a non-actual

6548.32 --> 6555.159
deviation perceived from a from a a

6552.32 --> 6557.0
moving reference frame right cess

6555.159 --> 6559.239
deviation not actual deviation you're

6557.0 --> 6560.84
the one deviating and then they proceed

6559.239 --> 6565.44
to say oh but it's

6560.84 --> 6568.360000000001
also things actually moving because of

6565.44 --> 6571.638999999999
earth spin and that has nothing that

6568.36 --> 6574.0
literally contradicts Corola effect it

6571.639 --> 6575.92
contradicts it suddenly it is a real

6574.0 --> 6578.84
deviation now according to that and

6575.92 --> 6582.4
that's just logically

6578.84 --> 6586.96
incorrect you as an individual should

6582.4 --> 6589.4
become capable of seeing that so that

6586.96 --> 6593.28
when you attain information from a

6589.4 --> 6596.0
source that you can distinguish what

6593.28 --> 6599.199
within the information source is correct

6596.0 --> 6599.199
and what is

6599.76 --> 6605.360000000001
incorrect you can never just take a

6602.76 --> 6608.08
piece of information as true for batim

6605.36 --> 6610.88
you always have to analyze what is in

6608.08 --> 6613.639
there

6610.88 --> 6616.639
because people get it

6613.639 --> 6616.639
wrong

6617.8 --> 6622.76
everywhere misinformation is fair very

6623.599 --> 6628.400000000001
tenacious like even if it is proven

6625.88 --> 6629.36
wrong it's still going to be popularized

6628.4 --> 6634.96
it's going to

6629.36 --> 6637.96
be put back in this what what they

6634.96 --> 6637.96
do

6649.04 --> 6652.04
duper

6660.88 --> 6665.36
what really o that's

6665.84 --> 6670.4800000000005
hilarious Morocco got hit by a big Quake

6668.679 --> 6672.679
what

6670.48 --> 6674.629999999999
really

6672.679 --> 6677.72
[ __ ] that's not

6708.96 --> 6711.96
massive

6717.119 --> 6720.839999999999

6719.44 --> 6723.119
with

6720.84 --> 6727.32
turkey is

6723.119 --> 6729.88
it because there was this like gigantic

6727.32 --> 6732.48
earthquake Series in in turkey that was

6729.88 --> 6734.76
very unnatural the way that it

6732.48 --> 6736.598999999999
manifested I wonder if this is like a

6734.76 --> 6738.88
continuation of that or if this is

6736.599 --> 6743.56
actually provably

6738.88 --> 6746.28
natural it is a earthquake risk area it

6743.56 --> 6749.639
is it is recognized as such but still

they can count it that quickly no no you

6805.88 --> 6810.639
can't know how many are that that

then

6865.92 --> 6869.719
okay so last

6870.199 --> 6875.159
night that happened okay yeah if it's

6872.84 --> 6879.119000000001
like more than 12 hours later then they

6875.159 --> 6879.119
can definitely have a proper death

6888.28 --> 6894.199
count yeah yeah the story yeah I I get

6890.92 --> 6897.76
that now parallel

6894.199 --> 6900.759999999999
parsnips yeah

6897.76 --> 6900.76
right

6909.92 --> 6914.639
man hey Supreme knowing good to see

6918.599 --> 6921.599
you

6922.11 --> 6927.839999999999
[Music]

6929.89 --> 6934.229
[Music]

6948.599 --> 6951.599
e

6953.18 --> 6958.229
[Applause]

6955.08 --> 6958.229
[Music]

6964.25 --> 6968.52
[Music]

6966.4 --> 6971.36
right so

6968.52 --> 6973.2390000000005
yeah all that I'm really worried about

6971.36 --> 6977.079
these days is like with any freaking

6973.239 --> 6979.159
disaster it is going to be does that

6977.079 --> 6980.759999999999
mean that black rock Vanguard is going

6979.159 --> 6983.839999999999
to buy it up

6980.76 --> 6986.76
now like that's really the only question

6983.84 --> 6991.32
that immediately pops up after any

6986.76 --> 6994.599
disaster anywhere in the world it's like

6991.32 --> 6994.599
are they going to buy it up

7008.48 --> 7011.48
now

7019.36 --> 7024.88
can't have been last night either uh

7021.76 --> 7024.88
that's what it says

7025.92 --> 7029.159
though M

7037.84 --> 7046.2390000000005
AAL it says here the Quake hit just

7042.04 --> 7048.32
after 11:00 p.m. local time in Morocco

7046.239 --> 7051.5599999999995
just roughly the same time is the

7048.32 --> 7055.44
Netherland maybe a few hours off one or

7051.56 --> 7055.4400000000005
two 22

7055.48 --> 7059.04
GTM that's what it

7068.4 --> 7071.4
says

7078.599 --> 7083.56
Bobby steals he's a [ __ ]

7085.119 --> 7091.709
scumbag he is forever

7088.67 --> 7091.709
[Music]

7098.32 --> 7101.32
been

7101.67 --> 7105.01
[Music]

7108.239 --> 7118.5199999999995
CERN might be used to no never dupons

7112.719 --> 7118.52
never CERN does have any influence on

7118.599 --> 7123.639
earthquakes it's not what they use they

7120.88 --> 7126.52
have like

7123.639 --> 7128.32
Declassified super heavy effective

7126.52 --> 7131.320000000001
earthquake

7128.32 --> 7131.32
weapons

7134.239 --> 7138.0
Declassified earlier this

7150.639 --> 7157.56
year like CERN doesn't do anything

7153.56 --> 7157.56
except draw in a huge amount of

7158.239 --> 7161.239
money

7163.119 --> 7168.839999999999
and create a lot of conspiracy

7165.199 --> 7168.839999999999
theorizing with no real

7178.679 --> 7183.679
leads I mean CERN is literally like a a

7182.48 --> 7186.5199999999995
witches

7183.679 --> 7189.2390000000005
cauldron that is just being used to make

7186.52 --> 7192.639
people fantasize about how some

7189.239 --> 7195.32
something magical I mean just the amount

7192.639 --> 7198.52
of movies by now that literally just

7195.32 --> 7201.599
suggest in some sci-fi plot that a

7198.52 --> 7205.88
cyclotron or a headon collider literally

7201.599 --> 7208.04
will cause a gate to another dimension I

7205.88 --> 7210.76
mean it's getting kind of old by now

7208.04 --> 7212.36
like that's what it's for it's just a a

7210.76 --> 7215.119000000001
witch's

7212.36 --> 7218.199
cauldron for people to get all

7215.119 --> 7221.48
Fantastical spooky about it that's what

7218.199 --> 7225.079
it exists for

7221.48 --> 7227.28
publicly to be suspicious and to give

7225.079 --> 7229.799999999999
people science fiction imaginations

7227.28 --> 7236.0
about creating black holes consuming the

7229.8 --> 7239.8
entire world and more witchcraft

7236.0 --> 7244.079
nonsense that's what it's

7239.8 --> 7245.76
for it's not a side effect it is the

7244.079 --> 7248.119
reason it

7245.76 --> 7251.119000000001
exists for

7248.119 --> 7251.119
that

7255.04 --> 7260.96
now it does make sense they would build

7257.199 --> 7260.96
something that large for for that

7261.119 --> 7265.199
reason first off because they

7265.719 --> 7274.0
can and second because well this the

7269.4 --> 7274.0
scale of it freaks people

7274.719 --> 7279.719
out it's a witches cauldron nobody

7278.0 --> 7282.28
understands it but every body thinks it

7279.719 --> 7284.76
will do something it's so big how can it

7282.28 --> 7284.759999999999
not do

7307.719 --> 7312.8
something I mean

7310.56 --> 7317.0
compared to

7312.8 --> 7318.28
this just imaginary imagine there's a an

7317.0 --> 7321.76
ancient city

7318.28 --> 7323.48
somewhere and it's like thrived for

7321.76 --> 7327.719
quite a while it's a trade City or

7323.48 --> 7330.5199999999995
something and then some Roman forces or

7327.719 --> 7334.28
something or phenicians get in there and

7330.52 --> 7336.84
they built a giant statue of a

7334.28 --> 7337.96
monster that looks really intimidating

7336.84 --> 7340.84
and

7337.96 --> 7343.8
like

7340.84 --> 7343.8
people are going to freak

7344.36 --> 7350.159
out it's going to curse the

7347.04 --> 7355.679
place cuz yeah it's just a statue but it

7350.159 --> 7358.638999999999
looks real it's radiating

7355.679 --> 7361.159
intimidation people will try to take it

7358.639 --> 7364.1990000000005
down but what if it's like giant cast

7361.159 --> 7367.36
iron and like cast iron in the age of

7364.199 --> 7370.96
bronze like people don't even know how

7367.36 --> 7370.96
how to do any damage to it

7372.28 --> 7377.0
So eventually they might just leave just

7374.48 --> 7378.5599999999995
because there's a freaking big Angry

7377.0 --> 7382.28
looking

7378.56 --> 7382.280000000001
statue of a giant

7383.36 --> 7388.759999999999
Warrior I feel that that's like what the

7385.599 --> 7394.0
hron collider is except it's science

7388.76 --> 7396.0
fiction style it's just a huge thing and

7394.0 --> 7399.159
there's all these rumors about how it

7396.0 --> 7402.32
could accidentally destroy the world

7399.159 --> 7405.48
excuse me that's like a giant steel

7402.32 --> 7408.32
statue of an angry demonic looking

7405.48 --> 7410.5599999999995
Warrior it's going to scare people out

7408.32 --> 7410.5599999999995
of

7414.28 --> 7419.0
town they're going to feel like it's not

7416.719 --> 7420.639
our town anymore and they try to

7419.0 --> 7422.28
organize get rid of it and then they

7420.639 --> 7425.04
can't it's too strong they can't break

7422.28 --> 7427.88
it they can't damage it and So

7425.04 --> 7430.559
eventually they kind of

7427.88 --> 7432.88
like either try to build a building

7430.559 --> 7434.159000000001
around it to kind of hide it or they

7432.88 --> 7438.159000000001
just

7434.159 --> 7438.159
leave it's like a curse on

7440.04 --> 7446.76
them so what the scientist do there walk

7443.84 --> 7448.96
around in lap codes do a bunch of

7446.76 --> 7451.719
astrophysic physicist nonsense

7448.96 --> 7453.76
calculations Divine squiggly lines and

7451.719 --> 7456.44
take a huge

7453.76 --> 7457.8
paycheck and write their Memoirs of how

7456.44 --> 7459.44
brilliant they are with all that

7457.8 --> 7462.1990000000005
nonsense

7459.44 --> 7462.199
that's what they do

7469.36 --> 7474.799999999999
there and yes what I just said is is a

7472.719 --> 7477.4
very accurate description of what it is

7474.8 --> 7477.400000000001
that they do

7484.44 --> 7489.32
there yeah that's no just don't say it

7487.92 --> 7491.52
like that please

7489.32 --> 7495.599
r

7491.52 --> 7495.599
g not going to read that out

7512.32 --> 7520.679
loud look it's a fine saying it's just I

7516.44 --> 7520.678999999999
just try to find something better

7523.199 --> 7529.32
you know that's what they do

7526.159 --> 7533.558999999999
maybe it all depends on what their diet

7529.32 --> 7536.599
is I mean a lot of doctors and nerds and

7533.559 --> 7539.719
scientists guys they eat a lot of crap

7536.599 --> 7543.1990000000005
they eat like terrible chips those

7539.719 --> 7545.719
people are not like super healthy diet

7543.199 --> 7548.04
people have you taken

7545.719 --> 7549.4800000000005
notice they're not going to want to do

7548.04 --> 7553.8
that on average

7549.48 --> 7553.799999999999
because it really stinks when that

7557.079 --> 7561.639
happens

7558.76 --> 7566.599
so slight

7561.639 --> 7569.719
misjudgment yeah nerds laboratory people

7566.599 --> 7572.52
astrophysicists math people they don't

7569.719 --> 7572.52
eat super

7577.599 --> 7580.599
healthy

7588.0 --> 7594.44
yeah mmaf that person is a

7591.559 --> 7597.679
troll that's really [ __ ] annoying and

7594.44 --> 7597.678999999999
banned wherever I

7600.28 --> 7606.88
can he's like a [ __ ] stalker it just

7604.48 --> 7606.879999999999
won't

7607.599 --> 7610.599
stop

7615.599 --> 7619.88
for [ __ ] he did some good shows on H

7618.44 --> 7623.32
CL yeah

7619.88 --> 7623.32
sure I was

7626.04 --> 7630.8
there oh Jimbo definitely got those

7637.52 --> 7640.52
things

7643.88 --> 7652.2390000000005
but I mean Jim Bob is now just the I

7646.92 --> 7655.36
hate own Benjamin channel so it's just

7652.239 --> 7657.638999999999
gross and we're all special boys and her

7655.36 --> 7662.239
Mano addicts are

7657.639 --> 7662.2390000000005
hell so not wasting my

7667.52 --> 7670.52
time

7687.58 --> 7690.71
[Music]

7691.04 --> 7701.199
yeah which yeah he has also been

7695.28 --> 7701.199
like debating against vegans he did

7717.36 --> 7723.0
that so the Shiva statue out of their

7721.079 --> 7727.32
building is just to provoke conspiracy

7723.0 --> 7729.52
theorist yes lons it is exactly that

7727.32 --> 7734.119
that's why that step

7729.52 --> 7736.4400000000005
statue was like they filmed a ritual

7734.119 --> 7740.199
that a bunch of rope people did as a

7736.44 --> 7743.719
supposed ceremony at the Statue and then

7740.199 --> 7746.558999999999
broadcasted it on television worldwide

7743.719 --> 7749.559
yeah you think that might have been done

7746.559 --> 7753.84
to provoke some conspiracy theorizing

7749.559 --> 7753.84
you think could it

7757.32 --> 7760.32
be

7770.8 --> 7778.28
yeah but I mean it's just they yeah

7775.36 --> 7778.28
people don't even get

7780.32 --> 7786.079
Shiva like so many people think that

7783.0 --> 7788.84
Shiva is bad Shiva is not

7786.079 --> 7790.44
bad and I'm not just talking talking

7788.84 --> 7794.32
about the

7790.44 --> 7799.239
doctor talking also about

7794.32 --> 7802.679
that that face of God the three faces

7799.239 --> 7805.678999999999
Shiva being one of them not

7802.679 --> 7805.679
bad

7817.239 --> 7820.239
transformative

7823.28 --> 7828.079
right

7824.32 --> 7830.159
Shiva the the dieties even in pantheons

7828.079 --> 7837.28
what are they what are they really they

7830.159 --> 7838.119
all represent a a power a an energy flux

7837.28 --> 7842.719
a

7838.119 --> 7844.44
frequency and what naturally comes with

7842.719 --> 7847.559
that power

7844.44 --> 7850.079
frequency that's what the old dieties

7847.559 --> 7852.92
represent and that's how it would be

7850.079 --> 7856.32
conceived that somebody would be

7852.92 --> 7859.679
possessed by a diety because they would

7856.32 --> 7861.5199999999995
display that frequency associated with

7859.679 --> 7863.719
the

7861.52 --> 7868.159000000001
dieting

7863.719 --> 7871.04
yeah Shiva not bad not bad at

7868.159 --> 7873.119
all

7871.04 --> 7876.0
transformative right I mean you want to

7873.119 --> 7879.4
know if a diety is dark or evil or

7876.0 --> 7882.159
whatever just look into what they do

7879.4 --> 7885.558999999999
just look in the background

7882.159 --> 7889.558999999999
information what do they

7885.559 --> 7892.320000000001
do Shiva the revealer right there so

7889.559 --> 7892.320000000001
much that Shiva

7895.76 --> 7902.92
does how do Christian vegans deal with

7899.48 --> 7902.919999999999
Jesus feeding people

7904.559 --> 7912.28
fish I don't think that we or anybody

7908.239 --> 7916.48
body should care about anybody that has

7912.28 --> 7918.96
veganism as some sort of religious thing

7916.48 --> 7918.959999999999
it's

7920.88 --> 7924.559
[ __ ] I'm sorry it

8035.679 --> 8039.719
the hell you want to see it it all

8037.36 --> 8042.558999999999
attitude is everything with it right

8039.719 --> 8045.679
Spirits it's just like oh fairy nature

8042.559 --> 8049.0
Spirits o the spirits of nature yeah

8045.679 --> 8053.36
well those can be Fantastical unless you

8049.0 --> 8053.36
suck and then they [ __ ] hate

8056.88 --> 8059.88
you

8064.48 --> 8068.919999999999
right but I

8066.199 --> 8072.759999999999
mean everybody that thinks that oh

8068.92 --> 8075.32
reptiles that means evil is a reptilian

8072.76 --> 8077.2390000000005
oh dude you just don't understand

8075.32 --> 8079.759999999999
reptiles at

8077.239 --> 8082.5199999999995
all you you want to have a different

8079.76 --> 8084.52
look on it just watch

8082.52 --> 8088.159000000001
blueberry or

8084.52 --> 8089.52
Renegade as it's also called and there

8088.159 --> 8093.119
you get

8089.52 --> 8094.280000000001
some personal hallucination experience

8093.119 --> 8097.96
based on

8094.28 --> 8100.04
naasa that shows you what the spirit of

8097.96 --> 8103.199
snakes really are the spirit of

8100.04 --> 8105.679
reptilians and versus the spirit of

8103.199 --> 8108.759999999999
insectoid and then you'll figure it out

8105.679 --> 8108.76
that they're not

8110.88 --> 8118.159000000001
bad snakes are not

8115.04 --> 8120.88
bad just because Indiana Jones is scared

8118.159 --> 8123.598999999999
of them doesn't mean they're

8120.88 --> 8127.079
bad just because

8123.599 --> 8129.400000000001
allegedly there was a snake early in

8127.079 --> 8132.44
history that supposedly

8129.4 --> 8135.28
ruined Mankind's life or

8132.44 --> 8136.159
something doesn't mean that snakes are

8135.28 --> 8139.28
all

8136.159 --> 8141.879999999999
bad snakes traditionally in the ancient

8139.28 --> 8143.679
world were symbols of wisdom why the

8141.88 --> 8145.92
hell do you think

8143.679 --> 8149.719
that

8145.92 --> 8153.32
Mercury Hermes had a staff with two

8149.719 --> 8155.44
snakes because snakes are the symbol of

8153.32 --> 8160.079
wisdom

8155.44 --> 8161.719
yeah dragons what is the trait of

8160.079 --> 8166.558999999999
dragons

8161.719 --> 8169.4
angry or but mostly Covetous and

8166.559 --> 8172.679
wise like you can't [ __ ] trick a

8169.4 --> 8176.719
dragon they're really [ __ ] wise and

8172.679 --> 8180.8
that's the problem yeah all indicates

8176.719 --> 8180.8
all indicators culturally

8181.04 --> 8188.199
historically snakes are

8184.639 --> 8188.1990000000005
good they're

8192.04 --> 8199.399000000001
wise yeah now it does mean a person

8194.96 --> 8202.279999999999
that's a being a snake treachery you you

8199.399 --> 8205.0
lied against yeah I find it offensive

8202.28 --> 8207.719000000001
that people even call that snakes yeah

8205.0 --> 8211.0
I'm sorry but have you ever caught a

8207.719 --> 8215.0
snake lying or trekking

8211.0 --> 8215.0
you did the snake trick

8215.2 --> 8221.639000000001
you I'm sorry but in all my experiences

8218.76 --> 8224.84
snakes are actually pretty damn

8221.639 --> 8228.8
straightforward they announce themselves

8224.84 --> 8231.76
yeah they're straightforward a rattle

8228.8 --> 8234.8
snake when he notices someone something

8231.76 --> 8237.399
is near it

8234.8 --> 8239.559
start yeah why do you think it does that

8237.399 --> 8242.88
it's not because it's Sneaky trying to

8239.559 --> 8247.199999999999
deceive you it's because hey I'm

8242.88 --> 8249.639
here hello get away from me that's

8247.2 --> 8249.639000000001
called

8251.399 --> 8257.599
honesty yeah that's not being a sneaky

8255.12 --> 8260.399000000001
bastard and like that snakes just sneak

8257.599 --> 8260.399
sneak attack

8260.96 --> 8266.518999999998
people they usually

8263.76 --> 8268.479
don't unless you catch them completely

8266.519 --> 8271.399
off guard and then they

8268.479 --> 8273.599
might if you're scared of snakes and

8271.399 --> 8273.599
they

8284.359 --> 8289.599
Panic what the hell are you talking

8286.88 --> 8289.598999999998
about out

8292.559 --> 8299.518999999998
there I have absolutely no idea who you

8296.88 --> 8299.518999999998
guys are talking

8299.719 --> 8304.358999999999
about for like the last page

8321.28 --> 8325.439
here unless they're scared or hungry

8323.76 --> 8328.439
yeah I'm

8325.439 --> 8331.28
AAL but I mean creature don't just

8328.439 --> 8334.24
attack because they're hungry they only

8331.28 --> 8338.84
attack when they're hungry when you seem

8334.24 --> 8341.92
like a sizable prey for them like a

8338.84 --> 8343.92
snake that's not like a giant boa

8341.92 --> 8347.559
constrictor or something is not going to

8343.92 --> 8350.639
try to attack a human being to eat them

8347.559 --> 8353.399
it's way too big doesn't matter how

8350.639 --> 8355.759999999998
hungry they it's just out of it's like

8353.399 --> 8359.439
not to scale they could just can't

8355.76 --> 8359.439
doesn't work

8361.599 --> 8366.359
but yeah snakes can be very

8369.679 --> 8375.599
defensive right so the Gaton flag that's

8374.12 --> 8377.880000000001
where that comes from it's like they

8375.599 --> 8382.08
announce themselves they're

8377.88 --> 8384.719
honest yeah the snake is not a symbol of

8382.08 --> 8387.679
Satan or

8384.719 --> 8390.919999999998
treachery and the Gaton flag should

8387.679 --> 8393.8
remind you of that that it isn't that I

8390.92 --> 8393.8
don't see it as

8393.96 --> 8398.279999999999
such I'm almost going to get to the

8396.24 --> 8403.16
point where I'm saying like I blame the

8398.28 --> 8403.16
Vatican for basically scapegoating the

8404.04 --> 8413.240000000002
snake to undermine the old respect for

8409.0 --> 8413.24
the old symbol of

8416.359 --> 8420.479000000001
wisdom

8417.88 --> 8423.92
they swallow sheep hole well it's got to

8420.479 --> 8426.599999999999
be a really big yeah boa yeah that's why

8423.92 --> 8429.16
I said specifically M that a boa which

8426.6 --> 8433.16
can get huge yeah they might eat a

8429.16 --> 8434.56
human but I mean other types of snakes

8433.16 --> 8436.92
that aren't that big they're not going

8434.56 --> 8439.16
to do that because they can't they can't

8436.92 --> 8440.84
eat a human they might eat a little kid

8439.16 --> 8444.0
or something at

8440.84 --> 8446.319
best but not a a regular adult is just

8444.0 --> 8449.319
way too

8446.319 --> 8449.319
big

8453.439 --> 8459.16
yeah right I mean a regular size snake

8456.64 --> 8460.439
yeah they will like eat a cat or a dog

8459.16 --> 8462.6
or

8460.439 --> 8466.24
something

8462.6 --> 8469.24
definitely but not a human it doesn't

8466.24 --> 8469.24
fit

8471.439 --> 8479.24
anyway yeah I know MMA I've seen

8475.08 --> 8479.24
it it's bizarre

8484.8 --> 8489.358999999999
the most bizarre thing about it is

8487.24 --> 8492.16
that that

8489.359 --> 8494.2
the that it basically doesn't rip the

8492.16 --> 8497.2
snake apart that's the weirdest thing

8494.2 --> 8500.240000000002
about it is that that the

8497.2 --> 8503.04
swallow what do you call that the

8500.24 --> 8506.479
swallowing tube of the snake that that

8503.04 --> 8509.319000000001
whole thing can stretch that much that's

8506.479 --> 8512.08
like the crazy part about

8509.319 --> 8514.039999999999
it it's like how the hell is it even

8512.08 --> 8517.0
able to stretch that

8514.04 --> 8519.0
without like ripping it apart that's

8517.0 --> 8521.2
like the Curious part most curious part

8519.0 --> 8521.2
about

8521.399 --> 8527.199999999999
it weird elasticity to like the snake's

8529.92 --> 8535.84
body yeah and then they have to reggit

8532.8 --> 8535.84
yeah that does happen love

8536.16 --> 8539.16
fruit

8542.72 --> 8546.039999999999
hello diver Dan Navy

8566.16 --> 8569.16
vet

8571.56 --> 8576.76
Florida is full of

8574.359 --> 8579.04
boas because people let it out in the

8576.76 --> 8581.08
wild pretty amazing that they just

8579.04 --> 8583.399000000001
survived then there

8581.08 --> 8586.72
though like that's always a thing you

8583.399 --> 8588.92
know is like yeah theoretically oh you

8586.72 --> 8591.84
get an exotic pet and you're like oh I'm

8588.92 --> 8594.359
just going to let it in nature but a lot

8591.84 --> 8596.64
of the time when you do that house

8594.359 --> 8598.479000000001
broken pets that you release in the wild

8596.64 --> 8602.439
they just

8598.479 --> 8605.56
die they don't have that they're

8602.439 --> 8609.56
domesticated they can't do it so if a

8605.56 --> 8614.0
species just manages to actually

8609.56 --> 8614.0
integrate into the wild that's pretty

8617.64 --> 8623.278999999999
special so in a way that's kind of

8620.2 --> 8626.08
interesting that boas are so prevalent

8623.279 --> 8629.08
now in Florida

8626.08 --> 8629.08
Everglades

8631.88 --> 8636.759999999998
and anyway isn't it kind of

8634.439 --> 8639.720000000001
cool I mean it's always going to be cool

8636.76 --> 8642.64
to like hey hey tourist check that out

8639.72 --> 8644.679999999998
there's another boa I mean it's yeah

8642.64 --> 8646.96
unless you're like Indiana Jones that's

8644.68 --> 8646.960000000001
pretty

8648.99 --> 8652.18
[Music]

8655.52 --> 8660.890000000001
cool now don't have natural

8659.439 --> 8662.880000000001
Predators

8660.89 --> 8666.16
[Music]

8662.88 --> 8666.16
H good

8666.56 --> 8674.039999999999
point although really none like not even

8670.68 --> 8674.04
like crocodiles or

8676.92 --> 8680.88
something or Gators or

8685.96 --> 8692.16
whatever

8687.56 --> 8692.16
huge iguana problems H

8700.279 --> 8707.16
typical I mean I can imagine that

8702.84 --> 8707.16
iguanas and boa

8708.2 --> 8713.560000000001
constrictors and maybe alligate like

8710.439 --> 8713.56
they would definitely

8715.88 --> 8718.88
compete

8719.6 --> 8725.56
giant Everglade boas fighting with yeah

8722.56 --> 8729.319
that's what I thought that they would so

8725.56 --> 8733.199999999999
they do have natural enemies is night

8729.319 --> 8736.96
they're not being prayed upon but they

8733.2 --> 8736.960000000001
will end up duking it out with

8737.439 --> 8742.2
competitors and they would occasionally

8739.72 --> 8743.88
eat eat each other I can imagine the boa

8742.2 --> 8747.92
would try to attempt to eat small

8743.88 --> 8749.72
alligators and that alligators will will

8747.92 --> 8752.88
take a bite out of out of boa

8749.72 --> 8752.88
constrictors if they got the

8759.84 --> 8766.439
chance snakes produce so fast really

8763.2 --> 8766.439
they do

8767.479 --> 8773.679999999998
huh but don't alligators also reproduce

8771.04 --> 8773.68
relatively

8774.92 --> 8780.08
fast I didn't know wellow

8778.16 --> 8783.2
so there's like the snakes are like

8780.08 --> 8785.479
doing too well almost you could say

8783.2 --> 8785.479000000001
that's

8785.6 --> 8791.439
typical has it ever been considered like

8788.279 --> 8793.560000000001
if they're like so much of them aren't

8791.439 --> 8797.6
they like

8793.56 --> 8801.68
edible isn't it basically like a a huge

8797.6 --> 8804.6
muscle and couldn't you like use the the

8801.68 --> 8807.64
skin for leather stuff I mean you

8804.6 --> 8809.359
already use alligators for the leather

8807.64 --> 8812.199999999999
and

8809.359 --> 8814.479000000001
meet why not boa

8812.2 --> 8817.92
constrictors right you can make pretty

8814.479 --> 8820.599999999999
slick shoes from them and who knows what

8817.92 --> 8823.2
else and lots of meat on them if they're

8820.6 --> 8825.800000000001
like like literally just pouring out of

8823.2 --> 8827.52
the swamp well then you might just as

8825.8 --> 8830.72
well start using

8827.52 --> 8830.720000000001
them why

8832.72 --> 8837.479
not cobras can move over 30 miles an

8835.84 --> 8840.6
hour wow

8837.479 --> 8840.599999999999
that is pretty quick

8841.56 --> 8846.479
yeah they are hunted and there is

8843.8 --> 8849.92
actually a bounty on oh cool

8846.479 --> 8852.76
okay good you don't want to let it go

8849.92 --> 8855.68
out of control otherwise like there will

8852.76 --> 8857.92
literally be people complaining about

8855.68 --> 8859.439
boa constrictors continually ending up

8857.92 --> 8862.76
in their pools and

8859.439 --> 8864.880000000001
[ __ ] you don't want that to happen I

8862.76 --> 8866.92
mean boa constrictors are pretty cool

8864.88 --> 8868.24
and all but they will literally eat your

8866.92 --> 8869.76
kid if they're big enough and they got

8868.24 --> 8874.399
the chance

8869.76 --> 8874.399
so yeah you don't want

8878.8 --> 8885.358999999999
that gr alligators yeah tasted like

8883.12 --> 8887.12
chicken marinated in swamp

8885.359 --> 8893.52
but

8887.12 --> 8896.0
yuck yeah I yeah I mean it's it might be

8893.52 --> 8899.12
doable but maybe like if you let the

8896.0 --> 8901.2
alligator just you'd have to like catch

8899.12 --> 8904.880000000001
them not wound them and then basically

8901.2 --> 8907.68
have them sit in like really clean water

8904.88 --> 8908.64
and they might stop tasting like swamp

8907.68 --> 8911.359
water

8908.64 --> 8913.64
then you basically have to like clean

8911.359 --> 8918.08
them out while they're still

8913.64 --> 8920.8
alive and then give them some proper

8918.08 --> 8924.12
unpolluted meat to

8920.8 --> 8926.8
eat it's like ra your alligators with

8924.12 --> 8931.160000000002
organic food for a while and then they

8926.8 --> 8931.16
will taste less like swamp

8931.88 --> 8938.72
water but I

8934.24 --> 8938.72
mean yeah better than nothing at all I

8939.439 --> 8947.24
guess right if you just had no meat if

8942.2 --> 8950.84
soly like beef is nowhere available well

8947.24 --> 8953.08
you could still eat alligator I mean I

8950.84 --> 8955.24
guess it's kind of not so

8953.08 --> 8959.399
great but you're not going to like get

8955.24 --> 8959.399
sick from that right it is still

8961.12 --> 8964.68
doable better than

8980.72 --> 8986.679999999998
bugs but I mean I think alligator would

8983.76 --> 8989.319
probably taste fine if you add plenty of

8986.68 --> 8989.319
spices to

8994.24 --> 8999.08
it right just add a whole bunch of

8997.08 --> 9001.72
Indian spices to

8999.08 --> 9004.439
it which work great with chicken so if

9001.72 --> 9007.399
it tastes like chicken well add those

9004.439 --> 9008.68
and make it like a curry almost a curry

9007.399 --> 9011.399
chicken

9008.68 --> 9013.479000000001
thing like

9011.399 --> 9015.439
add uh

9013.479 --> 9017.0
turmeric black

9015.439 --> 9019.08
pepper

9017.0 --> 9022.76
some

9019.08 --> 9026.76
ginger uh perhaps some other stuff too

9022.76 --> 9028.76
and like don't hold back and like before

9026.76 --> 9030.399
you know it it's just great it's just

9028.76 --> 9032.84
tastes like chicken and you can barely

9030.399 --> 9036.76
even taste the swamp

9032.84 --> 9036.76
water it probably would

9038.72 --> 9042.84
work and I mean what harm can I

9045.439 --> 9048.439
do

9061.04 --> 9065.439
who Okay blue pill Evolution good to

9066.04 --> 9071.76
know alligator Curry sounds like a

9068.8 --> 9071.759999999998
sketchy Curry to

9075.359 --> 9079.880000000001
me

9077.439 --> 9085.04
I don't know try it out and then tell me

9079.88 --> 9085.039999999999
if it's better than just regular

9087.319 --> 9091.6
alligator I

9088.96 --> 9094.399
mean there's no alligators here so

9091.6 --> 9098.319
there's no way for me to ever even try

9094.399 --> 9100.8
that but yeah where you're at you can

9098.319 --> 9105.359
definitely try

9100.8 --> 9109.319
that and then see like is it still

9105.359 --> 9109.319
gross or not so

9127.16 --> 9134.68
gross grubs can taste like shrimp if you

9130.88 --> 9134.679999999998
know how what

9135.279 --> 9138.279
okay

9142.12 --> 9147.399000000001
oh that that's very useful KN di that

9145.6 --> 9149.800000000001
like those are really useful types of

9147.399 --> 9149.8
things to

9149.96 --> 9156.278999999999
learn big advantage of indeed like being

9153.279 --> 9156.279
in the Navy and all

9165.24 --> 9168.24
that

9186.12 --> 9189.76
grub what the [ __ ] is a

9192.96 --> 9198.16
grub grub what the hell is grub

9198.66 --> 9201.739
[Music]

9207.319 --> 9210.76
what is that a

9213.52 --> 9216.52
worm

9224.52 --> 9230.08
what bugs

9226.68 --> 9232.76
yeah is that the typical the wood maggot

9230.08 --> 9236.84
right the white thing with like

9232.76 --> 9239.64
the scaly

9236.84 --> 9243.52
eyes like the they have a black head

9239.64 --> 9246.039999999999
with like mouth clo thing manales and

9243.52 --> 9248.92
the rest is all white they're those are

9246.04 --> 9252.399000000001
like super healthy apparently I mean

9248.92 --> 9255.12
gross but like like one of the best

9252.399 --> 9256.599999999999
snacks that the aboriginals know Beatle

9255.12 --> 9260.0
RV yeah exactly

9256.6 --> 9263.12
so that's a grub okay all

9260.0 --> 9265.2
right yeah not going to be my favorite

9263.12 --> 9267.560000000001
but I mean if I got lost in the jungle I

9265.2 --> 9272.880000000001
would definitely eat

9267.56 --> 9276.199999999999
those because they are actually very

9272.88 --> 9276.199999999999
nutritious it's

9277.12 --> 9285.08
just I personally prefer to basically

9280.359 --> 9288.08
grind it before I eat it or something

9285.08 --> 9290.76
yuck yeah I don't like it but I mean

9288.08 --> 9293.479
those bugs are

9290.76 --> 9297.279
actually good enough to

9293.479 --> 9299.96
eat they don't have like high chitten

9297.279 --> 9301.880000000001
they don't have like the scaly [ __ ]

9299.96 --> 9304.039999999999
unless you eat unless you swallow the

9301.88 --> 9306.519999999999
head right because the rest is like all

9304.04 --> 9306.52
it's just

9307.08 --> 9313.24
this this bag of protein it's not scaly

9311.52 --> 9315.0
those creatures aren't scaly only the

9313.24 --> 9318.0
head is

9315.0 --> 9318.0
scaly

9318.2 --> 9323.640000000001
so they are basically the least

9320.16 --> 9325.96
unhealthy bugs to eat really and there's

9323.64 --> 9328.399
been people that have literally survived

9325.96 --> 9331.24
multiple Generations on them countless

9328.399 --> 9335.119999999999
Generations potentially

9331.24 --> 9337.399
so in in those countries like old

9335.12 --> 9340.880000000001
aboriginals and in Africa perhaps

9337.399 --> 9343.16
they're considered like a luxury food

9340.88 --> 9345.479
like you find that that's like awesome

9343.16 --> 9347.96
everybody's happy cuz that's really good

9345.479 --> 9347.96
food for them

9348.12 --> 9357.12
them but yeah not a big fan

9352.2 --> 9357.12
personally I just know their

9367.22 --> 9370.279999999999
[Music]

9386.439 --> 9391.92

9389.64 --> 9394.0
happening just like what two and a half

9391.92 --> 9399.319
hours oh

9394.0 --> 9399.319
okay I thought it was just like a 1 hour

9455.72 --> 9460.278999999999
guy they tasted like Mexican

9462.319 --> 9470.0
candy is that just like ant cookie

9466.72 --> 9470.0
I'm not a fan of those

9473.319 --> 9478.359
things like chocolate ant cookies there

9476.439 --> 9480.439
like chocolate chip cookies except

9478.359 --> 9483.880000000001
there's ants in there

9480.439 --> 9487.64
too sorry for that imagery but that was

9483.88 --> 9487.64
real I never ate

9494.72 --> 9497.72

yeah this is a very

9570.68 --> 9574.16
unusual subject

9574.96 --> 9578.8
today weird wild

9580.84 --> 9583.899
[Music]

9584.64 --> 9591.199999999999
cuisine yeah I'm calling it wild food

9588.24 --> 9591.199999999999
that can eat you

9608.84 --> 9612.92
too hey LSG good to see

9614.56 --> 9617.56
you

9622.6 --> 9626.359
oh that's mean blue Bel

9635.92 --> 9640.72
Devolution lots of scorpions in Idaho

9644.0 --> 9649.479
okay I was a kid don't kill things I

9646.76 --> 9649.479
never kill

9651.88 --> 9659.039999999999
things I think I killed a couple of

9655.24 --> 9663.08
ants with this magnifying glass classic

9659.04 --> 9665.399000000001
and that's like the last time I ever did

9663.08 --> 9668.439
anything like that it's like I

9665.399 --> 9670.96
don't like even a [ __ ] ant just made

9668.439 --> 9674.08
me feel bad I'm like I'm not doing it

9670.96 --> 9678.479
anymore I'm not hurting anything any

9674.08 --> 9682.16
life like that for my Amusement ever

9678.479 --> 9682.16
again and so I

9698.2 --> 9703.359
did it's like I got this thing and it's

9700.84 --> 9706.880000000001
like you can't kill life

9703.359 --> 9710.16
unless it's in acute cell selfdefense or

9706.88 --> 9710.16
because you're going to eat

9713.24 --> 9717.52
it and that's just how I look at

9720.84 --> 9724.960000000001
it

9722.64 --> 9727.319
right so it is like oh you're going to

9724.96 --> 9730.319
kill that thing well then you better eat

9727.319 --> 9730.319
it

9734.359 --> 9739.800000000001
right

9736.8 --> 9743.16
bug exoskeleton are C energetic yeah

9739.8 --> 9743.16
they are they're called

9744.92 --> 9749.04
chatin or Chen or

9752.279 --> 9758.6
something and that stuff when it breaks

9755.52 --> 9761.319000000001
down in your digestive system it

9758.6 --> 9766.56
literally causes inflammations like if

9761.319 --> 9769.399
you eat bugs continually like every day

9766.56 --> 9772.8
like half of all your consumption you'll

9769.399 --> 9774.56
probably start to develop like

9772.8 --> 9776.319
inflammation then it's like you're going

9774.56 --> 9779.278999999999
to have like oh

9776.319 --> 9782.119999999999
suddenly like muscles are going to hurt

9779.279 --> 9783.479000000001
and shoulders and your hips and like

9782.12 --> 9786.319000000001
everything is going to just start

9783.479 --> 9788.84
hurting eventually that's what [ __ ]

9786.319 --> 9791.519999999999
chit does it's

9788.84 --> 9794.279
terrible it's it just creates giant

9791.52 --> 9796.52
inflammation in your body makes it all

9794.279 --> 9798.960000000001
worse

9796.52 --> 9800.92
it's like literally an

9798.96 --> 9803.8
inflammatory that that's what chitting

9800.92 --> 9805.399
is it's not good I mean a little bit or

9803.8 --> 9808.119999999999
one time yeah it's

9805.399 --> 9810.92
doable but especially if you have like

9808.12 --> 9813.359
chronic health conditions that involve

9810.92 --> 9815.0
inflammation you better damn well stay

9813.359 --> 9816.880000000001
away from that

9815.0 --> 9819.72
[ __ ]

9816.88 --> 9823.839999999998
right because that's [ __ ] unhealthy

9819.72 --> 9827.399
and the Same by the way goes for non

9823.84 --> 9829.6
insectoid creatures is like crab because

9827.399 --> 9832.8
they have shells too they have chattin

9829.6 --> 9835.279
too and lobster they have shells that

9832.8 --> 9837.358999999999
has Chet too it's the same stuff they're

9835.279 --> 9839.76
basically also insect they're underwater

9837.359 --> 9839.76
giant

9841.6 --> 9846.319
insects so you better be careful with

9844.0 --> 9846.319
that as

9848.6 --> 9856.0
well eating chunks of Ginger yeah yeah

9851.319 --> 9858.359
it's very healthy and is good for SE and

9856.0 --> 9860.92
car sickness did you know that blue peld

9858.359 --> 9862.399000000001
Evolution and if anybody in your family

9860.92 --> 9864.359
or a little kid usually when you're

9862.399 --> 9866.439
younger you have it more they can get

9864.359 --> 9869.04
like car sickness right you might have

9866.439 --> 9870.359
heard of somebody that has that give

9869.04 --> 9874.720000000001
them ginger

9870.359 --> 9876.68
root give them like the raw juice it's a

9874.72 --> 9879.08
bit hot right so you might want to

9876.68 --> 9881.04
lengthen it down a bit with water hope

9879.08 --> 9882.84
that they do like the taste some people

9881.04 --> 9884.160000000002
really dislike the taste of ginger well

9882.84 --> 9888.56
then they got a

9884.16 --> 9891.24
problem but if you're car sick Ginger is

9888.56 --> 9891.24
the ultimate

9892.52 --> 9898.84
remedy is the main ingredient in

9895.24 --> 9902.199999999999
dram oh okay of course there is a

9898.84 --> 9904.84
specific medicine thing it's just I just

9902.2 --> 9908.08
take the root just take a a ginger root

9904.84 --> 9911.960000000001
with you oh no got to buy a special

9908.08 --> 9914.08
extract bottle that's no just a ginger

9911.96 --> 9917.08
root just take the

9914.08 --> 9917.08
root

9921.64 --> 9925.319
I mean like literally just take a root

9924.0 --> 9929.0
with

9925.319 --> 9932.16
you and then just squeeze

9929.0 --> 9936.479
it like in a press or

9932.16 --> 9940.08
something and it just raw Juice drink it

9936.479 --> 9940.08
dude car sickness

9943.0 --> 9948.52
over yeah and turmeric

9946.0 --> 9951.0
yes of course has a lot of other

9948.52 --> 9952.720000000001
positive influences and they work

9951.0 --> 9954.319
together by the way Ginger and turmeric

9952.72 --> 9956.199999999999
taste wise work

9954.319 --> 9958.16
together and they don't get in each

9956.2 --> 9961.16
other's way medic like with the health

9958.16 --> 9964.68
benefits and toer of course is amazing

9961.16 --> 9968.399
what it can do for your overall body

9964.68 --> 9970.479000000001
recovery regeneration like muscle

9968.399 --> 9973.72
growth uh

9970.479 --> 9977.88
tendons like your joints if you have any

9973.72 --> 9982.199999999999
kind of issues or stiff and or like even

9977.88 --> 9986.24
arthritis well guess what like turmeric

9982.2 --> 9989.84
will like really push all of that back

9986.24 --> 9989.84
and like make you incredibly

9989.96 --> 9998.16
subtle so like if you have any arthritis

9994.279 --> 10001.319000000001
in your family you're going to have you

9998.16 --> 10002.96
want to have turmeric basically you want

10001.319 --> 10006.76
to have turmeric knowledge in that

10002.96 --> 10009.759999999998
family very much want that

10006.76 --> 10012.6
funnily enough my family didn't know

10009.76 --> 10015.76
that my they didn't know about

10012.6 --> 10017.479000000001
it and my grandmother and my mother both

10015.76 --> 10020.12
had

10017.479 --> 10023.64
arthritis and started at my

10020.12 --> 10026.04
age they didn't know about

10023.64 --> 10028.319
turmeric they really didn't they heard

10026.04 --> 10032.6
that there were special spices in India

10028.319 --> 10036.72
and stuff but they they never really

10032.6 --> 10041.12
like let's try that we weren't like into

10036.72 --> 10044.479
Curry and stuff we weren't into that and

10041.12 --> 10047.84
like some like traditional Indian food

10044.479 --> 10048.84
we didn't like we didn't like how they

10047.84 --> 10052.2
cooked

10048.84 --> 10054.279
it it's like this The Taste balance is

10052.2 --> 10057.92
just completely

10054.279 --> 10060.640000000001
wrong I use to American Ginger and more

10057.92 --> 10063.68
Indian or Indonesian cooking but I do it

10060.64 --> 10066.56
my own style my own taste balance which

10063.68 --> 10069.56
is very different from how we originally

10066.56 --> 10072.519999999999
got the sample all that it's like so

10069.56 --> 10075.039999999999
different tasting like it's like not

10072.52 --> 10077.84
sweet enough not sour enough not salt

10075.04 --> 10080.160000000002
enough it's just like yeah it's just

10077.84 --> 10081.880000000001
weird combination of tastes that's what

10080.16 --> 10084.279
how we experient Indian food and it was

10081.88 --> 10086.96
never really like oh yeah let's do that

10084.279 --> 10090.319000000001
and I was like I don't really like the

10086.96 --> 10093.199999999999
taste of this I just it doesn't

10090.319 --> 10095.68
work but use that stuff yourself and you

10093.2 --> 10096.92
can do great things with it

10095.68 --> 10101.84
great

10096.92 --> 10105.88
things like make a ginger

10101.84 --> 10107.12
chicken yeah chop pieces of chicken

10105.88 --> 10110.56
organic of

10107.12 --> 10114.68
course and then like season them before

10110.56 --> 10117.56
you do anything with it so with ginger

10114.68 --> 10121.0
powder some turmeric powder black PE

10117.56 --> 10126.8
Pepper powder good

10121.0 --> 10126.8
salts like yeah good mineral Rich salt

10127.279 --> 10135.0
let it soak in for a bit right great

10131.399 --> 10138.92
it's fantastic that's the way to do

10135.0 --> 10143.24
it arthritis Rising among Indians

10138.92 --> 10146.2
too I'm sure it is cuz probably they are

10143.24 --> 10148.64
abandoning a lot of spicy stuff they're

10146.2 --> 10150.92
all gentrifying they're all

10148.64 --> 10152.68
modernizing oh we're going to be as

10150.92 --> 10154.439
special as the West too well then you're

10152.68 --> 10156.720000000001
going to inherit all our diseases as

10154.439 --> 10156.720000000001
well

10156.88 --> 10159.759999999998
cuz that's what we

10163.16 --> 10170.76
got I bet that the old

10167.68 --> 10172.6
traditionalist Indian people that do old

10170.76 --> 10175.16
fashion Indian cooking I don't think

10172.6 --> 10175.16
they have

10176.52 --> 10181.6
arthritis or

10179.04 --> 10184.359
barely I mean they might have it it just

10181.6 --> 10188.0
won't bother them like I potentially

10184.359 --> 10191.399000000001
have arthritis it's just that it never

10188.0 --> 10193.92
gets really bad my mother had a lot more

10191.399 --> 10197.56
issues with her arthritis when she was

10193.92 --> 10200.319
my age my the age that I am currently I

10197.56 --> 10203.72
barely have issues I'm just noticing

10200.319 --> 10205.8
like like I the the potential seems to

10203.72 --> 10208.76
be presenting itself I have to be

10205.8 --> 10211.599999999999
careful my mother had like real issues

10208.76 --> 10211.6
with it at my

10213.64 --> 10216.64
age

10217.479 --> 10222.519999999999
ah you saw me there blue P Devolution

10219.479 --> 10225.0
yeah Dr Shiva I love the there's so many

10222.52 --> 10227.239
streams that I like and I like to just

10225.0 --> 10229.56
roll in there and just supplement it

10227.239 --> 10229.56
with my

10230.279 --> 10234.319000000001
knowledge yesterday was weird by the way

10232.64 --> 10236.8
did you also notice at the

10234.319 --> 10239.239
end that like the stream something went

10236.8 --> 10242.56
wrong or something and then Dr Shiva

10239.239 --> 10244.68
drank some water shortly before rounding

10242.56 --> 10248.6
out but he drank it from a plastic

10244.68 --> 10251.960000000001
bottle and I was like what you drink

10248.6 --> 10254.640000000001
water from a plastic bottle what the

10251.96 --> 10254.64
[ __ ] Dr

10254.92 --> 10259.64
Shiva yeah you saw me pointing I was

10257.72 --> 10261.56
genuinely shocked there I was like yet

10259.64 --> 10263.64
don't I please don't think I'm a gamma

10261.56 --> 10266.119999999999
or something but I'm really shocked by

10263.64 --> 10270.16
that you actually allow yourself to

10266.12 --> 10270.160000000002
drink from plastic bottles

10273.56 --> 10276.56
what

10283.0 --> 10288.0
H right I really hope he did pick up on

10285.8 --> 10290.92
that by the way maybe he just like

10288.0 --> 10293.12
didn't think of it hopefully he will

10290.92 --> 10296.76
actually take that Ser it's really

10293.12 --> 10299.439
serious I mean best F really does Leech

10296.76 --> 10301.84
from the plastic bottles it really does

10299.439 --> 10303.2
have an influence on your hormonal

10301.84 --> 10306.319
system because it's an endocrine

10303.2 --> 10310.12
disruptor it just does that at an old

10306.319 --> 10310.119999999999
age as well it's not

10310.84 --> 10315.16
healthy like I never drink from plastic

10313.359 --> 10317.800000000001
bot I haven't drank from a plastic

10315.16 --> 10321.64
bottle since the '90s

10317.8 --> 10321.64
I just never did

10325.88 --> 10330.96
that that's no it's not

10331.8 --> 10337.72
true yeah I did drink from plastic B up

10335.08 --> 10341.439
until I got my actual ceramic water

10337.72 --> 10341.438999999998
filter which is the first one in

10341.8 --> 10346.999
200 2006

10343.94 --> 10346.999
[Music]

10348.04 --> 10351.04
7

10352.0 --> 10356.8
2007 and with that I also completely

10354.84 --> 10358.84
stopped drinking from plastic bottles

10356.8 --> 10360.84
it's really when I've learned a lot

10358.84 --> 10361.8
about the water Flor radiation even

10360.84 --> 10363.439
though that doesn't happen in the

10361.8 --> 10365.0
Netherlands but there's plenty of other

10363.439 --> 10367.04
junk

10365.0 --> 10369.239
like bacterial

10367.04 --> 10372.04
remnants that that's kind of still in

10369.239 --> 10374.199999999999
drinking water and so I still filter it

10372.04 --> 10376.04
it does how it tastes so much better and

10374.2 --> 10378.16
the drinking water here is a pretty good

10376.04 --> 10380.12
quality for tap water it really is good

10378.16 --> 10382.88
quality for World

10380.12 --> 10386.08
standard but it's even better when you

10382.88 --> 10387.96
ceramic filter it it really is like the

10386.08 --> 10390.88
best fresh spring water

10387.96 --> 10393.72
ever it's great and the plants love it

10390.88 --> 10396.358999999999
more too like they Thrive with that

10393.72 --> 10396.358999999999
water

10404.6 --> 10408.6
right and I learned about fluoride and

10406.56 --> 10411.6
water and about best funeral a in the

10408.6 --> 10415.239
plastic water and that's like when I

10411.6 --> 10416.960000000001
really was like I I want pure water I

10415.239 --> 10418.56
really want the water it's like one of

10416.96 --> 10421.519999999999
the first thing that I really decided

10418.56 --> 10423.72
like I have to drink pure water that was

10421.52 --> 10426.439
the first decision and then as I was

10423.72 --> 10429.64
doing that no noticing immediately after

10426.439 --> 10431.56
I got it is like everything I felt like

10429.64 --> 10435.119999999999
I stopped getting medicated all of a

10431.56 --> 10438.56
sudden doing that it really did it felt

10435.12 --> 10439.92
like I stopped being medicated just by

10438.56 --> 10444.8
suddenly

10439.92 --> 10448.439
deciding to only drink through water

10444.8 --> 10450.08
filters and I physically like I felt

10448.439 --> 10451.92
that everything changed because it's

10450.08 --> 10453.84
like suddenly not taking medication

10451.92 --> 10455.12
anyway it just it's what it felt like

10453.84 --> 10459.84
back then

10455.12 --> 10462.399000000001
it really did and then I topped that by

10459.84 --> 10465.04
okay well then I'm also going to eat all

10462.399 --> 10466.96
organic now no more non-organic I I

10465.04 --> 10469.720000000001
don't want the pesticides in the fats I

10466.96 --> 10472.88
want only the best

10469.72 --> 10475.319
fats and well combining that it it it

10472.88 --> 10478.519999999999
transformed

10475.319 --> 10482.359
me I realized that I could be

10478.52 --> 10484.880000000001
much more functional and better overall

10482.359 --> 10487.52
than I ever thought I could be

10484.88 --> 10489.72
after doing that I knew it I knew like I

10487.52 --> 10492.239
am actually much smarter than I thought

10489.72 --> 10496.039999999999
I am I'm much healthier than I thought I

10492.239 --> 10498.039999999999
am I'm going to age much slower than I

10496.04 --> 10501.12
thought I would all of those things

10498.04 --> 10501.12
happened around

10501.76 --> 10508.880000000001
2007 and mostly inspired at the time by

10505.04 --> 10511.52
Alex Jones and Mike Adams and Dr uh

10508.88 --> 10511.519999999999
what's he called

10511.76 --> 10518.64
again the guy that kind of like help

10514.319 --> 10520.76
helped Alex set up his earliest

10518.64 --> 10523.039999999999
products I forget his name he's pretty

10520.76 --> 10523.04
cool

10526.0 --> 10531.279
guy what's anybody here probably

10537.359 --> 10546.2
not I don't remember he's kind of like

10541.479 --> 10546.199999999999
a is like a bit of a Californian

10546.96 --> 10553.64
accent don't remember I'm terrible with

10550.56 --> 10555.399
names but yeah they all all of them was

10553.64 --> 10557.119999999999
a lot of Health talk on the Alex Jones

10555.399 --> 10559.479
Show I was prescribed to prison

10557.12 --> 10561.800000000001
prisonplanet.tv so I got to see Alex

10559.479 --> 10564.88
Jones live streaming in his like

10561.8 --> 10568.199999999999
earliest of live streams before he was

10564.88 --> 10569.96
just like periodic broadcast he did a

10568.2 --> 10572.880000000001
periodic broadcast well he started to do

10569.96 --> 10575.839999999998
like everyday streams and that showed on

10572.88 --> 10577.599999999999
prisonplanet.tv which was a paid only

10575.84 --> 10582.84
platform I paid

10577.6 --> 10585.279
like was it like €60 a year for that but

10582.84 --> 10589.6
it was so well worth it I mean I got

10585.279 --> 10592.640000000001
like the best Alex Jones quality stuff

10589.6 --> 10595.08
and I got so much early early heads up

10592.64 --> 10600.92
with things when that didn't exist out

10595.08 --> 10603.64
here people Alex Jones defined the bar

10600.92 --> 10607.2
when when he did that very early he

10603.64 --> 10609.399
defined find it now he's not as

10607.2 --> 10611.52
revolutionary as he used to be anymore

10609.399 --> 10617.56
he's mostly like

10611.52 --> 10617.560000000001
just recycling his his old scores

10618.439 --> 10623.84
basically but at the time was absolutely

10621.399 --> 10627.72
amazing everything that I learned there

10623.84 --> 10630.0
I got like he had like just insights on

10627.72 --> 10632.88
all these specialist Fields you know

10630.0 --> 10635.359
medical fields and alternative research

10632.88 --> 10637.56
thinks that before that I never really

10635.359 --> 10638.84
heard about it I would hear about in a

10637.56 --> 10641.119999999999
conversation

10638.84 --> 10644.12
somewhere but it would always be vague

10641.12 --> 10647.399000000001
but he really like introduced me to all

10644.12 --> 10650.2
these things and solidified them for me

10647.399 --> 10654.039999999999
made them available for me

10650.2 --> 10656.76
to to look into

10654.04 --> 10658.720000000001
it and it also helped me to basically

10656.76 --> 10662.68
decide like yeah I'm going to be my own

10658.72 --> 10667.039999999999
doctor like I'm not I'm deciding to

10662.68 --> 10671.0
be the the the responsible person for my

10667.04 --> 10673.880000000001
medical situation like I will never like

10671.0 --> 10676.08
oh I'm scared I have to go to somebody

10673.88 --> 10678.759999999998
else to tell me what I need to

10676.08 --> 10681.239
do it's like I'm never doing that

10678.76 --> 10684.0
anymore because I had already like

10681.239 --> 10686.039999999999
failures from doctors that just like oh

10684.0 --> 10688.6
I got this issue oh just take this yeah

10686.04 --> 10691.399000000001
it doesn't work it's gotten worse and

10688.6 --> 10693.399000000001
I'm like I had that a few times and then

10691.399 --> 10695.319
I was already like I'm not going to this

10693.399 --> 10697.0
doctor anymore it just it won't even

10695.319 --> 10699.439
admit that it didn't

10697.0 --> 10701.56
work like what kind of [ __ ] doctor

10699.439 --> 10704.56
doesn't even admit when when what they

10701.56 --> 10707.119999999999
prescribe didn't work I'm like this is

10704.56 --> 10707.119999999999
just [ __ ]

10708.239 --> 10714.92
up and then yeah much later through Alex

10712.6 --> 10717.56
Jones I I learned like wait it's not

10714.92 --> 10721.0
just my doctor apparently there's a big

10717.56 --> 10724.16
situation with the medical industry

10721.0 --> 10725.84
itself and all these vaccine scandals

10724.16 --> 10728.64
and [ __ ] and like who there's a whole

10725.84 --> 10731.16
movement against that just all of that

10728.64 --> 10737.599999999999
was introduced back

10731.16 --> 10737.6
then right in between 2006 2008 so

10751.239 --> 10755.6
much you know the guy I'm talking about

10753.399 --> 10759.278999999999
with long hair

10755.6 --> 10759.279
yeah you remember his

10776.8 --> 10782.96
name right but he was like I think the

10779.72 --> 10784.76
guy that invented a certain type of

10782.96 --> 10787.56
mixer machine

10784.76 --> 10789.880000000001
that's super

10787.56 --> 10792.239
efficient they show it too and that's

10789.88 --> 10796.039999999999
like how they made the iodine how they

10792.239 --> 10799.479
make the how they bind the iodine to the

10796.04 --> 10802.92
Glycerine which makes it so durable and

10799.479 --> 10806.0
like it doesn't just evaporate that

10802.92 --> 10808.279
way it's good absorbable like he's done

10806.0 --> 10812.76
a whole bunch of like industrial

10808.279 --> 10815.239
refining research for just medical

10812.76 --> 10818.399
supplementation he like that guy

10815.239 --> 10820.239
pioneered the development in that like

10818.399 --> 10821.8
the World

10820.239 --> 10825.84
level

10821.8 --> 10828.519999999999
like that was all new like he invented

10825.84 --> 10831.239
that method it's like they we can they

10828.52 --> 10834.68
now produce a superior quality products

10831.239 --> 10837.76
that's like never been seen before

10834.68 --> 10839.76
that's what was going on at the Alex Jon

10837.76 --> 10844.239
show and it's super fascinating he's

10839.76 --> 10847.439
like oh yeah Peak like never seen before

10844.239 --> 10850.52
quality production yeah I'm highly

10847.439 --> 10853.880000000001
fascinated by that [ __ ] so there was a

10850.52 --> 10857.239
real privilege being there learning

10853.88 --> 10857.239
about all that so early

10858.319 --> 10865.439
on those were the good days yeah I know

10861.2 --> 10868.04
BL Evolution yeah for me it was between

10865.439 --> 10870.0
2006 and still I still am still

10868.04 --> 10871.720000000001
listening but it's nothing like it used

10870.0 --> 10874.319
to

10871.72 --> 10877.64
be it's a lot of

10874.319 --> 10877.64
Recycling and

10878.8 --> 10885.96
just I don't know man it almost makes me

10883.08 --> 10888.76
choke to say that but it start to it's

10885.96 --> 10891.759999999998
starting to maneuver more

10888.76 --> 10891.76
towards

10891.8 --> 10895.278999999999
again freaking

11013.2 --> 11017.880000000001
so [ __ ] rich with that retardation

11015.8 --> 11021.399
either it's just a giant embarrassment

11017.88 --> 11021.399
for Humanity that's what it

11022.479 --> 11026.809
is

11023.66 --> 11026.809
[Music]

11043.76 --> 11047.12
we need to fix the

11048.399 --> 11055.399
homeless

11050.8 --> 11055.399
but try to help others overse

11055.439 --> 11058.439
eight

11062.08 --> 11067.84
no no no you should definitely help

11065.04 --> 11069.319000000001
yourselves first definitely and then

11067.84 --> 11072.439
when you help yourselves first guess

11069.319 --> 11074.519999999999
what happens more opportunity to make

11072.439 --> 11076.2
more food oh guess what you helped

11074.52 --> 11077.84
yourselves first so now you can produce

11076.2 --> 11081.800000000001
more food guess what you have a food

11077.84 --> 11084.439
surplus you can use food surplus to help

11081.8 --> 11087.119999999999
foreigns foreigners with 4 and eight

11084.439 --> 11090.12
yeah you help yourself

11087.12 --> 11093.279
first always help yourself

11090.12 --> 11096.0
first it's ridiculous to help somebody

11093.279 --> 11098.800000000001
else before you help yourself it's

11096.0 --> 11098.8
literally

11099.319 --> 11105.439
ridiculous I mean you be you're if you

11102.88 --> 11106.759999999998
get caught doing that somebody will take

11105.439 --> 11110.08
no

11106.76 --> 11111.800000000001
notice that is does not have your best

11110.08 --> 11113.92
interest at heart and some other will

11111.8 --> 11116.039999999999
take notice and then exploit that about

11113.92 --> 11117.76
you and they will try to make you

11116.04 --> 11120.960000000001
basically sacrifice

11117.76 --> 11124.56
yourself so that they

11120.96 --> 11126.479
can rake up a profit that that's what's

11124.56 --> 11131.319
going to happen

11126.479 --> 11134.599999999999
yeah like that foolish

11131.319 --> 11137.359
selflessness foolish selflessness is

11134.6 --> 11142.279
exploited by Grapplers they

11137.359 --> 11145.359
absolutely feel it's necessary to do

11142.279 --> 11147.6
that because they see like foolish

11145.359 --> 11150.12
selfishness as like

11147.6 --> 11151.880000000001
demonic and weirdly enough they have a

11150.12 --> 11154.880000000001
point with that it's

11151.88 --> 11154.88
complicated

11155.92 --> 11159.84
right like I'm not

11159.88 --> 11166.0
selfless I'm selfish you know why

11164.279 --> 11169.720000000001
because that's

11166.0 --> 11171.92
logical but here's the thing if you want

11169.72 --> 11175.199999999999
to be successfully selfish then you have

11171.92 --> 11175.2
to take care of others

11176.92 --> 11182.399
because how can you take care of

11179.239 --> 11184.56
yourself when when you only take care of

11182.399 --> 11186.239
yourself and then have to prevent the

11184.56 --> 11189.64
outside world

11186.239 --> 11193.279
from from getting you because you

11189.64 --> 11197.0
neglected them so much if you want to be

11193.279 --> 11198.560000000001
successfully selfish you have to take

11197.0 --> 11204.439
care of

11198.56 --> 11208.479
others for your own selfish interest

11204.439 --> 11211.0
and that's a logical Universal fact that

11208.479 --> 11213.16
does not care for

11211.0 --> 11216.16
Morality it's a

11213.16 --> 11216.16
machine

11219.52 --> 11224.68
fact it's a amoral absolute

11230.52 --> 11236.16
truth not selfish well maybe you are

11234.08 --> 11238.16
selfish I'm just saying being selfish

11236.16 --> 11242.0
isn't bad it's just when you're being

11238.16 --> 11244.52
foolishly selfish you're being selfish

11242.0 --> 11247.76
because you're like oh you're so into

11244.52 --> 11249.640000000001
you and you care so little about others

11247.76 --> 11252.92
you have so little sympathy for well

11249.64 --> 11257.239
that's just being a [ __ ] ass you're a

11252.92 --> 11259.6
fool you're gloating in your own

11257.239 --> 11260.76
stupidity you're gloating with your own

11259.6 --> 11262.56
self

11260.76 --> 11263.92
shortsightedness that's just [ __ ]

11262.56 --> 11265.359
[ __ ] that's

11263.92 --> 11269.16
foolishly

11265.359 --> 11269.16
selfish grabler

11269.8 --> 11275.438999999998
selfish

11271.8 --> 11278.64
yeah smart selfish

11275.439 --> 11281.84
is I need people around me that I can

11278.64 --> 11285.039999999999
depend on that I can build on I need to

11281.84 --> 11287.880000000001
help them I need to help the good ones

11285.04 --> 11289.960000000001
so that they can help me and we can all

11287.88 --> 11292.72
be great

11289.96 --> 11294.88
together yeah you can't be great

11292.72 --> 11297.438999999998
together if you don't surround yourself

11294.88 --> 11301.438999999998
with competent

11297.439 --> 11304.319
people you have to take care of them if

11301.439 --> 11306.880000000001
you want to be successfully selfish you

11304.319 --> 11310.199999999999
need to take care of

11306.88 --> 11311.319
others it's inevitable there's no way

11310.2 --> 11314.359
around

11311.319 --> 11317.039999999999
it so if you just are selfish because

11314.359 --> 11319.68
you just don't have natural sympathy

11317.04 --> 11322.399000000001
well then you have a problem you'll end

11319.68 --> 11325.12
up like a psychopath you know that you

11322.399 --> 11326.519999999999
should help help people but you just

11325.12 --> 11330.399000000001
don't want

11326.52 --> 11334.279
to you just don't like doing it yeah

11330.399 --> 11337.358999999999
well this guess what you're foolishly

11334.279 --> 11341.880000000001
selfish cuz you just don't want to but

11337.359 --> 11344.16
you really have to for your own

11341.88 --> 11347.96
protection so you're working against

11344.16 --> 11347.96
yourself you're foolishly

11351.92 --> 11354.92
selfish

11365.44 --> 11370.889000000001
[Music]

11367.48 --> 11370.889
[Applause]

11381.92 --> 11384.92
is

11397.04 --> 11403.880000000001
okay yeah title supplement now it's wild

11401.359 --> 11407.56
food that can eat you too alligators and

11403.88 --> 11407.56
snakes and foolish

11411.64 --> 11417.519999999999
selfishness Maybe I should just I want

11414.72 --> 11417.519999999999
to expand on

11428.68 --> 11433.279
that

11430.239 --> 11435.08
yeah I'm taking the the beasts out you

11433.279 --> 11436.960000000001
just have to watch the show to know what

11435.08 --> 11438.72
I'm talking about that's just wild food

11436.96 --> 11442.239
that can eat you

11438.72 --> 11444.84
too and foolish and effective

11442.239 --> 11444.84
selfishness

11444.96 --> 11451.8
the difference between it doesn't

11448.239 --> 11454.399
fit damn it yet Nothing fits so it's

11451.8 --> 11454.399
just going to be

11467.0 --> 11470.84
that right what do you guys think good

11469.04 --> 11474.12
titles though so

11470.84 --> 11477.56
far oh my God it's been over 3 hours

11474.12 --> 11479.52
again my show is like I mean in 20 years

11477.56 --> 11483.519999999999
I'm going to have like an 8 Hour show am

11479.52 --> 11485.359
I not at this point you guys remember

11483.52 --> 11488.68
some of you might remember how the early

11485.359 --> 11494.439
bir show used to be a onehour

11488.68 --> 11497.880000000001
show for like at least half a year maybe

11494.439 --> 11501.359
more do any of you remember that how the

11497.88 --> 11501.358999999999
early we show used to

11501.76 --> 11505.6
be a 1hour

11506.88 --> 11513.039999999999
show and then I decided like you know

11509.399 --> 11513.039999999999
what I'm going to fill it up with 2

11514.64 --> 11520.76
hours and now recently it's like

11518.319 --> 11523.16
yeah it just keeps happening it just

11520.76 --> 11525.479
keep doing these three

11523.16 --> 11528.92
hours before you know it's going to be

11525.479 --> 11531.0
like just a 24hour Arwin and then and

11528.92 --> 11535.16
then even after that it will be like

11531.0 --> 11537.2
more than 24 hours day

11535.16 --> 11539.68
yeah you're going to have some

11537.2 --> 11542.2
supplemental extra dimensional hours

11539.68 --> 11546.56
that you can only witness if

11542.2 --> 11546.560000000001
you if you like go to the Dark

11546.6 --> 11553.12
World yeah so 24-hour rwind Channel with

11551.239 --> 11555.119999999999
extra dimensional

11553.12 --> 11557.52
broadcast that's where this show is

11555.12 --> 11560.12
moving towards it might take a while

11557.52 --> 11562.68
though before you get there you probably

11560.12 --> 11564.640000000001
already have an extra hour extra

11562.68 --> 11567.0
dimensional broadcast only available to

11564.64 --> 11570.319
those that have access to the dark world

11567.0 --> 11570.319
that's already running by the

11570.72 --> 11576.96
way but that's the only way I can have

11573.2 --> 11576.960000000001
more than 24hour shows per

11591.56 --> 11594.56
day

11599.64 --> 11603.88
the company that employs a thousand

11601.92 --> 11608.04
people and they all get paid but there

11603.88 --> 11608.039999999999
is no profit would be a good

11610.2 --> 11615.560000000001
thing that

11612.04 --> 11616.399000000001
depends on whether what is done is a

11615.56 --> 11620.319
good

11616.399 --> 11623.119999999999
thing if it just created a bunch of

11620.319 --> 11625.519999999999
junk then it's not a good thing

11623.12 --> 11628.399000000001
If it creates things that will always be

11625.52 --> 11631.279
useful and durable yeah then it's a good

11628.399 --> 11633.76
thing then profit is like a bonus

11631.279 --> 11637.960000000001
potentially or not

11633.76 --> 11637.960000000001
necessary so it all depends

11644.279 --> 11651.239
I'm what do you mean co-ops are the way

11647.479 --> 11651.239
to go love food what are you talking

11651.479 --> 11654.479
about

11654.52 --> 11659.560000000001
if you do an eight hour show eight hour

11657.12 --> 11663.92
shows it means you have gone full what

11659.56 --> 11667.519999999999
he does eight hour shows really ter it

11663.92 --> 11669.439
Jesus when when does he do that don't

11667.52 --> 11672.16
tell me he does that every day I know he

11669.439 --> 11674.64
doesn't he just streams occasionally

11672.16 --> 11677.319
every few weeks you're looking at a guy

11674.64 --> 11680.439
that has an everyday live show yeah

11677.319 --> 11683.239
every day 3 hours like if this if I

11680.439 --> 11685.84
continue this longer I will have more

11683.239 --> 11687.6
live streaming hours than Owen Benjamin

11685.84 --> 11690.239
in a

11687.6 --> 11692.880000000001
day and he's already doing like three

11690.239 --> 11692.88
hours a

11697.479 --> 11705.479
day 3 to eight hours Jesus it's just way

11702.16 --> 11710.239
too long man I'm not going to do that

11705.479 --> 11710.239
like I don't want to do that it's too

11710.92 --> 11718.68
long like unless there's like guests on

11714.359 --> 11721.6

11721.6 --> 11726.92
over four hours and I got 50 for it so

11724.56 --> 11729.88

11729.88 --> 11737.399
was all worth it great show great

11734.0 --> 11737.399

it's too early for them so that that's

11833.479 --> 11836.119999999999
already kind of

11840.88 --> 11846.92
happening hey ter welcome

11844.279 --> 11851.359
back by the

11846.92 --> 11851.359
way you were gone a

11855.76 --> 11861.0
while I

11858.239 --> 11864.198999999999
think

11861.0 --> 11864.199
anyway yeah

11872.64 --> 11876.88
right any feedback by the way on

11874.6 --> 11880.68
yesterday

11876.88 --> 11883.239
show I mean we just kept on talking and

11880.68 --> 11884.84
talking and talking just never stopped

11883.239 --> 11888.198999999999
but I was kind of

11884.84 --> 11889.58
curious it has already 314 views by the

11888.199 --> 11891.12
way which is very

11889.58 --> 11894.12
[Music]

11891.12 --> 11894.12
quick

11895.08 --> 11902.8
4 hours and 26 minutes

11898.76 --> 11907.04
wow although how long how long before

11902.8 --> 11907.039999999999
freaking 4 hours will be the standard

11907.52 --> 11913.399000000001
though but I'm not I don't have

11910.92 --> 11916.04
Ambitions to do that I don't really

11913.399 --> 11918.16
necessarily want super long shows I

11916.04 --> 11921.12
think that two hours is actually a

11918.16 --> 11922.64
really good size for a

11921.12 --> 11925.319000000001
show

11922.64 --> 11928.198999999999
it's just that sometimes I start a bit

11925.319 --> 11930.198999999999
slow or something right because now it's

11928.199 --> 11931.880000000001
always so freaking hot hair when I

11930.199 --> 11935.08
normally start to show I mean between

11931.88 --> 11938.64
one and two it's barely doable it really

11935.08 --> 11941.08
is with these kind of heat it isn't so

11938.64 --> 11943.119999999999
the first period I'm just freaking slow

11941.08 --> 11946.399
just wiping the sweat off my forehead

11943.12 --> 11949.279
all the time and just not super riveting

11946.399 --> 11954.439
but then as soon as the sun goes off the

11949.279 --> 11956.0
wall after 2:00 then I suddenly start to

11954.439 --> 11959.439
like wake up a

11956.0 --> 11961.479
bit and things can get more

11959.439 --> 11964.479000000001
interesting right but that's only really

11961.479 --> 11967.76
during the summer period CU in the

11964.479 --> 11967.76
winter it isn't that

11970.92 --> 11975.960000000001
hot and I've never had issues starting

11973.68 --> 11978.92
my show with it being cold or anything

11975.96 --> 11978.919999999998
is not a problem at

11981.04 --> 11984.04
all

11984.319 --> 11990.359
right anyhow I am going to round out the

11986.84 --> 11994.52
show it's been 3 hours and 17

11990.359 --> 11996.800000000001
