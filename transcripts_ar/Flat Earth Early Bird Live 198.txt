good morning welcome to Flat Earth

43.26 --> 49.62
early-bird number 198 I'm your host

47.37 --> 51.449999999999996
Arwen and before we start the show

beautiful day compared to yesterday no

76.92 --> 86.81
chemtrails barely any clouds really hot

81.95 --> 90.03
some there is some window and it is yeah

86.81 --> 93.60000000000001
when you're when you're quartered off

90.03 --> 95.67
it's like really nice and hot what out

93.6 --> 101.97
in the open it's yeah the wind can get a

95.67 --> 110.729
bit bit fresh sorry but it's just a

101.97 --> 115.90899999999999
beautiful beautiful Wednesday 29th of

110.729 --> 119.96
May 2019 so welcome everyone

115.909 --> 123.96000000000001

tumeric coffee I got a car song a

123.96 --> 138.269
regular one and T of course so I'm gonna

130.44 --> 142.739
enjoy that right so

138.269 --> 142.739
that's first off let's use in chat

150.19 --> 152.85
okay

153.9 --> 160.12900000000002
so Obama called Daniel glass Shaw I

161.45 --> 173.04
think troll

163.89 --> 174.89999999999998
I timed them out Daniel Brendon cook

173.04 --> 183.03
good to see you drunken bullet for one

174.9 --> 187.25
one oh yeah pumpkin puffs Johnson hello

183.03 --> 194.43
Jessica righteous force good to see you

187.25 --> 199.56
bill G act dumb neoplastic tautological

194.43 --> 202.97
okay welcome back parish Mike yeah Wow

199.56 --> 209.459
31 watching incredible huh

202.97 --> 212.879
so yeah Cheers add the two unearthed

209.459 --> 217.14000000000001
episode is approaching it's gonna be

212.879 --> 219.35899999999998
Friday that's yeah unfortunately I

217.14 --> 223.26
thought first maybe I could do like the

219.359 --> 225.06
our witness on for my p1000 or p900

223.26 --> 228.35899999999998
whatever it's going to turn out to be

225.06 --> 231.75
eventually do that on the 200th episode

228.359 --> 234.419
but then yeah I realized okay that's

231.75 --> 236.669
really early it's not a good time to

234.419 --> 238.20000000000002
just get a wide panel of guests on so

236.669 --> 242.01000000000002
it's very unlikely to happen like that

238.2 --> 243.83999999999997
so instead I think looking at the

242.01 --> 246.989
schedules of everything I'm gonna aim

243.84 --> 248.03
for a Thursday evening up until the

246.989 --> 252.69
night for me

248.03 --> 255.51
because yeah there's no other particular

252.69 --> 259.199
people doing live streams during that

255.51 --> 264.03
time I think that I that I acquaint with

259.199 --> 267.3
directly so yeah I'm gonna aim for the

264.03 --> 269.4
Thursday evening and hope I have to talk

267.3 --> 271.13
to the guys first see if they actually

269.4 --> 275.69899999999996
agree to it so I'm gonna be asking them

271.13 --> 278.669
and see if we can do a night owl show

275.699 --> 282.36
night owl number three I think it's

278.669 --> 285.95
gonna be right let's see how many night

282.36 --> 285.95
owl shows did I have so far

288.07 --> 291.07
playlist

293.389 --> 302.8
huh what yeah right only two videos so

299.289 --> 306.31899999999996
it's interesting night on number three

302.8 --> 309.409
this Thursday hopefully and yeah we'll

306.319 --> 316.099
see if yeah if how far we can get

309.409 --> 319.969
I hope somewhere and yeah if it's not

316.099 --> 323.0
gonna be supreme then maybe I will have

319.969 --> 328.61
to settle for a p900 in that order we'll

323.0 --> 331.58
see but I hope people well yeah we'll

328.61 --> 334.789
trust me enough to think that it'll

331.58 --> 338.27
really matter that difference I have a

334.789 --> 341.389
very steady camera hand by the way I I

338.27 --> 344.24
hope I kind of proven that even with

341.389 --> 345.68
holding the freaking webcam like for

344.24 --> 346.669
example during their debates when

345.68 --> 349.43
there's chemtrails

346.669 --> 351.85999999999996
you know I hold that hand freakin steady

349.43 --> 355.279
and it can hold it very very damn steady

351.86 --> 359.469
for like minutes on end so I could do

355.279 --> 362.0
the same with cameras I have like

359.469 --> 367.419
motoric skills that are very suitable

362.0 --> 367.419
for camera work just I'm just saying

369.589 --> 376.239
oh hang on for the p2000 come on Ren

373.909 --> 376.239
cook

389.05 --> 395.06
so yeah I hope to see many of you then

392.09 --> 400.81899999999996
the coming Thursday if it's gonna happen

395.06 --> 402.65
I hope it will what do you think it's

400.819 --> 408.5
gonna be yeah it's gonna be the last of

402.65 --> 410.659
me oh yeah by the way also I don't know

408.5 --> 415.189
if I informed everyone of it but I have

410.659 --> 417.8
now bought a ticket to the Amsterdam

415.189 --> 422.259
conference on Saturday so I will be

417.8 --> 425.53000000000003
joining that conference on Saturday and

422.259 --> 430.46000000000004
kind of just like my show I'm literally

425.53 --> 435.59
ready on the spot for interviews even

430.46 --> 437.659
with press I think I can take that maybe

435.59 --> 440.06
not if it's totally unexpected or like

437.659 --> 442.599
I'm in the middle of like just smoked a

440.06 --> 445.279
joint and not expecting that [ __ ] I

442.599 --> 446.659
thought I might maybe I'm not gonna do

445.279 --> 448.819
that

446.659 --> 453.71
I don't know maybe I will be too excited

448.819 --> 456.77000000000004
to think about smoking joints we'll see

453.71 --> 459.169
anyway probably afterward like I had

456.77 --> 461.21
this thing arranged sort of with Dan

459.169 --> 464.839
Winfield that we were gonna hang out in

461.21 --> 465.31899999999996
Amsterdam afterwards so maybe I'll do

464.839 --> 471.139
that

465.319 --> 473.81
we'll see that that could be funny but

471.139 --> 478.389
yeah I'm really curious to basically

473.81 --> 478.389
face the people face to face and see

478.839 --> 486.139
what what they're like face to face cuz

483.71 --> 490.52
like camera to camera is still a little

486.139 --> 492.199
different because you know you're

490.52 --> 494.33
basically communicating with the other

492.199 --> 496.699
but you also know that everyone else is

494.33 --> 502.039
pretty much looking just as much with

496.699 --> 505.759
that and that tends to polish things

502.039 --> 507.71
down and you can't show everything so

505.759 --> 511.009
I'm just really curious as to who

507.71 --> 512.659
everybody really is face to face but

511.009 --> 514.099
yeah we'll see I don't know how

512.659 --> 517.599
communicative everyone's going to be

514.099 --> 517.599
with me maybe I make them nervous

518.3 --> 525.5699999999999
I don't know if that's true or maybe

522.0 --> 527.61
they think I'm just a weirdo really I

525.57 --> 534.1800000000001
wouldn't be surprised I kind of think

527.61 --> 538.6800000000001
I'm a weirdo as well but I tried to be

534.18 --> 541.3199999999999
righteous and I tried to be exemplary by

538.68 --> 543.87
the old standards gentlemen fashion

541.32 --> 546.33
basically that's what I try to do and I

543.87 --> 550.4
do officially leave a little room for

546.33 --> 554.5500000000001
some very harsh and deep expressions as

550.4 --> 558.11
like an extra on it not to be a total

554.55 --> 563.9699999999999
pacifist but as much as possible

558.11 --> 567.8100000000001
so that's how I conduct myself always on

563.97 --> 570.12
camera person to person because in a way

567.81 --> 574.1999999999999
it's weird you could consider that again

570.12 --> 577.47
weird I am a weirdo I guess I feel like

574.2 --> 580.08
whatever I'm gonna do it's gonna it's

577.47 --> 585.12
watched it's just watched I don't know

580.08 --> 589.0500000000001
maybe it's through maybe it's God that I

585.12 --> 591.93
feel is watching me maybe it is some

589.05 --> 594.5699999999999
kind of weird future and tango man maybe

591.93 --> 597.9
it's because of my my visions and it's

594.57 --> 599.88
like I feel like myself is watching from

597.9 --> 601.98
the other side something like that but

599.88 --> 606.75
I'm just always acting like yeah people

601.98 --> 610.47
are what there is no secrecy for me the

606.75 --> 614.28
only secrecy that I could ever perform

610.47 --> 616.74
would be imaginary in all honesty to

614.28 --> 621.42
myself that is literally how I conduct

616.74 --> 623.16
myself but that doesn't mean that you

621.42 --> 626.3399999999999
can just literally throw everything out

623.16 --> 630.51
there because it'll drive people some

626.34 --> 633.87
things are just like even you have to be

630.51 --> 637.02
adapted to a certain level to basically

633.87 --> 639.42
understand what I would be saying or

637.02 --> 645.89
otherwise it would be very confusing or

639.42 --> 649.56
scary or like yeah confusing mostly so

645.89 --> 651.779
you can't just say everything to the

649.56 --> 654.7199999999999
fullest of depth of what I deal

651.779 --> 656.819
in the general public but I tried to do

654.72 --> 660.4200000000001
as much as possible if I think that

656.819 --> 668.069
it'll have a constructive effect that is

660.42 --> 670.92
good it's like going into the wilderness

668.069 --> 674.7199999999999
with a lot of dangerous but with a good

670.92 --> 674.7199999999999
guide that's what I'm trying to do

676.22 --> 680.0400000000001
anyway

677.43 --> 686.7299999999999
yeah I'm getting a very metaphysical

680.04 --> 689.49
here weird but yeah looking forward to

686.73 --> 692.4590000000001
that as well the conference very curious

689.49 --> 696.3290000000001
what what yeah how it's gonna be you

692.459 --> 697.92
know I think a lot of people now really

696.329 --> 701.04
have this feel for like that

697.92 --> 703.2299999999999
like where is Flat Earth going so that

701.04 --> 706.23
is definitely something I can absolutely

703.23 --> 709.3190000000001
talk about with every individual and

706.23 --> 713.5790000000001
very curious to hear them out because I

709.319 --> 716.699
have a lot of ideas but also sometimes I

713.579 --> 718.92
underestimate the power of having so

716.699 --> 724.1099999999999
many different individuals with their

718.92 --> 727.829
own angles to things it's hard to really

724.11 --> 739.29
oversee you could yeah to structure eyes

727.829 --> 742.4899999999999
in the consequence of it I try hey Karen

739.29 --> 742.49
be good to see you

744.07 --> 753.09
[Music]

753.139 --> 762.619
yeah right yeah Jason McCormick yeah the

757.67 --> 765.3499999999999
meteors a I I don't know I don't know

762.619 --> 767.4200000000001
what freakin meteors are I don't know if

765.35 --> 769.6890000000001
be supposed meteors that NASA talks

767.42 --> 772.2199999999999
about are the same phenomena as the

769.689 --> 774.949
shooting stars that we sometimes see

772.22 --> 779.6600000000001
which are very temporary and very weird

774.949 --> 783.7389999999999
and if those two things are even the

779.66 --> 786.8589999999999
same as the actual the more bizarre

783.739 --> 790.73
phenomena off like this manganese

786.859 --> 792.889
burning up type of glittery rock

790.73 --> 794.629
sometimes ending up in an explosion that

792.889 --> 796.569
you get to see sometimes and I've seen

794.629 --> 800.66
that in person

796.569 --> 803.899
with my own eyes and the Glitter effect

800.66 --> 809.269
was pretty damn close by you could see

803.899 --> 812.149
the direct light shining off it liked it

809.269 --> 814.519
I don't know it's just it seemed very

812.149 --> 820.369
close but I could hear the glittery if

814.519 --> 824.569
it was very weird and it pretty much

820.369 --> 832.339
came down like almost perfectly natural

824.569 --> 834.769
like so I don't know what all these

832.339 --> 838.3090000000001
these three phenomena are and if they

834.769 --> 840.529
really are all the same because the

838.309 --> 843.169
falling star thing really seems to be

840.529 --> 845.749
purely celestial and consider it that

843.169 --> 849.529
the globe of the heavens may all be

845.749 --> 852.41
holographic then that may also be just a

849.529 --> 855.47
holographic side effect like a little

852.41 --> 858.3389999999999
scratch or something or like it's always

855.47 --> 862.72
also been conceptualizing like a droplet

858.339 --> 865.5790000000001
rolling off the dome like that you know

862.72 --> 868.61
you can imagine all kinds of things but

865.579 --> 872.0889999999999
if it is if all the globe of the heavens

868.61 --> 875.839
is holographic then it may just be

872.089 --> 878.899
another light side effect but yet those

875.839 --> 882.7600000000001
freaking manganese rocks just subtly

878.899 --> 886.76
literally falling down and

882.76 --> 889.01
proximity proof of that that I can't

886.76 --> 892.43
really explain where that's coming from

889.01 --> 894.83
other than yeah a kind of slightly

892.43 --> 899.4699999999999
remote conspiracy that those things may

894.83 --> 903.71
be like launched like a giant catapult

899.47 --> 905.03
maybe to kind of reinforce the belief to

903.71 --> 908.24
tie it all in together

905.03 --> 910.4599999999999
maybe that is like a secret Freemason

908.24 --> 915.11
thing that they do they just catapult

910.46 --> 917.98
manganese over al from very high or

915.11 --> 922.12
whatever throat really high burn it up

917.98 --> 924.5
ignite it at a certain point to

922.12 --> 926.45
reinforce the belief that meteors really

924.5 --> 929.21
are rocks from outer space

926.45 --> 932.9000000000001
it sounds so bizarre when I say it like

929.21 --> 936.44
that but maybe it is maybe yeah and

932.9 --> 939.7099999999999
besides it if I were a freemason that

936.44 --> 942.11
will be a really cool tradition to

939.71 --> 950.89
secretly do it's like secret fireworks

942.11 --> 950.89
hahaha I'd like it but that's just me

951.64 --> 960.92
who knows I don't know what it is but

957.23 --> 964.46
these giant rock boulders speeding

960.92 --> 969.68
you know the CGI and everything I I

964.46 --> 973.7
don't think that is any of it no it's

969.68 --> 977.03
not gonna be your there's no proof to me

973.7 --> 980.8000000000001
that there's like boulders of that kind

977.03 --> 983.92
of size that just naturally come down

980.8 --> 983.92
you know

984.31 --> 990.77
or it's well on the other hand maybe it

987.74 --> 994.66
is like a freaking weapon then if they

990.77 --> 994.66
do that III don't know

1001.73 --> 1011.24
all I'm saying is I don't think that

1006.03 --> 1015.0
literal rocks falling from somewhere are

1011.24 --> 1017.22
it's not my first jump to conclusion

1015.0 --> 1020.36
that that's completely a singular

1017.22 --> 1020.36
natural phenomena

1024.55 --> 1033.8799999999999
you know it would be really fascinating

1027.01 --> 1039.28
to for example do radar scans like a via

1033.88 --> 1041.8300000000002
radar scans on on falling stars like

1039.28 --> 1044.49
there's periods in August I think some

1041.83 --> 1048.76
regions where there it just goes and

1044.49 --> 1055.27
just freakin radar it see you know is

1048.76 --> 1057.99
that physical is there something

1055.27 --> 1057.99
physically there

1069.55 --> 1077.2
really Jason McCormick well I'd like to

1073.19 --> 1083.3500000000001
see I like to look that look over that

1077.2 --> 1089.57
like actual radar output not some yeah

1083.35 --> 1093.62
afterward diagram I'd like to see the

1089.57 --> 1096.6499999999999
actual radar output like you know the

1093.62 --> 1100.1
scan thing in them oh yeah did they

1096.65 --> 1104.69
record that while doing that the raw

1100.1 --> 1114.04
output that's what I want to see the raw

1104.69 --> 1114.04
data holy [ __ ] really one more

1114.1 --> 1117.1
Wow

1119.7 --> 1129.23
holy [ __ ] that okay oh that certainly

1126.09 --> 1129.23
complicates things

1140.07 --> 1146.87
there's some real mysteries about this

1142.32 --> 1150.48
world guys if there's like literally

1146.87 --> 1153.29
periodically which shows that there's

1150.48 --> 1156.51
something something cyclical about it

1153.29 --> 1160.4099999999999
that apparently physical things high up

1156.51 --> 1163.83
there suddenly form or recluse whatever

1160.41 --> 1167.8200000000002
you're going to be presupposing and then

1163.83 --> 1172.83
just shoot down like that pretty much

1167.82 --> 1180.99
all the same angles roughly what the

1172.83 --> 1184.1899999999998
hell is that there's some weird [ __ ]

1180.99 --> 1184.19
going on up there

1193.98 --> 1199.289
all right okay well yeah

1197.22 --> 1201.1200000000001
so for I'm basically presupposing that

1199.289 --> 1202.26
you're all saying oh yeah there is radio

1201.12 --> 1204.2399999999998
there's Ritter there's greater

1202.26 --> 1207.72
difference yeah and I like to actually

1204.24 --> 1210.45
see it first before I really go off in a

1207.72 --> 1213.539
tangent about this physical meteor

1210.45 --> 1216.799
mystery okay because I've heard ballers

1213.539 --> 1234.059
made a lot of claims very rapidly

1216.799 --> 1235.08
without actual follow-up data so okay

1234.059 --> 1242.979
Daniel

1235.08 --> 1242.9789999999998
[Music]

1264.82 --> 1275.1699999999998
okay Jesus taking long okay let's not do

1273.14 --> 1275.17
that

1282.929 --> 1288.19
that's not a falling star readout I

1286.09 --> 1291.99
don't see falling star readouts on any

1288.19 --> 1298.059
of these I see blips

1291.99 --> 1300.7
like but like the falling star what I

1298.059 --> 1304.1689999999999
specifically meant with the meteorites

1300.7 --> 1307.8400000000001
is not presuppose it rocks up there I'm

1304.169 --> 1315.46
talking about the falling stars when

1307.84 --> 1318.8799999999999
they fall they're not seeing any like in

1315.46 --> 1323.1390000000001
the general image section with radar

1318.88 --> 1329.74
measurement meteor it's yeah graphs and

1323.139 --> 1332.1299999999999
stuff but maybe even could do videos or

1329.74 --> 1332.13
something

1338.2 --> 1341.2
No

1342.24 --> 1345.2
nope

1355.899 --> 1361.7589999999998
right I thought I was pretty clear about

1358.729 --> 1364.309
this about the differentiation between

1361.759 --> 1367.3990000000001
the three type of phenomena the

1364.309 --> 1369.83
presuppose it rocks in outer space the

1367.399 --> 1372.35
actual visual phenomena of the falling

1369.83 --> 1377.239
stars and that happened periodically

1372.35 --> 1381.529
with intervals and the actual physical

1377.239 --> 1384.019
freaking glittery [ __ ] coming down and

1381.529 --> 1386.629
sometimes exploding because those are

1384.019 --> 1388.669
the three separate different phenomena

1386.629 --> 1391.519
and I was referring to the falling star

1388.669 --> 1393.47
part is that physical or is it a part of

1391.519 --> 1397.129
the globe of the heavens purely light

1393.47 --> 1399.409
based not just these presupposed rocks

1397.129 --> 1401.539
out there that are just blips that are

1399.409 --> 1403.8400000000001
hanging still they're not talking about

1401.539 --> 1403.84
those

1409.76 --> 1418.77
unicorn laser eyes no I don't have any

1414.32 --> 1422.76
guests planned I have had contact from a

1418.77 --> 1425.52
lot of people though also address the in

1422.76 --> 1429.93
calibre that I had a pretty good talk

1425.52 --> 1432.09
with on josé's so I could potentially

1429.93 --> 1434.5700000000002
invite him on the show he seems to be

1432.09 --> 1437.22
online I don't know

1434.57 --> 1442.28
and there were other people as well

1437.22 --> 1442.28
proficient pirate contacted me

1448.34 --> 1452.54
and oh yeah of course Bob of glow

1450.65 --> 1456.98
Buster's I had a very extensive

1452.54 --> 1460.31
conversation with him or rather a

1456.98 --> 1462.8600000000001
discussion about gravity where he was

1460.31 --> 1466.28
basically just echoing exactly what I

1462.86 --> 1468.6499999999999
was doing two years ago and was getting

1466.28 --> 1474.6399999999999
a bit tedious eventually to me I told

1468.65 --> 1474.64
him like let's just drop it

1477.67 --> 1483.53
but yeah he said that the early bird

1481.79 --> 1485.78
chill was a little bit too early for him

1483.53 --> 1491.6
on average so I might get him on a night

1485.78 --> 1493.82
I will show separately or maybe I'll

1491.6 --> 1496.9699999999998
have him on at the beginning of the show

1493.82 --> 1499.04
just as a one-on-one and then after that

1496.97 --> 1501.83
other people join and then maybe he

1499.04 --> 1504.86
leaves or he stays something like that I

1501.83 --> 1508.1599999999999
don't know I haven't this is still just

1504.86 --> 1511.37
an open idea about Thursday but all

1508.16 --> 1514.22
kinds of things could happen I just have

1511.37 --> 1516.53
to see whoever is available for that

1514.22 --> 1522.04
time and if they're going to agree to

1516.53 --> 1522.04
the setup that I had in mind

1522.77 --> 1527.26
[Music]

1530.62 --> 1533.8
[Music]

1536.99 --> 1540.529
[Music]

1541.43 --> 1546.3500000000001
okay let's I'm just gonna look in chat

1544.17 --> 1546.3500000000001
now

1550.99 --> 1554.49
and down there

1567.46 --> 1572.739
it

1569.739 --> 1572.739
okay

1576.19 --> 1581.47
all right yeah AJ I'm good question

1578.71 --> 1584.17
sorry I didn't see it in-between but I

1581.47 --> 1586.39
don't think I think light is not it's

1584.17 --> 1591.0
not emanating from a physical object I

1586.39 --> 1594.73
think it's basically a phenomena that

1591.0 --> 1598.75
holographically spawns like a singular

1594.73 --> 1601.09
beam at that angle in relation to the

1598.75 --> 1602.65
observer because yeah as you will as we

1601.09 --> 1608.59
all know pretty much when you go up

1602.65 --> 1610.5300000000002
there they go away so I think the stars

1608.59 --> 1614.9499999999998
are like beams of light that are just

1610.53 --> 1615.78
there when it's dark enough from a

1614.95 --> 1619.13
certain height

1615.78 --> 1619.1299999999999
[Music]

1620.01 --> 1626.32
so maybe what allows them to manifest is

1623.77 --> 1628.36
the thickness of the atmosphere caused

1626.32 --> 1629.6799999999998
it but it could just be a correlation

1628.36 --> 1631.75
because yeah we do know the atmosphere

1629.68 --> 1634.93
is lower I erupt so when you go higher

1631.75 --> 1638.5
up they go away that's an idea but it's

1634.93 --> 1640.3300000000002
just a correlation we don't really know

1638.5 --> 1642.96
what causes this light phenomena

1640.33 --> 1642.96
specifically

1649.48 --> 1658.19
yeah I'm glad you find that very amusing

1652.399 --> 1660.6789999999999
down further doesn't really matter to me

1658.19 --> 1663.38
you know like everything I've said

1660.679 --> 1664.94
everybody especially in the beginning

1663.38 --> 1667.13
was laughing their ass off remember

1664.94 --> 1670.429
remember when three years ago and chat I

1667.13 --> 1672.5
was saying the Sun is holographic the

1670.429 --> 1674.72
Sun is holographic it's not a physical

1672.5 --> 1677.289
thing at a specific location yeah

1674.72 --> 1682.88
everybody was like oh my god are we

1677.289 --> 1686.72
that's so hilarious Oh guess what guess

1682.88 --> 1689.0900000000001
what large sizable percentage of flat

1686.72 --> 1692.529
earthers now specifically embraced that

1689.09 --> 1692.529
idea hmm

1697.83 --> 1702.21
so you know

1709.56 --> 1720.54
now Karen P don't don't don't be Adele I

1716.18 --> 1723.03
wasn't I was talking mostly to done

1720.54 --> 1725.37
threader here I was basically troll

1723.03 --> 1727.52
baiting him it's just every time

1725.37 --> 1732.1799999999998
somebody starts to really like

1727.52 --> 1735.33
noticeably giggle when I mention my

1732.18 --> 1736.95
descriptions of how I conceptualize

1735.33 --> 1739.59
these things and that they just giggle

1736.95 --> 1742.53
like a little girl or something because

1739.59 --> 1744.6
they literally don't get it that's their

1742.53 --> 1746.78
response like that's when the air it's

1744.6 --> 1748.8
an air it's like I don't get it he

1746.78 --> 1754.44
embarrassment really that they don't get

1748.8 --> 1757.32
it but then they deflected and yeah

1754.44 --> 1760.91
happens a lot I've experienced that all

1757.32 --> 1760.9099999999999
throughout my life a lot

1769.81 --> 1773.4299999999998
a chocolate

1780.38 --> 1788.3090000000002
I went James didn't you also say you

1787.32 --> 1792.72
came from

1788.309 --> 1796.08
Alvin years ago from elves well yeah

1792.72 --> 1800.64
maybe although it look the Elven thing

1796.08 --> 1804.51
is more metaphorical really but yeah

1800.64 --> 1808.98
there there was like this weird natural

1804.51 --> 1811.679
dream even tied into like the dark wall

1808.98 --> 1816.84
and the other side that somehow my

1811.679 --> 1821.029
identity and my spirit is like the elves

1816.84 --> 1823.8899999999999
and that conceptualization from talking

1821.029 --> 1829.94
it hasn't it's significant importance

1823.89 --> 1835.909
with me and my mother basically yeah

1829.94 --> 1839.97
emphasize that even a little it was like

1835.909 --> 1842.88
like a noble being I liked what I had to

1839.97 --> 1845.3990000000001
be like a noble being and I want to I

1842.88 --> 1847.94
want this naturally now not saying that

1845.399 --> 1851.1299999999999
I'm not human

1847.94 --> 1856.169
although yeah because of this I don't

1851.13 --> 1858.3300000000002
know it maybe it's also just coincidence

1856.169 --> 1862.0490000000002
with with my combined genetics that I

1858.33 --> 1863.6999999999998
just happen to appear to look younger I

1862.049 --> 1866.6689999999999
guess everybody thinks I'm much younger

1863.7 --> 1868.799
than I'm really am they haven't changed

1866.669 --> 1877.2
very little in my looks except for the

1868.799 --> 1879.57
mustache and I am a youthful person just

1877.2 --> 1882.3300000000002
like my mother and that stays forever

1879.57 --> 1884.399
and you have to learn to deal with it or

1882.33 --> 1887.49
you become really annoying and

1884.399 --> 1891.3899999999999
disruptive when you get old and my

1887.49 --> 1893.72
mother kind was going that direction but

1891.39 --> 1898.95
yes

1893.72 --> 1901.919
didn't make it that far cause and that's

1898.95 --> 1904.23
a funny thing as well it's like part of

1901.919 --> 1906.179
the myth as well and I believe that in a

1904.23 --> 1908.25
way I've experienced like I'm very

1906.179 --> 1911.94
sensitive to psychosomatic

1908.25 --> 1914.97
it is like a ability that allows pretty

1911.94 --> 1917.4
magical things that seriously related

1914.97 --> 1919.71
directly what it makes me also a bit

1917.4 --> 1921.299
vulnerable and the weird thing is

1919.71 --> 1923.07
there's the saying about elves in the

1921.299 --> 1924.48
Lord of the Rings specifically mentioned

1923.07 --> 1927.0
and that is that they are technically

1924.48 --> 1932.39
immortal and they don't really age but

1927.0 --> 1932.39
if they lose the will to live they die

1932.72 --> 1941.809
and I kind of like feel like that like

1938.22 --> 1948.09
seriously if I just had a real purpose a

1941.809 --> 1952.1689999999999
hope for the world and an ability to to

1948.09 --> 1954.809
use my true powers and skills without

1952.169 --> 1955.5200000000002
having to abandon a lot of them just to

1954.809 --> 1959.82
get by

1955.52 --> 1966.9189999999999
then I might really live incredibly long

1959.82 --> 1971.58
and not aged that much by coincidence or

1966.919 --> 1977.88
maybe some mystical thing that my mother

1971.58 --> 1979.77
was engaged in I don't know or my

1977.88 --> 1982.8200000000002
grandpa you know because he was a

1979.77 --> 1987.1689999999999
freemason as well but he basically

1982.82 --> 1990.78
didn't he distanced himself completely

1987.169 --> 1993.48
from my mother's family and everything

1990.78 --> 1996.8999999999999
after a certain point and was never

1993.48 --> 1999.1200000000001
really clear why and we eventually got

1996.9 --> 2001.8500000000001
the idea was to basically protect her

1999.12 --> 2004.2199999999998
and yeah Freemason or conspiracy ideas

2001.85 --> 2006.4089999999999
that kind of did make sense and but

2004.22 --> 2008.299
makes everything extremely complicated

2006.409 --> 2011.929
my background is extremely complicated

2008.299 --> 2016.58
and I don't know everything about it

2011.929 --> 2019.549
unfortunately I don't know everything

2016.58 --> 2022.6299999999999
what my mother really was engaged in and

2019.549 --> 2022.6299999999999
she was

2022.659 --> 2032.88
a good person but she was also like very

2026.409 --> 2032.88
easily tempted by her curiosity and she

2032.97 --> 2041.94
tended to be overwhelmed by it more than

2036.45 --> 2045.6390000000001
be very strong against it although she

2041.94 --> 2048.389
she did yeah she was not so super easily

2045.639 --> 2051.49
cross he wasn't like like a gamma girl

2048.389 --> 2053.619
or whatever you're gonna call that she

2051.49 --> 2057.089
was still somewhat responsible but still

2053.619 --> 2059.98
like curiosity would like nag on her

2057.089 --> 2062.74
it was much stronger than I'd like I

2059.98 --> 2066.639
have like especially when I was young

2062.74 --> 2070.6899999999996
just morbid search curiosity but I've

2066.639 --> 2074.98
also had like a lot of Ischia I say

2070.69 --> 2078.19
confrontations with it to say the least

2074.98 --> 2080.95
and I've even tried to describe some of

2078.19 --> 2083.9500000000003
those and that kind of like made me able

2080.95 --> 2087.46
to realize the consequences of that

2083.95 --> 2089.97
curiosity but my mother I think never

2087.46 --> 2093.94
truly really learned that lesson and

2089.97 --> 2096.069
kind of was more possessed by it that

2093.94 --> 2103.05
type of person like a real typical

2096.069 --> 2105.97
liberal also naive naive believer

2103.05 --> 2107.8
because it's very hard to live in a

2105.97 --> 2110.319
world where you don't trust anything if

2107.8 --> 2118.03
you're that sensitive my mother had a

2110.319 --> 2121.14
lot of trouble that but yeah potentially

2118.03 --> 2125.349
if she would have had a good guidance

2121.14 --> 2127.7799999999997
she might have not become like this if

2125.349 --> 2134.29
she had good if her dad didn't abandon

2127.78 --> 2135.849
her after she was five then she might

2134.29 --> 2138.7
have she might still be alive

2135.849 --> 2142.48
and look just as young as me she might

2138.7 --> 2145.5
look like okay that woman is now 40 even

2142.48 --> 2148.82
though she would be deep in her 60

2145.5 --> 2153.41
sixties you know

2148.82 --> 2155.36
ah I will never know what I do know is

2153.41 --> 2158.6299999999997
that there is a chance that if I get

2155.36 --> 2161.48
kids that and this this is kind of based

2158.63 --> 2163.3
on empirical things that there is a

2161.48 --> 2166.28
chance that I might

2163.3 --> 2168.8500000000004
among those children get a daughter that

2166.28 --> 2172.2200000000003
will be very much like my mother and

2168.85 --> 2174.77
that she might actually have been

2172.22 --> 2177.08
secretly knowing this having insight

2174.77 --> 2179.21
over a reincarnation and spiritual stuff

2177.08 --> 2182.81
she was not foolish about these things

2179.21 --> 2188.2400000000002
she had a lot of Ecology she conference

2182.81 --> 2190.67
with wizards for the curiosity of it and

2188.24 --> 2191.45
I kind of dated the same thing in my own

2190.67 --> 2195.05
way

2191.45 --> 2197.39
but yeah in that very different way read

2195.05 --> 2204.65
more to be tested rather than out of

2197.39 --> 2206.87
curiosity that's come but yeah maybe

2204.65 --> 2209.08
she's waiting for that for a second

2206.87 --> 2209.08
chance

2211.73 --> 2219.589
to get a dad that's not gonna banner and

2215.869 --> 2223.599
that's gonna actually teach her to use

2219.589 --> 2232.099
all this this built-in bizarre strength

2223.599 --> 2235.52
that my that specific ancestry of mine

2232.099 --> 2239.81
that line through my grandfather and my

2235.52 --> 2242.99
mother and me if I can

2239.81 --> 2244.97
yeah properly guide a child it's gonna

2242.99 --> 2247.04
be very difficult because they're gonna

2244.97 --> 2255.109
be wielding with incredible powers

2247.04 --> 2256.94
pretty quickly as did I and like you

2255.109 --> 2259.0989999999997
have to first take it very seriously and

2256.94 --> 2261.829
thank God my mother did take that very

2259.099 --> 2266.1800000000003
seriously that helped me a lot but then

2261.829 --> 2270.44
also you have to keep on dealing with it

2266.18 --> 2272.5699999999997
in order for it to stabilize over time

2270.44 --> 2275.93
and that's like a full-time investment

2272.57 --> 2278.9
and that is originally also why I wanted

2275.93 --> 2283.25
to be like the house father with a

2278.9 --> 2285.9500000000003
career girl like my ex and then I would

2283.25 --> 2288.89
be pretty much raising the kid and

2285.95 --> 2291.1699999999996
teaching it teaching it crafts teaching

2288.89 --> 2293.5989999999997
it all kinds of things homeschool it if

2291.17 --> 2296.81
I could somehow maybe not in this

2293.599 --> 2299.75
country I don't know but that was kind

2296.81 --> 2303.77
of dia setup idea so I could properly

2299.75 --> 2306.079
guide my offspring to deal with the

2303.77 --> 2310.369
powers that are very likely to arrive in

2306.079 --> 2314.96
them give it even better guidance than I

2310.369 --> 2319.2200000000003
got and definitely a lot more experience

2314.96 --> 2323.839
because my mother was pretty fresh about

2319.22 --> 2326.47
all that in the time that I basically

2323.839 --> 2326.47
was born

2330.93 --> 2336.7799999999997
and she did learn a lot over the years

2332.91 --> 2338.85
like but when starting out it was she

2336.78 --> 2341.19
was like a total newbie with all the

2338.85 --> 2344.58
spiritual things really didn't was just

2341.19 --> 2346.86
exploring eventually I think she got a

2344.58 --> 2363.5099999999998
lot of things anyway this went totally

2346.86 --> 2365.82
ethereal here yeah so right thanks

2363.51 --> 2368.76
chocolate scene I call him bizarro

2365.82 --> 2372.8300000000004
Legolas every day yeah I guess with this

2368.76 --> 2372.8300000000004
type of talk I kind of deserve that

2390.94 --> 2399.21
no peanuts Clark I think I don't think

2394.15 --> 2401.6800000000003
so now I think you got it wrong done

2399.21 --> 2406.0
gonna be a little bit pedantic here but

2401.68 --> 2407.8289999999997
dawn is definitely not smart but that

2406.0 --> 2412.0
doesn't mean that he doesn't have wisdom

2407.829 --> 2414.369
though it's totally different he has a

2412.0 --> 2419.079
better field of things but he's not

2414.369 --> 2420.6400000000003
Smyth it's the wisdom skill not the

2419.079 --> 2424.539
intelligence it's very obvious

2420.64 --> 2427.96
intelligence spawns broad knowledge with

2424.539 --> 2429.96
detail wisdom spawns inside and field to

2427.96 --> 2433.869
things it's very different

2429.96 --> 2434.109
ha ha see done you know what I'm talking

2433.869 --> 2436.569
about

2434.109 --> 2442.0589999999997
really people just don't go there they

2436.569 --> 2449.2889999999998
just over generalize things yeah Don

2442.059 --> 2451.869
threader sure you are but generally it

2449.289 --> 2453.8190000000004
seems you you don't get very good at

2451.869 --> 2455.92
things that you're generally dealing

2453.819 --> 2459.819
with so yeah you may have learned the

2455.92 --> 2462.27
few good tricks but that doesn't make

2459.819 --> 2462.27
you smart

2490.35 --> 2499.7999999999997
it's you guys

2507.33 --> 2512.19
no no don't try there now come on you

2510.12 --> 2515.21
know better than that

2512.19 --> 2519.14
I don't judge people by by how Nathan

2515.21 --> 2519.14
designates them come on down

2524.49 --> 2538.43
but to be fair you do get really dumb

2530.099 --> 2538.4300000000003
under pressure it yeah that's just true

2546.27 --> 2550.8
but it's okay you know yeah you actually

2548.61 --> 2555.3900000000003
literally just admit to the belief of it

2550.8 --> 2559.44
you understand that part and and that's

2555.39 --> 2561.33
really respectable but of course yeah

2559.44 --> 2562.7000000000003
Nathan's not gonna respect that because

2561.33 --> 2567.42
he doesn't give a [ __ ] about

2562.7 --> 2569.7599999999998
heliocentric religion specifically

2567.42 --> 2571.91
insults that so yeah you should realize

2569.76 --> 2574.5600000000004
that even though that's a very honest

2571.91 --> 2578.0699999999997
realization of you that's not actually

2574.56 --> 2582.32
gonna help you out with something in the

2578.07 --> 2582.32
debates I'm just saying

2592.859 --> 2597.749
no--don't threader it's different

2595.38 --> 2602.2690000000002
Nathan's just not interesting and

2597.749 --> 2605.7889999999998
interested in really sharing his beliefs

2602.269 --> 2610.1899999999996
he's not as concerned with his beliefs

2605.789 --> 2610.19
as a lot of other people seem to be

2610.519 --> 2614.18
that's the difference

2619.74 --> 2626.49
Wow seems to have a lot of concave and

2622.349 --> 2628.88
thews iasts in chat or at least more

2626.49 --> 2628.8799999999997
than one

2650.94 --> 2657.61
right so yeah I'm gonna round out the

2653.74 --> 2661.06
show I think it's a little short what

2657.61 --> 2663.9
I haven't even eat even eat eating my

2661.06 --> 2663.9
croissant yet

2669.85 --> 2673.83
[Music]

2691.04 --> 2701.38
yeah chocolates saying there would be a

2696.2 --> 2701.3799999999997
weird sight like concave curvature

2718.75 --> 2728.97
I wonder though with literal concavity

2724.079 --> 2731.92
would the typical concealment effect of

2728.97 --> 2737.9199999999996
looking over straight surface occur on

2731.92 --> 2741.28
that now that's a little bit more

2737.92 --> 2747.099
difficult to test but it is interesting

2741.28 --> 2751.78
them because if that's not really

2747.099 --> 2756.04
possible you don't get any concealment

2751.78 --> 2757.8
in a concave surface then that kind of

2756.04 --> 2761.319
rules out the earth to be concave

2757.8 --> 2762.6400000000003
definitely because we do always when

2761.319 --> 2773.17
looking over the earth get the

2762.64 --> 2776.2799999999997
concealment effect so yeah sorry about

2773.17 --> 2776.28
that concave earth

2781.68 --> 2787.72
anyway I yeah I am gonna run out the

2784.15 --> 2790.6600000000003
show so thank you everyone for coming if

2787.72 --> 2792.97
