[Music]

43.84 --> 45.92
you

62.8 --> 66.64
oh

64.0 --> 67.96
good morning welcome to flat earth early

66.64 --> 71.28
bird number

67.96 --> 72.96
1263 i'm your host irwin and before we

86.08 --> 90.96
weekend please also do support me

88.96 --> 93.119
through the paypal patreon super chat

90.96 --> 96.079
and membership system join button that

93.119 --> 99.84
would be much appreciated

96.079 --> 102.15899999999999
always use it as you all know

99.84 --> 102.159
right

102.32 --> 107.75899999999999
so yeah the weather today is

105.439 --> 111.32
different

107.759 --> 111.32
it's kind of cloudy

114.479 --> 119.439
there's no like real super thick clouds

117.92 --> 121.759
yet but

119.439 --> 124.479
it is mostly clouded barely any blue in

121.759 --> 124.479
between there

125.84 --> 129.75900000000001
uh yeah also

127.6 --> 132.959
a little bit of rain here and there but

129.759 --> 132.95899999999997
just a couple of drops

134.4 --> 136.87900000000002
but uh

139.12 --> 143.44
i guess it's kind of decent enough

141.36 --> 146.16000000000003
weather i don't know i look hot it's

143.44 --> 147.28
raining actually now a little

146.16 --> 149.35999999999999
let's see it

147.28 --> 152.48
i don't know if the camp can pick up on

149.36 --> 152.48000000000002
that probably not

154.319 --> 159.51899999999998
all right mostly just cloudy

160.0 --> 167.959
ah a camera freeze

163.28 --> 167.959
when did it freeze when i put it back

175.76 --> 180.35999999999999
yeah when i put it back all right

181.64 --> 184.7
[Music]

187.92 --> 191.83999999999997
so

189.2 --> 192.95899999999997
hello psych bear first in chat daniel

191.84 --> 196.519
robles

192.959 --> 196.519
good to see you

199.92 --> 202.92
ugh

216.72 --> 220.239
gas in a bag

218.48 --> 224.07999999999998
says it had mass

220.239 --> 227.59900000000002
well doesn't the bag have mass

224.08 --> 231.12
i mean it's solid

227.599 --> 233.67999999999998
right how about that that gas without

231.12 --> 233.68
the bag

234.0 --> 237.04
right

236.0 --> 239.04
i mean

237.04 --> 243.439
the relative density is always an

239.04 --> 243.439
average right it's an average

250.159 --> 255.67999999999998
it's an average between the weight

253.439 --> 257.68
of the object

255.68 --> 259.919
and whatever it contains right the

257.68 --> 262.16
average of all that

259.919 --> 264.24
and the medium it is in

262.16 --> 268.88000000000005
so yeah

264.24 --> 271.04
it's very hard to basically isolate gas

268.88 --> 273.919
into a separate object

271.04 --> 277.84000000000003
without anything that is solid i mean

273.919 --> 279.68
well very hard it's basically impossible

277.84 --> 282.0
because it's not gonna stay cohesive

279.68 --> 284.88
it's immediately gonna spread out mix-up

282.0 --> 288.08
do all kinds of things except stay

284.88 --> 289.12
as a cohesive hole

288.08 --> 291.44
right

289.12 --> 292.72
gases don't do that i mean liquids might

291.44 --> 294.73
do that

292.72 --> 296.24
so let's do that definitely

294.73 --> 298.47900000000004
[Music]

296.24 --> 298.479
but

299.36 --> 304.08000000000004
unless it's like

300.96 --> 306.32
powder then it doesn't do it either

304.08 --> 306.32
but

307.12 --> 310.639
that's the issue with relative density

309.52 --> 313.28
if you're gonna

310.639 --> 314.8
wait yeah if you're gonna measure

313.28 --> 317.44
gases

314.8 --> 319.199
density

317.44 --> 321.84
how do you do it you can only do it by

319.199 --> 321.84000000000003
containing it

322.32 --> 327.44
and then basically

325.2 --> 329.28
[Music]

327.44 --> 332.08
yeah you just test

329.28 --> 334.15999999999997
like how dense is this

332.08 --> 336.88
like combined

334.16 --> 338.88000000000005
so you have to calculate a bit about it

336.88 --> 341.68
the combined density

338.88 --> 345.52
of the object and the gas within it

341.68 --> 348.56
versus the regular air pressure

345.52 --> 350.71999999999997
density of the air right that surrounds

348.56 --> 350.72
it

350.96 --> 357.44
that's it right

354.16 --> 359.03900000000004
yeah but without the solid to basically

357.44 --> 361.039
contain it

359.039 --> 362.4
how is it gonna how's gas gonna have

361.039 --> 363.759
mass

362.4 --> 366.31899999999996
right

363.759 --> 367.52000000000004
it really doesn't

366.319 --> 370.40000000000003
it just

367.52 --> 373.59999999999997
yeah it might be a little bit denser

370.4 --> 374.96
than the air that it is surrounded by

373.6 --> 376.72
but

374.96 --> 379.59999999999997
it's not going to be a lot

376.72 --> 381.91900000000004
and yeah it could definitely also be

379.6 --> 383.84000000000003
less and and then what you got you got

381.919 --> 385.84
anti-mass

383.84 --> 388.84
no

385.84 --> 388.84
anyway

399.199 --> 408.44
balance on a stick endpoints

403.039 --> 408.44
okay so what is your point daniel robles

413.12 --> 417.919
did did i see your comment

415.28 --> 419.039
yesterday on a response to a comment

417.919 --> 420.96
that i

419.039 --> 423.84
made somewhere

420.96 --> 423.84
was it again on

426.96 --> 433.039
yeah john thor had a video

430.4 --> 436.23999999999995
about the sun oh look its angular size

433.039 --> 438.71999999999997
is decreasing as its angular speed isn't

436.24 --> 441.36
so i yeah that entire video was about

438.72 --> 443.68
that pretty cool you know he got some

441.36 --> 446.08000000000004
good footage together

443.68 --> 448.24
it was again

446.08 --> 449.75899999999996
suggesting no it's moving into the

448.24 --> 452.639
distance oh really then where's the

449.759 --> 455.599
angular speed so perfectly consistent

452.639 --> 455.599
so no it isn't

459.039 --> 463.31899999999996
let's see if you should get me

467.039 --> 472.08
no it wasn't you by the way

469.68 --> 473.44
ryan q vinset

472.08 --> 476.919
and

473.44 --> 476.919
glenn celch

479.44 --> 484.16
this was on facebook

481.759 --> 484.16
okay

485.599 --> 488.84
bye who

494.319 --> 498.40000000000003
by the way it is saturday the 4th of

497.12 --> 501.4
june

498.4 --> 501.4
2022

504.31 --> 507.37
[Music]

539.09 --> 542.249
[Music]

544.72 --> 549.1600000000001
what you have for breakfast

549.76 --> 552.48
a croissant

553.04 --> 558.959
and some supplements that's it

557.04 --> 563.0
sometimes they just take the supplements

558.959 --> 563.0
and nothing else but

564.32 --> 568.399
i got some green tea as usual

568.56 --> 571.92
i wonder what the temperature is

572.399 --> 575.88
it's not great

577.44 --> 583.2
oh what

580.16 --> 585.519
22 degrees

583.2 --> 585.519
really

586.399 --> 590.64
huh it doesn't seem like that at all but

588.88 --> 592.88
maybe that's because there's very little

590.64 --> 592.88
sun

592.959 --> 598.6099999999999
53 humidity

595.519 --> 602.1
makes sense

598.61 --> 602.1
[Music]

619.519 --> 622.72
you got anything else

627.92 --> 633.8389999999999
or you had some kind of follow-up

630.64 --> 633.8389999999999
daniel robles

639.76 --> 643.92
anyway

641.92 --> 647.519
what was that doing yesterday flat earth

643.92 --> 649.279
debates was great was very short after

647.519 --> 652.079
show and we were all severely

649.279 --> 655.36
disappointed but what we did do was it

652.079 --> 655.3599999999999
was we were all in good

658.839 --> 662.72
form so that was great

667.68 --> 671.279
the john thor video

672.24 --> 677.92
if you should get

675.12 --> 677.92
i wish you just

678.32 --> 685.0
whenever you open a new window it muted

680.56 --> 685.0
it i think you can actually do that

688.32 --> 692.0
anyway this is that video

693.12 --> 697.92
i'm gonna find what they told me once

695.36 --> 699.76
okay just know that i can't visit

697.92 --> 702.76
facebook pages

699.76 --> 702.76
so

708.079 --> 711.56
anyway yesterday

741.04 --> 745.8
it was overall pretty calm day but

753.6 --> 758.44
like i missed dell's stream

759.44 --> 763.36
i think even with jim bob stream

761.36 --> 767.44
although no wait i didn't miss jim

763.36 --> 767.44
lovestream what was going on

770.839 --> 775.6
just i've been just watching some

773.36 --> 777.76
infowars or something

775.6 --> 780.0
playing a game but i do remember that i

777.76 --> 783.04
watched rogue one

780.0 --> 783.04
star wars movie

785.04 --> 789.36
like after that there was a lot of talk

787.279 --> 791.519
about star wars in general that day and

789.36 --> 795.12
it was thinking like yeah this is a

791.519 --> 798.88
really good movie as far as i remember

795.12 --> 802.48
i want to watch it again and yeah

798.88 --> 807.12
that was like a really spectacularly

802.48 --> 807.12
it's like star wars three and a half

809.36 --> 815.12
because it is like in star wars four

813.12 --> 817.6
basically it is the story about the

815.12 --> 820.0
bothans

817.6 --> 822.8000000000001
many bothans died to bring you this

820.0 --> 824.639
information all right from star wars

822.8 --> 829.3199999999999
four that sentence

824.639 --> 829.32
that's what this entire movie is about

831.76 --> 837.68
or at least it seems to

834.32 --> 840.639
yeah but it is yeah it literally melts

837.68 --> 843.4399999999999
into the first scene

840.639 --> 845.36
of star wars for a new hope right they

843.44 --> 848.0
make it very obvious

845.36 --> 850.0790000000001
but yeah it's it's really good movie it

848.0 --> 852.88
really did stand the test of time and it

850.079 --> 852.88
has like the

853.839 --> 860.5600000000001
the serious harshness of the empire

857.92 --> 860.56
very much

863.279 --> 868.8
right the way

865.12 --> 871.199
it was even like originally

868.8 --> 873.76
put down the image of it

871.199 --> 876.24
from the original movies

873.76 --> 878.399
and it was yeah it's a good movie anyway

876.24 --> 881.6800000000001
if you've never seen it or is like what

878.399 --> 885.839
bro one what are you talking about

881.68 --> 885.8389999999999
from 2016 or something

887.12 --> 891.04
it's really good

888.8 --> 893.279
like compared to like

891.04 --> 895.199
other movies

893.279 --> 897.4399999999999
that came out

895.199 --> 901.8389999999999
of the star wars franchise that one is

897.44 --> 901.839
actually like really good

902.48 --> 910.16
it is completely

906.16 --> 914.399
in the tradition of the style of the old

910.16 --> 916.959
no new garbage no sjw influences no

914.399 --> 918.8
creepy ass disney influence even though

916.959 --> 920.56
they are part of the movie they're like

918.8 --> 921.519
it's not there

920.56 --> 923.92
it's

921.519 --> 927.44
exactly like the old one

923.92 --> 929.92
as far as i could tell of course cgi

927.44 --> 931.1990000000001
here and there

929.92 --> 933.519
but anyway

931.199 --> 934.959
that's what i was doing that was my day

933.519 --> 937.519
on friday

934.959 --> 940.959
went to bed pretty early

937.519 --> 944.0
because i wanted to

940.959 --> 945.5999999999999
and i did an interesting like energy

944.0 --> 948.0
experience also

945.6 --> 949.6
that was really odd

948.0 --> 952.399
i was like

949.6 --> 954.399
kind of meditating dreaming or

952.399 --> 958.0
already getting to sleep and i had like

954.399 --> 958.0
a weird shockwave effect

960.079 --> 965.3599999999999
and it was so weird because i was like

962.88 --> 967.36
fully attuned to like

965.36 --> 969.04
like yeah the energy

967.36 --> 971.759
is when it happened and it it was

969.04 --> 971.759
literally like

972.48 --> 976.16
like a ripple

974.88 --> 977.12
of energy

976.16 --> 979.92
boom

977.12 --> 983.839
i literally felt it going through my

979.92 --> 983.8389999999999
head even and my body

984.72 --> 989.519
i don't remember ever having experienced

987.279 --> 989.519
that

990.88 --> 995.519
except maybe for like high peak

993.519 --> 997.6
energy moments when it was like in the

995.519 --> 999.519
middle of doing things and then i don't

997.6 --> 1001.36
really remember

999.519 --> 1003.839
but it just happened

1001.36 --> 1005.759
it felt good actually like

1003.839 --> 1008.1600000000001
i've had similar experience where it was

1005.759 --> 1009.44
actually terrible

1008.16 --> 1012.24
where it's like

1009.44 --> 1015.759
more painful like with like it takes

1012.24 --> 1015.759
away energy but it didn't do that

1018.079 --> 1022.0
so that

1020.24 --> 1023.519
for anybody

1022.0 --> 1024.66
who cares

1023.519 --> 1026.319
uh

1034.64 --> 1041.16
probably not

1037.52 --> 1041.16
a terror 306.

hmm

1080.0 --> 1085.679
yeah characteristics you told me

1083.28 --> 1090.039
but yeah that's in yeah

1085.679 --> 1090.039
hey lhd good to see you

1100.64 --> 1107.5200000000002
from baking soda vinegar can be poured

1104.48 --> 1110.4
with extinguish

1107.52 --> 1114.6399999999999
will extinguish a flame

1110.4 --> 1114.64
yeah duh because it's co2

1117.76 --> 1123.28
these are some of the heaven no no

1120.4 --> 1125.52
daniel robles that's just a baseless

1123.28 --> 1127.44
assertion

1125.52 --> 1130.24
oh look oh there's a gas it does

1127.44 --> 1131.919
something that means it has mass no it

1130.24 --> 1135.36
doesn't

1131.919 --> 1139.44
mass isn't even properly defined

1135.36 --> 1139.4399999999998
it's just a quick grab

1140.32 --> 1144.08
derivative

1141.6 --> 1144.8799999999999
it's just a numerical derivative from a

1144.08 --> 1147.1999999999998
process

1144.88 --> 1149.44
[Music]

1147.2 --> 1151.039
right you derive it

1149.44 --> 1154.16
the mass

1151.039 --> 1156.64
through its density

1154.16 --> 1159.679
and like cross-reference it it is

1156.64 --> 1162.8400000000001
cross-referenced with weight

1159.679 --> 1168.72
which applies mass

1162.84 --> 1170.3999999999999
but it doesn't actually work cohesively

1168.72 --> 1172.48
with gases

1170.4 --> 1175.1200000000001
right it's like the old yeah it's the

1172.48 --> 1177.3600000000001
newtonian dilemma again

1175.12 --> 1181.039
it's the issue with gravity and yeah

1177.36 --> 1181.039
mass which is tied in with that

1186.16 --> 1190.0800000000002
that's what they told me

1188.0 --> 1192.4
right well that what they told you makes

1190.08 --> 1194.0
no sense it's just a baseless assertion

1192.4 --> 1196.0
oh look

1194.0 --> 1198.559
you put this stuff together it makes a

1196.0 --> 1200.88
gas you can extinguish a flame with that

1198.559 --> 1202.559
that means it has mass

1200.88 --> 1204.7990000000002
what how

1202.559 --> 1207.76
what the hell does that have to do with

1204.799 --> 1210.08
mass nothing

1207.76 --> 1212.559
like the action of weighing isn't even

1210.08 --> 1212.559
applied

1212.88 --> 1216.5590000000002
serious

1214.0 --> 1219.84
makes no sense it's just a baseless

1216.559 --> 1223.6399999999999
blabber mouth assertion for idiots

1219.84 --> 1223.6399999999999
they'll buy anything

1234.559 --> 1240.24
does dry ice have mass

1238.0 --> 1243.039
uh

1240.24 --> 1245.36
well dry ice isn't that like basically

1243.039 --> 1247.039
liquid

1245.36 --> 1249.4399999999998
yeah

1247.039 --> 1250.64
when it's a liquid it has a mass that's

1249.44 --> 1253.28
right

1250.64 --> 1255.6000000000001
but then when it evaporates

1253.28 --> 1257.36
turns into a gas again yeah then it

1255.6 --> 1261.4399999999998
doesn't have a mass

1257.36 --> 1263.6
because mass is a derived concept

1261.44 --> 1266.64
from density

1263.6 --> 1267.9189999999999
material have a density like in all

1266.64 --> 1272.0
states

1267.919 --> 1274.0800000000002
but mass is a calculus derivative

1272.0 --> 1277.36
based on the weight

1274.08 --> 1281.039
the system of weight which has gravity

1277.36 --> 1282.8799999999999
the conception tied into it

1281.039 --> 1284.96
literally that's what it is every time

1282.88 --> 1288.0
somebody says mass they're basically

1284.96 --> 1290.08
whether they realize it or not invoking

1288.0 --> 1291.44
gravity

1290.08 --> 1292.559
technically

1291.44 --> 1294.799
see

1292.559 --> 1297.44
whether you're conscious of it or not

1294.799 --> 1299.52
and even the thing of like all materials

1297.44 --> 1301.52
have atomic mass

1299.52 --> 1304.72
is basically

1301.52 --> 1306.0
just kind of to push it as a conception

1304.72 --> 1309.679
through

1306.0 --> 1309.679
when all materials have density

1309.84 --> 1315.28
but the mass is just like oh this is the

1312.48 --> 1317.84
atomic mass yeah but what if that

1315.28 --> 1320.1589999999999
material is that little atom

1317.84 --> 1322.72
is in a different state oh oh oh yeah

1320.159 --> 1325.5200000000002
the actual mass becomes different then

1322.72 --> 1327.2
so even atomic mass isn't just

1325.52 --> 1330.1589999999999
the mass

1327.2 --> 1333.039
it's like this weird average soup

1330.159 --> 1334.0800000000002
calculation determiner

1333.039 --> 1336.799
right

1334.08 --> 1341.72
this is all it's more about statistics

1336.799 --> 1341.72
than actual mechanical reality

1355.12 --> 1360.08
but mass no mass is not independent of

1357.52 --> 1363.28
gravity

1360.08 --> 1366.48
the entire invocation of mass is

1363.28 --> 1369.12
intricately tied in with gravity

1366.48 --> 1371.84
just like weight

1369.12 --> 1375.1999999999998
standard weight

1371.84 --> 1377.6
now actual weight can also be

1375.2 --> 1380.559
transitioned like basically calculated

1377.6 --> 1381.6
differently by just saying like now

1380.559 --> 1384.08
weight

1381.6 --> 1386.32
is just relative density this

1384.08 --> 1389.4399999999998
equilibrium force

1386.32 --> 1393.12
put to a numerical value

1389.44 --> 1394.799
in a medium of air at ground level

1393.12 --> 1396.4799999999998
right but that's very elaborate to just

1394.799 --> 1399.6
call it weight

1396.48 --> 1399.6
is much easier

1399.84 --> 1405.28
right and yeah and then people that

1402.799 --> 1408.0
think you'll be eccentrically

1405.28 --> 1410.72
say oh yeah that's because it has a mass

1408.0 --> 1414.48
the mass makes it

1410.72 --> 1417.2
viable for gravity to be

1414.48 --> 1420.4
displaced that way

1417.2 --> 1423.6000000000001
right that's how they say it works

1420.4 --> 1426.0
unfortunately it doesn't actually work

1423.6 --> 1428.48
because it doesn't apply to gases gases

1426.0 --> 1431.279
don't mechanically function according to

1428.48 --> 1434.4
that formula it just doesn't work

1431.279 --> 1438.08
because it's all convention driven based

1434.4 --> 1438.0800000000002
on presuppositional conception

1440.72 --> 1444.039
hey richie

1465.679 --> 1471.48
oh interesting dominoid

1468.48 --> 1471.48
right

1475.12 --> 1478.76
oh double zap

1481.59 --> 1488.3999999999999
[Music]

1486.559 --> 1490.6399999999999
that's carbon dioxide then yeah of

1488.4 --> 1490.64
course

1491.919 --> 1495.2
then

1492.72 --> 1497.52
does it have volume then it has mass no

1495.2 --> 1500.52
no it doesn't

1497.52 --> 1500.52
because

1501.6 --> 1507.9189999999999
it the mass

1503.44 --> 1507.919
that will be calculated has no match

1508.08 --> 1512.72
right it doesn't match the actual

1510.159 --> 1515.8400000000001
material

1512.72 --> 1515.84
of the gas because

1515.919 --> 1522.5590000000002
the mass is derived from weighing things

1520.32 --> 1524.72
right

1522.559 --> 1527.44
but when you do that with a gas like

1524.72 --> 1529.6000000000001
it's not gonna if it's not gonna be at

1527.44 --> 1532.0800000000002
this equilibrium with the median because

1529.6 --> 1535.9189999999999
it's pretty much the same so it's not

1532.08 --> 1535.9189999999999
going to give you an honest readout

1536.32 --> 1541.2
of the or the right derivative of the

1539.2 --> 1543.679
mass it's not going to give you one it's

1541.2 --> 1546.0
going to be off because it's a gas

1543.679 --> 1548.3200000000002
and the real situation is relative

1546.0 --> 1553.32
density based not

1548.32 --> 1553.32
mass and gravity pulling that mass

1559.919 --> 1565.039
yeah carbon dioxide funnily enough when

1562.32 --> 1566.72
it is concentrated yeah it has a higher

1565.039 --> 1569.76
density

1566.72 --> 1571.76
even in expanded situation like when

1569.76 --> 1573.44
contained in a balloon it is expanded

1571.76 --> 1575.679
right the equilibrium between the

1573.44 --> 1577.52
balloon between the rubber and the

1575.679 --> 1580.5590000000002
medium it is a yeah

1577.52 --> 1582.96
so if the medium suddenly

1580.559 --> 1585.12
evacuates then the balloon will grow

1582.96 --> 1587.8400000000001
bigger because

1585.12 --> 1590.4799999999998
the gas inside still has

1587.84 --> 1591.52
flexibility in relation to the median

1590.48 --> 1593.3600000000001
right

1591.52 --> 1595.039
so it's going to average out even though

1593.36 --> 1596.84
yeah the rubber will kind of like

1595.039 --> 1598.72
compress it slightly

1596.84 --> 1600.3999999999999
more but

1598.72 --> 1602.96
yeah a balloon filled with carbon

1600.4 --> 1604.5590000000002
dioxide is

1602.96 --> 1607.2
denser

1604.559 --> 1608.799
than the air medium typically

1607.2 --> 1611.2
pretty much always so it's always going

1608.799 --> 1613.279
to fall down

1611.2 --> 1615.6000000000001
because it's denser

1613.279 --> 1617.12
right but when you put it on a scale

1615.6 --> 1619.6789999999999
then

1617.12 --> 1622.1589999999999
the weight readout

1619.679 --> 1624.799
is not going to be

1622.159 --> 1628.3200000000002
logical it's not going to be actually

1624.799 --> 1630.559
relating to the atomic assumed mass you

1628.32 --> 1630.559
see

1632.159 --> 1637.679
because that doesn't work

1634.88 --> 1637.679
with gases

1638.08 --> 1644.799
right that's why industrially gasses are

1640.96 --> 1647.8400000000001
never weighed in its gas you state right

1644.799 --> 1649.44
it's standardized you compress it into a

1647.84 --> 1651.52
liquid or whatever

1649.44 --> 1655.2
the gas is going to turn into some like

1651.52 --> 1656.399
turn weird fluid thing others even turn

1655.2 --> 1658.799
solid

1656.399 --> 1660.4799999999998
so like think co2 actually turns kind of

1658.799 --> 1662.0
solid crystal

1660.48 --> 1663.2
when you compress it

1662.0 --> 1665.84
weird

1663.2 --> 1668.0800000000002
right but then oh yeah oh now it's more

1665.84 --> 1670.799
compressed it's like a liquid or a salt

1668.08 --> 1673.6
oh yeah yeah now it has mass and that's

1670.799 --> 1677.84
going to be kind of linear

1673.6 --> 1677.84
right because it's not a gas anymore

1679.52 --> 1684.96
and besides there's a lot of it now

1682.559 --> 1687.6
so it's more reliable for

1684.96 --> 1690.64
measuring quantities then

1687.6 --> 1693.039
if it's in a gas in an expanded state

1690.64 --> 1694.64
does like what you're going to weigh of

1693.039 --> 1696.399
it supposedly

1694.64 --> 1698.0800000000002
is not going to be

1696.399 --> 1699.9189999999999
like

1698.08 --> 1703.4399999999998
it's going to be off with the actual

1699.919 --> 1707.7990000000002
atomic mass as assumed it doesn't match

1703.44 --> 1707.799
the readout's not going to be proper

1713.2 --> 1718.01
pressure and volume right

1715.679 --> 1721.279
exactly

1718.01 --> 1721.279
[Music]

1730.559 --> 1734.72
without the scuba tank there can be no

1732.48 --> 1737.919
weight right

1734.72 --> 1740.159
but even look even like a scuba tank

1737.919 --> 1742.24
that's basically been

1740.159 --> 1743.679
equalized with the pressure outside of

1742.24 --> 1747.76
it right

1743.679 --> 1750.88
well there is gas then still a little

1747.76 --> 1752.559
but there is gas in that tank right

1750.88 --> 1754.3200000000002
when you put that whole thing on the

1752.559 --> 1756.73
scale

1754.32 --> 1758.559
it's not gonna give you extra weight

1756.73 --> 1761.039
[Music]

1758.559 --> 1764.559
yeah nothing nothing

1761.039 --> 1767.279
because the gas inside is it at

1764.559 --> 1770.0
it's like density equilibrium with gas

1767.279 --> 1772.72
out yeah outside

1770.0 --> 1774.08
so it's not gonna give you a density

1772.72 --> 1776.96
offset

1774.08 --> 1777.84
at this equilibrium offset

1776.96 --> 1780.64
right

1777.84 --> 1783.9189999999999
that's why they only weigh it

1780.64 --> 1786.0
in a compressed state

1783.919 --> 1788.5590000000002
and as adam said yeah

1786.0 --> 1791.44
base they rather measure it based on

1788.559 --> 1793.6
pressure and volume

1791.44 --> 1796.159
like a standardized pressure

1793.6 --> 1801.0
and then it's like how many liters

1796.159 --> 1801.0
that's how you buy it and sell it

1803.78 --> 1806.869
[Music]

1812.72 --> 1819.44
oh then ho oh wow daniel robles so then

1816.48 --> 1822.799
how do we fix globers from

1819.44 --> 1825.3600000000001
scattergunning everything we say

1822.799 --> 1827.52
you don't they're always gonna do that

1825.36 --> 1829.6
they always have done that and it will

1827.52 --> 1830.8799999999999
always do that daniel robles you can't

1829.6 --> 1834.0
prevent

1830.88 --> 1836.72
a glober from never giving up and always

1834.0 --> 1838.96
scatter gunning you with more arguments

1836.72 --> 1841.44
to try and deplete you

1838.96 --> 1843.919
it's what they do it's how they win

1841.44 --> 1846.559
by just making everybody too tired to

1843.919 --> 1846.5590000000002
resist them

1846.96 --> 1851.6000000000001
right

1848.48 --> 1853.92
that's their trick

1851.6 --> 1857.1399999999999
they just wear you out

1853.92 --> 1857.14
[Music]

1858.32 --> 1862.1589999999999
of course there's more subjects to

1860.159 --> 1865.2
branch off into like oh what why the

1862.159 --> 1866.64
gradient why this why that what it is

1865.2 --> 1869.8400000000001
yeah yeah yeah but

1866.64 --> 1872.72
but the point is solid though

1869.84 --> 1874.559
pun intended yeah gas doesn't actually

1872.72 --> 1876.88
have mass

1874.559 --> 1879.12
it has a density

1876.88 --> 1882.3990000000001
you can't weigh it industrially they

1879.12 --> 1882.399
don't weigh it

1883.36 --> 1888.8799999999999
they measure

1885.679 --> 1891.6000000000001
the volume under standardized pressure

1888.88 --> 1892.88
and that's how they how they

1891.6 --> 1896.32
deal with it

1892.88 --> 1899.6000000000001
because it doesn't have weight like

1896.32 --> 1899.6
liquids and solids

1902.72 --> 1906.519
doesn't have that mass

1916.559 --> 1921.84
wait stuff based on air water in air

1919.12 --> 1921.84
media right

1923.919 --> 1928.48
but but that's just the the the

1926.0 --> 1931.36
numerological

1928.48 --> 1932.72
ordering right it's like the scale

1931.36 --> 1935.6789999999999
like literally

1932.72 --> 1937.3600000000001
what you said terminology so this scale

1935.679 --> 1940.0
of weight

1937.36 --> 1944.12
like a gram that's based on water and

1940.0 --> 1944.12
air medium apparently

1954.0 --> 1960.519
hello seeking star wars by the way and

1956.159 --> 1960.519
yeah sleeping warrior good to see you

1963.519 --> 1967.36
adam price cordzilla

1973.6 --> 1976.25
len lenox no i haven't watched that

1975.76 --> 1979.4
video

1976.25 --> 1979.4
[Music]

1981.44 --> 1985.88
hey stopping trafficking my rest at

2000.0 --> 2003.279
you thought the pressure grain was

2001.6 --> 2005.9189999999999
caused by well the sun

2003.279 --> 2007.679
whatever it is temperature

2005.919 --> 2009.279
right sun is

2007.679 --> 2012.72
associated with temperature daniel

2009.279 --> 2013.919
robles yeah it has an influence

2012.72 --> 2016.88
right

2013.919 --> 2016.88
but the main

2017.279 --> 2021.44
influence

2018.48 --> 2022.559
that we can derive

2021.44 --> 2024.88
is that

2022.559 --> 2026.24
the gradient is caused by temperature

2024.88 --> 2027.279
influences

2026.24 --> 2029.84
heat

2027.279 --> 2032.32
on one side cold on the other

2029.84 --> 2035.76
that's the thing that makes even gases

2032.32 --> 2035.76
gradiate naturally

2037.12 --> 2041.039
so we have somebody but why the gradient

2039.2 --> 2042.96
yeah temperature

2041.039 --> 2045.279
heat on one side cold on the other it's

2042.96 --> 2047.8400000000001
going to gradiate just like here in the

2045.279 --> 2047.84
realm

2047.919 --> 2052.2400000000002
so yeah that's the best solution to a

2050.079 --> 2053.599
scatter gunning question like that

2052.24 --> 2055.52
right

2053.599 --> 2057.2000000000003
i mean the best way to respond to

2055.52 --> 2059.919
scatter gunning

2057.2 --> 2064.0
is to basically give an answer that

2059.919 --> 2067.359
completely clarifies the entire subject

2064.0 --> 2069.52
in just one short sentence

2067.359 --> 2072.399
right so that

2069.52 --> 2074.0
there's a silence

2072.399 --> 2075.919
that it becomes obvious when they're

2074.0 --> 2077.76
scattergunning that like no you're

2075.919 --> 2080.3199999999997
actually shooting blanks and i can

2077.76 --> 2081.9190000000003
explain it quicker than you can shoot

2080.32 --> 2084.8
out your blanks

2081.919 --> 2088.44
right that's the way to truly defeat it

2084.8 --> 2088.44
nip it in the butt

2092.879 --> 2096.48
developing turbulences

2096.8 --> 2103.32
level two oh [ __ ]

2098.8 --> 2103.32
you got a category system now

2105.92 --> 2109.56
well john 925

2126.24 --> 2133.8489999999997
okay

2129.08 --> 2133.8489999999997

[Music]

2147.76 --> 2151.1600000000003
way over there

2166.96 --> 2174.4
so daniel robles are you satisfied now

2172.32 --> 2177.6800000000003
we've been able to integrate this

2174.4 --> 2177.6800000000003
knowledge that we've shared

2180.4 --> 2186.359
what

2182.72 --> 2186.359
no john 925

2190.4 --> 2196.1600000000003
what the hell are you talking about

2191.92 --> 2196.16
stephen traveling what suicide birds

2196.8 --> 2199.96

watch anything to know that you're wrong

2221.28 --> 2224.28
john925

2224.88 --> 2229.2400000000002

well

2281.68 --> 2286.96

is pretty blatantly an electromagnetic

2286.96 --> 2291.04
weapon

2288.24 --> 2291.04
situation

2291.599 --> 2295.7200000000003
they probably all got zapped

2300.64 --> 2304.72
like really badly

2303.04 --> 2306.24
that's what it looked like they all got

2304.72 --> 2308.64
shocked

2306.24 --> 2310.0789999999997
like they suddenly got jolted

2308.64 --> 2312.64
and they all just

2310.079 --> 2316.079
plummeted down

2312.64 --> 2318.0
not all of them died by the way

2316.079 --> 2319.8390000000004
but yeah that's what it looks like looks

2318.0 --> 2322.839
like it they just got

2319.839 --> 2322.839
electrocuted

2342.16 --> 2348.24
yeah john sorry but if you're gonna

2344.8 --> 2352.079
argue that rv has good points

2348.24 --> 2355.1189999999997
you're not the one to be telling anybody

2352.079 --> 2357.2000000000003

2355.119 --> 2359.52
professor dave okay

2357.2 --> 2363.4399999999996
you know what's humiliating is that you

2359.52 --> 2368.7599999999998
actually said that rv has good points

2363.44 --> 2368.76
yeah that's humiliating john 925

2403.92 --> 2408.16
that whatever you're going to be saying

2406.079 --> 2409.92

2408.16 --> 2411.92
about globe busters who's willing to

2409.92 --> 2415.76
take me up on that

2411.92 --> 2415.76
who's willing to take me up on that

2416.24 --> 2421.1189999999997
a hundred euros whatever john's gonna be

2418.96 --> 2424.56
saying about it

2421.119 --> 2427.28
not actually a good point who's willing

2424.56 --> 2427.2799999999997

even don't want you to share my show on

2573.28 --> 2576.4
facebook

2574.48 --> 2579.839
because everybody on facebook can pretty

2576.4 --> 2579.839
much go [ __ ] themselves

2580.0 --> 2585.119
it's it's a garbage can

2583.359 --> 2587.839
i don't want to have anything to do with

2585.119 --> 2590.88
it and i do not give anybody permission

2587.839 --> 2592.72
to upload my videos or my photographs or

2590.88 --> 2594.48
anything about me

2592.72 --> 2597.4399999999996

per definition

2598.49 --> 2601.6499999999996

2604.079 --> 2610.96
i mean in a forum somewhere sure

2608.72 --> 2613.9199999999996
but i don't want to be part of facebook

2610.96 --> 2615.119
ever i never wanted to be part of it i

2613.92 --> 2618.2400000000002
literally

2615.119 --> 2620.56
i threatened people over it like you're

2618.24 --> 2621.68
not gonna put that photograph on

2620.56 --> 2625.2799999999997
facebook

2621.68 --> 2625.2799999999997
like delete that right now

2631.28 --> 2635.8390000000004
now that's some time ago of course now

2633.2 --> 2637.68
it's changed and probably am here and

2635.839 --> 2640.48
there on facebook but yeah i

2637.68 --> 2642.16
specifically don't mention it because i

2640.48 --> 2645.16
don't want to have anything to do with

2642.16 --> 2645.16
it

2664.56 --> 2669.52
wow so john you think that

2667.359 --> 2671.5989999999997
whenever jared dave and bob go to

2669.52 --> 2673.52
mainstream media they look like idiots

2671.599 --> 2674.88
that's a fact

2673.52 --> 2678.48
is that

2674.88 --> 2678.48
rvs brilliant point

2686.319 --> 2689.7599999999998
i mean

2687.76 --> 2691.44
how how are you going to justify that

2689.76 --> 2694.1600000000003
statement

2691.44 --> 2696.56
why not compare them then

2694.16 --> 2700.24
to other people that also do that and

2696.56 --> 2702.839
and then let's see are they really

2700.24 --> 2705.2
such terrible media

2702.839 --> 2707.839
representatives compared to for example

2705.2 --> 2711.2799999999997
mark sargent

2707.839 --> 2711.2799999999997
or allegedly dave

2711.599 --> 2715.52
right

2713.599 --> 2717.92
how are you gonna compare that

2715.52 --> 2720.8
i mean i don't know anybody that's an

2717.92 --> 2723.76
actual genuine flat earther or even a

2720.8 --> 2727.52
pretend flat earther that isn't made to

2723.76 --> 2730.0
look like complete [ __ ] by maj3 media i

2727.52 --> 2731.28
don't know any example

2730.0 --> 2732.48
ever

2731.28 --> 2733.44
so

2732.48 --> 2735.28
why

2733.44 --> 2736.8
highlight

2735.28 --> 2741.3590000000004
these guys

2736.8 --> 2741.3590000000004
dave jaren and bob that makes no sense

2741.599 --> 2746.7200000000003
oh by the way i called it

2744.24 --> 2747.68
so whoever was willing to take my bet up

2746.72 --> 2750.0789999999997
on that

2747.68 --> 2752.56
you can donate a hundred euros to my

2750.079 --> 2752.5600000000004
paypal

2757.599 --> 2762.7200000000003
yeah rest that hell yeah dude i've been

2760.16 --> 2764.7999999999997
blocked on jaron's channel for like four

2762.72 --> 2767.1189999999997
years

2764.8 --> 2769.44
i've even emailed jared never got an

2767.119 --> 2769.44
answer

2772.8 --> 2775.17
have you ever given interviews to

2774.72 --> 2777.4399999999996
admission

2775.17 --> 2779.359
[Laughter]

2777.44 --> 2782.0
mainstream media

2779.359 --> 2783.7599999999998
like they even come close to me with a

2782.0 --> 2785.359
stick

2783.76 --> 2788.5600000000004
no

2785.359 --> 2789.839
no no like because what if i actually

2788.56 --> 2792.96
showed them

2789.839 --> 2795.359
some of the my real feelings right

2792.96 --> 2798.96
it like it's never gonna end there's

2795.359 --> 2798.96
they [ __ ] their pants

2799.76 --> 2803.8390000000004
and not just from constant sodomy

2809.44 --> 2812.319
i mean

2810.4 --> 2814.88
i'd love to try it you know because i

2812.319 --> 2817.44
would be absolutely hundred percent

2814.88 --> 2820.7200000000003
honest just like i am now

2817.44 --> 2822.88
i would be i even like show the things

2820.72 --> 2825.2
about myself that i'm embarrassed about

2822.88 --> 2827.599
like yeah i'm kind of poor

2825.2 --> 2829.9199999999996
yeah i'm on social welfare yeah i feel

2827.599 --> 2832.2400000000002
kind of isolated i have trouble even

2829.92 --> 2836.48
dealing with other people but here's the

2832.24 --> 2839.359
good side of it and i'll weave it in

2836.48 --> 2842.559
succinctly so that they can't even

2839.359 --> 2844.64
separate it they can't even isolate the

2842.559 --> 2847.599
bad parts then leave out all the

2844.64 --> 2849.52
information i'll talk to them in a way

2847.599 --> 2850.88
that they cannot

2849.52 --> 2853.359
decrypt

2850.88 --> 2856.079
what i'm saying in order to make a

2853.359 --> 2858.72
mismatch representation

2856.079 --> 2860.559
yeah

2858.72 --> 2862.72
because

2860.559 --> 2865.92
like if they have

2862.72 --> 2868.8799999999997
bad intentions i will know i will know

2865.92 --> 2871.76
before they even say a single word

2868.88 --> 2873.6800000000003
i'll know by their composure what

2871.76 --> 2876.2400000000002
they're radiating

2873.68 --> 2878.8799999999997
like how they are thinking among one

2876.24 --> 2880.5589999999997
another i will know

2878.88 --> 2883.8
i will

2880.559 --> 2883.8

3083.2 --> 3087.9199999999996
professor dave

3085.68 --> 3092.0
no but

3087.92 --> 3092.0
you're just being a wanker john

3095.359 --> 3099.5989999999997
you're kind of dumb you're an rv

3098.079 --> 3102.079
dumbass

3099.599 --> 3104.48
you think that rv actually makes good

3102.079 --> 3104.48
points

3104.96 --> 3109.2
i mean

3106.4 --> 3112.96
we've been making such points even about

3109.2 --> 3115.1189999999997
globe busters in a non-hostile way

3112.96 --> 3120.4
for quite some time over at the flat

3115.119 --> 3120.4
earth debates openly on a regular basis

3121.76 --> 3125.8390000000004
it's not

3122.839 --> 3128.48
special or insightful that rv is saying

3125.839 --> 3132.0789999999997
that and it is a universal problem it's

3128.48 --> 3136.2400000000002
not just these guys

3132.079 --> 3138.96
the media is brutal to anybody like even

3136.24 --> 3141.52
like with the beyond the curve

3138.96 --> 3143.68
yeah it was a terrible end result and

3141.52 --> 3146.319
they did kind of know it

3143.68 --> 3148.319
but they still tried their best with

3146.319 --> 3151.839
what they had available and they kind of

3148.319 --> 3156.24
like over gambled a bit

3151.839 --> 3158.0
that's not on purpose it's what happens

3156.24 --> 3160.24
and these guys just

3158.0 --> 3162.319
weren't properly prepared for the

3160.24 --> 3163.9199999999996
psychological warfare they were going to

3162.319 --> 3166.16
face because

3163.92 --> 3168.64
yeah

3166.16 --> 3171.44
i mean if you think facing anti-flat

3168.64 --> 3172.48
earthers stuff media is just downright

3171.44 --> 3173.599
evil

3172.48 --> 3177.16
like

3173.599 --> 3177.1600000000003
really bad

3186.96 --> 3191.28
so saying glow busters represents flat

3189.28 --> 3193.92
earth good and well

3191.28 --> 3196.7200000000003
yeah unfortunately they do represent

3193.92 --> 3198.319
pretty well what a big chunk of flat

3196.72 --> 3201.2799999999997
earthers are like

3198.319 --> 3203.359
which is kind of gullible

3201.28 --> 3206.1600000000003
cultish

3203.359 --> 3208.7999999999997
just want to have a new nasa

3206.16 --> 3212.64
yeah they do actually represent that

3208.8 --> 3212.6400000000003
they're not representing me though

3216.96 --> 3220.839
i mean i can represent myself a lot

3219.76 --> 3223.599
better than

3220.839 --> 3225.839
that right but

3223.599 --> 3227.839
most people i have seen that have gone

3225.839 --> 3231.119
up to the mainstream media it doesn't

3227.839 --> 3233.52
suffice it's not good

3231.119 --> 3236.1600000000003
because the mainstream media cuts out

3233.52 --> 3239.28
the good parts and leaves the [ __ ] they

3236.16 --> 3240.7999999999997
always do that with flat earthers

3239.28 --> 3243.2000000000003
and there's really nothing you can do

3240.8 --> 3243.2000000000003
about it

3243.68 --> 3248.48
right i mean just compare other

3245.76 --> 3248.48
interviews

3248.64 --> 3253.839
and there's problems there's always

3252.319 --> 3256.64
problems

3253.839 --> 3258.7999999999997
i mean find me the perfect flat earth in

3256.64 --> 3261.7599999999998
the mainstream interview just

3258.8 --> 3264.1600000000003
name one one interview ever

3261.76 --> 3266.96
of like the thousands of flat earthers

3264.16 --> 3268.0789999999997
out there that may have potentially done

3266.96 --> 3269.52
show me

3268.079 --> 3272.319
one

3269.52 --> 3273.68
one mainstream interview that is

3272.319 --> 3275.119
actually good

3273.68 --> 3276.96
there isn't any

3275.119 --> 3280.4
there is zero

3276.96 --> 3281.52
you know why because they don't allow

3280.4 --> 3284.559
that

3281.52 --> 3285.7599999999998
to come forth in media

3284.559 --> 3287.599
on the bigger

3285.76 --> 3288.7990000000004
on the bigger platform they don't allow

3287.599 --> 3290.96
that

3288.799 --> 3292.88
it just doesn't come through

3290.96 --> 3295.44
i mean plenty of good

3292.88 --> 3296.6400000000003
videos like on people's private channels

3295.44 --> 3297.52
and all that

3296.64 --> 3300.24
right

3297.52 --> 3303.44
i mean even like annoying people has

3300.24 --> 3305.359
sometimes have pretty good videos

3303.44 --> 3308.64
sometimes

3305.359 --> 3310.24
sometimes they never have good but yeah

3308.64 --> 3313.2
the point is

3310.24 --> 3315.7599999999998
to say oh these people are specifically

3313.2 --> 3317.7599999999998
making flat earth look bad because of

3315.76 --> 3321.8390000000004
the mainstream activity that they've

3317.76 --> 3324.4
done oh really so name me a single time

3321.839 --> 3327.2
where anybody else has ever done a

3324.4 --> 3331.119
really good interview that wasn't

3327.2 --> 3334.24
somehow hijacked or half erased

3331.119 --> 3339.119
or just like the weird parts highlighted

3334.24 --> 3341.52
right like even with with allegedly dave

3339.119 --> 3344.0
they they let the full thing on why

3341.52 --> 3347.04
because he was unapologetically

3344.0 --> 3348.4
introducing like urine therapy

3347.04 --> 3350.96
and that's like

3348.4 --> 3352.96
i'm sorry whatever you think it is super

3350.96 --> 3356.2400000000002
gross so they just like

3352.96 --> 3358.16
here you go there's your flat earther he

3356.24 --> 3359.359
drinks his own

3358.16 --> 3362.8799999999997
yeah

3359.359 --> 3364.72
so name me one one one good interview

3362.88 --> 3368.2400000000002
that does not have something that's

3364.72 --> 3368.24
completely [ __ ] up like that

3369.119 --> 3373.359
nathan's interview with vice was pretty

3371.04 --> 3375.359
good i thought

3373.359 --> 3377.839
was not perfect though

3375.359 --> 3380.319
and they did cut things out of there

3377.839 --> 3382.72
yeah it was not perfect

3380.319 --> 3385.04
but it is

3382.72 --> 3385.7599999999998
one of the yeah

3385.04 --> 3388.96
the

3385.76 --> 3392.88
slightly better ones i agree

3388.96 --> 3396.799
but still like it's not perfect there's

3392.88 --> 3396.799
oh they always do it

3396.88 --> 3401.92
but yeah i remember that one with vice

3399.44 --> 3404.799
with nate yeah that is actually maybe

3401.92 --> 3406.48
one of the exceptions

3404.799 --> 3409.839
i don't know i'd have to watch it back

3406.48 --> 3409.839
it's like years ago now

3412.559 --> 3417.2000000000003
not really mainstream you could argue

3414.24 --> 3420.16
their cloak right

3417.2 --> 3420.16
see so it's like

3425.44 --> 3430.48
yeah no [ __ ] bj i seen it

3428.079 --> 3433.8390000000004
i'm not very happy with it either i'm

3430.48 --> 3437.92
just saying

3433.839 --> 3437.92
you don't know any good ones

3438.799 --> 3444.4
except maybe nathan going on vice but

3440.96 --> 3447.76
vice even isn't really mainstream

3444.4 --> 3449.76
right is gordzilla just elaborated upon

3447.76 --> 3452.48
so

3449.76 --> 3456.3190000000004
it's just like my my argument stands

3452.48 --> 3459.28
with john 925

3456.319 --> 3462.24
rv does not have good arguments and i

3459.28 --> 3463.52
literally elaborated why

3462.24 --> 3467.7599999999998
he doesn't

3463.52 --> 3469.839
but john 925 still thinks

3467.76 --> 3473.7200000000003
that yeah

3469.839 --> 3473.72
he's still doubling down

3484.799 --> 3491.2
ice still has a

3488.079 --> 3493.04
tv cable right but it is like a local

3491.2 --> 3495.52
thing though bobby steals it's like

3493.04 --> 3499.72
local tv it's not like they're it's not

3495.52 --> 3499.72
like bbc level or anything

3515.68 --> 3518.319
right anyway

3518.559 --> 3523.4
i think i made my point pretty well

3549.119 --> 3553.76
it is mainstream in macedonia huh

3555.599 --> 3559.839
right that matrix dude

3560.48 --> 3564.799
i'm sorry but

3562.079 --> 3567.28
can we round out the point or are you

3564.799 --> 3568.72
now gonna scatter gun like a baller over

3567.28 --> 3570.7200000000003
this john

3568.72 --> 3572.8799999999997
i mean i think i made my point pretty

3570.72 --> 3575.5989999999997
clear yeah

3572.88 --> 3577.04
to say oh

3575.599 --> 3579.04
dave

3577.04 --> 3581.839
jaren and bob

3579.04 --> 3584.799
are on purpose making flat earth look

3581.839 --> 3587.44
bad yeah there's no real good examples

3584.799 --> 3590.88
when that doesn't happen though

3587.44 --> 3592.96
maybe nathan oakley's vice performance

3590.88 --> 3594.079
is an exception

3592.96 --> 3598.2400000000002
but

3594.079 --> 3598.2400000000002
in my memory it was not perfect

3599.839 --> 3604.48
it was just like huh

3602.0 --> 3604.48
all right

3604.88 --> 3610.559
i don't know i'd have to watch it back

3607.359 --> 3613.92
my point is is that it to that rv is

3610.559 --> 3614.88
just drama seeking it's not a good point

3613.92 --> 3618.88
rv

3614.88 --> 3621.839
never makes good points you see

3618.88 --> 3624.48
and anybody that was on that bandwagon

3621.839 --> 3627.119
is starting to feel more and more like a

3624.48 --> 3629.119
[ __ ] which they should because they

3627.119 --> 3630.6400000000003
are if they think that rv makes good

3629.119 --> 3632.799
points ever

3630.64 --> 3636.0
he doesn't

3632.799 --> 3637.28
he just takes you on gamma inward spiral

3636.0 --> 3639.92
fests

3637.28 --> 3642.92
until you become paranoid idiotic like

3639.92 --> 3642.92
him

3644.27 --> 3647.36
[Music]

3658.16 --> 3662.96
yeah and i remember oh everybody

3660.24 --> 3666.24
praising rv like freaking nathan even

3662.96 --> 3668.079
praised him okay

3666.24 --> 3669.68
he's trying to slither his way out of

3668.079 --> 3673.28
that one

3669.68 --> 3675.44
but i'd never praise freaking rv i hated

3673.28 --> 3678.0
that guy from the start like everything

3675.44 --> 3680.48
about him was just [ __ ] offensive and

3678.0 --> 3683.68
gamma and like all his points he makes

3680.48 --> 3686.88
are just never honest it's always just

3683.68 --> 3688.96
gamma always every [ __ ] thing he does

3686.88 --> 3690.559
i can't stand the guy

3688.96 --> 3691.68
never watch the video that i could

3690.559 --> 3694.559
endure

3691.68 --> 3696.72
ever in like seven years

3694.559 --> 3699.8390000000004
ever

3696.72 --> 3699.839
this all sucks

3700.23 --> 3706.0
[Music]

3702.4 --> 3707.92
the only good sort of good rv videos

3706.0 --> 3710.24
that have ever seen from like his

3707.92 --> 3712.88
channel are the ones where he shuts the

3710.24 --> 3715.0389999999998
[ __ ] up and doesn't get involved just

3712.88 --> 3716.7200000000003
basically upload somebody else's video

3715.039 --> 3717.92
those are the good ones the ones he

3716.72 --> 3719.93
isn't in

3717.92 --> 3723.84
because he sucks

3719.93 --> 3723.8399999999997
[Music]

3738.16 --> 3743.7599999999998
yeah you better retract that it's

3740.319 --> 3743.7599999999998
getting kind of gross

3744.24 --> 3747.24
uh

3758.559 --> 3763.3590000000004
are you so emotional about this because

3760.799 --> 3766.64
rv is a freaking

3763.359 --> 3769.68
cia plant

3766.64 --> 3772.16
or maybe not he's probably not see he's

3769.68 --> 3775.2
probably a freaking ca puppet

3772.16 --> 3775.2
he's being played

3777.359 --> 3780.88
and he's just going with it

3779.68 --> 3784.48
the guy

3780.88 --> 3787.119
dude yeah i have i have no proof

3784.48 --> 3790.64
but i can feel things about him that

3787.119 --> 3793.28
will be revealed over time

i cannot offer you anything but just

3793.28 --> 3799.119

3844.319 --> 3848.16

3845.92 --> 3849.2000000000003
embarrassing and geeky when you think

3848.16 --> 3851.2799999999997
about it

3849.2 --> 3852.3999999999996

not do that

3893.28 --> 3898.2400000000002
rv has no arms in the face the rasta hat

3896.24 --> 3900.8799999999997

wow that's a crazy idea but yeah we've

3903.92 --> 3909.28
nobody's ever seen him

3906.559 --> 3911.44
so it could be anything

3909.28 --> 3914.96
that's that he could be any any kind of

3911.44 --> 3917.599
person all we know about him is his

3914.96 --> 3919.839
voice that's it

3917.599 --> 3920.839
yeah

3919.839 --> 3922.4
it could be

3920.839 --> 3925.52
anything

3927.76 --> 3933.3590000000004
it that far i mean a guy's character

3930.319 --> 3936.7599999999998
being absolutely atrocious is bad enough

3933.359 --> 3936.7599999999998
as it is

3940.319 --> 3943.319
uh

3950.559 --> 3956.96
what jord what do you do i have no idea

3954.079 --> 3959.599
where are you getting that from i i to

3956.96 --> 3960.88
be fair i don't really even care

3959.599 --> 3963.2000000000003
i mean

3960.88 --> 3965.839
i think the best defense

3963.2 --> 3968.8799999999997
would be to absolutely give him the

3965.839 --> 3971.7599999999998
amish treatment and never get caught up

3968.88 --> 3974.88
watching his garbage ever again

3971.76 --> 3976.6400000000003
and you'll be better for it you will i

3974.88 --> 3979.839
promise you

3976.64 --> 3979.839
arwenian promise

3990.16 --> 3998.199
wow

4001.36 --> 4005.81
[Music]

4013.64 --> 4016.739
[Music]

4039.039 --> 4045.599
it's what was that no that's just gamma

4042.96 --> 4047.92
[ __ ] i mean they keep like profile

4045.599 --> 4050.079
records of everything i've said

4047.92 --> 4052.319
including like weird more personal

4050.079 --> 4054.88
things so they have like a database of

4052.319 --> 4057.359
what they think is like black mailable

4054.88 --> 4062.0
information even though i am

4057.359 --> 4064.319
very much honest about these things

4062.0 --> 4067.359
right and then they think that oh we're

4064.319 --> 4068.4
just going to insert that to try to like

4067.359 --> 4071.0389999999998
throw

4068.4 --> 4072.1600000000003
poisonous bombs in the middle of like if

4071.039 --> 4074.079
the flow

4072.16 --> 4076.0
when we are cohesive right when we're

4074.079 --> 4077.599
actually agreeing and the energy gets

4076.0 --> 4079.359
thrown that's when they throw like these

4077.599 --> 4081.839
poisonous bombs in

4079.359 --> 4084.16
because they they really

4081.839 --> 4086.5589999999997
really hate me because they're probably

4084.16 --> 4086.5589999999997
gay

4087.119 --> 4092.48
and they can't stand what i do

4090.64 --> 4096.4
against that

4092.48 --> 4096.4
with all honesty right

4097.44 --> 4102.08
if i ever dated a woman who believes in

4099.679 --> 4102.08
fe

4103.759 --> 4106.0
nope

4113.6 --> 4118.56
that's the ones okay tony that's a funny

4117.12 --> 4120.4
image

4118.56 --> 4123.88
but i think you're giving him too much

4120.4 --> 4123.879999999999
credit though

4137.6 --> 4142.400000000001
i mean he's really not even that good of

4139.52 --> 4144.719
a wizard he's just like a gamma

4142.4 --> 4146.719
order right

4144.719 --> 4148.719
he collects gammas

4146.719 --> 4152.88
like a lot of

4148.719 --> 4152.88
yeah people out there do unfortunately

4153.839 --> 4157.44
but i just call them gamma collectors

4155.759 --> 4159.279
it's just like

4157.44 --> 4161.2789999999995
ips

4159.279 --> 4163.759
that guy

4161.279 --> 4165.279
remember that you too it was like a

4163.759 --> 4168.08
gamma collector

4165.279 --> 4169.6
it's just oh i'm i'm the best oh i'm so

4168.08 --> 4171.04
good

4169.6 --> 4174.159000000001
and just like

4171.04 --> 4176.48
like yeah go my wolves tear the place

4174.159 --> 4176.48
apart

4176.56 --> 4181.04
that's what gamma collectors do they

4178.64 --> 4182.08
they collect people that just want to

4181.04 --> 4184.719
attack

4182.08 --> 4188.48
and then send them like yeah attack that

4184.719 --> 4190.4
and people have their busy therapy where

4188.48 --> 4194.32
they can feel like yeah i'm attacking

4190.4 --> 4195.599999999999
the lawyers lawyers like [ __ ] retards

4194.32 --> 4198.159
yeah

4195.6 --> 4200.08
like orcs

4198.159 --> 4201.839999999999
that's how that works that's what

4200.08 --> 4203.92
salvagne's

4201.84 --> 4206.719
and what rv does

4203.92 --> 4210.32
what eric debay used to do i don't think

4206.719 --> 4212.719
he does that anymore though i'm not sure

4210.32 --> 4215.599999999999
but we're not like getting

4212.719 --> 4218.8
trolled by like eric dube people or

4215.6 --> 4220.96
anything anymore so maybe like all those

4218.8 --> 4222.400000000001
creeps that were first hang around maybe

4220.96 --> 4225.04
they've all just

4222.4 --> 4226.879999999999
joined with rv or something i don't know

4225.04 --> 4231.56
because i think eric dubay is actually

4226.88 --> 4231.56
like becoming a better man over time

4232.0 --> 4236.56
i have no direct

4234.0 --> 4240.0
evidence for that except for well the

4236.56 --> 4242.400000000001
videos that he uploads and like

4240.0 --> 4245.199
i feel it's getting better like he's

4242.4 --> 4248.32
he's like he's really doing his best

4245.199 --> 4248.32
eric dubay i think

4252.08 --> 4257.76
he's trying to be an actual good guy

4255.44 --> 4261.839999999999
and it did it wasn't as much like that

4257.76 --> 4264.8
he used to be like much more savonier

4261.84 --> 4267.84
right much more snidey and like uh there

4264.8 --> 4269.4400000000005
are shiz it doesn't seem to be like that

4267.84 --> 4271.28
now

4269.44 --> 4274.0
or is it just me

4271.28 --> 4276.32
is it just me or has eric debay actually

4274.0 --> 4280.4
improved over time like that and like

4276.32 --> 4280.4
lost some of his poisonous weights

4283.28 --> 4286.4
just keep it simple yeah but that's good

4285.679 --> 4290.159
right

4286.4 --> 4292.639999999999
there's a need for that as well like i

4290.159 --> 4294.159
i'm not like that but there's a lot of

4292.64 --> 4297.12
people

4294.159 --> 4299.36
for which that really helps

4297.12 --> 4301.84
right people that don't necessarily want

4299.36 --> 4305.36
to become specialists they just want to

4301.84 --> 4305.360000000001
know some good arguments

4310.56 --> 4315.1990000000005
yeah divergent i think so too and i'm

4312.96 --> 4317.76
very happy about that

4315.199 --> 4321.96
i kind of like eric debay more now than

4317.76 --> 4321.96
i did say five years ago

4329.12 --> 4334.96
right and and in the same time

4332.239 --> 4337.04
i used to kind of think like rv and eric

4334.96 --> 4338.88
tobay were like brothers or something

4337.04 --> 4340.32
because they had like

4338.88 --> 4341.4400000000005
equal

4340.32 --> 4343.84
type of

4341.44 --> 4347.12
code of conduct

4343.84 --> 4349.52
but rv actually grew only worse and

4347.12 --> 4351.5199999999995
worse and worse into turn basically into

4349.52 --> 4354.56
like a grappler while eric today is

4351.52 --> 4356.56
actually kind of grown and

4354.56 --> 4358.080000000001
just like

4356.56 --> 4361.76
really found

4358.08 --> 4361.76
yeah a better way of doing things

4366.719 --> 4372.96
right yeah and look at the beginning he

4369.04 --> 4377.12
was really all about chills and [ __ ] so

4372.96 --> 4381.04
don't over idealize territ 306

4377.12 --> 4383.599999999999
he was safanye he did like send like

4381.04 --> 4385.44
even encourage people like oh like these

4383.6 --> 4387.120000000001
people have to be taking down their

4385.44 --> 4390.0
fakers and

4387.12 --> 4391.84
right it was kind of paranoid not too

4390.0 --> 4393.44
great with the judgment of what other

4391.84 --> 4396.08
people are doing

4393.44 --> 4399.08
but he's gotten a lot better at it it's

4396.08 --> 4399.08
noticeable

4402.87 --> 4406.83
[Music]

4407.44 --> 4412.36
once

4408.4 --> 4412.36
pissing yourself laughing

4412.96 --> 4415.12
okay

4413.92 --> 4416.4
i'm glad

4415.12 --> 4417.679
i'm glad

4416.4 --> 4420.239
something

4417.679 --> 4422.96
was i funny again without noticing

4420.239 --> 4426.839999999999
it happens i guess

4422.96 --> 4426.84
but i'm glad you're amused

4437.28 --> 4441.04
yeah

4439.28 --> 4443.44
have i ever directly talked to eric

4441.04 --> 4443.44
dubay

4445.52 --> 4451.360000000001
i don't think so maybe like one time but

4449.28 --> 4453.679
it was very early and it would have been

4451.36 --> 4455.92
like just a few words and i would

4453.679 --> 4459.92
probably be very shy

4455.92 --> 4461.76
i'm not sure if i i'm not sure

4459.92 --> 4463.36
maybe one time

4461.76 --> 4464.8
but that would have been quite some time

4463.36 --> 4468.799999999999
ago

4464.8 --> 4469.6
even before the flatter talks or yeah

4468.8 --> 4472.2390000000005
no

4469.6 --> 4473.92
during the flatter talk somewhere maybe

4472.239 --> 4477.639999999999
i'm not sure

4473.92 --> 4477.64
quite some time ago

4482.08 --> 4486.32
but i did actually also like kind of go

4485.199 --> 4488.48
after him

4486.32 --> 4490.4
for a while i was very crit during the

4488.48 --> 4492.959999999999
flatter talks i was

4490.4 --> 4495.12
like i thought eric dube was sending

4492.96 --> 4497.679
trolls after me okay

4495.12 --> 4500.0
literally

4497.679 --> 4503.04
i had savoniay trolls

4500.0 --> 4506.08
like in 2016 and 70.

4503.04 --> 4508.239
so i was like pretty harsh towards eric

4506.08 --> 4510.719
at the start because i just thought like

4508.239 --> 4511.919999999999
dude you are like making everything

4510.719 --> 4514.4
worse

4511.92 --> 4516.56
stop doing this

4514.4 --> 4519.04
well it seems like he has kind of

4516.56 --> 4523.080000000001
stopped doing that so i'm very happy

4519.04 --> 4523.08
about that very relieved

4524.45 --> 4527.63
[Music]

4543.52 --> 4547.76
yeah yeah yeah anti-flat earth is

4545.36 --> 4550.96
freaking can't stand him

4547.76 --> 4550.96
like they really yeah

4551.76 --> 4555.84
so that's yeah that's all it's all good

4553.84 --> 4558.08
eric dubay is pretty good i'm still

4555.84 --> 4560.08
subscribed to him i do check out his

4558.08 --> 4562.64
videos it's not

4560.08 --> 4563.679
super high tech maybe on my level with

4562.64 --> 4566.56
everything

4563.679 --> 4569.1990000000005
but it is improving and he's also

4566.56 --> 4571.4400000000005
improving just

4569.199 --> 4572.879999999999
like the quality of what he does

4571.44 --> 4574.799999999999
speaking

4572.88 --> 4576.88
his vernacular

4574.8 --> 4579.1990000000005
his pronunciation

4576.88 --> 4580.56
he's improving all kinds of things about

4579.199 --> 4584.4
what he does

4580.56 --> 4584.400000000001
and yeah that's to be commended

4586.32 --> 4591.679
i will always

4588.159 --> 4593.28
like respect if a person has like skill

4591.679 --> 4594.4800000000005
that they're developing

4593.28 --> 4597.92
and i can

4594.48 --> 4600.08
i can detect yeah i can sense that like

4597.92 --> 4601.84
derive that from their work i will

4600.08 --> 4603.76
always give respect for them even if i

4601.84 --> 4607.56
like really don't like something about

4603.76 --> 4607.56
what they do you know

4613.12 --> 4615.76
what about you

4614.56 --> 4618.88
were

4615.76 --> 4620.88
where are you on that what list what

4618.88 --> 4623.88

4701.12 --> 4707.5199999999995
magic mushroom christmas by eric debate

4704.719 --> 4708.8
no i haven't everybody's done some weird

4707.52 --> 4711.360000000001
[ __ ] dude

4708.8 --> 4714.320000000001
like in the past he had some weird sort

4711.36 --> 4716.4
of gay videos even it's like dude what

4714.32 --> 4716.4
the

4717.6 --> 4722.400000000001
nothing to overtly well

4720.8 --> 4724.88
i don't know

4722.4 --> 4726.5599999999995
whatever is in the past is in the past i

4724.88 --> 4729.28
don't think he will ever do something

4726.56 --> 4731.360000000001
like that again he does he has learned a

4729.28 --> 4733.199
lot

4731.36 --> 4736.799999999999
right about just

4733.199 --> 4736.799999999999
consequence of doing things so

4738.0 --> 4743.04
but magic mushroom christmas i don't

4740.32 --> 4743.04
remember it

4746.48 --> 4750.718999999999
but i was like into like christmas and

4749.12 --> 4752.0
mushrooms

4750.719 --> 4752.8
being like

4752.0 --> 4754.96
like

4752.8 --> 4756.400000000001
santa claus actually being a mushroom

4754.96 --> 4757.199
and

4756.4 --> 4759.12
yeah

4757.199 --> 4764.719
i was in that like even during that time

4759.12 --> 4764.719
when zeitgeist came out like decades ago

4765.679 --> 4768.96
remember that

4766.96 --> 4771.76
like parallel to zeitgeist there was

4768.96 --> 4773.92
this other movie documentary type movie

4771.76 --> 4775.280000000001
where it was like all about mushrooms

4773.92 --> 4777.6
and that like everything is actually a

4775.28 --> 4779.28
mushroom it's all about secret of the

4777.6 --> 4781.52
magic mushroom and

4779.28 --> 4783.199
like the pope is actually a mushroom and

4781.52 --> 4785.92
santa claus is a mushroom and it's

4783.199 --> 4788.48
everything is a mushroom

4785.92 --> 4790.4
i love that [ __ ] it was hilarious it

4788.48 --> 4792.5599999999995
didn't actually make me take mushrooms

4790.4 --> 4795.04
by the way but i thought there was

4792.56 --> 4796.080000000001
something really interesting about it

4795.04 --> 4798.64
and

4796.08 --> 4802.12
potentially partially truthful not

4798.64 --> 4802.12
everything though

4807.6 --> 4811.84
but i do know that there is a very

4809.28 --> 4811.84
distinct

4812.0 --> 4818.639
relation between like magic mushrooms

4816.159 --> 4820.5599999999995
and christmas and that it was apparently

4818.639 --> 4823.76
a pagan tradition

4820.56 --> 4825.4400000000005
that the the like the the treats in the

4823.76 --> 4828.08
tree

4825.44 --> 4830.799999999999
they didn't used to be like cookies and

4828.08 --> 4833.28
chocolate they used to be actual

4830.8 --> 4834.719
like hallucinogenic mushrooms and then

4833.28 --> 4837.759999999999
like

4834.719 --> 4839.6
people would be tripping balls

4837.76 --> 4841.76
during christmas

4839.6 --> 4843.6
which is like kind of dangerous because

4841.76 --> 4845.280000000001
of like the energies that are in the air

4843.6 --> 4847.84
during that phase

4845.28 --> 4850.159
and then like freaky things could happen

4847.84 --> 4853.04
like the devil could literally make a

4850.159 --> 4855.759999999999
visit and weird [ __ ] would happen

4853.04 --> 4860.719
potentially dangerous [ __ ]

4855.76 --> 4863.360000000001
right that's how i imagine kind of

4860.719 --> 4865.679
the origin of it all and then like the

4863.36 --> 4868.32
catholic church kind of like turned it

4865.679 --> 4869.6
into christmas and then

4868.32 --> 4871.759999999999
it all

4869.6 --> 4873.4400000000005
just kind of mixed up and

4871.76 --> 4875.4400000000005
was forgotten

4873.44 --> 4878.4
but it's still like a quote in the bible

4875.44 --> 4879.919999999999
by jesus like don't was it from jesus it

4878.4 --> 4882.08
should be

4879.92 --> 4883.28
anyway it is in the bible if i remember

4882.08 --> 4885.92
correctly

4883.28 --> 4885.92
like don't

4886.159 --> 4890.96
eat like don't cut down the tree put

4888.8 --> 4893.679
them in your house and don't eat the

4890.96 --> 4895.84
treats or something

4893.679 --> 4898.4800000000005
and i think personally that that was

4895.84 --> 4901.4400000000005
specifically aimed at like

4898.48 --> 4903.36
like dude that's dangerous don't do use

4901.44 --> 4905.5199999999995
the hello synergetics but if you just

4903.36 --> 4907.36
say like oh don't use the hellogenic

4905.52 --> 4909.280000000001
mushrooms then yeah people are gonna

4907.36 --> 4910.799999999999
like what what's a hella synergetic

4909.28 --> 4912.4
mushroom

4910.8 --> 4914.719
and then suddenly they're gonna be like

4912.4 --> 4917.36
oh what magic my oh [ __ ]

4914.719 --> 4919.04
right it's uh so they just said just

4917.36 --> 4921.839999999999
just don't eat that

4919.04 --> 4924.56
just that's bad christ doesn't want you

4921.84 --> 4926.8
to eat that they're not gonna tell you

4924.56 --> 4927.92
why or what that is it's just like don't

4926.8 --> 4929.679
do that

4927.92 --> 4931.6
because if they tell you why then some

4929.679 --> 4933.6
people might get curious and then start

4931.6 --> 4936.719
doing it right

4933.6 --> 4936.719
that would make sense to me

4939.52 --> 4944.88
you want to start posting links to my

4941.44 --> 4947.5199999999995
show in the show and okay sure just

4944.88 --> 4951.2390000000005
don't do it on facebook divergent droid

4947.52 --> 4951.2390000000005
and everything is cool

4960.88 --> 4964.159000000001
i ever done mushrooms

4964.239 --> 4967.28
not consciously

4971.44 --> 4974.879999999999
it could be that maybe at one point i

4974.0 --> 4976.48
was

4974.88 --> 4977.36
like

4976.48 --> 4979.36
fed

4977.36 --> 4982.5599999999995
that or something

4979.36 --> 4982.5599999999995
i don't remember man

4983.28 --> 4988.239
but i've never been like i mean you it's

4985.84 --> 4989.679
not even difficult i mean it's almost

4988.239 --> 4991.5199999999995
legal here

4989.679 --> 4993.6
in the netherlands it's not that tough

4991.52 --> 4995.679
to get

4993.6 --> 4997.84
i just was always like no

4995.679 --> 5002.639
no i'm gonna stick to

4997.84 --> 5002.639
cannabis and beer that's it

5002.96 --> 5007.28
yeah thanks tony whitcomb for link

5010.96 --> 5014.08
i mean i'm not

5012.48 --> 5017.678999999999
against

5014.08 --> 5017.679
mushrooms i just think that

5017.92 --> 5022.4800000000005
it's not something that should be like

5020.48 --> 5026.199
it normalized

5022.48 --> 5026.199
absolutely not

5029.76 --> 5034.4800000000005
it should only be there for those that

5031.92 --> 5035.6
just naturally could have a benefit from

5034.48 --> 5037.5199999999995
that

5035.6 --> 5039.4400000000005
and that's going to be specific types of

5037.52 --> 5041.6
people

5039.44 --> 5042.96
not the majority

5041.6 --> 5045.92
it's not going to be good for the

5042.96 --> 5045.92
majority i think

5051.44 --> 5056.839999999999
jeremiah 10 2 4 thanks adam

5070.159 --> 5075.599999999999
right yes like they do hallucinogenics

5073.199 --> 5077.36
do open you up to the spiritual realm

5075.6 --> 5079.76
and then you're going to be facing what

5077.36 --> 5082.239
you have right so

5079.76 --> 5083.280000000001
what it basically does is

5082.239 --> 5086.48
hyper

5083.28 --> 5088.5599999999995
force you to confront your inner issues

5086.48 --> 5090.159
like even if you hide it from yourself

5088.56 --> 5092.56
then it's gonna reveal like whatever

5090.159 --> 5095.5199999999995
you're denying or hiding from yourself

5092.56 --> 5097.04
or some impulse you don't even realize

5095.52 --> 5098.719
is evil

5097.04 --> 5100.4
because that can happen you can have an

5098.719 --> 5102.8
impulse and it might actually turn out

5100.4 --> 5105.28
to be evil but you just don't feel that

5102.8 --> 5108.08
it is if you don't recognize it well you

5105.28 --> 5109.759999999999
will be confronted

5108.08 --> 5112.48
with that sort of thing

5109.76 --> 5114.8
so if there's something on your heart

5112.48 --> 5116.959999999999
or in the back of your mind guess what's

5114.8 --> 5119.1990000000005
gonna pay you a visit

5116.96 --> 5121.52
yeah and that can be

5119.199 --> 5125.599999999999
potentially dangerous because what if

5121.52 --> 5127.84
you have like room real [ __ ] up [ __ ]

5125.6 --> 5127.84
right

5127.92 --> 5131.92
that requires a much more powerful

5130.159 --> 5135.759999999999
approach and then suddenly it's

5131.92 --> 5138.08
unleashed uncontrollably right that's

5135.76 --> 5138.08
dude

5138.159 --> 5142.159
you need to be very conscious

5140.48 --> 5144.4
in my

5142.159 --> 5144.4
yeah

5144.719 --> 5149.679
in my shamanistic opinion

5147.36 --> 5151.679
i guess in my wizard opinion you need to

5149.679 --> 5153.28
be very conscious

5151.679 --> 5155.4400000000005
and like

5153.28 --> 5157.679
a bit learn it about

5155.44 --> 5159.759999999999
things like mushrooms before you even

5157.679 --> 5162.4
consider

5159.76 --> 5165.92
getting involved with that

5162.4 --> 5167.839999999999
it's not a [ __ ] party drug

5165.92 --> 5170.639
if you do it like that

5167.84 --> 5170.639
you're screwed

5172.4 --> 5176.12
it's gonna go wrong

5186.48 --> 5193.839999999999
right to me i consider it kind of sacred

5190.32 --> 5196.159
and and in that i resonate a lot

5193.84 --> 5198.88
with yeah what is it like the certain

5196.159 --> 5201.5199999999995
native american culture in which they

5198.88 --> 5204.719
use like it use cacti and things

5201.52 --> 5208.400000000001
religiously then because i respect like

5204.719 --> 5210.4
i agree i agree

5208.4 --> 5212.638999999999
it is sacred

5210.4 --> 5214.5599999999995
it's not just oh that's party oh i want

5212.639 --> 5217.76
to see some special thing

5214.56 --> 5220.0
no that's [ __ ] insane you're dealing

5217.76 --> 5222.0
with like sacred

5220.0 --> 5225.04
spirit things here

5222.0 --> 5225.84
like ancient and just deeper and it's

5225.04 --> 5227.5199999999995
not

5225.84 --> 5228.96
meant to just like

5227.52 --> 5231.040000000001
chug

5228.96 --> 5233.36
so you could have like oh i would have a

5231.04 --> 5236.4
special moment no

5233.36 --> 5239.839999999999
it's not like that it should be treated

5236.4 --> 5239.839999999999
very carefully and with respect

5244.239 --> 5247.678999999999
yes

5245.28 --> 5249.36
rest ahead we know micro dosing and all

5247.679 --> 5250.4
that

5249.36 --> 5252.799999999999
yeah

5250.4 --> 5254.5599999999995
you can do that seems to work out for

5252.8 --> 5257.12
you fine

5254.56 --> 5260.88
i'm just saying it should not be

5257.12 --> 5263.5199999999995
standardized it should not be normalized

5260.88 --> 5265.36
because it's some people it's just gonna

5263.52 --> 5268.8
[ __ ] them up

5265.36 --> 5271.12
right and besides you're very studied

5268.8 --> 5273.360000000001
you're not some idiot that just thought

5271.12 --> 5275.92
oh i'm just gonna take this

5273.36 --> 5278.08
no you you studied into it

5275.92 --> 5280.96
you learned about like the the more

5278.08 --> 5282.4
pharmaceutical aspects like the way the

5280.96 --> 5284.4800000000005
amounts

5282.4 --> 5288.0
the facts you studied into it before you

5284.48 --> 5290.4
started that right that's

5288.0 --> 5292.4
a responsible way to use it

5290.4 --> 5294.96
because you don't think of it as a just

5292.4 --> 5297.599999999999
a party drug you take the influences

5294.96 --> 5298.4
seriously that's that and i can respect

5297.6 --> 5302.77
that

5298.4 --> 5305.949
i just don't really want to do that

5302.77 --> 5305.9490000000005
[Music]

5314.96 --> 5317.96
okay

5329.6 --> 5335.120000000001
now i know rest at but even in micro

5332.239 --> 5337.44
dosing like oh oh you

5335.12 --> 5340.5599999999995
this last dad this that

5337.44 --> 5343.44
it still counts right

5340.56 --> 5343.4400000000005
it still counts

5345.36 --> 5349.44
it should be taken for like all

5347.239 --> 5351.839999999999
hallucinogenics should be taken very

5349.44 --> 5351.839999999999
serious

5352.159 --> 5355.839999999999
and maybe it would be better in general

5354.639 --> 5358.08
if like

5355.84 --> 5360.4800000000005
any sort of drugs would be taken a

5358.08 --> 5363.6
little bit more serious like i take

5360.48 --> 5365.28
tobacco and cannabis very serious

5363.6 --> 5368.320000000001
every time i realized like that's a

5365.28 --> 5370.4
tobacco plant that comes from like

5368.32 --> 5372.32
native america and

5370.4 --> 5373.759999999999
like they really use it as sacred

5372.32 --> 5375.759999999999
rituals and

5373.76 --> 5377.76
and cannabis it's like kind of they do

5375.76 --> 5379.04
there's an entire religion around

5377.76 --> 5381.360000000001
cannabis

5379.04 --> 5384.719
rastafarianism

5381.36 --> 5385.92
and i kind of respect that right so it's

5384.719 --> 5389.679
just like

5385.92 --> 5392.0
just don't see it as some stuff

5389.679 --> 5395.6
right to see it as what it really is

5392.0 --> 5395.6
where it comes from what it means

5396.159 --> 5399.199
be respectful

5399.52 --> 5404.329000000001
right

5401.22 --> 5404.329000000001
[Music]

5411.84 --> 5416.2390000000005
it's also why i like blueberry so much

5415.199 --> 5419.36
because

5416.239 --> 5421.5199999999995
that's that's the spirit that

5419.36 --> 5424.639
where they dealt with it

5421.52 --> 5427.52
was like that it's all about respect

5424.639 --> 5430.159000000001
respect for for what it is what it could

5427.52 --> 5432.159000000001
do to you and the ancient spirits the

5430.159 --> 5434.799999999999
experience and the shared experience and

5432.159 --> 5438.0
all these magical elements about our

5434.8 --> 5440.56
inner spiritual world and all that

5438.0 --> 5444.56
it's not a joke

5440.56 --> 5444.56
and i really like that about blueberry

5445.52 --> 5449.84
did you by the way watch it too rest

5447.36 --> 5449.839999999999
ahead

5450.32 --> 5454.32
i mean i think that movie would be

5451.92 --> 5458.17
pretty cool it would be a pretty cool

5454.32 --> 5461.849999999999
watch for you and desi

[Music]

5469.12 --> 5472.12
hmm

5480.08 --> 5484.4
what movie i didn't hear you blueberry

5483.12 --> 5487.04
dude i've been

5484.4 --> 5488.32
blabbering on by about that for like two

5487.04 --> 5491.84
weeks now

5488.32 --> 5491.84
blueberry 2004

5495.76 --> 5498.96
you got to watch it dude

5499.84 --> 5505.12
like especially you rastad

5503.199 --> 5506.239
because

5505.12 --> 5510.69
yeah

5506.239 --> 5513.75
i know you'd really appreciate it

5510.69 --> 5513.75
[Music]

5533.76 --> 5536.320000000001
genre

5543.76 --> 5548.159000000001
yeah it's also called renegade but it's

5546.08 --> 5549.6
it's really blueberry

5548.159 --> 5552.159
just

5549.6 --> 5554.719
making things confusing

5552.159 --> 5556.159
but here this is it

5554.719 --> 5558.32
yeah it is

5556.159 --> 5560.32
it is like a

5558.32 --> 5562.639
romanticized

5560.32 --> 5565.679
yeah it's like a european type

5562.639 --> 5568.400000000001
romanticized western it's not about

5565.679 --> 5572.08
locations it's not about people being

5568.4 --> 5575.12
bad asses like tombstone right

5572.08 --> 5578.5599999999995
it's nothing historical it's all very

5575.12 --> 5580.96
spiritual very about personal journey

5578.56 --> 5583.04
and the spirit and

5580.96 --> 5586.159
native american

5583.04 --> 5587.12
lore and legend and yeah just just watch

5586.159 --> 5589.5199999999995
it

5587.12 --> 5590.32
it's a really good movie it has like the

5589.52 --> 5593.52
best

5590.32 --> 5595.599999999999
scenery i've ever seen in a movie

5593.52 --> 5597.52
all non-cgi

5595.6 --> 5600.320000000001
except for like the hallucination stuff

5597.52 --> 5603.84
it's obviously cgi but

5600.32 --> 5603.84
like the landscapes are amazing

5603.92 --> 5608.719
stop talking about it and eat them

5605.52 --> 5608.719
already all right all right

5609.12 --> 5613.92
there you go

5611.6 --> 5617.4800000000005
blueberries

5613.92 --> 5617.4800000000005
they're a bit old

5635.36 --> 5640.0
right and even my freaking healer

5637.44 --> 5642.799999999999
approved that movie or rather his guide

5640.0 --> 5644.96
approved it which is very odd

5642.8 --> 5648.320000000001
that's not what i really expected but it

5644.96 --> 5649.679
did happen so this movie is good it's a

5648.32 --> 5653.5199999999995
good movie

5649.679 --> 5653.52
good spirited movie pure

5654.0 --> 5660.56
not polluted not politicized in any way

5657.76 --> 5663.1990000000005
and that's extremely unique

5660.56 --> 5666.639
i mean there aren't any of that type of

5663.199 --> 5666.638999999999
movie out there it just isn't

5666.67 --> 5669.92
[Music]

5670.239 --> 5673.639999999999
blueberries are very good for you yeah i

5671.76 --> 5675.92
know

5673.64 --> 5677.76
[Music]

5675.92 --> 5680.719
i love to seeing the royals getting

5677.76 --> 5680.719
booed on jubilee

5682.239 --> 5687.199
i'm so embarrassed

5684.159 --> 5689.04
that my freaking supposed king of the

5687.199 --> 5691.44
netherlands is actually at freaking

5689.04 --> 5693.92
bilderberg

5691.44 --> 5696.0
at this point i can't believe it well i

5693.92 --> 5698.639
should believe it but i just i'm so

5696.0 --> 5698.639
disappointed

5698.96 --> 5702.96
i really thought that they'd have like

5703.04 --> 5707.5199999999995
a better

5705.04 --> 5709.29
approach to all of this but apparently

5707.52 --> 5715.4400000000005
they didn't

5709.29 --> 5718.4
[Music]

5715.44 --> 5720.32
just looked it up okay cool rest at

5718.4 --> 5721.759999999999
make sure

5720.32 --> 5723.28
you got

5721.76 --> 5724.400000000001
subtitles

5723.28 --> 5726.96
because

5724.4 --> 5729.44
it's not a fully english spoken movie

5726.96 --> 5731.52
there's a lot of native american talk i

5729.44 --> 5733.199
don't know which type like never owned

5731.52 --> 5735.1990000000005
or what whatever type of i don't know

5733.199 --> 5737.599999999999
what it is

5735.199 --> 5740.48
but it doesn't have like english

5737.6 --> 5742.4800000000005
subtitles in the movie

5740.48 --> 5744.48
you have to have separate subtitles it's

5742.48 --> 5746.0
a weird issue right if you look it up on

5744.48 --> 5748.159
youtube you're not gonna find that

5746.0 --> 5750.56
version i guarantee it you're not gonna

5748.159 --> 5752.799999999999
find it you have to download it

5750.56 --> 5754.21
you have to find a good version with a

5752.8 --> 5757.31
subtitle

5754.21 --> 5757.31
[Music]

5773.52 --> 5777.52
right

5775.76 --> 5783.0
personally i think the movie is very

5777.52 --> 5783.0
much worth like buying a dvd of it

5784.08 --> 5786.32
have

5795.28 --> 5800.0
in 2006

5797.76 --> 5802.8
already it's that old

5800.0 --> 5804.08
2004 it's just such a great movie and

5802.8 --> 5807.04
like

5804.08 --> 5810.48
it's really good to have the actual dvd

5807.04 --> 5811.36
because the menu is fantastic i i just

5810.48 --> 5813.28
like

5811.36 --> 5815.839999999999
i have the dvd right in there now

5813.28 --> 5817.92
because i just like to start up the menu

5815.84 --> 5819.84
music because it's awesome

5817.92 --> 5821.4400000000005
i sometimes do that now before the show

5819.84 --> 5824.159000000001
because i just like listening to the

5821.44 --> 5824.159
menu music

5824.48 --> 5830.678999999999
but yeah if you get a dvd

5827.76 --> 5832.88
it's gonna have like subtitles which are

5830.679 --> 5835.1990000000005
incredibly useful

5832.88 --> 5836.719
for this movie you need it right so this

5835.199 --> 5839.839999999999
is one of those movies where you

5836.719 --> 5842.159
actually do want the dvd or blu-ray it

5839.84 --> 5844.88
does even exist

5842.159 --> 5847.199
and not just all the just downloaded on

5844.88 --> 5850.08
your youtube because they're not gonna

5847.199 --> 5851.759999999999
have the subtitles

5850.08 --> 5853.92
and like

5851.76 --> 5856.08
there are no subtitles for the language

5853.92 --> 5858.56
the native language that is spoken like

5856.08 --> 5861.44
they don't exist they're not

5858.56 --> 5863.280000000001
google doesn't know that language

5861.44 --> 5865.119
it's not giving you a translation and

5863.28 --> 5867.28
that's just it i don't even know if it's

5865.119 --> 5869.839999999999
a real language i think it should be but

5867.28 --> 5869.84
i'm not sure

5882.8 --> 5887.0
have you ever been no

5896.159 --> 5901.92
yeah that's right you seen it it's it's

5898.159 --> 5903.92
not typical western western is like

5901.92 --> 5906.88
the scenery

5903.92 --> 5908.8
it is the setting for the story

5906.88 --> 5912.400000000001
right

5908.8 --> 5913.52
but it's like not historical at all

5912.4 --> 5915.679
it is

5913.52 --> 5916.8
a fantasy story

5915.679 --> 5917.6
in

5916.8 --> 5920.08
a

5917.6 --> 5923.08
american kind of southern western

5920.08 --> 5923.08
setting

5924.08 --> 5929.119
like it could be california it could be

5926.239 --> 5930.959999999999
texas i don't know

5929.119 --> 5934.159
they don't say

5930.96 --> 5936.56
there's like no state names

5934.159 --> 5936.5599999999995
nothing

5937.04 --> 5940.56
right the best you're gonna get i was

5938.4 --> 5943.04
like oh that guy is from prussia

5940.56 --> 5946.159000000001
apparently that guy

5943.04 --> 5947.28
is oh he's from louisiana so that's like

5946.159 --> 5949.839999999999
french

5947.28 --> 5952.159
right so i don't know where maybe they

5949.84 --> 5955.119000000001
do say like it's like new mexico or

5952.159 --> 5957.679
something i don't know but it's all just

5955.119 --> 5959.119
not historical it's not about that at

5957.679 --> 5961.28
all

5959.119 --> 5963.5199999999995
right like so many other westerns are

5961.28 --> 5967.759999999999
it's all like oh

5963.52 --> 5969.84
details right with the historical texts

5967.76 --> 5971.119000000001
like no this movie doesn't give a [ __ ]

5969.84 --> 5973.1990000000005
about that

5971.119 --> 5977.599999999999
it's all about story and it's all about

5973.199 --> 5980.638999999999
the experience and the beauty of nature

5977.6 --> 5982.639
they really have a lot of great

5980.639 --> 5985.4400000000005
views

5982.639 --> 5989.6
and music to a company it's just it's

5985.44 --> 5989.599999999999
yeah it's like a giant ride

5990.88 --> 5993.1990000000005
anyway

5993.44 --> 5997.919999999999
it's worth watching

5995.04 --> 6000.32
but don't overwatch it

5997.92 --> 6002.4800000000005
just like watch it

6000.32 --> 6005.119
dream about it

6002.48 --> 6006.959999999999
then make sure you don't lose it that's

6005.119 --> 6009.28
why it's gonna have a dvd

6006.96 --> 6011.199
just put it in the back and then like in

6009.28 --> 6013.28
five years she'll bump into it again and

6011.199 --> 6015.599999999999
be like whoa what's this

6013.28 --> 6017.44
wait i remember that actually being

6015.6 --> 6019.92
really good let's watch it and you'll be

6017.44 --> 6022.48
like whoa damn

6019.92 --> 6025.04
again it's like every time i watch it

6022.48 --> 6027.36
it's like holy [ __ ]

6025.04 --> 6030.08
this is really good it's like it's

6027.36 --> 6031.839999999999
getting better over time compared to

6030.08 --> 6034.0
like other movies

6031.84 --> 6035.92
and like things coming out like if you

6034.0 --> 6037.199
compare this movie to like what's on

6035.92 --> 6039.84
netflix

6037.199 --> 6042.5599999999995
you'll like feel like the blueberry is

6039.84 --> 6045.4400000000005
just another world

6042.56 --> 6048.4800000000005
like it's so distant

6045.44 --> 6050.5599999999995
everything is so natural

6048.48 --> 6051.839999999999
so unquestioning

6050.56 --> 6054.2390000000005
so

6051.84 --> 6055.84
non-political it's just unbelievable

6054.239 --> 6058.799999999999
compared to like what

6055.84 --> 6061.04
movies and such are like now

6058.8 --> 6064.56
anyway

6061.04 --> 6067.199
sorry for gushing on about that again

6064.56 --> 6069.360000000001
just think it's a really good movie

6067.199 --> 6070.96
and it's the time it's the time now

6069.36 --> 6073.679
because now

6070.96 --> 6076.159
you will be able to recognize it for

6073.679 --> 6077.9
what it is compared to other media of

6076.159 --> 6080.95
this time much more

6077.9 --> 6080.95
[Music]

6082.639 --> 6086.400000000001
should i finish yellowstone first

6088.159 --> 6090.4
what

6091.119 --> 6096.08
i don't know i've never seen yellowstone

6093.84 --> 6098.4800000000005
i hear it's kinda cool

6096.08 --> 6101.199
i don't think it's gonna matter

6098.48 --> 6105.199
you probably better finish that up first

6101.199 --> 6110.0
because if you're already deep into like

6105.199 --> 6110.0
that then it's just probably gonna make

6110.719 --> 6115.28
make it stand out how it's not really

6112.719 --> 6115.28
about that

6116.96 --> 6119.96
anyway

6128.639 --> 6131.76
hey gaining wisdom

6133.119 --> 6137.239
it's all nonsense though

6170.52 --> 6175.679
[Music]

6173.44 --> 6176.19
okay cyber

6175.679 --> 6179.3
fine

6176.19 --> 6179.299999999999
[Music]

6181.679 --> 6184.92
i'm good

6220.0 --> 6224.719
we're gonna order blueberry ah good for

6221.84 --> 6224.719
you tony whitcomb

6230.0 --> 6235.92
why not stream the movie in discord for

6233.04 --> 6235.92
a movie night

6236.0 --> 6241.52
because i only have dutch subtitles

6238.4 --> 6241.5199999999995
definitely right

6243.28 --> 6247.84
i don't actually have the english

6244.88 --> 6247.84
subtitles

6263.36 --> 6268.48
interesting though i guess that is you

6265.36 --> 6271.199
could do that like on discord just show

6268.48 --> 6271.199
like a movie

6271.6 --> 6274.6
interesting

6298.96 --> 6304.2390000000005
yes movies has it with english so okay

6307.679 --> 6312.0
well if you already know how to do why

6309.679 --> 6314.08
why should i have to

6312.0 --> 6316.48
organize that i mean

6314.08 --> 6318.239
what's stopping you from watching it it

6316.48 --> 6320.0
seems like you've already watched it why

6318.239 --> 6322.239
else would you even know they did have

6320.0 --> 6322.239
that

6328.639 --> 6336.8
if you want you can if it fits in a chat

6333.36 --> 6336.799999999999
you can post a link to that

6338.159 --> 6341.5599999999995
if it fits

6344.32 --> 6347.599999999999
you just looked it up okay

6348.639 --> 6353.76
yeah i typically i don't

6351.119 --> 6355.759999999999
i don't like those types of sites

6353.76 --> 6357.4400000000005
like those quick spawn up oh we have all

6355.76 --> 6359.52
the movies and then it just because they

6357.44 --> 6362.48
always get destroyed again

6359.52 --> 6365.4400000000005
i don't like doing that also like you

6362.48 --> 6366.959999999999
can't really you don't know what they do

6365.44 --> 6368.96
up there

6366.96 --> 6373.32
right you don't know with these websites

6368.96 --> 6373.32
like what are these types of websites

6373.84 --> 6377.679
it is a place where you could

6375.199 --> 6380.239
potentially like

6377.679 --> 6384.28
yeah catch computer viruses and [ __ ] so

6380.239 --> 6384.28
i just don't do that

6387.52 --> 6392.400000000001
you have to use it oh god

6391.36 --> 6394.239
thanks

6392.4 --> 6397.599999999999

hmm

6458.4 --> 6464.239

6460.719 --> 6464.2390000000005
gonna remove that link though

6465.679 --> 6471.159
youtube might very much take offense to

6468.159 --> 6471.159
that

6471.679 --> 6477.6
good point i haven't thought of that

6474.56 --> 6481.360000000001
oh goody now i can't do it

6477.6 --> 6481.360000000001
oh brilliant youtube

6481.84 --> 6485.08
the [ __ ]

6487.04 --> 6491.6
okay divergent droid could you please

6489.119 --> 6494.159
remove the link

6491.6 --> 6496.2390000000005
that you posted

6494.159 --> 6499.599999999999
i can't do it even though i'm the

6496.239 --> 6501.5199999999995
channel owner makes no what the hell is

6499.6 --> 6504.719
going on with the freaking moderation

6501.52 --> 6506.8
system these days i don't get it

6504.719 --> 6509.679
they screwed it up again

6506.8 --> 6511.28
it was working like perfectly now so

6509.679 --> 6513.84
weird

6511.28 --> 6515.84
now if you ban somebody you don't even

6513.84 --> 6518.4800000000005
see what happens

6515.84 --> 6520.639
you don't even see

6518.48 --> 6522.638999999999
what happens if if somebody's tied out

6520.639 --> 6524.84
you just don't see anything even as the

6522.639 --> 6530.4800000000005
freaking channel owner

6524.84 --> 6533.4400000000005
why youtube why are you doing this again

6530.48 --> 6536.44
it was perfect why have you ruined it

6533.44 --> 6536.44
again

6541.28 --> 6544.96
i mean what the hell should the channel

6543.76 --> 6547.84
owner be

6544.96 --> 6550.159
why should a channel owner be unable

6547.84 --> 6552.8
to remove a message

6550.159 --> 6555.679
from somebody that has a wrench

6552.8 --> 6559.96
for some reason

6555.679 --> 6559.96
that makes no freaking sense

6578.56 --> 6585.1990000000005
right anyway yeah enjoy that movie if

6583.04 --> 6587.28
if you're gonna watch that i don't know

6585.199 --> 6588.638999999999
if you haven't watched it

6587.28 --> 6591.04
then yeah

6588.639 --> 6594.400000000001
i mean it's a movie that like for guys

6591.04 --> 6596.32
that i typically accept here in my chat

6594.4 --> 6598.719
i would at least like a front flat earth

6596.32 --> 6600.799999999999
yeah you should watch it

6598.719 --> 6602.639
at least one time

6600.8 --> 6604.08
and then i want the fear then i want

6602.639 --> 6606.8
some feedback

6604.08 --> 6611.599
even if just feeling wise i want to just

6606.8 --> 6614.4800000000005
know if you agree to what i see in this

6611.599 --> 6616.8
right that's it so it's a good movie to

6614.48 --> 6616.799999999999
watch

6617.84 --> 6624.0
just be careful but it's not a movie

6620.639 --> 6626.32
like no kids it is like distinctly 12

6624.0 --> 6626.32
plus

6629.119 --> 6634.239
and if you're like super christian

6632.0 --> 6636.08
american style you're probably gonna not

6634.239 --> 6639.28
like this movie

6636.08 --> 6641.5199999999995
although it's not anti-christian even

6639.28 --> 6643.92
have like a cross in there it is

6641.52 --> 6645.599
actually very christian

6643.92 --> 6647.52
it's just not

6645.599 --> 6650.159000000001
american

6647.52 --> 6653.4400000000005
right it's european you basically get to

6650.159 --> 6656.32
see a woman's bush at the end

6653.44 --> 6657.919999999999
but not even grossly purely as an

6656.32 --> 6659.679
aesthetic thing it's you could say it's

6657.92 --> 6662.159
a french thing that's like the thing

6659.679 --> 6664.08
that makes it so freaking european

6662.159 --> 6667.119
because i don't know european movies

6664.08 --> 6668.96
just really like to do that

6667.119 --> 6670.0
because they allow it or something i

6668.96 --> 6672.8
don't know

6670.0 --> 6673.92
right but

6672.8 --> 6676.08
like

6673.92 --> 6679.28
morally

6676.08 --> 6682.5599999999995
it's a very good movie and everybody has

6679.28 --> 6684.08
like senses in them like

6682.56 --> 6685.599
it's real

6684.08 --> 6688.239
so real

6685.599 --> 6690.56
natural senses it's all very sensible

6688.239 --> 6693.629
and i like that about it

6690.56 --> 6693.629000000001
[Music]

6697.44 --> 6702.48
ah my eyes yeah yeah

6700.48 --> 6704.0
yeah americans you're you're gonna have

6702.48 --> 6706.159
to deal with that it's

6704.0 --> 6706.159
like

6706.239 --> 6710.959999999999
it's like somewhere in the last five

6708.159 --> 6712.4
minutes or something so

6710.96 --> 6716.84
by that time

6712.4 --> 6716.839999999999
you should be able to handle that

6722.28 --> 6725.438999999999
[Music]

6733.76 --> 6737.400000000001
but yeah it's definitely not for little

6736.56 --> 6739.679
kids

6737.4 --> 6743.199
absolutely not

6739.679 --> 6745.4400000000005
like they will get really scared

6743.199 --> 6748.719
like i i can imagine that if i would

6745.44 --> 6751.199
have been like eight and i watched this

6748.719 --> 6753.44
i would have been probably traumatized

6751.199 --> 6755.199
like i would become probably obsessed

6753.44 --> 6757.04
with things about it that are just like

6755.199 --> 6759.36
out of my reach because i'm not old

6757.04 --> 6759.36
enough

6761.04 --> 6765.36
it's it's just meant

6763.52 --> 6766.88
for like

6765.36 --> 6770.239
a little bit more

6766.88 --> 6774.32
slightly more mature audience like 12

6770.239 --> 6774.32
because it's also really about just like

6774.639 --> 6779.84
the personal challenge and manhood and

6777.28 --> 6782.48
like dealing with puberty like the main

6779.84 --> 6785.76
character how the story starts out he is

6782.48 --> 6788.718999999999
really dealing with that right

6785.76 --> 6788.719
that's what it's about

6789.52 --> 6794.4800000000005
this film is my baby

6791.52 --> 6797.280000000001
it's not really my baby maybe my adopted

6794.48 --> 6798.638999999999
baby i found it when i first watched

6797.28 --> 6800.5599999999995
this movie

6798.639 --> 6802.4800000000005
i was crying

6800.56 --> 6805.280000000001
i was crying i thought it was that

6802.48 --> 6808.239
beautiful i was like ecstatic

6805.28 --> 6810.96
i like that it exists

6808.239 --> 6813.598999999999
that something like this exists

6810.96 --> 6815.84
because i was really like looking for

6813.599 --> 6816.719
that sort of thing

6815.84 --> 6818.639
and it

6816.719 --> 6820.88
yeah i've dealt with

6818.639 --> 6822.96
[ __ ] up people

6820.88 --> 6827.04
that actually have access to that sort

6822.96 --> 6831.36
of stuff and not and like use it evil

6827.04 --> 6831.36
and to then see that movie was just like

6832.239 --> 6837.04
like good still exists kind of relief

6835.92 --> 6840.0
okay

6837.04 --> 6840.0
it's very intense

6846.8 --> 6852.320000000001
so yeah i just i don't know i just

6849.599 --> 6852.32
really like it

6852.639 --> 6856.159000000001
and

6853.36 --> 6859.679
freaking out man my my healer's

6856.159 --> 6861.679
spirit guide approved of it now without

6859.679 --> 6863.679
the the actual healer guy having

6861.679 --> 6865.119
actually seen the movie

6863.679 --> 6867.36
all right

6865.119 --> 6869.92
so it's like i've been green-lighted

6867.36 --> 6871.04
like i i'm it's okay to keep talking

6869.92 --> 6873.04
about this

6871.04 --> 6874.8
to bring it back up to make sure like

6873.04 --> 6876.48
did you watch this did you watch this

6874.8 --> 6878.2390000000005
did you watch this did you watch this

6876.48 --> 6879.919999999999
did you watch this you don't have to

6878.239 --> 6883.44
watch it over and over again but you

6879.92 --> 6884.88
have to watch it like once

6883.44 --> 6888.44
at least once

6884.88 --> 6888.4400000000005
and then we'll see

6890.08 --> 6895.76
right and there's a big likelihood that

6892.4 --> 6898.32
when you've watched it you immediately

6895.76 --> 6901.04
get like life enthusiasm out of it and

6898.32 --> 6902.719
you want to watch something else

6901.04 --> 6904.4
guess what's going to happen as soon as

6902.719 --> 6906.8
you watch something else that's

6904.4 --> 6908.879999999999
immediately gonna rip that good spirit

6906.8 --> 6911.28
right back out of you

6908.88 --> 6913.1990000000005
that's what's gonna happen

6911.28 --> 6916.159
trust me on that

6913.199 --> 6917.28
best thing to do is watch it

6916.159 --> 6921.36
turn

6917.28 --> 6924.32
the computer off turn your phone off

6921.36 --> 6928.08
and like go into the garden

6924.32 --> 6932.08
and just smell the fresh air

6928.08 --> 6933.84
eat something or like go into the woods

6932.08 --> 6937.44
that's my recommendation when you

6933.84 --> 6939.1990000000005
watched it go out in nature don't go

6937.44 --> 6941.28
freaking watch something else it's

6939.199 --> 6943.04
immediately going to ruin

6941.28 --> 6944.96
the good energy that it brought if you

6943.04 --> 6947.679
do that

6944.96 --> 6948.88
i mean this watching it is therapeutical

6947.679 --> 6951.119
it should be

6948.88 --> 6952.2390000000005
if you have any

6951.119 --> 6955.28
like

6952.239 --> 6957.5199999999995
natural emotions in you and all that it

6955.28 --> 6961.84
should absolutely

6957.52 --> 6961.84
give you like a lot of energy

6962.0 --> 6965.0
anyway

6986.0 --> 6991.28
what is all the other cowboy movies all

6988.4 --> 6993.36
the western and ah

6991.28 --> 6995.84
okay

6993.36 --> 6999.679
yeah i'm not talking about any other

6995.84 --> 6999.679
westerns it's all super cool

7000.48 --> 7003.44
yeah

7001.44 --> 7004.879999999999
no

7003.44 --> 7007.678999999999
just this one

7004.88 --> 7007.679
just this one

7009.599 --> 7012.08
anyway

7012.8 --> 7017.159000000001
i think i'm gonna run out the show

7017.84 --> 7023.2390000000005
it's been over the place

7019.76 --> 7023.2390000000005
that's for sure

7033.04 --> 7038.719
you might watch it after the stream all

7034.719 --> 7038.719
right psycbear cool good on you

7038.8 --> 7045.360000000001
make sure you get the right subtitle

7042.08 --> 7047.5199999999995
and yeah like enjoy it and then don't

7045.36 --> 7049.04
immediately start watching something

7047.52 --> 7050.56
else

7049.04 --> 7051.76
like actually

7050.56 --> 7055.52
let it

7051.76 --> 7057.599
sit there after you watched it

7055.52 --> 7060.719
and like enjoy nature or something

7057.599 --> 7060.719
that's my tip to you

7069.28 --> 7072.639999999999
right

7070.159 --> 7074.4
so

7072.64 --> 7078.2390000000005

7091.199 --> 7095.04
really appreciate it when i get super

7093.599 --> 7097.599
pissed off

7095.04 --> 7099.92
right because i guess there's a market

7097.599 --> 7101.04
for that too it's basically people that

7099.92 --> 7103.76
are like oh

7101.04 --> 7108.08
i can't do anything i'm all

7103.76 --> 7109.599
