[Music]

31.37 --> 33.43
you

37.95 --> 45.790000000000006
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

41.98 --> 47.529999999999994
early-bird number 341 I'm your host

45.79 --> 49.45
Arwen and before start to show please

51.31 --> 54.97

53.32 --> 56.95

54.97 --> 59.739
I'm going live which is normally 2:00

p.m. Amsterdam time every day please

59.739 --> 65.02
also do support my channel and my show

62.08 --> 66.91
through the paypal patreon my GoFundMe

65.02 --> 67.81
and the super chats that would be much

66.91 --> 74.47
appreciated

67.81 --> 77.86
so the way the weather is interesting it

74.47 --> 84.64
seems to be rather windy clouds are

77.86 --> 88.66
moving fast see you can even pick it up

84.64 --> 92.47
on the silly little webcam and well the

88.66 --> 95.32
Sun is kind of nice and shiny so it's

92.47 --> 99.88
not all clouds I do see a lot of

95.32 --> 103.83
chemtrail activity probably not too

99.88 --> 108.69999999999999
recent behind those clouds you see it

103.83 --> 112.17
way higher elevation but yeah despite

108.7 --> 116.86
all that it's still kind of a nice day

112.17 --> 121.83
still fresh but not really cold not

116.86 --> 125.679
water cold mmm

121.83 --> 129.57999999999998
so yeah I got tumeric coffee with me

125.679 --> 135.49
again today and tea that's it I got a

129.58 --> 138.03
pretty late very very long sleep this

135.49 --> 142.78
night and it did me a lot of good I

138.03 --> 146.41
really needed that something like a

142.78 --> 148.69
restless piece that I would just wasn't

146.41 --> 151.27
able to get out of my system every time

148.69 --> 154.879
I tried to sleep in the last 3-4 days

151.27 --> 161.65900000000002
and I think I got it this time

154.879 --> 161.659
finally so I feel much more rested now

165.45 --> 174.42
[Music]

167.359 --> 178.68
also just financial situation is still

174.42 --> 182.76
the same but like I'm handling it well I

178.68 --> 187.739
think especially in reflection to

182.76 --> 191.76
earlier situations and well it seems to

187.739 --> 204.93
be already giving off its fruits and I

191.76 --> 209.25
just feel more comfortable in general so

204.93 --> 211.23000000000002
yeah a lot has been going on but before

209.25 --> 213.54
we get into all that let's go through

211.23 --> 216.03
the chat so I can actually scan it as to

213.54 --> 217.56
see what actually went on because yeah

216.03 --> 220.68
that's one of those things that I tend

217.56 --> 222.93
to do is don't tell people about it it

220.68 --> 227.01000000000002
doesn't really matter anyway drunken

222.93 --> 229.769
bullet for one one was first referring

227.01 --> 233.159
to Simon there's a lot of sign mundane

229.769 --> 235.199
related activity recently of course not

233.159 --> 236.72
live debates because you know he doesn't

235.199 --> 240.54000000000002
do that

236.72 --> 248.78
ego playing anchor good to see you

240.54 --> 251.959
Giulio Pavan every second flat soy def e

248.78 --> 251.959
Amanda you

252.53 --> 263.78
John Watson Tomoko the eye that was

260.69 --> 269.27
Watson glad she liking the background

263.78 --> 273.08
all credit goes to add a meeting because

269.27 --> 277.4

273.08 --> 282.59
put this together so shout out to Adam

on every time and they do it pretty late

294.47 --> 301.34000000000003
and it goes on usually quite a long time

297.95 --> 304.90999999999997
it's it's like a get-together on the

301.34 --> 308.33
internet so I do check them out over

304.91 --> 315.21000000000004
there and don't forget to subscribe to

308.33 --> 316.69
iron real media let me continue this um

315.21 --> 320.57
[Music]

316.69 --> 325.19
hmm of course yeah

320.57 --> 331.21
alright good to see you all so yeah that

325.19 --> 331.21
was funny it was really funny to see

332.59 --> 341.27
Kent Hovind to see him like in recent

337.43 --> 345.05
day because Kent Hovind has been active

341.27 --> 347.29999999999995
and out there in the public eye for a

345.05 --> 352.01
long time and he has had all kinds of

347.3 --> 355.94
upheaval of course when he was put into

352.01 --> 357.86
jail for something that's sheesh I

355.94 --> 361.34
shouldn't speak too much about I kind of

357.86 --> 365.75
forgot what it even was about but it's a

361.34 --> 368.78
huge controversy and the thing is that

365.75 --> 371.0
he's always been a great creationist

368.78 --> 376.01
that's his thing that that's is with God

371.0 --> 379.58
is with Christ very devout kind of rigid

376.01 --> 382.15999999999997
lever but still smart and sharp and he

379.58 --> 383.719
defends he's been defending creationism

382.16 --> 386.23900000000003
for a long time

383.719 --> 389.36
with a lot of arguments a lot of

386.239 --> 391.909
research that he's done details that he

389.36 --> 395.509
dug through so worth checking out if you

391.909 --> 398.719
think that creationism is worth

395.509 --> 402.319
investigating so but the funny thing is

398.719 --> 407.239
how he popped up after all this time was

402.319 --> 408.829
through Simon then he was doing kind of

407.239 --> 411.349
it was kind of weird he was doing a

408.829 --> 414.559
video going through something Simon Dan

411.349 --> 415.969
said I think that Simon Dan was you know

414.559 --> 418.579
I barely picked up on it because

415.969 --> 422.3
everything Simon and tries to do is just

418.579 --> 426.11
so shoddy and columns II but I think he

422.3 --> 428.899
tried to defend evolution and of course

426.11 --> 431.149
there was a total train wreck and it was

428.899 --> 433.759
kind of funny to see Kent Hovind doing

431.149 --> 435.829
his thing also interesting to see what

433.759 --> 441.099
was within his argumentation and

435.829 --> 446.17900000000003
vernacular and he gave off a very strong

441.099 --> 450.37899999999996
current political right-wing kind of

446.179 --> 452.599
feel so that's apparently the typical

450.379 --> 455.269
thing that he's aiming for it within his

452.599 --> 457.269
audience you know what I mean he did it

455.269 --> 460.42900000000003
several times

457.269 --> 463.939
comparing to certain things and yeah

460.429 --> 466.339
it's very typical but yeah also

463.939 --> 470.029
interesting to note is that he's not a

466.339 --> 472.219
flat earth and he's like thought of Flat

470.029 --> 476.86899999999997
Earth as he's to try to defend the globe

472.219 --> 479.269
and that's also the thing that with

476.869 --> 481.09900000000005
creationism he's on our side but when it

479.269 --> 483.439
comes to Flat Earth I don't think I

481.099 --> 484.669
haven't heard any updates about it so I

483.439 --> 487.879
don't know what he thinks about it

484.669 --> 490.399
currently you know if he's really honest

487.879 --> 495.22900000000004
with himself he should take a peek at

490.399 --> 498.229
the the real scientific research that

495.229 --> 500.539
we've been doing I hope he does pick up

498.229 --> 502.3
on it you know through Simon then he

500.539 --> 507.05
probably must have picked up on it

502.3 --> 509.719
because Simon dan shouts down and does a

507.05 --> 512.269
lot of nonsense relating to Nathan

509.719 --> 515.099
Oakley so he must have picked up on that

512.269 --> 520.149
somehow so we'll see

515.099 --> 524.49
and yeah the funny thing is I have a

520.149 --> 527.019
personal history thingy involving him

524.49 --> 529.57
because before I was a flat earther I

527.019 --> 532.93
reverted to and researched Kent Hovind

529.57 --> 534.6700000000001
and I defended against evolution myself

532.93 --> 537.6999999999999
back in the day within my friend sir who

534.67 --> 539.649
got a lot of anger from him everybody

537.7 --> 543.3290000000001
was really pissed off that I did that

539.649 --> 550.3
but I thought like yeah but seriously

543.329 --> 554.1999999999999
it's wrong every time now I say it's

550.3 --> 557.05
wrong that's in my heart reference to

554.2 --> 560.3100000000001
Fineman how he said it's so glorious

557.05 --> 563.38
that that was for the camera and and

560.31 --> 568.029
sound recorded that that he did that

563.38 --> 571.3
that's glorious so I defended back then

568.029 --> 576.63
and one of the times Flat Earth was

571.3 --> 576.63
broken to me once again which was in

577.35 --> 586.899
2010/11 like right around the time I met

582.55 --> 589.24
my ex too but yeah the guy I'm not gonna

586.899 --> 592.57
name his name because he kind of

589.24 --> 597.55
retracted he I told I spoke out about it

592.57 --> 599.88
he had a an open lecture also relating

597.55 --> 603.04
to Flat Earth and other conspiracies and

599.88 --> 606.85
when he did that very brazenly

603.04 --> 609.31
he got like a weird figure with a beard

606.85 --> 612.37
all dressed in black carrying a lot of

609.31 --> 615.9699999999999
medals that took him separate and

612.37 --> 618.55
seemingly threatened him and after that

615.97 --> 622.3290000000001
he retracted everything concerning Flat

618.55 --> 626.17
Earth but the guy held on to Kent Hovind

622.329 --> 629.529
very strongly it was like oh god at

626.17 --> 633.76
least I can there's still somebody out

629.529 --> 636.459
there that is good with the rest that's

633.76 --> 640.3199999999999
how he seemed to approach can Hovind and

636.459 --> 640.3199999999999
that always really stuck to me

642.43 --> 654.529
but anyway yeah that's just the personal

646.339 --> 657.6500000000001
experience is everybody picking up on

654.529 --> 659.93
this yeah right

657.65 --> 664.37
oh yeah and by the way the weird thing

659.93 --> 667.4599999999999
was about that is I was really absorbing

664.37 --> 670.07
more info concerning Flat Earth related

667.46 --> 672.74
ideas and things and maps just but I was

670.07 --> 675.8900000000001
just fascinating with it as a novelty

672.74 --> 677.42
because my mind was clearer I was more

675.89 --> 679.9399999999999
confident in order to actually

677.42 --> 683.27
assimilate the data but I wasn't ready

679.94 --> 685.0100000000001
to take it as a bottom-line reality kind

683.27 --> 689.68
of thing it wasn't that clear to me yet

685.01 --> 693.77
and that's also why as the guy broke off

689.68 --> 695.9
I kind of forgot about Flat Earth I put

693.77 --> 697.8199999999999
it a bit on the background but it was

695.9 --> 699.77
still fascinating to me and at the end

697.82 --> 702.62
of the relationship I act I kind of

699.77 --> 705.22
hidden blur grabbed out to it but I did

702.62 --> 708.44
it in front of the wrong person and

705.22 --> 713.63
that's what also probably in my opinion

708.44 --> 717.7090000000001
caused a cascade of [ __ ] that made me

713.63 --> 719.0
end up with nothing here all seemingly

717.709 --> 721.779
nothing I was correct

719.0 --> 725.27
made me it cost the part of the collapse

721.779 --> 726.22
that set up and cost me to forget it

725.27 --> 728.54
again

726.22 --> 730.4590000000001
just because I threw it all the way

728.54 --> 732.77
including the data what that was still

730.459 --> 739.0889999999999
processing and that's how I forgot about

732.77 --> 744.6999999999999
it again and then snap 2015 bang YouTube

739.089 --> 744.7
Flat Earth clues and this time yeah

745.53 --> 753.5
I the funny thing was that I experienced

750.6 --> 758.61
as if I had lost everything and suddenly

753.5 --> 762.24
it's not so far out of the way to start

758.61 --> 764.25
trying to see well maybe Flat Earth and

762.24 --> 767.73
all that could be taken as a baseline

764.25 --> 770.1
like let's just see if this makes sense

767.73 --> 773.22
or if this is going to presumably drive

770.1 --> 776.5500000000001
me insane as was being suggested at the

773.22 --> 779.94
time like people can get really panicky

776.55 --> 785.0699999999999
but back in the day not not so much

779.94 --> 788.37
anymore now and I started doing it and

785.07 --> 791.1
no I didn't go insane I did get a like a

788.37 --> 795.63
lot of overkill enthusiasm though and

791.1 --> 799.6800000000001
that kept me awake and also a bit of

795.63 --> 802.41
like fear images like the whole dark

799.68 --> 809.51
world situation just completely overcame

802.41 --> 812.25
me clear as clear as the Sun as daylight

809.51 --> 814.92
although it was darkness yet that was a

812.25 --> 817.53
big shock but it wasn't Flat Earth

814.92 --> 820.8199999999999
itself the subject or the technicals

817.53 --> 825.93
that did that it just for some reason

820.82 --> 828.1800000000001
unleashed all that and chained things

825.93 --> 830.88
and certainly I was able to start to

828.18 --> 833.0699999999999
puzzle out what what was the what was

830.88 --> 835.47
really going on all these things that I

833.07 --> 838.2
kept in my in the background didn't

835.47 --> 840.6600000000001
really show to the outside world never

838.2 --> 845.5200000000001
gave it too much thought but yet it did

840.66 --> 847.7099999999999
guide me in ways very mystically and now

845.52 --> 850.89
I'm starting to look at it and start to

847.71 --> 853.14
critically think about it without fear

850.89 --> 856.97
like I'm so like it seems now I'm

853.14 --> 861.29
supposed to be doing it and I'm just

856.97 --> 863.48
and yeah unraveling a lot of mysteries

861.29 --> 868.01
about it and misconceptions that I've

863.48 --> 870.11
had and that's the fascinating thing but

868.01 --> 873.38
that's I guess it's kind of a bonus for

870.11 --> 878.77
me it's not really Flat Earth related

873.38 --> 882.17
just seems to be entangled with it

878.77 --> 884.3
anyway that's just my experience by the

882.17 --> 886.3399999999999
way thank you Giulio Pavan for the

884.3 --> 888.1999999999999

923.889 --> 929.49
a lot thank you

953.25 --> 959.91
yes awesome um right let's get back to

958.439 --> 963.319
the show yeah

959.91 --> 968.25
Julia Pavan thank you so much sir I

963.319 --> 976.62
really appreciate that because those are

968.25 --> 980.069
the things that really help a lot as I'm

976.62 --> 982.829
trying to get my financial situation

980.069 --> 986.3389999999999
just better refined like going over

982.829 --> 990.0889999999999
things over and over again trying to get

986.339 --> 992.85
a better grip on my own needs and what I

990.089 --> 995.4300000000001
need to stay afloat and be able to still

992.85 --> 997.2900000000001
grow and expand and not reach a dead

995.43 --> 999.66
halt as I'm trying to figure that out

997.29 --> 1002.0
like every bit that I unexpectedly

999.66 --> 1005.029
because I don't really expect it I hope

1002.0 --> 1007.79
for it but when people do give me that

1005.029 --> 1012.29
it makes a huge difference it really

1007.79 --> 1014.75
does it's like I don't know why but for

1012.29 --> 1017.329

1114.52 --> 1123.49
there because typically as happens when

1118.84 --> 1127.33
the summer ends I tend to get weird

1123.49 --> 1129.58
issues my face and no matter the amount

1127.33 --> 1137.32
of supplements that I have it doesn't

1129.58 --> 1141.309

1137.32 --> 1147.3899999999999
can always be worse that's just but ya

julieopp happen again that's incredible

1273.629 --> 1278.58
I'm a little a bit lost for words

1287.6 --> 1291.99
yeah

1288.84 --> 1294.51
also it's weird I can't explain it's

1291.99 --> 1296.25
just you get a little flustered when

1294.51 --> 1299.76
suddenly they'll comes rolling in like

1296.25 --> 1303.57
that I don't expect that to happen ever

1299.76 --> 1306.21
really but I do remember that I of

1303.57 --> 1308.7
course keep on saying please donate and

1306.21 --> 1310.8600000000001
all that and explain the situation just

1308.7 --> 1313.56
as honest as I can and now I kind of

1310.86 --> 1317.82
feel guilty about it weird that works

1313.56 --> 1321.99
right but I just have to get over that

1317.82 --> 1325.35
and superficial nonsense and just be

1321.99 --> 1328.59
thankful because it helps a lot and it

1325.35 --> 1331.53
fixes my situation and that means I'll

1328.59 --> 1334.9199999999998
have more energy I'll be able to keep on

1331.53 --> 1337.23
going hold on to inspirations and find

1334.92 --> 1342.47
new inspirations better so thank you so

1337.23 --> 1342.47
much everyone I really feel appreciated

1352.08 --> 1364.83
yeah well Ares 106 look I have plenty of

1357.78 --> 1366.6
gratitude to go around so what do I need

1364.83 --> 1375.12
to do with all that gratitude isn't

1366.6 --> 1376.2199999999998
gratitude actually forgiving I don't

1375.12 --> 1378.9599999999998
know

1376.22 --> 1380.88
but hey maybe people get a kick out of

1378.96 --> 1391.26
seeing our when getting all flustered

1380.88 --> 1393.39
and yeah sure why not I'm not worried

1391.26 --> 1399.87
about it I know the dark ones are always

1393.39 --> 1403.47
watching I know they are they'll try to

1399.87 --> 1405.51
get out of it whatever they can even

1403.47 --> 1407.82
though it's seemingly meaningless to us

1405.51 --> 1411.87
who if we even get a hint at what

1407.82 --> 1415.71
they're doing but yeah let's not

1411.87 --> 1420.02
distract that thank you

1415.71 --> 1420.02
let's get back to some points

1424.13 --> 1429.3400000000001
average wins stay caged up I'm doing my

1427.13 --> 1429.3400000000001
best

1431.53 --> 1442.8799999999999
it's just better I think a rage win is

1435.56 --> 1444.59
more for springtime because then the the

1442.88 --> 1447.71
social settings are right and there's

1444.59 --> 1452.03
more of a certain type of person that

1447.71 --> 1456.02
might be attracted to that I know maybe

1452.03 --> 1459.59
it's me just being a man or whatever but

1456.02 --> 1462.77
in in after the summer it's just not

1459.59 --> 1468.59
good I don't know I've had pretty

1462.77 --> 1472.8799999999999
rageful harvest time and usually it

1468.59 --> 1476.1799999999998
would damage me I would be left with

1472.88 --> 1477.97
more pain in the springtime it doesn't

1476.18 --> 1483.26
happen so much like that

1477.97 --> 1485.6000000000001
it's more excitement in that period so

1483.26 --> 1489.1299999999999
that's why I'm just really keeping a lid

1485.6 --> 1489.1299999999999
on it as much as I can now

1496.41 --> 1507.27
all right Laurie Latia ho the dark ones

1501.06 --> 1510.12
are the spirit the consciousness out

1507.27 --> 1513.9
there whether they be human or not human

1510.12 --> 1516.78
probably both that well on the lowest of

1513.9 --> 1519.15
frequencies a consciousness can they're

1516.78 --> 1522.75
still watching it's just that things

1519.15 --> 1525.14
don't mean the same thing to them as it

1522.75 --> 1525.14
does to us

1533.1 --> 1539.07
all right that's all right yeah look you

1535.95 --> 1542.73
guys don't have to feel guilty for not

1539.07 --> 1546.21
donating okay I have to say miss you

1542.73 --> 1549.09
sometimes because when I see a show and

1546.21 --> 1551.519
I really appreciate something I

1549.09 --> 1554.039
sometimes you really do want to like

1551.519 --> 1556.74
give them some money it's just that I

1554.039 --> 1559.169
can't I can't I can't do it and I feel

1556.74 --> 1563.0
like you know poor stupid

1559.169 --> 1566.97
Arwen can't do it you know I feel that

1563.0 --> 1569.909
but that's also why like don't worry

1566.97 --> 1573.21
about it and I'm very glad that a lot of

1569.909 --> 1575.7890000000002
people that do have shows and you asked

1573.21 --> 1579.8400000000001
for today also mention that like if you

1575.789 --> 1582.6
can't then don't worry about it because

1579.84 --> 1587.49
I do feel guilty sometimes it's just

1582.6 --> 1591.4499999999998
like I can't help it at this time like

1587.49 --> 1595.049
I'm in the red I can't do that kind of

1591.45 --> 1601.529
thing but if I would be able to at some

1595.049 --> 1604.259
point I will even if just to make up for

1601.529 --> 1607.98
being such a cheapskate or well maybe

1604.259 --> 1612.23
not cheapskate being so poor in these

1607.98 --> 1612.23
last year's as I came in to YouTube

1616.76 --> 1624.26
I just hope that a lot of money if it

1622.04 --> 1630.17
ever happens isn't gonna turn me into a

1624.26 --> 1641.06
dick I'll worry about that problem when

1630.17 --> 1643.67
or if it ever arrives why doesn't the

1641.06 --> 1646.1
radiation of the Sun increase when it's

1643.67 --> 1653.93
supposedly it's three million miles

1646.1 --> 1656.4699999999998
closer are where that's a very strange

1653.93 --> 1656.47
question

1665.29 --> 1673.54
would be cool pina hmm that's an

1670.21 --> 1677.23
interesting idea that's an interesting

1673.54 --> 1682.33
idea of LG I'd have to think about it

1677.23 --> 1684.55
that that might not be in a bad idea as

1682.33 --> 1688.36
a side kind of thing that could work

1684.55 --> 1691.06
I I do have some photography skills it's

1688.36 --> 1696.1899999999998
just I haven't really considered it

1691.06 --> 1700.6299999999999
professionally in any way although I the

1696.19 --> 1705.52
friend of mine in Amy she has so that's

1700.63 --> 1707.17
entry might be able to actually ask but

1705.52 --> 1713.5
anyway the next time I'm going there I'm

1707.17 --> 1718.6000000000001
taking my p900 with me and it's gonna be

1713.5 --> 1721.03
interesting because she yeah she is very

1718.6 --> 1723.6699999999998
smart and she has a lot of ideas as

1721.03 --> 1728.28
she's very creative and driven and

1723.67 --> 1731.5600000000002
that's inspiring to me and yeah I

1728.28 --> 1736.06
already told her like you know what in a

1731.56 --> 1741.21
way I would see us being like partners

1736.06 --> 1741.21
in a business together and she agreed

1744.74 --> 1750.98
right I could Dave Johnson and the thing

1748.97 --> 1755.1490000000001
is also one of the things about it is

1750.98 --> 1758.919
that even there's a lot of skills that

1755.149 --> 1763.07
when you start to apply them for money

1758.919 --> 1765.3500000000001
you'll get sick of it of the skill it's

1763.07 --> 1767.3899999999999
very widely known in the professional

1765.35 --> 1771.35
world it's a big problem with a lot of

1767.39 --> 1772.76
professions but photography I think for

1771.35 --> 1777.4399999999998
me wouldn't do that

1772.76 --> 1781.64
it couldn't take away the not the great

1777.44 --> 1785.539
thing about it it's like no matter who

1781.64 --> 1788.63
I'd be photography photographing I'd get

1785.539 --> 1792.83
something good out of it always even if

1788.63 --> 1795.8300000000002
they were like really obnoxious or just

1792.83 --> 1798.1399999999999
dark hidden people or whatever I'd be

1795.83 --> 1801.049
picking up with my senses I I would

1798.14 --> 1805.8200000000002
always get something out of it so that's

1801.049 --> 1811.25
an it I good idea actually thank you

1805.82 --> 1814.039
yeah so yeah we'll see where that goes

1811.25 --> 1823.61
it may need some time to sink in but

1814.039 --> 1827.779
it's a good idea thank you right Dave

1823.61 --> 1830.9289999999999
Johnson well that is well a good example

1827.779 --> 1832.94
too yeah if you're a car mechanic it's

1830.929 --> 1835.73
very tough to lose your love for it

1832.94 --> 1837.409
unless you're the cars you're going the

1835.73 --> 1840.5
problems you're going to be fixing are

1837.409 --> 1842.69
not really car mechanic related but

1840.5 --> 1845.809
you're constantly dealing with stupid

1842.69 --> 1848.27
computer systems that would be something

1845.809 --> 1849.95
that definitely ruined your love for

1848.27 --> 1852.799
cars because you wouldn't barely be

1849.95 --> 1854.75
doing the mechanics you'd constantly be

1852.799 --> 1861.77
doing other stupid [ __ ] that has been

1854.75 --> 1864.94
added on to it so it all depends but I

1861.77 --> 1864.94
get your point

1878.68 --> 1885.04
all right oh yeah I can imagine that one

1881.559 --> 1889.41
more colored if you have a profession

1885.04 --> 1892.0
people are always gonna try to get some

1889.41 --> 1900.309
something from your profession for free

1892.0 --> 1903.22
and it's really annoying because to you

1900.309 --> 1906.85
it may feel like oh yeah this is unique

1903.22 --> 1910.66
but that person will have had exactly

1906.85 --> 1914.07
that kind of proposal probably hundreds

1910.66 --> 1916.809
of times at least it's really annoying

1914.07 --> 1919.059
my ex had a problem with that too

1916.809 --> 1923.71
she's a really good dentist but she just

1919.059 --> 1926.74
she refused to do favors with her

1923.71 --> 1930.27
profession and actually she did it once

1926.74 --> 1942.91
but it was really an emergency situation

1930.27 --> 1945.67
and I it was very grateful to her so and

1942.91 --> 1948.66
so was she because I was literally in

1945.67 --> 1955.929
agony and it was in on a Sunday and I

1948.66 --> 1959.74
was going crazy it was really a cute so

1955.929 --> 1962.89
anyway that's but yeah professionals

1959.74 --> 1966.76
hate it when friends start to ask for

1962.89 --> 1968.3700000000001
free professional favors they really

1966.76 --> 1972.21
hate it all of them

1968.37 --> 1972.2099999999998
what's my profession

1976.21 --> 1986.8400000000001
teacher but I guess that as a teacher I

1981.02 --> 1988.85
do give out a lot of free advice so I

1986.84 --> 1991.07
don't know with teachers it's different

1988.85 --> 1999.3999999999999
because the whole point of teaching is

1991.07 --> 1999.3999999999999
that people will actually learn so yeah

2005.79 --> 2011.02
very funny

2007.48 --> 2014.46
Marceline very funny

2011.02 --> 2014.46
tell me how that works

2037.17 --> 2044.179
no Sparrow music no I don't have a

2041.49 --> 2044.179
teaching diploma

2053.36 --> 2059.29
okay when it comes to registered

2056.15 --> 2061.06
professions I guess I'm a goldsmith I

2059.29 --> 2067.46
did that

2061.06 --> 2071.54
officially yeah that's the only real

2067.46 --> 2073.93
noteworthy profession but I do a lot of

2071.54 --> 2073.93
things

2080.88 --> 2086.13
let's just say it like this in weird

2083.58 --> 2088.41
circumstances I've given advice to

2086.13 --> 2095.6400000000003
people on the spot and then they gave me

2088.41 --> 2098.19
money because it was really the right

2095.64 --> 2101.16
advice at the right moment and I barely

2098.19 --> 2104.94
even knew the people and this is quite a

2101.16 --> 2113.66
some time ago in yeah in a weird period

2104.94 --> 2118.98
but yeah I've I've never really been

2113.66 --> 2121.5899999999997
wanted to integrate myself with society

2118.98 --> 2130.65
so much as to register as something I

2121.59 --> 2133.26
just do things I just do it the thing

2130.65 --> 2137.9100000000003
that I want to do and I teach myself and

2133.26 --> 2141.8900000000003
I learn to do it and I don't really give

2137.91 --> 2141.89
a lot about some kind of paper and

2154.74 --> 2164.43
right well Ian Adams that's a good point

2157.83 --> 2168.06
yeah problem is is that the curriculum

2164.43 --> 2171.39
for very young people is the most under

2168.06 --> 2174.18
pressures under the most attack so even

2171.39 --> 2178.2599999999998
if I would sign up say for a teacher in

2174.18 --> 2181.859
that level I would be in Chains as to

2178.26 --> 2184.5
what I could accomplish or I'd get fired

2181.859 --> 2186.45
that's how that works and that's also

2184.5 --> 2189.42
the reason why I've kind of stayed out

2186.45 --> 2193.41
because I don't want to be forced don't

2189.42 --> 2195.1800000000003
want to be contractually obligated to do

2193.41 --> 2222.2999999999997
things I know are wrong

2195.18 --> 2228.27
I refuse and here on YouTube I have a

2222.3 --> 2230.9700000000003
platform and it's it's free whatever you

2228.27 --> 2233.849
think of it so if you think of me as

2230.97 --> 2235.3799999999997
some as a teacher that has interesting

2233.849 --> 2242.339
ideas and knowledge you can explain

2235.38 --> 2245.599
things as worthwhile things to to take

2242.339 --> 2251.81
note of then you can see this as a class

2245.599 --> 2254.9100000000003
although I have no specific guarantees I

2251.81 --> 2256.859
do my best to just make things

2254.91 --> 2261.0299999999997
interesting and to stay on the stay

2256.859 --> 2268.8489999999997
focused and take whatever challenge I

2261.03 --> 2268.849
can that's sensible

2274.71 --> 2293.46
true suffering okay all right well

2290.28 --> 2296.67
Lottie says if you're gonna go on the

2293.46 --> 2299.67
average people and their opinions well

2296.67 --> 2302.31
then you'd have to actually take size up

2299.67 --> 2305.04
what the average people are and what

2302.31 --> 2308.43
they do and then when you take note of

2305.04 --> 2311.27
that it doesn't really matter what they

2308.43 --> 2311.27
think so

2317.64 --> 2323.9
my target audience is not the average

2320.04 --> 2327.6
person that seems kind of obvious

2323.9 --> 2329.88
although I try to stay as open as I can

2327.6 --> 2332.16
and I realized that just most of the

2329.88 --> 2335.88
things that I talk about it into the

2332.16 --> 2340.41
detail that I do is just too much to

2335.88 --> 2344.07
grab to hold on to for a lot of people

2340.41 --> 2347.67
but I hope that maybe they find some

2344.07 --> 2350.73
kind of stimulation in it and grow some

2347.67 --> 2354.7200000000003
roots in order to eventually grab it

2350.73 --> 2356.22
better a lot of other people have so

2354.72 --> 2359.79
I've noticed that a lot of people just

2356.22 --> 2362.7
get me a lot better now so it does work

2359.79 --> 2365.46
I don't know what the average person how

2362.7 --> 2368.1899999999996
they really recite I'm figuring out all

2365.46 --> 2371.58
right I'm expecting that most the

2368.19 --> 2374.91
average people that bump into that will

2371.58 --> 2378.2999999999997
probably be pretty yeah like what is

2374.91 --> 2380.46
this it's just very surreal at first and

2378.3 --> 2382.2000000000003
they may just keep everything to

2380.46 --> 2385.86
themselves and kind of like secretly

2382.2 --> 2387.6299999999997
follow me maybe they will get out

2385.86 --> 2390.4500000000003
something out of it but they'll keep it

2387.63 --> 2392.4
to themselves hey if that works it works

2390.45 --> 2393.93
if you're gonna get some kind of growth

2392.4 --> 2399.69
out of it that's great that's what I

2393.93 --> 2402.39
want I want all of this foolishness to

2399.69 --> 2404.58
end all of this crazy behavior from

2402.39 --> 2408.15
everyone it's all seems to be escapism

2404.58 --> 2412.35
driven it's all anchored in some kind of

2408.15 --> 2415.62
misery self sustained or sustained from

2412.35 --> 2417.96
the outside the grip is lost and then

2415.62 --> 2423.5699999999997
you seek escapism and that's what drives

2417.96 --> 2426.36
all of this insanity in the world the

2423.57 --> 2429.4500000000003
craziness in the media how everybody

2426.36 --> 2433.44
starts to behave on the internet that

2429.45 --> 2440.1299999999997
average it's because of escapism it's

2433.44 --> 2442.4700000000003
because things are not going as people

2440.13 --> 2447.36
like them to and they don't have the

2442.47 --> 2449.7599999999998
tools to find the right path so that's

2447.36 --> 2451.4
what I'm also just trying to hand out

2449.76 --> 2455.9100000000003
the tools so people can do

2451.4 --> 2458.4300000000003
they really came to do and they have it

2455.91 --> 2462.7999999999997
it's somebody just needs to point at how

2458.43 --> 2464.2799999999997
it works anyway Thank You Lori Lori

2462.8 --> 2467.5800000000004
Letty ow

2464.28 --> 2470.0400000000004
thank you for the $20 super chat

2467.58 --> 2472.58
donation that's unexpected money day

2470.04 --> 2488.75
thank you I guess

2472.58 --> 2488.75
right yeah I know

2490.07 --> 2496.4100000000003
or Fyodor Dostoevsky what it practically

2493.08 --> 2499.29
comes down to PayPal is better indeed

2496.41 --> 2501.54
but again how the super chat seemed to

2499.29 --> 2505.08
work is eventually I have to pay it back

2501.54 --> 2508.29
it's almost like what it hands me is it

2505.08 --> 2509.97
a short-term loan and then I have to pay

2508.29 --> 2513.5099999999998
it back after all that's effectively

2509.97 --> 2518.4199999999996
what it kind of does so it doesn't help

2513.51 --> 2521.3100000000004
the the actual sum it just gives me some

2518.42 --> 2523.4700000000003
some temporary loan and that's what it

2521.31 --> 2531.2999999999997
effectively does but anyway that's all

2523.47 --> 2534.1099999999997
fine I did I think the gesture is at

2531.3 --> 2534.11
least interesting

2547.32 --> 2553.86
yeah thank you Bob and a believer all

2551.91 --> 2557.8399999999997
right but it would be great if the

2553.86 --> 2561.21
haters just found a way out you know

2557.84 --> 2564.42
because to the haters hating is the more

2561.21 --> 2568.05
viable option seemingly so what if we

2564.42 --> 2570.33
could like hand them this rope

2568.05 --> 2572.6400000000003
from above into the darkness that they

2570.33 --> 2577.95
could grab as they're slowly slipping

2572.64 --> 2580.64
down and then they might recognize like

2577.95 --> 2584.93
wait I can get all the way back up I

2580.64 --> 2588.0
don't have to sink into nothingness I

2584.93 --> 2590.3999999999996
don't know it's just maybe it's just

2588.0 --> 2592.47
some kind of romantic notion on my part

2590.4 --> 2595.4700000000003
you know maybe the dark really do have

2592.47 --> 2597.81
to just do what they do I don't know why

2595.47 --> 2606.1499999999996
they're there it just seems like it's

2597.81 --> 2609.57
too many it doesn't seem right does that

2606.15 --> 2612.63
make any sense doesn't seem right it

2609.57 --> 2616.0800000000004
seems like I and others should be doing

2612.63 --> 2621.57
something to give them a handout give

2616.08 --> 2624.56
them an another option as the world just

2621.57 --> 2629.3300000000004
keeps on darkening things and trying to

2624.56 --> 2629.33
take away the options in their minds

2638.2 --> 2641.2
see

2655.25 --> 2658.18
time we know

2656.63 --> 2662.349
[Music]

2658.18 --> 2668.47
open for Laurie what look I don't know

2662.349 --> 2673.299
about Laurie Laurie seems to be okay at

2668.47 --> 2676.24
times and so are another a lot of other

2673.299 --> 2678.999
ballers that can get pretty fanatical

2676.24 --> 2681.0389999999998
like the Laurie has definitely fanatical

2678.999 --> 2683.259
moments it's just like they need to

2681.039 --> 2688.7400000000002
prove it don't need to poke him you know

2683.259 --> 2692.109
it he knows it but he does have just a

2688.74 --> 2695.499
sensible side it's at times as well that

2692.109 --> 2699.46
gives me some hope you know and when you

2695.499 --> 2702.0989999999997
try to declare to them that that side is

2699.46 --> 2704.7690000000002
what they should stick to then they tend

2702.099 --> 2707.6800000000003
to refuse and just show like no I'm also

2704.769 --> 2710.049
that other side so that doesn't work you

2707.68 --> 2714.3289999999997
can't force somebody into a position

2710.049 --> 2717.43
they they have to decide to stay there

2714.329 --> 2720.1800000000003
they have to understand why and have a

2717.43 --> 2723.1299999999997
view into the future

2720.18 --> 2730.089
that makes sense and that allows them to

2723.13 --> 2732.46
do that so and I don't know maybe he's

2730.089 --> 2735.099
one of them I thought that toady was one

2732.46 --> 2740.609
of them at times but he's gone like he's

2735.099 --> 2746.079
gone deeper into the doodoo regions then

2740.609 --> 2749.069
then he was at first so Laurie is pretty

2746.079 --> 2749.069
much where he was

2758.46 --> 2769.27
yeah anyway

2764.32 --> 2771.6600000000003
I like Larry's accent like that's the

2769.27 --> 2776.17
thing I like Larry's accent

2771.66 --> 2783.81
Larry's accent when he is nice I hate

2776.17 --> 2786.67
his accent when he's being a troll yeah

2783.81 --> 2789.12
but probably the same thing applies to

2786.67 --> 2789.12
me

2797.41 --> 2800.5
[Music]

2802.9 --> 2811.13
pratense mmm that's ridiculous you'd

2806.299 --> 2816.519
know he doesn't it wasn't I think Lori

2811.13 --> 2816.5190000000002
was finished right he was from Finland

2818.019 --> 2826.1899999999996
I'm not too sure about it now but I

2821.559 --> 2830.049
remember something about that I could be

2826.19 --> 2830.049
mixing it up with somebody else though

2838.48 --> 2853.65
right finish I got that right hmm

2855.71 --> 2867.109
yeah yeah I finishes quite bizarre it's

2861.71 --> 2871.369
a different world I for me for my

2867.109 --> 2875.21
personal engagement I see finish like

2871.369 --> 2878.059
has a complexity level in relation to

2875.21 --> 2884.18
the surrounding language is comparable

2878.059 --> 2887.1800000000003
to bask in Spain which is like that

2884.18 --> 2891.0499999999997
language is completely different very

2887.18 --> 2892.339
are old like from another era another

2891.05 --> 2895.46
world and when you hear it

2892.339 --> 2899.14
and finishes also like that it's just

2895.46 --> 2899.14
very very different

2915.079 --> 2920.48
naughty stop it just

2924.83 --> 2931.04
now come on don't go also Vanya on one

2928.53 --> 2931.0400000000004
another now

2938.92 --> 2948.609
huh right Fyodor Dostoevsky I know oh

2944.039 --> 2954.599
they're not from Finland I thought they

2948.609 --> 2954.5989999999997
were right

2958.3 --> 2965.17
I'd have to look it up again could be I

2962.58 --> 2967.15
thought they were from Sweden but yeah

2965.17 --> 2968.9500000000003
they will I don't know they could be

2967.15 --> 2970.869
from Finland I don't remember it's a

2968.95 --> 2974.6499999999996
long time since I last listen to that

2970.869 --> 2977.92
stuff man that's a long time ago don't

2974.65 --> 2983.25
care too fresh in my memory about that

2977.92 --> 2983.25
type of music right oh yeah

2988.03 --> 2994.7200000000003
yeah the studio 68 go also Vanya in the

2992.68 --> 2998.95
sense that uh are you scared you scared

2994.72 --> 3002.6299999999997
me too just that is sarvagna hang out

2998.95 --> 3002.6299999999997
just out

3011.98 --> 3040.85
anyway all right yeah there is a lot of

3030.8 --> 3046.3
metal in the north that's true well I've

3040.85 --> 3050.5299999999997
heard arguing that the nor folk should

3046.3 --> 3054.9100000000003
they're Scandinavians in general have

3050.53 --> 3058.76
different type of character spectrum

3054.91 --> 3062.69
socially among wanna different attitude

3058.76 --> 3066.26
to take culturally and that causes a lot

3062.69 --> 3069.46
of males especially to suppress a lot of

3066.26 --> 3072.71
feelings that are kind of strong and

3069.46 --> 3076.4900000000002
it's only natural in that setting that

3072.71 --> 3084.14
more music would come along to try to

3076.49 --> 3086.87
give a platform to invent the rage and

3084.14 --> 3089.06
I've always emphasized sympathized a lot

3086.87 --> 3093.44
with that aspect that's why I like the

3089.06 --> 3096.08
music so much because me too I kind of

3093.44 --> 3102.02
have that as well I have very strong

3096.08 --> 3103.97
feelings I've been required to learn to

3102.02 --> 3105.5
tame a lot more but that doesn't mean

3103.97 --> 3109.0699999999997
that I don't have like this needs

3105.5 --> 3114.58
sometimes like go berserk over something

3109.07 --> 3114.5800000000004
I just don't want it to damage anything

3117.549 --> 3124.809
our wind should be a blacksmith well I

3120.039 --> 3128.699
have done blacksmithing I have done

3124.809 --> 3132.4590000000003
several practical courses made a sword

3128.699 --> 3137.4990000000003
then sharpen it and all that so I do

3132.459 --> 3139.569
know some basics about it I do know also

3137.499 --> 3141.64
the concept of how it's supposed to be

3139.569 --> 3147.819
working and just different things you

3141.64 --> 3150.6299999999997
can do with it but never really done

3147.819 --> 3150.63
anything professionally

3164.29 --> 3169.5299999999997
it's pretty evolved from rock moss

3169.56 --> 3172.7999999999997
that's hilarious

3182.58 --> 3191.97
can i weld hmm I know the technicals

3188.73 --> 3195.2400000000002
about it I think I probably did it once

3191.97 --> 3203.6099999999997
or twice I've never really efficiently

3195.24 --> 3206.16
did anything I do get the basics like

3203.61 --> 3209.7000000000003
and if I engage in something like that

3206.16 --> 3212.0699999999997
I'd need a quick refresher like few

3209.7 --> 3214.08
minutes just get reminded about the

3212.07 --> 3218.1600000000003
basics and then I totally get it again I

3214.08 --> 3221.5499999999997
think but if ya never really done

3218.16 --> 3230.91
anything didn't do any courses with it

3221.55 --> 3234.0
or anything official but yes

3230.91 --> 3243.35
things concerning metal have interested

3234.0 --> 3246.0
me throughout my life and I've had

3243.35 --> 3248.45
developed skills and knowledge in that

3246.0 --> 3250.86
region so about metals in general

3248.45 --> 3260.5099999999998
metallurgy have a big book about that

3250.86 --> 3260.51
still okay the I it's fifty pound

3281.19 --> 3283.91
hmm

3288.18 --> 3293.2
that's cool Laurie well you can test me

3291.609 --> 3297.0989999999997
you can try to test my knowledge if you

3293.2 --> 3301.049
like because there's just a lot of

3297.099 --> 3304.2400000000002
details I picked up all metals

3301.049 --> 3307.019
especially gold and silver just they

3304.24 --> 3309.7589999999996
fascinate me as to their properties

3307.019 --> 3313.72
because there is a lot of metal

3309.759 --> 3316.589
metallurgy involved well at the found a

3313.72 --> 3319.2099999999996
or well yeah not so much the intricate

3316.589 --> 3323.47
technicals electrical workings but it is

3319.21 --> 3325.48
always involved in electronics because

3323.47 --> 3331.3289999999997
of the property the different properties

3325.48 --> 3334.869
of the metals and I've always been

3331.329 --> 3338.369
fascinated by the unique properties of

3334.869 --> 3338.369
the different metals what they do

3340.049 --> 3343.47
all right Laurie

3350.22 --> 3354.2
give me a job missus

3354.46 --> 3359.66
[Music]

3364.81 --> 3373.09
ha bilgey yeah well for me that was easy

3369.64 --> 3374.3199999999997
to figure out as well that yeah the

3373.09 --> 3379.42
melting temperature

3374.32 --> 3382.2400000000002
look there's graphs confirmed empirical

3379.42 --> 3385.51
data based graphs with in metallurgy

3382.24 --> 3388.39
that say exactly where the melting

3385.51 --> 3392.7000000000003
temperatures in the evaporation even

3388.39 --> 3396.25
combining the metals yeah even with

3392.7 --> 3399.64
non-homogeneous metal things it just

3396.25 --> 3402.82
it's perfectly defined you could

3399.64 --> 3404.35
calculate it and if you had a huge model

3402.82 --> 3408.19
thing for it or maybe not to you it

3404.35 --> 3410.7999999999997
maybe it's out there and so there's just

3408.19 --> 3413.62
things that you know are just impossible

3410.8 --> 3416.02
like suppose the steel that that

3413.62 --> 3418.0
building was made of no matter what kind

3416.02 --> 3421.3
of secret ingredient would be to them is

3418.0 --> 3423.52
just if possible that jet fuel could

3421.3 --> 3426.57
melt them that kind of thing yeah that I

3423.52 --> 3432.06
figured that out pretty pretty early on

3426.57 --> 3432.06
like 2002 already

3443.589 --> 3450.94
well the I look I know it's it's pretty

3447.099 --> 3453.099
strong but I am NOT like somebody that

3450.94 --> 3456.28
could just like start shooting and keep

3453.099 --> 3458.0800000000004
that up for half an hour non-stop yeah

3456.28 --> 3459.9700000000003
that will be a lot of strain if I'd want

3458.08 --> 3464.0499999999997
to do that I'd have to do some extra

3459.97 --> 3466.72
special training and get get my body

3464.05 --> 3471.8390000000004
properly built for repetitive use but I

3466.72 --> 3476.6189999999997
am also built in a way that I can

3471.839 --> 3479.98
suddenly out of nothing have very strong

3476.619 --> 3482.44
body control and then I can just get

3479.98 --> 3485.17
that strength in a few moments perfectly

3482.44 --> 3488.9500000000003
perfectly under control without wearing

3485.17 --> 3492.369
my body out or damaging myself it's yeah

3488.95 --> 3495.91
it's a very handy thing to have as part

3492.369 --> 3500.02
of your instinct if you can train it if

3495.91 --> 3505.359
you can figure out a way to to figure it

3500.02 --> 3508.0
out how to do that and then not to abuse

3505.359 --> 3511.089
it because it does wear you out you

3508.0 --> 3514.14
can't keep on doing that quickly after

3511.089 --> 3516.48
one knot it takes a lot of energy but oh

3514.14 --> 3526.2
yeah

3516.48 --> 3526.2
Georgie is there yep there he goes

3526.84 --> 3536.469
now he's over there yeah

3533.42 --> 3536.469
[Music]

3553.75 --> 3562.72
hmm lore'l Latia ho sounds familiar

3559.3 --> 3567.4
that is indeed professional casting

3562.72 --> 3570.16
focus area right great yeah that is

3567.4 --> 3575.53
indeed what people of that profession

3570.16 --> 3577.92
would be dealing with the most ok the I

3575.53 --> 3577.92
that's

3581.7 --> 3584.39
cool

3605.37 --> 3608.0899999999997
hmm

3623.44 --> 3631.88
no Tom Parker I have no idea I don't

3627.289 --> 3634.969
know if he does QE could as far as I

3631.88 --> 3636.289
know be an individual that is in the

3634.969 --> 3638.4500000000003
same place as I am

3636.289 --> 3641.7490000000003
he basically could be claiming these

3638.45 --> 3643.339
things because he is as good at as but

3641.749 --> 3648.259
couldn't get those things that would be

3643.339 --> 3653.989
presuming some kind of lie I can't yeah

3648.259 --> 3656.18
it said the only I I doubt I think he he

3653.989 --> 3659.329
is who he says he is probably and he

3656.18 --> 3664.8489999999997
does have degrees I don't know I don't

3659.329 --> 3668.059
know about it what I do know however is

3664.849 --> 3670.6090000000004
that the vast majority of what he puts

3668.059 --> 3672.8590000000004
out not necessarily the way he does it

3670.609 --> 3674.93
but what he puts out the the technicals

3672.859 --> 3677.779
of the information is just very correct

3674.93 --> 3682.5789999999997
and he's been the tip of the spear in

3677.779 --> 3685.369
being precise for most of us this not as

3682.579 --> 3687.829
a social example by the way just purely

3685.369 --> 3695.539
on the technical side just to clear that

3687.829 --> 3699.489
up I don't know I just seem kind of like

3695.539 --> 3706.3590000000004
an an eccentric smart guy

3699.489 --> 3708.559
that's how I've come to see it then

3706.359 --> 3714.799
eccentricities don't always have to be

3708.559 --> 3718.219
bizarre or or funny or something no they

3714.799 --> 3725.42
can be just freaking annoying or

3718.219 --> 3728.349
disruptive as well I don't know John QE

3725.42 --> 3728.349
is who he is

3729.12 --> 3739.0299999999997
and yeah I'm just gonna have to deal

3733.54 --> 3741.3
with the facts and drop the character

3739.03 --> 3748.3
attacks because it's not helping anyone

3741.3 --> 3751.21
especially all of you yeah he's a grumpy

3748.3 --> 3753.25
old so but I do love him I don't know is

3751.21 --> 3759.3
he really even that old I don't know how

3753.25 --> 3759.3
old he is no idea he doesn't sound old

3761.22 --> 3765.27
anyway I'm gonna round out the show
