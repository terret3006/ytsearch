124.36 --> 126.92
the rain on

134.959 --> 141.2
it right so hello Zep tappy first in

138.28 --> 144.76
chat fiber outs good to see you

141.2 --> 144.76
clear good to see

147.36 --> 152.8
you it is Saturday the 4 4 of November

153.64 --> 157.72
2023 skipped the show

159.64 --> 165.11999999999998
yesterday cuz I overs slapped a lot I

163.76 --> 169.64
don't

165.12 --> 169.64000000000001
know it was kind of unexpected

172.519 --> 179.0
though right but yeah yesterday it I

176.72 --> 181.68
basically put all the energy in fed and

179.0 --> 183.959
it was much more active there it was a

181.68 --> 183.959
fun

185.92 --> 191.11999999999998
Fed

187.519 --> 194.519
so right but I'm here today I got all

191.12 --> 194.519
the day to myself pretty

196.239 --> 200.64000000000001
much Lo simplye shred

204.68 --> 208.64000000000001
it right so how are you all

208.68 --> 211.68
doing

214.84 --> 219.31900000000002
all this moist is kind of annoying me

217.319 --> 222.319
I've notic that when it's like really

219.319 --> 226.28
raining and all that it just gets moist

222.319 --> 230.959
in the air and it it has this annoying

226.28 --> 233.48
tendency to block my acti tube

230.959 --> 236.12
filters and like tar them all up it's

233.48 --> 240.39999999999998
very annoying but I I figured out a

236.12 --> 241.36
funny way to actually bypass that

240.4 --> 244.36
because I

241.36 --> 245.519
normally put like a paper tip in front

244.36 --> 248.28
of

245.519 --> 251.20000000000002
it but I figured out that if you do the

248.28 --> 253.12
paper tip actually behind it so that the

251.2 --> 255.959
paper tip is actually against the mouth

253.12 --> 260.04
and not the filter that that completely

255.959 --> 261.84000000000003
bypasses this issue so

260.04 --> 264.68
yay who

261.84 --> 267.11999999999995
cares I do because it's really annoying

264.68 --> 270.36
when you're smoking and it's literally

267.12 --> 272.6
just it it clogs

270.36 --> 272.6
right

274.88 --> 282.479
anyway FD is a much better show when I'm

277.44 --> 282.479
on form I like to think so

283.08 --> 286.44
yeah Simply

292.0 --> 298.479
Shredded how much those catch yeah yeah

295.72 --> 298.47900000000004
they do F

298.56 --> 302.56
roads

300.759 --> 305.40000000000003
like I don't want to

302.56 --> 306.88
smoke if I don't have those filters like

305.4 --> 311.479
at

306.88 --> 315.84
all because if I smoke without him like

311.479 --> 315.84
it literally hurts like

316.52 --> 322.52
lasting cuz it's just like all that

319.12 --> 326.199
extra garbage is just not good for my

322.52 --> 328.479
lungs and like I feel

326.199 --> 331.479
it right

328.479 --> 331.479
anyway

333.88 --> 339.039
oh Benjamin was also pretty

336.36 --> 342.47900000000004
badass what's it about

339.039 --> 342.479
again let me

344.639 --> 351.199
check oh yeah I had this part about

347.96 --> 353.19899999999996
Snoop Dog being Anubis that was weird it

351.199 --> 356.68
was kind of weird all over the place

353.199 --> 356.68
yesterday but it was

357.36 --> 366.40000000000003
interesting following tracks in his 1808

361.72 --> 366.40000000000003
Demons episode which was a really good

371.84 --> 378.11999999999995
one all that would have ended up in the

375.08 --> 381.44
lungs right f f Roots well what's even

378.12 --> 386.039
more miraculous is how well the lungs

381.44 --> 386.039
actually are at cleaning all up all that

386.8 --> 393.28000000000003
crap that's even more amazing is that

390.08 --> 397.28
if you just don't smoke it for a while

393.28 --> 397.28
that your lungs really do clean

399.56 --> 405.639
up so I will see it as like yeah it's

403.639 --> 408.759
just like you're eating that garbage or

405.639 --> 410.479
whatever like the the goo the tar and

408.759 --> 414.16
all that and I mean yeah it's super

410.479 --> 417.31899999999996
toxic technically in concentrated form

414.16 --> 420.40000000000003
but your body if you're in a decent

417.319 --> 422.56
condition it will act actually process

420.4 --> 422.56
it

426.12 --> 431.16
all on day 34 lungs feel a lot better oh

430.0 --> 434.56
you quit

431.16 --> 434.56
smoking did you

436.08 --> 441.15999999999997
VI H that's good good in

504.879 --> 511.24
Egyptian god of the dead or

508.24 --> 511.24
something

511.919 --> 517.68
it's basic it's sort of like the Grim

513.76 --> 517.68
Reaper of the egyp

521.8 --> 526.56
pantheon haven't listened to BB since

548.72 --> 555.32
you like the regular cigarette

552.24 --> 557.9590000000001
smokes then I guess an ecigarette might

555.32 --> 560.6400000000001
be a solution cuz regular cigarettes are

557.959 --> 560.64
just really

561.16 --> 565.519
suck but I

563.0 --> 568.12

smoke

617.14 --> 621.0
[Music]

624.12 --> 630.64
want to smoke so badly okay well a good

627.88 --> 633.24
way to stop that from happening is not

630.64 --> 633.24
talking about

633.44 --> 640.399
it so sorry about bringing it up then

680.519 --> 686.12
though so I do make effort physically

687.959 --> 690.959
but

692.44 --> 697.32
I don't know my shoes aren't exactly

694.68 --> 702.3199999999999

mocking your

name

798.079 --> 804.0
okay didn't see it like that but I think

801.8 --> 807.04
it was just trying to make fun maybe a

804.0 --> 807.04
bit awkward

807.76 --> 810.76
whatever

816.95 --> 820.3290000000001
[Music]

823.56 --> 826.399

morning well I don't blame you the

828.76 --> 832.04

836.8 --> 841.959
fiods can you ask some something about

839.72 --> 844.1600000000001
my mom she

841.959 --> 848.4399999999999
was I

844.16 --> 848.4399999999999
guess it's a long time ago

849.0 --> 853.199
but you don't want to bum anyone out

851.6 --> 856.5600000000001
well that's going to be pretty tough

853.199 --> 859.639
bringing up a subject like that but if

856.56 --> 859.6389999999999
you want to know you want to

867.68 --> 870.68

871.47 --> 874.539
[Music]

okay simply sh it take it easy

888.199 --> 893.04
there want then oh

891.0 --> 895.56
okay

893.04 --> 897.68
yes I have a question but I'm not going

895.56 --> 900.68
to tell you what it

897.68 --> 900.68
is

901.759 --> 904.72
thanks that's

903.47 --> 907.0790000000001
[Music]

904.72 --> 910.36
great bring it up and

907.079 --> 913.3599999999999
then not ask the

910.36 --> 913.36
question

927.6 --> 930.6
brilliant

932.11 --> 935.899
[Music]

942.95 --> 949.1690000000001
[Music]

951.959 --> 958.92
I was remembering that Owen did bring up

954.399 --> 961.319
like the inner monologue again up as an

958.92 --> 961.319
as a

967.24 --> 972.6
subject but it was part of the demon

969.48 --> 975.72
episode so I don't I don't remember what

972.6 --> 975.72
the hell he was doing in it

978.079 --> 984.319
yesterday that your mom get angry and

980.36 --> 984.319
freak out and act outside of her normal

984.639 --> 990.519
personality

987.519 --> 990.519
yeah

991.079 --> 998.199
but it's also because

994.24 --> 1001.5600000000001
of well my mom was basically

998.199 --> 1001.56
like yeah this

1002.44 --> 1011.0400000000001
sounds she was like the man of the house

1006.839 --> 1014.8000000000001
basically that's like how we our family

1011.04 --> 1017.48
was and when she got that she basically

1014.8 --> 1019.7589999999999
like well that's when she really lost

1017.48 --> 1022.5600000000001
control

1019.759 --> 1025.72
like sh was already losing control

1022.56 --> 1030.9589999999998
gradually but after that point it was

1025.72 --> 1030.959
like she yeah she flipped out because of

1031.199 --> 1039.199
that and it's not too strange

1034.319 --> 1042.6
because nobody that she knew really had

1039.199 --> 1045.52
any kind of grasp on cancer and how to

1042.6 --> 1049.4399999999998
deal with it like nobody we did not know

1045.52 --> 1052.44
alternative [ __ ] we didn't know

1049.44 --> 1055.16
anything anything I didn't know anything

1052.44 --> 1057.679
my dad didn't know anything my brother

1055.16 --> 1060.3600000000001
absolutely didn't know anything about

1057.679 --> 1062.919
it and

1060.36 --> 1064.9599999999998
so I still remember how she was

1062.919 --> 1068.4
basically asking like on what to do with

1064.96 --> 1071.16
it and I didn't know and I I regret that

1068.4 --> 1071.16
so

1071.84 --> 1079.8799999999999
bad because if I hadn't been such a

1076.0 --> 1085.4
[ __ ] lazy bastard piece of

1079.88 --> 1087.7600000000002
[ __ ] teenager [ __ ] face whiny [ __ ] that

1085.4 --> 1089.679
just never learned anything because I

1087.76 --> 1093.24
was always relying on other people to

1089.679 --> 1098.679
know it if I had actually like done any

1093.24 --> 1102.88
kind of personal responsibility with

1098.679 --> 1102.88
knowledge I might have been able to save

1105.159 --> 1113.5590000000002
her but I hadn't cuz I wasn't a dumb

1108.96 --> 1113.559
[ __ ] teenage lazy piece of

1115.039 --> 1122.28
[ __ ] that didn't take responsibility for

1119.12 --> 1125.3999999999999
anything like I was acting like a

1122.28 --> 1128.039
teenager even

1125.4 --> 1130.48
older I couldn't get a good grasp on

1128.039 --> 1133.24
like real self- responsibility because

1130.48 --> 1136.799
the world was too much for me like it

1133.24 --> 1139.24
genuinely consciously scared

1136.799 --> 1141.08
me so

1139.24 --> 1143.44
getting to that point where I can like

1141.08 --> 1146.799
take responsibility for my own life took

1143.44 --> 1148.679
a very long time and my mother getting

1146.799 --> 1153.4
cancer

1148.679 --> 1156.72
definitely like accelerated that

1153.4 --> 1162.5590000000002
process cuz it it made me realize like

1156.72 --> 1165.4
no you really [ __ ] have to do that

1162.559 --> 1167.24
you really have to do that or see people

1165.4 --> 1172.64
torturously

1167.24 --> 1174.64
die you hear me Arwin you must know you

1172.64 --> 1177.96
must

1174.64 --> 1179.679
know you must take this fight it's a

1177.96 --> 1182.0
fight against the entire world and you

1179.679 --> 1184.72
must take it or everything you love and

1182.0 --> 1187.919
you think you hold close will die and

1184.72 --> 1187.919
wither because of your

1189.4 --> 1195.039
ignorance so yeah that certainly gave me

1192.52 --> 1195.039
a bit of a

1196.44 --> 1202.24
push but uh

1199.799 --> 1204.6399999999999
yeah man the whole cancer situation

1202.24 --> 1208.6
messed my mother up big time she got

1204.64 --> 1211.2800000000002
like panic attacks and anger fits even

1208.6 --> 1214.559
really bizarre some sometimes she like

1211.28 --> 1218.0
got just influenced by the drugs and

1214.559 --> 1220.24
would act almost literally like a

1218.0 --> 1222.64
possessed person would like almost like

1220.24 --> 1222.64
in the

1225.36 --> 1231.32
movies and the weird thing is what she

1228.52 --> 1234.32
did was very unlike her but it's

1231.32 --> 1236.84
actually very close to the effect of

1234.32 --> 1239.36
Rage win if she would even like take

1236.84 --> 1241.1999999999998
another type of voice and all that and

1239.36 --> 1242.039
she wouldn't be conscious about it but

1241.2 --> 1245.4
it's

1242.039 --> 1248.4
not it's because she can't handle she

1245.4 --> 1251.88
could never handle that angry side of

1248.4 --> 1255.679
herself so she would just forget that it

1251.88 --> 1255.679
happened very crazy

1257.12 --> 1260.12
[ __ ]

1274.64 --> 1279.96
right and it like that side is fueled by

1278.08 --> 1283.48
Panic when that happens in a way when

1279.96 --> 1286.559
she had it at least

1283.48 --> 1288.48
because you could literally yell back at

1286.559 --> 1291.72
the top of your lungs and she just

1288.48 --> 1294.6
wouldn't even hear it like she literally

1291.72 --> 1297.039
would be like did something just

1294.6 --> 1299.039
happen because I think that like the

1297.039 --> 1300.919
demons that were in here were just like

1299.039 --> 1304.559
blocking

1300.919 --> 1307.039
everything like everything about reality

1304.559 --> 1309.279
she was so in disharmony with her

1307.039 --> 1312.799
Consciousness about the nature of

1309.279 --> 1315.48
reality as it was that she just like I

1312.799 --> 1319.44
don't want to know anything about

1315.48 --> 1320.279
reality anymore like I am going to live

1319.44 --> 1325.0800000000002
in

1320.279 --> 1325.08
dreams and I don't care if I die

1326.039 --> 1331.279
almost like she didn't want to die but

1328.64 --> 1335.0800000000002
she didn't want to live anymore and it

1331.279 --> 1336.64
also had to do with well divorcing my

1335.08 --> 1339.799
dad

1336.64 --> 1343.2
because though she'd been nagging him

1339.799 --> 1347.679
forever for like two decades drove us

1343.2 --> 1349.72
all nuts she was like obsessed in love

1347.679 --> 1352.919
with it

1349.72 --> 1355.679
like was her one true love and she could

1352.919 --> 1358.5590000000002
never ever let that go like that is

1355.679 --> 1361.72
probably the thing that

1358.559 --> 1363.039
really like in her private space in her

1361.72 --> 1366.88
own

1363.039 --> 1369.1589999999999
personal moments strangled her and she

1366.88 --> 1369.159
let

1376.48 --> 1380.84
it right and this is going to be really

1379.12 --> 1384.039
weird too by the way and what I'm going

1380.84 --> 1387.799
to say about this because so

1384.039 --> 1392.039
atypical you could say that my dad

1387.799 --> 1395.4
divorcing my mom killed her in that

1392.039 --> 1398.559
sense in an indirect way but here's my

1395.4 --> 1402.52
opinion she deserved

1398.559 --> 1405.52
it because she was totally

1402.52 --> 1405.52
irresponsibly

1406.08 --> 1412.36
dependent and like people people warned

1409.36 --> 1417.0
her about that

1412.36 --> 1419.4799999999998
aspect all the time

1417.0 --> 1424.0
colleagues

1419.48 --> 1426.2
friends all their family and she just

1424.0 --> 1431.36
never

1426.2 --> 1435.279
listen so she in a way is like with

1431.36 --> 1435.279
her what do you say

1436.88 --> 1442.159
um

1438.76 --> 1445.52
she was in irrational ways very

1442.159 --> 1448.6000000000001
selfish but she wanted to be selfless

1445.52 --> 1450.96
but she wanted to be like that like a

1448.6 --> 1454.48
hippie dippy

1450.96 --> 1456.96
selflessness so badly that she lit she

1454.48 --> 1456.96
would be

1460.96 --> 1466.52
irrational it's like she did not want to

1464.08 --> 1466.52
adapt

1466.6 --> 1474.6789999999999
to to just how it's logical to deal with

1472.64 --> 1477.8400000000001
people in a

1474.679 --> 1482.3990000000001
way she had her own way for it and she

1477.84 --> 1482.399
could not adapt that at

1484.2 --> 1489.24
all has the timings changed

1487.72 --> 1492.6000000000001
again

1489.24 --> 1493.799

1619.84 --> 1628.52
but look in a way the problem my mother

1625.0 --> 1632.399
had is very similar to my own personal

1628.52 --> 1635.12
problem and is that we got such an

1632.399 --> 1638.36
elaborate inner

1635.12 --> 1642.08
world it's very painful like we can't

1638.36 --> 1642.08
fully adapt to the outside

1643.52 --> 1649.44
world and the way my mother did it was

1646.399 --> 1650.9599999999998
just like

1649.44 --> 1653.8400000000001
awkward in a lot of

1650.96 --> 1656.32
ways and like I didn't like how my

1653.84 --> 1658.52
mother was socially like at all I

1656.32 --> 1660.4399999999998
thought it was extremely embarrassing

1658.52 --> 1663.32

1660.44 --> 1666.2
didn't like oh a no that's like deep in

1663.32 --> 1669.039
my 20s like my mom was just freaking

1666.2 --> 1669.039
embarrassing

1676.519 --> 1681.96
socially

1678.36 --> 1685.4799999999998
she did not have any logical sense of

1681.96 --> 1688.279
composure she would be awkward she would

1685.48 --> 1691.72
like unexpectedly throw personal things

1688.279 --> 1691.72

the ank symbol everybody's seen an ank

2095.879 --> 2100.56

that doesn't symbolize free energy

2100.56 --> 2106.0789999999997
they're idiots there is no symbol for

2103.599 --> 2109.7200000000003
free energy let me be clear because

2106.079 --> 2112.4
there is no free energy now there's

2109.72 --> 2116.24
energy it's not free there is no energy

2112.4 --> 2120.0
is free all energy comes from

2116.24 --> 2122.64
somewhere there is no free

2120.0 --> 2124.839
energy that you can think of it as free

2122.64 --> 2127.7599999999998
and then Rob the place of

2124.839 --> 2131.16
it and then say you got it for free but

2127.76 --> 2134.0200000000004
you are going to notice that other

2131.16 --> 2137.199

2198.16 --> 2204.359
right so yeah the ank is a symbol of

2206.359 --> 2212.359
life and potentially eternal life the

2210.0 --> 2218.68
cycle of Life The

2212.359 --> 2218.68
Reincarnation of life or the

2219.28 --> 2224.96
the spirit life beyond the physical

vessel which they also considered

2224.96 --> 2228.2
Eternal that's what it

2229.0 --> 2236.28
symbolizes and I use the ank as an

2231.839 --> 2236.2799999999997
inspiration too for AA

2238.52 --> 2243.96
symbol

2240.04 --> 2243.96
from those decades

2668.839 --> 2675.64
out yeah get the [ __ ]

2672.559 --> 2679.079
out I'm going to call you a

2675.64 --> 2680.8799999999997
Ballard yeah and if you complain about

2679.079 --> 2684.319
it I kick you the [ __ ]

2680.88 --> 2686.6400000000003
out cuz you are a Ballard if you believe

2684.319 --> 2689.88
in the ball Earth and you still like to

2686.64 --> 2693.1189999999997
hang around my chat you're a

2689.88 --> 2694.96
Ballard there's no way around

2693.119 --> 2697.96
that

2694.96 --> 2697.96
okay

2700.26 --> 2703.489
[Music]

2720.64 --> 2724.8799999999997
the Ballard wasn't the one complaining I

2723.04 --> 2727.88
don't

2724.88 --> 2727.88
care

2728.68 --> 2735.1189999999997
oh T complained about Flur yeah it is

2731.72 --> 2735.1189999999997
annoying when you guys use

2745.559 --> 2753.0400000000004
that but I mean it really like teret I

2749.2 --> 2754.359
mean I wouldn't if ballers call you Flur

2753.04 --> 2757.44
or

2754.359 --> 2761.2
whatever to me is just like

2757.44 --> 2766.119
a look at the little child trying to

2761.2 --> 2768.5589999999997
project their own idiocy onto the

2766.119 --> 2771.559
opponent it's all just a bunch of

2768.559 --> 2772.559
CopyCat hor [ __ ] anyway what Ballers do

2771.559 --> 2774.52
all of

2772.559 --> 2777.079
it because they have no winning

2774.52 --> 2779.48
arguments so they just try to mimic the

2777.079 --> 2780.96
opposition and be the opposition of that

2779.48 --> 2783.68
it's

2780.96 --> 2786.599
pathetic everything we say they like to

2783.68 --> 2789.2799999999997
copy it back onto US

2786.599 --> 2791.2000000000003
because they have no arguments

2789.28 --> 2795.0400000000004
ever

2791.2 --> 2799.1189999999997
nothing so I don't

2795.04 --> 2801.4
care everything they say to to me that's

2799.119 --> 2804.1600000000003
derogatory to a flat earther I just

2801.4 --> 2808.44
laugh at it it's like you're pathetic

2804.16 --> 2808.44
you are dreadfully

2810.04 --> 2818.839
pathetic a loser a loser that can't even

2814.16 --> 2818.839
recognize reality and will project

2819.0 --> 2826.4
everything that they do onto onto the

2822.319 --> 2829.8
reality that they can't even accept is

2826.4 --> 2832.4
real it's pathetic so I'm just laughing

2829.8 --> 2834.8390000000004
at them like in a bit of a s bit of

2832.4 --> 2837.04
sadistic way it is a bit of sadistic

2834.839 --> 2839.7999999999997
laugh I know how much it hurts you see

2837.04 --> 2843.5589999999997
to be that [ __ ] stupid because I used

2839.8 --> 2846.92
to be that stupid and people laughed at

2843.559 --> 2849.76
me too sadistically because they knew

2846.92 --> 2854.079
how much it hurt and that when you're

2849.76 --> 2854.079
that stupid you deserve it you

2855.0 --> 2860.559
see you actually deserve that pain part

2858.079 --> 2863.319
of the problem with that pain is that

2860.559 --> 2866.6800000000003
you keep walking away from

2863.319 --> 2869.96
it that is the

2866.68 --> 2872.319
problem you won't confront the

2869.96 --> 2875.04
reality and that is the

2872.319 --> 2877.0
problem and you project everything all

2875.04 --> 2879.96
of you do

2877.0 --> 2879.96
I used to do

2889.04 --> 2896.4
that I don't have to worry about you

2891.52 --> 2899.4
don't worry I won't I won't worry about

2896.4 --> 2899.4
you

2899.559 --> 2907.0400000000004
yeah I worry about as much about you zap

2903.44 --> 2908.2400000000002
tappy as the mushrooms I see growing

2907.04 --> 2912.88
next to a

2908.24 --> 2912.8799999999997
tree that's how much I worry about

2914.28 --> 2920.3190000000004
you there will be zepes in the chat

2917.76 --> 2925.2400000000002
periodically just like mushrooms will

2920.319 --> 2928.04
grow besides tree periodically yeah it's

2925.24 --> 2928.04
no difference for

2929.92 --> 2935.96
me Ballers rule the world yeah like

2933.079 --> 2938.04
mushrooms do mushrooms rule rule the

2935.96 --> 2941.0
world too there's fungus in all the

2938.04 --> 2943.88
Earth did you not know

2941.0 --> 2945.599
that mushrooms are like the Ballers of

2943.88 --> 2948.559
the of the

2945.599 --> 2950.4
dirt they pop up everywhere and they got

2948.559 --> 2952.88
their roots and

2950.4 --> 2955.319
everything but they do serve an actual

2952.88 --> 2958.96
function

2955.319 --> 2963.119
though but hey if you eat the wrong ones

2958.96 --> 2966.359
you'll get all messed up in the head you

2963.119 --> 2969.119
know just like ballers

2966.359 --> 2972.4
if you bite down on what they tell you

2969.119 --> 2976.48
you'll get just as [ __ ]

2972.4 --> 2976.48
[ __ ] mushrooms full of

2976.72 --> 2982.0
[ __ ] well

2978.92 --> 2982.39
[ __ ] mushrooms do great with [ __ ] they

2982.0 --> 2992.239
love

2982.39 --> 2992.239
[Music]

2994.52 --> 2997.52
it

2998.28 --> 3005.989
[Music]

3017.52 --> 3020.24
all

3018.48 --> 3023.48
right so

3020.24 --> 3027.1189999999997
anyway I might not be a balard I'm still

3023.48 --> 3029.88
freaking poor and I really need support

3027.119 --> 3031.92
guys because I am broke at this point I

3029.88 --> 3035.319
got some food for

3031.92 --> 3038.359
like another two days or

3035.319 --> 3041.359
something and then I'm going to be

3038.359 --> 3041.359
totally

3043.68 --> 3049.52
out so I'd really appreciate to get some

3047.2 --> 3052.4399999999996
more PayPal

3049.52 --> 3056.119
support that would be

3052.44 --> 3059.28
fantastic seems like those extra

3056.119 --> 3062.96
compensation bills that we

3059.28 --> 3064.7200000000003
got because of the enormous price hike

3062.96 --> 3067.0
with electricity I think that they're

3064.72 --> 3070.24
just not doing that anymore cuz they

3067.0 --> 3073.2
used to give like 200 bucks every four

3070.24 --> 3075.0789999999997
months or something and I haven't had

3073.2 --> 3078.04
that

3075.079 --> 3082.799
anymore since

3078.04 --> 3086.2799999999997
May so like I am really screwed here

3082.799 --> 3088.16
financially and I really need support

3086.28 --> 3092.76
for

3088.16 --> 3095.2799999999997
food I really love to to be able to eat

3092.76 --> 3097.119
so I can just keep doing this show and

3095.28 --> 3097.96
be part of Flat Earth debates and all

3097.119 --> 3101.359
that

3097.96 --> 3105.839
and I'd love to

3101.359 --> 3107.96
have people around that really want to

3105.839 --> 3111.0
hear me out on things right hey you want

3107.96 --> 3113.96
to know what is your model Arwin

3111.0 --> 3115.68
everybody fed says that there is no

3113.96 --> 3117.48
model for the globe and there there's no

3115.68 --> 3121.1189999999997
model for the Flat Earth yeah but I got

3117.48 --> 3123.799
a model like yeah it's not I mean it's

3121.119 --> 3125.76
not a model by QE standards but I mean I

3123.799 --> 3128.799
don't even [ __ ] understand what the

3125.76 --> 3132.48
[ __ ] he means when he says model he

3128.799 --> 3134.48
hasn't explained it to me ever he just

3132.48 --> 3136.76
says how nothing is a model that's like

3134.48 --> 3138.52
the only [ __ ] thing he says about it

3136.76 --> 3140.5200000000004
so how the [ __ ] am I supposed to know

3138.52 --> 3143.96
what a model even is when you never say

3140.52 --> 3147.2
what it is qy

3143.96 --> 3149.2
Dick I don't care I'm going to call it

3147.2 --> 3152.5989999999997
model I got a very good conception of

3149.2 --> 3154.8799999999997
how this realm works and it's quite

3152.599 --> 3158.7200000000003
surreal and that's how you know it's

3154.88 --> 3162.48
real because yeah if I design a whole

3158.72 --> 3165.16
thing with things in it then I design it

3162.48 --> 3168.4
in a way that the things within the hole

3165.16 --> 3171.2
would not be capable on typically on

3168.4 --> 3175.359
average to figure out what the hole

3171.2 --> 3180.24
is it's pure designer logic right so

3175.359 --> 3180.24
yeah of course reality is so

3180.44 --> 3186.2000000000003
surreal that it would be rare to even

3183.64 --> 3188.72
come across anybody that would

3186.2 --> 3192.48
understand the physical nature of

3188.72 --> 3195.0789999999997
reality that not even about being able

3192.48 --> 3199.92
to attain the data but just being able

3195.079 --> 3203.559
to grasp what the [ __ ] is going on out

3199.92 --> 3205.6800000000003
there the world what the hell is it what

3203.559 --> 3206.6400000000003
the [ __ ] are the stars in the Sun and

3205.68 --> 3211.64
the

3206.64 --> 3218.04
Moon what is the orientation of the

3211.64 --> 3221.7599999999998
land how far does it go yeah how is it

3218.04 --> 3223.4
is there a loop yeah I think there is I

3221.76 --> 3226.3590000000004
think there is a loop in the realm and

3223.4 --> 3229.319
it's like yeah that defies all the

3226.359 --> 3231.96
typical physical spatial linear

3229.319 --> 3236.799
understanding that people typically have

3231.96 --> 3240.079
in the world and I'd say it's on purpose

3236.799 --> 3243.92
it's on purpose that confusing it has to

3240.079 --> 3250.48
be on purpose the loop has to be there

3243.92 --> 3250.48
and be bitterly confusing to the mind on

3251.16 --> 3257.96
purpose to

3254.319 --> 3261.24
discourage it has to be like that to

3257.96 --> 3261.2400000000002
discourage the

3264.079 --> 3270.4
mind it's like a warning sign like hey

3268.359 --> 3273.92
oh you thought you could grasp it all

3270.4 --> 3277.2000000000003
right well look at this yeah what you

3273.92 --> 3279.119
going to do now now that you've finally

3277.2 --> 3281.359
realized you're stuck in some sort of

3279.119 --> 3283.2400000000002
Wormhole and it's always been like that

3281.359 --> 3286.52
and like you don't know if there's a

3283.24 --> 3288.839
physical reality outside of it at all

3286.52 --> 3290.4
yeah what you going to do now oh you

3288.839 --> 3293.24
could just going to figure out the next

3290.4 --> 3295.48
few things are you little puny human you

3293.24 --> 3299.5989999999997
think you can like back track back

3295.48 --> 3303.04
engineer God's design do you well good

3299.599 --> 3304.44
[ __ ] luck cuz nobody's going to

3303.04 --> 3308.64
understand you

3304.44 --> 3308.64
ever I've been trying for

3313.44 --> 3318.559
years yeah I mean you try and explain to

3316.68 --> 3320.5589999999997
the world like oh yeah the so those

3318.559 --> 3323.2000000000003
Celestial you see yeah that's actually

3320.559 --> 3325.88
non-local

3323.2 --> 3328.4399999999996
Holograms what does that mean

3325.88 --> 3332.7200000000003
yeah yeah I know I

3328.44 --> 3335.28
know it's very confusing isn't it yeah

3332.72 --> 3340.0389999999998
well I think it's supposed to

3335.28 --> 3343.2400000000002
be that confusing it's it's confusing

3340.039 --> 3346.1600000000003
for a reason because everything that is

3343.24 --> 3349.2
is for a

3346.16 --> 3352.24
reason there's nothing left to

3349.2 --> 3357.7599999999998
chance except for the

3352.24 --> 3357.7599999999998
choice of the conscious man men and

3368.48 --> 3372.96
women so

3370.64 --> 3375.839
yeah looping

3372.96 --> 3380.599
rectangular potential for a lot more

3375.839 --> 3380.599
space available North and

3383.76 --> 3389.5200000000004
South that

3386.039 --> 3391.88
and yeah those Celestial lights they're

3389.52 --> 3394.64
not in any position they're not floating

3391.88 --> 3398.48
they're not in the

3394.64 --> 3403.52
firmament yeah they're not

3398.48 --> 3403.52
anywhere they're not things they are

3403.559 --> 3410.039
projections they're holographic

3406.039 --> 3412.6800000000003
projections that uniquely work so that

3410.039 --> 3415.48
they move with the Observer they're like

3412.68 --> 3418.9199999999996
projections in 3D spaces

3415.48 --> 3423.88
itself it's like something that is

3418.92 --> 3428.2400000000002
apparent only to the 3D space

3423.88 --> 3431.039
itself and it has no actual position

3428.24 --> 3433.799
ever under any circumstance do any of

3431.039 --> 3436.7990000000004
the celestial lights have actual

3433.799 --> 3439.92
positions so they are like the

3436.799 --> 3442.4
backdrop backdrop picture for a 3D

3439.92 --> 3445.28
rendering program simulation of 3D

3442.4 --> 3449.599
reality they are the background picture

3445.28 --> 3452.1600000000003
and they are everywhere in

3449.599 --> 3455.0
reality so they are almost like the

3452.16 --> 3457.5589999999997
fourth dimensional backdrop it's the

3455.0 --> 3460.28
backdrop that follows you around yeah

3457.559 --> 3463.2000000000003
and it and light comes from it Shadows

3460.28 --> 3465.3190000000004
come from the background that follows

3463.2 --> 3469.3999999999996
you around

3465.319 --> 3472.0389999999998
yeah the backdrop that follows you

3469.4 --> 3476.799
around casts

3472.039 --> 3476.7990000000004
Shadows based on your observation

3477.079 --> 3485.88
Point that's [ __ ] right deal with

3480.559 --> 3485.88
it deal with The Surreal

3503.72 --> 3506.72
reality

3507.51 --> 3525.6800000000003
[Music]

3523.079 --> 3525.6800000000003
I got a

3529.079 --> 3536.7200000000003
title stacked Dimensions okay yeah maybe

3537.94 --> 3541.139
[Music]

3563.64 --> 3566.64
for

3569.039 --> 3575.6800000000003
yeah I I agree clearly they

3571.799 --> 3579.0389999999998
were Romans were historical revisionists

3575.68 --> 3579.0389999999998
that's what they

3593.64 --> 3596.64
did

3605.64 --> 3609.72
right so could any of you guys oh wait

3608.92 --> 3614.16
never

3609.72 --> 3614.16
mind just the refresh

3615.48 --> 3620.319
weird

3617.28 --> 3623.559
H can you hear that noise somebody's had

3620.319 --> 3626.5589999999997
the brilliant idea to start

3623.559 --> 3626.559
working

3626.64 --> 3629.64
re working on their

3647.16 --> 3652.16
house yeah that's right fots there is no

3652.4 --> 3657.6800000000003
debate there's only endless waffle

3657.799 --> 3661.64
entertainment when it comes to the ball

3660.039 --> 3663.44
because there is no debate you have no

3661.64 --> 3666.5589999999997
arguments you have no proof you have

3663.44 --> 3669.88
nothing you have a bunch of stupid math

3666.559 --> 3670.92
has been dissected as to like what it is

3669.88 --> 3675.359
how it

3670.92 --> 3675.359
works and all is based on the Flat

3677.0 --> 3682.52
Earth if is getting

3680.0 --> 3687.0
boring yeah but it's boring because the

3682.52 --> 3689.92
[ __ ] balarts never do

3687.0 --> 3694.0
anything fed is getting boring because

3689.92 --> 3697.2400000000002
bards are just waiting for it to get

3694.0 --> 3700.16
boring they're just hoping that maybe

3697.24 --> 3702.2
it'll go away if things are just too too

3700.16 --> 3704.96
repetitive and boring maybe then it'll

3702.2 --> 3708.0
go away so they can all forget that that

3704.96 --> 3712.039
happened and pretend like fed never

3708.0 --> 3715.319
existed yeah that's what they want

3712.039 --> 3718.559
that's what they really want cuz it's

3715.319 --> 3720.96
just such an incredible inconvenience

3718.559 --> 3720.96
that it

3736.88 --> 3743.2000000000003
exists that's [ __ ] [ __ ] zeep

3739.76 --> 3745.279
teppy you are projecting

3743.2 --> 3749.359
Bard yeah

3745.279 --> 3751.839
ball Earth is doomed to argue endlessly

3749.359 --> 3756.359
forever with no progress which is

3751.839 --> 3760.4
exactly your position you are arguing

3756.359 --> 3764.0
endlessly forever and you have no

3760.4 --> 3769.079
progress you never do you have no

3764.0 --> 3772.039
rudimentary evidence for the basic

3769.079 --> 3776.0
foundational assumptions that you make

3772.039 --> 3779.48
in your claim to proof yeah you have

3776.0 --> 3781.039
absolutely nothing but you argue

3779.48 --> 3785.119
endlessly

3781.039 --> 3788.1600000000003
though about it without any progress

3785.119 --> 3792.079
it's exactly what the ball position is

3788.16 --> 3796.52
seppy perfect projection

3792.079 --> 3799.92
100% perfect projection there classic

3796.52 --> 3800.92
Bard you can't help it you just can't

3799.92 --> 3805.4
help

3800.92 --> 3808.799
it Satan the Lord of L

3805.4 --> 3811.0
has you in those moments there is

3808.799 --> 3815.44
nothing you can do to change your

3811.0 --> 3817.599
predicament so the Lord of Lies takes

3815.44 --> 3822.44
you in the

3817.599 --> 3825.1600000000003
moment takes the truth and then flips it

3822.44 --> 3829.839
around zeep

3825.16 --> 3833.0389999999998
happy Lord of Lies has taken you in that

3829.839 --> 3834.92
moment can you feel it can you feel

3833.039 --> 3840.2400000000002
Satan's arm

3834.92 --> 3840.2400000000002
reaching through you when you

3857.44 --> 3866.039
lie name something that is progress for

3860.119 --> 3869.88
Flat Earth requiring a flat Baseline

3866.039 --> 3872.1600000000003
for any geometric measurement on Earth Z

3869.88 --> 3874.96
that's progress

3872.16 --> 3877.48
yeah

3874.96 --> 3880.2
realizing we have oh yeah yeah yeah good

3877.48 --> 3882.4
one thanks for the timeout there's so

3880.2 --> 3885.3999999999996
much freaking progress over we can

3882.4 --> 3890.44
literally name the dates on our

3885.4 --> 3894.319
arguments zepa we can name the dates

3890.44 --> 3900.079
when the arguments arrive there is a

3894.319 --> 3902.88
literal recorded historical progress of

3900.079 --> 3907.3590000000004
argumentations for a flat Earth Zep

3902.88 --> 3907.359
tappy you projecting

3908.839 --> 3917.16
ass where is your Bard

3913.0 --> 3917.16
progress projecting

3923.079 --> 3926.079
ass

3927.44 --> 3932.799
yeah that's right Black Swan year at the

3929.599 --> 3932.799
seent it never

3934.039 --> 3939.92
stops and it started out with the

3937.48 --> 3942.64
optical slant I still remember that it's

3939.92 --> 3944.92
not really relevant that much but it was

3942.64 --> 3948.839
a nice Discovery at the

3944.92 --> 3951.92
time progress endless progress it just

3948.839 --> 3954.799
keeps on coming yeah even my

3951.92 --> 3956.6800000000003
understanding of the non-local holograph

3954.799 --> 3961.839
celestials has

3956.68 --> 3964.96
made fantastic progress in the

3961.839 --> 3967.7599999999998
overall my understanding of it and my

3964.96 --> 3971.88
ability to explain its nature and be

3967.76 --> 3975.119
more confident while I explain it which

3971.88 --> 3975.119
helps I

3975.44 --> 3980.7200000000003
take how comprehensible it is because

3979.039 --> 3982.96
anything that's brought by somebody

3980.72 --> 3984.5589999999997
that's confident about the thing that

3982.96 --> 3987.799
he's talking about

3984.559 --> 3987.799
is going to be received

3989.68 --> 3997.0789999999997
better and see the W yeah

3994.2 --> 3999.68
well maybe it's not even required zap

3997.079 --> 4001.2400000000002
tappy I think that people can just learn

3999.68 --> 4003.64
it very

4001.24 --> 4005.9199999999996
easily it just somebody has to tell it

4003.64 --> 4005.92
to

4007.2 --> 4014.5989999999997
them you don't need a curriculum you see

4010.0 --> 4018.119
we don't have stupid math Wizardry with

4014.599 --> 4023.4
switch root tricks of the

4018.119 --> 4025.88
data as part of our construction and

4023.4 --> 4027.6800000000003
understanding of Flat Earth so there

4025.88 --> 4030.88
there is not really that much of a

4027.68 --> 4033.2
curriculum to it

4030.88 --> 4037.6800000000003
yeah I mean your

4033.2 --> 4039.96
balard cosmology requires a whole

4037.68 --> 4042.68
education to make it

4039.96 --> 4045.599
work we know about

4042.68 --> 4048.48
that you can definitely have a

4045.599 --> 4050.92
curriculum on stupid [ __ ] space

4048.48 --> 4053.119
mechanics that makes no sense and it's

4050.92 --> 4056.64
based on

4053.119 --> 4058.76
outdated Concepts that have literally

4056.64 --> 4062.16
officially been declared outdated yet

4058.76 --> 4064.8390000000004
they're still being imployed in the

4062.16 --> 4068.3999999999996
explanations supposed modernized

4064.839 --> 4072.52
explanations that still utilize out ofd

4068.4 --> 4075.44
mechanics it's so pathetic it's

4072.52 --> 4077.96
unbelievable that not everybody sees it

4075.44 --> 4080.2400000000002
like every child should be able to just

4077.96 --> 4082.44
stare at it and realize like this is

4080.24 --> 4085.0389999999998
[ __ ] hor

4082.44 --> 4087.559
[ __ ] but unfortunately very little

4085.039 --> 4092.2400000000002
children they love our

4087.559 --> 4095.039
[ __ ] they love crazy weird

4092.24 --> 4097.199
tricks and then imagine unleash their

4095.039 --> 4099.279
entire imagination upon it right and

4097.199 --> 4101.08
that's why it works so well it's like as

4099.279 --> 4102.92
a little child you'll face it and then

4101.08 --> 4105.0
you have the choice are you going to

4102.92 --> 4107.799
love this dream or are you just going to

4105.0 --> 4109.44
reject it because you know it's wrong

4107.799 --> 4110.96
and guess what a lot of children

4109.44 --> 4115.4
including

4110.96 --> 4117.08
myself we embrace the dream of it and we

4115.4 --> 4119.679
fall in love with

4117.08 --> 4122.199
it even though there's absolutely no

4119.679 --> 4125.0
evidence for it and it's all just hor

4122.199 --> 4127.08
[ __ ] it's a fantastic little Story I

4125.0 --> 4130.159
mean it's it's just like Lord of the

4127.08 --> 4132.5199999999995
Rings fantastic story I love it love

4130.159 --> 4134.679
thinking about it love thinking about

4132.52 --> 4136.88
everything within it

4134.679 --> 4138.679
like regularly it's just like oh yeah

4136.88 --> 4141.88
Lord of the Rings this Lord of the Rings

4138.679 --> 4145.679
that location what would they do right

4141.88 --> 4151.04
it's not a real place

4145.679 --> 4154.56
though huh yeah and neither is outer

4151.04 --> 4157.159
space and the ball

4154.56 --> 4159.719
Earth I can still think about the

4157.159 --> 4162.48
universe like that I can still think of

4159.719 --> 4165.52
this imaginary place and how it's

4162.48 --> 4167.718999999999
supposed to work and all the gaps of

4165.52 --> 4170.52
information about how it works that

4167.719 --> 4173.64
don't really are not really allowed to

4170.52 --> 4177.159000000001
be used anymore yet it's still

4173.64 --> 4179.319
there and it's like look at this crazy

4177.159 --> 4182.679
playground and some people think this is

4179.319 --> 4187.799
actually real it's amazing amazing how

4182.679 --> 4189.52
the imagination works I know it's not

4187.799 --> 4192.44
real

4189.52 --> 4195.6
though I know that

4192.44 --> 4199.239
now but it is

4195.6 --> 4200.159000000001
amazing and amazingly entertaining what

4199.239 --> 4203.28
it

4200.159 --> 4205.96
does to people's

4203.28 --> 4210.44
minds especially those that believe it's

4205.96 --> 4210.44
real it's absolutely ridiculous what it

4222.4 --> 4228.759999999999
does right anyway if you're enjoying the

4225.88 --> 4233.04
Flat Earth early bird show I would

4228.76 --> 4233.04
really appreciate it to get some

4236.719 --> 4243.0
support I want

4239.08 --> 4243.0
support I think I deserve

4248.76 --> 4256.76
it and I need it cuz otherwise I won't

4251.92 --> 4259.36
be eating if in a not too

4256.76 --> 4262.52
distant time from

4259.36 --> 4266.599999999999
now so I'd really appreciate to get some

4262.52 --> 4266.6
support so that I can

4270.44 --> 4276.5599999999995
eat diversion R is the other 93 million

4273.679 --> 4276.56
miles

4277.199 --> 4282.5599999999995
yeah it's ridiculous but I mean like all

4280.36 --> 4285.5599999999995
these distances are

4282.56 --> 4285.56
ridiculous

4288.12 --> 4293.84
it a lot of it is just a giant Ponzi

4290.88 --> 4293.84
scheme of

4294.44 --> 4300.48
numbers right and this is by the way

4297.239 --> 4302.879999999999
also what I think is like part of the

4300.48 --> 4305.44
the Jew magic yeah it's not even

4302.88 --> 4308.159000000001
necessarily Jew it's it's just the

4305.44 --> 4310.5599999999995
numbers Magic like you can have

4308.159 --> 4315.5599999999995
infinitely large numbers but physical

4310.56 --> 4320.120000000001
reality doesn't have Infinity

4315.56 --> 4322.88
right so you could imagine 30 or 93

4320.12 --> 4325.4
million miles but in reality there is no

4322.88 --> 4328.4400000000005
93 million

4325.4 --> 4332.36
miles there's no physical existing

4328.44 --> 4332.36
distance like that you

4333.88 --> 4338.719
see there is no such distance in

4339.28 --> 4344.159
existence about anything it's not just

4342.36 --> 4345.96
like oh the sun isn't actually that

4344.159 --> 4348.879999999999
distance it's a non-local hologram it

4345.96 --> 4351.2390000000005
has no actual distance it will move with

4348.88 --> 4355.159000000001
the Observer at all

4351.239 --> 4355.159
times will cast

4355.719 --> 4361.679
shadows in relation to how the Observer

4359.719 --> 4365.44
sees

4361.679 --> 4368.56
it yeah it has no actual

4365.44 --> 4371.919999999999
distance and there is no 93 million

4368.56 --> 4375.56
miles distance in physical

4371.92 --> 4377.84
existence there's nothing that is there

4375.56 --> 4381.159000000001
is no such distance available there's no

4377.84 --> 4383.52
such space available for such a distance

4381.159 --> 4388.719
to be in

4383.52 --> 4392.400000000001
existence in any form yeah 93 million

4388.719 --> 4395.92
miles May simply exceed the amount of

4392.4 --> 4398.4
physical space available that

4395.92 --> 4403.4400000000005
exists

4398.4 --> 4406.638999999999
yeah cuz the realm though humongous is

4403.44 --> 4406.638999999999
is not that

4418.239 --> 4425.5199999999995
big now fire it's not thick it's just

4423.0 --> 4428.36
condition he conditioned with the stupid

4425.52 --> 4430.92
ass tricks right if you just say a bunch

4428.36 --> 4432.92
of magic words then it makes it work

4430.92 --> 4437.36
that's what he's doing right now that's

4432.92 --> 4441.4800000000005
what they all do right Ballers are

4437.36 --> 4443.5199999999995
magicians that fool themselves and not

4441.48 --> 4446.718999999999
the ones they're talking to yeah that's

4443.52 --> 4449.84
how they work they have a little

4446.719 --> 4451.8
magician math nonsense tricks that are

4449.84 --> 4454.76
blatantly nonsense and incorrectly

4451.8 --> 4459.88
sourced and all that that they use to

4454.76 --> 4462.56
make it work to them in that moment

4459.88 --> 4466.32
other people can see this is complete

4462.56 --> 4470.04
horeshit you're just deluding yourself

4466.32 --> 4473.36
yeah you are we can prove that you are

4470.04 --> 4477.84
but you'll do it anyway because it's not

4473.36 --> 4482.96
there for you to prove yourself towards

4477.84 --> 4488.360000000001
us it's there to prove to

4482.96 --> 4491.159
you it's only there to fool you

4488.36 --> 4496.159
balard and you're the only one that is

4491.159 --> 4499.0
being fooled by your B hard trick you

4496.159 --> 4501.159
see and you can laugh about it all day

4499.0 --> 4502.52
long and gigle and project and stutter

4501.159 --> 4505.92
and all

4502.52 --> 4508.639
that you're the only one that is being

4505.92 --> 4512.6
fooled in the

4508.639 --> 4515.1990000000005
end you are the one that the the stupid

4512.6 --> 4518.719
little trick you roll out is meant for

4515.199 --> 4520.799999999999
it's meant for you it's meant to fool

4518.719 --> 4525.44
yourself zpp

4520.8 --> 4528.28
tappy I know it does that because I can

4525.44 --> 4532.48
simulate a baller I used to be one that

4528.28 --> 4535.8
is exactly what it is the tricks you get

4532.48 --> 4540.159
handed down on how it's supposed to be

4535.8 --> 4540.159000000001
are there to fool

4546.4 --> 4551.32
yourself yeah you take it as a

4548.44 --> 4553.48
compliment Z tappy nobody gives a [ __ ]

4551.32 --> 4556.96
about your little twists that you like

4553.48 --> 4559.879999999999
to think you do in your delusion of

4556.96 --> 4562.32
superiority in the moment you're

4559.88 --> 4565.159000000001
completely

4562.32 --> 4567.239
disected you're a [ __ ] Ballard you

4565.159 --> 4571.4
have no arguments all the arguments that

4567.239 --> 4576.48
you roll forth you only use to convince

4571.4 --> 4576.48
yourself cuz nobody else is buying it

4582.12 --> 4587.639
nobody

4583.96 --> 4587.639
nobody's buying it zip

4589.159 --> 4594.599999999999
nobody and no person in this [ __ ]

4592.04 --> 4597.639
world would ever take any form of

4594.6 --> 4602.4400000000005
intellectual argument from a person that

4597.639 --> 4606.0
uses Cali Miro as an as an icon yeah no

4602.44 --> 4609.5599999999995
[ __ ] person in this world with an IQ

4606.0 --> 4611.96
higher than 60 would ever take an

4609.56 --> 4616.4400000000005
intellectual argument from a person that

4611.96 --> 4619.52
uses Cali Miro as their icon okay that's

4616.44 --> 4622.239
on top of the actual analyz truth that I

4619.52 --> 4625.360000000001
just rolled out about what just happened

4622.239 --> 4627.638999999999
and what you just did yeah that's on top

4625.36 --> 4627.639
of

4642.0 --> 4645.0
that

4646.76 --> 4652.4800000000005
nobody else anybody that's watching this

4649.96 --> 4655.52
yeah and this video just like like the

4652.48 --> 4656.48
video from two days ago we have at least

4655.52 --> 4661.719
200

4656.48 --> 4665.08
viewers and none of them will watch this

4661.719 --> 4669.52
part and think that you actually have an

4665.08 --> 4671.6
argument zpp tappy nobody except other

4669.52 --> 4675.679
[ __ ] ball Tarts that are in on the

4671.6 --> 4678.88
scam of self illusion like you are cuz

4675.679 --> 4682.36
that's what a balard religion religious

4678.88 --> 4685.719
idiot does that's what they do it's the

4682.36 --> 4687.36
religion of self

4685.719 --> 4690.08
delusion

4687.36 --> 4693.4
provably

4690.08 --> 4695.679
traceably yeah but I mean it's a

4693.4 --> 4698.04
religion of self- delusion so you don't

4695.679 --> 4701.1990000000005
even have to hide that it is a religion

4698.04 --> 4705.76
of self- delusion the religion of self

4701.199 --> 4710.32
delusion will hide it itself from you by

4705.76 --> 4714.08
you partaking in it it hides

4710.32 --> 4717.4
itself you do it you don't realize you

4714.08 --> 4721.76
do it other people will see that you do

4717.4 --> 4725.36
it but you want as you do it and that's

4721.76 --> 4728.84
part of how the Ballard religion works

4725.36 --> 4731.239
and we all know that we study that we've

4728.84 --> 4735.76
been studying it for years me personally

4731.239 --> 4738.36
I've been very we meticulously studying

4735.76 --> 4743.04
this psychological

4738.36 --> 4743.04
pattern for years now almost a

4755.239 --> 4759.879999999999
decade yeah I like to call it

4757.719 --> 4763.639
gaslighting

4759.88 --> 4765.84
yourself and then everybody technically

4763.639 --> 4768.4400000000005
impossible you can't gas light

4765.84 --> 4770.4400000000005
yourself yeah but that's that's part of

4768.44 --> 4772.879999999999
the reason why I like to call it

4770.44 --> 4775.28
gaslighting yourself because it's so

4772.88 --> 4778.8
ridiculous the notion of it is

4775.28 --> 4781.48
ridiculous yeah gaslighting trying to

4778.8 --> 4785.52
make somebody think they're crazy by

4781.48 --> 4787.799999999999
continually turning the lights on when

4785.52 --> 4790.320000000001
they think that they've turned it off

4787.8 --> 4794.1990000000005
how the [ __ ] can you do that on yourself

4790.32 --> 4796.599999999999
well it only works if you're a balard

4794.199 --> 4801.08
yeah because a

4796.6 --> 4803.84
balard will have somebody on the

4801.08 --> 4806.719
phone and then talk to them say like I

4803.84 --> 4810.8
don't get it how the hell are these

4806.719 --> 4813.6
lights always turning on I turn them off

4810.8 --> 4816.88
look I'm see I'm turning it off and then

4813.6 --> 4819.400000000001
later they call it Le what happened

4816.88 --> 4822.36
again right and then the person might be

4819.4 --> 4823.92
very much like wow this is really weird

4822.36 --> 4827.04
is there somebody else that lives there

4823.92 --> 4829.88
that might be gaslighting you no no I'm

4827.04 --> 4832.04
here all alone and it only happens when

4829.88 --> 4836.28
I'm alone like

4832.04 --> 4836.28
okay well are you a

4836.639 --> 4840.8
Ballard uh well yeah of course the

4839.0 --> 4843.32
Earth's ball you

4840.8 --> 4846.56
know

4843.32 --> 4849.759999999999
oh okay well then I know what's

4846.56 --> 4851.52
happening you're gaslighting yourself

4849.76 --> 4855.6
you're a ballart and they do that all

4851.52 --> 4860.56
the time so you're literally calling me

4855.6 --> 4862.400000000001
trying to give out this this scene make

4860.56 --> 4865.679
this scene about like oh somebody's

4862.4 --> 4869.638999999999
doing this to me when you are

4865.679 --> 4873.159
obviously turning the light off yourself

4869.639 --> 4875.12
and then somehow turning off your memory

4873.159 --> 4877.719
to think that you don't understand how

4875.12 --> 4880.08
that's happened when you clearly did it

4877.719 --> 4882.36
yeah you gas lit yourself it's the most

4880.08 --> 4885.28
ridiculous thing a person could ever do

4882.36 --> 4889.48
in life and you're doing it cuz you're a

4885.28 --> 4891.36
Bard and Barts Gaslight themselves cuz

mechanics from

5201.4 --> 5205.199
yesterday what did you guys

5207.52 --> 5215.280000000001
think the Dilemma that I gave right

5212.719 --> 5219.4
do we create it or is it simply

5215.28 --> 5219.4
announced to us which one is

5225.76 --> 5231.360000000001
it by the way I'm pretty much doing

5229.08 --> 5232.6
exactly like what I envisioned that

5231.36 --> 5235.4
would

5232.6 --> 5238.2390000000005
happen yes that's like the weirdest part

5235.4 --> 5240.5599999999995
is that kind of something like this was

5238.239 --> 5244.4
sort of like a tape recorder slightly

5240.56 --> 5246.8
played for a little bit while I was

5244.4 --> 5249.04
praying doing the

5246.8 --> 5250.92
technique like a little announcement

5249.04 --> 5252.88
like a little tape record you get like

5250.92 --> 5254.28
oh something like this this is sort of

5252.88 --> 5256.1990000000005
the form of what's going to happen the

5254.28 --> 5259.119
form and the

5256.199 --> 5263.32
energy huh and it's happening it's

5259.119 --> 5263.32
exactly like like it

5265.56 --> 5268.84
felt pretty

5271.119 --> 5276.4
amazing

5272.88 --> 5276.400000000001
hey flatter Sage good to see

5277.44 --> 5282.719
you and are you talking about

5280.56 --> 5284.400000000001
visualization and making impact on

5282.719 --> 5288.44
reality

5284.4 --> 5293.159
well that's one way of looking at

5288.44 --> 5296.5199999999995
it what I'm saying is am I creating it

5293.159 --> 5299.159
or is it simply announcing itself to me

5296.52 --> 5300.719
and I am attuning to what is inevitable

5299.159 --> 5303.159
in to

5300.719 --> 5305.76
come see

5303.159 --> 5305.759999999999

whatever I don't really get it though I

5463.04 --> 5467.92
haven't really watched through those

5464.84 --> 5469.77
videos but you're doing some sort of

5467.92 --> 5471.6
political activism I

5469.77 --> 5475.4400000000005
[Music]

5471.6 --> 5478.4400000000005
think Spirit mechanics

5475.44 --> 5478.44
thing

5480.76 --> 5483.76
yeah

5485.04 --> 5489.5199999999995
you get 30 notifications from balart

5487.36 --> 5491.679
well you can turn the notifications off

5489.52 --> 5491.679
you

5494.239 --> 5504.48
know you don't have to like get those

5499.239 --> 5504.48

5504.6 --> 5509.679
comments I only get notifications for

5507.32 --> 5513.759999999999
new videos now and I'll have to check

5509.679 --> 5513.76
the comments manually

5522.159 --> 5529.48
and I mean I think you guys got wrenches

5524.88 --> 5532.2390000000005
so if you get stupid Ballard whining in

5529.48 --> 5536.44

5532.239 --> 5538.718999999999
those did you know that you can shove

5536.44 --> 5542.08
them on the back

5538.719 --> 5546.8
burner so they get into the h hidden

5542.08 --> 5550.6
list that I can then unhide or delete

5546.8 --> 5554.6
permanently as if having a rench you can

5550.6 --> 5558.4400000000005
remove Ballard troll

5554.6 --> 5558.4400000000005

to throw away all my comments because

5583.119 --> 5588.32
it's mostly just [ __ ] trolls ruining

5586.119 --> 5590.4
everything but if you turn the

5588.32 --> 5594.0
notifications off

5590.4 --> 5597.44
for response responses

5594.0 --> 5599.76
and in comments you can turn those off

5597.44 --> 5602.759999999999
then you don't get like a thousand troll

5599.76 --> 5605.56
popup [ __ ] comments in your

5602.76 --> 5609.159000000001
notification list cuz I get it that's

5605.56 --> 5614.280000000001
really like I have a Channel with

5609.159 --> 5616.96
1768 shows at least so I have to turn

5614.28 --> 5619.119
off that notification or literally I

5616.96 --> 5622.8
couldn't find the

5619.119 --> 5626.08
show because I still get troll ass wipes

5622.8 --> 5627.84
that leave comments like on on shows

5626.08 --> 5631.04
like thousands of

5627.84 --> 5632.8
like on show 700 or whatever they leave

5631.04 --> 5635.6
comments all over the

5632.8 --> 5638.84
place troll

5635.6 --> 5642.4800000000005
comments a lot of

5638.84 --> 5644.679
them but eventually I do go to like

5642.48 --> 5647.4
YouTube studio and there I just like

5644.679 --> 5647.4
clean it all

5647.92 --> 5654.639
up but at least I can just still see

5651.84 --> 5656.4400000000005
like oh this show is about to go live or

5654.639 --> 5659.8
oh this show just went live because it

5656.44 --> 5663.48
isn't like list of 20 stupid troll

5659.8 --> 5663.4800000000005
comments in the way

5663.52 --> 5666.92
and so I get it you didn't want to

5665.6 --> 5670.159000000001
comment because otherwise your

5666.92 --> 5671.679
notifications would get all clogged I

5670.159 --> 5673.48
get it well you can turn those

5671.679 --> 5675.88
notifications off and then you don't

5673.48 --> 5680.199
have to worry about getting clogged so

5675.88 --> 5680.1990000000005
much so I recommend you do

5690.48 --> 5693.48
that

5695.84 --> 5701.639
Arn's trolls AR yeah my troll those

5698.6 --> 5704.52
trolls the the real trolls they're just

5701.639 --> 5707.76
Negative they just say everything sucks

5704.52 --> 5711.88
those trolls are just like everything

5707.76 --> 5711.88
sucks they're probably not real

5712.4 --> 5720.159
people if they were that's that's even

5716.0 --> 5722.719
scarer sometimes it's like you know us

5720.159 --> 5724.5599999999995
guys we like the think that that those

5722.719 --> 5727.0
people a lot of them that they're like

5724.56 --> 5728.360000000001
oh they Shield right this is so [ __ ]

5727.0 --> 5730.88
this is so

5728.36 --> 5736.28
ridiculous that can't be real somebody

5730.88 --> 5740.52
has to be like tasked to do it like

5736.28 --> 5742.96
that but unfortunately reality is quite

5740.52 --> 5746.84
surreal and

5742.96 --> 5749.719
so people are actually that messed

5746.84 --> 5752.92
up nobody stopped them from becoming

5749.719 --> 5755.52
that messed up their parents didn't stop

5752.92 --> 5757.679
them their friends didn't if they even

5755.52 --> 5760.320000000001
have any their colleagues didn't and so

5757.679 --> 5764.0
they are just that messed up and they

5760.32 --> 5764.0
just survive somehow all they

5767.44 --> 5773.839999999999
like those people exist it really they

5770.56 --> 5776.320000000001
are that it's not a act it's it's those

5773.84 --> 5778.6
people are really that [ __ ] and they

5776.32 --> 5780.32
feel really terrible and they get all

5778.6 --> 5784.56
these

5780.32 --> 5789.5599999999995
freaking heart issues probably and like

5784.56 --> 5794.159000000001
stress and SK dude they

5789.56 --> 5797.04
just survive somehow being that

5794.159 --> 5801.119
[ __ ] and nobody stops them from being

5797.04 --> 5803.719
that [ __ ] nobody even yeah it's

5801.119 --> 5806.679
like because they're not provably

5803.719 --> 5808.8
hurting themselves right I mean if you

5806.679 --> 5812.1990000000005
like cut yourself or whatever like it's

5808.8 --> 5814.2390000000005
like oh oh suicidal oh oh oh we have to

5812.199 --> 5815.678999999999
protect him from hurting himself but if

5814.239 --> 5818.04
you're all day long

5815.679 --> 5821.56
like I hate

5818.04 --> 5824.56
you you suck let me get some more

5821.56 --> 5827.4400000000005
disgusting food and disgusting

5824.56 --> 5829.4800000000005
drinks they are like oh that's just a

5827.44 --> 5834.199
person that's really miserable he's not

5829.48 --> 5834.199
slowly killing themselves or anything

5834.96 --> 5844.32
right so yeah that's what they

5840.199 --> 5846.719
do they're basically suicidal but

5844.32 --> 5850.5599999999995
they're just doing it too

5846.719 --> 5854.88
slowly to be legally

5850.56 --> 5859.719

5854.88 --> 5859.719
are we call them maggots for that

5864.58 --> 5868.32
[Music]

5895.88 --> 5902.56
meat they just start like trying to eat

5900.36 --> 5906.96
something Al lot

5902.56 --> 5906.96
KN that's the kind of maggots they

5908.28 --> 5912.639

5960.239 --> 5965.638999999999
have a normal conver

5962.88 --> 5969.28

little mean

6049.92 --> 6056.599
here

6052.199 --> 6056.598999999999
right but I do really want a

6056.84 --> 6060.08
PayPal this

6063.48 --> 6068.678999999999
weekend do I have a pattern or a

6066.04 --> 6074.639
practice with my visualization yeah

6068.679 --> 6074.639
duh it's a very specific set of

6079.52 --> 6083.119000000001
routines it's quite

6084.56 --> 6087.829000000001
[Music]

6096.88 --> 6101.36
elaborate you are just okay

6103.12 --> 6106.22
[Music]

6109.84 --> 6112.84
Batman

6159.599 --> 6163.8
hey Jason mccac good to see

6169.76 --> 6172.76
you

6178.599 --> 6184.2390000000005
n Tesla was really big on

6181.719 --> 6187.2390000000005
visualization like

6184.239 --> 6190.04
what for his engineering yeah that makes

6187.239 --> 6190.04
sense

6192.36 --> 6198.92
sure visualization is extremely useful

6195.56 --> 6198.92
for engineering and

6199.679 --> 6202.679
design

6213.28 --> 6218.08
like it was really important well I bet

6215.84 --> 6218.08
it

6229.679 --> 6232.679
was

6254.08 --> 6258.0
can anything about Tesla be believed

6256.4 --> 6263.839999999999
does anybody

6258.0 --> 6263.84
know believed why would believe

6264.8 --> 6270.400000000001
anything what's the point of believing

6267.56 --> 6274.1990000000005
anything fod either it's true or it's

6270.4 --> 6274.199
not true why would you believe

6276.96 --> 6285.679
it Tesla was

6280.08 --> 6291.159
obviously a LightWave re fire and

6285.679 --> 6294.4400000000005
ethereum so he is wrong about it and

6291.159 --> 6298.36
he basically s side steps the scientific

6294.44 --> 6300.44
method even by doing

6298.36 --> 6303.5199999999995
it like

6300.44 --> 6306.32
he's he's basically getting sloppy with

6303.52 --> 6308.679
physics in his own way now not that he

6306.32 --> 6311.719
really like he's a master of electricity

6308.679 --> 6313.639
so he didn't really follow like he

6311.719 --> 6316.96
didn't really care even that much it's

6313.639 --> 6319.4800000000005
not like an academic in that sense he

6316.96 --> 6321.199
was just an engineer with his electric

6319.48 --> 6324.36
works

6321.199 --> 6328.799999999999
but he absolutely reified ether and

6324.36 --> 6332.28
light being a wave he did that and you

6328.8 --> 6333.4800000000005
can thank partially that probably along

6332.28 --> 6337.599
with a whole bunch of other people that

6333.48 --> 6340.5199999999995
were doing it for physics now being

6337.599 --> 6343.2390000000005
encoded programmed with this

6340.52 --> 6345.599
misconception of light being like a wave

6343.239 --> 6348.799999999999
with all the properties being described

6345.599 --> 6351.119000000001
as frequency and wav like and all that

6348.8 --> 6353.76
which is just completely confusing the

6351.119 --> 6353.759999999999
[ __ ] out of

6354.22 --> 6358.62
[Music]

6360.52 --> 6366.400000000001
everything you're scared of the trolls

6363.88 --> 6370.8
why are you

6366.4 --> 6370.799999999999
what why are you scared of the

6379.4 --> 6385.4
trolls

6381.76 --> 6385.400000000001
who are you why did you even find

6393.88 --> 6399.4800000000005
me sounds like you are a troll with the

6396.92 --> 6399.4800000000005
name like

6404.32 --> 6408.88
that wave does having speed yes and

6407.239 --> 6412.4
light doesn't have a speed it's not a

6408.88 --> 6412.400000000001
wave it doesn't have a speed

6413.84 --> 6416.1990000000005
that's

6418.639 --> 6427.599
right videos about me or I appear what

6423.239 --> 6432.28
why would you be afraid to appear in the

6427.599 --> 6435.599
chat of a of my show that is being

6432.28 --> 6439.44
leeched by some stupid ass troll that

6435.599 --> 6441.92
barely even makes a point I mean you're

6439.44 --> 6443.839999999999
not afraid of those stupid Troll videos

6441.92 --> 6447.679
that are being made about me right

6443.84 --> 6447.679
because those are so

6449.239 --> 6456.718999999999
lame like they don't have

6453.52 --> 6459.96
anything I've tried to watch a couple of

6456.719 --> 6462.639
them and I wasn't even angry I was just

6459.96 --> 6465.4800000000005
disappointed that they they're not even

6462.639 --> 6468.2390000000005
freaking creative enough to figure me

6465.48 --> 6471.638999999999
out on how to bully me properly they're

6468.239 --> 6475.48
so [ __ ] pathetic these trolls people

6471.639 --> 6478.4400000000005
they can't even make a proper bullying

6475.48 --> 6481.08
video and I don't even make those in

6478.44 --> 6485.32
order to know how to be good at that I

6481.08 --> 6487.159
just know when something's really shitty

6485.32 --> 6488.719
like what Sean Hawkins does when he

6487.159 --> 6493.48
makes videos it's

6488.719 --> 6497.76
like like it's so lame it's it's not

6493.48 --> 6500.839999999999
even entertaining it's just like a

6497.76 --> 6503.92
dumbfounded accusation based on an

6500.84 --> 6506.679
obvious misunderstanding on your part

6503.92 --> 6508.599
about what is even being talked about if

6506.679 --> 6512.8
anything if not just

6508.599 --> 6516.52
like blank statement I just it's bad no

6512.8 --> 6519.28
reason like that happens too it's so

6516.52 --> 6521.320000000001
lame it's like like these trolls they're

6519.28 --> 6525.88
not even like criticizing me to death

6521.32 --> 6530.799999999999
they're just laming me to death they're

6525.88 --> 6533.4800000000005
just lame viewing like watching it and

6530.8 --> 6535.360000000001
then making a lame nonsensical response

6533.48 --> 6539.638999999999
video or something and that's supposed

6535.36 --> 6542.0
to do something or is it just proving

6539.639 --> 6544.52
that they're all [ __ ] in comparison

6542.0 --> 6546.639
to me I don't get it man I don't even

6544.52 --> 6549.92
get why these trolls make these stupid

6546.639 --> 6552.28
videos I just don't understand it it's

6549.92 --> 6552.28
so

6559.119 --> 6562.119
pointless

6564.32 --> 6570.4
yeah I know ter it I know I figured that

6572.4 --> 6578.049999999999
out I mean the guy is obviously a troll

6575.28 --> 6580.159

right away oh he didn't see

6594.76 --> 6599.4400000000005
me and then they just don't come back

6597.119 --> 6603.92
the next day it's like they're [ __ ]

6599.44 --> 6607.44
insane These Guys these guys with their

6888.679 --> 6892.599

put anybody in jail for the jab or

6988.639 --> 6995.0
whatever like I don't get it why are you

7330.199 --> 7336.4
why you put him on that in that place

7333.4 --> 7336.4
ter I just don't get

7336.599 --> 7340.96

7398.679 --> 7405.639
I'm just weirded out here like no teret

7402.32 --> 7410.36
you are being overly angry you really

7405.639 --> 7412.84
are you are provably being overly angry

7410.36 --> 7415.239
like what the [ __ ] did Elon Musk do that

7412.84 --> 7418.159000000001
he that Wars that he goes to jail

7415.239 --> 7420.919999999999
immediately compared to all these other

7418.159 --> 7424.119
[ __ ] people that have provably done

7420.92 --> 7427.559
much worse why the hell Elon Musk what

7424.119 --> 7427.558999999999
the [ __ ] did he ever do to

7427.639 --> 7433.679
you this besides being just another one

7430.639 --> 7437.32
of the stupid scammers and all that who

7433.679 --> 7440.4400000000005
actually didn't at least like work

7437.32 --> 7442.28
together on a giant scale to get

7440.44 --> 7443.598999999999
millions of people killed through

7442.28 --> 7447.04
medical

7443.599 --> 7450.559
experimentation like he didn't do that

7447.04 --> 7450.559
so what's the urgency

7457.119 --> 7463.32
here he did at

7460.159 --> 7466.839999999999
Jabs fair enough lots of people did in

7463.32 --> 7469.4
the beginning lot lots of

7466.84 --> 7472.159000000001
them ever consider that maybe he

7469.4 --> 7475.92
actually did think it was

7472.159 --> 7475.92
genuine I think he did it

7476.8 --> 7483.52
himself is that

7478.92 --> 7486.2390000000005
still eugenic genocidal evil then if you

7483.52 --> 7487.92
believe in it yourself and you take it

7486.239 --> 7490.759999999999
and then you figure out afterward that

7487.92 --> 7490.76
it's horeshit

7493.28 --> 7499.84
yeah I know tered and I read it I read

7496.52 --> 7502.320000000001
Elon did Advocate the Jabs hope this

7499.84 --> 7505.559
message gets through first time it

7502.32 --> 7508.44
didn't yeah I read it that's why I

7505.559 --> 7511.4400000000005
responded to it

7508.44 --> 7511.44
tet

7512.83 --> 7517.26

7517.679 --> 7520.679
yeah

7521.12 --> 7524.479
[Music]

7527.8 --> 7532.88
did he Force anybody to take it did he

7530.88 --> 7536.1990000000005
Force

7532.88 --> 7539.8
anybody or did he just go with it and

7536.199 --> 7542.36
take it because he believed it was real

7539.8 --> 7545.04
cuz he's kind of a dumbass really in

7542.36 --> 7547.679
many ways he's not as smart as everybody

7545.04 --> 7550.04
says he is absolutely

7547.679 --> 7552.28
not

7550.04 --> 7555.76
medical experiment oh so that means that

7552.28 --> 7558.0
he is responsible yeah teret I mean of

7555.76 --> 7560.04
course there was a giant medical

7558.0 --> 7563.159
experiment it was everywhere it was

7560.04 --> 7567.079
getting pushed on everybody so since

7563.159 --> 7571.119
let's just say 30% of people worked

7567.079 --> 7573.799999999999
along with it in any sort of way were

7571.119 --> 7576.639
Pro it in any way does that mean that

9055.08 --> 9060.96
little kid I was always like I want a

9057.12 --> 9063.12
mini Ferrari I want a mini super car

9060.96 --> 9065.278999999999

9063.12 --> 9067.0
but and it like doesn't even go for it's

9065.279 --> 9070.24
just like I want it because in my mind

9067.0 --> 9073.72
it was like yeah now I can like Drive

9070.24 --> 9073.72
the Ferrari but as a

9073.75 --> 9077.76
[Music]

9075.359 --> 9080.479000000001
kid

9077.76 --> 9083.880000000001
I never got one of them I mean I did get

9080.479 --> 9086.56
a lot of Legos though as a kid and that

9083.88 --> 9087.98
was great still have it right away most

9086.56 --> 9092.389
of

9087.98 --> 9092.389
[Music]

9100.64 --> 9104.56
it yes Jose we

9104.68 --> 9111.56
know but you didn't really have a Daily

9107.319 --> 9114.8
Show now did you nor did you have real

9111.56 --> 9116.56
information to share you were just a

9114.8 --> 9118.319
place to hang around and I get it you

9116.56 --> 9121.0
were decent at

9118.319 --> 9123.88
it I'm also a place to hang around but

9121.0 --> 9127.439
I'm not just a place to hang

9123.88 --> 9133.0
around had a Daily Show I used to watch

9127.439 --> 9133.0
it really every day how long did that

9134.2 --> 9138.800000000001
last cuz I have an act ual Daily Show

9137.279 --> 9142.2
and I have

9138.8 --> 9146.72
1768 episodes to back that up so it's

9142.2 --> 9146.720000000001
actually daily not just daily in

9146.96 --> 9152.0
name right and when I don't show up a

9150.08 --> 9154.72
day like yesterday it's like this giant

9152.0 --> 9157.04
shock because I really am daily and

9154.72 --> 9158.278999999999
people really start to expect me to be

9157.04 --> 9161.399000000001
there

9158.279 --> 9164.399000000001
daily unlike Jose which as far as I

9161.399 --> 9164.399
remember was not

9165.24 --> 9171.119999999999
daily like not at all I mean it was

9168.84 --> 9171.12
there

9171.76 --> 9176.64
regularly but it wasn't there every day

9174.76 --> 9182.24
absolutely

9176.64 --> 9182.24
not maybe like the first half year or

9182.6 --> 9187.16
something I mean there was a lot more

9184.76 --> 9190.2
energy going

9187.16 --> 9191.84
around a lot more enthusiasm more people

9190.2 --> 9194.720000000001
getting drawn in and all

9191.84 --> 9197.52
that this is the only show that is daily

9194.72 --> 9201.479
yeah it is that's

9197.52 --> 9205.52
right it is the only Flat Earth show on

9201.479 --> 9208.199999999999
the internet that is actually every day

9205.52 --> 9211.16
now I don't actually talk about Flat

9208.2 --> 9214.52
Earth every single show but it is always

9211.16 --> 9216.8
an option though it can happen it can be

9214.52 --> 9218.439
brought to the table again and

9216.8 --> 9220.759999999998
especially if somebody new comes in and

9218.439 --> 9220.76
has a

9222.68 --> 9228.16
question

9225.16 --> 9228.16
right

9229.92 --> 9234.16
right but yeah despite that uh I still

9232.6 --> 9238.24
require

9234.16 --> 9240.96
support or I won't have any food

9238.24 --> 9245.039999999999
eventually yeah I put myself in that

9240.96 --> 9249.0
position and dude D zpp tappy [ __ ] off

9245.04 --> 9249.0

9277.22 --> 9280.4
[Music]

9285.08 --> 9288.08
tappy

9303.2 --> 9306.560000000001
what's wrong with him what's wrong with

9304.8 --> 9308.358999999999
him is that I kicked him out and then he

9306.56 --> 9310.96
comes back with his [ __ ] socker

9308.359 --> 9313.279
accounts which is absolutely not done

9310.96 --> 9315.0
here and guarantees that you will not be

9313.279 --> 9318.0
allowed

9315.0 --> 9318.0
back

9324.37 --> 9327.919000000002
[Music]

9335.439 --> 9344.960000000001
don't talk to him fiber oats number one

9341.439 --> 9347.960000000001
rule you don't talk to trolls that are

9344.96 --> 9347.96
banned

9348.05 --> 9353.539999999999
[Music]

9374.92 --> 9380.37
for

9377.3 --> 9380.369999999999
[Music]

9396.08 --> 9403.0
is this like a 5c holding

9399.8 --> 9405.358999999999
rule no no when somebody's actually

9403.0 --> 9406.8
kicked out I mean if they were just

9405.359 --> 9408.68
kicked out

9406.8 --> 9410.438999999998
cuz we had a conversation or something

9408.68 --> 9413.479000000001
that's one thing

9410.439 --> 9416.52
right but Zep tappy is not part of this

9413.479 --> 9419.599999999999
chat anymore he hasn't been for quite a

9416.52 --> 9422.12
while and if you then keep popping up

9419.6 --> 9423.92
after having been banned which is

9422.12 --> 9426.720000000001
already quite a stretch to get to that

9423.92 --> 9431.279
point if you then pop up with your sock

9426.72 --> 9431.278999999999
accounts yeah that just makes it all

9432.84 --> 9439.0
worse it makes it all worse and you're

9436.6 --> 9441.640000000001
not supposed to address them like if

9439.0 --> 9444.399
they come back that means that they're

9441.64 --> 9446.68
just refusing to take the hint if you

9444.399 --> 9449.0
then start talking to them then they

9446.68 --> 9451.92
refuse to take the hint even more and

9449.0 --> 9453.439
they will insist even more getting back

9451.92 --> 9455.319
because people talk to them like

9453.439 --> 9458.68
nothing's

9455.319 --> 9460.08
happening yeah that's a problem so once

9458.68 --> 9462.56
somebody gets

9460.08 --> 9467.8
banned and they reappear with socker

9462.56 --> 9467.8
account you don't address them ever

9472.359 --> 9476.399000000001
that's right they're to be

9486.2 --> 9491.240000000002
ignored that's right not putting fuel in

9488.399 --> 9494.319
them because they will just like use it

9491.24 --> 9496.72
to undermine right somebody else doesn't

9494.319 --> 9500.439
realize the impact of the situation

9496.72 --> 9504.319
that's happened they will use that

9500.439 --> 9507.279
moment as a momentum to undermine the

9504.319 --> 9508.96
authority even more that's what they do

9507.279 --> 9512.279
and that's why you shouldn't address

9508.96 --> 9514.96
them ever once they start reappearing

9512.279 --> 9517.720000000001
after they've been banned ever never

9514.96 --> 9519.96
talk to them ever don't ever do that

9517.72 --> 9519.96

with those [ __ ] [ __ ] wits i' I'd love

9636.52 --> 9643.560000000001
to be the person to get them out of this

9641.12 --> 9647.52
reality specifically that people it's

9643.56 --> 9647.519999999999
like cleaning up the trash

9650.319 --> 9655.0
if it were up to me I'd I'd literally

9652.52 --> 9656.04
make that sort of behavior illegal like

9655.0 --> 9659.72
I'd

9656.04 --> 9661.52
be very harsh with the punishment when

9659.72 --> 9664.679999999998
it comes to cyber

9661.52 --> 9666.359
stalking and overall trolling Behavior

9664.68 --> 9668.319
that's unwanted I mean if somebody wants

9666.359 --> 9670.800000000001
to troll around that's one

9668.319 --> 9672.88
thing right there's people like that

9670.8 --> 9677.16
Jose likes loves having trolls around

9672.88 --> 9681.24
him he just loves it I don't

9677.16 --> 9683.64
and as soon as somebody's like blatantly

9681.24 --> 9685.96
obvious about not wanting those ass

9683.64 --> 9689.88
wipes around if they then keep getting

9685.96 --> 9693.24
in your face then they should be legally

9689.88 --> 9693.24
punished very

9698.72 --> 9705.438999999998
harshly yeah first off having their

9701.319 --> 9707.96
complete identity publicly exposed yeah

9705.439 --> 9711.960000000001
oh [ __ ] troll yeah yeah yeah complete

9707.96 --> 9714.278999999999
identity publicly exposed including a

9711.96 --> 9718.358999999999
literal mug

9714.279 --> 9723.880000000001
shot and everything like full

9718.359 --> 9726.640000000001
doxing yeah you're a troll you you

9723.88 --> 9729.56
persist then you get a full public

9726.64 --> 9733.24
doxing like everybody in the world now

9729.56 --> 9735.84
knows your personal identity and that

9733.24 --> 9738.24
you are a [ __ ] troll yeah good luck

9735.84 --> 9738.24
with your

9742.4 --> 9748.119999999999
[Music]

9745.2 --> 9751.439
life that would be my

9748.12 --> 9753.960000000001
solution but it would be enforced by law

9751.439 --> 9755.359
not just other people that are exposing

9753.96 --> 9760.479
these people which is really cool when

9755.359 --> 9760.479000000001
they do that no just a lawful

9760.68 --> 9766.800000000001
reinforcement but how that's very

9764.359 --> 9768.640000000001
easy

9766.8 --> 9771.358999999999
you think you can't track those people

9768.64 --> 9773.8
doing that you know how [ __ ] easy it

9771.359 --> 9778.359
is to track people doing that you think

9773.8 --> 9781.8
that VPN really Shields you

9778.359 --> 9783.52
no no it doesn't I me it might Shield

9781.8 --> 9787.0
you from

9783.52 --> 9789.960000000001
like like

9787.0 --> 9792.8
algorithmic uh what do you call that Alo

9789.96 --> 9794.839999999998
algorithmic Lanes right that literally

9792.8 --> 9797.96
like oh get the metadata oh they put you

9794.84 --> 9799.64
in a lane for things right yeah VPN will

9797.96 --> 9803.759999999998
definitely help against that sort of

9799.64 --> 9807.92
[ __ ] like for superficial tracing uh if

9803.76 --> 9811.439
the police or like National Security

9807.92 --> 9815.72
Secret Service if they want to trace you

9811.439 --> 9816.84
they trace you click it's like [ __ ] VPN

9815.72 --> 9820.55
it's

9816.84 --> 9823.62
[ __ ] it doesn't actually make you

9820.55 --> 9823.619999999999
[Music]

9824.279 --> 9827.279
anonymous

9842.72 --> 9850.84
yeah it doesn't actually make you

9846.399 --> 9853.599999999999
Anonymous it helps somewhat it'll bypass

9850.84 --> 9855.76
firewall Securities that are Regional

9853.6 --> 9858.880000000001
based all that sort of stuff yeah it

9855.76 --> 9863.0
help a bit but if secret surfice wants

9858.88 --> 9864.759999999998
to get you he will really really get you

9863.0 --> 9867.64
and there's absolutely nothing you can

9864.76 --> 9872.52
do with your stupid little VPN to stop

9867.64 --> 9877.358999999999
that yeah you can't actually be

9872.52 --> 9877.359
anonymous when it comes to like legal

9878.22 --> 9882.24
[Music]

9880.0 --> 9885.56

9952.96 --> 9961.519999999999
shared vast vast detail about my

9957.8 --> 9963.24
personal life that most people can't

9961.52 --> 9965.92
even

9963.24 --> 9968.52
grasp about themselves in order to

9965.92 --> 9971.8
communicate it privately to their own

9968.52 --> 9974.279
family members yeah yeah that's how much

9971.8 --> 9978.119999999999
I've openly shared about my internal

9974.279 --> 9985.0
World on the internet yeah troll

9978.12 --> 9987.960000000001
troll no no fully exposed and open yeah

9985.0 --> 9990.52
what am I hiding if you can find

9987.96 --> 9993.64
anything about me and my life that I'm

9990.52 --> 9996.52
hiding I'd like to know about it cuz I

9993.64 --> 10000.68
don't think you will because I'm living

9996.52 --> 10003.12
my life like literally there's a

10000.68 --> 10005.64
fourth-dimensional camera following me

10003.12 --> 10009.399000000001
around at all times in every everything

10005.64 --> 10012.519999999999
I do and think is being recorded and

10009.399 --> 10017.039999999999
analyzed yeah that's how I live my life

10012.52 --> 10017.04
for like the last 20 years

10017.24 --> 10023.439
yeah everything people got on me is just

10020.359 --> 10026.800000000001
a bunch of self imagined horse

10023.439 --> 10029.16
crap because they don't pick the things

10026.8 --> 10030.84
that I talk about they don't ask the

10029.16 --> 10033.56
about the things that I talk about they

10030.84 --> 10037.0
don't know anything about me they're

10033.56 --> 10039.64
just compl completely baffled about a

10037.0 --> 10042.24
guy that's so [ __ ] honest about

10039.64 --> 10044.599999999999
almost everything even the things that

10042.24 --> 10047.56
would like humiliate people through the

10044.6 --> 10049.359
point of suicide and I just [ __ ]

10047.56 --> 10052.199999999999
share it

10049.359 --> 10054.68
openly I don't

10052.2 --> 10058.960000000001
care I'm not

10054.68 --> 10063.2
afraid I'm not afraid I'm not afraid I

10058.96 --> 10066.24
don't have fear I am open and honest and

10063.2 --> 10069.640000000001
all my weaknesses will all be exposed

10066.24 --> 10072.52
you know why because that way I'm forced

10069.64 --> 10075.76
to face them and work on

10072.52 --> 10078.6
them if I didn't tell everybody about

10075.76 --> 10081.800000000001
them then I can keep it a secret and

10078.6 --> 10084.960000000001
even pretend it doesn't exist but if I

10081.8 --> 10088.72
just openly and honestly share all these

10084.96 --> 10092.399
things now that makes it officially

10088.72 --> 10096.8
known and now if I don't do anything

10092.399 --> 10098.96
about it I'm just the guy with a problem

10096.8 --> 10101.16
that can't overcome the problem which

10098.96 --> 10104.399
would turn me into a

10101.16 --> 10107.08
weakling so by exposing everything that

10104.399 --> 10113.519999999999
I say and think honestly and openly to

10107.08 --> 10119.24
the world I force myself to work on

10113.52 --> 10122.2
myself without any option to not do that

10119.24 --> 10125.52
that doesn't lead to complete

10122.2 --> 10127.0
ruin yeah that's what I'm doing and

10125.52 --> 10130.08
that's why there's a whole bunch of

10127.0 --> 10133.52
people that are just like I there I'm

10130.08 --> 10136.2
way too titillating to their imagination

10133.52 --> 10140.479000000001
I literally drive them insane because

10136.2 --> 10144.12
they cannot even remotely grasp that a

10140.479 --> 10147.119999999999
person could actually do and live the

10144.12 --> 10150.160000000002
way that I do things and the way that I

10147.12 --> 10153.720000000001
live they can't imagine that a person

10150.16 --> 10157.92
can actually decide to do

10153.72 --> 10157.92
that yet here I

10158.0 --> 10164.239
am so they have to imagine like I'm a

10161.52 --> 10165.92
troll they have to imagine like I'm all

10164.239 --> 10168.439
these other things which they have

10165.92 --> 10171.279
absolutely no proof for that I am or

10168.439 --> 10173.800000000001
even a trace of evidence for

10171.279 --> 10176.399000000001
it

10173.8 --> 10178.119999999999
yeah I mean I'm still waiting like hey

10176.399 --> 10182.039999999999
could somebody

10178.12 --> 10185.160000000002
please like do some deep search about my

10182.04 --> 10189.6
past like especially in between between

10185.16 --> 10192.319
97 and 2003 I would really like to know

10189.6 --> 10195.399000000001
what the [ __ ] happened then because

10192.319 --> 10198.6
there's entire black spots where I

10195.399 --> 10200.96
literally can't really place together

10198.6 --> 10200.960000000001
what

10201.76 --> 10206.279
happened and I got a suspicion that I

10204.359 --> 10210.279
might have done something really [ __ ]

10206.279 --> 10213.640000000001
up even I can't prove it

10210.279 --> 10215.359
though and I'm really weirded out by

10213.64 --> 10219.56
that

10215.359 --> 10220.720000000001
but nobody's ever like police Secret

10219.56 --> 10223.88
Service

10220.72 --> 10226.599999999999
whatever even my healer says like no

10223.88 --> 10229.519999999999
nothing happened now why the

10226.6 --> 10231.720000000001
[ __ ] does it seem like so much happened

10229.52 --> 10231.720000000001
to

10232.479 --> 10239.0
me and dark things so much dark things

10236.04 --> 10240.880000000001
like what the [ __ ] was going on why do I

10239.0 --> 10244.319
think that I've done all these things

10240.88 --> 10246.64
when I can't prove it it's really freaky

10244.319 --> 10246.64
to me

10248.04 --> 10255.0
but now there's no investigator there's

10251.88 --> 10258.56
no private investigator police off

10255.0 --> 10260.08
nobody nobody's coming like hey this is

10258.56 --> 10263.039999999999
what's happened this is what you

10260.08 --> 10264.84
actually did and this is how it all got

10263.04 --> 10267.52
muffled under the carpet or something

10264.84 --> 10271.12
nothing I don't [ __ ] know what

10267.52 --> 10271.12
happened I don't

10271.76 --> 10276.56
know I just know what [ __ ] ser

10287.0 --> 10293.239
are we the murrian

10289.2 --> 10295.16
candidate I I'm not entirely sure about

10293.239 --> 10298.96
the context of that

10295.16 --> 10302.56
word I don't know man but I was in a

10298.96 --> 10306.0
sort of way not the literal version but

10302.56 --> 10309.84
I was sort of involved in an MK Ultra

10306.0 --> 10313.96
thing or at least the guy the Jesuit guy

10309.84 --> 10316.92
did that like he had knowledge of how to

10313.96 --> 10319.119999999999
do that he had the equipment he had the

10316.92 --> 10323.68
drugs how to do

10319.12 --> 10325.92
it and he sort of preliminary did it

10323.68 --> 10328.08
with me he even offered me like we can

10325.92 --> 10330.960000000001
take this further I

10328.08 --> 10333.52
like

10330.96 --> 10336.519999999999
no and then he sort of tried to

10333.52 --> 10338.0
manipulate me to make me go further and

10336.52 --> 10340.960000000001
I didn't

10338.0 --> 10342.76
bite because I was already freaking

10340.96 --> 10346.919999999998
entering the Dark World having an

10342.76 --> 10349.479
80-year Vision parallel to my own life

10346.92 --> 10352.68
and like meeting weird freaking demonic

10349.479 --> 10355.72
figures and getting an inside on like

10352.68 --> 10357.800000000001
the freaking plan of the world and like

10355.72 --> 10363.119999999999
Wars that are going to roll out in the

10357.8 --> 10365.358999999999
future yeah I saw that [ __ ] like around

10363.12 --> 10368.359
between 97 20

10365.359 --> 10371.56
3 like I saw the things about freaking

10368.359 --> 10374.2
Israel now I saw things about Iran I saw

10371.56 --> 10377.08
things about North Korea I saw the

10374.2 --> 10382.84
weirdest [ __ ] imaginable things I saw

10377.08 --> 10384.56
a gigantic 100 mile endless black crater

10382.84 --> 10387.72
where there was no

10384.56 --> 10392.039999999999
Horizon okay it wasn't there anymore I

10387.72 --> 10395.479
saw that I saw freaking futuristic

10392.04 --> 10397.160000000002
situations where soldiers and in this

10395.479 --> 10399.239
I'm just going to say it's soldiers from

10397.16 --> 10401.119999999999
China it makes no [ __ ] sense to me

10399.239 --> 10403.08
logically I feel really embarrassed for

10401.12 --> 10406.6
bringing it up but they [ __ ]

10403.08 --> 10409.64
teleported into locations

10406.6 --> 10412.279
yeah I don't it must have been a [ __ ]

10409.64 --> 10414.84
movie because like what the hell what

10412.279 --> 10418.399000000001
the [ __ ] hell I got to see all these

10414.84 --> 10421.76
things so [ __ ] much 80 years worth of

10418.399 --> 10423.8
data and like up close and like being

10421.76 --> 10427.16
with people that are prominent and like

10423.8 --> 10427.16
what the [ __ ] is

10433.76 --> 10441.12
that and why did it last so incredibly

10438.12 --> 10443.479000000001
long why did I think I was going to die

10441.12 --> 10443.479000000001
when it

10444.239 --> 10449.92
ended why was there freaking torture

10453.279 --> 10456.279
[ __ ]

10460.439 --> 10466.319
so you remember no this is Dark World

10463.6 --> 10468.359
[ __ ] I just remember the Dark World I

10466.319 --> 10470.84
don't remember what actually happened in

10468.359 --> 10473.6
my life I I wonder if anything actually

10470.84 --> 10476.12
happened in my life but the Dark World

10473.6 --> 10478.16
it just never [ __ ] stopped it was 80

10476.12 --> 10481.479000000001
years compacted of like the most

10478.16 --> 10483.8
elaborate [ __ ] information it's a

10481.479 --> 10486.76
lifetime worth of information you all

10483.8 --> 10489.759999999998
get in 80 years compacted in that

10486.76 --> 10491.479
literally like one minute in the real

10489.76 --> 10494.800000000001
world it's

10491.479 --> 10498.239
crazy it's [ __ ] insane

10494.8 --> 10502.08
and and I'm still dealing with it now

10498.239 --> 10505.439
still now today still unpacking trying

10502.08 --> 10507.479
to unpack some of this Dark World [ __ ]

10505.439 --> 10511.960000000001
that has happened back then I'm still

10507.479 --> 10511.96
talking about it regularly on my

10513.2 --> 10516.2
show

10517.96 --> 10523.278999999999
and some things I really know

10520.2 --> 10527.08
specifically like for some reason I

10523.279 --> 10527.08
looked out of Dennis Rodman's

10527.76 --> 10535.52
eyes when he met Kim yungun like why the

10532.239 --> 10539.439
[ __ ] did I get to see that why the hell

10535.52 --> 10541.76
did I how how did I see through his eyes

10539.439 --> 10543.800000000001
how and how did I find out he is

10541.76 --> 10545.52
colorblind because I looked through his

10543.8 --> 10548.08
eyes I didn't even know who the [ __ ] he

10545.52 --> 10550.0
was but apparently he's colorblind I got

10548.08 --> 10555.96
to see through his eyes so I know what

10550.0 --> 10555.96
that's like yeah like what the

10557.08 --> 10565.359
[ __ ] and that's just one specific

10560.04 --> 10565.359
example it's weird it's really [ __ ]

10565.76 --> 10570.960000000001
weird what year were the Dark World

10568.319 --> 10573.119999999999
experience it started in 97 that's what

10570.96 --> 10576.119999999999
really broke it

10573.12 --> 10576.12
open

10576.52 --> 10584.399000000001
and it pretty much just went on it up

10580.72 --> 10584.399
until 2003 and

10585.88 --> 10589.519999999999
then I sort of

10590.479 --> 10595.119999999999
fled I

10592.2 --> 10596.560000000001
realized like the full nature of some of

10595.12 --> 10599.239000000001
this

10596.56 --> 10602.64
Satanism and I was just I

10599.239 --> 10605.16
fled I I just went completely I I

10602.64 --> 10607.278999999999
started to wake up to Al jonesa it's

10605.16 --> 10610.8
like the flip moment where I started to

10607.279 --> 10613.12
realize like wait maybe Satanism is just

10610.8 --> 10615.64
actually really [ __ ] evil and it's

10613.12 --> 10618.2
all so delusional that it doesn't even

10615.64 --> 10621.358999999999
realize it's really evil and it plays

10618.2 --> 10623.6
Evil like a game it's just evil is like

10621.359 --> 10625.92
trendy like they don't even understand

10623.6 --> 10629.479000000001
what evil is anymore it's so [ __ ]

10625.92 --> 10633.08
insane and I sort of rolled into

10629.479 --> 10634.96
that starting in my teens finding some

10633.08 --> 10637.72
of these people being really interested

10634.96 --> 10639.88
being really interested in occult stuff

10637.72 --> 10641.358999999999
and thinking like wait no the world is

10639.88 --> 10643.92
turned inside

10641.359 --> 10646.720000000001
out look at this all this corrupted

10643.92 --> 10648.84
Christianity it is actually evil they do

10646.72 --> 10651.479
really evil manipulative things while

10648.84 --> 10654.0
all these satanists they're just being

10651.479 --> 10658.358999999999
honest and that's how I started to see

10654.0 --> 10661.16
things then and I grew into it sort of

10658.359 --> 10664.2
and then eventually I found out that no

10661.16 --> 10667.6
wait it just never stops flipping it

10664.2 --> 10669.880000000001
never stops flip-flopping it's all a lie

10667.6 --> 10671.960000000001
everything about Satanism is a lie and

10669.88 --> 10674.199999999999
the people in it don't even realize it

10671.96 --> 10675.72
anymore eventually it's all just

10674.2 --> 10677.68
complete

10675.72 --> 10680.76
derangement it's all complete

10677.68 --> 10682.800000000001
derangement and they don't know that it

10680.76 --> 10684.800000000001
is complete

10682.8 --> 10687.64
derangement if they knew it they

10684.8 --> 10687.64
wouldn't be in

10688.04 --> 10694.560000000001
it well when I realized for it for what

10691.08 --> 10697.56
it was really when I lost my doubts

10694.56 --> 10700.439
about it that's when I slipped out I

10697.56 --> 10703.72
basically took off the glove and just

10700.439 --> 10706.0
like I'm just going to heal now for 10

10703.72 --> 10708.599999999999
years because I was so [ __ ]

10706.0 --> 10710.08
spiritually wounded from all of it and I

10708.6 --> 10712.92
thought it was going to amount to

10710.08 --> 10716.52
something great to a completion of some

10712.92 --> 10719.08
kind and it didn't instead it was all

10716.52 --> 10722.52
just gradually getting more connected to

10719.08 --> 10724.72
me to try to suck me vampiric dry and

10722.52 --> 10726.319000000001
leave nothing behind so that I would

10724.72 --> 10728.76
just kill myself because there was

10726.319 --> 10731.88
nothing left of me that's what I was

10728.76 --> 10733.319
going to try to do and I spotted that

10731.88 --> 10737.479
and I

10733.319 --> 10741.68
retracted and I started to say uh

10737.479 --> 10744.92
nope like no I don't accept I started to

10741.68 --> 10747.12
learn how to withstand peer pressure

10744.92 --> 10749.84
better it's always been a problem but

10747.12 --> 10752.92
much better and I became like more like

10749.84 --> 10754.880000000001
a truther and Alex Jones came around in

10752.92 --> 10758.239
my scope and then and I realized like

10754.88 --> 10761.119999999999
yeah this is how you put the break on

10758.239 --> 10764.239
it's all [ __ ] like it was like the

10761.12 --> 10768.12
first hook on that could make me hold on

10764.239 --> 10770.56
to the insight and the accepting that

10768.12 --> 10773.0
there is absolute evil out there and

10770.56 --> 10775.479
it's actually in control and nobody can

10773.0 --> 10779.84
handle it it was the first time I

10775.479 --> 10781.239
started being capable of seeing that

10779.84 --> 10784.2
capable of

10781.239 --> 10785.96
seeing that it's all being gas lit

10784.2 --> 10788.76
because people can't handle that evil

10785.96 --> 10791.0
exists to that level that was all

10788.76 --> 10794.6
running on I was finally starting to see

10791.0 --> 10797.12
that for real and see that I'm not a

10794.6 --> 10799.960000000001
part of that evil because I can't

10797.12 --> 10801.960000000001
physically handle evil I don't have the

10799.96 --> 10805.278999999999
stomach for it

10801.96 --> 10808.358999999999
I like I go

10805.279 --> 10812.880000000001
unstable I get really unstable from

10808.359 --> 10816.279
actual evil I can't be it I tried I

10812.88 --> 10819.239
can't do it it's physically incap I'm

10816.279 --> 10822.439
physically incapable of doing

10819.239 --> 10825.319
that like there are mechanisms in my

10822.439 --> 10828.68
deepest spiritual roots that literally

10825.319 --> 10830.84
come forth and like like no you're not

10828.68 --> 10833.56
going to be pulled to that evil you're

10830.84 --> 10838.239
not going to let go of The Godly

10833.56 --> 10841.64
instincts you will not do that like I

10838.239 --> 10844.8
will destroy your entire life from

10841.64 --> 10846.519999999999
whatever perspective to prevent that

10844.8 --> 10849.479
from happening and that's what happened

10846.52 --> 10853.08
with me I couldn't do it I was

10849.479 --> 10855.239
physically incapable of embracing evil

10853.08 --> 10858.12
from an ignorant perspective I couldn't

10855.239 --> 10860.039999999999
do it I couldn't trick myself into not

10858.12 --> 10862.479000000001
understanding it so I would take it I

10860.04 --> 10864.76
couldn't do it it was physically

10862.479 --> 10868.399
impossible I

10864.76 --> 10871.04
couldn't I couldn't without deciding if

10868.399 --> 10874.239
you embraced it then you choose to die

10871.04 --> 10877.52
very quickly I couldn't trick my myself

10874.239 --> 10879.68
I was incapable of tricking myself I

10877.52 --> 10883.04
couldn't do it I couldn't stop my Divine

10879.68 --> 10886.2
instincts I couldn't stop

10883.04 --> 10889.560000000001
God from preventing me from doing that I

10886.2 --> 10892.04
couldn't stop it and I'm so glad that I

10889.56 --> 10894.6
have those strong instincts from God

10892.04 --> 10897.439
within my design that made it incapable

10894.6 --> 10900.279
for me to decide that because now I

10897.439 --> 10903.16
still have all that power that was going

10900.279 --> 10906.720000000001
to go away forever if I had actually

10903.16 --> 10906.72
been a able to do

10911.12 --> 10918.640000000001
that I was very much tested by evil I

10915.68 --> 10922.880000000001
was right there on the verge of becoming

10918.64 --> 10925.599999999999
really [ __ ] dark but I was physically

10922.88 --> 10928.679999999998
incapable of following through on

10925.6 --> 10930.68
it even though I thought that I was

10928.68 --> 10932.76
actually doing the right thing in ways

10930.68 --> 10934.84
because the world was entirely inside

10932.76 --> 10936.960000000001
out it was already proven to me yeah it

10934.84 --> 10941.08
is [ __ ] inside everything is inside

10936.96 --> 10944.679999999998
out so maybe good is evil then and maybe

10941.08 --> 10946.92
evil is good I really thought that and I

10944.68 --> 10950.68
could argue it that's the craziest thing

10946.92 --> 10950.68
I could actually argue it

10955.439 --> 10960.359
logically and I'm

10957.64 --> 10963.319
out and

10960.359 --> 10965.6
then and then it just took a long time

10963.319 --> 10968.8
it it just took a very long time to like

10965.6 --> 10972.319
restore realize like yeah what I was

10968.8 --> 10977.08
going to do could have never worked it

10972.319 --> 10977.08
was irrational it was all just like

10980.9 --> 10983.94
[Music]

10991.16 --> 10995.2
unbasic by the darkness and it was

10993.52 --> 10997.2
preparing myself to go there but I

10995.2 --> 10998.880000000001
didn't go there and now I had lost

10997.2 --> 11002.68
everything I had lost all these opport I

10998.88 --> 11005.56
have a held back yes I'm I'm a genius

11002.68 --> 11008.08
guy I'm so smart I'm so Dynamic I'm so

11005.56 --> 11011.64
good with communication but my entire

11008.08 --> 11014.6
life is [ __ ] up I don't have a job

11011.64 --> 11018.56
career I don't have

11014.6 --> 11021.640000000001
a a background if I would get a job I

11018.56 --> 11025.359
get a shitty job because I have no

11021.64 --> 11028.399
record it's all because of that I should

11025.359 --> 11031.319
have not gone along with the seduction

11028.399 --> 11033.479
at all and really maniacally focused on

11031.319 --> 11036.479
getting a career but I didn't because I

11033.479 --> 11039.479
was too [ __ ] weak and my parents were

11036.479 --> 11042.599999999999
weak too everything was weak around

11039.479 --> 11044.88
me and so I felt like I am in a lost

11042.6 --> 11047.12
situation I will never be able to get a

11044.88 --> 11049.56
normal life it's just going to be tortur

11047.12 --> 11052.439
until I die from collapsing under the

11049.56 --> 11054.76
weight of it so I thought like well

11052.439 --> 11057.960000000001
maybe I can complete bypass it step out

11054.76 --> 11059.84
of it and get to the ruling class which

11057.96 --> 11062.16
I can then reform and and actually

11059.84 --> 11063.84
stabilize make it better but it didn't

11062.16 --> 11065.64
work because I couldn't physically

11063.84 --> 11067.52
choose it because when I was going to

11065.64 --> 11071.358999999999
choose it I didn't realize yet what it

11067.52 --> 11074.239
all was and I was being tricked to what

11071.359 --> 11078.16
degree but I still despite not having

11074.239 --> 11081.96
the conscious to to get a grasp on that

11078.16 --> 11086.88
my instincts still prevented me from

11081.96 --> 11089.64
doing it they broke me it made me weak

11086.88 --> 11092.56
on purpose it made me weak in

11089.64 --> 11094.239
humiliating ways to lose respect from

11092.56 --> 11097.039999999999
these people that were trying to pull me

11094.239 --> 11099.84
in when all I wanted to be was strong

11097.04 --> 11102.720000000001
for them so that they would respect me

11099.84 --> 11102.72
well it did the

11102.84 --> 11107.359
opposite it made me weaker and weaker as

11105.6 --> 11110.84
more time

11107.359 --> 11116.359
passed and because of that I was

11110.84 --> 11116.359
incapable of really transforming to Pure

11116.56 --> 11122.08
Evil it made

11118.92 --> 11124.72
me like realize like yeah well if I just

11122.08 --> 11127.64
go for the attempt I will just die I

11124.72 --> 11130.92
will just feel torch it

11127.64 --> 11132.72
forever until I decide to end it like it

11130.92 --> 11135.04
was like yeah well that's not

11132.72 --> 11138.399
accomplishing anything there's not much

11135.04 --> 11141.279
of a tradeoff so there's literally no

11138.399 --> 11142.278999999999
logical purpose for me to to transition

11141.279 --> 11145.279
to

11142.279 --> 11148.0
evil unless it was to kill myself and

11145.279 --> 11149.52
doom my soul forever it's like what the

11148.0 --> 11151.96
[ __ ] is the point of that there is no

11149.52 --> 11154.239
point of that that's already evil so

11151.96 --> 11157.039999999999
only evil could drive me to destroy

11154.239 --> 11160.56
myself without any purpose but I wasn't

11157.04 --> 11163.76
evil so I could never decide that so it

11160.56 --> 11167.64
was literally I was incapable by fate

11163.76 --> 11169.439
and by my inner instincts to to decide

11167.64 --> 11172.76
that I

11169.439 --> 11173.880000000001
tried with a lack of knowledge I was

11172.76 --> 11178.960000000001
capable

11173.88 --> 11178.96
of trying but I couldn't do

11179.84 --> 11185.359
it I didn't have it in me and I'm really

11183.12 --> 11188.960000000001
I feel really

11185.359 --> 11192.52
lucky that I didn't have it in me that

11188.96 --> 11196.199999999999
I'm not now one of those [ __ ]

11192.52 --> 11198.2
scumbags on TV telling you one thing and

11196.2 --> 11199.800000000001
then doing the other cuz that is

11198.2 --> 11202.2
probably what I would have become and I

11199.8 --> 11203.96
would have become pretty good at it

11202.2 --> 11206.92
too

11203.96 --> 11210.0
if I had been capable of doing that

11206.92 --> 11210.0
which it turns out I

11210.52 --> 11216.76
wasn't I'm just glad that I'm not

11213.12 --> 11220.399000000001
contributing to that overt

11216.76 --> 11223.08
evil which would have happened if I had

11220.399 --> 11223.08
gone through with

11224.12 --> 11230.160000000002
it right anyway everybody's just

11227.399 --> 11230.16
shutting up

11231.92 --> 11237.92
now right we old really

11235.12 --> 11240.560000000001
fascinated by my moment where I was like

11237.92 --> 11244.439
trying to put on the ring of power like

11240.56 --> 11244.439
I'm I'm going to put it

11245.08 --> 11252.319
on I can't do it that's pretty much what

11249.319 --> 11254.6
metaphorically was like with me I tried

11252.319 --> 11257.479
to put it on I couldn't do it it's like

11254.6 --> 11259.12
I'm not allowed to do it I couldn't

11257.479 --> 11261.358999999999
understand consciously but

11259.12 --> 11262.12
subconsciously like I wasn't allowed to

11261.359 --> 11265.12
do

11262.12 --> 11265.12
it

11268.0 --> 11272.56
all right anyway I think I'm going to

11269.319 --> 11276.519999999999
round out the show been going over 3

11272.56 --> 11278.08
hours I really really think that I

11276.52 --> 11279.720000000001
deserve a

11278.08 --> 11282.96
PayPal

11279.72 --> 11284.84
for having been incapable of turning to

11282.96 --> 11288.08
the dark side when I had the chance

11284.84 --> 11290.72
those decades ago you can all thank me

11288.08 --> 11295.039999999999
