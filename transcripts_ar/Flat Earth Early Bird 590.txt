32.05 --> 34.11
you

37.21 --> 44.36
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

41.27 --> 45.980000000000004
early-bird number 590 I'm your host

44.36 --> 47.9
Arwen and before we start the show

45.98 --> 49.91
please don't forget to share it on any

47.9 --> 51.65
platform you deem fit and if you haven't

membership system joined button that

64.16 --> 70.34
will be much appreciated thank you for

68.06 --> 77.45
all who have supported me over at the

70.34 --> 80.18
Times alright today the weather is yeah

77.45 --> 87.289
I don't know it's it's mostly just

80.18 --> 89.21000000000001
really windy constantly and I don't know

87.289 --> 94.31
you might even be able to see some of

89.21 --> 98.72
the clouds moving yeah see that compared

94.31 --> 103.849
to the tree it's definitely moving

98.72 --> 106.67
anyway yeah there's big clouds with rain

103.849 --> 108.56
in them and yeah there's a nice clear

106.67 --> 111.56
patch that just came over us but it's

108.56 --> 113.78
it's over now so yeah if it's gonna

111.56 --> 116.149
start raining I'm gonna rush out in the

113.78 --> 118.13
middle of the show to get my socks

116.149 --> 119.869
because I don't don't want them to get

118.13 --> 126.289
all wet again

119.869 --> 127.539
just so you know alright actually have

126.289 --> 132.5
to do that right now

127.539 --> 134.95
because looks like it's about to be a

132.5 --> 134.95
bucket

164.94 --> 171.07999999999998
Wow I wasn't a second too soon doesn't

168.0 --> 171.08
training right cut off

199.26 --> 202.37
just in time

204.41 --> 216.68
it's literally like like I said I knew

209.58 --> 216.68
what was coming and there it is so yeah

218.69 --> 236.28
see that but it's raining pretty hard so

224.97 --> 239.73
yeah I called it so I got to wear a

236.28 --> 249.84
coffee with me today and green tea as

239.73 --> 255.29999999999998
usual let's use in chat right so reserve

249.84 --> 262.38
lilyc his first Missouri bear Tom Parker

255.3 --> 273.6
Amanda you good servant / McCool Robin

262.38 --> 280.64
Stanley dank to see you eyes wide shut

273.6 --> 285.27000000000004
Oh J right I think I got you all

280.64 --> 287.37
yeah is everybody now mr. Infeld ashabi

285.27 --> 289.65
still unblocked I think he's just sick

287.37 --> 290.3
of my show for now he probably took my

289.65 --> 296.78
advice

290.3 --> 302.88
cool down right so I went to bed

296.78 --> 307.96
extremely early yesterday as in I think

302.88 --> 312.90999999999997
11 o'clock or something it's crazy

307.96 --> 312.90999999999997
because I was I didn't know I needed it

313.75 --> 322.97
so yeah subsequently I was up very early

316.879 --> 327.319
today at half-past seven and I was like

322.97 --> 335.72
really up up and yeah awake done some

327.319 --> 337.28000000000003
stuff watch them videos are growing

335.72 --> 340.97
awesome well I'm glad the weather is

337.28 --> 343.34
turning around for you Missouri Bear it

340.97 --> 347.33000000000004
seems like we have now received your

343.34 --> 349.669
weather you had when it was so hot over

347.33 --> 352.06
here because now it's constantly raining

349.669 --> 352.06
here

361.999 --> 365.319
oh yeah sure

369.5 --> 376.76
all right I suggest an alternative

372.71 --> 379.19
hypothesis to that moving urban urbanely

376.76 --> 380.96
kissing yeah kissing gestated world work

379.19 --> 385.46
seven world order or world will burn

380.96 --> 388.27
well about this world will accept new

385.46 --> 391.75
world order or new world order will burn

388.27 --> 391.75
how about that

406.18 --> 411.97
you know the thing about hurried

409.06 --> 415.419
movements they tend to cause a lot of

411.97 --> 416.77000000000004
friction and if that increases and the

415.419 --> 421.35999999999996
friction becomes more and more

416.77 --> 428.85999999999996
yeah they heat arises you know and then

421.36 --> 430.78000000000003
yeah the thing will burn the thing that

428.86 --> 436.66
is being moved so quickly anyway it's

430.78 --> 440.10999999999996
just metaphorical I wouldn't I wouldn't

436.66 --> 442.99
even go there stop stop

440.11 --> 444.97
virtue signaling to God how little you

442.99 --> 449.759
care for the world and only want to be

444.97 --> 449.759
in heaven please I urge you

468.629 --> 477.19
all right because it's not helping

471.58 --> 478.96
others no just because your virtues

477.19 --> 480.699
signaling something that yeah could be

478.96 --> 482.10999999999996
considered good and not just the new

480.699 --> 483.849
world order or something [ __ ]

482.11 --> 493.93
doesn't mean that virtue signaling in

483.849 --> 499.199
general is good for anything right

493.93 --> 499.199
anyway sorry it's just that you know I

499.68 --> 505.06
have to be like that to you

502.3 --> 507.24
I hope you know I'm doing it for a good

505.06 --> 507.24
reason

512.729 --> 515.289
let's see what you guys are talking

514.87 --> 518.32
about

515.289 --> 524.47
oh yeah Missouri bear did you follow Big

518.32 --> 527.74
Bear yesterday I did that was pretty

524.47 --> 530.26
funny and he he was saying that he was

527.74 --> 534.64
going to unblock you so yeah yeah you

530.26 --> 537.31
were lucky and he said you were great by

534.64 --> 542.01
the way so I wasn't sure if he literally

537.31 --> 542.01
knew you but yeah good for you man

546.51 --> 554.06
and you're putting some pressure on your

549.33 --> 554.0600000000001
son to make kids hmm

554.51 --> 567.06
do you think he's ready for that like

562.53 --> 572.31
take that you do but anyway I'll stop

567.06 --> 572.79
butting out in your life right what was

572.31 --> 575.5799999999999
I doing

572.79 --> 578.37
uh yeah that was a good flat at the bed

575.58 --> 582.0600000000001
premiere yesterday I think it was the

578.37 --> 584.4
Friday show anybody see that I was

582.06 --> 588.7199999999999
pretty good in it I thought too but it

584.4 --> 592.4399999999999
was overall yeah it's funny in a way

588.72 --> 595.11
because you know we get the same set ups

592.44 --> 599.8100000000001
sort of like okay it's us under one

595.11 --> 602.46
among another and just talking about

599.81 --> 604.7299999999999
yeah the housekeeping questions and

602.46 --> 608.1600000000001
related things and presuppositions

604.73 --> 609.9
conceptualizations what I do or there's

608.16 --> 614.1
a baller coming in and then it's

609.9 --> 620.13
basically Nathan queuing them up until

614.1 --> 622.23
they yeah until they expire because yeah

620.13 --> 625.2
they don't really run away or concede

622.23 --> 627.36
ever seems to be very persistent pattern

625.2 --> 629.4000000000001
at it for no good reason mind you it's

627.36 --> 633.96
really weird that they just never

629.4 --> 638.31
concede but I'm just noticing that over

633.96 --> 641.25
the years now these distinct two types

638.31 --> 645.63
setups for the show are improving

641.25 --> 648.0
significantly like really well like

645.63 --> 650.88
we're getting more comfortable with one

648.0 --> 654.24
another and understanding better like

650.88 --> 658.65
how the show really works and yeah much

654.24 --> 662.4
more less elbow work there was a bit of

658.65 --> 664.74
elbowing at the beginning you know we

662.4 --> 668.49
were really trying to claim a solid

664.74 --> 672.12
place like people there was a lot of

668.49 --> 674.61
like flat earthers versus globus now

672.12 --> 679.889
it's like the flat earth debate really

674.61 --> 682.259
has become its own sup culture Platt

679.889 --> 684.989
concerning flat earths you could say it

682.259 --> 688.6990000000001
he's focused on science a lot and

684.989 --> 690.9590000000001
academics and it's just improved so much

688.699 --> 692.7589999999999
that yeah with that episode yesterday

690.959 --> 695.429
you could just really notice it it was

692.759 --> 700.019
really palpable you know we should at

695.429 --> 707.3389999999999
some point even just take comparable

700.019 --> 712.199
episodes of Flat Earth debates like 200

707.339 --> 715.499
episodes apart and then take cutted that

712.199 --> 717.209
cut it down so didn't know with the

715.499 --> 719.5790000000001
least filler as it were at least silence

717.209 --> 723.4799999999999
[ __ ] just to make it little bit concise

719.579 --> 725.4889999999999
whatever half-hour maybe and then put

723.48 --> 728.879
them after one another and compare it

725.489 --> 733.649
just compare how much more grip we now

728.879 --> 735.749
have how more certain we are like even I

733.649 --> 738.379
myself am a lot more certain about

735.749 --> 742.769
certain types of assertions about

738.379 --> 746.639
science for example and mechanics then I

742.769 --> 749.249
was like three years ago my technical

746.639 --> 751.739
knowledge has increased significantly

749.249 --> 754.35
just by exposure people explaining it

751.739 --> 758.97
and being able to ask questions and have

754.35 --> 760.86
direct answers you know sometimes even

758.97 --> 762.899
in school I didn't really have that

760.86 --> 765.749
opportunity I might have some specific

762.899 --> 768.54
type of question say something physics

765.749 --> 771.779
related but it would be not really the

768.54 --> 775.7389999999999
typical stuff in school I would ask

771.779 --> 777.629
about it and then yeah the if it's like

775.739 --> 779.279
really outside of the curriculum there

777.629 --> 782.189
was just a great chance they didn't know

779.279 --> 783.66
and like they could probably find out

782.189 --> 785.2489999999999
but they just didn't have the time in a

783.66 --> 786.689
room in their head to focus and they

785.249 --> 786.869
were like yes or it can help you with

786.689 --> 790.169
that

786.869 --> 792.289
no here it's different because we're

790.169 --> 795.569
talking with people that are really

792.289 --> 800.22
dedicating to just people learning on

795.569 --> 805.04
the spot in a way and it's I've gotten

800.22 --> 814.02
so much from this I've learned so much

805.04 --> 818.61
what I'm a physicist now this is I don't

814.02 --> 821.6999999999999
know about that but my knowledge in

818.61 --> 825.23
physics has increased dramatically it

821.7 --> 831.24
doesn't mean that I am a physicist oh

825.23 --> 832.74
I'm I'm a theoretical Cosmo genius

831.24 --> 834.66
that's really what I do and I can say

832.74 --> 838.17
that very easily because I leave it

834.66 --> 842.1899999999999
purely in the in the conceptual realm or

838.17 --> 844.86
well I basically forced to I could try

842.19 --> 847.59
to yeah figure out certain things and

844.86 --> 850.08
I've even proposed in how to do that

847.59 --> 852.51
many many times explain it over and over

850.08 --> 855.4200000000001
again first figure out the orientation

852.51 --> 856.98
of the equator and move yeah make

855.42 --> 859.8199999999999
decisions and figure it out from there

856.98 --> 862.0500000000001
on so I'm a theorist

859.82 --> 866.58
and as far as I know you don't really

862.05 --> 870.6899999999999
need any real cadre credentials you just

866.58 --> 873.69
need to say things that yeah that people

870.69 --> 880.59
can work with that make half way sense

873.69 --> 885.6600000000001
that are based on as much proven science

880.59 --> 887.61
and data things as possible and yeah try

885.66 --> 891.03
to figure it out so I can literally call

887.61 --> 894.24
myself a Cosmo genius a theoretical

891.03 --> 895.65
cosmologist and yeah I feel safe

894.24 --> 897.48
carrying that title I don't know if

895.65 --> 903.4399999999999
there's even anybody else out there in

897.48 --> 903.44
the world that calls themselves that so

905.06 --> 912.529
what's up servant

908.69 --> 917.48
Oh what is virtuous a come on you know

912.529 --> 918.35
what virtuous signaling is right you're

917.48 --> 921.769
just tired

918.35 --> 923.389
ah yeah well I called it virtuous signal

921.769 --> 925.639
I guess it's technically good server but

923.389 --> 928.1
it's not really for too sickening it's

925.639 --> 929.629
just it starts to sound like for it just

928.1 --> 931.48
sickening like every time there is

929.629 --> 934.61
something terrible going on or something

931.48 --> 936.41
about to have people say there is

934.61 --> 938.62
something a horrific going to happen or

936.41 --> 942.8
everybody's destroyed and you're just

938.62 --> 946.129
yeah I just love God I just love God I

942.8 --> 950.899
don't care like you don't have to do

946.129 --> 955.6990000000001
that you can just internalize that just

950.899 --> 957.74
know it but if you must express it then

955.699 --> 962.0
I think there's probably something wrong

957.74 --> 966.11
there in the sense that if you can't

962.0 --> 970.209
just know it in silence and you must

966.11 --> 972.0790000000001
express it then there's something not

970.209 --> 975.2299999999999
there's something out of place

972.079 --> 977.449
it's it may not be complete you may be

975.23 --> 982.899
trying to say it to reinforce it for

977.449 --> 982.899
yourself anyway sorry to get so personal

984.279 --> 988.759
but I just think it's better to

986.389 --> 990.73
internalize it because every time you do

988.759 --> 995.72
that it makes me really uncomfortable

990.73 --> 999.35
like I am NOT okay with the world going

995.72 --> 1001.269
to [ __ ] I know that I can't do a lot

999.35 --> 1003.1890000000001
about it but I'm not okay with it

1001.269 --> 1005.22
I'm not just gonna say I'm okay with

1003.189 --> 1005.2199999999999
that

1014.41 --> 1021.49
you know it's it's with individuals you

1019.389 --> 1025.419
know if individuals choose to go to hell

1021.49 --> 1027.73
and they will not be stopped then then I

1025.419 --> 1032.169
don't care about them I don't know

1027.73 --> 1035.559
that's because I can't because I was

1032.169 --> 1040.959
there and that's exactly what you need

1035.559 --> 1043.3899999999999
like I when I was there God just

1040.959 --> 1052.179
terribly even thinking back about it you

1043.39 --> 1054.4
you just hate and yeah I didn't

1052.179 --> 1058.179
appreciate even people feeling sorry for

1054.4 --> 1060.6100000000001
me I just needed help really to get out

1058.179 --> 1065.46
when I would even try nobody would be

1060.61 --> 1068.289
able to even they were just that away

1065.46 --> 1070.299
because they know like yeah I'm in this

1068.289 --> 1073.179
position because I can't handle this

1070.299 --> 1075.52
situation and I'm going insane and then

1073.179 --> 1078.7
when I tell that to people pretty raw

1075.52 --> 1081.94
straight up from an perspective where I

1078.7 --> 1085.3500000000001
didn't know you know I didn't really

1081.94 --> 1091.299
know what I got myself into yeah then

1085.35 --> 1094.1789999999999
yeah people tend to step away right so

1091.299 --> 1097.03
people that go into the darkness you

1094.179 --> 1100.0900000000001
basically have to let him and you should

1097.03 --> 1102.58
not feel bad unless they are like

1100.09 --> 1104.049
somebody you personally care about but

1102.58 --> 1106.1789999999999
because then they are taking that

1104.049 --> 1109.929
personal feeling connection you have

1106.179 --> 1113.049
into the darkness that's how I see it

1109.929 --> 1114.97
they're taking something of you your

1113.049 --> 1117.039
former friendship or your care you had

1114.97 --> 1120.429
into the darkness that's the thing that

1117.039 --> 1122.26
that should heart I don't know maybe

1120.429 --> 1127.299
this makes no sense to some people here

1122.26 --> 1134.1299999999999
maybe I'm just really been alone for too

1127.299 --> 1137.34
long but yeah the world itself you know

1134.13 --> 1142.7990000000002
it's like these people that go to hell

1137.34 --> 1142.799
we should defend the world against them

1144.13 --> 1153.0800000000002
isn't that basically the task of the

1147.35 --> 1156.1999999999998
caretaker isn't that what the design

1153.08 --> 1160.37
wants us to do to bring back the

1156.2 --> 1163.6000000000001
goodness in the world see so to say you

1160.37 --> 1163.6
don't care if burns

1172.89 --> 1180.0300000000002
all right

1174.9 --> 1186.27
anyway I'll stop I'll drop it I think

1180.03 --> 1188.67
you get the points I'm just being being

1186.27 --> 1190.29
difficult uh we are inspired by Christ

1188.67 --> 1192.5700000000002
and his amazing creation I don't want to

1190.29 --> 1195.96
see things fall apart into the darkness

1192.57 --> 1198.6
right right Robin Stanley well when a

1195.96 --> 1202.4
person goes there you can't really stop

1198.6 --> 1204.6299999999999
them if they know it if they realize it

1202.4 --> 1206.4
I'm not saying that if you see somebody

1204.63 --> 1208.5
tumble into the darkness you shouldn't

1206.4 --> 1211.1100000000001
try to warn them but once they're

1208.5 --> 1213.33
cleared up and they decide not to then

1211.11 --> 1215.09
it's it's really not your concern

1213.33 --> 1219.02
anymore

1215.09 --> 1219.02
their well-being that is

1225.16 --> 1232.75
all right well yeah glad glad of it

1228.96 --> 1245.6200000000001
laughs you good servant that Robert

1232.75 --> 1247.81
Stanley and the rest of ya Missouri bear

1245.62 --> 1252.9299999999998
you're a weirdo today if you mentioned

1247.81 --> 1252.9299999999998
God in public really you think so

1259.58 --> 1266.6899999999998
I don't know I don't know we're in

1263.33 --> 1270.53
public you've been but I think that in

1266.69 --> 1273.17
general it's perfectly fine you know if

1270.53 --> 1275.24
you're going to use God as an argument

1273.17 --> 1277.43
in some discussion yeah there's going to

1275.24 --> 1280.4
be people that absolutely dislike that

1277.43 --> 1280.88
and will become very offended that's

1280.4 --> 1283.64
right

1280.88 --> 1287.3200000000002
I've noticed that but just talking about

1283.64 --> 1300.0200000000002
God I don't think so

1287.32 --> 1303.1
okay his problem is that he's a troll

1300.02 --> 1306.55
he's shoulda known

1303.1 --> 1306.55
but yeah

1316.77 --> 1319.93
[Music]

1330.13 --> 1333.0590000000002
mm-hmm

1335.66 --> 1343.789
and then like me ride making them feel

1337.82 --> 1347.03
uncomfortable well you can try but yeah

1343.789 --> 1350.6299999999999
that's not the same as caring for like

1347.03 --> 1353.0
caring is like you inside of you having

1350.63 --> 1354.8300000000002
a feeling of I want this person to be

1353.0 --> 1358.46
okay I want this person to be okay

1354.83 --> 1360.4399999999998
that's like the real care now I'm not

1358.46 --> 1362.179
saying that you should excommunicate oh

1360.44 --> 1365.03
and never talk to them again or

1362.179 --> 1368.8090000000002
something but yeah you could approach

1365.03 --> 1370.7
them and basically yeah make them

1368.809 --> 1373.34
uncomfortable confront them with the

1370.7 --> 1375.2
[ __ ] they're doing tried it basically

1373.34 --> 1379.78
this way them made them topple in their

1375.2 --> 1383.96
obsession but that's that's beyond care

1379.78 --> 1386.45
see because even if you manage the top

1383.96 --> 1387.559
of them at that point and they like oh

1386.45 --> 1393.679
[ __ ] what have I done

1387.559 --> 1396.1689999999999
and they retract for me afterward even

1393.679 --> 1399.5300000000002
it's very hard to still care about those

1396.169 --> 1403.6000000000001
people you have to rebuild it's very

1399.53 --> 1407.12
slow poor trusts you no trust in logos

1403.6 --> 1409.58
when somebody when somebody breaks in a

1407.12 --> 1411.76
bad way and keeps on sliding you don't

1409.58 --> 1418.0
just recover from that the next day

1411.76 --> 1418.0
takes a lot of time so

1428.499 --> 1433.869
yeah but yeah sure you can confront them

1434.019 --> 1439.549
just be careful there's a lot of people

1437.45 --> 1441.919
that are used to sitting in sin don't

1439.549 --> 1443.889
like to be confronted and they can like

1441.919 --> 1449.5890000000002
do all kinds of nasty [ __ ]

1443.889 --> 1449.589
including ruining your life some of them

1450.22 --> 1453.279
[Music]

1453.309 --> 1464.719
mmm

1454.46 --> 1466.249
hey batch batch about the way talking

1464.719 --> 1469.21
about God in that way makes him feel

1466.249 --> 1469.21
comfortable all right

1476.87 --> 1484.279
yeah personally when I talk about God

1479.51 --> 1486.83
I'd rather talk about the living the

1484.279 --> 1489.26
things are the design that's what I'm

1486.83 --> 1492.6789999999999
most fascinated about the design the

1489.26 --> 1500.21
purpose how it really works Christ's the

1492.679 --> 1503.02
method all that what good servant I've

1500.21 --> 1503.02
already banned him

1529.46 --> 1537.24
yeah I think you're right good servant

1534.2 --> 1539.46
yeah I think you need to go I don't know

1537.24 --> 1541.83
who you are but you're a troll you're

1539.46 --> 1543.99
the same trolls the other guy and I'm

1541.83 --> 1549.48
gonna chain man because I know you're

1543.99 --> 1552.36
your signature now so good luck with

1549.48 --> 1565.89
that I have no problem banning 20 of

1552.36 --> 1571.08
your sock accounts oh right

1565.89 --> 1575.22
something else yeah I thought it was

1571.08 --> 1577.9099999999999
another funny little detail like Big

1575.22 --> 1581.73
Bear no Benjamin was talking again about

1577.91 --> 1585.3300000000002
how it is to be living in Lobos like he

1581.73 --> 1587.82
does like raising goats and being a

1585.33 --> 1593.82
father and having this farm and all that

1587.82 --> 1596.3999999999999
and doing comedy and that he like bumps

1593.82 --> 1599.34
into other people just in his daily life

1596.4 --> 1604.5900000000001
that are like I don't that better just

1599.34 --> 1608.34
completely perplexed at how talented he

1604.59 --> 1610.1999999999998
is compared to them because yeah there's

1608.34 --> 1613.08
a lot of people out there that just

1610.2 --> 1615.75
don't have any skills it seems it's

1613.08 --> 1617.82
hidden no it's sleeping or something so

1615.75 --> 1622.11
they just see like oh are you an agent

1617.82 --> 1624.12
like a secret agent like in the movie

1622.11 --> 1627.6799999999998
you're so confident you're so smart you

1624.12 --> 1631.52
know so much and yeah that's real thing

1627.68 --> 1636.51
it's weird because I've actually

1631.52 --> 1642.3799999999999
experienced that even in the past I had

1636.51 --> 1645.6299999999999
weird moments where I even acted like

1642.38 --> 1647.7900000000002
like that like other people would say

1645.63 --> 1652.41
like wow you know this you know that wow

1647.79 --> 1655.29
you're so studied are you like with the

1652.41 --> 1657.8700000000001
Secret Service or something and yeah I

1655.29 --> 1661.42
very sneekly now we're talking about my

1657.87 --> 1665.6799999999998
bad time that I said yes

1661.42 --> 1670.5700000000002
and then went with that improvising Lee

1665.68 --> 1672.73
it's crazy what I was doing uh no yeah

1670.57 --> 1675.46
this is farces gun I'm gonna get it's

1672.73 --> 1678.28
not really super insane nefarious story

1675.46 --> 1680.2
or something but it's just not good it's

1678.28 --> 1682.3
not good to act like something you're

1680.2 --> 1685.45
not even though it was inspired by

1682.3 --> 1688.0
people telling me so that story sounded

1685.45 --> 1692.53
really familiar from Owen Benjamin like

1688.0 --> 1694.96
really familiar and hey if you compare

1692.53 --> 1698.5
me now right I have a lot of feedback

1694.96 --> 1700.3
about oh I learned this when that was 12

1698.5 --> 1702.13
and then I couldn't handle it forgot

1700.3 --> 1704.5
again now I remember right I do this a

1702.13 --> 1707.98
lot this is what I do this is my legacy

1704.5 --> 1711.19
here on YouTube well guess what I had

1707.98 --> 1714.82
that knowledge back then as well so if

1711.19 --> 1719.41
when I was then in that era saying these

1714.82 --> 1722.37
things you know it blew people's mind

1719.41 --> 1729.1000000000001
completely away they were like oh

1722.37 --> 1732.1899999999998
because there was no internet okay so

1729.1 --> 1735.55
that's just yeah it seemed like I had a

1732.19 --> 1737.89
giant library in my head I didn't but I

1735.55 --> 1741.04
knew a lot of people that had read a lot

1737.89 --> 1744.4
of books like everybody my family legend

1741.04 --> 1749.02
except me were fanatical book readers my

1744.4 --> 1752.5600000000002
mother my brother and even my dad me not

1749.02 --> 1755.08
so much but I would always tap into them

1752.56 --> 1758.1399999999999
almost literally psionically tap into

1755.08 --> 1760.75
their mind have them explain what they

1758.14 --> 1763.69
learned from the book and then I'd

1760.75 --> 1767.77
assimilated just like that and that's

1763.69 --> 1772.24
how I've gotten a lot of my knowledge I

1767.77 --> 1774.94
basically copy pasted it from people in

1772.24 --> 1778.74
my mind it's how I function

1774.94 --> 1781.27
it's how I learned to learn as a kid

1778.74 --> 1783.43
like I had that skill even like as a

1781.27 --> 1785.35
very very little kid and people were

1783.43 --> 1789.88
astounded by it because I could also

1785.35 --> 1793.9299999999998
that way I guess like a parrot cut like

1789.88 --> 1794.8600000000001
B copy spoken things as a very little

1793.93 --> 1796.1200000000001
kid when I

1794.86 --> 1799.059
wouldn't understand it but I could

1796.12 --> 1801.78
perfectly mimic it I could say it as if

1799.059 --> 1804.07
I could speak the language or something

1801.78 --> 1807.6399999999999
but I didn't understand what it was but

1804.07 --> 1809.6499999999999
if I had enough moment momentum to

1807.64 --> 1813.25
memorize it then I would just wolf as a

1809.65 --> 1816.3600000000001
very very little kid and I learned to

1813.25 --> 1820.6
talk really rap yeah very quickly

1816.36 --> 1824.11
started to get interested in having

1820.6 --> 1825.61
complex conversations with my parents

1824.11 --> 1831.3999999999999
and with other people and that was like

1825.61 --> 1833.29
after five five six was me Legos and

1831.4 --> 1835.1200000000001
when people were there and it was

1833.29 --> 1837.7
getting kind of bored with Legos I would

1835.12 --> 1839.26
go to them and be like whoa what do you

1837.7 --> 1841.96
think about this what do you think about

1839.26 --> 1852.33
my spaceship that I made you know that

1841.96 --> 1852.33
[ __ ] with my Legos anyway

1853.49 --> 1863.66
ah how did how did I roll into this

1856.94 --> 1868.4
conversation right oh yeah yeah being

1863.66 --> 1870.77
seen as a agent right and yeah anyway I

1868.4 --> 1873.44
completely broke the whole set up for

1870.77 --> 1877.37
this what he continued on about then

1873.44 --> 1880.0700000000002
yeah how he is named mr. Smith and so it

1877.37 --> 1883.7299999999998
is why so it's mr. and mrs. Smith the

1880.07 --> 1887.6
agents the agents in the matrix the

1883.73 --> 1890.33
matrix that is our realm which could be

1887.6 --> 1893.57
much more matrix alike than than anybody

1890.33 --> 1896.6499999999999
ever realized although we would not be

1893.57 --> 1902.32
plugged into a computer in the 3d realm

1896.65 --> 1908.27
into entering a sub 3d realm digitized

1902.32 --> 1912.35
but we'd be in a 3d emulated version of

1908.27 --> 1915.85
our 4d reality and hey if you have wide

1912.35 --> 1921.07
access to fourth dimensional reality

1915.85 --> 1925.1299999999999
that means also trans I'm in ways then

1921.07 --> 1927.71
yeah you would almost effectively be as

1925.13 --> 1933.8000000000002
agents in the matrix except it is in the

1927.71 --> 1937.72
real world and it's not computers it's

1933.8 --> 1942.83
spirits and living beings and and

1937.72 --> 1947.929
creators so I thought that was a good

1942.83 --> 1952.3899999999999
enough moment to make a note of that all

1947.929 --> 1955.3700000000001
right and he also went old supernova and

1952.39 --> 1959.69
yeah I wasn't sure at first on this

1955.37 --> 1963.559
person hand robear made Hendron bear

1959.69 --> 1968.24
made a project or he drew for two guys

1963.559 --> 1971.57
that made a book and apparently they

1968.24 --> 1975.38
published this before asking permission

1971.57 --> 1977.6599999999999
from Owen Benjamin and they used a lot

1975.38 --> 1980.24
of his terminologies in everything they

1977.66 --> 1982.48
wrote yeah they paddy was really pissed

1980.24 --> 1982.48
off

1982.73 --> 1989.6390000000001
like yeah he had the look yeah you know

1987.21 --> 1992.759
when Owen Benjamin gets really freakin

1989.639 --> 1995.9399999999998
pissed off when he starts to be like

1992.759 --> 1998.25
this when he starts to put his his jaw

1995.94 --> 2000.6100000000001
forward and his head backward that's

1998.25 --> 2003.71
when he gets really [ __ ] pissed off

2000.61 --> 2007.279
and he was he was like getting all

2003.71 --> 2009.83
red-faced even but yeah plagiarism it's

2007.279 --> 2017.12
hell for a guy like that because it's

2009.83 --> 2019.73
his life's work his words right I don't

2017.12 --> 2022.309
know who else saw that alright anyway

2019.73 --> 2026.0
besides that I went to bed really early

2022.309 --> 2027.85
and I only that watched another movie

2026.0 --> 2031.34
just randomly clicked

2027.85 --> 2035.629
that's what's haven't continue to be

2031.34 --> 2038.269
card yet I don't know need a break Star

2035.629 --> 2041.4189999999999
Trek 5 for a few but I watched into the

2038.269 --> 2047.059
storm which is basically a remake very

2041.419 --> 2050.569
much alike sort of it was just like the

2047.059 --> 2054.5299999999997
storm of the century or was it

2050.569 --> 2056.69
twister yeah twister was in the 90s well

2054.53 --> 2061.2200000000003
into the storm was pretty much that

2056.69 --> 2065.839
movie except a lot more sensible and the

2061.22 --> 2067.9399999999996
graphics were just the best I've ever

2065.839 --> 2071.48
seen for that it was extremely

2067.94 --> 2073.94
convincing you finish dark yet yes I

2071.48 --> 2077.079
have to any one more yes I have I had

2073.94 --> 2077.079
talked about it two days ago

2079.72 --> 2082.4399999999996
yeah

2088.95 --> 2097.609
the best way to predict the future is to

2091.109 --> 2097.609
create interesting

2102.13 --> 2110.53
it's the best way it helps you you know

2107.92 --> 2112.6
if you create it then you will know what

2110.53 --> 2116.6200000000003
will come of it if you understand what

2112.6 --> 2118.48
you're creating so in that sense yes if

2116.62 --> 2123.4
you don't create anything then yeah you

2118.48 --> 2126.16
don't you haven't designed what will

2123.4 --> 2128.28
come so in that sense yes I agree with

2126.16 --> 2128.2799999999997
you

2150.58 --> 2156.18
if you book them they will come wins

2153.7 --> 2156.18
world

2163.3 --> 2168.69
it's unreal or did you just improvise

2166.78 --> 2171.78
that

2168.69 --> 2171.78
[Music]

2175.49 --> 2181.2599999999998
right oh yeah right away also this

2178.17 --> 2189.96
morning saw this is a quantum of

2181.26 --> 2191.7900000000004
consciousness latest video was good it's

2189.96 --> 2194.46
in a way it's almost too bad that he

2191.79 --> 2196.68
doesn't do live streams because I'd be

2194.46 --> 2200.43
fascinated to have like interactive

2196.68 --> 2204.4199999999996
conversations but yeah he just does it

2200.43 --> 2211.74
this way and I thought that this video

2204.42 --> 2221.4
was very good I can't seem to find it

2211.74 --> 2228.1499999999996
back though his channel that is yeah

2221.4 --> 2231.0
anyway he's in a way he does like a lot

2228.15 --> 2233.69
of societal psychological and spirit

2231.0 --> 2238.31
study with matrix concept

2233.69 --> 2242.2200000000003
conceptualization in it in comparing

2238.31 --> 2244.38
lifting the patterns in situations and

2242.22 --> 2248.0099999999998
scenarios and comparing always comparing

2244.38 --> 2251.31
and he's very persistent in the level in

2248.01 --> 2252.9900000000002
the level in how he does it and I can

2251.31 --> 2255.06
very much appreciate that I have a lot

2252.99 --> 2257.7299999999996
of respect for the guy and he's improved

2255.06 --> 2259.2
I fall so now does that because I saw

2257.73 --> 2262.02
him like way in the beginning and he had

2259.2 --> 2264.1499999999996
a look yet more he had a bit of a

2262.02 --> 2267.87
darkness inside him like Owen Benjamin

2264.15 --> 2271.83
even set that and yeah that was there I

2267.87 --> 2276.15
mean kind of like but it seems like he's

2271.83 --> 2279.87
just cleared up a lot and he's really

2276.15 --> 2283.11
got this system now that he's working on

2279.87 --> 2285.7799999999997
with his videos and it's good I am I'm

2283.11 --> 2288.1400000000003
intrigued and I don't think I'm the only

2285.78 --> 2288.1400000000003
one

2300.67 --> 2308.23
hmm I never wanted to predict the future

2305.77 --> 2311.64
but crafting multiple outcomes is

2308.23 --> 2313.839
helpful study the known variables yeah

2311.64 --> 2316.089
well the thing about predicting the

2313.839 --> 2317.0789999999997
future is that it also tends to change

2316.089 --> 2321.46
the future

2317.079 --> 2326.319
it's the cassandra' complex with which I

2321.46 --> 2328.7200000000003
have intense personal experience it's

2326.319 --> 2331.69
only it seems that I'm now being

2328.72 --> 2335.02
relieved of this like the Cassandra

2331.69 --> 2339.64
effect has finally run out I finally am

2335.02 --> 2341.89
getting a grip back it's almost like the

2339.64 --> 2348.2799999999997
experiences I had in the past somehow

2341.89 --> 2353.98
made make me not even realizing that I

2348.28 --> 2358.8900000000003
was doing it make me steal my grip on

2353.98 --> 2362.28
the future by experiencing it and then

2358.89 --> 2367.72
when put back in my body

2362.28 --> 2371.4900000000002
it basically disrupted but what I had

2367.72 --> 2375.0099999999998
seen would still come out it's just that

2371.49 --> 2378.49
the whole context of how I thought it

2375.01 --> 2382.9900000000002
was gonna be would not be possible and

2378.49 --> 2384.819
it's it's like paradox it's very tough

2382.99 --> 2387.43
it's even tough to explain

2384.819 --> 2388.119
it's just that yeah I'm not very happy

2387.43 --> 2392.8799999999997
about it

2388.119 --> 2396.19
I'm not very happy that it happened and

2392.88 --> 2399.1600000000003
I was originally fascinated with like

2396.19 --> 2405.339
vivid visions especially if they related

2399.16 --> 2412.3289999999997
to the near future but yeah then then

2405.339 --> 2416.19
Jesuit guy happened and just this yeah

2412.329 --> 2416.19
it's almost like they forced me to

2418.579 --> 2423.53
use it all up in one moment I don't even

2421.829 --> 2427.5890000000004
know what that means

2423.53 --> 2430.5890000000004
but that's kind of what they did I think

2427.589 --> 2432.5099999999998
they forced me to you like in the fourth

2430.589 --> 2435.9
dimension or something in the dark world

2432.51 --> 2437.9100000000003
they just forced me to squeeze it all to

2435.9 --> 2440.01
experience it all right now and it's

2437.91 --> 2441.8689999999997
very damaging to do that and it's

2440.01 --> 2446.51
completely useless they forced me to

2441.869 --> 2452.309
expand yeah to expel my power almost

2446.51 --> 2454.5
because they I was a a big threat also

2452.309 --> 2460.26
one of the reasons why I think they even

2454.5 --> 2463.46
tried to to make me and myself like

2460.26 --> 2466.2000000000003
because they know what I was going to do

2463.46 --> 2469.319
they know that I was gonna do this that

2466.2 --> 2472.14
I was gonna break the lie and like

2469.319 --> 2477.92
really break it and I wasn't gonna be

2472.14 --> 2485.5989999999997
alone but I would be very good and yeah

2477.92 --> 2485.599
the Jesuit guy survived of a web of lies

2485.63 --> 2495.299
that is their world and back then even

2491.73 --> 2497.28
if I just say Flat Earth right and this

2495.299 --> 2501.03
happened isn't it he would physically

2497.28 --> 2504.869
punish me just by saying it you would

2501.03 --> 2510.21
literally just yeah bash me in the

2504.869 --> 2517.1400000000003
shoulder and not likely that was back

2510.21 --> 2520.079
then that was 20 years ago right because

2517.14 --> 2521.97
they were afraid they are the wielders

2520.079 --> 2526.829
of the globe they are the keepers of it

2521.97 --> 2528.72
and the truth is exponentially dangerous

2526.829 --> 2532.079
to them because they need everybody to

2528.72 --> 2536.0299999999997
be asleep in order for the dream to keep

2532.079 --> 2539.9100000000003
on working and keep on making the people

2536.03 --> 2542.73
come to them to give them money that's

2539.91 --> 2546.45
how the the priests system basically

2542.73 --> 2548.75
works at it of the globe because that's

2546.45 --> 2548.75
what it is

2556.12 --> 2568.33
no good sir it wasn't draining my spirit

2558.91 --> 2570.8199999999997
that didst it was if anything the

2568.33 --> 2575.73
mechanism in my brain the probably

2570.82 --> 2579.46
pineal gland related that is indirect

2575.73 --> 2581.95
it's like the the dream bridge that was

2579.46 --> 2585.15
very good with me it's like I can almost

2581.95 --> 2588.25
yeah like I would I was a dream Walker

2585.15 --> 2590.62
I'm not so much a dream Walker anymore I

2588.25 --> 2593.61
can't do it anymore like that because of

2590.62 --> 2597.0699999999997
what happened and they basically made me

2593.61 --> 2600.19
burn it burn the bridge metaphorically

2597.07 --> 2601.78
by over exhausting it in the moment

2600.19 --> 2603.36
that's what they tried they didn't

2601.78 --> 2606.52
destroy it though

2603.36 --> 2608.59
it's just they said yeah it's you can't

2606.52 --> 2612.46
do this anymore now because you've spent

2608.59 --> 2615.61
it all that's what they said no I don't

2612.46 --> 2618.4900000000002
know if it is true I don't even really

2615.61 --> 2620.11
care to find out because of everything

2618.49 --> 2627.1299999999997
that's surrounded that the experience

2620.11 --> 2631.26
was very nightmarish for me but I will

2627.13 --> 2633.79
certainly talk with people about it

2631.26 --> 2635.5
privately yeah well of course I talked a

2633.79 --> 2640.54
little bit about it here but I will talk

2635.5 --> 2645.16
about experts real experts experts by my

2640.54 --> 2647.38
standards in these subjects in yeah

2645.16 --> 2651.1299999999997
involving ayahuasca involving complex

2647.38 --> 2654.1
spiritual journeys as shamans like but

2651.13 --> 2658.75
really serious I will not be scanned I

2654.1 --> 2661.75
will get 2nd 3rd 4th opinions because I

2658.75 --> 2664.39
want to know really what happened what

2661.75 --> 2668.38
exactly was the physiological process

2664.39 --> 2670.68
that I had been forced through what did

2668.38 --> 2673.15
really happen what would they say

2670.68 --> 2675.24
typically a person would have as a

2673.15 --> 2679.36
response does that correlate with what I

2675.24 --> 2685.74
experienced to really figure it out I've

2679.36 --> 2685.7400000000002
never done this to afraid I will do it

2686.38 --> 2694.04
and then who knows maybe at some point

2689.54 --> 2695.93
it's I will see a necessity to basically

2694.04 --> 2698.98
do something like that again

2695.93 --> 2702.859
but this time under my control

2698.98 --> 2705.59
with a very strong determination of how

2702.859 --> 2708.56
things are what should be done what I

2705.59 --> 2710.1800000000003
should not care about especially because

2708.56 --> 2713.57
I cared about a lot of things that I

2710.18 --> 2719.6299999999997
shouldn't twenty years ago I really

2713.57 --> 2722.03
shouldn't have haunts me and yeah who

2719.63 --> 2726.32
knows maybe I can re-enter the fourth

2722.03 --> 2729.17
dimension twenty years later in how I am

2726.32 --> 2734.9300000000003
now and maybe even reach back through

2729.17 --> 2737.06
time contacts my former spirit that I

2734.93 --> 2741.35
was twenty years ago basically to make

2737.06 --> 2743.119
him stop it sounds really surreal right

2741.35 --> 2746.2999999999997
well that's what happens in the fourth

2743.119 --> 2750.34
dimension because I have met myself

2746.3 --> 2753.8590000000004
there literally older and younger and

2750.34 --> 2757.73
it's really surreal when when you get to

2753.859 --> 2760.0699999999997
meet in your in your conscious lifetime

2757.73 --> 2764.359
if you literally meet yourself from the

2760.07 --> 2767.3590000000004
future don't ask too much that's my

2764.359 --> 2770.29
advice but the thing about it is it's

2767.359 --> 2775.25
not even the words it's just seeing

2770.29 --> 2778.19
myself older having the condensed spirit

2775.25 --> 2782.44
energy because it was real that was real

2778.19 --> 2787.64
that wasn't an emulation seeing that and

2782.44 --> 2792.2000000000003
then feeling wow there is so much more

2787.64 --> 2794.77
that I will become feeling it not not

2792.2 --> 2798.47
hearing it not seeing it just

2794.77 --> 2804.29
recognizing it in the essence of what I

2798.47 --> 2806.6299999999997
was facing my other self right yeah

2804.29 --> 2808.69
start over is abyss grace big risk I

2806.63 --> 2808.69
know

2810.24 --> 2821.2
the weird thing though is that I've seen

2813.73 --> 2822.76
it I've seen that it's like almost it's

2821.2 --> 2828.46
bound to happen because I've already

2822.76 --> 2830.98
seen myself doing that and at first I

2828.46 --> 2832.6
thought that was like an evil me it's

2830.98 --> 2834.52
like oh my god that's like the

2832.6 --> 2836.44
Antichrist me or something you know I

2834.52 --> 2838.03
had to love my ideas going all over the

2836.44 --> 2839.59
place 20 years ago with that and I

2838.03 --> 2841.96
didn't literally didn't know what the

2839.59 --> 2844.1800000000003
hell I'd gotten into I didn't understand

2841.96 --> 2848.19
what was happening even though last

2844.18 --> 2851.19
frickin 80 years when it initiated okay

2848.19 --> 2856.36
yes

2851.19 --> 2858.52
consciously and strain wise she didn't

2856.36 --> 2863.5
live through 80 years in a minute it's

2858.52 --> 2865.62
not healthy it's survivable for most I'd

2863.5 --> 2869.62
say hmm

2865.62 --> 2871.3199999999997
but yeah maybe I am going to do it and

2869.62 --> 2875.44
I've already seen it

2871.32 --> 2878.4700000000003
I've already seen myself unleashed but

2875.44 --> 2881.7400000000002
not unleashed to evil but actually

2878.47 --> 2890.98
released from evil it's just because I

2881.74 --> 2893.47
was yeah in it that the world was inside

2890.98 --> 2896.86
out for me from my perspective at the

2893.47 --> 2899.5499999999997
time it's pretty incredible realization

2896.86 --> 2899.55
really

2914.96 --> 2924.319
I'd like to get another educated shot

2917.299 --> 2926.63
one on how to do what exactly match yeah

2924.319 --> 2930.2599999999998
I know I liked the last ten minutes are

2926.63 --> 2932.48
really vague I know they're Vegas [ __ ]

2930.26 --> 2934.9100000000003
and when I'm gonna watch this back I'm

2932.48 --> 2937.76
gonna listen and I'm gonna say man yeah

2934.91 --> 2941.089
that was Vegas [ __ ] but it's the only

2937.76 --> 2943.119
thing it is I guess I could elaborate on

2941.089 --> 2946.93
it more it's just the experience I had

2943.119 --> 2951.4
what that was and the ability to

2946.93 --> 2956.5389999999998
literally face yourself from the future

2951.4 --> 2962.63
in different states for example I also

2956.539 --> 2965.539
did meet my my Christian self I met

2962.63 --> 2967.609
myself I was basically faced with my

2965.539 --> 2969.349
future self wearing white very

2967.609 --> 2971.3289999999997
interestingly enough and I was like what

2969.349 --> 2975.799
what is this yeah white clothes that I

2971.329 --> 2978.529
have like the cloak the white cloak I

2975.799 --> 2982.7889999999998
was wearing it in that it wasn't even

2978.529 --> 2985.549
made yet okay that's the freaky thing

2982.789 --> 2988.01
about visions that reach into the future

2985.549 --> 2990.44
and I met myself and it was like why are

2988.01 --> 2993.65
you sure you need to do this because I

2990.44 --> 2998.2400000000002
was afraid I was afraid of Christ I was

2993.65 --> 2999.859
afraid that if you'd like that you would

2998.24 --> 3004.27
be killed I was afraid of that

2999.859 --> 3008.799
I was afraid if I'm gonna do that then

3004.27 --> 3012.279
I'll die but that was a lie in retro I

3008.799 --> 3019.24
was a bluff in retrospect and took me

3012.279 --> 3021.039
way too long to figure that one out what

3019.24 --> 3024.25
it technically meant is not that they

3021.039 --> 3027.2700000000004
would kill me it's rather than they

3024.25 --> 3030.309
would kill their care for me their

3027.27 --> 3032.859
interest in me that's what they

3030.309 --> 3035.77
technically meant it's like a little

3032.859 --> 3038.88
lawyer trick that you can use as a

3035.77 --> 3038.88
massive bluff

3041.769 --> 3049.0389999999998
it's really evil to do that by the way

3044.779 --> 3050.8
it like really [ __ ] evil yeah but

3049.039 --> 3053.909
they are

3050.8 --> 3053.909
[Music]

3062.18 --> 3070.5789999999997
yeah wait what come back and tie and

3067.039 --> 3083.8390000000004
give your kid you the step up now I've

3070.579 --> 3087.349
already done that yeah but I did it from

3083.839 --> 3090.14
a wrong position it was more like a four

3087.349 --> 3093.619
boat to my young self like in the future

3090.14 --> 3095.569
you're going to go to a bad place and I

3093.619 --> 3098.48
didn't wanna that was my younger

3095.569 --> 3100.7
response like I don't want this why are

3098.48 --> 3102.039
you doing this I don't want this leave

3100.7 --> 3104.93
me alone

3102.039 --> 3108.3190000000004
stop pretending like you're this big

3104.93 --> 3110.799
shot that was my younger self respond

3108.319 --> 3110.799
back then

3115.47 --> 3122.7599999999998
what I meant is not it's no use trying

3119.099 --> 3125.4
to find like I'm not gonna alter the

3122.76 --> 3127.4100000000003
past like it's dark or something you

3125.4 --> 3129.15
know like in the dark there's no there's

3127.41 --> 3131.0099999999998
no time door I'm gonna be walking

3129.15 --> 3134.13
through in a no freakin tunnel thank you

3131.01 --> 3136.92
very much and I don't have a Pokeball

3134.13 --> 3142.07
time machine either oh that would be

3136.92 --> 3142.07
very interesting but what I meant is

3142.31 --> 3150.39
having the current version of myself in

3146.64 --> 3152.64
the spiritual realm parallel to the

3150.39 --> 3155.3399999999997
others because in the spiritual realm

3152.64 --> 3157.2599999999998
things do go through time it's more

3155.34 --> 3159.69
flexible doesn't mean that I can

3157.26 --> 3167.099
physically change thing in the past but

3159.69 --> 3172.28
you can nudge energies it's I think you

3167.099 --> 3175.77
can just or yeah just having seen myself

3172.28 --> 3178.38
already kind of helps because back in

3175.77 --> 3180.54
the day I had like very little out for

3178.38 --> 3183.27
myself in the future I thought like now

3180.54 --> 3186.9
I am doing I'm gonna end like like

3183.27 --> 3191.22
horrific and and it but I didn't really

3186.9 --> 3193.4700000000003
understand even why but I really thought

3191.22 --> 3195.5099999999998
that it's like I'm doomed I'm like

3193.47 --> 3197.7
literally thought that and nobody would

3195.51 --> 3201.03
dissuade me and I wasn't even

3197.7 --> 3203.25
necessarily like really depressed it's

3201.03 --> 3206.7000000000003
just that I didn't see a future for

3203.25 --> 3209.88
myself I thought this I'm gonna end like

3206.7 --> 3213.96
even if I try and I wanted but I just

3209.88 --> 3216.15
thought I couldn't make it and yeah

3213.96 --> 3220.56
that's also been kind of told to me by a

3216.15 --> 3225.15
lot of people as I've said this way back

3220.56 --> 3229.589
beginning the Flat Earth Flat Earth

3225.15 --> 3231.54
talks that yeah I typically had a

3229.589 --> 3233.25
response like the half of the people

3231.54 --> 3235.38
would think I would be great like wow

3233.25 --> 3237.119
that kid is really awesome and the other

3235.38 --> 3238.339
half would be like oh I hate him he's

3237.119 --> 3242.609
the devil

3238.339 --> 3245.97
really really so yeah a lot of people

3242.609 --> 3250.0699999999997
told me yeah you have no future as a kid

3245.97 --> 3250.0699999999997
they would just tell me it was horrific

3251.09 --> 3260.07
because I believed it I was very open to

3255.99 --> 3261.99
other people even to people I shouldn't

3260.07 --> 3264.06
have been open to because yeah I was

3261.99 --> 3265.62
just trying to figure out the world and

3264.06 --> 3266.46
it would open up and then people would

3265.62 --> 3268.56
do that [ __ ]

3266.46 --> 3271.88
and eventually I felt like a freak

3268.56 --> 3274.29
because yeah people would say that I am

3271.88 --> 3280.13
that it doesn't even relate to flatter

3274.29 --> 3291.12
earth or anything just me and my things

3280.13 --> 3292.86
and well if I can basically yeah this is

3291.12 --> 3295.17
weird because I've already done it even

3292.86 --> 3296.82
though in the 3d world I still have to

3295.17 --> 3298.4700000000003
do it but I've already seen it as I

3296.82 --> 3303.75
explained I've already seen my future

3298.47 --> 3305.9399999999996
self and even though during the

3303.75 --> 3310.38
experience which was anchored in my

3305.94 --> 3313.29
let's just say around my 20s spiritual

3310.38 --> 3316.62
version of that that spirit that I was

3313.29 --> 3318.9
in that anchor point right then that's

3316.62 --> 3321.0299999999997
the only thing I could interpret things

3318.9 --> 3323.61
with with the mindset and spirit that I

3321.03 --> 3327.9
had back then in that specific time in

3323.61 --> 3330.51
the 3d world but that set spirit and

3327.9 --> 3334.05
mind would be going through our time not

3330.51 --> 3336.42
altering right so if I can do something

3334.05 --> 3338.82
like that again but with my current

3336.42 --> 3341.81
learnt and much more confident spirit

3338.82 --> 3346.32
then I could potentially reach back

3341.81 --> 3348.5099999999998
through the dark world and basically

3346.32 --> 3350.01
yeah do what I was probably meant to do

3348.51 --> 3351.3
because I've already seen it even though

3350.01 --> 3357.3900000000003
I didn't understand that during the

3351.3 --> 3360.78
vision imprint my current more whole and

3357.39 --> 3363.95
complete state through the fourth

3360.78 --> 3366.5400000000004
dimension on to my life retro actively

3363.95 --> 3370.3199999999997
yeah sounds really science fictiony

3366.54 --> 3372.44
doesn't it it's the best I can make with

3370.32 --> 3372.44
it

3381.88 --> 3388.829
mama died from farm chemicals Azula

3385.829 --> 3388.829
okay

3393.75 --> 3397.73
that sounds messed up batch batch

3409.27 --> 3416.65
is that form chemicals as in roundup or

3412.42 --> 3420.33
something or artificial fertilizer

3416.65 --> 3422.619
because those can be extremely toxic to

3420.33 --> 3424.7999999999997
what kind of chemicals are you talking

3422.619 --> 3424.8
about

3428.71 --> 3436.77
and right pesticides yeah

3436.92 --> 3443.6800000000003
not around up okay okay well good

3440.5 --> 3447.07
because roundup if yeah if your mother

3443.68 --> 3449.859
would have died from that and you had it

3447.07 --> 3452.71
oh you view my problem you probably

3449.859 --> 3459.58
wouldn't have lived roundup is really

3452.71 --> 3462.01
[ __ ] up yeah ended by your accumulates

3459.58 --> 3467.08
it's one of the worst things it's it

3462.01 --> 3469.9
puts its it it dissolves in your fat it

3467.08 --> 3471.73
doesn't want to come out it's very tough

3469.9 --> 3474.9900000000002
to to get it out of your system

3471.73 --> 3474.9900000000002
you can last a lifetime

3486.71 --> 3494.3
right any any questions or anything

3490.19 --> 3496.9900000000002
before I round out the show lots of

3494.3 --> 3496.9900000000002
vision talk

3518.59 --> 3521.7490000000003
[Music]

3528.89 --> 3536.089
yeah I knows that that be Nathan starts

3531.44 --> 3541.969
his show like half an hour ago and then

3536.089 --> 3545.499
he goes live in three minutes from now I

3541.969 --> 3545.4990000000003
don't is not live right down

3550.8 --> 3557.01
we'll be any minute anyway yeah I'm

3553.8 --> 3562.0800000000004
gonna run out the show I hope yeah you

3557.01 --> 3564.7200000000003
guys could follow it somewhat don't know

3562.08 --> 3568.41
if yeah if that made any sense to you

3564.72 --> 3571.0099999999998
but the whole fourth-dimensional dark

3568.41 --> 3575.67
world situation reaching throughout time

3571.01 --> 3577.38
you know that it's not meant a science

3575.67 --> 3580.14
fiction just to be clear I'm not trying

3577.38 --> 3582.869
to this is based on things that I've

3580.14 --> 3584.73
literally experienced and I'm still in

3582.869 --> 3588.2000000000003
the process of trying to figure it out

3584.73 --> 3591.93
it's very very very complex I've already

3588.2 --> 3594.18
yeah explained it many times why it is

3591.93 --> 3600.81
so complex because there's just many

3594.18 --> 3602.8199999999997
angles to it and mistakes it's like you

3600.81 --> 3604.619
think it's one thing in a certain

3602.82 --> 3605.8500000000004
situation and then you think of it

3604.619 --> 3610.83
certainly is a completely different

3605.85 --> 3613.74
thing in another situation but yeah was

3610.83 --> 3615.7799999999997
it even in a time was it even a town

3613.74 --> 3620.1899999999996
time-bound experience or was it more

3615.78 --> 3622.1090000000004
like a an aberration that just in grains

3620.19 --> 3624.0
itself in the fourth dimension on the

3622.109 --> 3626.2799999999997
other side throughout your experience

3624.0 --> 3629.85
and it's unplaceable but it has

3626.28 --> 3632.6400000000003
different spiritual contexts from

3629.85 --> 3634.41
different perspectives from different

3632.64 --> 3635.85
points in your life when you're going to

3634.41 --> 3642.21
remember it you know that kind of thing

3635.85 --> 3644.67
