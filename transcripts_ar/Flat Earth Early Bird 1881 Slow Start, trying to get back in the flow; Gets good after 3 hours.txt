H Little Tommy

577.16 --> 584.16
sve everybody had a good day so far

581.48 --> 588.64
yeah decent enough I mean with the sun

584.16 --> 591.36
and I've been up very early I I don't

588.64 --> 593.279
know but when the sun is like shining

591.36 --> 597.04
like that through the window in the

593.279 --> 600.04
morning like I don't know I just get

597.04 --> 603.079
up it's weird man

600.04 --> 606.12
like my sleeping system is just working

603.079 --> 608.399
differently now it's very hard to get

606.12 --> 608.399
used

620.6 --> 623.8000000000001
to all

628.04 --> 631.04
right

647.079 --> 652.0
Skype easier to use on PC yeah

658.04 --> 661.04
probably

677.839 --> 684.9200000000001
did I message you on Skype uh

681.8 --> 687.76
no but I mean you are in the early bird

684.92 --> 687.76
Skype group

687.959 --> 690.959
so

715.2 --> 720.9590000000001
right so damn I still haven't continued

717.72 --> 720.9590000000001
watching those movies

725.04 --> 728.24
just never got to

747.88 --> 750.88
it

777.839 --> 780.839
for

837.759 --> 840.759
for

842.12 --> 845.32
[Music]

867.68 --> 870.68
now

883.759 --> 888.6
this is a country contradictory to not

887.0 --> 891.68
be religious but have experience with

888.6 --> 891.6800000000001
demons no not at

892.399 --> 897.68
all although you might just not

894.8 --> 900.68
recognize them as

897.68 --> 900.68
demons

927.6 --> 930.6
all

945.0 --> 951.319
right so yeah guys I really need to like

948.279 --> 953.759
figure out what to talk

951.319 --> 956.16
about or I'm just going to be yawning

953.759 --> 957.6
again all show and I don't really want

956.16 --> 960.56
to do

957.6 --> 963.12
that belief in God and religion separate

960.56 --> 963.1199999999999
things

985.399 --> 991.199
yeah

987.519 --> 993.5600000000001
right talking about which like I wanted

991.199 --> 996.04
to express again my thankfulness for all

993.56 --> 996.04
of you

997.319 --> 1002.88
guys

998.839 --> 1004.759
and yeah just this entire Journey that

1002.88 --> 1007.8
I've had here on the

1004.759 --> 1009.0
channel I don't know how long it's it's

1007.8 --> 1013.04
going to

1009.0 --> 1016.16
last but yeah I'd love to keep going but

1013.04 --> 1019.0
there are circumstances out there that I

1016.16 --> 1021.319
don't know I don't know exactly what is

1019.0 --> 1021.319
going to

1028.24 --> 1032.799
happen

1029.88 --> 1034.3190000000002
and in

1032.799 --> 1037.439
ways

1034.319 --> 1040.52
like my peace of mind and my confidence

1037.439 --> 1043.919
have gotten like a major dent and I

1040.52 --> 1043.9189999999999
don't know if I can restore

1047.4 --> 1051.76
that cuz my mind has been playing tricks

1050.6 --> 1055.0
on me

1051.76 --> 1059.16
again in a pretty big

1055.0 --> 1060.76
way going to do another a thank you

1059.16 --> 1064.559
thank you for the void of confidence

1060.76 --> 1064.559
clutch I really appreciate

1065.84 --> 1073.559
that if I could get back to normal I

1070.559 --> 1073.559
would

1077.4 --> 1083.6000000000001
definitely

1080.2 --> 1085.039
right but for now I just I need to

1083.6 --> 1086.9599999999998
express that

1085.039 --> 1090.679
I'm just

1086.96 --> 1094.88
thankful for the life that I've had even

1090.679 --> 1098.159
though I didn't like get yet the wife

1094.88 --> 1098.159
that I wanted or anything

1101.039 --> 1108.12
and and a lot of things

1103.88 --> 1109.2800000000002
like made it very hard for me in my life

1108.12 --> 1111.28
but

1109.28 --> 1116.08
despite all of that

1111.28 --> 1117.9189999999999
like I was able to behold just the

1116.08 --> 1120.76
beauty of

1117.919 --> 1125.64
Nature and the mysteries of

1120.76 --> 1125.64
man and the mind in the

1125.799 --> 1131.4
past

1127.72 --> 1134.24
and basically the the weird pitfalls of

1131.4 --> 1137.44
the mind I've explored the Mind

1134.24 --> 1140.72
including my own but even in exploring

1137.44 --> 1143.559
my own mind I I've figured out there are

1140.72 --> 1146.559
certain things that I like I

1143.559 --> 1146.559
cannot

1166.64 --> 1172.5200000000002
overcome and are arguably they're

1169.039 --> 1176.919
they're good traits I mean like a good

1172.52 --> 1180.48
trait that like I have to be free or

1176.919 --> 1180.48
literally I will just stop

1180.919 --> 1184.6000000000001
functioning I have to be

1191.72 --> 1200.24
free but there are things in the world

1194.72 --> 1200.24
that that don't want anybody to be free

1200.559 --> 1210.84
and I thought I yeah I managed to do it

1206.2 --> 1210.8400000000001
all right and get past it

1212.2 --> 1216.0
but I'm not so sure

1227.159 --> 1230.159
anymore

1238.4 --> 1244.2
you can't

1241.2 --> 1244.2
tell

1247.36 --> 1253.0
what what do you mean you can't tell

1250.12 --> 1253.0
something needs to

1257.12 --> 1260.12
change

1284.799 --> 1292.08
I just I don't know I want to meet more

1289.12 --> 1295.4799999999998
people I I really have that feeling I've

1292.08 --> 1296.8799999999999
never had it so much as in the last few

1295.48 --> 1300.559
weeks that I

1296.88 --> 1304.5200000000002
just I've been all always for a very

1300.559 --> 1307.559
long time avoidant of people in

1304.52 --> 1310.36
general and now I get this feeling like

1307.559 --> 1313.279
I really want to get to know

1310.36 --> 1317.32
everybody like in the neighborhood and

1313.279 --> 1320.72

1752.399 --> 1757.5189999999998
therapy here that does not involve

couple of weeks and it's just it's been

this is not just some random

2289.0 --> 2297.119
depression that's happening B

2292.88 --> 2297.119
tobster this is not random at

2299.24 --> 2304.3999999999996
all this is

2301.56 --> 2308.52
like a lot of my suppressed memories

2304.4 --> 2308.52
suddenly revealing themselves to me

2310.28 --> 2317.6800000000003
and me basically arriving in a position

2313.319 --> 2317.68
where I don't know what to do not

2319.359 --> 2326.0
really and it's like the only offer

2323.2 --> 2328.64
everybody gives me is to just like yeah

2326.0 --> 2331.04
just trust God and it's your time it's

2328.64 --> 2335.52
your time

2331.04 --> 2338.52
and everything is just like agreeing to

2335.52 --> 2338.52
that

2343.599 --> 2349.599
so maybe it's like maybe nothing will

2347.64 --> 2353.319
happen maybe something will happen and

2349.599 --> 2353.319
there's just nothing I can do about

mean I forgive

2441.359 --> 2444.88
him I really

2453.96 --> 2460.16
do maybe it's just maybe I'm heartbroken

2457.52 --> 2462.119
maybe that is what it's coming

2460.16 --> 2464.319
from

2462.119 --> 2468.2400000000002
like I feel

2464.319 --> 2472.44
like no matter what the circumstances

2468.24 --> 2475.2799999999997
are like it doesn't work

2490.16 --> 2495.3999999999996
that like that have basically poisoned

2493.839 --> 2498.4
the well in a

2495.4 --> 2500.52
way that I don't know how that can ever

2498.4 --> 2504.2000000000003
be

2500.52 --> 2507.599

2515.24 --> 2518.24
guess

2536.24 --> 2543.64
what did Nathan say no it's not about

2539.319 --> 2546.0
the words or anything it's the overall

2543.64 --> 2550.5989999999997

through severe torture in the Dark World

ever do you

2635.079 --> 2638.079

you Everything's

2677.76 --> 2684.119
changed Everything's

2679.88 --> 2685.8
changed like how I see how I even see

2684.119 --> 2687.359
the trolling has

2685.8 --> 2690.28
changed

2687.359 --> 2692.839
like I actually have more sympathy for

2690.28 --> 2692.8390000000004
you guys

2693.44 --> 2698.8
now considering like what I've become

2696.72 --> 2702.2799999999997
aware

2698.8 --> 2707.079
of maybe you guys are like in similar

2702.28 --> 2707.079
packages and like you just have to do

2707.24 --> 2718.4399999999996
it and maybe I am like in a

2711.559 --> 2720.96
way blind like painful painful with my

2718.44 --> 2724.16
honesty that I really push and I

2720.96 --> 2726.52
weaponize my own honesty and I thought

2724.16 --> 2729.52
like that that'll keep me safe that get

2726.52 --> 2729.52
me through everything

2730.2 --> 2736.5989999999997
but I have heard people I have heard

2733.48 --> 2737.92
people too that didn't really deserve it

2736.599 --> 2741.3590000000004
and now

2737.92 --> 2746.16
even that I feel like this I feel really

2741.359 --> 2749.319
ashamed about about some of my

2746.16 --> 2752.92
wrath which like under the circumstances

2749.319 --> 2754.88
I could reason is reasonable but

2752.92 --> 2758.7200000000003
it

2754.88 --> 2758.7200000000003
but really it

2767.44 --> 2772.88
isn't I don't know I just feel kind of

2769.839 --> 2772.88
melodramatic or

2774.559 --> 2781.0
something but I mean this is not like oh

happy I I want to say something really

2876.559 --> 2881.7200000000003
weird but I mean in a way I'm I'm

2879.92 --> 2882.44
actually kind of thankful for some of

2881.72 --> 2885.7599999999998
the

2882.44 --> 2891.4
trolling some of the trolling has like

2885.76 --> 2894.0400000000004
enabled me to move on to break through a

2891.4 --> 2897.359
situation this sounds really weird me

2894.04 --> 2901.7599999999998
like thanking the Trolls but I

2897.359 --> 2901.7599999999998
mean I mean in God's

2901.839 --> 2906.359
plan they do have a role people have

2904.4 --> 2908.119
been telling me this and was just like

2906.359 --> 2912.119
but I can't deal with it I just can't

2908.119 --> 2916.2000000000003
deal but now that I've like gone through

2912.119 --> 2919.6800000000003
this transition thing through this

2916.2 --> 2922.96
transformation I do see it now I see

2919.68 --> 2927.7599999999998
it the trolling does seem to also go

2922.96 --> 2927.76
down even it has gone down a

2933.2 --> 2937.5989999999997
bit did they hurt me

2964.52 --> 2967.52
no

2981.839 --> 2988.319
no no nobody's heard

2985.319 --> 2988.319
me

2994.52 --> 2997.52
yet

3015.44 --> 3019.559
no

3016.559 --> 3019.559
duper

3021.24 --> 3027.4399999999996
no doesn't work

3024.44 --> 3027.44
anymore

3028.2 --> 3031.96
the well has been poisoned in a

3034.559 --> 3040.88
way that can't be fixed I I can't be

3038.48 --> 3043.4
myself

3040.88 --> 3047.559
anymore and apologies aren't going to

3043.4 --> 3047.559
change that they really

3053.359 --> 3059.04
want right it it's like a relationship

3056.52 --> 3063.88
and at some point like certain things

3059.04 --> 3063.88
happen that just like you can't fix it

3067.24 --> 3075.799
anymore and it's not even like about

3070.48 --> 3075.799
what happened on some live show or

3078.88 --> 3084.2000000000003
anything so I'd appreciate if you just

3081.359 --> 3087.04
drop that yeah this is not about you

3084.2 --> 3090.839
think I'm gon to get emotional here

3087.04 --> 3093.0
because I really need an apology from

3090.839 --> 3095.88
somebody think again

3093.0 --> 3100.72
duper that's not how things work in the

3095.88 --> 3100.7200000000003
world that's not how this works at

3101.24 --> 3111.319
all if that were the case I would be

3105.599 --> 3111.319
angry and frustrated I don't feel like

3278.24 --> 3281.24
busy

busy just healing people left and right

3306.72 --> 3312.0
all over the place I mean I was all

3309.68 --> 3316.04
impressed that I healed skeptic at one

3312.0 --> 3318.48
time so significantly and illg a bit he

3316.04 --> 3321.319
did realize that afterward but I mean My

3318.48 --> 3327.88
Healer does that

3321.319 --> 3330.7599999999998
like 30 40 times a day a day every day

3327.88 --> 3334.079
like it's just

3330.76 --> 3339.19
surreal I can barely believe

3334.079 --> 3342.369
it but I mean I want to be able to do

3339.19 --> 3342.369
[Music]

3343.48 --> 3349.44
that and it I'm noticing that even my

3346.72 --> 3352.319
metabolism and everything is

3349.44 --> 3355.52
like there's been a a

3352.319 --> 3359.2
physiological change in me

3355.52 --> 3362.119
like suddenly I can't handle cannabis

3359.2 --> 3365.2799999999997
anymore like at all and I've been trying

3362.119 --> 3368.48
to like micro do with it and even that

3365.28 --> 3371.52
is like

3368.48 --> 3374.28
no it's almost like it's dangerous to me

3371.52 --> 3376.4
now it's very very big difference I

3374.28 --> 3379.7200000000003
haven't

3376.4 --> 3379.7200000000003
felt like

3380.119 --> 3386.559
this in a long

3383.2 --> 3389.8799999999997
time and it's different

3386.559 --> 3392.76
like I re my my physiology like the way

3389.88 --> 3395.1600000000003
the chemistry and the feelings work is

3392.76 --> 3398.96
different I'm like a different

3395.16 --> 3401.72
person it's very

3398.96 --> 3405.92
bizarre never tried get this how just

3401.72 --> 3405.9199999999996
don't I'm way too young for that anyway

3410.119 --> 3416.88
duper all right slicka yeah you take

3414.359 --> 3416.88
care as well

3416.96 --> 3424.839
well thanks for being in this in the

3420.599 --> 3424.839
chat three or four times over the

3425.0 --> 3431.319
year yeah I guess yeah but that one time

3428.2 --> 3431.319
it like was pretty

3434.0 --> 3440.96
significant but yeah I I have help more

3437.319 --> 3442.72
like I just I don't even remember those

3440.96 --> 3446.119
things like when helping because it's

3442.72 --> 3449.3999999999996
like to me that's like holding open the

3446.119 --> 3452.799
door for a lady like it's just it's so

3449.4 --> 3455.88
automatic I don't even like remember

3452.799 --> 3458.68
it it's like yeah of course I do that I

3455.88 --> 3461.119
can do that no I'm going to do that I

3458.68 --> 3464.799
don't even like keep

3461.119 --> 3466.96
count healer sounds like a scam yeah but

3464.799 --> 3466.96
it

3469.599 --> 3476.799
isn't yeah it's a scam where like he

3473.52 --> 3476.799
doesn't ask money for it

3476.88 --> 3479.799
tell me how that's a

3480.599 --> 3487.2000000000003
scam I'd say it's diametrically in

3484.4 --> 3490.92
opposition to a scam it's about as nons

3487.2 --> 3490.9199999999996
scam as you could possibly

3497.52 --> 3501.319
imagine I mean that's like saying Jesus

3500.4 --> 3503.28
was a

3501.319 --> 3506.52
scam

3503.28 --> 3509.96
right what because he just healed

3506.52 --> 3513.24
people and taught them wise things he

3509.96 --> 3515.88
didn't ask money for it right and

3513.24 --> 3515.8799999999997
neither does my

3518.72 --> 3524.52
healer he does actually ask some

3521.359 --> 3528.44
maintenance from certain people that are

3524.52 --> 3531.7599999999998
wealthier right kind of like I ask for

3528.44 --> 3536.039
donations to keep going with my channel

3531.76 --> 3537.76
well yeah like that but I mean he's not

3536.039 --> 3540.3190000000004
like wreaking in the prophets or

3537.76 --> 3540.3190000000004
anything at

3542.119 --> 3547.88
all

3545.039 --> 3550.119
psychics yeah there's no psychics

3547.88 --> 3554.28
involved in anything that he

3550.119 --> 3557.88
does and the healing just works it just

3554.28 --> 3557.88
works hey Akuma

3563.64 --> 3569.0789999999997
virus

3566.319 --> 3574.72
right I mean it's a rudol Steiner based

3569.079 --> 3574.7200000000003
technique and it works I use it all the

3575.119 --> 3580.319
time

3577.0 --> 3583.559
like because of that going through this

3580.319 --> 3585.0
is a lot better because in the past when

3583.559 --> 3587.96
I would go through this I would

3585.0 --> 3590.359
literally be out of my mind from it I

3587.96 --> 3593.16
would be like continually just trying to

3590.359 --> 3593.16
escape with my

3593.64 --> 3599.2799999999997
mind

3596.119 --> 3602.119
and I have managed to like not really do

3599.28 --> 3605.28
that and still kind of be myself thanks

3602.119 --> 3607.799
to the technique and the guidance is

3605.28 --> 3609.28
just I'm kind of like stuck in a surreal

3607.799 --> 3612.839
dilemma of

3609.28 --> 3616.039
absolutes where I don't know the the

3612.839 --> 3616.0389999999998
outcome with

3623.559 --> 3626.559

think I'm going to eat a t

3984.599 --> 3991.0
urine hope you guys don't mind too much

4113.44 --> 4120.678999999999
know long hair does like enhance your

4751.159 --> 4756.5599999999995
mean what do you guys would like what

4753.36 --> 4756.5599999999995
would you guys like to talk

4757.84 --> 4765.2390000000005
about I think I got like part of this

4760.92 --> 4768.52
stuff off my chest and I'd love to have

4765.239 --> 4772.879999999999
like more private conversations if

4768.52 --> 4772.88
anybody like wishes to inquire

4775.199 --> 4779.32
further dropping out of

4779.56 --> 4785.1990000000005
a how does that mean how does that even

4782.199 --> 4785.199
work

4786.679 --> 4793.84
skeptic I

4789.719 --> 4798.36
mean how do you drop out of it you don't

4793.84 --> 4800.28
really I mean maybe would talk less

4798.36 --> 4804.199
about Flat Earth I mean I don't really

4800.28 --> 4806.84
talk all that much about it either but I

4804.199 --> 4808.44
mean it's still like at least we know

4806.84 --> 4813.6
it's flat

4808.44 --> 4813.599999999999
and like we could address it

4819.12 --> 4824.08
right so what are you going to do with

4821.4 --> 4825.759999999999
all that time

4824.08 --> 4829.36
right if you're just too busy for it

4825.76 --> 4831.6
that's one thing that makes sense

4829.36 --> 4834.159
but I don't see how you're really going

4831.6 --> 4834.159000000001
to drop

4844.8 --> 4850.679
it and besides really 8 years nothing

4847.96 --> 4854.719
has really changed in what sense I think

4850.679 --> 4854.719
a lot has changed in8 years

4858.08 --> 4862.679
the understanding of it has changed

4881.639 --> 4884.639

report

5061.36 --> 5064.36
on

5101.119 --> 5107.36
crazy routes of thinking and all that

5103.88 --> 5110.1990000000005
and just never stop whining never stop

5107.36 --> 5112.799999999999
trolling all that to just get him away

5110.199 --> 5115.08
that's what what the Ballers have always

5112.8 --> 5115.08
really

5115.119 --> 5120.4
done and before they did it in the real

5118.08 --> 5122.679
world before social media and in social

5120.4 --> 5126.599999999999
media well they've done it again and

5122.679 --> 5129.719
just look at all these crazy baller

5126.6 --> 5129.719
channels out there

5134.48 --> 5138.839999999999
everywhere like it's all the rage I I

5137.84 --> 5141.6
think

5138.84 --> 5145.28
even I think just a lot of people are

5141.6 --> 5147.96
like surrendering to complete idiocy

5145.28 --> 5150.599999999999
like that probably because of the

5147.96 --> 5150.6
pressure in the

5151.28 --> 5158.759999999999
world it's like well the world's so bad

5154.32 --> 5161.84
we can't also give up on the globe

5158.76 --> 5164.320000000001
right like that would be too far that

5161.84 --> 5164.32
that type of

5166.6 --> 5171.320000000001
reasoning right so yeah I mean what did

5170.4 --> 5174.32
you

5171.32 --> 5177.759999999999
expect eventually it's just going

5174.32 --> 5181.28
to like people are just going to

5177.76 --> 5182.8
stop move on and then other newer people

5181.28 --> 5184.84
will pick it up

5182.8 --> 5185.719
they will just like hey look at all this

5184.84 --> 5188.28
old

5185.719 --> 5190.44
material this is really interesting and

5188.28 --> 5195.119
good arguments I'm going to use

5190.44 --> 5195.119
that and then it will just start

5198.56 --> 5203.2390000000005
again right there are new people that

5201.28 --> 5204.36
are kind of starting to figure out Flat

5203.239 --> 5208.599999999999
Earth

5204.36 --> 5208.599999999999
and like talking about

5211.199 --> 5214.199
it

5229.239 --> 5232.799999999999
moving out go so I'll be right

6001.56 --> 6006.719
C comments just

6003.88 --> 6010.159000000001
hang because they're getting so

6018.679 --> 6026.8

6040.0 --> 6046.44
with 60,000 views that that's good

or like useful information about

6050.04 --> 6052.92
anything

6053.159 --> 6058.719
that's just ridiculous I mean the guy is

6055.56 --> 6061.280000000001
literally like confessional debating

6058.719 --> 6061.28
like all the

[Music]

6169.76 --> 6172.76
m

6175.44 --> 6181.28
it's just like a lot of these trolls out

6177.719 --> 6184.04
there they only seem to care if a

6181.28 --> 6186.36
person that they perceive to be on their

6184.04 --> 6190.28
side of an

6186.36 --> 6191.28
argument has some success on YouTube on

6190.28 --> 6194.119
social

6191.28 --> 6196.84
media and

6194.119 --> 6199.159
that that's it not whether they even

6196.84 --> 6199.159000000001
make

6199.679 --> 6202.679
sense

6205.4 --> 6208.598999999999
I think a lot of the trolls that we deal

6207.04 --> 6211.4
with

6208.599 --> 6215.360000000001
like to them it's all just a bunch of

6211.4 --> 6215.36
peer pressure like that's all it

6220.36 --> 6225.239
is right I mean in the past people would

6222.679 --> 6228.639
say like oh look Sim Man Dan has more

6225.239 --> 6231.44
subscribers and I'm like

6228.639 --> 6234.400000000001
what but like every everything he talks

6231.44 --> 6234.4
about is completely

6237.28 --> 6243.92
useless like

6239.88 --> 6243.92
cheap very cheap

6245.679 --> 6251.679
information and yet he get pra gets

6247.96 --> 6254.119
phrases for that and that's just like

6251.679 --> 6256.0
why why do you think that that's

6254.119 --> 6257.719
perceived as good I mean even if you're

6256.0 --> 6258.719
not like a fanatical glob believer

6257.719 --> 6262.599
you're going to see that and you're

6258.719 --> 6262.599
going to be like this is

[Music]

6289.56 --> 6292.56

6298.04 --> 6301.96
gone did you all fall

6303.88 --> 6311.4400000000005
asleep I'm trying to wake up finally

6307.28 --> 6316.0
and like just get something rolling I

6311.44 --> 6316.0
think I got like a lot off my heart in

6319.48 --> 6324.08
ways

6321.639 --> 6327.76
but I do want to try to move on I mean

6324.08 --> 6327.76
we had like three hour shows and

6328.119 --> 6334.598999999999
everything remember

6330.76 --> 6336.8
that three hour shows non-stop talking

6334.599 --> 6339.360000000001
I'd love to go back to

6336.8 --> 6342.159000000001
that I have to get over my panic

6339.36 --> 6346.199
situation first

6342.159 --> 6348.92
though oh you got Skype back on right

6346.199 --> 6348.919999999999
thanks Richard

6349.48 --> 6352.48
G

6352.52 --> 6357.52
I would really appreciate it if a lot of

6354.84 --> 6362.599
you guys would actually contact me on

6357.52 --> 6362.599
Skype I would really really appreciate

6373.44 --> 6379.4
that so that I that that we can talk

6376.679 --> 6382.4
outside of the live

6379.4 --> 6382.4
shows

6388.0 --> 6394.92
and it is more handy than just using

6392.0 --> 6398.119
email which of course can

6394.92 --> 6401.84
work but yeah through Skype it's just

6398.119 --> 6401.839999999999
it's a bit easier to deal with

6409.4 --> 6412.4
it

6436.0 --> 6441.0
well Richard G that is like a slider

6438.44 --> 6444.36
that you are let an on and off

6441.0 --> 6447.32
switch in the settings that you could

6444.36 --> 6449.119
definitely activate and you probably

6447.32 --> 6451.28
have a deactivate just have to go into

6449.119 --> 6451.28
the

6469.32 --> 6472.32
settings

6477.92 --> 6483.32
can change your

6480.32 --> 6483.32
name

6485.96 --> 6491.76
uh pretty sure you should be able to do

6498.0 --> 6504.52
that right to just go to

6501.719 --> 6506.92
profile you can edit the picture of your

6504.52 --> 6509.8
profile and you can edit the name so I

6506.92 --> 6509.8
don't know what you're talking

6675.639 --> 6681.32
standards here for like how that has to

6679.239 --> 6682.638999999999
happen

6681.32 --> 6685.5599999999995
because like

6682.639 --> 6687.159000000001
yeah any animal for Slaughter like needs

6685.56 --> 6691.04

6687.159 --> 6691.04
calm and not stressed

6691.719 --> 6697.36

6694.44 --> 6702.04
release all these hormones and all

6697.36 --> 6706.119
that that will kind of like yeah make it

6702.04 --> 6706.119
less less Pleasant less

6708.96 --> 6711.96

6713.719 --> 6719.4

they do or I do at least

6926.84 --> 6931.639
waiting on some things to finalize

7022.76 --> 7029.159000000001
you thought it was only video calls no

7026.119 --> 7029.159
now that part came

7029.52 --> 7036.4400000000005
later it started out with the

7033.599 --> 7038.400000000001
chat the whole video call thing became

7036.44 --> 7040.119
like a function during

7038.4 --> 7042.36
the

7040.119 --> 7044.159
Google

7042.36 --> 7047.719

7044.159 --> 7047.719
era which is like

7048.8 --> 7055.4400000000005
20145 then Skype got gained like a video

7052.92 --> 7059.719
function and it didn't start out that

7055.44 --> 7062.879999999999
way it was just like a chat box program

7059.719 --> 7062.88
that's what it started out

7066.44 --> 7071.4
with I

7068.4 --> 7071.4
think

7073.32 --> 7078.0
not sure now maybe it did start out as a

7075.639 --> 7082.119
video call thing I don't know it's so

7078.0 --> 7082.119
long ago like 10 years

7086.199 --> 7090.4
ago wait that was MSN

7092.96 --> 7098.32
Messenger remember

7095.159 --> 7100.719
that from the

7098.32 --> 7102.32
90s

7100.719 --> 7106.04
yeah you might be right it might have

7102.32 --> 7109.32
actually started out as a video call

7106.04 --> 7111.76
system that then gained like more chat

7109.32 --> 7115.36
function yeah but I wasn't really all

7111.76 --> 7115.360000000001
into it when it was

7128.32 --> 7131.32

7158.239 --> 7161.239

7188.239 --> 7192.04
okay hot

7192.76 --> 7195.76
meal

7198.28 --> 7203.159
yeah no I didn't get a webcam or

7200.8 --> 7203.159000000001
anything

7203.76 --> 7207.639
until yeah nobody cares

7212.28 --> 7215.88
D this is just

7218.159 --> 7222.638999999999
weird

7219.92 --> 7225.36
but yeah I didn't touch a webcam until I

7222.639 --> 7227.599
got like this

7225.36 --> 7230.079
show that's the first time I started

7227.599 --> 7230.079
using a

7237.8 --> 7244.56
webcam I mean back then it's like video

7241.4 --> 7248.4
calling was kind of ridiculous because

7244.56 --> 7250.76
it would just cost you money to do that

7248.4 --> 7253.598999999999
like you really needed a strong internet

7250.76 --> 7256.2390000000005
connection and you had like call-in

7253.599 --> 7258.88
modems where you literally

7256.239 --> 7260.759999999999
like basically the internet was like

7258.88 --> 7264.599
talking over the

7260.76 --> 7264.599
phone so that cost

7264.719 --> 7269.28
money and you had to have a good

7266.599 --> 7271.84
bandwidth to like be even be able to

7269.28 --> 7273.96
transfer video sign signals and

7271.84 --> 7276.0

hey I'll get back to normal one

7877.159 --> 7881.0
not

7879.0 --> 7882.0
things like this tend to pass something

7881.0 --> 7884.199
triggered

7882.0 --> 7887.199
it

7884.199 --> 7887.199
right

7891.679 --> 7895.88
definitely a little buckers but totally

7894.04 --> 7899.48
worth yeah and then they grow

7895.88 --> 7901.76
up and then they want to like get out at

7899.48 --> 7906.199
6 o' in the morning

7901.76 --> 7910.159000000001
so yeah that's cute Richard G no thanks

7906.199 --> 7910.159

7965.559 --> 7973.0
emphasize again please contact me on

7969.48 --> 7973.0
Skype that would be

7976.4 --> 7981.879999999999
great right I mean especially if I'm

7979.0 --> 7984.48
like not going to stream for a while

7981.88 --> 7986.96
because I'm trying to recover then

7984.48 --> 7989.718999999999
skype's going to be the way where you

7986.96 --> 7989.719
can be

7996.96 --> 7999.96
updated

8002.36 --> 8007.759999999999
what cats are expensive are they're all

8005.079 --> 8007.759999999999
expensive

8007.96 --> 8014.44
right but I mean on average dogs do eat

8010.76 --> 8014.4400000000005
more unless they're like really

8026.96 --> 8029.96
small

8055.199 --> 8059.32
dog didn't to have more health issues oh

8057.199 --> 8063.44
I didn't even realize I that I

8059.32 --> 8063.44
guess depends on the breed

8071.52 --> 8079.0
though someone was presenting how we

8075.36 --> 8082.558999999999
know who our creator is and they put a

8079.0 --> 8086.159
CGI image of DNA at the

8082.559 --> 8086.159000000001
start yeah

8086.88 --> 8089.88
ridiculous

8095.28 --> 8100.159
DNA part of the be

8097.88 --> 8104.679
system

8100.159 --> 8107.44
uh it's only a model I mean they do

8104.679 --> 8110.4
something there are

8107.44 --> 8112.36
markers that seem to be very

8110.4 --> 8115.598999999999
specific but I

8112.36 --> 8118.079
mean like just like fingerprints are

8115.599 --> 8120.2390000000005
very unique and specific like that's

8118.079 --> 8123.239
that's all it really is that's all they

8120.239 --> 8123.239
really get out of the

8130.32 --> 8136.599
DNA like unless they like yeah I don't

8133.52 --> 8138.320000000001
know man they seem to claim to have no

8136.599 --> 8142.159000000001
like markers

8138.32 --> 8143.719
for abilities and all that that's what

8142.159 --> 8146.598999999999
they claim at

8143.719 --> 8148.8
least have no idea if that's actually

8146.599 --> 8151.4800000000005
completely true or just just correlator

8148.8 --> 8151.4800000000005
or something

8154.28 --> 8160.36
but there's definitely like suspicious

8157.599 --> 8160.360000000001
things about

8161.92 --> 8167.2390000000005
DNA like that model it is

8168.28 --> 8173.92
suspicious make a lot of claims yeah

8171.0 --> 8173.92
what else is new

8176.719 --> 8179.719

8206.679 --> 8209.679

8250.88 --> 8253.96
cats live a lot

8256.639 --> 8260.96
longer unless they get like parasites

8259.319 --> 8263.96
and

8260.96 --> 8266.358999999999
[ __ ] yeah indoor cats is not so healthy

8263.96 --> 8266.358999999999

I'm just dealing with neighbor

8386.439 --> 8389.439
cats

8411.56 --> 8415.519999999999
right I'm going to take a two-minute

8412.64 --> 8415.519999999999
break and be right

8416.359 --> 8419.359

I think the next

8531.12 --> 8539.160000000002
time what am I saying I think I think I

8534.399 --> 8539.16
should probably like try coffee again

8540.56 --> 8546.479
what do you guys think like I'm not sure

8542.84 --> 8549.64
though like I'm not handling cannabis at

8546.479 --> 8553.119999999999
all but I might be able to like use

8549.64 --> 8556.199999999999
coffee to like get a bit more active and

8553.12 --> 8559.28
loose what do you

8556.2 --> 8561.28
think maybe it's a bad idea I'm not sure

8559.28 --> 8563.76
I could like get trouble with my stomach

8561.28 --> 8563.76
from it

8566.16 --> 8569.16
perhaps

8572.96 --> 8578.8
I defin I would definitely need to be

8575.359 --> 8578.800000000001
eating something alongside

8588.52 --> 8593.720000000001
it

8590.6 --> 8595.24
what cat got bit by a rattlesnake and

8593.72 --> 8599.08
lived

8595.24 --> 8599.08
wow that's amazing

8605.8 --> 8609.019999999999
[Music]

8610.12 --> 8615.92
I don't know why that doesn't surprise

8611.8 --> 8615.92
you Richard G that does surprise

8620.64 --> 8625.92
me I mean a cat's a pretty small

8623.439 --> 8628.24
creature that that

8625.92 --> 8630.04
poisons yeah yeah I mean the smaller the

8628.24 --> 8632.439
creature the more impact the poison

8630.04 --> 8632.439
makes

8632.64 --> 8637.68
so that is kind of amazing that they

8635.2 --> 8637.68
survived

8638.12 --> 8642.960000000001
it it might also have been a complete

8640.68 --> 8645.56
[ __ ] story

8642.96 --> 8648.358999999999
though it does kind of seem a little bit

8645.56 --> 8648.359
like a nonsense

8648.399 --> 8653.88
story Ratt little snake would

8650.479 --> 8653.88
potentially just eat a

8655.279 --> 8659.0
cat they're big enough

8665.59 --> 8670.6
[Music]

8667.359 --> 8672.359
are you guys up for like another hour or

8670.6 --> 8674.0
something we've been gone for two hours

8672.359 --> 8676.439
and 22

8674.0 --> 8678.8
minutes but I'm thinking like maybe if I

8676.439 --> 8682.56
take a little like make a small cup of

8678.8 --> 8685.24
coffee then we could

8682.56 --> 8688.96
like get it going again and I might try

8685.24 --> 8688.96
it again tomorrow

8690.12 --> 8694.12
I mean coffee is not going to help when

8691.56 --> 8700.16
I'm like emotional or anything

8694.12 --> 8700.160000000002
but it might help me out of the the

8705.439 --> 8709.24
tiredness what do you guys

8715.88 --> 8718.88
think

8730.04 --> 8733.479000000001
okay Richard G I appreciate

8733.56 --> 8739.519999999999
that up to me okay okay well I will I I

8737.84 --> 8743.439
actually want

8739.52 --> 8746.68
to like I'm starting to kind of feel

8743.439 --> 8748.880000000001
better can't you tell like the way I'm I

8746.68 --> 8748.880000000001
talk

8749.6 --> 8754.439
I don't know

8751.04 --> 8757.160000000002
why so weird it's like I'm in this phase

8754.439 --> 8759.479000000001
and now I'm like kind of growing out of

8757.16 --> 8761.76
the phase I don't really understand why

8759.479 --> 8761.76
that's

8765.6 --> 8770.640000000001
happening maybe it's from the Illuminati

8768.64 --> 8772.8
C maybe it's from the

8770.64 --> 8775.8
eating it's just

8772.8 --> 8777.759999999998
that I've not been very

8775.8 --> 8781.519999999999
hungry

8777.76 --> 8783.800000000001
but then when I eat it does like help or

8781.52 --> 8786.6
something it's just that there doesn't

8783.8 --> 8788.96
seem to be a lot of incentive from my

8786.6 --> 8791.399000000001
body like like yeah you need to eat you

8788.96 --> 8796.919999999998
need to eat or like oh I want to eat now

8791.399 --> 8796.92
it's like no I'm full even though I'm

8799.76 --> 8807.16
hungry but actually then just eating

8802.76 --> 8809.880000000001
does help maybe maybe that is also

8807.16 --> 8815.68
correlating not smoking cannabis and I

8809.88 --> 8818.64
have had used cannabis to stimulate the

8815.68 --> 8822.6
appetite it's part of the reason I've

8818.64 --> 8822.599999999999
smoked smoked it for so

8825.84 --> 8832.64
long

8828.479 --> 8836.199999999999
like yeah that's just part of what it

8832.64 --> 8838.56
does right you know what I'll try it out

8836.2 --> 8840.399000000001
I'm going to make a little bit of coffee

8838.56 --> 8842.68

9941.479 --> 9947.08
AFK

9944.08 --> 9947.08
Jesus

9953.43 --> 9956.6
[Music]

9957.12 --> 9964.08
oops now you guys know what it feels

9961.16 --> 9967.479
like

9964.08 --> 9971.319
right that's the longest I've been a AFK

9967.479 --> 9974.0
during the live show ever

9971.319 --> 9977.0
[ __ ]

9974.0 --> 9977.0
h

9980.279 --> 9987.880000000001
all right anyway I got this coffee here

9984.04 --> 9987.880000000001
and let's see what that

9991.359 --> 9997.0
does so what have you been talking about

9994.72 --> 9997.0
in the

10001.56 --> 10005.68
meantime B Mary might have been a crisis

10004.52 --> 10008.68
actor

10005.68 --> 10008.68
what

10018.8 --> 10023.319
really yes blue P Evolution good

10027.92 --> 10036.84
point right because it's like Ballers

10032.16 --> 10038.24
tend to reason out like they're to win

10036.84 --> 10041.08
because the Earth is above so they're

10038.24 --> 10043.96
supposed to win so if there's some

10041.08 --> 10048.16
information that doesn't just give them

10043.96 --> 10048.16
a straight out win they find it

10049.96 --> 10056.56
suspicious so they're going to

10052.84 --> 10059.359
doubt the source it's like wait but this

10056.56 --> 10062.08
information kind of disproves the Bold

10059.359 --> 10063.84
which means it's probably misinformation

10062.08 --> 10065.8
so what's your Source right I mean

10063.84 --> 10068.2
that's the reasoning behind that that

10065.8 --> 10072.199999999999
mostly hello clutch welcome back good to

10068.2 --> 10072.2
see you glad you're still

10085.2 --> 10091.0
there it's like no you're really in

10087.72 --> 10095.08
check mate yes Richard G it's it is like

10091.0 --> 10098.76
that it's like no this is an outrage

10095.08 --> 10100.0
it's like but I was supposed to win like

10098.76 --> 10102.68
we made a

10100.0 --> 10105.76
deal we made a deal that I was supposed

10102.68 --> 10105.76
to win

10108.359 --> 10115.359
right cuz I'm the baller and it is a

10111.319 --> 10115.359
ball so I have to

10123.68 --> 10126.800000000001
win right

10127.24 --> 10134.96
right maybe we could like talk more

10131.04 --> 10134.960000000001
gossip more just about baller

10137.0 --> 10141.16
Behavior it'll be good distraction for

10140.2 --> 10145.880000000001
me

10141.16 --> 10145.88
too and the coffee might

10151.52 --> 10156.720000000001
actually might

10153.72 --> 10156.72
work

10158.92 --> 10161.64
blur

10177.279 --> 10187.0
pill cat's messing snakes

10181.0 --> 10190.0
up right now cats are dude cats catch

10187.0 --> 10193.92
mice

10190.0 --> 10198.6
so if you can catch a

10193.92 --> 10202.479
mouse you could basically face a snake

10198.6 --> 10202.479000000001
but I mean it's a pretty even match

10202.64 --> 10210.76
though snakes ate like hunt mice as well

10207.08 --> 10213.2
so they're pretty much both in in the

10210.76 --> 10216.92
same range I'd

10213.2 --> 10216.92
say when it comes the

10230.68 --> 10235.479000000001
quickness what what are you talking

10233.279 --> 10235.479000000001
about

10235.56 --> 10239.72
slow-mo oh right Bob

10243.64 --> 10246.64
Marley

10273.56 --> 10276.56
h

10301.8 --> 10306.56
an interesting Rabbit Hole really

10327.88 --> 10332.96
okay wait

10330.12 --> 10336.479000000001
what Bob Marley died at

10332.96 --> 10336.479
81 8

10337.04 --> 10340.880000000001
huh I never knew

10341.239 --> 10348.56
that I thought he was like still alive

10344.399 --> 10348.56
when I was growing up that's

10357.2 --> 10360.960000000001
weird that's really

10362.52 --> 10368.92
weird then again I didn't really really

10365.16 --> 10368.92
know back then

10389.96 --> 10398.72
so guys can you believe I was just like

10394.04 --> 10398.720000000001
8 18 minutes AFK during the live

10399.04 --> 10405.399000000001
show

10401.439 --> 10405.399
Ridiculous glad you're still here

10422.359 --> 10426.359
now oh okay

10453.279 --> 10456.279
oh

10458.33 --> 10461.35
[Music]

10495.8 --> 10499.869999999999
[Music]

10501.98 --> 10505.17
[Music]

10563.13 --> 10566.33
[Music]

10571.319 --> 10576.119999999999
I feel a lot

10573.12 --> 10576.12
better

10584.16 --> 10587.319
that coffee actually

10587.52 --> 10593.439
worked tomorrow I'm going to if I get up

10591.479 --> 10597.399
really early again I'm going to try that

10593.439 --> 10597.399
again except from the

10603.08 --> 10606.08
start

10606.8 --> 10609.239
all right

10609.399 --> 10612.399
also

10616.58 --> 10619.95
[Music]

10633.0 --> 10636.0
uh

10663.0 --> 10667.8
yeah

10664.52 --> 10670.800000000001
second in charge of the clinic slow-mo

10667.8 --> 10670.8
you got some creepy

10692.92 --> 10695.92
connections

10703.19 --> 10706.319000000001
[Music]

10710.35 --> 10713.389000000001
[Music]

10722.92 --> 10725.92
that

10732.46 --> 10737.979
[Music]

10745.29 --> 10748.349
[Music]

10750.63 --> 10754.83
[Music]

10752.84 --> 10759.309
e

10754.83 --> 10759.309
[Music]

10775.439 --> 10782.08
did I just get

10777.64 --> 10782.08
restored three hours into the

10782.84 --> 10785.84
show

10796.439 --> 10803.12
it literally feels like some kind of

10799.68 --> 10803.12
dark spell was just

10807.16 --> 10812.76
dispelled you could feel it Richard

10810.12 --> 10815.76
G I mean this is

10812.76 --> 10815.76
like

10816.0 --> 10819.319
really surprising to

10837.72 --> 10841.519999999999
me but you can feel

10842.72 --> 10845.72
it

10846.239 --> 10854.359
like my senses even feel different I'm

10849.96 --> 10854.358999999999
getting a bit like my coffee though

10855.279 --> 10858.92
is did I just

10859.239 --> 10862.96
laugh I'm actually

10865.96 --> 10868.96
laughing

10872.64 --> 10875.64
h

10875.72 --> 10880.88
am I

10877.16 --> 10880.88
free am I finally

10881.6 --> 10885.319
free is the curse

10888.479 --> 10894.88
lifted or maybe I'll

10891.6 --> 10898.0
get back in the hole later or something

10894.88 --> 10900.8
but I mean it just felt like a major

10898.0 --> 10903.479
transition all of a

10900.8 --> 10905.64
sudden like and I didn't expect that to

10903.479 --> 10905.64
have

10908.0 --> 10913.52
happened I've been like waiting for 3

10910.84 --> 10913.52
hours

10914.84 --> 10920.6
like

10916.96 --> 10926.319
hi let me try to find a subject to talk

10920.6 --> 10926.319
about and now it's like whoa I just woke

10932.56 --> 10935.56
up

10937.84 --> 10945.56
I'll affect you directly okay I hope

10942.399 --> 10945.56
what is Rin

10951.88 --> 10957.119999999999
like is Rage wi

10954.399 --> 10961.278999999999
dissonant or is it more

10957.12 --> 10964.12
arousing it's more arousing isn't

10961.279 --> 10966.399000000001
it you get excited by it

10964.12 --> 10968.720000000001
because it is kind it is I mean the

10966.399 --> 10973.08
nature of my rement is

10968.72 --> 10973.08
like it is like a call to

10974.359 --> 10980.960000000001
action it really is like of the same

10977.279 --> 10981.84
nature as like they symbolically Express

10980.96 --> 10986.199999999999
in

10981.84 --> 10991.319
like Dragon Ball Z where you're just

10986.2 --> 10992.479000000001
like it is that that frequency it's

10991.319 --> 10994.96
always like

10992.479 --> 10997.358999999999
that

10994.96 --> 10999.72
like I never try to be dissonant with my

10997.359 --> 11004.640000000001
rage when if I'm going to go rage it has

10999.72 --> 11007.239
to be like there has to be a just reason

11004.64 --> 11009.76
for it and then the way it comes out

11007.239 --> 11012.72
might be super OV

11009.76 --> 11015.16
exaggerated but there has to be a a just

11012.72 --> 11017.399
reason at the foundation of it holy [ __ ]

11015.16 --> 11020.72
I'm talking like fractal again all of a

11017.399 --> 11020.72
sudden what's

11022.479 --> 11025.479
happening

11030.2 --> 11032.720000000001
she

11034.76 --> 11040.279
know what

11036.56 --> 11043.239
happened did somebody just C Cast dispel

11040.279 --> 11043.239
Magic on me or

11052.399 --> 11055.399
something

11059.64 --> 11066.278999999999
hard to be around H okay fair fair

11063.12 --> 11069.479000000001
enough well I I really try to be

11066.279 --> 11073.640000000001
clerical blessing that's

11069.479 --> 11078.438999999998
nice I like the idea of

11073.64 --> 11078.439
that I I doubt it

11080.319 --> 11085.359
though I have snapped out of it yes

11086.2 --> 11092.08
I did like all of a sudden I think it's

11089.56 --> 11093.08
like talking to my roommate while I was

11092.08 --> 11097.16
making

11093.08 --> 11098.88
coffee like he was like really

11097.16 --> 11102.399
surprisingly

11098.88 --> 11106.08
insightful that guy is kind of

11102.399 --> 11108.519999999999
weird but like he

11106.08 --> 11111.359
is really

11108.52 --> 11114.92
intelligent in a way that is like not

11111.359 --> 11116.640000000001
super visible until you like communicate

11114.92 --> 11120.960000000001
with him and he shows

11116.64 --> 11120.96
it and like

11121.92 --> 11129.960000000001
yeah like

11125.08 --> 11133.239
somehow the way he like

11129.96 --> 11134.759999999998
responded like it something clicked

11133.239 --> 11138.08
really

11134.76 --> 11138.08
well it's

11142.279 --> 11145.279
weird

11156.04 --> 11161.359
uncontrolled you don't like yeah

11157.319 --> 11164.519999999999
uncontrolled sucks like when you rage

11161.359 --> 11168.279
when I do rage win you always have to

11164.52 --> 11172.279
have like an a goal that it is trying to

11168.279 --> 11174.68
achieve right if you're just raging

11172.279 --> 11178.0
because r

11174.68 --> 11182.720000000001
then the demon HS you out it does damage

11178.0 --> 11185.319
to you like actual blind rage is there

11182.72 --> 11188.319
to erase your

11185.319 --> 11191.96
feelings because your feelings hurt

11188.319 --> 11194.319
you and that is very damaging because

11191.96 --> 11197.479
that goes accompanied with self-hatred

11194.319 --> 11201.199999999999
and then you basically burn yourself out

11197.479 --> 11205.84
as you're doing it it's almost like you

11201.2 --> 11205.84
curse yourself or you violate your own

11206.239 --> 11210.479
spirit I had issues with that when I was

11209.52 --> 11213.640000000001
much

11210.479 --> 11217.358999999999
younger but I really learned to stop

11213.64 --> 11221.358999999999
doing that and to like eventually like

11217.359 --> 11224.359
be super specifically stoic about that

11221.359 --> 11226.239
part about my rage to the point where

11224.359 --> 11229.640000000001
people thought that I was

11226.239 --> 11231.52
like almost psychopath because I could I

11229.64 --> 11235.119999999999
could just like

11231.52 --> 11236.359
completely lock out all outrage like

11235.12 --> 11239.319000000001
about

11236.359 --> 11242.439
everything it was in a way how I

11239.319 --> 11245.359
regarded it me going into psychology

11242.439 --> 11247.239
mode it's like yeah there's some really

11245.359 --> 11249.640000000001
deranged people

11247.239 --> 11251.84
here I'm going to approach it like a

11249.64 --> 11255.68
psycholog like I was

11251.84 --> 11257.6
studying and I always do that I never

11255.68 --> 11261.800000000001
not do

11257.6 --> 11263.68
that like always and then eventually I

11261.8 --> 11266.88
kind of forget that that is what I'm

11263.68 --> 11270.16
doing but it still happens it's just my

11266.88 --> 11273.08
Consciousness is not really aware of it

11270.16 --> 11275.6
it's just something I do I just like

11273.08 --> 11278.16
yeah just Gathering spiritual metadata

11275.6 --> 11279.720000000001
I'm just figuring it out figuring out

11278.16 --> 11282.88
patterns figuring

11279.72 --> 11285.519999999999
out recognizable

11282.88 --> 11288.599999999999
issues and then my Consciousness often

11285.52 --> 11293.279
is like kind of like lost in all that

11288.6 --> 11295.640000000001
but after I then eventually snap back in

11293.279 --> 11297.960000000001
it's like Suddenly It's like yeah we got

11295.64 --> 11301.278999999999
a this whole plan I like yeah I got a

11297.96 --> 11302.96
giant profile here just stack of papers

11301.279 --> 11305.279
like oh you you didn't realize that you

11302.96 --> 11306.919999999998
were gathering that all this time Arwin

11305.279 --> 11310.84
yeah you were gathering that all that

11306.92 --> 11314.84
time now you're finally realizing it

11310.84 --> 11317.76
that's how I work it's like everything

11314.84 --> 11317.76
including you

11317.8 --> 11324.84
guys like I I've been studying you and

11322.12 --> 11328.04
everybody so don't worry worry about it

11324.84 --> 11330.16
it's just that I pay extra attention not

11328.04 --> 11333.2
just to the individual and like how to

11330.16 --> 11334.56
respond and all that but also like how

11333.2 --> 11337.479000000001
do you

11334.56 --> 11340.199999999999
work what's the percentage of like

11337.479 --> 11343.278999999999
likeness of somebody

11340.2 --> 11347.279
else and how is it

11343.279 --> 11351.439
different and are there more very

11347.279 --> 11353.800000000001
specific typical details that come with

11351.439 --> 11356.479000000001
that setting

11353.8 --> 11356.479
yeah it's

11357.359 --> 11361.56
getting

11359.0 --> 11363.16
complicated man I'm I'm subtly in the

11361.56 --> 11366.08
flow

11363.16 --> 11368.399
man must be the coffee not just the

11366.08 --> 11371.2
coffee though but it it certainly helped

11368.399 --> 11375.16
and I it didn't make me sick or

11371.2 --> 11380.640000000001
anything cuz coffee was making me

11375.16 --> 11380.64
sick a while back that's why I

11381.92 --> 11384.92
quited

11403.0 --> 11409.2
H struggled with it what with your

11405.96 --> 11409.199999999999
sensitivity or with

11411.84 --> 11414.84
rage

11418.279 --> 11422.6
because I mean yeah the sensitivity it

11420.12 --> 11425.12
just makes you like a canary in a coal

11422.6 --> 11426.68
mine it's like you're always like

11425.12 --> 11429.160000000002
everybody's just going their business

11426.68 --> 11429.16
and you're

11429.399 --> 11434.76
like like you just feel everything

11432.52 --> 11435.68
really and you're like whoa there's

11434.76 --> 11437.52
something happening here there's

11435.68 --> 11438.960000000001
something happening there I know exactly

11437.52 --> 11444.640000000001
what that's

11438.96 --> 11447.399
like with me I don't really

11444.64 --> 11452.68
I don't get slapped around about it as

11447.399 --> 11455.0
much because now I have so much I do

11452.68 --> 11456.56
with the details of that type of

11455.0 --> 11459.279
information

11456.56 --> 11460.8
right like I'm actually actively

11459.279 --> 11463.239
Gathering it

11460.8 --> 11466.08
now to

11463.239 --> 11468.239
study Gathering spiritual metadata as I

11466.08 --> 11468.239
call

11471.16 --> 11475.68
it dude maybe I should just start a new

11475.96 --> 11478.96
show

11482.319 --> 11487.56
nah I just keep going it's weird it's

11485.0 --> 11489.88
awkward but I mean it's kind of

11487.56 --> 11492.68
funny how many people are actually going

11489.88 --> 11494.679999999998
to try to watch all the three hours and

11492.68 --> 11497.76
just not even know that at the end it

11494.68 --> 11497.76
was like way

11501.76 --> 11510.04
better it's like yeah man Big Show it

11505.84 --> 11510.04
really starts to get good after three

11513.56 --> 11519.08
hours it was Road ra road rage win oh

11517.72 --> 11522.319
dear the moon

11519.08 --> 11525.6
buggy I've never had a road

11522.319 --> 11528.479
rage but I have always treated the road

11525.6 --> 11528.479000000001
like it's a race

11530.319 --> 11537.72
course and by the way never ever an

11534.84 --> 11539.92
accident not one time even when I should

11537.72 --> 11544.239
have because other people would were

11539.92 --> 11546.6
causing the accident it's like no I can

11544.239 --> 11549.199999999999
tell ahead of time when somebody's going

11546.6 --> 11551.16
to be in an accident on the road it's I

11549.2 --> 11553.68
have that extra sense it's almost like

11551.16 --> 11556.92
the physician like they T remember in

11553.68 --> 11558.800000000001
the movie I have only watched half of it

11556.92 --> 11560.04
but they like the guy is touching

11558.8 --> 11563.438999999998
somebody and then

11560.04 --> 11565.880000000001
like they suddenly know they're going to

11563.439 --> 11568.92
die or what's going to happen right I

11565.88 --> 11573.479
have that on the road I can just tell

11568.92 --> 11579.08
like o that person's not paying

11573.479 --> 11582.278999999999
attention or like I just like

11579.08 --> 11586.52
okay that that guy is going to be in an

11582.279 --> 11590.239
accident and then like a few minutes

11586.52 --> 11592.16
later the the the road just slows down

11590.239 --> 11594.68
and you literally see the car upside

11592.16 --> 11598.64
down at the side of the road I've I've

11594.68 --> 11601.64
had that I've experienced that

11598.64 --> 11601.64
happened

11601.8 --> 11604.8
200

11605.08 --> 11611.88
12 pretty

11607.52 --> 11615.6
special but like I know when something

11611.88 --> 11618.239
dangerous is going to happen around me

11615.6 --> 11619.960000000001
and I know what to do to prevent getting

11618.239 --> 11622.92
caught up in

11619.96 --> 11626.679999999998
it like ahead of time and that's why

11622.92 --> 11629.960000000001
I've never ever like not one time had an

11626.68 --> 11633.720000000001
accident in a car cuz I just get this

11629.96 --> 11636.239
weird ahead of time Spider Sense

11633.72 --> 11638.76
thing just like I know something's going

11636.239 --> 11641.319
to happen I can feel it

11638.76 --> 11644.56
coming it's like what's going to cause

11641.319 --> 11646.199999999999
it what's going to cause it ah there

11644.56 --> 11648.319
that has the frequency that's what I

11646.2 --> 11652.800000000001
picked up okay how am I going to deal

11648.319 --> 11656.039999999999
with this slow down or like speed up up

11652.8 --> 11658.599999999999
or take a side road or something go to

11656.04 --> 11663.76
the parking

11658.6 --> 11663.76
lot right never had road rage

11679.56 --> 11684.16
though I always know when a deer was is

11682.56 --> 11685.359
going to jump in front of you yeah I

11684.16 --> 11689.6
can't believe

11685.359 --> 11689.6
that you can feel those kind of things

11693.04 --> 11699.92
coming flip my phone

11695.92 --> 11702.68
o yeah freezing freezing fog can be

11699.92 --> 11702.68
extremely

11703.76 --> 11707.12
deceptive in a

11709.56 --> 11714.16
car it's like oh yeah I'll just go

11712.2 --> 11716.239000000001
through that and then like oh [ __ ]

11714.16 --> 11720.359
suddenly everything is

11716.239 --> 11720.359
icy like including your

11741.399 --> 11744.399
car

11750.92 --> 11756.359
pickup doesn't do well

11753.199 --> 11759.52
yeah yeah higher the higher suspended

11756.359 --> 11763.04
the car the more difficult to deal with

11759.52 --> 11763.04
slippery situations

11771.319 --> 11774.319
yep

11801.279 --> 11804.279
for

11809.67 --> 11812.819
[Music]

11831.199 --> 11834.199
for

11839.22 --> 11844.16
[Music]

11840.8 --> 11844.16
okay that was

11853.239 --> 11856.96
weird bad grammar

11861.199 --> 11864.199
alert

11873.399 --> 11878.399
what are you talking about it is it's

11876.359 --> 11883.56
you spelled it

11878.399 --> 11885.76
right right it's is a short of it is it

11883.56 --> 11887.64
used it's exactly like that you spelled

11885.76 --> 11890.52
it

11887.64 --> 11894.119999999999
right everybody always leaves those

11890.52 --> 11894.12
things out of it but it's very important

11896.56 --> 11904.119999999999
actually like I always make effort to do

11900.479 --> 11906.64
that but then again I take pride in like

11904.12 --> 11909.160000000002
taking my English

11906.64 --> 11912.358999999999
serious when I write it down or when I

11909.16 --> 11915.319
speak it as long as I'm in the flow that

11912.359 --> 11916.439
is I mean first three hours of this show

11915.319 --> 11920.198999999999
it was just

11916.439 --> 11920.199
like like I don't really

11921.12 --> 11925.0
care

11923.56 --> 11928.88
that's

11925.0 --> 11932.64
right apostrophe that's

11928.88 --> 11934.88
right but I mean there is no its without

11932.64 --> 11934.88
the

11940.479 --> 11945.319
apostrophe there is no word that is

11949.56 --> 11955.6
that unless there's an object or

11952.64 --> 11958.239
something that's called an its I've

11955.6 --> 11958.239
never heard of

11965.14 --> 11968.289999999999
[Music]

11973.08 --> 11977.64
that it is

11981.04 --> 11986.0
possessive

11983.0 --> 11986.0
oh

11986.52 --> 11991.439
wait really isn't that just the

11993.12 --> 11999.439
same

11996.0 --> 12002.359
it's but instead of its you can usually

11999.439 --> 12002.359
usually say

12008.76 --> 12016.279
there journalism AG in one point okay I

12012.279 --> 12019.08
nobody no nobody ever that I've heard of

12016.279 --> 12021.239
nobody in my fi ever use its as a

12019.08 --> 12023.399
possessive

12021.239 --> 12025.96
form

12023.399 --> 12028.439
although I mean in astrophysics they'll

12025.96 --> 12033.438999999998
probably use it a

12028.439 --> 12033.439
lot like it's gravitational

12035.96 --> 12040.919999999998
pool the gravitational pool of the black

12039.16 --> 12043.92
hole

12040.92 --> 12043.92
it's

12044.96 --> 12050.319
I was never really aware though that

12047.04 --> 12050.319000000001
that doesn't use an

12070.84 --> 12073.84
apostrophe

12098.239 --> 12105.039999999999
all right anyway I hope you guys are

12099.56 --> 12105.039999999999
having a swell time in these last 20

12105.279 --> 12112.0
minutes grammar can be harder than

12108.56 --> 12114.64
math I don't know I don't maybe

12112.0 --> 12116.239
technically probably

12114.64 --> 12120.439
yes

12116.239 --> 12122.8
but I poured myself out on the

12120.439 --> 12126.12
grammar and not the

12122.8 --> 12130.039999999999
math it's basically like in school when

12126.12 --> 12133.479000000001
it was like 16 17 I just like realized

12130.04 --> 12137.439
like like I hate French class I hate

12133.479 --> 12140.278999999999
German class but I love English and I I

12137.439 --> 12141.64
really want to pay attention at Dutch

12140.279 --> 12145.199
and it's

12141.64 --> 12149.08
like yeah I want to like get through

12145.199 --> 12151.68
math I wanted the math but as like got

12149.08 --> 12152.22
nearer to like the exam class it was

12151.68 --> 12154.199
just

12152.22 --> 12157.56
[Music]

12154.199 --> 12161.439
like I was losing interest I was like

12157.56 --> 12163.239
starting to see like this is not really

12161.439 --> 12166.359
what I'm I'm looking for like these are

12163.239 --> 12168.399
not the skills I'm looking for but I

12166.359 --> 12171.16
just noticed like the further I got into

12168.399 --> 12173.0
school like the more I actually realized

12171.16 --> 12175.439
like the use of

12173.0 --> 12178.319
language I wonder sometimes what would

12175.439 --> 12182.279
happen if I actually chose a language

12178.319 --> 12182.278999999999
package oriented instead

12182.6 --> 12189.720000000001
of

12185.319 --> 12189.72
yeah math and physics and all

12190.68 --> 12193.68
that

12194.6 --> 12198.76
would have loved to have German instead

12196.52 --> 12198.76
of

12203.36 --> 12206.899000000001
[Music]

12208.279 --> 12211.479000000001
French I

12220.68 --> 12223.68
guess

12227.6 --> 12230.76
being bilingual very beneficial in the

12229.8 --> 12234.64
job

12230.76 --> 12238.12
market yeah well I put it in

12234.64 --> 12239.64
my resume it's like one of the things I

12238.12 --> 12241.199
put in my resume and that I can

12239.64 --> 12243.119999999999
immediately

12241.199 --> 12246.239000000001
demonstrate it's like oh you want to

12243.12 --> 12249.76
talk English or

12246.239 --> 12251.84
you like just no problem I can like

12249.76 --> 12256.12
switch back and forth back and forth

12251.84 --> 12258.52
just like that like I am really good at

12256.12 --> 12258.52
doing

12263.479 --> 12270.198999999999
that like technically two people could

12267.84 --> 12272.52
like keep asking me questions one would

12270.199 --> 12275.52
ask in Dutch and the other in English

12272.52 --> 12277.640000000001
and I would be like basically

12275.52 --> 12280.84
simultaneously be able to address both

12277.64 --> 12283.358999999999
of them in their respective languages I

12280.84 --> 12286.239
can't do that

12283.359 --> 12286.239
cuz I'm good at

12290.239 --> 12297.08
it right and I mean it's just two

12293.0 --> 12300.04
languages it's not like oh wow are we oh

12297.08 --> 12301.199
the lingle genius yeah with two

12300.04 --> 12303.52
languages

12301.199 --> 12306.720000000001
though that's

12303.52 --> 12310.479000000001
it I just knew I want to become really

12306.72 --> 12315.56
good at English I just that's the one I

12310.479 --> 12315.56
want I knew it when I was 6 years

12340.479 --> 12343.479
old

12370.399 --> 12373.399
for

12390.16 --> 12397.52
H yeah well Richard G like I wasn't from

12393.239 --> 12400.72
a bilingual family either I mean my

12397.52 --> 12404.279
dad's not that good at English and my

12400.72 --> 12408.519999999999
mom was proficient but not that good at

12404.279 --> 12409.640000000001
English I was like the language person

12408.52 --> 12412.76
from my

12409.64 --> 12416.278999999999
family like my parents especially my

12412.76 --> 12420.960000000001
mother was very focused on music that

12416.279 --> 12420.960000000001
somehow didn't really catch on all that

12421.8 --> 12429.239
much but language

12424.479 --> 12432.92
did I was just I enjoy music but I'm I

12429.239 --> 12435.96
was really impressed by the power of

12432.92 --> 12437.960000000001
language like more than by the power of

12435.96 --> 12442.16
music even though there is just some

12437.96 --> 12447.119999999999
music that is like very magical very

12442.16 --> 12447.119999999999
inspiring but I was never

12447.6 --> 12452.800000000001
really I always felt like that power

12450.279 --> 12455.76
just wasn't

12452.8 --> 12458.438999999998
mine I still remember like how when I

12455.76 --> 12462.0
was a very little kid my mom tried to

12458.439 --> 12464.880000000001
teach me to play piano and I was so so

12462.0 --> 12467.12
overwhelmed by like the sound of the

12464.88 --> 12469.839999999998
piano that I

12467.12 --> 12472.560000000001
literally had a panic attack over I was

12469.84 --> 12474.76
afraid of it it's like I was afraid of

12472.56 --> 12477.8
the power of a

12474.76 --> 12480.56
piano like I only wanted to listen to it

12477.8 --> 12483.519999999999
at a distance I didn't even want to be

12480.56 --> 12487.16
too close to it because it's like it

12483.52 --> 12487.16
just it was too

12487.92 --> 12494.439
impressive kind of odd thinking back to

12491.56 --> 12499.278999999999
that like I didn't play piano because it

12494.439 --> 12499.279
was too overwhelming for me it's

12520.199 --> 12523.199
weird

12527.68 --> 12533.04
right but I definitely knew I wanted

12530.0 --> 12538.08
English that's why English had the

12533.04 --> 12540.0
highest score in my exams at a

12538.08 --> 12543.16
nine is it

12540.0 --> 12548.439
9.2 a nine on my

12543.16 --> 12548.439
English on the exam I mean

12548.92 --> 12553.12
yeah it's very serious about it

12555.199 --> 12560.800000000001
but it's also because like in my entire

12557.8 --> 12564.56
class I was the only one that would like

12560.8 --> 12567.519999999999
understand all these modes of speaking

12564.56 --> 12570.88
like just the way English Works how the

12567.52 --> 12573.880000000001
sayings work all that I just had a

12570.88 --> 12575.839999999998
really good feel for it very early on

12573.88 --> 12578.88
well others were just still trying to

12575.84 --> 12581.92
struggle just translating everything to

12578.88 --> 12585.319
English me literally

12581.92 --> 12585.319
which is you end up with like

12586.12 --> 12592.0
a Dutch in English words basically it's

12590.04 --> 12594.6
not that impressive but I could just

12592.0 --> 12597.8
like actually talk English and

12594.6 --> 12603.279
American like really make it feel like

12597.8 --> 12606.479
it was that language by the way you uh

12603.279 --> 12606.479000000001
assemble the

12610.04 --> 12613.04
sentence

12615.12 --> 12619.880000000001
and that's why I got a nine on it on it

12617.239 --> 12623.56
on my exam so

12619.88 --> 12623.56
yeah that's just my

12640.04 --> 12643.04
thing

12645.68 --> 12650.800000000001
anybody still

12647.12 --> 12652.84
watching only got 15 watching a lot of

12650.8 --> 12656.239
people probably hooked off at the first

12652.84 --> 12656.239
three hours I wouldn't blame

12656.56 --> 12661.0
you but please do come

12669.96 --> 12672.96
back

12694.439 --> 12699.0
Sumer course and grammar just to get it

12696.479 --> 12701.479
down better well that's very admirable L

12699.0 --> 12705.08
evolution is never bad

12701.479 --> 12709.519999999999
like better language is always good like

12705.08 --> 12710.8
you'll never it'll never be outdated as

12709.52 --> 12713.92
a skill

12710.8 --> 12716.72
upgrade you know so it's always good to

12713.92 --> 12719.84
be a little bit better at language if

12716.72 --> 12721.319
you feel like you have a yeah you're

12719.84 --> 12725.56
behind or something or you're not as

12721.319 --> 12725.56
good as you could be always

12727.72 --> 12732.96
good I was very solemn there for yeah

12731.04 --> 12735.359
while three freaking hours I mean this

12732.96 --> 12737.278999999999
is like the craziest show setup that

12735.359 --> 12743.279
I've had in a

12737.279 --> 12749.960000000001
while like three hours of just I bro

12743.279 --> 12753.12
I basically cried on there was quite

12749.96 --> 12756.519999999999
desperate and then it just like got

12753.12 --> 12760.08
tired then I got my coffee and suddenly

12756.52 --> 12762.08
it's like whoo just like the curse was

12760.08 --> 12765.399
just lifted

12762.08 --> 12769.76
I mean it almost felt like uh the king

12765.399 --> 12769.76
of Rohan right just sitting

12771.0 --> 12779.68
there and then just like the spell is

12774.319 --> 12783.72
lifted and then just huh whoa where am

12779.68 --> 12785.68
I it felt like that it was it that's why

12783.72 --> 12788.64
I said like what the hell did a curse

12785.68 --> 12790.880000000001
just lift because it just suddenly like

12788.64 --> 12792.519999999999
it was happening while I was already

12790.88 --> 12795.479
sitting here it's just I didn't expect

12792.52 --> 12795.479000000001
it and suddenly it was

12796.439 --> 12799.76
like it's

12817.12 --> 12823.76
gone oh you're writing for the school

12819.399 --> 12823.76
paper right makes sense we

12831.92 --> 12838.359
go but it's so funny because now that

12835.04 --> 12841.960000000001
that curse is lifted now suddenly I

12838.359 --> 12843.880000000001
like remember all these things like like

12841.96 --> 12847.198999999999
hell yeah I really like

12843.88 --> 12849.0
language just talk about it oh yeah I

12847.199 --> 12851.560000000001
have this intuition like how to prevent

12849.0 --> 12853.88
accidents like talk about it it's like

12851.56 --> 12855.479
all these things just come presenting

12853.88 --> 12857.96
themselves

12855.479 --> 12860.599999999999
again the first 3 hours it was just

12857.96 --> 12862.64
there was nothing presenting itself

12860.6 --> 12865.960000000001
right because that's kind of how it is

12862.64 --> 12865.96
it's like from underneath it

12866.68 --> 12871.76
just all these subjects like oh yeah I

12869.6 --> 12874.279
could I could say a a bunch about that

12871.76 --> 12875.92
oh yeah I could say a bunch about that

12874.279 --> 12878.319000000001
but when you're not in the flow that

12875.92 --> 12881.199
doesn't happen so it's just you're like

12878.319 --> 12884.439
when is something going to pop up right

12881.199 --> 12886.640000000001
where is it like please I want to talk

12884.439 --> 12888.68
about something and then if it doesn't

12886.64 --> 12892.278999999999
happen I basically start pulling at you

12888.68 --> 12895.68
guys like hey ask a question damn

12892.279 --> 12901.0
it it's because it's not presenting

12895.68 --> 12901.0
itself to me because I'm not in the

12909.6 --> 12912.6
flow

12939.6 --> 12942.6
for

12953.24 --> 12962.94
[Music]

12969.52 --> 12972.52
I

12984.439 --> 12994.12
right we're at 3 hours 33 minutes and

12988.399 --> 12998.08
yeah yeah 33 seconds

12994.12 --> 13002.68
oo that's a lot of Threes the only way

12998.08 --> 13005.76
to get more threes is i' stream 33 hours

13002.68 --> 13007.960000000001
33 minutes and 33 seconds but that's not

13005.76 --> 13009.960000000001
going to

13007.96 --> 13013.438999999998
happen like

13009.96 --> 13016.72
ever definitely not going to do a 33

13013.439 --> 13018.92
hour stream ever don't want to don't

13016.72 --> 13018.92
need

13025.399 --> 13030.0
to right but I do feel restored I'm

13028.359 --> 13032.04
going to try to hold on to this and

13030.0 --> 13035.199
maybe tomorrow it'll be just a way

13032.04 --> 13037.76
better show than the first three hours

13035.199 --> 13037.76
of today's

13059.399 --> 13062.399
show

13064.64 --> 13071.72
right so yeah I might just round out the

13069.239 --> 13074.56
show unless you guys wanted to continue

13071.72 --> 13078.8
talking if you have some other thing you

13074.56 --> 13078.8
might want to have me talk

13079.279 --> 13085.04
about I mean the language is kind of

13082.6 --> 13088.04
depleted as a subject right

13085.04 --> 13088.04
now

13089.319 --> 13092.319
right

13099.399 --> 13106.92
better not be an agent an agent of

13103.08 --> 13110.479
what the Masonic numbers come up often

13106.92 --> 13115.359
here yeah I know

13110.479 --> 13118.438999999998
like 4 F of all my

13115.359 --> 13121.04
shows like total duration which I

13118.439 --> 13123.960000000001
literally cannot time with OBS because

13121.04 --> 13127.84
it adds a whole bunch adds up the

13123.96 --> 13131.519999999999
freaking some kind of 33 in there

13127.84 --> 13131.52
somewhere or it's like

13131.92 --> 13138.319
33

13134.76 --> 13139.479
444 that kind of thing like it happens

13138.319 --> 13142.399
all the

13139.479 --> 13143.84
time and it's even like I can't even aim

13142.399 --> 13146.198999999999
for it it's like yeah okay I'm going to

13143.84 --> 13148.04
round out at 3 hours and 20 minutes

13146.199 --> 13151.359
right it's like yeah okay whatever I'm

13148.04 --> 13153.359
running out and then when it's done

13151.359 --> 13154.92
I come back like an hour later to check

13153.359 --> 13158.319
like how long the video was and it's

13154.92 --> 13161.52
literally 3 hours and 33 minutes this

13158.319 --> 13165.439
like I didn't even know that it just it

13161.52 --> 13165.439
just happens it's

13171.64 --> 13176.399
weird but I mean I already got 33 my

13174.56 --> 13180.239
email and everything so I'm just fully

13176.399 --> 13183.319
surrendering to the 33 stuff I am like I

13180.239 --> 13183.319
I am one with the

13194.279 --> 13200.84
33 right and it's not Masonic I am not

13197.8 --> 13204.96
part of a masonic

13200.84 --> 13209.0
anything but I do sort of sympathize and

13204.96 --> 13210.839999999998
I I almost did become like a Mason it's

13209.0 --> 13212.84
just that

13210.84 --> 13215.880000000001
would be horrible to see Arwin in Room

13212.84 --> 13220.279
101 oh really blue pill Evolution did

13215.88 --> 13223.039999999999
you know that my mother's old address of

13220.279 --> 13226.359
the house where I live most of my life

13223.04 --> 13229.359
was literally called Queen

13226.359 --> 13229.359
Lane

13234.439 --> 13241.399
101 so yeah I got something with 101 as

13239.12 --> 13246.08
well

13241.399 --> 13246.08
and it sounds a lot more eloquent in

13247.08 --> 13250.96
Dutch you don't understand the

13251.6 --> 13258.92
101 uh well Room 101 is like a horror

13256.96 --> 13261.679999999998
movie where you go in the room and you

13258.92 --> 13263.68
can't get out no matter what you do like

13261.68 --> 13265.84
you literally try to crawl out of the

13263.68 --> 13269.12
window and then literally there's

13265.84 --> 13271.439
nowhere to crawl to but back on the

13269.12 --> 13274.359
ridge of the building it's it's freaky

13271.439 --> 13278.68
the movie is freaking creepy or was is

13274.359 --> 13281.68
that 101 is that 308 I don't remember

13278.68 --> 13281.68
that

13290.399 --> 13295.039999999999
whatever it's also in the book

13295.12 --> 13300.68
1984 they to Winston oh okay I didn't

13297.84 --> 13304.279
know that I really don't don't like that

13300.68 --> 13308.319
book I I despise

13304.279 --> 13313.04
it I read Brave New World instead I had

13308.319 --> 13317.479
a choice because 1984 is so unbelievably

13313.04 --> 13320.319000000001
uncomfortable to me like I genuine like

13317.479 --> 13324.96
it it it turns on my Rin I is like I

13320.319 --> 13327.92
want to burn that I want to burn like I

13324.96 --> 13331.08
don't want to burn it because it's so

13327.92 --> 13334.92
helpful to understand ter it's just that

13331.08 --> 13337.0
it's so piled on in there I just hate it

13334.92 --> 13340.64
I just hate it with

13337.0 --> 13345.239
every fiber of my body with

13340.64 --> 13348.72
every aspect of my spirit I hate

13345.239 --> 13351.6
9084 I hate it I hate everything about

13348.72 --> 13354.64
it it's so horrendous it just makes me

13351.6 --> 13357.6
want to like just blow it all up just

13354.64 --> 13359.92
burn everything like that it is like

13357.6 --> 13362.399000000001
that I makes me want to burn Absolut

13359.92 --> 13362.399
absolutely

13363.76 --> 13369.72
everything it held up pretty great it

13366.199 --> 13374.52
does because yeah I mean they used it as

13369.72 --> 13377.72
an instruction manual right they did in

13374.52 --> 13381.92
many ways the psychological tactics that

13377.72 --> 13384.519999999999
are like very pronounced in there have

13381.92 --> 13387.68
been

13384.52 --> 13387.68
applied they

13387.96 --> 13391.88
do I just hate it

13393.479 --> 13397.159
yeah lill it

13410.199 --> 13418.880000000001
is like I watched the movie one from the

13415.159 --> 13421.399
is it the 80s or '90s

13418.88 --> 13423.679999999998
version I watched that movie and its

13421.399 --> 13426.599999999999
whole was like really good

13423.68 --> 13428.279
actors and that just the movie Just

13426.6 --> 13433.279
terrified the [ __ ] out of

13428.279 --> 13435.359
me like it's just 9084 is just really

13433.279 --> 13440.279
really

13435.359 --> 13440.279
terrible it's like the antithesis of

13442.239 --> 13448.319
me like just reading about it makes me

13445.319 --> 13451.359
extremely uncomfortable about the things

13448.319 --> 13453.159
that they do in there it's like

13451.359 --> 13456.279
yeah I hate

13453.159 --> 13458.6
it like Brave New World I read that and

13456.279 --> 13461.880000000001
I thought it was really interesting and

13458.6 --> 13465.68
like compelling like they act it

13461.88 --> 13469.438999999998
actually like they made a case and it's

13465.68 --> 13472.239
like I can't say it's completely

13469.439 --> 13474.68
unreasonable because they had the

13472.239 --> 13476.88
exception right I don't remember the the

13474.68 --> 13478.56
terminologies they use in the book but

13476.88 --> 13480.56
they had like the whole thing breeding

13478.56 --> 13481.88
it and the freaking condition which is

13480.56 --> 13485.88
creepy as

13481.88 --> 13487.88
hell [ __ ] free sex and all that and at

13485.88 --> 13491.599999999999
first I was like yeah that sounds

13487.88 --> 13495.119999999999
awesome being a teen really wanting sex

13491.6 --> 13497.12
and all that but then afterward I

13495.12 --> 13499.04
realized like oh yeah but they also have

13497.12 --> 13501.159000000001
the people that don't want to join that

13499.04 --> 13505.439
do natural

13501.159 --> 13507.159
births and like they just live kind of a

13505.439 --> 13508.68
poor

13507.159 --> 13511.359
life

13508.68 --> 13515.439
just in the corner over

13511.359 --> 13520.84
there and that is like the real thing

13515.439 --> 13520.84
like that makes it

13521.12 --> 13528.0
feasible because they kept the

13525.279 --> 13532.800000000001
exception like there must be something

13528.0 --> 13535.72
you can flee to or it will blow up if

13532.8 --> 13539.319
you're literally forced no matter where

13535.72 --> 13540.599999999999
you go to become partic participant in

13539.319 --> 13542.8
everything

13540.6 --> 13544.68
it's going to blow up it's going to

13542.8 --> 13546.599999999999
suddenly flip its side out and then

13544.68 --> 13550.52
everything is going to be destroyed but

13546.6 --> 13553.359
in Brave New World they had the opt

13550.52 --> 13555.04
out you could just opt out you could

13553.359 --> 13558.319
just like okay I don't want to be part

13555.04 --> 13561.68
of this anymore I'm going to go to

13558.319 --> 13561.68
the to The

13561.92 --> 13568.12
Outlanders and live with them like and

13565.439 --> 13571.159
that made it really feasible like that

13568.12 --> 13574.479000000001
made it like this could be real this

13571.159 --> 13574.479
could actually become

13577.399 --> 13582.439
real end of life hospitals yeah but we

13580.64 --> 13583.8
already got that one from like soil and

13582.439 --> 13586.239
green and

13583.8 --> 13587.479
everything I mean soil and green really

13586.239 --> 13590.72
showed

13587.479 --> 13590.72
that like

13598.6 --> 13601.6
shocking

13602.88 --> 13608.319
you don't remember the op out

13605.04 --> 13611.84
part well it's not literally an opt out

13608.319 --> 13614.68
it's just that some people want don't

13611.84 --> 13617.319
want any part of the society they don't

13614.68 --> 13619.92
want so they don't want anything and

13617.319 --> 13622.479
then they can go like to the

13619.92 --> 13625.68
hills and they like basically live in

13622.479 --> 13628.519999999999
huts and old Caravans and

13625.68 --> 13631.52
[ __ ] and they're left

13628.52 --> 13631.52
alone

13631.76 --> 13635.08
it's like at the

13636.68 --> 13643.359
end and like the main character from the

13639.52 --> 13646.239
book goes there like he realizes like I

13643.359 --> 13649.439
I don't want to have any part in this I

13646.239 --> 13651.119999999999
want out and then he goes there at least

13649.439 --> 13654.399
that's in the version that I read I

13651.12 --> 13654.399000000001
don't know what version you

13654.68 --> 13658.52
read maybe there's like different

13656.8 --> 13661.519999999999
endings or something I don't

13658.52 --> 13661.52
know

13662.8 --> 13668.198999999999
but yeah I read the book in school as

13666.04 --> 13671.76
part of my English class that I got a

13668.199 --> 13673.960000000001
nine for because I was basically

13671.76 --> 13675.68
explaining very similar things to what

13673.96 --> 13677.519999999999
I'm talk how I'm talking about it right

13675.68 --> 13682.0
now I was just like this is really

13677.52 --> 13684.279
interesting and like yeah they they do

13682.0 --> 13686.159
actually make a case like this may be

13684.279 --> 13690.960000000001
feasible it's just

13686.159 --> 13693.199
that I don't understand everything yet

13690.96 --> 13694.64
I'm still too young to fully understand

13693.199 --> 13699.800000000001
it that's like what I was saying during

13694.64 --> 13699.8
the book report and yeah I aced it

13704.04 --> 13710.04
so yeah exactly loopi Evolution yeah

13707.96 --> 13714.159
they were shocked at seeing old people

13710.04 --> 13714.159000000001
because nobody really grew

13718.399 --> 13721.399
old

13733.88 --> 13737.358999999999
they shocked at the sight of an old

13735.56 --> 13738.8
person but also at the S side of a

13737.359 --> 13742.0
pregnant

13738.8 --> 13742.0
woman that

13743.88 --> 13752.358999999999
too like giving birth was like nobody

13747.56 --> 13752.359
got yeah that wasn't part of the main

13755.199 --> 13762.720000000001
society that's how they

13759.52 --> 13764.960000000001
avoided family bonding of any sort the

13762.72 --> 13768.64
only bond that people were having is

13764.96 --> 13770.119999999999
with their class of breed like with

13768.64 --> 13772.96
their

13770.12 --> 13775.92
level and that's it there was no

13772.96 --> 13780.479
personal unbreakable bonds and no father

13775.92 --> 13782.92
mother anything just like people of your

13780.479 --> 13786.679999999998
type and that's like the only

13782.92 --> 13786.68
Association you really had with other

13800.96 --> 13806.239
people why did I change my handle for 33

13804.64 --> 13809.08
what do you mean change my handle I

13806.239 --> 13810.68
didn't change it it was my handle from

13809.08 --> 13813.8
the

13810.68 --> 13817.279
start part of my email I chose it

13813.8 --> 13817.278999999999
because I like

13817.479 --> 13823.64
33 and I'm like I'm owning it I'm just

13821.279 --> 13823.640000000001
taking

13826.159 --> 13833.199
it Children of Men

13828.76 --> 13833.199
o intense that one rich

13838.239 --> 13841.239
G

13847.72 --> 13853.198999999999
I don't know is there like a

13850.12 --> 13856.560000000001
movie of Brave New World I don't know if

13853.199 --> 13856.560000000001
there even is a movie of

13857.64 --> 13864.519999999999
that I sure don't remember having seen

13861.0 --> 13868.159
any may maybe a really old one like from

13864.52 --> 13870.08
the 70s or 60s that looks

13868.159 --> 13873.319
terrible

13870.08 --> 13878.88
I don't remember there might be a

13873.319 --> 13878.88
movie but reading the book was like very

13879.12 --> 13883.239000000001
sufficient like that helped that helped

13881.96 --> 13886.0
understand it better because they were

13883.239 --> 13888.52
like really laying down like now this is

13886.0 --> 13891.12
very argued out philosophy like there's

13888.52 --> 13893.159
a reason why they're doing it like a

13891.12 --> 13895.84
reason that is

13893.159 --> 13897.84
effective like it has an important

13895.84 --> 13900.68
reason like everybody's behind it like

13897.84 --> 13902.199
how this all works and that was really

13900.68 --> 13904.52
fascinating about Brave New World

13902.199 --> 13904.52
reading

13906.319 --> 13912.72
it do I like the number 33 because of

13910.159 --> 13915.72
Jesus yeah I

13912.72 --> 13916.599999999999
guess and because we have 33 digits in

13915.72 --> 13918.519999999999
our

13916.6 --> 13924.439
spine

13918.52 --> 13924.439
and because just because because I like

13926.8 --> 13933.119999999999
it I was 331

13930.479 --> 13936.358999999999
was the year of my life now after that

13933.12 --> 13940.08
year it all went to [ __ ] but that year

13936.359 --> 13943.92
was like it felt like this is like the

13940.08 --> 13943.92
best year I've ever

13952.56 --> 13956.84
had I think sort

13958.04 --> 13961.04
of

13971.04 --> 13974.560000000001
so yeah duper I mean 33 there's all

13973.64 --> 13978.76
these

13974.56 --> 13981.479
associations I just liked it I I kind of

13978.76 --> 13983.319
I yeah Owen Benjamin is like this too

13981.479 --> 13985.92
it's like you hear so many people could

13983.319 --> 13988.76
play look oh 33 Illuminati confirmed

13985.92 --> 13993.479
blah blah blah and I'm like I'll take

13988.76 --> 13995.960000000001
that it's mine now I'm taking the 33 oh

13993.479 --> 13998.84
are an Illuminati yeah yeah cool and I

13995.96 --> 14001.759999999998
eat an Illuminati cant too so what you

13998.84 --> 14005.0
going to do now how are you going to

14001.76 --> 14008.6
prove that this all my conspiracy I'm

14005.0 --> 14011.56
actually the ruler of the world somehow

14008.6 --> 14013.12
you know it's like no I just own it I'm

14011.56 --> 14016.84
going to own this

14013.12 --> 14019.68
number and like you think that that

14016.84 --> 14022.359
means I'm up to something

14019.68 --> 14024.68
cool subscribe to my channel and check

14022.359 --> 14027.6
it out maybe you'll find out maybe you

14024.68 --> 14029.399
can decipher all the hidden code that

14027.6 --> 14033.479000000001
I'm rolling out without consciously even

14029.399 --> 14037.039999999999
knowing it you can too decipher the

14033.479 --> 14039.76
key to the to the gates of God or

14037.04 --> 14041.239000000001
whatever right I mean yeah I I'm just

14039.76 --> 14045.800000000001
like I'm taking

14041.239 --> 14050.88
it like oh 33 it's so scary oh okay

14045.8 --> 14050.88
that's mine now I'm taking it

14063.159 --> 14071.0
right that that's how I do it it's it is

14065.96 --> 14073.358999999999
also the way to to take it away from the

14071.0 --> 14075.319
devil it's kind of funny actually Alex

14073.359 --> 14078.199
Jones had a little segment on that on

14075.319 --> 14080.0
the show yesterday about that and it

14078.199 --> 14082.12
made sense

14080.0 --> 14084.76
like he said the same things as I've

14082.12 --> 14086.52
said like yeah the devil just

14084.76 --> 14089.239
takes

14086.52 --> 14091.12
symbols that have like a good and

14089.239 --> 14094.479
important meaning and then they corrupt

14091.12 --> 14096.76
it over time like even like the word gay

14094.479 --> 14099.76
which just meant Happy

14096.76 --> 14102.239
originally right and just like the

14099.76 --> 14104.52
pentagrams are now all associated with

14102.239 --> 14107.119999999999
Satan and all that well they were

14104.52 --> 14110.479000000001
absolutely not or even like the swastika

14107.12 --> 14111.880000000001
had a very prominent symbol that's all

14110.479 --> 14115.119999999999
about the

14111.88 --> 14117.358999999999
North and then that has been corrupted

14115.12 --> 14120.159000000001
right so Satan just takes things and

14117.359 --> 14121.800000000001
then corrupts it and then everybody just

14120.159 --> 14125.0
whenever they see it they always think

14121.8 --> 14128.039999999999
Oh that's oh that's evil because of that

14125.0 --> 14131.68
the way evil has used that symbol abused

14128.04 --> 14133.880000000001
it and then that's supposed to like undo

14131.68 --> 14136.52
all the good that it was before that

14133.88 --> 14139.519999999999
well effectively it does to

14136.52 --> 14144.239
people I'm somebody that's like how

14139.52 --> 14148.239
about I just undo everything yeah I'm

14144.239 --> 14151.72
going to undo everything all the e all

14148.239 --> 14155.88
of it by negating it by just using it

14151.72 --> 14157.88
the right way without being phased by

14155.88 --> 14161.198999999999
anything and everybody can just

14157.88 --> 14161.96
like you can do that too you can negate

14161.199 --> 14167.720000000001
the

14161.96 --> 14170.72
evil by simply using it the old

14167.72 --> 14170.72
way

14171.0 --> 14179.68
just ignore the evil negate it don't be

14176.12 --> 14183.6
stigmatized by the evil use of

14179.68 --> 14186.76
symbols use it the right way and just

14183.6 --> 14186.76
forget about the

14187.84 --> 14193.52
evil the evil way of doing it

14193.6 --> 14199.479000000001
right it's what one of my principles and

14197.359 --> 14204.12
in that

14199.479 --> 14207.198999999999
in the line of that thought I chose 33

14204.12 --> 14210.0
it's like yeah I'll take

14207.199 --> 14213.560000000001
it and that's how I took the pentagrams

14210.0 --> 14218.84
too like make took two pentagrams fuse

14213.56 --> 14222.278999999999
them into one the 10 star or sun like I

14218.84 --> 14224.279
made my own symbol out of those older

14222.279 --> 14226.800000000001
symbols that are associated with all

14224.279 --> 14231.279
kinds of things and I was like how about

14226.8 --> 14236.08
just no how about it's not just evil

14231.279 --> 14241.439
anymore how about we undo the evil the

14236.08 --> 14246.359
unal an evil smear upon

14241.439 --> 14250.199
symbols yeah this violation of good

14246.359 --> 14252.359
things why let evil take

14250.199 --> 14254.399000000001
everything like that's stupid like

14252.359 --> 14257.800000000001
that's the only way they can win too is

14254.399 --> 14259.319
by basically thinking that evil can

14257.8 --> 14261.72
corrupt symbol

14259.319 --> 14265.159
if everybody thinks it can happen then

14261.72 --> 14266.679999999998
it does because everybody thinks it does

14265.159 --> 14269.72
and so it

14266.68 --> 14273.12
does but if you just say like yeah you

14269.72 --> 14275.119999999999
don't have that power you're a clown

14273.12 --> 14277.439
you're trying to make us all scared with

14275.12 --> 14281.76
your disgusting [ __ ] and we're just not

14277.439 --> 14284.359
buying it like you're just an idiot yeah

14281.76 --> 14288.68
that's how you actually defeat

14284.359 --> 14291.84
evil not by counter chanting we have to

14288.68 --> 14294.359
do good magic to counter the evil magic

14291.84 --> 14298.279
or you just say no everything you do is

14294.359 --> 14300.880000000001
completely useless we're not falling for

14298.279 --> 14300.880000000001
the fear

14302.68 --> 14311.04
spell yeah that's the best way it's just

14306.479 --> 14314.519999999999
you disenchant it and then the old Power

14311.04 --> 14318.12
that is really there becomes available

14314.52 --> 14319.960000000001
to you again because you dispelled the

14318.12 --> 14322.04
evil

14319.96 --> 14324.759999999998
view of

14322.04 --> 14326.960000000001
it I know does that make any sense to

14324.76 --> 14326.960000000001
you

14329.92 --> 14334.239
guys it

14331.68 --> 14335.399
should I think Owen Benjamin even talked

14334.239 --> 14338.479
about this

14335.399 --> 14339.72
so was very right oh by the way I talked

14338.479 --> 14343.76
about it

14339.72 --> 14346.8
first and also recently I heard Owen

14343.76 --> 14349.0
having basically adapted to my version

14346.8 --> 14351.72
of his theory about Hitler he said no

14349.0 --> 14357.04
Hitler is a lesbian now he says oh it's

14351.72 --> 14359.599999999999
two people H who said that who said that

14357.04 --> 14361.720000000001
like the first day he came up with that

14359.6 --> 14366.08
oh yeah that's little old

14361.72 --> 14368.84
me like yeah he has a double a lesbian

14366.08 --> 14372.08
double the lesbian double took over

14368.84 --> 14375.439
during the war and he went

14372.08 --> 14377.439
to Antarctica or at least

14375.439 --> 14380.84
argentinia

14377.439 --> 14384.08
Argentina and that's why that Hitler was

14380.84 --> 14386.279
so different and Owen talked about that

14384.08 --> 14388.199
yesterday or the day before and suddenly

14386.279 --> 14391.359
presented it like that like no it's

14388.199 --> 14394.12
probably two people and I'm

14391.359 --> 14397.880000000001
like he might have

14394.12 --> 14398.68
uh my idea might have like spread around

14397.88 --> 14401.239
a

14398.68 --> 14402.6
little cuz that's not how we started

14401.239 --> 14406.439
that

14402.6 --> 14409.199
story he just said no Hitler's a lesbian

14406.439 --> 14414.319
that's how it started now it's 2 people

14409.199 --> 14414.319000000001
like it probably was not the same

14416.399 --> 14420.278999999999
person what do you think about

14422.359 --> 14426.84
that did any of you pick up on

14428.399 --> 14431.96
that come on

14437.319 --> 14440.319
guys

14440.96 --> 14446.88
almost hitting the 4our mark

14443.88 --> 14446.88
sure

14457.08 --> 14462.399
okay yeah that's funny that you mention

14459.92 --> 14463.8
that with the 33 but that's exactly what

14462.399 --> 14466.64
happened with

14463.8 --> 14469.198999999999
me it's exactly what happened with me

14466.64 --> 14472.119999999999
exactly like that

14469.199 --> 14475.6
like that's my ex-girlfriend that's the

14472.12 --> 14475.6
year she broke up with me

14478.84 --> 14484.439
too you agree with that right but also

14482.56 --> 14487.399
that I called it

14484.439 --> 14489.64
first I'm sorry I mean I'm Just a Nobody

14487.399 --> 14492.119999999999
Here Owen Benjamin is way funnier than I

14489.64 --> 14496.399
am and he's way better at live streaming

14492.12 --> 14498.84
but I mean I I did call that specific

14496.399 --> 14500.88
form first

14498.84 --> 14505.56
as a direct response to him bringing it

14500.88 --> 14508.119999999999
up like hey hit there's not wasn't a guy

14505.56 --> 14511.76
there's something weird going on and

14508.12 --> 14515.239000000001
everything making fun of it's like f and

14511.76 --> 14518.239
all that and and then it was like uh

14515.239 --> 14518.239
that's not the same

14527.159 --> 14530.159
person

14531.72 --> 14537.479
you'll prefer my show really wow I'm

14538.88 --> 14544.0
honored Owen does get very rowdy at

14541.8 --> 14546.159
times and

14544.0 --> 14549.76
gross but I

14546.159 --> 14551.64
mean he is always so energetic though

14549.76 --> 14554.399
he's always in the

14551.64 --> 14556.278999999999
flow I mean I try to be in the flow but

14554.399 --> 14558.399
just look at the first three hours of

14556.279 --> 14560.279
today's show was just like nothing

14558.399 --> 14562.96
happened that's never happened to ow

14560.279 --> 14565.6
when ever like even on his worst day

14562.96 --> 14568.278999999999
that's not like

14565.6 --> 14569.76
that but I mean he just he wouldn't have

14568.279 --> 14573.279
the time to

14569.76 --> 14576.72
waste like that anyway he would just

14573.279 --> 14576.720000000001
quit if that

14578.6 --> 14584.479000000001
happened yeah but thank you I didn't

14581.199 --> 14584.479000000001
know that preferred my

14586.239 --> 14591.08
show I mean when I'm in the flow I also

14589.239 --> 14592.64
very much like watching my own show

14591.08 --> 14595.8
there's some shows that I watched back

14592.64 --> 14598.599999999999
where I was like wow this was great like

14595.8 --> 14601.84
this was really great to watch and it

14598.6 --> 14607.439
surprises me it surprises me that my

14601.84 --> 14610.56
show is so great to watch at

14607.439 --> 14612.720000000001
times like that genuinely surprises me

14610.56 --> 14616.319
it's like almost like I don't recognize

14612.72 --> 14620.239
myself it's like this makes no sense I'm

14616.319 --> 14623.159
not that entertaining I'm not that good

14620.239 --> 14624.76
I was like yeah apparently I

14623.159 --> 14627.76
am

14624.76 --> 14627.76
okay

14636.8 --> 14643.72
weird he glows but he's got a wife and

14639.92 --> 14643.72
yes that helps it does help

14647.0 --> 14650.0
absolutely

14653.399 --> 14660.278999999999
a general plan with this show well Owen

14657.12 --> 14662.800000000001
is just very he's a comedian he has a

14660.279 --> 14664.319000000001
very good memory and he knows how to

14662.8 --> 14667.56
plan

14664.319 --> 14669.84
things so he's like just thinking all

14667.56 --> 14674.039999999999
day long on what what is he going to do

14669.84 --> 14677.12
next day I don't really do

14674.04 --> 14679.279
that it's very rare that I have like oh

14677.12 --> 14684.04
I'm definitely going to talk about this

14679.279 --> 14684.04
tomorrow it's like it's very rarely

14684.199 --> 14688.6
happens I just do things spontaneously

14687.04 --> 14690.76
and if there was anything really

14688.6 --> 14695.08
interesting noteworthy I will just like

14690.76 --> 14695.08
oh yeah that thing oh here's here's

14695.239 --> 14699.64
it I don't really plan I don't like

14697.8 --> 14701.319
really oh I'm going to talk about this

14699.64 --> 14705.72
today I mean how many times have you

14701.319 --> 14709.6
heard me say that maybe like 5 to 10

14705.72 --> 14713.358999999999
times in 1800 show

14709.6 --> 14713.359
like I I rarely do

14716.359 --> 14722.6
that like about my show spe yeah the

14720.08 --> 14725.479
spontaneity is yeah

14722.6 --> 14727.84
but I guess that's nice that you like

14725.479 --> 14730.8
that but I mean it just works the best

14727.84 --> 14733.6
that way for me it works

14730.8 --> 14736.399
better like I have

14733.6 --> 14742.08
more skill more

14736.399 --> 14742.08
energy available able to me when I do it

14742.199 --> 14746.199
spontaneously I get more energy out when

14744.52 --> 14749.6
I pre-plan things it's like the

14746.199 --> 14753.68
pre-planning almost distracts

14749.6 --> 14756.6
me I've just learned that I can do

14753.68 --> 14759.76
things way better on average with most

14756.6 --> 14759.76
things if I do it

14760.159 --> 14764.64
spontaneously and so I basically don't

14763.64 --> 14769.72
really

14764.64 --> 14773.0
plan I do but I keep it very

14769.72 --> 14776.84
tiny it's like I plan to do certain

14773.0 --> 14779.159
things and as I'm doing it I will like

14776.84 --> 14780.92
spontaneously do it and spontaneously

14779.159 --> 14783.56
figure it

14780.92 --> 14786.68
out it's like oh I'm going to have to

14783.56 --> 14789.0
have a talk with that guy well I'm not

14786.68 --> 14791.08
going to be like planning on like oh am

14789.0 --> 14793.84
I going to bring up this and that I just

14791.08 --> 14798.399
walk up to them and like I will just in

14793.84 --> 14801.68
the moment size up what can I say

14798.399 --> 14805.08
like what is like from the energy it's

14801.68 --> 14806.92
just like what can I say here and then

14805.08 --> 14809.84
it just

14806.92 --> 14812.8
happens it's how I do things it's like

14809.84 --> 14814.880000000001
very intuitive and spontaneous and it

14812.8 --> 14817.92
just works out really well especially if

14814.88 --> 14817.92
you do that all your

14821.239 --> 14826.72
life right I've definitely crossed the

14824.72 --> 14829.679999999998
4our

14826.72 --> 14833.438999999998
mark

14829.68 --> 14833.439
18 watching picking back

14836.57 --> 14839.628999999999
[Music]

14844.07 --> 14855.61
[Music]

14856.72 --> 14859.72
up

14865.0 --> 14869.76
modifying the title the basic that's

14867.72 --> 14872.039999999999
weird the title is basically a

14869.76 --> 14874.960000000001
description of how the show

14872.04 --> 14878.6
went slow

14874.96 --> 14880.8
start trying to get back in the flow

14878.6 --> 14884.720000000001
gets good after three

14880.8 --> 14889.64
hours that is a weird title though but I

14884.72 --> 14889.64
like it I like I like it like that

14916.159 --> 14920.92
H good to pleas coming up glad you're

14918.68 --> 14923.880000000001
feeling better thank you thank you I I

14920.92 --> 14924.960000000001
mean I I am better right I mean just a

14923.88 --> 14926.72
whole

14924.96 --> 14928.919999999998
different

14926.72 --> 14931.88
composure and I feel different and I

14928.92 --> 14934.56
feel more free and it can just flow and

14931.88 --> 14936.319
I'll really I'll do my best to keep it

14934.56 --> 14939.56
like

14936.319 --> 14943.239
that to not accidentally let the curse

14939.56 --> 14943.239
slip back in I'll be

14943.68 --> 14949.960000000001
fine maybe I'll I hope that this go is

14947.68 --> 14953.04
accompanied with like some really solid

14949.96 --> 14954.759999999998
sleep this night I really need like just

14953.04 --> 14957.359
proper sleep

14954.76 --> 14959.399
finally not where I'm just laying there

14957.359 --> 14960.319
resting but not falling asleep because

14959.399 --> 14963.319
that

14960.319 --> 14966.278999999999
sucks all right

14963.319 --> 14970.0
anyway I'm going to round out might have

14966.279 --> 14972.239
been one of the longest shows in a while

14970.0 --> 14974.119
like four hours and 50 minutes or

14972.239 --> 14975.6
something eventually that's what it's

14974.119 --> 14978.52
going to

14975.6 --> 14981.640000000001
show anyhow thanks everyone for coming

hours were not all that great but then

14984.96 --> 14989.919999999998
