[Music]

37.76 --> 46.8
good morning welcome to flatter the

42.21 --> 48.57
earlybird number 242 I'm your host

46.8 --> 50.57899999999999
Arwen and before we start the show

48.57 --> 51.809
please don't forget to share it on any

50.579 --> 53.19
platform you deem fit

51.809 --> 54.959999999999994
and also if you haven't already

53.19 --> 56.46
subscribed to my channel and hit the

54.96 --> 58.079
bell notification so you know when I'm

56.46 --> 61.379
long live which is normally 2:00 p.m.

58.079 --> 63.839
Amsterdam time every day also please

61.379 --> 67.14
support me through the super chat PayPal

63.839 --> 73.17
patreon and my GoFundMe much appreciate

67.14 --> 78.149
it so yeah today sweater the heaters on

73.17 --> 81.33
because yeah today it's just non-stop

78.149 --> 85.22
raining it's it's actually been

81.33 --> 89.24
lightning storming pretty much

85.22 --> 92.67
constantly in the last three hours now

89.24 --> 94.97
currently it just seems that migrated

92.67 --> 97.83
the lightning but it was like right over

94.97 --> 101.67
over my house pretty much got pretty

97.83 --> 103.819
loud but yeah the Lightning seems to

101.67 --> 108.75
have died off it's just raining still

103.819 --> 115.759
it's been like that pretty much all

108.75 --> 115.759
night and the whole morning really moist

115.789 --> 125.39
so yeah how are you all doing I got

121.289 --> 131.72
Tamara coffee with me today and tea

125.39 --> 131.72
that's it let's see who is here

134.34 --> 139.02
yeah everybody popped in pretty much

137.28 --> 142.83
last ten minutes and then got really

139.02 --> 146.489
chatty I like that but really chatty

142.83 --> 149.73000000000002
part yeah so there's a gem Jason core

146.489 --> 155.97
Mac Mac collared mind-warped sin over

149.73 --> 162.2
muku Amanda young Steve James Mason bill

155.97 --> 170.69
G Jeffrey bill Voynich that one guy

162.2 --> 170.69
michael roark flat accord music

175.319 --> 181.14
Eddie Bravo fanboy yeah yeah good to see

180.689 --> 183.9
you all

181.14 --> 186.42
it's kind of funny now that I'm thinking

183.9 --> 188.519
about it actually like naming everyone

186.42 --> 191.189
that's present it kind of gives this

188.519 --> 193.17000000000002
weird I just I've been doing this for

191.189 --> 195.209
more than half a year but kind of now

193.17 --> 199.70899999999997
starts to remind me like yeah that's

195.209 --> 202.47
kind of reminds me of of class like when

199.709 --> 207.48
class starts it's like hello everyone

202.47 --> 211.68
let's take the the presents list go

207.48 --> 213.13899999999998
through the fair so I expect you to be

211.68 --> 217.109
here at 2 o'clock

213.139 --> 219.299
Amsterdam time gotta be present or you

217.109 --> 223.139
gonna get on the abscence list gonna get

219.299 --> 225.359
marked for absence nah but it does give

223.139 --> 231.26000000000002
a bit of a feel like it so I kind of

225.359 --> 231.26000000000002
like that hey Constance

237.3 --> 242.10000000000002
roll-call if you're not here detention

242.49 --> 249.49
yeah mandatory visiting the panel on

246.46 --> 258.519
Jose's if you don't get on time on my

249.49 --> 264.91
show alright so man a lot has happened

258.519 --> 267.55
yesterday I listened back to my own

264.91 --> 273.94
hangout and I thought it was pretty good

267.55 --> 279.40000000000003
although I was kind of swimming a lot I

273.94 --> 283.98
did make a few put down a couple of good

279.4 --> 288.48999999999995
things oh yeah then of course the

283.98 --> 291.19
confrontation yesterday so I don't know

288.49 --> 295.81
who of you have paid attention to that

291.19 --> 300.67
but on the debates right hand came up

295.81 --> 302.98
and I just defended him honestly yeah I

300.67 --> 306.49
did put down the criticism on his

302.98 --> 309.31
behavior and like yet tried to sound

306.49 --> 311.01
less like a SOI boy raging it's really

309.31 --> 315.04
not helping anyone

311.01 --> 319.32
but yeah the the presentation was

315.04 --> 322.93
despite a couple of yes drum and

319.32 --> 327.52
arguments was pretty interesting and I

322.93 --> 331.05
liked it correlated a lot with many of

327.52 --> 333.60999999999996
my ideas I have in on the matter and

331.05 --> 335.08
yeah that was interesting but yeah I got

333.61 --> 339.28000000000003
totally assaulted for it

335.08 --> 344.55
so people may yeah noticed that I really

339.28 --> 350.40999999999997
did and at first they were basically

344.55 --> 354.13
well not getting it and they weirdly

350.41 --> 355.78000000000003
enough misinterpreted my action and I

354.13 --> 357.49
think the same goes for right to hand

355.78 --> 361.95
although he maybe he gets it a little

357.49 --> 361.95
jumbled up I'm not sure but

362.0 --> 371.25
they basically strawman me with with

367.92 --> 373.41
that I supposedly claimed the wave which

371.25 --> 375.84
I didn't and I never have it's very

373.41 --> 377.61
obviously why I was talking about

375.84 --> 382.82
something entirely different I explained

377.61 --> 386.73
it I think twice they just didn't get it

382.82 --> 391.46999999999997
like I think Nathan really didn't get it

386.73 --> 393.93
he was he felt like he was improvising

391.47 --> 399.12
because he just was lost and he lost

393.93 --> 401.61
track of he couldn't follow somehow the

399.12 --> 403.95
train of thought he couldn't figure it

401.61 --> 406.22
out what I was doing and I don't know

403.95 --> 410.67
about quantum eraser might be the same

406.22 --> 413.1
so i i'm not even sure there is like

410.67 --> 417.63
some genuine gatekeeping going on it

413.1 --> 421.49
might literally be just a natural thing

417.63 --> 425.37
due to how they function where they got

421.49 --> 427.65000000000003
in their development I don't know what

425.37 --> 431.45
it is but they yeah I felt pretty

427.65 --> 434.47999999999996
assaulted I got kind of loud and

431.45 --> 438.03
eventually I just left because like

434.48 --> 439.82
having Nathan say yes or your we totally

438.03 --> 442.79999999999995
obliterated you that's something I find

439.82 --> 445.23
absolutely unacceptable when they

442.8 --> 448.25
obviously and kind of admittedly on the

445.23 --> 453.63
spot didn't even get what I was saying

448.25 --> 457.14
and I'm I'm like seriously offended by

453.63 --> 462.18
that not because that happened but

457.14 --> 465.95
because it's not like Nathan knows me he

462.18 --> 468.39
should know me I've been well

465.95 --> 470.76
interacting with him on a daily basis

468.39 --> 471.87
for years now and he should know me

470.76 --> 476.84999999999997
better hey there's another lightning

471.87 --> 479.58
strike and I'm just disappointed and I

476.85 --> 482.82000000000005
don't know I I kind of have a reluctance

479.58 --> 485.94
now to join the debates after my show

482.82 --> 488.33
because I feel like yeah after that I

485.94 --> 488.33
just

488.5 --> 500.65
I need to go somewhere elsewhere where

496.42 --> 502.06
people are not yeah well yeah going to

500.65 --> 504.28
Jose it's not gonna help because they

502.06 --> 506.83
strawman me per default that's that Bay

504.28 --> 509.10999999999996
that's the default setting there with

506.83 --> 511.12
pretty much everything but at least I

509.11 --> 515.76
can expect that [Â __Â ] from them

511.12 --> 520.51
because they are just set in their ways

515.76 --> 522.849
but anyway yeah mind-warped good to see

520.51 --> 531.61
you for your is for you it's in the

522.849 --> 537.12
evening oh god yeah a mind warp would

531.61 --> 537.12
you like to come on on skype

543.69 --> 550.2700000000001
okay technical questions I see Jeffrey

547.48 --> 553.1800000000001
Bell asks my question not only that over

550.27 --> 556.06
but what happens to evaporate to the

553.18 --> 559.3299999999999
evaporated water that it goes into the

556.06 --> 562.39
atmosphere well it goes it dissolves

559.33 --> 565.3000000000001
into the air as long as the temperature

562.39 --> 570.61
is correct for it as long as it is high

565.3 --> 572.5
enough and then when it reaches spots

570.61 --> 577.54
where it is kind of too cold that's

572.5 --> 580.09
where the water then starts to to

577.54 --> 582.13
compensate again locally just where

580.09 --> 584.02
where that moisture hits the temperature

582.13 --> 585.61
that's part of how clouds basically come

584.02 --> 588.88
to be they hit that the cold enough

585.61 --> 592.0500000000001
layer and then they start to just kind

588.88 --> 592.05
of float there

595.66 --> 601.81
so yeah water vapor it dissolves in the

600.64 --> 606.22
air you have to understand what

601.81 --> 612.28
dissolving is it mixes in and it starts

606.22 --> 615.1600000000001
to equally spread out and mix in with

612.28 --> 617.86
the material to form kind of like an

615.16 --> 622.15
equilibrium in amounts it just naturally

617.86 --> 626.98
starts to fall in place in a way if well

622.15 --> 630.63
with gases yeah that happens unless it

626.98 --> 633.28
somehow wouldn't mix but yeah moisture

630.63 --> 638.02
definitely does dissolve in regular air

633.28 --> 640.4499999999999
there may be other types of gases who

638.02 --> 642.61
knows that don't necessarily dissolve

640.45 --> 646.8100000000001
into air right away that could be kept

642.61 --> 648.4300000000001
separate like water like regular water

646.81 --> 651.91
from air I don't know

648.43 --> 654.67
but water vapor definitely does spread

651.91 --> 659.77
out and dissolve in air it mixes in with

654.67 --> 662.3499999999999
it equally until it hits the the the the

659.77 --> 665.26
temperature that's low enough for it so

662.35 --> 670.0500000000001
it can no longer stay dissolved in the

665.26 --> 673.41
air and starts to condensate so yeah

670.05 --> 673.41
good question

676.5 --> 681.0
super curve are you serious

686.39 --> 691.99
what a favor is a gas yep that I know

692.949 --> 701.319
it dissolves the water vapor is a gas

696.97 --> 706.499
yes it turns to a gaseous state and that

701.319 --> 706.4989999999999
water vapor gas it dissolves in the air

713.1 --> 719.86
solids can also dissolve in liquids

715.93 --> 725.5
indeed and liquids can dissolve in

719.86 --> 728.34
liquids if they are compatible there's

725.5 --> 736.45
all kind of these or dissolving

728.34 --> 740.95
processes oh my god yes but I said I

736.45 --> 743.1
talked about water vapor yes it

740.95 --> 750.57
evaporates and then that water vapor

743.1 --> 756.76
dissolves in the rest of the air it does

750.57 --> 761.11
spreads out it mixes in that that's what

756.76 --> 768.48
I was saying and I get this it's not

761.11 --> 768.48
true now dissolves means mixing in

772.18 --> 781.0899999999999
dilutes weights okay now I have to make

777.37 --> 785.04
sure that about the word maybe I

781.09 --> 785.0400000000001
technically got it wrong I see

796.68 --> 807.27
reference to solid okay hmm

803.45 --> 810.3900000000001
all right I may have to overstep the

807.27 --> 812.76
meaning of this off maybe it is only

810.39 --> 814.29
specific to solid Oh at least that's

812.76 --> 819.39
what the first thing that pops up here

814.29 --> 821.37
that it is only solids into liquid okay

819.39 --> 824.84
then I guess it's not dissolve

821.37 --> 827.79
I guess it's then dispersing right or

824.84 --> 830.2800000000001
diluting diluting is that mixing in

827.79 --> 833.8199999999999
right yeah diluting because it's the

830.28 --> 836.16
same state then it's not a dissolving

833.82 --> 843.44
okay sorry I just that's kind of a

836.16 --> 846.6899999999999
language plus technical issue right oh

843.44 --> 850.7
yeah super curve that's what I described

846.69 --> 854.0400000000001
I just used a technically incorrect

850.7 --> 856.74
terminology for it because apparently

854.04 --> 858.81
it's not that wide as I thought it was

856.74 --> 860.99
you know even I can make mistakes with

858.81 --> 860.9899999999999
that

866.77 --> 869.77
what

872.51 --> 885.27
Brenda oh my god oh my god Brenda are

878.73 --> 896.13
you serious yeah okay I'm gonna look

885.27 --> 904.01
that up water vapor is a gas water vapor

896.13 --> 908.07
water is the gaseous phase of water is

904.01 --> 912.0889999999999
one state of water within the holders

908.07 --> 915.029
fear water vapor can be produced from

912.089 --> 920.99
the evaporation or boiling of liquid

915.029 --> 924.06
water or from the sublimation of ice

920.99 --> 930.029
right because that also exists ice can

924.06 --> 935.6099999999999
apparently directly transit back in and

930.029 --> 938.209
- gasps wait yeah exactly it's very

935.61 --> 943.2
weird water can do all kinds of things

938.209 --> 946.8599999999999
but it is a gaseous phase or a state as

943.2 --> 948.6600000000001
in gas as in no longer water droplets

946.86 --> 953.76
the water droplets are actually the

948.66 --> 956.0889999999999
recondense water that was dissolved in

953.76 --> 956.0889999999999
the air

964.92 --> 970.679
right okay well I made a mistake

967.649 --> 973.859
technically Brenda made a mistake I'm

970.679 --> 975.949
glad you're correcting yourself it's

973.859 --> 979.73
good sign

975.949 --> 979.7299999999999
take it for what it's worth

980.8 --> 983.9
[Music]

986.39 --> 992.5699999999999
yeah Wow according to this thing the

990.769 --> 995.63
boiling point is not a hundred degrees

992.57 --> 999.37
Celsius it's ninety nine point nine

995.63 --> 999.37
eight degrees Celsius

1006.59 --> 1013.49
I wonder now was it always that or did

1010.31 --> 1015.8599999999999
it change because if it changed could we

1013.49 --> 1017.99
then conclude that the overall pressure

1015.86 --> 1020.69
with an air realm is slightly decreased

1017.99 --> 1024.73
because that would cause the boiling

1020.69 --> 1024.73
point to lower in temperature

1033.67 --> 1038.4
it was probably always just ninety nine

1036.5 --> 1043.24
point nine eight

1038.4 --> 1043.24
[Music]

1047.38 --> 1058.029
I don't know about that bill gee well

1054.46 --> 1063.6100000000001
you have like the the putty state so for

1058.029 --> 1068.919
example custard it is fluid but it is

1063.61 --> 1072.6689999999999
technically not a liquid I think it's

1068.919 --> 1078.039
just a mash of flexible solids that are

1072.669 --> 1080.74
sticky now oh wait yeah click fluidity

1078.039 --> 1084.37
right yeah a gas and liquid are both

1080.74 --> 1089.97
fluid it is a description of the ability

1084.37 --> 1089.9699999999998
doesn't tie into a specific state right

1095.08 --> 1104.47
non-newtonian I love it

1099.67 --> 1114.1100000000001
custard is a non-newtonian fluid oh dear

1104.47 --> 1116.3500000000001
love it that's larious that's like a

1114.11 --> 1119.33
hidden gem hidden

1116.35 --> 1121.25
that's hilarious to hear that because I

1119.33 --> 1124.84
do remember that that being mentioned

1121.25 --> 1128.03
about it and now that I'm like into this

1124.84 --> 1129.9499999999998
flat earth and physics rediscovery

1128.03 --> 1135.05
journey it's hilarious to hear that it's

1129.95 --> 1145.94
a non-newtonian fluid so is it an

1135.05 --> 1148.06
Einsteinian fluid then that was your

1145.94 --> 1148.06
joke

1159.99 --> 1165.63
oh right well super curve that's another

1163.68 --> 1169.2
way to describe that you don't have to

1165.63 --> 1174.1200000000001
call it non-newtonian it simply has a

1169.2 --> 1177.78
massive surface tension that's it

1174.12 --> 1181.4699999999998
surface tension is the thing with sudden

1177.78 --> 1184.25
impact that it is regard in that the

1181.47 --> 1190.92
stickiness that makes perfect sense

1184.25 --> 1197.54
stickiness so it's a massive surface

1190.92 --> 1197.54
tension that's what it has as a property

1200.41 --> 1206.5900000000001
but yeah any weight can always well well

1204.73 --> 1208.3600000000001
a lot of weight can break through

1206.59 --> 1212.9499999999998
surface tension like a speck of dust

1208.36 --> 1215.7099999999998
will still float on water potentially

1212.95 --> 1218.44
until at some point like yeah it becomes

1215.71 --> 1222.55
immersed in it and then it may sink

1218.44 --> 1224.38
whatever there's that surface tension

1222.55 --> 1226.99
with custard it's just incredible

1224.38 --> 1231.5800000000002
because it can handle huge amounts of

1226.99 --> 1233.56
mass or weight however you see that for

1231.58 --> 1238.9499999999998
a short while before the surface tension

1233.56 --> 1241.48
breaks and you start to sink in I

1238.95 --> 1244.0
wouldn't call that not it wouldn't

1241.48 --> 1246.85
declare the material non-newtonian

1244.0 --> 1250.56
because of that I just say yeah it's it

1246.85 --> 1250.56
has a massive surface tension

1255.69 --> 1262.5900000000001
it's like a quicksand trampoline you can

1260.61 --> 1266.9299999999998
run over custard but if you stand still

1262.59 --> 1266.9299999999998
then you start to sink in you're screwed

1279.82 --> 1287.95
right bilgey yes yes so have I it's

1283.749 --> 1292.71
fascinating because apparently glass

1287.95 --> 1296.559
does malformed and can even melt and

1292.71 --> 1300.009
especially if it's very hot then that

1296.559 --> 1306.029
would actually make the melting go

1300.009 --> 1306.029
quicker that's interesting isn't it

1315.36 --> 1318.77
if it's Casa T

1328.13 --> 1342.3000000000002
okay let me see I'm gonna compare

1331.98 --> 1344.4
surface tension to viscosity yeah by the

1342.3 --> 1348.1499999999999
way I'll just present this and said I

1344.4 --> 1354.6000000000001
did that yesterday I share my stuff you

1348.15 --> 1355.73
know sure what I'm doing so yeah okay

1354.6 --> 1359.1599999999999
here we go

1355.73 --> 1363.33
viscosity the state of being thick

1359.16 --> 1374.18
sticky semifluid inconsistency due to

1363.33 --> 1378.9299999999998
eternal friction okay so it yeah that

1374.18 --> 1380.1000000000001
that's kind of exactly the opposite huh

1378.93 --> 1382.5600000000002
I didn't think of that oh by the way

1380.1 --> 1384.4199999999998
thank you a monday young for the $2 ship

1382.56 --> 1387.48
which a donation you should have your

1384.42 --> 1390.8100000000002
own debate show why not look I am open

1387.48 --> 1393.72
for people on the panel I kind of hope

1390.81 --> 1404.07
that Mindwarp would join me but he

1393.72 --> 1408.81
hasn't said anything yet but okay sofas

1404.07 --> 1413.79
Casa T its Duty elective the friction is

1408.81 --> 1418.74
preventing it from giving way so it's

1413.79 --> 1423.48
not surface tension although may also be

1418.74 --> 1426.63
correlated but it's the ability to pull

1423.48 --> 1430.1100000000001
apart that's basically doing the most of

1426.63 --> 1433.49
it okay that makes sense then yeah III

1430.11 --> 1433.49
got the wrong angle to it

1443.09 --> 1448.84
hmmm that's funny because typically then

1446.059 --> 1454.6689999999999
in Wikipedia is attributed to basically

1448.84 --> 1460.779
fluids that are like become syrupy that

1454.669 --> 1460.779
are saturated

1464.31 --> 1467.24
that's interesting

1476.12 --> 1483.02
right okay sofas I don't see the

1478.95 --> 1485.64
relation really to non-newtonian ism I

1483.02 --> 1489.87
think that's just the stamp they put on

1485.64 --> 1490.3500000000001
it I don't see it as any relevant in any

1489.87 --> 1493.59
way

1490.35 --> 1496.4099999999999
it's just viscosity so there's surface

1493.59 --> 1499.4099999999999
tension there's viscosity I I should

1496.41 --> 1502.02
keep those two words close to one

1499.41 --> 1503.73
another because I might have mixed up

1502.02 --> 1511.25
the concept of surface tension and

1503.73 --> 1511.25
viscosity before dam language barrier

1515.79 --> 1522.69
okay super curve whatever you say

1519.89 --> 1530.91
non-newtonian exchange of viscosity

1522.69 --> 1533.1200000000001
that's a nice declaration I think I'll

1530.91 --> 1536.5800000000002
just call it a change in viscosity

1533.12 --> 1540.8999999999999
because that kind of is more specific to

1536.58 --> 1543.9299999999998
what's actually being described I don't

1540.9 --> 1553.02
see the the use of dragging Newton into

1543.93 --> 1556.79
it right surface tension is why insects

1553.02 --> 1556.79
could skate across the pond right

1563.1 --> 1569.25
I guess that makes sense they're like

1566.789 --> 1574.799
two opposites of the same scale the

1569.25 --> 1579.32
surface tension is not viscosity but it

1574.799 --> 1584.1299999999999
is like stronger surface tensions allow

1579.32 --> 1586.529
less mass or like more mass to basically

1584.13 --> 1589.44
just stay on top of it without even

1586.529 --> 1594.509
penetrating it and the viscosity is when

1589.44 --> 1596.6390000000001
it exceeds that limit then how long it

1594.509 --> 1599.73
will take until it penetrates it

1596.639 --> 1604.289
actually so water has an extremely low

1599.73 --> 1608.279
viscosity but it has a somewhat of the

1604.289 --> 1611.759
surface tension and custard basically

1608.279 --> 1614.309
has so much viscosity that may have some

1611.759 --> 1617.429
surface tension but it's basically yeah

1614.309 --> 1620.6689999999999
it's outdone by the overall viscosity of

1617.429 --> 1623.3400000000001
the material huh interesting

1620.669 --> 1626.49
yeah I was right to basically put those

1623.34 --> 1633.269
two together they're like two opposites

1626.49 --> 1635.7
of the same after alpha related they're

1633.269 --> 1637.83
related the effects are related they're

1635.7 --> 1642.049
they seem to be tied in to the same type

1637.83 --> 1642.049
of spectrum interesting interesting

1647.87 --> 1658.889
ya know now relative density now

1653.22 --> 1665.429
viscosity and surface tension really

1658.889 --> 1667.74
have to do with the what the material

1665.429 --> 1670.1390000000001
does with each other under in opposition

1667.74 --> 1673.429
to other densities as it were

1670.139 --> 1675.7199999999998
after equilibrium mostly mostly after

1673.429 --> 1678.95
has been reached but the relative

1675.72 --> 1683.09
density is the thing that makes it all

1678.95 --> 1685.47
displace towards its relative density

1683.09 --> 1687.99
equilibrium points its where it would

1685.47 --> 1691.289
naturally go because of its relative

1687.99 --> 1693.809
density in the medium so they yeah they

1691.289 --> 1701.12
don't replace it they just come

1693.809 --> 1701.12
afterward right mind-warped

1706.73 --> 1712.9
alright I'll get you on cool thanks for

1713.18 --> 1747.72
[Music]

1804.31 --> 1811.1299999999999
oops sorry yeah indeed I was a mute

1808.55 --> 1815.27
because of the normal Akio thank you for

1811.13 --> 1818.71
reminding me I like I just laughed about

1815.27 --> 1821.72
gravity Griffith what is it

1818.71 --> 1828.02
the custard proves gravity super curves

1821.72 --> 1830.54
that this is just freakin hilarious yeah

1828.02 --> 1832.28
and I'm gonna try calling mind-warped

1830.54 --> 1835.54
again in a few minutes I hope he didn't

1832.28 --> 1835.54
accidentally fall asleep

1835.66 --> 1840.97
it is night over at his place

1863.59 --> 1870.55
okay Devin good asks a question but I

1866.51 --> 1870.55
wonder who he is asking

1881.15 --> 1891.14
oh it went through your phone okay I'll

1888.26 --> 1894.74
try again or you call me through

1891.14 --> 1898.0590000000002
whatever medium you prefer to call you

1894.74 --> 1898.059
can call me I'll pick up

1928.87 --> 1932.54
[Music]

1941.12 --> 1944.11
all right

1948.84 --> 1952.1799999999998
[Music]

1965.4 --> 1976.2
the topic nothing in particular anything

1969.41 --> 1979.74
the debates the potential unfolding

1976.2 --> 1983.3400000000001
quantum debates all that whatever you

1979.74 --> 1986.19
like that was on your mind if you want

1983.34 --> 1988.6499999999999
to share something your internet right

1986.19 --> 1992.01
now or even if you want to just share a

1988.65 --> 2004.97
video you made or something everything's

1992.01 --> 2007.3
good hey hello the one is young good to

2004.97 --> 2007.3
see you

2017.04 --> 2023.6399999999999
what am I gonna do for Flat Earth this

2019.53 --> 2025.1
year well what I've been doing every

2023.64 --> 2029.99
year

2025.1 --> 2036.87
Craig Fitzgerald take over the world

2029.99 --> 2039.21
no this is but what am I gonna do I'm

2036.87 --> 2043.29
I'm basically gonna continue I'm gonna

2039.21 --> 2047.549
be this or well I don't know what you

2043.29 --> 2049.859
call it he an arbiter a person that's

2047.549 --> 2053.639
been it for long that people can reflect

2049.859 --> 2056.94
upon with information I hope to help

2053.639 --> 2062.4900000000002
people get confusions out of the way

2056.94 --> 2063.57
especially in complex territories that

2062.49 --> 2065.52
yeah

2063.57 --> 2069.2400000000002
that's one of the things I want to do

2065.52 --> 2073.139
for Flat Earth and I want to expand upon

2069.24 --> 2075.99
my concepts work them out is that it's

2073.139 --> 2078.77
just a gradual process really has been

2075.99 --> 2078.77
for a long time

2089.28 --> 2092.28
yeah

2096.27 --> 2106.5
oh [Â __Â ] the moon-landing anniversary

2102.26 --> 2114.42
think something is going to happen there

2106.5 --> 2118.01
might be it could be just who maybe that

2114.42 --> 2120.84
big thing that I've been expecting for

2118.01 --> 2123.3900000000003
years might happen that thing that I

2120.84 --> 2127.56
mentioned that I saw in my vision there

2123.39 --> 2132.42
the revelation the revealing that it was

2127.56 --> 2136.23
all fake that at least like it might be

2132.42 --> 2138.75
like yes it was an act that they might

2136.23 --> 2140.73
actually come out with that but not

2138.75 --> 2143.97
under the guise that the earth may

2140.73 --> 2146.22
actually be flat but like yeah that was

2143.97 --> 2149.0099999999998
fake but we're gonna try again under

2146.22 --> 2151.6499999999996
that guys maybe it's gonna be that but

2149.01 --> 2154.17
no matter what it's gonna turn out to be

2151.65 --> 2157.29
it is gonna create a shockwave no matter

2154.17 --> 2159.15
what if that's gonna happen but I don't

2157.29 --> 2162.48
know if that is actually going to happen

2159.15 --> 2170.1
it would seem fitting it would be kind

2162.48 --> 2172.25
of like a yeah a proper farewell as it

2170.1 --> 2172.25
were

2174.73 --> 2180.19
but I don't know maybe maybe it's just

2178.03 --> 2183.0400000000004
gonna be the same old same old just some

2180.19 --> 2185.32
blah blah blah more stories more oh they

2183.04 --> 2188.65
were so great oh we're Americans are so

2185.32 --> 2191.6800000000003
blah blah we don't know I'm not sure I

2188.65 --> 2194.1600000000003
mean it could be it could be either I

2191.68 --> 2194.16
don't know

2197.46 --> 2203.2
okay mind-warped you want me to try and

2200.859 --> 2211.24
call you again you don't seem to be

2203.2 --> 2214.54
calling me oh come on

2211.24 --> 2216.3999999999996
no you're here right now why can't I

2214.54 --> 2219.21
just call you right now we can talk

2216.4 --> 2219.21
about it right now

2236.94 --> 2243.53
really duck bond what are you doing in

2239.1 --> 2243.5299999999997
chat there then that was the case

2250.44 --> 2258.89
haha mr. zero suck subscribers that's

2255.89 --> 2258.89
hilarious

2263.57 --> 2266.699
[Music]

2267.65 --> 2277.14
they found the tapes oh my god Wow who

2271.92 --> 2280.069
knows the one maybe they did they

2277.14 --> 2282.69
finally work home yeah they were

2280.069 --> 2285.359
confident enough that the technology

2282.69 --> 2287.2200000000003
could put down something that would look

2285.359 --> 2288.7799999999997
original enough in order to fool

2287.22 --> 2292.95
everyone maybe that's it

2288.78 --> 2296.63
who knows maybe but I just have doubts

2292.95 --> 2296.6299999999997
about that I really do

2306.14 --> 2314.299
look maybe the 15th and 50th anniversary

2309.799 --> 2317.989
will like be the official dismantling of

2314.299 --> 2320.029
of NASA or something or the giving up of

2317.989 --> 2322.66
the funds for NASA something like that

2320.029 --> 2329.9
and then it will be kind of like

2322.66 --> 2332.6299999999997
rerouted through other groups like maybe

2329.9 --> 2340.19
Elon Musk is gonna take on more of it

2332.63 --> 2346.009
hey I think I'm being come on

2340.19 --> 2357.619
mind-warped that's not gonna happen okay

2346.009 --> 2359.96
try again tomorrow okay okay sure well

2357.619 --> 2364.359
tomorrow's gonna be Saturday anyway so

2359.96 --> 2364.359
it's potentially much longer show

2365.72 --> 2368.85
[Music]

2398.67 --> 2404.09
all right oh yeah by the way on the

2401.61 --> 2407.6400000000003
debate yesterday before I got into the

2404.09 --> 2410.1000000000004
[Â __Â ] about quantum mechanics I think

2407.64 --> 2412.8799999999997
or was it afterward I don't remember we

2410.1 --> 2416.99
did have a interesting part about

2412.88 --> 2420.32
Rayleigh scattering I figured it out and

2416.99 --> 2423.39
it was funny how there was basically

2420.32 --> 2427.86
just like with Newtonian gravity there

2423.39 --> 2430.74
was no real claim it was just a an

2427.86 --> 2434.9
assumption basically according even to

2430.74 --> 2437.8799999999997
the official sources from what I saw but

2434.9 --> 2439.65
there was a model and this model when I

2437.88 --> 2447.32
looked through it on the debates and it

2439.65 --> 2450.6
was shown it was all based on on the Sun

2447.32 --> 2453.4500000000003
in accordance to its angular position

2450.6 --> 2456.81
and that was what all the data was

2453.45 --> 2460.08
concerned it was literally angular data

2456.81 --> 2465.06
based all of it was amazing

2460.08 --> 2470.64
there was no it was purely optics

2465.06 --> 2475.91
nothing related to any actual mechanical

2470.64 --> 2475.91
effect that has a direct influence on

2476.3 --> 2481.6800000000003
physical distance or locations it was

2479.25 --> 2485.55
purely based on the angles of the

2481.68 --> 2488.64
positions of the Sun that's it this is

2485.55 --> 2490.7400000000002
amazing so that is what their model is

2488.64 --> 2493.17
there it's a yeah they're accurate model

2490.74 --> 2495.72
which supposedly is based on this weird

2493.17 --> 2498.1800000000003
Rayleigh scattering effect but without

2495.72 --> 2503.0899999999997
any proof but the model itself is an

2498.18 --> 2508.71
accurate visual based piece of data

2503.09 --> 2510.8900000000003
Randy called me oh wait I didn't see

2508.71 --> 2510.89
that

2512.839 --> 2515.839
where

2517.369 --> 2551.719
I think you may have called me up in the

2520.46 --> 2554.509
in a different one I'll call you that's

2551.719 --> 2558.7690000000002
good yeah doing good

2554.509 --> 2561.2
oh wait my volume is pretty extreme all

2558.769 --> 2564.6189999999997
of a sudden yeah

2561.2 --> 2568.339
no I'm doing great yeah it's kind of

2564.619 --> 2572.539
stormy today but yeah the the hangouts

2568.339 --> 2575.21
been going great so far I think that's

2572.539 --> 2577.489
like where you live it seems too bad

2575.21 --> 2578.96
that's cool weather to where I live so

2577.489 --> 2581.18
every time you say oh there's a bit of

2578.96 --> 2583.219
wind yeah it's the same air every time

2581.18 --> 2586.969
you say it sunny yes one was out here as

2583.219 --> 2592.039
well weird that well not too weird

2586.969 --> 2595.099
we're basically only part by relatively

2592.039 --> 2597.829
small piece of ocean so however that

2595.099 --> 2600.619
oceans gonna affect the surroundings if

2597.829 --> 2604.3390000000004
we were gonna have similar results

2600.619 --> 2605.9300000000003
basically so it's yeah we're pretty

2604.339 --> 2609.739
angle it's pretty close to the

2605.93 --> 2622.549
Netherlands compared to other regions of

2609.739 --> 2624.41
the world right right anyway yeah I I

2622.549 --> 2625.91
always thought that England and

2624.41 --> 2629.8999999999996
Netherlands were kind of similar in

2625.91 --> 2632.299
climate and if there was big yeah heavy

2629.9 --> 2634.5190000000002
rain in England that there's usually

2632.299 --> 2636.849
would always also be rain in the

2634.519 --> 2640.069
Netherlands and the other way round and

2636.849 --> 2642.2000000000003
if one gets hit with rain then usually

2640.069 --> 2648.4
the other one follows not too long after

2642.2 --> 2650.99
that so but hey how how are you doing

2648.4 --> 2656.63
yeah the

2650.99 --> 2658.22
no new project sorry hmm not too bad had

2656.63 --> 2660.8
another bit of a falling out with John

2658.22 --> 2662.359
last night quantum eraser really I think

2660.8 --> 2666.71
that might all come out to a head soon

2662.359 --> 2668.089
yeah kid can you elaborate a little or

2666.71 --> 2672.64
you want to keep that to yourself

2668.089 --> 2675.92
I'm gonna expose that [Â __Â ] okay

2672.64 --> 2679.99
can you be specific because I have as

2675.92 --> 2679.9900000000002
you well know issues with him but

2681.64 --> 2686.69
psychotic bully of the bullying part

2684.74 --> 2688.52
right right oh yeah I've definitely have

2686.69 --> 2691.88
problems with that but you do recognize

2688.52 --> 2699.619
also that he has been working on it at

2691.88 --> 2700.849
least really yeah really yeah so I guess

2699.619 --> 2702.98
things are gonna come to a head over the

2700.849 --> 2704.839
next couple of days so stay tuned

2702.98 --> 2706.79
because tonight I have my shows and

2704.839 --> 2713.589
there's a very good chance I might be

2706.79 --> 2715.67
exposing exactly all right yes

2713.589 --> 2718.64
it was a very good chance of that

2715.67 --> 2720.89
actually in fact there's almost a 99.9%

2718.64 --> 2724.58
chance of that actually happening okay

2720.89 --> 2727.0989999999997
but is it gonna be based on the content

2724.58 --> 2729.29
or is it gonna be based on his

2727.099 --> 2733.57
background or something oh no on his

2729.29 --> 2736.99
words literally his from his own hand

2733.57 --> 2741.53
right you'll get to see what a conniving

2736.99 --> 2745.04
sniveling arrogant big-headed pigheaded

2741.53 --> 2748.6400000000003
bully that years first time but he

2745.04 --> 2751.19
definitely can be I have experienced

2748.64 --> 2754.19
that firsthand on several occasions but

2751.19 --> 2757.04
he's not always like that it's just when

2754.19 --> 2759.83
you get too close to something that he

2757.04 --> 2763.63
has like honor invested his honor in as

2759.83 --> 2766.359
it were then he starts to get pretty

2763.63 --> 2772.099
psychologically violent all of a sudden

2766.359 --> 2777.16
he's deranged aha a defensive it's he

2772.099 --> 2777.1600000000003
might be what a lot of people would call

2777.339 --> 2784.46
somewhat genius in the way that he

2780.83 --> 2787.549
approaches his analytical side of

2784.46 --> 2791.96
but what comes along with that is this

2787.549 --> 2795.17
rage this uncontrollable anger and rage

2791.96 --> 2797.14
that you can't control and these out of

2795.17 --> 2804.319
order ease out of is out of control

2797.14 --> 2807.3489999999997
literally out of control okay so but but

2804.319 --> 2809.63
why like I don't get it because I have

2807.349 --> 2811.9100000000003
paid attention to him a lot and I kind

2809.63 --> 2813.589
of had to tolerate things about him just

2811.91 --> 2816.71
like he tolerates so many things about

2813.589 --> 2821.0
other people and I do really see that he

2816.71 --> 2823.4900000000002
is doing his best but we please quantum

2821.0 --> 2826.099
eraser I'm sorry but the thing is we're

2823.49 --> 2828.2599999999998
now kind of like engaging in actually

2826.099 --> 2831.079
going there and stepping on his toes

2828.26 --> 2833.779
because we need to because of the

2831.079 --> 2835.46
technical realm that we're gonna touch

2833.779 --> 2839.119
upon with the quantum and light and all

2835.46 --> 2841.64
that and he hates our win and you

2839.119 --> 2844.069
shouldn't do because ultimately you know

2841.64 --> 2846.14
I mean when you go over to Nathan's it's

2844.069 --> 2850.25
like quantum eraser has infested that

2846.14 --> 2852.23
entire channel and you know it's John's

2850.25 --> 2854.869
way or the highway in actual fact it's

2852.23 --> 2856.52
like a takeover of such you know to the

2854.869 --> 2858.529
point where it is the lack of Church now

2856.52 --> 2859.549
and I know that that's been mentioned

2858.529 --> 2862.339
this week too

2859.549 --> 2864.559
or having to put up with his [Â __Â ]

2862.339 --> 2866.869
the way he speaks to people how he is

2864.559 --> 2868.4
you know you shouldn't have to kowtow to

2866.869 --> 2870.26
that you've got your own channel you

2868.4 --> 2872.9300000000003
were around probably longer than he is

2870.26 --> 2875.119
you know you have your own following you

2872.93 --> 2877.339
don't need to go in there and have him

2875.119 --> 2879.7400000000002
talk to you the way that he talks today

2877.339 --> 2884.21
I don't accept that you do take notice

2879.74 --> 2886.1299999999997
that I'm not accepting it right well you

2884.21 --> 2887.96
know I mean I've never been one third

2886.13 --> 2893.119
for bullies I don't like bullies at all

2887.96 --> 2894.829
you know if you start be broke and

2893.119 --> 2897.38
that's what's gonna happen tonight so

2894.829 --> 2899.029
trust me okay he's getting both tonight

2897.38 --> 2903.17
it's all getting out there everyone's

2899.029 --> 2909.74
gonna see what a horrible human being he

2903.17 --> 2911.63
actually is okay okay we'll see yeah he

2909.74 --> 2914.299
definitely does need a bit of a slap on

2911.63 --> 2916.6
the finger it's hard and we'll see what

2914.299 --> 2919.63
happens

2916.6 --> 2923.68
because I do agree to that but I just I

2919.63 --> 2927.37
I think personally that I would be able

2923.68 --> 2930.39
to get everyone to a more constructive

2927.37 --> 2934.15
zone by doing it gradually and basically

2930.39 --> 2936.19
all gradually pushing on John like

2934.15 --> 2938.62
basically addressing his attitude as I

2936.19 --> 2939.37
have been like every time like John shut

2938.62 --> 2940.75
the hell up

2939.37 --> 2943.0299999999997
you're a rhombic saying that kind of

2940.75 --> 2946.39
thing but doing it for real and not like

2943.03 --> 2948.6400000000003
right hand like yeah because that's only

2946.39 --> 2952.0
gonna actually trigger everything more

2948.64 --> 2955.0299999999997
but just bang be very strict direct

2952.0 --> 2958.03
basically what John is doing himself but

2955.03 --> 2962.71
in a responsible way and that way I

2958.03 --> 2966.5800000000004
think that he can over time kind of be

2962.71 --> 2968.53
corrected at it as it were by his own

2966.58 --> 2973.0299999999997
choice with some assistance but yeah

2968.53 --> 2979.0
with this full-on assault I don't know I

2973.03 --> 2981.6000000000004
don't know what's gonna happen maybe I'm

2979.0 --> 2984.58
just being too optimistic about him I

2981.6 --> 2987.13
just I've just noticed that he does have

2984.58 --> 2989.77
moments of progress that's all and but

2987.13 --> 2992.9500000000003
he still always fault does fall back at

2989.77 --> 2995.38
times of pressure into that nasty

2992.95 --> 2999.52
behavior I can't deny that that that is

2995.38 --> 3002.01
true the amount of times I have been

2999.52 --> 3003.21
able to say okay okay well I got

3002.01 --> 3004.98
something wrong there you know it's not

3003.21 --> 3006.18
a problem well you know I'll apologize

3004.98 --> 3008.52
for that we'll move forward you know

3006.18 --> 3018.8599999999997
let's bring it back on track you know

3008.52 --> 3018.86
it's not a big a bad thing in anybody

3019.1 --> 3027.569
your sound is muffled and the connection

3024.57 --> 3031.7090000000003
is constantly breaking up as well

3027.569 --> 3034.17
so yeah so is it's not it's you know if

3031.709 --> 3036.93
it's in somebody's character to just be

3034.17 --> 3039.569
to refuse to acknowledge when they're

3036.93 --> 3043.43
wrong you know that's really bad treyton

3039.569 --> 3048.0589999999997
somebody you know and with John that is

3043.43 --> 3052.6189999999997
yep I agree you know I agree that is

3048.059 --> 3053.1600000000003
it's part of his his ball and chain as

3052.619 --> 3056.009
it were

3053.16 --> 3058.319
it's his issue his ego issue but I do

3056.009 --> 3063.239
think that he is kind of slowly trying

3058.319 --> 3065.3089999999997
to work on it genuinely but still yeah

3063.239 --> 3066.869
it is like a big character problem with

3065.309 --> 3071.549
him and but he kind of admits that

3066.869 --> 3073.049
though so I well I've given him the

3071.549 --> 3075.599
option to admit that he's wrong and he

3073.049 --> 3078.329
won't so [Â __Â ] him he thinks he's gonna

3075.599 --> 3080.759
go on ball-busters and expose me by

3078.329 --> 3083.67
blatantly lying about me which I will

3080.759 --> 3085.079
expose tonight by blatantly lying he

3083.67 --> 3087.69
thinks he's gonna go1 ball-busters

3085.079 --> 3091.529
tomorrow and call me out who do you

3087.69 --> 3097.7690000000002
consult my big fat bollocks goody more

3091.529 --> 3100.829
infighting he's trying to do is he's

3097.769 --> 3103.859
trying to force a wedge between people

3100.829 --> 3105.8390000000004
so that he can have full control of the

3103.859 --> 3109.109
show and that's what he's doing

3105.839 --> 3111.39
yeah but he's always kind of done that

3109.109 --> 3114.209
that's what I said as soon as you start

3111.39 --> 3117.65
to thread on his toes on the area that's

3114.209 --> 3120.839
very close to what what is his

3117.65 --> 3123.869
self-worth as it were to him then he

3120.839 --> 3126.749
starts to basically yeah shame you and

3123.869 --> 3129.239
put you put you in the clown zone and

3126.749 --> 3131.1899999999996
everything yeah well I'm not to be

3129.239 --> 3132.479
pushed over I'm not like that he can do

3131.19 --> 3133.859
that with other people but he's not

3132.479 --> 3136.319
gonna get away with doing that [Â __Â ]

3133.859 --> 3138.5989999999997
all doing mmm well we can't get away

3136.319 --> 3140.999
with me doing that either and it's up to

3138.599 --> 3144.4790000000003
Nathan and yeah if Nathan mutes me then

3140.999 --> 3146.3689999999997
nobody gets to hear it but I damn well

3144.479 --> 3148.019
when he does that [Â __Â ] to me I basically

3146.369 --> 3150.089
throw it right back in his face and

3148.019 --> 3152.1899999999996
start to name everything that he's just

3150.089 --> 3155.279
literally done in the last few minutes

3152.19 --> 3158.93
incorrectly that kind of [Â __Â ] I have my

3155.279 --> 3160.7
own back assault in response you know

3158.93 --> 3163.7599999999998
but

3160.7 --> 3165.799
I get it not a lot of people after that

3163.76 --> 3170.119
point are willing to just communicate

3165.799 --> 3174.5
with him ever again I'm just used to the

3170.119 --> 3179.96
high intensity arguments with people I

3174.5 --> 3181.49
know well I better get back I just

3179.96 --> 3185.48
thought I'd feel a bit of time and you

3181.49 --> 3188.839
know last time uh me lunch yeah and you

3185.48 --> 3190.91
know I knew you needed a guess India

3188.839 --> 3192.92
yeah much appreciated thank you for

3190.91 --> 3195.6499999999996
coming on and sharing giving us a for

3192.92 --> 3198.349
look for what's gonna go on down on

3195.65 --> 3202.549
flatter seen in the Flat Earth debates

3198.349 --> 3204.92
and the Francey roundtable so I would

3202.549 --> 3206.47
rather I would listen I would rather not

3204.92 --> 3208.88
have this in fire and I wouldn't even

3206.47 --> 3210.68
address it but when somebody

3208.88 --> 3212.779
specifically comes out and says that

3210.68 --> 3215.269
they're going to expose me on blow on

3212.779 --> 3218.779
ball busters tomorrow when he's the

3215.269 --> 3220.7299999999996
warmness absolutely 1000% in the [Â __Â ]

3218.779 --> 3222.44
wrong there's no way I'm gonna have him

3220.73 --> 3224.63
create a narrative easier cherry-picking

3222.44 --> 3227.63
with [Â __Â ] [Â __Â ] and I'm going to

3224.63 --> 3230.329
expose that tonight trust me okay right

3227.63 --> 3235.4300000000003
I'm going yeah I wish you the best of

3230.329 --> 3237.619
luck I hope I hope ranty is gonna get

3235.43 --> 3240.8289999999997
somewhere because I think that key we

3237.619 --> 3245.21
can do this persistently on a high

3240.829 --> 3249.049
energy level keep it up for a very long

3245.21 --> 3251.75
time like he's not gonna tire out too

3249.049 --> 3254.48
quickly and he's he's pretty relentless

3251.75 --> 3258.71
so I wonder where this will go with

3254.48 --> 3261.41
Randy now Randy is not very mad he's

3258.71 --> 3264.14
just pissed off because he feels the

3261.41 --> 3269.69
injustice of the situation and I kind of

3264.14 --> 3272.359
agree with it but I personally don't

3269.69 --> 3275.15
think this course of action really is

3272.359 --> 3277.94
that effective yes it forces a change

3275.15 --> 3281.75
but the results of those change might

3277.94 --> 3284.119
not be as good as you hope for but we'll

3281.75 --> 3286.309
see what happens Randy is making his

3284.119 --> 3289.4900000000002
choice and we'll see what it will come

3286.309 --> 3292.009
out of it so I have very little say

3289.49 --> 3294.4399999999996
about it in the matter besides what I

3292.009 --> 3296.829
have been saying so far so oh yeah

3294.44 --> 3300.56
by the way thanks Dave Jeffords for the

3296.829 --> 3307.4
$1 99 super chair donation let God be

3300.56 --> 3313.4
true and every man be a liar don't

3307.4 --> 3317.81
particularly like it but yeah I guess

3313.4 --> 3321.29
God is true and I guess that through man

3317.81 --> 3324.109
God can also speak and be true and

3321.29 --> 3328.819
that's how we recognize it but a man can

3324.109 --> 3331.31
also lie but anyway thank you for the

3328.819 --> 3339.74
for the super donation much appreciate

3331.31 --> 3343.19
it yeah I'm gonna round out the show I

3339.74 --> 3345.7
think pretty soon did start a little

3343.19 --> 3345.7000000000003
late though

3350.0 --> 3357.69
hmm yeah chocolate Sena I know cuz I

3355.079 --> 3361.53
think it may be the New Yorker thing

3357.69 --> 3364.05
does have something to do with the level

3361.53 --> 3366.51
of intensity you get used to when

3364.05 --> 3368.4900000000002
dealing socially with people because if

3366.51 --> 3370.8900000000003
you're constantly confronted with people

3368.49 --> 3372.839
going nuts towards one another and

3370.89 --> 3375.359
passion it out in the open and getting

3372.839 --> 3381.5099999999998
in fights yeah you get used to that [Â __Â ]

3375.359 --> 3383.7599999999998
and look my we were always bickering in

3381.51 --> 3385.8900000000003
my family like my dad and my mother

3383.76 --> 3387.96
ended up eventually like always

3385.89 --> 3390.06
bickering I was bickering a lot with

3387.96 --> 3394.38
everyone including my brother and them

3390.06 --> 3396.54
and so I'm just used to that intensity

3394.38 --> 3400.77
of engagement I don't pursue it

3396.54 --> 3403.98
neurotically but I'm just I can handle

3400.77 --> 3407.359
that without a huge burden necessary and

3403.98 --> 3407.359
that's necessarily so

3418.79 --> 3429.98
thoughts on QE saying elevation date

3422.69 --> 3437.78
proves earth is flat fashion date hmm

3429.98 --> 3439.95
well it would be empirical optics based

3437.78 --> 3442.4100000000003
geometrical deduction so it's not

3439.95 --> 3447.54
scientific proof but yeah yeah

3442.41 --> 3449.3999999999996
definitely that yeah it's not scientific

3447.54 --> 3452.99
proof because it's impossible but I

3449.4 --> 3452.9900000000002
would definitely agree to that

3455.72 --> 3460.25
hey thanks Amanda um by the way

3471.13 --> 3478.4
yeah bill gee you know what

3474.229 --> 3483.049
in a way John always like claims the

3478.4 --> 3487.789
dominance on the show he doesn't he he

3483.049 --> 3490.43
refuses to take it on a one-to-one level

3487.789 --> 3494.539
on an equal level on an equal footing it

3490.43 --> 3499.969
is it's called I think so yeah that that

3494.539 --> 3502.5490000000004
is true and that is annoying when he's

3499.969 --> 3505.7290000000003
in a interruptive or dominant or angry

3502.549 --> 3508.009
mood so in a way it would be good to

3505.729 --> 3509.45
have him basically take his step back

3508.009 --> 3512.2690000000002
but that's up to Nathan and I don't

3509.45 --> 3515.239
think Nathan likes that I think Nathan

3512.269 --> 3519.729
likes to take cover on their Jones

3515.239 --> 3523.7490000000003
authority as it were because then he he

3519.729 --> 3530.479
there's light is it it's like having a

3523.749 --> 3534.0789999999997
deflect a deflector somebody that'll

3530.479 --> 3536.6299999999997
deflect some of this standard attacks as

3534.079 --> 3539.059
it were people will get more worked up

3536.63 --> 3540.92
about John than about Nathan when John's

3539.059 --> 3544.849
around maybe that is it I don't know

3540.92 --> 3547.299
what Nathan maybe Nathan just taking it

3544.849 --> 3552.699
slowly and he really doesn't really mind

3547.299 --> 3552.699
he doesn't see the issue I don't know

3552.759 --> 3558.729
but we'll see where it goes anyway I

3556.519 --> 3562.0089999999996
haven't gone around out the show now so

3558.729 --> 3563.8999999999996
