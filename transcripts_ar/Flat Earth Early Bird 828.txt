166.08 --> 169.20000000000002
out about the sound

169.599 --> 172.72
very happy about that

173.36 --> 179.84
i'm trying to adjust the volume somewhat

176.64 --> 182.23899999999998
to get a little higher up but it's kind

179.84 --> 184.64000000000001
of difficult

182.239 --> 186.56
see maybe this is good let's see how

184.64 --> 189.599
this would do

186.56 --> 192.64000000000001
you low right

189.599 --> 194.159
ah right first time it's passing that

192.64 --> 197.92
mark

194.159 --> 201.28
let's just put it down to 160 percent

197.92 --> 201.28
that should be good for now

208.4 --> 212.08
i don't know tom parker i don't i don't

211.68 --> 214.87900000000002

217.28 --> 222.4
i do know that a good servant at least

221.2 --> 226.0
kind of like

222.4 --> 226.4
stepped away he's figured it out at

226.0 --> 229.92
least

226.4 --> 229.92000000000002
glad glad to hear that

233.04 --> 236.4
but yeah no doubt he's going to be out

235.12 --> 241.20000000000002
there and he's going to be

236.4 --> 243.76000000000002
just being doing what he does

241.2 --> 244.319
slandering people being all conspirators

243.76 --> 247.439
about

244.319 --> 250.79899999999998
secret intentions and secret double

247.439 --> 255.28
agendas and all that nonsense so just

250.799 --> 258.72
let him squirt it doesn't really matter

like i have to get rid of it quickly

334.88 --> 340.0
and with yeah some regular support

338.0 --> 341.52
through paypal i might be able to do it

340.0 --> 352.08
without getting

341.52 --> 355.039
big fines right making it even worse so

352.08 --> 355.039
all right so the

355.6 --> 361.6
the low cannabis use is working out

358.8 --> 362.639
it's working out great i i dramatically

361.6 --> 365.28000000000003
cut down

362.639 --> 368.08
i haven't completely stopped yet kind of

365.28 --> 370.08
started micro dosing

368.08 --> 372.96
and then realized oh wait this is actual

370.08 --> 375.12
normal dosing

372.96 --> 377.28
but not even throughout the entire day

375.12 --> 381.12
that's a bigger part of it

377.28 --> 384.479
just i leave it for certain moments

381.12 --> 385.36
and kind of like well rolls my own

384.479 --> 388.24
cigarettes

385.36 --> 388.24
in other times

388.96 --> 395.84
and it's working out so far actually

391.919 --> 395.84
kind of cleared me up a little

395.919 --> 402.4
uh so i'm very happy about that

399.52 --> 404.08
right also slightly excited because

402.4 --> 406.15999999999997

409.84 --> 413.039
and actually report

413.759 --> 418.96000000000004
the thing that happened uh

417.199 --> 421.039
one and a half week ago right now in the

418.96 --> 423.52
weekend

421.039 --> 425.039
took long enough to get that appointment

423.52 --> 427.44

425.039 --> 430.24

430.24 --> 434.319
and uh yeah the day after gunk to go to

432.56 --> 437.84
uh

434.319 --> 437.84000000000003

440.96 --> 446.23999999999995
like after my show

443.68 --> 450.08
so yeah i'm kind of excited about that

446.24 --> 452.319
and i do have a good feeling

450.08 --> 455.19899999999996
what happened abandoned what you don't

452.319 --> 457.03900000000004
know oh god

455.199 --> 459.039
i don't know if i want to go through all

457.039 --> 461.52
of it it's just my landlord's giving me

459.039 --> 464.15999999999997
a lot of hassle and he's

461.52 --> 466.71999999999997
like trying to build some kind of a case

464.16 --> 468.8
to work me out of the room

466.72 --> 470.0
even though i have tenant rights and

468.8 --> 473.84000000000003
i've literally

470.0 --> 476.24
not done anything noteworthy

473.84 --> 477.919
to be able to get him to do that he's

476.24 --> 478.24
just trying to kind of peer pressure me

477.919 --> 480.479
out

478.24 --> 482.16
and i need judicial support for that and

480.479 --> 483.599
there was a bit of a hassle getting it

482.16 --> 486.879
at first because the

483.599 --> 489.52
standard office to go to was closed due

486.879 --> 495.44
to corona so

489.52 --> 495.44
but it's all taken care of pretty much

495.84 --> 507.84
and i'll know more after this thursday

514.09 --> 517.3090000000001
[Music]

518.839 --> 521.839
right

522.399 --> 526.159
so are you guys enjoying the layout

526.16 --> 537.519
what do you think amanda

534.8 --> 538.959
anything new with robin stan no now that

537.519 --> 540.399
you mentioned i haven't heard from her

538.959 --> 548.8
in a while again

540.399 --> 551.92
but she's a very busy lady

548.8 --> 552.7199999999999
she's probably trying to figure out how

551.92 --> 554.959
to kind of

552.72 --> 554.9590000000001
well

556.56 --> 560.7199999999999
undo the situation that unrolled some i

559.36 --> 563.279
don't know exactly what she's doing

560.72 --> 566.32
whether she's trying to get a new job or

563.279 --> 569.8389999999999
trying to basically get judicial

566.32 --> 572.72
assistance to unravel

569.839 --> 573.44
the crazy situation that led to her

572.72 --> 575.6
basically

573.44 --> 577.839
basically losing that job which didn't

575.6 --> 580.5600000000001
make any freaking sense

577.839 --> 583.44
technically i don't know exactly but she

580.56 --> 586.64
was in a bit of a

583.44 --> 591.839
a downturn last time

586.64 --> 591.8389999999999
and i hope it's working out i really do

592.0 --> 595.839
but i haven't heard from her in a while

597.04 --> 602.3199999999999
i hope you're doing okay robin stanley

599.76 --> 605.519
please let me know

602.32 --> 619.839
through skype

605.519 --> 619.839
ah glad you like it amanda young

624.72 --> 629.12
right tom parker well she's not just a

626.56 --> 633.8389999999999
sweet lady she's also a very strong lady

629.12 --> 633.839
like really strong

636.399 --> 640.0
like i'm very impressed by her

644.839 --> 651.7600000000001
what it restricts you from moving

648.8 --> 653.5999999999999
very notch very much yeah a little aaron

651.76 --> 656.3199999999999
armstrong

653.6 --> 657.839
but there there might be some

656.32 --> 660.9590000000001
modification

657.839 --> 663.2
in the near future i'm just kind of not

660.959 --> 665.8389999999999
focusing on it right now since i have

663.2 --> 669.2
other things on my heart and mind

665.839 --> 671.44
but eventually i'll figure out like how

669.2 --> 674.8000000000001
to get my maneuverability back

671.44 --> 677.36
this is and i've been dressed

674.8 --> 677.3599999999999
with adam

679.2 --> 685.0400000000001
but for now this is just great i like it

682.16 --> 689.8389999999999
it looks really cool

685.04 --> 689.8389999999999
even though it's a little restricting

697.76 --> 701.04
right yeah yesterday man yesterday was

700.48 --> 704.88
really

701.04 --> 704.88
uh a troll day it seems

705.2 --> 709.0400000000001
i watched back that part when simon dan

707.2 --> 711.519
came in like i really gave him

709.04 --> 714.16
i gave him a good whooping but he

711.519 --> 714.16
deserved it

714.88 --> 718.48
i wonder if it if it got to him because

717.44 --> 722.32
what i said was

718.48 --> 723.76
was really serious i said it kind of

722.32 --> 726.5600000000001
like in a

723.76 --> 727.279
well with a slight sadistic tone in it

726.56 --> 730.56
because

727.279 --> 734.48
i can't stand the guy for

730.56 --> 737.68
yeah before for the mentioned reasons

734.48 --> 737.6800000000001
during that process

737.92 --> 744.88
but yeah i always use the truth

741.839 --> 746.8000000000001
to slap people in the face with

744.88 --> 748.8
then whether they take it as a personal

746.8 --> 749.76
insult and ignore it or whether they

748.8 --> 752.8
actually

749.76 --> 758.56
listen start to think about it that's up

752.8 --> 761.04
to them

758.56 --> 762.7199999999999
yeah i know tara 306 i know he watches

761.04 --> 765.12
me every day because

762.72 --> 768.72
he's kind of jealous that i do this

765.12 --> 768.72
every day and that i keep it up

770.639 --> 774.0790000000001
like he wouldn't know what to do on a

773.12 --> 777.12
daily show

774.079 --> 779.519
at all like at all

777.12 --> 780.399
so he's like intrigued that i do it and

779.519 --> 783.12
he

780.399 --> 786.079
yeah so it's funny you know he

783.12 --> 789.12
supposedly has so much

786.079 --> 791.92
all the big channel all the big support

789.12 --> 792.32
but he doesn't have what i have and that

791.92 --> 796.3199999999999
is

792.32 --> 800.24
a mission and a dedication

796.32 --> 803.279
and a long-term goal and a project

800.24 --> 806.0790000000001
a a public project of myself

803.279 --> 807.2
and psychoanalysis of myself and

806.079 --> 809.68
everything else

807.2 --> 811.2
he doesn't have all that so yeah that

809.68 --> 813.3599999999999
that's gonna be tough to have a daily

811.2 --> 815.839
show then simon and i get it

813.36 --> 817.36
right it's not gonna work out for you

815.839 --> 821.44
unless

817.36 --> 826.32
you actually start

821.44 --> 829.2790000000001
learning stuff right

826.32 --> 830.48
so if you want some material for your

829.279 --> 832.959
shows

830.48 --> 834.72
you got to do things you got to learn

832.959 --> 835.4399999999999
things and then maybe share what you

834.72 --> 838.72
learn

835.44 --> 839.1990000000001
you know it's it's even how i don't know

838.72 --> 841.6800000000001
more

839.199 --> 844.16
professional baller channels out there

841.68 --> 846.16
and astrophysicist that's what they do

844.16 --> 847.68
they look into things they figure out

846.16 --> 849.12
something new and then they share what

847.68 --> 851.279
they learned that's

849.12 --> 854.32
yeah whether it's based on nonsense or

851.279 --> 857.36
not it doesn't really matter to that

854.32 --> 861.1990000000001
you got to keep on learning

857.36 --> 861.1990000000001
and making new material

861.6 --> 864.32
right so

867.68 --> 871.8389999999999
a tiny wumble

876.32 --> 879.9200000000001
all right what happened to good servant

878.079 --> 884.6389999999999
aaron armstrong uh well

879.92 --> 886.8
we had we've kind of had a history

884.639 --> 887.76
there were some very serious clashes at

886.8 --> 890.24
times

887.76 --> 892.3199999999999
he kind of i felt like he turned against

890.24 --> 894.48
me and he had a weird like

892.32 --> 896.1600000000001
i don't know christ complex in the

894.48 --> 898.399
moment or something and he thought he

896.16 --> 901.279
was doing a secret mission for christ or

898.399 --> 901.279
something weird

901.44 --> 906.0
and then he went over to tony's to try

904.399 --> 908.32
and achieve that somehow

906.0 --> 910.639
but yeah yeah surprise surprise that

908.32 --> 913.1990000000001
didn't work out

910.639 --> 914.399
and i i told him that at the moment he

913.199 --> 917.04
went there pretty much

914.399 --> 918.32
but he didn't listen but he's he's

917.04 --> 922.079
figured it out and

918.32 --> 922.0790000000001
i don't know he comes by still

922.399 --> 925.44
but not as much as more he is not as

924.48 --> 928.5600000000001
fanatical and

925.44 --> 930.24
in a way i'm kind of glad of it because

928.56 --> 934.16
i think it would be better for him to

930.24 --> 934.16
just have his own platform

935.12 --> 938.9590000000001
because over here that's not really

937.12 --> 939.6
going to be it he's never going to be

938.959 --> 941.5999999999999
like a

939.6 --> 943.759
co-show host and i think that is kind of

941.6 --> 946.9590000000001
what he originally wanted

943.759 --> 950.0
and that's just not going to happen like

946.959 --> 953.8389999999999
i'm not going to have a standard co-host

950.0 --> 957.279
which tony tony starmah amanda young

953.839 --> 961.519
not not sleeping warrior tony

957.279 --> 969.8389999999999
it's the guy that's super safanye dark

961.519 --> 969.839
that guy no aaron armstrong not riley

981.92 --> 986.399
right i don't even know how for how long

984.399 --> 989.68
he's been around on youtube but

986.399 --> 993.199
first came to my attention in

989.68 --> 995.4399999999999
october last year that's when he first

993.199 --> 996.24
came on my radar i don't know what he's

995.44 --> 999.519
been doing before

996.24 --> 1001.6800000000001
all that don't really care that much

999.519 --> 1004.639
but anthony riley has been around for a

1001.68 --> 1004.6389999999999
long long time

1005.199 --> 1011.8389999999999
since the early days of the flat earth

1006.88 --> 1011.8389999999999
debate like three or four years ago

1012.32 --> 1017.1990000000001
is it 2017 really yeah yeah

1022.839 --> 1025.839
ah

1036.799 --> 1040.72
yes amanda young i know i i don't really

1039.919 --> 1043.199
follow it

1040.72 --> 1044.88
though i'll be honest about that

1043.199 --> 1047.1200000000001
although i have nothing

1044.88 --> 1049.3600000000001
directly against him it's just not my

1047.12 --> 1049.36
thing

1050.08 --> 1056.32
i'm already spread out thin enough with

1052.24 --> 1056.32
my attention as to what is out there

1063.2 --> 1069.039
don't use the man rovinson helmets you

1065.6 --> 1069.039
mean anthony riley

1069.76 --> 1072.559
he is pretty cool

1076.4 --> 1080.64

conspiracy cats talking about

1172.24 --> 1178.24
ghost sounds and [ __ ] ghost stories

1176.64 --> 1180.0800000000002

brandon toy he gave his channel to

1180.08 --> 1193.84
brandon toy that's right

1181.36 --> 1193.84
thanks aaron armstrong

1194.96 --> 1200.0
why i don't know why because he was sick

1197.52 --> 1203.44
of it he didn't want to do it anymore

1200.0 --> 1206.64
i don't know man i didn't ask him

1203.44 --> 1207.2
he popped by a while ago in my chat

1206.64 --> 1210.3200000000002
though

1207.2 --> 1212.96
to say hello so he's still like doing

1210.32 --> 1212.96
some stuff

1215.039 --> 1221.84
he's just not really a regular youtuber

1217.76 --> 1221.84
anymore as he used to be

1222.64 --> 1227.1200000000001
hey hello chris lajambe

1232.159 --> 1236.0800000000002
okay iron armstrong if you say if you

1234.559 --> 1240.32
say so

1236.08 --> 1240.32
it's pretty good i haven't seen any

1244.48 --> 1250.72
page love i don't know do you mean

1248.08 --> 1252.0
the page the page that also like to hang

1250.72 --> 1255.039
around in

1252.0 --> 1255.039
randy's panel

1255.76 --> 1261.679
i don't know where she's at

1258.88 --> 1262.159
i think a lot of them just moved on to i

1261.679 --> 1265.039
don't know

1262.159 --> 1267.0390000000002
discord channels and other places i

1265.039 --> 1269.679
don't know where they're at

1267.039 --> 1270.64
i haven't really seen much of ranty's

1269.679 --> 1273.1200000000001
following like

1270.64 --> 1273.919
pop back in here or over at the flat of

1273.12 --> 1275.1999999999998
the base but

1273.919 --> 1277.2800000000002
they're probably hanging around

1275.2 --> 1279.1200000000001
somewhere on discord you know a lot of

1277.28 --> 1281.76
these people have their own discord

1279.12 --> 1291.84
channels now

1281.76 --> 1291.84
just doing stuff

1297.44 --> 1300.48
but she's a fan girl of beth okay yeah

1300.0 --> 1303.6
aaron

1300.48 --> 1306.48
that makes sense because beth then it

1303.6 --> 1308.6399999999999
then paige might be hanging around in

1306.48 --> 1310.08
discord at the uh

1308.64 --> 1312.88
where bev is also hanging around what's

1310.08 --> 1312.8799999999999
his name again uh

1313.52 --> 1319.84
wait let me open discord to check it out

1320.96 --> 1323.76
what's that again

1325.679 --> 1330.88
yeah am i uk on miuk server i think

1328.4 --> 1332.64
they're hanging around over there

1330.88 --> 1334.4
i remember if i remember correctly

1332.64 --> 1338.72
that's where i last saw

1334.4 --> 1338.72
paige so

1339.76 --> 1347.84
yeah that's it

1348.159 --> 1353.2800000000002
he's an embarrassment to australians why

1350.96 --> 1353.28
is

1355.6 --> 1375.84
huge echo chamber oh that could be

1360.96 --> 1375.8400000000001
i don't know

1392.72 --> 1396.64
yeah i mean i don't know why erin

1394.799 --> 1399.12
armstrong says she's an environment

1396.64 --> 1403.2
embarrassment to australians like okay

1399.12 --> 1406.2399999999998
she gets a little impulsive sometimes

1403.2 --> 1410.159
but an embarrassment i don't

1406.24 --> 1410.159
really think so it's not that bad

1411.12 --> 1415.6789999999999
and she really does mean the best you

1413.919 --> 1417.3600000000001
know she's really doing her best that's

1415.679 --> 1419.2800000000002
what i noticed from her every time

1417.36 --> 1421.279
but she does get caught up in things and

1419.28 --> 1422.24
she can get a little impulsive sometimes

1421.279 --> 1424.159
but

1422.24 --> 1431.52
yeah i don't know why aaron armstrong is

1424.159 --> 1432.64
all embarrassed she's vile oh right well

1431.52 --> 1436.32
another

1432.64 --> 1439.8400000000001
assertion there how how she

1436.32 --> 1442.08
vile eren armstrong you can't just sling

1439.84 --> 1445.84
around these words without some actual

1442.08 --> 1445.84
backup for it

1456.32 --> 1459.84
so please explain yourself

1478.72 --> 1482.72
you want for me to type it up well why

1480.88 --> 1487.8400000000001
don't you give me a summary what makes

1482.72 --> 1487.84
her so vile

1489.84 --> 1494.3999999999999
like i don't know like how far she went

1492.24 --> 1496.08
maybe she has like really serious rage

1494.4 --> 1500.3200000000002
moments or whatever

1496.08 --> 1500.8799999999999
well hey there's a few moments where i

1500.32 --> 1504.3999999999999
do too

1500.88 --> 1504.4
does that make me vile

1507.2 --> 1510.88
am i vile because i have some moments

1509.12 --> 1512.559
where i get really pissed off

1510.88 --> 1515.8400000000001
and basically don't know how to hold

1512.559 --> 1515.84
back anymore

1531.76 --> 1535.279
all right well there you go cameron

1533.44 --> 1537.44
kamikaze give more thanks for the paypal

1535.279 --> 1537.76
donation by the way i really appreciate

1537.44 --> 1543.8400000000001
that

1537.76 --> 1543.84
thank you so much it's really helping

1549.279 --> 1556.0
oh she lies lies about what

1553.2 --> 1557.3600000000001
she always plays the victim oh there

1556.0 --> 1560.4
that habit

1557.36 --> 1564.0
i would agree is a bit annoying she does

1560.4 --> 1567.44
do that sometimes it's a bad trait

1564.0 --> 1568.0
but it's not always at least not the

1567.44 --> 1569.679
last

1568.0 --> 1571.12
few times that i've watched i don't know

1569.679 --> 1574.159
i haven't really kept

1571.12 --> 1577.279
track of her in like over a year i don't

1574.159 --> 1577.279
know what she's like right now

1581.2 --> 1584.96
right well aaron armstrong it doesn't

1583.279 --> 1587.44
really work if you're gonna say

1584.96 --> 1588.4
let's just move on after you say she's

1587.44 --> 1590.3200000000002
really vile

1588.4 --> 1593.6000000000001
and an embarrassment that doesn't work

1590.32 --> 1593.6
that way right

1594.32 --> 1598.32
can't just move on after making an

1596.24 --> 1599.76
accusation like that to somebody that a

1598.32 --> 1603.9189999999999
lot of people know

1599.76 --> 1603.919
right that's not how communication works

1606.08 --> 1609.9189999999999
you've barely watched her so you can't

1607.919 --> 1610.24
comment well i've been in hangouts with

1609.919 --> 1612.0800000000002
her

1610.24 --> 1614.559
aaron armstrong a lot of the time a lot

1612.08 --> 1614.559
of times

1616.559 --> 1622.8799999999999
i'm 100 sure but i think she was even

1620.08 --> 1622.8799999999999
on my show

1623.6 --> 1628.559
a time i don't remember exactly if

1626.559 --> 1640.72
that's the case

1628.559 --> 1644.48
but yeah

1640.72 --> 1644.48

you know look if she

1690.72 --> 1693.76
look everybody even ballers can get in

1693.44 --> 1695.44
here

1693.76 --> 1697.52
ask questions you know it's just that

1695.44 --> 1699.8400000000001
most people just don't do it

1697.52 --> 1700.9189999999999
and they just end up oh let's ask

1699.84 --> 1706.32
something

1700.919 --> 1709.3600000000001
non-personal about something out there

1706.32 --> 1711.9189999999999
but yeah people can ask me to

1709.36 --> 1712.559
analyze things about them personal

1711.919 --> 1715.76
advice

1712.559 --> 1719.12
if they dare i do that i'll do it for

1715.76 --> 1722.24
free and i even end up doing it

1719.12 --> 1723.9189999999999
for free right here on the show against

1722.24 --> 1724.88
certain individuals that think they're

1723.919 --> 1728.24
really smart

1724.88 --> 1731.679
and [ __ ] like simon dan

1728.24 --> 1735.6
i'm technically giving him advice

1731.679 --> 1738.96
really oh you think it's trolling

1735.6 --> 1740.7199999999998
okay that that's your prerogative you

1738.96 --> 1741.279
can think it's trolling but if you

1740.72 --> 1744.64
really

1741.279 --> 1745.2
listen carefully then you'll figure out

1744.64 --> 1749.3600000000001
that

1745.2 --> 1754.159
there is actual advisatory

1749.36 --> 1754.1589999999999
value in the things that i say

1756.48 --> 1761.6
even when i'm reacting harshly to

1759.12 --> 1761.6
somebody

1764.96 --> 1771.3600000000001
oh yeah yeah jm uh laylor

1768.799 --> 1773.36
thank you welcome to the chat yes i

1771.36 --> 1776.4799999999998
didn't even get to the notes

1773.36 --> 1779.9189999999999
but yes i did go on 24 7 again

1776.48 --> 1780.24
was quite active there and it yesterday

1779.919 --> 1783.1200000000001
was

1780.24 --> 1783.1200000000001
very interesting

1785.52 --> 1792.399
so first off yes i finally

1788.96 --> 1794.3990000000001
watched owen benjamin live stream again

1792.399 --> 1796.6399999999999
unfortunately though his channel did not

1794.399 --> 1800.7199999999998
have a chat

1796.64 --> 1803.1200000000001
so there yeah he has he said

1800.72 --> 1804.48
that you can chat during his live stream

1803.12 --> 1808.399
on telegram

1804.48 --> 1810.96
well i have telegram i tried to find him

1808.399 --> 1812.1589999999999
through everything he said and i

1810.96 --> 1814.72
couldn't find

1812.159 --> 1815.679
the live chat at all was a little

1814.72 --> 1819.1200000000001
confusing

1815.679 --> 1821.039
but i think that maybe what i eventually

1819.12 --> 1822.8799999999999
figured out i think

1821.039 --> 1824.8799999999999
if i remember correctly is that he that

1822.88 --> 1828.0
you have to have the special app now

1824.88 --> 1837.1200000000001
to do that so it's probably paid to chat

1828.0 --> 1839.44
in a very direct sense

1837.12 --> 1841.1999999999998
but yeah it was good the live stream he

1839.44 --> 1843.679
did was really

1841.2 --> 1844.24
cool it was really nice to hear it just

1843.679 --> 1847.1200000000001
from

1844.24 --> 1847.1200000000001
beginning to end

1848.0 --> 1854.399
you need an invite to the chat

1852.0 --> 1855.84
oh okay clutch bear could could you

1854.399 --> 1861.1999999999998
invite me

1855.84 --> 1861.1999999999998
or is it only big bear that invites

1862.84 --> 1868.08
people

1865.6 --> 1868.08
i don't know

1873.76 --> 1877.679
i did join because i don't have what oh

1876.96 --> 1880.559
didn't join

1877.679 --> 1881.919
right right okay well i have telegram i

1880.559 --> 1884.48
already used it for

1881.919 --> 1887.919
communications with other people

1884.48 --> 1891.039
concerning the gti

1887.919 --> 1893.8400000000001
company and all so i already had it

1891.039 --> 1893.84
anyway

1897.519 --> 1901.519
it would be pretty cool if i could get

1899.519 --> 1906.96
an infight

1901.519 --> 1909.1200000000001
but oh well i i can survive without it

1906.96 --> 1910.72
it's just that i do kind of miss like

1909.12 --> 1912.559
the quick

1910.72 --> 1914.159
there's a lot of brain activity that

1912.559 --> 1916.24
goes on

1914.159 --> 1917.519
when i can be in chat with somebody

1916.24 --> 1920.559
that's just

1917.519 --> 1922.0
really high energy and really smart like

1920.559 --> 1924.8799999999999
owen benjamin

1922.0 --> 1926.48
then yeah kind of this in the same

1924.88 --> 1930.0800000000002
fashion that

1926.48 --> 1934.3990000000001
what i do on my show typically

1930.08 --> 1937.36
is kind of a response energy uh

1934.399 --> 1939.5189999999998
manifestation in response to people

1937.36 --> 1942.8799999999999
people's activities in question

1939.519 --> 1945.6
the same effect kind of applies in chat

1942.88 --> 1947.279
when i'm commenting on somebody actually

1945.6 --> 1949.36
live streaming

1947.279 --> 1951.519
and that's always worked out great with

1949.36 --> 1954.1589999999999
owen benjamin

1951.519 --> 1955.039
because he likes to say things tell

1954.159 --> 1957.519
really good

1955.039 --> 1958.48
in share really good insights and then i

1957.519 --> 1962.3990000000001
typically

1958.48 --> 1965.279
like to summarize them in like a perfect

1962.399 --> 1966.399
readable formula like a perfect way to

1965.279 --> 1969.36
say that

1966.399 --> 1971.4399999999998
in the moment and that's what i really

1969.36 --> 1974.4799999999998
like to do

1971.44 --> 1975.3600000000001
and i think that own has appreciated

1974.48 --> 1978.48
that

1975.36 --> 1981.36
from me in the past he's read out some

1978.48 --> 1981.3600000000001
of my chats

1984.32 --> 1986.96
but anyway

1988.08 --> 1993.279
it was good to see a live stream again

1990.159 --> 1993.279
even if there was not yet

1995.2 --> 1999.6000000000001
right but 24 7 discord yesterday yeah i

1997.679 --> 2001.8400000000001
was on there quite a long time

1999.6 --> 2005.36
eventually kind of dropped out of it

2001.84 --> 2008.559
went to do other things

2005.36 --> 2011.1999999999998
but yeah there was a girl in there

2008.559 --> 2011.2
was it again

2012.24 --> 2020.32
that came in

2016.0 --> 2020.32
from a baller approach but

2021.2 --> 2024.559
wow look at that

2026.0 --> 2030.0
here come the trolls i was wondering

2028.08 --> 2032.399
where all the down votes went

2030.0 --> 2034.24
you know there's so many people out

2032.399 --> 2036.6399999999999
there that just have no life

2034.24 --> 2039.2
except for doing this kind of [ __ ] oh

2036.64 --> 2041.44
quickly go around we must go around to

2039.2 --> 2044.159
all live streams concerning flat earth

2041.44 --> 2047.519
and then quickly downvote them

2044.159 --> 2048.96
because yeah we can't allow flat

2047.519 --> 2051.839
earthers to build up an

2048.96 --> 2052.56
image like they're somehow respected or

2051.839 --> 2054.7999999999997
something

2052.56 --> 2057.7599999999998
right can't do that so you got to come

2054.8 --> 2057.76
by every day

2058.0 --> 2063.679
every day to troll every day to

2061.119 --> 2064.3990000000003
to lay your little turd in any way you

2063.679 --> 2066.7200000000003
can

2064.399 --> 2066.72
right

2069.44 --> 2074.399
makes you special makes you special that

2072.0 --> 2077.52
you can downvote somebody

2074.399 --> 2077.52
you're so special now

2077.919 --> 2082.96
right i don't give a [ __ ] anyway but uh

2080.72 --> 2087.04
yeah it was good to be part of that

2082.96 --> 2087.04
24 7 discord at the time

2087.599 --> 2091.52
the girl was having a lot of trouble

2091.919 --> 2095.5989999999997
figuring things out about the flat earth

2094.24 --> 2098.64
arguments

2095.599 --> 2100.4
and she went on claiming things that are

2098.64 --> 2102.8799999999997
technically impossible

2100.4 --> 2104.7200000000003
but she didn't realize that it wasn't a

2102.88 --> 2107.839
baller

2104.72 --> 2110.7999999999997
it wasn't an act of a baller trying to

2107.839 --> 2112.88
reify something that they know isn't

2110.8 --> 2114.5600000000004
impossible and then tried to justify

2112.88 --> 2116.0
that somehow that was not the case she

2114.56 --> 2119.119
really didn't understand

2116.0 --> 2121.92
and for me was a great opportunity well

2119.119 --> 2124.4
to explain it in utter detail and i'm

2121.92 --> 2126.4
really proud of it it was like a

2124.4 --> 2127.92
a real teacher moment and she

2126.4 --> 2131.28
appreciated it

2127.92 --> 2134.2400000000002
twice and that's like yes

2131.28 --> 2135.52
yes she and she really got confronted

2134.24 --> 2138.0
with it like wait but

2135.52 --> 2139.839
then what's going on this can't work

2138.0 --> 2140.24
then and it makes sense that it can't

2139.839 --> 2142.88
work

2140.24 --> 2145.839
like it really got to her and that was

2142.88 --> 2145.839
great

2146.88 --> 2150.6400000000003
and then after a while though she got

2148.64 --> 2152.48
really triggered by some other people

2150.64 --> 2154.24
because it it kind of stressed her out

2152.48 --> 2156.0
you know it's really the breaking of the

2154.24 --> 2159.2
cognitive this is i got to her

2156.0 --> 2161.599
through reason it worked but

2159.2 --> 2164.0
then she has to deal with the stress and

2161.599 --> 2165.28
she basically did that by troll baiting

2164.0 --> 2166.48
people

2165.28 --> 2168.4
that were not even part of the

2166.48 --> 2169.599
conversation they were just trolls in

2168.4 --> 2172.1600000000003
chat

2169.599 --> 2173.2000000000003
she was baiting that to kind of like

2172.16 --> 2175.68
step away

2173.2 --> 2176.96
from the situation of the stress of

2175.68 --> 2178.56
figuring out that

2176.96 --> 2181.119
what she had always believed didn't

2178.56 --> 2181.119
really work

2183.839 --> 2190.32
yeah amanda young

2187.119 --> 2191.44
it's on 24 7 discord yesterday was was

2190.32 --> 2194.6400000000003
it in the evening

2191.44 --> 2201.839
for me hey

2194.64 --> 2201.839
nathan oakley 1980 good to see you

2229.28 --> 2232.5600000000004
yeah sorry look 24 7 discord there's a

2231.92 --> 2235.599
lot of it

2232.56 --> 2238.4
and it's just moments it just happened

2235.599 --> 2243.839
to be that moment where

2238.4 --> 2243.839
i was able to kind of get to this girl

2245.04 --> 2252.56
like get get the information to her

2249.04 --> 2254.96
very carefully to really calmly lay it

2252.56 --> 2256.0
out with every detail and immediately as

2254.96 --> 2258.96
you're explaining already

2256.0 --> 2260.72
pointing out like this this is that this

2258.96 --> 2263.599
is that this can't work with this

2260.72 --> 2265.1189999999997
this is how it really works and she

2263.599 --> 2268.2400000000002
tried to test me on that too

2265.119 --> 2271.359
because she she had real trouble

2268.24 --> 2272.9599999999996
with the idea that gas is not

2271.359 --> 2274.88
susceptible to momentum

2272.96 --> 2276.64
and she had so much trouble with it that

2274.88 --> 2279.119
at some point she even tried to

2276.64 --> 2280.3199999999997
say that momentum and motion are the

2279.119 --> 2283.2000000000003
same thing

2280.32 --> 2284.2400000000002
which of course they're not that's why

2283.2 --> 2288.96
they have different

2284.24 --> 2288.9599999999996
type of names different words

2290.079 --> 2294.1600000000003
and gas is not susceptible to momentum

2292.64 --> 2296.7999999999997
it's only susceptible

2294.16 --> 2298.0
to pressure differential i try to

2296.8 --> 2301.76
explain that to her like if

2298.0 --> 2304.88
you're gonna have a

2301.76 --> 2305.5200000000004
sealed container or sealed enough and

2304.88 --> 2307.839
you're gonna

2305.52 --> 2309.119
accelerate it in a linear fashion in one

2307.839 --> 2311.359
direction

2309.119 --> 2313.76
then the pressures within are going to

2311.359 --> 2315.52
try to rearrange themselves

2313.76 --> 2316.96
because they're being pushed to the back

2315.52 --> 2320.0
because unlike

2316.96 --> 2320.88
solids and liquids gases don't have

2320.0 --> 2323.599
momentum

2320.88 --> 2325.04
so they basically want to stay in their

2323.599 --> 2327.92
position

2325.04 --> 2330.32
if like euclidean wise even as the whole

2327.92 --> 2333.599
thing is accelerating

2330.32 --> 2334.96
well they will push to the back

2333.599 --> 2336.96
and then for example if you have a

2334.96 --> 2338.8
helium balloon in there let's just say a

2336.96 --> 2340.0
car for example it is a kind of a close

2338.8 --> 2341.8390000000004
container the air can't just

2340.0 --> 2344.24
move through because the windows are all

2341.839 --> 2345.44
closed then because the

2344.24 --> 2347.52
pressure is going to build up in the

2345.44 --> 2349.52
back because the thing is accelerating

2347.52 --> 2351.119
and the gas is

2349.52 --> 2352.96
not having momentum there's pressure

2351.119 --> 2355.2000000000003
going to build up from

2352.96 --> 2357.2
the container wall the back of the car

2355.2 --> 2359.4399999999996
pushing against that gas

2357.2 --> 2361.5989999999997
while a helium balloon still having the

2359.44 --> 2362.48
lower pressure than the overall air

2361.599 --> 2365.28
inside is

2362.48 --> 2365.76
because of that going to move forward

2365.28 --> 2367.76
this is

2365.76 --> 2368.96
all because gas is not susceptible to

2367.76 --> 2372.6400000000003
momentum

2368.96 --> 2373.2
which is specifically you give it a

2372.64 --> 2376.4
force

2373.2 --> 2376.8799999999997
and then it keeps moving without that

2376.4 --> 2379.359
force

2376.88 --> 2380.88
being constantly introduced right gases

2379.359 --> 2382.96
don't do that

2380.88 --> 2384.0
what they do is they respond to the

2382.96 --> 2386.7200000000003
pressure differential

2384.0 --> 2388.4
immediately move in all directions to

2386.72 --> 2390.56
equalize that pressure

2388.4 --> 2391.76
so if you're going to push with your

2390.56 --> 2393.839
head you're going to push against the

2391.76 --> 2397.76
air you might get a slight breeze

2393.839 --> 2400.16
that's the air pressure building up

2397.76 --> 2401.2000000000003
building up and then immediately causing

2400.16 --> 2403.2
the gases

2401.2 --> 2405.9199999999996
to move in all directions ending up

2403.2 --> 2408.3999999999996
around it and behind it

2405.92 --> 2411.839
so it doesn't have momentum if you slap

2408.4 --> 2413.28
air it doesn't keep on moving

2411.839 --> 2415.119
right because it doesn't have momentum

2413.28 --> 2418.2400000000002
it only responds

2415.119 --> 2421.28
to gas pressure differential

2418.24 --> 2422.72
and that's really important to know when

2421.28 --> 2425.28
you figure out

2422.72 --> 2427.2799999999997
that gases on earth can't move in

2425.28 --> 2428.079
lockstep with the presupposed spinning

2427.28 --> 2430.079
ball earth

2428.079 --> 2431.8390000000004
it can't do that because gases don't

2430.079 --> 2433.76
have momentum they can't move in

2431.839 --> 2436.7999999999997
lockstep

2433.76 --> 2439.0400000000004
they will always stay

2436.8 --> 2440.2400000000002
kind of in their place within the

2439.04 --> 2443.44
pressure system

2440.24 --> 2446.24
in euclidean space while other things

2443.44 --> 2446.2400000000002
might be moving

2451.119 --> 2457.44
your super pay pay uh thank you nathan

2454.48 --> 2457.44
ugly in 1980

2464.839 --> 2467.839
what

2471.359 --> 2474.48
oh hey mellow fellow yeah yeah i banned

2473.599 --> 2477.119
you yesterday

2474.48 --> 2478.64
because you're a dick i don't even know

2477.119 --> 2481.839
what you get a wrench here

2478.64 --> 2481.839
taking that away

2486.88 --> 2491.04
no it doesn't need banning right away

2488.72 --> 2495.839
but if he is gonna push that then he's

2491.04 --> 2495.839
gonna get a banning

2497.119 --> 2501.599
sure nathan sure if if that's what you

2499.839 --> 2504.24
want

2501.599 --> 2504.2400000000002
that's okay

2506.48 --> 2510.079
but yeah if anybody wants to help me out

2508.4 --> 2513.119
financially

2510.079 --> 2514.6400000000003
then paypal will be the most helpful but

2513.119 --> 2517.28
if you want to do a

2514.64 --> 2519.2799999999997
super chat oh thank you thank you very

2517.28 --> 2523.8390000000004

nathan thank you

2526.319 --> 2529.7599999999998
nathan oakley is ace

2533.599 --> 2537.119
also glad to hear that you're doing well

2536.16 --> 2540.56
enough again

2537.119 --> 2540.56
to be able to afford that

2549.2 --> 2553.359
what what's happening between you guys

2551.359 --> 2556.56
mellow what

2553.359 --> 2557.2
oh clis chris la jombe thank you for the

2556.56 --> 2560.319
10

2557.2 --> 2561.52
canadian dollar super chat donation good

2560.319 --> 2565.839
morning hang out

2561.52 --> 2565.839
love it glad you enjoy it

2583.119 --> 2586.319
i donate to you when i'm poor cause i

2585.52 --> 2590.56
assumed

2586.319 --> 2592.96
what what i don't get it

2590.56 --> 2595.04
but i really do appreciate the support i

2592.96 --> 2598.56
can really use it at this time so that's

2595.04 --> 2598.56
very helpful thank you nathan

2603.52 --> 2607.839
thank you bro

2614.72 --> 2618.8799999999997
not super boring well

2618.96 --> 2621.839
super important

2623.92 --> 2628.56
i don't know i'll not nag you about that

2631.119 --> 2648.319
oh all right okay

2634.64 --> 2651.04
well that's a timeout

2648.319 --> 2651.04
hey agm

2655.119 --> 2659.2000000000003
when you're broke i assume you might be

2657.04 --> 2661.92
too so that's when i donate oh

2659.2 --> 2665.359
okay nathan i don't understand exactly

2661.92 --> 2665.359
the trait of thought behind that

2665.44 --> 2670.2400000000002
although it might be considered a

2667.119 --> 2670.2400000000002
christian maneuvering

2674.839 --> 2680.72
maneuver

2676.4 --> 2680.7200000000003
i myself typically like to

2682.079 --> 2688.96
donate i guess even to like yeah

2685.2 --> 2690.0789999999997
people on the street that the ones that

2688.96 --> 2692.4
i trust that are not

2690.079 --> 2693.44
just going to try to psychologically pry

2692.4 --> 2696.2400000000002
it out of you

2693.44 --> 2697.52
but i do it typically when i'm on an

2696.24 --> 2701.04
upward curve

2697.52 --> 2702.8
so not when i'm loaded but actually when

2701.04 --> 2705.44
i am poor

2702.8 --> 2706.48
but i'm expecting to get a little better

2705.44 --> 2709.599
and then

2706.48 --> 2712.0
because of that rejoice i do typically

2709.599 --> 2714.2400000000002
think like okay now i kind of have to do

2712.0 --> 2714.24
that

2716.88 --> 2733.839
and it always works out great for me

2734.96 --> 2738.16
uh no agm

2744.88 --> 2749.599
i i don't i wouldn't know where to keep

2746.64 --> 2751.2
a chicken right now

2749.599 --> 2753.2000000000003
i didn't know you had chickens for

2751.2 --> 2761.839
bartering

2753.2 --> 2761.839
hey jim

2767.64 --> 2773.44
[Music]

2769.839 --> 2777.44
now a hamster definitely not

2773.44 --> 2777.44
hamster i don't consider a hamster as a

2786.839 --> 2789.839
commodity

2807.359 --> 2813.119
nope no pets right now i don't i can't

2810.64 --> 2814.0
i can't do that i can't have pets right

2813.119 --> 2818.96
now it's just

2814.0 --> 2821.599
no just no get it no no pets

2818.96 --> 2823.92
it's not going to work can't do that

2821.599 --> 2831.599
can't afford it can't manage it

2823.92 --> 2835.6800000000003
not right now

2831.599 --> 2838.96
oh all right well [ __ ] off then huh

2835.68 --> 2839.52
mr kaplani pants maybe you should figure

2838.96 --> 2843.2
out that

2839.52 --> 2844.8
if you don't like being censored as you

2843.2 --> 2848.16
call it maybe you should

2844.8 --> 2851.119
stop acting like a dick huh

2848.16 --> 2851.52
and then maybe i won't censor you censor

2851.119 --> 2856.839
you

2851.52 --> 2859.839
right remove you for disruptive behavior

2856.839 --> 2859.839
actually

2882.319 --> 2887.839
oh well thank you nathan i really do

2884.559 --> 2887.8390000000004
appreciate that

2894.559 --> 2900.96
look if if good times for me

2897.68 --> 2904.16
financially are ever going to come

2900.96 --> 2908.559
then i i do know that i do

2904.16 --> 2911.04
also kind of have like a karmic or moral

2908.559 --> 2915.8390000000004
responsibility to also support

2911.04 --> 2918.72
you and the other guys as well i do

2915.839 --> 2918.72
it's just that

2921.28 --> 2929.3590000000004
you know i can't really afford it

2926.24 --> 2931.359
not right now i thought i was going to

2929.359 --> 2933.44
be able to

2931.359 --> 2934.7999999999997
like since this month but that didn't

2933.44 --> 2938.96
really work out

2934.8 --> 2938.96
and yeah the feedback i got also

2941.44 --> 2946.559
it was kind of weird how that works

2950.48 --> 2957.839
smash that share button indeed share on

2953.28 --> 2957.8390000000004
any platform you didn't fit

2969.2 --> 2974.0
i get 40 people watching consistently

2971.76 --> 2974.0
well

2974.079 --> 2979.04
sometimes not always though sometimes

2976.16 --> 2981.04
it's like around 20.

2979.04 --> 2985.839
but it all depends on the day and the

2981.04 --> 2985.839
mood people are in and all that

2988.64 --> 2993.2
oh yeah thanks for reminding me about

2990.559 --> 2993.2000000000003
that nathan

2993.599 --> 2997.2000000000003
but it's not really almost 2k it's been

2996.079 --> 3001.04
like that for

2997.2 --> 3003.4399999999996
months now so let me check it out

3001.04 --> 3005.44
it's just it they stuck it they

3003.44 --> 3010.839
literally just kept it stuck

3005.44 --> 3013.76
at at 1850

3010.839 --> 3015.839
exactly and it's been like that for

3013.76 --> 3018.48
months i i kind of stopped keeping track

3015.839 --> 3020.4
of it because i did get a couple of subs

3018.48 --> 3021.839
but even when i look at the channel

3020.4 --> 3023.76
details about it

3021.839 --> 3025.04
there's something weird going on with it

3023.76 --> 3026.88
because it does say oh you got new

3025.04 --> 3028.079
members oh and you lost new members and

3026.88 --> 3031.04
you got new mem and you lost

3028.079 --> 3033.3590000000004
and just keeps stuck exactly at the same

3031.04 --> 3033.359
spot

3039.119 --> 3042.88
you can a bit a hundred easy clutch bear

3041.52 --> 3046.319
you think so

3042.88 --> 3049.28
if you want to i would appreciate if

3046.319 --> 3050.16
more people that could enjoy me and what

3049.28 --> 3053.52
i do

3050.16 --> 3055.839
they could find me right that's what

3053.52 --> 3055.839
it's really

3066.839 --> 3069.839
about

3086.24 --> 3089.4399999999996
no roger mc it's actually the other way

3088.64 --> 3093.359
around

3089.44 --> 3095.28
you know since i figured out flat earth

3093.359 --> 3096.64
i think overall i've made more money

3095.28 --> 3099.8390000000004
than i did

3096.64 --> 3103.5989999999997
the entire life before that

3099.839 --> 3104.96
actually roger mc doesn't make me all of

3103.599 --> 3109.52
a sudden rich

3104.96 --> 3111.359
but i did actually make more money

3109.52 --> 3112.72
then the rest of my life pretty much

3111.359 --> 3116.88
combined

3112.72 --> 3120.8799999999997
after i engage with flat earth yeah

3116.88 --> 3124.079
that's that doesn't conform to how you

3120.88 --> 3126.559
like reality to be well i'm sorry about

3124.079 --> 3126.559
that then

3133.92 --> 3142.319
no tarot 306 no

3138.96 --> 3142.319
i'm not gonna unban them

3143.839 --> 3147.92
all they're gonna do is just [ __ ] over

3146.16 --> 3149.359
the show anyway

3147.92 --> 3151.44
because now they want to come in because

3149.359 --> 3152.4
there's some new looks and they want to

3151.44 --> 3155.28
ruin it

3152.4 --> 3167.839
by inserting [ __ ] so i'm just going to

3155.28 --> 3167.8390000000004
kick them out

3176.96 --> 3183.92
yes tara 306 yes globetart trolls

3181.04 --> 3186.319
have thousands and thousands of soccer

3183.92 --> 3186.319
cards

3192.8 --> 3196.559
dude mind of god i didn't have you

3195.04 --> 3198.96
banned

3196.559 --> 3199.92
you do realize that when was it a few

3198.96 --> 3203.44
weeks ago i

3199.92 --> 3206.7200000000003
literally unbanned every single person

3203.44 --> 3211.28
every year you can't be banned

3206.72 --> 3215.2799999999997
it's impossible i unbanned everyone

3211.28 --> 3217.599
whoever was banned for whatever reason

3215.28 --> 3218.8
has been unbanned so whatever your issue

3217.599 --> 3221.52
is it's

3218.8 --> 3222.079
it's not correct you're not banned

3221.52 --> 3223.92
nothing

3222.079 --> 3237.8390000000004
is banned except for what has been

3223.92 --> 3237.839
banned in the last few days

3257.599 --> 3264.6400000000003
yes it is flat definitely

3261.2 --> 3266.3999999999996
is flat earth is flat it's not a globe

3264.64 --> 3269.359
there's no curvature

3266.4 --> 3269.359
none whatsoever

3269.92 --> 3275.04
right horizon at eye level or slightly

3272.8 --> 3277.52
below it and as you raise up it stays

3275.04 --> 3279.599
slightly below eye level because it's

3277.52 --> 3283.28
flat

3279.599 --> 3284.2400000000002
and it's not a curve that is causing you

3283.28 --> 3287.44
to not see

3284.24 --> 3289.1189999999997
further it's the limited sight through

3287.44 --> 3292.16
because of the air you have to look

3289.119 --> 3294.2400000000002
through that's going to blur things up

3292.16 --> 3295.799
right because if there was no air you

3294.24 --> 3300.0789999999997
would literally see

3295.799 --> 3302.079
unbelievably far unbelievably far

3300.079 --> 3304.079
at a height though because at the lower

3302.079 --> 3307.44
at the ground you're not going to see

3304.079 --> 3310.96
unbelievably far because of perspective

3307.44 --> 3314.0
and dive what is it a refraction

3310.96 --> 3315.68
it's gonna eventually end up causing

3314.0 --> 3318.4
things in the foreground to slightly

3315.68 --> 3320.24
block things in the background

3318.4 --> 3322.64
because of the optical slant effect but

3320.24 --> 3325.5989999999997
if you go higher up

3322.64 --> 3326.4
and yeah in vacuous condition mind you

3325.599 --> 3329.6800000000003
right

3326.4 --> 3332.96
you could literally see unbelievably far

3329.68 --> 3334.319
if the entire realm was vacuum which it

3332.96 --> 3336.319
isn't

3334.319 --> 3338.5589999999997
because then there would be nothing to

3336.319 --> 3349.839
blur up

3338.559 --> 3349.8390000000004
sight causing a limit to side

3355.76 --> 3360.6400000000003
no it doesn't rocket man that's just a

3357.76 --> 3360.6400000000003
straight out lie

3360.799 --> 3364.799
the horizon doesn't dip

3366.4 --> 3372.7200000000003
horizon is always at eye level

3369.44 --> 3373.2000000000003
or slightly below it but once it reached

3372.72 --> 3377.2
that

3373.2 --> 3381.839
slightly below eye level level

3377.2 --> 3385.4399999999996
doesn't dip any further yeah it stays

3381.839 --> 3387.2799999999997
at that apparent height slightly below

3385.44 --> 3388.96
eye level no matter how high you go it

3387.28 --> 3392.079
stays there

3388.96 --> 3394.559
you know and that's because

3392.079 --> 3395.119
the earth is not a globe geometry

3394.559 --> 3398.48
because

3395.119 --> 3401.119
then the horizon

3398.48 --> 3401.76
would not be at eye level ever and it

3401.119 --> 3405.1600000000003
would be

3401.76 --> 3408.4
constantly dropping constantly

3405.16 --> 3411.52
significantly like up to

3408.4 --> 3415.599
80 degrees

3411.52 --> 3417.839
dropping 80 angles 80 degree angle

3415.599 --> 3419.6800000000003
dropping that sort of dropping off the

3417.839 --> 3421.44
horizon right if the earth is a ball

3419.68 --> 3423.1189999999997
you went up well guess what that doesn't

3421.44 --> 3427.2000000000003
happen ever

3423.119 --> 3430.2400000000002
it doesn't no instead the horizon

3427.2 --> 3432.8799999999997
drops slightly below eye level

3430.24 --> 3434.319
and then no matter how high up you go it

3432.88 --> 3438.799
stays there

3434.319 --> 3438.799
yeah that doesn't work on a globe

3444.24 --> 3448.0789999999997
you can repeat it yeah i just explained

3447.359 --> 3450.0
it to you yet

3448.079 --> 3452.4
dip slightly and then it doesn't keep on

3450.0 --> 3454.4
dropping and if the earth was a ball it

3452.4 --> 3457.119
would have to keep on dropping

3454.4 --> 3457.76
until eventually you literally see a

3457.119 --> 3460.48
globe

3457.76 --> 3462.6400000000003
beneath you that doesn't happen in the

3460.48 --> 3463.28
physical real world there's no footage

3462.64 --> 3466.8799999999997
of that

3463.28 --> 3468.1600000000003
at all at all at all not even nasa has

3466.88 --> 3471.2000000000003
that footage

3468.16 --> 3474.319
you know why because you can't fake that

3471.2 --> 3477.1189999999997
you can't fake that and not make people

3474.319 --> 3477.7599999999998
catch on to it and then once they catch

3477.119 --> 3480.0
on to it

3477.76 --> 3481.76
then it's like super exposed that

3480.0 --> 3484.24
there's literally a cg

3481.76 --> 3486.7200000000003
eyeball being generated that's why they

3484.24 --> 3488.799
don't even freaking do it in movies

3486.72 --> 3489.839
they don't even do it in sci-fi movies

3488.799 --> 3492.079
and series

3489.839 --> 3494.319
they don't do that because it will

3492.079 --> 3497.599
immediately stand out that it's

3494.319 --> 3499.2
absolutely fake yeah

3497.599 --> 3500.6400000000003
because it doesn't happen like that

3499.2 --> 3503.839
intuition cannot be

3500.64 --> 3503.839
fooled like that

3506.16 --> 3510.0
do you have a specific altitude any

3508.16 --> 3513.1189999999997
altitude already explain it

3510.0 --> 3514.0
any altitude any altitude no matter how

3513.119 --> 3517.839
high up you go

3514.0 --> 3521.119
any altitude horizon

3517.839 --> 3523.92
once you leave the surface drops

3521.119 --> 3524.48
slightly below eye level and then no

3523.92 --> 3528.559
matter

3524.48 --> 3532.559
how high up you go it stays

3528.559 --> 3536.079
there you get it it stays

3532.559 --> 3540.3190000000004
there it doesn't continue dropping

3536.079 --> 3545.8390000000004
as you go higher up it stays there

3540.319 --> 3545.839
yeah getting through to you yet

3547.359 --> 3551.119
oh really you seen that footage where

3548.88 --> 3553.359
that does happen oh what footage was

3551.119 --> 3553.359
there

3553.52 --> 3557.28
is any fisheye lensing going on there

3556.24 --> 3560.3999999999996
was it already

3557.28 --> 3563.2000000000003
a shot starting in

3560.4 --> 3565.119
supposed orbit or space right because

3563.2 --> 3568.319
i'm pretty sure that's not going to be

3565.119 --> 3572.88
a from the ground up singular shot in

3568.319 --> 3574.88
which that happens tiny womble

3572.88 --> 3578.4
no you wrote it ruby why don't you

3574.88 --> 3578.4
freaking prove it then [ __ ]

3581.76 --> 3589.599
prove it then show the [ __ ] footage

3584.839 --> 3594.0789999999997
[ __ ] rocket man dumbass

3589.599 --> 3594.079
show it then come on

3596.4 --> 3601.839
so easy to prove except there is no

3598.559 --> 3601.8390000000004
footage of that at all

3602.16 --> 3608.5589999999997
oh well you're banned [ __ ]

3605.28 --> 3610.88
get the [ __ ] out [ __ ]

3608.559 --> 3614.2400000000002
but you can find your imaginary footage

3610.88 --> 3617.359
of the horizon dropping up to 80 degrees

3614.24 --> 3618.64
below your feet right [ __ ] because

3617.359 --> 3621.2799999999997
that doesn't happen

3618.64 --> 3621.92
ever and there is no footage of that

3621.28 --> 3625.92
none

3621.92 --> 3628.559
what so ever there's no singular shot

3625.92 --> 3631.359
from the ground going up where you see

3628.559 --> 3632.2400000000002
the horizon drop up to 80 degrees below

3631.359 --> 3634.72
eye level

3632.24 --> 3635.7599999999998
which it would have to if you're on a

3634.72 --> 3643.839
freaking ball

3635.76 --> 3643.8390000000004
which you're not

3656.559 --> 3662.88
yeah i have been on a plane

3659.68 --> 3664.96
was it 17 or was on a plane personal

3662.88 --> 3665.92
plane like you can sit in there with

3664.96 --> 3668.88
like three people

3665.92 --> 3670.64
max yeah i've been on that it didn't

3668.88 --> 3674.799
have any curved windows

3670.64 --> 3678.0789999999997
uh huh guess what horizon

3674.799 --> 3679.92
eye level yeah technically slightly

3678.079 --> 3681.3590000000004
below either way it stays that way it

3679.92 --> 3684.799
stays that way when you go up

3681.359 --> 3687.839
i know i saw it right

3684.799 --> 3690.88
and i don't even remember

3687.839 --> 3693.599
looking for it i was just focusing on

3690.88 --> 3694.079
the flight i didn't even know i didn't

3693.599 --> 3697.44
even

3694.079 --> 3698.079
give a [ __ ] whether the earth would be

3697.44 --> 3700.2400000000002
visually

3698.079 --> 3702.0
a globe or not i didn't care i was still

3700.24 --> 3704.0789999999997
in a period where i was completely stuck

3702.0 --> 3706.96
in my head

3704.079 --> 3708.6400000000003
and just didn't test that [ __ ] because i

3706.96 --> 3710.96
was kind of afraid

3708.64 --> 3712.64
for people that were still surrounding

3710.96 --> 3715.599
me even my friend circle

3712.64 --> 3716.0
that were picking up on me figuring it

3715.599 --> 3719.839
out

3716.0 --> 3723.52
and like yeah they discouraged me

3719.839 --> 3724.16
in several ways so i just didn't focus

3723.52 --> 3726.559
on it

3724.16 --> 3727.92
right but i do remember i do remember it

3726.559 --> 3730.96
i do remember

3727.92 --> 3733.28
having been on that little plane and

3730.96 --> 3735.839
then seeing the horizon at eye level

3733.28 --> 3737.92
yeah no matter how high up we went yeah

3735.839 --> 3738.64
it went all over the place yeah it kept

3737.92 --> 3741.839
at eye level

3738.64 --> 3741.839
yeah i did

3760.24 --> 3764.8799999999997
now minor god wolfy is not a random

3763.76 --> 3768.96
idiot

3764.88 --> 3771.359
he is a lying scumbag scam artist

3768.96 --> 3773.039
he is a lying scumbag a scam artist

3771.359 --> 3776.0789999999997
that's wolfie

3773.039 --> 3776.7990000000004
lying scumbag scam artist that's what he

3776.079 --> 3780.1600000000003
is

3776.799 --> 3782.72
he knows he's lying he is actively

3780.16 --> 3783.44
trying to create machinations in order

3782.72 --> 3787.1189999999997
to fool

3783.44 --> 3790.2400000000002
people into believing it is a globe by

3787.119 --> 3794.2400000000002
blatant blatant

3790.24 --> 3798.319
fraud yeah he's a scam artist

3794.24 --> 3811.839
a scumbag hear that wolfie

3798.319 --> 3811.839
you're a scam artist scumbag provably so

3824.0 --> 3829.76
no you can't mind a god i don't care

3827.28 --> 3834.079
about that

3829.76 --> 3834.079
it's typical though

3835.839 --> 3839.839
hold on

3855.52 --> 3858.24
just checking

3860.4 --> 3864.48
yeah take a look at his work all of his

3862.64 --> 3867.839
work the claims he makes

3864.48 --> 3870.64
are fraud they're fraud they're [ __ ]

3867.839 --> 3873.52
he's lying about the horizon dropping

3870.64 --> 3874.5589999999997
he's lying about curvature and he

3873.52 --> 3877.599
creates

3874.559 --> 3879.3590000000004
machinations and i don't care to even go

3877.599 --> 3882.96
into the details because

3879.359 --> 3886.319
i have a life and if i had to spend

3882.96 --> 3890.319
all those hours in detail debunking

3886.319 --> 3893.599
machinations from blatant scam artists

3890.319 --> 3896.64
online i'd have no life left to

3893.599 --> 3898.96
basically explain you how things really

3896.64 --> 3901.44
do work and how you can test them for

3898.96 --> 3901.44
yourself

3907.119 --> 3910.7200000000003
that terror through who cares

3910.88 --> 3915.76
look what's dude i their social life

3914.16 --> 3919.44
is their social life if they want to

3915.76 --> 3922.3190000000004
[ __ ] it up then that's their business

3919.44 --> 3924.96
i'm more concerned about just the fraud

3922.319 --> 3928.319
being committed

3924.96 --> 3928.319
that's what i'm interested in

3934.24 --> 3937.9199999999996
yeah how about trigonometry what

3936.0 --> 3940.079
trigonometry of what

3937.92 --> 3941.2000000000003
the lights in the sky that you're going

3940.079 --> 3943.52
to presuppose

3941.2 --> 3944.8799999999997
have a literal distance and position

3943.52 --> 3946.4
somewhere

3944.88 --> 3948.48
based on the vantage point

3946.4 --> 3949.52
presupposition that the earth is a ball

3948.48 --> 3953.2
wrapped

3949.52 --> 3965.839
underneath it that triangulation

3953.2 --> 3965.839
sasha sahas

3974.24 --> 3978.799
no now you can get the [ __ ] out and your

3977.119 --> 3982.799
sucker counts too

3978.799 --> 3982.799

4019.839 --> 4024.4
believe

4020.559 --> 4026.88
it was a global squirt for me [ __ ]

4024.4 --> 4028.2400000000002

how much of scumbags you are

4033.68 --> 4038.16
[ __ ] come on show yourself in chat

4040.24 --> 4046.64
did the globe scam artist

4043.28 --> 4050.079
touch you in a bad place and then

4046.64 --> 4051.2
you really liked him because he he told

4050.079 --> 4055.119
you a lie

4051.2 --> 4057.839
about the earth being a globe huh

4055.119 --> 4057.839
squirt for me

4076.88 --> 4080.6400000000003
so can you do basic calculus or even

4079.28 --> 4083.599
trigonometry yes

4080.64 --> 4084.24
yes i can i don't give a [ __ ] though but

4083.599 --> 4086.799
i can

4084.24 --> 4088.319
and i already know what trigonometry is

4086.799 --> 4091.119
and how globers

4088.319 --> 4093.68
like to use it based on certain

4091.119 --> 4097.319
presuppositional vantage points right

4093.68 --> 4098.639999999999
the orientation of the surface

4097.319 --> 4102.0
pre-assumed

4098.64 --> 4104.400000000001
in the construct of trigonometry

4102.0 --> 4105.44
like sizing up angular positions of

4104.4 --> 4107.839
stars right

4105.44 --> 4108.879999999999
to which there are no literal positions

4107.839 --> 4110.88
provable

4108.88 --> 4112.08
just angular positions in relation to

4110.88 --> 4115.4400000000005
the earth's surface right

4112.08 --> 4116.239
yeah i know trigonometry i know what

4115.44 --> 4119.12
that means

4116.239 --> 4120.718999999999
i know why ballers bring it forward

4119.12 --> 4123.2789999999995
every single time

4120.719 --> 4124.56
you don't because you're a [ __ ] echo

have [ __ ] arguments though

4278.08 --> 4281.84
yeah based on actual empirical data and

4280.96 --> 4285.12
real science

4281.84 --> 4289.28
huh huh [ __ ] so

4285.12 --> 4291.76
go waddle back to your liar

4289.28 --> 4292.719

4298.4 --> 4315.839999999999
while you're at it yeah [ __ ]

4318.0 --> 4322.08
yeah guns i've never run thanks for

4319.44 --> 4325.36
backing me up on that i know he is

4322.08 --> 4327.76
like that guy is like rumpus

4325.36 --> 4330.799999999999
is complicated one could argue that

4327.76 --> 4332.96
rumpus has some serious inner

4330.8 --> 4335.1990000000005
issues that his cognitive dissonance

4332.96 --> 4335.679
like really gets to the core of him

4335.199 --> 4339.44
which is

4335.679 --> 4343.12
problematic and amusing at the same time

4339.44 --> 4346.4
wolfy however knows damn well

4343.12 --> 4347.36
that he's a [ __ ] liar he even has the

4346.4 --> 4350.48
freaking lie

4347.36 --> 4350.799999999999
sweat at times when he's doing it he is

4350.48 --> 4354.4
a

4350.8 --> 4358.4800000000005
total scumbag scam artist

4354.4 --> 4361.839999999999
total scumbag really disgusting

4358.48 --> 4365.44
repulsive individual

4361.84 --> 4366.159000000001
yeah that's the difference rhombus is

4365.44 --> 4368.239
just a

4366.159 --> 4369.44
just an unbelievable fantasist in my

4368.239 --> 4373.28
opinion

4369.44 --> 4376.08
it just seems like that he's different

4373.28 --> 4377.84
he's like this weird stuck true believer

4376.08 --> 4379.84
that just can never get out of it his

4377.84 --> 4382.08
intelligence completely got the best of

4379.84 --> 4382.08
him

4382.32 --> 4385.84
it's different

4397.36 --> 4401.599999999999
right so yeah you can be outraged now

4399.92 --> 4404.64
that i ban you and that i

4401.6 --> 4405.360000000001
say harsh things to you and then make

4404.64 --> 4406.96
soccer

4405.36 --> 4408.88
accounts and then i'll just ban you

4406.96 --> 4410.64
again because i'm used to that [ __ ] i

4408.88 --> 4412.719
don't give a [ __ ]

4410.64 --> 4414.64
even if i'm gonna be talking kind of

4412.719 --> 4416.2390000000005
mean-spirited like this

4414.64 --> 4418.0
i don't give a [ __ ] because you people

4416.239 --> 4419.199
are out there and you're the [ __ ]

4418.0 --> 4420.8
problem you hear me

4419.199 --> 4423.12
you're the [ __ ] problem you're the

4420.8 --> 4425.6
[ __ ] problem with this world

4423.12 --> 4428.719
people like you and what you do keep the

4425.6 --> 4428.719
world [ __ ]

4433.04 --> 4437.36
go [ __ ] yourself grimvy you [ __ ]

4438.84 --> 4441.84
[ __ ]

4452.84 --> 4456.64
ah

4454.4 --> 4458.879999999999
wait what the hell's happening to my

4456.64 --> 4458.88
chat

4460.719 --> 4468.88
did my chat just get stuck

4463.92 --> 4471.92
what the hell

4468.88 --> 4472.88
dude i just missed like the last three

4471.92 --> 4483.84
minutes

4472.88 --> 4483.84
just stopped showing it's crazy

4494.84 --> 4497.84
wow

4509.199 --> 4512.639999999999
yeah thank you for taking care of that

4510.719 --> 4516.64
emmanuel

4512.64 --> 4518.88
that was indeed a ban moment

4516.64 --> 4520.56
but that the chat didn't show it's weird

4518.88 --> 4522.96
because i was looking at the youtube

4520.56 --> 4522.96
page

4523.6 --> 4531.52
dude don't do that just don't

4527.199 --> 4531.5199999999995
mind a god don't do that

4533.199 --> 4540.48
that's funny it got auto deleted

4536.719 --> 4543.44
no it didn't just don't do that

4540.48 --> 4545.36
good you retracted it don't go there

4543.44 --> 4548.239
yeah don't start attacking

4545.36 --> 4550.5599999999995
everything yeah don't ever do that never

4548.239 --> 4554.0
do that

4550.56 --> 4557.04
only attack the people that are just

4554.0 --> 4558.08
visibly displaying that specific

4557.04 --> 4562.32
behavior

4558.08 --> 4564.8
that is the problem right don't ever

4562.32 --> 4566.08
pile it onto one group and then start

4564.8 --> 4570.64
jabbing at it never

4566.08 --> 4574.8
do that never ever do that

4570.64 --> 4574.8
right i know

4576.239 --> 4580.718999999999
and so i think that's fine just never do

4578.48 --> 4583.599999999999
that it's not good

4580.719 --> 4583.6
it's never good

4584.96 --> 4588.159
because it doesn't stop anyone from

4587.28 --> 4592.08
being like that

4588.159 --> 4594.32
ever it only causes more polarization

4592.08 --> 4609.84
and isolation it's completely useless to

4594.32 --> 4609.84
do that

4620.84 --> 4625.360000000001
so

4622.96 --> 4627.76
all right good to hear that meiner god i

4625.36 --> 4637.839999999999
appreciate your

4627.76 --> 4637.84
sensible response

4642.48 --> 4649.36
all right yeah hello moto

4646.08 --> 4652.64
india's amazing space program i have to

4649.36 --> 4656.4
say that their props do look very cool

4652.64 --> 4659.84
but it's just props though it's all crap

4656.4 --> 4659.839999999999
it's all make-believe [ __ ]

4663.04 --> 4668.239
like all space programs

4666.32 --> 4669.84
but it yeah the photos that i have seen

4668.239 --> 4673.36
they look pretty damn cool i

4669.84 --> 4675.12
agree i would definitely want a lego

4673.36 --> 4679.839999999999
version of that stuff

4675.12 --> 4679.84
right i definitely would

4718.8 --> 4721.76
yeah that's going to be a little

4719.76 --> 4724.64
difficult territ because amanda young

4721.76 --> 4724.64
already banned him

4733.199 --> 4737.04
i don't exactly know why though because

4735.44 --> 4739.12
the guy didn't

4737.04 --> 4740.88
seems like a more genuine believer you

4739.12 --> 4743.44
might have jumped the gun a little there

4740.88 --> 4743.4400000000005
emanuel

4744.159 --> 4749.839999999999
don't forget there are just genuine

4745.92 --> 4749.84
believers out there

4750.08 --> 4753.44
because not everybody is informed about

4752.96 --> 4756.2390000000005
everything

4753.44 --> 4758.159
a lot of people just love the space [ __ ]

4756.239 --> 4760.879999999999
like i used to

4758.159 --> 4762.4
i would be potentially somebody getting

4760.88 --> 4765.28
in this chat

4762.4 --> 4766.719
if i was not me and somebody else would

4765.28 --> 4768.159
have that role i would get in here and

4766.719 --> 4771.52
say but dude

4768.159 --> 4772.4
but it looked so real like what do you

4771.52 --> 4776.0
mean it's fake

4772.4 --> 4777.5199999999995
i would be like that right

4776.0 --> 4779.92
those are not the people that should be

4777.52 --> 4783.84
bad now it's okay emmanuel i know you

4779.92 --> 4788.2390000000005
you meant it well but this person does

4783.84 --> 4788.2390000000005
is just seems like just a believer

4789.28 --> 4793.199
not super well informed you know you

4791.52 --> 4795.52
recognize it by the

4793.199 --> 4796.32
tactics that they use to robot now if

4795.52 --> 4799.6
that has been

4796.32 --> 4801.759999999999
quite refined that means they have been

4799.6 --> 4802.719
confronted with flat earthers before and

4801.76 --> 4805.4400000000005
with that

4802.719 --> 4806.719
with certain facts that they have then

4805.44 --> 4809.5199999999995
engaged in

4806.719 --> 4810.08
ignoring and that's when they start to

4809.52 --> 4812.400000000001
become

4810.08 --> 4814.0
really like ballers that's when they

4812.4 --> 4816.239
start to lie to themselves

4814.0 --> 4817.12
start to conveniently forget things to

4816.239 --> 4820.4
continue

4817.12 --> 4823.199
their beliefs right

4820.4 --> 4824.96
but just newcomers they don't know all

4823.199 --> 4828.239
those tricks

4824.96 --> 4829.92
so try to try to look into how somebody

4828.239 --> 4833.839999999999
is saying something in order to figure

4829.92 --> 4833.84
that out

4844.32 --> 4849.92
hey patricia dockery long time no see

4848.159 --> 4853.199
legos are the best thing to come out of

4849.92 --> 4855.92
the space programs i totally agree

4853.199 --> 4857.199
space legos for the win i still have my

4855.92 --> 4859.4400000000005
space legos

4857.199 --> 4860.719
i still have freaking spaceship designs

4859.44 --> 4864.719
that i made when i was

4860.719 --> 4867.44
six in one piece i got it stored in a

4864.719 --> 4870.08
box somewhere

4867.44 --> 4871.28
one day one day i will show it i will

4870.08 --> 4874.8
show what i made

4871.28 --> 4880.639
like 37 years ago uh

4874.8 --> 4880.639
no wait 35 years ago

4884.08 --> 4888.159
because what i would typically do is

4885.52 --> 4889.280000000001
take the designs that were like

4888.159 --> 4892.32
published were

4889.28 --> 4892.639
produced by those things and then kind

4892.32 --> 4895.84
of

4892.639 --> 4896.8
use the systems of a style and their

4895.84 --> 4900.32
coloring

4896.8 --> 4903.92
to then evolve it like

4900.32 --> 4906.88
make it even more its own thing and like

4903.92 --> 4907.4400000000005
continuate the design types that were

4906.88 --> 4911.1990000000005
literally

4907.44 --> 4913.36
like sold and then continuate their

4911.199 --> 4916.719
design aspects and perfected that

4913.36 --> 4917.12
is what i was always doing always doing

4916.719 --> 4921.199
that

4917.12 --> 4924.4
every single time my entire pre-teen

4921.199 --> 4927.12
period always doing that

4924.4 --> 4928.4
taking something space lego-y always

4927.12 --> 4930.8
space lego and then

4928.4 --> 4931.839999999999
literally taking the concepts of that

4930.8 --> 4934.639
style

4931.84 --> 4936.32
and the design of yeah the the breed

4934.639 --> 4938.4800000000005
because there were different coloring

4936.32 --> 4940.4
setups and i would like take them as

4938.48 --> 4942.839999999999
different guilds

4940.4 --> 4945.44
and then literally continuate those

4942.84 --> 4948.08
concepts that were

4945.44 --> 4950.96
being sold and then try to perfect it

4948.08 --> 4950.96
that's what i would do

4952.32 --> 4957.12
kind of typical isn't it since i'm in my

4954.719 --> 4962.0
own ways kind of doing that

4957.12 --> 4962.0
with baller arguments as a hobby

4962.4 --> 4967.199
i used to do it with legos and now i do

4964.639 --> 4973.84
it with concepts

4967.199 --> 4973.839999999999
isn't that ironic

4982.8 --> 4989.12
but people who died the flights are us

4986.4 --> 4991.04
what people died do you mean the

4989.12 --> 4992.96
challenger

4991.04 --> 4994.96
sahas is that what you mean the

4992.96 --> 4996.96
challenger explosion

4994.96 --> 4998.32
right with all those terrible terrible

4996.96 --> 5001.199
deaths

4998.32 --> 5002.4
well guess what every single person that

5001.199 --> 5004.799999999999
supposedly died

5002.4 --> 5007.199
in that explosion of the challenger

5004.8 --> 5012.159000000001
later turned out to have

5007.199 --> 5012.159
mysterious twins everywhere

5012.84 --> 5017.1990000000005
yeah before not

5014.88 --> 5018.32
known although they turned out to have

5017.199 --> 5023.12
twins oh

5018.32 --> 5023.12
oh yeah no i'm pretty sure nobody died

5023.199 --> 5029.839999999999
if that was indeed what you're referring

5025.52 --> 5029.84
to so has to be

5040.08 --> 5044.719
yeah whatever foul and buchanan i call

5042.719 --> 5045.76
them legos because other people call

5044.719 --> 5048.0
them legos

5045.76 --> 5051.04
i don't care if it's is if it's you're

5048.0 --> 5054.32
just supposed to say a lego

5051.04 --> 5071.84
in dutch i would say lego in english a

5054.32 --> 5071.84
deaf tendency to just call them legos

5072.719 --> 5080.08
what entry burn is injury

5076.48 --> 5083.04
oh yeah i do know it's this the idea

5080.08 --> 5085.44
that you're supposed to enter the earth

5083.04 --> 5086.48
atmosphere from outer space oh yeah does

5085.44 --> 5088.719
that work oh it doesn't

5086.48 --> 5092.4
right then when you enter at great

5088.719 --> 5095.04
velocity then the friction of the air

5092.4 --> 5095.839999999999
is mysteriously going to heat it up

5095.04 --> 5098.8
right

5095.84 --> 5100.159000000001
we've all seen the sci-fi you re-enter

5098.8 --> 5102.8
and then

5100.159 --> 5106.0
you see the flame oh no is it is the

5102.8 --> 5109.04
plating going to hold

5106.0 --> 5111.04
and then oh it's in the atmosphere now

5109.04 --> 5112.08
it's no longer in that thermosphere

5111.04 --> 5115.76
thing when that happens

5112.08 --> 5119.36
right yeah i know the science fiction

5115.76 --> 5121.4400000000005
none of that is actually real any

5119.36 --> 5123.759999999999
none of that it doesn't happen it

5121.44 --> 5127.839999999999
doesn't happen like that in any way in

5123.76 --> 5127.84
the real world

5135.04 --> 5141.44
hey even which movie was it there was a

5138.84 --> 5144.56
movie that

5141.44 --> 5144.5599999999995
was it the one about

5146.08 --> 5150.0
about a reporter i'm not sure which

5147.92 --> 5150.88
movie it was one of the older ones that

5150.0 --> 5153.36
lay

5150.88 --> 5155.12
down that were about kind of fakery from

5153.36 --> 5156.239
government concerning space program

5155.12 --> 5158.0
situations

5156.239 --> 5160.48
and there was this mysterious scene that

5158.0 --> 5162.48
wasn't even explained

5160.48 --> 5164.879999999999
where they would literally take a space

5162.48 --> 5166.718999999999
shuttle and then put a giant torch on it

5164.88 --> 5168.8
on the bottom and just kept burning and

5166.719 --> 5171.199
burning and burning and burning

5168.8 --> 5172.96
right why did they do that it wasn't

5171.199 --> 5175.759999999999
explained in the movie

5172.96 --> 5176.88
could it be because there is no burning

5175.76 --> 5178.96
re-entry

5176.88 --> 5182.0
and they just had to fake it they just

5178.96 --> 5184.8
had to heat it up

5182.0 --> 5187.04
so they could say look it went into

5184.8 --> 5190.320000000001
re-entry it's all burnt

5187.04 --> 5193.5199999999995
it had all that heat on it huh

5190.32 --> 5194.799999999999
that's in a movie that's literally in a

5193.52 --> 5197.679
movie

5194.8 --> 5199.12
without even addressing it they just

5197.679 --> 5202.0
show it

5199.12 --> 5204.639
they don't tell you why they do that in

5202.0 --> 5204.639
that movie

5205.04 --> 5212.48
why would they do that

5210.0 --> 5215.52
anyone if any one of you remember which

5212.48 --> 5215.5199999999995
movie i'm talking about

5216.639 --> 5225.84
i'm not sure which one it was

5230.639 --> 5237.12
thousands of people space x rocket burn

5233.76 --> 5238.08
during and who's supposedly been

5237.12 --> 5241.44
launched in the space

5238.08 --> 5244.5599999999995
sacral x rocket and yes

5241.44 --> 5247.5199999999995
anybody that's claimed to have gone into

5244.56 --> 5248.2390000000005
high earth orbit away from earth's

5247.52 --> 5252.080000000001
gravity

5248.239 --> 5254.638999999999
is a liar because that doesn't happen

5252.08 --> 5256.96
there is no point where suddenly

5254.639 --> 5258.0
relative density displacement stops

5256.96 --> 5261.199
happening or

5258.0 --> 5265.12
gravity if you will that doesn't exist

5261.199 --> 5265.12
it's uniform it's universal

5265.44 --> 5270.48
you can't stop falling if you're a

5268.719 --> 5272.4800000000005
denser than the air that's around you if

5270.48 --> 5274.239
that air gets even less dense you're

5272.48 --> 5281.839999999999
just gonna fall harder with less

5274.239 --> 5281.839999999999
friction to stop you

5286.48 --> 5289.839999999999
how high would you need to get to the 80

5289.199 --> 5292.799999999999
degrees

5289.84 --> 5296.8
mentioned well somewhere between here

5292.8 --> 5296.8
and where the moon is pre supposed to be

5296.96 --> 5299.52
that would do

5301.44 --> 5305.599999999999
but the thing is you would simply see a

5304.56 --> 5308.4800000000005
significant

5305.6 --> 5309.4400000000005
drop right and the idea of 80 degrees as

5308.48 --> 5312.239
i mentioned it

5309.44 --> 5312.799999999999
that's because eventually it's going to

5312.239 --> 5315.759999999999
have to

5312.8 --> 5316.719
look like a globe beneath you then you

5315.76 --> 5319.04
look down

5316.719 --> 5323.84
angle wise guess what 80 degrees so

5319.04 --> 5323.84
that's why i said 80 degrees right

5326.8 --> 5330.56
and it's probably going to be pretty

5328.239 --> 5331.678999999999
high up the thing is though there is no

5330.56 --> 5335.1990000000005
footage of that

5331.679 --> 5337.4400000000005
ever there is none

5335.199 --> 5338.4
the only footage that even suggests any

5337.44 --> 5341.44
of that is

5338.4 --> 5343.679
never shown from the ground

5341.44 --> 5346.638999999999
going up to that point it's always oh

5343.679 --> 5348.159
look oh we have the globe earth in the

5346.639 --> 5350.4800000000005
background

5348.159 --> 5352.08
and then something is moving right there

5350.48 --> 5355.04
as the globe is moving

5352.08 --> 5356.5599999999995
that's always how that is presented

5355.04 --> 5359.36
right

5356.56 --> 5362.2390000000005
that's not natural footage that that's a

5359.36 --> 5364.48
trickery setup

5362.239 --> 5366.4
in the real world if you go up the

5364.48 --> 5369.44
horizon doesn't keep dropping and

5366.4 --> 5372.5599999999995
dropping and dropping it doesn't

5369.44 --> 5379.839999999999
it drops to slightly below eye level

5372.56 --> 5379.84
and then it stays there

5400.48 --> 5407.839999999999
that's okay so that's the way you're

5402.56 --> 5407.84
you're good

5415.44 --> 5421.199
what about meteorites what are they i

5417.199 --> 5422.879999999999
don't know

5421.199 --> 5425.919999999999
i don't know where they're coming from

5422.88 --> 5428.56
exactly i don't know if there's actually

5425.92 --> 5429.36
more than just lights going across the

5428.56 --> 5432.159000000001
sky

5429.36 --> 5433.04
as kind of another celestial light based

5432.159 --> 5435.28
side effect

5433.04 --> 5437.44
just like all the other heavenly bodies

5435.28 --> 5441.599999999999
are just light

5437.44 --> 5444.96
so the typical falling star

5441.6 --> 5444.96
that you might see in the sky

5445.28 --> 5452.5599999999995
i don't think that's a physical thing

5449.12 --> 5455.76
now that doesn't mean that there is no

5452.56 --> 5458.719
big rock ever somehow

5455.76 --> 5459.360000000001
hitting the earth or exploding right

5458.719 --> 5462.639
above it

5459.36 --> 5464.159
like in what is it there it happened

5462.639 --> 5467.36
somewhere in russia

5464.159 --> 5469.12
supposedly where a meteor exploded right

5467.36 --> 5469.92
above a forest and then everything was

5469.12 --> 5472.8
leveled

5469.92 --> 5473.28
that thing so i don't know there might

5472.8 --> 5475.6
be

5473.28 --> 5477.36
something weird going on it's just one

5475.6 --> 5480.8
of the many mysteries that

5477.36 --> 5483.28
have to be figured out after you've

5480.8 --> 5487.6
bypassed the science fiction nonsense

5483.28 --> 5487.599999999999
that the heliocentrism gives you about

5488.84 --> 5491.84
it

5495.44 --> 5499.5199999999995
horizon drops without well there's an

5497.679 --> 5500.8
animation that's been going around for

5499.52 --> 5504.159000000001
five years

5500.8 --> 5508.2390000000005
stone monkey 3d i think last

5504.159 --> 5511.199
scene seen it from eric the base

5508.239 --> 5513.599999999999
where they literally just show you a 3d

5511.199 --> 5517.759999999999
animated wireframe setup

5513.6 --> 5521.04
of ascending above a flat plane

5517.76 --> 5522.56
and ascending above a ball and they show

5521.04 --> 5525.28
you the two animations

5522.56 --> 5526.719
right next to one another so you can see

5525.28 --> 5530.84
exactly

5526.719 --> 5534.32
what it is calculated to look like

5530.84 --> 5534.32
geometrically yeah

5534.4 --> 5537.679
that should be sufficient evidence to

5536.719 --> 5540.8
just know

5537.679 --> 5545.679
like that's what happens

5540.8 --> 5548.0
when you ascend from a ball

5545.679 --> 5550.639
it's going to drop the horizon the

5548.0 --> 5553.199
geometric horizon which a ball has

5550.639 --> 5554.2390000000005
is going to drop continually as you

5553.199 --> 5557.5199999999995
ascend

5554.239 --> 5560.159
yeah now in the real world or in the

5557.52 --> 5563.360000000001
animation that i just referenced

5560.159 --> 5566.638999999999
a flat plane doesn't do that

5563.36 --> 5575.839999999999
you ascend the horizon

5566.639 --> 5575.84
does not descend

5589.12 --> 5594.32
oh wow seems like zahas is currently

5592.639 --> 5596.639
stuck into the

5594.32 --> 5597.36
why would they do that how could they do

5596.639 --> 5601.04
that how can

5597.36 --> 5605.599999999999
so much be fake oh a lot

5601.04 --> 5605.6
can be fake a whole lot

5606.32 --> 5609.92
governments run on fake it's mind

5609.36 --> 5612.639
control

5609.92 --> 5613.92
fake is mind control and mind control is

5612.639 --> 5617.1990000000005
what they like

5613.92 --> 5620.4
they take away your grasp

5617.199 --> 5623.839999999999
on reality and then hand

5620.4 --> 5627.04
you what they want you

5623.84 --> 5629.92
to know and trust

5627.04 --> 5631.04
it's called mind control yeah there's a

5629.92 --> 5634.159
lot of it

5631.04 --> 5637.12
a lot it's getting worse

5634.159 --> 5639.92
yeah some new provable scams happening

5637.12 --> 5643.36
the the new eugenics project

5639.92 --> 5646.159
yeah of literally killing gullible

5643.36 --> 5647.199
stupid people that'll listen to any

5646.159 --> 5651.04
authority

5647.199 --> 5651.919999999999
no matter how evil oozingly evil and

5651.04 --> 5655.04
disgusting

5651.92 --> 5655.6
and admittedly vile they are they'll do

5655.04 --> 5658.4
it they'll

5655.6 --> 5659.280000000001
[ __ ] kill themselves because they

5658.4 --> 5662.96
can't

5659.28 --> 5664.239
handle the truth they'll kill themselves

5662.96 --> 5666.8
for the dream

5664.239 --> 5667.28
that there's no evil and government is

5666.8 --> 5670.84
good

5667.28 --> 5674.239
they'll kill themselves for that

5670.84 --> 5677.679
sahas do you realize that

5674.239 --> 5679.28
did you know that why would they do that

5677.679 --> 5681.92
how could they do that

5679.28 --> 5684.239
it's because it's control it's business

5681.92 --> 5686.0
it's a lot of freaking money

5684.239 --> 5688.08
when slaves don't know what the [ __ ]

5686.0 --> 5689.92
they're doing and they're just doing

5688.08 --> 5694.32
whatever is handed to them

5689.92 --> 5697.36
then they can be utilized to make money

5694.32 --> 5701.44
and more power as

5697.36 --> 5703.759999999999
slaves for the mind controllers

5701.44 --> 5705.119
and well when the mind controllers

5703.76 --> 5707.52
decide

5705.119 --> 5708.799999999999
then they can be manipulated into

5707.52 --> 5710.4800000000005
killing themselves

5708.8 --> 5712.159000000001
out of their own stupidity and

5710.48 --> 5715.839999999999
trustingness yeah

5712.159 --> 5715.839999999999
that's how it works

5726.719 --> 5733.119
so yeah if they can fake a pandemic

5730.719 --> 5734.159
if they can make a vaccine that is not a

5733.119 --> 5736.88
vaccine

5734.159 --> 5737.759999999999
and get everybody to complain to

5736.88 --> 5741.1990000000005
government why

5737.76 --> 5743.52
aren't we getting these self-execution

5741.199 --> 5744.96
devices yet why don't we get the vaccine

5743.52 --> 5746.88
that's not a vaccine that's not going to

5744.96 --> 5749.28
help against the thing that isn't even

5746.88 --> 5751.76
real but if it was real it wouldn't help

5749.28 --> 5752.4
why can't we get that yet why can't we

5751.76 --> 5755.360000000001
die

5752.4 --> 5756.08
yet yeah so if that's the case why would

5755.36 --> 5759.679
you see any

5756.08 --> 5762.08
problems with fakery

5759.679 --> 5763.679
to make people believe the earth is a

5762.08 --> 5766.4
ball in space

5763.679 --> 5767.84
and make records amounts of money from

5766.4 --> 5771.599999999999
it

5767.84 --> 5774.639
record amounts of money

5771.6 --> 5779.52
faking space is extremely profitable

5774.639 --> 5782.4800000000005
because cgi and trickery is really cheap

5779.52 --> 5782.96
but it's supposed to be so expensive and

5782.48 --> 5786.159
all the

5782.96 --> 5787.119
difficulty and oh it's always a rough

5786.159 --> 5789.44
terrain and

5787.119 --> 5791.199
after calculating yeah yeah yeah so just

5789.44 --> 5792.5599999999995
you hand us the freaking billions

5791.199 --> 5795.28
already yeah

5792.56 --> 5797.04
we deserve it it's so it's so tough only

5795.28 --> 5798.4
we can do we're the rocket scientist so

5797.04 --> 5801.6
hand us your [ __ ]

5798.4 --> 5805.04
billions right now then we can

5801.6 --> 5806.56
quickly slap together some cgi [ __ ]

5805.04 --> 5808.32
excuse

5806.56 --> 5810.0
and then tell you a story about oh yeah

5808.32 --> 5812.239
it's going to take another 20 years

5810.0 --> 5813.44
is it going to take another 20 years ah

5812.239 --> 5815.119
oh yeah

5813.44 --> 5816.799999999999
oh yeah and in 20 years they're gonna

5815.119 --> 5818.639
say the same [ __ ] thing

5816.8 --> 5822.56
but you still have to hand them their

5818.639 --> 5822.56
regular billions though

5837.36 --> 5843.28
yeah voice of reason and how much is

5839.44 --> 5843.28
that how much is that exactly

5845.92 --> 5854.08
yes cgi is [ __ ] cheap it is cheap

5849.76 --> 5855.76
yeah you know why it's cheap because

5854.08 --> 5858.0
look at science fiction

5855.76 --> 5860.0
look look at all the freaking convincing

5858.0 --> 5862.08
animations of space and [ __ ]

5860.0 --> 5863.92
yeah that took millions right it took

5862.08 --> 5867.119
millions to do that

5863.92 --> 5867.76
didn't take billions yeah that's like a

5867.119 --> 5871.5199999999995
factor

5867.76 --> 5875.04
1000 roughly estimated

5871.52 --> 5883.84
yeah that's a lot of profit that's a lot

5875.04 --> 5883.84
of [ __ ] profit there

5919.199 --> 5922.879999999999
all right anyway i'm gonna take a two

5921.28 --> 5925.84
minute break i'll be back

5922.88 --> 5925.84
two minutes

5978.84 --> 5981.84
hmm

6034.84 --> 6037.84
ah

6043.679 --> 6050.0
yeah well come on man

6047.92 --> 6052.0
dude you you obviously haven't been

6050.0 --> 6055.36
paying attention

6052.0 --> 6058.239
a preponderance of supposed launches

6055.36 --> 6058.799999999999
witnessing that doesn't make any of it

6058.239 --> 6061.04
true

6058.8 --> 6064.0
they are actively faking this [ __ ]

6061.04 --> 6065.679
that's that's what we're saying and

6064.0 --> 6068.56
there's people that have dedicated

6065.679 --> 6072.08
significant amount of time

6068.56 --> 6072.56
in revealing exactly how not everybody

6072.08 --> 6075.6
is as

6072.56 --> 6078.080000000001
proficient at it it's a lot of time

6075.6 --> 6081.119000000001
being spent on explaining the details of

6078.08 --> 6082.719
why not even motivation-wise or

6081.119 --> 6086.08
money-wise but just like

6082.719 --> 6088.2390000000005
how has it been faked exactly

6086.08 --> 6089.119
how are things being faked what part is

6088.239 --> 6092.799999999999
faked

6089.119 --> 6095.44
where do they enter enter the cgi

6092.8 --> 6096.719
when just like what is it like what are

6095.44 --> 6101.839999999999
these rockets

6096.719 --> 6101.84
right what are they they're not rockets

6102.239 --> 6108.799999999999
right they're basically rocket propelled

6106.159 --> 6108.799999999999
balloons

6109.92 --> 6114.8
because it's very light that way you can

6112.8 --> 6117.92
make it quite spectacular

6114.8 --> 6119.679
and it's dirt cheap right

6117.92 --> 6121.6
because balloons are very light you need

6119.679 --> 6123.36
less rocket fuel

6121.6 --> 6125.360000000001
doesn't have to go anywhere it just has

6123.36 --> 6127.5199999999995
to show the display

6125.36 --> 6130.0
so it's kind of like an over budgeted

6127.52 --> 6134.4800000000005
piece of fireworks

6130.0 --> 6136.239
that's what those rocket launches are

6134.48 --> 6138.879999999999
as for the x yeah now we're talking

6136.239 --> 6141.5199999999995
about the more classic stuff

6138.88 --> 6143.6
with the spacex things i'm not entirely

6141.52 --> 6146.8
even sure what that is

6143.6 --> 6148.719
those landing rockets and i

6146.8 --> 6150.719
i don't really understand what they're

6148.719 --> 6156.2390000000005
really doing how much of that

6150.719 --> 6156.2390000000005
is cgi and what is actual i don't know

6156.56 --> 6162.320000000001
it's fairly recent all of that

6160.0 --> 6165.36
what i do know however is that space is

6162.32 --> 6167.759999999999
fake it's physically impossible

6165.36 --> 6169.599999999999
so it doesn't matter how much cgi you

6167.76 --> 6171.360000000001
see how many series you see how many

6169.6 --> 6172.400000000001
books you read how many stories you

6171.36 --> 6174.839999999999
heard

6172.4 --> 6178.719
outer space is impossible it's

6174.84 --> 6183.1990000000005
physically impossible

6178.719 --> 6185.679
impossible you see it's not possible

6183.199 --> 6186.799999999999
every explanation you ever heard to try

6185.679 --> 6189.6
and justify

6186.8 --> 6191.119000000001
it from being possible is a fraud

6189.6 --> 6195.84
provably so

6191.119 --> 6195.839999999999
because it isn't possible not at all

6196.0 --> 6202.8
has to be a limited volume to the

6199.44 --> 6205.28
realm or you wouldn't have air pressure

6202.8 --> 6206.56
and what you think might solve it

6205.28 --> 6210.239
suppose it gravity

6206.56 --> 6213.6
can't solve it even within your own

6210.239 --> 6214.239
presupposit presuppositional calculation

6213.6 --> 6216.88
systems

6214.239 --> 6217.44
it doesn't do it it can't do it you

6216.88 --> 6220.400000000001
can't

6217.44 --> 6221.199
model gravity to keep the gas pressure

6220.4 --> 6223.599999999999
to the earth

6221.199 --> 6225.759999999999
you can't do it that's why nobody does

6223.6 --> 6227.76
it because it doesn't work out

6225.76 --> 6230.320000000001
right it would have to be freaking black

6227.76 --> 6233.1990000000005
hole strength and beyond

6230.32 --> 6234.159
for in order for the gravity to somehow

6233.199 --> 6236.239
keep the gas

6234.159 --> 6237.199
to that ball while crushing everything

6236.239 --> 6240.799999999999
else of course

6237.199 --> 6245.04
it's impossible gravity as a concept

6240.8 --> 6247.84
cannot hold the gas pressure to the ball

6245.04 --> 6247.84
it's impossible

6248.719 --> 6253.199
even when calculating it overlooking

6251.76 --> 6256.4800000000005
whether it is real or not

6253.199 --> 6258.32
it's impossible yeah

6256.48 --> 6259.599999999999
it can't happen outer space is

6258.32 --> 6262.719
impossible

6259.6 --> 6265.6
cannot be it's not possible

6262.719 --> 6267.28
who knows how big the realm is how far

6265.6 --> 6269.360000000001
up you can go

6267.28 --> 6271.5199999999995
how much space there is one thing is

6269.36 --> 6275.04
sure it's all

6271.52 --> 6278.8
filled with gas pressure it is contained

6275.04 --> 6281.36
there is no endless vacuum of space

6278.8 --> 6283.360000000001
with other solar systems and other

6281.36 --> 6289.839999999999
earth-like planets out there

6283.36 --> 6289.839999999999
that is physically impossible

6309.119 --> 6314.4
yes it is physically impossible yeah

6312.32 --> 6316.4
outcomes razor does not apply

6314.4 --> 6317.44
just because you see things and listen

6316.4 --> 6319.5199999999995
to stories

6317.44 --> 6320.719
about those things that you see and then

6319.52 --> 6322.76
believe them

6320.719 --> 6324.159
and then those stories were extra

6322.76 --> 6327.119000000001
translated

6324.159 --> 6328.638999999999
supported with cgi representations in

6327.119 --> 6331.28
order to reinforce

6328.639 --> 6332.4800000000005
the story belief yeah that doesn't prove

6331.28 --> 6335.759999999999
it

6332.48 --> 6336.32
it doesn't it's just lights all we see

6335.76 --> 6339.04
out there

6336.32 --> 6339.759999999999
are lights very mysterious extremely

6339.04 --> 6342.4
mysterious

6339.76 --> 6344.0
the most mysterious phenomena i've ever

6342.4 --> 6346.879999999999
freaking come across in the freaking

6344.0 --> 6348.239
world yeah because they're not even in

6346.88 --> 6351.28
positions

6348.239 --> 6352.239
they're not even euclidean lamps hanging

6351.28 --> 6353.92
up there or anything

6352.239 --> 6355.44
it's just light coming from that

6353.92 --> 6358.08
direction and then you go to that

6355.44 --> 6360.239
direction and then it bends away because

6358.08 --> 6362.48
it's not coming from a specific point

6360.239 --> 6364.0
in space even within the realm it's just

6362.48 --> 6366.799999999999
light manifest and it looks

6364.0 --> 6367.199
weird the freaking moon is weird that

6366.8 --> 6369.04
light

6367.199 --> 6370.96
because it is a light and when you go

6369.04 --> 6374.239
towards it it bends away

6370.96 --> 6376.08
physical objects don't do that yeah it's

6374.239 --> 6379.119
really weird

6376.08 --> 6381.44
it's not outer space however that's

6379.119 --> 6383.679
absolutely impossible and there's no

6381.44 --> 6385.599999999999
proof for it other than a whole bunch of

6383.679 --> 6401.84
stories and cgi to

6385.6 --> 6401.84
represent those stories

6402.98 --> 6408.638999999999
[Music]

6405.04 --> 6408.639
oh god look who's there

6408.96 --> 6412.32
what are you gonna prove gas pressure

6410.96 --> 6414.88
without a container with

6412.32 --> 6416.639
using two containers again blue marble

6414.88 --> 6419.1990000000005
science

6416.639 --> 6419.679
you're gonna go there again yeah and the

6419.199 --> 6422.159
g

6419.679 --> 6423.84
supposedly works now it doesn't it only

6422.159 --> 6426.638999999999
works if you completely

6423.84 --> 6428.88
ignore physics and gas law you just

6426.639 --> 6432.8
start to calculate everything based on

6428.88 --> 6436.0
weight through emit newtonian mechanisms

6432.8 --> 6439.04
that ignore gas they

6436.0 --> 6440.96
ignore it they completely overlook it

6439.04 --> 6442.719
they don't look at it oh it's invisible

6440.96 --> 6443.199
you know we don't need to think about it

6442.719 --> 6446.8
just

6443.199 --> 6450.799999999999
work with the liquids work with

6446.8 --> 6452.639
the physical things the sorry the solids

6450.8 --> 6453.92
and that's good enough yeah that's what

6452.639 --> 6456.639
that's based on

6453.92 --> 6458.639
right if you completely ignore like

6456.639 --> 6460.0
surgically remove the natural

6458.639 --> 6463.28
consequences of gas

6460.0 --> 6467.199
existing yeah then you might be able to

6463.28 --> 6470.159
calculate in a machination based model

6467.199 --> 6471.36
that weight the weight of air might

6470.159 --> 6474.48
cause it to push

6471.36 --> 6476.32
down a little on top keeping it to the

6474.48 --> 6476.799999999999
ball yeah that's not physically possible

6476.32 --> 6478.799999999999
though

6476.8 --> 6480.56
because gas doesn't behave like that it

6478.8 --> 6481.92
expands in all directions to fill the

6480.56 --> 6484.8
available volume

6481.92 --> 6486.4800000000005
and earth the earth's sphere in the

6484.8 --> 6488.4800000000005
outer space is supposed to be an open

6486.48 --> 6490.718999999999
system so there's nothing preventing it

6488.48 --> 6492.239
from expanding in all directions to fill

6490.719 --> 6495.36
the available volume which is

6492.239 --> 6498.718999999999
said to be endless

6495.36 --> 6501.92
and less volume yeah

6498.719 --> 6504.4800000000005
it's supposed to be an endless volume

6501.92 --> 6505.52
there is no force in the universe that

6504.48 --> 6507.759999999999
could prevent

6505.52 --> 6509.52
the gas expanding in all directions to

6507.76 --> 6511.52
try and fill it never reaching it

6509.52 --> 6512.56
there is no force in the universe that

6511.52 --> 6515.119000000001
could achieve this

6512.56 --> 6516.4800000000005
even theoretically yeah because an

6515.119 --> 6520.159
endless volume means

6516.48 --> 6523.28
endless gas pressure expansion force

6520.159 --> 6524.32
because the way gas expands in all

6523.28 --> 6527.48
directions

6524.32 --> 6529.44
the force with which it does that is

6527.48 --> 6532.48
proportional

6529.44 --> 6535.04
to the volume it's going to

6532.48 --> 6535.919999999999
expand into why don't you look it up in

6535.04 --> 6539.04
the math

6535.92 --> 6539.04
and know i'm right

6539.199 --> 6544.719
it's not possible yeah it's not possible

6542.239 --> 6546.799999999999
gravity cannot hold gas pressure to a

6544.719 --> 6554.4800000000005
ball even if it were real

6546.8 --> 6556.4800000000005
it's impossible

6554.48 --> 6558.159
it's the force of gravity it's called

6556.48 --> 6560.959999999999
gravity yes

6558.159 --> 6560.96
oh my god

6561.92 --> 6564.96
oh that was a freudian slip there

6563.84 --> 6567.04
because there's actually

6564.96 --> 6568.8
baller zealots that have actually said

6567.04 --> 6573.5199999999995
that that's hilarious

6568.8 --> 6573.52
so i had the way this is

6574.88 --> 6578.88
gases are affected by gravity except

6576.8 --> 6581.04
they're not except they're not

6578.88 --> 6582.32
gas expands in all directions right if

6581.04 --> 6586.159
there's no container

6582.32 --> 6589.44
limit to cause it to stabilize

6586.159 --> 6591.759999999999
yeah to settle within the container yeah

6589.44 --> 6593.199
gravity is going to have no impact

6591.76 --> 6594.96
whatsoever

6593.199 --> 6596.879999999999
because gravity is supposed to be a weak

6594.96 --> 6597.84
force right oh it's not a force actually

6596.88 --> 6599.599
oh but

6597.84 --> 6601.52
let's just give it to you yeah let's

6599.599 --> 6604.2390000000005
just say gravity is a force

6601.52 --> 6606.56
yeah i'm giving you so much i'm being so

6604.239 --> 6608.0
unbelievably generous to your delusion

6606.56 --> 6610.56
right now

6608.0 --> 6612.159
but you don't even see that right let's

6610.56 --> 6613.84
just say gravity's a force it can't do

6612.159 --> 6615.92
it it's not strong enough it's very weak

6613.84 --> 6618.1990000000005
force gas pressure expansion

6615.92 --> 6620.56
within the available volume however is

6618.199 --> 6623.04
astronomically strong

6620.56 --> 6624.96
and the bigger the container it is in

6623.04 --> 6627.36
which it has to expand the stronger the

6624.96 --> 6631.44
force by which it expands

6627.36 --> 6634.239
yeah you don't think about that a lot

6631.44 --> 6634.96
maybe you should because that's physical

6634.239 --> 6638.5599999999995
reality

6634.96 --> 6641.84
that's empirically proven fact

6638.56 --> 6645.599
scientific fact yeah physicists

6641.84 --> 6648.88
worked that out in the last 200 years

6645.599 --> 6652.0
with with scientific method yeah

6648.88 --> 6655.04
they did it they proved it

6652.0 --> 6656.8
it's real that is real you can't

6655.04 --> 6658.4
disprove it you can't demonstrate

6656.8 --> 6660.4800000000005
anything that disproves that

6658.4 --> 6662.719
through empirical based evidence or you

6660.48 --> 6664.638999999999
could cgi it you could tell a great

6662.719 --> 6668.56
story how it is possible

6664.639 --> 6670.400000000001
you could even create a straw man model

6668.56 --> 6672.719
for reality itself and claim that

6670.4 --> 6675.199
atmosphere is different from air

6672.719 --> 6676.2390000000005
doesn't abide by the gas laws because

6675.199 --> 6679.28
its atmosphere

6676.239 --> 6681.119
it's the air on the globe model

6679.28 --> 6684.08
in which it doesn't work the way it does

6681.119 --> 6695.839999999999
in reality yeah you could do all that

6684.08 --> 6695.84
it's not gonna make it real though

6698.8 --> 6704.0
well sahas the way you don't know basic

6702.08 --> 6706.0
math if you're gonna make that claim

6704.0 --> 6707.84
if you say that gravity is supposedly

6706.0 --> 6709.599
the weakest of forces which is something

6707.84 --> 6710.159000000001
that's been said for a lot quite a long

6709.599 --> 6713.84
time

6710.159 --> 6714.719
right in the circles universities and

6713.84 --> 6716.400000000001
all that

6714.719 --> 6718.08
but if you're gonna then say it's strong

6716.4 --> 6721.199
enough to keep you

6718.08 --> 6722.8
no no it's not

6721.199 --> 6724.719
it's not going to keep the gas on it

6722.8 --> 6728.2390000000005
yeah it's not going to do that because

6724.719 --> 6728.2390000000005
the gas expands in all directions

6728.719 --> 6732.719
yeah gravity is not a container gravity

6731.52 --> 6735.280000000001
doesn't

6732.719 --> 6736.639
form a barrier on which the gas

6735.28 --> 6739.92
expanding in all directions

6736.639 --> 6742.56
is going to bounce off

6739.92 --> 6743.52
in order to stabilize the pressure

6742.56 --> 6746.88
within a set

6743.52 --> 6750.2390000000005
volume gravity doesn't do that

6746.88 --> 6752.639
yes right

6750.239 --> 6754.239
what it's going to nudge going to nudge

6752.639 --> 6756.88
the gas in another direction

6754.239 --> 6758.718999999999
going to push slightly it's not going to

6756.88 --> 6760.08
form a container so it yeah that gas

6758.719 --> 6761.119
pressure expanding in all directions

6760.08 --> 6764.96
still going to have to

6761.119 --> 6768.08
deal with the endless volume

6764.96 --> 6769.679
out there to which the gas pressure

6768.08 --> 6772.88
expansion

6769.679 --> 6776.159
force will be proportional

6772.88 --> 6778.32
yeah so that weak gravity force

6776.159 --> 6780.48
is not going to form a barrier that's

6778.32 --> 6782.719
going to effectively contain

6780.48 --> 6784.08
the gas pressure so it's going to have

6782.719 --> 6787.199
to push

6784.08 --> 6790.48
back very weakly against the

6787.199 --> 6792.48
endless gas pressure expansion force

6790.48 --> 6794.959999999999
which is proportional to the volume it's

6792.48 --> 6798.159
expanding into which is said to be

6794.96 --> 6801.92
endless outer space volume yeah

6798.159 --> 6804.839999999999
so no gravity is not

6801.92 --> 6807.84
strong enough to keep the gas to the

6804.84 --> 6807.84
ball

6808.239 --> 6816.0
all right i'm gonna round out the show

6812.8 --> 6816.8
drama on long enough made my points made

6816.0 --> 6821.599
them clear

6816.8 --> 6826.08
i hope you all appreciate that

6821.599 --> 6829.119000000001
so if you like this show

6826.08 --> 6830.96
please don't forget to rogan's it up and

6836.96 --> 6839.76
weekdays and 2 p.m amsterdam time in the

6839.04 --> 6842.239
weekend

6839.76 --> 6843.04
and please also do support me through

6842.239 --> 6845.839999999999
the paypal

6843.04 --> 6849.36
patreon crypto wallets super chat and

6845.84 --> 6852.0
the membership system join button

6849.36 --> 6853.759999999999
what's over there different setup div

6852.0 --> 6855.52
complicated oh by the way i think that's

6853.76 --> 6857.599
somebody i'm not sure but i think

6855.52 --> 6858.639
somebody actually donated some bitcoin

6857.599 --> 6862.32
to me

6858.639 --> 6863.92
for like worth 15 euros or something

6862.32 --> 6865.5199999999995
i checked it out i'm not sure who did

6863.92 --> 6868.2390000000005
that maybe it was the guy who said

6865.52 --> 6869.4400000000005
he was gonna do that yesterday but

6868.239 --> 6873.598999999999
thanks

6869.44 --> 6875.36
that's pretty cool i appreciate that

6873.599 --> 6876.8
and please everybody keep the support

6875.36 --> 6877.92
coming i'm still kind of in a

6876.8 --> 6881.599
financially

6877.92 --> 6883.599
tight spot i need i really urgently need

6881.599 --> 6886.8
to work away certain types of debts

6883.599 --> 6888.88
i can't it can't be held off any longer

6886.8 --> 6891.4400000000005
and i'm trying to really cut down also

6888.88 --> 6893.92
on my costs

6891.44 --> 6896.08
reducing my cannabis intake and it's

6893.92 --> 6898.8
doable

6896.08 --> 6899.679
but i still need your support to really

6898.8 --> 6902.639
get through this

6899.679 --> 6904.56
so please consider donating to my paypal

6902.639 --> 6906.08
especially or becoming a patreon member

6904.56 --> 6909.679
or i don't know

6906.08 --> 6913.04
dump a bit of crypto in my wallet

6909.679 --> 6915.36
everything helps even little bits right

6913.04 --> 6919.04
so anyway i will be back tomorrow flat

6915.36 --> 6920.32
earth early bird number 829

6919.04 --> 6922.159
and i'm gonna join the flat earth

6920.32 --> 6923.28
debates which should start up any minute

6922.159 --> 6928.08
now

6923.28 --> 6928.08
until the next video keep it

6930.84 --> 6941.2
flat

6933.05 --> 6941.8
