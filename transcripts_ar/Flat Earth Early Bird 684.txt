see you in chat

159.76 --> 166.239
you know the best contribution

162.959 --> 166.72
for me is to yeah have people active in

166.239 --> 168.84
chat

166.72 --> 171.84
because that really helps me going as

168.84 --> 171.84
well

172.4 --> 177.76000000000002
but nothing yeah it's a 50 50.

it's raining sort of

211.76 --> 216.239
it's yeah it's not very big drops but

214.159 --> 217.44
it's like this misery type of rain

216.239 --> 220.72
constantly

217.44 --> 220.72
my window is kind of wet

223.2 --> 230.879
and it's been kind of like that

226.239 --> 235.28
most of the night sometimes a little bit

230.879 --> 238.239
more rain bigger drops

235.28 --> 240.0
but yeah i did manage to get my

238.239 --> 243.519
newspaper around

240.0 --> 245.68
out yesterday without catching any rain

243.519 --> 247.92000000000002
and yeah very happy that i managed to do

245.68 --> 247.92000000000002
that

248.64 --> 252.83999999999997
yeah because yeah most of the day it was

251.2 --> 256.799
kind of raining

252.84 --> 256.799
so hey

257.04 --> 263.04
tom parker patricia dockery

260.079 --> 263.04
and the man young

264.96 --> 269.84
plants need rain yeah yeah

270.24 --> 283.84000000000003
of course they do

291.52 --> 298.71999999999997
right anyway it's thursday

296.4 --> 298.71999999999997
um

299.68 --> 303.039
yeah and yesterday uh

303.28 --> 309.19899999999996
didn't go to bed too late

306.479 --> 310.0
i'm really keeping this momentum going

309.199 --> 312.24
as much as i

310.0 --> 312.24
can

314.32 --> 318.15999999999997
right the flat of debates was pretty

316.32 --> 320.8
good

318.16 --> 322.84000000000003
brought out my fallacy pioneers concept

320.8 --> 324.0
well it's not the first time i've said

322.84 --> 326.56
that

324.0 --> 328.4
but i think it's going to stick and it's

326.56 --> 330.56
really what's going on it's a funny way

328.4 --> 330.56
to

331.12 --> 335.36
like as is yes

337.039 --> 339.84
it's an analogy

342.32 --> 346.88
is it that what it is i lost the word

345.6 --> 349.68
for a moment as what

346.88 --> 349.68
what you call that

350.639 --> 355.44
way as a symbolic way i guess or a

353.12 --> 358.639
metaphorical way

355.44 --> 361.84
to represent a

358.639 --> 365.28000000000003
well a not so visible complex

361.84 --> 366.88
and complex situation to basically

365.28 --> 370.08
highlight the structure by

366.88 --> 371.36
giving you comparisons to similar

370.08 --> 374.08
situation

371.36 --> 374.8
situations like the time of the

374.08 --> 380.0
pioneering

374.8 --> 381.919
they they went out into the wildlands

380.0 --> 384.479
and yeah that was pretty cr that was

381.919 --> 387.35999999999996
regarded as pretty crazy

384.479 --> 389.039
in a way yeah not also brave but also it

387.36 --> 391.6
was so dangerous

389.039 --> 393.44
they you didn't know what to expect but

391.6 --> 394.0
they would brave it anyway and yeah a

393.44 --> 397.6
lot of did

394.0 --> 400.96
perish well the ballers now seem like

397.6 --> 404.8
fallacy pioneers they're like the first

400.96 --> 404.79999999999995
to claim the fallacy grounds

405.28 --> 409.44
like they don't want to let the flat

408.16 --> 413.199
earthers us

409.44 --> 415.36
nathan oakley yeah the technical works

413.199 --> 417.12
they don't want us to basically build

415.36 --> 420.88
these

417.12 --> 423.52
dams like my for example my figuring out

420.88 --> 426.56
of the

423.52 --> 427.75899999999996
the paradox of terrestrial refraction

426.56 --> 431.199
they don't like that so

427.759 --> 435.68
they are going to claim

431.199 --> 437.52000000000004
new fallacy ground every time

435.68 --> 439.039
like they're getting a feel for this

437.52 --> 441.19899999999996
guys like

439.039 --> 442.479
we are like every time slapping our

441.199 --> 445.84000000000003
faces like what

442.479 --> 447.599
are you serious well for them they're

445.84 --> 449.52
ignoring that and they're just keeping

447.599 --> 450.319
it going and they're getting a feel for

449.52 --> 455.28
it so they're

450.319 --> 455.28000000000003
yeah fallacy pioneers

458.0 --> 461.12
idiots we did with the new settlers we

460.479 --> 466.24
will rape

461.12 --> 466.24
them with r among others

468.8 --> 473.919
yeah the uh a small level small letter r

472.16 --> 479.84000000000003
kind of does look like a uh

473.919 --> 479.84
a mohawk doesn't it a little bit

480.72 --> 485.68
[Music]

481.84 --> 485.67999999999995
all right you call that a tomahawk

486.319 --> 495.599
but uh yeah

492.0 --> 495.599
it it's funny how it works

497.84 --> 506.31899999999996
didn't want to necessarily get all grim

500.08 --> 509.19899999999996
in the historic details of that

506.319 --> 511.84000000000003
but yeah i also like to call it pioneers

509.199 --> 514.24
because to them from their perspective

511.84 --> 516.0799999999999
that's kind of the dream that they're

514.24 --> 519.76
holding on to they

516.08 --> 523.839
as globers as futurists they want to be

519.76 --> 525.76
pioneers they want that grandness of

523.839 --> 528.9590000000001
futurism

525.76 --> 531.8389999999999
so if they're really going for it

528.959 --> 535.5999999999999
against all odds against real yeah

531.839 --> 539.0400000000001
trying to break reality itself

535.6 --> 543.6
yeah they feel like pioneers

539.04 --> 546.88
but in reality it's when you look at the

543.6 --> 548.24
non-dream for filled in variant of what

546.88 --> 552.08
they're doing

548.24 --> 554.08
then it's just more ridiculous fallacy

552.08 --> 557.9200000000001
statements

554.08 --> 561.279
stepping further away from sound logic

557.92 --> 562.0
every time fallacy pioneers they're

561.279 --> 564.959
digging their

562.0 --> 567.2
way to the center of their presupposed

564.959 --> 567.1999999999999
earth

573.2 --> 578.9590000000001
they circle the wagons but our rides

576.64 --> 578.959
again

579.6 --> 583.839
oh that's hilarious stuff in traffic

581.36 --> 585.04
arrest that anyway thank you alexander

583.839 --> 591.839
for the

585.04 --> 591.8389999999999
99 rsd i forgot it oh yeah it's uh

592.64 --> 597.279
it's a south african currency if i

594.88 --> 599.76
remember correctly

597.279 --> 602.0
anyway thank you and good servant for

599.76 --> 605.8389999999999
the 99 cent super chat donation

602.0 --> 605.839
much appreciated

611.12 --> 619.839
oh siberian dinner what really

615.279 --> 619.8389999999999
rupees what

628.8 --> 633.8389999999999
serbian really huh

636.24 --> 644.48
right okay

639.76 --> 646.959
i didn't realize that i mixed it up

644.48 --> 647.839
i i didn't know they had their own

646.959 --> 652.0
currency that

647.839 --> 652.0
they didn't use the euro huh

656.32 --> 662.6400000000001
[Music]

658.959 --> 664.399
anyway it's yeah i don't know

662.64 --> 666.959
i'm not too familiar about the whole

664.399 --> 669.44
political landscape in europe

666.959 --> 669.4399999999999
like that

670.959 --> 674.3199999999999
or at least yeah there's been all this

672.8 --> 676.3199999999999
hassle in yugoslavia

674.32 --> 679.0400000000001
and all that and i think that serbia is

676.32 --> 682.72
like used to be a part of that

679.04 --> 682.7199999999999
so yeah

686.24 --> 690.8
that's probably the reason why they

687.68 --> 690.8
don't have the euro

692.48 --> 701.279
that would be my my get my guesstimation

696.64 --> 703.8389999999999
uh but anyway thank you for joining the

701.279 --> 703.8389999999999
stream

704.399 --> 707.76
and hello hannah cowella

710.88 --> 717.8389999999999
yeah yeah oh that's obvious uh fe

714.839 --> 717.839
kaepernick

728.8 --> 734.959
you know technically the eu is still

731.839 --> 738.639
foundationally a currency union

734.959 --> 738.6389999999999
a currency and trade union

739.12 --> 744.24
that's what it started up to be and i

742.079 --> 748.4799999999999
thought it was a

744.24 --> 751.04
yeah it was a decent idea

748.48 --> 752.639
but then yeah they expanded and they got

751.04 --> 754.8
this stupid unelected

752.639 --> 756.0790000000001
european parliament [ __ ] going and all

754.8 --> 757.8389999999999
that

756.079 --> 761.279
and then it just could yeah then it just

757.839 --> 764.399
became stupid bureaucracy trying to

761.279 --> 765.92
in the name of economic fluidity i guess

764.399 --> 768.88
or

765.92 --> 770.56
protection like synchronize everything

768.88 --> 772.48
that means that everybody has to follow

770.56 --> 774.88
the same rules and then as soon as they

772.48 --> 777.2
got a momentum from enough countries

774.88 --> 778.72
then it started to really set a tone

777.2 --> 781.6800000000001
like and now

778.72 --> 783.839
we're gonna migrate the expectations

781.68 --> 786.7199999999999
even further

783.839 --> 788.8000000000001
and now we all gotta work towards

786.72 --> 790.48
becoming like this

788.8 --> 794.399
and then it became like the yeah the

790.48 --> 794.399
european version of globalism

795.76 --> 800.72
and that we got a problem and we're

797.6 --> 803.9200000000001
still working against it

800.72 --> 805.6
like everyone that

803.92 --> 807.8389999999999
knows what the hell is going on

805.6 --> 812.5600000000001
basically

807.839 --> 812.5600000000001
or doesn't have some vested interest

813.04 --> 829.8389999999999
in in yeah in the dark side

830.079 --> 836.8
hello michael snodgrass

835.199 --> 838.639
there's a lot of new people in chat

836.8 --> 840.7199999999999
that's funny

838.639 --> 842.48
how did you get to this channel all of a

840.72 --> 845.6800000000001
sudden i wonder because

842.48 --> 846.72
i recognize by the lack of troll

845.68 --> 848.4799999999999
signatures that

846.72 --> 851.1990000000001
they are real people so i'm wondering

848.48 --> 853.6800000000001
hey where did they come from

851.199 --> 856.0
i always have to ask it's it's like a

853.68 --> 859.199
professional obligation i need to know

856.0 --> 860.24
where where things come from where

859.199 --> 864.0
people

860.24 --> 866.24
come from hey a random explorer

864.0 --> 868.079
yeah by the way did i did get like

866.24 --> 869.04
another shout out from big bear

868.079 --> 872.079
yesterday i think

869.04 --> 872.399
well shout out another critical shout

872.079 --> 874.4799999999999
out

872.399 --> 878.72
i think it's the best he he's willing to

874.48 --> 878.72
give me considering i have no children

879.76 --> 885.8389999999999
he called me our widgeon

887.12 --> 892.079
nathan every morning all right so yeah

890.0 --> 894.399
through nathan okay well that'll do it

892.079 --> 896.399
nathan is really getting more attention

894.399 --> 897.6
growing wider because of the consistency

896.399 --> 900.56
because of

897.6 --> 902.0790000000001
taking on this rare role and being so

900.56 --> 905.1199999999999
good at it

902.079 --> 908.7199999999999
so yeah i am riding a lot

905.12 --> 910.8
on that as well and i am expanding upon

908.72 --> 913.519
it as well i hope

910.8 --> 914.399
i really do consider myself as a worthy

913.519 --> 918.9590000000001
cohort

914.399 --> 918.959
as to nathan's project

925.04 --> 931.04
this is okay stop a traffic hit my

928.399 --> 931.04
rastat

932.32 --> 937.44
oh well i know exactly what he's gonna

934.959 --> 937.4399999999999
do though

938.16 --> 943.68
you know you do

941.36 --> 944.48
realize he's aware you're out there and

943.68 --> 947.68
he has

944.48 --> 950.0790000000001
his defense

947.68 --> 952.56
attitude against it so you're not really

950.079 --> 955.04
gonna break through to him

952.56 --> 956.4799999999999
he's just gonna make it look like you're

955.04 --> 961.04
an angry

956.48 --> 969.839
younger guy ranting against an old man

961.04 --> 969.8389999999999
that's what he would do in reality

974.56 --> 977.64
[Applause]

993.44 --> 996.72
all right well michael snodgrass so glad

995.759 --> 1001.92
to hear it

996.72 --> 1001.9200000000001
glad to hear that it's good to be

1008.839 --> 1011.839
appreciated

1015.59 --> 1018.719
[Music]

1022.839 --> 1025.839
mm-hmm

1026.48 --> 1029.919
yeah yeah rest ahead you're gonna have

1028.64 --> 1032.88
to con

1029.919 --> 1036.16
reconcile that nobody's gonna stop

1032.88 --> 1039.439
tenthman from using his old man tactics

1036.16 --> 1042.959
when he feels like it or to just

1039.439 --> 1046.0
be like that

1042.959 --> 1050.3200000000002
but you can call him out

1046.0 --> 1053.679
on [ __ ] moments if you just

1050.32 --> 1056.72
pointed out very sharply and don't let

1053.679 --> 1060.16
the the situation turn into

1056.72 --> 1060.16
a hassle or an argument

1060.64 --> 1066.48
and then that actually does work

1064.0 --> 1067.76
just call out people's bluffs and

1066.48 --> 1070.72
bullshits or point

1067.76 --> 1072.559
yeah just point it out in a careful way

1070.72 --> 1073.2
if you're gonna take on a hostile

1072.559 --> 1075.6
attitude

1073.2 --> 1077.679
when pointing it out then there's a

1075.6 --> 1080.48
whole chain of events that will

1077.679 --> 1082.4
follow that up always it will because

1080.48 --> 1083.84
you've engaged in a certain spiritual

1082.4 --> 1087.679
chemistry

1083.84 --> 1088.799
and then the aftermath determines much

1087.679 --> 1091.8400000000001
more as to

1088.799 --> 1095.12
what the consequences will be rather

1091.84 --> 1098.32
than the actual origin point moment

1095.12 --> 1101.52
unless you do not engage

1098.32 --> 1103.2
in a hostile way and just very calmly

1101.52 --> 1106.32
sharply point it out

1103.2 --> 1106.32
that's hey

1106.559 --> 1110.24
we already know how to use these tactics

1108.96 --> 1113.679
against ballers

1110.24 --> 1118.88
if you can find the patience

1113.679 --> 1122.16
you know some people can't right kiwi

1118.88 --> 1125.1200000000001
now although sometimes he does manage

1122.16 --> 1127.679
but most of the time he's just yeah you

1125.12 --> 1127.6789999999999
know what i mean

1132.48 --> 1136.88
stop at traffic mrs that that's that's a

1135.12 --> 1140.9599999999998
terrible longing

1136.88 --> 1144.0
that's a that's a terrible image to have

1140.96 --> 1145.3600000000001
and it's never gonna work you know that

1144.0 --> 1147.36
might have worked like

1145.36 --> 1149.36
60 years ago when he was a kid or

1147.36 --> 1151.1999999999998
something that's not going gonna work

1149.36 --> 1153.12
anymore he probably did

1151.2 --> 1155.039
go through that and that is what made

1153.12 --> 1160.4799999999998
him such a

1155.039 --> 1160.48
hardened in his social conduct

1162.84 --> 1165.84
so

1172.4 --> 1174.88
you're right

1177.679 --> 1180.88
hey and you can always add homing in

1179.6 --> 1184.0
chat you know

1180.88 --> 1186.0800000000002
you do realize that right especially in

1184.0 --> 1189.36
the nathan oakley chat

1186.08 --> 1191.6
like i approve really

1189.36 --> 1192.9599999999998
disgusting annoying baller comments

1191.6 --> 1195.9189999999999
there

1192.96 --> 1196.24
unless it's like yeah too far if it's

1195.919 --> 1199.2800000000002
like

1196.24 --> 1202.64
pedo [ __ ] or something you know

1199.28 --> 1203.28
so that's how it works unless somebody

1202.64 --> 1205.76
is

1203.28 --> 1207.76
addressing me personally in being a

1205.76 --> 1210.64
total troll [ __ ] in the moment and

1207.76 --> 1212.96
then open his ass that's different

1210.64 --> 1214.4
but yeah 10th man doesn't have a wrench

1212.96 --> 1216.64
in there so

1214.4 --> 1217.8400000000001
you can just do that there too if you

1216.64 --> 1219.6000000000001
like

1217.84 --> 1223.84
you know you can make a whole scene out

1219.6 --> 1223.84
of it if you really wanted to

1226.799 --> 1230.96
yeah but that doesn't matter if he

1229.76 --> 1235.2
ignores it

1230.96 --> 1237.52
because everyone else will see it

1235.2 --> 1238.24
you might be able to turn everybody's

1237.52 --> 1241.52
head

1238.24 --> 1245.2
into focusing in on your

1241.52 --> 1248.559
specific annoyance with him

1245.2 --> 1250.159
if you want to yeah looking me giving

1248.559 --> 1254.6399999999999
advice to the devil here but

1250.159 --> 1257.3600000000001
yeah you know that's the place for it

1254.64 --> 1259.8400000000001
that's why the chat is the way it is

1257.36 --> 1261.6
over there at nathan's

1259.84 --> 1263.84
for people to be able to share their

1261.6 --> 1263.84
pain

1264.4 --> 1268.72
so you have some pain with ant man

1267.12 --> 1277.76
obviously so

1268.72 --> 1281.44
dude do it

1277.76 --> 1283.44
and hey 10th man encourages it so

1281.44 --> 1285.28
until he realizes what that really

1283.44 --> 1289.2
entails but

1285.28 --> 1292.1589999999999
because he very conveniently forgets

1289.2 --> 1292.159
so yeah why not

1296.24 --> 1300.0
all right oh yeah that was funny i i

1298.88 --> 1303.2800000000002
made a note

1300.0 --> 1305.28
made a few notes i was just thinking

1303.28 --> 1305.6
about like the soylent green movie you

1305.28 --> 1307.52
know

1305.6 --> 1308.8799999999999
everybody here knows the soylent green

1307.52 --> 1312.48
movie at least

1308.88 --> 1314.4
i think all the regulars

1312.48 --> 1315.76
definitely know it know everything about

1314.4 --> 1317.76
it

1315.76 --> 1322.1589999999999
what the secret of soylent greenness

1317.76 --> 1322.1589999999999
which is very much spoiled in the intro

1322.64 --> 1328.24
but yeah if you just remember watching

1326.159 --> 1330.64
that movie

1328.24 --> 1332.799
it's really a first person perspective

1330.64 --> 1334.7990000000002
there's no television screens anywhere

1332.799 --> 1337.9189999999999
it's all turned off

1334.799 --> 1341.039
and you get to see

1337.919 --> 1344.159
bits and pieces of the life of this

1341.039 --> 1346.1589999999999
policeman and

1344.159 --> 1348.72
a good friend of his or his dad i don't

1346.159 --> 1351.1200000000001
remember but yeah

1348.72 --> 1351.919
and you get to see everything that they

1351.12 --> 1353.76
get to see

1351.919 --> 1356.0800000000002
and you get to see what how [ __ ] up

1353.76 --> 1357.52
the people

1356.08 --> 1360.6399999999999
and the surroundings have become how

1357.52 --> 1363.6
trashed it is right well

1360.64 --> 1366.0800000000002
i realized something about this it's

1363.6 --> 1370.559
like a secret

1366.08 --> 1372.8799999999999
that is part of the movie

1370.559 --> 1373.76
and i wonder if the original makers of

1372.88 --> 1378.0800000000002
it

1373.76 --> 1381.76
knew that right

1378.08 --> 1387.4399999999998
so think about this

1381.76 --> 1387.44
what if everything that is said

1387.52 --> 1395.679
in the movie what if the lore

1391.84 --> 1398.559
is all a bluff in the movie

1395.679 --> 1400.799
of soylent green not necessarily about

1398.559 --> 1402.8799999999999
yeah recycling people and all that

1400.799 --> 1404.4
right not that part because you get the

1402.88 --> 1406.159
visual evidence right

1404.4 --> 1407.76
that wouldn't make any sense no no

1406.159 --> 1412.4
everything that's said

1407.76 --> 1416.24
like oh the the oceans turn to poison

1412.4 --> 1419.039
there's no more green anywhere

1416.24 --> 1420.08
right remember that and it's all turned

1419.039 --> 1422.08
to [ __ ]

1420.08 --> 1423.279
the entire world has fallen and there's

1422.08 --> 1426.72
only elite an

1423.279 --> 1430.559
elite with a tree in a dome somewhere

1426.72 --> 1434.24
that's what we get to see right well

1430.559 --> 1436.559
consider this what if it was all

1434.24 --> 1438.159
make believe bluff what what if it was

1436.559 --> 1440.32
all pure mind control

1438.159 --> 1441.5200000000002
everything was fenced off remember it

1440.32 --> 1445.36
was all fan stuff

1441.52 --> 1447.679
what if there it's like a mind control

1445.36 --> 1450.279
project it's like a doomsday

1447.679 --> 1451.76
civilization project separated

1450.279 --> 1454.08
compartmentalized

1451.76 --> 1456.1589999999999
from the rest of the world that would

1454.08 --> 1458.8799999999999
not contract

1456.159 --> 1460.72
with it all that time ago what if the

1458.88 --> 1463.279
rest of the world was

1460.72 --> 1464.64
not necessarily filled but still plenty

1463.279 --> 1467.36
around

1464.64 --> 1469.2
we'll say amish people and they were

1467.36 --> 1472.08
just out there in the wilds

1469.2 --> 1472.559
not using anything noteworthy as they do

1472.08 --> 1475.6789999999999
not

1472.559 --> 1477.36
electronics and just being amish

1475.679 --> 1478.88
there's a great likelihood that they're

1477.36 --> 1482.1589999999999
just still around

1478.88 --> 1485.3600000000001
and that it's basically

1482.159 --> 1487.44
being as a demoralization mind control

1485.36 --> 1488.6399999999999
spell being said everything is destroyed

1487.44 --> 1489.3600000000001
there's no more food there's no more

1488.64 --> 1491.919
resources

1489.36 --> 1494.0
we're not sharing any more food with you

1491.919 --> 1496.24
we have to recycle you

1494.0 --> 1498.84
but there's these big fences and all

1496.24 --> 1501.84
these healthy looking soldiers

1498.84 --> 1501.84
everywhere

1508.24 --> 1511.6
have you ever considered that what is

1511.2 --> 1514.799
left

1511.6 --> 1515.76
out and that you are drawn in to the

1514.799 --> 1518.0
perspective

1515.76 --> 1519.76
of these people it you're getting very

1518.0 --> 1523.039
close up to them

1519.76 --> 1526.0
into what it is like what they've heard

1523.039 --> 1527.84
what they've had to settle with and then

1526.0 --> 1531.2
move on and still try to be a strong

1527.84 --> 1531.1999999999998
person you know the main character

1531.44 --> 1535.919
but you don't get told like a pre-story

1534.88 --> 1539.7600000000002
or anything like

1535.919 --> 1542.72
yeah this is a mind control project

1539.76 --> 1544.96
they've all been cornered off and this

1542.72 --> 1548.08
is the story they're getting

1544.96 --> 1550.48
while the rest of the world is still

1548.08 --> 1550.48
going

1553.36 --> 1559.1999999999998
almost like it's a truman show doomsday

1556.64 --> 1559.2
project

1560.88 --> 1565.679
have you ever thought about that silent

1563.36 --> 1565.6789999999999
green

1567.039 --> 1574.799
there is room there it is an option

1571.44 --> 1574.799
that that might be the case

1577.279 --> 1580.64
it's yeah it's almost like i guess it's

1580.08 --> 1583.6
a fan

1580.64 --> 1585.2
fiction interpretation but yeah the

1583.6 --> 1588.32
movie the way it's presented

1585.2 --> 1591.039
leaves the room leaves

1588.32 --> 1592.08
enough room in order to fill it in like

1591.039 --> 1595.44
that

1592.08 --> 1596.96
it is an option within the cosmology

1595.44 --> 1601.039
within

1596.96 --> 1601.039
the reality of that movie

1601.12 --> 1607.279
see within that science fiction

1604.159 --> 1610.0
conception i thought it was

1607.279 --> 1613.2
interesting it was worthy enough to make

1610.0 --> 1614.48
a note of it i threw it out in the chat

1613.2 --> 1617.76
over at big bears but

1614.48 --> 1619.6
i don't didn't hear any people picking

1617.76 --> 1620.799
up on it so i just put it down right

1619.6 --> 1624.48
here

1620.799 --> 1624.48
yeah i think that soylent green

1624.88 --> 1628.0
that the absolute destruction of

1626.96 --> 1630.0
everything

1628.0 --> 1631.679
that is said to be there might be a

1630.0 --> 1641.84
bluff

1631.679 --> 1641.8400000000001
might be mind control

1647.76 --> 1651.84
it's so somehow are we

1652.84 --> 1655.84
what

1656.399 --> 1661.6789999999999
it mirrors covid well that's basically

1659.6 --> 1662.32
where i am drawing the consideration

1661.679 --> 1665.919
from

1662.32 --> 1668.08
if people can be fooled into believing

1665.919 --> 1669.5200000000002
things like that that everything is

1668.08 --> 1673.039
destroyed because it's out of their

1669.52 --> 1676.32
sight they just take it for granted well

1673.039 --> 1677.36
if it's that easy if it's that easy to

1676.32 --> 1680.96
fool people

1677.36 --> 1682.7199999999998
under duress well then you could look at

1680.96 --> 1684.08
that movie from a whole different

1682.72 --> 1687.44
perspective and realize

1684.08 --> 1691.36
maybe that is the future

1687.44 --> 1694.72
of the mask people

1691.36 --> 1695.279
maybe literally but it does not have to

1694.72 --> 1698.3990000000001
be the

1695.279 --> 1701.84
entire world

1698.399 --> 1710.799
it's it leaves that option

1701.84 --> 1712.72
open if you look at the movie carefully

1710.799 --> 1714.559
well the option the author didn't go

1712.72 --> 1717.6000000000001
with

1714.559 --> 1720.799
what do you mean it's left open

1717.6 --> 1721.4399999999998
just because the author as a narrator in

1720.799 --> 1724.32
the book

1721.44 --> 1726.0800000000002
says this and this and this is going on

1724.32 --> 1728.48
yeah you could consider that

1726.08 --> 1730.6399999999999
that is just saying this is what it is

1728.48 --> 1734.0
this is what the reality of my book is

1730.64 --> 1737.2
or you can consider it from

1734.0 --> 1740.399
the perspective of what the characters

1737.2 --> 1745.679
in the book know to be reality

1740.399 --> 1745.6789999999999
you see because that

1747.6 --> 1754.9599999999998
that can be important

1752.559 --> 1757.2
it can highlight things it can show you

1754.96 --> 1761.1200000000001
how thick illusions

1757.2 --> 1764.0
can run and then how the psyche responds

1761.12 --> 1764.6399999999999
and then people could even and i've done

1764.0 --> 1767.919
this

1764.64 --> 1770.96
my grading that's the thing we migrate

1767.919 --> 1772.3990000000001
our psyche per default into the suspense

1770.96 --> 1775.8400000000001
of disbelief

1772.399 --> 1778.799
that it is all literal as narrated as

1775.84 --> 1780.32
said to be the world in there that's our

1778.799 --> 1782.399
default position because we're kind of

1780.32 --> 1787.9189999999999
used to that with movies

1782.399 --> 1787.9189999999999
but consider it my way and then suddenly

1788.399 --> 1791.52
you can look at them as people that

1790.799 --> 1793.9189999999999
believe

1791.52 --> 1796.24
all that and that have made their choice

1793.919 --> 1797.679
this is how we're gonna go with it

1796.24 --> 1799.679
but who knows there might have been

1797.679 --> 1800.5590000000002
people that have managed to escape the

1799.679 --> 1803.679
fencing

1800.559 --> 1806.799
had have gone on into the wilds

1803.679 --> 1808.96
and basically ended up into

1806.799 --> 1810.559
a similar scenario as what happened with

1808.96 --> 1812.88
brave new world

1810.559 --> 1814.32
that there is an outside community in

1812.88 --> 1817.279
campers where people get

1814.32 --> 1819.9189999999999
born and all that remember where it's

1817.279 --> 1823.2
all raw and old

1819.919 --> 1823.5200000000002
the old ways well maybe that could also

1823.2 --> 1827.039
be

1823.52 --> 1832.0
present in that movie it's just not

1827.039 --> 1832.0
focused on it's all a matter of

1834.84 --> 1837.84
considerations

1842.159 --> 1845.919
also like the movie the village yes

1846.32 --> 1850.72
right well i'm not going to be the first

1849.039 --> 1854.64
person that is

1850.72 --> 1857.44
inspired in this fashion i'm just saying

1854.64 --> 1859.2
you can actually apply it to soylent

1857.44 --> 1863.1200000000001
green

1859.2 --> 1866.32
just in your mind the movie doesn't

1863.12 --> 1869.6789999999999
it doesn't tell you to do that

1866.32 --> 1873.279
but when you do it you'll see

1869.679 --> 1876.799
that it works it's pretty amazing

1873.279 --> 1879.36
it's just another way of of reading it

1876.799 --> 1879.9189999999999
or watching the movie movie is a pretty

1879.36 --> 1882.8799999999999
good

1879.919 --> 1893.6000000000001
representation of the book so i've heard

1882.88 --> 1896.7990000000002
i've never read the book

1893.6 --> 1898.7199999999998
isn't that amazing isn't that just

1896.799 --> 1901.6
literally

1898.72 --> 1903.519
a revelation through somewhere you've

1901.6 --> 1905.279
never looked before and it's right there

1903.519 --> 1908.72
it was always there

1905.279 --> 1908.72
therefore the discovery

1912.96 --> 1921.8400000000001
that's the stuff that i love about what

1915.2 --> 1921.8400000000001
i do

1924.88 --> 1932.3200000000002
oh nice hannah koella oh that is awesome

1928.96 --> 1934.0
yeah you know you know what the funny

1932.32 --> 1937.4399999999998
thing is

1934.0 --> 1940.159
if i would get a place to have chickens

1937.44 --> 1942.96
if i had the the room for it i would be

1940.159 --> 1946.3990000000001
able to get chickens for free

1942.96 --> 1947.6000000000001
because yeah every time i do my

1946.399 --> 1950.08
newspaper rounds

1947.6 --> 1951.4399999999998
i get very close to the park and there's

1950.08 --> 1954.559
so many chickens there

1951.44 --> 1955.1200000000001
they're expanding like i've literally

1954.559 --> 1958.559
seen

1955.12 --> 1960.32
little chiclets grow up into full-sized

1958.559 --> 1962.8799999999999
chickens and they've like taken up

1960.32 --> 1964.08
a separate territory away from the

1962.88 --> 1965.7600000000002
entire park

1964.08 --> 1967.12
so they're literally just walking the

1965.76 --> 1969.2
streets there

1967.12 --> 1971.12
and people know it they're used to it so

1969.2 --> 1972.799
cars that drive there always are careful

1971.12 --> 1973.5189999999998
because there's always freaking chickens

1972.799 --> 1977.6
around

1973.519 --> 1982.0
this is like city chickens

1977.6 --> 1985.1999999999998
it's like the [ __ ] they manage they just

1982.0 --> 1986.96
hang around need some water extra water

1985.2 --> 1990.24
in the summer maybe or they get

1986.96 --> 1994.0
very uh and for the rest

1990.24 --> 1997.039
yeah they just eat bugs

1994.0 --> 2000.559
little rocks everywhere

1997.039 --> 2003.679
they pick them from between the tiles

2000.559 --> 2005.6
and they just hang around there so and

2003.679 --> 2007.919
it's a joy to see because they do kind

2005.6 --> 2010.7199999999998
of feel free they're just like

2007.919 --> 2011.519
chickens just chickens and they're

2010.72 --> 2014.48
pretty

2011.519 --> 2014.48
strong looking too

2014.72 --> 2019.6000000000001
they're not getting any gmo crap that's

2016.72 --> 2022.3990000000001
for sure they look very

2019.6 --> 2023.4399999999998
in tune with what it is to be a chicken

2022.399 --> 2025.279
i don't

2023.44 --> 2028.0800000000002
yeah that might sound kind of silly i

2025.279 --> 2033.84
don't know from personal experience

2028.08 --> 2033.84
it's just something you can feel

2035.52 --> 2038.68
[Music]

2040.399 --> 2047.9189999999999
from the balcony what that's

2044.72 --> 2050.639
that's hilarious no but

2047.919 --> 2054.32
there's way too much too much flying

2050.639 --> 2057.04
bird activity here to have chickens

2054.32 --> 2058.639
because yeah and besides there is

2057.04 --> 2061.839
already chickens over there

2058.639 --> 2061.839
and over there

2063.119 --> 2066.079
yeah i'm just saying

2066.159 --> 2069.359
i already kind of have like city

2067.679 --> 2071.359
chickens around

2069.359 --> 2072.96
seems to be a thing and i kind of love

2071.359 --> 2075.5989999999997
it

2072.96 --> 2077.2
also the cats and there are plenty of

2075.599 --> 2080.56
those

2077.2 --> 2083.359
they're not it's not like oh my god all

2080.56 --> 2084.96
the chicken slaughtering that's going on

2083.359 --> 2086.639
with all the cats even though there are

2084.96 --> 2089.76
plenty of cats no

2086.639 --> 2092.879
no the chickens seem to be thriving

2089.76 --> 2094.8
despite the cats

2092.879 --> 2097.92
or maybe these chickens are a little bit

2094.8 --> 2100.1600000000003
too strong and healthy for the cats

2097.92 --> 2101.599
because they're not yeah literally they

2100.16 --> 2105.2799999999997
have an entire park

2101.599 --> 2105.28
park to just walk around over there

2109.599 --> 2116.1600000000003
all right hey hello simon dan

2112.96 --> 2116.56
yes i know i knew you would pick up on

2116.16 --> 2120.72
that

2116.56 --> 2124.4
because if anything you always listen

2120.72 --> 2127.1189999999997
not to content but you always

2124.4 --> 2129.599
keep tabs that's better way to phrase it

2127.119 --> 2132.8
anyway you would pick up on that

2129.599 --> 2135.599
and yeah yeah well

2132.8 --> 2137.52
let's see what you'll what you'll bring

2135.599 --> 2142.88
forth

2137.52 --> 2145.599
as to address how we misunderstood

2142.88 --> 2146.1600000000003
when you said our reference for yeah

2145.599 --> 2148.56
your

2146.16 --> 2150.56
us the flat earthers or nathan's

2148.56 --> 2154.32
reference frames are ruined

2150.56 --> 2156.4
very curious to see what you're going to

2154.32 --> 2159.6800000000003
bring forth as what you originally meant

2156.4 --> 2164.64
with that

2159.68 --> 2164.64
so yeah interesting

2165.839 --> 2169.599
and in the meantime yeah nathan's just

2167.839 --> 2170.72
gonna keep on teabagging you though i'm

2169.599 --> 2173.839
just saying

2170.72 --> 2173.839
you know that by the way

2176.82 --> 2180.119
[Music]

2207.68 --> 2215.839
uh okay

2224.0 --> 2228.24
oakley's fallacy stream i've made a good

2227.68 --> 2232.3199999999997
point

2228.24 --> 2236.8799999999997
that qe did not know how to absorb

2232.32 --> 2240.56
cool so what was that exactly

2236.88 --> 2240.56
yeah i love all the praising

2241.28 --> 2249.52
yeah i know i have very noteworthy

2245.52 --> 2252.72
globe conceptualizing skills

2249.52 --> 2255.04
i know it's noteworthy it's worthy

2252.72 --> 2259.1189999999997
enough for you to address me like that

2255.04 --> 2262.64
in that fashion but could you be more

2259.119 --> 2271.839
in detail about exactly

2262.64 --> 2271.839
what it is you were referring to

2275.2 --> 2285.839
all right okay well hey simon then dude

2279.2 --> 2285.839

2322.56 --> 2330.0789999999997
that's correct not that that's relevant

2326.0 --> 2330.079
to anything prodding like that

2338.839 --> 2341.839
no

2341.92 --> 2347.92
right so but i'm still waiting for that

2343.839 --> 2347.92
answer philosophy of science

2348.32 --> 2351.76
it's really nice to get all these

2350.72 --> 2354.16
compliments

2351.76 --> 2356.1600000000003
but could you be more specific about

2354.16 --> 2359.04
which point

2356.16 --> 2359.68
that was so good that qri qe did not

2359.04 --> 2364.24
know

2359.68 --> 2364.24
how to answer because i really want to

2366.839 --> 2369.839
know

2380.96 --> 2384.16
you don't remember oh you just knew it

2383.359 --> 2388.4

really stallion you too

2451.04 --> 2453.839
oh

2454.4 --> 2460.88
what hasten slow what

2457.839 --> 2466.88
master western tradition

2460.88 --> 2471.839
is that what i'm doing

2466.88 --> 2471.839
i'm honored by your compliment though

2472.24 --> 2476.1189999999997
but i've always thought that i'm

2473.76 --> 2481.8390000000004
actually kind of a

2476.119 --> 2481.839
non-traditionalist at it

2482.8 --> 2486.4
but maybe i'm so non-traditional it's

2485.599 --> 2490.1600000000003
become

2486.4 --> 2490.1600000000003
a tradition or something i don't know

2492.839 --> 2495.839
this

2509.599 --> 2516.88
i what i don't know

2512.72 --> 2520.64
latin and greek uh hasten slowly

2516.88 --> 2522.8
i've just kind of been exposed to it

2520.64 --> 2524.4
through other people so you know it's

2522.8 --> 2528.0
like i don't know it i do

2524.4 --> 2529.28
get it sort of i'm getting the feel for

2528.0 --> 2533.52
it i just

2529.28 --> 2537.76
i don't have yeah

2533.52 --> 2539.52
how do you explain this

2537.76 --> 2541.2000000000003
you don't have to fully understand

2539.52 --> 2542.88
languages to get

2541.2 --> 2544.64
what people are trying to convey with

2542.88 --> 2547.119
them sometimes

2544.64 --> 2547.7599999999998
and you do pick up on just details or

2547.119 --> 2550.319
typical

2547.76 --> 2551.599
details like hey what is so unusual

2550.319 --> 2554.96
about this language

2551.599 --> 2556.6400000000003
well they switch this word and that word

2554.96 --> 2558.64
around in their grammar

2556.64 --> 2561.1189999999997
and that is what makes them so unique

2558.64 --> 2562.64
well i do pick up on that typical type

2561.119 --> 2564.7200000000003
of knowledge

2562.64 --> 2566.8799999999997
so even though i don't know the content

2564.72 --> 2567.839
of the words i pick up that that sort of

2566.88 --> 2571.2000000000003
thing is going

2567.839 --> 2574.319
on underneath the structuring

2571.2 --> 2574.8799999999997
of it often that system does work with

2574.319 --> 2577.2799999999997
me

2574.88 --> 2578.96
so i got yeah and that way just get a

2577.28 --> 2583.44
feel

2578.96 --> 2583.44
for the languages you know what yeah

2590.839 --> 2593.839
anyway

2604.839 --> 2611.2
if

2607.68 --> 2613.2

to the utter detail

2768.24 --> 2771.359
i can't explain where the direction

2770.0 --> 2773.119
comes from it comes from the

2771.359 --> 2774.7999999999997
differential between the

2773.119 --> 2776.56
between the density of the medium and

2774.8 --> 2778.079
the object

2776.56 --> 2779.599
that's where that's where it comes from

2778.079 --> 2782.319
if it's the

2779.599 --> 2783.839
differentials one way goes one direction

2782.319 --> 2785.44
if the differential is the other way it

2783.839 --> 2789.92
goes the other direction

2785.44 --> 2794.0
up and down that's where it comes from

2789.92 --> 2798.079
now why it works the way it does

2794.0 --> 2801.599
i don't know i just know how it works

2798.079 --> 2804.7200000000003
can scientifically prove that cannot

2801.599 --> 2808.8
prove what causes

2804.72 --> 2812.0
it to cause it i don't know why

2808.8 --> 2812.0
it i just know it does

2814.56 --> 2819.2
yeah but it doesn't matter the the

2817.44 --> 2822.4
directions are not

2819.2 --> 2826.72
relative do you get it the directions

2822.4 --> 2829.44
are not relative relative density

2826.72 --> 2831.04
is not about the directions that are

2829.44 --> 2834.64
relative

2831.04 --> 2838.4
it's about the differential

2834.64 --> 2841.68
between object and medium

2838.4 --> 2842.8
that is the relative part that is the

2841.68 --> 2846.0
part that is relative

2842.8 --> 2848.559
not the resulting directions of

2846.0 --> 2852.0
displacement and pressure

2848.559 --> 2855.28
that come from this relation

2852.0 --> 2859.839
between relative relation

2855.28 --> 2859.8390000000004
between the medium and the object

2860.64 --> 2863.68
so yeah

2865.599 --> 2871.839
there's no relative directions

2868.72 --> 2875.839
in relative density that's not what the

2871.839 --> 2887.839
relative word is aiming

2875.839 --> 2887.839
at it's not what it's pointing at

2893.76 --> 2896.88
where's the vector coming from i don't

2896.319 --> 2900.0
know

2896.88 --> 2903.28
i just know it's there can consider it

2900.0 --> 2906.4
natural law there's been nothing to

2903.28 --> 2909.28
disprove that it changes

2906.4 --> 2909.28
the way it works

2909.52 --> 2912.88
so yeah

2915.92 --> 2919.76
it's the way it works i don't know why

2918.24 --> 2921.839
you want to know why why

2919.76 --> 2922.8
waste your entire [ __ ] life trying to

2921.839 --> 2926.5589999999997
figure that out

2922.8 --> 2928.7200000000003
okay go ahead do it

2926.559 --> 2929.76
i don't know why i don't want to waste

2928.72 --> 2932.5589999999997
my entire life

2929.76 --> 2933.3590000000004
trying to figure out why i'll just

2932.559 --> 2936.2400000000002
figure

2933.359 --> 2936.88
out things that can be figured out that

2936.24 --> 2940.0789999999997
are

2936.88 --> 2942.0
a little bit more constructive instead

2940.079 --> 2944.079
instead of trying to wonder why is

2942.0 --> 2946.0
natural law natural law

2944.079 --> 2947.76
why does it have to be that way why

2946.0 --> 2950.4
isn't there no exception

2947.76 --> 2951.6800000000003
why can't we get our freaking ball to

2950.4 --> 2954.4
work

2951.68 --> 2955.359
in an outer space vacuum why won't

2954.4 --> 2958.64
natural law

2955.359 --> 2960.319
adapt to our will no i'm not going to do

2958.64 --> 2963.2799999999997
that

2960.319 --> 2964.96
i'm just going to figure out how things

2963.28 --> 2967.52
work

2964.96 --> 2969.28
figuring out the cause of an effect for

2967.52 --> 2972.8
phenomena

2969.28 --> 2973.3590000000004
then i'll see what i can figure out what

2972.8 --> 2985.8390000000004
that is

2973.359 --> 2985.839
it's plenty to do

2987.119 --> 2991.44
and your problem with that is

2991.68 --> 2997.7599999999998
but nathan uses natural law to try and

2994.96 --> 2997.76
prove things

3002.079 --> 3007.8390000000004
why wouldn't you it's natural law it

3005.2 --> 3010.3999999999996
always works like that that's why it's

3007.839 --> 3011.2799999999997
natural law why wouldn't you use that to

3010.4 --> 3014.96
try and prove

3011.28 --> 3014.96
things nasaim and then

3020.96 --> 3027.839
what you're not allowed to to use the

3023.2 --> 3027.839
laws of nature to make a point

3032.24 --> 3039.2799999999997
it flies no it doesn't

3036.24 --> 3041.52
no it doesn't

3039.28 --> 3042.559
the second law of thermodynamics does

3041.52 --> 3046.079
not fly

3042.559 --> 3048.48
in the face of cold moonlight believers

3046.079 --> 3049.44
the cold moonlight there is cold

3048.48 --> 3052.72
involved

3049.44 --> 3054.559
now what causes the cold exactly

3052.72 --> 3056.24
that is a little bit that might be a

3054.559 --> 3058.3190000000004
little bit more difficult to figure out

3056.24 --> 3061.52
because yeah light shouldn't be able to

3058.319 --> 3063.599
carry cold energy there might be a

3061.52 --> 3066.839
frequency situation

3063.599 --> 3068.1600000000003
going on somehow it's the the way like

3066.839 --> 3071.52
the

3068.16 --> 3074.3999999999996
specific frequency of light that may be

3071.52 --> 3075.359
causing something else other than

3074.4 --> 3077.6800000000003
introducing

3075.359 --> 3078.4
energy that is causing cold because that

3077.68 --> 3082.16
shouldn't

3078.4 --> 3085.359
work in reality that's why i suggested

3082.16 --> 3087.1189999999997
even through an experimental setup

3085.359 --> 3089.52
could be scientifically proven

3087.119 --> 3092.319
potentially

3089.52 --> 3093.599
some yeah the effect to be present there

3092.319 --> 3097.839
that moonlight

3093.599 --> 3101.2000000000003
causes entropy to go faster

3097.839 --> 3105.839
and that at it it causes heat

3101.2 --> 3109.2
to disperse faster where it hits

3105.839 --> 3112.64
that would effectively cause local

3109.2 --> 3114.96
cooling if the heat moves out faster

3112.64 --> 3116.0
than its surroundings where it isn't

3114.96 --> 3119.52
being

3116.0 --> 3124.319
shown upon by the moonlight

3119.52 --> 3127.359
then perhaps the yeah the

3124.319 --> 3128.64
the increased entropy causes a local

3127.359 --> 3130.96
cooling effect

3128.64 --> 3132.319
that's what i suggested that would make

3130.96 --> 3135.44
it more

3132.319 --> 3137.44
in line with yeah with the with

3135.44 --> 3140.8
thermodynamics

3137.44 --> 3144.079
it can be tested i i i was able to

3140.8 --> 3144.8
configure a setup to be able to falsify

3144.079 --> 3148.559
it

3144.8 --> 3149.28
by getting a closed off container with

3148.559 --> 3152.6400000000003
an open

3149.28 --> 3156.3190000000004
roof of

3152.64 --> 3159.92
proper type of material not glass

3156.319 --> 3163.52
uh certain types of plastic that do not

3159.92 --> 3165.52
block out certain types of light

3163.52 --> 3167.04
because glass does that especially

3165.52 --> 3168.8
infrared

3167.04 --> 3171.52
so that you can let all the light

3168.8 --> 3176.2400000000002
through and then

3171.52 --> 3179.2
ensure two different types of setups

3176.24 --> 3181.2799999999997
namely you have ground you have ground

3179.2 --> 3182.24
that the moonlight could hit through the

3181.28 --> 3185.28
roof if it was

3182.24 --> 3187.2799999999997
open and you have the air and you have

3185.28 --> 3189.119
to control the temperatures of both very

3187.28 --> 3193.76
carefully

3189.119 --> 3198.319
two in one setup make

3193.76 --> 3202.0
the air slightly

3198.319 --> 3203.359
what is it colder

3202.0 --> 3205.04
than the ground and just let the

3203.359 --> 3207.359
moonlight

3205.04 --> 3210.16
do its thing and then see if it cools

3207.359 --> 3210.16
off quicker

3210.24 --> 3213.839
than if there wasn't any moonlight

3211.839 --> 3216.0
hitting it in a closed box so that

3213.839 --> 3218.0
cannot escape any the air cannot be able

3216.0 --> 3220.16
to escape it has to be

3218.0 --> 3222.079
uh like a closed system so that only the

3220.16 --> 3222.5589999999997
moonlight through an open roof could hit

3222.079 --> 3224.6400000000003
it

3222.559 --> 3226.48
and then you can check with that

3224.64 --> 3228.0789999999997
scenario with different temperatures

3226.48 --> 3229.52
if there's an entropy increase and then

3228.079 --> 3232.079
you can do the same setup

3229.52 --> 3232.8
where the temperatures of the air within

3232.079 --> 3235.44
the box

3232.8 --> 3236.1600000000003
and the soil on which the moonlight will

3235.44 --> 3238.0
shine

3236.16 --> 3240.96
are exactly the same temperatures and

3238.0 --> 3242.88
then see if there is cold intruder if it

3240.96 --> 3245.92
is colder

3242.88 --> 3248.48
because if it isn't that would mean

3245.92 --> 3250.0
that the increased entropy doesn't make

3248.48 --> 3253.76
any difference because there is

3250.0 --> 3253.76
no temperature to shift

3254.0 --> 3261.44
because it's equal temperature that

3257.52 --> 3263.52
is the setup that could truly figure out

3261.44 --> 3266.0
what is going on with this apparent

3263.52 --> 3268.64
cooling effect of moonlight

3266.0 --> 3268.64
so yeah

3270.8 --> 3277.119
it's it's yeah this can be done

3273.92 --> 3279.28
i'm willing to do that but i'm gonna

3277.119 --> 3282.88
have to have like a yeah a back garden

3279.28 --> 3286.079
or something for that and some

3282.88 --> 3287.28
yeah build a box glass roof all that i'd

3286.079 --> 3288.799
have to figure it out

3287.28 --> 3293.8390000000004
i have to have money for that sort of

3288.799 --> 3293.839
nonsense because it is just a test

3303.04 --> 3308.64
wow okay they're not listening

3306.4 --> 3310.7200000000003
i'm glad that the audience at least can

3308.64 --> 3314.16
listen if they want

3310.72 --> 3315.9199999999996
now i've had several early bird shows

3314.16 --> 3318.5589999999997
now

3315.92 --> 3320.799
a couple of hundreds of episodes back i

3318.559 --> 3323.76
think i started this like last year

3320.799 --> 3326.4
somewhere halfway i have several

3323.76 --> 3329.2000000000003
episodes dedicated to purely

3326.4 --> 3329.2000000000003
this concept

3330.24 --> 3337.2
how this works how you can test

3334.64 --> 3339.359
what the apparent cooling effect of

3337.2 --> 3342.799
moonlight really is

3339.359 --> 3346.48
through empirical experimentation

3342.799 --> 3348.96
careful testing falsifying it

3346.48 --> 3350.319
falsifying what could be considered the

3348.96 --> 3352.96
cause like is it cool

3350.319 --> 3355.04
right well then this would happen then

3352.96 --> 3356.2400000000002
literally cold would be introduced in

3355.04 --> 3358.799
the setup

3356.24 --> 3359.7599999999998
if the soil and the air were exactly the

3358.799 --> 3363.119
same temperature

3359.76 --> 3367.6800000000003
there would be cooling happening

3363.119 --> 3370.4
or it wouldn't happen because

3367.68 --> 3372.24
yeah it's actually another effect it's

3370.4 --> 3372.88
not literally cold energy being

3372.24 --> 3376.0
introduced

3372.88 --> 3377.839
it's entropy being increased

3376.0 --> 3380.0
somehow by the light frequency and if

3377.839 --> 3382.0789999999997
the temperatures in the air

3380.0 --> 3383.44
and the soil is the same then there will

3382.079 --> 3385.6800000000003
be no cold

3383.44 --> 3386.96
so that is how i was able to figure out

3385.68 --> 3388.24
how to yeah

3386.96 --> 3391.359
figure out what's going on with the

3388.24 --> 3394.16
moonlight very proud that i was able to

3391.359 --> 3394.16
conceive this

3394.319 --> 3397.44
so anyway i'm gonna round out the show

3397.119 --> 3399.76
so

3397.44 --> 3400.64
thanks everyone for coming i hope you

3399.76 --> 3402.3190000000004
liked the show

3400.64 --> 3404.4
if you did then please don't forget to

3410.4 --> 3413.359
every day

3411.44 --> 3415.68
please also do support me through the

3413.359 --> 3418.319
paypal patreon the super chat

3415.68 --> 3420.24
membership system join button they'll be

3418.319 --> 3423.2799999999997
much appreciated

3420.24 --> 3426.319
can still use it to support

3423.28 --> 3429.6800000000003
uh right so

3426.319 --> 3432.72
also very curious about if simon dan is

3429.68 --> 3435.68
actually gonna make that video

3432.72 --> 3438.0
and if it will be just filler or if it

3435.68 --> 3442.0
will be actually a response or

3438.0 --> 3444.4
a halfway attempt to try and

3442.0 --> 3446.88
get his way out of this weird thing that

3444.4 --> 3449.839
he said

3446.88 --> 3451.96
those weeks ago anyway i'll be back

3449.839 --> 3453.7599999999998
tomorrow flat earth early bird number

3451.96 --> 3455.2
685

3453.76 --> 3457.3590000000004
and i'm gonna join the flat earth

3455.2 --> 3458.5589999999997
debates which should start up any second

3457.359 --> 3461.119
now

3458.559 --> 3461.119
hashtag

3466.0 --> 3472.72
oh god yeah and until the next what

3470.079 --> 3472.7200000000003
what roger

3473.599 --> 3479.44
what do you do scroll up

3477.2 --> 3479.4399999999996
what

3480.24 --> 3489.839
host admitted what are you saying

3490.24 --> 3495.5989999999997
radiative cooling reason why things are

3492.88 --> 3498.799
cold in direct moon light oh

3495.599 --> 3502.48
well sure

3498.799 --> 3506.88
radiative cooling

3502.48 --> 3509.52
okey dokey so i guess it is a thing then

3506.88 --> 3510.799
so what i'm suggesting then i guess is

3509.52 --> 3514.16
that

3510.799 --> 3514.799
the moonlight might be an influence that

3514.16 --> 3518.0789999999997
causes

3514.799 --> 3518.079
radiative cooling

3518.88 --> 3523.58
right is i guess thanks for that thanks

3521.44 --> 3525.68
simon dan for

3523.58 --> 3527.359
[Music]

3525.68 --> 3528.96
for that detail i don't know yeah why

3527.359 --> 3531.92
not you know if

3528.96 --> 3534.4
if that's what that's called not because

3531.92 --> 3534.4
of the moon

3534.559 --> 3538.4
okay well then i'm just not gonna care

3536.64 --> 3541.2799999999997
because i'm still gonna do my tests

3538.4 --> 3543.119
