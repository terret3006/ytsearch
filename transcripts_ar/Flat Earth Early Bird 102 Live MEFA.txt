[Music]

14.92 --> 38.4
so

17.8 --> 38.400000000000006
[Music]

39.28 --> 43.6
good morning welcome to flat earth early

43.12 --> 48.879
bird

43.6 --> 52.0
numbers 102 i'm your host irwin

48.879 --> 55.599999999999994
and today's another good day

52.0 --> 55.6
it's a little bit warmer than yesterday

56.32 --> 59.359
it's just this weird thing when i woke

59.039 --> 62.800000000000004
up

59.359 --> 66.24000000000001
look outside it was this

62.8 --> 69.75999999999999
massive massive

66.24 --> 72.72
chemtrail like it was probably

69.76 --> 73.36
hanging there for a while but it was

72.72 --> 78.4
wide

73.36 --> 80.159
it's like this giant giant beam column

78.4 --> 82.479
in the middle of the blue sky hanging

80.159 --> 86.08000000000001
there it looked really

82.479 --> 91.2
unnatural totally unnatural and

86.08 --> 91.2
that was just weird anyway now it's

91.36 --> 94.159
just take a look

98.0 --> 102.799
seem to have shifted more towards the

100.88 --> 105.92
west

102.799 --> 109.36000000000001
but yeah that thing that

105.92 --> 112.84
white haze over there that

109.36 --> 115.52
was it there was basically one giant

112.84 --> 118.159
chemtrail

115.52 --> 120.64
that's how it started and then it moved

118.159 --> 120.64
over to

121.04 --> 123.759
that side

126.64 --> 133.84
yeah not a lot of chemtrails just seems

130.16 --> 136.0
mostly be one big one and some other

133.84 --> 138.72
minor ones i don't know

136.0 --> 138.72
what they're doing

141.28 --> 146.319
other than that birds are chirping

143.84 --> 146.31900000000002
outside

146.4 --> 150.72
and yeah everybody can feel it spring is

149.599 --> 154.16
coming

150.72 --> 154.16
people are outside and

155.2 --> 160.23899999999998
so it's it's very noticeable that during

158.239 --> 163.20000000000002
springtime everybody goes outside

160.239 --> 164.879
and then gets in each other's way it's a

163.2 --> 168.56
typical dutch thing i think with

164.879 --> 171.92
bicycles like bicycle lanes

168.56 --> 174.64000000000001
and then everybody insists on biking

171.92 --> 176.55999999999997
right next to one another so that you

174.64 --> 179.67999999999998
can't get past it's just

176.56 --> 181.76
great but yeah you know i

179.68 --> 183.519
i gotta complain about something i'm

181.76 --> 187.76
dutch you know

183.519 --> 187.76
always have to complain about something

189.84 --> 193.599
yeah for a guy like me who really likes

191.84 --> 195.519
to move it on on a bike

193.599 --> 197.28
that's really annoying when people do

195.519 --> 199.519
that constantly

197.28 --> 201.12
like on one single trip taking not even

199.519 --> 203.84
15 minutes like

201.12 --> 206.56
be obstructed by this for at least five

203.84 --> 206.56
six times

208.64 --> 212.0
i don't hate it it's just annoying that

211.2 --> 215.92
they don't

212.0 --> 217.76
really pay attention don't really care

215.92 --> 218.95899999999997
because they're enjoying the springtime

217.76 --> 222.319
and

218.959 --> 223.28
yeah why why care about what other

222.319 --> 227.83999999999997
people do

223.28 --> 227.84
when you can enjoy it

230.64 --> 234.879
but yeah at least it's spring time and

233.2 --> 236.79899999999998
that's good

234.879 --> 238.79899999999998
oh well i don't know if it's even

236.799 --> 241.84
officially springtime yet but it does

238.799 --> 241.84
feel like it

249.84 --> 255.04
so let's see is in chat a lot of

252.84 --> 258.72
activity ajm

255.04 --> 267.919
constance bruns jeffrey bale

258.72 --> 269.28000000000003
only shipper can't see a mackenzie

267.919 --> 274.24
t-raptor

269.28 --> 274.23999999999995
over moko azan tinted to monaco

275.44 --> 280.71999999999997
good to see all of you says karen b

280.8 --> 284.40000000000003
and there's ace the rig

284.88 --> 288.96
yeah yeah as soon as shout outs happens

287.199 --> 289.91900000000004
everybody quickly quickly say something

288.96 --> 293.19899999999996
i'm here to

289.919 --> 294.479
i'm here too forgot oh yeah it's funny

293.199 --> 299.84000000000003
how that works

294.479 --> 299.84
but that's cool unsalted 667.

301.36 --> 304.32
good to see all of you

304.4 --> 311.59999999999997
check it out got to the

309.28 --> 312.479
to the organic supermarket and got

311.6 --> 316.8
myself

312.479 --> 319.84
a class song organic castle

316.8 --> 325.84000000000003
i feel so lucky i'm gonna

319.84 --> 325.84
eat that

330.479 --> 333.59999999999997
oh sean becker

334.639 --> 341.6
dro dromaga oh daniel field thanks for

338.88 --> 341.6
the super chat

342.0 --> 344.56
voynich

345.199 --> 349.6
yeah anyway today for me it's not gonna

347.6 --> 353.68
be a sandwich with

349.6 --> 356.0
strawberry jelly it's got to be a castle

353.68 --> 357.199
and i like it because i rarely even see

356.0 --> 359.68
those anymore

357.199 --> 362.96000000000004
at that at the supermarket i don't know

359.68 --> 364.96
maybe croissants are not as popular

362.96 --> 366.479
although probably during springtime

364.96 --> 369.19899999999996
they're going to be all the rage again

366.479 --> 372.8
because yeah who doesn't want to sit

369.199 --> 375.91900000000004
in the morning sun at a terrace

372.8 --> 378.56
with a coffee or a tea and a car song

375.919 --> 381.84
that's that's a springtime thing i guess

378.56 --> 381.84
not very much a winter thing

386.24 --> 389.68
but yeah i'm gonna enjoy that during the

389.12 --> 393.039
show

389.68 --> 394.96
or maybe after i don't know so yeah did

393.039 --> 399.12
all of you guys see that

394.96 --> 402.56
that crazy crazy long

399.12 --> 404.639
flat earth debate yesterday with bob the

402.56 --> 407.919
science guy

404.639 --> 412.479
my god that was just

407.919 --> 415.75899999999996
incredible especially how long it lasted

412.479 --> 417.84
that was just amazing

415.759 --> 419.91900000000004
uh yeah the first live stream you didn't

417.84 --> 423.35999999999996
get to see it all

419.919 --> 426.24
but nathan then premiered it later that

423.36 --> 428.40000000000003
evening and yeah it was

426.24 --> 430.319
almost three hours long it was just

428.4 --> 433.67999999999995
incredible

430.319 --> 437.199
and that guy that guy

433.68 --> 440.479
i i think he must have been rumpus's

437.199 --> 443.28000000000003
uncle or something because my god

440.479 --> 443.28
never stopped

444.08 --> 448.96
i i was in there up until the last

446.639 --> 448.96000000000004
minute

449.039 --> 453.12
way past six o'clock here usually

451.919 --> 455.919
debates end like

453.12 --> 456.72
way before six o'clock for me amsterdam

455.919 --> 459.75899999999996
time

456.72 --> 462.319
and i got such a headache after that

459.759 --> 462.319
from just

462.639 --> 467.599
ah so i got a few beers after that as a

465.919 --> 470.15999999999997
reward to get over that

467.599 --> 471.919
and had a lot of fun oh yeah i did a

470.16 --> 472.47900000000004
little moon video i haven't done any of

471.919 --> 476.56
those

472.479 --> 479.919
for a time for some time that was good

476.56 --> 482.08
it was pretty impressive full moon

479.919 --> 485.12
although yeah on my webcam there's not

482.08 --> 485.12
really a lot to see

485.199 --> 488.319
if you guys keep on rolling in the super

487.36 --> 491.52000000000004
chat

488.319 --> 493.84000000000003
that may change somewhere during this

491.52 --> 493.84
year

496.72 --> 499.759
yeah logical fallacies all over the

499.199 --> 502.479
place

499.759 --> 504.56
that's right but yeah if you haven't

502.479 --> 508.0
seen that do check it out

504.56 --> 511.68
let's see which one which one

508.0 --> 515.36
was it let me check

511.68 --> 515.36
i'm pretty sure i got it uploaded

518.56 --> 525.92

522.0 --> 535.839
and after show my god

525.92 --> 535.8389999999999
that was really something

537.44 --> 539.9200000000001
let's see

540.959 --> 545.8389999999999
for those who want to check it out that

542.8 --> 545.8389999999999
haven't checked it out

545.92 --> 550.7199999999999
i'll put the link in chat right now

549.12 --> 552.399
most of you here probably have already

550.72 --> 555.6800000000001
seen it but yeah it is

552.399 --> 556.08
definitely worth it if you want to see

555.68 --> 559.12
some

556.08 --> 562.64
true flat earth debate high

559.12 --> 564.48
tension stakes action that that is what

562.64 --> 568.16
you gotta watch

564.48 --> 571.12
it was incredible make sure to get

568.16 --> 571.92
to get a beer or something because you

571.12 --> 574.48
will need it

571.92 --> 576.24
it is so long and it is so intense it

574.48 --> 579.6800000000001
was incredible

576.24 --> 580.08
and nathan my god that guy really built

579.68 --> 583.76
some

580.08 --> 587.6800000000001
serious stamina to stay on that level

583.76 --> 588.0
so long like i wouldn't be surprised if

587.68 --> 591.279
he

588.0 --> 592.24
kind of lost his voice today from being

591.279 --> 595.6
so

592.24 --> 596.16
loud and just for so long it was

595.6 --> 599.12
incredible

596.16 --> 602.399
anyway yeah that was a blast great great

599.12 --> 602.399
flat earth debate action

602.839 --> 605.839
classic

616.839 --> 622.0790000000001
um

618.079 --> 622.079
hey [ __ ] use did you just

622.399 --> 626.24
accidentally t type an a there instead

625.279 --> 632.0
of a

626.24 --> 635.36
u or was that

632.0 --> 635.36
some kind of joke there

640.88 --> 647.92
anyway see a lot of people in chat

644.399 --> 660.8
um don't know every one of those

647.92 --> 664.7199999999999
al atiyah

660.8 --> 664.7199999999999
ah right it was a typo

667.68 --> 673.3599999999999
oh god just what one letter can make a

672.079 --> 677.12
huge difference

673.36 --> 677.12
doesn't it yeah it's amazing

679.2 --> 689.839
hello john smith

692.079 --> 697.8389999999999
yeah yeah lottie says it's amazing how a

695.2 --> 701.36
grocery delivery driver

697.839 --> 705.2790000000001
destroys an actual doctor in science

701.36 --> 707.92
yeah you know what that is it's because

705.279 --> 709.76
that actual doctor in science thinks he

707.92 --> 713.92
is quite something

709.76 --> 717.279
because he was really good at

713.92 --> 720.56
going with the consensus

717.279 --> 724.48
and learning material

720.56 --> 727.92
by heart and then championing it

724.48 --> 730.72
like that actually means something

727.92 --> 731.4399999999999
and he was obviously not really a master

730.72 --> 735.2
at

731.44 --> 735.2
true critical thinking and

735.92 --> 741.5999999999999
yeah actual consciousness so yeah he was

739.44 --> 744.24
a really good priest in that sense he

741.6 --> 745.279
mastered the art of presuppositional

744.24 --> 748.399
reasoning

745.279 --> 750.24
definitely but yet it doesn't really

748.399 --> 752.079
make you a scientist

750.24 --> 754.0
not really although yeah it is

752.079 --> 757.04
culturally and culturally

754.0 --> 758.88
implied that it does it just makes you a

757.04 --> 764.0
really good heliocentric

758.88 --> 764.0
priest and yeah

764.399 --> 771.76
you don't really need a paper

768.56 --> 775.5999999999999
to be good at science

771.76 --> 778.959
you really gotta want to be good at it

775.6 --> 781.6800000000001
and most importantly be truly honest

778.959 --> 782.6389999999999
about everything you learn as you learn

781.68 --> 787.8389999999999
it

782.639 --> 787.839
and find your way through the material

788.959 --> 792.959
so it's really funny that globals like

791.44 --> 796.0
to

792.959 --> 798.2399999999999
put that out there oh my god oh he

796.0 --> 800.639
this guy doesn't have a paper how can

798.24 --> 802.48
this happen how can he outsmart somebody

800.639 --> 806.0
that has all these papers like

802.48 --> 806.88
oh i got paper i got paper oh now i'm

806.0 --> 808.72
better than you

806.88 --> 810.56
i'm more intellectual than you because i

808.72 --> 814.24
got paper paper

810.56 --> 829.8389999999999
paper no not not really

814.24 --> 829.839
you know

840.839 --> 843.839
hmm

844.079 --> 851.519
so if anyone wants to join the panel

847.68 --> 857.8389999999999
i haven't had some in a while

851.519 --> 857.839
that would be really appreciated

862.639 --> 873.539
hold on i've got echo

870.51 --> 873.539
[Music]

882.88 --> 886.249
i'm

883.22 --> 886.249
[Music]

893.36 --> 899.839
getting a feedback loop here

911.12 --> 914.48
stop squeaking the wheel

918.0 --> 926.16
ah finally there you go

921.839 --> 928.48
hey constance how are you doing

926.16 --> 928.48
oh

933.68 --> 939.4399999999999
okay i think you may have accidentally

936.72 --> 942.5600000000001
clicked everything away now

939.44 --> 942.5600000000001
because i'm not hearing you

942.639 --> 948.5600000000001
anyway uh yeah thank you for joining

953.04 --> 957.759
okay we'll we'll find out when she gets

955.519 --> 957.759
back

962.639 --> 969.839
all right let's get some tea over here

982.8 --> 989.4399999999999
anyway i've been getting all these

986.0 --> 993.839
silly ideas uh well not really that

989.44 --> 996.399
that bad it's just i guess

993.839 --> 997.6800000000001
yeah because i i watched behind the

996.399 --> 1001.04
curve

997.68 --> 1004.0
and saw mark sergeant again like

1001.04 --> 1004.0
going through all

1004.639 --> 1010.0
yeah what they do and all the props and

1007.199 --> 1012.399
everything i was just thinking like hmm

1010.0 --> 1013.12
i could do something like that oh yeah

1012.399 --> 1015.36
constance

1013.12 --> 1016.72
left i don't know she's probably even

1015.36 --> 1019.839
restarting or something

1016.72 --> 1019.839
i hope to see her back

1020.56 --> 1028.24
but i was thinking like

1024.079 --> 1030.319
maybe we could like ride onto a big meme

1028.24 --> 1032.319
and trick some people or something like

1030.319 --> 1033.52
i was thinking like what if i had like a

1032.319 --> 1036.48
red cap

1033.52 --> 1036.959
you know a cap just being red in this

1036.48 --> 1041.439
age

1036.959 --> 1043.8390000000002
is almost like yeah that's a big deal

1041.439 --> 1044.799
even if you don't have maga written on

1043.839 --> 1048.079
it

1044.799 --> 1049.36
but maybe we could have like red caps

1048.079 --> 1053.039
with

1049.36 --> 1055.28
earth is flat on it or something oh my

1053.039 --> 1055.28
god

1055.679 --> 1062.48
or things like make

1058.72 --> 1062.48
earth flat again

1064.84 --> 1071.9189999999999
mafa what do you think

1068.72 --> 1074.4
welcome back constance thank you

1071.919 --> 1077.1200000000001
good morning good afternoon good evening

1074.4 --> 1081.1200000000001
someone out there

1077.12 --> 1082.6399999999999
yeah australians australians are

1081.12 --> 1084.8799999999999
in the middle of the night right now i

1082.64 --> 1087.039
think well they're

1084.88 --> 1088.7990000000002
evening being at summer down there they

1087.039 --> 1092.96
have long

1088.799 --> 1095.44
sunny sunsets probably around

1092.96 --> 1097.76
nine o'clock ten o'clock at night nine

1095.44 --> 1097.76
o'clock

1098.0 --> 1102.24
how you been i've been good

1109.12 --> 1113.1999999999998
yeah what do you think about my

1110.88 --> 1117.2
mayfirehead

1113.2 --> 1119.3600000000001
a red cap with mafia on it it's cool

1117.2 --> 1120.4
it's like people will be asking like

1119.36 --> 1123.52
what

1120.4 --> 1128.16
what does that mean

1123.52 --> 1132.799
like it's not a g what does that mean

1128.16 --> 1132.799
make earth flat again right

1133.12 --> 1136.559
but that's the thing is to get a hook

1135.2 --> 1140.24
you know

1136.559 --> 1142.32
um get them to ask questions

1140.24 --> 1144.32
that way you're in the position of being

1142.32 --> 1147.4399999999998
approached and you're not

1144.32 --> 1151.52
um cornering them

1147.44 --> 1154.72
or confronting them sort of like what

1151.52 --> 1157.039
um oh i got it i got it like you have a

1154.72 --> 1160.0
rat cap with mafa on it

1157.039 --> 1162.24
and then on the inside you can have the

1160.0 --> 1164.799
flat earth map

1162.24 --> 1165.52
to show him it's like yeah make earth

1164.799 --> 1169.76
flat again

1165.52 --> 1171.36
look that would be great that's it

1169.76 --> 1173.44
let me show you something i'm

1171.36 --> 1176.9599999999998
copywriting this okay

1173.44 --> 1181.76
yeah yeah it's our wind's mafa hat

1176.96 --> 1181.76
well hey good idea i want to do it

1183.679 --> 1188.24
that's that sounds terrific absolutely

1188.559 --> 1192.8799999999999
yeah if i'd wear one of those that like

1190.96 --> 1195.52
stand out like

1192.88 --> 1197.2
like nothing out there that's crazy but

1195.52 --> 1199.039
it would make me quite uncomfortable

1197.2 --> 1200.24
because i'm like all pure black and then

1199.039 --> 1203.44
having this red cap

1200.24 --> 1204.159
on that's just so weird standing out

1203.44 --> 1207.52
like a sore

1204.159 --> 1212.48
thumb yeah literally

1207.52 --> 1215.76
a bit a bit stark

1212.48 --> 1218.159
quite well it would be funny maybe

1215.76 --> 1220.24
maybe i would do i would wear something

1218.159 --> 1223.0390000000002
like that maybe to a

1220.24 --> 1224.88
to a yellow vest rally or something

1223.039 --> 1227.679
having a yellow vest on

1224.88 --> 1229.0390000000002
to kind of dampen down the contrast a

1227.679 --> 1234.3200000000002
bit and having a red

1229.039 --> 1239.28
cap mafa oh

1234.32 --> 1242.3999999999999
so um how are the birdies outside

1239.28 --> 1243.12
seem to be doing great i'm hearing a lot

1242.4 --> 1246.5590000000002
of

1243.12 --> 1249.6789999999999
smaller bird activity so they seem to be

1246.559 --> 1252.72
feeling the spring coming back yeah

1249.679 --> 1254.96
frolicking around and having fun

1252.72 --> 1256.4
they're actually mating and everything

1254.96 --> 1259.44
here too they're

1256.4 --> 1262.159
very noisy right and

1259.44 --> 1262.72
something that i've seen is a lot of

1262.159 --> 1265.7600000000002
nests

1262.72 --> 1268.24
bigger nests being built in tree tops

1265.76 --> 1269.36
all of a sudden yeah that's really funny

1268.24 --> 1272.72
it's there's none

1269.36 --> 1275.039
right here directly or like way

1272.72 --> 1276.0
a bit down the road is like something

1275.039 --> 1278.32
these nests

1276.0 --> 1279.039
just seem to have appeared here and

1278.32 --> 1282.72
there

1279.039 --> 1285.039
so it's a good sign the birds are still

1282.72 --> 1285.039
at it

1286.24 --> 1294.0
so um a long time ago

1290.48 --> 1296.799
this gentleman flat earther in chile

1294.0 --> 1298.24
um he was aware that everyone was

1296.799 --> 1299.679
worried about the calendar

1298.24 --> 1302.84
because of all the changes that have

1299.679 --> 1306.88
been made over the centuries and

1302.84 --> 1310.0
millennia and he came up with a way

1306.88 --> 1311.1200000000001
to determine what the day of the week

1310.0 --> 1314.4
was

1311.12 --> 1316.0
and what uh month we were in when the

1314.4 --> 1319.1200000000001
new year would happen

1316.0 --> 1321.84
so the old enochian uh calendar

1319.12 --> 1323.12
and the you know where the year starts

1321.84 --> 1326.1589999999999
in the spring

1323.12 --> 1329.52
with the new moon right

1326.159 --> 1332.5590000000002
and so he devised uh he had a board

1329.52 --> 1333.28
and he he would put nails nail marks

1332.559 --> 1336.799
everywhere

1333.28 --> 1340.48
and he'd measure the shadow every

1336.799 --> 1343.76
afternoon and he'd show the progression

1340.48 --> 1347.2
and then he came upon the the equinox

1343.76 --> 1350.4
and everyone else was saying two weeks

1347.2 --> 1351.8400000000001
too late years we're having the equinox

1350.4 --> 1354.64
they were announcing it

1351.84 --> 1357.039
but what the sun was doing wasn't what

1354.64 --> 1359.8400000000001
they were saying it should be doing

1357.039 --> 1362.0
so he figured out we were off by two

1359.84 --> 1365.039
weeks

1362.0 --> 1368.0
to to spring to all the seasons we the

1365.039 --> 1370.8799999999999
calendar is off by two weeks

1368.0 --> 1373.039
and we arrived at uh when does the

1370.88 --> 1374.64
actual new year begin

1373.039 --> 1377.039
meaning the one that starts in spring

1374.64 --> 1381.2
not the roman one that starts

1377.039 --> 1381.2
january 1st so

1381.52 --> 1385.44
that removed a lot of

1386.0 --> 1389.84
squabbling because he showed it this is

1389.28 --> 1393.28
how you

1389.84 --> 1397.9189999999999
figure it out and everyone that

1393.28 --> 1399.6
um understands what he was doing

1397.919 --> 1401.6000000000001
those who want to keep the sabbath

1399.6 --> 1404.799
there's no more argument now we know

1401.6 --> 1406.08
we can keep the sabbath it's okay the

1404.799 --> 1409.76
days are correct

1406.08 --> 1414.08
but we're off by two weeks of the roman

1409.76 --> 1417.6
whatever two weeks two weeks two

1414.08 --> 1420.6399999999999
weeks two weeks

1417.6 --> 1422.559
sorry maybe don't get it you know what

1420.64 --> 1425.6000000000001
i'm talking about

1422.559 --> 1428.3999999999999
it's it's the lady the fat lady

1425.6 --> 1428.3999999999999
mask from

1429.2 --> 1433.679
that arnold schwarzenegger movie it was

1431.039 --> 1437.2
really good on mars

1433.679 --> 1440.48
oh yeah two weeks

1437.2 --> 1443.679
how long are you staying two two

1440.48 --> 1447.039
weeks two weeks

1443.679 --> 1448.72
yeah so it's just

1447.039 --> 1451.2
that kind of thing pops into my head

1448.72 --> 1453.76
sometimes total recall that's it

1451.2 --> 1454.96
right the original one oh yes yes total

1453.76 --> 1456.72
recall

1454.96 --> 1458.159
that's funny how it's called total

1456.72 --> 1460.799
recall recalls kind of

1458.159 --> 1462.72
yeah i kept wanting to call it uh mars

1460.799 --> 1465.52
or something but he goes

1462.72 --> 1467.76
supposedly goes to mars but the movie is

1465.52 --> 1470.799
total recall

1467.76 --> 1471.679
yeah that's it's a special movie in many

1470.799 --> 1474.96
senses

1471.679 --> 1478.88
yes i love it it's a big classic

1474.96 --> 1482.08
and i still love it oh yeah got lots of

1478.88 --> 1484.159
hidden things in it and little easter

1482.08 --> 1487.36
eggs and

1484.159 --> 1489.8400000000001
um thought surprises i guess i like to

1487.36 --> 1489.84
call them

1491.039 --> 1497.279
yeah what about like

1494.159 --> 1500.88
extorting people with air paying

1497.279 --> 1502.4
for doesn't that sound didn't it sound

1500.88 --> 1505.0390000000002
extreme back then

1502.4 --> 1506.4
and now we're actually talking about it

1505.039 --> 1510.8799999999999
uh-huh

1506.4 --> 1510.88
carbon x oh my god

1512.0 --> 1515.84
what are the odds

1516.08 --> 1520.0
well a hundred percent i'd say

1520.32 --> 1523.4399999999998
they put it out there they're gonna try

1522.32 --> 1526.3999999999999
it out

1523.44 --> 1528.0800000000002
so i'm still waiting for the the

1526.4 --> 1530.24
terminators to arrive

1528.08 --> 1531.4399999999998
and they're working at it it's already

1530.24 --> 1534.88
happening

1531.44 --> 1535.52
in arabia they're already applying these

1534.88 --> 1537.6000000000001
things

1535.52 --> 1538.799
and i'm waiting them to basically break

1537.6 --> 1542.24
out

1538.799 --> 1545.279
get hacked by a military infiltration

1542.24 --> 1549.2
force and just starting to

1545.279 --> 1551.679
yeah just

1549.2 --> 1554.72
break up the place i know it's gonna

1551.679 --> 1557.3600000000001
happen i've seen it happen

1554.72 --> 1558.0
i've got friends over there i should ask

1557.36 --> 1561.4399999999998
them

1558.0 --> 1561.44
what they can find out for me

1562.08 --> 1566.0
in i'm in in saudi arabia

1566.559 --> 1573.12
well there's really nothing to find out

1569.76 --> 1574.08
really the problem is is how these

1573.12 --> 1577.039
things are built

1574.08 --> 1578.559
what type of technology is used in them

1577.039 --> 1581.919
who made it

1578.559 --> 1582.96
and thus who has access to it because

1581.919 --> 1586.48
there is

1582.96 --> 1588.48
hackability to almost every

1586.48 --> 1590.159
modern technology it really depends on

1588.48 --> 1592.88
what factories

1590.159 --> 1595.3600000000001
in what countries built them they all

1592.88 --> 1598.88
have back doors and you can't

1595.36 --> 1601.76
you can't block those out it's really a

1598.88 --> 1604.72
terrible way to make technology

1601.76 --> 1605.84
like if you if that really came out then

1604.72 --> 1609.1200000000001
these factories

1605.84 --> 1611.76
should be closed even though it's like a

1609.12 --> 1613.4399999999998
billion dollar project should be closed

1611.76 --> 1617.2
the people the management

1613.44 --> 1619.6000000000001
arrested for high treason and conspiracy

1617.2 --> 1622.88
against humanity basically

1619.6 --> 1624.8799999999999
for potentially instigating war whatever

1622.88 --> 1627.5200000000002
you could think of and

1624.88 --> 1629.7600000000002
have it redone from scratch no more back

1627.52 --> 1633.44
doors

1629.76 --> 1635.84
never magnifying glass on it build it

1633.44 --> 1637.2
without back doors it would have

1635.84 --> 1640.32
supervision

1637.2 --> 1642.88
privately done and it would have to be

1640.32 --> 1644.32
again the government gets their fingers

1642.88 --> 1647.3600000000001
in it

1644.32 --> 1650.96
the military or the cia

1647.36 --> 1654.0
they insist that there has to be access

1650.96 --> 1657.52
so vulnerability is

1654.0 --> 1658.159
an imposition right well it's those

1657.52 --> 1661.6
people

1658.159 --> 1663.3600000000001
that demand that that should be the ones

1661.6 --> 1666.399
arrested

1663.36 --> 1669.4399999999998
yes they're the ones doing it

1666.399 --> 1671.52
the controllers need to be controlled

1669.44 --> 1673.919
in this case it is more specifically the

1671.52 --> 1675.84
military industrial complexes

1673.919 --> 1677.1200000000001
it's not just one you have the american

1675.84 --> 1680.559
one but there's so

1677.12 --> 1684.4799999999998
many and yeah

1680.559 --> 1684.48
it shouldn't be like that anyway

1687.44 --> 1694.159
so what else is new

1691.279 --> 1695.2
your your intro i love it good job karen

1694.159 --> 1698.24
b

1695.2 --> 1701.52
yeah thanks i i agree and chris barry

1698.24 --> 1702.08
yeah he made that song he made it from

1701.52 --> 1704.1589999999999
scratch

1702.08 --> 1705.9189999999999
i love it he was first bit fooling

1704.159 --> 1707.6000000000001
around trying something out and i was

1705.919 --> 1711.44
like

1707.6 --> 1711.84
no i want it perfect and it gave him

1711.44 --> 1713.8400000000001
like

1711.84 --> 1715.12
this is how it has to feel this is

1713.84 --> 1716.9599999999998
what's going to be

1715.12 --> 1719.12
like the birds on the background and he

1716.96 --> 1720.559
just it came out of him he made it it

1719.12 --> 1723.9189999999999
was perfect i know this

1720.559 --> 1725.84
is perfect and yeah it worked out great

1723.919 --> 1731.1200000000001
i love it too i'm so glad

1725.84 --> 1731.12
yeah it's your it's your mark

1732.0 --> 1738.32
so yeah so happy

1735.12 --> 1740.6399999999999
happy 102nd now

1738.32 --> 1740.6399999999999
right

1741.679 --> 1746.24
yes 102 awesome

1746.64 --> 1751.5200000000002
i don't think i'd be able to do that i

1748.559 --> 1755.2
can't as much as i talk

1751.52 --> 1759.12
a lot of my talk is is uh

1755.2 --> 1761.6000000000001
you know in the corner quiet it isn't

1759.12 --> 1762.32
it you know coffee shop it's not all day

1761.6 --> 1765.1999999999998
long

1762.32 --> 1768.08
right well you save it up you save it up

1765.2 --> 1771.8400000000001
yes but that's what i did too

1768.08 --> 1775.12
and now i've learned to basically

1771.84 --> 1777.6
increase the the total

1775.12 --> 1778.399
intensity of what i can put out so i can

1777.6 --> 1782.24
then

1778.399 --> 1784.399
die down a bit not be super extreme

1782.24 --> 1786.88
in a concentrated period and then spread

1784.399 --> 1789.279
it more out and that way i can manage to

1786.88 --> 1791.7600000000002
have a show every day and still

1789.279 --> 1795.12
yeah not just fall asleep behind the

1791.76 --> 1797.44
camera at times

1795.12 --> 1798.4799999999998
because if you want to be super intense

1797.44 --> 1800.48
all the time

1798.48 --> 1803.84
yeah if you're gonna do a daily show

1800.48 --> 1808.0
yeah you are eventually just gonna drain

1803.84 --> 1810.559
right well that's why it's so cool

1808.0 --> 1812.799
about you because you keep yourself

1810.559 --> 1815.52
informed on so many topics and you

1812.799 --> 1817.76
you've got your interests and then you

1815.52 --> 1821.36
like to hear other people too

1817.76 --> 1825.36
so it makes it a natural thing and

1821.36 --> 1828.399
right um it's good it's very good

1825.36 --> 1830.799
so and it's it's uh different from

1828.399 --> 1832.08
the debates and that it's more of a

1830.799 --> 1834.559
discussion

1832.08 --> 1836.8799999999999
yeah and you know unless the morning

1834.559 --> 1836.8799999999999
breakfast

1840.159 --> 1846.7990000000002
that's just that's psychological warfare

1843.6 --> 1850.9599999999998
big time big big time

1846.799 --> 1854.0
yeah that's not something i could do

1850.96 --> 1854.64
like i have serious respect like some

1854.0 --> 1857.919
people are like

1854.64 --> 1862.72
how dare you nathan is evil

1857.919 --> 1866.0
he's so mean and weird he's he's openly

1862.72 --> 1866.3990000000001
two-faced like uh do as i say not as i

1866.0 --> 1868.96
do

1866.399 --> 1870.9599999999998
and just like yeah but he's honest about

1868.96 --> 1874.48
it and he actually does it

1870.96 --> 1877.3600000000001
every day with that intensity

1874.48 --> 1877.799
it's oh my god like i couldn't do that

1877.36 --> 1880.559
it's

1877.799 --> 1881.12
disingenuous of them to talk that way

1880.559 --> 1882.8799999999999
because

1881.12 --> 1885.6
when a flat earther goes on their

1882.88 --> 1888.96
channels what do we get

1885.6 --> 1892.7199999999998
pure [ __ ] pure exactly so

1888.96 --> 1894.559
again yeah them with the gas lighting

1892.72 --> 1898.24
you know they're the problem

1894.559 --> 1900.0
meanwhile they're doing it

1898.24 --> 1901.679
right and then they get upset when

1900.0 --> 1904.96
someone else does it back to them

1901.679 --> 1907.8400000000001
so it's like okay bully

1904.96 --> 1908.159
we don't even really do it back to them

1907.84 --> 1911.76
no

1908.159 --> 1913.8400000000001
we do it our own we really ask questions

1911.76 --> 1915.679
and then demand the answer and then they

1913.84 --> 1919.12
don't give the answer

1915.679 --> 1921.039
if we were on their channels

1919.12 --> 1922.7199999999998
they don't even really ask questions

1921.039 --> 1925.2
they just [ __ ] over you

1922.72 --> 1926.64
don't give you a question to answer

1925.2 --> 1931.679
that's their strategy

1926.64 --> 1935.6000000000001
mostly they don't ask questions

1931.679 --> 1936.3990000000001
yeah rarely that's the difference a big

1935.6 --> 1939.6
difference but

1936.399 --> 1941.5189999999998
yeah i i think that nathan now does

1939.6 --> 1943.519
i think no he's not doing flat earth

1941.519 --> 1945.6
debates in the weekends anymore

1943.519 --> 1946.559
i think in retrospect that's actually a

1945.6 --> 1950.32
good thing

1946.559 --> 1950.8799999999999
it is yeah seriously that show yesterday

1950.32 --> 1953.76
that's so

1950.88 --> 1954.88
intense you can't do that without having

1953.76 --> 1958.08
at least two days

1954.88 --> 1958.3990000000001
break a week otherwise you just melt

1958.08 --> 1963.1999999999998
that

1958.399 --> 1963.1999999999998
like he has a family as well oh

1965.039 --> 1971.519
and the family would be going you know

1968.32 --> 1974.6399999999999
can you like give us some time now so

1971.519 --> 1976.72
yeah and and i even it's so odd

1974.64 --> 1979.919
maybe it's a little bit like projection

1976.72 --> 1982.159
but sometimes i feel like eleanor

1979.919 --> 1983.8400000000001
is almost like worried about her dad

1982.159 --> 1986.0
that her dad's like

1983.84 --> 1987.039
going to get a burnout so she's like oh

1986.0 --> 1990.64
yeah

1987.039 --> 1993.6
i'm here it's happy it's okay dad

1990.64 --> 1995.279
don't be so stressed out yeah i wonder

1993.6 --> 1997.6
about that

1995.279 --> 1998.37
she's very smart better imagine her

1997.6 --> 2000.1589999999999
grown up

1998.37 --> 2002.4799999999998
[Laughter]

2000.159 --> 2004.0
it's gonna be awesome and having

2002.48 --> 2008.3990000000001
flashbacks what was that

2004.0 --> 2010.08
all about i'm really curious like who

2008.399 --> 2012.799
she's going to be i think

2010.08 --> 2013.6789999999999
she's going to be super bright i know

2012.799 --> 2018.399
she's going to be

2013.679 --> 2020.96
very interesting for sure oh my gosh

2018.399 --> 2022.7199999999998
yep and it's so good because nathan is

2020.96 --> 2026.24
so aware

2022.72 --> 2029.1200000000001
of all the [ __ ] on the vaccines the food

2026.24 --> 2031.2
and he's taking really good care of her

2029.12 --> 2032.4799999999998
so you know she's not gonna turn out to

2031.2 --> 2035.8400000000001
be some

2032.48 --> 2039.279
autistic kid or something not at all and

2035.84 --> 2042.399
we're looking forward to it to see her

2039.279 --> 2044.0
it's refreshing yep

2042.399 --> 2046.32
and now he's getting a second daughter

2044.0 --> 2049.119
as well another one

2046.32 --> 2050.399
yep oh they'll they're gonna be great

2049.119 --> 2052.8790000000004
they're just gonna be fine

2050.399 --> 2053.7599999999998
oh yeah you just wait in five years

2052.879 --> 2056.3199999999997
you're gonna be

2053.76 --> 2057.599
hearing them yelling back and forth

2056.32 --> 2059.84
talking over toys

2057.599 --> 2064.4590000000003
yeah it was mine

2059.84 --> 2064.4590000000003
[Music]

2065.52 --> 2070.079
oh that was that was the best uh social

2068.399 --> 2073.52
learning experience that was

2070.079 --> 2075.04
was at home before we even got shuffled

2073.52 --> 2077.44
off to school or whatever

2075.04 --> 2078.24
um you know the social interaction

2077.44 --> 2081.679
learning

2078.24 --> 2085.839
to share learning not to bite learning

2081.679 --> 2088.8
not to hurt the other person and how to

2085.839 --> 2090.56
you know how to love that younger one um

2088.8 --> 2092.3990000000003
and and understand that the fact that

2090.56 --> 2093.119
mom and dad are paying attention to them

2092.399 --> 2094.7999999999997
isn't

2093.119 --> 2096.639
isn't that they love you any less it's

2094.8 --> 2099.8390000000004
just that that child needs

2096.639 --> 2102.6400000000003
uh more tender care and so

2099.839 --> 2103.92
let's see i'm the fourth of six i got i

2102.64 --> 2106.8799999999997
got babied

2103.92 --> 2107.44
for nine months and then my mother got

2106.88 --> 2111.76
pregnant

2107.44 --> 2114.079
with my next brother and so i was off

2111.76 --> 2116.0
off the nursing they wanted they wanted

2114.079 --> 2118.079
me to go to the bottle and i'm like i

2116.0 --> 2120.56
don't like the bottle

2118.079 --> 2122.88
so i went to sucking my thumb and that

2120.56 --> 2126.24
was my consolation

2122.88 --> 2130.2400000000002
um it was it was just

2126.24 --> 2134.0
you adapt you do something

2130.24 --> 2138.4799999999996
and children are amazingly

2134.0 --> 2141.52
resilient up to a point so

2138.48 --> 2142.4
you know if you're gonna it's gonna be a

2141.52 --> 2144.56
blessing for

2142.4 --> 2145.599
for eleanor to have a younger sister

2144.56 --> 2148.32
indeed but

2145.599 --> 2149.599
also going to be oh by the way [ __ ] jews

2148.32 --> 2153.599
thank you for the super chat

2149.599 --> 2153.599
thank you shout out to ajm

2153.68 --> 2161.04
hey aj right but it's also

2157.04 --> 2162.8
yeah the big thing is and yeah

2161.04 --> 2164.88
i don't need to tell nathan anything he

2162.8 --> 2166.88
knows he knows everything he needs to

2164.88 --> 2169.52
know probably or he'll

2166.88 --> 2170.48
ask to somebody you know he'll figure

2169.52 --> 2173.52
stuff out

2170.48 --> 2175.28
yeah but yeah big thing is for like an

2173.52 --> 2179.599
older sibling

2175.28 --> 2182.0
to really know like yeah that was you

2179.599 --> 2183.28
so everything you went through with your

2182.0 --> 2185.04
mind and how you

2183.28 --> 2187.76
thought about things yeah your little

2185.04 --> 2189.7599999999998
brother sister is going through that too

2187.76 --> 2191.119
and once you get them to really realize

2189.76 --> 2195.3590000000004
that then they can

2191.119 --> 2197.839
find that bigger brother or sister

2195.359 --> 2200.24
protection mode like the sub parent mode

2197.839 --> 2200.88
and that's really valuable because if

2200.24 --> 2202.56
they don't

2200.88 --> 2204.0
then they'll just see them as

2202.56 --> 2206.4
competition

2204.0 --> 2208.48
and get a bit sociopathic against and

2206.4 --> 2211.44
that's not good at all

2208.48 --> 2212.079
but that's that's my situation with my

2211.44 --> 2214.64
son

2212.079 --> 2217.28
being the sociopath and my daughter

2214.64 --> 2220.48
being the amazing

2217.28 --> 2224.32
um balanced and mature

2220.48 --> 2227.599
child so uh he's he's been well

2224.32 --> 2229.52
loved he when he really gets honest

2227.599 --> 2232.88
about it he's been well loved

2229.52 --> 2235.92
but he has this this

2232.88 --> 2238.96
inability or failure to

2235.92 --> 2240.56
um to receive it it's like it's like

2238.96 --> 2241.76
someone who's out in the sunshine but

2240.56 --> 2242.7999999999997
they're all they've always got the

2241.76 --> 2245.8390000000004
umbrella on

2242.8 --> 2249.6800000000003
okay they can't get the sunshine yeah

2245.839 --> 2249.68
they're shut it's sad

2251.28 --> 2254.96
yeah no i was fortunate enough like i

2253.76 --> 2257.0400000000004
had a bigger brother

2254.96 --> 2259.04
seven years older so it's significantly

2257.04 --> 2259.92
old it's half broader even so a bit

2259.04 --> 2262.24
complex

2259.92 --> 2263.44
angle at that because it was from a

2262.24 --> 2267.1189999999997
different father

2263.44 --> 2270.4
so yeah that's that was tough

2267.119 --> 2272.96
for him basically not being around his

2270.4 --> 2275.599
own dad anymore and now having to

2272.96 --> 2277.359
accept my dad which is very different

2275.599 --> 2280.6400000000003
very different every person even

2277.359 --> 2283.04
the way they look yeah but

2280.64 --> 2285.04
yeah my brother he took that

2283.04 --> 2286.56
responsibility and he took it really

2285.04 --> 2288.4
serious

2286.56 --> 2290.56
to be my big brother to be very

2288.4 --> 2292.079
protective to be even my teacher and

2290.56 --> 2296.24
even a bit my dad

2292.079 --> 2298.96
because my dad was very i don't know

2296.24 --> 2301.4399999999996
a kind of like a hippie star trying to

2298.96 --> 2302.88
find himself the guitar player guitar

2301.44 --> 2306.48
teacher

2302.88 --> 2308.1600000000003
wow finding his own thing and like

2306.48 --> 2310.16
the carving wood type it's like a

2308.16 --> 2313.1189999999997
classic hippie in a way

2310.16 --> 2315.1189999999997
and he didn't really really know how to

2313.119 --> 2318.56
take on that father role

2315.119 --> 2321.6800000000003
also because yeah his his dad

2318.56 --> 2324.7999999999997
was kind of an aggressive

2321.68 --> 2325.2799999999997
abusive guy not terribly terribly but

2324.8 --> 2328.2400000000002
still

2325.28 --> 2329.0400000000004
just yeah i never had a real dad role

2328.24 --> 2331.2
model so

2329.04 --> 2332.96
i i don't blame him in retrospect and we

2331.2 --> 2334.8799999999997
get along really good now

2332.96 --> 2336.4
oh thank you by the way only shipper can

2334.88 --> 2339.92
see for the 10

2336.4 --> 2342.96
new zealand dollar super chat donation

2339.92 --> 2347.04
for my camera keep the safe yep

2342.96 --> 2349.839
i will i'll get there like that

2347.04 --> 2351.04
so but yeah i think yeah my brother was

2349.839 --> 2354.4
doing a very good job

2351.04 --> 2357.7599999999998
but at the same time i

2354.4 --> 2360.32
demanded so much attention

2357.76 --> 2361.0400000000004
and more than he could muster at times

2360.32 --> 2365.04
and like

2361.04 --> 2366.72
he was very frustrated as a teenager

2365.04 --> 2368.4
because he'd like had this little

2366.72 --> 2369.4399999999996
brother he basically who basically

2368.4 --> 2372.56
demanded he

2369.44 --> 2374.96
take care of him and

2372.56 --> 2375.7599999999998
he was like but i want to do teenage

2374.96 --> 2378.88
stuff

2375.76 --> 2382.4
yeah and i was like no

2378.88 --> 2385.92
but i wouldn't i want to talk about

2382.4 --> 2387.119
science and electronics and do computer

2385.92 --> 2390.0
stuff i need your help

2387.119 --> 2391.6800000000003
how do you program this and yeah he was

2390.0 --> 2394.16
into programming a lot

2391.68 --> 2395.52
in the early days and i i like tagged

2394.16 --> 2397.68
along constantly

2395.52 --> 2400.0
and he got sick of it he eventually even

2397.68 --> 2403.1189999999997
moved out of the house

2400.0 --> 2405.2
just to get away from that

2403.119 --> 2406.2400000000002
and i really missed him in that time but

2405.2 --> 2408.96
yeah

2406.24 --> 2411.839
you know everybody needs some time for

2408.96 --> 2411.839
themselves

2411.92 --> 2416.079
yeah and now he has his own family with

2414.72 --> 2419.2
two kids

2416.079 --> 2420.96
they should be teens

2419.2 --> 2424.48
that's a really weird realization last

2420.96 --> 2427.599
time i saw them they were like

2424.48 --> 2430.96
four and six or something and that's

2427.599 --> 2433.3590000000004
years ago that's like six years ago

2430.96 --> 2434.4
that you stay in touch you do you get to

2433.359 --> 2438.88
visit

2434.4 --> 2442.4
nope nope nope i don't even get

2438.88 --> 2443.359
a reply when i text message happy new

2442.4 --> 2447.44
year

2443.359 --> 2450.24
so although i did get a reply like hey

2447.44 --> 2452.079
the server is not working but that's

2450.24 --> 2454.56
probably a professional thing that he's

2452.079 --> 2458.2400000000002
just obligated to respond to it

2454.56 --> 2461.599
automatically no matter who it is but no

2458.24 --> 2464.72
it's it's okay you know

2461.599 --> 2467.44
we've grown apart weird [ __ ] as i

2464.72 --> 2469.9199999999996
hinted at some time ago happened was

2467.44 --> 2472.8
that a cat

2469.92 --> 2472.8
no i just cough

2474.16 --> 2481.839
what are you drinking water

2478.839 --> 2486.72
oh um

2481.839 --> 2486.72
it just went dry all of a sudden um

2488.4 --> 2494.7200000000003
but what else what else

2492.48 --> 2496.96
i haven't been i haven't even had time

2494.72 --> 2500.72
to check on the news and stuff

2496.96 --> 2503.52
it's just which news seems to be same

2500.72 --> 2503.52
old same old

2506.48 --> 2512.48
news around the world and

2509.599 --> 2513.119
it's moving it's it's still the same

2512.48 --> 2516.72
game

2513.119 --> 2517.04
the same game of speeches that speed it

2516.72 --> 2520.24
up

2517.04 --> 2520.72
makes narrative wise a lot less less

2520.24 --> 2524.0
sense

2520.72 --> 2526.8799999999997
and media is just instant adapting

2524.0 --> 2528.56
trying to bypass it like oh i know it

2526.88 --> 2530.2400000000002
doesn't make any sense but go with this

2528.56 --> 2531.2
because that's the narrative we've been

2530.24 --> 2534.72
presented

2531.2 --> 2538.0789999999997
yes and everybody is just like okay

2534.72 --> 2541.04
i hope world war four

2538.079 --> 2542.8
isn't going to happen tomorrow some

2541.04 --> 2546.0
people are freaking out

2542.8 --> 2549.2000000000003
and it's everywhere it's like

2546.0 --> 2552.64
yeah i watch people watch movies

2549.2 --> 2556.24
or open a magazine and every times like

2552.64 --> 2557.2
the end of the world is this going to

2556.24 --> 2560.319
war

2557.2 --> 2563.359
it's like it's gonna arwen i've got news

2560.319 --> 2567.119
it's gonna be tomorrow

2563.359 --> 2567.119
and you know tomorrow never comes

2567.52 --> 2572.4
because it's always now it's it's not

2570.4 --> 2575.28
you know

2572.4 --> 2576.7200000000003
tomorrow is not yet so it's always

2575.28 --> 2579.8390000000004
tomorrow

2576.72 --> 2583.52
all right but one day

2579.839 --> 2583.839
something will happen and all we can do

2583.52 --> 2587.119
is

2583.839 --> 2590.319
prepare and hope to be

2587.119 --> 2592.2400000000002
overcomers somehow

2590.319 --> 2593.359
and i don't mean that in a hopeless way

2592.24 --> 2595.2
i just

2593.359 --> 2596.72
don't want to get into all the details

2595.2 --> 2600.64
of

2596.72 --> 2602.56
what how does a human overcome something

2600.64 --> 2606.16
that's so

2602.56 --> 2609.44
huge so powerful

2606.16 --> 2612.7999999999997
that they aren't built

2609.44 --> 2614.96
to fight it directly you have to

2612.8 --> 2618.6400000000003
you have to be part of something bigger

2614.96 --> 2618.64
that has already overcome it

2618.96 --> 2623.359
i don't really know that's cryptic

2621.04 --> 2623.359
enough

2623.76 --> 2629.5200000000004
i just know that whenever

2627.52 --> 2631.92
it's gonna happen it's gonna happen

2629.52 --> 2632.88
because the people in control decide

2631.92 --> 2634.64
it's gonna happen

2632.88 --> 2636.56
and then it's basically going to be

2634.64 --> 2639.68
whatever excuse

2636.56 --> 2640.88
me they'll set up they'll fabricate or

2639.68 --> 2644.8799999999997
they'll actually

2640.88 --> 2646.96
trigger themselves could it could be

2644.88 --> 2649.2000000000003
something so stupid even that it's not

2646.96 --> 2650.8
it's not even like an assassination of

2649.2 --> 2653.359
an important person that's much more

2650.8 --> 2656.48
difficult these days anyway

2653.359 --> 2657.359
rather just like oh this person just got

2656.48 --> 2659.599
a toothache

2657.359 --> 2661.92
and then they went to the dentist and

2659.599 --> 2663.52
then somehow something went wrong and

2661.92 --> 2666.48
they died

2663.52 --> 2668.16
something stupid like that and then oh

2666.48 --> 2670.64
my god now everything

2668.16 --> 2671.52
changed because that negotiation that

2670.64 --> 2672.96
was underway

2671.52 --> 2674.839
certainly doesn't work anymore and

2672.96 --> 2678.2400000000002
suddenly all the parties are like oh

2674.839 --> 2678.24
[ __ ] okay

2680.16 --> 2685.52
because somebody broke their tooth i

2683.04 --> 2685.52
know right

2685.76 --> 2692.7200000000003
they pushed the wrong button yes

2688.96 --> 2695.599
i'm so uh i'm less afraid

2692.72 --> 2696.72
if there is any fear in me i'm less

2695.599 --> 2698.6400000000003
concerned

2696.72 --> 2700.56
about the government because i

2698.64 --> 2703.52
understand how they work

2700.56 --> 2703.7599999999998
than i am about the people who could be

2703.52 --> 2707.52
be

2703.76 --> 2710.3190000000004
fomented and mob um

2707.52 --> 2712.96
you know mass hypnotized or influenced

2710.319 --> 2716.64
to do stuff to people who

2712.96 --> 2720.16
to the truthers and whatnot that they

2716.64 --> 2723.04
could actually cause damage to people

2720.16 --> 2723.5989999999997
and property just because someone said

2723.04 --> 2727.839
hey

2723.599 --> 2730.1600000000003
those are the terrorists go get them

2727.839 --> 2730.16
all right

2731.04 --> 2737.92
so easily influenced well the problem is

2734.8 --> 2739.04
is that if tensions become high enough

2737.92 --> 2742.64
if the strain

2739.04 --> 2743.119
financial cultural social becomes high

2742.64 --> 2745.7599999999998
enough

2743.119 --> 2747.52
eventually people don't even care

2745.76 --> 2750.48
anymore

2747.52 --> 2753.119
they'll just say okay we'll just take

2750.48 --> 2753.119
this out

2753.28 --> 2757.8390000000004
because we're allowed to and we don't

2756.16 --> 2759.1189999999997
care if it doesn't make any sense

2757.839 --> 2761.52
anymore

2759.119 --> 2764.7200000000003
because the strain is just too high and

2761.52 --> 2764.72
something's got to give

2764.88 --> 2770.96
that's a big problem and that's also

2768.56 --> 2771.7599999999998
quite worrisome when you see that

2770.96 --> 2775.68
detention

2771.76 --> 2779.3590000000004
is being amped up so badly

2775.68 --> 2780.72
like so badly that everyone should be

2779.359 --> 2784.64
noticing it

2780.72 --> 2786.7999999999997
everyone should notice like this is not

2784.64 --> 2788.72
like five years ago the way the

2786.8 --> 2791.599
narrative rolls out

2788.72 --> 2792.9599999999996
what they touch with it that's just it's

2791.599 --> 2796.079
a natural that's

2792.96 --> 2800.8
not how humans

2796.079 --> 2803.44
do things that's only how stressed out

2800.8 --> 2805.52
crazy people that have lost themselves

2803.44 --> 2808.2400000000002
act

2805.52 --> 2810.319
yeah and there unfortunately are quite

2808.24 --> 2813.359
some of them out there many

2810.319 --> 2815.52
people that just that

2813.359 --> 2816.88
as i said can't handle any of this and

2815.52 --> 2819.599
it just like

2816.88 --> 2822.0
screw it i'm gonna be completely loose

2819.599 --> 2825.3590000000004
doing whatever i want

2822.0 --> 2827.44
i can do what i want and play

2825.359 --> 2828.96
games all day and go completely

2827.44 --> 2832.0
ballistic and

2828.96 --> 2832.7200000000003
get really pissed off for absolutely

2832.0 --> 2835.92
obviously

2832.72 --> 2839.1189999999997
no good reason whatsoever and

2835.92 --> 2841.92
and just attack things for no

2839.119 --> 2844.0
reason just because they can't handle

2841.92 --> 2847.119
the world

2844.0 --> 2849.52
and nobody seems to care

2847.119 --> 2851.599
that's a big problem as well is that as

2849.52 --> 2852.16
people are going ballistic everybody's

2851.599 --> 2854.319
like

2852.16 --> 2855.359
oh what you know they're just doing the

2854.319 --> 2860.079
things it's

2855.359 --> 2862.16
normal oh look this person is

2860.079 --> 2864.2400000000002
is obviously an alcoholic so i'm just

2862.16 --> 2867.2
gonna tell them to enjoy the drink

2864.24 --> 2869.359
every time and not not a single time

2867.2 --> 2872.3999999999996
like maybe you should

2869.359 --> 2874.72
you know cut back a little no no just

2872.4 --> 2875.52
no it's all right you know you just go

2874.72 --> 2878.9599999999996
kill yourself

2875.52 --> 2882.319
it's all fine yeah

2878.96 --> 2886.559
it's they're so disassociative and

2882.319 --> 2889.7599999999998
disconnected all right it's

2886.559 --> 2893.119
amazing yeah i'm

2889.76 --> 2895.28
back on a positive note

2893.119 --> 2897.2000000000003
yeah not so positive i'm seeing this

2895.28 --> 2900.6400000000003
chemtrail being sprayed right in front

2897.2 --> 2904.0789999999997
of me

2900.64 --> 2907.04
yuck why

2904.079 --> 2908.6400000000003
is the kitty cat around is it has it

2907.04 --> 2911.2799999999997
visited you again or is it

2908.64 --> 2913.68
out there it's out there i haven't seen

2911.28 --> 2916.4
it in a while

2913.68 --> 2918.319
they do that it'll come back but yeah

2916.4 --> 2919.359
with this type of weather it's probably

2918.319 --> 2923.44
looking around for

2919.359 --> 2926.5589999999997
other lady cats because it was a male

2923.44 --> 2928.7200000000003
you know i don't i don't know i don't

2926.559 --> 2929.6800000000003
think it's castrated i'm not sure though

2928.72 --> 2931.9199999999996
right

2929.68 --> 2931.9199999999996
right

2933.04 --> 2936.24
so the three feral cats that we've been

2935.76 --> 2938.96
feeding

2936.24 --> 2940.0789999999997
and uh we observe well we've been

2938.96 --> 2942.0
observing them

2940.079 --> 2944.319
since they were born the mother the

2942.0 --> 2946.64
mother cat was feral

2944.319 --> 2947.44
um the father cat may have been a little

2946.64 --> 2950.64
bit more

2947.44 --> 2954.0
sociable and friendly but

2950.64 --> 2956.72
um two of them

2954.0 --> 2958.0
the two males looked like the father and

2956.72 --> 2960.9599999999996
acted like the father

2958.0 --> 2962.0
the two females are more like the mother

2960.96 --> 2965.2
but one of them

2962.0 --> 2966.48
is um starting to be more responsive

2965.2 --> 2968.5589999999997
where the other one is still very

2966.48 --> 2970.88
skittish if you reach out

2968.559 --> 2973.0400000000004
and try to touch her she she just pulls

2970.88 --> 2975.2000000000003
back she won't even come to the food

2973.04 --> 2976.319
unless you know until i've removed

2975.2 --> 2980.64
myself yeah

2976.319 --> 2982.8
a scaredy cat yes so she's very

2980.64 --> 2984.24
but they are the three of them all it's

2982.8 --> 2986.079
three now one of them i

2984.24 --> 2987.839
we disappeared we don't know what

2986.079 --> 2990.1600000000003
happened to it

2987.839 --> 2991.7599999999998
but the three of them still come to the

2990.16 --> 2995.359
doorstep

2991.76 --> 2997.92
and um they don't seem to be

2995.359 --> 3000.0789999999997
mating or anything so my daughter and i

2997.92 --> 3003.28
had a discussion that maybe

3000.079 --> 3006.48
something genetic happened depending on

3003.28 --> 3009.6800000000003
what the mix was with the between the

3006.48 --> 3011.76
mother and the father cats

3009.68 --> 3014.24
there might be a genetic thing that

3011.76 --> 3016.96
they're not even

3014.24 --> 3017.5989999999997
doing anything the girls aren't going

3016.96 --> 3022.2400000000002
into

3017.599 --> 3022.2400000000002
uh what do you call it

3023.92 --> 3030.48
where they have the the need whatever

3027.44 --> 3032.48
oh they're not yeah they're not getting

3030.48 --> 3035.359
or anything and the boys the boy doesn't

3032.48 --> 3038.4
seem to be interested in anything at all

3035.359 --> 3041.2
yeah yeah none of that

3038.4 --> 3042.2400000000002
at all and so we thought well maybe

3041.2 --> 3044.64
maybe they're

3042.24 --> 3046.0
just frigid or something impotent or

3044.64 --> 3048.319
something

3046.0 --> 3048.319
you know

3050.24 --> 3055.839
maybe they ate maybe they ate too much

3052.8 --> 3055.8390000000004
soy laced cat food

3056.0 --> 3059.119
i don't know what they put in there

3057.359 --> 3063.2
these days you know right no

3059.119 --> 3066.839
right oh i hate that

3063.2 --> 3069.68
oh god talking about soy that was just

3066.839 --> 3071.2
terrible

3069.68 --> 3073.44
i shouldn't even make these type of

3071.2 --> 3075.4399999999996
jokes you know but i was there at the

3073.44 --> 3078.7200000000003
supermarket

3075.44 --> 3080.0
getting my class on and some nice orange

3078.72 --> 3082.3999999999996
juice

3080.0 --> 3083.599
and then i thought oh yeah i get this uh

3082.4 --> 3087.839
this orange juice

3083.599 --> 3090.8
last minute and there just was this guy

3087.839 --> 3091.52
and he was like buying slightly more

3090.8 --> 3093.44
expensive

3091.52 --> 3094.88
chocolates for his grandmother that was

3093.44 --> 3097.68
kind of cute

3094.88 --> 3099.28
and then he treated himself to a bottle

3097.68 --> 3102.72
of soy milk

3099.28 --> 3105.28
oh my and he had glasses of course

3102.72 --> 3105.7599999999998
and he looked like sloppy and it was

3105.28 --> 3109.76
like

3105.76 --> 3110.48
oh [ __ ] i wasn't what i would want to

3109.76 --> 3114.079
say like

3110.48 --> 3117.599
sorry boy but that's gonna totally ruin

3114.079 --> 3120.079
my reputation if i do that

3117.599 --> 3120.88
hey at least he was drinking organic soy

3120.079 --> 3123.2000000000003
you know

3120.88 --> 3124.0
organic soy boys are not as bad as

3123.2 --> 3127.52
regular soy

3124.0 --> 3130.0
boys true that at least they're not

3127.52 --> 3132.4
like poisoning themselves with this

3130.0 --> 3135.52
terrible

3132.4 --> 3139.359
gmo pesticide crap

3135.52 --> 3143.52
organic soy is not as bad as regular soy

3139.359 --> 3146.7999999999997
but it's still yeah extra estrogen

3143.52 --> 3150.079
guys shouldn't be drinking that

3146.8 --> 3152.88
they i think everyone needs to

3150.079 --> 3153.8390000000004
manage their own you know be aware of

3152.88 --> 3156.96
what their physical

3153.839 --> 3160.72
needs are and what effect

3156.96 --> 3163.52
certain foods have on them

3160.72 --> 3164.16
because just from having different blood

3163.52 --> 3167.68
types and

3164.16 --> 3170.72
different rh one should be aware that

3167.68 --> 3172.5589999999997
it's not a one size fits all

3170.72 --> 3174.16
and that our bodies process things

3172.559 --> 3177.8390000000004
differently and because

3174.16 --> 3181.04
of the effects of so many chemical

3177.839 --> 3183.2
and environmental factors

3181.04 --> 3184.96
we we might have a reaction to something

3183.2 --> 3186.24
oh i'm allergic to peanuts

3184.96 --> 3188.079
and it turns out you're actually

3186.24 --> 3192.7999999999997
allergic to the uh

3188.079 --> 3195.28
chemical uh treatment that it's received

3192.8 --> 3197.04
and they did it to the wheat they

3195.28 --> 3198.8
they're doing it to the rice they did it

3197.04 --> 3202.079
to the soy

3198.8 --> 3205.119
look um i never heard of that before

3202.079 --> 3206.0
in brazil well you know they'll go i'm

3205.119 --> 3208.559
gluten

3206.0 --> 3210.4
sensitive and it turns out it's not that

3208.559 --> 3213.119
you're gluten sensitive it's that you

3210.4 --> 3214.1600000000003
you you have an allergic reaction to a

3213.119 --> 3217.6800000000003
certain type of

3214.16 --> 3218.7999999999997
lectin or or a food so it's a do

3217.68 --> 3222.0
anything

3218.8 --> 3225.3590000000004
isn't it like a certain fungi that gets

3222.0 --> 3227.2
on that thing it connects that it could

3225.359 --> 3230.4
even be that i think the allergy from

3227.2 --> 3230.3999999999996
gluten comes from that

3231.04 --> 3238.5589999999997
they finally narrowed it down but it was

3234.16 --> 3242.319
when i was living in brazil from the

3238.559 --> 3245.0400000000004
uh okay so i'm born in 61.

3242.319 --> 3246.319
way before that brazil was already using

3245.04 --> 3249.68
soy

3246.319 --> 3252.96
as a source of oil cooking oil

3249.68 --> 3253.52
right and they had tofu they had all

3252.96 --> 3257.68
kinds of

3253.52 --> 3261.599
products that were soy based protein and

3257.68 --> 3264.64
nobody none of the men were acting um

3261.599 --> 3266.1600000000003
effeminate in the sense that or or just

3264.64 --> 3268.7999999999997
weird

3266.16 --> 3270.3999999999996
they were normal so something had to

3268.8 --> 3273.92
have happened

3270.4 --> 3276.48
since then that

3273.92 --> 3277.599
things must have been done to the to the

3276.48 --> 3280.96
plantations

3277.599 --> 3284.079
well i know a little bit about that and

3280.96 --> 3284.96
i did through natural news mostly it's

3284.079 --> 3287.6800000000003
oh my god

3284.96 --> 3288.079
like mike adams yeah he'd be a glober

3287.68 --> 3291.68
but

3288.079 --> 3293.92
he has such amazing information

3291.68 --> 3296.319
about food and everything and the thing

3293.92 --> 3297.6800000000003
with soy is it's really about how it's

3296.319 --> 3300.88
being

3297.68 --> 3303.44
uh produced in the factories

3300.88 --> 3304.0
how they extract it because there is

3303.44 --> 3306.2400000000002
like the

3304.0 --> 3308.88
protein part and then there is a core

3306.24 --> 3311.1189999999997
part and that core part really has all

3308.88 --> 3313.04
the estrogen

3311.119 --> 3315.119
in it and that's really unhealthy and

3313.04 --> 3318.72
they used to

3315.119 --> 3321.2000000000003
extract that bit take it out use it for

3318.72 --> 3321.839
medical purposes menopause all that and

3321.2 --> 3325.52
just get

3321.839 --> 3327.119
the protein for the food but nowadays

3325.52 --> 3329.92
there's just factories that don't do

3327.119 --> 3333.2000000000003
that and just take it entirely

3329.92 --> 3336.799
and of course since the 90s

3333.2 --> 3337.68
there has been the gmo soy it was the

3336.799 --> 3341.359
actual

3337.68 --> 3344.319
first gmo modified

3341.359 --> 3345.359
plant that was introduced and started to

3344.319 --> 3347.7599999999998
become

3345.359 --> 3348.64
mass produced and that's a terrible

3347.76 --> 3351.8390000000004
terrible thing

3348.64 --> 3352.96
that that happened one of the biggest

3351.839 --> 3356.16
agricultural

3352.96 --> 3358.2400000000002
disasters in human history

3356.16 --> 3360.16
it is it's horrible and he did it to

3358.24 --> 3363.839
wheat also

3360.16 --> 3363.839
and corn

3364.96 --> 3369.44
but it started out with soy and they

3368.0 --> 3374.4
even recognized that

3369.44 --> 3378.079
it's incredibly hard to even find

3374.4 --> 3381.44
and contaminated soy true because

3378.079 --> 3382.799
it spread out so badly that you really

3381.44 --> 3386.2000000000003
have to make

3382.799 --> 3390.0
extra hard effort to find original

3386.2 --> 3392.72
non-modified soy it's still out there

3390.0 --> 3393.04
but yeah if you're just gonna mass farm

3392.72 --> 3396.0
it

3393.04 --> 3397.44
it's very likely to start turning into

3396.0 --> 3399.92
gmo soy

3397.44 --> 3401.68
and all that has to happen actually is

3399.92 --> 3404.079
for the airplanes to go over and

3401.68 --> 3405.44
do the spraying and i i mean the low

3404.079 --> 3408.48
flyers not

3405.44 --> 3411.04
not just the the uh

3408.48 --> 3412.2400000000002
you know the high ones with the

3411.04 --> 3415.839
chemtrails but

3412.24 --> 3418.9599999999996
the low flying ones can release

3415.839 --> 3422.5589999999997
um genetic modifying

3418.96 --> 3424.64
sprays chemicals i don't even want to

3422.559 --> 3427.6800000000003
consider that that could be real

3424.64 --> 3429.5989999999997
that is so terrifying to me

3427.68 --> 3432.16
that they could remotely genetically

3429.599 --> 3435.04
modify if that is the case then

3432.16 --> 3436.64
there has to be some serious serious

3435.04 --> 3439.68
executions going on

3436.64 --> 3444.0789999999997
oh anyone even considering doing that

3439.68 --> 3448.64
should just be drug out of their homes

3444.079 --> 3448.6400000000003
yeah the thing of it is insane

3448.72 --> 3452.319
i don't i literally don't want to

3450.4 --> 3455.44
consider that that is even possible

3452.319 --> 3457.44
i understand but always bear in mind

3455.44 --> 3458.839
that there's there's always been an

3457.44 --> 3462.16
escape

3458.839 --> 3463.2
provided even you you know with the

3462.16 --> 3466.64
worst of the

3463.2 --> 3468.72
conditions um we

3466.64 --> 3471.1189999999997
have all been made aware of the

3468.72 --> 3474.0789999999997
properties of the distilled water

3471.119 --> 3474.6400000000003
and how it works to extract all those

3474.079 --> 3477.28
things

3474.64 --> 3478.0789999999997
from our systems once once they've been

3477.28 --> 3481.599
ingested

3478.079 --> 3483.3590000000004
so um

3481.599 --> 3485.839
it's it's not that i recommend that

3483.359 --> 3489.92
everyone go ahead and eat gmo

3485.839 --> 3491.2799999999997
foods on the contrary but the cleansing

3489.92 --> 3494.0
needs to happen

3491.28 --> 3496.079
there will be build up otherwise and you

3494.0 --> 3499.28
know you get all clogged up and

3496.079 --> 3503.04
your your systems fail so

3499.28 --> 3503.76
it's it's i'm thankful in opposition of

3503.04 --> 3507.2799999999997
the

3503.76 --> 3508.6400000000003
the evil that of people do i'm thankful

3507.28 --> 3511.2000000000003
for the

3508.64 --> 3512.4
the ability and the option the knowledge

3511.2 --> 3516.72
to

3512.4 --> 3519.76
know what to do to get rid of it

3516.72 --> 3522.16
and there is one thing though about

3519.76 --> 3524.079
genetic modification that i learned

3522.16 --> 3525.52
there was a great relief although yeah

3524.079 --> 3528.2400000000002
it's so

3525.52 --> 3529.68
out there now genetic modification is so

3528.24 --> 3532.64
out there

3529.68 --> 3533.9199999999996
literally like that new gaming group i i

3532.64 --> 3536.319
talked about it

3533.92 --> 3538.16
woman that's actually the game master is

3536.319 --> 3540.48
a laboratory genetic

3538.16 --> 3541.5989999999997
modifier expert who's been doing that

3540.48 --> 3544.079
from the start

3541.599 --> 3545.119
she knows everything about it it just

3544.079 --> 3547.2000000000003
like

3545.119 --> 3548.1600000000003
scares the [ __ ] out of me and at the

3547.2 --> 3550.0789999999997
same time like

3548.16 --> 3551.359
i kind of really want to know that

3550.079 --> 3553.76
expert knowledge

3551.359 --> 3556.0
because probably nobody else out there

3553.76 --> 3556.4
will know the details as well as she

3556.0 --> 3558.48
does

3556.4 --> 3561.28
and having actually done the tests and

3558.48 --> 3562.16
having access to all that statistical

3561.28 --> 3565.599
knowledge

3562.16 --> 3567.359
yeah but what i heard even some years

3565.599 --> 3569.599
ago was that

3567.359 --> 3571.7599999999998
there's another thing about genetically

3569.599 --> 3574.559
modified organisms

3571.76 --> 3577.28
and that is that apparently if you just

3574.559 --> 3579.6800000000003
leave them to their devices

3577.28 --> 3582.1600000000003
eventually they will exterminate

3579.68 --> 3585.359
themselves the genetically modified

3582.16 --> 3585.359
aspects will

3585.599 --> 3589.28
extinguish naturally and that's really

3588.64 --> 3592.0789999999997
hopeful

3589.28 --> 3593.6800000000003
because richie's like oh my god you have

3592.079 --> 3597.2000000000003
a corn fields of

3593.68 --> 3599.04
gmo non-gmo corn you put a couple of gmo

3597.2 --> 3599.359
corn in there and it's going to spread

3599.04 --> 3601.599
out

3599.359 --> 3604.0
well apparently that doesn't actually

3601.599 --> 3604.0
happen

3604.48 --> 3608.559
it's less fertile and it's logical it's

3606.96 --> 3610.96
mutated so it's

3608.559 --> 3612.0
outside of the blueprint of the original

3610.96 --> 3614.559
plant

3612.0 --> 3616.88
and it actually dies out so if you don't

3614.559 --> 3620.1600000000003
keep on genetically modifying that

3616.88 --> 3621.119
[ __ ] and planting it it's gonna

3620.16 --> 3624.16
naturally

3621.119 --> 3627.2000000000003
die off so literally if

3624.16 --> 3630.319
at one time genetic modification

3627.2 --> 3633.4399999999996
of crops was forbidden

3630.319 --> 3635.839
entirely i'm getting some feedback here

3633.44 --> 3637.599
if it was forbidden entirely then

3635.839 --> 3641.04
there's a good chance that

3637.599 --> 3642.48
like in the span of 10 years 20 years

3641.04 --> 3644.5589999999997
there's just going to be no more

3642.48 --> 3647.44
genetically modified plants out there

3644.559 --> 3649.76
because they've all died out

3647.44 --> 3652.079
that's a good thing i'm glad of that so

3649.76 --> 3654.1600000000003
that kind of counterbalanced the idea of

3652.079 --> 3657.8390000000004
yeah they can spray [ __ ] and genetically

3654.16 --> 3657.839
modified which

3660.4 --> 3666.2400000000002
was they were providing seeds

3663.839 --> 3668.16
for each crop because they don't

3666.24 --> 3670.9599999999996
replicate

3668.16 --> 3673.2
you don't get seeds from the the you

3670.96 --> 3676.2400000000002
know from the produce

3673.2 --> 3677.9199999999996
um they had to send them out to the

3676.24 --> 3679.5989999999997
farmers so they were

3677.92 --> 3682.0
thus they were controlling the crops

3679.599 --> 3685.44
that were coming in on the market

3682.0 --> 3688.48
and the farmers weren't able to just

3685.44 --> 3690.16
continue using those same plants

3688.48 --> 3692.16
they wouldn't reproduce they would they

3690.16 --> 3696.0789999999997
were only good for the one

3692.16 --> 3699.5989999999997
uh fruiting so to speak

3696.079 --> 3703.4
and the farmers were noticing this and

3699.599 --> 3704.6400000000003
they were saying so if if this isn't

3703.4 --> 3707.52
reproducing

3704.64 --> 3709.2
that means it's not really alive and

3707.52 --> 3711.28
that tells me something

3709.2 --> 3712.5589999999997
so they were you know you don't even

3711.28 --> 3715.3590000000004
want to put mulch

3712.559 --> 3716.1600000000003
in your ground from that stuff you want

3715.359 --> 3718.72
to actually

3716.16 --> 3720.24
take it away and burn it and you don't

3718.72 --> 3721.1189999999997
want to put it back into the ground

3720.24 --> 3725.4399999999996
because it's

3721.119 --> 3728.799
it's almost like just disintegrated

3725.44 --> 3728.799
filter out the poisons

3729.119 --> 3734.319
don't break it down into the earth just

3731.839 --> 3738.72
into the soil because it's sick

3734.319 --> 3742.799
it's dead and it doesn't provide

3738.72 --> 3742.799
it doesn't break down and

3742.96 --> 3747.039
provide nutrition into the earth it

3746.0 --> 3750.079
doesn't

3747.039 --> 3753.2000000000003
you know it doesn't contribute anything

3750.079 --> 3755.76
it is completely dead yep

3753.2 --> 3757.359
and for it's to be it's no longer part

3755.76 --> 3760.1600000000003
of of god's design

3757.359 --> 3761.2799999999997
you could say it can't be part of life

3760.16 --> 3765.44
anymore

3761.28 --> 3768.559
we modified it and um

3765.44 --> 3771.039
you know you can eat paper but it won't

3768.559 --> 3771.039
feed you

3771.44 --> 3775.839
if your body does not have the ability

3773.52 --> 3778.24
to process it

3775.839 --> 3780.48
all it can do is either pass it through

3778.24 --> 3785.68
or put it somewhere

3780.48 --> 3785.68
and uh there are consequences

3785.92 --> 3789.359
so it pays to know what you're eating

3787.92 --> 3790.2400000000002
where you're getting it from and how

3789.359 --> 3793.5989999999997
they're

3790.24 --> 3794.0
how they are um caring for it and that's

3793.599 --> 3797.52
why

3794.0 --> 3798.64
it is so encouraging for people to have

3797.52 --> 3801.359
their own garden

3798.64 --> 3802.8799999999997
even if it's a container garden but to

3801.359 --> 3804.799
grow their own food to know where

3802.88 --> 3807.76
they're getting it from

3804.799 --> 3811.839
and and then to nourish themselves

3807.76 --> 3811.8390000000004
properly with it

3811.92 --> 3819.76
real food yep

3816.48 --> 3819.76
food that can reproduce

3820.0 --> 3827.92
is editable yeah

3825.119 --> 3829.92
it's very critical and like you we

3827.92 --> 3834.64
remember you were mentioning

3829.92 --> 3838.0
um the uh properties of plant life

3834.64 --> 3841.92
that uh they do have

3838.0 --> 3846.559
infinite numb in an infinite number of

3841.92 --> 3848.7200000000003
healing properties and i just i started

3846.559 --> 3850.559
it just made a big smile on me yesterday

3848.72 --> 3853.9199999999996
because i was remembering

3850.559 --> 3857.92
that it's written let let the herbs

3853.92 --> 3862.319
and the fruit be your your

3857.92 --> 3866.079
nourishment right and and let the herbs

3862.319 --> 3869.599
let them be thy medicine absolutely

3866.079 --> 3872.079
and they absolutely do exactly that

3869.599 --> 3874.319
and that car songs be thy medicine as

3872.079 --> 3874.319
well

3874.88 --> 3883.039
i love it bon appetit

3880.4 --> 3885.839
my french accent is coming through

3883.039 --> 3885.8390000000004
naturally

3887.44 --> 3895.52
i laughing action

3891.359 --> 3899.52
that sounded more yiddish

3895.52 --> 3899.52
direction oh boy

3899.59 --> 3905.52
[Laughter]

3902.319 --> 3908.88
you got to lay the syllables in the

3905.52 --> 3911.92
wrong position otherwise it's not

3908.88 --> 3915.28
french if a french person could

3911.92 --> 3919.599
speak english in the right way

3915.28 --> 3919.599
then it's not a french person anymore

3921.28 --> 3924.6400000000003
i still french can't really speak any

3923.68 --> 3926.72
other language

3924.64 --> 3929.1189999999997
by the way if you know a french person

3926.72 --> 3931.68
an actual french person that can talk a

3929.119 --> 3934.7200000000003
language outside of french

3931.68 --> 3937.839
you found a miracle

3934.72 --> 3937.839
then i know

3938.16 --> 3942.3999999999996
yeah well you yeah maybe you have to

3941.76 --> 3944.1600000000003
tell

3942.4 --> 3945.92
i don't know any french i've never heard

3944.16 --> 3947.52
a french person speak anything but

3945.92 --> 3950.88
french

3947.52 --> 3954.88
i've heard them try to speak english

3950.88 --> 3958.0
but that's just a couple of words

3954.88 --> 3960.7200000000003
and such a mess that nah

3958.0 --> 3961.68
well a lot of them actually do learn to

3960.72 --> 3965.0389999999998
speak

3961.68 --> 3969.52
because they they had such um

3965.039 --> 3972.7200000000003
constant relations with uh the uk

3969.52 --> 3974.48
so the language because french was the

3972.72 --> 3978.0
world language at one point

3974.48 --> 3981.52
their alternate language was english

3978.0 --> 3984.4
oh okay well maybe

3981.52 --> 3985.839
i have a particular racist bias against

3984.4 --> 3989.2000000000003
french

3985.839 --> 3992.319
then i guess no i've just seen a lot of

3989.2 --> 3995.0389999999998
bad french babies every time

3992.319 --> 3995.359
we went to spain we all they always had

3995.039 --> 3998.7200000000003
to

3995.359 --> 4001.5989999999997
pass through france and i've never had

3998.72 --> 4004.839
any good experience in doing that ever

4001.599 --> 4006.319
at restaurants at the motels it was

4004.839 --> 4010.64
always

4006.319 --> 4014.24
even my portuguese friend is very um

4010.64 --> 4017.359
um negative towards the french he says

4014.24 --> 4020.5589999999997
i don't have any good experiences to

4017.359 --> 4023.5989999999997
to uh change my mind so but that's not

4020.559 --> 4025.76
racism i don't i know it's just

4023.599 --> 4027.599
the modern slang it's the spiritual

4025.76 --> 4030.079
thing it's i always said

4027.599 --> 4031.44
and it's in retrospect i feel terrible

4030.079 --> 4034.88
now especially the

4031.44 --> 4036.0
paris yeah no it's not really the french

4034.88 --> 4038.0
anymore

4036.0 --> 4039.039
but i always said like i love france

4038.0 --> 4041.44
it's just those

4039.039 --> 4041.44
people

4044.88 --> 4049.839
if only but now i'm kind of like maybe

4048.079 --> 4051.52
maybe i should take some of that back

4049.839 --> 4052.72
maybe they should have another chance

4051.52 --> 4054.72
you know

4052.72 --> 4055.7599999999998
because what's happening right now over

4054.72 --> 4058.9599999999996
there it's just

4055.76 --> 4061.039
insane it is insane

4058.96 --> 4062.96
there's there's so much and it's hard to

4061.039 --> 4066.96
distinguish between

4062.96 --> 4069.76
what is actual social uh reform

4066.96 --> 4071.92
as to something that's being fomented

4069.76 --> 4074.1600000000003
like a you know it's a false flag

4071.92 --> 4075.76
to get your minds off while they're busy

4074.16 --> 4078.8799999999997
doing something else

4075.76 --> 4081.76
that is really gonna affect everyone

4078.88 --> 4082.799
but like in italy for the people to

4081.76 --> 4085.8390000000004
revolt against

4082.799 --> 4088.799
the vaccination that seemed

4085.839 --> 4088.799
genuine to me

4089.2 --> 4094.3999999999996
i'm not sure what to think about paris

4092.079 --> 4098.159000000001
about france

4094.4 --> 4101.6
well it's become a [ __ ] as far as

4098.159 --> 4101.599999999999
i know although we have

4101.92 --> 4107.359
it it's hard to tell i haven't been

4104.159 --> 4109.599999999999
there a long long time usually we

4107.359 --> 4111.120000000001
bypass it's not something you want to go

4109.6 --> 4113.759
through if you want a

4111.12 --> 4115.5199999999995
long journey either you go to it or you

4113.759 --> 4118.319
avoid it

4115.52 --> 4118.719
well even if they're trying to eradicate

4118.319 --> 4121.279
the

4118.719 --> 4122.4
the current system and then install the

4121.279 --> 4124.64
new one

4122.4 --> 4126.5599999999995
which will be more favorable towards the

4124.64 --> 4127.839
new world lord or whatever

4126.56 --> 4131.04
whenever they're trying to get rid of

4127.839 --> 4133.04
the old guard it usually means

4131.04 --> 4134.159
that they're just put wanting to put a

4133.04 --> 4139.679
new face on an

4134.159 --> 4142.159
old story there's nothing new about it

4139.679 --> 4143.52
it's all right i just keep watching i

4142.159 --> 4147.759
just keep

4143.52 --> 4150.159000000001
trying to uh in interpreter

4147.759 --> 4151.199
of insight into the terrible thing in a

4150.159 --> 4154.5599999999995
way is that

4151.199 --> 4158.159
yeah paris was typically hyper

4154.56 --> 4158.56
liberal culture like hyper liberal and

4158.159 --> 4160.96
they

4158.56 --> 4163.04
are it sounds really superficial but

4160.96 --> 4166.159
they're being replaced

4163.04 --> 4169.44
by it

4166.159 --> 4172.839
just is an infiltration

4169.44 --> 4176.08
group of super hostile

4172.839 --> 4179.2789999999995
anti-european people that are

4176.08 --> 4182.239
just being put there like an army

4179.279 --> 4182.88
growing ready to basically annihilate

4182.239 --> 4185.5199999999995
everyone

4182.88 --> 4187.52
and they don't give a [ __ ] they don't

4185.52 --> 4189.359
give a [ __ ] about anything

4187.52 --> 4191.759
they all they they'll literally give a

4189.359 --> 4194.400000000001
[ __ ] on the sidewalk

4191.759 --> 4194.88
you know they don't give a crap they

4194.4 --> 4196.719
don't

4194.88 --> 4198.2390000000005
give a crap about the french they don't

4196.719 --> 4200.64
give a crap about the country

4198.239 --> 4202.5599999999995
they want their stuff and they want more

4200.64 --> 4204.400000000001
and they'll destroy everything

4202.56 --> 4205.6
in the process that's who's being

4204.4 --> 4209.36
important there

4205.6 --> 4212.56
and it's crazy because it's the worst

4209.36 --> 4213.839999999999
you know even if you think like oh maybe

4212.56 --> 4216.0
we should get some

4213.84 --> 4218.2390000000005
more people from other countries other

4216.0 --> 4221.28
cultures in here and diversify

4218.239 --> 4222.959999999999
yeah okay could do

4221.28 --> 4225.12
but that's not what they're doing

4222.96 --> 4228.159
they're taking the worst

4225.12 --> 4231.5199999999995
criminal scumbags and the most

4228.159 --> 4234.879999999999
[ __ ] idiots combined

4231.52 --> 4237.040000000001
and importing them that's what they're

4234.88 --> 4240.88
actually doing now it's

4237.04 --> 4243.84
it's not refugees anymore it's not

4240.88 --> 4245.6
migrants that could actually do things

4243.84 --> 4248.88
contribute to the country

4245.6 --> 4253.360000000001
no they import scumbags and

4248.88 --> 4256.400000000001
criminals and psychopaths literally

4253.36 --> 4259.5199999999995
street slaughtering psychopaths that

4256.4 --> 4263.04
have been known to do the most horrific

4259.52 --> 4265.52
criminal [ __ ] in the open completely not

4263.04 --> 4266.719
that's what they're imparting right now

4265.52 --> 4268.56
and they know it

4266.719 --> 4270.84
and people are starting to figure this

4268.56 --> 4272.2390000000005
out because many of these people have

4270.84 --> 4273.76
records

4272.239 --> 4275.36
and they're like banned from their

4273.76 --> 4276.2390000000005
country if they would be caught in their

4275.36 --> 4280.0
own country they'd be

4276.239 --> 4284.48
executed right there we we got that

4280.0 --> 4287.76
in florida back when castro

4284.48 --> 4290.159
sent the mariellitos out and they just

4287.76 --> 4292.400000000001
basically emptied the prisons

4290.159 --> 4294.4
and sent everybody packing and and the

4292.4 --> 4297.44
states got them and

4294.4 --> 4297.44
uh it was like

4297.6 --> 4302.56
they're not refugees they are you know

4300.88 --> 4306.0
some of them were imprisoned

4302.56 --> 4306.96
for political reasons but had become

4306.0 --> 4310.08
criminalized

4306.96 --> 4313.36
so we we had this element coming in

4310.08 --> 4316.5599999999995
it wasn't people looking for refuge

4313.36 --> 4319.599999999999
it was just a dump of

4316.56 --> 4321.52
of the scum of society and

4319.6 --> 4323.1990000000005
here we're taking them in like it's you

4321.52 --> 4326.64
know so there was

4323.199 --> 4330.0
partial um it was

4326.64 --> 4334.0
covered by migration

4330.0 --> 4337.52
okay but the majority of the element was

4334.0 --> 4339.52
negative it was it was vile and then we

4337.52 --> 4341.4400000000005
started getting all the drug lords and

4339.52 --> 4344.719
whatnot going on

4341.44 --> 4347.919999999999
it was such a cia move it's so

4344.719 --> 4351.36
obvious um

4347.92 --> 4354.64
well if it feels like the cia if

4351.36 --> 4357.839999999999
yeah the new world order the controllers

4354.64 --> 4361.84
yep they are doing

4357.84 --> 4365.04
the british military conquering strategy

4361.84 --> 4368.56
getting to a place seeing what's there

4365.04 --> 4370.239
then turning the elements of each group

4368.56 --> 4372.4800000000005
against each other and let them

4370.239 --> 4375.5199999999995
completely get slaughtered

4372.48 --> 4377.759999999999
and then basically

4375.52 --> 4380.64
move in there with no resistance because

4377.76 --> 4385.679
everybody's dead

4380.64 --> 4387.84
and become rulers enslave what's left

4385.679 --> 4389.92
and do whatever they want that's what

4387.84 --> 4392.4400000000005
they're trying it's a divide and conquer

4389.92 --> 4395.84
strategy and it is being applied

4392.44 --> 4397.44
worldwide if you think this is happening

4395.84 --> 4399.04
just in the middle east or something

4397.44 --> 4401.44
with america

4399.04 --> 4404.08
and kind of in a way kind of is although

4401.44 --> 4407.12
it didn't become wider politicized

4404.08 --> 4408.5599999999995
more fronts no they're actually doing it

4407.12 --> 4411.36
to the west

4408.56 --> 4414.0
they're doing it to the west america

4411.36 --> 4417.92
europe it's all being

4414.0 --> 4420.96
carved up forcefully imported criminals

4417.92 --> 4423.4400000000005
scumbags are being injected

4420.96 --> 4424.96
like like a vaccine with poison just

4423.44 --> 4428.4
being injected it's

4424.96 --> 4429.76
been there now you deal with it right

4428.4 --> 4432.639999999999
that's what they're doing and they're

4429.76 --> 4437.04
trying to make it all collapse

4432.64 --> 4439.280000000001
actively and it's it is beyond criminal

4437.04 --> 4441.5199999999995
there's just so many people out here in

4439.28 --> 4443.759999999999
these days that just

4441.52 --> 4445.120000000001
you know it's no longer these people

4443.76 --> 4449.360000000001
should go to prison no

4445.12 --> 4451.92
there should be deaths

4449.36 --> 4452.799999999999
it's just i i don't want to say it but

4451.92 --> 4455.679
it should be

4452.8 --> 4457.360000000001
they went so far with this [ __ ] it's

4455.679 --> 4459.28
just you can't just put

4457.36 --> 4460.96
these people in prison anymore they just

4459.28 --> 4462.8
can suck

4460.96 --> 4464.64
their money that they stole from

4462.8 --> 4465.76
everything and they get a comfortable

4464.64 --> 4467.280000000001
life in their prison they're

4465.76 --> 4468.8
just going to build a little palace in

4467.28 --> 4471.199
their prison no they need to

4468.8 --> 4471.1990000000005
die

4473.04 --> 4481.12
it does need to end for sure but i

4476.64 --> 4482.8
i teasingly now call them the ciia

4481.12 --> 4485.36
controllers of internal and

4482.8 --> 4489.679
international affairs

4485.36 --> 4492.719
look at this i got some larping outside

4489.679 --> 4492.719
it's all they ever do

4495.44 --> 4499.5199999999995
there's some larping kids over there

4496.96 --> 4499.52
that's funny

4499.76 --> 4503.76
somebody's walking around with a wooden

4501.44 --> 4503.759999999999
sword

4505.04 --> 4510.88
star wars or that they might be

4508.48 --> 4513.28
uh you know he might be studying the

4510.88 --> 4516.32
crusades by now

4513.28 --> 4516.32
maybe something like that

4516.8 --> 4524.0
anyway before all this [ __ ] is over

4520.719 --> 4524.88
there will be executions and the

4524.0 --> 4530.159
norenborg

4524.88 --> 4532.8
trials are gonna be cookie

4530.159 --> 4533.599999999999
gonna be cookie absolutely it's gonna be

4532.8 --> 4536.08
like

4533.6 --> 4537.6
sure if you compare this with so many

4536.08 --> 4540.08
people that went into this

4537.6 --> 4542.400000000001
like how many people were executed with

4540.08 --> 4545.6
the nuremberg trials

4542.4 --> 4547.679
thousands maybe i don't know well it's

4545.6 --> 4548.400000000001
going to be hundreds of thousands this

4547.679 --> 4551.04
time because

4548.4 --> 4552.4
that many people went that badly

4551.04 --> 4555.679
overboard

4552.4 --> 4559.679
turned into demonic maniacs way

4555.679 --> 4563.52
way beyond what the nazis ever did ever

4559.679 --> 4564.96
they were civilized civilized compared

4563.52 --> 4567.92
to these people

4564.96 --> 4568.32
that are now doing all this [ __ ] they

4567.92 --> 4571.1990000000005
were

4568.32 --> 4571.92
civilized compared to this they were

4571.199 --> 4574.719
just

4571.92 --> 4577.12
that was just uh boot camp you know

4574.719 --> 4580.96
testing around and they've refined

4577.12 --> 4583.5199999999995
their um tactics and their approach

4580.96 --> 4586.2390000000005
and their they try to be more subtle but

4583.52 --> 4588.080000000001
again if you know what to look for

4586.239 --> 4589.44
if you know what a manipulator does and

4588.08 --> 4590.8
you know what a psychopath and a

4589.44 --> 4593.839999999999
sociopath and

4590.8 --> 4595.76
blah blah all these things are you know

4593.84 --> 4598.0
what signs to look for

4595.76 --> 4599.4400000000005
and and the unfortunate thing is they

4598.0 --> 4602.48
have infiltrated

4599.44 --> 4605.199
the justice system from top to bottom

4602.48 --> 4606.879999999999
so that whenever anything comes across

4605.199 --> 4608.799999999999
they have control over it

4606.88 --> 4610.400000000001
and they can they can do social

4608.8 --> 4614.2390000000005
engineering from there

4610.4 --> 4616.48
they can do they can prevent justice

4614.239 --> 4618.159
and thus there is no progress because

4616.48 --> 4620.239
justice is already slow

4618.159 --> 4621.199
it's the thing that society kind of

4620.239 --> 4623.36
relies upon

4621.199 --> 4624.5599999999995
keeps stable because of it and there is

4623.36 --> 4626.639999999999
no progress

4624.56 --> 4628.2390000000005
and so everything is postponed

4626.64 --> 4632.159000000001
indefinitely just like

4628.239 --> 4633.759999999999
going to mars postponed indefinitely

4632.159 --> 4636.08
and that is part of the reason why i

4633.76 --> 4638.4800000000005
called out like yeah we need to get

4636.08 --> 4639.76
our knives get our shotguns go on the

4638.48 --> 4641.759999999999
street and kill

4639.76 --> 4642.88
the pedophiles drag them out of the

4641.76 --> 4646.08
courthouses and

4642.88 --> 4646.88
end it because it's never gonna end any

4646.08 --> 4649.199
other way i

4646.88 --> 4650.0
still stand behind it it's so it freaks

4649.199 --> 4652.4
me out every

4650.0 --> 4653.12
time i think about it i don't see any

4652.4 --> 4655.44
other way

4653.12 --> 4657.5199999999995
and i think that there's a lot of people

4655.44 --> 4660.0
now starting to realize it

4657.52 --> 4661.040000000001
there is no other way these people

4660.0 --> 4663.92
demand

4661.04 --> 4664.96
to be murdered by us they demand it

4663.92 --> 4669.12
there's no

4664.96 --> 4671.36
other way to end it and i'd

4669.12 --> 4673.76
it's just gonna have to roll out the way

4671.36 --> 4675.28
it's gonna roll out it's

4673.76 --> 4677.280000000001
i don't know when it's gonna trigger i

4675.28 --> 4678.32
don't know how much more madness we need

4677.28 --> 4681.04
to

4678.32 --> 4683.28
envelop need to get rolled out over us

4681.04 --> 4686.56
before it happens

4683.28 --> 4689.92
maybe there will be some military

4686.56 --> 4692.8
fringe group that's gonna do it

4689.92 --> 4694.32
i don't know it's like that would be

4692.8 --> 4696.56
almost too convenient

4694.32 --> 4699.04
no i don't think that anyone will be

4696.56 --> 4702.320000000001
allowed to get away from actually

4699.04 --> 4704.719
being forced by god himself by

4702.32 --> 4706.159
creation himself to do this to get out

4704.719 --> 4708.4
of your comfort zone

4706.159 --> 4710.799999999999
to get out of your safe space and

4708.4 --> 4712.719
actually take responsibility for this

4710.8 --> 4716.64
world

4712.719 --> 4719.12
actually do it actually do it not

4716.64 --> 4720.0
not sitting around oh no something must

4719.12 --> 4724.0
be done then the

4720.0 --> 4724.32
other oh that group when are they gonna

4724.0 --> 4726.96
do

4724.32 --> 4728.799999999999
something now it's gonna be pushed

4726.96 --> 4730.719
pushed pushed pushed until

4728.8 --> 4732.320000000001
people literally lose their minds

4730.719 --> 4734.96
instincts take over

4732.32 --> 4736.239
and it's gonna be done and people are

4734.96 --> 4739.679
not even going to realize

4736.239 --> 4741.12
am i doing this are we a group it's just

4739.679 --> 4743.36
going to be done

4741.12 --> 4744.719
it's going to happen a few i will call

4743.36 --> 4748.639999999999
it the fugue

4744.719 --> 4751.44
a blood rage like nothing

4748.64 --> 4752.88
anybody can even remember from history

4751.44 --> 4755.28
because it's happened before

4752.88 --> 4756.08
trust me something like that happened

4755.28 --> 4759.04
before

4756.08 --> 4762.0
it's probably way in the past way

4759.04 --> 4765.199
forgotten but it's there

4762.0 --> 4768.4
well you see in the uh again

4765.199 --> 4772.5599999999995
back to the entertainment zone

4768.4 --> 4775.92
how many shows how many movies

4772.56 --> 4776.96
are made specifically with justice

4775.92 --> 4780.56
league

4776.96 --> 4782.32
mentality and with vigilantism and

4780.56 --> 4785.1990000000005
all this take justice into your own

4782.32 --> 4788.799999999999
hands because people are tired of the

4785.199 --> 4794.239
injustice system so they

4788.8 --> 4794.2390000000005
they want to again promote the duality

4794.4 --> 4799.28
not all justice people are corrupt but

4797.36 --> 4801.12
there are so many that it's hard to find

4799.28 --> 4803.92
the uncorrupted

4801.12 --> 4806.159
and most people they're just trying the

4803.92 --> 4809.36
uncorrupted ones are just in the middle

4806.159 --> 4811.759999999999
trying to hold on like trying to prevent

4809.36 --> 4813.04
it from hundred percent corrupting so

4811.76 --> 4816.2390000000005
yeah i'm not telling

4813.04 --> 4820.719
everyone do kill everyone indiscriminate

4816.239 --> 4824.48
no the ones and look it's known

4820.719 --> 4827.44
they know the people surround them know

4824.48 --> 4828.48
everybody knows that's actually there

4827.44 --> 4830.879999999999
who's that

4828.48 --> 4832.879999999999
and trust me if a mob comes walking up

4830.88 --> 4833.52
they'll all be pointing yeah these guys

4832.88 --> 4835.6
that group

4833.52 --> 4837.1990000000005
it's them it's them here's the records

4835.6 --> 4840.639
here's all the proof please

4837.199 --> 4843.678999999999
please spare us it's them they'll do it

4840.639 --> 4843.679
and it'll happen

4844.84 --> 4847.84
so

4848.08 --> 4851.96
as always it's important to have

4850.4 --> 4855.199
individual

4851.96 --> 4858.96
responsibility and accountability

4855.199 --> 4863.36
and to walk in justice and righteousness

4858.96 --> 4867.679
and there i say holiness

4863.36 --> 4871.44
and wholesomeness and to be full of

4867.679 --> 4876.0
good and uh to

4871.44 --> 4880.5599999999995
you know depart from and come out of

4876.0 --> 4884.0
and resist evil in all its forms

4880.56 --> 4886.400000000001
i it starts with one it starts with me

4884.0 --> 4888.32
from the inside out well yeah yeah let's

4886.4 --> 4891.759999999999
start with yourself it's

4888.32 --> 4895.84
the whole flash mob blood

4891.76 --> 4898.719
fugue thing that's yeah it's not

4895.84 --> 4899.6
like something to build that's not what

4898.719 --> 4902.8
i'm saying like oh

4899.6 --> 4904.8
we gonna do it no it's i'm saying

4902.8 --> 4906.719
you're not going to be able to stop this

4904.8 --> 4910.0
from happening it's going to be

4906.719 --> 4911.04
naturally occurring completely bypassing

4910.0 --> 4913.44
our

4911.04 --> 4914.08
standard consciousness because the

4913.44 --> 4917.12
pressure

4914.08 --> 4918.719
it's just can't be stopped it's probably

4917.12 --> 4919.28
gonna happen it can't be stopped and

4918.719 --> 4921.52
yeah

4919.28 --> 4922.5599999999995
it's not something you should like oh

4921.52 --> 4926.2390000000005
let's

4922.56 --> 4926.719
work toward no no you don't want it to

4926.239 --> 4929.5199999999995
happen

4926.719 --> 4930.0
but it's probably gonna happen anyway

4929.52 --> 4933.360000000001
what i

4930.0 --> 4937.36
want is actually what i want just stay

4933.36 --> 4939.599999999999
out of it just take my own spot

4937.36 --> 4940.5599999999995
i'll defend it to the death it's like oh

4939.6 --> 4943.1990000000005
oh really

4940.56 --> 4944.080000000001
i'm i got a kid you're gonna force me to

4943.199 --> 4947.678999999999
vaccinate

4944.08 --> 4951.36
okay come at me bro i will

4947.679 --> 4953.36
freaking cut you down if you try it

4951.36 --> 4956.239
you're gonna bring police force i'll cut

4953.36 --> 4958.5599999999995
them down you're not gonna do it

4956.239 --> 4959.919999999999
i will fight to the death to prevent

4958.56 --> 4962.159000000001
that from happening

4959.92 --> 4964.08
that kind of [ __ ] i'll make a stand i'll

4962.159 --> 4966.159
do it american style

4964.08 --> 4969.44
and hey if enough people do this

4966.159 --> 4971.5199999999995
whatever the law says you know

4969.44 --> 4973.44
they're not gonna do anything about it

4971.52 --> 4976.88
like half the laws over here

4973.44 --> 4978.719
are total illusional [ __ ] anyway

4976.88 --> 4980.400000000001
they say things this you're mandated to

4978.719 --> 4983.36
do this you must do this or that

4980.4 --> 4984.719
and then you look in the laws like no

4983.36 --> 4986.96
that's complete [ __ ]

4984.719 --> 4988.4800000000005
that's just a story if i don't do it

4986.96 --> 4991.04
you're not gonna do anything about it

4988.48 --> 4994.879999999999
because it's not real

4991.04 --> 4999.84
that's already the world right now

4994.88 --> 5002.96
so i'm gonna do it according to natural

4999.84 --> 5006.0
godly right to self-defense

5002.96 --> 5007.199
godly right it is divine a divine right

5006.0 --> 5010.08
to defend yourself

5007.199 --> 5012.239
no matter the consequence and i will do

5010.08 --> 5012.239
it

5013.199 --> 5018.239
and uh there needs to be justice there

5016.0 --> 5021.199
needs to be exposure

5018.239 --> 5023.839999999999
of what evil deeds they have done and

5021.199 --> 5027.12
and then there has to be an end

5023.84 --> 5030.88
because they've reversed it all again

5027.12 --> 5034.0
now they have long drawn out court cases

5030.88 --> 5037.28
and long drawn out sentences

5034.0 --> 5041.52
instead of having and i i do

5037.28 --> 5043.84
understand some people are innocent okay

5041.52 --> 5046.400000000001
some people have been trapped into the

5043.84 --> 5047.84
system and they hadn't even done

5046.4 --> 5050.08
what they're accused of doing but

5047.84 --> 5052.2390000000005
they're they're talked into

5050.08 --> 5053.36
copying a plea and then they live with

5052.239 --> 5055.678999999999
the consequences

5053.36 --> 5056.799999999999
those are the innocents that need to be

5055.679 --> 5058.96
sorted out

5056.8 --> 5059.92
right but yeah but those are not the

5058.96 --> 5062.32
ones that

5059.92 --> 5063.1990000000005
require the maximum punishment as it

5062.32 --> 5065.28
were

5063.199 --> 5066.638999999999
they need to get a big slap on the

5065.28 --> 5069.12
fingers they need to

5066.639 --> 5070.0
that kind of [ __ ] but no the true

5069.12 --> 5073.199
monsters that

5070.0 --> 5075.679
just organize this knowingly and

5073.199 --> 5077.12
brag about it among their friends those

5075.679 --> 5079.92
people

5077.12 --> 5081.12
once they are they need to go they need

5079.92 --> 5085.1990000000005
once they go through

5081.12 --> 5087.199
the trial then the justice needs to be

5085.199 --> 5090.159
swift i mean it's it's got to be

5087.199 --> 5091.36
over with because what are we doing

5090.159 --> 5093.36
supporting all these

5091.36 --> 5094.639
these people letting them live live live

5093.36 --> 5097.12
live live and make

5094.639 --> 5098.0
things worse the more they get the more

5097.12 --> 5100.88
they actually

5098.0 --> 5102.8
make things worse and they love it i

5100.88 --> 5104.88
mean

5102.8 --> 5106.2390000000005
does anyone understand that the fact

5104.88 --> 5110.2390000000005
that they're sitting there

5106.239 --> 5113.04
sitting there fuming and projecting all

5110.239 --> 5114.48
all these thoughts and evil things even

5113.04 --> 5118.0
just at the prison

5114.48 --> 5121.28
whether they touch anybody or not their

5118.0 --> 5124.56
intention and their uh

5121.28 --> 5128.32
putting it into the the you know

5124.56 --> 5131.360000000001
into the world it just keeps

5128.32 --> 5131.92
adding to the to the negativity and to

5131.36 --> 5136.4
the

5131.92 --> 5138.8
the evil power yep and it also

5136.4 --> 5140.32
has this effect that the stronger the

5138.8 --> 5143.92
evil becomes

5140.32 --> 5147.04
the more these submissive ones

5143.92 --> 5148.88
sleep they sleep deeper because they

5147.04 --> 5151.679
have to they have to to just

5148.88 --> 5154.400000000001
not see that terrible terrible evil

5151.679 --> 5156.4
that's ruling over them what matters is

5154.4 --> 5158.879999999999
we're protected they are over there

5156.4 --> 5162.638999999999
behind those walls and we're out here

5158.88 --> 5162.639
who are the actually free people

5162.88 --> 5167.36
nobody not not them not and not the

5165.679 --> 5170.88
others

5167.36 --> 5172.96
so right once you wake up

5170.88 --> 5175.84
you start seeing certain things

5172.96 --> 5178.32
differently um

5175.84 --> 5179.4400000000005
some people find freedom in the prison

5178.32 --> 5182.88
system

5179.44 --> 5185.678999999999
and i don't and i mean spiritual freedom

5182.88 --> 5187.84
and others just get further bogged down

5185.679 --> 5191.36
into the physical

5187.84 --> 5195.04
uh ugliness of it all

5191.36 --> 5198.32
to get sucked into it ah

5195.04 --> 5201.199
god let's stop talking about it

5198.32 --> 5202.639
it was good to be talked about and i

5201.199 --> 5205.678999999999
lost

5202.639 --> 5208.4800000000005
darwin it's just like even the

5205.679 --> 5211.84
the not so terrible trolls are just like

5208.48 --> 5211.839999999999
freaking out here

5212.48 --> 5217.919999999999
so gardening um

5215.679 --> 5219.92
yeah you made some of you that were

5217.92 --> 5221.679
blocked by me you may be unblocked at

5219.92 --> 5225.28
some later points

5221.679 --> 5228.32
but don't do that just don't

5225.28 --> 5228.639
you know i'm not advocating violence i'm

5228.32 --> 5231.28
not

5228.639 --> 5232.4800000000005
telling to you know what we're showing

5231.28 --> 5235.759999999999
here what i'm showing

5232.48 --> 5239.04
is that things are just [ __ ] up beyond

5235.76 --> 5242.56
the possibility of civilization

5239.04 --> 5245.679
that's what i'm showing like it went

5242.56 --> 5246.96
too far it's there it's not going to get

5245.679 --> 5249.28
there it's there

5246.96 --> 5251.04
that's the problem and not saying oh we

5249.28 --> 5253.84
must do this we're going to have

5251.04 --> 5255.5199999999995
no i'm saying you can't stop it from

5253.84 --> 5257.12
happening whether you like it or not

5255.52 --> 5259.120000000001
it's going to happen

5257.12 --> 5261.04
that that that storm it's going to

5259.12 --> 5263.199
happen i predict it

5261.04 --> 5264.56
i'm not saying i'm organizing it i am

5263.199 --> 5267.759999999999
not organizing it

5264.56 --> 5269.52
i don't know anyone really you know but

5267.76 --> 5272.96
i'm saying it's happening and we're

5269.52 --> 5276.0
seeing the four boats of it the

5272.96 --> 5278.159
the level of intensity of the protest is

5276.0 --> 5280.719
amping up you used to have the

5278.159 --> 5282.799999999999
occupy wall street was really peaceful

5280.719 --> 5283.92
now you have the yellow vest movement

5282.8 --> 5285.92
not that peaceful

5283.92 --> 5288.2390000000005
still peaceful but it's a lot more

5285.92 --> 5290.0
hardcore well guess what

5288.239 --> 5291.839999999999
you think that's the end of it it's

5290.0 --> 5294.639
gonna go back to peaceful protest

5291.84 --> 5296.0
no it's gonna get worse and then after

5294.639 --> 5298.56
that it's gonna get worse

5296.0 --> 5300.4
and then after that it's gonna be a

5298.56 --> 5303.360000000001
blood storm

5300.4 --> 5305.199
it's no way to stop it it's gonna happen

5303.36 --> 5307.5199999999995
whether you like it or not and i'm not

5305.199 --> 5309.28
advocating any of it

5307.52 --> 5312.88
it's just gonna happen it's an

5309.28 --> 5312.88
inevitable it's natural

5313.04 --> 5316.96
it's because people won't govern

5315.679 --> 5320.08
themselves

5316.96 --> 5323.52
that they are feeding into

5320.08 --> 5326.48
and giving reason for the existence of

5323.52 --> 5327.1990000000005
government and then government that is

5326.48 --> 5330.879999999999
controlling

5327.199 --> 5333.678999999999
an invasive and you know terrifying

5330.88 --> 5333.679
and uh

5334.84 --> 5341.4400000000005
anti-human yep openly unreasonable

5338.8 --> 5342.8
yeah absolutely it's always us and them

5341.44 --> 5345.599999999999
us against them but also

5342.8 --> 5347.679
openly unreasonable being openly like

5345.6 --> 5351.04
yeah this doesn't make any sense

5347.679 --> 5351.04
but we're gonna do it anyway

5351.6 --> 5357.84
and it just you know it just extends out

5354.719 --> 5361.04
and if if you can see how one

5357.84 --> 5361.76
act will affect everyone in your area in

5361.04 --> 5364.88
your

5361.76 --> 5367.12
area of influence and it ripples out

5364.88 --> 5370.08
from there i keep saying

5367.12 --> 5370.32
you're not alone you can't say that what

5370.08 --> 5373.76
i

5370.32 --> 5376.96
do doesn't matter it does

5373.76 --> 5379.04
and it matters greatly if it's done with

5376.96 --> 5381.52
good intention

5379.04 --> 5383.04
and if it's a stupid idea done with good

5381.52 --> 5385.52
intention it's still less

5383.04 --> 5386.32
less damaging than if it was a

5385.52 --> 5390.4800000000005
deliberate

5386.32 --> 5394.159
intentional evil act or even words

5390.48 --> 5394.159
yeah holy crap

5394.96 --> 5401.44
what is it anyway um

5398.4 --> 5404.48
yeah words are seeds words are seeds

5401.44 --> 5406.5599999999995
you need to garden wisely and so

5404.48 --> 5409.04
what comes out of our mouths is what's

5406.56 --> 5412.400000000001
in our heart and on our minds

5409.04 --> 5416.0
and it's revealing and if you want to

5412.4 --> 5420.159
have a good harvest of pleasant

5416.0 --> 5423.679
fruit and um pleasantness

5420.159 --> 5427.199
in your area uh

5423.679 --> 5431.04
plant good words right and also

5427.199 --> 5434.5599999999995
uh what is it called the word

5431.04 --> 5437.5199999999995
upheaval the soil actually yes

5434.56 --> 5438.320000000001
do that get the ropes out of there get

5437.52 --> 5441.4400000000005
the crap

5438.32 --> 5444.719
out of there the poison make it loose

5441.44 --> 5448.5599999999995
and actually make it into viable ground

5444.719 --> 5450.32
and feed it right because the earth

5448.56 --> 5453.1990000000005
that when you starve the earth you

5450.32 --> 5453.199
starve yourself

5455.6 --> 5459.679
yeah tilling the soil that's right you

5460.84 --> 5465.76
think

5462.48 --> 5468.48
feed the birds that as well

5465.76 --> 5470.400000000001
i do with my leftover bread and they

5468.48 --> 5472.5599999999995
love it

5470.4 --> 5476.08
they know they can get organic bread

5472.56 --> 5479.679
over here

5476.08 --> 5481.12
they fight over it oh yeah

5479.679 --> 5482.719
that's the here's the place where the

5481.12 --> 5485.92
good stuff

5482.719 --> 5488.88
is available so i am gonna

5485.92 --> 5491.1990000000005
round out the show i think it's okay it

5488.88 --> 5494.8
went very long and

5491.199 --> 5494.799999999999
need to settle down for a bit

5495.36 --> 5502.839999999999
well i'm glad i'm glad we went a little

5499.36 --> 5506.0
i'm glad we got to vent a little

5502.84 --> 5506.88
right without going crazy overboard

5506.0 --> 5510.159
whatever they want

5506.88 --> 5512.2390000000005
it makes me so nervous in a way

5510.159 --> 5515.44
and at the same time i realized like

5512.239 --> 5517.599999999999
look if you think that i'm being extreme

5515.44 --> 5518.5599999999995
there are some people out there on

5517.6 --> 5521.679
youtube

5518.56 --> 5526.639
that are going completely hitler

5521.679 --> 5526.639
insane totally over the top

5526.88 --> 5533.1990000000005
okay so i am like the most modest person

5530.48 --> 5534.32
basically talking about this that you're

5533.199 --> 5538.719
gonna find

5534.32 --> 5542.48
but still it unnerves me it just well

5538.719 --> 5545.12
it opened the door our win and we're

5542.48 --> 5546.48
we're going to see the effects of people

5545.12 --> 5549.599999999999
becoming more aware

5546.48 --> 5550.4
of what's going on that they can't see

5549.6 --> 5552.56
with their eyes

5550.4 --> 5554.5599999999995
they have to sense it they have to

5552.56 --> 5557.04
observe and perceive

5554.56 --> 5557.6
that there's some really bad [ __ ] going

5557.04 --> 5560.96
down

5557.6 --> 5564.159000000001
and they can help to either

5560.96 --> 5566.88
direct it away or to um

5564.159 --> 5567.599999999999
kill it you know kill the bad stuff well

5566.88 --> 5570.8
the thing is

5567.6 --> 5573.76
also and it's kind of weird

5570.8 --> 5575.1990000000005
it's like when when some people go to

5573.76 --> 5578.639
war

5575.199 --> 5579.28
then they still need other people to

5578.639 --> 5582.88
help them

5579.28 --> 5586.0
it's like the economy it's like if these

5582.88 --> 5586.719
these self-made troops are just gonna do

5586.0 --> 5588.48
this

5586.719 --> 5590.8
they're gonna need people on the

5588.48 --> 5591.44
sidelines to basically help them out by

5590.8 --> 5594.159000000001
giving them

5591.44 --> 5595.12
drinks or food or just encouragement

5594.159 --> 5598.5599999999995
that kind of [ __ ]

5595.12 --> 5602.32
so if you're like okay i could never

5598.56 --> 5605.360000000001
do anything violent or any you can still

5602.32 --> 5606.96
just be supportive in some way when when

5605.36 --> 5610.239
it really goes down

5606.96 --> 5612.639
you know help them out uh

5610.239 --> 5613.44
it's so complex like when that shit's

5612.639 --> 5616.96
gonna happen

5613.44 --> 5617.759999999999
it's gonna be chaos but you will

5616.96 --> 5620.4800000000005
recognize

5617.76 --> 5622.4800000000005
who is absolutely evil and who is not

5620.48 --> 5626.48
who is a total statist

5622.48 --> 5629.759999999999
psychopath that just is a psychopath

5626.48 --> 5630.0
so blatantly obvious so uncaring and who

5629.76 --> 5634.159000000001
is

5630.0 --> 5636.56
actually like because just being part of

5634.159 --> 5637.679
of the resistance it's gonna be a crazy

5636.56 --> 5639.6
crazy time

5637.679 --> 5642.56
and i don't know when it's gonna happen

5639.6 --> 5646.159000000001
but i know it is gonna happen

5642.56 --> 5646.159000000001
because history repeats itself

5646.8 --> 5651.12
we keep going through these certain

5649.04 --> 5654.239
cycles but anyway

5651.12 --> 5657.44
so um i guess

5654.239 --> 5660.0
a few in the nathan's chat room

5657.44 --> 5662.638999999999
right i'll be glad to talk about

5660.0 --> 5662.639
something else

5664.239 --> 5668.879999999999
let's get back to globe or grilling

5670.239 --> 5675.04
all right let's get back to the global

5672.88 --> 5679.6
barbecue

5675.04 --> 5679.6
yeah okay good old bar

wow well that was something

5699.6 --> 5703.76
i never see it coming when suddenly

5701.6 --> 5707.76
these type of subjects just pop up

5703.76 --> 5710.639
i really don't it's like i don't plan to

5707.76 --> 5712.719
talk about this [ __ ] it just happens it

5710.639 --> 5717.119
just happens

5712.719 --> 5720.0
and it freaks me out it really does it's

5717.119 --> 5721.28
it takes me away from my safe space

5720.0 --> 5723.76
because

5721.28 --> 5725.04
yeah suddenly realize yeah what kind of

5723.76 --> 5728.56
predicament is

5725.04 --> 5731.92
all in

5728.56 --> 5732.96
it's heavy very very heavy and you can't

5731.92 --> 5736.96
escape from it not

5732.96 --> 5739.04
really you can only escape from it if

5736.96 --> 5742.96
you blind yourself

5739.04 --> 5746.8
and i'm not gonna do that

5742.96 --> 5750.08
so anyway

5746.8 --> 5756.08
thanks everyone for coming

5750.08 --> 5759.5199999999995
make earth flat again

5756.08 --> 5762.639

5764.56 --> 5769.679
i want one i'm gonna see

5767.6 --> 5771.76
how if it can be done would be cool if

5769.679 --> 5775.04

5771.76 --> 5775.04
mass produced or anything

5776.719 --> 5784.8
the zulian perspective oh dear

5788.32 --> 5791.679
[ __ ] right

5801.28 --> 5806.5599999999995
